[00:00.000 --> 00:03.000]  Okay, this is the swearing-in of Donald Trump.
[00:03.000 --> 00:32.000]  Please raise your right hand and repeat after me. I, Donald John Trump, do solemnly swear that I will faithfully execute the office of President of the United States.
[00:36.000 --> 00:50.000]  And will, to the best of my ability, preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States.
[00:50.000 --> 00:52.000]  So help me God.
[00:52.000 --> 00:53.000]  So help me God.
[00:53.000 --> 00:55.000]  Congratulations, Mr. President.
[00:55.000 --> 01:05.000]  Here we go. Donald Trump is President. Okay, I'd welcome the radio audience. This is the Alex Jones show. I'm David Knight here with Leanne McAdoo.
[01:05.000 --> 01:13.000]  You're joining our live coverage of Donald Trump's inauguration and, as you just heard, he has just been sworn in as President of the United States.
[01:13.000 --> 01:28.000]  And there he is with his family. The oath of office was given to Vice President Pence a little bit earlier by Clarence Thomas, Supreme Court Justice. That was Justice Roberts, the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, swearing in Donald Trump as President.
[01:28.000 --> 01:31.000]  It is now an accomplished fact.
[01:31.000 --> 01:36.000]  Barack Obama is no longer President.
[01:36.000 --> 01:42.000]  You mean the Resist Movement, the Never Trump, and the Disrupt J-20 weren't able to stop this?
[01:42.000 --> 01:43.000]  Right.
[01:43.000 --> 01:50.000]  Do you think they're going to get a little dose of reality now and accept this or accept that this has really happened?
[01:50.000 --> 01:55.000]  Joy and Shadenfreude at the same time.
[01:55.000 --> 02:02.000]  And there is a 21-gun salute that is going off with some cannons after the swearing-in ceremony.
[02:02.000 --> 02:12.000]  We should be having Donald Trump's speech. We're going to carry that live. For those of you who are radio affiliates, we'll be carrying Donald Trump's speech live.
[02:12.000 --> 02:20.000]  Donald J. Trump.
[02:20.000 --> 02:26.000]  Donald Trump has been sworn in, and now this is his speech.
[02:26.000 --> 02:39.000]  First speech as President of the United States.
[02:39.000 --> 02:55.000]  Chief Justice Roberts, President Carter, President Clinton, President Bush, President Obama, fellow Americans, and people of the world, thank you.
[02:55.000 --> 03:15.000]  We, the citizens of America, are now joined in a great national effort to rebuild our country and restore its promise for all of our people.
[03:15.000 --> 03:24.000]  Together we will determine the course of America and the world for many, many years to come.
[03:24.000 --> 03:32.000]  We will face challenges. We will confront hardships. But we will get the job done.
[03:32.000 --> 03:39.000]  Every four years we gather on these steps to carry out the orderly and peaceful transfer of power.
[03:39.000 --> 03:51.000]  And we are grateful to President Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama for their gracious aid throughout this transition.
[03:51.000 --> 03:58.000]  They have been magnificent. Thank you.
[03:58.000 --> 04:02.000]  And there you can see Hillary right behind Obama.
[04:02.000 --> 04:07.000]  Today's ceremony, however, has very special meaning.
[04:07.000 --> 04:16.000]  Because today we are not merely transferring power from one administration to another, or from one party to another.
[04:16.000 --> 04:29.000]  But we are transferring power from Washington, D.C. and giving it back to you, the people.
[04:29.000 --> 04:33.000]  That's a great line. Transferring power back to the people.
[04:33.000 --> 04:45.000]  For too long a small group in our nation's capital has reaped the rewards of government while the people have borne the cost.
[04:45.000 --> 04:52.000]  Washington flourished, but the people did not share in its wealth.
[04:52.000 --> 05:00.000]  Politicians prospered, but the jobs left and the factories closed.
[05:00.000 --> 05:07.000]  The establishment protected itself, but not the citizens of our country.
[05:07.000 --> 05:14.000]  Their victories have not been your victories. Their triumphs have not been your triumphs.
[05:14.000 --> 05:31.000]  And while they celebrated in our nation's capital, there was little to celebrate for struggling families all across our land.
[05:31.000 --> 05:49.000]  That all changes starting right here and right now, because this moment is your moment. It belongs to you.
[05:49.000 --> 05:56.000]  It belongs to everyone gathered here today and everyone watching all across America.
[05:56.000 --> 06:12.000]  This is your day. This is your celebration. And this, the United States of America, is your country.
[06:12.000 --> 06:25.000]  What truly matters is not which party controls our government, but whether our government is controlled by the people.
[06:25.000 --> 06:43.000]  January 20th, 2017 will be remembered as the day the people became the rulers of this nation again.
[06:43.000 --> 06:53.000]  The forgotten men and women of our country will be forgotten no longer.
[06:53.000 --> 07:10.000]  Everyone is listening to you now. You came by the tens of millions to become part of a historic movement, the likes of which the world has never seen before.
[07:10.000 --> 07:20.000]  At the center of this movement is a crucial conviction that a nation exists to serve its citizens.
[07:20.000 --> 07:31.000]  Americans want great schools for their children, safe neighborhoods for their families, and good jobs for themselves.
[07:31.000 --> 07:41.000]  These are just and reasonable demands of righteous people and a righteous public.
[07:41.000 --> 07:50.000]  But too many of our citizens a different reality exists. Mothers and children trapped in poverty in our inner cities,
[07:50.000 --> 07:57.000]  rusted out factories scattered like tombstones across the landscape of our nation,
[07:57.000 --> 08:08.000]  an education system flush with cash but which leaves our young and beautiful students deprived of all knowledge,
[08:08.000 --> 08:20.000]  and the crime, and the gangs, and the drugs that have stolen too many lives and robbed our country of so much unrealized potential.
[08:20.000 --> 08:37.000]  This American carnage stops right here and stops right now.
[08:37.000 --> 08:48.000]  We are one nation, and their pain is our pain. Their dreams are our dreams, and their success will be our success.
[08:48.000 --> 08:56.000]  We share one heart, one home, and one glorious destiny.
[08:56.000 --> 09:07.000]  The oath of office I take today is an oath of allegiance to all Americans.
[09:07.000 --> 09:14.000]  For many decades, we've enriched foreign industry at the expense of American industry,
[09:14.000 --> 09:23.000]  subsidized the armies of other countries while allowing for the very sad depletion of our military.
[09:23.000 --> 09:32.000]  We've defended other nations' borders while refusing to defend our own.
[09:32.000 --> 09:38.000]  Welcome to our radio audience. I'm David Knight with Leanne McAdoo. This is live coverage of Donald Trump's inaugurations.
[09:38.000 --> 10:00.000]  The millions of dollars overseas while America's infrastructure has fallen into disrepair and decay. We've made other countries rich while the wealth, strength, and confidence of our country has dissipated over the horizon.
[10:00.000 --> 10:15.000]  One by one, the factories shuttered and left our shores with not even a thought about the millions and millions of American workers that were left behind.
[10:15.000 --> 10:26.000]  The wealth of our middle class has been ripped from their homes and then redistributed all across the world.
[10:26.000 --> 10:38.000]  But that is the past, and now we are looking only to the future.
[10:38.000 --> 10:42.000]  It's really great how this speech is not being made about Donald Trump.
[10:42.000 --> 11:00.000]  We assembled here today are issuing a new decree to be heard in every city, in every foreign capital, and in every hall of power. From this day forward, a new vision will govern our land.
[11:00.000 --> 11:12.000]  From this day forward, it's going to be only America first. America first.
[11:12.000 --> 11:28.000]  He's been elected president of America, not the leader of global cartels. On trade, on taxes, on immigration, on foreign affairs will be made to benefit American workers and American families.
[11:28.000 --> 11:41.000]  We must protect our borders from the ravages of other countries, making our products, stealing our companies, and destroying our jobs.
[11:41.000 --> 11:47.000]  That's right, in eight weeks he did more than Barack Obama did in eight years to bring jobs to America to keep the community.
[11:47.000 --> 12:05.000]  Protection will lead to great prosperity and strength. I will fight for you with every breath in my body, and I will never, ever let you down.
[12:05.000 --> 12:11.000]  America will start winning again, winning like never before.
[12:11.000 --> 12:14.000]  We're not going to get tired of it.
[12:14.000 --> 12:32.000]  We will bring back our jobs, we will bring back our borders, we will bring back our wealth, and we will bring back our dreams.
[12:32.000 --> 12:44.000]  We will build new roads, and highways, and bridges, and airports, and tunnels, and railways all across our wonderful nation.
[12:44.000 --> 12:54.000]  We will get our people off of welfare and back to work, rebuilding our country with American hands and American labor.
[12:54.000 --> 12:59.000]  And all the Democrats.
[12:59.000 --> 13:07.000]  We will follow two simple rules, buy American and hire American.
[13:07.000 --> 13:09.000]  Paul Ryan doesn't like that.
[13:09.000 --> 13:23.000]  We will seek friendship and goodwill with the nations of the world, but we do so with the understanding that it is the right of all nations to put their own interests first.
[13:23.000 --> 13:39.000]  We do not seek to impose our way of life on anyone, but rather to let it shine as an example, we will shine for everyone to follow.
[13:39.000 --> 14:00.000]  We will reinforce old alliances and form new ones, and unite the civilized world against radical Islamic terrorism, which we will eradicate completely from the face of the earth.
[14:00.000 --> 14:15.000]  At the bedrock of our politics will be a total allegiance to the United States of America, and through our loyalty to our country, we will rediscover our loyalty to each other.
[14:15.000 --> 14:25.000]  When you open your heart to patriotism, there is no room for prejudice.
[14:25.000 --> 14:38.000]  The Bible tells us how good and pleasant it is when God's people live together in unity.
[14:38.000 --> 14:48.000]  We must speak our minds openly, debate our disagreements honestly, but always pursue solidarity.
[14:48.000 --> 14:57.000]  When America is united, America is totally unstoppable.
[14:57.000 --> 15:03.000]  Again, we're covering the speech of Donald Trump after his inauguration.
[15:03.000 --> 15:23.000]  And we will always be protected. We will be protected by the great men and women of our military and law enforcement, and most importantly, we will be protected by God.
[15:23.000 --> 15:40.000]  We must think big and dream even bigger. In America, we understand that a nation is only living as long as it is striving.
[15:40.000 --> 15:58.000]  We will no longer accept politicians who are all talk and no action constantly complaining but never doing anything about it.
[15:58.000 --> 16:08.000]  The time for empty talk is over. Now arrives the hour of action.
[16:08.000 --> 16:11.000]  He's already been pretty active.
[16:11.000 --> 16:22.000]  Do not allow anyone to tell you that it cannot be done. No challenge can match the heart and fight and spirit of America.
[16:22.000 --> 16:29.000]  We will not fail. Our country will thrive and prosper again.
[16:29.000 --> 16:46.000]  We stand at the birth of a new millennium ready to unlock the mysteries of space, to free the earth from the miseries of disease, and to harness the energies, industries, and technologies of tomorrow.
[16:46.000 --> 17:15.000]  A new national pride will stir ourselves, lift our sights, and heal our divisions. It's time to remember that all wisdom our soldiers will never forget that whether we are black or brown or white, we all bleed the same red blood of patriots.
[17:15.000 --> 17:28.000]  We all enjoy the same glorious freedoms, and we all salute the same great American flag.
[17:28.000 --> 17:55.000]  Whether a child is born in the urban sprawl of Detroit or the windswept plains of Nebraska, they look up at the same night sky, they fill their heart with the same dreams, and they are infused with the breath of life by the same almighty creator.
[17:55.000 --> 18:14.000]  So to all Americans in every city, near and far, small and large, from mountain to mountain, from ocean to ocean, hear these words, you will never be ignored again.
[18:14.000 --> 18:29.000]  Your voice, your hopes, and your dreams will define our American destiny, and your courage and goodness and love will forever guide us along the way.
[18:29.000 --> 18:49.000]  Together, we will make America strong again. We will make America wealthy again. We will make America proud again. We will make America safe again. And yes, together, we will make America great again.
[18:49.000 --> 19:00.000]  Thank you, God bless you, and God bless America. Thank you. God bless America.
[19:00.000 --> 19:21.000]  Alright, you've been listening to the first speech of President Trump. He's now been sworn in at the inaugural, and that was his first speech. And of course, Leigh Ann, as he was talking about that, he focused not on himself, but he focused on the people. He said, not from one person to another, not from one party to another, but power has been transferred back to the people.
[19:21.000 --> 19:27.000]  It's not which party controls government, but if government is controlled by the people.
[19:27.000 --> 19:34.000]  I can only imagine if Hillary Clinton would have been giving that speech, it would have been all about social policies.
[19:34.000 --> 19:39.000]  I am the first woman. You notice I'm a woman? I am the first woman here to be prime president.
[19:39.000 --> 19:41.000]  I've broken through the glass ceiling.
[19:41.000 --> 19:44.000]  Oh, we would have heard glass ceiling, glass ceiling, glass ceiling.
[19:44.000 --> 19:50.000]  It would have been all about her, and that was very refreshing. It'll be interesting to see how people try to tear that speech apart.
[19:50.000 --> 20:00.000]  He made this not about himself, as Hillary Clinton would have made it about her, and about her being a woman. He made it about the people. He said, you are the people who are, the people are supposed to control the government.
[20:00.000 --> 20:01.000]  That's what we're going to have happen.
[20:01.000 --> 20:02.000]  Right.
[20:02.000 --> 20:09.000]  And of course, he also made a comment that is absolutely going to set the mainstream media ablaze.
[20:09.000 --> 20:18.000]  They are going to be absolutely incensed about the fact that he said we will eradicate radical Islam from the face of the earth.
[20:18.000 --> 20:27.000]  That's a phrase that Obama and the left and the mainstream media could barely bring themselves to say in the face of a terrorist shooting.
[20:27.000 --> 20:33.000]  They couldn't talk about radical Islam. And he called it out and said we will eradicate radical Islam from the face of the earth.
[20:33.000 --> 20:47.000]  They only uttered those words finally, Hillary Clinton, when she was campaigning this last year and she was forced to have to do it because she could see that that was what was helping Donald Trump really connect with the worries that the American people were having.
[20:47.000 --> 20:52.000]  She finally uttered those words, but it was pretty interesting.
[20:52.000 --> 20:57.000]  We have this report that I think is up on info wars.com from Daily Mail.
[20:57.000 --> 21:01.000]  Obama's legacy, eight years, 3,000 regulations, $8 trillion in debt.
[21:01.000 --> 21:03.000]  I think that's, I would disagree with those.
[21:03.000 --> 21:04.000]  8,000 regulations.
[21:04.000 --> 21:14.000]  Yeah, I would disagree with those numbers because from what I saw, and I'll have to go back and get my source, it was 3,400 regulations in 2015 alone.
[21:14.000 --> 21:24.000]  So maybe this is a little over 3,000 regulations in 2016 alone because they're talking about 97,000 pages in 2016 alone in all time record.
[21:24.000 --> 21:27.000]  I think that there may be some confusion on that.
[21:27.000 --> 21:33.000]  As I reported earlier, they have accelerated the number of regulations and talk about midnight regulations.
[21:33.000 --> 21:40.000]  That's what they call the lame duck regulations from the election onto the swearing end of the next president.
[21:40.000 --> 21:44.000]  But of course, we really truly did have midnight regulations brought in last night.
[21:44.000 --> 21:48.000]  We had a massive, I think it was something like 1,500 pages of regulations.
[21:48.000 --> 21:55.000]  I read that article earlier today, just last night from the chain, the people who are forging our chains there and the bureaucracy.
[21:55.000 --> 22:06.000]  This is what Obama has used his pen and his phone for, not to save jobs, not to keep companies from moving jobs to other countries, not to entice them to bring jobs here.
[22:06.000 --> 22:10.000]  I'm not to say to people, look, you've got these jobs, these factories in other countries.
[22:10.000 --> 22:16.000]  Understand that it'll be to your economic interest to move that production to the United States, which is what other countries have done.
[22:16.000 --> 22:18.000]  It's what China has done.
[22:18.000 --> 22:22.000]  China has unabashedly protected its own markets.
[22:22.000 --> 22:27.000]  They've made it very difficult for other people to do business there and they have done everything to incentivize it.
[22:27.000 --> 22:33.000]  We see this all the time in terms of the massive ships that are coming from China going to Walmart,
[22:33.000 --> 22:39.000]  coming here heavily laden, record-sized ships and yet they return completely empty.
[22:39.000 --> 22:43.000]  And so this is something that Donald Trump has done, even though he wasn't president.
[22:43.000 --> 22:49.000]  He did more as president elect to save jobs than we saw President Obama do.
[22:49.000 --> 22:51.000]  President Obama has been costing us jobs.
[22:51.000 --> 22:55.000]  When you go into debt, when you create this kind of regulation and you don't do any,
[22:55.000 --> 23:01.000]  that kills jobs regardless of whether they're sending the jobs abroad or bringing in foreign workers.
[23:01.000 --> 23:04.000]  Absolutely. And I reported on the nightly news the other night.
[23:04.000 --> 23:08.000]  It was more like 80,000 plus per year in these regulations.
[23:08.000 --> 23:12.000]  So there must be a different thing working on here with those numbers.
[23:12.000 --> 23:14.000]  Yeah, I think there needs to be some clarification.
[23:14.000 --> 23:17.000]  This is really understating it even, I think, the $8 trillion.
[23:17.000 --> 23:19.000]  I mean, we're well over $20 trillion.
[23:19.000 --> 23:24.000]  Yeah, Drudge leaves USA $9.335 trillion deeper in debt.
[23:24.000 --> 23:27.000]  So obviously those numbers are a little off there.
[23:27.000 --> 23:32.000]  Yeah, President Obama kept breaking the record for the amount of regulations that were,
[23:32.000 --> 23:35.000]  even though he only signed like 1,300 bills into law.
[23:35.000 --> 23:41.000]  So for those 1,300 bills into law, there were thousands and thousands of regulations,
[23:41.000 --> 23:45.000]  which of course is only going to stymie businesses and small businesses
[23:45.000 --> 23:47.000]  are going to be the most affected by those regulations.
[23:47.000 --> 23:52.000]  That's right. And that's been a problem with both the Republican and Democrat control congresses.
[23:52.000 --> 23:57.000]  It's not just Obama and his executive orders, but they do not want to create the laws.
[23:57.000 --> 24:00.000]  They want to pass that power on to the bureaucracy.
[24:00.000 --> 24:06.000]  And both people like Paul Ryan and John Boehner as well as Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer and Harry Reid,
[24:06.000 --> 24:08.000]  they're all happy to do that.
[24:08.000 --> 24:11.000]  Hopefully that is something that is going to change under President Trump.
[24:11.000 --> 24:14.000]  We have a story that is breaking at infowars.com.
[24:14.000 --> 24:19.000]  Police allow Black Lives Matter to attack women at a Trump inauguration.
[24:19.000 --> 24:23.000]  And I think we've got a video for this, guys. Do we have a video that we can show here?
[24:23.000 --> 24:25.000]  Or is that just a report that we've got?
[24:25.000 --> 24:26.000]  B-roll.
[24:26.000 --> 24:29.000]  I think we have some video. The article is up on infowars.com.
[24:29.000 --> 24:32.000]  And of course, that's what Alex Jones and the rest of the crew,
[24:32.000 --> 24:36.000]  who are now live on the streets of Washington, D.C., have been talking about.
[24:36.000 --> 24:43.000]  The fact that the police have been pretty passive in the face of violent protesters,
[24:43.000 --> 24:46.000]  not only blocking people's access to the inauguration,
[24:46.000 --> 24:51.000]  getting at the entrance there before they go through the security services,
[24:51.000 --> 24:54.000]  keeping people from getting into the inauguration itself,
[24:54.000 --> 24:59.000]  but also attacking people, attacking women, hitting people with sucker punches.
[24:59.000 --> 25:02.000]  And there you can see Alex Jones. That's a Facebook mention there, I think.
[25:02.000 --> 25:03.000]  Yeah.
[25:03.000 --> 25:05.000]  That we have going on there. You can see that live stream.
[25:05.000 --> 25:12.000]  And I tweeted out a video a little earlier this morning of the crowd there, the barricade of bodies.
[25:12.000 --> 25:18.000]  They were not allowing one of these Trump supporters to get into the inauguration,
[25:18.000 --> 25:20.000]  and they actually separated him from his wife.
[25:20.000 --> 25:23.000]  So here he is on the other side of the barricade of people,
[25:23.000 --> 25:26.000]  and they're not allowing his wife to come through.
[25:26.000 --> 25:28.000]  And she's freaking out, and he's freaking out.
[25:28.000 --> 25:34.000]  Now you're messing with people's primal urges to want to bludgeon you over the head,
[25:34.000 --> 25:37.000]  but of course, he can't fight back against that.
[25:37.000 --> 25:40.000]  I mean, how would you have reacted if they separated you from Karen?
[25:40.000 --> 25:42.000]  That is not speech, okay?
[25:42.000 --> 25:45.000]  We have to understand, when the left goes out here, they've said things like,
[25:45.000 --> 25:50.000]  well, you know what, we need to have a government subsidy for us to create quote-unquote art
[25:50.000 --> 25:54.000]  that has a container of urine with a crucifix in it.
[25:54.000 --> 25:58.000]  And so that's our free speech, and you need to subsidize that to make it free for us, okay?
[25:58.000 --> 26:00.000]  That's not what free speech is, folks.
[26:00.000 --> 26:05.000]  Free speech is political speech, and that's precisely what they do not want to have.
[26:05.000 --> 26:07.000]  They don't want to have any political speech.
[26:07.000 --> 26:10.000]  They don't want to back and forth, and they want to shut you down,
[26:10.000 --> 26:13.000]  and they won't even, when you give them the microphone to talk to the audience,
[26:13.000 --> 26:18.000]  they won't even use that to talk to people to tell them what they think.
[26:18.000 --> 26:21.000]  Well, just like the free speech that we had at the inauguration,
[26:21.000 --> 26:25.000]  when the crowd went wild booing and chanting,
[26:25.000 --> 26:29.000]  lock her up when they announced Hillary Clinton and Bill Clinton walking down,
[26:29.000 --> 26:32.000]  so the entire crowd chanting, lock her up.
[26:32.000 --> 26:34.000]  And, you know, of course, you've got to be gracious,
[26:34.000 --> 26:38.000]  maybe that's why she looked a little upset there.
[26:38.000 --> 26:42.000]  Again, we're going to run through, for those of you that are listening on the Internet,
[26:42.000 --> 26:45.000]  we're going to run through live with our coverage of the inauguration.
[26:45.000 --> 26:47.000]  I'm David Knight with Leanne McAdoo.
[26:47.000 --> 26:53.000]  We also have our crew in Washington, D.C., and we hear the singing that's going on there.
[26:53.000 --> 26:57.000]  Also, I want to remind you that to help support that Infowars Ground crew
[26:57.000 --> 27:01.000]  and our efforts to bring that information to you live, as we see the protesters there,
[27:01.000 --> 27:03.000]  we give you the side of it that the mainstream media is not going to give you.
[27:03.000 --> 27:06.000]  We have also put some specials out there for you.
[27:06.000 --> 27:08.000]  So we want to make this a win-win situation.
[27:08.000 --> 27:13.000]  We appreciate your support of us, and we want to support you to help you get the kinds of resources
[27:13.000 --> 27:18.000]  in terms of health products, supplements, be able to afford that.
[27:18.000 --> 27:21.000]  We've put some of our bestsellers on sale at infowarslife.com.
[27:21.000 --> 27:23.000]  We have 20 to 30 percent off.
[27:23.000 --> 27:26.000]  This is our sale that we began at the beginning of the new year,
[27:26.000 --> 27:30.000]  and we have continued that through to the inauguration that will be ending very soon.
[27:30.000 --> 27:38.000]  We have also added an inauguration special, and that is Infowars Select Storeable Food at 30 to 40 percent off.
[27:38.000 --> 27:42.000]  You can find Infowars Select Storeable Food, 34 percent off at Infowars Store,
[27:42.000 --> 27:47.000]  and at Infowars Life, you will find supplements like Supermail Vitality, 30 percent off,
[27:47.000 --> 27:52.000]  Brainforce Plus, 30 percent off, DNA Force, back in stock now at 10 percent off.
[27:52.000 --> 27:56.000]  So that is the way that we fund our operation here.
[27:56.000 --> 28:02.000]  We appreciate your support, and those are sales that will be ending soon,
[28:02.000 --> 28:05.000]  tied to the inauguration to the beginning of the new year.
[28:05.000 --> 28:12.000]  Well, I've just been handed some news that despite multiple polls from the fake news outlets that are out there
[28:12.000 --> 28:17.000]  trying to tell people that Donald Trump is just public enemy number one,
[28:17.000 --> 28:22.000]  the majority of Americans view Trump favorably according to the latest polls.
[28:22.000 --> 28:26.000]  This was about 52 percent now.
[28:26.000 --> 28:31.000]  So they keep trying to say it's hovering around 40 percent, but, you know, they're going to...
[28:31.000 --> 28:34.000]  It's not rocket science. He just won the election, folks.
[28:34.000 --> 28:37.000]  And here's another metric for you.
[28:37.000 --> 28:43.000]  If you're confused about these competing polls, just take a look at how the NFL
[28:43.000 --> 28:48.000]  that has been taking the position of Kaepernick and others,
[28:48.000 --> 28:53.000]  look at how they have plummeted in popularity, and I think it is tied to that.
[28:53.000 --> 28:58.000]  I don't think it is anything other than that, and they continue to come out with that.
[28:58.000 --> 29:01.000]  They're going to be using the Super Bowl probably.
[29:01.000 --> 29:07.000]  The entertainers that will be there will be given an opportunity platform to criticize Donald Trump,
[29:07.000 --> 29:11.000]  and I'm sure that's what they'll do, and there you can see Donald Trump waving goodbye to the crowd.
[29:11.000 --> 29:17.000]  He has been sworn in. He's given his speech and his speech focused on a transfer of power,
[29:17.000 --> 29:20.000]  not to him, not to a party, but to the people.
[29:20.000 --> 29:23.000]  He said, this is not a transfer from one person to the other,
[29:23.000 --> 29:26.000]  exactly the opposite of what we would have heard from Hillary Clinton.
[29:26.000 --> 29:31.000]  She would have been basking in the glory of her identity politics if she had won,
[29:31.000 --> 29:33.000]  but he was talking about how this is a movement.
[29:33.000 --> 29:36.000]  We're going to take back power, give it to the people.
[29:36.000 --> 29:38.000]  The people are going to now be controlling the government,
[29:38.000 --> 29:43.000]  and a very, very different type of speech than we would have heard from Hillary Clinton.
[29:43.000 --> 29:49.000]  Right, as it should be, and I got to say, I even moved a little bit watching Melania come down.
[29:49.000 --> 29:56.000]  I mean, they are just American people who ended up becoming very successful, just Americans,
[29:56.000 --> 30:02.000]  and now here they are. They weren't politically active their entire life like the Clintons.
[30:02.000 --> 30:07.000]  Yeah, all right, so we're going to go to break, and we're going to be right back.
[30:07.000 --> 30:11.000]  Stay with us. We'll be returning with our live coverage of Donald Trump's inauguration.
[30:11.000 --> 30:19.000]  MUSIC
[30:19.000 --> 30:23.000]  We're on the march. The empire's on the run.
[30:23.000 --> 30:27.000]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[30:31.000 --> 30:33.000]  Migrants are racing for the U.S. border.
[30:33.000 --> 30:37.000]  Right before Trump is taking office, there's an article that's up on the Drudge Report
[30:37.000 --> 30:41.000]  that talks about how illegals are coming for the U.S. border.
[30:41.000 --> 30:43.000]  In lieu of a Trump victory, he's taking office tomorrow, folks.
[30:43.000 --> 30:47.000]  Migrants that are trying to sneak into the U.S. on the last day of what they see
[30:47.000 --> 30:50.000]  because they realize that a wall is in fact coming.
[30:50.000 --> 30:53.000]  These challenges are nothing compared to a bigger fear they have
[30:53.000 --> 30:58.000]  that someday soon U.S. President-elect Donald Trump will build that wall and keep them out altogether.
[30:58.000 --> 31:01.000]  So before Trump takes office tomorrow, they're racing against time,
[31:01.000 --> 31:05.000]  riding a freight train up to the border to look for a way across.
[31:05.000 --> 31:09.000]  In the town, near a frontier group of Hondurans warn themselves near a fire,
[31:09.000 --> 31:11.000]  a trash in the early morning cold.
[31:11.000 --> 31:16.000]  There's an article that YouTube has put up showing these migrants ready to jump the train
[31:16.000 --> 31:18.000]  and the event that it slows down.
[31:18.000 --> 31:21.000]  And I've got news for you, folks. That wall is coming.
[31:21.000 --> 31:25.000]  But it looks like migrants are feeling the burn, literally, and racing for the border.
[31:25.000 --> 31:28.000]  I'm Margaret Hale reporting for Infowars.com.
[31:30.000 --> 31:32.000]  It's not just our water we need to filter.
[31:32.000 --> 31:37.000]  It's not just our food that needs to be cleaned. It's the air we're breathing, especially for our children.
[31:37.000 --> 31:43.000]  The artificial particulates of the chemicals is absolutely weighing down our immune systems.
[31:43.000 --> 31:49.000]  The same team based right here in America that brought you the Alexa Pure Groundbreaking Water Filtration Systems
[31:49.000 --> 31:52.000]  have now developed Alexa Pure Breeze.
[31:52.000 --> 31:57.000]  Whether it's your home or office, you owe it to yourself, your coworkers, your family, your children.
[31:57.000 --> 32:00.000]  Through the best job you can to purify your air.
[32:00.000 --> 32:05.000]  The elite are masters at poisoning our environment while themselves doing things that mitigate
[32:05.000 --> 32:08.000]  or avoid most toxic effects for themselves.
[32:08.000 --> 32:10.000]  The general public doesn't.
[32:10.000 --> 32:14.000]  The Alexa Pure Breeze will be a steal at $300, $400, $500.
[32:14.000 --> 32:18.000]  One of these systems can keep 800 square feet incredibly clean.
[32:18.000 --> 32:20.000]  This is a system I'm personally putting in throughout my house,
[32:20.000 --> 32:24.000]  replacing older, more expensive filters that didn't do as good a job.
[32:24.000 --> 32:27.000]  Find out why this system is so revolutionary today.
[32:27.000 --> 32:30.000]  Then fullwarstore.com
[33:21.000 --> 33:26.000]  Get great products, help fund the info war and celebrate the election of a populist,
[33:26.000 --> 33:28.000]  champion against the new world order.
[33:28.000 --> 33:31.000]  I'm Alex Jones and this is The Info War.
[33:41.000 --> 33:47.000]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[33:51.000 --> 33:53.000]  Welcome back to The Alex Jones Show.
[33:53.000 --> 33:58.000]  We're in Austin with Leanne McAdoo. Our crew is live in Washington, D.C.
[33:58.000 --> 34:01.000]  Alex Jones was in the crowd at the inauguration.
[34:01.000 --> 34:05.000]  He'll be heading to our remote studio there in Washington, D.C.
[34:05.000 --> 34:10.000]  Coming on the show live, we're going to have this going well into tonight, our live coverage.
[34:10.000 --> 34:15.000]  Of course, we have other crew that are there looking to see what is happening on the streets.
[34:15.000 --> 34:18.000]  As reports that we've gotten back, we see that the police,
[34:18.000 --> 34:20.000]  and this is a report from InfoWars.com,
[34:20.000 --> 34:24.000]  that police allowed Black Lives Matter to attack women at a Trump inauguration.
[34:24.000 --> 34:27.000]  We have a street fight that has broken out near the inauguration.
[34:27.000 --> 34:29.000]  We have anti-Trump protesters smashing windows,
[34:29.000 --> 34:32.000]  vandalizing cars on the streets of Washington.
[34:32.000 --> 34:35.000]  They were keeping people from getting into the inauguration,
[34:35.000 --> 34:41.000]  getting at the security entrance there to try to prevent people from being able to attend this.
[34:41.000 --> 34:46.000]  And all of this is on their side while we see this,
[34:46.000 --> 34:50.000]  we see Marine Dowd claiming that the country is divided like Civil War.
[34:50.000 --> 34:53.000]  And I have to say, let's understand who is initiating this.
[34:53.000 --> 34:57.000]  Let's understand that it is California that wants to secede.
[34:57.000 --> 35:01.000]  And I would like to help them in any way that I possibly can.
[35:01.000 --> 35:02.000]  I understand that some of you...
[35:02.000 --> 35:04.000]  You don't need money to your cause.
[35:04.000 --> 35:07.000]  I understand that some of you in California are conservative,
[35:07.000 --> 35:09.000]  and you don't like what's happening there,
[35:09.000 --> 35:13.000]  but we would offer you the ability to stay in the Union.
[35:13.000 --> 35:18.000]  You could call it America, California, or New California.
[35:18.000 --> 35:21.000]  Whatever you want to call it, you could call it Free California maybe.
[35:21.000 --> 35:24.000]  That would be a good thing instead of like it did with...
[35:24.000 --> 35:27.000]  Instead of, you know, when they had the First Civil War,
[35:27.000 --> 35:28.000]  you had Virginia when they left.
[35:28.000 --> 35:30.000]  Western Virginia decided they wanted to stay.
[35:30.000 --> 35:33.000]  So you wound up with West Virginia and Virginia.
[35:33.000 --> 35:39.000]  So we could have a California which is its own nation or joins Mexico or something.
[35:39.000 --> 35:42.000]  And the rest of you could be Free California and you could stay with us.
[35:42.000 --> 35:43.000]  Let's let them go.
[35:43.000 --> 35:45.000]  Yeah. Okay. Now I see you're saying yes.
[35:45.000 --> 35:49.000]  The Free because I was going to say California is one of the most heavily regulated states...
[35:49.000 --> 35:50.000]  That's right.
[35:50.000 --> 35:51.000] ...in the country.
[35:51.000 --> 35:52.000]  The people who remain to be free.
[35:52.000 --> 35:55.000]  The rest of them could just be regular California with all the regulations,
[35:55.000 --> 35:56.000]  with all the taxes, with all the...
[35:56.000 --> 36:00.000]  Be free again, like the people who headed out West originally
[36:00.000 --> 36:02.000]  intended to be the free Wild West.
[36:02.000 --> 36:03.000]  That's right.
[36:03.000 --> 36:08.000]  And now it's just been reclaimed by these fascist liberals out there
[36:08.000 --> 36:09.000]  who want to regulate everything.
[36:09.000 --> 36:14.000]  Well, we carried the Trumps wearing in and we'll have clips of that,
[36:14.000 --> 36:16.000]  highlights of that that we'll be playing.
[36:16.000 --> 36:18.000]  But I think, Leigh Ann, the highlights for me,
[36:18.000 --> 36:20.000]  and I thought it was a very good speech.
[36:20.000 --> 36:23.000]  I did not go on forever like Barack Obama's speech.
[36:23.000 --> 36:25.000]  But it is farewell speech.
[36:25.000 --> 36:26.000]  And it's 92.
[36:26.000 --> 36:27.000]  The press corps.
[36:27.000 --> 36:28.000]  I, I, I, me, me, me, I.
[36:28.000 --> 36:30.000]  Yeah, he just could not get off the stage.
[36:30.000 --> 36:33.000]  But Donald Trump's speech was very concise,
[36:33.000 --> 36:34.000]  what was put together.
[36:34.000 --> 36:37.000]  But it focused on the fact that it was not about him.
[36:37.000 --> 36:41.000]  That power was not transferred from one individual to another,
[36:41.000 --> 36:42.000]  from one party to another.
[36:42.000 --> 36:47.000]  But he was there to preside over a transfer of power to the people.
[36:47.000 --> 36:48.000]  People.
[36:48.000 --> 36:51.000]  And that the government should be controlled by the people
[36:51.000 --> 36:53.000]  and not the other way around.
[36:53.000 --> 36:54.000]  It was a great speech.
[36:54.000 --> 36:57.000]  And I think one of the things that's going to come out of this,
[36:57.000 --> 37:01.000]  the left, and we're waiting for all of the mainstream media
[37:01.000 --> 37:04.000]  to get to their typewriters and start curiously typing away
[37:04.000 --> 37:05.000]  about the fact that he said,
[37:05.000 --> 37:08.000]  we will eradicate radical Islam from the face of the earth.
[37:08.000 --> 37:12.000]  A phrase that they loathe that they will not use,
[37:12.000 --> 37:16.000]  even in the wake of a terrorist event that the radical Muslims
[37:16.000 --> 37:19.000]  take credit for as being part of their jihad.
[37:19.000 --> 37:21.000]  They will not use a phrase, radical Islam.
[37:21.000 --> 37:23.000]  He couldn't even get Barack Obama to say that phrase.
[37:23.000 --> 37:25.000]  He said, not only the phrase, but he said,
[37:25.000 --> 37:28.000]  we will eradicate radical Islam from the face of the earth.
[37:28.000 --> 37:30.000]  And we're going to stop the crime.
[37:30.000 --> 37:34.000]  We're going to stop the loss of jobs that's going to end right here and now.
[37:34.000 --> 37:38.000]  So we're going to have those excerpts for you from President Trump.
[37:38.000 --> 37:43.000]  And there you see President Trump with former Obama.
[37:43.000 --> 37:44.000]  Oh, I just have a problem.
[37:44.000 --> 37:45.000]  Sorry, folks.
[37:45.000 --> 37:46.000]  I'm coming.
[37:46.000 --> 37:49.000]  I do have a bias and I am not ashamed of it.
[37:49.000 --> 37:52.000]  I do have a problem calling Obama president
[37:52.000 --> 37:56.000]  because I don't ever think that he was qualified to take the office.
[37:56.000 --> 37:58.000]  I don't believe that even if you took him at his word
[37:58.000 --> 38:01.000]  with his falsified birth certificate that he was a natural born citizen.
[38:01.000 --> 38:06.000]  Well, it'll be really interesting to see how, like you said,
[38:06.000 --> 38:09.000]  waiting for the media minions to get back to their typewriters
[38:09.000 --> 38:12.000]  and figure out what they're going to be able to pull from this speech
[38:12.000 --> 38:16.000]  that Donald Trump gave, but also these protesters out there
[38:16.000 --> 38:21.000]  who are they going to be able to finally break out of the cult that they're in
[38:21.000 --> 38:25.000]  and wrap their minds around this very inclusive message.
[38:25.000 --> 38:27.000]  They're out there in the streets saying,
[38:27.000 --> 38:31.000]  power to the people, whose streets are streets, power.
[38:31.000 --> 38:34.000]  And this is exactly what President Trump is saying that he is about
[38:34.000 --> 38:37.000]  and what he wants to usher in to make America great again.
[38:37.000 --> 38:39.000]  It was an inclusive thing.
[38:39.000 --> 38:42.000]  All Americans, regardless of your race, class, creed,
[38:42.000 --> 38:45.000]  we're all Americans and there's no room for prejudice here.
[38:45.000 --> 38:49.000]  And I just wonder if they could even open their minds enough
[38:49.000 --> 38:53.000]  to allow that message to come in or do they truly believe,
[38:53.000 --> 38:56.000]  the big meme going around social media this morning was,
[38:56.000 --> 38:59.000]  don't forget to set your clock back 300 years.
[38:59.000 --> 39:03.000]  No civil rights issues are even on the table here.
[39:03.000 --> 39:05.000]  That's funny.
[39:05.000 --> 39:10.000]  But let's set the clocks back to 40 years ago
[39:10.000 --> 39:14.000]  when we had the radical left that were saying,
[39:14.000 --> 39:16.000]  let's stop the Vietnam War.
[39:16.000 --> 39:17.000]  I agreed with them.
[39:17.000 --> 39:18.000]  I wanted to stop the Vietnam War.
[39:18.000 --> 39:21.000]  It was very clear that we were being played.
[39:21.000 --> 39:25.000]  Fairly early on, we were being played.
[39:25.000 --> 39:27.000]  There was a false flag attack that began that war.
[39:27.000 --> 39:29.000]  It was clear that the American government had no intention
[39:29.000 --> 39:31.000]  of trying to even win that war.
[39:31.000 --> 39:34.000]  They would go in and take over an area and a great loss of American life
[39:34.000 --> 39:36.000]  and then just walk away and leave it open.
[39:36.000 --> 39:37.000]  So it's like, let's stop this.
[39:37.000 --> 39:39.000]  Why are we doing this?
[39:39.000 --> 39:42.000]  And of course, it's being run by people like Robert McNamara.
[39:42.000 --> 39:45.000]  He admitted in a documentary, The Fog of War,
[39:45.000 --> 39:48.000]  he admitted that it was a false flag that began the whole thing,
[39:48.000 --> 39:49.000]  the Gulf of Tonkin.
[39:49.000 --> 39:51.000]  So yeah, we should have stopped that war.
[39:51.000 --> 39:53.000]  We had no business being in that war.
[39:53.000 --> 39:56.000]  We had no business being in the seven wars that we're in now, quite frankly.
[39:56.000 --> 39:58.000]  The ones that Obama opened up.
[39:58.000 --> 40:00.000]  Every year at his presidency.
[40:00.000 --> 40:01.000]  Absolutely.
[40:01.000 --> 40:03.000]  And so why can't we go back to the time?
[40:03.000 --> 40:06.000]  And we played a little bit of a clip there with John Lennon
[40:06.000 --> 40:09.000]  and those who were anti-war protesters saying, let's give peace a chance.
[40:09.000 --> 40:12.000]  Why don't you guys give peace a chance?
[40:12.000 --> 40:14.000]  Why don't you stop trying to push for war with Russia?
[40:14.000 --> 40:16.000]  Why don't you give Donald Trump a chance?
[40:16.000 --> 40:18.000]  See what he's going to do.
[40:18.000 --> 40:22.000]  Maybe, just maybe, you're wrong about all this racism, fascism,
[40:22.000 --> 40:27.000]  xenophobia, anti-woman rhetoric that you've been fed.
[40:27.000 --> 40:28.000]  Maybe you're wrong about that.
[40:28.000 --> 40:29.000]  Just give it a chance.
[40:29.000 --> 40:30.000]  Right.
[40:30.000 --> 40:33.000]  Well, and of course we see, they don't want to give it a chance.
[40:33.000 --> 40:37.000]  And we're seeing how people who are in control of the media, Hollywood,
[40:37.000 --> 40:43.000]  those establishment, they were in collusion with President Obama's America
[40:43.000 --> 40:44.000]  and his government.
[40:44.000 --> 40:49.000]  So now they're giving these, according to members of the Directors Guild of America,
[40:49.000 --> 40:54.000]  they're working on TV coverage of the inauguration and all the related events.
[40:54.000 --> 40:58.000]  They tell TMZ that they're being threatened by someone who has sent word
[40:58.000 --> 41:00.000]  out to everyone in the organization.
[41:00.000 --> 41:05.000]  You do anything Trump related and you're in big trouble.
[41:05.000 --> 41:10.000]  So they're basically threatening him and that the email starts with calling Trump
[41:10.000 --> 41:12.000]  the monster we all fear.
[41:12.000 --> 41:15.000]  It is not an overstatement that he is about to destroy this country
[41:15.000 --> 41:17.000]  if we don't do something about it.
[41:17.000 --> 41:21.000]  There is no need of naming names when the inaugural credits will tell us enough
[41:21.000 --> 41:23.000]  about the people who truly care about this country
[41:23.000 --> 41:25.000]  and those who don't share the same ideals.
[41:25.000 --> 41:27.000]  So basically threatening the Directors Guild of America,
[41:27.000 --> 41:31.000]  don't you dare shine any positive light on this inauguration.
[41:31.000 --> 41:36.000]  It's in stark contrast to what we saw in 2009 with the networks
[41:36.000 --> 41:39.000]  and the media totally slobbering all over President Obama.
[41:39.000 --> 41:44.000]  The sacred event, oh, even the seagulls in the sky must be in awe
[41:44.000 --> 41:46.000]  of this coming together of humanity.
[41:46.000 --> 41:50.000]  It was just this total sycophantic media that we've been experiencing
[41:50.000 --> 41:54.000]  for the last eight years and so it's just very, I think,
[41:54.000 --> 41:58.000]  eye-opening for so many people out there who never were able to see
[41:58.000 --> 42:01.000]  how media controls us and programs us.
[42:01.000 --> 42:05.000]  If there was ever a time for the people to get it, now would be the time.
[42:05.000 --> 42:09.000]  Well, you know, look, I understand that Chris Matthews gets chills
[42:09.000 --> 42:12.000]  up and down his leg when he sees Barack Obama.
[42:12.000 --> 42:16.000]  I understand that he likes, you know, it's fine, just don't tell us that you're objective.
[42:16.000 --> 42:19.000]  We understand and everybody sees your bias now after these last eight years
[42:19.000 --> 42:23.000]  and especially after the selection and so it's fine to have a bias,
[42:23.000 --> 42:26.000]  just own it, tell people where you're coming from
[42:26.000 --> 42:28.000]  and then support why you're coming from that position
[42:28.000 --> 42:30.000]  instead of telling lies about people,
[42:30.000 --> 42:34.000]  instead of telling people that lie to us and telling us that you're objective,
[42:34.000 --> 42:38.000]  that you don't have a point of view and that you're completely...
[42:38.000 --> 42:43.000]  Sorry, I'm waving goodbye to Barack Obama the last time he's using our American tax dollars
[42:43.000 --> 42:46.000]  to take his family on a bajillion dollar trip.
[42:46.000 --> 42:47.000]  Oh, I don't know.
[42:47.000 --> 42:50.000]  I think you'll find a way to somehow live off of the government,
[42:50.000 --> 42:52.000]  off of the public money.
[42:52.000 --> 42:55.000]  This is a guy who was a community organizer before he got into politics
[42:55.000 --> 43:01.000]  and now he's able to afford a $22,000 a month house in Washington, D.C.
[43:01.000 --> 43:04.000]  so he can stay there and can remain involved in politics.
[43:04.000 --> 43:06.000]  And build a wall around his rental.
[43:06.000 --> 43:09.000]  Unfortunately, we've not seen the last of Barack Obama.
[43:09.000 --> 43:12.000]  He's going to remain around and he's going to break precedent
[43:12.000 --> 43:14.000]  as we've never seen before, but that's a good thing
[43:14.000 --> 43:18.000]  because he's going to continue and the Democrat Party's going to continue down the same path.
[43:18.000 --> 43:21.000]  We've seen Nancy Pelosi say, look, we're not going to change.
[43:21.000 --> 43:22.000]  Why would we change?
[43:22.000 --> 43:25.000]  Yeah, you've only lost 1,000 seats in the last eight years,
[43:25.000 --> 43:27.000]  elected office throughout the various states.
[43:27.000 --> 43:29.000]  So why would you change Nancy Pelosi?
[43:29.000 --> 43:33.000]  Please, keep going down the path that you're going and to total irrelevancy
[43:33.000 --> 43:36.000]  because everybody understands where you're coming from, everybody understands
[43:36.000 --> 43:38.000]  where the mainstream media is coming from.
[43:38.000 --> 43:41.000]  We understand your bias and you are not going to be able to play this game anymore
[43:41.000 --> 43:47.000]  that it's true because the New York Times or CNN or ABC NBC CBS says it.
[43:47.000 --> 43:49.000]  It isn't true because they say it.
[43:49.000 --> 43:51.000]  They're going to have to support what they say.
[43:51.000 --> 43:53.000]  We're going to understand that they have a bias
[43:53.000 --> 43:55.000]  and so I think that's a very healthy thing.
[43:55.000 --> 43:57.000]  We can now have that discussion.
[43:57.000 --> 44:00.000]  We're going to see the White House press corps opened up beyond these 49 people
[44:00.000 --> 44:03.000]  who have this little guild going on.
[44:03.000 --> 44:06.000]  That's truly what that is, trying to protect their positions.
[44:06.000 --> 44:09.000]  They're freaking out, calling it censorship.
[44:09.000 --> 44:11.000]  It's absolutely amazing.
[44:11.000 --> 44:14.000]  We've got Darren and Margaret that are ready to join us,
[44:14.000 --> 44:16.000]  comment on what they've just seen.
[44:16.000 --> 44:18.000]  Darren and Margaret, your comments.
[44:18.000 --> 44:21.000]  Well, Darren, I mean, that's got to be the speech of the century.
[44:21.000 --> 44:24.000]  Obviously, teleprompter-free, all heart.
[44:24.000 --> 44:26.000]  And who would have thought it?
[44:26.000 --> 44:28.000]  He honored our military.
[44:28.000 --> 44:31.000]  He talked about putting America first in protectionism.
[44:31.000 --> 44:34.000]  You know, you think that these were kind of basic concepts
[44:34.000 --> 44:37.000]  and yet when you hear them come out of a president's mouth,
[44:37.000 --> 44:39.000]  you really just, it's dumb-founding.
[44:39.000 --> 44:42.000]  It's just, you know, I was tearing up through the whole speech.
[44:42.000 --> 44:44.000]  That was a great speech.
[44:44.000 --> 44:47.000]  A lot of JFK inaugural speech-type moments, you know.
[44:47.000 --> 44:50.000]  So, and by the way, we are editing the highlights of that speech as we speak.
[44:50.000 --> 44:53.000]  So we're going to have those up on in fours real soon.
[44:53.000 --> 44:57.000]  But this is a historic day and this is the battle to save the Republic
[44:57.000 --> 44:59.000]  and defeat the globalist.
[44:59.000 --> 45:02.000]  And there was a lot of globalist type of, that was his message
[45:02.000 --> 45:04.000]  to fight the globalist as well.
[45:04.000 --> 45:07.000]  Historic moment and I thought it was fantastic.
[45:07.000 --> 45:09.000]  This is a day of celebration.
[45:09.000 --> 45:12.000]  Well, speaking of globalist, you know, David, I was looking for Bill and Hillary
[45:12.000 --> 45:16.000]  to see if they were in all purple as you speculated they would be.
[45:16.000 --> 45:19.000]  It looked like Bill Clinton may have had on a purple tie.
[45:19.000 --> 45:21.000]  I think she turned purple there.
[45:21.000 --> 45:23.000]  She saw him being sworn in.
[45:23.000 --> 45:25.000]  I think she didn't need to have purple which she was wearing.
[45:25.000 --> 45:27.000]  She had her face turned purple.
[45:27.000 --> 45:31.000]  And I just love that speech that he was giving with all of those.
[45:31.000 --> 45:35.000]  I mean, it was directed at everyone that was behind him.
[45:35.000 --> 45:36.000]  Absolutely.
[45:36.000 --> 45:39.000]  All the policies you guys put in place, your legacy, it is done.
[45:39.000 --> 45:41.000]  It hasn't been for the people.
[45:41.000 --> 45:44.000]  And then he turns around and Barack Obama is like, good job.
[45:44.000 --> 45:45.000]  It's an excellent speech.
[45:45.000 --> 45:47.000]  I believe it was written by Stephen Miller.
[45:47.000 --> 45:50.000]  And of course, he's written a lot of Trump's stump speeches
[45:50.000 --> 45:53.000]  and was a senior advisor for Senator Sessions
[45:53.000 --> 45:55.000]  and became one of the first supporters of Donald Trump
[45:55.000 --> 45:58.000]  because of the trade and sovereignty issues.
[45:58.000 --> 46:01.000]  That was something he's been hardcore about.
[46:01.000 --> 46:05.000]  And of course, Senator Sessions has never supported a presidential candidate before.
[46:05.000 --> 46:07.000]  That's the first time he ever endorsed anyone.
[46:07.000 --> 46:09.000]  And now he will be the Attorney General.
[46:09.000 --> 46:12.000]  I don't think the confirmation has gone through, but I think it will go through.
[46:12.000 --> 46:14.000]  I don't think they've done a vote on it because, of course,
[46:14.000 --> 46:16.000]  the Democrats have been dragging their feet on it.
[46:16.000 --> 46:19.000]  And that was part of this designated survivor thing.
[46:19.000 --> 46:23.000]  It's like, hey, you know, you don't have any cabinet picks thanks to us.
[46:23.000 --> 46:25.000]  We kind of drug our feet on this.
[46:25.000 --> 46:29.000]  We'll leave you with Jay Johnson if a tragedy strikes.
[46:29.000 --> 46:31.000]  Possibly the most historic moment.
[46:31.000 --> 46:35.000]  I mean, probably in my lifetime, but if you looked on the cover of CNN last night,
[46:35.000 --> 46:40.000]  they were featuring El Chapo and trying to dirty up a pastor
[46:40.000 --> 46:42.000]  that had prayed over Donald Trump.
[46:42.000 --> 46:45.000]  I mean, it was just like, how could you miss the boat so much so?
[46:45.000 --> 46:48.000]  The big message on the mainstream news media right now
[46:48.000 --> 46:51.000]  is the most unpopular president in history, you know?
[46:51.000 --> 46:53.000]  According to what polls?
[46:53.000 --> 46:56.000]  Exactly. Just like the polls that said Hillary was going to win, right?
[46:56.000 --> 46:58.000]  The day of the election, 80% chance, right?
[46:58.000 --> 46:59.000]  Correct.
[46:59.000 --> 47:03.000]  During the speech today, Donald Trump said when America is united,
[47:03.000 --> 47:05.000]  America is unstoppable.
[47:05.000 --> 47:09.000]  The mainstream media is trying to tell us that we are divided.
[47:09.000 --> 47:12.000]  We're more divided now than since the Civil War.
[47:12.000 --> 47:15.000]  And there's going to be another Civil War waiting around every corner.
[47:15.000 --> 47:17.000]  We're about to go into Civil War.
[47:17.000 --> 47:19.000]  I think we are united now more than ever.
[47:19.000 --> 47:22.000]  I think patriotism is making a huge comeback.
[47:22.000 --> 47:26.000]  And I think that everyone is very extremely optimistic about the future,
[47:26.000 --> 47:28.000]  apart from the left, of course.
[47:28.000 --> 47:30.000]  They're always butthurt and they're always going to have problems.
[47:30.000 --> 47:33.000]  But I'm very optimistic about the future.
[47:33.000 --> 47:36.000]  This is a historic moment and I can't wait to see what's next.
[47:36.000 --> 47:38.000]  No kidding. Well, you mentioned the left.
[47:38.000 --> 47:41.000]  You know, I'm of the belief that the cycle of the lies,
[47:41.000 --> 47:44.000]  I mean, we've seen a dissipation happen in the atmosphere
[47:44.000 --> 47:46.000]  where we were able to break through some of those.
[47:46.000 --> 47:49.000]  And our focus should be now to pull those people over.
[47:49.000 --> 47:51.000]  But they're doing it for us.
[47:51.000 --> 47:54.000]  The more they act like fools, the more they protest, burn down their own cities,
[47:54.000 --> 47:59.000]  the more 60-plus Democrats refuse to go to this peaceful transfer of power.
[47:59.000 --> 48:03.000]  And then they sit out and they boycott Trump's inauguration.
[48:03.000 --> 48:04.000]  That just helps us.
[48:04.000 --> 48:06.000]  That's a turnoff to a lot of people.
[48:06.000 --> 48:09.000]  They think they look silly. They're unpatriotic.
[48:09.000 --> 48:11.000]  And it's really disrespectful.
[48:11.000 --> 48:14.000]  And what it's doing, it's getting recruits on our side.
[48:14.000 --> 48:16.000]  That's what they're doing in the process.
[48:16.000 --> 48:18.000]  That's how they lost the election to begin with
[48:18.000 --> 48:20.000]  and they haven't learned from their mistakes.
[48:20.000 --> 48:23.000]  Right. You're talking about also, I wanted to mention this one lady's tweet
[48:23.000 --> 48:25.000]  about the black community.
[48:25.000 --> 48:28.000]  She was an Iraq war veteran and she was talking about Barack Obama
[48:28.000 --> 48:33.000]  and Congressman Lewis because, you know, we've seen a lot from Congressman Lewis
[48:33.000 --> 48:35.000]  boycotting the inauguration.
[48:35.000 --> 48:38.000]  And she said, look, you know, President Obama and Congressman Lewis,
[48:38.000 --> 48:40.000]  they've been in power a very long time.
[48:40.000 --> 48:43.000]  What have they done for the black communities of America?
[48:43.000 --> 48:47.000]  They've remained poor and crime-ridden and a lot of destruction and hopelessness.
[48:47.000 --> 48:51.000]  Well, these two men have gotten wealthier and wealthier and wealthier.
[48:51.000 --> 48:52.000]  It's just empty rhetoric.
[48:52.000 --> 48:55.000]  John Lewis' district is a total disaster,
[48:55.000 --> 48:58.000]  just like every other Democratic-controlled district
[48:58.000 --> 49:00.000]  and congressional districts across the country.
[49:00.000 --> 49:01.000]  Total disasters.
[49:01.000 --> 49:04.000]  They're inner-city ghetto zones.
[49:04.000 --> 49:05.000]  They're crime-ridden.
[49:05.000 --> 49:08.000]  Highest crime rates, the strictest gun control laws.
[49:08.000 --> 49:12.000]  And the black ownership of homes and businesses are rock bottom.
[49:12.000 --> 49:14.000]  So it's a complete disaster.
[49:14.000 --> 49:19.000]  And then he says that he's boycotting the inauguration,
[49:19.000 --> 49:24.000]  John Lewis, right, out of, on behalf of black people.
[49:24.000 --> 49:26.000]  He doesn't speak for all black people.
[49:26.000 --> 49:27.000]  No, he does not.
[49:27.000 --> 49:29.000]  I've counted his paycheck all those years.
[49:29.000 --> 49:32.000]  Yeah, I mean, you know, he doesn't speak for the black people that in my life,
[49:32.000 --> 49:34.000]  my friends and family or the people that I've met on the street
[49:34.000 --> 49:36.000]  who've said they were voting for Trump.
[49:36.000 --> 49:38.000]  He doesn't speak for all black people.
[49:38.000 --> 49:39.000]  That's right.
[49:39.000 --> 49:40.000]  That's right.
[49:40.000 --> 49:41.000]  And mentioning giving Trump a chance, you know,
[49:41.000 --> 49:43.000]  the inner cities especially,
[49:43.000 --> 49:48.000]  they need somebody on their side, a hero, if you will, to bring jobs back.
[49:48.000 --> 49:49.000]  Trump hit it on the head.
[49:49.000 --> 49:52.000]  A nation exists to serve its citizens.
[49:52.000 --> 49:55.000]  And these are just unreasonable demands of a righteous people.
[49:55.000 --> 49:57.000]  You know, imagine that, Darren.
[49:57.000 --> 50:00.000]  You know, a nation exists to serve its citizens.
[50:00.000 --> 50:01.000]  Who would have thought?
[50:01.000 --> 50:02.000]  Revolutionary concept.
[50:02.000 --> 50:03.000]  Okay, imagine this.
[50:03.000 --> 50:10.000]  Imagine 60-plus Republicans boycotting Obama's inauguration.
[50:10.000 --> 50:12.000]  I mean, it would be the end of the world.
[50:12.000 --> 50:13.000]  Right.
[50:13.000 --> 50:14.000]  Right.
[50:14.000 --> 50:16.000]  I'm just relieved that I didn't have to hear Beyoncé lip-sync today.
[50:16.000 --> 50:19.000]  You know, honestly, you know, in other news and other...
[50:19.000 --> 50:21.000]  I thought the singer was really lovely.
[50:21.000 --> 50:22.000]  She had a wonderful...
[50:22.000 --> 50:24.000]  She clearly wasn't lip-syncing anything up there.
[50:24.000 --> 50:25.000]  And you could hear...
[50:25.000 --> 50:29.000]  I can only imagine the pressure that that would have put on a young woman.
[50:29.000 --> 50:30.000]  And her name escapes.
[50:30.000 --> 50:32.000]  We were just watching this before you guys came to us.
[50:32.000 --> 50:34.000]  Well, the party's just begun.
[50:34.000 --> 50:35.000]  And it will be going on all night.
[50:35.000 --> 50:36.000]  And I believe...
[50:36.000 --> 50:37.000]  Are we going to go on to what?
[50:37.000 --> 50:38.000]  Midnight tonight?
[50:38.000 --> 50:39.000]  We're doing like 14-hour shoot?
[50:39.000 --> 50:40.000]  That's right.
[50:40.000 --> 50:42.000]  I don't want to go go, come on, come on.
[50:42.000 --> 50:49.000]  One of the things that we're going to be following is to see if there are going to be some counter-executive orders put out by Donald Trump.
[50:49.000 --> 50:50.000]  Hitting the ground running.
[50:50.000 --> 50:52.000]  We've had some indications that that's going to be happening.
[50:52.000 --> 51:02.000]  And of course, what the two of you, Darren and Margaret, alluded to, the fact that people in Congressman Lewis' district as well as others,
[51:02.000 --> 51:03.000]  Donald Trump addressed that.
[51:03.000 --> 51:06.000]  He said, their victories have not been your victories.
[51:06.000 --> 51:08.000]  Their triumphs have not been your triumphs.
[51:08.000 --> 51:10.000]  We're going to change that right here and right now.
[51:10.000 --> 51:11.000]  Stay with us.
[51:11.000 --> 51:15.000]  We're going to be right back with more live coverage of Donald Trump's inauguration.
[51:15.000 --> 51:41.000]  Donald Trump, now President of the United States.
[51:41.000 --> 52:03.000]  What's it going to take?
[52:03.000 --> 52:04.000]  Another news story.
[52:04.000 --> 52:07.000]  You've heard about Infidel Body Armor for years.
[52:07.000 --> 52:09.000]  You know you should have a set.
[52:09.000 --> 52:11.000]  So should your wife.
[52:11.000 --> 52:12.000]  Things aren't getting better.
[52:12.000 --> 52:13.000]  They're getting worse.

[53:01.000 --> 53:03.000]  We need a thousand Paul Revere's.
[53:03.000 --> 53:09.000]  When I was a boy, it was okay to be proud of the flag, heritage, mom and apple pie.
[53:09.000 --> 53:12.000]  And beef was for supper.
[53:12.000 --> 53:16.000]  Revelation, dawn of global government, theatrical screenings on demand.

[54:44.000 --> 54:45.000]  Welcome back to The Alex Jones Show.
[54:45.000 --> 54:48.000]  I'm David Knight with Leanne McAdoo here in Austin,
[54:48.000 --> 54:51.000]  and we have in our other studio, Darren McBrain and Margaret Howell.
[54:51.000 --> 54:56.000]  We have just witnessed the inauguration, the swearing-in ceremony of Donald J. Trump
[54:56.000 --> 54:58.000]  as a 45th President of the United States.
[54:58.000 --> 55:01.000]  It was a great speech. We've been talking about what he had to say.
[55:01.000 --> 55:05.000]  We're going to have some clips of that coming up for you, some replays of that as well.
[55:05.000 --> 55:08.000]  Before we go back to Darren and Margaret in the other studio,
[55:08.000 --> 55:12.000]  I just want to remind you that we also have crew in Washington, D.C.,
[55:12.000 --> 55:19.000]  and we'll be going to them shortly, as well as Alex Jones will be giving us broadcasts and reports from Washington, D.C.
[55:19.000 --> 55:25.000]  One of the ways that you can help to support InfoWars and to help us to get the word out
[55:25.000 --> 55:30.000]  as we are in Washington, D.C., is to buy what we sell at infowars.com,
[55:30.000 --> 55:34.000]  things that we have put on sale, things that we have created to support you and your health.
[55:34.000 --> 55:41.000]  Now, of course, the beginning of the year, we came up with a sale for most of our most popular products.
[55:41.000 --> 55:45.000]  We have SuperMail Vitality, BrainForce Plus, both of those 30% off,
[55:45.000 --> 55:47.000]  along with Survival Shield X2, nascent iodine.
[55:47.000 --> 55:54.000]  We also have 20% off Secret 12, our vitamin B12 formulation, and knockouts, our natural sleep formula.
[55:54.000 --> 55:57.000]  We have many other items that are available at infowarslife.com.
[55:57.000 --> 56:02.000]  That sale that we began at the beginning of the year is about to end with the inauguration,
[56:02.000 --> 56:06.000]  but we also added as an inauguration special, and I'm not sure how long this is going to run either.
[56:06.000 --> 56:10.000]  We have InfoWars Select Storable Food, 30 to 40% off.
[56:10.000 --> 56:16.000]  A great time for you to stock up on food, as we saw with the storms running through this last week.
[56:16.000 --> 56:24.000]  The shelves emptied with people running down the grocery store and stocking up on supplies as snow and ice were coming in.
[56:24.000 --> 56:29.000]  Even that kind of a minor natural disaster can empty the shelves.
[56:29.000 --> 56:33.000]  So make sure that you are prepared with your family so that you're not susceptible to that,
[56:33.000 --> 56:36.000]  so that you're not susceptible to price increases.
[56:36.000 --> 56:39.000]  Now is the time to get it while it's 30 to 40% off.
[56:39.000 --> 56:42.000]  This lasts for 25 years, all made in America.
[56:42.000 --> 56:49.000]  Great quality food, no GMO, it is resealable once you open it, and again, it has a 25-year shelf life.
[56:49.000 --> 56:58.000]  That's one way to not only provide for shortages, but to also smooth out the bumps in the road that go along with price increases.
[56:58.000 --> 57:00.000]  And that supports InfoWars at the same time.
[57:00.000 --> 57:05.000]  Again, look at the specials we have at infowarsstore.com and infowarslife.com.
[57:05.000 --> 57:16.000]  Now we have some reports, of course, we've got an article here from Paul Joseph Watson, anti-Trump protesters are building walls to stop Trump protesters from even getting into the inauguration.
[57:16.000 --> 57:20.000]  That's a great way to put it as Watson points out, but I thought they were against walls.
[57:20.000 --> 57:22.000]  I thought walls were racist.
[57:22.000 --> 57:24.000]  Your comments, Darren.
[57:24.000 --> 57:33.000]  Oh, exactly. I was just thinking about the 60-plus Democrats that are boycotting the inauguration, so they're not in Washington, D.C. today.
[57:33.000 --> 57:35.000]  I'd say we're off to a good start.
[57:35.000 --> 57:37.000]  Already draining this?
[57:37.000 --> 57:43.000]  Well, you know, Trump really smacked them down, I think, in a sense with that inclusive speech that he said.
[57:43.000 --> 57:48.000]  He said, this is not about transferring power from one person to another, or from one party to another.
[57:48.000 --> 57:53.000]  You partisan hacks who don't even want to show up for the peaceful transition of power.
[57:53.000 --> 57:56.000]  This is about transferring power back to the people.
[57:56.000 --> 57:58.000]  That was a great point that he made.
[57:58.000 --> 58:04.000]  The fact that they've come out and say that they're going to stall at every opportunity, they're going to block and stall.
[58:04.000 --> 58:11.000]  So they're basically just letting their constituents know that they're not going to be working on their behalf, they're not going to be doing anything.
[58:11.000 --> 58:14.000]  They're just going to be there to hold things up and collect a paycheck.
[58:14.000 --> 58:23.000]  And this is why Donald Trump, this is why people resonated with his message and wanted him in there because he's saying those type of people are out.
[58:23.000 --> 58:25.000]  I've got a prediction too.
[58:25.000 --> 58:27.000]  Get those people out with our next election. Yes, sir.
[58:27.000 --> 58:31.000]  I say that Donald Trump will take less vacations than any president in history.
[58:31.000 --> 58:39.000]  Right. I agree. I was thinking about that when he was there walking off with Barack Obama and Obama was boarding the plane for the last time.
[58:39.000 --> 58:48.000]  Just thinking how many times Barack Obama went to go play golf or, you know, when things just got a little too tough, he would hit the green and I just do.
[58:48.000 --> 58:51.000]  Donald Trump is obsessed with working.
[58:51.000 --> 58:52.000]  Absolutely.
[58:52.000 --> 58:53.000]  We're going to be back.
[58:53.000 --> 58:57.000]  I'm David Knight with Leanne McAdoo, Darren McBrain, Margaret Howell here in Austin.
[58:57.000 --> 59:06.000]  We're going to be joined by our crew in Washington, D.C. and we're going to have highlights of Donald Trump's swearing in with us right after the break. Stay with us.
[59:06.000 --> 59:20.000]  You are listening to GCN. Visit GCNLive.com today.
[59:20.000 --> 59:28.000]  I am very proud to announce the introduction of the highest quality info wars, biome defense probiotic.
[59:28.000 --> 59:42.000]  We wanted to come out with the largest spectrum of high quality known probiotics that have been proven to improve overall digestion and health and detoxification in the body.

[1:00:16.000 --> 1:00:23.000]  Support your own health and support the info war.
[1:00:23.000 --> 1:00:32.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:00:32.000 --> 1:00:55.000]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[1:00:55.000 --> 1:01:22.000]  Please raise your right hand and repeat after me. I, Donald John Trump, do solemnly swear that I will faithfully execute the office of President of the United States and will to the best of my ability,
[1:01:22.000 --> 1:01:31.000]  preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States.
[1:01:31.000 --> 1:01:33.000]  So help me God.
[1:01:33.000 --> 1:01:57.000]  Congratulations Mr. President.
[1:01:57.000 --> 1:02:25.000]  Congratulations Mr. President.
[1:02:25.000 --> 1:02:44.000]  Congratulations Mr. President.
[1:02:44.000 --> 1:03:01.000]  What a great honor to be able to introduce for the first time ever anywhere the 45th President of the United States of America, Donald J. Trump.
[1:03:01.000 --> 1:03:20.000]  Did I get that one right?
[1:03:20.000 --> 1:03:41.000]  Chief Justice Roberts, President Carter, President Clinton, President Bush, President Obama, fellow Americans and people of the world, thank you.
[1:03:41.000 --> 1:03:57.000]  We, the citizens of America, are now joined in a great national effort to rebuild our country and restore its promise for all of our people.
[1:03:57.000 --> 1:04:06.000]  Together we will determine the course of America and the world for many, many years to come.
[1:04:06.000 --> 1:04:14.000]  We will face challenges, we will confront hardships, but we will get the job done.
[1:04:14.000 --> 1:04:21.000]  Every four years we gather on these steps to carry out the orderly and peaceful transfer of power.
[1:04:21.000 --> 1:04:33.000]  And we are grateful to President Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama for their gracious aid throughout this transition.
[1:04:33.000 --> 1:04:43.000]  You have been magnificent. Thank you.
[1:04:43.000 --> 1:04:58.000]  Today's ceremony, however, has very special meaning because today we are not merely transferring power from one administration to another or from one party to another,
[1:04:58.000 --> 1:05:13.000]  we are transferring power from Washington, D.C. and giving it back to you, the people.
[1:05:30.000 --> 1:05:35.000]  Migrants are racing for the U.S. border right before Trump is taking office.
[1:05:35.000 --> 1:05:44.000]  There's an article that's up on the Drudge Report that talks about how illegals are coming for the U.S. border in lieu of a Trump victory he's taking office tomorrow, folks.
[1:05:44.000 --> 1:05:50.000]  Migrants that are trying to sneak into the U.S. on the last day of what they see because they realize that a wall is in fact coming.
[1:05:50.000 --> 1:05:58.000]  These challenges are nothing compared to a bigger fear they have that someday soon U.S. President-elect Donald Trump will build that wall and keep them out altogether.
[1:05:58.000 --> 1:06:05.000]  So before Trump takes office tomorrow, they're racing against time, riding a freight train up to the border to look for a way across.
[1:06:05.000 --> 1:06:11.000]  In the town, near a frontier group of Hondurans warn themselves near a fire, a trash in the early morning cold.
[1:06:11.000 --> 1:06:18.000]  There's an article that YouTube has put up showing these migrants ready to jump the train and the event that it slows down.
[1:06:18.000 --> 1:06:25.000]  Got news for you, folks. That wall is coming, but it looks like migrants are feeling the burn, literally, and racing for the border.
[1:06:25.000 --> 1:06:49.000]  I'm Margaret Howe reporting for Infowars.com.

[1:09:14.000 --> 1:09:19.000]  So while with her, you probably read it. It was a drudge. Who's great, by the way? Drudge is amazing.
[1:09:19.000 --> 1:09:23.000]  But the story in drudge, and big story, it's all over the place now.
[1:09:23.000 --> 1:09:27.000]  Guys swimming across, and big bags of stuff.
[1:09:27.000 --> 1:09:32.000]  Strugs swimming across the river, right?
[1:09:32.000 --> 1:09:33.000]  Swimming right across.
[1:09:33.000 --> 1:09:38.000]  We just caught these guys coming across the border. They're jumping in. They just jumped in the rafts.
[1:09:38.000 --> 1:09:43.000]  They're coming up one, two, three, four. They have big satchels.
[1:09:43.000 --> 1:09:49.000]  And actually, the camera crew, or the reporters, were petrified because they thought they were going to be killed.
[1:09:49.000 --> 1:09:53.000]  Because they're showing this on camera. The guys carrying bags of stuff, it was drugs.
[1:10:00.000 --> 1:10:04.000]  Donald Trump, I hope you can help uncriple America. Thank you so much, sir.
[1:10:04.000 --> 1:10:06.000]  You will be attacked for coming on, and we know you know that. Thank you.
[1:10:06.000 --> 1:10:08.000]  Thank you very much.
[1:10:08.000 --> 1:10:13.000]  Rallying Patriots Worldwide in Defense of Human Liberty.
[1:10:13.000 --> 1:10:16.000]  It's Alex Jones.
[1:10:23.000 --> 1:10:29.000]  Before America can be great again, she must be free again.
[1:10:29.000 --> 1:10:33.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[1:10:33.000 --> 1:10:37.000]  And as you heard, ruffles and flourishes, and hail to the Chief.
[1:10:37.000 --> 1:10:40.000]  Donald Trump is now the 45th President of the United States.
[1:10:40.000 --> 1:10:43.000]  He was sworn in at noon Eastern time.
[1:10:43.000 --> 1:10:47.000]  We just played a re-clip of that swearing-in process at the beginning of the hour.
[1:10:47.000 --> 1:10:52.000]  We're going to go to our reporters, well, first to Alex Jones in Washington, D.C.
[1:10:52.000 --> 1:10:58.000]  Before we go to Alex, I just want to remind you that we have a President Trump 16x20 lithograph.
[1:10:58.000 --> 1:11:03.000]  1995, you'll see that it's a limited edition at InfoWarsStore.com.
[1:11:03.000 --> 1:11:05.000]  It is exclusive to InfoWars.
[1:11:05.000 --> 1:11:08.000]  This is done by the official RNC Portrait Artist.
[1:11:08.000 --> 1:11:12.000]  And I can tell you, it is very detailed, a great-looking poster.
[1:11:12.000 --> 1:11:15.000]  I've seen the one that we have framed here in the hallway.
[1:11:15.000 --> 1:11:17.000]  That is a great-looking poster.
[1:11:17.000 --> 1:11:23.000]  And again, it's 1995, 16x20, limited edition, exclusive to InfoWars.
[1:11:23.000 --> 1:11:28.000]  And joining us now is Alex Jones from Washington, D.C. Alex.
[1:11:28.000 --> 1:11:31.000]  Well, thank you, David. Yes, it's an amazing print.
[1:11:31.000 --> 1:11:34.000]  I'm shocked that the guy's a listener, a big fan, and very famous.
[1:11:34.000 --> 1:11:37.000]  He's the official, you know, guy that does it for the Republican Party.
[1:11:37.000 --> 1:11:39.000]  And of course, the famous drawing of Ronald Reagan with the cowboy hat.
[1:11:39.000 --> 1:11:41.000]  That's him, but that's a side issue.
[1:11:41.000 --> 1:11:44.000]  I'm just going to take over here for about 10 minutes and hand up a tom back to you guys.
[1:11:44.000 --> 1:11:48.000]  And I'm going to come in later in the 14-hour marathon broadcast with you guys.
[1:11:48.000 --> 1:11:52.000]  First off, let me just take a deep breath here.
[1:11:52.000 --> 1:11:54.000]  Break down what just happened here today.
[1:11:54.000 --> 1:11:57.000]  Undoubtedly, this was Providence.
[1:11:57.000 --> 1:12:00.000]  This was American destiny being invoked.
[1:12:00.000 --> 1:12:05.000]  This was Trump declaring the birthright of this republic that George Washington talked about.
[1:12:05.000 --> 1:12:10.000]  And that Providence started back in 1776.
[1:12:10.000 --> 1:12:12.000]  He invoked it. It was so historical.
[1:12:12.000 --> 1:12:14.000]  And I knew they were going to invoke it.
[1:12:14.000 --> 1:12:16.000]  It just came into my mind.
[1:12:16.000 --> 1:12:20.000]  And I knew, even though he hasn't given the speech, and I haven't talked to Trump about this,
[1:12:20.000 --> 1:12:22.000]  I knew what was about to happen.
[1:12:22.000 --> 1:12:28.000]  And I said, I've got a tweet that they're going to re-invoke the birthright.
[1:12:28.000 --> 1:12:31.000]  I can just feel it, because that's really what this is.
[1:12:31.000 --> 1:12:34.000]  And then the media was asking me, even the New York Times had seen the tweet.
[1:12:34.000 --> 1:12:35.000]  They said, did you talk to Trump?
[1:12:35.000 --> 1:12:37.000]  And how did you know it wasn't a speech somebody else did?
[1:12:37.000 --> 1:12:39.000]  And I said, no, this is Americana.
[1:12:39.000 --> 1:12:42.000]  Do you understand? We're reading the same book. It's the same spirit.
[1:12:42.000 --> 1:12:45.000]  So I will tell them when I talk about what Trump, the spirit of America.
[1:12:45.000 --> 1:12:47.000]  Can you feel it rising?
[1:12:47.000 --> 1:12:49.000]  Trump feels it. He knows it. He loves it.
[1:12:49.000 --> 1:12:56.000]  He wants to serve the people and empower the people to have America be incredibly wealthy again and empower the globe.
[1:12:56.000 --> 1:12:59.000]  Back when we had 50% of the world's wealth just 30 years ago,
[1:12:59.000 --> 1:13:02.000]  we were sending more money to countries than we are now in more industry.
[1:13:02.000 --> 1:13:09.000]  Now all we send is corporate, monopolies, they do not want us to be prosperous.
[1:13:09.000 --> 1:13:15.000]  And so the message we heard in the speech has been my message for over a decade.
[1:13:15.000 --> 1:13:19.000]  I mean, longer than that, but this is Americanism versus globalism.
[1:13:19.000 --> 1:13:22.000]  So Trump isn't reading from my sheet of music.
[1:13:22.000 --> 1:13:24.000]  It's the sheet of music that's reality.
[1:13:24.000 --> 1:13:26.000]  And that's why it's so similar.
[1:13:26.000 --> 1:13:28.000]  When I say on the show, don't you hear Trump say later?
[1:13:28.000 --> 1:13:30.000]  Okay. And yes, Trump, I was going to listen to the show.
[1:13:30.000 --> 1:13:33.000]  He told me, I'll let you move past all that.
[1:13:33.000 --> 1:13:37.000]  What really matters here is that the people are so awake.
[1:13:37.000 --> 1:13:41.000]  I mean, I'm not kidding. Every second person I walk by is a listener.
[1:13:41.000 --> 1:13:43.000]  I mean, it is blowing my mind. You've seen the live feeds.
[1:13:43.000 --> 1:13:46.000]  The amount of young people, the amount of teenagers are listeners.
[1:13:46.000 --> 1:13:52.000]  This is indicative of a huge, incredible awakening that is happening on a planetary scale, not just here.
[1:13:52.000 --> 1:13:54.000]  So make no mistake.
[1:13:54.000 --> 1:14:01.000]  This revolution against globalism, this revolution against globalism is something that belongs to the people.
[1:14:01.000 --> 1:14:04.000]  And Trump said that this revolution is about you.
[1:14:04.000 --> 1:14:07.000]  You are what empowers it. You are the future.
[1:14:07.000 --> 1:14:13.000]  And we're going to get out of your way and let you have your destiny, have your dreams.
[1:14:13.000 --> 1:14:18.000]  And we understand America's special in that destiny and that as America goes, the rest of the world goes.
[1:14:18.000 --> 1:14:22.000]  Washington envisioned all of this in his farewell address.
[1:14:22.000 --> 1:14:25.000]  He solved this in Providence, in a vision.
[1:14:25.000 --> 1:14:27.000]  And now it's all come true.
[1:14:27.000 --> 1:14:30.000]  The enemy knew that. That's why they always evoke the occult.
[1:14:30.000 --> 1:14:33.000]  Evoke. Don't talk about God or Christ. Don't talk about Providence.
[1:14:33.000 --> 1:14:38.000]  Don't say America's great and all this stuff to demoralize us, not to have this birthright.
[1:14:38.000 --> 1:14:46.000]  It's why they teach you in school how horrible the idea of American Providence and Anifest destiny and all of this is.
[1:14:46.000 --> 1:14:48.000]  And talk about the problems and crimes associated.
[1:14:48.000 --> 1:14:51.000]  There's problems and crimes associated with any humans or any movement.
[1:14:51.000 --> 1:14:57.000]  But overall, the greater destiny to defeat tyranny worldwide and to stop a great evil in the future.
[1:14:57.000 --> 1:15:06.000]  I believe it's going to be this republic in the future that defeats the entire world government, anti-human, eugenics-based, technocracy system.
[1:15:06.000 --> 1:15:10.000]  So we're here. This is a giant victory for humanity.
[1:15:10.000 --> 1:15:17.000]  It is massive and looking at Michelle and looking at Obama up on the Jumbotron.
[1:15:17.000 --> 1:15:28.000]  When they were singing the Tarspanel Banner, Obama, with that arrogant smug feeling that he's better than everybody, looked like he was dying.
[1:15:28.000 --> 1:15:34.000]  Because these are cult members who were put in power by the globalists so that they could help destroy the country and divide the nation.
[1:15:34.000 --> 1:15:38.000]  They are absolutely evil and want poor people not to have a future.
[1:15:38.000 --> 1:15:42.000]  That's why he goes to Africa and says, you can't have cars or air conditioning.
[1:15:42.000 --> 1:15:49.000]  Because he is literally there to hurt poor people across the board and they needed that face, though, as their cover to carry it out.
[1:15:49.000 --> 1:16:01.000]  Donald Trump right now is making hundreds of phone calls a day trying to get jobs into Detroit, trying to get jobs into Atlanta, trying to get jobs into all these places in the Midwest as well.
[1:16:01.000 --> 1:16:04.000]  Very, very, very exciting stuff is happening.
[1:16:04.000 --> 1:16:06.000]  This is just an incredible time to be alive.
[1:16:06.000 --> 1:16:14.000]  And I cannot, I cannot stress to everybody how historical this is because everything the New World Order has done has been designed to bring this country down.
[1:16:14.000 --> 1:16:25.000]  Because they can't have a big free, open, wealthy nation state with a big fat middle class, upwardly mobile people inside this impoverished, anti-human world government system they're establishing.
[1:16:25.000 --> 1:16:28.000]  The American system is too much competition for them.
[1:16:28.000 --> 1:16:30.000]  They admit that in the white papers.
[1:16:30.000 --> 1:16:34.000]  The British government 200 years ago wrote they come to be the American system.
[1:16:34.000 --> 1:16:37.000]  And again, the British now are throwing off globalism.
[1:16:37.000 --> 1:16:39.000]  They're throwing off these monopoly systems.
[1:16:39.000 --> 1:16:42.000]  So this is an incredible time to be alive.
[1:16:42.000 --> 1:16:46.000]  It is an amazing time to be alive and it is quite frankly so humbling and stunning.
[1:16:46.000 --> 1:16:53.000]  The fact that we go through these crowds of people, people of every race, color, and creed are all just humans with red blood.
[1:16:53.000 --> 1:17:03.000]  This is breaking the will of the media that's trying to create racial division and trying to say that if you're not a white person, you can't have guns or private property or a future.
[1:17:03.000 --> 1:17:05.000]  You don't have the American birthright.
[1:17:05.000 --> 1:17:08.000]  You don't have a future of wealth.
[1:17:08.000 --> 1:17:09.000]  That's your enemy. That's racist.
[1:17:09.000 --> 1:17:17.000]  This is a cult programing to make people poor and make them the slaves of the globalists who all over the world will play different groups up against each other.
[1:17:17.000 --> 1:17:20.000]  Which Ukraine will play Catholic off against Orthodox.
[1:17:20.000 --> 1:17:22.000]  Or it's a country in Africa.
[1:17:22.000 --> 1:17:26.000]  They'll play the Christians off against the, you know, the animus of the Muslims or vice versa.
[1:17:26.000 --> 1:17:32.000]  It's all divide and conquer because the elite are destroying nations trying to make us poor.
[1:17:32.000 --> 1:17:36.000]  So America died basically in the last few years.
[1:17:36.000 --> 1:17:38.000]  It was a globalist program.
[1:17:38.000 --> 1:17:42.000]  Bush's and Clinton's behind it with criminal elements of the intelligence agencies.
[1:17:42.000 --> 1:17:45.000]  But America isn't just a person.
[1:17:45.000 --> 1:17:48.000]  I'm sure a person doesn't get resurrected unless it's Jesus or Lazarus.
[1:17:48.000 --> 1:17:56.000]  But a country can come back from the dead and America began to come back from the dead in the last few months.
[1:17:56.000 --> 1:18:02.000]  And now has come back to life. The phoenix is coming up right now.
[1:18:02.000 --> 1:18:07.000]  And how powerful that phoenix is, how incredible that destiny is, is up to us.
[1:18:07.000 --> 1:18:11.000]  We are what brings life into the spirit, it into us.
[1:18:11.000 --> 1:18:13.000]  And the enemy knows everything's energy.
[1:18:13.000 --> 1:18:18.000]  You see, forget all the religious books and all the stuff you can hear from the preachers who are there to control the paradigm.
[1:18:18.000 --> 1:18:24.000]  They, the enemy wants to destroy our spirit, make us feel weak so we don't take our birthright destiny.
[1:18:24.000 --> 1:18:27.000]  We're taking the destiny in our hands.
[1:18:27.000 --> 1:18:29.000]  We're breathing life into it.
[1:18:29.000 --> 1:18:31.000]  And those devil worshipers up there, the enemy.
[1:18:31.000 --> 1:18:33.000]  Chuck E. Schumer, devil worshiper.
[1:18:33.000 --> 1:18:35.000]  Obama, devil worshiper.
[1:18:35.000 --> 1:18:37.000]  It's well known. These are devil worshippers.
[1:18:37.000 --> 1:18:39.000]  What's a devil worshiper?
[1:18:39.000 --> 1:18:41.000]  They want to hurt other people. They want to be number one.
[1:18:41.000 --> 1:18:43.000]  They don't like seeing somebody succeed.
[1:18:43.000 --> 1:18:45.000]  Okay. What somebody that wants prosperity and renaissance?
[1:18:45.000 --> 1:18:47.000]  They want wealth, cornucopia.
[1:18:47.000 --> 1:18:50.000]  They're not jealous of somebody who's got a big house or a good look at life or vice versa.
[1:18:50.000 --> 1:18:53.000]  As long as you don't take something from me, I think your success is great.
[1:18:53.000 --> 1:18:55.000]  These people are devil worshippers.
[1:18:55.000 --> 1:19:01.000]  And what happened today was the chief executive invited God back in and said,
[1:19:01.000 --> 1:19:05.000]  the door is open and instead of the people, the door is open now to you.
[1:19:05.000 --> 1:19:09.000]  If you want this birthright, if you want goodness, we've all got to be good.
[1:19:09.000 --> 1:19:13.000]  We've got to come together and we've got to, your black heart, white people,
[1:19:13.000 --> 1:19:15.000]  white heart, whatever.
[1:19:15.000 --> 1:19:19.000]  We've got to come together about issues that we stand for and what we believe in
[1:19:19.000 --> 1:19:21.000]  and transcend all the control.
[1:19:21.000 --> 1:19:24.000]  The media pushed way too hard with all the race garbage.
[1:19:24.000 --> 1:19:26.000]  Now they're saying he's a Russian spy.
[1:19:26.000 --> 1:19:28.000]  Now they're saying they've got communiques with him and the Russians.
[1:19:28.000 --> 1:19:32.000]  And literally now, he tells, it's not just Maxine Waters.
[1:19:32.000 --> 1:19:36.000]  It's the New York Times now says that Putin actually told him Hillary was crooked.
[1:19:36.000 --> 1:19:40.000]  That's right, America. You can't have your own ideas. You can't have a strong leader.
[1:19:40.000 --> 1:19:44.000]  The Russians are the reason Trump got elected and everything comes from the Russians.
[1:19:44.000 --> 1:19:47.000]  Everybody knows that's BS. Nothing against the Russians, but we,
[1:19:47.000 --> 1:19:51.000]  American events, a lot of stuff too. We come up with a lot of stuff.
[1:19:51.000 --> 1:19:55.000]  Yeah, I mean, give me a break. You don't think we can't come up with crooked Hillary?
[1:19:55.000 --> 1:19:57.000]  Hell, somebody with a lobotomy can come up with that.
[1:19:57.000 --> 1:20:00.000]  That'd be that smart to come up with a crooked Hillary.
[1:20:00.000 --> 1:20:02.000]  So this is history happening right now.
[1:20:02.000 --> 1:20:05.000]  I want to skip this network break and David and I and the crew can pop whenever they want here.
[1:20:05.000 --> 1:20:09.000]  But I'm going to go get settled down in an office and just take a shower or something
[1:20:09.000 --> 1:20:11.000]  and just get on my knees and pray to God.
[1:20:11.000 --> 1:20:14.000]  I'll be honest with you, I want to get in a room by myself and hit my knees and start crying
[1:20:14.000 --> 1:20:17.000]  because this is so good.
[1:20:17.000 --> 1:20:20.000]  And I'm telling you, man, the evil's going to strike back.
[1:20:20.000 --> 1:20:22.000]  We got to be watching them. We got to be ready.
[1:20:22.000 --> 1:20:24.000]  But we know who they are. We know their plan.
[1:20:24.000 --> 1:20:29.000]  And I got to say it. It's been info wars. It's been info wars and you the people
[1:20:29.000 --> 1:20:34.000]  and our analysis has led the way as the blueprint battle plan to blow the hell out of them.
[1:20:34.000 --> 1:20:36.000]  I'll tell you, people always want me to take credit.
[1:20:36.000 --> 1:20:39.000]  I'm a humble person, but we need to take credit to know what we're doing is working.
[1:20:39.000 --> 1:20:44.000]  Info wars and our guests and myself and you the listeners, the eyes and ears on the ground
[1:20:44.000 --> 1:20:47.000]  and Matt Drudge and all of us together are the info war.
[1:20:47.000 --> 1:20:53.000]  We are the blueprint of the operating system that just kicked the new old owner's ass.
[1:20:53.000 --> 1:20:59.000]  We got it. It's America 2.0, supercharged, ready, common, committed.
[1:20:59.000 --> 1:21:04.000]  And our spirit trumps yours a thousand to one and our presidents even got the name from.
[1:21:04.000 --> 1:21:09.000]  So get ready. Yeah.
[1:21:09.000 --> 1:21:15.000]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[1:21:15.000 --> 1:21:18.000]  Hey, what's to get in here? Hey, you guys feel the energy?
[1:21:18.000 --> 1:21:22.000]  Americanism, my globalism will be our credo.
[1:21:22.000 --> 1:21:26.000]  I bless you sir. God bless you. God bless you.
[1:21:26.000 --> 1:21:30.000]  It's okay to love freedom. It's okay to believe. It's okay to be strong.
[1:21:30.000 --> 1:21:34.000]  Because here's the deal. We're not just getting hyped up by Trump and then feeling good.
[1:21:34.000 --> 1:21:38.000]  We have the tools. We have the means. We have the history.
[1:21:38.000 --> 1:21:41.000]  We got the pedigree. We got it all. Everybody here is America.
[1:21:41.000 --> 1:21:45.000]  And as long as you see the globalists bring people in, turn them against America.
[1:21:45.000 --> 1:21:49.000]  We're going to be able to bring a lot of people in once they're not getting brainwashed as soon as they get here.
[1:21:49.000 --> 1:21:52.000]  It's incredible time to be alive. Go ahead, sir.
[1:21:52.000 --> 1:21:55.000]  I'm with the bright part. What did you think of the speech? You really laid the wood to him.
[1:21:55.000 --> 1:22:00.000]  He laid the wood to him, but he empowered the people and let them know you are this revolution.
[1:22:00.000 --> 1:22:06.000]  You are the victory. And he just brought what everything George Washington envisioned back,
[1:22:06.000 --> 1:22:10.000]  America 2.0, and just basically rebooted and launched the system.
[1:22:10.000 --> 1:22:14.000]  And it came out of there like a fiery phoenix, fire-breathing dragon.
[1:22:14.000 --> 1:22:16.000]  The globalists aren't crapping their drawers right now.
[1:22:16.000 --> 1:22:22.000]  This was pure Americana and trailblazing and science and vision.
[1:22:22.000 --> 1:22:25.000]  And just absolutely empowering this country.
[1:22:25.000 --> 1:22:30.000]  Because under globalism, the decision was made to just shut us down and ship it overseas
[1:22:30.000 --> 1:22:33.000]  and parlay that into global power so some corporations could play God.
[1:22:33.000 --> 1:22:36.000]  But these corporations don't even have a vision or a spirit.
[1:22:36.000 --> 1:22:39.000]  It's just a bunch of empty guys up there claiming they're free market.
[1:22:39.000 --> 1:22:42.000]  But they're not free market. They're about to see real free market.
[1:22:42.000 --> 1:22:46.000]  They're about to see the Republic get up off of its knees.
[1:22:46.000 --> 1:22:49.000]  And it's happening now. America was reborn today.
[1:22:49.000 --> 1:22:55.000]  The spirituality of the speech, it was a very spiritual speech, unlike a lot of the rally speeches.
[1:22:55.000 --> 1:23:00.000]  And I tweeted right before. I said he's going to invoke the Providence.
[1:23:00.000 --> 1:23:04.000]  He's going to invoke the Covenant. And he did it because that's the key.
[1:23:04.000 --> 1:23:07.000]  Listen, I didn't even be that much of a religious person till I got deeper in and studied these people.
[1:23:07.000 --> 1:23:11.000]  They all understand that they have to get God out, not let us feel empowered,
[1:23:11.000 --> 1:23:14.000]  not let us know about America's destiny, not teach what George Washington said.
[1:23:14.000 --> 1:23:20.000]  They need to kill that narrative because from their atheist or globalist view from psychological view,
[1:23:20.000 --> 1:23:22.000]  it gives us a culture that unifies us.
[1:23:22.000 --> 1:23:26.000]  So they've been killing our culture and then they've been bringing in this alien culture
[1:23:26.000 --> 1:23:30.000]  of everybody hating each other and fighting with each other and trying to bring us down.
[1:23:30.000 --> 1:23:32.000]  But then while they suck and sap our energy.
[1:23:32.000 --> 1:23:36.000]  So the second phase of slavery just fell today.
[1:23:36.000 --> 1:23:38.000]  Humans are trying to progress through the future.
[1:23:38.000 --> 1:23:41.000]  That's why they call themselves the progressives. They're the opposite. They're not the progressives.
[1:23:41.000 --> 1:23:45.000]  They're regressives. That's what the Jacobin Party was about.
[1:23:45.000 --> 1:23:50.000]  And that's what the Democrats were called, was the Jacobin or French Revolution Party.
[1:23:50.000 --> 1:23:54.000]  They wanted to regress everything and basically set up their own new tyranny.
[1:23:54.000 --> 1:23:59.000]  What you're seeing here is the real Renaissance and what you're seeing here is the real 1776.
[1:23:59.000 --> 1:24:06.000]  The last thing, sir, the subtext of Senator Schumer's speech about going into battle,
[1:24:06.000 --> 1:24:09.000]  was that a call to arms to the left to keep fighting?
[1:24:09.000 --> 1:24:12.000]  Yes, he was trying to get everybody to boo him so he could say,
[1:24:12.000 --> 1:24:14.000]  oh, I came and I was nice and they were mean to me.
[1:24:14.000 --> 1:24:15.000]  But everybody slept through it.
[1:24:15.000 --> 1:24:17.000]  Yeah, everybody slept through it. He was clearly putting the knife in. Sorry.
[1:24:17.000 --> 1:24:20.000]  I'm like, you know, trying to twist it. People didn't really take the bait.
[1:24:20.000 --> 1:24:24.000]  I caught myself trying to take the bait and I went, no, no, he's trying to set us up.
[1:24:24.000 --> 1:24:27.000]  And then it just failed.
[1:24:27.000 --> 1:24:31.000]  He was just trying to bring back all this open old wounds and flinging a mess.
[1:24:31.000 --> 1:24:32.000]  Big mess.
[1:24:32.000 --> 1:24:37.000]  Yeah, Donald Trump had a grand slam today and Chuckie Schumer or Chuckie Scammer.
[1:24:37.000 --> 1:24:40.000]  I mean, it just, it was a total foul ball. He just, he failed.
[1:24:40.000 --> 1:24:41.000]  Thank you very much, sir.
[1:24:41.000 --> 1:24:42.000]  All right. Thank you so much.
[1:24:42.000 --> 1:24:44.000]  He's still on here.
[1:24:44.000 --> 1:24:46.000]  All right. Yes, sir.
[1:24:46.000 --> 1:24:48.000]  God bless you. Anybody else want to get on team radio?
[1:24:48.000 --> 1:24:50.000]  Here, sir. Come on in here.
[1:24:50.000 --> 1:24:51.000]  Sharp breast fella.
[1:24:51.000 --> 1:24:52.000]  What's your name, sir?
[1:24:52.000 --> 1:24:53.000]  Marshall McGill.
[1:24:53.000 --> 1:24:55.000]  Marshall McGill. We'll talk about it here. Take over.
[1:24:55.000 --> 1:24:56.000]  Hey, hey, you know what?
[1:24:56.000 --> 1:24:58.000]  Today was the beginning of something new.
[1:24:58.000 --> 1:25:00.000]  We've been waiting for this for a long time.
[1:25:00.000 --> 1:25:06.000]  And, you know, the most important thing I saw the day was that our president is putting back
[1:25:06.000 --> 1:25:09.000]  America first. We've been compromising.
[1:25:09.000 --> 1:25:11.000]  We've been putting everybody else second.
[1:25:11.000 --> 1:25:12.000]  We didn't want to hurt anybody's feelings.
[1:25:12.000 --> 1:25:13.000]  We were politically correct.
[1:25:13.000 --> 1:25:18.000]  And today our president says America has nothing wrong with any other country putting
[1:25:18.000 --> 1:25:19.000]  themselves first.
[1:25:19.000 --> 1:25:21.000]  But we're going to put ourselves first.
[1:25:21.000 --> 1:25:23.000]  And we're going to focus on building our inner cities.
[1:25:23.000 --> 1:25:25.000]  We're going to focus on building our rural areas out west.
[1:25:25.000 --> 1:25:27.000]  We're going to be focusing on education.
[1:25:27.000 --> 1:25:31.000]  And most of all, what I got today was that our president says we're going to put God
[1:25:31.000 --> 1:25:32.000]  first.
[1:25:32.000 --> 1:25:33.000]  Right.
[1:25:33.000 --> 1:25:38.000]  And the president says in Proverbs 14 and 30 that the righteous exalts the nation and
[1:25:38.000 --> 1:25:39.000]  sin brings it down.
[1:25:39.000 --> 1:25:40.000]  That's it.
[1:25:40.000 --> 1:25:41.000]  He brought the power back here.
[1:25:41.000 --> 1:25:42.000]  There you go.
[1:25:42.000 --> 1:25:43.000]  We can't do anything without God.
[1:25:43.000 --> 1:25:46.000]  And when we put God first, nothing will be impossible for us.
[1:25:46.000 --> 1:25:51.000]  So the most important thing it is today, out of all the different agendas and so forth,
[1:25:51.000 --> 1:25:52.000]  was putting God first.
[1:25:52.000 --> 1:25:56.000]  And if we seek God first, everything else will be added to it.
[1:25:56.000 --> 1:25:59.000]  So I'm encouraged today that we're starting over.
[1:25:59.000 --> 1:26:01.000]  I'm encouraged today that we're putting God first.
[1:26:01.000 --> 1:26:04.000]  And I believe this nation is going to see a quick turnaround.
[1:26:04.000 --> 1:26:07.000]  I'm not talking about years and years, but we're going to see the first year seem like
[1:26:07.000 --> 1:26:10.000]  he's been in office 10 years because God has going to be on it.
[1:26:10.000 --> 1:26:11.000]  You watch what God says.
[1:26:11.000 --> 1:26:12.000]  Hey there.
[1:26:12.000 --> 1:26:13.000]  I want to continue.
[1:26:13.000 --> 1:26:15.000]  Listen, it's not mumbo jumbo.
[1:26:15.000 --> 1:26:19.000]  They were very sick about this piece, but I could feel it when I was going in there.
[1:26:19.000 --> 1:26:23.000]  I said, I feel like Providence, he's going to invoke God and bring God back in and ask
[1:26:23.000 --> 1:26:24.000]  us to accept God in.
[1:26:24.000 --> 1:26:28.000]  And that will just like fill the vacuum and push all this evil out.
[1:26:28.000 --> 1:26:30.000]  I mean, you take God out, evil pours in.
[1:26:30.000 --> 1:26:31.000]  You can feel it.
[1:26:31.000 --> 1:26:32.000]  Yeah.
[1:26:32.000 --> 1:26:33.000]  Yeah.
[1:26:33.000 --> 1:26:34.000]  Absolutely.
[1:26:34.000 --> 1:26:35.000]  Absolutely.
[1:26:35.000 --> 1:26:36.000]  It's about who you pursue.
[1:26:36.000 --> 1:26:39.000]  And wherever you pursue and wherever your aims are, that's where your energy and the
[1:26:39.000 --> 1:26:40.000]  power is going to come from.
[1:26:40.000 --> 1:26:41.000]  And we put God first.
[1:26:41.000 --> 1:26:42.000]  Like we're doing today.
[1:26:42.000 --> 1:26:43.000]  It's just the beginning.
[1:26:43.000 --> 1:26:46.000]  It's not night is going to happen.
[1:26:46.000 --> 1:26:51.000]  But when we begin to pursue God, this might say at one time, if you can't run a walk,
[1:26:51.000 --> 1:26:53.000]  if you can't walk, then crawl.
[1:26:53.000 --> 1:26:55.000]  And if you can't crawl, just look that way.
[1:26:55.000 --> 1:26:59.000]  And when you turn your eyes that way and God, he looks at us.
[1:26:59.000 --> 1:27:02.000]  Then you start walking, then you start running.
[1:27:02.000 --> 1:27:04.000]  And then you begin to see changes.
[1:27:04.000 --> 1:27:07.000]  And I really believe that the day America has woken up.
[1:27:07.000 --> 1:27:08.000]  And you know what?
[1:27:08.000 --> 1:27:13.000]  Regardless of what your political party is, what you believe personally, morally or whatever.
[1:27:13.000 --> 1:27:16.000]  But the fact is that we have to embrace democracy.
[1:27:16.000 --> 1:27:17.000]  America spoke.
[1:27:17.000 --> 1:27:18.000]  America won.
[1:27:18.000 --> 1:27:20.000]  And America has his country back.
[1:27:20.000 --> 1:27:21.000]  Absolutely.
[1:27:21.000 --> 1:27:26.000]  And I want to warn the elite, even if they kill Trump, the spirit is us.
[1:27:26.000 --> 1:27:29.000]  As we kept saying, it's already been opened up.
[1:27:29.000 --> 1:27:30.000]  It's already rising.
[1:27:30.000 --> 1:27:32.000]  And they're not going to stop it.
[1:27:32.000 --> 1:27:34.000]  All of the world countries are trying to get off under the globalists.
[1:27:34.000 --> 1:27:36.000]  The globalists are very, very evil.
[1:27:36.000 --> 1:27:39.000]  And they're trying to set up their world government that the Bible tells us about.
[1:27:39.000 --> 1:27:40.000]  These are evil people.
[1:27:40.000 --> 1:27:42.000]  Yeah, we're living in the last days.
[1:27:42.000 --> 1:27:44.000]  We're living in perilous times.
[1:27:44.000 --> 1:27:49.000]  And the Bible says that the kingdom of heaven suffers violence and the violence taken by force.
[1:27:49.000 --> 1:27:51.000]  We can no longer be passive.
[1:27:51.000 --> 1:27:55.000]  We can no longer just sit back and watch our country go to heaven.
[1:27:55.000 --> 1:27:56.000]  We can't go to hell.
[1:27:56.000 --> 1:27:57.000]  We can't do that.
[1:27:57.000 --> 1:27:59.000]  We've got to stand up for what is right.
[1:27:59.000 --> 1:28:04.000]  And we've got to take our positions as men and women of God, not just for us, but we're
[1:28:04.000 --> 1:28:08.000]  going to be judged by what happens to the generations behind us.
[1:28:08.000 --> 1:28:11.000]  So it's imperative that we take a stand for what is right.
[1:28:11.000 --> 1:28:13.000]  And we're going to have differences.
[1:28:13.000 --> 1:28:14.000]  We're going to have disagreements.
[1:28:14.000 --> 1:28:17.000]  We're not going to always go together on everything.
[1:28:17.000 --> 1:28:23.000]  But the most important thing that we can do is agree to disagree and then in peace seek
[1:28:23.000 --> 1:28:28.000]  the higher position of that particular principle or whatever we're debating on.
[1:28:28.000 --> 1:28:34.000]  But I believe, I honestly believe all my heart that today America has taken a step.
[1:28:34.000 --> 1:28:35.000]  And you know what?
[1:28:35.000 --> 1:28:39.000]  It's not just America, but there are countries all around the world that have been waiting
[1:28:39.000 --> 1:28:41.000]  on us to do this.
[1:28:41.000 --> 1:28:46.000]  The Bible says in Romans 80 says that the creation, they mown and groan, waiting on the manifestation
[1:28:46.000 --> 1:28:49.000]  of the sons of God, but it does not appear what they should be.
[1:28:49.000 --> 1:28:55.000]  There are people out there waiting for America to take its stand again, and they will support
[1:28:55.000 --> 1:28:56.000]  us.
[1:28:56.000 --> 1:29:02.000]  But this divisiveness, this black, this white, this all this stuff, it's just political.
[1:29:02.000 --> 1:29:05.000]  It's just the enemy because we don't wrestle against flesh and blood.
[1:29:05.000 --> 1:29:09.000]  But I believe that today we're on the right track, but we're on the right track.
[1:29:09.000 --> 1:29:11.000]  Have you ever felt the spirit stronger than it is?
[1:29:11.000 --> 1:29:12.000]  No, no.
[1:29:12.000 --> 1:29:14.000]  And I watched the rabbi speak.
[1:29:14.000 --> 1:29:17.000]  I watched Paula White speak.
[1:29:17.000 --> 1:29:19.000]  I watched the African American.
[1:29:19.000 --> 1:29:23.000]  And I saw, and I saw that and I heard what President Trump said in his speech.
[1:29:23.000 --> 1:29:26.000]  I'm telling you right now, we put God first.
[1:29:26.000 --> 1:29:29.000]  That's never ever that I can remember.
[1:29:29.000 --> 1:29:32.000]  Did you see how the Democrats were squirming up there?
[1:29:32.000 --> 1:29:33.000]  Look, you're gonna squirm.
[1:29:33.000 --> 1:29:35.000]  When truth is coming forth, you're gonna squirm.
[1:29:35.000 --> 1:29:36.000]  Let me say something to you.
[1:29:36.000 --> 1:29:42.000]  This has probably been one of the, one of the few times I've heard the name Jesus Christ
[1:29:42.000 --> 1:29:48.000]  mentioned in inauguration as much as it was mentioned today and not mentioned out of fear
[1:29:48.000 --> 1:29:51.000]  or intimidation, but with confidence and boldness.
[1:29:51.000 --> 1:29:56.000]  It was mentioned because people realize that the only way this America that we serve, that we love,
[1:29:56.000 --> 1:30:01.000]  is going to be back on top again like it's supposed to be and be great again is that we put God first.
[1:30:01.000 --> 1:30:05.000]  Well, even foreign leaders throughout history of Marvel, the luck of America and Providence,
[1:30:05.000 --> 1:30:11.000]  Bismarck said God loves children, drunks, and the United States of America.
[1:30:11.000 --> 1:30:13.000]  So, well, God bless you, anything else, sir?
[1:30:13.000 --> 1:30:15.000]  No, that's it. God bless you. Thank you.
[1:30:15.000 --> 1:30:16.000]  Don't you say something, sir?
[1:30:16.000 --> 1:30:17.000]  Yes, sir.
[1:30:17.000 --> 1:30:18.000]  Anybody else?
[1:30:18.000 --> 1:30:19.000]  Yes, sir.
[1:30:19.000 --> 1:30:20.000]  Thank you.
[1:30:20.000 --> 1:30:21.000]  We're on the march.
[1:30:21.000 --> 1:30:23.000]  The Empire's on the run.
[1:30:23.000 --> 1:30:27.000]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[1:30:30.000 --> 1:30:36.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, Project Veritas has just released part two of their undercover investigation
[1:30:36.000 --> 1:30:42.000]  into the disrupt J20 protest and what we have discovered is absolutely sickening.
[1:30:42.000 --> 1:30:48.000]  This could be considered terrorism, chemical acid attacks into ventilation systems,
[1:30:48.000 --> 1:30:52.000]  tying chains to rail systems to stop traffic,
[1:30:52.000 --> 1:30:58.000]  having meetings talking about how they're going to cause cluster Fs in traffic.
[1:30:58.000 --> 1:31:02.000]  These people are violent. Where is James Comey of the FBI?
[1:31:02.000 --> 1:31:05.000]  Why haven't people been arrested? Why has the media not covered this?
[1:31:05.000 --> 1:31:10.000]  This is absurd. These people are mentally deranged and need to be arrested.
[1:31:10.000 --> 1:31:15.000]  If they get away with this, we are going to be looking squarely at the media and squarely at the FBI
[1:31:15.000 --> 1:31:22.000]  that they did nothing to stop this terrorist attack from stopping the peaceful transition of power.
[1:31:22.000 --> 1:31:37.000]  This is Owen Schreuer from infowars.com and I'll see you at the inauguration.

[1:33:32.000 --> 1:33:38.000]  These arrogant globalists thought they defeated humanity. The truth is, whether it's Obama or George Soros,
[1:33:38.000 --> 1:33:44.000]  they're losers. Everything they had, everything they threw against us, failed.
[1:33:44.000 --> 1:33:50.000]  Now, just because we defeated these tyrants for now doesn't mean we've won the war.
[1:33:50.000 --> 1:33:56.000]  The war is happening within our hearts, within our souls and our minds. We have to be good.
[1:33:56.000 --> 1:34:00.000]  We have to be pure. We have to be strong. We have to build prosperity.
[1:34:00.000 --> 1:34:06.000]  We have to bring every one of every race, color and creed together if we're going to truly defeat these tyrants
[1:34:06.000 --> 1:34:10.000]  who believe we were going to fail, who believe their divide and conquer would work.
[1:34:10.000 --> 1:34:18.000]  Yes, we've won the first face, but the battle for the soul of humanity has just begun.
[1:34:18.000 --> 1:34:26.000]  But Obama and Hillary and Soros, you were losers from the day you were born.
[1:34:26.000 --> 1:34:44.000]  This is the heart of 1776. You're a white male!
[1:34:44.000 --> 1:34:48.000]  It's also what happens when you listen to the radio host, Alex Jones.
[1:34:48.000 --> 1:34:52.000]  Move, bitch! Get out of the way!
[1:34:52.000 --> 1:34:58.000]  We pledge allegiance to one flag and that flag is the American flag.
[1:34:58.000 --> 1:35:02.000]  Info wars helped fuel the rumor that President Obama is an ISIS supporter.
[1:35:02.000 --> 1:35:06.000]  It's been a cozy relationship from the beginning.
[1:35:06.000 --> 1:35:12.000]  I will not let you down. You'll be very, very impressed, I hope, and I think we'll be speaking a lot.
[1:35:12.000 --> 1:35:14.000]  Donald Trump and Alex Jones.
[1:35:14.000 --> 1:35:20.000]  This means that Donald Trump will be the 45th President of the United States.
[1:35:20.000 --> 1:35:26.000]  Waging war on corruption. It's Alex Jones.
[1:35:26.000 --> 1:35:30.000]  And ladies and gentlemen, we are back live. David Knight and the rest of the great crew are there in studio.
[1:35:30.000 --> 1:35:34.000]  I'm going to talk to a few more people out here on the street, and then I'm going to go get a little bite to eat,
[1:35:34.000 --> 1:35:38.000]  and then I'm going to be back on. I really need to focus, write some notes, and just be very humble,
[1:35:38.000 --> 1:35:45.000]  because this is a very special time. The evil that was getting ready to unfold, you saw things were already evil.
[1:35:45.000 --> 1:35:51.000]  They were about to launch the full evil. Total takeover of the media, arresting patriots, torturing us,
[1:35:51.000 --> 1:35:56.000]  I mean, the whole nine yards, and it was so horrible that even the intelligence agencies just said,
[1:35:56.000 --> 1:36:01.000]  we just can't do this. This is crazy. It's like a comic book of evil. I mean, it's just so evil.
[1:36:01.000 --> 1:36:05.000]  You see movies, you read history books, both fiction and non-fiction.
[1:36:05.000 --> 1:36:08.000]  You think things like this can't really be happening until you see it happen.
[1:36:08.000 --> 1:36:12.000]  And we saw a guy trying to get three llamas in this morning, pass online security,
[1:36:12.000 --> 1:36:16.000]  and it's like we had sick photos out there. No one would believe it. I'm going to put those up later.
[1:36:16.000 --> 1:36:20.000]  It's like a bomb in the llama or something. I mean, it's just so much.
[1:36:20.000 --> 1:36:26.000]  My point is, crazy stuff's going on. Roger Stone shows up in a huge top hat. He's been poisoned by polonium.
[1:36:26.000 --> 1:36:31.000]  We're living in crazy times. To the left, the right, all points of the compass. It is wild.
[1:36:31.000 --> 1:36:34.000]  Sir, tell us who you are and tell us what you think about this today. Good to meet you.
[1:36:34.000 --> 1:36:39.000]  Nice to be here. Nice to see you. My name is Philip Thomas. I'm a naturalized American citizen.
[1:36:39.000 --> 1:36:42.000]  I lived in many parts of the world. I lived in Muslim countries.
[1:36:42.000 --> 1:36:50.000]  And I know how human rights are being violated, you know, and people of other religions are treated like dirt.
[1:36:50.000 --> 1:36:55.000]  And this country is a great country for the past eight years. We had a nightmare with Obama.
[1:36:55.000 --> 1:37:02.000]  And that nightmare is over today. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
[1:37:02.000 --> 1:37:07.000]  The other brother, the African-American brother said a lot of quotation he gave from the Bible.
[1:37:07.000 --> 1:37:13.000]  You read Daniel chapter two. You will find God is the installer and God is the remover of kings.
[1:37:13.000 --> 1:37:18.000]  Today, God had installed Mr. Trump as the president of this country.
[1:37:18.000 --> 1:37:23.000]  That's right. We voted, but nothing the enemy could do worked. It all turned against it was Providence.
[1:37:23.000 --> 1:37:25.000]  I can't tell you the Providence I've experienced.
[1:37:25.000 --> 1:37:31.000]  You know, my heart bleeds when I see the young people supporting Democratic Party, which is directionless.
[1:37:31.000 --> 1:37:39.000]  And now, you know what's happening with Democratic Party? They're trying to take Keith Ellison as the chief and he is Islamist.
[1:37:39.000 --> 1:37:44.000]  He wants to destroy United States. And Americans should wake up.
[1:37:44.000 --> 1:37:50.000]  If you don't wake up, you will be in your slumber and your slumber will lead to death.
[1:37:50.000 --> 1:37:55.000]  The war Muslims have divided the world into two parts, Darul Harb and Darul Islam.
[1:37:55.000 --> 1:38:03.000]  Where Islamic rule is there, it is known as Darul Islam, which means house of Islam. And when there is no Islamic rule, it is known as Darul Harb, which means house of war.
[1:38:03.000 --> 1:38:12.000]  And the house of Islam should wage constantly war against the house of war, which is Darul Harb.
[1:38:12.000 --> 1:38:18.000]  Now, America is considered as Darul Harb by the Darul Islam, and they are waging a war against us.
[1:38:18.000 --> 1:38:20.000]  D-Had is the weapon they are using.
[1:38:20.000 --> 1:38:26.000]  P-Could you believe, though, that in Europe and here, they actually sold out in Brennan as the head of the CIA is a hardcore Wahhabist?
[1:38:26.000 --> 1:38:28.000]  D-Yes. P-And this has been put up with?
[1:38:28.000 --> 1:38:34.000]  D-And so we have to be careful. And Alex Jones is doing a great job. I've been watching his videos on YouTube.
[1:38:34.000 --> 1:38:42.000]  And my son, who lives in India, always calls and tells me, don't forget, don't, don't, don't neglect Alex Jones' views.
[1:38:42.000 --> 1:38:46.000]  It's very important, and it will save America. And I'm so glad-
[1:38:46.000 --> 1:38:52.000]  P-Yes, of course you have. And after tomorrow, I'm flying to India. And I'm going to be an ambassador for Mr. Trump.
[1:38:52.000 --> 1:38:56.000]  D-Great. But enough about me. Talk about where you see the country going.
[1:38:56.000 --> 1:38:58.000]  P-Pardon? D-Talk about me. I mean, talk about where you see the country going.
[1:38:58.000 --> 1:39:02.000]  P-Oh, sorry. Yeah, yeah. So we have to be very careful about the Islamic agenda.
[1:39:02.000 --> 1:39:06.000]  You know, they say Muslims are all good. Oh, let them be good at home.
[1:39:06.000 --> 1:39:12.000]  Okay? But they want to destroy United States. Outside United States, they said, America is a devil.
[1:39:12.000 --> 1:39:17.000]  But yeah, they say God bless America. It's Taqiyah. There's an Arabic, a Muslim doctor called Al-Taqiyah.
[1:39:17.000 --> 1:39:26.000]  Lie before your enemy, but hate them in your heart. That's what's happening. So America should wake up and give an answer.
[1:39:26.000 --> 1:39:29.000]  D-Well, I think America is starting to wake up. P-Yes.
[1:39:29.000 --> 1:39:33.000]  D-If they kill Trump, which I know they're seriously considering doing, I think it'll be an even bigger defeat for them.
[1:39:33.000 --> 1:39:38.000]  P-No, no. I don't think that will happen because our police, our military, our secret service, they're all strong.
[1:39:38.000 --> 1:39:40.000]  D-Yeah, the best. P-I agree, but they're going to try as I'm saying.
[1:39:40.000 --> 1:39:44.000]  D-Oh, yeah, of course, yes. Yes, of course, they'll try, but they try being vain.
[1:39:44.000 --> 1:39:50.000]  But Trump will triumph. Jesus will protect, Jesus will protect, yes.
[1:39:50.000 --> 1:39:57.000]  Because God is the installer and has installed Mr. Trump to become the president of this greatest nation
[1:39:57.000 --> 1:40:01.000]  and the greatest superpower ever in the history of mankind.
[1:40:01.000 --> 1:40:10.000]  P-So, I'm so glad to be here. And if you want some of my views, I can tell you what America should become strong.
[1:40:10.000 --> 1:40:13.000]  A strong America is the one which will stop its globalization of this world.
[1:40:13.000 --> 1:40:21.000]  D-Well, let's talk about this. I mean, look at how the globalists are so upset right now. They can tell the tide's turning.
[1:40:21.000 --> 1:40:24.000]  Q, I've got to get your view. You've got to use all this thing. Get over here. No, you're getting on air.
[1:40:24.000 --> 1:40:26.000]  I'm sorry, you're doing it.
[1:40:26.000 --> 1:40:28.000]  P-Thank you, sir. Thank you very much.
[1:40:28.000 --> 1:40:31.000]  Here, over here in the back of his head. What do you think about this situation?
[1:40:31.000 --> 1:40:33.000]  Hey, Zernan, you get in there. I didn't know Zernan was here.
[1:40:33.000 --> 1:40:35.000]  What's Zernan? Tell us what you think.
[1:40:35.000 --> 1:40:40.000]  A-This entire inauguration has been extremely historic, obviously. And just seeing the energy...
[1:40:40.000 --> 1:40:42.000]  Completely. Seeing the energy of...
[1:40:42.000 --> 1:40:49.000]  A seismic pole shaft, a supernova of enlightenment. A tidal release of the Titans of Liberty.
[1:40:49.000 --> 1:40:50.000]  Yeah.
[1:40:50.000 --> 1:40:51.000]  Yeah, sorry, go ahead.
[1:40:51.000 --> 1:40:56.000]  The look people had going in this morning was obviously already high energy.
[1:40:56.000 --> 1:41:00.000]  But just leaving today, seeing all the people leaving, they're re-energized.
[1:41:00.000 --> 1:41:03.000]  They're rejuvenated and ready to make America great again.
[1:41:03.000 --> 1:41:07.000]  Absolutely. And again, it's not that the Republican establishment's had to get Trump.
[1:41:07.000 --> 1:41:12.000]  I hate the Republican establishment, but some of the Democrats, it's so obvious that he's anti-New World Order and awesome.
[1:41:12.000 --> 1:41:14.000]  You're awesome. Come on here on air.
[1:41:14.000 --> 1:41:16.000]  I made it here.
[1:41:16.000 --> 1:41:17.000]  Well, you're awesome.
[1:41:17.000 --> 1:41:18.000]  Oh my God, I love you.
[1:41:18.000 --> 1:41:20.000]  You're awesome. You're awesome. Here, talk to folks out there.
[1:41:20.000 --> 1:41:21.000]  I love you.
[1:41:21.000 --> 1:41:22.000]  Come on, stop. Here, talk to folks out there.
[1:41:22.000 --> 1:41:24.000]  I have my info wars right now here.
[1:41:24.000 --> 1:41:26.000]  Thank you. Go ahead, talk to folks.
[1:41:26.000 --> 1:41:28.000]  Oh my God, somebody take a picture of me, please.
[1:41:28.000 --> 1:41:30.000]  What do you think about the whole inauguration?
[1:41:30.000 --> 1:41:36.000]  I am like so, I am like, my heart is so happy.
[1:41:36.000 --> 1:41:40.000]  I just love this. I love Mr. Trump.
[1:41:40.000 --> 1:41:44.000]  I met him in 2013, and he is such a good person.
[1:41:44.000 --> 1:41:53.000]  And when I found out he was running, I had to run down and fly down to Miami, and he has such a good heart.
[1:41:53.000 --> 1:41:56.000]  He is not a racist. He loves this country.
[1:41:56.000 --> 1:42:02.000]  And he just wants to unite us, just like he said in this speech, we all bleed red.
[1:42:02.000 --> 1:42:11.000]  Every one of us, white, red, white, you know, black, Hispanic, Japanese, whoever you are.
[1:42:11.000 --> 1:42:14.000]  We are all red, and we are patriots.
[1:42:14.000 --> 1:42:18.000]  And I love Alex Jones because he's the only one I listen to.
[1:42:18.000 --> 1:42:21.000]  Well, thanks for coming. It was awesome. History happened.
[1:42:21.000 --> 1:42:23.000]  I was going to bring my son, but it's just too dangerous.
[1:42:23.000 --> 1:42:26.000]  They were attacking women. I mean, all of them were coming by bleeding.
[1:42:26.000 --> 1:42:31.000]  I go, what's going on? Women on crutches. Old ladies are like, they're beating us up, trying to get in.
[1:42:31.000 --> 1:42:34.000]  The leftists down there, and I went down there, and they attacked us.
[1:42:34.000 --> 1:42:38.000]  I mean, it's just like, what the hell? And they really go, Nazi, Nazi, Nazi.
[1:42:38.000 --> 1:42:41.000]  I'm like, what the hell are you talking about? They're like, Putin's a Nazi.
[1:42:41.000 --> 1:42:45.000]  It's the Russians who beat the Nazis, dumbass. They just don't know anything.
[1:42:45.000 --> 1:42:48.000]  They just have no historical end. They just believe MSNBC.
[1:42:48.000 --> 1:42:53.000]  I'll tell you, only a few thousand of the protesters, millions of people away,
[1:42:53.000 --> 1:42:56.000]  and your BS is coming to an end.
[1:42:56.000 --> 1:43:05.000]  1776 worldwide. All right, listen, guys, David Knight, you guys can pop in whenever you want here.
[1:43:05.000 --> 1:43:08.000]  David, what do you think of all this? Leigh Ann, everybody.
[1:43:08.000 --> 1:43:13.000]  Well, you know, Alex, listening to the preachers that have been there and the other crowd that have been there,
[1:43:13.000 --> 1:43:17.000]  I think it's pretty important to go back and look at what Franklin Graham said.
[1:43:17.000 --> 1:43:19.000]  He said in the Bible, as he got up and spoke, he said,
[1:43:19.000 --> 1:43:23.000]  the Bible reign is a sign of God's blessing, and it started to reign when you came to the platform.
[1:43:23.000 --> 1:43:29.000]  I think it's real important to look at the massive difference between Donald Trump and Barack Obama.
[1:43:29.000 --> 1:43:34.000]  It was Barack Obama who denigrated people, who looked to God,
[1:43:34.000 --> 1:43:38.000]  said these bitter clingers with their Bibles and their guns.
[1:43:38.000 --> 1:43:40.000]  Well, you know what? Maybe we're better clingers.
[1:43:40.000 --> 1:43:43.000]  Not that we're better people, but we're clinging to better things.
[1:43:43.000 --> 1:43:44.000]  Right.
[1:43:44.000 --> 1:43:51.000]  And what we're seeing here from Donald Trump is someone who is going to honor God,
[1:43:51.000 --> 1:43:55.000]  as that pastor said, put God first, look for his blessing.
[1:43:55.000 --> 1:43:59.000]  And I think another key thing that we need to look at here, as Donald Trump talked about God,
[1:43:59.000 --> 1:44:04.000]  deferred to God as our protector, he also referred to himself only three times
[1:44:04.000 --> 1:44:06.000]  in two different sentences as a daily caller points out.
[1:44:06.000 --> 1:44:11.000]  And yet we saw just last night, Barack Obama and his final speech to the press
[1:44:11.000 --> 1:44:18.000]  referred to himself 45 times, even talked about himself as being no drama Obama.
[1:44:18.000 --> 1:44:25.000]  75 times in his farewell address, 118 times when he was out stumping for Hillary Clinton.
[1:44:25.000 --> 1:44:28.000]  People actually thought he was going to be running for president again,
[1:44:28.000 --> 1:44:30.000]  because he was talking about himself so much.
[1:44:30.000 --> 1:44:35.000]  How refreshing to see Donald Trump say, this is giving the power back to you, the people.
[1:44:35.000 --> 1:44:36.000]  It's not about me.
[1:44:36.000 --> 1:44:38.000]  That's right, Leanne. We're going to go back to you in just a moment.
[1:44:38.000 --> 1:44:41.000]  There's just a few more people in here and I'm going to hand the baton to you guys.
[1:44:41.000 --> 1:44:43.000]  You ladies that want to get ready. Go ahead, ma'am.
[1:44:43.000 --> 1:44:46.000]  Hi, my name is Leanne. I'm here with Alex Jones.
[1:44:46.000 --> 1:44:51.000]  We're celebrating one of the most historic things that ever happened in the United States of America.
[1:44:51.000 --> 1:44:54.000]  We actually got the power back to the people.
[1:44:54.000 --> 1:44:56.000]  Donald Trump gave us that power today.
[1:44:56.000 --> 1:45:00.000]  And God blessed us. God bless America. God bless Donald Trump today.
[1:45:00.000 --> 1:45:04.000]  And I just thank God for you, Alex Jones, for helping to wake so many people up.
[1:45:04.000 --> 1:45:06.000]  You don't realize how many people you touched.
[1:45:06.000 --> 1:45:10.000]  I've been listening to you for over a decade and been following the truth.
[1:45:10.000 --> 1:45:12.000]  And God bless you for...
[1:45:12.000 --> 1:45:15.000]  It's very humbling. Thank you, but God bless you guys for being involved
[1:45:15.000 --> 1:45:17.000]  and not letting the media bully you into submission.
[1:45:17.000 --> 1:45:18.000]  Absolutely.
[1:45:18.000 --> 1:45:20.000]  Ladies who wanted to talk from Pennsylvania, great job.
[1:45:20.000 --> 1:45:22.000]  Thank you. Thank you, great job.
[1:45:22.000 --> 1:45:23.000]  God bless you.
[1:45:23.000 --> 1:45:25.000]  I'll tell you, this almost doesn't go to these ladies.
[1:45:25.000 --> 1:45:29.000]  What's happening here is the globalists got so delusional that all their hate and all their lies
[1:45:29.000 --> 1:45:33.000]  and all their disinfo didn't turn people the way they thought it turned them away from them.
[1:45:33.000 --> 1:45:37.000]  They have become insane and they can't admit they're failing on every front.
[1:45:37.000 --> 1:45:39.000]  And Trump has said he's changed the last few years.
[1:45:39.000 --> 1:45:41.000]  I have too, but so does everybody else.
[1:45:41.000 --> 1:45:42.000]  It's like the hundred monkeys.
[1:45:42.000 --> 1:45:46.000]  If you want to not believe in spirit or sixth sense that's been proven,
[1:45:46.000 --> 1:45:50.000]  it's that they'll have like an island with monkeys 20 miles away, the same species.
[1:45:50.000 --> 1:45:53.000]  And as soon as a certain number of monkeys on one island learn something,
[1:45:53.000 --> 1:45:56.000]  they don't know why suddenly the other ones 20 miles away learn.
[1:45:56.000 --> 1:46:01.000]  And so there's something going on and it's like, it's the invisible human internet.
[1:46:01.000 --> 1:46:04.000]  And so right now, Trump is growing too.
[1:46:04.000 --> 1:46:07.000]  And Trump is imagining all the stuff he's getting hit by in the discernment.
[1:46:07.000 --> 1:46:10.000]  And he's asking God for providence and to leave God and direct him,
[1:46:10.000 --> 1:46:14.000]  imagine what he's going to be given just as George Washington grew, grew, grew
[1:46:14.000 --> 1:46:16.000]  with all the discernment he was given.
[1:46:16.000 --> 1:46:17.000]  Come on, man.
[1:46:17.000 --> 1:46:18.000]  Come on in here.
[1:46:18.000 --> 1:46:19.000]  Whoever wants to get in here.
[1:46:19.000 --> 1:46:21.000]  And I'm going to hand the baton over right now the next 15 minutes.
[1:46:21.000 --> 1:46:23.000]  David Knight, you guys will be over in a minute.
[1:46:23.000 --> 1:46:24.000]  Come on in here, sir.
[1:46:24.000 --> 1:46:25.000]  From Amazon, we'll talk.
[1:46:25.000 --> 1:46:26.000]  Go ahead.
[1:46:26.000 --> 1:46:28.000]  Whoever wants to talk, just jump in.
[1:46:28.000 --> 1:46:33.000]  Okay, I just want to say it's an amazing experience being here and finally having
[1:46:33.000 --> 1:46:37.000]  a previous regime end and he, I don't know,
[1:46:37.000 --> 1:46:41.000]  given the truth and a new light by Alex and all the people in the new media.
[1:46:41.000 --> 1:46:47.000]  And I just an unabashed plug DNA of force by a truce,
[1:46:47.000 --> 1:46:48.000]  Millennium, pleased by the products.
[1:46:48.000 --> 1:46:49.000]  They're fantastic.
[1:46:49.000 --> 1:46:53.000]  And, you know, I know you don't plug enough and so just buy and support the freedom.
[1:46:53.000 --> 1:46:56.000]  We're crushing the old stream media and it's a new dawn.
[1:46:56.000 --> 1:46:57.000]  It's a new era.
[1:46:57.000 --> 1:46:58.000]  It's exciting.
[1:46:58.000 --> 1:47:00.000]  It's, I can't believe it's over.
[1:47:00.000 --> 1:47:01.000]  I like that.
[1:47:01.000 --> 1:47:02.000]  The old stream.
[1:47:02.000 --> 1:47:03.000]  It's the era of the people.
[1:47:03.000 --> 1:47:05.000]  It's the era of a new America.
[1:47:05.000 --> 1:47:06.000]  Beautiful, brother.
[1:47:06.000 --> 1:47:07.000]  Beautiful.
[1:47:07.000 --> 1:47:08.000]  All right, guys.
[1:47:08.000 --> 1:47:10.000]  Anybody else want to hand the baton back to our crew?
[1:47:10.000 --> 1:47:11.000]  All right, run on in here.
[1:47:11.000 --> 1:47:12.000]  Come on in.
[1:47:12.000 --> 1:47:15.000]  I'm a college student.
[1:47:15.000 --> 1:47:19.000]  I just want to say it's been incredible to watch how much the political landscape
[1:47:19.000 --> 1:47:22.000]  has changed in the last couple of months.
[1:47:22.000 --> 1:47:26.900]  Just being able to express yourself has been something that we've been unable to
[1:47:26.900 --> 1:47:31.720]  do because as soon as you say something, you're labeled, you're attacked.
[1:47:31.720 --> 1:47:37.480]  And it's a way of controlling our speech and it's a way of controlling us.
[1:47:37.480 --> 1:47:41.600]  And it's just been amazing to see that shift change and it's important that young people
[1:47:41.600 --> 1:47:42.600]  start to get involved.
[1:47:42.600 --> 1:47:47.600]  And we start fighting back against this political correctness that has completely destroyed
[1:47:47.600 --> 1:47:48.600]  academia.
[1:47:48.600 --> 1:47:51.000]  I mean, it's been, it's been another nightmare.
[1:47:51.000 --> 1:47:53.200]  It's just, it's been destroying pretty thought-absolute.
[1:47:53.200 --> 1:47:56.760]  Well, and it's important that we start fighting back because that's all we have.
[1:47:56.760 --> 1:48:01.680]  We need to be autonomous and independent and we need to think analytically and critically.
[1:48:01.680 --> 1:48:03.480]  And if we do that, we'll be more informed.
[1:48:03.480 --> 1:48:04.480]  Hey, I love you guys.
[1:48:04.480 --> 1:48:05.480]  I got to roll out.
[1:48:05.480 --> 1:48:06.480]  Thank you so much.
[1:48:06.480 --> 1:48:07.480]  Thank you so much.
[1:48:07.480 --> 1:48:08.480]  Great job.
[1:48:08.480 --> 1:48:09.480]  Come on in.
[1:48:09.480 --> 1:48:10.480]  All right, anybody else want to say something?
[1:48:10.480 --> 1:48:11.480]  I just want to say one thing real quick.
[1:48:11.480 --> 1:48:12.480]  Go ahead.
[1:48:12.480 --> 1:48:14.640]  Montgomery County, Pennsylvania, Southeast Regional Office.
[1:48:14.640 --> 1:48:18.240]  And I worked against the GOP to support Trump.
[1:48:18.240 --> 1:48:22.920]  There are a lot of people that were just not on board for Trump where I work and it was
[1:48:22.920 --> 1:48:23.920]  all volunteer.
[1:48:23.920 --> 1:48:26.920]  I work for the grassroots Pennsylvania, so.
[1:48:26.920 --> 1:48:27.920]  Good job.
[1:48:27.920 --> 1:48:28.920]  My PA for Trump.
[1:48:28.920 --> 1:48:29.920]  Yay.
[1:48:29.920 --> 1:48:30.920]  All right.
[1:48:30.920 --> 1:48:31.920]  Thank you.
[1:48:31.920 --> 1:48:32.920]  Anybody else want to talk?
[1:48:32.920 --> 1:48:33.920]  I had to work against people in their own party.
[1:48:33.920 --> 1:48:34.920]  Come on up.
[1:48:34.920 --> 1:48:35.920]  Oh, yeah.
[1:48:35.920 --> 1:48:36.920]  Well, continue after you.
[1:48:36.920 --> 1:48:37.920]  How's it going?
[1:48:37.920 --> 1:48:38.920]  This is Glenn Zarmanov reporting live from Washington, D.C.
[1:48:38.920 --> 1:48:41.800]  We are changing New Jersey, Jersey City for 9-Eleven Truth.
[1:48:41.800 --> 1:48:45.480]  I've been in the Info War since 2001 since I found Alex Jones.
[1:48:45.480 --> 1:48:48.480]  Of course, I was already awake to 9-Eleven Truth before that because I'm a 9-Eleven
[1:48:48.480 --> 1:48:49.480]  eyewitness.
[1:48:49.480 --> 1:48:55.080]  So you can please check out my YouTube channel, Glenn Zarmanov, G-L-E-N-N-Z-A-R-M-A-N-O-V,
[1:48:55.080 --> 1:49:00.360]  and you can find the five terabytes that came out in 2000 and test declassified from NIST
[1:49:00.360 --> 1:49:06.120]  that they withheld intentionally, 5,000 gigabytes of previously kept secret videos and photos
[1:49:06.120 --> 1:49:09.520]  from 9-Eleven that proved the whole thing as an inside job.
[1:49:09.520 --> 1:49:13.280]  Before we had speculation and conjecture, now we have five terabytes.
[1:49:13.280 --> 1:49:14.280]  Please check it out.
[1:49:14.280 --> 1:49:15.280]  Glenn Zarmanov.
[1:49:15.280 --> 1:49:16.280]  Thanks, Glenn.
[1:49:16.280 --> 1:49:17.280]  Thanks.
[1:49:17.280 --> 1:49:18.280]  Hey, guys.
[1:49:18.280 --> 1:49:21.720]  I've got some batteries for maybe like two more people and then we'll have to end it.
[1:49:21.720 --> 1:49:23.560]  But here's another fine fella who came up.
[1:49:23.560 --> 1:49:24.560]  Here you go, sir.
[1:49:24.560 --> 1:49:25.560]  Oh, hi.
[1:49:25.560 --> 1:49:26.560]  I'm Will Cody.
[1:49:26.560 --> 1:49:28.280]  I was just walking down there from the rally, right?
[1:49:28.280 --> 1:49:29.280]  Coming over here.
[1:49:29.280 --> 1:49:33.280]  And these like, these Antifa guys are, I don't know what, they're like, they're wearing black,
[1:49:33.280 --> 1:49:35.960]  like bandanas on, you know, all black.
[1:49:35.960 --> 1:49:39.360]  They're carrying a big flag, like a hammer and sickle on it, and they like, they spit
[1:49:39.360 --> 1:49:40.360]  on me, like.
[1:49:40.360 --> 1:49:41.360]  Yeah.
[1:49:41.360 --> 1:49:42.360]  That's just terrible.
[1:49:42.360 --> 1:49:43.360]  Like, they're all radicalized there.
[1:49:43.360 --> 1:49:44.360]  People are just terrible.
[1:49:44.360 --> 1:49:45.360]  You're disgusting.
[1:49:45.360 --> 1:49:46.360]  All right, man.
[1:49:46.360 --> 1:49:47.360]  Thanks a lot.
[1:49:47.360 --> 1:49:48.360]  Thanks.
[1:49:48.360 --> 1:49:52.200]  It looks like the crowd has dissipated as soon as Alex Jones walked off.
[1:49:52.200 --> 1:49:54.600]  And so I'm going to throw it back to you guys.
[1:49:54.600 --> 1:49:58.480]  I'm running low on battery anyways is Rob do reporting from just outside the capitals
[1:49:58.480 --> 1:49:59.480]  right over there.
[1:49:59.480 --> 1:50:02.720]  And that's where they swore in Donald Trump as the 45th president of the United States.
[1:50:02.720 --> 1:50:03.720]  Hey, do you want to say anything?
[1:50:03.720 --> 1:50:05.760]  Close it out.
[1:50:05.760 --> 1:50:07.260]  Info wars.
[1:50:07.260 --> 1:50:10.960]  The info warriors are out in force today.
[1:50:10.960 --> 1:50:20.360]  It's great to be here with like minded people walking around, just the energy is incredible.
[1:50:20.360 --> 1:50:23.960]  Don't get nervous, don't get nervous.
[1:50:23.960 --> 1:50:24.960]  I'm speechless.
[1:50:24.960 --> 1:50:25.960]  I really, I can't.
[1:50:25.960 --> 1:50:26.960]  Give me a good laugh.
[1:50:26.960 --> 1:50:27.960]  I hope I wasn't too obnoxious.
[1:50:27.960 --> 1:50:28.960]  I'm at this guy last night outside the deplorable.
[1:50:28.960 --> 1:50:29.960]  Anyway, I'm going to swing this around.
[1:50:29.960 --> 1:50:43.600]  Well, do go get some battery power because I can't wait to hear all about what happened
[1:50:43.600 --> 1:50:44.600]  last night at the deplorable.
[1:50:44.600 --> 1:50:48.960]  So, yeah, I didn't quite make it in, but I did get some stuff outside.
[1:50:48.960 --> 1:50:49.960]  It was interesting.
[1:50:49.960 --> 1:50:50.960]  Talk to a lot of people who are victims.
[1:50:50.960 --> 1:50:51.960]  I get McGinnis.
[1:50:51.960 --> 1:50:53.960]  Do you have a very short cameraman?
[1:50:53.960 --> 1:51:00.960]  He's not looking at the right shot.
[1:51:00.960 --> 1:51:01.960]  There you go.
[1:51:01.960 --> 1:51:03.960]  I have two cameras going at once.
[1:51:03.960 --> 1:51:04.960]  The warhammers.
[1:51:04.960 --> 1:51:05.960]  Actually, I have three.
[1:51:05.960 --> 1:51:06.960]  I have a 360 camera going as well.
[1:51:06.960 --> 1:51:07.960]  So, I just took out my earpiece.
[1:51:07.960 --> 1:51:08.960]  I can't hear you.
[1:51:08.960 --> 1:51:11.960]  I'm going to throw it back to the Central Texas Command Center.
[1:51:11.960 --> 1:51:16.760]  This has been Rob do Alex Jones and a whole host of other good hearted patriots here of
[1:51:16.760 --> 1:51:21.560]  every race, color and creed here in Washington, DC, the nation's capital watching Donald Trump
[1:51:21.560 --> 1:51:25.280]  become the 45th president of the United States and let's MAGA out there, people.
[1:51:25.280 --> 1:51:26.280]  We'll see you next time.
[1:51:26.280 --> 1:51:27.280]  And we'll be right back.
[1:51:27.280 --> 1:51:28.280]  Stay with us.
[1:51:28.280 --> 1:51:34.560]  In these uncertain times, it makes sense to have a sustainable backup method to cook
[1:51:34.560 --> 1:51:35.760]  food and boil water.
[1:51:35.760 --> 1:51:40.160]  If your current plan includes using a fuel burning stove or cooking over an open fire,
[1:51:40.160 --> 1:51:41.640]  then there's a much better way.
[1:51:41.640 --> 1:51:46.480]  The Minuteman rocket stove is a biomass burning cooking stove that only requires small quantities
[1:51:46.480 --> 1:51:48.160]  of sticks and twigs for fuel.
[1:51:48.160 --> 1:51:52.200]  The Minuteman stove is easy to use, smokeless, portable, powerful and sustainable.
[1:51:52.200 --> 1:51:56.800]  For the finest in survival cooking stoves and fire starters made right here in the USA,

[1:52:28.400 --> 1:52:30.560]  Come and take it.
[1:52:30.560 --> 1:52:33.120]  Taking turmeric is good, but there's a problem with it.
[1:52:33.120 --> 1:52:37.280]  The active ingredient in turmeric known as curcumin is poorly absorbed into the cells
[1:52:37.280 --> 1:52:39.080]  due to its large particle size.
[1:52:39.080 --> 1:52:43.840]  But now one planet nutrition has the answer for this powerful anti-inflammatory.
[1:52:43.840 --> 1:52:49.200]  Curcumin, a nanoparticle curcumin which absorbs over 40 times better into your bloodstream.

[1:54:38.440 --> 1:54:39.440]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[1:54:39.440 --> 1:54:41.160]  I'm David Knight with Leanne McAdoo.
[1:54:41.160 --> 1:54:46.040]  We're here in Austin and of course you just saw Alex Jones with the crowd in Washington,
[1:54:46.040 --> 1:54:47.040]  DC.
[1:54:47.040 --> 1:54:52.480]  We have our reporters Rob Dew and others are there in Washington covering the inauguration
[1:54:52.480 --> 1:54:57.640]  of President Donald J. Trump and of course he was sworn in at noon Eastern time.
[1:54:57.640 --> 1:55:01.360]  We're going to play that for you at the top of the hour again in case you missed that.
[1:55:01.360 --> 1:55:05.840]  It's now the 45th president and we saw these pictures of Donald Trump signing all these
[1:55:05.840 --> 1:55:07.640]  papers and kept saying what is he doing?
[1:55:07.640 --> 1:55:09.200]  Is he signing executive orders or whatever?
[1:55:09.200 --> 1:55:13.840]  He had said he was going to sign quote some very meaningful documents unquote and it looked
[1:55:13.840 --> 1:55:18.160]  like he was going through a real estate signing, buying a house, something that Donald Trump
[1:55:18.160 --> 1:55:21.200]  is certainly no stranger to but it was more significant than that.
[1:55:21.200 --> 1:55:27.120]  From what we understand at least one of those documents was to allow General Mattis to become
[1:55:27.120 --> 1:55:31.880]  Secretary of Defense because there was a delay on that.
[1:55:31.880 --> 1:55:36.480]  He had not been out of the Army for the requisite amount of time so they changed the law.
[1:55:36.480 --> 1:55:39.960]  Donald Trump has now signed that so it clears away for General Mattis.
[1:55:39.960 --> 1:55:44.400]  Now before we go back and cover some more of what is happening on site, I just want
[1:55:44.400 --> 1:55:51.000]  to remind you that we have an exclusive limited edition lithograph of President Trump.
[1:55:51.000 --> 1:55:56.600]  This is 16 by 20, it's just 1995 and you can see a picture of this on the site.
[1:55:56.600 --> 1:56:02.480]  This is the official RNC portrait artist, the same guy who did that iconic drawing of Ronald
[1:56:02.480 --> 1:56:03.480]  Reagan in the cowboy hat.
[1:56:03.480 --> 1:56:08.640]  It's a very detailed, we have this framed here in the hallway at the office.
[1:56:08.640 --> 1:56:14.760]  It is a very beautiful, very detailed portrait of Donald Trump and you can find that 1995
[1:56:14.760 --> 1:56:22.720]  limited edition exclusively at InfoWarsStore.com, also we still have our Make America Healthy
[1:56:22.720 --> 1:56:25.400]  again, I guess we could call it, our 2017-

[1:57:08.880 --> 1:57:14.800]  You never know, it doesn't have to be a catastrophe, a political or geopolitical catastrophe to
[1:57:14.800 --> 1:57:16.160]  need storeable food.
[1:57:16.160 --> 1:57:20.400]  Just look at what happened with the winter storms we saw this last week, the empty shelves.
[1:57:20.400 --> 1:57:24.920]  That's something that you can also do to level out the price of your food.
[1:57:24.920 --> 1:57:28.920]  We may have price surges at various times, or the price of food may go up.
[1:57:28.920 --> 1:57:31.680]  These last for 25 years.
[1:57:31.680 --> 1:57:37.120]  Made in America, no GMO, great packaging and you can reseal that once you open it again.
[1:57:37.120 --> 1:57:40.800]  Take a look at our offerings there for InfoWars Select Storeable Food.
[1:57:40.800 --> 1:57:43.800]  They are now discounted 30 to 40% off.
[1:57:43.800 --> 1:57:48.120]  That's the way you can support us, support our crew as we go to cover these events like
[1:57:48.120 --> 1:57:52.840]  we have Alex Jones and the rest of our reporters in Washington DC.
[1:57:52.840 --> 1:57:56.360]  Leigh Ann, we've got the Director's Guild of America and of course we had one of the
[1:57:56.360 --> 1:58:00.480]  people that they were talking to in the crowd there, who was a college student, and said
[1:58:00.480 --> 1:58:06.320]  it was great that Donald Trump had opened things up so that he had shut down the political
[1:58:06.320 --> 1:58:08.320]  correctness, which is really nothing but censorship.
[1:58:08.320 --> 1:58:12.560]  We see an example of this with the Director's Guild of America sending around an email and
[1:58:12.560 --> 1:58:15.440]  saying somebody is bullying and threatening us over Donald Trump.
[1:58:15.440 --> 1:58:17.400]  This is neo McCarthyism.
[1:58:17.400 --> 1:58:18.800]  This is political correctness.
[1:58:18.800 --> 1:58:23.840]  These are the neo cold warriors, like you see Robert De Niro pushing to say we're gonna
[1:58:23.840 --> 1:58:25.000]  shut this guy down.
[1:58:25.000 --> 1:58:26.360]  We gotta come after Trump.
[1:58:26.360 --> 1:58:27.360]  Trump is a bully.
[1:58:27.360 --> 1:58:29.000]  He's a raging bull and so forth.
[1:58:29.000 --> 1:58:31.240]  These are people who want war.
[1:58:31.240 --> 1:58:32.840]  Let's just call it for what it is.
[1:58:32.840 --> 1:58:33.840]  They want war.
[1:58:33.840 --> 1:58:34.840]  They're pushing for war.
[1:58:34.840 --> 1:58:36.560]  They're pushing for a cold war.
[1:58:36.560 --> 1:58:39.800]  Absolutely irresponsible to see these people who all their lives have been telling us,
[1:58:39.800 --> 1:58:41.760]  no, we don't want war.
[1:58:41.760 --> 1:58:46.200]  Backing this president who gave us seven wars and a new cold war.
[1:58:46.200 --> 1:58:50.760]  No, well, and obviously people at CNN got the memo because they like to put the side-by-side
[1:58:50.760 --> 1:58:51.760]  photos.
[1:58:51.760 --> 1:58:56.000]  Boy, he's campaigned on his large crowds but seems to be smaller than his predecessor
[1:58:56.000 --> 1:58:59.320]  and of course they're using photos from eight o'clock this morning.
[1:58:59.320 --> 1:59:00.320]  I mean, it's just...
[1:59:00.320 --> 1:59:01.800]  Yeah, we're gonna be right back.
[1:59:01.800 --> 1:59:03.200]  We're gonna have to replay for you.
[1:59:03.200 --> 1:59:04.360]  Donald Trump being sworn in.
[1:59:04.360 --> 1:59:07.640]  I guess in Hollywood, black lists matter, don't they?
[1:59:07.640 --> 1:59:08.640]  That's what they're gonna come after.
[1:59:08.640 --> 1:59:09.640]  We'll be right back.
[1:59:09.640 --> 1:59:14.640]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[1:59:14.640 --> 1:59:20.640]  Visit GCNLive.com today.
[1:59:20.640 --> 1:59:24.640]  Ladies and gentlemen, Alex Jones here on the road with a very important announcement.
[1:59:24.640 --> 1:59:29.240]  Roger Stone's new book that is coming out in a couple of weeks is exclusively available
[1:59:29.240 --> 1:59:32.360]  at pre-order at infowarsstore.com.
[1:59:32.360 --> 1:59:36.040]  It's the making of a president and it breaks down how Trump really got elected.
[1:59:36.040 --> 1:59:40.160]  The inside baseball, the current battles, and a blueprint for the future of what Trump
[1:59:40.160 --> 1:59:43.360]  and others are really planning to do to restore the Republican prosperity.
[1:59:43.360 --> 1:59:47.200]  The bottom line, this is the book that got Roger Stone poisoned with polonium.
[1:59:47.200 --> 1:59:50.560]  It breaks down what really happened with the Russians and so much more and it supports
[1:59:50.560 --> 1:59:53.520]  him and it supports info wars and our whole operation.
[1:59:53.520 --> 1:59:56.920]  So it's essential that this book go to the top of the charts in the political area if
[1:59:56.920 --> 1:59:58.360]  not to the very top of the charts.
[1:59:58.360 --> 2:00:01.320]  Joe Biden has come out and said world government is collapsing.
[2:00:01.320 --> 2:00:03.080]  They're in full crisis mode.
[2:00:03.080 --> 2:00:04.680]  Nationals movements are exploding.
[2:00:04.680 --> 2:00:08.680]  Everybody needs to go pre-order so you get it first at infowarsstore.com.
[2:00:08.680 --> 2:00:10.760]  The making of a president by Roger Stone.
[2:00:10.760 --> 2:00:11.760]  I'm Alex Jones.
[2:00:11.760 --> 2:00:14.120]  I'm going on airplane to go to the inaugural event with Trump.
[2:00:14.120 --> 2:00:18.160]  Pray for us and please continue to support the operation and get his book now so you're
[2:00:18.160 --> 2:00:22.560]  the first to have a trip to you.
[2:00:22.560 --> 2:00:50.360]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:00:50.360 --> 2:01:10.240]  Everyone please stand.
[2:01:10.240 --> 2:01:13.920]  Please raise your right hand and repeat after me.
[2:01:13.920 --> 2:01:17.560]  I Donald John Trump do solemnly swear.
[2:01:17.560 --> 2:01:20.880]  I Donald John Trump do solemnly swear.
[2:01:20.880 --> 2:01:23.900]  That I will faithfully execute.
[2:01:23.900 --> 2:01:26.360]  That I will faithfully execute.
[2:01:26.360 --> 2:01:29.460]  The office of President of the United States.
[2:01:29.460 --> 2:01:32.920]  The office of President of the United States.
[2:01:32.920 --> 2:01:35.380]  And will to the best of my ability.
[2:01:35.380 --> 2:01:38.340]  And Will to the best of my ability.
[2:01:38.340 --> 2:01:40.480]  Preserve protect and defend.
[2:01:40.480 --> 2:01:42.520]  Preserve protect and defend.
[2:01:42.520 --> 2:01:44.640]  The Constitution of the United States.
[2:01:44.640 --> 2:01:46.880]  The Constitution of the United States.
[2:01:46.880 --> 2:01:50.880]  So help me God. So help me God. Congratulations, Mr. President.
[2:02:46.880 --> 2:03:09.880]  What a great honor to be able to introduce for the first time ever anywhere the 45th President of the United States of America, Donald J. Trump.
[2:03:35.880 --> 2:03:42.880]  Chief Justice Roberts, President Carter, President Clinton, President Bush,
[2:03:42.880 --> 2:03:50.880]  President Obama, fellow Americans, and people of the world, thank you.
[2:03:55.880 --> 2:04:10.880]  We, the citizens of America, are now joined in a great national effort to rebuild our country and restore its promise for all of our people.
[2:04:10.880 --> 2:04:20.880]  Together we will determine the course of America and the world for many, many years to come.
[2:04:20.880 --> 2:04:28.880]  We will face challenges. We will confront hardships. But we will get the job done.
[2:04:28.880 --> 2:04:36.880]  Every four years we gather on these steps to carry out the orderly and peaceful transfer of power.
[2:04:36.880 --> 2:04:48.880]  And we are grateful to President Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama for their gracious aid throughout this transition.
[2:04:48.880 --> 2:04:52.880]  They have been magnificent. Thank you.
[2:04:52.880 --> 2:05:11.880]  Thank you. Today's ceremony, however, has very special meaning, because today we are not merely transferring power from one administration to another,
[2:05:11.880 --> 2:05:22.880]  or from one party to another, but we are transferring power from Washington D.C. and giving it back to you, the people.
[2:05:22.880 --> 2:05:37.880]  All the perplexities, the confusion and distress in America arise not from objects in their constitution or confederation,
[2:05:37.880 --> 2:05:44.880]  not from want of honor or virtue, so much as from the downright ignorance of the nature of coin, credit, and circulation.
[2:05:44.880 --> 2:05:48.880]  Those are the words of John Adams, the second president of the United States.
[2:05:48.880 --> 2:05:54.880]  Are you ignorant of the private Federal Reserve? Do you understand the nature of our fiat currency?
[2:05:54.880 --> 2:06:00.880]  Do you understand how a private corporation has the ability to create boom and bust cycles and to profit from it?
[2:06:00.880 --> 2:06:05.880]  What kind of leverage do these people and the Federal Reserve have over the American people?
[2:06:05.880 --> 2:06:09.880]  Or for that matter, what kind of leverage do the Saudis have over our money?
[2:06:09.880 --> 2:06:12.880]  Will you be a slave or will you be free?
[2:06:12.880 --> 2:06:17.880]  Adams also said liberty cannot be preserved without general knowledge among the people.

[2:08:45.880 --> 2:08:54.880]  It's Alex Jones.
[2:08:54.880 --> 2:08:55.880]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[2:08:55.880 --> 2:09:01.880]  I'm David Knight with Leanne McAdoo, Darren McBreen, and Margaret Howell are joining us in the other studio in just a moment.
[2:09:01.880 --> 2:09:02.880]  Of course, we're all here in Austin.
[2:09:02.880 --> 2:09:08.880]  We have a lot of InfoWars crew, including Alex Jones, as you've just seen in the last hour.
[2:09:08.880 --> 2:09:14.880]  Alex was there at the inauguration, was inside the inauguration, and then he talked to the crowd outside afterwards.
[2:09:14.880 --> 2:09:17.880]  Some great comments from the people there in the crowd.
[2:09:17.880 --> 2:09:24.880]  And now we have protesters are evidently have been triggered by the inauguration of Donald Trump.
[2:09:24.880 --> 2:09:25.880]  We've got some live footage here.
[2:09:25.880 --> 2:09:27.880]  They're already flashing with police.
[2:09:27.880 --> 2:09:32.880]  This is Fox News showing tear gas being fired at people and protesters attacking people.
[2:09:32.880 --> 2:09:38.880]  Because, you know, we cannot have a peaceful transition of power if these brats don't get their way.
[2:09:38.880 --> 2:09:39.880]  They do whatever they want.
[2:09:39.880 --> 2:09:40.880]  These are the children of Obama.
[2:09:40.880 --> 2:09:44.880]  These are people who, like Obama, don't respect the democratic process.
[2:09:44.880 --> 2:09:47.880]  They don't get what he wanted from our elected representative.
[2:09:47.880 --> 2:09:48.880]  So he just did executive orders.
[2:09:48.880 --> 2:09:50.880]  These people don't get what they want out of the election.
[2:09:50.880 --> 2:09:51.880]  It's what they do.
[2:09:51.880 --> 2:09:52.880]  They take to the streets.
[2:09:52.880 --> 2:09:54.880]  They attack people and call it free speech.
[2:09:54.880 --> 2:09:55.880]  No, it's not.
[2:09:55.880 --> 2:09:56.880]  Let's call it what it is.
[2:09:56.880 --> 2:09:57.880]  Okay.
[2:09:57.880 --> 2:09:59.880]  They're setting fire to a crowded theater.
[2:09:59.880 --> 2:10:02.880]  This is what these people are doing, and they need to be shut down.
[2:10:02.880 --> 2:10:04.880]  And so this is back and forth.
[2:10:04.880 --> 2:10:05.880]  Tear gas canisters being thrown.
[2:10:05.880 --> 2:10:08.880]  Protesters just threw it back at the police there.
[2:10:08.880 --> 2:10:11.880]  I guess they deployed some to disperse the crowd.
[2:10:11.880 --> 2:10:14.880]  But obviously things are already getting wild.
[2:10:14.880 --> 2:10:20.880]  The parade hasn't even started, and they had been planning these protests to go all along the parade route today.
[2:10:20.880 --> 2:10:26.880]  Of course, there's about 8,000 people participating in this parade with all of these Antifa people here on the sides.
[2:10:26.880 --> 2:10:31.880]  And of course, Donald Trump said he was going to be getting the power back to the people, but I don't think he meant these people.
[2:10:31.880 --> 2:10:37.880]  The key thing, and this is a report that's up on infowars.com, and we're going to show you this clip of this in just a moment.
[2:10:37.880 --> 2:10:44.880]  Alex Jones said what they're doing here is the DC police who are really under the control of President Obama.
[2:10:44.880 --> 2:10:49.880]  These people have been standing down and allowing this to happen with the protesters.
[2:10:49.880 --> 2:10:51.880]  And that's what you need to understand.
[2:10:51.880 --> 2:10:55.880]  They have taken a non-confrontational viewpoint to allow this to happen.
[2:10:55.880 --> 2:10:56.880]  They want this to happen.
[2:10:56.880 --> 2:10:59.880]  The mainstream media is going to run with this and say, look at this.
[2:10:59.880 --> 2:11:00.880]  We have a divided America.
[2:11:00.880 --> 2:11:02.880]  Civil war has broken out.
[2:11:02.880 --> 2:11:03.880]  This is not a legitimate president.
[2:11:03.880 --> 2:11:07.880]  With all the stuff that we've been hearing, that's the narrative that they want you to see.
[2:11:07.880 --> 2:11:08.880]  This is what they want to have happen.
[2:11:08.880 --> 2:11:11.880]  That's why Obama allowed this to happen.
[2:11:11.880 --> 2:11:17.880]  And the report we have up on infowars.com is police allow BLM to attack women at the Trump inauguration.
[2:11:17.880 --> 2:11:25.880]  Of course, we've seen not only rain, but we've seen the police in DC allow the free reign of Black Lives Matter.
[2:11:25.880 --> 2:11:31.880]  And you've got an article here where you got an example of how the mainstream press is trying to create a narrative saying,
[2:11:31.880 --> 2:11:34.880]  look, nobody showed up for Donald Trump's inauguration.
[2:11:34.880 --> 2:11:35.880]  Such a divided country here.
[2:11:35.880 --> 2:11:39.880]  People, you know, what a difference it is between him and President Obama.
[2:11:39.880 --> 2:11:42.880]  I mentioned this earlier with the optics that the media is trying to use.
[2:11:42.880 --> 2:11:47.880]  So here's, this is CNN, if you guys can get this picture here on this iPad.
[2:11:47.880 --> 2:11:51.880]  So they say the inaugural crowds, Trumps versus Obama's.
[2:11:51.880 --> 2:11:58.880]  He campaigned on the huge crowd sizes, but the turnout for President Trump's inauguration appears to be smaller than that of his predecessor.
[2:11:58.880 --> 2:12:09.880]  And so they're using a photograph from early this morning before the crowd was even there versus this is probably when the actual
[2:12:09.880 --> 2:12:11.880]  Obama's inauguration was going on.
[2:12:11.880 --> 2:12:14.880]  So they're going to just let this fake news roll out.
[2:12:14.880 --> 2:12:18.880]  And we all saw with our own eyes as the inauguration was happening with Donald Trump.
[2:12:18.880 --> 2:12:19.880]  This place was packed.
[2:12:19.880 --> 2:12:26.880]  But this is what CNN fake news is saying the inauguration look like because people are so against public enemy.
[2:12:26.880 --> 2:12:28.880]  Number one, President Donald Trump.
[2:12:28.880 --> 2:12:35.880]  And of course, as you, as we began the program, we were talking about the glowing terms in which the mainstream media was describing.
[2:12:35.880 --> 2:12:37.880]  Obama's inauguration eight years ago.
[2:12:37.880 --> 2:12:40.880]  They're talking about the beautiful weather, how unseasonably warm it was, et cetera, et cetera.
[2:12:40.880 --> 2:12:41.880]  So this is against the weather.
[2:12:41.880 --> 2:12:49.880]  This is against the Black Lives Matter people who have been allowed to shut down the entrances, getting into the inauguration area as well.
[2:12:49.880 --> 2:12:52.880]  And so they create all of this and then come out with their scene.
[2:12:52.880 --> 2:12:53.880]  We told you so.
[2:12:53.880 --> 2:12:53.880]  Yeah.
[2:12:53.880 --> 2:12:54.880]  And nobody showed up.
[2:12:54.880 --> 2:12:55.880]  That's not true.
[2:12:55.880 --> 2:12:57.880]  Hillary won the popular vote.
[2:12:57.880 --> 2:13:00.880]  I want to play this clip that we have as part of this article.
[2:13:00.880 --> 2:13:08.880]  This is from our crew and Alex Jones in Washington, DC, showing how Black Lives Matter was allowed to attack women.
[2:13:08.880 --> 2:13:13.880]  Showing how the police have stood down to allow this to happen.
[2:13:13.880 --> 2:13:15.880]  Here's that clip from Alex Jones and crew.
[2:13:15.880 --> 2:13:26.880]  I pulled myself up by his testicles.
[2:13:26.880 --> 2:13:31.880]  Okay, the leftists, now they are blocking the gates.
[2:13:31.880 --> 2:13:34.880]  And ma'am, tell folks who you are and what happened to you.
[2:13:34.880 --> 2:13:35.880]  I'm Shannon Martinez.
[2:13:35.880 --> 2:13:37.880]  I was trying to get in the gate back there.
[2:13:37.880 --> 2:13:39.880]  I went to cross the line.
[2:13:39.880 --> 2:13:41.880]  As you can see, I have a cane.
[2:13:41.880 --> 2:13:42.880]  I'm RSD.
[2:13:42.880 --> 2:13:43.880]  They yanked me to the ground.
[2:13:43.880 --> 2:13:44.880]  Who did?
[2:13:44.880 --> 2:13:45.880]  They started kicking me.
[2:13:45.880 --> 2:13:46.880]  The protesters.
[2:13:46.880 --> 2:13:47.880]  They started kicking me.
[2:13:47.880 --> 2:13:50.880]  I got kicked in the face and a grown man kicked me twice in the chest.
[2:13:50.880 --> 2:13:52.880]  The only thing that saved me was my motorcycle.
[2:13:52.880 --> 2:13:53.880]  Do they get arrested?
[2:13:53.880 --> 2:13:54.880]  No.
[2:13:54.880 --> 2:13:55.880]  The police were standing there.
[2:13:55.880 --> 2:14:00.880]  When I got up and was crying, the police literally turned their back to me.
[2:14:00.880 --> 2:14:03.880]  The reporters were the ones that asked if I was okay.
[2:14:03.880 --> 2:14:05.880]  Where are these protesters?
[2:14:05.880 --> 2:14:07.880]  The Black Lives Matter is over.
[2:14:07.880 --> 2:14:08.880]  Are they still there right now?
[2:14:08.880 --> 2:14:09.880]  Yes.
[2:14:09.880 --> 2:14:14.880]  John Marshall Park is the entrance to John Marshall Park.
[2:14:14.880 --> 2:14:15.880]  And they attacked you?
[2:14:15.880 --> 2:14:16.880]  They attacked me.
[2:14:16.880 --> 2:14:17.880]  They attacked everyone.
[2:14:17.880 --> 2:14:21.880]  They literally yanked me to the ground, took my cane and started kicking me.
[2:14:21.880 --> 2:14:24.880]  And for the sake of honesty, I think that's the only gate they were blocking.
[2:14:24.880 --> 2:14:25.880]  I didn't see them.
[2:14:25.880 --> 2:14:26.880]  They blocked the steps.
[2:14:26.880 --> 2:14:27.880]  They blocked the steps.
[2:14:27.880 --> 2:14:28.880]  They blocked the steps.
[2:14:28.880 --> 2:14:29.880]  She's here.
[2:14:29.880 --> 2:14:30.880]  She's here.
[2:14:30.880 --> 2:14:31.880]  Did the guys go to the phone?
[2:14:31.880 --> 2:14:32.880]  We got a great president.
[2:14:32.880 --> 2:14:33.880]  Well, hey, in a little while.
[2:14:33.880 --> 2:14:34.880]  It's all up.
[2:14:34.880 --> 2:14:35.880]  In a little while.
[2:14:35.880 --> 2:14:37.880]  Okay, I'm going out in a minute.
[2:14:37.880 --> 2:14:38.880]  Yeah.
[2:14:38.880 --> 2:14:39.880]  Yeah, come on.
[2:14:39.880 --> 2:14:40.880]  Nice to meet you.
[2:14:40.880 --> 2:14:41.880]  Yeah, nice to meet you.
[2:14:41.880 --> 2:14:42.880]  Nice to meet you.
[2:14:42.880 --> 2:14:43.880]  How about you, Ron?
[2:14:43.880 --> 2:14:44.880]  Hey, Alex.
[2:14:44.880 --> 2:14:45.880]  Hey, folks, anything you want to say?
[2:14:45.880 --> 2:14:46.880]  Get it on TV right here.
[2:14:46.880 --> 2:14:47.880]  They're going to stop you real quick.
[2:14:47.880 --> 2:14:48.880]  Yes, sir.
[2:14:48.880 --> 2:14:49.880]  Let's do it.
[2:14:49.880 --> 2:14:50.880]  Right here.
[2:14:50.880 --> 2:14:51.880]  Let me just plug for my Facebook, though.
[2:14:51.880 --> 2:14:52.880]  Thatjourseygirl.com.
[2:14:52.880 --> 2:14:53.880]  Thatjourseygirl.com.
[2:14:53.880 --> 2:14:54.880]  My bad.
[2:14:54.880 --> 2:14:55.880]  That about R&D.
[2:14:55.880 --> 2:14:56.880]  Let me get a photo.
[2:14:56.880 --> 2:15:05.880]  I want to say thank you, Mr. Trump, for taking the risk for us and trying to make this country
[2:15:05.880 --> 2:15:08.880]  great, I believe in you, and I believe God will lead you.
[2:15:08.880 --> 2:15:09.880]  Get that wall up.
[2:15:09.880 --> 2:15:15.880]  Get that middle-class private industry rolling, and God bless America.
[2:15:15.880 --> 2:15:18.880]  And I thank Mr. Jones for all that he does.
[2:15:18.880 --> 2:15:19.880]  I am forever grateful.
[2:15:19.880 --> 2:15:20.880]  Hey, come on in here.
[2:15:20.880 --> 2:15:21.880]  I've been going for you.
[2:15:21.880 --> 2:15:22.880]  Here, what's your name?
[2:15:22.880 --> 2:15:23.880]  I'm Ciorella.
[2:15:23.880 --> 2:15:24.880]  Nice to meet you.
[2:15:24.880 --> 2:15:25.880]  Anyone take a picture for me?
[2:15:25.880 --> 2:15:26.880]  Wow, okay.
[2:15:26.880 --> 2:15:27.880]  Somebody else do it.
[2:15:27.880 --> 2:15:28.880]  Thank you.
[2:15:28.880 --> 2:15:29.880]  Thank you.
[2:15:29.880 --> 2:15:32.880]  God bless you, ma'am, for the sport.
[2:15:32.880 --> 2:15:38.880]  God bless you, sir.
[2:15:38.880 --> 2:15:40.880]  God bless you.
[2:15:40.880 --> 2:15:42.880]  God bless you.
[2:15:42.880 --> 2:15:45.880]  God bless you.
[2:15:45.880 --> 2:15:48.880]  Do you demand the sport shoes right here?
[2:15:48.880 --> 2:15:49.880]  Not really.
[2:15:49.880 --> 2:15:50.880]  Yeah, you did.
[2:15:50.880 --> 2:15:54.880]  I saw you interview David Gurg and that's what I got hooked on you.
[2:15:54.880 --> 2:15:55.880]  About...
[2:15:55.880 --> 2:15:58.880]  So, you heard Alex Jones doing a live report there.
[2:15:58.880 --> 2:15:59.880]  There was a small woman.
[2:15:59.880 --> 2:16:02.800]  She said a grown man knocked her to the ground, kicked her in the chest.
[2:16:02.800 --> 2:16:09.840]  in the face, the police stood by and did nothing. It was reporters who came to her aid. That's
[2:16:09.840 --> 2:16:13.600]  what we're being told. We're seeing that happen. And of course, you can see the massive number
[2:16:13.600 --> 2:16:19.120]  of protesters there being given free reign, Black Lives Matter. We've got some clips that Darren
[2:16:19.120 --> 2:16:23.360]  and Margaret have of some other things that are happening in Washington, DC. Tell us about that.
[2:16:24.640 --> 2:16:28.720]  Well, before we go to the clip, I just want to say that those protesters
[2:16:28.720 --> 2:16:34.240]  and the anti-Trump agitators, they're not part of the working-class heroes of America.
[2:16:34.240 --> 2:16:39.680]  Busy people right now, people that have saved up money and traveled for hundreds of miles. On the
[2:16:39.680 --> 2:16:44.240]  ground, they're the most respectful people. The people that love Trump, hard-working people,
[2:16:44.240 --> 2:16:48.640]  traveling hundreds of miles just to pay their respects to the inauguration. And then you've
[2:16:48.640 --> 2:16:55.840]  got these idiot freaks that have no respect for a woman who is disabled with a cane kissing her.
[2:16:55.840 --> 2:17:00.640]  They need to turn in their Obama phones for alarm clocks.
[2:17:02.400 --> 2:17:06.160]  I've read somewhere that there were these mobile police stations set up.
[2:17:06.160 --> 2:17:10.080]  Why aren't they using them? They're supposed to be on every corner, for instances like this,
[2:17:10.080 --> 2:17:14.480]  because you know what, Darren, in some cases, that's a felon. You can't beat up a woman and kick
[2:17:14.480 --> 2:17:19.680]  her on the floor. I mean, that's just a wow. And nationwide, whenever we go out to these
[2:17:19.680 --> 2:17:26.800]  anti-Trump rallies, it's the same talking points. F. Donald Trump, Nazi scum, go home,
[2:17:26.800 --> 2:17:32.960]  you homophobic, xenophobic bastards. And we're invading their territorial borders.
[2:17:34.240 --> 2:17:38.240]  David just called them brats. I thought, you know what, I could see somebody wanting to take
[2:17:38.240 --> 2:17:42.240]  them over their knee. Honestly, they need a good wallop, frankly.
[2:17:42.240 --> 2:17:45.920]  I just want to ask Jennings, do you have that clip ready?
[2:17:45.920 --> 2:17:52.800]  So, apparently, we have an urgent message from a liberal in distress, and we want to give everybody
[2:17:52.800 --> 2:17:57.840]  a platform. Everybody should have a voice here. So, let's listen to what this gentleman has to say.
[2:17:57.840 --> 2:18:01.920]  I think he got triggered, and he's very afraid right now. Let's check it out.
[2:18:06.720 --> 2:18:11.040]  Uh-oh. Can't hear it. Looks like we're not getting anything volume here on our side.
[2:18:11.040 --> 2:18:18.240]  Well, let's come back to that here in a minute. Isn't it just interesting though,
[2:18:18.240 --> 2:18:24.160]  the parade hasn't even begun. We're still about 45 minutes away from the parade,
[2:18:24.160 --> 2:18:28.960]  and they're already clashing with police. I think they said that at least 25 arrests have already
[2:18:29.600 --> 2:18:34.400]  been made. Meanwhile, we were looking at what Donald Trump was doing right now,
[2:18:34.400 --> 2:18:38.320]  and everybody else is partying, and you know, we sell a champagne bottle, start to open on the
[2:18:38.320 --> 2:18:43.440]  tables. He's signing an executive order at the moment that would allow General Mattis to assume
[2:18:43.440 --> 2:18:48.240]  that position because of the conflict. He's making sure that that doesn't happen. So,
[2:18:48.240 --> 2:18:54.640]  the man's already working, and we barely finish the inauguration. He has a list of day one pledges
[2:18:54.640 --> 2:18:59.680]  right from Donald Trump, and it's a tall order. It's a tall order. Repel Obamacare, build a wall,
[2:18:59.680 --> 2:19:06.080]  stop Syrian immigration, no more sanctuary cities, and delete all illegal executive actions that
[2:19:06.080 --> 2:19:10.240]  could take him all day. And of course, some of this stuff he can't do in the first day, but
[2:19:10.240 --> 2:19:14.800]  he's gonna get started, I promise you. He's gonna get the ball rolling. And if the progressives and
[2:19:14.800 --> 2:19:20.720]  the social justice warriors, if they hate Trump now, just wait until he makes good on all of his
[2:19:20.720 --> 2:19:25.440]  campaign promises. Right. I hope he can just stay focused on what he's promised and just,
[2:19:25.440 --> 2:19:30.320]  you know, take this 100 days to just do the work that he campaigned on and just ignore all of the
[2:19:30.320 --> 2:19:35.920]  craziness out on the streets, because we know it's just all optics. It's fake news, and I
[2:19:35.920 --> 2:19:39.680]  feel like everyone really needs to just ignore what's going out on there in the streets, because
[2:19:39.680 --> 2:19:44.240]  it's not real. It's not reality. Those people who are out there protesting, thinking that their
[2:19:44.240 --> 2:19:50.080]  civil rights are about to be ripped away, are not operating on reality. While they violate everybody
[2:19:50.080 --> 2:19:53.680]  else's civil rights. Exactly. Because they're worried about their own being taken away. They're
[2:19:53.680 --> 2:19:57.680]  gonna go beat on some people. And I think it's a blessing in disguise. Of course, I hate to see
[2:19:57.680 --> 2:20:01.600]  cities burned down, and I hate to see people with their First Amendment violated and all that. But
[2:20:01.600 --> 2:20:06.640]  the more these protesters act like this, the more recruits we get. People are waking up across the
[2:20:06.640 --> 2:20:11.280]  country. It's awesome to see. All right, stay with us. We're gonna take a quick break. I'm David

[2:22:32.800 --> 2:22:38.960]  I absolutely love One World Way. It was about five years ago when a trainer told me it was the
[2:22:38.960 --> 2:22:44.800]  end all of protein powder. One day when I ran out, I decided to try other brands. I spent eight
[2:22:44.800 --> 2:22:49.760]  months and could not find a replacement. I went through tons of brands, types, and flavors,
[2:22:49.760 --> 2:22:55.840]  and almost all of them tasted unnatural and not pleasant. When it all boiled down, I came right
[2:22:55.840 --> 2:23:02.000]  back to One World Way. I buy the cost effective five pound container and my family craves their One
[2:23:02.000 --> 2:23:08.560]  World Way too. I look forward to and enjoy having my One World Way and feel great after I drink it.
[2:23:08.560 --> 2:23:14.480]  Thank you, synergistic nutrition for perfecting a protein powder in the product One World Way

[2:24:54.960 --> 2:24:58.160]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show. I'm David Knight with Leanne McAdoo, Darren McBrain,
[2:24:58.160 --> 2:25:01.600]  Margaret Howell here in the studio, and of course our reporters in Washington. And now the
[2:25:02.320 --> 2:25:08.000]  devils have taken the mask off. They are confronting the police there. It's a large mass of protesters.
[2:25:08.000 --> 2:25:12.800]  After we've had situations earlier today as we reported, Alex Jones talked to a small woman
[2:25:12.800 --> 2:25:17.920]  with a cane who said she was knocked to the ground, kicked in the chest repeatedly by a large man,
[2:25:17.920 --> 2:25:22.560]  and the police stood by and did nothing. Now they are doing something. Now there is a massive
[2:25:22.560 --> 2:25:28.880]  movement of crowds, as you see here, with a live stream here in the area. They are moving against
[2:25:28.880 --> 2:25:34.480]  the police and the police are moving back against them. As we see these Obama supporters Leanne
[2:25:34.480 --> 2:25:40.080]  coming after people breaking and vandalizing cars, breaking windows, destroying businesses,
[2:25:40.720 --> 2:25:45.120]  these truly are Obama's supporters. I mean, that's what he's been doing to the entire economy
[2:25:45.120 --> 2:25:50.400]  for the last eight years. He's been vandalizing the American economy. And I think we're going
[2:25:50.400 --> 2:25:54.800]  to see that turn around. Certainly I think people have had enough of this. But understand that this
[2:25:54.800 --> 2:26:00.960]  law enforcement reaction that we see here, allowing the protesters to get a foothold there to do this,
[2:26:00.960 --> 2:26:04.880]  they all just said that they were joking, didn't they? Yeah, it was just a joke. They were just,
[2:26:04.880 --> 2:26:08.960]  they were only kidding, James O'Keefe. Well, and it's interesting because we, Margaret and I,
[2:26:08.960 --> 2:26:15.040]  actually talked about this, that there was a transfer of power there that the commander of
[2:26:15.040 --> 2:26:22.400]  the National Guard hands it over his power at 1201 once Donald Trump's was sworn in. So the
[2:26:22.400 --> 2:26:27.680]  National Guard has no leader as far as we know, which means, does this mean they're not going
[2:26:27.680 --> 2:26:32.640]  to be called out if they need to be? So we can kind of allow this type of activity to take place
[2:26:32.640 --> 2:26:38.000]  there on the streets of DC because there's no commander in chief there of the National Guard
[2:26:38.000 --> 2:26:42.160]  to call him in. Well, we got reports going back and forth as to whether it was let go by Obama
[2:26:42.160 --> 2:26:46.400]  or fired by Trump who did not want to have him continue because we know that the political
[2:26:46.400 --> 2:26:50.560]  appointees, the ambassadors had been shut down. But when you look at this, I mean, we've got a
[2:26:50.560 --> 2:26:56.000]  lot of different law enforcement groups here. This is not the National Guard. This is the DC
[2:26:56.000 --> 2:27:00.880]  city police. All of this is really under the control of the federal government because it's
[2:27:00.880 --> 2:27:05.040]  not a city really in that sense. It's not a state. It's a district of Columbia. They did that on
[2:27:05.040 --> 2:27:11.600]  purpose. But this is what is disturbing is to see that as we saw earlier, we talked about this,
[2:27:11.600 --> 2:27:17.600]  the idea that left is saying we've got five bills that have been introduced in Republican
[2:27:17.600 --> 2:27:24.800]  legislatures by Republicans to come after people who are blocking traffic, who are obstructing the
[2:27:24.800 --> 2:27:29.440]  roads, saying we're not going to come after you for criminal charges. Even if you kill somebody,
[2:27:29.440 --> 2:27:35.920]  if it's done accidentally, we're going to put in some other states that we're going to have a large
[2:27:36.720 --> 2:27:40.480]  fine or we're going to put people in jail for an extended amount of time because this
[2:27:40.480 --> 2:27:44.720]  is not speech. This is not speech. They don't want to talk. When you give them a microphone,
[2:27:44.720 --> 2:27:48.560]  we did this. We gave them a microphone. Tell us what your grievances are. But I'm not talking to
[2:27:48.560 --> 2:27:52.320]  you. Or if you would start to talk and then his leader would shut him down. Yeah.
[2:27:52.320 --> 2:27:56.240]  Yeah. Well, and then also too, a lot of people need to understand because when we were seeing this,
[2:27:56.240 --> 2:28:00.800]  these first reports coming out, oh, they're going to allow people to, if they accidentally run over
[2:28:00.800 --> 2:28:06.080]  a protest or they can get away with it. Well, no, the issue is, is one, we saw in Ferguson
[2:28:06.080 --> 2:28:10.080]  that they were out in the middle of the street at night. It was completely dark and there was
[2:28:10.080 --> 2:28:15.680]  no indication to oncoming traffic that these people were going to be just standing in the street.
[2:28:15.680 --> 2:28:20.240]  And so they got, some got hit. But then you also have the protesters that were surrounding
[2:28:20.240 --> 2:28:24.480]  people's vehicles, beating on their cars, beating, smashing their windows. And I'm sorry,
[2:28:24.480 --> 2:28:29.200]  but if you were, you're in there with your family, your first instinct is to get the hell out of
[2:28:29.200 --> 2:28:33.680]  there. So yes, if you're endangering someone else's life, you know, if it's in one of these
[2:28:33.680 --> 2:28:38.720]  kind of violent protests like this, we're talking about here, where they say, you know, you cannot
[2:28:38.720 --> 2:28:43.360]  shout, fire in a crowded theater to panic people. And yet that's precisely what these people in
[2:28:43.360 --> 2:28:48.160]  the undercover investigation by James O'Keefe and Project Veritas, they said, we've got people here
[2:28:48.160 --> 2:28:52.800]  who are trying to panic the crowd. They want to stampede people out of the deplorable. That's
[2:28:52.800 --> 2:28:57.360]  what they're, and they say, oh, we're just joking. You can't do that. And you also are not allowed
[2:28:57.360 --> 2:29:01.120]  to actually set fire to the theater because you don't like what's being played there. Okay. And
[2:29:01.120 --> 2:29:05.680]  that's what they allowed in Germany and said, that's free speech. Your comments, Darren, Margaret.
[2:29:05.680 --> 2:29:09.840]  That was funny, Darren. You can't set fire. I was just thinking about the 11 year old kids
[2:29:09.840 --> 2:29:15.440]  setting a fire last night when on Tucker Carlson show. And just think of the parents. I just thought
[2:29:15.440 --> 2:29:19.840]  about that. That is parental abuse to teach your kid that that is okay. That is a form of neglect,
[2:29:19.840 --> 2:29:24.640]  as far as I'm concerned. These people are domestic terrorists. It's baffling that domestic terrorism
[2:29:24.640 --> 2:29:29.440]  laws don't apply to this kind of behavior. It's like you get a free pass. If you hate Trump,
[2:29:29.440 --> 2:29:33.920]  you want to commit acts of domestic terrorism, you know, okay, check. Well, remember, there was a
[2:29:33.920 --> 2:29:38.560]  video, I think it was in New York, there was a guy that was an anti Trump guy, and he had his
[2:29:38.560 --> 2:29:44.640]  two young children there. And he's pointing at it was veterans for Trump. And he says,
[2:29:44.640 --> 2:29:49.760]  look in their eyes, look in their eyes, that kids, those guys, those are the enemy, right? And these
[2:29:49.760 --> 2:29:55.200]  are kids that he's teaching this hate for the president. Those are your kids. It's a shame.
[2:29:55.200 --> 2:29:59.680]  Absolutely. All right, well, we're here in Austin, and we're going to be coming right back after
[2:29:59.680 --> 2:30:04.560]  the break. We've got a special little report that we tried to play in the last segment. We've got
[2:30:04.560 --> 2:30:11.040]  that queued up. We're going to see one of these snowflakes up close and personal with his own
[2:30:11.040 --> 2:30:22.720]  personal accounts. Stay with us. We'll be right back. We're on the March. The empire's on the run.

[2:30:48.080 --> 2:30:54.000]  as a drug when used to prevent disease because unlike the minerals we need humans have no known
[2:30:54.000 --> 2:31:00.400]  physiological requirement for fluoride sodium fluoride long known as an effective roach poison
[2:31:00.400 --> 2:31:06.720]  is added to tablets and drops for the purpose of preventing tooth decay. In short, sodium fluoride
[2:31:06.720 --> 2:31:13.280]  is not a nutritional supplement. It is a prescription drug and a dangerous one. FDA recently announced
[2:31:13.280 --> 2:31:20.240]  that marketing fluoride drops and tablets for cavity prevention violates federal law because FDA
[2:31:20.240 --> 2:31:26.480]  never approved these products as either safe or effective. Don't use fluoride use the Alexa pure

[2:34:14.320 --> 2:34:18.000]  it is live we've had some people pushing back and saying this this happened earlier well i'm sure it
[2:34:18.000 --> 2:34:23.360]  did happen earlier it is also still happening now we've got live feed from time magazine from the
[2:34:23.360 --> 2:34:29.040]  canadian broadcasting corporation as well as video that we're seeing from fox news i'm not sure if the
[2:34:29.040 --> 2:34:34.160]  fox news was earlier but i think that is also live that is going on right now but we do know
[2:34:34.160 --> 2:34:39.440]  we have live feed from time magazine from cbc that's happening as well so there you go take your
[2:34:39.440 --> 2:34:43.520]  pic do you want the feed from earlier today or do you want what's going on now but that's the
[2:34:43.520 --> 2:34:50.080]  bottom line that's what they're doing now i want to go back to darin Mcbrane and margaret howell
[2:34:50.080 --> 2:34:58.000]  you had actually one of these precious snowflakes was telling us a very personal clip about how he
[2:34:58.000 --> 2:35:02.480]  felt about this and what he was going to do let's go back to darin that's right and margaret this
[2:35:02.480 --> 2:35:10.640]  is an urgent message from a liberal in distress okay so we take you now to an underground bunker
[2:35:10.640 --> 2:35:19.280]  deep in the heart of the land of idiocracy well here we are folks at the end of everything
[2:35:19.280 --> 2:35:26.160]  and human civilization as we know it is coming crashing down the world is over donald trump
[2:35:26.160 --> 2:35:33.920]  will be sworn in this week and then it's all over it's all over guys i'm so scared i'm so
[2:35:33.920 --> 2:35:40.720]  alone it's so scared it's scary real we elect him for the first time someone who is selfish
[2:35:40.720 --> 2:35:44.800]  dishonest egotistical for the first time when we could have had healer clinton instead
[2:35:44.800 --> 2:35:52.080]  and now we're going to pay the price we can survive this okay we can survive it but you
[2:35:52.080 --> 2:35:58.080]  have to get underground and i am at my mom's house where i've been temporarily rooming for the last
[2:35:58.880 --> 2:36:05.360]  31 years and i'm down in the basement as you can see i've made kind of a bunker for myself
[2:36:05.360 --> 2:36:10.720]  here in the basement you've got to get underground now because we don't have a lot of time it's
[2:36:10.720 --> 2:36:15.680]  installable food look based on everything that i've read on facebook right after the inauguration
[2:36:16.400 --> 2:36:24.880]  donald trump is going to drop a nuclear bomb on mexico and then after that the full-scale genocide
[2:36:24.880 --> 2:36:31.600]  of women and transgender people and gender non-conforming people will begin gender non-conforming
[2:36:31.600 --> 2:36:37.920]  after that according to my sources donald trump at the behest of putin will deliberately dump
[2:36:37.920 --> 2:36:45.680]  100 billion gallons of oil into the ocean in order to kill all of the dolphins and then
[2:36:46.560 --> 2:36:53.280]  based on what i've heard from people like teeth alderman he is going to blow up jupiter with a
[2:36:53.280 --> 2:37:01.200]  death ray and finally this will be on cnn tonight cruelty and sadism the last straw for all mankind
[2:37:01.200 --> 2:37:09.120]  will be when he blocks cnn reporters on twitter this is all going on already locked at the ymca so
[2:37:09.120 --> 2:37:13.600]  you need to prepare yourself now and if you have not been stocking supplies and foods you got to do
[2:37:13.600 --> 2:37:19.040]  that i have all of the supplies i'm going to need to survive the apocalypse right here and i wanted
[2:37:19.040 --> 2:37:24.480]  to show you a few things i have just to give you um just just to give you some ideas of what you
[2:37:24.480 --> 2:37:29.040]  need to have to be prepared on sale right now you're obviously going to need a lot of non-perishable
[2:37:29.040 --> 2:37:38.400]  food items vegan plant-based of course other survival foods uh pita chips gluten free obviously
[2:37:38.400 --> 2:37:42.560]  if you ever want to show you some stuff that are really working like a starbucks car down this way
[2:37:42.560 --> 2:37:46.720]  you know after the election we had a lot of liberals starbucks card yeah we had a lot of liberals
[2:37:46.720 --> 2:37:51.920]  going down and stocking up on guns for a change and you know it's uh they were very afraid of this i
[2:37:51.920 --> 2:37:56.720]  mean he's that's a great parody piece but let's talk about what you really do i don't think that's
[2:37:56.720 --> 2:38:02.720]  going to stop you from that death ray okay we do have in case all of you liberals now who realize
[2:38:02.720 --> 2:38:07.680]  that you need to prepare for uh situations like this as well as for conservatives are going to
[2:38:07.680 --> 2:38:13.680]  drop out we have info wars select storeable food 30 to 40 off that's part of our inauguration special
[2:38:13.680 --> 2:38:17.440]  and that's for people not just because you're afraid of donald trump but because you realize
[2:38:17.440 --> 2:38:21.680]  that you live in a real world we have a very fragile complicated infrastructure as we see
[2:38:21.680 --> 2:38:26.960]  every time there's a snowstorm all the snowflakes you need to understand this as well that you may
[2:38:26.960 --> 2:38:33.600]  also find empty shelves just like the countries that you admire like venezuela if you go down
[2:38:33.600 --> 2:38:39.360]  this path you follow uh sandernista economics you're going to have empty shelves like venezuela but
[2:38:39.360 --> 2:38:43.360]  even if that doesn't happen the next time a snowstorm comes through you could wind up not
[2:38:43.360 --> 2:38:50.000]  having any food 30 to 40 off that's all made in the us it's storable it's not going to uh spoil
[2:38:50.000 --> 2:38:54.560]  like the yogurt that he was holding up there uh you want something that is going to be packed to
[2:38:54.560 --> 2:39:00.880]  last for a while that doesn't have any gmo and that is resealable as well we also have continued

[2:39:36.080 --> 2:39:43.280]  know that poor baby my little boy i mean he really you could feel his uh he really believes it
[2:39:43.280 --> 2:39:48.640]  i mean that poor little boy you know i wish we should get that guy on on the show he's pretty
[2:39:48.640 --> 2:39:52.560]  good i mean you don't think he was made he really actually felt that way i mean i can't tell if he
[2:39:52.560 --> 2:39:58.320]  was joking or not he was of course he was just joking no that was a joke but it was it i mean
[2:39:58.320 --> 2:40:03.760]  we do know people out there like that we've seen them we haven't made a video he's making fun of
[2:40:03.760 --> 2:40:08.560]  what a lot of them act just right it's true we've seen so many that it's hard to tell if he was
[2:40:08.560 --> 2:40:14.960]  women serious or or joking hey you know we were talking about how the the behavior of the leftists
[2:40:14.960 --> 2:40:18.560]  when they when they do these protests and everything and we're just getting more and more
[2:40:18.560 --> 2:40:24.560]  new recruits the more they behave this way uh bikers for trump who are at the inauguration
[2:40:24.560 --> 2:40:31.520]  today you know they are 250 000 strong right now and they are getting 25 000 new recruits every
[2:40:31.520 --> 2:40:36.960]  single week you know we that is amazing leann and i met some bikers uh at the urn c and they were
[2:40:36.960 --> 2:40:42.400]  the most gracious gentle the bikers for trump they were awesome awesome people they should have
[2:40:42.400 --> 2:40:47.760]  like an adoption program where they adopt an fgw and sort of undeprogrammed model that's a good
[2:40:47.760 --> 2:40:52.240]  idea you know maybe that might help spend the day with a biker spend the day with a biker for trump
[2:40:52.240 --> 2:40:57.520]  might toughen him up a little bit maybe i thought it well yeah they said they were gonna have a
[2:40:57.520 --> 2:41:03.200]  wall of meat so um i guess uh we haven't seen them yet uh we've we've seen these uh live broadcast
[2:41:03.200 --> 2:41:08.480]  and i need to get over there where the uh they're clashing with police we know i think it's
[2:41:08.480 --> 2:41:12.640]  interesting as we look at this and of course we know what would have happened if hillary clinton
[2:41:13.200 --> 2:41:17.760]  had won don't we we know what that speech would have been like it would have been about me me me
[2:41:17.760 --> 2:41:23.760]  me me women women women women okay and donald trump really shut that down he said this isn't about
[2:41:23.760 --> 2:41:28.720]  transfer of power from a party to another party it isn't about transfer from one individual to
[2:41:28.720 --> 2:41:34.560]  another and we can say it's not about transfer for power from one sex to another or transfer power
[2:41:34.560 --> 2:41:40.960]  from one race to another it's about we the people and that's what donald trump talked about 45 times
[2:41:40.960 --> 2:41:45.360]  he talked about we the people only mentioned himself three times in that speech and yet we
[2:41:45.360 --> 2:41:50.000]  see exactly the opposite of that with brock obama and hillary clinton their glass ceiling
[2:41:50.000 --> 2:41:54.880]  they talk about and yet what they're shattering are the windows and businesses there and that
[2:41:54.880 --> 2:42:00.000]  is not free speech right sorry that's not free speech that is nothing but vandalism
[2:42:00.000 --> 2:42:04.800]  terrorism violence committed against people that is not free speech and i also really
[2:42:04.800 --> 2:42:10.480]  appreciated how he pointed out to other nations you know it's it's every nation sovereign right
[2:42:10.480 --> 2:42:14.720]  out there to put the interests of their country first and america hasn't been doing that for
[2:42:14.720 --> 2:42:19.920]  such a long time we're weakening ourselves and that we it is our sovereign right to be able to
[2:42:19.920 --> 2:42:26.320]  do that which of course we know with the the united nations their agenda is to totally take the sovereignty
[2:42:26.320 --> 2:42:31.600]  away from nations and give it to the one world power the one world government so i mean you could
[2:42:31.600 --> 2:42:37.360]  just see him giving that message specifically to all those people sitting behind him who are
[2:42:37.360 --> 2:42:43.360]  responsible for that who are witnessing that power being siphoned right from their fingertips how
[2:42:43.360 --> 2:42:50.320]  incredible guys he's putting america first and you know this is not just about donald trump
[2:42:50.320 --> 2:42:56.080]  becoming president this is about the american people invading washington dc and taking our
[2:42:56.080 --> 2:43:01.680]  country back back it's really inspiring i mean for us to have reclaimed our birthright other
[2:43:01.680 --> 2:43:05.280]  nations will follow suit and they will do the same i'm sorry to not tube i don't know if you've
[2:43:05.280 --> 2:43:10.160]  noticed this online we get so many comments love from ireland love from france we love you guys
[2:43:10.160 --> 2:43:14.720]  we're watching you here in morocco you know i i can't put seventeen seventy six worldwide it's
[2:43:14.720 --> 2:43:20.000]  literally going global it's global during the inauguration speech he said we are transferring
[2:43:20.000 --> 2:43:27.120]  power from washington dc to the american people january 20th 2017 will be known as the day when
[2:43:27.120 --> 2:43:33.440]  the people took control uh of the nation once again i mean there you go and he also talked a lot
[2:43:33.440 --> 2:43:37.440]  about god we were talking about that and you know obama would never do that and i mentioned this
[2:43:37.440 --> 2:43:42.000]  off camera he sounds so much like jfk in parts of these speeches in the speech that he gave you
[2:43:42.000 --> 2:43:46.640]  know he was reminiscent of jfk you know it was just amazing like little snippets of that you could
[2:43:46.640 --> 2:43:51.920]  really see that will live on forever absolutely live on forever yep well you know as we saw joe
[2:43:51.920 --> 2:43:59.200]  biden gave his farewell address to his um sponsors and producers there at dobos right i'd like to
[2:43:59.200 --> 2:44:03.760]  thank my producers he could have held up a golden globe a golden globalist award right that's what
[2:44:03.760 --> 2:44:08.400]  he got and i'd like to thank all of those who made this possible all you eight billionaires who
[2:44:09.040 --> 2:44:15.120]  own as much as the bottom half of the world so you know and that went down from 62 to only
[2:44:15.120 --> 2:44:20.160]  eight people having the same amount of wealth as the bottom half of the world that's why donald
[2:44:20.160 --> 2:44:25.440]  trump said their victories have not been your victories their triumphs have not been your
[2:44:25.440 --> 2:44:30.720]  triumphs we're going to change that you want jobs you want safe places to live that's a reasonable
[2:44:30.720 --> 2:44:36.960]  thing to request that is not unreasonable it is not racist it's not xenophobic to want that that's
[2:44:36.960 --> 2:44:40.480]  what everybody wants and so we're going to make that happen we're going to bring back the american
[2:44:40.480 --> 2:44:44.480]  dream and we're going to do it for americans right i'm actually i was looking at a story on drudge
[2:44:44.480 --> 2:44:49.600]  earlier how one of the worries they have at dobos is with this automation and how it's going to kill
[2:44:49.600 --> 2:44:54.880]  even more jobs they're not worried about that no they want i spoke when i spoke with uh the the man
[2:44:54.880 --> 2:45:00.800]  who wrote ai he had just left dobos last year and he said i said wouldn't it be great though if
[2:45:00.800 --> 2:45:05.520]  automated then everyone will just be free to to self actualize they'd have the freedom they wouldn't
[2:45:05.520 --> 2:45:11.360]  have to slave away and he said that would be terrible yeah millions of people free to do whatever
[2:45:11.360 --> 2:45:16.080]  they want that's what they want with universal basic income they want to pacify you and understand
[2:45:16.080 --> 2:45:20.400]  that when they give you universal basic income they're also going to take away your right to work
[2:45:20.400 --> 2:45:25.040]  and i i'm going to say this back when i had a business right we kept hearing that you know
[2:45:25.040 --> 2:45:28.800]  welfare is a right but if i wanted to open up a business i had to get a privilege license i said
[2:45:28.800 --> 2:45:32.960]  think about this you know if i want to work if i want to start a business that's a privilege
[2:45:32.960 --> 2:45:37.680]  if i want to go on welfare that's a right they will give you universal basic income but they will
[2:45:37.680 --> 2:45:41.680]  treat you the way our government has treated indians on a reservation they will contain you
[2:45:41.680 --> 2:45:46.240]  in an area they will tell you what you can and cannot do they will take your kids away remove
[2:45:46.240 --> 2:45:50.720]  them from you and educate them to their values that's what they have been doing to the american
[2:45:50.720 --> 2:45:56.560]  indians that's what the un agenda 21 the agenda for 2030 sustainability that's what that's about
[2:45:56.560 --> 2:46:02.560]  universal basic income is to pacify us it's a soft kill method it is to make us dependent on them
[2:46:02.560 --> 2:46:07.600]  and to take away our ability to work to think to be productive human beings to essentially have a
[2:46:07.600 --> 2:46:13.120]  fulfilled life they want to take that away and make us passive prisoners in their system right
[2:46:13.120 --> 2:46:18.880]  and these protesters out here who are clashing against you know capitalism and what they see
[2:46:18.880 --> 2:46:24.880]  is the enemy they're wanting that universal basic income they the system they say hasn't worked for
[2:46:24.880 --> 2:46:28.000]  them it's failed for them and they don't want to have to work they don't want to have to pay
[2:46:28.000 --> 2:46:34.320]  back those student loans nobody told them to get a degree in social justice warrior you know business
[2:46:34.320 --> 2:46:40.800]  but i mean i can understand people have some issues of course but a lot of people are saying
[2:46:40.800 --> 2:46:46.320]  let's give this man a chance let's see what he can do you know he's totally opposite of the
[2:46:46.320 --> 2:46:51.200]  establishment they're trying to tear down like darren you remember uh john lennon all we're
[2:46:51.200 --> 2:46:56.000]  saying is get piece of chance right give piece of give trump a chance give trump a chance all these
[2:46:56.000 --> 2:47:01.360]  guys don't want that they don't want to be live off the uh democratic plantation that's right they're
[2:47:01.360 --> 2:47:06.880]  comfortable there they want to stay there they don't want to you know work hard and if you manage to
[2:47:06.880 --> 2:47:11.520]  get a small business in this country though and employ people your tax to death you you know you
[2:47:11.520 --> 2:47:16.000]  have to provide help these new health care mandates you have to cut your employee workforce i mean
[2:47:16.000 --> 2:47:21.360]  just a lot so many regulations bogging down small business owners in this country you know it's
[2:47:21.360 --> 2:47:26.560]  almost they all you there is that push just to say i quit i quit just just i'll take my little part
[2:47:26.560 --> 2:47:30.800]  just give it to me i quit well and we're taking a look at all these protests that are going on
[2:47:30.800 --> 2:47:34.960]  right now wait until this evening you know and that's why we're going to stay live until late
[2:47:34.960 --> 2:47:40.480]  tonight or you know maybe 10 11 12 o'clock because once once it gets dark that's when all the freaks
[2:47:40.480 --> 2:47:46.160]  come out and i promise you it's going to get ugly this evening in certain portions of dc and we'll
[2:47:46.160 --> 2:47:50.640]  be there to cover it i was waiting for the fire extinguisher we're watching the somebody was setting
[2:47:50.640 --> 2:47:55.120]  fire to some garbage in the street just a moment ago i'm like where are the police with a fire
[2:47:55.120 --> 2:48:00.000]  extinguisher it looks like they have finally stepped up somebody had one in hand so well they
[2:48:00.000 --> 2:48:05.440]  have doesn't get too crazy yeah and they're and we see now there's sort of a wall of riot cops
[2:48:05.440 --> 2:48:09.840]  and then the wall of protesters where is the parade going to begin where are going to be the
[2:48:09.840 --> 2:48:13.920]  you know the eight eight thousand people who are going to be participating in the parade itself that
[2:48:13.920 --> 2:48:18.720]  doesn't that doesn't even include the spectators we're seeing underdog balloons i don't know the
[2:48:18.720 --> 2:48:23.760]  mummers you know we can let the right parade i don't know i'm not sure what feed we have behind us
[2:48:23.760 --> 2:48:29.440]  but it just had a kind of an image of them setting up for the parade and you can see the streets
[2:48:29.440 --> 2:48:35.600]  are set aside so are these riders going to come in from the from the sides and kind of well they
[2:48:35.600 --> 2:48:39.600]  bust them all in there's a lot of them out there and it's always very interesting to see how the
[2:48:39.600 --> 2:48:43.920]  mainstream media portrays this i always monitor the mainstream media at night and kind of see how
[2:48:43.920 --> 2:48:49.920]  they how they cover this and last night over and over it was just the scrolling ticker at the bottom
[2:48:49.920 --> 2:48:54.000]  whenever you would see donald trump and just repeatedly in your brain in your brain in your
[2:48:54.000 --> 2:48:59.760]  brain it was the most unpopular president in history coming president most least unpopular
[2:48:59.760 --> 2:49:04.960]  based on their phony polls the same polls that said 80 chance hillary clinton's gonna win the
[2:49:04.960 --> 2:49:09.680]  presidency the day of the election so i mean they're you know come on and no one's falling
[2:49:09.680 --> 2:49:14.480]  forward anymore but hey i guess some people are well and it's all about how we're losing the
[2:49:14.480 --> 2:49:21.040]  classiest greatest president ever and you know it's like yeah class and grace are great qualities
[2:49:21.040 --> 2:49:25.120]  of a leader but that does not mean he did a great job leading this country i think he was like the
[2:49:25.120 --> 2:49:29.920]  fourth worst in with economics and a misleader there's talk that they're gonna cancel the
[2:49:29.920 --> 2:49:34.160]  white house correspondence center you know the nerd prom where everybody who is anybody in
[2:49:34.160 --> 2:49:38.800]  washington shows up and they all sort of uh congratulate each other even if they do cancel
[2:49:38.800 --> 2:49:45.280]  that is does anybody care other than these you know other than them yeah i mean no not really
[2:49:45.280 --> 2:49:50.240]  good riddance good riddance okay well you know you had those pictures leanne of that that cnn
[2:49:50.240 --> 2:49:54.640]  was putting up and saying look you know here's uh here's the area of course uh it was a difference
[2:49:54.640 --> 2:49:58.960]  in time i believe but it was also a difference in weather there was also a difference in the fact
[2:49:58.960 --> 2:50:04.640]  that uh conservatives who didn't like barack obama didn't attack the left as they had their
[2:50:04.640 --> 2:50:08.480]  inaugural we let them celebrate their victory and i'm sure that they're going to show this
[2:50:08.480 --> 2:50:12.080]  picture this over here to the side of me and say look at this you know there's nobody at all at
[2:50:12.080 --> 2:50:16.560]  the end nobody even showed up completely empty out here and you got the place there where host
[2:50:16.560 --> 2:50:22.000]  in honoration there you know and so i'm sure that's that's the picture that they had push poles
[2:50:22.000 --> 2:50:25.440]  i guess they're gonna have push pictures you know they're gonna use to push the narrative
[2:50:25.440 --> 2:50:30.560]  i was covered at last night cnn was perched up on a roof now we know why they wanted an aerial shot
[2:50:30.560 --> 2:50:35.840]  of the ground before anybody got there exactly they were up so high really what they're doing up
[2:50:35.840 --> 2:50:40.320]  there hiding from everybody on a building turns out they wanted to get some fake pictures and push
[2:50:40.320 --> 2:50:45.680]  some fake news i mean that makes sense well cnn's a big trouble they are in their ratings are just
[2:50:45.680 --> 2:50:52.800]  you know meanwhile independent media skyrocketing so i think it's also kind of interesting that as
[2:50:52.800 --> 2:50:58.000]  hillary clinton was uh introduced and showed up and this is reported from philadelphia cbs local
[2:50:58.000 --> 2:51:03.200]  they say trump supporters chant lock her up when hillary clinton was announced at the inauguration
[2:51:03.200 --> 2:51:08.000]  and uh there's several people tweeted this out some of the crowd are chanting lock her up uh
[2:51:08.000 --> 2:51:12.720]  we can still hope that will happen hey no pardon she didn't get pardon that's right that's right it's
[2:51:12.720 --> 2:51:18.000]  too late now yeah too late now so he's he's gone no pardon for her all right we're gonna be right back

[2:54:46.960 --> 2:54:52.640]  here in austin and of course we'll be going back to our crew in washington bc the inaugural parade
[2:54:52.640 --> 2:54:58.320]  is going to be starting in about uh five ten minutes or so we'll be carrying that for you but
[2:54:58.320 --> 2:55:03.840]  also we'll have uh some more clips of donald trump's speech where he said this is not about
[2:55:03.840 --> 2:55:08.560]  transferring power to a person or a party but to the american people and we are going to
[2:55:09.120 --> 2:55:12.640]  take control of the government by the people rather than the people being controlled by
[2:55:12.640 --> 2:55:17.680]  the government it was a great speech and people that alex talked to and of course alex was
[2:55:18.480 --> 2:55:23.760]  very happy about what we all heard i think it was exactly the type of returned first
[2:55:23.760 --> 2:55:27.840]  principles american principles that we wanted to hear so we're all very optimistic at this
[2:55:27.840 --> 2:55:32.400]  point we want to give donald trump a chance but the people who are there don't and there
[2:55:32.400 --> 2:55:38.480]  uh we got a lot of protesters in the area uh reports from earlier about uh black lives
[2:55:38.480 --> 2:55:42.800]  matter attacking a woman and the police standing down that was uh someone that alex jones talked
[2:55:42.800 --> 2:55:47.440]  to a lady very small with a cane she was attacked knocked down kicked in the chest
[2:55:47.440 --> 2:55:51.760]  she said the police stood by but reporters helped her but i was talking before we went to break
[2:55:51.760 --> 2:55:57.520]  leon about uh hillary clinton and as she was introduced you can see this picture she doesn't
[2:55:57.520 --> 2:56:02.640]  look very happy neither does bill uh trump supporters are chanting lock her up when
[2:56:02.640 --> 2:56:08.800]  hillary clinton is announced uh you had some comments about her body language if you could
[2:56:08.800 --> 2:56:14.480]  see uh the right side broadcasting had a great angle on her um during their their coverage of
[2:56:14.480 --> 2:56:20.720]  the inauguration and so she was standing right behind michelle obama and to the to the back
[2:56:20.720 --> 2:56:26.320]  but all of these people who typically would come to kiss the ring uh with hillary clinton they were
[2:56:26.320 --> 2:56:31.120]  almost snubbing her or they'd just give her a little hey nice to see you or but they could
[2:56:31.120 --> 2:56:37.840]  she had no power first of all she hasn't been pardoned secondly so you could tell that everyone
[2:56:37.840 --> 2:56:42.800]  was being a little bit icy toward the clinton's and they were just sitting there with this sort of
[2:56:42.800 --> 2:56:47.840]  look of ooh we don't belong here anymore we don't fit in here we're getting snubbed left and right
[2:56:47.840 --> 2:56:53.600]  and she was trying to be gracious trying not to cry but it wasn't um you could also tell there was
[2:56:53.600 --> 2:56:59.440]  this real icy vibe in the air as well so we think uh darin and uh margaret do you think that the
[2:56:59.440 --> 2:57:03.120]  justice department or the fbi will continue their investigation and clinton foundation do you think
[2:57:03.120 --> 2:57:08.240]  they'll do something about it or is she too big to jail that's a good question you know one of the
[2:57:08.240 --> 2:57:13.840]  things trump has to do is drain the swamp in washington but he also has to drain the swamp in the fbi
[2:57:13.840 --> 2:57:19.280]  and the central intelligence agency deep in the sky all the intelligence communities that the swamp
[2:57:19.280 --> 2:57:25.280]  needs to be drained so remains to be seen i think that she is so delusional she is probably plotting
[2:57:25.280 --> 2:57:30.560]  another presidential run i mean it is just you know incessant with her we saw them shot down the
[2:57:30.560 --> 2:57:36.160]  clinton global foundation they know that there has been not only conflict of interest collusion
[2:57:36.160 --> 2:57:42.400]  but illegal activity in terms of taking money from foreign governments to try to influence policy
[2:57:42.400 --> 2:57:48.160]  it's a big no no and it's up to jeff sessions it's up to the doj it was a campaign promised by
[2:57:48.160 --> 2:57:53.920]  trump i think he will pursue it and if you know if justice is served she will be behind bars it was
[2:57:53.920 --> 2:57:58.160]  time for the country to heal you know he did come out with this message he was asked in that 60
[2:57:58.160 --> 2:58:03.440]  minutes interview i believe about this with leslie stahl and uh he did indicate that he was not going
[2:58:03.440 --> 2:58:07.280]  to do that doesn't mean that he doesn't have to have an injustice exactly he doesn't have to hey
[2:58:07.280 --> 2:58:12.320]  we're talking about body language at the inauguration you should have seen bill clinton's body language
[2:58:12.320 --> 2:58:18.320]  when he was looking at the first lady really oh i look like hillary looked at him like not oh my god
[2:58:18.320 --> 2:58:22.800]  you're not doing this right now are you she's got to get a leash from him i mean this is just he was
[2:58:23.760 --> 2:58:30.160]  i miss this we need to dig that up for you and replay this actually would be a good replay hey guys
[2:58:30.160 --> 2:58:34.560]  we just got word that at the university of texas right now there's hundreds of people doing a

[3:04:23.720 --> 3:04:31.720]  We will face challenges, we will confront hardships, but we will get the job done.
[3:04:31.720 --> 3:04:38.720]  Every four years we gather on these steps to carry out the orderly and peaceful transfer of power.
[3:04:38.720 --> 3:04:50.720]  And we are grateful to President Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama for their gracious aid throughout this transition.
[3:04:50.720 --> 3:05:00.720]  We have been magnificent. Thank you.
[3:05:00.720 --> 3:05:15.720]  Today's ceremony, however, has very special meaning because today we are not merely transferring power from one administration to another or from one party to another,
[3:05:15.720 --> 3:05:30.720]  we are transferring power from Washington D.C. and giving it back to you, the people.
[3:05:30.720 --> 3:05:36.720]  It was Thomas Jefferson who once said that our country is now taking so steady, of course, as to show by what road it will pass to destruction to wit,
[3:05:36.720 --> 3:05:40.720]  by consolidation of power first and then corruption its necessary consequence.
[3:05:40.720 --> 3:05:47.720]  Jefferson was warning us about the global elite, the 1% of the 1%, consolidating the world's wealth and subverting the people's voice in government.
[3:05:47.720 --> 3:05:49.720]  Unfortunately, we didn't heed his advice.
[3:05:49.720 --> 3:05:55.720]  We now live in a neo feudalistic society in which we're treated as indentured servants who only exist to serve the needs of the establishment.
[3:05:55.720 --> 3:06:03.720]  Political office no longer represents the voice of the people, but rather the initiation process politicians go through to gain acceptance into the aristocracy.
[3:06:03.720 --> 3:06:11.720]  Simply put, we the people are responsible for civilization and culture, yet we're suppressed by a tiny elite who have organized into criminal gangs that operate governments around the world.
[3:06:11.720 --> 3:06:19.720]  We falsely believe that everything is simply black and white, one extreme against the other, conservative versus liberal, but things will change once more of us realize this truth.
[3:06:19.720 --> 3:06:26.720]  As Thomas Jefferson also said, enlightened the people generally, and tyranny and oppressions of the body and mind will vanish like evil spirits at the dawn of day.
[3:06:26.720 --> 3:06:29.720]  This is Kit Daniels with Infowars.com

[3:08:58.720 --> 3:09:06.720]  We're going to be going to Owen Schroyer in Washington, D.C. in just a moment. Trump is my president. Deal with it, folks.
[3:09:06.720 --> 3:09:08.720]  That's the next shirt.
[3:09:08.720 --> 3:09:25.720]  That's right, and so we have a shirt that says that. Trump is my president, and we have that on sale. It's a limited edition collector's item, and it's something that, you know, just wear those and help all these snowflakes to kind of break into the notion that, yes, Trump is my president.
[3:09:25.720 --> 3:09:27.720]  He's your president now, too.
[3:09:27.720 --> 3:09:29.720]  I put that on the back. Yours, too.
[3:09:29.720 --> 3:09:38.720]  We didn't like having Obama as our president, but we dealt with it for eight years, and now they're going to have to deal with Trump as president, so you can get that for 995andinfowarsstore.com.
[3:09:38.720 --> 3:09:47.720]  Also, you know, he was talking about it's not which party controls the government, but whether or not government is controlled by the people. That was from Donald Trump's excellent speech.
[3:09:47.720 --> 3:09:49.720]  I thought he had made some great points there.
[3:09:49.720 --> 3:10:01.720]  If you believe that, and if you think that America is going to be free again, or you want America to be free again, make America free again. Our cap is also available at infowars.com, and also the President Trump lithograph.
[3:10:01.720 --> 3:10:07.720]  It's 16 by 20. It's a limited edition. It's done by the same artist that did the classic Ronald Reagan portrait.
[3:10:07.720 --> 3:10:11.720]  He's the RNC portrait artist, the official RNC portrait artist.
[3:10:11.720 --> 3:10:20.720]  If you've seen that picture of Ronald Reagan with the cowboy hat on, this is the same artist that did that. It's a very detailed, beautiful portrait.
[3:10:20.720 --> 3:10:25.720]  It's 16 by 20, and it's a limited edition available only at Infowarsstore.com.
[3:10:25.720 --> 3:10:29.720]  1995, the President Trump portrait.
[3:10:29.720 --> 3:10:39.720]  And also our sale that we have, that we began at the beginning of the year, 20 to 30% off Infowars live products, some of our best sellers on sale.
[3:10:39.720 --> 3:10:43.720]  That is going to be ending soon with this inauguration, but that is still available.
[3:10:43.720 --> 3:10:52.720]  So go to infowarslife.com. Take a look at some of the best sellers that we've now put on sale, anywhere from 20 to 30% off at infowarslife.com.
[3:10:52.720 --> 3:10:58.720]  Joining us now is Owen Schreuer, one of our reporters in Washington, D.C.
[3:10:58.720 --> 3:10:59.720]  Owen.
[3:10:59.720 --> 3:11:04.720]  What's going on, David? I just left one of the crew bases to head back out.
[3:11:04.720 --> 3:11:10.720]  And there's not too much action out here. I think most of it has moved towards the White House, towards the Washington Monument.
[3:11:10.720 --> 3:11:16.720]  So that's where I'm headed right now. It was all on Capitol Hill earlier and at Union Station earlier.
[3:11:16.720 --> 3:11:18.720]  Oh, we can't go through here?
[3:11:18.720 --> 3:11:23.720]  No, I've got to get to the Washington Monument. Is this the best way to go through here?
[3:11:23.720 --> 3:11:29.720]  And you know what? I'll just say this for a second. I don't want anything to happen to the President.
[3:11:29.720 --> 3:11:36.720]  Okay, of course, we don't want anything to happen to the President. We understand why they need the safety, but I mean, my God, can I use a road?
[3:11:36.720 --> 3:11:42.720]  It's like, I have to walk through a maze. It takes two hours to go two blocks.
[3:11:42.720 --> 3:11:43.720]  Oh, yeah.
[3:11:43.720 --> 3:11:44.720]  My God.
[3:11:44.720 --> 3:11:47.720]  And then you got protesters trying to make it even more inconvenient for you.
[3:11:47.720 --> 3:11:58.720]  I'm telling you, Owen, when we covered the Pope's visit and we went to Washington, New York and Philadelphia, Philadelphia was way worse than the other two cities who were used to dealing with this sort of thing all the time.
[3:11:58.720 --> 3:12:05.720]  But of course, one of the reasons that you're seeing so much security here is because of all the threats that we were told, hey, we're just joking.
[3:12:05.720 --> 3:12:08.720]  We're not really going to do that. And yet they are getting violent with people.
[3:12:08.720 --> 3:12:16.720]  Well, and one thing, one thing I think that they're trying to sell right now is that Donald Trump didn't have a big inauguration, that there weren't that many people there.
[3:12:16.720 --> 3:12:20.720]  Well, there were protesters blocking the gates. Okay.
[3:12:20.720 --> 3:12:21.720]  Yeah.
[3:12:21.720 --> 3:12:24.720]  They were intentionally blocking the gate. So they're going to run with this false narrative.
[3:12:24.720 --> 3:12:29.720]  They've got videos of the protesters blocking the gates. They claim, oh, I'm just in line. I'm just in line.
[3:12:29.720 --> 3:12:32.720]  But come on, we know what you're doing. We know what your plans were.
[3:12:32.720 --> 3:12:35.720]  And I guess they were effective. I don't know. It was tough.
[3:12:35.720 --> 3:12:40.720]  I mean, there were, I saw 20,000 people waiting to get in and that couldn't even get in.
[3:12:40.720 --> 3:12:42.720]  I could never even see what went on inside.
[3:12:42.720 --> 3:12:44.720]  I saw, hey, how are you doing, guys? Thanks for the support.
[3:12:44.720 --> 3:12:47.720]  Oh, by the way, we get so much love out here. It's ridiculous.
[3:12:47.720 --> 3:12:48.720]  Yeah.
[3:12:48.720 --> 3:12:51.720]  They say that they are occupying DC.
[3:12:51.720 --> 3:12:53.720]  No, we have occupied DC ladies and gentlemen.
[3:12:53.720 --> 3:12:58.720]  Right. Well, that's why you have DC establishment saying they felt like their town was being invaded.
[3:12:58.720 --> 3:13:01.720]  Yeah. Invaded with patriots.
[3:13:01.720 --> 3:13:03.720]  Yeah, they don't know what to do.
[3:13:03.720 --> 3:13:04.720]  Right.
[3:13:04.720 --> 3:13:06.720]  They don't know what to do. You should have seen them at the deplorable last night.
[3:13:06.720 --> 3:13:12.720]  They were out in the streets running around with their faces covered, throwing objects, trying to intimidate and bully people.
[3:13:12.720 --> 3:13:14.720]  It's ridiculous.
[3:13:14.720 --> 3:13:19.720]  But nobody got into the, into the deplorable and created anything on the inside. Is that correct?
[3:13:19.720 --> 3:13:23.720]  No, no, I did not see anything on the inside. There was some, it was a good time.
[3:13:23.720 --> 3:13:27.720]  Sheriff David Clark gave an absolutely rousing speech that got the house.
[3:13:27.720 --> 3:13:29.720]  I thought the place was going to come down.
[3:13:29.720 --> 3:13:30.720]  So that was cool.
[3:13:30.720 --> 3:13:32.720]  But no, everything inside was good.
[3:13:32.720 --> 3:13:38.720]  And actually there was a line of police in front of the entrance to the press square and I'm out front.
[3:13:38.720 --> 3:13:43.720]  I think the video may be on the Alex June channel on YouTube, but I'm out front and I'm talking to some of the protesters.
[3:13:43.720 --> 3:13:45.720]  They keep saying my name. They're trying to intimidate me.
[3:13:45.720 --> 3:13:49.720]  So I'm like, Oh, you know who I am? Like, why don't we talk to keep hiding their faces?
[3:13:49.720 --> 3:13:54.720]  And then the police basically grabbed me and pulling said, stop it and go inside.
[3:13:54.720 --> 3:13:58.720]  So they, they were trying to, uh, they were trying to quell some of that from our side too.
[3:13:58.720 --> 3:14:01.720]  But inside the event, there was no issues.
[3:14:01.720 --> 3:14:03.720]  Yeah, that's interesting. Very interesting.
[3:14:03.720 --> 3:14:07.720]  Of course, um, uh, this is Owen Shroyer and that's video from last night.
[3:14:07.720 --> 3:14:09.720]  I guess that we've got up there. Is that correct guys?
[3:14:09.720 --> 3:14:12.720]  Yeah, that's a video.
[3:14:12.720 --> 3:14:15.720]  Yeah, that's a video that I believe I shot last night outside of the ball.
[3:14:15.720 --> 3:14:19.720]  Yeah, we saw someone bleeding from the back of their head after they got hit with the flagpole.
[3:14:19.720 --> 3:14:23.720]  There was one of them tried to hit me with a flagpole.
[3:14:23.720 --> 3:14:27.720]  There was a, there was a grandma who came running out with her little grandchild crying.
[3:14:27.720 --> 3:14:29.720]  It was one of the worst sites you could ever see.
[3:14:29.720 --> 3:14:32.720]  Those protesters.
[3:14:32.720 --> 3:14:35.720]  Yeah, when they go low, they really go low, don't they?
[3:14:35.720 --> 3:14:39.720]  Yeah, I think I think Madonna actually called out for that.
[3:14:39.720 --> 3:14:42.720]  She said, we need to go with low as we can go.
[3:14:42.720 --> 3:14:45.720]  Yeah, which is pretty darn low for her.
[3:14:45.720 --> 3:14:52.720]  I heard, uh, I actually heard that Bill Clinton was going to vote for Donald Trump until he heard that Madonna was offering fallatio.
[3:14:52.720 --> 3:14:54.720]  And then he switched his vote to Hillary.
[3:14:54.720 --> 3:14:57.720]  So I don't know, that's just a little intel that I got on the side out here.
[3:14:57.720 --> 3:15:01.720]  But, but no, I'm, I'm heading towards where I think more of the action is going to be.
[3:15:01.720 --> 3:15:06.720]  Uh, I don't know if you guys are in touch with the other crew, but apparently there were some explosions.
[3:15:06.720 --> 3:15:10.720]  Oh, I need to go off the show. There were some explosions up at K and 21st Street.
[3:15:10.720 --> 3:15:12.720]  Kit Daniels was on the scene.
[3:15:12.720 --> 3:15:20.720]  He said that there were protesters burning things, burning newsstands, basically rioting going on.
[3:15:20.720 --> 3:15:22.720]  So I know that he's going to have footage of that.
[3:15:22.720 --> 3:15:29.720]  I'm going to come up from the south and come up from the Washington monument because I've heard that there might be some action there as well.
[3:15:29.720 --> 3:15:30.720]  And then make my way up north.
[3:15:30.720 --> 3:15:31.720]  Are you guys like info wars?
[3:15:31.720 --> 3:15:32.720]  Yes.
[3:15:32.720 --> 3:15:34.720]  Awesome. We're live right now. Say hi to the audience.
[3:15:34.720 --> 3:15:44.720]  Of course. So when we were airing some of the live shots that I think time magazine had some live feed of some of that and fires that were being said.
[3:15:44.720 --> 3:15:47.720]  And as we're doing that, we've got people saying that was last night.
[3:15:47.720 --> 3:15:49.720]  That's not today or that was earlier this morning.
[3:15:49.720 --> 3:15:51.720]  There's a lot of stuff that's going on there.
[3:15:51.720 --> 3:15:58.720]  And I think it just underscores the fact that these people don't want to participate in the political process.
[3:15:58.720 --> 3:15:59.720]  They don't want to speak.
[3:15:59.720 --> 3:16:06.720]  We saw that with Rob do as he went out and he put a microphone in their case and their face and said, here, speak and tell us what your grievances are.
[3:16:06.720 --> 3:16:07.720]  They don't want to do that.
[3:16:07.720 --> 3:16:11.720]  They just want to shut down other people and they want to shut down everybody else's speech.
[3:16:11.720 --> 3:16:13.720]  They want to shut down the democratic process.
[3:16:13.720 --> 3:16:15.720]  Well, and we've absolutely proved that in space.
[3:16:15.720 --> 3:16:21.720]  And they not like you said, they don't want to, they don't want to take place with the democracy that we're running the political process.
[3:16:21.720 --> 3:16:23.720]  And they don't want to engage in conversation.
[3:16:23.720 --> 3:16:25.720]  They just want to come out here and whine and cry.
[3:16:25.720 --> 3:16:26.720]  That's it.
[3:16:26.720 --> 3:16:27.720]  That's it.
[3:16:27.720 --> 3:16:31.720]  And I've got about five more videos that I'm going to upload later that are going to prove the same thing.
[3:16:31.720 --> 3:16:33.720]  I got called a white male again five times.
[3:16:33.720 --> 3:16:35.720]  I know I'm a white male.
[3:16:35.720 --> 3:16:37.720]  Like I have a mirror.
[3:16:37.720 --> 3:16:39.720]  I have a mirror.
[3:16:39.720 --> 3:16:40.720]  I don't know.
[3:16:40.720 --> 3:16:43.720]  Well, you know, some dysphoria.
[3:16:43.720 --> 3:16:50.720]  The chip on her shoulder, Megan Kelly, a reporter who moved to another network after they replaced her with a white male.
[3:16:50.720 --> 3:16:55.720]  We now have he is now killing the ratings in her time spot.
[3:16:55.720 --> 3:16:57.720]  Of course he is. Yeah. Yeah.
[3:16:57.720 --> 3:16:59.720]  Yeah. Here's the future of Fox News.
[3:16:59.720 --> 3:17:01.720]  Hannity Tucker Carlson.
[3:17:01.720 --> 3:17:05.720]  And if Bill O'Reilly comes around, he might, he might stick around and continue to be a big thing too.
[3:17:05.720 --> 3:17:09.720]  But yeah, the Megan Kelly's of the world, the shills of the world, they're done.
[3:17:09.720 --> 3:17:10.720]  CNN is done.
[3:17:10.720 --> 3:17:11.720]  CNN is fake news.
[3:17:11.720 --> 3:17:13.720]  They're hiding on top of a building.
[3:17:13.720 --> 3:17:18.720]  You know that, you know, they're on top of a building because they can't have people walking around behind them, calling them fake news,
[3:17:18.720 --> 3:17:22.720]  showing that Trump is really all the Trump supporters are out here, not the protesters.
[3:17:22.720 --> 3:17:26.720]  So hold on, guys, let me look into the clouds. Is CNN up there?
[3:17:26.720 --> 3:17:36.720]  Well, we have had reports that a YMCA in California said we're going to take off CNN off of our screens here in the gym because they are fake news.
[3:17:36.720 --> 3:17:38.720]  And then people started screaming censorship.
[3:17:38.720 --> 3:17:45.720]  Look, the people who want censorship are the people who are part, who are in Hollywood, who are essentially pushing their Neo McCarthyism,
[3:17:45.720 --> 3:17:50.720]  their Neo Cold War, their political correctness, which is nothing but censorship and black lists.
[3:17:50.720 --> 3:17:53.720]  And they ought to be ashamed of that. And we're going to call them out for that.
[3:17:53.720 --> 3:18:01.720]  And the thing about that is too, see, CNN knows that most people that watch CNN or whatever Fox News knows this to,
[3:18:01.720 --> 3:18:03.720]  that they're probably just reading the bottom line.
[3:18:03.720 --> 3:18:05.720]  They're probably just reading the headlines.
[3:18:05.720 --> 3:18:06.720]  They're not actually listening.
[3:18:06.720 --> 3:18:08.720]  They're probably seeing it at the gym.
[3:18:08.720 --> 3:18:13.720]  So that's why they push these bottom lines and these headlines that are so extreme.
[3:18:13.720 --> 3:18:17.720]  So that people see that and then they take that literally while they're on the elliptical with the gym.
[3:18:17.720 --> 3:18:23.720]  Well, look what they did with the bottom line on Alex Jones when they put their Alex Jones and put KKK leader or whatever.
[3:18:23.720 --> 3:18:24.720]  Remember that lower third?
[3:18:24.720 --> 3:18:25.720]  So they put that.
[3:18:25.720 --> 3:18:28.720]  So if you're in the gym and you see that and you don't have any sound, that's what you see there.
[3:18:28.720 --> 3:18:30.720]  Alex Jones is now a KKK leader.
[3:18:30.720 --> 3:18:32.720]  That's the way they deceive people.
[3:18:32.720 --> 3:18:40.720]  And that's probably one of the reasons that that type of reporting is probably why the YMCA wisely chose to delete them off the screen.
[3:18:40.720 --> 3:18:46.720]  The next thing the YMCA needs to do, and I've told them this before, I've been a YMCA member for a long time.
[3:18:46.720 --> 3:18:47.720]  I'm proud of that.
[3:18:47.720 --> 3:18:50.720]  But they need to get fluoride out of their drinking fountains.
[3:18:50.720 --> 3:18:52.720]  That's the next big revolution the Y can start.
[3:18:52.720 --> 3:18:57.720]  So you start something here, you take CNN off the TV, and then you take the fluoride out of the water.
[3:18:57.720 --> 3:18:59.720]  What do you know? You're the biggest Patriots in the gym industry.
[3:18:59.720 --> 3:19:01.720]  All right. Well, thank you, Owen.
[3:19:01.720 --> 3:19:03.720]  Keep going and let us know if you see anything there.
[3:19:03.720 --> 3:19:06.720]  As we know, there are events that are happening there.
[3:19:06.720 --> 3:19:08.720]  They're beginning the parade pretty soon.
[3:19:08.720 --> 3:19:09.720]  I want to go to...
[3:19:09.720 --> 3:19:10.720]  Yeah, we'll be live all night.
[3:19:10.720 --> 3:19:11.720]  So call in when you can.
[3:19:11.720 --> 3:19:12.720]  That's right.
[3:19:12.720 --> 3:19:13.720]  Thank you, Owen.
[3:19:13.720 --> 3:19:20.720]  This is Owen Shaw, our reporter in Washington, D.C. on the road walking everywhere.
[3:19:20.720 --> 3:19:26.720]  Because I tell you why, when you go these places, when we were in Philadelphia, as he pointed out, you just can't get anywhere.
[3:19:26.720 --> 3:19:30.720]  I mean, they block everything off, and we could only go a couple of feet, and then they blocked that off.
[3:19:30.720 --> 3:19:36.720]  We arrived on the train, and they had shut down any access to taxis or anything.
[3:19:36.720 --> 3:19:42.720]  And we walked, and I think it's about two hours with all of our luggage and equipment to walk to our hotel.
[3:19:42.720 --> 3:19:44.720]  It was absolutely crazy, and that was just for the Pope.
[3:19:44.720 --> 3:19:47.720]  I mean, it wasn't... Nobody was threatening the Pope.
[3:19:47.720 --> 3:19:52.720]  Nobody was saying they were going to throw excrement at the Pope or anything, and they did all of that in Philadelphia.
[3:19:52.720 --> 3:19:57.720]  Well, in D.C. isn't a very large city or state, I guess.
[3:19:57.720 --> 3:19:59.720]  Well, it's kind of both. It's a district.
[3:19:59.720 --> 3:20:00.720]  Yeah, it's a district.
[3:20:00.720 --> 3:20:03.720]  It isn't a state, but it is a whole separate thing.
[3:20:03.720 --> 3:20:10.720]  It's small, but that's why it was so effective for them to shut down with just blockading there.
[3:20:10.720 --> 3:20:15.720]  And the D.C. Metro and then these checkpoints, because it's so hard to get around.
[3:20:15.720 --> 3:20:17.720]  Everyone has to be funneled through these checkpoints.
[3:20:17.720 --> 3:20:20.720]  You've got a lot of people packed in one little small area there,
[3:20:20.720 --> 3:20:23.720]  and those people are very concerned that they're going to lose their special privilege.
[3:20:23.720 --> 3:20:26.720]  One of the wealthiest places on Earth, the District of Criminals.
[3:20:26.720 --> 3:20:51.720]  Stay with us, we'll be right back.

[3:24:14.720 --> 3:24:27.720]  born of sheds and tears over the red, white, and blue, Revelation the Movie.info. Americans need to see this film, Revelation the Movie.info. Let's fix it.
[3:24:53.720 --> 3:24:56.720]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show. I'm David Knight here in Austin.
[3:24:56.720 --> 3:25:00.720]  We're going to be joining some of our crew who are live in Washington, D.C.
[3:25:00.720 --> 3:25:02.720]  Of course, Donald Trump is now president.
[3:25:02.720 --> 3:25:07.720]  Donald Trump. That happened at noon Eastern and we've been playing you some of those clips.
[3:25:07.720 --> 3:25:12.720]  A great speech talking about how this is not the transfer of power from one person to another.
[3:25:12.720 --> 3:25:15.720]  It's not the transfer of power from one party to another.
[3:25:15.720 --> 3:25:18.720]  It is transferring power back to the people.
[3:25:18.720 --> 3:25:27.720]  And of course, he referenced the people 45 times about the same number of times that Barack Obama referenced himself in his farewell address to the press.
[3:25:27.720 --> 3:25:29.720]  45 times Barack Obama talks about himself.
[3:25:29.720 --> 3:25:32.720]  Donald Trump on becoming president only talked about himself three times.
[3:25:32.720 --> 3:25:36.720]  But here's an interesting thing that just went up on the Drudge Report from Mark Moreno.
[3:25:36.720 --> 3:25:44.720]  We talked to him earlier this week, Climate Depot. All references to climate change have now been deleted from the White House website.
[3:25:44.720 --> 3:25:46.720]  That happened at noon today and he points it out.
[3:25:46.720 --> 3:25:56.720]  It said at 11.59 a.m. Eastern, the official White House website had a lengthy information page about the threat of climate change and the steps the federal government had taken to fight it.
[3:25:56.720 --> 3:26:01.720]  At noon, one minute later, at the instant Donald Trump took office, the page was gone.
[3:26:01.720 --> 3:26:05.720]  As well as any mention of climate change or global warming.
[3:26:05.720 --> 3:26:11.720]  Who will protect us from unicorn farts now that Barack Obama is gone.
[3:26:11.720 --> 3:26:21.720]  I mean, the UN has told us it's true. Remember, the UN IPCC, the people who were at the center of Climate Gate, all of those rigged reports.
[3:26:21.720 --> 3:26:25.720]  They're passing notes back and forth. How are we going to hide the decline in temperatures?
[3:26:25.720 --> 3:26:27.720]  That's why they're talking about climate change.
[3:26:27.720 --> 3:26:32.720]  That's why they're talking about it instead of global warming, instead of manmade global warming.
[3:26:32.720 --> 3:26:40.720]  Folks, this fiction is created as a massive power grab by the globalist government.
[3:26:40.720 --> 3:26:44.720]  They need a global crisis in order to seize power.
[3:26:44.720 --> 3:26:49.720]  In order to fund a global government, they need a global tax.
[3:26:49.720 --> 3:26:58.720]  And if you haven't figured it out yet, this is a massive crony capitalism, a massive transfer of wealth from one group of people to the other.
[3:26:58.720 --> 3:27:02.720]  That would be from you to the few billionaires who run the world.
[3:27:02.720 --> 3:27:05.720]  And we just saw how that worked out in Davos.
[3:27:05.720 --> 3:27:11.720]  The eight at the top that have as much money as half of the world's population at the bottom.
[3:27:11.720 --> 3:27:15.720]  And that's concentrated down from just 62 last year.
[3:27:15.720 --> 3:27:19.720]  That was bad enough, but now it's down to eight.
[3:27:19.720 --> 3:27:24.720]  And as Donald Trump pointed out in his acceptance speech, he said, their victories have not been your victories.
[3:27:24.720 --> 3:27:27.720]  Their triumphs had not been your triumphs.
[3:27:27.720 --> 3:27:30.720]  That changes right here, right now.
[3:27:30.720 --> 3:27:35.720]  That's why the establishment and both parties have tried to stop this.
[3:27:35.720 --> 3:27:44.720]  And I have to say to people, even though Donald Trump has not focused on civil liberties, like you would see from a president, Rand Paul, or whatever candidate, Rand Paul,
[3:27:44.720 --> 3:27:51.720]  he's not focused on that, but you have to understand if you're for individual liberty, you have got to reverse this trend of consolidation
[3:27:51.720 --> 3:27:58.720]  from the individual to the government, to the state, to the federal government, to the global government.
[3:27:58.720 --> 3:28:01.720]  You have to reverse this concentration of power.
[3:28:01.720 --> 3:28:03.720]  You have to stand there and say, that's enough.
[3:28:03.720 --> 3:28:04.720]  And that's what he's done.
[3:28:04.720 --> 3:28:07.720]  That's what the speech today was about.
[3:28:07.720 --> 3:28:12.720]  Very, very important to see this reversal as we're looking at this.
[3:28:12.720 --> 3:28:19.720]  And when I look at the protesters, and we're going to go back and talk to our reporters in Washington about this.
[3:28:19.720 --> 3:28:23.720]  Again, over and over again, we see that the left does not want to debate.
[3:28:23.720 --> 3:28:25.720]  They want to censor.
[3:28:25.720 --> 3:28:26.720]  They want to shut down.
[3:28:26.720 --> 3:28:29.720]  They want to black out what people are saying.
[3:28:29.720 --> 3:28:37.720]  If they wanted to participate in the voting process, these violent protesters right after the election of Donald Trump, they would have registered to vote.
[3:28:37.720 --> 3:28:39.720]  They didn't even bother to register to vote.
[3:28:39.720 --> 3:28:42.720]  But they want to shut down your celebration.
[3:28:42.720 --> 3:28:44.720]  They want to shut down your victory.
[3:28:44.720 --> 3:28:47.720]  They want to shut down the movement of power back to the people.
[3:28:47.720 --> 3:28:51.720]  And it's quite obvious why they do not want to speak on camera.
[3:28:51.720 --> 3:28:57.720]  As we started out the broadcast this morning, we had Rob do offer one of them to talk.
[3:28:57.720 --> 3:29:03.720]  And the first guy that he handed the microphone to just came back with the racist, sexist, homophobic nonsense that we see.
[3:29:03.720 --> 3:29:10.720]  Just like we see Barbara Streisand coming out and saying, Trump is clueless, reckless, graceless, mindless, heartless.
[3:29:10.720 --> 3:29:14.720]  Barbara, you should talk less because this is the Streisand effect.
[3:29:14.720 --> 3:29:21.720]  You are just making the case that you people don't want to have a dialogue.
[3:29:21.720 --> 3:29:23.720]  You don't have anything to offer us.
[3:29:23.720 --> 3:29:27.720]  And of course, Nancy Pelosi is going to continue down that same road.
[3:29:27.720 --> 3:29:32.720]  We got Chuck Schumer saying, I'm going to block any Supreme Court justices that come out from Donald Trump.
[3:29:32.720 --> 3:29:33.720]  Just because.
[3:29:33.720 --> 3:29:34.720]  Just because.
[3:29:34.720 --> 3:29:35.720]  We're going to obstruct this.
[3:29:35.720 --> 3:29:38.720]  These people want a cold war.
[3:29:38.720 --> 3:29:44.720]  These Hollywood people who all this time have been talking about they want peace and so forth.
[3:29:44.720 --> 3:29:45.720]  They want a cold war.
[3:29:45.720 --> 3:29:46.720]  They want us to go to war with Russia.
[3:29:46.720 --> 3:29:53.720]  They want to get in now on the side of the military industrial complex while they call everybody else fascists.
[3:29:53.720 --> 3:29:57.720]  They want to expand the number of wars from four to seven.
[3:29:57.720 --> 3:30:04.720]  The guy that they love so much was the first president we had that was at war for his entire eight years, Barack Obama.
[3:30:04.720 --> 3:30:10.720]  And so you got the Hollywood piece, Nick's that are out there always talking about peace and yet they're the ones pushing for war.
[3:30:10.720 --> 3:30:11.720]  Stay with us.
[3:30:11.720 --> 3:30:37.720]  We're on the march. The empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[3:30:37.720 --> 3:30:41.720]  He had created it, but that it would become a tool to destroy individual liberty.
[3:30:41.720 --> 3:30:44.720]  His warnings ignored have now come to pass.
[3:30:44.720 --> 3:30:50.720]  He said, you're not to inquire how your trade may be increased nor how you were to become a great and powerful people,
[3:30:50.720 --> 3:30:55.720]  but how your liberties can be secured for liberty ought to be the direct end of your government.
[3:30:55.720 --> 3:31:03.720]  Patrick Henry warned us the liberties of a people never were nor ever will be secure when the transactions of their rulers may be concealed from them.
[3:31:03.720 --> 3:31:07.720]  Today, everything the government does at every level is concealed from us.
[3:31:07.720 --> 3:31:12.720]  We have trade deals to manage our economy that not even our elected representatives are allowed to see.
[3:31:12.720 --> 3:31:18.720]  Later in life, Patrick Henry looked back and said, when the American spirit was in its youth, the language of America was different.
[3:31:18.720 --> 3:31:20.720]  Liberty, sir, was the primary object.
[3:31:20.720 --> 3:31:26.720]  Today, our primary concern is safety and comfort, when we should be demanding liberty.
[3:31:26.720 --> 3:31:33.720]  From ForWars.com, I'm David Knight.
[3:31:58.720 --> 3:32:07.720]  The elite are masters at poisoning our environment, while themselves doing things that mitigate or avoid most of the toxic effects for themselves.
[3:32:07.720 --> 3:32:09.720]  The general public doesn't.
[3:32:09.720 --> 3:32:13.720]  The Alexa pure breeze would be a steal at $300, $400, $500.
[3:32:13.720 --> 3:32:17.720]  One of these systems can keep 800 square feet incredibly clean.
[3:32:17.720 --> 3:32:23.720]  This is a system I'm personally putting in throughout my house, replacing older, more expensive filters that didn't do as good a job.
[3:32:23.720 --> 3:32:28.720]  Find out why this system is so revolutionary today at infowarstore.com.
[3:32:53.720 --> 3:32:56.720]  This is the book that got Roger Stone poisoned with polonium.
[3:32:56.720 --> 3:32:59.720]  It breaks down what really happened with the Russians and so much more.
[3:32:59.720 --> 3:33:02.720]  And it supports him and it supports info wars in our whole operation.
[3:33:02.720 --> 3:33:07.720]  So it's essential that this book go to the top of the charts in the political area, if not at the very top of the charts.
[3:33:07.720 --> 3:33:10.720]  Joe Biden has come out and said world government is collapsing.
[3:33:10.720 --> 3:33:11.720]  They're in full crisis mode.
[3:33:11.720 --> 3:33:13.720]  Nationalist movements are exploding.
[3:33:13.720 --> 3:33:15.720]  Everybody needs to go pre-order.
[3:33:15.720 --> 3:33:17.720]  So you get it first at infowarstore.com.
[3:33:17.720 --> 3:33:23.720]  The making of a president by Roger Stone. I'm Alex Jones. I'm going on airplane to go to the inaugural event with Trump.
[3:33:23.720 --> 3:33:27.720]  Pray for us and please continue to support the operation and get his book now.
[3:33:27.720 --> 3:33:29.720]  Sir, the first to have it shipped to you.
[3:33:36.720 --> 3:33:37.720]  Alex Jones.
[3:33:37.720 --> 3:33:39.720]  He was a nice guy actually. You like him?
[3:33:39.720 --> 3:33:43.720]  That's good. Alex was a nice guy.
[3:33:43.720 --> 3:33:50.720]  I know now from top people that you actually are for real and you understand you're in danger and you understand what you're doing.
[3:33:50.720 --> 3:33:54.720]  Your reputation is amazing. I will not let you down.
[3:33:54.720 --> 3:33:57.720]  You will be very, very impressed, I hope.
[3:33:57.720 --> 3:34:02.720]  And I think we'll be speaking a lot, but you'll be looking at me in a year or two years.
[3:34:02.720 --> 3:34:05.720]  Let's give me a little bit of time to run things.
[3:34:05.720 --> 3:34:09.720]  But a year into office, you'll be saying, wow, I remember that interview.
[3:34:09.720 --> 3:34:11.720]  He said he was going to do it and he did a great job.
[3:34:11.720 --> 3:34:13.720]  You'll be very proud of our country.
[3:34:13.720 --> 3:34:18.720]  So while we're there, you probably read it. It was a drudge. Who's great, by the way, drudge is amazing.
[3:34:18.720 --> 3:34:22.720]  But the story in drudge and big story, it's all over the place now.
[3:34:22.720 --> 3:34:30.720]  Guys swimming across and big bags of stuff, struts swimming across the river.
[3:34:30.720 --> 3:34:32.720]  Swimming right across.
[3:34:32.720 --> 3:34:37.720]  We just caught these guys coming across the border. They're jumping in. They just jumped in the rafts.
[3:34:37.720 --> 3:34:42.720]  They're coming up in one, two, three, four. They have big satchels.
[3:34:42.720 --> 3:34:48.720]  And actually the camera crew or the reporters were petrified because they thought they were going to be killed.
[3:34:48.720 --> 3:34:53.720]  Because they're showing this on camera. The guys were carrying bags of stuff. It was drugs.
[3:34:57.720 --> 3:34:59.720]  Thank you.
[3:34:59.720 --> 3:35:03.720]  Donald Trump, I hope you can help uncriple America. Thank you so much, sir.
[3:35:03.720 --> 3:35:06.720]  You will be attacked for coming on and we know you know that. Thank you.
[3:35:06.720 --> 3:35:08.720]  Thank you very much.
[3:35:08.720 --> 3:35:15.720]  Rallying patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty. It's Alex Jones.
[3:35:15.720 --> 3:35:22.720]  There's no evidence of widespread voter fraud, of course, but there is one website that's reported this claim, this baseless claim.
[3:35:22.720 --> 3:35:26.720]  And it's one that maybe, I don't know, does Trump rely on this for his news?
[3:35:26.720 --> 3:35:33.720]  Infowars is the brainchild of radio host Alex Jones, who Rolling Stone once called the most paranoid man in America.
[3:35:33.720 --> 3:35:37.720]  It's been a cozy relationship from the beginning.
[3:35:37.720 --> 3:35:43.720]  I will not let you down. You will be very, very impressed, I hope, and I think we'll be speaking a lot.
[3:35:43.720 --> 3:35:51.720]  Donald Trump and Alex Jones, the conservative conspiracy theorist and operator of the website Infowars,
[3:35:51.720 --> 3:35:55.720]  which seems to be a place where Trump gets a lot of his information.
[3:35:55.720 --> 3:35:58.720]  Doesn't it scary that the president-elect is listening to Infowars?
[3:35:58.720 --> 3:36:03.720]  Jones can take credit for spearheading some of the most outrageous theories on the Internet,
[3:36:03.720 --> 3:36:09.720]  from claims that 9-11 was a government conspiracy to the Sandy Hook shooting being faked.
[3:36:09.720 --> 3:36:16.720]  Jones has suggested that the 9-11 attacks and the Boston Marathon bombing were inside jobs by the U.S. government.
[3:36:16.720 --> 3:36:21.720]  And Infowars helped fuel the rumor that President Obama is an ISIS supporter.
[3:36:21.720 --> 3:36:23.720]  Obama is the leader of ISIS.
[3:36:23.720 --> 3:36:28.720]  ISIS is honoring President Obama.
[3:36:28.720 --> 3:36:31.720]  He is the founder of ISIS.
[3:36:31.720 --> 3:36:38.720]  Jones' theories reach tens of millions each month and are now often echoed by the next president of the United States.
[3:36:38.720 --> 3:36:44.720]  The man who's going to be president of the United States going, you know, following Infowars, talking about...
[3:36:44.720 --> 3:36:45.720]  I don't know anything.
[3:36:45.720 --> 3:36:46.720] ...which means it was an inside job.
[3:36:46.720 --> 3:36:52.720]  If Donald Trump based his voter fraud claim on what he read on Infowars, it wouldn't be the first time.
[3:36:52.720 --> 3:37:00.720]  In a move that could further fuel concern, Alice Jones, operator of the Infowars website, says Trump called to offer his gratitude.
[3:37:00.720 --> 3:37:05.720]  She said, listen, Alice, I just talked to the kings and queens of the world, world leaders, you name it.
[3:37:05.720 --> 3:37:09.720]  She said, it doesn't matter. I wanted to talk to you, to thank your audience, and I'll be on the next few weeks to thank them.
[3:37:09.720 --> 3:37:17.720]  When Trump argued that thousands and thousands of Muslims in New Jersey celebrated the 9-11 attacks, he tweeted a link to Infowars.
[3:37:17.720 --> 3:37:23.720]  When Jones posted this video entitled an emergency message to Donald Trump during the campaign...
[3:37:23.720 --> 3:37:36.720]  I am going to ask you to seriously think about making the issue of Hillary's election fraud in the primaries one of the central issues to defeating her in November.
[3:37:36.720 --> 3:37:39.720]  Trump had this to say a day later.
[3:37:39.720 --> 3:37:45.720]  I'm afraid the election is going to be rigged, I have to be honest, because I think my side was rigged.
[3:37:45.720 --> 3:37:52.720]  In the wake of the election, Jones, pushing a theory that despite the vote totals, Trump actually won the popular vote.
[3:37:52.720 --> 3:37:57.720]  Millions of illegals voting, at least five states being stolen for Hillary.
[3:37:57.720 --> 3:38:01.720]  We're talking five, six, seven, eight million people more.
[3:38:01.720 --> 3:38:06.720]  Voting for Trump, if you look at the evidence, in the popular vote than did.
[3:38:06.720 --> 3:38:09.720]  And Trump, tweeting just four days later, quote,
[3:38:09.720 --> 3:38:18.720]  In addition to winning the Electoral College in a landslide, I won the popular vote if you deduct the millions of people who voted illegally.
[3:38:18.720 --> 3:38:31.720]  I'll tell you, it is surreal to talk about issues here on air and then word-for-word hear Trump say it two days later.
[3:38:31.720 --> 3:38:33.720]  It is amazing.
[3:38:33.720 --> 3:38:40.720]  Where exactly does the president elect get his information? Most importantly, perhaps, where does he get his intelligence information?
[3:38:40.720 --> 3:38:46.720]  It remains to be seen whether the conspiracy-driven website remains a go-to for the president-elect.
[3:38:46.720 --> 3:38:54.720]  Your reputation is amazing. I will not let you down. You will be very, very impressed, I hope, and I think we'll be speaking a lot.
[3:38:54.720 --> 3:38:58.720]  Randy Kay, CNN, New York.
[3:38:58.720 --> 3:39:02.720]  Welcome back. I'm David Knight here at the Alex Jones radio show.
[3:39:02.720 --> 3:39:07.720]  We're going to have a lot of guests that are going to be coming up as part of our live coverage of Donald Trump's inauguration.
[3:39:07.720 --> 3:39:12.720]  We'll also be going to our reporters and Alex Jones, who are in Washington, D.C.
[3:39:12.720 --> 3:39:22.720]  Now, of course, Chicago's CBS affiliate is complaining, interestingly enough, about a California YMCA that is in Valparaiso,
[3:39:22.720 --> 3:39:28.720]  and they say that they took CNN off of their monitor. Why do you think that would happen?
[3:39:28.720 --> 3:39:33.720]  After looking at that report, after looking at the course, pull that up again. We talked about this briefly earlier.
[3:39:33.720 --> 3:39:41.720]  The video that they put up of Alex Jones with the lower thirds saying that he is a former KKK leader,
[3:39:41.720 --> 3:39:47.720]  that's what people are going to see if they're exercising in a YMCA.
[3:39:47.720 --> 3:39:53.720]  They're going to see, pull up that. You guys pulled that up earlier. We had that screen. There you go.
[3:39:53.720 --> 3:39:58.720]  If you're sitting there exercising, you're going to see CNN, you're going to see Alex Jones.
[3:39:58.720 --> 3:40:04.720]  You're not getting the audio, but it says, former KKK leader praises Trump for supporting Alex Jones host info wars.
[3:40:04.720 --> 3:40:08.720]  That's what they put up, breaking news.
[3:40:08.720 --> 3:40:15.720]  That is why I imagine they took that off. Somebody said, well, I think they switched to the cooking channel.
[3:40:15.720 --> 3:40:23.720]  Was that the spirit cooking channel? I don't know, but I think honestly, YMCA would not be putting up the spirit cooking channel.
[3:40:23.720 --> 3:40:30.720]  That's what CNN would do. We also have quite a number of documents that Donald Trump signed,
[3:40:30.720 --> 3:40:36.720]  and we have reports coming up. People are not sure exactly at this moment what all the papers that Donald Trump signed,
[3:40:36.720 --> 3:40:42.720]  but he sat there for quite some time as we had the live feed, the pool network feed,
[3:40:42.720 --> 3:40:51.720]  was showing him signing paper after paper after paper. We know that one of those was authorizing General Mattis to accept a cabinet position
[3:40:51.720 --> 3:40:56.720]  because there's a moratorium by law that you had to be gone for a certain amount of time. He did not meet that time limit.
[3:40:56.720 --> 3:41:03.720]  So they were waiving that time limit for him, but it's unclear what the other executive orders were as of this moment.
[3:41:03.720 --> 3:41:09.720]  But one of the things that I want to take a look at, and we've got a video here where we're looking at Trump,
[3:41:09.720 --> 3:41:15.720]  ISIS oil, and the relationship with Putin, Donald Trump said this in the inaugural speech.
[3:41:15.720 --> 3:41:26.720]  He said, we will reinforce old alliances and we will form new ones, and we will unite the civilized world against radical Islamic terrorism,
[3:41:26.720 --> 3:41:30.720]  which we will eradicate from the face of the earth.
[3:41:30.720 --> 3:41:37.720]  Think about the fact that we just had a president as well as mainstream media press corps who could not bring themselves
[3:41:37.720 --> 3:41:46.720]  to ever use the term radical Islamic terrorism, even when the radical Islamic terrorists were taking credit for what they did
[3:41:46.720 --> 3:41:54.720]  and saying we did it in the name of Islam. We just drove this truck or shot these people or blew up this building here.
[3:41:54.720 --> 3:42:02.720]  We did that in the name of radical Islam. They could not even address what it was, even when the people themselves were taking credit for it,
[3:42:02.720 --> 3:42:10.720]  even when it was clear from videos that they had shot beforehand or diaries that they had left, what their motivation was.
[3:42:10.720 --> 3:42:14.720]  They would not even tell us the truth. They would not call it what it was.
[3:42:14.720 --> 3:42:17.720]  He's going to call it what it is, and he's going to move against it.
[3:42:17.720 --> 3:42:24.720]  I want to go back and play this report here about Trump, ISIS oil, and the relationship with Putin as we look at the fact that he's going to be
[3:42:24.720 --> 3:42:33.720]  building new relationships as well as old relationships. Donald Trump said, look, the problem with NATO isn't just the fact that it is set up for,
[3:42:33.720 --> 3:42:42.720]  let's hope that it is an obsolete idea, the Cold War, the military industrial complex, Barack Obama, the Hollywood people who are out there
[3:42:42.720 --> 3:42:48.720]  like Robert De Niro all are pushing, let's go to war with Russia. Let's revive these tensions.
[3:42:48.720 --> 3:42:54.720]  No, let's have détente. Let's ease the tensions. Let's give peace a chance.
[3:42:54.720 --> 3:42:59.720]  Okay, but they don't want that. They want to revive that. Donald Trump says, look, NATO was set up to deal with the Cold War.
[3:42:59.720 --> 3:43:08.720]  That's not really the threat we're facing right now. The threat we're facing is radical Islamic terror, and NATO has been completely ineffective with that.
[3:43:08.720 --> 3:43:11.720]  That may be why we need to have some new alliances, wouldn't it?
[3:43:11.720 --> 3:43:18.720]  And he also pointed out, oh, by the way, not only is it an effective, not only is it targeted for an obsolete threat,
[3:43:18.720 --> 3:43:23.720]  but the people that are a part of it don't even want to pay for it. That should tell you something.
[3:43:23.720 --> 3:43:28.720]  If they're not willing to put any money into the support of NATO, maybe they don't believe that it's effective either.
[3:43:28.720 --> 3:43:34.720]  All these people who are wringing their hands in Europe and saying, this is a problem, maybe it isn't a problem.
[3:43:34.720 --> 3:43:38.720]  We need to look at all of this stuff anew. We need to look at these trade deals that we have.
[3:43:38.720 --> 3:43:45.720]  We need to look at the alliances that we have, these institutions that have been put in place for 50, 60 years,
[3:43:45.720 --> 3:43:48.720]  and we need to re-evaluate them from time to time, don't you think?
[3:43:48.720 --> 3:43:53.720]  That's what Donald Trump is doing. He's a fresh breath of air that is coming in.
[3:43:53.720 --> 3:43:58.720]  Let's take a look at this report where he looks at ISIS oil and the relationship with Putin.
[3:43:58.720 --> 3:44:01.720]  One thing with the oil it sits over in, because you've covered it.
[3:44:01.720 --> 3:44:04.720]  For three years, I've been saying hit the oil because ISIS is getting strong.
[3:44:04.720 --> 3:44:08.720]  They know JV, as the president said, and they're certainly not contained.
[3:44:08.720 --> 3:44:12.720]  But I said hit the oil and hit them hard, and they left at me.
[3:44:12.720 --> 3:44:16.720]  And they would put generals on television saying, no, that strategy wouldn't work.
[3:44:16.720 --> 3:44:19.720]  Well, after Paris, they started hitting the oil, and it does work.
[3:44:19.720 --> 3:44:23.720]  The problem is we've given them a two-year edge. They have billions of dollars.
[3:44:23.720 --> 3:44:27.720]  The Russians started hitting the oil for one month, and ISIS is already rolling over.
[3:44:27.720 --> 3:44:31.720]  So Putin is following your strategy. You know Vladimir Putin well.
[3:44:31.720 --> 3:44:34.720]  We should have done it two years ago, Alex. That's the only problem.
[3:44:34.720 --> 3:44:39.720]  Donald Trump joined us live. Can you speak to, as president, what your relationship would be with foreign leaders
[3:44:39.720 --> 3:44:46.720]  and what you know about Vladimir Putin? Because all I know is, why are we starting a fight with Russia when they're not doing anything to us?
[3:44:46.720 --> 3:44:51.720]  Right. Well, number one, and just to finish on the other way, I say hit the oil, but we should keep the oil.
[3:44:51.720 --> 3:44:55.720]  In other words, we should keep. We'll get ExxonMobil, the go-in. We'll get other of our oil companies.
[3:44:55.720 --> 3:44:58.720]  We'll get some of the great oil companies. We bid it out. We should keep the oil.
[3:44:58.720 --> 3:45:01.720]  You know, the old days to the victory belong to spoils, right? We don't have that.
[3:45:01.720 --> 3:45:07.720]  We go in, we fight a war, and we leave. We get nothing, except we get debt, and we get deficit. That's all we get.
[3:45:07.720 --> 3:45:13.720]  I think I get along great with people. I mean, I will probably get along well with them, and if I don't, somebody else will.
[3:45:13.720 --> 3:45:16.720]  And who knows? You know, he's a difficult cookie. He's tough and he's smart.
[3:45:16.720 --> 3:45:21.720]  I was on the show 60 minutes with him recently, not together.
[3:45:21.720 --> 3:45:25.720]  I mean, they did him and they profiled me at the same show, which was there. We were stablemates, right?
[3:45:25.720 --> 3:45:29.720]  But I think I get along very well with them. I think it's too fine.
[3:45:29.720 --> 3:45:33.720]  Look, here's the thing. We lose with every country, and yet we don't get along with any countries.
[3:45:33.720 --> 3:45:38.720]  China is killing us. Everybody's killing us. China is just beating us to a pulp and trade.
[3:45:38.720 --> 3:45:42.720]  Japan, Mexico is killing us. And yet we don't get along with anybody.
[3:45:42.720 --> 3:45:46.720]  With me, they're not going to get so rich. Believe me, they're not going to get so rich at all.
[3:45:46.720 --> 3:45:50.720]  We're going to take back our jobs. We're going to take back our manufacture. We take back our base.
[3:45:50.720 --> 3:45:55.720]  But they'll like us more than they do now.
[3:45:55.720 --> 3:46:00.720]  And again, that was Donald Trump as he was interviewed by Alex Jones on our show.
[3:46:00.720 --> 3:46:04.720]  He says, maybe we should keep the oil. Well, you know who is keeping the oil?
[3:46:04.720 --> 3:46:06.720]  ISIS is keeping the oil.
[3:46:06.720 --> 3:46:14.720]  Remember, we talked about the fact that Barack Obama has dropped like 25,000 bombs in that area that ISIS controls?
[3:46:14.720 --> 3:46:23.720]  And Russia pointed out, you know, isn't it interesting that not one single bomb out of those 25,000 that you dropped landed on an ISIS oil field?
[3:46:23.720 --> 3:46:34.720]  And of course, we see convoys of trucks that are carrying ISIS oil freely going back and forth from the oil fields into Turkey, never attacked.
[3:46:34.720 --> 3:46:42.720]  Even though the media can get video of that, and our satellites apparently don't know that it's there, they can't get any drones there.
[3:46:42.720 --> 3:46:51.720]  Isn't that curious? Isn't it curious, as we pointed out at the very beginning of this years ago, all of the convoy of small Toyota pickup trucks.
[3:46:51.720 --> 3:46:57.720]  You know, the Hilux trucks that just keep going and going and going, you know, they have ready trucks that the terrorists love to use.
[3:46:57.720 --> 3:47:01.720]  There are these convoys and people just setting up on top of them, driving around.
[3:47:01.720 --> 3:47:06.720]  They're not in tanks or anything. This is a bunch of yahoo's with Arabic headbands on.
[3:47:06.720 --> 3:47:09.720]  And nobody did anything to attack those convoys.
[3:47:09.720 --> 3:47:20.720]  And yet, we have situations where miraculously, even though we can't drop any bombs on them, we somehow mistakenly drop arms and parachute those down to the ISIS people.
[3:47:20.720 --> 3:47:27.720]  Oh, that was a mistake. Didn't mean to do that. Didn't mean to clear out and leave behind an entire arsenal for ISIS.
[3:47:27.720 --> 3:47:32.720]  We didn't mean to bring in this Chechen Islamic terrorist that had been attacking Russia.
[3:47:32.720 --> 3:47:38.720]  We didn't mean to bring him in from Chechnya as our surrogate into ISIS, did we?
[3:47:38.720 --> 3:47:49.720]  They tried to push that war and we pushed back very hard against that narrative that only the Syrian government could have launched that sarin gas attack against the civilians.
[3:47:49.720 --> 3:47:56.720]  We said that's a lie. That's not true. This has happened before and we had UN weapons inspectors.
[3:47:56.720 --> 3:48:03.720]  We had Russian inspectors and eventually American military came in and said, no, that's not true.
[3:48:03.720 --> 3:48:12.720]  That could have been done by anyone. It didn't have to be done by the Syrian army. That is not a pretext for going to war that we should be paying attention to.
[3:48:12.720 --> 3:48:16.720]  We had soldiers holding up signs saying we're not going to be al-Qaeda's air force.
[3:48:16.720 --> 3:48:20.720]  We had Ron Paul saying that and Rand Paul saying that we're not going to be al-Qaeda's air force.
[3:48:20.720 --> 3:48:24.720]  So we did not get involved with the ground war in Syria at that time.
[3:48:24.720 --> 3:48:31.720]  We pushed back against that. Now we have a president who understands that lie, who understands what they were trying to do.
[3:48:31.720 --> 3:48:40.720]  We've got another clip that I want to play for you. Another commentary, Donald Trump and ISIS. Let's go to that next report here.
[3:48:40.720 --> 3:48:50.720]  Strong military and we don't want to have to use it. Ideally, we don't have to use it, although we will destroy ISIS.
[3:48:50.720 --> 3:49:05.720]  At the same time, we will pursue a new foreign policy that finally learns from the mistakes of the past.
[3:49:05.720 --> 3:49:11.720]  We will stop looking to topple regimes and overthrow governments, folks.
[3:49:11.720 --> 3:49:22.720]  Remember $6 trillion, $6 trillion in the Middle East. $6 trillion. Our goal is stability, not chaos.
[3:49:22.720 --> 3:49:29.720]  Because we want to rebuild our country. It's time. It's time.
[3:49:29.720 --> 3:49:41.720]  We will partner with any nation that is willing to join us in the effort to defeat ISIS and radical Islamic terrorism.
[3:49:41.720 --> 3:49:45.720]  Okay, we have to say the term. Have to say the term.
[3:49:45.720 --> 3:49:53.720]  That was Donald Trump at one of his stump speeches. You heard that. We have to use the term radical Islamic terrorism.
[3:49:53.720 --> 3:50:00.720]  He used it again today. He said the same things today that he was saying when he ran for office. Isn't that refreshing?
[3:50:00.720 --> 3:50:07.720]  Even though we've had in the wake of his election, we've had nothing but mainstream media saying, seriously, you can't truly believe that.
[3:50:07.720 --> 3:50:12.720]  You can't really mean what you say. You can't really be doing this. This isn't really happening.
[3:50:12.720 --> 3:50:16.720]  Donald Trump can't be our president. Well, he is. He is our president now.
[3:50:16.720 --> 3:50:26.720]  He said today, we will reinforce old alliances, form new ones and unite the civilized world against radical Islamic terrorism, which we will eradicate from the face of the earth.
[3:50:26.720 --> 3:50:33.720]  He's not afraid to use the term. Some of the key mistakes that we made in the past were that we could not even use that term.
[3:50:33.720 --> 3:50:40.720]  All right, let's go to, we've got one more report here that I want to run as we were running that report.
[3:50:40.720 --> 3:50:47.720]  Actually, we've got just a little bit of time before we go to break. I want to remind you, as we have crew in the field in Washington, D.C.,
[3:50:47.720 --> 3:50:56.720]  you can support the Info Wars operation by the sales that we have here at Info Wars, and we've put a new sale on for the inauguration.
[3:50:56.720 --> 3:51:05.720]  That's 30 to 40% off Info Wars select storeable food. If you want to prepare for an uncertain future, if you want to prepare for bad weather, you know,
[3:51:05.720 --> 3:51:11.720]  in spite of manmade global warming, we had massive ice storms and snow and the shelves emptied.
[3:51:11.720 --> 3:51:16.720]  If you want to protect yourself against that, protect yourself against unexpected price increases,
[3:51:16.720 --> 3:51:26.720]  freeze your price and get it at 30 to 40% off that food last for 25 years, all made in America, non-GMO, great packaging, and it is resealable once you open it.

[3:54:28.720 --> 3:54:47.720]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones show. I'm David Knight and we're looking at the Trump inauguration.
[3:54:47.720 --> 3:54:53.720]  The parade is about to begin. Right now we just have a color guard and the police going down.
[3:54:53.720 --> 3:54:58.720]  But there's going to be more of a parade. As this develops we have some guests coming up.
[3:54:58.720 --> 3:55:01.720]  Leigh Ann McAdoo is going to be taking over in the next segment.
[3:55:01.720 --> 3:55:05.720]  She's going to have Adam Curry I believe joining her as we come up.
[3:55:05.720 --> 3:55:08.720]  But just to point out that this is a global movement.
[3:55:08.720 --> 3:55:11.720]  Of course Donald Trump is at the forefront of this.
[3:55:11.720 --> 3:55:13.720]  But just to show this is a global movement.
[3:55:13.720 --> 3:55:18.720]  We've seen in the last day news come out of Britain that they're going to be setting up.
[3:55:18.720 --> 3:55:24.720]  A lot of money who spent more money than anyone has ever spent on British politics.
[3:55:24.720 --> 3:55:28.720]  A millionaire there in Britain is going to be funding a website.
[3:55:28.720 --> 3:55:31.720]  A news aggregation website as well as content generation.
[3:55:31.720 --> 3:55:33.720]  They're going to call it West Monster.
[3:55:33.720 --> 3:55:37.720]  Because of course Westminster is the way they refer to their government there.
[3:55:37.720 --> 3:55:42.720]  As we would refer to Capitol Hill they talk about Westminster the physical seat of government.
[3:55:42.720 --> 3:55:44.720]  So they're going to call it West Monster.
[3:55:44.720 --> 3:55:48.720]  It is going to be a news aggregation site is also going to have original content.
[3:55:48.720 --> 3:55:52.720]  Their very first article is going to be an op-ed piece by Nigel Farage.
[3:55:52.720 --> 3:55:56.720]  And of course Nigel Farage was in the United States for the inauguration.
[3:55:56.720 --> 3:56:00.720]  He said Donald Trump is Brexit plus.
[3:56:00.720 --> 3:56:04.720]  And he said being in the room with Donald Trump makes me feel like an introvert.
[3:56:04.720 --> 3:56:10.720]  And of course now news comes out that Nigel Farage is going to become a commentator on Fox News.
[3:56:10.720 --> 3:56:17.720]  And at the same time this is happening we see leaders from France, from Denmark I believe it was.
[3:56:17.720 --> 3:56:19.720]  All meeting in Germany.
[3:56:19.720 --> 3:56:25.720]  And of course these are the people that the mainstream media loves to demonize as the far right.
[3:56:25.720 --> 3:56:29.720]  You'll notice they never call these people that are here attacking women.
[3:56:29.720 --> 3:56:33.720]  They never call them the far left. They never call them the radical left.
[3:56:33.720 --> 3:56:35.720]  Just like they can't talk about radical Islam.
[3:56:35.720 --> 3:56:40.720]  They never call them in terms radical extremist socialist left.
[3:56:40.720 --> 3:56:45.720]  And as Rob do pointed out, hey you guys want to call everybody Nazis and say they're right wing fascists.
[3:56:45.720 --> 3:56:50.720]  Remember that Adolf Hitler called himself a national socialist.
[3:56:50.720 --> 3:56:56.720]  He just approached authoritarianism and dictatorship from a different angle.
[3:56:56.720 --> 3:57:00.720]  He marketed it differently than Stalin. They were not polar opposites.
[3:57:00.720 --> 3:57:09.720]  They were a political spectrum. Don't look at a flat line with Stalin on the left and extreme left and Adolf Hitler on extreme right.
[3:57:09.720 --> 3:57:11.720]  Now look at a two dimensional space.
[3:57:11.720 --> 3:57:14.720]  Pull up the Nolan chart guys.
[3:57:14.720 --> 3:57:18.720]  This is one of the founders of the Libertarian Party and he really mapped this out.
[3:57:18.720 --> 3:57:26.720]  He took a grid and he mapped out people's positions on economic issues, economic freedom, as well as political freedom.
[3:57:26.720 --> 3:57:28.720]  Civil liberties as we're told, right?
[3:57:28.720 --> 3:57:33.720]  So down at the origin you would have neither political freedom nor economic freedom.
[3:57:33.720 --> 3:57:38.720]  And they took that chart, normally you see a chart, he rotated it 45 degrees if you're looking at that.
[3:57:38.720 --> 3:57:40.720]  I'm trying to describe this for people who are not watching it.
[3:57:40.720 --> 3:57:42.720]  Rotate it 45 degrees so you got a diamond.
[3:57:42.720 --> 3:57:48.720]  So down at the bottom, that is no economic freedom, no civil liberties freedom.
[3:57:48.720 --> 3:57:50.720]  That's the authoritarian quadrant.
[3:57:50.720 --> 3:57:53.720]  That's where both Adolf Hitler and Joseph Stalin are.
[3:57:53.720 --> 3:57:55.720]  Now they came at it from different directions.
[3:57:55.720 --> 3:57:58.720]  Adolf Hitler said, Stalin made a mistake.
[3:57:58.720 --> 3:58:01.720]  He nationalized the industries first so he weakened himself.
[3:58:01.720 --> 3:58:04.720]  I'm going to leave them under government control.
[3:58:04.720 --> 3:58:06.720]  That's fascism, that's economic fascism.
[3:58:06.720 --> 3:58:09.720]  Fascism isn't just extreme nationalism.
[3:58:09.720 --> 3:58:14.720]  It is also retaining control of these corporations which you know,
[3:58:14.720 --> 3:58:19.720]  crony capitalism and private public partnerships, they start to get pretty close to that.
[3:58:19.720 --> 3:58:25.720]  That's what we need to guard against as we start to move towards undoing the globalists.
[3:58:25.720 --> 3:58:31.720]  We need to be careful about private public partnerships because that can be a kind of crony capitalism, a kind of fascism.
[3:58:31.720 --> 3:58:38.720]  But to keep control of those, to let them be vital, to let them still operate as a business's profit,
[3:58:38.720 --> 3:58:44.720]  Hitler was right when he said that made him stronger whereas Stalin eviscerated these by taking them over with the government.
[3:58:44.720 --> 3:58:48.720]  That's what we saw in Central America with Venezuela and Hugo Chavez and others.
[3:58:48.720 --> 3:58:50.720]  That kind of corruption.
[3:58:50.720 --> 3:58:54.720]  The bottom line, folks, is that the authoritarians don't want you to have any freedom.
[3:58:54.720 --> 3:58:56.720]  They don't want you to have any free speech.
[3:58:56.720 --> 3:59:00.720]  They're not exercising free speech when they punch you in the face.
[3:59:00.720 --> 3:59:19.720]  Stay with us. We're going to be right back with Leanne McAdoo and guests.
[3:59:19.720 --> 3:59:26.720]  We're selling a product, DNA Force, that is the very best nutraceutical that we can produce.
[3:59:26.720 --> 3:59:29.720]  Dr. Griff, you took years for you to develop DNA Force for us.
[3:59:29.720 --> 3:59:35.720]  It's been something that I've been working on for a long time, Alex, because I think it's very, very important.
[3:59:35.720 --> 3:59:41.720]  What the aging process is, is when the cell replicates, we lose a little bit of our telomeres.
[3:59:41.720 --> 3:59:44.720]  Telomeres are the little cups on the end of our chromosomes.
[3:59:44.720 --> 3:59:46.720]  And when it runs out, you start dying.
[3:59:46.720 --> 3:59:50.720]  We chose the PQQ because it has over 175 different clinical trials.
[3:59:50.720 --> 3:59:53.720]  It's one of the most effective substances in the world.
[3:59:53.720 --> 3:59:58.720]  It works like an antioxidant. It works to repair nerve growth factor.
[3:59:58.720 --> 4:00:02.720]  So this is a formula to deliver the maximum amount. It's in powder form.
[4:00:02.720 --> 4:00:07.720]  We have so many five-star reviews. I take this. This is the product that I take.
