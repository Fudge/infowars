[00:00.000 --> 00:10.000]  We're here to take on the anti-humans.
[00:10.000 --> 00:27.000]  Defending the republic from enemies, foreign, and domestic, it's Alex Jones.
[00:27.000 --> 00:34.000]  We're here to take on the anti-human blood-sucking pedophile vampire New World Order trash.
[00:34.000 --> 00:40.000]  We've come to chew bubblegum and to kick ass.
[00:40.000 --> 00:43.000]  And guess what? I'm all out of bubblegum.
[00:43.000 --> 00:47.000]  To quote the great rowdy rowdy piper, a patriot, and listener of the show.
[00:47.000 --> 00:51.000]  Just to show how popular freedom is.
[00:51.000 --> 00:58.000]  Well, I gotta tell you, to say that Info Wars is on fire is an understatement.
[00:58.000 --> 01:04.000]  If we were fire, we'd be squared.
[01:04.000 --> 01:13.000]  Next level. All the years, all the preparation, all the building, all the tribulations have only made us battle-harden.
[01:13.000 --> 01:21.000]  And every reporter and the crew and the security people has just done a 100% job.
[01:21.000 --> 01:29.000]  Everything fell into place and everything we did was wildly successful and game-changing and national news.
[01:29.000 --> 01:34.000]  Taking over deep state narratives that gun owners were going to cause a giant murderous bloodbath,
[01:34.000 --> 01:41.000]  turned it around on them, educated the folks about how the governor was trying to cause a false flag and coming for people's guns.
[01:41.000 --> 01:45.000]  Everything happened with the women's march, how it's run by Soros, how it's been to divide the family.
[01:45.000 --> 01:49.000]  We totally took that over and got the majority of the coverage.
[01:49.000 --> 01:53.000]  $100 million Soros spent on that, he admits. We took it over.
[01:53.000 --> 02:02.000]  Boom! During the whole kickoff of the trial, Info Wars is on the ground showing how the anti-Trump demonstrators don't even know who they are.
[02:02.000 --> 02:07.000]  They're there, they're paid, they're astroturfed, they admit it. That's been national news.
[02:07.000 --> 02:15.000]  I've just got to say, the listeners, the viewers, the supporters have provisioned us, have supported us, have given us the intel,
[02:15.000 --> 02:19.000]  have given us the prayers, and you have put us on the field.
[02:19.000 --> 02:31.000]  And as the late great Theodore Roosevelt said, a man in the arena, even if he fails, at least failed while trying and daring greatly,
[02:31.000 --> 02:35.000]  he'll never be amongst those timid spectators who only make comments from the stands.
[02:35.000 --> 02:39.000]  But when you dare and dare greatly and win, it is legend.
[02:39.000 --> 02:45.000]  And I can tell you right now, they could wipe us out next week, and what we've done has already been legend together.
[02:45.000 --> 02:49.000]  That means you, the viewers and listeners, are literally this operation.
[02:49.000 --> 02:56.000]  And we have done this, you have done this, and so I salute you, and I thank you all.
[02:56.000 --> 03:00.000]  Now, we've got some big challenges coming up, and we're going to break it down on the next segment.
[03:00.000 --> 03:05.000]  I'm going to read that man in arena quote, since they put up on screen here in a moment.
[03:05.000 --> 03:10.000]  But the curveball is the stock market, and could they crash it to take Trump out?
[03:10.000 --> 03:25.000]  The other big curveball is this coronavirus that, did you know, just a month and four days ago, it got patented and certified with a vaccine,
[03:25.000 --> 03:33.000]  and lo and behold, the exact same virus pops up about a week later and starts spreading.
[03:33.000 --> 03:36.000]  That's just amazing, isn't it?
[03:36.000 --> 03:41.000]  They just approved live Ebola vaccine as well, so get ready for the fun there.
[03:41.000 --> 03:45.000]  That's coming up just so much to break down.
[03:45.000 --> 03:48.000]  Now Brazil is going after Glen Greenwald.
[03:48.000 --> 03:49.000]  Why not?
[03:49.000 --> 03:56.000]  America is not standing up for Julian Assange, very dangerous, a real black mark on the leader of Brazil,
[03:56.000 --> 03:59.000]  and on Trump that he's done nothing so far, really a problem.
[03:59.000 --> 04:02.000]  But let's end this segment with something positive.
[04:02.000 --> 04:10.000]  The man in the arena, back on screen please if you can, because I don't want to butcher what Mr. Roosevelt had to say.
[04:10.000 --> 04:15.000]  It is not the critic who challenged, not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles,
[04:15.000 --> 04:21.000]  or where the doer of deeds could have done them better, the credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena,
[04:21.000 --> 04:27.000]  whose face is marred by dust, sweat, and blood, and then it goes on to the rest of the quote,
[04:27.000 --> 04:31.000]  but that really does say it all, and Info Wars is in the arena.
[04:31.000 --> 04:35.000]  I mean, whenever Michael Savage came on, he does do other people's shows, he said,
[04:35.000 --> 04:41.000]  Alex Jones, you are the gladiator, because I fight every day in the arena,
[04:41.000 --> 04:47.000]  but it's the audience, it's the crew, it's the people that make all this possible,
[04:47.000 --> 04:52.000]  that truly are the individuals in the arena.
[04:52.000 --> 04:59.000]  So it's all coming up today on this live Wednesday, January 22nd, transmission.
[04:59.000 --> 05:03.000]  Hey, you there. We have a problem.
[05:03.000 --> 05:06.000]  You see, there is a baby.
[05:06.000 --> 05:10.000]  The mother of this baby is not sure she's ready.
[05:10.000 --> 05:14.000]  The father of this baby doesn't want to settle down.
[05:14.000 --> 05:17.000]  The mother starts to have regrets.
[05:17.000 --> 05:24.000]  The father considers leaving town, but a friend says there's a solution.
[05:24.000 --> 05:28.000]  She says to have an abortion.
[05:28.000 --> 05:30.000]  The mother decides to look into it.
[05:30.000 --> 05:33.000]  The clinic assures her it's safe.
[05:33.000 --> 05:35.000]  She's made her decision.
[05:35.000 --> 05:37.000]  She's going to have an abortion.
[05:37.000 --> 05:43.000]  The problem is that baby is you.
[05:43.000 --> 05:52.000]  Join me, Owen Schreuer, at the March for Life, Friday, January 24th, in Washington, DC, noon at the National Mall.
[05:52.000 --> 05:56.000]  I'll see you there. It's time to stand up for the unborn.
[05:56.000 --> 06:08.000]  It's time to speak out for the voiceless.
[06:27.000 --> 06:31.000]  Look at them yoyos. That's the way you do it.
[06:31.000 --> 06:35.000]  You play the guitar on MTV.
[06:35.000 --> 06:38.000]  I ain't working. That's the way you do it.
[06:38.000 --> 06:40.000]  Money for nothing.
[06:40.000 --> 06:42.000]  We are back live.
[06:42.000 --> 06:45.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, broadcasting worldwide.
[06:45.000 --> 06:48.000]  And I am your host, Alex Jones.
[06:48.000 --> 06:54.000]  And we are going to be here live or willing for the next four hours.
[06:54.000 --> 06:59.000]  And then Owen Schreuer from DC with Savannah Hernandez and the rest of the crew will be hosting things live.
[06:59.000 --> 07:09.000]  And anytime there's anything interesting that we're watching with the entire kickoff of day two of the Trump-Trump Senate,
[07:09.000 --> 07:11.000]  we will be covering it live here on air.
[07:11.000 --> 07:18.000]  We also have live feeds at band.video whenever we go live on our own platform, on our own system,
[07:18.000 --> 07:25.000]  so that it's much harder for the establishment to shut us down and much harder for the system to block us.
[07:25.000 --> 07:29.000]  There's a big story up on infowars.com.
[07:29.000 --> 07:34.000]  Also, the Gateway Pundit and many others picked it up.
[07:34.000 --> 07:44.000]  Stunning YouTube takes down judicial watch and right-side broadcasting impeachment feed want to drive viewers to liberal feeds.
[07:44.000 --> 07:45.000]  Well, it's worse than that.
[07:45.000 --> 07:53.000]  Breitbart is reporting that their pro-gun feeds just showing the speeches in the rally from Virginia were killed.
[07:53.000 --> 08:01.000]  This is even when judicial watch and right-side pay as part of the pool have a network feed.
[08:01.000 --> 08:06.000]  You can pay $100, $500, $10,000 for an NFL feed.
[08:06.000 --> 08:08.000]  You can't lease that.
[08:08.000 --> 08:16.000]  But almost all feeds you can pay, and depending on how valuable they think they are and who you are, who you're going to feed it to,
[08:16.000 --> 08:19.000]  by law they have to basically license it to you.
[08:19.000 --> 08:27.000]  Well, they went and leased the feeds from Congress, from C-SPAN, that oversees that.
[08:27.000 --> 08:30.000]  That's why you'll look at ABC, CBS, NBC, Fox.
[08:30.000 --> 08:34.000]  It's the same shot of the State of the Union as the cameras cut around.
[08:34.000 --> 08:39.000]  Well, imagine you go lease that, you go pay for that.
[08:39.000 --> 08:42.000]  We've done it before ourselves at events.
[08:42.000 --> 08:53.000]  And YouTube and others just say, no, we're not going to let you lease a feed and pick up the feed and run it.
[08:53.000 --> 08:56.000]  They call it fake news.
[08:56.000 --> 09:03.000]  They described it as violating community standards.
[09:03.000 --> 09:08.000]  So those are NationalFall.com and GatewayPundit.com articles on that.
[09:08.000 --> 09:16.000]  And I just keep warning everybody, Judicial Watch is a powerful group of lawyers that have done an amazing job exposing the deep state.
[09:16.000 --> 09:30.000]  And the deep state is so arrogant and so brazen that they believe that they can take judicial watches feed away.
[09:30.000 --> 09:34.000]  So two years ago, it's Alex Jones.
[09:34.000 --> 09:38.000]  And now it's Judicial Watch.
[09:38.000 --> 09:45.000]  You see, Big Tech doesn't care if you sue them because Google's worth almost a trillion dollars.
[09:45.000 --> 09:47.000]  Apple's worth more than a trillion dollars.
[09:47.000 --> 09:49.000]  Tesla's worth over a hundred million dollars.
[09:49.000 --> 09:52.000]  The system doesn't care.
[09:52.000 --> 10:01.000]  It's like when AP ran that I lost a lawsuit for writing a book called Nobody Died at Sandy Hook, which I never wrote or am in.
[10:01.000 --> 10:05.000]  And we had lawyers call them and they just said, sue us.
[10:05.000 --> 10:07.000]  We had letters sent and they said, sue us.
[10:07.000 --> 10:11.000]  We don't care because I could find them for two, three years, spend millions of dollars and win millions.
[10:11.000 --> 10:13.000]  They don't care.
[10:13.000 --> 10:18.000]  They'll just pay it out.
[10:18.000 --> 10:21.000]  That's a dangerous situation, isn't it?
[10:21.000 --> 10:23.000]  And Congress and the president need to act.
[10:23.000 --> 10:25.000]  My God.
[10:25.000 --> 10:30.000]  Mitch McConnell had people in his house say, we're going to kill you Nazi turtle.
[10:30.000 --> 10:32.000]  We're going to stab you.
[10:32.000 --> 10:34.000]  And Twitter let them do it.
[10:34.000 --> 10:38.000]  Well, Mitch McConnell's own site pointed out it was wrong, his own Twitter.
[10:38.000 --> 10:42.000]  They deleted his comment and shut his Twitter down for a couple of days.
[10:42.000 --> 10:44.000]  Did turtle do anything?
[10:44.000 --> 10:46.000]  No, he didn't do anything.
[10:46.000 --> 10:52.000]  And that's dangerous because modern communication is Facebook, is YouTube, is Twitter, is Instagram.
[10:52.000 --> 10:54.000]  It's how almost everybody communicates now.
[10:54.000 --> 10:56.000]  People don't pick a telephone up.
[10:56.000 --> 11:01.000]  Most people including myself don't even pick the phone up.
[11:01.000 --> 11:06.000]  You just send a text message or you send a voice message.
[11:06.000 --> 11:08.000]  That's how most communication is now.
[11:08.000 --> 11:14.000]  And now CNN member six months ago said, we're looking into banning Jones off of text messages.
[11:14.000 --> 11:17.000]  We're trying to find out what platform he's on.
[11:17.000 --> 11:21.000]  If he's using WhatsApp and then Facebook came out and said, no, we checked.
[11:21.000 --> 11:22.000]  He doesn't.
[11:22.000 --> 11:25.000]  But if he tries to use private messenger with us, we'll ban him there.
[11:25.000 --> 11:33.000]  And now Brazil Facebook is using it to block people there that support Balasaro.
[11:33.000 --> 11:35.000]  Balasaro doesn't even get it.
[11:35.000 --> 11:38.000]  He's trying to have green wall put in prison for journalism.
[11:38.000 --> 11:43.000]  So this is a dangerous situation and violations of free speech and violations of communication run across
[11:43.000 --> 11:49.000]  party lines worldwide, Republican, Democrat, liberal, conservative, Tory labor.
[11:49.000 --> 11:54.000]  And it's just Trump's greatest failing is not standing up for the bedrock of this country.
[11:54.000 --> 12:00.000]  It's the First Amendment along these big, mega powerful combines to get together and do this.
[12:00.000 --> 12:08.000]  What they don't want is people tuning in to see the impeachment feed on a Breitbart or an
[12:08.000 --> 12:14.000]  info wars or a right side or a judicial watch to see in the modern age, everybody's figuring
[12:14.000 --> 12:19.000]  out, wait a minute, I could just pay a couple hundred bucks to cease being or to Congress
[12:19.000 --> 12:23.000]  and they'll just give me the feed and then I can carry it.
[12:23.000 --> 12:26.000]  And CNN is always behind the censorship.
[12:26.000 --> 12:32.000]  You know, it was a Oliver Darcy or one of those guys called up YouTube and said, they've got the
[12:32.000 --> 12:37.000]  contacts at the top of it and said, what are you doing letting judicial watch run this?
[12:37.000 --> 12:44.000]  Just like they did to us because they don't want after hours of coverage to cut to judicial
[12:44.000 --> 12:45.000]  watches commentary.
[12:45.000 --> 12:49.000]  They want you to only see CNN's commentary and it's racketeering.
[12:49.000 --> 12:50.000]  It's organized crime.
[12:50.000 --> 12:55.000]  If any other group was organized with another business to shut down everybody else and coordinating
[12:55.000 --> 12:58.000]  to do it, they'd be shut down from monopolistic practices.
[12:58.000 --> 13:00.000]  They'd have injunctions followed in their ass.
[13:00.000 --> 13:05.000]  They end up in prison for criminal racketeering.
[13:05.000 --> 13:12.000]  But because they're big tech and because everybody's laid down to them so long, it's thought that
[13:12.000 --> 13:16.000]  it's a precedent that you just have to kiss their ass and lay down to them and let them do whatever
[13:16.000 --> 13:17.000]  they want forever.
[13:17.000 --> 13:21.000]  And they're just going to keep pushing and pushing and pushing until they completely take over
[13:21.000 --> 13:25.000]  or return the time.
[13:25.000 --> 13:29.000]  But Trump is being lied to and bamboozled by big tech that he has dinner with.
[13:29.000 --> 13:34.000]  They lied to his face and it's a load of crap.
[13:34.000 --> 13:37.000]  Tim Cook is not Donald Trump's friend.
[13:37.000 --> 13:39.000]  My God, the man runs the worst slave factories in China.
[13:39.000 --> 13:42.000]  I'm going to stop there and tell you what's coming up.
[13:42.000 --> 13:44.000]  It's confirmed.
[13:44.000 --> 13:45.000]  No one's reporting this.
[13:45.000 --> 13:49.000]  We're going to break it at the bottom of the hour.
[13:49.000 --> 13:59.000]  The coronavirus, it was patented certified for and authorizes a vaccine 30, four days ago.
[13:59.000 --> 14:01.000]  And magically that's right after that happens.
[14:01.000 --> 14:05.000]  There's an outbreak, not saying anything's going on here.
[14:05.000 --> 14:09.000]  I'm just saying two plus two, sometimes equals four, just sometimes.
[14:09.000 --> 14:16.000]  And ducks quack and fish live in the water and birds fly on the sky and bats hang upside down and
[14:16.000 --> 14:20.000]  bananas are yellow.
[14:20.000 --> 14:24.000]  But then it got, there's another one got patented actually last month.
[14:24.000 --> 14:27.000]  So this is very, very serious situation.
[14:27.000 --> 14:33.000]  We're playing it all out and breaking it all down here today.
[14:33.000 --> 14:38.000]  Please remember that without you, this dog doesn't hunt with your help and support it does.
[14:38.000 --> 14:40.000]  And right now we need financial support.
[14:40.000 --> 14:43.000]  Plus we have products you really need regardless.
[14:43.000 --> 14:46.000]  And so fish oil came back in.
[14:46.000 --> 14:47.000]  It's ultimate fish oil.
[14:47.000 --> 14:54.000]  It's the cleanest, best salmon with a high quality anchovy and with the best krill oil all in one.
[14:54.000 --> 14:57.000]  And it is the very best formula you can find and it doesn't have any mercury in it.
[14:57.000 --> 15:00.000]  It goes through the expensive process of naturally removing that without damaging the oil.
[15:00.000 --> 15:06.000]  And it's going to sell out, but I'm going to still keep it at 33% off for another week or so.
[15:06.000 --> 15:09.000]  And then we'll put it back to full price because it'll be a few more months until it comes back in.
[15:09.000 --> 15:14.000]  So we'll take advantage of the ultimate fish oil and try that out for your heart, your body, your mind.
[15:14.000 --> 15:16.000]  I sleep better on it.
[15:16.000 --> 15:17.000]  How about a new tropic?
[15:17.000 --> 15:23.000]  It just makes everything when you take it with X2, X3, things like turbo force, brain force, it just makes it better.
[15:23.000 --> 15:27.000]  And ultimate fish oil, ladies and gentlemen, is something I take in the morning and in the evening.
[15:27.000 --> 15:28.000]  It's really made my life so great.
[15:28.000 --> 15:30.000]  It makes my children's life amazing.
[15:30.000 --> 15:34.000]  That special, again, will end by Sunday or so.
[15:34.000 --> 15:35.000]  It has to.
[15:35.000 --> 15:37.000]  And then it's going to go back to regular price.
[15:37.000 --> 15:42.000]  And X2 is back in stock.
[15:42.000 --> 15:46.000]  X2 is back in stock, the good halogen, the best iodine you're going to find out there.
[15:46.000 --> 15:51.000]  It's back in stock and 40% off with free shipping right now.
[15:51.000 --> 15:55.000]  Please change your life, change the world, get products and fund the M4.
[15:55.000 --> 16:24.000]  You are critical.
[16:26.000 --> 16:31.000]  I'm here with Scott Yousseam, founder of OMG Tax.
[16:31.000 --> 16:36.000]  Tell us how your company helps our listeners out there who have a problem with the IRS.
[16:36.000 --> 16:41.000]  My team of lawyers, enrolled agents, and licensed tax experts remove wage garnishments.
[16:41.000 --> 16:46.000]  Sometimes in the same day, we even have reduced the total debt some of our clients were required to pay
[16:46.000 --> 16:48.000]  through what is known as an offer in compromise.
[16:48.000 --> 16:50.000]  Can you give us an example of somebody you help?
[16:50.000 --> 16:52.000]  Oh, can I ever?
[16:52.000 --> 16:57.000]  We have taken a $500,000 liability with the IRS.
[16:57.000 --> 16:58.000]  Guess what?
[16:58.000 --> 17:03.000]  The client didn't pay a dime through the representation known as non-collectible status with the government.
[17:03.000 --> 17:09.000]  If you owe the IRS more than $10,000 and you want to see if it's possible to pay a lot less,
[17:09.000 --> 17:13.000]  call OMG Tax right now for a free tax-saving consultation.
[17:13.000 --> 17:23.000]  Call 800-486-8112-800-486-8112-800-486-8112.
[17:23.000 --> 17:27.000]  That's 800-486-8112.

[18:43.000 --> 18:48.000]  But you need these products. That's the real reason you want to get them is because they're amazing.
[18:48.000 --> 18:52.000]  And then when you get great results, please tell others about it word of mouth.
[18:52.000 --> 18:56.000]  That's how we expand in the face of the NWO instead of imploding.
[18:56.000 --> 19:24.000]  We're fighting to win and we are winning. Thanks to you.
[19:24.000 --> 19:33.000]  Up until about eight, nine years ago when I started taking X2 and the products in forest life, I still got sick every couple of years.
[19:33.000 --> 19:37.000]  And you know, I still get sore throats from allergies and pollen and things like that.
[19:37.000 --> 19:48.000]  But now that I religiously take the products and in forest life with the highest quality supplements you're going to find out there, I just never get a fever anymore.
[19:48.000 --> 19:55.000]  It's probably been three, four years since I've had a fever. It's just crazy.
[19:55.000 --> 20:20.000]  So I chalk it up to genetics and the great products.
[20:20.000 --> 20:42.000]  It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the info war.
[20:42.000 --> 20:45.000]  Here is how the committee will proceed for this hearing.
[20:45.000 --> 20:51.000]  I will make an opening statement and then I will recognize the ranking member for an opening statement.
[20:51.000 --> 20:54.000]  After that, we will hear two sets of presentations.
[20:54.000 --> 21:01.000]  Jerry Maddler and the Democrat Party are committing treason against this country.
[21:01.000 --> 21:16.000]  So I am heading to court right now for my unlawful disruption of Congress when Jerry Maddler was leading the scam hoax impeachment trial against President Trump in the house.
[21:16.000 --> 21:22.000]  Now, this was something I couldn't help but doing when I was in that room, just seeing Jerry and Adler lie to me was enough to get me to stand up and say something.
[21:22.000 --> 21:24.000]  But we'll see what happens today.
[21:24.000 --> 21:26.000]  We know how corrupt the DC court is.
[21:26.000 --> 21:27.000]  We know how partisan it is.
[21:27.000 --> 21:29.000]  We know how one sided it is.
[21:29.000 --> 21:30.000]  We know the treatment around her stone.
[21:30.000 --> 21:32.000]  We've seen what they've done to Flynn.
[21:32.000 --> 22:00.000]  So let's see if even for lower level petty things like unlawful disruption of Congress, which I can test, we'll see if they're even partisan on that.
[22:00.000 --> 22:07.000]  Jerry Maddler and the Democrat Party are committing treason against this country.
[22:07.000 --> 22:10.000]  And you can kick me out, but he's the one committing crimes.
[22:10.000 --> 22:11.000]  You are, Jerry Maddler.
[22:11.000 --> 22:13.000]  You're the one committing treason.
[22:13.000 --> 22:15.000]  America's done the thing.
[22:15.000 --> 22:18.000]  America's taken the treason committed by the Democrat Party.
[22:18.000 --> 22:31.000]  We're not going to sit here and watch you run in the streets and remove our oath.
[22:31.000 --> 22:34.000]  We voted for Donald Trump and there's people who are moving because they don't like him.
[22:34.000 --> 22:35.000]  America's committed treason.
[22:35.000 --> 22:37.000]  We know who committed the crime and it wasn't Trump.
[22:37.000 --> 22:46.000]  Trump is innocent.
[22:46.000 --> 22:49.000]  This is Savannah Hernandez for Action 7 News.
[22:49.000 --> 22:53.000]  I am currently here in Washington, D.C. where Owen Shroyer just entered.
[22:53.000 --> 22:56.000]  Now he's here for his court date after the disruption of Congress.
[22:56.000 --> 23:00.000]  We know that this is something that many liberal people have gotten away with.
[23:00.000 --> 23:04.000]  Yet here is Owen Shroyer having to come to court for this disruption.
[23:04.000 --> 23:10.000]  We'll be giving you live updates and exclusive coverage of this all day.
[23:10.000 --> 23:16.000]  We've got both Savannah Hernandez and Owen joining us coming up in the second hour here
[23:16.000 --> 23:22.000]  today and again live reports from D.C. with the second day of the Trump trial.
[23:22.000 --> 23:28.000]  But all it is is the Democrats grandstanding and again telling us over and over again how
[23:28.000 --> 23:34.000]  guilty Trump is trying to game the system just like they gamed the House Intelligence
[23:34.000 --> 23:39.000]  Committee manufacturing these charges that are baseless and are nebulous.
[23:39.000 --> 23:42.000]  Now they're trying to game the Senate, but that's not happening.
[23:42.000 --> 23:48.000]  And the trial should be over by, if not next Friday, next Monday is what I'm predicting.
[23:48.000 --> 23:52.000]  Unless they go over the weekend, it can be done by next Thursday.
[23:52.000 --> 23:54.000]  But we will be here covering it.
[23:54.000 --> 23:57.000]  And then once it gets into the Republican case, that's what we haven't seen yet.
[23:57.000 --> 24:02.000]  The Democrats haven't allowed the Republican case in the House where you would normally get it
[24:02.000 --> 24:05.000]  when they were deciding whether or not they would go for the indictment.
[24:05.000 --> 24:08.000]  You would see both sides, but we only saw one side.
[24:08.000 --> 24:12.000]  So three quarters of the time, the Democrats have made sure it's theirs.
[24:12.000 --> 24:16.000]  But there at the end, the Republicans will have two days to put on their defense.
[24:16.000 --> 24:19.000]  And then the senators will have a couple days.
[24:19.000 --> 24:23.000]  McConnell says to ask questions and then they should start deliberation.
[24:23.000 --> 24:26.000]  So that looks to me like next Friday.
[24:26.000 --> 24:28.000]  That's what most folks are saying as well.
[24:28.000 --> 24:30.000]  We'll be here covering it live.
[24:30.000 --> 24:33.000]  And Owen and Savannah are going to come back this weekend to Austin, Texas.
[24:33.000 --> 24:37.000]  They're going to go back next week to D.C. with Rob Do and the rest of the crew up there in D.C.
[24:37.000 --> 24:46.000]  Gateway Pundit, Breitbart, a whole bunch of publications pointed out what a great job Owen Schreuer has been doing,
[24:46.000 --> 24:52.000]  especially just going around illustrating how the leftist renamob individuals are astroturf
[24:52.000 --> 25:03.000]  and how they don't know even why they're there or what they are talking about.
[25:03.000 --> 25:09.000]  So we're going to go to that and then come back and get into the latest on this virus that was recently patented
[25:09.000 --> 25:11.000]  for a vaccine that now magically is hitting everybody.
[25:11.000 --> 25:17.000]  But here is Owen the cock destroyer in D.C. This just came out yesterday.
[25:17.000 --> 25:21.000]  We have just entered Capitol Hill here.
[25:21.000 --> 25:25.000]  And we're trying to figure out what kind of stuff we can do around here right now.
[25:25.000 --> 25:27.000]  Obviously there's very strict rules.
[25:27.000 --> 25:34.000]  And in fact, Mitch McConnell has made it even harder for media to get any access to the Senate floor today
[25:34.000 --> 25:36.000]  as the impeachment trial is ongoing.
[25:36.000 --> 25:39.000]  So we walk in and we're like, what are we going to do?
[25:39.000 --> 25:44.000]  And oh, we find these guys, the impeach Trump group.
[25:44.000 --> 25:48.000]  So let's go find out if they have any idea why Trump should be impeached.
[25:48.000 --> 25:51.000]  And I'll go ahead and school them on the issues.
[25:51.000 --> 25:54.000]  So can you guys tell me why Trump should be impeached?
[25:54.000 --> 25:59.000]  Is that because you don't know the reason?
[25:59.000 --> 26:02.000]  You don't know the reason, do you?
[26:02.000 --> 26:05.000]  So I'm going to dominate them.
[26:05.000 --> 26:09.000]  So here's the truth about Trump's impeachment.
[26:09.000 --> 26:13.000]  They're claiming that Trump's impeachment is for Ukrainian quid pro quo.
[26:13.000 --> 26:19.000]  The only problem is Nancy Pelosi, who advanced the articles of impeachment to the Senate,
[26:19.000 --> 26:25.000]  admitted that they started this inquiry before Trump was even president.
[26:25.000 --> 26:29.000]  So how can they impeach Trump for something he did as president?
[26:29.000 --> 26:30.000]  You're in the way.
[26:30.000 --> 26:31.000]  You're in the way.
[26:31.000 --> 26:33.000]  So can you not touch my cameraman, please?
[26:33.000 --> 26:34.000]  Here we go.
[26:34.000 --> 26:35.000]  Here we go.
[26:35.000 --> 26:36.000]  Yeah, let's get them going.
[26:36.000 --> 26:38.000]  So here's the five minutes of hate.
[26:38.000 --> 26:46.000]  They'll deny the reality that Nancy Pelosi admitted that they started the impeachment process before Trump became president.
[26:46.000 --> 26:52.000]  So what is Trump being impeached for?
[26:52.000 --> 26:53.000]  Sir, I will talk to you.
[26:53.000 --> 26:54.000]  I'll explain the truth.
[26:54.000 --> 26:59.000]  Trump is being impeached for what?
[26:59.000 --> 27:00.000]  No, no, what?
[27:00.000 --> 27:01.000]  What are they bringing forward?
[27:01.000 --> 27:02.000]  Why?
[27:02.000 --> 27:03.000]  Why?
[27:03.000 --> 27:05.000]  What was it?
[27:05.000 --> 27:07.000]  Can anybody tell me why Trump was impeached?
[27:07.000 --> 27:10.000]  Can anybody tell me why Trump was impeached?
[27:10.000 --> 27:12.000]  None of you can.
[27:12.000 --> 27:13.000]  Because you...
[27:13.000 --> 27:14.000]  No, that's not true.
[27:14.000 --> 27:15.000]  It was Ukraine.
[27:15.000 --> 27:17.000]  It was the phone call with Ukraine.
[27:17.000 --> 27:19.000]  So they don't even know why.
[27:19.000 --> 27:21.000]  They don't even know why Trump was impeached.
[27:21.000 --> 27:24.000]  It was the phone call with Ukraine.
[27:24.000 --> 27:32.000]  And by the way, Nancy Pelosi admitted they started the impeachment process before the phone call ever happened.
[27:32.000 --> 27:33.000]  So they were...
[27:33.000 --> 27:35.000]  No, sir, explain to me what he's being impeached for.
[27:35.000 --> 27:38.000]  She did not start it before...
[27:38.000 --> 27:41.000]  No, she said that on a national televised interview.
[27:41.000 --> 27:42.000]  I didn't hear that.
[27:42.000 --> 27:44.000]  Okay, well maybe you should look into it.
[27:44.000 --> 27:46.000]  You should, but why should Trump be impeached?
[27:46.000 --> 27:47.000]  What did he do?
[27:47.000 --> 27:48.000]  You're out here protesting.
[27:48.000 --> 27:50.000]  Yeah, this guy again.
[27:50.000 --> 27:51.000]  So there you go.
[27:51.000 --> 27:55.000]  Another impeached Trump crowd that can't say why Trump should be impeached.
[27:55.000 --> 27:58.000]  You can go to every impeached Trump rally in this country,
[27:58.000 --> 28:01.000]  and not one of them can say why Trump should be impeached.
[28:01.000 --> 28:02.000]  Not one of them.
[28:02.000 --> 28:04.000]  And if they were real activists,
[28:04.000 --> 28:06.000]  that had any truth,
[28:06.000 --> 28:07.000]  that had any truth to their movement,
[28:07.000 --> 28:08.000]  they can answer a single question.
[28:08.000 --> 28:10.000]  You guys are all frauds.
[28:10.000 --> 28:12.000]  You all have been deceived.
[28:12.000 --> 28:13.000]  Sir, I can explain things.
[28:13.000 --> 28:15.000]  I know how to explain things.
[28:15.000 --> 28:16.000]  I've heard it.
[28:16.000 --> 28:17.000]  I know how to explain things.
[28:17.000 --> 28:18.000]  How is that, man?
[28:18.000 --> 28:20.000]  But why is he impeached?
[28:20.000 --> 28:21.000]  Why is he impeached, though?
[28:21.000 --> 28:22.000]  So they can't answer.
[28:22.000 --> 28:25.000]  None of them can answer.
[28:25.000 --> 28:29.000]  None of them can answer.
[28:29.000 --> 28:32.000]  You're not allowed to talk to the mentally defective here.
[28:32.000 --> 28:37.000]  You're not allowed to speak to the mentally ill.
[28:37.000 --> 28:39.000]  Smallest victory.
[28:39.000 --> 28:44.000]  It's very, very sad how brainwashed and brain damaged these people are.
[28:44.000 --> 28:45.000]  They're followers.
[28:45.000 --> 28:46.000]  They're empty.
[28:46.000 --> 28:49.000]  They look like they've had their souls sucked out.
[28:49.000 --> 28:50.000]  And that's very, very sad.
[28:50.000 --> 28:53.000]  But that's who falls, the globalist garbage.
[28:53.000 --> 29:21.000]  I'm going to break down the coronavirus when we return.
[29:21.000 --> 29:23.000]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[29:23.000 --> 29:25.000]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[29:25.000 --> 29:28.000]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look.
[29:28.000 --> 29:30.000]  And I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[29:30.000 --> 29:32.000]  I recommend heart and body extract to everyone.
[29:32.000 --> 29:37.000]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative
[29:37.000 --> 29:40.000]  to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.

[29:59.000 --> 30:02.000]  Infowars life is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine.
[30:02.000 --> 30:04.000]  Introducing pollen block.
[30:04.000 --> 30:10.000]  We have found an extraordinary new, natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms, including
[30:10.000 --> 30:16.000]  promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort, and respiratory function.
[30:16.000 --> 30:21.000]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs
[30:21.000 --> 30:25.000]  experienced less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses.
[30:25.000 --> 30:28.000]  They began studying this effect in published trials.
[30:28.000 --> 30:31.000]  And decades later, we now have the fruit of this research,
[30:31.000 --> 30:36.000]  a fast-acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms.
[30:36.000 --> 30:39.000]  Pollen block is natural and effective.
[30:39.000 --> 30:41.000]  It is not an antihistamine.
[30:41.000 --> 30:46.000]  In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of tryptase,
[30:46.000 --> 30:51.000]  which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.
[30:51.000 --> 30:53.000]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe.
[30:53.000 --> 30:59.000]  Head to infowarslife.com and grab a pack of our pollen block, chewable tablets.
[30:59.000 --> 31:04.000]  This is a call for modern-day Paul Revere's, who are all Americans,
[31:04.000 --> 31:09.000]  who are all human beings who bleed red blood, love God, and love justice,
[31:09.000 --> 31:12.000]  and who have awakened to the New World Order threat.
[31:12.000 --> 31:17.000]  You are the modern Paul Revere's, and without you, no one knows about Bandod video.
[31:17.000 --> 31:21.000]  And our live coverage of the attempt to remove the president in the Senate trial
[31:21.000 --> 31:26.000]  and the deep state trying to trigger a civil emergency in Virginia.
[31:26.000 --> 31:30.000]  We've got our teams on the ground. We'll be covering all of it.
[31:30.000 --> 31:34.000]  But the only way we're able to put the truth out is you magnifying it
[31:34.000 --> 31:40.000]  by sharing the links from Bandod video and newswars.com forward slash show.
[31:40.000 --> 31:43.000]  Newswars.com forward slash show and Bandod video.
[31:43.000 --> 31:48.000]  We have a whole live Trump trial and Virginia coverage page.
[31:48.000 --> 31:51.000]  And as the latest live feeds go up, where's the latest reports go up?
[31:51.000 --> 31:54.000]  They're posted right there at Bandod video.
[31:54.000 --> 31:56.000]  So click that link and share it.
[31:56.000 --> 31:59.000]  It's a revolutionary act, and it's powerful.
[31:59.000 --> 32:03.000]  It's time to take a new healthier approach to one of your most basic needs.
[32:03.000 --> 32:06.000]  The Alexa Pure Pro water filtration system is the same water filter
[32:06.000 --> 32:10.000]  that Alex and the InfoWars crew use every day for the purest water possible.
[32:10.000 --> 32:14.000]  You can start cleaning the toxins from your water for clean, healthy, and delicious drinking water.
[32:14.000 --> 32:17.000]  Perfect for preppers or anyone concerned with a healthier source of water,
[32:17.000 --> 32:21.000]  the Alexa Pure Pro can remove up to 99.9% of impurities.
[32:21.000 --> 32:25.000]  With ground breaking, gravity-fed water filtration system is like no other.
[32:25.000 --> 32:54.000]  Make sure your water is up to your standards today with the Alexa Pure Pro.
[32:55.000 --> 33:01.000]  Welcome to the Fight InfoWars. Brought to you by you.
[33:01.000 --> 33:27.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[33:27.000 --> 33:34.000]  So does he. Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[33:34.000 --> 33:44.000]  You know when InfoWars tells you something's bombshell news, we're not hyping it.
[33:44.000 --> 33:49.000]  There's a lot of bombshells, though. This is a war for the future of humanity on this planet and beyond.
[33:49.000 --> 33:54.000]  Infinity and beyond is bustling light-year likes to say.
[33:54.000 --> 34:01.000]  But I just got a call, or the producer did, Daria, two minutes ago saying,
[34:01.000 --> 34:04.000]  oh, and just got out of court, it's bombshell news.
[34:04.000 --> 34:09.000]  They're trying to put him in jail for going in there at the kickoff of impeachment
[34:09.000 --> 34:14.000]  and saying who needs to really be impeached is the Democrats and the deep state.
[34:14.000 --> 34:19.000]  Now, we can't find cases where the Democrats, other than the fact that they got physical sometimes,
[34:19.000 --> 34:23.000]  sometimes they've gotten physical, they've actually been indicted.
[34:23.000 --> 34:27.000]  But when the Democrats take over at live events, they don't get in trouble.
[34:27.000 --> 34:31.000]  They might get arrested, but they're throwing the book at Owen Shroyer.
[34:31.000 --> 34:34.000]  So we'll find out what the big news is.
[34:34.000 --> 34:39.000]  He just got out of court coming up in about 10 minutes when we go to break,
[34:39.000 --> 34:41.000]  and then we'll come back in about 12 minutes.
[34:41.000 --> 34:43.000]  We will know exactly what's going on on that front.
[34:43.000 --> 34:46.000]  Okay.
[34:46.000 --> 34:49.000]  This is a subject that I'm going to kick off right now,
[34:49.000 --> 34:54.000]  but then I want to open the phones up in the second third and into the fourth hour today
[34:54.000 --> 35:00.000]  because it's a big deal.
[35:00.000 --> 35:05.000]  These coronaviruses, or what they used to call bird flu,
[35:05.000 --> 35:10.000]  are really dangerous, obviously, because there's a lot of mutations of them,
[35:10.000 --> 35:16.000]  and they keep coming out of Asia where pigs and ducks and chickens
[35:16.000 --> 35:22.000]  are kept in close proximity, and so you get the different sewage
[35:22.000 --> 35:26.000]  running together into these slurry pines, and that's where they believe
[35:26.000 --> 35:31.000]  they hypothesized, and now they've proven that a lot of these mutations happen
[35:31.000 --> 35:36.000]  because pigs are closer to humans, and that somehow then there's a transmutation
[35:36.000 --> 35:41.000]  and it's able to cross over into a virus that humans can get.
[35:41.000 --> 35:46.000]  And when you get a new zoological virus, a lot of times it tends to be extremely deadly,
[35:46.000 --> 35:49.000]  so they've been working on a bunch of vaccines for these,
[35:49.000 --> 35:56.000]  and there is a Piperite Institute about pronouncing that right.
[35:56.000 --> 36:00.000]  That's the shadowy secretive group, like a lot of these big foundations,
[36:00.000 --> 36:02.000]  where they get their money.
[36:02.000 --> 36:04.000]  I would guess a lot of it's probably the Loma Linda Gates,
[36:04.000 --> 36:14.000]  but they've been working on trying to create a vaccine for this,
[36:14.000 --> 36:29.000]  and so they've patented over the years different mutations of the virus.
[36:29.000 --> 36:34.000]  And so I just find it very, very interesting that magically there's a vaccine for this now,
[36:34.000 --> 36:38.000]  and well, there you go, for this coronavirus.
[36:38.000 --> 36:43.000]  And here are some of the reports coming out.
[36:43.000 --> 36:51.000]  Coronavirus death toll doubles as 17 as more than 470 cases of mutating bug confirmed.
[36:51.000 --> 36:53.000]  That's the sun.
[36:53.000 --> 37:00.000]  The state of panic hits the globe as cases of China's new mystery virus rise exponentially.
[37:00.000 --> 37:08.000]  First U.S. case of Wuhan, coronavirus confirmed by the Centers for Disease Control in Washington state.
[37:08.000 --> 37:16.000]  Experts estimate at least 4,000 people infected with coronavirus in cases could reach the U.K.,
[37:16.000 --> 37:20.000]  at least 500 ill, and you know it's probably a lot more than that.
[37:20.000 --> 37:27.000]  I know there was a virus similar to this that killed my uncle and a bunch of other people in East Texas.
[37:27.000 --> 37:38.000]  This was six years ago, and folks could not believe how deadly it was.
[37:38.000 --> 37:41.000]  And I talked to Drs. Nurses and they said, well, we're not creating a panic,
[37:41.000 --> 37:49.000]  but yeah, there's a cover up on just how deadly this is and how high the mortality rate is
[37:49.000 --> 37:52.000]  and how infectious it is.
[37:52.000 --> 37:59.000]  Killer coronavirus attacks the body with pneumonia symptoms to look out for.
[37:59.000 --> 38:04.000]  And now, of course, they've got heat scanners at the airport seeing we've got a fever
[38:04.000 --> 38:06.000]  and they're supposedly checking you for it.
[38:06.000 --> 38:10.000]  You know what's wrong with this whole picture?
[38:10.000 --> 38:14.000]  They're telling us on the menu at China's virus market, Yahoo News,
[38:14.000 --> 38:19.000]  French news agency, Rats and Live Wolf Pops, now that's top of stuff to eat there,
[38:19.000 --> 38:23.000]  imported from around the world.
[38:23.000 --> 38:26.000]  And yes, you can get diseases from eating weird foods like that,
[38:26.000 --> 38:30.000]  but it's the genetic engineering, it's the vaccines mixing,
[38:30.000 --> 38:33.000]  how many times have vaccines caused pandemics and they've admitted it.
[38:33.000 --> 38:36.000]  The old days they just admitted it, but now they just cover it up.
[38:36.000 --> 38:40.000]  So pointing at that market is a big distraction.
[38:40.000 --> 38:44.000]  The virus grows, China virus toll rises.
[38:44.000 --> 38:47.000]  But what's really going on here?
[38:47.000 --> 38:52.000]  Well, tens of thousands have now died from Ebola in the last few rounds,
[38:52.000 --> 38:55.000]  the biggest outbreaks ever in the Congo,
[38:55.000 --> 39:00.000]  and then there's a program with George Soros and the UN publicly flying them
[39:00.000 --> 39:07.000]  out of the Congo into Mexico and then Mexico lets them come through
[39:07.000 --> 39:11.000]  and then there's groups picking them up, loading them on vans in Austin,
[39:11.000 --> 39:17.000]  San Antonio and other areas and taking them all over the United States
[39:17.000 --> 39:21.000]  when the Ebola is much more deadly than this.
[39:21.000 --> 39:23.000]  And we know there's been cases in the US that have been covered up
[39:23.000 --> 39:27.000]  and cases in the Caribbean, that's been confirmed.
[39:27.000 --> 39:33.000]  So why in the hell would the deep state want thousands of Congonese
[39:33.000 --> 39:36.000]  coming in a week that we know of still ongoing?
[39:36.000 --> 39:39.000]  We've gone out and caught it ourselves.
[39:39.000 --> 39:42.000]  People being snuck out of dormitories at night, loaded on the buses.
[39:42.000 --> 39:49.000]  Our reporter, Gregory's, physically assaulted.
[39:49.000 --> 39:52.000]  But if you try to sneak across the borders of citizens, you get in trouble
[39:52.000 --> 39:55.000]  and you should because if you don't have a border, we don't have a nation.
[39:55.000 --> 39:59.000]  Bernie Sanders says get rid of our borders even existing.
[39:59.000 --> 40:01.000]  So I know this.
[40:01.000 --> 40:07.000]  SV 40, the year before the big outbreak was at 10, 11, 13 years ago, time flies,
[40:07.000 --> 40:14.000]  was an admitted simulant that the CDC authorized to be put in the previous year's flu vaccine
[40:14.000 --> 40:20.000]  as a live flu virus that they had genetically engineered, they said to be not harmful
[40:20.000 --> 40:28.000]  to track the spread of flu and the mutation to try to guess the mutation the next year.
[40:28.000 --> 40:37.000]  And then we had a really bad outbreak that particular year in your member of the flu.
[40:37.000 --> 40:39.000]  And I had medical doctors and virologists on.
[40:39.000 --> 40:40.000]  I'm not an expert.
[40:40.000 --> 40:42.000]  They are saying this is engineered.
[40:42.000 --> 40:43.000]  This was released.
[40:43.000 --> 40:47.000]  And that's the thing about the UN admitted in those shock admissions by their top
[40:47.000 --> 40:51.000]  scientists that we've been covering happened last December.
[40:51.000 --> 40:54.000]  Second and third got no coverage till we broke it down here.
[40:54.000 --> 40:57.000]  Frighteningly enough, it'd been out for weeks on their website.
[40:57.000 --> 41:03.000]  And they say, we don't even have studies on the adjuvants.
[41:03.000 --> 41:05.000]  Now they're mixing much less.
[41:05.000 --> 41:10.000]  The mutagenic effects of these live viruses that they engineer and they just say, oh,
[41:10.000 --> 41:13.000]  it's safe, but it mutates and it sheds.
[41:13.000 --> 41:19.000]  You know, sheds like when you somebody's got herpes and it sheds when you have sex with
[41:19.000 --> 41:23.000]  somebody and they get it or Ebola sheds or the flu sheds.
[41:23.000 --> 41:28.000]  That means it goes in to cells.
[41:28.000 --> 41:30.000]  It replicates.
[41:30.000 --> 41:31.000]  It takes some over.
[41:31.000 --> 41:33.000]  They just go, but it's not a problem.
[41:33.000 --> 41:35.000]  It doesn't take over too many and make you sick.
[41:35.000 --> 41:40.000]  And then those cells explode and millions more spread and they.
[41:40.000 --> 41:41.000]  They say, oh, don't worry.
[41:41.000 --> 41:43.000]  These new ones vaccinate everyone.
[41:43.000 --> 41:46.000]  See, that's the big sick joke is, oh, you're not going to take the vaccines.
[41:46.000 --> 41:49.000]  Yes, you are.
[41:49.000 --> 41:55.000]  And you see how that's hiding in plain view.
[41:55.000 --> 41:57.000]  Ladies and gentlemen.
[41:57.000 --> 41:59.000]  And that's when they were hiding the folks.
[41:59.000 --> 42:02.000]  We had to hide out there at night and then catch them being snuck out at night.
[42:02.000 --> 42:06.000]  If you fast forward on this tape, this is just shocking stuff we're doing.
[42:06.000 --> 42:11.000]  And that's why they want us off the air because right side broadcasting and judicial watch
[42:11.000 --> 42:15.000]  are carrying feeds that they paid for off the government and C span fees.
[42:15.000 --> 42:19.000]  You can buy it from the government or C span or in a partnership with Congress.
[42:19.000 --> 42:21.000]  It's very inexpensive.
[42:21.000 --> 42:22.000]  A couple hundred bucks.
[42:22.000 --> 42:24.000]  Last time we did it to pay for a feed.
[42:24.000 --> 42:28.000]  Now we just have the satellite feeds here and subscribe to them, but.
[42:28.000 --> 42:30.000]  And.
[42:30.000 --> 42:32.000]  Jack Dorsey is an Oliver Darcy.
[42:32.000 --> 42:34.000]  Oliver Darcy calls up and says, that's his job.
[42:34.000 --> 42:39.000]  It says that you've got an extremist carrying all YouTube blocked it.
[42:39.000 --> 42:41.000]  That that's in the news right here.
[42:41.000 --> 42:42.000]  So that's the level.
[42:42.000 --> 42:43.000]  They don't want us on air.
[42:43.000 --> 42:45.000]  They don't want us being able to cover any of this.
[42:45.000 --> 42:46.000]  They are the masters.
[42:46.000 --> 42:48.000]  They are the controllers.
[42:48.000 --> 42:50.000]  They're the ones that are going to suppress the American people, but they're not.
[42:50.000 --> 42:53.000]  Because we have band.video and you're sharing it.
[42:53.000 --> 42:57.000]  We have our own transmission system, but only you can amplify it.
[42:57.000 --> 43:04.000]  It is I, the leader of Cobra here for a message to President Trump, the American people,
[43:04.000 --> 43:07.000]  and Alex Jones of Info Wars.
[43:07.000 --> 43:14.000]  Our operation for our partners, the Communist Chinese have bought control of your media,
[43:14.000 --> 43:19.000]  but it's true, your people are beginning to awaken.
[43:19.000 --> 43:26.000]  That's why Cobra is launching operations to trigger race war, mass shootings and bombings,
[43:26.000 --> 43:30.000]  which will be blamed on those loyal to America.
[43:30.000 --> 43:35.000]  Anyone once we stage these attacks, that does not blame it on Trump,
[43:35.000 --> 43:39.000]  we'll also be targeted by Cobra in the future.
[43:39.000 --> 43:45.000]  You see, when you expose our false flags and fake media,
[43:45.000 --> 43:51.000]  I will carry out attacks and then blame you like we've done with Alex Jones,
[43:51.000 --> 43:55.000]  blaming him for mass shootings we committed.
[43:55.000 --> 44:05.000]  Allergies, dander, asthma, germs, toxins.
[44:05.000 --> 44:09.000]  There are many reasons why we need to think about what is really in the air around us.
[44:09.000 --> 44:13.000]  We may not be able to stop breathing, but we can control what's in the air we breathe.
[44:13.000 --> 44:18.000]  The revolutionary Alexa Pure Breeze air filtration system is a powerful ally
[44:18.000 --> 44:22.000]  in the fight against the dangerous toxins and viruses in the air.
[44:22.000 --> 44:27.000]  If you're quiet and effective, the breeze uses a four-step purification process
[44:27.000 --> 44:29.000]  to help you breathe easier and cleaner.
[44:29.000 --> 44:33.000]  Similar systems could cost hundreds to even thousands of dollars,
[44:33.000 --> 44:38.000]  but the Alexa Pure Breeze air purification is the best and most affordable bar none.
[44:38.000 --> 44:42.000]  The breeze in the ion cluster patented technology used in the system
[44:42.000 --> 44:46.000]  eliminate up to 99.97% of airborne contaminants.
[44:46.000 --> 44:51.000]  Get the Alexa Pure Breeze today and save big on a world-class air filtration system for your home.

[45:23.000 --> 45:25.000]  Most of it's powerful, it's incredible.
[45:25.000 --> 45:28.000]  But there's major obstacles coming down the road
[45:28.000 --> 45:32.000]  and the only way we can effectively fight the NWO and stay in the game
[45:32.000 --> 45:35.000]  like Infowars is to the tip of the spear is your financial support.
[45:35.000 --> 45:38.000]  We make it really easy at InfowarsStore.com.
[45:38.000 --> 45:42.000]  But I am blowing through our backup money right now
[45:42.000 --> 45:46.000]  with our reporters doing triple the work they ever had because they volunteered to do it.
[45:46.000 --> 45:50.000]  And Owen and the rest of the crew will fight 18 hours a day, 7 days a week
[45:50.000 --> 45:55.000]  during this election year that's so critical but they need the financing to put them in the field.
[45:55.000 --> 46:24.000]  Go to InfowarsStore.com and fight for your own future.
[46:25.000 --> 46:27.000]  We'll have less ads and less plugs.
[46:27.000 --> 46:30.000]  And we'll expand and really give the globalists a run for their money.
[46:30.000 --> 46:34.000]  But we've got products you already really need like DNA Force Plus, X2.
[46:34.000 --> 46:36.000]  These will change your life.
[46:36.000 --> 46:39.000]  Go check out the turmeric products, check out the water filtration, air filtration.
[46:39.000 --> 46:40.000]  Check it all out.
[46:40.000 --> 46:43.000]  Whatever you do, take action and know be part of the Second American Revolution.
[46:43.000 --> 46:46.000]  Be part of Crush the Globalist and get great products at the same time.
[46:46.000 --> 46:49.000]  InfowarsStore.com is the umbrella site.
[46:49.000 --> 46:51.000]  InfowarsLive.com is the supplements.
[46:51.000 --> 47:01.000]  Take action now and fund the Infowar for your own future.
[47:01.000 --> 47:14.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[47:14.000 --> 47:16.000]  I don't want to interrupt but I'm leaving.
[47:16.000 --> 47:18.000]  You've been doing great Owen.
[47:18.000 --> 47:22.000]  We're going to finish up with these calls within Gregory's and of course Harrison Smith.
[47:22.000 --> 47:24.000]  They're going to take another hour calls.
[47:24.000 --> 47:25.000]  Cruz volunteered to do it.
[47:25.000 --> 47:28.000]  So we're here live covering this hoping everything de-escalates.
[47:28.000 --> 47:30.000]  So the live coverage continues.
[47:30.000 --> 47:31.000]  Everybody spread those links.
[47:31.000 --> 47:32.000]  The globalists are hacking us.
[47:32.000 --> 47:33.000]  Trying to shut this down.
[47:33.000 --> 47:34.000]  Don't let them win.
[47:34.000 --> 47:35.000]  No BS.
[47:35.000 --> 47:37.000]  Everything's straight shooting here.
[47:37.000 --> 47:39.000]  See I don't have some Mackie Valley manipulative view.
[47:39.000 --> 47:41.000]  With me it's all straightforward attack.
[47:41.000 --> 47:43.000]  That's the real power.
[47:43.000 --> 47:47.000]  Don't act so surprised globalists.
[47:47.000 --> 47:51.000]  You didn't think you could silence the American people did you.
[47:51.000 --> 47:55.000]  Join band art video and I will complete your training.
[47:55.000 --> 48:05.000]  Together we can overthrow the Emperor and restore the Republic.
[48:05.000 --> 48:10.000]  You have to do every single thing I say or we will not make it.
[48:10.000 --> 48:11.000]  Understand.
[48:11.000 --> 48:12.000]  Do you understand.
[48:12.000 --> 48:14.000]  Come with me if you want to live.
[48:14.000 --> 48:30.000]  Come with me if you want to live.
[48:30.000 --> 48:33.000]  Troyer has been in DC.
[48:33.000 --> 48:34.000]  Dozens of times.
[48:34.000 --> 48:37.000]  He's been on Capitol Hill probably over a hundred times.
[48:37.000 --> 48:39.000]  But as a citizen not as a journalist.
[48:39.000 --> 48:42.000]  He spontaneously as you know last month.
[48:42.000 --> 48:46.000]  Stood up to Jerry Nadler and said it's you that's guilty of treason.
[48:46.000 --> 48:52.000]  It's you that are obstructing the progress of our country with your false kangaroo operations.
[48:52.000 --> 48:57.000]  That was the day they were getting ready to vote and then move the indictment onto the
[48:57.000 --> 49:02.000]  Senate and now you see that ongoing fiasco about the Democrats trying to stall as long
[49:02.000 --> 49:09.000]  as they can and we have Pelosi admitting impeachment began the day Trump was elected.
[49:09.000 --> 49:12.000]  We'll play that clip in a few minutes.
[49:12.000 --> 49:19.000]  Now Owen Troyer is about to fill everybody in on what happened and just cutting to the
[49:19.000 --> 49:20.000]  chase.
[49:20.000 --> 49:22.000]  Then he'll lay it all out.
[49:22.000 --> 49:27.000]  You've all seen what he did politely but focused laid out the facts for like 30 seconds
[49:27.000 --> 49:31.000]  shot her around the world in the information war resonated with everybody because it was
[49:31.000 --> 49:32.000]  the truth.
[49:32.000 --> 49:36.000]  The gallery was empty because you're supposed to have citizens allowed in there but they
[49:36.000 --> 49:43.000]  didn't anybody in but Owen and Drew both have a confident bearing about them.
[49:43.000 --> 49:48.000]  Owen looks like a Calvin Klein model and Drew looks like Phil Castro's grandson and
[49:48.000 --> 49:58.000]  so they just walk right in and then again we're able to observe and Owen felt driven
[49:58.000 --> 50:00.000]  because I told him don't get arrested and don't do stuff like that.
[50:00.000 --> 50:05.000]  You've seen I don't do that because I don't want them to pull a bunch of garbage on us.
[50:05.000 --> 50:06.000]  Democrats do it.
[50:06.000 --> 50:10.000]  They just promise not to do it again and they just ship more Soros people and we've gone
[50:10.000 --> 50:15.000]  and checked almost no one has ever charged almost no one ever gets to court but not Owen.
[50:15.000 --> 50:19.000]  He got in today and they were treating him like he was a already convicted crack dealer
[50:19.000 --> 50:25.000]  who got busted on his fifth homicide charge or he just got caught robbing a liquor store.
[50:25.000 --> 50:27.000]  They're like you're going to jail.
[50:27.000 --> 50:29.000]  You're getting drug tested.
[50:29.000 --> 50:32.000]  You're banned from ever going to Congress signed right here.
[50:32.000 --> 50:37.000]  Owen and his counsel said no and then all of a sudden they get on the phone with Congress
[50:37.000 --> 50:40.000]  and the Democrats and they're telling the judges what to do.
[50:40.000 --> 50:45.000]  So that's how dangerous this is and how they've weaponized the judicial system in many areas
[50:45.000 --> 50:48.000]  the Democrats control against the American people.
[50:48.000 --> 50:50.000]  So Owen Schreuer joins us.
[50:50.000 --> 50:54.000]  He's out in front of the White House right now and that was me bullhorning that letter
[50:54.000 --> 50:57.000]  about Trump being to take action when he was in court this morning.
[50:57.000 --> 50:59.000]  Here's footage of that happening.
[50:59.000 --> 51:02.000]  So Owen thank you for joining us. Amazing job.
[51:02.000 --> 51:06.000]  The great coverage you and Savannah are laying out with Harrison Smith is big national news.
[51:06.000 --> 51:08.000]  Thank God you're there altering the globalist narrative.
[51:08.000 --> 51:10.000]  Fox News isn't doing it.
[51:10.000 --> 51:12.000]  Other folks aren't doing it.
[51:12.000 --> 51:14.000]  So it's so important to keep you in the game my friend.
[51:14.000 --> 51:15.000]  It's listeners to keep you in the game.
[51:15.000 --> 51:18.000]  Tell us succinctly what happened.
[51:18.000 --> 51:20.000]  Well and that's it right there Alex.
[51:20.000 --> 51:23.000]  They want me out of the game just like they want you just like they want info wars out of the game
[51:23.000 --> 51:29.000]  and that's why they were attempting to ban me from capital grounds.
[51:29.000 --> 51:34.000]  Ban me from all congressional offices as you said we rejected that notion
[51:34.000 --> 51:38.000]  and we actually had to be in two different courtrooms today.
[51:38.000 --> 51:42.000]  So when we got into the first courtroom and dealt with the judge there
[51:42.000 --> 51:50.000]  basically what we learned was that the state prosecutors are taking orders from higher ups
[51:50.000 --> 51:54.000]  as you said the most likely directly from the Democrat Party
[51:54.000 --> 51:58.000]  the same Democrat Party that probably pulled the Capitol Police to arrest me that day
[51:58.000 --> 52:01.000]  instead of let me go like they do other people we can get back to that.
[52:01.000 --> 52:04.000]  So back to the court case so they made all these demands.
[52:04.000 --> 52:06.000]  I refuse these demands.
[52:06.000 --> 52:10.000]  They then moved it up to a higher court where we got in front of another judge
[52:10.000 --> 52:14.000]  a different state prosecuting attorney came up and said the same thing.
[52:14.000 --> 52:17.000]  We want Shroyer banned from all Capitol buildings.
[52:17.000 --> 52:19.000]  We want him banned from all congressional offices.
[52:19.000 --> 52:22.000]  Now the judge in this case said absolutely not.
[52:22.000 --> 52:26.000]  That's a violation of the First Amendment but given the current circumstances
[52:26.000 --> 52:28.000]  I will issue a no hats order.
[52:28.000 --> 52:32.000]  So basically I'm allowed to be on the Capitol grounds.
[52:32.000 --> 52:35.000]  I'm allowed to go into chambers but I'm really not allowed to talk
[52:35.000 --> 52:38.000]  and I'm really not allowed to film and I'm not allowed to do my job.
[52:38.000 --> 52:40.000]  Now we'll see how all that develops.
[52:40.000 --> 52:43.000]  I am due back in court next week and we'll see how that goes.
[52:43.000 --> 52:47.000]  But yeah they wanted to ban me from all Capitol buildings all congressional offices.
[52:47.000 --> 52:49.000]  They wanted to drug test me.
[52:49.000 --> 52:52.000]  Why I don't know this has nothing to do with the drug offense
[52:52.000 --> 52:54.000]  but just some procedural procedural things.
[52:54.000 --> 52:56.000]  And by the way you don't even drink.
[52:56.000 --> 52:59.000]  I mean if you're addicted to anything it's exercise.
[52:59.000 --> 53:04.000]  And all the legal minds hearing this are stunned that it went down like this today
[53:04.000 --> 53:05.000]  but this is what it is.
[53:05.000 --> 53:09.000]  We already know about the digital censorship that's happening with
[53:09.000 --> 53:11.000]  with info wars with conservatives and transporters.
[53:11.000 --> 53:12.000]  This is real world censorship.
[53:12.000 --> 53:16.000]  They know that that video of me confronting Nadler is the biggest video
[53:16.000 --> 53:19.000]  perhaps in 2019 going into 2020.
[53:19.000 --> 53:20.000]  They don't want to repeat of that.
[53:20.000 --> 53:24.000]  They also brought up the video that Rob do shot of me yesterday
[53:24.000 --> 53:26.000]  talking to the removed Trump protesters.
[53:26.000 --> 53:30.000]  They brought that up as evidence saying see Shroyer is not allowed on Capitol grounds.
[53:30.000 --> 53:32.000]  Look at how he causes a scene.
[53:32.000 --> 53:33.000]  Causes a scene.
[53:33.000 --> 53:36.000]  There's 30 of them out there you know every day saying get Trump out,
[53:36.000 --> 53:39.000]  remove Trump line but they're allowed to operate.
[53:39.000 --> 53:41.000]  But if Shroyer shows up he's not allowed.
[53:41.000 --> 53:43.000]  Here's another one and there's dozens of these cases.
[53:43.000 --> 53:45.000]  We don't have all the names so we'll use one.
[53:45.000 --> 53:48.000]  Jane Fonda comes out here every week.
[53:48.000 --> 53:51.000]  Does her little disruption of Congress does her little thing gets arrested.
[53:51.000 --> 53:53.000]  Guess what they throw it out.
[53:53.000 --> 53:55.000]  They throw the case out.
[53:55.000 --> 53:57.000]  They don't even have paperwork for Fonda.
[53:57.000 --> 54:01.000]  So there's your celebrity liberal privilege but a little peon citizen
[54:01.000 --> 54:04.000]  who's driven by the truth driven by God's providence.
[54:04.000 --> 54:05.000]  I'm a little peon.
[54:05.000 --> 54:06.000]  I'm not allowed to exist.
[54:06.000 --> 54:11.000]  I'm not allowed to report and based on what the states prosecutors are doing.
[54:11.000 --> 54:13.000]  I'm not I don't even get a free speech.
[54:13.000 --> 54:15.000]  They don't like me. They want to shut me down.
[54:15.000 --> 54:16.000]  I'm not clear.
[54:16.000 --> 54:17.000]  No one was hurt.
[54:17.000 --> 54:18.000]  You didn't resist when you went.
[54:18.000 --> 54:20.000]  The police didn't even think you were going to be arrested.
[54:20.000 --> 54:22.000]  They were letting you go when they got the word.
[54:22.000 --> 54:25.000]  I guess I guess from Nadler to arrest you.
[54:25.000 --> 54:28.000]  And this is the mouse that roars intimidating the lion.
[54:28.000 --> 54:31.000]  But they're not intimidating us and as you said.
[54:31.000 --> 54:34.000]  Right side broadcasting.
[54:34.000 --> 54:37.000]  Even judicial watch.
[54:37.000 --> 54:39.000]  They leased fees which anybody can do.
[54:39.000 --> 54:40.000]  We can do it.
[54:40.000 --> 54:41.000]  Anybody can do it.
[54:41.000 --> 54:42.000]  But, you know there's always you have to be yourself.
[54:42.000 --> 54:43.000]  There's always you have to be yourself.
[54:43.000 --> 54:44.000]  There's always you have to be yourself.
[54:44.000 --> 54:45.000]  You have to be yourself.
[54:45.000 --> 54:46.000]  And as we said.
[54:46.000 --> 54:47.000]  And as we said.
[54:47.000 --> 54:49.000]  All of the impeach to those fees were killed for violating community
[54:49.000 --> 54:50.000]  guidelines.
[54:50.000 --> 54:51.000]  Ladies and gentlemen.
[54:51.000 --> 54:52.000]  So that's the total control.
[54:52.000 --> 54:54.000]  Now you tube is cutting Breitmark feeds from the Virginia gun rally.
[54:54.000 --> 54:56.000]  They are pissed that we have viewers.
[54:56.000 --> 54:57.000]  We have listeners.
[54:57.000 --> 54:59.000]  And people can see who we are.
[54:59.000 --> 55:02.000]  Rather than who they claim we are.
[55:02.000 --> 55:04.000]  Oh and I'm going to come back to you here in just a moment.
[55:04.000 --> 55:07.000]  And ask what comes next.
[55:07.000 --> 55:08.000]  But.
[55:08.000 --> 55:10.000]  Before he's convicted of anything not harming anybody.
[55:10.000 --> 55:14.800]  the law, if you get convicted three times disrupting Congress, then you're banned from
[55:14.800 --> 55:19.840]  the bill and usually it's five years. He hasn't been convicted once. That's what I kept saying.
[55:19.840 --> 55:25.840]  You disrupted, admit you disrupted. He didn't disrupt Congress. He injected one little bit
[55:25.840 --> 55:30.320]  of citizen truth into it and he's been arrested and he's now been in court. He's had to pay for a
[55:30.320 --> 55:34.320]  lawyer for committing a thought crime. The Democrats come in and take over those events
[55:34.320 --> 55:40.560]  with CodePick all the time. They don't get charged. Again, it's unequal weights and measures. It's
[55:40.560 --> 55:46.160]  selective enforcement and they're trying to push Owen. They're trying to bamboozle him.
[55:46.160 --> 55:52.560]  They're trying to Shanghai him. They're trying to buffalo him and yes, Owen's been sued by the
[55:52.560 --> 55:57.680]  deep state. I've been sued by the deep state. Info wars is fighting all of that and that's why
[55:57.680 --> 56:01.440]  when you buy the coffee and that's why when you buy your good fish oil from us, you buy your good
[56:01.440 --> 56:06.240]  new troubles from us and X2 that just came back in. It takes a lot of money to have the security
[56:06.240 --> 56:10.320]  and the people to do this. You see us expanding in the face of the globalist and that's because
[56:10.320 --> 56:15.760]  I've taken the savings I had as backup, mortgage my house and I'm just all in 2020 and I'm not
[56:15.760 --> 56:19.600]  complaining. I love it. They put a gun to my head. I'm not going to back down. I'm just saying
[56:19.600 --> 56:25.600]  info wars needs the full boost. You need this full boost. Step into the plate infowarstore.com.
[56:25.600 --> 56:30.000]  Get ultimate fish oil. It's about to go off sale. This is in close to selling out X2 that is the
[56:30.000 --> 56:36.640]  good halogen. Let me just show TV viewers. Let me just show TV viewers one thing here. I've got it
[56:36.640 --> 56:42.480]  in one of my folders. Okay, this is from the Journal of American Medicine Club Med.
[56:44.400 --> 56:50.080]  All of it right here. Doc Mcamp shop please. According to the World Health Organization,
[56:50.080 --> 56:55.200]  barely 2 billion individuals had insufficient iodine intake at third of being school age and it
[56:55.200 --> 57:02.240]  goes on to say it's the leading cause of intellectual disability. The number one cause on the planet
[57:03.520 --> 57:09.040]  and we're selling you the best cleanest, purest form unbound in its atomic form. Nobody else
[57:09.040 --> 57:14.000]  sells it like this. Now we have another one that is mainly Deep Earth crystal but two other types
[57:14.000 --> 57:20.880]  of clean iodine that helps some people upload it and some people like that type better. It's apples
[57:20.880 --> 57:27.280]  and oranges. It's your physiology. They're both 40% off infowarstore.com. X3 we got a few months left
[57:27.280 --> 57:33.120]  of it where you don't put another big order in but X2 just came back in 98% reviews on third-party
[57:33.120 --> 57:39.200]  sites. 6,000 plus reviews. 98% changed my life. It's the opposite of fluoride. It's what the
[57:39.200 --> 57:42.960]  global don't want you to have and it funds the info war. A total of 360 win. You're crazy if you
[57:42.960 --> 57:48.560]  don't get it for yourself and your family. Take action now infowarstore.com. I want to talk about
[57:48.560 --> 57:52.800]  super silver whitening toothpaste because I hadn't tried it except for maybe the last week and a
[57:52.800 --> 57:58.160]  half and I told Alex. I said man this is the best toothpaste I've ever tried. He's like well what are
[57:58.160 --> 58:02.240]  you doing just sitting in here telling me you got to get up there and tell people. So here I am
[58:02.240 --> 58:08.640]  telling people super silver whitening toothpaste is by far the best toothpaste I've ever tried
[58:08.640 --> 58:12.960]  and I'm 45 years old and I've tried a lot of different toothpaste and it's fluoride free.
[58:13.600 --> 58:18.240]  I think the big difference the game changer in this is the coral calcium because after I brush
[58:18.240 --> 58:23.200]  my teeth with this they feel so clean and the toothpaste that I don't even like rinse out my
[58:23.200 --> 58:29.280]  mouth after I brush my teeth with this. It feels so good. It feels like it feels like good things
[58:29.280 --> 58:35.440]  are happening in my mouth. In fact I find myself brushing my teeth three to four times a day rather
[58:35.440 --> 58:51.280]  than just twice a day now because I like the way it feels. It's time to take a new healthier approach

[1:00:22.560 --> 1:00:37.520]  Oh and Shroyer is with us for another two segments and I want to cover the waterfront with him.
[1:00:37.520 --> 1:00:41.600]  What the Virginia historic gun rally was like and how it blew up with the status which faced how
[1:00:41.600 --> 1:00:48.000]  amazing that was. What do you think they'll do next? I want to get into the ongoing fiasco of
[1:00:48.000 --> 1:00:55.120]  corruption that is the Senate trial. The Democrats are obstructing and lying and flip-flopping and
[1:00:56.480 --> 1:01:01.280]  just trying to drag this out as long as possible with Owen. But that's the next segment. Then I'm
[1:01:01.280 --> 1:01:06.160]  going to get to huge Greta Thunberg news, giant news, mainstream news about what's in the water,
[1:01:06.720 --> 1:01:12.000]  new discoveries, big discoveries on that front and we're going to take your calls, get into the
[1:01:12.000 --> 1:01:17.920]  new coronavirus and is it a super pandemic? How mysterious is it? They've been developing this
[1:01:17.920 --> 1:01:23.120]  vaccine and suddenly it gets approved with the patent and then this happens.
[1:01:24.880 --> 1:01:29.280]  We're going to talk about it all here today and as I said open the phones up. But right now let's go
[1:01:29.280 --> 1:01:34.400]  back to Owen Shroyer. Owen finishing up with the court hearing and the railroading. I was talking to
[1:01:34.400 --> 1:01:39.200]  you during the break before he came on about 20 minutes ago when you were saying that it was crazy
[1:01:39.200 --> 1:01:44.240]  that the judge was on the phone to somebody. Clearly you were saying it was the Democrats,
[1:01:44.240 --> 1:01:48.640]  it was the Capitol and that they were asking what they wanted. So it's not even a regular proceeding
[1:01:48.640 --> 1:01:55.440]  and just call up the Capitol and see what they say. Yeah very abnormal and to be clear it wasn't
[1:01:55.440 --> 1:01:59.920]  the judge, it was the state prosecuting attorney that kept having to leave the courtroom and get
[1:01:59.920 --> 1:02:06.800]  on the phone to talk to the higher ups and the only way that you can even have this order against
[1:02:06.800 --> 1:02:13.760]  you to be off Capitol grounds is if it comes directly from Congress. So this has to be coming
[1:02:13.760 --> 1:02:18.400]  from Congress. Now who, you know, we're left to guess. I think we can make a fair estimate here
[1:02:18.400 --> 1:02:22.320]  or the audience can make a fair estimate. But Alex let me just say something before I get back
[1:02:22.320 --> 1:02:28.800]  into the nuts and bolts of this and what this is really illustrating here. We have a two-tier
[1:02:28.800 --> 1:02:34.560]  justice system in this country and that's what this is illustrating right now. If you're a Democrat,
[1:02:34.560 --> 1:02:39.680]  liberal, progressive and you work with the Democrat party, you're off the hook. You don't have to go
[1:02:39.680 --> 1:02:43.760]  to court, you don't have to go to jail, you don't get arrested, you don't get a record. Just look
[1:02:43.760 --> 1:02:48.800]  at Jane Fonda doing it every day. There's not even a paper trail of her ever being arrested.
[1:02:48.800 --> 1:02:53.840]  But she has done this dozens of times. If you're Jerry Nadler and you sit up there and obstruct
[1:02:53.840 --> 1:02:59.360]  Congress or say oh how dare Trump obstruct our fake impeachment hoax against them and they make
[1:02:59.360 --> 1:03:03.280]  up a bunch of things, they pay protesters come out here that have no idea what the impeachment is
[1:03:03.280 --> 1:03:10.560]  even about. But oh my gosh, if you're one lowly peon, if you're one tiny little aunt, one little
[1:03:10.560 --> 1:03:16.080]  citizen that dares stand up for your rights, that dares stand up to the... But let's just say this,
[1:03:16.080 --> 1:03:20.640]  obviously this came from Nadler and I'm not normally gay, but he is one hot man.
[1:03:25.040 --> 1:03:29.440]  You know what, I'm not attracted to Oompa Loompas, Alex, so I'm not going to comment on that.
[1:03:29.440 --> 1:03:34.560]  Oompa Loompas are attractive compared to this guy. He looks like he ate the Constitution
[1:03:34.560 --> 1:03:39.520]  and about a hundred children at the same time as like side or derbs. I mean, nothing against
[1:03:39.520 --> 1:03:45.680]  fat people. My God, he is the most ridiculous looking person I've ever seen. And then on top
[1:03:45.680 --> 1:03:52.400]  of the arrogance and the insolence, I mean, what a joke. But Alex, they're showing their weakness.
[1:03:52.400 --> 1:03:59.040]  Their weakness is civil disobedience. Their weakness is people taking action. I just happen
[1:03:59.040 --> 1:04:03.200]  to be the one that does it and gets the viral video. That's their weakness. That's why they're
[1:04:03.200 --> 1:04:06.960]  trying to make an example out of me. That's why they're trying to hang me in the public square
[1:04:06.960 --> 1:04:11.280]  because they want to intimidate all the American citizens out of their free speech. They want to
[1:04:11.280 --> 1:04:15.280]  say, if you dare take a stand, we're going to arrest you and tarnish your name and drag you
[1:04:15.280 --> 1:04:20.240]  through court and ban you from Capitol Grounds. And you won't even have free speech, you little
[1:04:20.240 --> 1:04:24.560]  peon slave. That's what they want to do. They're trying to intimidate people out of their free speech.
[1:04:24.560 --> 1:04:30.080]  They want to create the projection that everybody agrees with the Democrats and they speak for
[1:04:30.080 --> 1:04:34.720]  the people. But that backfires on them every time. It's why everybody needs to go to Congress
[1:04:34.720 --> 1:04:38.640]  and not go into the chambers and do it. But legally and lawfully in the halls, talk to your
[1:04:38.640 --> 1:04:43.200]  representatives. That's not illegal. That's civic virtue. And that's a good thing because
[1:04:43.200 --> 1:04:47.520]  these representatives, the Democrats are a bunch of out of control criminals. We need to use the
[1:04:47.520 --> 1:04:52.480]  First Amendment to stop them starting a civil war. Then we have to use the Second Amendment.
[1:04:52.480 --> 1:04:55.120]  None of us want that to happen. So let's fight hard now.

[1:06:21.520 --> 1:06:36.400]  Owen Schreuer joins us right outside the White House in Washington, D.C. He was just in court
[1:06:36.400 --> 1:06:43.920]  today. Democrats, when they go, sorrow astroturf and throw themselves down and take over congressional
[1:06:43.920 --> 1:06:49.520]  hearings for hours on end, their praise is wonderful. Activist CNN, MSNBC, you know,
[1:06:49.520 --> 1:06:53.200]  the memes are out there showing us heroes and great job at the Kavanaugh hearings.
[1:06:54.720 --> 1:06:58.960]  But when Owen Schreuer politely but focused says, no, you're the ones involved in treason,
[1:06:58.960 --> 1:07:03.440]  this is all a charade of fraud. Like 30 seconds goes out, the police are letting him go, and all
[1:07:03.440 --> 1:07:08.000]  of a sudden, oh, wait, no, no, you're going to jail, you're having the book thrown at you, and then
[1:07:08.000 --> 1:07:14.480]  today the judge didn't give him a $500 fine or something and said, don't do it again, which is
[1:07:14.480 --> 1:07:19.200]  what they do rarely. That's the extreme end of prosecution. They said, you're getting drug
[1:07:19.200 --> 1:07:25.600]  tested, you're going to prison. The prosecutor was on the phone with Congress and by law, only
[1:07:25.600 --> 1:07:30.640]  members of Congress at executive levels can call for someone to be completely banned. And the
[1:07:30.640 --> 1:07:37.120]  Democrats called for M4's reporter Owen Schreuer to be banned and openly called for him to not be
[1:07:37.120 --> 1:07:42.000]  able to go around and even interview people basically in Congress. Totally unconstitutional.
[1:07:42.000 --> 1:07:45.600]  We've got to file an injunction on this. Norm Pattis is my great First Amendment lawyer. We've
[1:07:45.600 --> 1:07:50.240]  got to get him involved in this now because this is out of control. Recapping and finishing up on
[1:07:50.240 --> 1:07:55.120]  that, Owen, then I'm going to get into all the big breaking news with you. Yeah, again, Alex,
[1:07:55.120 --> 1:07:59.920]  this is just illustrative of what our government thinks about us. Unless, of course, you're a
[1:07:59.920 --> 1:08:05.120]  liberal Democrat, then you have carte blanche to disrupt Congress or do whatever the hell you want.
[1:08:05.120 --> 1:08:10.800]  But if you're a God-fearing, freedom-loving American patriot, well, then you are the
[1:08:10.800 --> 1:08:14.880]  kryptonite of the corrupt government. And so they must shut you down. But yes, Alex,
[1:08:14.880 --> 1:08:20.640]  they tried to ban me from all Capitol buildings and government offices and congressional offices.
[1:08:20.640 --> 1:08:25.280]  We fought that at the first court level. We moved up to another administrative court level.
[1:08:25.280 --> 1:08:29.360]  A second judge hurt us. A second state prosecutor brought the exact same things,
[1:08:29.360 --> 1:08:34.320]  trying to shut me down. This judge said, absolutely not. That's the First Amendment right. But
[1:08:34.320 --> 1:08:40.000]  we will issue a no-hats order, which basically gags me inside Senate chambers so that I can't
[1:08:40.000 --> 1:08:46.720]  speak or as they want not raise the truth in a very powerful manner. And so what's shocking to
[1:08:46.720 --> 1:08:53.120]  me about this, too, Alex, is that how many people are witnessing this just in the chain of command,
[1:08:53.120 --> 1:08:57.280]  just seeing this corruption and just going along with it and not raising hell about it
[1:08:57.280 --> 1:09:01.120]  and not saying, you know what, no, I'm not going to be part of an unconstitutional order from
[1:09:01.120 --> 1:09:06.080]  Congress. No, I'm not going to be part of an anti-free speech order from Congress. No, I'm not
[1:09:06.080 --> 1:09:11.280]  going to take part in a two-tiered justice system where the celebrity failed actor Jane Fonda gets
[1:09:11.280 --> 1:09:16.000]  to get arrested dozens of times and then doesn't even have a paper trail because it never even makes
[1:09:16.000 --> 1:09:21.360]  it to the D.C. police or to the courthouse. So that's incredible. But again, folks need to
[1:09:21.360 --> 1:09:26.320]  understand this is their kryptonite. What happened in Virginia on Monday is their kryptonite.
[1:09:26.320 --> 1:09:30.640]  What I did in Congress to Jerry Nadler is their kryptonite. That's why they're trying to shut
[1:09:30.640 --> 1:09:34.880]  it down. That's why they tried to intimidate us from rallying in Virginia. That's why they're
[1:09:34.880 --> 1:09:38.880]  trying to make an example out of me so that you won't go up there and stand up to your
[1:09:38.880 --> 1:09:44.320]  congressman. It's all totally illegal. It's all totally unconstitutional. It's all anti-free
[1:09:44.320 --> 1:09:49.600]  speech. And this is what the Democrats are doing right now. It's no holds barred. It's no holds
[1:09:49.600 --> 1:09:52.880]  barred right now. And look, I understand this isn't, I'm not going to sit here and say, oh,
[1:09:52.880 --> 1:09:57.520]  Trump saved me. But President Trump needs to realize how important this is. And I understand
[1:09:57.520 --> 1:10:01.360]  he's got trade deals and he's trying to stop illegal immigration and he's trying to do all the
[1:10:01.360 --> 1:10:05.200]  stuff with the deep state that he's dealing with, which we probably can't even imagine. But he needs
[1:10:05.200 --> 1:10:10.640]  to understand his supporters are being choked out right now. They're being put in a chokehold
[1:10:10.640 --> 1:10:16.240]  by these Democrats in Congress and by the mainstream news and by the social media tech giant.
[1:10:16.240 --> 1:10:20.080]  And if he doesn't do something about it, we're all going to get choked out. And he's not going
[1:10:20.080 --> 1:10:25.680]  to have anybody voicing support for him. So he really needs to continue to hammer on this.
[1:10:25.680 --> 1:10:30.560]  He needs to say, hey, look, what you did to Roger Stone was illegal. Hey, what you did to Mike Flynn
[1:10:30.560 --> 1:10:35.440]  was illegal. You guys are running the impeachment scam. You guys are the ones that framed evidence.
[1:10:35.440 --> 1:10:40.560]  You guys are the ones that's filed illegally. Let's put you on trial. Barack Obama. Let's put
[1:10:40.560 --> 1:10:46.240]  you on trial. James Clapper and Jim Comey. Let's look at the perjury that you committed. And so
[1:10:46.240 --> 1:10:50.400]  the day we get that, maybe it's the day we get justice. But until then, Americans are going to
[1:10:50.400 --> 1:10:55.440]  have to keep scratching and clawing for justice and really just making an example of everything
[1:10:55.440 --> 1:10:59.040]  that we have to put up with as second class citizens in the United States of America,
[1:10:59.040 --> 1:11:03.840]  which quite frankly, Alex has me boiling inside. But I've given this up to God and I'm praying to
[1:11:03.840 --> 1:11:08.880]  God for the patience and the guidance to handle this in the best manner I possibly can. And I
[1:11:08.880 --> 1:11:15.840]  trust that God is going to give me that guidance. And hopefully, hopefully, mainstream news will
[1:11:15.840 --> 1:11:20.640]  cover this story. And of course, we're not counting on CNN or MSNBC or the outfit networks, but
[1:11:20.640 --> 1:11:26.720]  maybe a Fox News hit. Maybe a Fox News hit would be nice. We know President Trump watches Fox News.
[1:11:26.720 --> 1:11:30.880]  We know they have the top ratings on cable news, but they don't want to touch info wars either
[1:11:30.880 --> 1:11:35.920]  because they're still scared to death of you, the audience calling out the truth. So we got a
[1:11:35.920 --> 1:11:40.400]  lot of developments coming. Again, I'm due back in court next week. So I'll have more answers
[1:11:40.400 --> 1:11:44.720]  then as to how this is going to go. But this is what you get. You're treated like a second class
[1:11:44.720 --> 1:11:49.920]  citizen in this country. If you're a God fearing, freedom loving, gun totan, American patriot,
[1:11:49.920 --> 1:11:54.240]  they want to lock you up, make an example of you, censor your free speech, take away your second
[1:11:54.240 --> 1:11:59.440]  amendment. And as long as Americans stand up and fight it, we won't lose. But if we lay down and
[1:11:59.440 --> 1:12:05.440]  we we fall victim to the intimidation, we fall victim to the anti free speech and the censorship
[1:12:05.440 --> 1:12:10.080]  and we fall victim to the intimidation with the anti second amendment laws and we fall victim to
[1:12:13.280 --> 1:12:21.200]  when we can't adapt to submission, we have to adapt to overcoming. And we don't need Fox News.
[1:12:21.200 --> 1:12:27.680]  We need them to recognize the attacks on speech to rally America and to make it one of the central
[1:12:27.680 --> 1:12:32.160]  issues that only Tucker Carlson is doing. And he's like the conscience of America right now.
[1:12:32.880 --> 1:12:36.800]  And we need the American people to understand this is front and center. And we need the president
[1:12:36.800 --> 1:12:40.560]  to do it because that's what's happening. The power comes from the people. And you're right,
[1:12:40.560 --> 1:12:45.520]  the kryptonite of their tyranny was all those peaceful citizens coming together in mass and
[1:12:45.520 --> 1:12:50.560]  peacefully exercising their first and second amendment Virginia and what the governor predicted
[1:12:50.560 --> 1:12:55.840]  didn't happen. And that's the power of the people and the people taking action. But as you said,
[1:12:57.200 --> 1:13:03.120]  when you have judicial watch and Breitbart and right side broadcasting and a bunch of other
[1:13:03.120 --> 1:13:13.680]  people who go and buy feeds that anybody can do, HD feeds, some events are expensive, some are cheap.
[1:13:14.320 --> 1:13:19.600]  You can go get for the cost pool footage, live feed, anybody could call up, do it,
[1:13:19.600 --> 1:13:23.600]  have it connected their terminal, their computer, restream it. Okay, you have a million subscribers.
[1:13:24.880 --> 1:13:31.760]  And when they did that, YouTube guaranteed had CNN contact them. But it's in the news that they
[1:13:31.760 --> 1:13:37.760]  said this is a community guidelines violation and banned a bunch of conservative groups by judicial
[1:13:37.760 --> 1:13:42.080]  watch from carrying their own feed so they could talk over it and have their own commentary.
[1:13:42.080 --> 1:13:47.920]  They don't want our analysis. They want only dinosaur media to have that. And that's racketeering.
[1:13:47.920 --> 1:13:53.920]  That's organized crime. So I say to judicial watch, do something about the attacks on speech.
[1:13:53.920 --> 1:13:59.920]  Now, Professor Epstein is saying, yeah, he thinks his wife was probably murdered. And I can't tell
[1:13:59.920 --> 1:14:03.680]  you the behind the scenes stuff going on with Epstein. I'm just going to leave it at that.
[1:14:03.680 --> 1:14:08.000]  But I can tell you that I was waiting for him to say that. And I can tell you he's been thinking
[1:14:08.000 --> 1:14:11.360]  that day one, and I can tell you there's some other stuff involved that all big techs kind of
[1:14:11.360 --> 1:14:14.960]  do is dial into the new cars. They can take control of them and drive your right off a clip if they
[1:14:14.960 --> 1:14:21.200]  want. And so that's what we've been telling Epstein. Before we go to break because this is very
[1:14:22.080 --> 1:14:29.280]  we switched courts. We literally switched courts after the first trial. So we moved up new judge,
[1:14:29.280 --> 1:14:35.120]  new prosecuting attorney. So this prosecuting attorney would have no inference as to who I
[1:14:35.120 --> 1:14:39.360]  am or what I was doing there. He just gets this handed down. But you know what he did,
[1:14:39.360 --> 1:14:44.080]  he brought up to the judge the video from yesterday that wasn't even my video. It was Rob
[1:14:44.080 --> 1:14:50.640]  Dew's video of me confronting the impeach Trump protesters. And he used that as a case against
[1:14:50.640 --> 1:14:55.360]  me to say, see, he can't be allowed in these buildings. He just did this yesterday, too.
[1:14:55.360 --> 1:14:59.200]  Even though I broke no laws yesterday, I didn't. There was no laws broken. I even talked to
[1:14:59.200 --> 1:15:03.600]  all you did was show they're out there chanting. They're out there having their events. You
[1:15:03.600 --> 1:15:08.320]  reported on them. And you did. And so it got all over the news and it got a whole bunch of
[1:15:08.320 --> 1:15:13.440]  views. And so being successful, being effective is what they want to silence. That is disgusting.
[1:15:13.440 --> 1:15:17.440]  What that prosecutor did. And it should all be thrown out right there. What did the judge do
[1:15:17.440 --> 1:15:22.800]  when they said that? Again, the judge said this is a violation of the First Amendment. I'm not
[1:15:22.800 --> 1:15:25.920]  going to ban him from any capitol buildings. I'm not going to ban him from congressional
[1:15:25.920 --> 1:15:29.760]  offices. He has every right to be there. He doesn't have a criminal record that would indicate he
[1:15:29.760 --> 1:15:35.120]  has any abusive behavior. But again, Alex, this shows you they're literally monitoring everything
[1:15:35.120 --> 1:15:39.440]  we do. Someone called up this prosecutor who just got this case handed to him and said,
[1:15:39.440 --> 1:15:42.720]  bring up the video we had yesterday. Bring up that you're still doing this. So they're literally
[1:15:42.720 --> 1:15:47.600]  getting called. They don't want the American people to have any voice. Great job. Oh, and Shroyer
[1:15:47.600 --> 1:15:52.480]  watch all his live videos as they get filed at band.video. Great job. Oh, and we'll talk to you
[1:15:52.480 --> 1:15:59.840]  again soon. And Savannah. Heart disease is on the rise. Clogged arteries, high blood pressure,

[1:19:02.320 --> 1:19:09.680]  the American people, and Alex Jones of InfoWars. Our operations with our partners, the Communist
[1:19:09.680 --> 1:19:17.520]  Chinese, have bought control of your media. But it's true, your people are beginning to awaken.
[1:19:17.520 --> 1:19:25.200]  That's why Cobra is launching operations to trigger race war, mass shootings, and bombings,
[1:19:25.200 --> 1:19:32.480]  which will be blamed on those loyal to America. Anyone once we stage these attacks that does
[1:19:32.480 --> 1:19:42.000]  not blame it on Trump will also be targeted by Cobra in the future. You see, when you expose our
[1:19:42.000 --> 1:19:49.360]  false flags and fake media, I will carry out attacks and then blame you like we've done with
[1:19:49.360 --> 1:20:12.960]  Alex Jones blaming him for mass shootings we committed. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:20:19.360 --> 1:20:38.960]  You can hear it, you can hear it, you can hear it, you want to make it.
[1:20:38.960 --> 1:20:44.960]  Remember what Colossus said two years ago, we were always going to impeach Trump from the beginning.
[1:20:44.960 --> 1:20:50.480]  One of the biggest criticisms of the process has been the speed at which the House Democrats are
[1:20:50.480 --> 1:20:55.760]  moving. If this is, but seriously, though, seriously. It's been going on for 22 months, okay?
[1:20:55.760 --> 1:21:02.880]  What a lot. Two and a half years. So there you go. It's all premeditated. It's all a fraud. It's
[1:21:02.880 --> 1:21:07.920]  all a big joke. And that's always been their goal. And so now after stalling a few more days with
[1:21:07.920 --> 1:21:13.840]  wrangling, the trial has officially begun. As we speak, let's let's go to what's happening
[1:21:13.840 --> 1:21:19.360]  currently live and then Savannah Hernandez right outside Congress to give her take. Here it is.
[1:21:20.400 --> 1:21:26.320]  Effort to smear Mr. Biden, reportedly hacking into the Ukrainian energy company at the center
[1:21:26.320 --> 1:21:32.000]  of the president's disinformation campaign only last week. It pause again. It's live.
[1:21:33.200 --> 1:21:36.800]  It's always shift. The Democrats have had like 90% of the talk time.
[1:21:36.800 --> 1:21:43.760]  Trump's never been able to put on his defense yet. He gets two days next week to do it. And it's shift.
[1:21:43.760 --> 1:21:50.880]  The Russians reportedly hacked into the energy company that Hunter Biden's involved. And so
[1:21:50.880 --> 1:21:58.320]  it's okay what he did because somebody reports out of their rear end. It's all in your window.
[1:21:58.320 --> 1:22:04.640]  Holy Toledo. Let's go back live to shift and see what the new BSS was looking for information
[1:22:04.640 --> 1:22:11.360]  related to the former vice president's son so that the Kremlin could also weaponize it against
[1:22:11.360 --> 1:22:17.920]  Mr. Biden just like it did against Hillary Clinton in 2016 when Russia hacked and released emails from
[1:22:17.920 --> 1:22:22.800]  her president. So they're merging Russia gate that's already failed with Ukraine gate. It's just the
[1:22:22.800 --> 1:22:27.520]  same same BS again. Please continue, chef. And President Trump has made it abundantly clear
[1:22:28.480 --> 1:22:33.280]  that he would like nothing more than to make use of such dirt against Mr. Biden
[1:22:33.280 --> 1:22:37.680]  just as he made use of Secretary Clinton's hacked and released emails.
[1:22:37.680 --> 1:22:41.840]  Yeah. Her criminal activity is her criminal activity regardless of where it comes from.
[1:22:41.840 --> 1:22:47.360]  But what's amazing is they have House and Senate hearings where they say I'm a Russian agent with
[1:22:47.360 --> 1:22:51.920]  no proof and I don't get to face my accusers. And no one was freaking out. He's going to different
[1:22:51.920 --> 1:22:57.520]  courtrooms and the prosecutors are there going this man was interviewing people at the Capitol
[1:22:57.520 --> 1:23:04.080]  again yesterday and the judge is like, well, that's totally normal. But they're trying to ban
[1:23:04.080 --> 1:23:14.800]  these people are tyrants, tyrannous. And thus the tyrants as the logo in Virginia shows the goddess
[1:23:14.800 --> 1:23:20.800]  with her leg on the neck of the tyrant who she slain. These people are tyrants, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:23:21.360 --> 1:23:24.480]  And I want to beat them in the information war. That's why they want a physical war because
[1:23:24.480 --> 1:23:28.000]  they know we're winning. Let's go back and hear more from ship. We have enough from him.
[1:23:29.520 --> 1:23:34.880]  That President Trump demanded that the Ukrainian leader announce this investigation was related
[1:23:34.880 --> 1:23:42.080]  to a debunk conspiracy theory alleging that Ukraine not Russia interfered in the 2016
[1:23:42.080 --> 1:23:49.200]  presidential election. This narrative propagated by the Russian intelligence services contends
[1:23:49.200 --> 1:23:55.280]  that Ukraine sought to help Hillary Clinton and harm then candidate Trump, and that a computer
[1:23:55.280 --> 1:24:02.320]  server providing this fiction is hidden somewhere in Ukraine. That is the so called
[1:24:02.320 --> 1:24:05.760]  crowd straight. I'm not going to go over the whole issue as everybody knows that the deep
[1:24:05.760 --> 1:24:10.080]  state's been laundering billions a year through Ukraine. It was right back to Soros that's then
[1:24:10.080 --> 1:24:14.080]  paid back to deep state government employees and their wives and husbands. And that the dossier
[1:24:14.080 --> 1:24:20.560]  is up to 47 million now, passed around for a year of the election and now three years after
[1:24:20.560 --> 1:24:24.880]  to the friends and family, where some of them are paid over a million a piece to add
[1:24:25.440 --> 1:24:30.320]  innuendo and crap to it. Like, oh, there's hookers pissing on him and, you know, pigs flying out of
[1:24:30.320 --> 1:24:38.800]  his, you know, where I mean, it's unbelievable. The rape of justice, the rape of the process.
[1:24:38.800 --> 1:24:46.400]  I am a Russian agent like I'm a Chinese jet pilot from Mars. And so is Trump.
[1:24:47.920 --> 1:24:51.840]  If Trump's done anything, it's been militaristically kicking the snot out of the Russians and
[1:24:52.400 --> 1:24:57.040]  putting sanctions on them and pushing up on Russia's borders with weapons, which is terrible.
[1:24:57.600 --> 1:25:01.200]  China is what's crawling all over us right now. If Russia was doing anything to us,
[1:25:01.200 --> 1:25:03.120]  I'd be in Russia's face. Just not true.
[1:25:03.120 --> 1:25:11.200]  Savannah Hernandez has been in D.C. for a week. She's been in Virginia. She's seen so much.
[1:25:12.320 --> 1:25:18.000]  And now to witness this, to be there, this history, Savannah, what's your, what's your top story?
[1:25:18.000 --> 1:25:19.440]  What's your big takeaway right now?
[1:25:25.040 --> 1:25:28.800]  Well, that was perfect timing. Boom. So we'll get her back on a little bit later.
[1:25:28.800 --> 1:25:34.800]  Now, let me tell you what I want to get to here today, ladies and gentlemen, because there is a
[1:25:35.440 --> 1:25:40.960]  lot on our plate, a lot that we're going to be breaking down.
[1:25:42.320 --> 1:25:47.040]  It's a new story that's very, very important. We're done. It's okay. We'll do it later.
[1:25:47.040 --> 1:25:48.880]  We're done now. Let's shut this down. Thanks, guys.
[1:25:48.880 --> 1:26:00.720]  A Chinese virus mutation draws comparison to 12 monkeys movie and boy does it.
[1:26:00.720 --> 1:26:07.120]  And the fact that it was just recently patented for vaccine is just special, isn't it?
[1:26:07.120 --> 1:26:12.160]  We're going to be getting to all of that when we come back. Also, Trump calls out Greta
[1:26:12.160 --> 1:26:20.400]  for staying silent about China and India pollution. Yeah, that's where 90% of it comes from India and
[1:26:20.400 --> 1:26:25.600]  China. That's admitted. Almost all the garbage in the ocean is purposely dumped by China.
[1:26:26.320 --> 1:26:31.920]  But you never know that and no celebrity will say a word because China is G.O.D. left.
[1:26:32.880 --> 1:26:37.840]  Godless authoritarian anti-Christian running giant death camps couldn't be better.
[1:26:37.840 --> 1:26:43.040]  So we'll get to Trump calling her out, but also her hit learning. And I have warned you.
[1:26:43.040 --> 1:26:50.240]  I have told you, you need to panic. You must do what I say. And they don't even see how authoritarian
[1:26:50.240 --> 1:26:55.440]  and whacked out she is. Looks like she's eight years old. She's 16. Her dad now has been caught
[1:26:56.160 --> 1:27:01.680]  posing as her online. Of course, it's the Antifa parents. They're both say they're Antifa.
[1:27:01.680 --> 1:27:09.360]  A Swedish whacked out crazy leftist with their brain damaged vaccine head daughter.
[1:27:10.320 --> 1:27:15.680]  But everyone was a concentration camp victim running around sounding hit Larry and even the
[1:27:15.680 --> 1:27:25.040]  accent. It's all just too insane. But also want to look back on the big victories that we've had
[1:27:25.040 --> 1:27:28.880]  in Virginia and how everything the governor said was going to happen. Didn't happen,
[1:27:28.880 --> 1:27:33.840]  but he still declared his attempt to kettle everybody in together and cause some type of
[1:27:33.840 --> 1:27:40.880]  disaster failed. And they're now passing their semi-automatic gun bands, their red flag,
[1:27:40.880 --> 1:27:45.840]  killing due process laws. It's all in the verge of passing right now. We've got an update on that.
[1:27:45.840 --> 1:27:50.240]  First, the good, the bad and the ugly when we come back. But please remember as viewers and
[1:27:50.240 --> 1:27:55.280]  listeners, this isn't like this is mainstream media. You receive the talking points in the BS
[1:27:55.280 --> 1:27:58.880]  and we're funded by the globalists and big mega banks, Goldman Sachs and the chai comms.
[1:27:59.760 --> 1:28:05.760]  Info wars isn't just funded by you. It is you. You're the reason it's here. You're our sponsors.
[1:28:06.560 --> 1:28:10.480]  Leftists come up being screaming go who's funding you because they're always fun about
[1:28:10.480 --> 1:28:16.560]  somebody and I go, uh, these people all around me in Virginia. Almost everybody at that gun rally
[1:28:16.560 --> 1:28:22.720]  was a listener. Maybe one out of 200 people who said they were pro gun would say, Alex,
[1:28:22.720 --> 1:28:26.400]  I think you're embarrassing or I wish you weren't here. Go back to your state or whatever.
[1:28:27.200 --> 1:28:31.200]  As if people try to take my guns in Virginia and it didn't try to take my guns here in Austin.
[1:28:31.200 --> 1:28:36.320]  It's all of us together and separate. I mean, people are awake and it's beautiful. And to be out
[1:28:36.320 --> 1:28:40.560]  there in the middle of that was very empowering. One of the greatest days of my life to be out there
[1:28:40.560 --> 1:28:44.320]  with those great Virginians, incredible people and great Americans. So when we come back, we're
[1:28:44.320 --> 1:28:50.640]  going to lay it all out straight ahead. This is the info war. This is America. This is the pro
[1:28:50.640 --> 1:28:58.320]  human resistance against the technocracy takeover. Hi, I'm Dan Pilla. I started fighting the IRS
[1:28:58.320 --> 1:29:02.880]  over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house. I sued the IRS in one. I beat
[1:29:02.880 --> 1:29:07.520]  the IRS then and I've been beating them ever since. I wrote the book on tax debt settlement and I've
[1:29:07.520 --> 1:29:11.600]  helped thousands of people deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved. I can help
[1:29:11.600 --> 1:29:16.240]  you too. If you owe taxes, you can't pay. Don't wait another day. There's no such thing as a

[1:29:29.680 --> 1:29:34.960]  if I told you for just 54.95 a month, you could fight against heart disease naturally at heart
[1:29:34.960 --> 1:29:39.520]  and body extract. We've been helping thousands of people get back to a healthier heart. Don't

[1:29:56.800 --> 1:30:02.320]  If you understand why the globalist, why the servants of Satan hate infowars, it's because
[1:30:02.320 --> 1:30:09.680]  we're awake, we're alive, we're passionate, and we're not giving up. That's why it's critical
[1:30:09.680 --> 1:30:15.520]  for those of us that are aware of the New World Order's plans to not get down when they attack us
[1:30:15.520 --> 1:30:20.640]  and they persecute us and they lie about us. That's what we should expect because we are
[1:30:20.640 --> 1:30:25.840]  hurting these scumbags. The globalists have literally sold their souls to the dark side
[1:30:25.840 --> 1:30:30.880]  and they do what they do because they're slaves because they are eternally driven to try to
[1:30:30.880 --> 1:30:37.440]  suppress and dominate and destroy the innocent. It is up to us who are awake, not the sheep and not
[1:30:37.440 --> 1:30:45.280]  the wolves, but the sheepdogs to stand firm and resist these wicked tyrants. They fear the fact
[1:30:45.280 --> 1:30:52.400]  that we are awake. They fear the fact that we are alive. They fear the fact that we love God
[1:30:52.400 --> 1:30:58.160]  and that's all we ever have to know is that God is in charge. I would thank you for everything
[1:30:58.160 --> 1:31:03.600]  you've done for the infowar, but I know you're like me. You don't want my thanks. You want victory
[1:31:03.600 --> 1:31:07.680]  over the globalists and these devil worship and child molesters and you want them off your back
[1:31:07.680 --> 1:31:12.080]  and off your children's back and you know what? I'm the same way and that's why we're on the same
[1:31:12.080 --> 1:31:18.640]  damn team and it's why infowars has been delivering time and time again when it's clutch time to
[1:31:19.760 --> 1:31:24.000]  focus the people on taking action against the globalist because I'm committed to a future
[1:31:24.000 --> 1:31:30.640]  for humanity and I know you are as well. So thank you in 2019 for standing with us because
[1:31:30.640 --> 1:31:35.360]  you are the infowar and I want to thank you for committing to stand with us in 2020 however you
[1:31:35.360 --> 1:31:40.240]  can. For the bottom of my heart, for my family and for the great crew at Infowars, I want to thank
[1:31:40.240 --> 1:31:46.080]  you all because you are the Infowar and you know that's not just words, that's reality. You have
[1:31:46.080 --> 1:31:54.960]  made history. We have made history together. Infowars.com only has power because of you and I suggest
[1:31:54.960 --> 1:32:01.680]  you use it. 25 years ago when I first began broadcasting, I was a realist and I was honest
[1:32:01.680 --> 1:32:07.760]  with the listeners. America was in a coma. We were being absolutely poisoned physically,
[1:32:07.760 --> 1:32:14.400]  culturally and spiritually. The New World Order was running rampant because the public was asleep.
[1:32:14.400 --> 1:32:21.760]  Fast forward to this year and 2020 and to see the Soros spend over $100 million on the women's
[1:32:21.760 --> 1:32:29.120]  march here in D.C. and Los Angeles and they might have had 30,000 people, maybe. They had five million
[1:32:29.120 --> 1:32:36.720]  three years ago, ladies and gentlemen, I was here. That is emblematic of how his money and Chica money
[1:32:36.720 --> 1:32:42.960]  cannot buy them the Astro Turf anymore. So yes, the awakenings happened but we're not out of the
[1:32:42.960 --> 1:32:48.320]  woods. The globalists are going to throw a bunch of Hail Marys during this Trump Senate trial
[1:32:48.320 --> 1:33:13.680]  and we're going to be covering it live from D.C. at ban.video. Please be Paul Revere and share this link.
[1:33:48.400 --> 1:34:11.760]  You know, this happens here on air and in the interest of total transparency.
[1:34:12.880 --> 1:34:15.760]  I was already going to play this later in the fourth hour. I'm going to play it now
[1:34:15.760 --> 1:34:22.720]  because it's so important and we've got so many incredible clips from what happened in Virginia
[1:34:23.520 --> 1:34:29.680]  that during a short break trying to decide again which ones we're going to play because they're
[1:34:29.680 --> 1:34:35.120]  all so powerful and then other people come in the room and ask questions. It's not a problem.
[1:34:35.120 --> 1:34:39.120]  We're just an open newsroom in here. You know, we're too few people doing too much. I'm not
[1:34:39.120 --> 1:34:46.000]  complaining that I get angry and I've learned instead of getting angry, just say, hey, I'm going
[1:34:46.000 --> 1:34:50.320]  to pick what I think is one of the most important reports and just play almost the whole thing.
[1:34:50.880 --> 1:34:54.800]  This is a ten and a half minute segment. We're already nine minutes into it,
[1:34:54.800 --> 1:35:01.200]  but the report is up on infowars.com and up on newswars.com and it's really powerful and it's
[1:35:01.200 --> 1:35:06.880]  important and the only way it gets out to new people is when you share it and there's just so
[1:35:06.880 --> 1:35:13.280]  many hundreds of new videos a day at band.video. It's just crazy how much infowars is putting out
[1:35:13.280 --> 1:35:18.960]  thanks to your support and your prayers and there's a really powerful report Black Guns Matter
[1:35:18.960 --> 1:35:25.200]  that's again ten minutes long, the Millie Weaver put out, Richmond Narrative Shattered,
[1:35:25.200 --> 1:35:31.040]  super powerful, Caitlin Bennett and all these others that we filed and Owen filed and what I
[1:35:31.040 --> 1:35:36.960]  witnessed in the USA Chance and how it blew up in Northam's face, which I'll get to next segment,
[1:35:36.960 --> 1:35:41.360]  then I'll get into the latest virus news, then I'll get into the big news on what is in our
[1:35:41.360 --> 1:35:47.920]  water and Trump countering Greta Thunberg and the reports up on infowars.com and then we'll get to
[1:35:47.920 --> 1:35:53.760]  a lot of calls in the third into the fourth hour here today, but let's just go to this report
[1:35:54.480 --> 1:35:59.280]  because it's a form of frustration that's actually we ought to be glad about to have so much powerful
[1:35:59.280 --> 1:36:04.080]  stuff that we're having heated debates about what to go to. So I just think we should go
[1:36:04.720 --> 1:36:12.640]  to a large portion of this Millie Weaver report Black Guns Matter. Here it is.
[1:36:13.360 --> 1:36:18.640]  The message that I'm here to spread is to let the know that I'm tired of the
[1:36:19.920 --> 1:36:25.280]  threats to our rights, taking our rights away and making us pretty much criminals and felons
[1:36:25.280 --> 1:36:30.640]  overnight of these laws to do pass. And we just thinking tired of it. I mean, as you can see,
[1:36:30.640 --> 1:36:41.120]  the numbers out here says a lot. So we're here with Chuck Smith. You ran for Attorney General,
[1:36:41.120 --> 1:36:46.400]  and now you're out here participating in this Second Amendment rally. Why is the Second Amendment
[1:36:46.400 --> 1:36:51.920]  so important to you? Constitution is important. The Second Amendment is just one part of the
[1:36:51.920 --> 1:36:56.560]  Constitution. Listen, if they steamroll the Second Amendment, they'll steamroll everything else.
[1:36:56.560 --> 1:37:01.440]  People are concerned about their rights to bear arms. That's not a state right. That's a United
[1:37:01.440 --> 1:37:06.960]  States Constitution right. At the end of the day, we've got to get the government on board with the
[1:37:06.960 --> 1:37:11.920]  fact that they just can't suspend the Constitution or any part of it when they get ready. You've
[1:37:11.920 --> 1:37:17.280]  got people who are concerned, not just that the government has an ulterior motive, but the government
[1:37:17.280 --> 1:37:24.640]  doesn't appreciate rights of the citizens. You know, the rights were given to each of the citizens
[1:37:24.640 --> 1:37:30.320]  of Virginia by the United States government. They weren't given by Virginia, so Virginia can't take
[1:37:30.320 --> 1:37:36.160]  it away. The governor has done something which I think is really unprecedented. Nowhere, anywhere
[1:37:36.160 --> 1:37:41.520]  can you get a law or an order for a law based on your suspicion that something might happen.
[1:37:41.520 --> 1:37:46.000]  What do you think about how the media has been spinning this, that this is all a bunch of radical
[1:37:46.000 --> 1:37:52.160]  extremists out here today that, you know, have bad intentions or have racial intentions and that
[1:37:52.160 --> 1:37:59.600]  this is like a thing that everyone should be afraid of? Of course they would say that to help
[1:38:01.280 --> 1:38:08.720]  push their narrative and kind of deceive the people into thinking that we are the bad guys,
[1:38:08.720 --> 1:38:15.600]  when simply we just want to hold on to our rights to protect ourselves. Have you seen any KKK
[1:38:15.600 --> 1:38:21.760]  or whatnot out here? Nope, haven't seen one. Matter of fact, John, come here. This is a sponsor to
[1:38:21.760 --> 1:38:29.520]  my podcast. Also, director for gun owners of America for Virginia. If this is a white supremacist
[1:38:29.520 --> 1:38:35.280]  movement, why would my sponsor who is a white guy sponsoring a black podcast be here? This just
[1:38:35.280 --> 1:38:40.720]  doesn't add up, right? But at the same time, pro gunners have to be better with PR. We have to
[1:38:40.720 --> 1:38:46.000]  get better at showing the diversity in the second amendment community. So we're definitely here to
[1:38:46.000 --> 1:38:49.840]  show this unity because the media will play and act like we don't deal with each other very well.
[1:38:49.840 --> 1:38:53.600]  We won't come together, but you can look around. I've seen people from all walks of life today,
[1:38:53.600 --> 1:38:58.320]  different colors, different countries, different cities. So I'm just here to support that, but
[1:38:58.320 --> 1:39:01.440]  it's important to me because that's what I need to protect my life. If you take that away from me,
[1:39:01.440 --> 1:39:06.560]  what am I going to do? Look, there's enough of us that's willing to be here and I heard a report
[1:39:06.560 --> 1:39:10.880]  that's probably going to be close to 100,000 people throughout the entire day to show up here,
[1:39:10.880 --> 1:39:16.720]  to show their support for America. You know, this is beautiful. I love seeing this. Northam is trying
[1:39:16.720 --> 1:39:22.480]  to separate people. This is not a black issue. This is not a white issue. This is not Hispanic
[1:39:22.480 --> 1:39:28.160]  or Asian. This is an American issue. And at the end of the day, Martin Luther King stood for Americans.
[1:39:28.160 --> 1:39:32.960]  His pitch was if there's discord anywhere, if there's injustice anywhere, there's
[1:39:32.960 --> 1:39:38.800]  unjust as everywhere. You can't have something like this where Northam believes there's something
[1:39:38.800 --> 1:39:44.240]  about to happen, and he is going to roll down the Second Amendment. You have families, fathers,
[1:39:44.240 --> 1:39:48.480]  mothers who believe not just in the Second Amendment, they believe in all of it. The First
[1:39:48.480 --> 1:39:53.760]  Amendment, the Fourth Amendment, the Fifth Amendment, all of it. The Tenth Amendment specifically says
[1:39:53.760 --> 1:39:58.240]  that government can't do this. There are certain things that belong to the people. Northam believes
[1:39:58.240 --> 1:40:01.360]  that he can suspend it, and these people are here to tell him he can't do that.
[1:40:01.360 --> 1:40:05.680]  What they say about us is completely, it's a fallacy. It's not true.
[1:40:07.920 --> 1:40:13.600]  It's just a method of them to kind of just brainwash the public that's not necessarily
[1:40:14.240 --> 1:40:18.880]  on board with us or just kind of neutral to kind of get them on their side.
[1:40:18.880 --> 1:40:24.400]  Well, you know, they had to ratify it a long time ago because of us in 1966 when we were
[1:40:24.400 --> 1:40:28.960]  trying to protect ourselves a long time ago. So it's part of history for us.
[1:40:28.960 --> 1:40:33.280]  If you go back into history, gun control starts here in Virginia. It's a very racist place,
[1:40:33.280 --> 1:40:37.440]  and this is where I was basically raised. This is where I'm from. So, I mean, if you're trying to
[1:40:37.440 --> 1:40:42.320]  take anything away from me that I need to protect myself, I think that's a no-go. And I also don't
[1:40:42.320 --> 1:40:46.720]  agree with some of the things going on with this black-faced Northam guy. The Second Amendment
[1:40:46.720 --> 1:40:52.800]  is black history. The first gun restrictions were in place right here in Virginia in the 1600s.
[1:40:52.800 --> 1:40:57.360]  Then after that, we had slave codes right after the Civil War. And then after that,
[1:40:57.360 --> 1:41:02.320]  we had Jim Crow. And then we had the Mulford Act. So literally, this country has always been stripping
[1:41:02.320 --> 1:41:06.320]  away black people from being able to defend themselves and liberate themselves. So that's
[1:41:06.320 --> 1:41:10.400]  why it's important to me. I'm trying to carry on the ancestors or carry on the tradition that my
[1:41:10.400 --> 1:41:15.920]  ancestors did before me. What do you think about Governor Ralph Northam, how he had that controversy
[1:41:15.920 --> 1:41:21.280]  with blackface? We were here. We came here. Yeah, we came here to protest that too. Absolutely. We
[1:41:21.280 --> 1:41:27.280]  came here to protest that too. It's despicable. You know, I know he says it was a long time ago
[1:41:27.280 --> 1:41:34.640]  and it was Halloween costumes or whatever it was. But all in all, you know, we know. That just shows
[1:41:34.640 --> 1:41:40.080]  who he is. His wife did something very similar when she handed out cotton to little black kids at
[1:41:40.080 --> 1:41:46.240]  the governor's mansion and asked them to reflect on slavery. So there's just a racist family in
[1:41:46.240 --> 1:41:50.640]  general. He should have been removed when that whole incident went down. He didn't because we're
[1:41:50.640 --> 1:41:58.400]  such a blue state. But as far as history goes, he's also killing innocent babies that have already
[1:41:58.400 --> 1:42:04.720]  been born. So if you're pro-abortion, which disproportionately affects black people, you're
[1:42:04.720 --> 1:42:10.480]  taking black people's guns. This looks like we're going back in time to me. So yeah, I just, I don't
[1:42:10.480 --> 1:42:15.520]  think he should be in office at all. This is the governor now, who with the attorney general was
[1:42:15.520 --> 1:42:20.960]  rolling around in blackface. This is the government where the lieutenant government was
[1:42:20.960 --> 1:42:24.800]  rolling around in scandal. Whatever that case may, you know, whatever's happening there,
[1:42:24.800 --> 1:42:29.760]  there was a state of emergency, right? The government was in turmoil. We have to get back
[1:42:29.760 --> 1:42:34.960]  to issues that matter. What the people here are saying, when we're talking about our homes,
[1:42:34.960 --> 1:42:38.880]  our families, our children, we're also talking about our rights to defend ourselves.
[1:42:38.880 --> 1:42:44.320]  Wow. And the second very powerful report is about three minutes left of it. It's a Band-Aid video.
[1:42:44.320 --> 1:42:49.120]  We come back. We're going to look at the ongoing actions of Northam, because he just struck back.
[1:42:49.120 --> 1:42:53.680]  We'll break it down on the other side. Band.video. Band.video.
[1:42:55.680 --> 1:43:01.600]  infoorstore.com. We have a new product, and we got several thousand of these in, and they're going
[1:43:01.600 --> 1:43:05.200]  to sell out in a few days at the rate we're selling them. I want to thank the listeners for
[1:43:05.200 --> 1:43:11.680]  getting it, but this really is a game-changing toothpaste. And it doesn't compete with super
[1:43:11.680 --> 1:43:16.240]  blue. That's four to five of colloidal silver and iodine and fluoride-free, the adult or the
[1:43:16.240 --> 1:43:21.040]  children's. These are both excellent toothpaste, concentrates that don't have fillers. People
[1:43:21.040 --> 1:43:27.360]  love it. This is a whitening toothpaste that also has the above sea coral calcium that also cleans,
[1:43:27.360 --> 1:43:34.160]  but also re-mineralizes the teeth. Then it has the patented silver salt, silver in it to knock
[1:43:34.160 --> 1:43:38.240]  out the bacteria that causes ginsivitis. This is all proven. You can make claims with this,
[1:43:38.240 --> 1:43:43.600]  but I have to tell you, no one has a toothpaste this good for knocking out the bacteria, the
[1:43:43.600 --> 1:43:49.920]  viruses, and cleaning the teeth in a healthy way that doesn't strip away the enamel. So
[1:43:49.920 --> 1:43:54.560]  we're really proud of it. It funds the operation infoorstore.com. That's why we're still on air,
[1:43:54.560 --> 1:44:04.320]  thanks to you. Hey, you there. We have a problem. You see, there is a baby. The mother of this baby
[1:44:04.320 --> 1:44:11.520]  is not sure she's ready. The father of this baby doesn't want to settle down. The mother
[1:44:11.520 --> 1:44:19.760]  starts to have regrets. The father considers leaving town, but a friend says there's a solution.
[1:44:20.560 --> 1:44:28.720]  She says to have an abortion. The mother decides to look into it. The clinic assures her it's safe.
[1:44:28.720 --> 1:44:37.360]  She's made her decision. She's going to have an abortion. The problem is that baby is you.
[1:44:58.720 --> 1:45:04.640]  Breakthrough in Modern Medicine. Introducing pollen block. We have found an extraordinary new
[1:45:04.640 --> 1:45:09.840]  natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms, including promoting clear nasal
[1:45:09.840 --> 1:45:17.280]  and sinus passageways, eye comfort, and respiratory function. In the 1960s, researchers in France
[1:45:17.280 --> 1:45:22.640]  noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs experienced less seasonal immune and inflammatory
[1:45:22.640 --> 1:45:27.600]  responses. They began studying this effect in published trials, and decades later,
[1:45:27.600 --> 1:45:32.880]  we now have the fruit of this research, a fast-acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate
[1:45:32.880 --> 1:45:39.520]  seasonal distress symptoms. Pollen block is natural and effective. It is not an antihistamine. In fact,
[1:45:39.520 --> 1:45:44.000]  current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of tryptase,
[1:45:44.000 --> 1:45:49.040]  which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.
[1:45:49.040 --> 1:45:55.120]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe. Head to InfowarsLife.com and grab a pack of our pollen
[1:45:55.120 --> 1:46:01.120]  block chewable tablets. It's time to take a new healthier approach to one of your most basic needs.

[1:47:16.400 --> 1:47:31.680]  Well, it's now official. French government admits there are hundreds and hundreds of no-go zones
[1:47:33.280 --> 1:47:37.200]  in which French cannot go. You could be black, you could be white, you could be old, you could be
[1:47:37.200 --> 1:47:42.720]  young. If you're not a Muslim, you're going to get your ass attacked. And if you're an American
[1:47:42.720 --> 1:47:47.360]  rapper and you fight back in France or Sweden, they're going to lock your ass up till President
[1:47:47.360 --> 1:47:52.960]  Trump gets you out of jail. Imagine a bunch of big black dudes are walking down the street and a
[1:47:52.960 --> 1:47:59.040]  bunch of little Islamics come up and literally start attacking them. Black guys fight back,
[1:47:59.040 --> 1:48:04.480]  they're Americans, and they go to jail. That's how Europe has rolled out the red carpet of
[1:48:04.480 --> 1:48:09.920]  Islamics. And I have a big stack of news on that front. It's crazy. More throwing old people out
[1:48:09.920 --> 1:48:15.920]  of their houses to give it to Muslims. I was against the wars to stir up the Muslims and
[1:48:15.920 --> 1:48:21.760]  invade the Middle East. But then I saw the later part of the plan flooding Europe.
[1:48:23.840 --> 1:48:28.160]  Once they had taught the Muslims to hate us even more and making Europe bow down and submit to
[1:48:28.160 --> 1:48:35.120]  Islam, it's a master plan. And it's admitted, the UN has an admitted plan. And this is how
[1:48:35.120 --> 1:48:44.320]  modern warfare is fought. And I had Muslims repeatedly come up and tell me when I was in
[1:48:44.320 --> 1:48:50.480]  DC, listen, we're going to conquer you just like we've conquered Paris.
[1:48:54.560 --> 1:48:57.760]  And you're going to submit or you're going to be driven into the hills.
[1:48:57.760 --> 1:49:12.160]  And I'm going to get to this later, but it's a long story. But I had a group of Muslims covertly
[1:49:12.160 --> 1:49:16.800]  messing with my wife when I took her on the trip with me. So they didn't mess with me.
[1:49:17.600 --> 1:49:22.960]  They would mess with her. And I didn't think she was crazy. But I was like, really? And then I caught
[1:49:22.960 --> 1:49:28.560]  one of them doing it in the hotel. Coming up saying mean things that act like nothing happened,
[1:49:28.560 --> 1:49:32.800]  gaslighting. It's just incredible because they know how to not go frontal up against the man.
[1:49:32.800 --> 1:49:38.960]  They mess with your woman. It's just, it's just, it's disgusting. What it is. And I'm not going
[1:49:38.960 --> 1:49:43.120]  to live under that type of crap. I can just tell you. Are there good people in those countries?
[1:49:43.120 --> 1:49:48.960]  Yes. Do I want to kill them all? No. Will I submit to them? Absolutely not. Islam means
[1:49:48.960 --> 1:49:54.400]  submission and it ain't happening. You got it? Only person I'm getting on my knees to is Jesus
[1:49:54.400 --> 1:49:59.760]  Christ. And that's the son of God. I'll submit to Christ all day long. I'm submitting to you
[1:49:59.760 --> 1:50:04.880]  over my dead body. And I'm sure you'll try to arrange it. But not before I've rallied the people.
[1:50:09.760 --> 1:50:12.560]  There are a lot of people in those countries that want to live in freedom.
[1:50:12.560 --> 1:50:21.920]  And Islam needs a reformation. Because what it really is, is a criminal political system.
[1:50:23.120 --> 1:50:27.520]  What we need is real Christianity. That is the answer to unify humanity together.
[1:50:28.080 --> 1:50:35.360]  And Christianity is tolerant of other groups. Islam is not. But by making it the world religion,
[1:50:35.360 --> 1:50:38.640]  everyone then must submit to it. And that's what the globalists have chosen.
[1:50:38.640 --> 1:50:46.560]  And the anti-crisis is going to try to enforce in the future a weird globalist, secularist system.
[1:50:47.120 --> 1:50:51.920]  But that is allied with Islam, where it will be able to persecute whoever it wants.
[1:50:53.520 --> 1:50:56.880]  And that you'll have to bow to it and to the beast at the same time.
[1:50:58.000 --> 1:51:02.480]  Everything with Satan is a fraud and a contradiction. And you can see the whole thing
[1:51:02.480 --> 1:51:09.040]  coming clearly, clearly into view. And the beast at the whore rides.
[1:51:10.000 --> 1:51:13.200]  And that's why the Vatican is now converting to Islam in the final move.
[1:51:13.920 --> 1:51:18.800]  And Catholics are rejecting it. Because it's no longer Catholicism that is in Rome.
[1:51:19.680 --> 1:51:24.640]  It is 100% a satanic religion. Captured by the devil himself.
[1:51:24.640 --> 1:51:29.600]  God help us. God help us.
[1:51:32.560 --> 1:51:37.120]  The Pope says, open the gates of Europe, flood everything. He says he becomes nauseous last year.
[1:51:37.680 --> 1:51:46.560]  He goes, I become sick to my stomach when I hear about Europe's Christian roots.
[1:51:46.560 --> 1:51:50.640]  And how we should keep Europe Christian. The supposed head of Christ in them,
[1:51:50.640 --> 1:51:56.160]  the defender of the faith. You say what you want about Pope's seven problems in the past,
[1:51:56.160 --> 1:52:01.600]  but they sent millions to war. And so to the Orthodox church to stop Europe from being overrun
[1:52:01.600 --> 1:52:06.240]  by Islam. And now he says, bring them in. And I don't want to hear about Christianity.
[1:52:09.040 --> 1:52:15.120]  Big fat devil. That's all I see. Big old pedo manager. I don't know if he has sex with kids,
[1:52:15.120 --> 1:52:21.440]  but I sure as hell know he protects it. Got a big problem. Okay, I said I'd get to all this
[1:52:21.440 --> 1:52:28.240]  other news and I haven't because I'm just angry right now. Absolutely angry.
[1:52:30.560 --> 1:52:33.680]  And there's just too many angles. There's just too much news. There's just too much to cover.
[1:52:33.680 --> 1:52:38.080]  I don't even know how you hit it all. But let me just, let me do this. Let me just finish up with
[1:52:38.080 --> 1:52:45.920]  the gun stuff and I'll get to everything else. The Virginia governor said there was going to be
[1:52:45.920 --> 1:52:51.520]  a big civil war and death and all this crap. We said they were going to say that before he said it.
[1:52:51.520 --> 1:52:56.560]  And they were planning something bigger than Dallas. That city of northeast Texas.
[1:52:58.320 --> 1:53:04.160]  But instead it was I estimated 30,000. But then the police said tens of thousands came and go.
[1:53:04.160 --> 1:53:10.240]  It might have been as much as 60,000. But you know, as I estimated 30,000 at about 11 a.m.,
[1:53:10.240 --> 1:53:14.400]  the police later said they estimated 30,000 as well. Just saying. Info wars,
[1:53:14.400 --> 1:53:18.800]  excuse of exaggerating. No, I really go with what I think is accurate and most of the time it's right.
[1:53:20.800 --> 1:53:28.240]  Virginia's massive program rally draws big crowds, big weapons, and Alex Jones in a big armored vehicle.
[1:53:28.240 --> 1:53:35.280]  Continuing. Incredibly, no one got shot.
[1:53:37.360 --> 1:53:39.520]  No one shot themselves in Virginia rally. Vice.
[1:53:41.600 --> 1:53:45.120]  Our militia's activist Alex Jones converted John Richmond pro-gun rally.
[1:53:47.280 --> 1:53:49.360]  Alex Jones cruises the streets in battle tank.
[1:53:51.920 --> 1:53:55.920]  Now, what's going on with that? Well, this is the new article.
[1:53:55.920 --> 1:54:03.040]  National file dot com. Virginia Senate Democrats ignore massive gun rights rally, advance red
[1:54:03.040 --> 1:54:08.400]  flag legislation. It goes through that it's passed through the committees. They have the votes to
[1:54:08.400 --> 1:54:14.160]  preemptively without due process with no evidence you're planning anything. Take your guns and kill
[1:54:14.160 --> 1:54:18.480]  you if you resist. And they've got laws almost passed to take all semi autos. I've already read
[1:54:18.480 --> 1:54:23.760]  the laws on air. And notice Northam was just saying two weeks ago, oh, they're not going to pass.
[1:54:23.760 --> 1:54:27.520]  Don't worry. We just want better background checks. And of course now they're passing through.
[1:54:27.520 --> 1:54:32.080]  So they always tell you it's not happening so you don't resist politically. So it goes through.
[1:54:32.880 --> 1:54:34.160]  Oh, nobody wants your guns.
[1:54:36.400 --> 1:54:43.200]  And again, 80% of the capital grounds were cut off so that they could sandwich everyone in
[1:54:44.000 --> 1:54:49.840]  at least 20,000 that got in and I got out of there. I had my crew there, my security.
[1:54:49.840 --> 1:54:52.880]  And I said, the way this is filling up, we're already shoulder to shoulder.
[1:54:52.880 --> 1:54:56.400]  I said, another 30 minutes, this is going to be dangerous. And I said, if they stage some
[1:54:56.400 --> 1:55:01.680]  stampede, I don't want to be here. So we got outside of the containment area and it was just
[1:55:01.680 --> 1:55:05.600]  every street and every angle was just tens of thousands of people like 5,000 down the street,
[1:55:05.600 --> 1:55:09.280]  10,000 down the street, thousands down the street, thousands everywhere. I mean, it was,
[1:55:09.280 --> 1:55:14.880]  it was 50,000 people at one point. And that's what then blocking all the parking garages and
[1:55:14.880 --> 1:55:19.680]  everything so people couldn't get there and talk about a time bomb. If anybody would have fallen
[1:55:19.680 --> 1:55:27.840]  down or there'd been a backfire of a car or anything, but it didn't happen. Ladies and gentlemen,
[1:55:29.360 --> 1:55:33.440]  it didn't happen. Now, most of the videos I shot was out at the edges of the crowds because you
[1:55:33.440 --> 1:55:36.640]  can't get in the middle of a crowd and bullhorn. That could be dangerous and cause a stampede.
[1:55:36.640 --> 1:55:39.680]  So I didn't do that as well. Like at one point, the crowds were coming towards me.
[1:55:40.240 --> 1:55:44.160]  State police said, Hey, can you get outside the crowds? It doesn't, you're on my absolutely.
[1:55:44.160 --> 1:55:46.560]  That wasn't a police state violate my speech. They were like, ah,
[1:55:46.560 --> 1:55:51.280]  ah, now the crowds are leaving. Can you go over there? Because it could cause an issue.
[1:55:51.280 --> 1:55:56.640]  But thank God nothing did. And the problem is the governor is now coming for your guns.
[1:55:57.200 --> 1:56:02.320]  And it's real tyranny and massive election fraud. And so let's pray for Virginia because
[1:56:03.040 --> 1:56:07.040]  what's happened to Virginia's happened into Texas. We're inches away from where they're at.
[1:56:07.040 --> 1:56:10.560]  We're very close to where California is. And everybody thinks, Oh, Virginia is safe.
[1:56:10.560 --> 1:56:16.160]  Oh, Texas is safe. No, it's not. Just because you've had freedom because you're great, great,
[1:56:16.160 --> 1:56:19.040]  great, great granddad. He fought for it doesn't mean it's still going to be there
[1:56:19.040 --> 1:56:23.760]  because they're flooding the states with illegal aliens that are voting. And again,
[1:56:23.760 --> 1:56:29.440]  I don't hate the illegal aliens. In fact, we always can use more workers and more brains,
[1:56:29.440 --> 1:56:33.520]  as long as they weren't brainwashed to vote against the second amendment vote Democrat,
[1:56:33.520 --> 1:56:37.040]  because they are and they're voting illegally. They got to be kept from getting in
[1:56:37.680 --> 1:56:41.200]  because they're being used as a weapon. And I'm not going to sit here and take it.
[1:56:41.920 --> 1:56:45.840]  So you come here legally and you're producing. We need to compete with China and India.
[1:56:45.840 --> 1:56:49.840]  If you adopt our values, great, but they're not adopting our values because the Democrats
[1:56:49.840 --> 1:56:53.280]  have it set up to put them on welfare and brainwash them. So until that's fixed,
[1:56:53.280 --> 1:56:58.320]  I want a moratorium on immigration. Ladies and gentlemen, a moratorium until it's fixed. All
[1:56:58.320 --> 1:57:03.840]  right, I'm going to go to break didn't plug once this hour. We're not bringing in really any money
[1:57:03.840 --> 1:57:08.080]  right now. We got two big sales running. I really need you to support us and get products you already
[1:57:08.080 --> 1:57:12.000]  needed to total win wins. So just take action. You see him for his bus in our butts and we'll do
[1:57:12.000 --> 1:57:16.080]  such a better job to keep us in the game. Fish oil sales about the end ultimate fish oil because
[1:57:16.080 --> 1:57:20.080]  we'll run out two weeks. If I don't take it off sale about a week, take advantage of that. It's
[1:57:20.080 --> 1:57:23.520]  amazing. Don't have time to give the benefits of it. We've got the best out there. There might be
[1:57:23.520 --> 1:57:28.480]  something as good, but from our research, it's it's it's really good info or store.com on that
[1:57:28.480 --> 1:57:33.840]  33% off an X two sold out. It's back in the ultimate good halogen to counter the bad halogen
[1:57:33.840 --> 1:57:38.000]  fluoride. So good for every man, woman and child in America. You don't have X two. You're crazy.
[1:57:38.000 --> 1:57:42.880]  If you don't get it, this does great work for your body and it funds the operation 40% off right
[1:57:42.880 --> 1:57:48.960]  now in info or store. I've got to really hand it to the listeners and viewers who enforce
[1:57:49.840 --> 1:57:56.240]  your support and your help in rebooting Americana as a challenge to the globalist system of corporate
[1:57:56.240 --> 1:58:01.840]  tyranny has really caught hold, not just here in the U. S. Worldwide and President Trump's
[1:58:01.840 --> 1:58:08.160]  fearlessness when it comes to promoting Americana and basic liberty is amazing as well. He's still
[1:58:08.160 --> 1:58:13.680]  lacking on the big tech censorship, taking action against that in some other areas, but tried to
[1:58:13.680 --> 1:58:18.160]  end the wars, boosting our economy, speaking out against communist China. Trump's been doing an
[1:58:18.160 --> 1:58:24.480]  amazing job, but now more than ever, we really have to realize that we're being targeted because
[1:58:24.480 --> 1:58:31.120]  we are effective and the globalists are beginning to lose their war against humanity in a big way.
[1:58:31.120 --> 1:58:35.680]  And so we're going to see some major fireworks out of them, but it's critical to not let ourselves
[1:58:35.680 --> 1:58:41.280]  get down when we see all the poison they spray at us. That's an attempt to demoralize us.
[1:58:41.280 --> 1:58:44.480]  We've got to remember that and stay focused and stay happy.

[2:00:02.080 --> 2:00:08.720]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones coming to you live from the
[2:00:08.720 --> 2:00:16.400]  front lines of the info war. I said I was going to take calls today, but I've got behind on the news
[2:00:16.400 --> 2:00:22.960]  here because there's a lot of breaking news and there's also Trump and Greta Thunberg is very
[2:00:22.960 --> 2:00:28.080]  illustrative. There's also the latest on the virus. They're hyping up. Is it really this
[2:00:28.080 --> 2:00:33.680]  mega deadly threat? I think it is a pretty big threat. There's a lot of creepy stuff going on
[2:00:33.680 --> 2:00:41.280]  in the background with that. Also, I mentioned this French Intel agency does 150 neighborhoods
[2:00:41.280 --> 2:00:48.400]  held by radical Islamists. Close quote. That's all coming up. And then there's really a big story
[2:00:49.760 --> 2:00:56.960]  that was aired on Tucker Carlson last Friday, but because I was in DC, I didn't cover it.
[2:00:56.960 --> 2:01:04.000]  And so I think I'm going to cover that after I cover the Greta Thunberg Trump news in the next
[2:01:04.000 --> 2:01:09.680]  segment because it's going to take at least a segment to get into. It's a really big deal
[2:01:10.800 --> 2:01:17.520]  because if you want to take Trump the woodshed on something, that's it. See, I don't want to take
[2:01:17.520 --> 2:01:23.760]  Trump the woodshed to like appease people that don't like Trump. They don't like him because
[2:01:23.760 --> 2:01:28.240]  he's an office period and he's a nationalist and a patriot and means well and is trying to be the
[2:01:28.240 --> 2:01:34.240]  president when they want public presidents. But when it comes to him trying to get jobs here,
[2:01:34.240 --> 2:01:42.000]  jobs aren't any good if we're all dying of cancer. So I said I'd get to it in a little while, but
[2:01:43.760 --> 2:01:49.120]  I'm going to get to it because everybody was running up to me in DC and then when I was in
[2:01:49.120 --> 2:01:54.320]  Virginia saying, oh, the gay frogs, Tucker Carlson says you're right about gay frogs and I'm just
[2:01:54.320 --> 2:02:01.920]  like, guys, the genius of the globalist is they're able to take something very deadly serious
[2:02:04.960 --> 2:02:10.960]  and turn it into a joke. People say, yeah, and you're the one that went along with it. Well,
[2:02:10.960 --> 2:02:16.800]  that was like 10 years ago. I've learned a lot. I mean, I wasn't making a joke when I said I don't
[2:02:16.800 --> 2:02:21.280]  like him putting chemicals in the water that turned the frogs game. But I laughed at it for a while
[2:02:22.400 --> 2:02:26.480]  until I realized what they're getting us all the laugh at something that's destroying the earth
[2:02:27.440 --> 2:02:34.480]  and hurting us really, really bad. So that's why I joke around a lot less here on here.
[2:02:35.120 --> 2:02:37.520]  And I'm not as happy a person because I like to have fun.
[2:02:41.680 --> 2:02:44.560]  But you know, there's no perfect way to stop this. We just got to take action.
[2:02:44.560 --> 2:02:50.320]  But there's a lot of chemicals that can be used in industry that aren't even the same class as bad
[2:02:50.320 --> 2:03:00.320]  as Atrazine. And the fact that Trump has loosened up restrictions on Atrazine when they had been
[2:03:00.320 --> 2:03:06.640]  cracked down on, he just saw everything the Democrats were restricting as something to
[2:03:06.640 --> 2:03:10.560]  shut down America like clean burning coal and show me other things. And that's true.
[2:03:10.560 --> 2:03:17.840]  But Atrazine is not one of them. We need a global convention on things like Atrazine.
[2:03:18.560 --> 2:03:27.280]  Because the smallest amount of Atrazine will absolutely ruin your or your children's lives.
[2:03:29.520 --> 2:03:32.240]  And I'm not going to go into all the side effects and stuff today, but
[2:03:34.320 --> 2:03:38.320]  people seem to care about vain things. It doesn't matter if you're black, Hispanic,
[2:03:38.320 --> 2:03:43.280]  white or old. In the last 70 years or so with Atrazine in the water, the genitals,
[2:03:43.280 --> 2:03:49.920]  this is a uterine deformity that happens in uterus during development of the fetus,
[2:03:51.680 --> 2:03:55.920]  where males slowly are having their genitals waste away until soon.
[2:03:57.920 --> 2:04:02.240]  Men are going to have genitals the size of a woman's clitoris in about two generations
[2:04:02.240 --> 2:04:06.240]  with current Atrazine levels. So if you like your sons not having a cock,
[2:04:06.240 --> 2:04:11.360]  then you're going to love Atrazine. So you notice the globalists are obsessed with chopping
[2:04:11.360 --> 2:04:15.520]  your sons Wayvo's offer, getting to sign on to doing it. And again, we can joke about it all
[2:04:15.520 --> 2:04:22.240]  day long. And I have, it's not funny. It's a vicious matter of the globalists hitting us
[2:04:22.240 --> 2:04:29.360]  chemically to attack and take out the species. So that's what this is. And look,
[2:04:29.360 --> 2:04:32.800]  tribbles up men's genitals, screws them up for life. What's it to do to women?
[2:04:32.800 --> 2:04:38.880]  Well, it breast cancer and a whole bunch of other stuff in fries, the uterus in utero,
[2:04:38.880 --> 2:04:42.800]  where these girls are going to be sterile and screwed up for life. I mean, this is a weapon.
[2:04:43.360 --> 2:04:51.520]  Atrazine is a chemical weapon, chemical weapon pulled apart at van dot video. Only way it gets
[2:04:51.520 --> 2:05:01.760]  down is you. It is I, the leader of Cobra here for a message to President Trump, the American people,
[2:05:01.760 --> 2:05:08.720]  and Alex Jones of info wars. Our operation for our partners, the Communist Chinese have
[2:05:08.720 --> 2:05:17.040]  bought control of your media. But it's true, your people are beginning to awaken. That's why
[2:05:17.040 --> 2:05:24.560]  Cobra is launching operations to trigger race war, mashings and bombings, which will be blamed on
[2:05:24.560 --> 2:05:31.920]  those loyal to America. Anyone once we stage these attacks, that does not blame it on Trump,
[2:05:31.920 --> 2:05:41.280]  will also be targeted by Cobra in the future. You see, when you expose our false flags and fake
[2:05:41.280 --> 2:05:49.440]  media, I will carry out attacks and then blame you like we've done with Alex Jones blaming him
[2:05:49.440 --> 2:05:55.440]  for mass shootings we committed. Hey, oh, come on.
[2:05:55.440 --> 2:06:11.440]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation. It's Alex Jones.
[2:06:25.600 --> 2:06:30.960]  But only the third time in history, a US president is on trial,
[2:06:30.960 --> 2:06:36.080]  did officially kick off. There's a few hours ago after days of wrangling by the deep state
[2:06:36.080 --> 2:06:40.560]  Democrats as they attempted to see the American people. And now we're going to be treated to two
[2:06:40.560 --> 2:06:47.680]  days of Adam Schiff lying his ass off. Every time we just tune in for 20 seconds, it's a new
[2:06:47.680 --> 2:06:55.840]  whopper lie with no evidence on par with saying prostitutes were in a Russian hotel pissing all
[2:06:55.840 --> 2:07:03.120]  over. Then billionaire businessman Donald Trump. I mean, it's just flagrant horsemaner.
[2:07:05.920 --> 2:07:11.280]  And it's the death rows of that political party if they're unable to trigger a civil race war in
[2:07:11.280 --> 2:07:16.080]  this country. He's up there still right now. Here, let's fade him up and see what he's saying now.
[2:07:16.080 --> 2:07:27.040]  For the very, very next day, he's on the phone 24th. Special counsel Mueller testifies
[2:07:28.000 --> 2:07:32.720]  that Russia interfered in our 2016 election to assist the Trump campaign,
[2:07:33.840 --> 2:07:39.280]  knew about the interference, welcomed it, and utilized it. That's the 24th. The 25th is the
[2:07:39.280 --> 2:07:46.800]  day of the call when President Trump, believing he'd escaped accountability for Russian meddling
[2:07:46.800 --> 2:07:52.240]  in the first election and is welcoming of it, asked the Ukrainian president to help him undermine
[2:07:52.240 --> 2:07:57.520]  the special counsel's conclusion and help him smear a political opponent, former vice president
[2:07:57.520 --> 2:08:04.400]  Biden. And then the third day in a row in July, President Trump sought to ensure that Ukraine
[2:08:04.400 --> 2:08:10.640]  had received her request. Oh my gosh. So no one's going to watch this, obviously, and the media
[2:08:10.640 --> 2:08:16.640]  that carries it is going to drive the ratings down from super low to absolute rock bottom.
[2:08:18.160 --> 2:08:22.240]  And then I guess they're betting that it'll be so boring that by the time the Republicans finally
[2:08:22.240 --> 2:08:27.840]  get a defense, didn't get one in the house, haven't got one the last couple months in the ongoing
[2:08:27.840 --> 2:08:37.760]  wrangling, will finally get a defense for two days. So this just got started later today,
[2:08:37.760 --> 2:08:44.400]  because that's only partial day. So I guess they're going to go until
[2:08:48.080 --> 2:08:55.280]  sometime early Friday. And then the Republicans, I guess, will start their defense Friday
[2:08:55.280 --> 2:09:00.240]  and then have it on Monday and part of Tuesday. Then the Senate will start asking questions a few
[2:09:00.240 --> 2:09:06.320]  days and deliberate. Looks like next Friday. And guess what Pelosi says? They got more articles
[2:09:06.320 --> 2:09:13.360]  they're going to pass. And just keep doing it.
[2:09:16.000 --> 2:09:20.000]  Where it's just this ongoing process to sabotage the operation of the government.
[2:09:20.000 --> 2:09:28.560]  And the Communist Chinese are all openly funding Hollywood and the whole thing.
[2:09:29.120 --> 2:09:33.120]  And I want to explain something. The globalists went and set up China so they can launder money
[2:09:33.120 --> 2:09:36.960]  and not have the environmental rules and shut us down. I mean, we know that. So when I say
[2:09:36.960 --> 2:09:43.120]  the chai comms, the globalist chai comm, disgusting partnership. And of course, the chai comms in
[2:09:43.120 --> 2:09:48.400]  the middle of Obama administration had such disrespect for the deep state that they double
[2:09:48.400 --> 2:09:55.200]  crossed Obama and Hillary in the New World Order. So we had to pivot from feeding our troops and
[2:09:55.200 --> 2:10:00.480]  money into that desert in the Middle East and Central Asia to run over and try to get the
[2:10:00.480 --> 2:10:09.120]  chai comms back in line. And that's when the wheels started coming off on the Islamic invasion
[2:10:09.120 --> 2:10:15.840]  and the takedown and all of it. And even big central elites and institutional organizations
[2:10:15.840 --> 2:10:21.040]  said, look, we went along with this world government project to stop war, we were told,
[2:10:21.040 --> 2:10:27.280]  in the 50s. All this is doing is obsessing over chopping our son's testicles off
[2:10:27.280 --> 2:10:32.320]  and teaching people how to devil worship and how to get rid of a world of men and women
[2:10:32.320 --> 2:10:38.560]  and a post human, post industrial world with the big tech people ruling over us in AI.
[2:10:38.560 --> 2:10:41.040]  That doesn't sound like a good future, does it?
[2:10:41.040 --> 2:10:48.080]  Oh, but you'll live forever. You just got to give up your humanity to the big tech system.
[2:10:48.720 --> 2:10:51.680]  And so a lot of the globalists are like, we don't want to be globalists anymore.
[2:10:52.720 --> 2:10:55.520]  You ever come up with that life extension stuff? You tell me about it.
[2:10:55.520 --> 2:10:57.840]  Sounds like a bunch of hocus pocus to me.
[2:11:01.520 --> 2:11:07.280]  Why should we just throw the whole American world system, human system down the toilet?
[2:11:07.280 --> 2:11:10.560]  And purposely dump everybody down so we can rule over them.
[2:11:10.560 --> 2:11:13.760]  That doesn't sound like something very powerful elites would do, does it?
[2:11:14.560 --> 2:11:20.800]  I mean, if I was a big powerful elitist and that I was elite, mentally, physically, spiritually,
[2:11:20.800 --> 2:11:26.720]  culturally, and I'd proven it, and I was in control, I wouldn't be trying to run people
[2:11:26.720 --> 2:11:30.880]  down and make them dumb so I could rule over them because I wouldn't need to.
[2:11:30.880 --> 2:11:35.280]  I'd want to empower them because I want my children and their children, their children,
[2:11:35.280 --> 2:11:40.480]  to grow up in a universe with better people because I metaphysically know that if I wiped
[2:11:40.480 --> 2:11:45.280]  out most of these people, I would all come back on my family and it would come back on me and I
[2:11:45.280 --> 2:11:50.320]  would never be allowed across the threshold into the next level and actually meet the creator
[2:11:50.320 --> 2:11:57.760]  face to face. But these people thrown it all away, ladies and gentlemen. So I said I'd get to the
[2:11:57.760 --> 2:12:02.640]  news and we come back and be very judicious and very focused. I'm going to hit the big water
[2:12:02.640 --> 2:12:09.440]  story with Tucker Carlson first, then I will hit Reddith Unberg and Trump countering that,
[2:12:09.440 --> 2:12:13.360]  and then I'll hit the Islamic invasion, big developments on that front. And then there's a
[2:12:13.360 --> 2:12:20.400]  bunch of other news here where Tulsi Gabbards has sued Hillary for defamation. Yeah, saying she's a
[2:12:20.400 --> 2:12:25.600]  Russian agent trying to destroy her life. I have experienced this and I'm not saying that as a victim,
[2:12:25.600 --> 2:12:31.280]  like oh, poor me, I just want action. Because you've all seen, and I haven't played half of them,
[2:12:31.280 --> 2:12:36.480]  the Congressional hearings in the House Armed Services Committee doesn't get any more powerful
[2:12:36.480 --> 2:12:46.320]  in the Senate Intelligence Committee, saying I work for the damn Russians. So it's very personal
[2:12:46.320 --> 2:12:51.280]  for me that Trump be vindicated and that we be vindicated because I'm not going to get my name
[2:12:51.280 --> 2:12:56.080]  court, but I've got this platform to defend myself because if they can take us down, they're
[2:12:56.080 --> 2:13:01.200]  going to slander all Americans. And that's really what I care about. I want to win because they
[2:13:01.200 --> 2:13:07.280]  want to beat you. They want to make you dumb and stupid and a slave and that pisses me off
[2:13:07.280 --> 2:13:12.960]  watching these bullies generation after generation, mutate humanity and enslave us so they can
[2:13:12.960 --> 2:13:19.680]  feel powerful and it makes me so angry. And I want to get them off our backs.
[2:13:19.680 --> 2:13:28.640]  I want to get them off our backs so bad, ladies and gentlemen, and I'm rooting for humanity. But
[2:13:28.640 --> 2:13:37.440]  the only way we can defeat them is if we release what they fear and they fear info wars. You know,
[2:13:38.320 --> 2:13:42.960]  I wasn't going to talk about this, but I might as well because really it's a message to the White
[2:13:42.960 --> 2:13:48.000]  House. You know, I've had the White House reach out through a lot of people last week and this
[2:13:48.000 --> 2:13:54.240]  week they could see how hard info wars is fighting. And because all the phones are tapped and all the
[2:13:54.240 --> 2:13:57.600]  rest of it when they opened up the criminal investigation of myself and stone, I've been
[2:13:57.600 --> 2:14:02.080]  under criminal investigation as a Russian as well. And a lot of stuff I can't talk about at this
[2:14:02.080 --> 2:14:06.240]  point, but I've talked to the FBI. I've been in to see the FBI. A lot of stuff's going on. Okay.
[2:14:06.880 --> 2:14:10.480]  And they obviously know I'm not a Russian and they understand what's happening. But
[2:14:10.480 --> 2:14:19.200]  I don't want, I don't need Trump to call me. I don't need Trump to have other journalists contact
[2:14:19.200 --> 2:14:22.640]  me so the president wanted to thank you and really appreciate you and appreciate what you're
[2:14:22.640 --> 2:14:27.360]  doing. I don't need to be patted on the head like I've told Trump when he calls me. I need action
[2:14:27.360 --> 2:14:32.320]  from the president. We've already seen bold action, but we need to get on the offensive
[2:14:32.320 --> 2:14:37.920]  and we need to indict the deep state. We need to indict big tech for racketeering and suppression
[2:14:37.920 --> 2:14:43.520]  and just every crime you can imagine. It's open and shut. We have to go after them. They're the
[2:14:43.520 --> 2:14:49.680]  authoritarians. They're the danger. Listen, I like President Trump, but I've already seen
[2:14:49.680 --> 2:14:53.520]  the top of Hollywood. I've seen the top of the U.S. government. I don't care about all that stuff,
[2:14:53.520 --> 2:14:57.920]  the pomp, the circumstance. I'm not looking for the pat on the head, Mr. President. I'm looking for
[2:14:57.920 --> 2:15:06.960]  action. That's all I'm asking for. And I know you're giving us action on so many fronts.
[2:15:06.960 --> 2:15:11.360]  I'm just simply telling you it's what the people want. It's what's right. It's what we need to see
[2:15:11.360 --> 2:15:17.760]  happen. But I know who can take action. And that's the listeners and the viewers of this broadcast.
[2:15:17.760 --> 2:15:22.400]  We are the voice in the heart and the soul, the spirit of Americana. The fusion of the
[2:15:22.400 --> 2:15:29.600]  Republic 1776 with real Christianity, not fake in your face Pharisees. Holier than now stuff.
[2:15:29.600 --> 2:15:34.080]  Just I love God. I want to take action. And I know you do too. Let's do it together.
[2:15:34.080 --> 2:15:39.280]  And that's why funding us and buying products info or short.com and sign up for auto ship
[2:15:39.280 --> 2:15:43.520]  to be able to, you know, recurring support us and get great profit. Same time. It's so critical
[2:15:43.520 --> 2:15:48.480]  to this. Everybody commit now. Step to the plate in the fight for freedom. We need a lot of money.
[2:15:48.480 --> 2:15:56.960]  We needed now to not just stay on air, but expand. We can all agree. These are troubled times, right?

[2:18:54.000 --> 2:19:10.000]  We have been fighting so hard in the last two weeks that I've not even had time to cut new audio ads for this huge syndicated radio audience. And I apologize to radio listeners, I apologize to the fact I'm cutting this on a phone as I drive around the road, but this is a war and we're getting it done anyway we can.
[2:19:10.000 --> 2:19:34.000]  But we had huge sales in the new year. Around Christmas end of the new year. But we sold the products at such low prices that it didn't bring in a lot of actual capital to fund our operations and I'm expending massive amounts of money to put more than 15 people in Virginia more than 10 people in BC all next week for the trial of Trump.
[2:19:34.000 --> 2:19:46.000]  It's so critical we're there to confront the globalist and put out the counter narrative of the truth to what they're doing. This is a real fight. So please step to the plate and take care of yourself and your family and get great products while you do it.

[2:20:36.000 --> 2:20:54.000]  HBO had a show on making fun of me for talking about Atrazine and the frogs becoming gay. I mean they try to have sex with their males. They don't have babies. They die. They die in South Africa. They die in Australia. They die in Europe. They die in Houston.
[2:20:54.000 --> 2:21:07.000]  There are reports where half the male frogs of one species were attracted to males and trying to fertilize them and they're not fertilizing the female eggs and they're dying. It's not funny.
[2:21:07.000 --> 2:21:21.000]  But David Hogg he comes out and says Jones is trying to stop this being in the water. We need more gay people and think about that. It's not attacking somebody because I don't hate people for their sexual proclivity of their adults.
[2:21:21.000 --> 2:21:37.000]  It's the targeting of the children. It's the whole sexualization. It's the chemicals that are hurting males, females, not just of our species, not just of the mammal kingdom, not just of Homo sapiens sapien.
[2:21:37.000 --> 2:21:55.000]  But across the board and they turn into a joke when I was covering this 20-something years ago when it was mainline reports. Hell, democracy now was covering this 20 years ago. It's not funny what they make it into a big joke.
[2:21:55.000 --> 2:22:09.000]  So Tucker Carlson last week had a big long piece on it. I'm just going to play a few minutes where he talked about Trump and Trump's EPA that most of the things Trump's done like seeing turned the coal power plants back on.
[2:22:09.000 --> 2:22:22.000]  That's great. Only water and carbon dioxide come out of those. Nobody else has to make cuts. China has all the dirty ones. So does India. We know that again 90% of the pollution comes out of those two countries alone.
[2:22:22.000 --> 2:22:47.000]  So why is the EPA going in and trying to weaken restrictions on atrazine when atrazine is on record causing massive cancer, destroying male fertility and manipulating across the board the brain tissue of males and females
[2:22:47.000 --> 2:23:11.000]  and manipulating humans at the endric and level. And so it has all sorts of effects, feminizing men. And how it works is when men are fed female chemicals or chemicals that mimic that, it does in some men trigger an attraction to the same sex.
[2:23:11.000 --> 2:23:24.000]  Berkeley News. Pesticide atrazine can turn male frogs into females. So you see the whole trans movement, the genitals physically on Western males, you can be black, you can be white, you can be Asian, are getting smaller.
[2:23:24.000 --> 2:23:39.000]  The testicles are getting smaller. The sperm counts are way lower. It's killing us. The side effect is smaller genitals. People make jokes about it. You're being killed, ladies and gentlemen.
[2:23:39.000 --> 2:23:47.000]  And even the smallest amounts of it will irrevocably mess somebody up. So here's what Tucker Carlson had to say about it.
[2:23:47.000 --> 2:23:58.000]  Despite its name the Environmental Protection Agency doesn't just exist to protect the environment. It also exists to protect you by policing against the many pollutants that are generated by modern life.
[2:23:58.000 --> 2:24:12.000]  But soon the EPA will be doing a little bit less to protect you and a little bit more to protect big agriculture. Atrazine is a pesticide. It's the second most common one in the United States. Half of America's corn crop is treated with it.
[2:24:12.000 --> 2:24:23.000]  Atrazine is banned in the European Union and here's why. When administered to male frogs, atrazine chemically castrates them and even causes some to change their sex entirely.
[2:24:23.000 --> 2:24:38.000]  In humans, atrazine is an endocrine disruptor. That means it causes changes to your natural hormonal balance. For newborn boys, atrazine exposure in utero is correlated with lower birth weight, undescended testicles, and deformities to sex organs.
[2:24:38.000 --> 2:24:48.000]  Now it may be that atrazine's risk is low enough and its value is high enough that we don't need to ban it. But the EPA isn't just keeping atrazine legal.
[2:24:48.000 --> 2:25:03.000]  It's decided to stop closely monitoring its use. Buried within a recent 60-page regulatory document, the EPA has announced it will soon end its atrazine monitoring program, which tests drinking water to make certain that atrazine levels are safe.
[2:25:03.000 --> 2:25:16.000]  According to the EPA, the risk is simply so low that it's not worth even checking to make sure the situation is under control. In fact, it's so low they're allowing 50% more atrazine to enter America's waterways.
[2:25:16.000 --> 2:25:26.000]  Now that's despite the fact that in 2017, year where the most recent data are public, 30 million Americans had measurable amounts of atrazine in their tap water.
[2:25:26.000 --> 2:25:37.000]  Now according to researchers at Purdue University, a single part per billion of atrazine may be linked to low birth weights. In Evansville, Illinois, the water is already testing at 22 parts per billion.
[2:25:37.000 --> 2:25:42.000]  For the EPA, that's not a concern. Their concern is corn.
[2:25:42.000 --> 2:26:00.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, corn is used as a filler. I don't have to apologize to corn farmers to tell them that you notice that farmers in those areas have a lot of cancers, a lot of problems, and your daughters can't have children and your sons basically can't have sex because they don't have genitals.
[2:26:00.000 --> 2:26:08.000]  Now, I mean, you heard, that's putting it lightly that the testicles don't send in a lot of people. That's what gets reported.
[2:26:08.000 --> 2:26:17.000]  But you know, if dad's wondering why he had a good size Johnson and his son basically doesn't have a penis, it's because atrazine, okay? It's not a lot of matter.
[2:26:17.000 --> 2:26:27.000]  So, and of course those cancerous sons are going to get. So they need to ban atrazine and they've got a lot of other pesticides that don't do this. Still not good for your liver.
[2:26:27.000 --> 2:26:37.000]  But atrazine bio accumulates in the corn and it gets into the water table and it stays there for years. I'm going to tell farmers something and yeah, I'm going to try to fund ourselves at the same time.
[2:26:37.000 --> 2:26:53.000]  If you live and get municipal water, or you've got well water, or you live anywhere near farming, you are insane if you don't use a gravity-fed filter that takes out all the bad chemicals but leaves the good minerals in.
[2:26:53.000 --> 2:27:02.000]  And that's the electric pure breeze, the highest rated filtration system you're going to find out there for anywhere near the price, top rated for 33% off at fulmorestore.com.
[2:27:02.000 --> 2:27:11.000]  I, religiously, if I catch my daughters or my son drinking out of a water fountain at school, they're grounded for weeks.
[2:27:11.000 --> 2:27:22.000]  If I catch them not drinking reverse osmosis distilled or out of the filters we have at the office of the house, I chew them out.
[2:27:22.000 --> 2:27:35.000]  And we're not weirdo neurotics. When I go to most restaurants and places, I've got my own packet of tea. I've got my own drink and I can bottle water and I make it right there and I ask them for a glass and I make it.
[2:27:35.000 --> 2:27:43.000]  And people say, why are you doing that? And I said, oh, because I don't like cancer. The number one thing you can do is stop bad water getting into your body.
[2:27:43.000 --> 2:27:52.000]  And they put fluoride and hundreds of other chemicals under the name of it in the water and have waivers in California around their own prop 65 to do it.
[2:27:52.000 --> 2:27:56.000]  So I'm going to tell you again, folks, they're hitting us through the water.
[2:27:56.000 --> 2:28:13.000]  And I'm pissed at Trump, allowing the EPA to do this. And it's serious. And it's not just the atrazine, but if you don't get a water filtration system and reduce it as much as you can.
[2:28:13.000 --> 2:28:21.000]  And if you don't get the systems we sell are some of the highest rated shower filters. They don't cut everything out. They cut it back 99% or so. This goes even more than that.
[2:28:21.000 --> 2:28:32.000]  But you're not breathing. It's not your biggest work in your skin. If you love your children, filter your water, your bathwater, your rainwater, all of it.

[2:30:15.000 --> 2:30:20.000]  I'm very thankful to the good Lord for the Constitution I've been given.
[2:30:20.000 --> 2:30:29.000]  But up until about eight, nine years ago when I started taking X2 and the products in Forrest Life, I still got sick every couple of years.
[2:30:29.000 --> 2:30:34.000]  And I still get sore throats from allergies and pollen and things like that.
[2:30:34.000 --> 2:30:45.000]  But now that I religiously take the products in Forrest Life, one of the highest quality stuff that you're going to find out there, I just never get a fever anymore.
[2:30:45.000 --> 2:30:54.000]  It's probably been three, four years since I've had a fever. It's just crazy. So I chalk it up to genetics and the great products.

[2:33:13.000 --> 2:33:30.000]  From deep in the heart of FEMA Region 6, Austin, Texas, transmitting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[2:33:30.000 --> 2:33:40.000]  Storm clouds are above Washington, D.C. Our reporters are on the ground giving continual live coverage at man.video.
[2:33:40.000 --> 2:33:47.000]  Infowars.com for its live show. We fuse it all together here with a radio slash TV transmission.
[2:33:47.000 --> 2:33:55.000]  We're live 10 hours a day. I'd like to be live more. We're just working on getting the crew and the operations, the money.
[2:33:55.000 --> 2:34:00.000]  Love Will Johnson, the work he's been doing as a reporter for us, had to suspend that show for a while, but he just didn't have the crew.
[2:34:00.000 --> 2:34:06.000]  A couple of folks had to leave because they had family members that were sick to take care of and never parts of the country that had been here years.
[2:34:06.000 --> 2:34:19.000]  I mean, that were that rag tag organization that when we go on the road with the biggest crew as we had, we have a skeleton crew back here that's working 18 hours a day.
[2:34:19.000 --> 2:34:27.000]  So I want to thank the Lushers for the support, but listen, this isn't a passion for making money. It's not a passion for being famous.
[2:34:27.000 --> 2:34:29.000]  It's not a passion for any of that.
[2:34:29.000 --> 2:34:36.000]  I'm not going to lie to you, I like a good steak dinner, I like driving a good fast car, I like having money for medical care for my kids.
[2:34:36.000 --> 2:34:42.000]  I like not having to worry about having money in the bank, but that's where it ends.
[2:34:42.000 --> 2:34:47.000]  I want to secure our freedoms and our liberty, and that's most important.
[2:34:47.000 --> 2:34:56.000]  So I will fight the globalist until I'm living in a shack because it's our rights and our freedoms that are the most valuable.
[2:34:56.000 --> 2:35:02.000]  I do all this and I fight hard like this because I'm just like you. I don't want to be a slave.
[2:35:02.000 --> 2:35:08.000]  And I know our hard fought rights are under real sustained assault.
[2:35:08.000 --> 2:35:17.000]  But just since we started waking up, the tide's turning all over the world and the enemy's trying to just wear us out.
[2:35:17.000 --> 2:35:24.000]  So something hit me and then I want to finish up with this news and it's all the other news and Mike Adams coming up.
[2:35:24.000 --> 2:35:27.000]  Something really hit me during the break.
[2:35:27.000 --> 2:35:30.000]  I was back during the coffee room.
[2:35:30.000 --> 2:35:35.000]  I've been visiting in that a little bit more today because I didn't have much sleep while I was out of town, so I'm exhausted.
[2:35:35.000 --> 2:35:37.000]  Usually you just have maybe two cups by now.
[2:35:37.000 --> 2:35:43.000]  I'm on like cup number four of this Wake Up America coffee, which is very strong.
[2:35:43.000 --> 2:35:45.000]  I'm being a very bad boy right now, but it is good.
[2:35:45.000 --> 2:35:50.000]  Whoever knew getting high was so delicious.
[2:35:50.000 --> 2:36:04.000]  Anyway, it's continuing and I was watching Adam Schiff get bucks big buddy part of the course.
[2:36:04.000 --> 2:36:07.000]  And it just hit me.
[2:36:07.000 --> 2:36:09.000]  And I want to say this is going to be incredibly obvious.
[2:36:09.000 --> 2:36:12.000]  You're going, oh, wow, Alex, that's tell us the grass is green next.
[2:36:12.000 --> 2:36:19.000]  But of all the reasons they keep this impeachment going and the fake investigations going and all of it is.
[2:36:19.000 --> 2:36:27.000]  First and foremost, to change the subject from what losers they are and how their cities are collapsing and how corrupt they are and how evil they are.
[2:36:27.000 --> 2:36:35.000]  And to keep Trump on the defense and to hog up all the time and energy and to be the center of attention.
[2:36:35.000 --> 2:36:43.000]  But the reason they got to keep the impeachment going as long as possible is their racing to dig up more fake dirt, more new scandals.
[2:36:43.000 --> 2:37:00.000]  And they just can't believe that they've never found with giant illegal drag nets and phone company records and harassment and threats to put all these people in prison.
[2:37:00.000 --> 2:37:02.000]  They've done all of that.
[2:37:02.000 --> 2:37:04.000]  All of it.
[2:37:04.000 --> 2:37:08.000]  And they haven't found anything Trump's done.
[2:37:08.000 --> 2:37:13.000]  Because Trump's a straight shooter, he does everything he does out in the open, knowing everybody's trying to set him up.
[2:37:13.000 --> 2:37:15.000]  I mean, I've always been a straight lace guy.
[2:37:15.000 --> 2:37:17.000]  OK, very conservative.
[2:37:17.000 --> 2:37:18.000]  I'm guilty.
[2:37:18.000 --> 2:37:20.000]  I have too much coffee.
[2:37:20.000 --> 2:37:23.000]  Don't even speed anymore down the road.
[2:37:23.000 --> 2:37:25.000]  Let's say I've cut back massively.
[2:37:25.000 --> 2:37:26.000]  Kind of a white lie.
[2:37:26.000 --> 2:37:29.000]  Every once in a while, I get a little bit of power, a little bit of a jolt there.
[2:37:29.000 --> 2:37:32.000]  Hit 120 on that country road when I'm by myself.
[2:37:32.000 --> 2:37:42.000]  When you are prominent and are in the public eye, people are trying to set you up for stuff you've done.
[2:37:42.000 --> 2:37:44.000]  So it doesn't even surprise me.
[2:37:44.000 --> 2:37:52.000]  They can't find anything on Trump because he's been 50 years, people trying to put his ass in prison, trying to shake him down.
[2:37:52.000 --> 2:38:01.000]  And so that's why they're so upset and why they're so scared because with them, you can't swing a stick and not hit corruption.
[2:38:01.000 --> 2:38:02.000]  Notice that's what they're telling you.
[2:38:02.000 --> 2:38:04.000]  Oh, Hillary's emails of her corruption.
[2:38:04.000 --> 2:38:05.000]  It's a crime to put those out.
[2:38:05.000 --> 2:38:07.000]  Oh, you exposed what we're doing in Ukraine.
[2:38:07.000 --> 2:38:10.000]  Oh, you're a criminal for that.
[2:38:10.000 --> 2:38:18.000]  It's a total inversion of reality.
[2:38:18.000 --> 2:38:21.000]  And that's all this is, is sucking all the oxygen out of the room.
[2:38:21.000 --> 2:38:26.000]  And so that's why I'm not going to cover the impeachment very much or the trial.
[2:38:26.000 --> 2:38:35.000]  When Republicans do their defense after almost three and a half, four months of this BS, I will cover that.
[2:38:35.000 --> 2:38:42.000]  And our recruits on the ground, they'll be there bringing up issues to globalists and friendly confrontations and journalism and we'll have them on.
[2:38:42.000 --> 2:38:46.000]  But I'm just not going to commit the lion's share of the broadcast.
[2:38:46.000 --> 2:38:55.000]  And I think you agree with me to hit listening to Adam Schiff because every time he opens his mouth, another lie or half truth or twisted garbage comes up.
[2:38:55.000 --> 2:39:02.000]  Now I wanted to finish up on the whole atrazine and what's doing to people.
[2:39:02.000 --> 2:39:05.000]  Blaze TV ran into me at the Virginia rally.
[2:39:05.000 --> 2:39:07.000]  And this is part of what I had to say.
[2:39:07.000 --> 2:39:36.000]  I would love to take credit 20 years ago when it was in Berkeley science reports and other top research reports that atrazine sterilizes and reduces the fertility of amphibians.
[2:39:36.000 --> 2:39:41.000]  Of fish, of birds, but also of mammals.
[2:39:41.000 --> 2:39:45.000]  And so, but what it does is it also confuses males and then that's what happens to frogs.
[2:39:45.000 --> 2:39:49.000]  They want to have sex with the male frog, but then they don't have any eggs.
[2:39:49.000 --> 2:39:50.000]  And so the frogs died.
[2:39:50.000 --> 2:39:52.000]  And so I said, listen, I'm not against gay people.
[2:39:52.000 --> 2:39:55.000]  I just don't want to put in chemicals in the water to make the frigging frogs gay.
[2:39:55.000 --> 2:40:05.000]  And the media, every late night comic, they all attack me knowing full damn well that atrazine is a very toxic chemical and even tiny amounts of it will literally basically shrivel your balls.
[2:40:05.000 --> 2:40:06.000]  And everything else up.
[2:40:06.000 --> 2:40:07.000]  You don't even have a sex life.
[2:40:07.000 --> 2:40:08.000]  Okay.
[2:40:08.000 --> 2:40:09.000]  And he'll fry your brain.
[2:40:09.000 --> 2:40:11.000]  And so it doesn't just quote, make you gay.
[2:40:11.000 --> 2:40:13.000]  That was just something the media picked up on.
[2:40:13.000 --> 2:40:17.000]  Even though studies show it makes the male frogs want to have sex with the other male frogs.
[2:40:17.000 --> 2:40:18.000]  Okay.
[2:40:18.000 --> 2:40:19.000]  So it screws up their olfactory nerve, everything.
[2:40:19.000 --> 2:40:22.000]  And then it turns out the Pentagon had, this is BBC news.
[2:40:22.000 --> 2:40:34.000]  This is Reuters 25 years ago, a gay bomb that was made up of a mixture of LSD and atrazine where they would spray it on groups of troops and the men would start flipping out, literally having sex with each other.
[2:40:34.000 --> 2:40:36.000]  So that's what chemicals can do.
[2:40:36.000 --> 2:40:38.000]  That's what our noses do.
[2:40:38.000 --> 2:40:40.000]  That's why my wife's right here.
[2:40:40.000 --> 2:40:41.000]  I smell my wife.
[2:40:41.000 --> 2:40:43.000]  I mean, she smells really damn good.
[2:40:43.000 --> 2:40:44.000]  Okay.
[2:40:44.000 --> 2:40:45.000]  But you've got a bunch of atrazine.
[2:40:45.000 --> 2:40:47.000]  Well, then a dude starts smelling good to you.
[2:40:47.000 --> 2:40:49.000]  You know, it's kind of a piece of smells really good.
[2:40:49.000 --> 2:40:51.000]  Don't even really look that good, but you know, it smells good.
[2:40:51.000 --> 2:40:52.000]  You eat it.
[2:40:52.000 --> 2:40:56.000]  Well, imagine you take this stuff where these chemicals get you, dude starts smelling good.
[2:40:56.000 --> 2:40:58.000]  So David Hogg and all make a big joke about it.
[2:40:58.000 --> 2:40:59.000]  It's not funny.
[2:40:59.000 --> 2:41:01.000]  It totally takes over your brain.
[2:41:01.000 --> 2:41:02.000]  It gives you cancer.
[2:41:02.000 --> 2:41:04.000]  There's a whole bunch of other crap.
[2:41:04.000 --> 2:41:10.000]  And, you know, one of the side effects is in mammals and in so many other things is
[2:41:10.000 --> 2:41:11.000]  that it literally makes you attractive.
[2:41:11.000 --> 2:41:13.000]  Why are they loosening up regulations on it?
[2:41:13.000 --> 2:41:14.000]  Then recently that was just covered.
[2:41:14.000 --> 2:41:15.000]  They loosened up regulations on it.
[2:41:15.000 --> 2:41:16.000]  Yes.
[2:41:16.000 --> 2:41:18.000]  I saw the Tucker Carlson on Friday attack Trump.
[2:41:18.000 --> 2:41:19.000]  He's absolutely right.
[2:41:19.000 --> 2:41:20.000]  Okay.
[2:41:20.000 --> 2:41:21.000]  So there's just part of that report.
[2:41:21.000 --> 2:41:27.000]  And the reason I play that is I got asked that by Fox News that was there, local Fox
[2:41:27.000 --> 2:41:28.000]  News.
[2:41:28.000 --> 2:41:30.000]  I got asked by blaze TV, full reports on band.video.
[2:41:30.000 --> 2:41:32.000]  I had asked that by a lot of people.
[2:41:32.000 --> 2:41:34.000]  Hey, the gay frogs are real.
[2:41:34.000 --> 2:41:36.000]  Tucker Carlson covered it.
[2:41:36.000 --> 2:41:39.000]  But again, it's the dead frogs.
[2:41:39.000 --> 2:41:40.000]  It's not the gay frogs.
[2:41:40.000 --> 2:41:41.000]  It's the dead frogs.
[2:41:41.000 --> 2:41:44.000]  And I'm just sitting there thinking about solutions.
[2:41:44.000 --> 2:41:48.000]  One thing is the public, just like Epstein or just about world government are now waking
[2:41:48.000 --> 2:41:51.000]  up to it so we can do something about it.
[2:41:51.000 --> 2:41:58.000]  And notice the EPA is pushing back saying, we're not even going to count as bad anymore
[2:41:58.000 --> 2:42:04.000]  because its levels are going up and people get pissed when they see it in the reports.
[2:42:04.000 --> 2:42:07.000]  Fukushima hit the West Coast at hundreds of times safe levels.
[2:42:07.000 --> 2:42:08.000]  That was in the news.
[2:42:08.000 --> 2:42:09.000]  It was confirmed by universities.
[2:42:09.000 --> 2:42:12.240]  They went, oh, we'll just raise the level and say it's safe and stop reporting these
[2:42:12.240 --> 2:42:14.600]  other levels because we now say it's safe.
[2:42:14.600 --> 2:42:19.160]  That's really what they did because your local health departments and others are testing
[2:42:19.160 --> 2:42:21.840]  the water under federal grants.
[2:42:21.840 --> 2:42:27.200]  And the EPA says we don't want that tested anymore because now you're aware.
[2:42:27.200 --> 2:42:28.200]  Big article.
[2:42:28.200 --> 2:42:33.200]  Americans expose the toxic chemicals in drinking water dramatically underestimated.
[2:42:33.200 --> 2:42:38.880]  Fox News is a big report put out by the federal government and other groups.
[2:42:38.880 --> 2:42:39.880]  There it is.
[2:42:39.880 --> 2:42:42.600]  They're hitting us through the water.
[2:42:42.600 --> 2:42:46.280]  So yes, let's defend our right to second amendment, but the right to defend ourselves
[2:42:46.280 --> 2:42:50.520]  is knowing what's going on through the water, the water, the air.
[2:42:50.520 --> 2:42:58.120]  That's where the shadow government deep state technology is heading us this is a call for
[2:42:58.120 --> 2:42:59.120]  modern day.
[2:42:59.120 --> 2:43:02.280]  Paul Revere's who are all Americans who are all human beings who bleed red blood, love

[2:44:54.680 --> 2:44:58.920]  I want to talk about super silver whitening toothpaste because I hadn't tried it except
[2:44:58.920 --> 2:45:03.440]  for maybe the last week and a half and I told Alex I said man this is the best toothpaste
[2:45:03.440 --> 2:45:04.440]  I've ever tried.
[2:45:04.440 --> 2:45:07.040]  He's like well what are you doing just sitting in here telling me you got to get up there
[2:45:07.040 --> 2:45:12.560]  and tell people and oh so here I am telling people super silver whitening toothpaste is
[2:45:12.560 --> 2:45:17.600]  by far the best toothpaste I've ever tried and I'm 45 years old and I've tried a lot
[2:45:17.600 --> 2:45:20.640]  of different toothpaste and it's fluoride free.
[2:45:20.640 --> 2:45:24.800]  I think the big difference the game changer in this is the coral calcium because after
[2:45:24.800 --> 2:45:29.440]  I brush my teeth with this they feel so clean and the toothpaste that I don't even like
[2:45:29.440 --> 2:45:32.280]  rinse out my mouth after I brush my teeth with this.
[2:45:32.280 --> 2:45:33.560]  It feels so good.
[2:45:33.560 --> 2:45:37.760]  It feels like it feels like good things are happening in my mouth.
[2:45:37.760 --> 2:45:43.000]  In fact I find myself brushing my teeth three to four times a day rather than just twice
[2:45:43.000 --> 2:45:54.800]  a day now because I like the way it feels.
[2:45:54.800 --> 2:45:59.080]  I would thank you for everything you've done for the info war but I know you're like me.
[2:45:59.080 --> 2:46:01.000]  You don't want my thanks.
[2:46:01.000 --> 2:46:04.880]  You want victory over the globalist and these devil worship and child molesters and you
[2:46:04.880 --> 2:46:08.800]  want them off your back and off your children's back and you know what I'm the same way and
[2:46:08.800 --> 2:46:13.400]  that's why we're on the same damn team and it's why info wars has been delivering time
[2:46:13.400 --> 2:46:20.680]  and time again when it's clutch time to focus the people on taking action against the globalist
[2:46:20.680 --> 2:46:26.160]  because I'm committed to a future for humanity and I know you are as well.
[2:46:26.160 --> 2:46:29.960]  So thank you in 2019 for standing with us because you are the info war and I want to
[2:46:29.960 --> 2:46:35.280]  thank you for committing to stand with us in 2020 however you can for bottom my heart
[2:46:35.280 --> 2:46:37.960]  from my family and from the great crew at info wars.
[2:46:37.960 --> 2:46:42.000]  I want to thank you all because you are the info war and you know that's not just words
[2:46:42.000 --> 2:46:44.040]  that's reality.
[2:46:44.040 --> 2:46:45.600]  You have made history.
[2:46:45.600 --> 2:46:53.040]  We have made history together info wars dot com only has power because of you and I suggest
[2:46:53.040 --> 2:47:13.560]  you use it you're listening to the Alex Jones show from the front lines of the information
[2:47:13.560 --> 2:47:25.080]  war it's Alex Jones in defiance of the globalist deep state the White House is listening to
[2:47:25.080 --> 2:47:33.360]  info wars right now several offices have war runs with big TVs all over the walls but they're
[2:47:33.360 --> 2:47:37.200]  monitoring the news and info wars is right there at the center they're watching right
[2:47:37.200 --> 2:47:43.160]  now people notice this the media noticed it three four years ago and said oh my gosh we
[2:47:43.160 --> 2:47:48.360]  got to shut Alex Jones down we got to ban Trump seeing info wars but the truth is once
[2:47:48.360 --> 2:47:53.160]  you see the perspective of how the globalists work everything then makes sense not from
[2:47:53.160 --> 2:47:58.080]  their narrative then it makes no sense when you know the real globalist narrative you
[2:47:58.080 --> 2:48:01.960]  already know it's in WikiLeaks before you read it and then sure enough there it is Hillary
[2:48:01.960 --> 2:48:07.920]  talking to a top professor of psychology on how to create a race war in America they talk
[2:48:07.920 --> 2:48:11.720]  about no one believes us everyone hates us now we can't give everybody free money what
[2:48:11.720 --> 2:48:17.920]  are we going to do well just have a race war have more culture war so the globalists think
[2:48:17.920 --> 2:48:23.200]  they can stop the signal it's not even a signal once you have the perspective like look at
[2:48:23.200 --> 2:48:25.960]  it a piece of architecture you don't see the building from the right angle once you get
[2:48:25.960 --> 2:48:31.800]  the right angle you can see the whole structure basically from from from one angle they can
[2:48:31.800 --> 2:48:36.400]  play tricks on you so I keep pointing out that China and India and a whole bunch of
[2:48:36.400 --> 2:48:41.200]  the third world countries are responsible for almost all the pollution and on purpose
[2:48:41.200 --> 2:48:45.840]  dump it right in the ocean and on purpose have no controls and then notice the White
[2:48:45.840 --> 2:48:49.600]  House has picked that up recently and so have all the cartoonists and people that's not
[2:48:49.600 --> 2:48:57.560]  rocket science that's the truth but there's other examples like weeks before Trump a few
[2:48:57.560 --> 2:49:03.800]  years ago said why does the Pope say get rid of walls in Europe or the US but they've
[2:49:03.800 --> 2:49:08.200]  got 200 foot walls around the Vatican that was a common sense call we were the first
[2:49:08.200 --> 2:49:13.440]  to point it out the meme got picked up everywhere Trump retweeted it it's not about getting
[2:49:13.440 --> 2:49:18.800]  credit it's about learning why our audience who see stuff before I do not kissing your
[2:49:18.800 --> 2:49:22.760]  ass it's true you're the type of people that are looking at things from different angles
[2:49:22.760 --> 2:49:26.400]  you're trying to figure it out you're not just taking it at face value like you've
[2:49:26.400 --> 2:49:31.720]  never jumped off of some rocks in a creek you've ever been to looks crystal clear looks
[2:49:31.720 --> 2:49:35.280]  20 feet deep you're going to crawl down there first and make sure there's not any hidden
[2:49:35.280 --> 2:49:39.320]  rocks or anything or some barbed wire down there for that from a washed in you're going
[2:49:39.320 --> 2:49:44.200]  to swim in there before you jump in there even though it looks safe hey kids don't
[2:49:44.200 --> 2:49:48.160]  jump off there yet let me swim around here and check it that's all we do we don't just
[2:49:48.160 --> 2:49:55.120]  receive what we're told and just buy it and so that's why Trump is synced with us because
[2:49:55.120 --> 2:49:59.960]  he's the same way and when he gets the right info he makes the right decision and that's
[2:49:59.960 --> 2:50:06.400]  why they're so pissed and so that's the Trump phenomenon is that he's really the president
[2:50:06.400 --> 2:50:10.720]  and he's winning and he's starting to get control of the executive branch and they've
[2:50:10.720 --> 2:50:16.120]  got all these articles and headlines about oh the odds are he's going to beat the Senate
[2:50:16.120 --> 2:50:19.760]  trial for impeachment and he's going to get reelected that's when you got to watch out
[2:50:19.760 --> 2:50:23.680]  though folks and I want to talk more in the days and weeks to come about the Achilles
[2:50:23.680 --> 2:50:30.080]  Hill of Trump with only 285 days out to the election 285 because we all heard Hillary was
[2:50:30.080 --> 2:50:36.080]  invincible and that's why I said she was going to lose Maiden voyage the Titanic they said
[2:50:36.080 --> 2:50:45.040]  not even God can sink this ship they are on purpose saying Trump's a shoe in now because
[2:50:45.040 --> 2:50:49.880]  they're planning to plunge the economy they're planning to start wars to embarrass the president
[2:50:49.880 --> 2:50:58.320]  they're planning to use bio crises they use everything and so the president needs to know
[2:50:58.320 --> 2:51:01.600]  that he's walking into a trap with election fraud and of course he's going to win in a
[2:51:01.600 --> 2:51:06.360]  landslide if we have a free and fair election we're not they've got illegal aliens registering
[2:51:06.360 --> 2:51:16.880]  to vote all over the country publicly now handing out the driver's license Hillary was
[2:51:16.880 --> 2:51:22.000]  a paper tiger Trump isn't but when you start thinking you're invincible that's right when
[2:51:22.000 --> 2:51:30.200]  the fall happens now I've been saying why doesn't he counter Greta Thunberg for the
[2:51:30.200 --> 2:51:36.320]  fact that she never talks about China and India and how they are absolutely polluting
[2:51:36.320 --> 2:51:42.080]  on purpose especially China India is trying to industrialize China and I'm not defending
[2:51:42.080 --> 2:51:47.300]  it but China is doing it on purpose as worse as they can economic warfare against us funding
[2:51:47.300 --> 2:51:52.080]  shutting down and you know our cold plant shipping toxic waste here just doing everything
[2:51:52.080 --> 2:51:58.680]  evil you can imagine shutting down our industries buying up Hollywood to brainwashes Greta Thunberg
[2:51:58.680 --> 2:52:02.400]  is flying around these big jets he says they're evil all day that's not real pollution folks
[2:52:02.400 --> 2:52:08.160]  radiation from reactors is dumping toxic waste in the ocean is genetic engineering is pollution
[2:52:08.160 --> 2:52:16.760]  that lasts forever in species and causes massive societal biosphere shutdowns but again the
[2:52:16.760 --> 2:52:22.600]  very people destroying the earth the globalists that say it's a post human post carbon world
[2:52:22.600 --> 2:52:32.760]  that are that follow some sick worship of AI silicon sand talk about castles made of
[2:52:32.760 --> 2:52:40.560]  sand will collapse in the sea eventually to quote Jimi Hendrix so they're the ones claiming
[2:52:40.560 --> 2:52:44.600]  they guard the environment all day while they're the ones that are playing God and actually
[2:52:44.600 --> 2:52:49.280]  destroying it in mass and dumping at resin and everything so Trump needs to be the champion
[2:52:49.280 --> 2:52:54.680]  of real environmentalism not deindustrialization anti human environmentalism that's meant
[2:52:54.680 --> 2:52:59.600]  to only empower authoritarian regimes and shut us down and he's starting to do that so these
[2:52:59.600 --> 2:53:04.640]  aren't talking points these are truths so here's a compilation of trumpet Davos today
[2:53:04.640 --> 2:53:10.800]  countering Greta in live time with her saying I told you I want you to panic I am your boss
[2:53:10.800 --> 2:53:16.440]  everything is over if you're not doing exactly as I say to you now come with me if you want
[2:53:16.440 --> 2:53:24.120]  to live humans are bad do not have children you are evil especially if you are European
[2:53:24.120 --> 2:53:31.960]  it is how dare you Greta ought to focus on those places but we are doing better right
[2:53:31.960 --> 2:53:38.240]  now than we've ever done in terms of cleanliness in terms of numbers because that world in
[2:53:38.240 --> 2:53:44.840]  case you haven't noticed is currently on fire but to embrace the possibilities of tomorrow
[2:53:44.840 --> 2:53:52.840]  we must reject the perennial prophets of doom and their predictions of the apocalypse they
[2:53:52.840 --> 2:53:58.000]  are the heirs of yesterday's foolish fortune tellers who will never let radical socialists
[2:53:58.000 --> 2:54:05.960]  destroy our economy wreck our country or eradicate our liberty America will always be the proud
[2:54:05.960 --> 2:54:14.440]  strong and unyielding bastion of freedom we couldn't care less about your party politics
[2:54:14.440 --> 2:54:21.320]  from sustainability perspective the right the left as well as the center have all failed
[2:54:21.320 --> 2:54:33.320]  our house is still on fire your inaction is fueling the flames by the hour and we are
[2:54:33.320 --> 2:54:41.520]  telling you to act as if you loved your children above all else today I'm pleased to announce
[2:54:41.520 --> 2:54:48.320]  the United States will join one trillion trees initiative being launched here at the world
[2:54:48.320 --> 2:54:57.960]  economic forum one trillion trees planting trees is good of course but it's nowhere
[2:54:57.960 --> 2:55:05.880]  near enough of what is needed and it cannot replace real mitigation and rewilding nature
[2:55:05.880 --> 2:55:11.640]  I think that some people are they put it at a level that is you know unrealistic to a
[2:55:11.640 --> 2:55:15.720]  point you can't live your lives we want to have the cleanest water on earth we want to
[2:55:15.720 --> 2:55:21.000]  have the cleanest air on earth our numbers as you saw we had record numbers come out
[2:55:21.000 --> 2:55:25.600]  very recently our numbers are very very good our environmental numbers our water numbers
[2:55:25.600 --> 2:55:33.160]  are our numbers on air are tremendous we have to do something about other continents we
[2:55:33.160 --> 2:55:38.200]  have to do something about other countries it's all about other countries having no
[2:55:38.200 --> 2:55:43.600]  standards by design to deindustrialize this but president trump wasn't knowingly lying
[2:55:43.600 --> 2:55:47.880]  to you there at the end in my view because what he told you on its face statistically
[2:55:47.880 --> 2:55:54.920]  is true if China and India and 160 plus of the third world countries are way up here
[2:55:54.920 --> 2:56:00.640]  thousands and thousands and thousands of times higher on the total output of chemicals
[2:56:00.640 --> 2:56:04.800]  and toxins compared to the US one of the cleanest countries in the world if they're way worse
[2:56:04.800 --> 2:56:11.200]  than us he goes hey we're doing a lot better because we're not as high but if you let higher
[2:56:11.200 --> 2:56:19.200]  levels come in just because we're way better it doesn't matter trump president trump you
[2:56:19.200 --> 2:56:22.440]  don't want baron taking those vaccines you know what they did to him you know they're
[2:56:22.440 --> 2:56:27.200]  tainted well imagine what the atrazine is going to do to baron's son or daughter so
[2:56:27.200 --> 2:56:32.480]  this is serious but he's absolutely right why are all these other countries exempt but
[2:56:32.480 --> 2:56:38.760]  us and the west because it's a deindustrialization program openly run by the Rothschilds and
[2:56:38.760 --> 2:56:43.120]  their global carbon plan we don't care about your parties we don't care what group you
[2:56:43.120 --> 2:56:49.560]  pop up give us control of your energy and systems now we are in control and put that
[2:56:49.560 --> 2:56:55.280]  image of the poor african bush person somewhere in north africa walking around with cracks
[2:56:55.280 --> 2:57:03.960]  in the ground and she's saying she represents that poor african but you see low carbon
[2:57:03.960 --> 2:57:08.840]  dioxide levels is what have caused the sahara desert more than anything to expand the last
[2:57:08.840 --> 2:57:15.840]  few thousand years higher co2 levels make plants grow longer stronger better up to five six
[2:57:15.840 --> 2:57:22.680]  times being able to study and with less water and of course those bush folks have goats which
[2:57:22.680 --> 2:57:27.320]  pull up the roots of plants cows don't eat the roots so that's also causing this that's
[2:57:27.320 --> 2:57:33.480]  all your fault though folks okay so if you let redder run your library by the way electric
[2:57:33.480 --> 2:57:38.040]  cars use more fossil fuel than gas cars on average it's all a scam it's about the people
[2:57:38.040 --> 2:57:46.800]  she works for running our lives hour number four straight ahead i spend a lot of time
[2:57:46.800 --> 2:57:52.720]  reminding the info wars family of listeners and viewers that without you we won't be on
[2:57:52.720 --> 2:57:57.280]  the air and i spent a lot of time thanking you but i really think you should thank yourself
[2:57:57.280 --> 2:58:01.480]  for keeping us on the air and really changing the world for the better and raising the alarm
[2:58:01.480 --> 2:58:07.800]  as modern paul reveres but something i should spend more time on is just reminding you that
[2:58:07.800 --> 2:58:12.280]  these products are really amazing you've got that pledge from me but you've seen the third
[2:58:12.280 --> 2:58:17.040]  party test out there the air filtration the water filtration the supplements are all the
[2:58:17.040 --> 2:58:22.080]  very best you're going to find out there and you can't fund an operation anywhere else
[2:58:22.080 --> 2:58:29.000]  that's fighting the globalist this hard so it's not a burden to support info wars it
[2:58:29.000 --> 2:58:36.080]  really is something that is good for everybody that stands for justice and freedom and makes

[2:58:48.920 --> 2:58:54.640]  pollen block we have found an extraordinary new natural way to alleviate seasonal distress
[2:58:54.640 --> 2:59:01.000]  symptoms including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways eye comfort and respiratory
[2:59:01.000 --> 2:59:06.520]  function in the nineteen sixties researchers in france noticed that people who ate certain
[2:59:06.520 --> 2:59:12.320]  quail eggs experienced less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses they began studying
[2:59:12.320 --> 2:59:17.320]  this effect in published trials and decades later we now have the fruit of this research
[2:59:17.320 --> 2:59:23.960]  a fast-acting chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms pollen block is natural
[2:59:23.960 --> 2:59:29.280]  and effective it is not an antihistamine in fact current research has found that it actually
[2:59:29.280 --> 2:59:34.960]  acts by blocking the activity of triptase which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory
[2:59:34.960 --> 2:59:40.560]  responses in the body go outside and enjoy the air you breathe head to info wars life
[2:59:40.560 --> 2:59:49.640]  dot com and grab a pack of our pollen block chewable tablets you're listening to the alex
[2:59:49.640 --> 3:00:04.640]  jones show
[3:00:04.640 --> 3:00:11.000]  live from the info wars dot com studios you're listening to the alex jones show
[3:00:11.000 --> 3:00:36.760]  ladies and gentlemen i have an announcement to make here that is staggering i was getting
[3:00:36.760 --> 3:00:42.440]  on the plane yesterday to fly back from dc to austin texas i read this fox news article
[3:00:42.440 --> 3:00:48.000]  and it just hit me like a ton of bricks my heart jumped i follow the links i sent it
[3:00:48.000 --> 3:00:52.840]  to the producer was on the top of my stack this morning and then i got busy with all
[3:00:52.840 --> 3:00:56.760]  the other news and didn't make it the front and center story because there's just so much
[3:00:56.760 --> 3:01:04.480]  huge news this is beyond gigantic we've talked about california and prop sixty five they
[3:01:04.480 --> 3:01:13.320]  passed back in the nineties that you've you you have as much lead or another toxic substance
[3:01:13.320 --> 3:01:17.520]  in something you're selling as is in the air and naturally occurring you can be sued by
[3:01:17.520 --> 3:01:22.320]  lawyers but that there are waivers by the state and the federal government for the
[3:01:22.320 --> 3:01:28.200]  fluoride they put in the water because it's not just fluoride this is on record it's the
[3:01:28.200 --> 3:01:33.800]  toxic waste from the nuclear weapons production aluminum production and phosphate mining for
[3:01:33.800 --> 3:01:39.600]  fertilizers so under the name fluoride in laws they passed in late forties they can dump
[3:01:39.600 --> 3:01:50.140]  it in the water now scroll down and show them they can dump it in the water call it fluoride
[3:01:50.140 --> 3:01:58.640]  because it's been fluoridated it adds the fluoride as a electromagnetic acid to the
[3:01:58.640 --> 3:02:03.440]  toxic substance and then by law they say now that it's been bound to fluoride they can
[3:02:03.440 --> 3:02:11.360]  give it to you which makes it even more deadly by calling it fluoride fluoridated chemicals
[3:02:11.360 --> 3:02:14.840]  and if you look at most of what we get now is from china with skull and crossbones on
[3:02:14.840 --> 3:02:18.800]  it there's been big studies where they tested on average there's over three hundred chemicals
[3:02:18.800 --> 3:02:25.840]  on it so I was rereading this article about to cover it from fox news and then I read
[3:02:25.840 --> 3:02:29.880]  it again I went oh my gosh I should have covered this today as our top story look at this americans
[3:02:29.880 --> 3:02:35.160]  exposed to toxic chemicals in drinking water dramatically underestimated 110 million americans
[3:02:35.160 --> 3:02:41.000]  are thought to be affected by it it says it's causing all sorts of problems tap water in
[3:02:41.000 --> 3:02:47.680]  the united states is contaminated with toxic fluoridated chemicals at a higher rate than
[3:02:47.680 --> 3:02:52.280]  previously thought according to report here's what I'm saying they tell you all day we've
[3:02:52.280 --> 3:02:57.200]  got to keep the water safe to shut down us industry while they're dumping toxic chemicals
[3:02:57.200 --> 3:03:03.800]  from all over the world under the name fluoride into the water see they're the guardians of
[3:03:03.800 --> 3:03:08.160]  the environment then they're dumping poison in the water then giving themselves waivers
[3:03:08.160 --> 3:03:12.800]  because all the water is poisoned now we can't tell who else is dumping toxic waste in because
[3:03:12.800 --> 3:03:19.360]  they're dumping hundreds of chemicals in under the name fluoride this is so big so insane
[3:03:19.360 --> 3:03:22.760]  so over the top and then now everybody knows because we've been warning him you've been
[3:03:22.760 --> 3:03:27.360]  warning him so other independent groups are testing going what the hell they go oh all
[3:03:27.360 --> 3:03:31.360]  these towns need billions in water cleaning to stop it we don't know where it's all coming
[3:03:31.360 --> 3:03:40.480]  from they're adding it in under the rubric under the name the logo fluoride it's not
[3:03:40.480 --> 3:03:46.520]  calcium fluoride that you do need some for your teeth it's hydrofluorosilicic electrified
[3:03:46.520 --> 3:03:52.600]  acid based fluoride with toxic chemicals grignard reagents going into the water on a
[3:03:52.600 --> 3:03:58.640]  mass scale mixed in with a nice sample of atrazine from all the runoff from the crops
[3:03:58.640 --> 3:04:05.160]  and they're going oh my god we're testing it there's fluoridated poison and everything
[3:04:05.160 --> 3:04:10.920]  but nowhere do they say because they dump it in there it'd be like shooting your wife
[3:04:10.920 --> 3:04:18.160]  with a shotgun five times blowing her guts head everywhere and the cops get there and
[3:04:18.160 --> 3:04:23.080]  they test her and they go it appears she's got lead poisoning she died of lead poisoning
[3:04:23.080 --> 3:04:26.880]  you're like yeah I know it smokes them out of the barrel they're putting it in they're
[3:04:26.880 --> 3:04:33.800]  shooting us they're attacking us they're doing all of this in our face and then saying oh
[3:04:33.800 --> 3:04:37.720]  my god there's all these toxins in the water you better filter your water yes and we sell
[3:04:37.720 --> 3:04:42.320]  the very best unit out there to take it out to you and your family the Alexa pure filtration
[3:04:42.320 --> 3:04:47.080]  system 33% off of your store.com this can fund our operation help you and your family
[3:04:47.080 --> 3:04:52.080]  a 360 wham but you're crazy if you don't start filtering your damn water you'll be back.
[3:04:52.080 --> 3:04:59.960]  It is I the leader of Cobra here for a message to President Trump the American people and
[3:04:59.960 --> 3:05:07.040]  Alex Jones of Info Wars our operation for our partners the communists Chinese have bought
[3:05:07.040 --> 3:05:15.800]  control of your media but it's true your people are beginning to awaken that's why Cobra is
[3:05:15.800 --> 3:05:23.080]  launching operations to trigger race war mashings and bombings which will be blamed on those
[3:05:23.080 --> 3:05:30.200]  loyal to America anyone once we stage these attacks that does not blame it on Trump we'll
[3:05:30.200 --> 3:05:39.160]  also be targeted by Cobra in the future you see when you expose our false flags and fake
[3:05:39.160 --> 3:05:47.120]  media I will carry out attacks and then blame you like we've done with Alex Jones blaming
[3:05:47.120 --> 3:05:50.240]  him for mass shootings we committed.
[3:05:50.240 --> 3:06:20.080]  From the front lines of the information war it's Alex Jones.
[3:06:20.080 --> 3:06:25.760]  Ladies and gentlemen Alex Jones here broadcasting worldwide and I just got hit by a mega ton
[3:06:25.760 --> 3:06:32.080]  of bricks Fox News is reporting that there's hundreds of horrible chemicals in the water
[3:06:32.080 --> 3:06:38.880]  in a big new US government university report headline Americans exposed to toxic chemicals
[3:06:38.880 --> 3:06:47.200]  and drinking water dramatically underestimated new report says from all over the US so I
[3:06:47.200 --> 3:06:57.240]  started reading the report itself and they say it's fluorinated chemicals because under
[3:06:57.240 --> 3:07:01.440]  the rubric of adding fluoride to the water it's a bunch of chemicals hundreds of chemicals
[3:07:01.440 --> 3:07:07.800]  that are allowed to be with the floor height so the world's discovering that our water
[3:07:07.800 --> 3:07:13.520]  is super toxic but they're not saying where it's coming from it'd be like Chernobyl my
[3:07:13.520 --> 3:07:21.280]  god everybody's down to radiation it's thousands of times higher than it should be and then
[3:07:21.280 --> 3:07:27.240]  saying oh we have no idea what's doing it there's a smoking reactor a half mile away
[3:07:27.240 --> 3:07:41.120]  but see they're slowly covering their ass now oh there's fluoride fluoridated chemicals
[3:07:41.120 --> 3:07:53.600]  unbelievable now Millie weaver is going to be coming up folks from the capital and then
[3:07:53.600 --> 3:08:03.720]  we've got Mike Adams taking over here in just a few minutes the trial is going on right
[3:08:03.720 --> 3:08:17.400]  now of the president we're going to get a report from her
[3:08:17.400 --> 3:08:29.120]  but I've just got to tell you right now that do you understand ladies and gentlemen that
[3:08:29.120 --> 3:08:37.560]  there's some type of mind game or mind control going on here that is absolutely unbelievable
[3:08:37.560 --> 3:08:48.000]  where at the end of World War two they have the Nuremberg trials in Germany and the Nazi
[3:08:48.000 --> 3:08:52.840]  gun control and the Weimar Republic before that gun control plan comes out in the hearings
[3:08:52.840 --> 3:08:59.200]  and Senator Dodd not not the current Senator Dodd of recent history he goes and translates
[3:08:59.200 --> 3:09:04.440]  it only changes like five words in it and that becomes the 1968 gun control act and
[3:09:04.440 --> 3:09:09.600]  the Nazi rocket program became our NASA program I mean we adopted a lot of the Nazi stuff
[3:09:09.600 --> 3:09:17.720]  the auto bond became our highways but the Nazis learned from Stalin this is in Pulitzer
[3:09:17.720 --> 3:09:23.560]  prize winning books from World War two okay I mean you can go read these that if you put
[3:09:23.560 --> 3:09:29.600]  a certain amount of hydrofluorosilic acid in the water it makes people docile and dumb
[3:09:29.600 --> 3:09:34.120]  now all the studies are out now proving that but there's a big report come out government
[3:09:34.120 --> 3:09:41.720]  report Fox News that oh my god there's all this toxic waste in the water it's fluorinated
[3:09:41.720 --> 3:09:49.800]  chemicals well what does that mean it means you add an acid hydrofluorosilic acid is in
[3:09:49.800 --> 3:09:54.720]  the top five most deadly acids in the world it'll eat through things like the alien blood
[3:09:54.720 --> 3:10:04.400]  and alien it's deadly and anything you any other chemicals you add with it it's an adjuvant
[3:10:04.400 --> 3:10:10.800]  in the body it makes them worse it magnifies them it amplifies them it increases them massively
[3:10:10.800 --> 3:10:17.560]  incredibly massively and I keep saying how are they going after some company a little
[3:10:17.560 --> 3:10:21.160]  bit of toxic stuff because of the water on accident they go to prison but the government
[3:10:21.160 --> 3:10:27.520]  adds fluoridated hydrofluorosilic acid chemicals in and then now there's a big report out Fox
[3:10:27.520 --> 3:10:34.120]  News reporting on it it's all over the news saying it's fluoridated fluoride chemicals
[3:10:34.120 --> 3:10:45.200]  holy mackerel Toledo get it out man stop it but instead they're like we don't know where
[3:10:45.200 --> 3:10:50.120]  it's coming from we need billions of dollars in cleaning systems here to cut it out of
[3:10:50.120 --> 3:10:57.000]  wherever it's coming from you they add it at the water treatment plan and they're building
[3:10:57.000 --> 3:11:00.640]  new facilities all over the country to find out where the toxins are coming from when
[3:11:00.640 --> 3:11:05.400]  they're adding it at the chemical plant that's like a gun to your head went through your
[3:11:05.400 --> 3:11:09.480]  head off somebody goes let's find out why it's happening we don't know why it's happening
[3:11:09.480 --> 3:11:17.520]  it's it's it's unbelievable because no one can admit no one knows why there's all the
[3:11:17.520 --> 3:11:24.560]  chemicals because if you admit it you'll find out about the whole conspiracy which Joseph
[3:11:24.560 --> 3:11:35.520]  Stalin was doing with VI linen to the Russians and others it's roach poison folks that's
[3:11:35.520 --> 3:11:45.040]  all hydrofluorosilic acid is roaches run across it and they die about a week later
[3:11:45.040 --> 3:11:52.920]  or the minute they start licking it off their feet bye bye roach poison Millie Weaver joins
[3:11:52.920 --> 3:11:57.920]  us she's just now getting set up there live at the Capitol appreciate her joining us just
[3:11:57.920 --> 3:12:01.800]  hot off Virginia in the amazing report she filed there with her team and now they're
[3:12:01.800 --> 3:12:06.200]  at the Capitol I know breaking a lot of huge news so much I'll just ask her what's the
[3:12:06.200 --> 3:12:12.680]  latest Millie well I'm just out here there was just a press conference outside the US
[3:12:12.680 --> 3:12:19.160]  Capitol here in DC several attorney generals from various states from South Carolina Indiana
[3:12:19.160 --> 3:12:25.400]  Louisiana they've come out today in opposition of this impeachment sham they said that they
[3:12:25.400 --> 3:12:33.400]  believe that this whole thing is corrupt it's a sham it is uncalled for and that essentially
[3:12:33.400 --> 3:12:37.160]  they don't believe that this impeachment is actually going to go through in the Senate
[3:12:37.160 --> 3:12:42.360]  they don't think that Trump's going to be impeached based on the evidence or lack of evidence
[3:12:42.360 --> 3:12:50.760]  that they've seen so far so they're making a statement out here today Alex what's what's
[3:12:50.760 --> 3:12:57.520]  the feeling there on Capitol Hill what's what's the vibe well you know there were some anti-Trump
[3:12:57.520 --> 3:13:04.280]  protests planned for today and I'll tell you what Alex they were really small these protests
[3:13:04.280 --> 3:13:09.840]  are dwindling in size the anti-Trump protests just keep shrinking smaller and smaller and
[3:13:09.840 --> 3:13:15.840]  it's probably because of how booming the economy is how great we're doing with jobs the fact
[3:13:15.840 --> 3:13:20.920]  that 4 million people have been lifted from food stamps America's doing really good and
[3:13:20.920 --> 3:13:25.840]  Trump's helping with that and it just seems like I agree but I also think it's we've been
[3:13:25.840 --> 3:13:30.280]  lied to so much for the deep state everyone's sick of Adam Schiff but they just and Nadler
[3:13:30.280 --> 3:13:35.360]  and and Crypt Keeper they just can't stop though because they they just think they rule everything
[3:13:35.360 --> 3:13:42.000]  in their own little delusional Hitler bunkers oh exactly and earlier there was a small group
[3:13:42.000 --> 3:13:47.480]  of protesters and will Johnson I ran into him and a bunch of other conservative reporters
[3:13:47.480 --> 3:13:52.360]  and we were trying to ask them questions but they just said that we're fascists and they
[3:13:52.360 --> 3:13:57.200]  try to tell us we can be near their protests the same old same old they said oh we don't
[3:13:57.200 --> 3:14:02.160]  want you here you're not allowed here they ended up running off and leaving I guess they
[3:14:02.160 --> 3:14:07.200]  were afraid they said they were afraid because we're fascists they didn't like us asking questions
[3:14:07.200 --> 3:14:13.200]  but that is what we're dealing with out here it's I'm expecting that the protests are small
[3:14:13.200 --> 3:14:19.080]  now but as soon as the Senate decides to shoot down this impeachment sham I think that we're
[3:14:19.080 --> 3:14:23.760]  going to see a lot more protests out here later in the week Alex well you're going to
[3:14:23.760 --> 3:14:28.120]  be there covering it all live Millie and Mike Adams is about to take over but I wanted to
[3:14:28.120 --> 3:14:32.200]  get your take on the Virginia situation for a few minutes when we come back but but start
[3:14:32.200 --> 3:14:36.320]  getting into that I mean you've followed so many just incredible reports that are at band
[3:14:36.320 --> 3:14:41.240]  on video and also on your YouTube channel I'm just giving a snapshot of what the Virginia
[3:14:41.240 --> 3:14:46.680]  rally was like okay the Virginia rally was amazing I've never seen anything like it before
[3:14:46.680 --> 3:14:53.240]  Alex so many citizens out there carrying openly in defiance of the governor and the Democrats
[3:14:53.240 --> 3:14:58.400]  who want to take away their guns they had a gated off area where they wanted the protesters
[3:14:58.400 --> 3:15:05.720]  to go a anti-gun zone a gun-free zone so to speak but what was funny in the irony is
[3:15:05.720 --> 3:15:09.880]  that everyone was mostly staying outside of that area there were a small group of people
[3:15:09.880 --> 3:15:14.600]  in the area but way more people on the streets you had truckers going through the streets
[3:15:14.600 --> 3:15:22.080]  honking their horns jay breaking you just had absolute the spirit of rebellion and defiance
[3:15:22.080 --> 3:15:26.760]  against tyrannical people trying to take away their rights that's what we saw well I know
[3:15:26.760 --> 3:15:30.040]  you're calling a bunch of reports but I want to hear more from you I hope you'll join us
[3:15:30.040 --> 3:15:34.120]  for a couple segments tomorrow and I hope you can come on the war room today they're going
[3:15:34.120 --> 3:15:37.640]  to be hosted from the road as well but we just want to hear from you that's millennium
[3:15:37.640 --> 3:15:42.680]  Millie thank you so much I'll talk to you today or tomorrow amazing coming up Mike Adams
[3:15:42.680 --> 3:15:46.200]  is about to take over but I got one more thing I want to say and then I'll throw the baton

[3:19:20.000 --> 3:19:26.000]  because of the great team at info wars and we are all a team ladies and gentlemen so
[3:19:26.000 --> 3:19:31.000]  right now humanity's awakening is explosive it's powerful it's incredible but there's
[3:19:31.000 --> 3:19:36.800]  a lot more to come but I'm blowing through our backup money right now with our reporters
[3:19:36.800 --> 3:19:41.160]  doing triple the work they ever have because they volunteered to do it and Owen and the
[3:19:41.160 --> 3:19:45.920]  rest of crew will fight 18 hours a day seven days a week during this election year that's
[3:19:45.920 --> 3:19:50.360]  so critical but they need the financing to put them in the field go to info wars store
[3:19:50.360 --> 3:20:16.320]  dot com and fight for your own future you're listening to the alex jones show
[3:20:16.320 --> 3:20:35.440]  the magnitude of this is really hard to even describe we learned a few weeks ago that the
[3:20:35.440 --> 3:20:44.960]  U.N. had a meeting in December the official U.N. had scientists and that they admitted
[3:20:44.960 --> 3:20:50.360]  that vaccines were killing people that they were covering it up and that big pharma was
[3:20:50.360 --> 3:20:56.200]  not testing it other than natural news dot com and info wars dot com only a handful of
[3:20:56.200 --> 3:21:00.120]  sites covered it yeah we probably got a million and a half views total on the reports we did
[3:21:00.120 --> 3:21:09.800]  on our own platform but you'd think that'd be important well now this is even more insane
[3:21:09.800 --> 3:21:17.960]  I'm at the airport flying back from DC I'm just on fox news dot com Americans expose
[3:21:17.960 --> 3:21:24.040]  the toxic chemicals and drinking water dramatically underestimated report they go on to say they
[3:21:24.040 --> 3:21:30.320]  don't know where it's coming from but there's toxic fluoridated chemicals at much higher
[3:21:30.320 --> 3:21:38.120]  rates at deadly levels affecting at least 110 million Americans and it goes into these
[3:21:38.120 --> 3:21:42.760]  forever chemicals that they can't get rid of because it's bound in with the acid based
[3:21:42.760 --> 3:21:47.000]  fluoride which they have waivers it's how they add the chemical toxic waste the water
[3:21:47.000 --> 3:21:52.320]  calling it fluoridated because what they do is they fluoridate with this acid toxic chemicals
[3:21:52.320 --> 3:21:57.840]  it dissolves into it and they call it fluoride and then Congress passed the law so they could
[3:21:57.840 --> 3:22:02.040]  do this and this Stanley Kubrick make jokes about what Dr. Strange loved because people
[3:22:02.040 --> 3:22:06.200]  got up and arms saying it's a communist plot to put it in the water to make us dumb and
[3:22:06.200 --> 3:22:12.440]  make us infertile because the Soviets had done that they've done it to the Russians
[3:22:12.440 --> 3:22:18.040]  that's in history books but now look at the public massive infertility massive low sperm
[3:22:18.040 --> 3:22:24.080]  counts incredibly low IQs and Harvard admits it's the fluoride but now to have big studies
[3:22:24.080 --> 3:22:27.920]  out going we don't know where those chemicals coming from when they're adding it there
[3:22:27.920 --> 3:22:31.920]  if you like somebody coming to your house the meat Cleaver and hacking your family and
[3:22:31.920 --> 3:22:36.240]  going I don't know who's got this meat Cleaver killing people or I went to the lake with
[3:22:36.240 --> 3:22:39.760]  cyanide hypothetically it was like right in front of the police going somebody's putting
[3:22:39.760 --> 3:22:43.080]  cyanide in the water I did a test the other day look officers they're like yeah it's you
[3:22:43.080 --> 3:22:50.720]  put your handcuffs wow so yes I was already planning a big push because Tucker Carlson
[3:22:50.720 --> 3:22:55.520]  last week talked about atrazine and most the water and how the EPA saying they can raise
[3:22:55.520 --> 3:22:59.360]  the level or I even test for even though admittedly there's always horrible things and then I'm
[3:22:59.360 --> 3:23:04.760]  reading this and yes 33% off Alexa pure raise high quality gravity fed filtration system
[3:23:04.760 --> 3:23:09.160]  at funds or operation everybody should get it but if everybody just filtered their water
[3:23:09.160 --> 3:23:14.080]  if all the listeners got this we'd have money to hire 500 reporters we'd be bigger than Fox
[3:23:14.080 --> 3:23:19.800]  News but a handful get it it's it's more than a pitch it's imperative that you get a filter
[3:23:19.800 --> 3:23:24.320]  system like this that cuts all the garbage out other systems don't do it info or store
[3:23:24.320 --> 3:23:31.040]  dot com I'm done talking about it fish holes about the cell out at 33% off it's there x
[3:23:31.040 --> 3:23:35.280]  twos back and stock the good halogen that's so good for your body pure iodine so the
[3:23:35.280 --> 3:23:41.440]  bad halogen family fluoride bromine all of that so Mike Adams takes over natural news
[3:23:41.440 --> 3:23:46.320]  dot com but the way they hide this in plain view because this article was in the local
[3:23:46.320 --> 3:23:50.360]  paper to a similar one about oh it's super toxic what we do where's all this fluoridated
[3:23:50.360 --> 3:23:55.400]  chemicals coming from it's the fluoride has the chemicals in it explain it to people you
[3:23:55.400 --> 3:23:59.960]  are real expert you've got one of the biggest toxicology labs in the country you're an engineer
[3:23:59.960 --> 3:24:04.000]  you're one of the leading experts on this what do you make of them trying to hide this
[3:24:04.000 --> 3:24:09.120]  in plain view what the hell is this we've got a big problem we need billion dollar scrubbers
[3:24:09.120 --> 3:24:12.160]  to cut out we don't know where the poison is coming from we've got all these deadly
[3:24:12.160 --> 3:24:17.800]  grenyard reagents heavy metals that have been fluoridated where's it coming from Mike so
[3:24:17.800 --> 3:24:23.560]  the bombshell headline for the day is Alex Jones knows more about environmental pollution
[3:24:23.560 --> 3:24:28.200]  than all the environmentalist people and groups out there I mean you are talking about the
[3:24:28.200 --> 3:24:33.160]  issues that they ignore they talk about fake issues they say carbon dioxide is bad but
[3:24:33.160 --> 3:24:37.760]  they ignore the heavy metals that are in the fluoride I've got big news to add to what you
[3:24:37.760 --> 3:24:41.680]  just said I mean you nailed it Alex in your previous segment as well you nailed it but
[3:24:41.680 --> 3:24:46.600]  it's even bigger than this it's not just that they can put toxic heavy metals and toxic
[3:24:46.600 --> 3:24:52.320]  chemicals in with fluoride and when they mix it together it becomes quote fluoride now
[3:24:52.320 --> 3:24:57.760]  it's no longer a toxin now it's fluoride and then they drip it into the water supply yes
[3:24:57.760 --> 3:25:03.520]  you're right about that but they also do it with bio sludge so they can take any toxin
[3:25:03.520 --> 3:25:09.680]  and flush it down the city sewers flush it down the drain and then that gets turned into
[3:25:09.680 --> 3:25:15.880]  nitrogen fertilizer that's dumped on nearby farms and school parks exactly I want to say
[3:25:15.880 --> 3:25:18.840]  how smart I want you to spend the whole thing on this I apologize jump it in but this is
[3:25:18.840 --> 3:25:23.800]  so incredible our jeb operator has worked a big TV all over the country he's super smart
[3:25:23.800 --> 3:25:29.560]  he needs a show he was saying Alex that's important and some other folks in the hall
[3:25:29.560 --> 3:25:34.680]  were saying but it's the it's the sewage Alex it's the sewage with the drugs and the chemicals
[3:25:34.680 --> 3:25:39.560]  and then you just said it they name it bio sludge but really all it is is the incredibly toxic
[3:25:39.560 --> 3:25:44.240]  stuff from the sewage plants and then they feed it to us again Mike it's all on purpose
[3:25:44.240 --> 3:25:49.440]  holy Toledo I'm sorry take over Mike multiple vectors of poison it's all deliberate and
[3:25:49.440 --> 3:25:55.400]  I'm not even done yet it's also so they take toxic drug runoff sludge and feed it to us
[3:25:55.400 --> 3:26:00.040]  and they admit that it's making the shrimp and fish kill themselves all right there's
[3:26:00.040 --> 3:26:06.120]  birth control drugs now in the fertilizer that goes on your food on the farms and and
[3:26:06.120 --> 3:26:11.920]  use I'm sorry to be explicit here but feminine hygiene products that get flushed down sewage
[3:26:11.920 --> 3:26:15.920]  they are found littered all over these farm fields where they dump the bio sludge from
[3:26:15.920 --> 3:26:22.360]  cities and all the virus and all the just oh my god yep and and guess what else they
[3:26:22.360 --> 3:26:28.000]  can take anything according to laws of Congress passed in the 1980s they can take anything
[3:26:28.000 --> 3:26:32.800]  and put it into a vaccine and call it a vaccine and the vaccine manufacturers are completely
[3:26:32.800 --> 3:26:39.120]  immune to any lawsuits well you know my dad told me about this when I was like 10 at the
[3:26:39.120 --> 3:26:45.240]  at the hardware store and he said son you know under laws they're allowed to take toxic
[3:26:45.240 --> 3:26:50.480]  waste and put it in fertilizer but it's not supposedly for crops but everybody uses it
[3:26:50.480 --> 3:26:55.560]  because it's 10% the cost he says you see how that says that right there and he and
[3:26:55.560 --> 3:27:01.920]  he showed me how it said not for crops that you know humans are going to be eating from
[3:27:01.920 --> 3:27:05.320]  but but but instead but that's where they put the toxic waste this is so incredible Mike
[3:27:05.320 --> 3:27:09.480]  I'm sorry take over well it's interesting from a government regulation standpoint you
[3:27:09.480 --> 3:27:14.760]  know we have a clean water act which of course the fluoride has an exception to that you
[3:27:14.760 --> 3:27:19.720]  know they're given waivers like you covered we have a clean air act but we don't have
[3:27:19.720 --> 3:27:24.200]  a clean soils act and so soils is where a lot of this pollution goes because there's
[3:27:24.200 --> 3:27:28.640]  no law against it they can literally take toxic heavy metals even radioactive waste
[3:27:28.640 --> 3:27:34.080]  biohazard waste you know hospital and we wonder why we drive through dusty weather you think
[3:27:34.080 --> 3:27:39.960]  it's pollen making you sick no it's the toxic clouds right that's right and then add on
[3:27:39.960 --> 3:27:46.680]  top of this the 5g electromagnetic radiation pollution so you see it is an assault and
[3:27:46.680 --> 3:27:52.040]  I'm going to talk about the coronavirus bioengineered weapons system also in an upcoming section
[3:27:52.040 --> 3:27:56.920]  here on your show Alex but these are multiple vectors of weapons systems that are targeting
[3:27:56.920 --> 3:28:01.560]  humanity this is so important can you come on early in the show tomorrow and get in the
[3:28:01.560 --> 3:28:05.160]  coronavirus because I know you're on the cutting edge of that or and the bio sludge and this
[3:28:05.160 --> 3:28:08.760]  huge fluoride development where they're now hiding in plain view because this is just
[3:28:08.760 --> 3:28:14.760]  incredible because again the alchemy they call toxic waste fluoride they call toxic sewage
[3:28:15.560 --> 3:28:22.200]  bio sludge I mean it's all a legalese game where they change the name the lobbyist they get
[3:28:22.200 --> 3:28:25.880]  congress to pass it like oh I can drink glasses around them here drink it lobbyist I'm not about
[3:28:25.880 --> 3:28:31.720]  to die you see and it's not only they're they're now putting they're going to they've legalized it
[3:28:31.720 --> 3:28:35.640]  in Washington state to put decomposed human beings into the bio sludge which goes into the
[3:28:35.640 --> 3:28:40.760]  food crops so this is you know full-on soylent green now emerging in our society full-on

[3:33:21.080 --> 3:33:26.120]  you for joining me um and just real quick just kind of a programming note i've had a lot of people
[3:33:26.120 --> 3:33:31.560]  calling and texting me concerned about the cyber attack on natural news our website is frozen
[3:33:31.560 --> 3:33:37.080]  we are unable to post new stories we have been subjected to a very sophisticated cyber attack
[3:33:37.800 --> 3:33:44.280]  that has put us into an emergency mode previous stories are available we've lost some stories
[3:33:44.280 --> 3:33:50.600]  basically we've been locked out of our own data not for any technical reason but for a social
[3:33:50.600 --> 3:33:55.640]  engineering reason i'll bring you more details as that unfolds we're working to solve the problem
[3:33:55.640 --> 3:34:00.520]  we appreciate your your prayers and your support we're working with attorneys as well but what we
[3:34:00.520 --> 3:34:07.320]  believe has happened just to summarize it is we believe that a cyber warfare group has impersonated
[3:34:07.320 --> 3:34:15.960]  federal agents to force our hosting provider to disconnect our data servers and that's that's a
[3:34:15.960 --> 3:34:21.320]  bombshell it's not a hundred percent confirmed but it's pointing in that direction at first i thought
[3:34:21.320 --> 3:34:26.840]  maybe it was the fbi trying to shut us down because we were reporting on the fbi running the white
[3:34:26.840 --> 3:34:31.880]  supremacist groups that you know were associated with uh governor northam's emergency order in
[3:34:31.880 --> 3:34:39.160]  virginia but now based on the evidence i'm seeing it it appears to be a cyber warfare group perhaps
[3:34:39.160 --> 3:34:45.000]  outside the united states that is impersonating agents of the federal government that is in
[3:34:45.000 --> 3:34:49.880]  engaged in this and clearly they have spent millions of dollars to try to take us down
[3:34:49.880 --> 3:34:53.960]  they haven't taken us offline but they have interrupted our news publishing so there will
[3:34:53.960 --> 3:34:58.600]  be no news from natural news for the next day or two maybe three i don't know how long this is
[3:34:58.600 --> 3:35:04.040]  going to take but i i appreciate your patience and i appreciate your support now getting to
[3:35:04.040 --> 3:35:08.440]  what alex and i were just talking about in the previous segment by the way just thank god for
[3:35:08.440 --> 3:35:14.600]  info wars right thank god that we have multiple platforms if if my site goes down alex has me
[3:35:14.600 --> 3:35:19.720]  on i can i can talk here if info wars were to go down it could come on natural news or bright
[3:35:19.720 --> 3:35:24.200]  town dot com or what have you and we've got band dot video as well and we keep posting new many
[3:35:24.200 --> 3:35:28.360]  documentaries there uh in fact over the last few days as well thank god we have all these
[3:35:28.360 --> 3:35:34.120]  platforms thank god we're we're willing to fight for our right to speak it and your right to be
[3:35:34.120 --> 3:35:39.560]  part of this conversation that's being banned by the tech giants they want to silence us by any
[3:35:39.560 --> 3:35:45.560]  means possible and yet here we are still fighting for america fighting for liberty fighting for the
[3:35:45.560 --> 3:35:50.120]  first amendment and the second amendment which reminds me by the way news i don't know if alex
[3:35:50.120 --> 3:35:54.760]  covered this but but yesterday it came out or maybe it was this morning that the democrats in
[3:35:54.760 --> 3:36:04.120]  virginia are now trying to ban criticism of democrat elected officials in virginia so under
[3:36:04.120 --> 3:36:11.960]  under this new law you would be criminally arrested for criticizing governor northam and calling him
[3:36:11.960 --> 3:36:17.320]  you know mr kuhn face baby killer or whatever you wanted to say uh and and he is that's what he is
[3:36:17.320 --> 3:36:23.960]  he's a psychopath in my view but you you would go to jail for doing that so not only is virginia
[3:36:23.960 --> 3:36:28.120]  trying to ban the second amendment but they're trying to ban the first amendment as well
[3:36:28.120 --> 3:36:33.480]  while creating you know kill zones kill zones for patriots where you're unarmed you're in a giant
[3:36:33.480 --> 3:36:38.280]  cage on the capital grounds and they put snipers on the roofs of the buildings all around you so
[3:36:38.280 --> 3:36:44.200]  they're creating a los vegas style kill zone where you are stuck in a cage a literal cage
[3:36:44.840 --> 3:36:49.720]  unarmed unable to defend yourself while governor northam says if you criticize him
[3:36:50.360 --> 3:36:55.160]  you're a criminal and this goes hand in hand with i mean look at the criminalization of journalism
[3:36:55.160 --> 3:36:59.400]  that is accelerating all around the world it's not just the attacks on me and natural news and
[3:36:59.400 --> 3:37:04.840]  alex jones and info wars and and other independent media sources i mean tom fitton from judicial watch
[3:37:04.840 --> 3:37:09.800]  his stream was taken down right side broadcasting was taken down yesterday from youtube but look
[3:37:09.800 --> 3:37:16.200]  at the intercepts glenn greenwald now facing a criminal charge from the government of brazil
[3:37:16.200 --> 3:37:24.360]  are you kidding me and and look at julian assange still being tortured absolutely tortured in prison
[3:37:24.360 --> 3:37:30.440]  for how many years has that gone on now i mean glenn greenwald you know he's not a trump supporter
[3:37:30.440 --> 3:37:35.160]  he's not a liberal he's not a conservative but i gotta tell you glenn greenwald is one of the best
[3:37:35.160 --> 3:37:39.720]  independent journalists operating in the world today and they're trying to criminalize him
[3:37:39.720 --> 3:37:46.360]  because he dares to conduct real journalism that's the you know that's his crime is engaging in
[3:37:46.360 --> 3:37:51.480]  journalism because if you ask questions then you are the enemy of the deep state you're the
[3:37:51.480 --> 3:37:55.800]  enemy of the globalists and they're coming for us all in one way or another they're trying to take
[3:37:55.800 --> 3:38:01.000]  us all down but they're trying to throw us all in jail and i agree with what alex has said
[3:38:01.000 --> 3:38:08.440]  day after day president trump you have got to pardon julian assange julian assange has done
[3:38:08.440 --> 3:38:16.200]  nothing wrong he is an innocent man he has been framed he has been tortured he has been destroyed
[3:38:16.200 --> 3:38:20.120]  by the deep state and they're trying to kill him i mean hillary clinton wanted to kill him with a
[3:38:20.120 --> 3:38:25.640]  with a drone strike i mean at least at least trump's drone strikes target terrorists where
[3:38:25.640 --> 3:38:29.240]  where you know the clinton's drone strikes target journalists you know that's i mean
[3:38:29.240 --> 3:38:36.040]  that's the difference right there but here we go we are doing our best to stay alive to stay
[3:38:36.040 --> 3:38:41.320]  active to stay safe to be viable and to stay online and and you look at info wars coverage
[3:38:41.320 --> 3:38:45.960]  of what's going on in washington dc and the women's march and the trial in the senate right now
[3:38:45.960 --> 3:38:51.080]  it is just top notch coverage and by the way if millie weaver needs to break in at any time
[3:38:51.080 --> 3:38:55.560]  we can cut to her if she's got any breaking news from dc so i don't want anybody to miss anything
[3:38:55.560 --> 3:39:00.520]  there but you know the work of ova shroyer and and you know i saw will johnson his video out there
[3:39:00.520 --> 3:39:05.720]  and millie and savannah and all the others that are there greg rees and so on just doing an incredible
[3:39:05.720 --> 3:39:12.280]  job even though info wars is just viciously attacked and smeared every single day but we
[3:39:12.280 --> 3:39:18.120]  are here for you so thank you for your support now i'm going to get into again more of what
[3:39:18.120 --> 3:39:25.480]  we were just talking about the fact is that leftists now are anti-environment that in fact
[3:39:25.480 --> 3:39:29.720]  democrats or these radical leftists i don't know what you call them anymore these anti-humanists
[3:39:30.600 --> 3:39:36.920]  they love toxic pesticides and herbicides we reached that point where you have you know
[3:39:36.920 --> 3:39:42.600]  david hog mocking alex jones for telling the truth about atrazine so is david hog pro atrazine
[3:39:43.480 --> 3:39:51.000]  you know is are they now going to be pro pesticide pro herbicide is david hog pro glyphosate
[3:39:51.000 --> 3:39:57.720]  as well you know pro organophosphates i don't know but if he's gonna mock alex jones for telling the
[3:39:57.720 --> 3:40:03.000]  truth about atrazine what does this mean about these leftists what about gretta thunberg she hasn't
[3:40:03.000 --> 3:40:08.280]  said a word about fluoride she not to my knowledge she hasn't said a word about bio sludge contamination
[3:40:08.280 --> 3:40:12.680]  and mass pollution through this so-called fertilizer that's spread on farms and put into the food
[3:40:12.680 --> 3:40:20.840]  supply that's made from the waste of every major city in america you know this practice of collecting
[3:40:20.840 --> 3:40:27.240]  all the human waste from all the sewage and and then dumping it on farms this practice is outlawed
[3:40:27.240 --> 3:40:34.280]  in many european countries but in america somehow we do it because pollution is never wrong and
[3:40:34.280 --> 3:40:39.880]  you know according to the left anyway and they say that pollution is good oh it's recycling
[3:40:39.880 --> 3:40:45.400]  it's recycling and now they pass a law in washington state where they can they can have
[3:40:45.400 --> 3:40:51.720]  decomposed human bodies so instead of being cremated or buried you can be mixed with chemicals
[3:40:51.720 --> 3:40:59.240]  and flush down the drain and added to the bio sludge that is then dumped on the food crops so
[3:41:00.200 --> 3:41:06.440]  food that you eat that's grown in washington state the orchards the apples and pears and i don't
[3:41:06.440 --> 3:41:11.560]  know what else they have there but they grow a lot of food in rural washington state if it's not
[3:41:11.560 --> 3:41:19.560]  organic there is a chance that it could have been quote fertilized with dead dissolved humans
[3:41:19.560 --> 3:41:25.560]  and and human waste and everything that's flushed down the toilet because that is what is put on
[3:41:25.560 --> 3:41:31.240]  croplands in america and there's not a single environmentalist that i know of that is speaking
[3:41:31.240 --> 3:41:36.120]  out about this not a single one they'll tell you all day oh we're going to die because the oceans
[3:41:36.120 --> 3:41:42.120]  are going to rise in the year 2150 or something and then you look at the oceans they're not rising
[3:41:42.120 --> 3:41:46.440]  you look at the glaciers they're doing fine they're not even melting in many cases some are getting
[3:41:46.440 --> 3:41:51.480]  bigger you know the temperature data are all faked by the left because they have to have to create
[3:41:51.480 --> 3:41:57.240]  this narrative that's not even true but leftists are freaked out about things that aren't real
[3:41:57.240 --> 3:42:01.800]  and then they ignore the things that are real they ignore the bio sludge pollution they ignore the
[3:42:01.800 --> 3:42:08.680]  real chemical contamination and then guess what birth defects happen cancer happens people lose
[3:42:08.680 --> 3:42:14.120]  their minds people's brains are poisoned and contaminated and that causes them to go insane
[3:42:14.120 --> 3:42:18.040]  where they can't even participate in democracy and they end up voting for a democrat you know
[3:42:18.040 --> 3:42:22.360]  or just crapping all over the streets in san francisco or maybe both i think san francisco is
[3:42:22.360 --> 3:42:26.840]  the only city where you can vote and then crap on the street where you just voted you know back to
[3:42:26.840 --> 3:42:34.200]  back it's it's an amazing feat for for a city tied to nancy pelosi i mean oh oh my goodness and
[3:42:34.200 --> 3:42:38.600]  what's wrong with her brain has she had too much bio sludge i think so maybe too much fluoride maybe
[3:42:38.600 --> 3:42:43.320]  both something's wrong something's wrong with her something's wrong with these liberal cities
[3:42:43.320 --> 3:42:46.760]  that we'll be back with more here on info wars.com this is mike adam stay with us

[3:45:20.840 --> 3:45:25.480]  wars boosting our economy speaking out against communist china trump's been doing an amazing
[3:45:25.480 --> 3:45:31.960]  job but now more than ever we really have to realize that we're being targeted because we are
[3:45:31.960 --> 3:45:38.040]  effective and the globalists are beginning to lose their war against humanity in a big way
[3:45:38.040 --> 3:45:42.600]  and so we're going to see some major fireworks out of them but it's critical to not let ourselves
[3:45:42.600 --> 3:45:49.000]  get down when we see all the poison they spray at us that's an attempt to moralize us we've got
[3:45:49.000 --> 3:45:55.080]  to remember that and stay focused and stay happy with the daily wear and tear of the environment
[3:45:55.080 --> 3:46:01.960]  on our skin it's only natural that it starts to crack and take damage wind heat water and age

[3:46:57.800 --> 3:47:19.640]  you found it the tip of the spear it is the alex joneshow with mike adams
[3:47:21.640 --> 3:47:25.160]  all right welcome back mike adams here info wars dot com we're going to talk about the exploding
[3:47:25.160 --> 3:47:31.800]  pandemic of the corona virus right now uh there's a lot of breaking news on this china has quarantine
[3:47:31.800 --> 3:47:37.240]  is quarantined a city of 11 million people we have a confirmed case in the united states
[3:47:37.880 --> 3:47:46.680]  we have an estimated 20 000 possible infections based on a projection of one one analysis of
[3:47:46.680 --> 3:47:52.040]  reported cases projecting it to unreported cases uh that's conjecture it may be true uh
[3:47:52.040 --> 3:47:56.840]  maybe a high number maybe a low number but we have incubation periods that are unknown for
[3:47:56.840 --> 3:48:04.840]  this corona virus uh and yet we have international flights still leaving the wuhan airport in china
[3:48:04.840 --> 3:48:11.000]  because of chinese new year and to all my freedom loving friends in hong kong and taiwan
[3:48:11.000 --> 3:48:17.400]  uh xin yan kwai le or kwai le xin yan kwai le uh that means happy new year in chinese if i could
[3:48:17.400 --> 3:48:23.560]  get the intonation correct uh and and by the way love all all of you in hong kong freedom lovers
[3:48:23.560 --> 3:48:30.520]  there and all your freedom lovers in taiwan and congratulations on the victory of your your president
[3:48:30.520 --> 3:48:35.800]  for reelection we hope to achieve the same pro freedom victory of our president for reelection
[3:48:35.800 --> 3:48:41.000]  here as well the bullying of china will not succeed against the freedom loving citizens of taiwan
[3:48:41.000 --> 3:48:48.280]  and hong kong however china is becoming an incubation factory for this corona virus this is
[3:48:48.280 --> 3:48:53.480]  the next pandemic that is already starting to cause some panic around the world as it appears to be
[3:48:53.480 --> 3:48:58.520]  spreading there's another case of a 57 year old man that was found near the mexico border he had
[3:48:58.520 --> 3:49:05.720]  traveled to beijing as well as the wuhan region in china and uh he's he's believed to be infected
[3:49:05.720 --> 3:49:10.840]  with this virus as well it's only a matter of time before this spreads to other cities because now you
[3:49:10.840 --> 3:49:18.440]  have chinese new year patrons from china traveling to japan and korea and the philippines uh malaysia
[3:49:18.440 --> 3:49:24.600]  tailand australia and many other places throughout southeast asia and even of course canada and you
[3:49:24.600 --> 3:49:30.760]  know toronto and and north america as well so you're gonna you're gonna see this spread now what's
[3:49:30.760 --> 3:49:38.600]  interesting and alex pointed this out earlier is that a the fda has approved apparently a vaccine
[3:49:38.600 --> 3:49:45.720]  just recently for this particular strain of corona virus and that vaccine i mean imagine the timing
[3:49:45.720 --> 3:49:50.760]  of this so you have a vaccine that comes out just as the the pandemic of this weaponized
[3:49:50.760 --> 3:49:55.720]  virus begins to spread and yes i believe it's weaponized because it achieved first animal to
[3:49:55.720 --> 3:50:01.160]  human transmission and then human to human transmission that's pretty difficult for a natural
[3:50:01.160 --> 3:50:07.000]  virus to achieve on its own so quickly it's possible but it's difficult the speed of these
[3:50:07.000 --> 3:50:14.680]  mutations and adaptation into cross species life forms is an indication of its likely origins as a
[3:50:14.680 --> 3:50:19.160]  bioengineered weapon and we know that of course governments of the world including the united
[3:50:19.160 --> 3:50:23.800]  states even though treaties prevented have been engaged in bioweapons development and the way they
[3:50:23.800 --> 3:50:30.920]  do it is they run offsite bioweapons uh headquarters essentially and in the united states we run
[3:50:30.920 --> 3:50:37.480]  bioweapons development in guess where africa yes how do you think uh ebola keeps escaping
[3:50:37.480 --> 3:50:42.120]  and and hitting different tribes there in africa uh because they're testing it by the way they're
[3:50:42.120 --> 3:50:49.640]  they're trying to see what happens with this strain you know ebola 42 ebola 43 ebola revision 44
[3:50:49.640 --> 3:50:53.960]  they're they're testing the different strains to see what happens and they're looking to fine tune
[3:50:53.960 --> 3:51:01.560]  a very specific combination of latency or incubation in the human organism they want a very long
[3:51:01.560 --> 3:51:08.360]  latency followed by a very devastating payload upon activation which is a very high fatality rate
[3:51:08.360 --> 3:51:14.440]  and the challenge and one of the reasons why i can speak about this as a scientist uh you know
[3:51:14.440 --> 3:51:17.320]  i think this is one of the reasons why i'm being censored so aggressively is because
[3:51:17.320 --> 3:51:22.200]  i i work in a lab and i can talk about this but normally balancing those two things if you're
[3:51:22.200 --> 3:51:26.520]  trying to engineer a bioweapon is very very difficult typically viruses that have very high
[3:51:26.520 --> 3:51:31.480]  fatality rates also tend to have very short incubation periods it's not always the case but
[3:51:31.480 --> 3:51:37.720]  that's the trend so what what they the globalists the anti-human population globalists have managed
[3:51:37.720 --> 3:51:45.720]  to engineer it appears is a very long incubation period during which the patient is asymptomatic
[3:51:45.720 --> 3:51:52.840]  meaning they can't be diagnosed with this devastating virus and then when the symptoms hit
[3:51:52.840 --> 3:51:58.360]  they hit hard and aggressively and they can overwhelm the patient and the fatality rate
[3:51:58.920 --> 3:52:04.520]  can be quite devastating now right now for this particular virus the reported fatality rate is
[3:52:04.520 --> 3:52:11.560]  relatively low something like under five percent at the moment but that's just early data and that
[3:52:11.560 --> 3:52:19.240]  may change and also the virus may adapt to the human organism and become more fatal there's
[3:52:19.240 --> 3:52:24.440]  another theory in all of this in the weaponization development sector so to speak is that this can
[3:52:24.440 --> 3:52:30.120]  be part of a binary weapon system so that this virus may be further weaponized through interaction
[3:52:30.120 --> 3:52:34.120]  with certain chemicals that are put into the food supplies such as hormone disruptors
[3:52:34.120 --> 3:52:38.280]  hormone mimicers or pesticides herbicides things that we've talked about before
[3:52:38.280 --> 3:52:42.760]  or in the presence of certain fluorinated chemicals for example that that's put into the
[3:52:42.760 --> 3:52:47.960]  water supply in the United States so just because a virus is killing people by itself
[3:52:48.520 --> 3:52:54.600]  doesn't mean that it can't kill a lot more people in conjunction with other vectors of depopulation
[3:52:54.600 --> 3:53:00.840]  that are also being just released upon humanity including 5 5g and you look at the electromagnetic
[3:53:00.840 --> 3:53:06.680]  pollution and what that does to human neurology and how that impacts in fact what's called the
[3:53:06.680 --> 3:53:13.160]  ion gated calcium channels so when you're exposed to this 5g radiation it changes the permeability
[3:53:13.160 --> 3:53:19.720]  of the cell membranes in your body and it causes calcium ions to be pushed into the cells at
[3:53:19.720 --> 3:53:24.920]  concentrations that are toxic and in some cases even fatal and this was why there are documented
[3:53:24.920 --> 3:53:31.480]  effects of 5g exposure that include neuropsychiatric effects which means it alters your personality
[3:53:31.480 --> 3:53:39.320]  it changes your brain function your behavior your reaction to reality it's literal brain control
[3:53:39.320 --> 3:53:45.160]  now can that interact with a viral strain or you know RNA fragments from viral strains that
[3:53:45.160 --> 3:53:50.920]  are now spreading in the wild yes perhaps there's a technology called RNA interference technology
[3:53:50.920 --> 3:53:56.600]  that has been developed in fact by the pesticide manufacturers in order to kill pests who are
[3:53:56.600 --> 3:54:02.280]  eating food crops RNA interference technology uses protein fragments to target specific
[3:54:02.280 --> 3:54:06.840]  physiological functions of the human body they can target your reproductive capabilities where
[3:54:06.840 --> 3:54:12.440]  they can target neurological function so they can literally retard your brain function through
[3:54:12.440 --> 3:54:18.600]  this RNA interference technology so i'm kind of giving you a a combination a cocktail of all
[3:54:18.600 --> 3:54:23.160]  of the available weapon systems that these mad scientists have at their disposal that may be
[3:54:23.160 --> 3:54:28.920]  related to this outbreak of this coronavirus coming from well reportedly china but probably
[3:54:28.920 --> 3:54:34.040]  it was just released in china it probably came from a lab by a government you know somewhere
[3:54:34.040 --> 3:54:38.680]  else and then it was just released in beijing or released in wuhan province or somewhere else like
[3:54:38.680 --> 3:54:45.560]  that so uh the bottom line the big picture folks is that humanities under attack the globalists
[3:54:45.560 --> 3:54:51.960]  and the deep state have declared war on humanity they hate human life that's this is why they kill
[3:54:51.960 --> 3:54:56.680]  babies and that's why they celebrate killing babies they hate human liberty human freedom
[3:54:56.680 --> 3:55:01.560]  they hate human ingenuity that's why they're anti free market they hate human creativity which is
[3:55:01.560 --> 3:55:07.080]  why they demand absolute obedience and no diversity of thought you know diversity of thought is banned
[3:55:07.080 --> 3:55:13.000]  on youtube and facebook and everywhere else you must comply and conform to their obedient demands of
[3:55:13.000 --> 3:55:19.480]  what you're allowed to think or speak or read or watch or report and if you you go outside those
[3:55:19.480 --> 3:55:23.480]  boundaries then of course you're banned and you're called an evil person and you're censored like
[3:55:23.480 --> 3:55:28.680]  like we're being censored today you're attacked just viciously smeared and silenced so this
[3:55:29.640 --> 3:55:35.320]  all of this is related none of none of what you're seeing right now is an accident and it's only
[3:55:35.320 --> 3:55:41.560]  going to get worse they are going to release more weapons whether biological or chemical or
[3:55:41.560 --> 3:55:47.560]  radiological or self replicating systems more weapons will be released there will be more
[3:55:47.560 --> 3:55:54.280]  human weapons carrying the biological weapons into the united states crossing the open border
[3:55:54.280 --> 3:56:01.400]  arriving via air travel or being planted in cities across america as the state department has done
[3:56:01.400 --> 3:56:06.280]  for many years in order to try to you know put ebola in american cities like austin texas for
[3:56:06.280 --> 3:56:13.560]  example we are suffering an invasion we are under attack humanity is on the brink and yet
[3:56:13.560 --> 3:56:18.440]  the very voices that are working to protect and save humanity are the voices that are targeted
[3:56:18.440 --> 3:56:24.760]  in silence and that's why your support for info wars dot com is absolutely crucial support this
[3:56:24.760 --> 3:56:30.200]  network i do as well as you know that's why i'm here support info wars dot com check out info
[3:56:30.200 --> 3:56:35.560]  wars store dot com if you're not getting an air filter and a water filter and and using those
[3:56:35.560 --> 3:56:41.000]  daily you're crazy seriously you're you're crazy if you're drinking tap water it's like a slow
[3:56:41.000 --> 3:56:45.800]  it's like a slow suicide if you're breathing indoor air in your house without filtering it
[3:56:46.360 --> 3:56:52.760]  you are breathing the dust that's blown off the bio sludge farms and the glyphosate spraying of
[3:56:52.760 --> 3:56:58.200]  farms that could be miles away you're inhaling glyphosate if you're not using an air filter
[3:56:59.000 --> 3:57:05.480]  the world is being made toxic on purpose but you have means to protect yourself are you using
[3:57:05.480 --> 3:57:11.160]  those means if not then you're on a suicide mission and i don't think you are i think you want to
