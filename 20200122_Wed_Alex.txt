[00:00:10.077 --> 00:00:14.920]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic.
[00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:24.426]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:00:24.426 --> 00:00:34.732]  We're here to take on the anti-human, blood-sucking, pedophile, vampire, New World Order trash.
[00:00:34.732 --> 00:00:38.735]  We've come to chew bubble gum and to kick ass.
[00:00:40.174 --> 00:00:41.694]  And guess what?
[00:00:41.694 --> 00:00:46.556]  I'm all out of bubble gum, to quote the great Rowdy Rowdy Piper, a patriot and listener of this show.
[00:00:46.556 --> 00:00:51.077]  It's to show how popular freedom is.
[00:00:51.077 --> 00:00:58.139]  Well, I gotta tell ya, to say that Infowars is on fire is an understatement.
[00:00:58.139 --> 00:01:04.041]  If we were fire, we'd be squared.
[00:01:04.041 --> 00:01:04.621]  Next level.
[00:01:05.817 --> 00:01:13.121]  All the years, all the preparation, all the building, all the tribulations have only made us battle-hardened.
[00:01:13.121 --> 00:01:21.226]  And every reporter and the crew and the security people has just done a 100% job.
[00:01:21.226 --> 00:01:27.930]  Everything fell into place and everything we did was wildly successful and game-changing and national news.
[00:01:29.215 --> 00:01:34.081]  Taking over deep state narratives that gun owners were going to cause a giant murderous bloodbath.
[00:01:34.081 --> 00:01:40.749]  Turned it around on them, educated the folks about how the governor was trying to cause a false flag and coming for people's guns.
[00:01:40.749 --> 00:01:44.955]  Same thing happened with the Women's March, how it's run by Soros, how it's meant to divide the family.
[00:01:44.955 --> 00:01:47.898]  We totally took that over and got the majority of the coverage.
[00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:51.419]  A hundred million bucks Soros spent on that, he admits.
[00:01:51.419 --> 00:01:52.840]  We took it over.
[00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:53.580]  Boom!
[00:01:53.580 --> 00:02:02.441]  During the whole kickoff of the trial, InfoWars is on the ground showing how the anti-Trump demonstrators don't even know who they are.
[00:02:02.441 --> 00:02:05.342]  They're there, they're paid, they're astroturfed, they admit it.
[00:02:05.342 --> 00:02:07.522]  That's been national news.
[00:02:07.522 --> 00:02:18.104]  I've just got to say, the listeners, the viewers, the supporters have provisioned us, have supported us, have given us the intel, have given us the prayers, and you have put us on the field.
[00:02:19.674 --> 00:02:24.928]  And as the late, great Theodore Roosevelt said,
[00:02:25.925 --> 00:02:35.730]  A man in the arena, even if he fails, at least failed while trying and daring greatly, will never be amongst those timid spectators who only make comments from the stands.
[00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:39.472]  But when you dare and dare greatly and win, it is legend.
[00:02:39.472 --> 00:02:42.994]  And I can tell you right now, they could wipe us out next week.
[00:02:42.994 --> 00:02:45.495]  And what we've done has already been legend together.
[00:02:45.495 --> 00:02:50.118]  That means you, the viewers and listeners, are literally this operation.
[00:02:50.118 --> 00:02:51.118]  And we have done this.
[00:02:51.118 --> 00:02:52.519]  You have done this.
[00:02:52.519 --> 00:02:53.920]  And so I salute you.
[00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:55.940]  And I thank you all.
[00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:57.781]  Now we've got some big challenges coming up.
[00:02:57.781 --> 00:03:01.101]  We're going to break it down on the next segment.
[00:03:01.101 --> 00:03:04.642]  I'm going to read that Man in Arena quote since they put up on screen here in a moment.
[00:03:04.642 --> 00:03:10.004]  But the curveball is the stock market and could they crash it to take Trump out?
[00:03:10.004 --> 00:03:13.904]  The other big curveball is this coronavirus.
[00:03:13.904 --> 00:03:24.407]  Did you know just a month and four days ago it got patented and certified with a vaccine
[00:03:26.144 --> 00:03:33.568]  And lo and behold, the exact same virus pops up about a week later and starts spreading.
[00:03:33.568 --> 00:03:36.389]  That's just amazing, isn't it?
[00:03:36.389 --> 00:03:41.432]  They just approved live Ebola vaccine as well, so get ready for the fun there.
[00:03:41.432 --> 00:03:43.173]  That's coming up.
[00:03:43.173 --> 00:03:44.814]  Just so much to break down.
[00:03:44.814 --> 00:03:46.835]  Now Brazil is going after
[00:03:47.575 --> 00:03:48.675]  Glenn Greenwald.
[00:03:48.675 --> 00:03:49.216]  Why not?
[00:03:49.216 --> 00:03:51.016]  America's not standing up for Julian Assange.
[00:03:51.016 --> 00:03:52.076]  Very dangerous.
[00:03:52.076 --> 00:03:58.498]  A real black mark on the leader of Brazil and on Trump that he's done nothing so far.
[00:03:58.498 --> 00:03:59.218]  Really a problem.
[00:03:59.218 --> 00:04:02.039]  But let's end this segment with something positive.
[00:04:02.039 --> 00:04:02.840]  The man in the arena.
[00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:04.120]  Back on screen please if you can.
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:10.785]  Because I don't want to butcher what Mr. Roosevelt had to say.
[00:04:10.785 --> 00:04:18.111]  It is not the critic who counts, not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles or where the doer of deeds could have done them better.
[00:04:18.111 --> 00:04:23.615]  The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust, sweat, and blood.
[00:04:23.615 --> 00:04:26.778]  And then it goes on to the rest of the quote.
[00:04:26.778 --> 00:04:28.179]  But that really does say it all.
[00:04:28.179 --> 00:04:30.401]  And Infowars is in the arena.
[00:04:31.121 --> 00:04:39.287]  I mean, whenever Michael Savage came on, he doesn't do other people's shows, he said, Alex Jones, you are the gladiator.
[00:04:39.287 --> 00:04:51.916]  Because I fight every day in the arena, but it's the audience, it's the crew, it's the people that make all this possible that truly are the individuals in the arena.
[00:04:51.916 --> 00:04:57.500]  So it's all coming up today on this live Wednesday, January 22nd transmission.
[00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:00.242]  Hey, you there.
[00:05:01.308 --> 00:05:03.009]  We have a problem.
[00:05:03.009 --> 00:05:05.832]  You see, there is a baby.
[00:05:05.832 --> 00:05:09.715]  The mother of this baby is not sure she's ready.
[00:05:09.715 --> 00:05:13.838]  The father of this baby doesn't want to settle down.
[00:05:13.838 --> 00:05:16.620]  The mother starts to have regrets.
[00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:20.403]  The father considers leaving town.
[00:05:20.403 --> 00:05:23.745]  But a friend says there's a solution.
[00:05:23.745 --> 00:05:26.688]  She says to have an abortion.
[00:05:27.861 --> 00:05:29.763]  The mother decides to look into it.
[00:05:29.763 --> 00:05:32.845]  The clinic assures her it's safe.
[00:05:32.845 --> 00:05:34.627]  She's made her decision.
[00:05:34.627 --> 00:05:37.129]  She's going to have an abortion.
[00:05:37.129 --> 00:05:40.372]  The problem is, that baby is you.
[00:05:43.396 --> 00:05:52.423]  Join me, Owen Schroyer, at the March for Life, Friday, January 24th, in Washington, D.C., noon, at the National Mall.
[00:05:52.423 --> 00:05:53.564]  I'll see you there.
[00:05:53.564 --> 00:05:56.026]  It's time to stand up for the unborn.
[00:05:56.026 --> 00:05:58.007]  It's time to speak out for the voiceless.
[00:06:28.676 --> 00:06:34.459]  We are back live, ladies and gentlemen, broadcasting worldwide.
[00:06:34.459 --> 00:06:42.443]  And I am your host, Alex Jones, and we are going to be here live, Lord willing,
[00:06:51.815 --> 00:07:15.716]  For the next four hours and then Owen Schroyer from DC with Savannah Hernandez and the rest of the crew will be hosting things live and anytime there's anything interesting we're watching with the entire kickoff of day two of the Trump Trump Senate we will be covering it live here on air but we also have live feeds at band.video whenever we go live on our own platform.
[00:07:16.764 --> 00:07:25.432]  on our own system so that it's much harder for the establishment to shut us down and much harder for the system to block us.
[00:07:25.432 --> 00:07:29.356]  There's a big story up on Infowars.com.
[00:07:29.356 --> 00:07:33.660]  Also, the Gateway Pundit and many others picked it up.
[00:07:33.660 --> 00:07:34.861]  Stunning!
[00:07:34.861 --> 00:07:40.146]  YouTube takes down Judicial Watch and right-side broadcasting impeachment feed.
[00:07:41.772 --> 00:07:44.095]  Want to drive viewers to liberal feeds?
[00:07:44.095 --> 00:07:45.317]  Well, it's worse than that.
[00:07:45.317 --> 00:07:52.627]  Breitbart is reporting that their pro-gun feeds, just showing the speeches in the rally from Virginia, were killed.
[00:07:53.905 --> 00:08:01.728]  This is even when Judicial Watch and Rightside pay, as part of the pool, to have a network feed.
[00:08:01.728 --> 00:08:05.410]  You can pay $100, $500, $10,000 for an NFL feed.
[00:08:05.410 --> 00:08:08.611]  You can't lease that.
[00:08:08.611 --> 00:08:19.416]  But almost all feeds you can pay, and depending on how valuable they think they are, and who you are, who you're going to feed it to, by law they have to basically license it to you.
[00:08:19.416 --> 00:08:20.777]  Well, they went and
[00:08:21.617 --> 00:08:27.939]  Leased the feeds from Congress, from C-SPAN, that oversees that.
[00:08:27.939 --> 00:08:30.479]  That's why you'll look at ABC, CBS, NBC, Fox.
[00:08:30.479 --> 00:08:35.040]  It's the same shot of a State of the Union as the cameras cut around.
[00:08:35.040 --> 00:08:37.781]  Well, imagine you go lease that.
[00:08:37.781 --> 00:08:39.241]  You go pay for that.
[00:08:39.241 --> 00:08:42.522]  We've done it before ourselves at events.
[00:08:42.522 --> 00:08:45.583]  And YouTube and others just say, no.
[00:08:46.351 --> 00:08:54.101]  We're not going to let you lease a feed and pick up the feed and run it.
[00:08:54.101 --> 00:08:56.844]  They call it fake news.
[00:08:56.844 --> 00:09:02.050]  They described it as violating community standards.
[00:09:03.737 --> 00:09:08.421]  So those are NationalFile.com and GatewayPundit.com articles on that.
[00:09:08.421 --> 00:09:16.747]  And I just keep warning everybody, Judicial Watch is a powerful group of lawyers that have done an amazing job exposing the deep state.
[00:09:16.747 --> 00:09:30.898]  And the deep state is so arrogant and so brazen that they believe that they can take Judicial Watch's feed away.
[00:09:30.898 --> 00:09:32.860]  So two years ago, it's Alex Jones.
[00:09:35.188 --> 00:09:39.149]  And now it's judicial watch.
[00:09:39.149 --> 00:09:45.390]  See, big tech doesn't care if you sue them because Google's worth almost a trillion dollars.
[00:09:45.390 --> 00:09:47.511]  Apple's worth more than a trillion dollars.
[00:09:47.511 --> 00:09:49.571]  Tesla's worth over a hundred billion dollars.
[00:09:49.571 --> 00:09:52.092]  The system doesn't care.
[00:09:52.092 --> 00:10:01.534]  It's like when AP ran, then I lost a lawsuit for writing a book called Nobody Died at Sandy Hook, which I never wrote or am in.
[00:10:01.534 --> 00:10:03.835]  And we had lawyers call them and they just said, sue us.
[00:10:05.077 --> 00:10:07.038]  We had letters sent, and they said, sue us!
[00:10:07.038 --> 00:10:07.458]  We don't care!
[00:10:07.458 --> 00:10:11.880]  Because I can fight them for two, three years, spend millions of dollars, and win millions.
[00:10:11.880 --> 00:10:13.181]  They don't care.
[00:10:13.181 --> 00:10:18.363]  They'll just pay it out.
[00:10:18.363 --> 00:10:21.425]  That's a dangerous situation, isn't it?
[00:10:21.425 --> 00:10:23.546]  And Congress and the President need to act.
[00:10:23.546 --> 00:10:24.907]  My God.
[00:10:24.907 --> 00:10:29.789]  Mitch McConnell had people at his house say, we're going to kill you, Nazi turtle.
[00:10:29.789 --> 00:10:31.230]  We're going to stab you.
[00:10:32.461 --> 00:10:33.562]  And Twitter let them do it.
[00:10:33.562 --> 00:10:37.864]  Well, Mitch McConnell's own site pointed out it was wrong, his own Twitter.
[00:10:37.864 --> 00:10:42.206]  They deleted his comment and shut his Twitter down for a couple days.
[00:10:42.206 --> 00:10:44.707]  Did Turtle do anything?
[00:10:44.707 --> 00:10:45.928]  No, he didn't do anything.
[00:10:45.928 --> 00:10:52.371]  And that's dangerous because modern communication is Facebook, is YouTube, is Twitter, is Instagram.
[00:10:52.371 --> 00:10:54.212]  It's how almost everybody communicates now.
[00:10:54.212 --> 00:10:55.813]  People don't pick a telephone up.
[00:10:55.813 --> 00:10:58.835]  Most people, including myself, don't even
[00:11:00.520 --> 00:11:03.843]  Pick the phone up, you just send a text message.
[00:11:03.843 --> 00:11:06.485]  Or you send a voice message.
[00:11:06.485 --> 00:11:08.426]  That's how most communication is now.
[00:11:08.426 --> 00:11:14.091]  And now, CNN member six months ago said, we're looking into banning Jones off of text messages.
[00:11:14.091 --> 00:11:16.933]  We're trying to find out what platform he's on.
[00:11:16.933 --> 00:11:18.654]  If he's using WhatsApp.
[00:11:18.654 --> 00:11:21.556]  And then Facebook came out and said, no, we checked, he doesn't.
[00:11:21.556 --> 00:11:24.759]  But if he tries to use private messenger with us, we'll ban him there.
[00:11:24.759 --> 00:11:25.760]  And now Brazil.
[00:11:27.728 --> 00:11:33.272]  Facebook is using it to block people there that support Balasaro.
[00:11:33.272 --> 00:11:34.372]  Balasaro doesn't even get it.
[00:11:34.372 --> 00:11:37.495]  He's trying to have Greenwald put in prison for journalism.
[00:11:37.495 --> 00:11:39.836]  So, this is a dangerous situation.
[00:11:39.836 --> 00:11:45.120]  And violations of free speech and violations of communication run across party lines worldwide.
[00:11:45.120 --> 00:11:46.741]  Republican, Democrat, liberal, conservative.
[00:11:48.237 --> 00:11:48.978]  We're good to go.
[00:12:07.108 --> 00:12:11.871]  On a Breitbart, or an InfoWars, or a RightSide, or a Judicial Watch.
[00:12:11.871 --> 00:12:21.798]  Because see, in the modern age, everybody's figuring out, wait a minute, I can just pay a couple hundred bucks to C-SPAN, or to Congress, and they'll just give me the fee?
[00:12:21.798 --> 00:12:24.040]  And then I can carry it?
[00:12:24.040 --> 00:12:26.282]  And CNN is always behind the censorship.
[00:12:26.282 --> 00:12:36.309]  You know it was Oliver Darcy, or one of those guys, called up YouTube and said, because they've got the contacts at the top of it, and said, what are you doing letting Judicial Watch run this?
[00:12:38.643 --> 00:12:45.508]  Just like they did to us, because they don't want after hours of coverage to cut to Judicial Watch's commentary.
[00:12:45.508 --> 00:12:48.010]  They want you to only see CNN's commentary.
[00:12:48.010 --> 00:12:49.290]  And it's racketeering.
[00:12:49.290 --> 00:12:50.491]  It's organized crime.
[00:12:50.491 --> 00:12:58.877]  If any other group was organized with another business to shut down everybody else and coordinating to do it, they'd be shut down for monopolistic practices.
[00:12:58.877 --> 00:13:00.698]  They'd have injunctions filed on their ass.
[00:13:00.698 --> 00:13:05.922]  They'd end up in prison for criminal racketeering.
[00:13:05.922 --> 00:13:07.103]  But because they're big tech,
[00:13:09.005 --> 00:13:16.808]  And because everybody's laid down to him so long, it's thought that it's a precedent that you just have to kiss their ass and lay down to them and let them do whatever they want forever.
[00:13:16.808 --> 00:13:25.491]  And they're just gonna keep pushing and pushing and pushing until they completely take over or we turn the tide.
[00:13:25.491 --> 00:13:31.813]  But Trump is being lied to and bamboozled by big tech that he has dinner with, they lie to his face, and it's a load of crap.
[00:13:34.377 --> 00:13:36.858]  Tim Cook is not Donald Trump's friend.
[00:13:36.858 --> 00:13:39.380]  My God, the man runs the worst slave factories in China.
[00:13:39.380 --> 00:13:42.521]  I'm going to stop there and tell you what's coming up.
[00:13:42.521 --> 00:13:43.782]  It's confirmed.
[00:13:43.782 --> 00:13:45.103]  No one's reporting this.
[00:13:45.103 --> 00:13:48.945]  We're going to break it at the bottom of the hour.
[00:13:48.945 --> 00:13:54.348]  The coronavirus, it was patented, certified for and authorizes a vaccine 30
[00:13:58.049 --> 00:13:59.331]  Four days ago.
[00:13:59.331 --> 00:14:01.553]  And magically that's right after that happens.
[00:14:01.553 --> 00:14:02.755]  There's an outbreak.
[00:14:02.755 --> 00:14:05.058]  Not saying anything's going on here.
[00:14:05.058 --> 00:14:07.200]  I'm just saying two plus two sometimes equals four.
[00:14:07.200 --> 00:14:08.682]  Just sometimes.
[00:14:08.682 --> 00:14:16.973]  And you know, ducks quack and fish live in the water and birds fly in the sky and bats hang upside down and bananas are yellow.
[00:14:20.655 --> 00:14:23.876]  Then it got there's another one got patented actually last month.
[00:14:23.876 --> 00:14:26.577]  So this is very, very serious situation.
[00:14:26.577 --> 00:14:32.919]  We're going to be laying it all out and breaking it all down here today.
[00:14:32.919 --> 00:14:36.340]  Please remember that without you, this dog doesn't hunt.
[00:14:36.340 --> 00:14:37.780]  With your help and support, it does.
[00:14:37.780 --> 00:14:39.641]  And right now we need financial support.
[00:14:39.641 --> 00:14:42.882]  Plus, we have products you really need regardless.
[00:14:42.882 --> 00:14:43.182]  And so
[00:14:44.383 --> 00:14:45.844]  Fish oil came back in.
[00:14:45.844 --> 00:14:46.966]  It's ultimate fish oil.
[00:14:46.966 --> 00:14:54.012]  It's the cleanest, best salmon with high quality anchovy and with the best krill oil all in one.
[00:14:54.012 --> 00:14:55.814]  And it is the very best formula you can find.
[00:14:55.814 --> 00:15:00.799]  And it doesn't have any mercury and it goes through the expensive process of naturally removing that without damaging the oil.
[00:15:00.799 --> 00:15:01.620]  And it's going to sell out!
[00:15:01.960 --> 00:15:09.506]  But I'm going to still keep it at 33% off for another week or so, and then we'll put it back to full price, because it'll be a few more months until it comes back in.
[00:15:09.506 --> 00:15:13.529]  So we'll take advantage of the ultimate fish oil and try that out for your heart, your body, your mind.
[00:15:13.529 --> 00:15:15.010]  I sleep better on it.
[00:15:15.010 --> 00:15:17.132]  Talk about a nootropic.
[00:15:17.132 --> 00:15:23.197]  It just makes everything, when you take it with X2, X3, things like TurboForce, BrainForce, it just makes it better.
[00:15:23.937 --> 00:15:29.003]  And ultimate fish oil, ladies and gentlemen, is something I take in the morning and in the evening, and it's really made my life so great.
[00:15:29.003 --> 00:15:30.565]  Makes my children's life amazing.
[00:15:30.565 --> 00:15:34.590]  That special, again, will end by Sunday or so.
[00:15:34.590 --> 00:15:35.370]  It has to.
[00:15:35.370 --> 00:15:37.493]  And then it's gonna go back to regular price.
[00:15:37.493 --> 00:15:37.893]  And X2 is...
[00:15:40.316 --> 00:15:42.158]  Back in stock.
[00:15:42.158 --> 00:15:44.280]  X2 is back in stock.
[00:15:44.280 --> 00:15:46.943]  The good halogen, the best iodine you're going to find out there.
[00:15:46.943 --> 00:15:52.248]  It's back in stock and 40% off with free shipping right now.

[00:15:55.592 --> 00:15:56.233]  You are critical.
[00:15:58.151 --> 00:15:59.371]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.
[00:15:59.371 --> 00:16:03.292]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[00:16:03.292 --> 00:16:04.833]  I sued the IRS and won.
[00:16:04.833 --> 00:16:07.794]  I beat the IRS then, and I've been beating them ever since.
[00:16:07.794 --> 00:16:13.375]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement, and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved.
[00:16:13.375 --> 00:16:14.355]  I can help you too.
[00:16:14.355 --> 00:16:17.476]  If you owe taxes you can't pay, don't wait another day.
[00:16:17.476 --> 00:16:19.717]  There's no such thing as a hopeless tax case.
[00:16:19.717 --> 00:16:24.158]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX or go to my website, danpilla.com.
[00:16:24.158 --> 00:16:26.439]  That's danpilla.com, danpilla.com.
[00:16:27.919 --> 00:16:31.363]  I'm here with Scott Youseum, founder of OMG Tax.
[00:16:31.363 --> 00:16:36.228]  Tell us how your company helps our listeners out there who have a problem with the IRS.
[00:16:36.228 --> 00:16:42.634]  My team of lawyers, enrolled agents, and licensed tax experts remove wage garnishments sometimes in the same day.
[00:16:42.634 --> 00:16:48.020]  We even have reduced the total debt some of our clients were required to pay through what is known as an offer in compromise.
[00:16:48.080 --> 00:16:50.521]  Can you give us an example of somebody you help?
[00:16:50.521 --> 00:16:51.961]  Oh, can I ever?
[00:16:51.961 --> 00:16:57.102]  We have taken a $500,000 liability with the IRS.
[00:16:57.102 --> 00:16:57.883]  Guess what?
[00:16:57.883 --> 00:17:02.924]  The client didn't pay a dime through the representation known as non-collectible status with the government.
[00:17:02.924 --> 00:17:13.207]  If you owe the IRS more than $10,000 and you want to see if it's possible to pay a lot less, call OMG Tax right now for a free tax-saving consultation.

[00:17:13.667 --> 00:17:13.867]  That's 800-486-8112.
[00:17:13.867 --> 00:17:15.188]  Hunters, anglers, campers, and survivalists.
[00:17:29.980 --> 00:17:31.081]  Get back to nature.

[00:18:03.405 --> 00:18:05.448]  InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:18:05.448 --> 00:18:14.701]  You go to that URL, it takes you to the subsection of InfoWarsTore.com where you find the 60 plus products where we've gone out and researched what is the best,
[00:18:15.322 --> 00:18:17.083]  Well, it gives people the best results.
[00:18:17.083 --> 00:18:20.826]  We either private label it or we develop our own with top developers.
[00:18:20.826 --> 00:18:25.689]  And folks, I'm telling you, you can see the difference in me, my energy, my focus.
[00:18:25.689 --> 00:18:28.571]  I've lost almost 40 pounds in less than four months.
[00:18:28.571 --> 00:18:29.492]  It's incredible.
[00:18:29.492 --> 00:18:31.153]  So do yourself a favor.
[00:18:31.153 --> 00:18:33.655]  Try out the products if you've been on the fence.
[00:18:33.655 --> 00:18:36.537]  You can't lose, except if you don't take action.
[00:18:36.537 --> 00:18:43.502]  Because when you buy the products, you're funding the operation that is always delivering thanks to your support and God's grace and our action.
[00:18:44.062 --> 00:18:45.363]  But you need these products.
[00:18:45.363 --> 00:18:48.424]  That's the real reason you want to get them, is because they're amazing.
[00:18:48.424 --> 00:18:52.345]  And then when you get great results, please tell others about it, word of mouth.
[00:18:52.345 --> 00:18:56.187]  That's how we expand in the face of the NWO, instead of imploding.
[00:18:56.187 --> 00:18:58.928]  We're fighting to win, and we are winning, thanks to you.
[00:18:58.928 --> 00:19:03.089]  Knock on wood, I am not tempting fate.
[00:19:03.089 --> 00:19:07.111]  But everybody around the office, especially folks that have worked here a long time,
[00:19:08.328 --> 00:19:11.129]  I've noticed that I really don't ever get sick.
[00:19:11.129 --> 00:19:14.751]  Now, again, I might get sick tomorrow, because I just made that statement.
[00:19:14.751 --> 00:19:16.031]  I'm not tempting fate.
[00:19:16.031 --> 00:19:19.153]  I'll say that again, because I am superstitious when it comes down to that.
[00:19:19.153 --> 00:19:23.775]  I'm very thankful to the good Lord for the Constitution I've been given.
[00:19:23.775 --> 00:19:32.659]  But up until about eight, nine years ago, when I started taking X2 and the products to enforce life, I still got sick every couple of years.
[00:19:33.777 --> 00:19:37.901]  And, you know, I still get sore throats from allergies and pollen and things like that.
[00:19:37.901 --> 00:19:49.252]  But now that I religiously take the products at InfoWars Life, one of the highest quality supplements you're going to find out there, I just never get a fever anymore.
[00:19:49.252 --> 00:19:54.477]  It's probably been three, four years since I've had a fever.
[00:19:54.477 --> 00:19:55.838]  It's just crazy.
[00:19:55.838 --> 00:19:57.980]  So I chalk it up to genetics and the great products.
[00:20:02.375 --> 00:20:09.796]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[00:20:09.796 --> 00:20:11.097]  We've got it.
[00:20:11.097 --> 00:20:16.938]  This transmission is coming to you.
[00:20:16.938 --> 00:20:21.339]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:20:21.339 --> 00:20:26.960]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the Infowar.
[00:20:36.162 --> 00:20:45.809]  Here is how the committee will proceed for this hearing.
[00:20:45.809 --> 00:20:51.312]  I will make an opening statement, and then I will recognize the ranking member for an opening statement.
[00:20:51.312 --> 00:20:54.414]  After that, we will hear two sets of presentations.
[00:20:54.414 --> 00:20:58.397]  Jerry Madler and the Democrat Party are committing treason against this country!
[00:21:01.061 --> 00:21:13.428]  So I am heading to court right now for my unlawful disruption of Congress when Jerry Nadler was leading the scam, hoax, impeachment trial against President Trump in the House.
[00:21:13.428 --> 00:21:16.849]  Now, this was something I couldn't help but doing when I was in that room.
[00:21:16.849 --> 00:21:22.112]  Just seeing Jerry Nadler lie to me was enough to get me to stand up and say something.
[00:21:22.112 --> 00:21:24.073]  But we'll see what happens today.
[00:21:24.073 --> 00:21:25.614]  We know how corrupt the D.C.
[00:21:25.614 --> 00:21:26.114]  Court is.
[00:21:26.114 --> 00:21:27.535]  We know how partisan it is.
[00:21:27.535 --> 00:21:28.636]  We know how one-sided it is.
[00:21:29.056 --> 00:21:42.521]  We know the treatment of Roger Stone, we've seen what they've done to Flynn, so let's see if even for lower level petty things like unlawful disruption of Congress, which I contest, we'll see if they're even partisan on that.
[00:21:42.521 --> 00:21:45.642]  Which would be quite pathetic, but quite telling indeed.
[00:22:02.953 --> 00:22:07.338]  Jerry Nadler and the Democrat Party are committing treason against this country!
[00:22:07.338 --> 00:22:10.362]  And you can kick me out, but he's the one committing crimes!
[00:22:10.362 --> 00:22:11.944]  You are, Jerry Nadler!
[00:22:11.944 --> 00:22:13.666]  You're the one committing treason!
[00:22:13.666 --> 00:22:15.448]  America's done the thing!
[00:22:15.448 --> 00:22:18.312]  America's sick of the treason committed by the Democrat Party!
[00:22:19.032 --> 00:22:22.276]  We're not going to sit here and watch them run an impeachment investigation and remove ourselves.
[00:22:22.276 --> 00:22:27.283]  We voted for Donald Trump, and there's people removing him because they don't like him.
[00:22:27.283 --> 00:22:32.369]  A lot of people are sick of hearing impeachment, and they're sick of the Democrats reading it.
[00:22:32.369 --> 00:22:35.253]  We know we committed a crime, and it wasn't Trump.
[00:22:35.253 --> 00:22:35.873]  Trump is innocent!
[00:22:46.570 --> 00:22:48.951]  This is Savannah Hernandez for Action 7 News.
[00:22:48.951 --> 00:22:51.152]  I am currently here in Washington D.C.
[00:22:51.152 --> 00:22:52.873]  where Owen Troyer just entered.
[00:22:52.873 --> 00:22:56.294]  Now he's here for his court date after the disruption of Congress.
[00:22:56.294 --> 00:23:03.677]  We know that this is something that many liberal people have gotten away with, yet here is Owen Troyer having to come to court for this disruption.
[00:23:03.677 --> 00:23:09.719]  We'll be giving you live updates and exclusive coverage of this all day.
[00:23:09.719 --> 00:23:13.541]  And we've got both Savannah Hernandez and Owen joining
[00:23:15.376 --> 00:23:43.507]  Our here today and again live reports from DC with the second day of the Trump trial but all it is is the Democrats grandstanding and again telling us over and over again how guilty Trump is trying to game the system just like they gamed the House Intelligence Committee manufacturing these charges that are baseless and are nebulous and now they're trying to game the Senate but that's not happening and the trial should be over
[00:23:44.778 --> 00:23:48.301]  By not next Friday, next Monday is what I'm predicting.
[00:23:48.301 --> 00:23:52.144]  Unless they go over the weekend, it could be done by next Thursday.
[00:23:52.144 --> 00:23:54.225]  But we will be here covering it.
[00:23:54.225 --> 00:23:57.188]  And then once it gets into the Republican case, that's what we haven't seen yet.
[00:23:57.188 --> 00:24:02.032]  The Democrats haven't allowed a Republican case in the House where you would normally get it.
[00:24:02.032 --> 00:24:06.215]  When they were deciding whether or not they would go for the indictment, you would see both sides.
[00:24:06.215 --> 00:24:07.476]  But we only saw one side.
[00:24:08.635 --> 00:24:12.005]  So, three quarters of the time, the Democrats have made sure it's theirs.
[00:24:12.005 --> 00:24:15.817]  But there at the end, the Republicans will have two days to put on their defense.
[00:24:16.567 --> 00:24:22.972]  And then the Senators will have a couple days, McConnell says, to ask questions, and then they should start deliberations.
[00:24:22.972 --> 00:24:26.195]  So that looks to me like next Friday.
[00:24:26.195 --> 00:24:28.216]  That's what most folks are saying as well.
[00:24:28.216 --> 00:24:30.258]  We'll be here covering it live.
[00:24:30.258 --> 00:24:32.560]  And Owen and Savannah are going to come back this weekend to Austin, Texas.
[00:24:32.560 --> 00:24:34.621]  They're going to go back next week to D.C.
[00:24:34.621 --> 00:24:39.065]  with Rob Dew and the rest of the crew up there in D.C.
[00:24:39.065 --> 00:24:39.745]  Gateway Pundit.
[00:24:40.666 --> 00:24:57.092]  Brian Martin, a whole bunch of publications pointed out what a great job Owen Schroer has been doing, especially just going around illustrating how the leftist rent-a-mob individuals are astroturf and how they don't know
[00:24:59.286 --> 00:25:03.470]  Even why they're there or what they are talking about.
[00:25:03.470 --> 00:25:11.777]  So we're going to go to that and then come back and get into the latest on this virus that was recently patented for a vaccine that now magically is hitting everybody.
[00:25:11.777 --> 00:25:15.740]  But here is Owen the Cuck Destroyer in DC.
[00:25:15.740 --> 00:25:18.202]  This just came out yesterday.
[00:25:18.202 --> 00:25:21.005]  We have just entered Capitol Hill here.
[00:25:22.120 --> 00:25:25.761]  And we're trying to figure out what kind of stuff we can do around here right now.
[00:25:25.761 --> 00:25:27.801]  Obviously, there's very strict rules.
[00:25:27.801 --> 00:25:35.823]  And in fact, Mitch McConnell has made it even harder for media to get any access to the Senate floor today as the impeachment trial is ongoing.
[00:25:35.823 --> 00:25:38.764]  So we walk in and we're like, hmm, you know, what are we going to do?
[00:25:38.764 --> 00:25:41.385]  And then, oh, we find these guys.
[00:25:42.526 --> 00:25:43.847]  The impeached Trump group.
[00:25:43.847 --> 00:25:48.090]  So let's go find out if they have any idea why Trump should be impeached.
[00:25:48.090 --> 00:25:50.973]  And I'll go ahead and school them on the issues.
[00:25:50.973 --> 00:25:56.197]  So can you guys tell me why Trump should be impeached?
[00:25:56.197 --> 00:25:59.119]  Is that because you don't know the reason?
[00:25:59.119 --> 00:26:00.440]  He's impeached already.
[00:26:00.440 --> 00:26:02.562]  You don't know the reason, do you?
[00:26:02.562 --> 00:26:03.642]  He's impeached already.
[00:26:03.642 --> 00:26:04.563]  So I'm going to dominate them.
[00:26:04.563 --> 00:26:05.824]  Let's dominate them.
[00:26:05.824 --> 00:26:07.886]  So here's the truth about Trump's impeachment.
[00:26:09.312 --> 00:26:13.556]  They're claiming that Trump's impeachment is for Ukrainian quid pro quo.
[00:26:13.556 --> 00:26:24.745]  The only problem is Nancy Pelosi, who advanced the articles of impeachment to the Senate, admitted that they started this inquiry before Trump was even president.
[00:26:25.706 --> 00:26:29.789]  So how can they impeach Trump for something he did as president?
[00:26:29.789 --> 00:26:30.569]  You're in the way.
[00:26:30.569 --> 00:26:31.670]  You're in the way.
[00:26:31.670 --> 00:26:33.951]  So how, can you not touch my cameraman please?
[00:26:33.951 --> 00:26:35.032]  Here we go, here we go.
[00:26:35.032 --> 00:26:36.573]  Yeah, let's get them going.
[00:26:36.573 --> 00:26:38.174]  So here's the five minutes of hate.
[00:26:38.174 --> 00:26:46.259]  They'll deny the reality that Nancy Pelosi admitted that they started the impeachment process before Trump became president.
[00:26:46.259 --> 00:26:47.800]  So how... It's bull****.
[00:26:47.800 --> 00:26:49.201]  No, that's a... Sir, let me talk.
[00:26:49.201 --> 00:26:50.042]  Would you like to talk?
[00:26:50.802 --> 00:26:52.463]  What is Trump being impeached for?
[00:26:52.463 --> 00:26:53.363]  Sir, I will talk to you.
[00:26:53.363 --> 00:26:54.304]  I'll explain the truth.
[00:26:54.304 --> 00:26:57.705]  Trump is being impeached for what?
[00:26:57.705 --> 00:26:58.986]  No, no, what?
[00:26:58.986 --> 00:27:01.667]  What are they bringing forward?
[00:27:01.667 --> 00:27:02.147]  Why?
[00:27:02.147 --> 00:27:03.448]  No, no, why?
[00:27:03.448 --> 00:27:03.788]  Why?
[00:27:03.788 --> 00:27:04.969]  What was it?
[00:27:04.969 --> 00:27:07.690]  Can anybody tell me why Trump was impeached?
[00:27:07.690 --> 00:27:09.491]  Can anybody tell me why Trump was impeached?
[00:27:10.478 --> 00:27:11.900]  None of you can!
[00:27:11.900 --> 00:27:14.142]  Because you... No, that's not true!
[00:27:14.142 --> 00:27:15.283]  It was Ukraine!
[00:27:15.283 --> 00:27:16.825]  It was the phone call with Ukraine!
[00:27:16.825 --> 00:27:18.787]  So they don't even know why!
[00:27:18.787 --> 00:27:21.310]  They don't even know why Trump was impeached!
[00:27:21.310 --> 00:27:23.933]  It was the phone call with Ukraine!
[00:27:23.933 --> 00:27:31.000]  And by the way, Nancy Pelosi admitted they started the impeachment process before the phone call ever happened!
[00:27:31.821 --> 00:27:34.923]  So they were... No, sir, explain to me what he's being impeached for.
[00:27:34.923 --> 00:27:37.625]  She did not start it before.
[00:27:37.625 --> 00:27:40.227]  No, she said that on a national televised interview.
[00:27:40.227 --> 00:27:41.488]  I didn't hear that.
[00:27:41.488 --> 00:27:42.909]  Okay, well maybe you should look into it.
[00:27:42.909 --> 00:27:44.030]  I'll go look at it.
[00:27:44.030 --> 00:27:45.711]  You should, but why should Trump be impeached?
[00:27:45.711 --> 00:27:46.211]  What did he do?
[00:27:46.211 --> 00:27:47.312]  You're out here protesting.
[00:27:47.312 --> 00:27:47.932]  Yeah, this guy again.
[00:27:50.394 --> 00:27:55.357]  So there you go, another impeached Trump crowd that can't say why Trump should be impeached.
[00:27:55.357 --> 00:28:01.260]  You can go to every impeached Trump rally in this country and not one of them can say why Trump should be impeached.
[00:28:01.260 --> 00:28:02.420]  Not one of them.
[00:28:02.420 --> 00:28:08.703]  And if they were real activists that had any truth to their movement, they can answer a single question.
[00:28:08.703 --> 00:28:10.644]  You guys are all fraud.
[00:28:10.644 --> 00:28:11.785]  You've all been deceived.
[00:28:11.785 --> 00:28:13.426]  Sir, I can explain things.
[00:28:13.426 --> 00:28:14.987]  I know how you feel.
[00:28:14.987 --> 00:28:15.727]  I've heard it.
[00:28:15.727 --> 00:28:16.587]  I know how you feel.
[00:28:16.587 --> 00:28:17.148]  How is that, ma'am?
[00:28:17.768 --> 00:28:19.610]  But why is he impeached?
[00:28:19.610 --> 00:28:20.952]  Why is he impeached though?
[00:28:20.952 --> 00:28:22.474]  So they can't answer.
[00:28:22.474 --> 00:28:25.077]  None of them can answer.
[00:28:25.077 --> 00:28:27.080]  None of them can answer.
[00:28:27.080 --> 00:28:31.886]  I'm not allowed to talk to the mentally defective here.
[00:28:31.886 --> 00:28:33.448]  You're not allowed to speak to the mentally ill.
[00:28:37.563 --> 00:28:39.244]  Flawless victory.
[00:28:39.244 --> 00:28:44.027]  It's very, very sad how brainwashed and brain-damaged these people are.
[00:28:44.027 --> 00:28:52.231]  They're followers, they're empty, they look like they've had their soul sucked out, and that's very, very sad, but that's who falls for the globalist garbage.
[00:28:52.231 --> 00:28:55.653]  Now we're going to break down the coronavirus when we return.
[00:28:58.208 --> 00:29:00.190]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[00:29:00.190 --> 00:29:05.494]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you.
[00:29:05.494 --> 00:29:07.096]  But the symptoms are there.
[00:29:07.096 --> 00:29:15.443]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[00:29:15.443 --> 00:29:21.128]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[00:29:21.308 --> 00:29:23.130]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[00:29:23.130 --> 00:29:25.392]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[00:29:25.392 --> 00:29:29.795]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[00:29:29.795 --> 00:29:31.997]  I recommend Heart and Body Extract to everyone.

[00:29:58.792 --> 00:30:02.374]  InfoWars Life is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine.
[00:30:02.374 --> 00:30:04.155]  Introducing Pollen Block.
[00:30:04.155 --> 00:30:15.421]  We have found an extraordinary new, natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms, including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort, and respiratory function.
[00:30:16.201 --> 00:30:24.987]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs experienced less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses.
[00:30:24.987 --> 00:30:35.914]  They began studying this effect in published trials, and decades later, we now have the fruit of this research, a fast-acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms.
[00:30:36.434 --> 00:30:39.056]  Pollen Block is natural and effective.
[00:30:39.056 --> 00:30:40.777]  It is not an antihistamine.
[00:30:40.777 --> 00:30:50.764]  In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of tryptase, which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.
[00:30:50.764 --> 00:30:53.426]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe.
[00:30:53.426 --> 00:30:58.130]  Head to Infowarslife.com and grab a pack of our Pollen Block chewable tablets.
[00:30:58.837 --> 00:31:11.650]  This is a call for modern-day Paul Reveres, who are all Americans, who are all human beings, who bleed red blood, love God, and love justice, and who have awakened to the New World Order threat.
[00:31:11.650 --> 00:31:22.261]  You are the modern Paul Reveres, and without you, no one knows about Bandod Video, and our live coverage of the attempt to remove the President in the Senate trial, and the Deep State trying to
[00:31:27.145 --> 00:31:27.205]  I'm
[00:31:47.073 --> 00:31:47.554]  We're good to go.
[00:31:59.184 --> 00:32:02.847]  It's time to take a new, healthier approach to one of your most basic needs.

[00:33:01.852 --> 00:33:04.473]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show!
[00:33:20.171 --> 00:33:21.312]  Big Brother.
[00:33:21.312 --> 00:33:23.094]  Mainstream media.
[00:33:23.094 --> 00:33:24.996]  Government cover-ups.
[00:33:24.996 --> 00:33:26.698]  You want to stop tyranny?
[00:33:26.698 --> 00:33:28.339]  Well, so does he.
[00:33:28.339 --> 00:33:33.064]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:39.580 --> 00:33:43.843]  You know, when InfoWars tells you something's bombshell news, we're not hyping it.
[00:33:43.843 --> 00:33:45.044]  There's a lot of bombshells, though.
[00:33:45.044 --> 00:33:49.467]  This is a war for the future of humanity on this planet and beyond.
[00:33:49.467 --> 00:33:54.671]  Infinity and beyond, as Buzz Lightyear likes to say.
[00:33:54.671 --> 00:34:02.677]  But I just got a call, or the producer did, Daria, two minutes ago, saying Owen just got out of court.
[00:34:02.677 --> 00:34:03.558]  It's bombshell news.
[00:34:03.558 --> 00:34:04.618]  They're trying to put him in jail.
[00:34:05.694 --> 00:34:14.576]  For going in there at the kickoff of impeachment and saying who needs to really be impeached is the Democrats and the deep state.
[00:34:14.576 --> 00:34:23.158]  Now, we can't find cases where the Democrats, other than the fact that they got physical sometimes, sometimes they've gotten physical, they've actually been indicted.
[00:34:23.158 --> 00:34:27.579]  But when the Democrats take over live events, they don't get in trouble.
[00:34:27.579 --> 00:34:31.780]  They might get arrested, but they're throwing the book at Owen Schroeder.
[00:34:31.780 --> 00:34:34.301]  So we'll find out what the big news is.
[00:34:34.301 --> 00:34:35.061]  He just got out of court.
[00:34:36.414 --> 00:34:43.660]  Coming up in about 10 minutes, when we go to break, and then we'll come back in about 12 minutes, we will know exactly what's going on on that front.
[00:34:43.660 --> 00:34:46.282]  Okay.
[00:34:46.282 --> 00:34:59.994]  This is a subject that I'm gonna kick off right now, but that I want to open the phones up in the second, third, and into the fourth hour today, because it's a big deal.
[00:34:59.994 --> 00:35:04.298]  These coronaviruses, or what they used to call bird flu,
[00:35:05.703 --> 00:35:06.703]  Are you kidding?
[00:35:26.584 --> 00:35:40.988]  They hypothesized and now they've proven that a lot of these mutations happen because pigs are closer to humans and that somehow then there's a transmutation and it's able to cross over into a virus that humans can get.
[00:35:40.988 --> 00:35:46.009]  And when you get a new zoological virus, a lot of times it tends to be extremely deadly.
[00:35:46.009 --> 00:35:49.650]  So they've been working on a bunch of vaccines for these.
[00:35:49.650 --> 00:35:55.372]  And there is a Hybrite Institute, am I pronouncing that right?
[00:35:56.555 --> 00:36:01.757]  That's the shadowy, you know, secretive group like a lot of these big foundations and where they get their money.
[00:36:01.757 --> 00:36:22.243]  I would guess a lot of it's probably Bill and Melinda Gates, but they've been working on trying to create a vaccine for this and so they've patented over the years different mutations
[00:36:25.484 --> 00:36:29.166]  Of the virus.
[00:36:29.166 --> 00:36:38.630]  And so I just find it very, very interesting that magically there's a vaccine for this now and well, there you go, for this coronavirus.
[00:36:38.630 --> 00:36:43.753]  And here are some of the reports coming out.
[00:36:43.753 --> 00:36:50.816]  Coronavirus death toll doubles to 17 as more than 470 cases of mutating bug confirmed.
[00:36:50.816 --> 00:36:51.877]  That's the sun.
[00:36:53.544 --> 00:37:00.668]  The state of panic hits the globe as cases of China's new mystery virus rise exponentially.
[00:37:00.668 --> 00:37:01.329]  First U.S.
[00:37:01.329 --> 00:37:08.453]  case of Wuhan coronavirus confirmed by the Centers for Disease Control in Washington State.
[00:37:08.453 --> 00:37:13.837]  Experts estimate at least 4,000 people infected with coronavirus in cases could reach the U.K.
[00:37:13.837 --> 00:37:17.339]  At least 500 ill.
[00:37:17.339 --> 00:37:19.280]  You know it's probably a lot more than that.
[00:37:20.751 --> 00:37:27.493]  I know there was a virus similar to this that killed my uncle and a bunch of other people in East Texas.
[00:37:27.493 --> 00:37:31.295]  This was six years ago.
[00:37:31.295 --> 00:37:37.017]  And folks could not believe how deadly it was.
[00:37:37.017 --> 00:37:43.539]  And I talked to doctors and nurses and they said, well, we're not creating a panic, but yeah, there's a cover-up on just how
[00:37:45.700 --> 00:37:52.567]  Deadly this is and how high the mortality rate is and how infectious it is.
[00:37:52.567 --> 00:37:56.110]  Killer coronavirus attacks the body with pneumonia.
[00:37:56.110 --> 00:37:58.973]  Symptoms to look out for.
[00:37:58.973 --> 00:38:06.080]  And now of course they've got heat scanners at the airport saying you've got a fever and they're supposedly checking you for it.
[00:38:06.080 --> 00:38:08.022]  You know what's wrong with this whole picture?
[00:38:10.009 --> 00:38:17.454]  They're telling us on the menu at China's virus market, Yahoo News, French News Agency, rats and live wolf pups.
[00:38:17.454 --> 00:38:22.697]  Now that's the type of stuff they eat there, imported from around the world.
[00:38:22.697 --> 00:38:29.622]  And yes, you can get diseases from eating weird foods like that, but it's the genetic engineering, it's the vaccines mixing.
[00:38:29.622 --> 00:38:32.424]  How many times have vaccines caused pandemics and they've admitted it?
[00:38:32.424 --> 00:38:35.986]  In the old days they just admitted it, but now they just cover it up.
[00:38:35.986 --> 00:38:38.328]  So pointing at that market is a big distraction.
[00:38:39.383 --> 00:38:43.988]  Pandemic fears grow as China virus toll rises.
[00:38:43.988 --> 00:38:47.332]  But what's really going on here?
[00:38:47.332 --> 00:38:53.940]  Well, tens of thousands have now died from Ebola in the last few rounds, the biggest outbreaks ever in the Congo.
[00:38:54.932 --> 00:39:19.687]  And then there's a program with George Soros and the UN publicly flying them out of the Congo into Mexico, and then Mexico lets them come through, and then there's groups picking them up, loading them on vans in Austin, San Antonio, and other areas, and taking them all over the United States, when the Ebola is much more deadly than this.
[00:39:20.819 --> 00:39:22.120]  And we know there's been cases in the U.S.
[00:39:22.120 --> 00:39:24.142]  that have been covered up, and cases in the Caribbean.
[00:39:24.142 --> 00:39:26.945]  That's been confirmed!
[00:39:26.945 --> 00:39:36.273]  So why in the hell would the deep state want thousands of Congonese coming in a week that we know of still ongoing?
[00:39:36.273 --> 00:39:39.576]  We've gone out and caught it ourself.
[00:39:39.576 --> 00:39:42.899]  People being snuck out of dormitories at night, loaded onto buses.
[00:39:42.899 --> 00:39:45.742]  Our reporter, Gregory, is physically assaulted.
[00:39:49.414 --> 00:39:54.940]  But if you try to sneak across the border as a citizen, you get in trouble, and you should, because we don't have a border, we don't have a nation.
[00:39:54.940 --> 00:39:59.045]  But Bernie Sanders says, get rid of our borders, even existing.
[00:39:59.045 --> 00:40:01.768]  So I know this.
[00:40:01.768 --> 00:40:08.696]  SV40, the year before the big outbreak, was it 10, 11, 13 years ago, time flies, was an admitted simulant
[00:40:09.895 --> 00:40:28.208]  That the CDC authorized to be put in the previous year's flu vaccine as a live flu virus that they had genetically engineered, they said to be not harmful, to track the spread of flu and the mutation to try to guess the mutation the next year.
[00:40:28.208 --> 00:40:35.874]  And then we had a really bad outbreak that particular year, if you're a member of the flu.
[00:40:37.113 --> 00:40:43.217]  And I had medical doctors and virologists on, I'm not an expert, they are, saying, this is engineered, this was released.
[00:40:43.217 --> 00:40:44.778]  And that's the thing about, the U.N.
[00:40:44.778 --> 00:40:53.743]  admitted in those shock admissions by their top scientists that we've been covering, happened last December 2nd and 3rd, got no coverage until we broke it down here.
[00:40:53.743 --> 00:40:56.565]  Frighteningly enough, it had been out for weeks on their website.
[00:40:56.565 --> 00:41:01.528]  They even hide it.
[00:41:01.528 --> 00:41:04.790]  And they say, we don't even have studies on the adjuvants now, they're mixing much less
[00:41:05.683 --> 00:41:14.232]  The mutagenic effects of these live viruses that they engineer and they just say, oh it's safe, but it mutates and it sheds.
[00:41:14.232 --> 00:41:16.454]  You know sheds?
[00:41:16.454 --> 00:41:20.999]  Like when somebody's got herpes and it sheds when you have sex with somebody and they get it?
[00:41:20.999 --> 00:41:22.761]  Or Ebola sheds?
[00:41:22.761 --> 00:41:24.202]  Or the flu sheds?
[00:41:24.202 --> 00:41:26.825]  That means it goes in to cells.
[00:41:29.167 --> 00:41:30.888]  It replicates.
[00:41:30.888 --> 00:41:31.928]  It takes some over.
[00:41:31.928 --> 00:41:33.228]  They just go, but it's not a problem.
[00:41:33.228 --> 00:41:34.989]  It doesn't take over too many and make you sick.
[00:41:34.989 --> 00:41:43.232]  And then, those cells explode, and millions more spread, and they... They say, oh, don't worry, these new ones vaccinate everyone.
[00:41:43.232 --> 00:41:46.553]  See, that's the big sick joke, is, oh, you're not gonna take the vaccines?
[00:41:46.553 --> 00:41:49.534]  Yes, you are.
[00:41:49.534 --> 00:41:55.576]  And you see how that's hiding in plain view?
[00:41:55.576 --> 00:41:56.256]  Ladies and gentlemen,
[00:41:57.469 --> 00:41:58.870]  And that's when they were hiding the folks.
[00:41:58.870 --> 00:42:03.474]  We had to hide out there at night and then catch them being snuck out at night if you fast forward on this tape.
[00:42:03.474 --> 00:42:06.056]  This is just shocking stuff we're doing.
[00:42:06.056 --> 00:42:07.817]  And that's why they want us off the air.
[00:42:07.817 --> 00:42:15.483]  Because Right Side Broadcasting and Judicial Watch are carrying feeds that they paid for off the government and C-SPAN feeds.
[00:42:15.483 --> 00:42:17.104]  You can buy it from the government or C-SPAN.
[00:42:17.104 --> 00:42:19.266]  They're in a partnership with Congress.
[00:42:19.266 --> 00:42:20.947]  It's very inexpensive.
[00:42:20.947 --> 00:42:24.170]  A couple hundred bucks last time we did it to pay for a feed.
[00:42:24.170 --> 00:42:26.332]  Now we just have the satellite feeds here and subscribe to them.
[00:42:28.095 --> 00:42:35.341]  And Jack Dorsey, Oliver Dorsey, Oliver Dorsey calls up and says, that's his job.
[00:42:35.341 --> 00:42:37.423]  He says, you've got an extremist here.
[00:42:37.423 --> 00:42:39.684]  Oh, YouTube blocked it.
[00:42:39.684 --> 00:42:40.805]  That's in the news right here.
[00:42:40.805 --> 00:42:42.727]  So that's the level.
[00:42:42.727 --> 00:42:43.768]  They don't want us on air.
[00:42:43.768 --> 00:42:45.469]  They don't want us being able to cover any of this.
[00:42:45.469 --> 00:42:46.650]  They are the masters.
[00:42:46.650 --> 00:42:48.511]  They are the controllers.
[00:42:48.511 --> 00:42:50.973]  They're the ones that are going to suppress the American people, but they're not.
[00:42:50.973 --> 00:42:53.576]  Because we have band.video and you're sharing it.
[00:42:53.576 --> 00:42:56.438]  We have our own transmission system, but only you can amplify it.
[00:42:58.129 --> 00:43:08.174]  It is I, the leader of Cobra, here for a message to President Trump, the American people, and Alex Jones of InfoWars.
[00:43:08.174 --> 00:43:14.177]  Our operations with our partners, the Communist Chinese, have bought control of your media.
[00:43:14.177 --> 00:43:16.018]  But it's true.
[00:43:16.018 --> 00:43:19.199]  Your people are beginning to awaken.
[00:43:19.199 --> 00:43:22.841]  That's why Cobra is launching operations to trigger
[00:43:22.881 --> 00:43:23.101]  I think.
[00:43:40.948 --> 00:43:55.882]  You see, when you expose our false flags and fake media, I will carry out attacks, and then blame you, like we've done with Alex Jones, blaming him for mass shootings we committed!
[00:43:55.882 --> 00:43:56.222]  Ha ha!
[00:43:56.222 --> 00:43:56.762]  Hail Cobra!
[00:43:58.906 --> 00:44:04.127]  Allergies, dander, asthma, germs, toxins.
[00:44:04.127 --> 00:44:08.408]  There are many reasons why we need to think about what is really in the air around us.
[00:44:08.408 --> 00:44:12.849]  We may not be able to stop breathing, but we can control what's in the air we breathe.
[00:44:12.849 --> 00:44:21.251]  The revolutionary Alexa Pure Breathe air filtration system is a powerful ally in the fight against the dangerous toxins and viruses in the air.
[00:44:21.251 --> 00:44:28.472]  Powerful, quiet, and effective, the Breathe uses a four-step purification process to help you breathe easier and cleaner.
[00:44:28.912 --> 00:44:32.513]  Similar systems could cost hundreds to even thousands of dollars.
[00:44:32.513 --> 00:44:37.814]  But the Alexa Pure Breeze air purification is the best and most affordable bar none.
[00:44:37.814 --> 00:44:45.896]  The breeze and the ion cluster patented technology used in the system eliminate up to 99.97% of airborne contaminants.
[00:44:45.896 --> 00:44:51.278]  Get the Alexa Pure Breeze today and save big on a world-class air filtration system for your home.
[00:44:51.278 --> 00:44:53.538]  Don't keep breathing toxic or dangerous air.

[00:44:58.646 --> 00:45:01.868]  There's a lot of phony garbage out there in the world.
[00:45:01.868 --> 00:45:04.269]  A lot of people that never deliver.
[00:45:04.269 --> 00:45:17.497]  Well, I'm here to tell you, InfoWars has delivered in royal flush in a handful of ace of spades because of God, because of the audience of activists, and because of the great team at InfoWars.
[00:45:17.497 --> 00:45:20.838]  And we are all a team, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:45:20.838 --> 00:45:24.761]  So right now, humanity's awakening is explosive, it's powerful, it's incredible.
[00:45:25.541 --> 00:45:34.893]  But there's major obstacles coming down the road, and the only way we can effectively fight the NWO and stay in the game, like MFWC, is your financial support.
[00:45:34.893 --> 00:45:37.697]  We make it really easy at MFWCstore.com.
[00:45:37.697 --> 00:45:42.483]  But I am blowing through our backup money right now with our reporters.
[00:45:42.503 --> 00:45:44.024]  I love watching David Knight in the morning.
[00:45:44.024 --> 00:45:45.444]  I love tuning in to Owen Schroer.
[00:45:45.444 --> 00:45:46.985]  I love all the other shows we do here.
[00:45:46.985 --> 00:45:48.285]  But I'll be honest with you.
[00:45:48.285 --> 00:45:51.707]  We run during the breaks a lot of news reports because I'm sick of hearing the ads.
[00:46:11.095 --> 00:46:12.979]  So you think you don't want to hear an ad?
[00:46:12.979 --> 00:46:14.281]  I don't want to hear an ad.
[00:46:14.281 --> 00:46:15.022]  But here's the bottom line.
[00:46:16.038 --> 00:46:17.498]  We're barely paying the bills here.
[00:46:17.498 --> 00:46:20.199]  And I want to expand in the face of the globalists, not contract.
[00:46:20.199 --> 00:46:21.359]  I don't want them to win.
[00:46:21.359 --> 00:46:24.280]  So listen, you've got this guarantee from me.
[00:46:24.280 --> 00:46:27.381]  We sell enough product, we'll have less ads and less plugs.
[00:46:27.381 --> 00:46:30.541]  And we'll expand and really give the globalists enough of their money.
[00:46:30.541 --> 00:46:34.342]  But we've got products you already really need, like DNA Force Plus, X2.
[00:46:34.342 --> 00:46:35.923]  These will change your life.
[00:46:35.923 --> 00:46:37.323]  Go check out the turmeric products.
[00:46:37.323 --> 00:46:39.324]  Check out the water filtration, air filtration.
[00:46:39.324 --> 00:46:40.024]  Check it all out.
[00:46:40.024 --> 00:46:41.964]  Whatever you do, take action and know.
[00:46:41.964 --> 00:46:43.745]  Be part of the second American revolution.
[00:46:43.745 --> 00:46:44.945]  Be part of crushing the globalists.
[00:46:45.345 --> 00:46:47.327]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[00:47:14.198 --> 00:47:16.739]  I don't want to interrupt, then I'm leaving.
[00:47:16.739 --> 00:47:17.800]  You've been doing great, Owen.
[00:47:17.800 --> 00:47:20.381]  You're going to finish up with these calls within Gregory's.
[00:47:20.381 --> 00:47:23.702]  And, of course, Harris and Smith are going to take another hour of calls.
[00:47:23.702 --> 00:47:25.083]  Crews volunteered to do it.
[00:47:25.083 --> 00:47:28.504]  So we're here, live covering this, hoping everything de-escalates.
[00:47:28.504 --> 00:47:29.765]  So the live coverage continues.
[00:47:29.765 --> 00:47:31.106]  Everybody spread those links.
[00:47:31.106 --> 00:47:33.487]  The Globals are hacking us, trying to shut this down.
[00:47:33.487 --> 00:47:34.227]  Don't let them win.
[00:47:34.227 --> 00:47:34.567]  No BS.
[00:47:34.567 --> 00:47:36.948]  Let me tell you, everything's straight shooting here.
[00:47:36.948 --> 00:47:39.389]  See, I don't have some Machiavelli manipulative view.
[00:47:39.389 --> 00:47:41.630]  With me, it's all straightforward attack.
[00:47:41.630 --> 00:47:42.751]  That's the real power!
[00:47:43.891 --> 00:47:46.994]  Don't act so surprised, Globalist.
[00:47:46.994 --> 00:47:50.798]  You didn't think you could silence the American people, did you?
[00:47:50.798 --> 00:47:54.742]  Join Bandot Video, and I will complete your training.
[00:47:54.742 --> 00:47:58.665]  Together, we can overthrow the Emperor and restore the Republic.
[00:48:04.660 --> 00:48:09.601]  You have to do every single thing I say or we will not make it.
[00:48:09.601 --> 00:48:10.541]  Understand?
[00:48:10.541 --> 00:48:12.242]  Do you understand?
[00:48:12.242 --> 00:48:15.122]  Come with me if you want to live.
[00:48:15.122 --> 00:48:29.986]  Come with me if you want to live.
[00:48:29.986 --> 00:48:31.266]  Alex Royer has been in DC.
[00:48:32.887 --> 00:48:34.008]  Dozens of times.
[00:48:34.008 --> 00:48:37.310]  He's been on Capitol Hill probably over a hundred times.
[00:48:37.310 --> 00:48:46.196]  But as a citizen, not as a journalist, he spontaneously, as you know, last month, stood up to Jerry Nadler and said, it's you that's guilty of treason.
[00:48:46.196 --> 00:48:52.620]  It's you that are obstructing the progress of our country with your false kangaroo operations.
[00:48:52.620 --> 00:48:54.542]  That was the day they were getting ready to vote.
[00:48:55.682 --> 00:49:03.324]  Move the indictment onto the Senate, and now you see that ongoing fiasco about the Democrats trying to stall as long as they can.
[00:49:03.324 --> 00:49:09.065]  And we have Pelosi admitting impeachment began the day Trump was elected.
[00:49:09.065 --> 00:49:11.985]  We'll play that clip in a few minutes.
[00:49:11.985 --> 00:49:17.946]  Now, Owen Schroer is about to fill everybody in on what happened.
[00:49:17.946 --> 00:49:20.767]  And just cut into the chase, then he'll lay it all out.
[00:49:22.418 --> 00:49:23.518]  You've all seen what he did.
[00:49:23.518 --> 00:49:24.899]  Politely but focused.
[00:49:24.899 --> 00:49:26.940]  Laid out the facts for like 30 seconds.
[00:49:26.940 --> 00:49:29.020]  Shot heard around the world in the information war.
[00:49:29.020 --> 00:49:32.482]  Resonated with everybody because it was the truth.
[00:49:32.482 --> 00:49:36.563]  The gallery was empty because you're supposed to have citizens allowed in there but they weren't letting anybody in.
[00:49:36.563 --> 00:49:43.045]  But Owen and Drew both have a confident bearing about them.
[00:49:43.045 --> 00:49:47.847]  Owen looks like a Calvin Klein model and Drew looks like Fidel Castro's grandson.
[00:49:47.847 --> 00:49:50.308]  And so they just walk right in.
[00:49:51.755 --> 00:49:58.038]  And then again, we're able to observe, and Owen felt driven.
[00:49:58.038 --> 00:50:00.118]  Because I told him, don't get arrested and don't do stuff like that.
[00:50:00.118 --> 00:50:04.660]  You've seen, I don't do that, because I don't want them to pull a bunch of garbage on us.
[00:50:04.660 --> 00:50:09.782]  When Democrats do it, they just promise not to do it again, and they just ship more Soros people in.
[00:50:09.782 --> 00:50:13.364]  We've gone and checked, almost no one has ever charged, almost no one ever gets to court.
[00:50:13.364 --> 00:50:15.285]  But not Owen!
[00:50:15.285 --> 00:50:20.607]  He got in today, and they were treating him like he was a already convicted crack dealer who got busted on his fifth
[00:50:22.156 --> 00:50:23.438]  Homicide charge.
[00:50:23.438 --> 00:50:24.980]  Or he just got caught robbing a liquor store.
[00:50:24.980 --> 00:50:26.862]  They're like, you're going to jail.
[00:50:26.862 --> 00:50:29.045]  You're getting drug tested.
[00:50:29.045 --> 00:50:31.168]  You're banned from ever going to Congress.
[00:50:31.168 --> 00:50:32.029]  Sign right here.
[00:50:32.029 --> 00:50:34.152]  Oh, and his counsel said no.
[00:50:36.107 --> 00:50:40.590]  And then all of a sudden they get on the phone with Congress and the Democrats and they're telling the judges what to do.
[00:50:40.590 --> 00:50:48.635]  So that's how dangerous this is and how they've weaponized the judicial system in many areas the Democrats control against the American people.
[00:50:48.635 --> 00:50:50.015]  So, Owen Schroer joins us.
[00:50:50.015 --> 00:50:52.197]  He's out in front of the White House right now.
[00:50:52.817 --> 00:50:57.181]  And that was me bullhorning that letter about Trump needing to take action when he was in court this morning.
[00:50:57.181 --> 00:50:59.683]  Here's footage of that happening.
[00:50:59.683 --> 00:51:01.204]  So, Owen, thank you for joining us.
[00:51:01.204 --> 00:51:01.925]  Amazing job.
[00:51:01.925 --> 00:51:06.229]  The great coverage you and Savannah are laying out with Harrison Smith is big national news.
[00:51:06.229 --> 00:51:08.691]  Thank God you're there altering the globalist narrative.
[00:51:08.691 --> 00:51:10.652]  Fox News isn't doing it.
[00:51:10.652 --> 00:51:11.653]  Other folks aren't doing it.
[00:51:11.653 --> 00:51:14.215]  So, so important to keep you in the game, my friend.
[00:51:14.215 --> 00:51:15.577]  It's listeners that keep you in the game.
[00:51:15.577 --> 00:51:17.098]  Tell us succinctly what happened.
[00:51:19.059 --> 00:51:20.320]  Well, and that's it right there, Alex.
[00:51:20.320 --> 00:51:23.841]  They want me out of the game just like they want you, just like they want InfoWars out of the game.
[00:51:23.841 --> 00:51:32.085]  And that's why they were attempting to ban me from Capitol grounds, ban me from all congressional offices.
[00:51:32.085 --> 00:51:35.127]  As you said, we rejected that notion.
[00:51:35.127 --> 00:51:38.168]  And we actually had to be in two different courtrooms today.
[00:51:38.168 --> 00:51:48.833]  So when we got into the first courtroom and dealt with the judge there, basically what we learned was that the state prosecutors are taking orders from
[00:51:49.412 --> 00:51:50.052]  I don't think so.
[00:52:04.668 --> 00:52:06.490]  I refuse these demands.
[00:52:06.490 --> 00:52:10.894]  They then moved it up to a higher court, where we got in front of another judge.
[00:52:10.894 --> 00:52:14.217]  A different state prosecuting attorney came up and said the same thing.
[00:52:14.217 --> 00:52:17.000]  We want Schroer banned from all Capitol buildings.
[00:52:17.000 --> 00:52:19.883]  We want him banned from all congressional offices.
[00:52:19.883 --> 00:52:22.445]  Now, the judge in this case said, absolutely not.
[00:52:22.445 --> 00:52:24.407]  That's a violation of the First Amendment.
[00:52:24.407 --> 00:52:28.411]  But given the current circumstances, I will issue a no-hats order.
[00:52:28.411 --> 00:52:29.012]  So basically,
[00:52:29.542 --> 00:52:38.364]  I'm allowed to be on the Capitol grounds, I'm allowed to go into chambers, but I'm really not allowed to talk, and I'm really not allowed to film, and I'm not allowed to do my job.
[00:52:38.364 --> 00:52:40.265]  Now, we'll see how all that develops.
[00:52:40.265 --> 00:52:43.745]  I am due back in court next week, and we'll see how that goes.
[00:52:43.745 --> 00:52:47.706]  But yeah, they wanted to ban me from all Capitol buildings, all Congressional offices.
[00:52:47.706 --> 00:52:49.667]  They wanted to drug test me.
[00:52:49.667 --> 00:52:50.067]  Why?
[00:52:50.067 --> 00:52:50.527]  I don't know.
[00:52:50.527 --> 00:52:54.208]  This has nothing to do with a drug offense, but just some procedural things.
[00:52:54.208 --> 00:52:55.928]  And by the way, you don't even drink.
[00:52:55.928 --> 00:52:57.709]  I mean, if you're addicted to anything, it's exercise.
[00:52:59.962 --> 00:53:04.064]  And all the legal minds hearing this are stunned that it went down like this today.
[00:53:04.064 --> 00:53:05.865]  But this is what it is.
[00:53:05.865 --> 00:53:11.147]  We already know about the digital censorship that's happening with InfoWars, with conservatives and Trump supporters.
[00:53:11.147 --> 00:53:12.488]  This is real world censorship.
[00:53:12.488 --> 00:53:14.889]  They know that that video of me confronting Nadler
[00:53:15.330 --> 00:53:19.112]  Is the biggest video, perhaps, in 2019 going into 2020.
[00:53:19.112 --> 00:53:20.573]  They don't want a repeat of that.
[00:53:20.573 --> 00:53:26.275]  They also brought up the video that Rob Dew shot of me yesterday, talking to the Remove Trump protesters.
[00:53:26.275 --> 00:53:30.638]  They brought that up as evidence, saying, see, Schroyer's not allowed on Capitol grounds.
[00:53:30.638 --> 00:53:31.998]  Look at how he causes a scene.
[00:53:31.998 --> 00:53:33.219]  Causes a scene?
[00:53:33.219 --> 00:53:36.741]  There's 30 of them out there, you know, every day, saying, get Trump out!
[00:53:36.741 --> 00:53:37.421]  Remove Trump!
[00:53:37.421 --> 00:53:37.741]  Lying!
[00:53:37.741 --> 00:53:40.843]  But they're allowed to operate, but if Schroyer shows up, he's not allowed.
[00:53:40.843 --> 00:53:41.463]  Here's another one.
[00:53:42.003 --> 00:53:43.524]  And there's dozens of these cases.
[00:53:43.524 --> 00:53:45.466]  We don't have all the names, so we'll use one.
[00:53:45.466 --> 00:53:51.710]  Jane Fonda comes out here every week, does her little disruption of Congress, does her little thing, gets arrested.
[00:53:51.710 --> 00:53:52.471]  Guess what?
[00:53:52.471 --> 00:53:53.811]  They throw it out!
[00:53:53.811 --> 00:53:55.212]  They throw the case out!
[00:53:55.212 --> 00:53:57.234]  They don't even have paperwork for Fonda!
[00:53:57.234 --> 00:54:02.718]  So there's your celebrity liberal privilege, but a little peon citizen who's driven by the truth.
[00:54:03.433 --> 00:54:05.855]  Driven by God's providence, I'm a little peon.
[00:54:05.855 --> 00:54:06.936]  I'm not allowed to exist.
[00:54:06.936 --> 00:54:08.437]  I'm not allowed to report.
[00:54:08.437 --> 00:54:12.881]  And based on what the state's prosecutors are doing, I don't even get free speech.
[00:54:12.881 --> 00:54:13.801]  They don't like me.
[00:54:13.801 --> 00:54:14.822]  They want to shut me down.
[00:54:14.822 --> 00:54:15.743]  Touch me clear.
[00:54:15.743 --> 00:54:16.624]  No one was hurt.
[00:54:16.624 --> 00:54:18.005]  You didn't resist when you went.
[00:54:18.005 --> 00:54:19.966]  The police didn't even think you were going to be arrested.
[00:54:19.966 --> 00:54:24.750]  They were letting you go when they got the word, I guess from Nadler, to arrest you.
[00:54:24.750 --> 00:54:29.474]  And this is the mouse that roars, intimidating the lion, but they're not intimidating us.
[00:54:29.474 --> 00:54:30.055]  And as you said,
[00:54:31.345 --> 00:54:41.351]  Right-side broadcasting, even Judicial Watch, they leased feeds, which anybody can do, we can do it, anybody can do it.
[00:54:41.351 --> 00:54:46.435]  Of the impeachment, those feeds were killed for violating community guidelines, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:54:46.435 --> 00:54:48.336]  So that's the total control.
[00:54:48.336 --> 00:54:53.059]  Now, YouTube is cutting Breitbart feeds from the Virginia gun rally.
[00:54:53.059 --> 00:54:57.202]  They are pissed that we have viewers, we have listeners, and people can see who we are,
[00:54:58.686 --> 00:55:00.227]  Rather than who they claim we are.
[00:55:00.227 --> 00:55:04.210]  Owen, I'm going to come back to you here in just a moment and ask what comes next.
[00:55:04.210 --> 00:55:15.398]  But before he's convicted of anything, not harming anybody, the way it works is, because I've looked at the law, if you get convicted three times disrupting Congress, then you're banned from the building.
[00:55:15.398 --> 00:55:16.979]  And usually it's five years.
[00:55:16.979 --> 00:55:18.020]  He hasn't been convicted once.
[00:55:18.020 --> 00:55:21.563]  That's why they kept saying, you disrupted, admit you disrupted.
[00:55:23.325 --> 00:55:24.426]  He didn't disrupt Congress.
[00:55:24.426 --> 00:55:29.850]  He injected one little bit of citizen truth into it, and he's been arrested, and he's now been in court.
[00:55:29.850 --> 00:55:32.532]  He's got to pay for a lawyer for committing a thought crime.
[00:55:32.532 --> 00:55:35.594]  The Democrats come in and take over those events with Code Pink all the time.
[00:55:35.594 --> 00:55:37.215]  They don't get charged.
[00:55:37.215 --> 00:55:40.518]  Again, it's unequal weights and measures.
[00:55:40.518 --> 00:55:44.701]  It's selective enforcement, and they're trying to push Owen.
[00:55:44.701 --> 00:55:46.302]  They're trying to bamboozle him.
[00:55:46.302 --> 00:55:48.103]  They're trying to Shanghai him.
[00:55:48.103 --> 00:55:49.984]  They're trying to Buffalo him.
[00:55:49.984 --> 00:55:50.425]  And yes,
[00:55:51.880 --> 00:55:53.921]  Owen's been sued by the Deep State.
[00:55:53.921 --> 00:55:55.521]  I've been sued by the Deep State.
[00:55:55.521 --> 00:55:57.062]  Infowars is fighting all of that.
[00:55:57.062 --> 00:56:04.284]  And that's why when you buy the coffee, and that's why when you buy your good fish oil from us, you buy your good Nutrebox from us and X2 that just came back in.
[00:56:04.284 --> 00:56:07.245]  It takes a lot of money to have the security and the people to do this.
[00:56:07.245 --> 00:56:09.706]  You see us expanding in the face of the globalists.
[00:56:09.706 --> 00:56:12.167]  And that's because I've taken the savings I had as backup.
[00:56:12.927 --> 00:56:15.368]  Mortgage my house and I'm just all in 2020.
[00:56:15.368 --> 00:56:16.509]  And I'm not complaining.
[00:56:16.509 --> 00:56:17.049]  I love it.
[00:56:17.049 --> 00:56:17.970]  They put a gun to my head.
[00:56:17.970 --> 00:56:19.051]  I'm not gonna back down.
[00:56:19.051 --> 00:56:21.732]  I'm just saying, InfoWars needs the full boost.
[00:56:21.732 --> 00:56:23.313]  You need this full boost.
[00:56:23.313 --> 00:56:24.554]  Step into the plate.
[00:56:24.554 --> 00:56:25.734]  InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:56:25.734 --> 00:56:26.695]  Get Ultimate Fish Roll.
[00:56:26.695 --> 00:56:27.735]  It's about to go off sale.
[00:56:27.735 --> 00:56:29.316]  This is in close to selling out.
[00:56:29.316 --> 00:56:30.937]  X2, that is the good halogen.
[00:56:30.937 --> 00:56:32.918]  Let me just show TV viewers.
[00:56:32.918 --> 00:56:36.360]  Let me just show TV viewers one thing here.
[00:56:36.360 --> 00:56:37.961]  I've got it in one of my folders.
[00:56:37.961 --> 00:56:40.963]  Okay, this is from the Journal of American Medicine.
[00:56:41.860 --> 00:56:46.102]  Club Med, all of it, right here.
[00:56:46.102 --> 00:57:00.190]  According to the World Health Organization, nearly 2 million individuals have insufficient iodine intake, a third of being school age, and it goes on to say it's the leading cause of intellectual disability.
[00:57:00.190 --> 00:57:02.291]  The number one cause on the planet
[00:57:03.680 --> 00:57:08.542]  And we're selling you the best, cleanest, purest form, unbound in its atomic form.
[00:57:08.542 --> 00:57:10.163]  Nobody else sells it like this.
[00:57:10.163 --> 00:57:20.568]  Now, we have another one that is mainly deep-earth crystal, but two other types of clean iodine that help some people upload it, and some people like that type better.
[00:57:20.568 --> 00:57:21.328]  It's apples and oranges.
[00:57:21.328 --> 00:57:22.489]  It's your physiology.
[00:57:22.489 --> 00:57:24.009]  They're both 40% off.
[00:57:24.009 --> 00:57:25.990]  Infoworkstore.com.
[00:57:25.990 --> 00:57:27.571]  X3, we got a few months left of it.
[00:57:27.571 --> 00:57:29.252]  We're going to have to put another big order in.
[00:57:29.252 --> 00:57:30.532]  But X2 just came back in 98%.
[00:57:32.173 --> 00:57:33.674]  Reviews on third-party sites.
[00:57:33.674 --> 00:57:36.155]  Six thousand plus reviews.
[00:57:36.155 --> 00:57:36.935]  Ninety-eight percent.
[00:57:36.935 --> 00:57:37.976]  Changed my life.
[00:57:37.976 --> 00:57:38.956]  It's the opposite of fluoride.
[00:57:38.956 --> 00:57:41.297]  It's what the globals don't want you to have, and it funds the InfoWar.
[00:57:41.297 --> 00:57:42.258]  A total 360 win.
[00:57:42.258 --> 00:57:44.459]  You're crazy if you don't get it for yourself and your family.
[00:57:44.459 --> 00:57:45.319]  Take action now.
[00:57:45.319 --> 00:57:46.460]  InfoWarStore.com
[00:57:47.765 --> 00:57:53.591]  I wanted to talk about Super Silver whitening toothpaste because I hadn't tried it except for maybe the last week and a half.
[00:57:53.591 --> 00:57:57.135]  And I told Alex, I said, man, this is the best toothpaste I've ever tried.
[00:57:57.135 --> 00:57:59.438]  He's like, well, what are you doing just sitting in here telling me?
[00:57:59.438 --> 00:58:01.280]  You got to get up there and tell people.
[00:58:01.280 --> 00:58:02.882]  So here I am telling people.
[00:58:03.622 --> 00:58:13.769]  Super Silver Whitening Toothpaste is by far the best toothpaste I've ever tried and I'm 45 years old and I've tried a lot of different toothpaste and it's fluoride free.
[00:58:13.769 --> 00:58:25.297]  I think the big difference, the game changer in this is the Coral Calcium because after I brush my teeth with this, they feel so clean and the toothpaste, I don't even like rinse out my mouth after I brush my teeth with this.
[00:58:25.297 --> 00:58:26.578]  It feels so good.
[00:58:26.578 --> 00:58:30.740]  It feels like good things are happening in my mouth.
[00:58:30.740 --> 00:58:33.042]  In fact, I find myself brushing my teeth
[00:58:33.783 --> 00:58:36.931]  Three to four times a day rather than just twice a day now.
[00:58:36.931 --> 00:58:38.595]  Because I like the way it feels.
[00:58:49.628 --> 00:58:53.291]  It's time to take a new, healthier approach to one of your most basic needs.
[00:58:53.291 --> 00:59:00.356]  The Alexa Pure Pro water filtration system is the same water filter that Alex and the Infowars crew use every day for the purest water possible.

[00:59:44.255 --> 00:59:46.156]  Remember, we're all part of the fight.
[00:59:46.156 --> 00:59:48.497]  InfoWars, brought to you by you.
[00:59:51.886 --> 01:00:05.736]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:05.736 --> 01:00:11.640]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:00:31.962 --> 01:00:37.688]  Owen Schroyer is with us for another two segments and I want to cover the waterfront with him.
[01:00:37.688 --> 01:00:41.552]  What the Virginia historic gun rally was like and how it blew up at the establishment's face.
[01:00:41.552 --> 01:00:42.493]  How amazing that was.
[01:00:42.493 --> 01:00:43.834]  What do you think they'll do next?
[01:00:43.834 --> 01:00:46.276]  I want to get into the ongoing
[01:00:47.137 --> 01:00:47.858]  See you next time.
[01:01:09.795 --> 01:01:16.281]  And we're going to take your calls, get into the new coronavirus, and is it a super pandemic?
[01:01:16.281 --> 01:01:25.089]  How mysterious is it that they've been developing this vaccine and suddenly it gets approved with the patent and then this happens?
[01:01:25.089 --> 01:01:26.870]  We're going to talk about it all here today.
[01:01:26.870 --> 01:01:28.511]  And as I said, open the phones up.
[01:01:28.511 --> 01:01:30.613]  But right now, let's go back to Owen Schroer.
[01:01:30.613 --> 01:01:33.976]  Owen, finishing up with the court hearing and the railroading.
[01:01:33.976 --> 01:01:35.578]  I was talking to you during the break.
[01:01:36.647 --> 01:01:37.167]  Yeah, very abnormal.
[01:01:37.167 --> 01:01:43.872]  And to be clear, it wasn't the judge, it was the state prosecuting attorney that kept having to leave the courtroom and get on the phone to talk to the higher-ups.
[01:02:02.871 --> 01:02:12.417]  And the only way that you can even have this order against you to be off Capitol grounds is if it comes directly from Congress.
[01:02:12.417 --> 01:02:14.518]  So this has to be coming from Congress.
[01:02:14.518 --> 01:02:16.899]  Now who, you know, we're left to guess.
[01:02:16.899 --> 01:02:20.021]  I think we can make a fair estimate here or the audience can make a fair estimate.
[01:02:20.021 --> 01:02:26.925]  But Alex, let me just say something before I get back into the nuts and bolts of this and what this is really illustrating here.
[01:02:26.925 --> 01:02:30.847]  We have a two-tier justice system in this country.
[01:02:31.502 --> 01:02:33.523]  And that's what this is illustrating right now.
[01:02:33.523 --> 01:02:39.187]  If you're a Democrat, liberal, progressive, and you work with the Democrat Party, you're off the hook!
[01:02:39.187 --> 01:02:43.549]  You don't have to go to court, you don't have to go to jail, you don't get arrested, you don't get a record.
[01:02:43.549 --> 01:02:45.551]  Just look at Jane Fonda doing it every day.
[01:02:45.551 --> 01:02:48.973]  There's not even a paper trail of her ever being arrested.
[01:02:48.973 --> 01:02:51.154]  But she has done this dozens of times.
[01:02:51.684 --> 01:02:58.928]  If you're Jerry Nadler and you sit up there and obstruct Congress, or say, oh, how dare Trump obstruct our fake impeachment hoax against him?
[01:02:58.928 --> 01:03:20.721]  And they make up a bunch of things, they pay protesters to come out here that have no idea what the impeachment is even about, but oh my gosh, if you're one lowly peon, if you're one tiny little ant, one little citizen, that dare stand up for your rights, that dare stand up to the hated Trump- But Owen, let's just say this, obviously this came from Nadler, and I'm not normally gay, but he is one hot man.
[01:03:24.938 --> 01:03:29.623]  Uh, you know what, I'm not attracted to Oompa Loompas, Alex, so I'm not going to comment on that.
[01:03:29.623 --> 01:03:32.265]  Oompa Loompas are attractive compared to this guy.
[01:03:32.265 --> 01:03:38.851]  He looks like he ate the Constitution and about a hundred children at the same time as, like, side hors d'oeuvres.
[01:03:38.851 --> 01:03:44.676]  I mean, nothing against fat people, but my God, he is the most ridiculous looking person I've ever seen.
[01:03:44.676 --> 01:03:48.400]  And then on top of the arrogance and the insolence, I mean, what a joke.
[01:03:50.270 --> 01:03:53.853]  But Alex, they're showing their weakness.
[01:03:53.853 --> 01:03:56.274]  Their weakness is civil disobedience.
[01:03:56.274 --> 01:03:58.616]  Their weakness is people taking action.
[01:03:58.616 --> 01:04:01.598]  I just happen to be the one that does it and gets the viral video.
[01:04:01.598 --> 01:04:02.739]  That's their weakness.
[01:04:02.739 --> 01:04:04.981]  That's why they're trying to make an example out of me.
[01:04:04.981 --> 01:04:06.902]  That's why they're trying to hang me in the public square.
[01:04:06.902 --> 01:04:09.524]  Because they want to intimidate all the American citizens.
[01:04:10.194 --> 01:04:18.124]  Out of their free speech, they want to say, if you dare take a stand, we're going to arrest you and tarnish your name and drag you through court and ban you from Capitol Grounds.
[01:04:18.124 --> 01:04:21.749]  And you won't even have free speech, you little peon slave.
[01:04:21.749 --> 01:04:22.550]  That's what they want to do.
[01:04:22.550 --> 01:04:24.953]  They're trying to intimidate people out of their free speech, Alex.
[01:04:26.596 --> 01:04:32.460]  They want to create the projection that everybody agrees with the Democrats and they speak for the people, but that backfires on them every time.
[01:04:32.460 --> 01:04:39.386]  That's why everybody needs to go to Congress and not go into the chambers and do it, but legally and lawfully in the halls, talk to your representatives.
[01:04:39.386 --> 01:04:40.427]  That's not illegal.
[01:04:40.427 --> 01:04:42.228]  That's civic virtue.
[01:04:42.228 --> 01:04:46.932]  And that's a good thing because these representatives, the Democrats, are a bunch of out-of-control criminals.
[01:04:46.932 --> 01:04:51.235]  We need to use the First Amendment to stop them starting a civil war.
[01:04:51.235 --> 01:04:52.636]  Then we have to use the Second Amendment.
[01:04:52.636 --> 01:04:54.197]  None of us want that to happen.
[01:04:54.197 --> 01:04:55.078]  So let's fight hard now.
[01:04:56.812 --> 01:05:00.654]  Since the beginning, Seeker 12 has been one of our most popular formulas.

[01:05:59.752 --> 01:06:02.434]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:06:02.434 --> 01:06:07.538]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[01:06:28.991 --> 01:06:35.274]  Owen Schroyer joins us from right outside the White House in Washington, D.C.
[01:06:35.274 --> 01:06:37.875]  He was just in court today.
[01:06:37.875 --> 01:06:47.560]  Democrats, when they go soros astroturf and throw themselves down and take over congressional hearings for hours on end, they're praised as wonderful activists.
[01:06:47.560 --> 01:06:53.223]  CNN, MSNBC, the memes are out there showing us heroes and great job at the Kavanaugh hearings.
[01:06:54.864 --> 01:07:15.820]  But when Owen Schroyer politely, but focused, says, no, you're the ones involved in treason, this is all a charade of fraud, for like 30 seconds goes out, the police are letting him go, and all of a sudden, oh wait, no, no, you're going to jail, you're having the book thrown at you, and then today, the judge didn't give him a $500 fine or something and say don't do it again, which is what they do rarely.
[01:07:15.820 --> 01:07:18.322]  That's the extreme end of prosecution.
[01:07:18.322 --> 01:07:20.423]  They said, you're getting drug tested, you're going to prison.
[01:07:21.698 --> 01:07:30.566]  Prosecutors on the phone with Congress and by law only members of Congress at executive levels can call for someone to be completely banned.
[01:07:30.566 --> 01:07:40.795]  And the Democrats called for Infowars reporter Owen Schroer to be banned and openly called for him to not be able to go around and even interview people basically in Congress.
[01:07:40.795 --> 01:07:42.196]  Totally unconstitutional.
[01:07:42.196 --> 01:07:44.117]  We got to file an injunction on this.
[01:07:44.117 --> 01:07:45.639]  Norm Pattis is my great First Amendment lawyer.
[01:07:45.939 --> 01:07:50.382]  Yeah, again Alex, this is just illustrative of what our government thinks about us.
[01:07:50.382 --> 01:07:51.643]  Unless, of course, you're a liberal Democrat.
[01:08:01.260 --> 01:08:05.264]  Then you have carte blanche to disrupt Congress or do whatever the hell you want.
[01:08:05.264 --> 01:08:13.933]  But if you're a God-fearing, freedom-loving American patriot, well then you are the kryptonite of the corrupt government and so they must shut you down.
[01:08:13.933 --> 01:08:20.500]  But yes, Alex, they tried to ban me from all Capitol buildings and government offices and congressional offices.
[01:08:20.840 --> 01:08:22.841]  We fought that at the first court level.
[01:08:22.841 --> 01:08:25.483]  We moved up to another administrative court level.
[01:08:25.483 --> 01:08:26.843]  A second judge heard us.
[01:08:26.843 --> 01:08:30.946]  A second state prosecutor brought the exact same thing, trying to shut me down.
[01:08:30.946 --> 01:08:45.413]  This judge said, absolutely not, that's a First Amendment right, but we will issue a no-hats order, which basically gags me inside Senate chambers so that I can't speak, or as they want, not raise the truth in a very powerful manner.
[01:08:45.413 --> 01:08:48.555]  And so, what's shocking to me about this too, Alex, is that
[01:08:49.778 --> 01:08:53.299]  How many people are witnessing this just in the chain of command?
[01:08:53.299 --> 01:08:56.020]  Just seeing this corruption and just going along with it?
[01:08:56.020 --> 01:08:57.480]  And not raising hell about it?
[01:08:57.480 --> 01:08:58.460]  And not saying, you know what?
[01:08:58.460 --> 01:09:01.961]  No, I'm not going to be part of an unconstitutional order from Congress.
[01:09:01.961 --> 01:09:05.642]  No, I'm not going to be part of an anti-free speech order from Congress.
[01:09:05.642 --> 01:09:16.205]  No, I'm not going to take part in a two-tiered justice system where the celebrity failed actor Jane Fonda gets to get arrested dozens of times and then doesn't even have a paper trail because it never even makes it
[01:09:16.445 --> 01:09:17.086]  To the D.C.
[01:09:17.086 --> 01:09:18.790]  police or to the courthouse.
[01:09:18.790 --> 01:09:19.651]  So that's incredible.
[01:09:19.651 --> 01:09:21.956]  But again, folks need to understand.
[01:09:22.386 --> 01:09:23.506]  This is their kryptonite.
[01:09:23.506 --> 01:09:26.487]  What happened in Virginia on Monday is their kryptonite.
[01:09:26.487 --> 01:09:29.768]  What I did in Congress to Jerry Nadler is their kryptonite.
[01:09:29.768 --> 01:09:31.268]  That's why they're trying to shut it down.
[01:09:31.268 --> 01:09:34.589]  That's why they tried to intimidate us from rallying in Virginia.
[01:09:34.589 --> 01:09:39.730]  That's why they're trying to make an example out of me so that you won't go up there and stand up to your congressman.
[01:09:39.730 --> 01:09:41.310]  It's all totally illegal.
[01:09:41.310 --> 01:09:43.411]  It's all totally unconstitutional.
[01:09:43.411 --> 01:09:44.991]  It's all anti-free speech.
[01:09:44.991 --> 01:09:46.592]  And this is what the Democrats are doing right now.
[01:09:46.592 --> 01:09:48.412]  It no holds barred.
[01:09:48.972 --> 01:09:50.293]  It's no holds barred right now.
[01:09:50.293 --> 01:09:54.315]  And look, I understand this isn't... I'm not going to sit here and say, oh Trump, save me.
[01:09:54.315 --> 01:09:57.097]  But President Trump needs to realize how important this is.
[01:09:57.097 --> 01:10:00.619]  And I understand he's got trade deals and he's trying to stop illegal immigration.
[01:10:00.619 --> 01:10:04.542]  And he's trying to do all the stuff with the deep state that he's dealing with, which we probably can't even imagine.
[01:10:04.542 --> 01:10:08.224]  But he needs to understand his supporters are being choked out right now.
[01:10:08.809 --> 01:10:16.415]  They're being put in a chokehold by these Democrats in Congress and by the mainstream news and by this social media tech giant.
[01:10:16.415 --> 01:10:19.677]  And if he doesn't do something about it, we're all going to get choked out.
[01:10:19.677 --> 01:10:22.379]  And he's not going to have anybody voicing support for him.
[01:10:22.379 --> 01:10:25.502]  So he really needs to continue the hammer on this.
[01:10:25.862 --> 01:10:29.124]  He needs to say, hey look, what you did to Roger Stone was illegal.
[01:10:29.124 --> 01:10:31.566]  Hey, what you did to Mike Flynn was illegal.
[01:10:31.566 --> 01:10:33.627]  You guys are running the impeachment scam.
[01:10:33.627 --> 01:10:35.528]  You guys are the ones that framed evidence.
[01:10:35.528 --> 01:10:37.389]  You guys are the ones that spied illegally.
[01:10:37.389 --> 01:10:40.071]  Let's put you on trial, Barack Obama.
[01:10:40.071 --> 01:10:43.553]  Let's put you on trial, James Clapper and Jim Comey.
[01:10:43.553 --> 01:10:45.494]  Let's look at the perjury that you committed.
[01:10:45.814 --> 01:10:48.775]  And so, the day we get that, maybe it's the day we get justice.
[01:10:48.775 --> 01:10:59.159]  But until then, Americans are going to have to keep scratching and clawing for justice, and really just making an example of everything that we have to put up with as second-class citizens in the United States of America.
[01:10:59.159 --> 01:11:02.100]  Which, quite frankly, Alex, has me boiling inside.
[01:11:02.100 --> 01:11:08.482]  But I've given this up to God, and I'm praying to God for the patience and the guidance to handle this in the best manner I possibly can.
[01:11:08.482 --> 01:11:11.343]  And I trust that God is going to give me that guidance.
[01:11:11.343 --> 01:11:14.044]  And hopefully, hopefully,
[01:11:14.835 --> 01:11:16.698]  Mainstream news will cover this story.
[01:11:16.698 --> 01:11:21.988]  And of course, we're not counting on CNN or MSNBC or the Outfit Network, but maybe a Fox News hit.
[01:11:22.697 --> 01:11:24.638]  Maybe a Fox News hit would be nice.
[01:11:24.638 --> 01:11:26.878]  We know President Trump watches Fox News.
[01:11:26.878 --> 01:11:34.921]  We know they have the top ratings on cable news, but they don't want to touch InfoWars either because they're still scared to death of you, the audience, calling out the truth.
[01:11:34.921 --> 01:11:37.302]  So we got a lot of developments coming again.
[01:11:37.302 --> 01:11:42.383]  I'm due back in court next week, so I'll have more answers then as to how this is going to go.
[01:11:42.383 --> 01:11:43.304]  But this is what you get.
[01:11:43.304 --> 01:11:46.165]  You're treated like a second class citizen in this country.
[01:11:46.165 --> 01:11:47.065]  If you're a God-fearing
[01:11:47.305 --> 01:11:49.106]  Well Owen, what you're saying is...
[01:12:13.442 --> 01:12:16.863]  Oh, and we can't adapt to submission.
[01:12:16.863 --> 01:12:19.244]  We have to adapt to overcoming.
[01:12:19.244 --> 01:12:21.325]  And we don't need Fox News.
[01:12:21.325 --> 01:12:30.449]  We need them to recognize the attacks on speech, to rally America, and to make it one of the central issues that only Tucker Carlson is doing.
[01:12:30.449 --> 01:12:32.130]  And he's like the conscience of America right now.
[01:12:33.070 --> 01:12:35.971]  And we need the American people to understand this is front and center.
[01:12:35.971 --> 01:12:37.751]  And we need the President to do it.
[01:12:37.751 --> 01:12:38.932]  Because that's what's happening.
[01:12:38.932 --> 01:12:40.292]  The power comes from the people.
[01:12:40.292 --> 01:12:49.215]  And you're right, the kryptonite of their tyranny was all those peaceful citizens coming together in mass and peacefully exercising their First and Second Amendment in Virginia.
[01:12:49.215 --> 01:12:51.716]  And what the Governor predicted didn't happen.
[01:12:51.716 --> 01:12:54.556]  And that's the power of the people and the people taking action.
[01:12:54.556 --> 01:12:55.857]  But as you said,
[01:12:57.366 --> 01:13:09.971]  When you have Judicial Watch, and Breitbart, and Right Side Broadcasting, and a bunch of other people, who go and buy feeds that anybody can do.
[01:13:09.971 --> 01:13:11.892]  HD feeds.
[01:13:11.892 --> 01:13:14.493]  Some events are expensive, some are cheap.
[01:13:14.493 --> 01:13:18.115]  You can go get for the cost, pool footage, live feed.
[01:13:18.115 --> 01:13:22.236]  Anybody can call up, do it, have it connected to their terminal, their computer, restream it.
[01:13:22.236 --> 01:13:22.396]  Okay?
[01:13:22.396 --> 01:13:23.557]  You have a million subscribers.
[01:13:25.086 --> 01:13:42.165]  And when they did that, YouTube guaranteed, had CNN contact them, but it's in the news that they said this is a community guidelines violation and banned a bunch of conservative groups like Judicial Watch from carrying their own feed so they could talk over it and have their own commentary.
[01:13:42.165 --> 01:13:43.526]  They don't want our analysis.
[01:13:43.526 --> 01:13:45.228]  They want only dinosaur media.
[01:13:46.149 --> 01:13:49.493]  To have that, and that's racketeering, that's organized crime.
[01:13:49.493 --> 01:13:53.997]  So I say to Judicial Watch, do something about the attacks on speech.
[01:13:53.997 --> 01:13:55.499]  Now, Professor Epstein.
[01:13:56.897 --> 01:13:59.299]  It's saying, yeah, he thinks his wife was probably murdered.
[01:13:59.299 --> 01:14:02.341]  And I can't tell you the behind-the-scenes stuff going on with Epstein.
[01:14:02.341 --> 01:14:03.862]  I'm just going to leave it at that.
[01:14:03.862 --> 01:14:06.763]  But I can tell you that I was waiting for him to say that.
[01:14:06.763 --> 01:14:09.105]  And I can tell you he's been thinking that day one.
[01:14:09.105 --> 01:14:10.546]  And I can tell you there's some other stuff involved.
[01:14:10.546 --> 01:14:13.007]  But all big tech's got to do is dial into the new cars.
[01:14:13.007 --> 01:14:16.089]  They can take control of them and drive you right off the cliff if they want.
[01:14:16.089 --> 01:14:19.772]  And so that's what we've been telling Epstein.
[01:14:19.772 --> 01:14:24.195]  Before we go to break, because this is very key, we switched courts.
[01:14:24.195 --> 01:14:24.715]  We literally
[01:14:25.265 --> 01:14:27.266]  Switched courts after the first trial.
[01:14:27.266 --> 01:14:30.788]  So we moved up, new judge, new prosecuting attorney.
[01:14:30.788 --> 01:14:36.452]  So this prosecuting attorney would have no inference as to who I am or what I was doing there.
[01:14:36.452 --> 01:14:38.133]  He just gets this handed down.
[01:14:38.133 --> 01:14:39.534]  But you know what he did?
[01:14:39.534 --> 01:14:49.000]  He brought up to the judge the video from yesterday that wasn't even my video, it was Rob Dew's video of me confronting the impeached Trump protesters and he used that
[01:14:49.620 --> 01:14:53.984]  As a case against me to say, see, he can't be allowed in these buildings.
[01:14:53.984 --> 01:14:55.525]  He just did this yesterday, too.
[01:14:55.525 --> 01:14:57.046]  Even though I broke no laws yesterday.
[01:14:57.046 --> 01:14:58.728]  I didn't, there was no laws broken.
[01:14:58.728 --> 01:14:59.949]  I even talked to the Capitol Police over there.
[01:14:59.949 --> 01:15:01.870]  No, all you did was show they're out there chanting.
[01:15:01.870 --> 01:15:03.472]  They're out there having their events.
[01:15:03.472 --> 01:15:04.913]  You reported on them.
[01:15:04.913 --> 01:15:07.475]  And you did it, and so it got all over the news.
[01:15:07.475 --> 01:15:08.756]  And it got a whole bunch of views.
[01:15:08.756 --> 01:15:12.479]  And so being successful, being effective, is what they want to silence.
[01:15:12.479 --> 01:15:14.961]  That is disgusting what that prosecutor did.
[01:15:14.961 --> 01:15:16.863]  And it should all be thrown out right there.
[01:15:16.863 --> 01:15:18.204]  What did the judge do when they said that?
[01:15:19.930 --> 01:15:22.673]  Again, the judge said this is a violation of the First Amendment.
[01:15:22.673 --> 01:15:24.614]  I'm not going to ban him from any Capitol buildings.
[01:15:24.614 --> 01:15:26.376]  I'm not going to ban him from Congressional offices.
[01:15:26.376 --> 01:15:27.737]  He has every right to be there.
[01:15:27.737 --> 01:15:31.901]  He doesn't have a criminal record that would indicate he has any abusive behavior.
[01:15:31.901 --> 01:15:36.125]  But again, Alex, this shows you they're literally monitoring everything we do.
[01:15:36.125 --> 01:15:40.749]  Someone called up this prosecutor who just got this case handed to him and said, bring up the video we had yesterday.
[01:15:40.749 --> 01:15:42.050]  Bring up that he's still doing this.
[01:15:42.050 --> 01:15:43.091]  So they're literally getting
[01:15:43.311 --> 01:15:46.455]  Because they don't want the American people to have any voice.
[01:15:46.455 --> 01:15:47.777]  Great job, Owen Schroer.
[01:15:47.777 --> 01:15:51.282]  Watch all his live videos as they get filed at BAN.VIDEO.
[01:15:51.282 --> 01:15:52.123]  Great job, Owen.
[01:15:52.123 --> 01:15:53.385]  We'll talk to you again soon.
[01:15:53.385 --> 01:15:53.926]  And Savannah.
[01:15:56.112 --> 01:15:58.074]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[01:15:58.074 --> 01:16:03.398]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you.
[01:16:03.398 --> 01:16:04.980]  But the symptoms are there.
[01:16:04.980 --> 01:16:13.327]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[01:16:13.327 --> 01:16:19.032]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[01:16:19.192 --> 01:16:21.013]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[01:16:21.013 --> 01:16:23.294]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[01:16:23.294 --> 01:16:27.677]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[01:16:27.677 --> 01:16:29.878]  I recommend Heart and Body Extract to everyone.
[01:16:29.878 --> 01:16:37.622]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.

[01:17:21.966 --> 01:17:23.747]  Not a security IPO or note.

[01:17:48.695 --> 01:18:03.565]  With the daily wear and tear of the environment on our skin, it's only natural that it starts to crack and take damage.

[01:18:57.153 --> 01:19:07.244]  It is I, the leader of Cobra, here for a message to President Trump, the American people, and Alex Jones of InfoWars.
[01:19:07.244 --> 01:19:13.230]  Our operations with our partners, the Communist Chinese, have bought control of your media.
[01:19:13.230 --> 01:19:17.595]  But, it's true, your people are beginning to awaken.
[01:19:18.215 --> 01:19:29.727]  That's why Cobra is launching operations to trigger race war, mass shootings and bombings, which will be blamed on those loyal to America.
[01:19:29.727 --> 01:19:36.694]  Anyone, once we stage these attacks, that does not blame it on Trump will also be targeted by Cobra.
[01:19:40.370 --> 01:19:53.978]  See, when you expose our false flags and fake media, I will carry out attacks and then blame you, like we've done with Alex Jones, blaming him for mass shootings we committed!
[01:19:53.978 --> 01:19:55.139]  Ha ha!
[01:19:55.139 --> 01:19:59.321]  Hail Cobra!
[01:19:59.321 --> 01:20:01.963]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:39.795 --> 01:20:41.797]  Remember what Pelosi said two years ago.
[01:20:41.797 --> 01:20:46.420]  We were always going to impeach Trump from the beginning.
[01:20:46.420 --> 01:20:50.963]  One of the biggest criticisms of the process has been the speed at which the House Democrats are moving.
[01:20:50.963 --> 01:20:53.565]  But seriously though, seriously.
[01:20:53.565 --> 01:20:56.507]  It's been going on for 22 months, okay?
[01:20:56.507 --> 01:20:58.229]  Two and a half years.
[01:21:00.157 --> 01:21:05.359]  So there you go, it's all premeditated, it's all a fraud, it's all a big joke, and that's always been their goal.
[01:21:05.359 --> 01:21:11.821]  And so now, after stalling a few more days with wrangling, the trial has officially begun.
[01:21:11.821 --> 01:21:19.024]  As we speak, let's go to what's happening currently live, and then Savannah Hernandez right outside Congress to give her take.
[01:21:19.024 --> 01:21:19.364]  Here it is.
[01:21:20.572 --> 01:21:20.852]  It's live.
[01:21:20.852 --> 01:21:21.912]  It's always shift.
[01:21:21.912 --> 01:21:24.713]  The Democrats have had like 90% of the talk time.
[01:21:24.713 --> 01:21:28.114]  Trump's never been able to put on his defense yet.
[01:21:28.114 --> 01:21:30.554]  He gets two days next week to do it.
[01:21:30.554 --> 01:21:30.874]  And it's shift!
[01:21:30.874 --> 01:21:33.795]  The Russians reportedly hacked into the energy company
[01:21:49.150 --> 01:21:56.974]  That Hunter Biden's involved in, so it's okay what he did because somebody reports out of their rear end!
[01:21:56.974 --> 01:21:58.455]  It's all innuendo.
[01:21:58.455 --> 01:21:59.715]  Holy Toledo.
[01:21:59.715 --> 01:22:02.637]  Let's go back live to ship and see what the new BS is.
[01:22:03.712 --> 01:22:19.163]  It's looking for information related to the former Vice President's son, so that the Kremlin could also weaponize it against Mr. Biden, just like it did against Hillary Clinton in 2016, when Russia hacked and released emails from her presidential campaign.
[01:22:19.163 --> 01:22:22.425]  So they're merging Russia-gate that's already failed with Ukraine-gate.
[01:22:22.425 --> 01:22:24.407]  It's just the same BS again.
[01:22:24.407 --> 01:22:25.627]  Please continue, Jeff.
[01:22:25.627 --> 01:22:29.970]  And President Trump has made it abundantly clear that he would like nothing more
[01:22:30.967 --> 01:22:37.794]  Then to make use of such dirt against Mr. Biden just as he made use of Secretary Clinton's hacked and released emails.
[01:22:37.794 --> 01:22:42.079]  Yeah, her criminal activity is her criminal activity regardless of where it comes from.
[01:22:42.079 --> 01:22:49.207]  What's amazing is they have House and Senate hearings where they say I'm a Russian agent with no proof and I don't get to face my accusers.
[01:22:50.014 --> 01:22:51.295]  And Owen was freaking out.
[01:22:51.295 --> 01:22:59.023]  He's going to different courtrooms, and the prosecutors are there going, this man was interviewing people at the Capitol again yesterday.
[01:22:59.023 --> 01:23:01.565]  And the judge is like, well, that's totally normal.
[01:23:01.565 --> 01:23:07.191]  But they're trying to ban these people are tyrants, tyrannists.
[01:23:10.123 --> 01:23:18.951]  And thus the tyrants, as the logo in Virginia shows, the goddess with her leg on the neck of the tyrant who she slain.
[01:23:18.951 --> 01:23:23.256]  These people are tyrants, ladies and gentlemen, and I want to beat them in the information war.
[01:23:23.256 --> 01:23:25.578]  That's why they want a physical war, because they know we're winning.
[01:23:25.578 --> 01:23:27.159]  Let's go back and hear more from Shiv!
[01:23:27.159 --> 01:23:28.160]  We haven't heard enough from him!
[01:23:28.160 --> 01:23:32.624]  That President Trump demanded that the Ukrainian leader announce.
[01:23:33.649 --> 01:23:44.072]  This investigation was related to a debunked conspiracy theory alleging that Ukraine, not Russia, interfered in the 2016 presidential election.
[01:23:44.072 --> 01:23:59.597]  This narrative, propagated by the Russian intelligence services, contends that Ukraine sought to help Hillary Clinton and harm then-candidate Trump, and that a computer server providing this fiction is hidden somewhere in Ukraine.
[01:24:01.411 --> 01:24:02.592]  That is the so-called crowd strike.
[01:24:02.592 --> 01:24:04.733]  Alright, I can't listen anymore, but I'm not going to go over the whole issue of this.
[01:24:04.733 --> 01:24:08.196]  Everybody knows that the Deep State's been laundering billions a year through Ukraine.
[01:24:08.196 --> 01:24:09.637]  That goes right back to Soros.
[01:24:09.637 --> 01:24:13.399]  That's then paid back to Deep State government employees and their wives and husbands.
[01:24:13.399 --> 01:24:27.149]  And that the dossier is up to $47 million now, passed around for a year of the election, and now three years after, to the friends and family, where some of them are paid over a million apiece to add innuendo and crap to it.
[01:24:27.149 --> 01:24:30.511]  Like, oh, there's hookers pissing on him, and, you know, pigs flying out of his...
[01:24:31.638 --> 01:24:32.338]  You know where?
[01:24:32.338 --> 01:24:35.901]  I mean, it's unbelievable!
[01:24:35.901 --> 01:24:39.943]  The rape of justice, the rape of due process.
[01:24:39.943 --> 01:24:45.586]  I am a Russian agent like I'm a Chinese jet pilot from Mars.
[01:24:45.586 --> 01:24:46.427]  And so is Trump.
[01:24:48.140 --> 01:24:57.649]  If Trump's done anything, it's been militaristically kicking the snot out of the Russians and putting sanctions on them and pushing up on Russia's borders with weapons, which is terrible.
[01:24:57.649 --> 01:25:00.032]  China is what's crawling all over us right now.
[01:25:00.032 --> 01:25:02.594]  If Russia was doing anything to us, I'd be in Russia's face.
[01:25:02.594 --> 01:25:05.797]  Just not true.
[01:25:05.797 --> 01:25:07.619]  Savannah Hernandez has been in D.C.
[01:25:07.619 --> 01:25:09.241]  for a week.
[01:25:09.241 --> 01:25:10.101]  She's been in Virginia.
[01:25:10.101 --> 01:25:11.262]  She's seen so much.
[01:25:12.509 --> 01:25:18.152]  And now to witness this, to be there, this history, Savannah, what's your top story?
[01:25:18.152 --> 01:25:19.472]  What's your big takeaway right now?
[01:25:19.472 --> 01:25:23.574]  Hi Alex.
[01:25:23.574 --> 01:25:26.276]  Well, that was perfect timing.
[01:25:26.276 --> 01:25:26.976]  Boom.
[01:25:26.976 --> 01:25:29.577]  So we'll get her back on a little bit later.
[01:25:29.577 --> 01:25:39.162]  Now, let me tell you what I want to get to here today, ladies and gentlemen, because there is a lot on our plate.
[01:25:39.162 --> 01:25:41.023]  A lot that we're going to be breaking down.
[01:25:42.551 --> 01:25:45.496]  It's a new story that's very, very important.
[01:25:45.496 --> 01:25:45.876]  We're done.
[01:25:45.876 --> 01:25:46.397]  It's okay.
[01:25:46.397 --> 01:25:47.178]  We'll do it later.
[01:25:47.178 --> 01:25:47.679]  We're done now.
[01:25:47.679 --> 01:25:48.560]  Let's shut this down.
[01:25:48.560 --> 01:25:50.123]  Thanks, guys.
[01:25:50.123 --> 01:25:56.333]  Chinese virus mutation draws comparison to 12 Monkeys movie.
[01:25:59.901 --> 01:26:07.264]  And boy does it, and the fact that it was just recently patented for vaccine is just special, isn't it?
[01:26:07.264 --> 01:26:10.626]  We're going to be getting to all of that when we come back.
[01:26:10.626 --> 01:26:17.608]  Also, Trump calls out Greta for staying silent about China and India pollution.
[01:26:17.608 --> 01:26:20.710]  Yeah, that's where 90% of it comes from India and China.
[01:26:20.710 --> 01:26:22.410]  That's admitted.
[01:26:22.410 --> 01:26:25.592]  Almost all the garbage in the ocean is purposely dumped by China.
[01:26:26.513 --> 01:26:31.496]  But you'd never know that, and no celebrity will say a word, because China is G.O.D.
[01:26:31.496 --> 01:26:33.017]  to the left.
[01:26:33.017 --> 01:26:37.040]  Godless, authoritarian, anti-Christian, running giant death camps.
[01:26:37.040 --> 01:26:38.060]  Couldn't be better.
[01:26:38.060 --> 01:26:46.085]  So we'll get to Trump calling her out, but also her Hitlerian, I have warned you, I have told you, you need to panic!
[01:26:46.085 --> 01:26:48.907]  You must do what I say!
[01:26:48.907 --> 01:26:51.349]  And they don't even see how authoritarian and whacked out she is?
[01:26:52.278 --> 01:26:57.322]  Looks like she's 8 years old, she's 16, her dad now has been caught posing as her online.
[01:26:57.322 --> 01:26:59.123]  Of course it's the Antifa parents.
[01:26:59.123 --> 01:27:03.066]  They're both, say, they're Antifa.
[01:27:03.066 --> 01:27:16.936]  Swedish, whacked out, crazy leftist, with their brain damaged, vaccine head daughter, who looks like a concentration camp victim, running around sounding Hitlerian, even the accent.
[01:27:16.936 --> 01:27:18.838]  It's all just too insane.
[01:27:21.084 --> 01:27:35.027]  But I also want to look back on the big victories that we've had in Virginia and how everything the governor said was going to happen didn't happen, but he still declared his attempt to kettle everybody in together and cause some type of disaster failed.
[01:27:36.593 --> 01:27:43.196]  And they're now passing their semi-automatic gun bans, their red flag, killing due process laws.
[01:27:43.196 --> 01:27:44.676]  It's all on the verge of passing right now.
[01:27:44.676 --> 01:27:46.797]  We've got an update on that first.
[01:27:46.797 --> 01:27:49.078]  The good, the bad, and the ugly, when we come back.
[01:27:49.078 --> 01:27:59.942]  But please remember, as viewers and listeners, this isn't like, this is mainstream media, you receive the talking points and the BS, and we're funded by the globalists and big mega banks, Goldman Sachs, and the Chai Comps.
[01:27:59.942 --> 01:28:03.544]  InfoWars isn't just funded by you, it is you.
[01:28:03.544 --> 01:28:05.004]  You're the reason it's here.
[01:28:05.004 --> 01:28:05.805]  You're our sponsors.
[01:28:06.690 --> 01:28:09.613]  Leftists come up to me and scream and go, who's funding you?
[01:28:09.613 --> 01:28:10.894]  Because they're always funded by somebody.
[01:28:10.894 --> 01:28:14.617]  And I go, uh, these people all around me in Virginia.
[01:28:14.617 --> 01:28:18.480]  Almost everybody at that gun rally was a listener.
[01:28:18.480 --> 01:28:19.401]  Maybe one out of 200 people.
[01:28:21.072 --> 01:28:26.474]  Who said they were pro-gun, but say, Alex, I think you're embarrassing, or I wish you weren't here, or go back to your state, or whatever.
[01:28:26.474 --> 01:28:31.317]  As if people are trying to take my guns in Virginia, and they didn't try to take my guns here in Austin.
[01:28:31.317 --> 01:28:33.478]  It's all of us together, hang separate.
[01:28:33.478 --> 01:28:38.320]  I mean, people are awake, and it's beautiful, and to be out there in the middle of that was very empowering.
[01:28:38.320 --> 01:28:43.022]  One of the greatest days of my life, to be out there with those great Virginians, incredible people, and great Americans.
[01:28:43.542 --> 01:28:46.844]  So when we come back, we're going to lay it all out straight ahead.
[01:28:46.844 --> 01:28:48.345]  This is the Infowar.
[01:28:48.345 --> 01:28:49.606]  This is America.
[01:28:49.606 --> 01:28:53.588]  This is the pro-human resistance against the technocracy takeover.
[01:28:56.104 --> 01:28:57.324]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.
[01:28:57.324 --> 01:29:01.245]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[01:29:01.245 --> 01:29:02.785]  I sued the IRS and won.
[01:29:02.785 --> 01:29:05.726]  I beat the IRS then, and I've been beating them ever since.
[01:29:05.726 --> 01:29:11.287]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement, and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved.
[01:29:11.287 --> 01:29:12.487]  I can help you, too.
[01:29:12.487 --> 01:29:15.427]  If you owe taxes you can't pay, don't wait another day.
[01:29:15.427 --> 01:29:17.648]  There's no such thing as a hopeless tax case.
[01:29:17.648 --> 01:29:22.088]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX or go to my website, danpilla.com.
[01:29:22.088 --> 01:29:24.389]  That's danpilla.com, danpilla.com.
[01:29:25.789 --> 01:29:29.671]  Most of you know that heart disease is the number one silent killer in the U.S.
[01:29:29.671 --> 01:29:34.653]  What if I told you for just $54.95 a month, you could fight against heart disease naturally?
[01:29:34.653 --> 01:29:39.475]  At Heart and Body Extract, we've been helping thousands of people get back to a healthier heart.
[01:29:39.475 --> 01:29:40.815]  Don't just take my word for it.
[01:29:40.815 --> 01:29:44.597]  Check out all of the success stories at hbextract.com.
[01:29:44.597 --> 01:29:45.557]  Or to order, call 866-295-5305.
[01:29:45.557 --> 01:29:46.517]  That's 866-295-5305. hbextract.com.
[01:29:46.517 --> 01:29:48.798]  Don't risk it when you can take charge of it.
[01:29:57.014 --> 01:30:08.701]  If you understand why the globalists, why the servants of Satan, hate InfoWars, it's because we're awake, we're alive, we're passionate, and we're not giving up.
[01:30:08.701 --> 01:30:18.187]  That's why it's critical for those of us that are aware of the New World Order's plans to not get down when they attack us and they persecute us and they lie about us.
[01:30:18.187 --> 01:30:22.770]  That's what we should expect because we are hurting these scumbags.
[01:30:22.770 --> 01:30:24.411]  The globalists have literally sold their
[01:30:24.411 --> 01:30:25.011]  We're good to go.
[01:30:46.896 --> 01:30:49.478]  They fear the fact that we are alive.
[01:30:49.478 --> 01:30:52.579]  They fear the fact that we love God.
[01:30:52.579 --> 01:30:56.842]  And that's all we ever have to know, is that God is in charge.
[01:30:56.842 --> 01:31:00.984]  I would thank you for everything you've done for the Infowar, but I know you're like me.
[01:31:00.984 --> 01:31:02.245]  You don't want my thanks.
[01:31:02.865 --> 01:31:06.648]  You want victory over the globalists and these devil worship and child molesters.
[01:31:06.648 --> 01:31:09.111]  And you want them off your back and off your children's back.
[01:31:09.111 --> 01:31:09.991]  And you know what?
[01:31:09.991 --> 01:31:13.314]  I'm the same way and that's why we're on the same damn team.
[01:31:13.314 --> 01:31:22.642]  And it's why M4s has been delivering time and time again when it's clutch time to focus the people on taking action against the globalists.
[01:31:22.642 --> 01:31:24.043]  Because I'm committed to a future
[01:31:25.066 --> 01:31:26.347]  For humanity.
[01:31:26.347 --> 01:31:27.989]  And I know you are as well.
[01:31:27.989 --> 01:31:31.573]  So thank you in 2019 for standing with us because you are the Infowar.
[01:31:31.573 --> 01:31:36.097]  And I want to thank you for committing to stand with us in 2020 however you can.
[01:31:36.097 --> 01:31:42.704]  From the bottom of my heart, from my family, and from the great crew at Infowars, I want to thank you all because you are the Infowar.
[01:31:42.704 --> 01:31:44.806]  And you know that's not just words, that's reality.
[01:31:45.842 --> 01:31:47.466]  You have made history.
[01:31:47.466 --> 01:31:49.350]  We have made history together.
[01:31:49.350 --> 01:31:53.919]  Infowars.com only has power because of you.
[01:31:53.919 --> 01:31:55.743]  And I suggest you use it.
[01:31:57.650 --> 01:32:03.214]  25 years ago when I first began broadcasting, I was a realist and I was honest with the listeners.
[01:32:03.214 --> 01:32:05.115]  America was in a coma.
[01:32:05.115 --> 01:32:09.579]  We were being absolutely poisoned physically, culturally, and spiritually.
[01:32:09.579 --> 01:32:14.543]  The New World Order was running rampant because the public was asleep.
[01:32:14.543 --> 01:32:23.409]  Fast forward to this year, in 2020, and to see Soros spend over $100 million on the Women's March here in D.C.
[01:32:23.409 --> 01:32:25.571]  and in Los Angeles, and they might have had 30,000 people.
[01:32:26.972 --> 01:32:28.133]  Maybe.
[01:32:28.133 --> 01:32:31.034]  They had five million three years ago, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:32:31.034 --> 01:32:32.015]  I was here.
[01:32:32.015 --> 01:32:40.960]  That is emblematic of how his money and Chai Com money cannot buy them the AstroTurf anymore.
[01:32:40.960 --> 01:32:43.821]  So yes, the awakenings happened, but we're not out of the woods.
[01:32:43.821 --> 01:32:51.305]  The globalists are going to throw a bunch of Hail Marys during this Trump Senate trial, and we're going to be covering it live from D.C.
[01:32:51.305 --> 01:32:52.726]  at Band.Video.
[01:32:52.726 --> 01:32:54.307]  Please be Paul Revere and share this link.
[01:33:00.330 --> 01:33:08.515]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:08.515 --> 01:33:09.635]  Big Brother.
[01:33:09.635 --> 01:33:11.436]  Mainstream media.
[01:33:11.436 --> 01:33:13.317]  Government cover-ups.
[01:33:13.317 --> 01:33:15.018]  You want to stop tyranny?
[01:33:15.018 --> 01:33:16.659]  Well, so does he.
[01:33:16.659 --> 01:33:21.362]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[01:34:07.540 --> 01:34:30.687]  You know, this happens here on air, and in the interest of total transparency, I was already going to play this later in the fourth hour, but I'm going to play it now, because it's so important, and we've got so many incredible clips from what happened in Virginia that during a short break, trying to decide again which ones we're going to play, because they're all so powerful,
[01:34:32.574 --> 01:34:34.418]  And then other people come in the room and ask questions.
[01:34:34.418 --> 01:34:35.240]  It's not a problem.
[01:34:35.240 --> 01:34:36.943]  We're just an open newsroom in here.
[01:34:36.943 --> 01:34:39.028]  You know, we're too few people doing too much.
[01:34:39.028 --> 01:34:40.531]  I'm not complaining.
[01:34:40.531 --> 01:34:41.172]  Then I get angry.
[01:34:42.352 --> 01:34:51.078]  And I've learned, instead of getting angry, just say, hey, I'm going to pick what I think is one of the most important reports and just play almost the whole thing.
[01:34:51.078 --> 01:34:52.599]  This is a ten and a half minute segment.
[01:34:52.599 --> 01:34:54.961]  We're already nine minutes into it.
[01:34:54.961 --> 01:34:58.764]  But the report is up on InfoWars.com and up on NewsWars.com.
[01:34:58.764 --> 01:35:02.146]  And it's really powerful and it's important.
[01:35:02.146 --> 01:35:05.509]  And the only way it gets out to new people is when you share it.
[01:35:06.169 --> 01:35:10.531]  And there's just so many hundreds of new videos a day at Bandot Video.
[01:35:10.531 --> 01:35:15.494]  It's just crazy how much InfoWars is putting out thanks to your support and your prayers.
[01:35:15.494 --> 01:35:22.498]  And there's a really powerful report, Black Guns Matter, that's again 10 minutes long, that Millie Weaver put out.
[01:35:23.743 --> 01:35:42.322]  Richmond narrative shattered, super powerful Kaitlin Bennett, and all these others that we filed and Owen filed and what I witnessed in the USA Chance and how it blew up in Northam's face, which I'll get to next segment, then I'll get into the latest virus news, then I'll get into the big news on what is in our water and Trump
[01:35:42.782 --> 01:35:51.627]  Countering Greta Thunberg and the reports up on Infowars.com and then we'll get to a lot of calls in the third into the fourth hour here today.
[01:35:51.627 --> 01:35:58.150]  But let's just go to this report because it's a form of frustration that's actually we ought to be glad about.
[01:35:58.150 --> 01:36:02.932]  Have so much powerful stuff that we're having heated debates about what to go to.
[01:36:02.932 --> 01:36:07.555]  So I just think we should go to a large portion of this
[01:36:08.840 --> 01:36:12.323]  Millie Weaver, report, Black Guns Matter.
[01:36:12.323 --> 01:36:13.584]  Here it is.
[01:36:13.584 --> 01:36:29.178]  The message that I'm here to spread is to let them know that I'm tired of the threats to our rights, taking our rights away, and making us pretty much criminals and felons overnight if these laws are to be passed.
[01:36:29.178 --> 01:36:30.139]  We're just sick and tired of it.
[01:36:30.139 --> 01:36:32.421]  I mean, as you can see, the numbers out here say a lot.
[01:36:37.526 --> 01:36:39.607]  We're here with Chuck Smith.
[01:36:39.607 --> 01:36:45.290]  You ran for Attorney General and now you're out here participating in this Second Amendment rally.
[01:36:45.290 --> 01:36:47.811]  Why is the Second Amendment so important to you?
[01:36:47.811 --> 01:36:49.972]  The Constitution is important.
[01:36:49.972 --> 01:36:52.613]  The Second Amendment is just one part of the Constitution.
[01:36:52.613 --> 01:36:56.695]  Listen, if they steamroll the Second Amendment, they'll steamroll everything else.
[01:36:56.695 --> 01:36:59.756]  People are concerned about their rights to bear arms.
[01:36:59.756 --> 01:37:00.877]  That's not a state right.
[01:37:00.877 --> 01:37:02.438]  That's a United States Constitution right.
[01:37:03.078 --> 01:37:11.981]  At the end of the day, we've got to get the government on board with the fact that they just can't suspend the Constitution or any part of it when they get ready.
[01:37:11.981 --> 01:37:20.644]  You've got people who are concerned, not just that the government has an ulterior motive, but the government doesn't appreciate the rights of the citizens.
[01:37:20.644 --> 01:37:28.126]  You know, the rights were given to each of the citizens of Virginia by the United States government.
[01:37:28.126 --> 01:37:30.747]  They weren't given by Virginia, so Virginia can't take it away.
[01:37:31.775 --> 01:37:35.238]  The governor has done something which I think is really unprecedented.
[01:37:35.238 --> 01:37:41.703]  Nowhere anywhere can you get a law or an order for a law based on your suspicion that something might happen.
[01:37:41.703 --> 01:37:57.215]  What do you think about how the media has been spinning this, that this is all a bunch of radical extremists out here today that, you know, have bad intentions or have racial intentions and that this is like a thing that everyone should be afraid of?
[01:37:57.215 --> 01:37:59.076]  Of course they would say that to help
[01:38:01.408 --> 01:38:04.529]  Have you seen any KKK or whatnot out here?
[01:38:04.529 --> 01:38:05.570]  Nope, haven't seen one.
[01:38:05.570 --> 01:38:08.151]  Matter of fact, John, come here.
[01:38:08.151 --> 01:38:09.992]  This is a sponsor to my podcast.
[01:38:09.992 --> 01:38:12.633]  Also director for Gun Owners of America for Virginia.
[01:38:12.633 --> 01:38:14.474]  If this is a white supremacist movement,
[01:38:30.561 --> 01:38:34.924]  Why would my sponsor, who is a white guy, sponsoring a black podcast be here?
[01:38:34.924 --> 01:38:37.106]  It just doesn't add up, right?
[01:38:37.106 --> 01:38:40.428]  But at the same time, pro-gunners have to be better with PR.
[01:38:40.428 --> 01:38:44.111]  We have to get better at showing the diversity in the Second Amendment community.
[01:38:44.111 --> 01:38:47.634]  So we're definitely here to show that there's unity because the media play and act like we don't.
[01:38:48.594 --> 01:38:49.955]  We don't deal with each other very well.
[01:38:49.955 --> 01:38:51.657]  We won't come together, but you can look around.
[01:38:51.657 --> 01:38:53.738]  I've seen people from all walks of life today.
[01:38:53.738 --> 01:38:56.981]  Different colors, different countries, different cities.
[01:38:56.981 --> 01:39:00.684]  So I'm just here to support that, but it's important to me because that's what I need to protect my life.
[01:39:00.684 --> 01:39:02.566]  And if you take that away from me, what am I going to do?
[01:39:03.669 --> 01:39:13.053]  There's enough of us that's willing to be here, and I heard a report that it's probably going to be close to 100,000 people throughout the entire day to show up here, to show their support for America.
[01:39:13.053 --> 01:39:14.294]  You know, this is beautiful.
[01:39:14.294 --> 01:39:15.594]  I love seeing this.
[01:39:15.594 --> 01:39:18.616]  Northam is trying to separate people.
[01:39:19.536 --> 01:39:20.577]  This is not a black issue.
[01:39:20.577 --> 01:39:21.617]  This is not a white issue.
[01:39:21.617 --> 01:39:23.297]  This is not Hispanic or Asian.
[01:39:23.297 --> 01:39:24.658]  This is an American issue.
[01:39:24.658 --> 01:39:28.319]  And at the end of the day, Martin Luther King stood for Americans.
[01:39:28.319 --> 01:39:34.581]  His pitch was, if there's discord anywhere, if there's injustice anywhere, there's injustice everywhere.
[01:39:34.581 --> 01:39:42.484]  You can't have something like this where Northam believes that something is about to happen and he is going to roll down the Second Amendment.
[01:39:43.044 --> 01:39:48.208]  You have families, fathers, mothers who believe not just in the Second Amendment, they believe in all of it.
[01:39:48.208 --> 01:39:52.391]  The First Amendment, the Fourth Amendment, the Fifth Amendment, all of it.
[01:39:52.391 --> 01:39:55.173]  The Tenth Amendment specifically says that government can't do this.
[01:39:55.173 --> 01:39:57.695]  There are certain things that belong to the people.
[01:39:57.695 --> 01:40:02.198]  Northam believes that he can suspend it, and these people are here to tell him he can't do that.
[01:40:02.198 --> 01:40:08.203]  What they say about us is completely a fallacy, it's not true.
[01:40:08.203 --> 01:40:09.304]  It's just a method of them to
[01:40:10.424 --> 01:40:19.067]  To kind of just brainwash the public that's not necessarily on board with us or just kind of neutral to kind of get them on their side.
[01:40:19.067 --> 01:40:26.570]  Well, you know, they had to ratify it a long time ago because of us in 66 when we were trying to protect ourselves a long time ago.
[01:40:26.570 --> 01:40:29.151]  So it's part of history for us.
[01:40:29.151 --> 01:40:30.272]  If you go back into history.
[01:40:30.812 --> 01:40:32.315]  Uh, gun control starts in Virginia.
[01:40:32.315 --> 01:40:35.138]  It's a very racist place, and this is where I was basically raised.
[01:40:35.138 --> 01:40:36.520]  This is where I'm from.
[01:40:36.520 --> 01:40:41.647]  Uh, so, I mean, if you're trying to take anything away from me that I need to protect myself, I think that's a no-go.
[01:40:41.647 --> 01:40:45.472]  Uh, and I also don't agree with some of the things going on with this, uh, black-faced Northam guy.
[01:40:46.133 --> 01:40:47.994]  The second amendment is black history.
[01:40:47.994 --> 01:41:00.040]  The first gun restrictions were in place right here in Virginia in the 1600s and after that we had slave codes right after the Civil War and then after that we had Jim Crow and then we had the Mulford Act.
[01:41:00.040 --> 01:41:06.003]  So literally this country has always been stripping away black people from being able to defend themselves and liberate themselves.
[01:41:06.003 --> 01:41:07.204]  So that's why it's important to me.
[01:41:07.204 --> 01:41:11.526]  I'm trying to carry on the ancestors or carry on the tradition that my ancestors did before me.
[01:41:11.946 --> 01:41:17.131]  What do you think about Governor Ralph Northam, how he had that controversy with blackface?
[01:41:17.131 --> 01:41:17.852]  We were here.
[01:41:17.852 --> 01:41:18.593]  We came here.
[01:41:18.593 --> 01:41:20.815]  Yeah, we came here to protest that too.
[01:41:20.815 --> 01:41:21.356]  Absolutely.
[01:41:21.356 --> 01:41:23.458]  We came here to protest that too.
[01:41:23.458 --> 01:41:24.379]  It's despicable.
[01:41:24.379 --> 01:41:32.647]  You know, I know he says it was a long time ago and it was Halloween costumes or whatever it was, but all in all, you know.
[01:41:33.499 --> 01:41:33.759]  We know.
[01:41:53.646 --> 01:41:59.369]  As far as history goes, he's also killing innocent babies that have already been born.
[01:41:59.369 --> 01:42:08.633]  So, if you're pro-abortion, which, you know, disproportionately affects black people, you're taking black people's guns, this looks like we're going back in time to me.
[01:42:08.633 --> 01:42:11.814]  So, yeah, I just, I don't think he should be in office at all.
[01:42:12.054 --> 01:42:17.297]  This is the governor now, who, with the Attorney General, was rolling around in blackface.
[01:42:17.297 --> 01:42:22.521]  This is the government where the Lieutenant Governor was rolling around in scandal.
[01:42:22.521 --> 01:42:27.084]  Whatever that case may, you know, whatever's happening there, there was a state of emergency, right?
[01:42:27.084 --> 01:42:28.645]  The government was in turmoil.
[01:42:28.645 --> 01:42:31.807]  We have to get back to issues that matter.
[01:42:31.807 --> 01:42:38.751]  What the people here are saying, when we're talking about our homes, our families, our children, we're also talking about our rights to defend ourselves.
[01:42:39.031 --> 01:42:41.615]  Well, it's a very powerful report.
[01:42:41.615 --> 01:42:42.976]  There's about three minutes left of it.
[01:42:42.976 --> 01:42:44.498]  It's at Band.Video.
[01:42:44.498 --> 01:42:45.019]  We come back.
[01:42:45.019 --> 01:42:49.265]  We're going to look at the ongoing actions of Northam because he just struck back.
[01:42:49.265 --> 01:42:50.587]  We'll break it down on the other side.
[01:42:50.587 --> 01:42:51.508]  Band.Video.
[01:42:51.508 --> 01:42:52.089]  Band.Video.
[01:42:57.387 --> 01:43:03.672]  We have a new product, and we got several thousand of these in, and they're gonna sell out in a few days at the rate we're selling them.
[01:43:03.672 --> 01:43:14.523]  I want to thank the listeners for getting it, but this really is a game-changing toothpaste, and it doesn't compete with Super Blue that's four to five a colloidal silver and iodine and fluoride-free.
[01:43:15.492 --> 01:43:17.234]  The adult or the children's.
[01:43:17.234 --> 01:43:20.797]  These are both excellent toothpaste concentrates that don't have fillers.
[01:43:20.797 --> 01:43:21.698]  People love it.
[01:43:21.698 --> 01:43:29.825]  This is a whitening toothpaste that also has the above sea coral calcium that also cleans but also re-mineralizes the teeth.
[01:43:30.566 --> 01:43:33.348]  Then it has the patented silver saw.
[01:43:33.348 --> 01:43:36.049]  Silver in it to knock out the bacteria that cause gingivitis.
[01:43:36.049 --> 01:43:36.870]  This is all proven.
[01:43:36.870 --> 01:43:38.431]  You can make claims with this.
[01:43:38.431 --> 01:43:49.597]  But I have to tell you, no one has a toothpaste this good for knocking out the bacteria, the viruses, and cleaning the teeth in a healthy way that doesn't strip away the enamel.
[01:43:49.597 --> 01:43:50.958]  So, we're really proud of it.
[01:43:50.958 --> 01:43:51.899]  It funds the operation.
[01:43:51.899 --> 01:43:52.959]  Infowarstore.com.
[01:43:52.959 --> 01:43:56.101]  And that's why we're still on air thanks to you!
[01:43:56.101 --> 01:43:58.282]  Hey, you there.
[01:43:58.282 --> 01:43:58.943]  We have a problem.
[01:44:00.011 --> 01:44:02.792]  You see, there is a baby.
[01:44:02.792 --> 01:44:06.693]  The mother of this baby is not sure she's ready.
[01:44:06.693 --> 01:44:10.794]  The father of this baby doesn't want to settle down.
[01:44:10.794 --> 01:44:13.594]  The mother starts to have regrets.
[01:44:13.594 --> 01:44:17.355]  The father considers leaving town.
[01:44:17.355 --> 01:44:20.696]  But a friend says there's a solution.
[01:44:20.696 --> 01:44:24.837]  She says to have an abortion.
[01:44:24.837 --> 01:44:26.737]  The mother decides to look into it.
[01:44:26.737 --> 01:44:28.778]  The clinic assures her it's safe.
[01:44:29.810 --> 01:44:31.591]  She's made her decision.
[01:44:31.591 --> 01:44:34.093]  She's going to have an abortion.
[01:44:34.093 --> 01:44:40.377]  The problem is, that baby is you.
[01:44:40.377 --> 01:44:49.403]  Join me, Owen Schroyer, at the March for Life, Friday, January 24th, in Washington, D.C., noon, at the National Mall.
[01:44:49.403 --> 01:44:50.544]  I'll see you there.
[01:44:50.544 --> 01:44:52.985]  It's time to stand up for the unborn.
[01:44:52.985 --> 01:44:54.987]  It's time to speak out for the voiceless.
[01:44:57.136 --> 01:45:00.738]  InfoWars Life is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine.
[01:45:00.738 --> 01:45:02.519]  Introducing Pollen Block.
[01:45:02.519 --> 01:45:13.785]  We have found an extraordinary new, natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms, including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort, and respiratory function.
[01:45:14.565 --> 01:45:23.747]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs experienced less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses.
[01:45:23.747 --> 01:45:34.270]  They began studying this effect in published trials, and decades later, we now have the fruit of this research, a fast-acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms.
[01:45:34.790 --> 01:45:37.413]  Pollen Block is natural and effective.
[01:45:37.413 --> 01:45:39.135]  It is not an antihistamine.
[01:45:39.135 --> 01:45:49.146]  In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of tryptase, which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.
[01:45:49.146 --> 01:45:51.789]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe.
[01:45:51.789 --> 01:45:56.494]  Head to Infowarslife.com and grab a pack of our Pollen Block chewable tablets.
[01:45:57.682 --> 01:46:01.343]  It's time to take a new, healthier approach to one of your most basic needs.

[01:46:52.330 --> 01:46:54.231]  Remember, we're all part of the fight.
[01:46:54.231 --> 01:46:56.552]  InfoWars, brought to you by you.
[01:46:59.787 --> 01:47:25.736]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:25.736 --> 01:47:26.896]  Well, it's now official.
[01:47:27.816 --> 01:47:35.220]  The French government admits there are hundreds and hundreds of no-go zones in which French cannot go.
[01:47:35.220 --> 01:47:37.601]  You can be black, you can be white, you can be old, you can be young.
[01:47:37.601 --> 01:47:41.063]  If you're not a Muslim, you're going to get your ass attacked.
[01:47:41.063 --> 01:47:50.888]  And if you're an American rapper and you fight back in France or Sweden, they're going to lock your ass up until President Trump gets you out of jail.
[01:47:50.888 --> 01:47:56.091]  Imagine a bunch of big black dudes are walking down the street and a bunch of little Islamics come up and literally start attacking them.
[01:47:57.970 --> 01:48:01.893]  Black guys fight back, they're Americans, and they go to jail.
[01:48:01.893 --> 01:48:04.955]  That's how Europe has rolled out the red carpet to the Islamists.
[01:48:04.955 --> 01:48:07.037]  And I have a big stack of news on that front.
[01:48:07.037 --> 01:48:08.618]  It's crazy.
[01:48:08.618 --> 01:48:13.181]  More throwing old people out of their houses to give it to Muslims.
[01:48:13.181 --> 01:48:19.406]  I was against the wars to stir up the Muslims and invade the Middle East.
[01:48:19.406 --> 01:48:21.828]  But then I saw the later part of the plan flooding Europe.
[01:48:24.068 --> 01:48:31.429]  Once they had taught the Muslims to hate us even more, and making Europe bow down and submit to Islam, it's a master plan.
[01:48:31.429 --> 01:48:32.350]  And it's admitted, the U.N.
[01:48:32.350 --> 01:48:34.450]  has an admitted plan.
[01:48:34.450 --> 01:48:39.051]  And this is how modern warfare is fought.
[01:48:39.051 --> 01:48:50.513]  And I had Muslims repeatedly come up and tell me, when I was in D.C., listen, we're gonna conquer you just like we've conquered Paris.
[01:48:54.861 --> 01:49:00.484]  And you're going to submit or you're going to be driven into the hills.
[01:49:00.484 --> 01:49:10.349]  And I'm going to get to this later, but it's a long story.
[01:49:10.349 --> 01:49:15.812]  But I had a group of Muslims covertly messing with my wife when I took her on the trip with me.
[01:49:15.812 --> 01:49:17.753]  So they didn't mess with me.
[01:49:17.753 --> 01:49:18.973]  They would mess with her.
[01:49:18.973 --> 01:49:22.075]  And I didn't think she was crazy, but I was like, really?
[01:49:22.075 --> 01:49:24.336]  And then I caught one of them doing it in the hotel.
[01:49:26.601 --> 01:49:29.982]  Coming up saying mean things, not acting like nothing happened, gaslighting.
[01:49:29.982 --> 01:49:32.963]  It's just incredible because they know how to not go frontal up against the man.
[01:49:32.963 --> 01:49:34.804]  They mess with your woman.
[01:49:34.804 --> 01:49:38.365]  It's just, it's just, it's disgusting is what it is.
[01:49:38.365 --> 01:49:40.886]  And I'm not going to live under that type of crap, I can just tell you.
[01:49:40.886 --> 01:49:43.226]  Are there good people in those countries?
[01:49:43.226 --> 01:49:43.667]  Yes.
[01:49:43.667 --> 01:49:44.667]  Do I want to kill them all?
[01:49:44.667 --> 01:49:45.327]  No.
[01:49:45.327 --> 01:49:46.668]  Will I submit to them?
[01:49:46.668 --> 01:49:48.488]  Absolutely not.
[01:49:48.488 --> 01:49:50.489]  Islam means submission and it ain't happening.
[01:49:51.434 --> 01:49:51.834]  You got it?
[01:49:51.834 --> 01:49:57.696]  The only person I'm getting on my knees to is Jesus Christ, and that's because he's the Son of God.
[01:49:57.696 --> 01:50:01.036]  I'll submit to Christ all day long, I'm not submitting to you over my dead body.
[01:50:01.036 --> 01:50:03.497]  And I'm sure you'll try to arrange it.
[01:50:03.497 --> 01:50:09.998]  But not before I've rallied the people.
[01:50:09.998 --> 01:50:14.660]  There are a lot of people in those countries that want to live in freedom.
[01:50:14.660 --> 01:50:15.960]  And Islam needs a reformation.
[01:50:19.039 --> 01:50:23.260]  Because what it really is, is a criminal political system.
[01:50:23.260 --> 01:50:25.661]  What we need is real Christianity.
[01:50:25.661 --> 01:50:27.622]  That is the answer to unify humanity together.
[01:50:27.622 --> 01:50:31.903]  And Christianity is tolerant of other groups.
[01:50:31.903 --> 01:50:33.843]  Islam is not.
[01:50:33.843 --> 01:50:37.465]  But by making it the world religion, everyone then must submit to it.
[01:50:37.465 --> 01:50:38.705]  And that's what the globalists have chosen.
[01:50:40.623 --> 01:50:57.929]  And the Antichrist is going to try to enforce in the future a weird, globalist, secularist system, but that is allied with Islam, where it will be able to persecute whoever it wants, and that you'll have to bow to it and to the beast at the same time.
[01:50:57.929 --> 01:51:01.430]  Because everything with Satan is a fraud and a contradiction.
[01:51:01.430 --> 01:51:07.752]  You can see the whole thing coming clearly, clearly into view.
[01:51:07.752 --> 01:51:09.073]  And the beast at the whore rides.
[01:51:10.222 --> 01:51:14.124]  That's why the Vatican is now converting to Islam in the final move.
[01:51:14.124 --> 01:51:16.245]  And Catholics are rejecting it.
[01:51:16.245 --> 01:51:19.826]  Because it's no longer Catholicism that is in Rome.
[01:51:19.826 --> 01:51:23.368]  It is 100% a satanic religion.
[01:51:23.368 --> 01:51:27.330]  Captured by the devil himself.
[01:51:27.330 --> 01:51:29.010]  God help us.
[01:51:29.010 --> 01:51:32.792]  God help us.
[01:51:32.792 --> 01:51:35.413]  The Pope says, open the gates of Europe, flood everything.
[01:51:35.413 --> 01:51:38.114]  He says he becomes nauseous last year.
[01:51:38.114 --> 01:51:39.635]  He goes, I become sick.
[01:51:42.264 --> 01:51:48.888]  To my stomach when I hear about Europe's Christian roots and how we should keep Europe Christian.
[01:51:48.888 --> 01:51:50.829]  The supposed head of Christendom!
[01:51:50.829 --> 01:51:54.191]  The defender of the faith!
[01:51:54.191 --> 01:51:59.254]  You say what you want about Popes having problems in the past, but they sent millions to war.
[01:51:59.254 --> 01:52:02.676]  And so did the Orthodox Church to stop Europe from being overrun by Islam.
[01:52:02.676 --> 01:52:06.298]  And now he says, bring them in and I don't want to hear about Christianity!
[01:52:09.224 --> 01:52:11.205]  Big fat devil, that's all I see.
[01:52:11.205 --> 01:52:13.345]  Big ol' pedo manager.
[01:52:13.345 --> 01:52:19.107]  I don't know if he has sex with kids, but I sure as hell know he protects it.
[01:52:19.107 --> 01:52:20.267]  Got a big problem.
[01:52:20.267 --> 01:52:24.629]  Okay, I said I'd get to all this other news and I haven't.
[01:52:24.629 --> 01:52:27.370]  I'm just angry right now.
[01:52:27.370 --> 01:52:30.771]  Absolutely angry.
[01:52:30.771 --> 01:52:31.851]  And there's just too many angles.
[01:52:31.851 --> 01:52:32.651]  There's just too much news.
[01:52:32.651 --> 01:52:33.731]  There's just too much to cover.
[01:52:33.731 --> 01:52:35.172]  I don't even know how you hit it all.
[01:52:36.411 --> 01:52:37.472]  But let me just let me do this.
[01:52:37.472 --> 01:52:42.736]  Let me just finish up with the gun stuff and I'll get to everything else.
[01:52:42.736 --> 01:52:49.081]  The Virginia governor said there was going to be a big civil war and death and all this crap.
[01:52:49.081 --> 01:52:51.743]  We said they were going to say that before he said it.
[01:52:51.743 --> 01:52:55.566]  And they were planning something bigger than Dallas.
[01:52:55.566 --> 01:52:58.528]  A city in Northeast Texas.
[01:52:58.528 --> 01:53:01.230]  But instead it was I estimated 30,000.
[01:53:01.230 --> 01:53:04.352]  But then the police said tens of thousands came and go.
[01:53:04.352 --> 01:53:05.233]  It might have been as much as 60,000.
[01:53:07.486 --> 01:53:10.427]  But you notice I estimated 30,000 at about 11 a.m.
[01:53:10.427 --> 01:53:13.407]  The police later said they estimated 30,000 as well.
[01:53:13.407 --> 01:53:16.008]  Just saying, InfoWars, excuse me for exaggerating.
[01:53:16.008 --> 01:53:21.029]  No, I really go with what I think is accurate, and most of the time it's right.
[01:53:21.029 --> 01:53:32.111]  Virginia's massive pro-gun rally draws big crowds, big weapons, and Alex Jones in a big armored vehicle.
[01:53:32.111 --> 01:53:33.872]  Continuing.
[01:53:33.872 --> 01:53:35.312]  Incredibly, no one got shot.
[01:53:37.554 --> 01:53:39.256]  No one shot themselves at Virginia Rally.
[01:53:39.256 --> 01:53:41.819]  Vice.
[01:53:41.819 --> 01:53:44.542]  Our malicious activist Alex Jones converge on Richmond.
[01:53:44.542 --> 01:53:47.466]  Pro-Gun Rally.
[01:53:47.466 --> 01:53:49.328]  Alex Jones cruises the streets in Battle Tank.
[01:53:52.014 --> 01:53:54.336]  Now, what's going on with that?
[01:53:54.336 --> 01:53:57.558]  Well, this is the new article, nationalfile.com.
[01:53:57.558 --> 01:54:04.303]  Virginia Senate Democrats ignore massive gun rights rally, advance red flag legislation.
[01:54:04.303 --> 01:54:07.466]  It goes through that it's passed through the committees.
[01:54:07.466 --> 01:54:15.392]  They have the votes to preemptively, without due process, with no evidence or planning anything, take your guns and kill you if you resist.
[01:54:15.392 --> 01:54:18.014]  And they've got laws almost passed to take all semi-autos.
[01:54:18.014 --> 01:54:19.275]  I've already read the laws on here.
[01:54:21.016 --> 01:54:23.899]  Notice Northam was just saying two weeks ago, oh, they're not going to pass.
[01:54:23.899 --> 01:54:25.781]  Don't worry, we just want better background checks.
[01:54:25.781 --> 01:54:27.642]  And of course now they're passing through.
[01:54:27.642 --> 01:54:33.088]  So they always tell you it's not happening, so you don't resist politically so it goes through.
[01:54:33.088 --> 01:54:36.591]  Oh, nobody wants your guns.
[01:54:36.591 --> 01:54:40.515]  And again, 80% of the Capitol grounds were cut off.
[01:54:41.420 --> 01:54:48.281]  So that they could sandwich everyone in, at least 20,000 that got in, and I got out of there.
[01:54:48.281 --> 01:54:53.102]  I had my crew there, my security, and I said, the way this is filling up, we're already shoulder to shoulder.
[01:54:53.102 --> 01:54:55.383]  I said, another 30 minutes, this is going to be dangerous.
[01:54:55.383 --> 01:54:58.543]  And I said, if they stage some stampede, I don't want to be here.
[01:54:58.543 --> 01:55:08.726]  So we got outside of the containment area, and it was just every street and every angle was just tens of thousands of people, and 5,000 down this street, 10,000 down that street, thousands down this street, thousands everywhere.
[01:55:08.726 --> 01:55:09.826]  I mean, it was 50,000 people at one point.
[01:55:12.196 --> 01:55:17.504]  And that's with them blocking all the parking garages and everything so people couldn't get there.
[01:55:17.504 --> 01:55:18.726]  Talk about a time bomb.
[01:55:18.726 --> 01:55:27.940]  If anybody would have fallen down, or there had been a backfire of a car, or anything, but it didn't happen, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:55:29.577 --> 01:55:30.197]  It didn't happen.
[01:55:59.657 --> 01:56:00.958]  Massive election fraud.
[01:56:00.958 --> 01:56:05.322]  And so let's pray for Virginia because what's happened to Virginia has happened to Texas.
[01:56:05.322 --> 01:56:07.264]  We're inches away from where they're at.
[01:56:07.264 --> 01:56:08.905]  We're very close to where California is.
[01:56:08.905 --> 01:56:10.847]  And everybody thinks, oh, Virginia is safe.
[01:56:10.847 --> 01:56:12.308]  Oh, Texas is safe.
[01:56:12.308 --> 01:56:14.090]  No, it's not.
[01:56:14.090 --> 01:56:23.438]  Just because you've had freedom because your great, great, great, great granddaddy fought for it doesn't mean it's still going to be there because they're flooding the states with illegal aliens that are voting.
[01:56:23.438 --> 01:56:25.420]  And again, I don't hate the illegal aliens.
[01:56:26.914 --> 01:56:33.621]  In fact, we always can use more workers and more brains, as long as they weren't brainwashed to vote against the Second Amendment and vote Democrat.
[01:56:33.621 --> 01:56:37.845]  Because they are, and they're voting illegally, they gotta be kept from getting in!
[01:56:37.845 --> 01:56:39.987]  Because they're being used as a weapon!
[01:56:39.987 --> 01:56:42.069]  And I'm not gonna sit here and take it!
[01:56:42.069 --> 01:56:44.211]  So you come here illegally, and you're producing?
[01:56:44.211 --> 01:56:45.973]  We need to compete with China and India.
[01:56:45.973 --> 01:56:47.454]  If you adopt our values, great.
[01:56:48.220 --> 01:56:52.362]  But they're not adopting our values because the Democrats have it set up to put them on welfare and brainwash them.
[01:56:52.362 --> 01:56:56.004]  So until that's fixed, I want a moratorium on immigration, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:56:56.004 --> 01:56:58.405]  A moratorium until it's fixed.
[01:56:58.405 --> 01:56:59.666]  Alright, I'm gonna go to break.
[01:57:00.865 --> 01:57:02.686]  Didn't plug once this hour.
[01:57:02.686 --> 01:57:04.368]  We're not bringing in really any money right now.
[01:57:04.368 --> 01:57:06.269]  We've got two big sales running.
[01:57:06.269 --> 01:57:08.331]  I really need you to support us and get products you already need.
[01:57:08.331 --> 01:57:10.032]  It's a total win-win, so just take action.
[01:57:10.032 --> 01:57:13.916]  You see them forwards busting our butts, and we'll do such a better job to keep us in the game.
[01:57:13.916 --> 01:57:19.380]  Fish and oil sales about to end, Ultimate Fish and Oil, because we'll run out in about two weeks if I don't take it off sale in about a week.
[01:57:19.380 --> 01:57:20.101]  Take advantage of that.
[01:57:20.101 --> 01:57:20.541]  It's amazing.
[01:57:20.541 --> 01:57:21.802]  Don't have time to get into the benefits of it.
[01:57:21.802 --> 01:57:23.283]  We've got the best out there.
[01:57:23.283 --> 01:57:26.446]  There might be something as good, but from our research, it's really good.
[01:57:27.046 --> 01:57:29.747]  I've got to really hand it to the listeners and viewers of InfoWars.
[01:57:49.966 --> 01:58:00.350]  Your support and your help in rebooting Americana as a challenge to the globalist system of corporate tyranny has really caught hold, not just here in the U.S., but worldwide.
[01:58:00.350 --> 01:58:07.093]  And President Trump's fearlessness when it comes to promoting Americana and basic liberty is amazing as well.
[01:58:07.873 --> 01:58:17.627]  He's still lacking on the big tech censorship, taking action against that and some other areas, but trying to end the wars, boosting our economy, speaking out against communist China.
[01:58:17.627 --> 01:58:20.330]  Trump's been doing an amazing job, but now more than ever.
[01:58:21.172 --> 01:58:26.334]  We really have to realize that we're being targeted because we are effective.
[01:58:26.334 --> 01:58:31.296]  And the globalists are beginning to lose their war against humanity in a big way.
[01:58:31.296 --> 01:58:33.677]  And so we're going to see some major fireworks out of them.
[01:58:33.677 --> 01:58:39.439]  But it's critical to not let ourselves get down when we see all the poison they spray at us.
[01:58:39.439 --> 01:58:41.440]  That's an attempt to demoralize us.
[01:58:41.440 --> 01:58:44.541]  We've got to remember that and stay focused and stay happy.
[01:58:47.751 --> 01:58:52.453]  You deserve a deep restful sleep with Knockout by InfoWars Life.

[01:59:43.126 --> 01:59:49.852]  That's InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:59:49.852 --> 01:59:52.475]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:02.211 --> 02:00:11.059]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[02:00:11.059 --> 02:00:17.545]  Alright, I said I was going to take calls today, but I've got my eye on the news here.
[02:00:17.545 --> 02:00:19.807]  Because there's a lot of breaking news, and there's also...
[02:00:21.567 --> 02:00:23.648]  Trump and Greta Thunberg is very illustrative.
[02:00:23.648 --> 02:00:26.850]  There's also the latest on the virus.
[02:00:26.850 --> 02:00:27.610]  They're hyping up.
[02:00:27.610 --> 02:00:29.611]  Is it really this mega deadly threat?
[02:00:29.611 --> 02:00:31.372]  I think it is a pretty big threat.
[02:00:31.372 --> 02:00:36.494]  There's a lot of creepy stuff going on in the background with that.
[02:00:36.494 --> 02:00:37.515]  Also, I mentioned this.
[02:00:37.515 --> 02:00:42.977]  French Intel Agency says 150 neighborhoods held by radical Islamists.
[02:00:42.977 --> 02:00:44.778]  Close quote.
[02:00:44.778 --> 02:00:45.639]  That's all coming up.
[02:00:45.639 --> 02:00:48.380]  And then there's really a big story.
[02:00:49.864 --> 02:00:53.425]  That was aired on Tucker Carlson last Friday.
[02:00:53.425 --> 02:00:57.927]  But because I was in D.C., I didn't cover it.
[02:00:57.927 --> 02:01:06.109]  And so I think I'm going to cover that after I cover the Greta Thunberg Trump news in the next segment.
[02:01:06.109 --> 02:01:08.830]  Because it's going to take at least a segment to get into.
[02:01:08.830 --> 02:01:10.971]  It's a really big deal.
[02:01:10.971 --> 02:01:16.232]  Because if you want to take Trump to the woodshed on something, that's it.
[02:01:16.232 --> 02:01:18.573]  See, I don't want to take Trump to the woodshed
[02:01:20.353 --> 02:01:20.513]  I don't
[02:01:43.919 --> 02:01:45.599]  I'm gonna get to it.
[02:01:45.599 --> 02:01:48.620]  Because everybody was running up to me in D.C.
[02:01:48.620 --> 02:01:51.621]  and then when I was in Virginia saying, oh, the gay frogs!
[02:01:51.621 --> 02:01:53.981]  Tucker Carlson says you're right about gay frogs!
[02:01:53.981 --> 02:02:06.084]  And I'm just like, guys, the genius of the globalists is they're able to take something very deadly serious and turn it into a joke.
[02:02:06.084 --> 02:02:10.725]  People say, yeah, and you're the one that went along with it.
[02:02:10.725 --> 02:02:12.306]  Well, that was like 10 years ago.
[02:02:12.306 --> 02:02:12.986]  I've learned a lot.
[02:02:15.129 --> 02:02:30.781]  I mean, I wasn't making a joke when I said I don't like them putting chemicals in the water that turned the frogs gay, but I laughed at it for a while until I realized, wait, they're getting us all to laugh at something that's destroying the earth and hurting us really, really bad.
[02:02:30.781 --> 02:02:35.345]  So that's why I joke around a lot less here on air.
[02:02:35.345 --> 02:02:41.930]  And I'm not as happy a person because I like to have fun.
[02:02:41.930 --> 02:02:43.571]  But, you know, there's no perfect way to stop this.
[02:02:43.571 --> 02:02:44.572]  We just got to take action.
[02:02:45.879 --> 02:02:51.904]  But there's a lot of chemicals that can be used in industry that aren't even the same class as bad as atrazine.
[02:02:51.904 --> 02:03:04.674]  And the fact that Trump has loosened up restrictions on atrazine when they've been cracked down on, he just saw everything the Democrats were restricting.
[02:03:06.223 --> 02:03:10.065]  That's something to shut down America, like clean burning coal and so many other things.
[02:03:10.065 --> 02:03:11.266]  And that's true.
[02:03:11.266 --> 02:03:13.187]  But Atrazine is not one of them.
[02:03:13.187 --> 02:03:18.630]  We need a global convention on things like Atrazine.
[02:03:18.630 --> 02:03:29.736]  Because the smallest amount of Atrazine will absolutely ruin your or your children's lives.
[02:03:29.736 --> 02:03:32.297]  And I'm not going to go into all the side effects and stuff today, but
[02:03:34.465 --> 02:03:36.927]  People seem to care about vain things.
[02:03:36.927 --> 02:03:39.028]  It doesn't matter if you're black, Hispanic, white, or old.
[02:03:39.028 --> 02:03:42.350]  In the last 70 years or so, that was in the water.
[02:03:42.350 --> 02:03:55.980]  The genitals, this is a uterine, the deformity happens in uterus during development of the fetus, where males slowly are having their genitals waste away until soon
[02:03:58.112 --> 02:04:03.797]  Men are going to have genitals the size of a woman's clitoris in about two generations with current atrazine levels.
[02:04:03.797 --> 02:04:08.781]  So, if you like your son's not having a cock, then you're going to love atrazine.
[02:04:08.781 --> 02:04:14.527]  So, you notice the globalists are obsessed with chopping your son's huevos off or getting him to sign on to doing it.
[02:04:14.527 --> 02:04:16.809]  And again, we can joke about it all day long, and I have.
[02:04:16.809 --> 02:04:19.171]  It's not funny.
[02:04:19.171 --> 02:04:24.876]  It's a vicious matter of the globalists hitting us chemically to attack and take out the species.
[02:04:26.673 --> 02:04:28.213]  So, that's what this is.
[02:04:28.213 --> 02:04:32.154]  And look, shrivels up men's genitals, screws them up for life.
[02:04:32.154 --> 02:04:33.855]  What's it do to women?
[02:04:33.855 --> 02:04:41.877]  Well, it's breast cancer and a whole bunch of other stuff and fries the uterus in utero where these girls are going to be sterile and screwed up for life.
[02:04:41.877 --> 02:04:43.578]  I mean, this is a weapon.
[02:04:43.578 --> 02:04:47.079]  Atrazine is a chemical weapon.
[02:04:47.079 --> 02:04:48.979]  Chemical weapon.
[02:04:48.979 --> 02:04:50.179]  Full reports at van.video.
[02:04:50.179 --> 02:04:52.240]  The only way it gets out is you.
[02:04:54.969 --> 02:05:05.055]  It is I, the leader of Cobra, here for a message to President Trump, the American people, and Alex Jones of InfoWars.
[02:05:05.055 --> 02:05:11.039]  Our operations with our partners, the Communist Chinese, have bought control of your media.
[02:05:11.039 --> 02:05:15.382]  But, it's true, your people are beginning to awaken.
[02:05:16.042 --> 02:05:27.556]  That's why Cobra is launching operations to trigger race war, mass shootings and bombings, which will be blamed on those loyal to America.
[02:05:27.556 --> 02:05:33.643]  Anyone, once we stage these attacks, that does not blame it on Trump will also be targeted by
[02:05:41.146 --> 02:05:52.721]  I will carry out attacks, and then blame you, like we've done with Alex Jones, blaming him for mass shootings we committed!
[02:05:52.721 --> 02:05:53.282]  Ha ha!
[02:05:53.282 --> 02:05:53.722]  Hail Cobra!
[02:06:06.434 --> 02:06:11.361]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones.
[02:06:25.765 --> 02:06:28.986]  For only the third time in history, a U.S.
[02:06:28.986 --> 02:06:31.187]  president is on trial.
[02:06:31.187 --> 02:06:38.470]  It officially kicked off just a few hours ago after days of wrangling by the Deep State Democrats as they attempted to see the American people.
[02:06:38.470 --> 02:06:45.293]  And now, we're going to be treated to two days of Adam Schiff lying his ass off.
[02:06:45.293 --> 02:06:49.995]  Every time we just tune in for 20 seconds, it's a new whopper lie with no evidence.
[02:06:51.289 --> 02:06:59.893]  On par with saying prostitutes were in a Russian hotel pissing all over then billionaire businessman Donald Trump.
[02:06:59.893 --> 02:07:06.157]  I mean, it's just flagrant horseman-er.
[02:07:06.157 --> 02:07:12.720]  And it's the death throes of that political party if they're unable to trigger a civil race war in this country.
[02:07:12.720 --> 02:07:13.981]  He's up there still right now.
[02:07:13.981 --> 02:07:17.242]  Here, let's fade him up and see what he's saying now.
[02:07:17.242 --> 02:07:18.323]  Keeping accountability.
[02:07:20.097 --> 02:07:23.178]  For the very next day, he's on the phone.
[02:07:23.178 --> 02:07:33.920]  The 24th, Special Counsel Mueller testifies that Russia interfered in our 2016 election to assist the Trump campaign.
[02:07:33.920 --> 02:07:36.921]  She knew about the interference, welcomed it, and utilized it.
[02:07:36.921 --> 02:07:38.661]  That's the 24th.
[02:07:38.661 --> 02:07:42.022]  The 25th is the day of the call.
[02:07:42.022 --> 02:07:44.563]  When President Trump, believing he'd escaped accountability,
[02:07:46.049 --> 02:07:46.750]  I can't believe this.
[02:07:46.750 --> 02:07:47.030]  Turn it off.
[02:07:47.030 --> 02:07:47.330]  Oh my gosh.
[02:08:07.466 --> 02:08:10.048]  So, no one's going to watch this, obviously.
[02:08:10.048 --> 02:08:18.355]  And the media that carries it is going to drive their ratings down from super low to absolute rock bottom.
[02:08:18.355 --> 02:08:33.267]  And then I guess they're betting it'll be so boring that by the time the Republicans finally get a defense, didn't get one in the House, haven't got one in the last couple months in the ongoing wrangling, we'll finally get a defense for two days.
[02:08:35.569 --> 02:08:38.110]  So this got started later today.
[02:08:38.110 --> 02:08:39.270]  That's only partial day.
[02:08:39.270 --> 02:08:51.374]  So I guess they're going to go until sometime early Friday.
[02:08:51.374 --> 02:08:58.576]  And then the Republicans, I guess, will start their defense Friday and then have it on Monday and part of Tuesday.
[02:08:58.576 --> 02:09:01.877]  Then the Senate will start asking questions a few days and deliberate.
[02:09:01.877 --> 02:09:02.757]  Looks like next Friday.
[02:09:03.928 --> 02:09:05.129]  And guess what Pelosi says?
[02:09:05.129 --> 02:09:12.232]  They've got more articles they're going to pass.
[02:09:12.232 --> 02:09:16.214]  And just keep doing it!
[02:09:16.214 --> 02:09:20.036]  Where it's just this ongoing process to sabotage the operation of the government.
[02:09:23.959 --> 02:09:29.361]  And the Communist Chinese are all openly funding Hollywood and the whole thing.
[02:09:29.361 --> 02:09:30.322]  And I want to explain something.
[02:09:30.322 --> 02:09:35.844]  The Globalists went and set up China so they can launder money and not have any environmental rules and shut us down.
[02:09:35.844 --> 02:09:36.645]  I mean, we know that.
[02:09:36.645 --> 02:09:51.051]  So when I say the Chai-coms, the Globalist-Chai-com disgusting partnership, and of course the Chai-coms in the middle of Obama administration had such disrespect for the Deep State that they double-crossed Obama and Hillary in the New World Order.
[02:09:52.537 --> 02:10:05.081]  So we had to pivot from feeding our troops and money into that desert in the Middle East and Central Asia to run over and try to get the Chai Koms back in line.
[02:10:05.081 --> 02:10:11.743]  And that's when the wheels started coming off on the Islamic invasion and the takedown and all of it.
[02:10:11.743 --> 02:10:21.447]  And even big central elites and institutional organizations said, look, we went along with this world government project to stop war, we were told, in the 50s.
[02:10:23.010 --> 02:10:38.702]  All this is doing is obsessing over chopping our son's testicles off and teaching people how to devil worship and how to get rid of a world of men and women and a post-human, post-industrial world with the big tech people ruling over us in AI.
[02:10:38.702 --> 02:10:43.846]  That doesn't sound like a good future, does it?
[02:10:43.846 --> 02:10:44.827]  Oh, but you'll live forever.
[02:10:44.827 --> 02:10:48.910]  You just gotta give up your humanity to the big tech system.
[02:10:48.910 --> 02:10:51.693]  And so a lot of the globalists are like, we don't want to be globalists anymore.
[02:10:52.944 --> 02:10:55.665]  You ever come up with that life extension stuff you tell me about it?
[02:10:55.665 --> 02:11:01.666]  Sounds like a bunch of hocus pocus to me.
[02:11:01.666 --> 02:11:08.348]  Why should we just throw the whole American world system, human system down the toilet?
[02:11:08.348 --> 02:11:11.408]  And purposely dumb everybody down so we can roll over them.
[02:11:11.408 --> 02:11:14.489]  That doesn't sound like something very powerful elites would do, does it?
[02:11:15.452 --> 02:11:33.817]  I mean, if I was a big, powerful elitist, and that I was elite mentally, physically, spiritually, culturally, and I'd proven it, and I was in control, I wouldn't be trying to run people down and make them dumb so I could rule over them, because I wouldn't need to!
[02:11:33.817 --> 02:11:35.558]  I'd want to empower them.
[02:11:35.558 --> 02:11:41.179]  Because I'd want my children, and their children, and their children, to grow up in a universe with better people.
[02:11:41.179 --> 02:11:44.020]  Because I metaphysically know that if I wiped out most of these people,
[02:11:45.333 --> 02:11:56.507]  That would all come back on my family, and it would come back on me, and I would never be allowed to cross the threshold into the next level and actually meet the Creator face-to-face.
[02:11:56.507 --> 02:11:59.230]  These people have thrown it all away, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:11:59.230 --> 02:12:00.692]  So I said I'd get to the news.
[02:12:00.692 --> 02:12:02.554]  When we come back, I'll be very judicious and very focused.
[02:12:03.732 --> 02:12:14.476]  I'm gonna hit the big water story with Tucker Carlson first, then I will hit Greta Thunberg and Trump countering that, and then I'll hit the Islamic invasion, big developments on that front.
[02:12:14.476 --> 02:12:21.778]  And then there's a bunch of other news here where Tulsi Gabbards has sued Hillary for defamation.
[02:12:21.778 --> 02:12:25.379]  Yeah, saying she's a Russian agent, trying to destroy her life.
[02:12:25.379 --> 02:12:28.701]  I have experienced this, and I'm not saying that as a victim, like, oh poor me.
[02:12:28.701 --> 02:12:29.501]  I just want action.
[02:12:30.609 --> 02:12:42.015]  Because you've all seen, and I haven't played half of them, the congressional hearings in the House Armed Services Committee, doesn't get any more powerful, in the Senate Intelligence Committee, saying I work for the damn Russians.
[02:12:46.351 --> 02:12:52.054]  So it's very personal for me that Trump be vindicated and that we be vindicated.
[02:12:52.054 --> 02:12:56.055]  Because I'm not going to get my day in court, but I've got this platform to defend myself.
[02:12:56.055 --> 02:12:59.537]  Because if they can take us down, they're going to slander all Americans.
[02:12:59.537 --> 02:13:01.038]  And that's really what I care about.
[02:13:01.038 --> 02:13:03.239]  I want to win because they want to beat you.
[02:13:04.059 --> 02:13:08.981]  They want to make you dumb and stupid and a slave, and that pisses me off!
[02:13:08.981 --> 02:13:19.224]  Watching these bullies, generation after generation, mutate humanity and enslave us so they can feel powerful, and it makes me so angry.
[02:13:19.224 --> 02:13:24.526]  And I want to get them off our backs.
[02:13:24.526 --> 02:13:27.627]  I want to get them off our backs so bad, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:13:27.627 --> 02:13:29.308]  And I'm rooting for humanity, but the only way
[02:13:31.107 --> 02:13:35.328]  We can defeat them is if we release what they fear.
[02:13:35.328 --> 02:13:37.289]  And they fear InfoWars.
[02:13:37.289 --> 02:13:44.550]  You know, I wasn't going to talk about this, but I might as well, because really it's a message to the White House.
[02:13:44.550 --> 02:13:48.511]  You know, I've had the White House reach out through a lot of people last week and this week.
[02:13:48.511 --> 02:13:51.052]  They can see how hard InfoWars is fighting.
[02:13:51.052 --> 02:13:59.654]  And because all the phones are tapped and all the rest of it, and when they open up the criminal investigation of myself and Stone, I've been under criminal investigation as a Russian as well.
[02:14:00.796 --> 02:14:03.498]  A lot of stuff I can't talk about at this point, but I've talked to the FBI.
[02:14:03.498 --> 02:14:04.780]  I've been in to see the FBI.
[02:14:04.780 --> 02:14:07.022]  A lot of stuff's going on, okay?
[02:14:07.022 --> 02:14:10.365]  And they obviously know I'm not a Russian and they understand what's happening.
[02:14:10.365 --> 02:14:10.545]  But...
[02:14:14.366 --> 02:14:16.827]  I don't want, I don't need Trump to call me.
[02:14:16.827 --> 02:14:23.428]  I don't need Trump to have other journalists contact me and say the President wanted to thank you and really appreciate you and appreciate what you're doing.
[02:14:23.428 --> 02:14:26.769]  I don't need to be patted on the head like I've told Trump when he calls me.
[02:14:26.769 --> 02:14:28.830]  I need action from the President.
[02:14:28.830 --> 02:14:34.331]  We've already seen bold action, but we need to get on the offensive and we need to indict the Deep State.
[02:14:34.331 --> 02:14:37.952]  We need to indict Big Tech for racketeering and suppression.
[02:14:38.752 --> 02:14:41.394]  And just every crime you can imagine, it's open and shut.
[02:14:41.394 --> 02:14:43.275]  We have to go after them.
[02:14:43.275 --> 02:14:44.275]  They're the authoritarians.
[02:14:44.275 --> 02:14:45.736]  They're the danger.
[02:14:45.736 --> 02:14:50.759]  Listen, I like President Trump, but I've already seen the top of Hollywood.
[02:14:50.759 --> 02:14:51.820]  I've seen the top of the U.S.
[02:14:51.820 --> 02:14:52.200]  government.
[02:14:52.200 --> 02:14:53.681]  I don't care about all that stuff.
[02:14:53.681 --> 02:14:54.882]  The pomp, the circumstance.
[02:14:54.882 --> 02:14:57.283]  I'm not looking for the pat on the head, Mr. President.
[02:14:57.283 --> 02:14:58.364]  I'm looking for action.
[02:15:02.844 --> 02:15:03.785]  That's all I'm asking for.
[02:15:03.785 --> 02:15:07.167]  And I know you're giving us action on so many fronts.
[02:15:07.167 --> 02:15:09.688]  I'm just simply telling you it's what the people want.
[02:15:09.688 --> 02:15:10.749]  It's what's right.
[02:15:10.749 --> 02:15:11.710]  It's what we need to see happen.
[02:15:12.844 --> 02:15:17.925]  But I know who can take action, and that's the listeners and the viewers of this broadcast.
[02:15:17.925 --> 02:15:21.726]  We are the voice and the heart and the soul, the spirit of Americana.
[02:15:21.726 --> 02:15:25.648]  The fusion of the Republic in 1776 with real Christianity.
[02:15:25.648 --> 02:15:29.789]  Not fake, in-your-face Pharisees, holier-than-thou stuff.
[02:15:29.789 --> 02:15:33.350]  Just, I love God, I want to take action, and I know you do too.
[02:15:33.350 --> 02:15:34.130]  Let's do it together.
[02:15:34.910 --> 02:15:43.701]  And that's why funding us and buying products at Infowars4.com and sign up for AutoShip to be able to, you know, recurring support us and get great profit at the same time is so critical.
[02:15:43.701 --> 02:15:45.543]  So just everybody, commit now.

[02:15:48.687 --> 02:15:51.210]  We need it now to not just stay on air, but expand.
[02:15:54.110 --> 02:15:57.152]  We can all agree these are troubled times, right?
[02:15:57.152 --> 02:16:00.053]  So do you know who's on your wireless network?

[02:18:54.568 --> 02:19:02.670]  We have been fighting so hard in the last two weeks that I've not even had time to cut new audio ads for this huge syndicated radio audience.
[02:19:02.670 --> 02:19:10.432]  And I apologize to radio listeners, I apologize for the fact that I'm cutting this on a phone as I drive down the road, but this is a war and we're getting it done any way we can.
[02:19:10.432 --> 02:19:14.933]  But we had huge sales in the New Year.
[02:19:14.933 --> 02:19:17.293]  Around Christmas into the New Year.
[02:19:17.293 --> 02:19:19.534]  But we sold the products at such low prices
[02:19:20.748 --> 02:19:23.793]  That he didn't bring in a lot of actual capital to fund our operations.
[02:19:23.793 --> 02:19:32.947]  And I'm expending massive amounts of money to put more than 15 people in Virginia, more than 10 people in DC, all next week for the trial of Trump.
[02:19:34.306 --> 02:19:39.407]  It's so critical we're there to confront the globalists and put out the counter-narrative of the truth to what they're doing.
[02:19:39.407 --> 02:19:40.667]  This is a real fight.

[02:19:57.810 --> 02:20:00.451]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:20:05.908 --> 02:20:07.289]  As recently as two weeks ago,
[02:20:37.819 --> 02:20:44.742]  HBO had a show on making fun of me for talking about Atrazine and the frogs becoming gay.
[02:20:44.742 --> 02:20:46.343]  I mean, they try to have sex with other males.
[02:20:46.343 --> 02:20:48.123]  They don't have babies.
[02:20:48.123 --> 02:20:48.603]  They die.
[02:20:48.603 --> 02:20:49.564]  They die in South Africa.
[02:20:49.564 --> 02:20:50.684]  They die in Australia.
[02:20:50.684 --> 02:20:51.405]  They die in Europe.
[02:20:51.405 --> 02:20:52.285]  They die in Houston.
[02:20:52.285 --> 02:21:04.150]  I mean, I saw reports where half the male frogs of one species were attracted to males and trying to fertilize them, and they're not fertilizing the female eggs, and they're dying.
[02:21:04.150 --> 02:21:04.570]  Not funny!
[02:21:07.110 --> 02:21:12.232]  But David Hogg, he comes out and says, Jones is trying to stop this being in the water.
[02:21:12.232 --> 02:21:14.572]  We need more gay people.
[02:21:14.572 --> 02:21:15.433]  And think about that.
[02:21:15.433 --> 02:21:20.754]  It's not attacking somebody, because I don't hate people for their sexual proclivity of their adults.
[02:21:20.754 --> 02:21:34.299]  But it's the targeting of the children, it's the whole sexualization, it's the chemicals that are hurting males, females, not just of our species, not just of the mammal kingdom, not just of homo sapiens sapien.
[02:21:37.483 --> 02:21:43.647]  But across the board, and they turn it into a joke when I was covering this 20-something years ago when it was mainline reports.
[02:21:43.647 --> 02:21:46.909]  Hell, Democracy Now!
[02:21:46.909 --> 02:21:49.271]  was covering this 20 years ago.
[02:21:49.271 --> 02:21:51.012]  It's not funny.
[02:21:51.012 --> 02:21:56.095]  But they make it into a big joke.
[02:21:56.095 --> 02:22:01.859]  So, Tucker Carlson last week had a big long piece on, I'm just going to play a few minutes, where he talked about Trump.
[02:22:03.550 --> 02:22:10.174]  And Trump's EPA, that most of the things Trump's done, like saying, turn the coal power plants back on, that's great.
[02:22:10.174 --> 02:22:14.176]  Only water and carbon dioxide come out of those.
[02:22:14.176 --> 02:22:15.377]  Nobody else has to make cuts.
[02:22:15.377 --> 02:22:18.799]  China has all the dirty ones, so does India.
[02:22:18.799 --> 02:22:24.042]  We know that, again, 90% of the pollution comes out of those two countries alone.
[02:22:24.042 --> 02:22:26.144]  So why is the EPA
[02:22:27.759 --> 02:22:46.170]  Going in and trying to weaken restrictions on Atrazine, when Atrazine is on record causing massive cancer, destroying male fertility, and manipulating, across the board, the brain tissue of males and females.
[02:22:47.822 --> 02:22:52.564]  And manipulating humans at the Endrican level.
[02:22:52.564 --> 02:22:57.927]  And so it has all sorts of effects, feminizing men.
[02:22:57.927 --> 02:23:11.593]  And how it works is when men are fed female chemicals, or chemicals that mimic that, it does in some men trigger an attraction to the same sex.
[02:23:11.593 --> 02:23:14.355]  Berkley News, Pesticide Adversary can turn male frogs into females.
[02:23:15.506 --> 02:23:24.529]  So you see the whole trans movement, the genitals physically on western males, you can be black, you can be white, you can be Asian, are getting smaller.
[02:23:24.529 --> 02:23:25.910]  The testicles are getting smaller.
[02:23:25.910 --> 02:23:27.871]  The sperm counts are way lower.
[02:23:27.871 --> 02:23:30.392]  It's killing us.
[02:23:30.392 --> 02:23:32.352]  The side effect is smaller genitals.
[02:23:32.352 --> 02:23:34.053]  People make jokes about it.
[02:23:34.053 --> 02:23:36.134]  You're being killed, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:23:39.915 --> 02:23:44.858]  And even the smallest amounts of it will irrevocably mess somebody up.
[02:23:44.858 --> 02:23:47.420]  So here's what Tucker Carlson had to say about it.
[02:23:47.420 --> 02:23:52.603]  Despite its name, the Environmental Protection Agency doesn't just exist to protect the environment.
[02:23:52.603 --> 02:23:58.467]  It also exists to protect you by policing against the many pollutants that are generated by modern life.
[02:23:58.467 --> 02:24:03.651]  But soon the EPA will be doing a little bit less to protect you and a little bit more to protect big agriculture.
[02:24:04.271 --> 02:24:05.913]  Atrazine is a pesticide.
[02:24:05.913 --> 02:24:08.755]  It's the second most common one in the United States.
[02:24:08.755 --> 02:24:12.078]  Half of America's corn crop is treated with it.
[02:24:12.078 --> 02:24:15.641]  Atrazine is banned in the European Union, and here's why.
[02:24:15.641 --> 02:24:22.648]  When administered to male frogs, atrazine chemically castrates them, and even causes some to change their sex entirely.
[02:24:23.308 --> 02:24:26.192]  In humans, atrazine is an endocrine disruptor.
[02:24:26.192 --> 02:24:29.135]  That means it causes changes to your natural hormonal balance.
[02:24:29.135 --> 02:24:37.405]  For newborn boys, atrazine exposure in utero is correlated with lower birth weight, undescended testicles, and deformities to sex organs.
[02:24:38.326 --> 02:24:44.871]  Now, it may be that Atrazine's risk is low enough and its value is high enough that we don't need to ban it.
[02:24:44.871 --> 02:24:48.354]  But the EPA isn't just keeping Atrazine legal.
[02:24:48.354 --> 02:24:52.157]  It's decided to stop closely monitoring its use.
[02:24:52.157 --> 02:25:02.566]  Buried within a recent 60-page regulatory document, the EPA has announced it will soon end its Atrazine monitoring program, which tests drinking water to make certain that Atrazine levels are safe.
[02:25:03.347 --> 02:25:09.367]  According to the EPA, the risk is simply so low that it's not worth even checking to make sure the situation is under control.
[02:25:10.476 --> 02:25:16.278]  In fact, it's so low, they're allowing 50% more atrazine to enter America's waterways.
[02:25:16.278 --> 02:25:26.183]  Now, that's despite the fact that in 2017, the year where the most recent data are public, 30 million Americans had measurable amounts of atrazine in their tap water.
[02:25:26.183 --> 02:25:32.625]  Now, according to researchers at Purdue University, a single part per billion of atrazine may be linked to low birth weights.
[02:25:32.625 --> 02:25:37.027]  In Evansville, Illinois, the water is already testing at 22 parts per billion.
[02:25:37.027 --> 02:25:39.028]  For the EPA, that's not a concern.
[02:25:39.628 --> 02:25:42.949]  Their concern is corn.
[02:25:42.949 --> 02:25:45.149]  Ladies and gentlemen, corn is used as a filler.
[02:25:45.149 --> 02:26:00.353]  I don't have to apologize to corn farmers to tell them that you notice that farmers in those areas have a lot of cancers, a lot of problems, and your daughters can't have children, and your sons basically can't have sex because they don't have genitals.
[02:26:00.353 --> 02:26:05.874]  Now, I mean, you heard, that's putting it lightly, that the testicles don't descend on a lot of people.
[02:26:05.874 --> 02:26:06.774]  That's what gets reported.
[02:26:09.008 --> 02:26:15.136]  But, you know, if dad's wondering why he had a good-sized Johnson and his son basically doesn't have a penis, it's because of Atrazine.
[02:26:15.136 --> 02:26:15.436]  Okay?
[02:26:15.436 --> 02:26:17.779]  It's not a laughing matter.
[02:26:17.779 --> 02:26:20.823]  So, and of course those cancerous sons are going to get.
[02:26:20.823 --> 02:26:26.130]  So, they need to ban Atrazine and they've got a lot of other pesticides that don't do this.
[02:26:26.130 --> 02:26:27.072]  Still not good for your liver.
[02:26:28.080 --> 02:26:33.748]  But atrazine bioaccumulates in the corn, and it gets into the water table, and it stays there for years.
[02:26:33.748 --> 02:26:37.694]  So I'm going to tell farmers something, and yeah, I'm going to try to fund ourselves at the same time.
[02:26:37.694 --> 02:26:42.001]  If you live and get municipal water, or you've got well water, or you live anywhere near farming,
[02:26:43.260 --> 02:26:53.187]  You are insane if you don't use a gravity-fed filter that takes out all the bad chemicals but leaves the good minerals in.
[02:26:53.187 --> 02:26:58.750]  And that's the Alexa Pure Breeze, the highest rated filtration system you're going to find out there for anywhere near the price.
[02:26:58.750 --> 02:27:02.673]  Top rated for 33% off it at FullWorthStore.com.
[02:27:02.673 --> 02:27:11.979]  I religiously, if I catch my daughters or my son drinking out of a water fountain at school, they're grounded for weeks.
[02:27:11.979 --> 02:27:12.800]  If I catch them
[02:27:14.212 --> 02:27:22.794]  Not drinking, reverse osmosis, distilled, or out of the filters we have at the office of the house, I chew them out.
[02:27:22.794 --> 02:27:24.854]  And we're not weirdo neurotics.
[02:27:24.854 --> 02:27:30.335]  When I go to most restaurants and places, I've got my own packet of tea.
[02:27:30.335 --> 02:27:31.416]  I've got my own drink.
[02:27:31.416 --> 02:27:33.936]  And I can bottle water and I make it right there.
[02:27:33.936 --> 02:27:35.276]  And I ask them for a glass and I make it.
[02:27:35.276 --> 02:27:36.917]  And people say, why are you doing that?
[02:27:36.917 --> 02:27:38.937]  And I said, oh, because I don't like cancer.
[02:27:38.937 --> 02:27:42.758]  The number one thing you can do is stop bad water getting into your body.
[02:27:44.093 --> 02:27:44.353]  I don't
[02:28:02.461 --> 02:28:05.923]  EPA to do this, and it's serious.
[02:28:05.923 --> 02:28:19.589]  And it's not just the Atrazine, but if you don't get a water filtration system and reduce it as much as you can, and if you don't get the systems we sell are some of the highest rated shower filters, they don't cut everything out, they cut it back 99% or so.
[02:28:19.589 --> 02:28:21.130]  This goes even more than that.
[02:28:21.130 --> 02:28:23.871]  But you're not breathing in it, it's not in your biggest organ, your skin.
[02:28:23.871 --> 02:28:30.895]  If you love your children, filter your water, your bath water, your rain water, all of it.
[02:28:32.188 --> 02:28:34.330]  It's all got crap in it.
[02:28:34.330 --> 02:28:37.312]  It's the front line of defense for your body, and it funds the InfoWar.

[02:28:54.013 --> 02:29:05.202]  Attention GCN self-reliance listeners, if you've ever wanted an emergency solar survival backup system, but were waiting for prices too crazy to pass up, this will be the most important message you'll ever hear.
[02:29:05.202 --> 02:29:12.087]  Bill Hyde here and I want to tell you about a huge sale with historically low prices on our PPX microgrid system that's going to let you produce an
[02:29:12.307 --> 02:29:12.727]  I don't know.
[02:29:35.336 --> 02:29:37.157]  Knock on wood, I am not tempting fate.
[02:29:37.157 --> 02:29:40.319]  But everybody around the office, especially folks that have worked here a long time,
[02:30:04.318 --> 02:30:07.099]  I've noticed that I really don't ever get sick.
[02:30:07.099 --> 02:30:10.721]  Now, again, I might get sick tomorrow, because I just made that statement.
[02:30:10.721 --> 02:30:12.001]  I'm not tempting fate.
[02:30:12.001 --> 02:30:15.122]  I'll say that again, because I am superstitious when it comes down to that.
[02:30:15.122 --> 02:30:19.744]  I'm very thankful to the good Lord for the Constitution I've been given.
[02:30:19.744 --> 02:30:28.648]  But up until about eight, nine years ago, when I started taking X2 and the products to enforce life, I still got sick every couple of years.
[02:30:29.750 --> 02:30:33.872]  And, you know, I still get sore throats from allergies and pollen and things like that.
[02:30:33.872 --> 02:30:45.219]  But now that I religiously take the products at InfoWars Life, one of the highest quality supplements you're going to find out there, I just never get a fever anymore.
[02:30:45.219 --> 02:30:50.442]  It's probably been three, four years since I've had a fever.
[02:30:50.442 --> 02:30:51.803]  It's just crazy.
[02:30:51.803 --> 02:30:53.944]  So I chalk it up to genetics and the great products.
[02:30:54.741 --> 02:30:58.563]  Since the beginning, Secret 12 has been one of our most popular formulas.
[02:30:58.563 --> 02:31:03.426]  Now we're bringing you an all-new version of your favorite formula to help you reach your energy peak.
[02:31:03.426 --> 02:31:12.330]  Ultra 12 from InfoWars Life takes advantage of the most effective and expensive form of B12 available, Methylgobalamin, to provide you with twice the B12.
[02:31:12.330 --> 02:31:19.514]  Ultra 12 can help make DNA, support the body's energy production, and help produce healthy blood cells while assisting proper nervous system function.
[02:31:19.514 --> 02:31:24.057]  Help support your energy levels and take advantage of the superior form of B12 today with Ultra 12.
[02:31:24.597 --> 02:31:27.621]  It's no secret that our daily lives are becoming more stressful.
[02:31:27.621 --> 02:31:32.228]  No matter what side of the political spectrum you're on, we're all feeling the strain from rising pressure.
[02:31:32.228 --> 02:31:37.335]  That's why we worked hard to create a new formula to support your fight against stress in your hectic day.
[02:31:37.335 --> 02:31:41.521]  Chill Force is our solution for a true, healthy, relaxation support formula.
[02:31:41.781 --> 02:31:43.822]  I love watching David Knight in the morning.
[02:31:43.822 --> 02:31:45.443]  I love tuning in to Owen Troyer.
[02:31:45.443 --> 02:31:47.403]  I love all the other shows we do here.
[02:31:47.403 --> 02:31:48.724]  But I'll be honest with you.
[02:31:48.724 --> 02:31:52.225]  We run, during the breaks, a lot of news reports because I'm sick of hearing the ads.
[02:31:52.225 --> 02:31:54.666]  So, you think you don't want to hear an ad?
[02:31:54.666 --> 02:31:55.587]  I don't want to hear an ad.
[02:32:10.603 --> 02:32:11.247]  Here's the bottom line.
[02:32:12.270 --> 02:32:13.730]  We're barely paying the bills here.
[02:32:13.730 --> 02:32:16.431]  And I want to expand in the face of the globalists, not contract.
[02:32:16.431 --> 02:32:17.571]  I don't want them to win.
[02:32:17.571 --> 02:32:20.512]  So listen, you've got this guarantee from me.
[02:32:20.512 --> 02:32:23.612]  We sell enough product, we'll have less ads and less plugs.
[02:32:23.612 --> 02:32:26.773]  And we'll expand and really give the globalists a run for their money.
[02:32:26.773 --> 02:32:30.574]  But we've got products you already really need, like DNA Force Plus, X2.
[02:32:30.574 --> 02:32:32.134]  These will change your life.
[02:32:32.134 --> 02:32:33.534]  Go check out the turmeric products.
[02:32:33.534 --> 02:32:35.555]  Check out the water filtration, air filtration.
[02:32:35.555 --> 02:32:36.255]  Check it all out.
[02:32:36.255 --> 02:32:38.195]  Whatever you do, take action and know.
[02:32:38.195 --> 02:32:39.976]  Be part of the second American revolution.
[02:32:39.976 --> 02:32:41.176]  Be part of crushing the globalists.
[02:32:41.596 --> 02:32:43.537]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[02:33:21.107 --> 02:33:29.911]  From deep in the heart of FEMA Region 6, Austin, Texas, transmitting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:29.911 --> 02:33:33.433]  Storm clouds are above Washington, D.C.
[02:33:36.371 --> 02:33:42.374]  Our reporters are on the ground giving continual live coverage at band.video and infowars.com forward slash show.
[02:33:42.374 --> 02:33:47.156]  We fuse it all together here with a radio slash TV transmission.
[02:33:47.156 --> 02:33:47.677]  We're live.
[02:33:49.256 --> 02:33:49.956]  10 hours a day.
[02:33:49.956 --> 02:33:51.277]  I'd like to be live more.
[02:33:51.277 --> 02:33:55.379]  But we're just working on getting the crew and the operations and the money.
[02:33:55.379 --> 02:33:57.580]  Love Will Johnson and the work he's been doing as a reporter for us.
[02:33:57.580 --> 02:33:59.341]  I had to suspend that show for a while.
[02:33:59.341 --> 02:34:00.241]  We just didn't have the crew.
[02:34:00.241 --> 02:34:05.863]  A couple of folks had to leave because they had family members that were sick to take care of in different parts of the country that have been here years.
[02:34:05.863 --> 02:34:13.747]  I mean, we're that ragtag of an organization that when we go on the road, we're the biggest crew as we had.
[02:34:15.626 --> 02:34:18.907]  We have a skeleton crew back here that's working 18 hours a day.
[02:34:18.907 --> 02:34:20.707]  So I want to thank the listeners for the support.
[02:34:20.707 --> 02:34:24.869]  But listen, this isn't a passion for making money.
[02:34:24.869 --> 02:34:27.229]  It's not a passion for being famous.
[02:34:27.229 --> 02:34:30.070]  It's not a passion for any of that.
[02:34:30.070 --> 02:34:30.870]  I'm not going to lie to you.
[02:34:30.870 --> 02:34:31.790]  I like a good steak dinner.
[02:34:31.790 --> 02:34:33.031]  I like driving a good fast car.
[02:34:33.031 --> 02:34:36.152]  I like having money for medical care for my kids.
[02:34:36.152 --> 02:34:39.913]  I like not having to worry about, you know, having money in the bank.
[02:34:39.913 --> 02:34:42.713]  But that's where it ends.
[02:34:42.713 --> 02:34:44.794]  I want to secure our freedoms and our liberty.
[02:34:46.089 --> 02:34:47.330]  And that's most important.
[02:34:47.330 --> 02:34:53.473]  So I will fight the globalists until I'm living in a shack.
[02:34:53.473 --> 02:34:56.896]  Because it's our rights and our freedoms that are the most valuable.
[02:34:56.896 --> 02:35:00.938]  I do all this and I fight hard like this because I'm just like you.
[02:35:00.938 --> 02:35:02.599]  I don't want to be a slave.
[02:35:02.599 --> 02:35:08.603]  And I know our hard-fought rights are under real sustained assault.
[02:35:08.603 --> 02:35:12.405]  But just since we started waking up, the tide's turning all over the world.
[02:35:14.906 --> 02:35:17.287]  And the enemy's trying to just wear us out.
[02:35:17.287 --> 02:35:24.291]  So, something hit me, and then I want to finish up with this news, and it's all the other news, and Mike Adams coming up.
[02:35:24.291 --> 02:35:27.233]  Something really hit me during the break.
[02:35:27.233 --> 02:35:30.775]  I was back there in the coffee room.
[02:35:30.775 --> 02:35:35.297]  I've been visiting that a little bit more today, because I didn't have much sleep while I was out of town, so I'm exhausted.
[02:35:35.297 --> 02:35:36.978]  Usually just have maybe two cups by now.
[02:35:36.978 --> 02:35:39.820]  I'm on, like, cup number four of this Wake Up America coffee.
[02:35:42.418 --> 02:35:45.780]  Which is very strong, so I'm being a very bad boy right now, but it is good.
[02:35:45.780 --> 02:35:50.323]  Whoever knew getting high was so delicious?
[02:35:50.323 --> 02:35:51.303]  Anyways, continuing.
[02:35:51.303 --> 02:35:57.007]  And I was watching Adam Schiff.
[02:35:57.007 --> 02:35:58.768]  Ted Bucks, big buddy.
[02:35:58.768 --> 02:36:04.731]  Par for the course.
[02:36:04.731 --> 02:36:05.452]  And it just hit me.
[02:36:07.366 --> 02:36:09.187]  And when I say this, it's going to be incredibly obvious.
[02:36:09.187 --> 02:36:12.508]  You're going to go, wow, Alex, tell us the grass is green next.
[02:36:12.508 --> 02:36:32.118]  But of all the reasons they keep this impeachment going and the fake investigations going and all of it is, first and foremost, to change the subject from what losers they are and how their cities are collapsing and how corrupt they are and how evil they are, and to keep Trump on the defense and to hog up all the time and energy and to be the center of attention.
[02:36:35.555 --> 02:37:00.418]  But the reason they gotta keep the impeachment going as long as possible is they're racing to dig up more fake dirt, more news scandals, and they just can't believe that they've never found, with giant illegal dragnets and phone company records and harassment and threats, to put all these people in prison.
[02:37:00.418 --> 02:37:01.819]  They've done all of that!
[02:37:03.027 --> 02:37:04.088]  All of it!
[02:37:04.088 --> 02:37:06.290]  And they haven't found anything Trump's done.
[02:37:06.290 --> 02:37:09.112]  Because Trump's a straight shooter.
[02:37:09.112 --> 02:37:12.234]  He does everything he does out in the open, knowing everybody's trying to set him up.
[02:37:12.234 --> 02:37:15.236]  I mean, I've always been a straight-laced guy.
[02:37:15.236 --> 02:37:15.557]  Okay?
[02:37:15.557 --> 02:37:17.078]  Very conservative.
[02:37:17.078 --> 02:37:20.260]  You know, I'm guilty of having too much coffee.
[02:37:20.260 --> 02:37:21.821]  Don't even speed anymore.
[02:37:21.821 --> 02:37:22.822]  Down the road.
[02:37:22.822 --> 02:37:24.363]  Let's say I've cut back massively.
[02:37:24.363 --> 02:37:25.144]  Kind of a white lie.
[02:37:25.144 --> 02:37:26.605]  Every once in a while I get a little bit of power.
[02:37:26.605 --> 02:37:28.907]  A little bit of a jolt there.
[02:37:28.907 --> 02:37:31.349]  Get 120 on that country road when I'm by myself.
[02:37:35.936 --> 02:37:41.880]  When you are prominent and are in the public eye, people are trying to set you up for stuff you haven't done.
[02:37:41.880 --> 02:37:47.104]  So it doesn't even surprise me they can't find anything on Trump.
[02:37:47.104 --> 02:37:54.269]  Because he's been 50 years people trying to put his ass in prison, trying to shake him down.
[02:37:54.269 --> 02:37:56.991]  And so that's why they're so upset and why they're so scared.
[02:37:56.991 --> 02:37:58.693]  Because with them, you can't swing a stick.
[02:38:00.069 --> 02:38:00.990]  And not hit corruption.
[02:38:00.990 --> 02:38:02.251]  Notice that's what they're telling you.
[02:38:02.251 --> 02:38:03.792]  Oh, Hillary's emails are for corruption.
[02:38:03.792 --> 02:38:05.554]  It's a crime to put those out.
[02:38:05.554 --> 02:38:07.575]  Oh, you exposed what we're doing in Ukraine.
[02:38:07.575 --> 02:38:10.498]  Oh, you're a criminal for that.
[02:38:10.498 --> 02:38:17.964]  It's a total inversion of reality.
[02:38:17.964 --> 02:38:21.327]  And that's all this is, is sucking all the oxygen out of the room.
[02:38:21.327 --> 02:38:21.827]  And so that's why
[02:38:23.106 --> 02:38:26.568]  I'm not going to cover the impeachment very much or the trial.
[02:38:26.568 --> 02:38:35.114]  When Republicans do their defense after almost three and a half, four months of this BS, I will cover that.
[02:38:35.114 --> 02:38:42.179]  And our recruits on the ground, they'll be there bringing up issues to globalists and friendly confrontations and journalism, and we'll have them on.
[02:38:42.179 --> 02:38:46.121]  But I'm just not going to commit the lion's share of the broadcast.
[02:38:46.121 --> 02:38:52.846]  And I think you agree with me listening to Adam Schiff, because every time he opens his mouth, another lie or half-truth or twisted garbage comes out.
[02:38:58.703 --> 02:39:02.306]  Now I wanted to finish up on the whole at-the-zine and what it's doing to people.
[02:39:02.306 --> 02:39:06.951]  BlazeTV ran into me at the Virginia Rally and this is part of what I had to say.
[02:39:23.242 --> 02:39:40.536]  I would love to take credit 20 years ago when it was in Berkeley Science Reports and other top research reports that Atrazine sterilizes and reduces fertility of amphibians, of fish, of birds, but also of mammals.
[02:39:41.156 --> 02:39:45.021]  And so, but what it does is it also confuses males, and then that's what happens to frogs.
[02:39:45.021 --> 02:39:50.387]  They want to have sex with the male frog, but then they don't have any eggs, and so the frogs die.
[02:39:50.387 --> 02:39:55.553]  And so I said, listen, I'm not against gay people, I just don't want to put chemicals in the water to make the friggin frogs gay.
[02:39:55.553 --> 02:39:58.437]  And the media, every late night comic, they all attack me.
[02:39:58.677 --> 02:40:07.879]  Knowing full damn well that atrazine is a very toxic chemical and even tiny amounts of it will literally basically shrivel your balls and everything else up so you don't even have a sex life.
[02:40:07.879 --> 02:40:08.140]  Okay?
[02:40:08.140 --> 02:40:09.360]  And it'll fry your brain.
[02:40:09.360 --> 02:40:11.300]  And so it doesn't just, quote, make you gay.
[02:40:11.300 --> 02:40:16.982]  That was just something the media picked up on, even though studies show it makes the male frogs want to have sex with the other male frogs.
[02:40:17.382 --> 02:40:34.607]  Okay, so it screws up their olfactory nerve, everything, and then it turns out the Pentagon had, this is BBC News, this is Reuters 25 years ago, a gay bomb that was made up of a mixture of LSD and Atrazine, where they would spray it on groups of troops, and the men would start flipping out, literally having sex with each other.
[02:40:35.007 --> 02:40:36.988]  So, that's what chemicals can do.
[02:40:36.988 --> 02:40:38.568]  That's what our noses do.
[02:40:38.568 --> 02:40:40.929]  That's why my wife's right here.
[02:40:40.929 --> 02:40:41.950]  I smell my wife.
[02:40:41.950 --> 02:40:44.131]  I mean, she smells really damn good, okay?
[02:40:44.131 --> 02:40:46.411]  But you got a bunch of atrazine.
[02:40:46.411 --> 02:40:47.872]  Well, then a dude starts smelling good to you.
[02:40:47.872 --> 02:40:49.032]  You know, it's kind of like a pizza.
[02:40:49.032 --> 02:40:49.693]  Smells really good.
[02:40:49.693 --> 02:40:51.953]  Doesn't even really look that good, but you know, it smells good.
[02:40:51.953 --> 02:40:52.514]  You eat it.
[02:40:52.514 --> 02:40:55.335]  Well, imagine you take this stuff or these chemicals get you.
[02:40:55.335 --> 02:40:56.655]  Dude starts smelling good.
[02:40:56.655 --> 02:40:58.936]  So, Dave and Hogg and all make a big joke about it.
[02:40:58.936 --> 02:40:59.876]  It's not funny.
[02:40:59.876 --> 02:41:01.377]  It totally takes over your brain.
[02:41:01.377 --> 02:41:02.237]  It gives you cancer.
[02:41:02.237 --> 02:41:03.718]  There's a whole bunch of other crap.
[02:41:07.079 --> 02:41:11.741]  One of the side effects is, in mammals and in so many other things, is that it literally makes you attractive.
[02:41:11.741 --> 02:41:13.921]  Why are they loosening up regulations on it then recently?
[02:41:13.921 --> 02:41:14.501]  That was just covered.
[02:41:14.501 --> 02:41:15.862]  They're loosening up regulations on aphrodisiacs.
[02:41:15.862 --> 02:41:18.643]  Yes, I saw that Tucker Carlson on Friday attacked Trump.
[02:41:18.643 --> 02:41:19.543]  He's absolutely right.
[02:41:19.543 --> 02:41:24.345]  Okay, so there's this part of that report and the reason I play that is I got asked that by...
[02:41:25.424 --> 02:41:27.345]  Fox News that was there, local Fox News.
[02:41:27.345 --> 02:41:28.846]  I got asked that by Blaze TV.
[02:41:28.846 --> 02:41:30.747]  Full reports on Band.Video.
[02:41:30.747 --> 02:41:32.008]  I got asked that by a lot of people.
[02:41:32.008 --> 02:41:32.908]  Hey!
[02:41:32.908 --> 02:41:33.869]  The gay frogs are real.
[02:41:33.869 --> 02:41:36.290]  Tucker Carlson covered it.
[02:41:36.290 --> 02:41:39.112]  But again, it's the dead frogs.
[02:41:39.112 --> 02:41:41.113]  It's not the gay frogs, it's the dead frogs.
[02:41:41.113 --> 02:41:44.215]  And I'm just sitting here thinking about solutions.
[02:41:44.215 --> 02:41:51.099]  One thing is the public, just like Epstein, or just about world government, are now waking up to it so we can do something about it.
[02:41:51.099 --> 02:41:52.920]  And notice the EPA is pushing back saying,
[02:41:54.670 --> 02:42:03.954]  We're not even going to count it as bad anymore because its levels are going up and people get pissed when they see it in the reports.
[02:42:03.954 --> 02:42:06.976]  Fukushima hit the West Coast at hundreds of times safe levels.
[02:42:06.976 --> 02:42:07.696]  That was in the news.
[02:42:07.696 --> 02:42:08.997]  It was confirmed by universities.
[02:42:08.997 --> 02:42:14.499]  They went, oh, we'll just raise the level and say it's safe and stop reporting these other levels because we now say it's safe.
[02:42:14.499 --> 02:42:20.482]  That's really what they did because your local health departments and others are testing the water under federal grants.
[02:42:21.806 --> 02:42:27.155]  And the EPA says, we don't want that tested anymore, because now you're aware.
[02:42:27.155 --> 02:42:30.460]  Big article, Americans exposed to toxic chemicals in drinking water.
[02:42:30.460 --> 02:42:33.124]  Dramatically underestimated.
[02:42:33.124 --> 02:42:36.330]  Fox News has a big report put out by the federal government and other groups.
[02:42:38.786 --> 02:42:40.208]  There it is!
[02:42:40.208 --> 02:42:42.551]  They're hitting us through the water.
[02:42:42.551 --> 02:42:48.579]  So yes, let's defend our right to Second Amendment, but the right to defend ourselves is knowing what's going on through the water.
[02:42:48.579 --> 02:42:49.480]  The water.
[02:42:49.480 --> 02:42:50.341]  The air.
[02:42:50.341 --> 02:42:53.045]  That's where the shadow government deep state technocracy is hitting us.
[02:42:54.076 --> 02:43:06.899]  This is a call for modern-day Paul Reveres, who are all Americans, who are all human beings, who bleed red blood, love God, and love justice, and who have awakened to the New World Order threat.
[02:43:06.899 --> 02:43:17.841]  You are the modern Paul Reveres, and without you, no one knows about Band-Odd Video and our live coverage of the attempt to remove the President in the Senate trial and the Deep State trying to trigger
[02:43:21.630 --> 02:43:22.431]  I don't know.
[02:43:37.998 --> 02:43:38.298]  I'm good.
[02:43:54.457 --> 02:43:58.100]  It's time to take a new, healthier approach to one of your most basic needs.

[02:44:51.044 --> 02:44:53.386]  InfoWars, brought to you by you.
[02:44:54.744 --> 02:45:00.570]  I wanted to talk about Super Silver Whitening Toothpaste because I hadn't tried it except for maybe the last week and a half.
[02:45:00.570 --> 02:45:04.113]  And I told Alex, I said, man, this is the best toothpaste I've ever tried.
[02:45:04.113 --> 02:45:06.415]  He's like, well, what are you doing just sitting in here telling me?
[02:45:06.415 --> 02:45:08.237]  You got to get up there and tell people.
[02:45:08.237 --> 02:45:15.824]  So here I am telling people Super Silver Whitening Toothpaste is by far the best toothpaste I've ever tried.
[02:45:15.824 --> 02:45:16.344]  And I'm 45 years old.
[02:45:17.065 --> 02:45:19.026]  And I've tried a lot of different toothpaste.
[02:45:19.026 --> 02:45:20.727]  And it's fluoride free.
[02:45:20.727 --> 02:45:23.988]  I think the big difference, the game changer in this is the coral calcium.
[02:45:23.988 --> 02:45:27.590]  Because after I brush my teeth with this, they feel so clean.
[02:45:27.590 --> 02:45:32.272]  And the toothpaste, I don't even like rinse out my mouth after I brush my teeth with this.
[02:45:32.272 --> 02:45:34.493]  It feels so good.
[02:45:34.493 --> 02:45:37.715]  It feels like good things are happening in my mouth.
[02:45:37.715 --> 02:45:43.918]  In fact, I find myself brushing my teeth three to four times a day rather than just twice a day now.
[02:45:43.918 --> 02:45:45.579]  Because I like the way it feels.
[02:45:54.907 --> 02:45:59.028]  I would thank you for everything you've done for the Infowar, but I know you're like me.
[02:45:59.028 --> 02:46:00.949]  You don't want my thanks.
[02:46:00.949 --> 02:46:06.910]  You want victory over the globalists and these devil worshipping child molesters, and you want them off your back and off your children's back.
[02:46:06.910 --> 02:46:08.091]  And you know what?
[02:46:08.091 --> 02:46:11.371]  I'm the same way, and that's why we're on the same damn team.
[02:46:11.371 --> 02:46:15.713]  And it's why Infowars has been delivering time and time again when it's clutch time to
[02:46:17.987 --> 02:46:26.069]  Focus the people on taking action against the globalists, because I'm committed to a future for humanity, and I know you are as well.
[02:46:26.069 --> 02:46:34.171]  So thank you in 2019 for standing with us, because you are the InfoWar, and I want to thank you for committing to stand with us in 2020 however you can.
[02:46:34.171 --> 02:46:42.853]  From the bottom of my heart, from my family, and from the great crew at InfoWars, I want to thank you all because you are the InfoWar, and you know that's not just words, that's reality.
[02:46:43.911 --> 02:46:45.532]  You have made history.
[02:46:45.532 --> 02:46:46.753]  We have made history together.
[02:46:46.753 --> 02:46:51.995]  Infowars.com only has power because of you.
[02:46:51.995 --> 02:46:58.338]  And I suggest you use it.
[02:46:58.338 --> 02:47:00.980]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:47:11.021 --> 02:47:18.506]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[02:47:18.506 --> 02:47:27.331]  In defiance of the globalist deep state, the White House is listening to InfoWars right now.
[02:47:27.331 --> 02:47:33.315]  Several offices have war rooms with big TVs all over the walls.
[02:47:33.315 --> 02:47:36.597]  They're monitoring the news, and InfoWars is right there at the center.
[02:47:36.597 --> 02:47:37.418]  They're watching right now.
[02:47:38.598 --> 02:47:39.559]  People noticed this.
[02:47:39.559 --> 02:47:46.945]  The media noticed it three, four years ago and said, oh my gosh, we've got to shut Alex Jones down or we've got to ban Trump seeing Infowars.
[02:47:46.945 --> 02:47:52.791]  But the truth is, once you see the perspective of how the globalists work, everything then makes sense.
[02:47:52.791 --> 02:47:55.993]  Not from their narrative, then it makes no sense.
[02:47:55.993 --> 02:48:00.057]  But when you know the real globalist narrative, you already know what's in WikiLeaks before you read it.
[02:48:00.057 --> 02:48:01.658]  And then sure enough, there it is.
[02:48:01.658 --> 02:48:05.602]  Hillary talking to a top professor of psychology on how to create a race war in America.
[02:48:07.688 --> 02:48:10.310]  They talk about, no one believes us, everyone hates us now.
[02:48:10.310 --> 02:48:11.630]  We can't give everybody free money.
[02:48:11.630 --> 02:48:12.291]  What are we going to do?
[02:48:12.291 --> 02:48:14.873]  Well, just have a race war.
[02:48:14.873 --> 02:48:17.214]  Have more culture war.
[02:48:17.214 --> 02:48:20.396]  So the globalists think they can stop the signal.
[02:48:20.396 --> 02:48:21.557]  It's not even a signal.
[02:48:21.557 --> 02:48:25.719]  Once you have the perspective, like looking at a piece of architecture, you don't see the building from the right angle.
[02:48:25.719 --> 02:48:31.123]  Once you get the right angle, you can see the whole structure, basically.
[02:48:31.123 --> 02:48:32.504]  From one angle, they can play tricks on you.
[02:48:33.317 --> 02:48:49.211]  So I keep pointing out that China and India and a whole bunch of third world countries are responsible for almost all the pollution and on purpose dump it right in the ocean and on purpose have no controls and then notice the White House has picked that up recently and so have all the cartoonists and people.
[02:48:49.211 --> 02:48:54.276]  That's not rocket science, that's the truth!
[02:48:54.276 --> 02:49:00.061]  But there's other examples like weeks before Trump a few years ago said why does the Pope say get rid of
[02:49:02.130 --> 02:49:05.911]  Walls in Europe are the US, but they've got 200 foot walls around the Vatican.
[02:49:05.911 --> 02:49:07.612]  That was a common sense call.
[02:49:07.612 --> 02:49:09.072]  We were the first to point it out.
[02:49:09.072 --> 02:49:10.793]  The meme got picked up everywhere.
[02:49:10.793 --> 02:49:12.813]  Trump retweeted it.
[02:49:12.813 --> 02:49:14.574]  It's not about getting credit.
[02:49:14.574 --> 02:49:19.996]  It's about learning why our audience, who see stuff before I do, I'm not kissing your ass, it's true.
[02:49:19.996 --> 02:49:22.777]  You're the type of people that are looking at things from different angles.
[02:49:22.777 --> 02:49:23.957]  You're trying to figure it out.
[02:49:23.957 --> 02:49:27.098]  You're not just taking it at face value like you've never jumped off a
[02:49:29.181 --> 02:49:30.742]  Some rocks in a creek you've never been to.
[02:49:30.742 --> 02:49:32.584]  Looks crystal clear, looks 20 feet deep.
[02:49:32.584 --> 02:49:39.130]  You're gonna crawl down there first and make sure there's not any hidden rocks or anything or some barbed wire down there from a washed in.
[02:49:39.130 --> 02:49:41.392]  You're gonna swim in there before you jump in there.
[02:49:41.392 --> 02:49:43.213]  Even though it looks safe.
[02:49:43.213 --> 02:49:44.995]  Hey, hey kids, don't jump off there yet.
[02:49:44.995 --> 02:49:46.576]  Let me swim around here and check it.
[02:49:46.576 --> 02:49:47.637]  That's all we do.
[02:49:47.637 --> 02:49:52.822]  We don't just receive what we're told and just buy it.
[02:49:52.822 --> 02:49:56.005]  And so that's why Trump is synced with us because he's the same way.
[02:49:57.554 --> 02:49:59.715]  And when he gets the right info, he makes the right decision.
[02:49:59.715 --> 02:50:02.796]  And that's why they're so pissed.
[02:50:02.796 --> 02:50:06.437]  And so that's the Trump phenomenon, is that he's really the president.
[02:50:06.437 --> 02:50:07.078]  And he's winning.
[02:50:07.078 --> 02:50:10.519]  And he's starting to get control of the executive branch.
[02:50:10.519 --> 02:50:18.762]  And they've got all these articles and headlines about, oh, the odds are he's going to beat the Senate trial for impeachment and he's going to get re-elected.
[02:50:18.762 --> 02:50:20.883]  That's when you've got to watch out, though, folks.
[02:50:20.883 --> 02:50:26.485]  And I want to talk more in the days and weeks to come about the Achilles heel of Trump, only 285 days out to the election. 285.
[02:50:28.186 --> 02:50:34.529]  Because we all heard Hillary was invincible, and that's why I said she was going to lose.
[02:50:34.529 --> 02:50:42.193]  Maiden voyage of the Titanic, they said not even God can sink this ship.
[02:50:42.193 --> 02:50:54.180]  They are on purpose saying Trump's a shoo-in now, because they're planning to plunge the economy, they're planning to start wars to embarrass the president, they're planning to use biocrises, they use everything.
[02:50:56.656 --> 02:51:02.699]  And so, the President needs to know that he's walking into a trap with election fraud, and of course he's going to win in a landslide.
[02:51:02.699 --> 02:51:04.199]  If we have a free and fair election.
[02:51:04.199 --> 02:51:05.140]  We're not.
[02:51:05.140 --> 02:51:11.023]  They've got illegal aliens registering to vote all over the country publicly now.
[02:51:11.023 --> 02:51:16.085]  Handing out the driver's license.
[02:51:16.085 --> 02:51:17.846]  Hillary was a paper tiger.
[02:51:17.846 --> 02:51:19.606]  Trump isn't.
[02:51:19.606 --> 02:51:22.808]  But when you start thinking you're invincible, that's right when the fall happens.
[02:51:24.110 --> 02:51:27.792]  Now, I've been saying, why doesn't he counter Greta Thunberg?
[02:51:30.060 --> 02:51:37.483]  For the fact that she never talks about China and India and how they are absolutely polluting on purpose.
[02:51:37.483 --> 02:51:39.163]  Especially China.
[02:51:39.163 --> 02:51:41.064]  India's trying to industrialize.
[02:51:41.064 --> 02:51:45.266]  China, and I'm not defending it, but China is doing it on purpose as worse as they can.
[02:51:45.266 --> 02:51:47.026]  Economic warfare against us.
[02:51:47.026 --> 02:51:49.487]  Funding shutting down our coal plants.
[02:51:49.487 --> 02:51:51.468]  Shipping toxic waste here.
[02:51:51.468 --> 02:51:53.609]  Just doing everything evil you can imagine.
[02:51:53.609 --> 02:51:54.929]  Shutting down our industries.
[02:51:54.929 --> 02:51:56.330]  Buying up Hollywood to brainwash us.
[02:51:58.212 --> 02:52:00.074]  Greta Thunberg's flying around these big jets.
[02:52:00.074 --> 02:52:01.154]  She says they're evil all day.
[02:52:01.154 --> 02:52:02.555]  That's not real pollution, folks.
[02:52:02.555 --> 02:52:04.557]  Radiation from reactors is.
[02:52:04.557 --> 02:52:06.438]  Dumping toxic waste in the ocean is.
[02:52:06.438 --> 02:52:16.386]  Genetic engineering is pollution that lasts forever in species and causes massive societal biosphere shutdowns.
[02:52:16.386 --> 02:52:27.695]  But again, the very people destroying the Earth, the globalists, that say it's a post-human, post-carbon world that follows some sick worship of AI silicon.
[02:52:29.585 --> 02:52:31.246]  Sand?
[02:52:31.246 --> 02:52:39.609]  Talk about castles made of sand will collapse into the sea eventually, to quote Jimi Hendrix.
[02:52:39.609 --> 02:52:48.052]  So they're the ones claiming they guard the environment all day, while they're the ones that are playing God and actually destroying it in masks and dumping at regime and everything.
[02:52:48.052 --> 02:52:56.995]  So Trump needs to be the champion of real environmentalism, not de-industrialization, anti-human environmentalism, that's meant to only empower authoritarian regimes and shut us down.
[02:52:56.995 --> 02:52:58.156]  And he's starting to do that.
[02:52:59.394 --> 02:53:02.076]  So these aren't talking points, these are truths.
[02:53:02.076 --> 02:53:09.862]  So here's a compilation of Trump at Davos today, countering Greta in live time, with her saying, I told you, I want you to panic!
[02:53:09.862 --> 02:53:10.902]  I am your boss!
[02:53:10.902 --> 02:53:15.426]  Everything is over if you don't do exactly as I say to you now!
[02:53:15.426 --> 02:53:17.948]  Punish me if you want to live!
[02:53:17.948 --> 02:53:20.550]  Humans are bad, do not have children!
[02:53:20.550 --> 02:53:23.672]  You are evil, especially if you are European!
[02:53:23.672 --> 02:53:26.734]  Here it is.
[02:53:26.734 --> 02:53:27.555]  How dare you!
[02:53:27.961 --> 02:53:36.884]  I think Greta ought to focus on those places, but we are doing better right now than we've ever done in terms of cleanliness, in terms of numbers.
[02:53:36.884 --> 02:53:42.406]  Because that world, in case you haven't noticed, is currently on fire.
[02:53:42.406 --> 02:53:51.329]  But to embrace the possibilities of tomorrow, we must reject the perennial prophets of doom and their predictions of the apocalypse.
[02:53:52.830 --> 02:54:04.174]  They are the heirs of yesterday's foolish fortune tellers who will never let radical socialists destroy our economy, wreck our country, or eradicate our liberty.
[02:54:04.174 --> 02:54:10.416]  America will always be the proud, strong, and unyielding bastion of freedom.
[02:54:10.416 --> 02:54:14.577]  We couldn't care less about your party politics.
[02:54:14.577 --> 02:54:21.380]  From a sustainability perspective, the right, the left, as well as the centre, have all failed.
[02:54:23.297 --> 02:54:27.420]  Our house is still on fire.
[02:54:27.420 --> 02:54:32.985]  Your inaction is fueling the flames by the hour.
[02:54:32.985 --> 02:54:39.590]  And we are telling you to act as if you loved your children above all else.
[02:54:39.590 --> 02:54:49.799]  Today I'm pleased to announce the United States will join One Trillion Trees initiative being launched here at the World Economic Forum.
[02:54:49.799 --> 02:54:50.820]  One Trillion Trees.
[02:54:54.437 --> 02:55:06.184]  Planting trees is good, of course, but it's nowhere near enough of what is needed, and it cannot replace real mitigation and rewilding nature.
[02:55:06.184 --> 02:55:13.528]  I think that some people are, they put it at a level that is, you know, unrealistic to a point you can't live your lives.
[02:55:13.528 --> 02:55:15.389]  We want to have the cleanest water on earth.
[02:55:15.389 --> 02:55:17.790]  We want to have the cleanest air on earth.
[02:55:17.790 --> 02:55:19.071]  Our numbers, as you saw, we had
[02:55:19.944 --> 02:55:22.325]  Record numbers come out very recently.
[02:55:22.325 --> 02:55:23.606]  Our numbers are very, very good.
[02:55:23.606 --> 02:55:31.030]  Our environmental numbers, our water numbers, our numbers on air are tremendous.
[02:55:31.030 --> 02:55:33.071]  We have to do something about other continents.
[02:55:33.071 --> 02:55:36.593]  We have to do something about other countries.
[02:55:36.593 --> 02:55:44.797]  It's all about other countries having no standards by design to deindustrialize us, but President Trump wasn't knowingly lying to you there at the end, in my view.
[02:55:45.933 --> 02:55:48.596]  Because what he told you on its face statistically is true.
[02:55:48.596 --> 02:56:04.073]  If China and India and 160 plus of the third world countries are way up here, thousands and thousands and thousands of times higher on the total output of chemicals and toxins compared to the US, one of the cleanest countries in the world.
[02:56:04.073 --> 02:56:06.836]  If they're way worse than us, he goes, hey, we're doing a lot better.
[02:56:08.735 --> 02:56:10.176]  Because we're not as high.
[02:56:10.176 --> 02:56:16.519]  But if you let higher levels come in, just because we're way better, it doesn't matter, Trump.
[02:56:16.519 --> 02:56:19.100]  President Trump.
[02:56:19.100 --> 02:56:20.861]  You don't want Barron taking those vaccines.
[02:56:20.861 --> 02:56:22.142]  You know what they did to him.
[02:56:22.142 --> 02:56:23.242]  You know they're tainted.
[02:56:23.242 --> 02:56:27.164]  Well, imagine what the atrocy is going to do to Barron's son or daughter.
[02:56:27.164 --> 02:56:27.965]  So this is serious.
[02:56:29.571 --> 02:56:30.792]  He's absolutely right.
[02:56:30.792 --> 02:56:33.694]  Why are all these other countries exempt but us and the West?
[02:56:33.694 --> 02:56:40.059]  Because it's a deindustrialization program openly run by the Rothschilds and their global carbon plan.
[02:56:40.059 --> 02:56:41.880]  We don't care about your parties!
[02:56:41.880 --> 02:56:43.961]  We don't care what group you're part of!
[02:56:43.961 --> 02:56:46.783]  Give us control of your energy and systems now!
[02:56:46.783 --> 02:56:49.105]  We are in control!
[02:56:49.105 --> 02:56:51.367]  And put that image of the poor African bush person
[02:56:52.901 --> 02:57:02.503]  Somewhere in North Africa, walking around with cracks in the ground, and she's saying she represents that poor African.
[02:57:02.503 --> 02:57:09.705]  But you see, low carbon dioxide levels is what have caused the Sahara Desert, more than anything, to expand in the last few thousand years.
[02:57:09.705 --> 02:57:18.147]  Higher CO2 levels make plants grow longer, stronger, better, up to five, six times, depending on the study, and with less water.
[02:57:20.137 --> 02:57:24.180]  And, of course, those bush folks have goats, which pull up the roots of plants.
[02:57:24.180 --> 02:57:25.481]  Cows don't eat the roots.
[02:57:25.481 --> 02:57:27.102]  So that's also causing this.
[02:57:27.102 --> 02:57:29.844]  That's all your fault, though, folks!
[02:57:29.844 --> 02:57:30.985]  Okay?
[02:57:30.985 --> 02:57:36.430]  So if you let Greta run your lives... By the way, electric cars use more fossil fuel than gas cars on average.
[02:57:36.430 --> 02:57:37.410]  It's all a scam!
[02:57:37.410 --> 02:57:40.112]  It's about the people she works for running our lives!
[02:57:40.112 --> 02:57:44.656]  Hour number four, straight ahead!
[02:57:44.656 --> 02:57:49.580]  I spend a lot of time reminding the InfoWars family of listeners and viewers
[02:57:50.888 --> 02:57:53.300]  That without you, we won't be on the air.
[02:57:53.300 --> 02:57:54.506]  And I spent a lot of time thanking you.
[02:57:55.319 --> 02:58:02.685]  But I really think you should thank yourself for keeping us on the air and really changing the world for the better and raising the alarm as modern Paul Revere's.
[02:58:02.685 --> 02:58:10.171]  But something I should spend more time on is just reminding you that these products are really amazing.
[02:58:10.171 --> 02:58:18.998]  You've got that pledge from me, but you've seen the third party test out there, the air filtration, the water filtration, the supplements are all the very best you're going to find out there.
[02:58:18.998 --> 02:58:23.542]  And you can't fund an operation anywhere else that's fighting the globalists.
[02:58:24.451 --> 02:58:25.072]  That's hard.
[02:58:25.072 --> 02:58:28.975]  So it's not a burden to support InfoWars.
[02:58:28.975 --> 02:58:39.605]  It really is something that is good for everybody that stands for justice and freedom and makes your life and your family's life and your children's life so much better.
[02:58:39.605 --> 02:58:42.268]  So visit InfoWarsStore.com today.
[02:58:44.815 --> 02:58:48.398]  InfoWars Life is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine.
[02:58:48.398 --> 02:58:50.179]  Introducing Pollen Block.
[02:58:50.179 --> 02:59:01.448]  We have found an extraordinary new, natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms, including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort, and respiratory function.
[02:59:02.228 --> 02:59:11.396]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs experienced less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses.
[02:59:11.396 --> 02:59:21.945]  They began studying this effect in published trials, and decades later, we now have the fruit of this research, a fast-acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms.
[02:59:22.465 --> 02:59:25.067]  Pollen block is natural and effective.
[02:59:25.067 --> 02:59:26.787]  It is not an antihistamine.
[02:59:26.787 --> 02:59:36.793]  In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of tryptase, which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.
[02:59:36.793 --> 02:59:39.434]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe.
[02:59:39.434 --> 02:59:47.838]  Head to Infowarslife.com and grab a pack of our Pollen Block Chewable Tablets.
[02:59:47.838 --> 02:59:50.520]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:04.620 --> 03:00:14.608]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, you're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:14.608 --> 03:00:18.951]  Ladies and gentlemen,
[03:00:30.407 --> 03:00:36.188]  I have an announcement to make here that is staggering.
[03:00:36.188 --> 03:00:39.249]  I was getting on the plane yesterday to fly back from D.C.
[03:00:39.249 --> 03:00:40.109]  to Austin, Texas.
[03:00:40.109 --> 03:00:44.870]  I read this Fox News article and it just hit me like a ton of bricks.
[03:00:44.870 --> 03:00:46.230]  My heart jumped.
[03:00:46.230 --> 03:00:47.631]  I followed the links.
[03:00:47.631 --> 03:00:48.651]  I sent it to the producer.
[03:00:48.651 --> 03:00:51.771]  It was on the top of my stack this morning.
[03:00:51.771 --> 03:00:57.333]  And then I got busy with all the other news and didn't make it the front and center story because there's just so much huge news.
[03:00:57.333 --> 03:00:58.933]  This is beyond gigantic.
[03:01:01.786 --> 03:01:26.660]  We've talked about California and Prop 65, they passed back in the 90s, that you have as much lead or another toxic substance in something you're selling as is in the air, and naturally occurring, you can be sued by lawyers, but that there are waivers by the state and the federal government for the fluoride they put in the water, because it's not just fluoride.
[03:01:26.660 --> 03:01:27.301]  This is on record.
[03:01:28.001 --> 03:01:35.267]  It's the toxic waste from the nuclear weapons production, aluminum production, and phosphate mining for fertilizers.
[03:01:35.267 --> 03:01:40.471]  So, under the name fluoride, in laws they passed in the late 40s, they can dump it in the water.
[03:01:40.471 --> 03:01:43.754]  Now scroll down and show them.
[03:01:43.754 --> 03:01:48.058]  They can dump it in the water.
[03:01:48.058 --> 03:01:52.101]  Call it fluoride, because it's been fluoridated.
[03:01:52.101 --> 03:01:56.805]  It adds the fluoride as an electromagnetic acid.
[03:01:58.342 --> 03:02:08.868]  To the toxic substance, and then by law they say now that it's been bound to fluoride, they can give it to you, which makes it even more deadly by calling it fluoride.
[03:02:08.868 --> 03:02:11.269]  Fluoridated chemicals.
[03:02:11.269 --> 03:02:14.971]  And if you look at most of the fluoride we get now, it's from China, with skull and crossbones on it.
[03:02:14.971 --> 03:02:19.134]  There's been big studies where they tested it on average and there were 300 chemicals on it.
[03:02:21.581 --> 03:02:26.124]  So I was rereading this article about to cover it from Fox News, and then I read it again.
[03:02:26.124 --> 03:02:27.544]  I went, oh my gosh, I should have covered this.
[03:02:27.544 --> 03:02:28.365]  There's our top story.
[03:02:28.365 --> 03:02:29.385]  Look at this.
[03:02:29.385 --> 03:02:34.428]  Americans exposed to toxic chemicals in drinking water, dramatically underestimated.
[03:02:34.428 --> 03:02:37.990]  110 million Americans are thought to be affected by it.
[03:02:37.990 --> 03:02:40.471]  It says it's causing all sorts of problems.
[03:02:40.471 --> 03:02:42.973]  Tap water in the United States is contaminated with toxic chemicals.
[03:02:43.936 --> 03:02:49.678]  Fluoridated chemicals at a higher rate than previously thought according to a report.
[03:02:49.678 --> 03:02:50.939]  Here's what I'm saying.
[03:02:50.939 --> 03:02:54.520]  They tell you all day we've got to keep the water safe to shut down U.S.
[03:02:54.520 --> 03:03:01.923]  industry while they're dumping toxic chemicals from all over the world under the name fluoride into the water.
[03:03:02.463 --> 03:03:06.546]  See, they're the guardians of the environment, then they're dumping poison in the water.
[03:03:06.546 --> 03:03:15.633]  Then giving themselves waivers, because all the water is poison, now we can't tell who else is dumping toxic waste in, because they're dumping hundreds of chemicals in, under the name fluoride.
[03:03:17.076 --> 03:03:26.000]  This is so big, so insane, so over the top, and then now everybody knows, because we've been warning them, you've been warning them, so other independent groups are testing, going, what the hell?
[03:03:26.000 --> 03:03:30.222]  And they go, oh, all these towns need billions in water cleaning to stop it.
[03:03:30.222 --> 03:03:32.222]  We don't know where it's all coming from.
[03:03:32.222 --> 03:03:35.504]  They're adding it in under the rubric.
[03:03:36.738 --> 03:03:39.879]  Under the name, the logo, fluoride.
[03:03:39.879 --> 03:03:43.199]  It's not calcium fluoride that you do need some for your teeth.
[03:03:43.199 --> 03:03:54.222]  It's hydrofluorosilicic electrified acid-based fluoride with toxic chemicals, Grignard reagents, going into the water on a mass scale.
[03:03:54.222 --> 03:04:00.263]  Mixed in with a nice sample of atrazine from all the runoff from the crops.
[03:04:00.263 --> 03:04:04.284]  And they're going, oh my god, we're testing it, there's fluoridated poison in everything!
[03:04:05.333 --> 03:04:09.516]  But nowhere do they say, because they dump it in there.
[03:04:09.516 --> 03:04:15.399]  It'd be like shooting your wife with a shotgun five times, blowing her guts, head, everywhere.
[03:04:15.399 --> 03:04:21.603]  And the cops get there and they test her and they go, it appears she's got lead poisoning.
[03:04:21.603 --> 03:04:23.124]  She died of lead poisoning.
[03:04:23.124 --> 03:04:24.205]  You're like, yeah, I know.
[03:04:24.205 --> 03:04:25.766]  Smoke's coming out of the barrel.
[03:04:25.766 --> 03:04:26.746]  They're putting it in.
[03:04:26.746 --> 03:04:28.067]  They're shooting us.
[03:04:28.067 --> 03:04:29.208]  They're attacking us.
[03:04:29.208 --> 03:04:30.549]  They're doing all of this.
[03:04:31.630 --> 03:04:35.792]  In our face, and then saying, oh my god, there's all these toxins in the water.
[03:04:35.792 --> 03:04:36.973]  You better filter your water.
[03:04:36.973 --> 03:04:40.334]  Yes, and we sell the very best unit out there to take it out to you and your family.
[03:04:40.334 --> 03:04:44.757]  The AlexaPure filtration system, 33% off at WoolworthsStore.com.
[03:04:44.757 --> 03:04:47.878]  This can fund our operation, help you and your family, a 360 win.
[03:04:47.878 --> 03:04:50.980]  But you're crazy if you don't start filtering your damn water.
[03:04:50.980 --> 03:04:51.460]  We'll be back.
[03:04:52.938 --> 03:05:03.027]  It is I, the leader of Cobra, here for a message to President Trump, the American people, and Alex Jones of InfoWars.
[03:05:03.027 --> 03:05:09.012]  Our operations with our partners, the Communist Chinese, have bought control of your media.
[03:05:09.012 --> 03:05:10.834]  But it's true.
[03:05:10.834 --> 03:05:14.016]  Your people are beginning to awaken.
[03:05:14.016 --> 03:05:16.959]  That's why Cobra is launching Operation
[03:05:17.039 --> 03:05:17.839]  We're good to go.
[03:05:35.782 --> 03:05:49.951]  You see, when you expose our false flags and fake media, I will carry out attacks and then blame you, like we've done with Alex Jones, blaming him for mass shootings we committed!
[03:05:49.951 --> 03:05:50.932]  Ha ha!
[03:05:50.932 --> 03:05:51.592]  Hail Cobra!
[03:06:03.360 --> 03:06:13.927]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[03:06:13.927 --> 03:06:26.196]  Ladies and gentlemen, Alex Jones here broadcasting worldwide, and I just got hit by a mega ton of bricks.
[03:06:27.876 --> 03:06:33.501]  Fox News is reporting that there's hundreds of horrible chemicals in the water in a big new U.S.
[03:06:33.501 --> 03:06:36.924]  government university report.
[03:06:36.924 --> 03:06:40.087]  Headline, Americans exposed to toxic chemicals in drinking water.
[03:06:40.087 --> 03:06:43.010]  Dramatically underestimated.
[03:06:43.010 --> 03:06:46.973]  New report says from all over the U.S.
[03:06:46.973 --> 03:06:51.077]  So I started reading the report itself and they say it's
[03:06:53.112 --> 03:06:55.874]  Fluorinated chemicals.
[03:06:55.874 --> 03:07:05.220]  Because under the rubric of adding fluoride to the water, it's a bunch of chemicals, hundreds of chemicals that are allowed to be with the fluoride.
[03:07:05.220 --> 03:07:12.424]  So, the world's discovering that our water's super toxic, but they're not saying where it's coming from.
[03:07:12.424 --> 03:07:13.485]  It'd be like Chernobyl.
[03:07:13.485 --> 03:07:15.346]  My God, everybody's down to radiation.
[03:07:15.346 --> 03:07:17.007]  It's thousands of times higher than it should be.
[03:07:17.007 --> 03:07:21.790]  And then saying,
[03:07:23.436 --> 03:07:24.597]  Oh, we have no idea what's doing it.
[03:07:24.597 --> 03:07:30.100]  There's a smoking reactor a half mile away.
[03:07:30.100 --> 03:07:33.182]  But see, they're slowly covering their ass now.
[03:07:33.182 --> 03:07:41.148]  Oh, there's fluoride, fluoridated chemicals.
[03:07:41.148 --> 03:07:48.012]  Unbelievable.
[03:07:48.012 --> 03:07:51.795]  Now, Millie Weaver is going to be coming up, folks, from the Capitol.
[03:07:53.141 --> 03:08:01.587]  And then we've got Mike Adams taking over here in just a few minutes.
[03:08:01.587 --> 03:08:05.390]  The trial is going on right now of the president.
[03:08:05.390 --> 03:08:17.299]  We're going to get a report from her.
[03:08:17.299 --> 03:08:19.621]  But I've just got to tell you right now.
[03:08:24.773 --> 03:08:37.436]  Do you understand, ladies and gentlemen, that there's some type of mind game or a mind control going on here that is absolutely unbelievable?
[03:08:37.436 --> 03:08:43.737]  Where, at the end of World War II, they have the Nuremberg Trials in Germany.
[03:08:47.512 --> 03:09:04.342]  The Nazi gun control and the Weimar Republic before that gun control plan comes out in the hearings and Senator Dodd, not the current Senator Dodd of recent history, the other Senator Dodd, he goes and translates it, it only changes like five words in it, and that becomes the 1968 Gun Control Act.
[03:09:04.342 --> 03:09:07.403]  And the Nazi rocket program became our NASA program.
[03:09:07.403 --> 03:09:09.825]  I mean, we adopted a lot of the Nazi stuff.
[03:09:09.825 --> 03:09:11.526]  The autobahn became our highways.
[03:09:13.848 --> 03:09:19.732]  But the Nazis learned from Stalin, this is in Pulitzer Prize winning books from World War II, okay?
[03:09:19.732 --> 03:09:22.513]  I mean, you can go read these.
[03:09:22.513 --> 03:09:29.557]  That if you put a certain amount of hydrofluorosilicic acid in the water, it makes people docile and dumb.
[03:09:29.557 --> 03:09:31.979]  Now all the studies are out now proving that.
[03:09:31.979 --> 03:09:38.403]  But there's a big report come out, government report, Fox News, that oh my God, there's all this toxic waste in the water.
[03:09:38.403 --> 03:09:41.725]  It's fluoridated
[03:09:43.473 --> 03:09:43.993]  Chemicals!
[03:09:43.993 --> 03:09:45.134]  What does that mean?
[03:09:45.134 --> 03:09:47.775]  It means you add an acid.
[03:09:47.775 --> 03:09:52.297]  Hydrofluorosilicic acid is in the top five most deadly acids in the world.
[03:09:52.297 --> 03:09:58.059]  It'll eat through things like the alien blood in Alien.
[03:09:58.059 --> 03:10:01.180]  It's deadly.
[03:10:01.180 --> 03:10:04.942]  And anything, any other chemicals you add with it, it's an adjuvant in the body.
[03:10:04.942 --> 03:10:05.942]  It makes them worse.
[03:10:05.942 --> 03:10:07.142]  It magnifies them.
[03:10:07.142 --> 03:10:08.363]  It amplifies them.
[03:10:08.363 --> 03:10:10.804]  It increases them massively.
[03:10:12.375 --> 03:10:14.336]  Incredibly massively.
[03:10:14.336 --> 03:10:19.559]  And I keep saying, how are they going after some company with a little bit of toxic stuff because of the water on accident?
[03:10:19.559 --> 03:10:34.166]  They go to prison, but the government adds fluoridated hydrofluorosilic acid chemicals in, and then now there's a big report out, Fox News reporting on it, it's all over the news, saying it's fluoridated fluoride chemicals!
[03:10:34.166 --> 03:10:39.929]  Holy mackerel, Toledo!
[03:10:39.929 --> 03:10:41.290]  Get it out, man!
[03:10:41.290 --> 03:10:41.770]  Stop it!
[03:10:43.715 --> 03:10:51.299]  But instead they're like, we don't know where it's coming from, we need billions of dollars in cleaning systems here to cut it out of wherever it's coming from.
[03:10:51.299 --> 03:10:56.442]  They add it at the water treatment plant!
[03:10:56.442 --> 03:11:02.425]  And they're building new facilities all over the country to find out where the toxins are coming from when they're adding it at the chemical plant.
[03:11:03.459 --> 03:11:05.861]  It's like you took a gun to your head and went, pfft, roll your head off.
[03:11:05.861 --> 03:11:10.325]  Somebody goes, let's find out why it's happening, pfft, we don't know why it's happening.
[03:11:10.325 --> 03:11:15.649]  It's unbelievable, because no one can admit.
[03:11:15.649 --> 03:11:23.835]  No one knows why there's all the chemicals, because if you admit it, you'll find out about the whole conspiracy.
[03:11:23.835 --> 03:11:26.938]  Which Joseph Stalin was doing with V.I.
[03:11:26.938 --> 03:11:29.140]  Lenin to the Russians and others.
[03:11:33.965 --> 03:11:35.346]  It's roach poison, folks.
[03:11:35.346 --> 03:11:38.569]  That's all hydrofluorosilicic acid is.
[03:11:38.569 --> 03:11:45.015]  Roaches run across it and they die about a week later.
[03:11:45.015 --> 03:11:46.777]  Or the minute they start licking it off their feet.
[03:11:52.145 --> 03:11:53.647]  Millie Weaver joins us.
[03:11:53.647 --> 03:11:56.690]  She's just now getting set up there live at the Capitol.
[03:11:56.690 --> 03:11:57.691]  Appreciate her joining us.
[03:11:57.691 --> 03:12:02.515]  Just hot off Virginia and the amazing report she filed there with her team and now there at the Capitol.
[03:12:02.515 --> 03:12:04.798]  I know, breaking a lot of huge news.
[03:12:04.798 --> 03:12:05.198]  So much.
[03:12:05.198 --> 03:12:08.481]  I'll just ask her, what's the latest Millie?
[03:12:08.481 --> 03:12:09.783]  Well, I'm just out here.
[03:12:09.783 --> 03:12:12.706]  There was just a press conference outside the U.S.
[03:12:12.706 --> 03:12:13.787]  Capitol here in D.C.
[03:12:14.491 --> 03:12:24.793]  Several attorney generals from various states, from South Carolina, Indiana, Louisiana, they've come out today in opposition of this impeachment sham.
[03:12:24.793 --> 03:12:37.216]  They said that they believe that this whole thing is corrupt, it's a sham, it is uncalled for, and that essentially they don't believe that this impeachment is actually going to go through in the Senate.
[03:12:37.216 --> 03:12:43.497]  They don't think that Trump's going to be impeached based on the evidence or lack of evidence that they've seen so far.
[03:12:44.315 --> 03:12:50.279]  So they're making a statement out here today, Alex.
[03:12:50.279 --> 03:12:52.480]  What's the feeling there on Capitol Hill?
[03:12:52.480 --> 03:12:55.062]  What's the vibe?
[03:12:55.062 --> 03:12:59.325]  Well, you know, there were some anti-Trump protests planned for today.
[03:12:59.325 --> 03:13:03.327]  And I'll tell you what, Alex, they were really small.
[03:13:03.327 --> 03:13:05.809]  These protests are dwindling in size.
[03:13:05.809 --> 03:13:09.411]  The anti-Trump protests just keep shrinking smaller and smaller.
[03:13:09.775 --> 03:13:19.199]  And it's probably because of how booming the economy is, how great we're doing with jobs, the fact that 4 million people have been lifted from food stamps.
[03:13:19.199 --> 03:13:37.786]  America's doing really good, and Trump's helping with that, and it just seems like these protests are- Well, Amelia, I agree, but I also think, as we've been lied to so much by the deep state, everyone's sick of Adam Schiff, but they just- and Nadler, and Crypt Keeper, they just can't stop, though, because they just think they rule everything in their own little delusional Hitler bunkers.
[03:13:38.962 --> 03:13:39.662]  Oh exactly!
[03:13:39.662 --> 03:13:55.172]  And earlier there was a small group of protesters and Will Johnson, I ran into him and a bunch of other conservative reporters and we were trying to ask them questions but they just said that we're fascists and they tried to tell us we couldn't be near their protests.
[03:13:55.172 --> 03:13:56.292]  The same old, same old.
[03:13:56.292 --> 03:13:59.534]  They said, oh we don't want you here, you're not allowed here.
[03:13:59.534 --> 03:14:01.375]  They ended up running off and leaving.
[03:14:01.375 --> 03:14:03.417]  I guess they were afraid.
[03:14:03.417 --> 03:14:07.479]  They said they were afraid because we're fascists and they didn't like us asking questions but
[03:14:07.915 --> 03:14:10.658]  That is what we're dealing with out here.
[03:14:10.658 --> 03:14:22.490]  I'm expecting that the protests are small now, but as soon as the Senate decides to shoot down this impeachment sham, I think that we're going to see a lot more protests out here later in the week, Alex.
[03:14:23.257 --> 03:14:31.826]  Well, you're going to be there covering it all live, Millie, and Mike Adams is about to take over, but I wanted to get your take on the Virginia situation for a few minutes when we come back.
[03:14:31.826 --> 03:14:32.827]  But start getting into that.
[03:14:32.827 --> 03:14:38.793]  I mean, you've filed so many just incredible reports that are at Band.Video and also on your YouTube channel.
[03:14:38.793 --> 03:14:41.916]  I mean, just give me a snapshot of what the Virginia rally was like.
[03:14:43.010 --> 03:14:44.951]  Okay, the Virginia rally was amazing.
[03:14:44.951 --> 03:14:47.192]  I've never seen anything like it before, Alex.
[03:14:47.192 --> 03:14:55.075]  So many citizens out there caring openly in defiance of the governor and the Democrats who want to take away their guns.
[03:14:55.075 --> 03:15:03.538]  They had a gated off area where they wanted the protesters to go, an anti-gun zone, a gun-free zone, so to speak.
[03:15:03.538 --> 03:15:08.400]  But what was funny and the irony is that everyone was mostly staying outside of that area.
[03:15:08.400 --> 03:15:12.482]  There were a small group of people in the area, but way more people on the streets.
[03:15:12.878 --> 03:15:17.680]  You had truckers going through the streets honking their horns, jaybreaking.
[03:15:17.680 --> 03:15:25.002]  You just had absolute, the spirit of rebellion and defiance against tyrannical people trying to take away their rights.
[03:15:25.002 --> 03:15:26.282]  That's what we saw in Virginia.
[03:15:26.282 --> 03:15:29.363]  Well, Millie, I know you're following a bunch of reports, but I want to hear more from you.
[03:15:29.363 --> 03:15:33.644]  I hope you'll join us for a couple segments tomorrow, and I hope you can come on the War Room today.
[03:15:33.644 --> 03:15:37.086]  They're going to be hosted from the road as well, but we just want to hear from you.
[03:15:37.086 --> 03:15:38.046]  That's Millennium Millie.
[03:15:38.046 --> 03:15:39.026]  Thank you so much.
[03:15:39.026 --> 03:15:40.987]  I'll talk to you today or tomorrow.
[03:15:40.987 --> 03:15:41.387]  Amazing.
[03:15:41.707 --> 03:15:46.818]  Coming up, Mike Adams is about to take over, but I got one more thing I want to say, and then I'll throw the baton to Mike Adams.
[03:15:46.818 --> 03:15:47.520]  Stay with us.
[03:15:47.520 --> 03:15:47.840]  Thank you, Mike.
[03:15:52.005 --> 03:15:53.225]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.
[03:15:53.225 --> 03:15:57.146]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[03:15:57.146 --> 03:15:58.686]  I sued the IRS and won.
[03:15:58.686 --> 03:16:01.647]  I beat the IRS then, and I've been beating them ever since.
[03:16:01.647 --> 03:16:07.208]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement, and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved.
[03:16:07.208 --> 03:16:08.408]  I can help you, too.
[03:16:08.408 --> 03:16:11.349]  If you owe taxes you can't pay, don't wait another day.
[03:16:11.349 --> 03:16:13.569]  There's no such thing as a hopeless tax case.
[03:16:13.569 --> 03:16:18.010]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX or go to my website, danpilla.com.
[03:16:18.010 --> 03:16:20.311]  That's danpilla.com, danpilla.com.
[03:16:21.900 --> 03:16:23.160]  Maybe not today.
[03:16:23.160 --> 03:16:24.461]  Maybe not tomorrow.
[03:16:24.461 --> 03:16:28.202]  But soon, you'll need a plan and place to survive.
[03:16:28.202 --> 03:16:29.262]  Forget bunkers.
[03:16:29.262 --> 03:16:31.103]  You're not a live underground gopher.
[03:16:31.103 --> 03:16:32.803]  You need Survivalist Camps.

[03:17:55.074 --> 03:17:57.295]  InfoWarsLife.com.
[03:17:57.295 --> 03:17:59.316]  InfoWarsLife.com.
[03:17:59.316 --> 03:18:08.581]  You go to that URL, it takes you to the subsection of InfoWarsTore.com where you find the 60 plus products where we've gone out and researched what is the best,
[03:18:09.301 --> 03:18:10.982]  So it gives people the best results.
[03:18:10.982 --> 03:18:14.705]  We either private label it or we develop our own with top developers.
[03:18:14.705 --> 03:18:19.568]  And folks, I'm telling you, you can see the difference in me, my energy, my focus.
[03:18:19.568 --> 03:18:22.470]  I've lost almost 40 pounds in less than four months.
[03:18:22.470 --> 03:18:23.391]  It's incredible.
[03:18:23.391 --> 03:18:25.052]  So do yourself a favor.
[03:18:25.052 --> 03:18:27.534]  Try out the products if you've been on the fence.
[03:18:27.534 --> 03:18:30.416]  You can't lose except if you don't take action.
[03:18:30.416 --> 03:18:37.381]  Because when you buy the products, you're funding the operation that is always delivering thanks to your support and God's grace and our action.
[03:18:37.941 --> 03:18:39.961]  There's a lot of phony garbage out there in the world.
[03:18:39.961 --> 03:18:41.322]  A lot of people that never deliver.
[03:18:41.322 --> 03:18:42.882]  Well, I'm here to tell you, InfoWars has delivered in
[03:19:04.478 --> 03:19:11.762]  A handful of ace of spades because of God, because of the audience of activists, and because of the great team at M4 Wars.
[03:19:11.762 --> 03:19:15.124]  And we are all a team, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:19:15.124 --> 03:19:19.027]  So right now, humanity is awakening, it's explosive, it's powerful, it's incredible.
[03:19:19.807 --> 03:19:29.158]  But there's major obstacles coming down the road, and the only way we can effectively fight the NWO and stay in the game on Jim Folwar's Citizenship of the Spirit is your financial support.
[03:19:29.158 --> 03:19:32.162]  We make it really easy at infolwarrestore.com.
[03:19:32.162 --> 03:19:36.647]  But I am blowing through our backup money right now with our report
[03:19:36.667 --> 03:19:37.968]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[03:20:21.752 --> 03:20:29.675]  We are back live, ladies and gentlemen, and Mike Adams is taking over, but he was just telling us off-air he'd like to continue talking about the big fluoride mess.
[03:20:29.675 --> 03:20:34.257]  The magnitude of this is really hard to even describe.
[03:20:34.257 --> 03:20:51.023]  We learned a few weeks ago that the UN had a meeting in December, the official UN head scientist, and that they admitted that vaccines were killing people, that they were covering it up, and that Big Pharma was not testing it.
[03:20:53.479 --> 03:20:56.820]  Other than NaturalNews.com and Infowars.com, only a handful of sites covered it.
[03:20:56.820 --> 03:21:06.704]  Yeah, we probably got a million and a half views total on the reports we did on our own platform, but you'd think that'd be important.
[03:21:06.704 --> 03:21:09.865]  Well, now this is even more insane.
[03:21:09.865 --> 03:21:13.826]  I'm at the airport flying back from D.C.
[03:21:13.826 --> 03:21:17.127]  I'm just on FoxNews.com.
[03:21:17.127 --> 03:21:21.629]  Americans exposed to toxic chemicals and drinking water, dramatically underestimated report.
[03:21:23.251 --> 03:21:33.156]  They go on to say they don't know where it's coming from, but there's toxic, fluoridated chemicals at much higher rates, at deadly levels, affecting at least 110 million Americans.
[03:21:36.564 --> 03:21:44.752]  And it goes into these forever chemicals that they can't get rid of because it's bound in with the acid-based fluoride, which they have waivers.
[03:21:44.752 --> 03:21:52.460]  It's how they add the chemical toxic waste to the water, calling it fluoridated, because what they do is they fluoridate with this acid, toxic chemicals.
[03:21:52.460 --> 03:21:58.326]  It dissolves into it, and then they call it fluoride, and then Congress passed a law so they could do this.
[03:21:59.537 --> 03:22:09.384]  And Stanley Kubrick made jokes about it with Dr. Strangelove, because people got up in arms saying, it's a communist plot to put it in the water to make us dumb and make us infertile, because the Soviets had done that!
[03:22:09.384 --> 03:22:12.306]  They'd done it to the Russians!
[03:22:12.306 --> 03:22:14.668]  That's in history books!
[03:22:14.668 --> 03:22:15.888]  But now look at the public.
[03:22:15.888 --> 03:22:22.853]  Massive infertility, massive low sperm counts, incredibly low IQs, and Harvard admits it's the fluoride.
[03:22:22.853 --> 03:22:27.877]  But now to have big studies out going, we don't know where this chemical's coming from when they're adding it there.
[03:22:29.206 --> 03:22:35.211]  It'd be like somebody coming to your house with a meat cleaver and hacking your family and going, I don't know who's got this meat cleaver killing people.
[03:22:35.211 --> 03:22:40.715]  Or I went to the lake with cyanide, hypothetically, and was like, right in front of the police going, somebody's putting cyanide in the water.
[03:22:40.715 --> 03:22:41.536]  I did a test the other day.
[03:22:41.536 --> 03:22:43.197]  Look, officers, they're like, yeah, it's you.
[03:22:43.197 --> 03:22:43.958]  Put you in handcuffs.
[03:22:46.858 --> 03:22:47.659]  Wow!
[03:22:47.659 --> 03:22:59.065]  So yes, I was already planning a big push because Tucker Carlson last week talked about atrocy in most of the water and how the EPA is saying they can raise the level or not even test for it, even though it admittedly does all these horrible things.
[03:22:59.065 --> 03:23:04.869]  And then I'm reading this, and yes, 33% off Alexa Pure Breeze, high quality, gravity-fed filtration system.
[03:23:04.869 --> 03:23:06.010]  It funds our operation.
[03:23:06.010 --> 03:23:07.671]  Everybody should get it.
[03:23:07.671 --> 03:23:11.793]  But if everybody just filtered their water, if all the listeners got this, we'd have money to hire 500 reporters.
[03:23:13.234 --> 03:23:17.015]  We'd be bigger than Fox News, but a handful get it.
[03:23:17.015 --> 03:23:17.915]  It's more than a pitch.
[03:23:17.915 --> 03:23:22.457]  It's imperative that you get a filtered system like this that cuts all the garbage out.
[03:23:22.457 --> 03:23:23.777]  Other systems don't do it.
[03:23:23.777 --> 03:23:26.898]  Infoworkstore.com, I'm done talking about it.
[03:23:26.898 --> 03:23:29.979]  Fish Oil's about to sell out at 33% off.
[03:23:29.979 --> 03:23:30.979]  It's there.
[03:23:30.979 --> 03:23:31.880]  X2's back in stock.
[03:23:31.880 --> 03:23:35.121]  The good halogen that's so good for your body, pure iodine.
[03:23:35.121 --> 03:23:39.162]  So the bad halogen family, fluoride, bromine, all of that.
[03:23:39.162 --> 03:23:40.982]  So Mike Adams takes over.
[03:23:40.982 --> 03:23:42.283]  Naturalnews.com, but
[03:23:43.183 --> 03:23:49.187]  The way they hide this in plain view, because this article was in a local paper too, a similar one about, oh, it's super toxic.
[03:23:49.187 --> 03:23:51.669]  Where's all this fluoridated chemicals coming from?
[03:23:51.669 --> 03:23:54.491]  It's the fluoride, has the chemicals in it.
[03:23:54.491 --> 03:23:55.331]  Explain it to people.
[03:23:55.331 --> 03:23:56.512]  You're a real expert.
[03:23:56.512 --> 03:23:59.274]  You've got one of the biggest toxicology labs in the country.
[03:23:59.274 --> 03:24:00.135]  You're an engineer.
[03:24:00.135 --> 03:24:02.476]  You're one of the leading experts on this.
[03:24:02.476 --> 03:24:04.878]  What do you make of them trying to hide this in plain view?
[03:24:04.878 --> 03:24:05.979]  What the hell is this?
[03:24:06.499 --> 03:24:07.480]  We've got a big problem.
[03:24:07.480 --> 03:24:09.962]  We need billion-dollar scrubbers to cut out.
[03:24:09.962 --> 03:24:11.464]  We don't know where the poison's coming from.
[03:24:11.464 --> 03:24:15.468]  We've got all these deadly grignard reagents, heavy metals that have been fluoridated.
[03:24:15.468 --> 03:24:16.709]  Where's it coming from, Mike?
[03:24:17.697 --> 03:24:26.939]  So the bombshell headline for the day is Alex Jones knows more about environmental pollution than all the environmentalist people and groups out there.
[03:24:26.939 --> 03:24:29.920]  I mean, you are talking about the issues that they ignore.
[03:24:29.920 --> 03:24:31.641]  They talk about fake issues.
[03:24:31.641 --> 03:24:35.942]  They say carbon dioxide is bad, but they ignore the heavy metals that are in the fluoride.
[03:24:35.942 --> 03:24:38.202]  I've got big news to add to what you just said.
[03:24:38.202 --> 03:24:40.763]  I mean, you nailed it, Alex, in your previous segment as well.
[03:24:40.763 --> 03:24:41.143]  You nailed it.
[03:24:41.583 --> 03:24:43.204]  But it's even bigger than this.
[03:24:43.204 --> 03:24:51.948]  It's not just that they can put toxic heavy metals and toxic chemicals in with fluoride, and when they mix it together, it becomes, quote, fluoride.
[03:24:51.948 --> 03:24:54.030]  Now, it's no longer a toxin.
[03:24:54.030 --> 03:24:55.871]  Now it's fluoride.
[03:24:55.871 --> 03:24:57.331]  And then they drip it into the water supply.
[03:24:57.331 --> 03:24:58.452]  Yes, you're right about that.
[03:24:58.992 --> 03:25:02.195]  But, they also do it with bio-sludge.
[03:25:02.195 --> 03:25:06.058]  So they can take any toxin and flush it down the city's sewers.
[03:25:06.058 --> 03:25:07.579]  Flush it down the drain.
[03:25:07.579 --> 03:25:14.284]  And then that gets turned into nitrogen fertilizer that's dumped on nearby farms and school parks.
[03:25:14.284 --> 03:25:15.465]  And it's all about labeling.
[03:25:15.465 --> 03:25:17.686]  I want to say how smart, and I want you to spend the whole thing on this.
[03:25:17.686 --> 03:25:20.188]  I apologize to you up at the end, but this is so incredible.
[03:25:20.188 --> 03:25:23.831]  Art Jeboperator, who's worked at Big TV all over the country, he's super smart.
[03:25:23.831 --> 03:25:24.912]  He needs a show.
[03:25:24.912 --> 03:25:27.234]  He was saying, Alex, that's important.
[03:25:28.686 --> 03:25:32.349]  And some other folks in the hall were saying, but it's the sewage, Alex.
[03:25:32.349 --> 03:25:36.053]  It's the sewage with the drugs and the chemicals and then you just said it.
[03:25:36.053 --> 03:25:43.079]  They name it bio-sludge, but really all it is is the incredibly toxic stuff from the sewage plants and then they feed it to us again, Mike!
[03:25:43.079 --> 03:25:44.301]  It's all on purpose!
[03:25:44.301 --> 03:25:45.181]  Holy Toledo!
[03:25:45.181 --> 03:25:46.383]  I'm sorry, take over, Mike!
[03:25:47.063 --> 03:25:48.545]  Multiple vectors of poison.
[03:25:48.545 --> 03:25:49.345]  It's all deliberate.
[03:25:49.345 --> 03:25:50.666]  And I'm not even done yet.
[03:25:50.666 --> 03:25:58.514]  It's also... So they take toxic drug runoff sludge and feed it to us and they admit that it's making the shrimp and fish kill themselves.
[03:25:59.394 --> 03:26:05.620]  Well right, there's birth control drugs now in the fertilizer that goes on your food, on the farms.
[03:26:05.620 --> 03:26:16.470]  And used, I'm sorry to be explicit here, but feminine hygiene products that get flushed down sewage, they are found littered all over these farm fields where they dump the bio-sludge from cities.
[03:26:16.470 --> 03:26:19.373]  And all the speed, and all the, just, oh my god.
[03:26:20.410 --> 03:26:22.291]  Yep, and guess what else?
[03:26:22.291 --> 03:26:34.760]  They can take anything, according to laws of Congress passed in the 1980s, they can take anything and put it into a vaccine, and call it a vaccine, and the vaccine manufacturers are completely immune to any lawsuits.
[03:26:34.760 --> 03:26:40.103]  Wow, you know my dad first told me about this when I was like 10 at the hardware store.
[03:26:41.224 --> 03:26:52.407]  And he said, son, you know under laws they're allowed to take toxic waste and put it in fertilizer, but it's not supposedly for crops, but everybody uses it because it's 10% the cost.
[03:26:52.407 --> 03:26:55.168]  He says, you see how that says that right there?
[03:26:55.168 --> 03:27:02.170]  And he showed me how it said not for crops that humans are going to be eating from.
[03:27:02.170 --> 03:27:04.390]  But that's where they put the toxic waste.
[03:27:04.390 --> 03:27:05.251]  This is so incredible.
[03:27:05.251 --> 03:27:06.071]  Mike, I'm sorry, take over.
[03:27:07.099 --> 03:27:08.021]  Well, it's interesting.
[03:27:08.021 --> 03:27:14.712]  From a government regulation standpoint, you know, we have a Clean Water Act, which, of course, the fluoride has an exception to that.
[03:27:14.712 --> 03:27:16.935]  You know, they're given waivers like you covered.
[03:27:16.935 --> 03:27:18.298]  We have a Clean Air Act.
[03:27:19.048 --> 03:27:21.250]  But we don't have a Clean Soils Act.
[03:27:21.250 --> 03:27:25.073]  And so soils is where a lot of this pollution goes because there's no law against it.
[03:27:25.073 --> 03:27:31.238]  They can literally take toxic heavy metals, even radioactive waste, biohazard waste, you know, hospitals.
[03:27:31.238 --> 03:27:35.841]  And we wonder why when you drive through dusty weather you think it's pollen making you sick.
[03:27:35.841 --> 03:27:37.603]  No, it's the toxic clouds.
[03:27:38.519 --> 03:27:39.159]  Right, that's right.
[03:27:39.159 --> 03:27:44.162]  And then, add on top of this, the 5G electromagnetic radiation pollution.
[03:27:44.162 --> 03:27:46.563]  So, you see, it is an assault.
[03:27:46.563 --> 03:27:53.246]  And I'm going to talk about the coronavirus bioengineered weapons system also in an upcoming segment here on your show, Alex.
[03:27:53.246 --> 03:27:57.848]  But these are multiple vectors of weapons systems that are targeting humanity.
[03:27:57.848 --> 03:27:59.209]  In fact, Mike, this is so important.
[03:27:59.209 --> 03:28:02.290]  Can you come on early in the show tomorrow and get into coronaviruses?
[03:28:02.290 --> 03:28:03.511]  I know you're on the cutting edge of that.
[03:28:03.931 --> 03:28:09.757]  And the bio-sludge and this huge fluoride development where they're now hiding it in plain view because this is just incredible.
[03:28:09.757 --> 03:28:11.018]  Because again, the alchemy.
[03:28:11.018 --> 03:28:13.100]  They call toxic waste fluoride.
[03:28:13.100 --> 03:28:16.864]  They call toxic sewage bio-sludge.
[03:28:16.864 --> 03:28:23.170]  I mean, it's all a legalese game where they change the name, the lobbyist, they get Congress to pass it.
[03:28:23.170 --> 03:28:24.792]  Like, oh, I can drink glasses of Roundup.
[03:28:24.792 --> 03:28:25.653]  Here, drink it, lobbyist.
[03:28:25.653 --> 03:28:26.354]  I'm not about to die.
[03:28:27.145 --> 03:28:27.585]  You see?
[03:28:27.585 --> 03:28:36.629]  And it's not only... They're now putting... They've legalized it in Washington State to put decomposed human beings into the bio-sludge which goes into the food crops.
[03:28:36.629 --> 03:28:40.510]  So this is, you know, full-on Soylent Green now emerging in our society.
[03:28:40.510 --> 03:28:41.510]  Full-on Soylent Green.
[03:28:41.510 --> 03:28:42.731]  That was the last point.
[03:28:42.731 --> 03:28:46.332]  It's all the liberal areas that love the bio-sludge.
[03:28:46.332 --> 03:28:47.973]  Total anti-environmentalist.
[03:28:47.973 --> 03:28:49.093]  Total anti.
[03:28:49.093 --> 03:28:50.214]  It's a version of reality.
[03:28:52.182 --> 03:28:55.204]  We can all agree these are troubled times, right?
[03:28:55.204 --> 03:28:58.106]  So do you know who's on your wireless network?
[03:28:58.106 --> 03:29:05.330]  Whether it's a big company selling your data, or a foreign hacker, if you're not protected, everybody sees your information.

[03:30:53.786 --> 03:30:59.349]  25 years ago when I first began broadcasting, I was a realist and I was honest with the listeners.
[03:30:59.349 --> 03:31:01.250]  America was in a coma.
[03:31:01.250 --> 03:31:05.712]  We were being absolutely poisoned physically, culturally, and spiritually.
[03:31:05.712 --> 03:31:10.655]  The New World Order was running rampant because the public was asleep.
[03:31:10.655 --> 03:31:19.519]  Fast forward to this year, in 2020, and to see Soros spend over $100 million on the Women's March here in D.C.
[03:31:19.519 --> 03:31:21.760]  and in Los Angeles, and they might have had 30,000 people.
[03:31:23.101 --> 03:31:24.262]  Maybe.
[03:31:24.262 --> 03:31:26.404]  They had five million three years ago.
[03:31:26.404 --> 03:31:28.145]  Ladies and gentlemen, I was here.
[03:31:28.145 --> 03:31:37.093]  That is emblematic of how his money and Chi-Com money cannot buy them the AstroTurf anymore.
[03:31:37.093 --> 03:31:39.956]  So, yes, the awakenings happened, but we're not out of the woods.
[03:31:39.956 --> 03:31:47.442]  The globalists are going to throw a bunch of Hail Marys during this Trump Senate trial, and we're going to be covering it live from D.C.
[03:31:47.442 --> 03:31:48.863]  at Band.Video.
[03:31:48.863 --> 03:31:50.445]  Please be Paul Revere and share this link.
[03:31:52.383 --> 03:31:54.564]  Hey, you there.
[03:31:54.564 --> 03:31:56.304]  We have a problem.
[03:31:56.304 --> 03:31:59.105]  You see, there is a baby.
[03:31:59.105 --> 03:32:02.986]  The mother of this baby is not sure she's ready.
[03:32:02.986 --> 03:32:07.107]  The father of this baby doesn't want to settle down.
[03:32:07.107 --> 03:32:09.887]  The mother starts to have regrets.
[03:32:09.887 --> 03:32:13.648]  The father considers leaving town.
[03:32:13.648 --> 03:32:16.989]  But a friend says there's a solution.
[03:32:16.989 --> 03:32:19.950]  She says to have an abortion.
[03:32:21.138 --> 03:32:23.039]  The mother decides to look into it.
[03:32:23.039 --> 03:32:26.101]  The clinic assures her it's safe.
[03:32:26.101 --> 03:32:27.902]  She's made her decision.
[03:32:27.902 --> 03:32:30.403]  She's going to have an abortion.
[03:32:30.403 --> 03:32:33.625]  The problem is, that baby is you.
[03:32:36.676 --> 03:32:45.681]  Join me, Owen Schroyer, at the March for Life, Friday, January 24th, in Washington, D.C., noon, at the National Mall.
[03:32:45.681 --> 03:32:46.842]  I'll see you there.
[03:32:46.842 --> 03:32:49.283]  It's time to stand up for the unborn.
[03:32:49.283 --> 03:32:55.826]  It's time to speak out for the voiceless.
[03:32:55.826 --> 03:32:58.468]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:06.371 --> 03:33:08.779]  Waging War on Corruption.
[03:33:08.779 --> 03:33:12.672]  It's Alex Jones with Mike Adams.
[03:33:17.099 --> 03:33:21.064]  Mike Adams chiming in here for the remainder of the fourth hour on the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:21.064 --> 03:33:23.226]  Thank you for joining me.
[03:33:23.226 --> 03:33:25.229]  And just real quick, just kind of a programming note.
[03:33:25.229 --> 03:33:29.954]  I've had a lot of people calling and texting me concerned about the cyber attack on Natural News.
[03:33:29.954 --> 03:33:31.756]  Our website is frozen.
[03:33:31.756 --> 03:33:33.538]  We are unable to post news stories.
[03:33:33.538 --> 03:33:37.103]  We have been subjected to a very sophisticated cyber attack.
[03:33:37.903 --> 03:33:41.044]  That has put us into an emergency mode.
[03:33:41.044 --> 03:33:42.665]  Previous stories are available.
[03:33:42.665 --> 03:33:44.405]  We've lost some stories.
[03:33:44.405 --> 03:33:51.628]  Basically, we've been locked out of our own data, not for any technical reason, but for a social engineering reason.
[03:33:51.628 --> 03:33:54.269]  I'll bring you more details as that unfolds.
[03:33:54.269 --> 03:33:55.809]  We're working to solve the problem.
[03:33:55.809 --> 03:33:58.110]  We appreciate your prayers and your support.
[03:33:58.110 --> 03:34:00.091]  We're working with attorneys as well.
[03:34:00.091 --> 03:34:06.953]  But what we believe has happened, just to summarize it, is we believe that a cyber warfare group has impersonated
[03:34:07.413 --> 03:34:15.476]  Federal agents to force our hosting provider to disconnect our data servers.
[03:34:15.476 --> 03:34:16.716]  And that's that's a bombshell.
[03:34:16.716 --> 03:34:20.038]  It's not 100% confirmed, but it's pointing in that direction.
[03:34:20.038 --> 03:34:32.522]  At first, I thought maybe it was the FBI trying to shut us down because we were reporting on the FBI running the white supremacist groups that were associated with Governor Northam's emergency order in Virginia.
[03:34:33.234 --> 03:34:46.158]  But now, based on the evidence I'm seeing, it appears to be a cyber warfare group, perhaps outside the United States, that is impersonating agents of the federal government that is engaged in this.
[03:34:46.158 --> 03:34:50.040]  And clearly they have spent millions of dollars to try to take us down.
[03:34:50.040 --> 03:34:53.661]  They haven't taken us offline, but they have interrupted our news publishing.
[03:34:53.661 --> 03:34:57.702]  So there will be no news from Natural News for the next day or two, maybe three.
[03:34:57.702 --> 03:34:59.183]  I don't know how long this is going to take.
[03:34:59.750 --> 03:35:03.031]  But I appreciate your patience and I appreciate your support.
[03:35:03.031 --> 03:35:09.732]  Now getting to what Alex and I were just talking about in the previous segment, and by the way, just thank God for InfoWars, right?
[03:35:09.732 --> 03:35:12.292]  Thank God that we have multiple platforms.
[03:35:12.292 --> 03:35:16.593]  If my site goes down, Alex has me on, I can talk here.
[03:35:16.593 --> 03:35:21.334]  If InfoWars were to go down, he could come on Natural News or Brighttown.com or what have you.
[03:35:21.334 --> 03:35:25.175]  And we've got Bandot Video as well, and we keep posting new mini-documentaries there.
[03:35:25.775 --> 03:35:27.458]  In fact, over the last few days as well.
[03:35:27.458 --> 03:35:29.080]  Thank God we have all these platforms.
[03:35:29.080 --> 03:35:30.943]  Thank God we're willing to fight.
[03:35:31.673 --> 03:35:38.216]  For our right to speak it, and your right to be part of this conversation that's being banned by the tech giants.
[03:35:38.216 --> 03:35:40.997]  They want to silence us by any means possible.
[03:35:40.997 --> 03:35:47.300]  And yet, here we are, still fighting for America, fighting for liberty, fighting for the First Amendment and the Second Amendment.
[03:35:47.300 --> 03:36:00.747]  Which reminds me, by the way, news, I don't know if Alex covered this, but yesterday it came out, or maybe it was this morning, that the Democrats in Virginia are now trying to ban criticism of Democrat
[03:36:01.522 --> 03:36:03.304]  Elected officials in Virginia.
[03:36:03.304 --> 03:36:15.054]  So under this new law, you would be criminally arrested for criticizing Governor Northam and calling him, you know, Mr. Coon-Faced Baby Killer or whatever you wanted to say.
[03:36:15.054 --> 03:36:16.575]  And he is.
[03:36:16.575 --> 03:36:17.456]  That's what he is.
[03:36:17.456 --> 03:36:19.297]  He's a psychopath in my view.
[03:36:19.297 --> 03:36:21.239]  But you would go to jail.
[03:36:21.894 --> 03:36:22.454]  For doing that.
[03:36:22.454 --> 03:36:30.440]  So not only is Virginia trying to ban the Second Amendment, but they're trying to ban the First Amendment as well, while creating, you know, kill zones!
[03:36:30.440 --> 03:36:38.306]  Kill zones for patriots, where you're unarmed, you're in a giant cage on the Capitol grounds, and they put snipers on the roofs of the buildings all around you.
[03:36:38.306 --> 03:36:49.754]  So they're creating a Las Vegas-style kill zone, where you are stuck in a cage, a literal cage, unarmed, unable to defend yourself, while Governor Northam says if you criticize him,
[03:36:50.580 --> 03:36:51.580]  You're a criminal.
[03:36:51.580 --> 03:36:57.543]  And this goes hand in hand with, I mean, look at the criminalization of journalism that is accelerating all around the world.
[03:36:57.543 --> 03:37:03.005]  It's not just the attacks on me and Natural News and Alex Jones and Infowars and other independent media sources.
[03:37:03.005 --> 03:37:05.967]  I mean, Tom Fitton from Judicial Watch, his stream was taken down.
[03:37:05.967 --> 03:37:08.668]  Right Side Broadcasting was taken down yesterday from YouTube.
[03:37:09.594 --> 03:37:11.175]  But look at the intercepts.
[03:37:11.175 --> 03:37:16.377]  Glenn Greenwald now facing a criminal charge from the government of Brazil.
[03:37:16.377 --> 03:37:17.157]  Are you kidding me?
[03:37:17.157 --> 03:37:24.540]  And look at Julian Assange still being tortured, absolutely tortured in prison.
[03:37:24.540 --> 03:37:26.761]  For how many years has that gone on now?
[03:37:26.761 --> 03:37:30.622]  I mean, Glenn Greenwald, you know, he's not a Trump supporter.
[03:37:30.622 --> 03:37:31.563]  He's not a liberal.
[03:37:31.563 --> 03:37:32.543]  He's not a conservative.
[03:37:32.543 --> 03:37:37.485]  But I got to tell you, Glenn Greenwald is one of the best independent journalists operating in the world today.
[03:37:38.243 --> 03:37:42.846]  And they're trying to criminalize him because he dares to conduct real journalism.
[03:37:42.846 --> 03:37:47.689]  That's his crime, is engaging in journalism.
[03:37:47.689 --> 03:37:51.351]  Because if you ask questions, then you are the enemy of the deep state.
[03:37:51.351 --> 03:37:52.752]  You're the enemy of the globalists.
[03:37:52.752 --> 03:37:55.073]  And they're coming for us all in one way or another.
[03:37:55.073 --> 03:37:56.574]  They're trying to take us all down.
[03:37:56.574 --> 03:37:57.855]  They're trying to throw us all in jail.
[03:37:58.760 --> 03:38:01.985]  And I agree with what Alex has said day after day.
[03:38:01.985 --> 03:38:07.472]  President Trump, you have got to pardon Julian Assange.
[03:38:07.472 --> 03:38:09.795]  Julian Assange has done nothing wrong.
[03:38:09.795 --> 03:38:10.977]  He is an innocent man.
[03:38:10.977 --> 03:38:12.519]  He has been framed.
[03:38:12.519 --> 03:38:14.121]  He has been tortured.
[03:38:14.121 --> 03:38:15.784]  He has been destroyed.
[03:38:16.371 --> 03:38:17.071]  By the deep state.
[03:38:17.071 --> 03:38:18.512]  And they're trying to kill him.
[03:38:18.512 --> 03:38:21.554]  I mean, Hillary Clinton wanted to kill him with a drone strike.
[03:38:21.554 --> 03:38:25.857]  I mean, at least Trump's drone strikes target terrorists.
[03:38:25.857 --> 03:38:28.819]  Where, you know, the Clinton's drone strikes target journalists, you know?
[03:38:28.819 --> 03:38:30.760]  That's the difference right there.
[03:38:30.760 --> 03:38:32.121]  But, here we go.
[03:38:33.183 --> 03:38:39.947]  We are doing our best to stay alive, to stay active, to stay safe, to be viable, and to stay online.
[03:38:39.947 --> 03:38:46.172]  And you look at Infowars coverage of what's going on in Washington, D.C., and the Women's March, and the trial in the Senate right now.
[03:38:46.172 --> 03:38:48.413]  It is just top-notch coverage.
[03:38:48.673 --> 03:38:54.275]  And by the way, if Millie Weaver needs to break in at any time, we can cut to her if she's got any breaking news from D.C.
[03:38:54.275 --> 03:38:56.056]  So I don't want anybody to miss anything there.
[03:38:56.056 --> 03:39:06.140]  But, you know, the work of Owen Schroer and, you know, I saw Will Johnson, his video out there, and Millie and Savannah and all the others that are there, Greg Reese and so on, just doing an incredible job.
[03:39:07.114 --> 03:39:12.078]  Even though InfoWars is just viciously attacked and smeared every single day.
[03:39:12.078 --> 03:39:14.940]  But we are here for you, so thank you for your support.
[03:39:14.940 --> 03:39:20.004]  Now, I'm going to get into, again, more of what we were just talking about.
[03:39:20.004 --> 03:39:24.107]  The fact is that leftists now are anti-environment.
[03:39:24.107 --> 03:39:34.455]  That, in fact, Democrats, or these radical leftists, I don't know what to call them anymore, these anti-humanists, they love toxic pesticides and herbicides.
[03:39:34.455 --> 03:39:35.596]  We've reached that point.
[03:39:36.129 --> 03:39:40.851]  Where you have David Hogg mocking Alex Jones for telling the truth about atrazine.
[03:39:40.851 --> 03:39:44.592]  So is David Hogg pro-atrazine?
[03:39:44.592 --> 03:39:47.213]  Are they now going to be pro-pesticide?
[03:39:47.213 --> 03:39:49.074]  Pro-herbicide?
[03:39:49.074 --> 03:39:52.315]  Is David Hogg pro-glyphosate as well?
[03:39:52.315 --> 03:39:53.636]  Pro-organophosphate?
[03:39:53.636 --> 03:39:54.536]  I don't know.
[03:39:54.536 --> 03:40:01.079]  But if he's going to mock Alex Jones for telling the truth about atrazine, what does this mean about these leftists?
[03:40:01.079 --> 03:40:02.019]  What about Greta Thunberg?
[03:40:02.705 --> 03:40:05.246]  She hasn't said a word about fluoride.
[03:40:05.246 --> 03:40:05.926]  Not to my knowledge.
[03:40:05.926 --> 03:40:13.388]  She hasn't said a word about bio-sludge contamination and mass pollution through this so-called fertilizer that's spread on farms and put into the food supply.
[03:40:13.388 --> 03:40:19.089]  That's made from the waste of every major city in America.
[03:40:19.089 --> 03:40:25.271]  You know this practice of collecting all the human waste from all the sewage and then dumping it on farms?
[03:40:25.271 --> 03:40:28.492]  This practice is outlawed in many European countries.
[03:40:29.719 --> 03:40:34.101]  But in America, somehow we do it because pollution is never wrong.
[03:40:34.101 --> 03:40:38.423]  And you know, according to the left anyway, and they say that pollution is good.
[03:40:38.423 --> 03:40:40.063]  Oh, it's recycling.
[03:40:40.063 --> 03:40:41.004]  It's recycling.
[03:40:41.004 --> 03:40:46.586]  And now they pass a law in Washington State where they can, they can have decomposed human bodies.
[03:40:46.586 --> 03:40:59.171]  So instead of being cremated or buried, you can be mixed with chemicals and flushed down the drain and added to the bio sludge that is then dumped on the food crops.
[03:40:59.171 --> 03:40:59.291]  So
[03:41:00.327 --> 03:41:11.174]  Food that you eat, that's grown in Washington State, the orchards, the apples and pears, and I don't know what else they have there, but they grow a lot of food in rural Washington State.
[03:41:11.174 --> 03:41:28.224]  If it's not organic, there is a chance that it could have been, quote, fertilized with dead, dissolved humans, and human waste, and everything that's flushed down the toilet, because that is what is put on croplands in America, and there's not a single
[03:41:28.852 --> 03:41:31.973]  Environmentalists that I know of that is speaking out about this.
[03:41:31.973 --> 03:41:33.834]  Not a single one.
[03:41:33.834 --> 03:41:39.957]  They'll tell you all day, oh, we're going to die because the oceans are going to rise in the year 2150 or something.
[03:41:39.957 --> 03:41:42.358]  And then you look at the oceans, they're not rising.
[03:41:42.358 --> 03:41:43.979]  You look at the glaciers, they're doing fine.
[03:41:43.979 --> 03:41:46.040]  They're not even melting in many cases.
[03:41:46.040 --> 03:41:46.760]  Some are getting bigger.
[03:41:46.760 --> 03:41:53.003]  You know, the temperature data are all faked by the left because they have to have to create this narrative that's not even true.
[03:41:53.857 --> 03:41:59.581]  But leftists are freaked out about things that aren't real, and then they ignore the things that are real.
[03:41:59.581 --> 03:42:01.102]  They ignore the bio-sludge pollution.
[03:42:01.102 --> 03:42:03.224]  They ignore the real chemical contamination.
[03:42:03.985 --> 03:42:05.326]  And then, guess what?
[03:42:05.326 --> 03:42:06.747]  Birth defects happen.
[03:42:06.747 --> 03:42:08.249]  Cancer happens.
[03:42:08.249 --> 03:42:09.730]  People lose their minds.
[03:42:09.730 --> 03:42:18.236]  People's brains are poisoned and contaminated and that causes them to go insane where they can't even participate in democracy and they end up voting for a Democrat, you know?
[03:42:18.236 --> 03:42:20.578]  Or just crapping all over the streets in San Francisco.
[03:42:20.578 --> 03:42:21.639]  Or maybe both!
[03:42:21.639 --> 03:42:26.043]  I think San Francisco is the only city where you can vote and then crap on the street where you just voted.
[03:42:26.043 --> 03:42:27.364]  You know, back to back.
[03:42:27.364 --> 03:42:28.645]  It's an amazing feat.
[03:42:29.778 --> 03:42:32.341]  For a city tied to Nancy Pelosi.
[03:42:32.341 --> 03:42:33.702]  I mean, oh.
[03:42:33.702 --> 03:42:34.282]  Oh my goodness.
[03:42:34.282 --> 03:42:35.343]  And what's wrong with her brain?
[03:42:35.343 --> 03:42:37.065]  Has she had too much bio-sludge?
[03:42:37.065 --> 03:42:37.565]  I think so.
[03:42:37.565 --> 03:42:38.386]  Maybe too much fluoride.
[03:42:38.386 --> 03:42:39.667]  Maybe both.
[03:42:39.667 --> 03:42:40.768]  Something's wrong.
[03:42:40.768 --> 03:42:43.550]  Something's wrong with her and something's wrong with these liberal cities.
[03:42:43.550 --> 03:42:45.492]  And we'll be back with more here on Infowars.com.
[03:42:45.492 --> 03:42:46.372]  This is Mike Adams.

[03:44:56.912 --> 03:45:07.277]  Your support and your help in rebooting Americana as a challenge to the globalist system of corporate tyranny has really caught hold, not just here in the U.S., but worldwide.
[03:45:07.277 --> 03:45:14.041]  And President Trump's fearlessness when it comes to promoting Americana and basic liberty is amazing as well.
[03:45:14.821 --> 03:45:24.571]  He's still lacking on the big tech censorship, taking action against that and some other areas, but trying to end the wars, boosting our economy, speaking out against communist China.
[03:45:24.571 --> 03:45:27.254]  Trump's been doing an amazing job, but now more than ever.
[03:45:28.114 --> 03:45:33.279]  We really have to realize that we're being targeted because we are effective.
[03:45:33.279 --> 03:45:38.243]  And the globalists are beginning to lose their war against humanity in a big way.
[03:45:38.243 --> 03:45:40.625]  And so we're going to see some major fireworks out of them.
[03:45:40.625 --> 03:45:46.390]  But it's critical to not let ourselves get down when we see all the poison they spray at us.
[03:45:46.390 --> 03:45:48.392]  That's an attempt to demoralize us.
[03:45:48.392 --> 03:45:51.495]  We've got to remember that and stay focused and stay happy.
[03:45:52.998 --> 03:45:59.501]  With the daily wear and tear of the environment on our skin, it's only natural that it starts to crack and take damage.
[03:45:59.501 --> 03:46:06.245]  Wind, heat, water, and age are telltale signs that it's time to start taking care of your skin.

[03:47:11.883 --> 03:47:15.144]  You found it, the tip of the spear.
[03:47:15.144 --> 03:47:21.985]  It is the Alex Jones Show with Mike Adams.
[03:47:21.985 --> 03:47:22.506]  Welcome back.
[03:47:22.506 --> 03:47:23.526]  Mike Adams here, Infowars.com.
[03:47:23.526 --> 03:47:27.847]  We're going to talk about the exploding pandemic of the coronavirus.
[03:47:27.847 --> 03:47:30.707]  Right now, there's a lot of breaking news on this.
[03:47:30.707 --> 03:47:35.028]  China has quarantined a city of 11 million people.
[03:47:35.028 --> 03:47:37.229]  We have a confirmed case in the United States.
[03:47:38.012 --> 03:47:50.117]  We have an estimated 20,000 possible infections based on a projection of one analysis of reported cases projecting it to unreported cases.
[03:47:50.117 --> 03:47:50.917]  That's conjecture.
[03:47:50.917 --> 03:47:52.197]  It may be true.
[03:47:52.197 --> 03:47:53.038]  Maybe a high number.
[03:47:53.038 --> 03:47:54.438]  Maybe a low number.
[03:47:54.438 --> 03:47:58.880]  We have incubation periods that are unknown for this coronavirus.
[03:47:58.880 --> 03:48:04.362]  And yet we have international flights still leaving the Wuhan airport in China.
[03:48:04.989 --> 03:48:11.791]  Because of Chinese New Year, and to all my freedom-loving friends in Hong Kong and Taiwan, 新年快乐!
[03:48:11.791 --> 03:48:18.614]  That means Happy New Year in Chinese, if I can get the intonation correct.
[03:48:20.103 --> 03:48:31.397]  And by the way, love all of you in Hong Kong, freedom lovers there, and all you freedom lovers in Taiwan, and congratulations on the victory of your president for re-election.
[03:48:31.397 --> 03:48:36.543]  We hope to achieve the same pro-freedom victory of our president for re-election here as well.
[03:48:36.543 --> 03:48:38.326]  The bullying of China will not succeed.
[03:48:38.866 --> 03:48:42.447]  Against the freedom-loving citizens of Taiwan and Hong Kong.
[03:48:42.447 --> 03:48:48.108]  However, China is becoming an incubation factory for this coronavirus.
[03:48:48.108 --> 03:48:53.970]  This is the next pandemic that is already starting to cause some panic around the world as it appears to be spreading.
[03:48:53.970 --> 03:48:58.331]  There's another case of a 57-year-old man that was found near the Mexico border.
[03:48:58.331 --> 03:49:02.712]  He had traveled to Beijing as well as the Wuhan region in China.
[03:49:03.488 --> 03:49:07.210]  And he's he's believed to be infected with this virus as well.
[03:49:07.210 --> 03:49:23.060]  It's only a matter of time before this spreads to other cities, because now you have Chinese New Year patrons from China traveling to Japan and Korea and the Philippines, Malaysia, Thailand, Australia and many other places throughout Southeast Asia.
[03:49:23.060 --> 03:49:27.363]  And even, of course, Canada and Toronto and and North America as well.
[03:49:27.363 --> 03:49:29.684]  So you're going to you're going to see the spread.
[03:49:30.310 --> 03:49:43.312]  Now, what's interesting, and Alex pointed this out earlier, is that the FDA has approved, apparently, a vaccine just recently for this particular strain of coronavirus.
[03:49:43.312 --> 03:49:46.173]  And that vaccine, I mean, imagine the timing of this.
[03:49:46.173 --> 03:49:52.334]  So you have a vaccine that comes out just as the pandemic of this weaponized virus begins to spread.
[03:49:52.334 --> 03:49:58.495]  And yes, I believe it's weaponized because it achieved first animal-to-human transmission and then human-to-human transmission.
[03:49:59.187 --> 03:50:03.548]  That's pretty difficult for a natural virus to achieve on its own so quickly.
[03:50:03.548 --> 03:50:06.088]  It's possible, but it's difficult.
[03:50:06.088 --> 03:50:16.451]  The speed of these mutations and adaptation into cross-species life forms is an indication of its likely origins as a bioengineered weapon.
[03:50:16.451 --> 03:50:23.492]  And we know that, of course, governments of the world, including the United States, even though treaties prevent it, have been engaged in bioweapons development.
[03:50:23.492 --> 03:50:26.073]  And the way they do it is they run off-site bioweapons
[03:50:27.657 --> 03:50:29.038]  Headquarters, essentially.
[03:50:29.038 --> 03:50:33.281]  And in the United States, we run bioweapons development in, guess where?
[03:50:33.281 --> 03:50:34.541]  Africa.
[03:50:34.541 --> 03:50:35.102]  Yes.
[03:50:35.102 --> 03:50:39.985]  How do you think Ebola keeps escaping and hitting different tribes there in Africa?
[03:50:39.985 --> 03:50:41.766]  Because they're testing it, by the way.
[03:50:41.766 --> 03:50:44.788]  They're trying to see what happens with this strain.
[03:50:44.788 --> 03:50:49.071]  You know, Ebola 42, Ebola 43, Ebola revision 44.
[03:50:49.071 --> 03:50:52.553]  They're testing the different strains to see what happens.
[03:50:52.553 --> 03:50:55.715]  And they're looking to fine-tune a very specific combination
[03:50:56.316 --> 03:50:57.618]  We're good to go.
[03:51:08.542 --> 03:51:25.034]  And the challenge, and one of the reasons why I can speak about this as a scientist, you know, I think this is one of the reasons why I'm being censored so aggressively is because I work in a lab and I can talk about this, but normally balancing those two things, if you're trying to engineer a bioweapon, is very, very difficult.
[03:51:25.034 --> 03:51:29.837]  Typically, viruses that have very high fatality rates also tend to have very short incubation periods.
[03:51:30.683 --> 03:51:32.485]  Not always the case, but that's the trend.
[03:51:32.485 --> 03:51:39.131]  So, what they, the globalists, the anti-human population globalists, have managed to engineer, it appears...
[03:51:39.893 --> 03:51:50.659]  Is a very long incubation period during which the patient is asymptomatic, meaning they can't be diagnosed with this devastating virus.
[03:51:50.659 --> 03:52:00.884]  And then when the symptoms hit, they hit hard and aggressively and they can overwhelm the patient and the fatality rate can be quite devastating.
[03:52:00.884 --> 03:52:07.648]  Now, right now for this particular virus, the reported fatality rate is relatively low, something like under 5% at the moment, but
[03:52:10.126 --> 03:52:19.118]  That's just early data and that may change and also the virus may adapt to the human organism and become more fatal.
[03:52:19.118 --> 03:52:25.927]  There's another theory in all of this in the weaponization development sector, so to speak, is that this can be part of a binary weapon system.
[03:52:26.267 --> 03:52:38.552]  So that this virus may be further weaponized through interaction with certain chemicals that are put into the food supply, such as hormone disruptors, hormone mimickers, or pesticides, herbicides, things that we've talked about before.
[03:52:38.552 --> 03:52:44.715]  Or in the presence of certain fluorinated chemicals, for example, that's put into the water supply in the United States.
[03:52:44.715 --> 03:52:55.400]  So just because a virus is killing people by itself doesn't mean that it can't kill a lot more people in conjunction with other vectors of depopulation that are also being
[03:52:56.707 --> 03:52:59.848]  Just released upon humanity, including 5G.
[03:52:59.848 --> 03:53:08.850]  You look at the electromagnetic pollution and what that does to human neurology and how that impacts, in fact, what's called the ion-gated calcium channels.
[03:53:08.850 --> 03:53:22.854]  So when you're exposed to this 5G radiation, it changes the permeability of the cell membranes in your body and it causes calcium ions to be pushed into the cells at concentrations that are toxic and in some cases even fatal.
[03:53:23.554 --> 03:53:31.679]  This is why there are documented effects of 5G exposure that include neuropsychiatric effects, which means it alters your personality.
[03:53:31.679 --> 03:53:37.542]  It changes your brain function, your behavior, your reaction to reality.
[03:53:37.542 --> 03:53:38.943]  It's literal brain control.
[03:53:39.723 --> 03:53:46.408]  Can that interact with a viral strain or RNA fragments from viral strains that are now spreading in the wild?
[03:53:46.408 --> 03:53:47.329]  Yes, perhaps.
[03:53:47.329 --> 03:53:57.576]  There's a technology called RNA interference technology that has been developed, in fact, by the pesticide manufacturers in order to kill pests who are eating food crops.
[03:53:58.727 --> 03:54:04.871]  RNA interference technology uses protein fragments to target specific physiological functions of the human body.
[03:54:04.871 --> 03:54:09.273]  They can target your reproductive capabilities or they can target neurological function.
[03:54:09.273 --> 03:54:14.036]  So they can literally retard your brain function through this RNA interference technology.
[03:54:14.036 --> 03:54:27.523]  So I'm kind of giving you a combination, a cocktail of all of the available weapon systems that these mad scientists have at their disposal that may be related to this outbreak of this coronavirus coming from, well, reportedly China.
[03:54:28.664 --> 03:54:30.584]  Probably it was just released in China.
[03:54:30.584 --> 03:54:39.366]  It probably came from a lab by a government, you know, somewhere else and then it was just released in Beijing or released in Wuhan province or somewhere else like that.
[03:54:39.366 --> 03:54:44.968]  So, the bottom line, the big picture folks, is that humanity is under attack.
[03:54:44.968 --> 03:54:49.069]  The globalists and the deep state have declared war on humanity.
[03:54:49.069 --> 03:54:50.349]  They hate human life.
[03:54:51.147 --> 03:54:52.809]  This is why they kill babies.
[03:54:52.809 --> 03:54:54.532]  And that's why they celebrate killing babies.
[03:54:54.532 --> 03:54:56.855]  They hate human liberty, human freedom.
[03:54:56.855 --> 03:54:58.357]  They hate human ingenuity.
[03:54:58.357 --> 03:55:00.099]  That's why they're anti-free market.
[03:55:00.099 --> 03:55:04.746]  They hate human creativity, which is why they demand absolute obedience and no diversity of thought.
[03:55:05.583 --> 03:55:09.264]  You know, diversity of thought is banned on YouTube, and Facebook, and everywhere else.
[03:55:09.264 --> 03:55:18.166]  You must comply and conform to their obedient demands of what you're allowed to think, or speak, or read, or watch, or report.
[03:55:18.166 --> 03:55:24.728]  And if you go outside those boundaries, then of course you're banned, and you're called an evil person, and you're censored, like we're being censored today.
[03:55:24.728 --> 03:55:27.748]  You're attacked, just viciously smeared and silenced.
[03:55:27.748 --> 03:55:31.949]  So, all of this is related.
[03:55:31.949 --> 03:55:33.930]  None of what you're seeing right now is an accident.
[03:55:34.756 --> 03:55:37.277]  And it's only going to get worse.
[03:55:37.277 --> 03:55:44.559]  They are going to release more weapons, whether biological or chemical or radiological or self-replicating systems.
[03:55:44.559 --> 03:55:46.560]  More weapons will be released.
[03:55:46.560 --> 03:55:49.441]  There will be more human weapons carrying
[03:55:50.248 --> 03:56:07.735]  The biological weapons into the United States, crossing the open border, arriving via air travel, or being planted in cities across America as the State Department has done for many years in order to try to put Ebola in American cities like Austin, Texas, for example.
[03:56:07.735 --> 03:56:09.896]  We are suffering an invasion.
[03:56:09.896 --> 03:56:10.836]  We are under attack.
[03:56:10.836 --> 03:56:12.296]  Humanity is on the brink.
[03:56:14.477 --> 03:56:20.020]  The very voices that are working to protect and save humanity are the voices that are targeted and silenced.
[03:56:20.020 --> 03:56:24.262]  And that's why your support for InfoWars.com is absolutely crucial.
[03:56:24.930 --> 03:56:26.271]  Support this network.
[03:56:26.271 --> 03:56:28.253]  I do as well.
[03:56:28.253 --> 03:56:29.734]  As you know, that's why I'm here.
[03:56:29.734 --> 03:56:30.675]  Support InfoWars.com.
[03:56:30.675 --> 03:56:32.336]  Check out InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:56:32.336 --> 03:56:38.101]  If you're not getting an air filter and a water filter and using those daily, you're crazy.
[03:56:38.101 --> 03:56:39.982]  Seriously, you're crazy.
[03:56:39.982 --> 03:56:42.704]  If you're drinking tap water, it's like a slow suicide.
[03:56:42.704 --> 03:56:45.927]  If you're breathing indoor air in your house without filtering it,
[03:56:46.539 --> 03:56:55.224]  You are breathing the dust that's blown off the bio-sludge farms and the glyphosate spraying of farms that could be miles away.
[03:56:55.224 --> 03:56:59.547]  You're inhaling glyphosate if you're not using an air filter.
[03:56:59.547 --> 03:57:05.070]  The world is being made toxic on purpose, but you have means to protect yourself.
[03:57:05.070 --> 03:57:06.051]  Are you using those means?
[03:57:07.006 --> 03:57:09.788]  If not, then you're on a suicide mission.
[03:57:09.788 --> 03:57:10.749]  And I don't think you are.
[03:57:10.749 --> 03:57:11.470]  I think you want to live.
[03:57:11.470 --> 03:57:13.411]  I think you respect human life, and that's why you're watching.
[03:57:13.411 --> 03:57:14.572]  That's why you're here.
[03:57:14.572 --> 03:57:15.833]  And I thank you for your support.
[03:57:15.833 --> 03:57:17.474]  I thank you for your prayers.
[03:57:17.474 --> 03:57:18.976]  And we're not going anywhere.
[03:57:18.976 --> 03:57:20.937]  We're going to keep fighting for humanity.
[03:57:20.937 --> 03:57:23.179]  We're going to keep defeating the globalists.
[03:57:23.179 --> 03:57:24.780]  We're going to keep telling the truth.
[03:57:24.780 --> 03:57:25.961]  We are the independent media.
[03:57:25.961 --> 03:57:30.385]  We're the real media now in America as the mainstream media has collapsed.
[03:57:30.385 --> 03:57:34.148]  We are Infowars.com, Natural News, The Gateway Pundit, many other
[03:57:34.861 --> 03:57:37.585]  Similar organizations, and we thank you for your support.
[03:57:37.585 --> 03:57:38.306]  War Room is up next.
