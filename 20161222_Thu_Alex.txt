[00:00.000 --> 00:22.340]  Rallying Patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty, you're listening to the Alex Jones
[00:22.340 --> 00:33.040]  Show. Welcome to the Alex Jones Show. I'm David Knight, your host today. We're going
[00:33.040 --> 00:37.640]  to be joined in the second hour by Stefan Malinu. We have a lot of news. We are going to be
[00:37.640 --> 00:43.000]  looking at whether or not the GOP really wants to get rid of Obamacare. Of course they don't.
[00:43.000 --> 00:47.760]  They never offered a plan to get rid of Obamacare. We know that. We know that they ran Mitt Romney,
[00:47.760 --> 00:54.020]  who had already enacted Obamacare, is RomneyCare in Massachusetts along with Ted Kennedy. And now
[00:54.020 --> 00:59.180]  we have an interesting article talking about how they're considering holding off on repealing
[00:59.180 --> 01:02.900]  Obamacare taxes. This is from the Hill. So we're going to talk about that. We're also going to
[01:02.900 --> 01:07.780]  talk about the Obama transition team. You've heard a lot about the Trump transition team.
[01:07.780 --> 01:13.220]  Have you heard about the Obama transition team? We've never had a situation in this century
[01:13.220 --> 01:19.300]  where the president has remained in Washington after leaving office. They've always retired and
[01:19.300 --> 01:25.820]  gone back to their business in the 18th and 19th century. But in the 20th century, we've only had
[01:25.820 --> 01:33.180]  Woodrow Wilson remain around Washington. But now we have Mr. Obama is going to remain in Washington.
[01:33.180 --> 01:39.940]  And he is going to, he's already rented a $5.3 million home. I talked to Dr. Randy Scott,
[01:39.940 --> 01:47.140]  who went to Harvard and he talked about how Obama is going to be the president of the race
[01:47.140 --> 01:50.380]  movement. He's going to be a race leader. That's how he's going to present himself. But he's got
[01:50.380 --> 01:54.460]  a lot of other things that he's going to be doing as well. By the way, that interview with Dr.
[01:54.460 --> 02:01.900]  Randy Scott will air on Monday's nightly news. But he's also preparing an entire shadow cabinet,
[02:01.900 --> 02:07.180]  kind of like they do in the UK, where they have people at every level. He's going to be going
[02:07.180 --> 02:13.660]  with Eric Holder to challenge the GOP legislatures on redistricting, because that's something that
[02:13.660 --> 02:19.700]  they do at the legislative level. See, they can't achieve their objectives in the ballot box. So
[02:19.700 --> 02:23.340]  what they want to do is get activist judges. So we're going to talk about that. We also have
[02:23.340 --> 02:29.940]  a CIA analyst who goes off on the Bush fake weapons of mass destruction. We have some interesting
[02:29.940 --> 02:35.620]  revelations about the Facebook algorithm that's going to be used to determine who is fake and
[02:35.620 --> 02:40.020]  who isn't, according to them, and the way that they're going to censor your free speech on Facebook,
[02:40.020 --> 02:46.420]  if you're still there. And we have learned some interesting things about Snopes, the people
[02:46.420 --> 02:51.380]  that are going to be vetting all the news for Facebook. There's a nasty divorce filing that
[02:51.380 --> 02:56.940]  has now gone public, and it has exposed some of the inner workings of Snopes that you will not
[02:56.940 --> 03:02.100]  believe. And we're also going to have in the next segment, we're going to talk about the Federal
[03:02.100 --> 03:07.860]  Reserve. We have the Christmas special that I did. It was three years ago. It was on the 100th
[03:07.860 --> 03:13.620]  anniversary of the Federal Reserve. And at the time, we did a comparison because, you know,
[03:13.620 --> 03:19.220]  they created the Federal Reserve on Christmas vacation. That was the tactic that they used.
[03:19.220 --> 03:24.660]  They waited until most of the Congress had gone home for Christmas, and then they rushed this
[03:24.660 --> 03:30.100]  thing through that had been prepared for them by J.P. Morgan and others. The beast from Jekyll Island
[03:30.100 --> 03:38.100]  as it's been called. I forget. Jedward Griffin, who wrote that book. But anyway, we have a
[03:39.380 --> 03:44.020]  special video for you that we do at Christmas time. It's a wonderful lie, 100 years of the Federal
[03:44.020 --> 03:50.900]  Reserve. And that's been 103 years of the Federal Reserve. And the lie just keeps going and going.
[03:50.900 --> 03:55.620]  We can't even audit them. I think it's one of the reasons why they're concerned about Donald
[03:55.620 --> 04:00.100]  Trump. Hopefully, he will at least audit the Federal Reserve. I think that's the first step.
[04:00.100 --> 04:03.780]  It's a very important step. We need to understand what's going on there. We also have a clip. I
[04:03.780 --> 04:10.740]  want to play after that of a questioning of the Federal Reserve's Inspector General a couple
[04:10.740 --> 04:15.620]  of years ago. But it's very telling to see the back and forth when they ask them, you know,
[04:15.620 --> 04:20.260]  there's like $9 trillion that was loaned out. We don't have any record of that to these banks
[04:20.260 --> 04:25.540]  during the bailout. What are you doing that? Have you investigated that? No, no. We have
[04:25.540 --> 04:29.700]  not really looked at that. Well, that's your job, isn't it? Well, I don't really want to comment on
[04:29.700 --> 04:34.020]  that. So we're going to take a close look at the Federal Reserve, do it in the context of Christmas,
[04:34.020 --> 05:00.020]  do it in the context of its wonderful life. Stay with us. We'll be right back.
[05:00.020 --> 05:04.420]  We're learning more than ever about the Tunisian asylum seeker wanted in the Berlin massacre.
[05:04.420 --> 05:09.140]  He was jailed for four years in Italy for burning down a school and arrested three separate times
[05:09.140 --> 05:15.540]  in Germany before police, quote, lost him. Anas army was also on the US no fly list and he settled
[05:15.540 --> 05:20.100]  in Italy after leaving his hometown in Tunisia. Now his father claimed this at a radio interview.
[05:20.100 --> 05:25.620]  There's currently a reward on his head. 100,000 euro. He spent four years in an Italian jail
[05:25.620 --> 05:30.260]  for burning down a school before he left for Germany last year. The 23 year old was arrested
[05:30.260 --> 05:35.300]  three times, but authorities allowed him to slip through the cracks, even though he had been identified
[05:35.300 --> 05:40.420]  as an ISIS supporter and had received weapons training. Apparently security forces exchanged
[05:40.420 --> 05:46.420]  information as recently as last month about army and his ties to the Islamic state as reported by
[05:46.420 --> 05:50.980]  Fox News. It still didn't stop officials from detaining him. They wouldn't kick him out of the
[05:50.980 --> 05:56.500]  country and he was allowed to ultimately wreak havoc in Berlin, killing 12 people and injuring
[05:56.500 --> 06:02.500]  50 more. I'm Margaret Hall reporting for info wars.com. I am very proud to announce the introduction

[08:11.540 --> 08:17.780]  Live from Austin, Texas broadcasting worldwide it's Alex Jones.
[08:21.620 --> 08:25.780]  Welcome to the Alex Jones Show. I'm David Knight your host and I guess that makes me the night
[08:25.780 --> 08:30.340]  before Christmas. We're gonna talk about Christmas. We're gonna talk about Christmas also in the context
[08:30.340 --> 08:36.580]  of it's a wonderful life and the Federal Reserve. I want to play a special that I did three years
[08:36.580 --> 08:40.820]  ago on the 100th anniversary of the Federal Reserve because you know they created as Christmas as I
[08:40.820 --> 08:46.500]  just said in the last segment the opening segment. It was done when most of the Congress had gone on
[08:46.500 --> 08:51.540]  Christmas vacation because it was a bit of subterfuge. A lot of subterfuge and it's been 100
[08:51.540 --> 08:57.780]  years now 103 years that this has been going on. Before I play this though I just want to I saw
[08:57.780 --> 09:03.220]  this article from the New York Daily News very liberal paper in New York very inaccurate in a
[09:03.220 --> 09:08.740]  lot of ways and I think this is a very interesting take on it's a wonderful life. They said that
[09:08.740 --> 09:15.300]  we're all living in Potterville right now and they said in 2016 we all voted for Mr. Potter.
[09:15.300 --> 09:18.980]  Now if you remember the movie and I'm going to show you a clip here we talk about the Federal
[09:18.980 --> 09:24.580]  Reserve in this context because it was if you think that Trump is Potter remember Trump is the
[09:24.580 --> 09:31.460]  builder like George Bailey. Potter is the banker okay and the reality is they come in they say the
[09:31.460 --> 09:37.140]  Bailey brothers building alone is no mere plot point and a Christmas story but a rallying cry
[09:37.140 --> 09:42.980]  against a capitalist system that ground up George Bailey and spat him out. See the New York Daily
[09:42.980 --> 09:50.260]  News cannot discern the difference between a free market and a manipulated crony market
[09:50.260 --> 09:55.620]  manipulated by the Federal Reserve. That's the key difference they don't understand the difference
[09:55.620 --> 10:00.500]  between those two things and they go on to say no wonder Jagger Hoover's FBI investigated its
[10:00.500 --> 10:07.300]  wonderful life for possible connections to a communist plot. Okay a communist plot okay it
[10:07.300 --> 10:14.180]  was a red scare. He did it on behalf of the bankers New York Daily News. They just used the
[10:14.180 --> 10:18.580]  Russians as a beard. I want to play this report you'll see what's going on in this report.
[10:18.580 --> 10:24.820]  Look at my parallels to the Federal Reserve. Over the last 100 years the Federal Reserve
[10:24.820 --> 10:30.020]  has created bubbles and burst them enslaved us with debt and destroyed our purchasing power
[10:30.020 --> 10:36.820]  through inflation. Yes it's been a wonderful lie for the bankers. There are striking parallels in
[10:36.820 --> 10:41.940]  Frank Capra's it's a wonderful life to the lies and tricks that real bankers used to create the
[10:41.940 --> 10:48.900]  Federal Reserve. Human nature doesn't change and the greedy elite of 1913 and 2013 look and act a
[10:48.900 --> 10:55.860]  lot like Potter the banker in the movie. And many Americans are left like George Bailey staring into
[10:55.860 --> 11:00.580]  the abyss as their dreams collapse and they face financial ruin. Do we live in a country that looks
[11:00.580 --> 11:05.940]  a lot more like Pottersville than Bedford Falls? What does Frank Capra's film show us about how we
[11:05.940 --> 11:11.220]  got here and how we can get out? When the Federal Reserve was created two days before Christmas 100
[11:11.220 --> 11:17.460]  years ago it was a culmination of six years of fraud, fear and manipulation. I've never really
[11:17.460 --> 11:23.860]  seen one but that's got all the earmarks of being a run. The panic of 1907 was used to shape public
[11:23.860 --> 11:28.420]  support for the Fed. The panic was triggered by rumors that two major banks were about to become
[11:28.420 --> 11:34.900]  insolvent just as we see in the movie. George there is a rumor around town that you close your doors
[11:34.900 --> 11:42.580]  is that true? I am going all out to help in this crisis. I have just guaranteed the banks
[11:42.580 --> 11:50.260]  sufficient funds to meet their needs. They will close up for a week and then reopen. Just took
[11:50.260 --> 11:58.100]  over the bank. I may lose a fortune but I am willing to guarantee your people too. Just tell
[11:58.100 --> 12:03.380]  them to bring their shares over here and I will pay fifty cents on the dollar. Are you never
[12:03.380 --> 12:08.740]  miss a trick do you Potter? Unfortunately JP Morgan got away with a deception and was able
[12:08.740 --> 12:14.500]  to shut down competitors and snapped up assets at fire cell prices. Take during the depression
[12:14.500 --> 12:20.340]  for instance you and I were the only ones that kept our heads. You saved the building alone
[12:21.140 --> 12:27.780]  I saved all the rest. Yes well most people say you stole all the rest. The envious ones say that George
[12:27.780 --> 12:32.900]  the suckers. Charles Lindbergh Sr. warned people at the time of the creation of the Federal Reserve
[12:32.900 --> 12:37.140]  that it would not stop boom and bust cycles but would actually create them in order to benefit
[12:37.140 --> 12:42.820]  its private owners. Here's what he said. To cause high prices all the Federal Reserve Board will do
[12:42.820 --> 12:48.180]  will be to lower the re-discount rate producing an expansion of credit and a rising stock market.
[12:48.180 --> 12:52.020]  Then when businessmen are adjusted to these conditions it can check prosperity and mid
[12:52.020 --> 12:56.740]  career by arbitrarily raising the rate of interest. It can cause a pendulum of rising and falling
[12:56.740 --> 13:01.860]  market to swing gently back and forth or cause violent fluctuations by greater rate variation.
[13:01.860 --> 13:07.620]  In either case it will possess inside information as to the financial conditions and advanced
[13:07.620 --> 13:12.820]  knowledge of the coming change either up or down. This is the strangest most dangerous
[13:12.820 --> 13:17.300]  advantage ever placed in the hands of a special privileged class by any government that ever
[13:17.300 --> 13:22.660]  existed. The system is private conducted for the sole purpose of a painting the greatest possible
[13:22.660 --> 13:27.060]  profits from the use of other people's money. They know in advance when to create panics to
[13:27.060 --> 13:33.060]  their advantage and they know when to stop panic. Inflation and deflation work equally well for them
[13:33.060 --> 13:38.900]  when they control the finance. As we see in the movie not all lending institutions have the same
[13:38.900 --> 13:46.660]  motivations. Now you take this loan here the money bishop you know the fellow that sits around all
[13:46.660 --> 13:54.020]  day on his brain and his taxi you know. I happen to know the bank turned down this loan but he
[13:54.020 --> 14:02.500]  comes here and we're building him a house worth five thousand dollars. Why? Well I handled that
[14:02.500 --> 14:07.140]  Mr. Potter. You have all the papers there as salary insurance I can personally vouch for his
[14:07.140 --> 14:14.260]  character. Friend of yours. Yes sir. You see if you shoot pool with some employee here you can
[14:14.260 --> 14:22.500]  come and borrow money. What does that get us? A discontented lazy rabble instead of a thrifty
[14:22.500 --> 14:28.020]  working class. As a former FDIC chair said all too often the large banks use their models and
[14:28.020 --> 14:32.340]  their algorithms and if you don't fit in their boxes you don't get the loan. And Dodd-Frank
[14:32.340 --> 14:37.380]  legislation is tying the hands of small lenders shutting out buyers and shutting down lenders.
[14:37.380 --> 14:41.540]  Today there are fewer lenders than at any time the government has kept records. Ten thousand
[14:41.540 --> 14:48.100]  banks disappeared between 1984 and 2011. This town needs this measly one-horse institution
[14:48.100 --> 14:53.780]  if only to have some place where people can come without crawling to Potter. Come on. In the movie
[14:53.780 --> 14:58.500]  George gets to see what happens to the small town if Potter didn't have competition from credit unions
[14:58.500 --> 15:03.380]  and smaller lenders. If it hadn't been for you. Yeah if it hadn't been for me everybody'd be a lot
[15:03.380 --> 15:08.500]  better off. My wife and my kids and my friends and me look little fella why you go up and haunt
[15:08.500 --> 15:13.700]  somebody else. Yeah so you still think killing yourself would make everyone feel happier right?
[15:13.700 --> 15:17.460]  Well I don't know I guess you're right.
[15:19.700 --> 15:23.940]  It's supposed to have been better if I'd never been born at all. Potter'sville the only businesses
[15:23.940 --> 15:29.860]  thriving are vice. People are angry. The town is filled with signs like keep moving keep off the
[15:29.860 --> 15:35.380]  grass. Bert the cop actually shoots at George when he's running away and is no threat to anyone.
[15:35.380 --> 15:47.140]  Everyone is a renter no one has a stake. Now you're Arnie Bishop and you live in Bailey Park with
[15:47.140 --> 15:51.620]  your wife and kid. Look but what's the idea I live in a shack in Pottersfield my wife ran away
[15:51.620 --> 15:56.020]  three years ago and took the kid and I ain't never seen you before in my life see. Private property
[15:56.020 --> 16:01.460]  and everyone having a stake is the antidote to Potter'sville. Here you're all businessmen here
[16:01.460 --> 16:05.940]  go to make them better citizens doesn't make them better customers but whether it's the Trans Pacific
[16:05.940 --> 16:11.540]  Partnership or a global carbon tax the global elite don't see you as a stakeholder they want
[16:11.540 --> 16:16.820]  to turn us all into serfs and treat us like cattle. Just remember this Mr. Potter that this
[16:16.820 --> 16:21.380]  rabble you're talking about they do most of the working and paying and living and dying in this
[16:21.380 --> 16:25.540]  community well is it too much to have them work and pay and live and die in a couple of decent
[16:25.540 --> 16:32.580]  rooms in a bath anyway my father didn't think so people were human beings to him but to you a warped
[16:32.580 --> 16:37.620]  frustrated old man they're cattle well in my book he died a much richer man than you will ever be.
[16:37.620 --> 16:43.300]  I'm not interested in your book I'm talking about the building alone. I know very well what you're
[16:43.300 --> 16:47.380]  talking about you're talking about something you can't get your fingers on. Speaking of riches
[16:47.380 --> 16:52.500]  do you find the salary amounts amusing when Potter tries to buy George off? Look at your side
[16:52.500 --> 17:08.980]  young man 27 28 married make me say 40 a week 45 45 45 George I'll start you out at $20,000 a year.
[17:13.460 --> 17:21.220]  $20,000 a year you wouldn't mind living in the nicest house in town buying your wife a lot of
[17:21.220 --> 17:27.780]  fine clothes a couple of business trips to New York a year maybe once in a while Europe you wouldn't
[17:27.780 --> 17:34.260]  mind that would you John would I even if George had saved a lot of his $20,000 salary would it have
[17:34.260 --> 17:39.060]  bought much a couple of decades later by even the government's very conservative estimate of
[17:39.060 --> 17:45.780]  inflation the dollar has lost 90% of its value since 1947 when the movie was made the Fed's
[17:45.780 --> 17:50.420]  deliberate inflation is devastating to anyone trying to accumulate wealth through hard work

[25:39.220 --> 25:43.940]  important i use all the time it's one of the few things that i feel you know i i don't get the kind
[25:43.940 --> 25:50.340]  of rushes like my wife does she can take coffee and it will literally give her the jitters if she
[25:50.340 --> 25:55.060]  drinks a large cup of coffee so she just takes one brain force and she said she can feel it not
[25:55.060 --> 25:59.300]  that it makes her jittery but that it focuses her mind and that's what it does with me as well
[25:59.300 --> 26:06.420]  also at the info wars live store we've got 30 off living defense 50 off silver bullet colloidal

[26:51.860 --> 26:57.940]  store it helps to support our operation i want to go back to it's a wonderful life and the take
[26:57.940 --> 27:02.900]  that the liberal new york daily news took on it they said no wonder jagger hoover's fbi investigated
[27:02.900 --> 27:07.780]  it's a wonderful life or possible connections to a communist plot as i pointed out you know this is
[27:07.780 --> 27:12.820]  typical tactics it wasn't because they thought that it was a communist plot or because it was
[27:12.820 --> 27:18.500]  anti-capitalist but because it attacked the system the establishment which is the federal reserve
[27:18.500 --> 27:23.300]  to the federal reserve created at christmas time when most of the congress was on vacation
[27:23.300 --> 27:28.900]  it's the christmas gift to the elite that just keeps on giving 103 years into this it keeps on
[27:28.900 --> 27:32.500]  giving i will play a clip here in just a moment illustrates that one last thing from the new york
[27:32.500 --> 27:37.780]  daily news they say the film represented rather obvious attempts to discredit bankers by casting
[27:37.780 --> 27:42.980]  lionel barrymore as a scrooge type so that he would be the most hated man in the picture set
[27:42.980 --> 27:49.540]  in 1947 fbi memo see their intention was to protect the banks not to protect capitalism
[27:49.540 --> 27:54.420]  it's not the same thing as you saw in that clip just as the federal reserve used a banking crisis
[27:54.420 --> 28:00.420]  to create the federal reserve uh we saw that same sort of thing happening and it's a wonderful life
[28:00.420 --> 28:06.580]  now i want to play a clip here the hearing a couple of years ago where you had a congressional
[28:06.580 --> 28:13.140]  representative trying to get to the bottom of where uh nine trillion dollars worth of loans
[28:13.140 --> 28:17.860]  went that were handed out to people and he's talking to the inspector general of the federal
[28:17.860 --> 28:23.060]  reserve this illustrates why we must have an audit here's that clip i have a copy of the inspector
[28:23.060 --> 28:26.660]  general act here in front of me it says among other things that it's your responsibility to
[28:26.660 --> 28:31.220]  conduct and supervise audits and investigations relating to the programs and operations of your
[28:31.220 --> 28:36.180]  agency that's correct so i'm asking you if your agency has in fact according to bloomberg
[28:36.180 --> 28:40.420]  extended nine trillion dollars in credit which by the way works out to thirty thousand dollars
[28:40.420 --> 28:45.620]  for every single man woman and child in this country i'd like to know if you're not responsible
[28:45.620 --> 28:55.460]  for investigating that who is we actually we have responsibility for the federal reserves programs
[28:55.460 --> 29:03.220]  and operations audits to conduct audits and investigations in that area um in terms of
[29:03.220 --> 29:09.620]  who's responsible for investigating would you mind repeating the question one more time what have you
[29:09.620 --> 29:15.780]  done nice try to investigate the off-balance sheet transactions conducted by the federal reserve
[29:15.780 --> 29:20.740]  which according to bloomberg now total nine trillion dollars in the last eight months
[29:22.340 --> 29:28.900]  i'll have to look specifically at that bloomberg article i i'm not um i i don't know if i have
[29:28.900 --> 29:33.220]  actually seen that particular one that's not the point the question is have you done any
[29:33.220 --> 29:38.500]  investigation or auditing of off-balance sheet transactions conducted by the federal reserve
[29:38.500 --> 29:43.460]  there we go i see that illustrates and that's how in greyson that illustrates why we need an
[29:43.460 --> 29:48.420]  audit of the federal reserve they keep dodging and ducking even the person who's supposed to
[29:48.420 --> 29:54.340]  audit them does stay with us and be right back with alex jones the empires on the run alex jones
[29:54.340 --> 30:03.220]  and the gcn radio network an alarming report coming out of campus reform that talks about
[30:03.220 --> 30:08.420]  how muslim students are demanding prayer rooms in every major building now students at the
[30:08.420 --> 30:13.540]  university of maryland they've released a list of 64 of their demands all in an effort to make
[30:13.540 --> 30:20.820]  their campus quote more amenable this project it's known as protect umd it's an effort between 25
[30:20.820 --> 30:26.100]  different student organizations at the university of maryland this news is coming just after the
[30:26.100 --> 30:31.300]  ohio state attack where we saw one muslim student who felt marginalized he actually took out his
[30:31.300 --> 30:35.940]  frustration and plowed into a crowd of students and then began stabbing them millie weaver took
[30:35.940 --> 30:41.460]  to the streets on ohio states campus shortly after and so did rebel media and they asked students
[30:41.460 --> 30:46.100]  why they thought that this one muslim student in particular decided to quote act out and
[30:46.100 --> 30:50.820]  surprisingly students said that he probably felt marginalized so it looks like the university of
[30:50.820 --> 30:55.300]  maryland is tackling that and they're going to allow students to have prayer rooms now in every
[30:55.300 --> 31:00.020]  major building but only if you're muslim i'm margaret hell reporting for info wars dot com

[33:28.500 --> 33:33.620]  when he hasn't he's putting in rex tillison who's a big corporate leader but a business dealer and
[33:33.620 --> 33:38.980]  a guy that was how to get jobs in america and to get us cheaper energy and who's anti globalist
[33:38.980 --> 33:42.820]  until they pressured him and made him sign on to carbon taxes that was a big fight he was the main
[33:42.820 --> 33:49.300]  guy fighting man made global warming hoaxes up until 2006 they talk about moonshine and the rest
[33:49.300 --> 33:54.420]  of him he was anti nap to anti get yeah he was with golden sacks all the top people were so they're
[33:54.420 --> 34:00.100]  saying trumps could have dropped drain the swamp because he's been convinced sir uh they're pointing
[34:00.100 --> 34:05.300]  out you're hiring a bunch of washington insiders that's not draining the swamp he needs to define
[34:05.300 --> 34:09.860]  draining the swamp getting rid of the anti gunners getting rid of the people that want open borders
[34:09.860 --> 34:16.420]  the globalist uh standing up and he already has hired no lobbyist he followed the no lobbyist rule
[34:17.220 --> 34:25.460]  with the vice president heading that up okay uh mike pence he's done it all he's bringing in people
[34:25.460 --> 34:31.060]  that will follow nationalism he's bringing in a new head of the epa who's the attorney general of
[34:31.060 --> 34:35.860]  oklahoma who fought the carbon taxes and the whole climate change bs where they say that there's we
[34:35.860 --> 34:39.940]  don't believe in climate change of course there's climate change it's not man made and taxing people
[34:39.940 --> 34:46.100]  to al gore and wroth roth child doesn't help people so this is how they twisted genridge trump
[34:46.100 --> 34:50.820]  dropping drain the swamp genridge who's like an insider with the globalist one of the few people
[34:50.820 --> 34:56.180]  nothing trump better really watch notice he hasn't been appointed anything though he goes on npr kind
[34:56.180 --> 34:59.700]  of place that glenn bett goes oh well he's dropping that now he's just been pointed out he's bringing
[34:59.700 --> 35:04.340]  in insiders that's redefining he never said i won't bring in folks that know how to get stuff done
[35:04.340 --> 35:08.660]  in washington he said i'm going to get the second amendment back i'm going to defend our borders i'm
[35:08.660 --> 35:13.860]  going to deport the felons all this crap they're saying oh he was going to go after gaze he's backed
[35:13.860 --> 35:20.020]  off that was the right wings believing that because the left said he was trump never said that so the
[35:20.020 --> 35:24.580]  stupid gays and the stupid right wingers don't know what you're talking about you projected on
[35:24.580 --> 35:29.540]  to trump your bs so people are projecting on to trump things you didn't say or do uh they're also
[35:29.540 --> 35:34.340]  twisting and i'm not just mindlessly defending him if he starts not going after the gun controllers
[35:34.340 --> 35:38.420]  if he doesn't start trying to reverse the gun grabs if he doesn't try to go after the monopolies
[35:38.420 --> 35:43.220]  they've been setting up uh what she's saying he's going to do if he doesn't uh you know trying to
[35:43.220 --> 35:48.580]  control that border and deport criminals uh if he doesn't uh deliver on bringing more jobs back
[35:48.580 --> 35:54.820]  which we already see the biggest exuberance in gallup's history and confidence in the economy 60
[35:54.820 --> 36:01.380]  billion already brought back 50 billion japan 10 million steel carrier ford plants he's already
[36:01.380 --> 36:06.180]  delivering i said to be delivered on 20 30 40 percent and he really tried hard i'd be happy
[36:06.180 --> 36:13.140]  he's already delivered like 20 percent he's not even in office for 28 days i mean this is incredible
[36:13.140 --> 36:18.500]  uh what's happening but again they keep implying and then this is the problem trump
[36:18.500 --> 36:23.300]  has these advisors now who he trusts they're like sir they think drain the swamp means get rid
[36:23.300 --> 36:28.740]  and fire everybody oh he better quit using that then no no no he needs to come out and say drain
[36:28.740 --> 36:32.900]  the swamp means get people in whether they're outsiders or insiders like all these generals
[36:32.900 --> 36:37.060]  you know nobody does that to bring them into major department heads that's that's drain the swamp
[36:37.060 --> 36:43.300]  he's getting a bunch of nationalists and patriots like mattis and and and uh flinn who's total anti
[36:43.300 --> 36:49.380]  new world order and a listener of ours and anti jenna 21 and anti radical islam i mean i mean all
[36:49.380 --> 36:53.620]  these other generals are patriots i mean he's put in a general that will control the border
[36:53.620 --> 36:57.300]  marine corps general i mean he's delivering delivering but they're already trying to get
[36:57.300 --> 37:02.100]  people to go oh my god we've been betrayed again you know you're not getting betrayed the way the
[37:02.100 --> 37:06.260]  leaders still crap in their pants folks of course he's coming in as a manager and getting people
[37:06.260 --> 37:11.140]  who know how to get stuff done but just like he told roger stone the other day i'm appointing a
[37:11.140 --> 37:14.740]  bunch of golden sacks folks because they were on the show and they got the international connections
[37:14.740 --> 37:18.980]  but these are people like banan who's been anti-new old order for 30 years sure he was
[37:18.980 --> 37:23.940]  acquisitions and mergers that's a whole different arm of a giant company like golden sacks he's
[37:23.940 --> 37:29.060]  there now fighting old man sacks you know it's darth vaders rose palpatine down the damn shaft
[37:29.060 --> 37:33.700]  folks this is how it happens when you start to win a lot of the establishment that didn't like what
[37:33.700 --> 37:38.740]  was happening flips to your side but a lot of these people were always on our side so
[37:38.740 --> 37:43.220]  this is an epic moment they're trying to misrepresent that he's not drain the swamp he should keep
[37:43.220 --> 37:49.140]  the fact drain the swamp keep drain the swamp trump but go out and point out that means get
[37:49.140 --> 37:53.540]  rid of the open border people get rid of the globalists get rid of the bad us attorneys
[37:53.540 --> 37:59.220]  that have been not prosecuting clinton crime machine restore the republic cut the taxes cut
[37:59.220 --> 38:06.340]  the corporate tax to the global average to bring the jobs back these are the litmus test these are
[38:06.340 --> 38:12.180]  the promises that's draining the swamp not oh let me see let me hire somebody who's never been at
[38:12.180 --> 38:18.820]  the top of making let's hire a guy that cuts hair from albuquerque new mexico no no no that's what
[38:18.820 --> 38:22.820]  we're talking about quick comment from all of you on that point yeah he said even when he was
[38:22.820 --> 38:26.740]  campaigning i'm gonna get business people we're gonna run america like a business because of
[38:26.740 --> 38:30.260]  the amount of money that runs through this country it needs to be run like a business there's way
[38:30.260 --> 38:35.860]  too much waste so this is not a lie that you know hiring these type of people is it is not draining
[38:35.860 --> 38:40.180]  the swamp that's a that's fake news right there no no bring our jobs back right getting business
[38:40.180 --> 38:44.340]  people in who know how to run businesses who have bottom lines who are held accountable for their
[38:44.340 --> 38:49.140]  decisions that is all part of this is never been in washington yeah minutia never been in washington
[38:49.140 --> 38:53.300]  so i think you see this is a total lie and who knows maybe game which is part of a disinformation
[38:53.300 --> 38:58.340]  campaign and this is the amazing thing let's remember donald trump was a public figure a successful
[38:58.340 --> 39:04.020]  businessman for decades decades and then what happens when he runs for president he's a racist
[39:04.020 --> 39:09.060]  he's a homophobe he's a xenophobe he's a russian agent all of a sudden right when he starts running
[39:09.060 --> 39:14.100]  you're seeing the same thing now with people like rex tillerson oh well what what i'm sorry
[39:14.100 --> 39:18.180]  most of these people have never even heard of rex tillerson before and oh but now he's a racist
[39:18.180 --> 39:21.060]  he's part of the swamp he's part of the government he's a russian agent and of course he's a russian
[39:21.060 --> 39:27.300]  agent exactly oh the racist doesn't work now you're a russian all right that was alex jones and some
[39:27.300 --> 39:33.300]  of our reporters rob do oh and shawyer talking about what is happening with trump draining the
[39:33.300 --> 39:36.980]  swamp and the trump transition team and of course there's been a lot of discussion everybody
[39:37.620 --> 39:43.060]  trying to read the tea leaves you know is is trump gonna be sincere with his promises it looks like
[39:43.060 --> 39:47.860]  so far he has held to his promises as alex pointed out he's delivered more than we expected
[39:47.860 --> 39:54.420]  uh now we've got uh trump denies gingrich claim that he is dropping the drain the swamp uh
[39:55.140 --> 39:58.980]  he says uh trump tweeted this out he said someone incorrectly stated that the phrase
[39:58.980 --> 40:04.820]  drain the swamp was no longer being used by me actually we will always be trying to drain the
[40:04.820 --> 40:09.700]  swamp so he's pushing back against what newt gingrich said i think when we look at this and we
[40:09.700 --> 40:14.900]  understand that he gave a lot of people a scare when we saw henry kissinger go there are some
[40:14.900 --> 40:18.900]  other people like that but i think he understands that he needs to know who the opposition is he's
[40:18.900 --> 40:24.340]  wise he needs to uh vet that let's give him a chance let's see what's going on meanwhile what about the
[40:24.340 --> 40:30.900]  obama transition team do you think obama is going away absolutely not you see we've always had a
[40:30.900 --> 40:35.860]  tradition in this country where after the president leaves office after either one or two terms
[40:36.500 --> 40:40.980]  then they basically get quiet they don't have anything to say about their predecessor that's
[40:40.980 --> 40:46.500]  something that is held even though there's a radical change from a democrat who's on the far
[40:46.500 --> 40:51.940]  left or republican who is on the far right in both cases they remain quiet about that they
[40:51.940 --> 40:57.700]  don't get involved that is not what obama is going to do and of course we have seen that in the uh
[40:57.700 --> 41:03.540]  after the election we have seen them push back immediately with riots in the streets then they
[41:03.540 --> 41:10.740]  push back with a recount effort that failed all it did was to show that votes in wisconsin had
[41:10.740 --> 41:15.460]  been padded in favor of hillary clinton somebody even said maybe that was jill sign's purpose maybe
[41:15.460 --> 41:19.780]  she's just trying to make hillary clinton look bad showing that she had had people pad the votes for
[41:19.780 --> 41:24.980]  her there just as they rigged the system for her to win the primaries i don't think jill
[41:24.980 --> 41:29.700]  thought it through that much i think it was just self-serving uh to go through that she wanted
[41:29.700 --> 41:35.540]  the publicity she wanted the millions of dollars that she got nevertheless hillary lost a second time
[41:35.540 --> 41:40.500]  and now she's lost a third time this week in the electoral college we had seven electors uh that
[41:40.500 --> 41:44.900]  defected away from hillary clinton we've never seen anything like that we were told by laurence
[41:44.900 --> 41:51.060]  lessing that there was going this is a harvard lawyer who was a political activist he was inciting
[41:51.060 --> 41:56.260]  this promising electors that he would defend them against any criminal charges because of many states
[41:56.260 --> 42:01.060]  what they would be doing what he was inciting people to do was against the law that's a harvard
[42:01.060 --> 42:08.580]  lawyer for you okay so he was trying to uh commit election fraud he was saying to people i will pay
[42:08.580 --> 42:14.580]  your fines we will we will uh represent you and so forth he was saying there were going to be 20
[42:14.580 --> 42:19.780]  electors he said 20 republicans have contacted me said they're seriously considering not voting
[42:19.780 --> 42:26.180]  for donald trump it was two two in texas the guy who was the poster child of all this stuff chris
[42:26.180 --> 42:32.260]  super and the uh stolen valor firefighter apparently and one other person who voted for
[42:33.060 --> 42:38.020]  ron paul here in texas probably because there was so much publicity about this other guy
[42:38.020 --> 42:44.420]  then there were five who voted against hillary clinton so only a tenth of the people that laurence
[42:44.420 --> 42:49.620]  lessing said were going to abandon trump but five people abandoned hillary clinton three of those
[42:49.620 --> 42:54.420]  went to the other party they voted for colin powell we had one person who i vote for bernie
[42:54.420 --> 43:01.860]  sanders we had one other person in washington vote for an indian activist faith spotted eagle
[43:01.860 --> 43:07.300]  and as i tweeted out looks like the faithless elector voted for faith spotted eagle so she
[43:07.300 --> 43:12.020]  gave hillary clinton the bird but that's really kind of a record and now we're seeing something
[43:12.020 --> 43:18.100]  that is also unprecedented as i said earlier in the show every president except for woodrow
[43:18.100 --> 43:23.380]  wilson in this century has left washington woodrow wilson stayed there what was woodrow wilson
[43:23.380 --> 43:30.420]  he was a committed globalist and so is barack obama now he's telling us that he's staying in
[43:30.420 --> 43:37.140]  washington and renting a five point three million dollar mansion which according to zillow ritz for $22,000
[43:37.140 --> 43:41.780]  a month he's saying that he's doing that so that sasha can finish high school but think about the
[43:41.780 --> 43:47.540]  fact that liberals are criticizing donald trump because he wants to let his son baron stay in
[43:47.540 --> 43:52.500]  new york to finish out the school year six months and yet for a year and a half what the obama
[43:52.500 --> 43:57.300]  say that they're going to stay in washington so that sasha can finish high school i don't think so
[43:57.300 --> 44:03.460]  though now he's he's bought this nine bedroom mansion in an upscaled dc neighborhood that's
[44:04.020 --> 44:10.660]  where the embassies and ambassadors residences are typically there but he has plans to lead
[44:10.660 --> 44:16.180]  the opposition against donald trump we've never seen this before in this country certainly not
[44:16.180 --> 44:21.300]  in our lifetime even woodrow wilson didn't do this type of thing and we see his outgoing
[44:21.300 --> 44:26.580]  science advisor john holdren saying that he doesn't think he's going to go anywhere he
[44:26.580 --> 44:31.220]  says on january 20th i will become a private citizen as the president will become and if
[44:31.220 --> 44:35.780]  those initiatives do not go forward in the way that i think that will benefit the nation i will
[44:35.780 --> 44:42.420]  be talking about it so he's going to be pushing this climate change agenda and we're going to have
[44:43.140 --> 44:47.380]  obama working with he's already announced it that he's going to be working
[44:47.380 --> 44:54.420]  with eric holder what are they going to be doing they're going to be suing state legislatures one
[44:54.420 --> 45:01.140]  after the other over redistricting they understand what's involved here we're talking about gerry
[45:01.140 --> 45:06.660]  mandring and both parties do this i remember going back to north carolina when they had a
[45:06.660 --> 45:12.020]  massive sea change there north carolina voted for obama in 2008 two years later they were sick of
[45:12.020 --> 45:19.140]  him so much so that the republicans swept everything in north carolina when i was there in 2010 except
[45:19.140 --> 45:24.820]  for the congressional races there they essentially stayed the same i don't think anybody lost there
[45:24.820 --> 45:29.220]  might have been one change but i don't think so i think they all stayed the same why is that
[45:29.220 --> 45:32.660]  because if you go into gerry mandring of the district you can make something that is very
[45:32.660 --> 45:37.780]  strongly republican or very strongly democrat just by picking who the voters are now the democrats
[45:37.780 --> 45:42.260]  have always done this they do this everywhere but it's in north carolina and it's in republican
[45:42.260 --> 45:47.700]  states that the democrats come in and try to achieve in the court system what they cannot
[45:47.700 --> 45:52.340]  achieve at the ballot box and so that's what they're doing in north carolina i have to say
[45:52.340 --> 45:57.540]  that if they want to stop this jeff sessions and donald trump need to make sure that they
[45:58.100 --> 46:03.060]  change these judges very quickly they need to remove these activist judges that have been put
[46:03.060 --> 46:07.780]  in and put in their own judges at all these lower level courts that's going to be the way
[46:07.780 --> 46:12.980]  that obama and eric holder are going to fight trump in many ways they're going to fight him
[46:12.980 --> 46:18.180]  with these lawsuits at the redistricting level and we see the same type of thing we've got all
[46:18.180 --> 46:21.940]  these reports coming out in north carolina again because there was a very close race between the
[46:21.940 --> 46:28.900]  democrat and republican for governor in north carolina there was a very very heavily democrat
[46:30.260 --> 46:35.780]  area called durham in north carolina they voted like four and a half to one for hillary clinton
[46:36.580 --> 46:41.460]  far more than any other jurisdiction was skewed to either candidate the most i saw in the other
[46:41.460 --> 46:48.180]  ones was maybe 2.6 to trump or to hillary but in durham it was four and a half and a durham
[46:49.060 --> 46:52.980]  went for another hour and a half on election night after everybody else closed and said no
[46:52.980 --> 46:56.260]  we need another hour and a half and we're going to give ourselves another hour and a half to
[46:56.260 --> 47:02.980]  leave the polls open to put this in context north carolina has a longer voting period than any other
[47:02.980 --> 47:09.300]  state in the union they start voting the very first state to start voting and yet that wasn't enough
[47:09.300 --> 47:16.100]  enough and we saw a lot of voting irregularity even the NAACP and democrat group said what happened
[47:16.100 --> 47:21.140]  in durham was a disgrace but they padded that that was the center of the push back and forth
[47:21.700 --> 47:26.340]  between and the governor's race as the it was a legitimate recount there was less than 10 000 votes
[47:26.340 --> 47:31.780]  they're separating the two of them now after the democrat one and the recount by very slim margin
[47:32.420 --> 47:37.060]  the republican legislature said we are going to restrict his capabilities over the state
[47:37.060 --> 47:42.580]  board of elections because it looked like a lot of election fraud there and now then you had cnn
[47:42.580 --> 47:48.980]  and the new york times and all of the usual suspects wailing and moaning about this horrible
[47:48.980 --> 47:53.140]  republican legislature that is eviscerating the powers of the democrat governor in north carolina
[47:53.140 --> 47:57.620]  this is something that happens in all these different states this is kind of tactics that we see
[47:57.620 --> 48:02.660]  to put this in perspective when i was there they had two republican governors prior to the one they
[48:02.660 --> 48:09.460]  have now since reconstruction and when the first one was put in the democrat congress there removed
[48:09.460 --> 48:13.860]  all of his powers all of his powers and then when he left and they got a democrat governor
[48:13.860 --> 48:19.140]  in to replace him they put him back then the second republican governor they got in they cut all of
[48:19.140 --> 48:23.620]  his power as well and then they put it back in again when they got another democrat governor so
[48:23.620 --> 48:29.780]  they pull back just one of these and they may do some more i hope they do some more to pull back
[48:29.780 --> 48:34.740]  and take some of the power away from this democrat governor because i don't trust him
[48:34.740 --> 48:40.260]  however when they do it it's different isn't it and so they're going to fight on the redistricting
[48:40.260 --> 48:43.780]  they're going to fight with these other issues i have an interview that i did yesterday for the
[48:43.780 --> 48:51.780]  monday night nightly news with dr randy scott he's a lifelong dc resident he was at harvard when
[48:51.780 --> 48:57.380]  obama was he's heard him speak he's observed him he didn't go the same college there they were
[48:57.380 --> 49:01.940]  obama was in law school but he had some very interesting comments to talk about how obama
[49:01.940 --> 49:05.540]  is going to become a race leader and of course obama has been going on mp on other places
[49:05.540 --> 49:12.260]  saying that he plans to coach and identify young talent understand this is what they've
[49:12.260 --> 49:18.260]  been doing all along and he's going to stop bombing other countries and he's going to start
[49:18.820 --> 49:24.900]  establishing the youth and pulling up the next generation of leadership following in the footprints
[49:24.900 --> 49:30.820]  of bill ares who did the same thing with the sds when they started the whole white skin privilege
[49:30.820 --> 49:35.940]  movement bill ares stopped bombing buildings and he started getting involved in education
[49:36.500 --> 49:41.700]  and we've seen this all along from obama how he wants to set up youth cores and so forth and
[49:41.700 --> 49:45.460]  he said this to mpr he said there's a lot of things that i'm going to continue to talk about
[49:45.460 --> 49:50.180]  things that i'm passionate about like climate change and criminal justice reform which is
[49:50.180 --> 49:55.860]  codeword there for black lives matter he says all these things are something i think i can do well
[49:56.580 --> 50:02.580]  and i think michelle can do well see he's laying the foundation for michelle running for president
[50:02.580 --> 50:07.300]  in a few years as well i believe so i think that's why they're staying there i think they're pushing
[50:07.300 --> 50:12.500]  on this i've got a clip here that i want to play for you where obama talks about setting up a shadow
[50:12.500 --> 50:16.580]  government of liberal progressives we're going to play that when we come back we don't have enough
[50:16.580 --> 50:25.540]  time for that but in addition as alex mentioned in that clip we've seen criticism for donald trump
[50:25.540 --> 50:29.540]  appointing people that he says are going to reign and out of control bureaucracies like the epa
[50:30.180 --> 50:36.420]  and then also before they put in rick perry they said to the department of energy we want to get a
[50:36.420 --> 50:40.820]  list of people who have been to climate change conferences or written papers and they said
[50:40.820 --> 50:47.060]  this is macartheism well you know what obama fired a top scientist who disagreed with him
[50:47.060 --> 50:56.740]  on climate change yeah that's the double standard say with us we'll be right back
[51:00.420 --> 51:04.180]  in these uncertain times it makes sense to have a sustainable backup method to cook
[51:04.180 --> 51:09.220]  food and boil water if your current plan includes using a fuel burning stove or cooking over an open
[51:09.220 --> 51:14.340]  fire then there's a much better way the minivan rocket stove is a biomass burning cooking stove
[51:14.340 --> 51:19.460]  that only requires small quantities of sticks and twigs for fuel the minivan stove is easy to use
[51:19.460 --> 51:24.260]  smokeless portable powerful and sustainable for the finest in survival cooking stoves and fire
[51:24.260 --> 51:30.500]  starters made right here in the usa go to minivan stove dot com that's minivan stove dot com fully
[51:30.500 --> 51:36.740]  cooked ready to eat bacon i'm talking thick meaty center cut presidential bacon savory and delicious

[56:26.660 --> 56:31.220]  shawyer and of course oan as we've seen who just talked about how eric holder is going to join obama
[56:31.220 --> 56:37.620]  and they're going to get involved in lawsuits to try to overturn districting in the predominantly
[56:37.620 --> 56:41.140]  republican legislatures now throughout the country because they couldn't win at the ballot box so
[56:41.140 --> 56:45.060]  they're going to try to do this in the courtroom but there's lawsuits that are going to be coming
[56:45.060 --> 56:50.580]  up as far as the immigration issue isn't there well we're facing an interesting battle here
[56:50.580 --> 56:56.180]  because you know part of what we like is part of why america what is designed to do to have local
[56:56.180 --> 56:59.940]  governments uh be able to control their own destiny states to be able to control their own
[56:59.940 --> 57:05.060]  destiny uh however there's a very interesting development right now when it comes to the
[57:05.060 --> 57:10.500]  deportation of illegal immigrants especially in these sanctuary cities now everybody knows that
[57:10.500 --> 57:18.020]  trump has planned on cutting the federal money going to these sanctuary cities going to illegal
[57:18.020 --> 57:23.460]  immigrants so what are we now seeing some of the local mayors and some of the local government
[57:23.460 --> 57:30.980]  are basically trying to work their way around that by taking state dollars to represent um
[57:30.980 --> 57:37.300]  illegal immigrants in court a los angeles city and county this is a story from la times
[57:37.300 --> 57:42.100]  los angeles city and county leaders on monday unveiled a ten million dollar fund to provide
[57:42.100 --> 57:47.860]  legal assistance for residents facing deportation using public funds to challenge policies sought
[57:47.860 --> 57:55.060]  by white house and republican congress but guess what david there was no vote the people in la the
[57:55.060 --> 58:00.820]  people in california did not vote on this and i think that this is something that people are
[58:00.820 --> 58:08.020]  going to have to keep their eye on uh because also in california oh and they have amnesty groups
[58:08.020 --> 58:13.940]  who are pleading for them to cover up the data for gang members because they don't want gang members
[58:13.940 --> 58:19.060]  to be deported by donald trump this is insane these are people the very people that should be deported
[58:19.060 --> 58:22.260]  but they want to cover it up they said well you know because they committed a lot of serious
[58:22.260 --> 58:26.820]  crimes they might have been uh falsely labeled as a gang member it's like really who cares if
[58:26.820 --> 58:30.020]  they're in a gang or not if they're committing serious crimes we're gonna be right back with
[58:30.020 --> 58:34.900]  oh and shawry we're gonna talk more about this immigration move it's not stopping folks they
[58:34.900 --> 58:38.820]  are not giving up they are still fighting they're gonna continue to fight in the courts stay with

[59:11.860 --> 59:17.540]  lives off a host mechanism right now with all the refugees uh spreading disease around we have
[59:17.540 --> 59:22.340]  biological warfare going on everywhere these are all parasites tell us about all this episode there's

[01:00:22.340 --> 01:00:26.420]  from the info wars.com studios it's alex jones
[01:00:29.620 --> 01:00:32.660]  welcome back to the alex jones show i'm david night here with oren shawyer and we've been
[01:00:32.660 --> 01:00:38.900]  talking about the continuing push by the obama administration and others they're now going
[01:00:38.900 --> 01:00:45.700]  to fight in the courts to try to keep illegal aliens here and i i think we need to refer to
[01:00:45.700 --> 01:00:50.420]  them not even as undocumented certainly not as undocumented immigrants not even as illegal
[01:00:50.420 --> 01:00:56.180]  aliens i think we need to refer to them as foreign citizens who are here illegally and that's what
[01:00:56.180 --> 01:01:03.540]  we've seen with a mexican ambassador urging mexican citizens to become american citizens saying hey
[01:01:03.540 --> 01:01:07.940]  you can still keep your medic mexican citizenship here and you know a lot of people he says don't
[01:01:07.940 --> 01:01:11.380]  want to get their american citizenship because they don't want to learn english but you know you
[01:01:11.380 --> 01:01:15.620]  you don't have to know english to become an american citizen and you can be a citizen of our country
[01:01:15.620 --> 01:01:21.780]  and export uh our values to america or whatever it is that he wants to do to me i when somebody
[01:01:21.780 --> 01:01:26.340]  is a foreign citizen and they come here illegally i have a big problem with that and i think
[01:01:26.340 --> 01:01:33.540]  this mexican ambassador begging uh these uh 2.6 million as they estimate uh mexican citizens
[01:01:33.540 --> 01:01:38.100]  to become permanent legal residents and citizens here in america i have a problem with that looks
[01:01:38.100 --> 01:01:43.380]  to me like they're trying to take over our our government our value from a foreign government
[01:01:43.380 --> 01:01:48.340]  because this is a mexican ambassador doing this but now you're talking oren about the different
[01:01:48.340 --> 01:01:52.260]  uh jurisdictions the sanctuary city is pushing back against this i mentioned just before we
[01:01:52.260 --> 01:01:57.620]  went to break that california groups who say they're pro amnesty they want to hide the fact that
[01:01:58.340 --> 01:02:01.540]  they're people that have been labeled as criminals as gang members because they don't
[01:02:01.540 --> 01:02:05.460]  want these people deported that's exactly what trump was saying he said we got to get rid of
[01:02:05.460 --> 01:02:11.140]  the worst people and they said you're racist well and look when there was a hearing about this in
[01:02:11.140 --> 01:02:17.940]  los angeles a man from a black vote matter group stepped up to the podium to speak uh in regards
[01:02:17.940 --> 01:02:23.300]  to the local government financing the legal representation for illegal immigrants to avoid
[01:02:23.300 --> 01:02:30.100]  deportation he says well wait a second you know first of all it's complete nonsense that you're
[01:02:30.100 --> 01:02:35.940]  giving this money to non-citizens i think that's what we can call them non-citizens but then secondly
[01:02:35.940 --> 01:02:39.780]  for instance he says they're citizens somewhere they're just not citizens there and it's not like
[01:02:39.780 --> 01:02:43.540]  we can go somewhere else and get this type of help exactly but then he points out he says well
[01:02:43.540 --> 01:02:48.100]  you're you claim that you're doing this because you don't want to break up families you don't
[01:02:48.100 --> 01:02:52.500]  want to put people through these you know hard situations that are just you know with their
[01:02:52.500 --> 01:02:57.860]  family or loved ones or whatever and he comes in and he points out but you have no problem
[01:02:57.860 --> 01:03:02.580]  busting the guy who's selling drugs who's trying to provide for his family you have no problem
[01:03:02.580 --> 01:03:07.060]  invading the house for the guy who's just you know selling whatever illegally to try to provide
[01:03:07.060 --> 01:03:13.300]  for his loved ones who's an american citizen so that's an amazing i think kind of paradox to
[01:03:13.300 --> 01:03:17.140]  look at that these these policies need to you know we understand they want to make things
[01:03:17.140 --> 01:03:21.060]  better for their family but we have a process for that we have a line for that and if they're
[01:03:21.060 --> 01:03:25.620]  going to come in here and become dependent upon us and have us pay for the education of their
[01:03:25.620 --> 01:03:29.700]  children i'm going to lose and many people are going to lose their homes because the property
[01:03:29.700 --> 01:03:34.740]  taxes not going to be able to afford the property taxes if we've got to educate any foreign citizen
[01:03:34.740 --> 01:03:39.620]  children that gets to come here and be educated in the language of their choice you've got some
[01:03:39.620 --> 01:03:43.860]  of these school districts with 80 different languages that they've got to accommodate so i
[01:03:43.860 --> 01:03:48.900]  think people especially in sanctuary cities need to be aware of this here in austin the local mayor
[01:03:48.900 --> 01:03:53.140]  is colluding with president obama to keep syrians coming here despite what the governor said
[01:03:53.140 --> 01:03:57.620]  but this kind of puts it in perspective to me this is how these people think david during his
[01:03:57.620 --> 01:04:03.780]  pledge thursday to protect undocumented immigrants philadelphia major mayor jim tenney a democrat
[01:04:03.780 --> 01:04:08.500]  this is from the washington post cited the fourth amendment saying that it protects being held against
[01:04:08.500 --> 01:04:16.100]  your will without a warrant hey jim in case you didn't realize this they aren't citizens they don't
[01:04:16.100 --> 01:04:23.620]  have a bill of rights they don't have a constitution okay these are american citizens rights you're
[01:04:23.620 --> 01:04:31.540]  citing a document for american citizens to protect a non-citizen david this logic that completely
[01:04:31.540 --> 01:04:35.940]  befuddles them goes over their head is the most frustrating thing to me honestly it makes me want
[01:04:35.940 --> 01:04:40.340]  to go to law school so i can explain this to people and they'll actually wait oh oh you have a law
[01:04:40.340 --> 01:04:45.700]  degree oh whoa oh now i have to listen he should take that fourth amendment to the tsa at the airports
[01:04:45.700 --> 01:04:50.260]  and all of you who are traveling to mine then that's right it's a dead letter as far as they're
[01:04:50.260 --> 01:04:54.660]  concerned stay with us you're gonna be right back with stefan malinu very interesting discussion
[01:04:54.660 --> 01:05:03.300]  coming up stay with us we're learning more than ever about the tunisian asylum seeker wanted in
[01:05:03.300 --> 01:05:07.940]  the berlin massacre he was jailed for four years in italy for burning down a school and arrested
[01:05:07.940 --> 01:05:14.180]  three separate times in germany before police quote lost him anis army was also on the us no fly
[01:05:14.180 --> 01:05:18.900]  list and he settled in italy after leaving his hometown in tunisia now his father claimed this
[01:05:18.900 --> 01:05:24.180]  in a radio interview there's currently a reward on his head 100 000 euro he spent four years in
[01:05:24.180 --> 01:05:29.620]  an italian jail for burning down a school before he left for germany last year the 23 year old was
[01:05:29.620 --> 01:05:34.500]  arrested three times but authorities allowed him to slip through the cracks even though he had been
[01:05:34.500 --> 01:05:40.260]  identified as an isis supporter and had received weapons training apparently security forces exchanged
[01:05:40.260 --> 01:05:46.260]  information as recently as last month about army and his ties to the islamic state as reported by
[01:05:46.260 --> 01:05:50.820]  fox news it still didn't stop officials from detaining him they wouldn't kick him out of the
[01:05:50.820 --> 01:05:56.740]  country and he was allowed to ultimately wreak havoc in berlin killing 12 people and injuring 50

[01:08:24.260 --> 01:08:28.100]  welcome back to the alex jones show i'm david night your host we're going to be joined in just a
[01:08:28.100 --> 01:08:34.260]  moment by stefan malinu before we do i want to read you this article and i think stefan will
[01:08:34.260 --> 01:08:39.140]  appreciate this and have something to say about this uh writers put out a little thing they call
[01:08:39.140 --> 01:08:44.020]  a data dive when they looked at some statistics and some polls they said if there's a war on christmas
[01:08:44.020 --> 01:08:49.380]  christmas is winning they say christmas isn't just for christians anymore they said some 81%
[01:08:49.380 --> 01:08:57.300]  of non christians in the u.s celebrate the holiday that 76% of asian american budists 73% of hindus
[01:08:57.300 --> 01:09:03.860]  even 32% of us jews have a christmas tree in their home and they said turns out 44% of americans
[01:09:03.860 --> 01:09:08.020]  say christian symbols like nativity scenes should be allowed on government property
[01:09:08.020 --> 01:09:12.500]  even if they're not accompanied by symbols from other religions and when they ask them
[01:09:12.500 --> 01:09:17.300]  whether they want to say merry christmas or happy holidays they said 42% of americans prefer
[01:09:17.300 --> 01:09:23.860]  merry christmas 12% happy holidays 46% chose i don't care it doesn't matter but i said when
[01:09:23.860 --> 01:09:30.260]  they took out the doesn't matter it came out 57% said they preferred merry christmas 27% said happy
[01:09:30.260 --> 01:09:37.860]  holidays okay so this is the this is the world that we live in the paranoia of the left about christmas
[01:09:37.860 --> 01:09:42.340]  and i kind of say on the christian side i know a lot of christians who don't like christmas they
[01:09:42.340 --> 01:09:48.580]  don't want to celebrate they don't like the uh the synchronicity of uh you know the pagan symbols
[01:09:48.580 --> 01:09:53.300]  of santa claus everything with it and some people on the christian side said hey uh we don't know
[01:09:53.300 --> 01:09:57.620]  when jesus was born we're not going to celebrate it on that day and so forth and so there's opinions
[01:09:57.620 --> 01:10:03.540]  on both sides of this and yet you've got the left going absolutely crazy trying to censor it in every
[01:10:03.540 --> 01:10:11.540]  possible way but upholding islam which is the very manifestation of church and state joined
[01:10:11.540 --> 01:10:16.260]  together at the hip that's their goal the caliphate's the sharia law we had hillary clinton having
[01:10:16.260 --> 01:10:21.220]  sharia khan introduced her at the democrat convention uh the guy who was a muslim and he'd
[01:10:21.220 --> 01:10:25.940]  written extensively about sharia law and advocate of that so i want to get stuff on malinu's comments
[01:10:25.940 --> 01:10:31.380]  on this and of course he's the founder and host of free domain radio largest most popular philosophical
[01:10:31.380 --> 01:10:36.980]  show in the world you'll find it at free domain radio dot com you can also find him on youtube at

[01:10:43.060 --> 01:10:48.980]  us stefan thanks david nice to be with you again so i'll wish you a merry christmas even though
[01:10:48.980 --> 01:10:54.020]  merry christmas to you as well yes yes i mean isn't this amazing the things that we have seen
[01:10:54.020 --> 01:10:58.340]  this last week and and and the very disturbing video we talked about this yesterday in alex
[01:10:58.340 --> 01:11:04.820]  jones show of this mother who was preparing her seven-year-old and nine-year-old girls and and
[01:11:04.820 --> 01:11:10.180]  she's clothes top you know head to head to toe in a burka you can't see anything about this so
[01:11:10.180 --> 01:11:16.180]  there's this dark figure shrouded in in black giving her blessing to these girls and then
[01:11:16.820 --> 01:11:21.140]  one of these girls goes off and they remotely controlled a uh there was a seven-year-old girl
[01:11:21.140 --> 01:11:26.340]  they think it was one of the two that was in this video they have a remote control suicide bomb
[01:11:26.340 --> 01:11:33.220]  that kills three people in a police station i mean this is a cult of death isn't it well of
[01:11:33.220 --> 01:11:37.700]  course this is the uh the great challenge that is occurring in the west at the moment and the
[01:11:37.700 --> 01:11:42.580]  governments of course are supposed to be charged with protecting citizens and to some degree that
[01:11:42.580 --> 01:11:47.460]  means protecting demographics there are countries many countries throughout the world that would
[01:11:47.460 --> 01:11:51.540]  consider it a significant act of treason to fundamentally change the demographics of the
[01:11:51.540 --> 01:11:56.820]  country and of course you don't see lots of social justice warriors screaming at china or south
[01:11:56.820 --> 01:12:03.700]  korea or japan to to bring in alternative ideologies and ethnicities in um in mexico there's actually
[01:12:03.700 --> 01:12:08.020]  written into the constitution that no law should be passed to fundamentally alter the demographics
[01:12:08.020 --> 01:12:14.180]  of the country and of course since 1965 that has been the goal of the elites throughout the west
[01:12:14.180 --> 01:12:18.980]  and i think that the blowback is starting to manifest uh it seems almost daily these days
[01:12:18.980 --> 01:12:23.700]  yeah and and then we see people like gert wilders who speaks out he was convicted
[01:12:24.580 --> 01:12:28.820]  in a show trial a politically motivated show trial that he had a political rally he said would
[01:12:28.820 --> 01:12:35.620]  you like to see more or fewer morocans and the crowd says uh less you know fewer and so they
[01:12:35.620 --> 01:12:39.460]  said that's hate speech you're inciting that against a group and that's racism he says well
[01:12:39.460 --> 01:12:44.900]  morocans are not a race uh islam is not a race or whatever he said this is a discussion about
[01:12:44.900 --> 01:12:49.940]  immigration policy and then at the same time we see this article that's on info wars today
[01:12:49.940 --> 01:12:55.540]  just 2.8 percent of the 1.2 million migrants that have been brought in by angola merkel and the
[01:12:55.540 --> 01:13:00.500]  german government even have jobs so this is well and then who's to who's to say whether those are
[01:13:00.500 --> 01:13:07.140]  real jobs yeah or not and in here you see with gert wilders it is a policy question it is a policy
[01:13:07.140 --> 01:13:13.140]  question in a democracy and then it suddenly becomes hate speech if you look at the the
[01:13:13.140 --> 01:13:19.140]  statistics for criminality by morocans in his home country it is let's just say not entirely in line
[01:13:19.140 --> 01:13:25.220]  with the rest of the population so here we have a politician in a democracy asking for feedback
[01:13:25.220 --> 01:13:30.900]  from the population on policy proposals that is labeled as hate speech and that of course for
[01:13:30.900 --> 01:13:36.420]  anybody who's interested in democracy or any kind of sensitivity of politicians to the wishes of the
[01:13:36.420 --> 01:13:41.220]  people that would be a huge concern but of course the elites are interested in that surely it would
[01:13:41.220 --> 01:13:47.060]  be something you would put to a referendum something like immigration and changing demographics and
[01:13:47.060 --> 01:13:51.460]  bringing ideologies that have had some certain problems when they've gone into other countries
[01:13:51.460 --> 01:13:55.620]  throughout the world surely that would be something you would put to a referendum but of course the
[01:13:55.620 --> 01:14:01.860]  left is no more interested in democracy or in listening to the people than they are interested
[01:14:01.860 --> 01:14:05.700]  fundamentally in gay rights or women's rights or whatever as we can see from the kind of groups
[01:14:05.700 --> 01:14:11.460]  that they aligned themselves with. Exactly and as we look at this story further they had Joaquin
[01:14:11.460 --> 01:14:16.260]  Muller who's director of the IAB in Germany said if we get 50% of these immigrants coming in get a
[01:14:16.260 --> 01:14:21.460]  job that would be a huge success I mean they're not looking I mean that would be 600,000 immigrants
[01:14:21.460 --> 01:14:26.020]  coming in that are still living off of the government living off of the taxpayer but there's no way
[01:14:26.020 --> 01:14:30.180]  they're going to get 50% as it says on the article here it'd be an illusion to believe that even 5%
[01:14:30.180 --> 01:14:36.980]  of them would get jobs so back in July they said 55 out of 1 million had gotten jobs and 50 of those
[01:14:36.980 --> 01:14:41.620]  jobs were working at the post office. Here's what you said right there that they're not real jobs
[01:14:41.620 --> 01:14:46.900]  I mean we're not talking about 55,000 out of a million we're not talking about 550 out of a
[01:14:46.900 --> 01:14:53.540]  million we're talking about 55 and 50 of those are at the post office. Well here's the basic
[01:14:53.540 --> 01:14:59.780]  way that I look at it David it goes sort of something like this either these people are
[01:14:59.780 --> 01:15:04.980]  the people coming in from the Middle East and so on they're highly competent very intelligent
[01:15:04.980 --> 01:15:09.540]  very easily able to learn the host countries language and cultures and customs and willing
[01:15:09.540 --> 01:15:13.940]  to integrate and willing to work and so on in which has very very high quality people
[01:15:13.940 --> 01:15:19.860]  that are being removed from the host countries that at some point will need to be rebuilt.
[01:15:19.860 --> 01:15:23.380]  At some point these conflicts are going to de-escalate and of course a lot of the migrants
[01:15:23.380 --> 01:15:27.940]  aren't even coming from war-torn countries or countries with rebellions or revolutions
[01:15:27.940 --> 01:15:33.300]  so at some point these countries are going to need to be rebuilt. Now if we are taking all of
[01:15:33.300 --> 01:15:37.380]  the best and brightest out of these countries and moving them to Europe what that means is that
[01:15:37.380 --> 01:15:42.100]  there are that many fewer people who are able to rebuild the countries afterwards which is only
[01:15:42.100 --> 01:15:47.780]  going to exacerbate the conflicts and the hostilities and so that's one possibility let's say that
[01:15:47.780 --> 01:15:52.980]  half of these people do get jobs well what that means is that you have hundreds of thousands
[01:15:52.980 --> 01:15:57.780]  of people suddenly entering a marketplace in the west and what is that going to do when you
[01:15:57.780 --> 01:16:02.740]  have an oversupply of labor it drives down the price of labor and what that means is it becomes
[01:16:02.740 --> 01:16:09.380]  less valuable to have a job and more valuable to be on welfare. So this is all very very fundamental
[01:16:09.380 --> 01:16:13.540]  to understand and nobody's thinking about it at least at the elite level in the long run
[01:16:13.540 --> 01:16:19.540]  and fundamentally and finally if you want to help people in the Middle East and I have for many years
[01:16:19.540 --> 01:16:24.740]  railed against the untold evils of meddling in foreign affairs of foreign countries of course
[01:16:24.740 --> 01:16:29.700]  domestic affairs of foreign countries invasions and manipulations of elections and all the stuff
[01:16:29.700 --> 01:16:34.820]  that's been going on from the west for decade upon decade has been brutal and has resulted in the
[01:16:34.820 --> 01:16:39.300]  deaths of millions of people in the Middle East primarily Muslims the body count from the west
[01:16:39.300 --> 01:16:45.700]  towards Islam is much higher in terms of the victims of western imperialism but we want to
[01:16:45.700 --> 01:16:50.740]  help people in the Middle East fantastic then what we do is we send money over to help resettle them
[01:16:50.740 --> 01:16:55.700]  in the Middle East you can help 12 people to resettle in the Middle East for exactly the same
[01:16:55.700 --> 01:17:00.180]  money you spend to bring one person into the west and in the Middle East they have of course the
[01:17:00.180 --> 01:17:04.420]  same religion they have the same culture they have the same customs they have similar languages
[01:17:04.420 --> 01:17:08.020]  and so on again I'm not going to say they're all the same but it's certainly more similar
[01:17:08.020 --> 01:17:12.980]  than it is between the Middle East and Germany or France so if you want to help people help them
[01:17:12.980 --> 01:17:16.900]  where they live and don't take all the best and brightest out of the countries which is only
[01:17:16.900 --> 01:17:22.260]  going to exacerbate continuing tensions into the future and as you said rather than creating all
[01:17:22.260 --> 01:17:26.660]  these regime changes which have been disasters in Libya and in Syria when I look at all the
[01:17:26.660 --> 01:17:32.500]  the catastrophe in Aleppo and people get angry about it they want to blame the Syrians and the
[01:17:32.500 --> 01:17:37.860]  Russians or they want to blame ISIS or whatever it's like understand that ISIS was our surrogate
[01:17:37.860 --> 01:17:43.700]  to do a regime change in Syria and just like Madeleine Albright who when she was asked was
[01:17:43.700 --> 01:17:49.380]  the death of a half a million children because of your actions was that worth it she didn't
[01:17:49.380 --> 01:17:54.820]  dispute that they had died she said yeah it was worth it we don't really care about what happens
[01:17:54.820 --> 01:17:58.820]  to these people so you want to talk about the Aleppo boy we'll talk about the half a million
[01:17:58.820 --> 01:18:03.700]  children's whose faces you did not see that Madeleine Albright destroyed and then that Hillary
[01:18:03.700 --> 01:18:09.140]  Clinton created this Aleppo situation so if we really want to help the people you're right Stefan
[01:18:09.140 --> 01:18:14.980]  we we stop the wars that we have created in those countries and we allow them to rebuild
[01:18:14.980 --> 01:18:20.500]  their countries with their people and just just stop the regime change that we're doing but
[01:18:20.500 --> 01:18:25.700]  they're not going to do that they're going to continue to use ISIS as our surrogate in that
[01:18:25.700 --> 01:18:30.580]  area to overthrow the Syrian government there and create this catastrophe that we've seen.
[01:18:31.300 --> 01:18:34.820]  Oh and if you ever really want to break your heart and I think it is a useful thing a useful
[01:18:34.820 --> 01:18:43.220]  exercise for people to do go on the internet and look up pictures of say Iraq or Iran in the 1950s
[01:18:43.220 --> 01:18:47.940]  and the 1960s you see women in bikinis you see women going to colleges you see all these kinds
[01:18:47.940 --> 01:18:53.140]  of wonderful things it's so important to understand the view of the empire from outside the empire
[01:18:53.140 --> 01:18:57.460]  is radically different you know the Death Star from the inside looks like a disco but from the
[01:18:57.460 --> 01:19:03.540]  outside we see it for what it is and so there's so many things that go on in the west the propping
[01:19:03.540 --> 01:19:09.060]  up of dictatorial regimes around the world the selling of arms is a huge issue around the world
[01:19:09.060 --> 01:19:12.340]  you can't say well we need a national defense because the world is a dangerous place and then
[01:19:12.340 --> 01:19:16.260]  go around being the biggest arms dealer in the world arming everyone and their dog I mean you
[01:19:16.260 --> 01:19:21.620]  can it's just a horribly hypocritical position to be in and of course there are drone strikes there
[01:19:21.620 --> 01:19:26.420]  are massive bombings that that have occurred in Iraq as well I did a presentation called
[01:19:26.420 --> 01:19:31.300]  Iraq a decade of hell where I traced just how much was destroyed in Iraq as a result of an
[01:19:31.300 --> 01:19:38.180]  extremely misguided if not downright falsely motivated invasion the invade everyone invite
[01:19:38.180 --> 01:19:44.100]  everyone equation is going to result in I think untold suffering around the world and we're already
[01:19:44.100 --> 01:19:48.420]  seeing it happening throughout Europe in the Riviera in the German Christmas market but the
[01:19:48.420 --> 01:19:53.380]  Washington Post says this refugee crisis could actually be a boon for Germany you know 55 jobs

[01:25:43.700 --> 01:25:49.940]  combat the bacteria in your mouth let's go back to stefan molyneux stefan you know we're talking
[01:25:49.940 --> 01:25:57.460]  about the immigration issues we we look at the uh this attack that happened in germany this last
[01:25:57.460 --> 01:26:01.780]  year and as you're pointing out there's a lot of people who are very valuable to their country
[01:26:01.780 --> 01:26:08.980]  who are going to be needed when we stop fomenting the wars in those countries and yet um we're not
[01:26:08.980 --> 01:26:14.500]  able to vet the people who come in and when i look at the situation in germany they're talking
[01:26:14.500 --> 01:26:19.300]  about how this individual was someone who was known to them he was tracked by them even after he got
[01:26:19.300 --> 01:26:24.580]  into the country so they didn't vet him to let him in but even after he got into europe uh they knew
[01:26:24.580 --> 01:26:29.380]  that he had multiple identity documents he'd spent four years in italian prison for crimes there
[01:26:29.380 --> 01:26:34.100]  finally they let him go to germany they tried to deport him in june and then the weak and
[01:26:34.100 --> 01:26:40.340]  ineffective government in germany could not get this guy either in prison or send him out even
[01:26:40.340 --> 01:26:45.060]  though he'd been found trying to purchase automatic weapons i mean this this is absolutely insane
[01:26:45.060 --> 01:26:50.900]  their response is to try to step up gun control in the e-u even though he used a truck so i guess
[01:26:50.900 --> 01:26:56.660]  they can't tell the difference between a semi-trailer and a semi-automatic well it is it is of course
[01:26:56.660 --> 01:27:02.820]  desperately tragic what is happening in europe and to me it comes down to the fact that the left
[01:27:02.820 --> 01:27:08.340]  has really lost the argument in terms of empirical data and of course with the rise of the internet
[01:27:08.340 --> 01:27:12.740]  they're losing the argument because beforehand through academia and through the mainstream media
[01:27:12.740 --> 01:27:18.260]  you had a lot of filters to keep conservative or pro-christian or pro-free market or small
[01:27:18.260 --> 01:27:23.780]  government or libertarian perspectives away from the masses and of course that was exactly what
[01:27:23.780 --> 01:27:29.140]  the leftists wanted they are not very good at debating i have spent oh about three decades
[01:27:29.140 --> 01:27:34.100]  plus debating leftists and they're really not very good which is why they escalate to hysterical
[01:27:34.100 --> 01:27:38.340]  verbal abuse to attacks to going after your source of income to try to get you fired and
[01:27:38.340 --> 01:27:43.700]  they can't win an argument but they desperately want their particular vision to take root now in
[01:27:43.700 --> 01:27:48.900]  a democracy you do have to even in a republic you have to win arguments in order to be able
[01:27:48.900 --> 01:27:55.060]  to enact policy unless you can change the demographics of the country into a more leftist
[01:27:55.060 --> 01:27:59.620]  friendly or large government friendly demographic and of course hispanics and muslims and so on
[01:27:59.620 --> 01:28:04.260]  have a historical tendency to vote significantly for the left you'd think of course that the
[01:28:04.260 --> 01:28:10.180]  hispanics in california who were given amnesty by ronald reagan in one of the catastrophic
[01:28:10.180 --> 01:28:14.980]  decisions i would argue of his presidency that they would say wow thanks republicans you have
[01:28:14.980 --> 01:28:19.220]  our loyalty for just a little while but no in general the vast majority of hispanics are going
[01:28:19.220 --> 01:28:24.020]  to vote left and so they want to change the demographics because they can't win the argument
[01:28:24.020 --> 01:28:28.740]  and they can't win the argument because socialism fails everywhere it has been tried collectivism
[01:28:28.740 --> 01:28:33.140]  fails everywhere it has been tried well i shouldn't say it wins in the short run it's kind of like
[01:28:33.140 --> 01:28:38.820]  cocaine i'm happy oh wait i'm broke and so people need to go to venezuela to see how that works out
[01:28:38.820 --> 01:28:43.460]  you know the people who do not understand the concept of lines you can go to venezuela and you
[01:28:43.460 --> 01:28:46.740]  can get in line for everything and then when you get up to the front you'll find out they don't
[01:28:46.740 --> 01:28:50.340]  have it after you've been waiting in line there but you said something that was very interesting
[01:28:50.340 --> 01:28:54.740]  at the beginning of this you talked about how they they kept all these issues away from us i
[01:28:54.740 --> 01:29:01.780]  remember a time when there was no dispute between real news and fake news you had three mainstream
[01:29:02.660 --> 01:29:08.020]  cbs mbc c you know and they and they were putting out this narrative that was unified they would
[01:29:08.020 --> 01:29:12.580]  cover the same stories tell you the same things about those same stories and coincidentally it
[01:29:12.580 --> 01:29:17.780]  was the same thing the government was saying at the same time they don't like to have a situation
[01:29:17.780 --> 01:29:22.100]  where people have to use their minds to distinguish between real news and fake news
[01:29:22.100 --> 01:29:26.980]  and snowden himself came out and said you know you really don't want the government being the
[01:29:26.980 --> 01:29:33.380]  arbiter of what true news is it's much better if you used your own mind boy what words of wisdom
[01:29:33.380 --> 01:29:36.820]  we're going to be right back with stefan malinu and we're going to talk a little bit about fiat
[01:29:36.820 --> 01:29:44.180]  currency because again this is the anniversary of the federal reserve being created 103 years ago
[01:29:44.180 --> 01:29:48.820]  that's the epitome of this and that's how they get their power through the central bank stay
[01:29:48.820 --> 01:29:55.700]  with us we'll be right back we're on the march the empires on the run alex jones and the gcn radio
[01:29:55.700 --> 01:30:04.260]  network an alarming report coming out of campus reform that talks about how muslim students
[01:30:04.260 --> 01:30:09.700]  are demanding prayer rooms in every major building now students at the university of maryland they've
[01:30:09.700 --> 01:30:15.460]  released a list of 64 of their demands all in an effort to make their campus quote more amenable
[01:30:15.460 --> 01:30:22.180]  this project it's known as protect umd it's an effort between 25 different student organizations
[01:30:22.180 --> 01:30:27.860]  at the university of maryland this news is coming just after the ohio state attack where we saw one
[01:30:27.860 --> 01:30:32.900]  muslim student who felt marginalized he actually took out his frustration and plowed into a crowd
[01:30:32.900 --> 01:30:37.780]  of students and then began stabbing them millie weaver took to the streets on ohio state's campus
[01:30:37.780 --> 01:30:43.140]  shortly after and so did rebel media and they asked students why they thought that this one muslim
[01:30:43.140 --> 01:30:48.740]  student in particular decided to quote act out and surprisingly students said that he probably felt
[01:30:48.740 --> 01:30:52.900]  marginalized so it looks like the university of maryland is tackling that and they're going to
[01:30:52.900 --> 01:30:57.780]  allow students to have prayer rooms now in every major building but only if you're muslim i'm margaret

[01:33:35.860 --> 01:33:42.580]  at stephan malinu stephan one of your favorite topics is fiat currency in a course it was 103
[01:33:42.580 --> 01:33:50.900]  years ago today while much of the congress was gone that they put through the federal reserve act
[01:33:50.900 --> 01:33:56.980]  and as i said before it's the gift to the global elite that just keeps on giving here we are
[01:33:56.980 --> 01:34:01.780]  103 years after the fact let's talk a little bit about fiat currency and and what we can do with
[01:34:01.780 --> 01:34:07.700]  it of course the first thing that we would love to see is for a president trump to audit the fed
[01:34:07.700 --> 01:34:12.980]  and ask them some uncomfortable questions as we saw the questioning the uncomfortable questioning
[01:34:12.980 --> 01:34:18.100]  of alan grason with the inspector general that was charged with oversight of the fed she couldn't
[01:34:18.100 --> 01:34:22.900]  answer where nine trillion dollars went uh sorry we can't look at that and then there's another
[01:34:22.900 --> 01:34:27.300]  trillion dollars that's uh not accounted for on the books of the federal reserve but let's
[01:34:27.300 --> 01:34:31.140]  you know ten trillion dollars here they're amongst friends who cares about that right
[01:34:31.140 --> 01:34:37.220]  this is the global scam that gives them their power isn't it this is the greatest tragedy
[01:34:37.220 --> 01:34:42.180]  of the 20th century was the abandonment of gold backed and silver backed currency now
[01:34:42.180 --> 01:34:46.260]  whether that would be replaced in a free society with some form of electronic currency i'm sure
[01:34:46.260 --> 01:34:51.140]  that they would exist sort of side by side but it's really really important for people to understand
[01:34:51.140 --> 01:34:56.500]  that governments tend to abandon their limits on currency right they tend to abandon a gold
[01:34:56.500 --> 01:35:01.700]  standard when they wish to either bribe you or get you killed it is really that simple and of
[01:35:01.700 --> 01:35:05.540]  course in many ways bribing you is just deferring the day of reckoning so of course in the first
[01:35:05.540 --> 01:35:10.340]  world war the western powers abandoned the gold standard because otherwise they would have had
[01:35:10.340 --> 01:35:14.180]  to end the war because they ran out of gold so they had to switch to paper currency they had to
[01:35:14.180 --> 01:35:19.940]  switch to fear currency in order to continue the mass slaughterhouse of the western front and of
[01:35:19.940 --> 01:35:25.780]  course the eastern front as well so this is really important it is and we saw that in civil war too
[01:35:25.780 --> 01:35:29.860]  we saw that in civil war we had both the north and the south have to go to paper currency in order
[01:35:29.860 --> 01:35:34.180]  to get through uh and that was the first time we had a fiat currency in the united states was uh
[01:35:34.180 --> 01:35:38.660]  lincoln's greenbacks so they always like as you point out they run out of gold so they can keep
[01:35:38.660 --> 01:35:43.220]  out the killing going they go to a fiat currency and start printing up paper money right and what
[01:35:43.220 --> 01:35:49.380]  it does is it drugs people as to the economic consequences of what is going on in terms of
[01:35:49.380 --> 01:35:53.540]  the promises so the government will promise you a whole bunch of stuff and then as we can see in
[01:35:53.540 --> 01:35:58.500]  venezuela when they don't have the money to pay for all the stuff that they promised they just start
[01:35:58.500 --> 01:36:02.740]  printing more money and then they start restricting private ownership of gold because they want to
[01:36:02.740 --> 01:36:07.940]  scoop it up or at least manage it in the society and that fundamentally destroys your freedom um
[01:36:07.940 --> 01:36:12.740]  that there's a story of course i've read as many people have in the weimar republic of a man who
[01:36:12.740 --> 01:36:17.300]  took his life savings cashed them in during the hyperinflation and took the wheelbarrow of money
[01:36:17.300 --> 01:36:22.020]  across the street and was able to buy a cup of coffee with everything so his entire life savings
[01:36:22.020 --> 01:36:27.060]  have been stripped from him it is a form of absolutely sinister and subterranean theft
[01:36:27.060 --> 01:36:33.300]  and it allows the governments to pretend that the insane equations of unfunded liabilities that i
[01:36:33.300 --> 01:36:39.060]  think of the us are running north of 150 trillion dollars or 10 times the entire gdp of the country
[01:36:39.060 --> 01:36:43.220]  it allows them to kick the can down the road a little bit more and it allows them to give you
[01:36:43.220 --> 01:36:48.100]  the illusion of something for nothing that fundamentally subverts democracy in democracy
[01:36:48.100 --> 01:36:52.420]  you can vote on things but the consequences of what you vote on should accrue to you particularly
[01:36:52.420 --> 01:36:57.380]  if you're a taxpayer but if you can vote for free stuff and have the uh the bills flow down to the
[01:36:57.380 --> 01:37:02.180]  next generation uh that is intergenerational theft that is a Ponzi scheme and this fundamentally
[01:37:02.180 --> 01:37:06.420]  counter to the rational decisions that need to be made with scarce resources in society
[01:37:06.420 --> 01:37:10.660]  and of course you're talking about that uh that famous situation of the Weimar Republic where he's
[01:37:10.660 --> 01:37:15.220]  got the wheelbarrow full of cash we're seeing that happening now in Venezuela we've got people
[01:37:15.220 --> 01:37:19.700]  that are having to go from one ATM to the other because the ATMs don't have enough cash so they
[01:37:19.700 --> 01:37:24.340]  can get basic groceries but then of course there's not any groceries in the stores at the same time
[01:37:24.900 --> 01:37:30.340]  that's the pattern that this always goes down and of course uh you know we've seen this play out
[01:37:30.340 --> 01:37:34.340]  over and over again there's not much coverage of what's going on in Venezuela
[01:37:34.340 --> 01:37:40.100]  absolute total chaos they have taken control as we saw in Venezuela first they took control
[01:37:40.100 --> 01:37:43.700]  of a lot of private resources of foreign oil companies and everybody said oh that's great
[01:37:43.700 --> 01:37:47.860]  because these are big companies we're fine with that but then they ultimately turned that over to
[01:37:47.860 --> 01:37:52.580]  themselves and that's essentially what we see going on in a larger scale with the IMF and these
[01:37:52.580 --> 01:37:57.300]  other things they're trying to do what was called rent seeking we had the rebuilding of countries
[01:37:57.300 --> 01:38:04.660]  after World War II with the Marshall Plan but then when uh in the 1960s the IMF started going in
[01:38:04.660 --> 01:38:10.340]  and started making loans to these countries to create welfare programs that they could never pay
[01:38:10.340 --> 01:38:16.100]  back and so they get they turn them into renters they take over possession of their country which
[01:38:16.100 --> 01:38:20.820]  is what's happening in our country as well everything that they print is a debt to the American
[01:38:20.820 --> 01:38:25.060]  consumer and so we're just going further and further into debt to this small private cabal
[01:38:25.060 --> 01:38:31.460]  well here is the I think the real hypocrisy of the media and no the legacy media as it sometimes
[01:38:31.460 --> 01:38:36.660]  called which is not not hard to see but where it's invisible it's worth shining a light on it
[01:38:36.660 --> 01:38:41.620]  because the mainstream media is not talking much about Venezuela as you point out David and the
[01:38:41.620 --> 01:38:47.780]  reason for that is that the mainstream media was very very keen on one Hugo Chavez when he got into
[01:38:47.780 --> 01:38:52.660]  power and they thought he was doing wonderful things with nationalization and with growing the
[01:38:52.660 --> 01:38:56.980]  government and expanding the civil service and making all of these promises to all of these people
[01:38:56.980 --> 01:39:00.180]  about everything he was going to do for them because I don't know if leftists live in this
[01:39:00.180 --> 01:39:04.820]  magical fantasy land where resources rain from trees you know like the way that baby food gets
[01:39:04.820 --> 01:39:09.700]  scooped into your face when you're a toddler but because they were also pro Hugo Chavez and they
[01:39:09.700 --> 01:39:16.100]  have mounted a multi-decade propaganda against uh Augustus Pinochet of Chile and you've seen endless
[01:39:16.100 --> 01:39:20.740]  endless uh no he was a military dictator however he did have some very good free market reforms
[01:39:20.740 --> 01:39:25.860]  which is why Chile is doing very well relative to Venezuela so once more they claim to care about
[01:39:25.860 --> 01:39:31.140]  the poor and they're demonizing a man who helped bring Chile into the 21st century economically
[01:39:31.140 --> 01:39:37.700]  and they're covering up the crimes of Hugo Chavez who has helped to destroy a once prosperous nation
[01:39:37.700 --> 01:39:43.220]  and as if uh the socialists don't have militarized governments as well you know that that you talk
[01:39:43.220 --> 01:39:48.260]  about yeah Pinochet's militarized but look the economy prospered there so that you know that
[01:39:48.260 --> 01:39:52.900]  the militarization is kind of a wash because both sides are doing that but we saw that happen with
[01:39:52.900 --> 01:39:57.380]  Bernie Sanders and remember that clip that was 30-some-odd years old where he was just gushing
[01:39:57.380 --> 01:40:03.060]  with enthusiasm about the Nick Rogwin Sandernistas and I used to call him Bernie Sandernista because
[01:40:03.060 --> 01:40:08.340]  he never never disowned those people you you know he actually praised these people we had the
[01:40:08.340 --> 01:40:12.420]  people come after Donald Trump about Ku Klux Klan because a Ku Klux Klan guy said hey I like
[01:40:12.420 --> 01:40:15.940]  Donald Trump it's like disavow him disavow him and no matter how many times he would do it they
[01:40:15.940 --> 01:40:20.900]  would keep coming back at him but nobody ever asked Bernie Sanders to disavow the Sandernistas
[01:40:20.900 --> 01:40:25.140]  and the communists and the policies that he endorsed that we've seen now come to fruition
[01:40:25.140 --> 01:40:31.380]  in Venezuela and he never did well of course uh Trump has to repeatedly disavow a guy he's barely
[01:40:31.380 --> 01:40:35.780]  heard of yeah uh who's uh you know uh considered to be someone oh he was part of the KKK at one
[01:40:35.780 --> 01:40:40.100]  point however of course the fact that the head of the communist party in america seemed to be
[01:40:40.100 --> 01:40:44.980]  enormously keen on Hillary Clinton and I would guess I think that the death count of the KKK
[01:40:44.980 --> 01:40:49.780]  was a couple of thousand people tragic enough look at that compared to the death count of
[01:40:50.420 --> 01:40:55.860]  worldwide communism yeah and the idea that the only person you focus on is is David Duke rather than
[01:40:56.580 --> 01:41:01.860]  the the communist party as a whole again it just shows you the in-group preference and the sort of
[01:41:01.860 --> 01:41:06.740]  very Russoian noble savage primitive tribalism which to me is what the left fundamentally
[01:41:06.740 --> 01:41:10.980]  represents they came to be progressive but every solution they have is going back to coercive
[01:41:10.980 --> 01:41:16.100]  tribalism just shows you again the hypocrisy and that's the beautiful thing that alternative media
[01:41:16.100 --> 01:41:21.220]  is doing soon to be the mainstream media is it is disassembling these false narratives in real
[01:41:21.220 --> 01:41:26.660]  time and this of course is why the legacy media is turning to the state to help control alternative
[01:41:26.660 --> 01:41:31.060]  voices in the same way that you know crazy religious people will turn to the government
[01:41:31.060 --> 01:41:36.500]  to suppress other religions because they simply can't handle it in the free market of ideas
[01:41:36.500 --> 01:41:41.140]  that's right and so we now have the fake news narrative that they've created and I believe
[01:41:41.140 --> 01:41:47.060]  this was something there was a tactic that they'd already decided upon they included Donald Trump
[01:41:47.060 --> 01:41:50.820]  as part of this because they didn't expect to lose the election but they were already working on
[01:41:50.820 --> 01:41:57.060]  this legislation three years ago they remove the prohibitions on propagandizing Americans with the
[01:41:57.060 --> 01:42:00.500]  voice of America and Radio Free Europe you know that was part of the prohibition say well we're
[01:42:00.500 --> 01:42:04.980]  going to create these propaganda arms but we're not going to allow them to actually broadcast
[01:42:04.980 --> 01:42:09.060]  into America well they repealed that three years ago we said we know where this is going we had
[01:42:09.060 --> 01:42:12.820]  Matt Drudge come here tell us that he had Supreme Court Justice Tom where it was going
[01:42:12.820 --> 01:42:17.780]  this though is exactly the tactic they were going to use but how absurd that they've got people like
[01:42:17.780 --> 01:42:23.540]  Brian Williams who is going to tell us about fake news and he's going to attack other people
[01:42:23.540 --> 01:42:29.540]  as being fake news this is why they're collapsing on every front you see all of these mainstream
[01:42:29.540 --> 01:42:33.780]  media organizations that are collapsing the only one that doesn't seem to be is the one
[01:42:33.780 --> 01:42:40.660]  Washington Post that is flush with cash from Jeff Bezos and but they have lost more credibility
[01:42:40.660 --> 01:42:46.420]  than anybody because of the ways that they have manipulated the news obviously to everyone who
[01:42:46.420 --> 01:42:50.340]  takes a look at it the way they've manipulated the news and this run up to the Trump election
[01:42:51.140 --> 01:42:56.260]  oh David here's how sad it is and here's how pathetic the left is and this sort of general
[01:42:56.260 --> 01:43:01.540]  collective as socialist mentality so they control the family in general because of course there are
[01:43:01.540 --> 01:43:05.700]  family courts run by the government that are pretty male hostile and you have no fault divorce and you
[01:43:05.700 --> 01:43:11.220]  have alimony child support you know they messed up the family quite a bit they control academia they
[01:43:11.220 --> 01:43:16.260]  control the media in terms of the entertainment media they control the mainstream media in general
[01:43:16.260 --> 01:43:21.140]  they control government schools they can i mean just everywhere you go you're in this hive mind
[01:43:21.140 --> 01:43:28.340]  of leftist collectivism and they still can't win against people with webcams and good arguments
[01:43:28.340 --> 01:43:33.380]  that just shows to me what a fragile and weak position it is and how they need to keep expanding
[01:43:33.380 --> 01:43:38.500]  control over other people's voices in order to pretend that there's any kind of legitimate debate
[01:43:38.500 --> 01:43:43.620]  yeah it's very interesting too we had this uh article from Daily Mail yesterday talking about
[01:43:43.620 --> 01:43:48.820]  how facebook is going to cut down on what they consider to be hate speech and and listen to
[01:43:48.820 --> 01:43:53.300]  the contradictions here this is something that came out of a german newspaper sz magazine
[01:43:53.300 --> 01:43:58.820]  uh claim that they gained access to facebook's secret rules for deleting hate speech and offensive
[01:43:58.820 --> 01:44:04.100]  content i know you're gonna love this stuff on according to them uh the phrase effing muslims
[01:44:04.100 --> 01:44:08.820]  is banned but if you say effing migrants that would be allowed if it falls into a quasi protected
[01:44:08.820 --> 01:44:15.140]  category posting migrants are dirty would be acceptable on the site while migrants are dirt
[01:44:15.140 --> 01:44:20.260]  is not writes the magazine then you could say irish women are dumb that would be breaking the rules
[01:44:20.260 --> 01:44:25.620]  according to the magazine that saw these rules while you if you say irish teenagers are dumb
[01:44:25.620 --> 01:44:31.220]  would not be because terms like teenagers retiree and youth do not get special protection this is
[01:44:31.220 --> 01:44:36.660]  the way there's playing with our language to achieve their goals this is this is going to
[01:44:36.660 --> 01:44:42.180]  destroy facebook if they do this type of thing and rightfully so well let me put forward a radical
[01:44:42.180 --> 01:44:46.980]  idea it may maybe entirely too alarming to your listeners but let me put forward a radical idea
[01:44:46.980 --> 01:44:51.460]  about how we might deal with these kinds of things rather than have computer algorithms rather than
[01:44:51.460 --> 01:44:56.100]  have a bunch of cheeto eating lefties on a couch determining which is fake news and what is real
[01:44:56.100 --> 01:45:01.460]  news i've got a radical idea let's all bring our best arguments to the marketplace of ideas
[01:45:01.460 --> 01:45:06.180]  and let people judge for themselves let's just throw the doors wide turn on the sunlight bring
[01:45:06.180 --> 01:45:11.060]  the worst ideas the most horrible ideas the most offensive ideas let's bring them into the general
[01:45:11.060 --> 01:45:16.100]  marketplace of ideas let's hash it out and let's everyone see just how terrible these ideas are
[01:45:16.100 --> 01:45:20.580]  because if these ideas are so terrible that they must be banned well surely we trust the people
[01:45:20.580 --> 01:45:24.260]  enough because we all know how well they've been educated by the government we trust the people
[01:45:24.260 --> 01:45:28.260]  enough to know what are bad ideas and what are good ideas let's just throw the doors wide let's
[01:45:28.260 --> 01:45:32.340]  bring everyone in let's bring the most offensive people in let's give them a big microphone let's
[01:45:32.340 --> 01:45:36.820]  let them make their case because people are smart enough to figure out what is a good idea and what
[01:45:36.820 --> 01:45:41.700]  is not now if people aren't smart enough to figure out what is a good idea and what is a bad idea i
[01:45:41.700 --> 01:45:46.420]  fail to see how we can have any kind of representative democracy because that's the whole point of
[01:45:46.420 --> 01:45:50.660]  democracy is trying to figure out a good idea from a bad one they just want to do the thinking for
[01:45:50.660 --> 01:45:55.700]  you i've said often that you have two types of people those who admit their bias and those who
[01:45:55.700 --> 01:46:01.300]  don't okay because everybody has bias you have bias even in the stories that you choose to report
[01:46:01.300 --> 01:46:05.700]  even if you try to do it as objectively as possible there's going to be a bias that works
[01:46:05.700 --> 01:46:10.740]  its way in because you're going to think that uh story a is important whereas story b is not
[01:46:10.740 --> 01:46:14.900]  that's a bias right there somebody else might decide at a different news organization that the
[01:46:14.900 --> 01:46:19.140]  other story is more important that doesn't go reported so everybody has their bias and so for
[01:46:19.140 --> 01:46:25.140]  years and years when we just had those three uh networks and the government and they were all
[01:46:25.140 --> 01:46:28.740]  telling us the same thing and there was no discussion about what's fake news and what isn't
[01:46:28.740 --> 01:46:34.260]  because everybody was reading from the same script i used to go to the heavy opinion journals so i
[01:46:34.260 --> 01:46:38.820]  would get national review and the nation and i would compare the two of them and let them uh you
[01:46:38.820 --> 01:46:43.300]  know give me the arguments on both sides and that's really what a thinking population needs to do
[01:46:43.300 --> 01:46:48.340]  and so in a sense if we can have this discussion about real news and fake news uh this could work
[01:46:48.340 --> 01:46:53.700]  out to our advantage as well because we're going to be able to uh talk to people and say well examine
[01:46:53.700 --> 01:46:57.860]  compare these two things side by side and that's what we try to do when we give people stuff that
[01:46:57.860 --> 01:47:01.860]  is completely different from what they're hearing from the mainstream media you do it as well we
[01:47:01.860 --> 01:47:06.740]  document this and we say well here's you know and here's this information that i got from
[01:47:06.740 --> 01:47:11.380]  the new york times so deal with it you know this is what this really means in the overall context
[01:47:12.100 --> 01:47:16.820]  well there is a cycle to these kinds of things david as i'm sure you're very well aware
[01:47:16.820 --> 01:47:22.020]  which is that those of us who have non-leftist opinions if you've went your way through higher
[01:47:22.020 --> 01:47:28.180]  education as i did i ended up getting a master's degree you have to really really work hard if
[01:47:28.180 --> 01:47:34.420]  your ideas are not mainstream in academia right so if you say the capitalists exploit the workers
[01:47:34.420 --> 01:47:38.020]  you don't need to provide any footnotes because you know you're you're appealing to a lot of
[01:47:38.020 --> 01:47:44.340]  the leftist biases in a lot of the professors on the other hand if you say a capitalist do not
[01:47:44.340 --> 01:47:48.420]  exploit their workers then you better make a really good argument with really good footnotes so you
[01:47:48.420 --> 01:47:54.020]  can get past the skepticism of the lefty uh professorship exactly and so basically you you're
[01:47:54.020 --> 01:47:57.940]  like somebody if you if you're two-rate runners and you're practicing for a race and one of you is
[01:47:57.940 --> 01:48:03.140]  running downhill in a gentle decline and the other one is marching up at a 45 degree incline well
[01:48:03.140 --> 01:48:07.060]  who's going to win the race the guy who's had to work a lot harder in his training and this is the
[01:48:07.060 --> 01:48:11.940]  general cycle that is occurring the left has gotten lazy they decided not to win the case not to
[01:48:11.940 --> 01:48:17.060]  win arguments simply stuff the ballots with the immigrants uh illegal and legal and basically
[01:48:17.060 --> 01:48:20.980]  what's happened is they've gotten lazy they've been in control for so long that the lean mean
[01:48:20.980 --> 01:48:26.740]  fighting machines of the non-leftists are able to take them down pretty easily and now since
[01:48:26.740 --> 01:48:30.900]  gamer gay that the right has found its voice and is willing to hit back i think they're seeing the
[01:48:30.900 --> 01:48:34.580]  differences in training that has occurred over the past few decades that's a good point as you
[01:48:34.580 --> 01:48:40.580]  pointed out that they're educating the kids and so all you had to do for the lazy left was uh speak
[01:48:40.580 --> 01:48:46.420]  to their confirmation bias uh if we wanted to do something else we had to get very uh adept at
[01:48:46.420 --> 01:48:52.260]  research and documentation and argumentation and debate in order to push something that was
[01:48:52.260 --> 01:48:56.820]  contrary to their bias they're that they've uh already been taught and the in the amount of
[01:48:56.820 --> 01:48:59.700]  time we got we got another segment is coming up we're not going to be able to finish this here
[01:48:59.700 --> 01:49:03.940]  probably but i want to talk to another aspect do we talk about the fiat currency let's talk about
[01:49:03.940 --> 01:49:08.340]  another aspect of the federal reserve and that is the way they manipulate the economy not just
[01:49:08.340 --> 01:49:13.860]  through the currency but through these rate increases now we've just had the first rate increase
[01:49:13.860 --> 01:49:18.580]  and i think it's only the second one in a decade i believe that they just announced and they announced
[01:49:18.580 --> 01:49:23.860]  that they're going to do another three next year and we've seen this whole thing before with a
[01:49:23.860 --> 01:49:28.100]  rope of dope done by allen greenspan where he did and i i can't remember the number it was something
[01:49:28.100 --> 01:49:35.620]  like uh 12 rate decreases in a row held it for a second and then did 17 rate increases in a row
[01:49:35.620 --> 01:49:39.780]  over a very short period of time looks just like a regular step it was like every quarter he was
[01:49:39.780 --> 01:49:46.820]  raising it uh the interest rates and that created a kind of rope a dope uh bubble to pull people in
[01:49:46.820 --> 01:49:52.020]  and then he burst that bubble uh is this what they're trying to do now with uh trump are they trying
[01:49:52.020 --> 01:49:57.700]  to manipulate and push back against any advantage that we might have with a reduction of taxes
[01:49:57.700 --> 01:50:03.860]  and regulations by increasing interest rates this of course is the great danger of getting a free
[01:50:03.860 --> 01:50:08.820]  market oriented kind of fellow into power and this would of course have been the case with ron paul
[01:50:08.820 --> 01:50:13.380]  or other people is that the embedded power structures and in particular the fiat currency
[01:50:13.380 --> 01:50:18.340]  power structure which is where so much of government power derives well they are a think of them as
[01:50:18.340 --> 01:50:23.940]  an organism that's cornered and they will lash out and so there's a reason why you could say post
[01:50:23.940 --> 01:50:28.820]  jfk uh presidents have not really decided to go after the federal reserve because the federal
[01:50:28.820 --> 01:50:34.180]  reserve has a hand grenade called interest rates called money printing and they can i think
[01:50:34.180 --> 01:50:39.060]  they choose to do things that would be extremely deleterious to the country and because not one
[01:50:39.060 --> 01:50:45.220]  person in a thousand in america or throughout the west understands the incredible power that
[01:50:45.220 --> 01:50:48.900]  central banks have over the economy they think we're in some sort of free market but if you

[01:56:26.340 --> 01:56:33.300]  views and his truth about video series that looks at an unbiased uh objective facts regarding
[01:56:33.300 --> 01:56:38.820]  current news stories and historical events you'll find that at free domain radio as well as he's on
[01:56:38.820 --> 01:56:45.540]  twitter at stefan malinow now stefan we're talking about the rate increases you pointed out nobody's
[01:56:45.540 --> 01:56:50.100]  really seriously challenged the central bank since jfk there's reason for that i think the first
[01:56:50.100 --> 01:56:54.980]  person to challenge the central bank was andrew jackson he had an assassination attempt on him
[01:56:54.980 --> 01:56:59.540]  as well but he survived that the central bank did not survive andrew jackson but they did
[01:56:59.540 --> 01:57:04.900]  weasel their way back in uh these rate increases are something that i think is going to be a key
[01:57:04.900 --> 01:57:12.500]  tactic as the left fights back in the next year there are i think two groups that are currently
[01:57:12.500 --> 01:57:17.860]  at war with the way things are going with with regards to donald trump the first of course is
[01:57:17.860 --> 01:57:23.460]  the leftists and they are ideological in other words they truly believe you know that rich people
[01:57:23.460 --> 01:57:27.860]  are rich because they've stolen from poor people and there's no bell curbing intelligence and everyone's
[01:57:27.860 --> 01:57:32.740]  the same and and and all inequalities arise from exploitation like they fully double down on that
[01:57:32.740 --> 01:57:37.220]  ideology and they're just going to fight using whatever tactics they have on the other hand though
[01:57:37.220 --> 01:57:43.300]  there are the pragmatists who use leftist leftist ideology to do the classic marxist divide and
[01:57:43.300 --> 01:57:48.660]  set people against each other and destroy the family and all this kind of stuff now the pragmatists
[01:57:48.660 --> 01:57:53.780]  i think are going to have some sympathy for what donald trump is doing because if there's any indication
[01:57:53.780 --> 01:57:57.220]  what's been happening with the dow and what's been happening happening with the retention of jobs
[01:57:57.220 --> 01:58:01.700]  in america as the result of donald trump's phone calls to particular people then what what's going
[01:58:01.700 --> 01:58:06.660]  to happen is the economy is going to improve under donald trump and the people who were in charge
[01:58:06.660 --> 01:58:10.100]  they don't want to milk cow until it dies you know they don't want to kill the goose that
[01:58:10.100 --> 01:58:14.980]  lays the golden egg so there are the useful idiots on the left who are just going to double down
[01:58:14.980 --> 01:58:18.900]  on their philosophy no matter what and don't have any long-term survivability but are just
[01:58:18.900 --> 01:58:24.500]  ideologically programmed but there are in some ways more sinister the people who are in charge
[01:58:24.500 --> 01:58:29.780]  who want to stay in charge and recognize that they do need a boost to the economy in order to
[01:58:29.780 --> 01:58:34.660]  continue being in charge and i think there is going to be a conflict between those two groups
[01:58:34.660 --> 01:58:38.820]  in terms of supporting donald trump in the short run versus trying to take him down from an ideal
[01:58:38.820 --> 01:58:42.420]  hang on we're going to be right back with stefan malny we got another five minutes of stefan he's

[02:00:27.460 --> 02:00:36.820]  to the central texas command center it's alex jones welcome back to the alex jones show i'm
[02:00:36.820 --> 02:00:42.580]  david night and we're talking to stefan malinu in this last segment and as we went to break
[02:00:42.580 --> 02:00:46.100]  stefan you were talking about how there's two different groups that are going to be there in
[02:00:46.100 --> 02:00:51.220]  washington we're gonna have leftist ideologs and pragmatists i want to get to those leftist
[02:00:51.220 --> 02:00:57.140]  ideologs here we we need to talk about the obama transition team because obama is not
[02:00:57.140 --> 02:01:00.820]  going to go away he's made it very clear he's going to operate a shadow government and we've
[02:01:00.820 --> 02:01:05.140]  seen things that are really unprecedented in this country usually there's what they call
[02:01:05.140 --> 02:01:10.340]  honeymoon period after the voters have voted most of the time the opposition will kind of lay off and
[02:01:10.340 --> 02:01:16.420]  kind of get the you know lick their wounds and kind of reassess the situation not so in this
[02:01:16.420 --> 02:01:21.540]  particular case right away riots in the streets and so forth now we see obama saying that he's
[02:01:21.540 --> 02:01:26.740]  going to remain in washington this is something we've not seen since woodrow wilson that we
[02:01:26.740 --> 02:01:32.100]  had a president remain in washington he's also had some of his key advisors like john holdren say
[02:01:32.100 --> 02:01:36.900]  i'm not going anywhere i'm going to be here to speak out against anything that uh trump does
[02:01:36.900 --> 02:01:42.420]  against our climate change agenda and we've had obama announced that he's going to get with
[02:01:42.420 --> 02:01:46.580]  eric holdren he's going to challenge redistricting plans throughout the country because we have so
[02:01:46.580 --> 02:01:51.700]  many republican legislatures that have uh redistricted to their favor just as the democrats
[02:01:51.700 --> 02:01:56.340]  always do so he's going to try to overturn in the courts what they couldn't win at the ballot
[02:01:56.340 --> 02:02:02.500]  box and then he's also talking about how he's going to coach young talent so we've got all of these
[02:02:02.500 --> 02:02:07.140]  different aspects here his youth core perhaps if you want to look at it or identifying the next
[02:02:07.140 --> 02:02:11.300]  group of leaders but they're coalescing into a shadow government this is something we haven't
[02:02:11.300 --> 02:02:17.620]  seen before let's talk a little bit about the ideologue left well i mean my argument has been
[02:02:17.620 --> 02:02:22.100]  david for a long time that old donald trump's victory has done is by his time it has not
[02:02:22.100 --> 02:02:27.780]  solved the problem it has simply bought us some time in the same way that mccarthy in the 1950s
[02:02:27.780 --> 02:02:33.220]  going after the intense soviet infiltration of the state department and other departments within
[02:02:33.220 --> 02:02:38.260]  the u.s. government bought some time it did not solve the problem as we can see but the endless
[02:02:38.260 --> 02:02:44.100]  revivals of marxism that comes back like whack-a-mole till your arm falls off so we do need to stay i
[02:02:44.100 --> 02:02:49.860]  think the job for the alternative media is to continue to bring good reasons good arguments
[02:02:49.860 --> 02:02:55.460]  and very passionate and powerful diatribes if that's what's necessary to the masses as a whole
[02:02:55.460 --> 02:03:00.740]  to help bring them to a more rational state of mind because sure the left has their particular
[02:03:00.740 --> 02:03:04.740]  agenda they have their particular goals and they're not going to give up then the left never
[02:03:04.740 --> 02:03:09.220]  sleeps they never give up they always double down and so we need to be resolute you know as the old
[02:03:09.220 --> 02:03:14.180]  saying goes the price of liberty is eternal vigilance trump has bought us some time if he's able to
[02:03:14.180 --> 02:03:20.260]  achieve what he wants and even if you're only able to achieve 25 percent of it which is pretty good
[02:03:20.260 --> 02:03:24.980]  for a lot of these promises he's bought us time and what we need to do is take that time to continue
[02:03:24.980 --> 02:03:29.300]  to educate take the continuing freedom of speech that we possess to continue to educate people
[02:03:29.300 --> 02:03:35.300]  so that we can build a more philosophical grounds well against leftism rather than just like oh well
[02:03:35.300 --> 02:03:39.220]  you know the economy's improved a little and that's all great but that's the effect of pursuing
[02:03:39.220 --> 02:03:44.020]  particular moral values like protection of property freedom of speech and so on let's continue
[02:03:44.020 --> 02:03:49.380]  to educate people on that so that we can disarm the left fundamentally rather than playing whack-a-mole
[02:03:49.380 --> 02:03:53.860]  with each policy proposal I agree and I think it's actually kind of a good sign just like I said with
[02:03:53.860 --> 02:03:57.860]  fake news if we can have this debate as to what's fake and what is real I think we're going to win
[02:03:57.860 --> 02:04:04.100]  that debate if Obama and the leftist ideologues are going to double down on this as they indicate
[02:04:04.100 --> 02:04:08.100]  they're going to do rather than looking and saying you know what the country has kind of understood
[02:04:08.100 --> 02:04:11.220]  some things about how globalism isn't working out and some of these other policies that they
[02:04:11.220 --> 02:04:16.500]  don't like so we're going to try to adapt to that and try to shift the party a little bit no
[02:04:16.500 --> 02:04:20.260]  they're not going to do that they're going to double down they've already done it in an unprecedented
[02:04:20.260 --> 02:04:25.060]  way I think that's going to be a very good case for us because I really do think this is a fight
[02:04:25.060 --> 02:04:31.620]  we can win step on oh absolutely you know I was thinking about way back in the day uh David if
[02:04:31.620 --> 02:04:35.860]  you wanted to pursue the truth outside of the mainstream agenda before the internet you were
[02:04:35.860 --> 02:04:41.860]  just a crazy guy in a library and you know now of course we've been able to join hands you know
[02:04:41.860 --> 02:04:45.620]  before we were kind of individual stars in the night sky now there are lines between us and
[02:04:45.620 --> 02:04:50.740]  we're turning to constellations that can actually tell stories and undo mythology so I think we
[02:04:50.740 --> 02:04:56.500]  absolutely have been handed an incredible opportunity to change the course I agree I agree and and we
[02:04:56.500 --> 02:05:00.420]  joined hands with step on all new you can find him at free domain radio dot com thank you so much
[02:05:00.420 --> 02:05:03.220]  for joining us we're learning more than ever about the Tunisian asylum seeker wanted in the
[02:05:03.220 --> 02:05:07.860]  Berlin massacre he was jailed for four years in Italy for burning down a school and arrested

[02:05:13.700 --> 02:05:18.820]  fly list and he settled in Italy after leaving his hometown in Tunisia now his father claimed this

[02:08:20.100 --> 02:08:27.620]  hi welcome back to the alex jones tell i'm david night
[02:08:28.420 --> 02:08:32.340]  that music i got a tiger by the tail but the leftist got a tiger by the tail they're coming
[02:08:32.340 --> 02:08:36.820]  after donald trump uh you know it's kind of interesting this article from daily mail where
[02:08:36.820 --> 02:08:42.820]  they say trump yeah okay he lost by 2.8 million votes but guess what if you take away california
[02:08:42.820 --> 02:08:49.460]  he actually won if you take away california and new york he won by 3 million they point out that
[02:08:49.460 --> 02:08:56.500]  california and new york had a combined 5.8 million vote advantage in just those two states
[02:08:56.500 --> 02:09:02.820]  as a matter of fact 4.2 million vote advantage so that was a margin of victory in california alone
[02:09:02.820 --> 02:09:08.900]  4.2 million votes just in california and they say well you know this we need to have a direct
[02:09:08.900 --> 02:09:14.420]  democracy and popular election because hillary won by 2.8 million votes she won california by
[02:09:14.420 --> 02:09:20.260]  4.2 million votes she won new york by 1.6 million votes if you get rid of the electoral college
[02:09:20.260 --> 02:09:24.500]  california new york are going to be choosing your president that's why we have the electoral
[02:09:24.500 --> 02:09:29.860]  college it's a firewall as i've said before a firewall against the concentration of power
[02:09:29.860 --> 02:09:35.220]  and against the corruption that you're going to find in these populous states that are going to be
[02:09:35.860 --> 02:09:41.620]  controlled by one or two populist cities that usually have a lot of corruption in those cities
[02:09:41.620 --> 02:09:46.660]  as well and that's why it's so important and even then we still had an electoral college
[02:09:46.660 --> 02:09:53.460]  hillary clinton um losing five electors donald trump just losing two i think that's very
[02:09:53.460 --> 02:09:59.220]  interesting and we have jim webb lampooning bill clinton he's keeps talking about how he won by a
[02:09:59.220 --> 02:10:06.420]  landslide well jim webb who also ran as a democrat a democrat who actually spoke truth in the democrat
[02:10:06.420 --> 02:10:13.140]  debate when he said people have a right to protect themselves and it is gross hypocrisy for all you
[02:10:13.140 --> 02:10:17.940]  the rest of you on this stage to say that you would take away individuals rights to protect
[02:10:17.940 --> 02:10:22.660]  themselves with firearms when you have an army of security guards protecting each and every one of
[02:10:22.660 --> 02:10:29.220]  you he said that to them and you could just imagine the jaws dropping and they uh that that uh
[02:10:29.220 --> 02:10:33.220]  auditorium where there was nothing but democrats there but he spoke the truth to bill clinton as
[02:10:33.220 --> 02:10:37.940]  well he said bill clinton reminds me he said this on twitter bill clinton reminds the media
[02:10:37.940 --> 02:10:43.460]  that he won by a landslide quote unquote and the electoral college let's remember that he won only
[02:10:43.460 --> 02:10:49.220]  43 percent of the popular vote so you see it works out a couple of different ways as newt
[02:10:49.220 --> 02:10:54.580]  gingrich pointed out about the electoral college he said uh this is a football season a team can
[02:10:54.580 --> 02:10:59.220]  have more yards and still lose the game what matters is the points that you put on the board
[02:10:59.220 --> 02:11:05.140]  and i think reason had a better explanation for it they said look the world series is a best of seven
[02:11:05.140 --> 02:11:11.700]  games you think about the election we have 51 different elections 50 states plus a district of
[02:11:11.700 --> 02:11:17.780]  columbia and so it's who wins the most of those just like it's the baseball team that wins the most
[02:11:17.780 --> 02:11:24.340]  number of games in the world series not the baseball team that scored the most runs okay so
[02:11:24.340 --> 02:11:28.420]  there's a lot of there's different rules and those are good rules to have the problem with it
[02:11:28.420 --> 02:11:33.380]  is the faithless electors and i believe that that's something a can of worms that's been unleashed
[02:11:33.380 --> 02:11:38.900]  that is going to only grow and get worse unless we address this at the state level where it needs
[02:11:38.900 --> 02:11:45.300]  to be addressed understand as we were talking about the obama transition team and how he is
[02:11:45.300 --> 02:11:50.580]  going to continue pushing in an unprecedented way we've never seen a president stick around
[02:11:50.580 --> 02:11:55.780]  and remain politicized like this like he's going to do like he's announced he's going to do even
[02:11:55.780 --> 02:12:02.100]  teaming with eric holder to sue legislatures and republican states we understand they're
[02:12:02.100 --> 02:12:05.060]  going to come after trump in a number of ways the other way they're going to go after him and you
[02:12:05.060 --> 02:12:09.940]  hear this a lot with is with all this conflict of interest stuff is he going to put it in a
[02:12:09.940 --> 02:12:14.660]  blind trust into a half blind trust is he going to give it to his children so forth and so on
[02:12:14.660 --> 02:12:22.100]  and you have to understand that there is no requirement that he do that and it was never
[02:12:22.100 --> 02:12:27.060]  considered to be unethical when past presidents continued to own their businesses or to pass
[02:12:27.060 --> 02:12:33.140]  them off to their children why is that well it's because we wanted to have people who were not
[02:12:33.140 --> 02:12:40.500]  professional politicians why is it somehow ethical when people like nancy polosi use insider training
[02:12:40.500 --> 02:12:46.500]  as a congressperson and remember that was a big stink everybody got outraged and they found out
[02:12:46.500 --> 02:12:52.980]  that there was no prohibition against congress doing insider trading knowing that they're going to
[02:12:52.980 --> 02:12:59.380]  regulate to death a particular industry and then maybe selling short stock in that industry that
[02:12:59.380 --> 02:13:05.460]  they're about to kill or that they're going to reward handsomely a particular company like say
[02:13:05.460 --> 02:13:10.900]  elon musk's company that's received over four billion dollars worth of subsidies so you know if
[02:13:10.900 --> 02:13:16.340]  you got stuck in one of his companies you know he's going to be getting a big government handout
[02:13:16.340 --> 02:13:21.220]  to make him profitable maybe you'll buy stocks in his so they can use that kind of insider
[02:13:21.220 --> 02:13:27.780]  trading like nobody else can because as the economy becomes increasingly run by the central
[02:13:27.780 --> 02:13:33.060]  government the central government and can profit a lot from insider trading the people who are
[02:13:33.060 --> 02:13:37.380]  creating those rules so when that came out people were very concerned about that they were angry
[02:13:37.380 --> 02:13:44.340]  rightfully so and so polosi and company did some legislation they put it on the books said no no
[02:13:44.340 --> 02:13:50.580]  we're going to stop insider trading and then nine months later they quietly removed it and
[02:13:50.580 --> 02:13:55.220]  they never really complied with it in the meantime because of the way the regulations were set up so
[02:13:55.860 --> 02:14:03.460]  it's a double standard obviously i don't think that we want to try to penalize somebody who comes to
[02:14:05.060 --> 02:14:10.980]  politics directly from private life from running successful businesses i don't want to have a
[02:14:10.980 --> 02:14:15.060]  situation anymore and i think many of you don't i think that's the reason a lot of you voted for
[02:14:15.060 --> 02:14:20.500]  donald trump is you're sick and tired professional politicians career politicians and lawyers and the
[02:14:20.500 --> 02:14:26.980]  people who even though they're i said they don't stay in washington usually they do stay in washington
[02:14:26.980 --> 02:14:31.700]  many of the most of the senators and congressmen they stay there as lobbyists so it's a revolving
[02:14:31.700 --> 02:14:36.260]  door that goes on there that's part of the corruption that's part of the swamp that needs to be drained
[02:14:36.260 --> 02:14:41.620]  and donald trump clarified again today no i really am going to drain the swamp i think he really is
[02:14:41.620 --> 02:14:45.460]  going to go against it will give him the benefit of the doubt but still the swamp is going to come
[02:14:45.460 --> 02:14:52.020]  back and try to penalize him and try to penalize anybody that is outside of politics that is not
[02:14:52.020 --> 02:14:55.780]  a lawyer they're going to try to penalize them for being involved in politics i think it was a good
[02:14:55.780 --> 02:15:02.820]  thing when we had a george washington who said two terms are enough he didn't he wasn't term limited
[02:15:02.820 --> 02:15:08.180]  he said two terms is enough i'm going back to my business i'm going back to my farm and just like
[02:15:08.180 --> 02:15:13.700]  cincinnatus and a lot of people made that come comparison to him the roman emperor who said that
[02:15:13.700 --> 02:15:19.060]  who went back to the plow after being a roman emperor so i think it's important to have people
[02:15:19.060 --> 02:15:22.980]  who have been successful who know how to achieve something and we don't need to strip them in
[02:15:22.980 --> 02:15:27.300]  penalty of all this but that is going to be a tactic of the left believe me they're going to come
[02:15:27.300 --> 02:15:31.860]  after him in multiple ways it's just one of the many ways that they're going to attack and as i
[02:15:31.860 --> 02:15:35.700]  point out at the very top of the program we have this article from the hill where the GOP is saying
[02:15:35.700 --> 02:15:40.500]  we're going to hold off on repealing certain obama care taxes this is something that was on the
[02:15:40.500 --> 02:15:45.220]  dredge report you have to understand the GOP never really wanted to get rid of obama care
[02:15:45.220 --> 02:15:50.580]  they won the election a couple of years ago because people wanted to get rid of obama care
[02:15:50.580 --> 02:15:53.460]  they said they were going to do it just like they said they were going to control the borders but
[02:15:53.460 --> 02:15:57.220]  they weren't serious about doing either one of those things i point out over and over again
[02:15:57.220 --> 02:16:03.380]  hey they didn't have a plan to get rid of obama care donald trump did have a plan but if you
[02:16:03.380 --> 02:16:10.980]  have no plan you're planning on not doing it that's very very clear trump's plan was to
[02:16:10.980 --> 02:16:17.620]  replace the mandates with markets to replace the coercion with choice and he had a lot of
[02:16:19.140 --> 02:16:24.740]  a lot of different points in his health care policy issues very detailed for a candidate
[02:16:24.740 --> 02:16:29.780]  to do something like that typically they keep it very broad very general lines no he had point by
[02:16:29.780 --> 02:16:34.420]  point i'm going to do this this and this he was going to create competition he was going to allow
[02:16:34.420 --> 02:16:39.540]  the insurance companies to compete across state lines see why wouldn't we want to do that we're
[02:16:39.540 --> 02:16:44.260]  told by the establishment that we want to have open trade with all the countries but not open
[02:16:44.260 --> 02:16:49.460]  trade with insurance policies within our own country right no trump said we're going to do that
[02:16:49.460 --> 02:16:54.820]  and he was mocked in the debate by marco rubio who said you're going to lines lines you're talking
[02:16:54.820 --> 02:17:00.500]  about lines what is this lines stuff i mean it's just juvenile juvenile stuff he knew what it was
[02:17:00.500 --> 02:17:04.820]  about he was hoping that you wouldn't figure it out but also giving us information about the
[02:17:04.820 --> 02:17:11.060]  costs of health care providers so giving us information allowing us to make the choices
[02:17:11.060 --> 02:17:17.300]  letting us have more of our money back in terms of tax credits in terms of health savings accounts
[02:17:17.300 --> 02:17:22.660]  so empowering us to make those decisions giving us a choice giving us the information to make
[02:17:22.660 --> 02:17:27.860]  that choice those are all things that could be done but the GOP says no no no let's not get rid
[02:17:27.860 --> 02:17:32.020]  of those obama care taxes listen to this from the hill congressional republicans are considering
[02:17:32.020 --> 02:17:36.580]  holding off on repealing some of obama care's taxes according to lobbyists familiar with the
[02:17:36.580 --> 02:17:40.340]  discussions they say they want to keep some of these taxes in place they said there's at least
[02:17:40.340 --> 02:17:47.540]  a possibility some taxes could remain to provide revenue for a replacement health care measure i
[02:17:47.540 --> 02:17:54.180]  don't want some kind of replacement government run health care measure that has to be subsidized
[02:17:54.180 --> 02:17:59.460]  by taxes we don't want the government taking over that part of the economy that's the whole point
[02:17:59.460 --> 02:18:04.980]  GOP that you don't want to acknowledge and of course they never had a plan as i point out but
[02:18:04.980 --> 02:18:11.940]  they put up romney who had already enacted obama care so it was going to be either obama who's
[02:18:11.940 --> 02:18:17.940]  going to do obama care or romney who is going to do romney care it was exactly the same plan and
[02:18:18.580 --> 02:18:24.260]  obama pointed that out so the establishment said whether it's a republican or a democrat
[02:18:24.260 --> 02:18:29.620]  in the 2012 elections we want to have government run health care and they are still saying that
[02:18:29.620 --> 02:18:34.740]  both the democrats and the republicans that's the fight that donald trump has on his hands
[02:18:34.740 --> 02:18:40.340]  and they go on to say obama care includes a range of taxes that along with cuts to medicare funded
[02:18:40.340 --> 02:18:46.100]  its expansion of coverage subsidizing it okay and so that's a very different thing than what
[02:18:46.100 --> 02:18:50.180]  we're talking about in terms of letting people save their own money you say yeah health insurance
[02:18:50.180 --> 02:18:55.140]  is important health care is important let us pay for that before we send that money to washington
[02:18:55.140 --> 02:19:01.060]  give us a tax cut so that we can take care of the most important things before we send that money to
[02:19:01.060 --> 02:19:07.140]  you where you squander and waste it they say these taxes are on both industry groups such as taxes on
[02:19:07.140 --> 02:19:13.380]  health insurers and taxes on medical device companies and on people how does that help us with
[02:19:13.380 --> 02:19:20.260]  health care when you tax medical devices it makes it more expensive for everybody when you tax the
[02:19:20.260 --> 02:19:25.060]  health insurers even though you're subsidizing them with one hand then you tax them with the other
[02:19:25.060 --> 02:19:31.300]  this is insanity this is what we see happening over and over again there was a report that i had
[02:19:31.300 --> 02:19:38.500]  from a road and track talking about the corporate average fuel economy and they said look at this
[02:19:38.500 --> 02:19:43.300]  20 years ago the the roads were filled mostly with cars now they're mostly trucks why is that
[02:19:43.300 --> 02:19:48.260]  because they decided that in the name of increasing fuel efficiency they would give
[02:19:49.060 --> 02:19:54.340]  lax rules to trucks but not to cars so now you can get a v8 engine in a car in a truck or an suv
[02:19:54.340 --> 02:20:02.820]  but you can't get it in a car stay with us we'll be right back reality check rampant hacking identity

[02:26:21.780 --> 02:26:28.100]  up in the next segment we've got a special report from alex jones about this delta airlines hoax
[02:26:28.100 --> 02:26:33.540]  by this guy who speaks arabic to get everybody freaked out it's a hoax and he's going to break
[02:26:33.540 --> 02:26:37.140]  this down for you all the different things that have happened but i want to look at another story
[02:26:37.140 --> 02:26:43.300]  before we go to that there was a story that came out of the bbc news talking about how an airline
[02:26:43.300 --> 02:26:50.900]  crew sacrificed a goat just before a flight this is a pakistan pakistan's national airlines
[02:26:51.540 --> 02:26:59.860]  they had had their entire airline grounded after the entire fleet grounded after a december 7th
[02:26:59.860 --> 02:27:06.740]  crash that killed 47 people so this was the first flight after that horrific accident
[02:27:06.740 --> 02:27:13.060]  and the entire fleet grounded for testing and so what the staff did and they had viral pictures
[02:27:13.060 --> 02:27:19.940]  showing this they had the ground staff slaughtering a black goat next to the atr 42 aircraft which is
[02:27:19.940 --> 02:27:24.740]  about to leave for a domestic flight now that would be something that would alarm me if i were to
[02:27:24.740 --> 02:27:30.260]  see that happening but maybe this is something the democrats should try to get their party going
[02:27:30.260 --> 02:27:34.980]  back on again because you know they they love islam they love sharia law so you know that they could
[02:27:34.980 --> 02:27:42.660]  just pretend that they're paying homage to islam but they love scapegoats too don't they all this
[02:27:42.660 --> 02:27:47.220]  stuff about the russian hack and everything so this would be a perfect way for them to kill a
[02:27:47.220 --> 02:27:53.380]  couple of birds with one stone with that scapegoat so they could try to do some kind of a sacrificial
[02:27:53.380 --> 02:27:58.100]  altering to get the democrat party off the ground no they're not as we pointed out in the last
[02:27:58.900 --> 02:28:03.940]  hour when we're talking to stuff on malinu the leftist ideologues of the democrat party are
[02:28:03.940 --> 02:28:08.180]  going to double down on what they've been doing nancy polosi said changed they're not going to
[02:28:08.180 --> 02:28:11.380]  have any change we're not going to have any change in leadership and we're going to keep
[02:28:11.380 --> 02:28:17.860]  doing the same things that we've done we got no plans to do anything differently absolutely amazing
[02:28:17.860 --> 02:28:22.980]  to see how they're going to continue to just double down and again alex is going to talk about the
[02:28:22.980 --> 02:28:29.620]  sacrificial uh not the sacrificial goat but the hoax that was played on everyone by this guy
[02:28:29.620 --> 02:28:35.780]  who likes to scare people in the plains by chanting in arabic and i guess he's just counting
[02:28:35.780 --> 02:28:39.940]  when we went to the break i was talking about this corporate average fuel economy and this
[02:28:39.940 --> 02:28:44.260]  was an open letter from rodentrack saying hey you know this is something donald trump could really do
[02:28:44.820 --> 02:28:50.820]  by getting rid of this corporate average fuel economy because by 2025 this regulation is
[02:28:50.820 --> 02:28:57.540]  going to require an average fuel economy of 60 miles per gallon for cars and 30 miles per gallon
[02:28:57.540 --> 02:29:03.220]  for large trucks now that's doable for the trucks but you're going to have some radical changes on
[02:29:03.220 --> 02:29:09.860]  the cars if this happens and he points out that this is another good example of how government
[02:29:09.860 --> 02:29:16.500]  regulation that was intended to make vehicles more fuel efficient actually did just the opposite
[02:29:17.140 --> 02:29:24.740]  so they're trying to enact a 74 percent increase in fuel economy for cars but uh rather for trucks
[02:29:24.740 --> 02:29:30.340]  but a 315 percent increase for cars so what does that mean that means that they started
[02:29:30.340 --> 02:29:34.820]  putting big engines in trucks because they got preferential treatment they started pushing
[02:29:34.820 --> 02:29:40.740]  trucks and now you've got more fuel inefficient trucks than you do cars so as they regulate
[02:29:41.300 --> 02:29:46.100]  one thing to death then people move to something else that's the way it always works out with
[02:29:46.100 --> 02:29:51.140]  regulations and that's why we have less fuel economy than we did before stay with us we'll
[02:29:51.140 --> 02:29:56.180]  be right back with alex jones alex jones and the gcn radio network
[02:30:00.020 --> 02:30:04.820]  an alarming report coming out of campus reform that talks about how muslim students are demanding
[02:30:04.820 --> 02:30:10.180]  prayer rooms in every major building now students at the university of maryland they've released a
[02:30:10.180 --> 02:30:16.180]  list of 64 of their demands all in an effort to make their campus quote more amenable this project
[02:30:16.180 --> 02:30:22.900]  it's known as protect umd it's an effort between 25 different student organizations at the university
[02:30:22.900 --> 02:30:28.580]  of maryland this news is coming just after the ohio state attack where we saw one muslim student
[02:30:28.580 --> 02:30:33.380]  who felt marginalized he actually took out his frustration and plowed into a crowd of students
[02:30:33.380 --> 02:30:38.500]  and then began stabbing them milley weaver took to the streets on ohio state's campus shortly after
[02:30:38.500 --> 02:30:43.380]  and so did rebel media and they asked students why they thought that this one muslim student in
[02:30:43.380 --> 02:30:49.220]  particular decided to quote act out and surprisingly students said that he probably felt marginalized
[02:30:49.220 --> 02:30:53.460]  so it looks like the university of maryland is tackling that and they're going to allow students
[02:30:53.460 --> 02:30:58.260]  to have prayer rooms now in every major building but only if you're muslim i'm margaret hell reporting

[02:37:17.140 --> 02:37:24.340]  media runs this fake news story knowing he's a famous hoaxer that's done this over and over
[02:37:24.340 --> 02:37:29.700]  and over again on airplanes but black ispanic white they're on these planes like what the hell

[02:37:50.980 --> 02:37:55.780]  civilizations oh and break this down well and let's not forget there was a lady i believe it was an
[02:37:55.780 --> 02:38:02.100]  lax uh gop tennessee retweeted this today with the hashtag boycott delta who was a lady who she
[02:38:02.100 --> 02:38:06.260]  was wearing a hijab with the full dress saying we're going to blow your planes up muslim is here
[02:38:06.260 --> 02:38:10.580]  to blow your planes up so okay is that a hoax is that real i don't know why can't we be freaked out
[02:38:10.580 --> 02:38:14.740]  is this actually going on we're supposed to sell about all of our freedoms down the drain in the
[02:38:14.740 --> 02:38:18.660]  name of safety that these islamic terrorists want to take us down but then we have to be tolerant
[02:38:18.660 --> 02:38:23.700]  but let's just take another case study before we look more specifically at this boycott delta
[02:38:23.700 --> 02:38:28.260]  black church torched in mississippi vote trump painted on the wall now this is from november
[02:38:28.260 --> 02:38:33.300]  third now let's recall what were they talking about with this white supremacists trump supporters
[02:38:33.300 --> 02:38:37.860]  are white supremacists they're racist okay right because they burned down the black church and wrote
[02:38:37.860 --> 02:38:44.500]  vote trump on the wall story comes out today man arrested for burning down that church it was a black
[02:38:44.500 --> 02:38:48.980]  man who was a member of the congregation let's go further that's happened hundreds of times
[02:38:48.980 --> 02:38:53.300]  this week though the muslim women came out said trump didn't attack him trump supporters didn't
[02:38:53.300 --> 02:38:58.900]  attack him the jewish groups was swastikas every time fake every time so we've got that story
[02:38:58.900 --> 02:39:06.500]  you've also got this story uh this is um member there was a uh gay youtube star callum mixwigan
[02:39:06.500 --> 02:39:12.580]  who's claims that he was beat up on the worst night of his life for being openly gay took pictures
[02:39:12.580 --> 02:39:17.860]  tweeted him from the hospital that turned out to be a total hoax now alex this is the shocking thing
[02:39:17.860 --> 02:39:22.180]  to me you mentioned the muslim stories before where they claim they were beaten up by trump
[02:39:22.180 --> 02:39:26.820]  supporters made up we've had the youtube the gay youtube star claimed he was beat up by people
[02:39:26.820 --> 02:39:31.860]  that hated gays that was made up white supremacists burned down the black church that was made up
[02:39:31.860 --> 02:39:38.420]  the media runs with all this so today you get the boycott delta because adam salee does a video
[02:39:38.420 --> 02:39:42.660]  claiming he gets kicked off of a delta flight and that's what's crazy let me continue this is absolutely
[02:39:42.660 --> 02:39:48.260]  on target now they're going from doing hoaxes and getting caught to doing the hoax admitting it's
[02:39:48.260 --> 02:39:52.900]  a hoax but still they're the victim so so the way to get around getting caught that it's a hoax
[02:39:52.900 --> 02:39:57.460]  admit it's a hoax but then you don't get in trouble when you're the one doing the hoax
[02:39:57.460 --> 02:40:02.260]  because well you're an effing white male it's your fault so this is a known hoaxer this is a
[02:40:02.260 --> 02:40:10.420]  2.2 million subscribers on youtube hoaxer makes money on youtube pranking people even on planes
[02:40:10.420 --> 02:40:16.020]  doing arabic stunts sharing the living hell out of families so so okay so then so then what is this
[02:40:16.020 --> 02:40:22.100]  guy doing is he pranking somebody right now is this some elaborate prank and the media is so
[02:40:22.100 --> 02:40:27.140]  stupid and people are so stupid on twitter that they're going along with it they're so desperate
[02:40:27.140 --> 02:40:30.340]  they're going along with it and i'm gonna say something if you were a muslim a moderate muslim
[02:40:30.340 --> 02:40:33.700]  and there are a lot of them they're like that getting bullied by you know by the shahadis
[02:40:33.700 --> 02:40:37.780]  if you saw a guy getting up acting like this doing doing a countdown and like getting ready like
[02:40:37.780 --> 02:40:41.620]  they do obviously to get a rise he knows what he's doing trying to scare the hell out of people
[02:40:41.620 --> 02:40:46.100]  wouldn't you kick his ass i'm not calling for that i'm saying i personally would make a move to
[02:40:46.100 --> 02:40:50.820]  defend my family if i thought this was happening i mean it's not i'm a hero it's instinctive if you
[02:40:50.820 --> 02:40:56.260]  were hispanic wouldn't you do it if you were white or black of course you would so that's what i'm
[02:40:56.260 --> 02:41:01.540]  saying he knows what he's doing the media is going along with this it shows how they got caught
[02:41:01.540 --> 02:41:07.460]  lying on the election they're not backing down now they're going to intensify it so it's just
[02:41:07.460 --> 02:41:11.940]  a crazy time to be alive continue well and we actually have our new security here and i was
[02:41:11.940 --> 02:41:16.260]  talking with him this morning about this he said man that guy's lucky i wasn't on the plane i probably
[02:41:16.260 --> 02:41:19.860]  would have snapped his neck in half if i was sitting behind him he's lucky there wasn't an air
[02:41:19.860 --> 02:41:24.660]  marshal with a gun right behind him that didn't blow his brains out but think about this alex
[02:41:24.660 --> 02:41:29.940]  so if this guy really wants to complain that he's being um victimized by discrimination
[02:41:29.940 --> 02:41:35.700]  because he's arabic well hey why are you going on airplanes and counting down to 10 why is that a
[02:41:35.700 --> 02:41:41.540]  joke why is it a joke for you to put on a turbine and get on a plane and speaking arabic or pretending
[02:41:41.540 --> 02:41:45.620]  that you're going to blow the plane why is that a joke listen if you went to any muslim country and
[02:41:45.620 --> 02:41:50.660]  tried to have a woman pull her headdress off her you know the biki pursuit they would attack you
[02:41:50.660 --> 02:41:55.940]  if you if you taught the bible in 13 countries they would kill you again but then there's this

[02:45:03.460 --> 02:45:07.940]  and the timing is perfect you know we just had the christmas the car crash yesterday you have
[02:45:07.940 --> 02:45:11.700]  oh it's all funny yeah oh and that's what they say a part of the jihad is there's the cultural
[02:45:11.700 --> 02:45:16.420]  jihad wearing the burqas out revenant in our face getting in our face making a submit to them
[02:45:16.420 --> 02:45:20.820]  the left ones christmas band too what a grip of trash there is also an incident that happened
[02:45:20.820 --> 02:45:25.140]  in germany in a mall where uh refugees i think they were from somalia started climbing up the
[02:45:25.140 --> 02:45:28.980]  christmas tree pulling the decorations down they did this in a public mall they think they have
[02:45:28.980 --> 02:45:34.740]  the right to do this because they look at us as scum they really do and they think exactly
[02:45:34.740 --> 02:45:39.140]  haven't joined as long exactly we're subhuman well you know what i'm not sorry about all the
[02:45:39.140 --> 02:45:44.100]  spacecraft and science and everything else i happen to like christmas because i get to see
[02:45:44.100 --> 02:45:49.220]  my family and friends that i love and make memories with them and you know get away from the mess of
[02:45:49.220 --> 02:45:55.540]  everything for a couple days and that's my tradition that's my holiday i don't interfere with your
[02:45:55.540 --> 02:46:00.580]  holidays whatever they are whether they're islamic whether they're jewish i don't care that's your
[02:46:00.580 --> 02:46:04.820]  freedom just stay out of my business why do you hate my religion why do you hate my traditions
[02:46:04.820 --> 02:46:10.100]  i don't hate yours the tradition i hate is you blowing people up you making jokes about it on
[02:46:10.100 --> 02:46:13.700]  a plane that's what i don't like it is long have a holiday where they don't kill people let's just
[02:46:13.700 --> 02:46:19.780]  have a holiday heaven have a 365 thousand dollar day i don't say something i am dead on on this
[02:46:19.780 --> 02:46:25.300]  subject because i didn't want the globalist to invade the non-radical muslim countries like syria
[02:46:25.300 --> 02:46:31.380]  iraq uh and and libya to a great extent destabilized it and put the jihadis in that our government
[02:46:31.380 --> 02:46:37.620]  bipartisan wing with the neocons and the democrats back to destabilize the whole region and then stir
[02:46:37.620 --> 02:46:42.740]  them up and have this new caliphate army to bring into europe in our own country to basically dominate
[02:46:42.740 --> 02:46:47.860]  us who are incompatible with a free society that's the plan so i'm not against the muslims i'm not
[02:46:47.860 --> 02:46:54.260]  against the non-radical muslims but islam sees them as the heretics okay i am sick of it and i'm
[02:46:54.260 --> 02:46:58.740]  tired of the worst people of your religion running around like a bunch of psychopaths with a bunch
[02:46:58.740 --> 02:47:05.620]  of weirdo pedophile saudi royalty finance in the garbage and and exporting their crazies to piss on
[02:47:05.620 --> 02:47:11.060]  us politically and we're done we're done and america's rising and i don't want to turn the
[02:47:11.060 --> 02:47:17.460]  middle east into a parking lot but understand when push comes to shove we're going to remove the
[02:47:17.460 --> 02:47:20.980]  globalist who thought they'd make a deal with islam and take out america in the west it ain't
[02:47:20.980 --> 02:47:26.820]  happening so the west doesn't start the fights we finish it get it straight and understand it
[02:47:28.900 --> 02:47:33.540]  that was an amazing report as i said there and watch for the first time that video footage of
[02:47:33.540 --> 02:47:40.260]  these muslims in a mall climbing up what was a two or three story christmas tree to destroy it
[02:47:40.260 --> 02:47:46.260]  to take it down i tell you nothing says that they hate us and hate our culture more than that type
[02:47:46.260 --> 02:47:53.220]  of thing imagine going to somebody's country uninvited and demanding that you be supported
[02:47:53.780 --> 02:47:59.780]  demanding that you be educated and then having the audacity to destroy what you find there that
[02:47:59.780 --> 02:48:06.340]  you don't like it's just like gert wilders said he said this is an invasion to replace our people
[02:48:06.340 --> 02:48:11.140]  to erase our culture and nothing says that more than that particular image there you know the
[02:48:11.140 --> 02:48:16.420]  people who are going to be the fact checkers are people that we really need to take a look at and
[02:48:16.420 --> 02:48:22.260]  of course this is broken the last day or so the fact that there's been a divorce between the two
[02:48:22.260 --> 02:48:29.220]  people on the couch with their cat barbara and david michelson who run snopes and they as well
[02:48:29.220 --> 02:48:34.420]  as the pointer institute that i talked about last week this facility in st petersburg
[02:48:34.420 --> 02:48:42.020]  that has six faculty members they say that they are a global organization promoting truth and
[02:48:42.020 --> 02:48:46.740]  journalism whatever they got six faculty members they do online seminars they don't even give a
[02:48:46.740 --> 02:48:54.180]  degree as far as i can tell they and snopes and politifact which is another joke that's from the
[02:48:54.180 --> 02:48:58.500]  other side of the bay the other side of tampa bay i used to i grew up in tampa there used to be the
[02:48:58.500 --> 02:49:02.740]  tampa times that's the tampa bay times that is running politifact and they're a joke as well
[02:49:02.740 --> 02:49:08.180]  well i want to tell you some of the stuff that's come out in this divorce filings that's there
[02:49:08.180 --> 02:49:13.860]  as the daily mail points out snopes is founded by this husband and wife team who used a letterhead
[02:49:14.420 --> 02:49:19.380]  claiming that they were a non-existent society before they started their research they claimed
[02:49:19.380 --> 02:49:24.980]  that they were the san fernardo valley folklore society they put that name on the letterheads
[02:49:24.980 --> 02:49:29.140]  although there was never any society by that name that's the way these guys got started
[02:49:29.140 --> 02:49:34.580]  the fact checkers the people are going to be the arbiters of truth with even a phony header on there
[02:49:34.580 --> 02:49:39.540]  now his wife is claiming that her ex-husband is guilty of embezzlement suggesting he's attempting
[02:49:39.540 --> 02:49:44.660]  a boondoggle to change tax arrangements while she says uh while david claims that she took
[02:49:44.660 --> 02:49:49.780]  millions from their joint account and bought property in los vegas now this guy has a new
[02:49:49.780 --> 02:49:55.060]  wife elissa young employed by the website as an administrator she has worked as an escort and a
[02:49:55.060 --> 02:50:00.500]  porn actress despite claims that the website is non-political she ran as a libertarian for congress
[02:50:00.500 --> 02:50:09.300]  on a dump bush platform what bush was that um w hw i don't know anyway uh the also the main
[02:50:09.300 --> 02:50:14.900]  fact checker is a dominatrix uh name that has a website called vice vixen when i look at all

[02:56:20.660 --> 02:56:26.180]  we've got them doing things in the united states to churches as well let's what do you have that's
[02:56:26.180 --> 02:56:32.180]  right so what we're seeing on social media and vocative has covered this and so few media outlets
[02:56:32.180 --> 02:56:36.580]  are actually talking about it we had to talk about this thank you for having me isis has released
[02:56:36.580 --> 02:56:42.340]  this list of thousands of churches in all 50 states their names and addresses calling for these
[02:56:42.340 --> 02:56:48.020]  lone wolf attacks to enter the churches and create what they're calling a bloody celebration in the
[02:56:48.020 --> 02:56:54.020]  christian new year we're seeing an all-out war on christians in this country and for isis the audacity
[02:56:54.020 --> 02:56:59.860]  of them to actually list them out by name and address and then call their supporters meanwhile
[02:56:59.860 --> 02:57:04.500]  the president the last 29 days the last leg of this i believe the official number released was
[02:57:04.500 --> 02:57:10.100]  14 000 remaining refugees he's trying to push through the country to fulfill that 110 000 it'll
[02:57:10.100 --> 02:57:14.820]  actually be over the number that he originally promised to take for the fiscal year can you imagine
[02:57:14.820 --> 02:57:20.100]  margaret if there was a christian pastor who didn't like islam and he put out a list of islamic
[02:57:20.100 --> 02:57:26.980]  mosques and call people to go create commit acts of violence do you know could you count to uh two
[02:57:26.980 --> 02:57:32.180]  before he would be arrested by the federal government and rightfully so okay but these
[02:57:32.180 --> 02:57:37.940]  people get away with it oh it's so it's amazing the audaciousness of this and what's worse for me
[02:57:37.940 --> 02:57:43.300]  david so we've got these social media groups like facebook uh one of these groups uh they had an open
[02:57:43.300 --> 02:57:49.940]  social media page called secrets of jihadis in english by the way uh not censored not shut down
[02:57:49.940 --> 02:57:56.100]  able to move about freely we saw this with uh ferruc uh i believe is her name her first name
[02:57:56.100 --> 02:58:00.900]  escapes me but the ferrucs uh the san bernadino massacre that happened because of a christmas
[02:58:00.900 --> 02:58:05.220]  party they didn't want to attend so well you know we're just going to go and kill nine people because
[02:58:05.220 --> 02:58:11.540]  of it she had expressed specific sentiments on on social media as well nothing happened to her and
[02:58:11.540 --> 02:58:16.420]  there needs to be a pushback on these platforms because they're censoring us they're censoring
[02:58:16.420 --> 02:58:21.300]  talk about that more when we come back from the break but who published this isis list uh this is
[02:58:21.300 --> 02:58:27.460]  on twitter or facebook the one social media group uh it's called secrets of jihadis and uh this
[02:58:27.460 --> 02:58:32.820]  article there you go it doesn't call out facebook we know that of course there there are people who
[02:58:32.820 --> 02:58:37.620]  are suing facebook google and twitter because of the orlando massacre stay with us and be right back

[03:00:19.700 --> 03:00:26.820]  welcome back to the alex jones show i'm david night with margaret howell and we were just
[03:00:26.820 --> 03:00:33.220]  talking about this list that isis has put out of american churches calling for people to go there
[03:00:33.220 --> 03:00:40.660]  and create a bloody massacre and you know margaret i i interviewed a guy from south africa who went to
[03:00:40.660 --> 03:00:45.860]  a liberal church who was just visiting there but he was a concealed carry person he said he had to
[03:00:45.860 --> 03:00:50.900]  go through a process to determine if he's going to carry weapons or not he had a pistol with just
[03:00:50.900 --> 03:00:58.580]  six shots and that church was chosen they later learned by some african communists to attack
[03:00:58.580 --> 03:01:01.620]  because they knew it would be a bunch of white liberals they came in throwing hand grenades
[03:01:01.620 --> 03:01:06.820]  spraying the place with fully automatic weapons but this guy from the opposite corner way up high
[03:01:07.460 --> 03:01:11.700]  takes a couple of shots and actually hit one of these guys then he went out the round side
[03:01:11.700 --> 03:01:16.420]  because he said i don't think i hit anybody he goes outside comes around the other side his name
[03:01:16.420 --> 03:01:23.620]  was charl von i can't remember is it south african anyway he hits hits another guy from the other
[03:01:23.620 --> 03:01:28.100]  so they thought they were being shot at from multiple angles and i gotta say pastors you need
[03:01:28.100 --> 03:01:32.820]  to your shepherds right look after your sheep get somebody that's going to be in your church
[03:01:32.820 --> 03:01:36.740]  that's going to be able to protect them if you got a higher security or you get somebody in your
[03:01:36.740 --> 03:01:42.420]  congregation that carries a concealed and i gotta say the sheep stop being sheep that's the best
[03:01:42.420 --> 03:01:47.380]  advice anybody could give them frankly is to be awakened to be alert and understand that we are
[03:01:47.380 --> 03:01:51.860]  in a war we're currently in a war and nothing reflects that better than what's happening in
[03:01:51.860 --> 03:01:58.900]  western europe right now the church is under siege and it wants to creep into um you know it's our
[03:01:58.900 --> 03:02:03.540]  multiculturalism are welcoming it's taking full advantage of that i know briefly we're running
[03:02:03.540 --> 03:02:08.260]  out of time you covered a story last week and i touched on it briefly this morning about the
[03:02:08.260 --> 03:02:15.060]  university of maryland the 64 demand list which included having a prayer room in all major buildings
[03:02:15.060 --> 03:02:21.140]  so that muslims feel welcome on the campus and there seems to be this radical push and christians
[03:02:21.140 --> 03:02:27.060]  were were taught to be accepting and loving and welcoming and forgiving and soros if you recall
[03:02:27.060 --> 03:02:32.980]  he called the catholics useful idiots in this push so it's time to not be a useful idiot any
[03:02:32.980 --> 03:02:39.220]  longer and to not let go of what is rightfully yours when it comes to having the freedom to worship
[03:02:39.220 --> 03:02:44.260]  in this country they scream bloody murder when the christians want to have a bible study in an
[03:02:44.260 --> 03:02:49.860]  unused room and yet they demand that they establish rooms that's true establishment of religion and
[03:02:49.860 --> 03:02:55.780]  you set aside rooms for this particular religion and also margaret they want to have shuttle service
[03:02:55.780 --> 03:03:00.580]  to a mosque that's a half hour away from campus i mean these people believe that they're entitled
[03:03:00.580 --> 03:03:06.020]  but the interesting thing i think is how they're allied with radical feminists and the lgbt people
[03:03:06.020 --> 03:03:09.540]  who they want to kill they want to take these feminists and put them in burqas and they want
[03:03:09.540 --> 03:03:14.820]  to throw the lgbt people off the roof okay hello you know we should send these women that are you
[03:03:14.820 --> 03:03:19.300]  know i've seen these professors they're wearing the burqa in solidarity it's a solidarity movement
[03:03:19.300 --> 03:03:24.580]  for you go to a muslim i have reported from muslim countries there is such a restriction when it
[03:03:24.580 --> 03:03:30.580]  comes to women showing their hair it's it's a it's an all out hatred and it's a hatred for humanity
[03:03:30.580 --> 03:03:37.140]  it's massed in uh in religion of course but it's it's not just about women as we know it's a hatred
[03:03:37.140 --> 03:03:41.620]  for all humanity and anything that stands up against Islam frankly yeah there was just this
[03:03:41.620 --> 03:03:47.380]  german minister who went to saudi arabia and the prince was furious about it but not as furious
[03:03:47.380 --> 03:03:52.420]  as the mainstream media in europe who really came after her for disrespecting their culture
[03:03:52.420 --> 03:03:57.780]  and at the same time you had french television going through a muslim neighborhood and they
[03:03:57.780 --> 03:04:02.500]  were harassing these women said get out of here this is for men only you're not covered and so
[03:04:02.500 --> 03:04:07.620]  forth and so on right and said this is not allowed it's like our home here and this is a place that
[03:04:07.620 --> 03:04:12.580]  was 10 miles from the center of paris in a neighborhood they said it's not it's like our home
[03:04:12.580 --> 03:04:17.380]  they don't consider france to be their home they consider themselves to be occupiers and to take
[03:04:17.380 --> 03:04:22.980]  it over right i mean it's there there seems to be a almost a there is a feeling of they have a right
[03:04:22.980 --> 03:04:26.980]  to do this and uh stand your ground doesn't begin to come close to this i know we're running out of
[03:04:26.980 --> 03:04:30.980]  time just briefly mentioning paris i want to touch on this because it was really an important story
[03:04:30.980 --> 03:04:36.500]  that we sort of missed yesterday uh the eu so they've had almost a year to decide what to do after
[03:04:36.500 --> 03:04:40.660]  the shooting in batta clan and what are they going to do they're going to they're going to impose
[03:04:40.660 --> 03:04:44.980]  more restrictive rights on anybody carrying a gun because they don't want you to be able to defend
[03:04:44.980 --> 03:04:50.900]  yourself in the event that you find you were yourself in the clutches of a terrorist absolutely
[03:04:50.900 --> 03:04:54.420]  insane like i said before they can't tell the difference when it's semi semi-trailer and a
[03:04:54.420 --> 03:05:00.500]  semi-automatic stay with us john rapapour we'll be hosting the fourth hour we'll be right back
[03:05:00.500 --> 03:05:05.060]  more than ever about the tunisian asylum seeker wanted in the berlin massacre he was jailed for
[03:05:05.060 --> 03:05:09.780]  four years in italy for burning down a school and arrested three separate times in germany before
[03:05:09.780 --> 03:05:16.100]  police quote lost him anise army was also on the us no fly list and he settled in italy after
[03:05:16.100 --> 03:05:20.500]  leaving his hometown in tunisia now his father claimed this in a radio interview there's currently
[03:05:20.500 --> 03:05:25.780]  a reward on his head a hundred thousand euro he spent four years in an italian jail for burning
[03:05:25.780 --> 03:05:30.740]  down a school before he left for germany last year the 23 year old was arrested three times but
[03:05:30.740 --> 03:05:35.620]  authorities allowed him to slip through the cracks even though he had been identified as an isa

[03:08:17.060 --> 03:08:30.580]  so does he it's alex jones on a gcm radio network this is john rapaport sitting in for alexa in a
[03:08:30.580 --> 03:08:40.340]  fourth hour here welcome lots to cover as some of you know and those of you watching no more
[03:08:40.340 --> 03:08:50.820]  fakenews.com is my site and i mentioned that because 15 years ago after oh 19 years as a reporter
[03:08:52.100 --> 03:09:00.180]  it was clear to me that fake news was everywhere and i wasn't talking about independent media
[03:09:01.380 --> 03:09:06.900]  or so-called alternative media i was talking about mainstream media right from the beginning
[03:09:06.900 --> 03:09:17.860]  that's where all the fake news was so hence no more fake news and it still is and i want to go
[03:09:17.860 --> 03:09:24.660]  over a little history with which i'm sure you're familiar but just kind of break down the steps
[03:09:24.660 --> 03:09:32.420]  of what happened after the election in major media how they tried to position themselves and
[03:09:32.420 --> 03:09:46.180]  uh con everybody into some new breaking story about fake news yes fake news so the first shot
[03:09:46.180 --> 03:09:55.540]  out of the box after hillary clinton lost came really from the washington post and their tune
[03:09:55.540 --> 03:10:06.340]  was fake news sites spread lies about hillary clinton and helped to lose the election for her
[03:10:07.300 --> 03:10:14.580]  fake news sites and for a lot of people this was a revelation what are they talking about fake
[03:10:14.580 --> 03:10:23.060]  news sites and so they cited some obscure uh and completely false source and they had to
[03:10:23.060 --> 03:10:29.140]  sort of half retract the story later but it didn't matter because it was out there and so in the echo
[03:10:29.140 --> 03:10:37.780]  chamber of major media it spread like wildfire oh there are these fake news sites and they what
[03:10:37.780 --> 03:10:44.740]  do they do anyway well some of them many of them just make up the news and pretend it's real in
[03:10:44.740 --> 03:10:54.900]  order to get clicks and views that was one thing and then another thing was well some of these sites
[03:10:55.860 --> 03:11:03.700]  are not just doing that they are vicious and hostile and they are pretending that they're
[03:11:03.700 --> 03:11:13.300]  reporting the truth and they're telling lies about american institutions about the government
[03:11:13.300 --> 03:11:24.180]  about especially hillary clinton and this could have cost her the election so that was really the
[03:11:24.180 --> 03:11:33.380]  first shot out of the box and recognizes i'm talking here that they are talking about i mean
[03:11:33.380 --> 03:11:41.380]  they major media in terms of generalities so when they say something it's often not really clear
[03:11:41.380 --> 03:11:48.980]  what they mean and that's on purpose that's on purpose so it's not me who's puzzled here by any
[03:11:48.980 --> 03:11:58.100]  of this i'm reporting their insanity with generalities which is how they handle it right that's what
[03:11:58.100 --> 03:12:05.220]  they do so i wrote a piece and i said well wait a minute folks the washington post started this
[03:12:05.220 --> 03:12:13.060]  this so let's look at just a little bit about the washington post and i wasn't even going back to
[03:12:13.940 --> 03:12:18.580]  older cia connections and so forth because the post was reporting
[03:12:20.340 --> 03:12:27.700]  that the cia was giving them important sourced information here about fake news
[03:12:27.700 --> 03:12:36.660]  i said look at recent history jeff bezos who owns amazon bought the washington post for
[03:12:36.660 --> 03:12:44.260]  250 million dollars just laid it on the table what's the connection there well it turns out
[03:12:44.260 --> 03:12:53.380]  that amazon has a 600 million dollar contract with the cia to provide cloud computing services
[03:12:53.380 --> 03:13:02.980]  oh oops wait a minute is that called a conflict of interest could that be a source of fake news
[03:13:04.420 --> 03:13:09.700]  does the washington post declare that they have a conflict of interest of course not
[03:13:10.260 --> 03:13:15.460]  because every time they mentioned the cia they would have to print some kind of a disclaimer
[03:13:15.460 --> 03:13:23.620]  we here at the washington post insist that our story is accurate but we have to say
[03:13:23.620 --> 03:13:33.620]  we have to say that our owner boss chief king monarch jeff actually has a contract with the cia
[03:13:33.620 --> 03:13:41.220]  for 600 million dollars and expects to make a lot more after that so take what we're saying
[03:13:41.220 --> 03:13:48.900]  in this story about the cia with a grain of salt the size of langley they're not going to do that
[03:13:49.620 --> 03:13:56.820]  they're never going to do that but they should they should so that was the first shot out of the
[03:13:56.820 --> 03:14:04.580]  box and it was vague and it was confusing and it was uh to say it was badly sourced would be a
[03:14:04.580 --> 03:14:11.620]  a huge understatement because they were talking about some website that seemed to have some
[03:14:11.620 --> 03:14:19.860]  inside baseball on fake news sites but didn't have anything at all second shot out of the box
[03:14:22.740 --> 03:14:28.820]  somehow these fake news sites the washington post and other media outlets said and they're
[03:14:28.820 --> 03:14:36.660]  now all getting on the bandwagon these fake news sites you see are connected to russia
[03:14:38.580 --> 03:14:48.420]  why what are we talking about here 100 000 uh fake news sites and bloggers that are somehow
[03:14:48.420 --> 03:14:56.980]  covertly working with the russian government i mean the story was so preposterous on its face
[03:14:56.980 --> 03:15:05.700]  and yet hillary supporters all kinds of people who were desperately hoping that somehow the
[03:15:05.700 --> 03:15:15.060]  election could be overturned or that somehow the globalist agenda could be saved uh from whatever
[03:15:15.060 --> 03:15:21.140]  trump was going to do to it we're climbing all over this bandwagon and screaming and shouting
[03:15:21.140 --> 03:15:32.980]  and so forth yes yes yes yes russia fake news it's all connected somehow how i mean i would certainly
[03:15:32.980 --> 03:15:41.380]  be i suppose included in fake news sites i'm talking on the phone or i have some covert
[03:15:41.380 --> 03:15:46.820]  means of communication with the russians somebody in the russian government is feeding me
[03:15:46.820 --> 03:15:50.260]  the data and i am putting it out there
[03:15:53.060 --> 03:16:03.780]  hmm what are they even talking about what are they even saying and this of course was
[03:16:03.780 --> 03:16:13.940]  completely unclear but that helps because as my first logic teacher told us in class so many moons
[03:16:13.940 --> 03:16:23.780]  ago the biggest weapon of non-logic and people who want to avoid rationality is the generality
[03:16:23.780 --> 03:16:33.300]  the vague generality russia fake news sites fake news bloggers oh yeah it all stirs up in a pot
[03:16:33.300 --> 03:16:45.540]  you see a gigantic pot and now they began coming after fake news sites like in fours possibly number
[03:16:45.540 --> 03:16:58.820]  one on their list and they've kept coming so then came on top of this you could call it maybe the
[03:16:58.820 --> 03:17:10.580]  third wave the language changed and now it was russia hacked the election russia hacked the
[03:17:10.580 --> 03:17:24.420]  election what does that mean that they went into voting machines precincts uh software computer
[03:17:24.420 --> 03:17:32.020]  companies those of you watching this right now are seeing from bbc news a headline can us election
[03:17:32.020 --> 03:17:39.140]  hack be traced to russia i mean bbc you know people say lots of responsible news outlets
[03:17:39.140 --> 03:17:47.460]  no they're not they're they're complete idiots and they're liars because what does that mean
[03:17:47.460 --> 03:17:54.820]  russian hack well of course the implication is in fact that they did go into the machines that
[03:17:54.820 --> 03:18:00.420]  they did go into the software that they subverted the vote that they changed the numbers the actual
[03:18:00.420 --> 03:18:07.620]  numbers in the election that's what the phrase hack the election says there's another one from
[03:18:07.620 --> 03:18:18.580]  nbc news putin obama on the phone the election hack so we break it down and what major media really
[03:18:18.580 --> 03:18:27.220]  seem to be saying is something much different what is that i'll tell you in a minute but
[03:18:28.180 --> 03:18:34.980]  let's take a little pause here because i want to tell you about christmas super sales specials

[03:24:24.660 --> 03:24:34.020]  okay the hack the election hack to break it down major media were basically saying okay look
[03:24:34.020 --> 03:24:48.500]  russia hacked the pedestal the hillary the dnc emails and fed them to wiki leaks and then wiki
[03:24:48.500 --> 03:24:56.340]  leaks released them and then all of these fake news sites jumped on board and began splashing
[03:24:56.340 --> 03:25:04.340]  this all over the internet now if you talk to the editor they're washing in posts and you
[03:25:04.340 --> 03:25:09.300]  try to nail them down and say this is what you're talking about now this is it this is exactly what
[03:25:09.300 --> 03:25:14.420]  you mean and you don't mean anything else no we mean a lot of things don't try to pin me down
[03:25:14.420 --> 03:25:21.380]  there's a whole lot of stuff going on here oh yeah yeah but this is sort of what they were saying
[03:25:21.380 --> 03:25:29.060]  and then of course julien assange of wiki leaks said no russia was not our source absolutely not
[03:25:31.060 --> 03:25:39.300]  and that left it up in the air well cia is now come oh yes cia is telling the post and other
[03:25:39.300 --> 03:25:46.980]  new stuff yes we have definitive evidence yes russia was hacking the election whatever that means
[03:25:46.980 --> 03:25:55.060]  and uh we are giving congress a briefing here and several congressmen said well okay but
[03:25:55.620 --> 03:26:04.820]  where's the evidence we hear what you're saying yeah here's some cnn cia director reassures staff
[03:26:05.700 --> 03:26:12.820]  reassures you know so in other words uh our evidence that russia did hack the election is
[03:26:12.820 --> 03:26:23.620]  is we assure you that they did oh baby i have a wonderful time with this mainly i guess because
[03:26:23.620 --> 03:26:30.020]  i've been working as a reporter and i know these people are fake i've known it for 30 years that
[03:26:30.020 --> 03:26:37.940]  they're fake and now they're basically saying hey look at us we're fake we're fake you know
[03:26:37.940 --> 03:26:46.100]  no they're walking around with their pants down saying look at us we're fake the world is falling
[03:26:46.100 --> 03:26:53.940]  and russia did it and we're fake i mean how could it be more transparent i don't know i mean it's
[03:26:53.940 --> 03:27:04.180]  just hysterical you know i mean if they weren't attacking independent news media then it would
[03:27:04.180 --> 03:27:12.020]  be nothing more than a gigantic joke and we would be doing nothing except laughing all right so
[03:27:14.900 --> 03:27:20.420]  wikileaks says no of course not we didn't get this information from russia we don't say where we
[03:27:20.420 --> 03:27:27.380]  got our information from for a very good reason because these sources could be killed you know
[03:27:27.380 --> 03:27:34.740]  if they were revealed and maybe they were look at the events surrounding the death of seth rich
[03:27:35.460 --> 03:27:44.980]  worked for the dnc maybe he was the leaker wikileaks offered 20 000 reward for information
[03:27:44.980 --> 03:27:54.500]  about his killing was not a robbery his wallet money and so forth were there at the scene
[03:27:54.500 --> 03:28:04.020]  so everybody picked up on this in major media okay the cia assures us
[03:28:04.740 --> 03:28:10.100]  uh other agencies in the intelligence community assures that russia hacked the election whatever
[03:28:10.100 --> 03:28:19.620]  that means you know whatever that means they assure us that it's true and there's a collaboration
[03:28:19.620 --> 03:28:30.500]  of some kind they don't spell it out between fake news sites and russia to subvert the election
[03:28:30.500 --> 03:28:36.660]  by revealing malicious information about hillary clinton let's call this that okay
[03:28:39.060 --> 03:28:46.340]  that's trying to put together the storyline for them because they're so fumbling and bumbling
[03:28:46.340 --> 03:28:52.420]  that they can't do it for themselves right okay so now we've got the following
[03:28:55.380 --> 03:29:01.300]  so if i were talking let's say to the editor of the washington post i would say okay so
[03:29:01.860 --> 03:29:09.140]  you admit then that the information in the wikileaks emails was destructive to hillary clinton
[03:29:09.140 --> 03:29:18.500]  right and he might say well yes he's already sensing where i'm going uh so it was destructive
[03:29:18.500 --> 03:29:48.340]  there because it was true take a break we'll be back
[03:29:49.380 --> 03:29:56.100]  we're on the march the empire's on the run alex jones and the gcn radio network
[03:30:00.020 --> 03:30:04.820]  an alarming report coming out of campus reform that talks about how muslim students are demanding
[03:30:04.820 --> 03:30:10.020]  prayer rooms in every major building now students at the university of maryland they've released
[03:30:10.020 --> 03:30:15.700]  a list of 64 of their demands all in an effort to make their campus quote more amenable this
[03:30:15.700 --> 03:30:22.260]  project it's known as protect umd it's an effort between 25 different student organizations at
[03:30:22.260 --> 03:30:27.780]  the university of maryland this news is coming just after the ohio state attack but we saw one
[03:30:27.780 --> 03:30:32.820]  muslim student who felt marginalized he actually took out his frustration and plowed into a crowd
[03:30:32.820 --> 03:30:37.700]  of students and then began stabbing them millie weaver took to the streets on ohio state's campus
[03:30:37.700 --> 03:30:42.980]  shortly after and so did rebel media and they asked students why they thought that this one muslim
[03:30:42.980 --> 03:30:48.340]  student in particular decided to quote act out and surprisingly students said that he probably
[03:30:48.340 --> 03:30:52.660]  felt marginalized so it looks like the university of maryland is tackling that and they're going
[03:30:52.660 --> 03:30:57.140]  to allow students to have prayer rooms now in every major building but only if you're muslim

[03:33:25.860 --> 03:33:29.140]  john rafferport back sitting in for alex in the fourth hour here
[03:33:31.220 --> 03:33:41.060]  so then we get serious real serious because then major media say okay look rush to hack the election
[03:33:41.060 --> 03:33:47.540]  whatever that means we're not even going to bother describing it the cia assures us it's so
[03:33:49.060 --> 03:33:55.620]  what does that mean we don't have any evidence but we don't care and there are thousands who knows
[03:33:55.620 --> 03:34:02.100]  how many quote fake news sites and bloggers that are taking their information from russia basically
[03:34:02.100 --> 03:34:10.740]  and spreading it all around in smearing hillary clinton by telling the truth about her because
[03:34:11.540 --> 03:34:18.900]  you know that's what's in the wiki leaks emails the truth about her the people around her the dnc
[03:34:18.900 --> 03:34:22.820]  the corruption some things about the clinton foundation all kinds of stuff
[03:34:25.540 --> 03:34:31.860]  that's what they're saying except now they have to say well that information is actually false
[03:34:31.860 --> 03:34:37.940]  that's in the emails oh really well if it's false information in the emails then it's
[03:34:39.700 --> 03:34:46.820]  then it's what so in other words everybody's lying about hillary clinton that's what you're
[03:34:46.820 --> 03:34:53.060]  saying you're saying that the wiki leaks email material was actually forged well we're not going
[03:34:53.060 --> 03:34:58.660]  that far their whole story falls apart they fall apart they're naked in front of the whole world
[03:34:58.660 --> 03:35:03.300]  but they don't care because they have the power they believe to attack and defeat
[03:35:05.140 --> 03:35:11.940]  major independent sites like this one that's what they think and so they go on the attack
[03:35:13.780 --> 03:35:21.620]  all the time they needed something as a pretext to go on the attack that's what we're talking about
[03:35:21.620 --> 03:35:32.420]  here why because they're losing because nobody believes major media anymore that's why and because
[03:35:32.420 --> 03:35:37.540]  trump during his campaign whether you like him you hate him you're indifferent i don't care
[03:35:38.420 --> 03:35:44.660]  but what he was talking about over and over and over again was the defeat of globalism
[03:35:44.660 --> 03:35:53.300]  and that is the force that is behind major media they are in lockstep together they are
[03:35:53.300 --> 03:35:59.300]  one they are brothers under the skin that's where the money is that's where the prestige
[03:35:59.300 --> 03:36:08.340]  and the power is that's the whole deal and so they have to say major media all of a sudden well
[03:36:08.340 --> 03:36:12.500]  what is there is no such thing as globalism and then you go back in their own stories and of
[03:36:12.500 --> 03:36:17.940]  course they're talking about globalism and you can go to david rockfeller and read his comments
[03:36:17.940 --> 03:36:24.580]  about globalism he's globalist you know the rockfellers behind the council on foreign relations
[03:36:24.580 --> 03:36:33.780]  the trilateral commission very important the united nations all of these groups whose purpose is a new
[03:36:33.780 --> 03:36:39.060]  world economic order which means it has to be a new political order which means it's all about
[03:36:39.060 --> 03:36:45.780]  technocratic control of every citizen on the face of the earth so let's you know get that straight
[03:36:45.780 --> 03:36:51.780]  okay that's what they're talking about they're talking about energy consumption as pat wood
[03:36:51.780 --> 03:36:57.540]  describes in his great book technocracy rising glad to see he was interviewed recently on info
[03:36:57.540 --> 03:37:04.980]  wars they are ultimately talking about an id card or a chip or whatever you want to call it
[03:37:04.980 --> 03:37:10.980]  that would register your energy consumption that would be doled out on a global basis to every human
[03:37:10.980 --> 03:37:16.420]  being on earth and when you reach the limit for the month or whatever the period of time is that's
[03:37:16.420 --> 03:37:25.060]  it you're done you can't consume any more energy because they know how much energy there is you
[03:37:25.060 --> 03:37:31.780]  see and they can divide that and by the number of people and decide who gets how much energy
[03:37:31.780 --> 03:37:37.700]  as a quota you've got a quota what do you think smart meters are about what do you think the smart
[03:37:37.700 --> 03:37:43.220]  grid is about what do you think sustainable development is all about what do you think agenda
[03:37:43.220 --> 03:37:51.140]  21 is all about what do you think all these globalists are trying to do they are trying to
[03:37:51.140 --> 03:38:01.220]  integrate every nation on earth into one system that is controlled by an elite technocracy that's
[03:38:01.220 --> 03:38:08.500]  what they're doing that's what they've been doing under our noses for a very long time and one crazy
[03:38:08.500 --> 03:38:14.820]  guy stood up and said guess what i'm running for president and i don't care i don't care i have no
[03:38:14.820 --> 03:38:18.980]  respect for the media i don't care what they say i don't care what they think i don't care what they
[03:38:18.980 --> 03:38:26.340]  do all i know is i think we ought to build back this country and we ought to forget about all
[03:38:26.340 --> 03:38:35.140]  of this globalism nonsense and he kept saying it over and over and over again and the mere saying
[03:38:35.140 --> 03:38:44.100]  of it was enough to alarm the globalists and say this is not good we do not want this message
[03:38:45.380 --> 03:38:52.020]  out there and we don't want anybody to actually try to implement it that would be a disaster if
[03:38:52.020 --> 03:38:59.700]  that actually happened for real so we've got to cut it off and they tried and they failed
[03:39:00.420 --> 03:39:08.740]  they didn't cut it off and i don't care what anybody says this what happened in the election
[03:39:09.860 --> 03:39:17.780]  is such a danger to these globalists and technocrats that they have to respond in the way
[03:39:17.780 --> 03:39:26.020]  that i've just laid out for you here in the last 35 40 minutes and i will continue to lay it out but

[03:40:27.940 --> 03:40:36.100]  and parts i've talked enough over the years to mainstream reporters to read between the lines
[03:40:36.100 --> 03:40:43.060]  of what they're telling me and what they're telling me basically is they understand
[03:40:43.060 --> 03:40:52.820]  and what their agenda has to be in order to stay in the system in order to rise up in the system
[03:40:52.820 --> 03:40:58.820]  in order to collect their paychecks in order to send their kids to college they know i can assure you
[03:41:00.020 --> 03:41:08.900]  they know and they are vetted carefully when they're hired after they're hired
[03:41:08.900 --> 03:41:14.500]  they've got talent spotters out there okay this guy's smart he can write and he's on the right
[03:41:14.500 --> 03:41:19.780]  side politically of what we want him to say let's bring him on board and see how he works out
[03:41:21.460 --> 03:41:32.420]  it's a classic infiltration operation come on it's been going on for 60 70 years at least
[03:41:32.420 --> 03:41:42.420]  in the press in the colleges where they hire people whose ideology is all important to them
[03:41:45.700 --> 03:41:54.820]  that's the game so they have to destroy trump they have to destroy what he was saying
[03:41:54.820 --> 03:42:03.540]  they have to destroy what he promised to do and the way that they do it is clear
[03:42:06.100 --> 03:42:10.500]  it's all this fake news out there there's so much fake news yeah fake news don't trust fake
[03:42:12.100 --> 03:42:19.220]  and now the major media have to go to the people who are really in charge of
[03:42:19.220 --> 03:42:25.940]  still the majority of news on the internet that's social media that's twitter that's facebook
[03:42:25.940 --> 03:42:33.060]  that's youtube and they've got to say to them hey boys help us out here help us defeat fake news
[03:42:34.740 --> 03:42:42.100]  because you're putting our news up right on facebook and so forth and we have a deal you
[03:42:42.100 --> 03:42:46.500]  know we're on the same team come on right zuckerberg you're on the same team and he says of course
[03:42:46.500 --> 03:42:53.780]  i'm on the same team because after all when you really look at where the funding started for
[03:42:54.660 --> 03:42:58.020]  facebook what do you see you see cia connected money
[03:43:00.980 --> 03:43:07.220]  curies on the same team there was never any doubt about that so they're going to censor
[03:43:07.220 --> 03:43:09.780]  they're going to bury what they consider to be fake news
[03:43:09.780 --> 03:43:18.260]  news in a preposterous way they're going to try their best and they're going to fail
[03:43:18.260 --> 03:43:24.740]  time and time again they're going to fail and the more they try the more they rub against
[03:43:24.740 --> 03:43:30.100]  people like you and others who are on the fence the more you're going to go away from mainstream
[03:43:30.100 --> 03:43:40.260]  news into independent news because you can see what they're doing you can see what they're doing
[03:43:40.260 --> 03:43:46.580]  they're running scared they're terrified they've got to get a guy like brian wiames who's like
[03:43:46.580 --> 03:43:53.540]  mr fake news to start talking about how we have to defeat fake news this is classic or welly and
[03:43:53.540 --> 03:44:00.820]  stuff i mean it's right out of 1984 find the biggest fakers in the world and have them
[03:44:00.820 --> 03:44:11.300]  accuse everybody else of fakery you know this is a holiday talk about the christmas holiday
[03:44:11.300 --> 03:44:18.740]  this is a holiday this season for me as a reporter because dreams are coming true
[03:44:18.740 --> 03:44:30.340]  dreams are coming true up until now i would say major media position has been kind of solid sober
[03:44:31.220 --> 03:44:37.860]  you know that's their attitude as they lie to you every single day in every single way that they can
[03:44:38.740 --> 03:44:46.020]  by telling overt lies by leaving out vital data by bringing in fake experts and calling them real
[03:44:46.020 --> 03:44:51.940]  and creating a consensus that doesn't even exist and calling it a consent i mean all of this
[03:44:51.940 --> 03:44:57.620]  but they do it like we are the authorities we know here it is this is the news this is real
[03:44:59.540 --> 03:45:08.020]  that's the way until now now it's like some drunken hysterical frat boy running around
[03:45:08.020 --> 03:45:15.860]  naked out on the quadrangle of the university at two o'clock in the morning screaming everybody's
[03:45:15.860 --> 03:45:27.940]  fake it's psychotic behavior that's what they're into now they've gone psycho and this is what
[03:45:27.940 --> 03:45:38.740]  happens to people who are chronic liars chronic sociopaths chronic greed heads when they're cornered
[03:45:38.740 --> 03:45:45.940]  they go psychotic that's what they do they start screaming they start making up stuff
[03:45:46.500 --> 03:45:51.860]  hey mr cia we need your help we need to call out fake news can you give us oh sure we can give
[03:45:51.860 --> 03:45:56.580]  you whatever you want well we got it doing fake news sites and so forth only we got to tie all
[03:45:56.580 --> 03:46:00.980]  this into russia hacking the election and russia actually fed the fake oh yeah i see where you're
[03:46:00.980 --> 03:46:05.140]  going with this no problem we'll fish out something we'll make a statement we'll do
[03:46:05.140 --> 03:46:10.340]  briefings bring in anybody we'll just feed in full of generalities and if they ask us for evidence
[03:46:10.340 --> 03:46:15.540]  we'll say we can't give it to you because we have to protect our sources and methods
[03:46:15.540 --> 03:46:21.940]  and national security blah blah blah sure we can do that because we've got a deal right
[03:46:21.940 --> 03:46:36.020]  600 million dollar contract here we're buddies right no problem boys in the back room are going
[03:46:36.020 --> 03:46:45.860]  psycho and it's gorgeous to see except for the fact that they really do want to bury independent
[03:46:45.860 --> 03:47:00.340]  media and the result of that war is to a significant degree in your hands your hands because it's
[03:47:00.340 --> 03:47:10.020]  where you go what you hear what you see what you read that determines how this war is going to
[03:47:10.020 --> 03:47:19.540]  end up the trend is certainly in the direction of independent media leaving major media in the dust
[03:47:20.580 --> 03:47:31.620]  but the future to a significant degree lies in your hands and i know because i know what's
[03:47:31.620 --> 03:47:40.900]  going on out there that many of you have been essentially bringing other people on board
[03:47:41.620 --> 03:47:46.980]  in various ways and saying hey look at this story look at that can you believe this and
[03:47:46.980 --> 03:47:51.460]  they say god this is incredible where did this come from and it turns out to be an independent
[03:47:51.460 --> 03:47:58.260]  news site that's where it's coming from well i got to read more of that i got to see more of that
[03:47:58.260 --> 03:48:07.860]  that and a whole new world opens up to that person that you helped create
[03:48:09.860 --> 03:48:13.860]  and you keep doing it over and over again and then he keeps doing it over and over again
[03:48:14.420 --> 03:48:22.660]  and you can't stop that you absolutely can't stop that they'll always be a way around whatever
[03:48:22.660 --> 03:48:32.180]  they do to keep this going and they know it they understand that and they can't change course
[03:48:33.860 --> 03:48:41.300]  that's the beauty of it see they're on this course it's heading to the edge of the cliff
[03:48:41.300 --> 03:48:46.820]  they're going to fall off it's going to be terrifying and they're going to crash on the rocks
[03:48:46.820 --> 03:48:56.660]  and explode and they can't get off that course because they're pledged in blood to the death
[03:48:56.660 --> 03:49:08.580]  to be brothers under the skin to the globalists there's no way out you sell your soul now if you
[03:49:08.580 --> 03:49:18.820]  you go back on your pledge or your promise you're dead one way or another in one form or another
[03:49:18.820 --> 03:49:25.940]  you're dead so they can't go back we have to understand that that's good to know that's a vital
[03:49:25.940 --> 03:49:32.420]  piece of information they're going down this same psychotic track they're going to be telling wilder
[03:49:32.420 --> 03:49:41.860]  and wilder tales that make no sense full of vague generalities and accusations that they hurl out
[03:49:41.860 --> 03:49:49.380]  there and it's going to rebound against them time and time and time again as i've said on this program
[03:49:49.380 --> 03:49:54.820]  before as a guest of alex there's a way they could turn their boats around if they really wanted to
[03:49:54.820 --> 03:50:01.780]  they begin covering the stories that independent media have been carrying for the last 10 15 years
[03:50:01.780 --> 03:50:06.500]  and their circulations would go through the roof because this is what the american people want to
[03:50:06.500 --> 03:50:13.460]  know this is what the american people have been waiting for in vain other stories that independent
[03:50:13.460 --> 03:50:20.100]  media are reporting and they're not getting it from mainstream because they can't because mainstream
[03:50:20.100 --> 03:50:26.820]  is pledged not to reveal those stories because those stories lie on the other side of the line where
[03:50:26.820 --> 03:50:35.140]  those people may not go they cannot go there no reporters no editors no anchors nobody

[03:54:23.780 --> 03:54:33.460]  wars dot com just a few minutes left so i just want to feed you one more tidbit here in this long
[03:54:33.460 --> 03:54:38.820]  and winding story that i've been telling for the last hour about major media the real fake media
[03:54:38.820 --> 03:54:46.260]  they are the real fake media would you boys come up and receive your trophies and your awards
[03:54:47.300 --> 03:54:55.620]  because we finally identified you as the authentic fake media yeah we should have an awards ceremony
[03:54:55.620 --> 03:55:01.940]  maybe guys could figure out how to do that maybe you can make a video you know green screen it
[03:55:01.940 --> 03:55:11.060]  possibly with a giant auditorium and a stage and now the washington post you know as you narrow it
[03:55:11.060 --> 03:55:19.140]  down who's going to win best picture usually is not the last one of the oscars best real fake
[03:55:19.140 --> 03:55:28.260]  media outlet goes to bow you know so here's the last tidbit oh the washington post is already
[03:55:28.260 --> 03:55:36.500]  running a story i'm reading how the war against fake news backfired oh yeah well okay and that is
[03:55:38.100 --> 03:55:45.860]  they do know investigative reporting and by that i mean you have a story you know it's juicy you
[03:55:45.860 --> 03:55:51.140]  know it's horrendous what you're going to discover you can already see that it's going to require a
[03:55:51.140 --> 03:55:56.820]  great deal of digging and so you're going to do the digging you're going to assign a reporter or two
[03:55:56.820 --> 03:56:04.660]  or three whatever to an ongoing story and you're going to pound away day after day month after
[03:56:04.660 --> 03:56:11.140]  month however long it takes and it's going to take a while and you're going to keep publishing stories
[03:56:11.140 --> 03:56:20.500]  or featuring on broadcasts as more and more is uncovered and it's going to build to a mighty
[03:56:20.500 --> 03:56:28.900]  roar as you expose more and people come out of the woodwork under pressure to confess to you
[03:56:28.900 --> 03:56:33.860]  the investigative reporter what they really did and how they roll over as you talk to them and
[03:56:33.860 --> 03:56:39.220]  they tell you you better talk to so-and-so he's even higher on the food chain you know this kind
[03:56:39.220 --> 03:56:46.820]  of it's not done it used to be done to some degree more than it is now that's for sure
[03:56:46.820 --> 03:56:54.020]  and i could cite you a few examples the great series on vaccine dangers published in a newspaper
[03:56:54.020 --> 03:57:02.820]  up in rochester new york about oh let's call it 30 years ago now a series that was just absolute
[03:57:02.820 --> 03:57:10.340]  dynamite you would never do that never find it now so therefore because that kind of investigative
[03:57:10.340 --> 03:57:15.620]  reporting is not even being done these major media outlets can blow the whistle on things and it's
[03:57:15.620 --> 03:57:22.340]  doesn't even matter they can say well the world ended today at 4 p.m. according to nasa and then
[03:57:22.340 --> 03:57:26.980]  tomorrow they just ignore it and they go on with another story and so forth and people don't even
[03:57:26.980 --> 03:57:32.420]  remember that they read the other story about the world ending i mean they could expose anything
[03:57:32.420 --> 03:57:39.140]  they want to and i know this because i quote some of these articles when i write my articles and
[03:57:39.140 --> 03:57:46.900]  show how even major media admitted for example that the mainstream medical system was killing
[03:57:46.900 --> 03:57:58.500]  225,000 people a year that's 2.25 million people a decade in the u.s. and they can do that a new study
[03:57:58.500 --> 03:58:04.180]  published in the journal american medical association july 26 2000 by dr barba starfield
[03:58:04.180 --> 03:58:10.340]  johns hopkins school of public health all this is in the record it's all true but then you see
[03:58:11.780 --> 03:58:17.300]  they've got a backup which is the ultimate backup which is we're not going to cover it anymore
[03:58:17.300 --> 03:58:33.220]  it's gone and so am i thank you alex thanks for the crew at info wars see you next week thank you
