[00:00.000 --> 00:23.720]  Finally, nothing moves, high noon, black not rolling below the asphalt drive, a concrete
[00:23.720 --> 00:40.000]  fastening, scraping the edge of nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing, this, this, was, was, was.
[00:40.000 --> 00:47.200]  Ladies and gentlemen, it's September 3rd, 2019.
[00:47.200 --> 00:50.720]  I'm your host, Alex Jones, we're gonna be live here for the next four hours, then you've
[00:50.720 --> 00:54.760]  got the war room.
[00:54.760 --> 01:02.040]  Black sunshine, I like that term, we're shining light on the black projects, the secret projects
[01:02.040 --> 01:06.360]  of the establishment that would rather have the general population behave like a bunch
[01:06.360 --> 01:17.200]  of over-entertained brain-damaged zombies on their way to historical, cultural, biological
[01:17.200 --> 01:18.200]  oblivion.
[01:18.200 --> 01:23.160]  But I don't want that, and I know how the universe works.
[01:23.160 --> 01:28.760]  Those of us that are aware of how the universe works will be doomed to something akin to
[01:28.760 --> 01:34.640]  hell if we do not try to help people achieve real consciousness.
[01:34.640 --> 01:38.400]  That's just the law of the universe, and all these fools that see the childlike nature
[01:38.400 --> 01:43.480]  of the general public and use it against them are not gonna cross the river Jordan, I can
[01:43.480 --> 01:44.480]  assure you.
[01:44.480 --> 01:48.360]  But they're cut off from God, so the globalists don't understand that.
[01:48.360 --> 01:51.360]  Here's what's gonna happen.
[01:51.360 --> 01:58.240]  Whenever I have something that is of the utmost importance, I wouldn't call it choking, but
[01:58.240 --> 02:00.560]  I would call it a form of over-preparing.
[02:00.560 --> 02:07.240]  I sent my alarm clock for 5 a.m. this morning, and I got up again at 5.15, got to the desk,
[02:07.240 --> 02:12.600]  drinking coffee, and reviewed a lot of documents, a lot of legislation that's passed, a lot
[02:12.600 --> 02:16.440]  of defense spending, a lot of intelligence agency spending.
[02:16.440 --> 02:26.040]  And so I put together four or five big stacks here of exhibits, and I tend to, when I put
[02:26.040 --> 02:31.720]  these exhibits together, wait till later in the show to get to them, just because it's
[02:31.720 --> 02:38.600]  so daunting that I'm really gonna try to give my best analysis and my best oratory skills
[02:38.600 --> 02:45.120]  here to tell you the absolute truth, and the problem is there's so much data that I tend
[02:45.120 --> 02:50.520]  to get caught up showing you the proof instead of just telling you what's going on, and then
[02:50.520 --> 02:54.720]  talking about the action we need to take, and then pointing you at an article that has
[02:54.720 --> 02:56.880]  all the links to it and all the admissions.
[02:56.880 --> 03:01.000]  Now, I'm gonna be very clear here.
[03:01.000 --> 03:04.520]  There's one of three things going on with Trump, and we're gonna lay these out when
[03:04.520 --> 03:05.520]  we come back.
[03:05.520 --> 03:15.480]  But now, there's one of three things going on here, one of three things.
[03:15.480 --> 03:21.040]  The president is truly a troglodyte and doesn't understand what's going on in his administration,
[03:21.040 --> 03:33.000]  like they say, or he's working for the bad guys and knows full well what's happening,
[03:33.000 --> 03:39.480]  or he believes that he's gotta head off other big problems first before he addresses this
[03:39.480 --> 03:41.880]  for some reason that escapes me.
[03:41.880 --> 03:46.680]  But I'm not gonna issue an ultimatum to the president.
[03:46.680 --> 03:53.880]  The president has already issued an ultimatum to himself, and so there's that line from
[03:53.880 --> 03:58.000]  a rock song, I forget who said it, but how can we sleep while our beds are burning?
[03:58.000 --> 04:00.800]  I mean, that's really what's going on here.
[04:00.800 --> 04:06.440]  So let me direct all TV viewers and radio listeners and the simulcast to drudgereport.com.
[04:06.440 --> 04:08.440]  We'll put that on screen please.
[04:08.440 --> 04:21.760]  And right in the middle column, right there in the middle column, third article down,
[04:21.760 --> 04:29.840]  fourth article down, new FCC bid to get drudged, they actually say get drudged, and that ties
[04:29.840 --> 04:47.560]  to the article linked below it from infowars.com, update pentagon to fight, pentagon to fight,
[04:47.560 --> 05:00.080]  and that's it.
[05:00.080 --> 05:05.200]  It's been a year since infowars and our other channels were completely banned off of YouTube.
[05:05.200 --> 05:09.320]  We had over 5 billion views when we got banned, and we're credited with getting Donald Trump
[05:09.320 --> 05:13.160]  elected because we were able to punch through and reach the grassroots.
[05:13.160 --> 05:17.440]  Now as we enter the 2020 election cycle, it's more important than ever that there be a place
[05:17.440 --> 05:22.440]  where the censors are unable to block the signal, and it's now here.
[05:22.440 --> 05:23.440]  Band.video.
[05:23.440 --> 05:30.080]  Band.video is the answer for libertarians, conservatives, nationals, pro-gun, pro-life,
[05:30.080 --> 05:36.920]  pro-human individuals to have their own platform where videos banned by YouTube, Facebook, and
[05:36.920 --> 05:38.560]  Twitter are still available.
[05:38.560 --> 05:42.440]  Watch your favorite content for media personalities banned by Big Tech.
[05:42.440 --> 05:43.600]  Works on every device.
[05:43.600 --> 05:46.800]  Take your shows on the go with band.video.

[06:05.680 --> 06:13.200]  Devastating globalist lies, exposing the mainstream media's propaganda machine, tirelessly
[06:13.200 --> 06:20.560]  waging war on corruption, from deep in the heart of FEMA region six in Austin, Texas,
[06:20.560 --> 06:22.400]  transmitting worldwide.
[06:22.400 --> 06:24.480]  It's Alex Jones.
[06:24.480 --> 06:43.960]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[06:43.960 --> 06:50.400]  I'm your host, Alex Jones, and this will be a very important broadcast, like the all
[06:50.400 --> 06:56.000]  time, but this one I've particularly prepared for, and all of this news and information
[06:56.000 --> 07:01.680]  before me, before you, ties together to a very clear picture of where the planet and
[07:01.680 --> 07:03.400]  our species is right now.
[07:03.400 --> 07:07.320]  And it's my main goal to have a discussion about our species, about our past, about our
[07:07.320 --> 07:12.720]  present, about our future, and to try to get you involved in caring about your own destiny
[07:12.720 --> 07:19.240]  and wanting to affect the larger battle space of the future human destiny, or the great
[07:19.240 --> 07:20.600]  mission.
[07:20.600 --> 07:25.640]  Now, let me begin upfront that if we don't have free speech, if we don't have First
[07:25.640 --> 07:31.960]  Amendment, if we can be penalized and persecuted for what we say, then we are living in a true
[07:31.960 --> 07:33.480]  authoritarian regime.
[07:33.480 --> 07:39.480]  And if you look at reports from Discovery Channel, CNN, MSNBC, from even five, six years
[07:39.480 --> 07:45.080]  ago, they were critical of things in China and North Korea and other areas, calling
[07:45.080 --> 07:49.440]  it authoritarianism, calling it oppression, calling it lies.
[07:49.440 --> 07:55.920]  But now, you tune in, and they're promoting persecution, violence against nationalists,
[07:55.920 --> 07:59.000]  against conservatives, against Christians, and others.
[07:59.000 --> 08:04.320]  They have converted to pure authoritarianism, and we know that.
[08:04.320 --> 08:05.320]  And we know why.
[08:05.320 --> 08:09.640]  They're working for a large international cartel of large corporations and banks, allied
[08:09.640 --> 08:16.480]  with the Communist Chinese and the EU, along with Hollywood that they own, dominating and
[08:16.480 --> 08:22.320]  controlling the Western world, sucking out our treasure, our energy, and transferring
[08:22.320 --> 08:28.480]  it to their globalist breakaway civilization, a new feudalist system separate from the general
[08:28.480 --> 08:29.480]  population.
[08:29.480 --> 08:32.400]  Now, that basic statement complete.
[08:32.400 --> 08:37.960]  I am now going to address the President directly, and I have no doubt this will end up getting
[08:37.960 --> 08:42.120]  in front of the President, or he will be briefed on it because I know he's requested that.
[08:42.120 --> 08:48.480]  Let me also direct all TV and radio listeners to DrudgeReport.com.
[08:48.480 --> 08:53.280]  Four stories down in the middle column, but just as important as the fourth story down
[08:53.280 --> 08:56.120]  in the middle column is the story above it.
[08:56.120 --> 09:11.720]  The FCC is holding a symposium, the goal of it is directly to censor the Internet and
[09:11.720 --> 09:17.400]  to put artificial intelligence in charge of it and to end free speech as we know it.
[09:17.400 --> 09:26.720]  They specifically say that Drudge is the target.
[09:26.720 --> 09:27.720]  Now think about that.
[09:27.720 --> 09:36.800]  They are specifically saying that there is a new bid to, quote, get Drudge.
[09:36.800 --> 09:39.880]  They don't even hide it.
[09:39.880 --> 09:43.680]  Of course, I'm mentioned as well.
[09:43.680 --> 09:45.880]  Why is that?
[09:45.880 --> 09:49.960]  Because if what we're saying gets out, it's over for them.
[09:49.960 --> 09:52.000]  That's why they've got to misrepresent us.
[09:52.000 --> 09:53.360]  It's why they've got to lie about us.
[09:53.360 --> 09:54.800]  We're just loyal Americans.
[09:54.800 --> 09:57.960]  This broadcast, our listeners, it's what we do.
[09:57.960 --> 10:01.080]  Now, DrudgeReport.com is a link.
[10:01.080 --> 10:02.920]  This is a participation support.
[10:02.920 --> 10:04.400]  We're not spectators here.
[10:04.400 --> 10:06.600]  You're in the arena, ladies and gentlemen.
[10:06.600 --> 10:11.480]  In the article, Pentagon launches a new program to fight viral Internet content.
[10:11.480 --> 10:13.000]  They say viral.
[10:13.000 --> 10:19.600]  See, the establishment is just mad at anything they don't control.
[10:19.600 --> 10:21.120]  It's not Russian.
[10:21.120 --> 10:23.880]  It's not racist.
[10:23.880 --> 10:28.400]  It's dangerous to the establishment, and they want it shut down.
[10:28.400 --> 10:31.400]  The two articles go together like a horse and carriage.
[10:31.400 --> 10:35.280]  That's why they're right next to each other on DrudgeReport.com.
[10:35.280 --> 10:39.560]  What I'm going to do is I'm going to start it next segment.
[10:39.560 --> 10:45.880]  I direct message to the president and everybody else, but just let me make this announcement
[10:45.880 --> 10:52.400]  before I plunge into all the admissions, all the quotes, all the statements from them in
[10:52.400 --> 10:53.800]  press releases.
[10:53.800 --> 11:01.240]  The neocons and the Democrats openly have a foundation that takes money from 20 foreign
[11:01.240 --> 11:10.880]  countries that then is given CIA and Defense Department money, $2 billion, when Obama left.
[11:10.880 --> 11:17.960]  Most of it's already run out, to pay journalists to lie about yours truly and President Trump.
[11:17.960 --> 11:19.880]  Now, by the way, this is all admitted.
[11:19.880 --> 11:25.960]  I'm going to show you when their own statements in congressional hearings, like this is incredible.
[11:25.960 --> 11:26.960]  Yeah.
[11:26.960 --> 11:30.120]  At one side of their mouth, they go on the national news and say, no one's censoring
[11:30.120 --> 11:34.600]  any nationalist or conservatives or Christians or gun owners or veterans groups.
[11:34.600 --> 11:37.880]  Then out of the other side of their mouth, they have dozens of hearings.
[11:37.880 --> 11:40.280]  We've played you the clips here.
[11:40.280 --> 11:44.560]  And the head of YouTube, you know, on a stage saying, yeah, everybody wanted us to ban
[11:44.560 --> 11:47.840]  Alex Jones, so we banned him.
[11:47.840 --> 11:51.480]  But they go before Congress in one hearing and say to the Republicans, we've never
[11:51.480 --> 11:52.480]  censored anybody.
[11:52.480 --> 11:53.480]  We've never fixed a search result.
[11:53.480 --> 11:54.480]  We've never done anything.
[11:54.480 --> 11:56.480]  We've never breathed oxygen.
[11:56.480 --> 12:02.400]  Then they go into the intelligence and the Armed Services Committees and they openly
[12:02.400 --> 12:10.240]  talk about how with foreign governments, 20 governments at least have ganged up on the
[12:10.240 --> 12:18.000]  American people, the Germans, the British, the Swedish government, the Saudi Arabian
[12:18.000 --> 12:19.000]  government.
[12:19.000 --> 12:21.400]  I'm going to read you from their own documents.
[12:21.400 --> 12:27.000]  So you talk about foreign collusion, you talk about election meddling.
[12:27.000 --> 12:33.040]  And so there's President Trump talking about Google censorship and Facebook censorship.
[12:33.040 --> 12:35.720]  It's beyond that.
[12:35.720 --> 12:39.480]  And they say in the quotes in congressional testimony that we're going to read to you
[12:39.480 --> 12:41.840]  and find the videos as well.
[12:41.840 --> 12:44.680]  We've played them.
[12:44.680 --> 12:50.680]  That anything that is not establishment talking points, these are quotes, or anything not
[12:50.680 --> 12:55.840]  approved by these committees will not be allowed on air.
[12:55.840 --> 13:01.600]  And then they've got other quotes here that are just so astounding.
[13:01.600 --> 13:09.400]  They make my head spin, but we're going to go over all of this where they have quotes
[13:09.400 --> 13:17.560]  in here where they say the CIA and the Atlantic Council's main mission is to prevent the
[13:17.560 --> 13:24.440]  foment of discord, that's Rolling Stone, by the way, quoting that from the congressional
[13:24.440 --> 13:25.440]  testimony.
[13:25.440 --> 13:31.560]  Now, now you understand that saying anything they think can upset somebody like, hey, that
[13:31.560 --> 13:34.560]  to our work, said he's coming for your guns, he will confiscate all semi-autos.
[13:34.560 --> 13:36.960]  Oh, that's fomenting.
[13:36.960 --> 13:40.640]  Hey, Hillary fell down in New York City, had a convulsion, Alex Jones is right.
[13:40.640 --> 13:43.240]  Oh, that's fomenting.
[13:43.240 --> 13:49.400]  Oh, and somebody, hey, we got delicious cheeseburgers and ice cold Coca-Cola's on sale for $2 over
[13:49.400 --> 13:51.040]  here at the local restaurant.
[13:51.040 --> 13:53.160]  That's fomenting.
[13:53.160 --> 13:55.680]  And you read it, and who do they say?
[13:55.680 --> 14:01.240]  Matt Drudge, Alex Jones, so cryptic, so evil, so disgusting.
[14:01.240 --> 14:06.040]  And that's because Drudge is the biggest thing out there, any other news outlet directing
[14:06.040 --> 14:09.600]  raw traffic, and then in full force talks to the grassroots of the nation.
[14:09.600 --> 14:15.280]  And because we're loyal Americans that are also loyal to our own common sense and free
[14:15.280 --> 14:20.480]  market and want to live in a quasi-free country, we must be silent because you can't buy me,
[14:20.480 --> 14:25.880]  and you can obviously see you can't buy Drudge, you can't buy Tucker Carlson, I know the inside
[14:25.880 --> 14:29.480]  baseball on that, they threaten to fire him, you name it, he won't shut up or back down.
[14:29.480 --> 14:34.920]  And then with Sean Hannity, you may disagree with us on a point or two, but we're not
[14:34.920 --> 14:40.080]  back and down, we're not selling out, but I gotta ask the president something, do you
[14:40.080 --> 14:45.440]  know that there's $2 billion in government right now and 20 foreign governments funding
[14:45.440 --> 14:49.040]  to make sure you lose the election and Google's on record admitting it, and they're meeting
[14:49.040 --> 14:54.080]  with the FCC to do it and threatening the families of the conservative members of the
[14:54.080 --> 14:55.760]  FCC?
[14:55.760 --> 15:04.600]  I know people on the FCC, oh yeah, I know FCC board members, yeah, I've had hour-long
[15:04.600 --> 15:11.880]  discussions, oh you didn't know that did you, yeah, in the last two years, yeah, their
[15:11.880 --> 15:20.200]  children get death-threaded at work, at school, yeah, it's serious, oh you saw what happened
[15:20.200 --> 15:24.280]  to Scalise, gotta happen to your kids, you don't get in line and help us get rid of
[15:24.280 --> 15:29.440]  Trump, so you wonder why Trump's doing so much good and proving he's the real deal,
[15:29.440 --> 15:32.920]  but he can't get Washington to do one-tenth of what he wants, it's because they're threatening
[15:32.920 --> 15:39.800]  to kill everybody, you understand now, now if you wanna live under something like that
[15:39.800 --> 15:44.600]  and you wanna buckle and get bullied, it's only gonna get worse, I know what to do to
[15:44.600 --> 15:49.600]  a bully, I'm gonna jump on top of them politically and I'm gonna grab them by the ears and I'm
[15:49.600 --> 15:53.680]  gonna ram their head in the concrete till blood comes out of their eyes, politically,
[15:53.680 --> 16:00.600]  non-violently, they wanna try to intimidate me, attention GCN self-reliance listeners,
[16:00.600 --> 16:05.080]  if you've ever wanted an emergency solar survival backup system but we're waiting for prices
[16:05.080 --> 16:09.160]  too crazy to pass up, this will be the most important message you'll ever hear.
[16:09.160 --> 16:13.040]  Bill Hyde here and I wanna tell you about a huge sale with historically low prices on
[16:13.040 --> 16:17.640]  our PPX microgrid system that's gonna let you produce an endless supply of electricity
[16:17.640 --> 16:21.840]  off the grid, the clearance price is a result of the historic flooding we're having here
[16:21.840 --> 16:25.200]  right on the east bank of the Mississippi, because of the flooding we've had to move
[16:25.200 --> 16:29.760]  a lot of our inventory to a temporary location and rather than move it back to the warehouse
[16:29.760 --> 16:34.160]  we thought we'd offer the system at a price that might seem unbelievable if you didn't

[19:13.400 --> 19:16.840]  It is cold pressed, it takes at least three times

[20:35.560 --> 20:39.160]  and we win, ladies and gentlemen.
[20:39.160 --> 20:44.920]  We know that we can defeat tyranny of good men and women,
[20:44.920 --> 20:47.160]  get informed, and take action.
[20:47.160 --> 20:50.480]  We're doing it now.
[20:50.480 --> 20:53.760]  All right, let's get right into it, ladies and gentlemen.
[20:53.760 --> 20:55.880]  Sure, we all know that there's massive censorship
[20:55.880 --> 21:00.080]  against conservatives and against nationalists
[21:00.080 --> 21:02.600]  and against patriots and against people that just
[21:02.600 --> 21:05.640]  want to be sovereign and run their own lives
[21:05.640 --> 21:07.360]  and that love America.
[21:07.360 --> 21:09.800]  We know that the American system threatens the globalist
[21:09.800 --> 21:14.120]  system that has been manifest in communist China.
[21:14.120 --> 21:15.520]  That's what they'd like to do here,
[21:15.520 --> 21:18.200]  and it's what they are setting up for the global social score
[21:18.200 --> 21:22.760]  and system where now they're in Yahoo and Bloomberg Finance
[21:22.760 --> 21:24.200]  going, well, it's true.
[21:24.200 --> 21:26.480]  All the big tech heads for a decade
[21:26.480 --> 21:29.160]  have been in a race to listen and record everything you do,
[21:29.160 --> 21:32.160]  and they've all got big data banks of what you said,
[21:32.160 --> 21:33.560]  so you better watch your mouth.
[21:33.560 --> 21:35.560]  And Facebook came out three months ago
[21:35.560 --> 21:37.240]  when they said, don't use Alex Jones' name,
[21:37.240 --> 21:41.840]  and they said, we'll ban you off Facebook for anything
[21:41.840 --> 21:44.320]  you said in the past, and watch out.
[21:44.320 --> 21:46.280]  We've got blackmail on all of America.
[21:46.280 --> 21:47.280]  They actually said that.
[21:47.280 --> 21:50.120]  Go look it up.
[21:50.120 --> 21:52.880]  And Facebook came out today and said, what YouTube said,
[21:52.880 --> 21:56.640]  we're experimenting with getting rid of the likes,
[21:56.640 --> 21:59.720]  because when Obama gives a speech now, maybe 1,000 people
[21:59.720 --> 22:02.440]  watching on YouTube, it's going to be a big hit.
[22:02.440 --> 22:04.480]  They're going to watch it on YouTube, even though they put
[22:04.480 --> 22:08.320]  it on the front, and it'll get thousands of dislikes,
[22:08.320 --> 22:10.840]  to maybe five likes.
[22:10.840 --> 22:12.920]  Same thing when they put up all this anti-American,
[22:12.920 --> 22:16.640]  anti-God, anti-family stuff on Netflix,
[22:16.640 --> 22:20.440]  they'll get half a star out of five stars
[22:20.440 --> 22:21.880]  for all these six shows.
[22:21.880 --> 22:24.040]  And so they go, oh, we're just getting rid of stars
[22:24.040 --> 22:25.520]  on those shows.
[22:25.520 --> 22:28.320]  So see, they're censoring it down to the level
[22:28.320 --> 22:32.520]  that consumer groups now are being shut down on Facebook
[22:32.520 --> 22:36.160]  and Twitter, because they allow people to vote on whether
[22:36.160 --> 22:42.040]  they like to deodorant, or a hair dryer, or a drug they took.
[22:42.040 --> 22:44.360]  Well, we can't have you say your daughter took a
[22:44.360 --> 22:48.520]  Gardasil shot and died, or took a Gardasil shot and got
[22:48.520 --> 22:51.800]  cancer, or had a convulsion.
[22:51.800 --> 22:54.240]  They're silencing everyone.
[22:54.240 --> 22:56.600]  They brought the web in, made it all where we could vote
[22:56.600 --> 22:58.240]  on things, share what we liked.
[22:58.240 --> 23:00.240]  It was open, it was free to a great extent,
[23:00.240 --> 23:03.280]  and now they're pulling the rug out from under us.
[23:03.280 --> 23:05.200]  They got us addicted.
[23:05.200 --> 23:11.360]  When they invented the concept of the internet in 1962,
[23:11.360 --> 23:16.000]  it's called the Intergalactic Communications System.
[23:16.000 --> 23:18.320]  Wasn't built by DARPA to survive a nuclear war.
[23:18.320 --> 23:20.360]  That was propaganda later put out.
[23:20.360 --> 23:23.440]  The mainline history is it was designed, the idea,
[23:23.440 --> 23:27.200]  by a psychiatrist working with DARPA,
[23:27.200 --> 23:30.800]  who wanted to track propaganda and how it affected you to
[23:30.800 --> 23:34.360]  then try to harness mass movements and be able to predict
[23:34.360 --> 23:38.160]  the future once everyone had a handheld computer that they
[23:38.160 --> 23:41.040]  believed you would then go interface with terminals for
[23:41.040 --> 23:42.120]  downloads and uploads.
[23:42.120 --> 23:44.680]  Now they just do it wireless.
[23:44.680 --> 23:49.640]  I can show you 1970s and 80s TV shows about it.
[23:49.640 --> 23:52.400]  PBS programs with futurist about how they planned it in the
[23:52.400 --> 23:58.200]  1960s, it's designed to enslave you from the beginning.
[23:58.200 --> 24:01.520]  Now, we took it away from them to a great extent,
[24:01.520 --> 24:03.480]  so now they're accelerating the original plan that wasn't
[24:03.480 --> 24:06.440]  supposed to be here for other 10 years.
[24:06.440 --> 24:07.840]  But they're going for it all now.
[24:07.840 --> 24:09.720]  It's all over the news.
[24:09.720 --> 24:16.960]  Oh, Samsung and Apple and Sharp and Google and Twitter and
[24:16.960 --> 24:23.520]  Amazon and every major company, more than 50,
[24:23.520 --> 24:27.960]  are competing to listen and watch you and sell the data to
[24:27.960 --> 24:33.960]  big data crunching firms and the National Security Agency.
[24:33.960 --> 24:36.280]  They could never get away with that.
[24:36.280 --> 24:39.920]  But if they got you to opt in to YouTube and Google and
[24:39.920 --> 24:43.560]  Alphabet and Facebook and Twitter and all the rest, then
[24:43.560 --> 24:46.920]  you don't read the 20, 30 pages when it gives you a
[24:46.920 --> 24:48.160]  software update.
[24:48.160 --> 24:51.920]  It tells you they're watching and listening.
[24:51.920 --> 24:55.040]  But now, you see, they get you addicted first and now
[24:55.040 --> 24:58.360]  Google and Amazon use smart speakers for surveillance.
[24:58.360 --> 25:04.320]  Top tech investor says, Yahoo, Bloomberg.
[25:04.320 --> 25:05.640]  All over the place.
[25:05.640 --> 25:08.760]  This weekend, it was the top story starting Friday.
[25:08.760 --> 25:11.440]  It's time to tell you now.
[25:11.440 --> 25:18.160]  Member InfoWars telling you 20 years ago, it was decided
[25:18.160 --> 25:21.880]  at that point that I was endangering infrastructure.
[25:21.880 --> 25:25.080]  And the Pentagon was sent to have a meeting with the local
[25:25.080 --> 25:28.040]  radio station, despite the fact I had the number one ratings.
[25:28.040 --> 25:29.960]  And I was getting national news attention.
[25:29.960 --> 25:32.360]  They fired me.
[25:32.360 --> 25:33.160]  They gave me a few months.
[25:33.160 --> 25:39.360]  They said, no more talk about all these things, like the
[25:39.360 --> 25:43.000]  microphone in the scientific Atlantic cable box that the
[25:43.000 --> 25:50.040]  engineer came and broke open for me and showed me with the
[25:50.040 --> 25:51.800]  blueprints saying microphone.
[25:55.360 --> 25:58.880]  Long before you're using voice print, you see.
[25:58.880 --> 25:59.800]  But see, that was backed in.
[25:59.800 --> 26:00.480]  You weren't supposed to know.
[26:00.480 --> 26:02.600]  Oh, there'd never be a microphone that came back in.
[26:02.600 --> 26:06.600]  But now, you've been slowly conditioned to accept it.
[26:06.600 --> 26:08.320]  So I've got hundreds of articles here.
[26:08.320 --> 26:09.480]  I'm going to go over it.
[26:09.480 --> 26:12.000]  First, when we come back, I'm already starting to get into
[26:12.000 --> 26:18.240]  it, my direct message to the president himself, because just
[26:18.240 --> 26:25.960]  Google and Facebook are where 70% of where people in the
[26:25.960 --> 26:31.960]  United States get their news, 70% get their news solely from
[26:31.960 --> 26:34.800]  Google and Facebook.
[26:34.800 --> 26:38.560]  Now, Trump, who watches TV, still thinks the internet's
[26:38.560 --> 26:44.200]  like some junior Bush League, lowest level minor league.
[26:48.640 --> 26:49.280]  It's not.
[26:49.280 --> 26:51.640]  It's the big leagues.
[26:51.640 --> 26:55.920]  And it controls everything that the people can see and do.
[26:55.920 --> 26:58.720]  And then the fact that Trump hasn't acted, they're so
[26:58.720 --> 27:01.640]  arrogant now, they're blocking all these political
[27:01.640 --> 27:05.400]  peoples' Twitter's and Facebook's, including the leader of the Senate.
[27:05.400 --> 27:12.040]  And Democrats that aren't establishment, like the good
[27:12.040 --> 27:18.240]  Congresswoman from Hawaii, and still nothing's done.
[27:18.240 --> 27:24.120]  And so now, the FCC announces that they're having a
[27:24.120 --> 27:29.360]  symposium to, quote, shut down anything viral in Matt Drudge.
[27:29.360 --> 27:31.360]  These are quotes.
[27:31.360 --> 27:33.680]  I'm sorry, get Drudge.
[27:33.680 --> 27:37.280]  We're going to get you.
[27:37.280 --> 27:38.880]  And why shouldn't they be?
[27:38.880 --> 27:41.040]  They chastise people in Congress every month.
[27:41.040 --> 27:42.440]  I see a new video going.
[27:42.440 --> 27:44.200]  Alex Jones is still online.
[27:44.200 --> 27:45.120]  We want him shut down.
[27:45.120 --> 27:47.440]  We're working on it, sir.
[27:47.440 --> 27:49.640]  Senator Blumenthal's like, good, get it done quicker.
[27:53.320 --> 27:58.000]  And they're doing it to everybody now.
[27:58.000 --> 28:03.360]  Down to Facebook announcing that they're experimenting,
[28:03.360 --> 28:08.120]  getting rid of likes, because they don't like the fact that you
[28:08.120 --> 28:10.520]  can tell people as a human what you like.
[28:10.520 --> 28:11.680]  Talk about tyranny.
[28:11.680 --> 28:15.840]  Someone in a prison can, through the bars, up or down their
[28:15.840 --> 28:20.440]  fingers, or can boo if they don't get their lunch or dinner.
[28:20.440 --> 28:24.200]  But you won't have the rights of a prisoner in a maximum
[28:24.200 --> 28:28.960]  security prison.
[28:28.960 --> 28:31.680]  And these arrogant technocrats believe they've already
[28:31.680 --> 28:35.280]  broken away from humanity, and we're in the post-human world.
[28:35.280 --> 28:39.560]  Megalomania, their right will not last 1,000 years.
[28:39.560 --> 28:41.480]  It will not last 100 years.
[28:41.480 --> 28:43.560]  It will not last 20 years.
[28:43.560 --> 28:45.800]  When they establish their world government,
[28:45.800 --> 28:49.040]  it will last one year.
[28:49.040 --> 28:52.280]  And 4 million people will be killed during that period.
[28:52.280 --> 28:54.240]  So sayeth the Lord.
[28:57.760 --> 29:00.520]  Finally, there's a way for you to get into the blockchain,
[29:00.520 --> 29:03.560]  the hottest financial sector without all the speculation.
[29:03.560 --> 29:06.920]  No, enjoy a 27% annualized payment each month
[29:06.920 --> 29:08.680]  without the ups and downs of Bitcoin.

[29:14.040 --> 29:16.360]  in the explosive digital asset marketplace.
[29:16.360 --> 29:18.880]  Inspired by entrepreneurs who sold picks and shovels
[29:18.880 --> 29:21.480]  during the gold rush, the money is in the mining equipment
[29:21.480 --> 29:24.440]  used to manufacture dozens of critical digital assets.
[29:24.440 --> 29:27.320]  Non-security IPO or note, blockchain data centers

[29:30.120 --> 29:33.760]  with a 27% annualized lease payment deposited

[29:53.920 --> 29:55.880]  before purchasing not an offer to buy or sell a security
[29:55.880 --> 29:57.560]  which requires an offering document.
[29:58.840 --> 30:00.040]  Let's apologize if I bought some wits.
[30:00.040 --> 30:02.640]  Summit.News and Action 7 News were here in Hong Kong.
[30:02.640 --> 30:05.080]  This is Savannah Hernandez for infowars.com.

[30:16.800 --> 30:20.440]  Despite being the most banned broadcast in the free world,
[30:20.440 --> 30:22.640]  we continue to win because of our great,
[30:22.640 --> 30:24.840]  strong, loyal audience.
[30:24.840 --> 30:28.080]  We have Dan Lyman covering infowars Europe,
[30:28.080 --> 30:30.600]  Paul Joseph Watson in the UK,
[30:30.600 --> 30:34.160]  Millie Weaver and Caitlin Bennett in the American Heartland
[30:34.160 --> 30:37.560]  and from Austin, Texas, a team of reporters and crew
[30:37.560 --> 30:41.320]  ready to be dispatched wherever the story is going down.
[30:41.320 --> 30:43.960]  We are not done winning and with your support,
[30:43.960 --> 30:45.080]  we will keep winning.
[30:45.080 --> 30:46.480]  We have to keep winning.
[30:46.480 --> 30:47.960]  We have to win more.
[30:47.960 --> 30:50.360]  Go to infowarsstore.com.
[30:50.360 --> 30:53.440]  You have gone to infowarsstore.com
[30:53.440 --> 30:55.960]  and gotten books and films, supplements and t-shirts
[30:55.960 --> 30:59.160]  and water filtration, air filtration and things you need.
[30:59.160 --> 31:02.400]  Supermail Vitality is already in the top three
[31:02.400 --> 31:05.240]  of our best sellers for the six years we've had it.
[31:05.240 --> 31:09.280]  It is a award-winning formula produced in Utah
[31:09.280 --> 31:11.760]  by one of the top herbal companies in the nation
[31:11.760 --> 31:13.440]  that we've been private labeling.
[31:13.440 --> 31:14.720]  It is cold pressed.
[31:14.720 --> 31:17.880]  It takes at least three times the herbs
[31:17.880 --> 31:20.080]  that are wild crafted and organic
[31:20.080 --> 31:21.200]  to be able to produce this.
[31:21.200 --> 31:22.360]  It's not boiled.
[31:22.360 --> 31:23.160]  It's not heated.
[31:23.160 --> 31:24.320]  It's never been dried.
[31:24.320 --> 31:26.840]  It's taken from fresh herbs.
[31:26.840 --> 31:29.520]  That's why it's so strong.
[31:29.520 --> 31:33.280]  That's why it's so effective for libido, stamina and energy.
[31:33.280 --> 31:36.480]  And I'm so excited about Supermail Vitality
[31:36.480 --> 31:41.040]  and Carnivore 30 that I'm offering you with every order
[31:41.040 --> 31:44.640]  of Supermail Vitality at 25% off a free bottle
[31:44.640 --> 31:47.320]  of Carnivore Digestive Enzyme.
[31:47.320 --> 31:49.240]  We're gonna sell out of this very quickly,
[31:49.240 --> 31:51.280]  but it's an offer so that you experience
[31:51.280 --> 31:53.520]  how amazing both these products are.
[31:53.520 --> 31:58.520]  Secure yours at m4store.com today or m4slife.com.
[31:58.840 --> 32:03.240]  Band.video is the answer to censorship.
[32:03.240 --> 32:06.840]  Band.video is the answer for libertarians,
[32:06.840 --> 32:09.880]  conservatives, nationalists, pro-gun, pro-life,
[32:09.880 --> 32:14.120]  pro-human individuals to have their own platform
[32:14.120 --> 32:17.480]  where videos banned by YouTube, Facebook and Twitter
[32:17.480 --> 32:18.760]  are still available.
[32:18.760 --> 32:20.360]  We've launched it, ladies and gentlemen.
[32:20.360 --> 32:21.760]  It's now live.
[32:21.760 --> 32:23.680]  Band.video.
[32:23.680 --> 32:26.640]  Band.video isn't just going to be a home
[32:26.640 --> 32:29.200]  for Alex Jones or David Knight or Owen Schreuer
[32:29.200 --> 32:31.040]  or Paul Watson banned videos.
[32:31.040 --> 32:34.280]  We are building it to be a place where banned memes
[32:34.280 --> 32:36.840]  are able to be posted and where a growing list
[32:36.840 --> 32:40.240]  of freedom-loving contributors are able to have a home
[32:40.240 --> 32:43.400]  free from being shut down, free from being censored,
[32:43.400 --> 32:46.720]  free from being silenced by Big Tech, the Chai Coms,
[32:46.720 --> 32:48.840]  the Hollywood scum and the globalist.
[32:48.840 --> 32:51.080]  Freedom of speech has a home.
[32:51.080 --> 32:53.560]  It's called band.video.
[32:53.560 --> 32:56.720]  America and the world is fighting back against tyranny
[32:56.720 --> 32:58.440]  at band.video.
[33:01.320 --> 33:04.400]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[33:04.400 --> 33:17.720]  MUSIC
[33:17.720 --> 33:20.040]  Waging war on corruption.
[33:20.040 --> 33:21.520]  It's Alex Jones.
[33:25.520 --> 33:27.920]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[33:27.920 --> 33:31.880]  We're here live every Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[33:31.880 --> 33:32.680]  to 3 p.m. Central.
[33:32.680 --> 33:34.400]  I come back Sundays, 4 to 6 p.m.
[33:34.400 --> 33:37.080]  We kick off the live shows here every day morning
[33:37.080 --> 33:39.720]  with a powerful transmission with David Knight,
[33:39.720 --> 33:40.960]  the David Knight show.
[33:40.960 --> 33:43.320]  And of course, after I go off at 3 p.m. Central,
[33:43.320 --> 33:46.000]  Owen Schreuer knocking out of the park with the war room
[33:46.000 --> 33:47.680]  and new shows to be announced just here
[33:47.680 --> 33:49.440]  in the next four or five days.
[33:49.440 --> 33:50.880]  So get ready for that.
[33:50.880 --> 33:53.200]  infowars.com, newswars.com.
[33:53.200 --> 33:56.320]  So I've kind of set the table the last couple segments
[33:56.320 --> 33:59.080]  with some of the history, the basic facts.
[33:59.080 --> 34:03.240]  There is a arms race, you could say,
[34:03.240 --> 34:05.880]  for who will control the technocracy,
[34:05.880 --> 34:10.600]  what company can get its robot in your house that spies on you
[34:10.600 --> 34:13.680]  and tracks you and sells data on you,
[34:13.680 --> 34:18.160]  and which robot can get you to use it as an assistant
[34:18.160 --> 34:20.520]  to buy the products directly from that robot?
[34:20.520 --> 34:23.200]  That's what Amazon's whole model is.
[34:23.200 --> 34:24.640]  And it says it on the plastic bags
[34:24.640 --> 34:26.440]  they give you at Whole Foods.
[34:26.440 --> 34:29.680]  It says it on Amazon, hey, when you need avocados,
[34:29.680 --> 34:34.000]  tell Alexa, Alexa, I need avocados.
[34:34.000 --> 34:37.120]  That's all part of the quote, Alexa training.
[34:37.120 --> 34:39.680]  But Alexa's training you.
[34:39.680 --> 34:41.640]  And it's come out what I told you years ago.
[34:41.640 --> 34:43.720]  All these companies, going back to Google Assist
[34:43.720 --> 34:47.160]  five years ago, are listening and are watching
[34:47.160 --> 34:48.080]  and are selling your data.
[34:48.080 --> 34:49.840]  And of course, people are listening.
[34:49.840 --> 34:52.280]  It's incredibly valuable.
[34:52.280 --> 34:54.160]  They're recording everything in live time.
[34:54.160 --> 34:56.120]  Transcripts are created.
[34:56.120 --> 35:00.200]  And they simply search keywords by Control-F.
[35:00.200 --> 35:01.960]  That was 20 years ago, 30 years ago then
[35:01.960 --> 35:04.000]  as a technology with these systems.
[35:04.000 --> 35:07.240]  Now, AI tells them which areas to look at.
[35:07.240 --> 35:08.440]  And it's all highlighted.
[35:08.440 --> 35:11.280]  And they wish to hear the actual audio.
[35:11.280 --> 35:13.720]  I've taught people that work there at Amazon and Google.
[35:13.720 --> 35:15.720]  You just click on the word at the point
[35:15.720 --> 35:19.280]  and it starts playing the audio from that point.
[35:19.280 --> 35:21.360]  And a lot of these have video now.
[35:21.360 --> 35:22.240]  A lot of these assistants.
[35:22.240 --> 35:27.520]  So they click it and it's all there on the timeline.
[35:27.520 --> 35:30.560]  And then they report on bugs, glitches, problems.
[35:30.560 --> 35:33.440]  And so here's my message to the president.
[35:33.440 --> 35:37.680]  Mr. President, I understand that the architecture of the world
[35:37.680 --> 35:38.480]  is a technocracy.
[35:38.480 --> 35:41.680]  I understand that 50 years ago it was decided to build this.
[35:41.680 --> 35:43.840]  I understand that everything's wired into it.
[35:43.840 --> 35:47.440]  I understand now it's a race between us and the Chinese
[35:47.440 --> 35:49.000]  and a few corporations for who will
[35:49.000 --> 35:51.720]  have the most powerful AI.
[35:51.720 --> 35:52.600]  That is a trap.
[35:52.600 --> 35:54.840]  And I'll use the Lord of the Rings analogy, the allegory.
[35:54.840 --> 35:57.520]  But we have mainline historical ones.
[35:57.520 --> 36:00.520]  You've got the rings handed out that have all these powers
[36:00.520 --> 36:03.960]  to the men, to the dwarves, to the elves.
[36:03.960 --> 36:06.320]  But of course, in the dark, one ring
[36:06.320 --> 36:10.360]  is forged to rule them and in the darkness, bind them.
[36:10.360 --> 36:12.320]  And all of these things have backdoors.
[36:12.320 --> 36:15.400]  All of these things are older technologies that are already
[36:15.400 --> 36:16.640]  obsolete that were given.
[36:16.640 --> 36:19.720]  And there's way more advanced systems that are admitted to,
[36:19.720 --> 36:21.880]  and many that aren't admitted to, that are taking place
[36:21.880 --> 36:22.640]  and going on.
[36:22.640 --> 36:25.440]  So like I told you 25 years ago about human animal clones,
[36:25.440 --> 36:26.440]  that was in the literature.
[36:26.440 --> 36:28.240]  It was going on.
[36:28.240 --> 36:30.320]  And it's said 20 years before.
[36:30.320 --> 36:34.760]  So that's 45 years ago MIT had met human animal clones
[36:34.760 --> 36:36.240]  in the test tube.
[36:36.240 --> 36:38.680]  Obviously, they put them inside cows and gestated them
[36:38.680 --> 36:39.200]  and grew them.
[36:39.200 --> 36:40.880]  And that's now admitted as well.
[36:40.880 --> 36:45.640]  So everything's 30, 40 years advanced.
[36:45.640 --> 36:47.920]  And as the singularity accelerates,
[36:47.920 --> 36:50.960]  I call it a cascade of singularities, sub-singularities.
[36:50.960 --> 36:53.080]  But I do believe in the singularity,
[36:53.080 --> 36:54.800]  not in this dimension, but higher dimensions.
[36:54.800 --> 36:56.440]  It'll take a lot longer than they're saying.
[36:56.440 --> 36:58.360]  But there will be chain reaction singularities
[36:58.360 --> 37:00.440]  that cause major disruptions.
[37:00.440 --> 37:02.640]  And the globalists are actually engineering this system
[37:02.640 --> 37:05.760]  to be disruptive and to create a post-human world.
[37:05.760 --> 37:07.760]  And during the resource cutoff period,
[37:07.760 --> 37:10.040]  and during humans becoming obsolete period,
[37:10.040 --> 37:12.800]  and during humans becoming so decadent and slob-like,
[37:12.800 --> 37:15.360]  like the movie Wally laying around,
[37:15.360 --> 37:17.960]  those that are in the establishment system,
[37:17.960 --> 37:20.600]  there will be a lot of humans that actually want
[37:20.600 --> 37:23.560]  the extermination system and to have the plague that
[37:23.560 --> 37:25.400]  is humanity removed because we're
[37:25.400 --> 37:29.400]  going to be turned into a plague before we're removed.
[37:29.400 --> 37:32.760]  That's the alchemy, is to get us to accept a fallen state,
[37:32.760 --> 37:35.560]  a fallen nature, to fall even further
[37:35.560 --> 37:39.800]  so that it's metaphysically justice when we are destroyed,
[37:39.800 --> 37:43.080]  tricking us to commit sins against the planet,
[37:43.080 --> 37:48.440]  sins against the innocent, sins against ourselves.
[37:48.440 --> 37:52.440]  These are rituals to remove the protection.
[37:52.440 --> 37:54.320]  And once the protection is removed, it's over.
[37:54.320 --> 37:59.240]  So it's important to set the basis of this up.
[37:59.240 --> 38:01.880]  I'm not cliffhangering here for my message to the president,
[38:01.880 --> 38:04.800]  but I think I officially need to do that and then cut that out
[38:04.800 --> 38:07.200]  and have it sent to the White House when we come back
[38:07.200 --> 38:09.840]  from break because I want to specifically get
[38:09.840 --> 38:10.840]  into the main message here.
[38:10.840 --> 38:15.000]  But let me just give you a prelude or an hors d'oeuvre of it.
[38:15.000 --> 38:18.600]  It's very simple, but it's not being talked about.
[38:18.600 --> 38:22.440]  The government is running the censorship.
[38:22.440 --> 38:23.680]  It's beyond censorship.
[38:23.680 --> 38:27.080]  It's total information control.
[38:27.080 --> 38:30.840]  And it's a consortium of think tanks, foreign governments,
[38:30.840 --> 38:35.880]  the United Nations, quarter backed by the State Department
[38:35.880 --> 38:39.360]  and by the Carnegie, Ford, and Rockefeller brothers endowments.
[38:39.360 --> 38:42.040]  And I've got all of it here I'm going to show you.
[38:42.040 --> 38:43.760]  And so for Trump to set up there and say, yeah,
[38:43.760 --> 38:47.040]  Google's out of control, Facebook's out of control,
[38:47.040 --> 38:49.120]  Twitter's out of control, that's nothing.
[38:52.520 --> 38:55.000]  They are ending the complete architecture of the internet.
[38:55.000 --> 38:57.720]  They are coming after everyone that has independent sites.
[38:57.720 --> 39:00.200]  They are announcing plans that have already passed laws
[39:00.200 --> 39:02.200]  in Europe to ban memes.
[39:02.200 --> 39:05.600]  That's just cave drawings, basic human communication
[39:05.600 --> 39:07.040]  because they're removing language,
[39:07.040 --> 39:11.960]  but still there's the most ancient form of communication,
[39:11.960 --> 39:18.000]  cave drawings, or hieroglyphs, tune a form.
[39:18.000 --> 39:20.440]  This is such an alien attack, ladies and gentlemen.
[39:20.440 --> 39:22.120]  If you look at the profile of it, everything,
[39:22.120 --> 39:23.760]  I don't look for flying saucers.
[39:23.760 --> 39:24.920]  I don't look for little green men.
[39:24.920 --> 39:26.480]  Whatever you want to call this, this
[39:26.480 --> 39:28.120]  is how you kill a species.
[39:28.120 --> 39:30.800]  This is how you dumb them down, turn them against themselves,
[39:30.800 --> 39:34.080]  kill their fertility, destroy their will to build,
[39:34.080 --> 39:35.280]  and turn us against ourselves.
[39:35.280 --> 39:38.400]  It's just, it's the devil.
[39:38.400 --> 39:42.960]  The off-world, fallen one, here to kill, steal, and destroy.
[39:42.960 --> 39:45.200]  Here to stop us from our launch phase.
[39:45.200 --> 39:46.920]  We're vast approaching.
[39:46.920 --> 39:52.720]  So I'll hit it when we come back and I'll get in the specifics.
[39:52.720 --> 39:54.480]  But if you go to drudgereport.com,
[39:54.480 --> 39:56.040]  it's right in the middle column.
[39:56.040 --> 39:57.920]  We'll put that up on screen please.
[39:57.920 --> 40:00.320]  And you can go to that article that's
[40:00.320 --> 40:06.920]  Paul Joseph Watson's article, Pentagon launches
[40:06.920 --> 40:11.600]  a new program to fight viral internet content.
[40:11.600 --> 40:13.000]  DARPA declares war on memes.
[40:13.000 --> 40:15.240]  Now why is this article so important?
[40:15.240 --> 40:21.280]  When you scroll down, there is a video
[40:21.280 --> 40:27.040]  that is a feed of the live show.
[40:27.040 --> 40:30.560]  And that's how we reach new people.
[40:30.560 --> 40:31.840]  And you see the write up under it.
[40:31.840 --> 40:35.680]  Alex Jones is live right now, breaking down.
[40:35.680 --> 40:39.200]  Clinton Obama networks still inside US intelligence
[40:39.200 --> 40:45.880]  agencies pushing internet censorship
[40:45.880 --> 40:50.160]  and a complete takeover of the web,
[40:50.160 --> 40:54.120]  the establishment of total information awareness
[40:54.120 --> 40:57.440]  and total information control.
[40:57.440 --> 41:00.080]  That is what the Pentagon calls it.
[41:00.080 --> 41:04.800]  And they see nationalist and patriots
[41:04.800 --> 41:08.800]  who want to control our country as disruptive and as illegal.
[41:08.800 --> 41:10.760]  Now it's not the Pentagon itself that's bad,
[41:10.760 --> 41:12.280]  but it's the people in control of it.
[41:12.280 --> 41:16.160]  And Trump is not in control of the Pentagon.
[41:16.160 --> 41:19.000]  The globalist are in control at the top.
[41:19.000 --> 41:21.240]  And Trump's ideas are right.
[41:21.240 --> 41:22.920]  He's steering us in the right direction.
[41:22.920 --> 41:24.200]  But it's not fast enough.
[41:24.200 --> 41:27.000]  And this is such a serious time to be alive.
[41:27.000 --> 41:29.560]  So please go to drudgereport.com or infowars.com
[41:29.560 --> 41:30.360]  or newswars.com.
[41:30.360 --> 41:33.120]  The power of we the people.
[41:33.120 --> 41:35.240]  The power of you sharing that live link.
[41:35.240 --> 41:36.840]  In fact, the newswars.com link.
[41:36.840 --> 41:38.160]  Let's put that on screen.
[41:38.160 --> 41:40.960]  Newswars.com doesn't get it censored by the bots.
[41:40.960 --> 41:43.240]  Doesn't get it blocked by the bots.
[41:43.240 --> 41:45.640]  Still can get out easier on Twitter and Facebook.
[41:45.640 --> 41:47.480]  Still can be shared on emails and things
[41:47.480 --> 41:49.040]  where if you're Google email, they read your email
[41:49.040 --> 41:50.040]  and block stuff now.
[41:50.040 --> 41:51.920]  This is all such a violation of your rights.
[41:51.920 --> 41:53.800]  This is just rubbing your nose in it.
[41:53.800 --> 41:56.520]  Pentagon launches a new program to fight viral internet content.
[41:59.120 --> 42:00.400]  And they admit that's what it is.
[42:00.400 --> 42:02.000]  So claiming it's to fight the Russians,
[42:02.000 --> 42:05.040]  it's really to fight the American people wanting their country
[42:05.040 --> 42:08.600]  back and not wanting to turn their guns in.
[42:08.600 --> 42:11.280]  So I have to tell you that when I come back,
[42:11.280 --> 42:12.680]  I'm going to speak directly to Trump.
[42:12.680 --> 42:14.520]  And I'm going to get into specifics of this
[42:14.520 --> 42:16.640]  and run through it as quickly and as focused as I can.
[42:16.640 --> 42:24.360]  But it really is outrageous that this is total draconian
[42:24.360 --> 42:27.200]  authoritarianism, absolute surveillance of everything
[42:27.200 --> 42:28.720]  you do, listening to in your house,
[42:28.720 --> 42:32.720]  tracking you, selling the data, putting fake information
[42:32.720 --> 42:35.160]  on your computers, loading it with malware,
[42:35.160 --> 42:38.080]  buy big tech, doing whatever they want.
[42:38.080 --> 42:40.120]  And now so arrogant, they're going
[42:40.120 --> 42:42.920]  to meet with the FCC at a meeting we'll cover when we come back,
[42:42.920 --> 42:45.840]  openly on how to in free speeches we know it.
[42:45.840 --> 42:47.400]  Trump must take action.
[42:47.400 --> 42:51.520]  But regardless, we the people in the states must take action.
[42:51.520 --> 42:53.240]  This is the architecture of the internet
[42:53.240 --> 42:55.640]  was designed for total control.
[42:55.640 --> 42:58.960]  We must reverse that course.
[42:58.960 --> 43:02.160]  It's been a year since info wars and our other channels
[43:02.160 --> 43:04.120]  were completely banned off of YouTube.
[43:04.120 --> 43:06.360]  We had over 5 billion views when we got banned.
[43:06.360 --> 43:09.040]  And we're credited with getting Donald Trump elected
[43:09.040 --> 43:12.040]  because we were able to punch through and reach the grassroots.
[43:12.040 --> 43:14.200]  Now as we enter the 2020 election cycle,
[43:14.200 --> 43:16.840]  it's more important than ever that there be a place where
[43:16.840 --> 43:19.960]  the censors are unable to block the signal.
[43:19.960 --> 43:22.760]  And it's now here, banned.video.
[43:22.760 --> 43:26.520]  Banned.video is the answer for libertarians, conservatives,
[43:26.520 --> 43:30.680]  nationalists, pro-gun, pro-life, pro-human individuals
[43:30.680 --> 43:35.400]  to have their own platform where videos banned by YouTube,
[43:35.400 --> 43:37.360]  Facebook, and Twitter are still available.
[43:37.360 --> 43:40.080]  Watch your favorite content for media personalities banned
[43:40.080 --> 43:42.360]  by big tech, works on every device,

[43:47.840 --> 43:50.320]  and join in on the conversation from anywhere
[43:50.320 --> 43:51.720]  with banned.video.

[43:53.600 --> 43:55.760]  Twitter, SMS, email, and more.
[43:55.760 --> 43:58.280]  Banned.video.

[44:58.920 --> 45:02.200]  Supermail Vitality is already in the top three
[45:02.200 --> 45:05.080]  of our best sellers for the six years we've had it.
[45:05.080 --> 45:09.080]  It is a award-winning formula produced in Utah
[45:09.080 --> 45:11.560]  by one of the top herbal companies in the nation
[45:11.560 --> 45:13.240]  that we've been private labeling.
[45:13.240 --> 45:14.520]  It is cold-pressed.
[45:14.520 --> 45:17.800]  It takes at least three times the herbs that
[45:17.800 --> 45:21.000]  are wild-crafted and organic to be able to produce this.
[45:21.000 --> 45:22.160]  It's not boiled.
[45:22.160 --> 45:22.960]  It's not heated.
[45:22.960 --> 45:24.120]  It's never been dried.
[45:24.120 --> 45:26.640]  It's taken from fresh herbs.
[45:26.640 --> 45:29.320]  That's why it's so strong.
[45:29.320 --> 45:33.040]  That's why it's so effective for libido, stamina, and energy.
[45:33.040 --> 45:36.280]  And I'm so excited about Supermail Vitality
[45:36.280 --> 45:39.480]  and Carnivore 30 that I'm offering you

[46:04.320 --> 46:06.160]  super-silver wound shell.

[46:08.000 --> 46:09.720]  It is the best you can get.
[46:09.720 --> 46:12.840]  A 100% review rate on Power Reviews.
[46:12.840 --> 46:15.080]  Well, now we teamed up with them and came out
[46:15.080 --> 46:17.920]  with two different types of skin cream.
[46:17.920 --> 46:20.560]  One is naturally sent in with grapefruit essential oils.
[46:20.560 --> 46:22.240]  The other is unscented.
[46:22.240 --> 46:26.320]  It's got hyaluronic acid, vitamin E, essential oils
[46:26.320 --> 46:27.640]  from grapefruit.
[46:27.640 --> 46:30.480]  It's got coconut oil and so much more.
[46:30.480 --> 46:33.480]  And this patented, nano-type of silver
[46:33.480 --> 46:36.360]  that has been proven to be the most effective and the best.
[46:36.360 --> 46:39.400]  It's got all these other great vitamins and compounds
[46:39.400 --> 46:42.360]  that are known to be wonderful for your skin.
[46:42.360 --> 46:44.760]  If you're a woman, man, if you were a child,
[46:44.760 --> 46:48.280]  we are so excited about the new super-silver skin cream.
[46:48.280 --> 46:51.040]  We have it in the smaller tube and the large tube.
[46:51.040 --> 46:54.240]  It's very, very affordable, and it funds our operations.
[46:54.240 --> 46:57.680]  Check it out today and get yours at mfullwarslife.com.
[46:57.680 --> 47:01.280]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[47:19.280 --> 47:20.680]  And again, welcome back.
[47:20.680 --> 47:25.680]  I'm your host Alex Jones on this Tuesday, September 3, 2019.
[47:25.680 --> 47:28.880]  It's September 3, 2019 broadcast.
[47:28.880 --> 47:31.360]  Here's my message to President Trump and the people
[47:31.360 --> 47:34.240]  of America and the world.
[47:34.240 --> 47:36.800]  It's recognized that in the last decade,
[47:36.800 --> 47:38.520]  the decision was made to not oppose
[47:38.520 --> 47:40.400]  authoritarianism anymore.
[47:40.400 --> 47:42.000]  And the United States, particularly
[47:42.000 --> 47:45.320]  under Barack Obama's tutelage, funded the most radical elements
[47:45.320 --> 47:48.520]  of Islam, transferred basically all of our secrets,
[47:48.520 --> 47:52.520]  including the Office of Personnel Hack to China,
[47:52.520 --> 47:53.800]  our weapons systems, everything.
[47:53.800 --> 47:56.840]  Because it was supposed to be the Chinese new century
[47:56.840 --> 47:58.240]  as the Council on Foreign Relations.
[47:58.240 --> 48:00.400]  And others had said, good little globalists
[48:00.400 --> 48:02.680]  that had maneuvered America for 50 years
[48:02.680 --> 48:07.400]  towards imperial collapse, on which the ashes of which
[48:07.400 --> 48:08.880]  world government would be built,
[48:08.880 --> 48:10.800]  an anti-human technocracy.
[48:10.800 --> 48:13.120]  So addressing the president, Mr. President,
[48:13.120 --> 48:15.200]  if you're not being given these briefings about how
[48:15.200 --> 48:17.440]  the world really works, they're lying to you.
[48:17.440 --> 48:19.800]  But I know you're a man of the world,
[48:19.800 --> 48:22.280]  an old school man of the world.
[48:22.280 --> 48:23.400]  You understand these things.
[48:23.400 --> 48:27.040]  So one of three things is going on.
[48:27.040 --> 48:30.640]  You're either extremely evil and are here as a placeholder
[48:30.640 --> 48:33.360]  because they knew there'd be a rebellion if Hillary tried
[48:33.360 --> 48:36.280]  to do all this, and you're just acting
[48:36.280 --> 48:40.080]  like you're resisting this total takeover.
[48:40.080 --> 48:42.480]  I don't think that's the case because of the evidence.
[48:42.480 --> 48:44.800]  Trump's doing a lot of good stuff and they hate his guts
[48:44.800 --> 48:47.120]  and they're freaking out.
[48:47.120 --> 48:51.080]  Or you're completely ignorant about how the technocracy works,
[48:51.080 --> 48:53.240]  how the internet works, how telecommunications work,
[48:53.240 --> 48:55.960]  and what's been built and what's actually unfolding
[48:55.960 --> 48:58.400]  and what's been designed.
[48:58.400 --> 49:02.600]  Or you are trying to defeat the Chinese globalist up front,
[49:02.600 --> 49:06.480]  and then the funding will dry up to the entire architecture.
[49:06.480 --> 49:08.000]  And you believe that's the way to beat it,
[49:08.000 --> 49:13.480]  is keep the economy going, and defeat the chikoms.
[49:13.480 --> 49:17.200]  Which I think it's a mix of two and three.
[49:17.200 --> 49:18.520]  Trump knows the internet's important,
[49:18.520 --> 49:22.480]  but it takes real study of the Defense Department,
[49:22.480 --> 49:26.640]  of the CIA, of the tax-free foundations,
[49:26.640 --> 49:29.440]  and of these systems to know what they're doing.
[49:29.440 --> 49:30.600]  But once you know what they're doing,
[49:30.600 --> 49:35.880]  it is outrageously obvious.
[49:35.880 --> 49:39.480]  So here's the message to you, Mr. President.
[49:39.480 --> 49:41.480]  This is not an ultimatum that I'm not
[49:41.480 --> 49:46.000]  going to support you if you don't do the right thing.
[49:46.000 --> 49:48.840]  You are basically killing yourself politically and us
[49:48.840 --> 49:52.080]  along with you if you don't take action.
[49:52.080 --> 49:58.800]  Because the government, the rogue government,
[49:58.800 --> 50:02.160]  the Clinton and Obama embeds, as you call them,
[50:02.160 --> 50:05.240]  the technical name is a stay-behind network
[50:05.240 --> 50:06.320]  or the resistance.
[50:06.320 --> 50:07.960]  They call themselves the resistance.
[50:07.960 --> 50:08.880]  Like, you're Hitler.
[50:08.880 --> 50:10.160]  They're the French resistance.
[50:10.160 --> 50:12.240]  I call our movement against the globalist the resistance,
[50:12.240 --> 50:15.120]  because we're trying to get our country back.
[50:15.120 --> 50:17.200]  But they have to usurp the proper term from us,
[50:17.200 --> 50:18.840]  because they really are the establishment.
[50:18.840 --> 50:20.240]  Obviously, you're not the establishment.
[50:20.240 --> 50:22.640]  Like, 93% of news reports about you are negative.
[50:25.960 --> 50:28.920]  So we have this collection of globalists on foreign payroll.
[50:28.920 --> 50:31.400]  I'm going to show evidence of that in a moment, not just China,
[50:31.400 --> 50:36.280]  but 19 other countries involved in congressional hearings
[50:36.280 --> 50:38.520]  saying they're going to shut down the grassroots
[50:38.520 --> 50:40.560]  and the populist movement and the nationalist movement
[50:40.560 --> 50:43.400]  and the NRA and Matt Drudge and Alex Jones.
[50:43.400 --> 50:46.120]  We're all named.
[50:46.120 --> 50:47.920]  Then they go to other committees and lie and say
[50:47.920 --> 50:49.800]  there is no censorship.
[50:49.800 --> 50:53.320]  This is total information control.
[50:53.320 --> 50:56.600]  It's like the phone book telling 99% of people in the town
[50:56.600 --> 50:58.680]  they can't put an ad in it.
[50:58.680 --> 51:02.400]  Whether it's legal or not, no one would put up with that crap.
[51:02.400 --> 51:04.840]  But it's not legal, because they keep saying,
[51:04.840 --> 51:07.160]  oh, we don't want any government involvement in the internet.
[51:07.160 --> 51:09.360]  The government built the internet with corporations.
[51:09.360 --> 51:11.400]  DARPA did.
[51:11.400 --> 51:15.000]  And it's now been transferred to the UN via Obama.
[51:15.000 --> 51:17.960]  And you're sitting by, Mr. President,
[51:17.960 --> 51:22.440]  while Mitch McConnell's Twitter is shut down for no reason.
[51:22.440 --> 51:24.880]  And while you can't run campaign ads saying,
[51:24.880 --> 51:28.240]  join us at the Trump 2020 campaign website.
[51:28.240 --> 51:33.120]  If you're a strong woman, we want strong women.
[51:33.120 --> 51:34.400]  You quote Miss Gender.
[51:34.400 --> 51:36.640]  What does that even mean?
[51:36.640 --> 51:39.040]  They can call anything they want selectively bad
[51:39.040 --> 51:39.840]  to shut it down.
[51:39.840 --> 51:41.520]  That's what this is, authoritarianism.
[51:41.520 --> 51:43.440]  And you know that.
[51:43.440 --> 51:46.840]  So the fact that we're here, and this is going on, is a joke.
[51:46.840 --> 51:50.520]  Obama signed the Countering Foreign Disinformation and Propaganda
[51:50.520 --> 51:51.320]  Act.
[51:51.320 --> 51:55.240]  Billions of dollars went into it.
[51:55.240 --> 51:57.960]  Hundreds and hundreds of millions per project.
[51:57.960 --> 52:00.960]  We've been covering it since 2016,
[52:00.960 --> 52:05.160]  when Obama signed it in the Defense Authorization Act.
[52:05.160 --> 52:07.360]  A lot of the money ran out earlier this year.
[52:07.360 --> 52:10.440]  That's why he saw the big layoffs and leftist media.
[52:10.440 --> 52:12.600]  Well, they're just censorship wolf packs.
[52:12.600 --> 52:16.480]  And so I have to sit here and watch this going on,
[52:16.480 --> 52:19.080]  as one of the top Democrats in the FCC
[52:19.080 --> 52:22.680]  announces this symposium put on by the FCC to quote,
[52:22.680 --> 52:26.520]  get drudge and get the conservatives.
[52:26.520 --> 52:28.880]  Like Google executive said, their head
[52:28.880 --> 52:31.320]  operative over censorship said, to make sure
[52:31.320 --> 52:32.840]  Trump doesn't get re-elected.
[52:32.840 --> 52:38.560]  And we sit here while this goes on, and we have the CIA,
[52:38.560 --> 52:43.240]  and the FBI, and the NSA, and at least 15 other agencies,
[52:43.240 --> 52:46.000]  and the Atlantic Council running it.
[52:46.000 --> 52:48.000]  Just like Hillary had a second set of servers
[52:48.000 --> 52:51.040]  and a second set of emails, that you have a private group plugged
[52:51.040 --> 52:53.640]  in with national security clearances.
[52:53.640 --> 52:55.400]  That's why Clapper didn't want his taken.
[52:55.400 --> 52:58.280]  And then notice they didn't take it when you ordered it taken.
[52:58.280 --> 53:02.880]  The son of a bastard still has it,
[53:02.880 --> 53:05.040]  because that's how they're criminally running
[53:05.040 --> 53:06.440]  this whole damn thing.
[53:06.440 --> 53:08.680]  And we put on screen the articles,
[53:08.680 --> 53:12.160]  we show you the legislation, we show you the laws.
[53:12.160 --> 53:13.520]  Oh, the government's not supposed
[53:13.520 --> 53:16.760]  to get involved, the fake libertarian think tanks say,
[53:16.760 --> 53:18.400]  because some of their board members
[53:18.400 --> 53:20.560]  are on the Atlantic Council.
[53:20.560 --> 53:26.160]  How sick that a private group getting funded by 20 foreign
[53:26.160 --> 53:32.160]  countries has more power than the president or Congress,
[53:32.160 --> 53:34.160]  and they have such a great power.
[53:34.160 --> 53:37.200]  The president or Congress, and they have such disrespect
[53:37.200 --> 53:43.520]  for Mitch McConnell, and all these guys that can barely
[53:43.520 --> 53:46.320]  check their email, Mitch McConnell
[53:46.320 --> 53:48.560]  can barely wipe his ass, OK?
[53:48.560 --> 53:49.680]  I don't mean that mean.
[53:49.680 --> 53:53.480]  He's just an old, fuddy duddy.
[53:53.480 --> 53:54.880]  And they're all just rolling over.
[53:54.880 --> 53:55.480]  Well, guess what?
[53:55.480 --> 53:56.320]  I'm not rolling over.
[53:56.320 --> 53:59.080]  So listen, Trump, you can roll over all you want all day long.
[53:59.080 --> 54:00.880]  This is the easiest thing to fix in the world.
[54:00.880 --> 54:02.280]  You talk about election meddling.
[54:02.280 --> 54:04.240]  You talk about manipulation.
[54:04.240 --> 54:05.520]  You talk about discrimination.
[54:05.520 --> 54:06.760]  You talk about illegal spying.
[54:06.760 --> 54:09.600]  You talk about how the Comey and all them
[54:09.600 --> 54:13.920]  were illegally spying on you and leaking and lying about it.
[54:13.920 --> 54:17.240]  This is a private group, the Atlantic Council,
[54:17.240 --> 54:20.200]  in congressional hearings bragging
[54:20.200 --> 54:23.080]  how they're spying on everybody in everybody's email,
[54:23.080 --> 54:26.360]  in everybody's YouTube account, in everybody's Facebook,
[54:26.360 --> 54:28.280]  and they trained 100,000 people at the Southern
[54:28.280 --> 54:30.520]  Improvised Law Center over the last three years
[54:30.520 --> 54:32.960]  to then put them into every major corporation,
[54:32.960 --> 54:36.280]  including credit card companies, to oversee
[54:36.280 --> 54:39.040]  what you're buying and doing, literally putting
[54:39.040 --> 54:41.640]  commas are political officers in everywhere.
[54:41.640 --> 54:45.520]  Facebook's hired over 1,000 former members of the Stasi.
[54:45.520 --> 54:48.320]  Google's moving into the former Stasi headquarters
[54:48.320 --> 54:50.200]  in East Germany.
[54:50.200 --> 54:52.720]  They're arresting people by the thousands every week
[54:52.720 --> 54:55.960]  in Europe for their political speech.
[54:55.960 --> 55:01.440]  If you get arrested in Scotland for saying, Islam is questionable.
[55:01.440 --> 55:03.080]  This isn't tyranny.
[55:03.080 --> 55:07.520]  This is tyranny on steroids.
[55:07.520 --> 55:10.120]  To the articles on dredgerport.com where the Pentagon
[55:10.120 --> 55:14.440]  launches new program to fight viral internet content.
[55:14.440 --> 55:17.160]  They say polarizing viral content.
[55:17.160 --> 55:20.400]  Well, we need to polarize and say the right to keep bare arms
[55:20.400 --> 55:22.200]  is not negotiable.
[55:22.200 --> 55:28.000]  But notice it says polarizing, these new words, polarizing,
[55:28.000 --> 55:29.320]  not hate.
[55:29.320 --> 55:31.320]  See, once you get people agreeing to ban hate,
[55:31.320 --> 55:32.800]  well, that's the thing you define it as.
[55:32.800 --> 55:37.800]  Well, now it's polarizing and viral.
[55:37.800 --> 55:40.200]  This is how the big corporations, Hollywood falling apart,
[55:40.200 --> 55:42.200]  the media falling apart with no viewers, their answer
[55:42.200 --> 55:44.280]  is just sabotage everybody else doing it.
[55:44.280 --> 55:47.240]  And it says the Pentagon is going to be involved domestically.
[55:47.240 --> 55:54.320]  And Obama, by the way, legalized it.
[55:54.320 --> 55:56.640]  I'm going to show you where Obama got this legalized.
[55:56.640 --> 55:58.520]  Well, it needs to be made illegal.
[55:58.520 --> 56:01.440]  So see, Obama set up his own private government
[56:01.440 --> 56:04.040]  before he left, put the Atlantic Council in charge,
[56:04.040 --> 56:06.440]  gave them $2 billion.
[56:06.440 --> 56:08.920]  I mean, you think Bruce Orr, giving his wife a half million
[56:08.920 --> 56:12.280]  bucks to help cook up the dossiers big and the $37 million,
[56:12.280 --> 56:14.680]  they paid their friends and family to put the fake dossier.
[56:14.680 --> 56:16.040]  You think that $37 million is it?
[56:16.040 --> 56:18.680]  It's billions, baby.
[56:18.680 --> 56:20.840]  And they all get little secret agent cards.
[56:20.840 --> 56:23.280]  And they all get to get into your computer,
[56:23.280 --> 56:24.280]  get into your phone.
[56:24.280 --> 56:25.600]  They all have back doors.
[56:25.600 --> 56:28.400]  They're the super class.
[56:28.400 --> 56:30.320]  And now they're in the news telling you, yeah,
[56:30.320 --> 56:32.200]  we're listening to everything you do in watching you.
[56:32.200 --> 56:33.960]  So watch your mouth.
[56:33.960 --> 56:34.800]  The NSA did that.
[56:34.800 --> 56:35.800]  They'd be strung up.
[56:35.800 --> 56:38.640]  But when Google and Apple do it, well,
[56:38.640 --> 56:40.240]  we better kiss their butt or we'll
[56:40.240 --> 56:43.480]  be banned like Alex Jones.
[56:43.480 --> 56:45.280]  So when we come back, I'm going to read to you
[56:45.280 --> 56:48.920]  from the Atlantic Council, from congressional testimony,
[56:48.920 --> 56:52.640]  from their statements, how they're watching you,
[56:52.640 --> 56:55.720]  how they're listening to you, how they're controlling you,
[56:55.720 --> 56:58.320]  and how they're about to ban everything, including
[56:58.320 --> 57:01.040]  likes on YouTube and Facebook because they,
[57:01.040 --> 57:02.920]  at the Atlantic Council, don't want
[57:02.920 --> 57:05.240]  you to be able to say you like something
[57:05.240 --> 57:06.520]  because you like freedom.
[57:06.520 --> 57:07.560]  You like guns.
[57:07.560 --> 57:08.680]  You like America.
[57:08.680 --> 57:09.680]  You like Trump.
[57:09.680 --> 57:11.000]  You like Alex Jones.
[57:11.000 --> 57:12.320]  You like Matt Drudge.
[57:12.320 --> 57:13.440]  You like freedom.
[57:13.440 --> 57:15.520]  You like Tucker Carlson.
[57:15.520 --> 57:19.200]  They've got to not let you see that you're popular
[57:19.200 --> 57:21.400]  and that you're not alone.
[57:21.400 --> 57:23.960]  What a group of dirty crooks.
[57:23.960 --> 57:25.680]  There's another way to counter them as well.
[57:25.680 --> 57:27.960]  Financially support this transmission.

[57:50.160 --> 57:51.000]  I've been so busy.
[57:51.000 --> 57:53.480]  I haven't talked about it because I've been covering news,
[57:53.480 --> 57:54.720]  but it's very exciting.

[59:04.160 --> 59:07.520]  where videos banned by YouTube, Facebook, and Twitter
[59:07.520 --> 59:08.800]  are still available.
[59:08.800 --> 59:10.440]  We've launched it, ladies and gentlemen.

[59:17.760 --> 59:21.080]  or David Knight, or Owen Schreuer, or Paul Watson band videos.
[59:21.080 --> 59:24.320]  We are building it to be a place where banned memes
[59:24.320 --> 59:25.360]  are able to be posted.
[59:25.360 --> 59:28.680]  And where a growing list of freedom-loving contributors
[59:28.680 --> 59:32.000]  are able to have a home free from being shut down,
[59:32.000 --> 59:34.760]  free from being censored, free from being silenced
[59:34.760 --> 59:37.920]  by big tech, the chai-coms, the Hollywood scum,
[59:37.920 --> 59:38.880]  and the globlest.
[59:38.880 --> 59:41.120]  Freedom of speech has a home.

[01:00:18.600 --> 01:00:20.600]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're back live,
[01:00:20.600 --> 01:00:21.600]  broadcasting World Wine.
[01:00:21.600 --> 01:00:23.600]  I'm your host, Alex Jones, and I've
[01:00:23.600 --> 01:00:25.600]  got a message to America, a message to the world,
[01:00:25.600 --> 01:00:27.600]  a message to President Trump.
[01:00:27.600 --> 01:00:29.600]  The corporations and governments of the world
[01:00:29.600 --> 01:00:31.600]  have decided to go pure authoritarian
[01:00:31.600 --> 01:00:33.600]  to maintain their control.
[01:00:33.600 --> 01:00:36.600]  They've decided to end, basically, any way
[01:00:36.600 --> 01:00:39.600]  for individuals to communicate that's not censored,
[01:00:39.600 --> 01:00:42.600]  watched over, and controlled.
[01:00:42.600 --> 01:00:50.600]  And we now have the FCC and all the rest of them,
[01:00:50.600 --> 01:00:52.600]  when Trump came out and said, maybe I'll
[01:00:52.600 --> 01:00:56.600]  have the FCC make sure that big tech doesn't censor.
[01:00:56.600 --> 01:01:03.600]  So the FCC, and so the Federal Communications Commission came
[01:01:03.600 --> 01:01:06.600]  out, as well as the Federal Trade Commission,
[01:01:06.600 --> 01:01:08.600]  and a bunch of others, they're all pushing it.
[01:01:08.600 --> 01:01:13.600]  They're all doing it, and said, we
[01:01:13.600 --> 01:01:19.600]  are going to start censoring the internet.
[01:01:19.600 --> 01:01:22.600]  I know it's FCC, guys, I understand that.
[01:01:22.600 --> 01:01:26.600]  Do yourselves a favor, type in members of FCC
[01:01:26.600 --> 01:01:30.600]  Hall for censoring the internet.
[01:01:30.600 --> 01:01:31.600]  We'll do that.
[01:01:31.600 --> 01:01:33.600]  I'll rebroadcast and do that.
[01:01:33.600 --> 01:01:35.600]  Let me give you something to play here.
[01:01:35.600 --> 01:01:37.600]  This is a really important report right here.
[01:01:37.600 --> 01:01:40.600]  Let's go ahead and go to this report,
[01:01:40.600 --> 01:01:42.600]  because it needs to be seen.
[01:01:42.600 --> 01:01:44.600]  Absolutely critical.
[01:01:44.600 --> 01:01:46.600]  Where is the outrage over the opioid carnage?
[01:01:46.600 --> 01:01:48.600]  And I've got a big report on that, too.
[01:01:48.600 --> 01:01:50.600]  I'm glad I got reminded of that.
[01:01:50.600 --> 01:01:57.600]  We'll be right back after this. Stay with us.
[01:01:57.600 --> 01:01:59.600]  The gunman in West Texas shooting
[01:01:59.600 --> 01:02:01.600]  identified as Seth Ator.
[01:02:01.600 --> 01:02:04.600]  And this individual got pulled over by the police
[01:02:04.600 --> 01:02:07.600]  and then went crazy and began just
[01:02:07.600 --> 01:02:09.600]  indiscriminately shooting.
[01:02:09.600 --> 01:02:12.600]  That's normally what you see with a Mexican drug cartel.
[01:02:12.600 --> 01:02:14.600]  That's what they do when the cops pull them over.
[01:02:14.600 --> 01:02:16.600]  They start shooting at the cops, shooting everybody else.
[01:02:16.600 --> 01:02:18.600]  That's what they do when the cops come over.
[01:02:18.600 --> 01:02:20.600]  That's what they do when the cops come over.
[01:02:20.600 --> 01:02:22.600]  That's what they do when the cops come over.
[01:02:22.600 --> 01:02:24.600]  That's what they do when the cops come over.
[01:02:24.600 --> 01:02:26.600]  Two days after the bust,
[01:02:26.600 --> 01:02:28.600]  Nogales Police Chief Jeffrey Kirkham says
[01:02:28.600 --> 01:02:31.600]  his department received an ominous message
[01:02:31.600 --> 01:02:33.600]  through an informant in Mexico.
[01:02:33.600 --> 01:02:35.600]  That information was brought forward
[01:02:35.600 --> 01:02:38.600]  that the drug runners, through the cartels,
[01:02:38.600 --> 01:02:40.600]  that we were to look the other way
[01:02:40.600 --> 01:02:42.600]  when we're not working, when we're off duty,
[01:02:42.600 --> 01:02:44.600]  we're not in uniform, and that if we didn't,
[01:02:44.600 --> 01:02:46.600]  we were hiding in plain sight.
[01:02:48.600 --> 01:02:50.600]  Inside this closet,
[01:02:50.600 --> 01:02:53.600]  a shopping bag holds a quarter million dollars in cash.
[01:02:53.600 --> 01:02:56.600]  Also seized, six pounds of methamphetamine
[01:02:56.600 --> 01:02:59.600]  with a street value of another quarter million dollars.
[01:02:59.600 --> 01:03:02.600]  We have 12,000 people a year that die from guns
[01:03:02.600 --> 01:03:04.600]  in the United States.
[01:03:04.600 --> 01:03:07.600]  And what I do know is that
[01:03:07.600 --> 01:03:11.600]  around 9,000 of those are suicides.
[01:03:11.600 --> 01:03:14.600]  So we've got
[01:03:14.600 --> 01:03:16.600]  quite a few people that are being killed
[01:03:16.600 --> 01:03:18.600]  and are being killed by shootings,
[01:03:18.600 --> 01:03:21.600]  by murderers, but still statistically,
[01:03:21.600 --> 01:03:23.600]  ladies and gentlemen,
[01:03:23.600 --> 01:03:25.600]  tens of thousands drowned,
[01:03:25.600 --> 01:03:27.600]  tens of thousands fall and hit their head in the bathroom
[01:03:27.600 --> 01:03:29.600]  and die, and I pulled up the numbers here.
[01:03:29.600 --> 01:03:32.600]  They're always four or five years behind on statistics,
[01:03:32.600 --> 01:03:34.600]  but in 2016,
[01:03:34.600 --> 01:03:37.600]  50 plus thousand people died
[01:03:37.600 --> 01:03:40.600]  from prescription opioids.
[01:03:40.600 --> 01:03:43.600]  When opioid cells in Oklahoma began to skyrocket,
[01:03:43.600 --> 01:03:46.600]  the death toll from unintentional prescription,
[01:03:46.600 --> 01:03:49.600]  drug-related overdoses,
[01:03:49.600 --> 01:03:51.600]  mounted,
[01:03:51.600 --> 01:03:54.600]  leaving in its wake broken homes,
[01:03:54.600 --> 01:03:56.600]  families and communities.
[01:03:56.600 --> 01:03:58.600]  The state estimates the opioid epidemic
[01:03:58.600 --> 01:04:02.600]  has killed some 6,000 Oklahomans in 19 years.
[01:04:02.600 --> 01:04:05.600]  The former chairman and president of Purdue Pharma
[01:04:05.600 --> 01:04:07.600]  says under oath, he does not know
[01:04:07.600 --> 01:04:11.600]  how much the family has made off the sale of oxycontin.
[01:04:11.600 --> 01:04:14.600]  Purdue Pharma is best known as the developer of oxycontin.
[01:04:14.600 --> 01:04:17.600]  The company is facing billions of dollars
[01:04:17.600 --> 01:04:19.600]  in potential liability for its role
[01:04:19.600 --> 01:04:21.600]  in the nation's opioid crisis.
[01:04:21.600 --> 01:04:25.600]  Automobiles kill hundreds of thousands of people a year.
[01:04:25.600 --> 01:04:29.600]  But again, they hype up mass shootings
[01:04:29.600 --> 01:04:31.600]  because it is scary to think you can go to the movie theater
[01:04:31.600 --> 01:04:33.600]  or go to the shopping mall
[01:04:33.600 --> 01:04:35.600]  and then some crazy person comes in and kills you,
[01:04:35.600 --> 01:04:39.600]  but out of 300 and probably 60 million people
[01:04:39.600 --> 01:04:40.600]  if you count all the illegal aliens,
[01:04:40.600 --> 01:04:43.600]  but 330 million people in the census,
[01:04:43.600 --> 01:04:47.600]  it's very rare to get shot in a mass shooting.
[01:04:47.600 --> 01:04:50.600]  Just like it's rare to have somebody break in your house
[01:04:50.600 --> 01:04:52.600]  and shoot you, but it's still terrible that happens to you.
[01:04:52.600 --> 01:04:56.600]  But the point is the media is hyping this to launch Red Flag.
[01:04:56.600 --> 01:05:07.600]  Paul Joseph Watson with Summit.News and Action 7 News were here in Hong Kong.
[01:05:07.600 --> 01:05:09.600]  This is Greg Ries for Infowars.com in Hong Kong.
[01:05:09.600 --> 01:05:14.600]  Our recent trip to Hong Kong was a new achievement for Infowars.com.
[01:05:14.600 --> 01:05:18.600]  Despite being the most banned broadcast in the free world,
[01:05:18.600 --> 01:05:22.600]  we continue to win because of our great, strong, loyal audience.
[01:05:22.600 --> 01:05:25.600]  We have Dan Lyman covering Infowars Europe.
[01:05:25.600 --> 01:05:27.600]  Paul Joseph Watson in the UK.
[01:05:27.600 --> 01:05:31.600]  Millie Weaver and Caitlin Bennett in the American Heartland.
[01:05:31.600 --> 01:05:34.600]  And from Austin, Texas, a team of reporters and crew
[01:05:34.600 --> 01:05:38.600]  ready to be dispatched wherever the story is going down.
[01:05:38.600 --> 01:05:40.600]  We are not done winning.
[01:05:40.600 --> 01:05:42.600]  And with your support, we will keep winning.
[01:05:42.600 --> 01:05:45.600]  We have to keep winning. We have to win more.
[01:05:45.600 --> 01:05:47.600]  Go to InfowarsStore.com.
[01:05:47.600 --> 01:05:50.600]  You have gone to InfowarsStore.com
[01:05:50.600 --> 01:05:53.600]  and gotten books and films, supplements and t-shirts
[01:05:53.600 --> 01:05:56.600]  and water filtration, air filtration and things you need.
[01:06:12.600 --> 01:06:15.600]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen. I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[01:06:17.600 --> 01:06:20.600]  Almost every federal agency has been turned against the First Amendment.
[01:06:20.600 --> 01:06:24.600]  The government is running the takeover of the Internet,
[01:06:24.600 --> 01:06:26.600]  not just here, but all over the world.
[01:06:26.600 --> 01:06:28.600]  It's not big tech calling the shots.
[01:06:28.600 --> 01:06:29.600]  It's the Democrats.
[01:06:29.600 --> 01:06:33.600]  And I'm going to show you the proof at the FCC,
[01:06:33.600 --> 01:06:36.600]  as well as the FTC, the Federal Trade Commission,
[01:06:36.600 --> 01:06:41.600]  as well as the Federal Election Commission, the FEC.
[01:06:41.600 --> 01:06:43.600]  I'm going to show you all those articles.
[01:06:43.600 --> 01:06:45.600]  You're a TV viewer here in a moment.
[01:06:45.600 --> 01:06:47.600]  But first, here's the big issue.
[01:06:47.600 --> 01:06:50.600]  Trump was never in government, which is a plus.
[01:06:50.600 --> 01:06:53.600]  But it's also a minus because he knows censorship is going on.
[01:06:53.600 --> 01:06:56.600]  He's been shown that Google and Apple and Facebook
[01:06:56.600 --> 01:06:59.600]  are lying to Congress and lying to him, and he's mad about it.
[01:06:59.600 --> 01:07:02.600]  And he said he's going to take major action.
[01:07:05.600 --> 01:07:10.600]  But that's not what's happening, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:07:10.600 --> 01:07:12.600]  So here's some of the headlines.
[01:07:12.600 --> 01:07:16.600]  U.S. unleashes military to fight fake news disinformation.
[01:07:16.600 --> 01:07:21.600]  And it goes on to say, viral memes, anything that shows discord,
[01:07:21.600 --> 01:07:23.600]  anything that gets people upset.
[01:07:23.600 --> 01:07:27.600]  We're supposed to be upset about 60 million abortions
[01:07:27.600 --> 01:07:30.600]  it's almost up to now, and now keeping babies alive after they're born.
[01:07:30.600 --> 01:07:33.600]  We're supposed to get upset about the homeless problem.
[01:07:33.600 --> 01:07:37.600]  We're supposed to get upset about obesity and diabetes and breast cancer.
[01:07:37.600 --> 01:07:41.600]  You're supposed to get upset about when your kids are doing bad in school.
[01:07:41.600 --> 01:07:44.600]  But imagine saying, you're not allowed to do that.
[01:07:44.600 --> 01:07:47.600]  I'm going to read you congressional testimony.
[01:07:47.600 --> 01:07:50.600]  What the FCC is being told, what the FEC is being told,
[01:07:50.600 --> 01:07:53.600]  what all these groups are saying.
[01:07:53.600 --> 01:07:58.600]  U.S. unleashes military to fight fake news disinformation.
[01:07:58.600 --> 01:08:01.600]  That's Yahoo News, Bloomberg.
[01:08:03.600 --> 01:08:07.600]  And they go on to say that Mitch McConnell hasn't supported it
[01:08:07.600 --> 01:08:10.600]  because he's Moscow Mitch.
[01:08:10.600 --> 01:08:14.600]  Moscow doesn't have 1% influence over this country.
[01:08:14.600 --> 01:08:17.600]  Everybody knows it. The Chai comms.
[01:08:17.600 --> 01:08:21.600]  But again, even Mitch McConnell is called a Russian agent.
[01:08:21.600 --> 01:08:25.600]  In the biggest story this weekend they pushed.
[01:08:25.600 --> 01:08:27.600]  Continuing this story on DrudgeReport.com.
[01:08:27.600 --> 01:08:31.600]  Pentagon launches new program to fight viral internet content.
[01:08:31.600 --> 01:08:36.600]  Anything that is influential, that the establishment doesn't control.
[01:08:36.600 --> 01:08:39.600]  They're afraid of your influence.
[01:08:39.600 --> 01:08:42.600]  All these old globalists thought you'd always love mainstream TV,
[01:08:42.600 --> 01:08:44.600]  mainstream newspapers. You don't. You don't trust them.
[01:08:44.600 --> 01:08:47.600]  So now they're just saying, we'll get rid of everybody else.
[01:08:47.600 --> 01:08:54.600]  Because Google and Facebook, 70% of people only get their news there.
[01:08:54.600 --> 01:09:00.600]  Continuing. Liberal FEC chairwoman targets online news she considers fraudulent.
[01:09:00.600 --> 01:09:02.600]  Federal election commission.
[01:09:02.600 --> 01:09:05.600]  Same thing the FCC was talking about a few years ago.
[01:09:05.600 --> 01:09:10.600]  Restricting talk radio making views on pro-life guns.
[01:09:10.600 --> 01:09:13.600]  You name it. Because well, that's political. We control that.
[01:09:13.600 --> 01:09:17.600]  No, it's the First Amendment.
[01:09:17.600 --> 01:09:22.600]  And it goes on to say that they want to stop the Russian efforts in 2020.
[01:09:22.600 --> 01:09:26.600]  You mean the populist effort to make America great again.
[01:09:26.600 --> 01:09:30.600]  Here's another one from WorldNet Daily reporting on public affairs.
[01:09:30.600 --> 01:09:32.600]  The Washington Post article.
[01:09:32.600 --> 01:09:35.600]  Obama used illegal propaganda on Americans.
[01:09:35.600 --> 01:09:40.600]  So they legalized it. That's the headline. Anybody can type it in.
[01:09:40.600 --> 01:09:45.600]  Obama legalizes using propaganda on Americans inside the U.S.
[01:09:45.600 --> 01:09:47.600]  That was six years ago.
[01:09:47.600 --> 01:09:50.600]  And that's what this is now.
[01:09:50.600 --> 01:09:55.600]  GOP freezes Twitter spending after McConnell account locked.
[01:09:55.600 --> 01:09:56.600]  There it is.
[01:09:56.600 --> 01:09:59.600]  NDA legalizes use of propaganda on U.S. public.
[01:09:59.600 --> 01:10:01.600]  Business Insider. This is what they're doing.
[01:10:01.600 --> 01:10:04.600]  Tulsi Gabbard sues Google over post-debate suspension.
[01:10:04.600 --> 01:10:08.600]  When she searched the number one, they just suspended her.
[01:10:08.600 --> 01:10:11.600]  Not because she's a terrorist.
[01:10:11.600 --> 01:10:13.600]  Not because she's a Nazi.
[01:10:13.600 --> 01:10:15.600]  But again, even if you're a Nazi, you shouldn't have your speech taken
[01:10:15.600 --> 01:10:17.600]  because then anybody can be called a Nazi.
[01:10:17.600 --> 01:10:20.600]  No, because she won the debate. And you can't have that.
[01:10:20.600 --> 01:10:23.600]  Google promises to stop lying because of Drudge Report spotlight.
[01:10:23.600 --> 01:10:26.600]  Remember 2013?
[01:10:26.600 --> 01:10:29.600]  They had a Pentagon meeting. Government promises.
[01:10:29.600 --> 01:10:31.600]  Everybody in slip and said, Google, same thing.
[01:10:31.600 --> 01:10:34.600]  They stopped lying because of Drudge Report spotlight.
[01:10:34.600 --> 01:10:36.600]  Facebook censorship alternative media.
[01:10:36.600 --> 01:10:39.600]  Just the beginning warrants top neocon insider.
[01:10:39.600 --> 01:10:46.600]  Info wars ran the story from Grey Zone project over a year ago.
[01:10:46.600 --> 01:10:47.600]  And there it all is.
[01:10:47.600 --> 01:10:50.600]  He said, oh, by next year, we're going to censor all conservatives,
[01:10:50.600 --> 01:10:52.600]  all nationalists, everybody.
[01:10:52.600 --> 01:10:57.600]  You can watch the video where he says he's going to censor everybody
[01:10:57.600 --> 01:10:59.600]  and that the neocons are in control of the Democrats.
[01:10:59.600 --> 01:11:01.600]  And you saw this last week.
[01:11:01.600 --> 01:11:03.600]  YouTube acts as anti-protest.
[01:11:03.600 --> 01:11:07.600]  YouTube acts as anti-protest channels as U.S. military,
[01:11:07.600 --> 01:11:10.600]  U.S. Ministry of Truth battles China over Hong Kong.
[01:11:10.600 --> 01:11:14.600]  Now, I support Hong Kong independence.
[01:11:14.600 --> 01:11:17.600]  But the Pentagon supports it too.
[01:11:17.600 --> 01:11:23.600]  And so they went to YouTube and said, don't let the channels
[01:11:23.600 --> 01:11:28.600]  that are against independence operate, delete them.
[01:11:28.600 --> 01:11:31.600]  Again, proving right there, Mr. President,
[01:11:31.600 --> 01:11:33.600]  the government's in control of this.
[01:11:33.600 --> 01:11:36.600]  And Hillary supports independence in Hong Kong.
[01:11:36.600 --> 01:11:40.600]  Because it gives her more power or whatever, not for the people.
[01:11:40.600 --> 01:11:42.600]  But I support it because it's the right thing to do.
[01:11:42.600 --> 01:11:44.600]  Just because Hillary and I agree every once in a while,
[01:11:44.600 --> 01:11:46.600]  that means she's a good person.
[01:11:46.600 --> 01:11:49.600]  But again, this is illustrative of how they censor whatever they want,
[01:11:49.600 --> 01:11:50.600]  whatever they want.
[01:11:50.600 --> 01:11:52.600]  So it was decided in government.
[01:11:52.600 --> 01:11:55.600]  By these councils, by these groups that I be censored,
[01:11:55.600 --> 01:11:57.600]  I'm going to show you the proof.
[01:11:57.600 --> 01:12:00.600]  Hell, all the congressional testimony, everybody's seen it.
[01:12:00.600 --> 01:12:04.600]  I'm going to show you more in a moment.
[01:12:04.600 --> 01:12:05.600]  Here it is.
[01:12:05.600 --> 01:12:08.600]  Obama quietly signs the counter-disinformation propaganda act in the law.
[01:12:08.600 --> 01:12:12.600]  This is what leaves all these Democrats and all these neocons
[01:12:12.600 --> 01:12:16.600]  with government positions and government paychecks
[01:12:16.600 --> 01:12:19.600]  and national security clearances to do this
[01:12:19.600 --> 01:12:24.600]  in the defense spending to stop Trump.
[01:12:24.600 --> 01:12:26.600]  Isn't that incredible?
[01:12:26.600 --> 01:12:30.600]  U.S. unleashes military to fight fake news, disinformation, Bloomberg.
[01:12:30.600 --> 01:12:31.600]  You read the quotes.
[01:12:31.600 --> 01:12:35.600]  It says anything viral?
[01:12:35.600 --> 01:12:37.600]  Anything they don't like.
[01:12:37.600 --> 01:12:39.600]  Anything the establishment doesn't like.
[01:12:39.600 --> 01:12:41.600]  And here's some of the other articles.
[01:12:41.600 --> 01:12:42.600]  Drudge.
[01:12:42.600 --> 01:12:44.600]  Fox News could be censored under new federal rules.
[01:12:44.600 --> 01:12:46.600]  Experts warns.
[01:12:46.600 --> 01:12:48.600]  FCC.
[01:12:48.600 --> 01:12:51.600]  Federal Communications Commission.
[01:12:51.600 --> 01:12:53.600]  It's all these agencies.
[01:12:53.600 --> 01:12:58.600]  I'm at FTC earlier, and I was, again, mixing it in with talking to someone from the FCC.
[01:12:58.600 --> 01:13:01.600]  Don't want to mix those two, but they're all following the same policy
[01:13:01.600 --> 01:13:06.600]  because the globalists are in control of that whole operation.
[01:13:06.600 --> 01:13:09.600]  Now, let me move to the big enchilada.
[01:13:09.600 --> 01:13:13.600]  I can read you the countless info wars.com articles with links and quotes.
[01:13:13.600 --> 01:13:19.600]  I can read you the endless zero hedge articles a year before Matt Taibbi wrote about it
[01:13:19.600 --> 01:13:22.600]  in three articles for Rolling Stone.
[01:13:22.600 --> 01:13:26.600]  We reported it in 2016 and 17.
[01:13:26.600 --> 01:13:36.600]  He reported it in 2018, August 13, 2018, and August 2, 2018,
[01:13:36.600 --> 01:13:39.600]  right when I was being completely banned.
[01:13:39.600 --> 01:13:41.600]  Document cam shot please.
[01:13:41.600 --> 01:13:46.600]  The censorship does not end well.
[01:13:46.600 --> 01:13:51.600]  And he goes on to quote with links how the CIA and Homeland Security,
[01:13:51.600 --> 01:13:57.600]  through the think tank, the Atlantic Council, and I had a Freudian failure brain fart.
[01:13:57.600 --> 01:13:59.600]  I said 20 countries.
[01:13:59.600 --> 01:14:01.600]  I'm sorry.
[01:14:01.600 --> 01:14:03.600]  It's more than 20 countries.
[01:14:03.600 --> 01:14:09.600]  So two weeks ago, we learned about a new campaign against inauthentic content conducted by Facebook
[01:14:09.600 --> 01:14:13.600]  in consultation with Congress and the secretive think tank Atlantic Council,
[01:14:13.600 --> 01:14:18.600]  whose board includes an array of ex CIA and Homeland Security officials who still have security clearances
[01:14:18.600 --> 01:14:22.600]  in the name of cracking down on alleged Russian disinformation.
[01:14:22.600 --> 01:14:25.600]  That's their cover for cracking down the American people.
[01:14:25.600 --> 01:14:29.600]  As part of the bizarre alliance of Internet news distributors and quasi government censors,
[01:14:29.600 --> 01:14:38.600]  the social network zapped 32 accounts and pages including an ad for no unite right anti fascist counter rally.
[01:14:38.600 --> 01:14:44.600]  It goes on that they banned the Ron Paul Institute and anti war.com.
[01:14:44.600 --> 01:14:48.600]  And Scott Horton, who is a smart guy, but very mild.
[01:14:48.600 --> 01:14:56.600]  Both the Jones situation in Facebook Atlantic Council deletions seem an effort to fulfill a request made last year
[01:14:56.600 --> 01:14:58.600]  by Senator sherry committee.
[01:14:58.600 --> 01:15:03.600]  Last October, Facebook, Google and Twitter were asked by Hawaii Senator Maisie.
[01:15:03.600 --> 01:15:12.600]  Is ono to draw up a mission statement to prevent the foment of discord in the official Senate proposal.
[01:15:12.600 --> 01:15:14.600]  Prevent the foment of discord.
[01:15:14.600 --> 01:15:19.600]  The Democrats are saying, if you see him getting gas or in a mall or restaurant, you get in their face.
[01:15:19.600 --> 01:15:24.600]  Or CNN praise when Congressman Scalise got shot and said the guy wasn't a monster that did it.
[01:15:24.600 --> 01:15:30.600]  And I mean, I played clips last week where they said flatten them, burn them down, destroy them, mainline host.
[01:15:30.600 --> 01:15:35.600]  But they're saying if we foment saying this is dangerous, let's do something.
[01:15:35.600 --> 01:15:42.600]  Oh, we need to be shut down by the CIA and a private consortium with Defense Department money.
[01:15:42.600 --> 01:15:45.600]  Trump, this is the Achilles heel.
[01:15:45.600 --> 01:15:47.600]  This is the jugular.
[01:15:47.600 --> 01:15:48.600]  This is everything.
[01:15:48.600 --> 01:15:50.600]  What they're doing is beyond Russia gate.
[01:15:50.600 --> 01:15:55.600]  This is criminal and you're sitting there letting them do it.
[01:15:55.600 --> 01:16:01.600]  Finally, there's a way for you to get into the blockchain, the hottest financial sector without all the speculation.
[01:16:01.600 --> 01:16:06.600]  No, enjoy a 27% annualized payment each month without the ups and downs of Bitcoin.
[01:16:06.600 --> 01:16:14.600]  CNN programs broadcast on Fox Business News, blockchain data centers offer an equipment leasing program in the explosive digital asset marketplace.
[01:16:14.600 --> 01:16:22.600]  Inspired by entrepreneurs who sold picks and shovels during the gold rush, the money is in the mining equipment used to manufacture dozens of critical digital assets.
[01:16:22.600 --> 01:16:33.600]  On a security IPO or note, blockchain data centers have a proven turnkey equipment sale leaseback program with a 27% annualized lease payment deposited into your bank account each month.
[01:16:33.600 --> 01:16:34.600]  Don't miss this one.

[01:20:20.600 --> 01:20:26.600]  On the September 3rd, 2019, Tuesday broadcast, I have an emergency message to President Trump and the people of the world.
[01:20:26.600 --> 01:20:32.600]  The Democrats now admit what the defense budget of 2017 stated.
[01:20:32.600 --> 01:20:37.600]  Obama put $2 billion in that we know of, there's obviously more,
[01:20:37.600 --> 01:20:43.600]  to put Democrats and key never-Trumpers in positions of power in U.S. intelligence agencies
[01:20:43.600 --> 01:20:49.600]  and in think tanks like the Atlantic Council to run a giant disinformation operation
[01:20:49.600 --> 01:20:52.600]  against the populist awakening and against the American people.
[01:20:52.600 --> 01:20:57.600]  And now they admit they plan to steal the election from President Trump in 2020
[01:20:57.600 --> 01:21:03.600]  and they're running leftist intelligence operatives as Republicans and as Democrats everywhere
[01:21:03.600 --> 01:21:09.600]  to sabotage this and bring in gun complication as well.
[01:21:09.600 --> 01:21:17.600]  This is totally illegal, it's beyond authoritarian, it's what happens in third world regimes and it's here.
[01:21:17.600 --> 01:21:25.600]  And even Rolling Stone and others are reporting it all that the Atlantic Council and the CIA is running it
[01:21:25.600 --> 01:21:29.600]  and they're going to get rid of all human communication on the Internet that isn't synthetic.
[01:21:29.600 --> 01:21:34.600]  You won't be able to like YouTube's, you won't be able to like Facebook's, it's being announced.
[01:21:34.600 --> 01:21:39.600]  Everything will be filtered, everything will be controlled because the establishment thought,
[01:21:39.600 --> 01:21:43.600]  oh we don't care about websites and people, they'll always believe the New York Times and CNN.
[01:21:43.600 --> 01:21:48.600]  But because no one believes them anymore in their fake polls, they have panicked
[01:21:48.600 --> 01:21:52.600]  and have decided to overturn the entire apple cart.
[01:21:52.600 --> 01:21:56.600]  And if we allow this to happen, if we let them bring in Chinese Communist all censorship,
[01:21:56.600 --> 01:21:58.600]  it'll be a new dark age in this nation.
[01:21:58.600 --> 01:22:02.600]  They're arresting people all over Europe for criticizing Islam
[01:22:02.600 --> 01:22:06.600]  or parents that don't want their children to be indoctrinated into homosexuality.
[01:22:06.600 --> 01:22:08.600]  It's so dangerous.
[01:22:08.600 --> 01:22:11.600]  The establishment has decided to go with pure authoritarianism.
[01:22:11.600 --> 01:22:17.600]  And they say in the Senate report, anyone that tries to foment discord,
[01:22:17.600 --> 01:22:24.600]  they said these groups must prevent the foment of discord and it's being announced by Bloomberg.
[01:22:24.600 --> 01:22:31.600]  U.S. unleashes military to fight fake news, disinformation, quote, anything that's viral.
[01:22:31.600 --> 01:22:38.600]  So now populist, loyal Americans are Russian agents and they're using intelligence agencies against us
[01:22:38.600 --> 01:22:43.600]  and Obama before he left office legalized domestic propaganda and domestic spying
[01:22:43.600 --> 01:22:47.600]  as if we're a foreign power by listing us all as Russians.
[01:22:47.600 --> 01:22:53.600]  While they're the globalists in the payroll of the Chai comms opposing our president trying to restore our republic.
[01:22:53.600 --> 01:22:57.600]  Here's a compilation of the last week and then some older clips showing you it's ongoing
[01:22:57.600 --> 01:23:01.600]  of Democrats saying we're going to kill Trump. We're going to assault his supporters.
[01:23:01.600 --> 01:23:06.600]  We're going to level them. We're going to burn them down trying to get their minions to attack us.
[01:23:06.600 --> 01:23:11.600]  And then when we say that's wrong, we should take our government back peacefully and restore the republic.
[01:23:11.600 --> 01:23:14.600]  They call that fomenting and censor us.
[01:23:14.600 --> 01:23:17.600]  Even the Senate majority leaders have been censored.
[01:23:17.600 --> 01:23:22.600]  Trump ads that say we want strong women have been censored on Facebook and they're standing by it
[01:23:22.600 --> 01:23:26.600]  because they don't respect the president because they believe he doesn't understand what Obama did.
[01:23:26.600 --> 01:23:30.600]  What Obama did or doesn't have the will to change it.
[01:23:30.600 --> 01:23:34.600]  This is beyond Russiagate. This is beyond spying illegally on Trump.
[01:23:34.600 --> 01:23:40.600]  This is them using agencies on the American people in the free press like China.
[01:23:40.600 --> 01:23:42.600]  Here's this latest breakdown.
[01:23:42.600 --> 01:23:47.600]  It's not only that Trump has to lose but that all his enablers have to lose.
[01:23:47.600 --> 01:23:51.600]  We have to collectively in essence burn down the republican party.
[01:23:51.600 --> 01:23:59.600]  That sentiment at the core of the coalition cannot be pride loose and it cannot be negotiated with and it cannot be appeased.
[01:23:59.600 --> 01:24:00.600]  We have to level them.
[01:24:00.600 --> 01:24:05.600]  Utterly confronted and destroyed. That is the only way to break the coalition apart.
[01:24:05.600 --> 01:24:11.600]  Because if there are survivors, if there are people who weather this storm, they will do it again.
[01:24:11.600 --> 01:24:14.600]  You have to go out and beat these folks if they don't agree with you.
[01:24:14.600 --> 01:24:18.600]  What we've got to do is fight in Congress, fight in the courts, fight in the streets.
[01:24:18.600 --> 01:24:30.600]  And if you see anybody from that cabinet in a restaurant, in a department store, in a gasoline station, you get out and you create a crowd.
[01:24:30.600 --> 01:24:37.600]  And you push back on them and you tell them they're not welcome anymore, anywhere.
[01:24:37.600 --> 01:24:40.600]  What we should be doing is shunning these people.
[01:24:40.600 --> 01:24:47.600]  Shunning, shaming these people is a statement of moral indignation that these people are not fit for polite society.
[01:24:47.600 --> 01:24:49.600]  They have shamed themselves too much.
[01:24:49.600 --> 01:24:51.600]  The heart of the thing must be ripped out.
[01:24:51.600 --> 01:24:53.600]  The darkness must be banished.
[01:24:53.600 --> 01:25:00.600]  The people who feel moral revulsion at that display we saw last night must collectively mobilize in greater numbers than the chanters.
[01:25:00.600 --> 01:25:05.600]  Up and down the ticket, federal, state, local offices, the country has to repudiate this.
[01:25:05.600 --> 01:25:08.600]  Press always asks me, don't I wish I were debating him?
[01:25:08.600 --> 01:25:11.600]  No, I wish you were in high school, I could take him behind the gym.
[01:25:11.600 --> 01:25:13.600]  That's what I wish.
[01:25:13.600 --> 01:25:20.600]  If we were in high school, I'd take him behind the gym and beat the hell out of him.
[01:25:20.600 --> 01:25:22.600]  Let me give you one bottom line.
[01:25:22.600 --> 01:25:25.600]  As a former government official, government's going to kill this guy.
[01:25:25.600 --> 01:25:27.600]  That's so entertaining.
[01:25:27.600 --> 01:25:29.600]  These are some sick people.
[01:25:29.600 --> 01:25:34.600]  And then now they have the clip last week that he's, Trump's killed more people than Hitler and Stalin.
[01:25:34.600 --> 01:25:36.600]  They're trying to invoke a civil war.
[01:25:36.600 --> 01:25:38.600]  They want our guns.
[01:25:38.600 --> 01:25:40.600]  And now Biden has come out.
[01:25:40.600 --> 01:25:47.600]  Now, O'Rourke has come out and said, we'll play this next segment, that they're going to get our guns, all semi-autos.
[01:25:47.600 --> 01:25:49.600]  And they're not going to stop there, they never do.
[01:25:49.600 --> 01:25:52.600]  They want complete power over everybody.
[01:25:52.600 --> 01:25:59.600]  So I just showed you, and we could play all the congressional hearings where they say, I want Alex Jones shut down.
[01:25:59.600 --> 01:26:06.600]  The FEC, the FCC, all saying they want Matt Drudge shut down.
[01:26:06.600 --> 01:26:13.600]  All he does is link to them. Sometimes the majority of the traffic many weeks the New York Times get is from Drudge.
[01:26:13.600 --> 01:26:15.600]  They don't care. They don't like him existing.
[01:26:15.600 --> 01:26:18.600]  They want the power. They want the control.
[01:26:18.600 --> 01:26:21.600]  They want to be able to shovel whatever lies they want at you.
[01:26:21.600 --> 01:26:27.600]  And right now, Google and Facebook alone, 70% of people only get their news from them.
[01:26:27.600 --> 01:26:29.600]  Look that number up.
[01:26:29.600 --> 01:26:32.600]  They want 100%, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:26:32.600 --> 01:26:38.600]  Here's the good news. America and the world is shoveled awake now that no one believes anything mainstream news says.
[01:26:38.600 --> 01:26:42.600]  Even though most of it's true, there was a shark attack here, a car crashed there.
[01:26:42.600 --> 01:26:44.600]  This was the temperature today.
[01:26:44.600 --> 01:26:47.600]  Where the lies are is political areas.
[01:26:47.600 --> 01:26:53.600]  That's where, where you see some press conference where a 15-year-old guy's like, my mom didn't believe in vaccines, but I did.
[01:26:53.600 --> 01:26:54.600]  And they're great.
[01:26:54.600 --> 01:26:56.600]  Turns out that guy worked for a PR firm.
[01:26:56.600 --> 01:26:57.600]  Of course he did.
[01:26:57.600 --> 01:27:02.600]  Just like the girls saying she was there and saw the babies thrown out of the incubators in Iraq in 1990.
[01:27:02.600 --> 01:27:03.600]  None of it was true.
[01:27:03.600 --> 01:27:05.600]  You know phony stuff when you see it.
[01:27:05.600 --> 01:27:08.600]  Remember Hillary Clinton had that town hall and I said, that was fake?
[01:27:08.600 --> 01:27:09.600]  The media attacked me.
[01:27:09.600 --> 01:27:13.600]  Months later, turned out it was all fake, all hired actors.
[01:27:13.600 --> 01:27:16.600]  I know 70 millimeter digital.
[01:27:16.600 --> 01:27:19.600]  Basically, it looked like 70 millimeter.
[01:27:19.600 --> 01:27:23.600]  I know actors when I see them. You know actors when you see them.
[01:27:23.600 --> 01:27:26.600]  And they're so pissed that we see through them, aren't they?
[01:27:26.600 --> 01:27:30.600]  They're so angry that we don't buy their bull anymore.
[01:27:30.600 --> 01:27:32.600]  So there's my message to the president.
[01:27:32.600 --> 01:27:34.600]  The story is top-linked or was top-linked.
[01:27:34.600 --> 01:27:36.600]  Just move down to the middle on dredgerport.com.
[01:27:36.600 --> 01:27:44.600]  And as soon as this live shows over today, I'll repost in there the first hour or so of the show where I lay all this out.
[01:27:44.600 --> 01:27:46.600]  Because it's there.
[01:27:46.600 --> 01:27:47.600]  And it's the truth.
[01:27:47.600 --> 01:27:50.600]  And if Trump doesn't do anything, you know, let me do this.
[01:27:50.600 --> 01:27:58.600]  I have a lot of the news coming up on the gun grabbing and with China and with some incredible fentanyl news that I guarantee you haven't heard this information.
[01:27:58.600 --> 01:27:59.600]  It's totally true.
[01:27:59.600 --> 01:28:00.600]  And it's insane.
[01:28:00.600 --> 01:28:03.600]  The only thing I've ever think I've seen that's coming up to this hour.
[01:28:03.600 --> 01:28:05.600]  But what do you think Trump should do?
[01:28:05.600 --> 01:28:06.600]  What are you going to do?
[01:28:06.600 --> 01:28:17.600]  How angry are you about Google and all them moving to China and now trying to set that up here and then lying to Congress and then spying on everything you do?
[01:28:17.600 --> 01:28:21.600]  And it's all over the news. They're listening to you and watching you in your house.
[01:28:21.600 --> 01:28:25.600]  Why are they putting that on the front of the Washington Post and Yahoo?
[01:28:25.600 --> 01:28:28.600]  Because they're just going ubiquitous.
[01:28:28.600 --> 01:28:31.600]  It's now here.
[01:28:31.600 --> 01:28:32.600]  These people are sick.
[01:28:32.600 --> 01:28:34.600]  And then there's something special in the third hour.
[01:28:34.600 --> 01:28:37.600]  I'm not at liberty to tell you yet, but I'm going to get to it in the third hour.
[01:28:37.600 --> 01:28:38.600]  Something special.
[01:28:38.600 --> 01:28:45.600]  And then we're also going to have Paul Joseph Watson, always informative, always hard hitting,
[01:28:45.600 --> 01:28:47.600]  hosting the fourth hour today.
[01:28:47.600 --> 01:28:49.600]  And then the War Room with Owen Schroyer after that.
[01:28:49.600 --> 01:28:51.600]  Whatever you do, share the link.
[01:28:51.600 --> 01:28:52.600]  NewsWars.com.

[01:32:02.600 --> 01:32:10.600]  It is an award-winning formula produced in Utah by one of the top herbal companies in the nation that we've been private labeling.

[01:32:18.600 --> 01:32:24.600]  It's not boiled. It's not heated. It's never been dried. It's taken from fresh herbs.

[01:33:21.600 --> 01:33:28.600]  Trust me, honey, everything's gonna be all right.
[01:33:28.600 --> 01:33:42.600]  Just do like I do. There ain't nothing to it. Listen to me, baby, and if I can't do it, all you gotta do is just let yourself go.
[01:33:42.600 --> 01:33:50.600]  All right, we have... It's gotta be 15, 20 stacks of news here.
[01:33:50.600 --> 01:34:05.600]  Each one more important than the next. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22 stacks of news.
[01:34:05.600 --> 01:34:10.600]  22 stacks of news. Some of these stacks have five articles. Some of them have like 20 articles.
[01:34:10.600 --> 01:34:13.600]  And they're all incredibly illustrative of everything I've told you.
[01:34:13.600 --> 01:34:21.600]  Human Animal Clones, every major device watching, listening to you, fed into AI, setting up a post-human world,
[01:34:21.600 --> 01:34:26.600]  tracking you as its enemy, figuring out how to destroy you and your family, just all of it admitted.
[01:34:26.600 --> 01:34:32.600]  Mainstream news saying it will kill you. You're obsolete. Roll over in the ditch and die.
[01:34:32.600 --> 01:34:37.600]  Imagine if spaceships flew up and we're broadcasting that, you'd freak out, you'd say,
[01:34:37.600 --> 01:34:41.600]  I'm gonna resist. We'll fight the last person. But none of you just hear it forever.
[01:34:41.600 --> 01:34:45.600]  Humans are bad. Humans suck. Okay, we keep babies alive after they're born.
[01:34:45.600 --> 01:34:52.600]  We keep them comfortable. Get the goody-goods. They're just easing a sin to the trance.
[01:34:52.600 --> 01:35:00.600]  The trance, ladies and gentlemen, so that we just sink into that hot water, slit our wrists,
[01:35:00.600 --> 01:35:07.600]  you know, you slit your wrist and water that's like 98.9. You don't even feel it really. You just die.
[01:35:07.600 --> 01:35:14.600]  They've just got us like the frog in the pot and they're slitting our wrists lovingly, liberally.
[01:35:14.600 --> 01:35:22.600]  How about some 5G? How about some more MSG? How about some Aspartame? How about some Glyphosate?
[01:35:22.600 --> 01:35:30.600]  How about some GMO? How about some screen time? How about some Prozac? How about some Ritalin?
[01:35:30.600 --> 01:35:41.600]  How about some weaponized marijuana? How about 25,000 tons of fentanyl?
[01:35:41.600 --> 01:35:48.600]  We did the math enough to kill 10 billion people if they took a enough dose to kill you.
[01:35:48.600 --> 01:35:54.600]  Caught being shipped to the U.S. by China. The opium war is in reverse.
[01:35:54.600 --> 01:35:59.600]  Hitting their enemy with everything they've got. That's coming up next hour.
[01:35:59.600 --> 01:36:08.600]  But I specifically just spent half of the transmission with the message that the Democratic Party,
[01:36:08.600 --> 01:36:14.600]  along with some neocon-never-trumpers, are in control of a government stay-behind group
[01:36:14.600 --> 01:36:21.600]  that they now are openly announcing in Bloomberg and AP that Trump's a Russian agent
[01:36:21.600 --> 01:36:28.600]  and Mitch McConnell's Moscow Mitch, those are quotes, and that they're not going to let them win again.
[01:36:28.600 --> 01:36:32.600]  Totally discredited, a total lie. They're the foreign power.
[01:36:32.600 --> 01:36:37.600]  And then it admits in the article that the Atlantic Council, with all these people's security clearances,
[01:36:37.600 --> 01:36:44.600]  is funded by at least 20 foreign governments, including the Chinese Communist.
[01:36:44.600 --> 01:36:52.600]  Let me say that again. Qatar and Saudi Arabia and China fund the Atlantic Council
[01:36:52.600 --> 01:36:59.600]  with national security clearances interface with $2 billion to steal the election in 2020
[01:36:59.600 --> 01:37:06.600]  and Rolling Stones reporting on it. And nobody cares.
[01:37:06.600 --> 01:37:11.600]  And then people that bleed red, white, and blue, we're the traders.
[01:37:11.600 --> 01:37:16.600]  Oh, sure we are. Right, right.
[01:37:16.600 --> 01:37:20.600]  And the Federal Elections Commission and the Federal Communications Commission
[01:37:20.600 --> 01:37:31.600]  have the Democrat board members having all these events, calling for shutting up and quote, getting that drudge.
[01:37:31.600 --> 01:37:39.600]  Think about that. So I thought I would specifically open the phones up on two big issues.
[01:37:39.600 --> 01:37:44.600]  The Democrats open announcement that they're going to get your guns and they're coming for them,
[01:37:44.600 --> 01:37:50.600]  all semi-autos to start with and register all the others, you know, where that leads.
[01:37:50.600 --> 01:37:56.600]  Beto Erore can't get that sickening rat-like smile off a psychotic face.
[01:37:56.600 --> 01:38:01.600]  Stumbling Joe Biden, what do you think about that? And how do we take action to educate people about it?
[01:38:01.600 --> 01:38:07.600]  It's super rare to die on a mass shooting. And that all the studies show that they are up since the 1990s
[01:38:07.600 --> 01:38:10.600]  because the media hypes them a direct correlation to major studies.
[01:38:10.600 --> 01:38:15.600]  So how do we get the message across its MSM's fault overall?
[01:38:15.600 --> 01:38:23.600]  And that almost all these individuals are on psychotropic drugs, which on the insert says can cause mass murder.
[01:38:23.600 --> 01:38:29.600]  How do we get Trump and the Yenon Ray on the offense and set up on the defense?
[01:38:29.600 --> 01:38:34.600]  That's one question. And then number two, what do you think about Senate hearings?
[01:38:34.600 --> 01:38:39.600]  I just read your testimony. Even out of Rolling Stone has the quotes.
[01:38:39.600 --> 01:38:50.600]  Anyone that, what's the exact quote, foments discord or makes people uncomfortable.
[01:38:50.600 --> 01:38:55.600]  Think about that. Tai Ebi, censorship is on end well. And I'm only reading that because it's a year and a half after we reported on it.
[01:38:55.600 --> 01:39:11.600]  He reported on it. And it's right there for you that the Chinese fund the CIA and Saudi Arabia to shut us up.
[01:39:11.600 --> 01:39:16.600]  Do we have any instincts? Do we have any tribalism? Do we have any nationalism?
[01:39:16.600 --> 01:39:21.600]  Are we territorial? Because I'm going to tell you how this world works.
[01:39:21.600 --> 01:39:26.600]  I'm not taking anything from anybody. But let me tell you, you try to take something from me.
[01:39:26.600 --> 01:39:35.600]  I'm going to come after you. You can have anything you want, but you better not take it from me.
[01:39:35.600 --> 01:39:40.600]  And they teach us to all roll over and they teach us all to lay down.
[01:39:40.600 --> 01:39:46.600]  And I'll say, I go out in public, I look at the public, they're soft. And I'm soft compared to what people used to be like.
[01:39:46.600 --> 01:39:52.600]  But I look at the helplessness of this nation and what we've turned into after 70 years glued to the television set.
[01:39:52.600 --> 01:40:02.600]  And I ask myself, how do we get out of this? First, it's a spiritual decision to be motivated and to care about something and be purpose driven.
[01:40:02.600 --> 01:40:12.600]  All the numbers, all the studies show it. People that only care about themselves are incredibly unhappy people.
[01:40:12.600 --> 01:40:21.600]  But if you care about something bigger, you're electrified. The problem is the globalists care about evil, their mission driven to dominate and take over.
[01:40:21.600 --> 01:40:26.600]  Those of us that aren't evil are driven just to be left alone, have our own lives. We can't do that.
[01:40:26.600 --> 01:40:36.600]  We have to get into the positions of power to decentralize the power and cut off these globalist tentacles.
[01:40:36.600 --> 01:40:52.600]  So I want to give the number out 877-789-ALIX, 877-789-2539, 877-789-2539, 877-ALIX on those issues.
[01:40:52.600 --> 01:41:00.600]  How do we get Trump and Congress to act? The whole architecture of the Internet is spying and listening to you and watching you.
[01:41:00.600 --> 01:41:12.600]  It's the NSA gone public, getting you to opt in. It's not like we throw a fishing line out with a topwater bait and you reel it over and a bass comes up and hits it.
[01:41:12.600 --> 01:41:22.600]  It's more like a fish trap where the opening is bigger on the outside but then gets smaller by the time the fish goes in.
[01:41:22.600 --> 01:41:29.600]  It's scared to go back out because it saw how little the hole was once it and see it never leaves and you scoop it up.
[01:41:29.600 --> 01:41:39.600]  And so it's kind of like roach motels. Roaches go in, they don't go out. That's a nice bait. It smells kind of good. You go in, your legs get stuck to it.
[01:41:39.600 --> 01:41:45.600]  Roach's a roach to it. It runs straight forward. It doesn't back up. Ever seen a roach run backwards? No, it always runs forward or sideways.
[01:41:45.600 --> 01:41:56.600]  Forward locomotion. So he goes in, his feet stinging, he goes, ah! And then you run forward, ah! And now you're completely, oh! See how that works?
[01:41:56.600 --> 01:41:59.600]  But you're not a roach. You're a human. You can figure out what they're doing.
[01:41:59.600 --> 01:42:03.600]  Instead of just, well, we better kiss Google's ass and they'll let us do what we want once we do.
[01:42:03.600 --> 01:42:11.600]  You know, then they start tightening the noose around your neck. We're going to go to break, come back, place some of these clips, they're coming after your guns.
[01:42:11.600 --> 01:42:19.600]  It's, oh, remember when that was a conspiracy theory? It's always been their goal. And they say, if there's one more shooting, we got to take all the guns.
[01:42:19.600 --> 01:42:24.600]  Well, there's always going to be one more shooting. Even once they take all the guns, Sweden has total gunman.
[01:42:24.600 --> 01:42:28.600]  They have hand grenade, machine gun deaths almost every day because the Muslims are shipping them in.
[01:42:28.600 --> 01:42:35.600]  You want to live like they do in Chicago, Southside? No, I don't want to live like that.
[01:42:35.600 --> 01:42:41.600]  So get on the offense, point out the drugs they're doing, the culture's doing, and almost all these people are devil worshipers.
[01:42:41.600 --> 01:42:48.600]  This guy in, looks like in Odessa, wasn't he? He just threw a big fit. He even called the police before he did it.
[01:42:48.600 --> 01:42:53.600]  It's evil. It's selfishness. Well, they're right back, ladies and gentlemen, stay with us.
[01:42:53.600 --> 01:42:59.600]  In InfoWars Live, we always try to bring you game-changing products.
[01:42:59.600 --> 01:43:02.600]  Now, we've already been promoting and selling Super Silver Woundshell.
[01:43:02.600 --> 01:43:06.600]  For over a year, it's a best-seller. It is the best you can get.
[01:43:06.600 --> 01:43:09.600]  A 100% review rate on power reviews.
[01:43:09.600 --> 01:43:14.600]  Well, now we teamed up with them and came out with two different types of skin cream.
[01:43:14.600 --> 01:43:18.600]  One is naturally sent in with grapefruit essential oils. The other is unscented.
[01:43:18.600 --> 01:43:23.600]  It's got hyaluronic acid, vitamin E, essential oils from grapefruit.
[01:43:23.600 --> 01:43:26.600]  It's got coconut oil and so much more.
[01:43:26.600 --> 01:43:32.600]  And this patented, nano-type of silver that has been proven to be the most effective and the best.
[01:43:32.600 --> 01:43:38.600]  It's got all these other great vitamins and compounds that are known to be wonderful for your skin.
[01:43:38.600 --> 01:43:44.600]  If you're a woman, man, if you're a child, we are so excited about the new Super Silver Skin Cream.
[01:43:44.600 --> 01:43:50.600]  We have it in the smaller tube and the large tube. It's very, very affordable and it funds our operations.
[01:43:50.600 --> 01:44:15.600]  Check it out today and get yours at inforwarslife.com.
[01:44:20.600 --> 01:44:27.600]  Banned.video isn't just going to be a home for Alex Jones or David Knight or Owen Schreuer or Paul Watson band videos.
[01:44:27.600 --> 01:44:31.600]  We are building it to be a place where banned memes are able to be posted.
[01:44:31.600 --> 01:44:38.600]  And where a growing list of freedom-loving contributors are able to have a home free from being shut down,
[01:44:38.600 --> 01:44:45.600]  free from being censored, free from being silenced by big tech, the chai comms, the Hollywood scum and the globalists.
[01:44:45.600 --> 01:44:49.600]  Freedom of speech has a home. It's called Banned.video.
[01:44:49.600 --> 01:44:56.600]  America and the World is fighting back against tyranny at banned.video.
[01:44:56.600 --> 01:45:02.600]  It's been a year since inforwars and our other channels were completely banned off of YouTube.
[01:45:02.600 --> 01:45:07.600]  We had over 5 billion views when we got banned and we're credited with getting Donald Trump elected
[01:45:07.600 --> 01:45:10.600]  because we were able to punch through and reach the grassroots.
[01:45:10.600 --> 01:45:18.600]  Now as we enter the 2020 election cycle, it's more important than ever that there be a place where the censors are unable to block the signal
[01:45:18.600 --> 01:45:27.600]  and it's now here. Banned.video. Banned.video is the answer for libertarians, conservatives, nationalists, pro-gun, pro-life,
[01:45:27.600 --> 01:45:35.600]  pro-human individuals to have their own platform where videos banned by YouTube, Facebook and Twitter are still available.

[01:46:20.600 --> 01:46:31.600]  We have Dan Lyman covering Infowars Europe, Paul Joseph Watson in the UK, Millie Weaver and Caitlin Bennett in the American Heartland
[01:46:31.600 --> 01:46:38.600]  and from Austin, Texas a team of reporters and crew ready to be dispatched wherever the story is going down.
[01:46:38.600 --> 01:46:42.600]  We are not done winning and with your support we will keep winning.
[01:46:42.600 --> 01:46:45.600]  We have to keep winning. We have to win more.
[01:46:45.600 --> 01:46:56.600]  To InfowarsStore.com you have gone to InfowarsStore.com and gotten books and films, supplements, t-shirts and water filtration, air filtration and things you need.
[01:47:15.600 --> 01:47:44.600]  And we are back. Thanks for joining us here on The Provoked Transmission.
[01:47:45.600 --> 01:47:59.600]  Let me just remind listeners that we've got four days left if you want to get a free bottle of carnivore enzyme in the 90 count that you get free with a bottle of DNA Force Plus.
[01:47:59.600 --> 01:48:08.600]  It's the nicest, best enzyme that you're going to find. You guys get your mic open.
[01:48:08.600 --> 01:48:19.600]  Sorry, I just got to open my mic. Sorry. We'll start over here in just a minute.
[01:48:19.600 --> 01:48:41.600]  Okay, so a continuing, ladies and gentlemen. Carnivore is a digestive enzyme and carnivore is something that goes like a horse and carriage with other probiotics.
[01:48:41.600 --> 01:48:52.600]  But most people think of a probiotic as just good bacteria like you would find in a regular probiotic.
[01:48:52.600 --> 01:49:03.600]  But there are key enzymes that help break down protein and fat and that help you absorb it and get the benefits of it, but also help break it down in your stomach and in your intestines.
[01:49:03.600 --> 01:49:18.600]  And the 90 count carnivore cost us $17.87. Why then am I giving you a free bottle of that when it sells well?
[01:49:18.600 --> 01:49:24.600]  It's because I want people that haven't experienced it to see how amazing it is along with the probiotic.
[01:49:24.600 --> 01:49:36.600]  And if you take it with Myco ZX, that's the third leg of the stool, pun intended, I guess, because there's the candida, the yeast, the mold, especially if you've taken antibiotics.
[01:49:36.600 --> 01:49:45.600]  It knocks out all the good bacteria and then the yeast, the mold sets up colonies inside of you and that just causes massive, massive problems.
[01:49:45.600 --> 01:49:57.600]  And so with a good probiotic like fluorolifefrommphilwarstore.com and Myco ZX, that is also a big seller, if you take it with a carnivore, it will just do amazing things.
[01:49:57.600 --> 01:50:09.600]  And so you get a free bottle of it with DNA Force Plus. Again, that's DNA Force Plus, which has the PQQ, the CoQ10, it's our flagship product.
[01:50:09.600 --> 01:50:19.600]  They sell similar formulas to this for $300 in health clinics. And that's because most of those places mark things up five to seven times.
[01:50:19.600 --> 01:50:26.600]  Back before I even did a bigger order of this, it was costing us up to $50 a bottle for what we were putting in DNA Force Plus.
[01:50:26.600 --> 01:50:32.600]  I signed a multi-year contract, ordered twice as much of it, and I'm getting it for $30 something a bottle.
[01:50:32.600 --> 01:50:47.600]  Now, nobody puts that much product into something, whether it's carnivore, whether it's DNA Force. We'll get DNA Force Plus 98% reviews with a free bottle of carnivore for $74.95.
[01:50:47.600 --> 01:51:04.600]  And that $30 something bucks we make absolutely funds this operation. So you owe it to yourself. Also, supermail vitality is powerful cold-pressed herbs, libido stamina energy. Get a free bottle, a 30 count of carnivore, absolutely free when you get that for 25% off the supermail vitality.
[01:51:04.600 --> 01:51:17.600]  And that is, again, how you fund this operation. That is how we get around the global is trying to shut us down. So it's not just beyond critical. It's totally and completely essential.
[01:51:17.600 --> 01:51:26.600]  So I want to thank you all for your support. Now, we've got great colloidal silver. We've got the great super silver wound gel that's got 100% reviews.
[01:51:26.600 --> 01:51:40.600]  And it's even FDA approved for over the counter, but we private label it from the top firm in the US. The only private label are authorized. We've now worked with them and come out with a skin cream that's got the hyaluronic acid.
[01:51:40.600 --> 01:51:52.600]  And it's got the vitamin A and the vitamin D and all this other stuff. And for $7 a small tube, $14 for a big tube, it's 25% off right now.
[01:51:52.600 --> 01:52:03.600]  And again, that's the silver wound gel you're looking at. That is the silver cream that you're looking at. That is the same silver, the highest quality that's putting this nano sol form.
[01:52:03.600 --> 01:52:14.600]  So it works much better, but it's not approved as an over the counter drug. They didn't go through all those trials with the cream. And so it doesn't have all the added cost to it for us.
[01:52:14.600 --> 01:52:25.600]  We can get a little tube of it for $4 and sell it to you for $7. We can get a big tube of it for $9 and sell it to you for $14 or whatever. We buy enough, even cheaper.
[01:52:25.600 --> 01:52:35.600]  So that's how we fund our operations. And if you want to continue to hear this early warning system, this Paul Revere system exposed to the globalist, that's how we're doing it.
[01:52:35.600 --> 01:52:45.600]  Thanks to you. And without you, we won't be able to do it. So whatever you do, whether it's high quality coffee or fluoride free toothpaste, or whether it's fish oil and krill oil, everybody knows is so greater.
[01:52:45.600 --> 01:52:58.600]  The highest quality turmeric, ours has a 95% tested curcuminoid. We know of no other lab in the United States. We went to the top lab said, what's your top thing? They said 85% curcuminoid. Everybody else is three to 5%.
[01:52:58.600 --> 01:53:06.600]  They said, well, we want the highest. And they said, okay, we'll go 95%. We think it's the highest ever made. So that's why people love it so much.
[01:53:06.600 --> 01:53:16.600]  So bodies, ultimate turmeric formula in full or stored.com or 888-253-3139. Okay, I'm done plugging for the hour. Didn't really plug last hours. I did an extra big plug there.
[01:53:16.600 --> 01:53:22.600]  Please support our local AM and FM affiliates and spread the word as well. Again, because it's beyond critical.
[01:53:22.600 --> 01:53:30.600]  So they're coming for our guns. They've had cover stories in the New York Times saying we're going to take the firearms. We're going to repeal the Second Amendment.
[01:53:30.600 --> 01:53:39.600]  That's the goal. Register the guns and then confiscate all the guns down to single shots, just like South Side Chicago. That's the plan to dominate and control us.
[01:53:39.600 --> 01:53:44.600]  There's nothing to do with human life. It's all about a monopoly of power, as the UN has said.
[01:53:44.600 --> 01:53:53.600]  Trump, who was saying maybe he's for background checks, expanded background checks, which we already have, and red flag laws that violate the process.
[01:53:53.600 --> 01:54:02.600]  He had the fear God put into him by his constituents and by you and the common sense that, hey, these wouldn't have stopped these guys.
[01:54:02.600 --> 01:54:10.600]  They all said they were going to kill people and nothing was done as usual. So what's going on there? So there you have it.
[01:54:10.600 --> 01:54:17.600]  I mean, the Democrats are all over the news saying kill Trump, kill his supporters, burn down their houses, level them, and they're not having their guns taken.
[01:54:17.600 --> 01:54:24.600]  I mean, I think if somebody says we're going to kill you, you should get a terrorist threat charge. But that's not happening.
[01:54:24.600 --> 01:54:30.600]  It's the Democrats that are hyping this. I just played a clip earlier. So here is Trump finally getting it right.
[01:54:30.600 --> 01:54:35.600]  Stronger background checks would not stop attacks. So good for Trump. Here it is.
[01:54:35.600 --> 01:54:44.600]  Well, I've been speaking to him. I've been speaking to a lot of senators. We've been speaking to a lot of House members, a lot of Republicans, a lot of Democrats and people want to do something.
[01:54:44.600 --> 01:54:53.600]  So we're going to see this really hasn't changed anything. We're doing a package and we'll see what it all, how it comes about.
[01:54:53.600 --> 01:55:01.600]  It's coming about right now and a lot of people are talking about it. And that's irrespective of what happened yesterday in Texas.
[01:55:01.600 --> 01:55:08.600]  We're looking at a lot of different things. We're looking at a lot of different bills, ideas, concepts.
[01:55:08.600 --> 01:55:20.600]  It's been going on for a long while. Background checks. I will say that for the most part, sadly, if you look at the last four or five going back even five or six or seven years,
[01:55:20.600 --> 01:55:27.600]  for the most part, as strong as you make your background checks, they would not have stopped any of it.
[01:55:27.600 --> 01:55:34.600]  So it's a big problem. It's a mental problem. It's a big problem.
[01:55:34.600 --> 01:55:42.600]  Now, there's been a bunch of statements by Beto O'Rourke when he's not smirking and giggling like Eddie Haskell.
[01:55:42.600 --> 01:55:49.600]  And he's up there. We can't allow this to happen one more time. It's so simple. Let's just take all the AK-47s, which these aren't AK-47s.
[01:55:49.600 --> 01:55:58.600]  That's a full-auto Russian variant. These are semi-auto. So let's take all the AR-15s. Well, when he says that, he means all semi-auto down to your hunting rifle,
[01:55:58.600 --> 01:56:05.600]  which they've done everywhere else in the world. They have a way they do this, a formula. So that's why we can't quote compromise, because it isn't a compromise.
[01:56:05.600 --> 01:56:09.600]  They want our guns. Beto wants your guns. Here he is.
[01:56:09.600 --> 01:56:19.600]  How do you address the fears that the government is going to take away this assault right to which we call them?
[01:56:19.600 --> 01:56:31.600]  So I want to be really clear that that's exactly what we're going to do. Americans who own AR-15s, AK-47s, will have to sell them to the government.
[01:56:31.600 --> 01:56:43.600]  We're not going to allow them to stay on our streets, to show up in our communities, to be used against us in our synagogues, our churches, our mosques, our wallmarts, our public places.
[01:56:43.600 --> 01:56:49.600]  Oh, our mosque, like in the Middle East, where guns are all outlawed, but the citizens all have them and kill each other with them all day.
[01:56:49.600 --> 01:56:58.600]  It rates way above ours. Unbelievable. When we come back, Jay Johnson, formerly of Homeland Security, he says he thinks they're going to get the guns this time.
[01:56:58.600 --> 01:57:04.600]  So in case you didn't hear the New York Times, the Washington Post, they've all run headlines, time to repeal the Second Amendment.
[01:57:04.600 --> 01:57:10.600]  They always like, we can't allow one more. And then when there's another one, they go, see, we told you.
[01:57:10.600 --> 01:57:21.600]  A maximum of 150-something people die a year in these mass shootings. It's still too many, but again, thousands die from baseball bats, tens of thousands from cars.
[01:57:21.600 --> 01:57:25.600]  Everybody knows this. Why? Because they're planning a takeover.
[01:57:25.600 --> 01:57:30.600]  The Democrats have told you. They're going to crush Republicans. They're going to crush conservatives. They're going to put you in FEMA camps.
[01:57:30.600 --> 01:57:38.600]  They're going to take your children that they've said they're going to make you pay, but they don't want to face armed citizens. Anti-Food don't.
[01:57:38.600 --> 01:57:45.600]  So they want your guns first. Never turn your guns in. Get more guns and train to protect yourself.
[01:57:45.600 --> 01:57:59.600]  Supermail vitality is already in the top three of our best sellers for the six years we've had it. It is an award-winning formula produced in Utah by one of the top herbal companies in the nation that we've been private labeling.
[01:57:59.600 --> 01:58:10.600]  It is cold-pressed. It takes at least three times the herbs that are wild-crafted and organic to be able to produce this. It's not boiled. It's not heated. It's never been dried.
[01:58:10.600 --> 01:58:19.600]  It's taken from fresh herbs. That's why it's so strong. That's why it's so effective for libido, stamina, and energy.
[01:58:19.600 --> 01:58:33.600]  And I'm so excited about supermail vitality and Carnivore 30 that I'm offering you with every order of supermail vitality at 25% off a free bottle of Carnivore digestive enzyme.
[01:58:33.600 --> 01:58:40.600]  We're going to sell out of this very quickly, but it's an offer so that you experience how amazing both these products are.
[01:58:40.600 --> 01:58:45.600]  Secure yours at InfoWarsStore.com today or InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:58:45.600 --> 01:58:48.600]  Josh in Washington, you're on the air. Go ahead.
[01:58:48.600 --> 01:58:58.600]  Alex, God bless you. I have an idea for a new InfoWars t-shirt instead of this is your brain. This is your brain on drugs. This is your brain. This is your brain on 5G.
[01:58:58.600 --> 01:59:03.600]  Showing your brain, getting fried. Then I have some comments on your supplements, man. Totally changed my life.
[01:59:03.600 --> 01:59:09.600]  I use TurboForce bodies, Albu power, BrainForce, Fish Oil, Ultra12, Daily, X2 every several days.
[01:59:09.600 --> 01:59:17.600]  Now, what I've found is really combining them is sort of synergistic and transcendent feeling that I get by combining all your products.
[01:59:17.600 --> 01:59:21.600]  And I just want to urge all your listeners who haven't tried them, I just want to say why not.
[01:59:21.600 --> 01:59:31.600]  It's right that all of these things are known to be incredible, whether it's turmeric, or whether it's the fish oil or the krill oil, or whether it's the DNA force with the CoQ10 and BioPQQ and all the rest of it.
[01:59:31.600 --> 01:59:38.600]  All of these are things that are like rocket fuel on the body. You take these bases together, then you have your foundation, now you can build the big strong temple.
[01:59:38.600 --> 01:59:45.600]  With these products I take, when I religiously remember to take them, it makes my life so much better and then it funds the Information War, which is so critical.
[01:59:45.600 --> 01:59:47.600]  Thank you so much. God bless you.
[01:59:47.600 --> 01:59:52.600]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[02:00:18.600 --> 02:00:33.600]  We should probably pull up that clip, even aired in a couple of years, where Joe Biden and all these Democrats, when they were running for president back in 2008, they say,
[02:00:33.600 --> 02:00:48.600]  No one wants your guns. No one wants your guns. And they say it's totally made up. No one's taking your semi-automatic rifle, your shotgun, your handgun. It's all Republican lies.
[02:00:48.600 --> 02:00:54.600]  And then of course, for their internal handgun control incorporated and Bloomberg group, it's all, we're going to take all guns, all guns.
[02:00:54.600 --> 02:01:02.600]  They even want to ban hunting, where you can't even have it at a hunting lodge with a hunting master and it's all locked up on the range.
[02:01:02.600 --> 02:01:11.600]  They follow a formula. And here's the former head of Homeland Security, G. Johnson, saying he think it might be different this time. Here it is.
[02:01:11.600 --> 02:01:20.600]  To politics, Congress is coming back. The gun issue. J. Johnson, you've dealt with the gun issue in different ways as Department of Homeland Security.
[02:01:20.600 --> 02:01:24.600]  You know the politics of this town.
[02:01:24.600 --> 02:01:33.600]  51 people died in the month of August on the very last day of the month. We get that reminder in case anybody was letting opasso and date and fade.
[02:01:33.600 --> 02:01:47.600]  Chuck, to me, it feels like this time it might be different. I feel that my sense is that public opinion and congressional opinion are moving in the direction of doing some things consistent with the Second Amendment.
[02:01:47.600 --> 02:01:54.600]  This is a uniquely American problem and it requires a national solution. No, it's not.
[02:01:54.600 --> 02:02:04.600]  And particularly, now that we're back in an election cycle, Republicans, it seems to me, are going to want to be able to be in a position to say they have done something on this.
[02:02:04.600 --> 02:02:12.600]  And the timing of this latest tragedy, just as Congress is coming back into town, suggests also there'll be a certain amount of momentum this time.
[02:02:12.600 --> 02:02:17.600]  And so my hope is that we'll finally, finally get something done on this issue.
[02:02:17.600 --> 02:02:22.600]  We have massive mental illness taking place. We're becoming a demonic nation.
[02:02:22.600 --> 02:02:31.600]  We kill babies after they're born. And they all sit up there with hushed voices like they care so much in their little NPR trained voices.
[02:02:31.600 --> 02:02:44.600]  Don't whisper, oh, 54 people this month dead, shot by firearms. 54 people out of 350, 60 million of the county, legal aliens.
[02:02:44.600 --> 02:02:50.600]  Hundreds of thousands dead in Mexico. Thousands died in the last month in Mexico.
[02:02:50.600 --> 02:02:57.600]  It's worse than it's ever been. Thousands are being machined down to death by drug cartels and the public's all disarmed.
[02:02:57.600 --> 02:03:06.600]  Thousands, look it up, versus 54. But J. Johnson thinks you're a moron because the media knows how to hype something up.
[02:03:06.600 --> 02:03:15.600]  If this table was the deaths in America in the last month, then a third of the table's cancer, or the third of the table is heart attacks.
[02:03:15.600 --> 02:03:26.600]  And then Parkinson's and car wrecks and drowning and lightning strikes and being beat over the head and stabbed and then over on the corner of the table.
[02:03:26.600 --> 02:03:34.600]  54 in a month. Little corner of the table. But they focus in with an electron microscope.
[02:03:34.600 --> 02:03:41.600]  You ever seen an electron microscope like a scan of say copper or a scan? It looks like mountains. It's like, what? Is that a whole world?
[02:03:41.600 --> 02:03:48.600]  No, you're looking at a micron of a micron. And yeah, if you got shot dead at that moment, it's terrible.
[02:03:48.600 --> 02:03:53.600]  It's kind of like, if you're out of work, it's a depression. If your neighbor's out of work, it's a recession.
[02:03:53.600 --> 02:03:57.600]  I'm not wishing this on anybody, but it's like shark attacks.
[02:03:57.600 --> 02:04:03.600]  I was reading where Cape Cod had almost no one in the water this year because a couple of shark attacks.
[02:04:03.600 --> 02:04:16.600]  I guarantee you there were hundreds of deaths up and down that highway that just around there that year in automobiles.
[02:04:16.600 --> 02:04:27.600]  But see, that's called common sense. That's called reality. But they know how to do it. I didn't get to this last clip, but we'll play it when we come back because it's a threat.
[02:04:27.600 --> 02:04:36.600]  MSNBC says it's time to start going after NRA board members, businesses. Yeah, we've already been experiencing the real tyranny of these bullies.
[02:04:36.600 --> 02:04:46.600]  God help us if the people that staged the whole Kavanaugh-Balazi Ford Bank and are shipping all the Islamics in in front of the Arab Spring.
[02:04:46.600 --> 02:05:14.600]  Thank God for the founding fathers. Thank God for the Second Amendment. Thank our lucky stars.
[02:05:14.600 --> 02:05:19.600]  We've launched it, ladies and gentlemen. It's now live. Band.video.
[02:05:19.600 --> 02:05:26.600]  Band.video isn't just going to be a home for Alex Jones or David Knight or Owen Schreuer or Paul Watson band videos.
[02:05:26.600 --> 02:05:37.600]  We are building it to be a place where band memes are able to be posted and where a growing list of freedom-loving contributors are able to have a home free from being shut down,
[02:05:37.600 --> 02:05:44.600]  free from being censored, free from being silenced by big tech, the chai comms, the Hollywood scum, and the globalist.
[02:05:44.600 --> 02:06:03.600]  Freedom of speech has a home. It's called band.video. America and the world is fighting back against tyranny at band.video.
[02:06:03.600 --> 02:06:14.600]  The answer to 1984 is 1776. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[02:06:14.600 --> 02:06:22.600]  I'm standing in this briefing room right now. There is no government official here, but I'll say that the press is not the enemy of the people.
[02:06:22.600 --> 02:06:37.600]  But I'll say that the press is not the enemy of the people.
[02:06:37.600 --> 02:07:03.600]  The press is not the enemy of the people. They came in peace.
[02:07:03.600 --> 02:07:09.600]  Maybe we should go out on Pennsylvania Avenue like these folks who chant CNN sucks and fake news.
[02:07:09.600 --> 02:07:26.600]  Maybe we should go out, all journalists should go out on Pennsylvania Avenue and chant we're not the enemy of the people.
[02:07:26.600 --> 02:07:41.600]  We're not the enemy of the people.
[02:07:41.600 --> 02:07:57.600]  So they're not the enemy of the people. They're just all over the news saying bully us, attack us, antifa's good. It's like radiation.
[02:07:57.600 --> 02:08:01.600]  Somebody has cancer. We need to be beaten. Scalise needs to be shot. Trump needs to die. They need to level us.
[02:08:01.600 --> 02:08:12.600]  They need to teach us to submit. Trump's killed more than Hitler and Stalin. Where's the 100 million dead or whatever.
[02:08:12.600 --> 02:08:21.600]  By the way, I just did a little footnote. I didn't cover this Sunday. I meant to. The Polish president had Germany there apologizing to him for killing 6 million Poles.
[02:08:21.600 --> 02:08:26.600]  And by the way, they probably killed more than that. I mean, Nazi Germany just attacked Poland for no reason.
[02:08:26.600 --> 02:08:34.600]  And the president complained. He said, all we ever hear about is Israel and Jews getting reparations. We deserve it.
[02:08:34.600 --> 02:08:43.600]  By the way, I think the Jews deserve reparations from Germany and they've paid them for what they did. They definitely targeted Hitler, targeted Jews. That's a fact.
[02:08:43.600 --> 02:09:00.600]  But man, Hitler killed 20 million Russians, 6 plus million Poles and 22 million Germans died under Hitler. Hitler was the worst thing ever hit Germany.
[02:09:00.600 --> 02:09:09.600]  He was a megalomaniac and there's this movement because the media is such liars and so corrupt to then think, oh, Hitler must have been good.
[02:09:09.600 --> 02:09:15.600]  No folks, not good, very bad. And actually was manipulated by the West to do what he did.
[02:09:15.600 --> 02:09:22.600]  But I was actually watching part of that ceremony after it had happened. I think it happened on Friday, but I was reading about it on Saturday.
[02:09:22.600 --> 02:09:33.600]  And I've just studied what happened to Poland. Hitler attacked Poland first by staging a false flag attack on his own military bases in Operation Hemler at Gliwitz.
[02:09:33.600 --> 02:09:44.600]  And it just shows you how incredible history is and just how out of control things have gotten. And you see the world lining up again along the same power axes.
[02:09:44.600 --> 02:09:46.600]  It's just an amazing time to be alive.
[02:09:46.600 --> 02:09:55.600]  I want to go to your phone calls on what's been unfolding and the fact that they are coming after our guns.
[02:09:55.600 --> 02:10:07.600]  But speaking of CNN not being an enemy of the people, mainstream news, corporate news is calling to crash the economy, is supporting the Private Fellow Reserve, trying to block our recovery at China's behest.
[02:10:07.600 --> 02:10:13.600]  This is treason. And it's so outlandish people can't even believe what's happening.
[02:10:13.600 --> 02:10:18.600]  But we're winning and Trump's winning overall, but just barely. And that's what's so scary.
[02:10:18.600 --> 02:10:27.600]  And now all this Internet censorship is coming in as being run by Democrats in government and even the Rolling Stone magazine quotes them running the censorship.
[02:10:27.600 --> 02:10:38.600]  Big techs being told to do this. And they'll go to one hearing and they'll call for more censorship and they'll go to another hearing and the Democrats all read off a prepared statement.
[02:10:38.600 --> 02:10:47.600]  It's crazy. Google's never censored anybody. It's all lies. And then the very same Democrat will go in another hearing and call for more censorship.
[02:10:47.600 --> 02:10:56.600]  It's just this dual game and anybody could link up those clips. We should do that where they're saying there's no censorship and another committee hearing calling for it.
[02:10:56.600 --> 02:11:05.600]  So what do we do about this? What does Trump do about it? Because if you want to talk about someplace, Trump's dropped the ball miserably at his own extreme danger.
[02:11:05.600 --> 02:11:13.600]  Let me tell you, they get the big guy. A lot of us are going to have to leave the United States.
[02:11:13.600 --> 02:11:20.600]  The Democrats are going to put everybody in prison and they've said they are. In fact, here's a couple clips of them threatening people just recently.
[02:11:20.600 --> 02:11:29.600]  Trump has to lose, but all his enablers have to lose. We have to collectively, in essence, burn down the Republican Party.
[02:11:29.600 --> 02:11:36.600]  That sentiment at the core of the coalition cannot be pride-loose and it cannot be negotiated with and it cannot be appeased.
[02:11:36.600 --> 02:11:38.600]  We have to level them.
[02:11:38.600 --> 02:11:42.600]  Utterly confronted and destroyed. That is the only way to break the coalition apart.
[02:11:42.600 --> 02:11:48.600]  Because if there are survivors, if there are people who weather this storm, they will do it again.
[02:11:48.600 --> 02:11:51.600]  You have to go out and beat these folks if they don't agree with you.
[02:11:51.600 --> 02:11:56.600]  What we've got to do is fight in Congress, fight in the courts, fight in the streets.
[02:11:56.600 --> 02:12:07.600]  And if you see anybody from that cabinet in a restaurant, in a department store, in a gasoline station, you get out and you create a crowd.
[02:12:07.600 --> 02:12:15.600]  And you push back on them and you tell them they're not welcome any more, anywhere.
[02:12:15.600 --> 02:12:25.600]  What we should be doing is shunning these people. Shunning, shaming these people is a statement of moral indignation that these people are not fit for polite society.
[02:12:25.600 --> 02:12:31.600]  They have shamed themselves too much. The heart of the thing must be ripped out. The darkness must be banished.
[02:12:31.600 --> 02:12:38.600]  The people who feel moral revulsion at that display we saw last night must collectively mobilize in greater numbers than the chanters.
[02:12:38.600 --> 02:12:43.600]  Up and down the ticket, federal, state, local offices, the country has to repudiate this.
[02:12:43.600 --> 02:12:50.600]  The press always asks me, don't I wish I were debating him? No, I wish we were in high school, I could take him behind the gym.
[02:12:50.600 --> 02:12:52.600]  That's what I wish.
[02:12:52.600 --> 02:12:58.600]  If we were in high school, I'd take him behind the gym and beat the hell out of him.
[02:12:58.600 --> 02:13:03.600]  Let me give you one bottom line. As a former government official, government's going to kill this guy.
[02:13:03.600 --> 02:13:05.600]  That's so entertaining.
[02:13:05.600 --> 02:13:10.600]  And that's only to scratch the surface. We could cut in all the people threatening and harassing people at their homes.
[02:13:10.600 --> 02:13:18.600]  I could cut in. Wolf Blitzer saying, it's important to note the man that shot Scalise and tried to kill the other Republicans, he wasn't a monster.
[02:13:18.600 --> 02:13:21.600]  He was upset about what's happening in this country.
[02:13:21.600 --> 02:13:23.600]  Remember that clip?
[02:13:23.600 --> 02:13:28.600]  Here's another clip and we'll go to your calls.
[02:13:28.600 --> 02:13:39.600]  This is MSNBC saying Republicans are playing dirty pool with NRA board members. Go after their businesses.
[02:13:39.600 --> 02:13:50.600]  I think at this point, it's up to the advocates on gun safety to really start playing tough, dirty pool with the NRA and start going after their board members.
[02:13:50.600 --> 02:14:02.600]  We've seen it in boycotts on advertising. I think it's meant to hold every single member of that board accountable in their hometowns and go after them and their businesses and call them out.
[02:14:02.600 --> 02:14:12.600]  Because nothing will get changed until basically you're one or two steps removed from someone who's been touched by an act of gun violence.
[02:14:12.600 --> 02:14:19.600]  And we've seen one congressman get there, but unfortunately, I think until it hits a critical mass, we won't see it.
[02:14:19.600 --> 02:14:27.600]  Right, so Donnie Deutsch over there on MSNBC last week, members said, it's time to get dirty. It's time to play dirty.
[02:14:27.600 --> 02:14:29.600]  We know you've been playing dirty forever, bro.
[02:14:29.600 --> 02:14:33.600]  It's why I think God dirtbags like you don't have full control of the country.
[02:14:33.600 --> 02:14:39.600]  Every city you've got control of, though, is covered in feces, heroin needles, because the Democrats sell it to them.
[02:14:39.600 --> 02:14:45.600]  The Democrats are a gang. Whoever will pay them, they will follow the orders.
[02:14:45.600 --> 02:14:51.600]  And America's power was that we were open. It was also our weakness because they could then infiltrate us.
[02:14:51.600 --> 02:14:54.600]  And this country was on its knees three years ago.
[02:14:54.600 --> 02:15:00.600]  We're now on our feet. We've got serious wounds, but we're getting better fast.
[02:15:00.600 --> 02:15:05.600]  And that's why they're pulling out every stop they got because their whole system is going down.
[02:15:05.600 --> 02:15:09.600]  But it takes focus. It takes prayer. It takes commitment. It takes word of mouth.
[02:15:09.600 --> 02:15:11.600]  Don't just think of yourself as a bit player in this.
[02:15:11.600 --> 02:15:17.600]  You are the literal bloodstream, the brain, the eyes, the guts, the sinew, the bone, the will, the spirit.
[02:15:17.600 --> 02:15:21.600]  You are the law. You are the people. We the people, remember?
[02:15:21.600 --> 02:15:30.600]  And when you tell people about this live show, about infowars.com, or newswars.com, or band.video,
[02:15:30.600 --> 02:15:35.600]  that's got David Knight's, my videos, all of them. It's about that bunch of other contributors, band.video.
[02:15:35.600 --> 02:15:37.600]  That's a URL that isn't censored yet, so share it, band.video.
[02:15:37.600 --> 02:15:41.600]  When you do that, it moves the ball down the field like nothing else.
[02:15:41.600 --> 02:15:48.600]  So, we're in the huddle right now. Millions listening, but we're still 11 members on this team.
[02:15:48.600 --> 02:16:12.600]  We've got to fight hard. We're going to win.
[02:16:12.600 --> 02:16:19.600]  A bold statement you bit. See them now at survivalistcamps.com. That's survivalistcamps.com.
[02:16:19.600 --> 02:16:43.600]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla. I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house. I sued the IRS in one. I beat the IRS then, and I've been beating them ever since.
[02:16:43.600 --> 02:16:58.600]  I've been beating them ever since.
[02:16:58.600 --> 02:17:20.600]  My blood pressure has normalized. My diabetes has totally improved.
[02:17:20.600 --> 02:17:27.600]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look, and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel. I recommend heart and body extract to everyone.
[02:17:27.600 --> 02:17:35.600]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.

[02:18:53.600 --> 02:19:00.600]  Supermail Vitality is already in the top three of our best sellers for the six years we've had it.
[02:19:00.600 --> 02:19:08.600]  It is an award-winning formula produced in Utah by one of the top herbal companies in the nation that we've been private labeling.
[02:19:08.600 --> 02:19:16.600]  It is cold pressed. It takes at least three times the herbs that are wild crafted and organic to be able to produce this.
[02:19:16.600 --> 02:19:24.600]  It's not boiled. It's not heated. It's never been dried. It's taken from fresh herbs. That's why it's so strong.
[02:19:24.600 --> 02:19:33.600]  That's why it's so effective for libido, stamina and energy. And I'm so excited about Supermail Vitality and Carnivore 30

[02:20:19.600 --> 02:20:27.600]  More bizarre zombie-like attacks. People just start eating the flesh out of other folks.
[02:20:27.600 --> 02:20:32.600]  It used to be a big deal when it first happened in Miami back in 2012. Now it's every day.
[02:20:32.600 --> 02:20:38.600]  We've got Islamists just doing mass stabbings everywhere. So many reports. I can't even cover them all.
[02:20:38.600 --> 02:20:41.600]  There is just so much to get to, but I want to go to your phone calls right now.
[02:20:41.600 --> 02:20:49.600]  In the last segment of this hour, Hollywood is involved in a revelation of the method, an externalization of the hierarchy,
[02:20:49.600 --> 02:20:54.600]  or what you call predictive programming. Now this particular piece we're going to air in the final segment,
[02:20:54.600 --> 02:21:00.600]  I think was done by people, though, that are on the good side. There's no way this is preparing you for this.
[02:21:00.600 --> 02:21:06.600]  This is something where they're warning you. And it ties into Hunter S. Thompson. I'm going to leave it at that.
[02:21:06.600 --> 02:21:12.600]  This is a particular video that YouTube banned. Part of this report's new. Part of this is old.
[02:21:12.600 --> 02:21:20.600]  YouTube said that it was discriminatory against Satanist.
[02:21:20.600 --> 02:21:25.600]  We're like, that's ridiculous. No, you don't talk about how it's wrong that they like to kill children.
[02:21:25.600 --> 02:21:30.600]  That's a sacrament. They're the protected group. You're going to learn.
[02:21:30.600 --> 02:21:36.600]  So that's coming up in the last segment of this hour before Paul Joseph Watson takes over. You'll want to stay with us.
[02:21:36.600 --> 02:21:39.600]  Let's go to your calls. The two big questions. Have you just joined us?
[02:21:39.600 --> 02:21:43.600]  I'm asking the listeners, what do we do about the Democrats saying we're going to take all your guns?
[02:21:43.600 --> 02:21:46.600]  Not just semi-auto. Time to repeal the Second Amendment. They're everywhere.
[02:21:46.600 --> 02:21:50.600]  Time to get violent. Time to intimidate us. I mean, this is getting crazy.
[02:21:50.600 --> 02:21:56.600]  As if it's our fault that psychos kill people with a car or a knife or a car or a baseball bat.
[02:21:56.600 --> 02:22:03.600]  It doesn't matter what it is. It's the bad person. When Islamics stab people constantly, do we blame butcher knives?
[02:22:03.600 --> 02:22:08.600]  No, of course we don't. Or you've got butcher knives in your home. How long will we put up with this
[02:22:08.600 --> 02:22:13.600]  that another 10 people got stabbed in France yesterday at one stop and another 20 other places
[02:22:13.600 --> 02:22:18.600]  and a bunch of deaths and you damn chefs in France that own these big butcher knives?
[02:22:18.600 --> 02:22:21.600]  How much will you put up with your all guilty bloods on your hands?
[02:22:21.600 --> 02:22:27.600]  We had another Islamic run over 50 people or 100 people or 200 people. Remember that?
[02:22:27.600 --> 02:22:36.600]  On Christmas. How dare you drive trucks? It's all your fault, you big long-haul 18-wheeler drivers.
[02:22:36.600 --> 02:22:39.600]  We've got to get on the offense. How do we do that?
[02:22:39.600 --> 02:22:43.600]  And then what do you think about the Democrats admitting they're working with government groups
[02:22:43.600 --> 02:22:47.600]  to censor everybody and that its government orders a censor and it's even in Rolling Stone magazine
[02:22:47.600 --> 02:22:54.600]  that the Democrats are the ones running the censoring and its government ordered and Trump still won't do anything?
[02:22:54.600 --> 02:23:03.600]  Brandon, Steve, Judy, Chase, Pam, Ken, Jerome, Vlad, Alex, Brad, we're going to everybody before we end this transmission.
[02:23:03.600 --> 02:23:07.600]  Vlad in Washington. You're on the air. Thanks for holding.
[02:23:07.600 --> 02:23:12.600]  Yeah. Hi, Mr. Jones. I actually wanted to talk about the illegal actions that the dens are doing.
[02:23:12.600 --> 02:23:16.600]  But before I get into that, I find it kind of funny that you mentioned the 18-wheeler drivers
[02:23:16.600 --> 02:23:20.600]  because I'm actually a long-haul driver myself. I have been since 2010.
[02:23:20.600 --> 02:23:25.600]  And it's just kind of hilarious because sometimes in Europe, you know, a Muslim will grab an 18-wheeler,
[02:23:25.600 --> 02:23:31.600]  he'll run over a bunch of people and they'll say, oh, should we ban 18-wheeler? No, you don't ban something
[02:23:31.600 --> 02:23:35.600]  because one individual that's a lunatic did something. Same thing for the guns.
[02:23:35.600 --> 02:23:38.600]  You don't ban them because some lunatic did something horrible.
[02:23:38.600 --> 02:23:40.600]  And again, what I'm trying to get into.
[02:23:40.600 --> 02:23:46.600]  Even though mass shootings are up, no one can lie, they didn't exist until Harrison Clybold,
[02:23:46.600 --> 02:23:51.600]  basically in the media hyping at study show, is triggering crazies to think of it as an option.
[02:23:51.600 --> 02:23:55.600]  The media knows exactly what they're doing. Sorry.
[02:23:55.600 --> 02:23:58.600]  Well, that's why they keep covering all these mass shootings because they want copycats
[02:23:58.600 --> 02:24:01.600]  and they want this to keep happening over and over so then they can come out and say,
[02:24:01.600 --> 02:24:04.600]  we need to ban guns and they're the ones that are hyping the entire problem.
[02:24:04.600 --> 02:24:06.600]  Exactly.
[02:24:06.600 --> 02:24:12.600]  That's what I want to kind of say is, in my opinion, Trump, he seems to be baiting the Dems all the time.
[02:24:12.600 --> 02:24:17.600]  I mean, as an example with millennia running around talking about expanded background checks,
[02:24:17.600 --> 02:24:21.600]  Trump's not going to sign it. He didn't sign a lot of the other anti-gun garbage that's been going around.
[02:24:21.600 --> 02:24:24.600]  I think what he's doing is more of a long game.
[02:24:24.600 --> 02:24:30.600]  In my opinion, this is the Patriots' phase of evidence gathering against YouTube, Facebook, Alphabet,
[02:24:30.600 --> 02:24:36.600]  and Komi with the entire Kill Republicans agenda with the Kill Trump thing going on all over social media
[02:24:36.600 --> 02:24:41.600]  with actual politicians and certain mainstream media even talking about that we need to get rid of Trump.
[02:24:41.600 --> 02:24:44.600]  We need to get rid of Republicans. We can never stop.
[02:24:44.600 --> 02:24:47.600]  We have to basically pile them down and get rid of them everywhere.
[02:24:47.600 --> 02:24:54.600]  In my opinion, this is basically the Patriots' gathering evidence of all these traders that are committing crimes
[02:24:54.600 --> 02:24:58.600]  and committing treason publicly and they're documenting everything in the background.
[02:24:58.600 --> 02:25:02.600]  It's about the tens of thousands of field indictments that are currently on the books as of right now.
[02:25:02.600 --> 02:25:04.600]  There's tens of thousands of them if you go look at it right now.
[02:25:04.600 --> 02:25:08.600]  I mean, long story short, in my opinion, I think we need to trust Trump.
[02:25:08.600 --> 02:25:14.600]  I don't agree with 100% of everything he does, but the vast majority of it, in my opinion, I just say trust Trump.
[02:25:14.600 --> 02:25:18.600]  Sure. Well, Vlad, I run into a lot of people I respect that like the whole Q thing.
[02:25:18.600 --> 02:25:22.600]  And so, you know, I'm not going to sit here and attack the whole Q thing.
[02:25:22.600 --> 02:25:27.600]  I just know this. I actually have talked to two NRA board members, okay?
[02:25:27.600 --> 02:25:32.600]  And they told me exactly what you just said, that Trump literally said,
[02:25:32.600 --> 02:25:37.600]  look, I'll tell them, we'll do what you want, then they'll call for total confiscation and get nothing.
[02:25:37.600 --> 02:25:41.600]  I still don't like that type of manipulation, but I get what Trump's doing.
[02:25:41.600 --> 02:25:45.600]  And now I told you that he was going to come out and say, no, we're not doing it.
[02:25:45.600 --> 02:25:47.600]  It doesn't protect anybody. It wouldn't have saved anybody.
[02:25:47.600 --> 02:25:51.600]  And he did exactly that last week and again this weekend and again yesterday.
[02:25:51.600 --> 02:25:57.600]  So you're absolutely correct, but that's not from Q. That is directly from NRA board members.
[02:25:57.600 --> 02:26:00.600]  I mean, you understand that Ted Nugent's on the NRA board, right?
[02:26:00.600 --> 02:26:04.600]  I'm not going to say he told me that, but I asked Ted on air when he was on a few weeks ago.
[02:26:04.600 --> 02:26:07.600]  I said, is this true? Have you heard this from other members?
[02:26:07.600 --> 02:26:10.600]  And he said, yes, I appreciate your call. God bless you.
[02:26:10.600 --> 02:26:13.600]  Okay, let's go to another ring of dingy here.
[02:26:13.600 --> 02:26:20.600]  Let's go ahead and talk to Chase in California. Thanks for calling.
[02:26:20.600 --> 02:26:23.600]  Hey, Alex, thanks for taking my call so much.
[02:26:23.600 --> 02:26:25.600]  And real quick, with that fluoride report that came out,
[02:26:25.600 --> 02:26:30.600]  make sure everybody gets their super blue toothpaste, fluoride free so you can brush your teeth with some freedom.
[02:26:30.600 --> 02:26:33.600]  Hey, you know, there's so many attacks coming out of the Second Amendment.
[02:26:33.600 --> 02:26:35.600]  We got it from the corporate world today.
[02:26:35.600 --> 02:26:39.600]  Walmart just announced that they're going to be banning all handgun ammunition cells.
[02:26:39.600 --> 02:26:42.600]  We also get it from a historical attack.
[02:26:42.600 --> 02:26:46.600]  You realize that they're waving red flags in our faces right now trying to take our guns.
[02:26:46.600 --> 02:26:50.600]  Let's go back in history. Mao Zedong waved a red flag and took some guns.
[02:26:50.600 --> 02:26:53.600]  Stalin waved a red flag and took some guns.
[02:26:53.600 --> 02:26:57.600]  And now we have these Democrats with Senate Bill 66 trying to ban assault weapons.
[02:26:57.600 --> 02:27:03.600]  But the good news, Alex, is House Bill 38 trying to get concealed, carry reciprocity.
[02:27:03.600 --> 02:27:09.600]  Listen, I want to get to that solution, getting on the offense and getting stuff repealed to properly defend ourselves.
[02:27:09.600 --> 02:27:11.600]  That's the answer. But you're right.
[02:27:11.600 --> 02:27:15.600]  Every time the red flag of terror comes out under Lenin, under Stalin, under Mao,
[02:27:15.600 --> 02:27:18.600]  tens of millions die when they confiscate the guns.
[02:27:18.600 --> 02:27:20.600]  You just made an incredibly good point.
[02:27:20.600 --> 02:27:23.600]  When they took over 1917, they ordered everybody that had guns to turn them in.
[02:27:23.600 --> 02:27:27.600]  They then killed millions of people. That is a great point.
[02:27:27.600 --> 02:27:30.600]  So, Alex, I don't see how this hasn't been seen before.
[02:27:30.600 --> 02:27:32.600]  I've been trying to make the noise on my side.
[02:27:32.600 --> 02:27:36.600]  You know, I go live every night and I talked about this very topic last night.
[02:27:36.600 --> 02:27:39.600]  It was weird that you're bringing it up today because, yes, the Democrats,
[02:27:39.600 --> 02:27:43.600]  if you look on their legislative calendar, they have a number of bills they're trying to go at.
[02:27:43.600 --> 02:27:48.600]  And just historically, I can't believe Americans don't see the red flag as a warning.
[02:27:48.600 --> 02:27:51.600]  They're trying to disarm you. They're trying to murder tens of millions.
[02:27:51.600 --> 02:27:53.600]  And I want to be clear. I want to be clear.
[02:27:53.600 --> 02:27:56.600]  The Democrats have said they want violence. They've said they want to attack us.
[02:27:56.600 --> 02:27:59.600]  They've said they want to go after Christians. This is an evil group.
[02:27:59.600 --> 02:28:02.600]  And so, absolutely, it's not hyperbole. It's not hype.
[02:28:02.600 --> 02:28:05.600]  They're coming for your guns. They're coming for your children.
[02:28:05.600 --> 02:28:08.600]  They are an evil group. They are committed to evil.
[02:28:08.600 --> 02:28:11.600]  And the answer is handgun reciprocity nationwide.
[02:28:11.600 --> 02:28:15.600]  The answer is arming good people so that we stop these psychotics instantly,
[02:28:15.600 --> 02:28:18.600]  whether they're stabbing or using a truck or a gun.
[02:28:18.600 --> 02:28:21.600]  The answer is get people off the psychotropics that make them do this.
[02:28:21.600 --> 02:28:26.600]  Outlaw psychotropics now. Outlaw drugs that make people go psychotic.
[02:28:26.600 --> 02:28:30.600]  Great point. Chase. That's Chase in California.
[02:28:30.600 --> 02:28:33.600]  I think his handles Chase the Patriot. I've seen some of his videos. They're excellent.
[02:28:33.600 --> 02:28:38.600]  All right, Brandon, Stephen, Judy, Pam, Ken, Jerome, Mike, Alex, Brad,
[02:28:38.600 --> 02:28:41.600]  you're all straight ahead, but I've got one question for you.
[02:28:41.600 --> 02:28:45.600]  We're in a war. Terrorities come to our shores. It's real.
[02:28:45.600 --> 02:28:49.600]  My job is to get people awake and take an action. Are you taking action?
[02:28:49.600 --> 02:29:09.600]  Get the word out.
[02:29:19.600 --> 02:29:34.600]  We're in a war.
[02:29:34.600 --> 02:29:57.600]  We're in a war.
[02:29:57.600 --> 02:30:12.600]  We're in a war.
[02:30:12.600 --> 02:30:38.600]  We're in a war.
[02:30:38.600 --> 02:31:04.600]  We're in a war.
[02:31:04.600 --> 02:31:30.600]  We're in a war.
[02:31:30.600 --> 02:31:56.600]  We're in a war.
[02:31:56.600 --> 02:32:22.600]  We're in a war.
[02:32:22.600 --> 02:32:48.600]  We're in a war.
[02:32:48.600 --> 02:33:15.600]  We're in a war.
[02:33:15.600 --> 02:33:43.600]  We're in a war.
[02:33:43.600 --> 02:33:47.600]  Right now, let's move quickly from Pam to Brandon to all these amazing callers
[02:33:47.600 --> 02:33:51.600]  so we can get them all in. Pam in California on Internet censorship
[02:33:51.600 --> 02:33:55.600]  and what you think Trump should do. Thank you for spending time with us on Tuesday.
[02:33:55.600 --> 02:33:58.600]  Alex, thank you for taking my call. How are you doing today?
[02:33:58.600 --> 02:34:00.600]  I'm pretty fired up. I'm feeling pretty good.
[02:34:00.600 --> 02:34:04.600]  I just had a question. I think Trump is a good guy,
[02:34:04.600 --> 02:34:07.600]  but I did some research on Jared Kushner,
[02:34:07.600 --> 02:34:13.600]  and I saw that he's had some interest with George Soros with getting some loans from him,
[02:34:13.600 --> 02:34:17.600]  and that also he has interest in stocks for big tech, including Google.
[02:34:17.600 --> 02:34:21.600]  Do you think that maybe he's advising Trump not to do anything about big tech
[02:34:21.600 --> 02:34:23.600]  and that's why he's not doing anything?
[02:34:23.600 --> 02:34:28.600]  Absolutely. I have had Steve Pachettic two years ago, three years ago,
[02:34:28.600 --> 02:34:33.600]  saying, hey, he's worried about Kushner because of loans from the Chinese
[02:34:33.600 --> 02:34:38.600]  and loans from Soros, and of course that's true,
[02:34:38.600 --> 02:34:42.600]  and it's just kind of weird to buy an apartment building or an office building
[02:34:42.600 --> 02:34:47.600]  for two times what it's worth at 666, whatever.
[02:34:47.600 --> 02:34:52.600]  But there's a lot of people hate Kushner. They obsess over it all day long.
[02:34:52.600 --> 02:34:55.600]  Trump has not taken action like he should on big tech yet.
[02:34:55.600 --> 02:34:58.600]  I've seen articles where Kushner's been out with his wife,
[02:34:58.600 --> 02:35:03.600]  with Google executives at dinner, and yeah, I think it's a big problem.
[02:35:03.600 --> 02:35:08.600]  So I don't want to say Kushner's the culprit because I can't prove that.
[02:35:08.600 --> 02:35:14.600]  What I've tried to learn is, at those levels, I'm not sure exactly who's doing what,
[02:35:14.600 --> 02:35:18.600]  and listen, Soros has got his fingers in everything,
[02:35:18.600 --> 02:35:21.600]  and so the fact that some of the companies he's been invested in in New York
[02:35:21.600 --> 02:35:23.600]  have Soros connections or Chinese connections.
[02:35:23.600 --> 02:35:27.600]  The Chai comms have their arm literally in everything, not just their fingers.
[02:35:27.600 --> 02:35:30.600]  But I think that's something that should be looked up.
[02:35:30.600 --> 02:35:34.600]  Well, thank you very much. I appreciate everything that you do. God bless you.
[02:35:34.600 --> 02:35:36.600]  Thank you. What do you think Trump should do? You had a comment on that.
[02:35:36.600 --> 02:35:37.600]  What Trump should do?
[02:35:37.600 --> 02:35:42.600]  Well, I think that he should stop listening to Kushner and do what you're telling him to do,
[02:35:42.600 --> 02:35:46.600]  and other people have told him to do instead of listening to what he's telling him
[02:35:46.600 --> 02:35:47.600]  if that's what he's doing.
[02:35:47.600 --> 02:35:50.600]  Well, I know this. I know this. I've been threatened. I've been harassed.
[02:35:50.600 --> 02:35:53.600]  Most people, I know they get threatened and get harassed,
[02:35:53.600 --> 02:35:55.600]  kind of roll over to the globalists, at least partially.
[02:35:55.600 --> 02:36:00.600]  And so if somebody isn't really tough, they shouldn't be in Trump's immediate circle.
[02:36:00.600 --> 02:36:03.600]  I don't know if Kushner has been blackmailed or something,
[02:36:03.600 --> 02:36:09.600]  but his dad went to prison for stuff and, you know, the whole thing, the whole thing,
[02:36:09.600 --> 02:36:13.600]  the whole thing smells, but there's a lot of stuff stinking up in DC,
[02:36:13.600 --> 02:36:15.600]  so I'm not exactly sure what it is, but thank you.
[02:36:15.600 --> 02:36:17.600]  I think it should be looked at. Thank you, Pam.
[02:36:17.600 --> 02:36:21.600]  Okay, up next, let's go ahead. We're going to go to Judy and then Brandon.
[02:36:21.600 --> 02:36:24.600]  Judy and Florida, thanks for calling today. Go ahead.
[02:36:24.600 --> 02:36:31.600]  Hey, Alex, I was sort of coming at it from a different angle about this censorship.
[02:36:31.600 --> 02:36:36.600]  And this is just my thought process on something that may be happening.
[02:36:36.600 --> 02:36:42.600]  It could be a form of blackmail and I'm going to tie this into Hurricane Dorian.
[02:36:42.600 --> 02:36:47.600]  And this is just, it could be something real.
[02:36:47.600 --> 02:36:52.600]  It could be something that even though I saw it on satellite imagery,
[02:36:52.600 --> 02:36:58.600]  being microwave imagery, it could or could not be reason for censorship.
[02:36:58.600 --> 02:37:04.600]  But long story short, there is imagery of a directed energy
[02:37:04.600 --> 02:37:10.600]  that is coming from the west going southeast underneath Dorian
[02:37:10.600 --> 02:37:13.600]  as it's approaching the Bahamas.
[02:37:13.600 --> 02:37:17.600]  And CNN, probably one of the only true things they said
[02:37:17.600 --> 02:37:22.600]  is that it was going to sit over the Bahamas for about 36 hours.
[02:37:22.600 --> 02:37:27.600]  And what my point is, is that they could have blackmailed the president saying,
[02:37:27.600 --> 02:37:31.600]  well, if you don't like play ball with us, we could take out, you know,
[02:37:31.600 --> 02:37:34.600]  several thousand people off the eastern seaboard.
[02:37:34.600 --> 02:37:39.600]  We can take Fort Pierce and Palm Beach where the second White House is while we're at it.
[02:37:39.600 --> 02:37:42.600]  What do you think?
[02:37:42.600 --> 02:37:48.600]  And I appreciate your call. About six, seven years ago, a woman called after a record-sized tornado
[02:37:48.600 --> 02:37:52.600]  hit Oklahoma City and killed a bunch of people and she said, could it be a weather weapon?
[02:37:52.600 --> 02:37:56.600]  And I said, well, weather weapons are admitted and they're declassified.
[02:37:56.600 --> 02:38:00.600]  And I quoted former Secretary of Defense William Cohen about it in 1997 in Army Times
[02:38:00.600 --> 02:38:04.600]  and showed some articles. But I said, but we don't know if this was, probably wasn't.
[02:38:04.600 --> 02:38:07.600]  You know, it was the springtime. It is Hurricane Alley.
[02:38:07.600 --> 02:38:12.600]  Hurricane Alley runs all the way, you know, up from, you know, basically from Michigan right now
[02:38:12.600 --> 02:38:17.600]  into San Antonio, Texas. That said, Trump was rumored as saying,
[02:38:17.600 --> 02:38:20.600]  why don't we just blow up this hurricane? Then he did not. He said it.
[02:38:20.600 --> 02:38:23.600]  You can type in Bill Gates looks to control hurricanes.
[02:38:23.600 --> 02:38:28.600]  They have the technology to kill hurricanes, to strengthen hurricanes, to steer hurricanes.
[02:38:28.600 --> 02:38:32.600]  Weather manipulation is real. It's been real for 50 years.
[02:38:32.600 --> 02:38:36.600]  It's really a 60, 70 years. It's a science now.
[02:38:36.600 --> 02:38:42.600]  And so this is a very unusual category five now down to a whatever, four or three.
[02:38:42.600 --> 02:38:48.600]  And it is weird how it sat over the Bahamas and how strong the eye wall was.
[02:38:48.600 --> 02:38:54.600]  But the Stanford Research Institute, the Navy certified in 67 that they could create hurricanes,
[02:38:54.600 --> 02:38:58.600]  kill hurricanes, steer hurricanes, weaken hurricanes.
[02:38:58.600 --> 02:39:01.600]  I mean, I've had the father weather weapons on been Livingston.
[02:39:01.600 --> 02:39:07.600]  And he's something I had him on to see if he's still alive. He was the guy that first flew into typhoons
[02:39:07.600 --> 02:39:11.600]  at the end of World War Two as first weather, you know, planes.
[02:39:11.600 --> 02:39:17.600]  And that was all classified till 2002. And I got him on the show.
[02:39:17.600 --> 02:39:20.600]  So there is weather underground. Bill Gates takes on hurricanes.
[02:39:20.600 --> 02:39:23.600]  So it's very legitimate to say that very legitimate to question that.
[02:39:23.600 --> 02:39:28.600]  And so I appreciate your call. Really powerful subject you just brought up.
[02:39:28.600 --> 02:39:34.600]  Let's talk to a caller in Portland and then the Brandon Alex in Portland, you're on the air.
[02:39:34.600 --> 02:39:37.600]  Hello. Yes, sir. Thank you.
[02:39:37.600 --> 02:39:39.600]  Thank you for sticking my call, sir. Yes, sir.
[02:39:39.600 --> 02:39:46.600]  So I wanted to talk about some things that you've said and some things that we've seen about how everybody's kind of on the back pedal,
[02:39:46.600 --> 02:39:49.600]  you know, the apology tours and things like that.
[02:39:49.600 --> 02:39:57.600]  And I think it's, I think it's happening as, you know, normal people just as well, not necessarily just bigger heads.
[02:39:57.600 --> 02:40:01.600]  I try and wake people up and show people the links and all that sort of stuff.
[02:40:01.600 --> 02:40:05.600]  And when I say, hey, the government's putting fluoride in the water to make you stupid.
[02:40:05.600 --> 02:40:11.600]  And the top response that I've gotten to that was, oh, doesn't surprise me.
[02:40:11.600 --> 02:40:16.600]  Okay. Well, it doesn't surprise you. Does it bother you? Do you have issue with it?
[02:40:16.600 --> 02:40:24.600]  I've been thinking about it. And it's almost as if, you know, somebody is in a really, really bad domestic violence situation.
[02:40:24.600 --> 02:40:28.600]  And they're so far down the rabbit hole. They apologize to the abuser.
[02:40:28.600 --> 02:40:33.600]  Oh, yeah, I call it mass Stockholm syndrome.
[02:40:33.600 --> 02:40:37.600]  Trying to fight that every day. And it's tough. It's tough to do it to one person.
[02:40:37.600 --> 02:40:43.600]  But you're right. We went from them denying that fluorides are to dumb us down or that cell phones kill us to like, okay, so what?
[02:40:43.600 --> 02:40:47.600]  So again, there's the helplessness, but just let them be helpless and move on.
[02:40:47.600 --> 02:40:55.600]  The people that care was 3% won the Revolutionary War. 1% started it when the Brits started it. We're going to do that again, brother.
[02:40:55.600 --> 02:40:59.600]  God bless you. Great. Thank you so much. It's time for political action.
[02:40:59.600 --> 02:41:05.600]  I'm sorry. I got so many calls with everybody. Brandon in California, you're on the air. Welcome.
[02:41:05.600 --> 02:41:08.600]  Hello. Yes, sir. Go ahead.
[02:41:08.600 --> 02:41:14.600]  Hey, Alex, I've been listening to you for like 10 years. I'm a huge fan, man. Love your products.
[02:41:14.600 --> 02:41:18.600]  I'm a fan of you, brother. We wouldn't be here without you and all the other people.
[02:41:18.600 --> 02:41:27.600]  Thanks. Well, basically, I wanted to call and talk about big tech censorship and, you know, Tulsi Gabbard right now, she's suing Google for like 50 million.
[02:41:27.600 --> 02:41:33.600]  Why can't we like line her up with that? Help out with the lawsuit and then somehow get her connected with Trump.
[02:41:33.600 --> 02:41:40.600]  They agree on what's most important for all of us and it's like ending TPP, checking Silicon Valley and ending the foreign wars.
[02:41:40.600 --> 02:41:44.600]  And the rest of it could be pillow talk between them two in the White House. You know what I mean?
[02:41:44.600 --> 02:41:48.600]  Well, that would be a powerful ticket. You know, Trump would definitely want that ticket.
[02:41:48.600 --> 02:41:54.600]  I'm not trying to say you're rid of Pence, but it's definitely an issue. You're absolutely right about that.
[02:41:54.600 --> 02:42:03.600]  And it's just up to us. It's up to us because, look, we can sit there and sue big tech all day and that's important.
[02:42:03.600 --> 02:42:08.600]  It's being run by the NSA. They set it up. That's why we can't get rid of it.
[02:42:08.600 --> 02:42:14.600]  That's why Trump isn't moving against it because the intelligence agencies are ignoring what Trump says.
[02:42:14.600 --> 02:42:18.600]  Right. And the establishment, they're just, they're just moving in on both of them.
[02:42:18.600 --> 02:42:24.600]  Like I read an NBC article about a month ago saying that Russian propagandists are putting Tulsi Gabbard up.
[02:42:24.600 --> 02:42:29.600]  And immediately my first thought when I saw that was the enemy of my enemy is my friend.
[02:42:29.600 --> 02:42:31.600]  Yeah, but what's really going on is the Russians have nothing to do with it.
[02:42:31.600 --> 02:42:36.600]  When you hear Russian, that means the American people. That means you, I mean, she obviously won those debates.
[02:42:36.600 --> 02:42:39.600]  She's good looking. She's smart. She's not controlled. She's a breath of fresh air.
[02:42:39.600 --> 02:42:43.600]  And so they're telling you she's a Russian. But that's all it is. Okay.
[02:42:43.600 --> 02:42:45.600]  And these are the globalists that hate our country.
[02:42:45.600 --> 02:42:47.600]  Now get ready. You want to know what the globalists are all about?
[02:42:47.600 --> 02:42:50.600]  We go to the bottom of the rabbit hole on the other side.
[02:42:53.600 --> 02:42:59.600]  Supermail vitality is already in the top three of our best sellers for the six years we've had it.
[02:42:59.600 --> 02:43:07.600]  It is a award-winning formula produced in Utah by one of the top herbal companies in the nation that we've been private labeling.
[02:43:07.600 --> 02:43:15.600]  It is cold pressed. It takes at least three times the herbs that are wildcrafted and organic to be able to produce this.
[02:43:15.600 --> 02:43:20.600]  It's not boiled. It's not heated. It's never been dried. It's taken from fresh herbs.
[02:43:20.600 --> 02:43:27.600]  That's why it's so strong. That's why it's so effective for libido, stamina and energy.
[02:43:27.600 --> 02:43:36.600]  And I'm so excited about Supermail Vitality and Carnivore 30 that I'm offering you with every order of Supermail Vitality
[02:43:36.600 --> 02:43:41.600]  at 25% off a free bottle of Carnivore digestive enzyme.

[02:44:07.600 --> 02:44:15.600]  Now as we enter the 2020 election cycle, it's more important than ever that there be a place where the censors are unable to block the signal.

[02:45:13.600 --> 02:45:17.600]  One is naturally set up with grapefruit essential oils. The other is unscented.

[02:47:14.600 --> 02:47:33.600]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for joining us again on this Tuesday, Global Transmission, September 3rd, 2019.
[02:47:33.600 --> 02:47:38.600]  Now, not much good comes out of Netflix and Hollywood.
[02:47:38.600 --> 02:47:46.600]  They're being paid by the Chicoms and others to demoralize the people of the West and get us to hate ourselves and give up on our life force and stop fighting back.
[02:47:46.600 --> 02:47:54.600]  So we can be poisoned by the GMO, the tainted, laced, cancer virus filled vaccines, the 5G, all of it.
[02:47:54.600 --> 02:48:07.600]  But studying where the rumors and the legends of vampires came from, it came from certain percentage of people, very low percentage are psychotics who actually lust after blood and the flesh of humans.
[02:48:07.600 --> 02:48:12.600]  It's actually a listed mental illness.
[02:48:12.600 --> 02:48:19.600]  And I've likened the globalist to Skexies, that early 1980s film with, you know, the big puppets or whatever.
[02:48:19.600 --> 02:48:29.600]  And I didn't even know that Netflix had come back out with a prequel to it, so we discover who the Skexies are and what they're doing.
[02:48:29.600 --> 02:48:38.600]  But when you watch this film, you have to understand that metaphorically the establishment sucks our energy, our ideas out, and destroys our civilization.
[02:48:38.600 --> 02:48:43.600]  But when you really study the establishment throughout history, it's been documented.
[02:48:43.600 --> 02:48:53.600]  And it's in, of course, the Stanley Kubrick film, Clockwork Orange, when they're at the milk bar, one of the drugs you can take is Adrena Chrome.
[02:48:53.600 --> 02:49:02.600]  And then, of course, in Hunter S. Thompson's Fear in Loving Las Vegas, he gets Adrena Chrome from a Satanist child molester through the guy's lawyer.
[02:49:02.600 --> 02:49:14.600]  That's somebody's actual adrenal or the pituitary in the brain that basically orders the release of the hormones throughout the body.
[02:49:14.600 --> 02:49:26.600]  And so this goes on and on and on, and then if you look at the injection bottles for the single, you know, shot with the EpiPens, that drug is called Adrena Chrome.
[02:49:26.600 --> 02:49:35.600]  And so if you read this, if you study this, if you look into this, you discover that the globalists are obsessed with blood transfusions of children.
[02:49:35.600 --> 02:49:39.600]  I told you that 25 years ago. Now they have companies that publicly do it.
[02:49:39.600 --> 02:49:44.600]  And, of course, the Queen Mother reportedly got them every week, and it made her live to 100-something.
[02:49:44.600 --> 02:49:49.600]  So this is also metaphysical. It's metaphoric for the elite feeding on us.
[02:49:49.600 --> 02:49:54.600]  But there's something there that you need to look into, and it's why they're obsessed with the youth.
[02:49:54.600 --> 02:50:01.600]  So Dark Crystal, Age of Resistance Prequel, just premiered a few days ago.
[02:50:01.600 --> 02:50:05.600]  Skexies came to the planet, Thrall, where all the creatures lived in harmony.
[02:50:05.600 --> 02:50:10.600]  They tricked the keeper of the crystal to let them guard it and use it to achieve long life.
[02:50:10.600 --> 02:50:17.600]  As the start of the thousand years have passed and the crystal was not working, so they must figure out a way to maintain everlasting life.
[02:50:17.600 --> 02:50:24.600]  The Skexies looking for a new way to extend their life, figure out how to use the crystal to put out the essence.
[02:50:24.600 --> 02:50:31.600]  They must use young, gentle, gethlings, which are children at heart or innocent.
[02:50:31.600 --> 02:50:36.600]  First, they torture the gethling by putting it in front of a crystal. They then drain their essence, the adrenochrome,
[02:50:36.600 --> 02:50:40.600]  and then drink out the essence of rejuvenation.
[02:50:40.600 --> 02:50:48.600]  Another gethling sees this and runs, but the head scientist says, don't worry. No one will believe him.
[02:50:48.600 --> 02:50:52.600]  No one will believe the fluoride is meant to dumb you down and hurt your fertility.
[02:50:52.600 --> 02:50:55.600]  No one will believe the GMO is meant to give you cancer.
[02:50:55.600 --> 02:50:58.600]  No one will believe the 3 and 5 and 4G is designed to kill you.
[02:50:58.600 --> 02:51:05.600]  This is their religion. But instead of physically sucking it out of you, when they do evil,
[02:51:05.600 --> 02:51:10.600]  they get invigorated and feel powerful because they're taking charge.
[02:51:10.600 --> 02:51:17.600]  They're the boss. They're the Satanist, willing to do these terrible things, including the physical drinking of blood of a tortured child,
[02:51:17.600 --> 02:51:21.600]  which is filled with the hormones and filled with the fear and the terror.
[02:51:21.600 --> 02:51:28.600]  So it's all about feeding on the innocence. Here's the archetype in your face from Hollywood.
[02:51:51.600 --> 02:51:54.600]  Stop! Don't be shy!
[02:51:54.600 --> 02:51:56.600]  Bring the child in.
[02:51:56.600 --> 02:51:58.600]  What is that?
[02:51:58.600 --> 02:51:59.600]  That's the child in.
[02:51:59.600 --> 02:52:03.600]  Sock relerge! Have you no sense of propriety?
[02:52:03.600 --> 02:52:06.600]  Continue sticking.
[02:52:06.600 --> 02:52:13.600]  Be welcome, girlfriend. I'd require your assistance. Isn't it lovely?
[02:52:13.600 --> 02:52:19.600]  They used to guard these crystals, but they tricked them, so now it's faculty who bring them near the crystal.
[02:52:19.600 --> 02:52:24.600]  Look deep into it.
[02:52:24.600 --> 02:52:26.600]  I feel...
[02:52:26.600 --> 02:52:28.600]  This is why they kill babies.
[02:52:28.600 --> 02:52:29.600]  Don't fight.
[02:52:29.600 --> 02:52:30.600]  Let's be alive.
[02:52:30.600 --> 02:52:32.600]  Not to take your organs.
[02:52:32.600 --> 02:52:34.600]  Literally taking their essence.
[02:52:34.600 --> 02:52:38.600]  Your love, your spiritual essence.
[02:52:38.600 --> 02:52:42.600]  Please, I'm still hungry.
[02:52:42.600 --> 02:52:50.600]  Take your berries.
[02:52:50.600 --> 02:52:53.600]  Did you have the electrodes in her?
[02:52:53.600 --> 02:52:55.600]  Electrochemical sucks her soul? Energy?
[02:52:55.600 --> 02:52:57.600]  You've done it!
[02:52:57.600 --> 02:52:58.600]  Wait!
[02:52:58.600 --> 02:53:02.600]  Behold!
[02:53:02.600 --> 02:53:06.600]  Stamper's night of the podestus.
[02:53:06.600 --> 02:53:12.600]  Now that dungeon he brags about.
[02:53:12.600 --> 02:53:16.600]  Oh, such a liberal.
[02:53:16.600 --> 02:53:18.600]  Take care about you so much.
[02:53:18.600 --> 02:53:22.600]  That's how we think. Here is life everlasting!
[02:53:22.600 --> 02:53:27.600]  But at least you're keeping her comfortable.
[02:53:27.600 --> 02:53:30.600]  Never in Virginia.
[02:53:30.600 --> 02:53:35.600]  Final essence. The last drop her soul.
[02:53:35.600 --> 02:53:42.600]  Essence. Now that's the true life force.
[02:53:42.600 --> 02:53:43.600]  Oh!
[02:53:43.600 --> 02:53:45.600]  Extremus your scientist.
[02:53:45.600 --> 02:53:48.600]  I have drained the Gavling's essence.
[02:53:48.600 --> 02:53:51.600]  This is the solution to our problem.
[02:53:51.600 --> 02:53:53.600]  A new source of life.
[02:53:53.600 --> 02:53:56.600]  Here, my emperor, for you.
[02:53:56.600 --> 02:53:59.600]  Drink. You must drink.
[02:53:59.600 --> 02:54:17.600]  How do you feel, Sire?
[02:54:17.600 --> 02:54:23.600]  I feel. I feel.
[02:54:23.600 --> 02:54:31.600]  My heart is broken.
[02:54:31.600 --> 02:54:37.600]  Give it to me.
[02:54:37.600 --> 02:54:41.600]  Don't push. Don't push me.
[02:54:41.600 --> 02:54:43.600]  You're trying to get America back.
[02:54:43.600 --> 02:54:46.600]  The beast. Music. Brewery.
[02:54:46.600 --> 02:54:48.600]  Power structure is upset.
[02:54:48.600 --> 02:54:55.600]  Skeksis, conquer death.
[02:54:55.600 --> 02:55:01.600]  I'm not going to have time to get to the whole earlier piece.
[02:55:01.600 --> 02:55:03.600]  Where Gregory Sprex is down.
[02:55:03.600 --> 02:55:06.600]  Post it in forward.com. We will add it.
[02:55:06.600 --> 02:55:08.600]  And again, they catch the gulfing and say,
[02:55:08.600 --> 02:55:10.600]  oh, no one will ever believe him when he escapes.
[02:55:10.600 --> 02:55:12.600]  He goes and tries to warn people and no one believes him, of course.
[02:55:12.600 --> 02:55:15.600]  Oh, no way. The good guardians, the crystals, the Skeksis.
[02:55:15.600 --> 02:55:17.600]  There's no way they're doing anything bad.
[02:55:17.600 --> 02:55:19.600]  I don't believe the crystals, even though they didn't,
[02:55:19.600 --> 02:55:21.600]  no one knows where it came from.
[02:55:21.600 --> 02:55:23.600]  But now the guardians, people have forgotten.
[02:55:23.600 --> 02:55:25.600]  Just don't let your kids get close to the castle.
[02:55:25.600 --> 02:55:28.600]  Now, let's go out to break here with part of Gregory's report
[02:55:28.600 --> 02:55:31.600]  that YouTube took down for discrimination.
[02:55:31.600 --> 02:55:33.600]  Discrimination against Satanists.
[02:55:33.600 --> 02:55:35.600]  I'm not kidding. Here it is.
[02:55:35.600 --> 02:55:37.600]  Adrenochrome.
[02:55:37.600 --> 02:55:40.600]  Adrenochrome? Hmm.
[02:55:40.600 --> 02:55:45.600]  Adrenochrome first hit pop culture in 1971,
[02:55:45.600 --> 02:55:48.600]  when Gonzo journalist Hunter S. Thompson
[02:55:48.600 --> 02:55:52.600]  wrote about it in his book, Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas.
[02:55:52.600 --> 02:55:56.600]  He wrote that his lawyer, Oscar Acosta,
[02:55:56.600 --> 02:56:01.600]  was defending a Satanist who was charged with molesting a child.
[02:56:01.600 --> 02:56:06.600]  The Satanist client paid his lawyer with Adrenochrome
[02:56:06.600 --> 02:56:10.600]  and claimed the only source was the adrenaline glands
[02:56:10.600 --> 02:56:14.600]  from a living human body.
[02:56:14.600 --> 02:56:17.600]  If you search Google for Adrenochrome,
[02:56:17.600 --> 02:56:21.600]  the Google-supported result is from the conspiracy wiki,
[02:56:21.600 --> 02:56:26.600]  which suggests that it is all merely fantasy.
[02:56:26.600 --> 02:56:31.600]  But just to the right, you will find that Adrenochrome is real.
[02:56:31.600 --> 02:56:33.600]  According to scientific research,
[02:56:33.600 --> 02:56:40.600]  Adrenochrome is formed by the oxidation of its precursor, adrenaline.
[02:56:40.600 --> 02:56:44.600]  Adrenaline is the active hormone from the adrenal medulla,
[02:56:44.600 --> 02:56:48.600]  otherwise known as epinephrine.
[02:56:48.600 --> 02:56:53.600]  Epi-pens are auto-injectors that contain synthetic adrenaline.
[02:56:53.600 --> 02:56:55.600]  All right, folks, we're going to break.
[02:56:55.600 --> 02:56:58.600]  Again, in post, I'll add all this and I'll add the part
[02:56:58.600 --> 02:57:00.600]  where they're saying no one will believe the gelfling.
[02:57:00.600 --> 02:57:02.600]  We're going to go to break. We're going to come back.
[02:57:02.600 --> 02:57:04.600]  There is an upper class of Morlocks.
[02:57:04.600 --> 02:57:05.600]  We are the Eloise.
[02:57:05.600 --> 02:57:07.600]  HD Wells told everybody in his fiction book,
[02:57:07.600 --> 02:57:11.600]  wrote a nonfiction explaining, oh, this is really how the world works.
[02:57:11.600 --> 02:57:15.600]  And so it's all just a repeat of that same archetype over and over again.
[02:57:15.600 --> 02:57:19.600]  Remember, they want to shut us down so we can't warn the other gelflings,
[02:57:19.600 --> 02:57:20.600]  the other Eloise.
[02:57:20.600 --> 02:57:23.600]  We are warning everyone we will win together.
[02:57:23.600 --> 02:57:25.600]  But remember, we've got big specials that are about to end.
[02:57:25.600 --> 02:57:28.600]  A free bottle of carnivore digestive enzyme
[02:57:28.600 --> 02:57:30.600]  that's such an amazing next-level probiotic.
[02:57:30.600 --> 02:57:33.600]  When you get DNA force plus for 50% off,
[02:57:33.600 --> 02:57:34.600]  now that's a hell of a deal,
[02:57:34.600 --> 02:57:36.600]  and your funding makes this all possible.
[02:57:36.600 --> 02:57:38.600]  For yourself, for the show, for the planet,
[02:57:38.600 --> 02:58:07.600]  visit infowarstore.com, hour number four is right here.
[02:58:08.600 --> 02:58:17.600]  All your listeners who haven't tried them, I just want to say why not.
[02:58:17.600 --> 02:58:18.600]  Well, you're right.
[02:58:18.600 --> 02:58:20.600]  And all of these things are known to be incredible,
[02:58:20.600 --> 02:58:23.600]  whether it's turmeric, or whether it's the fish oil or the krill oil,
[02:58:23.600 --> 02:58:27.600]  or whether it's the DNA force with the CoQ10 and BioPQQ and all the rest of it.
[02:58:27.600 --> 02:58:29.600]  All of these are things that are like rocket fuel on the body.
[02:58:29.600 --> 02:58:32.600]  You take these bases together, then you have your foundation.
[02:58:32.600 --> 02:58:34.600]  Now you can build the big, strong temple.
[02:58:34.600 --> 02:58:37.600]  With these products I take, when I religiously remember to take them,
[02:58:37.600 --> 02:58:40.600]  it makes my life so much better, and then it funds the information war,
[02:58:40.600 --> 02:58:41.600]  which is so critical.
[02:58:41.600 --> 02:59:10.600]  Thank you so much. God bless you.
[02:59:11.600 --> 02:59:34.600]  Thank you.
[02:59:34.600 --> 03:00:03.600]  Thank you.
[03:00:03.600 --> 03:00:08.600]  I was watching an NBC News report Sunday,
[03:00:08.600 --> 03:00:17.600]  and it was talking about 66 pounds of pure fentanyl was found in Virginia,
[03:00:17.600 --> 03:00:20.600]  and it was enough that you could kill 14 million people.
[03:00:20.600 --> 03:00:25.600]  There were 14 million dosages that would cause an overdose and death.
[03:00:25.600 --> 03:00:27.600]  That's what the doctors said.
[03:00:27.600 --> 03:00:30.600]  But I thought, wow, why is that a big national story?
[03:00:30.600 --> 03:00:33.600]  Let me do a document shot. Thank you.
[03:00:33.600 --> 03:00:38.600]  Why is that a big national story?
[03:00:38.600 --> 03:00:42.600]  Well, because it could kill 14 million people.
[03:00:42.600 --> 03:00:45.600]  That's a pretty big deal, isn't it?
[03:00:45.600 --> 03:00:50.600]  Then I thought about this story that got almost no news from the week before
[03:00:50.600 --> 03:00:56.600]  where the Mexican Navy found 50 tons,
[03:00:56.600 --> 03:01:03.600]  or if you double the 25 tons, it'd be 50,000 pounds of fentanyl from China.
[03:01:03.600 --> 03:01:08.600]  So here's your takeaway, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:01:08.600 --> 03:01:17.600]  China was caught trying to ship in to the United States
[03:01:17.600 --> 03:01:29.600]  25,000 tons of fentanyl that the DEA calculates is enough to give
[03:01:29.600 --> 03:01:39.600]  an overdose to 10 billion, 606 million-plus people.
[03:01:39.600 --> 03:01:41.600]  You heard that right.
[03:01:41.600 --> 03:01:46.600]  China was caught last week in the act of trying to ship in
[03:01:46.600 --> 03:01:54.600]  45,000 tons by the Mexican Navy of pure fentanyl
[03:01:54.600 --> 03:02:03.600]  enough to kill everyone on the planet and then kill
[03:02:03.600 --> 03:02:08.600]  another three-plus billion people again.
[03:02:08.600 --> 03:02:15.600]  And you wonder why our country is in so much trouble.
[03:02:15.600 --> 03:02:18.600]  China, in reverse of the opium wars with the British,
[03:02:18.600 --> 03:02:21.600]  shipped in opium to get everybody drugged out under their control
[03:02:21.600 --> 03:02:23.600]  a couple hundred years ago, is doing this to us.
[03:02:23.600 --> 03:02:25.600]  You're executed in China.
[03:02:25.600 --> 03:02:30.600]  If you get caught with any opium,
[03:02:30.600 --> 03:02:35.600]  well, this is 100 times stronger than that or more.
[03:02:35.600 --> 03:02:37.600]  So this is how China is assaulting us.
[03:02:37.600 --> 03:02:40.600]  And the Leptis media attacks Trump, making this a big issue.
[03:02:40.600 --> 03:02:42.600]  This is one of the number one killers in this country.
[03:02:42.600 --> 03:02:44.600]  It's debilitating people. It's incredible.
[03:02:44.600 --> 03:02:46.600]  So we did the math.
[03:02:46.600 --> 03:02:49.600]  Scott and I, Sunday while we were up here,
[03:02:49.600 --> 03:02:56.600]  just shot this on my phone, and here is where we do the math.
[03:02:56.600 --> 03:03:00.600]  I saw a press report with a DEA said 66 pounds of pure fentanyl
[03:03:00.600 --> 03:03:04.600]  captured in Virginia that had been shipped in by China
[03:03:04.600 --> 03:03:05.600]  and was about to be distributed.
[03:03:05.600 --> 03:03:07.600]  It was enough to kill 14 million people.
[03:03:07.600 --> 03:03:11.600]  Well, they just found 25 tons of it being shipped into Mexico
[03:03:11.600 --> 03:03:14.600]  from China for delivery in the U.S.
[03:03:14.600 --> 03:03:18.600]  So I had an idea that, wait a minute, I bet if you calculate that out,
[03:03:18.600 --> 03:03:20.600]  it ends up being enough to kill everybody in America.
[03:03:20.600 --> 03:03:24.600]  While I was wrong, folks, it's enough to kill everybody in the world.
[03:03:24.600 --> 03:03:26.600]  And Scott's better at math than I am.
[03:03:26.600 --> 03:03:27.600]  Scott tells what we're looking at right here.
[03:03:27.600 --> 03:03:31.600]  All right, so if 66 pounds kills 14 million people
[03:03:31.600 --> 03:03:35.600]  and they found 25 tons, that's 50,000 pounds.
[03:03:35.600 --> 03:03:39.600]  50,000 pounds divided by 66 is 757.58.
[03:03:39.600 --> 03:03:44.600]  That means 757.58 times 14 million that the 66 would kill
[03:03:44.600 --> 03:03:48.600]  equals 10.6 billion, 10.6 billion people.
[03:03:48.600 --> 03:03:50.600]  There's only 7.5 billion people on the Earth.
[03:03:50.600 --> 03:03:55.600]  So that's a ghost that will kill someone with an overdose
[03:03:55.600 --> 03:04:00.600]  enough to kill more people than there are on Earth.
[03:04:00.600 --> 03:04:03.600]  Yes, quite a bit more.
[03:04:03.600 --> 03:04:05.600]  That is pretty damn newsworthy.
[03:04:05.600 --> 03:04:08.600]  China caught trying to ship in enough fentanyl
[03:04:08.600 --> 03:04:11.600]  to the United States to kill the entire planet.
[03:04:11.600 --> 03:04:13.600]  Of course, it's going to be sold and doled out to people,
[03:04:13.600 --> 03:04:15.600]  but there'll be undoubted probably hundreds of thousands
[03:04:15.600 --> 03:04:18.600]  and millions of overdoses as we're already seeing.
[03:04:18.600 --> 03:04:20.600]  Amazing information, Scott.
[03:04:20.600 --> 03:04:24.600]  On the flip side of that, that's what the 25 tons is what they found.
[03:04:24.600 --> 03:04:26.600]  That's what they stopped.
[03:04:26.600 --> 03:04:27.600]  That's what they stopped.
[03:04:27.600 --> 03:04:29.600]  How much got through that they haven't stopped?
[03:04:29.600 --> 03:04:31.600]  Jesus, incredible.
[03:04:31.600 --> 03:04:34.600]  All right, in FullWars.com, tomorrow's news today.
[03:04:34.600 --> 03:04:38.600]  That's China's secret weapon attacking the U.S. with fentanyl
[03:04:38.600 --> 03:04:40.600]  hundreds of times stronger than opium,
[03:04:40.600 --> 03:04:43.600]  way stronger than heroin. Incredible.
[03:04:43.600 --> 03:04:45.600]  Ladies and gentlemen, the only way that report gets out
[03:04:45.600 --> 03:04:46.600]  is when you share it.
[03:04:46.600 --> 03:04:47.600]  It'll be posted within an hour.
[03:04:47.600 --> 03:05:12.600]  In FullWars.com, NewsWars.com, and PrismPlanet.com.
[03:05:17.600 --> 03:05:21.600]  Band.video isn't just going to be a home for Alex Jones
[03:05:21.600 --> 03:05:24.600]  or David Knight or Owen Troyer or Paul Watson band videos.
[03:05:24.600 --> 03:05:27.600]  We are building it to be a place where band memes
[03:05:27.600 --> 03:05:30.600]  are able to be posted, and where a growing list
[03:05:30.600 --> 03:05:33.600]  of freedom-loving contributors are able to have a home
[03:05:33.600 --> 03:05:36.600]  free from being shut down, free from being censored,
[03:05:36.600 --> 03:05:40.600]  free from being silenced by big tech, the chai comms,
[03:05:40.600 --> 03:05:42.600]  the Hollywood scum, and the globalist.
[03:05:42.600 --> 03:05:46.600]  Freedom of speech has a home. It's called Band.video.
[03:05:46.600 --> 03:05:49.600]  America and the World is fighting back against tyranny
[03:05:49.600 --> 03:06:18.600]  at Band.video.
[03:06:19.600 --> 03:06:29.600]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are back live broadcasting.
[03:06:29.600 --> 03:06:32.600]  Worldwide, Paul Joseph Watson is about to take over
[03:06:32.600 --> 03:06:33.600]  here in just a moment.
[03:06:33.600 --> 03:06:35.600]  Some of the other stories.
[03:06:35.600 --> 03:06:39.600]  Up on infowars.com by Kellan McBreen, Internet Mox,
[03:06:39.600 --> 03:06:45.600]  Texas man who surrendered AK-47 after mass shooting.
[03:06:45.600 --> 03:06:48.600]  Law enforcement suggested he sell the weapon back
[03:06:48.600 --> 03:06:50.600]  to a gun shop.
[03:06:50.600 --> 03:06:52.600]  Now, look at this article right here.
[03:06:52.600 --> 03:06:54.600]  Just look at that article right there.
[03:06:54.600 --> 03:06:56.600]  What is he saying?
[03:06:56.600 --> 03:06:59.600]  He's saying that gun owners are to blame
[03:06:59.600 --> 03:07:02.600]  for what some other crazy person does.
[03:07:02.600 --> 03:07:04.600]  And again, when somebody runs over somebody with a car,
[03:07:04.600 --> 03:07:05.600]  do we blame the car?
[03:07:05.600 --> 03:07:07.600]  Somebody stabs somebody with a butcher knife?
[03:07:07.600 --> 03:07:09.600]  Do we blame the butcher knife?
[03:07:09.600 --> 03:07:11.600]  No, but this collective guilt idea,
[03:07:11.600 --> 03:07:13.600]  when mass shootings are more common now,
[03:07:13.600 --> 03:07:16.600]  they're still extremely rare as a cause of death.
[03:07:16.600 --> 03:07:19.600]  The fact that they're projecting that onto all of us,
[03:07:19.600 --> 03:07:22.600]  we should be very, very resentful of that.
[03:07:22.600 --> 03:07:26.600]  How dare you blame me for some Antifa scumbag in Ohio
[03:07:26.600 --> 03:07:29.600]  or some Antifa lunatic in Texas?
[03:07:29.600 --> 03:07:31.600]  I mean, this is crazy.
[03:07:31.600 --> 03:07:33.600]  And we had all these knife attacks
[03:07:33.600 --> 03:07:34.600]  and all these stabbing attacks,
[03:07:34.600 --> 03:07:36.600]  another firebombing of an ICE facility
[03:07:36.600 --> 03:07:38.600]  and a black guy shooting nine other black people
[03:07:38.600 --> 03:07:39.600]  in a football game.
[03:07:39.600 --> 03:07:42.600]  No coverage of that because it doesn't fit
[03:07:42.600 --> 03:07:45.600]  with this weird white supremacist narrative
[03:07:45.600 --> 03:07:48.600]  that, again, is meant to create racial division.
[03:07:48.600 --> 03:07:50.600]  Meanwhile, I see these stories
[03:07:50.600 --> 03:07:52.600]  where the woman stabs a little kid in the face
[03:07:52.600 --> 03:07:54.600]  or the guy kills his sister and his niece
[03:07:54.600 --> 03:07:57.600]  and runs around raping and trying to attack the Greenskeeper.
[03:07:57.600 --> 03:08:00.600]  Man bites woman's lips saying he's the devil,
[03:08:00.600 --> 03:08:03.600]  leaves her with life-changing injuries,
[03:08:03.600 --> 03:08:04.600]  bit off part of her face.
[03:08:04.600 --> 03:08:06.600]  That was in the UK.
[03:08:06.600 --> 03:08:10.600]  Attacker bites off woman's lip at Notting Hill Carnival
[03:08:10.600 --> 03:08:12.600]  for no reason.
[03:08:12.600 --> 03:08:14.600]  Meanwhile, nobody cares about the Communist Chinese,
[03:08:14.600 --> 03:08:16.600]  and forced labor camps, and death camps,
[03:08:16.600 --> 03:08:17.600]  and babies being kept alive
[03:08:17.600 --> 03:08:19.600]  and their organs sold here in America.
[03:08:19.600 --> 03:08:21.600]  It's only when they tell you to care.
[03:08:21.600 --> 03:08:23.600]  Are you supposed to care?
[03:08:23.600 --> 03:08:24.600]  But as I reported earlier,
[03:08:24.600 --> 03:08:27.600]  enough fentanyl caught being tried to be shipped to the US
[03:08:27.600 --> 03:08:30.600]  to kill 10 billion, 600-plus million people.
[03:08:30.600 --> 03:08:33.600]  That's more people than there are on the planet.
[03:08:33.600 --> 03:08:35.600]  Oh, but Trump's wrong to care about that.
[03:08:35.600 --> 03:08:38.600]  Are people more scared of fentanyl or shark attacks?
[03:08:38.600 --> 03:08:40.600]  Because your instincts are scared of a big monster with teeth.
[03:08:40.600 --> 03:08:42.600]  I get it.
[03:08:42.600 --> 03:08:44.600]  Sharks might kill 50 people a year.
[03:08:44.600 --> 03:08:47.600]  Great whites, maybe tens, the average.
[03:08:47.600 --> 03:08:49.600]  50 shark deaths a year.
[03:08:49.600 --> 03:08:51.600]  But everybody's scared,
[03:08:51.600 --> 03:08:53.600]  because they tell you to be scared.
[03:08:53.600 --> 03:08:54.600]  And you all saw Jaws.
[03:08:54.600 --> 03:08:59.600]  And so the media's done, done, done, done, done, done, done, done, done, done, done, done, done.
[03:08:59.600 --> 03:09:01.600]  And everything else gets swept from the rug.
[03:09:01.600 --> 03:09:03.600]  Paul Joseph Watson's going to cover so much here today,
[03:09:03.600 --> 03:09:05.600]  how they're going up for Dave Chappelle,
[03:09:05.600 --> 03:09:07.600]  because he said, you know, I tell you,
[03:09:07.600 --> 03:09:09.600]  it's scary that people that tell you,
[03:09:09.600 --> 03:09:10.600]  you don't have any free speech,
[03:09:10.600 --> 03:09:12.600]  they'll go back and look at everything you ever said,
[03:09:12.600 --> 03:09:13.600]  ready to get you fired.
[03:09:13.600 --> 03:09:15.600]  So Rotten Tomatoes gave them a zero.
[03:09:15.600 --> 03:09:17.600]  That's all coming up today as well.
[03:09:17.600 --> 03:09:20.600]  And don't forget, we've launched with myself and David Knight.
[03:09:20.600 --> 03:09:22.600]  Paul Watson's videos are up there.
[03:09:22.600 --> 03:09:24.600]  Oh, it's Royer Band.Video.
[03:09:24.600 --> 03:09:27.600]  We're going to be adding new contributors and a lot of other folks to it.
[03:09:27.600 --> 03:09:30.600]  It works really good on all devices, Band.Video.
[03:09:30.600 --> 03:09:33.600]  And separately, please remember, ladies and gentlemen,
[03:09:33.600 --> 03:09:37.600]  that we're running a huge special of a free bottle of carnivore,
[03:09:37.600 --> 03:09:40.600]  the amazing enzyme, a $17 value.
[03:09:40.600 --> 03:09:42.600]  It's what it costs us to produce it,
[03:09:42.600 --> 03:09:45.600]  free with a bottle of DNA Force Plus, 50% off,
[03:09:45.600 --> 03:09:46.600]  never had to deal that good.
[03:09:46.600 --> 03:09:49.600]  But we're doing it till carnivore sells out.
[03:09:49.600 --> 03:09:51.600]  I'm going to reorder it for next year.
[03:09:51.600 --> 03:09:53.600]  It's been a great seller, but I want you to try carnivore
[03:09:53.600 --> 03:09:55.600]  for those of you that haven't tried this product,
[03:09:55.600 --> 03:09:58.600]  because it goes great with our fluorolife, great probiotic,
[03:09:58.600 --> 03:10:01.600]  and of course, our Michael ZX that goes after the yeast,
[03:10:01.600 --> 03:10:03.600]  the mold, the candida, the missing link and all that.
[03:10:03.600 --> 03:10:05.600]  So for great gut health, the trifecta there,
[03:10:05.600 --> 03:10:07.600]  but DNA Force is just amazing.
[03:10:07.600 --> 03:10:09.600]  98% reviews for that.
[03:10:09.600 --> 03:10:12.600]  Find out why it's just the flagship cleaning out your cells,
[03:10:12.600 --> 03:10:15.600]  the base for everything we've got at infowarstore.com.
[03:10:15.600 --> 03:10:19.600]  Now, Paul Joseph Watson for the next 50 minutes,
[03:10:19.600 --> 03:10:21.600]  takes over from his studios in London, England.
[03:10:21.600 --> 03:10:25.600]  Paul Joseph Watson of Summit.News.
[03:10:25.600 --> 03:10:26.600]  Thanks, Alex.
[03:10:26.600 --> 03:10:29.600]  Yeah, we have the top story up on Summit.News right now.
[03:10:29.600 --> 03:10:31.600]  Dave Chappelle's politically incorrect comedy special,
[03:10:31.600 --> 03:10:36.600]  hated by woke critics, loved by ordinary Americans.
[03:10:36.600 --> 03:10:39.600]  Again, this illustrates that culture is politics,
[03:10:39.600 --> 03:10:41.600]  or is downstream from culture.
[03:10:41.600 --> 03:10:45.600]  The woke left is so paranoid about socially reengineering society,
[03:10:45.600 --> 03:10:48.600]  and they're so desperate to maintain that grip,
[03:10:48.600 --> 03:10:52.600]  that anyone, any entertainer, any celebrity who dares stray
[03:10:52.600 --> 03:10:55.600]  outside the prison of acceptable thought and opinion,
[03:10:55.600 --> 03:10:59.600]  is immediately bashed, defamed, shamed,
[03:10:59.600 --> 03:11:01.600]  de-platformed, and they're trying to do it once again
[03:11:01.600 --> 03:11:03.600]  with Dave Chappelle.
[03:11:03.600 --> 03:11:05.600]  It's interesting, a few months ago,
[03:11:05.600 --> 03:11:08.600]  I attended a comedy show in London called Comedy Unleashed,
[03:11:08.600 --> 03:11:11.600]  where they have a smattering of people
[03:11:11.600 --> 03:11:14.600]  who are willing to offend their own audience,
[03:11:14.600 --> 03:11:18.600]  which of course is what comedy supposedly used to be all about.
[03:11:18.600 --> 03:11:23.600]  That event has been smeared as a right-wing white supremacist space.
[03:11:23.600 --> 03:11:26.600]  They literally sent, I'm talking about Vice.com.
[03:11:26.600 --> 03:11:29.600]  You can probably pull up the article if you Google my name,
[03:11:29.600 --> 03:11:31.600]  Vice and Comedy Unleashed.
[03:11:31.600 --> 03:11:35.600]  They literally sent somebody to spy on the audience
[03:11:35.600 --> 03:11:38.600]  and to watch my reactions and other people's reactions
[03:11:38.600 --> 03:11:40.600]  who were in the audience
[03:11:40.600 --> 03:11:43.600]  to these edgy, non-politically correct jokes.
[03:11:43.600 --> 03:11:46.600]  Now that's how paranoid they are about anybody
[03:11:46.600 --> 03:11:49.600]  imposing on their total domination
[03:11:49.600 --> 03:11:51.600]  and ring policing of free speech
[03:11:51.600 --> 03:11:54.600]  when it comes to entertainment and comedy.
[03:11:54.600 --> 03:11:57.600]  Dave Chappelle is the latest victim of this.
[03:11:57.600 --> 03:11:59.600]  He's got a new Netflix special out,
[03:11:59.600 --> 03:12:02.600]  in which he goes after cancel culture,
[03:12:02.600 --> 03:12:04.600]  far left activists and the Me Too movement.
[03:12:04.600 --> 03:12:06.600]  As soon as this was released,
[03:12:06.600 --> 03:12:10.600]  Rotten Tomatoes put up a score of 0%
[03:12:10.600 --> 03:12:13.600]  in the reviews for this Netflix special.
[03:12:13.600 --> 03:12:17.600]  Why are the reviews at 0% and now up to 17%,
[03:12:17.600 --> 03:12:20.600]  which includes a bunch of different critic reviews?
[03:12:20.600 --> 03:12:23.600]  Well, it's because they don't allow the general public
[03:12:23.600 --> 03:12:26.600]  the mass audience that is watching this special
[03:12:26.600 --> 03:12:30.600]  to leave any comments or any reviews on their website.
[03:12:30.600 --> 03:12:32.600]  So they've basically got a smattering
[03:12:32.600 --> 03:12:35.600]  of woke, progressive, critics reviews.
[03:12:35.600 --> 03:12:38.600]  Only the authorized peanut gallery
[03:12:38.600 --> 03:12:41.600]  is able to express their opinion about this Netflix special
[03:12:41.600 --> 03:12:43.600]  on Rotten Tomatoes,
[03:12:43.600 --> 03:12:46.600]  and that's why it has a score of just 17%.
[03:12:46.600 --> 03:12:49.600]  Now, what's interesting is you go over to IMDb,
[03:12:49.600 --> 03:12:52.600]  where regular viewers are allowed to post their own reviews,
[03:12:52.600 --> 03:12:57.600]  and the same show that has just 17% on Rotten Tomatoes
[03:12:57.600 --> 03:13:00.600]  has 8.5 out of 10 on IMDb,
[03:13:00.600 --> 03:13:04.600]  because it's not just taking into account the critics reviews,
[03:13:04.600 --> 03:13:06.600]  it's taking into account the general audience,
[03:13:06.600 --> 03:13:08.600]  the general public that is watching it.
[03:13:08.600 --> 03:13:10.600]  And people who've seen the clips of this,
[03:13:10.600 --> 03:13:13.600]  seen the trailer, it's been very well received.
[03:13:13.600 --> 03:13:17.600]  But again, this illustrates just the gigantic gulf
[03:13:17.600 --> 03:13:20.600]  in this culture war between the woke, progressive left,
[03:13:20.600 --> 03:13:22.600]  which runs the entertainment industry,
[03:13:22.600 --> 03:13:24.600]  and the general public.
[03:13:24.600 --> 03:13:27.600]  They are now using reviews of movies,
[03:13:27.600 --> 03:13:30.600]  reviews of comedy specials, reviews of books,
[03:13:30.600 --> 03:13:32.600]  as weapons in the culture war
[03:13:32.600 --> 03:13:34.600]  to try and sing any dissident thought
[03:13:34.600 --> 03:13:37.600]  before it's even allowed to circulate,
[03:13:37.600 --> 03:13:38.600]  which is interesting, actually,
[03:13:38.600 --> 03:13:39.600]  because it relates to another story,
[03:13:39.600 --> 03:13:41.600]  which I'm going to get into later,
[03:13:41.600 --> 03:13:45.600]  about how the Pentagon is literally developing a software system
[03:13:45.600 --> 03:13:48.600]  to stop the spread of viral internet content,
[03:13:48.600 --> 03:13:51.600]  woke, progressive reviewers in the entertainment industry
[03:13:51.600 --> 03:13:52.600]  are trying to do the same thing
[03:13:52.600 --> 03:13:56.600]  by sabotaging these kind of daring comedy specials,
[03:13:56.600 --> 03:14:00.600]  these daring movies that dare challenge the consensus
[03:14:00.600 --> 03:14:02.600]  by panning them right out of the gate
[03:14:02.600 --> 03:14:04.600]  and not allowing the general public
[03:14:04.600 --> 03:14:07.600]  to express their opinion.
[03:14:07.600 --> 03:14:11.600]  Now, Vox made a point of saying that this show,
[03:14:11.600 --> 03:14:12.600]  Dave Chappelle's new show,
[03:14:12.600 --> 03:14:14.600]  which is called Sticks and Stones,
[03:14:14.600 --> 03:14:18.600]  quote, makes a point of punching down,
[03:14:18.600 --> 03:14:22.600]  while the Daily Beast says his jokes are problematic.
[03:14:22.600 --> 03:14:24.600]  But as I point out in this article,
[03:14:24.600 --> 03:14:27.600]  by cracking politically incorrect jokes,
[03:14:27.600 --> 03:14:30.600]  Chappelle isn't punching down, he's punching up.
[03:14:30.600 --> 03:14:32.600]  These people run society.
[03:14:32.600 --> 03:14:34.600]  They're trying to re-engineer society.
[03:14:34.600 --> 03:14:37.600]  They're trying to determine who's allowed to have free speech,
[03:14:37.600 --> 03:14:39.600]  who's allowed to express what opinions.
[03:14:39.600 --> 03:14:42.600]  They are the cultural institutions that run society.
[03:14:42.600 --> 03:14:45.600]  Attacking them is always punching up.
[03:14:45.600 --> 03:14:48.600]  Not that it even matters, it's comedy.
[03:14:48.600 --> 03:14:49.600]  You can joke about anything.
[03:14:49.600 --> 03:14:52.600]  Joking about something doesn't mean you're endorsing it.
[03:14:52.600 --> 03:14:55.600]  Joking about rape doesn't mean you endorse rape.
[03:14:55.600 --> 03:14:57.600]  It's comedy. It's free speech.
[03:14:57.600 --> 03:14:58.600]  You don't have to watch it.
[03:14:58.600 --> 03:15:01.600]  Turn it off if you don't want to watch it.
[03:15:01.600 --> 03:15:04.600]  I go on to say the woke left,
[03:15:04.600 --> 03:15:06.600]  which controls the entertainment industry,
[03:15:06.600 --> 03:15:08.600]  uses minority groups as human shields
[03:15:08.600 --> 03:15:10.600]  to denigrate, silence, and shame anyone
[03:15:10.600 --> 03:15:14.600]  who dares challenge their onerous draconian attempt
[03:15:14.600 --> 03:15:17.600]  to police speech and restrict language
[03:15:17.600 --> 03:15:19.600]  by making fun of the sacred counts
[03:15:19.600 --> 03:15:22.600]  progressives used to socially engineer society.
[03:15:22.600 --> 03:15:25.600]  Chappelle is directly targeting hysterical hate mobs
[03:15:25.600 --> 03:15:27.600]  backed by corporate power.
[03:15:27.600 --> 03:15:29.600]  We're trying to take over culture
[03:15:29.600 --> 03:15:33.600]  and turn comedy into a bland, sanitized forefest.
[03:15:33.600 --> 03:15:35.600]  And they're so obsessed with that control,
[03:15:35.600 --> 03:15:38.600]  they're not even allowing the regular punters,
[03:15:38.600 --> 03:15:41.600]  the audience, to have a say on this new comedy special
[03:15:41.600 --> 03:15:45.600]  because it would prove that it's loved by the masses,
[03:15:45.600 --> 03:15:47.600]  hated by the control freaks.
[03:15:47.600 --> 03:15:49.600]  This is the Alex Jones Show Live.
[03:15:49.600 --> 03:16:11.600]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.
[03:16:11.600 --> 03:16:21.600]  I'm Dan Pilla.
[03:16:41.600 --> 03:16:45.600]  Who do we fight for? The Deep State began with World War I,

[03:16:51.600 --> 03:16:53.600]  When you have a pain in the neck,
[03:16:53.600 --> 03:16:57.600]  a real pain in the neck, back, shoulder, or legs,
[03:16:57.600 --> 03:17:00.600]  you now have two convenient choices to get fast relief
[03:17:00.600 --> 03:17:02.600]  without taking another pill

[03:17:52.600 --> 03:17:54.600]  Josh in Washington, you're on the air, go ahead.
[03:17:54.600 --> 03:17:56.600]  Alex, God bless you. I have an idea
[03:17:56.600 --> 03:17:58.600]  for a new InfoWars t-shirt instead of,
[03:17:58.600 --> 03:18:01.600]  this is your brain, this is your brain on drugs,
[03:18:01.600 --> 03:18:04.600]  this is your brain, this is your brain on 5G.
[03:18:04.600 --> 03:18:06.600]  Showing your brain, getting fried.
[03:18:06.600 --> 03:18:08.600]  Then I have some comments on your supplements, man.
[03:18:08.600 --> 03:18:10.600]  Totally changed my life. I use Turboforce,
[03:18:10.600 --> 03:18:12.600]  bodies, Albu power, Brain Force,
[03:18:12.600 --> 03:18:15.600]  Fish Oil, Ultra-12, Daily, X2 every several days.
[03:18:15.600 --> 03:18:18.600]  Now, what I've found is really combining them
[03:18:18.600 --> 03:18:21.600]  is totally synergistic and transcendent feeling
[03:18:21.600 --> 03:18:23.600]  that I get by combining all your products
[03:18:23.600 --> 03:18:25.600]  and I just want to urge all your listeners who haven't tried them,
[03:18:25.600 --> 03:18:27.600]  I just want to say why not.
[03:18:27.600 --> 03:18:29.600]  Well, you're right that all of these things are known
[03:18:29.600 --> 03:18:31.600]  to be incredible, whether it's turmeric
[03:18:31.600 --> 03:18:33.600]  or whether it's the fish oil or the krill oil
[03:18:33.600 --> 03:18:35.600]  or whether it's the DNA force with the CoQ10
[03:18:35.600 --> 03:18:37.600]  and BioPQQ and all the rest of it.
[03:18:37.600 --> 03:18:39.600]  All of these are things that are like rocket fuel on the body.
[03:18:39.600 --> 03:18:41.600]  You take these bases together,
[03:18:41.600 --> 03:18:43.600]  then you have your foundation,
[03:18:43.600 --> 03:18:45.600]  now you can build the big strong temple.
[03:18:45.600 --> 03:18:47.600]  With these products I take,
[03:18:47.600 --> 03:18:49.600]  when I religiously remember to take them,
[03:18:49.600 --> 03:18:51.600]  it makes my life so much better and then it funds
[03:18:51.600 --> 03:18:53.600]  the Information War, which is so critical.
[03:18:53.600 --> 03:18:55.600]  Thank you so much, God bless you.
[03:18:55.600 --> 03:18:58.600]  SuperMell Vitality is already in the top three
[03:18:58.600 --> 03:19:01.600]  of our best sellers for the six years we've had it.
[03:19:01.600 --> 03:19:03.600]  Stamina produced in Utah
[03:19:03.600 --> 03:19:05.600]  by one of the top herbal companies in the nation
[03:19:05.600 --> 03:19:07.600]  that we've been private labeling.
[03:19:07.600 --> 03:19:09.600]  It is cold pressed.
[03:19:09.600 --> 03:19:11.600]  It takes at least three times the herbs
[03:19:11.600 --> 03:19:13.600]  that are wild-crafted and organic
[03:19:13.600 --> 03:19:15.600]  to be able to produce this.
[03:19:15.600 --> 03:19:17.600]  It's not boiled, it's not heated, it's never been dried.
[03:19:17.600 --> 03:19:19.600]  It's taken from fresh herbs.
[03:19:19.600 --> 03:19:21.600]  That's why it's so strong.
[03:19:21.600 --> 03:19:23.600]  That's why it's so effective for libido,
[03:19:23.600 --> 03:19:25.600]  stamina and energy.
[03:19:25.600 --> 03:19:27.600]  And I'm so excited about SuperMell Vitality
[03:19:27.600 --> 03:19:29.600]  and carnivore vitality
[03:19:29.600 --> 03:19:31.600]  and carnivore 30
[03:19:31.600 --> 03:19:33.600]  that I'm offering you with every order
[03:19:33.600 --> 03:19:35.600]  of SuperMell Vitality

[03:19:37.600 --> 03:19:39.600]  of carnivore digestive enzyme.
[03:19:39.600 --> 03:19:41.600]  We're going to sell out of this very quickly,
[03:19:41.600 --> 03:19:43.600]  but it's an offer so that you experience
[03:19:43.600 --> 03:19:45.600]  how amazing both these products are.

[03:20:19.600 --> 03:20:21.600]  Ladies and gentlemen,
[03:20:21.600 --> 03:20:23.600]  we're back live.
[03:20:23.600 --> 03:20:25.600]  Paul Watson was talking about the Dave Chappelle thing.
[03:20:25.600 --> 03:20:27.600]  I saw last Friday
[03:20:27.600 --> 03:20:29.600]  when this broke
[03:20:29.600 --> 03:20:31.600]  the actual trailer
[03:20:31.600 --> 03:20:33.600]  that they said made them so mad
[03:20:33.600 --> 03:20:35.600]  he threw in their little inward
[03:20:35.600 --> 03:20:37.600]  founding father thing that wasn't true
[03:20:37.600 --> 03:20:39.600]  where they say, hey inward, go write the Constitution.
[03:20:39.600 --> 03:20:41.600]  When it was Thomas Jefferson that wrote it
[03:20:41.600 --> 03:20:43.600]  or at least the Declaration of Independence
[03:20:43.600 --> 03:20:45.600]  and a lot of the Constitution,
[03:20:45.600 --> 03:20:47.600]  I thought, well that's just him,
[03:20:47.600 --> 03:20:49.600]  their red meat, their race war prerogative.
[03:20:49.600 --> 03:20:51.600]  Then he goes into, well
[03:20:51.600 --> 03:20:53.600]  here's the audio from the trailer
[03:20:53.600 --> 03:20:55.600]  that makes them so mad.
[03:20:55.600 --> 03:20:57.600]  The next one's a little harder.
[03:20:57.600 --> 03:20:59.600]  I want to see if you can guess who it is
[03:20:59.600 --> 03:21:01.600]  I'm doing an impression of.
[03:21:01.600 --> 03:21:03.600]  Alright, let me get into the character.
[03:21:03.600 --> 03:21:05.600]  You gotta guess who it is though.
[03:21:05.600 --> 03:21:07.600]  Okay, here it goes.
[03:21:07.600 --> 03:21:09.600]  If you do anything wrong
[03:21:09.600 --> 03:21:11.600]  in your life, and I find out about it
[03:21:11.600 --> 03:21:13.600]  I'm going to try and take everything away from you.
[03:21:13.600 --> 03:21:15.600]  And I don't care what I find out.
[03:21:15.600 --> 03:21:17.600]  It'll be today, tomorrow, 15, 20 years from now.
[03:21:17.600 --> 03:21:19.600]  If I find out
[03:21:19.600 --> 03:21:21.600]  you're fucking the finished.
[03:21:23.600 --> 03:21:25.600]  Who's that?
[03:21:25.600 --> 03:21:27.600]  That's you.
[03:21:29.600 --> 03:21:31.600]  That's what the audience sounds like to me.
[03:21:35.600 --> 03:21:37.600]  That's why I don't be coming out
[03:21:37.600 --> 03:21:39.600]  doing comedy all the time
[03:21:39.600 --> 03:21:41.600]  to the Omegas, and it's the worst motherfuckers
[03:21:41.600 --> 03:21:43.600]  I've ever tried to entertain
[03:21:43.600 --> 03:21:45.600]  in my fucking life.
[03:21:45.600 --> 03:21:47.600]  And I stopped right there
[03:21:47.600 --> 03:21:49.600]  because the trailer I saw had the cuss words
[03:21:49.600 --> 03:21:51.600]  bleeped out, but that's the one we found real quick during the break.
[03:21:51.600 --> 03:21:53.600]  The reason I play that is
[03:21:53.600 --> 03:21:55.600]  he says there are these people
[03:21:55.600 --> 03:21:57.600]  ruining comedy that police everybody's
[03:21:57.600 --> 03:21:59.600]  speech and try to ruin their lives
[03:21:59.600 --> 03:22:01.600]  and you're effing ruining the world
[03:22:01.600 --> 03:22:03.600]  for radio stations to be able to lay some of that obviously.
[03:22:03.600 --> 03:22:05.600]  There you see it
[03:22:05.600 --> 03:22:07.600]  ladies and gentlemen.
[03:22:07.600 --> 03:22:09.600]  And then now he gets a zero on Rotten Tomatoes
[03:22:09.600 --> 03:22:11.600]  and they're all calling for his head
[03:22:11.600 --> 03:22:13.600]  like supremacist. It shows it's a cult
[03:22:13.600 --> 03:22:15.600]  of raw power
[03:22:15.600 --> 03:22:17.600]  wanting to dominate what everybody says and does.
[03:22:17.600 --> 03:22:19.600]  See it all at summit.news
[03:22:19.600 --> 03:22:21.600]  and infowars.com.
[03:22:21.600 --> 03:22:23.600]  Thanks Alex.
[03:22:23.600 --> 03:22:25.600]  Yeah, in the rest of the special
[03:22:25.600 --> 03:22:27.600]  and this was covered by a bunch of outlets
[03:22:27.600 --> 03:22:29.600]  he attacks Jussie Smollett
[03:22:29.600 --> 03:22:31.600]  which obviously they weren't happy about.
[03:22:31.600 --> 03:22:33.600]  He attacks the hashtag me too movement.
[03:22:33.600 --> 03:22:35.600]  He also attacks the
[03:22:35.600 --> 03:22:37.600]  alphabet people, the LGBT
[03:22:37.600 --> 03:22:39.600]  lobby so they weren't happy about that.
[03:22:39.600 --> 03:22:41.600]  And this is completely insidious.
[03:22:41.600 --> 03:22:43.600]  This is all about controlling
[03:22:43.600 --> 03:22:45.600]  culture. This is the same process
[03:22:45.600 --> 03:22:47.600]  we see in art,
[03:22:47.600 --> 03:22:49.600]  movies, literature.
[03:22:49.600 --> 03:22:51.600]  If you know as an upcoming artist
[03:22:51.600 --> 03:22:53.600]  that you're going to offend the
[03:22:53.600 --> 03:22:55.600]  critics who are going to give your
[03:22:55.600 --> 03:22:57.600]  TV show movie book whatever 0%
[03:22:57.600 --> 03:22:59.600]  as soon as it gets off the ground
[03:22:59.600 --> 03:23:01.600]  what are you going to do? You're going to self-censor.
[03:23:01.600 --> 03:23:03.600]  There are people who have already made it
[03:23:03.600 --> 03:23:05.600]  people like Dave Chappelle
[03:23:05.600 --> 03:23:07.600]  people like Quentin Tarantino
[03:23:07.600 --> 03:23:09.600]  who don't need to cow
[03:23:09.600 --> 03:23:11.600]  to these leftist outrage mods
[03:23:11.600 --> 03:23:13.600]  because they've already had massive success
[03:23:13.600 --> 03:23:15.600]  even still
[03:23:15.600 --> 03:23:17.600]  Quentin Tarantino got some
[03:23:17.600 --> 03:23:19.600]  heat for not giving
[03:23:19.600 --> 03:23:21.600]  women enough dialogue in his most recent
[03:23:21.600 --> 03:23:23.600]  movie once upon a time in Hollywood.
[03:23:23.600 --> 03:23:25.600]  So even the people who established
[03:23:25.600 --> 03:23:27.600]  themselves who are so big that they can't
[03:23:27.600 --> 03:23:29.600]  be dragged down
[03:23:29.600 --> 03:23:31.600]  in this cloud, this red mist
[03:23:31.600 --> 03:23:33.600]  of offensive outrage cancel culture
[03:23:33.600 --> 03:23:35.600]  they still attack them.
[03:23:35.600 --> 03:23:37.600]  The differences they're already established
[03:23:37.600 --> 03:23:39.600]  they can shake it off as Dave Chappelle
[03:23:39.600 --> 03:23:41.600]  would probably shake this off
[03:23:41.600 --> 03:23:43.600]  given that his special has got 8.51
[03:23:43.600 --> 03:23:45.600]  IMDV from the people who actually
[03:23:45.600 --> 03:23:47.600]  watched it because Americans are sick
[03:23:47.600 --> 03:23:49.600]  to death of being lectured
[03:23:49.600 --> 03:23:51.600]  about what they can laugh at
[03:23:51.600 --> 03:23:53.600]  what they're allowed to find humorous
[03:23:53.600 --> 03:23:55.600]  but it's absolutely insidious
[03:23:55.600 --> 03:23:57.600]  that the left thinks they can prevent
[03:23:57.600 --> 03:23:59.600]  people make people self-centre in the
[03:23:59.600 --> 03:24:01.600]  first place by creating this
[03:24:01.600 --> 03:24:03.600]  environment of ring fencing of opinions
[03:24:03.600 --> 03:24:05.600]  and what people are allowed to find
[03:24:05.600 --> 03:24:07.600]  humorous meanwhile replacing it
[03:24:07.600 --> 03:24:09.600]  with all this woke nonsense
[03:24:09.600 --> 03:24:11.600]  that isn't humorous at all.
[03:24:11.600 --> 03:24:13.600]  Meanwhile
[03:24:13.600 --> 03:24:15.600]  the Sun reports
[03:24:15.600 --> 03:24:17.600]  American Airlines
[03:24:17.600 --> 03:24:19.600]  passenger shock
[03:24:19.600 --> 03:24:21.600]  traveler take miniature horse on to fly
[03:24:21.600 --> 03:24:23.600]  that's right some giant land whale
[03:24:23.600 --> 03:24:25.600]  has been pictured on an American Airlines
[03:24:25.600 --> 03:24:27.600]  flight with a miniature
[03:24:27.600 --> 03:24:29.600]  horse.
[03:24:29.600 --> 03:24:31.600]  Havan Nowak said he noticed the animal
[03:24:31.600 --> 03:24:33.600]  by a fellow traveler while flying on a
[03:24:33.600 --> 03:24:35.600]  service from Chicago to Omaha
[03:24:35.600 --> 03:24:37.600]  he posted the footage to Twitter
[03:24:37.600 --> 03:24:39.600]  which showed the horse calmly sitting
[03:24:39.600 --> 03:24:41.600]  near the front of the plane in an ILC
[03:24:41.600 --> 03:24:43.600]  and again
[03:24:43.600 --> 03:24:45.600]  this is the point
[03:24:45.600 --> 03:24:47.600]  the same people
[03:24:47.600 --> 03:24:49.600]  who need emotional support ponies
[03:24:49.600 --> 03:24:51.600]  to travel on airplanes
[03:24:51.600 --> 03:24:53.600]  to get through a basic day in their lives
[03:24:53.600 --> 03:24:55.600]  are also being given the power
[03:24:55.600 --> 03:24:57.600]  to control and socially re-engineer
[03:24:57.600 --> 03:24:59.600]  Western society. These are the people
[03:24:59.600 --> 03:25:01.600]  who are given jobs
[03:25:01.600 --> 03:25:03.600]  in all the top social media companies
[03:25:03.600 --> 03:25:05.600]  these are the people being given roles
[03:25:05.600 --> 03:25:07.600]  on hate and extremism advisory
[03:25:07.600 --> 03:25:09.600]  boards to determine
[03:25:09.600 --> 03:25:11.600]  who and who doesn't have free speech
[03:25:11.600 --> 03:25:13.600]  you see them multiplying everywhere
[03:25:13.600 --> 03:25:15.600]  and they literally have emotional support
[03:25:15.600 --> 03:25:17.600]  ponies on planes because they're that
[03:25:17.600 --> 03:25:19.600]  ridiculously fragile
[03:25:19.600 --> 03:25:21.600]  they can't get through a flight
[03:25:21.600 --> 03:25:23.600]  without having an animal on board
[03:25:23.600 --> 03:25:25.600]  the airplane.
[03:25:25.600 --> 03:25:27.600]  The person who posted the footage said
[03:25:27.600 --> 03:25:29.600]  at this time we would like to begin boarding
[03:25:29.600 --> 03:25:31.600]  with any active duty military families traveling
[03:25:31.600 --> 03:25:33.600]  with children under the age of three
[03:25:33.600 --> 03:25:35.600]  and horses. Another passenger
[03:25:35.600 --> 03:25:37.600]  also spotted the animal checking, tweeting
[03:25:37.600 --> 03:25:39.600]  there was a small horse in line at the airport today
[03:25:39.600 --> 03:25:41.600]  I'm curious about it
[03:25:41.600 --> 03:25:43.600]  it was later revealed to be called flirty
[03:25:43.600 --> 03:25:45.600]  and even had its own Twitter and Instagram account
[03:25:47.600 --> 03:25:49.600]  yes, really
[03:25:49.600 --> 03:25:51.600]  they wrote flirty nights up to the skies yesterday
[03:25:51.600 --> 03:25:53.600]  it was a great experience and I learned a lot
[03:25:53.600 --> 03:25:55.600]  flirty was fantastic and handled it all like a pro
[03:25:55.600 --> 03:25:57.600]  so this
[03:25:57.600 --> 03:25:59.600]  giant land whale literally has to travel
[03:25:59.600 --> 03:26:01.600]  with a horse because she's so fragile
[03:26:01.600 --> 03:26:03.600]  and can't get through a domestic flight
[03:26:03.600 --> 03:26:05.600]  these are the people who are taking over
[03:26:05.600 --> 03:26:07.600]  society, these are the people
[03:26:07.600 --> 03:26:09.600]  being given power
[03:26:09.600 --> 03:26:11.600]  to decide what's offensive
[03:26:11.600 --> 03:26:13.600]  people who literally can't get through a day
[03:26:13.600 --> 03:26:15.600]  without having an emotional
[03:26:15.600 --> 03:26:17.600]  support pony
[03:26:17.600 --> 03:26:19.600]  what could possibly go wrong
[03:26:19.600 --> 03:26:21.600]  meanwhile
[03:26:21.600 --> 03:26:23.600]  Prince Harry urges environments we friendly
[03:26:23.600 --> 03:26:25.600]  travel after taking four private jet
[03:26:25.600 --> 03:26:27.600]  trips in just eleven days
[03:26:27.600 --> 03:26:29.600]  it was we saying not as we do
[03:26:29.600 --> 03:26:31.600]  so once again
[03:26:31.600 --> 03:26:33.600]  because of his idiotic
[03:26:33.600 --> 03:26:35.600]  woke social justice wife
[03:26:35.600 --> 03:26:37.600]  Meghan Markle who is a complete
[03:26:37.600 --> 03:26:39.600]  insult to the royal family
[03:26:39.600 --> 03:26:41.600]  he's lecturing everyone else
[03:26:41.600 --> 03:26:43.600]  about how to live their life environment
[03:26:43.600 --> 03:26:45.600]  in an environmentally friendly way
[03:26:45.600 --> 03:26:47.600]  encouraging environmentally friendly travel
[03:26:47.600 --> 03:26:49.600]  after he personally took
[03:26:49.600 --> 03:26:51.600]  four private jet trips in the space
[03:26:51.600 --> 03:26:53.600]  of just eleven days
[03:26:53.600 --> 03:26:55.600]  during the event in Amsterdam which was
[03:26:55.600 --> 03:26:57.600]  backed by giant corporations
[03:26:57.600 --> 03:26:59.600]  who were responsible for actually omitting the
[03:26:59.600 --> 03:27:01.600]  amount of CO2 as per usual
[03:27:01.600 --> 03:27:03.600]  he said we can all do better
[03:27:03.600 --> 03:27:05.600]  and while no one is perfect we all have a
[03:27:05.600 --> 03:27:07.600]  responsibility for our own individual impact
[03:27:07.600 --> 03:27:09.600]  he doesn't really seem to be
[03:27:09.600 --> 03:27:11.600]  that concerned about his own individual
[03:27:11.600 --> 03:27:13.600]  impact because
[03:27:13.600 --> 03:27:15.600]  last month him and his wife
[03:27:15.600 --> 03:27:17.600]  took four private jet trips in eleven days
[03:27:17.600 --> 03:27:19.600]  generating an estimated
[03:27:19.600 --> 03:27:21.600]  seven times the emissions
[03:27:21.600 --> 03:27:23.600]  per person compared to a commercial
[03:27:23.600 --> 03:27:25.600]  flight when flying home from Nice
[03:27:25.600 --> 03:27:27.600]  after visiting Elton John's 18 million
[03:27:27.600 --> 03:27:29.600]  dollar mansion
[03:27:29.600 --> 03:27:31.600]  but it's okay because they buy
[03:27:31.600 --> 03:27:33.600]  carbon offset subsidies which are then
[03:27:33.600 --> 03:27:35.600]  fed into all the little
[03:27:35.600 --> 03:27:37.600]  global corporations controlled by
[03:27:37.600 --> 03:27:39.600]  Rothschild and Rockefeller
[03:27:39.600 --> 03:27:41.600]  who run the entire scam
[03:27:41.600 --> 03:27:43.600]  meanwhile people who are struggling
[03:27:43.600 --> 03:27:45.600]  paycheck to paycheck are increasingly
[03:27:45.600 --> 03:27:47.600]  being hit with hidden taxes
[03:27:47.600 --> 03:27:49.600]  for carbon dioxide emissions
[03:27:49.600 --> 03:27:51.600]  but don't worry because Prince Harry
[03:27:51.600 --> 03:27:53.600]  is contributing to the very same fund
[03:27:53.600 --> 03:27:55.600]  that he will eventually benefit from
[03:27:55.600 --> 03:27:57.600]  before the trip
[03:27:57.600 --> 03:27:59.600]  to Elton John's 18 million dollar mansion
[03:27:59.600 --> 03:28:01.600]  which I'm sure was very urgent
[03:28:01.600 --> 03:28:03.600]  and crucial
[03:28:03.600 --> 03:28:05.600]  they travelled by private jet with Beether
[03:28:05.600 --> 03:28:07.600]  generating 12.5 tons
[03:28:07.600 --> 03:28:09.600]  of carbon dioxide per person
[03:28:09.600 --> 03:28:11.600]  the amount of pollution that would take 14 commercial
[03:28:11.600 --> 03:28:13.600]  flights to emit
[03:28:13.600 --> 03:28:15.600]  Prince Harry also attended a google
[03:28:15.600 --> 03:28:17.600]  guys event in Italy to discuss global warming
[03:28:17.600 --> 03:28:19.600]  which by the way
[03:28:19.600 --> 03:28:21.600]  dozens of celebrities flew
[03:28:21.600 --> 03:28:23.600]  from Los Angeles to Italy
[03:28:23.600 --> 03:28:25.600]  spewing again
[03:28:25.600 --> 03:28:27.600]  thousands of tons of carbon dioxide
[03:28:27.600 --> 03:28:29.600]  to lecture you on driving a car
[03:28:29.600 --> 03:28:31.600]  to lecture you on taking too many
[03:28:31.600 --> 03:28:33.600]  baths to lecture you on having

[03:28:37.600 --> 03:28:39.600]  by claiming he had spent

[03:28:41.600 --> 03:28:43.600]  by commercial adubius

[03:32:13.600 --> 03:32:15.600]  to block the signal and it's now here

[03:33:37.600 --> 03:33:39.600]  in the 2016 election they did studies
[03:33:39.600 --> 03:33:41.600]  which found that the most effective
[03:33:41.600 --> 03:33:43.600]  memes came from the Donald
[03:33:43.600 --> 03:33:45.600]  and fortune that's why they're targeting them

[03:35:45.600 --> 03:35:47.600]  today
[03:35:47.600 --> 03:35:49.600]  as the story up on summit news headline
[03:35:49.600 --> 03:35:51.600]  penzigo launches new program to fight viral
[03:35:51.600 --> 03:35:53.600]  internet content
[03:35:53.600 --> 03:35:55.600]  DARPA declares war on
[03:35:55.600 --> 03:35:57.600]  memes
[03:35:57.600 --> 03:35:59.600]  now we've focused on the studies
[03:35:59.600 --> 03:36:01.600]  before there was one out of
[03:36:01.600 --> 03:36:03.600]  University of College London
[03:36:03.600 --> 03:36:05.600]  which found that the most effective memes
[03:36:05.600 --> 03:36:07.600]  for 2016 presidential election
[03:36:07.600 --> 03:36:09.600]  largely originated in two places
[03:36:09.600 --> 03:36:11.600]  the donald subreddit
[03:36:11.600 --> 03:36:13.600]  of course a couple of months ago
[03:36:13.600 --> 03:36:15.600]  got quarantined and locked down
[03:36:15.600 --> 03:36:17.600]  limited functions
[03:36:17.600 --> 03:36:19.600]  and of course 4chan's poll
[03:36:19.600 --> 03:36:21.600]  which is basically blamed at this point
[03:36:21.600 --> 03:36:23.600]  for every mass shooting that happens
[03:36:23.600 --> 03:36:25.600]  so they found out
[03:36:25.600 --> 03:36:27.600]  that the most effectively spread
[03:36:27.600 --> 03:36:29.600]  memes which helped elect donald trump
[03:36:29.600 --> 03:36:31.600]  came from those two new websites
[03:36:31.600 --> 03:36:33.600]  shot horror facebook
[03:36:33.600 --> 03:36:35.600]  subsequently announced it was developing
[03:36:35.600 --> 03:36:37.600]  new AI algorithms
[03:36:37.600 --> 03:36:39.600]  that can detect and ban
[03:36:39.600 --> 03:36:41.600]  well defensive memes
[03:36:41.600 --> 03:36:43.600]  of course in the EU we had the passage
[03:36:43.600 --> 03:36:45.600]  of a bill that would
[03:36:45.600 --> 03:36:47.600]  potentially ban the upload of memes
[03:36:47.600 --> 03:36:49.600]  by declaring them to be copyright violations
[03:36:49.600 --> 03:36:51.600]  that passed
[03:36:51.600 --> 03:36:53.600]  it hasn't been enforced yet but it could be about to
[03:36:53.600 --> 03:36:55.600]  now we have the defense
[03:36:55.600 --> 03:36:57.600]  advanced research projects agency
[03:36:57.600 --> 03:36:59.600]  DARPA
[03:36:59.600 --> 03:37:01.600]  seeking to create software
[03:37:01.600 --> 03:37:03.600]  with the capability to automatically
[03:37:03.600 --> 03:37:05.600]  detect, attribute and characterize
[03:37:05.600 --> 03:37:07.600]  falsified multimodal
[03:37:07.600 --> 03:37:09.600]  media to defend against large scale
[03:37:09.600 --> 03:37:11.600]  automated disinformation attacks
[03:37:11.600 --> 03:37:13.600]  now what they won't tell you
[03:37:13.600 --> 03:37:15.600]  is that
[03:37:15.600 --> 03:37:17.600]  the largest fake news stories
[03:37:17.600 --> 03:37:19.600]  over the past two decades
[03:37:19.600 --> 03:37:21.600]  have come directly from the mainstream media
[03:37:21.600 --> 03:37:23.600]  but don't worry
[03:37:23.600 --> 03:37:25.600]  because they won't be included
[03:37:25.600 --> 03:37:27.600]  in the targeting in this program
[03:37:27.600 --> 03:37:29.600]  because they are
[03:37:29.600 --> 03:37:31.600]  trusted sources
[03:37:31.600 --> 03:37:33.600]  just like youtube
[03:37:33.600 --> 03:37:35.600]  varies independent content
[03:37:35.600 --> 03:37:37.600]  under a wall a deluge of trusted sources
[03:37:37.600 --> 03:37:39.600]  despite fact those trusted
[03:37:39.600 --> 03:37:41.600]  sources have proven completely untrustworthy
[03:37:41.600 --> 03:37:43.600]  untrustworthy on massive giant
[03:37:43.600 --> 03:37:45.600]  issues politically
[03:37:45.600 --> 03:37:47.600]  over the past two decades including
[03:37:47.600 --> 03:37:49.600]  of course the russian collusion hoax
[03:37:49.600 --> 03:37:51.600]  which never happened
[03:37:51.600 --> 03:37:53.600]  the only areas
[03:37:53.600 --> 03:37:55.600]  targeted will be independent media
[03:37:55.600 --> 03:37:57.600]  it's titled semantic forensics
[03:37:57.600 --> 03:37:59.600]  and the program
[03:37:59.600 --> 03:38:01.600]  will run content through a myriad of algorithms
[03:38:01.600 --> 03:38:03.600]  to identify inconsistency
[03:38:03.600 --> 03:38:05.600]  and identify a story or a meme
[03:38:05.600 --> 03:38:07.600]  as inauthentic or fake
[03:38:07.600 --> 03:38:09.600]  the whole point of memes is that they're satire
[03:38:09.600 --> 03:38:11.600]  not necessarily
[03:38:11.600 --> 03:38:13.600]  factually accurate
[03:38:13.600 --> 03:38:15.600]  they're only trying to ban them because they know
[03:38:15.600 --> 03:38:17.600]  the power that they have
[03:38:17.600 --> 03:38:19.600]  in waking people up and because of course
[03:38:19.600 --> 03:38:21.600]  the left is so petrified
[03:38:21.600 --> 03:38:23.600]  of offending everybody
[03:38:23.600 --> 03:38:25.600]  they're permanently walking on eggshells
[03:38:25.600 --> 03:38:27.600]  that satire and humour anymore
[03:38:27.600 --> 03:38:29.600]  and the left can't meme
[03:38:29.600 --> 03:38:31.600]  so it's easier just to ban memes
[03:38:31.600 --> 03:38:33.600]  and this is basically the effect that this program
[03:38:33.600 --> 03:38:35.600]  will eventually have if it's rolled out
[03:38:35.600 --> 03:38:37.600]  they're doing a test run
[03:38:37.600 --> 03:38:39.600]  of about 5 million news stories
[03:38:39.600 --> 03:38:41.600]  and images
[03:38:41.600 --> 03:38:43.600]  testing these algorithms to see if they can
[03:38:43.600 --> 03:38:45.600]  pick out so called disinformation
[03:38:45.600 --> 03:38:47.600]  of course a completely
[03:38:47.600 --> 03:38:49.600]  vague and subjective term
[03:38:49.600 --> 03:38:51.600]  just like fake news which is going to mean
[03:38:51.600 --> 03:38:53.600]  any narrative that goes against the consensus
[03:38:53.600 --> 03:38:55.600]  given the program doesn't take into account
[03:38:55.600 --> 03:38:57.600]  the fact that so called trusted sources
[03:38:57.600 --> 03:38:59.600]  in the mainstream media have been responsible
[03:38:59.600 --> 03:39:01.600]  for some of the biggest fake news stories
[03:39:01.600 --> 03:39:03.600]  in modern history such as Trump, Russia
[03:39:03.600 --> 03:39:05.600]  election collusion
[03:39:05.600 --> 03:39:07.600]  the software will only succeed in eliminating
[03:39:07.600 --> 03:39:09.600]  dissident narratives
[03:39:09.600 --> 03:39:11.600]  this is what Helen Boyinsky
[03:39:11.600 --> 03:39:13.600]  warned about the true intent
[03:39:13.600 --> 03:39:15.600]  of the program which she claims
[03:39:15.600 --> 03:39:17.600]  is to quote
[03:39:17.600 --> 03:39:19.600]  stamp our dissent
[03:39:19.600 --> 03:39:21.600]  he says to hear them tell it
[03:39:21.600 --> 03:39:23.600]  I'm just wants to even the playing field
[03:39:23.600 --> 03:39:25.600]  and again that's what we hear
[03:39:25.600 --> 03:39:27.600]  with Twitter, with Facebook
[03:39:27.600 --> 03:39:29.600]  if you're resonating more
[03:39:29.600 --> 03:39:31.600]  if you're on YouTube getting millions of views
[03:39:31.600 --> 03:39:33.600]  CNN is getting nothing
[03:39:33.600 --> 03:39:35.600]  MVC is getting nothing
[03:39:35.600 --> 03:39:37.600]  they just want to level the playing field
[03:39:37.600 --> 03:39:39.600]  by artificially boosting those accounts
[03:39:39.600 --> 03:39:41.600]  those so called trusted sources
[03:39:41.600 --> 03:39:43.600]  and they're going to do the same now
[03:39:43.600 --> 03:39:45.600]  apparently when it comes to memes
[03:39:45.600 --> 03:39:47.600]  she continues the fake hunters
[03:39:47.600 --> 03:39:49.600]  pursuing the cause of truth in media
[03:39:49.600 --> 03:39:51.600]  the bad guys, so in discord
[03:39:51.600 --> 03:39:53.600]  once slowed down Nancy Pelosi's
[03:39:53.600 --> 03:39:55.600]  feature of time
[03:39:55.600 --> 03:39:57.600]  so again that Nancy Pelosi
[03:39:57.600 --> 03:39:59.600]  meme was intended as a piece of satire
[03:39:59.600 --> 03:40:01.600]  the media took it seriously
[03:40:01.600 --> 03:40:03.600]  and claimed it was a threat
[03:40:03.600 --> 03:40:05.600]  to democracy just as they claimed
[03:40:05.600 --> 03:40:07.600]  that I had artificially
[03:40:07.600 --> 03:40:09.600]  doctored the Jim Acosta
[03:40:09.600 --> 03:40:11.600]  White House intern video
[03:40:11.600 --> 03:40:13.600]  when no such thing happened
[03:40:13.600 --> 03:40:15.600]  they lied about it and stuck with that lie
[03:40:15.600 --> 03:40:17.600]  and claimed that it was
[03:40:17.600 --> 03:40:19.600]  a fake news story when it wasn't
[03:40:19.600 --> 03:40:21.600]  she continues
[03:40:21.600 --> 03:40:23.600]  the Pentagon's targets aren't limited
[03:40:23.600 --> 03:40:25.600]  to deep fakes the bogeyman of the month
[03:40:25.600 --> 03:40:27.600]  being used to justify this unprecedented
[03:40:27.600 --> 03:40:29.600]  military intrusion into social media
[03:40:29.600 --> 03:40:31.600]  or news realm or fake news at all
[03:40:31.600 --> 03:40:33.600]  if the program is successful
[03:40:33.600 --> 03:40:35.600]  after four years of trials
[03:40:35.600 --> 03:40:37.600]  it will be expanded
[03:40:37.600 --> 03:40:39.600]  to target all quote malicious intent
[03:40:39.600 --> 03:40:41.600]  a possibility that should
[03:40:41.600 --> 03:40:43.600]  send chills down the spine of any journalist
[03:40:43.600 --> 03:40:45.600]  who's ever disagreed
[03:40:45.600 --> 03:40:47.600]  with the establishment narrative
[03:40:47.600 --> 03:40:49.600]  so basically they run
[03:40:49.600 --> 03:40:51.600]  the studies of the past three years
[03:40:51.600 --> 03:40:53.600]  they found that memes were hugely influential
[03:40:53.600 --> 03:40:55.600]  in electing Donald Trump
[03:40:55.600 --> 03:40:57.600]  in seizing control of the narrative
[03:40:57.600 --> 03:40:59.600]  from the establishment from the mainstream media
[03:40:59.600 --> 03:41:01.600]  just like Facebook
[03:41:01.600 --> 03:41:03.600]  the Pentagon is now getting
[03:41:03.600 --> 03:41:05.600]  involved in identifying
[03:41:05.600 --> 03:41:07.600]  and crushing quote viral
[03:41:07.600 --> 03:41:09.600]  content before it's
[03:41:09.600 --> 03:41:11.600]  even allowed to spread
[03:41:11.600 --> 03:41:13.600]  another absolutely chilling imposition
[03:41:13.600 --> 03:41:15.600]  on freedom
[03:41:15.600 --> 03:41:17.600]  of the internet
[03:41:17.600 --> 03:41:19.600]  meanwhile over in Hong Kong
[03:41:19.600 --> 03:41:21.600]  China unloads troops
[03:41:21.600 --> 03:41:23.600]  and cargo into Hong Kong from
[03:41:23.600 --> 03:41:25.600]  giant ship amidst rumors of crackdown
[03:41:25.600 --> 03:41:27.600]  of course we've got this big day coming up
[03:41:27.600 --> 03:41:29.600]  of October 1st which is the 70th
[03:41:29.600 --> 03:41:31.600]  anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic
[03:41:31.600 --> 03:41:33.600]  of Communist China
[03:41:33.600 --> 03:41:35.600]  experts say China
[03:41:35.600 --> 03:41:37.600]  has to get in there and crush this
[03:41:37.600 --> 03:41:39.600]  growing protest movement
[03:41:39.600 --> 03:41:41.600]  which is only getting more violent
[03:41:41.600 --> 03:41:43.600]  before that date
[03:41:43.600 --> 03:41:45.600]  1st of October
[03:41:45.600 --> 03:41:47.600]  to save face to save
[03:41:47.600 --> 03:41:49.600]  Beijing embarrassment
[03:41:49.600 --> 03:41:51.600]  so now we have a story
[03:41:51.600 --> 03:41:53.600]  because we covered this last week
[03:41:53.600 --> 03:41:55.600]  where they claimed it was a routine rotation
[03:41:55.600 --> 03:41:57.600]  of troops China does have a garrison
[03:41:57.600 --> 03:41:59.600]  of troops within Hong Kong
[03:41:59.600 --> 03:42:01.600]  they claimed that the
[03:42:01.600 --> 03:42:03.600]  military vehicles rolling through the streets of Hong Kong
[03:42:03.600 --> 03:42:05.600]  were just part of that routine circulation
[03:42:05.600 --> 03:42:07.600]  that routine roll out
[03:42:07.600 --> 03:42:09.600]  but now a ship arrived
[03:42:09.600 --> 03:42:11.600]  it was carrying military vehicles
[03:42:11.600 --> 03:42:13.600]  it was carrying at least hundreds of troops
[03:42:13.600 --> 03:42:15.600]  it was a 140
[03:42:15.600 --> 03:42:17.600]  meter long vehicle carrier
[03:42:17.600 --> 03:42:19.600]  arrived on August 28
[03:42:19.600 --> 03:42:21.600]  and in images which were
[03:42:21.600 --> 03:42:23.600]  broadcast by CCTV
[03:42:23.600 --> 03:42:25.600]  which is basically Chinese state media
[03:42:25.600 --> 03:42:27.600]  they show pat
[03:42:27.600 --> 03:42:29.600]  through to people's armed police
[03:42:29.600 --> 03:42:31.600]  troops rolling out of this
[03:42:31.600 --> 03:42:33.600]  ship now why is that important
[03:42:33.600 --> 03:42:35.600]  well because as of last month
[03:42:35.600 --> 03:42:37.600]  we know that those same troops
[03:42:37.600 --> 03:42:39.600]  were being housed in a sports stadium
[03:42:39.600 --> 03:42:41.600]  and they were training
[03:42:41.600 --> 03:42:43.600]  with military precision
[03:42:43.600 --> 03:42:45.600]  to crush dissent in Hong Kong
[03:42:45.600 --> 03:42:47.600]  so have those troops now actually be moved
[03:42:47.600 --> 03:42:49.600]  into Hong Kong proper
[03:42:49.600 --> 03:42:51.600]  we'll be back with more this is the art show
[03:42:51.600 --> 03:42:53.600]  band.video
[03:42:53.600 --> 03:42:55.600]  is the answer to censorship
[03:42:55.600 --> 03:42:57.600]  band.video
[03:42:57.600 --> 03:42:59.600]  is the answer for libertarians
[03:42:59.600 --> 03:43:01.600]  conservatives, nationalists, pro-gun
[03:43:01.600 --> 03:43:03.600]  pro-life, pro-human individuals
[03:43:03.600 --> 03:43:05.600]  to have their own platform
[03:43:05.600 --> 03:43:07.600]  where videos
[03:43:07.600 --> 03:43:09.600]  banned by YouTube, Facebook and Twitter
[03:43:09.600 --> 03:43:11.600]  are still available

[03:43:13.600 --> 03:43:15.600]  it's now live
[03:43:15.600 --> 03:43:17.600]  band.video
[03:43:17.600 --> 03:43:19.600]  isn't just going to be a home
[03:43:19.600 --> 03:43:21.600]  for Alex Jones or David Knight
[03:43:21.600 --> 03:43:23.600]  or Owen Schreuer or Paul Watson
[03:43:23.600 --> 03:43:25.600]  we are building it to be a place
[03:43:25.600 --> 03:43:27.600]  where banned memes are able to be posted
[03:43:27.600 --> 03:43:29.600]  and where a growing list
[03:43:29.600 --> 03:43:31.600]  of freedom loving contributors
[03:43:31.600 --> 03:43:33.600]  are able to have a home
[03:43:33.600 --> 03:43:35.600]  being shut down, free from being
[03:43:35.600 --> 03:43:37.600]  censored, free from being silenced
[03:43:37.600 --> 03:43:39.600]  by big tech, the chai comms
[03:43:39.600 --> 03:43:41.600]  the Hollywood scum and the globalist
[03:43:41.600 --> 03:43:43.600]  freedom of speech has a home
[03:43:43.600 --> 03:43:45.600]  it's called band.video

[03:47:29.600 --> 03:47:31.600]  shit there into hong kong
[03:47:33.600 --> 03:47:35.600]  coming off the ship of course we know
[03:47:35.600 --> 03:47:37.600]  that these troops were massing
[03:47:37.600 --> 03:47:39.600]  in nearby shenzhen
[03:47:39.600 --> 03:47:41.600]  which of course
[03:47:41.600 --> 03:47:43.600]  houses those troops they were practicing drills
[03:47:43.600 --> 03:47:45.600]  aimed around crushing descent
[03:47:45.600 --> 03:47:47.600]  now they've been transported
[03:47:47.600 --> 03:47:49.600]  from hong kong
[03:47:49.600 --> 03:47:51.600]  from shenzhen sorry to hong kong
[03:47:51.600 --> 03:47:53.600]  on the ship they're wondering whether
[03:47:53.600 --> 03:47:55.600]  this is a routine rotation of these
[03:47:55.600 --> 03:47:57.600]  troops of course in my video about
[03:47:57.600 --> 03:47:59.600]  hong kong which i put out last week
[03:47:59.600 --> 03:48:01.600]  we showed the actual footage
[03:48:01.600 --> 03:48:03.600]  from the tried chinese pla
[03:48:03.600 --> 03:48:05.600]  we showed in their intimidation
[03:48:05.600 --> 03:48:07.600]  tactics against the hong kong
[03:48:07.600 --> 03:48:09.600]  protesters literally pla troops
[03:48:09.600 --> 03:48:11.600]  training to gun them down
[03:48:11.600 --> 03:48:13.600]  they weren't backward in
[03:48:13.600 --> 03:48:15.600]  coming forward about their true intentions
[03:48:15.600 --> 03:48:17.600]  so now they're wondering
[03:48:17.600 --> 03:48:19.600]  whether these troops have been
[03:48:19.600 --> 03:48:21.600]  offloaded from the ship
[03:48:21.600 --> 03:48:23.600]  or part of that force that is
[03:48:23.600 --> 03:48:25.600]  intended to go into hong kong
[03:48:25.600 --> 03:48:27.600]  and crush these protests which again
[03:48:27.600 --> 03:48:29.600]  are only getting more severe
[03:48:29.600 --> 03:48:31.600]  only escalating in
[03:48:31.600 --> 03:48:33.600]  their severity
[03:48:33.600 --> 03:48:35.600]  i was in hong kong
[03:48:35.600 --> 03:48:37.600]  of course last week
[03:48:37.600 --> 03:48:39.600]  and
[03:48:39.600 --> 03:48:41.600]  just to stress again the protest
[03:48:41.600 --> 03:48:43.600]  actually adamant everyone we spoke to
[03:48:43.600 --> 03:48:45.600]  to a man said that
[03:48:45.600 --> 03:48:47.600]  they will not stop until these
[03:48:47.600 --> 03:48:49.600]  five demands have been met
[03:48:49.600 --> 03:48:51.600]  and you'll see some of the footage today
[03:48:51.600 --> 03:48:53.600]  there's another headline up on summit news
[03:48:53.600 --> 03:48:55.600]  smart video shows hong kong
[03:48:55.600 --> 03:48:57.600]  protesters turning tear gas into
[03:48:57.600 --> 03:48:59.600]  harmless solid form again this goes
[03:48:59.600 --> 03:49:01.600]  to the point these are not
[03:49:01.600 --> 03:49:03.600]  idiot and tifa chicken neck radicals
[03:49:03.600 --> 03:49:05.600]  starting fights with people because
[03:49:05.600 --> 03:49:07.600]  they're flying american flags in fact
[03:49:07.600 --> 03:49:09.600]  many of the protesters in hong kong
[03:49:09.600 --> 03:49:11.600]  they're waving pepeg banners
[03:49:11.600 --> 03:49:13.600]  these are smart young
[03:49:13.600 --> 03:49:15.600]  students many of them
[03:49:15.600 --> 03:49:17.600]  chemistry students someone
[03:49:17.600 --> 03:49:19.600]  joked about this video
[03:49:19.600 --> 03:49:21.600]  which shows one of the protesters
[03:49:21.600 --> 03:49:23.600]  literally turning a c s gas
[03:49:23.600 --> 03:49:25.600]  grenade into its homeless solid form
[03:49:25.600 --> 03:49:27.600]  by grabbing it placing it
[03:49:27.600 --> 03:49:29.600]  inside a liquid nitrogen
[03:49:29.600 --> 03:49:31.600]  canister
[03:49:31.600 --> 03:49:33.600]  and pouring it out again in its
[03:49:33.600 --> 03:49:35.600]  solid form somebody joked
[03:49:35.600 --> 03:49:37.600]  imagine what they could do if they had
[03:49:37.600 --> 03:49:39.600]  degrees in sociology and gender
[03:49:39.600 --> 03:49:41.600]  studies which of course
[03:49:41.600 --> 03:49:43.600]  is what the anti for have degrees in
[03:49:43.600 --> 03:49:45.600]  so again despite looking similar to the
[03:49:45.600 --> 03:49:47.600]  anti for these protesters are hardcore
[03:49:47.600 --> 03:49:49.600]  they have a true authentic
[03:49:49.600 --> 03:49:51.600]  understanding of what they're fighting
[03:49:51.600 --> 03:49:53.600]  for not a hysterical
[03:49:53.600 --> 03:49:55.600]  moral panic about non-existent
[03:49:55.600 --> 03:49:57.600]  nazis taking over society
[03:49:57.600 --> 03:49:59.600]  but against one of the most feared
[03:49:59.600 --> 03:50:01.600]  military regimes on the planet
[03:50:01.600 --> 03:50:03.600]  which is massing in
[03:50:03.600 --> 03:50:05.600]  nearby shenzhen and waiting to take
[03:50:05.600 --> 03:50:07.600]  over
[03:50:07.600 --> 03:50:09.600]  so now they're literally capturing
[03:50:09.600 --> 03:50:11.600]  c s grenade gas canisters
[03:50:11.600 --> 03:50:13.600]  and putting turning them into their liquid form
[03:50:13.600 --> 03:50:15.600]  showing you again
[03:50:15.600 --> 03:50:17.600]  you know how intelligent these young
[03:50:17.600 --> 03:50:19.600]  students really are who by the way
[03:50:19.600 --> 03:50:21.600]  again and again said to us when we were there
[03:50:21.600 --> 03:50:23.600]  that one of the main reasons
[03:50:23.600 --> 03:50:25.600]  they're protesting is against
[03:50:25.600 --> 03:50:27.600]  mass migration from mainland
[03:50:27.600 --> 03:50:29.600]  China this is something that the mainstream
[03:50:29.600 --> 03:50:31.600]  media refuses to report
[03:50:31.600 --> 03:50:33.600]  these are young kids students saying
[03:50:33.600 --> 03:50:35.600]  they are sick and tired
[03:50:35.600 --> 03:50:37.600]  of China abusing the system
[03:50:37.600 --> 03:50:39.600]  sending migrants in as a kind
[03:50:39.600 --> 03:50:41.600]  of invasion force to subsume
[03:50:41.600 --> 03:50:43.600]  to subvert their society
[03:50:43.600 --> 03:50:45.600]  because not only do they get access
[03:50:45.600 --> 03:50:47.600]  to benefits and jobs immediately
[03:50:47.600 --> 03:50:49.600]  they can move straight
[03:50:49.600 --> 03:50:51.600]  there by property do whatever they want
[03:50:51.600 --> 03:50:53.600]  they also get immediate access to vote
[03:50:53.600 --> 03:50:55.600]  so of course they're going to vote
[03:50:55.600 --> 03:50:57.600]  in pro-beijing politicians
[03:50:57.600 --> 03:50:59.600]  they're going to vote against the
[03:50:59.600 --> 03:51:01.600]  interests of the Hong Kong people
[03:51:01.600 --> 03:51:03.600]  and the Hong Kong student movement
[03:51:03.600 --> 03:51:05.600]  pointing out that mass migration
[03:51:05.600 --> 03:51:07.600]  is one of the main threats
[03:51:07.600 --> 03:51:09.600]  to their freedoms, to their way of life
[03:51:09.600 --> 03:51:11.600]  to the cohesion of their society
[03:51:11.600 --> 03:51:13.600]  which up until this point has been really good
[03:51:15.600 --> 03:51:17.600]  and so they're out on the streets
[03:51:17.600 --> 03:51:19.600]  and they're not going to give up
[03:51:19.600 --> 03:51:21.600]  they're also protesting against the social
[03:51:21.600 --> 03:51:23.600]  credit system we saw in Hong Kong last week
[03:51:23.600 --> 03:51:25.600]  protesters literally
[03:51:25.600 --> 03:51:27.600]  tearing down smart lamps
[03:51:27.600 --> 03:51:29.600]  which they claim
[03:51:29.600 --> 03:51:31.600]  the Hong Kong authorities claim are there
[03:51:31.600 --> 03:51:33.600]  to just detect air quality
[03:51:33.600 --> 03:51:35.600]  they're actually there to
[03:51:35.600 --> 03:51:37.600]  use facial recognition
[03:51:37.600 --> 03:51:39.600]  tracking to identify these protests
[03:51:39.600 --> 03:51:41.600]  according to some of them who we spoke to
[03:51:41.600 --> 03:51:43.600]  now we have another story
[03:51:43.600 --> 03:51:45.600]  on summit.news social credit system
[03:51:45.600 --> 03:51:47.600]  facial recognition cameras monitor
[03:51:47.600 --> 03:51:49.600]  Chinese student behaviour in class
[03:51:49.600 --> 03:51:51.600]  University in China has installed
[03:51:51.600 --> 03:51:53.600]  facial recognition cameras in classrooms
[03:51:53.600 --> 03:51:55.600]  that monitor students behaviour
[03:51:55.600 --> 03:51:57.600]  such as nodding off or playing with their
[03:51:57.600 --> 03:51:59.600]  cell phones
[03:51:59.600 --> 03:52:01.600]  now there was a report that this had also
[03:52:01.600 --> 03:52:03.600]  been introduced into the United States
[03:52:03.600 --> 03:52:05.600]  already
[03:52:05.600 --> 03:52:07.600]  so we've got the exact same system
[03:52:07.600 --> 03:52:09.600]  being introduced into the West
[03:52:09.600 --> 03:52:11.600]  just as we have the same social credit
[03:52:11.600 --> 03:52:13.600]  system being introduced
[03:52:13.600 --> 03:52:15.600]  in terms of de-platforming
[03:52:15.600 --> 03:52:17.600]  and banning people from having bank accounts
[03:52:17.600 --> 03:52:19.600]  because of their political opinion
[03:52:19.600 --> 03:52:21.600]  whatever communist China can do
[03:52:21.600 --> 03:52:23.600]  corporations in the West
[03:52:23.600 --> 03:52:25.600]  social justice worries apparently want to do
[03:52:25.600 --> 03:52:27.600]  better
[03:52:27.600 --> 03:52:29.600]  now China pharmaceutical university in Nanjing
[03:52:29.600 --> 03:52:31.600]  East China's Jiangsu province
[03:52:31.600 --> 03:52:33.600]  is piloting the system in two classrooms
[03:52:33.600 --> 03:52:35.600]  and eventually plans to install it in every classroom
[03:52:35.600 --> 03:52:37.600]  so the system
[03:52:37.600 --> 03:52:39.600]  can access every student's personal information
[03:52:39.600 --> 03:52:41.600]  and monitor their behaviour in class such as
[03:52:41.600 --> 03:52:43.600]  nodding off and playing with their mobile
[03:52:43.600 --> 03:52:45.600]  phones according to global times
[03:52:45.600 --> 03:52:47.600]  which again is the communist party mouthpiece
[03:52:47.600 --> 03:52:49.600]  the cameras also can record
[03:52:49.600 --> 03:52:51.600]  truancy whether students
[03:52:51.600 --> 03:52:53.600]  are listening or not how often
[03:52:53.600 --> 03:52:55.600]  they lock up and down and whether
[03:52:55.600 --> 03:52:57.600]  they leave early
[03:52:57.600 --> 03:52:59.600]  students complain the system is an invasion of their privacy
[03:52:59.600 --> 03:53:01.600]  but school officials insist
[03:53:01.600 --> 03:53:03.600]  the cameras aren't necessary to encourage discipline
[03:53:03.600 --> 03:53:05.600]  and of course
[03:53:05.600 --> 03:53:07.600]  they're eventually going to be tied in
[03:53:07.600 --> 03:53:09.600]  to this social credit score
[03:53:09.600 --> 03:53:11.600]  where people are rewarded
[03:53:11.600 --> 03:53:13.600]  or punished
[03:53:13.600 --> 03:53:15.600]  for how well behaved they've been
[03:53:15.600 --> 03:53:17.600]  now bear in mind this goes down
[03:53:17.600 --> 03:53:19.600]  to the level of literally
[03:53:19.600 --> 03:53:21.600]  punishing people for buying too much alcohol
[03:53:21.600 --> 03:53:23.600]  for playing too many video games
[03:53:23.600 --> 03:53:25.600]  in another case they actually
[03:53:25.600 --> 03:53:27.600]  stopped people from going on dating
[03:53:27.600 --> 03:53:29.600]  websites if their
[03:53:29.600 --> 03:53:31.600]  social credit score was too low
[03:53:31.600 --> 03:53:33.600]  it's literally something straight out
[03:53:33.600 --> 03:53:35.600]  of a black mirror episode
[03:53:35.600 --> 03:53:37.600]  like literally that was an episode on this exact thing
[03:53:37.600 --> 03:53:39.600]  and of course
[03:53:39.600 --> 03:53:41.600]  the Chinese government as we reported last month
[03:53:41.600 --> 03:53:43.600]  bragged about preventing
[03:53:43.600 --> 03:53:45.600]  2.5 million quote discredited entities
[03:53:45.600 --> 03:53:47.600]  from purchasing plane tickets
[03:53:47.600 --> 03:53:49.600]  and 90,000 people from buying
[03:53:49.600 --> 03:53:51.600]  high-speed train tickets
[03:53:51.600 --> 03:53:53.600]  in the month of July alone
[03:53:53.600 --> 03:53:55.600]  so if you say something bad
[03:53:55.600 --> 03:53:57.600]  against the government in favor
[03:53:57.600 --> 03:53:59.600]  of the Hong Kong protesters
[03:53:59.600 --> 03:54:01.600]  your ability to literally engage
[03:54:01.600 --> 03:54:03.600]  in basic commerce and travel
[03:54:03.600 --> 03:54:05.600]  is restricted is withdrawn
[03:54:05.600 --> 03:54:07.600]  and that's exactly the same system
[03:54:07.600 --> 03:54:09.600]  the left and massive
[03:54:09.600 --> 03:54:11.600]  Silicon Valley corporations
[03:54:11.600 --> 03:54:13.600]  want to introduce into America
[03:54:13.600 --> 03:54:15.600]  absolutely
[03:54:15.600 --> 03:54:17.600]  chilling I'm sure you'll agree
[03:54:17.600 --> 03:54:19.600]  which is why we support
[03:54:19.600 --> 03:54:21.600]  the Hong Kong protesters
[03:54:21.600 --> 03:54:23.600]  meanwhile
[03:54:23.600 --> 03:54:25.600]  on the subject of migration in Spain
[03:54:25.600 --> 03:54:27.600]  migrants arrive in Spain
[03:54:27.600 --> 03:54:29.600]  by a boat scramble of cliff base
[03:54:29.600 --> 03:54:31.600]  we've seen videos like this over and over again in Spain
[03:54:31.600 --> 03:54:33.600]  once they got a socialist government
[03:54:33.600 --> 03:54:35.600]  and they basically rolled out the red carpet
[03:54:35.600 --> 03:54:37.600]  for the migrant wave to head into Spain
[03:54:37.600 --> 03:54:39.600]  by these NGO boats
[03:54:39.600 --> 03:54:41.600]  which have routinely been caught
[03:54:41.600 --> 03:54:43.600]  conspiring with criminal people
[03:54:43.600 --> 03:54:45.600]  smugglers to bring these people into Europe
[03:54:45.600 --> 03:54:47.600]  now of course the Salvini government
[03:54:47.600 --> 03:54:49.600]  in Italy has collapsed
[03:54:49.600 --> 03:54:51.600]  that migrant WRETH UG
[03:54:51.600 --> 03:54:53.600]  route into Europe
[03:54:53.600 --> 03:54:55.600]  into northern Europe eventually
[03:54:55.600 --> 03:54:57.600]  is about to set up
[03:54:57.600 --> 03:54:59.600]  and start again
[03:54:59.600 --> 03:55:01.600]  so any only plans that this migrant crisis
[03:55:01.600 --> 03:55:03.600]  was finished was over
[03:55:03.600 --> 03:55:05.600]  it's only just beginning
[03:55:05.600 --> 03:55:07.600]  a video out of the beef that shows
[03:55:07.600 --> 03:55:09.600]  16 Algerian migrants driving via a small boat
[03:55:09.600 --> 03:55:11.600]  before scrambling up a cliff base
[03:55:11.600 --> 03:55:13.600]  a stunned fisherman filmed a footage
[03:55:13.600 --> 03:55:15.600]  on Saturday morning close to the airport
[03:55:15.600 --> 03:55:17.600]  in Ibiza
[03:55:17.600 --> 03:55:19.600]  and again it shows 16 migrants abandoning
[03:55:19.600 --> 03:55:21.600]  a small vessel and clambering up a cliff base
[03:55:21.600 --> 03:55:23.600]  before being arrested
[03:55:23.600 --> 03:55:25.600]  they had a total of 51 migrants
[03:55:25.600 --> 03:55:27.600]  who were arrested over the weekend after four boats arrived
[03:55:27.600 --> 03:55:29.600]  in Ibiza
[03:55:29.600 --> 03:55:31.600]  again this is a holiday destination
[03:55:31.600 --> 03:55:33.600]  the footage emphasises
[03:55:33.600 --> 03:55:35.600]  the completely porous nature of Europe's borders
[03:55:35.600 --> 03:55:37.600]  despite many declaring the migrant crisis to be over
[03:55:37.600 --> 03:55:39.600]  they now have
[03:55:39.600 --> 03:55:41.600]  10 migrants shipped
[03:55:41.600 --> 03:55:43.600]  10 NGO ships now operating in the MED
[03:55:43.600 --> 03:55:45.600]  as Italian leftists push for opening borders
[03:55:45.600 --> 03:55:47.600]  this is out of Breitbart
[03:55:47.600 --> 03:55:49.600]  10 migrant transport NGO vessels
[03:55:49.600 --> 03:55:51.600]  now operating in the Mediterranean
[03:55:51.600 --> 03:55:53.600]  the left wing establishment Democrat party
[03:55:53.600 --> 03:55:55.600]  looks to reopen Italy's ports
[03:55:55.600 --> 03:55:57.600]  so the Salvini
[03:55:57.600 --> 03:55:59.600]  league of government collapsed in Italy
[03:55:59.600 --> 03:56:01.600]  and that led to the formation
[03:56:01.600 --> 03:56:03.600]  of a new coalition between the populist
[03:56:03.600 --> 03:56:05.600]  fire star party and the left
[03:56:05.600 --> 03:56:07.600]  democratic party
[03:56:07.600 --> 03:56:09.600]  who have already indicated
[03:56:09.600 --> 03:56:11.600]  that Salvini's strict immigration policy
[03:56:11.600 --> 03:56:13.600]  which by the way
[03:56:13.600 --> 03:56:15.600]  has harmed the number of migrant deaths
[03:56:15.600 --> 03:56:17.600]  at bad
[03:56:17.600 --> 03:56:19.600]  actually saving people's lives that's bad
[03:56:19.600 --> 03:56:21.600]  by not incentivising them coming in the first place
[03:56:21.600 --> 03:56:23.600]  that's terrible
[03:56:23.600 --> 03:56:25.600]  now they're going to reopen the route
[03:56:25.600 --> 03:56:27.600]  this is going to lead to hundreds if not thousands
[03:56:27.600 --> 03:56:29.600]  of more deaths
[03:56:29.600 --> 03:56:31.600]  and it's going to lead to some of the massive
[03:56:31.600 --> 03:56:33.600]  crime rape sexual assault problems that Europe
[03:56:33.600 --> 03:56:35.600]  has experienced as a result of this
[03:56:35.600 --> 03:56:37.600]  migrant wave
[03:56:37.600 --> 03:56:39.600]  the NGO Mediterranean saving humans
[03:56:39.600 --> 03:56:41.600]  was granted permission
[03:56:41.600 --> 03:56:43.600]  for their vessel to land on Monday
[03:56:43.600 --> 03:56:45.600]  the NGO celebrated the move
[03:56:45.600 --> 03:56:47.600]  writing that Odyssey is over
[03:56:47.600 --> 03:56:49.600]  and a bit of humanity can be seen on the horizon
[03:56:49.600 --> 03:56:51.600]  welcome to Europe
[03:56:51.600 --> 03:56:53.600]  and again
[03:56:53.600 --> 03:56:55.600]  if you go back to the video out of Ibiza Spain
[03:56:55.600 --> 03:56:57.600]  I actually
[03:56:57.600 --> 03:56:59.600]  showed the recent arrival of 150 migrants
[03:56:59.600 --> 03:57:01.600]  storming through Spain's suitor enclave
[03:57:01.600 --> 03:57:03.600]  down on the border there with Morocco
[03:57:03.600 --> 03:57:05.600]  didn't really resemble
[03:57:05.600 --> 03:57:07.600]  doctors and lawyers
[03:57:07.600 --> 03:57:09.600]  those people streaming into Spain
[03:57:09.600 --> 03:57:11.600]  did they? there you go
[03:57:11.600 --> 03:57:13.600]  the doctors and lawyers streaming in
[03:57:13.600 --> 03:57:15.600]  there is the cultural enrichment
[03:57:15.600 --> 03:57:17.600]  as emphasised by this story
[03:57:17.600 --> 03:57:19.600]  afghanic stamp to American tourist
[03:57:19.600 --> 03:57:21.600]  Amsterdam train station
[03:57:21.600 --> 03:57:23.600]  they travel to Holland to protect the Prophet Muhammad
[03:57:23.600 --> 03:57:25.600]  and kill unfair
[03:57:25.600 --> 03:57:27.600]  and cruel people
[03:57:27.600 --> 03:57:29.600]  that is the kind of cultural enrichment
[03:57:29.600 --> 03:57:31.600]  diversity that will be streaming into Europe
[03:57:31.600 --> 03:57:33.600]  once again
[03:57:33.600 --> 03:57:35.600]  thanks for watching
