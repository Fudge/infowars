[01:11.180 --> 01:17.980]  of the nightly news joining us coming up later in the broadcast is the legendary
[01:17.980 --> 01:22.980]  New York narcotics detective Frank Serpacob one of our producers noticed
[01:22.980 --> 01:28.380]  that on his own blog it sounded like info wars calm so we contacted him and
[01:28.380 --> 01:34.560]  that is scheduled for today also we have our weekly visit with Bob Chapman of the
[01:34.560 --> 01:37.780]  International Forecaster to break down the big developments in the economy and
[01:37.780 --> 01:44.180]  Richard Reeves who's been a big volunteer supporter and you know delegate
[01:44.180 --> 01:48.380]  working with Ron Paul in the last election he shared to talk about real
[01:48.380 --> 01:52.980]  strategies to really get Ron Paul elected and that of course is being a
[01:52.980 --> 01:59.420]  delegate from your district in your town or city or at least working to be one
[01:59.420 --> 02:02.700]  because you can educate people throughout the process and fight party
[02:02.700 --> 02:07.620]  insiders from trying to block congressman Ron Paul so Richard Reeves in
[02:07.620 --> 02:16.100]  studio today that said we're working on some really big guests next week I'm
[02:16.100 --> 02:19.500]  just gonna leave it at that for listeners you'll definitely not want to
[02:19.500 --> 02:28.620]  miss any of the broadcast next week you know I like surprises I say it at the
[02:28.620 --> 02:32.700]  start of the broadcast every day now it just gets more and more insane by the
[02:32.700 --> 02:37.940]  day by the hour to the point of completely being overwhelmed here we
[02:37.940 --> 02:42.500]  obviously have the economic news futures tumble is global recession fears
[02:42.500 --> 02:49.140]  spread world stocks plunge on growing recession fears Obama is taking a two
[02:49.140 --> 02:52.500]  week vacation in the middle of all of this that's become a big national issue
[02:52.500 --> 02:56.100]  and it should be but again he's a puppet in chief and he knows it so why
[02:56.100 --> 02:59.340]  should he be there reading off a teleprompter he's just gonna hide out and
[02:59.340 --> 03:05.180]  reward himself with a long vacation for a job well done pacifying the public
[03:05.180 --> 03:07.980]  making them think that everything's gonna be okay you know we've all seen the
[03:07.980 --> 03:12.460]  eclipse of high-level black Democrats in the Senate House saying that they don't
[03:12.460 --> 03:16.740]  like Obama and he sold them out Nancy Pelosi being booed by her own insiders
[03:16.740 --> 03:19.940]  saying she's a sellout well she sold out a long time ago I mean what do you
[03:19.940 --> 03:24.420]  people expect you think Republican insiders like Rick Perry or Mitt Romney
[03:24.420 --> 03:28.460]  are are gonna reverse the tide of criminality that's running out of
[03:28.460 --> 03:32.100]  control do you think Democrats are gonna do that when they've been bought and
[03:32.100 --> 03:36.540]  paid for their entire careers anybody who the mainstream media praises and
[03:36.540 --> 03:41.140]  gives attention to is an establishment individual unless that attention is
[03:41.140 --> 03:46.660]  demonization like Ron Paul and I saw a Pew research piece out that Curt
[03:46.660 --> 03:50.540]  Neymar wrote about yesterday showing that Ron Paul gets the least amount of
[03:50.540 --> 03:53.900]  media coverage in their own analysis than any other candidate but we can
[03:53.900 --> 03:58.220]  already see that ourselves but here it is scientifically broken down even though
[03:58.220 --> 04:02.740]  he is in the top three candidates and undoubtedly even the AP admits steering
[04:02.740 --> 04:06.900]  the entire Republican side of the election right now in the primaries
[04:06.900 --> 04:11.820]  he's dominating he's setting the debate he is the leader and so they're
[04:11.820 --> 04:17.020]  freaking out saying he can't win he can't win that hoax imploded Monday and so
[04:17.020 --> 04:22.340]  now they've shifted to you know a Kiebler elf might have once heard him say
[04:22.340 --> 04:26.340]  something racist and he's not a medical doctor and he kidnaps women I mean
[04:26.340 --> 04:30.100]  you're gonna get the exact same dirty tricks you saw against Rand that were
[04:30.100 --> 04:35.980]  completely false but they were so wild that some people bought into it until it
[04:35.980 --> 04:39.140]  came out that they were staged events and then it backfired on the
[04:39.140 --> 04:43.780]  establishment and ran got a 10 percent turbo charge there in the last few
[04:43.780 --> 04:49.540]  weeks of the last election okay I haven't even gotten into the latest
[04:49.540 --> 04:54.780]  reason Obama is legalizing the illegal aliens by fiat why does he need a
[04:54.780 --> 04:58.300]  Congress to launch a war why does he need a Congress to put TSA on the streets
[04:58.300 --> 05:04.000]  they're right back congratulations to our friends at eFoodsDirect.com in

[08:04.620 --> 08:09.780]  Jones show because there's a war on for your mind
[08:16.780 --> 08:24.360]  it is Friday the 19th day of August 2011 I'm Alex Jones your host the
[08:24.360 --> 08:29.660]  legendary New York narcotics detective Frank Cervico is scheduled to be
[08:29.660 --> 08:33.660]  joining us later in the broadcast today we also have our weekly visit with Bob
[08:33.660 --> 08:37.660]  Chapman on the economy extremely timely right now obviously with the global
[08:37.660 --> 08:43.740]  meltdown accelerating and of course we also have my good friend Richard Reeves
[08:43.740 --> 08:48.780]  a great political analyst activist talk show host in his own right joining us in
[08:48.780 --> 08:53.340]  studio to talk about strategies to ensure we're then the party structure that
[08:53.340 --> 08:59.100]  Ron Paul wins the nomination or bare minimum that we block a Mitt Romney or
[08:59.100 --> 09:06.020]  someone like that it is Richard's view that well that Barack Obama would be
[09:06.020 --> 09:10.460]  even better than getting a Rick Perry in because of the Republicans get the house
[09:10.460 --> 09:17.000]  the Senate and the presidency led by Rick Perry mr. forced inoculation mr.
[09:17.000 --> 09:22.180]  NAFTA superhighway mr. North American Union mr. amnesty for illegals and
[09:22.180 --> 09:26.620]  in-state tuition for illegals I mean this guy Al Gore's former chief of staff
[09:26.620 --> 09:36.700]  is an absolute nightmare at the end of the day I'm probably even disagree with
[09:36.700 --> 09:43.300]  Richard we'll debate it today when he's in studio with us because and and it's
[09:43.300 --> 09:47.660]  probably just a sign of the times that the elite are going for broke but
[09:47.660 --> 09:54.700]  Obama's doing things that no president has ever done since the civil war since
[09:54.700 --> 10:01.780]  what happened with the suspension of the Constitution or I don't know five years
[10:01.780 --> 10:06.220]  under Lincoln well I guess four years under Lincoln and then for another year
[10:06.220 --> 10:12.700]  or two under Ulysses S. Grant and that is completely ignoring Congress and the
[10:12.700 --> 10:17.460]  courts and that of course is our top story today that I'll be getting into
[10:17.460 --> 10:25.300]  after I go over some of the other news here Obama has launched a war now four
[10:25.300 --> 10:29.140]  and a half months in in Libyans and told Congress you don't have any authority
[10:29.140 --> 10:33.940]  I'll do whatever I want my authority comes from the UN the exact quote is my
[10:33.940 --> 10:38.020]  authority comes from the UN I've done this for the credibility of the UN and
[10:38.020 --> 10:42.180]  it certainly does expand its evil credibility I mean he's saying I'll I
[10:42.180 --> 10:47.820]  take more orders from them not from Congress he's put carbon taxes in and
[10:47.820 --> 10:51.940]  regulations over power plants all across the country particularly coal power
[10:51.940 --> 10:56.460]  and factories that are not insiders he's given all his insider buddies complete
[10:56.460 --> 11:01.300]  waivers on record general electric and others he has instituted anti-gun
[11:01.300 --> 11:07.100]  moves outside of law via the ATF and for Western states and has said he's may
[11:07.100 --> 11:11.040]  come out with an executive order putting people on no gun by list who have no
[11:11.040 --> 11:16.980]  criminal record and with no due process no judge no jury can't find out wire on
[11:16.980 --> 11:20.580]  the list and undoubtedly they're gonna have beta test where they show examples
[11:20.580 --> 11:23.980]  of Muslim extremists and people who weren't criminals but that they stopped
[11:23.980 --> 11:28.180]  with this program just to sell the idea so grandpa can't buy a gun and veterans
[11:28.180 --> 11:34.820]  can't buy a gun very very dangerous time he has obviously worked with the
[11:34.820 --> 11:37.860]  traitorous leadership of the Republican and Democratic parties Mitch
[11:37.860 --> 11:44.100]  McConnell to Harry Reid Nancy Pelosi and Mr. Boehner John Boehner of the
[11:44.100 --> 11:48.580]  Speaker of the House to set up the Super Congress and it is in the news as of
[11:48.580 --> 11:52.500]  yesterday that tens of millions of dollars have been paid directly to the
[11:52.500 --> 11:57.500]  12 leaders of the council who will now originate spending and cutting bills
[11:57.500 --> 12:00.340]  which is officially pretty much everything everything's tied to the
[12:00.340 --> 12:04.500]  power of the person Congress so bills don't originate now the way they have
[12:04.500 --> 12:08.620]  for 200 plus years out of any member and then are debated that they come out of
[12:08.620 --> 12:12.500]  a committee you can vote it up or down in the full House or Senate with a simple
[12:12.500 --> 12:17.580]  majority vote not large majorities like you need for most spending bills and
[12:17.580 --> 12:22.460]  there's no debate on it and there's no filibuster in the Senate I mean this is
[12:22.460 --> 12:29.100]  earth shaking type stuff that is happening right now and it's so
[12:29.100 --> 12:33.380]  incredible actually see it happening it's one thing to know that it's coming
[12:33.380 --> 12:40.340]  but now it's here and now Obama has announced and the way this has been
[12:40.340 --> 12:44.700]  spun in the Austin American statesman here where I live and in the Washington
[12:44.700 --> 12:51.780]  Post and a whole stack of news reports that all Obama's gonna decide who gets
[12:51.780 --> 12:57.260]  deported and who doesn't and he's canceled 300,000 of the latest deportations
[12:57.260 --> 13:00.380]  two years ago it came out the Associated Press that they would do these
[13:00.380 --> 13:03.900]  staged raids on meat-packing plants and facilities that weren't part of the
[13:03.900 --> 13:09.700]  insider groups in one case arrested 1,100 people plus and then took them to the
[13:09.700 --> 13:14.460]  ICE facility and gave them green cards on the spot and released them and of
[13:14.460 --> 13:19.580]  course the the parts of the border fence Bush built and then Obama continued for
[13:19.580 --> 13:24.740]  show it came out in AP and Fox as well that those were being built predominantly
[13:24.740 --> 13:29.180]  by illegal aliens I mean you can't you can't make stuff up like that it's it's
[13:29.180 --> 13:33.260]  so ridiculous so we're in the North American Union we're inside the North
[13:33.260 --> 13:36.780]  American continental security perimeter that they officially called the North
[13:36.780 --> 13:43.060]  American Union Bush signed the secret treaty in Waco, Texas with Fox of Mexico
[13:43.060 --> 13:55.580]  Cameron of Canada at the time and it's just incredible it's absolutely off the
[13:55.580 --> 14:01.980]  charts to to to see something like this happening having one of those moments
[14:01.980 --> 14:06.580]  it's not Cameron of England right now who was the prime minister guys look up
[14:06.580 --> 14:14.660]  I'm having one of those moments a prep a prime minister of Canada 2005 Paul
[14:14.660 --> 14:21.660]  Martin Paul Martin Paul Martin Martin Fox and Fox so Fox Bush and and Paul
[14:21.660 --> 14:25.940]  Martin did double check that again my memory's failing sometimes the most
[14:25.940 --> 14:29.060]  simple thing so I keep a few days ago I couldn't remember the name of the disease
[14:29.060 --> 14:35.620]  that mosquitoes can pass on malaria and then it popped in my head so we have
[14:35.620 --> 14:38.980]  launching wars and saying I don't need any stinking Congress we don't need any
[14:38.980 --> 14:46.380]  stinking badges carbon taxes environmental regulations gun gun laws
[14:46.380 --> 14:52.620]  but they're not laws now you have to review deportations focus on criminals
[14:52.620 --> 14:57.780]  so they'll decide now now the dream act and that they've tried to ram through
[14:57.780 --> 15:02.980]  and they got through in California again gives more tuition to illegals
[15:02.980 --> 15:09.740]  basically and the Bush amnesty they tried it four times and then Senator
[15:09.740 --> 15:15.940]  Sessions actually released it the the final time they tried it in 2008 they
[15:15.940 --> 15:21.260]  were unable to get it through when it was publicly debated so there was that
[15:21.260 --> 15:25.380]  news headline that the Senate bill was secret but they said trust us there's
[15:25.380 --> 15:31.380]  no amnesty and then Senator Sessions leaked it and the report he put out was
[15:31.380 --> 15:38.380]  called 20 loopholes in the immigration plan and he he went ahead and released it
[15:38.380 --> 15:43.620]  and they threatened to censure him but they really couldn't and it said not
[15:43.620 --> 15:47.780]  only was it total amnesty in a way it was true it wasn't amnesty it was it was
[15:47.780 --> 15:53.220]  a pardon it said the hundreds of thousands of felon illegals living in
[15:53.220 --> 15:58.980]  the US who were US felons that if they just signed a pledge to not commit more
[15:58.980 --> 16:06.780]  crime that they would be legalized and so this is a bipartisan traitorous
[16:06.780 --> 16:10.900]  program to basically in the United States and in citizenship as you know it
[16:10.900 --> 16:16.300]  and so they're spinning it in the media like well you know the 300,000 people
[16:16.300 --> 16:21.380]  they're just gonna you know deport the criminals if they feel like it but I
[16:21.380 --> 16:26.780]  remember Houston Chronicle articles a few years ago they reported over 200,000
[16:26.780 --> 16:30.940]  illegals released in one year out of Texas jails alone many of which were
[16:30.940 --> 16:36.260]  felons arson armed robbery I mean illegals are really above the law police
[16:36.260 --> 16:39.660]  will tell you it's been in the news I've talked to Austin prosecutors off record
[16:39.660 --> 16:43.940]  that if police do arrest the illegals for drunk driving or no ID or reckless
[16:43.940 --> 16:47.900]  driving they're given a five or ten dollar fine by the judge and then the
[16:47.900 --> 16:51.580]  sheriff's department the police department the state police are then
[16:51.580 --> 16:55.700]  reprimanded just like they said there's not a quota for tickets now it's
[16:55.700 --> 16:58.900]  admitted all over the country all these jurisdictions do have an unwritten quota
[16:58.900 --> 17:03.460]  well it's the same thing there is a unwritten rule you don't arrest the
[17:03.460 --> 17:09.620]  illegal aliens you throw the book at citizens and I told the story many times
[17:09.620 --> 17:14.060]  one night one of our IT contractors we had a problem and I had to come let them
[17:14.060 --> 17:19.620]  into the office and I and as I drove up the contractor was in handcuffs with two
[17:19.620 --> 17:23.500]  police cars around him and his driver's license was expired he hadn't gotten it
[17:23.500 --> 17:28.420]  renewed and I got out the cops bowed up and then they all three of them I knew
[17:28.420 --> 17:31.820]  who I was and oh hey we're listeners how you doing I said man well what are you
[17:31.820 --> 17:35.980]  guys doing oh well we're arresting them for no ID I was fired ID and I said I
[17:35.980 --> 17:40.420]  said but if he was an illegal alien you let him go and he goes well that's right
[17:40.420 --> 17:44.500]  but I don't care I'm retired in six months hey have you heard of my band I
[17:44.500 --> 17:48.700]  play all over thousands come out and hear us was black guy was the was the
[17:48.700 --> 17:54.820]  most senior of the three cops there and a black Austin cop a lot of you cops up
[17:54.820 --> 17:59.100]  there listen probably knowing I forget his name and I said you know this is
[17:59.100 --> 18:02.220]  wrong and I said if he was illegal you let him go and he goes yeah because the
[18:02.220 --> 18:05.820]  judge would just let him go for ten bucks and so there's no point in arrest
[18:05.820 --> 18:09.580]  in them but this is what we're supposed to do so we're arresting him and then
[18:09.580 --> 18:14.740]  they put my contractor in a car they allowed him to have it to give me his
[18:14.740 --> 18:21.140]  keys he got driven off to jail and then another squad car pulled up and another
[18:21.140 --> 18:26.700]  senior group of cops got out and they were listeners the fact the most senior
[18:26.700 --> 18:31.340]  guy was a white guy was not a bad guy but he was stuttering and hardly talk when
[18:31.340 --> 18:34.340]  I was talking to him a lot of cops may know who that is it was over here in
[18:34.340 --> 18:40.660]  South Austin and I was talking to him and I said you know police are getting
[18:40.660 --> 18:44.100]  out of control you guys are being trained to act like thugs and he goes I know but
[18:44.100 --> 18:47.740]  I'm getting out of here I'm retiring in six months my band's so popular oh you
[18:47.740 --> 18:51.300]  want you got to come see it I said you know I was just in New York and the

[18:55.460 --> 18:59.420]  telephone book and he goes you know that happened to me I was playing a big
[18:59.420 --> 19:03.420]  convention in New York just last year and I asked the officer for directions

[19:12.660 --> 19:19.740]  that selectively in forced and put an American citizen in a car and took him
[19:19.740 --> 19:23.820]  to jail and I think they took him to jail because they got all excited and
[19:23.820 --> 19:28.420]  had called it in because they saw him pull into the office park and we're
[19:28.420 --> 19:32.620]  checking it or something and just you know once they'd gotten into that alert
[19:32.620 --> 19:36.380]  mode oh yeah that was the other thing the contractor had come into the office
[19:36.380 --> 19:40.420]  and then they'd been banging on the doors and he came because I guess they
[19:40.420 --> 19:42.940]  knew it was an expired license by running the plate and they were running
[19:42.940 --> 19:49.180]  around in my office I forgot that part oh yeah the cop it was just so

[24:00.700 --> 24:13.380]  tyranny's really pretty simple the corrupt over time end up taking over a
[24:13.380 --> 24:18.900]  government selling the public on a police state in the name of safety and
[24:18.900 --> 24:22.980]  then the insider interest shut down all their competition consolidate the
[24:22.980 --> 24:28.660]  economy and the society implodes into a third world banana republic the wages of
[24:28.660 --> 24:35.140]  globalism are abject poverty and oppression and humiliation and it's not
[24:35.140 --> 24:39.220]  too late to turn this around there is a big awakening happening the question is
[24:39.220 --> 24:44.220]  is it happening fast enough to beat the tyrannical clamp down this happening
[24:44.220 --> 24:49.780]  worldwide everything we've talked about so far right on time has happened gold
[24:49.780 --> 24:56.220]  is at 1860 something bucks last time I checked and the devaluation of the dollar
[24:56.220 --> 24:59.820]  is moving forward they're holding Europe hostage for trillions more to the
[24:59.820 --> 25:05.100]  private banks or they will fully implode their economy Europe will pay the ransom
[25:05.100 --> 25:09.940]  the bankers will then implode it even faster by the way Rick Perry and we've
[25:09.940 --> 25:15.540]  been looking into this has always gotten big bank funding and I was looking
[25:15.540 --> 25:22.180]  into his Texas estate filings last night big money from the big top six banks
[25:22.180 --> 25:28.660]  and I'm working with my writers to get a report on that out by next week but
[25:28.660 --> 25:31.860]  other writers that are listening you ought to scoop us and do it all I care
[25:31.860 --> 25:36.980]  about is that the information gets out there because Rick Perry says that he
[25:36.980 --> 25:42.740]  you know thinks that the Federal Reserve is treacherous in almost treasonous
[25:42.740 --> 25:47.020]  almost treasonous really a foreign banking private group running the
[25:47.020 --> 25:50.420]  country and running into the ground by design and openly calling for world
[25:50.420 --> 25:55.260]  government and carbon taxes on every man woman and child fully financing
[25:55.260 --> 26:00.460]  Obama's campaign Goldman Sachs JP Morgan others gave four times the money
[26:00.460 --> 26:03.940]  some banks five times the money but on average four times the money that John
[26:03.940 --> 26:07.140]  McCain got and again it wasn't that John McCain was a good guy it was that
[26:07.140 --> 26:12.140]  Obama was the next horse he was the guy that they had picked to win like a Don
[26:12.140 --> 26:17.660]  King fight and so whoever gets the big banking money you know is their man and
[26:17.660 --> 26:23.060]  he just announced obviously on Saturday but already Rick Perry is getting big
[26:23.060 --> 26:27.020]  banking money the big darling even above him because he's been the race for a
[26:27.020 --> 26:32.420]  few months is Mitt Romney absolutely globalist financed just like Rand Paul's
[26:32.420 --> 26:36.180]  both of his competitors in the Republican primary and then in the main
[26:36.180 --> 26:40.740]  election for the Senate seat in Kentucky the banksters just opened the
[26:40.740 --> 26:46.660]  coffers up tens of millions flowed in with Obama of course it was close to a
[26:46.660 --> 26:51.700]  billion dollars and more than half of it from the big mega banks and then and
[26:51.700 --> 26:58.780]  that way they both own both sides of the fight that's why they're all going after
[26:58.780 --> 27:01.860]  Ron Paul but there's a zero hedge article that we've got linked up on
[27:01.860 --> 27:10.020]  infowars.com and prisonplanet.com Bank of America dead drop to Rick Perry we
[27:10.020 --> 27:14.740]  will help you out this was a few days ago and Perry was in New Hampshire it was
[27:14.740 --> 27:21.860]  caught live on C-span and you see one of the top minions of Bank of America come
[27:21.860 --> 27:29.300]  over to him and say hey it's Bank of America we will help you out total
[27:29.300 --> 27:34.140]  mobster it said should we be surprised frightened disgusted or simply say we
[27:34.140 --> 27:38.620]  knew it that the informal mixer just after Texas governor and Republican
[27:38.620 --> 27:42.900]  presidential candidate Rick Perry spoke at a politics and eggs breakfast in
[27:42.900 --> 27:47.740]  Bedford New Hampshire an unknown gentleman approaches a casual Perry like
[27:47.740 --> 27:51.540]  an Ian Fleming character out of James Bond and proceeds to dead drop the
[27:51.540 --> 27:56.620]  following Bank of America will help you out and suddenly moves on at least we
[27:56.620 --> 28:02.660]  know now who is funding what and whose interest potential future president
[28:02.660 --> 28:07.820]  Perry will be paid to defend and it looks like on the video Perry nods very
[28:07.820 --> 28:12.340]  excitedly so we'll go ahead and play that audio caught from a camera about 15
[28:12.340 --> 28:17.140]  feet away Perry doesn't know this is on camera here it is
[28:26.020 --> 28:31.380]  there you go let's let's back that up for folks again Bank of America we will
[28:31.380 --> 28:38.060]  help you out and I've been trying to look at that guy's face but he he looks
[28:38.060 --> 28:42.380]  like a well-known well-known Bank of America exact we need the media to
[28:42.380 --> 28:45.300]  dig into that and find out exactly who he is let's go ahead and play that clip
[28:45.300 --> 28:47.500]  again
[28:59.500 --> 29:06.660]  he knew how to walk right over and just get right in his ear and say Bank of
[29:06.660 --> 29:12.740]  America we will help you out and that guy's body language classic exact
[29:12.740 --> 29:17.580]  cookie cutter right out of central casting is hey I'm dominant you're
[29:17.580 --> 29:22.180]  subservient Perry we want you to be our be our minion there's the associated
[29:22.180 --> 29:28.020]  press Bank of America to cut 3,500 jobs mainly the customer service type people
[29:28.020 --> 29:30.500]  because they don't need that anymore they've got the Banker bailout money
[29:30.500 --> 29:34.940]  they've got presidents that just pay them trillions so that they then don't
[29:34.940 --> 29:40.260]  loan the public money and the government pays them interest on the money
[29:40.260 --> 29:43.420]  they're holding we went over that yesterday we're gonna come back and get
[29:43.420 --> 29:48.180]  into some of the other news and we'll also break down Obama he doesn't need

[34:20.020 --> 34:24.500]  have been laudan raid the Norway shooting government drug dealing fast
[34:24.500 --> 34:30.300]  and furious and a lot more and he is scheduled to be on today but he called
[34:30.300 --> 34:34.860]  us last night 90% chance to be on the day of not it'll be Sunday or Monday
[34:34.860 --> 34:40.100]  we're looking for Frank Serpico to be on the show later in the broadcast and
[34:40.100 --> 34:47.020]  obviously Bob Chapman is gonna be joining us you know I have thought about
[34:47.020 --> 34:52.700]  covering this I had first heard about this about a month ago and I'm I'm I'm
[34:52.700 --> 35:00.020]  still reticent just because I don't know what to think about it but I
[35:00.020 --> 35:06.380]  I may have some comment later on a report everybody sending to us out of the
[35:06.380 --> 35:11.660]  Washington Post Salon you name it have you ever had sex with Rick Perry the
[35:11.660 --> 35:17.020]  wish will add hominem attack that's what the Washington Post says and local ad
[35:17.020 --> 35:25.420]  said to run in the Austin Chronicle either this week or next week I'm not
[35:25.420 --> 35:27.940]  sure they say it's gonna run next week but next week would have come out
[35:27.940 --> 35:32.580]  yesterday I haven't read the read the publication yet and when the gentlemen
[35:32.580 --> 35:38.060]  Robert Morrow's been in contact with us for about a month and says he's heard
[35:38.060 --> 35:43.900]  from all these people that that that Rick Perry basically behaves in his words
[35:43.900 --> 35:49.500]  to me in a voicemail he's been talking to some of the staff like a porn star
[35:49.500 --> 35:55.180]  when he's on the road look we know Bill Clinton did do that type of stuff and
[35:55.180 --> 35:59.220]  anybody that reported on it got a state police visit and their legs broken or
[35:59.220 --> 36:03.780]  their brains blown out and a lot of that stuff did come out and get confirmed
[36:03.780 --> 36:08.580]  later but I've also seen a lot of rumors put out I have no doubt people are
[36:08.580 --> 36:13.100]  telling him this and I don't think the guy's lying but I you know people say
[36:13.100 --> 36:17.860]  I'm a space alien people say that you know I work for the Vatican folks I'm not
[36:17.860 --> 36:22.540]  even Catholic or they say I work for Israel you know things like that so I
[36:22.540 --> 36:27.860]  just over the years just because people say something and and someone's told him
[36:27.860 --> 36:31.220]  this doesn't necessarily make it true I mean I've lived here in Austin since
[36:31.220 --> 36:37.820]  high school since my last couple years in high school on a few years in Dallas
[36:37.820 --> 36:48.380]  and I since Rick Perry's been in for ten years all I've ever heard is about Rick
[36:48.380 --> 36:57.060]  Perry sexual escapades and I have never seen one piece of proof on it okay it
[36:57.060 --> 37:00.940]  may be there these politicians are egomaniacs on average these sellouts
[37:00.940 --> 37:05.260]  show themselves to be crazy to have no moral fiber if you'll try to forcibly
[37:05.260 --> 37:08.860]  inoculate little girls with a vaccine you know killed people in the trials
[37:08.860 --> 37:13.780]  because the drug company wants to get vaccine damage fund funds and if it
[37:13.780 --> 37:17.260]  becomes mandated by the government they'll get it so they dump a dangerous
[37:17.260 --> 37:22.020]  drug on the market knowingly and Rick Perry is the political whore out of all
[37:22.020 --> 37:25.620]  the politicians in the country chief executives in the country that they find
[37:25.620 --> 37:32.860]  who will make the call I think that's a crime a billion times worse I mean he
[37:32.860 --> 37:37.820]  has the blood of children on his hands and I've shed it it's bold statement I
[37:37.820 --> 37:44.380]  can back it up I can back it up that he got awards from a Sente Fox for giving
[37:44.380 --> 37:48.860]  state tuition to illegal aliens I can prove he had his buddies introduced the
[37:48.860 --> 37:52.340]  TSA bill and then quietly killed it himself so he could claim and he was
[37:52.340 --> 37:57.180]  for it but then still kill it I can prove that he tried to hand over 8,000
[37:57.180 --> 38:00.640]  miles of Texas roads to a foreign company I can prove he went to a
[38:00.640 --> 38:03.460]  Bilderberg group meeting and as a globalist I can prove he worked for Al
[38:03.460 --> 38:13.380]  Gore people can't even believe that so for me I just think that the the issues
[38:13.380 --> 38:17.660]  are what we know about Rick Perry and what we can prove and I said two days
[38:17.660 --> 38:21.460]  ago I said to my crew I said when this starts getting media attention these
[38:21.460 --> 38:25.020]  reports were being sent they're gonna spin it and say this guy's a Ron Paul
[38:25.020 --> 38:29.260]  supporter this is a dirty trick from Ron Paul and sure enough that's the spin
[38:29.260 --> 38:33.580]  yesterday and today so I mean I know politics ladies and gentlemen this is
[38:33.580 --> 38:38.380]  what I do I eat drink sleep it I wake up at 3 a.m. thinking about it I did last
[38:38.380 --> 38:43.860]  night for about an hour this is what I do okay I live it like an NFL football
[38:43.860 --> 38:56.140]  coach Libs breathe sleeps football and show I don't know I want to talk to this
[38:56.140 --> 38:58.700]  Robert Morrow guy a little bit more maybe I'll talk to him during the next
[38:58.700 --> 39:02.060]  break as he's been calling us quite a bit since we called him back and I need
[39:02.060 --> 39:04.340]  to get on the phone with him and maybe we'll have him on an overdrive the day
[39:04.340 --> 39:11.540]  or something to really get to the bottom of this because it's a free country I
[39:11.540 --> 39:16.820]  mean this is kind of a Larry Flint type deal Larry Frint puts out ads saying hey
[39:16.820 --> 39:22.260]  the Intel is this person's this preacher is visiting prostitutes or this just
[39:22.260 --> 39:27.980]  senator's got boyfriends or girlfriends and a lot of times it comes out a lot of
[39:27.980 --> 39:32.340]  times though then the aid to the congressperson supposedly visiting with
[39:32.340 --> 39:37.340]  you know their bones gets found you know out in the DC Park this is dangerous
[39:37.340 --> 39:44.020]  stuff let me tell you something if there is any meat and potatoes to this mr.
[39:44.020 --> 39:50.140]  Morrow better be watching his back just like I told the DC madam because this is
[39:50.140 --> 39:57.660]  dangerous this is dangerous dangerous dangerous stuff all right enough said
[39:57.660 --> 40:03.380]  about that all I know is Rick Perry's record is he is slicker than Bill
[40:03.380 --> 40:11.460]  Clinton wicker than George W. Bush more arrogant he's a bigger long-legged
[40:11.460 --> 40:20.420]  Mac Daddy is some people said about Barack Obama Pastor Manning I mean he
[40:20.420 --> 40:25.420]  talked about a long-legged Mac Daddy you talk about arrogant you talk about a
[40:25.420 --> 40:32.100]  confidence man Rick Perry is it and stinks I mean I have no doubt looking
[40:32.100 --> 40:37.260]  at his MO looking at the just the way he behaves the way he operates and the way
[40:37.260 --> 40:45.700]  I've seen him operate in public that he is a wild man and where there's smoke
[40:45.700 --> 40:50.740]  there's generally fire I mean I live here now I haven't heard over the years
[40:50.740 --> 40:56.700]  that it's women I've heard it's men that Rick and again with no proof but it's
[40:56.700 --> 41:01.780]  constant constant constant constant constant constant they've had newscast
[41:01.780 --> 41:06.580]  in Austin years ago about it's only a rumor it may be is it some dirty trick
[41:06.580 --> 41:15.180]  I don't know so that's why I pretty much stay away from all of this stuff I've
[41:15.180 --> 41:17.860]  had run-ins with Rick Perry you know he's grabbed the phone away from a
[41:17.860 --> 41:21.660]  reporter and come on the radio on record and called me a big fat hog and
[41:21.660 --> 41:25.980]  bunch of other stuff Rick Perry when I was in a restaurant one day walked over
[41:25.980 --> 41:30.860]  to the table and said I hope you have a great Thanksgiving coming up you know
[41:30.860 --> 41:39.060]  really giving me a buddy I'm Don Carleone look and I was sitting there
[41:39.060 --> 41:43.460]  you know eating my enchiladas and I looked over and he went over and sat down
[41:43.460 --> 41:47.060]  with his wife and kids I didn't pull out a camera and get in his face I lie
[41:47.060 --> 41:52.580]  people alone with their families because I want to be left alone but you know I
[41:52.580 --> 42:00.100]  have that old chivalrous chivalry idea about things in politics but he was
[42:00.100 --> 42:03.500]  really asking for it or maybe he was trying to be nice I don't know it comes
[42:03.500 --> 42:07.500]  over to the table puts his hands on the chair behind the person sitting right
[42:07.500 --> 42:11.780]  across from me looks right at me and says I want you to have a great
[42:11.780 --> 42:17.580]  Thanksgiving Alex and just put his eyebrows up and just looked at me and
[42:17.580 --> 42:24.300]  I'm going okay all right you too he wanders over to the table sits down
[42:24.300 --> 42:29.260]  with his family they were already there he got there late he went the whole
[42:29.260 --> 42:34.140]  story we're in the back room at low at Louisville Leon it means the lion
[42:34.140 --> 42:41.700]  Mexican restaurant over on East 6 or is it East 7th I forget and I was over there
[42:41.700 --> 42:45.500]  with the crew the TV crew at the time we're doing the local TV show over there
[42:45.500 --> 42:50.300]  and they go there's Rick Perry staring at you and I turn and Rick Perry's at the
[42:50.300 --> 42:56.940]  door about 15 feet away looking at me and I'm looking at him okay okay and he
[42:56.940 --> 43:01.300]  goes away and then I guess he made sure his security details I saw them that
[43:01.300 --> 43:03.980]  start milling around by the door and then he came in and did this little
[43:03.980 --> 43:14.260]  did his little thing then a Fox News host told me in confidence and I guess
[43:14.260 --> 43:18.180]  that was said no I mean I wasn't told I couldn't talk about it I said just
[43:18.180 --> 43:21.940]  don't say what host but I guess people figured that out and some other things I
[43:21.940 --> 43:27.380]  still have sources in Fox a Fox News host told me I don't know over about 14
[43:27.380 --> 43:33.620]  months ago the strangest thing Alex and he called me so the strangest thing but
[43:33.620 --> 43:37.940]  then I told the story and now that source won't give me information and won't
[43:37.940 --> 43:41.380]  come on the show you might guess who it is still likes his still sends nice
[43:41.380 --> 43:47.980]  messages but that's the end of it I guess they came down on him but he told
[43:47.980 --> 43:53.980]  me is the strangest thing Rick Perry at a tea party event in Texas I won't say
[43:53.980 --> 43:58.340]  what city pulled me aside in the green room and and got me in the corner and
[43:58.340 --> 44:03.180]  said I'm really worried about Ron Paul and Alex Jones that's who I fear I'm
[44:03.180 --> 44:09.100]  really worried I talked about it at the time I'm really worried I'm really
[44:09.100 --> 44:14.340]  worried about him all right now I'm digressing I mean why is Rick Perry
[44:14.340 --> 44:24.940]  worried about me why I don't know I guess because the governor's office
[44:24.940 --> 44:28.780]  admitted they got over 10,000 phone calls when they had a bill they tried to
[44:28.780 --> 44:33.740]  pass for the CPS could take your children for absolutely no reason and was
[44:33.740 --> 44:38.260]  gonna try to restrict homeschooling I think that freaked him out I know with
[44:38.260 --> 44:43.740]  the whole machete thing Rob do called their office to say he is the state
[44:43.740 --> 44:46.980]  funding the machete program and the governor's office runs the film
[44:46.980 --> 44:51.660]  Commission that gives state incentives to Texas films that if they're big
[44:51.660 --> 44:55.820]  budget little guys don't get any of the tax breaks in that the way it always is
[44:55.820 --> 44:59.660]  and they said of course and the lady gave the quote she's the deputy in charge
[44:59.660 --> 45:03.580]  and said of course we fund all of Robert Rodriguez's films and I said well if
[45:03.580 --> 45:06.180]  you're not letting people make other political films why are you letting them
[45:06.180 --> 45:11.540]  fund this you know our our call was to get to have tax incentives but for
[45:11.540 --> 45:14.380]  everybody producing film and that government doesn't have control of the
[45:14.380 --> 45:20.740]  content this is not East Germany under the Stasi after all and we put our
[45:20.740 --> 45:25.020]  report out and man we get a call from the governor's head of the Commission we
[45:25.020 --> 45:29.580]  get a call from his press secretary the ad press secretary and she says that is
[45:29.580 --> 45:33.140]  incorrect we're not funding this we've not released whether we're gonna fund it
[45:33.140 --> 45:37.260]  or not yet but then we found speeches of Perry saying he was funding it with
[45:37.260 --> 45:41.940]  Rod Regas and speeches he gave so so they understand the political power of
[45:41.940 --> 45:47.140]  this broadcast they felt it with the TSA they felt it on a lot of issues but
[45:47.140 --> 45:53.380]  pray for us because Rick Perry is a gangster Rick Perry is dangerous Rick
[45:53.380 --> 45:58.340]  Perry is a Republican Bill Clinton and quite frankly at the end of the day he's
[45:58.340 --> 46:03.460]  just a puppet and I've got bigger fish to fry so I'm gonna cover your record
[46:03.460 --> 46:07.820]  putting that dangerous vaccine out to the public and lying and saying that
[46:07.820 --> 46:11.620]  everybody had to take it and the deaths and all the injuries I'm gonna expose you
[46:11.620 --> 46:16.540]  on the nap to superhighways I'm gonna expose you on your real record but at
[46:16.540 --> 46:26.020]  the end of the day I just don't know I just have a bad feeling about all this
[46:26.020 --> 46:32.620]  sex stuff I really do I mean I think that we have enough issues here we have
[46:32.620 --> 46:37.580]  more than enough to let us know who Rick Perry really is and I think that if
[46:37.580 --> 46:42.700]  people don't come forward that have been having sex with Rick Perry or or they
[46:42.700 --> 46:48.340]  may put phonies in there who then turn to say they're lying later to make him
[46:48.340 --> 46:55.020]  look like a victim I mean that you know there's a lot of do I mean remember it
[46:55.020 --> 47:00.760]  was Carl Rove who got Rick Perry to switch from the Republican from the
[47:00.760 --> 47:06.540]  Democrat to Republican Party it was Carl Rove who got him to switch from Al
[47:06.540 --> 47:12.660]  Gore's minion apprentice to to to Rove's apprentice I guess what 1990s when he
[47:12.660 --> 47:20.300]  switched and Carl Rove on record you planted bugs in his own office to blame
[47:20.300 --> 47:27.180]  his political rivals in fact that was on a Perry campaign he did that and Carl
[47:27.180 --> 47:30.860]  Rove has moved back they've got this fake
[47:31.020 --> 47:36.020]  media event going that that they don't like each other and there's a rivalry
[47:36.020 --> 47:39.540]  and Perry doesn't like Bush I told you a year ago that was going to start being
[47:39.540 --> 47:42.580]  announced because I was told that by high-level political operatives in Texas
[47:42.580 --> 47:47.060]  who were on the national stage and I know the street Carl Rove has moved back
[47:47.060 --> 47:51.420]  to and I know that Carl Rove's giggling and laughing to his buddies about the
[47:51.420 --> 47:55.420]  scam they're running but Carl Rove is running the Rick Perry campaign from
[47:55.420 --> 48:02.740]  behind the scenes and told Perry to you know to do the ruse of I pledge not to
[48:02.740 --> 48:07.900]  run in 2012 because I love Texas and they had Limbaugh come out and say oh
[48:07.900 --> 48:12.220]  I'm drafting you Perry you've got to run and all the other Republican leadership
[48:12.220 --> 48:17.900]  doing this he's the guy they want a lot of big corporate interest have given to
[48:17.900 --> 48:22.820]  Romney but the guy they really want is Rick Perry that's why you see the
[48:22.820 --> 48:26.660]  national media before even announcing Rick Perry's the leader Rick Perry can
[48:26.660 --> 48:33.580]  win Rick Perry's the second coming of Ronald Reagan but I've already talked
[48:33.580 --> 48:38.140]  about this too much we may cover today or Sunday I'm gonna work on it I want to
[48:38.140 --> 48:42.860]  get some into the economy right now and I want to hear from you Obama is
[48:42.860 --> 48:47.860]  legalizing at least 300,000 current deportees that are in in government
[48:47.860 --> 48:51.700]  facilities and he's saying he's just gonna let him go but the media's spinning
[48:51.700 --> 48:55.260]  that well he's you know he's not going to deport illegals it may be just the
[48:55.260 --> 49:01.380]  felons so you know he he basically can't get Congress to pass amnesty so
[49:01.380 --> 49:04.820]  anybody who ever get if the board patrol does its job remember the board
[49:04.820 --> 49:07.740]  patrol came out a few months ago and said we've been ordered to only arrest
[49:07.740 --> 49:12.300]  illegals as part of photo ops when the media sent down here we're not supposed
[49:12.300 --> 49:16.220]  to arrest him anymore and sheriffs have come out in Arizona and Texas said yeah
[49:16.220 --> 49:21.820]  the board patrols told us this as well well here it is officially here is the
[49:21.820 --> 49:27.260]  president saying well we got 300 and cuss 300,000 in custody right now we're
[49:27.260 --> 49:33.740]  going to just release them and they spent it like well you know the
[49:33.740 --> 49:37.780]  president's gonna decide now he's not gonna follow immigration law he's gonna
[49:37.780 --> 49:43.500]  decide he's gonna launch wars without Congress new gun control without a law
[49:43.500 --> 49:51.140]  he's gonna pass carbon taxes without a law put it into place he's going to
[49:51.140 --> 49:56.260]  restrict gun importations without laws I mean there's a we've got a super
[49:56.260 --> 50:00.380]  congress now that the president controls with a veto that's taken away the
[50:00.380 --> 50:04.380]  power of the purse from the general House and Senate I mean this is all off
[50:04.380 --> 50:09.940]  the charts and there's a bunch of other examples of this I mean we're living in
[50:09.940 --> 50:15.580]  unbelievable times of true treason of true treachery this is treachery this is
[50:15.580 --> 50:23.220]  treason it it meets the threshold and surpasses it wildly and the fact is once
[50:23.220 --> 50:26.820]  they start just completely ignoring the Constitution separation of powers
[50:26.820 --> 50:31.140]  bill of rights declaration of independence once they complete I mean
[50:31.140 --> 50:34.620]  they've been eating around the edges and trying to violate it here and there now
[50:34.620 --> 50:39.740]  they're just warped speed like captain Picard says warp one engage I mean
[50:39.740 --> 50:44.180]  Obama said okay we're at half impulse power prepare to go to warp nine yes sir
[50:44.180 --> 50:49.300]  captain you know I mean Bill Clinton George Bush they were they were violating

[54:43.060 --> 54:53.020]  issues that we've mentioned or raised here is 800-259-9231 800-259-9231 I
[54:53.020 --> 54:57.860]  have not given up the source of that Rick Perry information and we obviously
[54:57.860 --> 55:00.900]  we've had over the years four or five different or actually six different
[55:00.900 --> 55:06.260]  Fox TV host on I didn't even reveal that it was a television host well last
[55:06.260 --> 55:11.260]  year that said that Rick Perry fears Alex Jones and Ron Paul but I think now
[55:11.260 --> 55:14.380]  that we're in the election and that I did report on that last year and I am a
[55:14.380 --> 55:19.300]  media outlet known for our accuracy no matter how wild stuff sounds that I
[55:19.300 --> 55:25.860]  think that's newsworthy that Rick Perry fears Ron Paul but that's the problem
[55:25.860 --> 55:29.860]  once people know you're in the media they say this is in confidence right I
[55:29.860 --> 55:35.220]  had a media national figure last night on the phone with me feeling I'm telling
[55:35.220 --> 55:40.380]  you this in confidence right right Alex and I'm like yes yes it's in
[55:40.380 --> 55:48.900]  confidence and I go well can I then talk about what you just told me what can I
[55:48.900 --> 55:52.540]  say I don't want to give it away you know with this other person they said no
[55:52.540 --> 55:57.820]  you say it's a host just don't say who I know you have a lot of us on but you
[55:57.820 --> 56:02.620]  know you can say Rick Perry said this and I said are you sure are you sure I can
[56:02.620 --> 56:10.060]  say that yes you can say that and then I say it there's a big fracas over so a
[56:10.060 --> 56:13.260]  lot of times I'm told stuff and then I don't even want to come on air and tell
[56:13.260 --> 56:23.620]  you what I've been told because it's just too bizarre Rick Perry 14 months ago
[56:23.620 --> 56:27.540]  at a tea party event coming up and saying don't tell anybody this is off
[56:27.540 --> 56:31.940]  record but I'm I'm really fear there's only two people Ron Paul Alex Jones and
[56:31.940 --> 56:35.980]  at the time he also mentioned Deborah Medina just any type of true
[56:35.980 --> 56:43.660]  constitutional challenge to what they're doing toll free number to join us

[01:02:26.020 --> 01:02:30.380]  is skyrocketing because of global currency devaluations not just the
[01:02:30.380 --> 01:02:34.300]  dollar every currency going down except for the Swiss franc because of the only
[01:02:34.300 --> 01:02:39.820]  truly sovereign anti-globalist country left on earth that has not been
[01:02:39.820 --> 01:02:44.340]  completely taken over by these criminals and it's so elementary Ted you've got
[01:02:44.340 --> 01:02:49.900]  gold at the 1770 level that's what it's marketed into that's what you paid for
[01:02:49.900 --> 01:02:54.100]  it basically at that level in the market and now it's at 18 you know 40
[01:02:54.100 --> 01:02:59.820]  something was 1860 something just turbo charging JP Morgan saying they see
[01:02:59.820 --> 01:03:05.540]  2500 is their prediction or quote higher by December now is the time to move
[01:03:05.540 --> 01:03:08.900]  into gold and silver ladies and gentlemen and I know you've got a lot of
[01:03:08.900 --> 01:03:12.300]  silver you bought at the lower price you can still pass on the savings you've
[01:03:12.300 --> 01:03:15.380]  got a lot of gold you bought in the last few weeks you can now pass on those
[01:03:15.380 --> 01:03:19.860]  savings when the people call they've got to ask for the radio specials there's a
[01:03:19.860 --> 01:03:24.780]  long list of goodies there where you're going to get lost leader pricing that

[01:03:42.380 --> 01:03:48.020]  got it being delivered and so they will pitch what they have on hand and Ted

[01:07:23.820 --> 01:07:28.140]  overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the

[01:08:26.500 --> 01:08:29.980]  going to your phone calls here in a moment but but Paul Watson reported on
[01:08:29.980 --> 01:08:36.300]  this a couple days ago and it's linked up on drudgereport.com right now it's
[01:08:36.300 --> 01:08:41.260]  official media ignoring Ron Paul and I wanted to just show the prison planet
[01:08:41.260 --> 01:08:46.460]  dot TV viewers this and direct radio listeners over to drudgereport.com
[01:08:46.460 --> 01:08:51.060]  or info wars.com to see this for themselves but there is the rankings in
[01:08:51.060 --> 01:08:55.700]  a deep Pew Research Center project for excellence in journalism analysis of
[01:08:55.700 --> 01:09:02.500]  the amount of media coverage that they put into a computer system and data
[01:09:02.500 --> 01:09:07.460]  collating system of how much coverage different presidential level politicians
[01:09:07.460 --> 01:09:14.220]  get Barack Obama it's 220% on the graph Mitt Romney 120%
[01:09:14.220 --> 01:09:25.140]  Newt Gennrich another top globalist 118% Michelle Bachman 115% Donald Trump an
[01:09:25.140 --> 01:09:32.460]  absolute joke gets 95% Sarah Palin right at 90% Tim Palente who's out of the
[01:09:32.460 --> 01:09:41.020]  race gets right at 70% John Huntsman about 42% Rick Perry because he just got
[01:09:41.020 --> 01:09:49.140]  in he is right at about 38% and Ron Paul at 33% compared to 220 for Barack
[01:09:49.140 --> 01:09:55.500]  Obama or 124 Mitt Romney so there you go I mean you could just watch and and see
[01:09:55.500 --> 01:09:59.140]  that that's the case and when they do cover him it's to say he cannot win he
[01:09:59.140 --> 01:10:03.660]  cannot win and there's rumors that he may not be a doctor like his son there's
[01:10:03.660 --> 01:10:09.860]  rumors he may roast black children in his basement with a pointed hat on all
[01:10:09.860 --> 01:10:16.100]  under the control of BLZ Bob with dancing goblins and yes he killed Kennedy
[01:10:16.100 --> 01:10:21.620]  and Lincoln and Jesus and he sunk the Lusitania and he may have been the one
[01:10:21.620 --> 01:10:26.140]  that killed the Kraken not Medusa yes Ron Paul's the reason there's a drought
[01:10:26.140 --> 01:10:34.100]  in Texas Ron Paul has bad breath Ron Paul is meany Ron Paul is too old Ron Paul

[01:11:14.660 --> 01:11:19.740]  aliens will attack the biggest newspaper in England and in Europe that's how
[01:11:19.740 --> 01:11:21.980]  they communicate with each other in Europe is English it's the world language
[01:11:21.980 --> 01:11:26.380]  for folks that don't get taught English and public schools are in the US a part
[01:11:26.380 --> 01:11:30.300]  of the Balkanization program pay your carbon taxes to Al Gore space aliens will
[01:11:30.300 --> 01:11:36.260]  attack a NASA program funded by NASA's planetary science division this is the
[01:11:36.260 --> 01:11:40.580]  London Guardian our article breaks it down but here's London Guardian aliens
[01:11:40.580 --> 01:11:45.180]  may destroy humanity protect other civilizations say scientist and it says
[01:11:45.180 --> 01:11:48.460]  humans are parasites and evil you've seen the children's cartoons they
[01:11:48.460 --> 01:11:52.140]  produce where it shows humans blasting off into space and aliens kill us because
[01:11:52.140 --> 01:11:56.820]  we're a parasite I mean they're telling you you're bad you have no rights hate
[01:11:56.820 --> 01:12:03.620]  yourself and so now NASA is coming out and saying a NASA funded university and
[01:12:03.620 --> 01:12:07.980]  saying that we've got to pay the carbon tax or aliens are going to kill us
[01:12:07.980 --> 01:12:13.740]  ladies and gentlemen I'm not joking you heard me right it may not rank as the
[01:12:13.740 --> 01:12:16.380]  most compelling reason to curb greenhouse gases but reducing our
[01:12:16.380 --> 01:12:20.100]  emissions might just save humanity from a preempt of an alien attack scientist
[01:12:20.100 --> 01:12:24.220]  claim according to London Guardian report a new study conducted by researchers
[01:12:24.220 --> 01:12:30.620]  at NASA's planetary science division postates that green ETS literal green
[01:12:30.620 --> 01:12:34.860]  little men might get angry at Bubba driving his gas-gruzzling SUV and
[01:12:34.860 --> 01:12:38.340]  respond by whipping humankind up the face of the earth to protect other
[01:12:38.340 --> 01:12:44.580]  civilizations from carbon dioxide that plants breathe the plants rest I mean
[01:12:44.580 --> 01:12:48.940]  you just can't make this up ladies and gentlemen I go to birthday parties for
[01:12:48.940 --> 01:12:52.820]  my children's friends and their friends and these these families come over and
[01:12:52.820 --> 01:12:57.020]  they go Alex my child goes to public school I'm pulling her out every time
[01:12:57.020 --> 01:13:00.540]  we drive by a building site my dog my six-year-old daughter breaks down crying
[01:13:00.540 --> 01:13:03.900]  saying the earth is dying I mean this is what they're and meanwhile the
[01:13:03.900 --> 01:13:06.860]  globalists don't care about the environment they're not actually doing
[01:13:06.860 --> 01:13:11.580]  anything about chickens with alligator
[01:13:11.580 --> 01:13:17.300]  alligator snouts did you know what splicing animals does I mean it gives
[01:13:17.300 --> 01:13:21.300]  rise to superviruses you know how they test to see that a genetic mutation has
[01:13:21.300 --> 01:13:26.460]  been successful in a gene and a cell they've changed they put a in every this
[01:13:26.460 --> 01:13:32.340]  is the main test they do they put a antibiotic resistance in it and then
[01:13:32.340 --> 01:13:36.500]  they test antibiotics on to see if it kills the cells and then there's big
[01:13:36.500 --> 01:13:39.940]  studies out showing that's giving rise to the antibiotic resistance did you have
[01:13:39.940 --> 01:13:44.100]  any idea that there's thousands of companies splicing everything randomly
[01:13:44.100 --> 01:13:47.980]  and how deadly dangerous that is oh but let's not worry about that or toxic
[01:13:47.980 --> 01:13:53.260]  waste dumping or nuclear power plants five of them blow up each one bigger than
[01:13:53.260 --> 01:13:58.020]  Chernobyl total meltdown masses radiation raining down the US EPA just
[01:13:58.020 --> 01:14:03.020]  raises the level of radiation what they say safe from 1000 to 100,000 times what
[01:14:03.020 --> 01:14:07.660]  previously was I mean real environmental problems that are actually affecting us
[01:14:07.660 --> 01:14:10.540]  but we're not taught by the establishment to worry about that that
[01:14:10.540 --> 01:14:13.420]  leading environmentalists who are globalists like George Monbiot they
[01:14:13.420 --> 01:14:18.460]  call for global government and say this radiation is good Chernobyl changed my
[01:14:18.460 --> 01:14:23.700]  mind excuse me Fukushima changed my mind was this headline in the Guardian
[01:14:23.700 --> 01:14:28.740]  about nuclear power and you read it you know this is crazy no they're just
[01:14:28.740 --> 01:14:34.620]  throwing it in your face they're normalizing bizarreness so okay I'm
[01:14:34.620 --> 01:14:38.660]  gonna shut up go to your calls cuz Sarpakos coming up I just I just there's
[01:14:38.660 --> 01:14:44.300]  no end to this anymore there's no end and they are teaching schoolchildren that
[01:14:44.300 --> 01:14:49.900]  aliens are gonna kill us if you don't pay Lord Rothschild and Rockefeller and
[01:14:49.900 --> 01:14:54.220]  Obama and Clinton and Gore they all own part of the big climate exchange in
[01:14:54.220 --> 01:14:58.100]  Chicago and the one in London just just type in Rothschild's own climate
[01:14:58.100 --> 01:15:01.900]  exchange you'll get BBC news how gracious they are to let us pay a money to
[01:15:01.900 --> 01:15:05.180]  breathe I mean it's and they just sit back laughing while they've got giant
[01:15:05.180 --> 01:15:08.820]  yachts and private trains and helicopters and jets and palaces everywhere and
[01:15:08.820 --> 01:15:11.820]  they're they're carbon footprint in some cases there's thousands of times the
[01:15:11.820 --> 01:15:16.220]  average person and then that they actually lecture don't take hot baths
[01:15:16.220 --> 01:15:19.580]  you know we get a maid service over to do our laundry when we get behind and

[01:15:32.380 --> 01:15:35.820]  chemicals on us but do you know about genetic engineering and the eyes just
[01:15:35.820 --> 01:15:40.780]  rolled I mean I mean look you thought I'm joking IBM unveils chip that mimics

[01:24:32.860 --> 01:24:37.700]  what caused this to begin with is the girl wanted to go to the regular school
[01:24:37.700 --> 01:24:42.460]  so they tricked the mom and said that vaccines are required okay and she took
[01:24:42.460 --> 01:24:47.380]  the vaccines and she had a bad reaction so then that's how they put her on as
[01:24:47.380 --> 01:24:51.820]  other medication to you know she's the mom went to go get help well that's the
[01:24:51.820 --> 01:24:54.700]  thing they lie and say it's the law to go to school you got to take it just like

[01:25:52.620 --> 01:25:56.420]  fast I just got a real quick question here and you said a week or so ago that
[01:25:56.420 --> 01:26:01.340]  or under one of a couple shows ago that uh Rick Perry already you know has
[01:26:01.340 --> 01:26:05.740]  pretty much knelt to the builder burgers and stuff now is this gonna be the
[01:26:05.740 --> 01:26:10.980]  same type of thing as like when in 07 or 08 when no Obama was seen into those
[01:26:10.980 --> 01:26:15.460]  uh Virginia you know into the builder burger meetings in Virginia yes we knew
[01:26:15.460 --> 01:26:19.260]  Obama was in there we'd videotaped the sacred service going in with him and
[01:26:19.260 --> 01:26:23.020]  Hillary our sources said yes he's inside and we called all the national
[01:26:23.020 --> 01:26:28.020]  media who at the time was running around and this is all on film in my film
[01:26:28.020 --> 01:26:32.140]  Obama deception the national media is running around saying where is Obama
[01:26:32.140 --> 01:26:36.020]  where is Obama and we're like here he is right here remember he disappeared for a
[01:26:36.020 --> 01:26:39.900]  day with Hillary we're like here they are and the media is like yeah we know
[01:26:39.900 --> 01:26:44.100]  where he is we're just playing along that we don't know to show the control
[01:26:44.100 --> 01:26:48.860]  they have and absolutely they go and present themselves to the builder burger
[01:26:48.860 --> 01:26:53.380]  group and if they swear their allegiance then they get kicked upstairs to the
[01:26:53.380 --> 01:26:58.300]  prime ministership or the presidency that's pretty much what's gonna be the
[01:26:58.300 --> 01:27:02.420]  end result between Obama and Rick Perry then they're in pretty much decide who's
[01:27:02.420 --> 01:27:07.140]  gonna know which one they want and then that's right Rick Perry Obama have all
[01:27:07.140 --> 01:27:10.980]  gone in before the British and Dutch royalty the Rothschilds the Rockefellers
[01:27:10.980 --> 01:27:18.220]  all of them and literally sit there and pledge themselves to them and it's just

[01:27:46.300 --> 01:27:50.540]  comments and a quick question when are you going to have archives of your radio
[01:27:50.540 --> 01:27:55.580]  program because sometimes I may miss it and I would like to you know get an
[01:27:55.580 --> 01:28:00.780]  archive of it also I do have you streamed from my website so other people can
[01:28:00.780 --> 01:28:06.580]  hear and I also want to know what do you know about Sarah Palin Herman Kane and
[01:28:06.580 --> 01:28:11.740]  the last the last but not least Facebook seems to be shutting down pages like
[01:28:11.740 --> 01:28:15.500]  myself that puts things up there similar to what you're saying and then
[01:28:15.500 --> 01:28:20.460]  sometimes I put your videos up there and I put on Rick Perry's information on
[01:28:20.460 --> 01:28:25.580]  the Republican on Facebook and I'm being hit like with fiery dots from the pits
[01:28:25.580 --> 01:28:31.740]  of hell they don't like the Rick Perry situation and tell me let me try to
[01:28:31.740 --> 01:28:34.140]  answer those questions because that's a lot of them and again thank you for the
[01:28:34.140 --> 01:28:40.300]  prayers well there were so many first off there's a free archive if you go to
[01:28:40.300 --> 01:28:45.100]  any article on infoworks.com you'll see a YouTube symbol a Facebook symbol you'll
[01:28:45.100 --> 01:28:50.860]  see an I symbol and that's got the archive there and then you can also go
[01:28:50.860 --> 01:28:55.180]  down to the bottom of infoworks.com there's another archive when we updated
[01:28:55.180 --> 01:28:59.980]  the site a few months ago I noticed that that updating system had been broken and
[01:28:59.980 --> 01:29:04.980]  I told the IT people to fix it I don't know if they have is the archive system
[01:29:04.980 --> 01:29:09.060]  updating again or no because we are a radio show I would think that think that
[01:29:09.060 --> 01:29:13.660]  an archive of that the system is not broken for subscribers at prisonplanet.tv

[01:35:07.500 --> 01:35:13.820]  dollar notes were silver certificates we could exchange them for silver and now
[01:35:13.820 --> 01:35:18.940]  the paper they're written on there it's not worth it you remember that yes I do
[01:35:18.940 --> 01:35:26.740]  all right well in September 11 1959 I joined the police force in New York City
[01:35:26.740 --> 01:35:32.740]  and found out there was widespread corruption I was working in uniform and
[01:35:32.740 --> 01:35:39.660]  I just noticed that the pharmacist was shaking down motorists now I want to say
[01:35:39.660 --> 01:35:46.540]  at the onset there are lots of honest cops out there the only problem is even
[01:35:46.540 --> 01:35:51.620]  today when they want to report corruption nobody wants to hear about it
[01:35:51.620 --> 01:35:57.020]  and they downgrade statistics so they can tell you that you know the crime
[01:35:57.020 --> 01:36:03.620]  rage is down then I went on the cover and I found out they weren't only shaking
[01:36:03.620 --> 01:36:09.060]  down motorists they were shaking down drug dealers my superiors were not
[01:36:09.060 --> 01:36:14.700]  interested because most were getting bears off the top I went to the New York
[01:36:14.700 --> 01:36:22.700]  Times and on February 1 1971 I was shot pulling blank in the head on a drug
[01:36:22.700 --> 01:36:31.900]  raid where I had a police officer back up not more than five feet away and even
[01:36:31.900 --> 01:36:39.580]  I had a bullet in my head I was able to return fire and hit the suspect but they
[01:36:39.580 --> 01:36:48.980]  let him get away out the back window and the movie gives a wrong impression that
[01:36:48.980 --> 01:36:54.020]  Pacino couldn't get his gun in the door that was a nine millimeter I was the
[01:36:54.020 --> 01:36:59.540]  first cop in New York City to carry one it took them 25 years to catch up I had
[01:36:59.540 --> 01:37:05.980]  a 38 special I practically had it in the deal with stomach because I hit the
[01:37:05.980 --> 01:37:11.060]  door with the chain and I put my arm in there and he was pushing from the back
[01:37:11.060 --> 01:37:15.700]  and I turned to say what the hell you wait for give me a hand and when I turn
[01:37:15.700 --> 01:37:23.140]  back he fired blank blank hit me in the head and fortunately his gun jammed he
[01:37:23.140 --> 01:37:30.220]  had an automatic otherwise I wouldn't be talking to you today and then they had
[01:37:30.220 --> 01:37:37.700]  the movie came out and I was retired first on a disability pension which
[01:37:37.700 --> 01:37:43.580]  gave me freedom to travel the world which I did and one of the first things I
[01:37:43.580 --> 01:37:52.260]  did on my agent's suggestion was to go first class to Europe now I never did
[01:37:52.260 --> 01:37:59.260]  anything first class in my life my both my grandfathers were coal miners and we
[01:37:59.260 --> 01:38:05.380]  were poor and that's why I'm sick is the airways today they're talking about the
[01:38:05.380 --> 01:38:08.620]  starving kids I'd like to know what they're doing with the money they're
[01:38:08.620 --> 01:38:12.980]  giving them instead of the crop that they're eating and not eating whole
[01:38:12.980 --> 01:38:19.660]  food they're eating junk food but that's another issue so traveling first class
[01:38:19.660 --> 01:38:25.260]  people didn't believe that a guy dressed like me could be first class and they
[01:38:25.260 --> 01:38:32.460]  kept telling me to go back to your class and I said what class is that and I said
[01:38:32.460 --> 01:38:40.300]  tourist, storage and I said listen you may think I'm poor on the stairs but you
[01:38:40.300 --> 01:38:47.700]  don't have any class at all and then the captain found out that oh I was
[01:38:47.700 --> 01:38:54.300]  typical and invited me to his table but I graciously declined I already found what
[01:38:54.300 --> 01:38:59.500]  the upper class was all about you know absolutely spinning all that
[01:38:59.500 --> 01:39:05.300]  when I was a kid I had patches on my pants the only patches you see on pants
[01:39:05.300 --> 01:39:11.060]  today is when people pay extra money to pretend that they're poor and the
[01:39:11.060 --> 01:39:16.180]  difference between what happened in the depression and what's happening now is
[01:39:16.180 --> 01:39:22.100]  back then before the depression poor people weren't wearing designer jeans
[01:39:22.100 --> 01:39:26.740]  and sneakers so when they get hit now they're not gonna know what hit them
[01:39:26.740 --> 01:39:32.940]  because they don't know what poor is like I lived abroad for 10 years I was
[01:39:32.940 --> 01:39:36.980]  actually living in Switzerland for a year and a half where I might have still
[01:39:36.980 --> 01:39:43.300]  been there as the movie says but I was graciously run out by no other than our
[01:39:43.300 --> 01:39:50.140]  FBI where I started getting my first impressions about what the FBI does they
[01:39:50.140 --> 01:39:55.900]  wanted me to come back to New York I was actually pursued through the snow with
[01:39:55.900 --> 01:40:03.020]  my dog and my clothes under my hand and I fled to Germany where I got a camper
[01:40:03.020 --> 01:40:10.780]  trailer a small Volkswagen bus and I traveled throughout New York and and I
[01:40:10.780 --> 01:40:17.660]  found a spot in Holland and from there my base I traveled all over the world
[01:40:17.660 --> 01:40:24.620]  and before that I've been to Asia the East and Russia and when I got back to the
[01:40:24.620 --> 01:40:32.180]  States I figured I spoke more of the world than I did of the United States so I
[01:40:32.180 --> 01:40:37.380]  bought myself another little camper and I traveled all through the United States
[01:40:37.380 --> 01:40:43.820]  and I saw how the real people live the workers and the farmers the people that
[01:40:43.820 --> 01:40:48.780]  put food on our table and the rich people that abused them and wouldn't know how the
[01:40:48.780 --> 01:40:55.620]  hell to cook up how to grow a potato and yet they want to look down on the working class
[01:40:55.620 --> 01:41:00.540]  Frank Serpico is our guest and his handset broke so he's joining us via
[01:41:00.540 --> 01:41:05.900]  speakerphone for listeners out there Frank Serpico of course the legendary
[01:41:05.900 --> 01:41:12.580]  New York City detective who wouldn't go on the take and thanks to his work much
[01:41:12.580 --> 01:41:17.780]  of that corruption did end up coming out you know sir when I was going over
[01:41:17.780 --> 01:41:24.460]  your blog your website Frank Serpico.com I saw a lot of your comments
[01:41:24.460 --> 01:41:29.100]  about Fast and Furious the ATF caught shipping guns in the Mexico I saw your
[01:41:29.100 --> 01:41:36.100]  comments about yes bin Laden is dead or is he I mean I am one of my
[01:41:36.100 --> 01:41:39.780]  producers talking to you said you were bringing up globalism what is your view
[01:41:39.780 --> 01:41:45.500]  on the big banking cartels like Wells Fargo and Wacovia last year that got
[01:41:45.500 --> 01:41:51.180]  caught in two years laundering 376 billion dollars of narcotics money and
[01:41:51.180 --> 01:41:55.460]  actually owning and leasing and running the drug aircraft themselves and the
[01:41:55.460 --> 01:41:58.380]  fact that they didn't get any trouble what's your view on the drug war because
[01:41:58.380 --> 01:42:11.300]  from my research it's like alcohol prohibition it's all been yes and 9-11
[01:42:11.300 --> 01:42:17.140]  the biggest crime scene in the world and world history Giuliani had it cleaned
[01:42:17.140 --> 01:42:27.220]  up and where we sent the metal to he was landed by England and he appoints his
[01:42:27.220 --> 01:42:35.540]  driver Bernie Carrick you know they formed their own law firm which is I
[01:42:35.540 --> 01:42:44.900]  think called the Giuliani associates Giuliani partners yes right and he had a
[01:42:44.900 --> 01:42:50.340]  quite a few assorted characters on there one of them Bernie Carrick who later
[01:42:50.340 --> 01:42:57.420]  got indicted another guy tomorrow from a system director in charge of the FBI New
[01:42:57.420 --> 01:43:05.860]  York office and the inspector in charge 9-11 how's my reception it's great
[01:43:05.860 --> 01:43:11.140]  mr. Cerbercoe bottom line are you saying the 9-11 official story stinks
[01:43:11.140 --> 01:43:20.500]  does but if I can go on one of them one of his team from Giuliani partners who
[01:43:20.500 --> 01:43:26.180]  was the inspector in charge 9-11 admitted taking six artifacts from
[01:43:26.180 --> 01:43:34.260]  ground zero as memoirs and no action was ever taken by the FBI and then he had
[01:43:34.260 --> 01:43:43.380]  another character mr. Alan Plaka accused of molesting I know that's my senior
[01:43:43.380 --> 01:43:48.860]  my senior Alan Plaka accused of molesting numerous children and covering
[01:43:48.860 --> 01:43:55.460]  up on the station in the church another one of his all partners and and then the
[01:43:55.460 --> 01:44:01.740]  firm said that Giuliani believed that Alan Plaka was unjustly accused and the
[01:44:01.740 --> 01:44:07.740]  firm has no plans to dismiss him and then another one of his clients and
[01:44:07.740 --> 01:44:12.740]  admitted drug smuggler and millionaire founder of companies that perform
[01:44:12.740 --> 01:44:20.140]  electronic information and it just goes on and on and then mr. Giuliani with his
[01:44:20.140 --> 01:44:26.540]  firm goes to Mexico do you remember that yes sir and I understand as a detective
[01:44:26.540 --> 01:44:31.140]  you're giving us some background in some of those unsorted players that are
[01:44:31.140 --> 01:44:35.540]  involved but bottom line why are you saying 9-11 the attacks themselves
[01:44:35.540 --> 01:44:42.860]  you're saying that that stinks you have questions about it if they were to
[01:44:42.860 --> 01:44:48.900]  listen you know I'm in touch with a lot of I don't like the term whistleblowers
[01:44:48.900 --> 01:44:55.380]  I like to call them lap lighters you know federal agents you know we have the
[01:44:55.380 --> 01:45:01.060]  equipment to prevent anything we could be the safest country in the world the
[01:45:01.060 --> 01:45:06.820]  problem is we have incompetence at the top and as you say who knows what deals
[01:45:06.820 --> 01:45:12.820]  they're making with the world bank and I don't want to get into that because I
[01:45:12.820 --> 01:45:17.580]  don't want to implicate other people but let me ask you this what do you think
[01:45:17.580 --> 01:45:22.420]  about Frank what do you think about building 7 falling in that's a good
[01:45:22.420 --> 01:45:32.220]  point because mr. Giuliani opened up his command center there and he started a
[01:45:32.220 --> 01:45:41.580]  lot of fuel there and his director of emergency management I think his name
[01:45:41.580 --> 01:45:53.540]  was Jerome HRHU HAUER I think he advised Giuliani not to start there because it was
[01:45:53.540 --> 01:46:00.900]  vulnerable due to the previous attack on the world center Giuliani overruled him
[01:46:00.900 --> 01:46:06.820]  and then he put down erroneous information saying that he followed his
[01:46:06.820 --> 01:46:13.060]  director's advice and another thing it's not only what happened but in the
[01:46:13.060 --> 01:46:19.460]  aftermath or how it happened I don't know if your audience knows that before
[01:46:19.460 --> 01:46:27.500]  9-11 it was found that the radio transmitters were old and in awful they
[01:46:27.500 --> 01:46:41.340]  were deficient so what happened they made a deal it was what they call they
[01:46:41.340 --> 01:46:46.100]  made a deal with water roller in a no-fit contract right sure the radios didn't
[01:46:46.100 --> 01:46:53.180]  work right 33 million dollars and they were implemented early 2001 and they
[01:46:53.180 --> 01:46:59.380]  were recalled in March 2001 because a probationary firefighter called for
[01:46:59.380 --> 01:47:05.060]  health at a house fire and he couldn't couldn't be picked up by others at the
[01:47:05.060 --> 01:47:14.380]  scene so the problem is there were 343
[01:47:14.380 --> 01:47:20.940]  firefighters that when their chief told them to evacuate the building they
[01:47:20.940 --> 01:47:27.620]  couldn't be heard and Giuliani said no that was just they didn't want to leave
[01:47:27.620 --> 01:47:34.460]  they wanted to do that job and save people so what I'm saying is I guess
[01:47:34.460 --> 01:47:41.300]  what was said well by Peter Stuyvesant well the character that plays Peter
[01:47:41.300 --> 01:47:47.260]  Stuyvesant in Nicobarca holiday was the Peter Stuyvesant was the first governor
[01:47:47.260 --> 01:47:56.700]  of New York he said government one in all part of the nature of racket they
[01:47:56.700 --> 01:48:03.620]  become partners in crime and ultimately annihilate the civilization over which
[01:48:03.620 --> 01:48:10.860]  they preside and I couldn't agree more fully than that Frank Serpicoe legendary
[01:48:10.860 --> 01:48:18.420]  New York detective who exposed the fact that the city itself the establishment
[01:48:18.420 --> 01:48:26.900]  was basically skimming off the top of the drug trade Frank we've seen CIA
[01:48:26.900 --> 01:48:30.940]  hearings in Congress in the late 90s admitting government drug dealing crack
[01:48:30.940 --> 01:48:36.780]  cocaine we've seen the Pulitzer prize-winning work of Gary Webb who
[01:48:36.780 --> 01:48:44.220]  them was shot twice in the head they ruled it suicide we've seen the CIA
[01:48:44.220 --> 01:48:49.860]  aircraft full of cocaine crashing in Mexico now we have Wells Fargo and this
[01:48:49.860 --> 01:48:53.580]  is in Bloomberg AP you name it for new listeners laundering hundreds of
[01:48:53.580 --> 01:48:56.580]  billions of dollars of drug money being caught and not getting in trouble
[01:48:56.580 --> 01:48:59.460]  paying what a hundred and something million dollar fine on hundreds of
[01:48:59.460 --> 01:49:05.180]  billions in profit from your deep research and living it for decades how
[01:49:05.180 --> 01:49:09.620]  does the drug trade really operate I mean now over in Afghanistan they have
[01:49:09.620 --> 01:49:14.820]  Fox News and ABC News going oh yes the Marines and Army help grow the opium and
[01:49:14.820 --> 01:49:18.660]  then we don't worry about where it goes after that but if we catch your kid with
[01:49:18.660 --> 01:49:22.540]  it we're going to put them in jail I mean isn't the drug war about having an
[01:49:22.540 --> 01:49:40.420]  illegal to keep the price up I was in a documentary that aired in Amsterdam and the Netherlands and it's called the drug wars damage done and I was
[01:49:40.420 --> 01:49:46.820]  thought to be on with a bunch of professional former military and drug
[01:49:46.820 --> 01:49:56.380]  enforcement officers that say it's a lost cause drugs should be legalized they
[01:49:56.380 --> 01:50:02.380]  should be controlled and you know not believing that because they legalize it
[01:50:02.380 --> 01:50:08.580]  everybody's going to go out and use drugs it's like alcohol you have
[01:50:08.580 --> 01:50:16.780]  alcoholics that you can't talk logically to them because they're they're
[01:50:16.780 --> 01:50:23.180]  addicted to alcohol it's the same with some that get addicted to narcotics these
[01:50:23.180 --> 01:50:29.460]  are health issues they're not criminal issues that's the way they should be
[01:50:29.460 --> 01:50:36.660]  handled they have AA for alcoholics does wonderful work they have NA
[01:50:36.660 --> 01:50:43.220]  and narcotics anonymous these are social issues but the problem is who there's
[01:50:43.220 --> 01:50:49.020]  too much money being made with the prison industry that they have more people in
[01:50:49.020 --> 01:50:55.700]  jail than any other nation in the world and I don't know what what American
[01:50:55.700 --> 01:51:00.660]  people are waiting for I guess that's why they want to take their guns away
[01:51:00.660 --> 01:51:07.640]  oh that was my next question I know you've according to your blog had some
[01:51:07.640 --> 01:51:11.460]  concerns about fast and furious obviously it's now been confirmed by the
[01:51:11.460 --> 01:51:15.940]  El Paso time Chicago Tribune in the federal documents that have come out
[01:51:15.940 --> 01:51:20.020]  that the Sinaloa drug cartel for at least five years has been working for
[01:51:20.020 --> 01:51:26.580]  the CIA FBI DEA and ATF to knock out the other cartels that are not laundering
[01:51:26.580 --> 01:51:30.180]  their money through the proper banks and that the whole thing in Mexico is
[01:51:30.180 --> 01:51:35.340]  about big banks using the US government and certain cartels to knock out their
[01:51:35.340 --> 01:51:43.100]  competition and consolidate that $500 billion a year industry and on the
[01:51:43.100 --> 01:51:48.580]  other issue then blame the Second Amendment for crime in Mexico and now
[01:51:48.580 --> 01:51:50.900]  even though the Attorney General has been caught perjuring himself to
[01:51:50.900 --> 01:51:54.780]  Congress he's been caught lying about ordering it he did indeed order it
[01:51:54.780 --> 01:51:59.100]  nobody's getting in trouble and then they're going ahead with trying to push
[01:51:59.100 --> 01:52:04.340]  more gun control in the name of stopping guns the US government allowed to be
[01:52:04.340 --> 01:52:08.740]  shipped in a sir pico what would you call that
[01:52:08.740 --> 01:52:16.900]  government suppression or government control or police you know the thing is
[01:52:16.900 --> 01:52:21.460]  you have guys that serve they know how to use the guns and then they come back
[01:52:21.460 --> 01:52:26.100]  and they take them away from them they're the very guys that should be you
[01:52:26.100 --> 01:52:30.100]  know able to keep their weapons to defend themselves and to defend the
[01:52:30.100 --> 01:52:35.460]  democracy that they fought for but unfortunately they say you can't fight
[01:52:35.460 --> 01:52:40.020]  city hall you know nothing changes the French they put this to charge the
[01:52:40.020 --> 01:52:44.740]  pico rest of the men the more things change the more they stay the same and
[01:52:44.740 --> 01:52:49.100]  then they want to say that all things are improving well things are not
[01:52:49.100 --> 01:52:55.340]  improving because in my day you know when the dealers were paying off I would
[01:52:55.340 --> 01:53:00.140]  catch a guy and he would say how come you're not walking up that guy I said
[01:53:00.140 --> 01:53:06.300]  which guy and he said you're locking me up because I'm not paying off and I
[01:53:06.300 --> 01:53:10.820]  said no I said I'll lock up anybody if you're violating the law I lock you up so
[01:53:10.820 --> 01:53:16.980]  he said would you lock up so-and-so well he referred to him as whitey I said try
[01:53:16.980 --> 01:53:24.060]  me and he gave me the information I locked him up and then I come in and I
[01:53:24.060 --> 01:53:33.700]  find out the guy you know killed a police officer and I come in and the
[01:53:33.700 --> 01:53:37.540]  other cops in the police and they're having coffee with the guy so you know
[01:53:37.540 --> 01:53:43.660]  they tell you there's this this allegiance and stuff let me just point
[01:53:43.660 --> 01:53:50.420]  in one way in my case they were talking about taking me out and one guy said
[01:53:50.420 --> 01:53:56.300]  we're talking about another cop and the response they got was we're talking
[01:53:56.300 --> 01:54:03.380]  about our money and the problem is the greed that these corporations have and
[01:54:03.380 --> 01:54:08.260]  then they control the masses by telling them that they have to live in a
[01:54:08.260 --> 01:54:13.180]  certain lifestyle otherwise they have no significance and it's very
[01:54:13.180 --> 01:54:18.500]  unfortunate that we don't have the right teachers that teach children their
[01:54:18.500 --> 01:54:26.180]  own value as a human being and they have just as much as anybody else with no
[01:54:26.180 --> 01:54:31.700]  matter how many titles he has or half of that soup after their name I have no
[01:54:31.700 --> 01:54:36.860]  respect for the man that empties my septic tank and the farmer that puts
[01:54:36.860 --> 01:54:42.860]  put food on my table then these politicians I have this saying that
[01:54:42.860 --> 01:54:50.820]  politics comes from the Greek route Pali meaning many and text which is a
[01:54:50.820 --> 01:54:56.060]  black fucking power so many ticks yes Frank Cerberco legendary New York
[01:54:56.060 --> 01:55:00.180]  detective who stood up and exposed corruption and was grievously wounded
[01:55:00.180 --> 01:55:06.420]  in the process but bottom line though here the big banks wander the money the
[01:55:06.420 --> 01:55:12.260]  Marines and Army grow the opium in every major city they either have a police
[01:55:12.260 --> 01:55:16.980]  chief that turns the blind eye or lives in a million dollar house I've grown up
[01:55:16.980 --> 01:55:21.780]  I've been you know in college to friends houses whose dads an FBI agent and it's
[01:55:21.780 --> 01:55:26.340]  a three million dollar house I grew up in Rockwall Texas and the police dealt
[01:55:26.340 --> 01:55:29.780]  drugs and it was well known and then they'd come give dare programs to the
[01:55:29.780 --> 01:55:33.660]  kids actually teaching them how to use it I mean you can Hollywood glamorizes
[01:55:33.660 --> 01:55:38.980]  it I mean it's a whole sales job and they keep the drugs illegal to keep the
[01:55:38.980 --> 01:55:44.340]  prices up and to pack our presents full of people to work for slave wages
[01:55:44.340 --> 01:55:48.500]  displacing everybody else's wages do you agree Frank Cerberco with that
[01:55:48.500 --> 01:55:56.740]  statement I find it hard to disagree I hear what you're saying and I believe
[01:55:56.740 --> 01:56:02.260]  that public service should be exactly that public service and you don't join
[01:56:02.260 --> 01:56:08.180]  the police or the FBI or the CIA to get rich it's supposed to be a public
[01:56:08.180 --> 01:56:14.580]  service that's the same for the politicians that they look like two
[01:56:14.580 --> 01:56:19.980]  cats fighting each other and instead of talking the good of the country they're
[01:56:19.980 --> 01:56:27.180]  talking about the good of that party and it gets us nowhere what percentage of
[01:56:27.180 --> 01:56:31.220]  the New York detectives when you work there I've seen numbers as high as 75
[01:56:31.220 --> 01:56:50.500]  percent what percentage were on the take the system is made to fail okay when I
[01:56:50.500 --> 01:56:57.740]  was a cop they had the expression about corruption the grass eaters and the meat
[01:56:57.740 --> 01:57:04.780]  eaters right so the grass eaters were referred to the guys that only took so
[01:57:04.780 --> 01:57:11.260]  called clean money see that was traffic money or gambling money or vice money
[01:57:11.260 --> 01:57:18.500]  and then and this is how I got into that agency because they told me it was the
[01:57:18.500 --> 01:57:24.580]  only way I could advance and everybody knew that agency was corrupt and they
[01:57:24.580 --> 01:57:30.060]  said to me there's a new department directive unless you do four years in
[01:57:30.060 --> 01:57:35.940]  plain clothes nobody goes into the detective division so here's what
[01:57:35.940 --> 01:57:44.020]  happened four years these offices get used to grazing okay it was like I'm
[01:57:44.020 --> 01:57:50.660]  talking about in the 60s there was in my unit you got $800 a month clean no
[01:57:50.660 --> 01:57:56.380]  questions no tax and plus anything you can make on the side any score that you
[01:57:56.380 --> 01:58:04.140]  can make then these guys are renting yachts and and custom-made suits burning
[01:58:04.140 --> 01:58:12.660]  their their illegal money you know extra apartments buying houses buying land
[01:58:12.660 --> 01:58:21.060]  all over the country and then they assigned them to narcotics now after grazing for
[01:58:21.060 --> 01:58:25.660]  four years you think all of a sudden they're gonna see the light and all of a
[01:58:25.660 --> 01:58:29.700]  sudden drugs Frank Serpico we're back in one minute do I do one more segment

[02:00:12.540 --> 02:00:20.060]  he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas
[02:00:20.060 --> 02:00:30.380]  Alex Jones by the way talking to Frank Serpico near that short little break of
[02:00:30.380 --> 02:00:38.380]  legendary New York detective website Frank Serpico.com I said so your your
[02:00:38.380 --> 02:00:42.380]  handsets broken you're on a speakerphone and he said yeah well there's really
[02:00:42.380 --> 02:00:46.620]  not much need to you know I have a you know a handheld because I don't really
[02:00:46.620 --> 02:00:49.660]  do any interviews and I said well how long is it been she's gonna interview and
[02:00:49.660 --> 02:00:54.780]  he said years so this is quite the interview I hear that it's been years
[02:00:54.780 --> 02:01:00.820]  since he's done a radio interview Frank Serpico Frank Alex let me say the last
[02:01:00.820 --> 02:01:07.820]  one I did was a calling show yes and this guy called in he said yeah hi I'm
[02:01:07.820 --> 02:01:12.460]  11 in Florida I'm a retired New York City police officer I said hey how you
[02:01:12.460 --> 02:01:17.940]  doing he says you know Frank today you testified before the NAP
[02:01:17.940 --> 02:01:23.780]  Commission was the darkest day of the history of the New York City police
[02:01:23.780 --> 02:01:30.060]  department I said really he said yeah I was ashamed to go home and face my
[02:01:30.060 --> 02:01:36.540]  wife and kids I said really I said why what did you do wrong he said nothing I
[02:01:36.540 --> 02:01:43.980]  said well why didn't you support me and he said what and be an outcast like you
[02:01:43.980 --> 02:01:49.100]  and that's what it's all about that's why they don't want whistleblowers because
[02:01:49.100 --> 02:01:52.860]  they don't want you to ruin a good business and once the corruption builds
[02:01:52.860 --> 02:01:57.900]  then no one will go after anybody even for worse and worse crimes and then the
[02:01:57.900 --> 02:02:03.020]  whole society collapses and Frank Serpico I believe we're nearing that third
[02:02:03.020 --> 02:02:09.300]  world collapse point what do you say I'm inclined to agree but again I want to
[02:02:09.300 --> 02:02:14.100]  say because I know a lot of decent police officers out there that are trying
[02:02:14.100 --> 02:02:19.020]  to do their job that meeting resistance and let me just tell you on a local
[02:02:19.020 --> 02:02:32.460]  incident there was my friend was being a costed and it was very serious
[02:02:32.460 --> 02:02:37.420]  circumstances and I called the police and they did a lousy follow-up and then
[02:02:37.420 --> 02:02:43.420]  there was a series of rape and I called the hotline that they said if you know
[02:02:43.420 --> 02:02:48.900]  anything call this number and I thought oh maybe if they follow up on this lead
[02:02:48.900 --> 02:02:56.140]  maybe they'll fight they never call me back on a hotline sir all the police do
[02:02:56.140 --> 02:02:59.500]  around here half the time is they're told I've talked to them they go write
[02:02:59.500 --> 02:03:03.780]  tickets and raise revenue and more and more you saw in Oakland last year he
[02:03:03.780 --> 02:03:08.980]  said 35 crimes we won't respond to including breaking and entering robbery
[02:03:08.980 --> 02:03:13.140]  I mean they're not they're there now more and more to literally just write
[02:03:13.140 --> 02:03:19.100]  tickets but that's what they're being told to do well they should rebel there
[02:03:19.100 --> 02:03:25.700]  that's a good that's a good thing but here's what happened you know and it's
[02:03:25.700 --> 02:03:30.940]  an old thing to you know in the department it's not black or white it's
[02:03:30.940 --> 02:03:39.460]  blue that's what happened in after Katrina did you remember the cat the
[02:03:39.460 --> 02:03:44.620]  catastrophe there with them shooting civilians and the cops running around
[02:03:44.620 --> 02:03:52.380]  Robin Walmart yeah and then same thing happened at 9-11 some of the firemen
[02:03:52.380 --> 02:04:00.660]  were filling their fire trucks with with clothes and and Rolexes like you say the
[02:04:00.660 --> 02:04:05.740]  society has to be revamped we have no more you know morality has been going
[02:04:05.740 --> 02:04:13.420]  down down hill anyway well here's the problem Frank government should be
[02:04:13.420 --> 02:04:18.380]  our leaders but they're not that part of the problem well Frank I mean the you're
[02:04:18.380 --> 02:04:22.180]  absolutely right but the big issue here is the government is running out of
[02:04:22.180 --> 02:04:25.860]  rackets and they want more more more so now they're taking people's kids if they
[02:04:25.860 --> 02:04:30.340]  spank them or the parents have dirty plates in the sink and then and then
[02:04:30.340 --> 02:04:33.940]  the states five times more likely to abuse the child than the parents Frank

[02:09:14.460 --> 02:09:17.900]  I know you're you're still very involved lecturing you said you haven't done
[02:09:17.900 --> 02:09:21.260]  radio in a very long time or done interviews but you are lecturing and
[02:09:21.260 --> 02:09:26.980]  you're also working out there to try to educate people about police corruption
[02:09:26.980 --> 02:09:30.860]  yeah well my bottom line is we're chasing
[02:09:30.860 --> 02:09:41.060]  phantoms around the world while ignoring the monsters in our own backyard and I think we have to get back to the family you know
[02:09:41.060 --> 02:09:47.060]  mothers have to realize what a great honor and responsibility it is to be a
[02:09:47.060 --> 02:09:53.500]  mother and and teach our children how to live hopefully we should stay away from
[02:09:53.500 --> 02:10:00.460]  all the junk food that these corporations are selling us and you know
[02:10:00.460 --> 02:10:06.700]  support the local economy that's how we that's what America was built on local
[02:10:06.700 --> 02:10:15.020]  economy not these outsourcing conglomerates you know they're closing
[02:10:15.020 --> 02:10:19.780]  down the little farm the food was good the meat was good the eggs were good
[02:10:19.780 --> 02:10:24.660]  they came out with all these government regulations but we got too much
[02:10:24.660 --> 02:10:30.900]  government control you know with just a simple example you have to wash the eggs when
[02:10:30.900 --> 02:10:35.820]  the I have my chickens and eggs and the eggs stay fresher when they're not washed
[02:10:35.820 --> 02:10:41.940]  because the chicken puts coats it with an antibacterial you wash it off and
[02:10:41.940 --> 02:10:46.740]  that's where you get the salmonella from because it's all these corporations and
[02:10:46.740 --> 02:10:51.460]  the way they're treating the meat and the system knows that now now Frank what
[02:10:51.460 --> 02:10:56.620]  should take on bin Laden supposedly being killed after all these years and
[02:10:56.620 --> 02:11:00.460]  they keep changing the official story and claim that they threw his body into
[02:11:00.460 --> 02:11:06.820]  the ocean well I think that's a good question we could ask the commander in
[02:11:06.820 --> 02:11:12.220]  chief you know and see what he has to say I think but the only problem is
[02:11:12.220 --> 02:11:20.060]  Alex they've been lying to us for so long they have zero credibility well
[02:11:20.060 --> 02:11:22.780]  that's right if you have a neighbor who you've caught lying to you five times you
[02:11:22.780 --> 02:11:26.540]  stop associating with them but government he lies even when the truth
[02:11:26.540 --> 02:11:30.220]  would serve them better I mean bottom line is it as a you know detective as a
[02:11:30.220 --> 02:11:35.060]  researcher as a lecturer when you look at things like 9-11 when you look at the
[02:11:35.060 --> 02:11:39.500]  lies about WMD's when you see the ridiculous bin Laden story and we have
[02:11:39.500 --> 02:11:44.100]  the intel he was dead 2002 that he would be rolled out later I mean bottom line
[02:11:44.100 --> 02:11:52.020]  what is Frank Serpico's view on the New World Order I think that you have to as
[02:11:52.020 --> 02:11:59.940]  they say believe half of everything you hear and see the intelligent part is
[02:11:59.940 --> 02:12:07.940]  which have to believe you know and but most importantly is to believe in
[02:12:07.940 --> 02:12:14.020]  yourself as an individual and clear your mind of all the pollution that they
[02:12:14.020 --> 02:12:22.420]  have feeding us 24 seven and you'll find that you knew it from the day you were
[02:12:22.420 --> 02:12:27.700]  born what the truth is absolutely our instincts our common sense is there and
[02:12:27.700 --> 02:12:31.900]  the modern brainwashing system is there to create confusion I was just reading
[02:12:31.900 --> 02:12:36.140]  your blog specifically though you you're you're saying something smells with a
[02:12:36.140 --> 02:12:41.500]  whole bin Laden caper yeah well I don't remember what I wrote on the blog back
[02:12:41.500 --> 02:12:46.460]  when but yeah of course it does you know the way they they went in there and
[02:12:46.460 --> 02:12:52.300]  yeah where is this guy you know you got the body that they why why can't we see
[02:12:52.300 --> 02:12:57.500]  the body well what they just figured it or something that somebody's gonna be
[02:12:57.500 --> 02:13:03.580]  embarrassed show us the body show us the corpus callicti you know but I mean
[02:13:03.580 --> 02:13:10.020]  your detective knows smells something of course what about passports not one but
[02:13:10.020 --> 02:13:13.860]  two magically surviving out of the planes at ground zero and then being
[02:13:13.860 --> 02:13:21.780]  found later that day by the FBI maybe they found a lucky charms elf as well
[02:13:21.780 --> 02:13:28.100]  you know in the business that's called a flake you know they drop it there you
[02:13:28.100 --> 02:13:36.780]  know like in New Orleans the cops talk about a ham sandwich you know dropping
[02:13:36.780 --> 02:13:45.700]  a gun on the suspect that wasn't there there I could tell you story after story
[02:13:45.700 --> 02:13:49.900]  about how people have been placed even with the narcotics you know they go
[02:13:49.900 --> 02:13:56.340]  after the user and they put on a felony a quantity and charge them as being a
[02:13:56.340 --> 02:14:02.220]  dealer and you ask them what they're doing and they say and only come anyway
[02:14:02.220 --> 02:14:15.180]  you just clean it off the street well now they've run out of drug dealers to
[02:14:15.180 --> 02:14:18.460]  lock up they're the drug dealers themselves while calling a drug user
[02:14:18.460 --> 02:14:22.660]  scum and then you see record numbers of police on drugs our troops are getting
[02:14:22.660 --> 02:14:28.620]  on drugs and it is so dangerous to have the police with all this power really
[02:14:28.620 --> 02:14:32.540]  being in more and more major cities a mafia I mean sir as you probably know
[02:14:32.540 --> 02:14:37.340]  it came out just two years ago in Dallas are now three that they just randomly
[02:14:37.340 --> 02:14:41.580]  pull over a nice car throw a bag of chalk in the back the drug lab certifies
[02:14:41.580 --> 02:14:46.860]  it as cocaine they're even taking old women's cars now with no criminal record
[02:14:46.860 --> 02:14:50.980]  I mean that is hardcore evil but you were saying back when you were in there
[02:14:50.980 --> 02:15:03.140]  they were shaking down drivers the French Connection yes all the drugs that
[02:15:03.140 --> 02:15:09.260]  was seized in the French Connection went back out on the street compliments of
[02:15:09.260 --> 02:15:15.660]  the NYPD all the drugs were taken out of the property clerk's office and
[02:15:15.660 --> 02:15:34.020]  replaced with flour incredible Frank Serpico I know that you as you said
[02:15:34.020 --> 02:15:37.740]  I've done a radio interview in a very long time and this has been incredible
[02:15:37.740 --> 02:15:42.100]  I'd like to get you in the next month or so back for a full hour to really just
[02:15:42.100 --> 02:15:48.820]  recount some of the incredible historic things that you have witnessed in your
[02:15:48.820 --> 02:15:52.460]  in your lifetime and obviously there's best-selling books written about you
[02:15:52.460 --> 02:15:58.180]  movies with with Al Pacino I want to bring Bob Chapman in because he's had a
[02:15:58.180 --> 02:16:05.380]  very interesting past as well formally in intelligence operations against the
[02:16:05.380 --> 02:16:09.060]  Soviets and then the largest children goldbroker for a while until he retired
[02:16:09.060 --> 02:16:12.660]  and then now he has one of the biggest newsletters out there on finances and I
[02:16:12.660 --> 02:16:16.380]  want to treat Bob since he's been holding as we held you over hey Bob I
[02:16:16.380 --> 02:16:19.700]  know it is a treat because I mean nobody hardly gets to talk to Frank Serpico
[02:16:19.700 --> 02:16:24.780]  Bob Chapman you got anything to say to Mr. Serpico well first I want to
[02:16:24.780 --> 02:16:29.660]  congratulate you as you have been many many times for what you've done for the
[02:16:29.660 --> 02:16:34.260]  people of the New York and this country more people would speak up like
[02:16:34.260 --> 02:16:40.380]  yourself we wouldn't have the problems we've got and corruption in in Lauren
[02:16:40.380 --> 02:16:45.460]  Forstman goes back for centuries you know that but the public doesn't realize
[02:16:45.460 --> 02:16:52.340]  that there's nothing new that's come down the line in a long time all you have
[02:16:52.340 --> 02:16:57.660]  to do is look at the history of crime and that's Wall Street as well as Harlem
[02:16:57.660 --> 02:17:02.260]  and and you know you know how to approach it and how to handle it and you
[02:17:02.260 --> 02:17:05.660]  did it and and everybody should be proud of you
[02:17:05.660 --> 02:17:16.700]  well thanks Bob and good luck to you and as he said you know the the quality of the
[02:17:16.700 --> 02:17:23.540]  good always the quantity of the evil that's out there so good people just
[02:17:23.540 --> 02:17:30.900]  have to stick together and and hopefully we can make a better world for our
[02:17:30.900 --> 02:17:36.300]  children well Frank do you agree with my point that if you just decriminalize not
[02:17:36.300 --> 02:17:40.380]  legalize but decriminalize and take the money out of drugs it won't be cool
[02:17:40.380 --> 02:17:44.100]  anymore the kids won't want to use it and the cops will lose their biggest
[02:17:44.100 --> 02:17:48.820]  source of corrupt income the banks will lose it I mean shouldn't we move to
[02:17:48.820 --> 02:17:52.740]  decriminalize drugs but then I get scared and think what will they come
[02:17:52.740 --> 02:17:56.540]  after next though well they're already trying vitamins minerals they're
[02:17:56.540 --> 02:18:00.100]  already rating whole milk places I mean they're already sending the drug
[02:18:00.100 --> 02:18:06.660]  squads out now against the Amish yep yep and they're wonderful people the Amish
[02:18:06.660 --> 02:18:14.260]  people I visited them happen and I said to one of the elders I said you know I
[02:18:14.260 --> 02:18:21.140]  really admire your way of life whose idea was it to live this way and he said
[02:18:21.140 --> 02:18:27.740]  what he says your grandfather was living this way and all of a sudden I
[02:18:27.740 --> 02:18:31.460]  realized because I remember when I visited my grandfather when I was a
[02:18:31.460 --> 02:18:41.300]  little kid in Europe it's just a simple life close to the earth and you know
[02:18:41.300 --> 02:18:48.260]  respecting the ground that's beating you and Frank now they're turning I don't
[02:18:48.260 --> 02:18:50.860]  know if you're aware of this you probably are they're now using the drug
[02:18:50.860 --> 02:18:58.100]  police against the Amish when they sell neighbor's cheese but I mean they're
[02:18:58.100 --> 02:19:01.860]  turning the corrupt narcotics police loose on the Amish I mean is there no
[02:19:01.860 --> 02:19:06.540]  end to this evil there's a great book out everything I want to do is illegal
[02:19:06.540 --> 02:19:11.860]  and he's not talking about drugs it's written by a farmer and how the
[02:19:11.860 --> 02:19:17.420]  conglomerates and all the government is taking over everything well Frank what
[02:19:17.420 --> 02:19:21.660]  in closing what do we do I mean if we did criminalize the drugs that would put
[02:19:21.660 --> 02:19:27.020]  on that would stop a lot of this yes but also we have to educate the other
[02:19:27.020 --> 02:19:32.900]  thing is why are so many people using drugs you know because you know when
[02:19:32.900 --> 02:19:38.340]  times get hard you know somebody you know you had a hard day or something you
[02:19:38.340 --> 02:19:47.700]  need a drink let me put it this way a good body of mine he's a Vietnam decorated
[02:19:47.700 --> 02:19:56.180]  wounded in action he's highly strong and he says to me you know Frank if these
[02:19:56.180 --> 02:20:01.420]  cops had any sense that knock on my door every morning hold on hold on there

[02:24:18.980 --> 02:24:23.740]  finishing up with Frank Serpico incredible interview with him and during
[02:24:23.740 --> 02:24:29.340]  the break he was bringing up the TSA he was bringing up a bunch of issues I
[02:24:29.340 --> 02:24:33.380]  want you to finish with that sir in a moment but I go ahead and get back to
[02:24:33.380 --> 02:24:38.540]  your veteran buddy who said hey the cops ought to knock on my door every morning

[02:25:11.700 --> 02:25:18.180]  that you know it's just terrible people think that some other people told me
[02:25:18.180 --> 02:25:24.700]  they came out of a party in New York and they opened the can of beer on the stoop
[02:25:24.700 --> 02:25:29.700]  and two plain clothes officers came across and arrested them oh no no they're
[02:25:29.700 --> 02:25:33.780]  now arresting women who sit on a park bench too long I mean and I've been in
[02:25:33.780 --> 02:25:36.900]  New York a lot over the years and the police are getting crazier and crazier
[02:25:36.900 --> 02:25:42.660]  they now act like complete thugs smoke cigars while they're arresting people
[02:25:42.660 --> 02:25:46.660]  their bellies are hanging out I mean it looks like worse than third-world
[02:25:46.660 --> 02:25:50.620]  countries I've been to Frank I mean how far is this going together they're
[02:25:50.620 --> 02:25:54.900]  gonna put gold thrones out for the police now and we'll have to lick their
[02:25:54.900 --> 02:26:11.420]  boots when we walk by Frank what's your final TSA point you were you raised
[02:26:11.420 --> 02:26:18.500]  that for me you said you don't fly I don't want to submit myself to what I
[02:26:18.500 --> 02:26:25.700]  call abuse it's amazing you know in the old days I could fly with my gun to any
[02:26:25.700 --> 02:26:29.660]  state in the union and I pray to the pilot you're supposed to turn your gun
[02:26:29.660 --> 02:26:33.700]  in and I say here he said what you want me to do with that he says I don't know
[02:26:33.700 --> 02:26:39.420]  how to use it you keep it you try a police officer now or you know the
[02:26:39.420 --> 02:26:44.420]  respectable people try to get on with a nail file and they're telling us that
[02:26:44.420 --> 02:26:50.940]  we're freer and safer now you know but you know the American people they're
[02:26:50.940 --> 02:26:56.420]  not stupid they're catching on to the rhetoric and you know the different
[02:26:56.420 --> 02:27:01.660]  terms they're using you know if you object to anything you're you're a
[02:27:01.660 --> 02:27:10.540]  terrorist or whatever but I think the time is running out absolutely people
[02:27:10.540 --> 02:27:15.060]  are waking up they're using the war on terror to to to basically set up a
[02:27:15.060 --> 02:27:19.780]  domestic third-world police state or East German Stasi is that what you're
[02:27:19.780 --> 02:27:36.420]  getting at Frank's you know we have a look at what happened in England now they want to take the phones away from they want to take away their civil liberties just because maybe one yahoo or something
[02:27:36.420 --> 02:27:45.820]  violated or used it for a bad purpose it doesn't mean everybody's bad you know well
[02:27:45.820 --> 02:27:53.220]  San Francisco just turn absolutely San Francisco just turned the cell phones off
[02:27:53.220 --> 02:27:56.660]  last week because of a peaceful demonstration cut everybody's cell
[02:27:56.660 --> 02:28:00.740]  phones off absolutely well said well Frank Serpico I could certainly see why
[02:28:00.740 --> 02:28:05.580]  you stood up back in the 70s and you're standing up now I wish you weren't
[02:28:05.580 --> 02:28:09.260]  one in a million but God bless you and I look forward to speaking to you again
[02:28:09.260 --> 02:28:15.140]  here on the radio thank you all right there he goes Frank Serpico and I
[02:28:15.140 --> 02:28:18.620]  apologize to Bob Chapman a lot of times we have some incredible guests on and
[02:28:18.620 --> 02:28:22.900]  then go into Bob's time but I know he understands that we just hold Bob Chapman
[02:28:22.900 --> 02:28:26.700]  over but I know it's not a tough job to get to listen to Frank Serpico what did
[02:28:26.700 --> 02:28:30.780]  you think about that interview Bob Chapman I thought it was absolutely
[02:28:30.780 --> 02:28:37.420]  fantastic it was like a breath of fresh air because he hasn't been exposed to the
[02:28:37.420 --> 02:28:44.140]  public for so many years in this medium and to be able to reiterate not only
[02:28:44.140 --> 02:28:49.340]  some of the things that happened 30 years ago but apply it to today and
[02:28:49.340 --> 02:28:53.820]  that's what's important for us to understand what direction things are
[02:28:53.820 --> 02:28:59.500]  going in and try to perceive what people have to do socially politically
[02:28:59.500 --> 02:29:04.620]  investment-wise to keep everything together for themselves the only thing I
[02:29:04.620 --> 02:29:12.780]  missed was how old is he he's 75 isn't he guys 75 years old you know that's I
[02:29:12.780 --> 02:29:16.980]  should have asked the question I should have said what's your date of birth
[02:29:16.980 --> 02:29:23.460]  because I'll be 76 in two months now your same age as Frank Serpico you

[02:32:02.860 --> 02:32:07.180]  consider buying a solar power generator number one new climate legislation
[02:32:07.180 --> 02:32:10.540]  could easily double or triple your electric bill number two our new
[02:32:10.540 --> 02:32:14.460]  energies are wants to control how much power your electric company allows you
[02:32:14.460 --> 02:32:18.660]  to have it's true total government control of electricity in the name of
[02:32:18.660 --> 02:32:23.100]  smart grid technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the
[02:32:23.100 --> 02:32:27.860]  power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only
[02:32:27.860 --> 02:32:31.660]  compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to
[02:32:31.660 --> 02:32:35.300]  local grids every year thousands of families lose their power from weather
[02:32:35.300 --> 02:32:39.620]  related onages number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup
[02:32:39.620 --> 02:32:42.780]  insurance and peace of mind folks I really believe in the solar power

[02:33:14.980 --> 02:33:19.140]  the GCN radio network
[02:33:22.140 --> 02:33:26.500]  Bob Chapman is our guest we're gonna do a little bit of hover drive next hour

[02:33:31.860 --> 02:33:38.820]  a gold French or European Frank already an insanely low price Ted mentioned the
[02:33:38.820 --> 02:33:42.820]  price earlier it's insane you get a free year subscription to a coveted
[02:33:42.820 --> 02:33:46.660]  newsletter that comes out twice a week digitally couple times a month in the
[02:33:46.660 --> 02:33:52.420]  hard copy it's usually over 50 pages long it's read by State Department CIA Bob
[02:33:52.420 --> 02:33:57.620]  really knows his stuff he's not a somebody who puts out baloney you can
[02:33:57.620 --> 02:34:03.940]  call Midas 800 686 2237 also Ted bought his gold and silver when silver was at
[02:34:03.940 --> 02:34:10.900]  about 39 gold at about 1775 I said can't we just say 1776 the last big group he
[02:34:10.900 --> 02:34:17.740]  was able to obtain so the deals they've got right now reflect pricing from where
[02:34:17.740 --> 02:34:23.260]  it was a few weeks ago that will sell out and so when it's you know 1900 he'll
[02:34:23.260 --> 02:34:27.860]  have stuff he bought it 1850 he's making those purchases right now he's got it on
[02:34:27.860 --> 02:34:32.340]  hand ready to ship to you a whole list of radio specials silver dollars that
[02:34:32.340 --> 02:34:35.420]  cost you name it how are they at cost because he bought it when it was lower
[02:34:35.420 --> 02:34:39.140]  that's how Ted makes his profit it's okay to make a profit he's financing
[02:34:39.140 --> 02:34:47.500]  liberty and freedom 800 686 2237 800 686 237 now I'm gonna go ahead and do this

[02:35:14.660 --> 02:35:18.380]  about this a month ago I chose to not interview him not because I think he's
[02:35:18.380 --> 02:35:24.780]  lying but because I just was waiting to see what came out with it because we
[02:35:24.780 --> 02:35:30.100]  either totally break something with absolute proof or we analyze other
[02:35:30.100 --> 02:35:34.780]  people's news okay I mean if I get up here and say Dinecore is running child
[02:35:34.780 --> 02:35:39.620]  kidnapping rings I've got the Chicago Tribune Houston Chronicle and truth is
[02:35:39.620 --> 02:35:43.860]  stranger than fiction I mean it's in a major Israeli papers that the government
[02:35:43.860 --> 02:35:48.460]  was reportedly putting steroids in in shampoos well I've got a whole stack of
[02:35:48.460 --> 02:35:53.900]  news where our government does that I mean it won't be the first politician
[02:35:53.900 --> 02:36:00.180]  running around crazy chasing women the personality of an ego to sell out who
[02:36:00.180 --> 02:36:03.900]  doesn't have self-control if you sell people out if you'll say girls have got
[02:36:03.900 --> 02:36:08.100]  to take a force inoculation that they know is killing people and then lie and
[02:36:08.100 --> 02:36:12.380]  say I'm the governor you have to take it knowing that was a lie then he could do
[02:36:12.380 --> 02:36:17.580]  anything but we'll we're gonna get into next hour have you ever had sex with

[02:36:52.660 --> 02:36:57.140]  but that isn't proof you can say you've always heard that Alex Jones is from the
[02:36:57.140 --> 02:37:00.380]  planet Pop-Tar so I don't know if it's true but I was just talking to him
[02:37:00.380 --> 02:37:05.500]  during the break and and he told me stuff and I said buddy if this is true you
[02:37:05.500 --> 02:37:08.380]  better get these witnesses to come out right now or you're deader than door
[02:37:08.380 --> 02:37:12.740]  nail now I want to be clear I don't have any firsthand stuff and we're gonna get
[02:37:12.740 --> 02:37:16.900]  this all out in the open factor I wasn't gonna do this interview but because I
[02:37:16.900 --> 02:37:21.220]  know that Perry snooping around and telling national host he's scared of me
[02:37:21.220 --> 02:37:27.900]  right now that I just like I told the DC madam you better get all what you know

[02:37:37.340 --> 02:37:44.580]  I mean this is not a game this is not a game this is super dangerous okay and so
[02:37:44.580 --> 02:37:48.980]  we're just gonna try to get the full injection of poison out next hour and I
[02:37:48.980 --> 02:37:53.620]  warned tomorrow I said listen if what you're saying is true you're deader than

[02:38:22.700 --> 02:38:29.700]  the reports we're getting here right now about Rick Perry absolutely true because
[02:38:29.700 --> 02:38:34.260]  I heard you know I had people telling me I have no proof of what you're talking
[02:38:34.260 --> 02:38:41.820]  about and I was on other programs where they brought it up and they say that they
[02:38:41.820 --> 02:38:48.860]  had talked to people who said that that was so so you're saying you've talked to
[02:38:48.860 --> 02:38:54.060]  a lot of high-level sources and they've gotten the same intel on Perry I talked
[02:38:54.060 --> 02:39:01.860]  to one but I know of others who have talked to one or two one of whom was
[02:39:01.860 --> 02:39:13.660]  within the staff structure of the gentleman and he said yeah he's one of
[02:39:13.660 --> 02:39:22.260]  us oh boy well you know what Clinton did to people he would send a special unit
[02:39:22.260 --> 02:39:26.740]  of state police to kill you or beat you to death that even came out in court the
[02:39:26.740 --> 02:39:29.900]  guy that was videotaping and visiting Jennifer Flowers you know across the
[02:39:29.900 --> 02:39:34.500]  apartment I mean they they broke his trachea broke his arms as legs I mean
[02:39:34.500 --> 02:39:38.580]  this is this is super dangerous stuff I'd rather go after Perry for the forced
[02:39:38.580 --> 02:39:44.460]  inoculations nap the superhighways being Al Gore's former minion I mean I've
[02:39:44.460 --> 02:39:48.340]  got to be honest with you I'm not afraid of being killed but I don't want to be
[02:39:48.340 --> 02:39:52.220]  killed just because I was exposing their minion their puppet their piece of
[02:39:52.220 --> 02:39:57.180]  trash Rick Perry I want to live to fight another day and to know from a major
[02:39:57.180 --> 02:40:01.660]  Fox host that Rick Perry told him last year I am scared to death of Ron Paul
[02:40:01.660 --> 02:40:05.980]  and Alex Jones why do you think Rick Perry is so scared of Ron Paul and Alex
[02:40:05.980 --> 02:40:12.140]  Jones he's afraid of the truth and the truth will destroy him and he's been his
[02:40:12.140 --> 02:40:18.300]  mission the way I see it is to neutralize Ron Paul and essentially take
[02:40:18.300 --> 02:40:22.740]  him out of contention that's what this is all about I don't think that they
[02:40:22.740 --> 02:40:25.980]  really want him for president because he's gonna serve another need and of
[02:40:25.980 --> 02:40:32.940]  course he'll get paid off handsomely from that and who they want for president I
[02:40:32.940 --> 02:40:37.580]  don't know maybe they don't know at this point they might have a number of
[02:40:37.580 --> 02:40:41.820]  people lined up and it may not be the people that we're talking about Perry
[02:40:41.820 --> 02:40:49.620]  or our Bachman or you know for the Republican Party or Romney we just
[02:40:49.620 --> 02:40:53.340]  don't know absolutely I want to get into the economy and then get back into the
[02:40:53.340 --> 02:40:59.700]  election and Ron Paul with you the gentleman Robert Morrow is is joining
[02:40:59.700 --> 02:41:05.220]  us he's a libertarian he is an admitted frequenter of the topless bars I
[02:41:05.220 --> 02:41:08.700]  actually have a lot of friends and long-term acquaintances that are in
[02:41:08.700 --> 02:41:11.980]  politics and government in other areas here in Austin and they've known him
[02:41:11.980 --> 02:41:16.820]  for years they they seem to think he's not some curl-rove infiltrator to put a
[02:41:16.820 --> 02:41:20.940]  false story out about Perry to then be blamed on Paul but it could be used that
[02:41:20.940 --> 02:41:25.180]  way regardless and only because this is a big national news story am I even
[02:41:25.180 --> 02:41:31.020]  covering this so we've got mr. Morrow joining us at eight after let before we
[02:41:31.020 --> 02:41:35.500]  segue back into the economy and then back into Ron Paul Richard Reeves talk
[02:41:35.500 --> 02:41:39.700]  show host good friend of mine I worked with us often off the last six six
[02:41:39.700 --> 02:41:43.540]  seven years only for a decade or more what's your smell test on this whole
[02:41:43.540 --> 02:41:47.540]  whole Rick Perry thing well that's a good question Alex I've been weighing that
[02:41:47.540 --> 02:41:52.500]  myself right now the a lot of the mainstream press is definitely loving
[02:41:52.500 --> 02:41:58.180]  on Rick Perry and pushing him for example just last Friday I was pulling up
[02:41:58.180 --> 02:42:01.380]  the Google Android phone and hit the news button on the Google search engine
[02:42:01.380 --> 02:42:06.420]  and the top headline contain the words governor Perry Texas miracle and that's
[02:42:06.420 --> 02:42:12.420]  the kind of headline love that Barack Obama was getting back in the 2008
[02:42:12.420 --> 02:42:17.740]  election campaign so it's not clear exactly what they're going to do they're
[02:42:17.740 --> 02:42:21.860]  calling him Ronald Reagan to in the slick black hair exactly they're loving on in
[02:42:21.860 --> 02:42:25.780]  big time doesn't Liberace you want to run his fingers through it exactly and
[02:42:25.780 --> 02:42:29.620]  that's like with the bifurcated media the way they've set it up now where you've
[02:42:29.620 --> 02:42:34.220]  got the MSNBC the left side and whoever the left attacks becomes the front
[02:42:34.220 --> 02:42:37.900]  runner exactly whoever the right attacks becomes the front runner exactly so
[02:42:37.900 --> 02:42:42.420]  they're utilizing all that bifurcated media now to a T so the the new world
[02:42:42.420 --> 02:42:47.100]  order are definitely political masters and here we are we're the political
[02:42:47.100 --> 02:42:51.900]  neophytes we're like a we're like a local junior college team at a political
[02:42:51.900 --> 02:42:56.620]  level right now but we keep moving up we keep moving up our game and I think you
[02:42:56.620 --> 02:42:59.700]  know this upcoming year hopefully we can be up there and we're gonna talk about
[02:42:59.700 --> 02:43:02.700]  some strategies to get Ron Paul in because you've worked down at the
[02:43:02.700 --> 02:43:07.980]  delegate level and that is one of the key areas Bob Chapman you're getting
[02:43:07.980 --> 02:43:12.300]  back into the economy I mean it's old news for our audience everything we've
[02:43:12.300 --> 02:43:16.860]  said is now happening because we know it's a pre-planned globalist program you
[02:43:16.860 --> 02:43:20.140]  said they would be implode start imploding the euro but out of that
[02:43:20.140 --> 02:43:24.260]  announced their Bank of the World they're now doing that admitting it's an
[02:43:24.260 --> 02:43:28.700]  economic dictatorship even mainstream news is saying that what's coming next
[02:43:28.700 --> 02:43:33.660]  for gold and silver what's coming next with the globalist when you heard the
[02:43:33.660 --> 02:43:38.900]  song up up and away and and that's just the way it's going to be and you know
[02:43:38.900 --> 02:43:45.740]  one of the psychological aspects of this and these people are very good at
[02:43:45.740 --> 02:43:52.380]  this but if you know what they're doing you can spot it right away and JP Morgan
[02:43:52.380 --> 02:43:57.380]  Chase come out a couple of days ago and said gold's going to $2,500 by the end
[02:43:57.380 --> 02:44:03.740]  of the year and here they are with the largest short position they could short
[02:44:03.740 --> 02:44:10.140]  position in silver and silver usually runs with gold and so you've kind of
[02:44:10.140 --> 02:44:15.540]  figured what are they up to what they're up to is this they're trying to set up a
[02:44:15.540 --> 02:44:23.980]  barrier the barrier is $2,500 because they think on the short term before the
[02:44:23.980 --> 02:44:28.020]  end of the year it could go higher than the way you did it again you said that
[02:44:28.020 --> 02:44:33.020]  last Friday and then yesterday I was watching MSNBC at 3 in the morning I
[02:44:33.020 --> 02:44:38.220]  couldn't sleep and there they were admitting saying well JP Morgan had to
[02:44:38.220 --> 02:44:43.820]  admit this because they're trying to set a psychological new ceiling I mean Bob
[02:44:43.820 --> 02:44:50.380]  you just are awesome well thank you very much it it's just common sense and
[02:44:50.380 --> 02:44:55.340]  understanding the criminal mind and if you want to find out what they're doing
[02:44:55.340 --> 02:44:59.340]  you have to think like a criminal and obviously I have that talent I should
[02:44:59.340 --> 02:45:03.860]  have been a policeman like Frank Cipriko but anyway I probably would have ended up
[02:45:03.860 --> 02:45:07.860]  with like him you know out of the business because I couldn't tolerate
[02:45:07.860 --> 02:45:13.220]  the bad things that were going on within the police structure well once you let
[02:45:13.220 --> 02:45:18.780]  any corruption in that that's what they're trying to do here and they're
[02:45:18.780 --> 02:45:23.700]  not frightened about gold they know what's going $8,000 they're just as
[02:45:23.700 --> 02:45:30.380]  smart as we are but they wanted to go there as slowly and incrementally as
[02:45:30.380 --> 02:45:36.500]  possible and you said three years ago when people are about $2,500 gold for
[02:45:36.500 --> 02:45:40.220]  inflation in 1980 you said no it'll take about three years when people were
[02:45:40.220 --> 02:45:43.580]  saying would take a year and now here we are three years later and they say
[02:45:43.580 --> 02:45:51.300]  $2,500 by Christmas and you were saying what last week that that could be as
[02:45:51.300 --> 02:45:57.820]  high as $3,000 by next Christmas no by the end of February that's usually the
[02:45:57.820 --> 02:46:02.380]  end of the quote season for gold so you're saying you're saying six months from
[02:46:02.380 --> 02:46:06.340]  now Iran would say that again please you're saying six months from now it
[02:46:06.340 --> 02:46:11.060]  could be three thousand yeah three thousand thirty two hundred and
[02:46:11.060 --> 02:46:14.980]  incidentally being on two weeks ago with Paul Craig Roberts was a thrill he's
[02:46:14.980 --> 02:46:20.580]  one of my heroes and anytime I can get on with them let me know well I mean I
[02:46:20.580 --> 02:46:29.860]  got you're almost serpico yes thank you well you know what's funny I do quite a
[02:46:29.860 --> 02:46:34.140]  few radio interviews during three and four minute breaks sometimes and one day
[02:46:34.140 --> 02:46:38.340]  I had Jesse Ventura on me as a guest and then I went on the station for my
[02:46:38.340 --> 02:46:41.580]  four-minute interview during the long break at 20 after and I don't think
[02:46:41.580 --> 02:46:50.220]  they believed I really had Jesse Ventura it was funny but but beside issue Bob in
[02:46:50.220 --> 02:46:55.940]  my gut though I feel like this Rick Perry sex stuff is really dangerous well you
[02:46:55.940 --> 02:47:02.260]  know facts to facts and if we talk about it in that possibility and we can get
[02:47:02.260 --> 02:47:08.220]  proof then the major media is gonna have to handle it and the man that's been
[02:47:08.220 --> 02:47:15.300]  sent in to neutralize Ron Paul will be out of business and that's good boy you
[02:47:15.300 --> 02:47:21.020]  play hardball there Chapman well you know when you 76 you don't give up what
[02:47:21.020 --> 02:47:27.420]  you're gonna call it oh boy wait till Larry Frank Cerberco he'll tell you wait
[02:47:27.420 --> 02:47:32.300]  till Larry down blow him out wait till Larry Flint gets all of this Rick Perry
[02:47:32.300 --> 02:47:35.300]  stuff you're gonna say something mom well hopefully the press gets a hold of
[02:47:35.300 --> 02:47:39.020]  the story here what happened the Texas Legislative session when Rick Perry and
[02:47:39.020 --> 02:47:44.100]  Dewhurst crushed the anti-TSA groping bill that's that's something we can't
[02:47:44.100 --> 02:47:48.340]  let the news forget about either yeah Richard tell folks about that well you
[02:47:48.340 --> 02:47:51.240]  talked about it a lot you made the major push here at the Texas Legislative
[02:47:51.240 --> 02:47:55.780]  Legislative session with the David Simpson bill that was the TSA anti groping
[02:47:55.780 --> 02:47:59.420]  bill and I tell you what if Rick Perry has a second printing of his book it
[02:47:59.420 --> 02:48:04.140]  shouldn't be fed up it should be laid down because that's exactly what Rick
[02:48:04.140 --> 02:48:09.540]  Perry and his cronies did in our state legislature they laid down remember
[02:48:09.540 --> 02:48:13.340]  that's reportedly all Perry cares about his land down well it wouldn't surprise
[02:48:13.340 --> 02:48:16.900]  me at that fact either but we'll let Robert Morrow handle that end of it but
[02:48:16.900 --> 02:48:21.460]  another thing that needs to be brought out is if you want tolls on existing
[02:48:21.460 --> 02:48:27.260]  roads Rick Perry signed legislation I think back in the early 2001 2002 3
[02:48:27.260 --> 02:48:31.340]  somewhere around there where they're taking existing roads existing US
[02:48:31.340 --> 02:48:36.300]  highway which is illegal well I'll tell you what we sure don't like it but he
[02:48:36.300 --> 02:48:40.380]  signed an executive order saying they could violate federal law but in that
[02:48:40.380 --> 02:48:43.420]  executive order show what Obama signs an executive order saying all the
[02:48:43.420 --> 02:48:47.100]  illegals are legal doesn't make it so exactly that's like the supposedly
[02:48:47.100 --> 02:48:51.420]  slavery was legal as well so there's you know another example but yeah
[02:48:51.420 --> 02:48:54.820]  toll roads are good I mean what's what are we gonna tell every road in the
[02:48:54.820 --> 02:48:57.900]  country are you gonna have to pay a toll just to pull out of your driveway so
[02:48:57.900 --> 02:49:01.620]  let's not forget that about Rick Perry either so there's a lot of things we saw
[02:49:01.620 --> 02:49:06.060]  the animal RFID start to come to fruition during Rick Perry's term here's
[02:49:06.060 --> 02:49:11.580]  governor we saw premises ID come to fruition it was the only state the feds
[02:49:11.580 --> 02:49:15.540]  could get a governor that ran through premises ID and my family's got a farm
[02:49:15.540 --> 02:49:19.180]  they read that document it basically hands your land over and waves your
[02:49:19.180 --> 02:49:25.420]  fourth amendment to the feds and their dirty designates exactly well Bob
[02:49:25.420 --> 02:49:28.540]  mentioned it a little while ago talking about Ron Paul and that's one of the
[02:49:28.540 --> 02:49:32.700]  reasons I came in today was to discuss a little bit about Ron Paul and yeah tell
[02:49:32.700 --> 02:49:37.820]  us the secret weapon well one of the secret weapons is of course the website
[02:49:37.820 --> 02:49:42.180]  Ron Paul 2012 it happens to be by Providence you've invited me here today
[02:49:42.180 --> 02:49:47.140]  because guess what at midnight they're starting the Ron Paul birthday money
[02:49:47.140 --> 02:49:52.060]  bomb tonight at midnight tonight is Friday August 19th midnight for the
[02:49:52.060 --> 02:49:56.620]  next 24 hours starting at midnight it's the Ron Paul money bomb and they're
[02:49:56.620 --> 02:50:02.500]  suggesting to give a donation of $20 and 12 cents $20 and 12 cents or his
[02:50:02.500 --> 02:50:07.780]  birthday age is going to be 76 years old so that's another good number to to hit
[02:50:07.780 --> 02:50:11.860]  him up with but the precinct conventions let me go into the precinct
[02:50:11.860 --> 02:50:17.420]  conventions and how important these are going to be folks please stop multitasking
[02:50:17.420 --> 02:50:22.500]  just for a little bit right now please stop multitasking write down precinct
[02:50:22.500 --> 02:50:26.340]  conventions and leading up to precinct conventions what we need to do is
[02:50:26.340 --> 02:50:31.340]  everybody in the next few days get your yard signs out your bumper stickers out
[02:50:31.340 --> 02:50:36.420]  and then drive by folks don't know it's not the popular vote even if Paul wins
[02:50:36.420 --> 02:50:40.180]  states and we've had this happen before they will send in their operatives to
[02:50:40.180 --> 02:50:43.660]  just ignore that at the state level what we need to do or create many straw
[02:50:43.660 --> 02:50:48.300]  polls in these precinct conventions and that way at the RNC we can nominate Ron
[02:50:48.300 --> 02:50:53.260]  Paul as the nominee for the Republican Party but you know Richard that isn't
[02:50:53.260 --> 02:50:56.040]  really what matters that one in Guardian came out and said if we don't pay
[02:50:56.040 --> 02:51:01.140]  Al Gore carbon tax money aliens will attack I'm not kidding

[02:54:31.420 --> 02:54:34.940]  Robert I don't know it was a month ago or more called us with it and I knew the
[02:54:34.940 --> 02:54:42.700]  name I think I've met him but I was like ah and and and then now I saw the
[02:54:42.700 --> 02:54:47.580]  reports earlier this week and now it's a big national news story so one way or
[02:54:47.580 --> 02:54:51.660]  the other he believes it and he says he's got the sources so people are gonna get
[02:54:51.660 --> 02:54:55.820]  the skinny coming up here at 8 after now Bob Chapman's our guest right now for
[02:54:55.820 --> 02:54:59.180]  this segment the next you're going to continue with us Reeves since you know
[02:54:59.180 --> 02:55:04.220]  Morrow you're already in here on other issues but this precinct
[02:55:04.220 --> 02:55:09.420]  issue you're calling it a mini straw pole and this is where they send in the
[02:55:09.420 --> 02:55:13.180]  political operatives to try to shut things down to describe how important
[02:55:13.180 --> 02:55:18.300]  this is tell people the chicanery that happened in the 2008 election
[02:55:18.300 --> 02:55:22.700]  well you had a variety of chicanery you had Louisiana had some chicanery there
[02:55:22.700 --> 02:55:27.740]  where a lot of Ron Paul delegates were they tried to deny them access to their
[02:55:27.740 --> 02:55:31.820]  conventions and also in Nevada and here in Texas we had Wharton County
[02:55:31.820 --> 02:55:36.940]  where those Ron Paul delegates were pushed out pretty much illegally as a
[02:55:36.940 --> 02:55:39.740]  matter of fact there was a lawsuit filed on that I don't know the outcome of it
[02:55:39.740 --> 02:55:46.060]  is but the thing of it is is if we just go out to our precincts and do the
[02:55:46.060 --> 02:55:49.820]  drive-by canvassing first where you go see the yard signs and the bumper
[02:55:49.820 --> 02:55:54.300]  stickers and knock on those people's doors and hook up with them and get them
[02:55:54.300 --> 02:55:58.780]  revved up and ready to go out and work the rest of your precinct get voter
[02:55:58.780 --> 02:56:02.780]  primary republican primary voter lists how about this for ground troop info
[02:56:02.780 --> 02:56:07.260]  warriors alex get those republican primary voter lists and go hand out
[02:56:07.260 --> 02:56:12.060]  follow the republic obama deception to these people what we need is an info
[02:56:12.060 --> 02:56:16.380]  warrior ground force to hit the ground right now between now
[02:56:16.380 --> 02:56:19.900]  and your statewide and by the way you're not going to see the new order blow up
[02:56:19.900 --> 02:56:24.300]  the first dvd you hand out it just takes time look at how Perry's having to come
[02:56:24.300 --> 02:56:27.420]  out and say the Federal Reserve is treacherous and treasonous
[02:56:27.420 --> 02:56:31.900]  look at how they're trying to mimic us now that's how desperate they've gotten
[02:56:31.900 --> 02:56:35.420]  that they can't beat us they're trying to join us just so they can betray us
[02:56:35.420 --> 02:56:39.500]  well let me weigh in on Rick Perry's statement because he put a big fat
[02:56:39.500 --> 02:56:43.500]  qualifier on that money before the election god don't print money before
[02:56:43.500 --> 02:56:47.100]  the election you'll be playing politics well i tell you what that was
[02:56:47.100 --> 02:56:51.580]  Rick Perry he throws people like us a bone saying oh wow he's actually fighting
[02:56:51.580 --> 02:56:55.820]  the Federal Reserve uh-uh no he said nothing about deleting the Federal
[02:56:55.820 --> 02:56:58.380]  Reserve getting rid of the Federal Reserve making changes
[02:56:58.380 --> 02:57:01.660]  to our money system at all nothing about auditing and he just said don't print
[02:57:01.660 --> 02:57:05.260]  more money before the election money because what he wants now and to prove
[02:57:05.260 --> 02:57:08.300]  he's a hundred percent political is it looks like they're throwing obama under
[02:57:08.300 --> 02:57:13.420]  the bus potentially with this economy uh well remember the bush clip
[02:57:13.420 --> 02:57:16.060]  and i want to get bob chatman's take on this when he said right before he left
[02:57:16.060 --> 02:57:21.100]  he goes i like obama he's not going to go oh poor me poor me we got to pull that
[02:57:21.100 --> 02:57:24.540]  clip up oh i inherited this bad economy no obama's not
[02:57:24.540 --> 02:57:27.020]  going to do that they've had this whole thing scripted
[02:57:27.020 --> 02:57:30.940]  it's pretty much with obama right now the dog ate my recovery
[02:57:30.940 --> 02:57:34.860]  right now is how he's going to dog ate my homework the dog ate my recovery
[02:57:34.860 --> 02:57:40.620]  uh bob chatman what's your take on that oh i think that's correct and
[02:57:40.620 --> 02:57:44.860]  you'll have all kind of kinds of excuses but if you go back to the basic
[02:57:44.860 --> 02:57:49.260]  premise square one uh and think about why they're doing what they're doing
[02:57:49.260 --> 02:57:52.940]  collectively from behind the scenes in both parties
[02:57:52.940 --> 02:57:56.940]  it's to bring the american european and british economies down
[02:57:56.940 --> 02:58:01.660]  to a level where people are going to have to if they want to eat and survive
[02:58:01.660 --> 02:58:06.060]  except world government and really this is what they're all pointing towards
[02:58:06.060 --> 02:58:09.580]  that's right except ron paul of course exactly these idiots say though they
[02:58:09.580 --> 02:58:12.540]  don't want to hurt their economy they're making money the globalist issue the
[02:58:12.540 --> 02:58:18.540]  money it's all about consolidating destroying economies to control them

[03:00:36.940 --> 03:00:41.500]  years and he's either right about what he's saying
[03:00:41.500 --> 03:00:46.300]  or he's crazy a lot of folks say that they don't think he's an operative if he
[03:00:46.300 --> 03:00:48.780]  is a carl rove guy he's a deep cover operative
[03:00:48.780 --> 03:00:52.220]  he's going to be joining us you know he contacted me a month ago and
[03:00:52.220 --> 03:00:55.500]  i heard the accusations and the name rung a bell and i brought it up to people
[03:00:55.500 --> 03:00:59.500]  on doing they said no we know him and he is a frequenter of
[03:00:59.500 --> 03:01:05.420]  of these establishments and uh robert morrow right now yeah
[03:01:05.420 --> 03:01:09.740]  i've known robert four or five years six years i'm not sure exactly how long
[03:01:09.740 --> 03:01:13.260]  but this guy is not an operative for carl rove
[03:01:13.260 --> 03:01:19.900]  he and i did footwork on foot in his neighborhood knocking on doors i've been
[03:01:19.900 --> 03:01:24.300]  told he's a super hard charger he is he is super hard charge he does a ton of
[03:01:24.300 --> 03:01:29.820]  research and so no i'm not i'm saying i it's just this is
[03:01:29.820 --> 03:01:32.620]  super dangerous exactly i and he's telling me that he
[03:01:32.620 --> 03:01:35.900]  actually knows the women's names he's just putting this out now to get others
[03:01:35.900 --> 03:01:38.460]  to come forward because the ones he knows won't come forward and they're
[03:01:38.460 --> 03:01:41.900]  scared and they should be scared they better just go public right now
[03:01:41.900 --> 03:01:44.700]  listen this could have stayed in the closet earlier
[03:01:44.700 --> 03:01:49.020]  okay and and and focused on other issues but now that it's out it's got to all
[03:01:49.020 --> 03:01:51.580]  come out well i'm gonna warn everybody and now
[03:01:51.580 --> 03:01:55.100]  once alex jones is talking about it with the biggest
[03:01:55.100 --> 03:01:58.380]  info warrior action committee on the planet
[03:01:58.380 --> 03:02:01.580]  absolutely it needs to come out completely but rick perry's a gangster
[03:02:01.580 --> 03:02:04.540]  i mean if he'll force shots on girls he knows he's gonna kill him
[03:02:04.540 --> 03:02:07.500]  i don't i don't i mean i don't want to send a hit team over my house and i'll
[03:02:07.500 --> 03:02:11.020]  say right now ladies and gentlemen that if i get killed or something
[03:02:11.020 --> 03:02:14.380]  uh you know where to look i mean i am these people are dangerous
[03:02:14.380 --> 03:02:19.660]  agreed agreed bob Chapman um you had a financial point for bob
[03:02:19.660 --> 03:02:22.380]  on the housing and then we'll get bob's taken and that we'll go to our next
[03:02:22.380 --> 03:02:24.860]  guest yeah bob i guess the question is is how
[03:02:24.860 --> 03:02:27.740]  bad are they going to make this economy they're either going to make obama a
[03:02:27.740 --> 03:02:31.820]  hero or a goat by election 2012 but this economic
[03:02:31.820 --> 03:02:35.740]  implosion that's occurring this second downturn is happening so
[03:02:35.740 --> 03:02:40.220]  fast that home loan demand plunges applications for loans to buy home
[03:02:40.220 --> 03:02:44.620]  dove 9.1 percent just last week to a 13 month low
[03:02:44.620 --> 03:02:48.460]  according to the mortgage bankers association and the uncertainty
[03:02:48.460 --> 03:02:52.220]  has caused a weak stock market as you know so what the what are you thinking
[03:02:52.220 --> 03:02:54.700]  about are they going to make obama a hero or a goat by
[03:02:54.700 --> 03:02:59.260]  november 2012 well i will interject that uh uh two
[03:02:59.260 --> 03:03:03.500]  weeks ago in one week all the gains for the year were wiped out and that was
[03:03:03.500 --> 03:03:07.420]  very frightening um i don't know what they're going to
[03:03:07.420 --> 03:03:11.420]  do with obama and maybe they don't either at this
[03:03:11.420 --> 03:03:15.180]  point uh and i don't think that's important
[03:03:15.180 --> 03:03:21.180]  the important is what you're doing uh getting in uh ron paul to get him in as
[03:03:21.180 --> 03:03:25.100]  president of the united states that's where we
[03:03:25.100 --> 03:03:30.700]  have to really really focus on and uh what happens with the other side and
[03:03:30.700 --> 03:03:34.220]  the other probable uh challenging candidates on the
[03:03:34.220 --> 03:03:38.700]  republican side uh we don't care we just want to make
[03:03:38.700 --> 03:03:42.060]  ron paul the strongest possible candidate
[03:03:42.060 --> 03:03:45.740]  uh the man that's bringing out the truth
[03:03:45.740 --> 03:03:52.060]  and uh he wants to end uh his days in politics
[03:03:52.060 --> 03:03:55.980]  being instrumental in turning the entire country around
[03:03:55.980 --> 03:04:04.380]  and he if we can get him elected he can do that and he's probably our last hope
[03:04:04.380 --> 03:04:08.220]  and maybe we can get a number of more people
[03:04:08.220 --> 03:04:10.780]  like many of the tea party people who were elected
[03:04:10.780 --> 03:04:15.340]  into office to help him because that's the legal
[03:04:15.340 --> 03:04:19.180]  honorable way to do it and by the way they say patriots can't win and can't
[03:04:19.180 --> 03:04:22.620]  take america back that's like saying george washington can't win
[03:04:22.620 --> 03:04:27.420]  or marriott tudman can't win or roza parks can't win we've got to learn
[03:04:27.420 --> 03:04:30.460]  that who wins is who stands up and wants it the most
[03:04:30.460 --> 03:04:34.060]  and stop just giving the field over to the criminals we've got to be bold
[03:04:34.060 --> 03:04:37.900]  fortune favors the bold the fortune we want is liberty is that what you're
[03:04:37.900 --> 03:04:42.060]  saying bob shatman absolutely and our freedom
[03:04:42.060 --> 03:04:46.860]  from these monsters the tireless minority will prevail
[03:04:46.860 --> 03:04:49.500]  look at the tireless minority that is the new world order
[03:04:49.500 --> 03:04:53.820]  we are a much bigger minority than the new world order we can prevail all right
[03:04:53.820 --> 03:04:57.020]  you're gonna keep riding shotgun with us i know bob's busy i'm gonna

[03:08:44.940 --> 03:08:48.620]  now i want to preface this because i know a lot of national media
[03:08:48.620 --> 03:08:55.980]  is tuning in and will be tuning in um mr morrow contacted me
[03:08:55.980 --> 03:08:59.260]  about a month ago he can correct me on the time frame it was about four or five
[03:08:59.260 --> 03:09:02.460]  weeks ago i went and listened to the message to my phone
[03:09:02.460 --> 03:09:07.020]  and the name rungabell and and then i asked around about him and
[03:09:07.020 --> 03:09:10.860]  steve mason who's been doing access tv for 16 years that i've known
[03:09:10.860 --> 03:09:15.820]  and believe me steve mason's no operative uh great patriot uh he knows
[03:09:15.820 --> 03:09:19.660]  morrow and vouchers for him richard reeves i've known for i guess more than a decade
[03:09:19.660 --> 03:09:23.020]  but you've worked with us and gone on uh you know events and shoots
[03:09:23.020 --> 03:09:26.780]  for us for off and on for the last six seven years
[03:09:26.780 --> 03:09:29.820]  you vouched that uh you know he's the real deal he's a real libertarian goes
[03:09:29.820 --> 03:09:32.940]  around knocking on doors with you you know four years ago for ron paul you
[03:09:32.940 --> 03:09:36.700]  knew him years before that and he listened to his message i didn't
[03:09:36.700 --> 03:09:39.660]  call him back because anybody who lives in austin
[03:09:39.660 --> 03:09:46.460]  has heard about rick perry and the reports that he is a philanderer
[03:09:46.460 --> 03:09:50.140]  now listen i'm a christian but i don't get on a moral high horse
[03:09:50.140 --> 03:09:54.380]  okay and sex is not an issue i get into with politicians
[03:09:54.380 --> 03:09:58.060]  i'm i go after rick perry for the forced inoculations of girls with a
[03:09:58.060 --> 03:10:01.100]  dangerous vaccine that they knew was killing people in the trials
[03:10:01.100 --> 03:10:05.340]  trying to hand over 8 000 miles of texas roads to the center of spain
[03:10:05.340 --> 03:10:10.060]  even the legislature said no uh the fact that he worked for al gore
[03:10:10.060 --> 03:10:13.500]  uh as his chief of staff in texas for his campaign
[03:10:13.500 --> 03:10:17.740]  this is all admitted the fact that carl rove is handling him and they
[03:10:17.740 --> 03:10:21.260]  had that fake pledge that he wasn't going to run in 2012 i told you it was
[03:10:21.260 --> 03:10:26.460]  fake then i got creeped out when a fox news host
[03:10:26.460 --> 03:10:30.620]  off record called me and a very well known person i'll just leave it at that
[03:10:30.620 --> 03:10:33.740]  and said rick perry pulled me aside this is last year
[03:10:33.740 --> 03:10:36.860]  and said there's two people i fear and then they added the addendum of a local
[03:10:36.860 --> 03:10:40.300]  politician as well but ron paul and alex shones and i'm like
[03:10:40.300 --> 03:10:44.380]  i don't think of myself as that big i mean sure after drudge
[03:10:44.380 --> 03:10:47.260]  we're bigger in world net daily now bigger than newsmax i mean we're the
[03:10:47.260 --> 03:10:50.060]  biggest thing out there i don't really talk about that because i like to be
[03:10:50.060 --> 03:10:52.780]  under the radar but we're we're growing exponentially but the
[03:10:52.780 --> 03:10:57.820]  establishment knows and the the things that robert maro
[03:10:57.820 --> 03:11:01.180]  talks about is the type of things i've heard but you know
[03:11:01.180 --> 03:11:04.300]  people put out the false statement that you know i work for the vatican or
[03:11:04.300 --> 03:11:07.900]  israel or that i'm a reptoid from planet pop tart so
[03:11:07.900 --> 03:11:11.900]  so i didn't break this story here uh even though you know it's it's
[03:11:11.900 --> 03:11:17.420]  it's uh national news uh i didn't break it here
[03:11:17.420 --> 03:11:22.060]  and i just wanted to wait to see what what came out of it
[03:11:22.060 --> 03:11:25.260]  and so joining us for the next 20 minutes we may even go longer
[03:11:25.260 --> 03:11:29.260]  is uh robert maro and if you go to the washington post
[03:11:29.260 --> 03:11:33.420]  salon hundreds of other publications the headline is have you ever had sex with
[03:11:33.420 --> 03:11:35.980]  rick perry and the ad reads it's going to be in the
[03:11:35.980 --> 03:11:39.740]  chronicle newspaper have you ever had sex with rick perry
[03:11:39.740 --> 03:11:42.940]  are you a stripper an escort or just a young honey impressed
[03:11:42.940 --> 03:11:46.940]  by an arrogant entitled governor of texas contact cash
[03:11:46.940 --> 03:11:50.460]  and we will help you publicize your direct dealings
[03:11:50.460 --> 03:11:55.820]  with the christian buzzword spouting family values hypocrite and fraud
[03:11:55.820 --> 03:12:00.140]  committee against sexual hypocrisy robert maro cash president
[03:12:00.140 --> 03:12:04.300]  and then it's got his phone number and and information so i want to bring him
[03:12:04.300 --> 03:12:08.460]  up now to tell his side of the story because off air you told me
[03:12:08.460 --> 03:12:13.980]  uh that you've got people who tell detailed stories similar stories people
[03:12:13.980 --> 03:12:17.180]  you know the names of strip bars that you're an
[03:12:17.180 --> 03:12:23.180]  aficionado of uh and you're proud of and that
[03:12:23.180 --> 03:12:27.020]  they're scared to go public so that's why you're throwing chum in the water
[03:12:27.020 --> 03:12:31.420]  and and now making this a national story so robert maro you've got the floor
[03:12:31.420 --> 03:12:35.100]  uh tell us your side of things good to be here alex
[03:12:35.100 --> 03:12:39.340]  here's the issue uh rick perry has been living a
[03:12:39.340 --> 03:12:45.900]  rampantly bisexual adulterous double life yet he runs around you know
[03:12:45.900 --> 03:12:50.620]  campaigning on christian values and bible buzzwords and going on the stage
[03:12:50.620 --> 03:12:55.900]  in houston with extremist preachers and spouting a lot of very anti gay
[03:12:55.900 --> 03:12:59.900]  rhetoric um a few years ago here in austin i came
[03:12:59.900 --> 03:13:03.420]  across some young women strippers young hotties
[03:13:03.420 --> 03:13:07.180]  escorts etc but he had direct dealings
[03:13:07.180 --> 03:13:12.860]  with rick perry and his entourage um what the way it works is that rick perry
[03:13:12.860 --> 03:13:18.380]  like tiger woz has an enabling entourage who gets him strippers to play
[03:13:18.380 --> 03:13:21.740]  around with uh who rents the hotel rooms
[03:13:21.740 --> 03:13:26.860]  who calls the escorts services and happened to run across on these women
[03:13:26.860 --> 03:13:30.620]  um one of these women was a the is or was a local
[03:13:30.620 --> 03:13:35.020]  popular stripper here in austin texas and uh she said that one night
[03:13:35.020 --> 03:13:38.380]  that she was up on stage and a man came up to her and he said here's
[03:13:38.380 --> 03:13:42.620]  five hundred dollars that's just for starters that's just for coming with me
[03:13:42.620 --> 03:13:46.220]  and uh she said sure because you know five hundred dollars is
[03:13:46.220 --> 03:13:49.100]  what she would be we'd be making in a whole night through you know table
[03:13:49.100 --> 03:13:52.540]  dances tips etc so she went with a guy
[03:13:52.540 --> 03:13:56.380]  this a couple years ago and so they they took her out and the next thing you
[03:13:56.380 --> 03:14:00.300]  know she was with rick perry and here were and so
[03:14:00.300 --> 03:14:04.380]  when she got rick perry um she started you know playing around with him
[03:14:04.380 --> 03:14:07.500]  you know trying to i'll be not too graphic here trying to give him a
[03:14:07.500 --> 03:14:12.620]  Monica Lewinsky aka oral sex and then here's where her
[03:14:12.620 --> 03:14:16.940]  direct words to me about a few years ago she said
[03:14:16.940 --> 03:14:21.900]  i think he was too coked up to get it up to perform sexually
[03:14:21.900 --> 03:14:25.820]  and then when it came time for her to leave rick perry gave her an outrageous
[03:14:25.820 --> 03:14:30.140]  amount of money willing to the four digits um i think he was trying to keep
[03:14:30.140 --> 03:14:32.940]  her quiet but instead he made a story out of it by
[03:14:32.940 --> 03:14:36.460]  giving her that much money and rick perry is not a very rich man
[03:14:36.460 --> 03:14:40.460]  he's only worth a million or two or so and so it makes me think
[03:14:40.460 --> 03:14:43.660]  that rick perry probably i'm assuming here is taking either
[03:14:43.660 --> 03:14:48.700]  bribes or illegal gifts to the fund his extracurricular activities
[03:14:48.700 --> 03:14:52.300]  well again i'm going to be honest with you i didn't
[03:14:52.300 --> 03:14:55.100]  was it about a month ago you called me how long ago was that you called me
[03:14:55.100 --> 03:14:58.140]  it's not a month ago and i and i knew he got my cell phone
[03:14:58.140 --> 03:15:00.620]  number so i thought wait how does this guy have my cell phone number and then i
[03:15:00.620 --> 03:15:03.900]  asked around they go oh yeah he's a big libertarian activist goes around
[03:15:03.900 --> 03:15:07.420]  knocking on hundreds of doors it turns out about everybody i know
[03:15:07.420 --> 03:15:12.300]  for going back decades knows you and they say no that guy's real
[03:15:12.300 --> 03:15:16.060]  but but at the end of the day how do you know
[03:15:16.060 --> 03:15:20.220]  that strippers aren't lying to you i mean they're notorious liars
[03:15:20.220 --> 03:15:23.900]  well you know who you're gonna believe alex a stripper
[03:15:23.900 --> 03:15:29.900]  an escort or a politician okay it's more than one so then i came across
[03:15:29.900 --> 03:15:34.380]  another young lady who's had direct dealings with rick perry's entourage
[03:15:34.380 --> 03:15:38.380]  and what she told me was this member for entourage told her
[03:15:38.380 --> 03:15:41.580]  he said that when rick perry goes on the road he gets the the
[03:15:41.580 --> 03:15:44.780]  young hotties that was the phrase he used he says that
[03:15:44.780 --> 03:15:48.380]  they take the young hotties back to rick's hotel room they're literally
[03:15:48.380 --> 03:15:52.060]  having orgies and group sex there and it might be you know
[03:15:52.060 --> 03:15:56.540]  rick perry having sex with you know one woman you know on a sofa bed
[03:15:56.540 --> 03:16:00.540]  and his buddy having sex with another young woman on another bed
[03:16:00.540 --> 03:16:04.620]  um these women are about the age of rick perry's
[03:16:04.620 --> 03:16:08.780]  24-year-old daughter sydney they're in their mid 20s well let me just stop you
[03:16:08.780 --> 03:16:12.220]  you know he's come up and and and talk to me in restaurants
[03:16:12.220 --> 03:16:16.460]  and and sent messages to people that he's concerned about me and when he came up
[03:16:16.460 --> 03:16:19.260]  and looked at me at that table and said i want you to have a
[03:16:19.260 --> 03:16:23.980]  i think he even said bless thanksgiving alex he and my handsome was there he
[03:16:23.980 --> 03:16:27.820]  was a witness to it was crazed looking he looks like captain morgan or
[03:16:27.820 --> 03:16:30.780]  something like when he's doing his little governor thing he looks nice you
[03:16:30.780 --> 03:16:34.060]  know friendly he did look psychotic and and i'm
[03:16:34.060 --> 03:16:37.100]  going to be honest he was kind of scary because here's the governor leaning
[03:16:37.100 --> 03:16:39.980]  over looking at me why it was like a vampire like
[03:16:39.980 --> 03:16:43.980]  fright night or something i mean he was really powerfully evil well
[03:16:43.980 --> 03:16:49.180]  alex the reason for that is that rick perry um is sitting on a keg
[03:16:49.180 --> 03:16:52.940]  a slut fueled nitroglycerin that if it ever exploded
[03:16:52.940 --> 03:16:57.420]  would make Anthony weiner look like a mere pimple popping
[03:16:57.420 --> 03:17:01.020]  this second lady who i spoke to she's very credible the reason why
[03:17:01.020 --> 03:17:04.540]  yeah but i don't ever cover sexual issues even when i get stuff
[03:17:04.540 --> 03:17:08.300]  i leave it alone i say i don't want it i've got you here because here it is
[03:17:08.300 --> 03:17:12.380]  it's in full page add the local paper now i can cover it i don't even like
[03:17:12.380 --> 03:17:16.860]  covering it but but i i just want to be on on record that this is not my
[03:17:16.860 --> 03:17:19.900]  this is not my idea you did contact me a month ago and
[03:17:19.900 --> 03:17:23.660]  and i chickened out correct sir yeah that that's correct now let's talk about
[03:17:23.660 --> 03:17:26.620]  the second lady why she's so credible of course i'm not gonna name any names
[03:17:26.620 --> 03:17:29.500]  because these these women but for whatever reason
[03:17:29.500 --> 03:17:33.580]  have decided not to come forward the the reason i ran this ad is an appeal
[03:17:33.580 --> 03:17:37.340]  for for people for for strippers escort young hotties
[03:17:37.340 --> 03:17:41.580]  and gay lovers to quit covering for this guy you know come forward and find a
[03:17:41.580 --> 03:17:45.180]  reporter i'll find you a good one if you don't want to go on the record you can
[03:17:45.180 --> 03:17:49.740]  at least be background material but it's very important to expose to america
[03:17:49.740 --> 03:17:52.860]  who rick perry is and how he behaves in such a hypocritical
[03:17:52.860 --> 03:17:57.100]  let me stop you if this stuff's real yep and if you're
[03:17:57.100 --> 03:18:00.860]  not being fed a line of bull uh maybe they went and picked an activist out
[03:18:00.860 --> 03:18:04.220]  this just has carl roe written all over it if it is staged
[03:18:04.220 --> 03:18:07.260]  as a scythe to get us away from all the real issues
[03:18:07.260 --> 03:18:11.580]  if if this is real you don't have time with these women and these men
[03:18:11.580 --> 03:18:15.020]  to have them go talk to a reporter in the in the newspaper then
[03:18:15.020 --> 03:18:18.940]  editors will block these stories they've got to go on youtube now
[03:18:18.940 --> 03:18:22.700]  they've got to call a press conference listen to me tomorrow i told the dc
[03:18:22.700 --> 03:18:27.900]  madam this i told gary webb uh who was trying to send me info and
[03:18:27.900 --> 03:18:30.700]  stuff right before he was killed and he said i want to come on your show once
[03:18:30.700 --> 03:18:33.420]  the new book comes out and i said if you've got all this stuff don't even
[03:18:33.420 --> 03:18:36.060]  tell me over the phone you've got to go public now
[03:18:36.060 --> 03:18:39.500]  and then they came and shot him twice in the head i'm tell you know about how
[03:18:39.500 --> 03:18:43.180]  many people bill clinton had killed in arkansas to cover stuff up like this
[03:18:43.180 --> 03:18:46.620]  with women i'm just telling you if this is real buddy
[03:18:46.620 --> 03:18:51.820]  i'm telling you you are a dead man if you don't get this information out and
[03:18:51.820 --> 03:18:55.260]  quit and all these other women and men they're going to start getting killed
[03:18:55.260 --> 03:18:58.780]  and i'm not talking about by rick perry but by the corporate interest
[03:18:58.780 --> 03:19:02.940]  that walk up and say hey we're here to help you well alex you know
[03:19:02.940 --> 03:19:06.220]  that's why it's important for people to come public you get a little measure of
[03:19:06.220 --> 03:19:09.580]  safety when you become public because you're a public figure back to the
[03:19:09.580 --> 03:19:13.100]  second one no you get the only measure of of safety the fact
[03:19:13.100 --> 03:19:16.700]  that you're here now and i'm talking about this gives it some protection
[03:19:16.700 --> 03:19:20.060]  all right secondly i'm gonna walk you through all the reason it's so credible
[03:19:20.060 --> 03:19:23.820]  it's because so many people have talked with this okay so the second woman
[03:19:23.820 --> 03:19:27.100]  is it was very credible the one who had dealings with rick perry's entourage
[03:19:27.100 --> 03:19:31.660]  she is she's educated she knows her way around the political world here in
[03:19:31.660 --> 03:19:36.060]  austin texas and she was just leveling with me and so she's not like some you
[03:19:36.060 --> 03:19:41.020]  know 17 year old runaway on drugs uh she's you know she's completely
[03:19:41.020 --> 03:19:44.940]  credible the third person is a young lady who knows
[03:19:44.940 --> 03:19:48.540]  one of the top popular escorts in austin
[03:19:48.540 --> 03:19:52.380]  who was either here or used to be here and she said that um
[03:19:52.380 --> 03:19:57.900]  this way this other escort had um uh i tripped with rick perry in one of the
[03:19:57.900 --> 03:20:00.860]  nicer hotels here in austin so that's three sources i want to
[03:20:00.860 --> 03:20:05.900]  want folks to know this i'm not 99 percent sure that rick perry is a rampant
[03:20:05.900 --> 03:20:11.340]  adulterer i'm 100 percent sure now now richard
[03:20:11.340 --> 03:20:14.140]  reeves is here richard you've known this guy you said five six years yeah i know

[03:20:18.060 --> 03:20:22.300]  in his neighborhood and canvas for ron paul in the past but robert is a big
[03:20:22.300 --> 03:20:26.940]  believer in a statement that you frequently make where you say duty is ours
[03:20:26.940 --> 03:20:31.900]  consequences are gods and robert i know that you live by this as well
[03:20:31.900 --> 03:20:37.660]  absolutely richard and what this ad is folks for the all the folks out
[03:20:37.660 --> 03:20:40.380]  listen there millions of americans right here

[03:21:02.380 --> 03:21:06.380]  you and i and many others have heard many many rumors about rick perry
[03:21:06.380 --> 03:21:11.580]  uh being a homosexual or having gay affairs i have asked state police at
[03:21:11.580 --> 03:21:15.900]  the capital high level off record years ago and i said is there any truth to
[03:21:15.900 --> 03:21:18.460]  this stuff and they just said you don't even
[03:21:18.460 --> 03:21:22.220]  want to know and i said well tell me and they're like no way
[03:21:22.220 --> 03:21:27.900]  yeah well what it is alex is that is rick perry is not just gay he's bisexual
[03:21:27.900 --> 03:21:34.300]  okay so this monday on on the uh the 15th i believe i got a phone call
[03:21:34.300 --> 03:21:38.540]  from a an incensed homosexual and he told me this he says robert
[03:21:38.540 --> 03:21:42.220]  after seeing rick perry on that stage in houston with all those extremist
[03:21:42.220 --> 03:21:46.460]  preachers you know the ones who are you know extra double extra anti-gay
[03:21:46.460 --> 03:21:51.100]  father rhetoric i just can't take it anymore he says that he said to me
[03:21:51.100 --> 03:21:55.180]  my ex's ex had sex with rick perry a gay fling
[03:21:55.180 --> 03:21:58.780]  with rick years ago before he became governor
[03:21:58.780 --> 03:22:01.980]  and so me and my friend we're gonna try and talk him to go in public okay well
[03:22:01.980 --> 03:22:05.180]  why haven't you just gone to the press and maybe i've missed it
[03:22:05.180 --> 03:22:10.380]  and talked about all this uh why are you running the ad just to get other
[03:22:10.380 --> 03:22:13.340]  people even more to come forward i mean how do you know they're not going to
[03:22:13.340 --> 03:22:17.580]  put a fake person forward who later than recants i mean
[03:22:17.580 --> 03:22:21.020]  here's what i'm saying why not go after rick perry
[03:22:21.020 --> 03:22:24.300]  for forced inoculations with a shot he knew it was killing people in the
[03:22:24.300 --> 03:22:28.460]  trials why not the highways handed over to foreign
[03:22:28.460 --> 03:22:32.380]  companies why not i mean i i just got a bad feeling
[03:22:32.380 --> 03:22:36.940]  about this whole thing or even rick perry's dirty real estate
[03:22:36.940 --> 03:22:40.300]  deals any national media listening you need to learn about the horseshoe bay
[03:22:40.300 --> 03:22:43.500]  real estate deal where they sold in the land listen i want to stop right there
[03:22:43.500 --> 03:22:45.740]  because i haven't had time to vet any of that okay
[03:22:45.740 --> 03:22:49.020]  all right that came out in major mainstream okay man i remember hearing
[03:22:49.020 --> 03:22:52.620]  about about okay richard do you go ahead well i don't recall the exact details
[03:22:52.620 --> 03:22:55.820]  i'm sure robert knows all the chapter and verse but that was in mainstream
[03:22:55.820 --> 03:22:58.860]  press the horseshoe bay store did let me try it i remember seeing it the
[03:22:58.860 --> 03:23:02.780]  process it was covered by the dallas morning news they detailed it in in the
[03:23:02.780 --> 03:23:05.900]  fall of 2010 before the governor's election
[03:23:05.900 --> 03:23:09.500]  exactly i do remember it was they were selling rick perry a lot at
[03:23:09.500 --> 03:23:13.900]  way under market value like it there were lots worth $450,000
[03:23:13.900 --> 03:23:17.660]  his friends gave it gave it to him for 300 no that's like hillary and and the
[03:23:17.660 --> 03:23:21.500]  cattle futures they only gave them winners the oldest payoff in the book
[03:23:21.500 --> 03:23:24.860]  is they wink wink buy this for nothing we'll buy it for three times what it's
[03:23:24.860 --> 03:23:28.140]  worth or wink wink we'll we'll sell you stuff at half price
[03:23:28.140 --> 03:23:31.900]  seven years later when the lot was market value based on comparable's worth
[03:23:31.900 --> 03:23:34.940]  $800,000 another crony paid rick perry
[03:23:34.940 --> 03:23:38.540]  $1.1 million at $2,000 so what's the common theme here
[03:23:38.540 --> 03:23:43.260]  the common theme here is rick perry crony capitalism
[03:23:43.260 --> 03:23:48.220]  corruption and compromise in his personal life well here it is you you brought
[03:23:48.220 --> 03:23:52.780]  that up and it's statesman dot com bill whiteblast rick perry on horseshoe bay
[03:23:52.780 --> 03:23:55.580]  land deal texas governor defense transaction is
[03:23:55.580 --> 03:23:58.700]  above board the national committee needs to
[03:23:58.700 --> 03:24:02.780]  re-reput that story up again right there that was especially egregious and
[03:24:02.780 --> 03:24:06.620]  flavor right there but back to the the womanizing and the manizing of rick
[03:24:06.620 --> 03:24:09.580]  perry now what you say you got three women but
[03:24:09.580 --> 03:24:12.540]  you've got one guy calling you i mean from what i've seen the press of the
[03:24:12.540 --> 03:24:16.940]  year gays are notorious for making stuff up
[03:24:16.940 --> 03:24:21.900]  so are women this guy caught me alex three days before my ad went up he just saw
[03:24:21.900 --> 03:24:25.900]  one of my posts on the internet okay and i sent him to a reporter who's
[03:24:25.900 --> 03:24:28.380]  investigating is there's several reporters that were going through this
[03:24:28.380 --> 03:24:31.740]  and it but it takes time for them to work their leads it might get oh there's no
[03:24:31.740 --> 03:24:35.500]  way the editors are gonna let this out they only put editors over major papers
[03:24:35.500 --> 03:24:40.860]  who've got more dirt on them pay perry i predict a story confirming rick perry's
[03:24:40.860 --> 03:24:45.580]  homosexuality will be out by christmas because they've got to work
[03:24:45.580 --> 03:24:48.060]  delete they've got to work on work on work on
[03:24:48.060 --> 03:24:51.740]  it's just too credible say i want to say something else alex and your listeners
[03:24:51.740 --> 03:24:55.660]  living here in austin and by the way i'm a three-time delegate to the texas
[03:24:55.660 --> 03:25:00.060]  republican convention 2006 2008 2010 so i'm not some sort of liberal democrat
[03:25:00.060 --> 03:25:03.980]  making this up leaves his nodding his head he's the delegate as well yeah
[03:25:03.980 --> 03:25:10.540]  i voted for rick perry 1998 2002 2006 i'll never vote for him again
[03:25:10.540 --> 03:25:14.780]  okay all right having said all that
[03:25:14.780 --> 03:25:19.020]  um the gay rumors that you and i've heard i never believed them for years they've
[03:25:19.020 --> 03:25:22.220]  been around here for about eight years since since 2004 when there was an
[03:25:22.220 --> 03:25:25.660]  allegation that you know rick perry was having a gay affair with the
[03:25:25.660 --> 03:25:30.700]  texas secretary of state i think his name was what what jeff connor or something
[03:25:30.700 --> 03:25:33.660]  i remember i remember the news reporting on the gay rumors i don't remember the
[03:25:33.660 --> 03:25:38.140]  names okay and i never believed that alex and then i never believed it once i
[03:25:38.140 --> 03:25:41.100]  found out about the woman i think i figured what rick's just like me you
[03:25:41.100 --> 03:25:45.420]  know he's like he likes the cuties and everything he likes the strippers etc
[03:25:45.420 --> 03:25:49.180]  alex no more the gay rumors are completely
[03:25:49.180 --> 03:25:53.340]  credible this guy is a rampaging bisexual
[03:25:53.340 --> 03:25:57.740]  adulterer and all of that and what what is this show which shows he's arrogant
[03:25:57.740 --> 03:26:02.220]  he's entitled and he's reckless and folks we don't need arrogant and reckless in
[03:26:02.220 --> 03:26:04.780]  the white house
[03:26:06.780 --> 03:26:10.780]  oh man i tell you what i'm gonna be start wearing a bulletproof vest for this
[03:26:10.780 --> 03:26:14.220]  stuff on my show well i think it's all gonna come
[03:26:14.220 --> 03:26:17.820]  up to a head pretty quickly here with uh all this exposure that it's coming on
[03:26:17.820 --> 03:26:21.020]  this show and uh with robert morrow placing these ads so
[03:26:21.020 --> 03:26:23.980]  we're going to find out pretty quick these people are going to have to come
[03:26:23.980 --> 03:26:26.620]  forward uh because like you said and you've
[03:26:26.620 --> 03:26:31.180]  been uncannily right over the years people are going to die over this if
[03:26:31.180 --> 03:26:34.460]  they don't come on out and hit the press immediately
[03:26:34.460 --> 03:26:37.740]  honestly you're you're safer but you're safer going public than
[03:26:37.740 --> 03:26:41.340]  than being secret um well that's that's that's an understatement
[03:26:41.340 --> 03:26:45.260]  yeah it really is if you because if you stay secret and they know about it um
[03:26:45.260 --> 03:26:49.020]  then they can can well i'm going to be honest that's why you're even on this
[03:26:49.020 --> 03:26:52.780]  show because i'm in austin i know perry's already scared of me
[03:26:52.780 --> 03:26:55.900]  uh for whatever reason it's for and it's kind of creepy to have some of this
[03:26:55.900 --> 03:26:57.980]  powerful you know you actually know therek rick perry
[03:26:57.980 --> 03:27:01.820]  except to maybe annihilate his political career
[03:27:01.820 --> 03:27:06.060]  well i just don't know why a year and 14 months ago he told a fox host this
[03:27:06.060 --> 03:27:09.660]  behind closed doors came over in cornering well i guess you're a listener
[03:27:09.660 --> 03:27:13.900]  you know i talked about that last year sure and said he he's scared of ron paul
[03:27:13.900 --> 03:27:18.380]  and alex jones and i just i'm like why me and i guess he knows
[03:27:18.380 --> 03:27:22.220]  i'm here local i'm media he doesn't control
[03:27:22.220 --> 03:27:27.500]  and uh you know the thing is i don't have some
[03:27:27.500 --> 03:27:31.900]  political beef with perry i'm not even after him as an individual
[03:27:31.900 --> 03:27:35.820]  um you mean personal if you have a political base just like
[03:27:35.820 --> 03:27:40.140]  just like i do well exactly but but it's just
[03:27:40.140 --> 03:27:44.140]  all these republicans that get caught with their pages and in bathrooms and
[03:27:44.140 --> 03:27:47.660]  bohemian grove and the reports of obama
[03:27:47.660 --> 03:27:51.420]  i think they only promote people who have this type of background
[03:27:51.420 --> 03:27:55.660]  because they can then control them i was just thinking about rick perry
[03:27:55.660 --> 03:27:59.020]  whether he's more suited for bilderberg or bohemian grove
[03:27:59.020 --> 03:28:02.380]  i kind of i kind of feel that when rick perry went to bilderberg
[03:28:02.380 --> 03:28:06.620]  he was probably like uh an eighth grader in a college calculus class
[03:28:06.620 --> 03:28:10.460]  that they knew they had a dumb bunny on their hands but i think rick might be a
[03:28:10.460 --> 03:28:14.540]  little more at home uh running around howling in the woods at bohemian grove
[03:28:14.540 --> 03:28:18.220]  that's my personal opinion you know i don't get that rick perry's
[03:28:18.220 --> 03:28:21.740]  dumb to me he's extremely slick and smart
[03:28:21.740 --> 03:28:25.980]  well if you're running around with all the women and young men that he has
[03:28:25.980 --> 03:28:30.300]  and you think you're too stupid to not think they're gonna talk one day
[03:28:30.300 --> 03:28:33.900]  that's pretty dumb and we will know if you study psychology
[03:28:33.900 --> 03:28:37.020]  if any of this is true and these people aren't lying to you i have no doubt
[03:28:37.020 --> 03:28:41.260]  you're being told this if if if this is true it's part
[03:28:41.260 --> 03:28:45.340]  for the course these are reckless personalities these are narcissist
[03:28:45.340 --> 03:28:49.500]  this is what narcissists do i mean i mean you don't think that over the years
[03:28:49.500 --> 03:28:52.780]  i haven't had women come on to me and stuff but at the end of the day and
[03:28:52.780 --> 03:28:55.660]  nobody's perfect but but at the end of the day you've got a family you've got a
[03:28:55.660 --> 03:29:00.380]  wife you can't just be an animal who has no responsibility
[03:29:00.380 --> 03:29:04.700]  you know the austin me you wrote about the way uh anita perry will almost never
[03:29:04.700 --> 03:29:07.660]  kiss rick perry in public uh john kelso wrote a
[03:29:07.660 --> 03:29:12.380]  wrote a column you guys can google this it says uh somebody needs to goose
[03:29:12.380 --> 03:29:17.020]  i need a perry to get a smile out of her it was so obvious in the 2010 campaign
[03:29:17.020 --> 03:29:21.260]  that she was not uh forced out what i do is she really didn't he run an ad four
[03:29:21.260 --> 03:29:24.380]  years ago where he said my wife and i love each other
[03:29:24.380 --> 03:29:29.420]  oh he tweets this is what's so outrageous he tweets how blessed he is
[03:29:29.420 --> 03:29:32.860]  he talks about her and compares her to biblical verses
[03:29:32.860 --> 03:29:37.980]  and yet he's running around with some of the girls i see how well
[03:29:37.980 --> 03:29:41.260]  well we do again these women have told you this reportedly

[03:34:42.540 --> 03:34:47.340]  austin texas or around the country that you know can expose rick perry for who

[03:35:36.700 --> 03:35:40.140]  was because of a breaking scandal over a centennial

[03:42:54.300 --> 03:42:58.380]  hey robert comment on uh that big rally head in houston that rick perry uh
[03:42:58.380 --> 03:43:01.980]  basically utilizing all those well-meaning christians to
[03:43:01.980 --> 03:43:06.140]  campaign for him rick perry is abusing um the
[03:43:06.140 --> 03:43:11.740]  minds and the hearts of millions of christians in america because
[03:43:11.740 --> 03:43:16.140]  he's telling them that you know he's all for traditional marriage
[03:43:16.140 --> 03:43:19.660]  when his concept of traditional marriage is exact same as uh
[03:43:19.660 --> 03:43:23.980]  john edwards and bill clinton um he uses a lot of christian terminology in
[03:43:23.980 --> 03:43:27.180]  bible talk he he has a rally in houston which was
[03:43:27.180 --> 03:43:32.220]  really to further his own presidential ambitions
[03:43:32.220 --> 03:43:36.220]  yet as far as i know the man is a rampant
[03:43:36.220 --> 03:43:39.900]  bisexual adulterer that's that's the information that i'm all right let me
[03:43:39.900 --> 03:43:42.780]  throw this out the guys have found a news article i believe that news article
[03:43:42.780 --> 03:43:46.220]  has the link to the expense account because i want to just confirm for
[03:43:46.220 --> 03:43:48.620]  myself i know you guys are saying you've seen the reports but
[03:43:48.620 --> 03:43:53.020]  that's unconfirmed to me at this point but if it's true that he's visiting
[03:43:53.020 --> 03:43:59.500]  uh men in drag i mean cabaret shows that is a gigantic piece of evidence right
[03:43:59.500 --> 03:44:03.820]  there i mean yeah and his his campaign says oh that was anita
[03:44:03.820 --> 03:44:07.900]  just like rick perry says that anita is telling him to run for president
[03:44:07.900 --> 03:44:12.300]  well my response to that is did anita did anita take to play with the strippers
[03:44:12.300 --> 03:44:16.540]  the hookers the young hotties did anita take to run for governor in 2010
[03:44:16.540 --> 03:44:19.500]  charlie ever showed up at work hardly ever showed up at one of your rallies
[03:44:19.500 --> 03:44:23.340]  when she did she never smiled always had a funny look on her face now i hear you
[03:44:23.340 --> 03:44:25.660]  i want to get to some calls but let's bring do in here
[03:44:25.660 --> 03:44:30.860]  do just got back he was in the other side of the studio uh this is uh

[03:45:30.860 --> 03:45:35.580]  there in the small princess texas ethics no it says texas ethics commission but
[03:45:35.580 --> 03:45:39.500]  i want to read this on their website they've got these filings
[03:45:39.500 --> 03:45:44.940]  you can look up the date 41309 well we'll just track all this down
[03:45:44.940 --> 03:45:48.620]  if this is true and this is unconfirmed even though i've got some news articles
[03:45:48.620 --> 03:45:51.340]  about it and things from years ago if this is true
[03:45:51.340 --> 03:45:55.260]  this is smoking gun i've got another one for you alex and this is the way this
[03:45:55.260 --> 03:45:58.940]  works there are a lot of hearsay rumors and here's one from one of your listeners
[03:45:58.940 --> 03:46:02.780]  one of your avid listeners told me this one i can't tell you his name
[03:46:02.780 --> 03:46:07.180]  he said that one that his friend was a former
[03:46:07.180 --> 03:46:11.100]  dancer a male dancer at i think maybe a gay bar
[03:46:11.100 --> 03:46:15.660]  or a gay male review here in austin years ago
[03:46:15.660 --> 03:46:18.860]  and that rick perry was a frequent customer there and so i went to this
[03:46:18.860 --> 03:46:23.100]  guy i said hey man you know we we got to we got to expose this guy perry for
[03:46:23.100 --> 03:46:26.140]  who he is he said he said to me he texted me he said
[03:46:26.140 --> 03:46:30.060]  not interested no thanks but then i texted him again i said look man i know
[03:46:30.060 --> 03:46:34.140]  strippers hookers young hotties that i can't get to talk
[03:46:34.140 --> 03:46:37.260]  you know somebody needs to step forward and then he texted me again as one of
[03:46:37.260 --> 03:46:40.860]  your listeners he said um i've already told you once
[03:46:40.860 --> 03:46:44.220]  not interested in buying so he's protecting his friend but the folks
[03:46:44.220 --> 03:46:48.460]  they didn't know this is that if if people like that dancer don't want to go
[03:46:48.460 --> 03:46:52.780]  public that former dancer i should say they can still give reporters
[03:46:52.780 --> 03:46:56.940]  background information on rick perry's double life and let them build a case and
[03:46:56.940 --> 03:47:00.700]  build a story and it'll support somebody else who will come forward
[03:47:00.700 --> 03:47:03.580]  well i think this is a big enough story we're going to find out the truth now
[03:47:03.580 --> 03:47:06.860]  conventionally um let's
[03:47:06.860 --> 03:47:11.180]  yeah i know we can show the expense report is it have we found it on the state
[03:47:11.180 --> 03:47:14.540]  ethics commission site
[03:47:15.980 --> 03:47:18.700]  oh he was there
[03:47:19.260 --> 03:47:24.620]  no no absolutely so we have not found it on the ethics commission document
[03:47:24.620 --> 03:47:26.460]  yet so we're going to continue to look at that thank you
[03:47:26.460 --> 03:47:30.620]  okay let's go to uh let's go to steve in texas
[03:47:30.620 --> 03:47:33.260]  and then cathrin and others go ahead steve you're on the air
[03:47:33.260 --> 03:47:37.100]  hey alex thanks for taking my calls first time caller just wanted to first
[03:47:37.100 --> 03:47:40.380]  start out by saying i know uh i know both richard and uh robert
[03:47:40.380 --> 03:47:42.940]  personally and i would attest that they are uh
[03:47:42.940 --> 03:47:46.940]  they're the real deal when it comes to patriots uh my question is
[03:47:46.940 --> 03:47:51.420]  has to do with clinton and has you guys started to touch on a little bit
[03:47:51.420 --> 03:47:54.300]  after i call ahead or it was already way on hold but
[03:47:54.300 --> 03:47:58.780]  i'm curious uh you know clinton had a lot of flandering and uh and never was
[03:47:58.780 --> 03:48:02.380]  able to to really gain any traction on any of that i think you pointed out a
[03:48:02.380 --> 03:48:08.220]  lot of them ended up dead uh and other accidents but what robert my
[03:48:08.220 --> 03:48:12.220]  question for you is what why would you think that uh because i was in the
[03:48:12.220 --> 03:48:15.900]  in the state caucus last year when you brought up the
[03:48:15.900 --> 03:48:19.180]  the same issue back i guess that was more than a year ago
[03:48:19.180 --> 03:48:24.060]  um what makes you think that we'll be able to get any traction on any of this
[03:48:24.060 --> 03:48:27.420]  well it's time to take it to the next level and we've we've got national
[03:48:27.420 --> 03:48:31.500]  publicity on this we've got a lot local awesome publicity
[03:48:31.500 --> 03:48:35.340]  again the whole point of the ad was this is that there are many people out
[03:48:35.340 --> 03:48:39.100]  there probably who've had dealings with rick perry
[03:48:39.100 --> 03:48:43.260]  either they they they had sex with him or they had friends who had sex with him
[03:48:43.260 --> 03:48:46.060]  in a adulterous way and it's time for these folks
[03:48:46.060 --> 03:48:50.780]  to quit take it out of the rumor land and go on the record tell your story if
[03:48:50.780 --> 03:48:53.020]  not that tell your story to a reporter on
[03:48:53.020 --> 03:48:57.980]  background my email address is family values hypocritic at gmail.com
[03:48:57.980 --> 03:49:02.380]  all right um thank you steve let's talk to catherine
[03:49:02.380 --> 03:49:07.020]  in texas catherine you're on the air go ahead hi i have three comments um i'm
[03:49:07.020 --> 03:49:11.020]  from florida and um q west is absolutely an alternative
[03:49:11.020 --> 03:49:14.060]  place everywhere everywhere you go is gay it's it's hard
[03:49:14.060 --> 03:49:17.100]  pressing to get someplace where it's not a gay place
[03:49:17.100 --> 03:49:21.260]  the second thing is i know that we should focus on political issues with
[03:49:21.260 --> 03:49:24.380]  politicians but our country and the way that it is
[03:49:24.380 --> 03:49:27.980]  philosophy is what matters and i know pastors in texas
[03:49:27.980 --> 03:49:32.220]  who swear by rick perry so maybe this is where i will take to let them see who he
[03:49:32.220 --> 03:49:35.340]  really is that's right sweetheart that's right ma'am
[03:49:35.340 --> 03:49:39.260]  and then the third comment is that um i just called the gop office in san
[03:49:39.260 --> 03:49:42.940]  antonio and they changed the application for
[03:49:42.940 --> 03:49:47.340]  policing registration to december 13 and it has to be received
[03:49:47.340 --> 03:49:50.700]  by them by december 12th or they won't take it
[03:49:50.700 --> 03:49:54.540]  and i think it's good that this thing's come out because terry is a real slime
[03:49:54.540 --> 03:49:57.260]  ball and he's really rolling a lot of christians
[03:49:57.260 --> 03:50:01.820]  and this thing needs to go so viral to the point that
[03:50:01.820 --> 03:50:05.820]  christians understand maybe the corridor doesn't matter but this does
[03:50:05.820 --> 03:50:09.820]  thank you all right uh yeah there you maybe making little girls take shots
[03:50:09.820 --> 03:50:14.460]  that kill them doesn't matter but this does it's just insane the whole thing
[03:50:14.460 --> 03:50:19.260]  um let's it's a matter of character alex you know people ask me you know
[03:50:19.260 --> 03:50:23.500]  they'll compare a politician to a whore here's the difference between a whore
[03:50:23.500 --> 03:50:27.420]  and a politician alex a whore will only do a few
[03:50:27.420 --> 03:50:31.340]  certain things for money but a politician like rick perry will do
[03:50:31.340 --> 03:50:35.740]  anything for money oh power
[03:50:35.740 --> 03:50:39.020]  oh boy uh let's come back and talk to seth

[03:54:12.460 --> 03:54:19.180]  back this sunday 4 to 6 p.m robert morrow is our guest and
[03:54:19.180 --> 03:54:23.900]  again i shot away from this a month ago because of the name rungabelle but then
[03:54:23.900 --> 03:54:27.180]  since this broke i did more research and found out a lot of people are vouching
[03:54:27.180 --> 03:54:32.300]  for robert and and now it appears these are the official expense reports
[03:54:32.300 --> 03:54:35.900]  just in the email that's posted on obama site there's hundreds and hundreds of
[03:54:35.900 --> 03:54:39.020]  pages of them and so we're going to ferret that out
[03:54:39.020 --> 03:54:41.820]  we found news articles from two years ago reporting that indeed
[03:54:41.820 --> 03:54:46.380]  the latida thing latida did did happen
[03:54:46.380 --> 03:54:51.340]  and so if well this just demonstrates what a bulldog robert morrow is because
[03:54:51.340 --> 03:54:56.060]  he's been the number one catalyst on this aspect of rick perry
[03:54:56.060 --> 03:55:00.060]  and i know he's been working at it for two or three months if not longer and
[03:55:00.060 --> 03:55:02.780]  very here the document cam we did find it even though
[03:55:02.780 --> 03:55:06.220]  it was in the news i don't believe it this is from the state of texas
[03:55:06.220 --> 03:55:09.900]  ethics committee can i have a document cam shot here thank you
[03:55:09.900 --> 03:55:17.180]  ethics.state.texas.us forward slash php forward slash f search simple php you
[03:55:17.180 --> 03:55:20.140]  go to the texas ethics commission you top in law
[03:55:20.140 --> 03:55:27.900]  dash t dash da texas for rick perry business meeting and reportedly he
[03:55:27.900 --> 03:55:32.300]  was at that and this is the seventy eight dollars that was spent
[03:55:32.300 --> 03:55:35.340]  and the news is reporting that he was reportedly there but
[03:55:35.340 --> 03:55:39.100]  robert you're saying he's spending this to say that sorry to interrupt he just
[03:55:39.100 --> 03:55:41.900]  brought this into me you know i'm the king of that
[03:55:41.900 --> 03:55:46.940]  yeah he's been to say that oh that was in need of going there not me
[03:55:46.940 --> 03:55:52.220]  you know which is which is baloney you know and uh just because you go to a
[03:55:52.220 --> 03:55:57.820]  all male gay drag review doesn't mean you're gay but the point is the rumors
[03:55:57.820 --> 03:56:02.700]  on rick perry's homosexuality here in austin are voluminous
[03:56:02.700 --> 03:56:08.300]  intense and they will not go away and we need to we need to move beyond the uh
[03:56:08.300 --> 03:56:12.380]  the hearsay stage and have folks come forward go on their record
[03:56:12.380 --> 03:56:16.140]  and expose this this fraud for what he is uh you were trying to say something
[03:56:16.140 --> 03:56:18.940]  richer when i was given the actual state of texas report
[03:56:18.940 --> 03:56:22.780]  well i was just referring to robert maro's hard work on this he's definitely
[03:56:22.780 --> 03:56:26.060]  been a bulldog and he's a great researcher he's done a lot of research
[03:56:26.060 --> 03:56:29.900]  he's researched jfk you could have him on as a guest for the jfk coming up in
[03:56:29.900 --> 03:56:33.580]  november robert maro is an encyclopedia about the jfk
[03:56:33.580 --> 03:56:37.660]  issue as well so the guy does a lot of work and footwork and research
[03:56:37.660 --> 03:56:41.820]  and him bringing this to fruition here on the alex jones show today
[03:56:41.820 --> 03:56:45.020]  is the result of a lot of work on his part to bring it
[03:56:45.020 --> 03:56:48.140]  well you know though i don't do your i don't i don't do sexual scandals you
[03:56:48.140 --> 03:56:51.740]  recognize that i know i know uh just because i mean this crux got enough
[03:56:51.740 --> 03:56:55.260]  evidence as it is we can get him on a million other things
[03:56:55.260 --> 03:56:59.820]  that he's done it relates to his crony capitalism you know the age of the same
[03:56:59.820 --> 03:57:02.860]  folks who are doing the hbv the same folks who are pushing the toll roads the
[03:57:02.860 --> 03:57:07.180]  same folks who are pushing all the in my opinion crooked real estate deals
[03:57:07.180 --> 03:57:10.460]  they're his cronies who do you think he's running around with when they rent
[03:57:10.460 --> 03:57:14.940]  a nice hotel here in austin texas and they call up the escort services
[03:57:14.940 --> 03:57:18.940]  and and comp rick perry a night of fun and games
[03:57:18.940 --> 03:57:23.500]  right that doesn't sound fun to me
