[00:00.000 --> 00:14.160]  Live from London, England, it's Paul Joseph Watson with Summit.News.
[00:14.160 --> 00:19.440]  And we are live on this Monday, February 3rd edition of the show, The Man, the Myth, the
[00:19.440 --> 00:25.240]  meme, the legend Alex Jones himself will be coming up at the bottom of the next hour.
[00:25.240 --> 00:31.640]  But before that, we have an absolute plethora of news items to run through here today.
[00:31.640 --> 00:35.680]  Of course, we had the Super Bowl last night, the biggest TV broadcast in America for the
[00:35.680 --> 00:40.880]  year, as far as I know, and once again, it was a carnival of degeneracy.
[00:40.880 --> 00:46.120]  We're going to get into that specifically, the halftime show and of course, the commercials
[00:46.120 --> 00:50.880]  which were woke beyond belief and that's putting it sympathetically.
[00:50.880 --> 00:55.280]  We've got headlines like this, CNN's Ana Navarro says Super Bowl halftime show proves
[00:55.280 --> 01:01.040]  need for unlimited third world immigration because they had performances by Jennifer
[01:01.040 --> 01:08.280]  Lopez and Shakira who performed songs almost exclusively written by white people, white
[01:08.280 --> 01:09.280]  Americans.
[01:09.280 --> 01:13.760]  So that proves the need for unlimited mass immigration, according to Ana Navarro.
[01:13.760 --> 01:19.480]  Super Bowl 2020 middle-aged strippers lip-sync tunes in Spanish, yes, this is coming from
[01:19.480 --> 01:26.200]  the same corporate media industrial complex, in this case, the NFL and Pepsi Company, which
[01:26.200 --> 01:32.600]  will get up and virtue signal all day about respecting women's role in the workplace,
[01:32.600 --> 01:35.920]  the Me Too movement, et cetera, et cetera.
[01:35.920 --> 01:39.560]  And then they'll have their performers get up on stage and twerk and stick out their
[01:39.560 --> 01:46.920]  tongues and do strip club pole dances for the impressionable viewing intake of, in many
[01:46.920 --> 01:50.800]  cases, teenage girls, I've made this point over and over again.
[01:50.800 --> 01:51.960]  So we're going to get into that.
[01:51.960 --> 01:57.280]  We have a headline here out of National File, Super Bowl halftime show featured pole dancing,
[01:57.280 --> 01:58.280]  strip club mimicry.
[01:58.280 --> 02:02.960]  We're going to get into that, we're going to get into the latest with the coronavirus
[02:02.960 --> 02:09.680]  and we're going to get into the latest terrorist attack, Islamic terrorist attack in London,
[02:09.680 --> 02:15.720]  which seems like it's every month at this point, yet again a terrorist who was imprisoned
[02:15.720 --> 02:22.400]  for a period of three years and four months, despite a litany of terror offenses, once again
[02:22.400 --> 02:28.880]  released early out on the streets, and it was only thankfully again, to the quick response
[02:28.880 --> 02:33.440]  of anti-terror police that he was shot dead, a lot of people on Twitter again, not happy
[02:33.440 --> 02:36.640]  that terrorists are being shot dead on the streets.
[02:36.640 --> 02:43.320]  But again, he was released halfway through his sentence, ISIS is now claiming credibility,
[02:43.320 --> 02:46.840]  claiming ownership of that terrorist attack.
[02:46.840 --> 02:51.640]  So we're going to get into exactly what the attacker, Sudesh, a man did to deserve that
[02:51.640 --> 02:57.480]  prison sentence, why Islamic radicalization in prisons in the UK is a massive problem
[02:57.480 --> 03:03.520]  and nothing is being done to stop it and why these terrorists are being released early.
[03:03.520 --> 03:12.860]  But again, the coronavirus continues to spread, 17,000 confirmed cases now, 361 people dead.
[03:12.860 --> 03:18.200]  Of course, those are the official numbers being put out by the Chinese government.
[03:18.200 --> 03:23.520]  Many observers, credible observers have said that many of these cases are being diagnosed
[03:23.520 --> 03:29.440]  as pneumonia, they're not being officially recorded as coronavirus cases, and the real
[03:29.440 --> 03:31.720]  numbers are being hidden.
[03:31.720 --> 03:36.120]  But if you talk about that, if you talk about the real cause of the coronavirus, if you
[03:36.120 --> 03:41.840]  speculate in any way, even while citing some of these same experts, you may get banned
[03:41.840 --> 03:49.160]  entirely off of social media over the weekend, zero hedge, which is one of the biggest, you
[03:49.160 --> 03:54.720]  could call it alternative media websites, but it's mainly a financial website, banned
[03:54.720 --> 03:56.640]  by Twitter.
[03:56.640 --> 04:02.720]  The circumstances behind the ban remain murky, Buzzfeed put out a hit piece, obviously once
[04:02.720 --> 04:08.280]  again abusing their position to lobby for their competition to be banned, claiming that zero
[04:08.280 --> 04:14.720]  hedge was banned by Twitter for doxing a, I think it was a virologist, who they accused
[04:14.720 --> 04:20.800]  of potentially being the source of the coronavirus, turns out that that information was publicly
[04:20.800 --> 04:27.040]  available all along, it was not a doxing, but then the alternative explanation, and
[04:27.040 --> 04:31.960]  this was the one that Twitter put out, or at least Reuters is reporting they did, that
[04:31.960 --> 04:40.480]  zero hedge was banned for platform manipulation policy, which means putting out, quote, disinformation.
[04:40.480 --> 04:42.280]  What is disinformation?
[04:42.280 --> 04:47.080]  Any information with which they, the establishment media do not agree.
[04:47.080 --> 04:52.360]  So we've reached a new level of censorship, where it's actually not harassment, not bullying,
[04:52.360 --> 04:57.360]  but facts that they don't like that can now get you banned on social media, don't go away,
[04:57.360 --> 04:58.360]  we'll be back.
[04:58.360 --> 05:06.120]  It is I, the leader of Cobra here for a message to President Trump, the American people, and
[05:06.120 --> 05:09.240]  Alex Jones of InfoWords.
[05:09.240 --> 05:15.320]  Our operation for our partners, the Communist Chinese, have bought control of your media,
[05:15.320 --> 05:23.440]  but it's true, your people are beginning to awaken, that's why Cobra is launching operations
[05:23.440 --> 05:31.760]  to trigger race war, mass shootings and bombings, which will be blamed on those loyal to America.
[05:31.760 --> 05:37.760]  Anyone once we stage these attacks, that does not blame it on Trump, will also be tied in
[05:37.760 --> 05:41.960]  by Cobra in the future.
[05:41.960 --> 05:48.880]  You see, when you expose our false flags and fake media, I will carry out attacks and
[05:48.880 --> 05:55.880]  then blame you, like we've done with Alex Jones, blaming him for mass shootings we committed.
[05:55.880 --> 06:01.360]  Hey, ol' Cobra!
[06:01.360 --> 06:11.160]  You're listening to the Summit.News Radio Hour with Paul Joseph Watson.
[06:11.160 --> 06:16.640]  So we had yet another Islamic terrorist attack on the streets of London yesterday in broad
[06:16.640 --> 06:17.640]  daylight.
[06:17.640 --> 06:20.480]  Thankfully, nobody died, at least not yet.
[06:20.480 --> 06:25.080]  Two people stabbed, another person injured as a result of the terrorist being shot and
[06:25.080 --> 06:27.120]  some glass shattering.
[06:27.120 --> 06:29.640]  The attacker has been named as Sudesh Aman.
[06:29.640 --> 06:32.120]  This is a headline out of BBC News.
[06:32.120 --> 06:37.840]  Sudesh Aman, who was the Stratham attacker, Stratham being the location in South London
[06:37.840 --> 06:43.560]  where this attack took place, says Sudesh Aman, the 20-year-old responsible for the
[06:43.560 --> 06:49.000]  attack in Stratham, South London on Sunday, pleaded guilty in November 2018 to six charges
[06:49.000 --> 06:54.440]  of possessing documents containing terrorist information and seven of disseminating terrorist
[06:54.440 --> 06:55.440]  publications.
[06:55.440 --> 07:03.200]  Remember that date, November 2018, yet he was out free on the streets a few days ago
[07:03.200 --> 07:08.400]  unable to carry out this attack, despite planning to carry out an attack before he was even
[07:08.400 --> 07:09.400]  in prison.
[07:09.400 --> 07:14.720]  There's three of the terrorist manuals a man admitted owning were about knife fighting.
[07:14.720 --> 07:18.760]  Of course, that was the weapon he used to attempt to kill the innocent people on the
[07:18.760 --> 07:19.760]  streets.
[07:19.760 --> 07:20.760]  It's a Stratham.
[07:20.760 --> 07:24.240]  In fact, much of Aman's fascination with conducting an attack was said to be focused
[07:24.240 --> 07:26.400]  on using a knife.
[07:26.400 --> 07:30.720]  He was jailed at the Old Bailey the following month for three years and four months and
[07:30.720 --> 07:34.320]  he was smiling while he was sentenced.
[07:34.320 --> 07:39.080]  He was released from HMP Belmarsh, which we're going to get onto talking about here in a
[07:39.080 --> 07:45.760]  second on 23rd of January after serving just half of his sentence in custody.
[07:45.760 --> 07:50.240]  So we're talking less than two weeks later, he has the time to plan the attack.
[07:50.240 --> 07:53.040]  He's out on the streets carrying out the attack.
[07:53.040 --> 07:58.520]  He was under a curfew and had to wear a GPS tag coupled with exclusion zones such as ports
[07:58.520 --> 07:59.520]  and airports.
[07:59.520 --> 08:01.960]  He had to surrender his passport.
[08:01.960 --> 08:08.760]  So presumably because he had this GPS tag, that's why the anti-terror police were following
[08:08.760 --> 08:12.320]  him around in the hours before this attack.
[08:12.320 --> 08:16.840]  That's presumably what happened given how swift they were in arriving on the scene.
[08:16.840 --> 08:21.240]  I think it was almost within minutes to shoot him dead.
[08:21.240 --> 08:25.880]  Now getting into some of these posts that Aman put up on social media before he was
[08:25.880 --> 08:30.960]  jailed and then released early, the posts included a photo showing an image of a knife
[08:30.960 --> 08:36.440]  along with two firearms and a shahada flag along with the Arabic words armed and ready
[08:36.440 --> 08:37.440]  April 3rd.
[08:37.440 --> 08:42.080]  So he was planning some kind of attack back in 2018.
[08:42.080 --> 08:47.400]  He also featured a video of a pro gay rights speaker who frequented speakers corner in
[08:47.400 --> 08:53.080]  Hyde Park in London and called on others to quote, unite together to attack one another.
[08:53.080 --> 08:55.720]  He will be there this Sunday at Hyde Park.
[08:55.720 --> 09:01.320]  There was directly inciting violence against an individual calling on people to violently
[09:01.320 --> 09:04.800]  attack someone for their free speech.
[09:04.800 --> 09:09.280]  He's also discovered that the student was using a WhatsApp group exposing young members
[09:09.280 --> 09:11.400]  of his family to violent terrorist material.
[09:11.400 --> 09:18.240]  So he was already trying to radicalize members of his own family before he even went to prison,
[09:18.240 --> 09:23.600]  HMP Belmarsh, which is notorious for radicalizing Islamic terrorists.
[09:23.600 --> 09:30.000]  But then earlier today, his mother came out and said, oh, he was just a lovely nice polite
[09:30.000 --> 09:33.760]  boy and he was only radicalized because he was sent to that prison.
[09:33.760 --> 09:38.280]  Well, now he was already trying to radicalize members of his own family before he even went
[09:38.280 --> 09:40.120]  to prison.
[09:40.120 --> 09:45.560]  Article continues, he used social media and WhatsApp to share an Al Qaeda magazine and
[09:45.560 --> 09:50.320]  exclaimed the Islamic State is here to stay in his own words.
[09:50.320 --> 09:55.440]  The WhatsApp group entitled La Familia included images of Anand's younger siblings in poses
[09:55.440 --> 09:59.320]  reminiscent of IS supporters.
[09:59.320 --> 10:03.040]  And then I wrote an article about this, which gets into more detail, Stratham terrorists
[10:03.040 --> 10:06.880]  released early despite pledging allegiance to ISIS.
[10:06.880 --> 10:11.840]  That's what we do around here, meanwhile, you know, women with their babies in their arms
[10:11.840 --> 10:17.760]  are being arrested in their own kitchens for posting anti-transgender stuff on Facebook.
[10:17.760 --> 10:22.400]  Article reads, 20 year old Islamic terrorist Sudesh Amant, who was shot dead after trying
[10:22.400 --> 10:26.680]  to stab people in Stratham, South London, was released halfway through his prison sentence
[10:26.680 --> 10:28.800]  despite pledging allegiance to ISIS.
[10:28.800 --> 10:33.800]  And here's the list, and this is by no means an exhaustive list of terror offenses that
[10:33.800 --> 10:41.040]  he was initially jailed for in November, 2018, pledging allegiance to ISIS, plotting to
[10:41.040 --> 10:45.800]  carry out a terror attack using a knife, which is what you went on to do, sharing terror
[10:45.800 --> 10:51.680]  manuals, including one on how to make a homemade bomb, encouraging his girlfriend to behead
[10:51.680 --> 10:58.200]  her kafar, which means in Islamic parlance, non-believer parents that was asking his own
[10:58.200 --> 11:05.840]  girlfriend to behead her parents because they're not Muslims, stockpiling arms, inciting violence
[11:05.840 --> 11:10.600]  against Yazidis, because they're the Christians, and asserting the Koran permits of them to
[11:10.600 --> 11:16.440]  be raped, and encouraging an attack against the pro-right speaker in pro-gay right speaker
[11:16.440 --> 11:19.440]  in Hyde Park, as I just mentioned.
[11:19.440 --> 11:24.040]  So for all that, and that's by no means an exhaustive list, he was given three years
[11:24.040 --> 11:29.840]  and four months in prison and was let out halfway through.
[11:29.840 --> 11:36.080]  Now what happened back in November, 2019, you probably remember this one, Uzman Khan,
[11:36.080 --> 11:40.880]  the perpetrator of the November 29 London Bridge stabbings, of course, several people
[11:40.880 --> 11:42.880]  died during that attack.
[11:42.880 --> 11:49.600]  We had the ridiculous Benny Hill-style situation of brave to be fair to them courageous citizens
[11:49.600 --> 11:54.920]  chasing this guy around with narwhal tusks and fire extinguishers trying to take him
[11:54.920 --> 11:55.920]  on.
[11:55.920 --> 11:59.080]  But unfortunately, several people did die during that attack.
[11:59.080 --> 12:02.360]  But again, it had this very same MO.
[12:02.360 --> 12:07.680]  This guy, Uzman Khan, the previous Islamic terrorist on the loose in London, had been
[12:07.680 --> 12:13.480]  released early from his prison sentence, the terrorist offences, including a plot to kill
[12:13.480 --> 12:18.760]  Boris Johnson, then the mayor, now prime minister, of course, and bombed the London
[12:18.760 --> 12:20.680]  Stock Exchange.
[12:20.680 --> 12:26.440]  Despite being banned from entering London, Khan was given a day release to do what?
[12:26.440 --> 12:31.920]  To attend a course to help offenders reintegrate into society.
[12:31.920 --> 12:37.040]  And of course, as you probably remember, in a horrible twist of irony, one of Khan's
[12:37.040 --> 12:43.080]  victims, Jack Merritt, was a coordinator for that very reintegration program.
[12:43.080 --> 12:44.480]  It was called Learning Together.
[12:44.480 --> 12:50.200]  And his father reacted to his son's death by asserting that his son would, quote, not
[12:50.200 --> 12:55.640]  wish his death to be used as the pretext for more draconian sentences or for detaining
[12:55.640 --> 12:57.800]  people unnecessarily.
[12:57.800 --> 13:01.200]  So again, his father was a big leftist, as was his son.
[13:01.200 --> 13:07.040]  And he came out after the death of his son and said, don't use the death of my son to
[13:07.040 --> 13:12.200]  basically change the law so that we can keep these terrorists in prison longer.
[13:12.200 --> 13:16.920]  And yet what happened yesterday, one of these terrorists who should have been imprisoned
[13:16.920 --> 13:24.800]  for longer, was let out early and once again went on to attempt to commit jihad.
[13:24.800 --> 13:27.840]  The same MO over and over again.
[13:27.840 --> 13:34.040]  Why are we letting terrorists who pledge allegiance to ISIS plan jihadist terror attacks out of
[13:34.040 --> 13:36.440]  jail after 18 months?
[13:36.440 --> 13:39.120]  It wasn't even 18 months in the latest case.
[13:39.120 --> 13:45.360]  A man, it was about 14 months, he was telling his girlfriend to behead her own parents.
[13:45.360 --> 13:48.120]  He was building stockpiles of weapons.
[13:48.120 --> 13:52.160]  He was calling for violent attacks on gay rights people.
[13:52.160 --> 13:53.720]  You think the left would care about that?
[13:53.720 --> 13:57.600]  No, they want these people released early.
[13:57.600 --> 13:59.360]  He was telling people how to make homemade bombs.
[13:59.360 --> 14:02.520]  He was trying to radicalize members of his own family.
[14:02.520 --> 14:07.880]  He was let out early after just 13 months.
[14:07.880 --> 14:12.760]  People continue, some reacted to yesterday's attack by pointing out that a man had left
[14:12.760 --> 14:17.680]  jail even more radicalized than when he went in, proving that prisons with large Muslim
[14:17.680 --> 14:20.520]  populations are recruiting grounds for terrorists.
[14:20.520 --> 14:24.320]  And this is the key point.
[14:24.320 --> 14:31.320]  Just like Usman Khan, the London Bridge attacker, a man was being held at HMP Belmarsh Prison,
[14:31.320 --> 14:36.880]  a maximum security facility described by one former inmate as being, quote, like a jihadi
[14:36.880 --> 14:37.880]  training camp.
[14:37.880 --> 14:42.160]  Usman Khan was also in prison at Belmarsh.
[14:42.160 --> 14:44.120]  These terrorists, they're already terrorists.
[14:44.120 --> 14:45.280]  They go to Belmarsh.
[14:45.280 --> 14:47.480]  They come out even more radicalized.
[14:47.480 --> 14:49.960]  Why are they being released?
[14:49.960 --> 14:53.720]  They should be locked up for life.
[14:53.720 --> 14:57.800]  According to the former inmate, Belmarsh is occupied by a group of Islamists called the
[14:57.800 --> 15:04.000]  Brothers, otherwise known as the Aki, who, quote, almost have the run of the prison.
[15:04.000 --> 15:08.560]  So they're sending terrorists into prisons that are run by other terrorists and then
[15:08.560 --> 15:12.160]  letting them out again.
[15:12.160 --> 15:15.080]  The inmate said the problem is that Belmarsh is also a holding prison.
[15:15.080 --> 15:18.360]  And so young people who are brainwashed and indoctrinated, then go out into the wider
[15:18.360 --> 15:23.360]  prison system and create wider Aki networks.
[15:23.360 --> 15:29.480]  So far from being reformed, far from being punished, they're actually creating more terrorists
[15:29.480 --> 15:31.800]  by sending them into these kind of prisons.
[15:31.800 --> 15:34.320]  And this one's not even the worst from what I read.
[15:34.320 --> 15:40.720]  We're going to get into the prison situation in the United Kingdom and why it's a factory.
[15:40.720 --> 15:44.640]  It's a rollout factory for these jihadists that are slaughtering people on the streets
[15:44.640 --> 15:48.160]  of London on now what seems like a monthly basis.
[15:48.160 --> 15:54.560]  The trend is London wide and yet mass immigration from Muslim countries into the United Kingdom
[15:54.560 --> 15:56.240]  continues unabated.
[15:56.240 --> 15:57.240]  Don't go away.
[15:57.240 --> 15:58.240]  We'll be right back.
[15:58.240 --> 16:01.520]  I'm here with Scott Yousiam, founder of OMGTax.
[16:01.520 --> 16:06.280]  Tell us how your company helps our listeners out there who have a problem with the IRS.
[16:06.280 --> 16:11.600]  My team of lawyers enrolled agents and licensed tax experts removed wage garnish fans.
[16:11.600 --> 16:15.520]  Sometimes in the same day, we even have reduced the total debt some of our clients were required
[16:15.520 --> 16:18.200]  to pay through what is known as an offer in compromise.
[16:18.200 --> 16:20.520]  Can you give us an example of somebody you help?
[16:20.520 --> 16:22.080]  Oh, can I ever?
[16:22.080 --> 16:27.320]  We have taken a $500,000 liability with the IRS.
[16:27.320 --> 16:28.320]  Guess what?
[16:28.320 --> 16:32.280]  Your client didn't pay a dime through the representation known as non-collectible status
[16:32.280 --> 16:33.280]  with the government.
[16:33.280 --> 16:38.120]  If you owe the IRS more than $10,000 and you want to see if it's possible to pay a lot
[16:38.120 --> 16:43.640]  less, call OMGTax right now for a free tax-saving consultation.
[16:43.640 --> 16:58.000]  Call 800-486-8112-800-486-8112, 800-486-8112, that's 800-486-8112.
[16:58.000 --> 17:00.280]  Welcome GCN self-reliance listeners.
[17:00.280 --> 17:04.160]  If you've ever wanted an emergency solar survival backup system that we're waiting
[17:04.160 --> 17:08.480]  for prices too crazy to pass up, this will be the most important message you'll ever
[17:08.480 --> 17:09.480]  hear.
[17:09.480 --> 17:12.560]  Bill Hyde here and I want to tell you about a huge sale with historically low prices
[17:12.560 --> 17:17.280]  on our PPX microgrid system that's going to let you produce an endless supply of electricity
[17:17.280 --> 17:18.280]  off the grid.
[17:18.280 --> 17:22.160]  The clearance price is a result of the historic flooding we're having here right on the east
[17:22.160 --> 17:23.680]  bank of the Mississippi.
[17:23.680 --> 17:27.480]  Because of the flooding, we've had to move a lot of our inventory to a temporary location
[17:27.480 --> 17:31.240]  and rather than move it back to the warehouse, we thought we'd offer the system at a price
[17:31.240 --> 17:35.600]  that might seem unbelievable if you didn't know the floodwater's backstory.
[17:35.600 --> 17:41.240]  So here's what you should do right now, check out the PPX microgrid system at myownpowergrid.com.
[17:41.240 --> 17:47.200]  That's myownpowergrid.com, over $1,000 in great off the grid gear and a ton of bonuses
[17:47.200 --> 17:48.200]  too.
[17:48.200 --> 17:49.200]  And the best part?
[17:49.200 --> 17:51.840]  You're not going to pay $750 or $500 or even $200.
[17:51.840 --> 17:54.600]  Go to myownpowergrid.com to learn more.
[17:54.600 --> 17:58.800]  That's myownpowergrid.com.
[17:58.800 --> 18:05.400]  Infowarslife.com, infowarslife.com, infowarslife.com.
[18:05.400 --> 18:11.640]  You go to that URL, it takes you to the subsection of infowarsstore.com where you find the 60 plus
[18:11.640 --> 18:16.080]  products where we've gone out and researched what is the best, what gives people the best
[18:16.080 --> 18:20.800]  results, we either private label it or we develop our own with top developers.
[18:20.800 --> 18:25.600]  And folks, I'm telling you, you can see the difference in me, my energy, my focus.
[18:25.600 --> 18:28.600]  I've lost almost 40 pounds in less than four months.
[18:28.600 --> 18:29.600]  It's incredible.
[18:29.600 --> 18:31.240]  So do yourself a favor.
[18:31.240 --> 18:33.640]  Try out the products if you've been on the fence.
[18:33.640 --> 18:37.720]  You can't lose except if you don't take action because when you buy the products, you're
[18:37.720 --> 18:42.920]  funding the operation that is always delivering thanks to your support and God's grace in
[18:42.920 --> 18:43.920]  our action.
[18:43.920 --> 18:45.480]  But you need these products.
[18:45.480 --> 18:48.440]  That's the real reason you want to get them is because they're amazing.
[18:48.440 --> 18:52.560]  And then when you get great results, please tell others about it word of mouth.
[18:52.560 --> 18:56.240]  That's how we expand in the face of the NWO instead of imploding.
[18:56.240 --> 18:58.080]  We're fighting to win and we are winning.
[18:58.080 --> 18:59.080]  Thanks to you.
[18:59.080 --> 19:03.920]  There's a lot of phony garbage out there in the world, a lot of people that never deliver.
[19:03.920 --> 19:12.000]  Well, I'm here to tell you infowars has delivered in royal flush in a handful of ace of spades
[19:12.000 --> 19:16.760]  because of God, because of the audience of activists and because of the great team at
[19:16.760 --> 19:21.120]  infowars and we are all a team, ladies and gentlemen.
[19:21.120 --> 19:22.880]  So right now, humanity's awakening.
[19:22.880 --> 19:23.880]  It's explosive.
[19:23.880 --> 19:24.880]  It's powerful.
[19:24.880 --> 19:25.880]  It's incredible.
[19:25.880 --> 19:28.280]  But there's major obstacles coming down the road.
[19:28.280 --> 19:33.080]  And the only way we can effectively fight the NWO and stay in the game on infowars is
[19:33.080 --> 19:34.080]  to tip the spear.
[19:34.080 --> 19:38.800]  As your financial support, we make it really easy at infowarsstore.com, but I am blowing
[19:38.800 --> 19:44.200]  through our backup money right now with our reporters doing triple the work they ever
[19:44.200 --> 19:49.040]  have because they volunteered to do it and Owen and the rest of crew will fight 18 hours
[19:49.040 --> 19:53.120]  a day, seven days a week during this election year that's so critical, but they need the
[19:53.120 --> 19:55.400]  financing to put them in the field.
[19:55.400 --> 20:01.560]  Go to infowarsstore.com and fight for your own future.
[20:01.560 --> 20:17.760]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[20:17.760 --> 20:23.640]  Leading a frontal assault on the lives of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[20:23.640 --> 20:31.440]  So, of course, the usual suspects on Twitter yesterday as this attack was unfolding in
[20:31.440 --> 20:37.280]  the aftermath, immediate aftermath of this Islamic terror attack in London were on Twitter
[20:37.280 --> 20:42.240]  expressing the real concern, which was not the fact that we'd just had the second Islamic
[20:42.240 --> 20:48.120]  terror attack stabbing attack on the streets of London within the space of two months.
[20:48.120 --> 20:49.120]  What was it now?
[20:49.120 --> 20:51.160]  The sixth or seventh in the past few years?
[20:51.160 --> 20:53.800]  Of course, we had the Manchester arena bombing.
[20:53.800 --> 20:56.200]  We had the attack on Westminster Bridge.
[20:56.200 --> 21:00.800]  We had the other attack on London Bridge where the terrorists mowed down a bunch of people
[21:00.800 --> 21:07.080]  then got out and started cutting the throats of people in nearby bars and restaurants.
[21:07.080 --> 21:08.080]  No.
[21:08.080 --> 21:10.480]  The main concern is not why this keeps happening.
[21:10.480 --> 21:17.000]  The main concern is people having their feelings hurt on the internet in the immediate aftermath
[21:17.000 --> 21:19.680]  calls to stop the Islamophobia.
[21:19.680 --> 21:23.720]  That was the main concern with many of the blue checkmarks on Twitter as it usually is.
[21:23.720 --> 21:28.200]  Of course, if a white supremacist far right terrorist does anything similar, then of course
[21:28.200 --> 21:30.680]  all white people are immediately to blame.
[21:30.680 --> 21:35.280]  But if we look at the circumstances again to recap, the exact same situation happened
[21:35.280 --> 21:40.640]  with Usman Khan, the London Bridge terrorist, released early halfway through what was already
[21:40.640 --> 21:45.160]  a minimal sentence for terror offences.
[21:45.160 --> 21:50.920]  Starting with this guy, Sudesh Amman, in London yesterday, pledged allegiance to ISIS, plans
[21:50.920 --> 21:55.600]  to carry out a terror attack, the stoppiling arms, encouraging attacks against pro-gay
[21:55.600 --> 21:56.600]  rights people.
[21:56.600 --> 21:58.920]  Leftists don't seem to care about that.
[21:58.920 --> 22:03.960]  Encourages his girlfriend to behead her parents because they weren't Muslims, with sharing
[22:03.960 --> 22:06.880]  materials on how to make homemade bombs.
[22:06.880 --> 22:13.720]  He was released halfway through his sentence after 13 months in prison.
[22:13.720 --> 22:18.440]  We'll get more than 13 months in prison for far lesser offences, many of them related
[22:18.440 --> 22:21.880]  to hate speech, by the way.
[22:21.880 --> 22:27.120]  We focus in on Belmarsh prison because it's the same prison that Usman Khan was sent to
[22:27.120 --> 22:29.720]  and released from early.
[22:29.720 --> 22:33.360]  Former inmates talking about this network of Islamists who basically have the run of
[22:33.360 --> 22:39.120]  the prison, they radicalized people who weren't radicals going in and they also re-radicalized
[22:39.120 --> 22:43.800]  the ones who were already planning terrorist attacks, as in the case of this individual
[22:43.800 --> 22:46.920]  from yesterday's attack.
[22:46.920 --> 22:51.480]  Article continues, this has strengthened terrorists released early, despite pledging allegiance
[22:51.480 --> 22:58.560]  to ISIS, up on Summit.News, over the past five years, the Muslim percentage of the prison
[22:58.560 --> 23:04.280]  population, this is Belmarsh, has doubled to 30%.
[23:04.280 --> 23:09.040]  Now when we talk about these, quote, hate facts, we tread on very sensitive ground.
[23:09.040 --> 23:15.400]  So this is the London Evening Standard reporting, quote, this trend is London-wide.
[23:15.400 --> 23:22.360]  HMP ISIS, yes, it's really called ISIS, that's a prison in Thames, Mead, and Felham Young
[23:22.360 --> 23:32.040]  offenders Institute, both in London, Muslims now comprise 42 and 34% of prisoners, respectively,
[23:32.040 --> 23:36.960]  despite Muslims amounting to just 12% of London's population.
[23:36.960 --> 23:41.200]  So in these prisons across London, many of which are breeding grounds for terrorists,
[23:41.200 --> 23:46.680]  Muslims are overrepresented in the prison population by double or three times.
[23:46.680 --> 23:51.040]  I think that's a stat that we need to focus on, isn't it?
[23:51.040 --> 23:56.320]  Meanwhile, mass immigration from Muslim countries into the UK will continue in substantial numbers
[23:56.320 --> 24:03.720]  with the Muslim population, according to demographic projections, set to triple within 30 years.
[24:03.720 --> 24:05.560]  So good luck with that.
[24:05.560 --> 24:08.920]  And we have a similar situation in Sweden.
[24:08.920 --> 24:10.840]  This is out of Breitbart.
[24:10.840 --> 24:17.120]  Islamic terrorists who plotted Danish newspaper massacre released in Sweden.
[24:17.120 --> 24:21.480]  Radical Islamic extremists who plotted to massacre the staff of Danish newspaper Yilan
[24:21.480 --> 24:27.080]  and Poston in 2010 has been released by Swedish authorities, despite plotting more attacks
[24:27.080 --> 24:29.720]  while in prison.
[24:29.720 --> 24:32.960]  So it's as if the Charlie Hebdo Jihadists had survived.
[24:32.960 --> 24:36.520]  They put them in prison and we're now releasing them in France.
[24:36.520 --> 24:41.880]  This is the level of insanity that we're subjected to in Europe at the moment.
[24:41.880 --> 24:45.680]  The man who's not been identified by name is said to be in his 40s and was one of three
[24:45.680 --> 24:51.440]  Swedish citizens arrested as co-conspirators in the 2010 plot, who were initially in prison
[24:51.440 --> 24:54.440]  in Denmark, but later moved to Sweden.
[24:54.440 --> 25:00.960]  Of course, Denmark closed its borders with Sweden partly because of rampant crime from
[25:00.960 --> 25:05.960]  no-go areas populated mainly by Islamist gangs.
[25:05.960 --> 25:10.080]  Article continues, during his time in prison, the Muslim radical is said to have plotted
[25:10.080 --> 25:14.560]  even more attacks with instructions on how to make a bomb and a map of Copenhagen's public
[25:14.560 --> 25:17.400]  transportation system being found in his cell.
[25:17.400 --> 25:22.760]  He said to behave poorly after being transferred to a Swedish prison and told prison officials
[25:22.760 --> 25:26.840]  he was ready to, quote, kill and murder during his stay.
[25:26.840 --> 25:30.640]  Sounds like the perfect candidate to be released, doesn't he?
[25:30.640 --> 25:33.960]  According to the Swedish prison probation service, the man later presented a much calmer
[25:33.960 --> 25:38.040]  temperament and no longer needed to be kept in a secure part of prison in which he was
[25:38.040 --> 25:39.720]  housed.
[25:39.720 --> 25:42.800]  Last year, after completing his sentence, the terror plotter was released a year old
[25:42.800 --> 25:48.600]  in a Swedish university in the spring of 2019 and changed his name, presumably disappeared
[25:48.600 --> 25:52.960]  into the general public, which is what a lot of them do.
[25:52.960 --> 25:54.760]  So he's been released.
[25:54.760 --> 26:00.000]  The guy yesterday who stabbed three people in Stratham was released early, despite literally
[26:00.000 --> 26:04.280]  telling his girlfriend to behead her parents and plotting terror attacks against gay people
[26:04.280 --> 26:06.920]  and others, pledging allegiance to ISIS.
[26:06.920 --> 26:11.480]  Usman Karn, the London Bridge terrorist, was also released early.
[26:11.480 --> 26:13.560]  What's the solution?
[26:13.560 --> 26:17.040]  Don't import huge numbers of people from Muslim countries.
[26:17.040 --> 26:18.600]  What's the other solution?
[26:18.600 --> 26:23.760]  If people are plotting terrorist attacks, in the case of Usman Karn, literally plotting
[26:23.760 --> 26:30.000]  to bomb the London Stock Exchange, why on earth are they getting out after 18 months,
[26:30.000 --> 26:33.760]  after 13 months in the case of this man guy from yesterday?
[26:33.760 --> 26:37.600]  I mean, Nigel Farage has made this point over and over again.
[26:37.600 --> 26:39.240]  Jihadism is a disease.
[26:39.240 --> 26:43.360]  You're not going to stamp it out by sending these people into prisons, which then re-radicalize
[26:43.360 --> 26:46.840]  them, make them even more radical.
[26:46.840 --> 26:49.640]  Don't allow them into the country in the first place.
[26:49.640 --> 26:53.600]  And if they're already in the country, keep them locked up.
[26:53.600 --> 26:57.280]  People are dying on an almost monthly basis now in London.
[26:57.280 --> 27:01.960]  On top of that, you've got the massive problem with knife crime as it is, which again has
[27:01.960 --> 27:04.240]  been exacerbated by mass migration.
[27:04.240 --> 27:08.400]  Again, the London Evening Standard did a report on that.
[27:08.400 --> 27:13.560]  They talked to officials from the government who said, yes, the crime gangs in London are
[27:13.560 --> 27:18.560]  having to one up their violence because they're having to compete with more violent gangs
[27:18.560 --> 27:24.600]  who are coming in predominantly from the Middle East, from African countries like the Congo.
[27:24.600 --> 27:28.920]  So they're having to up their level of violence simply to compete in these turf wars.
[27:28.920 --> 27:32.320]  I've done numerous videos about this.
[27:32.320 --> 27:37.560]  Somali migrant parents are now literally sending their children back to Somalia because they
[27:37.560 --> 27:40.800]  say it's safer than London.
[27:40.800 --> 27:46.680]  We've had weak police measures to the point where the previous prime minister, Theresa
[27:46.680 --> 27:51.080]  May, told the police that they couldn't chase violent criminals who were getting away on
[27:51.080 --> 27:57.680]  motorbikes if the criminals removed their helmets because that might be a threat to their safety.
[27:57.680 --> 28:04.240]  And we wonder why the UK is experiencing a drastic rise in knife crime in violent crime
[28:04.240 --> 28:05.920]  across the board.
[28:05.920 --> 28:10.320]  So it's gotten to the level of absolute absurdity.
[28:10.320 --> 28:14.640]  And the frustration is always the fact that nobody wants to talk about any solutions.
[28:14.640 --> 28:17.120]  Nobody wants to ask why this is happening again and again.
[28:17.120 --> 28:22.680]  The only thing people want to talk about on Twitter, the blue checkmarks, the virtue signalers
[28:22.680 --> 28:28.480]  is how we need to react to this by not being mean to people on the internet and then maybe
[28:28.480 --> 28:29.480]  it will stop.
[28:29.480 --> 28:30.480]  No, it's not going to stop.
[28:30.480 --> 28:31.480]  That hasn't worked.
[28:31.480 --> 28:33.000]  We need to do something different.
[28:33.000 --> 28:39.360]  I'm going to come back in the next segment and talk about the latest with the coronavirus.
[28:39.360 --> 28:43.160]  China is now accusing the US of causing panic and spreading fear.
[28:43.160 --> 28:46.840]  Of course, we've had many experts who are saying that China is not releasing the full
[28:46.840 --> 28:51.800]  numbers, not telling the true story about what's happening with the coronavirus spread.
[28:51.800 --> 28:57.640]  And now publications who question the Communist Party of China are being banned on social
[28:57.640 --> 28:58.640]  media.
[28:58.640 --> 29:03.320]  A lot of these is on the rise, clogged arteries, high blood pressure and high cholesterol levels
[29:03.320 --> 29:07.160]  may not be fully detected by you, but the symptoms are there.
[29:07.160 --> 29:12.000]  Loss of energy, blood sugar, spikes and drops, poor circulation and irregular heartbeat are
[29:12.000 --> 29:15.360]  just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[29:15.360 --> 29:20.040]  Here, how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives
[29:20.040 --> 29:21.240]  across America.
[29:21.240 --> 29:25.040]  My blood pressure has normalized, my diabetes has totally improved.
[29:25.040 --> 29:28.960]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look and I'm telling everyone how much healthier
[29:28.960 --> 29:29.960]  I feel.
[29:29.960 --> 29:32.280]  I recommend heart and body extract to everyone.

[30:22.000 --> 30:23.160]  how important it is.
[30:23.160 --> 30:27.040]  The UN admits two billion people have low IQ or mental disability because they never

[30:40.140 --> 30:42.120]  You don't have sun during the winter.
[30:42.120 --> 30:44.720]  Sun helps your body produce the vitamin D3.
[30:44.720 --> 30:45.920]  That's why people get so sick.
[30:45.920 --> 30:46.920]  That's the main reason.

[31:03.680 --> 31:05.800]  I'm not here giving you a sales pitch.
[31:05.800 --> 31:08.520]  I'm pointing out the way forward.
[31:08.520 --> 31:14.000]  Things that I've discovered that I absolutely know work that if you listen to me and try

[31:20.160 --> 31:25.080]  we're selling will help you and will help us and it's symbiotic.
[31:25.080 --> 31:30.520]  My friends, I harp and harp and harp about iodine because it's the good halogen, fluoride's
[31:30.520 --> 31:32.320]  the bad halogen.
[31:32.320 --> 31:36.800]  People told me about it for years and I didn't listen and I'm so thankful that finally I
[31:36.800 --> 31:43.960]  listened to Dr. Grip like eight years ago and started taking true iodine, atomic iodine.
[31:43.960 --> 31:50.840]  We've got it back in StockX2, 40% off right now at m4store.com and I'm telling you folks,
[31:50.840 --> 31:56.400]  get it, it's amazing, discover the benefits and it funds the M4, a 360 win.
[31:56.400 --> 31:58.240]  You can't lose unless you don't take action.
[31:58.240 --> 32:01.520]  Well, it's here, the year 2020.
[32:01.520 --> 32:02.880]  World government's out in the open.
[32:02.880 --> 32:06.560]  We've got the predicted mass pandemics and they're calling for global government as
[32:06.560 --> 32:12.360]  the answer and we've got massive, huge censorship taking place that's coordinated by big tech
[32:12.360 --> 32:19.000]  and banks against people that promote America and guns and freedom and Jesus and the family
[32:19.000 --> 32:21.200]  and the protection of the unborn.
[32:21.200 --> 32:22.200]  Wow.
[32:22.200 --> 32:23.200]  Yes, now we know we're right.
[32:23.200 --> 32:27.720]  The new world order's real, Satanism's real, the pedophile, a leader real, but we're real
[32:27.720 --> 32:31.640]  as well and we love God and we're standing up and saying no, but I just want to make
[32:31.640 --> 32:35.680]  the point here one month into 2020 that we have never been in Kansas.
[32:35.680 --> 32:39.680]  We have never been in some smallville place that didn't matter.
[32:39.680 --> 32:44.720]  Everything we do, every decision we make governs the future of our species and everything we've
[32:44.720 --> 32:46.240]  gone through and everything we're going to go through.
[32:46.240 --> 32:49.560]  So it's an incredible time to be alive and I want to thank you all for being aware and
[32:49.560 --> 32:50.560]  being involved.
[32:50.560 --> 32:56.440]  But just remember, your action now via prayer, word of mouth and financial support of m4store.com
[32:56.440 --> 33:24.840]  is critical, so please take action.
[33:26.440 --> 33:34.480]  Alex Jones here reporting from the road on the incredibly dangerous developments concerning
[33:34.480 --> 33:35.480]  the coronavirus.
[33:35.480 --> 33:39.360]  It has now infected hundreds and hundreds of thousands of people.
[33:39.360 --> 33:45.000]  It has now spread across the entire planet and of course we've now discovered that indeed
[33:45.000 --> 33:46.920]  it is man-made and engineered.
[33:46.920 --> 33:52.280]  We're covering it live all of our team and m4store.com for its last show and band.video.
[33:52.280 --> 33:58.640]  On top of that, we have the patented nano silver that Congress A&M and Homeland Security
[33:58.640 --> 34:03.880]  have certified is able to take out the corona family virus as the SARS.
[34:03.880 --> 34:05.160]  That's what it comes out of.
[34:05.160 --> 34:09.760]  We have that at 40% off, despite the fact it's selling out in three different sizes
[34:09.760 --> 34:17.040]  at m4store.com and that's what I'm using, what my family is using as a frontline defense.
[34:17.040 --> 34:21.360]  Nothing's perfect except prayer and God's intervention and we hope that this thing isn't
[34:21.360 --> 34:25.800]  as bad as it looks, but definitely we know why governments are panicking right now because
[34:25.800 --> 34:28.720]  this is certainly a bizarre virus.
[34:28.720 --> 34:31.160]  The demand for food has not let up.
[34:31.160 --> 34:33.840]  We are selling record amounts of it.
[34:33.840 --> 34:38.280]  Everybody else is basically already sold out or they have giant wait list.
[34:38.280 --> 34:43.400]  Our suppliers have it in-house, mistaken seven to 10 days to deliver because again they have
[34:43.400 --> 34:44.400]  to package it.
[34:44.400 --> 34:48.680]  They're running 24 hours a day, but in a few days they're telling me it may go to a
[34:48.680 --> 34:51.080]  longer wait if you haven't gotten your order in.
[34:51.080 --> 34:52.080]  So I wouldn't crash tonight.
[34:52.080 --> 34:54.240]  We wanted this virus to be peering out.
[34:54.240 --> 34:55.840]  We wanted it to just be hype.
[34:55.840 --> 35:00.680]  Looks like it is really, really bad and is man-made and so that's why we're seeing the
[35:00.680 --> 35:01.680]  huge freak out.
[35:01.680 --> 35:05.880]  So get your storable food at m4store.com that helps fund our operation.
[35:05.880 --> 35:06.880]  It's insurance.
[35:06.880 --> 35:08.520]  You can eat a total 360 win.
[35:08.520 --> 35:13.360]  Again, get your food and actually get it delivered at m4store.com.
[35:13.360 --> 35:14.360]  Get your order in.
[35:14.360 --> 35:15.360]  It's locked in.
[35:15.360 --> 35:16.360]  Guaranteed seven to 10 days.
[35:16.360 --> 35:20.560]  m4store.com and regardless it funds the operation.
[35:20.560 --> 35:22.760]  We also have the immune gargle at 40% off.
[35:22.760 --> 35:29.760]  We are going to sell out of that, but I'm just keeping it at that sales price in m4store.com.
[35:29.760 --> 35:34.680]  You're listening to Summit.News with Paul Joseph Watson.
[35:34.680 --> 35:41.480]  I heard Alex are getting into the latest on the coronavirus, latest stats.
[35:41.480 --> 35:46.880]  Again, these numbers likely to be substantially below the true scale of this according to
[35:46.880 --> 35:54.320]  many experts, 17,000 confirmed cases, 361 people dead, BBC headline coronavirus China
[35:54.320 --> 35:57.600]  accuses the US of causing panic and spreading fear.
[35:57.600 --> 36:01.120]  The Chinese government has accused the US of causing panic in its response to the deadly
[36:01.120 --> 36:08.400]  coronavirus outbreak, even though the US response was by no means as severe as immediate
[36:08.400 --> 36:13.400]  as countries like Mongolia, which closed its border with China as countries like Russia,
[36:13.400 --> 36:18.240]  which closed its border with China, and countries like Israel, which shut down all flights from
[36:18.240 --> 36:24.280]  China way before the United States did anything and in fact hasn't done that much in comparison
[36:24.280 --> 36:25.760]  to many other nations.
[36:25.760 --> 36:32.280]  We have an article out of Nature, a study says a pneumonia outbreak associated with
[36:32.280 --> 36:35.720]  the new coronavirus is probable bat origin.
[36:35.720 --> 36:43.120]  Oh, but the media told me that linking coronavirus to bats was a racist conspiracy theory.
[36:43.120 --> 36:48.120]  Probably over the past 10 days, there have probably been about two dozen articles blaming
[36:48.120 --> 36:52.800]  people including yours truly for spreading the racist conspiracy theory that coronavirus
[36:52.800 --> 36:54.600]  was linked to bats.
[36:54.600 --> 36:59.520]  Despite the fact that the Ebola outbreak in Africa was linked to bats, where they eat
[36:59.520 --> 37:05.240]  bats, despite the fact that the SARS outbreak in Asia was linked to bats.
[37:05.240 --> 37:10.200]  So now actual peer reviewed scientific studies are coming out in China being published by
[37:10.200 --> 37:17.200]  nature.com saying that it does have a bat origin that hasn't been confirmed completely
[37:17.200 --> 37:21.560]  yet, but that's not the first scientific study to make that connection.
[37:21.560 --> 37:26.520]  So now it's not a racist conspiracy theory to talk about bats and indeed the consumption
[37:26.520 --> 37:31.720]  of bats in many areas of China, possibly being linked to coronavirus and not just bats of
[37:31.720 --> 37:39.080]  course, in the Wuhan animal market, they sold all kinds of grizzly things, including snakes.
[37:39.080 --> 37:41.280]  I went to China literally about four times.
[37:41.280 --> 37:44.760]  They serve snake in the best restaurants in China.
[37:44.760 --> 37:49.700]  It's not just in these back street illegal meat markets, where of course they use sewer
[37:49.700 --> 37:54.600]  waste as cooking oil, I'm sure that's very healthy and nutritious, not going to cause
[37:54.600 --> 37:56.760]  any infections whatsoever.
[37:56.760 --> 38:00.440]  But they actually sell bats, snakes, sorry, and all this other stuff, even in some of
[38:00.440 --> 38:03.760]  the best restaurants in Shanghai and Beijing.
[38:03.760 --> 38:04.760]  I've been there.
[38:04.760 --> 38:09.720]  I'm trying to say I've eaten it, didn't actually know it was snake when I was eating it, was
[38:09.720 --> 38:13.480]  subsequently told that I just eaten snake, yummy.
[38:13.480 --> 38:19.920]  So the media is very concerned not about the potential for a global coronavirus pandemic,
[38:19.920 --> 38:23.440]  but about people's feelings being hurt on the internet.
[38:23.440 --> 38:28.880]  Something they're also not really concerned about is this headline up on Summit News.
[38:28.880 --> 38:36.360]  Muslim cleric uses fatwa calling for coronavirus, quote, annihilation of Chinese people.
[38:36.360 --> 38:41.720]  While the media continues to fret about racist bat soup memes, the Muslim cleric just issued
[38:41.720 --> 38:45.680]  a fatwa celebrating the coronavirus outbreak and calling for the, quote, annihilation of
[38:45.680 --> 38:47.080]  Chinese people.
[38:47.080 --> 38:52.920]  This is Syrian jihadi cleric, Ab al-Razzak al-Madi, celebrating the spread of coronavirus
[38:52.920 --> 38:57.960]  in China and urging Muslims to pray for Allah to, quote, annihilate the people of China.
[38:57.960 --> 39:02.240]  This is being put out by memory says al-Madi is a prominent cleric.
[39:02.240 --> 39:07.640]  He's well respected by jihadi factions, known for his sermons and fatwas, which he put out
[39:07.640 --> 39:09.960]  by the way on Telegram.
[39:09.960 --> 39:17.240]  But according to memory, al-Madi, this jihadist preacher also has a Twitter account.
[39:17.240 --> 39:19.000]  Well, what do you know?
[39:19.000 --> 39:22.440]  I actually tried to look for his Twitter account, couldn't find it.
[39:22.440 --> 39:27.560]  Possibly he's now been banned finally by Twitter, but for a long time he was circulating
[39:27.560 --> 39:34.480]  jihadist propaganda and calling for the annihilation of entire groups of people on Twitter.
[39:34.480 --> 39:35.480]  Nothing happened to him.
[39:35.480 --> 39:37.160]  Oh, zero hedge, though.
[39:37.160 --> 39:40.360]  They questioned the source of the coronavirus outbreak.
[39:40.360 --> 39:44.720]  They were immediately banned and we're going to get onto that story in a minute.
[39:44.720 --> 39:51.360]  But this Muslim cleric came out with a fatwa issued by Telegram and he said, yes, he was
[39:51.360 --> 39:56.520]  responding to a question as to whether Muslim people should pray for the, quote, annihilation
[39:56.520 --> 39:58.760]  of Chinese people.
[39:58.760 --> 40:03.280]  The cleric responded they, the Chinese, had declared resounding war and they killed slaughtered
[40:03.280 --> 40:05.720]  in prison and oppressed the Uyghurs and non-Uyghur Muslims.
[40:05.720 --> 40:09.360]  They are the enemies of Allah and our Buddhists and communists.
[40:09.360 --> 40:11.840]  So he's calling for their complete annihilation.
[40:11.840 --> 40:13.920]  He had a presence on Twitter.
[40:13.920 --> 40:20.960]  But again, that's not the main concern in terms of spreading racism, bigotry about the coronavirus.
[40:20.960 --> 40:25.280]  The main concern is bat soup memes.
[40:25.280 --> 40:31.520]  Now if you read the World Health Organization's official statement on Friday, I believe, actually
[40:31.520 --> 40:37.040]  is on Thursday when they actually elevated it to a global health emergency.
[40:37.040 --> 40:42.800]  During several, in several passages in that statement, the World Health Organization itself
[40:42.800 --> 40:49.960]  seemed to be more concerned about bigotry, stigma and discrimination regarding the coronavirus.
[40:49.960 --> 40:51.920]  Then they were the actual spread of the disease.
[40:51.920 --> 40:58.040]  I read the entire statement, the articles up on Summit News headline, WHO orders countries
[40:58.040 --> 41:04.000]  not to engage in stigma or discrimination in response to coronavirus outbreak.
[41:04.000 --> 41:09.400]  In their official statement, declaring the global health emergency, the WHO stressed
[41:09.400 --> 41:14.400]  that they are not recommending, quote, any travel or trade restriction based on the current
[41:14.400 --> 41:21.960]  information available because God forbid that we should challenge the necessity of the global
[41:21.960 --> 41:27.600]  migration of people even at risk of creating a global pandemic because, of course, it's
[41:27.600 --> 41:32.400]  more important in every step of the way.
[41:32.400 --> 41:35.000]  Numerous countries have closed their borders with China.
[41:35.000 --> 41:38.320]  Pilots and flight attendants in America are demanding an immediate halt to all flights
[41:38.320 --> 41:39.320]  out of China.
[41:39.320 --> 41:46.440]  Some airliners in the US have actually carried that through, but the WHO appears to rank
[41:46.440 --> 41:51.480]  the threat proposed by profiling above that of preventing a pandemic.
[41:51.480 --> 41:55.640]  This is a quote from their statement when they declared the global health emergency,
[41:55.640 --> 42:00.480]  quote, countries are cautioned against actions that promote stigma or discrimination in line
[42:00.480 --> 42:03.080]  with the principles of the IHR.
[42:03.080 --> 42:07.560]  At the end of their statement, the WHO again insisted that maintaining the, quote, international
[42:07.560 --> 42:12.600]  traffic of people was essential and should not be interfered with.
[42:12.600 --> 42:17.600]  And they go on to make a further statement again, insisting that nations will have to
[42:17.600 --> 42:24.760]  report to them under threat of sanctions if they do that without the WHO's permission.
[42:24.760 --> 42:29.600]  This is yet another example of how the mass movement of people is more important to globalist
[42:29.600 --> 42:34.360]  authorities than stopping a potential global pandemic.
[42:34.360 --> 42:38.320]  If travel from China had been shut down earlier, the virus had not now been at least 23 different
[42:38.320 --> 42:42.320]  countries, probably more countries by now.
[42:42.320 --> 42:46.560]  So we have the WHO telling countries that they can't basically profile in trying to
[42:46.560 --> 42:48.480]  stop this coronavirus spreading.
[42:48.480 --> 42:54.680]  We also have this article, WHO demands gratitude and respect for Chinese dictators' coronavirus
[42:54.680 --> 42:55.680]  response.
[42:55.680 --> 42:57.880]  So they're praising the communist government.
[42:57.880 --> 43:00.840]  It's no secret that our daily lives are becoming more stressful.
[43:00.840 --> 43:04.440]  No matter what side of the political spectrum you're on, we're all feeling the strain from
[43:04.440 --> 43:05.440]  rising pressure.

[45:05.640 --> 45:06.640]  the coronavirus.
[45:06.640 --> 45:10.560]  He has now infected hundreds and hundreds of thousands of people.
[45:10.560 --> 45:14.040]  It has now spread across the entire planet.
[45:14.040 --> 45:18.080]  And of course, we've now discovered that indeed it is man-made and engineered.
[45:18.080 --> 45:22.480]  We're covering it live, all with our team at infowarstore.com for a smart show and band
[45:22.480 --> 45:23.480]  on video.
[45:23.480 --> 45:29.800]  And on top of that, we have the patented nano silver that Congress A&M and Homeland Security
[45:29.800 --> 45:35.040]  have certified is able to take out the corona family viruses and SARS.
[45:35.040 --> 45:36.320]  That's what it comes out of.
[45:36.320 --> 45:40.920]  We have that at 40% off despite the fact that it's selling out in three different sizes
[45:40.920 --> 45:48.200]  at infowarstore.com, and that's what I'm using, what my family's using as a frontline defense.
[45:48.200 --> 45:52.880]  Nothing's perfect except prayer in God's intervention, and we hope that this thing isn't as bad as
[45:52.880 --> 45:53.880]  it looks.
[45:53.880 --> 45:58.280]  But definitely, we know why governments are panicking right now because this is certainly
[45:58.280 --> 45:59.800]  a bizarre virus.
[45:59.800 --> 46:02.560]  We're seeing unprecedented orders for storeable foods.
[46:02.560 --> 46:05.520]  I would have storeable foods because 2020 is a very dangerous year.
[46:05.520 --> 46:07.200]  The bubble is so huge and could pop.
[46:07.200 --> 46:08.200]  I hope it doesn't.
[46:08.200 --> 46:10.200]  It's incredibly dangerous and a little cause.
[46:10.200 --> 46:12.800]  Well, you don't need me to tell you what'll happen if this giant bubble pops.
[46:12.800 --> 46:16.040]  So I've been promoting storeable foods to everybody because they're high quality.
[46:16.040 --> 46:17.200]  It's insurance you can eat.
[46:17.200 --> 46:18.440]  It lasts 25 years.
[46:18.440 --> 46:21.840]  We go out and find the very best companies that have the very best quality at the very
[46:21.840 --> 46:24.320]  lowest price, and that's my Patriot supply.
[46:24.320 --> 46:27.920]  And then so that I have my own private label of their full spectrum of food, we private
[46:27.920 --> 46:33.400]  label it as infowarselect, and they are saying that they've never sold this much food.
[46:33.400 --> 46:37.400]  They're still able within seven to 10 days to ship it to you if you get your orders in
[46:37.400 --> 46:42.320]  on their small orders, their big orders, seven to 10 days, it will be shipped out to you
[46:42.320 --> 46:44.080]  if you get your order in now.
[46:44.080 --> 46:48.720]  But just as sure as the sun came up, it's all selling out right now, so get your orders
[46:48.720 --> 46:52.400]  in for high quality storeable foods right now for all the reasons out there, and it's
[46:52.400 --> 47:02.120]  insurance you can eat, and it funds the info war a total 360 win infowarstore.com.
[47:02.120 --> 47:25.360]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[47:25.360 --> 47:35.560]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[47:35.560 --> 47:39.960]  From the beginning, I wondered, is this all just hype?
[47:39.960 --> 47:46.200]  We've never seen a government response unified across the world acting like this coronavirus
[47:46.200 --> 47:52.520]  could be the plague that they've been warning of so long.
[47:52.520 --> 47:56.680]  But of course they use the threat of plagues to push the vaccines that are tainted in most
[47:56.680 --> 48:02.240]  cases that are really the hidden plague that soft kill and runs in slow motion.
[48:02.240 --> 48:06.560]  The globalists I've learned don't like big giant frontal assaults, big obvious things.
[48:06.560 --> 48:11.320]  They want stealth, they want silent weapons for quiet wars.
[48:11.320 --> 48:15.880]  But now with the information coming out about it having the HIV delivery system in it, and
[48:15.880 --> 48:21.440]  now the attempt to cover all that up, and the huge, huge push to suppress any discussion
[48:21.440 --> 48:29.360]  of it, and to not send out to medical facilities and research laboratories, the RNA sequence
[48:29.360 --> 48:34.760]  of this thing, clearly it is man-made and they're trying to cover up the fact it's very obviously
[48:34.760 --> 48:39.400]  man-made, which means it was probably released by accident.
[48:39.400 --> 48:43.240]  And that's why there's such a giant response, because governments are trying to cover their
[48:43.240 --> 48:48.040]  ass now, because this can bring down the whole globalist corporate structure even further.
[48:48.040 --> 48:49.880]  This does not strengthen globalism.
[48:49.880 --> 48:54.560]  This weakens globalism, if they get caught being the culprit that either leaked it or
[48:54.560 --> 48:57.880]  the vaccine went terribly wrong.
[48:57.880 --> 49:03.000]  So this is a big deal, and Info Wars is under massive hack attack every day at other forms
[49:03.000 --> 49:06.200]  of sabotage and massive censorship, because they don't want this getting out.
[49:06.200 --> 49:10.520]  That's why you spreading these articles and videos is the entire mission, if you choose
[49:10.520 --> 49:11.520]  to accept it.
[49:11.520 --> 49:13.560]  And I'm not just saying you're critical, you know that.
[49:13.560 --> 49:17.960]  It's your human intelligence that's able to spread this information far and wide from
[49:17.960 --> 49:22.560]  person to person on email, by text message, however you can get around the censors.
[49:22.560 --> 49:27.560]  That's why now, Facebook's coming in with its WhatsApp and censoring Alex Jones and
[49:27.560 --> 49:32.040]  Jordan Peterson, again saying the precedent that they're watching you in live time.
[49:32.040 --> 49:35.960]  Of course, it came out over the weekend, the Pentagon has been funding millions of dollars
[49:35.960 --> 49:42.280]  in research with major universities to have a Lexis or a Lexis style systems that listen
[49:42.280 --> 49:46.960]  to the barracks for political incorrect statements and then punish people.
[49:46.960 --> 49:51.080]  So it's always been the police state minder, and now they want to make it ubiquitous to
[49:51.080 --> 49:55.880]  make it the law to have these in our corporations, in our military, and then in our homes finally,
[49:55.880 --> 49:58.480]  the little robot sentinel watching us.
[49:58.480 --> 50:05.320]  So this is 1984 officially happening, and they're just standardizing everything.
[50:05.320 --> 50:08.800]  And later coming up at the end of the second hour, I'm going to be here live when Tom
[50:08.800 --> 50:13.160]  Pappert is here, Paul Watson is hosting right now, and I'm going to be laying all of this
[50:13.160 --> 50:14.680]  out, but you heard me right.
[50:14.680 --> 50:19.280]  The home assistance systems are being studied by the Pentagon, by the globalists embedded
[50:19.280 --> 50:24.400]  within it to spy on the troops to hear what they're saying, and then have them be punished
[50:24.400 --> 50:28.120]  with reports that are sent to the officers above them.
[50:28.120 --> 50:31.600]  That's the level of control we're talking about, that they're trying to just condition
[50:31.600 --> 50:32.600]  us to accept.
[50:32.600 --> 50:39.240]  Now that said separately, there's a way to make sure that you're self-sufficient, and
[50:39.240 --> 50:44.000]  there's a way to protect yourself, and there's a way to also set yourself on the path of
[50:44.000 --> 50:45.000]  getting to think like that.
[50:45.000 --> 50:49.040]  And I'm talking to myself when I say this, it's time to get prepared.
[50:49.040 --> 50:51.760]  We aren't selling high-quality, affordable food.
[50:51.760 --> 50:56.680]  We actually have it in stock, ready to ship from our supplier.
[50:56.680 --> 50:59.600]  They just have to package it, but they actually have the food.
[50:59.600 --> 51:03.560]  Take seven to 10 days, they are going to end up selling out very, very soon, but if you
[51:03.560 --> 51:07.240]  get your orders in right now, you're guaranteed within seven to 10 days to get it.
[51:07.240 --> 51:08.240]  And a lot of people are responding.
[51:08.240 --> 51:11.880]  In fact, this is the highest volume we've ever seen, it's continuing.
[51:11.880 --> 51:17.120]  Because people understand this is serious, and this is 2020, and there's so many other
[51:17.120 --> 51:21.800]  big issues happening that are coming together in a cascade of events that people instinctively
[51:21.800 --> 51:23.600]  understand now it's time to get ready.
[51:23.600 --> 51:27.640]  Well, when you get storeable food from us, it funds the M4, it's high-quality, it's
[51:27.640 --> 51:31.320]  a great price, and it actually gets delivered to you, because I have relationships with
[51:31.320 --> 51:35.760]  people over decades that I trust, that's how I do business, and I want to treat you like
[51:35.760 --> 51:36.760]  I want to be treated.
[51:36.760 --> 51:40.360]  So I want to thank all of you that have got your storeable food at m4sware.com, powered
[51:40.360 --> 51:45.120]  by my Patriot, and Ready Hour, but I want to just encourage everybody else out there
[51:45.120 --> 51:48.080]  who's been on the fence, now is the time to take action to get this high-quality, storeable
[51:48.080 --> 51:53.160]  food at m4sware.com, we have their full catalog, they drop ships by the hour, they're in our
[51:53.160 --> 51:57.440]  back end, they're in our computer system, we're partnered with them, and so you're basically
[51:57.440 --> 52:00.440]  just making your order with them, and you make it with us, but then that helps fund
[52:00.440 --> 52:06.920]  the M4, an absolute total 360 win, and separately immune gargle is going to sell out one of
[52:06.920 --> 52:11.160]  the bottle sizes within just two or three days, the others within a week and a half or so
[52:11.160 --> 52:17.360]  maximum, I'm still keeping it at 40 to 50% off right now at m4sware.com, and go research
[52:17.360 --> 52:23.000]  the immune gargle and what it's got in it, the patented nano silver, and what the Pentagon
[52:23.000 --> 52:27.320]  said about this nano silver, and what the head of Homeland Security said in a secret
[52:27.320 --> 52:32.920]  letter that we were able to get about it, I mean that is just amazing, that again m4s
[52:32.920 --> 52:37.240]  is always right there in the zeitgeist, and that's God's providence, so get your immune
[52:37.240 --> 52:41.840]  gargle, get your nano silver, whitening toothpaste, the super silver has the nano silver as well
[52:41.840 --> 52:46.800]  with the iodine, and it's just another defense you can give your body, another system to
[52:46.800 --> 52:50.480]  bolster you and your family, so again back to Paul Watson, I'll let him finish up this
[52:50.480 --> 52:54.320]  hour, he'll host a little bit in the next hour, he's got a special report, I just want
[52:54.320 --> 52:58.080]  to encourage everybody to get your immune gargle, and to get your super silver wound
[52:58.080 --> 53:02.280]  gel into your storeable foods now, because with this crazy world, it's the smartest thing
[53:02.280 --> 53:06.480]  to do, and it's just common sense, God helps those that helps themselves, now back to Paul
[53:06.480 --> 53:28.440]  Joseph Watson. So we have the media seemingly more concerned about racist bat suit means
[53:28.440 --> 53:33.640]  than the spread of the coronavirus pandemic, despite the fact that nature is now reporting
[53:33.640 --> 53:39.120]  another peer reviewed study that it does have a probable bat origin, that's in the title
[53:39.120 --> 53:45.240]  of the study, but who the World Health Organization is saying that stigma and discrimination is
[53:45.240 --> 53:50.560]  probably of more concern than actually stopping travel, stopping the spread of the pandemic.
[53:50.560 --> 53:55.360]  Now we have this headline out of Reuters, financial market website zero hedge knocked
[53:55.360 --> 54:01.800]  off Twitter over coronavirus story, Twitter Inc, and this happened, I think it was Saturday
[54:01.800 --> 54:06.520]  night has banned financial market website zero hedge from the social media platform,
[54:06.520 --> 54:10.520]  after it published an article linking a Chinese scientist to the outbreak of the fast spreading
[54:10.520 --> 54:17.440]  coronavirus last week. Now zero hedge said that they were banned for quote violating
[54:17.440 --> 54:23.320]  Twitter's rules against abuse and harassment, because Twitter claimed or the claim was being
[54:23.320 --> 54:29.640]  made that zero hedge had published a docs against a Chinese virologist accusing him
[54:29.640 --> 54:35.080]  of potentially being the source of the coronavirus outbreak. And that that was the reason for
[54:35.080 --> 54:41.600]  their ban, despite the fact that the information zero hedge posted was publicly available.
[54:41.600 --> 54:48.120]  So that does not reach the definition of a docs. But then the article continues Twitter
[54:48.120 --> 54:52.720]  confirmed to Reuters on Sunday, zero hedges accountants platform have been permanently
[54:52.720 --> 54:59.680]  suspended. By the way, they had 670,000 followers for violating quote platform manipulation
[54:59.680 --> 55:05.280]  policy. And it continues to say social media companies, including Twitter and Facebook
[55:05.280 --> 55:11.560]  have pledged to take down accounts that spread misinformation about the virus. So if that's
[55:11.560 --> 55:17.720]  why they got banned for misinformation, this is a new level of de platforming a new level
[55:17.720 --> 55:25.000]  of censorship, beyond bullying and harassment, beyond hate speech, beyond manipulating elections,
[55:25.000 --> 55:30.360]  pure disinformation, who decides what's different this information, Twitter does, the mainstream
[55:30.360 --> 55:35.960]  media does, because this was all triggered by a bus feed hit piece, once again, abusing
[55:35.960 --> 55:43.360]  their platform to take down their competitors, simply for questioning the origin of the coronavirus
[55:43.360 --> 55:47.760]  outbreak. So they've taken it to a new level. By the way, we have another headline here
[55:47.760 --> 55:52.760]  in the same vein, Democrats demand YouTube sensor climate misinformation videos. This
[55:52.760 --> 55:58.240]  is a new level where they can just claim climate change is such an important issue. Coronavirus
[55:58.240 --> 56:02.720]  is such an important issue that if we don't like what you said about it, you get banned
[56:02.720 --> 56:09.920]  on social media. That is a new category of de platforming. And it's all been cascaded
[56:09.920 --> 56:16.120]  into place, be among it into place by this buzzfeed hit piece. And this is an article
[56:16.120 --> 56:22.720]  out of zero hedge. Buzzfeed Journal reportedly blogged about pedophantases, rape jokes and
[56:22.720 --> 56:29.480]  doxing. So the very Buzzfeed journalist who accused zero hedge of doxing contacted Twitter
[56:29.480 --> 56:36.360]  to get the ban for doxing himself has been accused of doxing in the past. And that's
[56:36.360 --> 56:40.720]  not always being accused of. By the way, this is somebody who's tried to de platform me
[56:40.720 --> 56:46.600]  from social media, Alex Jones on numerous occasions. He was part of the drum beat to
[56:46.600 --> 56:53.600]  get Alex Jones back banned back in 2018, Ryan Broderick of Buzzfeed. And he posted a tweet
[56:53.600 --> 56:59.360]  and he's now deleting all these tweets. Let me find it in the article here. This was a
[56:59.360 --> 57:03.920]  tweet from Ryan Broderick. And again, don't try to contact these people. Don't try to
[57:03.920 --> 57:07.800]  harass these people because they'll only claim themselves to be the victims. This is a guy
[57:07.800 --> 57:14.240]  who tweeted, I think this is back in 2012 quote, Mr. President, can you please pass legislation
[57:14.240 --> 57:21.360]  legally defining the difference between us, good nature, Heber files and a moral pedophiles?
[57:21.360 --> 57:25.840]  What is a Heber file or a Heber file, depending on how you want to pronounce it? According
[57:25.840 --> 57:32.680]  to Google, a Heber file is an adult who has a strong and persistent sexual interest in
[57:32.680 --> 57:40.240]  pubescent aged individuals generally aged 11 to 14. Yeah, really, this is who we're
[57:40.240 --> 57:43.920]  up against. This is who's responsible for the de platforming. We'll be back to talk
[57:43.920 --> 57:48.160]  about it more on the other side. breaking news at info wars.com. Don't go away with

[58:51.280 --> 58:55.000]  world governments out in the open. We've got the predicted mass pandemics and they're
[58:55.000 --> 59:00.040]  calling for global government as the answer and we've got massive huge censorship taking
[59:00.040 --> 59:06.480]  place. It's coordinated by big tech and banks against people that promote America and guns
[59:06.480 --> 59:12.400]  and freedom and Jesus and the family and the protection of the unborn. Wow. Yes. Now we
[59:12.400 --> 59:16.960]  know we're right. The new world order is real. Satanism is real. The pedophile leader real,
[59:16.960 --> 59:21.040]  but we're real as well and we love God and we're standing up and saying no. But I just
[59:21.040 --> 59:25.520]  want to make the point here one month into 2020 that we have never been in Kansas. We
[59:25.520 --> 59:30.320]  have never been in some smallville place that didn't matter. Everything we do, every
[59:30.320 --> 59:34.960]  decision we make governs the future of our species and everything we've gone through
[59:34.960 --> 59:37.760]  and everything we're going to go through. So it's an incredible town to be alive. I'm
[59:37.760 --> 59:42.120]  going to thank you all for being aware and being involved. But just remember your action
[59:42.120 --> 59:47.760]  now via prayer word of mouth and financial support of m4 store.com is critical. So please
[59:47.760 --> 1:00:09.640]  take action. You're listening to the Alex Jones show live from the summit dot news headquarters.
[1:00:09.640 --> 1:00:19.080]  Paul Joseph Watson. So the financial website zero hedge, which has an absolutely huge audience
[1:00:19.080 --> 1:00:25.960]  had 670,000 followers on Twitter was banned. Essentially, according to which report you
[1:00:25.960 --> 1:00:31.920]  believe for either doxing a virologist who was accused of working at the Institute, which
[1:00:31.920 --> 1:00:37.980]  many people claim was the source of the Corona virus outbreak there in Wuhan. They either
[1:00:37.980 --> 1:00:42.720]  accuse them of doxing him even though the information was publicly available or which
[1:00:42.720 --> 1:00:47.480]  is more disturbing to me is this claim of spreading disinformation about the Corona
[1:00:47.480 --> 1:00:52.560]  virus outbreak because if that is now the new level of how you get banned the platform
[1:00:52.560 --> 1:00:58.880]  censored, that of course is the broadest possible definition. Anyone can claim anyone is spreading
[1:00:58.880 --> 1:01:05.040]  disinformation. That was one of the reasons zero hedge got banned. The individual behind
[1:01:05.040 --> 1:01:09.400]  it who led the the platforming campaign with by this Buzzfeed article because you know
[1:01:09.400 --> 1:01:14.120]  what they do. They write the article and they reach out to Twitter and say, this person
[1:01:14.120 --> 1:01:18.480]  said this, this, this violates your rules. What action are you going to take? So they
[1:01:18.480 --> 1:01:23.520]  intimidate and bully in many cases. These social media companies, even though they're delighted
[1:01:23.520 --> 1:01:30.120]  to do it into the platforming their competition, that's exactly what happened with zero hedge.
[1:01:30.120 --> 1:01:34.960]  And then after that, zero hedge, probably in what you would call an act of revenge dug
[1:01:34.960 --> 1:01:40.320]  up old tweets by Ryan Broderick, this Buzzfeed reporter in which he's referring to himself
[1:01:40.320 --> 1:01:46.320]  basically as a Heberphile, which means somebody who is attracted to pubescent individuals
[1:01:46.320 --> 1:01:51.640]  aged 11 to 14, according to the definition of a Heberphile. They dug up posts from his
[1:01:51.640 --> 1:01:56.720]  blog, one of which said, quote, I want to be an erotic children's photographer. I want
[1:01:56.720 --> 1:02:02.040]  to be the Andy Warhol of erotic children's photography. Those are alleged quotes from
[1:02:02.040 --> 1:02:08.920]  this individual's blog who led the platforming campaign against zero hedge. Of course, Twitter
[1:02:08.920 --> 1:02:15.760]  has a massive problem with pedophiles. They call them maps or people who express sexual
[1:02:15.760 --> 1:02:20.920]  attraction to minors. They're not banned by Twitter, but zero hedge gets banned for questioning
[1:02:20.920 --> 1:02:26.880]  the coronavirus outbreak. So this reporter now is deleting all his old tweets. But as
[1:02:26.880 --> 1:02:31.840]  we know, the internet is forever. And it's interesting because there's another headline
[1:02:31.840 --> 1:02:36.160]  here from zero hedge India to probe Wuhan Institute of virology. It appears around the
[1:02:36.160 --> 1:02:40.480]  time we suggested that zero hedge, someone reach out to the Wuhan Institute of virology
[1:02:40.480 --> 1:02:45.440]  to get some answers about the origin of the deadly coronavirus epidemic. India was doing
[1:02:45.440 --> 1:02:50.200]  just that. So India's questioning the origin is the country of India going to get banned
[1:02:50.200 --> 1:02:56.760]  by Twitter now. Another headline, China censors top local media outlet over claims Beijing
[1:02:56.760 --> 1:03:02.560]  is under reporting cases and debts. So now Buzzfeed, Twitter and others are in league
[1:03:02.560 --> 1:03:08.880]  with the communist Chinese government in censoring information in banning people who question
[1:03:08.880 --> 1:03:14.440]  the official version of events behind a story. And if that is the new level of censorship,
[1:03:14.440 --> 1:03:20.800]  then we've basically crossed the Rubicon in terms of the platforming. Meanwhile, in Canada,
[1:03:20.800 --> 1:03:26.120]  Trudeau Minister proposes forcing news websites to have a government license. So now it's
[1:03:26.120 --> 1:03:31.080]  not enough to ban you on social media. Now they're going to get in league with domain
[1:03:31.080 --> 1:03:37.800]  hosts, registrars and get people banned from even being allowed to own and operate websites
[1:03:37.800 --> 1:03:43.560]  if they don't get a government license. What is a license? It's permission to do something
[1:03:43.560 --> 1:03:48.840]  that would otherwise be illegal. Breitbart reports Canadian Heritage Minister Stephen
[1:03:48.840 --> 1:03:53.120]  Gilbeau has stated that news websites along with social media companies could be forced
[1:03:53.120 --> 1:03:59.200]  to obtain government licenses to operate in Canada. They grilled him on it during an interview
[1:03:59.200 --> 1:04:04.120]  which I saw last night and he basically said yes, it may apply slightly differently to
[1:04:04.120 --> 1:04:09.680]  smaller media outlets, but it will apply across the board. So of course you have to get permission
[1:04:09.680 --> 1:04:13.800]  to get the license in the first place. Even if you get the license, then if you violate
[1:04:13.800 --> 1:04:18.980]  the terms, the threat is that your website would be pulled. Again, that is yet a new
[1:04:18.980 --> 1:04:24.080]  level of censorship. We've seen websites taken down in the aftermath of mass shootings
[1:04:24.080 --> 1:04:30.680]  by the hosts. And now this is a plan to be introduced across the board via a government
[1:04:30.680 --> 1:04:35.480]  licensing system, which by the way, we predicted that about 10 years ago as we did most of
[1:04:35.480 --> 1:04:41.160]  these things. Meanwhile, Democrats demand YouTube censor climate misinformation videos.
[1:04:41.160 --> 1:04:46.000]  That is the exact same process beyond bullying and harassment, beyond hate speech. If you
[1:04:46.000 --> 1:04:50.800]  come out with quote, misinformation, then you are opening yourself to be deplatformed.
[1:04:50.800 --> 1:04:55.800]  That is a scary level of censorship. We'll be back with more news in 4Wars.com. Don't
[1:04:55.800 --> 1:05:01.880]  go away. It was about a week and a half ago that my father came rushing into my office
[1:05:01.880 --> 1:05:07.080]  in the morning and said, son, you've got to see this. The company that holds the patents
[1:05:07.080 --> 1:05:10.840]  on the nano silver that's in our toothpaste, that's in our immune garden, and that's in
[1:05:10.840 --> 1:05:15.160]  some of the other great products like the super silver wound shell, had reports from
[1:05:15.160 --> 1:05:21.200]  back in 2007 with the Pentagon working with A&M and Homeland Security, with the director
[1:05:21.200 --> 1:05:27.560]  of Homeland Security certifying an unrestricted document, confidential documents was noted
[1:05:27.560 --> 1:05:32.560]  as that this had been proven in their secret test to be knocking out SARS. Well, ladies
[1:05:32.560 --> 1:05:37.720]  and gentlemen, regardless, now they authorized us to talk about this. I talked about it on
[1:05:37.720 --> 1:05:42.720]  the show last week. Just hiding in plain view, this is a product that we had stockpiled and
[1:05:42.720 --> 1:05:47.040]  that we're still selling it 40% off or more with the combos so that you can get it in
[1:05:47.040 --> 1:05:50.480]  your hands. It's something that's good for everyday use regardless and it funds the
[1:05:50.480 --> 1:05:54.880]  operation. So in 4Wars.com for your immune gargle and other products that contain this
[1:05:54.880 --> 1:06:07.520]  keen householder. Broadcasting internationally from the Summit.News headquarters in the
[1:06:07.520 --> 1:06:15.280]  United Kingdom, it's Paul Joseph Watson. So we have an absolutely terrifying situation
[1:06:15.280 --> 1:06:21.680]  where the likes of Buzzfeed and Twitter are now aping and implementing the very same social
[1:06:21.680 --> 1:06:28.800]  credit score Chinese censorship system that China is now deploying to silence people who
[1:06:28.800 --> 1:06:35.920]  question the official story and the official level or severity of the coronavirus outbreak.
[1:06:35.920 --> 1:06:40.240]  Headline, China censors top local media out there over claims Beijing is under reporting
[1:06:40.240 --> 1:06:46.280]  cases deaths. And they go through it where Beijing is now directly censoring people who
[1:06:46.280 --> 1:06:51.560]  say that people getting treated for coronavirus. They're not diagnosing it as coronavirus. They're
[1:06:51.560 --> 1:06:58.440]  diagnosing it as pneumonia in many cases to downplay the numbers and to keep those numbers
[1:06:58.440 --> 1:07:04.360]  artificially low. These are not extremist right wing conspiracy theorists on social
[1:07:04.360 --> 1:07:11.000]  media claiming this. These are experts including Angel Investor and entrepreneur, former CTO
[1:07:11.000 --> 1:07:16.800]  of Coinbase, Bajais Frinsen, who says, Caging is one of the most reputable outlets in China.
[1:07:16.800 --> 1:07:20.840]  Their article on the coronavirus was censored today. It claims significant under reporting
[1:07:20.840 --> 1:07:26.920]  of both cases and deaths, especially among the elderly. And that's exactly the same thing
[1:07:26.920 --> 1:07:32.160]  that Twitter is now imposing, having banned zero hedge for again, questioning the source
[1:07:32.160 --> 1:07:36.680]  of the coronavirus outbreak. Absolutely chilling.
[1:07:36.680 --> 1:07:40.680]  Now we're going to go to a special video report, though. When we talk about demographics,
[1:07:40.680 --> 1:07:45.360]  if you can only do so, if you praise it and say that it's great that white people are
[1:07:45.360 --> 1:07:50.800]  on the decline across the globe, demographically, if you approach the matter in any other way,
[1:07:50.800 --> 1:07:55.480]  then there are different circumstances for that. But this is a video I put out, analyzing
[1:07:55.480 --> 1:08:00.400]  demographic changes around the world, why Western women have stopped having babies.
[1:08:00.400 --> 1:08:02.400]  Here's the clip.
[1:08:02.400 --> 1:08:11.640]  No eggs, empty egg carton, you don't have any eggs. No eggs, empty egg carton, you don't
[1:08:11.640 --> 1:08:12.640]  have any eggs.
[1:08:12.640 --> 1:08:19.240]  But women who want kids, the sooner, the better. 90% of eggs gone by age 30. No eggs.
[1:08:19.240 --> 1:08:24.560]  By the time a woman hits 30, nearly all of her ovarian eggs are gone for good. According
[1:08:24.560 --> 1:08:28.680]  to a new study that says women who put off childbearing for too long could have difficulty
[1:08:28.680 --> 1:08:33.560]  ever conceiving. The study found that women have lost 90% of their eggs by the time they're
[1:08:33.560 --> 1:08:38.160]  30 years old and only have about 3% remaining by the time they are 40.
[1:08:38.160 --> 1:08:43.280]  Make sure you do not overcook it. Now, it's common knowledge that women have more difficulty
[1:08:43.280 --> 1:08:47.600]  conceiving as they age, but this is the very first study believed to quantify the number
[1:08:47.600 --> 1:08:53.720]  of eggs lost and it shows that the decline is more rapid than previously believed. In
[1:08:53.720 --> 1:08:59.040]  Britain, the percentage of childless women has doubled in a generation and for the first
[1:08:59.040 --> 1:09:06.680]  time more than half, 54% of American women aged 25 to 29 are childless. As are nearly
[1:09:06.680 --> 1:09:13.440]  a third, 31% of women aged 30 to 34. Hey yo, egg check. No eggs.
[1:09:13.440 --> 1:09:17.720]  Because in an egg shortage crisis you may not even have known about. If only you knew
[1:09:17.720 --> 1:09:24.240]  how bad things really are. 1,200 childless American women aged 25 to 45 were asked why
[1:09:24.240 --> 1:09:28.640]  they were delaying childbirth. They were allowed to pick more than one answer. What was the
[1:09:28.640 --> 1:09:35.280]  top answer? I want to focus on my career. No. A more popular answer than that was quote,
[1:09:35.280 --> 1:09:41.080]  I want to have life experience. And almost as popular as the career answer was the answer
[1:09:41.080 --> 1:09:53.040]  that they quote, value freedom and don't want to be tied down.
[1:09:53.040 --> 1:09:57.560]  Big doubt. Sex and the City writer Candace Bushnell, 60, admits she regrets choosing
[1:09:57.560 --> 1:10:03.600]  a career over having children as she is now truly alone. Freedom. What happens when you
[1:10:03.600 --> 1:10:08.480]  socially engineer women to get out of the home and into the boardroom, to get out of
[1:10:08.480 --> 1:10:14.360]  nurturing children and into chasing pointless college degrees, to get out of stable monogamous
[1:10:14.360 --> 1:10:20.120]  relationships and into the toxic hellscape of hypergamous dating and extracting beta books
[1:10:20.120 --> 1:10:30.760]  from simps on social media. What happens? No eggs. No eggs. No eggs. No eggs. No eggs.
[1:10:30.760 --> 1:10:41.280]  The hypersexualization of our abortion on demand culture is brainwashing girls to swap
[1:10:41.280 --> 1:10:47.800]  life affirming monogamy for rampant promiscuity. The number of STDs in America has reached
[1:10:47.800 --> 1:10:55.320]  a record high with 2.4 million reported cases of chlamydia, gonorrhea and syphilis in 2018.
[1:10:55.320 --> 1:11:01.320]  In David Cronenberg's 1975 movie Shivers, a mad scientist creates a parasite that makes
[1:11:01.320 --> 1:11:07.620]  the residents of a high-rise residential tower act like sex-craved carnal animals. The motive
[1:11:07.620 --> 1:11:12.960]  of the scientist was to use a combination of aphrodisiac and venereal disease to turn
[1:11:12.960 --> 1:11:19.720]  the world into one huge mindless orgy. And in our world, the entertainment industry is
[1:11:19.720 --> 1:11:28.240]  that parasite. Our culture is that one huge mindless orgy. Have you ever noticed how these
[1:11:28.240 --> 1:11:35.280]  same entertainment and media corporations that harp on about respecting women and opposing
[1:11:35.280 --> 1:11:42.240]  objectification and misogyny literally groom underage female celebrities into superstar
[1:11:42.240 --> 1:11:48.040]  status, then begin salivating about the prospect of sexualizing them right before they're about
[1:11:48.040 --> 1:11:54.600]  to turn 18. Then relentlessly exploit them for the next 20 years by hypersexualizing everything
[1:11:54.600 --> 1:12:00.840]  they do for the consumption of teenage girls. What message does that send? What role models
[1:12:00.840 --> 1:12:06.400]  do teenage girls have? Who aren't scantily clad hoes? Working around to canned pop songs
[1:12:06.400 --> 1:12:12.120]  written by computer algorithms owned by Sony, UMG and Warner, Billie Eilish says she may
[1:12:12.120 --> 1:12:17.680]  want to show her body and look desirable in a music video after she turns 18. The bad
[1:12:17.680 --> 1:12:22.160]  guy singer said in a new interview that she wanted the option to show her body when she
[1:12:22.160 --> 1:12:27.680]  turned 18. An about face from her previous statement saying she purposefully wore baggy
[1:12:27.680 --> 1:12:33.000]  and oversized clothes to hide her body from would be body shamers. Gee, I wonder what
[1:12:33.000 --> 1:12:38.560]  male corporate executive at the biggest music company in the world convinced her to do that.
[1:12:38.560 --> 1:12:44.160]  Have you ever noticed how corporations relentlessly virtue signal about how much they respect
[1:12:44.160 --> 1:12:49.160]  whammyn about how it's imperative to get more women in the boardroom and how it's crucial
[1:12:49.160 --> 1:12:53.880]  to help women overcome objectification by adopting affirmative action policies that
[1:12:53.880 --> 1:12:59.760]  help them obtain powerful positions in society while simultaneously engineering society and
[1:12:59.760 --> 1:13:05.760]  building platforms that encourage the exact opposite. Platforms that incentivize women
[1:13:05.760 --> 1:13:15.520]  to behave like thoughts whose only value comes from being objectified by men. What is Instagram?
[1:13:15.520 --> 1:13:20.480]  It's a virtual red light district for women to parade themselves, lewd and half naked
[1:13:20.480 --> 1:13:26.160]  for the approval of thirsty dudes. What is TikTok? It's a platform marketed to teenagers
[1:13:26.160 --> 1:13:32.000]  which incentivizes underage girls to act like burlesque dancers in strip clubs for the viewing
[1:13:32.000 --> 1:13:51.360]  pleasure of sex crazed teenage boys and literal pedos. Which in turn incentivizes the girls
[1:13:51.360 --> 1:14:15.720]  watching to mimic that behavior and chase the same dopamine. What is Onlyfans? What is
[1:14:15.720 --> 1:14:21.840]  Premium Snatcha? Virtual prostitution meat markets where men pay women to sexually degrade
[1:14:21.840 --> 1:14:27.640]  themselves. E-prostitution is killing traditional courtship and romance. If women behave like
[1:14:27.640 --> 1:14:33.320]  prostitutes online, men are going to treat them like prostitutes in real life and that's
[1:14:33.320 --> 1:15:00.440]  not wife material. And is it really making you happy? That 56% increase in suicide rates
[1:15:00.440 --> 1:15:08.360]  amongst 10 to 24 year olds between 2007 and 2017 coinciding with the rise of social media.
[1:15:08.360 --> 1:15:14.120]  Is that not enough? The age of the ethos has socially indoctrinated girls and young women
[1:15:14.120 --> 1:15:20.280]  to think that it's normal to be intimate with the entire world. It's not. You're only supposed
[1:15:20.280 --> 1:15:25.600]  to be intimate with your relationship partner. You're only supposed to send sexy pics to
[1:15:25.600 --> 1:15:30.480]  your boyfriend. You're not supposed to share them with the entirety of simp nation. And
[1:15:30.480 --> 1:15:35.440]  if you do that, you're not a content creator. You're basically a sex worker. Is it any
[1:15:35.440 --> 1:15:41.080]  wonder that doctors are now on tiktok telling 12 year olds to get STD treatments without
[1:15:41.080 --> 1:15:57.040]  their parents knowledge? Gross. And before you call me a misogynist. We can all agree

[1:17:51.720 --> 1:17:57.640]  purchasing. Not an offer to buy or sell a security which requires an offering document.
[1:17:57.640 --> 1:18:03.000]  The demand for food has not let up. We are selling record amounts of it. Everybody else
[1:18:03.000 --> 1:18:08.320]  is basically already sold out or they have giant wait list. Our suppliers have it in
[1:18:08.320 --> 1:18:13.200]  house, mistaken seven to ten days to deliver because again, they have to package it. They're
[1:18:13.200 --> 1:18:18.160]  running 24 hours a day. But in a few days, they're telling me it may go to a longer wait
[1:18:18.160 --> 1:18:22.240]  if you haven't gotten your order in. So, I wouldn't crash the name. We wanted this virus
[1:18:22.240 --> 1:18:26.440]  to be peering out. We wanted it to just be hype. Looks like it is really, really bad
[1:18:26.440 --> 1:18:31.040]  and it is man-made. And so, that's why we're seeing the huge freakouts. So, get your storable

[1:18:47.680 --> 1:18:51.800]  regardless, it funds the operation. We also have the immune gargle at 40% off. We are
[1:18:51.800 --> 1:18:56.680]  going to sell out of that, but I'm just keeping it at that sales price, infowarsestore.com.

[1:20:04.080 --> 1:20:11.800]  Gross. And before you call me a misogynist, I just did a 15 minute video in which I explain
[1:20:11.800 --> 1:20:16.440]  how men are partially to blame for all this. Men who support their girl doing only fans
[1:20:16.440 --> 1:20:25.440]  have big dick energy. Men who support their girl prostituting herself to other men. Big
[1:20:25.440 --> 1:20:30.400]  dick energy. Yeah, you misspelled cook. Why you're posting the empty egg carton underneath
[1:20:30.400 --> 1:20:34.760]  18 year old girls? Like I like the enthusiasm, but I don't think you get the meme because
[1:20:34.760 --> 1:20:42.800]  it's a warning and a prediction. Without intervention, the ethot is biologically predestined to become
[1:20:42.800 --> 1:20:49.080]  eggless. Social media and symptom is radicalizing an entire generation of zoomer girls to eschew
[1:20:49.080 --> 1:21:05.360]  traditional monogamous courtship and pursue degenerate hedonism. Stop chasing beta books.
[1:21:05.360 --> 1:21:13.120]  Stop chasing clout. Get off the internet and find Mr Eggman. $5 a month. How do you have
[1:21:13.120 --> 1:21:20.360]  hours of time to watch me and not $5? Maybe give them access to a separate intranet that
[1:21:20.360 --> 1:21:26.880]  only contains cooking recipes. That's a joke. Can someone explain what the fuck this means?
[1:21:26.880 --> 1:21:31.240]  The E in E girl stands for eggless. I will not stop until every female is banned from
[1:21:31.240 --> 1:21:49.200]  social media. Don't test my stupid thoughts. Disavow. Take the egg pill. We need to save
[1:21:49.200 --> 1:22:07.660]  her.
[1:22:07.660 --> 1:22:24.240]  The media is telling women two massive lies, one that it's easy to have babies in your
[1:22:24.240 --> 1:22:32.420]  late 30s and early 40s, it isn't no eggs, and two that polls show childless older women
[1:22:32.420 --> 1:22:37.900]  are happier than women who had children, so why not just sleep around for eternity?
[1:22:37.900 --> 1:22:38.900]  Bullshit!
[1:22:38.900 --> 1:22:42.860]  Of course 40 and 50 year old women are going to tell pollsters that they're happier for
[1:22:42.860 --> 1:22:44.180]  not having children.
[1:22:44.180 --> 1:22:49.380]  If they were honest, they'd have to concede that they'd made a monumental life mistake
[1:22:49.380 --> 1:22:51.060]  that could never be rectified.
[1:22:51.060 --> 1:22:55.260]  When you read accounts from women who are being honest about not having kids, they're
[1:22:55.260 --> 1:22:57.380]  always hugely regretful.
[1:22:57.380 --> 1:23:01.900]  Western women are also being shamed out of having children in the name of preventing
[1:23:01.900 --> 1:23:03.420]  climate change.
[1:23:03.420 --> 1:23:08.940]  Childless couples are exalted by the media as having done their bit to stop global warming.
[1:23:08.940 --> 1:23:13.900]  Feminist author Verena Brunschweiger recently told German women that the only way to prevent
[1:23:13.900 --> 1:23:19.540]  ecological collapse was, quote, the renunciation of one's own reproduction.
[1:23:19.540 --> 1:23:24.460]  But even if you believe that overpopulation is contributing to climate change, why is
[1:23:24.460 --> 1:23:28.500]  that message only being targeted at women in the West?
[1:23:28.500 --> 1:23:32.140]  Germany's fertility rate is 1.4 births per women.
[1:23:32.140 --> 1:23:35.260]  That's well below the 2.1 replacement rate.
[1:23:35.260 --> 1:23:37.620]  German women aren't having babies.
[1:23:37.620 --> 1:23:44.100]  Since 1972, Germany hasn't seen a single year where the number of newborns has exceeded
[1:23:44.100 --> 1:23:45.420]  the number of deaths.
[1:23:45.420 --> 1:23:52.340]  Meanwhile, Africa's child population will reach one billion by 2055, making it the largest
[1:23:52.340 --> 1:23:55.380]  child population among all continents.
[1:23:55.380 --> 1:23:58.740]  No one is telling Africans to stop breeding.
[1:23:58.740 --> 1:23:59.940]  That would be racist.
[1:23:59.940 --> 1:24:02.380]  You know what else is racist?
[1:24:02.380 --> 1:24:03.820]  White women having babies.
[1:24:03.820 --> 1:24:06.860]  Who needs YouTube rabbit holes when you have the BBC broadcasting
[1:24:06.860 --> 1:24:09.660]  Literal White Supremacist Propaganda?
[1:24:09.660 --> 1:24:13.780]  White Supremacist Propaganda must be pretty bad, right?
[1:24:13.780 --> 1:24:18.340]  Will introduce you to a tradwife, a young woman who has chosen to be a traditional wife staying
[1:24:18.340 --> 1:24:19.340]  at home.
[1:24:19.340 --> 1:24:20.340]  Oh my God!
[1:24:20.340 --> 1:24:24.940]  Black imbeciles, traditional gender roles that have existed in society, the vast majority
[1:24:24.940 --> 1:24:30.860]  of them non-white, since literally the dawn of humankind, is this white supremacy?
[1:24:30.860 --> 1:24:38.980]  First off, first off, first off, the wedge.
[1:24:38.980 --> 1:24:43.620]  But I guess it's really important to shame white women out of having babies because they're
[1:24:43.620 --> 1:24:46.540]  just popping them out all over the place, aren't they?
[1:24:46.540 --> 1:24:48.700]  As it turns out, no, no they're not.
[1:24:48.700 --> 1:24:51.060]  How do fertility rates compare globally?
[1:24:51.060 --> 1:24:54.060]  Let's take a look at the egg chart.
[1:24:54.060 --> 1:25:00.420]  Africa has by far the highest fertility in the world, with Niger number one at 7.0 births
[1:25:00.420 --> 1:25:03.540]  for women and Somalia number two at 6.2.
[1:25:03.540 --> 1:25:09.020]  The top 20 countries on the planet with the highest fertility are all in Africa.
[1:25:09.020 --> 1:25:14.380]  The three countries with the highest fertility rate in Europe are France at 1.9, Sweden at
[1:25:14.380 --> 1:25:17.460]  1.78 and Ireland at 1.77.
[1:25:17.460 --> 1:25:22.980]  All countries that have accepted large numbers of migrants with high fertility rates from
[1:25:22.980 --> 1:25:24.460]  Africa and the Middle East.
[1:25:24.460 --> 1:25:30.980]  So despite its relatively high birth rate in European terms, ethnic Swedes will be a minority
[1:25:30.980 --> 1:25:34.700]  in all major Swedish cities within a generation.
[1:25:34.700 --> 1:25:40.020]  Countries in Europe with significantly lower birth rates include Poland at 1.38 births per
[1:25:40.020 --> 1:25:42.700]  woman and Hungary at 1.45.
[1:25:42.700 --> 1:25:47.660]  Two countries that have accepted comparatively fewer migrants from Africa and the Middle
[1:25:47.660 --> 1:25:48.660]  East.
[1:25:48.660 --> 1:25:52.980]  Countries with high fertility rates in South Asia and the Middle East include Pakistan at
[1:25:52.980 --> 1:25:58.060]  3.8, Iraq at 3.8 and Egypt at 3.4.
[1:25:58.060 --> 1:26:02.700]  America's fertility rate currently stands at 1.8 births per woman.
[1:26:02.700 --> 1:26:10.500]  In 2016, the US fertility rate fell to just under 60 births per 1,000 women, the lowest
[1:26:10.500 --> 1:26:12.500]  since records began.
[1:26:12.500 --> 1:26:17.820]  Fertility rates for white women were down in every US state in 2017 while among black
[1:26:17.820 --> 1:26:22.900]  and Hispanic women, fertility rates were up in 12 and 29 states respectively.
[1:26:22.900 --> 1:26:45.300]  And while there's a clear cause of link between living in a more economically
[1:26:45.300 --> 1:27:06.660]  American-
[1:27:06.660 --> 1:27:11.360]  out. Many people watched it, but it was truly disturbing. Some of the most demonic dancing
[1:27:11.360 --> 1:27:16.560]  in front of children in white dresses that I've ever seen in my life. We'll be going
[1:27:16.560 --> 1:27:21.280]  deep into all of this right here on the Alex Jones show. I'm Tom Papert filling in for
[1:27:21.280 --> 1:27:27.680]  Alex and again, he will be joining us very, very shortly. Wild horses literally cannot
[1:27:27.680 --> 1:27:33.720]  drag him away nor can his wife who just desperately wants to get out of town. And while we got
[1:27:33.720 --> 1:27:38.680]  just a minute left, I want to go through a couple of these crazy articles we've got in
[1:27:38.680 --> 1:27:43.220]  front of us here. Number one thing that I think is going to be crucial as we go into
[1:27:43.220 --> 1:27:48.180]  this Corona virus insanity. The insanity is not just happening in China. It's happening
[1:27:48.180 --> 1:27:53.820]  in the mainstream news here in the West. Fears of a new virus trigger anti China sentiment
[1:27:53.820 --> 1:27:59.060]  worldwide. So if this virus is a worst case scenario, we could have tens of millions
[1:27:59.060 --> 1:28:02.380]  of people dead. I mean, that's just where we're at. Now, I hope that doesn't happen.
[1:28:02.380 --> 1:28:06.380]  I certainly hope that it is contained in China. I hope that it can be cured with powerful
[1:28:06.380 --> 1:28:12.580]  HIV Medicaid medicine as is being reported. But if not be prepared to be called racist,
[1:28:12.580 --> 1:28:16.740]  not because you are not because you're saying bad things about the Chinese people who have
[1:28:16.740 --> 1:28:22.300]  suffered for generations under the yoke of communism. No, be prepared to be called racist
[1:28:22.300 --> 1:28:28.860]  for being a little bit concerned with a massive virus that is killing God knows how many people
[1:28:28.860 --> 1:28:33.820]  we now believe it's somewhere like 60 70,000 people according to a recent study who are
[1:28:33.820 --> 1:28:40.060]  contaminated who are sick with Corona virus. Who knows how many more asymptomatic. It's
[1:28:40.060 --> 1:28:44.340]  a big mystery and we're not allowed to talk about it because then you're racist. This
[1:28:44.340 --> 1:28:50.140]  is the Alex Jones show. I'm Tom Papper will be joined by Alex very shortly. Don't go away.
[1:28:50.140 --> 1:28:59.100]  I'm Tom Papper again. National file dot com fellow patriots. My name is Todd Savage, founder
[1:28:59.100 --> 1:29:03.500]  of black rifle real estate dot com. Like you, I was a prisoner of the out left sanctuary

[1:29:56.900 --> 1:30:01.940]  We now know that more than 60 million people are on total lockdown in China and the food
[1:30:01.940 --> 1:30:06.060]  supplies and medical supplies are running out. We know the virus has already spread
[1:30:06.060 --> 1:30:11.300]  to more than a dozen countries and many Chinese who escaped Wuhan are now confirmed to be
[1:30:11.300 --> 1:30:16.740]  arriving on the United States West Coast. We've now confirmed from major food suppliers across
[1:30:16.740 --> 1:30:20.860]  the United States that they've already run out of supplies of affordable foods because
[1:30:20.860 --> 1:30:25.340]  of institutional and governmental buyers. That's right, the rich, the powerful, the elite, big
[1:30:25.340 --> 1:30:30.500]  corporations are now buying up food stores at alarming rates. Info wars, private labels
[1:30:30.500 --> 1:30:35.180]  from my patriot supply and ships right out of the very same factory. They called and
[1:30:35.180 --> 1:30:39.380]  let us know that they have bought food forward, but that's going to run out probably in a
[1:30:39.380 --> 1:30:43.780]  few weeks and that people need to order now. They want to be able to get it within seven
[1:30:43.780 --> 1:30:48.540]  to 10 days, but if people wait, it may end up being longer. But if you get your order
[1:30:48.540 --> 1:30:54.860]  in now and in full war store dot com, you will be secured to get the food within seven
[1:30:54.860 --> 1:30:57.580]  to 10 days.
[1:30:57.580 --> 1:31:02.860]  It's amazing that we have the only patented nano silver that's been found by Homeland
[1:31:02.860 --> 1:31:08.660]  Security to take out SARS, which is the same family as the Corona virus. We have it in
[1:31:08.660 --> 1:31:14.340]  our super silver toothpaste. We have it in our super blue toothpaste. We have it in the
[1:31:14.340 --> 1:31:19.700]  immune gargle products. And of course, it's in the super silver wound gel that is sold
[1:31:19.700 --> 1:31:24.820]  nationally. We just private label it from the people that produce the nano tech company
[1:31:24.820 --> 1:31:31.500]  out of Colorado. And we have a stockpile of it, but we've already sold half of the stockpile
[1:31:31.500 --> 1:31:37.700]  of it. And I'm still offering the products at 40 to 50% off and then full war store dot
[1:31:37.700 --> 1:31:43.220]  com until they sell out, which most of these products are set to sell out within days or
[1:31:43.220 --> 1:31:47.540]  then about another week. So go to info or store dot com to get your immune gargle to
[1:31:47.540 --> 1:31:51.740]  get the toothpaste and to get the super silver wound gel. But the immune gargle is what is
[1:31:51.740 --> 1:31:58.100]  so important because you gargle with it and can also drink it in four store dot com.
[1:31:58.100 --> 1:32:03.940]  This should really be easier than it is. I'm not here giving you a sales pitch. I'm pointing
[1:32:03.940 --> 1:32:10.420]  out the way forward things that I've discovered that I absolutely know work that if you will
[1:32:10.420 --> 1:32:15.980]  listen to me and try them out for yourself, you will see how amazing it is. And then your
[1:32:15.980 --> 1:32:22.660]  support of the product we're selling will help you and will help us. And it's symbiotic.
[1:32:22.660 --> 1:32:28.100]  My friends, I harp and harp and harp about iodine because it's the good halogen fluoride,
[1:32:28.100 --> 1:32:32.340]  the bad halogen. And people told me about it for years and I didn't listen. And I'm
[1:32:32.340 --> 1:32:38.180]  so thankful that finally I listened to Dr. Group like eight years ago and started taking
[1:32:38.180 --> 1:32:45.940]  true iodine, atomic iodine. We've got it back in stock X to 40% off right now at info or
[1:32:45.940 --> 1:32:51.720]  store dot com. And I'm telling you, folks, get it. It's amazing. Discover the benefits
[1:32:51.720 --> 1:32:59.540]  and it funds the info or a 360 win. You can't lose unless you don't take action.
[1:32:59.540 --> 1:33:25.500]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show Alex Jones here reporting from the road on the
[1:33:25.500 --> 1:33:31.620]  incredibly dangerous developments concerning the coronavirus. It has now infected hundreds
[1:33:31.620 --> 1:33:36.660]  and hundreds of thousands of people. It is now spread across the entire planet. And of
[1:33:36.660 --> 1:33:40.980]  course, we've now discovered that indeed it is manmade and engineered. We're covering
[1:33:40.980 --> 1:33:45.980]  it live all with our team at info wars dot com for its last show and band on video. On
[1:33:45.980 --> 1:33:52.460]  top of that, we have the patented nano silver that Congress A&M and Homeland Security have
[1:33:52.460 --> 1:33:58.140]  certified is able to take out the Corona family viruses, the SARS. That's what it comes out
[1:33:58.140 --> 1:34:03.420]  of. We have that at 40% off despite the fact it's selling out in three different sizes
[1:34:03.420 --> 1:34:08.740]  at info wars store dot com. And that's what I'm using. Well, my family is using as a
[1:34:08.740 --> 1:34:13.780]  frontline defense. Nothing's perfect, except you know, prayer and God's intervention. And
[1:34:13.780 --> 1:34:18.020]  we hope that this thing isn't as bad as it looks. But definitely we know why governments
[1:34:18.020 --> 1:34:23.940]  are panicking right now because this is certainly a bizarre virus. The demand for food has not
[1:34:23.940 --> 1:34:29.060]  let up. We are selling record amounts of it. Everybody else has basically already sold
[1:34:29.060 --> 1:34:34.860]  out or they have giant wait list. Our suppliers have it in house mistaken seven to 10 days
[1:34:34.860 --> 1:34:40.180]  to deliver because again, they have to package it. They're running 24 hours a day. But in
[1:34:40.180 --> 1:34:44.020]  a few days, they're telling me it may go to a longer wait if you haven't gotten your order
[1:34:44.020 --> 1:34:48.300]  in. So I wouldn't procrastinate. We wanted this virus to be peering out. We wanted to
[1:34:48.300 --> 1:34:53.380]  just be hype. Looks like it is really, really bad and is man made. And so that's why we're
[1:34:53.380 --> 1:34:58.700]  seeing the huge freak out. So get your storeable food at info wars store dot com. That helps
[1:34:58.700 --> 1:35:03.180]  fund our operation. It's insurance. You can eat a total 360 win. Again, get your food
[1:35:03.180 --> 1:35:08.100]  and actually get it delivered at info wars store dot com. Get your order in. It's locked
[1:35:08.100 --> 1:35:13.940]  in guaranteed seven to 10 days info wars store dot com. And regardless, it funds the operation
[1:35:13.940 --> 1:35:17.500]  and we also have the immune gargle at 40% off. We are going to sell out of that, but
[1:35:17.500 --> 1:35:25.420]  I'm just keeping it at that sales price info wars store dot com. Welcome back to the Alex
[1:35:25.420 --> 1:35:29.060]  Jones show. That was of course a very important message from Alex. And by the way, he's not
[1:35:29.060 --> 1:35:33.740]  kidding at national file dot com. We talked to the president of my patriot supply, which
[1:35:33.740 --> 1:35:39.540]  of course is info wars, one and only partner for storeable foods and the man sounded panicked.
[1:35:39.540 --> 1:35:44.420]  They are absolutely selling more product and faster than they ever have before in the company's
[1:35:44.420 --> 1:35:49.780]  decade plus long history. So now is a good time to go to info wars store dot com. Alex
[1:35:49.780 --> 1:35:55.380]  will be joining us in the next hour to go deep into what's happening with Corona virus,
[1:35:55.380 --> 1:35:59.420]  where it may have originated from. He's going to go deep into all of these facets, but I
[1:35:59.420 --> 1:36:05.260]  want to kind of show you what we're dealing with when it comes with communist China. Some
[1:36:05.260 --> 1:36:10.060]  folks, including Mike Adams on the Sunday broadcast of the Alex Jones show said that
[1:36:10.060 --> 1:36:15.900]  essentially China has a totalitarian mindset and that may work in their favor when it comes
[1:36:15.900 --> 1:36:19.700]  to this virus. They will be willing to do things that in the West we would never do.
[1:36:19.700 --> 1:36:26.340]  Our citizenry would never put up with it. They are, for example, quickly cremating victims
[1:36:26.340 --> 1:36:34.340]  who die of Corona virus without funerals. No funerals for those who died new trial and
[1:36:34.340 --> 1:36:39.380]  regulations from China's National Health Commission, NHC have banned funerals and other similar
[1:36:39.380 --> 1:36:44.420]  activities involving the corpses of the deceased victims of the novel Corona virus. The new
[1:36:44.420 --> 1:36:49.020]  regulations on the disposal of remains comes the NHC announced that the death toll has
[1:36:49.020 --> 1:36:54.340]  risen to simply 304. They're still saying 304. You know, maybe today it's gone up to
[1:36:54.340 --> 1:36:59.940]  315. I don't think anybody believes they're telling the truth. Chinese citizens who of
[1:36:59.940 --> 1:37:08.020]  course 60 million plus are now placed in a quarantine. They're not getting supplies.
[1:37:08.020 --> 1:37:12.340]  They're not getting what they need to survive. They're wearing feminine hygiene products,
[1:37:12.340 --> 1:37:19.060]  bras, fast food bags and fruit skins as makeshift masks. The Chinese certainly don't seem to
[1:37:19.060 --> 1:37:24.300]  be worried about this. But again, the government says they will be protected. So they think
[1:37:24.300 --> 1:37:30.020]  they're going to be protected. A national file. We had a video where a local Hong Kong
[1:37:30.020 --> 1:37:34.740]  news station went and interviewed people on the mainland and said, are you worried about
[1:37:34.740 --> 1:37:38.780]  the Corona virus? Are you going to wear a mask? Are you going to buy a mask? And they
[1:37:38.780 --> 1:37:44.140]  said, we have the government. No masks. We're fine. The government's here. They're going
[1:37:44.140 --> 1:37:47.980]  to help us. And you're watching this video and you're thinking is there someone with
[1:37:47.980 --> 1:37:52.580]  a gun off on the other side of the cameras? There's someone holding gun at them. But this
[1:37:52.580 --> 1:37:57.060]  is just what happens. And it's devastating. These people have suffered under communism
[1:37:57.060 --> 1:38:04.900]  for generations. And when you kill a giant chunk of a country's population, then another
[1:38:04.900 --> 1:38:10.100]  giant chunk simply starved to death because now the first thing he did was get rid of
[1:38:10.100 --> 1:38:14.940]  all the modern farm equipment. You're going to be left with a population that is very
[1:38:14.940 --> 1:38:20.140]  docile, that will do what the government says. And so then when the government comes out
[1:38:20.140 --> 1:38:26.700]  with something like this from the Daily Star, Chinese authorities threaten to kill pet cats
[1:38:26.700 --> 1:38:34.780]  and dogs over Corona virus fears. In a desperate attempt to stop the spread of coronavirus,
[1:38:34.780 --> 1:38:40.060]  some Chinese pet owners have been warned to deal with their cats and dogs or government
[1:38:40.060 --> 1:38:45.300]  officials could have them exterminated. Comes days after one of China's top infectious disease
[1:38:45.300 --> 1:38:49.500]  experts said the deadly virus could spread from animals to humans. Quote, if your dogs
[1:38:49.500 --> 1:38:55.540]  run around outside and come into contact with the outbreak or people infected with the virus,
[1:38:55.540 --> 1:39:00.940]  the near pet should be put in quarantine. That's Professor Lee Lan-Wan from China's
[1:39:00.940 --> 1:39:04.940]  National Health Commission. Because the epidemic spreads between mammals, therefore we should
[1:39:04.940 --> 1:39:12.180]  take precaution against other mammals. And again, these people and Alex Jones has talked
[1:39:12.180 --> 1:39:18.020]  about this as well. There were originally reports. Now it certainly doesn't seem to
[1:39:18.020 --> 1:39:24.140]  be the case. Now leave it at that. That this spread from bats, people were eating bat soup
[1:39:24.140 --> 1:39:29.180]  and you see the videos and you see what these people eat. You see, we have videos on National
[1:39:29.180 --> 1:39:40.300]  File of people eating live rodents, lunch with a side of tomato. This is what goes on in
[1:39:40.300 --> 1:39:44.820]  this part of the world. And we look at that and we see, I mean, you can see, TV viewers
[1:39:44.820 --> 1:39:50.100]  can see it on screen right now. It's disturbing. But we look at that and we see why the hell
[1:39:50.100 --> 1:39:53.220]  is this happening? Well, it's happening again because they've suffered under communism.
[1:39:53.220 --> 1:39:57.460]  They didn't have food for most of the last century. Only now are they starting to have
[1:39:57.460 --> 1:40:04.740]  food again. But people see that. People see where this virus originated from. And I'm
[1:40:04.740 --> 1:40:09.540]  sure there might be some anti-Chinese sentiment. But the fact is, we know we're being lied
[1:40:09.540 --> 1:40:13.780]  to by the Chinese government. Now it certainly seems we're being lied to by the United States
[1:40:13.780 --> 1:40:18.420]  government, by the mainstream media. Just think, compare the coronavirus to every other
[1:40:18.420 --> 1:40:27.540]  virus that's happened within my lifetime. Swine flu, SARS, the bird flu. The media could
[1:40:27.540 --> 1:40:31.620]  not stop hyping them up. The media could not stop telling you that it was going to be the
[1:40:31.620 --> 1:40:36.460]  end of days that all of China was going to die from the bird flu. Remember the bird flu?
[1:40:36.460 --> 1:40:40.620]  Remember swine flu? All these different little flu. SARS actually had the biggest impact.
[1:40:40.620 --> 1:40:45.580]  Well, now this is having a bigger impact than SARS. So what is the media doing? Well, they're
[1:40:45.580 --> 1:40:52.980]  focusing obsessively on J-Lo. They're focusing on the twerking that we saw last night at
[1:40:52.980 --> 1:40:59.740]  the Super Bowl. They're focusing on President Trump's impeachment. Will he or won't he
[1:40:59.740 --> 1:41:06.340]  be acquitted? They're focusing on, of course, today, the Iowa caucuses where Bernie Sanders
[1:41:06.340 --> 1:41:12.140]  looks like he might just walk away with a victory. They're focusing on everything but
[1:41:12.140 --> 1:41:19.660]  the massive, massive illness that has millions of people in quarantine in China. This is
[1:41:19.660 --> 1:41:23.580]  a country that cares about money more than it does its citizenry. Do you know how much
[1:41:23.580 --> 1:41:28.660]  money they're losing from 65 million plus people in quarantine? All these people dying.
[1:41:28.660 --> 1:41:33.740]  They wouldn't be doing this if it wasn't serious. But then the outward response is, you racist
[1:41:33.740 --> 1:41:41.700]  Westerners, how dare you be racist against the Chinese? And of course, this is from the
[1:41:41.700 --> 1:41:48.500]  Associated Press, South Korea, full of racism, the United States. This is just a nice little
[1:41:48.500 --> 1:41:55.020]  anecdote. It's terrible what's happened. I mean, I guess it is. But we're sitting here,
[1:41:55.020 --> 1:42:02.180]  you know, are we all going to be on our deathbeds, dying of coronavirus, unable to breathe, scarred
[1:42:02.180 --> 1:42:08.140]  lungs? And then are we just going to look up to the doctor and say, but at least I wasn't
[1:42:08.140 --> 1:42:15.820]  racist? It's bizarre. It's China, South Korea, the United States, Hong Kong, Europe, Australia,
[1:42:15.820 --> 1:42:21.020]  New Zealand, all of this racism happening. Racism is truly the greatest evil, the greatest
[1:42:21.020 --> 1:42:27.740]  threat to our civilization, not novel coronavirus. No, no, no, no, no. So again, I'm Tom Papert,
[1:42:27.740 --> 1:42:32.780]  the file.com editor in chief. You can read my work there. We're going to be joined in
[1:42:32.780 --> 1:42:38.820]  the next hour by Alex Jones, who is then going to take over. So do not go away. I'll be here
[1:42:38.820 --> 1:42:44.740]  for the bottom of this hour to wrap it up. We're going to get into a little bit bigger
[1:42:44.740 --> 1:42:49.100]  picture of what's happening in Asia because of coronavirus, because of course, China is
[1:42:49.100 --> 1:42:53.260]  the major power there. So it's really devastating stuff. Don't go away. You're watching the
[1:42:53.260 --> 1:43:01.780]  Alex Jones show. The demand for food has not let up. We are selling record amounts of it.
[1:43:01.780 --> 1:43:06.740]  Everybody else has basically already sold out, or they have giant wait list. Our suppliers
[1:43:06.740 --> 1:43:11.860]  have it in house, mistaken seven to 10 days to deliver, because again, they have to package
[1:43:11.860 --> 1:43:16.540]  it they're running 24 hours a day. But in a few days, they're telling me it may go to
[1:43:16.540 --> 1:43:20.340]  a longer wait if you haven't gotten your order again. So I wouldn't crash today. We wanted
[1:43:20.340 --> 1:43:24.980]  this virus to be peering out. We wanted to just be hype. Looks like it is really, really
[1:43:24.980 --> 1:43:30.020]  bad and is man made. And so that's why we're seeing the huge freak out. So get your storeable
[1:43:30.020 --> 1:43:34.500]  food at info wars of store.com. That helps find our operation. It's insurance. You can

[1:44:19.540 --> 1:44:26.420]  operations to trigger race war. Machines and bombings, which will be blamed on those loyal
[1:44:26.420 --> 1:44:33.540]  to America. Anyone wants to stage these attacks that does not blame it on Trump. We'll also
[1:44:33.540 --> 1:44:43.300]  be targeted by cobra in the future. You see, when you expose our false flags and fake media,
[1:44:43.300 --> 1:44:50.100]  I will carry out attacks and then blame you like we've done with Alex Jones blaming him
[1:44:50.100 --> 1:44:59.940]  for mass shootings. We committed. Hey, we've got three big sales going right now. And one
[1:44:59.940 --> 1:45:08.500]  of them has to end within a week. And that's ultimate fish oil for 33% off. It's amazing.

[1:46:53.860 --> 1:47:15.100]  I suggest you use it. You're listening to the Alex Jones show live from Austin, Texas broadcasting
[1:47:15.100 --> 1:47:24.660]  worldwide. It's Alex Jones. Welcome back to the Alex Jones show. I'm Tom Pappert editor
[1:47:24.660 --> 1:47:29.220]  and chief of national file dot com filling in for the rest of this hour. Then we will
[1:47:29.220 --> 1:47:34.460]  be joined by Alex Jones himself. So when we left off, I mentioned that I wanted to talk
[1:47:34.460 --> 1:47:39.380]  about what's happening nearby in Asia because that's really what's going to happen here.
[1:47:39.380 --> 1:47:43.540]  I mean, Mike Adams lays it all out very well. Natural news.com. He was on the Alex Jones
[1:47:43.540 --> 1:47:48.860]  show yesterday. I'm sure he will be back on soon to go into greater detail. But look,
[1:47:48.860 --> 1:47:54.180]  most of the world cannot deal with an outbreak like this cannot deal with a virus like this.
[1:47:54.180 --> 1:47:58.340]  If this goes to South America, if this goes to Mexico, it's going to come to the United
[1:47:58.340 --> 1:48:03.620]  States. If it comes to the United States, it's going to thrive in sanctuary cities in California
[1:48:03.620 --> 1:48:08.700]  where people are defecating in the street where people are passed out dead or alive on drugs
[1:48:08.700 --> 1:48:14.780]  on the street. That's going to be devastating. And so we relate to see what comes next for
[1:48:14.780 --> 1:48:19.100]  the United States. Should it get that far? And we can all hope and pray that it doesn't.
[1:48:19.100 --> 1:48:23.420]  But you need to prepare for the worst. We should see what happens, for example, in nearby Hong
[1:48:23.420 --> 1:48:29.900]  Kong. Hong Kong, of course, simply 7 million people compared to China's billions and billions
[1:48:29.900 --> 1:48:36.020]  of people. Hong Kong had the second largest number of deaths from SARS back when that
[1:48:36.020 --> 1:48:43.460]  was devastating the area. And right now people are already panic buying in Hong Kong amid
[1:48:43.460 --> 1:48:49.060]  the alarming spread of coronavirus report comes from Sky News. Almost everyone is wearing
[1:48:49.060 --> 1:48:54.220]  a surgical mask in the city. Some have even resorted to dawning respirator masks once used
[1:48:54.220 --> 1:48:59.220]  to counter the effects of police tear gas. Even Hong Kong's chief executive Carrie Lam
[1:48:59.220 --> 1:49:03.620]  wears a facial mask during her news conferences. And of course, this is Hong Kong, which has
[1:49:03.620 --> 1:49:08.620]  been in a reasonable, I think it's reasonable to say, in a conflict with the mainland China
[1:49:08.620 --> 1:49:14.340]  for quite some time now. Of course, Info Wars was there last year. You may remember Savannah
[1:49:14.340 --> 1:49:18.020]  Hernandez and some of the other crew members actually going to Hong Kong to talk to the
[1:49:18.020 --> 1:49:22.740]  people there. It's an astonishing turnaround given Ms. Lam wants to ban the wearing of
[1:49:22.740 --> 1:49:27.660]  masks during the pro democracy protests in the city because she viewed them as frustrating
[1:49:27.660 --> 1:49:34.420]  the identification of protesters. But a city once racked with weekly violent protests and
[1:49:34.420 --> 1:49:40.140]  firebombing. You notice this guy in news talks about the Chinese versus Hong Kong protests.
[1:49:40.140 --> 1:49:45.740]  The crowd that the firebombing is now facing another crisis and this one could unite the
[1:49:45.740 --> 1:49:50.660]  most diverging political views. The coronavirus is inside the city already having spilled over
[1:49:50.660 --> 1:49:56.180]  from the many boundary crossings and transport links Hong Kong has with mainland China. This
[1:49:56.180 --> 1:50:00.460]  is what one woman had to say. We just don't trust the government and we don't trust the
[1:50:00.460 --> 1:50:04.580]  mainlanders. It's a little bit different from what you hear from the few people who are
[1:50:04.580 --> 1:50:09.860]  allowed to talk to the media in mainland China. Quote, we think they will escape any quarantine
[1:50:09.860 --> 1:50:16.380]  and will go out in Hong Kong and spread their virus. Now, here's another article from the
[1:50:16.380 --> 1:50:21.340]  NPR. You see, it's starting to trickle out. They never tell you the full picture in mainstream
[1:50:21.340 --> 1:50:25.340]  news, but you can read it between the lines. You can get the subtext and you can figure
[1:50:25.340 --> 1:50:30.620]  out what's really happening. Coronavirus fears lead nurses to threaten strike in Hong Kong
[1:50:30.620 --> 1:50:38.620]  if borders aren't shut. And this one is really shocking when you get into it. Now, there's
[1:50:38.620 --> 1:50:44.360]  only been a couple of confirmed cases in Hong Kong and then they were put into a quarantine
[1:50:44.360 --> 1:50:49.660]  part of the hospital. But what they're doing there is they're breaking up the staff of
[1:50:49.660 --> 1:50:54.820]  these hospitals, the nurses, the doctors, everyone into two groups, the dirty group
[1:50:54.820 --> 1:50:59.580]  and the clean group. Now, the clean group is going to continue their job as if nothing
[1:50:59.580 --> 1:51:03.460]  were happening. The clean group is going to take care of people who have the flu, who
[1:51:03.460 --> 1:51:08.780]  break an arm, who have a heart attack, who need surgery. But the dirty group, well, they're
[1:51:08.780 --> 1:51:15.260]  going to deal exclusively with people who are suspected to have coronavirus. And they're
[1:51:15.260 --> 1:51:20.300]  not allowed to go home. They're not allowed to see their family. They cannot leave the
[1:51:20.300 --> 1:51:28.740]  hospital. They live. These doctors live in a state of quarantine and they are now threatening
[1:51:28.740 --> 1:51:36.660]  to go on strike unless the borders are completely shut. And Kerry Lam, the chief executive of
[1:51:36.660 --> 1:51:44.100]  Hong Kong, has already stopped rail crossings. They have taken some minor steps to end this
[1:51:44.100 --> 1:51:48.500]  open border policy. But now the doctors and nurses are saying they cannot continue doing
[1:51:48.500 --> 1:51:52.620]  their jobs and it's unrealistic. These hospitals, which already have 7 million people to deal
[1:51:52.620 --> 1:51:58.300]  with, are essentially working with a half staff because half the staff is trying to worry
[1:51:58.300 --> 1:52:02.340]  about coronavirus. The other half is trying to take care of 7 million people, many of
[1:52:02.340 --> 1:52:09.420]  whom just get sick on a daily basis. So one doctor, Dr. Albert Wong, says he won't be
[1:52:09.420 --> 1:52:14.940]  joining the picketers if a strike does occur, but he fully supports them and believes that
[1:52:14.940 --> 1:52:20.300]  the government is completely wrong. He's a cardiologist. He says that in a time of crisis
[1:52:20.300 --> 1:52:24.900]  like this, almost all the physicians act as general practitioners and are called on to
[1:52:24.900 --> 1:52:30.300]  treat whoever comes through the door. And I really like going into Hong Kong because
[1:52:30.300 --> 1:52:33.900]  you're never going to get the true picture out of China. They cannot possibly be telling
[1:52:33.900 --> 1:52:39.540]  us. There's been reports of mass graves, but they're supposedly only 300 people who died
[1:52:39.540 --> 1:52:44.180]  because of this. They're sickening videos where they're butchering, not even just butchering.
[1:52:44.180 --> 1:52:50.060]  They're pushing pigs and other livestock into giant mass graves using construction equipment
[1:52:50.060 --> 1:52:55.420]  to try to end the coronavirus. But it's okay. It's only 300 people who've died. I mean, it's
[1:52:55.420 --> 1:52:58.660]  totally bizarre. You're never going to get the truth out of China. But Hong Kong, which
[1:52:58.660 --> 1:53:03.300]  of course has a similar culture, very similar ethnic makeup, except they love freedom. They
[1:53:03.300 --> 1:53:08.420]  love democracy. They love nationalism and dislike globalism. You get a little bit more
[1:53:08.420 --> 1:53:13.300]  of an idea of what's going on. So Wong and other healthcare workers say Hong Kong had
[1:53:13.300 --> 1:53:17.740]  plenty of time to isolate themselves from China and to prevent this new virus from getting
[1:53:17.740 --> 1:53:21.780]  a foothold in the city. They argue that Hong Kong could have stopped the arrival of the
[1:53:21.780 --> 1:53:26.900]  illness by completely shutting its border with China. Wow, a government that controls
[1:53:26.900 --> 1:53:33.300]  its own borders. Isn't that something to behold? They could have completely shut their borders
[1:53:33.300 --> 1:53:37.140]  with China when the news of the virus first broke and by keeping it sealed until the outbreak
[1:53:37.140 --> 1:53:42.020]  on the mainland is under control. Quote, if you look at those confirmed cases so far that
[1:53:42.020 --> 1:53:47.580]  we are having in Hong Kong, all of them are imported cases. All of the patients are from
[1:53:47.580 --> 1:53:52.420]  Hubei province. That's where Wuhan is. And most of them arrived in Hong Kong by high
[1:53:52.420 --> 1:53:58.140]  speed train. If the government had listened to us, he continues. If they had closed down
[1:53:58.140 --> 1:54:05.060]  that high speed rail, if they closed down the borders, all of this could have been prevented.
[1:54:05.060 --> 1:54:08.660]  We have been advocating for this for weeks now. We have been advocating for this since
[1:54:08.660 --> 1:54:14.340]  early January. But they haven't done anything until last Thursday when they finally shut
[1:54:14.340 --> 1:54:18.180]  down some of the rail lines. Now imagine this in the United States. President Trump is doing
[1:54:18.180 --> 1:54:22.740]  everything he can to build that big, beautiful wall. But of course, it's being stymied over
[1:54:22.740 --> 1:54:25.940]  and over and over again. Anything they can do. They get a judge in Hawaii. They get a
[1:54:25.940 --> 1:54:30.060]  judge in the Ninth Circuit somewhere else in California to decide the entire country
[1:54:30.060 --> 1:54:33.260]  doesn't have the right to have a wall. It's just how it works in this country. You see
[1:54:33.260 --> 1:54:37.340]  these judges have more power than the president to the United States. Now, of course, President
[1:54:37.340 --> 1:54:41.380]  Trump, and the wall is going up. He says there's going to be over 500 miles of it done by the
[1:54:41.380 --> 1:54:45.780]  end of this year, just in time for his reelection, as it would turn out. But the wall is not
[1:54:45.780 --> 1:54:50.780]  yet complete. And of course, it's racist to have our military at the southern border for
[1:54:50.780 --> 1:54:55.060]  some God unknown reason. We know for a fact that a lot of these people, I think it's like
[1:54:55.060 --> 1:55:00.060]  two thirds of the people who come to the border with children, they're not their children.
[1:55:00.060 --> 1:55:05.140]  They are being trafficked or they're being bought. You go down south of the border and
[1:55:05.140 --> 1:55:09.140]  you say, Hey, let me use your kid to get into the United States. I'll pay 500 bucks. That's
[1:55:09.140 --> 1:55:15.700]  a whole budding operation down there now. The DNA test approved it. So we can't build
[1:55:15.700 --> 1:55:22.540]  the wall. Can't build it fast enough anyway. We have the Chinese, the Mexican military.
[1:55:22.540 --> 1:55:27.700]  They have actually become the wall down there. There have been violent clashes between the
[1:55:27.700 --> 1:55:32.380]  caravans and the Mexican military. That's the only thing keeping immigration. It's it's
[1:55:32.380 --> 1:55:36.060]  slowed down, but they're still getting through. And that's the only thing that's keeping it
[1:55:36.060 --> 1:55:40.620]  from being wave after wave of endless migration as it was during the Obama years in the first
[1:55:40.620 --> 1:55:44.660]  couple years of the Trump administration before we could get it under control. The only thing
[1:55:44.660 --> 1:55:49.140]  keeping it from turning into that is the Mexican military willing to fire weapons of people
[1:55:49.140 --> 1:55:55.300]  who try to get into the United States illegally because Trump hasn't by the short and curlies.
[1:55:55.300 --> 1:56:00.580]  So if this spreads to Central America, some of these very poor countries where they can't
[1:56:00.580 --> 1:56:06.180]  even face off with the drug cartels, where they can't even get the corruption out of
[1:56:06.180 --> 1:56:09.780]  their own government, they can't handle their own borders, they have millions of people
[1:56:09.780 --> 1:56:13.700]  fleeing their country to go north and live in the United States where they think they're
[1:56:13.700 --> 1:56:17.980]  going to get free health care, free car insurance, free cars, free food, free everything. And
[1:56:17.980 --> 1:56:21.380]  you know, they end up getting most of that. They get a they get a credit card or a debit
[1:56:21.380 --> 1:56:25.460]  card loaded with cash so they can get whatever they want. Once they get here, they get a
[1:56:25.460 --> 1:56:28.380]  court date that they don't have to go to. They get to do whatever the hell they want
[1:56:28.380 --> 1:56:32.620]  once they make it into the United States. These countries cannot keep tabs on their
[1:56:32.620 --> 1:56:36.940]  own people. They cannot keep their own people safe. They cannot keep the cartels from running
[1:56:36.940 --> 1:56:42.500]  their governments. If the coronavirus breaks out in Central America, there will be wave
[1:56:42.500 --> 1:56:49.860]  after wave of endless migration toward the United States, Mexico border. The border hawks
[1:56:49.860 --> 1:56:55.020]  in this country who have been calling for the border to be closed for decades now will
[1:56:55.020 --> 1:57:00.860]  be proven right just as in Hong Kong. And the sick people, many of whom will be asymptomatic
[1:57:00.860 --> 1:57:06.700]  for a week plus who are fleeing to the United States who who the Democrats will read that
[1:57:06.700 --> 1:57:10.940]  Statue of Liberty poem and they'll let them in because it's just the right thing to do.
[1:57:10.940 --> 1:57:15.500]  And they'll go straight to sanctuary cities where it will spread likely among the homeless
[1:57:15.500 --> 1:57:21.140]  population. We're looking at a terrible, terrible situation here, folks. That's the picture.
[1:57:21.140 --> 1:57:25.780]  That's what Hong Kong tells us. That's where we're at. When we're back in the next hour,
[1:57:25.780 --> 1:57:30.580]  we will be joined by Alex Jones. He's going to dive deep into the latest information.

[2:00:14.940 --> 2:00:23.100]  and do nothing. If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance. We now take you live
[2:00:23.100 --> 2:00:31.220]  to the central Texas command center. It's Alex Jones. Alex will be joining us very,
[2:00:31.220 --> 2:00:35.380]  very shortly is of course out of town on a very important mission. He's always doing
[2:00:35.380 --> 2:00:39.700]  this. He cannot get away. He loves this job too much. And you know what it really comes
[2:00:39.700 --> 2:00:46.860]  down to is this is huge. Coronavirus is massive. You have these Facebook fact checkers. I have
[2:00:46.860 --> 2:00:51.340]  kind of a vendetta against these people if you can't tell. And they say these fact checkers,
[2:00:51.340 --> 2:00:54.660]  they claim to know more than Mike Adams. They claim to know more than the CDC. They claim
[2:00:54.660 --> 2:00:58.620]  to know more than these Hong Kong doctors who are begging for the borders to be shut.
[2:00:58.620 --> 2:01:05.020]  They claim to know everything because they used to work at CNN, don't you know? And so
[2:01:05.020 --> 2:01:11.660]  that's the biggest red flag with all of this. That if you're trying to talk about coronavirus
[2:01:11.660 --> 2:01:18.420]  online, and you don't just parrot the official narrative, if you try to go on Facebook and
[2:01:18.420 --> 2:01:21.620]  share this broadcast, don't even try it, folks. You'll get banned. I broke that news two years
[2:01:21.620 --> 2:01:27.700]  ago. You will be banned. You will be banned for spreading conspiracy theories, otherwise
[2:01:27.700 --> 2:01:34.700]  known as basic facts that you can read in international newspapers and in NPR. On Twitter,
[2:01:34.700 --> 2:01:41.220]  of course, we saw zero hedge totally taken out because they had the audacity to say,
[2:01:41.220 --> 2:01:45.900]  hey, wait a minute, this seems like it might be worthy of reporting. And then a BuzzFeed
[2:01:45.900 --> 2:01:52.620]  journalist reached out to Twitter and got zero hedge taken off the platform. This same
[2:01:52.620 --> 2:01:56.740]  BuzzFeed journalist, by the way, creepy, creepy dude. These are the people who are running
[2:01:56.740 --> 2:02:00.060]  interference for the Chinese government. You can find this. We're still working on our
[2:02:00.060 --> 2:02:04.740]  article at national file.com. But yeah, I mean, I got to give props where it's to zero hedge
[2:02:04.740 --> 2:02:09.780]  has the article and the BuzzFeed journalist who got them banned for daring to ask questions
[2:02:09.780 --> 2:02:16.260]  about coronavirus. This guy is one sick puppy. We'll just leave it at that. He's made dozens
[2:02:16.260 --> 2:02:23.700]  of posts throughout the years. He has a Tumblr blog, and he seems very, very interested in
[2:02:23.700 --> 2:02:29.740]  young boys. Now, of course, I'm sure he claims it's all humor. It's funny to talk about
[2:02:29.740 --> 2:02:35.900]  raping children, according to these people. But he's got photos of young prepubescent
[2:02:35.900 --> 2:02:45.740]  boys or I guess 13 to 14 year old boys, where he says that it, it arouses him. He has doxed
[2:02:45.740 --> 2:02:50.620]  people in the past a random bakery can see it on screen TV viewers, radio listeners that
[2:02:50.620 --> 2:02:56.940]  says someone put together a pastime of contact info for a bakery. There you can see TV viewers,
[2:02:56.940 --> 2:03:03.620]  the young boy, it looks like a Justin Bieber impersonator. This is the guy at BuzzFeed.
[2:03:03.620 --> 2:03:08.900]  This is the guy at BuzzFeed who decides whether you get to talk. There it is. Here's what
[2:03:08.900 --> 2:03:13.220]  this guy says, this BuzzFeed journalist. And again, he's going to say he's joking. At what
[2:03:13.220 --> 2:03:17.180]  age can you become a pedophile? Like at what age do you switch from being a statutory rapist
[2:03:17.180 --> 2:03:23.300]  and start being a sexual predator? Oh, it's so hilarious. It's just a joke. He's a comedian.
[2:03:23.300 --> 2:03:26.500]  You remember when James Gunn did all of this? Well, now he's got his job back. So I don't
[2:03:26.500 --> 2:03:29.900]  even think BuzzFeed is going to fire this guy. I think they know exactly who they work
[2:03:29.900 --> 2:03:37.740]  with and they don't care. But this guy who is joking about molesting children who dox
[2:03:37.740 --> 2:03:44.540]  his people. He's the guy who gets zero hedge band from Twitter. They had almost a million
[2:03:44.540 --> 2:03:49.660]  people following their Twitter account. And now it's been terminated because BuzzFeed,
[2:03:49.660 --> 2:03:59.280]  the arbiter of truth, the people who brought you the PP dossier, they decided that zero
[2:03:59.280 --> 2:04:05.100]  hedge can no longer exist. It's a zany world. And I mean, I certainly hope, and I think
[2:04:05.100 --> 2:04:09.060]  Alex has reiterated this, but we all hope, I'm sure the viewers, I'm sure the crew, everybody
[2:04:09.060 --> 2:04:12.660]  out there and their dog is hoping that this thing is going to blow over. It's going to
[2:04:12.660 --> 2:04:16.060]  fizzle out. They were going to have five cases in the United States and that's going to be
[2:04:16.060 --> 2:04:20.740]  all she wrote. But on the off chance, that's not what happens. It's going to be people
[2:04:20.740 --> 2:04:26.560]  like this little Cretan at BuzzFeed who wind up making it worse because he's not allowing
[2:04:26.560 --> 2:04:31.180]  people to become informed. It's more important to censor people and protect the Chinese Communist
[2:04:31.180 --> 2:04:35.020]  government than it is to talk about what's actually happening on the planet. I'm Tom
[2:04:35.020 --> 2:04:39.460]  Pappard. Alex Jones will be joining us very, very shortly. You are watching the Alex Jones
[2:04:39.460 --> 2:04:44.660]  show. You can of course read my work at national file.com. Make sure to check newswors.com,
[2:04:44.660 --> 2:04:50.300]  infowors.com, band.video for the latest information that BuzzFeed doesn't want you to have. We'll
[2:04:50.300 --> 2:05:16.860]  be right back on the other side of this short break.
[2:05:16.860 --> 2:05:21.900]  Yes, now we know we're right. The new world order is real. Satanism is real. The pedophile
[2:05:21.900 --> 2:05:26.020]  a leader real. But we're real as well and we love God and we're standing up and saying
[2:05:26.020 --> 2:05:30.420]  no. But I just want to make the point here one month into 2020 that we have never been
[2:05:30.420 --> 2:05:35.540]  in Kansas. We have never been in some small, little place that didn't matter. Everything
[2:05:35.540 --> 2:05:40.380]  we do, every decision we make governs the future of our species and everything we've
[2:05:40.380 --> 2:05:42.780]  gone through and everything we're going to go through. So it's an incredible town to
[2:05:42.780 --> 2:05:47.220]  be alive. I'm going to thank you all for being aware and being involved. But just remember
[2:05:47.220 --> 2:05:53.380]  your action now via prayer, word of mouth and financial support of mbourser.com is critical.
[2:05:53.380 --> 2:06:18.300]  Please take action. Welcome back to the Alex Jones show. The information that the fact
[2:06:18.300 --> 2:06:24.260]  checkers the buzzfeed that the Chinese communist government does not want you to receive. We're
[2:06:24.260 --> 2:06:28.580]  going to be joined very shortly by Alex Jones. But this is an article and it's already a
[2:06:28.580 --> 2:06:32.980]  day old. I mean, this stuff moves so fast, but this is still absolutely breaking. I guess
[2:06:32.980 --> 2:06:36.740]  Buzzfeed, I guess these fact checkers, I guess the chai com government is now going to have
[2:06:36.740 --> 2:06:45.060]  to go after Senator Tom Cotton, who has discussed links between the novel coronavirus to Chinese
[2:06:45.060 --> 2:06:52.100]  super laboratory that handles quote deadly pathogens. This is available at naturalnews.com.
[2:06:52.100 --> 2:06:55.900]  And this this article is so critical because I mean, what are they going to do? This is
[2:06:55.900 --> 2:06:58.860]  the information that you need to have to keep your family safe to understand what's going
[2:06:58.860 --> 2:07:03.740]  on in this world. I mean, this is a very serious situation. This is bigger than SARS. This
[2:07:03.740 --> 2:07:07.100]  is bigger than swine flu. All of these things that the media hyped up. This is bigger than
[2:07:07.100 --> 2:07:10.860]  all of them. Senator Tom Cotton is telling the truth about him. So I guess therefore
[2:07:10.860 --> 2:07:14.860]  we need to take his Twitter down to I guess we need to ban him from the internet being
[2:07:14.860 --> 2:07:22.100]  that he's spreading hate facts. This is naturalnews.com. According to the communist Chinese government,
[2:07:22.100 --> 2:07:26.960]  novel coronavirus is spreading because of bats, rats and snakes. But Senator Tom Cotton
[2:07:26.960 --> 2:07:31.980]  of Arkansas vehemently disagrees. In a recent statement, Senator Cotton discussed a new study
[2:07:31.980 --> 2:07:36.020]  published in The Lancet showing 14 of the original 40 people who developed coronavirus
[2:07:36.020 --> 2:07:42.540]  in Wuhan had never even stepped foot in the Huanan seafood wholesale markets where the
[2:07:42.540 --> 2:07:47.100]  virus is said to have originated. That's of course where there's the live snakes being
[2:07:47.100 --> 2:07:53.820]  eaten, the live bats, the live creatures, disturbing imagery. I mean, you have to understand
[2:07:53.820 --> 2:07:57.100]  these people who have done their communism. As we said earlier, they live under communism.
[2:07:57.100 --> 2:08:00.060]  They're going to eat whatever they can when there's no crops in the fields because you're
[2:08:00.060 --> 2:08:05.980]  not allowed to use farm equipment. You have to use a horse and a plow. As one epidemiologist
[2:08:05.980 --> 2:08:11.780]  said, quote, that virus went into the seafood market before it came out of the seafood market.
[2:08:11.780 --> 2:08:15.900]  Senator Cotton is quoted as saying, pointing out the fact that China is suddenly changing
[2:08:15.900 --> 2:08:22.620]  its story now that the truth is being revealed. Well, nobody can yet say with or with absolute
[2:08:22.620 --> 2:08:28.180]  certainty where the novel coronavirus originated. Senator Cotton pointed out that Wuhan has,
[2:08:28.180 --> 2:08:33.020]  quote, China's only biosafety level four super laboratory that works with the world's most
[2:08:33.020 --> 2:08:39.540]  deadly pathogens to include. Yes, coronavirus. It's also where it's the landmark city, the
[2:08:39.540 --> 2:08:45.300]  only one in the world where they've really rolled out 5G at its greatest potential. And
[2:08:45.300 --> 2:08:49.380]  of course, being a journalist, I had to watch the Super Bowl mostly for so I could see the
[2:08:49.380 --> 2:08:53.860]  disturbing halftime show which had demonic imagery like I've never seen in a halftime
[2:08:53.860 --> 2:08:58.660]  show before. I mean, it was something else. But the number of commercials for 5G were
[2:08:58.660 --> 2:09:02.420]  absolutely hilarious. I will just say that. I mean, nobody wants to talk about what's
[2:09:02.420 --> 2:09:05.900]  actually happening with 5G. They just want to say that it's safe and it's going to mean
[2:09:05.900 --> 2:09:11.020]  the fastest internet we've ever had. Because that's what we really need. We need to watch.
[2:09:11.020 --> 2:09:13.380]  I mean, you're not even going to notice a difference. That's what's so bizarre about
[2:09:13.380 --> 2:09:17.860]  this. The average internet user who watches the Alex Jones show on Bandai video, who watches
[2:09:17.860 --> 2:09:22.860]  Netflix, who checks their email, who messages people on Facebook, they're not going to notice
[2:09:22.860 --> 2:09:28.940]  any benefits from 5G. But Wuhan, China, who by province is, of course, the first place
[2:09:28.940 --> 2:09:33.620]  to have this epic 5G. It's the future. And of course, Trump just thinks it's the future.
[2:09:33.620 --> 2:09:39.940]  He doesn't know the truth. I hope. This lab, the article goes on, is known as the Wuhan
[2:09:39.940 --> 2:09:45.300]  Institute of Virology. And it just so happens to be China's only lab that's capable of working
[2:09:45.300 --> 2:09:51.140]  with this level of deadly pathogen, which suggests the novel coronavirus could have perhaps
[2:09:51.140 --> 2:09:56.220]  somehow escaped from it. Notes, natural news, Mike Adams. Earlier this week, Senator Cotton
[2:09:56.220 --> 2:10:01.260]  publicly called for a ban on all travel to and from China, quote, given the latest developments
[2:10:01.260 --> 2:10:05.300]  and the many unknowns about the virus. Now, President Trump has kind of done this. People
[2:10:05.300 --> 2:10:08.420]  who have been in China are not allowed to come to the United States. Any American citizens
[2:10:08.420 --> 2:10:12.660]  who are in China are going to have to self quarantine for 14 days. You do also have to
[2:10:12.660 --> 2:10:17.660]  wonder about the efficacy of self quarantine. That's not what they're doing in the United
[2:10:17.660 --> 2:10:22.820]  Kingdom to people who have come from China. They are locking them down. And they did do
[2:10:22.820 --> 2:10:26.540]  that with a group of people who came to the United States. They're locking them down.
[2:10:26.540 --> 2:10:30.860]  But it seems if you're just a tourist, if you were going to China to see family or to
[2:10:30.860 --> 2:10:36.460]  see the great wall of China, you may not be locked down. Earlier this week, Senator Cotton
[2:10:36.460 --> 2:10:41.460]  publicly called for the ban, quote, we ought to follow Benjamin Franklin's maxim. An ounce
[2:10:41.460 --> 2:10:47.300]  of prevention is worth a pound of cure. Senator Cotton wrote in a letter to the Trump administration.
[2:10:47.300 --> 2:10:52.580]  The senator also told Americans who are still in China to get out while they still can.
[2:10:52.580 --> 2:10:56.020]  In lieu of an actual decree from Washington, Senator Cotton is urging all Americans who
[2:10:56.020 --> 2:11:04.460]  are still in China to leave the country while they're still able to do so. And again, this
[2:11:04.460 --> 2:11:09.100]  is going to be called racist. We went over the story from the AP News here. I've got it
[2:11:09.100 --> 2:11:14.060]  in front of me. I mean, you're a racist if you're concerned about coronavirus. They talk
[2:11:14.060 --> 2:11:20.460]  about what these examples of racism are. And it's like a college classroom in Arizona and
[2:11:20.460 --> 2:11:25.540]  or a lunch at the cafeteria at a college in Arizona. And a Chinese student is sitting
[2:11:25.540 --> 2:11:30.220]  with her friends and they get up and leave. Well, surely that must be racism against Chinese
[2:11:30.220 --> 2:11:36.260]  people. That's the only possible solution. That's that's racism. Meanwhile, I mean, maybe
[2:11:36.260 --> 2:11:41.100]  I don't know. Maybe it is racism. Maybe America is this horrible racist place. The Democrats
[2:11:41.100 --> 2:11:46.900]  keep telling me it is. But you know, maybe if people had some information to go on, maybe
[2:11:46.900 --> 2:11:52.620]  if people knew the facts about coronavirus that for some reason you cannot get in the
[2:11:52.620 --> 2:11:56.420]  mainstream news, you can't even get it on social media and then get redirected to the
[2:11:56.420 --> 2:11:59.980]  real news. You have to come to this show. You have to watch the Alex Jones show. You
[2:11:59.980 --> 2:12:06.020]  have to seek it out. You have to go to news wars dot com to info wars dot com to natural
[2:12:06.020 --> 2:12:12.220]  news dot com to band dot video to national file. You know, the biggest antidote to these
[2:12:12.220 --> 2:12:18.260]  supposed racists who are running rampant on the streets of the United States is the truth.
[2:12:18.260 --> 2:12:23.220]  And the truth is, seems to be, this isn't going to be limited to Chinese people from
[2:12:23.220 --> 2:12:29.900]  Wuhan, China. There's, of course, TV viewers can see Senator Cotton's tweet message to all
[2:12:29.900 --> 2:12:41.100]  Americans in China. Get out now. Contact our embassy or consulates if you need help. But
[2:12:41.100 --> 2:12:46.340]  of course, I'm sure he's just a racist. The U. S. State Department is now being reported
[2:12:46.340 --> 2:12:50.580]  has already confirmed that a second chartered flight back to America will soon commence
[2:12:50.580 --> 2:12:55.460]  to evacuate American citizens who live around the area of Wuhan, which is under a mandatory
[2:12:55.460 --> 2:13:00.700]  quarantine. Senator Cotton also contends that China is lying about the number of people
[2:13:00.700 --> 2:13:06.260]  infected with and dying from coronavirus. In addition to not trusting the official story
[2:13:06.260 --> 2:13:10.460]  coming from the Chinese government about the true origin of novel coronavirus, Senator
[2:13:10.460 --> 2:13:14.620]  Cotton is suspicious about the official numbers, which he believes are far too low. Quote, there's
[2:13:14.620 --> 2:13:20.340]  a 28% increase in coronavirus cases overnight in China. Senator Cotton tweeted, make no mistake,
[2:13:20.340 --> 2:13:25.660]  though. These aren't new cases. Just what China is willing to admit. It's much worse.
[2:13:25.660 --> 2:13:30.180]  And Senator Cotton's view, China just needs to be dealt harsh consequences for all of
[2:13:30.180 --> 2:13:34.180]  its deception surrounding this global health emergency. But remember, I mean, the guy,
[2:13:34.180 --> 2:13:40.500]  this is going to be called very, very racist because it's racist to doubt what China says.
[2:13:40.500 --> 2:13:46.260]  It's racist not to just go with what the chai comms say point blank. And this is almost
[2:13:46.260 --> 2:13:51.300]  like the perfect storm because these big tech companies have been running interference for
[2:13:51.300 --> 2:13:55.340]  China. And well, since they banned Alex Jones and even before that, but it really else,
[2:13:55.340 --> 2:14:03.460]  it came to be so evident in 2018 when Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, all the big guys linked
[2:14:03.460 --> 2:14:06.920]  in. I don't know why Alex even would need a LinkedIn. They all banned Alex Jones and
[2:14:06.920 --> 2:14:09.860]  everybody looks at this and they say, well, why on earth would you do such a thing? And
[2:14:09.860 --> 2:14:13.020]  then you do the connections and you put it all together and you realize every single one
[2:14:13.020 --> 2:14:17.900]  of these countries either is essentially stayed owned by China because they are present in
[2:14:17.900 --> 2:14:24.940]  China or they want to be. Facebook, of course, tried to move to China, didn't work out. You're
[2:14:24.940 --> 2:14:29.260]  still trying to reach a deal. And so then that explains why Alex Jones is banned. Well,
[2:14:29.260 --> 2:14:33.980]  now how come, I mean, I'm surprised it's brave of what Senator Cotton is saying here. It's
[2:14:33.980 --> 2:14:38.860]  brave of him to try to get the truth out to the American people. Obviously, he is looking
[2:14:38.860 --> 2:14:42.460]  at the real information. He may not be watching the Alex Jones show, but he is reading what
[2:14:42.460 --> 2:14:47.220]  Alex reads, what I read, what all of the hosts here at Infowars. He's reading the same documents.
[2:14:47.220 --> 2:14:52.460]  He's getting the same information and he's not sitting on it. But for the average person,
[2:14:52.460 --> 2:14:56.140]  I mean, they're going to be shut down by social media because social media wants China to
[2:14:56.140 --> 2:15:01.380]  make it through this thing. They want China to have its reputation intact. And meanwhile,
[2:15:01.380 --> 2:15:05.060]  this is a country that lies about everything. I mean, it was like the first Friday that
[2:15:05.060 --> 2:15:09.500]  everybody was talking about coronavirus. The Chinese government from its official party
[2:15:09.500 --> 2:15:16.380]  newspaper released a statement saying, we cured it. It solved the world is saved. Glorious
[2:15:16.380 --> 2:15:23.020]  leader President Xi Jinping has saved the world. And now, of course, we know that wasn't
[2:15:23.020 --> 2:15:27.460]  true. In fact, the guy actually came out two days later and said it's a very big problem.
[2:15:27.460 --> 2:15:34.420]  China has millions of peaceful Muslims in concentration camps. China is killing people
[2:15:34.420 --> 2:15:38.620]  left and right. They're saying they're going to cremate the bodies. Why do you need to
[2:15:38.620 --> 2:15:43.900]  cremate 300 people? It doesn't make sense. But of course, they're lying about everything.
[2:15:43.900 --> 2:15:47.460]  Senator Cotton is totally right. We'll be joined by Alex Jones, hopefully in this next
[2:15:47.460 --> 2:15:54.300]  segment as soon as we can get his signal stabilized. I'm Tom Pamper. Don't go away.

[2:17:49.740 --> 2:17:55.020]  purchasing not an offer to buy or sell the security which requires an operating document.
[2:17:55.020 --> 2:17:59.980]  It was about a week and a half ago that my father came rushing into my office in the
[2:17:59.980 --> 2:18:05.220]  morning and said, son, you've got to see this. The company that holds the patents on the
[2:18:05.220 --> 2:18:09.020]  nano silver that's in our toothpaste that's in our immune gargle and that's in some of
[2:18:09.020 --> 2:18:15.700]  the other great products like the super silver wound shell had reports from back in 2007
[2:18:15.700 --> 2:18:20.540]  that the Pentagon working with A&M and Homeland Security with the director of Homeland Security

[2:20:07.820 --> 2:20:37.740]  Welcome back. You're watching the Alex Jones show. I'm Tom Pappard, editor in chief national
[2:20:37.740 --> 2:20:42.820]  file.com. As soon as we get Alex's signal stabilized, he will be joining us here remotely
[2:20:42.820 --> 2:20:48.300]  on the Alex Jones show. But of course, we're hitting coronavirus hard. Alex is going to
[2:20:48.300 --> 2:20:53.820]  be on with more crucial information very, very soon. But let's turn and see what's happening
[2:20:53.820 --> 2:20:59.700]  here in the United States within for just just for grins, the Democrat party where there
[2:20:59.700 --> 2:21:05.700]  is a massive conflict brewing. They're going to do it again. Everybody remembers 2016 where
[2:21:05.700 --> 2:21:13.180]  it became apparent pretty early on in the Democrat primaries and caucuses that it didn't matter
[2:21:13.180 --> 2:21:19.700]  how many delegates, how many votes Bernie Sanders got because the Democrat party, they
[2:21:19.700 --> 2:21:23.780]  have these things called super delegates. I know it's like a blast from the past. What's
[2:21:23.780 --> 2:21:29.340]  old is new, at least for the Democrat party because they did some rules to somewhat limit
[2:21:29.340 --> 2:21:35.900]  the power of these super delegates. These super delegates generally are very wealthy donors
[2:21:35.900 --> 2:21:41.500]  who are friends of the party infrastructure, probably in many cases, close friends of Bill
[2:21:41.500 --> 2:21:47.780]  and Hillary Clinton. So these super delegates, they're not tied to votes. Bernie could get
[2:21:47.780 --> 2:21:52.380]  60% of the vote, but if the majority of super delegates want to vote for, we'll say Biden
[2:21:52.380 --> 2:21:57.300]  this time around, maybe with Hillary as his VP could happen, maybe mini Mike Bloomberg
[2:21:57.300 --> 2:22:04.180]  with Hillary as the VP could definitely happen on the super delegates can make that happen.
[2:22:04.180 --> 2:22:09.540]  We're already looking at what could be a brokered convention because the DNC is trying to hurt
[2:22:09.540 --> 2:22:12.980]  Bernie Sanders again. In fact, they're trying to throw out their old super delegate, their
[2:22:12.980 --> 2:22:18.220]  new super delegate rules and revert to the old rules so the party can pick the nominee
[2:22:18.220 --> 2:22:24.260]  and invalidate the votes of the Democrat voters. And Bernie is of course a communist. I mean,
[2:22:24.260 --> 2:22:29.900]  he went to the Soviet Union and he comes back and he praises it vociferously. And over
[2:22:29.900 --> 2:22:35.220]  the last few years, he's been trying to ingratiate himself with the mainline Democrat party,
[2:22:35.220 --> 2:22:39.180]  which he has to be fair. I mean, Bernie has dragged these people further and further to
[2:22:39.180 --> 2:22:43.500]  socialism or democratic socialism that he calls. By the way, that whole democratic socialism
[2:22:43.500 --> 2:22:47.220]  thing, that's, that's a new invention. Bernie never used that term to my knowledge before
[2:22:47.220 --> 2:22:52.860]  like 2015. You can go find old speeches, old books, old writings, old letters that Bernie
[2:22:52.860 --> 2:22:56.820]  Sanders wrote where he just called himself a socialist, but he finally got some PR guy
[2:22:56.820 --> 2:23:00.100]  to get all of them and they told him to put the word democratic in front of it. And so
[2:23:00.100 --> 2:23:04.820]  it's okay. But now Bernie, again, he's been trying to play nice with these people. He's
[2:23:04.820 --> 2:23:10.460]  been trying to be nice to the Hillary Clinton staff DNC. It's all packed with former Hillary
[2:23:10.460 --> 2:23:20.620]  people and it's not working out. And even though Bernie is refusing to play rough, it
[2:23:20.620 --> 2:23:28.540]  certainly sounds like his more vocal supporters are including Queen Rashida Tlaib. We're going
[2:23:28.540 --> 2:23:32.820]  to impeach this bleeper. I'll just leave it at that. We all remember that. That went viral.
[2:23:32.820 --> 2:23:36.980]  That was when she was put into office. Then Nancy Pelosi has the audacity to say, you don't
[2:23:36.980 --> 2:23:42.660]  come to Congress to impeach president. Now that's, that's why squad member Rashida Tlaib
[2:23:42.660 --> 2:23:47.740]  was put into office. So even though Bernie's trying to play nice, there is a massive, massive
[2:23:47.740 --> 2:23:52.780]  divide happening. He's not going to be a good sheepdog this time around. I don't think let's
[2:23:52.780 --> 2:23:58.740]  air the clip of Queen Rashida Tlaib expressing her distaste with Hillary Clinton.
[2:23:58.740 --> 2:24:07.460]  You all know I can't be quiet. No, we're going to boo. That's all right. The haters, the
[2:24:07.460 --> 2:24:14.500]  haters will shut up on Monday when we win. There we go. And so of course today is the
[2:24:14.500 --> 2:24:18.940]  big day. And by the way, at national final dot com, we're uploading a series. We just
[2:24:18.940 --> 2:24:23.620]  got it completed here recently. We're going to be uploading a series of articles about
[2:24:23.620 --> 2:24:30.820]  what happened to Bernie in 2016. How a essentially what seems to be a Hillary Clinton operative
[2:24:30.820 --> 2:24:36.820]  ran to MSNBC and Buzzfeed and all the usual suspects and told them that Bernie's campaign
[2:24:36.820 --> 2:24:45.420]  had been infiltrated by the Kremlin and that Russian and Albanian bots were trying to divide
[2:24:45.420 --> 2:24:51.460]  the Bernie camp and turn them against the beautiful Hillary Clinton. So we're going
[2:24:51.460 --> 2:24:57.020]  to be exposing all of this as it comes down to crunch time here on Monday, where Bernie
[2:24:57.020 --> 2:25:06.740]  Sanders looks to be the favorite to win Iowa and Rashida Tlaib is booing and Hillary Clinton
[2:25:06.740 --> 2:25:12.500]  is waiting in the wings. They've stacked the DNC with all of her people. I think we're
[2:25:12.500 --> 2:25:16.740]  going to have a repeat of 2016. And the thing about Bernie is, I mean, I do respect, I don't
[2:25:16.740 --> 2:25:20.420]  respect Bernie. I think he is a communist. I think he's a dirtbag. I think he's a cretin.
[2:25:20.420 --> 2:25:25.500]  But Roger Stone said it right here on the Alex Jones show back in 2016. And it looks
[2:25:25.500 --> 2:25:30.140]  like he was completely right. He said that if we are nice to the Bernie people, not to
[2:25:30.140 --> 2:25:35.740]  Bernie to the Bernie people, a lot of them, I mean, they're misinformed. A lot of them
[2:25:35.740 --> 2:25:38.820]  are now Trump supporters. A lot of them are now at least populist if they can't support
[2:25:38.820 --> 2:25:42.780]  Trump. And you talk to these people and they think Bernie is an outsider. They think he
[2:25:42.780 --> 2:25:48.620]  is anti establishment. They think he is anti Federal Reserve. They think he is essentially
[2:25:48.620 --> 2:25:53.460]  Trump, but a leftist. Now, of course, we all know that's not the case. I mean, the guy
[2:25:53.460 --> 2:25:58.820]  is as he's been in Congress his entire life. He's never had a real job. He's been doing
[2:25:58.820 --> 2:26:05.220]  this. He's been with the crazy hair and the gesticulation his entire life. He is a dirtbag.
[2:26:05.220 --> 2:26:10.060]  In fact, we had national file. We put out a stunning report by Patrick Alley that showed
[2:26:10.060 --> 2:26:16.540]  Bernie Sanders might be funneling money to his wife and her friends. And that might be
[2:26:16.540 --> 2:26:23.620]  the whole reason he runs for president. He's got this ad agency where all of the advertising
[2:26:23.620 --> 2:26:27.980]  for his campaign goes through this ad agency that just happens to be created. His wife
[2:26:27.980 --> 2:26:31.860]  used to be on it, but now it's just his wife's close friends. And we're talking like millions
[2:26:31.860 --> 2:26:38.300]  of dollars have been funneled through this ad network, this ad company. So Bernie is
[2:26:38.300 --> 2:26:43.940]  by no means a good guy, but Bernie supporters, they might just be all right. And this is
[2:26:43.940 --> 2:26:49.420]  a rare moment where I'm going to celebrate Rashida's laib. Congresswoman impeach the
[2:26:49.420 --> 2:26:58.060]  blinker because the bigger the wedge we can drive between Bernie Sanders, perhaps gullible,
[2:26:58.060 --> 2:27:02.780]  perhaps under informed, but well intentioned supporters, the bigger and I don't mean the
[2:27:02.780 --> 2:27:07.500]  Kyle Jurex of the world who want to put you and me viewers and listeners in concentration
[2:27:07.500 --> 2:27:11.300]  camps. I mean the rank and file. I mean your granddad who thinks that Bernie's going to
[2:27:11.300 --> 2:27:19.380]  be JFK, the bigger a wedge we can drive between these people and the Democrat party. The more
[2:27:19.380 --> 2:27:25.180]  hell it is going to be come the general election when they try to put mini Mike Bloomberg with
[2:27:25.180 --> 2:27:29.620]  Hillary Clinton on the ticket or Joe Biden with Hillary Clinton on the ticket and they
[2:27:29.620 --> 2:27:33.500]  try to force that down the voters' throats when they get Bernie to stand up there again
[2:27:33.500 --> 2:27:38.620]  and put his head down and his hands in his lap and say, I endorse Hillary Clinton to
[2:27:38.620 --> 2:27:43.780]  be the president of the United States of America, the bigger the wedge we can drive the better.
[2:27:43.780 --> 2:27:47.620]  So we are still going to be joined by Alex Jones, but I want to just take a minute here
[2:27:47.620 --> 2:27:51.060]  before we go to break and hopefully we'll have Alex on the other side to remind you
[2:27:51.060 --> 2:27:55.660]  that even though we've got all this antics happening here in the United States, we can't
[2:27:55.660 --> 2:28:01.420]  forget what's happening and is slowly making its way to our shores. You can get great deals

[2:33:40.220 --> 2:33:45.740]  take over, but we'd be remiss if we didn't cover what happened last night. Of course,
[2:33:45.740 --> 2:33:49.020]  it was the big game. You know, you're not even allowed to say that. That's how much
[2:33:49.020 --> 2:33:53.660]  control the NFL has over our lives. In fact, you can't even say the words of the big game
[2:33:53.660 --> 2:33:58.460]  in an advertisement. Say you're advertising for a bar and grill. You can't even call it.
[2:33:58.460 --> 2:34:02.940]  Come see the big game at Joe Blow's bar and grill. Nope. You get in trouble. You get sued.
[2:34:02.940 --> 2:34:08.460]  You get taken off the air. It's amazing how much money, how much excitement is generated
[2:34:08.460 --> 2:34:13.260]  by how much the American psyche was because I think it is going away, but was really taken
[2:34:13.260 --> 2:34:18.900]  up by good old sports ball, good old handbag. But yesterday, of course, was the Super Bowl.
[2:34:18.900 --> 2:34:23.820]  It was the Kansas City Chiefs. According to Trump, they're based out of Kansas, so my
[2:34:23.820 --> 2:34:29.900]  hometown, my team, really they are. We had the Kansas City Chiefs versus the San Francisco
[2:34:29.900 --> 2:34:34.940]  49ers. The Kansas City Chiefs, multiple players have said nice things about Trump. One on
[2:34:34.940 --> 2:34:38.060]  the 49ers said nice things about Trump. Another said he wouldn't go to the White House. This
[2:34:38.060 --> 2:34:42.180]  is the 2D version of it. Oh boy, the Chiefs won. They're slightly more pro-Trump than
[2:34:42.180 --> 2:34:48.660]  the other team that had a call in Kaepernick on it. Now the real news is the cultural phenomenon
[2:34:48.660 --> 2:34:54.300]  because as Andrew Breitbart told us, as Alex Jones essentially says, culture politics is
[2:34:54.300 --> 2:35:01.700]  downstream from culture. So Jay-Z and Beyonce, I remember this is the 49ers, refused to stand
[2:35:01.700 --> 2:35:06.100]  for the National Anthem during the Super Bowl. Somebody happened to record a video of them
[2:35:06.100 --> 2:35:12.140]  on their smartphone as Demi Lovato was singing the National Anthem and it shows Beyonce Jay-Z
[2:35:12.140 --> 2:35:19.580]  with their child Blue Ivy, that poor child, refusing to stand during the National Anthem,
[2:35:19.580 --> 2:35:24.500]  which means in a way they didn't kneel, which I guess is progress after all. But in a way
[2:35:24.500 --> 2:35:30.660]  Colin Kaepernick's legacy is continuing to build. Of course, last year Betsy Ross, the
[2:35:30.660 --> 2:35:35.420]  flag became racist because Colin Kaepernick said it was and then Nike replaced it with
[2:35:35.420 --> 2:35:44.820]  a shoe that simply had the date of Kaepernick's first protest. So that was the start of the
[2:35:44.820 --> 2:35:51.140]  Super Bowl. As the majority of everyone is respectfully standing, hand over the heart,
[2:35:51.140 --> 2:35:57.140]  Jay-Z and Beyonce, who by the way, you may remember, they campaigned like hell for Hillary
[2:35:57.140 --> 2:36:03.020]  Clinton in 2016. They did free concerts for Hillary Clinton, free concerts with two of
[2:36:03.020 --> 2:36:10.380]  the biggest stars in contemporary music, doing free gigs for Hillary and she's still lost,
[2:36:10.380 --> 2:36:18.420]  isn't it beautiful? But then the halftime show, man, you guys thought the Lady Gaga
[2:36:18.420 --> 2:36:26.220]  won from a few years ago with Satanic. This was bizarre. We have the article up at NationalFile.com.
[2:36:26.220 --> 2:36:31.740]  Super Bowl halftime show featured pole dancing, strip club mimicry, and that's that's putting
[2:36:31.740 --> 2:36:35.380]  it kindly and guys in the control room. There's some profanity on this. And plus this is a
[2:36:35.380 --> 2:36:39.860]  family show. We don't need to we don't need to scar the viewers with seeing this. If they
[2:36:39.860 --> 2:36:44.580]  saw it last night during the Super Bowl, the Alex Jones show is nowhere near as crass as
[2:36:44.580 --> 2:36:50.900]  the Super Bowl. We'll just put it that way. But it's just bizarre. And you know, it reminds
[2:36:50.900 --> 2:36:59.180]  me of Paul's report from earlier today about the demographic replacement or the replacement
[2:36:59.180 --> 2:37:04.060]  migration happening here in the West because it's absolutely real. You can read it in UN
[2:37:04.060 --> 2:37:08.660]  documents. They try to call you racist if you bring it up, but you know, it's in the UN
[2:37:08.660 --> 2:37:13.820]  documents. So is the UN racist now? Maybe. So you've got there it is that disturbing
[2:37:13.820 --> 2:37:20.380]  video. TV viewers can see her flicking her tongue. This is Shakira, by the way, is 43
[2:37:20.380 --> 2:37:25.140]  years old flicking her tongue at the microphone. Jennifer Lopez, age 50, twerking on camera.
[2:37:25.140 --> 2:37:31.820]  At one point they bring out small children like 10 or 11 year old girls in in virginal
[2:37:31.820 --> 2:37:40.100]  white dresses. And this is within 15 seconds after 50 year old J. Lo is being grinded on
[2:37:40.100 --> 2:37:46.020]  by some guy in leather pants. And then they bring in these children and it's all Americana
[2:37:46.020 --> 2:37:50.380]  and it's in Spanish and it's Puerto Rico. So you know, this is really about replacement
[2:37:50.380 --> 2:37:53.220]  migration because for the past God knows how many years, you know, they've been saying
[2:37:53.220 --> 2:37:56.740]  we have 20 million illegals in this country or 11 million illegals in this country since
[2:37:56.740 --> 2:38:03.060]  the day I was born 25 years ago. So if you believe that there's really only 11 million
[2:38:03.060 --> 2:38:07.060]  illegals in this country, I don't know what to tell you. I half of Mexico and a third
[2:38:07.060 --> 2:38:11.100]  of Guatemala now live in the United States, but the numbers still magically just never
[2:38:11.100 --> 2:38:14.820]  goes up. So we've had years and years and years of replacement migration. We've had
[2:38:14.820 --> 2:38:19.940]  states like California totally go beyond blue. I mean, they are so deep blue. They're
[2:38:19.940 --> 2:38:24.660]  as deep and blue as they are in something else. Let's say that much. And so now you
[2:38:24.660 --> 2:38:28.900]  have to change your entertainment. You know, when you have a demographic shift, so does
[2:38:28.900 --> 2:38:35.780]  your culture. And so now you have these two middle aged women. I mean, had anybody even
[2:38:35.780 --> 2:38:45.580]  heard of J. Lo for the past 10 years before this twerking, doing strip club mimicry, dancing
[2:38:45.580 --> 2:38:53.020]  on poles with little children there laughing and singing. And it was some of the most bizarre
[2:38:53.020 --> 2:39:00.060]  television I'd ever seen. And of course, I watched this crap. So you folks don't have
[2:39:00.060 --> 2:39:07.580]  to. And this is the hot take. There's the little girls TV viewers can see. I mean, these
[2:39:07.580 --> 2:39:12.540]  kids, they're wearing they're wearing white dresses that are fairly low for a child. I
[2:39:12.540 --> 2:39:19.700]  mean, that is a that is a short cropped dress for a child. It's disturbing. And they're
[2:39:19.700 --> 2:39:29.740]  staring at the hind quarters of these 43 and 50 year old women as they twerk in their faces.
[2:39:29.740 --> 2:39:37.020]  It's drag queen story time on the big screen, essentially. But this is the hot take. This
[2:39:37.020 --> 2:39:43.780]  is the hot take from from woke Twitter. Trump supporters losing their collective minds after
[2:39:43.780 --> 2:39:50.140]  seeing all those black and brown folks at halftime. You see, we're going to sexualize
[2:39:50.140 --> 2:39:57.380]  children. We're going to reduce women to just sex objects. We're going to do all of this
[2:39:57.380 --> 2:40:02.900]  because it's going to trigger the white racist, the white racist Trump supporters. We have
[2:40:02.900 --> 2:40:09.500]  another article up at national file dot com. Twitter users were very, very upset for some
[2:40:09.500 --> 2:40:17.380]  reason that the chiefs won because they're racist because it's Kansas City chiefs. Their
[2:40:17.380 --> 2:40:22.500]  logo is an arrowhead. They play at Arrowhead Stadium. And they do this is I'm speak. Well,
[2:40:22.500 --> 2:40:26.380]  there's a video on this article, guys. We don't need the volume, but they do the arrowhead
[2:40:26.380 --> 2:40:31.740]  shop and it is so racist TV viewers. I'm sorry to expose you to this this this high level
[2:40:31.740 --> 2:40:39.940]  of racism. It's it's unimaginable. The arrowhead shop is where you make Indian noises and you
[2:40:39.940 --> 2:40:47.300]  you put your your elbow at a 45 degree angle. There it is. Oh, God, I'm sorry, TV viewers.
[2:40:47.300 --> 2:40:56.740]  This is so racist and you chop the arrowhead shop. It's so racist. So the it's not. There's
[2:40:56.740 --> 2:41:00.380]  nothing racist about this. In fact, many Indian tribes have actually given their blessing
[2:41:00.380 --> 2:41:03.740]  to this type of stuff. The Braves do it. The Redskins do it. The chiefs do it. But now
[2:41:03.740 --> 2:41:12.940]  it's racist. So nobody cares about these children being offered up in white, virginal outfits
[2:41:12.940 --> 2:41:19.300]  as JLo twerks in their face and Shakira flicks her tongue at the microphone and at the camera.
[2:41:19.300 --> 2:41:24.220]  Nobody cares about any of this. That's just the new America. That's just what we that's
[2:41:24.220 --> 2:41:31.260]  our multicultural society. But if a white person does this, TV viewers, I'm doing the
[2:41:31.260 --> 2:41:39.060]  chop radio listeners. I'm sorry, you can't see it. If a if a white person does that,
[2:41:39.060 --> 2:41:45.580]  if you're the Kansas City chiefs, by the way, we have huge Indian history in Kansas and Missouri.
[2:41:45.580 --> 2:41:53.340]  If you do this, then you're the real problem. You're the real problem. Absolutely hilariously.
[2:41:53.340 --> 2:41:56.660]  And then of course, the 49ers are racist, too. But they're racist against Chinese people,
[2:41:56.660 --> 2:42:02.260]  which is actually probably in 2020, even worse. But it's bizarre. It's bizarre. It's the degradation
[2:42:02.260 --> 2:42:08.220]  of our culture. It's the importion, the importation of third world aesthetics. And now it's here
[2:42:08.220 --> 2:42:13.380]  to stay. Try it out. And again, they're so, I mean, advanced in age 43 and 50 years old
[2:42:13.380 --> 2:42:17.860]  to be twerking like that. They act like the 15 years. It's bizarre. And I thought Miley
[2:42:17.860 --> 2:42:22.420]  Sirens was bad. In the next segment, we're going to have a special report from the one,
[2:42:22.420 --> 2:42:28.340]  the only Alex Jones. He will be back on the show live tomorrow. Then in the fourth hour,
[2:42:28.340 --> 2:42:32.420]  we will have guest host Gerald Salinte, a very, very talented, very, very intelligent
[2:42:32.420 --> 2:42:38.500]  man to give you his take on what's going on. I'm Tom Pepper, national file dot com editor
[2:42:38.500 --> 2:42:43.820]  in chief. Don't go away. You're going to want to see this special report about the coronavirus.
[2:42:43.820 --> 2:42:49.420]  Absolutely killer information from Alex Jones as usual. We'll be right back with it on the
[2:42:49.420 --> 2:43:00.500]  other side. This should really be easier than it is. I'm not here giving you a sales pitch.
[2:43:00.500 --> 2:43:06.620]  I'm pointing out the way forward things that I've discovered that I absolutely know work

[2:43:23.660 --> 2:43:28.660]  the good halogen, fluoride, the bad halogen. And people told me about it for years and
[2:43:28.660 --> 2:43:34.140]  I didn't listen and I'm so thankful that finally I listened to Dr. Grip like eight years ago
[2:43:34.140 --> 2:43:41.620]  started taking true iodine, atomic iodine. We've got it back in stock X two, 40% off

[2:45:58.660 --> 2:46:04.580]  dangerous developments concerning the coronavirus. It has now infected hundreds and hundreds
[2:46:04.580 --> 2:46:10.300]  of thousands of people. It is now spread across the entire planet. And of course we've now
[2:46:10.300 --> 2:46:14.820]  discovered that indeed it is man made and engineered. We're covering it live all with
[2:46:14.820 --> 2:46:20.500]  our team and info wars.com for its last show and band video. On top of that we have the
[2:46:20.500 --> 2:46:26.540]  patented nano silver that Congress A&M and Homeland Security have certified is able to
[2:46:26.540 --> 2:46:32.300]  take out the Corona family viruses and SARS. That's what it comes out of. We have that

[2:46:43.340 --> 2:46:48.380]  perfect except you know prayer in God's intervention. We hope this thing isn't as bad as it looks
[2:46:48.380 --> 2:46:53.380]  but definitely we know why governments are panicking right now because this is certainly
[2:46:53.380 --> 2:47:08.820]  a bizarre virus. You're listening to the Alex Jones show. From the front lines of the information
[2:47:08.820 --> 2:47:23.620]  war. It's Alex Jones. The magic of the HIV virus delivery system being added to an airborne
[2:47:23.620 --> 2:47:32.140]  pneumonia is beyond Stephen King's stand. And that's what's admitted. mainstream media
[2:47:32.140 --> 2:47:38.540]  admits that the Indian University is right that has the HIV delivery system in it. They're
[2:47:38.540 --> 2:47:47.420]  just saying oh it's not man made. Whether it's man made or not this is news of biblical
[2:47:47.420 --> 2:47:53.260]  proportions and it's confirmed. So why is all a big tech suppressing this information.
[2:47:53.260 --> 2:48:03.580]  We're going to answer that question right now. I read an article last night or yesterday
[2:48:03.580 --> 2:48:11.860]  afternoon about 5 p.m. from zero hedge and it was so shocking that I went into the office
[2:48:11.860 --> 2:48:16.700]  and did like three hours of research and it was so incredible. I couldn't even make myself
[2:48:16.700 --> 2:48:21.060]  get on air because I had to make some phone calls of virologist. I had to do a bunch more
[2:48:21.060 --> 2:48:31.940]  research and now here I am on Saturday night and I'm just going to say I dropped the ball.
[2:48:31.940 --> 2:48:36.220]  I was trying to tell listeners that hey this coronavirus probably in that big a deal it's
[2:48:36.220 --> 2:48:42.180]  a big UN drill. That's why you're seeing this overreaction and I still hope that's the case
[2:48:42.180 --> 2:48:53.700]  but zero hedge got suspended on Twitter for posting this article and then linking to the
[2:48:53.700 --> 2:49:02.020]  scientists that are in the major scientific paper published two days ago by one of the
[2:49:02.020 --> 2:49:08.140]  most prestigious. It's in the top two or three colleges. Kusma School of Biological Sciences
[2:49:08.140 --> 2:49:14.180]  in the Institute of Technology New Delhi and this big report that's got scans of the virus,
[2:49:14.180 --> 2:49:24.660]  the RNA breakdown, the proteins. I mean this is it and so zero hedge got suspended for
[2:49:24.660 --> 2:49:29.180]  writing about this but then I found all these other mainstream articles going yeah it's
[2:49:29.180 --> 2:49:41.180]  true here's the bombshell that part of the HIV virus is part of this but they say but
[2:49:41.180 --> 2:49:47.100]  that's no big deal. That happens a lot. I spent hours it's never happened before. The
[2:49:47.100 --> 2:49:52.540]  scientists are on record believing that HIV has been engineered because it's not a normally
[2:49:52.540 --> 2:49:57.380]  behaving virus. I'm not a virologist I'm going off what they're saying and so they point
[2:49:57.380 --> 2:50:03.700]  out in this major study that they scanned it they looked at it and it's welded in. It's
[2:50:03.700 --> 2:50:11.300]  just phony is a three dollar bill and then zero hedge gets taken down as fake news so
[2:50:11.300 --> 2:50:17.540]  I spent like I said hours yesterday hours today obsessed on this going into the studies
[2:50:17.540 --> 2:50:23.100]  going into articles and just dozens of big mainstream reports going hey yeah it's got
[2:50:23.100 --> 2:50:29.100]  part of the AIDS virus in it but that's no big deal it's not man-made. What does that
[2:50:29.100 --> 2:50:38.820]  mean? It's got a protein enablation system basically a weapon where it can plug in to
[2:50:38.820 --> 2:50:44.300]  the mucous membrane of the body and then it carries everything else it's got and it's
[2:50:44.300 --> 2:50:51.740]  that part that exact signature that blueprint like a 57 Chevy you see a 57 Chevy your eyes
[2:50:51.740 --> 2:50:55.700]  no that's 57 Chevy you see Marilyn Monroe that's Marilyn Monroe you see Michael Jackson
[2:50:55.700 --> 2:51:00.380]  that's Michael Jackson you see Kobe Bryant that's Kobe Bryant you see Donald Trump you
[2:51:00.380 --> 2:51:06.580]  go that's all I mean your eye knows what it is the computers are a hundred percent and
[2:51:06.580 --> 2:51:13.780]  the fact that this virus has this the scientists are clear no way this came out of some grocery
[2:51:13.780 --> 2:51:22.860]  store some weird you know animals sales place the Chinese eat weird bats not that's healthy
[2:51:22.860 --> 2:51:28.100]  so that's the takeaway here is that you should go read this study for yourself and you should
[2:51:28.100 --> 2:51:33.100]  ask yourself why is Twitter why is Facebook why is Google trying to block this because
[2:51:33.100 --> 2:51:39.420]  it's the Indians that 20 years ago tested a bunch of UN vaccines for tetanus and it had
[2:51:39.420 --> 2:51:43.900]  a female hormone added to it even though that wasn't part of the production that would then
[2:51:43.900 --> 2:51:48.980]  create an autoimmune response that hormone that women released the second month of pregnancy
[2:51:48.980 --> 2:51:54.700]  so it causes an autoimmune response to the baby and spontaneous abortion about 95 percent
[2:51:54.700 --> 2:52:00.700]  of the time and so I want to give the Indians props time and time again it's just the Indian
[2:52:00.700 --> 2:52:04.700]  scientists that have been proven right they were the ones that got Gardasil banned in
[2:52:04.700 --> 2:52:09.700]  most the world they went and showed how it's giving people cancer and sterilizing people
[2:52:09.700 --> 2:52:16.260]  so I'm not some Indian file here that just worships Indians I just keep noticing their
[2:52:16.260 --> 2:52:21.060]  scientists don't give a damn and we'll put the truth out and they've done it again and
[2:52:21.060 --> 2:52:25.220]  he's been so many times it's the Indians because they're smart they're everybody knows that
[2:52:25.220 --> 2:52:29.260]  and they're whatever they're not under control I mean everybody knows about Indians they're
[2:52:29.260 --> 2:52:32.180]  not even on their own government's control I'm on an enemy of Modi it's just he doesn't
[2:52:32.180 --> 2:52:40.500]  run them either and they're telling you that this virus has all the hallmarks of being
[2:52:40.500 --> 2:52:51.620]  engineered and it's got a 2020 Hellcat wired into a 1957 Chevy and it's just fake it didn't
[2:52:51.620 --> 2:53:00.300]  it didn't come out of mama's backyard it's it's it didn't grow on a tree it's synthetic
[2:53:00.300 --> 2:53:06.100]  and the articles everywhere trying to counter it are like oh no no well sure you could have
[2:53:06.100 --> 2:53:12.820]  the part of the AIDS virus in it the HIV virus that reportedly causes AIDS that's the exact
[2:53:12.820 --> 2:53:20.980]  system that plugs in that's the exact system that allows it to bridge in and it's got that
[2:53:20.980 --> 2:53:26.660]  and I looked it up it's not a common virus it's extremely rare virus that most engineers
[2:53:26.660 --> 2:53:34.980]  believe has been twink tinkered with and now the HIV virus is part of this and the media
[2:53:34.980 --> 2:53:39.900]  is admitting that but going fake news it's not a bio weapon yeah it's got part of the
[2:53:39.900 --> 2:53:49.140]  AIDS virus HIV virus that allows it to transmit but just don't worry about that and that's
[2:53:49.140 --> 2:53:53.500]  why you've seen hundreds of microbiologists murdered the last few years run over shot
[2:53:53.500 --> 2:53:57.340]  in the back of the head everything because they don't want people that are able to identify
[2:53:57.340 --> 2:54:01.340]  what's going on to be around and that's done ahead of the bio attack I don't know who's
[2:54:01.340 --> 2:54:07.420]  behind it I don't have all the answers obviously and I've as a father have been hoping this
[2:54:07.420 --> 2:54:11.620]  isn't as bad as some are saying and playing it down there and my leaders are like hey
[2:54:11.620 --> 2:54:16.660]  dude are you covering up what's going on like no I don't want this to be bad I've had family
[2:54:16.660 --> 2:54:21.060]  died pneumonia I take this stuff seriously and I will not sit there and be part of hyping
[2:54:21.060 --> 2:54:27.060]  something up that isn't serious but the response to this has been unprecedented it's a huge
[2:54:27.060 --> 2:54:31.420]  world government chai com drill the UN worshipping it that's bad enough so I'm like oh it's just
[2:54:31.420 --> 2:54:35.500]  a drill it's not that bad don't worry and then all of a sudden I see this and they're
[2:54:35.500 --> 2:54:39.100]  blocking zero hedge it's saying zero hedge made it up and I go read the actual paper
[2:54:39.100 --> 2:54:43.340]  and all the articles going well it's true the Indians scan this and it does have the HIV
[2:54:43.340 --> 2:54:51.580]  virus part of it and just the delivery system no big deal and and I'm not a virologist I'm
[2:54:51.580 --> 2:54:55.980]  just reading what the virologists are saying and main lambs are like yeah this is really
[2:54:55.980 --> 2:55:01.340]  looking bad and you see the Washington Post and and and and BBC and AP and Reuters anybody
[2:55:01.340 --> 2:55:07.100]  questioning this is man made will be banned off the internet well yeah if I was wrong
[2:55:07.100 --> 2:55:13.380]  I should be allowed to question that that's just the public's right to have their opinion
[2:55:13.380 --> 2:55:17.100]  so they're really scared of this I just a few other points and I'll end this special report
[2:55:17.100 --> 2:55:24.580]  new coronavirus in China is treated with HIV meds when this first broke people sure as
[2:55:24.580 --> 2:55:29.100]  hell we're saying oh my god they're gonna treat it with those age drugs that are known to
[2:55:29.100 --> 2:55:36.180]  kill people I'm like oh come on man that it's not that and then boom CNN they're all reporting
[2:55:36.180 --> 2:55:41.660]  oh don't worry the coronavirus is treated with age drugs but it has nothing to do with
[2:55:41.660 --> 2:55:51.820]  AIDS or by the virus HIV even though it's in the genetic code the RNA of it and they
[2:55:51.820 --> 2:55:59.340]  admit that but it's fake news and say it's man made even though top scientists are saying
[2:55:59.340 --> 2:56:08.860]  this is synthetic wow and you know folks have a lot of courage in India at this major you
[2:56:08.860 --> 2:56:16.860]  know top scientific university to come out and say this and I just think that you deserve
[2:56:16.860 --> 2:56:20.260]  and your family deserves and they deserve you actually read it and then look at the foot
[2:56:20.260 --> 2:56:24.860]  notes because I didn't just believe their footnotes I went and checked it all and I was like whoa
[2:56:24.860 --> 2:56:30.380]  there's only one protein that's in the HIV virus folks and this is it it has nothing
[2:56:30.380 --> 2:56:36.740]  to do with bird flu nothing to do with corona nothing to do with SARS they've taken a pneumonia
[2:56:36.740 --> 2:56:45.660]  virus and put HIV in it because HIV doesn't replicate well in the body but it will take
[2:56:45.660 --> 2:56:51.980]  over your white blood cells your team of sites you'll kill your defenses but it doesn't replicate
[2:56:51.980 --> 2:57:03.020]  doesn't spread well HIV just got added to a super communicable airborne pneumonia virus
[2:57:03.020 --> 2:57:08.460]  and I just want Bill Gates and all the globalists to know something anything happens to my family
[2:57:08.460 --> 2:57:12.860]  everybody care about I'm holding you personally responsible understand because you're on record
[2:57:12.860 --> 2:57:17.460]  saying you're going to reduce the world population and having Ted talks laughing where we're going
[2:57:17.460 --> 2:57:21.580]  to reduce this number to zero to help the earth and the number they lied up as the humans
[2:57:21.580 --> 2:57:25.220]  I mean you know you're saying you're going to kill me and my family and you think you're
[2:57:25.220 --> 2:57:30.260]  going to creep around and do it well whatever the hell this is and I'm not saying that's
[2:57:30.260 --> 2:57:35.020]  what this is I'm not saying a duck that's yellow and quacks against the waters of duck
[2:57:35.020 --> 2:57:43.140]  all I'm saying is you guys think you're going to run some soft kills stuff on us it's not
[2:57:43.140 --> 2:57:46.660]  the other way you think I love watching David night in the morning I love tuning in to Owen
[2:57:46.660 --> 2:57:51.780]  shroyer I love all the other shows we do here but I'll be honest with you we run during
[2:57:51.780 --> 2:57:57.340]  the breaks a lot of news reports because I'm sick of hearing the ads so you think you don't
[2:57:57.340 --> 2:58:01.660]  want to hear an ad I don't want to hear an ad but here's the bottom line we're barely
[2:58:01.660 --> 2:58:05.580]  paying the bills here and I want to expand the face the globalists not contract I don't
[2:58:05.580 --> 2:58:10.940]  want them to win so listen you've got this guarantee for me we saw enough product we'll
[2:58:10.940 --> 2:58:15.100]  have less ads and less plugs and we'll expand and really give the globalists run for their
[2:58:15.100 --> 2:58:20.380]  money but we've got products you already really need like DNA Force Plus X2 these will change

[3:00:16.740 --> 3:00:28.620]  hello glad to be on the Alex Jones show what a trip what a trip going on around the world
[3:00:28.620 --> 3:00:39.140]  watch out everybody watch out watch out everybody watch out coronavirus coronavirus
[3:00:39.140 --> 3:00:47.980]  goodbye Rosie Queen of Corona see me and Julio down by the schoolyard oh watch out watch out
[3:00:47.980 --> 3:00:56.260]  how bad is it oh 300 and something people already died in China they found a case over
[3:00:56.260 --> 3:01:09.820]  there in the Philippines I'm not good at math but figure it out was 1.4 billion people in
[3:01:09.820 --> 3:01:29.340]  China about 300 died this is a pandemic 300 people it's nothing at a 1.4 billion people
[3:01:29.340 --> 3:01:40.820]  about 9000 is sick yeah so 9000 people get sick every day and something millions do and
[3:01:40.820 --> 3:01:46.420]  the people that are dying of the coronavirus are usually elderly with or others with chronic
[3:01:46.420 --> 3:02:01.060]  diseases and people going down and it really took a hit on the Chinese whoop yeah hit on
[3:02:01.060 --> 3:02:06.900]  the people like to celebrate go out and party and travel a lot now places empty it's really
[3:02:06.900 --> 3:02:14.140]  going to hurt their economy and look what it did to the equity markets whoop last week
[3:02:14.140 --> 3:02:24.500]  the Dow is down 600 points today bounce back gold price wow heading to that $1,600 an ounce
[3:02:24.500 --> 3:02:33.260]  mark and then they pull back a bit they're still looking strong I talk about the coronavirus
[3:02:33.260 --> 3:02:39.900]  because as I again I'm not an expert in this field nor do I pretend to be I'm just looking
[3:02:39.900 --> 3:02:48.540]  at the numbers and what they're saying this is worse than SARS virus so I look up SARS
[3:02:48.540 --> 3:02:54.740]  virus you know that's one thing about the Internet it's the Alexandrian library man
[3:02:54.740 --> 3:03:00.580]  you can look up stuff I can't say when if I don't say women man women you could look
[3:03:00.580 --> 3:03:05.900]  up anything real quick a lot of stuff so what how many people died with the SARS SARS virus
[3:03:05.900 --> 3:03:20.780]  they say about 800 to 600 and had a population back then of what about over 6 billion people
[3:03:20.780 --> 3:03:29.900]  and only 800 at times died that's like that's no number at all a couple of million people
[3:03:29.900 --> 3:03:38.980]  by year road accidents around the world with 800 people so I look at this like there's
[3:03:38.980 --> 3:03:45.820]  a hurricane coming there's a hurricane coming can you see all these little boys and girls
[3:03:45.820 --> 3:03:52.980]  play in prostitutes holding their camera up there and the wind blowing shoe and a rain
[3:03:52.980 --> 3:04:01.060]  coming down and a show the waves coming watch out your evacuation evacuation when you activated
[3:04:01.060 --> 3:04:07.900]  half of Florida because the current tomorrow and then not a lot happened that's why I see
[3:04:07.900 --> 3:04:16.820]  this with the SARS virus excuse me corona goodbye Rosie Queen of Corona again could it get bad
[3:04:16.820 --> 3:04:24.300]  listen we could die so many different ways all the poisons that they're pumping into
[3:04:24.300 --> 3:04:35.140]  our bodies all them pharmaceuticals that they love to shoot into everybody's body that they
[3:04:35.140 --> 3:04:48.220]  can that's okay we could do more of that but you you follow us we'll tell you what we'll
[3:04:48.220 --> 3:04:56.220]  tell you when we come back info wars life is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine
[3:04:56.220 --> 3:05:01.700]  introducing pollen block we have found an extraordinary new natural way to alleviate
[3:05:01.700 --> 3:05:08.140]  seasonal distress symptoms including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways eye comfort
[3:05:08.140 --> 3:05:14.460]  and respiratory function in the 1960s researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain
[3:05:14.460 --> 3:05:20.220]  quail eggs experienced less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses they began studying
[3:05:20.220 --> 3:05:25.220]  this effect in published trials and decades later we now have the fruit of this research
[3:05:25.220 --> 3:05:30.980]  a fast-acting chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms pollen block is
[3:05:30.980 --> 3:05:36.580]  natural and effective it is not an antihistamine in fact current research has found that it
[3:05:36.580 --> 3:05:41.460]  actually acts by blocking the activity of triptase which is an enzyme that amplifies
[3:05:41.460 --> 3:05:47.500]  immune and inflammatory responses in the body go outside and enjoy the air you breathe head
[3:05:47.500 --> 3:06:03.180]  to info wars life dot com and grab a pack of our pollen block chewable tablets waging
[3:06:03.180 --> 3:06:14.500]  war on corruption it's Gerald Salente you're listening to the Alex Jones show hello hello
[3:06:14.500 --> 3:06:21.220]  love being on the Alex Jones show and remember do what you can to support Alex Jones and
[3:06:21.220 --> 3:06:27.820]  info wars and all the information that they put out and all the people that they help
[3:06:27.820 --> 3:06:37.300]  and their products I swear by I could swear by super mill vitality that's my favorite
[3:06:37.300 --> 3:06:43.540]  and everybody got their own trip you know anyway going back to how the prostitutes are
[3:06:43.540 --> 3:06:50.060]  pumping up this coronavirus and now China is saying it's an attack on them so let's
[3:06:50.060 --> 3:06:59.620]  turn it into the economic end right now the markets are rebounding but oil prices way
[3:06:59.620 --> 3:07:10.260]  down let me see before I came on the air I think they were what about $54 and 37 cents
[3:07:10.260 --> 3:07:26.020]  or a barrel of Brent crude places like Saudi Arabia they need that oil about $100 a barrel
[3:07:26.020 --> 3:07:32.980]  their economy to break even all these oil exporting countries the price of oil was going
[3:07:32.980 --> 3:07:44.660]  down for four weeks before goodbye Rosie Queen of Corona virus hit is a global slow down
[3:07:44.660 --> 3:07:55.460]  going on this is big this virus is going to hurt China it's going to hurt their economy
[3:07:55.460 --> 3:08:02.940]  and their economy is already growing at a 29 year low but even that 29 year low at 6.1
[3:08:02.940 --> 3:08:12.340]  percent is pretty good considering over there in Europe where they're looking for a 1% growth
[3:08:12.340 --> 3:08:19.380]  of the economy in the United States 2019 we only grew 2.3% next year they're forecasting
[3:08:19.380 --> 3:08:27.340]  2% as the same as under Obama so oil prices they're going down because there's more supply
[3:08:27.340 --> 3:08:36.500]  than demand is a global slow down and it's real and what's China going to do they're
[3:08:36.500 --> 3:08:43.020]  going to have to lower their interest rates they got inflation their inflation compared
[3:08:43.020 --> 3:08:48.020]  to what a lot of countries have because they built so fast and the prices went up so fast
[3:08:48.020 --> 3:08:58.300]  so they have inflation and stagflation the economy is not growing like they needed to
[3:08:58.300 --> 3:09:04.500]  so if you raise interest rates to stop that inflation so you could slow it down a little
[3:09:04.500 --> 3:09:12.300]  bit and your economy is already stagnant that brings the economy down lower so they're going

[3:19:09.420 --> 3:19:15.460]  when it comes to promoting Americana and basic liberty is amazing as well he's still lacking
[3:19:15.460 --> 3:19:20.700]  on the big tech censorship taking action against that in some other areas but tried to end
[3:19:20.700 --> 3:19:25.020]  the wars boosting our economy speaking out against communist China Trump's been doing
[3:19:25.020 --> 3:19:31.100]  an amazing job but now more than ever we really have to realize that we're being targeted
[3:19:31.100 --> 3:19:37.300]  because we are effective and the globalist are beginning to lose their war against humanity
[3:19:37.300 --> 3:19:41.300]  in a big way and so we're going to see some major fireworks out of them but it's critical
[3:19:41.300 --> 3:19:46.660]  to not let ourselves get down when we see all the poison they spray at us that's an
[3:19:46.660 --> 3:19:55.940]  attempt to demoralize us we've got to remember that and stay focused and stay happy you're
[3:19:55.940 --> 3:20:19.060]  listening to the alex jones show maybe I could dance in the Super Bowl

[3:20:59.980 --> 3:21:09.700]  are and who we can and should be I said I have a solution one of them of course is we
[3:21:09.700 --> 3:21:15.420]  need peace and that's why again I ask you to please do what you can to support occupy
[3:21:15.420 --> 3:21:22.300]  peace bring home all the troops close the bases overseas this is just making a military
[3:21:22.300 --> 3:21:31.420]  industrial complex rich what are we doing bases in in Italy and in Germany and in Okinawa

[3:21:38.860 --> 3:21:49.700]  eroded infrastructure secure the homeland give them skills and I'll get that from rebuilding
[3:21:49.700 --> 3:21:56.620]  our eroded infrastructure you know what I want I want a GI Bill of Rights a Bill of
[3:21:56.620 --> 3:22:04.700]  Rights that they serve and not in war but they serve to protect us at home and help
[3:22:04.700 --> 3:22:14.220]  build our land to the way it should be and give them skills to work so when they leave
[3:22:14.220 --> 3:22:19.780]  the service the contractors are looking for skilled people manufacturing now we have more
[3:22:19.780 --> 3:22:28.900]  skilled people number three on occupy peace force Congress these little low life slimy
[3:22:28.900 --> 3:22:37.020]  girls and boys who violate the Constitution and have not voted to go to war since World
[3:22:37.020 --> 3:22:43.380]  War two hey we're a bunch of little coward so if we do the wrong thing we want to give
[3:22:43.380 --> 3:22:47.980]  it to President they have lost the status to need us to do what they want to do we'll
[3:22:47.980 --> 3:22:55.180]  give them a all in a military authority that he wants we'll violate the Constitution hey
[3:22:55.180 --> 3:23:01.700]  so empty take that Constitution and shove it oh yeah come over here and tell me that
[3:23:01.700 --> 3:23:15.260]  senator you or congressman that and finally step four put a referendum on each state ballot
[3:23:15.260 --> 3:23:22.460]  where we tell Congress how to vote whether or not to go to war we the people who pay
[3:23:22.460 --> 3:23:32.740]  for the war with our money on our lives not the senator's son that's occupied peace and
[3:23:32.740 --> 3:23:37.780]  what's the last thing I said a referendum on each state ballot and when I said to you
[3:23:37.780 --> 3:23:47.740]  yes I have an answer to save America and bring it back to we the people of the United States
[3:23:47.740 --> 3:23:58.980]  in order to form a more perfect union we have direct democracy that's right direct democracy
[3:23:58.980 --> 3:24:14.180]  this is from my trends journal some issue 2011 that's when it was a quarterly now it's
[3:24:14.180 --> 3:24:24.940]  a weekly because events are changing so fast direct democracy we the people not some slimy
[3:24:24.940 --> 3:24:39.700]  little low life with a lot of dough that wants to run not these people that spend all their
[3:24:39.700 --> 3:24:47.980]  time of their life wasting it in Iowa to get a left to win the the primary can you imagine
[3:24:47.980 --> 3:24:55.980]  wasting your life like that to throw out your BS to everybody and get enough of them I don't

[3:31:46.420 --> 3:31:50.460]  shelves the water won't be available you might not be able to leave your house you got to
[3:31:50.460 --> 3:31:56.260]  be prepared before it comes down well it's here the year 2020 world governments out in
[3:31:56.260 --> 3:32:00.500]  the open we've got the predicted mass pandemics and they're calling for global government as
[3:32:00.500 --> 3:32:06.540]  the answer and we've got massive huge censorship taking place it's coordinated by big tech and
[3:32:06.540 --> 3:32:12.940]  banks against people that promote America and guns and freedom and Jesus and the family
[3:32:12.940 --> 3:32:17.980]  and the protection of the unborn wow yes now we know we're right the new world order is
[3:32:17.980 --> 3:32:22.860]  real Satanism is real the pedophile a leader real but we're real as well and we love God
[3:32:22.860 --> 3:32:26.740]  and we're standing up and saying no but I just want to make the point here one month
[3:32:26.740 --> 3:32:32.140]  into 2020 that we have never been in Kansas we have never been in some smallville place
[3:32:32.140 --> 3:32:36.780]  that didn't matter everything we do every decision we make governs the future of our
[3:32:36.780 --> 3:32:40.060]  species and everything we've gone through and everything we're going to go through
[3:32:40.060 --> 3:32:43.620]  so it's an incredible time to be alive I want to thank you all for being aware and being
[3:32:43.620 --> 3:32:49.060]  involved but just remember your action now the prayer word of mouth and financial support
[3:32:49.060 --> 3:33:15.060]  of our store is critical so please take action you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[3:33:15.060 --> 3:33:29.300]  and now your host Gerald Solente hello hello great being on the Alex Jones show oh what
[3:33:29.300 --> 3:33:34.780]  a show today I'm very excited about it talking about the things that matter the most our
[3:33:34.780 --> 3:33:41.620]  freedom number one number one when you're free you're free to be you as I say I'm one
[3:33:41.620 --> 3:33:49.700]  of the luckiest men in the world Anapolitano born in the Bronx born to be free born to
[3:33:49.700 --> 3:33:59.060]  be me and that's my America direct democracy free to be you not to be told what to do by
[3:33:59.060 --> 3:34:10.340]  a little class of clowns that they call Congress so in this last segment before I say see you
[3:34:10.340 --> 3:34:17.820]  next week on a market front the markets are up today and gold prices are down a little
[3:34:17.820 --> 3:34:22.180]  bit but there's still over 1580 one of the important ones to watch besides oil prices
[3:34:22.180 --> 3:34:27.740]  going down and remember there's they're even cutting back on supply and there's still much
[3:34:27.740 --> 3:34:33.900]  too much supply the Libyan war that the Nobel Peace a crap prize winner Obama started along
[3:34:33.900 --> 3:34:41.660]  with Samantha Powell Hillary Clinton and Susan Rice only the women were in charge as I said
[3:34:41.660 --> 3:34:45.300]  I don't want to hear any of that stuff race creed college and that makes no difference
[3:34:45.300 --> 3:34:51.340]  to me good and bad comes in all of them so they cut way back on oil over there because
[3:34:51.340 --> 3:34:58.780]  of Obama's launching with Cameron and Sarkozy and Cameron of the UK and Sarkozy of France
[3:34:58.780 --> 3:35:02.940]  the destruction of Libya which was the richest country in the area and the people had more
[3:35:02.940 --> 3:35:07.580]  rights than anywhere else so now the civil war going on over there no oil is coming
[3:35:07.580 --> 3:35:14.300]  out of there barely down to nothing and even with these shutdowns is still much too much
[3:35:14.300 --> 3:35:20.540]  supply so it tells you where the global economy is going and again I do not give financial
[3:35:20.540 --> 3:35:26.940]  advice not at all I believe gold prices have the ability and will spike toward two thousand
[3:35:26.940 --> 3:35:34.300]  dollars an ounce copper prices shoot they've gone way down they were way up just a few
[3:35:34.300 --> 3:35:41.460]  weeks ago copper they call it doctor copper because copper is used in a lot of stuff you
[3:35:41.460 --> 3:35:48.980]  know from from high-tech to heavy industry and China is one of the biggest buyers of
[3:35:48.980 --> 3:35:56.500]  the stuff over 50% so you see copper prices going down like this that's the warning and
[3:35:56.500 --> 3:36:03.380]  now you're seeing that inverted yield curve with a short-term short-term bonds give you
[3:36:03.380 --> 3:36:08.460]  a high yield in the long-term bonds and that's the signal in recession this has been going
[3:36:08.460 --> 3:36:14.820]  on a couple of times last year now it's back again the equity markets are being artificially
[3:36:14.820 --> 3:36:25.260]  propped up with monetary methadone we just heard from our central banks the chief over
[3:36:25.260 --> 3:36:35.620]  there power last week Jerome power indicating that they pumping in another 60 billion dollars
[3:36:35.620 --> 3:36:42.620]  a month in quantitative easing bond buybacks but you're not allowed to call it quantitative
[3:36:42.620 --> 3:36:49.780]  easing because L head of the central banks who said you can't now I mentioned what's
[3:36:49.780 --> 3:36:57.820]  going on in China India economy seven straight quarters down and they got riots on the streets
[3:36:57.820 --> 3:37:04.660]  because of the citizenship law that robs Muslims of their rights in India what India is doing
[3:37:04.660 --> 3:37:10.940]  with cashmere taking away its autonomy and now millions of people striking taking to
[3:37:10.940 --> 3:37:20.220]  the streets because of poverty increasing things can be blowing up over there is going
[3:37:20.220 --> 3:37:28.100]  on around the world that goes back to gold being a safe haven asset and again I am not
[3:37:28.100 --> 3:37:36.020]  recommending to buy anything I'm telling you what I see the greatest depression is going
[3:37:36.020 --> 3:37:47.940]  to happen in 2021 Trump will be the Herbert Hoover was back in 1931 90 years later it's
[3:37:47.940 --> 3:37:55.780]  going to be Trump if not sooner and you can see when I say if not sooner because of the
[3:37:55.780 --> 3:38:05.980]  good bye Rosie queen of coronavirus a wild card man made or made by nature if I say nature
[3:38:05.980 --> 3:38:11.180]  and I say mother nature I got to say father nature so you never know what's going to
[3:38:11.180 --> 3:38:16.860]  happen that's why nobody could forecast I predict rather you could forecast but things
[3:38:16.860 --> 3:38:29.820]  change you can't predict it nobody has the humans insides to do it in the heart or soul
[3:38:29.820 --> 3:38:37.300]  so it can change this year too as you said the homeless issue and I have a solution for
[3:38:37.300 --> 3:38:44.620]  it partial I'm up here in Kingston New York foothills of the beautiful Catskill Mountains
[3:38:44.620 --> 3:38:52.020]  used to call this area up here the borst belt back in the day all the great comedians and
[3:38:52.020 --> 3:38:59.860]  actors the Phil Silvers and the Jerry Lewises and the Dean Martins and all these funny cats
[3:38:59.860 --> 3:39:07.340]  and great musicians used to play up here they had beautiful hotels big Jewish population
[3:39:07.340 --> 3:39:12.820]  from the city getting away from the city and going to the country for the summer and then
[3:39:12.820 --> 3:39:21.140]  the jet set happened the 60s people are flying everywhere going a having a great time flying
[3:39:21.140 --> 3:39:28.020]  was brand new and this place died died from a thousand hotels that went to virtually nothing
[3:39:28.020 --> 3:39:35.380]  beautiful beautiful hotels swimming pools beautiful now they're vacant although the
[3:39:35.380 --> 3:39:44.500]  whole area is coming back big time now they're vacant so you have a lot of state land you
[3:39:44.500 --> 3:39:54.620]  have a lot of federal land let's build places for the homeless people don't want to be homeless
[3:39:54.620 --> 3:40:00.020]  wait to my generation the baby boomer so many are going to be in poverty the numbers are
[3:40:00.020 --> 3:40:06.620]  there they don't have the savings people used to come up here because they wanted to be in
[3:40:06.620 --> 3:40:14.700]  the beautiful country and it's gorgeous like in a lot of other places so we build out these
[3:40:14.700 --> 3:40:22.860]  areas for them you want to camp you can camp you want to farm you can farm you want to work
[3:40:22.860 --> 3:40:28.300]  at this you can work at that rather than spending this ridiculous money like they're doing in
[3:40:28.300 --> 3:40:34.740]  New York City and putting almost people in these these buildings they're doing all over
[3:40:34.740 --> 3:40:41.260]  the world how putting in motels it doesn't give you a life being stuck in a room let's
[3:40:41.260 --> 3:40:50.100]  create something let's build it up I guess you could call it Boys Town and Girls Town
[3:40:50.100 --> 3:41:00.860]  2020 so there are solutions and one of the biggest ones is as I say it we cannot keep
[3:41:00.860 --> 3:41:10.740]  spending over a trillion dollars on war between the defense budget and what they give the
[3:41:10.740 --> 3:41:22.140]  intelligence agency and that word intelligence to me is an oxymoron let's put this money
[3:41:22.140 --> 3:41:32.900]  for us we the people hey you like that idea let's have a vote what do you think why don't
[3:41:32.900 --> 3:41:42.260]  we decide get back to work you don't decide you get back to work I call it taxes actually

[3:44:52.300 --> 3:44:56.540]  I want to talk about super silver whitening toothpaste because I hadn't tried it except
[3:44:56.540 --> 3:45:01.060]  for maybe the last week and a half and I told Alex I said man this is the best toothpaste
[3:45:01.060 --> 3:45:04.100]  I've ever tried he's like well what are you doing just sitting in here telling me you
[3:45:04.100 --> 3:45:10.060]  got to get up there and tell me so here I am telling people super silver whitening toothpaste
[3:45:10.060 --> 3:45:15.260]  is by far the best toothpaste I've ever tried and I'm 45 years old and I've tried a lot
[3:45:15.260 --> 3:45:20.260]  of different toothpaste and it's fluoride free I think the big difference the game changer
[3:45:20.260 --> 3:45:25.100]  in this is the coral calcium because after I brush my teeth with this they feel so clean
[3:45:25.100 --> 3:45:29.780]  and the toothpaste that I don't even like rinse out my mouth after I brush my teeth with this
[3:45:29.780 --> 3:45:35.620]  it feels so good it feels like it feels like good things are happening in my mouth in fact
[3:45:35.620 --> 3:45:41.460]  I find myself brushing my teeth three to four times a day rather than just twice a day now
[3:45:41.460 --> 3:45:52.740]  because I like the way it feels
[3:45:52.740 --> 3:45:57.260]  with the daily wear and tear of the environment on our skin it's only natural that it starts

[3:47:44.860 --> 3:47:52.580]  fast anyway missed the countdown but here we're back and I'm glad because I want to
[3:47:52.580 --> 3:48:00.260]  stay with what I was talking about with this global slowdown what I do each day as I go
[3:48:00.260 --> 3:48:06.700]  through different news this is the Financial Times New York Times Wall Street Journal
[3:48:06.700 --> 3:48:12.780]  Market Watch a whole bunch of different CNBC and I write and look for headlines and stories
[3:48:12.780 --> 3:48:18.780]  read the whole story do I get the important points to give an overview of the current
[3:48:18.780 --> 3:48:25.060]  events and see how they're forming future trends when I talk about where the economy
[3:48:25.060 --> 3:48:31.380]  is going why gold prices they're going to keep all the central banks there are those
[3:48:31.380 --> 3:48:36.420]  that are already in negative interest rates they're going to go lower yet they're going
[3:48:36.420 --> 3:48:45.340]  to go to even further down in negativity like they did over there in the European Union
[3:48:45.340 --> 3:48:52.580]  you have a negative rate now of what 0.5 percent it was 0.4 percent you have negative rates
[3:48:52.580 --> 3:49:04.340]  over in Japan and here's from the Financial Times Japan's government is nominated a dovish
[3:49:04.340 --> 3:49:11.620]  economist to the board of its central bank in a signal that Prime Minister Shinzo Abe
[3:49:11.620 --> 3:49:20.780]  is continuing and committed to a large program of monetary easing despite growing complaints
[3:49:20.780 --> 3:49:31.380]  from banks about the downside of negative interest rates the selection of the new board
[3:49:31.380 --> 3:49:42.700]  guy suggests Mr. Abe will not back away from his signature stimulus program known as abenomics
[3:49:42.700 --> 3:49:51.540]  known as I can't say the word but begins with a bull was the first part monetary method
[3:49:51.540 --> 3:50:06.740]  on rush to sovereign bond safety pushes negative yielding debt back to over 13 trillion dollars
[3:50:06.740 --> 3:50:15.740]  big investment companies hedge funds they want safe money so they're buying bonds they're
[3:50:15.740 --> 3:50:25.700]  paying no dividends you got it matter of fact you could buy a German one or a Japanese one
[3:50:25.700 --> 3:50:30.820]  you know 10 years out and you'll get less back than what you're bought it for that's
[3:50:30.820 --> 3:50:37.580]  how concerned people are you're putting their money into negative yielding funds because
[3:50:37.580 --> 3:50:46.500]  they know it's going to crash gold is that safe haven asset rather than getting a bond
[3:50:46.500 --> 3:50:53.380]  that pays a negative yield but you'll be happy to get your money back people are buying gold
[3:50:53.380 --> 3:51:01.620]  because they believe prices go up so in effect your yield is going up if gold goes up and
[3:51:01.620 --> 3:51:11.740]  my forecast and I am on record I will put my gold forecasting track record up against
[3:51:11.740 --> 3:51:17.940]  anybody anywhere in the world you have the video's you have the audio's you have the
[3:51:17.940 --> 3:51:26.380]  right written material from the trends journal on June 6 of 2019 we send a trend alert out
[3:51:26.380 --> 3:51:31.700]  to our subscribers and by the way there were no advertisements in the trends journal not
[3:51:31.700 --> 3:51:40.660]  on our website so I'm not advertising for anyone the headline was the gold bull run
[3:51:40.660 --> 3:51:54.900]  gold was at $1,332 an ounce back in June 2019 today around $1,580 an ounce I said gold would
[3:51:54.900 --> 3:52:02.180]  have to break over $1,450 for it to spike it had not done that for six years and that's
[3:52:02.180 --> 3:52:09.980]  how long I've been saying that I said at $1,332 it was going to break over that $1,450 mark
[3:52:09.980 --> 3:52:23.740]  in June it has and then I said if it goes below $1,550 an ounce the downside is $1,390
[3:52:23.740 --> 3:52:32.940]  hasn't gone below $1,550 an ounce so that's the way I say it the motto of the trends journals
[3:52:32.940 --> 3:52:41.380]  think for yourself so when you think for yourself you read again from the financial
[3:52:41.380 --> 3:52:47.060]  times and the writing is so small when you get old you know it's harder to read stuff
[3:52:47.060 --> 3:52:54.540]  and the printing is so small six euro zone banks have fallen below the euro European
[3:52:54.540 --> 3:53:04.580]  central banks capital requirements underlying the continued fragility of Europe's banking
[3:53:04.580 --> 3:53:13.820]  sector continuing fragility this is after they have pumped in some three trillion dollars
[3:53:13.820 --> 3:53:21.420]  worth of quantitative easing to juice the markets this is after they brought interest
[3:53:21.420 --> 3:53:37.540]  rates down to 0.5% and it's not boosting the markets number of distressed UK businesses
[3:53:37.540 --> 3:53:43.780]  hits record again this is this is two days worth of news here I'm going through this is
[3:53:43.780 --> 3:53:55.060]  what I do every day all different as I said sources almost ready 500,000 UK businesses
[3:53:55.060 --> 3:54:01.740]  that if you don't know are in significant financial distress the highest number recorded
[3:54:01.740 --> 3:54:15.820]  oh now they just did brexit stage right hey how about brexit the people got what they wanted
[3:54:15.820 --> 3:54:24.980]  isn't that great the people decided their future the people themselves decided their
[3:54:24.980 --> 3:54:35.380]  future good for the UK but then you got guys like George Soros have an article buried over
[3:54:35.380 --> 3:54:44.100]  here about how he's giving all this money because he's against countries trending toward
[3:54:44.100 --> 3:54:50.060]  nationalism in other words you're not allowed to hold on to your identity you have to be
[3:54:50.060 --> 3:55:11.060]  a globalized homogenize yep sorosize billionaire eyes so you can become a plantation worker
[3:55:11.060 --> 3:55:16.940]  on the global plantation of slave landia you don't want to be proud of the products you
[3:55:16.940 --> 3:55:26.500]  make you don't want to be thankful for who you are and where you were born and how fortunate
[3:55:26.500 --> 3:55:38.540]  you are or weren't I can live anywhere I want the world and for me King's town in uptown
[3:55:38.540 --> 3:55:47.780]  where I am in colonial Kingston in USA is my place of freedom direct democracy you're
[3:55:47.780 --> 3:55:53.260]  seeing it with brexit and remember this is going down before brexit they're gonna blame
[3:55:53.260 --> 3:56:05.220]  this on brexit it has nothing to do with it matter of fact if if smart nations become
[3:56:05.220 --> 3:56:11.020]  self-sustaining economies they can withstand the greatest oppression it's the only way
[3:56:11.020 --> 3:56:17.660]  out again I'm up here there's a lot of nice farms up here I got a north wind farms they
[3:56:17.660 --> 3:56:25.020]  get great chicken they make sausage from the from the pigs that they grow and they're
[3:56:25.020 --> 3:56:38.340]  not even a talent great guys and women by local by local by local by local by national
[3:56:38.340 --> 3:56:46.980]  by American build American this is the only way we're going to get through the greatest
[3:56:46.980 --> 3:56:55.100]  oppression we must become a self-sustaining economy and for our freedom we need direct
[3:56:55.100 --> 3:57:01.180]  democracy and for your freedom continue to support info wars put your money where your
[3:57:01.180 --> 3:57:11.500]  heart is trends journal the only magazine tells you what's going on what's next and
[3:57:11.500 --> 3:57:23.460]  what it means and occupy peace to bring liberty love joy and beauty to the USA who we are
[3:57:23.460 --> 3:57:31.500]  who we want to be how we want to stay who we are and not take orders from anybody else
[3:57:31.500 --> 3:57:37.340]  so again it is a real privilege for me to be here I support Alex Jones we don't agree
[3:57:37.340 --> 3:57:41.020]  on all topics who does but we're free to speak
