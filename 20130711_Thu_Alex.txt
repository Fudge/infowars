[00:00.000 --> 00:12.000]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.000 --> 00:38.000]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:38.000 --> 00:45.000]  all right my friends welcome thank you for joining us it is 7-eleven the 11th
[00:45.000 --> 00:53.360]  day of July 2013 on this Thursday edition and I've said this hundreds of
[00:53.360 --> 00:58.040]  times you've all heard it before one reason my show is a listenable is that
[00:58.040 --> 01:03.800]  I have quite a bit of dad a lot of research I know a lot of factoids also
[01:03.800 --> 01:09.880]  can be entertaining when I blow up and melt down on air but at the same time
[01:09.880 --> 01:14.200]  we have a lot of amazing guest and there is no radio consultant out there
[01:14.200 --> 01:17.600]  saying hey you want to do this you want to do that and in a way that's good but
[01:17.600 --> 01:24.440]  in a way it's bad because I know that overall even 10 years ago sometimes I
[01:24.440 --> 01:33.480]  probably generally did a better radio show than I do now now obviously in at
[01:33.480 --> 01:42.040]  points the broadcast is more informed by an order of several magnitude there are
[01:42.040 --> 01:49.560]  high points much higher than the type of info and understanding but also just
[01:49.560 --> 01:57.240]  good radio then I had 10 years ago overall we reach dizzying heights of
[01:57.240 --> 02:06.240]  awakening and flat-out entertainment so there are bigger diamonds but overall I
[02:06.240 --> 02:11.400]  would say less diamonds in the aggregate because I've been doing this so long I
[02:11.400 --> 02:22.960]  I I want to not degenerate instead of evolve and develop and get better and a
[02:22.960 --> 02:26.400]  lot of it is is that I really could care less what people think about me now
[02:26.400 --> 02:34.520]  completely I don't have as big an ego as I had 10 15 years ago where I would care
[02:34.520 --> 02:41.520]  about how I sounded or how I looked and people ask me all the time is your show
[02:41.520 --> 02:48.960]  real or isn't an act and I believe what I'm saying when I get mad it's real but
[02:48.960 --> 02:55.600]  I'm letting myself do it so does that make an enact it's real but there's an
[02:55.600 --> 03:02.760]  element to sure you know free will to to go wild on the air now now now quite
[03:02.760 --> 03:07.720]  frankly sometimes folks I go so wild that I'm really asking myself am I lying
[03:07.720 --> 03:14.320]  to myself just now wishing that I could say that I was in control maybe I'm not
[03:14.320 --> 03:22.280]  maybe I'm not you've heard me hundreds of times start the broadcast the last five
[03:22.280 --> 03:27.280]  years and say I really want to take a lot of calls today I mean even big shows
[03:27.280 --> 03:30.320]  are amazed when their phone lines load ladies and gentlemen I can turn on a
[03:30.320 --> 03:37.120]  computerized phone system and take 100 calls that will come in in just a minute
[03:38.240 --> 03:44.280]  most shows lean on the callers like a like a boxer leaning on the ropes or
[03:44.280 --> 03:52.240]  or holding the person they're boxing to rest with me it's the opposite it's more
[03:52.240 --> 04:01.480]  of a frenzied manic frothing kind of what's the right word for it berserk a
[04:01.480 --> 04:11.840]  berserking fits and starts train wreck I mean I can conduct the best radio
[04:11.840 --> 04:15.840]  interviews out there sound like Charlie Rose ask great questions sit back
[04:15.840 --> 04:20.200]  listen to the people come off I mean I can do it in English accent if I wanted
[04:20.200 --> 04:28.280]  to but I can't control myself I won't do it I could get up here and get calm
[04:28.280 --> 04:34.440]  like I am when I'm not on air and completely eloquently communicate
[04:34.440 --> 04:38.720]  things but then I get on air what I'm saying is I get on air and I'm like
[04:38.720 --> 04:47.720]  half the man I am off and so there is mega massive news but when I come back
[04:47.720 --> 04:54.360]  I'm gonna give the phone number out and I'm going to take 30 or 40 phone calls
[04:54.360 --> 04:56.960]  the next hour or I'm gonna have John Bowne punch me in the nose live on

[08:22.800 --> 08:29.480]  that's a good way to start the broadcast quoting at Thomas Jefferson it is
[08:29.480 --> 08:39.680]  7-eleven Thursday July 11th 2013 and here's what I want to do and I've said
[08:39.680 --> 08:43.120]  this many times and really never done it in the last few years but I do want to
[08:43.120 --> 08:47.440]  open the phones up right out of the start of the show very early on for your
[08:47.440 --> 08:52.080]  questions your comments if you agree you disagree first-time callers I was
[08:52.080 --> 08:54.840]  listening to a little bit of the rebroadcast last night when I got embedded
[08:54.840 --> 08:59.560]  about 11 o'clock at night and happened to hear a caller call in who I was a
[08:59.560 --> 09:04.720]  little bit rude to just because I get so irritated by all the news and what's
[09:04.720 --> 09:08.520]  happening and then you know the callers will ask me if they can talk about
[09:08.520 --> 09:12.360]  something and that's kind of my pet peeve you're on the air I mean you can
[09:12.360 --> 09:15.840]  come on and bring up whatever subject you want but still I was being a little
[09:15.840 --> 09:21.400]  bit rude with the gentleman and that's just my observations so I apologize it's
[09:21.400 --> 09:27.200]  not a personal thing this stuff really gets to me and and I get asked that a
[09:27.200 --> 09:32.640]  lot how do you handle it how does Alex Jones
[09:32.840 --> 09:40.720]  handle the pressure of reading the sin foe and studying the sin foe and then
[09:40.720 --> 09:45.280]  trying to talk about it and the answer is I really don't handle it I mean I
[09:45.280 --> 09:49.920]  guess it's almost a form of therapy once I've gone over all this news morning
[09:49.920 --> 09:54.440]  noon and night and then come on air but it's really almost like torture because
[09:54.440 --> 10:00.000]  each story I could spend an hour on just fleshing out here's an example from
[10:00.000 --> 10:02.480]  yesterday then I'll get to all the latest news we're gonna be covering and
[10:02.480 --> 10:05.160]  then give the number out and go to your calls and then second hour start getting
[10:05.160 --> 10:09.760]  into the news in depth because I want to shake the show up myself the broadcast
[10:09.760 --> 10:13.520]  is exploding it's getting all this attention and you know I tune in and
[10:13.520 --> 10:16.640]  listen to it sometimes and it's really informative and great and sounds like
[10:16.640 --> 10:20.160]  really professional radio other times it sounds like somebody released a
[10:20.160 --> 10:25.000]  gorilla on PCP from the New York Zoo or something but I mean look at this
[10:25.000 --> 10:28.240]  article this is why I freak out
[10:29.840 --> 10:37.960]  patient wakes up as doctors get ready to remove organs and then I am an expert
[10:37.960 --> 10:44.040]  on this from researching it for 23-4 years since I learned they were
[10:44.040 --> 10:48.600]  stealing organs because my dad rewired jaws and hospitals and things and said
[10:48.600 --> 10:52.560]  it was well-known they were they were killing people and then turned out Dallas
[10:52.560 --> 10:57.360]  hospitals were killing even healthy people for their organs and Chicago and
[10:57.360 --> 11:02.520]  and Austin I mean and Houston and New York I mean it's everywhere and it's
[11:02.520 --> 11:18.040]  only the naivete of the general public that allows this type of stuff to go on
[11:18.040 --> 11:22.680]  so there's an example if I start reading this on air and then start
[11:22.680 --> 11:27.800]  demonically laughing on purpose to try to illustrate to people how over the top
[11:27.800 --> 11:32.240]  this is because when you read the article it's like well the nurses told
[11:32.240 --> 11:36.720]  them she was alive and had good brainwaves and pulse and was responding
[11:36.720 --> 11:42.200]  to nerve stimulus and that she had just you know the woman had a prescription
[11:42.200 --> 11:47.440]  pill overdose and they should pump her stomach and give her charcoal and that
[11:47.440 --> 11:52.240]  she would be fine and the doctors said no we're taking her in to take her organs
[11:52.240 --> 12:00.920]  and by the grace of God as they began to prepare to do the opening incision
[12:00.920 --> 12:07.040]  cutting through her ribs busting her all open to take their time sucking her dry
[12:07.040 --> 12:10.600]  they even take the blood the marrow you know they are saying we ate the whole
[12:10.600 --> 12:14.880]  deal they can get half a mil if the organs are all in order half a mil and
[12:14.880 --> 12:22.240]  the doctors reportedly in some cases get as much as a third of the cash so you
[12:22.240 --> 12:27.200]  had a costly divorce you've got a lot of alimony you're paying child support you
[12:27.200 --> 12:35.200]  got a you know five million dollar house as a as a surgeon what do they call
[12:35.200 --> 12:42.560]  those that get the organs out and it just goes on and on but this is a living
[12:42.560 --> 12:50.000]  person what's an organ surgeon a thoracic surgeon let's look it up the point is
[12:50.000 --> 12:53.960]  is that you know you got a five million dollar house I mean you don't want to
[12:53.960 --> 12:57.320]  just make ten thousand dollars on a surgery I mean you want to make a hundred
[12:57.320 --> 13:02.920]  thousand two hundred thousand whatever and my dad was a dentist and oral surgeon
[13:02.920 --> 13:07.520]  and he just said it's well known in the medical community the doctors say to
[13:07.520 --> 13:13.880]  their families don't sign the organ donor card because a lot of hospitals if
[13:13.880 --> 13:19.840]  you come in unconscious I mean a knock on the head they're gonna kill you and
[13:19.840 --> 13:27.240]  you see they are the establishment wearing the white uniform like a cop
[13:27.240 --> 13:30.320]  wearing a blue or black uniform and so everyone bows down while you're the
[13:30.320 --> 13:37.200]  expert see medical tyranny's what Hitler went with first because he could get
[13:37.200 --> 13:42.920]  away with it because the people would bow down to it and follow orders from it
[13:42.920 --> 13:49.400]  and so just you know my frustration I've seen cases I mean there's a low
[13:49.400 --> 13:52.800]  probability these people are just idiots and didn't listen to the nurse and
[13:52.800 --> 13:57.040]  just decided to not you know get the pills out of her stomach or whatever and
[13:57.040 --> 14:00.800]  just decided to not administer the charcoal and just to suck it maybe we
[14:00.800 --> 14:05.720]  haven't won in a thousand in my opinion in my research educated view on this but
[14:05.720 --> 14:09.400]  we know all over the country they kill people and it's come out and again when
[14:09.400 --> 14:14.000]  I was 15 years old going to get my take driver's head and everything and I was
[14:14.000 --> 14:17.360]  taking drivers at school I was going to take the final test a few months before
[14:17.360 --> 14:25.720]  I was 16 and my dad was taking me there some days of you know for the for the
[14:25.720 --> 14:31.340]  after-school drivers exes also some after-school stuff driving classes
[14:31.340 --> 14:39.040]  whatever you call it and he told me listen don't sign that card and he said
[14:39.040 --> 14:43.040]  the doctors don't do it with their kids and their wives and their husbands I
[14:43.040 --> 14:48.320]  said why and he goes I've just been told that they will not not take care of you
[14:48.320 --> 14:53.160]  and I said what if you're brain dead he goes no I mean they're the word is
[14:53.160 --> 14:58.600]  they're killing healthy people and he said I'm just gonna leave it at that don't
[14:58.600 --> 15:02.400]  sign it so I did what he said and then later years later came on 60 minutes and
[15:02.400 --> 15:07.080]  stuff the point is you read this article and separate from them taking the
[15:07.080 --> 15:10.720]  organs from from people that could easily be saved and who aren't brain
[15:10.720 --> 15:17.080]  dead or even brain damaged just like it was a conspiracy theory in the news five
[15:17.080 --> 15:24.600]  years ago that Israel was grabbing detainees and then put them under and
[15:24.600 --> 15:29.080]  taking their organs turned out that was true you know first it was what Dutch
[15:29.080 --> 15:32.440]  newspapers and others that reported it when Israeli doctors blew the whistle
[15:32.440 --> 15:37.480]  and it was like oh any submitted conspiracy theory but then it turned out
[15:37.480 --> 15:41.440]  it was true they were taking the organs it's but see the media then tried to
[15:41.440 --> 15:47.320]  make it about oh you're saying you know Jews are inherently evil stealing
[15:47.320 --> 15:53.400]  organs when that wasn't even the issue corrupt governments and corrupt
[15:53.400 --> 16:01.160]  institutions all over the world traffic in organs children drugs weapons
[16:01.160 --> 16:12.720]  chemicals you name it and the public being chumps is what allows all this to
[16:12.720 --> 16:15.960]  happen and then you read the article and it's just like that New York Times
[16:15.960 --> 16:21.640]  article about Bayer shipped its riskier products overseas risky they knew it had
[16:21.640 --> 16:27.320]  HIV and hepatitis in the factory and shipped it into countries where they
[16:27.320 --> 16:31.480]  had already given political contributions like Canada and France and Australia
[16:31.480 --> 16:35.080]  and so they could get away with it and it came out they knew it was a death
[16:35.080 --> 16:39.360]  sentence they did it that's not risky if I go over and kill my neighbor it's not
[16:39.360 --> 16:44.360]  really it's not a real Alex did a risky thing no no that's a side diversion and
[16:44.360 --> 16:48.560]  it's like this ABC news article this is one article out of no exaggeration
[16:48.560 --> 16:55.040]  probably 200 on my desk all just as important it's all about oh it was this
[16:55.040 --> 16:59.000]  you know it was an accident but thank goodness she opened her eyes and then it
[16:59.000 --> 17:02.800]  was so human that it was like oh she opened her eyes this is too obvious and
[17:02.800 --> 17:09.840]  then they had to not cut her organs out and then it describes
[17:13.360 --> 17:18.160]  what went on it was exactly midnight when Colleen Burns eerily opened her eyes
[17:18.160 --> 17:23.000]  and looked at the orbiting lights above her shocked doctors who believed she was
[17:23.000 --> 17:30.320]  dead believe she was dead it goes on to say that the nurses told them heart
[17:30.320 --> 17:36.520]  heart rate everything she's right there get get so so see they're like oh they
[17:36.520 --> 17:40.840]  believe she was dead and we're about to remove her organs and donate them to
[17:40.840 --> 17:47.240]  patients on the transplant waiting list because they had the money the Syracuse
[17:47.240 --> 17:51.600]  post-standard unearthed a report see this stuff's all over the place it's just a
[17:51.600 --> 17:56.880]  report nothing's ever done from the US Department of Health and Human Services
[17:56.880 --> 18:02.160]  that's like Satan overseeing a low-level demon that chronicled the series of
[18:02.160 --> 18:06.880]  errors that led to the near organ removal of the living patient at St.
[18:06.880 --> 18:11.320]  Joseph Hospital Health Center in Syracuse New York in 2009 this just
[18:11.320 --> 18:19.200]  broke yesterday the patient does not suffer any type of arrest of the heart
[18:19.200 --> 18:25.760]  did not have irreversible brain damage the HHS report included the patient did
[18:25.760 --> 18:30.840]  not meet criteria for withdrawal of care so see once you're withdrawing care
[18:30.840 --> 18:34.440]  somebody's alive now we're gonna withdraw care and take their organs
[18:34.440 --> 18:38.520]  well now it's just we're just gonna take it even though you're alive and well
[18:38.520 --> 18:42.120]  you better hope you open your eyes accidentally we have to sedate them

[24:29.720 --> 24:33.800]  Justice Department found the media's paying attention organizing the Trayvon
[24:33.800 --> 24:39.160]  Martin protest trying to organize riots I guess to be a distraction from all of
[24:39.160 --> 24:46.360]  the big scandals that are racing around right now and the judge
[24:46.360 --> 24:52.160]  interfering unprecedented trying to prejudice the jury basically you've
[24:52.160 --> 24:57.320]  got the police chief saying they were pressured to basically arrest him even
[24:57.320 --> 25:00.280]  though they knew from all the witnesses that he had been assaulted and
[25:00.280 --> 25:04.200]  regardless what you think a Zimmerman this is a giant media diversion and
[25:04.200 --> 25:08.000]  they're trying to create division with it and Trayvon jumped on top of them beat
[25:08.000 --> 25:13.640]  the daylights out of it and but the point is it's just a mindless soap opera
[25:13.640 --> 25:18.640]  I'm gonna get into that I'm gonna get into some incredible medical news worms
[25:18.640 --> 25:22.840]  regrow their decapitated heads along with their memories which a lot of
[25:22.840 --> 25:27.280]  science shows is actually accurate I'm gonna break down what that really means
[25:27.280 --> 25:31.880]  folks your spinal cord is a continuation of your brain your stomach has brain type
[25:31.880 --> 25:35.920]  tissue in it it's not just this brain up here while you drink beer you get you
[25:35.920 --> 25:39.440]  know drunk up here of course the blood also picks up the alcohol and takes it
[25:39.440 --> 25:42.920]  up there but that's what autism is these kids are are poisoned by the
[25:42.920 --> 25:46.680]  pesticides and all the rest of it in the food but we're gonna be getting into
[25:46.680 --> 25:51.600]  that we're gonna get into William F. Jasper editor of the New Americans gonna
[25:51.600 --> 25:56.760]  be joining us transatlantic danger EU US merger talks underway in DC oh yeah
[25:56.760 --> 26:00.400]  that actually already happened back in 2007 but now they're going public with
[26:00.400 --> 26:05.040]  it we're gonna be breaking that down we're going to be getting into just a
[26:05.040 --> 26:09.160]  ton of news lawmaker demands the National Guard patrol the streets of
[26:09.160 --> 26:12.840]  Chicago to stop gun violence the truth is this already been going on for four
[26:12.840 --> 26:18.320]  years before blue blue Goyevitch got indicted he had already deployed them for
[26:18.320 --> 26:24.000]  about a week and and they're still there off and on we've confirmed but
[26:24.000 --> 26:27.960]  there's hardly ever any news coverage so this is just all part of take the
[26:27.960 --> 26:32.160]  citizens guns and only criminals have guns and the whole society collapses and
[26:32.160 --> 26:35.520]  then the government gets to bring in martial law which is why the
[26:35.520 --> 26:38.960]  establishment wants a disarmed chicken-necked population that can't defend
[26:38.960 --> 26:43.040]  itself that simple a psychology they want you dependent so that's coming up
[26:43.040 --> 26:48.320]  but but briefly back to this this New York case where a newspaper did its job
[26:48.320 --> 26:52.240]  and noticed a report where one of the nurses complained and pointed out they
[26:52.240 --> 26:56.480]  were putting this lady on a respirator who was coming out of it and that they
[26:56.480 --> 27:02.080]  just simply wanted to pump her stomach and try to you know get the drug
[27:02.080 --> 27:06.480]  overdose out of her stomach a multi-drug overdose according to the report
[27:06.480 --> 27:13.240]  and again people say why stick around a ventilator when they start taking the
[27:13.240 --> 27:16.880]  organs she's gonna die for real so you've got to have that going to take
[27:16.880 --> 27:22.880]  your time getting them so I thought I would play a little clip here from
[27:22.880 --> 27:30.160]  Monty Python what film is this I forget the meaning of life yeah yeah and this
[27:30.160 --> 27:33.520]  is basically it's satirical but this is how it works they come to the house
[27:33.520 --> 27:37.200]  force their way in say hey you got an organ donor card we're taking your
[27:37.200 --> 27:41.840]  organs now because see they need that consent up front and I'm not be
[27:41.840 --> 27:44.880]  forgiving organs if you die on a car wreck or something but you have a
[27:44.880 --> 27:48.760]  corrupt system and they will look the other way and in some cases outright
[27:48.760 --> 27:53.640]  kill you when when you go into the hospital they're already euthanizing
[27:53.640 --> 27:59.160]  people all over the world once you bring in socialist healthcare you know the
[27:59.160 --> 28:03.720]  case for killing granny cover of Newsweek let's go to the club
[28:30.160 --> 28:37.440]  what's this then I live with honest cad made we say more no I can't do it you
[28:37.440 --> 28:41.480]  know by the way the average person would not resist like this and would
[28:41.480 --> 28:44.880]  actually let them throw them on the thing and cut their liver out
[28:44.880 --> 29:00.200]  so it won't take a minute and see if the nurses in New York wouldn't have done something this has been
[29:00.200 --> 29:16.200]  there the wife comes in she's totally calm people are pretty calm about this

[38:01.440 --> 38:04.680]  love your show gonna get right to the point you're mentioning about pet peeves
[38:04.680 --> 38:09.840]  so I figured I'd call in and let you know one of mine first of all don't
[38:09.840 --> 38:16.040]  censor your rent because what your rents actually are Alex is emotional analysis
[38:16.040 --> 38:20.480]  which all of us need to have because we don't have the expertise of sifting
[38:20.480 --> 38:25.240]  through all this information like you do okay it annoys me when you censor
[38:25.240 --> 38:29.200]  yourself in the middle of an informative entertaining rant to go to some
[38:29.200 --> 38:32.960]  meathead who gets on there and doesn't even know he's on the air okay that's
[38:32.960 --> 38:38.560]  annoying so a quick little suggestion schedule that calls for half an hour the
[38:38.560 --> 38:42.320]  first hour do all your news the first half hour the news you don't get to go
[38:42.320 --> 38:46.160]  back the second hour if you don't have a guest but please do not censor your
[38:46.160 --> 38:51.280]  rancher informative and they're entertaining no I hear you the rancher
[38:51.280 --> 38:56.280]  painful for me though I mean when I'm up there freaking out and and and really
[38:56.280 --> 39:02.560]  trying to illustrate how corrupt the tyranny is it's like a person in a cage
[39:02.560 --> 39:05.840]  being lowered into the water who knows they're gonna drown I mean I know how
[39:05.840 --> 39:10.720]  real this is I know my life's in danger I know this isn't a game and the most
[39:10.720 --> 39:15.080]  annoying question I get is do you really believe all of this and the people
[39:15.080 --> 39:19.680]  get mad at me when I go no I don't believe it okay it's all made up the
[39:19.680 --> 39:23.240]  world's great blah blah blah you're being sarcastic of course I believe what
[39:23.240 --> 39:27.720]  I'm saying they go well is it an act well I mean that's like saying if I go to
[39:27.720 --> 39:31.160]  a football game and get excited about my team scoring is an act I mean I'm
[39:31.160 --> 39:37.760]  letting myself be emotional so it isn't an act but it is an act but I've come
[39:37.760 --> 39:42.120]  to realization is that I'm actually not in control anymore myself and I've
[39:42.120 --> 39:46.440]  realized that I've gotten more and more angry and more and more reckless as well
[39:46.440 --> 39:50.600]  just out on the street and things with bureaucrats police you name it I'm just
[39:50.600 --> 39:55.440]  getting to the point where it's all just a fraud and I have trouble playing
[39:55.440 --> 40:00.120]  along with their fraud when a cop pulls me over and says mind if I search the
[40:00.120 --> 40:03.320]  vehicle I'm just like man you really want your kids living in a total
[40:03.320 --> 40:08.440]  tyranny our kids have nothing to do with it well cops didn't used to do this in
[40:08.440 --> 40:12.040]  America I was brought up this is done in tyrannies you know how would you like it
[40:12.040 --> 40:15.900]  if I asked to search your car get out of the vehicle you know it's just a bad
[40:15.900 --> 40:20.480]  nightmare we know where this leads we know where this is going and that's
[40:20.480 --> 40:26.600]  why I'm freaking out I appreciate your call Jim oh I just I'll be honest with
[40:26.600 --> 40:31.560]  you I look at my innocent children they were reading some children's comedy book
[40:31.560 --> 40:38.840]  my ten-year-old son was about a bad-behaved hippopotamus this morning
[40:38.840 --> 40:42.640]  and he was reading passages from it and my five-year-old my nine-year-old was
[40:42.640 --> 40:46.360]  just giggling and rolling around the ground and it was like painful how good
[40:46.360 --> 40:51.520]  they are it was painful how innocent they are it was painful how corrupt the
[40:51.520 --> 40:54.360]  world is and then I started hearing that thing about oh I don't want to bring
[40:54.360 --> 40:57.000]  children into the world and I'm always like we've got to fight we got to bring
[40:57.000 --> 40:59.920]  them into the world since we're good people and that's the experience our
[40:59.920 --> 41:04.120]  ancestors kept having kids even though it was bad and that's true we have more
[41:04.120 --> 41:08.040]  responsibility to have the children and then fight for them because I noticed if
[41:08.040 --> 41:11.560]  you don't have the kids you tend on average should not fight as hard for
[41:11.560 --> 41:15.160]  freedom and again that's an overgeneralization but people are like
[41:15.160 --> 41:18.760]  yeah I just take care of myself so what once you have those children or at least
[41:18.760 --> 41:23.720]  empathize with nieces or nephews people you care about it's good to have some
[41:23.720 --> 41:27.560]  family not even so much even children so that you've got skin in the game
[41:27.560 --> 41:32.080]  because it's easy as a man or a woman to just go all the whole world's going to
[41:32.080 --> 41:35.560]  hell in a handbasket nothing's gonna change it I'm gonna just go eat drink
[41:35.560 --> 41:40.160]  and be merry or I'll just become corrupt and sell people out and you know people
[41:40.160 --> 41:42.880]  been playing dirty with me I'll play dirty with them and see how they like it
[41:42.880 --> 41:49.240]  but civilization everything good is based in not selling out because
[41:49.240 --> 41:52.760]  everybody else did but it's not enough to just be good and hard-working and
[41:52.760 --> 41:57.760]  put up with the corruption you've got to not sell out and not be corrupt and
[41:57.760 --> 42:01.040]  try to be as moral as you can and then not beat yourself up when you make
[42:01.040 --> 42:05.240]  mistakes see good people are always beating themselves up evil aren't you
[42:05.240 --> 42:11.520]  know you're good you know you love God and justice move forward but at the
[42:11.520 --> 42:18.440]  same time wage war on corrupt people do whatever you have to and that's what's
[42:18.440 --> 42:25.360]  fulfilling in life and I need to get out more on the street I really I need to go
[42:25.360 --> 42:29.280]  to the urban warfare drills again I need to go out and go up to police and say I
[42:29.280 --> 42:33.100]  like to search your vehicle to show them freak out and go well you want to
[42:33.100 --> 42:38.000]  search my without a warrant I need to do all the things I've got thousands of
[42:38.000 --> 42:42.300]  plans all of them will work every the problem is I can't manifest it all and
[42:42.300 --> 42:45.640]  I don't have enough money to hire enough people and then enough people to train
[42:45.640 --> 42:49.800]  so they understand so we can carry this out I know how to beat the New World
[42:49.800 --> 42:54.160]  Order you do as well a lot of you it's historical it's an understanding and to
[42:54.160 --> 43:02.440]  have the right stuff and to know the enemy's plans it's unbelievable it is
[43:02.440 --> 43:14.760]  unbelievable to just see people programmed and under globalist control
[43:14.760 --> 43:20.680]  and thinking they're winning going along with the system designed to
[43:20.680 --> 43:27.120]  irrevocably wreck human society as an exit all the literature of the
[43:27.120 --> 43:29.520]  establishment is they're going to build a technological
[43:29.520 --> 43:33.480]  landopolis with a bunch of control freaks running around backed up by drones
[43:33.480 --> 43:37.240]  and robots and they're going to break up our families and persecute us and
[43:37.240 --> 43:43.520]  stomp on our face with a black boot forever the small amounts of us that
[43:43.520 --> 43:47.200]  are basically left to be toyed with and messed with and tortured forever I mean
[43:47.200 --> 43:52.920]  it's just unbelievable we are turning the world over to look Ray Kurzweil said
[43:52.920 --> 43:56.320]  he doesn't believe in God yet that he's gonna become God merging with the
[43:56.320 --> 44:00.920]  machines let me take that statement even if you don't believe in God and
[44:00.920 --> 44:05.320]  don't believe in the devil the the establishment is trying to become the
[44:05.320 --> 44:10.480]  devil they act just like the biblical devil the devil of every culture they
[44:10.480 --> 44:15.400]  do the same thing there's a reason we've heard of this before and they want to be
[44:15.400 --> 44:19.840]  the devil Ray Kurzweil doesn't believe in God yet he's gonna become God no he's
[44:19.840 --> 44:24.600]  gonna become the devil if he can it's a race to become the devil it's a race to
[44:24.600 --> 44:30.240]  build a godlike structure for these psychopaths to basically become God in
[44:30.240 --> 44:35.440]  their own words it is madness ladies and gentlemen and I'm staring at them I
[44:35.440 --> 44:40.520]  know their mind I know their taste I can see them and I'm sitting here in the
[44:40.520 --> 44:44.760]  middle of a horror movie ladies and gentlemen I know right down the street
[44:44.760 --> 44:47.520]  they're killing people for their organs I know people they've killed for their
[44:47.520 --> 44:50.960]  organs here in Austin nobody's gonna prosecute them they got foster kids all
[44:50.960 --> 44:54.840]  over the country right now feeding them pesticides and drugs testing them at
[44:54.840 --> 44:58.760]  facilities they're gonna kill them and then cut their bodies up when they're
[44:58.760 --> 45:02.920]  done and nobody's gonna help them you're not gonna help them we're all going to
[45:02.920 --> 45:07.600]  hell man I'm telling you I'm telling you Nazi Germany is nothing compared to
[45:07.600 --> 45:10.720]  what's going on now it's going on everywhere that's creeping around behind
[45:10.720 --> 45:14.800]  the scenes and evil is just metastasizing I said I take your calls see I
[45:14.800 --> 45:19.520]  can't do it this is another scientific test I am not in control let's talk to
[45:19.520 --> 45:26.480]  Meryl in California you're on the air go ahead Alex good talk to you listen you
[45:26.480 --> 45:31.320]  were talking earlier about the organs you know government cropping our organs
[45:31.320 --> 45:35.400]  I read an article this week on Facebook that was floating around and they said
[45:35.400 --> 45:39.400]  that there were 1000 internment camps FEMA camps whatever you want to call them
[45:39.400 --> 45:42.800]  they changed their name every time you know once everybody wakes up about it
[45:42.800 --> 45:45.360]  they change the name and then they say oh no that's we don't have none of that
[45:45.360 --> 45:50.480]  the emergency centers establishment act and they also hide it under they also
[45:50.480 --> 45:55.520]  hide it under the civilian inmate labor camp program but yeah they're building
[45:55.520 --> 46:00.520]  them all over the place well the article said this week that there were 1000 of
[46:00.520 --> 46:05.040]  those internment camps in the United States and Obama had recently purchased
[46:05.040 --> 46:10.400]  30,000 guillotines yeah that's an urban legend that's an urban legend that's
[46:10.400 --> 46:14.560]  racing through everything right now and then people listening on the inside no
[46:14.560 --> 46:17.680]  that's not true and it discredits things and I'm not mad that you brought it up
[46:17.680 --> 46:24.520]  I'm glad you brought it up but that's an obsession for movies in the 80s where
[46:24.520 --> 46:28.600]  the anti-crisis gonna cut people's heads off and I'm sure governments do stuff
[46:28.600 --> 46:31.840]  like that you know they'll hire a whole group to go into an African country a
[46:31.840 --> 46:35.560]  neighboring African group to kill everybody with machetes and chop their
[46:35.560 --> 46:39.680]  heads off they've got Al Qaeda chopping people's heads off all over Syria and
[46:39.680 --> 46:44.540]  all over Egypt right now with video of it but none of the Christian groups will
[46:44.540 --> 46:47.480]  hardly talk about it they just talk about guillotines that fell out of a
[46:47.480 --> 46:51.840]  truck you know it's always a different town different city and it may have a
[46:51.840 --> 46:58.280]  root in reality somewhere but there's all the proven real stuff that is going
[46:58.280 --> 47:01.040]  on I mean they don't have to chop your head off with a guillotine they chop
[47:01.040 --> 47:06.160]  your intellect out with with hydrofluorosalic acid here's my theory
[47:06.160 --> 47:11.120]  behind this if they chop your head off Alex they can stick pipes down in your
[47:11.120 --> 47:16.600]  throat and keep you alive until your organs are propped well that is a big
[47:16.600 --> 47:23.000]  part of it but well look they have mobile execution vans dozens of them in
[47:23.000 --> 47:26.720]  every Chinese city and they'll just on the spot if they need somebody just
[47:26.720 --> 47:29.680]  kidnap them cut their organs out on the spot this is on record by the way and
[47:29.680 --> 47:33.600]  and and and people from the US flying to Japan and China because they shipped
[47:33.600 --> 47:40.720]  over to Japan it's a few hours and and do the surgeries there so I mean that
[47:40.720 --> 47:45.600]  stuff is going on but they just put you under they keep you alive and then they
[47:45.600 --> 47:49.960]  harvest everything and then they take the heart last I appreciate you calling
[47:49.960 --> 47:54.840]  in but no one talks about what's real no one talks about Pepsi with fetal tissue
[47:54.840 --> 48:00.040]  in it it's a fact and yeah there's a Daily Mail China's high-tech death
[48:00.040 --> 48:03.760]  van where criminals are executed and their organs are sold on black market
[48:03.760 --> 48:13.480]  well even the media goes with their criminals I mean here in the US they
[48:13.480 --> 48:18.760]  there they don't care they just kill you outright and they do organ harvesting and
[48:18.760 --> 48:23.200]  sports stadiums for everybody as well you pull that up you want to see it just
[48:23.200 --> 48:28.720]  the public so naive let's go to Peter in Florida you're on the air Peter go
[48:28.720 --> 48:32.400]  ahead hey how's it going out brother just going on about what you're saying
[48:32.400 --> 48:36.080]  that you know becoming up the change with whatever skill you have I'm an
[48:36.080 --> 48:40.760]  artist here in Miami and did a video with we are change and Luke Rikowski just
[48:40.760 --> 48:45.360]  posted it up on on YouTube just check it out so what I do is I go to these
[48:45.360 --> 48:49.600]  comic book conventions and I do artwork dealing with like 9-11 and the TSA and
[48:49.600 --> 48:54.360]  drones and all that kind of stuff and I put it out in a way that is favorable or
[48:54.360 --> 48:58.000]  it's aesthetically similar to a lot of the other pop culture stuff like when
[48:58.000 --> 49:01.560]  you post the reviews of the different movies and stuff I sell out of them
[49:01.560 --> 49:05.160]  they're super popular we have conversations from everything from the
[49:05.160 --> 49:09.360]  police state to economics on a comic book convention showing how you know
[49:09.360 --> 49:13.800]  that what we have to do is we have to hijack the culture of evil and then
[49:13.800 --> 49:19.280]  infuse life into it hijack their images which is totally legal and lawful as
[49:19.280 --> 49:23.240]  long as it's a parody of it and and hijacked their movies hijacked their
[49:23.240 --> 49:28.960]  TV shows and use their shows to show you the programming but also use good art
[49:28.960 --> 49:32.880]  that comes out of the establishment to praise that and that's one reason you're
[49:32.880 --> 49:36.760]  seeing a little bit of positive stuff out there now is because Hollywood can't
[49:36.760 --> 49:41.440]  sell pure negativity people want wholesome good stuff they want the Bible
[49:41.440 --> 49:46.280]  on Discovery Channel or History Channel they want something like Superman
[49:46.280 --> 49:51.840]  that's pro father pro family anti-terranny anti eugenics people hunger for
[49:51.840 --> 49:54.960]  liberty and so there's a dichotomy that's what the globalists say they want to get
[49:54.960 --> 50:00.080]  rid of the globalist they want to get rid of the real free market only have a
[50:00.080 --> 50:03.760]  centralized group because they're always getting beaten by the free market by the
[50:03.760 --> 50:08.400]  choices you make like organic nobody could get organic 20 years ago now it's
[50:08.400 --> 50:12.800]  supplanting all the poison garbage and getting cheaper because more people are
[50:12.800 --> 50:16.440]  coming into the market and we're out producing them so they're getting angry
[50:16.440 --> 50:20.600]  so God bless you tell us tell us the name of the video yeah it's on we are
[50:20.600 --> 50:24.960]  changes libertarian artists art imitating life it shows people right there
[50:24.960 --> 50:28.760]  buying this giant poster that put out really popular it's a captain America
[50:28.760 --> 50:31.800]  head of vintage looking one and underneath it it just says 9-11 was an
[50:31.800 --> 50:35.440]  inside job it's kind of tongue-in-cheeked the people love fantastic listen
[50:35.440 --> 50:39.000]  since it's one sinister art we might hang it up in the new studios we're

[54:39.480 --> 54:45.880]  coming on about 95% of the time it tends to happen for me personally this guest
[54:45.880 --> 54:50.320]  that we got contacted through over some tyrannical abuses they went through for
[54:50.320 --> 54:55.200]  me it's about as big a guess you can get on was the person such an icon and is
[54:55.200 --> 54:59.480]  also so old it's kind of like Kurt Vonnegut I learned was a listener had
[54:59.480 --> 55:03.200]  his hands to talk to him a couple times he sent me some of his own art and
[55:03.200 --> 55:07.400]  personalized and he said oh I'm too old nobody wants to hear from me but I
[55:07.400 --> 55:11.400]  appreciate your work I'm like mr. Vonnegut please please he was no listen I
[55:11.400 --> 55:14.800]  respect what you're doing I'm done and then like a month later saw him do his
[55:14.800 --> 55:18.760]  last university speech at his alma mater and he said I will never be heard from
[55:18.760 --> 55:22.480]  again goodbye and then six months later fell down at his head in New York and
[55:22.480 --> 55:26.600]  was dead and I mean I've read like almost all of Kurt Vonnegut's books I was
[55:26.600 --> 55:29.400]  reading those when I was a teenager my parents were big fans they were laying
[55:29.400 --> 55:33.880]  around it's just amazing satire and so much of it has come true I've even read
[55:33.880 --> 55:37.720]  like I bought a book of his essays that were in newspapers and magazines short
[55:37.720 --> 55:42.680]  stories he wrote really good stuff like he wrote stuff about like astronauts
[55:42.680 --> 55:45.680]  finally go to space he wrote this like at the end of World War two and it's
[55:45.680 --> 55:48.920]  actually where all the ghosts are at it's like hell's everybody is he wrote a
[55:48.920 --> 55:53.240]  lot of cool stuff and it's just like I never got Kurt Vonnegut on the year and
[55:53.240 --> 56:00.080]  this person is like the living John Wayne but then they wanted to come on with
[56:00.080 --> 56:02.960]  their lawyer then the lawyers like well I can't do it because I'm going to town
[56:02.960 --> 56:06.080]  for a week and then it's all like it's lawyers man they get in the way of
[56:06.080 --> 56:08.680]  everything it doesn't even matter it doesn't is the person's gonna come on
[56:08.680 --> 56:13.760]  about corruption too wasn't just gonna be a famous person on so it's Taylor made
[56:13.760 --> 56:18.840]  to wake people up but we'll see if it happens it's just it's it's by the way
[56:18.840 --> 56:22.720]  we have Sergeant Big's popping I'm not going to overdrive today for about 20
[56:22.720 --> 56:26.720]  minutes with him he wants to come on and talk about the cover up of his buddy
[56:26.720 --> 56:31.000]  Michael Hastings so we're gonna be looking at all of that and I'm not
[56:31.000 --> 56:38.000]  bragging about Kurt Vonnegut it's just like I have a framed Kurt Vonnegut you
[56:38.000 --> 56:43.900]  know for Alex to Alex lithograph print he did shined by him of an empty bird
[56:43.900 --> 56:50.440]  cage you know I the Libertah the symbol of universal freedom and he's dead now
[56:50.440 --> 56:57.200]  but at least I got to talk to him you know it's going hey I got to know
[56:57.200 --> 57:00.240]  Charlton Hesse a little bit well people know that's true because there's a
[57:00.240 --> 57:04.480]  couple interviews there but it isn't about I knew Charlton Hesse and it was
[57:04.480 --> 57:09.560]  what a good human he was and it's just something about talking to people and
[57:09.560 --> 57:16.000]  they're really old and they're still all there but then they're gone forever then
[57:16.000 --> 57:22.480]  they're gone forever I'm gonna go to break and come back and and then we're
[57:22.480 --> 57:26.440]  gonna try it again for 30 minutes call straight I took a couple when I come
[57:26.440 --> 57:33.560]  back I'm gonna just take call after call after call 800 259 92 31 you hear a
[57:33.560 --> 57:37.360]  caller hang up I'm gonna go to you just just coming up and then I'm gonna get
[57:37.360 --> 57:42.200]  into the whole Zimmerman thing you know I wasn't ever on the fence because the
[57:42.200 --> 57:44.960]  witnesses saying that Trayvon attacked him but I thought Zimmerman was stupid
[57:44.960 --> 57:47.720]  to go following a guy around with a gun I mean I'd probably get mad what are you
[57:47.720 --> 57:53.200]  doing following around with a gun but you look at Trayvon's past and being sent
[57:53.200 --> 57:57.000]  you know to his father and the trouble he was in and the gangster photos out
[57:57.000 --> 58:00.760]  there and the media showing the 12 year old kid not the 17 year old you know
[58:00.760 --> 58:05.000]  kid or whatever and and and then the Justice Department pressuring the
[58:05.000 --> 58:09.720]  police to you know go after Zimmerman and all this stuff they're trying to set
[58:09.720 --> 58:14.520]  Zimmerman and that's an injustice and now the judge is slapping him around and
[58:14.520 --> 58:17.800]  stuff and I mean it's just unprecedented what's going on now they're
[58:17.800 --> 58:20.960]  talking about child abuse to go after Zimmerman you know get him on something
[58:20.960 --> 58:26.680]  and lesser charge of manslaughter so they can get him on that I mean it is
[58:26.680 --> 58:32.320]  just incredible and NPR this morning I was you know calling him a racist period
[58:32.320 --> 58:39.520]  I mean just the they want to stir up total racial hatred in this country

[01:00:31.200 --> 01:00:37.120]  head I look at the judge in the Trayvon Martin Zimmerman case and I just imagine
[01:00:37.120 --> 01:00:42.440]  like stink the smell of a public bathroom I don't I don't know I was just
[01:00:42.440 --> 01:00:45.880]  looking at her and I was watching a video of her during the break before
[01:00:45.880 --> 01:00:49.440]  last and it's just like you know that overwhelming drive did not want to be
[01:00:49.440 --> 01:00:53.960]  around somebody it's not that she's an older woman a little bit overweight I
[01:00:53.960 --> 01:00:58.880]  don't care how she looks it's like the spirit of her the the weak power trip
[01:00:58.880 --> 01:01:05.600]  what do you call somebody that finishes last at the the bottom of their their
[01:01:05.600 --> 01:01:11.200]  law school classes you call them your honor your honor these people aren't
[01:01:11.200 --> 01:01:15.600]  honorable they're dishonorable we're gonna be talking about that judge in
[01:01:15.600 --> 01:01:20.760]  Zimmerman case pressured by Obama administration bizarre outburst against
[01:01:20.760 --> 01:01:29.040]  Zimmerman suggest prejudice that's right judicial prejudice there's many
[01:01:29.040 --> 01:01:33.280]  types of prejudice folks not just about race or religion or region real
[01:01:33.280 --> 01:01:36.680]  prejudice is usually economic you know where the bankers are above the law and
[01:01:36.680 --> 01:01:40.360]  don't pay taxes stuff like that and then lobby to have your taxes raised you
[01:01:40.360 --> 01:01:43.320]  know real prejudice that's why they want to divert you all day with what
[01:01:43.320 --> 01:01:47.960]  color somebody's skin is until racist groups are coming after you and you have
[01:01:47.960 --> 01:01:53.760]  to respond to them racially they force you into this and it goes they play all
[01:01:53.760 --> 01:01:56.720]  different angles all different sides of it is just unbelievable let's go to phone
[01:01:56.720 --> 01:02:01.320]  calls and then I'll get into all that news Nick in Australia the land down under
[01:02:01.320 --> 01:02:06.720]  you got some big bunny rabbits over there buddy how are you good sir welcome
[01:02:06.720 --> 01:02:11.200]  thank you for holding no worries I just really wanted to quickly talk about I
[01:02:11.200 --> 01:02:15.880]  guess the things from an education point of view for listeners and China
[01:02:15.880 --> 01:02:20.080]  suppose open people's eyes up you've been touching on it a lot lately
[01:02:20.080 --> 01:02:26.360]  referring to the police and other government agencies organized crime
[01:02:26.360 --> 01:02:31.280]  really good article that's worth reading by Charles Tilly what we're making in
[01:02:31.280 --> 01:02:35.960]  state making is organized crime I think it really sums it up and just helps
[01:02:35.960 --> 01:02:39.960]  people better yeah I think I've read references out of that book
[01:02:39.960 --> 01:02:45.800]  what's the name again it's war-making and state-making as organized crime it's
[01:02:45.800 --> 01:02:49.680]  just a scholarly article it's not actually a book that's why I thought I'd
[01:02:49.680 --> 01:02:53.160]  read that yeah I've read it war-making and state-making and that's why I was
[01:02:53.160 --> 01:02:58.080]  saying I'd read excerpts I guess the point I'm really trying to make is just
[01:02:58.080 --> 01:03:01.640]  I suppose I try to open as many people's eyes as possible but people are reluctant
[01:03:01.640 --> 01:03:06.240]  to think of things as the conspiracy theory type of stuff so I try to well
[01:03:06.240 --> 01:03:10.640]  it's basically like telling a kid don't worry there's no bad men in the world
[01:03:10.640 --> 01:03:14.680]  you're lying to them the public believes in Santa Claus but doesn't believe in
[01:03:14.680 --> 01:03:18.240]  tyranny when it's the history of the world and they're like huh you're saying
[01:03:18.240 --> 01:03:22.400]  there's powerful groups do bad things haha so ridiculous I mean it's like
[01:03:22.400 --> 01:03:29.040]  saying this guy says the Sun came up tell me another one oh man that's crazy so I
[01:03:29.040 --> 01:03:33.720]  guess another couple of really good websites when I found just really sums
[01:03:33.720 --> 01:03:38.120]  up the history of the Rothschild family it's a really good one for people I
[01:03:38.120 --> 01:03:43.560]  guess aren't as educated and just people that are interested in history if they
[01:03:43.560 --> 01:03:47.160]  read this there's a lot of historical facts that are in there sure what's the
[01:03:47.160 --> 01:03:54.480]  site it's called I am the witness dot com and it's just it's got the French
[01:03:54.480 --> 01:03:57.360]  connection and the history of the house of Rothschild and it sort of starts
[01:03:57.360 --> 01:04:02.520]  probably at the very beginning very very very interesting alright well thank you
[01:04:02.520 --> 01:04:08.840]  so much for that call from Australia and we're going to go to we come back from

[01:08:36.200 --> 01:08:40.640]  gonna continue with phone calls and the grab bag wildcard different issues you
[01:08:40.640 --> 01:08:44.120]  raise then I'm gonna get into the Zimmerman case because you know I've not
[01:08:44.120 --> 01:08:48.160]  talked about this as much as other shows it's a very hot topic articles we write
[01:08:48.160 --> 01:08:54.240]  about it get you know 7,000 comments instead of 500 articles we write about
[01:08:54.240 --> 01:08:58.040]  it get some of them a million readers instead of our average article getting
[01:08:58.040 --> 01:09:05.240]  20,000 readers I mean it's crazy and Watson's been following it and so is
[01:09:05.240 --> 01:09:08.840]  rest my crew just because now it's obvious they're trying to railroad
[01:09:08.840 --> 01:09:16.760]  Zimmerman and the idiots out there that gets so racially programmed that because
[01:09:16.760 --> 01:09:21.120]  when I've covered this I get emails I get calls from white liberals black folks
[01:09:21.120 --> 01:09:25.040]  you name it going you must be a racist you know that that cracker head you know
[01:09:25.040 --> 01:09:28.520]  as an idiot blah blah blah look Zimmerman they had a bunch of break-ins in
[01:09:28.520 --> 01:09:36.120]  the area and you see a young guy with a hood on nowadays people get paranoid and
[01:09:36.120 --> 01:09:40.280]  I wouldn't have followed him around with a gun and it was it was stupid he was
[01:09:40.280 --> 01:09:44.640]  negligent but they're they're now coming after him for child abuse folks they're
[01:09:44.640 --> 01:09:48.560]  now trying to lessen the charge down the manslaughter because it's clear that
[01:09:48.560 --> 01:09:52.680]  there's all these witnesses that he was on top of and beating him and and you
[01:09:52.680 --> 01:09:58.160]  know screaming the n-word at Zimmerman and then the media Zimmerman looks looks
[01:09:58.160 --> 01:10:03.720]  really Asian to me and not even so much Hispanic but he is you know his dad's
[01:10:03.720 --> 01:10:10.120]  white as you call it and my whole issue is I mean I've really started to follow
[01:10:10.120 --> 01:10:15.280]  it and look at it and this is crazy the police chief says we were basically
[01:10:15.280 --> 01:10:20.440]  ordered to arrest him and said and you know set him up the police chiefs out
[01:10:20.440 --> 01:10:26.200]  admitting that left over it because he had a conscience we're now got all these
[01:10:26.200 --> 01:10:31.160]  witnesses that that that Trayvon jumped on top of him and the judge is
[01:10:31.160 --> 01:10:35.880]  excoriating him and trying to tell him what to do versus his lawyers that's a
[01:10:35.880 --> 01:10:40.680]  mistrial folks when the judge gets involved with the client and their
[01:10:40.680 --> 01:10:47.400]  lawyers and the judge acts like this this is this is a mistrial this is this
[01:10:47.400 --> 01:10:53.800]  is a miscarriage of judge ship and all the lawyers are saying wow we've never
[01:10:53.800 --> 01:10:58.200]  seen this before well that's because I've done a little bit of studying just the
[01:10:58.200 --> 01:11:05.200]  basic law and the judge is prejudice the case is what it's called and it's a
[01:11:05.200 --> 01:11:09.880]  mistrial right there you're about mistrals all the time it's because they
[01:11:09.880 --> 01:11:16.120]  allow in evidence that isn't true or was inadmissible or the prosecutor goes
[01:11:16.120 --> 01:11:21.760]  too far and make something up or or might be made up I mean it's it's a done
[01:11:21.760 --> 01:11:27.280]  deal and now this judge is saying hey we can go to manslaughter now because you
[01:11:27.280 --> 01:11:37.160]  know it's going to be hard to get the murder it's just unbelievable this is
[01:11:37.160 --> 01:11:41.800]  unbelievable that that they want to put him in jail and you've got the justice
[01:11:41.800 --> 01:11:46.400]  department on record running around well I said I covered the bottom they are I've
[01:11:46.400 --> 01:11:49.360]  got like three stacks of news I want to go over systematically and get all the
[01:11:49.360 --> 01:11:53.920]  facts exactly straight but they are railroading this guy it turns out his
[01:11:53.920 --> 01:11:58.960]  best friend is black it turns out you know a bunch of his family or Hispanic
[01:11:58.960 --> 01:12:04.720]  and on the police force and they calling Jorge and notice the media NPR this
[01:12:04.720 --> 01:12:10.560]  morning said our reporter John bound wrote it down when he heard it this
[01:12:10.560 --> 01:12:16.400]  morning they said George Zimmerman is a racist sure he has a Hispanic mother
[01:12:16.400 --> 01:12:21.480]  but he's a white Hispanic it's like well he's white so he's bad and there's all
[01:12:21.480 --> 01:12:25.800]  these racial murders of whites where you know 11-year-old kid a black lady
[01:12:25.800 --> 01:12:29.760]  grabs him for no reason and ties him up and kills him with a blowtorch over an
[01:12:29.760 --> 01:12:35.720]  hour burning his eyeballs down and that's not racial attack or black guys
[01:12:35.720 --> 01:12:40.560]  drag a white bum to death and it doesn't even make the news but a black guy gets
[01:12:40.560 --> 01:12:44.480]  drugged to death and it's international news and all this and again it's all
[01:12:44.480 --> 01:12:50.240]  about keeping blacks and Hispanics and others in a racial paradigm with the
[01:12:50.240 --> 01:12:54.840]  Democratic Party where that's the group that represents them to see before the
[01:12:54.840 --> 01:12:59.920]  Democratic Party represented the the the racist sections of the south and that
[01:12:59.920 --> 01:13:03.360]  was it and the cook close clan the cook was clan had
[01:13:03.360 --> 01:13:11.480]  was it 300,000 clansmen marchers famous photos in the 20s to DC I mean senator
[01:13:11.480 --> 01:13:15.480]  Byrd was elected as a grand dragon
[01:13:15.480 --> 01:13:22.280]  so so they looked at demographics they always had done things racially so they
[01:13:22.280 --> 01:13:25.600]  looked at the demographics and they said okay well now we'll just bring in all
[01:13:25.600 --> 01:13:29.640]  these other groups make them racial we'll even have the Ford Foundation fund them
[01:13:29.640 --> 01:13:33.240]  and call it Raza which means the race and you look at these black groups these
[01:13:33.240 --> 01:13:37.080]  Hispanic groups they are Hispanic and black cook class plan it is the exact
[01:13:37.080 --> 01:13:44.080]  same tribal all that clan means is is is a tribal group I saw articles when
[01:13:44.080 --> 01:13:49.680]  they're talking about taking references to Scottish clans out in textbooks
[01:13:49.680 --> 01:13:55.080]  because people might think it's racist and that just means a the the tribal
[01:13:55.080 --> 01:13:59.800]  groups of scots that then the cook let's clan use that term just shows how dumb
[01:13:59.800 --> 01:14:04.760]  people are like words scare them like the word homosexual if you use it you
[01:14:04.760 --> 01:14:09.200]  get arrested in England I'm not joking BBC reporters have been arrested look it
[01:14:09.200 --> 01:14:16.760]  up Robin Page my point here is that they want you only to identify with racial
[01:14:16.760 --> 01:14:20.840]  issues and that type of discrimination or religious so they can play us off and
[01:14:20.840 --> 01:14:27.240]  invite us while the real discrimination is economic Goldman Sachs JP Morgan
[01:14:27.240 --> 01:14:38.840]  Google Apple General Electric pays zero tax in most cases Google brought some of
[01:14:38.840 --> 01:14:43.400]  the money back in the US it was like what 3% last year folks the average
[01:14:43.400 --> 01:14:46.480]  business isn't even allowed to take those loopholes you'll be arrested the
[01:14:46.480 --> 01:14:56.760]  average business pays 40% federal tax pays all the corporate tax I had my
[01:14:56.760 --> 01:15:03.320]  other lawyers and accountants look at it I'm paying of any so-called money we
[01:15:03.320 --> 01:15:08.040]  keep which why I decided just not every keep any I'll just totally just throw
[01:15:08.040 --> 01:15:12.400]  everything at the New World Order just I want to defeat him anyways that the way
[01:15:12.400 --> 01:15:17.280]  they've got it all actually worried out now I pay over 70% taxes one way or
[01:15:17.280 --> 01:15:22.840]  another look at France some people pay 100% now people won't believe it type in
[01:15:22.840 --> 01:15:30.080]  France now pays 100% it's a NBC news 100% 100 but then the socialists that came
[01:15:30.080 --> 01:15:34.080]  out are all exempt and have Swiss bank accounts it's a mafia they're like why
[01:15:34.080 --> 01:15:38.480]  would they take a hundred because well I mean the what's a gangster that robs
[01:15:38.480 --> 01:15:41.200]  your house gonna take they'll take everything if they can get it in their
[01:15:41.200 --> 01:15:48.360]  van how much you gonna take I'll take everything take everything including
[01:15:48.360 --> 01:15:55.160]  your life boom and why do you do that because they like to kill people well
[01:15:55.160 --> 01:15:59.160]  the smarter gangsters run the government and they sit back folks yeah
[01:15:59.160 --> 01:16:04.760]  there is French tax sores over 100% that's Forbes I guess NBC said to a
[01:16:04.760 --> 01:16:09.480]  hundred I guess it's over a hundred sorry it's worse than I said I mean you
[01:16:09.480 --> 01:16:14.040]  say something like a hundred percent tax and it doesn't sound real it was 80 by
[01:16:14.040 --> 01:16:18.480]  the way before the socialists got in the conservatives only 180% tax and then
[01:16:18.480 --> 01:16:22.400]  everybody works for the government or select corporations that are exempt so
[01:16:22.400 --> 01:16:26.280]  that's real discrimination by the way of an article here I'm gonna get this I
[01:16:26.280 --> 01:16:29.960]  said I go to your calls I'm gonna get this right to the nose 60 plus percent
[01:16:29.960 --> 01:16:35.360]  of abortions in Florida are blacks and Hispanics and it's the same similar
[01:16:35.360 --> 01:16:38.840]  numbers I have the numbers on Texas today whatever reason it the stuff got
[01:16:38.840 --> 01:16:42.200]  stuck in my stack I'm glad the guys printed it you're not gonna have black
[01:16:42.200 --> 01:16:46.480]  folks waving skittles around about 52% of their people never never seeing
[01:16:46.480 --> 01:16:52.920]  outside their mother's womb I've actually before had groups of racist blacks
[01:16:52.920 --> 01:16:56.920]  around me when I'm doing a report one time in East Austin actually most of
[01:16:56.920 --> 01:16:59.520]  folks were actually less but a few guys were saying oh look it's Alex and it's
[01:16:59.520 --> 01:17:06.920]  cracker cracker ass was the term and I was like what about abortion and they're
[01:17:06.920 --> 01:17:10.120]  just laughing going oh you know your racist you know your racist blue-eyed
[01:17:10.120 --> 01:17:14.600]  devil I was like okay so you get and and then they're like well there are too
[01:17:14.600 --> 01:17:20.120]  many people I need to get mine and that's that was the quote to me and it's
[01:17:20.120 --> 01:17:24.840]  just like so the establishes like yeah go ahead just kill everybody see they
[01:17:24.840 --> 01:17:28.120]  don't care but the but it's the same white people black people whatever
[01:17:28.120 --> 01:17:32.920]  everybody's being dumbed down everybody's being just turned into these
[01:17:32.920 --> 01:17:38.520]  crazy people that like are in competition with each other but then won't
[01:17:38.520 --> 01:17:45.160]  stand up together against tyranny which is a smart thing to do that's a quote
[01:17:45.160 --> 01:17:51.920]  of what I was told another time tell you how long ago this was I was at a
[01:17:51.920 --> 01:17:54.880]  McDonald's meeting some people I was actually eating McDonald's it's like
[01:17:54.880 --> 01:17:58.680]  12 years ago down on the drag off Guadeloupe Street at that McDonald's
[01:17:58.680 --> 01:18:05.360]  I'm outside waiting for a reporter it was a reporter to come meet me the Daily
[01:18:05.360 --> 01:18:10.360]  Texan in fact I think actually they just got there and the and the and the and
[01:18:10.360 --> 01:18:15.960]  the Daily Texan was a girl was there see that's right I talk about a story and
[01:18:15.960 --> 01:18:20.800]  then it all starts coming back and these two black guys walk by and they look
[01:18:20.800 --> 01:18:24.000]  you know intelligent and well-kept and everything which makes it even sadder
[01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:30.040]  that people of this you know so we see some clan guy going you're like oh
[01:18:30.040 --> 01:18:33.200]  that's just an idiot these guys look pretty smart and well dressed everything
[01:18:33.200 --> 01:18:37.600]  and they look her and they said uh-huh you blue-eyed devil we're gonna get you
[01:18:37.600 --> 01:18:42.680]  and I went excuse me I said I want everybody to have a future they're
[01:18:42.680 --> 01:18:46.560]  like yeah right racist so see now I've already gone off in the Trayvon Martin
[01:18:46.560 --> 01:18:50.040]  thing I'm gonna take a bunch of calls then I'll get into this news and all the
[01:18:50.040 --> 01:18:54.880]  rest of it it's just sick I want those guys to have a future and have freedom
[01:18:54.880 --> 01:18:58.880]  I don't want black people drinking sodium fluoride I don't want white people
[01:18:58.880 --> 01:19:03.480]  anybody else I look at children when I'm out of a restaurant I see little black
[01:19:03.480 --> 01:19:07.360]  kids or white kids or mixed kids or whatever kids and I think those are
[01:19:07.360 --> 01:19:11.560]  humans I want to have a future and when a little kid looks in my eyes who hasn't
[01:19:11.560 --> 01:19:14.680]  been taught tribalism and racism yet they're sweet little children with
[01:19:14.680 --> 01:19:18.880]  innocent souls and it hurts me because I want them to have freedom and I don't
[01:19:18.880 --> 01:19:21.960]  want them to be destroyed and I want to go over and tell their parents and I do
[01:19:21.960 --> 01:19:26.280]  it now to the point of my wife God bless her she goes do you ever stop I'll go
[01:19:26.280 --> 01:19:28.960]  over and say hi how yours how's your meal going they're like what are you the

[01:19:32.600 --> 01:19:37.000]  because you ought to read the insert usually people are thankful just for the
[01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:43.200]  human interaction I'm hurt by that not in a guilty white way being called a
[01:19:43.200 --> 01:19:49.480]  white devil blue-eyed devil but that I can see the whole programming the whole
[01:19:49.480 --> 01:19:54.480]  thing from start to finish where it's all going hey blacks everybody why don't
[01:19:54.480 --> 01:19:58.360]  you organize and stop the abortions you won't do that what about those little

[01:25:16.280 --> 01:25:21.080]  thanks for telling me about the Pepsi I've been angry ever since because I got
[01:25:21.080 --> 01:25:25.240]  cancer a couple years ago now it's in remission prostate cancer and I know
[01:25:25.240 --> 01:25:30.880]  everybody out there I you had an article by Paul Watson and nobody
[01:25:30.880 --> 01:25:35.400]  everybody's afraid to say yeah I don't even know how I got it nobody knows why
[01:25:35.400 --> 01:25:39.680]  we got this prostate cancer well that's because they are they are bum rushing us
[01:25:39.680 --> 01:25:43.880]  with hundreds of deadly chemicals actually it's thousands of that sounds
[01:25:43.880 --> 01:25:48.200]  like an exaggeration on average they put over 200 from the studies we've seen
[01:25:48.200 --> 01:25:52.520]  we've covered this is like newscast chemicals in the water toxic waste that
[01:25:52.520 --> 01:25:57.120]  have to pay to dump you pay calling it a medical additive forced medicating with
[01:25:57.120 --> 01:26:04.680]  the fluoride mercury lead arsenic barium the list goes on and on and yeah here
[01:26:04.680 --> 01:26:09.640]  it is ABC news group finds carcinogen in Pepsi products this was actually
[01:26:09.640 --> 01:26:13.160]  in natural news and stuff before it was there this wouldn't even be in the
[01:26:13.160 --> 01:26:16.680]  Associated Press and ABC news if alternative media didn't didn't see the
[01:26:16.680 --> 01:26:19.920]  reports from the groups and then force them to cover it see that's why they
[01:26:19.920 --> 01:26:25.840]  hate our guts is is we force this stuff out but continuing environmental group
[01:26:25.840 --> 01:26:30.520]  finds carcinogen in Pepsi and Pepsi says they might get it out next year maybe
[01:26:30.520 --> 01:26:37.720]  never I mean and and and what they found it was seven times deadly levels but I
[01:26:37.720 --> 01:26:42.480]  mean what's the big deal I mean you know nobody should discuss why cancer in
[01:26:42.480 --> 01:26:48.360]  children's up over 10,000% on average or why other adult cancers are up on
[01:26:48.360 --> 01:26:54.240]  average over 3,000% or why lung cancer it was up sevenfold in women ABC news I
[01:26:54.240 --> 01:26:58.480]  saw that like a decade ago that even though smoking went down lung cancer
[01:26:58.480 --> 01:27:01.960]  exploded in North American women but let's not discuss why everybody's dying
[01:27:01.960 --> 01:27:06.080]  come on man just don't you want to I mean sure the New World Order brags and
[01:27:06.080 --> 01:27:09.640]  books they're doing on purpose but they're killing you slowly and softly
[01:27:09.640 --> 01:27:12.720]  what's wrong with that and sucking all the money out of you in the medical
[01:27:12.720 --> 01:27:16.360]  system what's wrong with that all I can know it says thank you I got my
[01:27:16.360 --> 01:27:22.520]  PatriotSupply.com seeds cooking up growing away right in front of me well
[01:27:22.520 --> 01:27:26.080]  you're awesome listen let me ask you a question what type of cancer did you
[01:27:26.080 --> 01:27:33.240]  have prostate cancer and it's in remission they say you know $90,000
[01:27:33.240 --> 01:27:39.920]  it kicked me off the insurance plan and so prostate cancer they said you know
[01:27:39.920 --> 01:27:42.920]  yeah well more than this this chemical in the Pepsi that's linked to that as
[01:27:42.920 --> 01:27:49.760]  well as you mentioned it's the bisphenol A is a is a tumor grower and so if we
[01:27:49.760 --> 01:27:54.440]  wonder why we lead the world in breast cancer I mean by thousands of percentile
[01:27:54.440 --> 01:27:58.760]  folks that you look it up US leads the world in breast cancer and it's only
[01:27:58.760 --> 01:28:05.480]  increasing but they're saying half of American women by 2020 will have it or
[01:28:05.480 --> 01:28:10.000]  have had it and then it only goes up from there and they're saying 40% of
[01:28:10.000 --> 01:28:15.360]  Brits by 2020 will have some form of cancer I mean they're killing it so it'll
[01:28:15.360 --> 01:28:19.720]  be everybody's got it except all the elite they'll be behind robots and troops
[01:28:19.720 --> 01:28:27.200]  going I killed you I appreciate your call God bless you and again that's why
[01:28:27.200 --> 01:28:31.280]  I get so upset folks is it's just like I know this is all real I know it's their
[01:28:31.280 --> 01:28:34.840]  plan they've written books how they're doing it and I'm just I gotta drive
[01:28:34.840 --> 01:28:39.040]  home they're just 50 police cars and checkpoints and you know just cops
[01:28:39.040 --> 01:28:43.440]  everywhere and just bugging their eyes out at me because of course they work
[01:28:43.440 --> 01:28:46.880]  for a government that's murdering everybody and stealing organs and
[01:28:46.880 --> 01:28:51.960]  everything else and they're trying to get the cops to be even worse they're
[01:28:51.960 --> 01:28:55.400]  trying to make them be crazy thugs they're trying to get them to be out of
[01:28:55.400 --> 01:29:00.480]  control and they're having trouble but they're trying I mean look you ask how
[01:29:00.480 --> 01:29:03.800]  far though the tyrants will go as far as you let them Thomas Jefferson was
[01:29:03.800 --> 01:29:09.080]  asked what is the level that tyrants will grow towards and he said the exact
[01:29:09.080 --> 01:29:15.640]  level the public allows them to it's like asking if you jump in a big pit of
[01:29:15.640 --> 01:29:19.400]  starving piranhas with cuts all over you well how much will the piranhas eat
[01:29:19.400 --> 01:29:24.880]  they'll eat every scrap of meat off your bones they'll eat your joints you're
[01:29:24.880 --> 01:29:30.040]  like but the piranhas they're like but piranhas don't exist you know and it's like there's no
[01:29:30.040 --> 01:29:33.920]  new world order there's no corrupt bad groups they're not doing that they're not

[01:36:18.840 --> 01:36:23.440]  coke's got a lot of bad stuff in it as well notice Pepsi's mainly marketed to
[01:36:23.440 --> 01:36:28.440]  minorities and poor people and if you look at who heads up Pepsi it's top
[01:36:28.440 --> 01:36:33.760]  Bilderberg people this it's not a mistake they put fetal cells in the
[01:36:33.760 --> 01:36:37.880]  flavoring it's not a mistake it's got all these percentages it's not a

[01:38:13.640 --> 01:38:19.840]  calls Dave in Nevada you're on the radio go ahead thank you for taking my call
[01:38:19.840 --> 01:38:23.440]  Alex first-time caller long-time list you're great to speak with you I'd like
[01:38:23.440 --> 01:38:28.800]  a couple of points here please if I may I'd like to encourage everybody out
[01:38:28.800 --> 01:38:34.640]  start looking into some for emergency communications when it's all towers so
[01:38:34.640 --> 01:38:38.520]  different when the internet goes down we got to have a way to communicate you can
[01:38:38.520 --> 01:38:44.160]  get them on Amazon handhelds for under $40 next thing it's a real shame I had
[01:38:44.160 --> 01:38:49.440]  it a few the other day that it's a shame that your show is not translated into
[01:38:49.440 --> 01:38:54.880]  Spanish although I don't speak Spanish it would I think it'd be major if the
[01:38:54.880 --> 01:39:01.280]  Hispanic community could get your message I hear you look people are
[01:39:01.280 --> 01:39:06.800]  constantly asking us to do Spanish reports I need to be able to hire like
[01:39:06.800 --> 01:39:10.880]  three people to be able to do that even with a radio version or a TV version it
[01:39:10.880 --> 01:39:16.480]  is it is absolutely what's needed with 700 plus million people worldwide that
[01:39:16.480 --> 01:39:21.240]  Spanish is their primary language and because our main goal is not just
[01:39:21.240 --> 01:39:27.120]  making money our main goal is reaching people period you know that's why most
[01:39:27.120 --> 01:39:30.400]  radio shows have a target audience or they have a target group or a target
[01:39:30.400 --> 01:39:34.440]  country we're targeting the world and this is the real voice of liberty the real
[01:39:34.440 --> 01:39:38.560]  voice of America the real voice of the Republic in my view and that's what
[01:39:38.560 --> 01:39:44.920]  we're doing and that's why I pay to be on WWCR what is it to like eight hours a
[01:39:44.920 --> 01:39:50.040]  day hundred thousand watts worldwide even though it doesn't really bring the
[01:39:50.040 --> 01:39:56.040]  capital back into pay for itself I I pay to be on there because I get letters
[01:39:56.040 --> 01:40:04.920]  from African you know kids at a missionary school orphans and and and
[01:40:04.920 --> 01:40:10.440]  kids in China because English is the world language a lot of people don't
[01:40:10.440 --> 01:40:13.600]  speak it but if there's one language the most do it's it's English they
[01:40:13.600 --> 01:40:19.000]  estimate there's three billion people plus that have decent English four plus
[01:40:19.000 --> 01:40:24.000]  billion last numbers I saw that that have some you'll pigeon English so yes we
[01:40:24.000 --> 01:40:30.080]  need to reach those 700 to 800 million people that speak Spanish and also cover
[01:40:30.080 --> 01:40:33.280]  those type of issues it's just that I right now that's why they said like a
[01:40:33.280 --> 01:40:37.560]  four-minute plug I hardly ever even plug I am expending more money than I'm
[01:40:37.560 --> 01:40:40.880]  bringing in I'm spending backup capital that we had because I thought well we
[01:40:40.880 --> 01:40:43.640]  better have some backup capital around here you know in case something bad
[01:40:43.640 --> 01:40:45.800]  happens I'm just like you know what I'm not gonna wait for that to happen I'm
[01:40:45.800 --> 01:40:50.080]  going all out everything and so I hear you we need to do Spanish God bless you
[01:40:50.080 --> 01:40:53.800]  Dave I appreciate your call they use a ham radio with these cell phone calls
[01:40:53.800 --> 01:40:58.720]  to I can barely hear sometimes but I swear the phones are getting worse let's
[01:40:58.720 --> 01:41:05.480]  go to will in Texas you're on the air will hello Alex Jones hey buddy pleasure
[01:41:05.480 --> 01:41:09.160]  to speak to you man 13 year listener I'm calling today to share something with
[01:41:09.160 --> 01:41:13.640]  you and the listeners my partner and I just published an open source invention
[01:41:13.640 --> 01:41:19.000]  it's called robot gardener and it's an open source raised bed beyond organic
[01:41:19.000 --> 01:41:23.080]  garden that you can interface with over your phone or computer and even
[01:41:23.080 --> 01:41:28.440]  automate if you want and it's open source on robot gardener.com you can find
[01:41:28.440 --> 01:41:33.840]  it on Facebook Google plus Instructables build it yourself and have healthy food
[01:41:33.840 --> 01:41:39.080]  in your backyard conveniently and then a smartphone does it for you yes sir if
[01:41:39.080 --> 01:41:42.600]  you connect with a static IP you can do it over your smartphone but yeah we're
[01:41:42.600 --> 01:41:46.520]  we want people to be healthy and independent. It sends a robot out to do the
[01:41:46.520 --> 01:41:52.800]  gardening? It's actually a unit it's a garden unit and it has sensors and
[01:41:52.800 --> 01:41:56.600]  response mechanisms so we just call it robot garden. Sounds pretty interesting
[01:41:56.600 --> 01:42:00.200]  you know I personally on my shelf like to dig and plant the plants my shelf and
[01:42:00.200 --> 01:42:03.880]  that's kind of the fun but I guess is that for if you're out of town or
[01:42:03.880 --> 01:42:08.600]  something the robot does it exactly exactly right most people have these 21st
[01:42:08.600 --> 01:42:11.640]  century lifestyles and they're never home to take care of their garden so this
[01:42:11.640 --> 01:42:15.240]  way it doesn't die whenever you're on the other side of the world you can get on
[01:42:15.240 --> 01:42:18.000]  your device and interface with it and monitor it and everything. And then your
[01:42:18.000 --> 01:42:23.760]  smart meter it can interface with it and transfer all the data to the NSA?
[01:42:23.760 --> 01:42:27.340]  Well I mean we need to take responsibility for our technology in the
[01:42:27.340 --> 01:42:31.160]  future. Listen I'm all about taking over technology I agree with you the way to
[01:42:31.160 --> 01:42:36.280]  not you know you do this is not be involved in technology then the global
[01:42:36.280 --> 01:42:39.600]  is totally dominated. We need to be involved in technology but also involved
[01:42:39.600 --> 01:42:43.720]  in totally off-the-grid independent systems we should be multifaceted. I
[01:42:43.720 --> 01:42:47.280]  appreciate your call good to have you on board for 13 years I'll definitely check
[01:42:47.280 --> 01:42:53.920]  that out. I'm trying to think here about a point I was gonna make about the NSA. I
[01:42:53.920 --> 01:42:58.440]  was just thinking about how if you leak some of the private info of the giant
[01:42:58.440 --> 01:43:03.320]  sprawling government they call it espionage and terrorism and say Snowden
[01:43:03.320 --> 01:43:08.680]  should be executed. But when they spy on you illegally it's called keeping you
[01:43:08.680 --> 01:43:12.920]  safe. I mean it's just so asinine. It's the same thing as pulling up to a cop
[01:43:12.920 --> 01:43:17.960]  saying hi I'd like to search your vehicle. I mean I don't recommend you do
[01:43:17.960 --> 01:43:22.840]  that yourself you'll probably get taken to jail. How dare you but how about we're
[01:43:22.840 --> 01:43:26.880]  like how dare you want to search my car? No probable cause. See see how whacked
[01:43:26.880 --> 01:43:32.560]  it's all gotten? How upside down it's all gotten? Let's go to Christopher in
[01:43:32.560 --> 01:43:40.000]  Tennessee you're on the air. Hey how you doing? Good brother. That threw me off.
[01:43:40.000 --> 01:43:44.320]  Anyway I was calling I had a couple points I wanted to talk to you about
[01:43:44.320 --> 01:43:52.440]  today man main topic obviously is this old Zimmerman thing and I just it just it
[01:43:52.440 --> 01:43:56.560]  irks me to say you know that the powers that they are doing this they've
[01:43:56.560 --> 01:44:01.480]  always done this they've used this whole divide and conquer strategy to get us and
[01:44:01.480 --> 01:44:04.720]  I think that the reason they're making such a big deal out of it now and doing
[01:44:04.720 --> 01:44:08.200]  everything that they're doing and pushing it as hard as they are is because
[01:44:08.200 --> 01:44:13.240]  you know they know we're winning and so they've got to you know try to bring it
[01:44:13.240 --> 01:44:18.800]  to the people against each other even more so than they used to have to you
[01:44:18.800 --> 01:44:24.200]  know. No exactly and then the federal family will get involved in all our
[01:44:24.200 --> 01:44:28.400]  lives and militarize things to stop all the racial division and then and then
[01:44:28.400 --> 01:44:32.000]  everybody gets hyper racially aware and they're like oh you don't like socialism
[01:44:32.000 --> 01:44:35.960]  that's racist you don't have an abortion that's racist you won't do what we say
[01:44:35.960 --> 01:44:39.400]  that's right so it can just become a politically correct programming point
[01:44:39.400 --> 01:44:45.120]  when they're the ones literally throwing the gasoline on the fire and again
[01:44:45.120 --> 01:44:49.960]  Democratic Party ran the Klan ran the South and when they couldn't do that
[01:44:49.960 --> 01:44:54.040]  anymore and people totally turned against it they then became the race
[01:44:54.040 --> 01:44:58.760]  pimps of the so-called minorities that are really now the majority and that's
[01:44:58.760 --> 01:45:02.600]  why I saw articles like the celebration in the news you know of the liberals
[01:45:02.600 --> 01:45:08.160]  which are really just anti-human oh thank God less whites being born then
[01:45:08.160 --> 01:45:12.720]  are dying and I remember in all my college classes that's why I didn't keep
[01:45:12.720 --> 01:45:17.000]  going I went two years about to go to UT was at ACC for two years just finding
[01:45:17.000 --> 01:45:20.320]  out what I wanted to do while I worked a part-time job really I had two jobs I
[01:45:20.320 --> 01:45:26.040]  appreciate your call sir and every class it was always white people doing it I'd
[01:45:26.040 --> 01:45:30.000]  walk in and be anthropology class it'd be sociology you'd be archaeology you know
[01:45:30.000 --> 01:45:34.880]  101 and it would be white people are inherently bad thank God they'll all be
[01:45:34.880 --> 01:45:39.520]  bred with other people soon here is a picture of what they estimate by 2100
[01:45:39.520 --> 01:45:44.320]  what will look like a mixed person this is the way to go and it's like it was
[01:45:44.320 --> 01:45:47.560]  like anti-white I mean everybody knows that's going on and I'm sitting there
[01:45:47.560 --> 01:45:53.440]  and it's like next up guns are bad white men are bad all sex is rape and I'd
[01:45:53.440 --> 01:45:56.920]  go in an algebra class because I wasn't good at math that was my one problem so
[01:45:56.920 --> 01:45:59.600]  I was like taking high school stuff again my scores were so low I'm like I
[01:45:59.600 --> 01:46:05.040]  barely remember this in high school now I'm trying to figure this out again and
[01:46:05.040 --> 01:46:12.040]  it was like trigonometry too and I had a black instructor professor lady who'd
[01:46:12.040 --> 01:46:15.000]  actually gone to Africa and tried to help people and there wasn't any of that
[01:46:15.000 --> 01:46:18.240]  from her she was like it's so horrible you never see anything like it and she
[01:46:18.240 --> 01:46:22.600]  would actually talk about you know just the corruption of overall society but
[01:46:22.600 --> 01:46:28.920]  I mean every white professor I had you would go to or learn Texas history you'd
[01:46:28.920 --> 01:46:34.400]  go take you have to take that in Texas so I took it and it was just it was
[01:46:34.400 --> 01:46:38.600]  nothing but anti-American garbage I mean just totally so you'll be absolutely
[01:46:38.600 --> 01:46:43.440]  guilty and do what they say so they can then sell you on their agenda had nothing
[01:46:43.440 --> 01:46:48.200]  to do but boy you want to get thrown out of the class this has been in the news
[01:46:48.200 --> 01:46:53.720]  you go why do we abort most of the minorities and the lip licking will
[01:46:53.720 --> 01:46:59.320]  start because the real truth is the real clan is not you know in little trailer
[01:46:59.320 --> 01:47:01.800]  parks or nothing wrong with trailer parks you know what I mean with no teeth
[01:47:01.800 --> 01:47:07.680]  or whatever the real clan is posing as liberals and when you talk to a quote
[01:47:07.680 --> 01:47:12.040]  real liberal I don't care if they're black or white at the end of the day
[01:47:12.040 --> 01:47:16.600]  they'll say there are too many people there are too many of these unwanted
[01:47:16.600 --> 01:47:22.880]  kids and I've had black people to my face and including a guy we flew down
[01:47:22.880 --> 01:47:26.840]  here to be interviewed for a film and I don't even know what to do with it a
[01:47:26.840 --> 01:47:29.840]  couple years ago now we went out to dinner with him afterwards and he was
[01:47:29.840 --> 01:47:34.120]  just like no there are too many black people and I'm for abortion and and you
[01:47:34.120 --> 01:47:39.000]  know the state doesn't really have any and I'm just like whoa it's like this you
[01:47:39.000 --> 01:47:45.560]  find out that the real beyond racism the exterminism but hey Michael Jackson's
[01:47:45.560 --> 01:47:50.760]  out there telling black folks you know it is peak get your Pepsi and it's had
[01:47:50.760 --> 01:47:57.120]  the carcinogen in it the whole time and it's it's it's it's so insane it's so
[01:47:57.120 --> 01:48:03.720]  off the charts it's so over the top that that's why we may fail and fall is
[01:48:03.720 --> 01:48:07.800]  because just the average person has no idea how they're under attack and even
[01:48:07.800 --> 01:48:11.440]  if they did they have so low views of themselves I don't care who you are black
[01:48:11.440 --> 01:48:15.360]  white doesn't matter that they can't believe that they could fight it you
[01:48:15.360 --> 01:48:19.200]  fight it like professor Griff said he was at a hotel didn't know the food was
[01:48:19.200 --> 01:48:23.680]  organic they couldn't tell him here in Austin he just pushed the food back and
[01:48:23.680 --> 01:48:27.240]  said you know what I just won't eat and I've caught myself on the road or at
[01:48:27.240 --> 01:48:32.920]  restaurants just eating and giving my kids whatever and I mean my wife talked
[01:48:32.920 --> 01:48:36.320]  about this we said we're only going to certified organic restaurants now we're
[01:48:36.320 --> 01:48:40.560]  going to take our food with us when we go on the road and why wouldn't we I'm a
[01:48:40.560 --> 01:48:47.720]  bad person I know all this and I sit there and feed my kids GMO and not even
[01:48:47.720 --> 01:48:51.680]  a fast food place but a restaurant and then they act bad well of course they
[01:48:51.680 --> 01:48:59.200]  act bad the corn the wheat all of it has pesticide in it and what does pesticide
[01:48:59.200 --> 01:49:05.320]  do it acts as an infatamin generally I'm giving my kids poison that's why I
[01:49:05.320 --> 01:49:08.040]  don't want you calling and telling me how great I am folks because here's the
[01:49:08.040 --> 01:49:13.120]  deal I'm weak I know all this stuff and I can't implement one-tenth of what I
[01:49:13.120 --> 01:49:16.600]  know and I'm desperate and I'm frustrated and I'm like a mother you know
[01:49:16.600 --> 01:49:19.320]  these famous cases of mothers where they've picked up a whole car off their
[01:49:19.320 --> 01:49:22.480]  kid breaking world-wide lifting records and no one knows how they do it it's
[01:49:22.480 --> 01:49:26.240]  because we have governors in our minds that hold us back so we don't hurt
[01:49:26.240 --> 01:49:33.520]  ourselves but in an emergency the governor's gone and the mother may
[01:49:33.520 --> 01:49:37.080]  blow you know her hips and every vertebra in her back but she's gonna get
[01:49:37.080 --> 01:49:41.080]  that car off her child screaming for help that's when the mother turns on the
[01:49:41.080 --> 01:49:46.080]  real instinct or a father turns on the real instinct and we culturally have to
[01:49:46.080 --> 01:49:51.280]  turn on that type of instinct and just just tell ourselves the feeling is
[01:49:51.280 --> 01:49:56.000]  repenting and even if I don't believe in God we should be on our knees crying in
[01:49:56.000 --> 01:50:00.480]  the middle of the night over this I mean it's a fact the corn and stuff they
[01:50:00.480 --> 01:50:05.600]  feed us sterilizes and gives giant tumors to all the rats and rodents
[01:50:05.600 --> 01:50:09.560]  guinea pigs you I mean you can go look at the studies just type guinea pigs or
[01:50:09.560 --> 01:50:15.240]  rats and GMO I mean I mean they're killing us and I deserve to be punched
[01:50:15.240 --> 01:50:19.720]  in the face oh I don't like being punched in the face I'm not a I'm not
[01:50:19.720 --> 01:50:24.680]  into sadomasochism I don't like I'm saying at a gut level I need to be
[01:50:24.680 --> 01:50:30.680]  kicked in the butt to get moving I do not need to be thanked by people okay I
[01:50:30.680 --> 01:50:33.640]  mean that's how much trouble we're in here folks we got to get this car up
[01:50:33.640 --> 01:50:37.840]  off of our culture and that means we got to give it all and we got to charge
[01:50:37.840 --> 01:50:43.560]  through it and just yeah lift it up now or die trying and you got to hate the

[02:01:05.720 --> 02:01:09.960]  announcing the merger deal with the u.s. and the EU so that's that's how they do
[02:01:09.960 --> 02:01:13.920]  it they create mega regions then start merging those agreements but then break
[02:01:13.920 --> 02:01:19.440]  the subunits down where the original sub states have no rights so they break
[02:01:19.440 --> 02:01:24.920]  things up and then expand big global crime syndicate agreements above it

[02:02:28.120 --> 02:02:32.200]  it's it's I mean if you don't want to call it the devil you know what what
[02:02:32.200 --> 02:02:36.120]  David Ike talks about I mean it's something not of this world baby
[02:02:36.120 --> 02:02:41.240]  something that fell the fallen angel I mean it's bad
[02:02:41.240 --> 02:02:45.480]  the Zimmerman case here's my kind of theory I don't know you know it's
[02:02:45.480 --> 02:02:48.880]  popular not but for what I can tell it's going on with the media they keep
[02:02:48.880 --> 02:02:53.360]  wanting to make it the racial deal we all know that and everything so I kind of
[02:02:53.360 --> 02:02:58.360]  feel like he might be found not guilty because it seems like they won't the
[02:02:58.360 --> 02:03:02.000]  riots they won't there to be chaos and they want people to you know kind of
[02:03:02.000 --> 02:03:05.800]  get up and arms over it you know that minorities to get really angry well
[02:03:05.800 --> 02:03:08.840]  they're the majority now and that's why it's time to go back to the old clan
[02:03:08.840 --> 02:03:14.080]  days but now the Democrats are gonna have the the majority minority with
[02:03:14.080 --> 02:03:18.200]  openly calling their groups racial openly announcing whites are inherently
[02:03:18.200 --> 02:03:22.480]  evil I mean the Democratic Party's right back where it was in the 20s now
[02:03:22.480 --> 02:03:26.360]  great completely and again I'm not saying the Republicans are great either
[02:03:26.360 --> 02:03:30.320]  they're just offshore globalist frontman but the Democratic Party is the cutting
[02:03:30.320 --> 02:03:33.880]  edge of the New World Order you know when a samurai comes at you with a sword
[02:03:33.880 --> 02:03:36.600]  he's got the Democratic Party in his hand you know the New World Order's got
[02:03:36.600 --> 02:03:41.760]  them in their hand chopping everything up everybody just goes trendy trendy but
[02:03:41.760 --> 02:03:47.760]  but then at the top of it it's a bunch of organized crime anything else sir
[02:03:47.760 --> 02:03:51.960]  well do you think he'll be found guilty you're not guilty any thoughts on that I
[02:03:51.960 --> 02:03:55.720]  think that they know the jury because they're guaranteed spy on the jury the
[02:03:55.720 --> 02:03:59.520]  just departments and spies on everything they know this is going against them
[02:03:59.520 --> 02:04:03.120]  because injurious prudence and common sense you can say someone was probably
[02:04:03.120 --> 02:04:07.480]  stupid but he was being attacked and you can argue with self-defense it
[02:04:07.480 --> 02:04:10.960]  certainly not murder and so now she's saying well it can be involuntary man
[02:04:10.960 --> 02:04:15.120]  slaughter it can be manslaughter in fact I'm gonna recap that right before we go
[02:04:15.120 --> 02:04:17.880]  to our guests when we come back in a moment I still haven't gotten the meat
[02:04:17.880 --> 02:04:26.400]  of it today I promise to do that but he wasn't going to be convicted and so the
[02:04:26.400 --> 02:04:29.920]  just department with they admits involved in stirring everything up and
[02:04:29.920 --> 02:04:34.400]  running the protesters you know they started the snowball they know the
[02:04:34.400 --> 02:04:38.320]  jury's gonna have a quitting so now the judge is instructing him which they're
[02:04:38.320 --> 02:04:43.320]  not supposed to do really well it could be manslaughter and and he did that so
[02:04:43.320 --> 02:04:48.760]  convicting I expect the demon witch to probably do something like that and
[02:04:48.760 --> 02:04:52.360]  instruct them to convict her and everybody will say it's unprecedented
[02:04:52.360 --> 02:04:56.760]  but the media will hail it and Obama will say Trayvon looks like my son

[02:08:22.320 --> 02:08:33.800]  studios it's Alex Jones we saw a few decades ago back with the Rodney King
[02:08:33.800 --> 02:08:39.440]  verdict racial attacks on whites and Asians by predominantly black and
[02:08:39.440 --> 02:08:44.720]  Hispanic gangs in South Central LA hundreds of buildings burned down
[02:08:44.720 --> 02:08:51.120]  firefighters shot and killed and the police department disgustingly stood
[02:08:51.120 --> 02:08:59.200]  down because well they didn't want to be called racist and I'm not saying the
[02:08:59.200 --> 02:09:04.760]  LAPD is in its own weird gang in many cases and bad as well but one wrong
[02:09:04.760 --> 02:09:12.400]  the Rodney King rest in peace does not make it right to pull over a white
[02:09:12.400 --> 02:09:16.080]  truck driver and beat his whole head in until he couldn't even be recognized
[02:09:16.080 --> 02:09:21.120]  Reginald Jenny and I see racially motivated crimes in the back of the paper
[02:09:21.120 --> 02:09:25.920]  all the time and the media actually works to keep that hidden because it
[02:09:25.920 --> 02:09:29.320]  doesn't fit into the paradigm that everybody can do bad things and
[02:09:29.320 --> 02:09:35.880]  everybody can be racist why is it called reverse racism when I see cases of
[02:09:35.880 --> 02:09:41.080]  especially in LA where restaurants that are you know a hundred percent Hispanics
[02:09:41.080 --> 02:09:45.200]  cooking and doing everything will not let other people work there but there's
[02:09:45.200 --> 02:09:48.920]  been a lot of discrimination and it's been found to be going on but the EOC
[02:09:48.920 --> 02:09:56.320]  won't do anything because see that's not part of the political correct paradigm
[02:09:56.320 --> 02:10:01.720]  and this is nothing but numbers politics ladies and gentlemen that's all that's
[02:10:01.720 --> 02:10:06.200]  going on here by cold-blooded globalist and so the police boy I got some
[02:10:06.200 --> 02:10:09.000]  problems with the Florida police there's some of the worst out there on average
[02:10:09.000 --> 02:10:12.720]  from the numbers I've seen but some of them are good as well so they had a good
[02:10:12.720 --> 02:10:16.320]  police chief in this case he said look we have all these witnesses he might not
[02:10:16.320 --> 02:10:20.120]  should follow him with a gun but he jumped on top of him beat him up and we
[02:10:20.120 --> 02:10:23.280]  wouldn't have been you know and arrested him and indicted him but we were ordered
[02:10:23.280 --> 02:10:27.440]  to that's in the news today you got the judge knowing they can't get the big
[02:10:27.440 --> 02:10:33.080]  conviction for murder so now they want the manslaughter and and unprecedented
[02:10:33.080 --> 02:10:38.000]  telling him what to do versus his lawyers I mean this is unprecedented and
[02:10:38.000 --> 02:10:42.720]  she has prejudiced the case and it should be a mistrial but I don't have
[02:10:42.720 --> 02:10:47.480]  some skin in the game like it's you know a football team or basketball team that
[02:10:47.480 --> 02:10:51.200]  it's the heat versus the Spurs and you know I'm rooting for the Spurs and so
[02:10:51.200 --> 02:11:00.520]  and and the pro Trayvon group is a you know the heat or something I just at
[02:11:00.520 --> 02:11:03.080]  first was like well Zimmerman probably did something pretty stupid I wouldn't
[02:11:03.080 --> 02:11:06.000]  done that but looks like from the witnesses that you know Trayvon did
[02:11:06.000 --> 02:11:09.520]  jump on top of him and start beating him up and what do you expect when you do
[02:11:09.520 --> 02:11:13.080]  that and beat somebody's head in the ground that's that's that's a lethal
[02:11:13.080 --> 02:11:17.240]  assault that's aggravated assault give a right to shoot somebody and then we
[02:11:17.240 --> 02:11:21.480]  learn about the Justice Department oh I'm glad this is back in the news today
[02:11:21.480 --> 02:11:26.280]  because I saw this last year and it got I saw it on Drudge and the Justice
[02:11:26.280 --> 02:11:29.400]  Department admitted it it was a couple news articles but never got any
[02:11:29.400 --> 02:11:32.360]  attention and now we're learning the Justice Department's been involved the
[02:11:32.360 --> 02:11:38.640]  whole time trying to get big demonstrations going to politicize a
[02:11:38.640 --> 02:11:42.680]  racial divide and Obama saying it looks like my son and all this it is
[02:11:42.680 --> 02:11:48.080]  unbelievable so Time Magazine comes out says nothing about the thousands of
[02:11:48.080 --> 02:11:53.000]  tweets a day saying burn kill kill whites blah blah blah if Zimmerman isn't
[02:11:53.000 --> 02:11:58.640]  found guilty they come out and just say the police are racist here's the
[02:11:58.640 --> 02:12:06.240]  article Time Magazine cops preparing for pro Trayvon riots is racist and then
[02:12:06.240 --> 02:12:09.680]  they in the Time Magazine article that Paul links to I read it this morning I
[02:12:09.680 --> 02:12:14.520]  couldn't believe how disingenuous this is they never talk about the tweets or
[02:12:14.520 --> 02:12:18.360]  the groups organizing or that stores got looted and robbed Walgreens and others
[02:12:18.360 --> 02:12:21.960]  and there were racial attacks all over Florida by groups of blacks against
[02:12:21.960 --> 02:12:25.480]  whites predominantly you know like we're gonna get you know back at somebody
[02:12:25.480 --> 02:12:28.520]  like when the white guys dragged the poor black guy to death because they've
[02:12:28.520 --> 02:12:33.400]  been in gang fights together in prison a few years later a group of blacks drug
[02:12:33.400 --> 02:12:37.840]  a white guy to death on the same road like to you know even things up see
[02:12:37.840 --> 02:12:43.400]  that's gang psychology but it's like oh well people are upset maybe a whitey
[02:12:43.400 --> 02:12:47.400]  needs to get their head beat in I'm just sick of it and it's meant to make me
[02:12:47.400 --> 02:12:52.360]  racist but quietly so and only be in my area and and and then be balkanized and
[02:12:52.360 --> 02:12:57.520]  the government then plays its race card stuff and then referees I want to
[02:12:57.520 --> 02:13:01.480]  expose how socialists and Marxists have done this all over the world they'll
[02:13:01.480 --> 02:13:04.800]  use somebody from northern Czechoslovakia against southern Czechoslovakia
[02:13:04.800 --> 02:13:08.200]  and use old feuds to divide there they'll have one African group that's
[02:13:08.200 --> 02:13:12.280]  animus kill the Christians or vice versa they use any divisions they can
[02:13:12.280 --> 02:13:16.360]  we're gonna go to our guests I just wanted to hit this news Time Magazine
[02:13:16.360 --> 02:13:24.520]  cops preparing for pro Trayvon riots is racist and the police have come out
[02:13:24.520 --> 02:13:30.800]  they've put out PSAs saying you know hey you know raise your voice you know not
[02:13:30.800 --> 02:13:36.280]  your fist blah blah blah and they're being called racist because again it
[02:13:36.280 --> 02:13:39.320]  doesn't fit into the paradigm of what the Justice Department wants to do to have
[02:13:39.320 --> 02:13:43.520]  some nice race riots in this country if they can to divert off of all the
[02:13:43.520 --> 02:13:46.640]  scandals and the corruption to get us divided with each other here's another
[02:13:46.640 --> 02:13:51.960]  one police fear flash mob violence of Zimmerman acquitted jury can consider
[02:13:51.960 --> 02:13:56.840]  manslaughter charges in Zimmerman trial says the judge unprecedented witnesses
[02:13:56.840 --> 02:14:02.920]  to Zimmerman's tussle says he saw punches being thrown Zimmerman opts out
[02:14:02.920 --> 02:14:11.880]  to testify as his defense team rest the case and again another witness another
[02:14:11.880 --> 02:14:16.120]  neighbor that Trayvon Martin was straddling on top of him just like he
[02:14:16.120 --> 02:14:21.560]  said beating his head in the ground throwing punches and if somebody can't
[02:14:21.560 --> 02:14:26.840]  open a can of you know what you got to have a gun
[02:14:27.040 --> 02:14:33.080]  you know it doesn't look like Zimmerman knows how to go berserk plus if somebody
[02:14:33.080 --> 02:14:36.560]  came in my home and was coming to assault me I'm gonna use a gun even though
[02:14:36.560 --> 02:14:39.640]  I might be able to be you know beat him I'm gonna be an old man though I don't
[02:14:39.640 --> 02:14:42.800]  want to do that I'm just gonna shoot you but I wouldn't follow somebody again I
[02:14:42.800 --> 02:14:47.440]  wouldn't follow somebody even if I saw I'm knocking a window out if it wasn't
[02:14:47.440 --> 02:14:50.440]  up in my yard and at my house I wouldn't shoot him because I don't want to deal
[02:14:50.440 --> 02:14:55.560]  with the problems and I don't want to deal with my bullet missing and hitting
[02:14:55.560 --> 02:15:00.040]  somebody across the street but you come into my house you are deader than a
[02:15:00.040 --> 02:15:07.360]  doornail so that's all going on and then meanwhile you'll never hear the
[02:15:07.360 --> 02:15:11.000]  Justice Department talk about this when they're pushing racial division 63% of
[02:15:11.000 --> 02:15:15.280]  babies aborted in Texas are black and Hispanic annual total exceeds population
[02:15:15.280 --> 02:15:19.720]  of Galveston in Texas they kill the whole city of Galveston every year of
[02:15:19.720 --> 02:15:25.680]  quote minorities so that's what's going on ex-Sanford police chief Zimmerman
[02:15:25.680 --> 02:15:30.760]  probe taken away from us that they wanted the arrest in the local government
[02:15:30.760 --> 02:15:34.600]  taken away by the Justice Department through the state totally illegal
[02:15:34.600 --> 02:15:40.600]  Zimmerman must be acquitted Zimmerman must be let go or all justice is in
[02:15:40.600 --> 02:15:43.120]  danger and that's what they want to do they want to start like England
[02:15:43.120 --> 02:15:47.520]  arresting people that defend themselves that's what they want to do they do they
[02:15:47.520 --> 02:15:53.880]  that is their great crime is the individual defending themselves you can
[02:15:53.880 --> 02:15:57.880]  read our article breaking all that down judge in Zimmerman case pressured by
[02:15:57.880 --> 02:16:01.240]  Obama administration question mark bizarre outburst against Zimmerman
[02:16:01.240 --> 02:16:07.640]  suggests prejudice and not racial folks most prejudice is not racial you need
[02:16:07.640 --> 02:16:10.680]  to learn about that they only want you to think about that so you don't know
[02:16:10.680 --> 02:16:16.240]  about all the big stuff going on alright this is a really important subject I
[02:16:16.240 --> 02:16:19.920]  appreciate him coming on on short notice I saw this at new american.com we

[02:17:06.560 --> 02:17:09.240]  magazine was a little plug there we're going to break in a few minutes thanks
[02:17:09.240 --> 02:17:13.280]  for sitting there while I got to the Zimmerman trial news maybe I'll get
[02:17:13.280 --> 02:17:15.960]  your take on that towards the end of the hour and your study of how they use
[02:17:15.960 --> 02:17:20.200]  racial politics the Marxist do but before we go any further tell people
[02:17:20.200 --> 02:17:24.640]  about this latest bold move and why you're putting out the headline trans
[02:17:24.640 --> 02:17:30.440]  Atlantic danger William F. Jasper glad to do so Alex thanks for having me on and
[02:17:30.440 --> 02:17:36.560]  just as a coda to your remarks I was at the Los Angeles riots that you
[02:17:36.560 --> 02:17:41.640]  mentioned there I covered that I was in the streets there as all that mayhem was
[02:17:41.640 --> 02:17:49.280]  going on and offers 10 how racial politics plays out in the street and how
[02:17:49.280 --> 02:17:55.400]  lives are lost and billions of dollars and in people's homes and businesses
[02:17:55.400 --> 02:18:01.240]  destroyed and I certainly hope we do not see that but all of the same players
[02:18:01.240 --> 02:18:08.400]  and all of the same tactics are being used to turn the Zimmerman trial outcome
[02:18:08.400 --> 02:18:19.920]  into that kind of a terrible debacle and I I think that the the onus and
[02:18:19.920 --> 02:18:23.680]  condemnation really has to be laid on all of those people particularly in the
[02:18:23.680 --> 02:18:27.240]  media who are fanning this and those in the government particularly in the
[02:18:27.240 --> 02:18:32.840]  administration absolutely you have been inciting this I mean that's totally
[02:18:32.840 --> 02:18:38.840]  unconstitutional and immoral for the federal government to be sticking its
[02:18:38.840 --> 02:18:43.520]  nose into there and funding the protesters as the evidence shows
[02:18:43.520 --> 02:18:51.320]  organizing races ramps and the likes of Al Sharpton etc. we just recently done
[02:18:51.320 --> 02:18:59.360]  another in-depth hang on but back to your your main question most Americans
[02:18:59.360 --> 02:19:05.320]  are unaware that all of this week starting on Monday and through tomorrow
[02:19:05.320 --> 02:19:18.560]  the administration is holding the transatlantic partnership TTIP with the
[02:19:18.560 --> 02:19:24.240]  European Union it really is a it's being presented by President Obama in his
[02:19:24.240 --> 02:19:30.280]  State of the Union message said it was going to bring us boost American
[02:19:30.280 --> 02:19:35.040]  import support American jobs bring millions of good paying jobs to America
[02:19:35.040 --> 02:19:40.600]  it's supposed to be a trade pack which is going to accomplish all and just as
[02:19:40.600 --> 02:19:44.640]  they use trade to get the EU in by stealth and admit it same thing here

[02:24:22.520 --> 02:24:32.960]  all right folks you notice now you hear global government being openly
[02:24:32.960 --> 02:24:38.120]  announced run by private banks everything that William F. Jaspers talked
[02:24:38.120 --> 02:24:41.760]  about for I don't know three decades everything that old-timers at the John
[02:24:41.760 --> 02:24:45.720]  Burt society which I'm not even part of but who I know from history now we're
[02:24:45.720 --> 02:24:49.880]  proven absolutely correct is now just kind of pass a out in the open and
[02:24:49.880 --> 02:24:58.200]  there's almost no news coverage but what I saw Bush start in 90 in 2006-2007 and
[02:24:58.200 --> 02:25:03.760]  then now is being expanded that just like a steel deal a trade deal in 56 a
[02:25:03.760 --> 02:25:09.680]  treaty of Rome started the EU really rolling now they're doing this here and
[02:25:09.680 --> 02:25:16.160]  they're circumventing congressional powers just like NATO our military has
[02:25:16.160 --> 02:25:21.680]  been told is their new boss and Congress has been told as well and
[02:25:21.680 --> 02:25:25.160]  Congress has been bought off by these people in most respects so nothing's
[02:25:25.160 --> 02:25:28.640]  done so the editor of the new American magazine there's got an article out
[02:25:28.640 --> 02:25:34.080]  today transatlantic danger us e you merger talks underway in DC this needs
[02:25:34.080 --> 02:25:37.520]  to be discussed and blown wide open we've beaten so many of these other
[02:25:37.520 --> 02:25:43.040]  treaties and circumnavigations of our republic we're gonna beat this as well
[02:25:43.040 --> 02:25:48.600]  this is important I'm gonna tweet this article out in fact right now it is
[02:25:48.600 --> 02:25:53.120]  essential so mr. Jasper this is a short segment long segment coming up but get
[02:25:53.120 --> 02:25:57.120]  into the meat and potatoes of this for people a very important thing happened
[02:25:57.120 --> 02:26:01.040]  today in fact I was trying to get this article done before we did the show here
[02:26:01.040 --> 02:26:04.960]  but too many other things came up but a very important thing happened today
[02:26:04.960 --> 02:26:12.920]  today starting earlier in Europe but one of the top European EU bureaucrats
[02:26:12.920 --> 02:26:17.880]  Maros Sefkovic he's the commission vice president for in inter institutional
[02:26:17.880 --> 02:26:22.120]  affairs administration he gave a speech earlier today in Vilnius Lithuania
[02:26:22.120 --> 02:26:26.240]  Lithuania being one of the members of the EU and in there he made a very
[02:26:26.240 --> 02:26:31.640]  important statement in his speech his speech title was national parliaments in
[02:26:31.640 --> 02:26:37.160]  the future of economic and monetary union and it this article will be up here
[02:26:37.160 --> 02:26:41.920]  in the next hour or so on on the new American website but in there he makes
[02:26:41.920 --> 02:26:46.800]  an important statement to all these he's talking to legislators of Lithuania
[02:26:46.800 --> 02:26:52.960]  and he says he's talking about how under the new agreements that they have to
[02:26:52.960 --> 02:26:58.040]  because of the economic crisis the EU has to take over more and more authority
[02:26:58.040 --> 02:27:03.080]  and so he's saying this quote pooling sovereignty in this way would have been
[02:27:03.080 --> 02:27:08.760]  unthinkable a few years ago and yet now it is likely to be the model for the
[02:27:08.760 --> 02:27:15.880]  future very important he says pooling sovereignty in other words we no longer
[02:27:15.880 --> 02:27:20.120]  have national sovereignty anymore we have to pool sovereignty mean basically
[02:27:20.120 --> 02:27:24.760]  that's a euphemistic way of saying we're destroying sovereignty we the people at
[02:27:24.760 --> 02:27:28.260]  Brussels and the European Union and at the Commission and the Parliament we're
[02:27:28.260 --> 02:27:31.960]  taking over and we're calling this pooling sovereignty says that would have
[02:27:31.960 --> 02:27:36.680]  been unthinkable a few years ago but now it's the model and we need to be
[02:27:36.680 --> 02:27:40.760]  thinking of this we need to be thinking of this looking at this scrutinizing it
[02:27:40.760 --> 02:27:46.840]  really really hard because that is what is coming if the TTIP transatlantic
[02:27:46.840 --> 02:27:52.640]  trade and investment partnership succeed if President Obama he announced this
[02:27:52.640 --> 02:27:56.920]  they was putting this on the fast track back in his state of the Union address
[02:27:56.920 --> 02:28:03.040]  and he just got back from the G8 summit in Ireland where he reaffirmed this so
[02:28:03.040 --> 02:28:08.240]  now this week all week long is the first round of the TTIP talks until you have
[02:28:08.240 --> 02:28:16.000]  all these top European bureaucrats like mr. Miles here who just made this speech
[02:28:16.000 --> 02:28:22.240]  calling for their stating as fact that now the pooling of sovereignty is the
[02:28:22.240 --> 02:28:26.440]  model for the future there is no more national sorry we're taking over and
[02:28:26.440 --> 02:28:30.960]  really was they're not even merging Europe and North America as you know in
[02:28:30.960 --> 02:28:37.920]  their own admissions they're transferring the Republic a national-based country
[02:28:37.920 --> 02:28:44.640]  sovereignty into the supranational private corporate Bankster run system
[02:28:44.640 --> 02:28:47.840]  that's what's so amazing they're not just merging our countries into one big
[02:28:47.840 --> 02:28:54.000]  kumbaya which is bad enough this is global government foreign by central
[02:28:54.000 --> 02:29:00.000]  bankers well and that is very clear when you look at who is behind us and who
[02:29:00.000 --> 02:29:08.320]  are the quote-unquote stakeholders in the in this whole thing the big my next
[02:29:08.320 --> 02:29:16.160]  article that's coming out today I list the the groups that are the the main
[02:29:16.160 --> 02:29:23.960]  funders of the the whole process there's a think tank think network called the
[02:29:23.960 --> 02:29:31.920]  center for European the center for economic policy analysis and stay there
[02:29:31.920 --> 02:29:35.520]  let's go over it I'm gonna play a clip from my film that came out six and a half
[02:29:35.520 --> 02:29:39.440]  years ago in game when we come back as a few minutes long where I show them
[02:29:39.440 --> 02:29:43.560]  announcing this partnership and it got almost no attention and we'll find out
[02:29:43.560 --> 02:29:47.000]  where they are on this track how we shoot it down with the editor of the New

[02:34:53.680 --> 02:35:00.000]  the transatlantic danger US EU merger talks underway in DC and they admit
[02:35:00.000 --> 02:35:04.040]  their quote sharing sovereignty and the Russians will help advise on our mass
[02:35:04.040 --> 02:35:07.480]  events and all the foreign troops are having a big drill right now at
[02:35:07.480 --> 02:35:14.360]  Quantico and on and on and on and it is global government they announced on CNBC
[02:35:14.360 --> 02:35:19.640]  what's happening because the public's waking up to this and upset about it but
[02:35:19.640 --> 02:35:24.480]  the power structure is just going ahead with it so how do you see the state of
[02:35:24.480 --> 02:35:28.240]  the world right now and then let's get back into this and exactly what it does
[02:35:28.240 --> 02:35:34.760]  well they're particularly relevant to the TTIP and what we see happening with
[02:35:34.760 --> 02:35:39.640]  this attempted merger of the United States with the EU because that's what
[02:35:39.640 --> 02:35:45.840]  it is it's both economic and political merger convergence and I've quoted many
[02:35:45.840 --> 02:35:50.840]  of the top people in in Europe Barroso and I've done role play many of the
[02:35:50.840 --> 02:35:56.400]  other top people they've been saying this for years that they that unless we
[02:35:56.400 --> 02:36:03.280]  have an actual convergence and a redefining of sovereignty meaning
[02:36:03.280 --> 02:36:10.480]  defining it out of existence we will not be able to have world order and world
[02:36:10.480 --> 02:36:16.920]  order in their terms means that we have to have a central world government and
[02:36:16.920 --> 02:36:20.320]  that's really where this is headed and when you look at the negotiations today
[02:36:20.320 --> 02:36:27.160]  that are going on in Washington DC I've given a link to the US trade
[02:36:27.160 --> 02:36:32.320]  representative website it shows all of the areas that they are admitting to
[02:36:32.320 --> 02:36:36.240]  negotiating on it's a big long list I put them all in an article there on
[02:36:36.240 --> 02:36:40.720]  transatlantic danger agricultural market access competition cross-border services
[02:36:40.720 --> 02:36:46.480]  customers trade investment labor legal institution issues localization
[02:36:46.480 --> 02:36:51.160]  barriers textiles trade remedies it goes on and on dozens and dozens of areas all
[02:36:51.160 --> 02:36:57.800]  of these are being negotiated in secret by people who are supposed to be called
[02:36:57.800 --> 02:37:03.320]  stakeholders that's the official the US and EU officials that's how you get out
[02:37:03.320 --> 02:37:07.000]  of the people having any rights you have all these picked that's the UN model for
[02:37:07.000 --> 02:37:12.280]  those that don't know the the picked groups that you then say represent
[02:37:12.280 --> 02:37:16.920]  people and it's Goldman Sachs and BP and other Bilderberg funders you are a
[02:37:16.920 --> 02:37:23.760]  stakeholder right well Goldman Sachs JP Morgan Bank of England Bank of Israel
[02:37:23.760 --> 02:37:28.800]  Bank of Canada Bank for International Settlements the Federal Reserve the
[02:37:28.800 --> 02:37:35.640]  European Central Bank you see that all of these are listed as the top supporters
[02:37:35.640 --> 02:37:45.360]  the top funders the top promoters of the TTIP and they of course have pimped and
[02:37:45.360 --> 02:37:51.000]  gotten the US Chamber of Commerce the International Chamber of Commerce the
[02:37:51.000 --> 02:37:57.320]  National Manufacturers Association and most of the various industrial groups
[02:37:57.320 --> 02:38:01.880]  to sign on to this giving the appearance that this is really going to be in
[02:38:01.880 --> 02:38:06.240]  in favor of American business of course it will help many of the top
[02:38:06.240 --> 02:38:11.640]  corporations because as you if you read the European delegation to the United
[02:38:11.640 --> 02:38:19.040]  States website daily they show all of these public private partnerships where
[02:38:19.040 --> 02:38:25.280]  the EU government and privileged corporations are going into joint
[02:38:25.280 --> 02:38:29.000]  operations to get sure they're picking winners and losers businesses the
[02:38:29.000 --> 02:38:32.780]  independent businesses that really pay the taxes and that produced all the
[02:38:32.780 --> 02:38:37.200]  worthwhile jobs they're left on the cold they have to pay for that with their
[02:38:37.200 --> 02:38:41.240]  taxes no you're absolutely right and of course we got the BAMP Canada documents
[02:38:41.240 --> 02:38:46.120]  back in 2006 of the SPP in the first agenda a judicial watch got it anybody
[02:38:46.120 --> 02:38:51.760]  can look at this right they said we're going to integrate by stealth lie to
[02:38:51.760 --> 02:38:55.360]  your constituents and it was a corporate board there with the leaders of
[02:38:55.360 --> 02:39:01.960]  Canada and the US in Mexico literally taking their orders so here's my
[02:39:01.960 --> 02:39:07.160]  problem they're already merging the Canadian and US border patrol that was
[02:39:07.160 --> 02:39:11.040]  announced last week with joint patrols they're already sending US military to
[02:39:11.040 --> 02:39:14.160]  Canada during the Olympics their military down here Mexican military so
[02:39:14.160 --> 02:39:18.300]  they're doing the stealth integration I mean kind of like Obama had stealth
[02:39:18.300 --> 02:39:22.440]  amnesty and it's legalized the illegals anyways even though they can't pass the
[02:39:22.440 --> 02:39:29.200]  amnesty bill how do you fight this the the the just fiat implementation because
[02:39:29.200 --> 02:39:33.080]  from my research mr. Jasper they're already going ahead and just doing this
[02:39:33.080 --> 02:39:39.440]  well you're absolutely right they have been and again about the only time that
[02:39:39.440 --> 02:39:45.800]  we get any pushback on this is when there is enough heat enough fire applied to
[02:39:45.800 --> 02:39:49.520]  the feet of Congress that they start pushing back with the administration
[02:39:49.520 --> 02:39:55.160]  this as you know the Obama administration is trying to rule by
[02:39:55.160 --> 02:40:02.080]  executive order and they they have been issuing executive orders and there are
[02:40:02.080 --> 02:40:08.960]  many executive fiat that aren't even issued as executive orders in the
[02:40:08.960 --> 02:40:19.400]  in the actual federal register but we we still have a at least a bear outline of
[02:40:19.400 --> 02:40:25.680]  our Constitution left and we still are able to run programs like this and with
[02:40:25.680 --> 02:40:30.720]  the tools at hand we still are able to communicate with each other and with
[02:40:30.720 --> 02:40:35.000]  members of Congress and if we do not do it now while we while we still can I
[02:40:35.000 --> 02:40:41.960]  think that window is fast-closing and so it now is the time to put put aside
[02:40:41.960 --> 02:40:47.600]  the unessential things and really work to get Congress to take its take the
[02:40:47.600 --> 02:40:51.240]  right absolutely and that means state legislatures I mean this has been one
[02:40:51.240 --> 02:40:55.320]  of the big things I know your your program has been big on this to the
[02:40:55.320 --> 02:40:59.080]  at the county level the sheriff's and at the state level the state legislators
[02:40:59.080 --> 02:41:04.480]  and governors exercising their God-given rights is guaranteed under the
[02:41:04.480 --> 02:41:11.840]  Constitution to be the guardians of the people's liberty and to stand up for and
[02:41:11.840 --> 02:41:19.240]  to interdict those federal use of patience of power and so this is
[02:41:19.240 --> 02:41:24.720]  happening on a number of different levels this is what we see happening now in
[02:41:24.720 --> 02:41:30.080]  Europe unfortunately the people of Europe were duped for too long and so now
[02:41:30.080 --> 02:41:39.240]  you have it in the UK one of the few real serious pushbacks you kept coming
[02:41:39.240 --> 02:41:44.280]  largely from the UK IP the United Kingdom independent party independence
[02:41:44.280 --> 02:41:49.280]  party but they have got tomorrow tomorrow in England there the parliament is
[02:41:49.280 --> 02:41:53.680]  going to vote on whether they're going to have an in-out referendum whether
[02:41:53.680 --> 02:41:56.720]  they're going to stay in the EU or whether they're going to get out and the
[02:41:56.720 --> 02:42:02.640]  only reason they're having that vote tomorrow is because the UK IP and other
[02:42:02.640 --> 02:42:07.840]  independence minded people is that hey we're finished with this we've had it
[02:42:07.840 --> 02:42:14.000]  with this that the EU is hopelessly corrupt they are pushing for complete
[02:42:14.000 --> 02:42:18.920]  centralized control over all aspects of our lives and that has become very very
[02:42:18.920 --> 02:42:24.760]  apparent even before the speech that I just told you about today where they
[02:42:24.760 --> 02:42:32.000]  came out at this very inopportune time for the TTIP negotiations and and
[02:42:32.000 --> 02:42:38.720]  expose themselves that has basically doing away with sovereignty very
[02:42:38.720 --> 02:42:45.240]  interesting and it's such a historic time to be alive when I had a few years
[02:42:45.240 --> 02:42:50.640]  ago Nightline was here and it was the host of the Nightly News was was doing
[02:42:50.640 --> 02:42:58.120]  the Nightline piece it's the host of of ABC Nightly News folks and I can't
[02:42:58.120 --> 02:43:02.840]  remember his name what's his name the point is he was here we went out to
[02:43:02.840 --> 02:43:07.080]  dinner and stuff too he was hanging out with him like a whole day and he said
[02:43:07.080 --> 02:43:10.040]  there is no global government so I showed him Von Rompy saying it and
[02:43:10.040 --> 02:43:14.000]  Gordon Brown saying it and the head of the EU all this stuff and showed any
[02:43:14.000 --> 02:43:21.200]  use they're talking about a different world government than you are and it's
[02:43:21.200 --> 02:43:30.440]  like playing this little game exactly but I mean there's no apology that we
[02:43:30.440 --> 02:43:33.680]  were right about the NSA and we were right about globalists we were right
[02:43:33.680 --> 02:43:36.720]  about the big banks laundering drug money and running the drugs and we were
[02:43:36.720 --> 02:43:40.320]  right about all of it now it's kind of like okay you're right and we're just
[02:43:40.320 --> 02:43:46.240]  doing it no matter what I don't think people understand that that their
[02:43:46.240 --> 02:43:51.920]  public plan is to be tax exempt and we're not and shut everyone down as a
[02:43:51.920 --> 02:43:56.920]  political tool of austerity to make us so poor we have to go on the government
[02:43:56.920 --> 02:44:02.640]  dole as a giant collectivization reeducation the West is going through
[02:44:02.640 --> 02:44:09.600]  a high-tech version of the Cultural Revolution Great leap forward of Mao and
[02:44:09.600 --> 02:44:13.920]  that's why David Rockefeller in the New York Times you know praises Mao I mean
[02:44:13.920 --> 02:44:17.560]  and that's why our government helped put Mao in and that's why they continue to
[02:44:17.560 --> 02:44:23.720]  hobnop with all of the Communist power elite in Beijing as well as in Russia
[02:44:23.720 --> 02:44:30.600]  and elsewhere you know one of my mentors was he there to bury a who wrote the
[02:44:30.600 --> 02:44:35.680]  authoritative H2B reports out of Monte Carlo he was a contributing editor to
[02:44:35.680 --> 02:44:39.200]  the new American and to before that to American opinion review of the news
[02:44:39.200 --> 02:44:43.720]  and I went over and visited him a number of times over Monte Carlo he came over
[02:44:43.720 --> 02:44:50.520]  and stayed with me over here and he was one of the first ones to write about the
[02:44:50.520 --> 02:44:58.160]  EU as this was happening in the 60s 70s 80s and 90s and he was the one that first
[02:44:58.160 --> 02:45:02.480]  opened my eyes to this I could tell there was something not quite right about
[02:45:02.480 --> 02:45:11.160]  that whole European common market but he had done all of the homework and he was
[02:45:11.160 --> 02:45:16.760]  regularly in Brussels and started me going to Brussels to to the EU and NATO
[02:45:16.760 --> 02:45:23.800]  to get the documents on that and to meet some of the top people who had been in
[02:45:23.800 --> 02:45:30.720]  the EU and NATO and had seen what the corruption and the will to power were
[02:45:30.720 --> 02:45:37.440]  bringing about and so I like to give a credit to him he was a voice in the
[02:45:37.440 --> 02:45:44.080]  wilderness for many decades documenting what was going on there doing
[02:45:44.080 --> 02:45:50.800]  tremendous research on this and unfortunately not enough people listened
[02:45:50.800 --> 02:45:56.320]  to his warnings back then but he pointed out that not only what was
[02:45:56.320 --> 02:46:02.280]  happening but who is who is doing it and back in 1970s for instance he pointed
[02:46:02.280 --> 02:46:07.360]  out that it was primarily the council on foreign relations which in my article
[02:46:07.360 --> 02:46:11.400]  yesterday to point out at the end of the article it's primarily the council on
[02:46:11.400 --> 02:46:17.680]  foreign relations CFR which is the brain trust that is leading all of these
[02:46:17.680 --> 02:46:24.040]  other different think tanks and corporate organizations that are pushing
[02:46:24.040 --> 02:46:30.320]  this and it's very clear that their final objective is global governance
[02:46:30.320 --> 02:46:34.680]  world government to then carry out the orderly reduction of human population
[02:46:34.680 --> 02:46:38.560]  which is their real obsession and and in closing here I just want to say
[02:46:38.560 --> 02:46:45.760]  something if it wasn't for you how long have you been fighting going on 37
[02:46:45.760 --> 02:46:52.400]  years okay it wasn't for you and and the people that founded mr. Welsh and others
[02:46:52.400 --> 02:46:57.440]  before you back in the 50s and if it wasn't for the Liberty Movement and what
[02:46:57.440 --> 02:47:00.800]  we've done now for 18 years and all our listeners they would have already gotten
[02:47:00.800 --> 02:47:04.600]  all this through as it is the euros in trouble their whole programs in trouble
[02:47:04.600 --> 02:47:08.360]  that's why they're just barreling forward like a bulldozer but now they're
[02:47:08.360 --> 02:47:14.360]  uncloak some people understand something history is happening right now and our
[02:47:14.360 --> 02:47:18.680]  credibility's never been higher the enemy's never been more committed but
[02:47:18.680 --> 02:47:22.520]  we're never more committed than we are now and this is historic what's happening
[02:47:22.520 --> 02:47:26.320]  so I want you to know no one is going to sing our praises not that we need those
[02:47:26.320 --> 02:47:31.400]  for our ego but so people know you have power we have power the truth has power
[02:47:31.400 --> 02:47:36.840]  and what Jasper's done and the other people at the New American magazine and
[02:47:36.840 --> 02:47:41.000]  their supporters and what we've done I wouldn't be here probably if it wasn't
[02:47:41.000 --> 02:47:44.760]  for their research and their early seed of resistance and then think of all
[02:47:44.760 --> 02:47:47.600]  people that wouldn't be awake if it wasn't for what I've done it's the same
[02:47:47.600 --> 02:47:51.960]  thing we're in a family of liberty every race color creed religion for basic
[02:47:51.960 --> 02:47:58.400]  human dignity and the greatest evil this world has ever faced is this globalist
[02:47:58.400 --> 02:48:01.440]  scientific tyranny I want to play a clip from in-game when they first started
[02:48:01.440 --> 02:48:05.560]  setting up the merger of North America with the EU and Bush was pushing it
[02:48:05.560 --> 02:48:10.040]  again this is bipartisan tyranny here's that clip thank the Chancellor and
[02:48:10.040 --> 02:48:16.720]  Josie very much for the transatlantic economic integration plan and for that
[02:48:16.720 --> 02:48:20.720]  too we need to develop a common market common standards so this is indeed a
[02:48:20.720 --> 02:48:25.600]  very important agreement and the agreement that also brings with it a
[02:48:25.600 --> 02:48:31.560]  transatlantic economic council to be a permanent body with senior people on both
[02:48:31.560 --> 02:48:35.920]  sides if you look at all those issues in a concrete manner in which way to the
[02:48:35.920 --> 02:48:42.880]  EU at the time move forward the BBC reported that the US and EU had agreed
[02:48:42.880 --> 02:48:48.440]  on a single market by announcing a new economic community integration they
[02:48:48.440 --> 02:48:53.800]  were simply repeating what had been done in America and the EU on a larger scale
[02:48:53.800 --> 02:48:58.720]  the Accord states that the two blocks will aggressively push regulatory
[02:48:58.720 --> 02:49:05.040]  convergence in more than 35 areas from financial services intellectual property
[02:49:05.040 --> 02:49:10.720]  military education mergers and acquisitions they also agreed to jointly
[02:49:10.720 --> 02:49:15.880]  push a global carbon tax we recognize that we have a problem with greenhouse
[02:49:15.880 --> 02:49:20.240]  gases we agree there is a global threat it's a serious threat we agree there is
[02:49:20.240 --> 02:49:24.760]  the need to establish a limit to greenhouse gas that's good yeah we got
[02:49:24.760 --> 02:49:27.960]  about a minute left mr. Jasper editor at the New American magazine I just wanted
[02:49:27.960 --> 02:49:32.200]  to point out see they've never gotten Congress to sign off they're just going
[02:49:32.200 --> 02:49:37.160]  ahead with it and again it's they're doing it to shut down their competition
[02:49:37.160 --> 02:49:42.640]  and they brag they send the bureaucrats to harass real companies and they don't
[02:49:42.640 --> 02:49:45.040]  give government contracts to the small businesses even though it's the law
[02:49:45.040 --> 02:49:50.720]  they're supposed to this is a group of kleptocrats your closing comments well
[02:49:50.720 --> 02:49:59.480]  as we saw with the FTA free trade area the Americas and with the SPP they are
[02:49:59.480 --> 02:50:02.400]  going to try there there is a part of this that they try to that they're
[02:50:02.400 --> 02:50:05.520]  trying to push through right now with the negotiations they want to present it
[02:50:05.520 --> 02:50:09.240]  then as a feta complete as this wonderful magical thing that's going to give us
[02:50:09.240 --> 02:50:15.000]  jobs and prosperity and they're going to try to shout down all and ignore all
[02:50:15.000 --> 02:50:19.720]  opposing viewpoints they have that they have enough members of Congress both
[02:50:19.720 --> 02:50:24.960]  Republican and Democrat probably to push it through now they bribed enough of
[02:50:24.960 --> 02:50:31.840]  them with the with various bribes and and promises but that's what we were
[02:50:31.840 --> 02:50:37.720]  told with the FTA and the SPP that they couldn't be stopped when it enough
[02:50:37.720 --> 02:50:43.480]  people became aware of it absolutely what happened with NAFTA etc we were
[02:50:43.480 --> 02:50:47.080]  able to shout out William F. Jasper will follow this in the next few weeks with

[02:54:46.960 --> 02:54:52.640]  that doesn't mean that it didn't really happen to him though he was dressed up in
[02:54:52.640 --> 02:54:56.320]  gas mask and stuff which man scared the border patrol but something's going on
[02:54:56.320 --> 02:54:59.560]  here we're trying to investigate it tell us what you think about it because

[02:55:23.320 --> 02:55:27.480]  that Steve Watson's original article on it judge in Zimmermer case pressured by
[02:55:27.480 --> 02:55:34.280]  Obama administration is it races for cops prepare for pro-travon riots that's
[02:55:34.280 --> 02:55:39.760]  what time magazine says and why did the Obama administration organize and
[02:55:39.760 --> 02:55:45.760]  manage protest against George Zimmerman that's been forgotten but the American
[02:55:45.760 --> 02:55:51.320]  Dream has an article about it and where we're linked to it info wars calm there's
[02:55:51.320 --> 02:55:57.320]  another article in there by Paul Watson along with some video about shifting the
[02:55:57.320 --> 02:56:01.760]  public psyche and understanding what's going on you know I kind of had a little
[02:56:01.760 --> 02:56:09.000]  light bulb go off in my head right at the end of that last segment when I was
[02:56:09.000 --> 02:56:16.160]  playing that video clip from in-game that a lot of people get overwhelmed by
[02:56:16.160 --> 02:56:21.840]  this and I can imagine that it scares some people and at a certain point you
[02:56:21.840 --> 02:56:24.400]  know people may think this is just overwhelming it's like everything's
[02:56:24.400 --> 02:56:28.200]  been proven to be accurate we've covered now but then people go okay well then
[02:56:28.200 --> 02:56:31.840]  we're just taken over by criminals what do we do you don't know the power you
[02:56:31.840 --> 02:56:36.480]  have I mean a ragtag group has been stalling this and it's probably 10-15
[02:56:36.480 --> 02:56:42.120]  years behind you know on its global takeover schedule because little old
[02:56:42.120 --> 02:56:45.760]  ladies called Congress and people went to town hall meetings and people are
[02:56:45.760 --> 02:56:49.440]  fighting smart growth everywhere which just gets rid of private property rights

[02:56:52.360 --> 02:56:58.040]  irradiate you and they admit that and smart communities only let certain
[02:56:58.040 --> 02:57:02.200]  people build and create huge taxes on everybody else and enslave everyone and
[02:57:02.200 --> 02:57:06.400]  it's just all criminality you hear the words smart it means criminal ripping you
[02:57:06.400 --> 02:57:12.880]  off everybody that gets the smart meters you why people are against the smart
[02:57:12.880 --> 02:57:15.240]  meters a lot of people don't care they're getting spied on or they're
[02:57:15.240 --> 02:57:19.000]  getting surveilled they don't like the fact that their power rates explode after

[03:01:59.400 --> 03:02:06.240]  it but we do need to we need to come up with more stuff like that and more
[03:02:06.240 --> 03:02:10.880]  activist pages and more flyer pages or for on any issue whatever it is people
[03:02:10.880 --> 03:02:14.640]  can print off a flyer on that issue I've told folks that we've actually had a
[03:02:14.640 --> 03:02:18.800]  bunch of those thousands of flyers I mean let me be conservative hundreds and
[03:02:18.800 --> 03:02:23.600]  hundreds of flyers per contest there's been a bunch of those and I've wanted
[03:02:23.600 --> 03:02:27.600]  to get them all in one spot on the site but you can type in info wars flyers
[03:02:27.600 --> 03:02:33.520]  and we've got them on the police state on the vaccines on waking up I mean so
[03:02:33.520 --> 03:02:36.640]  there's a lot of stuff out there people can make their own flyers the new
[03:02:36.640 --> 03:02:43.200]  magazine has 10 bumper stickers in it four big ones and six medium sized ones
[03:02:43.200 --> 03:02:48.000]  that say stuff like forbidden information info wars.com America has been
[03:02:48.000 --> 03:02:52.560]  occupied by globalist forces info wars.com this is the July issue it will
[03:02:52.560 --> 03:02:57.160]  sell out folks should get it buy it and bulk I mean I've I've tried to do what
[03:02:57.160 --> 03:03:02.920]  I can well I've got a great crew but when you get a larger crew it almost
[03:03:02.920 --> 03:03:07.240]  becomes more work because then it's like getting it all done the way you want it
[03:03:07.240 --> 03:03:14.760]  but I mean what should I put in the kit? One of the things I've noticed in in the
[03:03:14.760 --> 03:03:19.120]  process of waking up and wanting to wake other people up is that it is hard to
[03:03:19.120 --> 03:03:23.440]  know where to look to find all the things that you need to show people and so
[03:03:23.440 --> 03:03:26.160]  what I was thinking would be a collection of different articles you've
[03:03:26.160 --> 03:03:31.080]  come across in the years that would be the best one to show somebody if you're
[03:03:31.080 --> 03:03:35.440]  really trying to hit them hard and get them to wake up. Well I think a film like
[03:03:35.440 --> 03:03:40.840]  in-game or the Obama deception in a wide range if somebody will watch that most
[03:03:40.840 --> 03:03:43.720]  people aren't going to read a lot if they'll watch that they'll see the
[03:03:43.720 --> 03:03:50.400]  globalist in their own words saying it so I think that's probably probably the
[03:03:50.400 --> 03:03:55.760]  secret right there. Let's you go I really appreciate the work you do Alex. Thank
[03:03:55.760 --> 03:03:59.960]  you brother I appreciate you calling in. Brian in Kentucky I'll come back to you
[03:03:59.960 --> 03:04:03.200]  later after the guest is on but Adam Kokesh hurting the cause is what you want
[03:04:03.200 --> 03:04:09.040]  to say go ahead. Yeah Alex I was gonna say you know I really like your show and I
[03:04:09.040 --> 03:04:12.400]  appreciate what you do and you know I like to think I've been awake for a while
[03:04:12.400 --> 03:04:16.360]  but you've really helped me focus and you know concentrate on the important
[03:04:16.360 --> 03:04:19.680]  things and you're almost out of time though man I mean look I don't like
[03:04:19.680 --> 03:04:23.760]  some of the stuff Adam does overall but he he's taken action so it's hard to
[03:04:23.760 --> 03:04:27.800]  criticize somebody that has courage. Well I'm not I'm not trying to criticize I just
[03:04:27.800 --> 03:04:32.600]  think you know I know you gotta rest at the pro pot rally and then with the raid
[03:04:32.600 --> 03:04:35.520]  the other day they found drugs in his house whether they were planted or not
[03:04:35.520 --> 03:04:41.400]  and I just think you know as a leader of a certain part of the movement stuff you
[03:04:41.400 --> 03:04:46.200]  know it's all it's his responsibility to make sure he's squeaky clean it doesn't
[03:04:46.200 --> 03:04:51.760]  give you know the authority any. No I hear you but see he he's going at it
[03:04:51.760 --> 03:04:55.800]  from the other angle but he's gonna live however he wants how dare them be in
[03:04:55.800 --> 03:04:59.640]  his business and how dare them lock people up in cages over drugs they

[03:08:22.760 --> 03:08:30.440]  was what 2008 he first was embedded with a well-known war reporter certainly now
[03:08:30.440 --> 03:08:35.040]  and one of the editors over at Rolling Stone magazine who really brought down
[03:08:35.040 --> 03:08:41.200]  one of the top generals and of course that was McChrystal now a few weeks ago
[03:08:41.200 --> 03:08:45.400]  his car most of you know the story blew up while driving down the street and the
[03:08:45.400 --> 03:08:50.000]  engine shot down the road the other direction and I talked to a well-known
[03:08:50.000 --> 03:08:53.560]  a reporter Nomi Prince who lives nearby she went looked at she said the tree
[03:08:53.560 --> 03:08:56.880]  wasn't really damaged and it looked like from the photos it came up to rest
[03:08:56.880 --> 03:09:00.680]  against it then we learned he was getting death threats hours before he said
[03:09:00.680 --> 03:09:06.120]  I'm gonna go into hiding off the radar I've got my biggest story ever listen if
[03:09:06.120 --> 03:09:10.320]  I ever come on here and say I'm getting threats I'm going off the radar I'm
[03:09:10.320 --> 03:09:15.240]  about to break my biggest story ever and my car blows up man I want an
[03:09:15.240 --> 03:09:18.440]  investigation and I said on air a few weeks ago I said it's a very low
[03:09:18.440 --> 03:09:22.880]  probability that this wasn't some type of car bomb just from all the experts and
[03:09:22.880 --> 03:09:30.280]  military people I had on days after that looked at it then I said we need to go
[03:09:30.280 --> 03:09:33.440]  talk to the police and the fire department and if they're told not to
[03:09:33.440 --> 03:09:37.240]  talk to people I said this on air over and over again and if they try to
[03:09:37.240 --> 03:09:42.800]  suppress the police reports the first reports I said ladies and gentlemen it
[03:09:42.800 --> 03:09:49.000]  means national security pressure was put on him this is NDA type stuff and again
[03:09:49.000 --> 03:09:54.120]  ladies and gentlemen I happen to know for family connections and things that
[03:09:54.120 --> 03:09:58.240]  there have been federal hit teams in this country they don't even have to
[03:09:58.240 --> 03:10:02.320]  hire organized crime for a very long time I'm gonna leave it at that I got
[03:10:02.320 --> 03:10:07.720]  family that gets mad if I talk about it but I've told the story before and the
[03:10:07.720 --> 03:10:11.600]  whole issue here is the public is very naive now San Diego and other TV
[03:10:11.600 --> 03:10:16.640]  stations went and because they'd heard our show and others and said well the
[03:10:16.640 --> 03:10:20.240]  family said they wanted an investigation and his friends were questioning we just
[03:10:20.240 --> 03:10:24.720]  wanted to learn the details and they even had to apologize on one of the
[03:10:24.720 --> 03:10:28.320]  newscasts and say we don't want to be conspiracy theorist they'd be like
[03:10:28.320 --> 03:10:32.160]  Caesar stabbed a hundred times two thousand years ago and people say oh
[03:10:32.160 --> 03:10:35.880]  it's a conspiracy theory that he was murdered when you're to the point in
[03:10:35.880 --> 03:10:41.080]  this country where the media barely decides to do any of its job and has to
[03:10:41.080 --> 03:10:45.240]  apologize you're in trouble and the media is like it's so strange they usually
[03:10:45.240 --> 03:10:48.640]  give us their police reports they're acting very strange they've been told
[03:10:48.640 --> 03:10:53.520]  here's the key not to talk they're like by who they're like we're not gonna tell
[03:10:53.520 --> 03:10:58.280]  you but we're scared just like the family scared and Staff Sergeant Biggs
[03:10:58.280 --> 03:11:03.400]  who we're about to go to he said a few weeks ago when he went on Fox they
[03:11:03.400 --> 03:11:06.080]  tried to belittle him and you know say well we don't want to hear conspiracies
[03:11:06.080 --> 03:11:10.520]  when he said hey it looks strange to me should be investigated how evil it should
[03:11:10.520 --> 03:11:17.280]  be investigated he said look the family I've been to the funeral there you know
[03:11:17.280 --> 03:11:21.400]  they're scared but you know the wife is saying she wants to bring down whoever
[03:11:21.400 --> 03:11:26.000]  did this you think that'd be national news no news coverage of him saying that
[03:11:26.000 --> 03:11:31.720]  on this show two weeks later okay so understand ladies and gentlemen the
[03:11:31.720 --> 03:11:35.280]  widow saying she thinks there might be something going on and she wants to
[03:11:35.280 --> 03:11:39.800]  bring down whoever did this and you know she's gonna fight this somehow that
[03:11:39.800 --> 03:11:44.200]  would be national news the media normally in the old days just even 20 years
[03:11:44.200 --> 03:11:48.640]  ago 10 years ago if one of their people got killed everybody investigated it out
[03:11:48.640 --> 03:11:53.920]  of a sense of camaraderie basic common sense we better hang together or hang
[03:11:53.920 --> 03:12:01.960]  separate so I can tell you right now it's about 99% in my educated research
[03:12:01.960 --> 03:12:06.800]  view that he was murdered and I mean you added all together you'd be nuts to not
[03:12:06.800 --> 03:12:11.000]  think that's where this is going and Biggs said he said look I'm gonna go
[03:12:11.000 --> 03:12:15.480]  public because other people are scared and won't speak out I'm gonna do this he
[03:12:15.480 --> 03:12:21.640]  do this for me and I tell you it freaks me out that there are so many cowards in
[03:12:21.640 --> 03:12:25.720]  this country and that's something that was commonplace in the old days I've
[03:12:25.720 --> 03:12:29.160]  studied history is now so rare but we commend you Staff Sergeant Biggs for
[03:12:29.160 --> 03:12:33.120]  being a good friend a good American and an investigating and I think a lot of
[03:12:33.120 --> 03:12:36.720]  credence has been added to your questioning now what do you think of
[03:12:36.720 --> 03:12:40.920]  everything that's transpired since we talked a week and a half ago sir yeah
[03:12:40.920 --> 03:12:44.840]  there's a lot of crazy things been popping up I found out recently that the
[03:12:44.840 --> 03:12:50.600]  LAPD actually made a stop by Michael's house just a couple days prior and they
[03:12:50.600 --> 03:12:55.040]  were spotted there he was also spotted looking under his car a few days prior so
[03:12:55.040 --> 03:12:59.480]  that in itself is pretty pretty fishy along with the fact that I called the
[03:12:59.480 --> 03:13:03.840]  LAPD and they told me there's nothing they can do they they wouldn't tell me
[03:13:03.840 --> 03:13:07.320]  anything and it seemed as soon as I brought up Michael's name they all
[03:13:07.320 --> 03:13:15.160]  kind of just got hush hush and just acted a bit you know uneased well I'd say so
[03:13:15.160 --> 03:13:19.640]  by helping cover up they began to enter the galaxy of being accomplices wow
[03:13:19.640 --> 03:13:23.640]  did walk through this this is really newsworthy for everyone in the state of
[03:13:23.640 --> 03:13:27.680]  this country I talked to you via text a few days ago you said you were gonna be
[03:13:27.680 --> 03:13:31.080]  talking to the police and calling the fire department walk through who you
[03:13:31.080 --> 03:13:36.960]  called what happened what unfolded well I called and I called the corner to to
[03:13:36.960 --> 03:13:42.400]  ask about where the body was and they said that they had released it a while
[03:13:42.400 --> 03:13:48.560]  back but when I'd spoken to the family they hadn't received it yet so that was
[03:13:48.560 --> 03:13:53.840]  pretty odd and then when I called the LAPD and asked for a report I said what
[03:13:53.840 --> 03:13:57.760]  steps do I need to go through to file to get a copy of the police report on
[03:13:57.760 --> 03:14:01.080]  Michael Hastings death and then all of a sudden they're like well we need to
[03:14:01.080 --> 03:14:04.680]  transfer you and then someone told me well we can't help you with this and it
[03:14:04.680 --> 03:14:09.520]  just kind of got pushed around I went from one person's call to another and
[03:14:09.520 --> 03:14:14.280]  oh that's not newsworthy that the body's missing obviously they're gonna have to
[03:14:14.280 --> 03:14:17.840]  because you've you've been in combat you as you said you've been in an IED
[03:14:17.840 --> 03:14:22.520]  couldn't you test and pick up the residue of an explosive
[03:14:22.520 --> 03:14:28.480]  well what happened was is they ended up apparently cremating the body oh whoa
[03:14:28.480 --> 03:14:33.240]  you hadn't robbed them oh they decided to do that yeah I'm not sure I haven't
[03:14:33.240 --> 03:14:36.680]  heard back from his wife yet if that's what they wanted but I mean I'm pretty
[03:14:36.680 --> 03:14:39.680]  sure that's something that he wouldn't have wanted I'm pretty sure I mean
[03:14:39.680 --> 03:14:45.560]  anybody would want their family to have an actual funeral and you just are
[03:14:45.560 --> 03:14:49.920]  dropping bombshell after bombshell on me again you're your good friend you're
[03:14:49.920 --> 03:14:54.160]  the guy that released the email that he was being he was going into hiding and
[03:14:54.160 --> 03:14:58.240]  being you know the FBI was visiting people then they lied and said they
[03:14:58.240 --> 03:15:03.440]  weren't tell us who told you that the police went by his house and that and
[03:15:03.440 --> 03:15:10.000]  that he was seen looking under his car I got that from a news group out of LA
[03:15:10.000 --> 03:15:14.840]  wow man I tell you when was the last time you you physically talked to him I
[03:15:14.840 --> 03:15:22.640]  mean over the phone or in person rather than email Michael yes probably three
[03:15:22.640 --> 03:15:27.640]  months ago yeah I mean you knew him so well and he was embedded with you for a
[03:15:27.640 --> 03:15:32.280]  long time and he's one of the guys you know he sent this email to what do you
[03:15:32.280 --> 03:15:34.960]  think he would be saying now if this would have happened to another
[03:15:34.960 --> 03:15:41.080]  investigative journalist like himself um I'm sure you'd be on the media or in
[03:15:41.080 --> 03:15:44.800]  the in the news as much as possible trying to keep us in the light and not
[03:15:44.800 --> 03:15:50.040]  have it seems so swept away it seems like it you know that when I was on Fox
[03:15:50.040 --> 03:15:55.560]  with Megan I think that aired maybe one time and that was it I mean that was it
[03:15:55.560 --> 03:15:59.000]  if you didn't watch it at two o'clock in the afternoon who's watching the news
[03:15:59.000 --> 03:16:03.160]  then you know most of time everyone's listening to the radio so not many
[03:16:03.160 --> 03:16:06.840]  even people even got to see that it just seemed like everyone just kind of just
[03:16:06.840 --> 03:16:09.640]  wanted to hear about it and then they wanted to forget about this students
[03:16:09.640 --> 03:16:13.760]  possible and I know that's something he would keep from happening he keep running
[03:16:13.760 --> 03:16:18.000]  his mouth he'd keep digging in opening the wounds up and making people have to
[03:16:18.000 --> 03:16:22.640]  look and find out what's going on you know Obama signed the NDAA and he's
[03:16:22.640 --> 03:16:27.800]  openly said and so is big sis an Apollo Tano the head of Homeland Security that
[03:16:27.800 --> 03:16:31.840]  that the main threat is not al-qaeda now for Homeland Security that it is tea
[03:16:31.840 --> 03:16:35.760]  party yours libertarians conservatives but also anti-war people basically
[03:16:35.760 --> 03:16:40.000]  anybody with a social conscience and then it were the NDAA really says they
[03:16:40.000 --> 03:16:44.160]  can disappear whoever they want and that they'll target and kill any American they
[03:16:44.160 --> 03:16:50.400]  want and so I don't think they've ever had it on paper saying that and we're
[03:16:50.400 --> 03:16:55.240]  seeing a real uptick in mysterious deaths of whistleblowers and people I
[03:16:55.240 --> 03:17:02.160]  man I tell you you said your gut told you something was wrong early on now what
[03:17:02.160 --> 03:17:07.320]  does this whole picture tell you Staff Sergeant Biggs the government's doing
[03:17:07.320 --> 03:17:12.080]  some shady stuff I mean he was on to something and enough to where they want
[03:17:12.080 --> 03:17:16.980]  to quiet LA up you know what makes me think about like Pat Tillman he was
[03:17:16.980 --> 03:17:20.240]  gonna come back and blow the whistle and look what happened to him yeah it's
[03:17:20.240 --> 03:17:24.080]  ridiculous the same thing all over again what are guys in the military say
[03:17:24.080 --> 03:17:29.240]  about Pat Tillman because he I guess he was a ranger you're a ranger you're an
[03:17:29.240 --> 03:17:33.720]  airborne yeah 80-second airborne okay but but I mean what did the guys in the
[03:17:33.720 --> 03:17:41.400]  army say about Tillman most people tried not to talk about it because you don't
[03:17:41.400 --> 03:17:45.800]  even think about the fact that your own government's gonna kill you and cover it
[03:17:45.800 --> 03:17:49.600]  up and just amount to nothing you still try to hold on to some positive
[03:17:49.600 --> 03:17:52.760]  ounce of hope when you're in combat and think that you know everything's gonna
[03:17:52.760 --> 03:17:56.720]  be alright well what's gonna happen if a lot of people start dying like this I
[03:17:56.720 --> 03:18:00.920]  think there'll be some pushback so well I mean if my car blows up then I guess
[03:18:00.920 --> 03:18:06.560]  we all know they better start looking around well you know I'm buddy we need
[03:18:06.560 --> 03:18:10.760]  to actually think about that I think if we went out to Los Angeles maybe we
[03:18:10.760 --> 03:18:13.840]  should go out to Los Angeles together I'm not I don't think you're afraid I'm
[03:18:13.840 --> 03:18:18.240]  not afraid I'm actually afraid of giving into this fear and if the family
[03:18:18.240 --> 03:18:22.160]  invited me I will go and investigate well I'll jump in I'll jump in anyone's
[03:18:22.160 --> 03:18:26.400]  face I don't care I want to find out what's going on too I'll go to LA with
[03:18:26.400 --> 03:18:30.280]  you in a second well I think we I mean you're his friend so you've got some
[03:18:30.280 --> 03:18:36.200]  jurisdiction to do it I I I've got his wife's contact info or email and the
[03:18:36.200 --> 03:18:41.080]  Twitter I know you've got her number and stuff but I get people having kids this
[03:18:41.080 --> 03:18:44.560]  is getting scary wanting to give it some space you know she says she wants to
[03:18:44.560 --> 03:18:48.400]  bring down who did it but but I'm not expecting a woman to you know charge
[03:18:48.400 --> 03:18:53.560]  around but I've told she has a lot of courage by you and others I just I just
[03:18:53.560 --> 03:18:57.120]  feel like I'm gonna let myself down if we don't do something about this because
[03:18:57.120 --> 03:19:01.560]  you see everybody I mean there's a lot of people I've seen a big outcry lately a
[03:19:01.560 --> 03:19:06.000]  lot of emails from people saying that they you know that they themselves are
[03:19:06.000 --> 03:19:09.320]  investigative reporters journalists who had looked up to Michael and people from
[03:19:09.320 --> 03:19:14.520]  Dublin to China are all you know really wanting to know what's going on but it's
[03:19:14.520 --> 03:19:17.720]  the people right here that you know we need to get together and we need to do
[03:19:17.720 --> 03:19:21.080]  something well you know his wife is saying that she didn't know anything he
[03:19:21.080 --> 03:19:27.800]  was investigating but she knows it wasn't about one of the friends of the CIA
[03:19:27.800 --> 03:19:35.480]  director former general Petraeus she may know something that she doesn't think is
[03:19:35.480 --> 03:19:39.960]  important but they know and I I'm not trying to like threaten her with the
[03:19:39.960 --> 03:19:44.360]  truth into going public but if I was her I'd be running around screaming bloody
[03:19:44.360 --> 03:19:49.040]  murder because that is Jim Garrison said in the Kenny investigation that's the
[03:19:49.040 --> 03:19:53.000]  safest thing to do and he obviously knew that that's why he was going into
[03:19:53.000 --> 03:19:57.560]  hiding to get a new story out quickly do you have any ideas or is anybody at the
[03:19:57.560 --> 03:20:01.840]  funeral giving you ideas of what it was because for our own safety we need to get
[03:20:01.840 --> 03:20:06.400]  all this out now it's the CIA that's the exact words I was told like I said last
[03:20:06.400 --> 03:20:11.120]  time she Michael told her that she wasn't gonna tell he wasn't gonna tell her
[03:20:11.120 --> 03:20:18.640]  anything any further into that matter but he did tell a lawyer he did he told
[03:20:18.640 --> 03:20:22.520]  everything to a lawyer and it's not the wiki leaves a lawyer so I still don't
[03:20:22.520 --> 03:20:26.760]  know where that came from okay so she tells you that or somebody at the funeral
[03:20:26.760 --> 03:20:32.880]  she told me that boy that lawyer is I like to know who that lawyer is because
[03:20:32.880 --> 03:20:36.120]  that that well they've obviously got him surveilled but he knows how to do
[03:20:36.120 --> 03:20:39.960]  countermeasures that lawyer needs to be investigated I'm not saying the lawyers
[03:20:39.960 --> 03:20:43.960]  involved we don't know who they are yet but I'm telling you either that person
[03:20:43.960 --> 03:20:47.760]  would be telling it all or they're they're out of their mind I see I had the
[03:20:47.760 --> 03:20:51.960]  DC Matamon I've had a bunch of people on and they kill him like a month later I
[03:20:51.960 --> 03:20:55.840]  mean I've lived through this and I'm just probably the only way to get the
[03:20:55.840 --> 03:20:59.720]  information out of the police and things like that I mean the only way to get
[03:20:59.720 --> 03:21:03.080]  information anytime when you can't get something to sue somebody something
[03:21:03.080 --> 03:21:07.280]  from what I've been told the easiest way to get information is just start a law
[03:21:07.280 --> 03:21:10.320]  suit sue somebody and then the information has to be brought to light
[03:21:10.320 --> 03:21:14.440]  that's right but nowadays it's so corrupt they'll put out fake stuff but that
[03:21:14.440 --> 03:21:17.320]  happened with Oklahoma City bombing that's why we found out Southern Poverty
[03:21:17.320 --> 03:21:22.280]  Law Center was in the catbird seat there at the Elohim Center along with the
[03:21:22.280 --> 03:21:27.200]  deputy attorney general who's now the attorney general look they're just
[03:21:27.200 --> 03:21:31.560]  gangsters and I and I can't believe the LAPD is that corrupt and the fire
[03:21:31.560 --> 03:21:35.840]  department is that cowardly that they wouldn't be speaking out I mean it's
[03:21:35.840 --> 03:21:43.880]  this culture of fear that allows these bad guys to take over yeah everyone's
[03:21:43.880 --> 03:21:48.080]  scared people want to talk and no one wants to take that that step to actually
[03:21:48.080 --> 03:21:51.400]  make something happen most people just want to go through their lives and
[03:21:51.400 --> 03:21:55.200]  pretend like everything's fine and they don't really want to see open that
[03:21:55.200 --> 03:21:58.160]  curtain and see what's really going on back there but don't they get that that
[03:21:58.160 --> 03:22:02.400]  lets the evil take over when they have that attitude most people are just like
[03:22:02.400 --> 03:22:05.880]  you said before she pulls they don't care as long as they get their their pay
[03:22:05.880 --> 03:22:09.800]  check every other week and their AC's on and their cell phones work and they get
[03:22:09.800 --> 03:22:13.640]  to play the little video games are happy most people would rather live in the
[03:22:13.640 --> 03:22:17.840]  dark than see what's really out there yep and then whenever Tom people act like
[03:22:17.840 --> 03:22:21.360]  that you get a Nazi Germany or a Soviet towel deal because the criminals
[03:22:21.360 --> 03:22:24.680]  aren't gonna stop grabbing look I've been asking a lot of the questions here
[03:22:24.680 --> 03:22:28.720]  Staff Sergeant Joseph Biggs and one of his best military buddies from all those
[03:22:28.720 --> 03:22:32.320]  years of being embedded over there one of the only guy to release that he was
[03:22:32.320 --> 03:22:36.040]  we wouldn't know that he was going into hiding we wouldn't know they were death
[03:22:36.040 --> 03:22:38.880]  threatening and we wouldn't know about the email because everybody had the
[03:22:38.880 --> 03:22:42.600]  email but we're too afraid to release it in the five minutes we've got left here
[03:22:42.600 --> 03:22:46.240]  with you I want to give you the floor instead of me asking questions about
[03:22:46.240 --> 03:22:50.280]  other points you'd like to make or what you'd like to say to people out there a
[03:22:50.280 --> 03:22:54.440]  the cowards that are going along with this and be maybe those that were part
[03:22:54.440 --> 03:22:58.160]  of this because I don't know how they think they're gonna have a future in a
[03:22:58.160 --> 03:23:03.920]  country this corrupt well I know whoever did this you know you got me to look
[03:23:03.920 --> 03:23:06.880]  forward to seeing I'm gonna definitely find out what's going on because I'm
[03:23:06.880 --> 03:23:11.600]  gonna pull back those those band-aids I'm gonna dig into that scab and I'm gonna
[03:23:11.600 --> 03:23:15.960]  find out that dirt and I'm gonna come after them and bring that into the media
[03:23:15.960 --> 03:23:22.440]  as fast as I can whatever I can find out I will and people need to help out I
[03:23:22.440 --> 03:23:27.040]  mean I need to find a lawyer down in LA they can actually give me some legal
[03:23:27.040 --> 03:23:31.920]  advice on how we could take steps to get this information from the police and it
[03:23:31.920 --> 03:23:39.080]  needs to be done fast well the CIA has got ice darts that have cyanide in them
[03:23:39.080 --> 03:23:43.520]  that basically dissipates and almost impossible to find in toxicology they've
[03:23:43.520 --> 03:23:48.800]  got 101 ways on top of 101 to kill somebody nobody knows they blew that up
[03:23:48.800 --> 03:23:55.480]  as a message to everybody sorry go ahead keep going no you're good no it's
[03:23:55.480 --> 03:23:58.520]  just you I mean everything you say makes me think of other things other points
[03:23:58.520 --> 03:24:05.320]  you'd like to make other than that I just I just I'm getting scared the fact
[03:24:05.320 --> 03:24:09.760]  that people are just gonna forget about this we need to keep this like front
[03:24:09.760 --> 03:24:14.760]  page as much as possible people need to keep asking questions I mean not just
[03:24:14.760 --> 03:24:19.120]  me everyone should want to know what happened because it doesn't seem right
[03:24:19.120 --> 03:24:22.960]  everyone should have that that gut feeling in you that makes you a human
[03:24:22.960 --> 03:24:27.280]  being that wants to see the right thing done and to just ignore it and sweep it
[03:24:27.280 --> 03:24:32.520]  away just it makes me want to throw up that's exactly how I feel like it makes
[03:24:32.520 --> 03:24:36.360]  you feel nauseous and it's like being smothered and you're not even worried
[03:24:36.360 --> 03:24:39.800]  about getting killed or set up because all that matters is that we don't lay
[03:24:39.800 --> 03:24:44.040]  down because I'm telling you folks if they can kill top reporters investigative
[03:24:44.040 --> 03:24:48.040]  reporters worldwide this guy wasn't just one of the biggest in the US top three
[03:24:48.040 --> 03:24:51.720]  or four probably worldwide who they knew was real you know that that that speech
[03:24:51.720 --> 03:24:55.480]  I played about a week before he got killed he was on Young Turks where he
[03:24:55.480 --> 03:24:59.280]  said look they're coming out for the media this is authoritarianism we got a
[03:24:59.280 --> 03:25:02.840]  band together and they've declared war on us we got to declare war on them and
[03:25:02.840 --> 03:25:06.960]  just put all the national security stuff out the crimes they're committing these
[03:25:06.960 --> 03:25:10.280]  are he had found out how bad they really are he'd had that moment of
[03:25:10.280 --> 03:25:14.280]  conscience that he was gonna go all the way and they blow him up and and the
[03:25:14.280 --> 03:25:17.320]  issue is that if they kill you if they kill me it becomes more and more obvious
[03:25:17.320 --> 03:25:21.200]  this has happened a lot in history all that matters is they're gonna get taken
[03:25:21.200 --> 03:25:28.480]  down if we all cower then they're gonna win and start killing whoever they want
[03:25:28.480 --> 03:25:33.520]  yeah well I'm not gonna cower I'll tell you that I'll stand right in their face
[03:25:33.520 --> 03:25:37.320]  and tell them how it is well they're cowards they'll put another car bomb on
[03:25:37.320 --> 03:25:40.800]  you and they probably aren't gonna do that I mean he had something big for
[03:25:40.800 --> 03:25:44.120]  them to do that and it was a message to the media you know because the media is
[03:25:44.120 --> 03:25:46.880]  not stupid they know they killed him that's why Megan Kelly I can't even
[03:25:46.880 --> 03:25:50.080]  look at her now like laughing at you when you're on there like it's funny this
[03:25:50.080 --> 03:25:56.640]  isn't funny even if you were wrong your buddies dead yeah yeah I'm not too keen
[03:25:56.640 --> 03:26:02.040]  on her anymore either well look man I as soon as you're gone in three or four
[03:26:02.040 --> 03:26:06.040]  minutes I'll have 10 questions that come in my head I'm just flabbergasted at
[03:26:06.040 --> 03:26:12.120]  this point any other tidbits from the funeral anything else that the his
[03:26:12.120 --> 03:26:15.760]  widow said you know she said quote to you I'm gonna find them and bring them
[03:26:15.760 --> 03:26:21.240]  down was that the quote she pulled me aside she said you know she's like you
[03:26:21.240 --> 03:26:23.640]  know I'm gonna do everything I can to find these guys and you know find out
[03:26:23.640 --> 03:26:28.040]  what happened and I told her I would be there side-by-side to help her every
[03:26:28.040 --> 03:26:31.360]  step of the way and I she gave me her email and I emailed her back later on
[03:26:31.360 --> 03:26:35.800]  after I gave her some time and we've spoken on the phone and texted a few
[03:26:35.800 --> 03:26:42.280]  times and you know she's trying to get in and or I think she might have an
[03:26:42.280 --> 03:26:47.360]  investigator now to help her out and she's doing a lot I think she can my
[03:26:47.360 --> 03:26:52.560]  side is I want to keep this as public as possible the whole time so it's in the
[03:26:52.560 --> 03:26:56.880]  public eye and I want people to every time they turn on the friggin TV or
[03:26:56.880 --> 03:26:59.960]  listen the radio someone's talking about it so people are thinking about it
[03:26:59.960 --> 03:27:05.080]  because I'm just I can't sleep anymore I'd stop going to school for two weeks I
[03:27:05.080 --> 03:27:09.880]  mean I've just I can't it's completely listen get the rest you need and
[03:27:09.880 --> 03:27:13.600]  step and say clearly they'll say oh he committed suicide he was sad about his
[03:27:13.600 --> 03:27:17.840]  friend you're on record you're never gonna commit suicide oh god no me neither
[03:27:17.840 --> 03:27:22.160]  and again I don't drive a hundred miles an hour my car's not gonna blow up I do
[03:27:22.160 --> 03:27:26.480]  not want my body cremated I want a third party two different autopsies my
[03:27:26.480 --> 03:27:31.040]  family will pay for it what about you yeah I want people to see I'm not afraid
[03:27:31.040 --> 03:27:35.000]  no no I hear you but give people a living will let me tell you they'll
[03:27:35.000 --> 03:27:38.800]  blow you up or me up and then cremate us oh yeah I've already got one of those
[03:27:38.800 --> 03:27:43.960]  don't I did one of those a few years ago I'm sure you did but that's the great
[03:27:43.960 --> 03:27:46.680]  part though that's why they hate the veterans sure you've seen the Homeland
[03:27:46.680 --> 03:27:49.240]  Security documents where they say the veterans are the number one terror
[03:27:49.240 --> 03:27:54.080]  threat that's even the Washington Post it's because they know veterans aren't
[03:27:54.080 --> 03:27:58.720]  afraid and have faced death and they're afraid of men and women who are not
[03:27:58.720 --> 03:28:02.640]  cowards well that you just see all the shady stuff that goes on and you're
[03:28:02.640 --> 03:28:07.520]  just not willing to you know be quiet about it most people just hear about it
[03:28:07.520 --> 03:28:11.280]  but to actually see a lot of this stuff that's right so you're not naive you saw
[03:28:11.280 --> 03:28:15.520]  a lot of chicanery yeah I mean like I said before I've been I've been I've been
[03:28:15.520 --> 03:28:19.160]  in vehicles that are blowing up and you know throwing my vehicle 10 feet up in
[03:28:19.160 --> 03:28:24.600]  the air and completely demolished you know and I've got you know cut all over
[03:28:24.600 --> 03:28:30.440]  my body and my vehicle at no time was in engulfed in the flames that were
[03:28:30.440 --> 03:28:34.840]  engulfed in that Mercedes Benz which still just blows my mind and they just
[03:28:34.840 --> 03:28:41.440]  want to shake it off and say no foul play well I tell you I'm sure looking
[03:28:41.440 --> 03:28:45.320]  down from heaven that Michael appreciates you as a friend doing this and
[03:28:45.320 --> 03:28:49.600]  it's important for the real media to continue to cover this and it's important
[03:28:49.600 --> 03:28:53.240]  I mean at least we are getting some mainline TV stations to ask questions
[03:28:53.240 --> 03:28:56.400]  now so it's not just you or I saying we've called they won't give us the
[03:28:56.400 --> 03:29:02.360]  police report yeah that's good Dalia man how suspicious we've been told not to
[03:29:02.360 --> 03:29:06.560]  talk the bodies disappeared basically been cremated and we're not gonna give
[03:29:06.560 --> 03:29:12.000]  you a police report one thing after another but either way every dirty little
[03:29:12.000 --> 03:29:16.440]  lies that have come forth at some point we'll find out what's your gut tell you
[03:29:16.440 --> 03:29:21.120]  staff sergeant Joseph Biggs what he had on the CIA or just no idea who knows
[03:29:21.120 --> 03:29:26.280]  what it was I mean I don't know exactly what it could be I mean it's kind of
[03:29:26.280 --> 03:29:30.240]  funny all these things with Snowden that's happening who knows what he was
[03:29:30.240 --> 03:29:34.480]  going after but you know someone probably got there you know was a whistleblower
[03:29:34.480 --> 03:29:38.320]  came forth to him gave him some information and he probably followed one
[03:29:38.320 --> 03:29:41.440]  of those leads you know and it could have been like a CIA guy it could be
[03:29:41.440 --> 03:29:45.100]  anybody who knows somebody with some kind of power like that I salute your
[03:29:45.100 --> 03:29:48.680]  courage staff sergeant Biggs we'll talk again soon we'll we'll keep this story
