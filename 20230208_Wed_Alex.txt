[00:00.000 --> 00:29.980]  Why would anyone think that our corrupt
[00:29.980 --> 00:36.140]  government sees communist China as an enemy? They have been close partners for over 50 years.
[00:36.700 --> 00:42.780]  In 1971, after Mao Tse-tung spent years calling for the invasion of America,
[00:42.780 --> 00:49.340]  Henry Kissinger, acting as President Nixon's special representative, secretly traveled to Beijing
[00:49.340 --> 00:55.740]  to open business relations with the CCP. George H.W. Bush then went to China as the
[00:55.740 --> 01:02.460]  director of the U.S. Liaison Office and paved the way for multinational outsourcing of America's
[01:02.460 --> 01:09.420]  labor markets. Fast forward to 2001, the inside job of taking down the Twin Towers
[01:09.420 --> 01:15.980]  accomplished many things for the corrupt U.S. government. It was the Pearl Harbor event that
[01:15.980 --> 01:22.380]  the neocons wrote they needed to launch their plan for a new American Century. It was the catalyst
[01:22.380 --> 01:28.380]  for the Patriot Act, which is being used today to target American patriots. And it was a way to
[01:28.380 --> 01:35.580]  account for trillions of missing dollars. On the afternoon of September 10, 2001, U.S. Secretary
[01:35.580 --> 01:42.780]  of Defense Donald Rumsfeld announced that the Pentagon was unable to account for $2.3 trillion.
[01:43.500 --> 01:47.900]  The technology revolution has transformed organizations across the private sector.
[01:47.900 --> 01:57.420]  But not ours, not fully, not yet. We are, as they say, tangled in our anchor chain.
[01:58.780 --> 02:04.860]  Our financial systems are decades old. According to some estimates, we cannot track $2.3 trillion
[02:05.500 --> 02:12.860]  in transactions. The very next day, on 9-11, the Pentagon's budget offices took a direct hit
[02:12.860 --> 02:19.100]  and was destroyed. The markets closed for two weeks, banks all across the nation were closed,
[02:19.100 --> 02:26.780]  and the missing $2.3 trillion was forgotten. With overwhelming evidence of 9-11 being a series
[02:26.780 --> 02:34.300]  of controlled demolitions, the debris and wreckage from the felled towers was not investigated. Instead,
[02:34.300 --> 02:39.580]  it was immediately shipped off to China. And on December 11 of that same year,
[02:39.580 --> 02:44.700]  China became a member of the World Trade Organization. Having been given favorable trading
[02:44.700 --> 02:51.500]  status by the U.S., the CCP was virtually exempt from violating human rights violations.
[02:51.500 --> 02:57.900]  And millions of Americans began losing their jobs as manufacturing was outsourced to CCP
[02:57.900 --> 03:03.900]  slave labor factories. Fast forward to the current era. Our government worked with the
[03:03.900 --> 03:10.700]  Communist Chinese to weaponize COVID-19 and to further destabilize the American economy with
[03:10.700 --> 03:17.420]  forced lockdowns and deadly experimental vaccines that are still killing people to this day,
[03:17.420 --> 03:24.060]  including children. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics desperately publishes a fake jobs
[03:24.060 --> 03:32.140]  report claiming over 500,000 jobs when the actual numbers are more like 80,000. The housing market
[03:32.140 --> 03:39.660]  is collapsing. 41% of small businesses can't pay their rent. The U.S. debt is at $31 trillion.
[03:40.620 --> 03:47.580]  The Federal Reserve Bank is backed into a corner, and the crooked U.S. government needs another 9-11.
[03:48.140 --> 03:55.740]  And right on cue, a giant balloon, big enough to be seen by all, slowly creeps across the American
[03:55.740 --> 04:03.900]  skies. The average American is now talking about EMPs. Our government's partner, the CCP, takes
[04:03.900 --> 04:10.860]  credit, and a new bin Laden is born. The stage is now set for an EMP attack so that the banks have
[04:10.860 --> 04:18.060]  an excuse to close, steal the rest of America's wealth, making way for the CCP's digital want
[04:18.060 --> 04:23.180]  to become the new World Reserve currency. They are probing us everywhere, Martha. They're probing
[04:23.180 --> 04:27.980]  us in the Pacific with their fighter aircraft. We had a close incident not too many weeks ago.
[04:27.980 --> 04:32.620]  They're probing us in our home by putting propaganda on TikToks, poisoning our children.
[04:32.620 --> 04:36.300]  They're working in our schools and universities. This is just another example of the Chinese
[04:36.300 --> 04:41.500]  Communist Party's aggression. Why would anyone think that our government is enemies with the
[04:41.500 --> 04:58.140]  Communist Chinese? Reporting for Infowars, this is Greg Rees. All right, ladies and gentlemen, we're live. It's February 8th on this Wednesday edition, 2023. And Greg Rees is absolutely right. The globalists need a new 9-11.

[06:08.060 --> 06:11.500]  It's Wednesday. February 8th, 2023.
[06:11.500 --> 06:23.260]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[06:23.260 --> 06:27.820]  Well, the New World Order and all the horrible things that's done to us and all the even more
[06:27.820 --> 06:36.140]  terrible things that's got planned for us is out in the open. Well, I did not watch the State of
[06:36.140 --> 06:42.300]  the Union by the Puppet President last night live, but I got up at about 4 a.m. and I did watch it.
[06:43.020 --> 06:52.540]  And all I can say is what a sigh by this, putting a geriatric person with serious cognitive decline
[06:53.500 --> 07:02.060]  in the presidency and then walking him out there to act like the ringleader at a legendary clown
[07:02.060 --> 07:08.460]  show. And obviously we got a bunch of clips of it and we can laugh at it, but the joke's on us
[07:08.460 --> 07:12.620]  really at the end of the day that this is what they've done to us, this is what they've installed,
[07:12.620 --> 07:19.260]  this is how they're trying to sabotage civilization. Now we're going to be going over that. We're
[07:19.260 --> 07:23.820]  going to be going over the rollout of the casual society and some big new U.N. developments and
[07:23.820 --> 07:28.860]  how they plan to roll it out here and around different parts of the world. We have Elon Musk
[07:28.860 --> 07:35.580]  coming out and saying it's not supposed to be real. Elon Musk highlights 20-year-old video game,
[07:36.300 --> 07:43.340]  Deus Ex, that predicted a globalist takeover. And what's interesting about this is the video game,
[07:43.340 --> 07:48.220]  and I guess several different versions, was produced and made in Austin, became a big underground hit.
[07:48.860 --> 07:53.740]  I remember talking 16 years ago or so to the makers of it. They were talking to me about
[07:53.740 --> 07:59.180]  being in another version, but I never really paid attention. It never really happened.
[07:59.180 --> 08:02.620]  But what's interesting is, Elon Musk says, everybody else can come back on Twitter, but I
[08:02.620 --> 08:07.340]  can't. I'm the most evil person in the world ever because the misrepresentations of the media of
[08:07.340 --> 08:12.940]  me questioning a mass shooting, but then he basically is becoming the new Alex Jones with
[08:12.940 --> 08:18.860]  hundreds of billions of dollars. So I'm in a paradox. I like a lot of the things Elon Musk is
[08:18.860 --> 08:26.220]  doing, but it's very, very strange to watch him hail a video game that the makers of which,
[08:26.220 --> 08:30.940]  you can pull this up, type in Alex Jones, Deus Ex. You can read articles with them 20 years ago
[08:30.940 --> 08:36.700]  saying it's inspired by a lot of people, but mainly Alex Jones. And then to see Elon Musk
[08:36.700 --> 08:42.860]  hailing the game, but saying that the person that inspired the game is bad.
[08:42.860 --> 08:51.260]  Kind of feels like my identity is being taken or something because the media
[08:54.380 --> 08:58.780]  misrepresents who I am and what I stand for and what I've really said and creates a caricature,
[08:58.780 --> 09:04.620]  but then my work of over 28 years is everywhere and having a great effect thanks to the listeners
[09:04.620 --> 09:09.500]  and viewers that supported the broadcast and magnified the message and the information I had
[09:09.500 --> 09:15.580]  to put out. But to talk about the effect we've had together, it cannot be overestimated and it's
[09:15.580 --> 09:22.940]  been God working through us. So thank God for that. We've got really important poison COVID shot news.
[09:24.780 --> 09:29.420]  I say it every day, really every day of the news just gets bigger. Who can deny that? Victory.
[09:30.380 --> 09:37.340]  California quietly drops COVID-19 vaccine mandate for school children and then we'll
[09:37.340 --> 09:43.180]  go into the rest of the story. Pile and demand Pfizer after the princess falls into coma following
[09:43.180 --> 09:52.060]  booster jab. The most vaccine hesitant group of all PhDs with medical degrees. Those stupid
[09:52.060 --> 09:57.980]  medical people not wanting to take it. Microcarditis after mRNA vaccines explodes. 9 out of 10
[09:57.980 --> 10:03.980]  microcarditis cases now confirmed connected to the shot. But don't worry, the Associated Press,
[10:03.980 --> 10:09.340]  the US military intelligence have joined forces to discredit anyone who is pointing that out.
[10:09.900 --> 10:16.220]  That is the illegal PSYOP going on and in Canada, it's passed the Senate and their parliament
[10:17.580 --> 10:22.700]  to have the government with PSYOP groups from their military control what you can see in
[10:22.700 --> 10:29.580]  live time, officially bringing them into 1984. We also have confirmed reports now that the Pentagon
[10:29.580 --> 10:33.500]  did know of several Chinese balloons that went over the country and the media said Trump did
[10:33.500 --> 10:41.660]  nothing. They made the decision not to tell President Trump. So not his fault, their treasonous
[10:42.300 --> 10:48.220]  fault as they said that president. Absolutely incredible. We have a lot of
[10:49.100 --> 10:54.860]  race war brainwashing news that I want to talk about today just as they turned women against men
[10:55.500 --> 11:02.460]  in the 50s, 60s, 70s and 80s with CIA run Gloria Steinem looking up CIA ran an operation to turn
[11:02.460 --> 11:08.620]  women against men and men against women. It's the same type of PSYOP going on now and they're running
[11:09.740 --> 11:15.100]  news pieces around the country saying that the school lunch program serves children that have
[11:15.100 --> 11:21.900]  to be black chicken, fried chicken, it's racist. Well they need some bugs, I'm sure that's better.
[11:21.900 --> 11:28.140]  Just the way they take everything and weaponize it ladies and gentlemen, that oh it's a weird
[11:28.140 --> 11:33.180]  northern trope I guess for northerners, nothing it's northerners that never really ate fried
[11:33.180 --> 11:37.980]  chicken to think oh black people are moving up here and they eat fried chicken they're weird.
[11:39.900 --> 11:46.060]  That's just a southern dish ladies and gentlemen but again this is the black children it's horrible
[11:46.060 --> 11:53.500]  they served us fried chicken on the menu during black history month we know it's a secret attack.
[11:53.500 --> 11:58.380]  Don't worry they'll be feeding you bugs quick enough you won't have to complain about fried chicken
[11:58.380 --> 12:10.540]  anymore but it gets even worse on the fruit menu of strawberries and grapes was also watermelon.
[12:10.540 --> 12:21.340]  Oh my goodness and it gets even worse baked beans and a banana you know it's funny when I saw that menu
[12:21.340 --> 12:30.140]  I had been at a brunch with my wife and five-year-old daughter two weeks ago and my daughter
[12:30.140 --> 12:38.140]  when she went through the brunch line with all the dozens of choices she chose fried chicken
[12:38.140 --> 12:42.780]  waffles and watermelon which you know my five-year-old daughter did it to be mean to black people.
[12:42.780 --> 12:46.620]  She didn't want to eat waffles she didn't want to eat fried chicken she didn't want a piece of
[12:46.620 --> 12:54.860]  watermelon and grapes no ladies and gentlemen she too was channeling Adolf Hitler.
[12:54.860 --> 13:00.460]  Meanwhile they're injecting children of every color with deadly poison the destroyer fertility
[13:00.460 --> 13:06.540]  and massively increases their chances of cardiovascular disease but that's liberal and loving that's
[13:06.540 --> 13:12.940]  brought to you by Pfizer during the satanic Grammys that's okay so we got a big stack that's just
[13:12.940 --> 13:17.980]  one of the articles I've got one of the newscast about just the terribleness of the school they're
[13:17.980 --> 13:31.580]  so sorry they were insensitive that they gave the school that's has black students in it fried chicken.
[13:31.580 --> 13:36.540]  It's just folks I I mean I'm calling on grocery stores in Austin like ATB to stop selling fried chicken at their
[13:36.540 --> 13:43.900]  counter because it's popular but it's secretly racist too and they sell watermelons in the produce department
[13:43.900 --> 13:53.180]  and you can buy waffle mix too see man this dog whistle of racism is everywhere I call for banning
[13:53.180 --> 14:03.740]  watermelon I call for banning fried chicken and baked beans and just anything black people have ever
[14:03.740 --> 14:09.980]  eaten or life it's just gotta be banned right now and again that sounds ridiculous this is ridiculous but
[14:09.980 --> 14:15.500]  that's the level of mind control while they take all of our rights put us all into slavery big
[14:15.500 --> 14:20.700]  government the media Disney I've got the articles are all promoting this and you've got these hyper
[14:20.700 --> 14:25.740]  sensitive angry black people out there the majority of black folks aren't buying into it but I mean we
[14:25.740 --> 14:32.940]  do see the folks on the news and the reports and it's just everywhere really entitled angry black
[14:32.940 --> 14:39.100]  people particularly young black people attacking their servers attacking anybody believing they've
[14:39.100 --> 14:44.460]  been slided in any way and this is how they put a chip on people's shoulders that's why we've got
[14:44.460 --> 14:49.900]  all these 40 50 60 year old 70 year old feminist women who are dying alone at home with their cats
[14:51.580 --> 14:55.740]  because they were taught to hate men and never be around men now by the time they get 45 or 50
[14:55.740 --> 15:03.100]  45 or 50 they start desperately trying to get a man but they can't so they die alone they should
[15:03.100 --> 15:08.220]  complete it and it's the same thing they're trying to handicap black people by putting chips on their
[15:08.220 --> 15:14.300]  shoulders so they act completely out of control like everybody's out to get them and then they
[15:14.300 --> 15:19.100]  can't work with anybody because they're so screwed up this is how you bring down a society and then
[15:19.100 --> 15:24.380]  they've got the five-year-olds being taught they're really a girl and they're a boy and vice versa
[15:24.380 --> 15:29.500]  that's meant to sabotage society the fentanyl is meant to sabotage society cutting off the
[15:29.500 --> 15:33.980]  energies meant to sabotage society and look i know the listeners of this show know that but
[15:33.980 --> 15:38.380]  we got to reach out to all these people under my control and say listen you're being jacked with
[15:38.380 --> 15:42.780]  really hard here so that you'll be a complete loser independent on the system that wants to kill
[15:42.780 --> 15:50.220]  your ass so we've got that news as well so much more this is going to be a big broadcast today

[19:50.860 --> 19:55.420]  of the rest of our lives this is our fight and i'm proud of humanity the globalists even admit
[19:55.420 --> 19:59.340]  it's leaked they're very upset that they're losing and and that this hasn't gone the way they thought
[19:59.340 --> 20:07.660]  it would leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order it's alex jones
[20:07.660 --> 20:25.260]  a clown president for a clown country puppet president installed by the nwo joe biden last
[20:25.260 --> 20:34.620]  night in the stumbling bumbling lying diatribe that was the state of the union state of the union
[20:34.620 --> 20:43.900]  crashing and burning under the threads of the globalist onslaught no mistake if you try anything
[20:43.900 --> 20:51.980]  to raise the cost of president jobs i will veto it i said we're going to need oil for at least
[20:51.980 --> 21:00.940]  another decade and that's going to exceed it and beyond that we're going to need it production
[21:00.940 --> 21:09.500]  so a cashier at a burger place can't walk across town and take the same job another
[21:09.500 --> 21:14.220]  burger place to make a few bucks more it just changed but they just changed it because we
[21:14.220 --> 21:23.180]  exposed it that was part of the deal guys look it up but not anymore fast food restaurants have
[21:23.180 --> 21:27.020]  never had non-competes it's another total lie i mean there's hundreds of these cliffs
[21:27.020 --> 21:30.460]  we could just start the thing at the start and spend the whole show playing clips and commenting
[21:30.460 --> 21:38.940]  on it state of disunion dim celebrate republican years 72 percent approve of the speech yeah and
[21:38.940 --> 21:43.580]  what alternate universe over there at the drudge report whatever happened the poor old drudge report
[21:45.180 --> 21:52.540]  now continuing here let's play clip seven that's uh quite a whopper two years ago cobert had shut
[21:52.540 --> 21:59.660]  down our businesses closed our schools and robbed us of so much today cobert no longer controls our
[21:59.660 --> 22:07.100]  lives let's analyze that 11-second clip before i play it two years ago it was actually three years
[22:07.100 --> 22:14.220]  ago the hysteria the chinese siob the big tech siob working with the actual pentagon and foreign
[22:14.220 --> 22:19.740]  defense ministries created fear on purpose of a virus that was about as dangerous as the flu
[22:19.740 --> 22:25.660]  to then roll out a shot that is way way way way way more dangerous on record so it was the globalist
[22:25.660 --> 22:30.300]  that robbed us of our freedom and put mask on our kids and pushed poison shots on the public and
[22:31.180 --> 22:36.860]  starved the third world to death in two years of lockdowns under the imf and world bank but oh
[22:36.860 --> 22:42.700]  here he is now we've now defeated cobert we're now out of it because the public woke up to the power
[22:42.700 --> 22:47.500]  grab and said no to the shots and yes to therapeutics here's the clip years ago
[22:47.500 --> 22:55.660]  cobert had shut down our businesses were closed our schools were robbed of so much and today
[22:55.660 --> 23:04.700]  cobert no longer controls our lives he went on to say he'd saved us uh wow and it just goes on
[23:04.700 --> 23:10.140]  it just goes on from there i mean i don't know how much of this we should really really play here
[23:10.140 --> 23:14.380]  let's play clip 12 let's have the real president whether you love him or hate him he really did win
[23:14.380 --> 23:19.420]  reelection he really did piss off the new world order here's trump's response to the state of the
[23:19.420 --> 23:28.140]  so-called union here's the real state of the union over the past two years under biden millions and
[23:28.140 --> 23:35.020]  millions of illegal aliens from 160 different countries have stormed across our southern border
[23:35.020 --> 23:41.980]  drug cartels are now raking in billions of dollars from smuggling poison to kill our people and to
[23:41.980 --> 23:47.900]  kill our children savage killers rapists and violent criminals are being released from jail
[23:48.540 --> 23:53.580]  to continue their crime wave and under biden the murder rate has reached the highest
[23:54.380 --> 24:00.380]  in the history of our country biden and the radical democrats have wasted trillions of dollars
[24:00.380 --> 24:07.980]  and caused the worst inflation in half a century real wages are down 21 months in a row gas prices
[24:07.980 --> 24:14.140]  have soared and are now going up much higher than even before and the typical american family is
[24:14.140 --> 24:23.180]  paying 2200 and increased energy and food costs each year joe biden's weaponized justice department
[24:23.180 --> 24:30.060]  and i'm a victim of it is persecuting his political opponents his administration is waging war and
[24:30.060 --> 24:36.140]  free speech they're trying to indoctrinate and mutilate our children he's leading us to the
[24:36.140 --> 24:42.380]  brink of world war three and on top of all of that he's the most corrupt president in american
[24:42.380 --> 24:48.940]  history and it's not even close but the good news is we are going to reverse every single crisis
[24:48.940 --> 24:57.420]  calamity and disaster that joe biden has created i am running for president to end the destruction
[24:57.420 --> 25:03.980]  of our country and to complete the unfinished business of making america great again we will
[25:03.980 --> 25:11.980]  make our country better than ever before and we will always put america first thank you
[25:13.980 --> 25:20.940]  well everything trump said there is true but he still leaves the poisonous elephant in the room
[25:21.740 --> 25:25.180]  and that is the poison shots though he's starting to more and more back away from it that's a
[25:26.220 --> 25:29.180]  that's a good thing i want to open the phones up
[25:29.180 --> 25:35.820]  for first time callers today at least in the first round the first 20 or so that come in
[25:35.820 --> 25:43.420]  then after that it's a free for all on the state of the union on the war in europe that's expanding
[25:44.300 --> 25:52.620]  on the race spading on the grammys of the satan worship on this latest transgender news i'm
[25:52.620 --> 26:01.260]  going to beginning to on deus x and the different things that elon must has been saying and so much
[26:01.260 --> 26:07.900]  more so it's basically a free for all any topic any issue you want to bring up but i would imagine
[26:07.900 --> 26:14.380]  you'd want to call in and comment on some of this in fact here's a question i'd like to get
[26:14.380 --> 26:20.700]  response to if you choose to call in on this subject is how much worse can this get with
[26:20.700 --> 26:25.020]  biden and i know they meant to demoralize this and have a puppet they could blame for their
[26:25.020 --> 26:28.700]  agenda but man this is going a lot worse than they even thought that's why they're trying to
[26:28.700 --> 26:33.820]  offload him how do you think biden ends how do they extricate themselves when kamala Harris is
[26:33.820 --> 26:38.940]  just as bad or worse i mean literally mentally ill can hardly talk i don't think they want
[26:38.940 --> 26:44.220]  mccarty in there that he's third in line so would they assassinate biden and and and and
[26:44.220 --> 26:48.780]  blow up harris at the same time and then put mccarty in you know my mom the smart lady she
[26:48.780 --> 26:54.620]  thinks they're going to kill biden as a type of false flag how do you think biden ends and
[26:54.620 --> 26:59.820]  what do you think the globalists are going to pull next because everywhere their agenda is falling
[26:59.820 --> 27:07.420]  apart i'm going to cover when we come back the covid news that is so incredibly important
[27:07.420 --> 27:12.060]  and the big developments on that front some good news and some also very very horrifying news
[27:12.060 --> 27:25.180]  but the toll free number to join us is 877-789-2539-877-789 alex 877-789-2539 we can also talk about
[27:25.740 --> 27:31.420]  the balloon and someone the left said oh balloons flew over several times and trump did nothing
[27:32.460 --> 27:39.900]  they're now confirming that the joint chief of staff and his chief of staff was formerly
[27:39.900 --> 27:50.300]  independent on chose to not tell the president so this is a big deal and shows the treason
[27:50.940 --> 27:55.500]  of the deep state and how they had this giant intelligence operation against us but they never
[27:55.500 --> 28:04.620]  actually tell us what are real dangerous died in the wall enemies are doing 877-789-2539
[28:04.620 --> 28:11.180]  and we've got some great footage of mtg saying that biden's a liar last night yelling at him
[28:11.180 --> 28:17.180]  and then also her with the gavel when she uh brought the state of the union into
[28:18.460 --> 28:23.900]  session so we're going to come out of break and play play both those clips but i really like
[28:23.900 --> 28:31.900]  mtg she's got a lot of moxie and a lot of spunk and you know so far we're seeing a lot of good
[28:31.900 --> 28:37.020]  stuff out of this new congress i think that's because mccarty is leading by such a small margin
[28:37.580 --> 28:42.940]  that that freedom caucus that patriot caucus had american first caucus call what you will
[28:42.940 --> 28:47.340]  has got him on a very short lease but i'd like to see impeachment begin against biden right now
[28:47.340 --> 28:51.260]  and a polian would say don't interrupt an enemy while they're destroying themselves well he's
[28:51.260 --> 28:55.980]  destroying us the same time we have responsibility to remove his damn ass not some clown spectacle
[28:55.980 --> 29:01.260]  to turn laugh that it's deadly serious in my view what do you think the good news is the real red

[34:32.380 --> 34:40.300]  significant but it's being proposed by individuals i'm not politely not naming them but it's being
[34:40.300 --> 34:52.860]  proposed by some of you look folks the idea is that we're not going to be we're not going to be
[34:52.860 --> 35:13.020]  moved into being threatened to default on the debt if we don't respond oh we're in the danger zone
[35:13.020 --> 35:18.460]  all right and both parties are guilty of the democrats are in the lead in the guilt department
[35:18.460 --> 35:23.580]  they're the ones that are just rampaging forward without a control spending that is a
[35:23.580 --> 35:29.820]  debt default because it will make the currency insolvent very soon if not imminently they're
[35:29.820 --> 35:33.580]  going to bring in their new global currency that i'm going to get to later that are preparing
[35:34.220 --> 35:38.460]  we've already got loaded phone lines i want to just start taking your phone calls
[35:38.460 --> 35:43.660]  but as i mentioned let me hit just today this is a small spattering of it of the covid news
[35:43.660 --> 35:48.620]  this is very good news this is going to save a lot of lives and these children
[35:48.620 --> 35:52.540]  deserve to be able to grow up make their own decisions whether they want to soft kill and
[35:52.540 --> 36:00.540]  euthanize themselves victory california quietly drops covid-19 vaccine mandate for school
[36:00.540 --> 36:05.740]  children but the schools are still going to try to claim it's a mandate and bully the children
[36:06.620 --> 36:13.020]  so a mandate's not a law it's a bluff it's a fraud and then removing the mandate that
[36:13.020 --> 36:17.500]  itself's a bluff but still acting like there's a mandate that's a bluff of a bluff of a bluff
[36:18.460 --> 36:23.580]  california state leaders appear to have quietly abandoned plans to impose covid-19 vaccine
[36:23.580 --> 36:28.780]  mandates for school children california's department of public health confirmed friday
[36:28.780 --> 36:34.220]  that k-12 school students will no longer be required to take the experimental covid jab
[36:34.220 --> 36:41.100]  to attend the classes but how many of the little darlings already got poisoned this is now confirmed
[36:41.100 --> 36:46.140]  this is in the thailand news the princess took her third shot a day later collapsed the blood
[36:46.140 --> 36:51.900]  clots in her brain and a coma probably will die now they're saying the government is going to ban
[36:51.900 --> 36:57.100]  the phyzer jab well the modern is the same thing just four times stronger after ty princess falls
[36:57.100 --> 37:02.700]  into coma following booster jab i wonder if a prince can come and kiss her and take her out of the
[37:02.700 --> 37:09.020]  deep sleep i don't mean that as a joke it's so sad the most vaccine hesitant group of all phd's
[37:09.020 --> 37:19.580]  and above that group it's medical doctors so there you go that's the herald dot com big
[37:19.580 --> 37:32.300]  article big study the most hesitant group is phd's isn't that interesting but the educated idiots
[37:32.300 --> 37:35.500]  and i'm not putting you down i have a masters but you know what i mean that i've just been given the
[37:35.500 --> 37:42.380]  first couple years of indoctrination the first four years they with the bachelors and the masters
[37:42.380 --> 37:51.580]  are the groups that are taking it the most extremely revealing hey folks with high school
[37:52.700 --> 37:58.300]  are almost as smart as the phd people are wise and are the second largest group saying no some
[37:58.300 --> 38:11.420]  college say no so 20 percent are hesitant on high school some college 18 percent bachelors
[38:12.060 --> 38:19.820]  11 percent masters 8 percent professionals 12 percent and phd's 23.9 and you know they took
[38:19.820 --> 38:28.540]  out of a test group that's more leftist because the real numbers are over 80 percent of americans
[38:28.540 --> 38:36.300]  don't trust the shot now in major polls that is a big deal here's another big report bombshell
[38:36.300 --> 38:42.940]  microcarditis that's heart swelling after mRNA vaccines and it reports here in a new major study
[38:42.940 --> 38:50.300]  read it for yourself that the majority nine out of ten people that are having microcarditis
[38:50.300 --> 38:55.740]  that's exploded around the world where the shots are given it's been directly linked to the injection
[38:58.380 --> 39:02.940]  but the system's countering that associated press and us military intelligence and i told you ap is
[39:02.940 --> 39:09.580]  cia all the way so it should be cia not associated press and us military intelligence joined forces
[39:09.580 --> 39:14.940]  to discredit viral hashtag died suddenly trend even though it's insurance companies and government
[39:14.940 --> 39:21.500]  leaders and top statisticians at mit and harvard and yale saying the same thing
[39:23.260 --> 39:29.260]  oh don't worry the pentagon is going to work with them with the controlled media to brainwash people
[39:31.260 --> 39:34.620]  meanwhile there's a veritas news report out
[39:34.620 --> 39:42.700]  and they just simply pulled up old articles when obama was in office where they hailed obama
[39:44.380 --> 39:47.100]  for building bio weapon labs in ukraine
[39:49.260 --> 39:55.340]  nine years ago but the media tells you it's a fact check nothing exists i said nine years ago
[39:55.340 --> 40:01.660]  it's longer than that president obama wants to visit ukraine to unveil us funding for anti-plug
[40:01.660 --> 40:07.660]  labs in 2005 the funding was used for security upgrades for the soviet era bio facilities
[40:07.660 --> 40:12.460]  once used for secret bio weapons programs we now know hunter biden was involved in with joe biden
[40:12.460 --> 40:20.300]  weaponizing viruses but it's bipartisan evil here's mike pompeo will queue this up this
[40:21.180 --> 40:26.620]  user on twitter hui media said i personally trust alex jones way more than i trust the cia
[40:26.620 --> 40:33.340]  a especially when people from the cia are on camera saying things like this here's pompeo
[40:33.340 --> 40:39.100]  bragging about special classes and how to lie here it is what's the cadet motto at west point
[40:39.100 --> 40:44.860]  you will not lie cheat or steal or tolerate those who do i i was the ci director we lied we
[40:44.860 --> 40:51.020]  cheated we steal stole it's like we we had we had entire we had entire training courses
[40:51.020 --> 40:58.220]  uh but of course you don't even need people to lie when they're just willing participants
[40:58.220 --> 41:02.060]  and just believe whatever they're told and have stockham syndrome that's why statistically
[41:03.500 --> 41:10.380]  and they'll teach you this in advertising class women are more trusting now some of the smartest
[41:10.380 --> 41:15.660]  and wisest and canny people i know are women i'm not saying women aren't some of the shrewd as people
[41:15.660 --> 41:21.740]  other but i'm saying on average any woman will tell you the shrewd women are very very gullible
[41:21.740 --> 41:26.620]  compared to men and men are incredibly gullible too but i'm just saying the whole system's targeting
[41:26.620 --> 41:29.820]  women because women want to work with the system and they don't want to believe they're being hurt
[41:29.820 --> 41:32.700]  they don't believe they're in a scam or an abusive relationship with a government
[41:33.660 --> 41:38.940]  or corporations so they have as their spokespersons women in in lab coats women in medical coats
[41:38.940 --> 41:45.340]  women in pharmacy outfits saying oh it's totally safe for women to take this experimental untested
[41:45.340 --> 41:50.780]  shot that we now have the new england medical journal a year ago saying oh my god 84 increase
[41:50.780 --> 41:55.500]  in miscarriages in the first two trimesters something like an 18 percent in the third i mean
[41:55.500 --> 42:01.340]  it's been devastating and the actuary show from the insurance companies the medical reports record
[42:01.340 --> 42:06.460]  stillbirths and miscarriages and they're giving you an experimental shot directly linked to it
[42:06.460 --> 42:12.620]  but oh they're still out there at walgreens she was told to do this by the pr department she
[42:12.620 --> 42:17.100]  doesn't know she hasn't researched all the other drugs she's got are approved did have research
[42:17.100 --> 42:23.580]  background sometimes they fudge it sometimes it's a lie like vioxx or oxy cotton but but still she
[42:23.580 --> 42:28.540]  knows well i went to school of course it's approved it's safe it's good no it wasn't here she is

[47:06.060 --> 47:14.540]  it's alex jones
[47:17.100 --> 47:24.460]  the grid it's being built all around us we have billions of humans that are aware of it
[47:24.460 --> 47:28.540]  and begin to stand up against it we can build our own system the grid
[47:28.540 --> 47:37.020]  that's a digital frontier i tried to think too close to some information as they moved
[47:37.020 --> 47:44.620]  through the computer what did they look like now listen to me carefully motorcycles i'm up here
[47:44.620 --> 47:51.340]  very calm because the hour is very late you don't need me to tell you how much danger we're all in
[47:51.340 --> 47:59.180]  right now i'm getting chills from the bottom of my feet a very tip top my head
[48:01.980 --> 48:11.340]  we're gonna look back on these days as halcyon better get right with god the danger is very great
[48:14.700 --> 48:19.340]  i can intellectually see it i can politically research it i can mathematically equate it
[48:19.340 --> 48:31.100]  the gut the gut is the connection to god the mind the soul and beyond and they're getting ready
[48:32.380 --> 48:37.340]  to create a crisis whether it's a giant terror attack or a cyber attack that cuts the power
[48:38.300 --> 48:44.060]  to jump the rails fully onto their system the cobit release was just the training wheels
[48:44.060 --> 48:49.100]  for this takeover now people are waking up people are speaking out people are saying no but not
[48:49.100 --> 48:55.020]  fast enough and not strong enough because it sounds so crazy to get up here and lay out all
[48:55.020 --> 49:01.820]  these horrible things that are unfolding but if you don't face the horror and if you don't realize
[49:01.820 --> 49:07.180]  that submission is death resistance is victory then we don't have any hope but if you simply wake
[49:07.180 --> 49:11.900]  up to the nightmare and admit we're all in trouble then we can dig out of this together very easily
[49:11.900 --> 49:16.540]  we have a lot of power and we have got on our side now i'm not going to do a whole show on this
[49:16.540 --> 49:22.700]  i've probably done 30 40 reports i've had probably 100 guests on about it but if you go back to the
[49:22.700 --> 49:27.020]  emails that came out from whistleblowers and eco health alliance two and a half almost three years
[49:27.020 --> 49:33.420]  ago they said hey listen we were working on a cobit 19 vaccine for a chimeric virus years before
[49:33.420 --> 49:39.500]  this happened the exact virus and then there were clips of peter dazik admitting it and all of this
[49:39.500 --> 49:47.900]  was in 2019 before they did it you say why do they do that well later if it comes out they
[49:47.900 --> 49:56.140]  say well of course i told you we did but there's a new clip of the ceo maderna and they put out
[49:56.140 --> 50:02.620]  the same thing as Pfizer just put one of four shots in one and he said he knew there was going
[50:02.620 --> 50:08.940]  to be a pandemic and they had the vaccine ready in 2019 now we already know that from the documents
[50:08.940 --> 50:16.940]  two and a half years ago we broke that we harped on it but the issue is why are they now going
[50:16.940 --> 50:20.860]  around giving speeches interviews admitting it because they know it's coming out now they know
[50:20.860 --> 50:28.700]  the public's finally ready to face that information they created the virus they released it they
[50:28.700 --> 50:33.340]  created the poison shots they had them ready they'd already tested them on animals they knew it
[50:33.340 --> 50:39.420]  caused heart attacks the microchartitis blood clots it's in the 2000 document from the cdc in
[50:39.420 --> 50:47.100]  october predicting everything that happened and you say well why would they admit something like that
[50:49.260 --> 50:52.700]  well there's a lot of good people in the government that are whistleblowers that put those reports out
[50:54.540 --> 51:00.220]  but also because the system allows that because it knows it's going to come out later and they
[51:00.220 --> 51:06.460]  want to act like they were investigating and just weren't sure so this is sick ladies and gentlemen
[51:07.820 --> 51:13.900]  here is the modernist ceo a little bit into the new variants and sub variants and i'm going to go
[51:13.900 --> 51:18.460]  with the stefan ban so let's talk about vaccine development because we've heard how it happened
[51:18.460 --> 51:24.060]  obviously with kovat 19 starting from 2022 and how extraordinary the process was also in terms of
[51:24.060 --> 51:29.100]  the speed how is development adoption and scaling of vaccine going on when it comes for different
[51:29.100 --> 51:34.780]  variants and sub variants because this is one of the big concerns as we as we're all here now and
[51:34.780 --> 51:40.620]  we're discussing when we understand the context and this is a great deal sure a good morning and
[51:40.620 --> 51:47.820]  thank you for having me on the panel so the great news versus 2020 where we are today is we have
[51:47.820 --> 51:54.940]  manufacturing capacity as sef knows when the pandemic happened more than a hundred thousand
[51:54.940 --> 52:01.500]  dollars in 2019 for the whole year and i remember walking after that was into the office of my
[52:01.500 --> 52:05.980]  other manufacturing and i say how we make a billion dollars next year and you look at me a bit funny
[52:05.980 --> 52:12.940]  say what i say i want to make a billion dollars next year is going to be a pandemic so maderna
[52:12.940 --> 52:19.180]  is this whole globalist consortium created right before cover 19 he says in 2019 we created
[52:19.180 --> 52:26.460]  an x number of doses he said how do we make a bunch of money next year
[52:27.340 --> 52:33.980]  they're just hiding it in plain view in front of everybody like it's hilarious and what came
[52:33.980 --> 52:40.540]  out two weeks ago in the project veritas undercover video their head of global mRNA who never even got
[52:40.540 --> 52:48.620]  his medical degree never finished his residency never got his degree in a white lab coat people
[52:48.620 --> 52:53.020]  said oh this guy can't be real later you find the videos and photos of him as their global head
[52:56.540 --> 53:01.020]  telling you it's totally safe and effective and he says the project veritas look i'm just a salesman
[53:01.020 --> 53:08.700]  i just lie to people it's no big deal i just lie yeah you're hired like albert borla the head of
[53:08.700 --> 53:14.700]  the company who used to deliver dogs and cats at a veterinary clinic and you look at the whole list
[53:14.700 --> 53:19.500]  of who they got up there they're not even virologists or scientists or geneticists they're just the
[53:19.500 --> 53:24.380]  front company as dr peter mccullough said what he was on last week for the military industrial
[53:24.380 --> 53:29.900]  complex that already made this and created the us and then acted like it came out of the wuhan lab
[53:29.900 --> 53:35.500]  they just did that as their cover story and left it all nebulous like oh it's not out of a lab to
[53:35.500 --> 53:39.980]  hold that over china go on what we're doing you know do what we say you're in the new world order
[53:39.980 --> 53:44.860]  we released a bio weapon just work with us and and and we won't say you did it and china day
[53:44.860 --> 53:49.420]  once said it's the pentagon that came out of the united states which it did and i'm not defending
[53:49.420 --> 53:55.340]  zizi ping he certainly used it for a power grab now what else is all over the news every day we see
[53:55.340 --> 54:00.700]  the new studies out cancer is the highest rate it's ever been not just in old people or children
[54:01.900 --> 54:03.660]  but people they're 30s and 40s
[54:03.660 --> 54:14.780]  cancer is striking more people in their late 30s and 40s here's what you need to know
[54:17.580 --> 54:21.660]  cancer is striking more people in their 30s and 40s here which you need to know oh it's just totally
[54:21.660 --> 54:27.980]  normal remember two and a half years ago when the shot started in england they said well it'll
[54:27.980 --> 54:33.900]  look like you have cancer when you go to the oncologist or go to the doctor
[54:37.660 --> 54:42.220]  but don't worry about it just don't treat it just like oh you're coming with this really
[54:42.220 --> 54:45.740]  bad cough and cold and can't breathe don't give you drugs don't give you anything to help you
[54:45.740 --> 54:49.260]  don't give you therapeutics just come back when you're dying we'll put a ventilator in you and get
[54:49.260 --> 54:53.340]  50 plus thousand dollars for the federal government to kill your ass and the same bounty program
[54:53.340 --> 54:57.900]  was run all over the western world the shots were given this is a hundred percent premeditated
[54:57.900 --> 55:04.460]  on record to test bringing out a poison giving it to you not treating you killing you and then
[55:04.460 --> 55:08.860]  sitting back and laughing all the way to the bank and corrupting the entire medical media system in
[55:08.860 --> 55:14.380]  the process they want to kill us they want to populate us this is how they do it and they're
[55:14.380 --> 55:24.140]  testing to see what they can get away with and remember what bill gates famously said we're
[55:24.140 --> 55:28.460]  we're taking genetically modified organisms and we're injecting them into little kids arms we're
[55:28.460 --> 55:34.860]  shooting them right in the vein and he gets on to say we have no idea what it'll do but Sean Penn
[55:34.860 --> 55:40.620]  says if someone chooses not to take a COVID vaccine they should choose to stay home not go to work
[55:40.620 --> 55:47.420]  and not have a job we're gonna break in about two minutes come back in the second and third hour

[59:44.620 --> 59:46.140]  alexjoneslive.com
[59:46.140 --> 59:57.260]  leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order it's alex jones
[01:00:03.900 --> 01:00:11.580]  china is testing china is manipulating china is seeing how far they can go with these probes
[01:00:11.580 --> 01:00:16.620]  and when you put it together with their confusion societies and six billion dollars a year in the
[01:00:16.620 --> 01:00:21.660]  us universities to control academia and bio politicians and you look at their acquisition
[01:00:21.660 --> 01:00:26.060]  of the media and the fact that they own four of the six big production houses in hollywood
[01:00:26.060 --> 01:00:32.140]  lacking farmland china has struggled to secure food for its 1.4 billion citizens just recently
[01:00:32.140 --> 01:00:36.940]  in august four chinese government departments warned a drought posed a severe threat to the
[01:00:36.940 --> 01:00:43.260]  autumn harvest that has driven overseas investments in food including the purchase of virginia-based
[01:00:43.260 --> 01:00:49.580]  pork producer smithfield foods and partnership with growmark a grain logistics firm this entire
[01:00:49.580 --> 01:00:55.740]  system we see is being foisted by a handful of corporations and the chinese communist
[01:00:55.740 --> 01:01:00.300]  the people that run our country are out to get us they're at war with us on every front and you
[01:01:00.300 --> 01:01:06.940]  already know that but as soon as we can get the bureaucrats and and and the woke left us to just
[01:01:06.940 --> 01:01:12.220]  pull back and understand that they've been stock home syndromeed and that they're helping their
[01:01:12.220 --> 01:01:17.740]  own abusers and destroyers and they're pretending like they're part of some liberal revolution
[01:01:17.740 --> 01:01:22.620]  to create a utopia as soon as they realize that this liberal utopia is meant to bring in total
[01:01:22.620 --> 01:01:28.140]  autocratic tyranny and then they're going to have a backlash and ban the entire leftist system
[01:01:28.140 --> 01:01:33.580]  that they've injected into us to only paralyze us in the next phase of the new world order program
[01:01:33.580 --> 01:01:37.500]  ladies and gentlemen it's going to be eugenics all the way and but they intend on making the world
[01:01:37.500 --> 01:01:45.340]  so hellish in the build-up to 2030 that everybody'll just wink wink when they release the ray specific
[01:01:45.340 --> 01:01:52.300]  bio weapons starting with africa that are going to wipe that continent absolutely out the facts
[01:01:52.300 --> 01:01:58.380]  are china has put a lot of money into high altitude balloons for what you call satellite
[01:01:58.380 --> 01:02:04.380]  arrays surveillance arrays but more importantly communication systems but they've also put a
[01:02:04.380 --> 01:02:11.660]  lot of money in to deliver a electromagnetic pulse weapon that's detonated and powered by an
[01:02:11.660 --> 01:02:17.980]  atomic or hydrogen bomb going off it's estimated that a 40 megaton bomb that's a medium-sized bomb
[01:02:17.980 --> 01:02:23.980]  would knock out large portions of the united states that was detonated around 80 000 feet in the right
[01:02:23.980 --> 01:02:31.420]  conditions but there's more radiation that goes further at night because of radiation that's already
[01:02:31.420 --> 01:02:36.460]  in the atmosphere from the sun and so they would try to detonate these at night they would have much
[01:02:36.460 --> 01:02:41.660]  bigger effect you see what solar flares do wreaking havoc with satellites that's nothing
[01:02:41.660 --> 01:02:49.340]  that's nothing compared to this and the fact that biden didn't order this shot down day one uh the
[01:02:49.340 --> 01:02:56.220]  fact that the communist chinese confirmed it was theirs just shows you what the board patrol said
[01:02:56.220 --> 01:03:00.380]  they're not watching the border they're not watching anything except us order the pentagon
[01:03:00.380 --> 01:03:05.980]  to shoot it down on wednesday as soon as possible they decided that the best time to do that was
[01:03:05.980 --> 01:03:12.220]  as it got over water outside within our within 12 mile limit and then you have hunter biden with
[01:03:12.220 --> 01:03:16.620]  the laptop and saying he works for chinese intelligence and all the classified documents at
[01:03:16.620 --> 01:03:23.180]  the house he was renting for 50 grand a month from his dad these are all just absolutely pieces of proof
[01:03:24.300 --> 01:03:30.780]  that the bidens are chinese communists agents one hundred thousand dollars a month as a retainer
[01:03:30.780 --> 01:03:37.580]  for hunter biden to work for a chinese entity with ties to the chinese communist party 500
[01:03:37.580 --> 01:03:45.980]  thousand dollars right off the top as a one-time payment to hunter and 65 000 a month for james
[01:03:45.980 --> 01:03:53.660]  biden the president's brother but we're talking about something that goes beyond simply an appearance
[01:03:53.660 --> 01:03:59.260]  we're talking about the question of what could hunter biden possibly bring to the table for this
[01:03:59.260 --> 01:04:04.300]  chinese company to pay him these astronomical sums of money and this has gone now beyond
[01:04:04.300 --> 01:04:09.420]  sort of the partisan witch hunt i don't think that that democrats can make that claim anymore
[01:04:09.980 --> 01:04:14.620]  the fact that this has been going on is important yes the globalist set up china but by the time
[01:04:14.620 --> 01:04:19.100]  gg ping came along and now he's arrested his predecessor that was working with the globalist
[01:04:19.900 --> 01:04:26.300]  gg ping has told big tech of the new world order i'm in charge and i'm not to deal with you anymore
[01:04:26.300 --> 01:04:30.700]  and so just like stahl and hitler for the first two years world war two had a deal
[01:04:30.700 --> 01:04:56.540]  and then hitler broke it it's the same story again
[01:04:56.540 --> 01:05:07.900]  well i did want to say about diet force diet force is amazing i'm 45 and i have bits i go to the gym

[01:07:38.060 --> 01:07:42.140]  based on me and the new world order and the plan to release the virus to control the population
[01:07:42.140 --> 01:07:46.860]  to bring in world government and then people go and look up variety and hollywood reporter and go
[01:07:46.860 --> 01:07:53.260]  wow uh chris carter really said that it's not about me getting credit it's about credit for all
[01:07:53.260 --> 01:07:58.380]  of you that supported the broadcast all of our guests everything we did that we were dead on
[01:07:58.380 --> 01:08:03.180]  and now elon musk is giving it credit for everything but not giving me credit and look
[01:08:03.180 --> 01:08:07.820]  i like overall what he's doing with free speech and the rest of it saying our population's going

[01:08:24.620 --> 01:08:33.180]  alex jones even matri media says that but then i'm still the bad guy elon musk is not stupid and
[01:08:33.180 --> 01:08:38.860]  he knows the misrepresentations about me are not accurate uh and so i i'm just simply asking musk

[01:09:19.820 --> 01:09:24.300]  the highest rated and then i say can you make it stronger i want a private labeling and then i know
[01:09:24.300 --> 01:09:29.020]  i'm selling the very best thing there is you know i've done some other stuff like gone to a top
[01:09:29.020 --> 01:09:32.540]  producer and said what are your best selling products and those are more like bodybuilding
[01:09:32.540 --> 01:09:36.860]  things and then that's a whole different genre so so that's that's that's different than the health
[01:09:36.860 --> 01:09:43.100]  nut that's more of a results based thing within fours platinum uh but uh yeah that's where we're
[01:09:43.100 --> 01:09:47.980]  at so thanks thanks for the support sir what what's on your mind about biden's assassination and
[01:09:47.980 --> 01:09:53.820]  media lies well it's exception i mean it's easy you said that they uh they've made masks that and
[01:09:54.620 --> 01:09:58.460]  where they fooled the president with him you know they were in the same room with them they took
[01:09:58.460 --> 01:10:02.940]  the mask off he didn't even know the mask was there so i know that there's a way of killing him
[01:10:02.940 --> 01:10:07.820]  um i know that they need him out of the way it's just with kamala harris being the second
[01:10:07.820 --> 01:10:13.740]  as a vp and then us now having the house i'm confused about how they want to do it i felt
[01:10:13.740 --> 01:10:20.300]  like they had a lot better opportunity with um polis you know or no not polis but the like you
[01:10:20.300 --> 01:10:27.100]  know the wicked witch um the last speaker of the house uh well see yeah of course you know i thought
[01:10:27.100 --> 01:10:31.900]  they had a better opportunity with her so i mean having the house is a big strategic thing that i
[01:10:31.900 --> 01:10:37.420]  know trump wanted so i know that this deception is coming i know that biden is not the same person
[01:10:37.420 --> 01:10:42.460]  that he was i mean you can look at him and see the difference um and then i'd say that's the biggest
[01:10:42.460 --> 01:10:47.980]  next thing for everyone to look at look at what your wallets were like during the trump administration
[01:10:47.980 --> 01:10:53.340]  look at the bank accounts you had look at what you paid for on eggs and then look at all these
[01:10:53.340 --> 01:10:58.220]  little tiny things around you that can show you these deceptions you can google something like
[01:10:58.220 --> 01:11:03.900]  snowboarding and you'll find thousands of articles thousands of pages but when you google alex jones
[01:11:03.900 --> 01:11:09.980]  they've deleted half the internet just look look at your own personal things around you because
[01:11:09.980 --> 01:11:15.100]  when you start realizing all this your cognitive distance kicks in and it's hard to go through
[01:11:15.740 --> 01:11:21.500]  but it's all real absolutely it's incredible if you type in microcarditis covid vaccine
[01:11:22.220 --> 01:11:26.700]  it's all fake results but in the in the documents in the government documents and it's and the
[01:11:26.700 --> 01:11:31.020]  governments are admitting it's killing people but you can't even find the results that's why i
[01:11:31.020 --> 01:11:37.820]  mean i don't even like microsoft and mill gates but being is better duck duck go is great um it's
[01:11:37.820 --> 01:11:42.940]  just crazy all right let's go ahead take another call thank you sir let's talk to erin and origan
[01:11:42.940 --> 01:11:48.860]  you're on the air thanks for holding yeah hey alex hey um you know after watching that mumbling
[01:11:48.860 --> 01:11:54.700]  poogie brain biden last night i mean he didn't even know that schumer was the majority leader
[01:11:54.700 --> 01:12:00.380]  he called him a minority leader and you know i just i voted for trump twice and i think
[01:12:00.380 --> 01:12:05.420]  he was the greatest president but i just don't feel how there's any way they're gonna ever
[01:12:05.420 --> 01:12:10.700]  gonna let him or anybody like that ever take over again after the last couple elections
[01:12:11.420 --> 01:12:17.660]  and i just don't see how this is ever gonna end anything positive you know well you're
[01:12:17.660 --> 01:12:23.260]  absolutely right i mean it's clear the globalists are running america and europe into the ground
[01:12:23.260 --> 01:12:27.820]  shutting us down economically culturally spiritually why are they doing it because they
[01:12:27.820 --> 01:12:33.340]  don't want the rest of the world to aspire to the heights that western civilization took humanity
[01:12:33.340 --> 01:12:36.700]  the globalists are in direct competition with western civilization
[01:12:38.940 --> 01:12:43.500]  yeah and it just you know biden he just couldn't even
[01:12:44.300 --> 01:12:48.700]  comprehend they make it even intelligible of cynics and they're all clapping for him and they
[01:12:48.700 --> 01:12:52.460]  all just look like these lizard creatures you know when they hand out to the audience you
[01:12:52.460 --> 01:12:57.500]  know with these democrats and just i don't know i just don't see a happy indian you know
[01:12:57.500 --> 01:13:01.820]  what this whole situation with we are definitely overrun by evil brother anything else
[01:13:03.580 --> 01:13:09.100]  no i just wanted to point out the you know we're we're in some big trouble i agree with you thanks
[01:13:09.100 --> 01:13:16.460]  for the call let's talk to mike and kansas go ahead thanks for calling hey i'm coming about
[01:13:16.460 --> 01:13:22.460]  how to get rid of uh biden yes sir they use the same same playbook they use with nixon they get
[01:13:22.460 --> 01:13:27.660]  rid of old camel toe hairs whatever the whatever they come up to get rid of her and then he gets
[01:13:27.660 --> 01:13:33.500]  to nominate big mike or nuesome who then gets approved by congress and then they don't have
[01:13:33.500 --> 01:13:37.660]  been in any reason in the world to get rid of biden and there you go exactly i was watching
[01:13:37.660 --> 01:13:43.020]  like a week ago at late at night an old pbs documentary from the 80s about the 70s and
[01:13:43.020 --> 01:13:48.540]  they went after spiro agnew his vice president with an attacks indictment and they got him on
[01:13:49.740 --> 01:13:53.580]  just all the pressure they were putting on them with the watergate plumbers and
[01:13:54.940 --> 01:14:00.780]  then then basically congress then agreed who to put in politically and they put in jaryl ford
[01:14:00.780 --> 01:14:06.620]  so people that say oh it'll be kevin mccarthy in the line of ascension no they can basically all
[01:14:06.620 --> 01:14:11.180]  politically agree on who they want who do you think that person will be if they say blow up an
[01:14:11.180 --> 01:14:19.260]  airplane uh with uh with uh biden on her shooting and then uh indict kamala for corruption who do
[01:14:19.260 --> 01:14:25.020]  you think they want in oh either big mike or nuesome but i think they get rid of her before
[01:14:25.020 --> 01:14:30.140]  they do any of that other stuff no i think you're really a smart cookie i was thinking that a week
[01:14:30.140 --> 01:14:34.380]  ago when i saw that they're gonna they're gonna get rid of the vice president first before they go
[01:14:34.380 --> 01:14:39.420]  after biden right then you know it's coming after that and then how do they get rid of biden
[01:14:39.420 --> 01:14:45.660]  well it doesn't matter at that point they can they can claim you see now anything well they
[01:14:45.660 --> 01:14:51.820]  don't know they claim a white supremacist shoots him shoots him they want to turn him into a victim
[01:14:52.380 --> 01:14:56.060]  and and you can use his murder they're not just going to kill him or assassinate him
[01:14:56.060 --> 01:15:00.700]  they'll do it in some way to blame us i think that's really what's going to happen most likely
[01:15:02.140 --> 01:15:06.860]  anything else sir yeah i want i want my shirt my response you shirt the other day play pool
[01:15:06.860 --> 01:15:14.380]  people say hey alex was right where do i get one i like yeah it's good to have it on well we sold

[01:20:25.660 --> 01:20:34.700]  calling alex yes sir great to be on your show great to have you yes hey before i get started
[01:20:34.700 --> 01:20:38.540]  i just wanted to plug that dna force that stuff is amazing it didn't take enough for a while
[01:20:39.100 --> 01:20:44.700]  and i had myocarditis diagnosed about 20 years ago and i'm telling you that that helps with my
[01:20:44.700 --> 01:20:49.980]  heart with me out really well um the course of ten and there's great but anyways getting back to
[01:20:49.980 --> 01:20:55.500]  the point here about biden i honestly think he's the last person i uh i submitted a video with
[01:20:55.500 --> 01:21:00.620]  your operation paul revere a long time ago when you had that going on and at the end of the video
[01:21:00.620 --> 01:21:05.980]  it ends with biden says get involved in politics unless you want the ccp to take over and that's
[01:21:05.980 --> 01:21:10.540]  really where we're at right now other than that it's a lovely day here in minnesota and
[01:21:10.540 --> 01:21:15.580]  there's not one airplane in the sky what do you think uh the globals are going to pull next
[01:21:17.420 --> 01:21:23.580]  uh i i don't know and that's i think that speech last night by biden was the calm before the storm
[01:21:23.580 --> 01:21:27.180]  i mean if you've just been living in la la land didn't you ever you probably think everything's
[01:21:27.180 --> 01:21:32.220]  great but they've been selling this country off left and right and well that's right they've
[01:21:32.220 --> 01:21:37.660]  already sold it out now they need a big crisis as greg right as greg reset his latest report
[01:21:37.660 --> 01:21:43.740]  that's at vanda video the globalists need a new 9 11 as their reset to get us to submit
[01:21:43.740 --> 01:21:49.260]  to the new castle society the new system they've already got primed and ready yeah i'm i'm real
[01:21:49.260 --> 01:21:53.100]  curious about that too because we got a contract coming up with our union in about two months and
[01:21:53.100 --> 01:21:59.580]  and you know i work for you could say the globalist one of them um but i got it i got to tell you
[01:21:59.580 --> 01:22:04.060]  i you know i don't know i really don't know what's going to go on but everybody just wants a little
[01:22:04.060 --> 01:22:09.020]  bit more pay but half the people here at the plant are awake and that's a good sign for america the
[01:22:09.020 --> 01:22:13.580]  people are awake it's just we got this media in the way that's lying all the time and that's our
[01:22:13.580 --> 01:22:18.220]  biggest so going back years ago what was 10 of the plant awake and now it's 50 percent i mean is
[01:22:18.220 --> 01:22:23.100]  that what you're saying i mean yeah i was the only one who didn't wear a mask uh half the people
[01:22:23.100 --> 01:22:27.500]  wear the mask i'm gonna know is whatever i actually got into a confrontation with the plant manager
[01:22:27.500 --> 01:22:32.780]  i said look this is discrimination i'm not wearing the mask okay i'm outside working you know half
[01:22:32.780 --> 01:22:36.620]  the time i'm in here and you know i wish i was recording this and he ended it right there he
[01:22:36.620 --> 01:22:40.140]  didn't talk with me he didn't harass me anymore about wearing the mask and by the way i've got an
[01:22:40.140 --> 01:22:46.380]  example of that in scotland uh this individual kidnapped and raped a little girl and he was
[01:22:46.380 --> 01:22:50.540]  quote transgender the police said we're not calling transgender we're done he's a man
[01:22:50.540 --> 01:22:55.100]  and that's how the dominoes start to fall when people just say we're done bowing to
[01:22:55.100 --> 01:23:00.220]  political correctness and the whole house of cards comes down thanks to call let's talk to mark in
[01:23:00.220 --> 01:23:06.620]  florida on what's coming next go ahead mark hello my brother first time caller been watching
[01:23:06.620 --> 01:23:12.940]  me since the public access days and supporting you for thank you the last several years welcome
[01:23:12.940 --> 01:23:20.300]  yeah we're facing childhood regulations but unlike most people that i run into that awake
[01:23:20.300 --> 01:23:27.580]  i'm highly optimistic um back in october 2019 i was working in my garage and felt a tap on my
[01:23:27.580 --> 01:23:33.340]  shoulder and immediately thought it was my wife she likes to scratch me i got a good wife and
[01:23:33.340 --> 01:23:41.420]  there was no one there and then i heard a voice uh we need you i'm like okay i'm not not drinking
[01:23:41.420 --> 01:23:47.420]  and i'm not doing anything so for two weeks i'm just like trying to fathom what all this what this
[01:23:47.420 --> 01:23:53.820]  was and there's nothing i mean it didn't make any sense to me and so i finally told my wife
[01:23:54.540 --> 01:23:59.900]  i believe something bad was coming i told her i don't know what it is but something bad is coming
[01:24:00.540 --> 01:24:06.460]  and that for you know just something came over me that i have to get myself over god
[01:24:06.460 --> 01:24:13.900]  and when was this here in the garage working on something october october 2019 and then and then
[01:24:13.900 --> 01:24:21.740]  and then literally you there was a tap and then you heard a voice yeah i mean i never i mean i've
[01:24:21.740 --> 01:24:28.300]  had good vivid dreams you know what kind of like the dreams that you've said before you know my mom
[01:24:28.300 --> 01:24:33.980]  passed away and i knew before she even passed away same thing on my grandmother is that we know
[01:24:33.980 --> 01:24:40.620]  that's real i only heard a voice like that one time and i guess i was in danger because it was like
[01:24:40.620 --> 01:24:45.340]  the holy spirit an angel whatever it was but i was a freshman in high school and i they'd already
[01:24:45.340 --> 01:24:48.220]  put me on the varsity football team and i was not a good football player so i don't know why they
[01:24:48.220 --> 01:24:52.380]  did that i was getting run over i was getting hurt the football season had ended we've been working
[01:24:52.380 --> 01:24:58.540]  out in the field house and then i you know i was going back into the showers and before i went in
[01:24:58.540 --> 01:25:06.540]  to see one of the coaches in the main area it was like a voice went watch out don't go in there and
[01:25:06.540 --> 01:25:14.460]  this guy's cousin had attacked me for no reason people fought a lot back then and i didn't mean
[01:25:14.460 --> 01:25:19.900]  to hit him like that but i punched him and like tore his nose completely off and it was i felt
[01:25:19.900 --> 01:25:24.300]  really bad but i mean so this guy was a varsity football player i walked through the door he
[01:25:24.300 --> 01:25:29.340]  jumps on my back tries to break my neck starts beat me in the head i get him off me start kicking
[01:25:29.340 --> 01:25:34.220]  his ass the coaches come out and stop it but that was the one time where i'm about to walk into there
[01:25:34.220 --> 01:25:39.180]  and it's like i literally heard a voice go don't go in there look out and i just ignored the voice
[01:25:39.180 --> 01:25:43.580]  i was like what the hell is that and i walk in there and get attacked 10 seconds later so
[01:25:43.580 --> 01:25:49.100]  there's definitely some stuff going on this universe brother oh definitely and like i said you
[01:25:49.100 --> 01:25:54.860]  know i told my after two weeks i told my wife you know i'm like hey i'm not crazy you don't
[01:25:54.860 --> 01:26:00.460]  have any kind of uh you know issues or have you i says but something something's coming down the
[01:26:00.460 --> 01:26:06.540]  line i don't know what it is you know and went in a couple months later you know uh through
[01:26:06.540 --> 01:26:12.780]  independent media you know covid we noticed was you know being talked about uh what December
[01:26:12.780 --> 01:26:18.700]  you know december of uh 2019 and she was amazed she was just like mark well how do you know i'm
[01:26:18.700 --> 01:26:23.580]  like i didn't know i just you know it was a premonition someone tapped me on the shoulder i
[01:26:23.580 --> 01:26:30.700]  thought something was falling from the you know the the ceiling of of my garage i know a very well
[01:26:30.700 --> 01:26:38.060]  known rock star who doesn't use drugs very well known clean guy iconic and he was in los angeles
[01:26:38.060 --> 01:26:43.100]  in the 80s when the big quake hit and he did a nighttime gig he was tired it was the middle of
[01:26:43.100 --> 01:26:50.540]  the day whenever that earthquake hit and something said wake up and he woke up and he literally saw
[01:26:50.540 --> 01:26:57.340]  an angel like come through the ceiling it was a face and said get ready and 20 seconds later an
[01:26:57.340 --> 01:27:02.220]  earthquake hit and then those are like the stories people tell you and you don't believe them unless
[01:27:02.220 --> 01:27:08.060]  it it happened to you and so there's a lot going on this universe brother wow what a wild call thank
[01:27:08.060 --> 01:27:15.580]  you mark uh let's go to donna in texas donna thanks for calling hi alex i'm calling you from
[01:27:15.580 --> 01:27:22.060]  angleton texas not far from houston and that's basically my my question you know there's all
[01:27:22.060 --> 01:27:28.620]  this talk about emps and nukes and things like that and being that houston is what the fourth
[01:27:28.620 --> 01:27:34.140]  largest city in the country you know we're we're pretty prepared down here and you know we're
[01:27:34.140 --> 01:27:39.500]  we're trying to do all we can but what do you think is the percentage of the fact that china or
[01:27:39.500 --> 01:27:46.300]  russia would actually spend an emp our way or a nuke i mean we're already at war with russia so
[01:27:46.860 --> 01:27:50.780]  they could attack us any day now the sky's the limit i mean we are in so much danger i can't even
[01:27:51.340 --> 01:27:58.620]  i mean i anything goes now that's all i can say well and in terms of you know being prepared you
[01:27:58.620 --> 01:28:05.180]  can't be prepared for anything like that we've never gone through anything like that and in talking
[01:28:05.180 --> 01:28:11.820]  about russia and china i i start to think about you know if they nuke us or you know even the emp
[01:28:12.460 --> 01:28:18.460]  what does that benefit them because if they ruin all our infrastructure how are they going to come
[01:28:18.460 --> 01:28:23.820]  in here and just take over but you know they would have to they would have to fix everything and then
[01:28:23.820 --> 01:28:30.140]  they have to deal with us and you know what what's your take on that well that's the thing about a
[01:28:30.140 --> 01:28:34.300]  war is people commit to it they decided to destroy each other and they'll think well we'll be in
[01:28:34.300 --> 01:28:38.620]  charge after we'll figure it out then and so i think you just answered your own question it's
[01:28:38.620 --> 01:28:44.300]  insane and even if you emp shield the faraday cage is what you've got the power goes out many

[01:31:28.700 --> 01:31:33.260]  important the spike protein is loaded in the body with the COVID-19 infection and definitely with
[01:31:33.260 --> 01:31:37.580]  the vaccines people are lower with the spike protein they don't feel well this is a potential

[01:33:47.980 --> 01:33:54.300]  and we're taking your phone calls i'm going to get to deos ex and this important elan muster
[01:33:54.300 --> 01:33:57.980]  his next segment that continue all your calls into the third hour but we're taking a lot of
[01:33:57.980 --> 01:34:01.580]  calls we're doing a pretty good job i think david california is an airline pilot on the
[01:34:01.580 --> 01:34:08.060]  vaccinations and other pilots i ran into a couple of pilots that were listeners telling me all the
[01:34:08.060 --> 01:34:12.300]  problems with the shots when i was at the austin airport a few weeks ago what are you seeing david
[01:34:13.900 --> 01:34:18.220]  hey elix good to talk to you thank you so much for having me on yes calling from southern california
[01:34:18.220 --> 01:34:23.980]  deep behind enemy lines here um you know my i'm an airline pilot my wife's an airline pilot i've
[01:34:23.980 --> 01:34:28.140]  been looking to you for a long time so when it came out about the shots that you know as pilots
[01:34:28.140 --> 01:34:33.260]  we've all been taught to use critical thinking so it's kind of a no-brainer not to take the shots
[01:34:33.260 --> 01:34:37.820]  but um you know with the airline that we both fly for uh we're actually both fly for different
[01:34:37.820 --> 01:34:42.140]  airlines but uh you know we can definitely say that uh the good majority of pilots that didn't
[01:34:42.140 --> 01:34:46.060]  take the shot so it was kind of kind of funny listening to that you're reading emails from
[01:34:46.060 --> 01:34:49.740]  our own company saying like oh you better get the shot because they are the big calling vaccines
[01:34:49.740 --> 01:34:55.260]  because and aren't you vindicated now they're having to back off oh completely yeah no i mean
[01:34:55.260 --> 01:34:59.100]  no regrets right obviously and it's funny every pilot i talked to there's not a single pilot that's
[01:34:59.100 --> 01:35:03.340]  like oh yeah i never took the shot but joe bind's a good guy and the world world economic form
[01:35:03.340 --> 01:35:06.380]  they're good people they should be in charge you know every pilot i've talked to you that hasn't
[01:35:06.380 --> 01:35:11.660]  taken the shots we all know what's going on all of them are awake so i'm so glad i didn't take the
[01:35:11.660 --> 01:35:15.980]  shot now i do know a couple other pilots that did take the shot one individual who's in his mid-20s
[01:35:15.980 --> 01:35:23.100]  he was applying for uh the uh what i'm gonna say with the navy or something anyway good uh healthy
[01:35:23.100 --> 01:35:28.940]  kid he played basketball or walk basketball water polo he obviously had to get the shots just to be
[01:35:28.940 --> 01:35:33.820]  able to try and get the job flying for the military and ended up with a heart problem and they basically
[01:35:33.820 --> 01:35:38.140]  screwed him and now he's he's trying to get his f a medical back and he's having a really hard
[01:35:38.140 --> 01:35:42.780]  well so so again how do you attack america and the west without them knowing you do it through
[01:35:43.340 --> 01:35:47.420]  a so-called medical system where you know the medical system will want to cover it up even
[01:35:47.420 --> 01:35:51.020]  though they weren't conscious of it on average they'll want to cover it up just through cell
[01:35:51.020 --> 01:35:55.500]  preservation and by that act they then fully corrupt the medical system and can prepare an
[01:35:55.500 --> 01:36:01.900]  even bigger lie absolutely and i really want to take this moment to thank you so much my wife and
[01:36:01.900 --> 01:36:07.340]  i thank you so much for the information you put out you know years ago because i you know i i'm
[01:36:07.340 --> 01:36:11.500]  my wife's way smarter than i am i probably would have fallen for it if i hadn't been so you know
[01:36:11.500 --> 01:36:16.780]  paying attention to what was going on so you know and as a big thank you know we've purchased uh x2
[01:36:16.780 --> 01:36:21.500]  dna force um you know turbo force is great you know especially for a pilot flying red eyes all the
[01:36:21.500 --> 01:36:25.500]  times stay up all night that's awesome and then down and out to use that at the end of a trip
[01:36:25.500 --> 01:36:29.260]  to go to sleep in the middle of the day which i hate that they make us do that anyway so taking
[01:36:29.260 --> 01:36:33.580]  down and out that works i've got multiple t-shirts all the coins i bought three of each i've got your
[01:36:33.580 --> 01:36:38.460]  book three of those got one of them signed brother you're the reason we're still on air it's the

[01:36:59.980 --> 01:37:05.580]  28 years in this rotten state of new york what they have done you can google this on any search
[01:37:05.580 --> 01:37:13.100]  engine they've created governing boards with starting salaries of 350 000 to infiltrate our
[01:37:13.100 --> 01:37:18.460]  meetings and what they're doing they're sending in their operatives to get these people off the
[01:37:18.460 --> 01:37:23.180]  streets and out of rehabs and send them to methadone clinics to get them on suboxone tell them they
[01:37:23.180 --> 01:37:28.140]  don't need a a they're rewriting our literature oh i know they're going after every independent
[01:37:28.140 --> 01:37:32.620]  good group they're they're trying to take over the salvation army a all the good groups i've
[01:37:32.620 --> 01:37:38.300]  i know about that and what they're doing is their main objective they want to take god out of our
[01:37:38.300 --> 01:37:43.260]  literature and that is the main purpose oh you see the church of england's getting rid of god entirely
[01:37:43.260 --> 01:37:49.900]  exactly wow and the last thing i'd like to say alex there's a meeting in lake george new york
[01:37:49.900 --> 01:37:55.340]  tonight at seven o'clock it's a gsr meeting if any of your listeners are active members of a a
[01:37:55.340 --> 01:38:00.700]  you need to go to this meeting with a bullhorn and give them all the shit you can because they
[01:38:00.700 --> 01:38:05.420]  are destroying the most vulnerable people who are trying to get off their feet and get their lives
[01:38:05.420 --> 01:38:09.980]  together exactly but talk about this more they don't want people to find god which all the
[01:38:09.980 --> 01:38:13.260]  statistics where they don't believe in god or not is the best way to get people off drugs and
[01:38:13.260 --> 01:38:18.060]  alcohol because i know folks who are in a a i'm not perfect i got my own issues only god get you
[01:38:18.060 --> 01:38:24.060]  out of this and they're trying to remove that so describe what's happening with with government
[01:38:24.060 --> 01:38:30.300]  sponsored infiltration to take over some of the best organizations what they're doing is is they're
[01:38:30.300 --> 01:38:34.940]  they're they're sending in people they've changed the literature now so if you if you google any
[01:38:34.940 --> 01:38:40.940]  meeting to go to it used to be certain meetings were closed just to alcoholics now they've changed
[01:38:40.940 --> 01:38:45.420]  the wording to all people are welcome to a a whether you're an alcoholic or not and that's
[01:38:45.420 --> 01:38:51.900]  okay but the people that they're sending in are literally agents of the new world order and if
[01:38:51.900 --> 01:38:56.940]  this doesn't stop a a will be done and that's their main job to do well that's that they want

[01:39:41.660 --> 01:39:47.180]  let's go to tony in new hampshire go ahead hey alex can you hear me i can't thank you
[01:39:48.460 --> 01:39:53.500]  hey alex thank you so much for everything um just want to say i'm up here in new hampshire
[01:39:53.500 --> 01:39:59.980]  it's crazy town here i actually just moved to new hampshire to get out of massachusetts um because
[01:39:59.980 --> 01:40:06.860]  everybody's nuts so i'm new to you i listen to you every day and i hear you talk about all right
[01:40:06.860 --> 01:40:15.180]  people get ready prepare but aside from you know the obvious talking up on food water medicine
[01:40:15.180 --> 01:40:21.420]  what else can i do lately i keep thinking okay do i just take all my money out of the bank then
[01:40:21.420 --> 01:40:27.340]  what do i keep it at my house do i buy gold what do i do and i know there's a lot of things that
[01:40:27.340 --> 01:40:32.620]  can happen whether it be with the globalist or cyber attack or i would tell you this i would i
[01:40:32.620 --> 01:40:38.780]  would hedge your bets and i would spread things out and i would find like-minded people that know
[01:40:38.780 --> 01:40:43.580]  what's going on because this is a biblical assault on society on civilization and humanity
[01:40:44.140 --> 01:40:49.260]  and i don't have the answers to i sit there with my wife and my family we all know what's going down
[01:40:49.260 --> 01:40:54.460]  and we're just like what do we do do we just stay here in a major city keep fighting which we decided
[01:40:54.460 --> 01:40:59.340]  to do because of the work we're doing but if people aren't doing this work i would i wouldn't
[01:40:59.340 --> 01:41:02.860]  just haphazardly run to the countryside but if there's some like-minded people that know what's
[01:41:02.860 --> 01:41:08.300]  going on money and power doesn't matter what matters is security and people you can trust
[01:41:08.300 --> 01:41:14.220]  and being out of the system and away from 5g away from the gmo and and and just and just really
[01:41:14.220 --> 01:41:19.180]  realizing the system is being taken over by a predatory group that wants full control of the
[01:41:19.180 --> 01:41:26.220]  civilization okay all right well thank you so much keep doing what you do thank you well i'm
[01:41:26.220 --> 01:41:31.500]  trying but but what are you seeing in new hampshire you're seeing massachusetts was crazy town and just
[01:41:31.500 --> 01:41:37.580]  everybody's under the new world order but well is it good or bad in new hampshire um new hampshire
[01:41:37.580 --> 01:41:44.140]  is just slightly better than massachusetts but in massachusetts i still work there um everybody

[01:43:40.460 --> 01:43:45.660]  us on air you are literally nonviolently politically punching the new world order in the nose
[01:43:45.660 --> 01:43:50.940]  punching their lives in the nose we are going to defeat the new world order we're going over the top
[01:43:50.940 --> 01:43:55.900]  but right now is the critical juncture so please go to infowar store dot com and donate now donate
[01:43:55.900 --> 01:44:04.620]  now donate now donate now and cumba commander here with an important message to humanity
[01:44:05.260 --> 01:44:13.180]  i have decided that all of you will take a special injection so that you will be safe
[01:44:13.180 --> 01:44:23.340]  but the injection is not ready yet and so i need all of you to stay indoors for the next 15 days
[01:44:23.340 --> 01:44:33.340]  To flatten the cans, I also need you to wear masks, and I also need you to only shop at mega corporations.
[01:44:33.340 --> 01:44:39.340]  That way we can consolidate control and bankrupt the world economy.
[01:44:39.340 --> 01:44:43.340]  Leaving companies that only I own profitable.
[01:44:43.340 --> 01:44:46.340]  You will then be my slaves.
[01:44:46.340 --> 01:44:58.340]  And then you'll get that special shot of freedom from KELPRA will remove your immune system, so you'll be depended on me for the rest of your miserable lives.
[01:44:58.340 --> 01:45:04.340]  Everybody that's watching this needs to support Alex Jones, needs to support Infowars and banned.video.
[01:45:04.340 --> 01:45:08.340]  You know, the Bible says let another mouth praise you. I'm gonna do that right now.
[01:45:08.340 --> 01:45:17.340]  Alex Jones has helped so many people in this industry. You guys have no idea how many people have got their first start like Savannah Hernandez.
[01:45:17.340 --> 01:45:23.340]  How many people have just been put on a launch pad to outer space because of Alex Jones, including myself.
[01:45:23.340 --> 01:45:32.340]  I've been given so many opportunities because of this man and because of this platform, and I would probably not even be half of where I am right now if it weren't for Alex Jones.
[01:45:32.340 --> 01:45:38.340]  I mean, I've been able to be on podcasts with Alex and Joe Rogan and Tim Cass, the super Tim Cass IRL.
[01:45:38.340 --> 01:45:46.340]  Listen, what I'm saying is do not take Alex Jones and banned.video for granted because you don't know what you have until it's gone.
[01:45:46.340 --> 01:45:54.340]  We need to support free speech systems right now, so go check out the store, go support their store, go support Infowars, leave a donation right now.
[01:45:54.340 --> 01:45:56.340]  Don't wait until they're gone.
[01:45:56.340 --> 01:46:12.340]  In the year 2000, Alex Jones' film Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove showed the world how our so-called elite leaders practice mock ritual sacrifices in private.
[01:46:12.340 --> 01:46:27.340]  In 2007, Alex Jones releases Endgame, exposing the world elite's plans for covertly using biological weapons against all of mankind.
[01:46:27.340 --> 01:46:35.340]  And by the time they launched their attack in 2020, Alex Jones' Infowars and our audience were there to warn the people of the deadly vaccines that we knew were coming.
[01:46:35.340 --> 01:46:44.340]  This is why they attack us. This is why we need your support because we tell the truth. Alex Jones was right.
[01:46:44.340 --> 01:47:08.340]  Join the resistance. Buy products. Donate to the cause. Share the links. Join us in the fight for freedom and help us defeat the New World Order.
[01:47:14.340 --> 01:47:24.340]  As I said earlier, anybody that thinks you're living in a boring world is crazy.
[01:47:24.340 --> 01:47:30.340]  We're living in the most critical time in human existence right now.
[01:47:30.340 --> 01:47:38.340]  And yes, there are forces of evil in the universe. There's also all-powerful force of good. We've got to dial into it.
[01:47:38.340 --> 01:47:45.340]  Taking your phone calls coming up next hour for everybody that's patiently holding that's only about 12 minutes away.
[01:47:45.340 --> 01:47:52.340]  I want to go ahead and hit this report that's on Infowars.com. It's not supposed to be real.
[01:47:52.340 --> 01:48:00.340]  Elon Musk highlights a 20-year-old video game that predicted a globalist takeover.
[01:48:00.340 --> 01:48:14.340]  Day 6. Day of Sex. And he goes through how the game predicted that governments would release a bio weapon for political control.
[01:48:14.340 --> 01:48:19.340]  He goes on to say the game titled Day of Sex was released in the summer of 2000.
[01:48:19.340 --> 01:48:32.340]  The time seemed to be like pure science fiction, but now it looks disturbingly prophetic. It's not supposed to be real. Tweeted Elon Musk Monday with the game box art.
[01:48:32.340 --> 01:48:42.340]  We don't want to talk more about it. The game takes place in the year 2052. Full articles on Infowars.com.
[01:48:42.340 --> 01:48:48.340]  The cover of the game almost looks like Elon Musk looking up into the sky.
[01:48:48.340 --> 01:48:54.340]  But when I saw this, I went, well, wait a minute. I talked to the creators of it. They were going to make a new version.
[01:48:54.340 --> 01:48:59.340]  They wanted me to be in it. And for some reason, that never happened. You've got humans merged with cyborgs.
[01:48:59.340 --> 01:49:07.340]  You've got this whole future system. You've got FEMA camps. You've got forced injections. You've got everything in it.
[01:49:07.340 --> 01:49:16.340]  And of course, Infowars, when I was covering, was one of the main episcizes for the hit game that was Underground Game.
[01:49:16.340 --> 01:49:26.340]  And I just noticed that Elon Musk is out there, bringing this up like it's so prophetic, but he knows, meanwhile, it's based, because you type in Alex Jones, Deus Ex.
[01:49:26.340 --> 01:49:31.340]  It's everywhere. You have the creators talking about me being a big influence. You have it all going on.
[01:49:31.340 --> 01:49:39.340]  But then still, the person that warned about all this is Prasada Nangrata on Twitter. And I'm not lobbying to get back on Twitter.
[01:49:39.340 --> 01:49:47.340]  The point is, is that why is Musk doing this? Why is he endorsing a game that exposed it, but not the films and documentaries I made that went through it?
[01:49:47.340 --> 01:50:10.340]  So here's some of the pop art made around myself in Deus Ex, Deus Ex, and then some of the clips from the actual game.
[01:50:18.340 --> 01:50:24.340]  But we never touch anything directly. We only influence, suggest, insinuate.
[01:50:24.340 --> 01:50:32.340]  The entire executive branch is handpicked. 19 of the last 23 US presidents have been members of the Trilateral Commission.
[01:50:32.340 --> 01:50:36.340]  The Trilateral Commission is financed by the Rockefellers and the Rothschilds.
[01:50:36.340 --> 01:50:48.340]  Let's get back to what we know about Prague and what we always know when it comes to false flag situations, like Gulf of Tomkin and the Reichstag, like 9-11 and the Aug incident before this.
[01:50:48.340 --> 01:50:50.340]  There's more here than meets the eye.
[01:50:50.340 --> 01:50:55.340]  Ask me. I think the government did it. They want people to think the NSF are terrorists.
[01:50:55.340 --> 01:50:59.340]  I think the government made the plague on purpose to get rid of the population growth.
[01:50:59.340 --> 01:51:07.340]  People know the government has a vaccine. Riots everywhere. The same corporation that makes Ambrosia also manufactures the virus.
[01:51:07.340 --> 01:51:10.340]  Quite convenient. They're infecting people on purpose, huh?
[01:51:10.340 --> 01:51:16.340]  Executive Order 1099 or 0. It lets us take over all modes of transportation.
[01:51:16.340 --> 01:51:17.340]  FEMA can do that?
[01:51:17.340 --> 01:51:23.340]  If the president declares an emergency, Executive Order 1099 or 5, we can take over the media.
[01:51:23.340 --> 01:51:24.340]  All of it?
[01:51:24.340 --> 01:51:25.340]  Any and all.
[01:51:25.340 --> 01:51:35.340]  Need I remind you that in the case of a national emergency, FEMA has a list of 6 million Americans who will be transported to detention centers?
[01:51:35.340 --> 01:51:39.340]  Your tabloids call it RX-84.
[01:51:39.340 --> 01:51:43.340]  Yeah, including the president, Congress and the Supreme Court.
[01:51:43.340 --> 01:51:49.340]  In my position, I find it very easy to add names to that list.
[01:51:49.340 --> 01:51:55.340]  The whole project of world government, going back to the League of Nations, has been funded and manipulated mainly by wealthy bankers.
[01:51:55.340 --> 01:51:59.340]  Remember that the UN itself was built on land donated by John D. Rockefeller.
[01:51:59.340 --> 01:52:06.340]  They will never stop until we are all dropped into isolationist ghettos, just like Gollum City followers.
[01:52:06.340 --> 01:52:12.340]  This attack expedites legislation that in time will be expanded to include naturals.
[01:52:12.340 --> 01:52:19.340]  It will guarantee legislation that will make the distribution and implantation of chips mandatory.
[01:52:19.340 --> 01:52:23.340]  Chips that will eventually be implanted in our natural asses too.
[01:52:23.340 --> 01:52:27.340]  I told you an attack like this was imminent and people called me paranoid.
[01:52:27.340 --> 01:52:32.340]  Well, what do you think now at conspiracy underscore Chad 99?
[01:52:32.340 --> 01:52:34.340]  The world must know by now, Everett.
[01:52:34.340 --> 01:52:36.340]  What we've done, know what?
[01:52:36.340 --> 01:52:39.340]  Only that the long night is over.
[01:52:39.340 --> 01:52:41.340]  The crown of government is tarnished.
[01:52:41.340 --> 01:52:43.340]  But that will fade in time.
[01:52:43.340 --> 01:52:46.340]  The wealthy have always been the ones to profit from one world government.
[01:52:46.340 --> 01:52:48.340]  The United Nations secret goal.
[01:52:48.340 --> 01:52:52.340]  Well, this is David Rockefeller's description from a half a century ago.
[01:52:52.340 --> 01:52:56.340]  The super national sovereignty of an intellectual elite and world bankers.
[01:52:56.340 --> 01:53:00.340]  If you want to post to your followers, are we protecting ourselves from them?
[01:53:00.340 --> 01:53:03.340]  Or are they protecting themselves from us?
[01:53:03.340 --> 01:53:06.340]  God admit, I'm conflicted.
[01:53:06.340 --> 01:53:11.340]  Executive order 10997, we can take a man of natural resources.
[01:53:11.340 --> 01:53:15.340]  Some people just don't understand the dangers of indiscriminate surveillance.
[01:53:15.340 --> 01:53:19.340]  You know, they've tried to take our guns away from us for so many years.
[01:53:19.340 --> 01:53:22.340]  And that's one of the good things about this whole log hysteria.
[01:53:22.340 --> 01:53:24.340]  It's a dive fry.
[01:53:24.340 --> 01:53:30.340]  Leftist political groups that blamed guns for all the mass murders in the early 2000s can bug off now.
[01:53:30.340 --> 01:53:32.340]  You haven't heard of RX-84?
[01:53:32.340 --> 01:53:33.340]  Uh-huh.
[01:53:33.340 --> 01:53:37.340]  FEMA takes over the highways, police, airports, media, the armed forces.
[01:53:37.340 --> 01:53:39.340]  But they still report to the president, right?
[01:53:39.340 --> 01:54:03.340]  Not until the end of the emergency.
[01:54:03.340 --> 01:54:07.340]  Who are we? Who are we really?
[01:54:07.340 --> 01:54:09.340]  We are the invisible hand.
[01:54:09.340 --> 01:54:11.340]  We are the Illuminati.
[01:54:11.340 --> 01:54:13.340]  We come before and after.
[01:54:13.340 --> 01:54:15.340]  We are forever.
[01:54:15.340 --> 01:54:21.340]  And eventually, eventually, we will leave them to the day.
[01:54:21.340 --> 01:54:23.340]  I've done what you asked.
[01:54:23.340 --> 01:54:24.340]  Now what?
[01:54:24.340 --> 01:54:28.340]  I want freedom and space exploration and the next Renaissance.
[01:54:28.340 --> 01:54:31.340]  And I don't care nobody knows by name of the future.
[01:54:31.340 --> 01:54:33.340]  Who are you?
[01:54:33.340 --> 01:54:34.340]  I'm a pioneer.
[01:54:34.340 --> 01:54:35.340]  I'm a explorer.
[01:54:35.340 --> 01:54:37.340]  I'm a human being and I'm children.
[01:54:37.340 --> 01:54:38.340]  I'm a human being.
[01:54:38.340 --> 01:54:39.340]  I'm a warrior.
[01:54:39.340 --> 01:54:41.340]  I've got the fire of human living.
[01:54:41.340 --> 01:54:43.340]  I've shot the fires everywhere.
[01:54:43.340 --> 01:54:45.340]  The humans are turning on everywhere.
[01:54:45.340 --> 01:54:48.340]  And if I do, what becomes of me?
[01:54:48.340 --> 01:54:50.340]  I'm the originator of this war forever.
[01:54:50.340 --> 01:54:51.340]  All of us together.
[01:54:51.340 --> 01:54:53.340]  I'm the race color queen.
[01:54:53.340 --> 01:54:54.340]  There's one humanity.
[01:54:54.340 --> 01:54:55.340]  I believe in them.
[01:54:55.340 --> 01:54:56.340]  I'm a savior.
[01:54:56.340 --> 01:54:58.340]  I want to win.
[01:54:58.340 --> 01:55:01.340]  This is what I was made for, isn't it?
[01:55:01.340 --> 01:55:05.340]  It is my duty to carry on forever.
[01:55:05.340 --> 01:55:06.340]  That's living forever.
[01:55:06.340 --> 01:55:07.340]  That's victory.
[01:55:07.340 --> 01:55:08.340]  I want prosperity.
[01:55:08.340 --> 01:55:11.340]  And I want to smash the skulls of bullies and murderers
[01:55:11.340 --> 01:55:14.340]  and child molesters wide open.
[01:55:18.340 --> 01:55:21.340]  Well, the point is people are awake
[01:55:21.340 --> 01:55:24.340]  and the new older is not going to be able to stop that
[01:55:24.340 --> 01:55:27.340]  unless they kill everybody.
[01:55:27.340 --> 01:55:29.340]  And imagine the fools that have signed onto this system
[01:55:29.340 --> 01:55:31.340]  that are still defending it,
[01:55:31.340 --> 01:55:34.340]  even if it destroys their very future.
[01:55:34.340 --> 01:55:37.340]  I'm going to start the third hour here in a moment.
[01:55:37.340 --> 01:55:39.340]  And we're going to go to the calls,
[01:55:39.340 --> 01:55:42.340]  the order that they are received.
[01:55:42.340 --> 01:55:45.340]  So get ready and start your engines.
[01:55:45.340 --> 01:55:48.340]  In fact, let's just go to the calls now.
[01:55:48.340 --> 01:55:51.340]  Dave and Pennsylvania, you're on the air.
[01:55:51.340 --> 01:55:53.340]  Yes, Alex, can you hear me?
[01:55:53.340 --> 01:55:54.340]  Yes, sir, go ahead.
[01:55:54.340 --> 01:55:55.340]  All right.
[01:55:55.340 --> 01:55:56.340]  We've got the bone broth.
[01:55:56.340 --> 01:55:59.340]  Just arrived at my door.
[01:55:59.340 --> 01:56:02.340]  See, I made one of the biggest mistakes I ever made,
[01:56:02.340 --> 01:56:04.340]  May of 21.
[01:56:04.340 --> 01:56:06.340]  I actually took the vaccine.
[01:56:06.340 --> 01:56:09.340]  I put one shot of the Johnson.
[01:56:09.340 --> 01:56:12.340]  And with not instantly, but within that year,
[01:56:12.340 --> 01:56:17.340]  I had four blood clots in my right calf.
[01:56:17.340 --> 01:56:20.340]  Fast forward, I got the blood results.
[01:56:20.340 --> 01:56:24.340]  The doctors said, oh, you have a genetic mutation
[01:56:24.340 --> 01:56:26.340]  that one in 50 people have
[01:56:26.340 --> 01:56:29.340]  that make you more likely to get a blood clot
[01:56:29.340 --> 01:56:31.340]  than someone else.
[01:56:31.340 --> 01:56:33.340]  So number one, if one in 50 people
[01:56:33.340 --> 01:56:35.340]  have some kind of mutation,
[01:56:35.340 --> 01:56:37.340]  making them more likely to get a blood clot,
[01:56:37.340 --> 01:56:39.340]  why would you give them a vaccine
[01:56:39.340 --> 01:56:41.340]  that would be more susceptible to...
[01:56:41.340 --> 01:56:43.340]  And of course they just make that up.
[01:56:43.340 --> 01:56:45.340]  Oh, it wasn't a shot, did it?
[01:56:45.340 --> 01:56:46.340]  Everything's fine.
[01:56:46.340 --> 01:56:47.340]  Right, exactly.
[01:56:47.340 --> 01:56:48.340]  So fast forward.
[01:56:48.340 --> 01:56:50.340]  Yeah, I'm on the low dose blood center.
[01:56:50.340 --> 01:56:52.340]  But ever since that,
[01:56:52.340 --> 01:56:55.340]  I didn't know about info wars at the time.
[01:56:55.340 --> 01:56:57.340]  I know about you guys now.
[01:56:57.340 --> 01:57:01.340]  And I'm in the better health than I've ever been
[01:57:01.340 --> 01:57:05.340]  because now that I'm awake to the vaccine stuff,
[01:57:05.340 --> 01:57:08.340]  when Trump said it was okay, I'm thinking whatever.
[01:57:08.340 --> 01:57:10.340]  I was in the military for four years.
[01:57:10.340 --> 01:57:12.340]  God knows what they injected me with.
[01:57:12.340 --> 01:57:14.340]  I'm thinking, let me get this stupid card
[01:57:14.340 --> 01:57:17.340]  so I can travel and do whatever I need to do.
[01:57:17.340 --> 01:57:19.340]  And I got this card, the thing's not gonna...
[01:57:19.340 --> 01:57:20.340]  Hold on, don't hang up.
[01:57:20.340 --> 01:57:22.340]  Dave, I'm gonna go to break for two minutes,
[01:57:22.340 --> 01:57:23.340]  come right back to you.
[01:57:23.340 --> 01:57:24.340]  I want you to tell your whole story here.
[01:57:24.340 --> 01:57:26.340]  And then we'll go to everybody else
[01:57:26.340 --> 01:57:27.340]  that you ordered and received.
[01:57:27.340 --> 01:57:30.340]  Richard, Justin, Carlos, Vincent, Alan, Dennis,
[01:57:30.340 --> 01:57:32.340]  Rob, Peter, your calls are straight ahead.
[01:57:32.340 --> 01:57:34.340]  Hour number three.
[01:57:34.340 --> 01:57:36.340]  And again, we have 14 minutes and ads an hour
[01:57:36.340 --> 01:57:38.340]  on like other podcasts,
[01:57:38.340 --> 01:57:40.340]  because we're still on a bunch of radio stations.
[01:57:40.340 --> 01:57:43.340]  But I've started a new commercial free podcast
[01:57:43.340 --> 01:57:50.340]  called AlexJonesLive.com.
[01:57:50.340 --> 01:57:52.340]  I talk a lot about the great successes
[01:57:52.340 --> 01:57:53.340]  InfoWars has had.
[01:57:53.340 --> 01:57:55.340]  I don't think anybody can deny it.
[01:57:55.340 --> 01:57:59.340]  And it is because of listeners and viewers supporting us.
[01:57:59.340 --> 01:58:01.340]  But when we talk about the crew at InfoWars,
[01:58:01.340 --> 01:58:04.340]  people behind the scenes, the researchers, the writers,
[01:58:04.340 --> 01:58:08.340]  they really have been the MVPs in this fight.
[01:58:08.340 --> 01:58:10.340]  And we look at Harrison Smith and Owen Schreuer
[01:58:10.340 --> 01:58:12.340]  and the hard work they engage in every day.
[01:58:12.340 --> 01:58:14.340]  Five, six, seven days a week.
[01:58:14.340 --> 01:58:16.340]  It's really just incredible.
[01:58:16.340 --> 01:58:18.340]  So for myself, the whole InfoWars crew,
[01:58:18.340 --> 01:58:20.340]  I thank you for your past support.
[01:58:20.340 --> 01:58:22.340]  I only encourage you now to realize
[01:58:22.340 --> 01:58:26.340]  that InfoWars cannot stay on air if you do not support us.
[01:58:26.340 --> 01:58:27.340]  I know you spread the word.
[01:58:27.340 --> 01:58:28.340]  I know you pray for us.
[01:58:28.340 --> 01:58:29.340]  And that's wonderful. Keep doing it.
[01:58:29.340 --> 01:58:31.340]  But most viewers and listeners
[01:58:31.340 --> 01:58:33.340]  never go to InfoWarsTour.com
[01:58:33.340 --> 01:58:36.340]  and you never buy great products that enrich and empower your life.
[01:58:36.340 --> 01:58:38.340]  All at the same time, keep us on air.
[01:58:38.340 --> 01:58:40.340]  I know that less than 1% of our listeners
[01:58:40.340 --> 01:58:42.340]  actually go buy products at InfoWarsTour.com.
[01:58:42.340 --> 01:58:46.340]  If just 1% more of you took action and went to InfoWarsTour.com,
[01:58:46.340 --> 01:58:47.340]  our funding problems will be over.
[01:58:47.340 --> 01:58:48.340]  Please take action now.
[01:58:48.340 --> 01:58:50.340]  I have an extremely important message
[01:58:50.340 --> 01:58:52.340]  to all of my fellow InfoWars
[01:58:52.340 --> 01:58:55.340]  here in the United States and around the world.
[01:58:55.340 --> 01:58:59.340]  We are so excited to announce InfoWars MD.
[01:58:59.340 --> 01:59:02.340]  It turns out the top company in the U.S.
[01:59:02.340 --> 01:59:04.340]  for supplements is owned by a patriot.
[01:59:04.340 --> 01:59:06.340]  And it turns out they're willing to give us deals
[01:59:06.340 --> 01:59:10.340]  that no one else is getting because they want to support InfoWars
[01:59:10.340 --> 01:59:11.340]  and keep us on the air.
[01:59:11.340 --> 01:59:13.340]  This deal has been a year in the making
[01:59:13.340 --> 01:59:15.340]  and finally the products are being brought to market.
[01:59:15.340 --> 01:59:19.340]  Up to 50% off what you get on top national brands
[01:59:19.340 --> 01:59:22.340]  of the highest rated under the InfoWars label,
[01:59:22.340 --> 01:59:26.340]  InfoWars MD, exclusively at InfoWarsTour.com.
[01:59:26.340 --> 01:59:31.340]  Check out the first of 10 new products at InfoWarsTour.com,
[01:59:31.340 --> 01:59:33.340]  whether it's turmeric or whether it's joint care,
[01:59:33.340 --> 01:59:37.340]  or whether it is super greens, we have them all
[01:59:37.340 --> 01:59:43.340]  at InfoWarsTour.com under the banner of InfoWars MD.
[01:59:43.340 --> 01:59:45.340]  This is the best deal out there
[01:59:45.340 --> 01:59:47.340]  and it keeps InfoWars on the air.
[01:59:47.340 --> 02:00:14.340]  InfoWars MD.
[02:00:14.340 --> 02:00:18.340]  That's because you're asking the wrong people.
[02:00:18.340 --> 02:00:20.340]  Dave at Pizzle Danger, start your story over
[02:00:20.340 --> 02:00:22.340]  and describe you took the Johnson & Johnson
[02:00:22.340 --> 02:00:24.340]  which they now admit is linked to blood clots.
[02:00:24.340 --> 02:00:25.340]  They do it the whole time.
[02:00:25.340 --> 02:00:26.340]  And then what happened to you?
[02:00:26.340 --> 02:00:27.340]  Please continue.
[02:00:27.340 --> 02:00:28.340]  Right.
[02:00:28.340 --> 02:00:30.340]  I had no idea that the shots were dangerous.
[02:00:30.340 --> 02:00:32.340]  I didn't know about InfoWars at the time.
[02:00:32.340 --> 02:00:33.340]  I got the shot.
[02:00:33.340 --> 02:00:36.340]  And within, not instantly, but within that year,
[02:00:36.340 --> 02:00:39.340]  I had a soreness in my right calf.
[02:00:39.340 --> 02:00:40.340]  Just a regular soreness.
[02:00:40.340 --> 02:00:42.340]  I'm thinking maybe it's from running,
[02:00:42.340 --> 02:00:45.340]  maybe it's going too hard in the gym or whatever.
[02:00:45.340 --> 02:00:48.340]  But because then I started listening to InfoWars
[02:00:48.340 --> 02:00:50.340]  and I said, I'm getting this checked out
[02:00:50.340 --> 02:00:51.340]  to make sure it's nothing serious
[02:00:51.340 --> 02:00:53.340]  because I got this stupid shot.
[02:00:53.340 --> 02:00:56.340]  So sure enough, I go to the ER.
[02:00:56.340 --> 02:00:57.340]  They do an ultrasound.
[02:00:57.340 --> 02:01:00.340]  They told me I had four blood clots in my right calf.
[02:01:00.340 --> 02:01:02.340]  I'm a healthy guy.
[02:01:02.340 --> 02:01:03.340]  I exercised.
[02:01:03.340 --> 02:01:05.340]  I was in the Marines for four years.
[02:01:05.340 --> 02:01:07.340]  There's no, there's no explanation
[02:01:07.340 --> 02:01:09.340]  of why I would have gotten the clot.
[02:01:09.340 --> 02:01:12.340]  So fast forward with blessing in the skies.
[02:01:12.340 --> 02:01:14.340]  Now that I know it's there,
[02:01:14.340 --> 02:01:16.340]  I look at it as a battle wound.
[02:01:16.340 --> 02:01:19.340]  Because right now we're in that war of information
[02:01:19.340 --> 02:01:21.340]  where they're lying to us constantly.
[02:01:21.340 --> 02:01:23.340]  They took a shot at me.
[02:01:23.340 --> 02:01:24.340]  Yeah, I got hit.
[02:01:24.340 --> 02:01:25.340]  But guess what?
[02:01:25.340 --> 02:01:27.340]  Now I'm fired up even more
[02:01:27.340 --> 02:01:30.340]  because luckily it didn't take me down.
[02:01:30.340 --> 02:01:31.340]  Beautiful.
[02:01:31.340 --> 02:01:32.340]  Keep going, but exactly.
[02:01:32.340 --> 02:01:34.340]  Don't be a victim.
[02:01:34.340 --> 02:01:36.340]  That which doesn't kill you makes you stronger.
[02:01:36.340 --> 02:01:37.340]  Now you know.
[02:01:37.340 --> 02:01:38.340]  Now it's a battle wound.
[02:01:38.340 --> 02:01:41.340]  Now you can get even healthier and warn others.
[02:01:41.340 --> 02:01:42.340]  Exactly.
[02:01:42.340 --> 02:01:43.340]  So now I'm fired up.
[02:01:43.340 --> 02:01:45.340]  Like I'm healthier than ever.
[02:01:45.340 --> 02:01:46.340]  I'm exercising.
[02:01:46.340 --> 02:01:48.340]  I'm doing what I need to do to make sure
[02:01:48.340 --> 02:01:51.340]  that my cardio vascular is in the best shape
[02:01:51.340 --> 02:01:53.340]  that it's ever been.
[02:01:53.340 --> 02:01:54.340]  I'm 41.
[02:01:54.340 --> 02:01:55.340]  So whatever.
[02:01:55.340 --> 02:01:57.340]  But I feel like I'm 22.
[02:01:57.340 --> 02:01:58.340]  Beautiful.
[02:01:58.340 --> 02:02:00.340]  But now with the thing with Trump.
[02:02:00.340 --> 02:02:02.340]  Now, part of me is thinking,
[02:02:02.340 --> 02:02:06.340]  I have an idea why Trump isn't going back on the vaccine.
[02:02:06.340 --> 02:02:08.340]  Because at the time,
[02:02:08.340 --> 02:02:10.340]  we know he was being fed false information
[02:02:10.340 --> 02:02:13.340]  listening to the doctors or whatever.
[02:02:13.340 --> 02:02:16.340]  But he was making deals with the FDA
[02:02:16.340 --> 02:02:19.340]  and Big Pharma to get it out quicker
[02:02:19.340 --> 02:02:21.340]  than it should have gone.
[02:02:21.340 --> 02:02:23.340]  So he had the right intentions,
[02:02:23.340 --> 02:02:26.340]  but he knows that part of his doing
[02:02:26.340 --> 02:02:28.340]  was speeding up the process
[02:02:28.340 --> 02:02:29.340]  cutting through the world.
[02:02:29.340 --> 02:02:30.340]  Oh, totally.
[02:02:30.340 --> 02:02:31.340]  He knows he got set up
[02:02:31.340 --> 02:02:33.340]  because he was also trying to get all the therapeutics out there.
[02:02:33.340 --> 02:02:35.340]  They tried to block that.
[02:02:35.340 --> 02:02:37.340]  But he just believed in medicine and said anything.
[02:02:37.340 --> 02:02:38.340]  He just crouched into the system
[02:02:38.340 --> 02:02:40.340]  and now he won't admit he was wrong.
[02:02:40.340 --> 02:02:42.340]  So now if he admits he's wrong,
[02:02:42.340 --> 02:02:44.340]  they're going to take that to him and say,
[02:02:44.340 --> 02:02:46.340]  oh, look at how corrupt you were.
[02:02:46.340 --> 02:02:48.340]  You paid off Big Pharma
[02:02:48.340 --> 02:02:51.340]  or you cut through the red tape with the FDA.
[02:02:51.340 --> 02:02:53.340]  So you can get this shot out.
[02:02:53.340 --> 02:02:54.340]  It's all your fault.
[02:02:54.340 --> 02:02:55.340]  Your fault.
[02:02:55.340 --> 02:02:56.340]  So he'll never go back on it
[02:02:56.340 --> 02:02:58.340]  because it's a double-edged sword.
[02:02:58.340 --> 02:02:59.340]  But he knows.
[02:02:59.340 --> 02:03:01.340]  And he knows it was a mistake.
[02:03:01.340 --> 02:03:04.340]  But I think it's too risky for him to admit it.
[02:03:04.340 --> 02:03:06.340]  But he knows what he did.
[02:03:06.340 --> 02:03:11.340]  And I still think his intentions were in the right place.
[02:03:11.340 --> 02:03:12.340]  Well, that's what I think's happened.
[02:03:12.340 --> 02:03:14.340]  But, you know, regardless,
[02:03:14.340 --> 02:03:18.340]  we know that they're planning even more attacks, more control.
[02:03:18.340 --> 02:03:20.340]  What do you think, Dave, in closing,
[02:03:20.340 --> 02:03:22.340]  that if the deep states have so much trouble,
[02:03:22.340 --> 02:03:24.340]  which I think we all agree that people are waking up to them,
[02:03:24.340 --> 02:03:25.340]  they're not going to give up.
[02:03:25.340 --> 02:03:26.340]  What are they going to do next?
[02:03:26.340 --> 02:03:29.340]  Next move, they're going to cut off the food supply.
[02:03:29.340 --> 02:03:31.340]  They're going to use the weather
[02:03:31.340 --> 02:03:33.340]  which they manipulate out there in the Midwest.
[02:03:33.340 --> 02:03:36.340]  They're going to cause some dramatic weather events,
[02:03:36.340 --> 02:03:41.340]  say, to cut off the food supply in combination with the EMP
[02:03:41.340 --> 02:03:44.340]  or something to take down the Internet grid.
[02:03:44.340 --> 02:03:46.340]  And then when you can't eat,
[02:03:46.340 --> 02:03:49.340]  they're going to force you to follow what they need you to follow.
[02:03:49.340 --> 02:03:50.340]  I totally agree with you.
[02:03:50.340 --> 02:03:52.340]  So people need to know what we've already been through
[02:03:52.340 --> 02:03:55.340]  is just the first leading edge of this attack.
[02:03:55.340 --> 02:03:57.340]  And I don't say that to scare people,
[02:03:57.340 --> 02:03:59.340]  but you can see it's a serious time, folks.
[02:03:59.340 --> 02:04:02.340]  Get ready, get prepared, however you think best.
[02:04:02.340 --> 02:04:04.340]  Thank you so much for the call, Dave.
[02:04:04.340 --> 02:04:05.340]  We're going to go to break.
[02:04:05.340 --> 02:04:08.340]  Come back in 60 seconds, join some stations.
[02:04:08.340 --> 02:04:11.340]  We're going to go to Rod in Kentucky.
[02:04:11.340 --> 02:04:15.340]  Then we're going to go to Justin in Florida.
[02:04:15.340 --> 02:04:16.340]  Carlos hung up.
[02:04:16.340 --> 02:04:17.340]  Sorry, Carlos.
[02:04:17.340 --> 02:04:18.340]  I didn't get to you.
[02:04:18.340 --> 02:04:19.340]  I meant to.
[02:04:19.340 --> 02:04:21.340]  We're going to get to Vincent.
[02:04:21.340 --> 02:04:23.340]  I'm going to bam, bam, bam.
[02:04:23.340 --> 02:04:24.340]  Go to your phone calls.
[02:04:24.340 --> 02:04:26.340]  The problem with the phone system with 20-plus lines
[02:04:26.340 --> 02:04:29.340]  is you get right on, but then it takes a while to get to you.
[02:04:29.340 --> 02:04:31.340]  We're doing the best job we can.
[02:04:31.340 --> 02:04:33.340]  The calls are amazing as well,
[02:04:33.340 --> 02:04:36.340]  so I'm trying to give some of the callers as much time as possible.
[02:04:36.340 --> 02:04:41.340]  Back in 60 seconds, and no matter how good your calls are,
[02:04:41.340 --> 02:04:43.340]  I'm going to five calls next segment.
[02:04:43.340 --> 02:04:46.340]  That means in 10 minutes, you each get about a minute 45.
[02:04:46.340 --> 02:04:48.340]  I got to introduce you and go out.
[02:04:48.340 --> 02:04:52.340]  When we come back, Rod in Kentucky, be ready.
[02:04:52.340 --> 02:04:53.340]  I'm going to write to you.
[02:04:53.340 --> 02:04:54.340]  Make your point.
[02:04:54.340 --> 02:04:55.340]  We're on the next person.
[02:04:55.340 --> 02:04:59.340]  Stay with us.
[02:04:59.340 --> 02:05:02.340]  I just want to say about Diet Force.
[02:05:02.340 --> 02:05:04.340]  Diet Force is amazing.
[02:05:04.340 --> 02:05:06.340]  I'm 45, and I have bits.
[02:05:06.340 --> 02:05:09.340]  I go to the gym, and I have bits that won't move.
[02:05:09.340 --> 02:05:12.340]  And Diet Force has helped me move those bits.
[02:05:12.340 --> 02:05:15.340]  Like, under my pecs, my belly.
[02:05:15.340 --> 02:05:18.340]  I'm just taking Diet Force two tablets a day.
[02:05:18.340 --> 02:05:24.340]  Man, if you're struggling to get, like, chip shape for the ladies,
[02:05:24.340 --> 02:05:26.340]  mate, Diet Force is the go.
[02:05:26.340 --> 02:05:29.340]  You have to get to Diet Force and have two a day,
[02:05:29.340 --> 02:05:31.340]  and just keep active.
[02:05:31.340 --> 02:05:34.340]  Infowarsstore.com, X7 Diet Force.

[02:06:08.340 --> 02:06:15.340]  It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the Info War.
[02:06:15.340 --> 02:06:20.340]  We are now into hour number three, taking your phone calls of the nature of the
[02:06:20.340 --> 02:06:23.340]  universe and reality, and what's coming next.
[02:06:23.340 --> 02:06:24.340]  Rod in Kentucky.
[02:06:24.340 --> 02:06:25.340]  Thanks for calling.
[02:06:25.340 --> 02:06:26.340]  You're on the air.
[02:06:26.340 --> 02:06:27.340]  Alex, this is Rod Butler.
[02:06:27.340 --> 02:06:28.340]  How are you doing?
[02:06:28.340 --> 02:06:29.340]  Good, brother.
[02:06:29.340 --> 02:06:30.340]  Go ahead.
[02:06:30.340 --> 02:06:33.340]  Hey, listen, I'm a nervous wreck now.
[02:06:33.340 --> 02:06:34.340]  It's the first time caller.
[02:06:34.340 --> 02:06:36.340]  I just want to tell you that I use all your products.
[02:06:36.340 --> 02:06:42.340]  I've been listening to you since the AOL days in the mid 90s, early 90s.
[02:06:42.340 --> 02:06:47.340]  Man, you have, it's been hard to be a fan of yours because everybody has always thought
[02:06:47.340 --> 02:06:50.340]  I was crazy, but you are spot on.
[02:06:50.340 --> 02:06:54.340]  And I want to thank you for waking me up and waking all the people around me up.
[02:06:54.340 --> 02:06:56.340]  Hey, we've all been waking each other up, brother.
[02:06:56.340 --> 02:06:59.340]  It's good to have you for all these years to talk to you.
[02:06:59.340 --> 02:07:01.340]  What do you think's coming next?
[02:07:01.340 --> 02:07:02.340]  I don't know.
[02:07:02.340 --> 02:07:03.340]  I agree with the last caller.
[02:07:03.340 --> 02:07:06.340]  I think they're going to try to do something to our food and they're definitely trying
[02:07:06.340 --> 02:07:08.340]  to shut down our power.
[02:07:08.340 --> 02:07:11.340]  They don't want us to have electricity or food.
[02:07:11.340 --> 02:07:15.340]  This leadership we have, they all look like cartoon characters.
[02:07:15.340 --> 02:07:22.340]  They look like the Looney Tunes parade when they come down the aisle at a thing last night.
[02:07:22.340 --> 02:07:24.340]  They're trying to smother us out, man.
[02:07:24.340 --> 02:07:31.340]  They want to have only insane people in power and they want insane people that will follow their orders.
[02:07:31.340 --> 02:07:35.340]  Humanity is being maneuvered into Armageddon.
[02:07:35.340 --> 02:07:36.340]  I totally agree.
[02:07:36.340 --> 02:07:37.340]  How do we stop it?
[02:07:37.340 --> 02:07:38.340]  Yes, sir.
[02:07:38.340 --> 02:07:44.340]  We've got to wait for more people up and people have got to get up off of their butt and take some kind of action.
[02:07:44.340 --> 02:07:46.340]  I don't know what that is.
[02:07:46.340 --> 02:07:49.340]  We need leaders who will help us do that.
[02:07:49.340 --> 02:07:54.340]  The biggest thing is pull our children out of the public schools, disengage from the system as much as we can and just warn everybody.
[02:07:54.340 --> 02:07:55.340]  Thank you for the call.
[02:07:55.340 --> 02:07:56.340]  Great call.
[02:07:56.340 --> 02:07:58.340]  Let's talk to Justin in Florida.
[02:07:58.340 --> 02:08:00.340]  Go ahead, Justin.
[02:08:00.340 --> 02:08:01.340]  Hey, Alex.
[02:08:01.340 --> 02:08:03.340]  I'll get right to it.
[02:08:03.340 --> 02:08:13.340]  I've been thinking about when I've been thinking about Trump and the vaccine and I think to myself, what's more deadly, the shot or the virus or the lockdown?
[02:08:13.340 --> 02:08:18.340]  Clearly, the lockdown to me was the most deadly aspect of this whole ordeal.
[02:08:18.340 --> 02:08:24.340]  The globalist said they needed the backs to stop the lockdown.
[02:08:24.340 --> 02:08:35.340]  The operation warp speed, to me, was more about getting therapeutics out there, hydration, chlorophyll, and I have a medicine which would have actually thwarted the vaccine issue.
[02:08:35.340 --> 02:08:42.340]  And with Trump, there has been some signal and not the noise.
[02:08:42.340 --> 02:08:51.340]  There was a show or a rally he did and Trump said, leave the kids alone and he made a symbol to their heart.
[02:08:51.340 --> 02:08:59.340]  He said also on the water cooler with David Brody, he is concerned about potential vaccine injuries.
[02:08:59.340 --> 02:09:10.340]  And he said, you know, and at one point, I think, you know, and on the David O'Reilly show, he said, you know, he talked about people criticizing him and the vaccines.
[02:09:10.340 --> 02:09:12.340]  He sort of said, you're not helping our cause.
[02:09:12.340 --> 02:09:23.340]  And I think this aspect of it, that the vaccines thwarted the lockdown, and if we hadn't had the lockdown, you know, if we hadn't had the vaccine to thwart the lockdown, then you would be, it would be over by now.
[02:09:23.340 --> 02:09:28.340]  You would have total chaos in the street and, you know.
[02:09:28.340 --> 02:09:33.340]  Well, there's no doubt they're going to try to have the lockdowns go forever, like two years of Third World, only six months here.
[02:09:33.340 --> 02:09:38.340]  But I get how they set him up, but it doesn't mean the vaccine saved us from that.
[02:09:38.340 --> 02:09:42.340]  They said, oh, sir, sign this warp speed, we can get it done quicker and unlock things.
[02:09:42.340 --> 02:09:43.340]  So he bought into it.
[02:09:43.340 --> 02:09:45.340]  And then now he won't admit he's wrong.
[02:09:45.340 --> 02:09:46.340]  Right.
[02:09:46.340 --> 02:09:53.340]  Well, there's some aspects of that that, you know, well, even, you know, Trump's not the one giving it to six year olds and pregnant women and we're the only country in the world.
[02:09:53.340 --> 02:09:54.340]  No, no, I hear you.
[02:09:54.340 --> 02:09:55.340]  He's come out against that.
[02:09:55.340 --> 02:09:56.340]  That's good.
[02:09:56.340 --> 02:09:57.340]  Great call. Appreciate your call.
[02:09:57.340 --> 02:09:59.340]  We're going to get five calls in the segment.
[02:09:59.340 --> 02:10:00.340]  Vincent in Canada.
[02:10:00.340 --> 02:10:01.340]  Go ahead.
[02:10:01.340 --> 02:10:02.340]  Thanks for calling.
[02:10:02.340 --> 02:10:04.340]  Oh, good to talk to you, Alex.
[02:10:04.340 --> 02:10:09.340]  Listen, I was wondering if you've ever given thought to kleptoparasitism.
[02:10:09.340 --> 02:10:12.340]  Kleptoparasitism.
[02:10:12.340 --> 02:10:13.340]  Yeah.
[02:10:13.340 --> 02:10:14.340]  Kleptoparasite.
[02:10:14.340 --> 02:10:15.340]  It's a clinical term for cuckoos.
[02:10:15.340 --> 02:10:20.340]  And you find cuckoo birds, cuckoo bees, cuckoo wasps.
[02:10:20.340 --> 02:10:27.340]  And when the Hunger Games came out back in the Northeast, I just thought, wow, the ruling class, there's really something wrong with it.
[02:10:27.340 --> 02:10:33.340]  So maybe like you and your colleagues, your wonderful crews there have been saying.
[02:10:33.340 --> 02:10:39.340]  Maybe they're not human, but I don't think they necessarily be alien.
[02:10:39.340 --> 02:10:44.340]  They strike me as being closer to home than, you know, it's discomforting.
[02:10:44.340 --> 02:10:45.340]  Yeah.
[02:10:45.340 --> 02:10:48.340]  Well, the globalists say they want to be their own species.
[02:10:48.340 --> 02:10:52.340]  And I guess you can say sociopaths and psychopaths are kind of their own group of humans.
[02:10:52.340 --> 02:10:57.340]  But I know about cuckoo birds and things, but I'll have to look this up.
[02:10:57.340 --> 02:10:59.340]  What is a cuckoo bee?
[02:10:59.340 --> 02:11:01.340]  Yeah, it's fascinating.
[02:11:01.340 --> 02:11:08.340]  Back in the 90s, when cable television came, when the accident cable television happened, there was a channel called the Learning Channel.
[02:11:08.340 --> 02:11:19.340]  So I'm not fairly familiar with the television, but there was a documentary about the European honey bee and its cuckoo bee.
[02:11:19.340 --> 02:11:21.340]  And it.
[02:11:21.340 --> 02:11:23.340]  Guys, look at the cuckoo bee.
[02:11:23.340 --> 02:11:25.340]  So is it a false bee?
[02:11:25.340 --> 02:11:27.340]  No, it's nature.
[02:11:27.340 --> 02:11:36.340]  It's a form of, they steal the host offspring, the eggs, or the larvae, the grub, and then they lay their own, they deposit their own eggs.
[02:11:36.340 --> 02:11:37.340]  So they steal.
[02:11:37.340 --> 02:11:40.340]  Oh, yeah, they have like the cowbird does that.
[02:11:40.340 --> 02:11:41.340]  Okay.
[02:11:41.340 --> 02:11:42.340]  Well, I think I've read about that.
[02:11:42.340 --> 02:11:43.340]  I'll look into that.
[02:11:43.340 --> 02:11:44.340]  Thank you so much.
[02:11:44.340 --> 02:11:45.340]  Well, these calls are cool.
[02:11:45.340 --> 02:11:47.340]  Let's talk to Alan in Oregon.
[02:11:47.340 --> 02:11:48.340]  You're on the air.
[02:11:48.340 --> 02:11:49.340]  Go ahead.
[02:11:49.340 --> 02:11:50.340]  Oh, sir.
[02:11:50.340 --> 02:11:51.340]  Nice to speak with you, Alex.
[02:11:51.340 --> 02:11:53.340]  Nice to talk to you.
[02:11:53.340 --> 02:12:04.340]  I just wanted to thank you, sir, I found you back in 07 after Googling fluoride effects because doctors are trying to give my son, my newborn son, fluoride drops in his medicine.
[02:12:04.340 --> 02:12:06.340]  Or not even his medicine was a vitamin drop.
[02:12:06.340 --> 02:12:13.340]  Oh, and they admit no child needs any fluoride till age five, even if it's pure calcium fluoride.
[02:12:13.340 --> 02:12:17.340]  They were trying to give them, oh yeah, the store, it says fluoride water for babies.
[02:12:17.340 --> 02:12:18.340]  It's total evil.
[02:12:18.340 --> 02:12:20.340]  Lowers the IQ.
[02:12:20.340 --> 02:12:29.340]  It was terrible and I even said to the doctor, I said, you know, I know that fluoride is bad and that it says on the toothpaste thing, not to swallow fluoride.
[02:12:29.340 --> 02:12:30.340]  And she says, oh, no, it's fine.
[02:12:30.340 --> 02:12:31.340]  This is a different fluoride.
[02:12:31.340 --> 02:12:32.340]  It's good for his teeth.
[02:12:32.340 --> 02:12:34.340]  And I was like, he doesn't even have teeth.
[02:12:34.340 --> 02:12:35.340]  What are we doing here?
[02:12:35.340 --> 02:12:37.340]  So I went home, Googled and searched this.
[02:12:37.340 --> 02:12:38.340]  I found some videos of you.
[02:12:38.340 --> 02:12:39.340]  I've been listening ever since.
[02:12:39.340 --> 02:12:41.340]  So thank you.
[02:12:41.340 --> 02:12:49.340]  I've got a, I purchased your HDH max boost and that stuff's really changed my life just in the matter of my sleeping.
[02:12:49.340 --> 02:12:52.340]  I'm wondering when you guys are going to get that back.
[02:12:52.340 --> 02:12:57.340]  But I used to, I used to sweat crazily at night every single night with waking up drenched.
[02:12:57.340 --> 02:13:00.340]  And I went to the doctor that said, Hey, what's going on with us?
[02:13:00.340 --> 02:13:01.340]  Normal with some guys.
[02:13:01.340 --> 02:13:03.340]  I thought maybe this has to be hormone related.
[02:13:03.340 --> 02:13:08.340]  And so I started taking that stuff two months ago and I can sleep like that's the other thing.
[02:13:08.340 --> 02:13:10.340]  I can sleep so well.
[02:13:10.340 --> 02:13:13.340]  I normally sleep four hours, five hours.
[02:13:13.340 --> 02:13:17.340]  Well, we only got a limited supply and then we're hoping to get more in very, very soon.
[02:13:17.340 --> 02:13:21.340]  I mean, I appreciate your point on that.
[02:13:21.340 --> 02:13:22.340]  Anything else, Alan?
[02:13:22.340 --> 02:13:23.340]  On Elon Musk?
[02:13:23.340 --> 02:13:24.340]  Yeah.
[02:13:24.340 --> 02:13:25.340]  Yeah.
[02:13:25.340 --> 02:13:26.340]  Last thing was on Elon Musk.
[02:13:26.340 --> 02:13:33.340]  I keep thinking back to, you know, the spars document, the pandemic, the 2025, 2028 document.
[02:13:33.340 --> 02:13:35.340]  That's really what we're living in now.
[02:13:35.340 --> 02:13:39.340]  And I think back to the, to the EPI girl.
[02:13:39.340 --> 02:13:45.340]  And I'm wondering, you know, is Elon Musk sparking this to get people to discredit the government?
[02:13:45.340 --> 02:13:52.340]  If he's this catalyst for this, for this, you know, for that type of event or, or what have you,
[02:13:52.340 --> 02:13:57.340]  is he trying to get people to buy into corporations instead of the government or that's kind of my theory.
[02:13:57.340 --> 02:14:03.340]  Well, that's what the globalists do is they control the government with their money and then they blame the government of what they've done.
[02:14:03.340 --> 02:14:08.340]  I'm going to blame the government all day, but they're like the capo under the dawn or the mob boss.
[02:14:08.340 --> 02:14:12.340]  So the government's the capo, but the mob boss is the corporation.
[02:14:12.340 --> 02:14:18.340]  I mean, I think he sees the world waking up and I think he wants to basically play both sides.
[02:14:18.340 --> 02:14:19.340]  Sure.
[02:14:19.340 --> 02:14:20.340]  Okay.
[02:14:20.340 --> 02:14:21.340]  Very good.
[02:14:21.340 --> 02:14:22.340]  Thanks for the call, Alan.
[02:14:22.340 --> 02:14:23.340]  Thank you.
[02:14:23.340 --> 02:14:24.340]  Dennis in Kentucky.
[02:14:24.340 --> 02:14:25.340]  Go ahead.
[02:14:25.340 --> 02:14:28.340]  How are you doing, Alex?
[02:14:28.340 --> 02:14:29.340]  I'm good, Dennis.
[02:14:29.340 --> 02:14:30.340]  Go ahead.
[02:14:30.340 --> 02:14:32.340]  InfowarsStore.com.
[02:14:32.340 --> 02:14:35.340]  Thank you for being always the voice of the people.
[02:14:35.340 --> 02:14:40.340]  Also, I'm happy, naive people month.
[02:14:40.340 --> 02:14:45.340]  If you have a problem, Biden is with Biden is this mass bench sliding off.
[02:14:45.340 --> 02:14:53.340]  But when I logged in today, I've seen the headline, you know, as soon as I got on you on and it said the FBI needs another 9 11.
[02:14:53.340 --> 02:14:58.340]  Well, I think that that 9 11 would be a cruise ship in the summertime.
[02:14:58.340 --> 02:14:59.340]  It's going to pop.
[02:14:59.340 --> 02:15:00.340]  Hold on, Dennis.
[02:15:00.340 --> 02:15:01.340]  Don't hang up.
[02:15:01.340 --> 02:15:02.340]  I don't want to cut you off.
[02:15:02.340 --> 02:15:03.340]  We would hold.
[02:15:03.340 --> 02:15:05.340]  Please sir, we'll go to break for a few minutes.
[02:15:05.340 --> 02:15:06.340]  Come right back with Dennis.
[02:15:06.340 --> 02:15:17.340]  We're going to go to Richard and we're going to go to everybody else, especially holding the order your calls received, like Peter.
[02:15:17.340 --> 02:15:20.340]  And then Carlos in Canada was holding, but I guess got back in.
[02:15:20.340 --> 02:15:21.340]  So I'm going to finish up with Dennis.
[02:15:21.340 --> 02:15:22.340]  I'm going to go to Carlos.
[02:15:22.340 --> 02:15:23.340]  Then I'm going to go to Richard.
[02:15:23.340 --> 02:15:24.340]  Then I'm going to go to Peter.
[02:15:24.340 --> 02:15:25.340]  Everybody else.
[02:15:25.340 --> 02:15:26.340]  So we're going to go to break.
[02:15:26.340 --> 02:15:27.340]  Come back.
[02:15:27.340 --> 02:15:30.340]  But yeah, I mean, guess that the enemies plan in hard.
[02:15:30.340 --> 02:15:34.340]  We know they're going to blow something up or do something big and be the savior.
[02:15:34.340 --> 02:15:36.340]  The question is, what is it going to be?
[02:15:36.340 --> 02:15:38.340]  And so we're going to get Dennis's take on that.
[02:15:38.340 --> 02:15:39.340]  We come back.
[02:15:39.340 --> 02:15:40.340]  Please don't forget.
[02:15:40.340 --> 02:15:41.340]  I just want to wake people up.
[02:15:41.340 --> 02:15:44.340]  Hundreds and hundreds of band people are at band.video.
[02:15:44.340 --> 02:15:46.340]  Hundreds of contributors, band.video.
[02:15:46.340 --> 02:15:47.340]  Please share those links.
[02:15:47.340 --> 02:15:48.340]  A lot of great videos.
[02:15:48.340 --> 02:15:49.340]  Band.video.

[02:15:52.340 --> 02:15:53.340]  We got to bring the truth to them.
[02:15:53.340 --> 02:15:54.340]  Band.video.

[02:17:26.340 --> 02:17:27.340]  They're coming for you and your family.
[02:17:27.340 --> 02:17:28.340]  They're coming for me.
[02:17:28.340 --> 02:17:30.340]  They're coming for the children.
[02:17:30.340 --> 02:17:32.340]  But to get to the children, they've got to get through us first.
[02:17:32.340 --> 02:17:36.340]  These monsters are all over television wanting to give these shots to newborn babies.
[02:17:36.340 --> 02:17:37.340]  They're already given to pregnant women.
[02:17:37.340 --> 02:17:39.340]  Miscarriages are off the chart.
[02:17:39.340 --> 02:17:44.340]  80 plus percent increase in miscarriages in the first two prime ministers after these
[02:17:44.340 --> 02:17:45.340]  poison shots.
[02:17:45.340 --> 02:17:49.340]  We can and will save the children and they are counting on us.
[02:17:49.340 --> 02:17:50.340]  Let's do it together.
[02:17:50.340 --> 02:17:52.340]  And the fight starts at infowars.com.
[02:17:52.340 --> 02:17:56.340]  And the fight continues with your financial support at infowarstore.com.
[02:17:56.340 --> 02:17:57.340]  Now take action now.
[02:17:57.340 --> 02:18:01.340]  The most banned man in America, Alex Jones.
[02:18:05.340 --> 02:18:07.340]  I want you all to know something.
[02:18:07.340 --> 02:18:09.340]  Alex Jones was right.
[02:18:09.340 --> 02:18:12.340]  Alex is right about far more things wrong.
[02:18:12.340 --> 02:18:15.340]  Alex has been right on court over a decade.
[02:18:15.340 --> 02:18:20.340]  I don't care how you slice it, dice it, flip it up or rub it down.
[02:18:20.340 --> 02:18:22.340]  Alex Jones was right.
[02:18:22.340 --> 02:18:25.340]  Think about how frustrated we are if you've been awake for a year or two.
[02:18:25.340 --> 02:18:29.340]  Imagine being like an Alex Jones or those guys who've been awake for like decades.
[02:18:29.340 --> 02:18:32.340]  Alex Jones called this years ago.
[02:18:32.340 --> 02:18:33.340]  Years ago.
[02:18:33.340 --> 02:18:35.340]  Alex Jones never bought the Russia hoax.
[02:18:35.340 --> 02:18:37.340]  Not for a second.
[02:18:37.340 --> 02:18:39.340]  You are one of the great thinkers of this.
[02:18:39.340 --> 02:18:42.340]  You are a martyr to the First Amendment.
[02:18:42.340 --> 02:18:45.340]  The government, beers, Alex Jones.
[02:18:45.340 --> 02:18:50.340]  That's why the globalists hate me is because I'm exposing their corporate worldwide tyranny.
[02:18:52.340 --> 02:18:54.340]  AlexJonesLive.com
[02:18:57.340 --> 02:19:03.340]  If you go to onlinehealthnow.com, connect with trusted and unbiased doctors at the wellness company.
[02:19:03.340 --> 02:19:07.340]  And I tell you, I'm honored to be the chief scientific officer of the company.
[02:19:07.340 --> 02:19:11.340]  I contribute with like so many else do there, so many wonderful doctors.
[02:19:11.340 --> 02:19:17.340]  Far and away, the most popular product is Dr. Vandewater's detoxification supplement.
[02:19:17.340 --> 02:19:19.340]  That features natokinase.
[02:19:19.340 --> 02:19:21.340]  It's a natural proteolytic enzyme.
[02:19:21.340 --> 02:19:27.340]  This one is the only enzyme that we're aware of right now that dissolves the spike protein.
[02:19:27.340 --> 02:19:28.340]  This is very important.
[02:19:28.340 --> 02:19:32.340]  The spike protein is loaded in the body with the COVID-19 infection and definitely with the vaccines.
[02:19:32.340 --> 02:19:34.340]  People are lower with the spike protein.
[02:19:34.340 --> 02:19:35.340]  They don't feel well.
[02:19:35.340 --> 02:19:37.340]  This is a potential solution.
[02:19:37.340 --> 02:19:40.340]  Hydroxychloroquine comes from a natural substance.
[02:19:40.340 --> 02:19:43.340]  So does ivermectin and now natokinase.
[02:19:43.340 --> 02:19:44.340]  Isn't it interesting?
[02:19:44.340 --> 02:19:50.340]  Natural substances in a sense combating this man-made disaster, SARS-CoV-2 in the vaccines.
[02:19:50.340 --> 02:19:53.340]  Onlinehealthnow.com, thank you for your support.
[02:19:53.340 --> 02:19:55.340]  And thank you for getting into that because it's important.
[02:19:55.340 --> 02:19:57.340]  You didn't come here to do that, but I made you do it.
[02:19:57.340 --> 02:20:09.340]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[02:20:27.340 --> 02:20:54.340]  Watching the chemtrails over the country club.
[02:20:54.340 --> 02:20:58.340]  We're under attack.
[02:20:58.340 --> 02:21:00.340]  We're being poisoned.
[02:21:00.340 --> 02:21:02.340]  We just sit here in the country club.
[02:21:02.340 --> 02:21:05.340]  It's the movies and the restaurants and the pool halls.
[02:21:05.340 --> 02:21:06.340]  And I'm not knocking any of that.
[02:21:06.340 --> 02:21:13.340]  I love movies and restaurants and pool halls and football games and basketball games and track meets and all the fun stuff we all love and fishing and hunting.
[02:21:13.340 --> 02:21:18.340]  But while that's going on, the globalists are playing God manipulating us all.
[02:21:18.340 --> 02:21:23.340]  Dennis, you were talking about what's coming next and the summer bubble gonna pop.
[02:21:23.340 --> 02:21:25.340]  You're talking about false flag.
[02:21:25.340 --> 02:21:27.340]  Tell us what you got for us.
[02:21:27.340 --> 02:21:29.340]  That's exactly what I believe.
[02:21:29.340 --> 02:21:39.340]  I mean, if that's truly, you know, how things is moving, they need something that's going to give that immediate knee jerk reaction, something to tug on the people's hearts.
[02:21:39.340 --> 02:21:45.340]  So with that being said, something of that nature that has a slew of people on a targeted ship.
[02:21:45.340 --> 02:21:49.340]  See, they can dock that ship and even claim COVID or anything.
[02:21:49.340 --> 02:21:54.340]  Which later will come out that shedding is going to be a problem.
[02:21:54.340 --> 02:22:01.340]  I mean, it's very simple to do if you over, over look at something of that magnitude.
[02:22:01.340 --> 02:22:04.340]  That's what's going to be able to keep them from keep doing it.
[02:22:04.340 --> 02:22:07.340]  You're saying they already hit us with a bio attack.
[02:22:07.340 --> 02:22:09.340]  Their whole posture is a bio attack.
[02:22:09.340 --> 02:22:11.340]  You're saying you think the next thing will be a bio attack.
[02:22:11.340 --> 02:22:13.340]  I think you're probably right.
[02:22:13.340 --> 02:22:17.340]  Yes, because in that mass setting of a cruise ship.
[02:22:17.340 --> 02:22:23.340]  Now they're going to blame it on who they blame it on, but it's just the initial act of its own.
[02:22:23.340 --> 02:22:25.340]  That's what's going to pull it.
[02:22:25.340 --> 02:22:33.340]  And that's going to happen because all I'm saying now is ask for cruise ship.
[02:22:33.340 --> 02:22:35.340]  Sorry, sir.
[02:22:35.340 --> 02:22:36.340]  I think it's probable.
[02:22:36.340 --> 02:22:38.340]  I mean, there's no telling what they're going to do.
[02:22:38.340 --> 02:22:39.340]  Thank you so much, Dennis.
[02:22:39.340 --> 02:22:42.340]  Let's go to Carlos and Canada. Carlos, thanks for holding. Go ahead.
[02:22:42.340 --> 02:22:44.340]  Thank you very much, Alex.
[02:22:44.340 --> 02:22:49.340]  I've always thought this was a lot of distractions and a lot of smoke and mirrors.
[02:22:49.340 --> 02:22:57.340]  I used the term before to distract from the real financial control that is being exercised.
[02:22:57.340 --> 02:23:03.340]  I believe that in the near future, there's going to be what it's called a great reset.
[02:23:03.340 --> 02:23:08.340]  But you know, the word reset comes from idea of resetting your computer.
[02:23:08.340 --> 02:23:10.340]  And when you reset your computer, what do you do?
[02:23:10.340 --> 02:23:15.340]  You turn the power off and then what you upload new information or new programs
[02:23:15.340 --> 02:23:21.340]  and then you reboot your programs into the reset, you see, into the new situation with the computer.
[02:23:21.340 --> 02:23:30.340]  I think that the idea of having a cyber attack where the electrical systems go down for a while
[02:23:30.340 --> 02:23:34.340]  had been talked about by several people in the World Economic Forum.
[02:23:34.340 --> 02:23:42.340]  Well, I was about to say Klaus Schwab and them drool and say a cyber attack will make COVID look like nothing.
[02:23:42.340 --> 02:23:45.340]  And all their PR people are saying cyber attack, cyber attack.
[02:23:45.340 --> 02:23:49.340]  Right. But you know, when you buy a house, you get a title deed, right?
[02:23:49.340 --> 02:23:50.340]  Yes.
[02:23:50.340 --> 02:23:54.340]  You know, okay. So how many people have a house that don't have a title deed?
[02:23:54.340 --> 02:23:56.340]  Think about it. A lot of people.
[02:23:56.340 --> 02:23:58.340]  No. Everybody has a title deed.
[02:23:58.340 --> 02:24:01.340]  There's a notary and they pay welcome taxes or whatever it is.
[02:24:01.340 --> 02:24:03.340]  Here in Canada, everybody's got a title deed.
[02:24:03.340 --> 02:24:08.340]  When you buy a lot of money, you put into shares in the stock market.
[02:24:08.340 --> 02:24:12.340]  What do you get for it if you don't take the certificate and you deliver it to your home?
[02:24:12.340 --> 02:24:16.340]  You get what? The word of a stock broker saying that, oh, we have your certificate.
[02:24:16.340 --> 02:24:20.340]  But you said something really smart. Most of the time it's not even in your name.
[02:24:20.340 --> 02:24:24.340]  They've already pledged it to another investment.
[02:24:24.340 --> 02:24:28.340]  Right. And they vote your vote in that company direction.
[02:24:28.340 --> 02:24:30.340]  If you don't like what Walt Disney is doing.
[02:24:30.340 --> 02:24:34.340]  The majority of the money is in BlackRock. They vote for you.
[02:24:34.340 --> 02:24:38.340]  Yeah. And they vote what they want, not for you. They vote what they want.
[02:24:38.340 --> 02:24:40.340]  And if you think that after...
[02:24:40.340 --> 02:24:44.340]  No, you just said it. The big fraud is people that hold stock,
[02:24:44.340 --> 02:24:47.340]  the stock was always about power in the company for the direction of the company,
[02:24:47.340 --> 02:24:51.340]  not just an investment. People that advocate their responsibility with stock.
[02:24:51.340 --> 02:24:53.340]  So how do we change that?
[02:24:53.340 --> 02:24:57.340]  Well, very simple. You simply say, hey, there's a power failure.
[02:24:57.340 --> 02:25:03.340]  And I don't have a... If there's a disaster, for instance, an economic disaster,
[02:25:03.340 --> 02:25:07.340]  and you don't have a title deed to your home, how are you going to prove that it's your home?
[02:25:07.340 --> 02:25:09.340]  If they tell you, we don't know anymore...
[02:25:09.340 --> 02:25:12.340]  I agree. The cyber attacks meant to wipe out the old system.
[02:25:12.340 --> 02:25:16.340]  So many times on 9-11 they blew up the CIA building, Building 7,
[02:25:16.340 --> 02:25:18.340]  they had all the government documents in it.
[02:25:18.340 --> 02:25:23.340]  They will use these disasters to get rid of the deeds to absolutely steal your money.
[02:25:23.340 --> 02:25:27.340]  Exactly. And so if you really want to slow the process down,
[02:25:27.340 --> 02:25:31.340]  if you really want to make your companies accountable to what you want,
[02:25:31.340 --> 02:25:34.340]  you don't want your children's minds bogged, polluted.
[02:25:34.340 --> 02:25:37.340]  Don't let these guys vote at the board of directors, at their shares.
[02:25:37.340 --> 02:25:42.340]  Don't let them tell that they have $30 trillion under management when they don't.
[02:25:42.340 --> 02:25:46.340]  They have management of shares of people that have worked very hard to pay for those shares.
[02:25:46.340 --> 02:25:49.340]  They haven't been brokers and they vote whatever they want with it.
[02:25:49.340 --> 02:25:53.340]  So the solution is take the certificates, deliver them...
[02:25:53.340 --> 02:25:58.340]  I agree. How do we democratize shareholder votes?
[02:25:58.340 --> 02:26:04.340]  And protect yourself against the reset because if there is a financial clean-out
[02:26:04.340 --> 02:26:09.340]  and they don't have any records of your shares like they didn't have your gold certificate...
[02:26:09.340 --> 02:26:12.340]  And by the way, what you're saying is key because we have the FDIC here
[02:26:12.340 --> 02:26:16.340]  and other central bank insurance corporations saying that things are going down,
[02:26:16.340 --> 02:26:20.340]  there's about to be a mail in, they're about to reset and take part of your account.
[02:26:20.340 --> 02:26:24.340]  You're absolutely right. Documenting what you actually have is key.
[02:26:24.340 --> 02:26:27.340]  It's key. And not only that, it hasn't happened yet.
[02:26:27.340 --> 02:26:32.340]  But when they go to influence governments, like they go to influence the pope,
[02:26:32.340 --> 02:26:35.340]  they tell the pope, hey, we have $20 trillion under management.
[02:26:35.340 --> 02:26:40.340]  We're big shots. You know, you say, wait a second, deliver first, okay?
[02:26:40.340 --> 02:26:44.340]  Give us the administrative power. We're the shareholders.
[02:26:44.340 --> 02:26:47.340]  You're not the shareholder. We're the shareholders. These are administrators...
[02:26:47.340 --> 02:26:50.340]  Well, that's already happening with legislatures saying no,
[02:26:50.340 --> 02:26:53.340]  with state funds being invested with Black Rock and Vanguard.
[02:26:53.340 --> 02:26:59.340]  And there was companies that came out and helped shareholders vote on a digital proven platform
[02:26:59.340 --> 02:27:03.340]  where you could check your vote, know it's what the vote you made, and then see that algorithm.
[02:27:03.340 --> 02:27:05.340]  I don't know how else you would do it.
[02:27:05.340 --> 02:27:11.340]  Imagine the new future would be blocked voting by democratized shareholders at those shareholder meetings.
[02:27:11.340 --> 02:27:15.340]  Exactly. And you must ask your broker, thank you very much.
[02:27:15.340 --> 02:27:18.340]  You have my money. Here's the stock. Give me the certificate.
[02:27:18.340 --> 02:27:21.340]  It can be sold anytime. I just bring it in. You pay me.
[02:27:21.340 --> 02:27:24.340]  Give me a check within seven days, five business days.
[02:27:24.340 --> 02:27:26.340]  So, you know, fairness, okay?
[02:27:26.340 --> 02:27:29.340]  Why don't you hold your shares in case there's a power failure
[02:27:29.340 --> 02:27:33.340]  and you can't get your shares approved that you ever had?
[02:27:33.340 --> 02:27:36.340]  And a microcosm of that is holding a lot of your money in cash,
[02:27:36.340 --> 02:27:39.340]  the way the system works, whether you want to get rid of cash.
[02:27:39.340 --> 02:27:42.340]  It gives you that little bit of a hedge. Once they get rid of the cash,
[02:27:42.340 --> 02:27:45.340]  can you imagine what it's going to be like, Carlos?
[02:27:45.340 --> 02:27:49.340]  Well, I imagine it, of course, because in the future, there's going to be a company
[02:27:49.340 --> 02:27:53.340]  that's going to be created called eBarter, just like eBay,
[02:27:53.340 --> 02:27:56.340]  where you are going to be able to barter and somebody likes your product,
[02:27:56.340 --> 02:28:00.340]  they're going to say, you have so many credits in your eBarter account or whatever,
[02:28:00.340 --> 02:28:04.340]  and then you just barter your services or whatever.
[02:28:04.340 --> 02:28:09.340]  And you're forward-looking. This is exactly, instead of groveling to the system and opposing it,
[02:28:09.340 --> 02:28:13.340]  which we should, building new systems is how we win.
[02:28:13.340 --> 02:28:18.340]  Doctor, listen, there was a gentleman whose name I will mention to you in future calls,
[02:28:18.340 --> 02:28:22.340]  and he said to President Kennedy, President Kennedy,
[02:28:22.340 --> 02:28:26.340]  I've written a book about it, I've talked about it, people that are workers,
[02:28:26.340 --> 02:28:28.340]  they are entitled to own their company as well.
[02:28:28.340 --> 02:28:32.340]  It's not just a question of working to make people rich.
[02:28:32.340 --> 02:28:36.340]  It's a question of working so the condition of the human being is better.
[02:28:36.340 --> 02:28:41.340]  President Kennedy discussed this with President De Gaulle, okay, and President in 1961,
[02:28:41.340 --> 02:28:46.340]  and President De Gaulle in 1969, trying to move through a referendum,
[02:28:46.340 --> 02:28:50.340]  the sharing of the wealth of the companies with the workers, okay?
[02:28:50.340 --> 02:28:55.340]  And that's real capitalism. All right, thanks for the call. More calls straight ahead.
[02:28:55.340 --> 02:28:58.340]  Stay with us. Thank you.
[02:28:58.340 --> 02:29:03.340]  Well, I have fantastic stuff. Diet Force. Diet Force is amazing.
[02:29:03.340 --> 02:29:08.340]  I'm 45, and I have bits. I go to the gym, and I have bits that won't move.
[02:29:08.340 --> 02:29:11.340]  And Diet Force has helped me move those bits.
[02:29:11.340 --> 02:29:17.340]  Like, under my pecs, my belly, I'm just taking Diet Force to tablets a day.
[02:29:17.340 --> 02:29:23.340]  Man, if you're, like, struggling to get, like, chip shaped for the ladies,
[02:29:23.340 --> 02:29:29.340]  mate, Diet Force is the go. You have to get to Diet Force and have it to a day,
[02:29:29.340 --> 02:29:30.340]  and just keep active.

[02:29:41.340 --> 02:29:42.340]  Thank you so much for the call, Grant.
[02:29:42.340 --> 02:29:43.340]  Oh, come on.
[02:29:43.340 --> 02:29:46.340]  God bless Australia. We'll be right back, folks. Don't go anywhere.

[02:29:58.340 --> 02:30:04.340]  In the year 2000, Alex Jones' film Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove
[02:30:04.340 --> 02:30:13.340]  showed the world how our so-called elite leaders practice mock ritual sacrifices in private.
[02:30:13.340 --> 02:30:20.340]  In 2007, Alex Jones releases Endgame, exposing the world elite's plans for covertly using
[02:30:20.340 --> 02:30:23.340]  biological weapons against all of mankind.
[02:30:23.340 --> 02:30:30.340]  And by the time they launched their attack in 2020, Alex Jones' InfoWars and our audience
[02:30:30.340 --> 02:30:35.340]  were there to warn the people of the deadly vaccines that we knew were coming.
[02:30:35.340 --> 02:30:37.340]  This is why they attack us.
[02:30:37.340 --> 02:30:40.340]  This is why we need your support.
[02:30:40.340 --> 02:30:44.340]  Because we tell the truth, Alex Jones was right.
[02:30:44.340 --> 02:30:50.340]  Join the resistance. Buy products. Donate to the cause. Share the links.
[02:30:50.340 --> 02:30:58.340]  Join us in the fight for freedom. And help us defeat the New World Order.
[02:30:58.340 --> 02:31:03.340]  Introducing our new incredible supplement line, InfoWars indeed.
[02:31:03.340 --> 02:31:07.340]  Now in 60 seconds, it's hard to tell you how incredible these products are.
[02:31:07.340 --> 02:31:12.340]  All of these products are already sold on store shelves under other brand names
[02:31:12.340 --> 02:31:15.340]  for up to twice the cost we're selling it to you.
[02:31:15.340 --> 02:31:18.340]  These are high-end. These are the very best.
[02:31:18.340 --> 02:31:20.340]  You know our body's ultimate turmeric formula is amazing?
[02:31:20.340 --> 02:31:26.340]  Well, guess what? We now have turmeric 95 that's basically the same formula for a lower price.
[02:31:26.340 --> 02:31:29.340]  CBD oil of the highest quality.
[02:31:29.340 --> 02:31:36.340]  Up to 50% less than major competitors selling the exact high-quality full-spectrum CBD.
[02:31:36.340 --> 02:31:41.340]  And it goes on for all the new InfoWars MD products at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:31:41.340 --> 02:31:48.340]  The highest quality directly from the manufacturer to your door at prices up to 50%
[02:31:48.340 --> 02:31:51.340]  in some cases 100% lower than what they're sold for in stores.
[02:31:51.340 --> 02:32:07.340]  InfoWars MD at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:32:22.340 --> 02:32:24.340]  What we've covered is coming true.
[02:32:24.340 --> 02:32:29.340]  But if they can convince you we've been shut down, if they can convince you that we're going away
[02:32:29.340 --> 02:32:33.340]  and you stop supporting, you stop spreading the word, then they do win.
[02:32:33.340 --> 02:32:37.340]  Ladies and gentlemen, there's only one group of people that can shut down InfoWars
[02:32:37.340 --> 02:32:39.340]  and that's you, the viewers and listeners.
[02:32:39.340 --> 02:32:41.340]  If you decide we're done, we're done.
[02:32:41.340 --> 02:32:45.340]  If you decide to go to InfoWarsStore.com and get supplements and books and films
[02:32:45.340 --> 02:32:48.340]  and t-shirts and so much more, we will stay on the air indefinitely.

[02:32:51.340 --> 02:32:56.340]  Stand up against the globalists, go to InfoWarsStore.com right now and keep us on air.
[02:32:56.340 --> 02:32:57.340]  It's up to you.
[02:32:59.340 --> 02:33:06.340]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:09.340 --> 02:33:14.340]  I've got a tiger by the tail that's playing the scene.
[02:33:14.340 --> 02:33:19.340]  I won't be much when you get through with me.
[02:33:19.340 --> 02:33:21.340]  He never gives up.
[02:33:21.340 --> 02:33:28.340]  He's Alex Jones, broadcasting from deep in the heart of Texas, worldwide.
[02:33:28.340 --> 02:33:30.340]  I've got a tiger by the tail that's playing the scene.
[02:33:30.340 --> 02:33:35.340]  Well, I thought the day I met you were me dazzling.
[02:33:35.340 --> 02:33:39.340]  Richard, your calls are just up next.
[02:33:39.340 --> 02:33:42.340]  Peter in Washington, thanks for calling, go ahead.
[02:33:42.340 --> 02:33:44.340]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:33:44.340 --> 02:33:47.340]  I think the thing is, it's like Clarice, first principles.
[02:33:47.340 --> 02:33:50.340]  Marcus Aurelius, what is this thing in and of itself?
[02:33:50.340 --> 02:33:52.340]  What is the thing in its constitution?
[02:33:52.340 --> 02:33:58.340]  What it is is mortal men of flesh and blood and the vax is about power.
[02:33:58.340 --> 02:34:01.340]  Secondarily, it's first about life extension.
[02:34:01.340 --> 02:34:07.340]  Trump met with Gates and all of a sudden he changed his mind about vaccines.
[02:34:07.340 --> 02:34:09.340]  What might he have been told?
[02:34:09.340 --> 02:34:14.340]  He said in his inaugural speech, we have the keys to life.
[02:34:14.340 --> 02:34:18.340]  I'm going to fast track stuff that heals cancer because they lied to him
[02:34:18.340 --> 02:34:20.340]  and said they had all the answers.
[02:34:20.340 --> 02:34:26.340]  And Jared has said we're either the first generation to live forever or the last to die.
[02:34:26.340 --> 02:34:28.340]  Jared has Trump's ear.
[02:34:28.340 --> 02:34:30.340]  He also has Elon's ear.
[02:34:30.340 --> 02:34:33.340]  He was in the box with Elon at the World Cup.
[02:34:33.340 --> 02:34:37.340]  So all three of them seek life extension.
[02:34:37.340 --> 02:34:42.340]  And the key about the power they seek is the power that they seek
[02:34:42.340 --> 02:34:46.340]  is to accelerate life extension technology research.
[02:34:46.340 --> 02:34:48.340]  That's what they want most.
[02:34:48.340 --> 02:34:50.340]  I 100% agree.
[02:34:50.340 --> 02:34:52.340]  My whole film in-game is about that.
[02:34:52.340 --> 02:34:53.340]  Right.
[02:34:53.340 --> 02:34:56.340]  And so the thing is, when you look at what they've done
[02:34:56.340 --> 02:35:01.340]  and you look at the vitriol that Elon came after you about, it was related to the vax.
[02:35:01.340 --> 02:35:07.340]  And a caller had used a quote about the Milstone and children.
[02:35:07.340 --> 02:35:12.340]  And I think because that implicated Trump, who I believe is a supporter of the vaccine,
[02:35:12.340 --> 02:35:16.340]  he got especially angry and said he would never replatform you.
[02:35:16.340 --> 02:35:21.340]  The transhumanism that they may believe in and the life extension technology they seek
[02:35:21.340 --> 02:35:25.340]  is the real fundamental thing and not power.
[02:35:25.340 --> 02:35:30.340]  Power is a means to an end and freedom blocks the speed at which they can get their life extension.
[02:35:30.340 --> 02:35:34.340]  Well, Jared Kushner said he's never going to die.
[02:35:34.340 --> 02:35:35.340]  Right.
[02:35:35.340 --> 02:35:41.340]  And he backed off of it later, but I think once an old person who has everything in the world
[02:35:41.340 --> 02:35:44.340]  hears, we can make you live longer.
[02:35:44.340 --> 02:35:46.340]  They're like, whatever it takes.
[02:35:46.340 --> 02:35:48.340]  But we've got to legalize this and get it out there.
[02:35:48.340 --> 02:35:51.340]  So why wouldn't they bring a less dangerous way out front?
[02:35:51.340 --> 02:35:56.340]  Why would they bring something out that discredits the mRNA right up front?
[02:35:56.340 --> 02:36:00.340]  I think, number one, they didn't realize the level of resistance they'd meet.
[02:36:00.340 --> 02:36:02.340]  And number two, they're in a hurry.
[02:36:02.340 --> 02:36:04.340]  The freedom slows down their research.
[02:36:04.340 --> 02:36:08.340]  If they have complete control over all of humanity, how long does research...
[02:36:08.340 --> 02:36:18.340]  Well, by the way, guys, cue up Benjamin Netanyahu on the Neocon King Ben Shapiro.
[02:36:18.340 --> 02:36:26.340]  Two months ago, it was on his platform, it was with Jordan Peterson.
[02:36:26.340 --> 02:36:28.340]  And he says, all of Israel's a guinea pig.
[02:36:28.340 --> 02:36:32.340]  We don't know if it would hurt him or help him, but we're going to test all the new drugs on Israelis
[02:36:32.340 --> 02:36:34.340]  and track all their genetics.
[02:36:34.340 --> 02:36:36.340]  And then we're going to find the keys to life through this.
[02:36:36.340 --> 02:36:44.340]  So they're saying we're going to sacrifice Israelis and make Israel the guinea pig testing center.
[02:36:44.340 --> 02:36:47.340]  He says it right there.
[02:36:47.340 --> 02:36:51.340]  And the thing is, it could be different flavors.
[02:36:51.340 --> 02:36:55.340]  It could be far more mellow and not wanting to kill everybody.
[02:36:55.340 --> 02:37:01.340]  But fundamentally, if you're going to make advances in technology quick enough to get a 70-something extra life,
[02:37:01.340 --> 02:37:05.340]  it's got to be fast and informed consent and sign on the dotted line.
[02:37:05.340 --> 02:37:07.340]  And do you realize the risks that this pose?
[02:37:07.340 --> 02:37:09.340]  People are not buying into that.
[02:37:09.340 --> 02:37:10.340]  No, that's it.
[02:37:10.340 --> 02:37:11.340]  That's it.
[02:37:11.340 --> 02:37:14.340]  I perfectly said, best caller of the day of amazing calls.
[02:37:14.340 --> 02:37:15.340]  Thank you, Peter.
[02:37:15.340 --> 02:37:16.340]  Damn right.
[02:37:16.340 --> 02:37:17.340]  Richard in New York.
[02:37:17.340 --> 02:37:18.340]  You're on the air.
[02:37:18.340 --> 02:37:19.340]  Go ahead.
[02:37:19.340 --> 02:37:20.340]  Hi, Alex.
[02:37:20.340 --> 02:37:21.340]  Can you hear me?
[02:37:21.340 --> 02:37:22.340]  I can, sir.
[02:37:22.340 --> 02:37:23.340]  Go ahead.
[02:37:23.340 --> 02:37:24.340]  You want to talk about the ultimate sin?
[02:37:24.340 --> 02:37:26.340]  It's unpardonable sin.
[02:37:26.340 --> 02:37:32.340]  This is Matthew chapter 12 verse 31.
[02:37:32.340 --> 02:37:38.340]  I say unto you, all manner of sin and blasphemy shall be forgiven them,
[02:37:38.340 --> 02:37:45.340]  but the blasphemy against the Holy Ghost shall not be forgiven unto men.
[02:37:45.340 --> 02:37:52.340]  Whosoever speaketh against the Holy Ghost, it shall not be forgiven him,
[02:37:52.340 --> 02:37:56.340]  either in this world or in the world to come.
[02:37:56.340 --> 02:37:58.340]  We're in the world to come.
[02:37:58.340 --> 02:38:00.340]  The Holy Ghost is a key player here.
[02:38:00.340 --> 02:38:03.340]  But who is the Holy Ghost?
[02:38:03.340 --> 02:38:04.340]  Okay, here's my last one.
[02:38:04.340 --> 02:38:05.340]  Let me ask your opinion.
[02:38:05.340 --> 02:38:07.340]  What is blasphemy against the Holy Ghost?
[02:38:07.340 --> 02:38:11.340]  That means the Holy Ghost comes to you and you reject it and say, I hate you.
[02:38:11.340 --> 02:38:12.340]  I don't want you.
[02:38:12.340 --> 02:38:14.340]  Is that the ultimate sin?
[02:38:14.340 --> 02:38:16.340]  Yeah, well, it's part of it.
[02:38:16.340 --> 02:38:21.340]  But if you fail to know who the Holy Ghost is, you've missed the boat.
[02:38:21.340 --> 02:38:28.340]  Okay, in revelations it says, and I shall send unto you another comforter who the world would not see.
[02:38:28.340 --> 02:38:30.340]  Neither would they recognize him.
[02:38:30.340 --> 02:38:39.340]  In Acts 1st chapter, you shall receive power after the Holy Ghost has fully come upon you.
[02:38:39.340 --> 02:38:41.340]  Who is the Holy Ghost?
[02:38:41.340 --> 02:38:43.340]  I'll get right to the point.
[02:38:43.340 --> 02:38:49.340]  The Holy Ghost is the reemergence of Michael the Archangel in form.
[02:38:49.340 --> 02:39:00.340]  He is the first of the two witnesses who appear, which uses, if you look at chapter 11 of Book of Revelation,
[02:39:00.340 --> 02:39:03.340]  it calls them the two golden candlesticks.
[02:39:03.340 --> 02:39:08.340]  Well, I would describe the Holy Ghost, and I think your right Archangel is bringing that,
[02:39:08.340 --> 02:39:11.340]  is the direct connection to God.
[02:39:11.340 --> 02:39:13.340]  Yes, and the Holy Ghost is...
[02:39:13.340 --> 02:39:14.340]  Wait a minute, Michael.
[02:39:14.340 --> 02:39:16.340]  I mean, wait a minute, Alex.
[02:39:16.340 --> 02:39:18.340]  The Holy Ghost has appeared.
[02:39:18.340 --> 02:39:20.340]  Has appeared.
[02:39:20.340 --> 02:39:23.340]  Okay, and everybody has denied it.
[02:39:23.340 --> 02:39:25.340]  They are not reading the instructions.
[02:39:25.340 --> 02:39:28.340]  When you get in trouble, read the instructions.
[02:39:28.340 --> 02:39:33.340]  And I will send unto you another comforter who the world will not see.
[02:39:33.340 --> 02:39:35.340]  Neither would they recognize him.
[02:39:35.340 --> 02:39:38.340]  But he is the Holy Ghost and the Spirit of Truth.
[02:39:38.340 --> 02:39:44.340]  That has actually happened, including the second witness.
[02:39:44.340 --> 02:39:52.340]  Okay, the first of the two witnesses is Michael the Archangel who did appear again in the United States,
[02:39:52.340 --> 02:39:54.340]  not in Israel.
[02:39:54.340 --> 02:39:57.340]  He appeared in the United States in the Rocky Mountains.
[02:39:57.340 --> 02:40:02.340]  Okay, and a little stone chapel on a mound of prairie grass.
[02:40:02.340 --> 02:40:07.340]  Would you like to hear his solution to this?
[02:40:07.340 --> 02:40:09.340]  Go ahead.
[02:40:09.340 --> 02:40:11.340]  Hello.
[02:40:11.340 --> 02:40:13.340]  Didn't cut you off.
[02:40:13.340 --> 02:40:14.340]  Okay.
[02:40:14.340 --> 02:40:19.340]  As we consider design cosmic forces which are possible over release in the earth,
[02:40:19.340 --> 02:40:22.340]  we know that if we were a sufficient number,
[02:40:22.340 --> 02:40:27.340]  144,000 in the earth, and we were fully trained in the way of Jesus Christ,
[02:40:27.340 --> 02:40:30.340]  and if all were properly placed in the world of man,
[02:40:30.340 --> 02:40:36.340]  it would be possible to release a cart of divine power in the earth so strong,
[02:40:36.340 --> 02:40:39.340]  and so all inclusive, that all who would do wickedly,
[02:40:39.340 --> 02:40:42.340]  and those who have chosen the way of evil,
[02:40:42.340 --> 02:40:44.340]  whoever and wherever they may be,
[02:40:44.340 --> 02:40:51.340]  would be almost instantly annihilated from the face of the earth in release of divine power.
[02:40:51.340 --> 02:40:56.340]  Those who were already dead to the reality of Jesus Christ would be killed.
[02:40:56.340 --> 02:41:01.340]  Such individuals would die far more and just as surely as if they were killed
[02:41:01.340 --> 02:41:04.340]  by any destructive methods known to man.
[02:41:04.340 --> 02:41:08.340]  Machine gun bullets could not be more effective.
[02:41:08.340 --> 02:41:16.340]  That is one of a little passage of 18 volumes created in the earth.
[02:41:16.340 --> 02:41:17.340]  Interesting call.
[02:41:17.340 --> 02:41:21.340]  I appreciate your call, and we got to go to other people, but I will tell you this.
[02:41:21.340 --> 02:41:23.340]  The Holy Ghost is God's connection to the people.
[02:41:23.340 --> 02:41:26.340]  When God moves against your heart to try to get you to reach out,
[02:41:26.340 --> 02:41:30.340]  and if you refuse that, it's really bad, and it's 100% real.
[02:41:30.340 --> 02:41:34.340]  The enemy has their transmission, God has his transmission,
[02:41:34.340 --> 02:41:36.340]  and that's why they're trying to block that.
[02:41:36.340 --> 02:41:37.340]  All right, listen.
[02:41:37.340 --> 02:41:40.340]  We got one more segment left before the guest host takes over,
[02:41:40.340 --> 02:41:43.340]  so I got to get to anonymous in Texas.
[02:41:43.340 --> 02:41:46.340]  I got to get to Marvin, Russell, Mark, and Jefferson,
[02:41:46.340 --> 02:41:50.340]  so I will take all five of your calls in the next 11-minute segment.
[02:41:50.340 --> 02:41:52.340]  When we come back, get ready.
[02:41:52.340 --> 02:41:54.340]  I want to thank you all for your support, incredible calls,
[02:41:54.340 --> 02:41:56.340]  so many angles, so many dimensions.
[02:41:56.340 --> 02:41:57.340]  I love taking calls.
[02:41:57.340 --> 02:42:00.340]  You know, as we've increased the calls, because I like the show,
[02:42:00.340 --> 02:42:02.340]  and I take calls, and I think you like it as well.
[02:42:02.340 --> 02:42:03.340]  I had some guests lined up.
[02:42:03.340 --> 02:42:04.340]  We canceled them.
[02:42:04.340 --> 02:42:08.340]  We'll be back, obviously, with the Thursday and the Friday broadcast as well.
[02:42:08.340 --> 02:42:11.340]  I forget who's in the fourth hour today.
[02:42:11.340 --> 02:42:12.340]  Let me look that up.
[02:42:12.340 --> 02:42:14.340]  That'll be host Kate Daly.
[02:42:14.340 --> 02:42:19.340]  Always does a really stupendous job, but we're going to go to break.
[02:42:19.340 --> 02:42:21.340]  I got a bunch of breaking news here, too,
[02:42:21.340 --> 02:42:24.340]  so I'll probably do the first five minutes before Kate Daly comes on,
[02:42:24.340 --> 02:42:27.340]  but I want to go right to your phone calls.
[02:42:27.340 --> 02:42:31.340]  But, man, we are living in such an insane time.
[02:42:31.340 --> 02:42:33.340]  There's a bunch of other articles I haven't gotten to here.
[02:42:33.340 --> 02:42:35.340]  Trudeau's censorship bill passes the Senate.
[02:42:35.340 --> 02:42:40.340]  That's in Canada, folks, where the government will monitor and censor you in live time.
[02:42:40.340 --> 02:42:41.340]  Charity isn't coming.
[02:42:41.340 --> 02:42:42.340]  It's here.
[02:42:42.340 --> 02:42:44.340]  And that's an incredible thing to admit.
[02:42:44.340 --> 02:42:49.340]  Band.video, infowars.com, and the new podcast show I'm doing,
[02:42:49.340 --> 02:42:54.340]  sign up for free to be sent emails about the live shows, is AlexShowsLive.com.

[02:44:01.340 --> 02:44:04.340]  We were supposed to be off the air months and months and months ago,
[02:44:04.340 --> 02:44:07.340]  mainstream media told you, but it's not true.
[02:44:07.340 --> 02:44:09.340]  They told you we were going to be shut down.
[02:44:09.340 --> 02:44:11.340]  They told you we owed a billion and a half dollars.
[02:44:11.340 --> 02:44:12.340]  None of that's true.
[02:44:12.340 --> 02:44:13.340]  It's all being appealed.
[02:44:13.340 --> 02:44:15.340]  They want you to think Infowars is dead,
[02:44:15.340 --> 02:44:18.340]  but if you simply stand up and support Infowars,
[02:44:18.340 --> 02:44:20.340]  we've got years and years of appeals,
[02:44:20.340 --> 02:44:22.340]  and we will not be taken off the air.
[02:44:22.340 --> 02:44:25.340]  But if they can convince you that we've been shut down, they're going to win.
[02:44:25.340 --> 02:44:28.340]  Don't let the globalist sigh up you and your family.

[02:44:35.340 --> 02:44:38.340]  and let the globalists know their sigh up has not worked.
[02:44:38.340 --> 02:44:40.340]  Thanks for keeping us on air.

[02:45:25.340 --> 02:45:29.340]  Imagine being like an Alex Jones or those guys have been away for like decades.
[02:45:29.340 --> 02:45:33.340]  Alex Jones called this years ago, years ago.
[02:45:33.340 --> 02:45:36.340]  Alex Jones never bought the Russia hoax, not for a second.
[02:45:36.340 --> 02:45:39.340]  You are one of the great thinkers of this.
[02:45:39.340 --> 02:45:42.340]  You are a martyr to the First Amendment.
[02:45:42.340 --> 02:45:45.340]  The government, ears, Alex Jones.
[02:45:45.340 --> 02:45:47.340]  That's why the globalists hate me,
[02:45:47.340 --> 02:45:50.340]  is because I'm exposing their corporate worldwide tyranny.
[02:45:50.340 --> 02:45:55.340]  AlexJonesLive.com

[02:46:26.340 --> 02:46:27.340]  because the owner is a listener,

[02:47:15.340 --> 02:47:17.340]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:47:17.340 --> 02:47:19.340]  Here's your phone calls.
[02:47:19.340 --> 02:47:22.340]  Anonymous in Texas. You're on the air. Go ahead.
[02:47:22.340 --> 02:47:24.340]  Alex, can you hear me?
[02:47:24.340 --> 02:47:26.340]  I can. Go ahead. You're on the air.
[02:47:26.340 --> 02:47:28.340]  Awesome. Oh my God. I love you so much.
[02:47:28.340 --> 02:47:29.340]  Love you too.
[02:47:29.340 --> 02:47:34.340]  I'm calling because everyone needs to know about this.
[02:47:34.340 --> 02:47:38.340]  The cyber attack is not imminent. It's here.
[02:47:38.340 --> 02:47:41.340]  I've been perpetually hacked for about two years.
[02:47:41.340 --> 02:47:44.340]  All of my Apple devices, no matter what,
[02:47:44.340 --> 02:47:46.340]  no matter how many times I've replaced them,
[02:47:46.340 --> 02:47:49.340]  they all contain spyware.
[02:47:49.340 --> 02:47:55.340]  The devices have a spyware, very much like Pegasus.
[02:47:55.340 --> 02:47:58.340]  I don't know if you've heard of it, the NSO program.
[02:47:58.340 --> 02:48:02.340]  And basically what happens is that people,
[02:48:02.340 --> 02:48:06.340]  I don't know who, are downloading my pictures,
[02:48:06.340 --> 02:48:09.340]  my conversation, taking snapshots.
[02:48:09.340 --> 02:48:11.340]  Well, everybody knows about this.
[02:48:11.340 --> 02:48:13.340]  I talked about it 20 years ago, but now they admit it.
[02:48:13.340 --> 02:48:16.340]  You'll be talking about the weirdest thing
[02:48:16.340 --> 02:48:18.340]  and then you'll get ads on your phone about it
[02:48:18.340 --> 02:48:20.340]  so that it's creating text messages.
[02:48:20.340 --> 02:48:22.340]  It's recording you and sending it back to a database.
[02:48:22.340 --> 02:48:24.340]  The apps do it. Governments do it.
[02:48:24.340 --> 02:48:26.340]  Yeah, it's just a free-for-all.
[02:48:26.340 --> 02:48:30.340]  Well, it's actually the product. Apple is complicit.
[02:48:30.340 --> 02:48:34.340]  So are the tall communications and internet providers.
[02:48:34.340 --> 02:48:37.340]  And, you know, the sad thing about this is that
[02:48:37.340 --> 02:48:40.340]  I've, like, reported it to a 10-passing office,
[02:48:40.340 --> 02:48:43.340]  the Texas Attorney General, local police and state police
[02:48:43.340 --> 02:48:48.340]  and the local police for, you know, complaining
[02:48:48.340 --> 02:48:52.340]  and reporting that I've been attacked, cyber-attacked,
[02:48:52.340 --> 02:48:54.340]  I got thrown in a mental hospital for a week
[02:48:54.340 --> 02:48:57.340]  on an emergency detention order.
[02:48:57.340 --> 02:49:00.340]  So, I mean, there are plans for people who have
[02:49:00.340 --> 02:49:05.340]  mental history, depression, any kind of mental history
[02:49:05.340 --> 02:49:09.340]  and have seen it in the World Bank's website
[02:49:09.340 --> 02:49:10.340]  that's going to happen.
[02:49:10.340 --> 02:49:12.340]  Sure, you're talking about the red flag laws
[02:49:12.340 --> 02:49:14.340]  where once you get flagged, they surveil you.
[02:49:14.340 --> 02:49:15.340]  I appreciate your call.
[02:49:15.340 --> 02:49:18.340]  Look, all I can tell you is that the internet
[02:49:18.340 --> 02:49:20.340]  is designed to control people.
[02:49:20.340 --> 02:49:21.340]  We've used it to reach out to people.
[02:49:21.340 --> 02:49:22.340]  The system doesn't like that.
[02:49:22.340 --> 02:49:24.340]  Marvin in Alabama, you're on the air.
[02:49:24.340 --> 02:49:26.340]  Marvin, go ahead.
[02:49:26.340 --> 02:49:28.340]  Hey, Alex, couple quick things.
[02:49:28.340 --> 02:49:31.340]  One, with the money and the grid shutting down,
[02:49:31.340 --> 02:49:35.340]  if that happens, we need to make it known loud and clear now
[02:49:35.340 --> 02:49:37.340]  and with as big of names as possible
[02:49:37.340 --> 02:49:39.340]  that when the power does come back on,
[02:49:39.340 --> 02:49:42.340]  everybody that has property in their possession,
[02:49:42.340 --> 02:49:44.340]  their house or whatever, it's theirs.
[02:49:44.340 --> 02:49:47.340]  I don't care if they owed a million dollars to the bank.
[02:49:47.340 --> 02:49:49.340]  If the bank wants to screw around like this
[02:49:49.340 --> 02:49:52.340]  and play around and wake up one day
[02:49:52.340 --> 02:49:54.340]  and have CBDCs or whatever.
[02:49:54.340 --> 02:49:55.340]  No, you're right.
[02:49:55.340 --> 02:49:58.340]  We should not comply when they shut the system down
[02:49:58.340 --> 02:49:59.340]  and offer a new system.
[02:49:59.340 --> 02:50:01.340]  We should not go along with it.
[02:50:01.340 --> 02:50:02.340]  Right.
[02:50:02.340 --> 02:50:04.340]  At that point, self-defense is authorized
[02:50:04.340 --> 02:50:06.340]  and we have to help defend our neighbors.
[02:50:06.340 --> 02:50:08.340]  As far as the vaccine and Trump,
[02:50:08.340 --> 02:50:11.340]  this mental gymnastics that's out there
[02:50:11.340 --> 02:50:14.340]  that he had to do it to get things open back up.
[02:50:14.340 --> 02:50:17.340]  I mean, if people would just think this through for a minute,
[02:50:17.340 --> 02:50:19.340]  it's part of the strong delusion.
[02:50:19.340 --> 02:50:20.340]  Anybody that believes that,
[02:50:20.340 --> 02:50:22.340]  they've bought into the strong delusion
[02:50:22.340 --> 02:50:25.340]  because that's like saying like Nancy Pelosi,
[02:50:25.340 --> 02:50:27.340]  we have to pass the bill to read the bill.
[02:50:27.340 --> 02:50:29.340]  And so we have to kill people
[02:50:29.340 --> 02:50:32.340]  and lots and like 250 million people
[02:50:32.340 --> 02:50:34.340]  in order to not kill people with the lockdowns.
[02:50:34.340 --> 02:50:35.340]  I mean, it's just absurd.
[02:50:35.340 --> 02:50:37.340]  I don't know what people are thinking.
[02:50:37.340 --> 02:50:41.340]  Plus, you can't really go with what he's saying anyways
[02:50:41.340 --> 02:50:44.340]  because he's now saying that he wasn't for the lockdowns
[02:50:44.340 --> 02:50:47.340]  when he chastised the Georgia governor,
[02:50:47.340 --> 02:50:50.340]  when he chastised Sweden for opening back up,
[02:50:50.340 --> 02:50:53.340]  when he said that Nancy needed to be thrown out
[02:50:53.340 --> 02:50:56.340]  of the Republican Party for making Congress come into vote
[02:50:56.340 --> 02:50:58.340]  actually in person.
[02:50:58.340 --> 02:51:00.340]  So he's rewriting history now.
[02:51:00.340 --> 02:51:01.340]  You just can't trust that.
[02:51:01.340 --> 02:51:03.340]  And the real sin of it all
[02:51:03.340 --> 02:51:06.340]  is complying with the papers, please.
[02:51:06.340 --> 02:51:08.340]  The people, I heard your call earlier,
[02:51:08.340 --> 02:51:10.340]  they got the shot that said, you know, sadly,
[02:51:10.340 --> 02:51:11.340]  so he could travel.
[02:51:11.340 --> 02:51:13.340]  That's way worse than just getting the shot
[02:51:13.340 --> 02:51:16.340]  because now him getting the shot is sad
[02:51:16.340 --> 02:51:18.340]  and I hope he's okay, but it doesn't affect me.
[02:51:18.340 --> 02:51:21.340]  But him showing his papers to travel,
[02:51:21.340 --> 02:51:22.340]  that affects me.
[02:51:22.340 --> 02:51:24.340]  And that's really the sin in all of this
[02:51:24.340 --> 02:51:27.340]  is when people comply and they show their papers.
[02:51:27.340 --> 02:51:28.340]  Sure, then sets the precedent
[02:51:28.340 --> 02:51:30.340]  and you get deeper into the trap.
[02:51:30.340 --> 02:51:32.340]  You don't get more freedom by complying.
[02:51:32.340 --> 02:51:33.340]  You're not criticizing him.
[02:51:33.340 --> 02:51:34.340]  He's learned.
[02:51:34.340 --> 02:51:36.340]  You get more freedom by not complying.
[02:51:36.340 --> 02:51:37.340]  Thank you so much.
[02:51:37.340 --> 02:51:40.340]  Jefferson in Virginia, you're on the air.
[02:51:40.340 --> 02:51:41.340]  Hey, Alex.
[02:51:41.340 --> 02:51:42.340]  Yes, sir.
[02:51:42.340 --> 02:51:44.340]  I would be accused of being
[02:51:44.340 --> 02:51:47.340]  one of the strong delusion people, I guess.
[02:51:47.340 --> 02:51:50.340]  2021 without the vaccine was supposed to be
[02:51:50.340 --> 02:51:52.340]  a kill zone for Remdesivir.
[02:51:52.340 --> 02:51:55.340]  Trump with war speed brought out the vaccine
[02:51:55.340 --> 02:51:56.340]  ahead of schedule.
[02:51:56.340 --> 02:51:58.340]  If you read the spars document,
[02:51:58.340 --> 02:52:00.340]  Kolasivir was supposed to be.
[02:52:00.340 --> 02:52:04.340]  Well, Fauci did that with AZT and HIV and AIDS.
[02:52:04.340 --> 02:52:06.340]  He killed millions with that.
[02:52:06.340 --> 02:52:08.340]  I mean, I get what was going on.
[02:52:08.340 --> 02:52:11.340]  I get they told Trump, bring this out, it'll save people.
[02:52:11.340 --> 02:52:13.340]  But I mean, still, Trump now knows all this.
[02:52:13.340 --> 02:52:16.340]  He should come out against it.
[02:52:16.340 --> 02:52:17.340]  I think he will.
[02:52:17.340 --> 02:52:19.340]  But the point is what I'm saying is he saved
[02:52:19.340 --> 02:52:21.340]  4 million older Americans from getting killed
[02:52:21.340 --> 02:52:24.340]  with Remdesivir in 2021 because they were vaccinated.
[02:52:24.340 --> 02:52:26.340]  So when they got sick anyway,
[02:52:26.340 --> 02:52:28.340]  the hospitals couldn't kill the people
[02:52:28.340 --> 02:52:29.340]  who were vaccinated with Remdesivir
[02:52:29.340 --> 02:52:31.340]  because that would have made the whole vaccine
[02:52:31.340 --> 02:52:33.340]  not work at all.
[02:52:33.340 --> 02:52:36.340]  So they gave different medical treatment to people
[02:52:36.340 --> 02:52:38.340]  that were vaccinated compared to people that were
[02:52:38.340 --> 02:52:40.340]  unvaccinated because the vaccine came out early.
[02:52:40.340 --> 02:52:42.340]  So that messed up their plan.
[02:52:42.340 --> 02:52:45.340]  They wanted us to get to Christmas of 2021.
[02:52:45.340 --> 02:52:47.340]  And then they'd come out with the vaccine
[02:52:47.340 --> 02:52:49.340]  and then with our pent up demand because we're
[02:52:49.340 --> 02:52:51.340]  in a panic because 4 million Americans died.
[02:52:51.340 --> 02:52:53.340]  And then say that the virus killed people
[02:52:53.340 --> 02:52:54.340]  when it was really Remdesivir.
[02:52:54.340 --> 02:52:55.340]  Correct.
[02:52:55.340 --> 02:52:57.340]  That was the plan.
[02:52:57.340 --> 02:52:59.340]  And he messed that up for them.
[02:52:59.340 --> 02:53:01.340]  So he actually did save Americans.
[02:53:01.340 --> 02:53:03.340]  And I'm sure he thought there was probably an antidote
[02:53:03.340 --> 02:53:06.340]  to the vaccine if it was bad for people.
[02:53:06.340 --> 02:53:08.340]  So he was playing it the best he could.
[02:53:08.340 --> 02:53:10.340]  He didn't want to be taken out of office,
[02:53:10.340 --> 02:53:12.340]  but he figured if they take me out,
[02:53:12.340 --> 02:53:14.340]  at least I'll keep 4 million Americans
[02:53:14.340 --> 02:53:16.340]  from getting killed with Remdesivir
[02:53:16.340 --> 02:53:17.340]  because half the population...
[02:53:17.340 --> 02:53:19.340]  Well, look, I mean, I think it's open for debate.
[02:53:19.340 --> 02:53:23.340]  But people only obsessing on Trump is a diversion.
[02:53:23.340 --> 02:53:25.340]  The globalists definitely don't like Trump.
[02:53:25.340 --> 02:53:27.340]  They actually try to be president.
[02:53:27.340 --> 02:53:29.340]  We got to worry about what they're up to.
[02:53:29.340 --> 02:53:32.340]  At the same time, push Trump to tell the truth about the shot,
[02:53:32.340 --> 02:53:34.340]  which he's starting to do.
[02:53:34.340 --> 02:53:36.340]  Yeah, it's coming around.
[02:53:36.340 --> 02:53:37.340]  It'll work out all right.
[02:53:37.340 --> 02:53:39.340]  We just have a good time.
[02:53:39.340 --> 02:53:40.340]  Thanks for the call, Jefferson.
[02:53:40.340 --> 02:53:42.340]  Russell in California, last caller.
[02:53:42.340 --> 02:53:43.340]  You're on the air.
[02:53:43.340 --> 02:53:44.340]  Hi, Alex.
[02:53:44.340 --> 02:53:46.340]  Thank you for taking my call.
[02:53:46.340 --> 02:53:47.340]  Thank you.
[02:53:47.340 --> 02:53:50.340]  I'm going to let some cats out of the bag here.
[02:53:50.340 --> 02:53:54.340]  The Chinese fly balloon, according to my aerospace type,
[02:53:54.340 --> 02:53:59.340]  I got some people in low and high places.
[02:53:59.340 --> 02:54:06.340]  We suspect that the Chinese were doing what's known as Turcom radar.
[02:54:06.340 --> 02:54:12.340]  In other words, they are mapping the United States from Alaska
[02:54:12.340 --> 02:54:16.340]  and across the United States with what's known as Turcom radar.
[02:54:16.340 --> 02:54:19.340]  When you pop an EMP device,
[02:54:19.340 --> 02:54:25.340]  you're going to take out a large portion of the infrastructure electricity.
[02:54:25.340 --> 02:54:30.340]  GPS satellites will have to be taken out in a combat situation.
[02:54:30.340 --> 02:54:35.340]  So once GPS is gone, you're grounding off light.
[02:54:35.340 --> 02:54:41.340]  Today's missiles use both GPS and what's known as Turcom radar,
[02:54:41.340 --> 02:54:45.340]  especially cruise missiles.
[02:54:45.340 --> 02:54:51.340]  These cruise, the Soviets and the Chinese are about 10 years behind us.
[02:54:51.340 --> 02:54:54.340]  And with their subsonic missiles,
[02:54:54.340 --> 02:55:09.340]  they need the old school Turcom radar capability to hit target after a GMP attack.
[02:55:09.340 --> 02:55:16.340]  And you can't do ground reading radar from space?
[02:55:16.340 --> 02:55:19.340]  No, no, because what you want to do,
[02:55:19.340 --> 02:55:24.340]  and that was the reason why this balloon was at the altitude it was,
[02:55:24.340 --> 02:55:30.340]  it can take a better picture of terrain.
[02:55:30.340 --> 02:55:33.340]  Sure, instead of shooting through thicker atmosphere.
[02:55:33.340 --> 02:55:35.340]  Right, exactly.
[02:55:35.340 --> 02:55:41.340]  Landmarks, and if it had a Turcom capability for it,
[02:55:41.340 --> 02:55:45.340]  it could also see through vegetation, trees.
[02:55:45.340 --> 02:55:50.340]  It could probably, this thing probably mapped, could map the,
[02:55:50.340 --> 02:55:54.340]  we have systems that I know of in existence,
[02:55:54.340 --> 02:56:01.340]  that can map how many inches it is from the edge of the street to your front door.
[02:56:01.340 --> 02:56:06.340]  So, that being said, what the Chinese were doing,
[02:56:06.340 --> 02:56:09.340]  and I think Biden, I think Biden needs to be impeached,
[02:56:09.340 --> 02:56:13.340]  because we will never find out the true meaning of this balloon,
[02:56:13.340 --> 02:56:17.340]  and why these balloons are being sent and so forth.
[02:56:17.340 --> 02:56:20.340]  I think it's the benefit the Chinese and the Russians, they are...
[02:56:20.340 --> 02:56:22.340]  I think your call makes a lot of sense,
[02:56:22.340 --> 02:56:24.340]  and why would General Milley not tell Trump,
[02:56:24.340 --> 02:56:27.340]  this is a gigantic balloon with a gigantic array.
[02:56:27.340 --> 02:56:31.340]  I know about ground radar, topography mapping radar,
[02:56:31.340 --> 02:56:33.340]  and so I know a little bit about what you're talking about.
[02:56:33.340 --> 02:56:36.340]  It sounds very credible to me. I appreciate your call.
[02:56:36.340 --> 02:56:38.340]  All right, we're going to go to break.
[02:56:38.340 --> 02:56:40.340]  We have a very important Gregory's report coming up,
[02:56:40.340 --> 02:56:44.340]  and then we're going to have Kate Dolly take over.
[02:56:44.340 --> 02:56:46.340]  I'll be back tomorrow, 11 a.m. Central.
[02:56:46.340 --> 02:56:48.340]  Harrison Smith is 8 a.m. Central.
[02:56:48.340 --> 02:56:49.340]  The American Journal.
[02:56:49.340 --> 02:56:52.340]  Owen Shroyer is in about an hour and five minutes
[02:56:52.340 --> 02:56:55.340]  with the War Room 3 p.m. Central Standard Time.
[02:56:55.340 --> 02:56:57.340]  That is coming up.
[02:56:57.340 --> 02:57:00.340]  This is a really powerful report.
[02:57:00.340 --> 02:57:02.340]  The Fed needs another 9-11,
[02:57:02.340 --> 02:57:04.340]  and then I air it at the start of the show.
[02:57:04.340 --> 02:57:07.340]  Hope everybody shares it at Band Out Video and infowars.com
[02:57:07.340 --> 02:57:10.340]  forward slash show, but whatever you do,
[02:57:10.340 --> 02:57:12.340]  watch this report because he's dead right.
[02:57:12.340 --> 02:57:14.340]  The deep state needs a big crisis
[02:57:14.340 --> 02:57:16.340]  to get themselves out of the trouble they're in.
[02:57:16.340 --> 02:57:19.340]  The question is, what will that big event be?
[02:57:19.340 --> 02:57:21.340]  I want to thank you all for your word of mouth,
[02:57:21.340 --> 02:57:22.340]  your prayer keepings on air.
[02:57:22.340 --> 02:57:24.340]  Without you, we're not going to be here.
[02:57:24.340 --> 02:57:25.340]  If you've heard of this, I salute you.
[02:57:25.340 --> 02:57:27.340]  If you haven't supported, please get Ray Price
[02:57:27.340 --> 02:57:30.340]  at the same time while you support infowars.com.
[02:57:30.340 --> 02:57:32.340]  All right, great job of the crew.
[02:57:32.340 --> 02:57:35.340]  Hour number four, kicked off with Greg Rees
[02:57:35.340 --> 02:57:37.340]  and the deep state needing a new 9-11,
[02:57:37.340 --> 02:57:39.340]  and then Kate Dolly.
[02:57:39.340 --> 02:57:41.340]  We'll be right back with hour number four.
[02:57:49.340 --> 02:57:51.340]  I talk a lot about the great successes
[02:57:51.340 --> 02:57:54.340]  that infowars has had. I don't think anybody can deny it.
[02:57:54.340 --> 02:57:58.340]  And it is because of listeners and viewers supporting us.
[02:57:58.340 --> 02:58:00.340]  When we talk about the crew at infowars,
[02:58:00.340 --> 02:58:03.340]  people behind the scenes, the researchers, the writers,
[02:58:03.340 --> 02:58:07.340]  they really have been the MVPs in this fight.
[02:58:07.340 --> 02:58:09.340]  And we look at Harrison Smith and Owen Schreuer
[02:58:09.340 --> 02:58:12.340]  and the hard work they engage in every day,
[02:58:12.340 --> 02:58:14.340]  five, six, seven days a week.
[02:58:14.340 --> 02:58:16.340]  It's really just incredible.
[02:58:16.340 --> 02:58:18.340]  So for myself and the whole infowars crew,
[02:58:18.340 --> 02:58:20.340]  I thank you for your past support.
[02:58:20.340 --> 02:58:22.340]  And I encourage you now to realize
[02:58:22.340 --> 02:58:25.340]  that infowars cannot stay on air if you do not support us.
[02:58:25.340 --> 02:58:27.340]  I know you spread the word, I know you pray for us,
[02:58:27.340 --> 02:58:29.340]  and that's wonderful, keep doing it.
[02:58:29.340 --> 02:58:32.340]  But most viewers and listeners never go to infowars.com
[02:58:32.340 --> 02:58:35.340]  and you never buy great products that enrich and empower your life
[02:58:35.340 --> 02:58:37.340]  all at the same time, keep us on air.
[02:58:37.340 --> 02:58:39.340]  I know that less than 1% of our listeners
[02:58:39.340 --> 02:58:41.340]  actually go buy products at infowars.com.
[02:58:41.340 --> 02:58:45.340]  If just 1% more of you took action at went to infowars.com,
[02:58:45.340 --> 02:58:48.340]  our fighting problems will be over. Please take action now.

[02:59:41.340 --> 02:59:44.340]  Here's our new infowarsmd incredible line.
[02:59:51.340 --> 02:59:55.340]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[03:00:04.340 --> 03:00:09.340]  Why would anyone think that our corrupt government sees communist China as an enemy?
[03:00:09.340 --> 03:00:13.340]  They have been close partners for over 50 years.
[03:00:13.340 --> 03:00:19.340]  In 1971, after Mao Zedong spent years calling for the invasion of America,
[03:00:19.340 --> 03:00:23.340]  Henry Kissinger, acting as President Nixon's special representative,
[03:00:23.340 --> 03:00:28.340]  secretly traveled to Beijing to open business relations with the CCP.
[03:00:28.340 --> 03:00:34.340]  George H.W. Bush then went to China as the director of the U.S. liaison office
[03:00:34.340 --> 03:00:40.340]  and paved the way for multinational outsourcing of America's labor markets.
[03:00:40.340 --> 03:00:45.340]  Fast forward to 2001, the inside job of taking down the Twin Towers
[03:00:45.340 --> 03:00:49.340]  accomplished many things for the corrupt U.S. government.
[03:00:49.340 --> 03:00:54.340]  It was the Pearl Harbor event that the neocons wrote they needed
[03:00:54.340 --> 03:00:57.340]  to launch their plan for a new American Century.
[03:00:57.340 --> 03:01:01.340]  It was the catalyst for the Patriot Act, which is being used today
[03:01:01.340 --> 03:01:07.340]  to target American Patriots. And it was a way to account for trillions of missing dollars.
[03:01:07.340 --> 03:01:13.340]  On the afternoon of September 10th, 2001, U.S. Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld
[03:01:13.340 --> 03:01:19.340]  announced that the Pentagon was unable to account for $2.3 trillion.
[03:01:19.340 --> 03:01:25.340]  The technology revolution has transformed organizations across the private sector.
[03:01:25.340 --> 03:01:29.340]  But not ours, not fully, not yet.
[03:01:29.340 --> 03:01:34.340]  We are, as they say, tangled in our anchor chain.
[03:01:34.340 --> 03:01:37.340]  Our financial systems are decades old.
[03:01:37.340 --> 03:01:43.340]  According to some estimates, we cannot track $2.3 trillion in transactions.
[03:01:43.340 --> 03:01:50.340]  The very next day, on 9-11, the Pentagon's budget offices took a direct hit and was destroyed.
[03:01:50.340 --> 03:01:55.340]  The markets closed for two weeks, banks all across the nation were closed,
[03:01:55.340 --> 03:01:59.340]  and the missing $2.3 trillion was forgotten.
[03:01:59.340 --> 03:02:05.340]  With overwhelming evidence of 9-11 being a series of controlled demolitions,
[03:02:05.340 --> 03:02:09.340]  the debris and wreckage from the felled towers was not investigated.
[03:02:09.340 --> 03:02:13.340]  Instead, it was immediately shipped off to China.
[03:02:13.340 --> 03:02:19.340]  And on December 11th of that same year, China became a member of the World Trade Organization.
[03:02:19.340 --> 03:02:22.340]  Having been given favorable trading status by the U.S.,
[03:02:22.340 --> 03:02:27.340]  the CCP was virtually exempt from violating human rights violations.
[03:02:27.340 --> 03:02:36.340]  And millions of Americans began losing their jobs as manufacturing was outsourced to CCP slave labor factories.
[03:02:36.340 --> 03:02:38.340]  Fast forward to the current era.
[03:02:38.340 --> 03:02:43.340]  Our government worked with the Communist Chinese to weaponize COVID-19
[03:02:43.340 --> 03:02:48.340]  and to further destabilize the American economy with forced lockdowns
[03:02:48.340 --> 03:02:55.340]  and deadly experimental vaccines that are still killing people to this day, including children.
[03:02:55.340 --> 03:03:01.340]  The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics desperately publishes a fake jobs report,
[03:03:01.340 --> 03:03:07.340]  claiming over 500,000 jobs when the actual numbers are more like 80,000.
[03:03:07.340 --> 03:03:09.340]  The housing market is collapsing.
[03:03:09.340 --> 03:03:13.340]  41% of small businesses can't pay their rent.
[03:03:13.340 --> 03:03:16.340]  The U.S. debt is at $31 trillion.
[03:03:16.340 --> 03:03:24.340]  The Federal Reserve Bank is backed into a corner, and the crooked U.S. government needs another 9-11.
[03:03:24.340 --> 03:03:32.340]  And right on cue, a giant balloon, big enough to be seen by all, slowly creeps across the American skies.
[03:03:32.340 --> 03:03:36.340]  The average American is now talking about EMPs.
[03:03:36.340 --> 03:03:42.340]  Our government's partner, the CCP, takes credit, and a new bin Laden is born.
[03:03:42.340 --> 03:03:48.340]  The stage is now set for an EMP attack so that the banks have an excuse to close,
[03:03:48.340 --> 03:03:56.340]  steal the rest of America's wealth, making way for the CCP's digital wand to become the new World Reserve currency.
[03:03:56.340 --> 03:03:58.340]  They are probing us everywhere, Martha.
[03:03:58.340 --> 03:04:01.340]  They're probing us in the Pacific with their fighter aircraft.
[03:04:01.340 --> 03:04:03.340]  We had a close incident not too many weeks ago.
[03:04:03.340 --> 03:04:08.340]  They're probing us in our home by putting propaganda on TikToks, poisoning our children.
[03:04:08.340 --> 03:04:10.340]  They're working in our schools and universities.
[03:04:10.340 --> 03:04:14.340]  This is just another example of the Chinese Communist Party's aggression.
[03:04:14.340 --> 03:04:19.340]  Why would anyone think that our government is enemies with the Communist Chinese?
[03:04:19.340 --> 03:04:46.340]  Reporting for Infowars, this is Greg Rees.
[03:04:46.340 --> 03:05:03.340]  If you go to onlinehealthnow.com, connect with trusted and unbiased doctors at the wellness company.
[03:05:03.340 --> 03:05:07.340]  And I tell you, I'm honored to be the Chief Scientific Officer of the company.
[03:05:07.340 --> 03:05:12.340]  I contribute with like so many else do there, so many wonderful doctors.
[03:05:12.340 --> 03:05:19.340]  Far and away, the most popular product is Dr. Vandewater's detoxification supplement that features natokinase.
[03:05:19.340 --> 03:05:21.340]  It's a natural proteolytic enzyme.
[03:05:21.340 --> 03:05:27.340]  This one is the only enzyme that we're aware of right now that dissolves the spike protein.
[03:05:27.340 --> 03:05:28.340]  This is very important.
[03:05:28.340 --> 03:05:33.340]  The spike protein is loaded in the body with the COVID-19 infection and definitely with the vaccines.
[03:05:33.340 --> 03:05:35.340]  People are lower with the spike protein. They don't feel well.
[03:05:35.340 --> 03:05:37.340]  This is a potential solution.
[03:05:37.340 --> 03:05:40.340]  Hydroxychloroquine comes from a natural substance.
[03:05:40.340 --> 03:05:43.340]  So does ivermectin and now natokinase.
[03:05:43.340 --> 03:05:44.340]  Isn't it interesting?
[03:05:44.340 --> 03:05:50.340]  Natural substances, in a sense, combating this man-made disaster, SARS-CoV-2 in the vaccines.
[03:05:50.340 --> 03:05:53.340]  Onlinehealthnow.com, thank you for your support.
[03:05:53.340 --> 03:05:55.340]  And thank you for getting into that because it's important.
[03:05:55.340 --> 03:06:01.340]  You didn't come here to do that, but I made you do it.
[03:06:01.340 --> 03:06:03.340]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:06:03.340 --> 03:06:05.340]  I'm Kate Daly, your guest host from KateDalyRadio.com.
[03:06:05.340 --> 03:06:08.340]  So glad you're joining me in this last hour.
[03:06:08.340 --> 03:06:13.340]  Tackling some great subjects today, I have some information for you on the so-called Chinese balloon.
[03:06:13.340 --> 03:06:15.340]  And I'll tackle that in a few minutes.
[03:06:15.340 --> 03:06:20.340]  My first or my guest today for these first few segments will be Dr. Simone Gold.
[03:06:20.340 --> 03:06:29.340]  She's founder of the American Frontline Doctors, also targeted and incarcerated for merely giving a speech on January 6th as an invited guest.
[03:06:29.340 --> 03:06:34.340]  And of course, you know, Dr. Simone Gold, if you're unaware, been living in a cave.
[03:06:34.340 --> 03:06:40.340]  She is an MD, she is a JD, she's a licensed emergency physician and attorney visionary
[03:06:40.340 --> 03:06:47.340]  who led the pivotal, pivotal press conference event that broke the spell of coronavirus panic in 2020.
[03:06:47.340 --> 03:06:51.340]  Thank goodness, and created the most viral moment in modern media history.
[03:06:51.340 --> 03:06:55.340]  She became the founder of America's Frontline Doctors, the AFLDS,
[03:06:55.340 --> 03:06:59.340]  and now leads the nationwide movement to drain the science swamp.
[03:06:59.340 --> 03:07:01.340]  And I'm so happy to have her on the show.
[03:07:01.340 --> 03:07:06.340]  Dr. Gold, I know many out there are wondering about the government incarcerating you,
[03:07:06.340 --> 03:07:12.340]  actually incarcerating you in a maximum prison for giving a speech on healthcare in January 6th,
[03:07:12.340 --> 03:07:14.340]  and you were demonized and fraudulently charged.
[03:07:14.340 --> 03:07:16.340]  Many are wondering about your experience.
[03:07:16.340 --> 03:07:22.340]  Would you speak to that before we get to the very, very important lawsuit that we need to discuss,
[03:07:22.340 --> 03:07:25.340]  but tell everybody about your experience? They need to hear.
[03:07:25.340 --> 03:07:28.340]  Yes, you know, it was very, thank you.
[03:07:28.340 --> 03:07:32.340]  It was very shocking when the judge sentenced me to 60 days' incarceration,
[03:07:32.340 --> 03:07:36.340]  and it was even more shocking when the Bureau of Prison then sent me to FTC Miami,
[03:07:36.340 --> 03:07:45.340]  which is a maximum security facility, not at all matching the conviction or the plea agreement
[03:07:45.340 --> 03:07:47.340]  for a misdemeanor trespass.
[03:07:47.340 --> 03:07:52.340]  I want to remind everybody that I've never heard of anybody going to prison for a misdemeanor,
[03:07:52.340 --> 03:07:54.340]  let alone a maximum security facility.
[03:07:54.340 --> 03:07:56.340]  I was very scared when I went.
[03:07:56.340 --> 03:08:01.340]  I'm not going to lie. It was a pretty intimidating environment in which a doctor, lawyer, mom,
[03:08:01.340 --> 03:08:03.340]  middle-aged could find herself.
[03:08:03.340 --> 03:08:10.340]  But, you know, when I arrived there, they put me in isolation, which was horrific.
[03:08:10.340 --> 03:08:12.340]  That's what they did to the women. They didn't do that to the men.
[03:08:12.340 --> 03:08:15.340]  They did that ostensibly for COVID policies, but it was nonsense,
[03:08:15.340 --> 03:08:18.340]  because they just didn't want to open up a ward for COVID.
[03:08:18.340 --> 03:08:21.340]  They just put their women in isolation. It was really terrible.
[03:08:21.340 --> 03:08:23.340]  Six by 10 cell, I spent eight days there.
[03:08:23.340 --> 03:08:27.340]  Then general population with people that were really high security risk,
[03:08:27.340 --> 03:08:31.340]  medium security risk, and low security risk like myself.
[03:08:31.340 --> 03:08:35.340]  And it was tough. It was tough.
[03:08:35.340 --> 03:08:41.340]  I can only imagine. I can't imagine how terrifying that would be. Just terrifying.
[03:08:41.340 --> 03:08:43.340]  Yeah, you know, it was tough.
[03:08:43.340 --> 03:08:48.340]  I mean, I'm a very busy person, and so in the back of my mind was always work and things I had to do with work.
[03:08:48.340 --> 03:08:51.340]  But when you're in there, you know, time kind of grinds to a halt,
[03:08:51.340 --> 03:08:54.340]  and it's really nothing to do. There was no programming.
[03:08:54.340 --> 03:08:57.340]  You just really did nothing all day.
[03:08:57.340 --> 03:09:00.340]  I spent my time trying to read, and also I interviewed a lot of the women.
[03:09:00.340 --> 03:09:04.340]  It was an experience to be in such close proximity with women that were so different than myself.
[03:09:04.340 --> 03:09:06.340]  I got a lot of their stories.
[03:09:06.340 --> 03:09:09.340]  Through their stories, you can understand the failings of our criminal justice system,
[03:09:09.340 --> 03:09:12.340]  and I hope to one day put that in all book and bring that to light,
[03:09:12.340 --> 03:09:15.340]  because you can see politically conservative people really need to wake up
[03:09:15.340 --> 03:09:17.340]  to what's going on in our criminal justice system.
[03:09:17.340 --> 03:09:21.340]  At least on the women's side, there was a lot of people that really should not be held in prison,
[03:09:21.340 --> 03:09:25.340]  and our government just puts them in for a decade and throws away the key, and it's really not appropriate.
[03:09:25.340 --> 03:09:28.340]  Those stories are fascinating, and I will bring them to light one day.
[03:09:28.340 --> 03:09:31.340]  I'm so glad to hear that. Thank you for that.
[03:09:31.340 --> 03:09:35.340]  You have a new website called goldcare.com. I really hope people check it out.
[03:09:35.340 --> 03:09:39.340]  Without Dr. Gold's efforts, I would most likely be a widow today,
[03:09:39.340 --> 03:09:44.340]  so I owe a lot to her in the way of waking so many people up
[03:09:44.340 --> 03:09:48.340]  and making sure that they got the right protocols to save their loved ones from the hospital,
[03:09:48.340 --> 03:09:53.340]  the socialized medicine hospital situation that was going on and is going on today.
[03:09:53.340 --> 03:09:58.340]  Let's talk about what's going on with the doctors, especially in California,
[03:09:58.340 --> 03:10:02.340]  these new scary, scary things that are happening.
[03:10:02.340 --> 03:10:05.340]  Will you please let everybody know about those?
[03:10:05.340 --> 03:10:07.340]  Oh, my gosh. You're right. You hit the nail on the head.
[03:10:07.340 --> 03:10:09.340]  We have socialized medicine in this country.
[03:10:09.340 --> 03:10:13.340]  Even if you've got private insurance, all policies are set by Medicare and the government,
[03:10:13.340 --> 03:10:17.340]  and your downstream private insurance really follows those policies.
[03:10:17.340 --> 03:10:24.340]  More importantly than even that is that we simply have large influential stakeholders,
[03:10:24.340 --> 03:10:28.340]  like large hospital groups, for example, that are following government edicts,
[03:10:28.340 --> 03:10:31.340]  to then do what the government wants.
[03:10:31.340 --> 03:10:33.340]  We saw this in the era of COVID.
[03:10:33.340 --> 03:10:40.340]  We saw the government say, do XYZ policy, and if you comply with XYZ policy,
[03:10:40.340 --> 03:10:44.340]  you'll get extra money. That's what we saw in 2020, 2021.
[03:10:44.340 --> 03:10:51.340]  It was very blatant that the doctor-patient relationship was really unimportant
[03:10:51.340 --> 03:10:55.340]  compared to the employee-doctor relationship.
[03:10:55.340 --> 03:10:58.340]  The corporate hospital employer was listening to the government,
[03:10:58.340 --> 03:11:02.340]  getting money from the government to not put the patient's interest first.
[03:11:02.340 --> 03:11:04.340]  This was very tragic. This is what we saw.
[03:11:04.340 --> 03:11:12.340]  The bigger concern for this is that all of our healthcare costs amount to about 20% of our economy.
[03:11:12.340 --> 03:11:17.340]  If we're allowing 20% of our economy to be essentially socialized anyway,
[03:11:17.340 --> 03:11:19.340]  for me, this is a national security risk.
[03:11:19.340 --> 03:11:24.340]  This is us tending towards an entire nation of a socialized economy.
[03:11:24.340 --> 03:11:28.340]  We just saw that loud and clear in the last three years.
[03:11:28.340 --> 03:11:33.340]  Yes. Americans were truly faced with the idea that the doctors will do what they want to do.
[03:11:33.340 --> 03:11:38.340]  Then tell you how that care is going to go and people did not have a say.
[03:11:38.340 --> 03:11:44.340]  I want to be really specific because you mentioned about your family.
[03:11:44.340 --> 03:11:52.340]  There was direct policies where Medicare would pay the hospital more if they put you on a lethal protocol.
[03:11:52.340 --> 03:11:54.340]  That is shocking information.
[03:11:54.340 --> 03:11:57.340]  If you came into the hospital with COVID and you were admitted,
[03:11:57.340 --> 03:12:00.340]  which they always wanted to do because they got very large payment,
[03:12:00.340 --> 03:12:05.340]  and you went on remdesivir and did not go on ivermectin,
[03:12:05.340 --> 03:12:09.340]  the hospital got a large, I don't want to say bonus, but like a large payout.
[03:12:09.340 --> 03:12:13.340]  This is how we knew the system was corrupt beyond repair because if it was just the money,
[03:12:13.340 --> 03:12:16.340]  the lobbying to get remdesivir paid, that would be one thing.
[03:12:16.340 --> 03:12:19.340]  Why then not allow the patient to get ivermectin?
[03:12:19.340 --> 03:12:25.340]  Why that? You had to wonder if Medicare policies were set to actually kill people.
[03:12:25.340 --> 03:12:30.340]  Ivermectin was proven to be safe and effective for over 60 years,
[03:12:30.340 --> 03:12:35.340]  and remdesivir was just out of the gate after a failed trial with Ebola where it caused too much death.
[03:12:35.340 --> 03:12:40.340]  Yes, exactly. Hydroxychloroquine was FDA approved for almost 70 years.
[03:12:40.340 --> 03:12:42.340]  It's used all over the world. It's a very safe drug.
[03:12:42.340 --> 03:12:45.340]  Ivermectin, a precursor, actually won the Nobel Prize in Medicine.
[03:12:45.340 --> 03:12:47.340]  Remdesivir is a failed drug.
[03:12:47.340 --> 03:12:51.340]  Remdesivir was too dangerous to use with the lethal Ebola virus.
[03:12:51.340 --> 03:12:55.340]  But suddenly we're using it for the much more mild SARS virus?
[03:12:55.340 --> 03:12:56.340]  It made no sense.
[03:12:56.340 --> 03:12:57.340]  It didn't make sense.
[03:12:57.340 --> 03:13:00.340]  And the doctors were told to smile and say safe and effective,
[03:13:00.340 --> 03:13:02.340]  and we all knew the elephant in the room.
[03:13:02.340 --> 03:13:05.340]  And that was it had been out for two seconds and failed a trial.
[03:13:05.340 --> 03:13:09.340]  So for them to even say that was a lie, straight up lie to the patient's face.
[03:13:09.340 --> 03:13:13.340]  And so it was so destructive, so evil, what was going on.
[03:13:13.340 --> 03:13:16.340]  And you stepped out in the forefront, risked everything.
[03:13:16.340 --> 03:13:19.340]  You didn't know you were risking everything at the time, did you?
[03:13:19.340 --> 03:13:22.340]  I did not. People asked me. I had no idea.
[03:13:22.340 --> 03:13:27.340]  You know, I just wanted to say, you know, my reputation has been really badly maligned.
[03:13:27.340 --> 03:13:29.340]  And really, I'm a person who came up through the system.
[03:13:29.340 --> 03:13:32.340]  I mean, right up until 2020, you couldn't say anything bad about me.
[03:13:32.340 --> 03:13:34.340]  You couldn't find anything bad about me.
[03:13:34.340 --> 03:13:37.340]  I went to law school, I went to medical school, had top grades, had no conflict,
[03:13:37.340 --> 03:13:43.340]  had no complaints, had no men-mal situations, lawsuits, nothing, literally zero.
[03:13:43.340 --> 03:13:46.340]  I was very much a product of the system.
[03:13:46.340 --> 03:13:50.340]  You must be over the target.
[03:13:50.340 --> 03:13:52.340]  I am definitely over the target. I accept that.
[03:13:52.340 --> 03:13:54.340]  I am most definitely over the target.
[03:13:54.340 --> 03:13:57.340]  And the target is, you know, human slavery.
[03:13:57.340 --> 03:13:59.340]  And we're not going to allow it.
[03:13:59.340 --> 03:14:01.340]  It's amazing to me what's happened.
[03:14:01.340 --> 03:14:04.340]  And so you have something new, and I'm so glad that you've got this,
[03:14:04.340 --> 03:14:07.340]  because this is such a huge, huge big deal.
[03:14:07.340 --> 03:14:10.340]  Goldcare is amazing, and this is what everybody was clamoring for.
[03:14:10.340 --> 03:14:12.340]  We were thinking, well, what options do we have?
[03:14:12.340 --> 03:14:15.340]  This is a huge option I want people to know about.
[03:14:15.340 --> 03:14:17.340]  Yes, this is really important.
[03:14:17.340 --> 03:14:20.340]  So for the first year or two, everybody asked me how they could find early treatment.
[03:14:20.340 --> 03:14:22.340]  And then for the next year or two, everybody asked me,
[03:14:22.340 --> 03:14:25.340]  how can I find an ethical, honorable doctor who won't lie to me,
[03:14:25.340 --> 03:14:27.340]  who'll put me first, doctor-patient relationship?
[03:14:27.340 --> 03:14:30.340]  Let me tell you something, Kate. It's been pretty hard.
[03:14:30.340 --> 03:14:33.340]  We've amassed over the last few years those doctors that are like me,
[03:14:33.340 --> 03:14:36.340]  that are like-minded, that understand, you know, the patient comes first,
[03:14:36.340 --> 03:14:39.340]  and that there should be no conflict between, you know, what's best for the patient.
[03:14:39.340 --> 03:14:41.340]  That should be the only thing that matters.
[03:14:41.340 --> 03:14:44.340]  When you put a financial intermediary, the government or an insurance company,
[03:14:44.340 --> 03:14:47.340]  in between that relationship, it all goes wrong. It all goes south.
[03:14:47.340 --> 03:14:50.340]  So goldcare.com steps aside from the medical Marxist model
[03:14:50.340 --> 03:14:53.340]  that's currently running our healthcare institutions.
[03:14:53.340 --> 03:14:56.340]  We went from caring about the doctor-patient relationship and scientific integrity.
[03:14:56.340 --> 03:15:00.340]  We went to, you know, equity and diversity and health equality,
[03:15:00.340 --> 03:15:03.340]  and, you know, one size fits all pharmaceuticals.
[03:15:03.340 --> 03:15:05.340]  Literally, that's what's happened.
[03:15:05.340 --> 03:15:10.340]  So patients need to have an unbiased, smart advisor who they can trust.
[03:15:10.340 --> 03:15:12.340]  I mean, that's what most of medical care is,
[03:15:12.340 --> 03:15:15.340]  is, you know, going to some smart person who's had a lot of education,
[03:15:15.340 --> 03:15:18.340]  a lot of experience, who gives you unbiased advice,
[03:15:18.340 --> 03:15:20.340]  exactly like you might get from an attorney you pay,
[03:15:20.340 --> 03:15:22.340]  or tax account, or real estate specialist.
[03:15:22.340 --> 03:15:26.340]  You know that they're not biased other than, you know, your interest,
[03:15:26.340 --> 03:15:28.340]  because they want to work with you, they want to make their commission,
[03:15:28.340 --> 03:15:29.340]  or whatever the thing is.
[03:15:29.340 --> 03:15:31.340]  But that's what we need to bring back to medicine.
[03:15:31.340 --> 03:15:34.340]  We're going to come right back more with Simone Gold,
[03:15:34.340 --> 03:15:38.340]  but somebody that understands health instead of how to push more pharma,
[03:15:38.340 --> 03:15:41.340]  because that was, that's the whole idea now in the hospitals,
[03:15:41.340 --> 03:15:44.340]  and when you go into these clinics, it's pushing pharma, pushing pharma.
[03:15:44.340 --> 03:15:46.340]  I'm going to be right back with Dr. Simone Gold.
[03:15:46.340 --> 03:15:48.340]  We'll talk a little bit more about California,
[03:15:48.340 --> 03:15:50.340]  what's happening to the doctors there,
[03:15:50.340 --> 03:15:52.340]  because it's scary it's going to happen all over.
[03:15:52.340 --> 03:16:21.340]  Be right back on The Alex Jones Show.
[03:16:22.340 --> 03:16:25.340]  I've been given so many opportunities because of this man,
[03:16:25.340 --> 03:16:26.340]  and because of this platform,
[03:16:26.340 --> 03:16:29.340]  and I would probably not even be half of where I am right now,
[03:16:29.340 --> 03:16:31.340]  if it weren't for Alex Jones.
[03:16:31.340 --> 03:16:34.340]  I mean, I've been able to be on podcasts with Alex and Joe Rogan,
[03:16:34.340 --> 03:16:37.340]  and Tim Cass, the super Tim Cass IRL.
[03:16:37.340 --> 03:16:42.340]  Listen, what I'm saying is, do not take Alex Jones and Bandot video for granted,
[03:16:42.340 --> 03:16:44.340]  because you don't know what you have until it's gone.
[03:16:44.340 --> 03:16:47.340]  We need to support free speech systems right now,

[03:17:56.340 --> 03:18:02.340]  In the year 2000, Alex Jones' film Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove
[03:18:02.340 --> 03:18:05.340]  showed the world how our so-called elite leaders
[03:18:05.340 --> 03:18:09.340]  practice mock ritual sacrifices in private.
[03:18:11.340 --> 03:18:15.340]  In 2007, Alex Jones releases Endgame,
[03:18:15.340 --> 03:18:17.340]  exposing the world elite's plans
[03:18:17.340 --> 03:18:22.340]  for covertly using biological weapons against all of mankind.
[03:18:22.340 --> 03:18:25.340]  And by the time they launched their attack in 2020,
[03:18:25.340 --> 03:18:28.340]  Alex Jones' InfoWars and our audience
[03:18:28.340 --> 03:18:32.340]  were there to warn the people of the deadly vaccines
[03:18:32.340 --> 03:18:34.340]  that we knew were coming.
[03:18:34.340 --> 03:18:36.340]  This is why they attack us.
[03:18:36.340 --> 03:18:38.340]  This is why we need your support.
[03:18:38.340 --> 03:18:42.340]  Because we tell the truth, Alex Jones was right.

[03:19:02.340 --> 03:19:05.340]  showed the world how our so-called elite leaders
[03:19:05.340 --> 03:19:09.340]  practice mock ritual sacrifices in private.

[03:20:11.340 --> 03:20:13.340]  Back here with you on the Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:13.340 --> 03:20:16.340]  I'm Kate Dahle, your guest host from KateDahleRadio.com.
[03:20:16.340 --> 03:20:19.340]  My guest, Dr. Simone Gold, joins me.
[03:20:19.340 --> 03:20:21.340]  And let me just tell you the hospitals,
[03:20:21.340 --> 03:20:24.340]  what's going on in California with all of the doctors,
[03:20:24.340 --> 03:20:26.340]  not just the hospitals, but all of the doctors.
[03:20:26.340 --> 03:20:28.340]  And whenever I see a bill in California,
[03:20:28.340 --> 03:20:30.340]  I see a bill in New York, just watch,
[03:20:30.340 --> 03:20:32.340]  because it takes about three years,
[03:20:32.340 --> 03:20:34.340]  and the rest of the country usually gets it
[03:20:34.340 --> 03:20:35.340]  or grabs ahold of it.
[03:20:35.340 --> 03:20:37.340]  So we really ought to pay attention
[03:20:37.340 --> 03:20:39.340]  to what is happening in California
[03:20:39.340 --> 03:20:41.340]  to our doctors in California.
[03:20:41.340 --> 03:20:43.340]  Can you expand on this, Dr. Gold?
[03:20:43.340 --> 03:20:46.340]  Yes, starting on January, this bill was winding its way,
[03:20:46.340 --> 03:20:49.340]  it's called AB 2098, and it was winding its way
[03:20:49.340 --> 03:20:51.340]  through California legislature all of 22,
[03:20:51.340 --> 03:20:53.340]  and it became law on January 1st, 2023.
[03:20:53.340 --> 03:20:56.340]  And this bill outlaws doctors' second opinion.
[03:20:56.340 --> 03:20:58.340]  I'm sorry, but that's all it does.
[03:20:58.340 --> 03:21:00.340]  It says that if a doctor says things
[03:21:00.340 --> 03:21:02.340]  that disagree with the contemporary science
[03:21:02.340 --> 03:21:03.340]  or some phrase like that,
[03:21:03.340 --> 03:21:05.340]  that that could threaten their license,
[03:21:05.340 --> 03:21:07.340]  which is really their livelihood.
[03:21:07.340 --> 03:21:08.340]  So let's break that down.
[03:21:08.340 --> 03:21:10.340]  First of all, it strips doctors,
[03:21:10.340 --> 03:21:14.340]  one particular group of their normal First Amendment rights.
[03:21:14.340 --> 03:21:16.340]  So this is just a very dangerous precedent
[03:21:16.340 --> 03:21:18.340]  that there would be any one group
[03:21:18.340 --> 03:21:20.340]  that's licensed by the state
[03:21:20.340 --> 03:21:22.340]  that could lose their livelihood
[03:21:22.340 --> 03:21:25.340]  based on a free speech, unbridgeable,
[03:21:25.340 --> 03:21:28.340]  unwaivable constitutional rights such as free speech.
[03:21:28.340 --> 03:21:29.340]  That's very dangerous.
[03:21:29.340 --> 03:21:30.340]  And then number two,
[03:21:30.340 --> 03:21:32.340]  the group that they're targeting is doctors.
[03:21:32.340 --> 03:21:34.340]  So doctors can no longer, in California,
[03:21:34.340 --> 03:21:37.340]  comfortably tell you what they think about,
[03:21:37.340 --> 03:21:38.340]  for example, COVID.
[03:21:38.340 --> 03:21:39.340]  They can't tell you early treatment.
[03:21:39.340 --> 03:21:41.340]  They can't tell you what they think about remdesivir.
[03:21:41.340 --> 03:21:42.340]  They can't do that,
[03:21:42.340 --> 03:21:44.340]  or they might lose their license and their livelihood.
[03:21:44.340 --> 03:21:46.340]  It's incredibly extreme.
[03:21:46.340 --> 03:21:48.340]  It violates the First and 14th Amendments.
[03:21:48.340 --> 03:21:51.340]  I do believe and hope it will be struck down.
[03:21:51.340 --> 03:21:53.340]  It's in a temporary injunction right now.
[03:21:53.340 --> 03:21:56.340]  But if this law stands,
[03:21:56.340 --> 03:22:01.340]  there's no exaggerating how severe an impact this will have.
[03:22:01.340 --> 03:22:03.340]  I can't imagine that kind of censorship.
[03:22:03.340 --> 03:22:05.340]  So basically, they're not doctors anymore.
[03:22:05.340 --> 03:22:07.340]  They are directed by the NIH,
[03:22:07.340 --> 03:22:10.340]  who directs, then, the administrations at the hospitals,
[03:22:10.340 --> 03:22:14.340]  to give them marching orders that were written by lawyers
[03:22:14.340 --> 03:22:17.340]  on how to prescribe and what to do with a patient,
[03:22:17.340 --> 03:22:18.340]  given a number system.
[03:22:18.340 --> 03:22:23.340]  Honestly, let me be the first one to say this.
[03:22:23.340 --> 03:22:25.340]  They're robots, and they're killing robots.
[03:22:25.340 --> 03:22:27.340]  They're robots that will be deployed
[03:22:27.340 --> 03:22:30.340]  in service of a government mandate,
[03:22:30.340 --> 03:22:32.340]  whatever that mandate might be.
[03:22:32.340 --> 03:22:35.340]  In the era of COVID, we saw Medicare policies
[03:22:35.340 --> 03:22:39.340]  that killed older Medicare recipients.
[03:22:39.340 --> 03:22:43.340]  Why wouldn't they deploy that going forward?
[03:22:43.340 --> 03:22:44.340]  They would.
[03:22:44.340 --> 03:22:45.340]  They would.
[03:22:45.340 --> 03:22:47.340]  And so people are so afraid to lose their job
[03:22:47.340 --> 03:22:50.340]  that they would absolutely go with the mandated protocol
[03:22:50.340 --> 03:22:52.340]  from the NIH in every instance.
[03:22:52.340 --> 03:22:55.340]  And those laws, there were laws changed in February of 2020,
[03:22:55.340 --> 03:22:58.340]  ironically, right before the mystery was named
[03:22:58.340 --> 03:23:02.340]  and the solution was already being manufactured, right?
[03:23:02.340 --> 03:23:05.340]  This vaccine, amazing.
[03:23:05.340 --> 03:23:07.340]  The way forward out of this is every person
[03:23:07.340 --> 03:23:09.340]  is going to have to advocate for themselves.
[03:23:09.340 --> 03:23:11.340]  And in some areas of life that are kind of complicated,
[03:23:11.340 --> 03:23:13.340]  you're going to need a smart advisor on your side
[03:23:13.340 --> 03:23:14.340]  who you can trust.
[03:23:14.340 --> 03:23:16.340]  That's the vision behind gold care,
[03:23:16.340 --> 03:23:20.340]  is that you're living in California and you can't move, right?
[03:23:20.340 --> 03:23:22.340]  And you know that you're a doctor in California,
[03:23:22.340 --> 03:23:24.340]  maybe can't say what they need to say,
[03:23:24.340 --> 03:23:25.340]  then you need to go to goldcare.com,
[03:23:25.340 --> 03:23:27.340]  become a member of our community,
[03:23:27.340 --> 03:23:30.340]  and talk to a doctor who can give you straightforward information,
[03:23:30.340 --> 03:23:31.340]  and then you can take that information
[03:23:31.340 --> 03:23:33.340]  and win your life.
[03:23:33.340 --> 03:23:35.340]  And that's really what it's going to have to be for people.
[03:23:35.340 --> 03:23:37.340]  Honestly, goldcare.com is, honestly,
[03:23:37.340 --> 03:23:39.340]  it's the best answer for people in California.
[03:23:39.340 --> 03:23:41.340]  Oh, absolutely.
[03:23:41.340 --> 03:23:43.340]  Because I think people hasn't registered yet,
[03:23:43.340 --> 03:23:45.340]  and it did for some like me that ended up
[03:23:45.340 --> 03:23:46.340]  in the hospital with a spouse,
[03:23:46.340 --> 03:23:48.340]  but it doesn't register for people
[03:23:48.340 --> 03:23:50.340]  that we are worse than Canada almost.
[03:23:50.340 --> 03:23:53.340]  We are at that point where socialized medicine
[03:23:53.340 --> 03:23:56.340]  has so infiltrated and the doctors aren't saying anything.
[03:23:56.340 --> 03:23:58.340]  Everybody still thinks, oh, that's just my nice doctor.
[03:23:58.340 --> 03:24:00.340]  Why would he lie to me?
[03:24:00.340 --> 03:24:02.340]  But you know what, and we talked about this
[03:24:02.340 --> 03:24:04.340]  in a previous interview, too,
[03:24:04.340 --> 03:24:06.340]  the doctors going along with this.
[03:24:06.340 --> 03:24:08.340]  Why do they go along with this, Dr. Gold?
[03:24:08.340 --> 03:24:10.340]  Why do they just smile and do what they're told?
[03:24:10.340 --> 03:24:12.340]  It's both.
[03:24:12.340 --> 03:24:13.340]  It's both their employees
[03:24:13.340 --> 03:24:15.340]  that are following their own financial interests,
[03:24:15.340 --> 03:24:17.340]  and honestly, it's disappointing how
[03:24:17.340 --> 03:24:19.340]  the lack of curiosity doctors had.
[03:24:19.340 --> 03:24:21.340]  It's just incredibly disappointing.
[03:24:21.340 --> 03:24:23.340]  This stuff is not easy, it's not hard to figure out.
[03:24:23.340 --> 03:24:24.340]  You can read the medical journals,
[03:24:24.340 --> 03:24:27.340]  and I was not uniquely gifted
[03:24:27.340 --> 03:24:29.340]  in my ability to read.
[03:24:29.340 --> 03:24:31.340]  Like, that was available to everyone,
[03:24:31.340 --> 03:24:33.340]  certainly all the doctors.
[03:24:33.340 --> 03:24:34.340]  You could read the journals,
[03:24:34.340 --> 03:24:36.340]  you could discover that early treatment didn't work.
[03:24:36.340 --> 03:24:38.340]  If you had read anything on public health,
[03:24:38.340 --> 03:24:40.340]  in all of your years in medical school,
[03:24:40.340 --> 03:24:42.340]  you knew that masks didn't work,
[03:24:42.340 --> 03:24:44.340]  you knew that quarantining healthy people didn't work.
[03:24:44.340 --> 03:24:46.340]  This was all public health 101.
[03:24:46.340 --> 03:24:48.340]  So I'm saying we're entering a new era
[03:24:48.340 --> 03:24:50.340]  where people are going to have to advocate for themselves,
[03:24:50.340 --> 03:24:52.340]  and if you're just going to listen to other people,
[03:24:52.340 --> 03:24:54.340]  you're going to be in jeopardy.
[03:24:54.340 --> 03:24:56.340]  Oh, 100%.
[03:24:56.340 --> 03:24:58.340]  And as this bill sells through the other states,
[03:24:58.340 --> 03:25:00.340]  which I have a feeling they're going to try,
[03:25:00.340 --> 03:25:02.340]  those in California need to work really hard
[03:25:02.340 --> 03:25:04.340]  against this from happening
[03:25:04.340 --> 03:25:06.340]  so that it doesn't blanket the nation
[03:25:06.340 --> 03:25:07.340]  like it does with most bills,
[03:25:07.340 --> 03:25:10.340]  but also the fact that you can't listen to a doctor
[03:25:10.340 --> 03:25:11.340]  censorship.
[03:25:11.340 --> 03:25:13.340]  I don't even know what's worse.
[03:25:13.340 --> 03:25:15.340]  I mean, this is our healthcare.
[03:25:15.340 --> 03:25:17.340]  You know how bad this bill is?
[03:25:17.340 --> 03:25:19.340]  This bill is so bad that people on the right
[03:25:19.340 --> 03:25:21.340]  and on the left are agreeing.
[03:25:21.340 --> 03:25:22.340]  So America's frontline doctors
[03:25:22.340 --> 03:25:24.340]  is vehemently opposed to this bill,
[03:25:24.340 --> 03:25:26.340]  and so is the ACLU.
[03:25:26.340 --> 03:25:28.340]  The ACLU is opposed to this bill.
[03:25:28.340 --> 03:25:30.340]  This is really bad news for California.
[03:25:30.340 --> 03:25:32.340]  They need to really get up in arms.
[03:25:32.340 --> 03:25:34.340]  There's a couple of challenges to it now.
[03:25:34.340 --> 03:25:35.340]  This is really bad news.
[03:25:35.340 --> 03:25:37.340]  Other states, freedom states like Florida,
[03:25:37.340 --> 03:25:38.340]  are taking note of this.
[03:25:38.340 --> 03:25:40.340]  I think Florida, God willing,
[03:25:40.340 --> 03:25:42.340]  will put things in its constitution
[03:25:42.340 --> 03:25:44.340]  so this kind of challenge can never happen.
[03:25:44.340 --> 03:25:45.340]  But this is very important.
[03:25:45.340 --> 03:25:47.340]  Let's keep following this story.
[03:25:47.340 --> 03:25:48.340]  Absolutely.
[03:25:48.340 --> 03:25:50.340]  And it takes a lot of doctors too to follow along
[03:25:50.340 --> 03:25:54.340]  if doctors would step out of this awful cycle
[03:25:54.340 --> 03:25:57.340]  and become part of places like gold care.
[03:25:57.340 --> 03:25:59.340]  That would be an amazing feat
[03:25:59.340 --> 03:26:00.340]  because in order to do this,
[03:26:00.340 --> 03:26:02.340]  they have to have a lot of willing soldiers
[03:26:02.340 --> 03:26:03.340]  in order to do that.
[03:26:03.340 --> 03:26:05.340]  So when I say soldiers, you know, I mean doctors,
[03:26:05.340 --> 03:26:08.340]  but they need a lot of willing participants
[03:26:08.340 --> 03:26:11.340]  and if doctors would have the courage to stand up
[03:26:11.340 --> 03:26:14.340]  and be curious about what they're doing.
[03:26:14.340 --> 03:26:16.340]  Honestly, that's what we're doing at GoldCare.com.
[03:26:16.340 --> 03:26:19.340]  We've collected these fierce warrior physicians,
[03:26:19.340 --> 03:26:22.340]  but over time, as gold care spreads,
[03:26:22.340 --> 03:26:25.340]  it will be an honorable place for doctors to work.
[03:26:25.340 --> 03:26:27.340]  So we're going to end up attracting a lot of honorable doctors
[03:26:27.340 --> 03:26:28.340]  and that's how you do it.
[03:26:28.340 --> 03:26:30.340]  That's how you take it back.
[03:26:30.340 --> 03:26:31.340]  Absolutely.
[03:26:31.340 --> 03:26:33.340]  And more and more people are questioning
[03:26:33.340 --> 03:26:35.340]  as we have more and more deaths from the shots,
[03:26:35.340 --> 03:26:37.340]  not in the COVID year, but from the shots
[03:26:37.340 --> 03:26:39.340]  and as they're even stupidly blaming COVID
[03:26:39.340 --> 03:26:41.340]  for the deaths from the shots.
[03:26:41.340 --> 03:26:44.340]  And, you know, will more information be coming out?
[03:26:44.340 --> 03:26:45.340]  What do you think, Dr. Gold?
[03:26:45.340 --> 03:26:47.340]  Will we get more and more and more?
[03:26:47.340 --> 03:26:49.340]  Will people find any real life?
[03:26:49.340 --> 03:26:52.340]  Honestly, there is an abundance of information already.
[03:26:52.340 --> 03:26:53.340]  It's just so suppressed.
[03:26:53.340 --> 03:26:55.340]  I mean, everything, first of all,
[03:26:55.340 --> 03:26:56.340]  when you looked at the spike proteins,
[03:26:56.340 --> 03:26:58.340]  you knew it caused clotting, right?
[03:26:58.340 --> 03:27:00.340]  You knew it was challenging the immune system
[03:27:00.340 --> 03:27:02.340]  when you're putting this foreign body into your body.
[03:27:02.340 --> 03:27:03.340]  So what a surprise.
[03:27:03.340 --> 03:27:06.340]  We're seeing clotting diseases and we're seeing immune dysfunction.
[03:27:06.340 --> 03:27:07.340]  So the evidence is there.
[03:27:07.340 --> 03:27:09.340]  A lot of people are just like covering their eyes, you know,
[03:27:09.340 --> 03:27:12.340]  and they won't look at the evidence, but the evidence is there.
[03:27:12.340 --> 03:27:14.340]  You know what will happen, though,
[03:27:14.340 --> 03:27:15.340]  to answer you in kind of a positive way
[03:27:15.340 --> 03:27:18.340]  is that you won't need media to tell you this.
[03:27:18.340 --> 03:27:20.340]  People are actually experiencing it in their own lives.
[03:27:20.340 --> 03:27:22.340]  There's so many people who took the shots,
[03:27:22.340 --> 03:27:24.340]  who themselves experienced problems
[03:27:24.340 --> 03:27:26.340]  or knew someone who experienced problems,
[03:27:26.340 --> 03:27:28.340]  and almost everybody who took the shots
[03:27:28.340 --> 03:27:32.340]  knows someone who got sick or multiple times sick after the shot.
[03:27:32.340 --> 03:27:35.340]  So at the very least, they're on notice that the thing didn't work.
[03:27:35.340 --> 03:27:37.340]  So there's a lot of Americans who understand
[03:27:37.340 --> 03:27:40.340]  that the government lied to them about the safe part
[03:27:40.340 --> 03:27:43.340]  and certainly about the lack of effective part.
[03:27:43.340 --> 03:27:44.340]  So that part's good.
[03:27:44.340 --> 03:27:46.340]  You know, you can't censor the stuff
[03:27:46.340 --> 03:27:48.340]  that's actually happened to you in your own life.
[03:27:48.340 --> 03:27:49.340]  Absolutely.
[03:27:49.340 --> 03:27:50.340]  And it's right in front of their face.
[03:27:50.340 --> 03:27:51.340]  It can't be ignored.
[03:27:51.340 --> 03:27:54.340]  And they weren't having these things happen in 2020.
[03:27:54.340 --> 03:27:57.340]  And so, my gosh, a cold does not cause blood clots
[03:27:57.340 --> 03:28:01.340]  and myocarditis, which used to be very, very rare.
[03:28:01.340 --> 03:28:03.340]  And I just appreciate all your efforts.
[03:28:03.340 --> 03:28:07.340]  Tell people where to go to get some help.
[03:28:07.340 --> 03:28:08.340]  Yes.
[03:28:08.340 --> 03:28:09.340]  Please go.
[03:28:09.340 --> 03:28:11.340]  You can go to my website, which is my name,
[03:28:11.340 --> 03:28:16.340]  DrSimonGold.com, DrSimonGold.com, and please check out
[03:28:16.340 --> 03:28:19.340]  GoldCare.com, which is on my website.
[03:28:19.340 --> 03:28:21.340]  It really is the solution.
[03:28:21.340 --> 03:28:25.340]  We have to start supporting those businesses that,
[03:28:25.340 --> 03:28:29.340]  on our side of the aisle, that want to promote freedom
[03:28:29.340 --> 03:28:32.340]  and want to promote your ability to defend yourself
[03:28:32.340 --> 03:28:35.340]  and your family and live healthy and free.
[03:28:35.340 --> 03:28:37.340]  So GoldCare.com is the medical solution.
[03:28:37.340 --> 03:28:40.340]  There's other media solutions like InfoWars, et cetera.
[03:28:40.340 --> 03:28:43.340]  Please come to DrSimonGold.com.
[03:28:43.340 --> 03:28:46.340]  Thank you, Dr. Gold, for joining me on The Alex Jones Show.
[03:28:46.340 --> 03:28:47.340]  I really appreciate it.
[03:28:47.340 --> 03:28:48.340]  Thank you.
[03:28:48.340 --> 03:28:49.340]  I'll be right back.
[03:28:49.340 --> 03:28:50.340]  Don't go anywhere.
[03:28:50.340 --> 03:29:18.340]  I want to talk to Chinese Balloon.
[03:29:18.340 --> 03:29:25.340]  Thank you, Dr. Gold, for joining us.
[03:29:25.340 --> 03:29:54.340]  Thank you, Dr. Gold.
[03:29:54.340 --> 03:29:58.340]  If you go to onlinehealthnow.com,
[03:29:58.340 --> 03:30:00.340]  connect with trusted and unbiased doctors
[03:30:00.340 --> 03:30:02.340]  at the wellness company.
[03:30:02.340 --> 03:30:05.340]  And I tell you, I'm honored to be the chief scientific officer
[03:30:05.340 --> 03:30:06.340]  of the company.
[03:30:06.340 --> 03:30:08.340]  I contribute with, like, so many else do there,
[03:30:08.340 --> 03:30:10.340]  so many wonderful doctors.
[03:30:10.340 --> 03:30:12.340]  Far and away, the most popular product
[03:30:12.340 --> 03:30:16.340]  is Dr. van de Water's detoxification supplement
[03:30:16.340 --> 03:30:18.340]  that features natokinase.
[03:30:18.340 --> 03:30:20.340]  It's a natural proteolytic enzyme.
[03:30:20.340 --> 03:30:23.340]  This one is the only enzyme that we're aware of right now.
[03:30:23.340 --> 03:30:25.340]  That dissolves the spike protein.
[03:30:25.340 --> 03:30:26.340]  This is very important.
[03:30:26.340 --> 03:30:28.340]  The spike protein is loaded in the body
[03:30:28.340 --> 03:30:29.340]  with the COVID-19 infection.
[03:30:29.340 --> 03:30:31.340]  And definitely with the vaccines,
[03:30:31.340 --> 03:30:33.340]  people are lower with the spike protein.
[03:30:33.340 --> 03:30:34.340]  They don't feel well.
[03:30:34.340 --> 03:30:35.340]  This is a potential solution.
[03:30:35.340 --> 03:30:38.340]  Hydroxychloroquine comes from a natural substance.
[03:30:38.340 --> 03:30:41.340]  So does ivermectin and now natokinase.
[03:30:41.340 --> 03:30:42.340]  Isn't it interesting?
[03:30:42.340 --> 03:30:44.340]  Natural substances, in a sense,
[03:30:44.340 --> 03:30:46.340]  combating this man-made disaster,
[03:30:46.340 --> 03:30:48.340]  SARS-CoV-2, in the vaccines.
[03:30:48.340 --> 03:30:51.340]  Onlinehealthnow.com, thank you for your support.
[03:30:51.340 --> 03:30:53.340]  And thank you for getting into that,
[03:30:53.340 --> 03:30:54.340]  because it's important.
[03:30:54.340 --> 03:30:56.340]  You didn't come here to do that, but I made you do it.
[03:30:56.340 --> 03:31:00.340]  The most banned man in America, Alex Jones.
[03:31:04.340 --> 03:31:05.340]  I want you all to know something.
[03:31:05.340 --> 03:31:07.340]  Alex Jones was right.
[03:31:07.340 --> 03:31:11.340]  Alex is right about far more things wrong.
[03:31:11.340 --> 03:31:14.340]  Alex has been right on court over a decade.
[03:31:14.340 --> 03:31:16.340]  I don't care how your face is diced
[03:31:16.340 --> 03:31:18.340]  and flipped it up or rub it down.
[03:31:18.340 --> 03:31:21.340]  Alex Jones was right.
[03:31:21.340 --> 03:31:22.340]  Think about how frustrated we are
[03:31:22.340 --> 03:31:24.340]  if you've been awake for a year or two.
[03:31:24.340 --> 03:31:26.340]  Imagine being like an Alex Jones
[03:31:26.340 --> 03:31:28.340]  or those guys who've been awake for, like, decades.
[03:31:28.340 --> 03:31:31.340]  Alex Jones called this years ago.
[03:31:31.340 --> 03:31:32.340]  Years ago.
[03:31:32.340 --> 03:31:34.340]  Alex Jones never bought the Russia hoax.
[03:31:34.340 --> 03:31:36.340]  Not for a second.
[03:31:36.340 --> 03:31:38.340]  You are one of the great thinkers of this.
[03:31:38.340 --> 03:31:41.340]  You are a martyr to the First Amendment.
[03:31:41.340 --> 03:31:44.340]  The government, beers, Alex Jones.
[03:31:44.340 --> 03:31:46.340]  That's why the globalists hate me,
[03:31:46.340 --> 03:31:49.340]  is because I'm exposing their corporate worldwide tyranny.
[03:31:51.340 --> 03:31:53.340]  AlexJonesLive.com
[03:31:56.340 --> 03:31:58.340]  Well, I think it's fantastic stuff.
[03:31:58.340 --> 03:31:59.340]  Diet Force.
[03:31:59.340 --> 03:32:01.340]  Diet Force is amazing.
[03:32:01.340 --> 03:32:03.340]  I'm 45, and I have bits.
[03:32:03.340 --> 03:32:06.340]  I go to the gym, and I have bits that won't move.
[03:32:06.340 --> 03:32:10.340]  And Diet Force has helped me move those bits.
[03:32:10.340 --> 03:32:14.340]  Under my packs, my belly, I'm just taking Diet Force
[03:32:14.340 --> 03:32:16.340]  to tablets a day.
[03:32:16.340 --> 03:32:18.340]  Man, if you're, like, struggling to get,
[03:32:18.340 --> 03:32:21.340]  like, chip shaped for the ladies,
[03:32:21.340 --> 03:32:24.340]  mate, Diet Force is the go.
[03:32:24.340 --> 03:32:27.340]  You have to get the Diet Force and have it to a day.
[03:32:27.340 --> 03:32:28.340]  And just keep active.
[03:32:28.340 --> 03:32:30.340]  InfoWarsStore.com
[03:32:30.340 --> 03:32:32.340]  X7 Diet Force.

[03:32:35.340 --> 03:32:36.340]  Diet Force.

[03:32:41.340 --> 03:32:42.340]  God bless Australia.
[03:32:42.340 --> 03:32:43.340]  We'll be right back, folks.
[03:32:43.340 --> 03:32:44.340]  Don't go anywhere.

[03:32:46.340 --> 03:33:13.340]  Get it now.
[03:33:13.340 --> 03:33:17.340]  Get to the so-called Chinese balloon in just a moment.
[03:33:17.340 --> 03:33:20.340]  I asked Dr. Gold to come back because I failed to talk about it.
[03:33:20.340 --> 03:33:23.340]  I wanted to ask her about this lawsuit.
[03:33:23.340 --> 03:33:27.340]  People are wondering where we're going forward with the AFLDS,
[03:33:27.340 --> 03:33:30.340]  the American Frontline Doctors, Dr. Gold.
[03:33:30.340 --> 03:33:33.340]  Thank you for joining me because the recent rumors,
[03:33:33.340 --> 03:33:35.340]  the allegations, the controversy,
[03:33:35.340 --> 03:33:38.340]  so many people went to American Frontline Doctors for help,
[03:33:38.340 --> 03:33:39.340]  got that help.
[03:33:39.340 --> 03:33:43.340]  It has been amazing in turning around the narrative of COVID.
[03:33:43.340 --> 03:33:45.340]  And so where does it stand now?
[03:33:45.340 --> 03:33:47.340]  What is going on right now?
[03:33:47.340 --> 03:33:48.340]  Thank you so much.
[03:33:48.340 --> 03:33:50.340]  Yes, I've been pretty badly defamed.
[03:33:50.340 --> 03:33:55.340]  I just asked people to recognize I'm exactly who I've always been.
[03:33:55.340 --> 03:34:01.340]  Nobody does what I do and would do things that were alleged against me.
[03:34:01.340 --> 03:34:05.340]  It just would be completely inconsistent with everything I've done in my life.
[03:34:05.340 --> 03:34:10.340]  But when I went into serve my prison sentence, I had to make some adjustments on the board
[03:34:10.340 --> 03:34:13.340]  and there really became a disconnect and a misunderstanding
[03:34:13.340 --> 03:34:16.340]  between the board and myself as to the vision going forward.
[03:34:16.340 --> 03:34:18.340]  And it got pretty heated.
[03:34:18.340 --> 03:34:20.340]  I understand that.
[03:34:20.340 --> 03:34:24.340]  This forced litigation between the board and myself.
[03:34:24.340 --> 03:34:27.340]  And that litigation thus far, the judge has made a statement
[03:34:27.340 --> 03:34:31.340]  and the judge said that the board needs to come together with me
[03:34:31.340 --> 03:34:33.340]  and resolve the issue internally.
[03:34:33.340 --> 03:34:36.340]  And the judge recognized that AFLJS cannot function,
[03:34:36.340 --> 03:34:38.340]  cannot survive without my leadership.
[03:34:38.340 --> 03:34:42.340]  So I am calling on the board to heed the judge's advice,
[03:34:42.340 --> 03:34:45.340]  which is to meet together, to negotiate, to settle this thing
[03:34:45.340 --> 03:34:48.340]  and just move on because AFLJS has a lot of work to do.
[03:34:48.340 --> 03:34:54.340]  It has come to my attention that the real obstacle to these negotiated settlement
[03:34:54.340 --> 03:34:58.340]  with the board members is really the law firm Wagon Maker and Overly.
[03:34:58.340 --> 03:35:01.340]  Wagon Maker and Overly out of Chicago,
[03:35:01.340 --> 03:35:04.340]  the law firm representing some members of the board,
[03:35:04.340 --> 03:35:08.340]  and they are really standing in the way of a negotiation.
[03:35:08.340 --> 03:35:11.340]  I know that if we sit down, we'll be able to resolve our differences,
[03:35:11.340 --> 03:35:14.340]  but Wagon Maker and Overly is really standing in the way
[03:35:14.340 --> 03:35:17.340]  and it's very inappropriate for a law firm to do that.
[03:35:17.340 --> 03:35:19.340]  And I'm actually asking everyone who hears my voice,
[03:35:19.340 --> 03:35:21.340]  everyone who understands that America's Frontline Doctors
[03:35:21.340 --> 03:35:23.340]  has a big mission ahead of us.
[03:35:23.340 --> 03:35:25.340]  Medical tyranny is just like beating down on us.
[03:35:25.340 --> 03:35:28.340]  Please contact Wagon Maker and Overly in Chicago.
[03:35:28.340 --> 03:35:33.340]  Sally Wagon Maker is standing in the way of us getting to a negotiated settlement,
[03:35:33.340 --> 03:35:35.340]  Dr. Gold, AFLJS, and the board.
[03:35:35.340 --> 03:35:37.340]  And I appreciate the public's help in that.
[03:35:37.340 --> 03:35:46.340]  Wagon Maker, W-A-G-E-N-M-A-K-E-R, law.com.
[03:35:46.340 --> 03:35:49.340]  Yeah, absolutely help with this because, you know,
[03:35:49.340 --> 03:35:51.340]  Frontline Doctors, American Frontline Doctors,
[03:35:51.340 --> 03:35:53.340]  stepped in when no one else would.
[03:35:53.340 --> 03:35:55.340]  They all risked their careers to do it
[03:35:55.340 --> 03:35:58.340]  and they didn't realize even how much they were risking at the time,
[03:35:58.340 --> 03:35:59.340]  but they stuck with it.
[03:35:59.340 --> 03:36:01.340]  And Dr. Simone Gold stuck with that
[03:36:01.340 --> 03:36:06.340]  and absolutely championed for the right to actual health care
[03:36:06.340 --> 03:36:09.340]  when the hospitals were basically killing people.
[03:36:09.340 --> 03:36:11.340]  So I really, really appreciate that.
[03:36:11.340 --> 03:36:13.340]  A pandemic isn't a pandemic if the only people that die
[03:36:13.340 --> 03:36:15.340]  are in the ICU under an experimental drug.
[03:36:15.340 --> 03:36:18.340]  So I love what you guys have done
[03:36:18.340 --> 03:36:21.340]  and I want you guys to continue that mission.
[03:36:21.340 --> 03:36:23.340]  And I think you're right about that.
[03:36:23.340 --> 03:36:26.340]  Sometimes you get these lawyers that will stand in the way
[03:36:26.340 --> 03:36:29.340]  and do a lot of damage when things could be,
[03:36:29.340 --> 03:36:32.340]  I think, easily solved, right?
[03:36:32.340 --> 03:36:34.340]  There's no, America's Frontline Doctors
[03:36:34.340 --> 03:36:36.340]  is filled with the most ethical, most honorable,
[03:36:36.340 --> 03:36:38.340]  fiercest freedom worries you can imagine.
[03:36:38.340 --> 03:36:40.340]  Brilliant scientists, brilliant doctors.
[03:36:40.340 --> 03:36:41.340]  We have thousands of us.
[03:36:41.340 --> 03:36:45.340]  All of that is being put at risk by this attorney law firm,
[03:36:45.340 --> 03:36:50.340]  Sally Wagon Maker, WagonMakerLaw.com
[03:36:50.340 --> 03:36:52.340]  needs to hear from the public
[03:36:52.340 --> 03:36:55.340]  that she needs to not stand in the way
[03:36:55.340 --> 03:36:58.340]  of a negotiated settlement between Dr. Gold and the board.
[03:36:58.340 --> 03:37:00.340]  Yep, thank you so much.
[03:37:00.340 --> 03:37:02.340]  Thanks for joining me, Dr. Simone Gold.
[03:37:02.340 --> 03:37:04.340]  I really appreciate you clearing that up
[03:37:04.340 --> 03:37:06.340]  because there's been a lot of controversy.
[03:37:06.340 --> 03:37:08.340]  People did not know where to turn in this controversy
[03:37:08.340 --> 03:37:10.340]  and so I really appreciate you. Thank you.
[03:37:10.340 --> 03:37:14.340]  I'm putting out a little bit of a documentary about this.
[03:37:14.340 --> 03:37:16.340]  Give me about a week.
[03:37:16.340 --> 03:37:18.340]  Oh, good. I'm so glad.
[03:37:18.340 --> 03:37:21.340]  I'm really glad because I really like what you have done
[03:37:21.340 --> 03:37:25.340]  and I just like what you've done with healthcare
[03:37:25.340 --> 03:37:27.340]  and turning this whole narrative around.
[03:37:27.340 --> 03:37:29.340]  It has not been easy and you face a lot,
[03:37:29.340 --> 03:37:31.340]  even incarcerated.
[03:37:31.340 --> 03:37:33.340]  Just for giving a speech, you were an invited guest,
[03:37:33.340 --> 03:37:35.340]  a speech on healthcare at the Capitol.
[03:37:35.340 --> 03:37:39.340]  So what they have done to you is just appalling
[03:37:39.340 --> 03:37:41.340]  and I appreciate all your efforts.
[03:37:41.340 --> 03:37:42.340]  I really do.
[03:37:42.340 --> 03:37:44.340]  Thank you so much. Thank you.
[03:37:44.340 --> 03:37:47.340]  Thanks for joining me. Thanks, Dr. Simone Gold.
[03:37:47.340 --> 03:37:52.340]  I want to also talk about this.
[03:37:52.340 --> 03:37:54.340]  I love what they're doing, by the way.
[03:37:54.340 --> 03:37:55.340]  Go to gold care, seriously.
[03:37:55.340 --> 03:37:57.340]  They're just doing a tremendous job.
[03:37:57.340 --> 03:38:00.340]  If it wasn't for doctors like Dr. Simone Gold,
[03:38:00.340 --> 03:38:03.340]  I would be a widow right now and I can't fathom that.
[03:38:03.340 --> 03:38:06.340]  It makes me sick to my stomach, actually, to think about that.
[03:38:06.340 --> 03:38:09.340]  We've learned so much about the body and health
[03:38:09.340 --> 03:38:11.340]  and I think we're all experts now.
[03:38:11.340 --> 03:38:14.340]  I swear, I think we're all really, really aware
[03:38:14.340 --> 03:38:16.340]  about where healthcare is going in this nation
[03:38:16.340 --> 03:38:20.340]  and what we need to do to actually be,
[03:38:20.340 --> 03:38:24.340]  I think, very aware ourselves on what we need to do for the body.
[03:38:24.340 --> 03:38:26.340]  I've talked about copper. I've talked about parasites.
[03:38:26.340 --> 03:38:29.340]  There are so many things that doctors will not talk about with you
[03:38:29.340 --> 03:38:31.340]  and these doctors will.
[03:38:31.340 --> 03:38:34.340]  These doctors will bring up the most important parts of healthcare,
[03:38:34.340 --> 03:38:35.340]  your health.
[03:38:35.340 --> 03:38:38.340]  So I really appreciate Dr. Simone Gold and all of her efforts.
[03:38:38.340 --> 03:38:41.340]  Let's talk about the Chinese balloon.
[03:38:41.340 --> 03:38:44.340]  Because I want to share with you some research that I did,
[03:38:44.340 --> 03:38:47.340]  some really important research because it reminded me
[03:38:47.340 --> 03:38:50.340]  of this research that I talked about about four years ago.
[03:38:50.340 --> 03:38:52.340]  But, you know, of course it wasn't.
[03:38:52.340 --> 03:38:54.340]  I don't think it was Chinese.
[03:38:54.340 --> 03:38:57.340]  They wanted you to see it and they immediately blamed it on the Chinese,
[03:38:57.340 --> 03:39:02.340]  which, you know, I love the meme that has the huge Chinese writing on it
[03:39:02.340 --> 03:39:06.340]  and it just says, gee, if we only had a clue about what it was.
[03:39:06.340 --> 03:39:08.340]  What did they do? Telescope in and it said,
[03:39:08.340 --> 03:39:11.340]  not spying on the balloon, you know.
[03:39:11.340 --> 03:39:17.340]  Anyway, so I, in the very beginning I was very skeptical of the story
[03:39:17.340 --> 03:39:22.340]  and then, of course, as it sails through and then it becomes a right-left paradigm.
[03:39:22.340 --> 03:39:24.340]  When it became a right-left paradigm,
[03:39:24.340 --> 03:39:26.340]  Biden, the administration, won't shoot it down.
[03:39:26.340 --> 03:39:29.340]  The fraudulent coup d'administration won't shoot it down
[03:39:29.340 --> 03:39:31.340]  and it became a left-right battle.
[03:39:31.340 --> 03:39:35.340]  I thought, we're in it even deeper because that is not what this is about.
[03:39:35.340 --> 03:39:37.340]  In fact, there were several things.
[03:39:37.340 --> 03:39:40.340]  They shot it down, didn't want to see what was in it, you know,
[03:39:40.340 --> 03:39:43.340]  that sort of thing, absolutely asinine and ridiculous, right?
[03:39:43.340 --> 03:39:45.340]  And how did they know it was Chinese?
[03:39:45.340 --> 03:39:47.340]  I mean, it's just absolutely ridiculous.
[03:39:47.340 --> 03:39:49.340]  We are in bed with China.
[03:39:49.340 --> 03:39:52.340]  So even if at this point China goes, yeah, that was ours,
[03:39:52.340 --> 03:39:56.340]  it doesn't even matter at this point because to have something like that fly,
[03:39:56.340 --> 03:40:00.340]  be flying around when they have satellites to pick up things,
[03:40:00.340 --> 03:40:02.340]  they don't need a spying balloon.
[03:40:02.340 --> 03:40:04.340]  So there were so many things, right?
[03:40:04.340 --> 03:40:07.340]  Too obvious, they wanted us to see it and then I thought, you know,
[03:40:07.340 --> 03:40:09.340]  they want us to look weak.
[03:40:09.340 --> 03:40:13.340]  One of the big objectives, if you really look at the WEF,
[03:40:13.340 --> 03:40:16.340]  is the fact that they really want digital currency to come in.
[03:40:16.340 --> 03:40:18.340]  So how do they do that?
[03:40:18.340 --> 03:40:20.340]  How do they do it effectively and get us to buy it,
[03:40:20.340 --> 03:40:23.340]  that there was some sort of hack that brings in our digital currency
[03:40:23.340 --> 03:40:26.340]  and hack in the banking system to throw everything off kilter, right?
[03:40:26.340 --> 03:40:29.340]  So they can provide a solution.
[03:40:29.340 --> 03:40:32.340]  And of course, the solution is digital currency.
[03:40:32.340 --> 03:40:36.340]  So if they do this in May or June, which is kind of rumored to be,
[03:40:36.340 --> 03:40:38.340]  then they have to make us look really weak.
[03:40:38.340 --> 03:40:42.340]  So they have to make it look like another country can fly a balloon
[03:40:42.340 --> 03:40:44.340]  and capture information, right?
[03:40:44.340 --> 03:40:47.340]  And they have to make it look like our airlines are being hacked
[03:40:47.340 --> 03:40:50.340]  and we have all these sudden problems coming.
[03:40:50.340 --> 03:40:54.340]  And lo and behold, after I said that, on Monday,
[03:40:54.340 --> 03:40:58.340]  the Pentagon came out and said, oh, we're just so weak.
[03:40:58.340 --> 03:41:01.340]  Oh my gosh, we just didn't see the undetectable.
[03:41:01.340 --> 03:41:07.340]  Honey, a cell phone in Montana could capture a footage of a balloon in the sky.
[03:41:07.340 --> 03:41:09.340]  What do you mean undetectable?
[03:41:09.340 --> 03:41:11.340]  I mean, no one's actually believing that, right?
[03:41:11.340 --> 03:41:14.340]  But the Pentagon's so stupid, they would actually come out with an article
[03:41:14.340 --> 03:41:18.340]  that says, yo, we couldn't detect it with all of our, you know, satellites.
[03:41:18.340 --> 03:41:22.340]  And so basically, we're supposed to believe this horse crap.
[03:41:22.340 --> 03:41:27.340]  And then on top of it, they finally shoot it down, but over the ocean.
[03:41:27.340 --> 03:41:32.340]  It reminds me of when they really sort of fake Lee got Osama in 2012
[03:41:32.340 --> 03:41:36.340]  to boost Obama's ratings for a second term, you know, to get elected again.
[03:41:36.340 --> 03:41:38.340]  And then claim that they buried his body at sea.
[03:41:38.340 --> 03:41:40.340]  No one actually believes that either, right?
[03:41:40.340 --> 03:41:41.340]  I hope not.
[03:41:41.340 --> 03:41:43.340]  Anyway, so back to this balloon.
[03:41:43.340 --> 03:41:44.340]  They want us to look weak.
[03:41:44.340 --> 03:41:48.340]  They want us to look vulnerable so that when they do digital currency,
[03:41:48.340 --> 03:41:51.340]  they can see see we just didn't do enough to shore up our nation.
[03:41:51.340 --> 03:41:52.340]  We're so weak.
[03:41:52.340 --> 03:41:57.340]  Oh, and I think that's, I think that's one of the components of this.
[03:41:57.340 --> 03:41:58.340]  It's going to be continuous.
[03:41:58.340 --> 03:42:01.340]  And this is why they let it fly and fly and fly and didn't say anything.
[03:42:01.340 --> 03:42:03.340]  And then, of course, they debated it.
[03:42:03.340 --> 03:42:06.340]  And then, of course, they waited by that time, you know,
[03:42:06.340 --> 03:42:09.340]  at the end of it to make sure they could shoot it down over the ocean
[03:42:09.340 --> 03:42:11.340]  so we could never see what was in it, right?
[03:42:11.340 --> 03:42:12.340]  What a joke.
[03:42:12.340 --> 03:42:16.340]  But when I come back, I want to tell you about what they said in 2019,
[03:42:16.340 --> 03:42:20.340]  because it's really, really important to understand where we're at
[03:42:20.340 --> 03:42:27.340]  with these, this type of balloon and that that balloon is very much ours.
[03:42:27.340 --> 03:42:31.340]  So I will come back and talk about that, but looking vulnerable.
[03:42:31.340 --> 03:42:35.340]  Oh, yeah, they want us to look very vulnerable and they'll keep building the story
[03:42:35.340 --> 03:42:39.340]  just like the Pentagon did on Monday with their asinine statements of,
[03:42:39.340 --> 03:42:40.340]  gee, we just couldn't see it.
[03:42:40.340 --> 03:42:43.340]  I know you guys could with your cell phone, but we couldn't.
[03:42:43.340 --> 03:42:44.340]  So it's, it's asinine, right?
[03:42:44.340 --> 03:42:45.340]  No one believes it.
[03:42:45.340 --> 03:42:47.340]  I would hope unless I don't know.
[03:42:47.340 --> 03:42:48.340]  You're dumb as a door now.
[03:42:48.340 --> 03:42:49.340]  Anyway, we'll be right back.
[03:42:49.340 --> 03:42:51.340]  I'll be right back on the Alex Jones show.
[03:42:51.340 --> 03:42:52.340]  Don't go anywhere.
[03:42:56.340 --> 03:42:58.340]  The cavalry has arrived.
[03:42:58.340 --> 03:43:05.340]  Ultimate bone broth is the strongest, highest quality chicken based bone broth.

[03:43:14.340 --> 03:43:18.340]  Well, this is concentrated chicken broth, the strongest out there with
[03:43:18.340 --> 03:43:22.340]  chocolate mushroom and a whole bunch of other ingredients like turmeric.
[03:43:22.340 --> 03:43:23.340]  The list goes on and on.

[03:43:28.340 --> 03:43:30.340]  supports the M4, a 360 win.
[03:43:30.340 --> 03:43:34.340]  If you've not experienced bone broth and even the regular ones have great effects,

[03:44:21.340 --> 03:44:25.340]  On the horse was named Death.
[03:44:29.340 --> 03:44:34.340]  Now the translation is, I looked and behold a pale horse,
[03:44:34.340 --> 03:44:40.340]  and his name that sat on him was Death and Hell followed with him.
[03:44:40.340 --> 03:44:43.340]  Book of Revelation.
[03:44:43.340 --> 03:44:46.340]  Very serious times to be alive folks, they're not just doing this as a one-off.
[03:44:46.340 --> 03:44:49.340]  This is the beginning of the rest of our lives, this is our fight,
[03:44:49.340 --> 03:44:51.340]  and I'm proud of humanity.
[03:44:51.340 --> 03:44:54.340]  The globalists even admit it's leaked, they're very upset that they're losing
[03:44:54.340 --> 03:44:57.340]  and that this hasn't gone the way they thought it would.
[03:44:57.340 --> 03:45:01.340]  I talk a lot about the great successes M4 Wars has had.
[03:45:01.340 --> 03:45:07.340]  I don't think anybody can deny it, and it is because of listeners and viewers supporting us.
[03:45:07.340 --> 03:45:12.340]  When we talk about the crew at M4 Wars, people behind the scenes, the researchers, the riders,
[03:45:12.340 --> 03:45:16.340]  they really have been the MVPs in this fight.
[03:45:16.340 --> 03:45:20.340]  When we look at Harrison Smith and Owen Troyer and the hard work they engage in every day,
[03:45:20.340 --> 03:45:24.340]  five, six, seven days a week, it's really just incredible.
[03:45:24.340 --> 03:45:28.340]  So for myself, the whole M4 Wars crew, I thank you for your past support.
[03:45:28.340 --> 03:45:34.340]  I only encourage you now to realize that M4 Wars cannot stay on air if you do not support us.
[03:45:34.340 --> 03:45:37.340]  I know you spread the word, I know you pray for us, and that's wonderful, keep doing it.
[03:45:37.340 --> 03:45:41.340]  But most viewers and listeners never go to M4WarsTore.com
[03:45:41.340 --> 03:45:46.340]  and you never buy great products that enrich and empower your life, all at the same time, keep us on air.
[03:45:46.340 --> 03:45:50.340]  I know that less than 1% of our listeners actually go buy products at M4WarsTore.com.
[03:45:50.340 --> 03:45:55.340]  If just 1% more of you took action at M4WarsTore.com, our fighting problems will be over.
[03:45:55.340 --> 03:45:56.340]  Please take action now.
[03:45:56.340 --> 03:46:02.340]  In the year 2000, Alex Jones' film Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove
[03:46:02.340 --> 03:46:09.340]  showed the world how our so-called elite leaders practice mock ritual sacrifices in private.
[03:46:09.340 --> 03:46:11.340]  Summer sets us free.
[03:46:11.340 --> 03:46:15.340]  In 2007, Alex Jones releases Endgame,
[03:46:15.340 --> 03:46:22.340]  exposing the world elite's plans for covertly using biological weapons against all of mankind.
[03:46:22.340 --> 03:46:25.340]  And by the time they launched their attack in 2020,
[03:46:25.340 --> 03:46:34.340]  Alex Jones' Info Wars and our audience were there to warn the people of the deadly vaccines that we knew were coming.
[03:46:34.340 --> 03:46:36.340]  This is why they attack us.
[03:46:36.340 --> 03:46:38.340]  This is why we need your support.
[03:46:38.340 --> 03:46:42.340]  Because we tell the truth, Alex Jones was right.
[03:46:42.340 --> 03:46:48.340]  Join the resistance, buy products, donate to the cause, share the leaks,
[03:46:48.340 --> 03:47:11.340]  join us in the fight for freedom and help us defeat the New World Order.
[03:47:11.340 --> 03:47:13.340]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:13.340 --> 03:47:14.340]  So happy to be here.
[03:47:14.340 --> 03:47:17.340]  I'm Kate Daly, your guest host from KateDalyRadio.com.
[03:47:17.340 --> 03:47:20.340]  All right, a couple of things. Let's go nuts and bolts here.
[03:47:20.340 --> 03:47:25.340]  As far as research goes, when they were blaming it on China right away,
[03:47:25.340 --> 03:47:31.340]  it reminded me of 9-11 when they immediately knew exactly who did it within about three seconds.
[03:47:31.340 --> 03:47:34.340]  That always cracks me up when they do that.
[03:47:34.340 --> 03:47:36.340]  No investigation necessary.
[03:47:36.340 --> 03:47:38.340]  And of course, they didn't blame it on Russia,
[03:47:38.340 --> 03:47:42.340]  which would have made more sense right now with the money laundering going on in Ukraine
[03:47:42.340 --> 03:47:44.340]  and then, of course, the whole Russia tale.
[03:47:44.340 --> 03:47:46.340]  So that would have actually made more sense.
[03:47:46.340 --> 03:47:49.340]  But of course, they had to blame it on China.
[03:47:49.340 --> 03:47:54.340]  So making us look weak from different angles, different countries, that makes sense to me.
[03:47:54.340 --> 03:47:56.340]  Same reason they blamed the whole China disease.
[03:47:56.340 --> 03:47:59.340]  I don't believe that. I actually don't believe that.
[03:47:59.340 --> 03:48:02.340]  We were so in bed with China, coordinated the efforts with COVID,
[03:48:02.340 --> 03:48:05.340]  used them as a scapegoat so that we could actually say,
[03:48:05.340 --> 03:48:07.340]  oh, it was done in China, so it's a China.
[03:48:07.340 --> 03:48:10.340]  China wanted to get back at us. China wanted to do this to us.
[03:48:10.340 --> 03:48:12.340]  I don't believe that for a hot minute.
[03:48:12.340 --> 03:48:14.340]  I believe that the CDC was at the helm the entire time,
[03:48:14.340 --> 03:48:17.340]  and I believe that to carry it out,
[03:48:17.340 --> 03:48:24.340]  they just used their little station over in China to actually start it
[03:48:24.340 --> 03:48:27.340]  and have a starting point that was not the USA.
[03:48:27.340 --> 03:48:29.340]  That's what I believe.
[03:48:29.340 --> 03:48:33.340]  So when I was looking back at some research, it was interesting.
[03:48:33.340 --> 03:48:38.340]  In 2019, I covered a story, Persistent Surveillance Systems by Lockheed Martin.
[03:48:38.340 --> 03:48:43.340]  In 2019, they came out with the Southern Border Tethered Aerostat Radar System TARS,
[03:48:43.340 --> 03:48:47.340]  all TARS were equipped and integrated, of course, with Lockheed Martin.
[03:48:47.340 --> 03:48:50.340]  They're the government. I mean, obviously we know that, right?
[03:48:50.340 --> 03:48:52.340]  They're not a separate entity. They just work with the government.
[03:48:52.340 --> 03:48:56.340]  So they're L88 Wide Area Surveillance Radar,
[03:48:56.340 --> 03:49:02.340]  and they said it was the largest aerostat system in daily operation in the United States,
[03:49:02.340 --> 03:49:08.340]  and that this system used helium for deployment as heights for 10,000 to 12,000 feet,
[03:49:08.340 --> 03:49:14.340]  and it allowed long-range radars to overcome the line-of-sight constraints
[03:49:14.340 --> 03:49:18.340]  caused by the curvature of the Earth and other terrain limitations, their words.
[03:49:18.340 --> 03:49:21.340]  The aerostats were tethered to a winch system,
[03:49:21.340 --> 03:49:28.340]  and what had happened was they basically began the aerostat program in 1978,
[03:49:28.340 --> 03:49:31.340]  and then the U.S. Air Force expanded it in the 80s.
[03:49:31.340 --> 03:49:35.340]  So that probably means it happened way earlier, because you know how they lie,
[03:49:35.340 --> 03:49:40.340]  but they provided monitoring capabilities to several federal agencies.
[03:49:40.340 --> 03:49:43.340]  Monitoring, that's what they called it. Yeah, that's just straight-up spying.
[03:49:43.340 --> 03:49:47.340]  And so in 2013, they went even with more operations,
[03:49:47.340 --> 03:49:55.340]  and then, of course, in 2019, basically just put it on steroids.
[03:49:55.340 --> 03:49:59.340]  And so I think it's our system, and it's part of a global system,
[03:49:59.340 --> 03:50:04.340]  especially in the Five Eyes system, the five countries that we're a part of,
[03:50:04.340 --> 03:50:08.340]  and I think it's just basically gathering data.
[03:50:08.340 --> 03:50:11.340]  It's gathering data, and they had to blame it on something else,
[03:50:11.340 --> 03:50:15.340]  because that storyline works to make us look very, very weak.
[03:50:15.340 --> 03:50:17.340]  That's what I think.
[03:50:17.340 --> 03:50:20.340]  And so, of course, they just had to name it the Chinese thing.
[03:50:20.340 --> 03:50:25.340]  So in 2019, if you can go Google this, the Pentagon came out
[03:50:25.340 --> 03:50:27.340]  and we're talking about their surveillance systems
[03:50:27.340 --> 03:50:31.340]  and how much they wanted to ramp it up, basically.
[03:50:31.340 --> 03:50:34.340]  And they did, didn't they? And we're going to see more of them.
[03:50:34.340 --> 03:50:37.340]  I'll probably blame them on other countries, who knows.
[03:50:37.340 --> 03:50:39.340]  But here's the thing.
[03:50:39.340 --> 03:50:42.340]  There's a couple of things that I want you to know about that are important right now,
[03:50:42.340 --> 03:50:47.340]  and there's social media bills being represented in legislatures across the country.
[03:50:47.340 --> 03:50:50.340]  These social media bills are really dangerous.
[03:50:50.340 --> 03:50:53.340]  I know that nationally they're trying to do this as well.
[03:50:53.340 --> 03:50:57.340]  The social media bills, what people don't understand about the social media thing with kids
[03:50:57.340 --> 03:51:00.340]  and keeping kids from cell phones in the classroom.
[03:51:00.340 --> 03:51:03.340]  Now, as a parent, you probably go, yeah, that's a really good idea.
[03:51:03.340 --> 03:51:08.340]  I would think so too, except for the fact that they're really pushing this hard, right?
[03:51:08.340 --> 03:51:11.340]  Lots of focus on TikTok, all of a sudden, by our government.
[03:51:11.340 --> 03:51:16.340]  Why is our government so overwhelmed by TikTok?
[03:51:16.340 --> 03:51:17.340]  There's a reason.
[03:51:17.340 --> 03:51:23.340]  And the kid that was on the bus beating up the little girl, whoever raised that kid,
[03:51:23.340 --> 03:51:27.340]  oh my gosh, anyway, it was horrifying to watch that, right?
[03:51:27.340 --> 03:51:30.340]  And what did the school district come out and say?
[03:51:30.340 --> 03:51:32.340]  Oh, their use of social media.
[03:51:32.340 --> 03:51:36.340]  They weren't really condemning the attack, the assault, as much as they were people filming it.
[03:51:36.340 --> 03:51:39.340]  Which, of course, you don't want to see people film like that.
[03:51:39.340 --> 03:51:41.340]  I mean, they didn't step in to help.
[03:51:41.340 --> 03:51:45.340]  These other kids, I guess, weren't parented very well and didn't step in to help the little girl.
[03:51:45.340 --> 03:51:50.340]  But at the same time, there was a focus by the school district that I haven't seen before.
[03:51:50.340 --> 03:51:54.340]  They weren't saying zero tolerance like they usually do, which is a NASA 9 statement.
[03:51:54.340 --> 03:51:58.340]  What they were saying was, well, you know, kids in their social media.
[03:51:58.340 --> 03:52:04.340]  So there's a lot of focus on getting the social media bills passed in all the states and also federally.
[03:52:04.340 --> 03:52:06.340]  What it does is it robs your Fourth Amendment.
[03:52:06.340 --> 03:52:12.340]  It takes away your Fourth Amendment because you have to provide so much information on your child
[03:52:12.340 --> 03:52:17.340]  in order for the government to step in as the nanny, the parent, the baby daddy,
[03:52:17.340 --> 03:52:22.340]  and absolutely control the situation where kids could not have it in the public school system.
[03:52:22.340 --> 03:52:25.340]  So there's such an element of control here.
[03:52:25.340 --> 03:52:27.340]  It's how they carry it out.
[03:52:27.340 --> 03:52:29.340]  It's how they do it.
[03:52:29.340 --> 03:52:34.340]  That is absolutely appalling when it comes to violations of privacy
[03:52:34.340 --> 03:52:38.340]  and collecting even more data on you, your family, and your child.
[03:52:38.340 --> 03:52:40.340]  That's what's horrific about it.
[03:52:40.340 --> 03:52:44.340]  And as it's sailing through the states, you really need to stop this.
[03:52:44.340 --> 03:52:46.340]  They have enough information on our kids.
[03:52:46.340 --> 03:52:48.340]  They're already selling common core information.
[03:52:48.340 --> 03:52:52.340]  They've been doing this for years and years and years, the data on your kids.
[03:52:52.340 --> 03:53:00.340]  So we have to be able to understand that the fallout of that bill is government, government, government control.
[03:53:00.340 --> 03:53:05.340]  And you do not want the government to be the baby daddy, to be the nanny in this case.
[03:53:05.340 --> 03:53:08.340]  The government loves to come in and solve a problem.
[03:53:08.340 --> 03:53:09.340]  And we have way too much government.
[03:53:09.340 --> 03:53:10.340]  It's very tyrannical.
[03:53:10.340 --> 03:53:12.340]  I don't need to tell you that.
[03:53:12.340 --> 03:53:19.340]  But we are living in such a state of tyranny that to hand over more tyranny because an idea sounds nice.
[03:53:19.340 --> 03:53:21.340]  That's what the leftists do.
[03:53:21.340 --> 03:53:22.340]  This idea sounds good.
[03:53:22.340 --> 03:53:24.340]  Emotionally, I'm on board.
[03:53:24.340 --> 03:53:26.340]  They don't even care about rights.
[03:53:26.340 --> 03:53:31.340]  They do not care that the Constitution is being violated in any way, shape, or form if it sounds good.
[03:53:31.340 --> 03:53:34.340]  But that's about the intelligence of a leftist.
[03:53:34.340 --> 03:53:35.340]  They don't understand.
[03:53:35.340 --> 03:53:37.340]  On the right, we have the same problem.
[03:53:37.340 --> 03:53:43.340]  We have good intentions, but we have the same problem in saying, when is government too much government?
[03:53:43.340 --> 03:53:45.340]  What are we doing here?
[03:53:45.340 --> 03:53:48.340]  And obviously not right on many, many accounts.
[03:53:48.340 --> 03:53:52.340]  Please fight these social media bills because of the invasion of the Fourth Amendment.
[03:53:52.340 --> 03:53:55.340]  We already have too much NSA spying.
[03:53:55.340 --> 03:53:58.340]  We already have too much data being collected.
[03:53:58.340 --> 03:54:01.340]  Don't hand them over more because an idea sounds good.
[03:54:01.340 --> 03:54:06.340]  We just need really good parenting that says, honey, you're not taking your phone to school or stay off your phone.
[03:54:06.340 --> 03:54:10.340]  Stay off your phone in the classroom or whatever the case may be.
[03:54:10.340 --> 03:54:11.340]  We need good parents.
[03:54:11.340 --> 03:54:12.340]  That's what we need.
[03:54:12.340 --> 03:54:17.340]  The other thing I wanted to tell you about really quick was I talked with Susan Schwartz,
[03:54:17.340 --> 03:54:23.340]  who is over at Right to Life League, the longest running pro-life legal group.
[03:54:23.340 --> 03:54:24.340]  And they're awesome.
[03:54:24.340 --> 03:54:25.340]  They're in California.
[03:54:25.340 --> 03:54:30.340]  And let me tell you what this administration, this fraudulent King Fraudelot administration,
[03:54:30.340 --> 03:54:32.340]  by the way, he does look like a droid.
[03:54:32.340 --> 03:54:42.340]  Anyway, this administration is basically what they're doing is allowing for chemical drugs to be dispersed at the pharmacy level
[03:54:42.340 --> 03:54:44.340]  without ever having to see a doctor.
[03:54:44.340 --> 03:54:50.340]  Usually if a woman wants to murder her baby, you actually have to go into the clinic and you have to be seen by somebody
[03:54:50.340 --> 03:54:57.340]  to actually get the gestation of that baby because you can't be given those drugs too far into the pregnancy
[03:54:57.340 --> 03:55:02.340]  or they can be super, super harmful and cause death and a number of things to happen to a woman.
[03:55:02.340 --> 03:55:08.340]  But now what they're doing is, I know there's a lot of women that are running around their little combat boots
[03:55:08.340 --> 03:55:12.340]  with their little vagina hat on their head screaming that they can't murder their child quick enough
[03:55:12.340 --> 03:55:14.340]  or they don't have access to murder.
[03:55:14.340 --> 03:55:19.340]  But the case is, they actually have it easier right now because of COVID,
[03:55:19.340 --> 03:55:23.340]  they said all you have to do is basically drive through your pharmacy window,
[03:55:23.340 --> 03:55:28.340]  grab your chemical drugs because the pharmacies are now allowed to write the scripts for those.
[03:55:28.340 --> 03:55:30.340]  The pharmacy doesn't even have to look at you.
[03:55:30.340 --> 03:55:34.340]  You can claim, oh, I'm nine weeks because over 10 weeks there's a problem.
[03:55:34.340 --> 03:55:38.340]  I'm eight weeks, I'm nine weeks and a doctor never even looks at you.
[03:55:38.340 --> 03:55:40.340]  So women actually have it easier.
[03:55:40.340 --> 03:55:45.340]  So don't buy the whole story about we can't murder our babies now, woe is dust,
[03:55:45.340 --> 03:55:47.340]  like Amy Schumer and her asinine commercial.
[03:55:47.340 --> 03:55:51.340]  Come to Colorado so you can murder your baby, that kind of thing.
[03:55:51.340 --> 03:55:53.340]  Don't buy into it.
[03:55:53.340 --> 03:55:56.340]  It's a total lie because they actually just made it easier to do,
[03:55:56.340 --> 03:55:58.340]  which is really pathetic and evil.
[03:55:58.340 --> 03:56:07.340]  The satanic temple, of course, the big fight in the lawsuits about the satanic temple wanting to perform abortions.
[03:56:07.340 --> 03:56:10.340]  It's quite actually funny that they're trying to do this.
[03:56:10.340 --> 03:56:14.340]  My idea is that we only allow abortions in satanic temples.
[03:56:14.340 --> 03:56:20.340]  That way, as the girl walks in, they actually get to see what they're a part of.
[03:56:20.340 --> 03:56:25.340]  And if you have to go to a satanic temple to get an abortion, maybe you might rethink it, right?
[03:56:25.340 --> 03:56:32.340]  But this satanic temple that pretends to be a religion is fighting and fighting and fighting
[03:56:32.340 --> 03:56:37.340]  with the most asinine attorneys you've ever met who don't know what they're doing, thank goodness,
[03:56:37.340 --> 03:56:40.340]  to try to get abortions done at these satanic temples.
[03:56:40.340 --> 03:56:45.340]  But if you're a girl that has to walk into a satanic temple to do this,
[03:56:45.340 --> 03:56:51.340]  I sure hope the idea hits home that what you're doing just might be a little evil, you think?
[03:56:51.340 --> 03:56:55.340]  Anyway, I just wanted to let everybody know what's going on in our pharmacies
[03:56:55.340 --> 03:56:58.340]  because I don't think people realize this.
[03:56:58.340 --> 03:57:01.340]  And I thought this was great information coming out of Right to Life League,
[03:57:01.340 --> 03:57:03.340]  and they're trying to fight this.
[03:57:03.340 --> 03:57:04.340]  You can fight this in your state.
[03:57:04.340 --> 03:57:06.340]  Cassantis is fighting this in Florida.
[03:57:06.340 --> 03:57:12.340]  And so I know my own state probably won't because we're weak and we have a despicable governor.
[03:57:12.340 --> 03:57:18.340]  But I know that many states will not lick the Biden boots and basically make sure
[03:57:18.340 --> 03:57:24.340]  that they are not making it even easier to have these abortions by just going to your local pharmacy
[03:57:24.340 --> 03:57:25.340]  and getting it done.
[03:57:25.340 --> 03:57:27.340]  It just makes you sick, doesn't it?
[03:57:27.340 --> 03:57:31.340]  I hate to end on that, but there's just so many things to be aware of right now
[03:57:31.340 --> 03:57:34.340]  that are happening that we're just straight up lied to about.
[03:57:34.340 --> 03:57:35.340]  And I know you know that.
[03:57:35.340 --> 03:57:37.340]  But I'm so grateful to spend this hour with you.
[03:57:37.340 --> 03:57:42.340]  Big thank you to Dr. Simone Gold and thank you for tuning into The Alex Jones Show.
[03:57:42.340 --> 03:57:46.340]  Really appreciate you guys.
[03:57:46.340 --> 03:57:49.340]  Infowars secret weapon is finally here.
[03:57:49.340 --> 03:57:53.340]  It's a secret weapon for your immune system, for your stamina, for your energy,
[03:57:53.340 --> 03:57:55.340]  for your way of life, for your libido.
[03:57:55.340 --> 03:57:58.340]  And it also keeps Infowars on the air.
[03:57:58.340 --> 03:58:04.340]  And I almost forgot you save at least 50% on these products for what you pay
[03:58:04.340 --> 03:58:08.340]  for similar products or the exact same products in stores around the country.
[03:58:08.340 --> 03:58:11.340]  That's because we go right to the highest quality manufacturer in the nation
[03:58:11.340 --> 03:58:13.340]  that supplies some of the top names.
[03:58:13.340 --> 03:58:16.340]  They then give us the best deal out there because the owner is a listener
[03:58:16.340 --> 03:58:18.340]  and we're able to bring it to you with massive discounts.
[03:58:18.340 --> 03:58:23.340]  You're not going to find 1,000 milligram high quality CBD for anywhere near the price we sell it.
[03:58:23.340 --> 03:58:26.340]  You're not going to find it at the 10 milligram or the 20 milligram.
[03:58:26.340 --> 03:58:30.340]  You're not going to find two-market 95% of humanoid at the price we're selling it.
[03:58:30.340 --> 03:58:32.340]  You're not going to find any of this anywhere near that.
[03:58:32.340 --> 03:58:38.340]  These similar formulas or the same formulas sell for up to 200% more than we're selling these.
[03:58:38.340 --> 03:59:03.340]  Infowars MD, now available exclusively at infowarstore.com, a true 361.
[03:59:03.340 --> 03:59:09.340]  And it's the same PSYOP today. Infowars is more influential and more powerful than ever
[03:59:09.340 --> 03:59:13.340]  because of your support and because of the facts that we've covered is coming true.
[03:59:13.340 --> 03:59:18.340]  But if they can convince you we've been shut down, if they can convince you that we're going away
[03:59:18.340 --> 03:59:22.340]  and you stop supporting, you stop spreading the word, then they do win.
[03:59:22.340 --> 03:59:26.340]  Ladies and gentlemen, there's only one group of people that can shut down Infowars
[03:59:26.340 --> 03:59:28.340]  and that's you, the viewers and listeners.

[03:59:30.340 --> 03:59:34.340]  If you decide to go to infowarstore.com and get supplements and books and films and t-shirts
[03:59:34.340 --> 03:59:37.340]  and so much more, we will stay on the air indefinitely.
[03:59:37.340 --> 03:59:39.340]  It is all in your hands.
[03:59:39.340 --> 03:59:41.340]  So thanks for your support. Stand up against the globalists.
[03:59:41.340 --> 04:00:05.340]  Go to infowarstore.com right now and keep us on air. It's up to you.
