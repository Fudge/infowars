[00:00:16.254 --> 00:00:17.356]  InfoWars.
[00:00:17.356 --> 00:00:18.537]  Tomorrow's news.
[00:00:18.537 --> 00:00:18.958]  Today.
[00:00:27.699 --> 00:00:33.264]  Why would anyone think that our corrupt government sees Communist China as an enemy?
[00:00:33.264 --> 00:00:37.107]  They have been close partners for over 50 years.
[00:00:37.107 --> 00:00:51.901]  In 1971, after Mao Zedong spent years calling for the invasion of America, Henry Kissinger, acting as President Nixon's special representative, secretly traveled to Beijing to open business relations with the CCP.
[00:00:52.761 --> 00:00:53.762]  George H.W.
[00:00:53.762 --> 00:00:57.204]  Bush then went to China as the director of the U.S.
[00:00:57.204 --> 00:01:04.269]  Liaison Office and paved the way for multinational outsourcing of America's labor markets.
[00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:06.511]  Fast forward to 2001.
[00:01:06.511 --> 00:01:12.655]  The inside job of taking down the Twin Towers accomplished many things for the corrupt U.S.
[00:01:12.655 --> 00:01:13.556]  government.
[00:01:13.556 --> 00:01:20.881]  It was the Pearl Harbor event that the neocons wrote they needed to launch their plan for a new American century.
[00:01:21.381 --> 00:01:27.506]  It was the catalyst for the Patriot Act, which is being used today to target American patriots.
[00:01:27.506 --> 00:01:31.750]  And it was a way to account for trillions of missing dollars.
[00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:35.072]  On the afternoon of September 10, 2001, U.S.
[00:01:35.072 --> 00:01:43.719]  Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld announced that the Pentagon was unable to account for $2.3 trillion.
[00:01:43.719 --> 00:01:47.963]  The technology revolution has transformed organizations across the private sector.
[00:01:49.232 --> 00:01:53.355]  But not ours, not fully, not yet.
[00:01:53.355 --> 00:01:58.979]  We are, as they say, tangled in our anchor chain.
[00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:01.420]  Our financial systems are decades old.
[00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:07.024]  According to some estimates, we cannot track 2.3 trillion dollars in transactions.
[00:02:07.024 --> 00:02:13.909]  The very next day, on 9-11, the Pentagon's budget offices took a direct hit and was destroyed.
[00:02:14.549 --> 00:02:23.156]  The markets closed for two weeks, banks all across the nation were closed, and the missing $2.3 trillion was forgotten.
[00:02:23.156 --> 00:02:33.605]  With overwhelming evidence of 9-11 being a series of controlled demolitions, the debris and wreckage from the felled towers was not investigated.
[00:02:33.605 --> 00:02:36.628]  Instead, it was immediately shipped off to China.
[00:02:37.208 --> 00:02:43.011]  And on December 11th of that same year, China became a member of the World Trade Organization.
[00:02:43.011 --> 00:02:51.716]  Having been given favorable trading status by the U.S., the CCP was virtually exempt from violating human rights violations.
[00:02:51.716 --> 00:02:59.400]  And millions of Americans began losing their jobs as manufacturing was outsourced to CCP slave labor factories.
[00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:02.723]  Fast forward to the current era.
[00:03:02.723 --> 00:03:18.940]  Our government worked with the Communist Chinese to weaponize COVID-19 and to further destabilize the American economy with forced lockdowns and deadly experimental vaccines that are still killing people to this day, including children.
[00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:20.200]  The U.S.
[00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:30.346]  Bureau of Labor Statistics desperately publishes a fake jobs report claiming over 500,000 jobs when the actual numbers are more like 80,000.
[00:03:30.346 --> 00:03:34.349]  The housing market is collapsing.
[00:03:34.349 --> 00:03:37.411]  41% of small businesses can't pay their rent.
[00:03:37.411 --> 00:03:37.991]  The U.S.
[00:03:37.991 --> 00:03:40.833]  debt is at $31 trillion.
[00:03:40.833 --> 00:03:45.235]  The Federal Reserve Bank is backed into a corner and the crooked U.S.
[00:03:45.235 --> 00:03:47.036]  government needs another 9-11.
[00:03:48.357 --> 00:03:56.820]  And right on cue, a giant balloon, big enough to be seen by all, slowly creeps across the American skies.
[00:03:56.820 --> 00:04:00.961]  The average American is now talking about EMPs.
[00:04:00.961 --> 00:04:06.483]  Our government's partner, the CCP, takes credit, and a new Bin Laden is born.
[00:04:06.983 --> 00:04:21.055]  The stage is now set for an EMP attack so that the banks have an excuse to close, steal the rest of America's wealth, making way for the CCP's digital yuan to become the new world reserve currency.
[00:04:21.055 --> 00:04:22.757]  They are probing us everywhere, Martha.
[00:04:22.757 --> 00:04:25.659]  They're probing us in the Pacific with their fighter aircraft.
[00:04:25.659 --> 00:04:28.202]  We had a close incident not too many weeks ago.
[00:04:28.202 --> 00:04:30.744]  They're probing us in our home by putting propaganda on TikTok.
[00:04:31.264 --> 00:04:32.764]  Poisoning our children.
[00:04:32.764 --> 00:04:34.245]  They're working in our schools and universities.
[00:04:34.245 --> 00:04:38.346]  This is just another example of the Chinese Communist Party's aggression.
[00:04:38.346 --> 00:04:44.007]  Why would anyone think that our government is enemies with the Communist Chinese?
[00:04:44.007 --> 00:04:47.888]  Reporting for InfoWars, this is Greg Reese.
[00:04:47.888 --> 00:04:49.448]  All right, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:04:49.448 --> 00:04:50.168]  We're live.
[00:04:50.168 --> 00:04:52.509]  It's February 8th on this Wednesday edition, 2023.
[00:04:52.509 --> 00:04:56.270]  And Greg Reese is absolutely right.
[00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:57.630]  Globalists need a new 9-11.
[00:05:01.058 --> 00:05:11.047]  The good news is, the Real Red Pill Plus, after over two years being sold out because the key ingredients were unavailable with supply chain breakdowns, is finally back in stock in the last month.
[00:05:11.047 --> 00:05:14.770]  The bad news is, we need a limited run of it, and it's almost sold out.
[00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:17.132]  So, we're in late January when I'm cutting this.
[00:05:17.132 --> 00:05:22.217]  Only seven days left to get the Real Red Pill Plus with all the key ingredients, like Preglanone and more,
[00:05:22.677 --> 00:05:26.000]  At InfoWarsTore.com for 50% off.
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.922]  Whether you're old or young, black or white, it doesn't matter.
[00:05:28.922 --> 00:05:31.705]  You need to experience Real Red Pill Plus.
[00:05:31.705 --> 00:05:33.046]  It's proprietary.
[00:05:33.046 --> 00:05:33.686]  It's amazing.
[00:05:33.686 --> 00:05:39.031]  I learned about it from a research scientist and a medical doctor who had a similar formula five years ago.
[00:05:39.031 --> 00:05:42.153]  We simply made it stronger and we have great reviews from listeners.
[00:05:42.153 --> 00:05:44.535]  Get the Real Red Pill Plus for a limited time.
[00:05:44.535 --> 00:05:47.177]  It's about to end at InfoWarsTore.com for 50% off.
[00:05:48.078 --> 00:05:51.700]  You need to try the Real Red Pill Plus right now, plus it funds the InfoWar.
[00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:53.602]  The only way we fail is if we don't take action.
[00:05:53.602 --> 00:06:02.167]  Real Red Pill Plus, now available at 50% off at InfoWarStore.com for only a few more days.
[00:06:02.167 --> 00:06:07.091]  It's Wednesday, February 8th, 2023.
[00:06:14.162 --> 00:06:22.225]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[00:06:22.225 --> 00:06:34.430]  Well, the New World Order and all the horrible things it's done to us, and all the even more terrible things it's got planned for us, is out in the open.
[00:06:34.430 --> 00:06:38.552]  Well, I did not watch the State of the Union by the puppet president last night live.
[00:06:39.465 --> 00:06:41.246]  But I got up at about 4 a.m.
[00:06:41.246 --> 00:07:02.396]  and I did watch it and all I can say is what a psyop Biden is putting a geriatric person with serious cognitive decline in the presidency and then walking him out there to act like the ringleader at a legendary clown show.
[00:07:03.786 --> 00:07:17.412]  And obviously we got a bunch of clips of it and we can laugh at it, but the joke's on us really at the end of the day that this is what they've done to us, this is what they've installed, this is how they're trying to sabotage civilization.
[00:07:17.412 --> 00:07:19.273]  Now we're going to be going over that.
[00:07:19.273 --> 00:07:27.976]  We're going to be going over the rollout of the Cashless Society and some big new UN developments and how they plan to roll it out here and around different parts of the world.
[00:07:27.976 --> 00:07:32.038]  We have Elon Musk coming out and saying it's not supposed to be real.
[00:07:33.328 --> 00:07:39.282]  Elon Musk highlights 20-year-old video game, Deus Ex, that predicted a globalist takeover.
[00:07:41.041 --> 00:07:49.068]  And what's interesting about this is the video game, and I guess several different versions, was produced and made in Austin, became a big underground hit.
[00:07:49.068 --> 00:07:52.550]  I remember talking 16 years ago or so to the makers of it.
[00:07:52.550 --> 00:07:57.955]  They were talking to me about being in another version, but I never really paid attention.
[00:07:57.955 --> 00:07:59.356]  It never really happened.
[00:07:59.356 --> 00:08:03.479]  But what's interesting is Elon Musk says, everybody else can come back on Twitter, but I can't.
[00:08:03.479 --> 00:08:08.583]  I'm the most evil person in the world ever, because the misrepresentations of the media of me questioning a mass shooting
[00:08:09.304 --> 00:08:15.007]  But then he basically is becoming the new Alex Jones with hundreds of billions of dollars.
[00:08:15.007 --> 00:08:17.388]  So, I'm in a paradox.
[00:08:17.388 --> 00:08:29.295]  I like a lot of the things Elon Musk is doing, but it's very, very strange to watch him hail a video game that the makers of which, you can pull this up, type in Alex Jones, Deus Ex.
[00:08:29.295 --> 00:08:35.318]  You can read articles with them 20 years ago saying it's inspired by a lot of people, but mainly Alex Jones.
[00:08:35.318 --> 00:08:38.540]  And then to see Elon Musk hailing the game, but
[00:08:40.478 --> 00:08:45.842]  Saying that the person that inspired the game is bad.
[00:08:45.842 --> 00:08:50.626]  Kind of feels like my identity is being taken or something.
[00:08:50.626 --> 00:08:59.012]  Because the media misrepresents who I am and what I stand for and what I've really said and creates a caricature.
[00:08:59.012 --> 00:08:59.893]  But then my work
[00:09:01.052 --> 00:09:10.735]  Of over 28 years is everywhere and having a great effect thanks to listeners and viewers that supported the broadcast and magnified the message and the information I had to put out.
[00:09:10.735 --> 00:09:19.858]  But to talk about the effect we've had together, it cannot be overestimated and it's been God working through us, so thank God for that.
[00:09:19.858 --> 00:09:25.060]  We've got really important poison COVID shot news.
[00:09:25.060 --> 00:09:26.400]  I say it every day, really.
[00:09:26.400 --> 00:09:27.800]  Every day the news just gets bigger.
[00:09:27.800 --> 00:09:29.101]  Who can deny that?
[00:09:29.101 --> 00:09:29.441]  Victory!
[00:09:30.512 --> 00:09:37.119]  California quietly drops COVID-19 vaccine mandate for school children.
[00:09:37.119 --> 00:09:39.381]  And then we'll go into the rest of the story.
[00:09:39.381 --> 00:09:46.129]  Thailand to ban Pfizer after the princess falls into coma following booster jab.
[00:09:46.129 --> 00:09:49.853]  The most vaccine hesitant group of all PhDs with medical degrees.
[00:09:51.516 --> 00:09:54.457]  Those stupid medical people, not wanting to take it.
[00:09:54.457 --> 00:09:57.179]  Microcarditis after mRNA vaccines explodes.
[00:09:57.179 --> 00:10:02.821]  9 out of 10 microcarditis cases now confirmed, connected to the shot.
[00:10:02.821 --> 00:10:04.402]  But don't worry, the Associated Press and the U.S.
[00:10:04.402 --> 00:10:10.024]  Military Intelligence have joined forces to discredit anyone who is pointing that out.
[00:10:10.024 --> 00:10:12.145]  That is the illegal PSYOP going on.
[00:10:12.145 --> 00:10:16.287]  And in Canada, it's passed the Senate and their Parliament.
[00:10:17.731 --> 00:10:27.218]  To have the government with PSYOP groups from their military control what you can see in live time, officially bringing them into 1984.
[00:10:27.218 --> 00:10:34.563]  We also have confirmed reports now that the Pentagon did know of several Chinese balloons that went over the country, and the media said Trump did nothing.
[00:10:34.563 --> 00:10:40.007]  They made the decision not to tell President Trump.
[00:10:40.007 --> 00:10:45.171]  So not his fault, their treasonous fault, as they set that precedent.
[00:10:45.171 --> 00:10:46.072]  Absolutely incredible.
[00:10:46.889 --> 00:10:59.579]  We have a lot of race war brainwashing news that I want to talk about today just as they turned women against men in the 50s, 60s, 70s and 80s with CIA run Gloria Steinem.
[00:10:59.579 --> 00:11:05.924]  Look it up, CIA ran an operation to turn women against men and men against women.
[00:11:05.924 --> 00:11:08.707]  It's the same type of psyop going on now and they're running
[00:11:09.912 --> 00:11:19.959]  News pieces around the country saying that if a school lunch program serves children that happen to be black, chicken, fried chicken, it's racist.
[00:11:19.959 --> 00:11:21.660]  Well, they eat some bugs, I'm sure that's better.
[00:11:21.660 --> 00:11:26.883]  It's just the way they take everything and weaponize it, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:11:26.883 --> 00:11:31.166]  That, oh, it's a weird northern trope, I guess, for northerners.
[00:11:31.166 --> 00:11:37.450]  I don't think it's northerners that never really ate fried chicken to think, oh, black people are moving up here and they eat fried chicken.
[00:11:37.450 --> 00:11:38.031]  They're weird.
[00:11:40.100 --> 00:11:42.902]  That's just a southern dish, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:11:42.902 --> 00:11:45.364]  But again, this is the black children.
[00:11:45.364 --> 00:11:46.205]  It's horrible.
[00:11:46.205 --> 00:11:51.749]  They served us fried chicken on the menu during Black History Month.
[00:11:51.749 --> 00:11:55.472]  We know it's a secret attack.
[00:11:55.472 --> 00:11:57.153]  Don't worry, they'll be feeding you bugs quick enough.
[00:11:57.153 --> 00:12:03.658]  You won't have to complain about fried chicken anymore.
[00:12:03.658 --> 00:12:04.799]  But it gets even worse.
[00:12:06.767 --> 00:12:12.668]  On the fruit menu of strawberries and grapes was also watermelon.
[00:12:12.668 --> 00:12:17.470]  Oh my goodness, and it gets even worse.
[00:12:17.470 --> 00:12:19.410]  Baked beans and a banana.
[00:12:19.410 --> 00:12:31.533]  You know, it's funny, when I saw that menu, I had been at a brunch with my wife and five-year-old daughter two weeks ago, and my daughter
[00:12:32.841 --> 00:12:44.948]  When she went through the brunch line with all the dozens of choices she chose, fried chicken, waffles and watermelon, which you know my five-year-old daughter did it to be mean to black people.
[00:12:44.948 --> 00:12:46.348]  She didn't want to eat waffles.
[00:12:46.348 --> 00:12:47.769]  She didn't want to eat fried chicken.
[00:12:47.769 --> 00:12:50.451]  She didn't want a piece of watermelon and grapes.
[00:12:50.451 --> 00:12:56.214]  No, ladies and gentlemen, she too was channeling Adolf Hitler.
[00:12:57.674 --> 00:13:06.198]  Meanwhile, they're injecting children of every color with deadly poison that destroys their fertility and massively increases their chances of cardiovascular disease.
[00:13:06.198 --> 00:13:08.139]  But that's liberal and loving.
[00:13:08.139 --> 00:13:11.281]  That's brought to you by Pfizer during the satanic Grammys.
[00:13:11.281 --> 00:13:13.422]  That's okay!
[00:13:13.422 --> 00:13:14.202]  So we've got a big stack.
[00:13:14.202 --> 00:13:15.743]  That's just one of the articles.
[00:13:15.743 --> 00:13:19.985]  I've got one of the newscasts about just the terribleness of the school.
[00:13:19.985 --> 00:13:26.708]  They're so sorry they were insensitive that they gave the school that's
[00:13:28.342 --> 00:13:29.903]  Has black students in it.
[00:13:29.903 --> 00:13:30.484]  Fried chicken.
[00:13:30.484 --> 00:13:32.746]  It's just folks.
[00:13:32.746 --> 00:13:42.274]  I mean, I'm calling on grocery stores in Austin, like H-E-B, to stop selling fried chicken at their counter, because it's popular, but it's secretly racist, too.
[00:13:42.274 --> 00:13:46.377]  And they sell watermelons in the produce department.
[00:13:46.377 --> 00:13:48.159]  And you can buy waffle mix, too.
[00:13:48.159 --> 00:13:48.980]  See?
[00:13:48.980 --> 00:13:53.664]  Man, this dog whistle of racism is everywhere.
[00:13:53.664 --> 00:13:55.065]  I call for banning watermelon.
[00:13:57.230 --> 00:14:07.900]  I call for banning fried chicken and baked beans, and just anything black people have ever eaten in their life, it's got to be banned right now.
[00:14:07.900 --> 00:14:15.246]  And again, that sounds ridiculous, this is ridiculous, but that's the level of mind control where they take all of our rights, put us all into slavery,
[00:14:16.144 --> 00:14:20.447]  Big government, the media, Disney, I've got the articles, are all promoting this.
[00:14:20.447 --> 00:14:23.909]  And you've got these hypersensitive, angry black people out there.
[00:14:23.909 --> 00:14:25.590]  The majority of black folks aren't buying into it.
[00:14:25.590 --> 00:14:37.638]  But I mean, we do see the folks on the news and the reports and just everywhere, really entitled, angry black people, particularly young black people, attacking their servers, attacking anybody.
[00:14:39.056 --> 00:14:44.678]  Believing they've been slighted in any way, and this is how they put a chip on people's shoulders.
[00:14:44.678 --> 00:14:54.941]  That's why we've got all these 40, 50, 60-year-old, 70-year-old feminist women who are dying alone at home with their cats because they were taught to hate men and never be around men.
[00:14:54.941 --> 00:15:00.823]  And by the time they get 45 or 50, they start desperately trying to get a man, but they can't.
[00:15:01.991 --> 00:15:02.952]  So they die alone.
[00:15:02.952 --> 00:15:03.572]  Mission completed.
[00:15:03.572 --> 00:15:17.163]  And it's the same thing, they're trying to handicap black people by putting chips on their shoulders so they act completely out of control like everybody's out to get them and then they can't work with anybody because they're so screwed up.
[00:15:17.163 --> 00:15:18.984]  This is how you bring down a society.
[00:15:18.984 --> 00:15:24.529]  And then they've got the five-year-olds being taught they're really a girl and they're a boy and vice versa.
[00:15:24.529 --> 00:15:26.250]  That's meant to sabotage society.
[00:15:26.250 --> 00:15:28.072]  The fentanyl's meant to sabotage society.
[00:15:29.161 --> 00:15:30.942]  Cutting off the energy spent to sabotage society.
[00:15:30.942 --> 00:15:44.251]  And look, I know the listeners of this show know that, but we've got to reach out to all these people under my control and say, listen, you're being jacked with really hard here, so that you'll be a complete loser independent on a system that wants to kill your ass.
[00:15:44.251 --> 00:15:46.952]  So we've got that news as well.
[00:15:46.952 --> 00:15:47.693]  So much more.
[00:15:47.693 --> 00:15:50.414]  This is going to be a big broadcast today.
[00:15:50.414 --> 00:15:51.735]  And I've cleared the deck of guests.
[00:15:51.735 --> 00:15:55.858]  We're going to take hour after hour of your amazing phone calls as well.
[00:15:55.858 --> 00:15:56.839]  I'll give the number out soon.
[00:15:56.839 --> 00:15:57.259]  Stay with us.
[00:16:01.624 --> 00:16:04.766]  I talk a lot about the great successes InfoWars has had.
[00:16:04.766 --> 00:16:07.048]  I don't think anybody can deny it.
[00:16:07.048 --> 00:16:10.991]  And it is because of listeners and viewers supporting us.
[00:16:10.991 --> 00:16:19.917]  When we talk about the crew at InfoWars, people behind the scenes, the researchers, the writers, they really have been the MVPs in this fight.
[00:16:19.917 --> 00:16:27.723]  And when you look at Harrison Smith and Owen Schroer and the hard work they engage in every day, five, six, seven days a week, it's really just incredible.
[00:16:28.729 --> 00:16:31.611]  So for myself and the whole InfoWars crew, I thank you for your past support.
[00:16:31.611 --> 00:16:38.157]  I only encourage you now to realize that InfoWars cannot stay on air if you do not support us.
[00:16:38.157 --> 00:16:41.199]  I know you spread the word, I know you pray for us, and that's wonderful, keep doing it.
[00:16:41.199 --> 00:16:48.245]  But most viewers and listeners, never go to InfoWarsStore.com, and you never buy great products that enrich and empower your life.
[00:16:48.245 --> 00:16:49.426]  All at the same time, keep us on air.
[00:16:50.326 --> 00:16:51.487]  There is a war on for your mind.
[00:16:51.487 --> 00:16:52.528]  Your mind is a battlefield.
[00:16:52.528 --> 00:16:53.368]  This is an information war.
[00:17:06.417 --> 00:17:11.103]  InfoWars popularized those terms more than two decades ago.
[00:17:11.103 --> 00:17:20.315]  And today, whether it's Donald Trump, or Governor DeSantis, or Dr. Robert Malone, they're all using the terms that InfoWars has popularized.
[00:17:20.315 --> 00:17:23.560]  Because we understand the enemy's operations, and we know how to beat them.
[00:17:23.960 --> 00:17:25.603]  But we can't do it without funding.
[00:17:25.603 --> 00:17:31.210]  And we make it easy to fund, with great products that empower you and your immune system, and your family as well.
[00:17:31.210 --> 00:17:35.176]  You can also make straight donations at mfulworthstore.com, clicking on the big red banner.
[00:17:35.176 --> 00:17:36.558]  A one-time, a recurring.
[00:17:36.558 --> 00:17:38.420]  But I'm asking you to take action.
[00:17:38.420 --> 00:17:39.201]  We're non-violent.
[00:17:39.622 --> 00:17:47.552]  But every time you donate money, every time you buy products, every time you keep us on air, you are literally, non-violently, politically, punching the New World Order in the nose.
[00:17:47.552 --> 00:17:49.875]  Punching their lies in the nose.
[00:17:49.875 --> 00:17:51.717]  We are going to defeat the New World Order.
[00:17:51.717 --> 00:17:52.859]  We're going over the top.
[00:17:52.859 --> 00:17:54.361]  But right now is the critical juncture.
[00:17:54.361 --> 00:17:57.384]  So please go to infowarestore.com and donate now!
[00:18:00.313 --> 00:18:12.799]  In the year 2000, Alex Jones' film Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove showed the world how our so-called elite leaders practice mock ritual sacrifices in private.
[00:18:16.041 --> 00:18:25.869]  In 2007, Alex Jones releases Endgame, exposing the world elite's plans for covertly using biological weapons against all of mankind.
[00:18:25.869 --> 00:18:37.699]  And by the time they launched their attack in 2020, Alex Jones' InfoWars and our audience were there to warn the people of the deadly vaccines that we knew were coming.
[00:18:37.699 --> 00:18:39.240]  This is why they attack us.
[00:18:39.720 --> 00:18:42.241]  This is why we need your support.
[00:18:42.241 --> 00:18:44.042]  Because we tell the truth.
[00:18:44.042 --> 00:18:46.243]  Alex Jones was right.
[00:18:46.243 --> 00:18:47.684]  Join the resistance.
[00:18:47.684 --> 00:18:48.984]  Buy products.
[00:18:48.984 --> 00:18:50.785]  Donate to the cause.
[00:18:50.785 --> 00:18:52.146]  Share the links.
[00:18:52.146 --> 00:18:54.547]  Join us in the fight for freedom.
[00:18:54.547 --> 00:19:00.030]  And help us defeat the New World Order.
[00:19:00.030 --> 00:19:03.271]  They want the planet for themselves, my friend.
[00:19:03.271 --> 00:19:07.573]  And we're so stupid we let them tell us we deserve it.
[00:19:07.573 --> 00:19:08.914]  Except, children
[00:19:10.356 --> 00:19:13.177]  Don't deserve it, do they?
[00:19:13.177 --> 00:19:33.087]  And I looked, and behold, a pale horse, and he that sat on the horse was named Death.
[00:19:33.087 --> 00:19:37.029]  Now the translation is, I looked, and behold a pale horse,
[00:19:38.993 --> 00:19:42.836]  And his name that sat on him was death and hell followed with him.
[00:19:42.836 --> 00:19:47.000]  The Book of Revelation.
[00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:48.661]  Very serious times to be alive, folks.
[00:19:48.661 --> 00:19:50.362]  They're not just doing this as a one-off.
[00:19:50.362 --> 00:19:51.964]  This is the beginning of the rest of our lives.
[00:19:51.964 --> 00:19:53.305]  This is our fight.
[00:19:53.305 --> 00:19:54.646]  And I'm proud of humanity.
[00:19:54.646 --> 00:19:56.107]  The globalists even admit it's leaked.
[00:19:56.107 --> 00:20:01.832]  They're very upset that they're losing and that this hasn't gone the way they thought it would.
[00:20:01.832 --> 00:20:07.737]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[00:20:15.899 --> 00:20:20.862]  A clown president for a clown country.
[00:20:20.862 --> 00:20:24.144]  Puppet president installed by the NWO.
[00:20:24.144 --> 00:20:40.994]  Joe Biden, last night, in the stumbling, bumbling, lying diatribe that was the State of the Union crashing and burning under the treads of the globalist onslaught.
[00:20:40.994 --> 00:20:41.655]  No mistake!
[00:20:43.010 --> 00:20:50.213]  If you try anything to raise the cost of preserving jobs, I will veto it!
[00:20:50.213 --> 00:20:53.854]  I said, we're going to need oil for at least another decade.
[00:20:53.854 --> 00:20:58.416]  And that's going to exceed and beyond that.
[00:20:58.416 --> 00:21:00.497]  We're going to need it.
[00:21:00.497 --> 00:21:02.358]  Production.
[00:21:02.358 --> 00:21:11.101]  So a cashier at a burger place can't walk across town and take the same job at another burger place and make a few bucks more.
[00:21:11.101 --> 00:21:12.462]  It just changed.
[00:21:13.155 --> 00:21:15.916]  They just changed it because we exposed it.
[00:21:15.916 --> 00:21:17.456]  That was part of the deal, guys.
[00:21:17.456 --> 00:21:19.056]  Look it up.
[00:21:19.056 --> 00:21:22.297]  But not anymore.
[00:21:22.297 --> 00:21:24.357]  Fast food restaurants have never had non-competes.
[00:21:24.357 --> 00:21:25.398]  It's another total lie.
[00:21:25.398 --> 00:21:27.218]  I mean, there's hundreds of these clips.
[00:21:27.218 --> 00:21:32.359]  We could just start the thing at the start and spend the whole show playing clips and commenting on it.
[00:21:32.359 --> 00:21:33.659]  State of disunion.
[00:21:33.659 --> 00:21:35.460]  Dems celebrate Republicans' years.
[00:21:37.013 --> 00:21:38.714]  72% approve of the speech.
[00:21:38.714 --> 00:21:42.016]  Yeah, and what alternate universe over there at the Drudge Report?
[00:21:42.016 --> 00:21:45.358]  Whatever happened to poor old Drudge Report?
[00:21:45.358 --> 00:21:50.902]  Now, continuing here, let's play clip seven that's quite a whopper.
[00:21:50.902 --> 00:21:58.106]  Two years ago, COVID had shut down our businesses, closed our schools, and robbed us of so much.
[00:21:58.106 --> 00:22:00.487]  Today, COVID no longer controls our lives.
[00:22:00.487 --> 00:22:03.369]  Let's analyze that 11-second clip before I play it.
[00:22:05.086 --> 00:22:24.695]  Two years ago, it was actually three years ago, the hysteria, the Chinese PSYOP, the big tech PSYOP, working with the actual Pentagon and foreign defense ministries, created fear on purpose of a virus that was about as dangerous as the flu to then roll out a shot that is way, way, way, way, way more dangerous on record.
[00:22:24.695 --> 00:22:33.960]  So it was the globalists that robbed us of our freedom and put masks on our kids and pushed poison shots on the public and starved the third world to death in two years of lockdowns.
[00:22:34.943 --> 00:22:36.384]  Under the IMF and World Bank.
[00:22:36.384 --> 00:22:38.445]  But oh, here he is now.
[00:22:38.445 --> 00:22:45.748]  We've now defeated COVID, we're now out of it because the public woke up to the power grab and said no to the shots, and yes to therapeutics.
[00:22:45.748 --> 00:22:46.189]  Here's the clip.
[00:22:46.189 --> 00:22:55.093]  Two years ago, COVID had shut down, our businesses were closed, our schools were robbed of so much.
[00:22:55.093 --> 00:22:58.955]  Today, COVID no longer controls our lives.
[00:22:58.955 --> 00:23:01.857]  He went on to say he'd saved us.
[00:23:01.857 --> 00:23:02.057]  Wow.
[00:23:03.325 --> 00:23:06.048]  And it just goes on, it just goes on from there.
[00:23:06.048 --> 00:23:10.312]  I mean, I don't know how much of this we should really, really play here.
[00:23:10.312 --> 00:23:11.292]  Let's play clip 12.
[00:23:11.292 --> 00:23:15.737]  Let's have the real president, whether you love him or hate him, he really did win re-election.
[00:23:15.737 --> 00:23:17.418]  He really did piss off the New World Order.
[00:23:17.418 --> 00:23:20.201]  Here's Trump's response to the state of the so-called union.
[00:23:23.459 --> 00:23:25.721]  Here's the real State of the Union.
[00:23:25.721 --> 00:23:35.229]  Over the past two years, under Biden, millions and millions of illegal aliens from 160 different countries have stormed across our southern border.
[00:23:35.229 --> 00:23:43.717]  Drug cartels are now raking in billions of dollars from smuggling poison to kill our people and to kill our children.
[00:23:43.717 --> 00:23:47.940]  Savage killers, rapists, and violent criminals are being released from jail.
[00:23:48.701 --> 00:23:53.605]  To continue their crime wave and under Biden the murder rate has reached the highest
[00:23:54.522 --> 00:24:04.249]  In the history of our country, Biden and the Radical Democrats have wasted trillions of dollars and caused the worst inflation in half a century.
[00:24:04.249 --> 00:24:07.170]  Real wages are down 21 months in a row.
[00:24:07.170 --> 00:24:12.254]  Gas prices have soared and are now going up much higher than even before.
[00:24:12.254 --> 00:24:20.679]  And the typical American family is paying $2,200 in increased energy and food costs each year.
[00:24:20.679 --> 00:24:24.362]  Joe Biden's weaponized Justice Department, and I'm a victim of it,
[00:24:25.042 --> 00:24:27.764]  He's persecuting his political opponents.
[00:24:27.764 --> 00:24:31.367]  His administration is waging war on free speech.
[00:24:31.367 --> 00:24:34.929]  They're trying to indoctrinate and mutilate our children.
[00:24:34.929 --> 00:24:38.472]  He's leading us to the brink of World War Three.
[00:24:38.472 --> 00:24:43.255]  And on top of all of that, he's the most corrupt president in American history.
[00:24:43.255 --> 00:24:45.276]  And it's not even close.
[00:24:45.276 --> 00:24:52.782]  But the good news is we are going to reverse every single crisis, calamity and disaster that Joe Biden has created.
[00:24:53.622 --> 00:25:03.730]  I am running for president to end the destruction of our country and to complete the unfinished business of making America great again.
[00:25:03.730 --> 00:25:08.393]  We will make our country better than ever before.
[00:25:08.393 --> 00:25:11.716]  And we will always put America first.
[00:25:11.716 --> 00:25:14.257]  Thank you.
[00:25:14.257 --> 00:25:18.080]  Well, everything Trump said there is true.
[00:25:18.080 --> 00:25:21.042]  But he still leaves the poisonous elephant in the room.
[00:25:22.023 --> 00:25:27.886]  That is the poison shots though he's starting to more and more back away from it that's a that's a good thing.
[00:25:27.886 --> 00:25:38.612]  I want to open the phones up for first-time callers today at least in the first round the first 20 or so that come in then after that it's a free-for-all.
[00:25:38.612 --> 00:25:49.558]  On the State of the Union, on the war in Europe that's expanding, on the race baiting, on the Grammys and the Satan worship, on
[00:25:51.377 --> 00:26:02.462]  This latest transgender news I'm going to be getting to on Deus Ex and the different things that Elon Musk has been saying and so much more.
[00:26:02.462 --> 00:26:07.105]  So it's basically a free-for-all, any topic, any issue you want to bring up.
[00:26:07.105 --> 00:26:12.007]  But I would imagine you'd want to call in and comment on some of this.
[00:26:12.007 --> 00:26:17.370]  In fact, here's a question I'd like to get your response to if you choose to call in on this subject.
[00:26:19.326 --> 00:26:21.347]  How much worse can this get with Biden?
[00:26:21.347 --> 00:26:28.070]  I know they meant to demoralize us and have a puppet they could blame for their agenda, but man, this is going a lot worse than they even thought.
[00:26:28.070 --> 00:26:29.570]  That's why they're trying to offload him.
[00:26:29.570 --> 00:26:31.151]  How do you think Biden ends?
[00:26:31.151 --> 00:26:35.033]  How do they extricate themselves when Kamala Harris is just as bad or worse?
[00:26:35.033 --> 00:26:37.494]  I mean, literally mentally ill, can hardly talk.
[00:26:38.393 --> 00:26:41.735]  I don't think they want McCarthy in there, but he's third in line.
[00:26:41.735 --> 00:26:46.878]  So would they assassinate Biden and blow up Harris at the same time and then put McCarthy in?
[00:26:46.878 --> 00:26:48.719]  You know, my mom is a smart lady.
[00:26:48.719 --> 00:26:52.401]  She thinks they're going to kill Biden as a type of false flag.
[00:26:52.401 --> 00:26:54.042]  How do you think Biden ends?
[00:26:54.042 --> 00:26:57.624]  And what do you think the globalists are going to pull next?
[00:26:57.624 --> 00:27:01.206]  Because everywhere their agenda is falling apart.
[00:27:01.206 --> 00:27:02.627]  I'm going to cover when we come back.
[00:27:04.653 --> 00:27:12.259]  The COVID news that is so incredibly important and the big developments on that front, some good news and some also very, very horrifying news.
[00:27:12.259 --> 00:27:13.680]  But the total free number to join us is 877-789-2539.
[00:27:13.680 --> 00:27:13.880]  877-789-Alex.
[00:27:13.880 --> 00:27:13.940]  877-789-2539.
[00:27:13.940 --> 00:27:15.421]  We can also talk about the balloon.
[00:27:15.421 --> 00:27:20.726]  And so when the left said, oh, balloons flew over several times and Trump did nothing, they're now confirming
[00:27:34.608 --> 00:27:46.957]  That the Joint Chiefs of Staff and his Chief of Staff, formerly in the Pentagon, chose to not tell the President.
[00:27:46.957 --> 00:28:00.448]  So this is a big deal and shows the treason of the Deep State and how they have this giant intelligence operation against us, but they never actually tell us what a real dangerous, dyed-in-the-wool enemies are doing.
[00:28:00.448 --> 00:28:00.468]  877-789.
[00:28:04.171 --> 00:28:04.571]  2539.
[00:28:04.571 --> 00:28:11.399]  And we've got some great footage of MTG saying that Biden's a liar last night, yelling at him.
[00:28:11.399 --> 00:28:17.165]  And then also her with the gavel when she brought the State of the Union into
[00:28:18.590 --> 00:28:33.262]  Session so we're gonna come out of break and play play both those clips, but I really like MTG She's got a lot of moxie and a lot of spunk and You know so far We're seeing a lot of good stuff out of this new Congress
[00:28:34.002 --> 00:28:44.472]  I think that's because McCarthy is leading by such a small margin that that Freedom Caucus, that Patriot Caucus, that American First Caucus, call it what you will, has got him on a very short leash.
[00:28:44.472 --> 00:28:47.454]  But I'd like to see impeachment begin against Biden right now.
[00:28:47.454 --> 00:28:50.998]  And Napoleon would say, don't interrupt an enemy while they're destroying themselves.
[00:28:50.998 --> 00:28:52.699]  Well, he's destroying us at the same time.
[00:28:52.699 --> 00:28:54.261]  We have a responsibility to remove his damn ass.
[00:28:54.261 --> 00:28:56.823]  It's not some clown spectacle to sit there and laugh at.
[00:28:56.823 --> 00:28:58.304]  It's deadly serious, in my view.
[00:28:58.304 --> 00:28:58.765]  What do you think?
[00:28:59.633 --> 00:29:09.644]  The good news is, the real Red Pill Plus, after over two years being sold out, because the key ingredients were unavailable with supply chain breakdowns, is finally back in stock in the last month.

[00:32:12.171 --> 00:32:13.931]  The information war.
[00:32:13.931 --> 00:32:15.892]  There's nothing you can do more important
[00:32:16.212 --> 00:32:16.533]  Thank you.
[00:32:31.536 --> 00:32:33.037]  Thank you for your support.
[00:33:01.966 --> 00:33:18.678]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones!
[00:33:18.678 --> 00:33:23.602]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones!
[00:33:34.577 --> 00:33:38.699]  In the opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being in the affirmative.
[00:33:38.699 --> 00:33:52.144]  The rules are suspended, the bill is passed, and without objection, the motion to reconsider is laid on the table.
[00:33:52.144 --> 00:33:59.307]  Instead of making the wealthy pay their fair share, some Republicans, some Republicans want Medicare and Social Security to sunset.
[00:33:59.307 --> 00:34:00.348]  I'm not saying it's a majority.
[00:34:04.449 --> 00:34:10.173]  Let me give you, anybody who doubts it, contact my office.
[00:34:10.173 --> 00:34:11.874]  I'll give you a copy.
[00:34:11.874 --> 00:34:13.615]  I'll give you a copy of the proposal.
[00:34:13.615 --> 00:34:16.737]  That means Congress doesn't vote.
[00:34:16.737 --> 00:34:20.319]  Well, I'm glad to see you.
[00:34:20.319 --> 00:34:24.081]  I tell you, I enjoy conversion.
[00:34:24.081 --> 00:34:28.384]  You know, it means if Congress doesn't keep the programs the way they are, they'd go away.
[00:34:28.384 --> 00:34:31.286]  Other Republicans say, I'm not saying it's the majority of you.
[00:34:31.286 --> 00:34:33.067]  I don't even think it's even a significant...
[00:34:34.935 --> 00:34:38.178]  But it's being proposed by individuals.
[00:34:38.178 --> 00:34:43.703]  I'm not politely not naming them, but it's being proposed by some of you.
[00:34:43.703 --> 00:34:56.895]  Look, folks, the idea is that we're not going to be moved into being threatened to default on the debt if we don't respond.
[00:35:11.714 --> 00:35:14.494]  Oh, we're in the danger zone, all right.
[00:35:14.494 --> 00:35:15.815]  And both parties are guilty of it.
[00:35:15.815 --> 00:35:19.715]  The Democrats are in the lead in the guilt department.
[00:35:19.715 --> 00:35:29.817]  They're the ones that are just rampaging forward with out-of-control spending that is a debt default because it will make the currency insolvent very soon, if not imminently.
[00:35:29.817 --> 00:35:33.658]  They're going to bring in their new global currency that I'm going to get to later that I'm preparing.
[00:35:34.431 --> 00:35:35.973]  We've already got loaded phone lines.
[00:35:35.973 --> 00:35:38.715]  I want to just start taking your phone calls.
[00:35:38.715 --> 00:35:44.881]  But as I mentioned, let me hit just today, this is a small spattering of it, of the COVID news.
[00:35:44.881 --> 00:35:46.783]  This is very good news.
[00:35:46.783 --> 00:35:48.085]  This is going to save a lot of lives.
[00:35:48.085 --> 00:35:54.931]  These children deserve to be able to grow up and make their own decisions whether they want to soft kill and euthanize themselves.
[00:35:54.931 --> 00:35:55.272]  Victory!
[00:35:56.533 --> 00:36:06.841]  California quietly drops COVID-19 vaccine mandate for school children, but the schools are still going to try to claim it's a mandate and bully the children.
[00:36:06.841 --> 00:36:08.382]  So a mandate's not a law.
[00:36:08.382 --> 00:36:09.503]  It's a bluff.
[00:36:09.503 --> 00:36:10.184]  It's a fraud.
[00:36:10.184 --> 00:36:17.530]  And then removing the mandate that itself's a bluff, but still acting like there's a mandate, that's a bluff of a bluff of a bluff.
[00:36:18.697 --> 00:36:25.399]  California state leaders appear to have quietly abandoned plans to impose COVID-19 vaccine mandates for school children.
[00:36:25.399 --> 00:36:36.983]  California's Department of Public Health confirmed Friday that K-12 school students will no longer be required to take the experimental COVID jab to attend the classes.
[00:36:36.983 --> 00:36:39.324]  But how many of the little darlings already got poisoned?
[00:36:40.353 --> 00:36:41.275]  This is now confirmed.
[00:36:41.275 --> 00:36:42.879]  This is in the Thailand news.
[00:36:42.879 --> 00:36:44.342]  The princess took her third shot.
[00:36:44.342 --> 00:36:45.906]  A day later, collapsed.
[00:36:45.906 --> 00:36:47.670]  The blood clots in her brain and a coma.
[00:36:47.670 --> 00:36:48.472]  Probably will die.
[00:36:49.810 --> 00:36:53.031]  Now they're saying the government is going to ban the Pfizer jab.
[00:36:53.031 --> 00:36:55.973]  Well, the Moderna is the same thing, just four times stronger.
[00:36:55.973 --> 00:37:00.275]  After Thai Princess falls into coma following booster jab.
[00:37:00.275 --> 00:37:03.316]  I wonder if a prince can come and kiss her and take her out of the deep sleep.
[00:37:03.316 --> 00:37:05.937]  I don't mean that as a joke, it's so sad.
[00:37:05.937 --> 00:37:12.160]  The most vaccine-hesitant group of all PhDs, and above that group, it's medical doctors.
[00:37:15.256 --> 00:37:17.477]  So, there you go.
[00:37:17.477 --> 00:37:22.420]  That's the herald.com, big article, big study.
[00:37:22.420 --> 00:37:26.942]  The most hesitant group is PhDs.
[00:37:26.942 --> 00:37:28.703]  Hmm.
[00:37:28.703 --> 00:37:30.764]  Isn't that interesting?
[00:37:30.764 --> 00:37:42.730]  But the educated idiots, and I'm not putting you down if you have a master's, but you know what I mean, that have just been given the first couple years of indoctrination, the first four years, they, with the bachelor's and the master's, are
[00:37:44.366 --> 00:37:47.828]  The groups that are taking it the most.
[00:37:47.828 --> 00:37:50.190]  Extremely revealing.
[00:37:50.190 --> 00:37:54.873]  Hey, folks with high school are almost as smart as the Ph.D.
[00:37:54.873 --> 00:37:58.115]  people are wise and are the second largest group saying no.
[00:37:58.115 --> 00:38:01.158]  Some college say no.
[00:38:01.158 --> 00:38:07.362]  Twenty percent are hesitant on high school.
[00:38:08.809 --> 00:38:10.970]  Some college, 18%.
[00:38:10.970 --> 00:38:12.931]  Bachelors, 11%.
[00:38:12.931 --> 00:38:15.353]  Masters, 8%.
[00:38:15.353 --> 00:38:17.374]  Professionals, 12%.
[00:38:17.374 --> 00:38:19.335]  And PhDs, 23.9%.
[00:38:19.335 --> 00:38:26.239]  And you know they took that out of a test group that's more leftist.
[00:38:26.239 --> 00:38:31.442]  Because the real numbers are over 80% of Americans don't trust the shot now in major polls.
[00:38:31.442 --> 00:38:33.743]  That is a big deal.
[00:38:33.743 --> 00:38:34.804]  Here's another big report.
[00:38:35.819 --> 00:38:36.500]  Bombshell!
[00:38:36.500 --> 00:38:40.824]  Microcarditis, that's heart swelling, after mRNA vaccines.
[00:38:40.824 --> 00:38:54.157]  And it reports here in a new major study, read it for yourself, that the majority, 9 out of 10 people, that are having microcarditis, it's exploded around the world where the shots are given.
[00:38:54.157 --> 00:38:55.759]  It's been directly linked to the injection.
[00:38:58.578 --> 00:38:59.919]  But the system's countering that.
[00:38:59.919 --> 00:39:01.080]  Associated Press and U.S.
[00:39:01.080 --> 00:39:04.622]  Military Intelligence, and I told you AP is CIA all the way.
[00:39:04.622 --> 00:39:07.683]  So it should be CIA, not Associated Press.
[00:39:07.683 --> 00:39:08.044]  And U.S.
[00:39:08.044 --> 00:39:13.107]  Military Intelligence joined forces to discredit viral hashtag died suddenly trend.
[00:39:13.107 --> 00:39:21.552]  Even though it's insurance companies and government leaders and top statisticians at MIT and Harvard and Yale saying the same thing.
[00:39:23.530 --> 00:39:31.435]  Oh, don't worry, the Pentagon is going to work with the controlled media to brainwash people.
[00:39:31.435 --> 00:39:50.066]  Meanwhile, there's a Veritas News report out, and they just simply pulled up old articles when Obama was in office, where they hailed Obama for building bioweapon labs in Ukraine, nine years ago.
[00:39:51.442 --> 00:39:53.763]  But the media tells you it's a fact check.
[00:39:53.763 --> 00:39:54.543]  Nothing exists.
[00:39:54.543 --> 00:39:55.444]  I said nine years ago.
[00:39:55.444 --> 00:39:57.745]  It's longer than that.
[00:39:57.745 --> 00:40:00.506]  President Obama once visited Ukraine to unveil U.S.
[00:40:00.506 --> 00:40:03.487]  funding for anti-plague labs in 2005.
[00:40:03.487 --> 00:40:09.470]  The funding was used for security upgrades for the Soviet-era bio-facilities, once used for secret bio-weapons programs.
[00:40:09.470 --> 00:40:15.853]  We now know Hunter Biden was involved in, with Joe Biden, weaponizing viruses.
[00:40:15.853 --> 00:40:17.213]  But it's bipartisan evil.
[00:40:17.213 --> 00:40:18.534]  Here's Mike Pompeo.
[00:40:18.534 --> 00:40:19.254]  We'll cue this up.
[00:40:21.331 --> 00:40:23.572]  Here's Pompeo bragging about special classes and how to lie.
[00:40:37.216 --> 00:40:39.277]  What's the cadet motto at West Point?
[00:40:39.277 --> 00:40:43.239]  You will not lie, cheat, or steal, or tolerate those who do.
[00:40:43.239 --> 00:40:44.240]  I was the CIA director.
[00:40:44.240 --> 00:40:47.361]  We lied, we cheated, we sneak, we stole.
[00:40:47.361 --> 00:40:54.885]  We had entire training courses.
[00:40:54.885 --> 00:41:00.888]  But of course, you don't even need people to lie when they're just willing participants and just believe whatever they're told and have Stockholm Syndrome.
[00:41:00.888 --> 00:41:05.451]  That's why statistically, and they'll teach you this in advertising class,
[00:41:06.840 --> 00:41:09.302]  Women are more trusting.
[00:41:09.302 --> 00:41:13.866]  Now, some of the smartest and wisest and canny people I know are women.
[00:41:13.866 --> 00:41:22.633]  I'm not saying women aren't some of the shrewdest people out there, but I'm saying on average, any woman will tell you that shrewd women are very, very gullible compared to men.
[00:41:22.633 --> 00:41:30.039]  And men are incredibly gullible too, but I'm just saying, the whole system's targeting women because women want to work with the system and they don't want to believe they're being hurt.
[00:41:30.039 --> 00:41:32.741]  They don't believe they're in a scam or an abusive relationship with the government.
[00:41:34.319 --> 00:41:55.103]  So they have as their spokespersons women in lab coats, women in medical coats, women in pharmacy outfits saying, oh, it's totally safe for women to take this experimental untested shot that we now have the New England Medical Journal a year ago saying, oh my god, 84% increase in miscarriages in the first two trimesters, something like an 18% in the third.
[00:41:55.103 --> 00:41:56.743]  I mean, it's been devastating.
[00:41:56.743 --> 00:42:03.164]  And the actuaries show from the insurance companies, the medical reports, record stillbirths and miscarriages
[00:42:03.584 --> 00:42:06.645]  And they're giving you an experimental shot directly linked to it.
[00:42:06.645 --> 00:42:10.527]  But oh, they're still out there at Walgreens.
[00:42:10.527 --> 00:42:12.568]  She was told to do this by the PR department.
[00:42:12.568 --> 00:42:13.409]  She doesn't know.
[00:42:13.409 --> 00:42:14.509]  She hasn't researched.
[00:42:14.509 --> 00:42:16.390]  All the other drugs she's got are approved.
[00:42:16.390 --> 00:42:17.871]  Did have research background.
[00:42:17.871 --> 00:42:18.891]  Sometimes they fudge it.
[00:42:18.891 --> 00:42:20.092]  Sometimes it's a lie.
[00:42:20.092 --> 00:42:21.753]  Like Vioxx.
[00:42:21.753 --> 00:42:22.993]  Or Oxycontin.
[00:42:22.993 --> 00:42:24.014]  But still, she knows.
[00:42:24.014 --> 00:42:25.074]  Well, I went to school.
[00:42:25.074 --> 00:42:26.295]  Of course it's approved.
[00:42:26.295 --> 00:42:26.855]  It's safe.
[00:42:26.855 --> 00:42:27.315]  It's good.
[00:42:27.315 --> 00:42:28.116]  No, it wasn't.
[00:42:28.116 --> 00:42:28.596]  Here she is.
[00:42:30.242 --> 00:42:36.806]  If you're pregnant like me and worried about getting your COVID-19 booster, I totally get it, but here's what you should know.
[00:42:36.806 --> 00:42:41.729]  The booster is not a live vaccine, so it can't give you or your baby COVID.
[00:42:41.729 --> 00:42:47.532]  If you're pregnant and you do get COVID, you're more likely to have a severe case compared to someone who's not pregnant.
[00:42:47.532 --> 00:42:50.194]  The booster can help lower this risk.
[00:42:50.194 --> 00:42:55.317]  When you get your booster, your body makes antibodies, and that helps protect you and your baby.
[00:42:55.317 --> 00:42:56.938]  Ready to schedule your appointment?

[00:43:59.886 --> 00:44:07.051]  Mark Twain, one of America's greatest writers and satirists and minds, famously said more than 150 years ago,
[00:44:08.952 --> 00:44:12.495]  Rumors of his demise have been greatly exaggerated.
[00:44:12.495 --> 00:44:16.538]  Because the newspapers kept saying he died decades before he did die.
[00:44:16.538 --> 00:44:18.820]  And it's the same psyop today.
[00:44:18.820 --> 00:44:23.143]  InfoWars is more influential and more powerful than ever because of your support.
[00:44:23.143 --> 00:44:25.685]  And because the facts of what we've covered is coming true.
[00:44:26.385 --> 00:44:35.216]  But if they can convince you we've been shut down, if they can convince you that we're going away, and you stop supporting, you stop spreading the word, then they do win.
[00:44:35.216 --> 00:44:40.902]  Ladies and gentlemen, there's only one group of people that can shut down InfoWars, and that's you, the viewers and listeners.
[00:44:41.403 --> 00:44:43.344]  If you decide we're done, we're done.
[00:44:43.344 --> 00:44:50.609]  If you decide to go to Infowarsstore.com and get supplements and books and films and t-shirts and so much more, we will stay on the air indefinitely.
[00:44:50.609 --> 00:44:52.010]  It is all in your hands.
[00:44:52.010 --> 00:44:53.351]  So thanks for your support.
[00:44:53.351 --> 00:44:54.552]  Stand up against the globalists.
[00:44:54.552 --> 00:44:57.834]  Go to Infowarsstore.com right now and keep us on air.
[00:44:57.834 --> 00:44:58.315]  It's up to you.
[00:45:01.212 --> 00:45:06.095]  I have been in a 28-year marathon battle with the globalists.
[00:45:06.095 --> 00:45:12.498]  I have come from nowhere, to the very heights of politics, not just in America, but in the world.
[00:45:12.498 --> 00:45:17.641]  We are engaging the globalists at point-blank range in the information war.
[00:45:17.641 --> 00:45:19.342]  But I don't deserve the credit.
[00:45:19.342 --> 00:45:20.423]  Yes, I've persevered.
[00:45:20.423 --> 00:45:25.786]  But the listeners and viewers who support Infowars are the real reason we've had the success.
[00:45:26.486 --> 00:45:31.908]  We're having now the greatest victories in the fight against the New World Order we've ever had.
[00:45:31.908 --> 00:45:36.230]  We are now entering the final mile of the marathon.
[00:45:36.230 --> 00:45:45.474]  And that's why, today, it's more important than ever to realize how important you've been in this fight and to continue in the efforts you've been carrying out and to intensify them.
[00:45:45.474 --> 00:45:46.835]  God bless you all.
[00:45:46.835 --> 00:45:47.855]  I salute you.
[00:45:47.855 --> 00:45:48.615]  I thank you.
[00:45:48.615 --> 00:45:54.318]  And I beg you to intensify what you're doing now because we are over the target and history is happening.
[00:45:54.979 --> 00:45:56.306]  The fight is my fight.
[00:45:56.306 --> 00:45:56.950]  It's your fight.
[00:45:56.950 --> 00:45:57.694]  It's our fight.
[00:45:57.694 --> 00:45:58.478]  God bless you all.
[00:45:59.750 --> 00:46:02.972]  InfoWars MD is finally here.
[00:46:02.972 --> 00:46:19.284]  It's the very same high quality products you've been getting through InfoWars Life, but an expanded catalog and in some cases the prices are lower because we're going directly to the source that was supplying the supplement companies that we were buying our high quality products from.
[00:46:19.284 --> 00:46:25.569]  So we're able to lower prices and bring you more products via the InfoWars MD line.
[00:46:26.129 --> 00:46:28.671]  The highest quality, triple tested.
[00:46:28.671 --> 00:46:32.633]  Many of these products are sold on store shelves for more than twice the cost.

[00:47:01.671 --> 00:47:11.734]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones!
[00:47:11.734 --> 00:47:13.034]  The Grid!
[00:47:13.034 --> 00:47:15.815]  It's being built all around us!
[00:47:21.514 --> 00:47:26.177]  We have millions of humans that are here aware of it and begin to stand up against it.
[00:47:26.177 --> 00:47:28.078]  We can build our own system.
[00:47:28.078 --> 00:47:30.999]  The grid.
[00:47:30.999 --> 00:47:34.541]  A digital frontier.
[00:47:34.541 --> 00:47:39.123]  I tried to picture clusters of information as they move through the computer.
[00:47:39.123 --> 00:47:40.864]  What do they look like?
[00:47:40.864 --> 00:47:41.865]  Listen to me carefully.
[00:47:44.304 --> 00:47:48.948]  I'm up here very calm because the hour is very late.
[00:47:48.948 --> 00:47:53.172]  You don't need me to tell you how much danger we're all in right now.
[00:47:53.172 --> 00:47:56.294]  I'm getting chills from the bottom of my feet.
[00:47:56.294 --> 00:48:02.159]  The very tip top of my head.
[00:48:02.159 --> 00:48:07.644]  We're gonna look back on these days as Halcyon.
[00:48:07.644 --> 00:48:09.305]  Better get right with God.
[00:48:09.305 --> 00:48:11.367]  The danger is very great.
[00:48:14.949 --> 00:48:16.471]  I can intellectually see it.
[00:48:16.471 --> 00:48:18.153]  I can politically research it.
[00:48:18.153 --> 00:48:20.576]  I can mathematically equate it.
[00:48:20.576 --> 00:48:22.799]  The gut.
[00:48:22.799 --> 00:48:26.323]  The gut is the connection to God.
[00:48:26.323 --> 00:48:29.627]  The mind, the soul, and beyond.
[00:48:29.627 --> 00:48:31.169]  And they're getting ready.
[00:48:32.591 --> 00:48:41.875]  To create a crisis, whether it's a giant terror attack or a cyber attack that cuts the power to jump the rails fully onto their system.
[00:48:41.875 --> 00:48:45.157]  The COVID release was just the training wheels for this takeover.
[00:48:45.157 --> 00:48:52.460]  Now, people are waking up, people are speaking out, people are saying no, but not fast enough and not strong enough.
[00:48:52.460 --> 00:48:58.142]  Because it sounds so crazy to get up here and lay out all these horrible things that are unfolding.
[00:48:58.142 --> 00:48:59.703]  But if you don't face the horror,
[00:49:00.796 --> 00:49:06.297]  And if you don't realize that submission is death, resistance is victory, then we don't have any hope.
[00:49:06.297 --> 00:49:12.039]  But if you simply wake up to the nightmare and admit we're all in trouble, then we can dig out of this together very easily.
[00:49:12.039 --> 00:49:15.219]  We have a lot of power and we have God on our side.
[00:49:15.219 --> 00:49:16.700]  Now, I'm not going to do a whole show on this.
[00:49:16.700 --> 00:49:18.960]  I've probably done 30, 40 reports.
[00:49:18.960 --> 00:49:21.701]  I've had probably 100 guests on about it.
[00:49:21.701 --> 00:49:27.302]  But if you go back to the emails that came out from whistleblowers and EcoHealth Alliance two and a half, almost three years ago,
[00:49:28.339 --> 00:49:37.042]  They said, hey, listen, we were working on a COVID-19 vaccine for a chimeric virus years before this happened, the exact virus.
[00:49:37.042 --> 00:49:43.164]  And then there were clips of Peter Daszak admitting it and all of this in 2019 before they did it.
[00:49:43.164 --> 00:49:44.204]  You say, why do they do that?
[00:49:44.204 --> 00:49:51.967]  Well, later, if it comes out, they say, well, of course I told you we did.
[00:49:51.967 --> 00:49:54.748]  But there's a new clip of the CEO of Moderna.
[00:49:55.888 --> 00:50:06.854]  They put out the same thing as Pfizer, just the equivalent of four shots in one, and he said he knew there was going to be a pandemic, and they had the vaccine ready in 2019.
[00:50:06.854 --> 00:50:11.657]  Now, we already know that from the documents, two and a half years ago.
[00:50:11.657 --> 00:50:12.278]  We broke that.
[00:50:12.278 --> 00:50:14.979]  We harped on it.
[00:50:14.979 --> 00:50:19.382]  But the issue is, why are they now going around giving speeches and interviews admitting it?
[00:50:19.382 --> 00:50:20.782]  Because they know it's coming out now.
[00:50:20.782 --> 00:50:23.324]  They know the public's finally ready to face that information.
[00:50:25.848 --> 00:50:42.992]  They created the virus, they released it, they created the poison shots, they had them ready, they'd already tested them on animals, they knew it caused heart attacks, it might have occurred, it has blood clots, it's in the 2000 document from the CDC in October predicting everything that happened.
[00:50:42.992 --> 00:50:49.493]  And you say, well why would they admit something like that?
[00:50:49.493 --> 00:50:52.754]  Well there's a lot of good people in the government that are whistleblowers that put those reports out.
[00:50:54.735 --> 00:51:05.109]  But also because the system allows that because it knows it's going to come out later and they want to act like they were investigating and just weren't sure.
[00:51:05.109 --> 00:51:08.053]  So this is sick, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:51:08.053 --> 00:51:10.096]  Here is the Moderna CEO.
[00:51:11.049 --> 00:51:16.091]  A little bit into the new variants and sub-variants and I'm going to go with Stephen Bansal.
[00:51:16.091 --> 00:51:25.135]  Let's talk about vaccine development because we've heard how it happened obviously with COVID-19 starting from 2022 and how extraordinary the process was also in terms of the speed.
[00:51:25.135 --> 00:51:38.901]  How is development, adoption and scaling of vaccine going on when it comes to different variants and sub-variants because this is one of the big concerns as we're all here now and we're discussing, we understand the context and this is a great deal.
[00:51:39.682 --> 00:51:43.486]  Sure, good morning and thank you for having me on the panel.
[00:51:43.486 --> 00:51:49.472]  So the great news versus 2020, where we are today, is we have manufacturing capacity.
[00:51:49.472 --> 00:51:58.921]  As Seth knows, when the pandemic happened, Moderna had made $100,000 in 2019 for the whole year.
[00:51:58.921 --> 00:52:04.046]  And I remember walking after Davos into the office of my head of manufacturing and I say, how we make a billion dollars next year?
[00:52:05.006 --> 00:52:07.167]  And they look at me a bit funny and say, what?
[00:52:07.167 --> 00:52:08.707]  I say, yeah, we need to make a billion of those next year.
[00:52:08.707 --> 00:52:12.088]  It's going to be a pandemic.
[00:52:12.088 --> 00:52:17.630]  So Moderna is this whole globalist consortium created right before COVID-19.
[00:52:17.630 --> 00:52:22.031]  He says, in 2019, we created X number of doses.
[00:52:22.031 --> 00:52:27.472]  He said, how do we make a bunch of money next year?
[00:52:27.472 --> 00:52:32.474]  They're just hiding it in plain view in front of everybody like it's hilarious.
[00:52:33.519 --> 00:52:37.241]  And what came out two weeks ago in the Project Veritas undercover video?
[00:52:37.241 --> 00:52:43.943]  Their head of global mRNA, who never even got his medical degree.
[00:52:43.943 --> 00:52:48.565]  Never finished his residency, never got his degree, in a white lab coat.
[00:52:48.565 --> 00:52:50.246]  People said, oh, this guy can't be real.
[00:52:50.246 --> 00:52:53.087]  Later you find the videos and photos of him as their global head.
[00:52:56.701 --> 00:52:58.564]  Telling you it's totally safe and effective.
[00:52:58.564 --> 00:53:01.207]  And he says to Project Veritas, look, I'm just a salesman.
[00:53:01.207 --> 00:53:03.290]  I just lie to people.
[00:53:03.290 --> 00:53:04.071]  It's no big deal.
[00:53:04.071 --> 00:53:04.952]  I just lie.
[00:53:04.952 --> 00:53:12.923]  Yeah, you're hired like Albert Bourla, the head of the company, who used to deliver dogs and cats at a veterinary clinic.
[00:53:13.851 --> 00:53:19.036]  And you look at the whole list of who they got up there, they're not even virologists or scientists or geneticists.
[00:53:19.036 --> 00:53:27.803]  They're just the front company, as Dr. Peter McCullough said when he was on last week, for the military-industrial complex that already made this and created it in the U.S.
[00:53:27.803 --> 00:53:30.045]  and then acted like it came out of the Wuhan lab.
[00:53:30.045 --> 00:53:31.847]  They just did that as their cover story.
[00:53:32.950 --> 00:53:36.673]  And left it all nebulous, like, oh, it's not out of a lab to hold that over China.
[00:53:36.673 --> 00:53:44.458]  Go along with what we're doing, you know, do what we say, you're in the New World Order, we've released a bioweapon, just work with us, and we won't say you did it.
[00:53:44.458 --> 00:53:48.901]  And China, they once said, it's the Pentagon, it came out of the United States, which it did.
[00:53:48.901 --> 00:53:53.364]  And I'm not defending Xi Jinping, he certainly used it for a power grab.
[00:53:53.364 --> 00:53:54.845]  Now what else is all over the dish?
[00:53:54.845 --> 00:53:56.766]  Every day we see the new studies out.
[00:53:56.766 --> 00:54:00.769]  Cancer's the highest rate it's ever been, not just in old people, or children,
[00:54:02.128 --> 00:54:07.112]  But people in their 30s and 40s.
[00:54:07.112 --> 00:54:09.513]  COVID-19, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:54:09.513 --> 00:54:13.236]  Cancer is striking more people in their late 30s and 40s.
[00:54:13.236 --> 00:54:17.819]  Here's what you need to know.
[00:54:17.819 --> 00:54:19.941]  Cancer is striking more people in their 30s and 40s.
[00:54:19.941 --> 00:54:20.942]  Here's what you need to know.
[00:54:20.942 --> 00:54:24.384]  Oh, it's just totally normal.
[00:54:24.384 --> 00:54:26.686]  Remember two and a half years ago when the shots started in England?
[00:54:26.686 --> 00:54:29.248]  They said, well, it'll look like you have cancer.
[00:54:31.442 --> 00:54:37.826]  When you go to the oncologist or go to the doctor.
[00:54:37.826 --> 00:54:39.648]  But don't worry about it.
[00:54:39.648 --> 00:54:41.289]  Just don't treat it.
[00:54:41.289 --> 00:54:44.051]  Just like, oh, you're coming with this really bad cough and cold and can't breathe?
[00:54:44.051 --> 00:54:44.931]  Don't give you drugs.
[00:54:44.931 --> 00:54:45.912]  Don't give you anything to help you.
[00:54:45.912 --> 00:54:46.853]  Don't give you therapeutics.
[00:54:46.853 --> 00:54:48.013]  Just come back when you're dying.
[00:54:48.013 --> 00:54:51.976]  We'll put a ventilator in you and give you $50,000 plus for the federal government to kill your ass.
[00:54:51.976 --> 00:54:55.799]  And the same bounty program was run all over the Western world with the shots we're giving.
[00:54:55.799 --> 00:54:56.819]  This is 100% premeditated on record.
[00:54:59.361 --> 00:55:11.571]  To test, bringing out a poison, giving it to you, not treating you, killing you, and then sitting back and laughing all the way to the bank and corrupting the entire medical media system in the process.
[00:55:11.571 --> 00:55:14.333]  They want to kill us, they want to depopulate us, this is how they do it.
[00:55:14.333 --> 00:55:16.555]  And they're testing to see what they can get away with.
[00:55:21.977 --> 00:55:28.321]  And remember what Bill Gates famously said, we're taking genetically modified organisms and we're injecting them into little kids' arms.
[00:55:28.321 --> 00:55:30.622]  We're shooting them right in the vein.
[00:55:30.622 --> 00:55:33.964]  And he goes on to say, we have no idea what it'll do.
[00:55:33.964 --> 00:55:42.129]  But Sean Penn says, if someone chooses not to take a COVID vaccine, they should choose to stay home, not go to work, and not have a job.
[00:55:43.933 --> 00:55:45.194]  We're gonna go to break in about two minutes.
[00:55:45.194 --> 00:55:50.056]  Come back in the second and third hour and take your phone calls one after another.
[00:55:50.056 --> 00:55:53.278]  But I got to most of the stack and you see how important it is.
[00:55:53.278 --> 00:56:00.442]  I got a bunch of other news and Deus Ex and Elon Musk and the war in Ukraine.
[00:56:00.442 --> 00:56:01.322]  It's all coming up.
[00:56:01.322 --> 00:56:04.444]  I want to thank you all for your tireless support over the years.
[00:56:04.444 --> 00:56:06.665]  I want to thank you all for your prayers.
[00:56:06.665 --> 00:56:11.628]  I want to thank you all for allowing us to stay on air and I want to just encourage you
[00:56:13.416 --> 00:56:16.859]  Go to InfoWarsTore.com because I've been so busy.
[00:56:16.859 --> 00:56:30.231]  We're supposed to end this sale on Monday, but I've been so busy just working on stories and reports and financing the operation that I've not had time to go look at our inventory and what we even have to be on sale when this sale ends.
[00:56:30.231 --> 00:56:35.855]  So up to 50% off at InfoWarsTore.com on amazing high quality products.
[00:56:36.972 --> 00:56:37.612]  Alex Jones is right.
[00:56:37.612 --> 00:56:39.874]  Emergency sale should end today.
[00:56:39.874 --> 00:56:42.876]  I'm going to try for the show to go figure out what we've got and what the new sale will be.
[00:56:42.876 --> 00:56:46.478]  But this is as big a sale as we have any time during the year.
[00:56:46.478 --> 00:56:48.139]  Last time we had a sale this big was Christmas.
[00:56:48.139 --> 00:56:50.781]  It'll be a while till we have one this wide.
[00:56:50.781 --> 00:56:52.062]  A lot of these things are selling out.
[00:56:52.662 --> 00:56:53.162]  I don't think so.
[00:57:08.251 --> 00:57:10.333]  People take, like, stimulants to get a brain boost.
[00:57:10.333 --> 00:57:11.914]  You want to try krill oil, folks.
[00:57:11.914 --> 00:57:13.675]  Take it anytime during the day.
[00:57:13.675 --> 00:57:16.257]  It's the strongest krill oil there is.
[00:57:16.257 --> 00:57:17.178]  Fish oil's great, too.
[00:57:17.178 --> 00:57:21.181]  We sell high-end, highest-rate fish oil at 40% off, as well.
[00:57:21.181 --> 00:57:22.582]  And it's selling out, ending soon.
[00:57:22.582 --> 00:57:24.204]  But you need to take advantage of that.
[00:57:24.204 --> 00:57:25.545]  MFullWorksTour.com.
[00:57:25.545 --> 00:57:26.866]  Visit Magnesium back in stock.
[00:57:26.866 --> 00:57:30.989]  And the crew tried the new bone broth and said, man, it tastes like Lucky Charms or something.
[00:57:30.989 --> 00:57:31.890]  Yeah, it's amazing.
[00:57:32.230 --> 00:57:43.253]  What really matters is I'd drink it if it tasted horrible, but the effects for your immune system, your bones and joints, ultimate bone broth, but so much more, like the turmeric, the chaga mushroom, the bee pollen, back in stock.
[00:57:43.253 --> 00:57:44.453]  Infowarstore.com.
[00:57:44.453 --> 00:57:45.093]  We'll be right back.
[00:57:45.093 --> 00:57:49.815]  Stay with us.
[00:57:49.815 --> 00:57:52.755]  Well, I just want to tell you about Diet Force.
[00:57:52.755 --> 00:57:54.996]  Diet Force is amazing.
[00:57:54.996 --> 00:57:56.836]  I'm 45 and I have bits.
[00:57:56.836 --> 00:57:59.337]  I go to the gym and I have bits that won't move.
[00:58:00.186 --> 00:58:04.330]  And diet force has helped me move those bits like that.
[00:58:04.330 --> 00:58:09.115]  Under my pecs, my belly, I'm just taking diet force two tablets a day.
[00:58:09.115 --> 00:58:11.338]  Man, if you're like struggling to get
[00:58:12.498 --> 00:58:14.779]  Like, chip shake for the ladies.
[00:58:14.779 --> 00:58:17.499]  Mate, DietForce is the go.
[00:58:17.499 --> 00:58:20.400]  You have to get the DietForce and have to a day.
[00:58:20.400 --> 00:58:22.180]  And just keep at it.
[00:58:22.180 --> 00:58:23.681]  InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:58:23.681 --> 00:58:24.561]  X7 DietForce.
[00:58:24.561 --> 00:58:28.042]  InfoWarsStore.com, baby!
[00:58:28.042 --> 00:58:28.702]  Now on sale.
[00:58:28.702 --> 00:58:29.582]  DietForce.
[00:58:29.582 --> 00:58:30.302]  We're cutting that ad.
[00:58:30.302 --> 00:58:31.563]  We're cutting that call into an ad.
[00:58:31.563 --> 00:58:32.383]  I can guarantee you that.
[00:58:32.383 --> 00:58:34.384]  Thanks so much for the call, Grant.
[00:58:34.384 --> 00:58:35.924]  God bless Australia.
[00:58:35.924 --> 00:58:37.044]  We'll be right back, folks.
[00:58:37.044 --> 00:58:37.664]  Don't go anywhere.
[00:58:37.664 --> 00:58:38.745]  InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:58:38.745 --> 00:58:39.365]  DietForce.
[00:58:39.365 --> 00:58:39.805]  Get it now.
[00:58:49.488 --> 00:58:53.037]  The most banned man in America, Alex Jones!
[00:58:57.762 --> 00:58:59.103]  I want you all to know something.
[00:58:59.103 --> 00:59:01.064]  Alex Jones was right.
[00:59:01.064 --> 00:59:04.606]  Alex is right about far more than is wrong.
[00:59:04.606 --> 00:59:07.728]  Alex has been right on for over a decade.
[00:59:07.728 --> 00:59:11.551]  I don't care how you slice it, dice it, flip it up or rub it down.
[00:59:11.551 --> 00:59:14.192]  Alex Jones was right.
[00:59:14.192 --> 00:59:17.715]  Think about how frustrated we are if you've been awake for a year or two.
[00:59:17.715 --> 00:59:21.157]  Imagine being like an Alex Jones or those guys who've been awake for like decades.
[00:59:21.437 --> 00:59:24.319]  Alex Jones called this years ago.
[00:59:24.319 --> 00:59:25.339]  Years ago.
[00:59:25.339 --> 00:59:27.420]  Alex Jones never bought the Russia hoax.
[00:59:27.420 --> 00:59:29.401]  Not for a second.
[00:59:29.401 --> 00:59:31.922]  You are one of the great thinkers of this.
[00:59:31.922 --> 00:59:34.404]  You are a martyr to the First Amendment.
[00:59:34.404 --> 00:59:37.505]  The government fears Alex Jones.
[00:59:37.505 --> 00:59:39.086]  That's why the globalists hate me.
[00:59:39.086 --> 00:59:44.809]  It's because I'm exposing their corporate worldwide tyranny.
[00:59:44.809 --> 00:59:46.090]  AlexJonesLive.com
[00:59:51.388 --> 00:59:55.991]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[00:59:55.991 --> 01:00:04.017]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:00:04.017 --> 01:00:06.359]  China is testing.
[01:00:06.359 --> 01:00:08.461]  China is manipulating.
[01:00:08.461 --> 01:00:11.823]  China is seeing how far they can go with these probes.
[01:00:11.823 --> 01:00:17.107]  And when you put it together with their Confucian societies and six billion dollars a year in the U.S.
[01:00:17.107 --> 01:00:20.750]  universities to control academia and biopoliticians and you look at
[01:00:21.250 --> 01:00:26.073]  The acquisition of the media and the fact that they own four of the six big production houses in Hollywood.
[01:00:51.490 --> 01:00:55.892]  ...is being foisted by a handful of corporations and the Chinese Communists.
[01:00:55.892 --> 01:00:58.394]  The people that run our country are out to get us.
[01:00:58.394 --> 01:01:01.155]  They're at war with us on every front, and you already know that.
[01:01:01.155 --> 01:01:18.884]  But as soon as we can get the bureaucrats and the woke leftists to just pull back and understand that they've been Stockholm Syndrome'd, and that they're helping their own abusers and destroyers, and they're pretending like they're part of some liberal revolution to create a utopia,
[01:01:19.622 --> 01:01:31.353]  As soon as they realize that this liberal utopia is meant to bring in total autocratic tyranny, and then they're going to have a backlash and ban the entire leftist system that they've injected into us to only paralyze us.
[01:01:31.353 --> 01:01:36.357]  In the next phase of the New World Order program, ladies and gentlemen, it's going to be eugenics all the way.
[01:01:36.357 --> 01:01:43.204]  But they intend on making the world so hellish in the build-up to 2030 that everybody will just wink, wink.
[01:01:44.073 --> 01:01:51.919]  When they release the ray-specific bioweapons, starting with Africa, that are going to wipe that continent absolutely out.
[01:01:51.919 --> 01:02:03.608]  The facts are, China has put a lot of money into high-altitude balloons for what you call satellite arrays, surveillance arrays, but more importantly, communication systems.
[01:02:03.608 --> 01:02:09.333]  But they've also put a lot of money in to deliver an electromagnetic pulse weapon that's
[01:02:10.143 --> 01:02:13.784]  Detonated and powered by an atomic or hydrogen bomb going off.
[01:02:13.784 --> 01:02:26.506]  It's estimated that a 40 megaton bomb, that's a medium-sized bomb, would knock out large portions of the United States that was detonated around 80,000 feet in the right conditions.
[01:02:26.506 --> 01:02:34.708]  But there's more radiation that goes further at night because of radiation that's already in the atmosphere from the sun.
[01:02:34.708 --> 01:02:37.229]  So they would try to detonate these at night.
[01:02:37.229 --> 01:02:38.409]  They would have a much bigger effect.
[01:02:39.355 --> 01:02:41.898]  You've seen what solar flares do, wreaking havoc with satellites.
[01:02:41.898 --> 01:02:43.861]  That's nothing compared to this.
[01:02:43.861 --> 01:02:52.692]  And the fact that Biden didn't order this shot down day one, the fact that the Communist Chinese confirmed it was theirs.
[01:02:53.863 --> 01:02:56.385]  Just shows you what the Border Patrol said.
[01:02:56.385 --> 01:02:58.566]  They're not watching the border, they're not watching anything.
[01:02:58.566 --> 01:02:59.647]  Except us.
[01:02:59.647 --> 01:03:04.030]  Order the Pentagon to shoot it down on Wednesday as soon as possible.
[01:03:04.030 --> 01:03:11.035]  They decided that the best time to do that was as it got over water, outside, within our, within the 12-mile limit.
[01:03:11.035 --> 01:03:18.860]  And then you have Hunter Biden with a laptop and saying he works for Chinese intelligence and all the classified documents at the house he was renting for 50 grand a month from his dad.
[01:03:18.860 --> 01:03:23.303]  These are all just absolutely pieces of proof
[01:03:24.403 --> 01:03:29.028]  That the Bidens are Chinese Communist agents.
[01:03:29.028 --> 01:03:36.555]  $100,000 a month as a retainer for Hunter Biden to work for a Chinese entity with ties to the Chinese Communist Party.
[01:03:36.555 --> 01:03:42.041]  $500,000 right off the top as a one-time payment to Hunter and $65,000 a month for James Biden, the President's
[01:03:47.807 --> 01:03:49.969]  The fact that this has been going on is important.
[01:04:12.515 --> 01:04:26.478]  Yes, the globalists set up China, but by the time Xi Jinping came along, and now he's arrested his predecessor that was working with the globalists, Xi Jinping has told Big Tech and the New World Order, I'm in charge, and I'm not in a deal with you anymore.
[01:04:26.478 --> 01:04:36.401]  And so, just like Stalin and Hitler for the first two years of World War II had a deal, and then Hitler broke it, it's the same story again.
[01:05:00.006 --> 01:05:02.848]  I just want to say about diet force.
[01:05:02.848 --> 01:05:04.689]  Diet force is amazing.
[01:05:04.689 --> 01:05:06.951]  I'm 45 and I have bits.
[01:05:06.951 --> 01:05:10.293]  I go to the gym and I have bits that won't move.
[01:05:10.293 --> 01:05:12.875]  And diet force has helped me move those bits.
[01:05:12.875 --> 01:05:19.239]  Like under my pecs, my belly, I'm just taking diet force two tablets a day.
[01:05:19.239 --> 01:05:21.441]  Man, if you're like struggling to get
[01:05:22.620 --> 01:05:24.902]  Like, chip shake for the ladies.
[01:05:24.902 --> 01:05:27.624]  Mate, DietForce is the go.
[01:05:27.624 --> 01:05:30.527]  You have to get the DietForce and have a good day.
[01:05:30.527 --> 01:05:32.288]  And just keep at it.
[01:05:32.288 --> 01:05:33.790]  InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:05:33.790 --> 01:05:35.191]  X7 DietForce.

[01:05:38.173 --> 01:05:38.814]  Now on sale.
[01:05:38.814 --> 01:05:39.695]  DietForce.
[01:05:39.695 --> 01:05:40.435]  We're cutting that ad.

[01:05:44.519 --> 01:05:46.040]  God bless Australia.
[01:05:46.040 --> 01:05:47.181]  We'll be right back, folks.
[01:05:47.181 --> 01:05:47.782]  Don't go anywhere.
[01:05:47.782 --> 01:05:48.863]  InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:05:48.863 --> 01:05:49.503]  DietForce.
[01:05:49.503 --> 01:05:49.944]  Get it now.
[01:06:10.909 --> 01:06:16.011]  You are listening to an Infowars.com frontline report.
[01:06:16.011 --> 01:06:21.434]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:06:21.434 --> 01:06:23.055]  So we're deep into the New World Order.
[01:06:23.055 --> 01:06:25.776]  Their plan to depopulate is not going as well as they thought.
[01:06:25.776 --> 01:06:28.057]  They're being exposed every front, but they're not going to give up.
[01:06:28.057 --> 01:06:29.238]  What do you think is coming next?
[01:06:30.171 --> 01:06:48.946]  Now, later in the hour, I'm going to hit this Elon Musk, Deus Ex article that's on Infowars.com and his comments about it, about, oh, this is the ultimate, this video game predicted it all, this is so incredible, it's all real, the FEMA camps, the forced shots, the government creating viruses, the New World Order.
[01:06:48.946 --> 01:06:50.387]  I inspired that game.
[01:06:50.387 --> 01:06:52.809]  I talked to the developers of it that made it in Austin.
[01:06:52.809 --> 01:06:55.511]  They talked to me about putting out another version and being part of it.
[01:06:55.511 --> 01:06:56.552]  I never got back with them.
[01:06:56.552 --> 01:06:58.213]  It never happened.
[01:06:58.213 --> 01:06:59.094]  It's not about bragging.
[01:07:00.342 --> 01:07:04.689]  It's just saying, here he is praising this video game and he says do everything and...
[01:07:05.962 --> 01:07:11.705]  I made films that wasn't a speculative video game predicting all this from the Globalist's own documents.
[01:07:11.705 --> 01:07:13.985]  And here's Elon Musk with Deus Ex.
[01:07:13.985 --> 01:07:17.027]  So we've taken a few clips from the game and more from over the years.
[01:07:17.027 --> 01:07:23.670]  If you don't believe me, just search engine, you know, Alex Jones was the main impetus for Deus Ex.
[01:07:23.670 --> 01:07:25.731]  How do you say it?
[01:07:25.731 --> 01:07:28.612]  It's not Deus Ex, it's Deus Ex.
[01:07:28.612 --> 01:07:31.993]  And it just goes on from there, kind of like I was airing the 2016 new
[01:07:34.034 --> 01:07:34.794]  X-Files Show.
[01:07:34.794 --> 01:07:43.819]  And I was like, yeah, Chris Carter says it's main character is based on me and the New World Order and the plan to release a virus to control the population and bring in world government.
[01:07:43.819 --> 01:07:50.362]  And then people go and look up Variety and Hollywood Reporter and go, wow, Chris Carter really said that.
[01:07:50.362 --> 01:07:52.303]  It's not about me getting credit.
[01:07:52.303 --> 01:07:58.606]  It's about credit for all of you that supported the broadcast, all of our guests, everything we did that we were dead on.
[01:07:58.606 --> 01:08:02.608]  And now Elon Musk is giving it credit for everything, but not giving me credit.
[01:08:02.608 --> 01:08:02.948]  And look,
[01:08:03.408 --> 01:08:16.960]  I like overall what he's doing with free speech and the rest of it, saying our population's going down, we need more children, we need to go to space, the shots made me sick, don't take the shots.
[01:08:16.960 --> 01:08:19.382]  And I'm not even begging to go back on Twitter.
[01:08:19.382 --> 01:08:21.464]  It's kind of cool to still be the most banned guy.
[01:08:21.464 --> 01:08:23.826]  It's just that what is he so afraid of?
[01:08:23.826 --> 01:08:29.791]  Because he's becoming Alex Jones, even mainstream media says that, but then I'm still the bad guy?
[01:08:31.963 --> 01:08:36.826]  Elon Musk is not stupid, and he knows the misrepresentations about me are not accurate.
[01:08:36.826 --> 01:08:40.709]  And so I'm just simply asking Musk what he thinks is really going on.
[01:08:40.709 --> 01:08:43.311]  We've got so much more to hit as well, but let's go to your phone calls.
[01:08:43.311 --> 01:08:44.892]  They're all over the map, which is great.
[01:08:44.892 --> 01:08:47.974]  Takes us to so many amazing directions.
[01:08:47.974 --> 01:08:50.536]  Let's go ahead and talk to Brian in Colorado.
[01:08:50.536 --> 01:08:51.436]  You're on the air, Brian.
[01:08:51.436 --> 01:08:52.797]  Welcome.
[01:08:52.797 --> 01:08:54.098]  Hey, Alex.
[01:08:54.098 --> 01:08:57.381]  I just definitely want to say some things about your supplements.
[01:08:57.381 --> 01:08:59.262]  I've worked at Natural Grocers for years.
[01:09:00.465 --> 01:09:09.551]  I've looked at your guys' ingredients and they are really good formulas that are definitely going to help people's natural abilities to support their own health.
[01:09:09.551 --> 01:09:15.896]  Put your money where your mouth is and give Alex that money because he deserves it.
[01:09:15.896 --> 01:09:17.156]  I'm not a rocket scientist.
[01:09:17.156 --> 01:09:22.520]  I go out and find out who already has the best selling products of the highest rated and then I say, can you make it stronger?
[01:09:22.520 --> 01:09:23.861]  I want to private label it.
[01:09:23.861 --> 01:09:26.523]  And then I know I'm selling the very best thing there is.
[01:09:26.523 --> 01:09:27.804]  I've done some other stuff like
[01:09:28.632 --> 01:09:29.152]  Well, it's deception.
[01:09:29.152 --> 01:09:29.513]  I mean, it's easy.
[01:09:29.513 --> 01:09:30.434]  You said that they've made masks.
[01:09:54.713 --> 01:09:56.314]  Where they fooled the president with him.
[01:09:56.314 --> 01:09:58.296]  You know, they were in the same room with him.
[01:09:58.296 --> 01:09:59.276]  They took the mask off.
[01:09:59.276 --> 01:10:00.637]  He didn't even know the mask was there.
[01:10:00.637 --> 01:10:03.739]  So I know that there's a way of killing him.
[01:10:03.739 --> 01:10:05.240]  I know that they need him out of the way.
[01:10:05.240 --> 01:10:11.665]  It's just with Kamala Harris being the second as a VP and then us now having the House.
[01:10:11.665 --> 01:10:13.606]  I'm confused about how they want to do it.
[01:10:13.606 --> 01:10:18.309]  I felt like they had a lot better opportunity with Polis, you know.
[01:10:18.309 --> 01:10:23.333]  Or no, not Polis, but the, you know, the Wicked Witch, the last speaker of the House.
[01:10:24.491 --> 01:10:25.592]  Pelosi.
[01:10:25.592 --> 01:10:26.794]  Yeah, of course.
[01:10:26.794 --> 01:10:28.935]  You know, I thought they had a better opportunity with her.
[01:10:28.935 --> 01:10:33.199]  So, I mean, having a house is a big strategic thing that I know Trump wanted.
[01:10:33.199 --> 01:10:35.361]  So, I know that a deception is coming.
[01:10:35.361 --> 01:10:38.224]  I know that Biden is not the same person that he was.
[01:10:38.224 --> 01:10:41.507]  I mean, you can look at him and see the difference.
[01:10:41.507 --> 01:10:44.469]  And then I'd say that's the biggest next thing for everyone to look at.
[01:10:44.469 --> 01:10:48.112]  Look at what your wallets were like during the Trump administration.
[01:10:48.112 --> 01:10:49.574]  Look at the bank accounts you had.
[01:10:49.574 --> 01:10:50.915]  Look at what you paid for on eggs.
[01:10:51.993 --> 01:10:57.198]  And then look at all these little tiny things around you that can show you these deceptions.
[01:10:57.198 --> 01:11:02.243]  You can Google something like snowboarding, and you'll find thousands of articles, thousands of pages.
[01:11:02.243 --> 01:11:06.768]  But when you Google Alex Jones, they've deleted half the Internet.
[01:11:06.768 --> 01:11:07.669]  Just look.
[01:11:07.669 --> 01:11:15.156]  Look at your own personal things around you, because when you start realizing all this, your cognitive dissonance kicks in, and it's hard to go through.
[01:11:15.899 --> 01:11:17.020]  But it's all real.
[01:11:17.020 --> 01:11:17.900]  Absolutely.
[01:11:17.900 --> 01:11:19.021]  It's incredible.
[01:11:19.021 --> 01:11:23.603]  If you type in microcarditis COVID vaccine, it's all fake results.
[01:11:23.603 --> 01:11:30.487]  But in the documents, in the government documents, and the governments are admitting it's killing people, but you can't even find the results.
[01:11:30.487 --> 01:11:35.310]  That's why, I mean, I don't even like Microsoft and Bill Gates, but Bing is better.
[01:11:35.310 --> 01:11:37.511]  DuckDuckGo is great.
[01:11:37.511 --> 01:11:39.472]  It's just crazy.
[01:11:39.472 --> 01:11:40.673]  All right, let's go and take another call.
[01:11:40.673 --> 01:11:41.553]  Thank you, sir.
[01:11:41.553 --> 01:11:43.054]  Let's talk to Aaron in Oregon.
[01:11:43.054 --> 01:11:43.555]  You're on the air.
[01:11:43.555 --> 01:11:44.055]  Thanks for holding.
[01:11:45.526 --> 01:11:46.306]  Yeah, hey Alex.
[01:11:46.306 --> 01:11:54.868]  Hey, um, you know, after watching that mumbling pudding brain Biden last night, I mean, he didn't even know that Schumer was the majority leader.
[01:11:54.868 --> 01:11:56.748]  He called him a minority leader.
[01:11:56.748 --> 01:12:11.631]  And, you know, I just, I voted for Trump twice and I think it was the greatest president, but I just don't feel how there's any way they're going to ever going to let him or anybody like that ever take over again after the last couple of elections.
[01:12:11.631 --> 01:12:14.291]  And I just don't see how this is ever going to end.
[01:12:15.231 --> 01:12:17.453]  Anything positive, you know?
[01:12:17.453 --> 01:12:18.293]  Well, you're absolutely right.
[01:12:18.293 --> 01:12:26.599]  I mean, it's clear the globalists are running America and Europe into the ground, shutting us down economically, culturally, spiritually.
[01:12:26.599 --> 01:12:27.660]  Why are they doing it?
[01:12:27.660 --> 01:12:33.545]  Because they don't want the rest of the world to aspire to the heights that Western civilization took humanity.
[01:12:33.545 --> 01:12:39.069]  The globalists are in direct competition with Western civilization.
[01:12:39.069 --> 01:12:43.552]  Yeah, and it just, you know, Biden, he just couldn't even
[01:12:44.343 --> 01:12:45.203]  I agree with you.
[01:12:45.203 --> 01:12:46.044]  Thanks for the call.
[01:12:46.044 --> 01:12:47.744]  Let's talk to Mike in Kansas.
[01:12:47.744 --> 01:12:48.124]  Go ahead.
[01:12:48.124 --> 01:12:48.705]  Thanks for calling.
[01:13:14.793 --> 01:13:18.097]  Hey, I'm coming in about how they get rid of Biden.
[01:13:18.097 --> 01:13:19.098]  Yes, sir.
[01:13:19.098 --> 01:13:22.302]  They use the same same playbook they use with Nixon.
[01:13:22.302 --> 01:13:27.309]  They get rid of old cameltoe Harris, whatever the whatever they come up to get rid of her.
[01:13:27.309 --> 01:13:32.355]  And then he gets to nominate Big Mike or Newsom, who then gets approved by Congress.
[01:13:32.958 --> 01:13:36.200]  None of them have any reason in the world to get rid of Biden, and there you go.
[01:13:55.046 --> 01:14:00.911]  Then basically Congress then agreed who to put in, politically, and they put in Gerald Ford.
[01:14:00.911 --> 01:14:05.115]  So people that say, oh, it'll be Kevin McCarthy in the line of ascension.
[01:14:05.115 --> 01:14:05.636]  No.
[01:14:05.636 --> 01:14:08.618]  They can basically all politically agree on who they want.
[01:14:08.618 --> 01:14:19.168]  Who do you think that person will be if they say blow up an airplane with Biden on it or shoot him and then indict Kamala for corruption?
[01:14:19.168 --> 01:14:20.149]  Who do you think they want in?
[01:14:22.157 --> 01:14:27.818]  Oh, either Big Mike or Newsom, but I think they get rid of Harris before they do any of that other stuff.
[01:14:27.818 --> 01:14:29.498]  No, I think you're really a smart cookie.
[01:14:29.498 --> 01:14:31.599]  I was thinking that a week ago when I saw that.
[01:14:31.599 --> 01:14:36.020]  They're going to get rid of the Vice President first before they go after Biden.
[01:14:36.020 --> 01:14:36.280]  Right.
[01:14:36.280 --> 01:14:38.460]  Then you know what's coming after that.
[01:14:38.460 --> 01:14:41.241]  And then how do they get rid of Biden?
[01:14:41.241 --> 01:14:42.721]  It doesn't matter at that point.
[01:14:42.721 --> 01:14:44.741]  They can claim he's senile.
[01:14:44.741 --> 01:14:46.922]  Anything.
[01:14:46.922 --> 01:14:48.662]  They claim a white supremacist shoots him.
[01:14:49.921 --> 01:14:50.441]  Yeah.
[01:14:50.441 --> 01:14:53.904]  They want to turn him into a victim and use his murder.
[01:14:53.904 --> 01:14:56.206]  They're not just going to kill him or assassinate him.
[01:14:56.206 --> 01:14:57.967]  They'll do it in some way to blame us.
[01:14:57.967 --> 01:15:00.269]  I think that's really what's going to happen.
[01:15:00.269 --> 01:15:02.391]  Most likely.
[01:15:02.391 --> 01:15:03.031]  Anything else, sir?
[01:15:03.031 --> 01:15:06.414]  Yeah, I wore my shirt, my Red Fauci shirt, the other day.
[01:15:06.414 --> 01:15:07.855]  Played pool.
[01:15:07.855 --> 01:15:09.696]  People said, hey, Alex was right.
[01:15:09.696 --> 01:15:12.098]  Where do I get one?
[01:15:12.098 --> 01:15:13.159]  Yeah, it's good to have it on now.
[01:15:13.789 --> 01:15:17.331]  Well, we sold out of t-shirts during this bankruptcy, but now the bankruptcy is going well.
[01:15:17.331 --> 01:15:20.013]  We're getting back on our feet in the reorganization plan.
[01:15:20.013 --> 01:15:20.894]  Not a liquidation, folks.
[01:15:20.894 --> 01:15:22.175]  It's a reorganization.
[01:15:22.175 --> 01:15:25.017]  And so I'm glad to tell you we got the money for some t-shirts.
[01:15:25.017 --> 01:15:30.680]  So we're going to bring some new designs to InfoWareStore.com in the next few weeks.
[01:15:30.680 --> 01:15:31.261]  They should be here.
[01:15:31.841 --> 01:15:38.367]  And then we can take all the profit from that shirt and buy a few more shirts and bring back a whole new line of clothing.
[01:15:38.367 --> 01:15:42.091]  But boy, we've been this close to being shut down, but we're kind of clawing our way out of this.
[01:15:42.091 --> 01:15:42.932]  Thanks to all of you.
[01:15:42.932 --> 01:15:44.713]  Thank you so much, Mike.
[01:15:44.713 --> 01:15:47.976]  Clint, in Minnesota, when we come back, I'm going right to you.
[01:15:47.976 --> 01:15:54.102]  And then Tony, Justin, Donna, Mark, Mike, Dave, all your calls are coming up.
[01:15:54.102 --> 01:15:54.242]  877-789-ALEX.
[01:15:59.778 --> 01:16:02.899]  I talk a lot about the great successes InfoWars has had.
[01:16:02.899 --> 01:16:05.200]  I don't think anybody can deny it.
[01:16:05.200 --> 01:16:09.142]  And it is because of listeners and viewers supporting us.
[01:16:09.142 --> 01:16:18.065]  When we talk about the crew at InfoWars, people behind the scenes, the researchers, the writers, they really have been the MVPs in this fight.
[01:16:18.065 --> 01:16:25.868]  And when you look at Harrison Smith and Owen Schroer and the hard work they engage in every day, five, six, seven days a week, it's really just incredible.
[01:16:26.886 --> 01:16:29.768]  So for myself and the whole InfoWars crew, I thank you for your past support.
[01:16:29.768 --> 01:16:36.311]  I only encourage you now to realize that InfoWars cannot stay on air if you do not support us.
[01:16:36.311 --> 01:16:39.353]  I know you spread the word, I know you pray for us, and that's wonderful, keep doing it.
[01:16:39.353 --> 01:16:47.598]  But most viewers and listeners, never go to InfoWarsStore.com, and you never buy great products that enrich and empower your life, while at the same time keeping us on air.
[01:16:48.278 --> 01:16:52.581]  I know that less than 1% of our listeners actually go buy products at InfoWarsware.com.
[01:16:52.581 --> 01:16:57.525]  If just 1% more of you took action and went to InfoWarsware.com, our funding problems will be over.
[01:16:57.525 --> 01:16:58.566]  Please take action now.
[01:16:58.566 --> 01:17:00.247]  You want to beat the New World Order?
[01:17:00.247 --> 01:17:02.108]  You want to stop their globalist agenda?
[01:17:02.108 --> 01:17:10.214]  Well, so do I. And I've been the most effective individual in the fight against the globalists, and I've got their number, and I know how to bring them down.
[01:17:10.214 --> 01:17:10.934]  But ladies and gentlemen,
[01:17:11.915 --> 01:17:14.318]  I can't do it without your support.
[01:17:14.318 --> 01:17:18.882]  And the good news is, we're only under about $200,000 a month.
[01:17:18.882 --> 01:17:23.546]  The bad news is, the enemy is intensifying their attacks on every front, but I'm not gonna back down.
[01:17:23.546 --> 01:17:25.548]  And I'll never give up, but I could give out.
[01:17:25.548 --> 01:17:26.950]  So please, keep me on the field.
[01:17:27.370 --> 01:17:32.574]  Keep me on the front lines against the enemy while getting great products at the same time that will empower you and your family.
[01:17:32.574 --> 01:17:44.044]  InfoWarsTore.com for the best supplements and more, or just make a straight donation, big red banner at the top of InfoWarsTore.com, and that way all the money goes towards the fight, not part of it going towards product cost.
[01:17:44.044 --> 01:17:45.525]  But I thank you all for your support.
[01:17:45.525 --> 01:17:49.969]  Please commit now to go to InfoWarsTore.com and get great products and make donations.
[01:17:49.969 --> 01:17:50.929]  I thank you for your support.
[01:17:50.929 --> 01:17:52.150]  Now take action.
[01:17:52.150 --> 01:17:54.893]  The globalists are counting on you not taking action.

[01:18:58.380 --> 01:19:01.882]  The most banned man in America, Alex Jones.
[01:19:06.670 --> 01:19:08.011]  I want you all to know something.
[01:19:08.011 --> 01:19:09.972]  Alex Jones was right.
[01:19:09.972 --> 01:19:13.495]  Alex is right about far more than is wrong.
[01:19:13.495 --> 01:19:16.437]  Alex has been right on for over a decade.
[01:19:16.437 --> 01:19:20.900]  I don't care how you slice it, dice it, flip it up or rub it down.
[01:19:20.900 --> 01:19:23.082]  Alex Jones was right.
[01:19:23.082 --> 01:19:26.624]  Think about how frustrated we are if you've been awake for a year or two.
[01:19:26.624 --> 01:19:30.067]  Imagine being like an Alex Jones or those guys who've been awake for like decades.
[01:19:30.327 --> 01:19:33.209]  Alex Jones called this years ago.
[01:19:33.209 --> 01:19:34.249]  Years ago.
[01:19:34.249 --> 01:19:36.310]  Alex Jones never bought the Russia hoax.
[01:19:36.310 --> 01:19:38.311]  Not for a second.
[01:19:38.311 --> 01:19:40.833]  You are one of the great thinkers of this.
[01:19:40.833 --> 01:19:43.294]  You are a martyr to the First Amendment.
[01:19:43.294 --> 01:19:46.416]  The government fears Alex Jones.
[01:19:46.416 --> 01:19:47.977]  That's why the globalists hate me.
[01:19:47.977 --> 01:19:53.720]  It's because I'm exposing their corporate worldwide tyranny.
[01:19:53.720 --> 01:19:55.021]  AlexJonesLive.com
[01:20:01.030 --> 01:20:05.633]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[01:20:05.633 --> 01:20:10.596]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:20:10.596 --> 01:20:15.779]  Alright, welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:15.779 --> 01:20:18.340]  We're going right back to your calls.
[01:20:18.340 --> 01:20:22.202]  Talking about what's coming next as the whole New World Order agenda falls apart in front of our face.
[01:20:22.202 --> 01:20:22.823]  What are they going to do?
[01:20:22.823 --> 01:20:24.003]  They never give up.
[01:20:24.003 --> 01:20:25.524]  Clint in Minnesota, you're on the air.
[01:20:25.524 --> 01:20:27.666]  Thanks for calling.
[01:20:27.666 --> 01:20:28.426]  Alex!
[01:20:28.426 --> 01:20:28.726]  Yes, sir.
[01:20:28.726 --> 01:20:30.007]  It's great to be on your show.
[01:20:31.769 --> 01:20:33.170]  Great to have you.
[01:20:33.170 --> 01:20:36.394]  Yes, and before I get started, I just wanted to plug that DNA for us.
[01:20:36.394 --> 01:20:37.335]  That stuff is amazing.
[01:20:37.335 --> 01:20:46.785]  I've been taking that for a while, and I had myocarditis diagnosed about 20 years ago, and I'm telling you, that helps with my heart rhythmia really well.
[01:20:46.785 --> 01:20:53.492]  Of course, tinnitus is great, but anyways, getting back to the point here about Biden, I honestly think he's the last person.
[01:20:54.250 --> 01:21:05.719]  I submitted a video with your Operation Paul Revere a long time ago, when you had that going on, and at the end of the video, it ends with Biden and it says, get involved in politics unless you want the CCP to take over.
[01:21:05.719 --> 01:21:07.400]  And that's really where we're at right now.
[01:21:07.400 --> 01:21:13.385]  Other than that, it's a lovely day here in Minnesota, and there's not one airplane in the sky.
[01:21:13.385 --> 01:21:15.587]  What do you think the Globos are going to pull next?
[01:21:19.387 --> 01:21:19.867]  I don't know.
[01:21:19.867 --> 01:21:23.789]  And I think that speech last night by Biden was the calm before the storm.
[01:21:23.789 --> 01:21:31.552]  I mean, if you've just been living in La La Land, you probably think everything's great, but they've been selling this country off left and right.
[01:21:31.552 --> 01:21:32.112]  Well, that's right.
[01:21:32.112 --> 01:21:33.192]  They've already sold it out.
[01:21:33.192 --> 01:21:37.894]  Now they need a big crisis, as Gregory said in his latest report.
[01:21:37.894 --> 01:21:39.255]  It's at Van.Video.
[01:21:39.255 --> 01:21:47.118]  The globalists need a new 9-11 as their reset to get us to submit to the new cash flow society, the new system they've already got primed and ready.
[01:21:48.118 --> 01:22:01.002]  Yeah, I'm real curious about that, too, because we got a contract coming up with our union in about two months, and I work for, you could say, the globalist, one of them, but I got to tell you, I don't know.
[01:22:01.002 --> 01:22:06.584]  I really don't know what's going to go on, but everybody just wants a little bit more pay, but half the people here at the plant are awake.
[01:22:07.099 --> 01:22:09.020]  And that's a good sign for America.
[01:22:09.020 --> 01:22:09.960]  The people are awake.
[01:22:09.960 --> 01:22:13.241]  It's just we got this media in the way that's lying all the time.
[01:22:13.241 --> 01:22:14.182]  And that's our biggest.
[01:22:14.182 --> 01:22:17.803]  So going back years ago, what was 10% of the plant awake and now it's 50%?
[01:22:17.803 --> 01:22:19.384]  I mean, is that what you're saying?
[01:22:19.384 --> 01:22:22.445]  I mean, yeah, I was the only one who didn't wear a mask.
[01:22:22.445 --> 01:22:24.766]  Half the people wear the mask on their nose or whatever.
[01:22:24.766 --> 01:22:27.667]  I actually got into a confrontation with the plant manager.
[01:22:27.667 --> 01:22:29.547]  I said, look, this is discrimination.
[01:22:29.547 --> 01:22:30.768]  I'm not wearing the mask.
[01:22:30.768 --> 01:22:31.468]  Okay.
[01:22:31.468 --> 01:22:33.589]  I'm outside working, you know, half the time I'm in here.
[01:22:34.741 --> 01:22:35.582]  I wish I was recording this.
[01:22:35.582 --> 01:22:36.642]  And he ended it right there.
[01:22:36.642 --> 01:22:37.442]  He didn't talk with me.
[01:22:37.442 --> 01:22:39.563]  He didn't harass me anymore about wearing the mask.
[01:22:39.563 --> 01:22:41.004]  By the way, I've got an example of that.
[01:22:41.004 --> 01:22:46.146]  In Scotland, this individual kidnapped and raped a little girl.
[01:22:46.146 --> 01:22:47.327]  And he was, quote, transgender.
[01:22:47.327 --> 01:22:49.308]  And the police said, we're not calling him transgender.
[01:22:49.308 --> 01:22:49.768]  We're done.
[01:22:49.768 --> 01:22:50.728]  He's a man.
[01:22:50.728 --> 01:22:52.629]  And that's how the dominoes start to fall.
[01:22:52.629 --> 01:22:58.112]  When people just say, we're done bowing to political correctness, and the whole house of cards comes down.
[01:22:58.112 --> 01:22:59.332]  Thanks for the call.
[01:22:59.332 --> 01:23:02.374]  Let's talk to Mark in Florida on what's coming next.
[01:23:02.374 --> 01:23:02.814]  Go ahead, Mark.
[01:23:04.059 --> 01:23:05.299]  Hello, my brother.
[01:23:05.299 --> 01:23:12.281]  First time caller, been watching you since the public access days and supporting you for the last several years.
[01:23:12.281 --> 01:23:13.761]  Welcome.
[01:23:13.761 --> 01:23:23.444]  We're facing trials and tribulations, but unlike most people that I run into that's awake, I'm highly optimistic.
[01:23:23.444 --> 01:23:28.025]  Back in October 2019, I was working in my garage and felt a tap on my shoulder.
[01:23:28.855 --> 01:23:30.497]  And I immediately thought it was my wife.
[01:23:30.497 --> 01:23:31.558]  She likes to surprise me.
[01:23:31.558 --> 01:23:33.179]  I got a good wife.
[01:23:33.179 --> 01:23:35.321]  And there was no one there.
[01:23:35.321 --> 01:23:36.663]  And then I heard a voice.
[01:23:36.663 --> 01:23:38.424]  Uh, we need you.
[01:23:38.424 --> 01:23:41.587]  I'm like, okay, I'm not drinking.
[01:23:41.587 --> 01:23:42.628]  I'm not doing anything.
[01:23:42.628 --> 01:23:47.993]  So for two weeks, I'm just like trying to fathom what all this, what this was.
[01:23:47.993 --> 01:23:49.955]  And it was nothing.
[01:23:49.955 --> 01:23:51.777]  I mean, it didn't make any sense to me.
[01:23:52.543 --> 01:23:56.947]  And so I finally told my wife that I believed something bad was coming.
[01:23:56.947 --> 01:24:01.351]  I told her I don't know what it is, but something bad is coming.
[01:24:01.351 --> 01:24:07.136]  And that, you know, just something came over me that I have to give myself over to God.
[01:24:07.136 --> 01:24:08.237]  When was this?
[01:24:08.237 --> 01:24:10.299]  You were in the garage working on something.
[01:24:10.299 --> 01:24:11.219]  October.
[01:24:11.219 --> 01:24:13.321]  October of 2019.
[01:24:13.321 --> 01:24:17.345]  And then literally, there was a tap and then you heard a voice.
[01:24:18.570 --> 01:24:24.832]  Yeah, I mean, I've had good, vivid dreams.
[01:24:24.832 --> 01:24:27.333]  Kind of like the dreams that you've said before.
[01:24:27.333 --> 01:24:32.154]  You know, my mom passed away, and I knew before she even passed away.
[01:24:32.154 --> 01:24:33.895]  Same thing with my grandmother.
[01:24:33.895 --> 01:24:34.915]  We know that's real.
[01:24:34.915 --> 01:24:37.316]  I only heard a voice like that one time.
[01:24:38.649 --> 01:24:42.632]  And I guess I was in danger because it was like the Holy Spirit, an angel, whatever it was.
[01:24:42.632 --> 01:24:47.675]  But I was a freshman in high school and they already put me on the varsity football team and I was not a good football player.
[01:24:47.675 --> 01:24:48.696]  So I don't know why they did that.
[01:24:48.696 --> 01:24:49.716]  I was getting run over.
[01:24:49.716 --> 01:24:50.757]  I was getting hurt.
[01:24:50.757 --> 01:24:51.958]  The football season had ended.
[01:24:51.958 --> 01:24:57.882]  We'd been working out in the field house and then I was going back into the showers.
[01:24:57.882 --> 01:25:00.544]  And before I went in to see one of the coaches in the main area,
[01:25:01.778 --> 01:25:06.443]  It was like a voice went, watch out, don't go in there.
[01:25:06.443 --> 01:25:12.170]  And this guy's cousin had attacked me for no reason.
[01:25:12.170 --> 01:25:18.336]  People fought a lot back then and I didn't mean to hit him like that, but I punched him and like tore his nose completely off.
[01:25:18.997 --> 01:25:21.478]  I mean, I felt really bad.
[01:25:21.478 --> 01:25:23.438]  So this guy was a varsity football player.
[01:25:23.438 --> 01:25:28.259]  I walked to the door, he jumps on my back, tries to break my neck, starts beating me in the head.
[01:25:28.259 --> 01:25:30.180]  I get him off me, he starts kicking his ass.
[01:25:30.180 --> 01:25:31.240]  The coaches come out and stop it.
[01:25:31.240 --> 01:25:38.142]  But that was the one time where I'm about to walk into there and it's like, I literally hear a voice go, don't go in there, look out.
[01:25:38.142 --> 01:25:39.322]  And I just ignored the voice.
[01:25:39.322 --> 01:25:40.983]  I was like, what the hell is that?
[01:25:40.983 --> 01:25:43.203]  And I walk in there and get attacked 10 seconds later.
[01:25:43.203 --> 01:25:45.804]  So there's definitely some stuff going on in this universe, brother.
[01:25:47.128 --> 01:25:47.988]  Oh, definitely.
[01:25:47.988 --> 01:25:54.811]  And like I said, you know, I told my wife after two weeks, I told my wife, you know, I'm like, hey, I'm not crazy.
[01:25:54.811 --> 01:25:58.233]  You don't have any kind of, you know, issues or what have you.
[01:25:58.233 --> 01:26:01.534]  I says, but something something's coming down the line.
[01:26:01.534 --> 01:26:02.675]  I don't know what it is.
[01:26:02.675 --> 01:26:09.598]  You know, and when a couple of months later, you know, through independent media, you know, COVID, we noticed was
[01:26:10.251 --> 01:26:11.011]  I know a very well-known
[01:26:32.463 --> 01:26:42.211]  Rockstar who doesn't use drugs very well known clean guy iconic and he was in Los Angeles in the 80s when the big quake hit and He'd done a nighttime gig.
[01:26:42.211 --> 01:26:42.751]  He was tired.
[01:26:42.751 --> 01:26:51.098]  It was the middle of the day whenever that earthquake hit and Something said wake up and he woke up and he literally saw an angel
[01:26:52.090 --> 01:26:53.531]  Hi Alex, I'm calling you from Angleton, Texas.
[01:26:53.531 --> 01:26:54.572]  Not far from Houston.
[01:26:54.572 --> 01:26:56.713]  And that's basically my question.
[01:27:21.519 --> 01:27:35.443]  You know, there's all this talk about EMPs and nukes and things like that, and being that Houston is, what, the fourth largest city in the country, you know, we're pretty prepared down here and, you know, we're trying to do all we can.
[01:27:35.443 --> 01:27:43.705]  But what do you think is the percentage of the fact that China or Russia would actually send an EMP our way or a nuke?
[01:27:44.642 --> 01:27:48.343]  I mean, we're already at war with Russia, so they can attack us any day now.
[01:27:48.343 --> 01:27:49.063]  The sky's the limit.
[01:27:49.063 --> 01:27:55.565]  I mean, we are in so much danger, I can't even... I mean, anything goes now, that's all I can say.
[01:27:55.565 --> 01:28:00.787]  Well, and in terms of, you know, being prepared, you can't be prepared for anything like that.
[01:28:00.787 --> 01:28:03.487]  We've never gone through anything like that.
[01:28:03.487 --> 01:28:11.770]  And in talking about Russia and China, I start to think about, you know, if they nuke us, or, you know, even the EMP,
[01:28:12.609 --> 01:28:14.730]  What does that benefit them?
[01:28:14.730 --> 01:28:20.573]  Because if they ruin all our infrastructure, how are they going to come in here and just take over?
[01:28:20.573 --> 01:28:25.416]  But, you know, they would have to fix everything, and then they have to deal with us.
[01:28:25.416 --> 01:28:27.257]  And, you know, what's your take on that?
[01:28:29.278 --> 01:28:36.661]  Well, that's the thing about a war, is people commit to it, they decide to destroy each other, and they'll think, well, we'll be in charge after, we'll figure it out then.
[01:28:36.661 --> 01:28:38.541]  And so I think you just answered your own question.
[01:28:38.541 --> 01:28:39.522]  It's insane.
[01:28:39.522 --> 01:28:50.546]  And even if you, EMP Shield, with Faraday Cage is what you've got, the power goes out in many areas, the public in days turn into like locusts, or army ants, and all hell breaks loose.
[01:28:50.546 --> 01:28:53.407]  So, I think we can all feel we're on the verge of something big, Donna.
[01:28:53.407 --> 01:28:54.487]  Thank you for the call, we'll be right back.
[01:28:58.703 --> 01:29:01.084]  Cavalry has arrived.

[01:29:22.449 --> 01:29:25.893]  A whole bunch of other ingredients, like turmeric, the list goes on and on.

[01:30:58.669 --> 01:31:04.391]  If you go to OnlineHealthNow.com, connect with trusted and unbiased doctors at the Wellness Company.
[01:31:04.391 --> 01:31:08.272]  And I tell you, I'm honored to be the Chief Scientific Officer of the company.
[01:31:08.272 --> 01:31:12.813]  I contribute with like so many else do there, so many wonderful doctors.
[01:31:12.813 --> 01:31:18.435]  Far and away the most popular product is Dr. Vandewater's Detoxification Supplement.
[01:31:18.575 --> 01:31:20.275]  That features natokinase.
[01:31:20.275 --> 01:31:22.616]  It's a natural proteolytic enzyme.
[01:31:22.616 --> 01:31:28.297]  This one is the only enzyme that we're aware of right now that dissolves the spike protein.
[01:31:28.297 --> 01:31:29.077]  This is very important.
[01:31:29.077 --> 01:31:34.118]  The spike protein is loaded in the body with the COVID-19 infection and definitely with the vaccines.
[01:31:34.118 --> 01:31:35.638]  People are low with the spike protein.
[01:31:35.638 --> 01:31:36.578]  They don't feel well.
[01:31:36.578 --> 01:31:38.279]  This is a potential solution.
[01:31:38.279 --> 01:31:41.339]  Hydroxychloroquine comes from a natural substance.
[01:31:41.339 --> 01:31:44.260]  So does ivermectin and now natokinase.
[01:31:44.260 --> 01:31:45.220]  Isn't it interesting?
[01:31:45.640 --> 01:31:51.742]  Natural substances, in a sense, combating this man-made disaster, SARS-CoV-2 and the vaccines.
[01:31:51.742 --> 01:31:56.244]  Onlinehealthnow.com, thank you for your support, and thank you for getting into that, because it's important.
[01:31:56.244 --> 01:31:58.345]  You didn't come here to do that, but I made you do it.
[01:31:58.345 --> 01:32:01.606]  They want the planet for themselves, my friends.
[01:32:01.606 --> 01:32:05.887]  And we're so stupid, we let them tell us we deserve it.
[01:32:05.887 --> 01:32:09.909]  Except children don't deserve it, do they?
[01:32:09.909 --> 01:32:11.649]  And I looked.
[01:32:15.395 --> 01:32:27.364]  And behold, a pale horse, and he that sat on the horse was named Death.
[01:32:27.364 --> 01:32:41.173]  Now the translation is, I looked, and behold a pale horse, and his name that sat on him was Death, and Hell followed with him.
[01:32:41.173 --> 01:32:43.255]  The Book of Revelation.
[01:32:45.307 --> 01:32:46.967]  Very serious times to be alive, folks.
[01:32:46.967 --> 01:32:48.668]  They're not just doing this as a one-off.
[01:32:48.668 --> 01:32:50.268]  This is the beginning of the rest of our lives.
[01:32:50.268 --> 01:32:51.588]  This is our fight.
[01:32:51.588 --> 01:32:52.949]  And I'm proud of humanity.
[01:32:52.949 --> 01:32:54.389]  The globalists even admit it's leaked.
[01:32:54.389 --> 01:33:01.031]  They're very upset that they're losing and that this hasn't gone the way they thought it would.
[01:33:01.031 --> 01:33:06.932]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:16.963 --> 01:33:21.944]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:33:21.944 --> 01:33:28.125]  Live from Freedom Command Central, it's the Alex Jones Show!
[01:33:28.125 --> 01:33:34.967]  So, anybody that says they're bored, or anybody that says consciousness is not important is a fool.
[01:33:34.967 --> 01:33:36.907]  You are made in the image of God.
[01:33:36.907 --> 01:33:42.568]  You are living on a fabulous planet, hurtling through deep space, orbiting a gigantic fireball.
[01:33:42.568 --> 01:33:43.369]  Wow!
[01:33:43.369 --> 01:33:45.009]  We're amazing creatures!
[01:33:48.160 --> 01:33:49.501]  And we're taking your phone calls.
[01:33:49.501 --> 01:33:57.326]  I'm going to get to Gayo Sex and this important Elon Musk news next segment, then continue all your calls into the third hour.
[01:33:57.326 --> 01:33:58.267]  But we're taking a lot of calls.
[01:33:58.267 --> 01:33:59.828]  We're doing a pretty good job, I think.
[01:33:59.828 --> 01:34:04.371]  David, California's an airline pilot on the vaccinations of other pilots.
[01:34:04.371 --> 01:34:11.096]  I ran into a couple of pilots that were listeners telling me all the problems with the shots when I was at the Austin airport a few weeks ago.
[01:34:11.096 --> 01:34:12.317]  What are you seeing, David?
[01:34:14.079 --> 01:34:15.440]  Hey Alex, good to talk to you.
[01:34:15.440 --> 01:34:16.641]  Thank you so much for having me on.
[01:34:16.641 --> 01:34:19.683]  Yes, Colleen from Southern California, deep behind the enemy lines here.
[01:34:19.683 --> 01:34:22.705]  You know, I'm an airline pilot.
[01:34:22.705 --> 01:34:24.006]  My wife's an airline pilot.
[01:34:24.006 --> 01:34:33.433]  I've been listening to you for a long time, so when it came out about the shots that, you know, as pilots we've all been taught to use critical thinking, so it was kind of a no-brainer not to take the shots.
[01:34:33.433 --> 01:34:43.441]  But, you know, with the airline that we both fly for, actually we both fly for different airlines, but, you know, we can definitely say that a good majority of pilots that didn't take the shot, so it was kind of
[01:34:44.036 --> 01:34:53.543]  It's kind of funny listening to or reading emails from our own company saying, like, oh, you better get the shots or they're calling vaccines because... And aren't you vindicated now that they're having to back off?
[01:34:53.543 --> 01:34:54.323]  Oh, completely.
[01:34:54.323 --> 01:34:56.244]  Yeah, no, I mean, no regrets, right?
[01:34:56.244 --> 01:34:56.665]  Obviously.
[01:34:56.665 --> 01:35:02.108]  And it's funny, every pilot that I talk to, there's not a single pilot that's like, oh, yeah, I never took the shot, but Joe Biden's a good guy.
[01:35:02.108 --> 01:35:04.850]  And the World Economic Forum, they're good people and they should be in charge.
[01:35:04.850 --> 01:35:08.733]  No, every pilot I've talked to that hasn't taken the shots, we all know what's going on.
[01:35:08.733 --> 01:35:09.534]  All of them are awake.
[01:35:10.586 --> 01:35:12.008]  I'm so glad I didn't take the shot.
[01:35:12.008 --> 01:35:14.090]  Now, I do know of a couple other pipes that did take the shot.
[01:35:14.090 --> 01:35:20.656]  One individual who's in his mid-20s, he was applying for the Navy or something.
[01:35:20.656 --> 01:35:23.559]  Anyway, good, healthy kid.
[01:35:23.559 --> 01:35:30.947]  He played basketball, water polo, and he obviously had to get the shot just to be able to try and get the job flying for the military.
[01:35:31.394 --> 01:35:36.396]  And ended up with a heart problem, and they basically screwed him, and now he's trying to get his F.A.
[01:35:36.396 --> 01:35:38.777]  medical back, and he's having a really hard time.
[01:35:38.777 --> 01:35:42.198]  So again, how do you attack America and the West without them knowing?
[01:35:42.198 --> 01:35:49.421]  You do it through a so-called medical system, where you know the medical system will want to cover it up, even though they weren't conscious of it on average.
[01:35:49.421 --> 01:35:56.424]  They'll want to cover it up just through self-preservation, and by that act, they then fully corrupt the medical system and can prepare an even bigger lie.
[01:35:58.115 --> 01:35:58.935]  Absolutely.
[01:35:58.935 --> 01:36:01.537]  And I really want to take this moment to thank you so much.
[01:36:01.537 --> 01:36:08.820]  My wife and I thank you so much for the information you put out, you know, years ago, because I, you know, I, I'm, my wife's way smarter than I am.
[01:36:08.820 --> 01:36:13.282]  I probably would have fallen for it if I hadn't been so, you know, paying attention to what was going on.
[01:36:13.282 --> 01:36:18.564]  So, you know, as a big thank you, you know, we've purchased X2 DNA Force.
[01:36:18.564 --> 01:36:22.806]  You know, Turbo Force is great, you know, especially for a pilot flying red eyes all the time, stay up all night.
[01:36:22.806 --> 01:36:23.426]  That's awesome.
[01:36:23.426 --> 01:36:25.267]  And then down and out to use that at the end of a trip.
[01:36:25.666 --> 01:36:28.589]  To go to sleep in the middle of the day, which I hate that they make us do that.
[01:36:28.589 --> 01:36:30.390]  But anyway, so it's taken down and out, that works.
[01:36:30.390 --> 01:36:33.293]  I've got multiple t-shirts, all the coins, I bought three of each.
[01:36:33.293 --> 01:36:35.835]  I've got your book, three of those, got one of them signed.
[01:36:35.835 --> 01:36:38.297]  Well, brother, you're the reason we're still on air.
[01:36:38.297 --> 01:36:46.164]  It's the super listener like you that's kept us on air, and I'm just trying to be as faithful as I can and keep this operation on air, and we couldn't do it without you.
[01:36:46.164 --> 01:36:48.086]  So God bless you, sir, and be safe.
[01:36:48.086 --> 01:36:48.927]  Wow, great caller.
[01:36:48.927 --> 01:36:50.208]  All the calls are amazing.
[01:36:50.208 --> 01:36:51.409]  Mike in New York, go ahead.
[01:36:52.879 --> 01:36:53.719]  Alex, good afternoon.
[01:36:53.719 --> 01:36:54.740]  Thanks for taking my call.
[01:36:54.740 --> 01:36:55.500]  I love you, man.
[01:36:55.500 --> 01:36:56.860]  Love you, too.
[01:36:56.860 --> 01:37:01.522]  Listen, Alex, I'm an active member of Alcoholics Anonymous for 28 years.
[01:37:01.522 --> 01:37:14.106]  In this rotten state of New York, what they have done, you can Google this on any search engine, they've created governing boards with starting salaries of $350,000 to infiltrate our meetings.
[01:37:14.106 --> 01:37:16.527]  And what they're doing, they're sending in their operatives
[01:37:17.105 --> 01:37:24.666]  To get these people off the streets and out of rehabs and send them to methadone clinics, get them on Suboxone, tell them they don't need AA.
[01:37:24.666 --> 01:37:26.267]  They're rewriting our literature.
[01:37:26.267 --> 01:37:26.647]  Oh, I know.
[01:37:26.647 --> 01:37:28.727]  They're going after every independent good group.
[01:37:28.727 --> 01:37:32.308]  They're trying to take over the Salvation Army, AA, all the good groups.
[01:37:32.308 --> 01:37:34.408]  I know about that.
[01:37:34.408 --> 01:37:39.409]  And what they're doing is, their main objective, they want to take God out of our literature.
[01:37:39.409 --> 01:37:40.849]  And that is the main purpose.
[01:37:40.849 --> 01:37:43.330]  Oh, you see the Church of England is getting rid of God entirely.
[01:37:43.330 --> 01:37:43.810]  Exactly.
[01:37:43.810 --> 01:37:44.290]  Wow.
[01:37:45.848 --> 01:37:51.194]  And the last thing I'd like to say, Alex, there's a meeting in Lake George, New York tonight at 7 o'clock.
[01:37:51.194 --> 01:37:52.296]  It's a GSR meeting.
[01:37:52.296 --> 01:37:54.618]  If any of your listeners are active members of AA,
[01:37:55.464 --> 01:38:06.752]  You need to go to this meeting with a bullhorn and give them all the shit you can because they are destroying the most vulnerable people who are trying to get off their feet and get their lives together.
[01:38:06.752 --> 01:38:07.873]  But talk about this more.
[01:38:07.873 --> 01:38:14.117]  They don't want people to find God, which all the statistics, whether you believe in God or not, is the best way to get people off drugs and alcohol.
[01:38:14.117 --> 01:38:15.618]  I know folks are in AA.
[01:38:15.618 --> 01:38:16.179]  I'm not perfect.
[01:38:16.179 --> 01:38:17.420]  I got my own issues.
[01:38:17.420 --> 01:38:19.021]  Only God can get you out of this.
[01:38:19.021 --> 01:38:20.242]  And they're trying to remove that.
[01:38:21.043 --> 01:38:27.341]  So describe what's happening with government-sponsored infiltration to take over some of the best organizations.
[01:38:28.925 --> 01:38:40.136]  What they're doing is they're sending in people, they've changed the literature now, so if you Googled any meeting to go to, it used to be certain meetings were closed just to alcoholics.
[01:38:40.136 --> 01:38:46.362]  Now they've changed the wording to all people are welcome to AA, whether you're an alcoholic or not, and that's okay.
[01:38:46.362 --> 01:38:50.847]  But the people that they're sending in are literally agents of the New World Order.
[01:38:51.367 --> 01:38:54.629]  And if this doesn't stop, AA will be done.
[01:38:54.629 --> 01:38:56.270]  And that's their main job to do that.
[01:38:56.270 --> 01:38:56.790]  Well, that's it.
[01:38:56.790 --> 01:38:58.811]  They want everybody drugged and poisoned.
[01:38:58.811 --> 01:39:00.072]  Where is this meeting tonight?
[01:39:00.072 --> 01:39:01.993]  And why is people protesting?
[01:39:01.993 --> 01:39:03.474]  It's in Lake George, New York.
[01:39:03.474 --> 01:39:04.654]  It's a GSR meeting.
[01:39:04.654 --> 01:39:14.400]  And what they're doing, they're going to announce their new way of AA, NA, whatever it is, their new way in New York State that they want people to recover.
[01:39:14.400 --> 01:39:16.681]  And it's disgusting and it has to stop.
[01:39:16.681 --> 01:39:17.942]  So how do people find it?
[01:39:17.942 --> 01:39:20.223]  How do they find the building or where it's at?
[01:39:21.328 --> 01:39:35.971]  You Google AA meeting, Lake George, New York tonight, GSR meeting, group service meeting, so any members of AA can go there and give your opinion to these people because they're going to lay out their new agenda for what they want to do.
[01:39:35.971 --> 01:39:39.032]  Well, sure, but they're doing it to every institution, especially the churches.
[01:39:39.032 --> 01:39:39.572]  Thank you, sir.
[01:39:39.572 --> 01:39:41.773]  All right, let's jam another caller in here.
[01:39:41.773 --> 01:39:43.393]  Let's go to Tony in New Hampshire.
[01:39:43.393 --> 01:39:45.394]  Go ahead.
[01:39:45.394 --> 01:39:46.594]  Hey, Alex, can you hear me?
[01:39:46.594 --> 01:39:46.934]  I can.
[01:39:46.934 --> 01:39:48.594]  Thank you.
[01:39:48.594 --> 01:39:50.395]  Hey, Alex, thank you so much for everything.
[01:39:51.323 --> 01:39:53.724]  I just want to say I'm up here in New Hampshire.
[01:39:53.724 --> 01:39:55.064]  It's crazy town here.
[01:39:55.064 --> 01:40:01.886]  I actually just moved to New Hampshire to get out of Massachusetts because everybody's nuts.
[01:40:01.886 --> 01:40:02.986]  So I'm new to you.
[01:40:02.986 --> 01:40:08.948]  I listen to you every day and I hear you talk about, all right, people get ready, prepare.
[01:40:08.948 --> 01:40:16.390]  But aside from, you know, the obvious stocking up on food, water, medicine, what else can I do?
[01:40:17.701 --> 01:40:21.288]  Lately, I keep thinking, okay, do I just take all my money out of the bank?
[01:40:21.288 --> 01:40:21.749]  Then what?
[01:40:21.749 --> 01:40:22.891]  Do I keep it at my house?
[01:40:22.891 --> 01:40:23.913]  Do I buy gold?
[01:40:23.913 --> 01:40:24.494]  What do I do?
[01:40:25.698 --> 01:40:32.063]  And I know there's a lot of things that can happen, whether it be with the globalists, or a cyber attack, or... I would tell you this.
[01:40:32.063 --> 01:40:44.353]  I would hedge your bets, and I would spread things out, and I would find like-minded people that know what's going on, because this is a biblical assault on society, on civilization and humanity.
[01:40:44.353 --> 01:40:45.534]  And I don't have the answers, too.
[01:40:45.534 --> 01:40:47.196]  I sit there with my wife and my family.
[01:40:48.171 --> 01:40:50.412]  We all know what's going down and we're just like, what do we do?
[01:40:50.412 --> 01:40:53.814]  Do we just stay here in a major city and keep fighting?
[01:40:53.814 --> 01:40:56.135]  Which we decided to do because of the work we're doing.
[01:40:56.135 --> 01:40:57.856]  But if people aren't doing this work, I would...
[01:40:58.891 --> 01:40:59.211]  Okay.
[01:41:23.027 --> 01:41:24.147]  All right, well thank you so much.
[01:41:24.147 --> 01:41:25.528]  Keep doing what you do.
[01:41:25.528 --> 01:41:26.028]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:41:26.028 --> 01:41:28.768]  Well, I'm trying, but what are you seeing in New Hampshire?
[01:41:28.768 --> 01:41:37.050]  You're saying Massachusetts was crazy town and just everybody's under the New World Order, but is it good or bad in New Hampshire?
[01:41:37.050 --> 01:41:43.771]  New Hampshire is just slightly better than Massachusetts, but in Massachusetts I still work there.
[01:41:43.771 --> 01:41:46.832]  Everybody at the store is still wearing masks.
[01:41:46.832 --> 01:41:51.333]  I have a friend of mine who now has heart problems after getting the shot.
[01:41:52.253 --> 01:41:56.379]  And I keep telling him that it's from the shots and he says, no, no, no.
[01:41:56.379 --> 01:41:59.042]  My doctor said it's because I had a cold.
[01:41:59.042 --> 01:42:01.806]  And I mean, these people... Oh yeah, normal to have a heart attack now.
[01:42:01.806 --> 01:42:02.868]  Yeah, no, it's so sad.
[01:42:02.868 --> 01:42:06.373]  So just warn them and move on because they're under a strong delusion.
[01:42:06.373 --> 01:42:07.875]  He will take shots till he dies.
[01:42:09.272 --> 01:42:09.933]  You can't help them.
[01:42:09.933 --> 01:42:10.794]  I'm sorry.
[01:42:10.794 --> 01:42:11.274]  You tried.
[01:42:11.274 --> 01:42:14.016]  They just can't admit the system's out to get them.
[01:42:14.016 --> 01:42:14.816]  They love this idea.
[01:42:14.816 --> 01:42:16.217]  They're heroes.
[01:42:16.217 --> 01:42:17.659]  They're protecting people.
[01:42:17.659 --> 01:42:19.600]  Oh, they're smart.
[01:42:19.600 --> 01:42:20.721]  They believe in the science.
[01:42:20.721 --> 01:42:24.243]  And even though all of it's come out, they still can't admit it.
[01:42:24.243 --> 01:42:26.345]  So just move on to others you can save.
[01:42:26.345 --> 01:42:27.726]  You've got a triage situation.
[01:42:27.726 --> 01:42:29.167]  Thanks for the call.
[01:42:29.167 --> 01:42:30.528]  Well, we're getting to a lot of calls here.
[01:42:32.048 --> 01:42:37.469]  I want Dave and Rod and Peter and Vincent and Alan and Carlos and Justin.
[01:42:37.469 --> 01:42:38.369]  Stay there.
[01:42:38.369 --> 01:42:46.391]  But I gotta hit this JSX situation with Elon Musk when we come back.
[01:42:46.391 --> 01:42:52.452]  Then I've got the World ID system being openly announced and so much more that will continue on with your phone calls.
[01:42:52.452 --> 01:42:54.253]  InfoWars.com.
[01:42:54.253 --> 01:42:55.733]  Tomorrow's news today.
[01:42:55.733 --> 01:42:56.113]  Stay with us.
[01:42:58.643 --> 01:43:00.826]  There is a war on for your mind.
[01:43:00.826 --> 01:43:02.628]  Your mind is a battlefield.
[01:43:02.628 --> 01:43:04.691]  This is an information war.
[01:43:04.691 --> 01:43:09.378]  Infowars popularized those terms more than two decades ago.
[01:43:09.378 --> 01:43:15.867]  And today, whether it's Donald Trump, or Governor DeSantis, or Dr. Robert Malone, they're all using the terms.
[01:43:16.307 --> 01:43:17.068]  We're good to go.
[01:43:37.878 --> 01:43:45.805]  But every time you donate money, every time you buy products, every time you keep us on air, you are literally, non-violently, politically, punching the New World Order in the nose.
[01:43:45.805 --> 01:43:48.148]  Punching their lies in the nose.
[01:43:48.148 --> 01:43:49.969]  We are going to defeat the New World Order.
[01:43:49.969 --> 01:43:51.110]  We're going over the top.
[01:43:51.110 --> 01:43:52.612]  But right now is the critical juncture.
[01:43:52.612 --> 01:43:55.675]  So please go to InfoWarsTore.com and donate now!
[01:44:00.182 --> 01:44:04.544]  Cobra Commander here with an important message to humanity.
[01:44:04.544 --> 01:44:12.867]  I have decided that all of you will take a special injection so that you will be safe.
[01:44:12.867 --> 01:44:16.408]  But the injection is not ready yet.
[01:44:16.408 --> 01:44:24.992]  And so, I need all of you to stay indoors for the next 15 days to flatten the curve.
[01:44:25.772 --> 01:44:33.915]  I also need you to wear masks, and I also need you to only shop at megacorporations.
[01:44:33.915 --> 01:44:44.098]  That way we can consolidate control and bankrupt the world economy, leaving companies that only I own profitable.
[01:44:44.098 --> 01:44:46.839]  You will then be my slaves.
[01:44:46.839 --> 01:44:46.979]  Only.
[01:44:47.612 --> 01:44:51.737]  And then you'll get that special shot of venom from Cobra.
[01:44:51.737 --> 01:44:57.505]  It will remove your immune system, so you'll be dependent on me for the rest of your miserable lives.
[01:44:58.484 --> 01:45:01.826]  Everybody that's watching this needs to support Alex Jones.
[01:45:01.826 --> 01:45:04.667]  Needs to support InfoWars and Band.Video.
[01:45:04.667 --> 01:45:07.389]  You know, the Bible says, let another mouth praise you.
[01:45:07.389 --> 01:45:08.669]  I'm gonna do that right now.
[01:45:08.669 --> 01:45:12.571]  Alex Jones has helped so many people in this industry.
[01:45:12.571 --> 01:45:17.454]  You guys have no idea how many people have got their first start like Savannah Hernandez.
[01:45:17.774 --> 01:45:23.937]  How many people have just been put on a launch pad to outer space because of Alex Jones, including myself?
[01:45:23.937 --> 01:45:32.582]  I've been given so many opportunities because of this man and because of this platform, and I would probably not even be half of where I am right now if it weren't for Alex Jones.
[01:45:32.582 --> 01:45:38.265]  I mean, I've been able to be on podcasts with Alex and Joe Rogan and TimCast, the super TimCast IRL.
[01:45:38.265 --> 01:45:43.688]  Listen, what I'm saying is, do not take Alex Jones and Bandot video for granted.
[01:45:43.908 --> 01:45:46.409]  Because you don't know what you have until it's gone.
[01:45:46.409 --> 01:45:49.110]  We need to support free speech systems right now.
[01:45:49.110 --> 01:45:50.590]  So go check out the store.
[01:45:50.590 --> 01:45:51.771]  Go support their store.
[01:45:51.771 --> 01:45:53.271]  Go support InfoWars.
[01:45:53.271 --> 01:45:54.631]  Leave a donation right now.
[01:45:54.631 --> 01:45:58.553]  Don't wait until they're gone!
[01:45:58.553 --> 01:46:11.097]  In the year 2000, Alex Jones' film, Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove, showed the world how our so-called elite leaders practice mock ritual sacrifices in private.
[01:46:13.867 --> 01:46:24.114]  In 2007, Alex Jones releases Endgame, exposing the world elite's plans for covertly using biological weapons against all of mankind.
[01:46:24.114 --> 01:46:35.964]  And by the time they launched their attack in 2020, Alex Jones' InfoWars and our audience were there to warn the people of the deadly vaccines that we knew were coming.
[01:46:35.964 --> 01:46:37.485]  This is why they attack us.
[01:46:37.965 --> 01:46:40.467]  This is why we need your support.
[01:46:40.467 --> 01:46:42.288]  Because we tell the truth.
[01:46:42.288 --> 01:46:44.489]  Alex Jones was right.
[01:46:44.489 --> 01:46:45.930]  Join the resistance.
[01:46:45.930 --> 01:46:47.230]  Buy products.
[01:46:47.230 --> 01:46:49.011]  Donate to the cause.
[01:46:49.011 --> 01:46:50.392]  Share the links.
[01:46:50.392 --> 01:46:52.814]  Join us in the fight for freedom.
[01:46:52.814 --> 01:47:01.318]  And help us defeat the New World Order.
[01:47:01.318 --> 01:47:05.941]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[01:47:05.941 --> 01:47:07.222]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:47:18.932 --> 01:47:24.413]  As I said earlier, anybody that thinks they're living in a boring world is crazy.
[01:47:24.413 --> 01:47:30.954]  We're living in the most critical time in human existence right now.
[01:47:30.954 --> 01:47:33.435]  And yes, there are forces of evil in the universe.
[01:47:33.435 --> 01:47:38.436]  There's also all-powerful force of good, but we've got to dial into it.
[01:47:38.436 --> 01:47:41.336]  Taking your phone calls, coming up next hour.
[01:47:41.336 --> 01:47:44.137]  For everybody that's patiently holding, that's only about 12 minutes away.
[01:47:45.512 --> 01:47:49.776]  I want to go ahead and hit this report that's on Infowars.com.
[01:47:49.776 --> 01:47:52.258]  It's not supposed to be real.
[01:47:52.258 --> 01:48:00.626]  Elon Musk highlights 20-year-old video game that predicted a globalist takeover.
[01:48:00.626 --> 01:48:02.168]  Deus Ex.
[01:48:02.168 --> 01:48:05.010]  Deus Ex.
[01:48:05.010 --> 01:48:06.552]  And he goes through how the game
[01:48:07.878 --> 01:48:14.223]  Predicted that governments would release a bioweapon for political control.
[01:48:14.223 --> 01:48:24.350]  He goes on to say, the game titled Deus Ex was released in the summer of 2000, at the time seeming like pure science fiction, but now it looks disturbingly prophetic.
[01:48:24.350 --> 01:48:32.936]  It's not supposed to be real, tweeted Elon Musk Monday with the game box art.
[01:48:32.936 --> 01:48:34.197]  We don't want to talk more about it.
[01:48:35.336 --> 01:48:38.460]  The game takes place in the year 2052.
[01:48:38.460 --> 01:48:42.785]  Full articles on InfoWars.com.
[01:48:42.785 --> 01:48:46.629]  The cover of the game almost looks like Elon Musk looking up into the sky.
[01:48:50.114 --> 01:48:51.695]  When I saw this, I went, well, wait a minute.
[01:48:51.695 --> 01:48:52.976]  I talked to the creators of it.
[01:48:52.976 --> 01:48:54.117]  They were going to make a new version.
[01:48:54.117 --> 01:48:55.438]  They wanted me to be in it.
[01:48:55.438 --> 01:48:57.519]  And for some reason, that never happened.
[01:48:57.519 --> 01:48:59.960]  You've got humans merged with cyborgs.
[01:48:59.960 --> 01:49:02.222]  You've got this whole future system.
[01:49:02.222 --> 01:49:03.223]  You've got FEMA camps.
[01:49:03.223 --> 01:49:05.244]  You've got forced injections.
[01:49:05.244 --> 01:49:07.605]  You've got everything in it.
[01:49:07.605 --> 01:49:16.151]  And of course, InfoWars, the one I was covering, was one of the main emphases for the game, the hit game that was Underground Game.
[01:49:16.151 --> 01:49:18.272]  But I just noticed that Elon Musk is out there
[01:49:19.298 --> 01:49:27.343]  Bringing this up like it's so prophetic, but he knows, meanwhile, it's base, because you type in Alex Jones, Deus Ex, it's everywhere.
[01:49:27.343 --> 01:49:38.249]  You have the creators talking about me being a big influence, you have it all going on, but then still the person that warned about all this is Prasada Nangrata on Twitter, and I'm not lobbying to get back on Twitter.
[01:49:39.465 --> 01:49:42.128]  The point is, is that why is Musk doing this?
[01:49:42.128 --> 01:49:47.774]  Why is he endorsing a game that exposed it, but not the films and documentaries I made that went through it?
[01:49:47.774 --> 01:49:56.344]  So here's some of the pop art made around myself and Deus Ex, and then some of the clips from the actual game.
[01:49:59.142 --> 01:50:02.845]  I trust you've been able to find yourself a place within the organization?
[01:50:02.845 --> 01:50:05.308]  I'm personally overseeing the distribution of the vaccine.
[01:50:05.308 --> 01:50:07.369]  All through the proper intermediaries, of course.
[01:50:07.369 --> 01:50:09.191]  Intermediaries?
[01:50:09.191 --> 01:50:14.215]  We have a great number of... agencies, who in turn operate other agencies.
[01:50:14.215 --> 01:50:15.997]  Boxes stacked one and another.
[01:50:15.997 --> 01:50:20.821]  They'll need to be reactivated, but we never touch anything directly.
[01:50:20.821 --> 01:50:24.144]  We only influence, suggest, insinuate.
[01:50:24.847 --> 01:50:28.229]  The entire executive branch is handpicked.
[01:50:28.229 --> 01:50:29.590]  19 of the last 23 U.S.
[01:50:29.590 --> 01:50:32.831]  presidents have been members of the Trilateral Commission.
[01:50:32.831 --> 01:50:36.954]  The Trilateral Commission is financed by the Rockefellers and the Rothschilds.
[01:50:36.954 --> 01:50:47.940]  Let's get back to what we know about Prague and what we always know when it comes to false flag situations, like Gulf of Tompkins and the Reichstag, like 9-11 and the Aug incident before this.
[01:50:50.747 --> 01:50:51.547]  Ask me?
[01:50:51.547 --> 01:50:53.148]  I think the government did it.
[01:50:53.148 --> 01:50:55.848]  They want people to think the NSF are terrorists.
[01:50:55.848 --> 01:51:00.149]  I think the government made the plague on purpose to get rid of the population growth.
[01:51:00.149 --> 01:51:02.450]  People know the government has a vaccine.
[01:51:02.450 --> 01:51:04.030]  Riots everywhere.
[01:51:04.030 --> 01:51:07.771]  The same corporation that makes Ambrosia also manufactures the virus.
[01:51:07.771 --> 01:51:08.931]  Quite convenient.
[01:51:08.931 --> 01:51:10.992]  They're infecting people on purpose, huh?
[01:51:10.992 --> 01:51:13.012]  Executive Order 10990.
[01:51:13.012 --> 01:51:16.753]  It lets us take over all modes of transportation.
[01:51:16.753 --> 01:51:17.513]  FEMA can do that?
[01:51:18.360 --> 01:51:20.806]  If the President declares an emergency, Executive Order 10995.
[01:51:20.806 --> 01:51:21.568]  We can take over the media.
[01:51:21.568 --> 01:51:21.768]  All of it?
[01:51:25.427 --> 01:51:26.088]  Any and all.
[01:51:26.088 --> 01:51:36.797]  Need I remind you that in the case of a national emergency, FEMA has a list of six million Americans who will be transported to detention centers?
[01:51:36.797 --> 01:51:39.179]  Your tabloids call it RX-84.
[01:51:39.179 --> 01:51:44.424]  Yeah, including the President, Congress, and the Supreme Court.
[01:51:44.424 --> 01:51:48.787]  In my position, I find it very easy to add names to that list.
[01:51:49.749 --> 01:51:55.979]  The whole project of world government going back to the League of Nations has been funded and manipulated mainly by wealthy bankers.
[01:51:55.979 --> 01:52:00.386]  Remember that the UN itself was built on land donated by John D. Rockefeller.
[01:52:00.386 --> 01:52:01.208]  They will never stop!
[01:52:02.196 --> 01:52:06.398]  All dropped into isolationist ghettos, just like Gollum City, followers.
[01:52:06.398 --> 01:52:13.260]  This attack expedites legislation that, in time, will be expanded to include naturals.
[01:52:13.260 --> 01:52:19.603]  It'll guarantee legislation that will make the distribution and implantation of chips mandatory.
[01:52:19.603 --> 01:52:24.064]  Chips that will eventually be implanted in our natural asses, too.
[01:52:24.064 --> 01:52:27.826]  I told you an attack like this was imminent and people called me paranoid.
[01:52:27.826 --> 01:52:31.047]  Well, what do you think now, at conspiracy underscore
[01:52:32.998 --> 01:52:35.220]  The world must know by now, Everett.
[01:52:35.220 --> 01:52:37.481]  What we've done, know what?
[01:52:37.481 --> 01:52:39.663]  Only that the long night is over.
[01:52:39.663 --> 01:52:41.944]  The crown of government is tarnished.
[01:52:41.944 --> 01:52:43.365]  But that will fade in time.
[01:52:43.365 --> 01:52:46.748]  The wealthy have always been the ones to profit from one world government.
[01:52:46.748 --> 01:52:53.032]  The United Nations' secret goal... Well, this is David Rockefeller's description from a half a century ago.
[01:52:53.032 --> 01:52:56.255]  The supranational sovereignty of an intellectual elite and world bankers.
[01:52:58.709 --> 01:53:00.951]  Are we protecting ourselves from them?
[01:53:00.951 --> 01:53:04.154]  Or are they protecting themselves from us?
[01:53:04.154 --> 01:53:07.016]  Gotta admit, I'm conflicted.
[01:53:07.016 --> 01:53:09.598]  Executive Order 10997.
[01:53:09.598 --> 01:53:11.620]  We can take command of natural resources.
[01:53:11.620 --> 01:53:14.563]  Some people just don't understand the dangers of indiscriminate surveillance.
[01:53:16.292 --> 01:53:17.293]  You haven't heard of RX-84?
[01:53:17.293 --> 01:53:17.493]  Uh-huh.
[01:53:17.493 --> 01:53:20.476]  FEMA takes over the highways, police, airports, media, the armed forces.
[01:53:20.476 --> 01:53:23.098]  But they still report to the President, right?
[01:53:23.098 --> 01:53:26.061]  Not until the end of the emergency.
[01:53:44.421 --> 01:53:45.142]  Who are we?
[01:53:45.142 --> 01:53:46.462]  Who are we really?
[01:53:46.462 --> 01:53:48.844]  We are the Invisible Hand.
[01:54:10.282 --> 01:54:11.982]  We are the Illuminati.
[01:54:11.982 --> 01:54:14.743]  We come before and after.
[01:54:14.743 --> 01:54:16.223]  We are forever.
[01:54:16.223 --> 01:54:21.345]  And eventually, eventually, we will lead them into the day.
[01:54:21.345 --> 01:54:24.025]  I've done what you asked.
[01:54:24.025 --> 01:54:25.026]  Now what?
[01:54:25.026 --> 01:54:27.926]  I want freedom and space exploration for the next renaissance.
[01:54:27.926 --> 01:54:30.827]  I don't care if nobody ever knows my name.
[01:54:41.399 --> 01:54:46.665]  And if I do?
[01:54:47.859 --> 01:54:49.259]  What becomes of me?
[01:54:49.259 --> 01:54:53.141]  This is what I was made for, isn't it?
[01:55:19.065 --> 01:55:27.672]  Well, the point is people are awake and the new order is not going to be able to stop that unless they kill everybody.
[01:55:27.672 --> 01:55:35.158]  And imagine the fools that have signed on to this system that are still defending it even as it destroys their very future.
[01:55:35.158 --> 01:55:42.845]  I'm going to start the third hour here in a moment and we're going to go to the calls, the order that they are received.
[01:55:42.845 --> 01:55:46.087]  So get ready and start your engines.
[01:55:46.087 --> 01:55:46.407]  In fact,
[01:55:47.403 --> 01:55:49.084]  Let's just go to the calls now.
[01:55:49.084 --> 01:55:52.307]  Dave in Pennsylvania, you're on the air.
[01:55:52.307 --> 01:55:53.808]  Yes, Alex, can you hear me?
[01:55:53.808 --> 01:55:55.329]  Yes, sir, go ahead.
[01:55:55.329 --> 01:55:55.849]  All right.
[01:55:55.849 --> 01:56:00.353]  We've got the bone broth just arrived at my door.
[01:56:00.353 --> 01:56:05.036]  See, I made one of the biggest mistakes I ever made, May of 21.
[01:56:05.036 --> 01:56:07.318]  I actually took the vaccine.
[01:56:07.318 --> 01:56:15.624]  I took one shot of the Johnson, and with not instantly, but within that year, I had four blood clots in my right calf.
[01:56:17.970 --> 01:56:21.113]  Fast forward, I got the blood results.
[01:56:21.113 --> 01:56:32.342]  The doctors said, oh, you have a genetic mutation that 1 in 50 people have that make you more likely to get a blood clot than someone else.
[01:56:32.342 --> 01:56:42.089]  So, number one, if 1 in 50 people have some kind of mutation making them more likely to get a blood clot, why would you give them a vaccine that would be more susceptible?
[01:56:42.089 --> 01:56:44.451]  George, thanks for making that up.
[01:56:44.451 --> 01:56:45.412]  Oh, I love the shot.
[01:56:45.412 --> 01:56:46.313]  I know everything's fine.
[01:56:47.338 --> 01:56:48.019]  Right, exactly.
[01:56:48.019 --> 01:56:51.562]  So, fast forward, yeah, I'm on a low-dose blood thinner.
[01:56:51.562 --> 01:56:57.026]  But ever since that, I didn't know about InfoWars at the time.
[01:56:57.026 --> 01:57:08.936]  I know about you guys now, and I'm in better health than I've ever been, because now that I'm awake to the vaccine stuff, when Trump said it was okay, I'm thinking, whatever.
[01:57:08.936 --> 01:57:10.838]  I was in the military for four years.
[01:57:11.286 --> 01:57:13.368]  God knows what they injected me with.
[01:57:13.368 --> 01:57:18.091]  I'm thinking, let me get this stupid card so I can travel and do whatever I need to do.
[01:57:18.091 --> 01:57:19.952]  And I got this card, the thing's not going to work.
[01:57:19.952 --> 01:57:20.993]  Hold on, don't hang up, Dane.
[01:57:20.993 --> 01:57:22.714]  I'm going to go to break for two minutes, come right back to you.
[01:57:22.714 --> 01:57:27.398]  I want you to tell your whole story here, and then we'll go to everybody else that you order that received.
[01:57:27.398 --> 01:57:32.421]  Richard, Justin, Carlos, Vincent, Alan, Dennis, Rob, Peter, your calls are straight ahead.
[01:57:32.421 --> 01:57:33.482]  Hour number three.
[01:57:33.482 --> 01:57:40.007]  And again, we got 14 minutes and ads an hour, unlike other podcasts, because we're still on a bunch of radio stations.
[01:57:40.814 --> 01:57:50.444]  But I've started a new commercial-free podcast at AlexJonesLive.com.
[01:57:50.444 --> 01:57:53.567]  I talk a lot about the great successes InfoWars has had.
[01:57:53.567 --> 01:57:55.889]  I don't think anybody can deny it.
[01:57:55.889 --> 01:57:59.833]  And it is because of listeners and viewers supporting us.
[01:57:59.833 --> 01:58:03.757]  When we talk about the crew at InfoWars, people behind the scenes, the researchers, the writers,
[01:58:05.191 --> 01:58:08.733]  They really have been the MVPs in this fight.
[01:58:08.733 --> 01:58:15.616]  And we look at Harrison Smith and Owen Schroer and the hard work they engage in every day, five, six, seven days a week.
[01:58:15.616 --> 01:58:16.517]  It's really just incredible.
[01:58:17.549 --> 01:58:20.430]  So for myself and the whole InfoWars crew, I thank you for your past support.
[01:58:20.430 --> 01:58:26.974]  I only encourage you now to realize that InfoWars cannot stay on air if you do not support us.
[01:58:26.974 --> 01:58:30.015]  I know you spread the word, I know you pray for us, and that's wonderful, keep doing it.
[01:58:30.015 --> 01:58:38.939]  But most viewers and listeners never go to InfoWarsStore.com, and you never buy great products that enrich and empower your life, while at the same time keep us on air.
[01:58:38.939 --> 01:58:42.521]  I know that less than 1% of our listeners actually go buy products at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:58:43.261 --> 01:58:48.184]  If just 1% more of you took action and went to InfoWars4.com, our funding problems will be over.
[01:58:48.184 --> 01:58:49.324]  Please take action now.
[01:58:49.324 --> 01:58:55.728]  I have an extremely important message to all of my fellow InfoWarriors here in the United States and around the world.
[01:58:55.728 --> 01:58:59.370]  We are so excited to announce InfoWars MD.
[01:59:00.350 --> 01:59:03.132]  It turns out the top company in the U.S.
[01:59:03.132 --> 01:59:05.374]  for supplements is owned by a Patreon.
[01:59:05.374 --> 01:59:12.138]  And it turns out they're willing to give us deals that no one else is getting because they want to support InfoWars and keep us on the air.
[01:59:12.138 --> 01:59:15.521]  This deal has been a year in the making and finally the products are being brought to market.
[01:59:16.141 --> 01:59:26.830]  Up to 50% off what you get on top national brands that are the highest rated under the Info Wars label, Info Wars MD, exclusively at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:59:26.830 --> 01:59:32.075]  Check out the first of 10 new products at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:59:32.075 --> 01:59:35.898]  Whether it's turmeric, or whether it's joint care, or whether it is super greens,
[01:59:36.318 --> 01:59:44.181]  We have them all at InfoWarsStore.com under the banner of InfoWarsMD.
[01:59:44.181 --> 01:59:47.722]  This is the best deal out there and it keeps InfoWars on the air.
[01:59:47.722 --> 01:59:52.463]  InfoWarsMD.
[01:59:52.463 --> 01:59:56.385]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:00:06.868 --> 02:00:18.095]  That's because you're asking the wrong people.
[02:00:18.095 --> 02:00:19.936]  Dave in Pennsylvania.
[02:00:19.936 --> 02:00:21.357]  Start your story over and describe.
[02:00:21.357 --> 02:00:24.419]  You took the Johnson & Johnson, which they now admit is linked to blood clots.
[02:00:24.419 --> 02:00:25.900]  They do it the whole time.
[02:00:25.900 --> 02:00:26.720]  And then what happened to you?
[02:00:26.720 --> 02:00:28.141]  Please continue.
[02:00:28.141 --> 02:00:28.781]  Right.
[02:00:28.781 --> 02:00:30.843]  I had no idea that the shots were dangerous.
[02:00:30.843 --> 02:00:32.844]  I didn't know about Infowars at the time.
[02:00:33.251 --> 02:00:39.452]  I got the shot and within, not instantly, but within that year, I had a soreness in my right calf.
[02:00:39.452 --> 02:00:40.633]  Just a regular soreness.
[02:00:40.633 --> 02:00:45.313]  I'm thinking maybe it's from running, maybe it's going too hard in the gym or whatever.
[02:00:45.313 --> 02:00:53.915]  But because then I started listening to InfoWars and I said, I'm getting this checked out to make sure it's nothing serious because I got this stupid shot.
[02:00:53.915 --> 02:00:57.136]  So sure enough, I go to the ER, they do an ultrasound.
[02:00:57.136 --> 02:01:01.017]  They told me I had four blood clots in my right calf.
[02:01:01.017 --> 02:01:02.057]  I'm a healthy guy.
[02:01:02.057 --> 02:01:02.917]  I exercise.
[02:01:03.604 --> 02:01:05.725]  I was in the Marines for four years.
[02:01:05.725 --> 02:01:09.668]  Um, there's no, there's no explanation of why I would have gotten the clock.
[02:01:09.668 --> 02:01:13.030]  So fast forward with blessing in the skies.
[02:01:13.030 --> 02:01:16.112]  Now that I know it's there, I look at it as a battle wound.
[02:01:16.681 --> 02:01:21.944]  Because right now we're in that war of information where they're lying to us constantly.
[02:01:21.944 --> 02:01:23.845]  They took a shot at me.
[02:01:23.845 --> 02:01:24.946]  Yeah, I got hit.
[02:01:24.946 --> 02:01:25.726]  But guess what?
[02:01:25.726 --> 02:01:30.409]  Now I'm fired up even more because luckily it didn't take me down.
[02:01:30.409 --> 02:01:31.610]  Beautiful.
[02:01:31.610 --> 02:01:32.050]  Keep going.
[02:01:32.050 --> 02:01:33.311]  But exactly.
[02:01:33.311 --> 02:01:34.532]  Don't be a victim.
[02:01:34.532 --> 02:01:36.853]  That which doesn't kill you makes you stronger.
[02:01:36.853 --> 02:01:38.074]  Now you know.
[02:01:38.074 --> 02:01:39.054]  Now it's a battle wound.
[02:01:39.054 --> 02:01:41.856]  Now you can get even healthier and warn others.
[02:01:41.856 --> 02:01:42.576]  Exactly.
[02:01:42.576 --> 02:01:43.697]  So now I'm fired up.
[02:01:44.062 --> 02:01:45.762]  Like, I'm healthier than ever.
[02:01:45.762 --> 02:01:47.063]  I'm exercising.
[02:01:47.063 --> 02:01:53.424]  I'm doing what I need to do to make sure that my cardiovascular is in the best shape that it's ever been.
[02:01:53.424 --> 02:01:53.964]  I'm 41.
[02:01:53.964 --> 02:01:55.984]  So, whatever.
[02:01:55.984 --> 02:01:56.744]  But I feel like I'm 22.
[02:01:56.744 --> 02:01:58.725]  Beautiful.
[02:01:58.725 --> 02:02:00.405]  But now, with the thing with Trump.
[02:02:00.405 --> 02:02:07.046]  Now, part of me is thinking, I have an idea why Trump isn't going back on the vaccine.
[02:02:07.046 --> 02:02:12.687]  Because at the time, we know he was being fed false information, listening to the doctors or whatever.
[02:02:13.462 --> 02:02:21.469]  But he was making deals with the FDA and Big Pharma to get it out quicker than it should have gone.
[02:02:21.469 --> 02:02:29.977]  So he had the right intentions, but he knows that part of his doing was speeding up the process, cutting to the real deal.
[02:02:29.977 --> 02:02:30.577]  Oh, totally.
[02:02:30.577 --> 02:02:31.839]  He knows he got set up.
[02:02:31.839 --> 02:02:35.282]  Because he was also trying to get all the therapeutics out there and they tried to block that.
[02:02:35.282 --> 02:02:37.824]  So he just believed in medicine and said anything.
[02:02:37.824 --> 02:02:39.826]  He just crutches the system and now he won't admit he was wrong.
[02:02:40.660 --> 02:02:46.824]  So now if he admits he's wrong, they're going to take that to him and say, oh, look at how corrupt you were.
[02:02:46.824 --> 02:02:53.148]  You paid off Big Pharma or you cut through the red tape with the FDA so you can get this shot out.
[02:02:53.148 --> 02:02:55.190]  It's all your fault, your fault.
[02:02:55.190 --> 02:02:58.852]  So he'll never go back on it because it's a double-edged sword.
[02:02:58.852 --> 02:03:00.193]  But he knows.
[02:03:00.193 --> 02:03:01.874]  And he knows it was a mistake.
[02:03:01.874 --> 02:03:05.076]  But I think it's too risky for him to admit it.
[02:03:05.076 --> 02:03:06.938]  But he knows what he did.
[02:03:06.938 --> 02:03:10.400]  And I still think his intentions were in the right place.
[02:03:11.971 --> 02:03:13.191]  Well, that's what I think has happened.
[02:03:13.191 --> 02:03:19.053]  But, you know, regardless, we know that they're planning even more attacks, more control.
[02:03:19.053 --> 02:03:25.696]  What do you think, Gabe, in closing, if the deep state's in so much trouble, which I think we all agree that people are waking up to them, they're not going to give up.
[02:03:25.696 --> 02:03:27.136]  What are they going to do next?
[02:03:27.136 --> 02:03:27.596]  Next move?
[02:03:27.596 --> 02:03:29.357]  They're going to cut off the food supply.
[02:03:29.878 --> 02:03:34.224]  They're going to use the weather, which they manipulate out there in the Midwest.
[02:03:34.224 --> 02:03:44.837]  They're going to cause some dramatic weather events, say, to cut off the food supply in combination with the EMP or something to take down the internet grid.
[02:03:44.837 --> 02:03:46.560]  And then when you can't eat,
[02:03:47.065 --> 02:03:50.126]  They're going to force you to follow what they need you to follow.
[02:03:50.126 --> 02:03:51.166]  I totally agree with you.
[02:03:51.166 --> 02:03:56.708]  So people need to know, what we've already been through is just the first leading edge of this attack.
[02:03:56.708 --> 02:04:00.110]  And I don't say that to scare people, but you can see it's a serious time, folks.
[02:04:00.110 --> 02:04:02.491]  Get ready, get prepared, however you think best.
[02:04:02.491 --> 02:04:04.531]  Thank you so much for the call, Dave.
[02:04:04.531 --> 02:04:05.972]  We're going to go to break.
[02:04:05.972 --> 02:04:08.213]  Come back in 60 seconds, join some stations.
[02:04:08.213 --> 02:04:12.314]  We're going to go to Rod in Kentucky.
[02:04:12.314 --> 02:04:14.535]  Then we're going to go to Justin in Florida.
[02:04:16.130 --> 02:04:17.011]  Carlos hung up.
[02:04:17.011 --> 02:04:19.352]  Sorry Carlos, I didn't get to you meant to.
[02:04:19.352 --> 02:04:21.573]  We're going to get to Vincent.
[02:04:21.573 --> 02:04:24.275]  I'm going to bam, bam, bam, go to your phone calls.
[02:04:24.275 --> 02:04:29.178]  The problem with the phone system with 20 plus lines is you get right on, but then it takes a while to get to you.
[02:04:29.178 --> 02:04:32.860]  We're doing the best job we can, but these callers are amazing as well.
[02:04:32.860 --> 02:04:36.142]  So I'm trying to give some of the callers as much time as possible.
[02:04:36.142 --> 02:04:39.805]  Back in 60 seconds and no matter how good your calls are,
[02:04:41.223 --> 02:04:42.684]  I'm going to 5 calls in the next segment.
[02:04:42.684 --> 02:04:45.405]  That means in 10 minutes, you each get about a minute 45.
[02:04:45.405 --> 02:04:47.467]  I've got to introduce you and go out.
[02:04:47.467 --> 02:04:51.809]  When we come back, Rod in Kentucky, be ready.
[02:04:51.809 --> 02:04:52.810]  I'm going right to you.
[02:04:52.810 --> 02:04:53.330]  Make your point.
[02:04:53.330 --> 02:04:54.271]  We're on the next person.
[02:04:54.271 --> 02:04:59.313]  Stay with us.
[02:04:59.313 --> 02:05:02.275]  Well, I just want to say about diet sports.
[02:05:02.275 --> 02:05:04.096]  Diet sports is amazing.
[02:05:04.096 --> 02:05:06.357]  I'm 45 and I have bits.
[02:05:06.357 --> 02:05:08.839]  I go to the gym and I have bits that won't move.
[02:05:09.691 --> 02:05:13.837]  And diet force has helped me move those bits.
[02:05:13.837 --> 02:05:18.624]  Under my pecs, my belly, I'm just taking diet force two tablets a day.
[02:05:18.624 --> 02:05:20.847]  Man, if you're like struggling to get
[02:05:22.026 --> 02:05:24.288]  Like, chip shake for the ladies.
[02:05:24.288 --> 02:05:27.010]  Mate, DietForce is the go.
[02:05:27.010 --> 02:05:29.933]  You have to get the DietForce and have to a day.
[02:05:29.933 --> 02:05:31.694]  And just keep at it.

[02:06:05.738 --> 02:06:16.162]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[02:06:16.162 --> 02:06:22.964]  We are now into hour number three, taking your phone calls on the nature of the universe and reality, and what's coming next.
[02:06:22.964 --> 02:06:26.565]  Rod in Kentucky, thanks for calling, you're on the air.
[02:06:26.565 --> 02:06:27.726]  Alex, this is Rod Butler.
[02:06:27.726 --> 02:06:28.706]  How are you doing?
[02:06:28.706 --> 02:06:30.307]  Good, brother, go ahead.
[02:06:30.307 --> 02:06:30.787]  Hey, listen.
[02:06:32.168 --> 02:06:34.369]  I'm a nervous wreck now, this is the first time caller.
[02:06:34.369 --> 02:06:42.093]  I just want to tell you that I use all your products and I've been listening to you since the AOL days in the mid-90s, early 90s.
[02:06:42.093 --> 02:06:50.378]  And man, you have, it's been hard to be a fan of yours because everybody has always thought I was crazy, but buddy, you are spot on.
[02:06:50.378 --> 02:06:54.160]  And I want to thank you for waking me up and waking all the people around me up.
[02:06:54.160 --> 02:06:55.941]  Hey, we've all been waking each other up, brother.
[02:06:55.941 --> 02:06:58.982]  It's good to have you after all these years to talk to you.
[02:06:58.982 --> 02:07:00.083]  What do you think is coming next?
[02:07:01.707 --> 02:07:02.068]  I don't know.
[02:07:02.068 --> 02:07:03.008]  I agree with the last caller.
[02:07:03.008 --> 02:07:07.931]  I think they're going to try to do something to our food, and they're definitely trying to shut down our power.
[02:07:07.931 --> 02:07:11.173]  They don't want us to have electricity or food.
[02:07:11.173 --> 02:07:15.815]  And this leadership we have, they all look like cartoon characters.
[02:07:15.815 --> 02:07:22.999]  They look like the Looney Tunes parade when they come down the aisle at the thing last night, you know?
[02:07:22.999 --> 02:07:24.841]  They're trying to smother us out, man.
[02:07:24.841 --> 02:07:30.764]  They want to have only insane people in power, and they want insane people that will follow their orders.
[02:07:32.372 --> 02:07:36.575]  Humanity is being maneuvered into Armageddon, I totally agree.
[02:07:36.575 --> 02:07:37.316]  How do we stop it?
[02:07:37.316 --> 02:07:39.217]  Yes, sir.
[02:07:39.217 --> 02:07:45.061]  We've got to wake more people up, and people have got to get up off of their butt and take some kind of action.
[02:07:45.061 --> 02:07:46.542]  I don't know what that is.
[02:07:46.542 --> 02:07:49.084]  We need leaders who will help us do that.
[02:07:49.084 --> 02:07:55.088]  Well, the biggest thing is pull our children out of the public schools, disengage from the system as much as we can, and just warn everybody.
[02:07:55.088 --> 02:07:55.808]  Thank you for the call.
[02:07:55.808 --> 02:07:56.969]  Great call.
[02:07:56.969 --> 02:07:58.610]  Let's talk to Justin in Florida.
[02:07:58.610 --> 02:07:59.131]  Go ahead, Justin.
[02:08:01.380 --> 02:08:04.262]  Hey Alex, I'll get right to it.
[02:08:04.262 --> 02:08:13.146]  What I've been thinking about when I've been thinking about trumping the vaccine, and I think to myself, what's more deadly, the shot, or the virus, or the lockdowns?
[02:08:13.146 --> 02:08:17.969]  And clearly the lockdowns, to me, was the most deadly aspect of this whole ordeal.
[02:08:17.969 --> 02:08:24.272]  And the globalists said they needed the vaccine to stop the lockdowns.
[02:08:24.272 --> 02:08:29.695]  Operation Warp Speed, to me, was more about getting therapeutics out there, hydroxychloroquine, I haven't mentioned,
[02:08:31.678 --> 02:08:34.260]  Which would have actually thwarted the vaccine issue.
[02:08:34.260 --> 02:08:41.426]  And with Trump, there has been some signal, and not the noise.
[02:08:41.426 --> 02:08:50.612]  There was a show or a rally he did, and Trump said, leave the kids alone, and he made a symbol to their heart.
[02:08:50.612 --> 02:08:58.458]  And he said also on the water cooler with David Brody, he is concerned about potential vaccine injuries.
[02:08:59.063 --> 02:09:10.019]  Um, and he said, uh, you know, and at one point, I think, you know, and on the David O'Reilly show, he said, you know, he talked about people criticizing him and the vaccines.
[02:09:10.019 --> 02:09:11.922]  He sort of said, you're not helping our cause.
[02:09:12.566 --> 02:09:23.933]  And I think this aspect of it, that the vaccines thwarted the lockdowns, and if we hadn't had the lockdowns, you know, if we hadn't had the vaccine to thwart the lockdowns, then you would be, it would be over by now.
[02:09:23.933 --> 02:09:34.019]  You would have total chaos in the streets, and, you know... Well, there's no doubt they're going to try to have the lockdowns go forever, like two years of Third World, only six months here, but...
[02:09:34.719 --> 02:09:38.680]  I get how they set him up, but it doesn't mean the vaccine saved us from that.
[02:09:38.680 --> 02:09:42.721]  They said, oh sir, sign this warp speed, we can get it done quicker and unlock things.
[02:09:42.721 --> 02:09:46.421]  So he bought into it, and then now he won him and he's wrong.
[02:09:46.421 --> 02:09:54.003]  Right, well there's some aspects of that that, you know, well even, you know, Trump's not the one giving it to six-year-olds and pregnant women, and we're the only country in the world where he has it.
[02:09:54.003 --> 02:09:56.123]  No, no, I hear you, he's come out against that and that's good.
[02:09:56.123 --> 02:09:57.283]  Great call, appreciate your call.
[02:09:57.283 --> 02:09:59.544]  We're gonna get five calls in this segment.
[02:09:59.544 --> 02:10:01.304]  Vincent in Canada, go ahead, thanks for calling.
[02:10:02.646 --> 02:10:04.367]  Oh, good to talk to you, Alex.
[02:10:04.367 --> 02:10:10.070]  Listen, I was wondering if you've ever given thought to klepto-parasitism.
[02:10:10.070 --> 02:10:12.652]  Klepto-parasitism?
[02:10:12.652 --> 02:10:14.033]  Yeah, klepto-parasite.
[02:10:14.033 --> 02:10:15.934]  It's a clinical term for cuckoos.
[02:10:15.934 --> 02:10:20.376]  And you find cuckoo birds, cuckoo bees, cuckoo wasps.
[02:10:20.376 --> 02:10:27.600]  And when the Hunger Games came out back in the noughties, I just thought, wow, the ruling class, there's really something wrong with it.
[02:10:27.600 --> 02:10:28.901]  So maybe, like you,
[02:10:29.457 --> 02:10:43.401]  Well, the globalists say they want to be their own species, and I guess you could say sociopaths and psychopaths are kind of their own group of humans, but I know about cuckoo birds and things, but I'll have to look this up.
[02:10:43.401 --> 02:10:45.122]  What is a cuckoo bee?
[02:11:00.345 --> 02:11:02.166]  Yeah, it's fascinating.
[02:11:02.166 --> 02:11:09.051]  Back in the 90s when cable television came, when the advent of cable television happened, there was a channel called the Learning Channel.
[02:11:09.051 --> 02:11:21.819]  Sorry, I'm not fairly familiar with television, but there was a documentary about the European honeybee and its cuckoo bee.
[02:11:21.819 --> 02:11:23.420]  Guys, look up cuckoo bee.
[02:11:23.420 --> 02:11:24.381]  So is it a false bee?
[02:11:25.572 --> 02:11:27.512]  No, it's nature.
[02:11:27.512 --> 02:11:37.794]  It's a form of, they steal the host offspring, the eggs, or the larvae, the grub, and then they lay their own, they deposit their own eggs, so they steal.
[02:11:37.794 --> 02:11:40.655]  Oh yeah, they have like, the cow bird does that.
[02:11:40.655 --> 02:11:42.915]  Okay, well I think I've read about that.
[02:11:42.915 --> 02:11:43.595]  I'll look into that.
[02:11:43.595 --> 02:11:44.716]  Thank you so much.
[02:11:44.716 --> 02:11:46.056]  Wow, these calls are cool.
[02:11:46.056 --> 02:11:47.416]  Let's talk to Alan in Oregon.
[02:11:47.416 --> 02:11:48.256]  You're on the air, go ahead.
[02:11:48.256 --> 02:11:51.817]  Hello sir, nice to speak with you, Alex.
[02:11:51.817 --> 02:11:52.477]  Nice to talk to you.
[02:11:53.584 --> 02:11:55.305]  I just wanted to thank you, sir.
[02:11:55.305 --> 02:12:04.929]  I found you back in 07 after googling fluoride effects because doctors are trying to give my son, my newborn son, fluoride drops in his medicine.
[02:12:04.929 --> 02:12:07.170]  Or not even his medicine, it was a vitamin drop.
[02:12:07.170 --> 02:12:13.772]  And they admit no child needs any fluoride until age 5, even if it's pure calcium fluoride.
[02:12:13.772 --> 02:12:18.054]  They were trying to give them, at the store it says fluoride water for babies.
[02:12:18.054 --> 02:12:18.855]  It's total evil.
[02:12:18.855 --> 02:12:19.375]  Lowers their IQ.
[02:12:20.762 --> 02:12:34.290]  It was terrible, and I even said to the doctor, I said, you know, I know that fluoride's bad, and that it says on the toothpaste thing not to swallow fluoride, and she says, oh no, it's fine, this is a different fluoride, it's good for his teeth, and I was like, he doesn't even have teeth!
[02:12:34.290 --> 02:12:34.990]  What are we doing here?
[02:12:34.990 --> 02:12:41.934]  So I went home, Googled and searched this, I found some videos of you, I've been listening ever since, so thank you.
[02:12:41.934 --> 02:12:49.118]  I've got a, I purchased your HDH Max Boost, and that stuff's really changed my life, just in the matter of my sleeping.
[02:12:50.004 --> 02:12:52.346]  I'm wondering when you guys are going to get that back.
[02:12:52.346 --> 02:12:57.689]  But I used to sweat crazily at night, every single night, just waking up drenched.
[02:12:57.689 --> 02:12:59.710]  I went to the doctor, they said, hey, what's going on?
[02:12:59.710 --> 02:13:01.832]  They said, oh, it's normal with some guys.
[02:13:01.832 --> 02:13:06.374]  I thought, maybe this has to be hormone-related, and so I started taking that stuff two months ago.
[02:13:06.374 --> 02:13:08.936]  And I can sleep, like, that's the other thing.
[02:13:08.936 --> 02:13:10.077]  I can sleep so well.
[02:13:10.077 --> 02:13:13.559]  I normally sleep four hours, five hours a night.
[02:13:13.559 --> 02:13:17.001]  Well, we've only got a limited supply, and we're hoping to get more in very, very soon.
[02:13:19.304 --> 02:13:21.506]  I mean, I appreciate your point on that.
[02:13:21.506 --> 02:13:23.628]  Anything else, Alan, on Elon Musk?
[02:13:23.628 --> 02:13:26.550]  Yeah, last thing was on Elon Musk.
[02:13:26.550 --> 02:13:36.077]  I keep thinking back to, you know, the Spars document, the pandemic, the 2025-2028 document is really what we're living in now.
[02:13:36.077 --> 02:13:39.580]  And I think back to the EpiGirl.
[02:13:39.580 --> 02:13:45.725]  And I'm wondering, you know, is Elon Musk sparking this to get people to discredit the government?
[02:13:45.725 --> 02:13:47.326]  Is he this catalyst for this?
[02:13:48.171 --> 02:13:52.593]  For this, you know, for that type of event or what have you.
[02:13:52.593 --> 02:13:57.055]  Is he trying to get people to buy into corporations instead of the government?
[02:13:57.055 --> 02:13:57.975]  That's kind of my theory.
[02:13:57.975 --> 02:14:03.817]  Well, that's what the globalists do is they control the government with their money and then they blame the government for what they've done.
[02:14:03.817 --> 02:14:08.379]  I'm going to blame the government all day, but they're like the capo under the don or the mob boss.
[02:14:08.379 --> 02:14:13.301]  So the government's the capo, but the mob boss is the corporation.
[02:14:13.301 --> 02:14:15.122]  I mean, I think he sees the world waking up.
[02:14:16.102 --> 02:14:19.523]  And I think he wants to basically play both sides.
[02:14:19.523 --> 02:14:20.024]  Sure.
[02:14:20.024 --> 02:14:21.084]  Okay.
[02:14:21.084 --> 02:14:21.924]  Very good.
[02:14:21.924 --> 02:14:23.265]  Thanks for the call, Allen.
[02:14:23.265 --> 02:14:24.285]  Dennis in Kentucky.
[02:14:24.285 --> 02:14:26.626]  Go ahead.
[02:14:26.626 --> 02:14:28.907]  How you doing, Alex?
[02:14:28.907 --> 02:14:29.487]  I'm good, Dennis.
[02:14:29.487 --> 02:14:31.307]  Go ahead.
[02:14:31.307 --> 02:14:32.828]  M4WarStore.com.
[02:14:32.828 --> 02:14:35.389]  Thank you for being always the voice of the people.
[02:14:36.492 --> 02:14:40.977]  Also, happy Naive People Month.
[02:14:40.977 --> 02:14:42.938]  Biden is what Biden is.
[02:14:42.938 --> 02:14:45.000]  This man's been sliding off.
[02:14:45.000 --> 02:14:53.488]  But when I logged in today, I've seen the headline, you know, as soon as I got on here on and it said the FBI needs another 9-11.
[02:14:53.488 --> 02:14:56.271]  Well, I think that that 9-11 would be a cruise ship.
[02:14:57.370 --> 02:14:59.232]  In the summertime, it's going to pop.
[02:14:59.232 --> 02:14:59.813]  Hold on, Dennis.
[02:14:59.813 --> 02:15:00.374]  Don't hang up.
[02:15:00.374 --> 02:15:01.755]  I don't want to cut you off.
[02:15:01.755 --> 02:15:03.377]  Hold, please, sir.
[02:15:03.377 --> 02:15:04.339]  We'll go to break for a few minutes.
[02:15:04.339 --> 02:15:06.081]  Come right back with Dennis.
[02:15:06.081 --> 02:15:10.486]  And then we're going to go to Richard.
[02:15:10.486 --> 02:15:16.093]  And we're going to go to everybody else, especially holding the order your calls received, like Peter.
[02:15:17.529 --> 02:15:17.849]  We're good.
[02:15:28.243 --> 02:15:30.764]  I mean, guessing the enemy's plan isn't hard.
[02:15:30.764 --> 02:15:34.226]  We know they're going to blow something up or do something big and be the savior.
[02:15:34.226 --> 02:15:36.227]  The question is, what is it going to be?
[02:15:36.227 --> 02:15:39.188]  And so we're going to get Dennis' take on that when we come back.
[02:15:39.188 --> 02:15:41.569]  Please don't forget, I just want to wake people up.
[02:15:41.569 --> 02:15:44.651]  Hundreds and hundreds of banned people are at Banned.Video.
[02:15:44.651 --> 02:15:46.592]  Hundreds of contributors, Banned.Video.
[02:15:46.592 --> 02:15:47.492]  Please share those links.
[02:15:47.492 --> 02:15:48.713]  A lot of great videos.
[02:15:48.713 --> 02:15:49.473]  Banned.Video.
[02:15:49.473 --> 02:15:50.574]  It's so important.
[02:15:50.574 --> 02:15:52.434]  The public's ready to hear the truth right now.
[02:15:52.434 --> 02:15:53.835]  We've got to bring the truth to them.
[02:15:53.835 --> 02:15:54.755]  Banned.Video.
[02:15:54.755 --> 02:15:55.536]  Please take action now.
[02:15:57.697 --> 02:16:00.918]  Infowars MD is finally here.
[02:16:00.918 --> 02:16:17.603]  It's the very same high quality products you've been getting through Infowars Life, but an expanded catalog and in some cases the prices are lower because we're going directly to the source that was supplying the supplement companies that we were buying our high quality products from.
[02:16:17.603 --> 02:16:23.505]  So we're able to lower prices and bring you more products via the Infowars MD line.
[02:16:24.065 --> 02:16:26.626]  The highest quality, triple tested.
[02:16:26.626 --> 02:16:30.567]  Many of these products are sold on store shelves for more than twice the cost.
[02:16:30.567 --> 02:16:35.068]  You'll get them at InfoWarsStore.com under our exclusive label.

[02:16:46.851 --> 02:16:52.332]  So again, introducing InfoWars MD, now exclusively available at InfoWarsStore.com with
[02:16:52.592 --> 02:16:57.795]  Massive, massive savings.
[02:16:57.795 --> 02:17:03.979]  Everyone watching should realize that this is an information war and it takes money to fund an information war.
[02:17:03.979 --> 02:17:16.967]  And everyone should decide to take the fight to the next level and to take the fight to the very tip of the spear and ensure we stay in the field in this war against the new world order by visiting InfoWarstore.com right now and taking action.
[02:17:16.967 --> 02:17:21.910]  I thank you for your vast support and I ask you now to count the cost and realize that only your commitment
[02:17:22.150 --> 02:17:26.253]  To keep Info Wars on the air, we'll ensure our victory against the New World Order.
[02:17:26.253 --> 02:17:27.734]  They're coming for you and your family.
[02:17:27.734 --> 02:17:28.975]  They're coming for me.
[02:17:28.975 --> 02:17:30.216]  They're coming for the children.
[02:17:30.216 --> 02:17:32.798]  But to get to the children, they've got to get through us first.
[02:17:32.798 --> 02:17:36.201]  These monsters are all over television, wanting to give these shots to newborn babies.
[02:17:36.201 --> 02:17:37.722]  They're already giving them to pregnant women.
[02:17:37.722 --> 02:17:39.824]  Miscarriages are off the chart.
[02:17:39.824 --> 02:17:44.828]  80 plus percent increase in miscarriages in the first two trimesters after these poison shots.
[02:17:45.228 --> 02:17:49.153]  We can and will save the children, and they are counting on us.
[02:17:49.153 --> 02:17:50.355]  Let's do it together.
[02:17:50.355 --> 02:17:52.657]  And the fight starts at InfoWars.com.
[02:17:52.657 --> 02:17:56.462]  And the fight continues with your financial support at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:17:56.462 --> 02:17:57.624]  Now take action now!
[02:17:57.624 --> 02:18:01.148]  The most banned man in America, Alex Jones!
[02:18:05.908 --> 02:18:07.248]  I want you all to know something.
[02:18:07.248 --> 02:18:09.209]  Alex Jones was right.
[02:18:09.209 --> 02:18:12.730]  Alex is right about far more than is wrong.
[02:18:12.730 --> 02:18:15.670]  Alex has been right on for over a decade.
[02:18:15.670 --> 02:18:20.112]  I don't care how you slice it, dice it, flip it up or rub it down.
[02:18:20.112 --> 02:18:22.312]  Alex Jones was right.
[02:18:22.312 --> 02:18:25.853]  Think about how frustrated we are if you've been awake for a year or two.
[02:18:25.853 --> 02:18:29.314]  Imagine being like an Alex Jones or those guys who've been awake for like decades.
[02:18:29.574 --> 02:18:32.435]  Alex Jones called this years ago.
[02:18:32.435 --> 02:18:33.475]  Years ago.
[02:18:33.475 --> 02:18:35.555]  Alex Jones never bought the Russia hoax.
[02:18:35.555 --> 02:18:37.536]  Not for a second.
[02:18:37.536 --> 02:18:40.056]  You are one of the great thinkers of this.
[02:18:40.056 --> 02:18:42.537]  You are a martyr to the First Amendment.
[02:18:42.537 --> 02:18:45.637]  The government fears Alex Jones.
[02:18:45.637 --> 02:18:47.198]  That's why the globalists hate me.
[02:18:47.198 --> 02:18:52.939]  It's because I'm exposing their corporate worldwide tyranny.
[02:18:52.939 --> 02:18:54.199]  AlexJonesLive.com
[02:18:57.921 --> 02:19:03.668]  If you go to OnlineHealthNow.com, connect with trusted and unbiased doctors at the wellness company.
[02:19:03.668 --> 02:19:07.532]  And I tell you, I'm honored to be the Chief Scientific Officer of the company.
[02:19:07.532 --> 02:19:12.077]  I contribute like so many else do there, so many wonderful doctors.
[02:19:12.077 --> 02:19:17.704]  Far and away the most popular product is Dr. Vandewater's detoxification supplement.
[02:19:17.944 --> 02:19:19.525]  That features natokinase.
[02:19:19.525 --> 02:19:21.866]  It's a natural proteolytic enzyme.
[02:19:21.866 --> 02:19:27.549]  This one is the only enzyme that we're aware of right now that dissolves the spike protein.
[02:19:27.549 --> 02:19:28.349]  This is very important.
[02:19:28.349 --> 02:19:33.392]  The spike protein is loaded in the body with the COVID-19 infection and definitely with the vaccines.
[02:19:33.392 --> 02:19:34.892]  People are low with the spike protein.
[02:19:34.892 --> 02:19:35.833]  They don't feel well.
[02:19:35.833 --> 02:19:37.554]  This is a potential solution.
[02:19:37.554 --> 02:19:40.615]  Hydroxychloroquine comes from a natural substance.
[02:19:40.615 --> 02:19:43.517]  So does ivermectin and now natokinase.
[02:19:43.517 --> 02:19:44.897]  Isn't it interesting?
[02:19:44.897 --> 02:19:45.998]  Natural substances
[02:19:46.078 --> 02:19:46.938]  Made you a coffee
[02:20:15.353 --> 02:20:16.735]  We're good to go.
[02:20:26.203 --> 02:20:28.784]  Watching the chemtrails
[02:20:53.091 --> 02:21:00.657]  Over the country club, a perfect metaphor for what we deny we're under attack, deny our environment's being changed, deny that we're being poisoned.
[02:21:00.657 --> 02:21:08.363]  We just sit here in the country club, there's the movies and the restaurants and the pool halls, and I'm not knocking any of that, I love movies and restaurants and pool halls.
[02:21:08.363 --> 02:21:13.587]  And football games and basketball games and track meets and all the fun stuff we all love and fishing and hunting.
[02:21:13.587 --> 02:21:17.831]  But while that's going on, the globalists are playing God, manipulating us all.
[02:21:18.749 --> 02:21:24.151]  Dennis, you were talking about what's coming next and the summer bubble gonna pop.
[02:21:24.151 --> 02:21:25.712]  You're talking about false flags.
[02:21:25.712 --> 02:21:28.353]  Tell us what you got for us.
[02:21:28.353 --> 02:21:29.673]  That's exactly what I believe.
[02:21:29.673 --> 02:21:39.537]  I mean, if that's truly, you know, how things is moving, they need something that's going to give that immediate knee jerk reaction, something to tug on the people's hearts.
[02:21:39.537 --> 02:21:45.139]  So with that being said, something of that nature that has a slew of people on a targeted ship.
[02:21:46.187 --> 02:21:52.052]  See, they can dock that ship and even claim COVID or anything, which later will come out.
[02:21:52.052 --> 02:21:55.514]  That shedding is going to be a problem.
[02:21:55.514 --> 02:21:57.396]  I mean, it's very simple to do.
[02:21:57.396 --> 02:22:04.862]  If you overlook at something of that magnitude, that's what's going to be able to keep them from keep doing it.
[02:22:04.862 --> 02:22:05.762]  No, I get what you're saying.
[02:22:05.762 --> 02:22:07.704]  They already hit us with a bio attack.
[02:22:07.704 --> 02:22:09.865]  Their whole posture is a bio attack.
[02:22:09.865 --> 02:22:12.127]  You're saying you think the next thing will be a bio attack.
[02:22:12.127 --> 02:22:12.848]  I think you're probably right.
[02:22:14.420 --> 02:22:18.141]  Yes, because in that mass setting of a cruise ship.
[02:22:18.141 --> 02:22:23.603]  Now, they're going to blame it on who they blame it on, but it's just the initial act of its own.
[02:22:23.603 --> 02:22:25.704]  That's what's going to pull it.
[02:22:25.704 --> 02:22:27.144]  And that's going to happen.
[02:22:27.144 --> 02:22:33.246]  Because all I'm saying now is ask for cruise ships.
[02:22:33.246 --> 02:22:35.087]  Sorry, sir.
[02:22:35.087 --> 02:22:36.127]  I think it's probable.
[02:22:36.127 --> 02:22:37.948]  I mean, there's no telling what they're going to do.
[02:22:37.948 --> 02:22:39.468]  Thank you so much, Dennis.
[02:22:39.468 --> 02:22:40.809]  Let's go to Carlos in Canada.
[02:22:40.809 --> 02:22:41.729]  Carlos, thanks for holding.
[02:22:41.729 --> 02:22:42.930]  Go ahead.
[02:22:42.930 --> 02:22:43.790]  Thank you very much, Alex.
[02:22:44.677 --> 02:22:57.847]  I've always thought this was a lot of distractions and a lot of smoke and mirrors, I used the term before, to distract from the real financial control that is being exercised.
[02:22:57.847 --> 02:23:03.492]  I believe that in the near future, there's going to be what is called a great reset.
[02:23:03.492 --> 02:23:08.516]  But you know, the word reset comes from the idea of resetting your computer.
[02:23:08.516 --> 02:23:10.477]  And when you reset your computer, what do you do?
[02:23:10.477 --> 02:23:11.438]  You turn the power off.
[02:23:12.185 --> 02:23:13.086]  And then what?
[02:23:13.086 --> 02:23:22.314]  You upload new information or new programs and then you reboot your programs into the reset, you see, into the new situation with the computer.
[02:23:22.314 --> 02:23:24.976]  I think that the idea of a
[02:23:25.746 --> 02:23:35.173]  Having a cyber attack where the electrical systems go down for a while have been talked about by several people in the World Economic Forum.
[02:23:35.173 --> 02:23:41.879]  Well, I was about to say, Klaus Schwab and them drool and say, a cyber attack will make COVID look like nothing.
[02:23:41.879 --> 02:23:46.182]  And all their PR people are saying, cyber attack, cyber attack.
[02:23:46.182 --> 02:23:46.542]  Right.
[02:23:46.542 --> 02:23:49.705]  But you know, when you buy a house, you get a title deed, right?
[02:23:49.705 --> 02:23:50.005]  Yes.
[02:23:50.005 --> 02:23:50.686]  You know.
[02:23:50.686 --> 02:23:51.126]  Okay.
[02:23:51.126 --> 02:23:54.328]  So how many people have a house that don't have a title deed?
[02:23:54.328 --> 02:23:54.849]  Think about it.
[02:23:55.245 --> 02:23:56.346]  A lot of people.
[02:23:56.346 --> 02:23:56.986]  No.
[02:23:56.986 --> 02:24:01.169]  Everybody has a title deed as a notary, and they pay welcome taxes or whatever it is.
[02:24:01.169 --> 02:24:03.450]  Here in Canada, everybody's got a title deed.
[02:24:03.450 --> 02:24:12.316]  When you buy a lot of money, you put into shares in the stock market, what do you get for it if you don't take the certificate and you deliver it to your home?
[02:24:12.316 --> 02:24:13.617]  You get what?
[02:24:13.617 --> 02:24:16.819]  The word of a stockbroker saying that, oh, we have your certificate.
[02:24:16.819 --> 02:24:18.280]  You said something really smart.
[02:24:18.280 --> 02:24:20.381]  Most of the time, it's not even in your name.
[02:24:20.381 --> 02:24:21.762]  They've already pledged it to another investment.
[02:24:24.740 --> 02:24:28.463]  And they vote, your vote, in that company direction.
[02:24:28.463 --> 02:24:30.224]  If you don't like what Walt Disney is doing, they don't care.
[02:24:30.224 --> 02:24:34.927]  But that's why with Blackrock, the majority of money is in Blackrock, they vote for you.
[02:24:34.927 --> 02:24:37.489]  Yeah, and they vote what they want, not for you.
[02:24:37.489 --> 02:24:38.950]  They vote what they want.
[02:24:38.950 --> 02:24:48.937]  And if you think that after a three day... No, you just said that the big fraud is, people that hold stock, the stock was always about power in the company, for the direction of the company, not just an investment.
[02:24:48.937 --> 02:24:52.159]  People that advocate the responsibility with stock.
[02:24:52.159 --> 02:24:52.960]  So how do we change that?
[02:24:54.005 --> 02:24:54.866]  Well, very simple.
[02:24:54.866 --> 02:25:07.736]  You simply say, hey, if there's a power failure, and I don't have a, if there's a disaster, for instance, an economic disaster, and you don't have a Title D to your home, how are you going to prove that it's your home?
[02:25:07.736 --> 02:25:09.958]  If they tell you there's, we don't know anymore.
[02:25:09.958 --> 02:25:10.298]  I agree.
[02:25:10.298 --> 02:25:13.020]  The cyber attacks meant to wipe out the old system.
[02:25:13.020 --> 02:25:15.742]  So many times on 9-11 they blew up the CIA building, Building 7.
[02:25:15.742 --> 02:25:18.204]  They had all the government documents in it.
[02:25:18.204 --> 02:25:22.468]  They will use these disasters to get rid of the deeds to absolutely steal your money.
[02:25:23.547 --> 02:25:24.067]  Exactly.
[02:25:24.067 --> 02:25:37.592]  And so, if you really want to slow the process down, if you really want to make your companies accountable to what you want, you don't want your children's minds polluted, don't let these guys vote at the board of directors, at their shares.
[02:25:37.592 --> 02:25:42.393]  Don't let them tell that they have $30 trillion on their management when they don't.
[02:25:42.393 --> 02:25:49.876]  They have management of shares of people that have worked very hard to pay for those shares, they have them in brokers, and they vote whatever they want with it.
[02:25:49.876 --> 02:25:52.497]  So, the solution is, take the certificates
[02:25:52.917 --> 02:25:53.578]  I agree.
[02:25:53.578 --> 02:25:58.742]  How do we democratize shareholder votes?
[02:25:58.742 --> 02:26:01.845]  And protect yourself against the reset.
[02:26:01.845 --> 02:26:09.691]  Because if there is a financial clean-out and they don't have any records of your shares, like they didn't have your gold certificate.
[02:26:09.691 --> 02:26:20.621]  And by the way, what you're saying is key, because we have the FDIC here and other central bank insurance corporations saying that things are going down, there's about to be a bail-in, they're about to reset and take part of your account.
[02:26:21.479 --> 02:26:22.240]  You're absolutely right.
[02:26:22.240 --> 02:26:25.122]  Documenting what you actually have is key.
[02:26:25.122 --> 02:26:25.763]  It's key.
[02:26:25.763 --> 02:26:27.925]  And not only that, it hasn't happened yet.
[02:26:27.925 --> 02:26:35.811]  But when they go to influence governments, like they go to influence the Pope, they tell the Pope, hey, we have $20 trillion under management.
[02:26:35.811 --> 02:26:37.413]  We're big shots.
[02:26:37.413 --> 02:26:39.354]  You know, you say, wait a second.
[02:26:39.354 --> 02:26:41.056]  Deliver first, OK?
[02:26:41.056 --> 02:26:43.538]  Give us the administrative power.
[02:26:43.538 --> 02:26:44.459]  We're the shareholders.
[02:26:44.830 --> 02:26:45.851]  You're not the shareholder.
[02:26:45.851 --> 02:26:46.871]  We're the shareholders.
[02:26:46.871 --> 02:26:47.751]  These are administrators.
[02:26:47.751 --> 02:26:53.594]  Well, that's already happening with legislatures saying no, with state funds being invested with BlackRock and Vanguard.
[02:26:53.594 --> 02:27:03.259]  And there was companies that came out and helped shareholders vote on a digital proven platform where you could check your vote, know it's what the vote you made, and then see that algorithm.
[02:27:03.259 --> 02:27:05.160]  I don't know how else you would do it.
[02:27:05.160 --> 02:27:11.523]  Imagine the new future would be block voting by democratized shareholders at those shareholder meetings.
[02:27:12.344 --> 02:27:13.005]  Exactly.
[02:27:13.005 --> 02:27:24.478]  And you must ask your broker, thank you very much, you have my money, here's the stock, give me the certificate, it can be sold anytime, I just bring it in, you pay me, give me a check within seven days, five business days.
[02:27:24.478 --> 02:27:32.787]  So, in all fairness, okay, why don't you hold your shares in case there's a power failure and you can't get your shares approved, that you have
[02:27:33.087 --> 02:27:41.170]  And a microcosm of that is, holding a lot of your money in cash, the way the system works, while they want to get rid of cash, it gives you that little bit of a hedge.
[02:27:41.170 --> 02:27:45.571]  Once they get rid of the cash, can you imagine what it's going to be like, Carlos?
[02:27:45.571 --> 02:27:53.034]  Well, I imagine it, of course, because in the future, there's going to be a company that's going to be created called eBarter, just like eBay.
[02:27:53.413 --> 02:28:04.561]  Where you are going to be able to barter, and somebody likes your product, they're going to say, you have so many credits in your e-barter account or whatever, and then you just barter your services, your whatever.
[02:28:04.561 --> 02:28:05.782]  You're forward-looking.
[02:28:05.782 --> 02:28:13.087]  This is exactly, instead of groveling to the system and opposing it, which we should, building new systems is how we win.
[02:28:13.087 --> 02:28:17.770]  Doctor, listen, there was a gentleman, whose name I will mention to you in future calls,
[02:28:18.303 --> 02:28:23.325]  And he said to President Kennedy, President Kennedy, I've written a book about it.
[02:28:23.325 --> 02:28:24.546]  I've talked about it.
[02:28:24.546 --> 02:28:28.708]  People that are workers, they are entitled to own their company as well.
[02:28:28.708 --> 02:28:32.550]  It's not just a question of working to make people rich.
[02:28:32.550 --> 02:28:36.132]  It's a question of working so the condition of the human being is better.
[02:28:36.132 --> 02:28:38.953]  President Kennedy discussed this with President De Gaulle.
[02:28:39.477 --> 02:28:50.339]  Okay, and President in 1961, and President De Gaulle in 1969, trying to move through a referendum, the sharing of the wealth of the companies with the workers, okay?
[02:28:50.339 --> 02:28:52.319]  And that's real, that's real capitalism.
[02:28:52.319 --> 02:28:52.999]  All right.
[02:28:52.999 --> 02:28:53.679]  Thanks for the call.
[02:28:53.679 --> 02:28:54.760]  More calls straight ahead.
[02:28:54.760 --> 02:28:55.620]  Stay with us.
[02:28:55.620 --> 02:28:58.720]  Thank you.
[02:28:58.720 --> 02:29:01.661]  Well, I just want to say about diet force.
[02:29:01.661 --> 02:29:03.761]  Diet force is amazing.
[02:29:03.761 --> 02:29:08.242]  I'm 45, and I have bits, I go to the gym, and I have bits that won't move.
[02:29:09.093 --> 02:29:11.675]  And diet force has helped me move those bits.
[02:29:11.675 --> 02:29:18.041]  Like, under my pecs, my belly, I'm just taking diet force two tablets a day.
[02:29:18.041 --> 02:29:20.243]  Man, if you're like struggling to get
[02:29:21.425 --> 02:29:24.266]  Like, chip shake for the ladies, mate.
[02:29:24.266 --> 02:29:26.426]  DietForce is the go.
[02:29:26.426 --> 02:29:29.327]  You have to get the DietForce and have two a day.
[02:29:29.327 --> 02:29:31.087]  And just keep at it.
[02:29:31.087 --> 02:29:32.588]  InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:29:32.588 --> 02:29:33.468]  X7 DietForce.

[02:29:40.450 --> 02:29:41.290]  I can guarantee you that.
[02:29:41.290 --> 02:29:43.311]  Thank you so much for the call, Grant.
[02:29:43.311 --> 02:29:44.831]  God bless Australia.

[02:29:58.504 --> 02:30:11.012]  In the year 2000, Alex Jones' film Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove showed the world how our so-called elite leaders practice mock ritual sacrifices in private.
[02:30:13.829 --> 02:30:24.077]  In 2007, Alex Jones releases Endgame, exposing the world elite's plans for covertly using biological weapons against all of mankind.
[02:30:24.077 --> 02:30:35.907]  And by the time they launched their attack in 2020, Alex Jones' InfoWars and our audience were there to warn the people of the deadly vaccines that we knew were coming.
[02:30:35.907 --> 02:30:37.448]  This is why they attack us.
[02:30:37.928 --> 02:30:40.451]  This is why we need your support.
[02:30:40.451 --> 02:30:42.234]  Because we tell the truth.
[02:30:42.234 --> 02:30:44.436]  Alex Jones was right.
[02:30:44.436 --> 02:30:45.878]  Join the resistance.
[02:30:45.878 --> 02:30:47.180]  Buy products.
[02:30:47.180 --> 02:30:48.982]  Donate to the cause.
[02:30:48.982 --> 02:30:50.364]  Share the links.

[02:30:52.767 --> 02:30:54.990]  And help us defeat the New World Order.
[02:30:58.487 --> 02:31:03.011]  Introducing our new incredible supplement line, InfoWars MD.
[02:31:03.011 --> 02:31:15.462]  Now in 60 seconds, it's hard to tell you how incredible these products are, but all of these products are already sold on store shelves under other brand names for up to twice the cost we're selling it to you.
[02:31:15.462 --> 02:31:16.663]  These are high-end.
[02:31:16.663 --> 02:31:17.724]  These are the very best.
[02:31:18.044 --> 02:31:20.506]  You know our Body's Ultimate Turmeric Formula is amazing?
[02:31:20.506 --> 02:31:21.026]  Well, guess what?
[02:31:21.026 --> 02:31:26.810]  We now have Turmeric 95 that's basically the same formula for a lower price.
[02:31:26.810 --> 02:31:29.452]  CBD oil of the highest quality.
[02:31:29.452 --> 02:31:36.337]  Up to 50% less than major competitors selling the exact high-quality full-spectrum CBD.
[02:31:36.337 --> 02:31:41.541]  And it goes on for all the new InfoWars MD products at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:31:41.541 --> 02:31:42.502]  The highest quality.
[02:31:42.782 --> 02:31:51.600]  Directly from the manufacturer to your door at prices up to 50%, in some cases 100% lower than what they're sold for in stores.
[02:31:51.600 --> 02:31:53.584]  M4 Wars MD at M4WarsStore.com.
[02:31:58.368 --> 02:32:11.044]  Mark Twain, one of America's greatest writers and satirists and minds, famously said more than 150 years ago, rumors of his demise had been greatly exaggerated.
[02:32:11.044 --> 02:32:14.228]  Because the newspapers kept saying he died decades before he did die.
[02:32:15.029 --> 02:32:17.331]  And it's the same PSYOP today.
[02:32:17.331 --> 02:32:24.896]  InfoWars is more influential and more powerful than ever because of your support, because the facts that we've covered is coming true.
[02:32:24.896 --> 02:32:33.723]  But if they can convince you we've been shut down, if they can convince you that we're going away, and you stop supporting, you stop spreading the word, then they do win.
[02:32:33.723 --> 02:32:39.407]  Ladies and gentlemen, there's only one group of people that can shut down InfoWars, and that's you, the viewers and listeners.
[02:32:39.907 --> 02:32:41.849]  If you decide we're done, we're done.
[02:32:41.849 --> 02:32:49.114]  If you decide to go to InfoWarsTore.com and get supplements and books and films and t-shirts and so much more, we will stay on the air indefinitely.
[02:32:49.114 --> 02:32:50.536]  It is all in your hands.
[02:32:50.536 --> 02:32:51.877]  So thanks for your support.
[02:32:51.877 --> 02:32:53.078]  Stand up against the globalists.
[02:32:53.078 --> 02:32:56.360]  Go to InfoWarsTore.com right now and keep us on air.
[02:32:56.360 --> 02:33:00.143]  It's up to you.
[02:33:00.143 --> 02:33:06.048]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:10.115 --> 02:33:16.939]  I've got a tiger by the tail, it's plain to see.
[02:33:16.939 --> 02:33:20.821]  I won't be much when you get through with me.
[02:33:20.821 --> 02:33:22.682]  He never gives up.
[02:33:22.682 --> 02:33:29.466]  He's Alex Jones, broadcasting from deep in the heart of Texas, worldwide.
[02:33:29.466 --> 02:33:33.548]  Well, I thought today I met you.
[02:33:33.548 --> 02:33:34.049]  Alright, Peter.
[02:33:34.049 --> 02:33:34.389]  Richard.
[02:33:36.903 --> 02:33:40.426]  Your calls are just up next.
[02:33:40.426 --> 02:33:41.887]  Peter in Washington, thanks for calling.
[02:33:41.887 --> 02:33:43.648]  Go ahead.
[02:33:43.648 --> 02:33:44.348]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:33:44.348 --> 02:33:51.113]  I think the thing is, it's like Clarice's first principles, Marcus Aurelius, what is this thing in and of itself?
[02:33:51.113 --> 02:33:53.274]  What is the thing in its constitution?
[02:33:53.274 --> 02:33:59.699]  What it is, is mortal men of flesh and blood, and the Vax is about power secondarily.
[02:33:59.699 --> 02:34:02.441]  It's first about life extension.
[02:34:02.441 --> 02:34:02.761]  Trump is
[02:34:03.732 --> 02:34:07.835]  He met with Gates and all of a sudden he changed his mind about vaccines.
[02:34:07.835 --> 02:34:11.058]  What might he have been told?
[02:34:11.058 --> 02:34:20.166]  He said in his inaugural speech, we have the keys to life, I'm going to fast track stuff that heals cancer, because they lied to him and said they had all the answers.
[02:34:21.428 --> 02:34:27.453]  Yep, and Jared has said we're either the first generation to live forever or the last to die.
[02:34:27.453 --> 02:34:29.215]  Jared has Trump's ear.
[02:34:29.215 --> 02:34:31.037]  He also has Elon's ear.
[02:34:31.037 --> 02:34:34.920]  He was in the box with Elon at the World Cup.
[02:34:34.920 --> 02:34:38.143]  So all three of them seek life extension.
[02:34:38.143 --> 02:34:46.691]  And the key about the power they seek is the power that they seek is to accelerate life extension technology research.
[02:34:47.549 --> 02:34:48.990]  That's what they want most.
[02:34:48.990 --> 02:34:50.410]  I 100% agree.
[02:34:50.410 --> 02:34:53.212]  My whole film, Endgame, is about that.
[02:34:53.212 --> 02:34:53.792]  Right.
[02:34:53.792 --> 02:35:02.236]  And so the thing is, when you look at what they've done, and you look at the vitriol that Elon came after you about, it was related to the Vaxx.
[02:35:02.236 --> 02:35:16.163]  And you had used, or a scholar had used a quote about the Millstone and children, and I think because that implicated Trump, who I believe is a supporter of the vaccine, he got especially angry and said he would never replatform you.
[02:35:17.453 --> 02:35:25.258]  The transhumanism that they may believe in, and the life extension technology they seek, is the real fundamental thing, and not power.
[02:35:25.258 --> 02:35:31.583]  Power is a means to an end, and freedom blocks the speed at which they can get their life extension technology.
[02:35:31.583 --> 02:35:35.066]  Well, Jerry Kushner came out and said he's never going to die.
[02:35:35.066 --> 02:35:41.811]  Right, and he backed off of it later, but I think once an old person who has everything in the world,
[02:35:42.435 --> 02:35:45.036]  Here's, we can make you live longer.
[02:35:45.036 --> 02:35:46.557]  They're like, whatever it takes.
[02:35:46.557 --> 02:35:48.757]  Well, we've got to legalize this and get it out there.
[02:35:48.757 --> 02:35:51.899]  So why wouldn't they bring a less dangerous one out front?
[02:35:51.899 --> 02:35:56.660]  Why would they bring something out that discredits the mRNA right up front?
[02:35:56.660 --> 02:36:02.282]  I think, number one, they didn't realize the level of resistance they'd be, and number two, they're in a hurry.
[02:36:02.282 --> 02:36:04.623]  The freedom slows down their research.
[02:36:04.623 --> 02:36:11.146]  If they have complete control over all of humanity, how long does research... Well, by the way, guys, cue up Benjamin Netanyahu on
[02:36:13.536 --> 02:36:36.012]  On the neocon king, Ben Shapiro, two months ago, well it was on his platform, it was with Jordan Peterson, and he says, all of Israel's a guinea pig, we don't know what hurt him or help him, but we're going to test all the new drugs on Israelis, and track all their genetics, and then we're going to find the keys to life through this.
[02:36:36.012 --> 02:36:41.716]  So they're saying, we're going to sacrifice Israelis, and make Israel the guinea pig testing center
[02:36:44.306 --> 02:36:47.570]  He says it right there.
[02:36:47.570 --> 02:36:47.951]  Yep.
[02:36:47.951 --> 02:36:51.395]  And the thing is, it could be different flavors.
[02:36:51.395 --> 02:36:55.360]  It could be far more, you know, mellow and not wanting to kill everybody.
[02:36:55.360 --> 02:37:02.670]  But fundamentally, if you're gonna make advances in technology quick enough to get a 70-something extra life, it's gotta be fast.
[02:37:03.163 --> 02:37:07.985]  An informed consent and sign on the dotted line, and do you realize the risk that this pose?
[02:37:07.985 --> 02:37:09.245]  People are not buying into that.
[02:37:09.245 --> 02:37:10.345]  No, that's it.
[02:37:10.345 --> 02:37:11.466]  That's it.
[02:37:11.466 --> 02:37:12.306]  Perfectly said.
[02:37:12.306 --> 02:37:13.146]  Best caller of the day.
[02:37:13.146 --> 02:37:14.166]  Amazing calls.
[02:37:14.166 --> 02:37:15.307]  Thank you, Peter.
[02:37:15.307 --> 02:37:16.347]  Damn right.
[02:37:16.347 --> 02:37:17.127]  Richard in New York.
[02:37:17.127 --> 02:37:17.607]  You're on the air.
[02:37:17.607 --> 02:37:17.968]  Go ahead.
[02:37:17.968 --> 02:37:20.328]  Hi, Alex.
[02:37:20.328 --> 02:37:21.009]  Can you hear me?
[02:37:21.009 --> 02:37:21.489]  I can, sir.
[02:37:21.489 --> 02:37:22.149]  Go ahead.
[02:37:22.149 --> 02:37:24.970]  You want to talk about the ultimate sin?
[02:37:24.970 --> 02:37:26.290]  Unpardonable sin.
[02:37:26.290 --> 02:37:30.291]  This is Matthew chapter 12, verse 31.
[02:37:33.132 --> 02:37:46.998]  I say unto you, all manner of sin and blasphemy shall be forgiven them, but the blasphemy against the Holy Ghost shall not be forgiven unto men.
[02:37:46.998 --> 02:37:56.102]  Whosoever speaketh against the Holy Ghost, it shall not be forgiven him, either in this world or in the world to come.
[02:37:56.102 --> 02:37:58.243]  We're in the world to come.
[02:37:58.243 --> 02:38:02.285]  The Holy Ghost is a key player here, but who is the Holy Ghost?
[02:38:03.098 --> 02:38:05.279]  Okay, here's... Let me ask your opinion.
[02:38:05.279 --> 02:38:07.740]  What is blasphemy against the Holy Ghost?
[02:38:07.740 --> 02:38:12.222]  That means the Holy Ghost comes to you and you reject it, and say, I hate you, I don't want you.
[02:38:12.222 --> 02:38:15.063]  Is that the ultimate sin?
[02:38:15.063 --> 02:38:16.804]  Yeah, well, it's part of it.
[02:38:16.804 --> 02:38:21.926]  But if you fail to know who the Holy Ghost is, you've missed the boat.
[02:38:21.926 --> 02:38:22.346]  Okay?
[02:38:22.346 --> 02:38:31.090]  In Revelations it says, and I shall send unto you another comforter who the world would not see, neither would they recognize him.
[02:38:31.090 --> 02:38:32.531]  In Acts, first chapter,
[02:38:34.294 --> 02:38:39.376]  You shall receive power after the Holy Ghost has fully come upon you.
[02:38:39.376 --> 02:38:41.337]  Who is the Holy Ghost?
[02:38:41.337 --> 02:38:43.858]  I'll get right to the point.
[02:38:43.858 --> 02:38:49.359]  The Holy Ghost is the re-emergence of Michael the Archangel in form.
[02:38:49.359 --> 02:38:59.763]  He is the first of the two witnesses who appear with Jesus, if you look at chapter 11 of the book of Revelation.
[02:39:00.487 --> 02:39:03.728]  It calls them the two golden candlesticks.
[02:39:03.728 --> 02:39:11.729]  Well, I would describe the Holy Ghost, and I think you're right, Archangel is bringing that, is the direct connection to God.
[02:39:11.729 --> 02:39:14.310]  Yes, and the Holy Ghost is... Wait a minute, Michael.
[02:39:14.310 --> 02:39:16.770]  I mean, wait a minute, Alex.
[02:39:16.770 --> 02:39:19.191]  The Holy Ghost has appeared.
[02:39:19.191 --> 02:39:20.731]  Has appeared.
[02:39:20.731 --> 02:39:21.271]  Okay?
[02:39:21.271 --> 02:39:23.412]  And everybody has denied it.
[02:39:23.412 --> 02:39:25.972]  They are not reading the instructions.
[02:39:25.972 --> 02:39:28.793]  When you get in trouble, read the instructions.
[02:39:29.207 --> 02:39:39.072]  And I will send unto you another comforter who the world will not see, neither would they recognize him, but he is the Holy Ghost and the Spirit of Truth.
[02:39:39.072 --> 02:39:45.635]  That has actually happened, including the second witness, okay?
[02:39:45.635 --> 02:39:54.520]  The first of the two witnesses is Michael the Archangel, who did appear again in the United States, not in Israel.
[02:39:54.520 --> 02:39:58.802]  He appeared in the United States in the Rocky Mountains, okay, in a little
[02:39:59.438 --> 02:40:03.119]  Stone Chapel on a mound of prairie grass.
[02:40:03.119 --> 02:40:06.681]  Would you like to hear his solution to this?
[02:40:06.681 --> 02:40:09.922]  Go ahead.
[02:40:09.922 --> 02:40:11.842]  Hello?
[02:40:11.842 --> 02:40:13.443]  Didn't cut you off.
[02:40:13.443 --> 02:40:14.703]  Okay.
[02:40:14.703 --> 02:40:27.448]  As we consider divine cosmic forces, which are possible of release in the earth, we know that if we were a sufficient number, 144,000 in the earth, and we were fully trained in the way of Jesus Christ,
[02:40:27.961 --> 02:40:51.294]  And if all were properly placed in the world of man, it would be possible to release a current of divine power in the earth so strong and so all-inclusive that all who would do wickedly and those who have chosen the way of evil, whoever and wherever they may be, would be almost instantly annihilated from the face of the earth in release of divine power.
[02:40:51.294 --> 02:40:55.957]  Those who were already dead to the reality of Jesus Christ would be killed.
[02:40:56.457 --> 02:41:04.304]  Such individuals would die far more and just as surely as if they were killed by any destructive methods known to man.
[02:41:04.304 --> 02:41:08.467]  Machine gun bullets could not be more effective.
[02:41:08.467 --> 02:41:16.494]  That is one of a little passage of 18 volumes created... Alright, brother, listen.
[02:41:16.494 --> 02:41:17.295]  Interesting call.
[02:41:17.295 --> 02:41:18.896]  I appreciate your call.
[02:41:18.896 --> 02:41:20.638]  And we gotta go to other people, but I will tell you this.
[02:41:21.710 --> 02:41:23.612]  The Holy Ghost is God's connection to the people.
[02:41:23.612 --> 02:41:29.076]  When God moves against your heart to try to get you to reach out, and if you refuse that, it's really bad.
[02:41:29.076 --> 02:41:31.058]  And it's 100% real.
[02:41:31.058 --> 02:41:33.080]  The enemy has their transmission.
[02:41:33.080 --> 02:41:35.142]  God has his transmission.
[02:41:35.142 --> 02:41:37.223]  And that's why they're trying to block that.
[02:41:37.223 --> 02:41:38.364]  All right, listen.
[02:41:38.364 --> 02:41:41.227]  We got one more segment left before the guest host takes over.
[02:41:41.227 --> 02:41:42.888]  So I got to get to Anonymous in Texas.
[02:41:43.979 --> 02:41:47.102]  I gotta get to Marvin, Russell, Mark, and Jefferson.
[02:41:47.102 --> 02:41:51.085]  So I will take all five of your calls in the next 11-minute segment.
[02:41:51.085 --> 02:41:52.326]  When we come back, get ready.
[02:41:52.326 --> 02:41:54.127]  I want to thank you all for your support.
[02:41:54.127 --> 02:41:57.290]  Incredible calls, so many angles, so many dimensions.
[02:41:57.290 --> 02:41:58.071]  I love taking calls.
[02:41:58.071 --> 02:42:03.055]  You know, as we've increased the calls, because I like the show and I take calls, and I think you like it as well.
[02:42:03.055 --> 02:42:04.996]  I had some guests lined up and we canceled them.
[02:42:04.996 --> 02:42:08.619]  We'll be back, obviously, with the Thursday and the Friday broadcast as well.
[02:42:09.500 --> 02:42:11.301]  I forget who's in the fourth hour today.
[02:42:11.301 --> 02:42:12.803]  Let me look that up.
[02:42:12.803 --> 02:42:15.104]  That'll be host Kate Daly.
[02:42:15.104 --> 02:42:18.307]  Always does a really stupendous job.
[02:42:18.307 --> 02:42:20.328]  But we're going to go to break.
[02:42:20.328 --> 02:42:21.930]  I got a bunch of breaking news here, too.
[02:42:21.930 --> 02:42:24.672]  So I'll probably do the first five minutes before Kate Daly comes on.
[02:42:24.672 --> 02:42:26.894]  But I want to go right to your phone calls.
[02:42:28.073 --> 02:42:31.414]  But man, we are living in such an insane time.
[02:42:31.414 --> 02:42:33.255]  There's a bunch of other articles I haven't gotten to here.
[02:42:33.255 --> 02:42:36.076]  Trudeau's censorship bill passes the Senate.
[02:42:36.076 --> 02:42:40.658]  That's in Canada, folks, where the government will monitor and censor you in live time.
[02:42:40.658 --> 02:42:43.219]  Tyranny isn't coming, it's here.
[02:42:43.219 --> 02:42:45.179]  And that's an incredible thing to admit.
[02:42:45.179 --> 02:42:54.823]  Band.video, InfoWars.com, and the new podcast channel I'm doing, sign up for free to be sent emails about the live shows, is AlexJonesLive.com.
[02:42:54.823 --> 02:42:55.163]  Be right back.
[02:42:57.921 --> 02:43:00.322]  Cavalry has arrived.
[02:43:00.322 --> 02:43:13.346]  Ultimate Bone Broth is the strongest, highest quality chicken-based bone broth you're going to find with all of the effects for your joints, your bones, your muscles, your heart, but more importantly, your immune system.

[02:43:57.865 --> 02:43:59.687]  InfoWars is winning.
[02:43:59.687 --> 02:44:01.729]  InfoWars is reaching more people than ever.
[02:44:01.729 --> 02:44:04.531]  We were supposed to be off the air months and months and months ago.
[02:44:04.531 --> 02:44:07.274]  Mainstream media told you, but it's not true.
[02:44:07.274 --> 02:44:09.376]  They told you we were going to be shut down.
[02:44:09.376 --> 02:44:11.438]  They told you we owed a billion and a half dollars.
[02:44:11.438 --> 02:44:12.419]  None of that's true.
[02:44:12.419 --> 02:44:13.780]  It's all being appealed.
[02:44:13.780 --> 02:44:15.902]  They want you to think InfoWars is dead.
[02:44:15.902 --> 02:44:22.328]  But if you simply stand up and support InfoWars, we've got years and years of appeals and we will not be taken off the air.
[02:44:22.748 --> 02:44:26.190]  But if they can convince you that we've been shut down, they're going to win.
[02:44:26.190 --> 02:44:28.891]  Don't let the globalists psyop you and your family.
[02:44:28.891 --> 02:44:38.775]  Go to Infowarshore.com and get incredible products, supplements, books, films, t-shirts, you name it, that fund the Infowar and empower your life and let the globalists know their psyop has not worked.

[02:44:40.596 --> 02:44:49.203]  Take action at InfoWarsTore.com today, because the only people who can take us off the air is you, the viewers and listeners.
[02:44:49.203 --> 02:44:52.485]  The majority of you have not been silenced, but some of you have.
[02:44:52.485 --> 02:44:54.467]  Do not let the gloveless brainwash you.
[02:44:54.467 --> 02:44:57.549]  Go to InfoWarsTore.com to keep us on the air.
[02:44:57.549 --> 02:45:01.092]  The most banned man in America, Alex Jones.
[02:45:05.816 --> 02:45:07.177]  I want you all to know something.
[02:45:07.177 --> 02:45:09.138]  Alex Jones was right.
[02:45:09.138 --> 02:45:12.680]  Alex is right about far more than is wrong.
[02:45:12.680 --> 02:45:15.642]  Alex has been right on for over a decade.
[02:45:15.642 --> 02:45:20.045]  I don't care how you slice it, dice it, flip it up or rub it down.
[02:45:20.045 --> 02:45:22.246]  Alex Jones was right.
[02:45:22.246 --> 02:45:25.789]  Think about how frustrated we are if you've been awake for a year or two.
[02:45:25.789 --> 02:45:29.231]  Imagine being like an Alex Jones or those guys have been awake for like decades.
[02:45:29.511 --> 02:45:32.372]  Alex Jones called this years ago.
[02:45:32.372 --> 02:45:33.392]  Years ago.
[02:45:33.392 --> 02:45:35.473]  Alex Jones never bought the Russia hoax.
[02:45:35.473 --> 02:45:37.474]  Not for a second.
[02:45:37.474 --> 02:45:39.995]  You are one of the great thinkers of this.
[02:45:39.995 --> 02:45:42.456]  You are a martyr to the First Amendment.
[02:45:42.456 --> 02:45:45.577]  The government fears Alex Jones.
[02:45:45.577 --> 02:45:47.437]  That's why the globalists hate me.
[02:45:47.437 --> 02:45:52.879]  It's because I'm exposing their corporate worldwide tyranny.
[02:45:52.879 --> 02:45:54.120]  AlexJonesLive.com
[02:45:57.907 --> 02:46:00.949]  InfoWars' secret weapon is finally here.
[02:46:00.949 --> 02:46:09.315]  It's a secret weapon for your immune system, for your stamina, for your energy, for your way of life, for your libido, and it also keeps InfoWars on the air.
[02:46:09.315 --> 02:46:18.861]  And I almost forgot, you save at least 50% on these products for what you pay for similar products or the exact same products in stores around the country.
[02:46:18.861 --> 02:46:24.325]  That's because we go right to the highest quality manufacturer in the nation that supplies some of the top names.
[02:46:24.325 --> 02:46:27.027]  They then give us the best deal out there, because the owner's a listener,
[02:46:27.267 --> 02:46:29.689]  We're able to bring it to you with massive discounts.
[02:46:29.689 --> 02:46:34.873]  You're not going to find 1,000 milligram high-quality CBD for anywhere near the price we sell it.
[02:46:34.873 --> 02:46:37.235]  You're not going to find it at the 10 milligram or the 20 milligram.
[02:46:37.235 --> 02:46:41.019]  You're not going to find turmeric at 95% humanoid at the price we're selling it.
[02:46:41.019 --> 02:46:43.681]  You're not going to find any of this anywhere near that.
[02:46:43.681 --> 02:46:49.786]  These similar formulas or the same formulas sell for up to 200% more than we're selling these.
[02:46:49.786 --> 02:46:54.150]  InfoWars MD, now available exclusively at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:46:54.150 --> 02:46:54.870]  A true 360 win.
[02:47:00.091 --> 02:47:04.714]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[02:47:04.714 --> 02:47:15.660]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:47:15.660 --> 02:47:16.880]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:47:16.880 --> 02:47:18.941]  Going right back to your phone calls.
[02:47:18.941 --> 02:47:20.222]  Anonymous in Texas.
[02:47:20.222 --> 02:47:20.762]  You're on the air.
[02:47:20.762 --> 02:47:22.423]  Go ahead.
[02:47:22.423 --> 02:47:24.404]  Alex, can you hear me?
[02:47:24.404 --> 02:47:24.764]  I can.
[02:47:24.764 --> 02:47:25.025]  Go ahead.
[02:47:25.025 --> 02:47:25.365]  You're on air.
[02:47:26.175 --> 02:47:26.595]  Awesome.
[02:47:26.595 --> 02:47:27.035]  Oh my god.
[02:47:27.035 --> 02:47:27.896]  I love you so much.
[02:47:27.896 --> 02:47:30.357]  Love you too.
[02:47:30.357 --> 02:47:35.059]  I'm calling because everyone needs to know about this.
[02:47:35.059 --> 02:47:36.740]  The cyber attack is not imminent.
[02:47:36.740 --> 02:47:37.960]  It's here.
[02:47:37.960 --> 02:47:41.642]  I've been perpetually hacked for about two years.
[02:47:41.642 --> 02:47:49.725]  All of my Apple devices, no matter what, no matter how many times I've replaced them, they all contain spyware.
[02:47:49.725 --> 02:47:52.447]  The devices have a spyware
[02:47:54.475 --> 02:47:59.178]  Very much like Pegasus, I don't know if you've heard of it, the NSO program.
[02:47:59.178 --> 02:48:09.503]  And basically what happens is that people, I don't know who, are downloading my pictures, my conversations, taking snapshots.
[02:48:09.503 --> 02:48:11.164]  Well, everybody knows about this.
[02:48:11.164 --> 02:48:13.306]  I talked about it 20 years ago, but now they admit it.
[02:48:13.306 --> 02:48:15.227]  You'll be talking about the weirdest thing
[02:48:16.403 --> 02:48:20.807]  And then you'll get ads on your phone about it so that it's creating text messages.
[02:48:20.807 --> 02:48:22.928]  It's recording you and sending it back to a database.
[02:48:22.928 --> 02:48:24.129]  The apps do it.
[02:48:24.129 --> 02:48:24.850]  Governments do it.
[02:48:24.850 --> 02:48:26.872]  Yeah, it's just a free-for-all.
[02:48:26.872 --> 02:48:29.154]  Well, it's actually the product.
[02:48:29.154 --> 02:48:30.675]  Apple is complicit.
[02:48:30.675 --> 02:48:34.398]  So are the telecommunications and internet providers.
[02:48:34.398 --> 02:48:45.287]  And, you know, the sad thing about this is that I've reported it to the Texas Attorney General, local police and state police and local police.
[02:48:45.905 --> 02:48:58.075]  For, you know, complaining and reporting that I've been attacked, cyber-attacked, I got thrown in a mental hospital for a week on an emergency detention order.
[02:48:58.075 --> 02:49:07.682]  So, I mean, there are plans for people who have mental history, depression, any kind of mental history, and I've seen it in the World Bank.
[02:49:10.332 --> 02:49:14.874]  Sure, you're talking about the red flag laws, where once you get flagged, they surveil you.
[02:49:14.874 --> 02:49:16.155]  I appreciate your call.
[02:49:16.155 --> 02:49:20.516]  Look, all I can tell you is, is that the internet is designed to control people.
[02:49:20.516 --> 02:49:21.857]  We've used it to reach out to people.
[02:49:21.857 --> 02:49:23.257]  The system doesn't like that.
[02:49:23.257 --> 02:49:24.698]  Marvin in Alabama, you're on the air.
[02:49:24.698 --> 02:49:25.258]  Marvin, go ahead.
[02:49:26.690 --> 02:49:28.492]  Hey Alex, a couple quick things.
[02:49:28.492 --> 02:49:44.928]  One, with the money and the grid shutting down, if that happens, we need to make it known loud and clear now, and with as big of names as possible, that when the power does come back on, everybody that has property, you know, in their possession, their house or whatever, it's theirs.
[02:49:44.928 --> 02:49:49.553]  I don't care if they owed a million dollars to the bank, if the bank wants to screw around like this,
[02:49:50.053 --> 02:49:50.314]  Right.
[02:49:50.314 --> 02:49:54.398]  At that point, self-defense is authorized and we have to help defend our neighbors.
[02:50:07.130 --> 02:50:14.955]  As far as the vaccine and Trump, this mental gymnastics that's out there that he had to do it to get things open back up.
[02:50:14.955 --> 02:50:19.738]  I mean, if people would just think this through for a minute, it's part of the strong delusion.
[02:50:19.738 --> 02:50:22.820]  Anybody that believes that, they've bought into the strong delusion.
[02:50:22.820 --> 02:50:27.943]  Because that's like saying, like Nancy Pelosi, we have to pass the bill to read the bill.
[02:50:27.943 --> 02:50:34.627]  And so we have to kill people, and lots, like 250 million people, in order to not kill people with the lockdowns?
[02:50:34.627 --> 02:50:35.568]  I mean, it's just absurd.
[02:50:35.956 --> 02:50:38.578]  I don't know what people are thinking.
[02:50:38.578 --> 02:50:57.951]  Plus, you can't really go with what he's saying anyways, because he's now saying that he wasn't for the lockdowns when he chastised the Georgia governor, when he chastised Sweden for opening back up, when he said that Massey needed to be thrown out of the Republican Party for making Congress come in to vote, you know, actually in person.
[02:50:58.365 --> 02:51:00.846]  You know, so he's rewriting history now.
[02:51:00.846 --> 02:51:02.026]  You just can't trust that.
[02:51:02.026 --> 02:51:06.127]  And the real sin of it all is complying with the papers, please.
[02:51:06.127 --> 02:51:11.848]  When the people, I heard your caller earlier, they got the shot that said, you know, sadly, so he could travel.
[02:51:11.848 --> 02:51:19.030]  That's way worse than just getting the shot, because now him getting the shot is sad, and I hope he's okay, but it doesn't affect me.
[02:51:19.030 --> 02:51:22.471]  But him showing his papers to travel, that affects me.
[02:51:22.851 --> 02:51:27.654]  And that's really the sin in all of this is when people comply and they show their papers.
[02:51:27.654 --> 02:51:30.716]  Sure, then it sets the precedent and you get deeper into the trap.
[02:51:30.716 --> 02:51:32.257]  You don't get more freedom by complying.
[02:51:32.257 --> 02:51:33.158]  We're not criticizing him.
[02:51:33.158 --> 02:51:34.138]  He's learned.
[02:51:34.138 --> 02:51:35.719]  You get more freedom by not complying.
[02:51:35.719 --> 02:51:36.740]  Thank you so much.
[02:51:36.740 --> 02:51:40.382]  Jefferson in Virginia, you're on the air.
[02:51:40.382 --> 02:51:41.143]  Hey, Alex.
[02:51:41.143 --> 02:51:42.884]  Yes, sir.
[02:51:42.884 --> 02:51:48.288]  I would be accused of being one of the strong delusion people, I guess.
[02:51:48.288 --> 02:51:51.910]  2021 without the vaccine was supposed to be a kill zone for Remdesivir.
[02:51:52.608 --> 02:51:55.869]  Trump, with warp speed, brought out the vaccine ahead of schedule.
[02:51:55.869 --> 02:52:04.891]  If you read the SPARS document, Colosseum was supposed to be... Well yeah, Fauci did that with AZT and HIV and AIDS.
[02:52:04.891 --> 02:52:06.711]  He killed millions with that.
[02:52:06.711 --> 02:52:08.351]  I mean, I get what was going on.
[02:52:08.351 --> 02:52:11.492]  I get they told Trump, bring this out, it'll save people.
[02:52:11.492 --> 02:52:14.933]  But I mean, still, Trump now knows all this, he should come out against it.
[02:52:16.670 --> 02:52:24.698]  I think he will, but the point is what I'm saying is he saved four million older Americans from getting killed with Remdesivir in 2021 because they weren't vaccinated.
[02:52:24.698 --> 02:52:34.086]  So when they got sick anyway, the hospitals couldn't kill the people who were vaccinated with Remdesivir because that would have made the whole vaccine not work at all.
[02:52:34.086 --> 02:52:41.313]  So they gave different medical treatment to people that were vaccinated compared to people that were unvaccinated because the vaccine came out early.
[02:52:41.313 --> 02:52:42.474]  So that messed up their plan.
[02:52:42.918 --> 02:52:51.743]  They wanted us to get the Christmas of 2021, and then they'd come out with the vaccine, and then with our pent-up demand, because we're in a panic, because 4 million Americans died.
[02:52:51.743 --> 02:52:55.044]  And then say that the virus killed people when it was really rendezvous.
[02:52:55.044 --> 02:52:56.365]  Correct.
[02:52:56.365 --> 02:52:57.906]  That was the plan.
[02:52:57.906 --> 02:52:59.067]  And he messed that up for them.
[02:52:59.067 --> 02:53:03.489]  So he actually did save Americans, and I'm sure he thought there was probably an antidote.
[02:53:04.167 --> 02:53:08.250]  Well, look, I mean, I think it's open for debate, but people only obsessing on Trump is a diversion.
[02:53:08.250 --> 02:53:09.770]  The globalists definitely don't like Trump.
[02:53:09.770 --> 02:53:11.391]  He's actually trying to be president.
[02:53:11.391 --> 02:53:13.633]  We've got to worry about what they're up to.
[02:53:13.633 --> 02:53:17.155]  At the same time, push Trump to tell the truth about the shot, which he's starting to do.
[02:53:34.724 --> 02:53:35.825]  Yeah, it's coming around.
[02:53:35.825 --> 02:53:37.125]  It'll work out alright.
[02:53:37.125 --> 02:53:38.967]  We should have a good time.
[02:53:38.967 --> 02:53:40.427]  Thanks for the call, Jefferson.
[02:53:40.427 --> 02:53:42.709]  Russell in California, last caller here on the air.
[02:53:42.709 --> 02:53:46.131]  Hi Alex, thank you for taking my call.
[02:53:46.131 --> 02:53:46.551]  Thank you.
[02:53:46.551 --> 02:53:50.213]  I'm gonna let some cats out of the bag here.
[02:53:50.213 --> 02:53:59.739]  The Chinese fly balloon, according to my aerospace type, I got some people in low and high places.
[02:53:59.739 --> 02:54:04.362]  We suspect that the Chinese were doing what's known as
[02:54:05.020 --> 02:54:06.701]  Turcom radar.
[02:54:06.701 --> 02:54:16.807]  In other words, they are mapping the United States from Alaska and across the United States with what's known as Turcom radar.
[02:54:16.807 --> 02:54:30.436]  When you pop an EMP device, you're going to take out a large portion of the infrastructure, electricity, GPS satellites will have to be taken out in a combat situation.
[02:54:30.436 --> 02:54:34.058]  So once GPS is gone, you're grounding all flight.
[02:54:35.976 --> 02:54:45.223]  Today's missiles use both GPS and what's known as Turcom radar, especially cruise missiles.
[02:54:45.223 --> 02:54:51.227]  These crews, the Soviet and the Chinese, are about 10 years behind us.
[02:54:51.227 --> 02:55:03.276]  And with their subsonic missiles, they need the old school Turcom radar capability to hit targets
[02:55:04.762 --> 02:55:09.645]  After a GMP attack.
[02:55:09.645 --> 02:55:16.549]  And you can't do ground reading radar from space?
[02:55:16.549 --> 02:55:17.530]  No, no.
[02:55:17.530 --> 02:55:30.298]  Because what you want to do, and that was the reason why this balloon was at the altitude it was, it can take a better picture of terrain.
[02:55:30.298 --> 02:55:32.359]  Sure, instead of shooting through thicker atmosphere.
[02:55:33.570 --> 02:55:59.898]  Right, exactly, and landmarks, and if it had a turcom capability for it, it could also see through vegetation, trees, it could probably, this thing probably mapped, could map the, we have systems that I know of in existence that can map how many inches it is from the edge of the street to your front door.
[02:56:02.697 --> 02:56:16.737]  That being said, what the Chinese were doing, and I think Biden needs to be impeached because we will never find out the true meaning of this balloon and why these balloons are being sent and so forth.
[02:56:17.210 --> 02:56:19.753]  I think it's to benefit the Chinese and the Russians.
[02:56:36.613 --> 02:56:38.114]  All right, we're going to go on a break.
[02:56:38.114 --> 02:56:44.178]  We have a very important Gregory's Report coming up, and then we're going to have Kate Daly take over.
[02:56:44.178 --> 02:56:45.819]  I'll be back tomorrow, 11 a.m.
[02:56:45.819 --> 02:56:46.600]  Central.
[02:56:46.600 --> 02:56:47.941]  Harrison Smith is 8 a.m.
[02:56:47.941 --> 02:56:49.422]  Central with American Journal.
[02:56:49.422 --> 02:56:54.405]  Owen Schroer is in about an hour and five minutes with The War Room, 3 p.m.
[02:56:54.405 --> 02:56:56.066]  Central Standard Time.
[02:56:56.066 --> 02:56:57.027]  That is coming up.
[02:56:57.027 --> 02:56:59.629]  This is a really powerful report.
[02:57:01.072 --> 02:57:04.113]  The Fed needs another 9-11 that I aired at the start of the show.
[02:57:04.113 --> 02:57:08.936]  Hope everybody shares it at Band.Video and InfoWars.com forward slash show.
[02:57:08.936 --> 02:57:12.357]  But whatever you do, watch this report because he's dead right.
[02:57:12.357 --> 02:57:16.319]  The deep state needs a big crisis to get themselves out of the trouble they're in.
[02:57:16.319 --> 02:57:19.001]  The question is, what will that big event be?
[02:57:19.001 --> 02:57:21.802]  I want to thank you all for your word of mouth, your prayer keeping us on air.
[02:57:21.802 --> 02:57:23.363]  Without you, we're not going to be here.
[02:57:23.363 --> 02:57:24.683]  You know who you are that supported us.
[02:57:24.683 --> 02:57:25.204]  I salute you.
[02:57:25.204 --> 02:57:29.526]  If you haven't supported, please get great products at the same time while you support InfoWarsTour.com.
[02:57:30.501 --> 02:57:31.221]  All right.
[02:57:31.221 --> 02:57:32.222]  Great job to the crew.
[02:57:32.222 --> 02:57:33.542]  Hour number four.
[02:57:33.542 --> 02:57:39.185]  Kicked off with Greg Reese and the Deep State needing a new 9-11, and then Kate Daly.
[02:57:39.185 --> 02:57:49.170]  We'll be right back with hour number four.
[02:57:49.170 --> 02:57:52.311]  I talk a lot about the great successes InfoWars has had.
[02:57:52.311 --> 02:57:54.612]  I don't think anybody can deny it.
[02:57:54.612 --> 02:57:57.634]  And it is because of listeners and viewers supporting us.
[02:57:58.542 --> 02:58:07.467]  When we talk about the crew at Infowars, people behind the scenes, the researchers, the writers, they really have been the MVPs in this fight.
[02:58:07.467 --> 02:58:14.350]  And we look at Harrison Smith and Owen Schroer and the hard work they engage in every day, five, six, seven days a week.
[02:58:14.350 --> 02:58:15.251]  It's really just incredible.
[02:58:16.289 --> 02:58:19.913]  So for myself and the whole InfoWars crew, I thank you for your past support.
[02:58:19.913 --> 02:58:25.718]  I only encourage you now to realize that InfoWars cannot stay on air if you do not support us.
[02:58:25.718 --> 02:58:28.761]  I know you spread the word, I know you pray for us, and that's wonderful, keep doing it.
[02:58:28.761 --> 02:58:37.689]  But most viewers and listeners never go to InfoWarsStore.com, and you never buy great products that enrich and empower your life, while at the same time keeping us on air.
[02:58:37.689 --> 02:58:41.093]  I know that less than 1% of our listeners actually go buy products at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:58:41.993 --> 02:58:46.574]  If just 1% more of you took action and went to InfoWarsStore.com, our funding problems will be over.
[02:59:04.318 --> 02:59:04.818]  Thank you.
[02:59:20.746 --> 02:59:26.349]  Our turmeric formula is 95% humanoid, the strongest and best on the market.
[02:59:26.349 --> 02:59:32.011]  These formulas and more under the InfoWars MD banner are at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:59:32.011 --> 02:59:41.156]  They are private labeled clones of the top brands in the country for up to 50% off where you're going to find them in stores and other online stores.
[02:59:41.156 --> 02:59:44.037]  This is our new InfoWars MD Incredible line.
[02:59:51.397 --> 02:59:55.334]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[03:00:04.355 --> 03:00:09.900]  Why would anyone think that our corrupt government sees Communist China as an enemy?
[03:00:09.900 --> 03:00:13.743]  They have been close partners for over 50 years.
[03:00:13.743 --> 03:00:28.536]  In 1971, after Mao Zedong spent years calling for the invasion of America, Henry Kissinger, acting as President Nixon's special representative, secretly traveled to Beijing to open business relations with the CCP.
[03:00:29.396 --> 03:00:30.417]  George H.W.
[03:00:30.417 --> 03:00:33.841]  Bush then went to China as the director of the U.S.
[03:00:33.841 --> 03:00:40.748]  liaison office and paved the way for multinational outsourcing of America's labor markets.
[03:00:40.748 --> 03:00:49.137]  Fast forward to 2001, the inside job of taking down the Twin Towers accomplished many things for the corrupt U.S.
[03:00:49.137 --> 03:00:49.538]  government.
[03:00:49.998 --> 03:00:57.867]  It was the Pearl Harbor event that the neocons wrote they needed to launch their plan for a new American century.
[03:00:57.867 --> 03:01:03.994]  It was the catalyst for the Patriot Act, which is being used today to target American patriots.
[03:01:03.994 --> 03:01:07.437]  And it was a way to account for trillions of missing dollars.
[03:01:08.218 --> 03:01:11.540]  On the afternoon of September 10th, 2001, U.S.
[03:01:11.540 --> 03:01:20.185]  Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld announced that the Pentagon was unable to account for 2.3 trillion dollars.
[03:01:20.185 --> 03:01:25.707]  The technology revolution has transformed organizations across the private sector.
[03:01:25.707 --> 03:01:29.850]  But not ours, not fully, not yet.
[03:01:29.850 --> 03:01:33.972]  We are, as they say, tangled in our anchor chain.
[03:01:35.447 --> 03:01:37.889]  Our financial systems are decades old.
[03:01:37.889 --> 03:01:43.492]  According to some estimates, we cannot track 2.3 trillion dollars in transactions.
[03:01:43.492 --> 03:01:50.377]  The very next day, on 9-11, the Pentagon's budget offices took a direct hit and was destroyed.
[03:01:51.017 --> 03:01:59.624]  The markets closed for two weeks, banks all across the nation were closed, and the missing $2.3 trillion was forgotten.
[03:01:59.624 --> 03:02:10.072]  With overwhelming evidence of 9-11 being a series of controlled demolitions, the debris and wreckage from the felled towers was not investigated.
[03:02:10.072 --> 03:02:13.115]  Instead, it was immediately shipped off to China.
[03:02:13.675 --> 03:02:19.477]  And on December 11th of that same year, China became a member of the World Trade Organization.
[03:02:19.477 --> 03:02:28.201]  Having been given favorable trading status by the U.S., the CCP was virtually exempt from violating human rights violations.
[03:02:28.201 --> 03:02:35.864]  And millions of Americans began losing their jobs as manufacturing was outsourced to CCP slave labor factories.
[03:02:36.744 --> 03:02:39.187]  Fast forward to the current era.
[03:02:39.187 --> 03:02:55.405]  Our government worked with the Communist Chinese to weaponize COVID-19 and to further destabilize the American economy with forced lockdowns and deadly experimental vaccines that are still killing people to this day, including children.
[03:02:56.105 --> 03:02:56.685]  The U.S.
[03:02:56.685 --> 03:03:06.670]  Bureau of Labor Statistics desperately publishes a fake jobs report claiming over 500,000 jobs when the actual numbers are more like 80,000.
[03:03:06.670 --> 03:03:10.812]  The housing market is collapsing.
[03:03:10.812 --> 03:03:13.874]  41% of small businesses can't pay their rent.
[03:03:13.874 --> 03:03:14.454]  The U.S.
[03:03:14.454 --> 03:03:17.295]  debt is at $31 trillion.
[03:03:17.295 --> 03:03:21.718]  The Federal Reserve Bank is backed into a corner and the crooked U.S.
[03:03:21.718 --> 03:03:23.498]  government needs another 9-11.
[03:03:24.839 --> 03:03:33.305]  And right on cue, a giant balloon, big enough to be seen by all, slowly creeps across the American skies.
[03:03:33.305 --> 03:03:37.427]  The average American is now talking about EMPs.
[03:03:37.427 --> 03:03:42.971]  Our government's partner, the CCP, takes credit, and a new Bin Laden is born.
[03:03:43.471 --> 03:03:57.542]  The stage is now set for an EMP attack so that the banks have an excuse to close, steal the rest of America's wealth, making way for the CCP's digital yuan to become the new world reserve currency.
[03:03:57.542 --> 03:03:59.243]  They are probing us everywhere, Martha.
[03:03:59.243 --> 03:04:02.145]  They're probing us in the Pacific with their fighter aircraft.
[03:04:02.145 --> 03:04:04.667]  We had a close incident not too many weeks ago.
[03:04:04.667 --> 03:04:07.209]  They're probing us in our home by putting propaganda on TikTok.
[03:04:07.749 --> 03:04:09.230]  ...poisoning our children.
[03:04:09.230 --> 03:04:10.731]  They're working in our schools and universities.
[03:04:10.731 --> 03:04:14.814]  This is just another example of the Chinese Communist Party's aggression.
[03:04:14.814 --> 03:04:20.498]  Why would anyone think that our government is enemies with the Communist Chinese?
[03:04:20.498 --> 03:04:22.820]  Reporting for InfoWars, this is Greg Reese.
[03:04:58.260 --> 03:04:58.520]  If you go
[03:05:18.234 --> 03:05:19.855]  That features natokinase.
[03:05:19.855 --> 03:05:22.196]  It's a natural proteolytic enzyme.
[03:05:22.196 --> 03:05:27.879]  This one is the only enzyme that we're aware of right now that dissolves the spike protein.
[03:05:27.879 --> 03:05:28.680]  This is very important.
[03:05:28.680 --> 03:05:33.723]  The spike protein is loaded in the body with the COVID-19 infection and definitely with the vaccines.
[03:05:33.723 --> 03:05:35.224]  People are low with the spike protein.
[03:05:35.224 --> 03:05:36.184]  They don't feel well.
[03:05:36.184 --> 03:05:37.885]  This is a potential solution.
[03:05:37.885 --> 03:05:40.947]  Hydroxychloroquine comes from a natural substance.
[03:05:40.947 --> 03:05:43.868]  So does ivermectin and now natokinase.
[03:05:43.868 --> 03:05:44.829]  Isn't it interesting?
[03:05:45.229 --> 03:05:51.339]  Natural substances, in a sense, combating this man-made disaster, SARS-CoV-2 and the vaccines.
[03:05:51.339 --> 03:05:55.845]  Onlinehealthnow.com, thank you for your support, and thank you for getting into that, because it's important.
[03:05:55.845 --> 03:05:57.448]  You didn't come here to do that, but I made you do it.
[03:06:01.986 --> 03:06:03.267]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:06:03.267 --> 03:06:06.068]  I'm Kate Dally, your guest host from katedallyradio.com.
[03:06:06.068 --> 03:06:08.969]  So glad you're joining me in this last hour.
[03:06:08.969 --> 03:06:15.513]  Tackling some great subjects today, I have some information for you on the so-called Chinese balloon, and I'll tackle that in a few minutes.
[03:06:15.513 --> 03:06:20.415]  My first, or my guest today, for these first few segments will be Dr. Simone Gold.
[03:06:20.415 --> 03:06:26.398]  She's founder of the American Frontline Doctors, also targeted and incarcerated for merely giving a speech.
[03:06:26.954 --> 03:06:45.715]  On January 6th as an invited guest and of course, you know, Dr. Simone Gold, if you're unaware, been living in a cave, she is an MD, she is a JD, she's a licensed emergency physician and attorney visionary who led the pivotal, pivotal press conference event that broke the spell of coronavirus
[03:06:46.235 --> 03:06:51.820]  Panic in 2020, thank goodness, and created the most viral moment in modern media history.
[03:06:51.820 --> 03:07:02.189]  She became the founder of America's Frontline Doctors, the AFLDS, and now leads the nationwide movement to drain the science swamp, and I'm so happy to have her on the show.
[03:07:02.189 --> 03:07:09.395]  Dr. Gold, I know many out there are wondering about the government incarcerating you, actually incarcerating you, in a maximum prison.
[03:07:10.135 --> 03:07:15.539]  For giving a speech on health care in January 6 and you were demonized and fraudulently charged.
[03:07:15.539 --> 03:07:17.320]  Many are wondering about your experience.
[03:07:17.320 --> 03:07:22.564]  Would you speak to that before we get to the very, very important lawsuit that we need to discuss?
[03:07:22.564 --> 03:07:24.386]  But tell everybody about your experience.
[03:07:24.386 --> 03:07:24.866]  They need to hear.
[03:07:26.884 --> 03:07:40.145]  Yes, it was very shocking when the judge sentenced me to 60 days incarceration and it was even more shocking when the Bureau of Prison then sent me to FTC Miami, which is a maximum security facility, not at all matching the
[03:07:42.404 --> 03:07:47.586]  The plea agreement for misdemeanor trespass.
[03:07:47.586 --> 03:07:54.730]  I want to remind everybody that I've never heard of anybody going to prison for a misdemeanor, let alone a maximum security facility.
[03:07:54.730 --> 03:07:56.051]  I was very scared when I went.
[03:07:56.051 --> 03:07:56.951]  I mean, I'm not going to lie.
[03:07:56.951 --> 03:08:03.955]  It was a pretty intimidating environment in which a doctor, lawyer, mom, middle-aged, could find herself.
[03:08:03.955 --> 03:08:08.597]  But when I arrived there, they put me in isolation, which was horrific.
[03:08:10.422 --> 03:08:11.363]  That's what they did to the women.
[03:08:11.363 --> 03:08:12.844]  They didn't do that to the men.
[03:08:12.844 --> 03:08:18.628]  They did that ostensibly for COVID policies, but it was nonsense because they just didn't want to open up a ward for COVID.
[03:08:18.628 --> 03:08:20.209]  They just put the women in isolation.
[03:08:20.209 --> 03:08:21.510]  It was really terrible.
[03:08:21.510 --> 03:08:22.491]  Six by 10 cell.
[03:08:22.491 --> 03:08:23.591]  I spent eight days there.
[03:08:23.591 --> 03:08:31.877]  Then general population with people that were really high security risk, medium security risk and low security risk like myself.
[03:08:31.877 --> 03:08:33.258]  And it was tough.
[03:08:33.258 --> 03:08:35.920]  It was tough.
[03:08:35.920 --> 03:08:36.901]  I can only imagine.
[03:08:36.901 --> 03:08:39.322]  I can't imagine how terrifying that would be.
[03:08:39.322 --> 03:08:39.983]  Just terrifying.
[03:08:41.721 --> 03:08:43.885]  Yeah, you know, it was tough.
[03:08:43.885 --> 03:08:48.735]  I mean, I'm a very busy person and so in the back of my mind was always work and things I had to do with work.
[03:08:48.735 --> 03:08:50.238]  But when you're in there, you know, time kind of
[03:08:50.962 --> 03:08:51.443]  We're good to go.
[03:09:13.682 --> 03:09:18.107]  Politically conservative people really need to wake up to what's going on in our criminal justice system.
[03:09:18.107 --> 03:09:26.095]  At least on the women's side, there was a lot of people that really should not be held in prison and our government just puts them in for a decade and throws away the key and it's really not appropriate.
[03:09:26.095 --> 03:09:28.398]  Those stories are fascinating and I will bring them to light one day.
[03:09:29.468 --> 03:09:30.448]  I'm so glad to hear that.
[03:09:30.448 --> 03:09:31.669]  Thank you for that.
[03:09:31.669 --> 03:09:33.709]  You have a new website called GoldCare.com.
[03:09:33.709 --> 03:09:36.590]  I really hope people check it out.
[03:09:36.590 --> 03:09:40.171]  Without Dr. Gold's efforts, I would most likely be a widow today.
[03:09:40.171 --> 03:09:53.696]  So I owe a lot to her in the way of waking so many people up and making sure that they got the right protocols to save their loved ones from the hospital, the socialized medicine hospital situation that was going on and is going on today.
[03:09:54.777 --> 03:10:02.907]  So, let's talk about what's going on with the doctors, especially in California, these new scary, scary things that are happening.
[03:10:02.907 --> 03:10:04.689]  Will you please let everybody know about those?
[03:10:06.013 --> 03:10:07.054]  Oh my gosh, so you're right.
[03:10:07.054 --> 03:10:07.855]  You hit the nail on the head.
[03:10:07.855 --> 03:10:10.097]  We have socialized medicine in this country.
[03:10:10.097 --> 03:10:17.683]  Even if you've got private insurance, all policies are set by Medicare and the government, and your downstream private insurance really follows those policies.
[03:10:17.683 --> 03:10:31.054]  More importantly than even that is that we simply have like large influential stakeholders, like large hospital groups, for example, that are following government edicts to then do what the government wants.
[03:10:31.054 --> 03:10:33.336]  So we saw this in the era of COVID.
[03:10:33.336 --> 03:10:33.896]  We saw the
[03:10:35.069 --> 03:10:42.077]  Government say do XYZ policy and if you comply with XYZ policy, you'll get extra money.
[03:10:42.077 --> 03:10:45.201]  That's what we saw in 2020-2021.
[03:10:45.201 --> 03:10:53.210]  And it was very blatant that the doctor-patient relationship was really unimportant compared to the employer
[03:10:53.940 --> 03:10:55.301]  Employee doctor relationship.
[03:10:55.301 --> 03:11:02.188]  So the corporate hospital employer was listening to the government, getting money from the government to not put the patient's interest first.
[03:11:02.188 --> 03:11:03.149]  And this was very tragic.
[03:11:03.149 --> 03:11:04.490]  This is what we saw.
[03:11:04.490 --> 03:11:10.476]  And the bigger concern for this is that all of our health care costs amount to about 20% of our economy.
[03:11:12.608 --> 03:11:19.493]  And if we're allowing 20% of our economy to be essentially socialized anyway, for me this is a national security risk.
[03:11:19.493 --> 03:11:28.440]  This is us tending towards an entire nation of a socialized economy and we just saw that loud and clear, you know, in the last three years.
[03:11:28.440 --> 03:11:37.186]  Yes, Americans were truly faced with the idea that the doctors will do what they want to do and then tell you how that care is going to go and people did not have a say.
[03:11:38.339 --> 03:11:43.443]  Could I, I really just, I shouldn't, I want to be really specific because you mentioned about your family, right?
[03:11:43.443 --> 03:11:52.270]  So I, there was direct policies where Medicare would pay the hospital more if they put you on a lethal protocol.
[03:11:52.270 --> 03:11:54.212]  I mean, that is shocking information.
[03:11:54.212 --> 03:12:00.337]  If you came into the hospital with COVID and you were admitted, which they always wanted to do because they got a very large payment.
[03:12:00.877 --> 03:12:05.158]  And you went on Remdesivir and did not go on Ivermectin.
[03:12:05.158 --> 03:12:09.059]  The hospital got a large, I don't want to say bonus, but like a large payout.
[03:12:09.059 --> 03:12:11.900]  And this is how we knew the system was corrupt beyond repair.
[03:12:11.900 --> 03:12:16.542]  Because if it was just the money, the lobbying to get Remdesivir paid, that'd be one thing.
[03:12:16.542 --> 03:12:19.422]  But why then not allow the patient to get Ivermectin?
[03:12:19.422 --> 03:12:19.843]  Why that?
[03:12:19.843 --> 03:12:24.484]  And you had to wonder if Medicare policies were set to actually kill people.
[03:12:25.689 --> 03:12:35.653]  And ivermectin was proven to be safe and effective for over 60 years and remdesivir was just out of the gate after a failed trial with Ebola where it caused too much death.
[03:12:35.653 --> 03:12:36.353]  Yes, exactly.
[03:12:36.353 --> 03:12:40.034]  So hydroxychloroquine was FDA approved for almost 70 years.
[03:12:40.034 --> 03:12:41.495]  It's used all over the world.
[03:12:41.495 --> 03:12:42.355]  It's a very safe drug.
[03:12:42.355 --> 03:12:45.737]  Ivermectin, a precursor, actually won the Nobel Prize in Medicine.
[03:12:45.737 --> 03:12:47.357]  And remdesivir is a failed drug.
[03:12:47.357 --> 03:12:51.459]  Remdesivir was too dangerous to use with the lethal Ebola virus.
[03:12:51.459 --> 03:12:54.780]  But suddenly we're using it for the much more mild SARS virus?
[03:12:56.114 --> 03:12:57.396]  It didn't make sense.
[03:12:57.396 --> 03:13:05.463]  And the doctors were told to smile and say safe and effective and we all knew the elephant in the room and that was it had been out for two seconds and failed a trial.
[03:13:05.463 --> 03:13:09.486]  So for them to even say that was a lie, straight-up lie to the patient's face.
[03:13:09.486 --> 03:13:16.152]  And so it was so destructive, so evil what was going on and you stepped out in the forefront, risked everything.
[03:13:16.152 --> 03:13:19.335]  You didn't know you were risking everything at the time, did you?
[03:13:19.335 --> 03:13:20.176]  I did not.
[03:13:20.176 --> 03:13:21.437]  People asked me, I had no idea.
[03:13:22.648 --> 03:13:27.169]  You know, I just wanted to say, you know, my reputation has been really badly maligned.
[03:13:27.169 --> 03:13:29.290]  And really, I'm a person who came up through the system.
[03:13:29.290 --> 03:13:33.811]  I mean, right up until 2020, you couldn't say anything bad about me, you couldn't find anything bad about me.
[03:13:33.811 --> 03:13:43.734]  I went to law school, I went to medical school, had top grades, had no conflict, had no complaints, had no man mouth situations, lawsuits, nothing, literally zero.
[03:13:43.734 --> 03:13:46.935]  I was very much a product of the system.
[03:13:46.935 --> 03:13:47.915]  You must be over the target.
[03:13:50.484 --> 03:13:51.965]  I am definitely over the target.
[03:13:51.965 --> 03:13:52.746]  I accept that.
[03:13:52.746 --> 03:13:54.527]  I am most definitely over the target.
[03:13:54.527 --> 03:13:57.490]  And the target is, you know, human slavery.
[03:13:57.490 --> 03:13:59.471]  And we're not going to allow it.
[03:13:59.471 --> 03:14:01.273]  It's amazing to me what's happened.
[03:14:01.273 --> 03:14:07.377]  And so you have something new and I'm so glad that you've got this because this is such a huge, huge, big deal.
[03:14:07.377 --> 03:14:08.498]  Gold Care is amazing.
[03:14:08.498 --> 03:14:10.460]  And this is what everybody was clamoring for.
[03:14:10.460 --> 03:14:12.361]  We were thinking, well, what options do we have?
[03:14:12.361 --> 03:14:14.223]  This is a huge option I want people to know about.
[03:14:15.461 --> 03:14:16.662]  Yes, this is really important.
[03:14:16.662 --> 03:14:20.304]  So for the first year or two, everybody asked me how they could find early treatment.
[03:14:20.304 --> 03:14:27.689]  And then for the next year or two, everybody asked me how can I find an ethical, honorable doctor who won't lie to me, who will put me first, doctor-patient relationship.
[03:14:27.689 --> 03:14:30.130]  Let me tell you something, Kate, it's been pretty hard.
[03:14:30.130 --> 03:14:39.936]  We've amassed over the last few years those doctors that are like me, that are like-minded, that understand, you know, the patient comes first and that there should be no conflict between, you know, what's best for the patient.
[03:14:39.936 --> 03:14:41.137]  That should be the only thing that matters.
[03:14:41.557 --> 03:14:46.419]  When you put a financial intermediary, the government or an insurance company, in between that relationship, it all goes wrong.
[03:14:46.419 --> 03:14:47.540]  It all goes south.
[03:14:47.540 --> 03:14:53.483]  So, GoalCare.com steps aside from the medical Marxist model that's currently running our healthcare institutions.
[03:14:53.483 --> 03:14:57.324]  We went from caring about the doctor-patient relationship and scientific integrity.
[03:14:57.324 --> 03:15:03.487]  We went to equity and diversity and health equality and one-size-fits-all pharmaceuticals.
[03:15:03.487 --> 03:15:04.848]  Literally, that's what's happened.
[03:15:04.848 --> 03:15:07.049]  So, patients need to have an unbiased
[03:15:07.609 --> 03:15:10.992]  I'm smart advisor who they can trust.
[03:15:10.992 --> 03:15:23.281]  I mean, that's what most of medical care is, is, you know, going to some smart person who's had a lot of education, a lot of experience, who gives you unbiased advice exactly like you might get from an attorney you pay, or tax account, or real estate specialist.
[03:15:23.281 --> 03:15:29.506]  You know that they're not biased other than, you know, your interest because they want to work with you, they want to make their commission, or whatever the thing is.
[03:15:29.506 --> 03:15:31.968]  But that's what we need to bring back to medicine, free market forces.
[03:15:33.078 --> 03:15:44.510]  We're going to come right back more with Simone Gold but somebody that understands health instead of how to push more pharma because that's the whole idea now in the hospitals and when you go into these clinics it's pushing pharma, pushing pharma.
[03:15:44.510 --> 03:15:46.692]  I'm going to be right back with Dr. Simone Gold.
[03:15:46.692 --> 03:15:50.816]  We'll talk a little bit more about California, what's happening to the doctors there because it's scary.
[03:15:50.816 --> 03:15:52.457]  It's going to happen all over.
[03:15:52.457 --> 03:15:53.859]  Be right back on the Alex Jones Show!
[03:15:56.860 --> 03:16:00.222]  Everybody that's watching this needs to support Alex Jones.
[03:16:00.222 --> 03:16:03.024]  Needs to support InfoWars and Band.Video.
[03:16:03.024 --> 03:16:05.686]  You know, the Bible says, let another mouth praise you.
[03:16:05.686 --> 03:16:07.046]  I'm gonna do that right now.
[03:16:07.046 --> 03:16:10.949]  Alex Jones has helped so many people in this industry.
[03:16:10.949 --> 03:16:15.832]  You guys have no idea how many people have got their first start like Savannah Hernandez.
[03:16:16.152 --> 03:16:22.316]  How many people have just been put on a launch pad to outer space because of Alex Jones, including myself?
[03:16:22.316 --> 03:16:30.961]  I've been given so many opportunities because of this man and because of this platform, and I would probably not even be half of where I am right now if it weren't for Alex Jones.
[03:16:30.961 --> 03:16:36.644]  I mean, I've been able to be on podcasts with Alex and Joe Rogan and TimCast, the super TimCast IRL.
[03:16:36.644 --> 03:16:42.047]  Listen, what I'm saying is, do not take Alex Jones and Bandot video for granted.
[03:16:42.287 --> 03:16:44.769]  Because you don't know what you have until it's gone.
[03:16:44.769 --> 03:16:47.452]  We need to support free speech systems right now.
[03:16:47.452 --> 03:16:48.953]  So go check out the store.
[03:16:48.953 --> 03:16:50.134]  Go support their store.
[03:16:50.134 --> 03:16:51.656]  Go support InfoWars.

[03:16:53.017 --> 03:16:54.498]  Don't wait until they're gone!
[03:16:57.000 --> 03:17:03.404]  I have an extremely important message to all of my fellow InfoWarriors here in the United States and around the world.
[03:17:03.404 --> 03:17:08.027]  We are so excited to announce InfoWars MD.
[03:17:08.027 --> 03:17:10.829]  It turns out the top company in the U.S.
[03:17:10.829 --> 03:17:13.070]  for supplements is owned by a Patreon.
[03:17:13.070 --> 03:17:19.815]  And it turns out they're willing to give us deals that no one else is getting because they want to support InfoWars and keep us on the air.
[03:17:19.815 --> 03:17:23.197]  This deal has been a year in the making and finally the products are being brought to market.
[03:17:23.817 --> 03:17:34.501]  Up to 50% off what you get on top national brands that are the highest rated under the InfoWars label, InfoWars MD, exclusively at InfoWarsStore.com.

[03:17:51.847 --> 03:17:55.387]  This is the best deal out there and it keeps InfoWars on the air.
[03:17:55.387 --> 03:17:56.927]  InfoWarsMD.
[03:17:56.927 --> 03:18:09.430]  In the year 2000, Alex Jones' film Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove showed the world how our so-called elite leaders practice mock ritual sacrifices in private.
[03:18:12.258 --> 03:18:22.502]  In 2007, Alex Jones releases Endgame, exposing the world elite's plans for covertly using biological weapons against all of mankind.
[03:18:22.502 --> 03:18:34.326]  And by the time they launched their attack in 2020, Alex Jones' InfoWars and our audience were there to warn the people of the deadly vaccines that we knew were coming.
[03:18:34.326 --> 03:18:35.867]  This is why they attack us.
[03:18:36.347 --> 03:18:38.889]  This is why we need your support.
[03:18:38.889 --> 03:18:40.670]  Because we tell the truth.
[03:18:40.670 --> 03:18:42.872]  Alex Jones was right.
[03:18:42.872 --> 03:18:44.293]  Join the resistance.
[03:18:44.293 --> 03:18:45.614]  Buy products.
[03:18:45.614 --> 03:18:47.415]  Donate to the cause.
[03:18:47.415 --> 03:18:48.776]  Share the links.
[03:18:48.776 --> 03:18:51.198]  Join us in the fight for freedom.
[03:18:51.198 --> 03:18:53.400]  And help us defeat the New World Order.
[03:18:56.676 --> 03:19:09.195]  In the year 2000, Alex Jones' film Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove showed the world how our so-called elite leaders practice mock ritual sacrifices in private.
[03:19:12.006 --> 03:19:22.234]  In 2007, Alex Jones releases Endgame, exposing the world elite's plans for covertly using biological weapons against all of mankind.
[03:19:22.234 --> 03:19:34.084]  And by the time they launched their attack in 2020, Alex Jones' InfoWars and our audience were there to warn the people of the deadly vaccines that we knew were coming.
[03:19:34.084 --> 03:19:35.605]  This is why they attack us.
[03:19:36.085 --> 03:19:38.606]  This is why we need your support.
[03:19:38.606 --> 03:19:40.407]  Because we tell the truth.
[03:19:40.407 --> 03:19:42.608]  Alex Jones was right.
[03:19:42.608 --> 03:19:44.068]  Join the resistance.
[03:19:44.068 --> 03:19:45.349]  Buy products.
[03:19:45.349 --> 03:19:47.150]  Donate to the cause.
[03:19:47.150 --> 03:19:48.510]  Share the links.
[03:19:48.510 --> 03:19:50.931]  Join us in the fight for freedom.
[03:19:50.931 --> 03:19:58.194]  And help us defeat the New World Order.
[03:19:58.194 --> 03:20:02.816]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[03:20:02.816 --> 03:20:04.097]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:20:11.796 --> 03:20:16.140]  Back here with you on the Alex Jones Show, I'm Kate Dally, your guest host from katedallyradio.com.
[03:20:16.140 --> 03:20:19.563]  And my guest, Dr. Simone Gold, joins me.
[03:20:19.563 --> 03:20:34.737]  And let me just tell you, the hospitals, what's going on in California with all of the doctors, not just the hospitals, but all of the doctors, and whenever I see a bill in California or I see a bill in New York, just watch, because it takes about three years and the rest of the country usually gets it or grabs a hold of it.
[03:20:35.097 --> 03:20:40.954]  So we really ought to pay attention to what is happening in California to our doctors in California.
[03:20:40.954 --> 03:20:42.599]  Can you expand on this Dr. Gold?
[03:20:43.757 --> 03:20:44.938]  Yes, starting in January.
[03:20:44.938 --> 03:20:53.225]  This bill was winding its way, it's called AB 2098, and it was winding its way through California legislature, all of 22, and it became law on January 1st, 2023.
[03:20:53.225 --> 03:20:57.048]  And this bill outlaws doctors' second opinion.
[03:20:57.048 --> 03:20:58.950]  I'm sorry, but that's all it does.
[03:20:58.950 --> 03:21:07.497]  It says that if a doctor says things that disagree with the contemporary science, or some phrase like that, that that could threaten their license, which is really their livelihood.
[03:21:07.497 --> 03:21:08.718]  So let's break that down.
[03:21:08.718 --> 03:21:11.341]  First of all, it strips doctors, one particular group,
[03:21:11.721 --> 03:21:12.402]  We're good.
[03:21:24.728 --> 03:21:28.270]  Unbridgeable, unwaivable constitutional rights such as free speech.
[03:21:28.270 --> 03:21:29.170]  That's very dangerous.
[03:21:29.170 --> 03:21:32.372]  And then number two, the group that they're targeting is doctors.
[03:21:32.372 --> 03:21:38.134]  So doctors can no longer in California comfortably tell you what they think about, for example, COVID.
[03:21:38.134 --> 03:21:39.675]  They can't tell you early treatment.
[03:21:39.675 --> 03:21:41.356]  They can't tell you what they think about remdesivir.
[03:21:41.356 --> 03:21:44.637]  They can't do that or they might lose their license and their livelihood.
[03:21:44.637 --> 03:21:46.498]  It's incredibly extreme.
[03:21:46.498 --> 03:21:48.119]  It violates the first and 14th amendments.
[03:21:48.499 --> 03:21:51.463]  I do believe and hope it will be struck down.
[03:21:51.463 --> 03:22:00.173]  It's in a temporary injunction right now, but if this law stands, there's no exaggerating how severe an impact this will have.
[03:22:01.368 --> 03:22:03.450]  I can't imagine that kind of censorship.
[03:22:03.450 --> 03:22:05.712]  So basically, they're not doctors anymore.
[03:22:05.712 --> 03:22:20.483]  They are directed by the NIH, who directs then the administrations at the hospitals, to give them marching orders that were written by lawyers on how to prescribe and what to do with a patient, given a number system.
[03:22:20.483 --> 03:22:22.065]  Honestly, crazy!
[03:22:22.065 --> 03:22:23.906]  Let me be the first one to say this.
[03:22:23.906 --> 03:22:26.208]  They're robots, and they're killing robots.
[03:22:26.208 --> 03:22:29.931]  They're robots that will be deployed in service of a government
[03:22:30.848 --> 03:22:33.190]  Mandate, whatever that mandate might be.
[03:22:33.190 --> 03:22:39.353]  In the era of COVID, we saw Medicare policies that killed older Medicare recipients.
[03:22:39.353 --> 03:22:41.475]  Why wouldn't they deploy that going forward?
[03:22:43.447 --> 03:22:44.207]  They would.
[03:22:44.207 --> 03:22:44.648]  They would.
[03:22:44.648 --> 03:22:52.331]  And so people are so afraid to lose their job that they would absolutely go with the mandated protocol from the NIH in every instance.
[03:22:52.331 --> 03:23:02.515]  And those laws, there were laws changed in February of 2020, ironically, right before the mystery was named and the solution was already being manufactured, right?
[03:23:02.515 --> 03:23:03.376]  This vaccine.
[03:23:05.312 --> 03:23:09.533]  The way forward out of this is every person is going to have to advocate for themselves.
[03:23:09.533 --> 03:23:15.275]  And in some areas of life that are kind of complicated, you're going to need a smart advisor on your side who you can trust.
[03:23:15.275 --> 03:23:18.156]  That's the vision behind Goal Care.
[03:23:18.156 --> 03:23:20.336]  You're living in California and you can't move, right?
[03:23:20.336 --> 03:23:30.359]  And you know that your doctor in California maybe can't say what they need to say, then you need to go to GoalCare.com, become a member of our community, and talk to a doctor who can give you straightforward information.
[03:23:30.359 --> 03:23:33.040]  And then you can take that information and win your life.
[03:23:33.726 --> 03:23:35.969]  And that's really what it's going to have to be for people.
[03:23:35.969 --> 03:23:39.413]  Honestly, GoldCare.com is the best answer for people in California.
[03:23:40.692 --> 03:23:41.613]  Oh, absolutely.
[03:23:41.613 --> 03:23:43.675]  Because I think people hasn't registered yet.
[03:23:43.675 --> 03:23:47.177]  And it did for some like me that ended up in the hospital with a spouse.
[03:23:47.177 --> 03:23:51.141]  But it doesn't register for people that we are worse than Canada almost.
[03:23:51.141 --> 03:23:56.865]  We are at that point where socialized medicine has so infiltrated and the doctors aren't saying anything.
[03:23:56.865 --> 03:23:59.127]  Everybody still thinks, oh, that's just my nice doctor.
[03:23:59.127 --> 03:24:00.608]  Why would he lie to me?
[03:24:00.608 --> 03:24:01.429]  But you know what?
[03:24:01.429 --> 03:24:04.431]  And we talked about this in a previous interview too.
[03:24:04.431 --> 03:24:06.293]  The doctors going along with this.
[03:24:06.293 --> 03:24:08.535]  Why do they go along with this, Dr. Gold?
[03:24:08.535 --> 03:24:10.156]  Why do they just smile and do what they're told?
[03:24:11.349 --> 03:24:11.910]  It's both.
[03:24:11.910 --> 03:24:19.578]  It's both their employees are following their own financial interests and honestly it's disappointing how the lack of curiosity doctors had.
[03:24:19.578 --> 03:24:21.260]  It's just incredibly disappointing.
[03:24:21.260 --> 03:24:23.482]  This stuff is not easy, it's not hard to figure out.
[03:24:23.482 --> 03:24:27.126]  You can read the medical journals and I was not uniquely gifted.
[03:24:27.606 --> 03:24:29.328]  In my ability to read, you know what I mean?
[03:24:29.328 --> 03:24:32.730]  Like that was available to everyone, certainly all the doctors.
[03:24:32.730 --> 03:24:33.651]  You could read the journals.
[03:24:33.651 --> 03:24:35.633]  You could discover that early treatment didn't work.
[03:24:35.633 --> 03:24:40.657]  If you had read anything on public health in all of your years in medical school, you knew that masks didn't work.
[03:24:40.657 --> 03:24:42.798]  You knew that quarantining healthy people didn't work.
[03:24:42.798 --> 03:24:43.839]  This was all public health 101.
[03:24:43.839 --> 03:24:50.625]  So I'm saying we're entering a new era where people are going to have to advocate for themselves.
[03:24:50.625 --> 03:24:53.307]  And if you're just going to listen to other people, you're going to be in jeopardy.
[03:24:54.790 --> 03:24:55.170]  Oh, 100%.
[03:24:55.170 --> 03:25:08.302]  And as this bill sells through the other states, which I have a feeling they're going to try, those in California need to work really hard against this from happening so that it doesn't blanket the nation like it does with most bills.
[03:25:08.302 --> 03:25:11.244]  But also the fact that... Listen, let me... You can't listen to a doctor?
[03:25:11.244 --> 03:25:11.765]  Censorship?
[03:25:11.765 --> 03:25:14.387]  That is a... I don't even know what's worse.
[03:25:14.387 --> 03:25:15.448]  I mean, this is our health care.
[03:25:16.607 --> 03:25:17.708]  You know how bad this bill is?
[03:25:17.708 --> 03:25:21.630]  This bill is so bad that people on the right and on the left are agreeing.
[03:25:21.630 --> 03:25:26.714]  So America's Frontline Doctors is vehemently opposed to this bill and so is the ACLU.
[03:25:26.714 --> 03:25:28.535]  The ACLU is opposed to this bill.
[03:25:28.535 --> 03:25:30.396]  This is really bad news for Californians.
[03:25:30.396 --> 03:25:32.037]  They need to like really get up in arms.
[03:25:32.037 --> 03:25:34.359]  There's a couple of challenges to it now.
[03:25:34.359 --> 03:25:35.560]  This is really bad news.
[03:25:35.560 --> 03:25:38.302]  Other states, freedom states like Florida, are taking note of this.
[03:25:38.302 --> 03:25:38.562]  I think
[03:25:39.442 --> 03:25:44.687]  I think Florida, God willing, will put things in its constitution so this kind of challenge can never happen.
[03:25:44.687 --> 03:25:45.588]  But this is very important.
[03:25:45.588 --> 03:25:46.649]  Let's keep following this story.
[03:25:47.791 --> 03:25:48.412]  Absolutely.
[03:25:48.412 --> 03:25:50.533]  And it takes a lot of doctors, too, to follow along.
[03:25:50.533 --> 03:25:59.341]  If doctors would step out of this awful cycle and, you know, become part of places like GoldCare, that would be an amazing feat.
[03:25:59.341 --> 03:26:03.365]  Because in order to do this, they have to have a lot of willing soldiers in order to do that.
[03:26:03.365 --> 03:26:08.789]  So, and when I say soldiers, you know I mean doctors, but they need a lot of willing participants.
[03:26:08.789 --> 03:26:11.372]  And if doctors would have the courage to stand up and
[03:26:12.310 --> 03:26:13.732]  Be curious about what they're doing.
[03:26:30.732 --> 03:26:31.692]  Absolutely.
[03:26:31.692 --> 03:26:35.534]  And more and more people are questioning as we have more and more deaths from the shots.
[03:26:35.534 --> 03:26:37.675]  Not in the COVID year, but from the shots.
[03:26:37.675 --> 03:26:41.877]  And as they're even stupidly blaming COVID for the deaths from the shots.
[03:26:41.877 --> 03:26:44.138]  And, you know, will more information be coming out?
[03:26:44.138 --> 03:26:45.719]  What do you think, Dr. Gold?
[03:26:45.719 --> 03:26:47.199]  Will we get more and more and more?
[03:26:47.199 --> 03:26:48.400]  Will people finally realize?
[03:26:49.921 --> 03:26:52.443]  Honestly, there is an abundance of information already.
[03:26:52.443 --> 03:26:53.543]  It's just so suppressed.
[03:26:53.543 --> 03:26:58.386]  I mean, first of all, when you looked at the spike proteins, you knew it caused clotting, right?
[03:26:58.386 --> 03:27:02.548]  You knew it was challenging the immune system when you're putting this foreign body into your body.
[03:27:02.548 --> 03:27:03.889]  So, what a surprise!
[03:27:03.889 --> 03:27:06.710]  We're seeing clotting diseases and we're seeing immune dysfunction.
[03:27:06.710 --> 03:27:07.751]  So, the evidence is there.
[03:27:07.751 --> 03:27:11.013]  A lot of people are just like covering their eyes, you know, and they won't look at the evidence.
[03:27:11.013 --> 03:27:11.853]  But the evidence is there.
[03:27:13.536 --> 03:27:18.318]  You know what will happen though, to answer you in kind of a positive way, is that you won't need media to tell you this.
[03:27:18.318 --> 03:27:20.718]  People are actually experiencing it in their own lives.
[03:27:20.718 --> 03:27:32.782]  There's so many people who took the shots, who themselves experienced problems or knew someone who experienced problems, and almost everybody who took the shots knows someone who got sick or multiple times sick after the shot.
[03:27:32.782 --> 03:27:35.943]  So at the very least, they're on notice that the thing didn't work.
[03:27:35.943 --> 03:27:38.984]  So there's a lot of Americans who understand that the government lied to them.
[03:27:39.651 --> 03:27:44.214]  About the safe part and certainly about the lack of effective part.
[03:27:44.214 --> 03:27:44.995]  So that part's good.
[03:27:44.995 --> 03:27:48.977]  You know, you can't censor the stuff that's actually happening to you in your own life.
[03:27:48.977 --> 03:27:49.498]  Absolutely.
[03:27:49.498 --> 03:27:50.718]  And it's right in front of their face.
[03:27:50.718 --> 03:27:51.519]  Can't be ignored.
[03:27:51.519 --> 03:27:54.181]  And they weren't having these things happen in 2020.
[03:27:54.181 --> 03:28:01.786]  And so, my gosh, a cold does not cause blood clots and myocarditis, which used to be very, very rare.
[03:28:01.786 --> 03:28:03.887]  And I just appreciate all your efforts.
[03:28:03.887 --> 03:28:06.569]  Tell people where to go to get some help.
[03:28:07.955 --> 03:28:09.736]  Yes.
[03:28:09.736 --> 03:28:20.539]  You can go to my website, which is my name, drsimonegold.com, and please check out goldcare.com, which is on my website.
[03:28:20.539 --> 03:28:21.740]  It really is the solution.
[03:28:21.740 --> 03:28:25.741]  We have to start supporting those businesses that
[03:28:26.599 --> 03:28:35.964]  On our side of the aisle that want to promote freedom and want to promote your ability to defend yourself and your family and live healthy and free.
[03:28:35.964 --> 03:28:38.025]  So, GoldCare.com is the medical solution.
[03:28:38.025 --> 03:28:41.187]  There's other media solutions like InfoWars, etc.
[03:28:41.187 --> 03:28:43.969]  Please come to DrSimoneGold.com.
[03:28:43.969 --> 03:28:47.290]  Thank you, Dr. Gold, for joining me on the Alex Jones Show.
[03:28:47.290 --> 03:28:48.151]  I really appreciate it.
[03:28:48.151 --> 03:28:48.491]  Thank you.
[03:28:48.491 --> 03:28:50.012]  I'll be right back.
[03:28:50.012 --> 03:28:50.632]  Don't go anywhere.
[03:28:50.632 --> 03:28:51.893]  I want to talk to the Chinese balloon.

[03:30:35.060 --> 03:30:36.581]  This is a potential solution.
[03:30:36.581 --> 03:30:39.642]  Hydroxychloroquine comes from a natural substance.
[03:30:39.642 --> 03:30:42.563]  So does ivermectin, and now natokinase.
[03:30:42.563 --> 03:30:43.923]  Isn't it interesting?
[03:30:43.923 --> 03:30:50.086]  Natural substances, in a sense, combating this man-made disaster, SARS-CoV-2 and the vaccines.
[03:30:50.086 --> 03:30:54.527]  Onlinehealthnow.com, thank you for your support, and thank you for getting into that, because it's important.
[03:30:54.527 --> 03:30:56.548]  You didn't come here to do that, but I made you do it.
[03:30:56.548 --> 03:30:59.989]  The most banned man in America, Alex Jones.
[03:31:04.827 --> 03:31:06.168]  I want you all to know something.
[03:31:06.168 --> 03:31:08.129]  Alex Jones was right.
[03:31:08.129 --> 03:31:11.672]  Alex is right about far more than is wrong.
[03:31:11.672 --> 03:31:14.574]  Alex has been right on for over a decade.
[03:31:14.574 --> 03:31:19.057]  I don't care how you slice it, dice it, flip it up or rub it down.
[03:31:19.057 --> 03:31:21.259]  Alex Jones was right.
[03:31:21.259 --> 03:31:24.781]  Think about how frustrated we are if you've been awake for a year or two.
[03:31:24.781 --> 03:31:28.244]  Imagine being like an Alex Jones or those guys who've been awake for like decades.
[03:31:28.504 --> 03:31:31.386]  Alex Jones called this years ago.
[03:31:31.386 --> 03:31:32.407]  Years ago.
[03:31:32.407 --> 03:31:34.489]  Alex Jones never bought the Russia hoax.
[03:31:34.489 --> 03:31:36.470]  Not for a second.
[03:31:36.470 --> 03:31:38.992]  You are one of the great thinkers of this.
[03:31:38.992 --> 03:31:41.474]  You are a martyr to the First Amendment.
[03:31:41.474 --> 03:31:44.597]  The government fears Alex Jones.
[03:31:44.597 --> 03:31:46.158]  That's why the globalists hate me.
[03:31:46.158 --> 03:31:51.883]  It's because I'm exposing their corporate worldwide tyranny.
[03:31:51.883 --> 03:31:53.164]  AlexJonesLive.com
[03:31:56.772 --> 03:31:59.733]  Well, I just want to say about diet force.
[03:31:59.733 --> 03:32:01.573]  Diet force is amazing!
[03:32:01.573 --> 03:32:07.175]  I'm 45 and I have bits, I go to the gym and I have bits that won't move.
[03:32:07.175 --> 03:32:09.756]  And diet force has helped me move those bits.
[03:32:09.756 --> 03:32:16.117]  Like, under my pecs, my belly, I'm just taking diet force two calories a day.
[03:32:16.117 --> 03:32:18.318]  Man, if you're like struggling to get
[03:32:19.497 --> 03:32:21.778]  Like, chip shake for the ladies.
[03:32:21.778 --> 03:32:24.498]  Mate, DietForce is the go.
[03:32:24.498 --> 03:32:27.399]  You have to get the DietForce and have to a day.
[03:32:27.399 --> 03:32:29.159]  And just keep at it.

[03:33:13.055 --> 03:33:17.260]  I will get to the so-called Chinese balloon in just a moment.
[03:33:17.260 --> 03:33:20.804]  I asked Dr. Gold to come back because I failed to talk about it.
[03:33:20.804 --> 03:33:23.627]  I wanted to ask her about this lawsuit.
[03:33:23.627 --> 03:33:29.393]  People are wondering where we're going forward with the AFLDS, the American Frontline Doctors.
[03:33:29.393 --> 03:33:31.796]  Dr. Gold, thank you for joining me because
[03:33:32.436 --> 03:33:35.458]  The recent rumors, the allegations, the controversy.
[03:33:35.458 --> 03:33:39.640]  So many people went to American Frontline Doctors for help, got that help.
[03:33:39.640 --> 03:33:43.542]  It has been amazing in turning around the narrative of COVID.
[03:33:43.542 --> 03:33:45.183]  And so where does it stand now?
[03:33:45.183 --> 03:33:48.044]  What is going on right now?
[03:33:48.044 --> 03:33:48.784]  Thank you so much.
[03:33:48.784 --> 03:33:50.966]  Yes, I've been pretty badly defamed.
[03:33:50.966 --> 03:33:56.168]  I just ask for people to recognize I'm exactly who I've always been.
[03:33:56.168 --> 03:33:58.990]  Nobody does what I do and would do things that
[03:34:00.354 --> 03:34:01.515]  That were alleged against me.
[03:34:01.515 --> 03:34:05.837]  It just would be completely inconsistent with everything I've done in my life.
[03:34:05.837 --> 03:34:16.803]  But when I wanted to serve my prison sentence there, I had to make some adjustments on the board and there really became a disconnect and a misunderstanding between the board and myself as to the vision going forward.
[03:34:16.803 --> 03:34:18.464]  And it got pretty heated.
[03:34:18.464 --> 03:34:19.305]  I understand that.
[03:34:21.007 --> 03:34:24.392]  This forced litigation between the board and myself.
[03:34:24.392 --> 03:34:33.083]  And that litigation thus far, the judge has made a statement and the judge said that the board needs to come together with me and resolve the issue internally.
[03:34:33.083 --> 03:34:38.090]  And the judge recognized that AFL does cannot function, cannot survive without my leadership.
[03:34:38.630 --> 03:34:48.537]  So, I am calling on the board to heed the judge's advice, which is to meet together, to negotiate, to settle this thing and just move on, because AFL-JS has a lot of work to do.
[03:34:48.537 --> 03:34:58.523]  It has come to my attention that the real obstacle to these negotiated settlement with the board members is really the law firm Wagonmaker and Overly.
[03:34:58.523 --> 03:35:04.347]  Wagonmaker and Overly out of Chicago, they are the law firm representing some members of the board.
[03:35:04.887 --> 03:35:08.630]  And they are really standing in the way of a negotiation.
[03:35:08.630 --> 03:35:11.373]  I know that if we sit down, we'll be able to resolve our differences.
[03:35:11.373 --> 03:35:17.458]  But wagon-making overly is really standing in the way and it's very inappropriate for a law firm to do that.
[03:35:17.458 --> 03:35:23.063]  And I'm actually asking everyone who hears my voice, everyone who understands that America's Frontline Doctors has a big mission ahead of us.
[03:35:23.063 --> 03:35:24.905]  Medical tyranny is just like beating down on us.
[03:35:25.325 --> 03:35:28.687]  Please contact Wagonmaker and Oberle in Chicago.
[03:35:28.687 --> 03:35:33.530]  Sally Wagonmaker is standing in the way of us getting to a negotiated settlement.
[03:35:33.530 --> 03:35:35.672]  Dr. Gold, AFL-DS, and the board.
[03:35:35.672 --> 03:35:38.453]  And I appreciate the public's help in that.
[03:35:38.453 --> 03:35:39.074]  Wagonmaker.com.
[03:35:47.762 --> 03:35:53.284]  Absolutely help with this because you know frontline doctors, American frontline doctors stepped in when no one else would.
[03:35:53.284 --> 03:36:09.229]  They all risked their careers to do it and they didn't realize even how much they were risking at the time but they stuck with it and Dr. Simone Gold stuck with that and absolutely championed for the right to actual health care when the hospitals were basically killing people.
[03:36:09.229 --> 03:36:11.230]  So I really really appreciate that.
[03:36:11.230 --> 03:36:15.451]  A pandemic isn't a pandemic if the only people that die are in the ICU under an experimental drug.
[03:36:16.031 --> 03:36:23.175]  So, I love what you guys have done and I want you guys to continue that mission and I think you're right about that.
[03:36:23.175 --> 03:36:31.299]  Sometimes you get these lawyers that will stand in the way and do a lot of damage when things could be, I think, easily solved, right?
[03:36:32.908 --> 03:36:38.333]  America's Frontline Doctors is filled with the most ethical, most honorable, fiercest freedom warriors you can imagine.
[03:36:38.333 --> 03:36:40.214]  Brilliant scientists, brilliant doctors.
[03:36:40.214 --> 03:36:41.736]  We have thousands of us.
[03:36:41.736 --> 03:36:47.081]  All of that is being put at risk by this attorney law firm, Sally Wagonmaker.
[03:36:47.081 --> 03:36:57.931]  Wagonmakerlaw.com needs to hear from the public that she needs to not stand in the way of a negotiated settlement between Dr. Gold and the board.
[03:36:59.096 --> 03:37:00.457]  Yeah, thank you so much.
[03:37:00.457 --> 03:37:02.499]  Thanks for joining me, Dr. Simone Gold.
[03:37:02.499 --> 03:37:05.302]  I really appreciate you clearing that up because there's been a lot of controversy.
[03:37:05.302 --> 03:37:10.126]  People did not know where to turn in this controversy and so I really appreciate you.
[03:37:10.126 --> 03:37:10.887]  Thank you.
[03:37:10.887 --> 03:37:14.810]  I'm putting out a little bit of a documentary about this.
[03:37:14.810 --> 03:37:15.391]  Give me about a week.
[03:37:16.733 --> 03:37:17.894]  Oh good, I'm so glad.
[03:37:17.894 --> 03:37:28.038]  I'm really glad because I really like what you have done and I just like what you've done with health care and turning this whole narrative around.
[03:37:28.038 --> 03:37:32.260]  It has not been easy and you face a lot, even incarcerated, just for giving a speech.
[03:37:32.260 --> 03:37:35.962]  You were an invited guest, a speech on health care at the Capitol.
[03:37:35.962 --> 03:37:42.345]  So what they have done to you is just appalling and I appreciate all your efforts.
[03:37:42.345 --> 03:37:42.905]  I really do.
[03:37:42.905 --> 03:37:43.926]  Thank you so much.
[03:37:44.465 --> 03:37:44.905]  Thank you.
[03:37:44.905 --> 03:37:45.325]  You bet.
[03:37:45.325 --> 03:37:46.146]  Thanks for joining me.
[03:37:46.146 --> 03:37:48.106]  Thanks, Dr. Simone Gold.
[03:37:48.106 --> 03:37:52.868]  I want to also talk about this.
[03:37:52.868 --> 03:37:54.109]  I love what they're doing, by the way.
[03:37:54.109 --> 03:37:56.090]  Go to Gold Care, seriously.
[03:37:56.090 --> 03:37:57.670]  They're just doing a tremendous job.
[03:37:57.670 --> 03:38:03.873]  If it wasn't for doctors like Dr. Simone Gold, I would be a widow right now, and I can't fathom that.
[03:38:03.873 --> 03:38:06.534]  It makes me sick to my stomach, actually, to think about that.
[03:38:07.176 --> 03:38:11.101]  We've learned so much about the body and health and I think we're all experts now.
[03:38:11.101 --> 03:38:19.011]  I swear, I think we're all really, really aware about where health care is going in this nation and what we need to do to actually be
[03:38:21.331 --> 03:38:25.134]  I think very aware ourselves on what we need to do for the body.
[03:38:25.134 --> 03:38:26.115]  I've talked about copper.
[03:38:26.115 --> 03:38:27.256]  I've talked about parasites.
[03:38:27.256 --> 03:38:32.340]  There are so many things that doctors will not talk about with you and these doctors will.
[03:38:32.340 --> 03:38:36.023]  These doctors will bring up the most important parts of health care, your health.
[03:38:36.023 --> 03:38:39.647]  So I really appreciate Dr. Simone Gold and all of her efforts.
[03:38:39.647 --> 03:38:45.992]  Let's talk about the Chinese balloon because I want to share with you some research that I did, some really important research.
[03:38:46.867 --> 03:38:51.170]  Because it reminded me of this research that I talked about about four years ago.
[03:38:51.170 --> 03:38:53.031]  But, you know, of course it wasn't.
[03:38:53.031 --> 03:38:54.312]  I don't think it was Chinese.
[03:38:54.312 --> 03:38:58.195]  They wanted you to see it and they immediately blamed it on the Chinese.
[03:38:58.195 --> 03:39:06.681]  Which, you know, I love the meme that has the huge Chinese writing on it and it just says, gee, if we only had a clue about what it was.
[03:39:06.681 --> 03:39:07.601]  What did they do?
[03:39:07.601 --> 03:39:11.184]  Telescope in and it said, not spying on the maroon, you know?
[03:39:12.044 --> 03:39:18.350]  Anyway, so in the very beginning, I was very skeptical of the story.
[03:39:18.350 --> 03:39:22.653]  And then of course, as it sails through, and then it becomes a right-left paradigm.
[03:39:22.653 --> 03:39:27.117]  When it became a right-left paradigm, Biden, the administration, won't shoot it down.
[03:39:27.117 --> 03:39:29.499]  The fraudulent Coote administration won't shoot it down.
[03:39:29.499 --> 03:39:30.920]  And it became a left-right battle.
[03:39:30.920 --> 03:39:34.823]  I thought, we're in it even deeper because that is not what this is about.
[03:39:35.510 --> 03:39:38.011]  In fact, there were several things.
[03:39:38.011 --> 03:39:41.572]  They shot it down, didn't want to see what was in it, you know, that sort of thing.
[03:39:41.572 --> 03:39:43.753]  Absolutely asinine and ridiculous, right?
[03:39:43.753 --> 03:39:45.293]  And how did they know it was Chinese?
[03:39:45.293 --> 03:39:47.794]  I mean, it's just absolutely ridiculous.
[03:39:47.794 --> 03:39:49.994]  We are in bed with China.
[03:39:49.994 --> 03:40:01.478]  So even if at this point China goes, yeah, that was ours, it doesn't even matter at this point because to have something like that fly, be flying around when they have satellites to pick up things, they don't need a spying balloon.
[03:40:02.276 --> 03:40:04.097]  So, there were so many things, right?
[03:40:04.097 --> 03:40:10.039]  Too obvious, they wanted us to see it, and then I thought, you know, they want us to look weak.
[03:40:10.039 --> 03:40:17.181]  One of the big objectives, if you really look at the WEF, is the fact that they really want digital currency to come in.
[03:40:17.181 --> 03:40:18.281]  So, how do they do that?
[03:40:18.281 --> 03:40:20.482]  How do they do it effectively and get us to buy it?
[03:40:20.482 --> 03:40:26.444]  That there was some sort of hack that brings in our digital currency and hack in the banking system to throw everything off kilter, right?
[03:40:27.443 --> 03:40:29.631]  So they can provide a solution.
[03:40:29.631 --> 03:40:32.020]  And of course the solution is digital currency.
[03:40:32.943 --> 03:40:38.848]  So if they do this in May or June, which it's kind of rumored to be, then they have to make us look really weak.
[03:40:38.848 --> 03:40:44.152]  So they have to make it look like another country can fly a balloon and capture information, right?
[03:40:44.152 --> 03:40:51.177]  And they have to make it look like our airlines are being hacked and we have all these sudden problems coming.
[03:40:51.177 --> 03:40:58.583]  And lo and behold, after I said that, on Monday, the Pentagon came out and said, oh, we're just so weak.
[03:40:58.583 --> 03:41:01.305]  Oh my gosh, we just didn't see the undetectable.
[03:41:01.792 --> 03:41:08.078]  Honey, a cell phone in Montana could capture footage of a balloon in the sky.
[03:41:08.078 --> 03:41:09.579]  What do you mean undetectable?
[03:41:09.579 --> 03:41:11.541]  I mean, no one's actually believing that, right?
[03:41:11.541 --> 03:41:18.968]  But the Pentagon's so stupid, they would actually come out with an article that says, yo, we couldn't detect it with all of our, you know, satellites.
[03:41:18.968 --> 03:41:23.271]  And so basically, we're supposed to believe this horse crap.
[03:41:23.271 --> 03:41:27.075]  And then on top of it, they finally shoot it down, but over the ocean.
[03:41:27.788 --> 03:41:39.395]  It reminds me of when they really sort of fakely got Osama in 2012 to boost Obama's ratings for a second term, you know, to get elected again and then claim that they buried his body at sea.
[03:41:39.395 --> 03:41:40.816]  No one actually believes that either, right?
[03:41:40.816 --> 03:41:42.076]  I hope not.
[03:41:42.076 --> 03:41:44.318]  Anyway, so back to this balloon.
[03:41:44.318 --> 03:41:45.578]  They want us to look weak.
[03:41:45.578 --> 03:41:52.342]  They want us to look vulnerable so that when they do digital currency, they can see, see, we just didn't do enough to shore up our nation.
[03:41:52.342 --> 03:41:53.503]  We're so weak.
[03:41:53.503 --> 03:41:53.583]  Oh.
[03:41:54.266 --> 03:41:58.127]  And I think that's one of the components of this.
[03:41:58.127 --> 03:41:59.207]  It's going to be continuous.
[03:41:59.207 --> 03:42:02.227]  And this is why they let it fly and fly and fly and didn't say anything.
[03:42:02.227 --> 03:42:04.348]  And then, of course, they debated it.
[03:42:04.348 --> 03:42:11.509]  And then, of course, they waited by that time, you know, at the end of it to make sure they could shoot it down over the ocean so we could never see what was in it.
[03:42:11.509 --> 03:42:12.089]  Right.
[03:42:12.089 --> 03:42:13.029]  What a joke.
[03:42:13.029 --> 03:42:22.391]  But when I come back, I want to tell you about what they said in 2019, because it's really, really important to understand where we're at with this type of
[03:42:23.371 --> 03:42:28.794]  Balloon and that that balloon is very much ours.
[03:42:28.794 --> 03:42:32.156]  So I will come back and talk about that but looking vulnerable.
[03:42:32.156 --> 03:42:41.181]  Oh, yeah, they want us to look very vulnerable and they'll keep building the story just like the Pentagon did on Monday with their asinine statements of gee, we just couldn't see it.
[03:42:41.181 --> 03:42:45.223]  I know you guys could with your cell phone, but we couldn't so it's it's asinine, right?
[03:42:45.223 --> 03:42:46.043]  No one believes it.
[03:42:46.043 --> 03:42:48.725]  I would hope unless I don't know you're dumb as a door now.
[03:42:48.725 --> 03:42:50.486]  Anyway, we'll be right back.
[03:42:50.486 --> 03:42:52.187]  I'll be right back on the Alex Jones Show.
[03:42:52.187 --> 03:42:52.727]  Don't go anywhere.
[03:42:56.929 --> 03:42:59.311]  Cavalry has arrived.

[03:43:12.722 --> 03:43:15.003]  Everybody knows about grandma and chicken broth.
[03:43:15.003 --> 03:43:23.065]  Well, this is concentrated chicken broth, the strongest out there with chaga mushroom and a whole bunch of other ingredients like turmeric.

[03:43:31.328 --> 03:43:34.849]  If you've not experienced bone broth, even the regular ones have great effects.

[03:43:56.236 --> 03:43:59.778]  They want the planet for themselves, my friends.
[03:43:59.778 --> 03:44:02.419]  And we're so stupid, we let them kill us.
[03:44:02.419 --> 03:44:02.939]  We deserve it.
[03:44:05.221 --> 03:44:09.884]  Children don't deserve it, do they?
[03:44:09.884 --> 03:44:28.855]  And I looked and behold a pale horse and he that sat on the horse was named Death.
[03:44:28.855 --> 03:44:33.738]  Now the translation is I looked and behold a pale horse
[03:44:35.700 --> 03:44:39.564]  And his name that sat on him was death and hell followed with him.
[03:44:39.564 --> 03:44:43.708]  The book of Revelation.
[03:44:43.708 --> 03:44:45.369]  Very serious times to be alive, folks.
[03:44:45.369 --> 03:44:47.091]  They're not just doing this as a one-off.
[03:44:47.091 --> 03:44:48.652]  This is the beginning of the rest of our lives.
[03:44:48.652 --> 03:44:50.014]  This is our fight.
[03:44:50.014 --> 03:44:51.375]  And I'm proud of humanity.
[03:44:51.375 --> 03:44:52.816]  The globalists even admit it's leaked.
[03:44:52.816 --> 03:44:56.480]  They're very upset that they're losing and that this hasn't gone the way they thought it would.
[03:44:58.007 --> 03:45:01.129]  I talk a lot about the great successes InfoWars has had.
[03:45:01.129 --> 03:45:03.410]  I don't think anybody can deny it.
[03:45:03.410 --> 03:45:07.352]  And it is because of listeners and viewers supporting us.
[03:45:07.352 --> 03:45:16.277]  When we talk about the crew at InfoWars, people behind the scenes, the researchers, the writers, they really have been the MVPs in this fight.
[03:45:16.277 --> 03:45:24.082]  And when you look at Harrison Smith and Owen Schroer and the hard work they engage in every day, five, six, seven days a week, it's really just incredible.
[03:45:25.094 --> 03:45:27.976]  So for myself and the whole InfoWars crew, I thank you for your past support.
[03:45:27.976 --> 03:45:34.519]  I only encourage you now to realize that InfoWars cannot stay on air if you do not support us.
[03:45:34.519 --> 03:45:37.561]  I know you spread the word, I know you pray for us, and that's wonderful, keep doing it.
[03:45:37.561 --> 03:45:45.786]  But most viewers and listeners, never go to InfoWarsStore.com, and you never buy great products that enrich and empower your life, while at the same time keeping us on air.
[03:45:46.506 --> 03:45:50.810]  I know that less than 1% of our listeners actually go buy products at ForrestWare.com.
[03:45:50.810 --> 03:45:55.735]  If just 1% more of you took action and went to ForrestWare.com, our funding problems will be over.
[03:45:55.735 --> 03:45:56.816]  Please take action now.
[03:45:56.816 --> 03:46:09.288]  In the year 2000, Alex Jones' film, Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove, showed the world how our so-called elite leaders practice mock ritual sacrifices in private.
[03:46:12.526 --> 03:46:22.352]  In 2007, Alex Jones releases Endgame, exposing the world elite's plans for covertly using biological weapons against all of mankind.
[03:46:22.352 --> 03:46:34.180]  And by the time they launched their attack in 2020, Alex Jones' InfoWars and our audience were there to warn the people of the deadly vaccines that we knew were coming.
[03:46:34.180 --> 03:46:35.721]  This is why they attack us.
[03:46:36.201 --> 03:46:38.722]  This is why we need your support.
[03:46:38.722 --> 03:46:40.523]  Because we tell the truth.
[03:46:40.523 --> 03:46:42.724]  Alex Jones was right.
[03:46:42.724 --> 03:46:44.164]  Join the resistance.
[03:46:44.164 --> 03:46:45.465]  Buy products.
[03:46:45.465 --> 03:46:47.265]  Donate to the cause.
[03:46:47.265 --> 03:46:48.626]  Share the links.
[03:46:48.626 --> 03:46:51.047]  Join us in the fight for freedom.
[03:46:51.047 --> 03:46:59.170]  And help us defeat the New World Order.
[03:46:59.170 --> 03:47:03.791]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[03:47:03.791 --> 03:47:05.052]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:47:12.012 --> 03:47:13.294]  Back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:13.294 --> 03:47:14.075]  So happy to be here.
[03:47:14.075 --> 03:47:17.861]  I'm Kate Daly, your guest host from katedalyradio.com.
[03:47:17.861 --> 03:47:18.843]  All right, a couple of things.
[03:47:18.843 --> 03:47:20.625]  Let's go nuts and bolts here.
[03:47:20.625 --> 03:47:22.628]  As far as research goes,
[03:47:23.510 --> 03:47:32.532]  When they were blaming it on China right away, it reminded me of 9-11 when they immediately knew exactly who did it within about three seconds.
[03:47:32.532 --> 03:47:34.472]  That always cracks me up when they do that.
[03:47:34.472 --> 03:47:36.712]  No investigation necessary.
[03:47:36.712 --> 03:47:44.114]  And of course they didn't blame it on Russia, which would have made more sense right now with the money laundering going on in Ukraine and then of course the whole Russia tale.
[03:47:44.114 --> 03:47:45.874]  So that would have actually made more sense.
[03:47:45.874 --> 03:47:48.054]  But of course not.
[03:47:48.054 --> 03:47:49.234]  They had to blame it on China.
[03:47:49.234 --> 03:47:52.475]  So making us look weak from different angles, different countries,
[03:47:53.098 --> 03:47:54.439]  That makes sense to me.
[03:47:54.439 --> 03:47:56.941]  Same reason they blamed the whole China disease.
[03:47:56.941 --> 03:47:57.902]  I don't believe that.
[03:47:57.902 --> 03:47:59.083]  I actually don't believe that.
[03:47:59.083 --> 03:48:07.590]  We were so in bed with China, coordinated the efforts with COVID, used them as a scapegoat so that we could actually say, oh, it was done in China, so it's a China.
[03:48:07.590 --> 03:48:08.992]  China wanted to get back at us.
[03:48:08.992 --> 03:48:10.333]  China wanted to do this to us.
[03:48:10.333 --> 03:48:11.554]  I don't believe that for a hot minute.
[03:48:11.954 --> 03:48:27.746]  I believe that the CDC was at the helm the entire time and I believe that to carry it out, they just used their little station over in China to actually start it and have a starting point that was not the USA.
[03:48:27.746 --> 03:48:28.347]  That's what I believe.
[03:48:29.284 --> 03:48:33.405]  Um, so, uh, when I was looking back at some research, it was interesting.
[03:48:33.405 --> 03:48:39.186]  2019, I covered a story, Persistent Surveillance Systems by Lockheed Martin.
[03:48:39.186 --> 03:48:44.307]  In 2019, they came out with the Southern Border Tethered Aerostat Radar System, TARS.
[03:48:44.307 --> 03:48:47.728]  All TARS were equipped and integrated, of course, with Lockheed Martin.
[03:48:47.728 --> 03:48:48.928]  They just, they're the government.
[03:48:48.928 --> 03:48:50.729]  I mean, obviously we know that, right?
[03:48:50.729 --> 03:48:51.849]  They're not a separate entity.
[03:48:51.849 --> 03:48:52.949]  They just work for the government.
[03:48:52.949 --> 03:48:56.530]  So, they're L88 Wide Area Surveillance Radar.
[03:48:57.225 --> 03:49:18.233]  And they said it was the largest aerostat system in daily operation in the United States, and that this system used helium for deployment as heights for 10 to 12,000 feet, and it allowed long-range radars to overcome the line-of-sight constraints caused by the curvature of the earth and other terrain limitations, their words.
[03:49:18.996 --> 03:49:29.634]  The Aerostats were tethered to a winch system and what had happened was they basically began the Aerostat program in 1978 and then the U.S.
[03:49:29.634 --> 03:49:31.017]  Air Force expanded it in the 80s.
[03:49:32.173 --> 03:49:35.956]  So that probably means it happened way earlier because you know how they lie.
[03:49:35.956 --> 03:49:40.340]  But they provided monitoring capabilities to several federal agencies.
[03:49:40.340 --> 03:49:41.060]  Monitoring.
[03:49:41.060 --> 03:49:41.861]  That's what they called it.
[03:49:41.861 --> 03:49:42.341]  Yeah.
[03:49:42.341 --> 03:49:44.063]  That's just straight up spying.
[03:49:44.063 --> 03:49:48.086]  And so in 2013, they went even with more operations.
[03:49:48.086 --> 03:49:55.352]  And then, of course, in 2019, you know, basically just put it on steroids.
[03:49:56.044 --> 03:50:04.489]  And so I think it's our system and it's part of a global system of especially in the Five Eyes system, the five countries that we're a part of.
[03:50:04.489 --> 03:50:08.731]  And I think it's just basically gathering data.
[03:50:08.731 --> 03:50:15.975]  It's gathering data and they had to blame it on something else because that storyline works to make us look very, very weak.
[03:50:15.975 --> 03:50:18.117]  That's what I think.
[03:50:18.117 --> 03:50:20.498]  And so, of course, they just had to name it the Chinese thing.
[03:50:21.181 --> 03:50:29.927]  So in 2019, if you can go Google this, the Pentagon came out and were talking about their surveillance systems and how much they wanted to ramp it up.
[03:50:29.927 --> 03:50:31.849]  Basically.
[03:50:31.849 --> 03:50:32.990]  And they did, didn't they?
[03:50:32.990 --> 03:50:34.411]  And we're going to see more of them.
[03:50:34.411 --> 03:50:36.052]  I'll probably blame them on other countries.
[03:50:36.052 --> 03:50:37.032]  Who knows?
[03:50:37.032 --> 03:50:38.994]  But here's the thing.
[03:50:38.994 --> 03:50:42.596]  There's a couple of things that I want you to know about that are important right now.
[03:50:42.596 --> 03:50:47.320]  And there's social media bills being represented in legislatures across the country.
[03:50:47.887 --> 03:50:50.429]  These social media bills are really dangerous.
[03:50:50.429 --> 03:50:53.571]  I know that nationally they're trying to do this as well.
[03:50:53.571 --> 03:51:00.396]  The social media bills, what people don't understand about the social media thing with kids and keeping kids from cell phones in the classroom.
[03:51:00.396 --> 03:51:02.938]  Now, as a parent, you probably go, yeah, that's a really good idea.
[03:51:02.938 --> 03:51:08.262]  I would think so too, except for the fact that they're really pushing this hard, right?
[03:51:08.262 --> 03:51:11.664]  Lots of focus on TikTok all of a sudden by our government.
[03:51:11.664 --> 03:51:15.707]  Why is our government so overwhelmed by TikTok?
[03:51:16.323 --> 03:51:17.404]  There's a reason.
[03:51:17.404 --> 03:51:24.008]  And the kid that was on the bus beating up the little girl, whoever raised that kid, oh my gosh.
[03:51:24.008 --> 03:51:27.731]  Anyway, it was horrifying to watch that, right?
[03:51:27.731 --> 03:51:30.073]  And what did the school district come out and say?
[03:51:30.073 --> 03:51:31.754]  Ooh, their use of social media.
[03:51:31.754 --> 03:51:36.537]  They weren't really condemning the attack, the assault, as much as they were people filming it.
[03:51:36.537 --> 03:51:39.159]  Which, of course, you don't want to see people film like that.
[03:51:39.159 --> 03:51:40.720]  I mean, they didn't step in to help.
[03:51:40.720 --> 03:51:44.803]  These other kids, I guess, weren't parented very well and didn't step in to help the little girl.
[03:51:45.413 --> 03:51:50.315]  But at the same time, there was a focus by the school district that I haven't seen before.
[03:51:50.315 --> 03:51:54.857]  They weren't saying zero tolerance like they usually do, which is an asinine statement.
[03:51:54.857 --> 03:51:58.859]  What they were saying was, well, you know, kids and their social media.
[03:51:58.859 --> 03:52:04.101]  So there's a lot of focus on getting this social media bills passed in all the states and also federally.
[03:52:04.821 --> 03:52:07.163]  What it does is it robs your Fourth Amendment.
[03:52:07.163 --> 03:52:22.894]  It takes away your Fourth Amendment because you have to provide so much information on your child in order for the government to step in as the nanny, the parent, the baby daddy, and absolutely control the situation where kids could not have it in the public school system.
[03:52:22.894 --> 03:52:25.316]  So there's such an element of control here.
[03:52:25.316 --> 03:52:27.397]  It's how they carry it out.
[03:52:27.397 --> 03:52:28.338]  It's how they do it.
[03:52:29.108 --> 03:52:38.591]  That is absolutely appalling when it comes to violations of privacy and collecting even more data on you, your family, and your child.
[03:52:38.591 --> 03:52:40.451]  That's what's horrific about it.
[03:52:40.451 --> 03:52:44.132]  And as it's sailing through the states, you really need to stop this.
[03:52:44.132 --> 03:52:45.833]  They have enough information on our kids.
[03:52:45.833 --> 03:52:48.734]  They're already selling Common Core information.
[03:52:48.734 --> 03:52:52.135]  They've been doing this for years and years and years, the data on your kids.
[03:52:53.507 --> 03:53:00.416]  We have to be able to understand that the fallout of that bill is government, government, government control.
[03:53:00.416 --> 03:53:05.922]  And you do not want the government to be the baby daddy, to be the nanny in this case.
[03:53:05.922 --> 03:53:09.847]  The government loves to come in and solve a problem, and we have way too much government.
[03:53:09.847 --> 03:53:11.049]  It's very tyrannical.
[03:53:11.049 --> 03:53:12.070]  I don't need to tell you that.
[03:53:12.677 --> 03:53:21.679]  But we are living in such a state of tyranny that to hand over more tyranny because an idea sounds nice, that's what the leftists do.
[03:53:21.679 --> 03:53:23.059]  This idea sounds good.
[03:53:23.059 --> 03:53:24.920]  Emotionally, I'm on board.
[03:53:24.920 --> 03:53:26.780]  They don't even care about rights.
[03:53:26.780 --> 03:53:32.061]  They do not care that the Constitution is being violated in any way, shape, or form if it sounds good.
[03:53:32.061 --> 03:53:34.462]  But that's about the intelligence of a leftist.
[03:53:34.462 --> 03:53:35.602]  They don't understand.
[03:53:36.272 --> 03:53:38.375]  On the right, we have the same problem.
[03:53:38.375 --> 03:53:43.722]  We have good intentions, but we have the same problem in saying, when is government too much government?
[03:53:43.722 --> 03:53:45.385]  What are we doing here?
[03:53:45.385 --> 03:53:47.087]  And obviously, not right.
[03:53:47.087 --> 03:53:52.575]  On many, many accounts, please fight these social media bills because of the invasion of the Fourth Amendment.
[03:53:53.055 --> 03:53:55.837]  We already have too much NSA spying.
[03:53:55.837 --> 03:53:58.218]  We already have too much data being collected.
[03:53:58.218 --> 03:54:01.560]  Don't hand them over more because an idea sounds good.
[03:54:01.560 --> 03:54:10.345]  We just need really good parenting that says, honey, you're not taking your phone to school or stay off your phone in the classroom or whatever the case may be.
[03:54:10.345 --> 03:54:11.566]  We need good parents.
[03:54:11.566 --> 03:54:12.166]  That's what we need.
[03:54:12.972 --> 03:54:24.082]  The other thing I wanted to tell you about really quick was I talked with Susan Schwartz who is over at Right to Life League, the longest running pro-life legal group and they're awesome.
[03:54:24.082 --> 03:54:25.703]  They're in California.
[03:54:25.703 --> 03:54:26.344]  And let me tell you,
[03:54:27.134 --> 03:54:32.497]  What this administration, this fraudulent King Fraudelot administration, by the way, he does look like a droid.
[03:54:32.497 --> 03:54:44.763]  Anyway, this administration is basically what they're doing is allowing for chemical drugs to be dispersed at the pharmacy level without ever having to see a doctor.
[03:54:44.763 --> 03:54:55.708]  Usually, if a woman wants to murder her baby, you actually have to go into the clinic and you have to be seen by somebody to actually get the gestation of that baby because you can't be given those drugs
[03:54:56.048 --> 03:54:57.029]  Thank you so much.
[03:55:14.670 --> 03:55:28.544]  But the case is, is they actually have it easier right now because they can, because of COVID, they said all you have to do is basically drive through your pharmacy window, grab your chemical drugs because the pharmacies are now allowed to write the scripts for those.
[03:55:28.544 --> 03:55:31.186]  The pharmacy doesn't even have to look at you.
[03:55:31.186 --> 03:55:35.371]  You can claim, oh, I'm nine weeks because over 10 weeks there's a problem.
[03:55:35.371 --> 03:55:36.131]  I'm eight weeks.
[03:55:36.131 --> 03:55:36.752]  I'm nine weeks.
[03:55:37.152 --> 03:55:38.974]  And a doctor never even looks at you.
[03:55:38.974 --> 03:55:40.615]  So women actually have it easier.
[03:55:40.615 --> 03:55:46.159]  So don't buy the whole, you know, story about we can't murder our babies now, woe is us.
[03:55:46.159 --> 03:55:51.142]  Like Amy Schumer and her asinine commercial, come to Colorado so you can murder your baby.
[03:55:51.142 --> 03:55:52.083]  That kind of thing.
[03:55:52.083 --> 03:55:53.564]  Don't buy into it.
[03:55:53.564 --> 03:55:58.568]  It's a total lie because they actually just made it easier to do, which is really pathetic and evil.
[03:55:59.272 --> 03:56:08.137]  The Satanic Temple, of course, the big fight in the lawsuits about the Satanic Temple wanting to perform abortions.
[03:56:08.137 --> 03:56:10.858]  It's quite actually funny that they're trying to do this.
[03:56:10.858 --> 03:56:14.940]  My idea is that we only allow abortions in Satanic Temples.
[03:56:14.940 --> 03:56:20.263]  That way, as the girl walks in, they actually get to see what they're a part of.
[03:56:20.623 --> 03:56:26.087]  And if you have to go to a satanic temple to get an abortion, maybe you might rethink it, right?
[03:56:26.087 --> 03:56:40.759]  But this satanic temple that pretends to be a religion is fighting and fighting and fighting with the most asinine attorneys you've ever met who don't know what they're doing, thank goodness, to try to get abortions done at these satanic temples.
[03:56:40.759 --> 03:56:44.942]  But you know, if you're a girl that has to walk into a satanic temple to do this,
[03:56:45.834 --> 03:56:50.517]  I sure hope the idea hits home that what you're doing just might be a little evil.
[03:56:50.517 --> 03:56:51.518]  You think?
[03:56:51.518 --> 03:57:03.287]  Anyway, I just wanted to let everybody know what's going on in our pharmacies because I don't think people realize this and I thought this was great information coming out of Right to Life League and they're trying to fight this.
[03:57:03.287 --> 03:57:04.768]  You can fight this in your state.
[03:57:04.768 --> 03:57:14.435]  DeSantis is fighting this in Florida and so I know my own state probably won't because we're weak and we have a despicable governor but I know that many states will.
[03:57:15.455 --> 03:57:26.039]  Not lick the Biden boots and basically make sure that they are not making it even easier to have these abortions by just going to your local pharmacy and getting it done.
[03:57:26.039 --> 03:57:27.340]  It just makes you sick, doesn't it?
[03:57:27.340 --> 03:57:34.702]  I hate to end on that, but there's just so many things to be aware of right now that are happening and that we're just straight-up lied to about.
[03:57:34.702 --> 03:57:36.183]  I know you know that.
[03:57:36.183 --> 03:57:37.983]  But I'm so grateful to spend this hour with you.
[03:57:37.983 --> 03:57:41.465]  Big thank you to Dr. Simone Gold and thank you for tuning into the Alex Jones Show.
[03:57:41.465 --> 03:57:42.425]  Really appreciate you guys.
[03:57:47.310 --> 03:57:50.352]  InfoWars' secret weapon is finally here.
[03:57:50.352 --> 03:57:58.719]  It's a secret weapon for your immune system, for your stamina, for your energy, for your way of life, for your libido, and it also keeps InfoWars on the air.
[03:57:58.719 --> 03:58:08.266]  And I almost forgot, you save at least 50% on these products for what you pay for similar products or the exact same products in stores around the country.
[03:58:08.266 --> 03:58:13.711]  That's because we go right to the highest quality manufacturer in the nation that supplies some of the top names.
[03:58:13.711 --> 03:58:16.433]  They then give us the best deal out there, because the owner's a listener,
[03:58:16.653 --> 03:58:19.075]  We're able to bring it to you with massive discounts.
[03:58:19.075 --> 03:58:24.259]  You're not going to find 1,000 mg high quality CBD for anywhere near the price we sell it.
[03:58:24.259 --> 03:58:26.641]  You're not going to find it at the 10 mg or the 20 mg.
[03:58:26.641 --> 03:58:30.405]  You're not going to find turmeric at 95% humanoid at the price we're selling it.
[03:58:30.405 --> 03:58:33.067]  You're not going to find any of this anywhere near that.
[03:58:33.067 --> 03:58:39.172]  These similar formulas or the same formulas sell for up to 200% more than we're selling these.
[03:58:39.172 --> 03:58:43.556]  InfoWars MD, now available exclusively at InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:58:43.556 --> 03:58:44.256]  A true 360 win.
[03:58:47.088 --> 03:58:59.744]  Mark Twain, one of America's greatest writers and satirists and minds, famously said more than 150 years ago, rumors of his demise had been greatly exaggerated.
[03:58:59.744 --> 03:59:02.948]  Because the newspapers kept saying he died decades before he did die.
[03:59:03.729 --> 03:59:06.031]  And it's the same PSYOP today.
[03:59:06.031 --> 03:59:13.597]  InfoWars is more influential and more powerful than ever because of your support and because the facts that we've covered is coming true.
[03:59:13.597 --> 03:59:22.445]  But if they can convince you we've been shut down, if they can convince you that we're going away, and you stop supporting, you stop spreading the word, then they do win.
[03:59:22.445 --> 03:59:28.110]  Ladies and gentlemen, there's only one group of people that can shut down InfoWars, and that's you, the viewers and listeners.
[03:59:28.610 --> 03:59:30.552]  If you decide we're done, we're done.
[03:59:30.552 --> 03:59:37.818]  If you decide to go to InfoWarsTore.com and get supplements and books and films and t-shirts and so much more, we will stay on the air indefinitely.
[03:59:37.818 --> 03:59:39.239]  It is all in your hands.
[03:59:39.239 --> 03:59:40.580]  So thanks for your support.
[03:59:40.580 --> 03:59:41.781]  Stand up against the globalists.
[03:59:41.781 --> 03:59:45.063]  Go to InfoWarsTore.com right now and keep us on air.
[03:59:45.063 --> 03:59:48.246]  It's up to you.
[03:59:48.246 --> 03:59:54.151]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
