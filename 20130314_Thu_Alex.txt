[00:00.000 --> 00:12.320]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does
[00:12.320 --> 00:21.080]  he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:21.080 --> 00:46.440]  It's already, wow, hard to believe it, Thursday, the 14th day of March, 2013. And I've been
[00:46.440 --> 00:50.680]  kind of hogging the broadcast the last few days, barely opening the phones up. We did
[00:50.680 --> 00:54.280]  take some calls yesterday with George Norie. I want to open the phones up for listeners
[00:54.280 --> 00:59.240]  to talk about the incredible breaking news that we didn't predict it.
[00:59.240 --> 01:02.900]  But we were the first to break it in government documents that they would then just announce
[01:02.900 --> 01:09.680]  being white would be an act of terrorism to create racial division. I mean, right now,
[01:09.680 --> 01:16.780]  the white supremacist roles and things are just swelling to record numbers. Just like
[01:16.780 --> 01:20.120]  if they put you in prison and you're white or you're Hispanic or you're black, you better
[01:20.120 --> 01:24.920]  go be part of that gang cuz that's how they house you in the wings of the prison.
[01:24.920 --> 01:31.600]  They're just not a choice. The system forces you into it. Really a masterstroke, LA Times
[01:31.600 --> 01:36.560]  and others regurgitating, one with MSNBC, the new Justice Department report put out
[01:36.560 --> 01:42.540]  by their private intelligence army, the Southern Poverty Law Center, their Merck group, saying
[01:42.540 --> 01:49.680]  being white is inherently racist and evil and terrorist. I'm not joking. And now they've
[01:49.680 --> 01:55.120]  got universities and groups, if you want to basically get your tuition or get your scholarship,
[01:55.120 --> 01:59.800]  you've got to sign on to agree to go under Southern Poverty Law Center written manuals.
[01:59.800 --> 02:05.160]  And Aaron Dykes covered this last night. I'm gonna have him in today. With their actual
[02:05.160 --> 02:12.300]  printouts in Wisconsin and other states, whites are to wear a white armband or wristband like
[02:12.300 --> 02:15.640]  Jews wearing yellow stars to show your evil.
[02:15.640 --> 02:19.840]  And then you, quote, have a minority who is really the majority worldwide and are the
[02:19.840 --> 02:25.000]  majority in the US, follow you around and tell you how bad you are. It actually says
[02:25.000 --> 02:31.400]  that. America is a giant reeducation camp. And again, it's about divide and conquer.
[02:31.400 --> 02:36.600]  It's the government dividing and conquering and putting billboards up saying my people
[02:36.600 --> 02:41.640]  rise up in Spanish, Mexican flag. And then kids can't wear American flags in school cuz
[02:41.640 --> 02:46.760]  it's racist. It's total control to say, give me government-run health care, give me gun
[02:46.760 --> 02:49.120]  control, you're a racist.
[02:49.120 --> 02:53.960]  You're like, what's that have to do with it? Racist, it's just a political tool. See, they
[02:53.960 --> 02:58.080]  get you to be politically correct and feel all guilty. I'm not guilty of jack squat,
[02:58.080 --> 03:04.360]  I'm 39 years old. I grew up in Dallas, Texas. My parents were what you'd call paleo-conservatives,
[03:04.360 --> 03:07.760]  you'd call them liberals today. But the mainline liberal's really a tyrant, so you wouldn't
[03:07.760 --> 03:08.840]  call them liberals.
[03:08.840 --> 03:12.380]  But I was really brought up to be, it's the character of someone's deeds and what they
[03:12.380 --> 03:18.080]  stand for. And I was sophisticated enough to not buy into being forced into race-based
[03:18.080 --> 03:22.880]  politics, but that's the tool. They want you in the big city model, whether it's the black
[03:22.880 --> 03:27.220]  neighborhood, the Hispanic neighborhood, the white neighborhood, the rich white neighborhood,
[03:27.220 --> 03:28.840]  the rich black neighborhood.
[03:28.840 --> 03:33.340]  It's also a class system. And then they play that and use communism as the only solution
[03:33.340 --> 03:36.360]  to get out of it. And then have the media push that, well, that's how you can get out
[03:36.360 --> 03:40.360]  of it, is a collectivization that's run by the globalists that are offshore. I mean,
[03:40.360 --> 03:43.600]  was Che Guevara a guy with a lot of courage?
[03:43.600 --> 03:47.840]  Was he a really interesting person? Yeah, but did he kill tens of thousands of innocent
[03:47.840 --> 03:52.600]  people personally and enjoy it? To the point of Fidel Castro throwing him out of the country,
[03:52.600 --> 03:57.360]  and Africa throwing him out, and the Soviets throwing him out, and the Bolivian communists
[03:57.360 --> 03:58.760]  throwing him out?
[03:58.760 --> 04:04.360]  Yeah, that's the point. I mean, can I say Hitler had a lot of courage. I mean, he had
[04:04.360 --> 04:11.540]  a Congressional Medal of Honor. That was the equivalent. He had the Iron Cross first class.
[04:11.540 --> 04:15.240]  That's the Congressional Medal of Honor. They only handed out a handful of those in World
[04:15.240 --> 04:21.480]  War I. That's why everybody followed Hitler, cuz he was a big war hero.
[04:21.480 --> 04:25.800]  And the point was, was he a real person who thought he was doing good? Yeah, but was he
[04:25.800 --> 04:30.620]  twisted and evil? Absolutely. Well, wait a minute, you don't like the New World Order
[04:30.620 --> 04:36.400]  and the mega banks, but you don't like Hugo Chavez. Hugo Chavez has like $5 billion of
[04:36.400 --> 04:38.520]  gold, $2 billion in cash.
[04:38.520 --> 04:45.400]  I know people who had their small businesses taken by. See, the mega rich want collectivization.
[04:45.400 --> 04:49.800]  So see, I didn't like Pinochet, a right winger, and I didn't like a so-called left winger
[04:49.800 --> 04:54.660]  like Che Guevara or a fascist like Hitler. I don't like tyrants, and I'm gonna explain
[04:54.660 --> 05:02.700]  that with all the big news and our guests coming up when we come back. Stay with us.

[08:04.080 --> 08:21.040]  the lies and disinformation. It's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. Ladies and gentlemen
[08:21.040 --> 08:26.280]  coming up in studio, he did a special report on the nightly news about it last night. Aaron
[08:26.280 --> 08:33.400]  Dykes is joining us. Universities all over the United States are telling whites that
[08:33.400 --> 08:38.440]  they're inherently evil and bad and making them wear white armbands to symbolize that
[08:38.440 --> 08:47.080]  they're bad and having them agree under AmeriCorps and they have to agree then to get their tuition
[08:47.080 --> 08:53.440]  to be followed, quote, by a minority to explain to them how inherently bad it is to be white.
[08:53.440 --> 08:58.400]  Now again, ladies and gentlemen, this is all run by big offshore mega banks who divide
[08:58.400 --> 09:04.040]  and conquer. The Romans were experts, said it. The British Empire was experts. African
[09:04.040 --> 09:09.120]  kings have been experts. If you're an authoritarian, you're an expert at divide and conquer. And
[09:09.120 --> 09:15.840]  now as the mega banks are sucking us dry imploding the dollar, pumping $85 billion a month into
[09:15.840 --> 09:22.640]  foreign banks, your taxpayer money that you have to even pay interest on, you bail out
[09:22.640 --> 09:24.440]  the banks and then pay them interest.
[09:24.440 --> 09:28.520]  They do this everywhere. They go in, they have sociologists, anthropologists, it's what
[09:28.520 --> 09:38.560]  intelligence agencies do, just look it up. And they bring in a system to absolutely break
[09:38.560 --> 09:45.520]  down as much of the society as they can so that everyone's fighting with each other.
[09:45.520 --> 09:51.400]  And then it creates real tribal division. Racism doesn't really exist. It's called tribalism.
[09:51.400 --> 09:54.640]  That's why you'll have one group of white tribes next to each other that hate each other
[09:54.640 --> 09:58.340]  and kill each other. And then the Romans could show up from a different culture and group
[09:58.340 --> 10:01.040]  and one tribe would team up with them to kill the other.
[10:01.040 --> 10:06.900]  Same thing with the UN showing up with white Belgian soldiers in the Congo and half the
[10:06.900 --> 10:10.840]  tribes begging them to kill the other half or Native Americans. Humans are just humans.
[10:10.840 --> 10:16.680]  We act the same way. And in a primitive sense, this was 2,000 years ago in your area, tribalism
[10:16.680 --> 10:21.060]  made perfect sense. That's what you'd be part of your group or you'd be dead. And so it's
[10:21.060 --> 10:22.900]  real but it's not real.
[10:22.900 --> 10:28.800]  So when they talk about colorblind and pigment and all this stuff, yeah, that's real. But
[10:28.800 --> 10:33.520]  the system is saying, hey, lower your guard. It's kind of like in Saving Private Ryan where
[10:33.520 --> 10:37.420]  the guy's fighting, Tom Hanks is fighting with a German soldier. And then the German
[10:37.420 --> 10:41.800]  soldier says, let's be friends, let's be friends, and then drives the knife into him.
[10:41.800 --> 10:46.120]  But it's not like the system of politically correct said, be nice, let's all be friends,
[10:46.120 --> 10:53.640]  let's have equality. And then that was always a double cross from the beginning. There were
[10:53.640 --> 10:58.240]  always groups really saying that Christians, abolitionists, others all over the world.
[10:58.240 --> 11:02.780]  There were slaves in Germany, some of the German provinces, the Germania, Austrian Hungarian
[11:02.780 --> 11:08.040]  Empire until the 1880s, white slaves. But they were so culturally controlled, they were
[11:08.040 --> 11:09.800]  proud of their slavery.
[11:09.800 --> 11:15.000]  Mercenary slaves, citizen soldiers raised from birth, Hessians, 10,000 of them were
[11:15.000 --> 11:21.360]  brought into one flotilla during the Revolutionary War. This is real history, and it's not taught
[11:21.360 --> 11:25.520]  there. You're only taught America had slavery. You're not taught about indentured servitude,
[11:25.520 --> 11:30.040]  you're not taught about sharecropping slavery basically. You're only taught about things
[11:30.040 --> 11:34.520]  to create a guilt narrative so that you're 15 years old and you're white, you feel like
[11:34.520 --> 11:35.620]  you're evil.
[11:35.620 --> 11:43.120]  Or you're 39 like I am, brought up to be colorblind, brought up in multicultural Dallas, friends,
[11:43.120 --> 11:49.360]  everything great. But that was only in phase one. Now the phase is the breakup of America
[11:49.360 --> 11:55.760]  into a larger North American union with racial subgroups throughout it. And that's Ford Foundation,
[11:55.760 --> 11:58.880]  that's Carnegie Endowment, that's congressional hearings.
[11:58.880 --> 12:03.680]  Anthony Sutton wrote about this, he worked for Congress. It's all there, that's the strategic
[12:03.680 --> 12:09.280]  plan. Because you've got less than 20 ruling global families worldwide over the Anglo-American
[12:09.280 --> 12:15.000]  establishment. And it was called Anglo because that's what the British Dutch Combine Empire
[12:15.000 --> 12:20.480]  was called, the Anglo slash Dutch Empire, Saxe-Coburg-Gothas with the House of Orange,
[12:20.480 --> 12:21.480]  it's also Gotha.
[12:21.480 --> 12:25.840]  And it's not even really a German royal family, it's a Transylvanian royal family and an Austrian
[12:25.840 --> 12:29.660]  royal family. Nothing against Transylvanians or Austrians. I'm just breaking down, there
[12:29.660 --> 12:36.520]  is a Transylvanian family, it's like out of a movie, a vampire movie, that runs the globe,
[12:36.520 --> 12:43.320]  or most of the globe is trying to mop up areas of Africa, Latin America, Asia, you name it.
[12:43.320 --> 12:49.400]  And this is the program, I mean, you thought it was House of Windsor, it's Saxe-Coburg-Gothas,
[12:49.400 --> 12:54.680]  and it's merged with the House of Rothschild. And that's just a fact, I mean, that's what
[12:54.680 --> 13:01.160]  it is. And it's all divide and conquer, the globalists will finance the Arabs to attack
[13:01.160 --> 13:02.160]  Israel.
[13:02.160 --> 13:05.480]  And the globalists will finance Israel to attack the Arabs, and then they have full
[13:05.480 --> 13:10.000]  spectrum dominance. Just like the globalists will finance the Pakistani Al-Qaeda and the
[13:10.000 --> 13:15.400]  Taliban Al-Qaeda. And publicly, that's always been public, that's always been in science
[13:15.400 --> 13:19.040]  journals, that's always been in anthropology journals, that's always been declassified,
[13:19.040 --> 13:20.680]  that's always been public.
[13:20.680 --> 13:25.840]  It was public on 9-11 that the hijackers trained at US bases and were US government agents.
[13:25.840 --> 13:30.640]  It came out in AP, Reuters, Newsweek, but back of the paper, yeah, Mohammed and others
[13:30.640 --> 13:35.400]  trained at a base, but that's national security, just don't worry about it. They're court marshalling
[13:35.400 --> 13:38.600]  the kernel that blew the whistle, never mind that.
[13:38.600 --> 13:44.400]  You see, it's full spectrum dominance, it's globalist above America, having America carry
[13:44.400 --> 13:52.080]  out its dirty work while we take the blame worldwide. While we take the blame worldwide,
[13:52.080 --> 13:57.080]  and literally, I was driving into work this morning, I called in on 5.90 AM, my local
[13:57.080 --> 14:04.840]  AM affiliate. And I called in the morning show, Marc Ed and Sergeant Sam, Sergeant Sam
[14:04.840 --> 14:08.720]  is a really funny, great guy, he's come by the office before, we're friends a long time.
[14:08.720 --> 14:16.360]  Marc Caesar's a nice guy, the other guy's kind of a liberal Ed on there. And I called
[14:16.360 --> 14:20.360]  in, they put me on air, and he goes, shout out and get to the point, because he was talking
[14:20.360 --> 14:24.640]  about basically, he was kind of the pro-abortion guy, and the other guys were the anti-abortion
[14:24.640 --> 14:25.640]  guys.
[14:25.640 --> 14:29.120]  And I heard this black guy calling, and he goes, I'm a black guy in East Austin, and
[14:29.120 --> 14:33.120]  there's too many kids, that's why we're going bankrupt, and that's why we got a deficit,
[14:33.120 --> 14:36.980]  we need to abort more kids. They were talking about protests going on in Austin right now
[14:36.980 --> 14:41.320]  with little kids out there part of the protest, and is it right to teach seven, eight year
[14:41.320 --> 14:42.760]  olds that they're aborting kids in there?
[14:42.760 --> 14:47.840]  And I say yes, know how evil it is, know these are humans that are dying. So I call in about
[14:47.840 --> 14:54.120]  that to go, excuse me, Japan's 1.3, the US is 1.5, 1.6, Italy's 1.3. For every two adults
[14:54.120 --> 14:59.520]  that were born, baby boomers in the late 40s, early 50s, worldwide, didn't matter what color
[14:59.520 --> 15:06.240]  you are, if it's an industrialized country, you're having a quarter less children than
[15:06.240 --> 15:10.960]  you need to just even replace people, and then societies collapse, the actuaries are
[15:10.960 --> 15:11.960]  known.
[15:11.960 --> 15:16.800]  And I explained the US has about a 1.5 except for giant immigrant influx. The system has
[15:16.800 --> 15:19.820]  a point, you gotta bring in immigrants from everywhere, problem is they're put on welfare
[15:19.820 --> 15:24.160]  and then bankrupt the system as a political takeover, it's not really replacement. Whites
[15:24.160 --> 15:29.300]  aren't having children, blacks aren't having children, 52% of blacks are aborted.
[15:29.300 --> 15:34.720]  And this guy was defending that, saying it was good, the caller. So I called in, some
[15:34.720 --> 15:40.460]  of you probably heard it out there, just to point out the demographics, because I've been
[15:40.460 --> 15:44.640]  around so many black liberals who aren't really liberals, they're authoritarians, but they
[15:44.640 --> 15:47.320]  believe they're liberals.
[15:47.320 --> 15:51.560]  And they're like, you know whites are evil, you know when whites are the devil, you know
[15:51.560 --> 15:55.800]  you're just inherently a bad race, you inherently are evil. And that's the oldest thing, Jews
[15:55.800 --> 16:00.160]  are inherently evil, blacks are inherently evil, Hispanics are inherently evil, the red
[16:00.160 --> 16:04.240]  man savage is inherently evil, the Asians are inherently evil.
[16:04.240 --> 16:07.040]  That black tribe across the river from me, even though I'm black and have their exact
[16:07.040 --> 16:14.240]  genetics, they're evil cuz they worship the pelican and we worship the stork or whatever,
[16:14.240 --> 16:18.360]  let's kill him. It's like the Star Trek episode from the 60s where one guy's got black on
[16:18.360 --> 16:20.240]  one side of his face, the other guy on the other.
[16:20.240 --> 16:24.060]  Even though they're exact same genetics, it's just one group's the rulers, the other. That's
[16:24.060 --> 16:28.520]  how things tend to organize around games, like you're wearing a red hat, I'm gonna kill
[16:28.520 --> 16:32.480]  you. It was just somebody in New York shot cuz he was wearing a wrong color hat.
[16:32.480 --> 16:38.040]  You're wearing blue, I'm gonna kill you. And I remember back in the early 90s, I'd be walking
[16:38.040 --> 16:41.760]  down the street with a blue baseball cap and had the cops pull over to me and say, and
[16:41.760 --> 16:47.360]  then that's an excuse, yeah, I'm really a crip wearing a blue baseball cap. Again, everybody
[16:47.360 --> 16:51.120]  likes to organize, dumb people like to organize in the gangs.
[16:51.120 --> 16:57.160]  I mean, that's basically not even so much dumb, just primitive, it's easy. And that's
[16:57.160 --> 17:05.440]  how the globalists are basically orchestrating this entire thing. And people really think,
[17:05.440 --> 17:09.320]  because that's why I've been at the Metro La Raza Hispanic Ku Klux Klan rallies. That's
[17:09.320 --> 17:10.320]  what it is.
[17:10.320 --> 17:13.440]  There's not just white Ku Klux Klan, there's black racist groups, all that. But it's so
[17:13.440 --> 17:19.800]  mainline people think, the city's paying for billboards that say this. There's TV ads how
[17:19.800 --> 17:26.920]  great this is. Well, I mean, it's sponsored by Miller Beer and Diet Coke, so you get diabetes
[17:26.920 --> 17:27.920]  and die.
[17:27.920 --> 17:32.240]  With the aspartame, that's on record, it must be good, let me go join it. And that's only
[17:32.240 --> 17:37.640]  because they wanna create the balkanization. The Democratic Party was out of power. They
[17:37.640 --> 17:41.800]  were the party of the Klan and lynching blacks and gun control for blacks. They didn't invent
[17:41.800 --> 17:42.800]  gun control.
[17:42.800 --> 17:49.020]  After slaves were freed, the Democratic Party basically got laws in the south pass so blacks
[17:49.020 --> 17:53.000]  couldn't have guns, so they could abuse them. And then they started really failing, and
[17:53.000 --> 17:58.320]  the Klan almost took Washington over. And it was actually big then with 500,000 people
[17:58.320 --> 17:59.320]  marching in DC.
[17:59.320 --> 18:03.080]  You can pull up the photos of Klan rallies in DC in the 20s, but you guys could probably
[18:03.080 --> 18:08.920]  do that on horseback and stuff. But they failed, because Christians, whites across the country
[18:08.920 --> 18:13.320]  mainly said no. And Republicans, and I'm not saying Republicans are good today, they're
[18:13.320 --> 18:17.460]  just the placeholder for the dominant party, the Democrats. So they said, in Margaret Singer's
[18:17.460 --> 18:21.620]  Letters Republic, type in Margaret Singer's racist letters, that'll pull them up.
[18:21.620 --> 18:26.840]  She said we're losing, and these are minutes with John D Rockefeller and others. She said
[18:26.840 --> 18:31.160]  we're losing the battle if you give me a million dollars a month. And then this was like in
[18:31.160 --> 18:38.920]  I think 1911. She was a big family planner, euthanizer, you name it, there in New York
[18:38.920 --> 18:45.000]  City. She said I'll go buy off all the black, W.E.B. Du Bois and everybody, I'll buy them
[18:45.000 --> 18:47.280]  off, we'll make them heroes, and we'll kill these people.
[18:47.280 --> 18:51.360]  She said we will eliminate the weeds, and they have. And I can sit there and talk to
[18:51.360 --> 18:56.160]  one of these black liberals, and they go, I'm glad they're killing 52%. I'm gonna get
[18:56.160 --> 19:02.740]  more money, cuz 52% of blacks are killed. And you're racist cuz you're white. And MSNBC
[19:02.740 --> 19:06.740]  will be like, good job, you're absolutely right.
[19:06.740 --> 19:10.640]  This is how the communists have taken over countries, ladies and gentlemen. And so the
[19:10.640 --> 19:17.880]  Democratic Party figured out we've gotta now be radical, radical, and actually come out
[19:17.880 --> 19:23.800]  and say whites are inherently bad. They did this then to fool all the minorities to think,
[19:23.800 --> 19:26.760]  my gosh, you must be really great people.
[19:26.760 --> 19:32.400]  And it worked like a charm. I mean, I've sat there at the Che Guevara type stuff with guys
[19:32.400 --> 19:35.880]  all wearing the same hats, same outfits. And they're like, we're gonna kill you when we
[19:35.880 --> 19:40.040]  take over. I mean, they're wearing shirts that say, plan a San Diego to kill all whites
[19:40.040 --> 19:45.000]  over the age of 16. It's been in the newspaper. And I'll go, but they're aborting Hispanics
[19:45.000 --> 19:49.920]  and they're not good. They're too many people. So killing Hispanics is good, but being white
[19:49.920 --> 19:55.000]  is racist. You're nobodies. You're dumbed down moron idiots that don't see the big eugenics
[19:55.000 --> 19:59.760]  picture. And I know I'm racist for not wanting to kill 52% of black people. I understand
[19:59.760 --> 20:01.280]  MSNBC is mad.
[20:01.280 --> 20:06.160]  You prepare by purchasing gold, food, and firearms. But if you don't have a home security

[23:09.480 --> 23:14.720]  I learned about RNA drops. I learned that 97% of my DNA that scientists have called
[23:14.720 --> 23:19.880]  junk is actually packed with millions of gene switches that play a critical role in controlling
[23:19.880 --> 23:25.040]  how my cells, organs and other tissues behave. I learned I don't have to put up with disease
[23:25.040 --> 23:30.600]  decay or decline like I've been conditioned to believe. I began taking RNA drops, a 100%
[23:30.600 --> 23:35.080]  natural formula designed to turn on those switches and provide me with amazing health
[23:35.080 --> 23:42.000]  and joy. Learn more about RNA drops and order a free sample today. Visit rnafreesample.com.

[24:09.040 --> 24:12.720]  us. Aaron Dykes is coming in to talk about the new white guilt bracelets that you'll
[24:12.720 --> 24:18.940]  have to wear if you want to get college tuition supplemented. And we're going to tie it into
[24:18.940 --> 24:23.480]  an incredible article that I mentioned yesterday, but I didn't read some of the passages. What
[24:23.480 --> 24:26.760]  can be done to reverse this tide of belligerent ignorance?
[24:26.760 --> 24:33.120]  Well, we can have the government form task forces and go after, wait for it. They're
[24:33.120 --> 24:38.400]  not jihadists, they are white right wing Americans, nearly all with obsessive attachment to guns
[24:38.400 --> 24:42.560]  who may represent a greater danger to the lives of American civilians than international
[24:42.560 --> 24:48.480]  terrorists. That's why Homeland Security money needs to be moved from the hunt for foreign
[24:48.480 --> 24:53.760]  terrorists to the domestic white terrorists, the LA Times.
[24:53.760 --> 24:57.960]  I mean, you read something like that. And I knew that was coming because all the training
[24:57.960 --> 25:04.560]  manuals, all the training videos that we broke years ago was whites are terrorists, minorities,
[25:04.560 --> 25:09.960]  you're going to report them and I guess go hunt them down. And then that's the new, and
[25:09.960 --> 25:16.040]  you're like, this is insane. It's designed to make whites get totally freaked out and
[25:16.040 --> 25:22.240]  just become a reactionary, racially voting block under Republicans that then control
[25:22.240 --> 25:23.240]  them.
[25:23.240 --> 25:30.000]  And then the Republicans will kind of act as a more honest racial party at one level
[25:30.000 --> 25:33.960]  while acting like they're trying to be inclusive. I mean, the globalists know what they're doing.
[25:33.960 --> 25:37.320]  And that's why they're in control and that's why we're slaves. And that's why liberty and
[25:37.320 --> 25:42.620]  prosperity is being annihilated. It's called divide and conquer, it's called balkanization
[25:42.620 --> 25:49.040]  and it feels good and everyone basically loves it.
[25:49.040 --> 25:58.040]  Continuing, the new Pope, Pope Francis, the first Latin American, first Jesuit. Well,
[25:58.040 --> 26:02.260]  that'll add to all the theories that the Jesuits really run the Catholic Church. And the first
[26:02.260 --> 26:05.500]  Pope Francis to lead the world's Catholics.
[26:05.500 --> 26:13.560]  Reminds me of the quote from Stripes, where he goes, don't call me Francis, call me Psycho
[26:13.560 --> 26:20.080]  or I'll kill you. He goes, okay, Francis. If you haven't seen Stripes, I'm sorry. I'm
[26:20.080 --> 26:25.800]  a fan of kind of those old corny comedies. It's not as good as Caddyshack, but it pops
[26:25.800 --> 26:26.800]  in my head.
[26:26.800 --> 26:31.920]  So we've got that report. Now, lighten up, Francis. That's exactly what he says, you're
[26:31.920 --> 26:36.400]  right, I didn't quote it properly. He goes, all right, Francis. And he goes, my name's
[26:36.400 --> 26:41.440]  Psycho. You call me Francis again, I'll kill you. The sergeant goes, lighten up, Francis.
[26:41.440 --> 26:45.840]  Yeah, that's pretty good. Thanks for reminding me. John Bowne knows all this stuff.
[26:45.840 --> 26:50.160]  All right, let me give you some of the other news that we'll cover after Aaron's in here
[26:50.160 --> 26:57.680]  with us. And we do have Sean Siegel in studio, who is the head of a major vaccine awareness
[26:57.680 --> 27:03.280]  group and has just incredible scientists, doctors, you name it on his radio show, VaxTruth.org.
[27:03.280 --> 27:11.240]  I'm just very impressed with his research. And he also works with Marcy Terry. So we're
[27:11.240 --> 27:15.120]  gonna get her on with us as well. I'm gonna get them on in the last hour because that's
[27:15.120 --> 27:18.200]  a real public service announcement.
[27:18.200 --> 27:25.640]  It's amazing on the racial front. You can abort 30% of Hispanics roughly before they're
[27:25.640 --> 27:31.200]  born. You can abort 25% of whites before they're born. You can abort 52% of blacks before they're
[27:31.200 --> 27:35.320]  born. And then say it's good for the economy, and then say, well, they'll just end up on
[27:35.320 --> 27:36.840]  welfare and in prison.
[27:36.840 --> 27:41.580]  And I hear blacks and Hispanics call into the talk shows, and I've debated it on liberal
[27:41.580 --> 27:46.400]  radio shows, really fascist tyranny shows that call themselves liberal. And I'm like,
[27:46.400 --> 27:49.560]  what are you gonna do with all these babies? Remember the abortuary guy last year? Did
[27:49.560 --> 27:51.640]  they go to his house, the abortion doctor?
[27:51.640 --> 27:56.440]  And he goes, who's gonna take all these ugly black babies? And he's an Asian guy. And I'm
[27:56.440 --> 28:02.360]  telling you, that's standard Indian guy. Well, technically, that is Asian, my friend, pretty
[28:02.360 --> 28:16.400]  much. So the point is, is that he says, who's going to keep all these ugly black babies?
[28:16.400 --> 28:20.960]  And that's held as liberal. I mean, if you call blacks ugly and evil and need to be killed,
[28:20.960 --> 28:21.960]  you are a liberal.
[28:21.960 --> 28:25.460]  As long as you say whites are bad, and then a lot of black folks will go, well, you're
[28:25.460 --> 28:29.120]  saying kill me, but you hate whites, that's good. It's a white person saying it to them.
[28:29.120 --> 28:34.420]  I mean, it is just mind control. And that's what Aldous Huxley talked about in his farewell
[28:34.420 --> 28:37.880]  speech before he died in 62 at Berkeley.
[28:37.880 --> 28:41.640]  You gotta listen to it, it's like an hour and a half long, it's online. I've played
[28:41.640 --> 28:46.480]  some clips of it in my film Endgame. He says, we've learned how to program you to love your
[28:46.480 --> 28:52.920]  servitude. And we're going to end the family, and we're going to end society, as you know,
[28:52.920 --> 28:55.320]  and we're gonna just get rid of the majority of you.
[28:55.320 --> 29:01.520]  And that's the plan. And my brother runs the UN program to do it at UNESCO, Julian Huxley,
[29:01.520 --> 29:05.620]  Aldous Huxley's brother. And they write books, they tell you you're doing it. And he said
[29:05.620 --> 29:12.080]  by 2000, they have most of this in. They are 10 years behind, in the words of Wieczynski.
[29:12.080 --> 29:14.720]  I'm doing anything that's even further, because it is so crazy.
[29:14.720 --> 29:19.080]  I mean, the French Revolution run by the Illuminati, look it up, the Jacobins, they wanted a nine
[29:19.080 --> 29:26.320]  day workweek, the end of the family, a return to barbarism. It's all about playing God.
[29:26.320 --> 29:29.140]  But I know I'm getting off into history of people. I'm gonna run over some of the big
[29:29.140 --> 29:34.280]  news here. But the plan is have America carry out the globalist dirty work, and then blame
[29:34.280 --> 29:36.940]  us politically for it.
[29:36.940 --> 29:41.940]  So world poll, image of US declines, which was the plan I've always told you, while the
[29:41.940 --> 29:47.840]  globalists move to the EU and China, and deindustrialize us when they're done with us, they'll implode
[29:47.840 --> 29:50.160]  us into a giant third world race war.
[29:50.160 --> 30:01.520]  We're on the march. The Empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[30:01.520 --> 30:06.200]  Now that we have moved into the winter season, there is an increased need to support our

[33:06.840 --> 33:29.960]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. All right, my friends, you have found it the front lines
[33:29.960 --> 33:39.040]  of the info war trying to build a true, free, enlightened Renaissance society of true liberty,
[33:39.040 --> 33:44.960]  where we're judged by the character of our daily activities, by what we build, by what
[33:44.960 --> 33:51.400]  we construct, not by numbers, not by groups. The globalists are at war against the individual.
[33:51.400 --> 33:56.120]  That's why they say gun owners are responsible for anybody that's killed, not the criminals
[33:56.120 --> 34:00.720]  using tools, like a baseball bat or a knife. Is it the baseball bat or the knife? No, they're
[34:00.720 --> 34:07.360]  saying we collectively did Sandy Hook. And it's now coming out. In fact, Bloomberg's
[34:07.360 --> 34:11.240]  bragging about it. And Aaron Dyer said a report on this yesterday, we're gonna cover it in
[34:11.240 --> 34:17.080]  a moment, where he said, I was all ready and set for the next shooting to exploit it to
[34:17.080 --> 34:18.080]  get the guns.
[34:18.080 --> 34:22.360]  And that's what Feinstein said two weeks ago. She said, there will be more events and we're
[34:22.360 --> 34:27.000]  going to get this done. They have a plan. That's why Obama said, we can't allow one
[34:27.000 --> 34:33.560]  more shooting. We can't allow one more thing like this to happen. You gotta turn your guns
[34:33.560 --> 34:41.080]  in or the kids will die. Kids died, my gosh, it's your fault. A woman in New York, Manhattan
[34:41.080 --> 34:45.640]  mother jumps eight stories to her death with her infant son strapped to her chest.
[34:45.640 --> 34:54.280]  She survives with minor injuries cuz she hit on her back and the baby was in a little carrier
[34:54.280 --> 34:59.620]  on her front. So the baby bounced and she said she was a bad mother. I bet a million
[34:59.620 --> 35:05.080]  dollars if somebody wants to wager that she was on antipsychotics, which actually make
[35:05.080 --> 35:07.280]  you psychotic on the insert.
[35:07.280 --> 35:10.920]  They call them antidepressants. They're really antipsychotics and they make you psychotic.
[35:10.920 --> 35:17.440]  I mean, it's always the same. It just makes them whack out and do it. You read about mothers
[35:17.440 --> 35:23.680]  chopping their kids arms off, drowning them. But actually, it's not her fault. It's the
[35:23.680 --> 35:30.360]  building's fault. Because it's the gun's fault. Somebody got shot in New York for wearing
[35:30.360 --> 35:31.920]  a hat the wrong color.
[35:31.920 --> 35:37.640]  That's also in the news yesterday by a gang. But it's not gang mentality that's the fault.
[35:37.640 --> 35:43.320]  It's the gun and the hat. And also she was white. So that's another reason she's white.
[35:43.320 --> 35:47.400]  So according to the LA Times, when she's married to it, I mean, if you're a white guy, you're
[35:47.400 --> 35:49.240]  a terrorist according to the LA Times.
[35:49.240 --> 35:56.360]  So I mean, that's the crazy logic they would have you believe cuz she's not an individual.
[35:56.360 --> 36:00.760]  It's not her fault. It's not drugs she may have been on. It's the fault of the eight
[36:00.760 --> 36:04.440]  story window balcony she jumped off of. And I think that's reasonable. I mean, it's the
[36:04.440 --> 36:11.880]  building did it. An inanimate object. I mean, it was that sheer face. It was that base jump
[36:11.880 --> 36:16.600]  without a parachute that killed her, just like the gun.
[36:16.600 --> 36:24.000]  And so I say, ban buildings above one story. And make everyone, well, see, that's where
[36:24.000 --> 36:28.440]  this logic goes. That's where all of this is happening. They have the science fiction
[36:28.440 --> 36:33.680]  books written where they make everybody handicapped if anybody else is handicapped. And people
[36:33.680 --> 36:37.960]  thought, that's overdone. No, no, that's where all this is going. So we're gonna be breaking
[36:37.960 --> 36:38.960]  all of that down.
[36:38.960 --> 36:44.600]  We're gonna go to the economic news. Physicists say they have found the Higgs boson, which
[36:44.600 --> 36:50.780]  they plan to do at the Hadron superconducting supercollider. So we're gonna be getting into
[36:50.780 --> 36:55.640]  all of that. This was an alternative news a few days ago. Now it's in Reuters today.
[36:55.640 --> 37:01.320]  You asked to let spy agencies scour American finances. Of course, the headlines a few days
[37:01.320 --> 37:04.040]  ago were they've already been doing it.
[37:04.040 --> 37:07.520]  But now that's what his executive order last year did. Congress wouldn't pass it, so he
[37:07.520 --> 37:17.440]  just did it. They're just trying to quasi legalize what they've already been criminally
[37:17.440 --> 37:21.380]  doing. But I don't care if Obama signs an order and tells Congress they can't see it.
[37:21.380 --> 37:25.980]  But now Congress is demanding to see it. So we're told, you know what? Spy agencies run
[37:25.980 --> 37:32.640]  by foreign globalists are watching everything you're doing with no warrant.
[37:32.640 --> 37:36.920]  And guess what? The new threat in Al-Qaeda, it's white people, it's returning veterans,
[37:36.920 --> 37:41.060]  it's conservatives, it's libertarians, and that's not racist at all. And the government's
[37:41.060 --> 37:45.240]  teamed up with everybody else who are useful idiots if they join it. Hey, let's get them,
[37:45.240 --> 37:46.240]  let's get those gun owners.
[37:46.240 --> 37:52.040]  Yeah, I'm turning my gun in. They want you to associate racially with having no rights
[37:52.040 --> 37:57.120]  and socialism under a fascist regime. Socialism, grassroots, fascism above it, that's the real
[37:57.120 --> 38:01.640]  system. They want you to associate your identity with being an idiot, with being a chump, with
[38:01.640 --> 38:06.680]  being a sucker, with being a schmuck, with being a mark, with being a fool.
[38:06.680 --> 38:13.780]  Well, I'm not your fool, okay? And everybody needs to just get religion, get reality, get
[38:13.780 --> 38:19.040]  social engineering. Most people that understand this go and join the dark side. I've talked
[38:19.040 --> 38:22.160]  to a lot of people in the power structure and they just go, come on, man, you know the
[38:22.160 --> 38:24.040]  public is, they're a bunch of idiots.
[38:24.040 --> 38:28.160]  They're not gonna listen, they don't want your help, they wanna be slaves. Come jump
[38:28.160 --> 38:31.880]  on the team and come in for the big win. Well, you know what? It doesn't look to me like
[38:31.880 --> 38:36.880]  you're jumped on a team and coming in for a big win. Society is falling apart and no
[38:36.880 --> 38:39.040]  one is insulated from this craziness.
[38:39.040 --> 38:43.120]  The big lie is when you screw somebody over, they're gonna have the attitude to screw people
[38:43.120 --> 38:47.320]  over and it's all gonna come back on you. And I don't want that on my conscience, I
[38:47.320 --> 38:51.880]  don't want that in my name, okay? And I'm sick of the government and the social engineers
[38:51.880 --> 38:56.440]  and the power structure acting like they're the great high and mighty that hand down the
[38:56.440 --> 39:00.920]  law and they say what's racist and they say what's good and they say what's bad when they
[39:00.920 --> 39:07.220]  are a bunch of murdering, lying, eugenicist, social engineer globalist who 24 seven go
[39:07.220 --> 39:12.600]  to Delphi technique seminars and stuff on how to manipulate and lie to you.
[39:12.600 --> 39:17.160]  You know what I'm using? My hardwired gut and instinct for liberty. I don't need to
[39:17.160 --> 39:22.520]  go to your fancy schools. I got the truth that trumps all your lies all day. I don't
[39:22.520 --> 39:27.320]  need your psychopath silver tongue. I've got the tongue for liberty. I've got a tongue
[39:27.320 --> 39:28.440]  that wants to survive.
[39:28.440 --> 39:32.120]  I've got the tongue that knows the truth. And you know what? The truth is self evident.
[39:32.120 --> 39:36.640]  It's not like it's some big secret. But because it's laying all around us, people don't value
[39:36.640 --> 39:42.320]  it. People don't value it. They think evil and corruption is going to give them power
[39:42.320 --> 39:43.800]  and it's not going to do that.
[39:43.800 --> 39:47.900]  Now let me tell you, as I said yesterday, we're gonna go to Aaron. I'm gonna start the
[39:47.900 --> 39:53.240]  next hour. Go to your calls and cover news. Call free number to join us. 800-25-99231.
[39:53.240 --> 40:00.600]  First time callers. 800-25-99231. But I want to say this here right now. I told you they
[40:00.600 --> 40:05.280]  would shift everything into a race war for Homeland Security and I told you that 11 years
[40:05.280 --> 40:06.280]  ago.
[40:06.280 --> 40:09.180]  I could see the writing on the wall. It's in my films. It's on record. It's in police
[40:09.180 --> 40:17.200]  state 3 total enslavement 2002. It's all broken down because I've been to the drills. I've
[40:17.200 --> 40:21.500]  read the manuals. I've gotten the secret documents. It's been national news probably 20 times
[40:21.500 --> 40:22.500]  or more.
[40:22.500 --> 40:28.440]  It's on record, okay? I know what I'm talking about. But it's gotten totally obvious in
[40:28.440 --> 40:32.960]  the open the last two years because this is the game plan. It was all laid out. Bush,
[40:32.960 --> 40:38.520]  Obama, the fix is in. Romney to take the dive, all of it, okay? It's not that Obama's bad
[40:38.520 --> 40:43.660]  so Romney's good. It's all bad. It's not that fascist are bad so communist are good. It's
[40:43.660 --> 40:45.660]  communist and fascist are bad.
[40:45.660 --> 40:51.760]  Learn that it's not just the two choices they give you. It's not globalist bad so Che Guevara
[40:51.760 --> 40:56.760]  good. No, it's all bad, okay? You need to understand that and you need to not just see
[40:56.760 --> 41:02.960]  boldness by the globalist as their right to rule. Hitler was bold. Stalin was bold. Fidel
[41:02.960 --> 41:05.640]  Castro was bold. Mao was very bold.
[41:05.640 --> 41:11.680]  Che Guevara was a follower of Mao and wanted forced collectivization that killed about
[41:11.680 --> 41:17.280]  a third of the Chinese people. You're talking about mass death here, ladies and gentlemen.
[41:17.280 --> 41:21.280]  But it's sexy. It's fun. These young idiots out there, they just have this smile like,
[41:21.280 --> 41:26.080]  you're scared of my power wearing some stupid iconic image when I actually want to free
[41:26.080 --> 41:27.080]  you.
[41:27.080 --> 41:31.080]  Because if I don't free you, we're not getting out of this because we've got to have a revolution
[41:31.080 --> 41:35.400]  of awakening to have any future. And it's got to happen with you deciding to get out
[41:35.400 --> 41:39.860]  of your emotional garbage and to get outside the box with full spectrum analysis and see
[41:39.860 --> 41:44.560]  how you're being played. And sure, they set things up in a racial, cultural, regional
[41:44.560 --> 41:45.720]  divide and conquer.
[41:45.720 --> 41:49.400]  So there are real people buying into it who are tribally coming against you if you're
[41:49.400 --> 41:53.560]  white or if you're any other color. There is an opposing racist group and you see the
[41:53.560 --> 41:57.480]  racism and you're white and you're told it doesn't exist and you're inherently bad. So
[41:57.480 --> 42:03.080]  it makes you mad so you become a white supremacist, which is also globalist run, just like a prison
[42:03.080 --> 42:08.600]  is broken up into racial groups. If you don't have this awakening and this understanding,
[42:08.600 --> 42:11.860]  they're already putting poison in our food and water no matter what color you are.
[42:11.860 --> 42:15.640]  They're already setting up death panels. They're already gearing up for all this. We're all
[42:15.640 --> 42:21.760]  under attack and we've got to have a full shift awakening to this if we have any hope,
[42:21.760 --> 42:27.640]  okay? If a conservative said black babies were ugly, a doctor, it would be national
[42:27.640 --> 42:32.660]  news on MSNBC for six months straights and riots all over the country.
[42:32.660 --> 42:37.000]  But when the establishment shoots a black youth in the back for no reason in New York,
[42:37.000 --> 42:42.280]  nothing's ever going to be done about it. Or when every liberal I've ever talked to
[42:42.280 --> 42:45.560]  says, who's going to adopt the black babies? Which actually there are groups to do that.
[42:45.560 --> 42:49.760]  In fact, you have the black baby clip? Let's go ahead and play that clip and then I'm going
[42:49.760 --> 42:53.600]  to go to the news and go to Aaron.
[42:53.600 --> 42:56.920]  There's Planned Parenthood tapes, Project Veritas about, I want to give money to get
[42:56.920 --> 43:01.080]  rid of the blacks. Yes, we understand. So let's go ahead and play this clip. But again,
[43:01.080 --> 43:07.400]  you'll never see this. Because again, an enemy, we had German soldiers in World War II that
[43:07.400 --> 43:11.520]  came to US bases dressed in US military uniforms who'd been brought up in the US and spoke
[43:11.520 --> 43:12.520]  fluent English.
[43:12.520 --> 43:17.880]  Nowadays, people would salute them. They would salute a foreign Chinese general who was about
[43:17.880 --> 43:22.520]  to nuke America if he wore a uniform, even if they knew he was a communist general. Because
[43:22.520 --> 43:26.960]  the uniform is what matters. If hijackers put on the captain's uniform, they would salute
[43:26.960 --> 43:27.960]  him.
[43:27.960 --> 43:32.400]  They would slit their baby's throats under orders, because it's about serving the image.
[43:32.400 --> 43:36.120]  You understand that? And of course, I'm being a little sarcastic here. But the globalists
[43:36.120 --> 43:40.360]  have hijacked, they've taken everything over. They're puppeting things with a hand puppet.
[43:40.360 --> 43:43.980]  And you've got to have that epiphany. You've got to have that quickening of understanding.
[43:43.980 --> 43:49.760]  You've got to understand how this works if there's any future. And again, it is a sacrament,
[43:49.760 --> 43:51.680]  a sacrament to kill their babies.
[43:51.680 --> 43:57.400]  And you're racist if you don't want to kill the minority, now majority, babies. So see,
[43:57.400 --> 44:01.240]  that's why I just want you to know that. And I know it hurts your ideology of race-based
[44:01.240 --> 44:05.600]  liberation theology. You were taught if you're white, black, Hispanic, Asian, in public school,
[44:05.600 --> 44:06.600]  then in the college.
[44:06.600 --> 44:12.480]  I understand this is freaking you out, because your whole identity is about this. But this
[44:12.480 --> 44:16.640]  is the reality. And just admit who you are and admit what you are, and then there's hope
[44:16.640 --> 44:19.640]  for you. Let's go ahead and go to this clip.
[44:19.640 --> 44:37.360]  I'm not profiting. I was a taxpayer. I do not wish to pay for those babies to be born
[44:37.360 --> 44:42.520]  and brought up and kill those people in Colorado. Go ahead and pay for that. Let me see you
[44:42.520 --> 44:44.080]  adopt one of those girls.
[44:44.080 --> 44:51.280]  All right, you've got evil whites, obviously terrorists, because the LA Times, and they
[44:51.280 --> 44:57.040]  say being white is terrorism. We played the ugly black baby part. I heard it in there
[44:57.040 --> 44:59.360]  once. I mean, there's more of it coming up. We don't have time to play at all. There's
[44:59.360 --> 45:00.360]  time for an ugly black baby.
[45:00.360 --> 45:04.080]  You'll get that in a bunch of other videos. And the evil whites are there saying, let
[45:04.080 --> 45:07.860]  us adopt the baby. They obviously only be sent to a FEMA camp. I mean, they're scum.
[45:07.860 --> 45:18.080]  But the Indian guy from Asia, he's good. He's a wise person. And so he's obviously right.
[45:18.080 --> 45:21.320]  Now if the white Christians said kill the ugly black babies, it'd be all over the news.
[45:21.320 --> 45:25.140]  But see, that's cuz they're white. They're bad people. And you have to understand that.
[45:25.140 --> 45:31.060]  And so if I put up a billboard saying whites rise up, that's racist. If the city of Austin
[45:31.060 --> 45:35.480]  pays for it for Hispanics, that's a good thing. And there's no doublespeak there. There's
[45:35.480 --> 45:38.600]  no 1984 there. There's no, no, no.
[45:38.600 --> 45:42.400]  And so here it is. Government wants volunteers to wear white guilt bracelets. Aaron Dykes
[45:42.400 --> 45:48.280]  is here to talk about that. Then the LA Times is also reporting again saying, quote, the
[45:48.280 --> 45:53.800]  new threat is not al-Qaeda. They're not jihadists. They are white right wing Americans. And that
[45:53.800 --> 45:55.600]  they believe in a new world order conspiracy theory.
[45:55.600 --> 46:00.480]  Doesn't matter world governments being openly set up everywhere. And by the way, we don't
[46:00.480 --> 46:06.240]  just have the CNS news article on this. We have what you do to learn in the reeducation
[46:06.240 --> 46:10.360]  camp that's the college or the AmeriCorps, if you want any of this government funding.
[46:10.360 --> 46:13.880]  And soon they're now announcing compulsory service where you have to go into AmeriCorps
[46:13.880 --> 46:16.320]  and FEMA Corps to get out of high school or college.
[46:16.320 --> 46:19.160]  In fact, they said four years ago it'd be the law, but they haven't been able to do
[46:19.160 --> 46:23.920]  that. But they're trying. And see, it's about social engineering. Once you're in a collective
[46:23.920 --> 46:29.880]  system, we get to say what you eat. Well, if a bunch of blacks are on welfare as a cliche,
[46:29.880 --> 46:32.520]  well then we must be able to kill them because we're paying for them.
[46:32.520 --> 46:37.640]  See how that works? It's not get you on welfare, force you on welfare. Blacks had less illegitimacy
[46:37.640 --> 46:43.720]  than whites in the 1930s and 40s. I mean, look it up, look at the demographics. They
[46:43.720 --> 46:49.340]  had under 10%, whites at a higher level, extremely religious, extremely conservative, extremely
[46:49.340 --> 46:54.840]  upright, extremely setting up powerful communities and businesses and threatening the power structure.
[46:54.840 --> 46:58.640]  They just integrated, and I'm not against immigration as a real integration, a fake
[46:58.640 --> 47:03.240]  integration with cultural death programmed into it. Now blacks are 93% illegitimate.
[47:03.240 --> 47:07.340]  You go, what's wrong with single mothers? That's the spin. No, no, no, you're just four
[47:07.340 --> 47:11.640]  times more likely to be in prison or drugs. If there was never anybody at home, ever.
[47:11.640 --> 47:16.300]  Now, if there's a divorce later, that's another issue. It's not as bad. The point is they
[47:16.300 --> 47:20.580]  know what they've done. Now they're breaking up everybody's families. That's the model.
[47:20.580 --> 47:25.020]  And it's so cold blooded to sit here and not be some bleeding heart, but to want a fair
[47:25.020 --> 47:29.160]  shake for everybody. Cuz I'm confident, I don't need to put you down so I can be successful.
[47:29.160 --> 47:33.160]  I wanna build you up. And hell, if you get built up higher than me, you'll just raise
[47:33.160 --> 47:36.960]  everything up. The rising tide raises all ships. I understand how the universe really
[47:36.960 --> 47:39.260]  works cuz it's just prima facie.
[47:39.260 --> 47:45.560]  It's in my soul, my gut, everything. And in the kingdom of the blind, the one-eyed man
[47:45.560 --> 47:50.920]  is king. As I think it was a Protestant philosopher said about 400 years ago. And people said,
[47:50.920 --> 47:54.560]  what does that mean? Well, you could see it as the Illuminati perspective. They want you
[47:54.560 --> 48:00.200]  culturally blind, spiritually blind, financially blind, because then you can be fully enslaved.
[48:00.200 --> 48:03.520]  So I bring in Aaron Dykes, and while he's talking, I've got a document, Cam, I could
[48:03.520 --> 48:09.920]  show prisonplanet.tv viewers the actual mental model. It says addressing racial privilege,
[48:09.920 --> 48:14.400]  a mental model for white anti-racist.
[48:14.400 --> 48:19.640]  And it shows them to see everything according to a group, not as individual, and like Jews
[48:19.640 --> 48:25.800]  to start wearing the yellow star, but it's a white bracelet. And Aaron Dykes, we're gonna
[48:25.800 --> 48:30.240]  come back from break in a moment, but break down this amazing report. It's up at infowars.com.
[48:30.240 --> 48:34.840]  That's the thing, life is about individuals. I take anybody from any background with the
[48:34.840 --> 48:39.400]  basic respect until it's violated, no matter where they come from. They do want us thinking
[48:39.400 --> 48:41.840]  in groups and they want us all brainwashed.
[48:41.840 --> 48:45.800]  I am kind of a bleeding heart in terms of I don't like to see people downtrodden. But
[48:45.800 --> 48:50.000]  that doesn't mean I'm gonna hand the reins of power over to big government who want everyone
[48:50.000 --> 48:51.760]  dependent, who wanted to base people.
[48:51.760 --> 48:56.720]  No, no, they want them dead. Yeah, and they're like, I wanna buy the fact that you're inherently
[48:56.720 --> 49:01.120]  evil whitey. I wanna kill my babies. I'm like, okay, go ahead and kill your babies then.
[49:01.120 --> 49:05.200]  I've been personally attacked for not endorsing the black genocide. I don't, I won't endorse
[49:05.200 --> 49:06.200]  that.
[49:06.200 --> 49:08.720]  That's cuz you're racist. You're against blacks cuz you don't want them dead.
[49:08.720 --> 49:15.240]  But this is the whole like sensitivity, brainwashing, political correctness to an extreme. And anyone
[49:15.240 --> 49:19.520]  who follows these guidelines is not gonna be respected by other race groups for bowing
[49:19.520 --> 49:20.520]  down to put-
[49:20.520 --> 49:21.520]  Racist.
[49:21.520 --> 49:26.400]  They want you to deal with your white privilege and put on a white wristband and walk around
[49:26.400 --> 49:29.800]  and talk to people about how you're coming to terms with your white privilege and-
[49:29.800 --> 49:33.880]  It actually says that. I'm gonna show people a document cam right here. And folks, the
[49:33.880 --> 49:37.600]  answer to this, we'll talk about that after the break, is to just stop buying into it.
[49:37.600 --> 49:42.000]  We have to totally go against political correctness. It is because it's Soviet, they used this
[49:42.000 --> 49:43.600]  in the Soviet Union, they called it that.
[49:43.600 --> 49:46.880]  Yeah, and they were all about that. But I'm not the first to point out that the slavery
[49:46.880 --> 49:52.440]  today is primarily economic. We're all under the debt bubble burden and being controlled
[49:52.440 --> 49:56.560]  by the larger system. Slavery is a horrible legacy, but it happened most-
[49:56.560 --> 50:01.000]  They want you to be obsessed with that so that you don't see the real current thing
[50:01.000 --> 50:02.000]  happening.
[50:02.000 --> 50:04.680]  And they want people of color, as they call them here in this document, I'm not necessarily-
[50:04.680 --> 50:08.200]  Which is even politically incorrect. See, they can't even follow their strictures.
[50:08.200 --> 50:11.960]  They want people from minority backgrounds not to embrace their rights and to think that
[50:11.960 --> 50:15.940]  the American Revolution is shameful because they were involved in slavery. And it is in
[50:15.940 --> 50:20.080]  aspects of slavery, but we all have to embrace our rights. It's too bad those rights weren't
[50:20.080 --> 50:21.400]  recognized for other groups sooner.
[50:21.400 --> 50:24.040]  But they'll never look at the real history. The only point is they tried to get rid of
[50:24.040 --> 50:27.380]  it then too, but it's a side issue. History is criminal.
[50:27.380 --> 50:31.560]  They want a guilt trip, everyone. The SPLC is involved in this, all the cultural programming.
[50:31.560 --> 50:36.440]  And like you said, this is being driven through schools, through AmeriCorps, through the college
[50:36.440 --> 50:40.240]  programs. And they want everyone indoctrinated for the new society.
[50:40.240 --> 50:44.040]  And again, they know that the ones they can get will join the socialist army because they
[50:44.040 --> 50:47.920]  attach this race stuff to- and you're a communist too, to prove you're good. They know the rest
[50:47.920 --> 50:52.520]  of the whites will run and become absolute racist, which is what they want. They want
[50:52.520 --> 50:56.760]  everybody divided in groups instead of the culture being the liberty, bill of rights,
[50:56.760 --> 51:00.640]  private property. They're deadly afraid of individualism.
[51:00.640 --> 51:01.640]  They're pushing buttons.
[51:01.640 --> 51:05.480]  If you're listening, you know your basic freedoms are being threatened every day. If you're
[51:05.480 --> 51:10.200]  listening, you know the economy is not getting better. You know gas and food prices are still
[51:10.200 --> 51:11.200]  skyrocketing.

[54:17.360 --> 54:22.040]  operated and created this new technocracy by the basic divide and conquer type race
[54:22.040 --> 54:28.160]  stuff that's being engaged in. They are also putting additives, the food and water. I mean,
[54:28.160 --> 54:33.360]  we're under scientific manipulation and only being aware of, kind of like the Truman Show,
[54:33.360 --> 54:38.280]  that there's a larger system outside of that. And that's literally what it's becoming. That's
[54:38.280 --> 54:43.000]  how the globalists describe it, that we're like animals in artificial habitat and they're
[54:43.000 --> 54:46.960]  sociologists, anthropologists, biologists studying us. I mean, that's how they describe
[54:46.960 --> 54:47.960]  it in all their books.
[54:47.960 --> 54:52.240]  Aaron, I know you've read over 100 books and probably 300, 400 of their manuals. You've
[54:52.240 --> 54:55.760]  reviewed them on the Nightly News the last few years. You've been here almost seven years
[54:55.760 --> 55:00.040]  now, looking at this. You were going over to Charlotte Iserby, who was number two of
[55:00.040 --> 55:03.880]  the Department of Education under Reagan. I mean, she's got the studies in there where
[55:03.880 --> 55:08.700]  they tried in the 50s and 60s to play brown hair against blonde hair in public schools
[55:08.700 --> 55:09.700]  as test.
[55:09.700 --> 55:12.960]  I mean, they want divide and conquer. That's what they're always telling you about. Let's
[55:12.960 --> 55:16.840]  come together, so let's look at our differences. They are exacerbating them.
[55:16.840 --> 55:20.840]  Yeah, and you alluded to the fact that the technocrats, the eugenicists use data and
[55:20.840 --> 55:25.560]  the power of experts always to rule over us. And it's always the experts telling us to
[55:25.560 --> 55:30.560]  do the family planning, the eugenics program. And they have studied psychology and specifically
[55:30.560 --> 55:35.100]  applied it to their rulership, and they're punching our buttons with race issues.
[55:35.100 --> 55:40.040]  That's what they're doing. The real racism has mainly died out, at least in my generation.
[55:40.040 --> 55:43.800]  Everybody was friends with everybody, is very cosmopolitan, very diverse, at least in my
[55:43.800 --> 55:44.800]  school.
[55:44.800 --> 55:45.800]  That was phase one.
[55:45.800 --> 55:46.800]  I know it's not like that everywhere.
[55:46.800 --> 55:48.020]  No, but that's phase one.
[55:48.020 --> 55:52.880]  But the point is, they're not just doing it with race. In the studies from education and
[55:52.880 --> 55:57.800]  the things they did in experimental fashions as far back as the 60s, Isabey has an old
[55:57.800 --> 55:58.800]  document.
[55:58.800 --> 56:02.360]  They put estrogen in the plastic and it's in government documents, and the White House
[56:02.360 --> 56:06.840]  Science Czar admits it. They literally attack our testicles.
[56:06.840 --> 56:07.840]  I know that.
[56:07.840 --> 56:09.880]  But that's racist too, to say they shouldn't do it.
[56:09.880 --> 56:13.040]  But all the black leaders have gone along with the eugenics. The Chinese leaders have
[56:13.040 --> 56:15.720]  gone on with the eugenics, Indian leaders, everybody.
[56:15.720 --> 56:17.460]  This is the global government.
[56:17.460 --> 56:21.360]  The people who rise to the top have agreed to the eugenics pack, agreed to the New World
[56:21.360 --> 56:23.240]  War, went along with the technocracy.
[56:23.240 --> 56:26.840]  Bloomberg talks about how much he uses data to rule over and make his decisions.
[56:26.840 --> 56:30.560]  No, tell people about that article. We're gonna get to more of that in the next hour,
[56:30.560 --> 56:34.080]  where he admits, I was ready for the next shooting. I'm gonna tell you what to drink,
[56:34.080 --> 56:37.040]  what to eat, cuz I care about you. I control you.
[56:37.040 --> 56:38.040]  Bizarre articles.
[56:38.040 --> 56:41.480]  Yeah, of course, they were waiting for the next tragedy, cuz that's all they can do is
[56:41.480 --> 56:42.840]  like vultures just waiting.
[56:42.840 --> 56:47.320]  Well, that's how within two minutes of all these events, they're on it. That's the sign.
[56:47.320 --> 56:51.340]  They're at the starting line. In fact, sometimes they jump the gun like Building 7, they report
[56:51.340 --> 56:53.080]  it had fallen before it did.
[56:53.080 --> 56:55.120]  Yeah, so they're always pushing our buttons.
[56:55.120 --> 56:57.200]  How do you jump the gun, Aaron?
[56:57.200 --> 56:59.160]  I don't know, because-
[56:59.160 --> 57:00.160]  How did they print?
[57:00.160 --> 57:01.160]  You just see it coming.
[57:01.160 --> 57:07.320]  How did they print Lee Harvey Oswald's photo and name in Asian and Australian newspapers
[57:07.320 --> 57:09.120]  hours before he was even arrested?
[57:09.120 --> 57:12.480]  How did they start showing bin Laden's face minutes after the towers fell?
[57:12.480 --> 57:16.360]  But it would mean they were having to do it.
[57:16.360 --> 57:18.120]  Oops, that's how the government started to figure it out.
[57:18.120 --> 57:23.760]  Well, that's racist, cuz you're talking about, I mean, he's Irish. Why are you racist?
[57:23.760 --> 57:26.880]  Yeah, you're right, I guess. Yeah, but the point is they're pushing her.
[57:26.880 --> 57:30.200]  Well, I mean, you don't want to turn your guns in? That's racist. You don't want a ham
[57:30.200 --> 57:31.800]  sandwich? I mean, that's evil.
[57:31.800 --> 57:36.320]  Well, they've driven up the race issue during Obama because that's his only cover, because
[57:36.320 --> 57:37.840]  everybody would be angry.
[57:37.840 --> 57:42.040]  No, they're in 10 African countries lining blacks up and shooting them, but that's liberal.
[57:42.040 --> 57:43.040]  But they won't talk on the telephone.
[57:43.040 --> 57:44.480]  Those are ugly black babies, though.
[57:44.480 --> 57:45.880]  About killing black people in Libya.
[57:45.880 --> 57:47.880]  Say black babies are ugly and you'll be a liberal.
[57:47.880 --> 57:50.000]  Yeah, well, I'm not going along with that genocide.
[57:50.000 --> 57:51.000]  The point is-
[57:51.000 --> 57:52.000]  So you're a racist.
[57:52.000 --> 57:53.000]  They're using that racial-
[57:53.000 --> 57:54.000]  God, you're a racist.
[57:54.000 --> 57:55.000]  Anytime-
[57:55.000 --> 57:58.600]  No, no, and that's why we need to talk about it with everybody, get it out in the open.
[57:58.600 --> 58:02.400]  People need to stop being uncomfortable about government sponsored terror, about deadly
[58:02.400 --> 58:03.400]  vaccines.
[58:03.400 --> 58:06.580]  They're trying to force those on us. We're all under attack. We've got to just get this
[58:06.580 --> 58:09.560]  out in the open. And if we want to kill each other later after we defeated the New World
[58:09.560 --> 58:14.200]  Order, that's fine. That's what you're into, whatever. But my thing is, that's why I can't
[58:14.200 --> 58:16.620]  stand all these race groups, white supremacist, all of them.
[58:16.620 --> 58:20.120]  They will never talk about eugenics. They will never talk about the real scientific
[58:20.120 --> 58:25.220]  technocracy. It's all Catholics are bad. Jews are bad. Blacks are bad. Mexicans are bad.
[58:25.220 --> 58:30.480]  It's always this group or that group runs it all. Or the, you know, the, the Masons,
[58:30.480 --> 58:36.200]  the reptoids, instead of how about systems of divide and conquer, systems of collectivization.
[58:36.200 --> 58:39.560]  Let's talk about Bloomberg. I actually have those articles when we come back.

[59:49.960 --> 01:00:05.680]  Waging war on corruption, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:05.680 --> 01:00:09.520]  Big brother, mainstream media, government coverage.
[01:00:09.520 --> 01:00:10.520]  You want answers?
[01:00:10.520 --> 01:00:11.520]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.520 --> 01:00:12.520]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:12.520 --> 01:00:13.520]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.520 --> 01:00:14.520]  He's Aaron Dikes.
[01:00:14.520 --> 01:00:16.520]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:16.520 --> 01:00:17.800]  Aaron Dikes is with us.
[01:00:17.800 --> 01:00:22.040]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:22.040 --> 01:00:25.640]  That's right. Monday through Friday, 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. I'm going to go to your calls coming
[01:00:25.640 --> 01:00:28.880]  up here in the next segment. And then later I will get more into this. But let's talk
[01:00:28.880 --> 01:00:34.480]  about it some right now. Actually looking around in my stack for it. You did a special
[01:00:34.480 --> 01:00:39.940]  report on it. Oh, you have it? The whole Bloomberg thing. I mean, talk about Bazaar. He comes
[01:00:39.940 --> 01:00:44.520]  out in newspapers and it's like, he cares so much. That's why he's going to run your
[01:00:44.520 --> 01:00:51.600]  life with data. And he's so smart. He's an idiot savant. And that's why he was premeditatedly
[01:00:51.600 --> 01:00:53.880]  waiting for the next shooting to get your guns.
[01:00:53.880 --> 01:00:59.480]  That leads me to Dianne Feinstein saying there will be, two weeks ago, there will be other
[01:00:59.480 --> 01:01:05.240]  events. She smiled. There will be other events. And we're going to get the guns. Mr. and Mrs.
[01:01:05.240 --> 01:01:09.400]  America get ready to turn him in. And they're just going to make it like Aaron, you go you
[01:01:09.400 --> 01:01:10.400]  own a gun.
[01:01:10.400 --> 01:01:13.360]  You kill the next person when there's always going to be death. There's always gonna be
[01:01:13.360 --> 01:01:18.840]  bad guys. It's the people, Aaron. Well, this gets into the whole Tavistock Institute issue,
[01:01:18.840 --> 01:01:22.800]  which is a whole another subject, but it's related. These psychologists throughout history
[01:01:22.800 --> 01:01:28.440]  from Germany, from Britain, for the last 150 years have gotten together, shared their research
[01:01:28.440 --> 01:01:31.160]  and figured out how can they use that hierarchy of needs?
[01:01:31.160 --> 01:01:37.460]  How can they use reward and punishment behaviorism to control the masses? They've applied it
[01:01:37.460 --> 01:01:41.640]  through people like Edward Bernays, who of course was related to Sigmund Freud through
[01:01:41.640 --> 01:01:46.440]  Carl Jung's findings, to keep people down, to punch their buttons. They've figured out
[01:01:46.440 --> 01:01:50.800]  how people are programmed, how they're likely to react, at least statistically.
[01:01:50.800 --> 01:01:55.020]  And they've learned to manipulate societies through it. Bloomberg, Bill Gates, these people
[01:01:55.020 --> 01:02:01.220]  are playing off of what the Fabian socialists did, Aldous Huxley, people in Skull and Bones.
[01:02:01.220 --> 01:02:08.040]  Which learned that from the first German proto-psychiatrist in the late 17, 1800s. But expanding on that,
[01:02:08.040 --> 01:02:12.400]  exactly, it's like a slow Loris attack with hacking. It's not so much a denial of service.
[01:02:12.400 --> 01:02:16.260]  It just keeps doing a master command over and over again. It just keeps asking, like
[01:02:16.260 --> 01:02:20.120]  extending the hand, but never shaking it. Like, shake my hand and then you comb your
[01:02:20.120 --> 01:02:21.120]  hair.
[01:02:21.120 --> 01:02:24.400]  It's like, hey, the black helicopters raided town today. No, they didn't. Yeah, it was
[01:02:24.400 --> 01:02:28.320]  on the news, we all saw it. No, we didn't, crazy. And then they gaslight and all go,
[01:02:28.320 --> 01:02:35.240]  you didn't see it, you didn't see it. There's no bullets, there's no. And you're like, well,
[01:02:35.240 --> 01:02:39.360]  yeah, it is. And it doesn't matter if you're informed to know the sheep go. And they'll
[01:02:39.360 --> 01:02:42.200]  start like a five-year-old laughing like, ha ha, you are wrong.
[01:02:42.200 --> 01:02:46.080]  If you have an elephant in your living room, and if David Rockefeller said it's not there,
[01:02:46.080 --> 01:02:50.360]  the general public go, it's not there, it's not there. I mean, it's like five-year-old
[01:02:50.360 --> 01:02:51.360]  behavior.
[01:02:51.360 --> 01:02:54.660]  Well, people get mad and call you racist for talking about Margaret Sanger's Negro Project
[01:02:54.660 --> 01:02:57.800]  and trying to buy off black. They'll go, that word's racist. Don't tell me they want to
[01:02:57.800 --> 01:03:02.280]  kill me. Racist, words are racist. They arrest people in England for saying homosexual.
[01:03:02.280 --> 01:03:03.280]  I know they do.
[01:03:03.280 --> 01:03:07.640]  Big word, Robin Page BBC. That's part of the behaviorism they're trying to push on us.
[01:03:07.640 --> 01:03:11.380]  But then you read Edward Bernays, I've actually read it. I know what he talks about, buying
[01:03:11.380 --> 01:03:15.640]  off leaders, buying off pastors, buying off magazine heads. So you can push your message
[01:03:15.640 --> 01:03:20.320]  top down and people will buy it because they're in splinter groups and they're into it.
[01:03:20.320 --> 01:03:24.800]  And it's peer pressure. The key is stop caring what people think. And then look at this study
[01:03:24.800 --> 01:03:29.800]  that they did in schools in the 60s, 70s, whatever. They took people with blonde hair,
[01:03:29.800 --> 01:03:32.980]  put them in one group. They said, today we're gonna do an exercise. You're blonde, you get
[01:03:32.980 --> 01:03:36.460]  on this side of the room. You're brown headed, the majority of the room, you get on this
[01:03:36.460 --> 01:03:37.620]  side of the room.
[01:03:37.620 --> 01:03:41.860]  And the brown headed people are gonna taunt and make fun of and put down the blonde haired
[01:03:41.860 --> 01:03:45.800]  people. They did this all day throughout the exercise. When the exercise is over, they
[01:03:45.800 --> 01:03:50.840]  flip it. They reward the blonde headed people with candy or treats or whatever and deny
[01:03:50.840 --> 01:03:56.000]  them to the brown headed people. So they then have, there's a cross referencing of denial
[01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:57.000]  of privilege.
[01:03:57.000 --> 01:04:02.720]  Pavlovian privilege. It's Pavlovian and Skinnerism explicitly. That's explicitly what they were
[01:04:02.720 --> 01:04:03.720]  doing in the class.
[01:04:03.720 --> 01:04:08.000]  And so get it folks, they're putting stuff in your water. They're killing all of us.
[01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:12.600]  And they're telling us whites are racist terrorists in the LA Times with straight faces because
[01:04:12.600 --> 01:04:18.640]  it says we imagine a world government that's all being announced. Financial Times, world
[01:04:18.640 --> 01:04:21.040]  government is here, run by banks.
[01:04:21.040 --> 01:04:26.560]  And now for world government, it's all, Davos, 100 trillion in taxpayer money in the next
[01:04:26.560 --> 01:04:31.280]  decade will fund our world government. They're exempt from taxes. You're like, maybe I was
[01:04:31.280 --> 01:04:32.720]  like, that's pretty racist.
[01:04:32.720 --> 01:04:37.020]  So you see how with the blonde brown hair example, it's a pushing of the button. It's
[01:04:37.020 --> 01:04:41.000]  a card they play in the deck of cards. Whenever people get mad about what Obama's doing against
[01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:44.920]  the Constitution, play the race card. It'll divide everyone. Everyone-
[01:04:44.920 --> 01:04:49.400]  Exactly, all it is is just, all it is is like wolves are chasing you, throw a bone over
[01:04:49.400 --> 01:04:52.800]  your shoulder. But it's not even a bone, it's a cyanide bone. And then people get to where
[01:04:52.800 --> 01:04:53.800]  they value it.
[01:04:53.800 --> 01:04:57.460]  The only thing they know is how to identify racially. And the globalists are the ones
[01:04:57.460 --> 01:05:01.400]  in the media that punch that, they have stimuli that they can respond to.
[01:05:01.400 --> 01:05:06.680]  You prepare by purchasing gold, food and firearms. But if you don't have a home security system,
[01:05:06.680 --> 01:05:11.500]  then you're missing a critical weapon in your arsenal for home protection. When you're sleeping

[01:08:19.080 --> 01:08:22.440]  from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:08:22.440 --> 01:08:31.200]  Hi, this is John Napolitano with the Office of Homeland Security. Our new Southern Poverty
[01:08:31.200 --> 01:08:36.400]  Law Center report says that white men with guns are the number one terror threat and
[01:08:36.400 --> 01:08:41.240]  just believing in a new world order conspiracy theory or the second coming of Christ is an
[01:08:41.240 --> 01:08:48.000]  act of terrorism. We are going to establish a task force to deal with all of you. Again,
[01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:54.080]  thank you for listening and remember, white people are terrorists unless you're a communist.
[01:08:54.080 --> 01:09:00.600]  Again, if you just joined us, ladies and gentlemen, I'm not joking. Peril from patriots, the US
[01:09:00.600 --> 01:09:06.520]  needs to keep a close watch on growing threat of homegrown extremist groups. And it goes
[01:09:06.520 --> 01:09:10.940]  on to say what can be done with the rise of the tide of belligerent ignorance? No, they're
[01:09:10.940 --> 01:09:18.280]  not jihadist. They're white, right-wing Americans, nearly all of which obsessively attach to
[01:09:18.280 --> 01:09:19.280]  guns.
[01:09:19.280 --> 01:09:22.920]  Nearly all that obsessive attachment to guns. See, they want us to have an obsessive attachment
[01:09:22.920 --> 01:09:28.760]  with race. They are scared at the obsessive attachment to individualism, obsessive attachment
[01:09:28.760 --> 01:09:33.880]  to family, obsessive attachment to private property, obsessive attachment to privacy,
[01:09:33.880 --> 01:09:39.000]  obsessive attachment to wealth that comes from freedom. They want you to be obsessed
[01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:43.960]  on race, and then they can tie that to socialism and collectivism, which the big mega banks
[01:09:43.960 --> 01:09:45.920]  have created because they're exempt from it all.
[01:09:45.920 --> 01:09:52.080]  Came out two days ago, more than, what was it, 15, 16 major companies? Hundreds of billions
[01:09:52.080 --> 01:09:57.080]  a piece, 108 billion, in fact, show viewers that. 108 million, General Electric has offshore
[01:09:57.080 --> 01:10:02.440]  tax-free. If you make a few million dollars, say you sell a restaurant or something, somebody
[01:10:02.440 --> 01:10:07.900]  that this happened to, went to main line lawyers, moved about a million dollars of it to a Caribbean
[01:10:07.900 --> 01:10:11.460]  main line island where they wanted to build a retirement home.
[01:10:11.460 --> 01:10:14.760]  The government just called it all illegal, even though it was after-tax money, and took
[01:10:14.760 --> 01:10:21.800]  it all. You're not gonna move a million dollars down to the Bahamas or to the Caribbean somewhere
[01:10:21.800 --> 01:10:26.280]  to live. You're not gonna move that into a Swiss bank after you even pay taxes, cuz you
[01:10:26.280 --> 01:10:27.760]  know they may take it later.
[01:10:27.760 --> 01:10:32.920]  They're putting currency and capital controls in. But if you are just one of their low-level
[01:10:32.920 --> 01:10:37.360]  minions, like Mitt Romney, you wanna have hundreds of millions offshore, go ahead, baby.
[01:10:37.360 --> 01:10:38.360]  Go ahead, baby.
[01:10:38.360 --> 01:10:43.800]  Yeah, just type 108 billion offshore, General Electric. It's AP, International Business
[01:10:43.800 --> 01:10:49.200]  Times, Business Insider. We showed it yesterday. Everybody saw it. The point is, Aaron Dykes,
[01:10:49.200 --> 01:10:53.600]  I'm gonna go to calls here, but you were getting into now, through AmeriCorps, which they're
[01:10:53.600 --> 01:10:56.000]  saying you're gonna have to have to get out of high school or college.
[01:10:56.000 --> 01:11:00.260]  You've gotta wear white bracelets, and read that. Wear a quote minority, that's the new
[01:11:00.260 --> 01:11:06.280]  God class, but not really. Since you survived abortion and type 2 diabetes and all their
[01:11:06.280 --> 01:11:10.400]  chemical weapons now, you'll be used as cannon fodder to henpeck people, because of their
[01:11:10.400 --> 01:11:11.920]  guilt will be receptive.
[01:11:11.920 --> 01:11:16.360]  Okay, I'll do whatever you say, teach me how I'm bad, so you'll learn to, okay, I only
[01:11:16.360 --> 01:11:21.640]  identify as a group. See, it's not about, it's the opposite of what Martin Luther King
[01:11:21.640 --> 01:11:26.360]  said, not the color of skin, but the character of your deeds. I mean, this is wild mind control.
[01:11:26.360 --> 01:11:30.520]  Aaron, the whole office is asking, will we wear bracelets saying we're bad?
[01:11:30.520 --> 01:11:35.880]  Well, I don't know, but it's so weird and so far beyond the idea of can't we all just
[01:11:35.880 --> 01:11:40.800]  get along or something like that. It's write notes to yourself every day, reminding yourself
[01:11:40.800 --> 01:11:45.880]  of your white privilege. Wear a white wristband to honor your privilege, and as a personal
[01:11:45.880 --> 01:11:49.320]  commitment to explain why you wear the wristband.
[01:11:49.320 --> 01:11:53.840]  Find a person of color willing to hold you accountable for addressing your white privilege.
[01:11:53.840 --> 01:11:58.080]  And it's so creepy, think about it. They send people from these schools, from these volunteer
[01:11:58.080 --> 01:12:02.860]  groups to the White Privilege Conference. That document's over here with the slogan
[01:12:02.860 --> 01:12:07.300]  got privilege. And they get you to get up on stage with people who probably are your
[01:12:07.300 --> 01:12:09.000]  black friends or your Hispanic friends.
[01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:12.680]  And these people use it as a political weapon. And then again, the Hispanics, blacks and
[01:12:12.680 --> 01:12:17.480]  others, they associate their new power with the state that dictates all this. See the
[01:12:17.480 --> 01:12:21.160]  Pavlovian stimulus, you're the dog in the cage, they ring the bell, they give you the
[01:12:21.160 --> 01:12:26.840]  meat. You feel powerful when you grovel, they feel power when they say, La Reconquista,
[01:12:26.840 --> 01:12:28.360]  which is all funded by Ford Foundation.
[01:12:28.360 --> 01:12:32.200]  Cuz the last thing they want is for people to embrace the Bill of Rights Constitution
[01:12:32.200 --> 01:12:33.200]  as a unifier.
[01:12:33.200 --> 01:12:37.680]  They wanna erase the rights and they never wanna talk about how the way that people stay
[01:12:37.680 --> 01:12:42.740]  downtrodden is by getting dependent on government welfare handouts. Why? Because then they can
[01:12:42.740 --> 01:12:45.560]  tell you whether or not you're gonna have that baby, whether or not you're gonna get
[01:12:45.560 --> 01:12:47.240]  that abortion, how you're never gonna-
[01:12:47.240 --> 01:12:51.140]  How you're gonna get hundreds of vaccines now and wonder why you get cancer and both
[01:12:51.140 --> 01:12:53.000]  your legs sawed off of diabetes.
[01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:55.880]  Why is all this happening? Well, it's in their own manuals, they're killing you, but they're
[01:12:55.880 --> 01:13:03.160]  liberal. Hi, I'm wearing sandals, give you the shot, you have a nice day now. Ugly black
[01:13:03.160 --> 01:13:08.080]  baby, just like the liberals say, let's kill the black babies, and that's liberal.
[01:13:08.080 --> 01:13:10.280]  It's creepy, and you've got some of the top black leaders-
[01:13:10.280 --> 01:13:12.480]  Admit killing black babies is liberal.
[01:13:12.480 --> 01:13:14.600]  No, it's liberal like Hitler liberal.
[01:13:14.600 --> 01:13:18.240]  No, no, he was liberal, he was a national socialist. Admit you were wrong and agree
[01:13:18.240 --> 01:13:19.240]  with that abortionist.
[01:13:19.240 --> 01:13:22.640]  They're saying that Nazism is national socialism, that's racism too.
[01:13:22.640 --> 01:13:24.960]  I know, they actually say that.
[01:13:24.960 --> 01:13:28.520]  You have to wear the white bracelet like Jews had to wear the yellow star, but if you talk
[01:13:28.520 --> 01:13:29.840]  bad about it, that's racist.
[01:13:29.840 --> 01:13:33.320]  Well, and if your mom makes a pastry that looks like a gun, wasn't even a gun, you're
[01:13:33.320 --> 01:13:37.960]  gonna be kicked out of school. And if somebody pulls a gun on a bus, well, it's meant to
[01:13:37.960 --> 01:13:41.360]  just be whatever crazy order we give you. I've explained Marine Corps brainwashing,
[01:13:41.360 --> 01:13:44.520]  they don't do it anymore because it was too bizarre.
[01:13:44.520 --> 01:13:48.160]  And it did create, it was a Prussian model of brainwashing, they developed the shaved
[01:13:48.160 --> 01:13:49.160]  head, the soldiers-
[01:13:49.160 --> 01:13:50.240]  That's where the psychology comes from.
[01:13:50.240 --> 01:13:54.880]  No, the lack of sleep, yeah, exactly. The Prussians had the best German slaves to sell,
[01:13:54.880 --> 01:14:01.400]  the white military slaves, Prussian Hessians. Well, they both came from both places, but
[01:14:01.400 --> 01:14:02.920]  the point is a sub-district.
[01:14:02.920 --> 01:14:08.240]  And if you look at that, and if you look at what they did, again, it's the same thing
[01:14:08.240 --> 01:14:09.240]  happening today.
[01:14:09.240 --> 01:14:15.440]  Yeah, it is, and this is just weird brainwashing. This is not gonna foster respect between different
[01:14:15.440 --> 01:14:19.880]  communities. This is only gonna create new weird thoughts in people like wearing a white
[01:14:19.880 --> 01:14:24.560]  wristband and now, but they're doing this to teachers. I forgot the whole source wasn't
[01:14:24.560 --> 01:14:29.240]  even CNS News, who always break great stuff, it was some other group, I'm sorry, I don't
[01:14:29.240 --> 01:14:30.240]  remember their name.
[01:14:30.240 --> 01:14:34.360]  They're doing a whole documentary on how the teachers in Wisconsin are being brainwashed
[01:14:34.360 --> 01:14:38.720]  to deal with their white privilege and how they're not ready to teach minority students
[01:14:38.720 --> 01:14:45.280]  until they admit and come to terms with the shame of being white. How weird is that?
[01:14:45.280 --> 01:14:47.600]  And they're teaching everywhere, there's no free speech, but getting back to the Marine
[01:14:47.600 --> 01:14:53.360]  brainwashing, I'm not attacking Marines themselves. The point is it's German military technology,
[01:14:53.360 --> 01:14:58.600]  that's a fact, go look it up, from a group selling soldiers, selling shiploads of soldiers
[01:14:58.600 --> 01:15:01.600]  anywhere in the world who were so brainwashed they were happy to be slaves.
[01:15:01.600 --> 01:15:05.880]  I mean, that's mind control, that's kindergarten. All of this stuff comes out of the Prussian
[01:15:05.880 --> 01:15:09.320]  mind control model, skull and bones, everything as you said, they brag about this. We're giving
[01:15:09.320 --> 01:15:14.560]  you the history of this, the guts of this, where it all came from. But that's why when
[01:15:14.560 --> 01:15:18.360]  you see, they hired that former real Marine Corps drill sergeant, most of that was impromptu
[01:15:18.360 --> 01:15:23.200]  at Stanley Kubrick's Full Metal Jacket where they're walking around grabbing their genitals
[01:15:23.200 --> 01:15:28.080]  in really a sexual ceremony saying, this is my rifle, this is my gun, this is for fighting,
[01:15:28.080 --> 01:15:29.440]  this is for fun.
[01:15:29.440 --> 01:15:34.720]  And they taught them sexual Pavlovian connection to the rifle, so that there would actually
[01:15:34.720 --> 01:15:39.480]  be a sexual hormone release in the brain, pre-sexual, I forget the name of the exact
[01:15:39.480 --> 01:15:44.920]  hormone. But the ancients knew this as well, the ninjas used sex to train people in Japan
[01:15:44.920 --> 01:15:49.040]  to go train for ten years to be an assassin, go kill your target, then commit sepia kill
[01:15:49.040 --> 01:15:52.600]  yourself like a kamikaze so that no one can find out who hired the killer.
[01:15:52.600 --> 01:15:56.520]  I mean, just with sex, they train people to kill. It's like they can train Muslims to
[01:15:56.520 --> 01:16:01.200]  blow themselves up thinking it's for Allah, you don't just need drugs for mind control.
[01:16:01.200 --> 01:16:06.180]  But that's what it's all about, is that they create a Pavlovian connection to it. So it's
[01:16:06.180 --> 01:16:11.240]  a Pavlovian trigger where you go, I don't think I want troops on the street racist.
[01:16:11.240 --> 01:16:17.660]  I don't think I want socialism racist. Guns are racist, what's your argument? There is
[01:16:17.660 --> 01:16:22.600]  not racist, and they smile. They're literally psych warfare chiefs who know they're psych
[01:16:22.600 --> 01:16:28.280]  warfare chiefs. Most of these even mid-level liberals are actually fascist, exterminous
[01:16:28.280 --> 01:16:31.200]  eugenicists. They don't just wanna kill black people, they wanna kill everybody.
[01:16:31.200 --> 01:16:35.520]  It's like when my dad got called in because he was top of his class at UT. Because he
[01:16:35.520 --> 01:16:38.880]  was in all these national science programs and giving science speeches and all this other
[01:16:38.880 --> 01:16:41.560]  stuff, so he was on the fast track in all this. People say, well, then why if he was
[01:16:41.560 --> 01:16:45.720]  doing particle acceleration when he was 16, did he get out of it? Because he had freaked
[01:16:45.720 --> 01:16:49.160]  him out, and then he just went and got the fastest track to making money being a dentist.
[01:16:49.160 --> 01:16:54.120]  My mom got pregnant in college. But to make a long story short on all this, he was building
[01:16:54.120 --> 01:16:58.040]  particle beams when he was 16 with government grants, cuz they knew most stuff was being
[01:16:58.040 --> 01:16:59.800]  developed in garages.
[01:16:59.800 --> 01:17:03.280]  But I told that story a few days ago, people couldn't believe it, cuz they just don't know
[01:17:03.280 --> 01:17:06.480]  how. They can't even imagine I snuck into Bohemian Grove. They don't think this show's
[01:17:06.480 --> 01:17:09.760]  real. Aaron, they don't think you operate on your own. They don't think you have any
[01:17:09.760 --> 01:17:11.940]  individual power.
[01:17:11.940 --> 01:17:17.580]  It's not just the race divide. This collectivism, the general public's never done anything outside
[01:17:17.580 --> 01:17:23.680]  of a system. They don't know what they can do. They have no idea that the guy that started
[01:17:23.680 --> 01:17:27.560]  Nike tennis shoes made him out of the back of a car and sold it on the street. They don't
[01:17:27.560 --> 01:17:31.840]  know that the guy that created Paul Mitchell, tens of millions of dollars, created himself
[01:17:31.840 --> 01:17:33.100]  when he was homeless.
[01:17:33.100 --> 01:17:37.800]  They literally can't believe you're doing anything. It must all be fake. We must be
[01:17:37.800 --> 01:17:42.040]  government agents, because nothing can be real. But the side issue, when they called
[01:17:42.040 --> 01:17:48.440]  my dad in, when he was still in high school, a junior when he was brought to UT to be tested
[01:17:48.440 --> 01:17:49.440]  with all these kids.
[01:17:49.440 --> 01:17:53.080]  And then he was, out of hundreds, just the few they brought in. And it was, we're gonna
[01:17:53.080 --> 01:17:56.840]  carry out eugenics, you're the elite, do you like that idea? And by the way, this isn't
[01:17:56.840 --> 01:18:01.620]  like Hitler. The head of the body department was running it. Professor Spear, I'm Jewish,
[01:18:01.620 --> 01:18:03.100]  he said, this isn't like Hitler.
[01:18:03.100 --> 01:18:08.800]  We're going after everybody that's inferior. My dad was like, but he still went to UT later,
[01:18:08.800 --> 01:18:11.840]  but then got out of all that. He was never really in it, but it was, well, you went there,
[01:18:11.840 --> 01:18:12.840]  you know about it.
[01:18:12.840 --> 01:18:18.160]  Yeah, and looking back at UT, there's a lot of creepy professors and agendas going on.
[01:18:18.160 --> 01:18:22.400]  But they always co-opt the leaders. They've done that in the black community, talking
[01:18:22.400 --> 01:18:27.000]  about race issues. And it's hurtful, I guess, to talk about for some people, but they have
[01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:28.120]  sold out some of the top-
[01:18:28.120 --> 01:18:32.160]  Well, no, they create a pain. They bring it up so that you can't live your new life. So
[01:18:32.160 --> 01:18:36.200]  I can't be somebody free of guilt. Somebody who's another color can't be free of guilt
[01:18:36.200 --> 01:18:41.420]  and be a real human. It's a prison, a neurotic prison where you say a key word and someone
[01:18:41.420 --> 01:18:47.260]  falls into a trance. I mean, that's why they use it. I mean, it's a weapon. And I know
[01:18:47.260 --> 01:18:48.760]  I've gone fully off into this.
[01:18:48.760 --> 01:18:54.120]  We got calls and a bunch of news coming up. It's just such mind control. Listen, did our
[01:18:54.120 --> 01:18:57.680]  predictions not come true? They're now saying whites just being white is terrorism and whites
[01:18:57.680 --> 01:19:00.880]  are gonna blow everything up and Homeland Security's new op ought to be against white
[01:19:00.880 --> 01:19:01.880]  gun owners.
[01:19:01.880 --> 01:19:05.240]  Why were you able to predict it? Because you've read history, because you follow the news,
[01:19:05.240 --> 01:19:07.600]  the stuff follows patterns, it follows archetypes.
[01:19:07.600 --> 01:19:11.360]  We could see the programming. And it's a prison of the mind. As soon as you begin to look
[01:19:11.360 --> 01:19:15.360]  into it for yourself and read stuff, you'll begin to get out of that prison, see things
[01:19:15.360 --> 01:19:20.260]  for yourself and become a stronger individual. And realize your identity, your purpose is
[01:19:20.260 --> 01:19:22.240]  not in the collective system.
[01:19:22.240 --> 01:19:26.440]  That is a dying system. And they want us all to die because they wanna take the power,
[01:19:26.440 --> 01:19:30.640]  they wanna suck it mentally, psychically out of us. And we don't need to give in to that.
[01:19:30.640 --> 01:19:34.600]  I don't wanna live in the world they're building. They plan to kill 99% of us. Their public
[01:19:34.600 --> 01:19:39.680]  documents are 90, cuz their minions would freak out if they realized it, the math. This
[01:19:39.680 --> 01:19:44.240]  eugenics cult, if you had to estimate its numbers, I bet there's probably 50 million
[01:19:44.240 --> 01:19:47.640]  people that know they're in on it, but have reflected glory.
[01:19:47.640 --> 01:19:51.320]  They're not really in on it. There's only a few thousand in on it. And I'd say almost
[01:19:51.320 --> 01:19:56.240]  every liberal I talk to mid-level, they know. They know they're an exterminist. They're
[01:19:56.240 --> 01:20:00.400]  beyond race. They're scientists. They are programming us. Aaron, thank you very much.
[01:20:00.400 --> 01:20:01.400]  Thanks.

[01:22:40.120 --> 01:22:43.900]  was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the public currency is a greater
[01:22:43.900 --> 01:22:47.560]  menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army? Hi, Ted Anderson. I'm placing

[01:24:06.880 --> 01:24:10.200]  teeth against us and Michael Moore, you know, came out yesterday and said how to finish
[01:24:10.200 --> 01:24:15.640]  off the NRA's The Quote. Show photos of the dead kids, Sandy Hook. You know, it was three
[01:24:15.640 --> 01:24:21.560]  days before Diane Feinstein came out and said, I've seen the photos. I know details and did
[01:24:21.560 --> 01:24:22.560]  that demonic smirk.
[01:24:22.560 --> 01:24:26.440]  I mean, that woman is so overtly evil. I mean, looks like the Goblin King or something. I
[01:24:26.440 --> 01:24:31.040]  mean, just pure evil and her actions are pure evil. You guys need to kill that mic. Thanks.
[01:24:31.040 --> 01:24:37.240]  That mic's on over there. Are you? Yeah. Anyways, getting back to what I was saying there. This
[01:24:37.240 --> 01:24:44.160]  is just overwhelming. What's going on? And they're not going to show dead kids killed
[01:24:44.160 --> 01:24:47.840]  by governments. They're not going to show the communist Chinese who have the guns mowing
[01:24:47.840 --> 01:24:49.080]  down people in mass.
[01:24:49.080 --> 01:24:53.580]  You can type in communist Chinese executions. It's on Google on the photos. Unbelievable
[01:24:53.580 --> 01:24:56.760]  young people having their heads blown off. Men, women, children. They're not going to
[01:24:56.760 --> 01:25:00.380]  show any of that. That's why they always say Hitler wasn't for gun control. Don't show
[01:25:00.380 --> 01:25:05.000]  people being shot by Hitler. Hitler wasn't for gun control because they know that's powerful.
[01:25:05.000 --> 01:25:09.120]  Seeing gun control victims. They're going to bring out the little dead kids that were
[01:25:09.120 --> 01:25:10.840]  probably killed by black ops teams.
[01:25:10.840 --> 01:25:15.400]  There's major evidence. And this just shows how vicious they are. This is their psych
[01:25:15.400 --> 01:25:19.780]  warfare. And they're testing to see if this will work for them. Or they'll just stage
[01:25:19.780 --> 01:25:26.560]  another one. So good job, killers. And your little front men. Just unbelievable. I want
[01:25:26.560 --> 01:25:30.380]  Michael Moore to be wrong about new time crime scene photos.
[01:25:30.380 --> 01:25:35.720]  That's just some of the photos. You must not look away. And he's on the news right now
[01:25:35.720 --> 01:25:39.800]  during the break saying, hey, we're going to release these photos and we're going to
[01:25:39.800 --> 01:25:45.720]  show you. Hey, let's release the crime scene photos. The little black kid got shot by the
[01:25:45.720 --> 01:25:52.400]  police the other day. Oh, you don't want that because that's real government violence. Unbelievable.
[01:25:52.400 --> 01:25:55.480]  And they also want to have laws to not show dead aborted babies. They don't want you to
[01:25:55.480 --> 01:26:00.720]  see who they're chopping up. Man, these people are sick. These people are sick.
[01:26:00.720 --> 01:26:03.800]  Let's talk to Brian in Canada. Let's talk about divide and conquer. Thanks for holding
[01:26:03.800 --> 01:26:04.800]  her on the air.
[01:26:04.800 --> 01:26:11.160]  Alex, love you to death. And I've been giddy ever since you appeared on Piers Morgan show
[01:26:11.160 --> 01:26:15.920]  in early January. It was one of those striking TV moments. So I love you. I've been listening
[01:26:15.920 --> 01:26:22.240]  to you since 1996 on shortwave radio. So I am a fan. But what I've come to decide after
[01:26:22.240 --> 01:26:28.640]  listening to you the last couple of days is that you, Alex, use this divide and conquer
[01:26:28.640 --> 01:26:35.840]  strategy so effectively as part of the info war that it's starting to kind of bug me because
[01:26:35.840 --> 01:26:40.880]  while you talk about the globalists using divide and conquer strategies, and I know
[01:26:40.880 --> 01:26:46.360]  they do, you have perfected it, my man, to the point where, again, it's so it's become
[01:26:46.360 --> 01:26:54.160]  so obvious that you use this same identical strategy, fear, divide and conquer.
[01:26:54.160 --> 01:26:59.560]  You know, I disagree with you. There are fake memes put out there. I push fear. That is
[01:26:59.560 --> 01:27:04.880]  your perception. I mean, if something's already coming down on you knowing about it, when
[01:27:04.880 --> 01:27:09.640]  bad news comes to the office or something like that, I want it immediately. Okay, I
[01:27:09.640 --> 01:27:14.080]  want to face it head on. I don't want to ignore it.
[01:27:14.080 --> 01:27:17.920]  So it's a perception issue because I'm not here trying to manipulate. I'm here letting
[01:27:17.920 --> 01:27:22.660]  it all hang out, out of control, obviously, stream of consciousness. And so if you take
[01:27:22.660 --> 01:27:27.200]  it as fear, that's your issue. And that is a problem with my articulation, but nobody's
[01:27:27.200 --> 01:27:30.480]  perfect. Now, on the subject of divide and conquer, I want to hear how I'm dividing and
[01:27:30.480 --> 01:27:31.480]  conquering.
[01:27:31.480 --> 01:27:36.560]  But I've always said this. You're not listening. The very nature of having to respond to their
[01:27:36.560 --> 01:27:41.320]  divide and conquer and having to describe it will create divide and conquer. So even
[01:27:41.320 --> 01:27:45.920]  though I'm against racial division, which I call tribalism, the globalists call it that,
[01:27:45.920 --> 01:27:51.320]  because it's mindless and it's used as a tool by the mega elite to control, okay, still
[01:27:51.320 --> 01:27:55.580]  it's real when someone, if you're a black guy walking down the street and white guys
[01:27:55.580 --> 01:28:00.160]  get in your face, or if you're a white guy and it happens, okay, and I've experienced
[01:28:00.160 --> 01:28:02.160]  racial attacks, man.
[01:28:02.160 --> 01:28:07.480]  I mean, I didn't think of it as that. I saw it as gang. Instinctively, as a teenager,
[01:28:07.480 --> 01:28:11.480]  I knew I'd had groups of, we didn't call them rednecks, and I was kind of one myself, but
[01:28:11.480 --> 01:28:15.560]  we called them crap kickers, well, actually a cuss word. Cowboy hats, boots, you go to
[01:28:15.560 --> 01:28:18.320]  the wrong party, they'd say, where are you, we're going to beat you up.
[01:28:18.320 --> 01:28:22.000]  It's just whatever reason, that culture, it was fights every day. And I'd go to the neighborhood
[01:28:22.000 --> 01:28:25.600]  to play football or basketball with friends, there'd be some other black guys there, who's
[01:28:25.600 --> 01:28:28.880]  these white guys, let's have a fight. And there'd be a couple of my black buddies fighting
[01:28:28.880 --> 01:28:35.760]  some other black guys. I saw it always as tribal and as gang related, as people in gang
[01:28:35.760 --> 01:28:36.760]  mentalities.
[01:28:36.760 --> 01:28:41.620]  I mean, I'd be at a Dairy Queen when visiting my grandma when I was 16 down in East Texas
[01:28:41.620 --> 01:28:46.040]  and we'd be talking to girls in there trying to get them to go swimming with us, skinny
[01:28:46.040 --> 01:28:50.720]  dipping or something. And two trucks pull up and white guys jump out and go, we're gonna
[01:28:50.720 --> 01:28:54.680]  kick your ass, Yankee.
[01:28:54.680 --> 01:28:59.720]  Even though I wasn't from up north, they use that tribal identification, even though my
[01:28:59.720 --> 01:29:05.200]  family in that area founded the county. So I just instinctively had the programming of
[01:29:05.200 --> 01:29:12.680]  a real human to understand tribalism. There were black groups in Roman legions that invaded
[01:29:12.680 --> 01:29:17.840]  white areas. And believe me, the white people being invaded by legions that had blacks in
[01:29:17.840 --> 01:29:22.040]  some of them who were Roman citizens, they didn't think that's a black guy, the race
[01:29:22.040 --> 01:29:23.420]  didn't even exist.
[01:29:23.420 --> 01:29:27.200]  It was what country or tribe you were in and who you were allied with. I mean, does that
[01:29:27.200 --> 01:29:28.200]  answer your question?
[01:29:28.200 --> 01:29:33.360]  Sure, yeah. And again, forgive me from calling from multicultural candidates.
[01:29:33.360 --> 01:29:38.080]  I tell you what, I'm gonna come back to you. I'm gonna come back to you to try to understand
[01:29:38.080 --> 01:29:45.480]  all I have is my word and my, well, you know what Tony Montana says. And so I have no guilt.
[01:29:45.480 --> 01:29:50.520]  I'm a really good guy. I'm trying to free humanity. Okay. So take it how you want it.
[01:29:50.520 --> 01:30:01.000]  We're on the march. The empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[01:30:01.000 --> 01:30:06.000]  A little over a year ago, I began to do a lot of research into why, even if I had a
[01:30:06.000 --> 01:30:10.680]  good sized meal, that I was still starving. And my research led me to a well known fact
[01:30:10.680 --> 01:30:14.920]  that most of the soils that we grow our crops on here in the United States and across the
[01:30:14.920 --> 01:30:20.320]  industrialized world are almost completely depleted of almost all of the key minerals
[01:30:20.320 --> 01:30:25.640]  and trace elements that our bodies need to rebuild themselves, fight off cancer and be
[01:30:25.640 --> 01:30:26.640]  healthy.
[01:30:26.640 --> 01:30:32.360]  I then searched out the best vitamin and mineral company out there and discovered Young Jevity.

[01:33:09.160 --> 01:33:16.160]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:16.160 --> 01:33:23.160]  All right, we're going back to one quick phone call and then we've got a special guest, surprise
[01:33:23.160 --> 01:33:30.160]  guest here in studio in just one moment. Brian, in Canada, you said I used a vicious divide
[01:33:30.160 --> 01:33:37.160]  and conquer. And so explain to me, no, I explained divide and conquer, show hypocrisy and then
[01:33:54.640 --> 01:33:56.640]  try to get people to think outside the box.
[01:33:56.640 --> 01:34:01.800]  That's my intent. My intent is not to create fear. My intent is, hey, there's a hurricane
[01:34:01.800 --> 01:34:06.080]  coming. You better put boards up on your house instead of like, don't fear monger. I'm like,
[01:34:06.080 --> 01:34:09.880]  no, it's going 200 miles an hour. It's probably gonna knock out all your windows. Shut up,
[01:34:09.880 --> 01:34:10.880]  fear monger.
[01:34:10.880 --> 01:34:14.480]  I'm like, okay, I just said it was on the news. You might wanna put some, it's gonna
[01:34:14.480 --> 01:34:21.480]  hit tomorrow night. plywood selling out down at Home Depot. Shut up, racist. What are you
[01:34:21.480 --> 01:34:28.040]  implying? I need you to menial labor or something. I mean, I had a story I'll tell later when
[01:34:28.040 --> 01:34:30.800]  I was at Moody Gardens.
[01:34:30.800 --> 01:34:33.360]  Somebody thought I was saying something about them. And I could tell they were mad at me
[01:34:33.360 --> 01:34:36.240]  and I didn't know what they were. And then later it clicked. And it's just political
[01:34:36.240 --> 01:34:41.680]  correctness is about getting everybody freaked out, looking for things that don't exist or
[01:34:41.680 --> 01:34:47.480]  exaggerating them, and then missing the big giant stuff going on all around you.
[01:34:47.480 --> 01:34:51.520]  The real discrimination of the globalists that we pay $85 billion a month to. We're
[01:34:51.520 --> 01:34:55.920]  gonna be talking about that with our special guest here in just a moment. So it's just
[01:34:55.920 --> 01:34:59.640]  classic divide and conquer. I know I've harped on that, but they're going into race war,
[01:34:59.640 --> 01:35:04.520]  race pimp, overdrive, just to create fear and division so the government can play the
[01:35:04.520 --> 01:35:09.400]  part of the arbiter, of the referee, of the divide and conquer group.
[01:35:09.400 --> 01:35:16.220]  Of the good guy, of the mommy. President Obama, Chris Rock said, is our daddy. So let's go
[01:35:16.220 --> 01:35:20.340]  ahead and go back to Brian. Brian, tell me how I fear monger, or tell me how I divide
[01:35:20.340 --> 01:35:21.340]  and conquer.
[01:35:21.340 --> 01:35:23.800]  I mean, again, I don't want to upset you, Alex.
[01:35:23.800 --> 01:35:27.040]  You're not upsetting me. Tell me, please, please. I really want to know.
[01:35:27.040 --> 01:35:32.440]  Listen, I will, I will. All I'm saying is I think that the entire production team sits
[01:35:32.440 --> 01:35:38.000]  around probably and says, what can we talk about? And underlying all of that is how can
[01:35:38.000 --> 01:35:44.040]  we be provocative? How can we stir the emotion, which is a human circumstance, and I'm not-
[01:35:44.040 --> 01:35:49.560]  You just misrepresented. Well, what really goes on is out of all this real sensational
[01:35:49.560 --> 01:35:54.040]  stuff going on, what are we going to cover?
[01:35:54.040 --> 01:35:59.040]  And how do we hijack mindless cultural memes that don't matter and attach reality to them?
[01:35:59.040 --> 01:36:03.040]  That's culture jamming, culture hijacking. We don't have enough of those meetings. 90
[01:36:03.040 --> 01:36:06.320]  plus percent of the time, my crew does whatever they want cuz I hired folks that I overall
[01:36:06.320 --> 01:36:10.140]  trust and just get it and know what's going on.
[01:36:10.140 --> 01:36:15.440]  And sometimes I go, this isn't sensational enough, because we tend to water down our
[01:36:15.440 --> 01:36:21.960]  headlines. I mean, Aaron Dykes in an article said, has political correctness gone too far
[01:36:21.960 --> 01:36:26.160]  making whites wear white bracelets? I mean, I didn't call Aaron, I'm doing it now, does
[01:36:26.160 --> 01:36:27.160]  a great job.
[01:36:27.160 --> 01:36:32.800]  It's worse than that. It's totally creating a color obsessed society instead of a color
[01:36:32.800 --> 01:36:39.880]  blind society. I mean, it's the opposite, okay? And my gosh, I mean, no, you're wrong
[01:36:39.880 --> 01:36:46.840]  about how we run things up here. Okay, I cannot describe how crazy things are, sir. I mean,
[01:36:46.840 --> 01:36:48.460]  do you wanna know about the 2 billion bullets?
[01:36:48.460 --> 01:36:52.480]  How is that fear mongering? That's really going on. And I always get to get the criticism
[01:36:52.480 --> 01:36:56.240]  first, because I mean, look, I told you Piers Morgan, a bunch of his colleagues have been
[01:36:56.240 --> 01:37:01.680]  arrested. Now the five people under him were arrested today, okay? I mean, Piers Morgan
[01:37:01.680 --> 01:37:05.800]  is a gangster. And it doesn't feel good to be a gangster for my position.
[01:37:05.800 --> 01:37:10.600]  But I don't wanna be a gangster, but he wants to be a gangster, okay? I mean, I'm here straight
[01:37:10.600 --> 01:37:15.400]  shooting, show me money, show me the proof, show me the fear mongering, show me the divide
[01:37:15.400 --> 01:37:24.800]  and conquer. Show me, show me, show me, show me, come on. He hung up, he dropped off, show
[01:37:24.800 --> 01:37:29.360]  me, show me, show me.
[01:37:29.360 --> 01:37:34.400]  I mean, my wife ran in and said, there's guys breaking in the garage. I would say, my gosh,
[01:37:34.400 --> 01:37:39.000]  you fear monger. I'd say, thank you, maybe jump up, boom, into the instant access pistol
[01:37:39.000 --> 01:37:46.160]  safe. Semi-auto shotgun, locked, loaded. I mean, the way I get fired up, probably kicked
[01:37:46.160 --> 01:37:47.160]  down the garage door.
[01:37:47.160 --> 01:37:54.560]  And if you don't hit the ground in about two seconds, you're dead. I mean, I just don't
[01:37:54.560 --> 01:38:00.080]  get it. They've actually been people nowadays, they're in such denial that a neighbor will
[01:38:00.080 --> 01:38:03.480]  call and say your house is on fire and people get mad at them and deny it. There's a real
[01:38:03.480 --> 01:38:04.480]  culture of denial.
[01:38:04.480 --> 01:38:07.920]  Ladies and gentlemen, I didn't plug any products last hour, that's how we fund ourselves. Plus
[01:38:07.920 --> 01:38:13.400]  I picked the very best products out there. I'm not fear mongering, hydrofluorosolic acid
[01:38:13.400 --> 01:38:19.440]  is not linked, it's been confirmed by 20 Harvard studies. It just came out last year, just
[01:38:19.440 --> 01:38:23.600]  type in Harvard study and then it's 20, guys, type that in.
[01:38:23.600 --> 01:38:28.320]  Sevenfold increase in cancer, there were literally hundreds of studies on the same subject all
[01:38:28.320 --> 01:38:35.520]  over the world. A hundred, ladies and gentlemen, listen to me carefully. There are hundreds
[01:38:35.520 --> 01:38:37.920]  and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds, probably in the thousands of studies.
[01:38:37.920 --> 01:38:41.440]  I mean, there's like a couple of hundred Chinese studies alone, hundreds of Japanese, hundreds
[01:38:41.440 --> 01:38:42.440]  of American.
[01:38:42.440 --> 01:38:45.880]  Sevenfold increase in one type of bone cancer, every other cancer off the chart when they
[01:38:45.880 --> 01:38:49.600]  test them. And these are human studies where they've been able to track what water they're
[01:38:49.600 --> 01:38:56.640]  drinking because of it, because they have demographics on that. Brain cancers, diabetes,
[01:38:56.640 --> 01:39:04.560]  sclerosis, kidney failure, Harvard study finds fluoride lowers IQ and then it goes into all
[01:39:04.560 --> 01:39:06.960]  the cancer and the rest of it, boom, Reuters.
[01:39:06.960 --> 01:39:13.340]  You might wanna listen to me. But that's fear mongering, no, win, win, win. I sell the best
[01:39:13.340 --> 01:39:17.480]  gravity fed filters at the lowest price that then funds my operation or everybody else,
[01:39:17.480 --> 01:39:22.920]  called win, win, win, win, win, win, win, win, win. My gold sponsor, one of the few
[01:39:22.920 --> 01:39:27.360]  A+, better business bureaus, even the biggest companies, go look it up.
[01:39:27.360 --> 01:39:32.120]  There's hardly any other gold companies that have even an A rating. I can't find one that
[01:39:32.120 --> 01:39:36.560]  has an A+, cuz we get all these offers constantly and we get offers in the magazine. I can't
[01:39:36.560 --> 01:39:42.960]  ever find a reputable gold company to be a sponsor, cuz Ted is my exclusive on the radio,
[01:39:42.960 --> 01:39:46.080]  but I don't have a rule to do that.
[01:39:46.080 --> 01:39:50.360]  But I mean, he's the only guy that's A+. He's been around 30 years, 16 with his company
[01:39:50.360 --> 01:39:54.600]  Midas. I've known the guy for 17 years. He came down and visited me in Austin, stayed
[01:39:54.600 --> 01:39:59.360]  at my house last night, we were talking to the car. 1996 is when I first talked to Ted
[01:39:59.360 --> 01:40:05.360]  Anderson, 17 years ago, ladies and gentlemen, coming up on 18.
[01:40:05.360 --> 01:40:13.320]  And go look Better Business Bureau, Better Business Bureau A plus rating. You can't even
[01:40:13.320 --> 01:40:17.880]  find that that I know of anywhere. I mean, sure, I'm selling gold, it went from $260
[01:40:17.880 --> 01:40:23.560]  an ounce to a 2,000, gone back down to 1,600 and something. Man, that's a win, win, win.
[01:40:23.560 --> 01:40:31.440]  Well, the stock market's at 14,500. It's with devalued dollars, that's inflation, folks.
[01:40:31.440 --> 01:40:37.160]  It might hit 100,000. The hyperinflation accelerates, it might hit 300,000. Hell, the Dow might
[01:40:37.160 --> 01:40:40.880]  hit a billion if it goes Zimbabwe or Weimar Republic.
[01:40:40.880 --> 01:40:44.920]  I mean, look at Ted Anderson, sponsor right here with us, but I've got him to talk about
[01:40:44.920 --> 01:40:48.640]  issues. And he's also doing some interviews on the nightly news with us. So come down
[01:40:48.640 --> 01:40:54.600]  and visit, we haven't seen him about six months in person. And Ted Anderson came up with a
[01:40:54.600 --> 01:40:59.160]  deal with a free Obama deception, a free American dream, great animated cartoon that even kids
[01:40:59.160 --> 01:41:02.280]  could watch, a little racy, maybe 12 and up.
[01:41:02.280 --> 01:41:07.040]  It looks like something can be on Adult Swim, it's so good, or even better than that. I
[01:41:07.040 --> 01:41:11.520]  mean, it's theatrical quality film on the Federal Reserve and the Rothschilds and the
[01:41:11.520 --> 01:41:16.840]  dollars. I mean, it'll wake anybody up. That's free, that's 20 bucks. Obama deception, 20
[01:41:16.840 --> 01:41:21.640]  bucks. And two silver dollars from the turn of the last century that have numismatic value,
[01:41:21.640 --> 01:41:26.120]  but he sells them at cost with free shipping, so it's below cost.
[01:41:26.120 --> 01:41:31.440]  That shipping's about $10, two silver dollars, two films, a book, free shipping, two silver
[01:41:31.440 --> 01:41:40.160]  dollars, $72. That's over $140 value, conservatively, $72 at MidasResources.com, a link up at Infowars.com.
[01:41:40.160 --> 01:41:42.580]  Right at the top of the page, you can see it there on the right-hand side. I'm not even
[01:41:42.580 --> 01:41:48.280]  getting him here to plug. My point is just explaining to that last guy how I work. I
[01:41:48.280 --> 01:41:52.240]  go out and find the best deals I can get. That's a loss leader, so you get the stuff,
[01:41:52.240 --> 01:41:54.720]  make a relationship, and then buy more gold and silver from Ted.
[01:41:54.720 --> 01:41:59.000]  And by the way, Ted's so competitive that even though he's the fifth largest gold and
[01:41:59.000 --> 01:42:04.040]  silver dealer in the country, he really, last few years, has made almost no profit. He owns
[01:42:04.040 --> 01:42:08.280]  Genesis Network, it's done very, very well, over 1,000 plus affiliates right now. We should
[01:42:08.280 --> 01:42:13.600]  probably talk about that some with Ted. In fact, it's way more than that. Explosive growth,
[01:42:13.600 --> 01:42:17.800]  getting new stations every week just on this show, but all his other shows exploding.
[01:42:17.800 --> 01:42:21.040]  And I've known Ted from the beginning before he even had a radio network when he was just
[01:42:21.040 --> 01:42:26.200]  my gold sponsor, cuz I shopped around and found a place that had bullion right at close
[01:42:26.200 --> 01:42:31.000]  to melt and real numismatic at fair prices. A lot of numismatic companies have triple
[01:42:31.000 --> 01:42:38.120]  markup. A coin should be 600 bucks, it's 1,800. Not with Ted Anderson. He's got the best brokers,
[01:42:38.120 --> 01:42:42.640]  the best people. Ted, I didn't get you here over this. I wanted to get you here to have
[01:42:42.640 --> 01:42:45.480]  some other meetings with us and work on some young jeopardy stuff we're doing with him
[01:42:45.480 --> 01:42:49.440]  for his health, and for the nightly news.
[01:42:49.440 --> 01:42:53.520]  But here you are, I've gone into this whole rant. Do you think it's fear mongering, Ted,
[01:42:53.520 --> 01:42:58.680]  to say they're gonna devalue the dollar, gold 260 bucks get into it, and ten years later
[01:42:58.680 --> 01:43:03.320]  it's 1,600. Is that fear mongering to say there's drones, there's bullets, and then
[01:43:03.320 --> 01:43:07.400]  they said I was a liar, but now it's all admitted. Is it fear mongering to be right? I mean,
[01:43:07.400 --> 01:43:11.760]  is it fear mongering for your doctor to say you better quit drinking a half bottle of
[01:43:11.760 --> 01:43:13.680]  vodka, your liver's gonna fail.
[01:43:13.680 --> 01:43:18.160]  Well, obviously not, Alex, and some people just wanna pick on you. And for whatever reason,
[01:43:18.160 --> 01:43:22.520]  I mean, it's like, hey, the guy is just soaring through the clouds. I mean, your show is just
[01:43:22.520 --> 01:43:27.600]  doing fantastic, and you have people that draw these images of fear mongering. I mean,
[01:43:27.600 --> 01:43:33.960]  come on, the Federal Reserve System is creating $85 billion every month and lending it to
[01:43:33.960 --> 01:43:39.280]  themselves and we end up having to pay the taxes to service interest on debt.
[01:43:39.280 --> 01:43:43.400]  I mean, come on, we're not talking about fear mongering here. We're just talking about some
[01:43:43.400 --> 01:43:49.920]  of the obvious facts that we have to take advantage of and work with. The thing about-
[01:43:49.920 --> 01:43:54.680]  No, apologize for saying get gold at 216, it's 16 plus 100. Apologize for saying get
[01:43:54.680 --> 01:44:00.640]  silver at $4 and it's 30 something. Apologize. Apologize for being right.
[01:44:00.640 --> 01:44:02.480]  Okay, I apologize for being right.
[01:44:02.480 --> 01:44:05.240]  I apologize for breaking thousands of major stories.
[01:44:05.240 --> 01:44:06.840]  Yeah, I just need to tell you-
[01:44:06.840 --> 01:44:07.840]  That are confirmed.
[01:44:07.840 --> 01:44:14.080]  I mean, people would be foolish to think that you can create paper and not increase productivity
[01:44:14.080 --> 01:44:17.040]  and have the same value there. It's just not gonna happen.
[01:44:17.040 --> 01:44:20.920]  I helped Ted write a radio ad we're gonna run or a TV ad. Can you guys go get the script
[01:44:20.920 --> 01:44:23.960]  of that? I wrote with Ted at like 9 AM this morning. I wanna read that on air cuz that's
[01:44:23.960 --> 01:44:25.520]  what we really think.
[01:44:25.520 --> 01:44:29.320]  Well then, Henson's got it back. Will you guys run somebody to get that back in the
[01:44:29.320 --> 01:44:33.280]  shipping department? I wanna read that on air. Go ahead, Ted. Go ahead, extremist.
[01:44:33.280 --> 01:44:38.200]  That's what I'm saying. I mean, if you're gonna create paper, and obviously paper is
[01:44:38.200 --> 01:44:42.480]  just developed from gold in the first place. People deposited their gold at suppositories
[01:44:42.480 --> 01:44:46.640]  and got certificates that were exchangeable back for the gold again. That's how paper
[01:44:46.640 --> 01:44:48.320]  money came into existence.
[01:44:48.320 --> 01:44:51.800]  And now all of a sudden they think, hey, we're just gonna remove the gold from the thing
[01:44:51.800 --> 01:44:56.600]  and we're just gonna print as much paper as we want to, as much as we feel that is necessary
[01:44:56.600 --> 01:44:57.720]  in order to get the economy going.
[01:44:57.720 --> 01:44:59.000]  They put the gold in the suppository?
[01:44:59.000 --> 01:45:01.880]  Yeah, exactly. Well, yeah, the depository, yeah.
[01:45:01.880 --> 01:45:05.640]  No, I've done that too myself. Like, that's where you're hiding the gold? That's where
[01:45:05.640 --> 01:45:11.200]  they hid the gold watch in Pulp Fiction. I'm sorry.
[01:45:11.200 --> 01:45:14.600]  So there you go. So you have a certificate that says it's redeemable in gold. And even
[01:45:14.600 --> 01:45:19.320]  the United States adopted this concept when it was originally formed. It's in the Constitution.
[01:45:19.320 --> 01:45:24.540]  Look, just type in heavy weights by gold, Russian government, UT. Soros doubles down
[01:45:24.540 --> 01:45:30.200]  every month, buys masses of gold while badmouthing it and using paper naked shorts. Well, people
[01:45:30.200 --> 01:45:31.800]  like him to drive it down.
[01:45:31.800 --> 01:45:34.960]  Talk about naked shorting what's been happening. I see all this as a buying opportunity.
[01:45:34.960 --> 01:45:38.600]  Well, I mean, the thing about it is, Alex, to suppress the price of gold, I mean, a few
[01:45:38.600 --> 01:45:42.000]  ways you can go about doing that. You can go into the futures market. You can sell your
[01:45:42.000 --> 01:45:45.960]  gold short. You don't have the gold. You're suppressing the price. They're trading in
[01:45:45.960 --> 01:45:47.920]  the EFT markets.
[01:45:47.920 --> 01:45:50.800]  Germans ask for their gold, told sorry, you gotta get it in 10-year increments?
[01:45:50.800 --> 01:45:51.800]  Yeah, I mean-
[01:45:51.800 --> 01:45:52.800]  Cuz the Easter Bunny has it?
[01:45:52.800 --> 01:45:56.440]  Right, exactly. I mean, the whole thing is a papered over mess.
[01:45:56.440 --> 01:46:02.440]  No, no, no. Libor admits all that. It's now admitted that the private central banks collude
[01:46:02.440 --> 01:46:06.200]  to implode economies and fix interest rates, giving themselves free credit and raking us
[01:46:06.200 --> 01:46:09.960]  over the coals. All confirmed, we're right, world government announced, but Southern Poverty
[01:46:09.960 --> 01:46:11.920]  Law Center says it doesn't exist and we're racist.
[01:46:11.920 --> 01:46:13.520]  See, we don't even know what the value of-
[01:46:13.520 --> 01:46:17.680]  Racist, racist, racist. I don't wanna hear your facts, racist.
[01:46:17.680 --> 01:46:18.680]  Yeah, we don't even know what the value of-
[01:46:18.680 --> 01:46:24.120]  White, racist, white, racist, white, racist, white, racist. Shut up, racist, shut up, racist.
[01:46:24.120 --> 01:46:28.840]  I've actually gone and protested abortion clinics back when I did that like in 17 years
[01:46:28.840 --> 01:46:32.480]  ago, 16 years ago. And now I talk about it on air, but I've been out there many times.
[01:46:32.480 --> 01:46:35.040]  And they would actually have the socialists come over and go, cuz a lot of times it was
[01:46:35.040 --> 01:46:36.040]  quote minorities.
[01:46:36.040 --> 01:46:41.480]  They'd go, shut up, racist, go home, racist. And back then I was like, I'm not a racist,
[01:46:41.480 --> 01:46:45.420]  but the fact is it's a psych warfare thing. They're in there cutting up black babies,
[01:46:45.420 --> 01:46:49.960]  and they need to get that white supremacist operation run, and they're not gonna allow
[01:46:49.960 --> 01:46:50.960]  me to stop it.
[01:46:50.960 --> 01:46:53.040]  I know, I know, and that's the thing. I mean, the black babies-
[01:46:53.040 --> 01:46:57.120]  Racist, racist, racist, racist. I guess it's not racist.
[01:46:57.120 --> 01:47:04.560]  Racist, racist, racist. Racist, racist, racist. Yeah, but just as I was trying to say, I
[01:47:04.560 --> 01:47:08.240]  mean, we no longer know the value of money. If you go deposit-
[01:47:08.240 --> 01:47:17.880]  Racist, racist, racist. Don't worry about the bullets, the drones, the imploding economy,
[01:47:17.880 --> 01:47:22.440]  the cancer viruses, the diabetes exploding, the people dying, the mass abortions, the
[01:47:22.440 --> 01:47:26.320]  war, the death, the government running Al-Qaeda. Racist people.
[01:47:26.320 --> 01:47:31.480]  You sound like you have some passion with that, Alex, and I can tell-
[01:47:31.480 --> 01:47:37.320]  I'm sorry. You have done well, Lord Vader.
[01:47:37.320 --> 01:47:42.120]  We have gotten to the point- And now, young Jedi, you will die. I'm sorry.
[01:47:42.120 --> 01:47:46.360]  Yeah, no, that's right. Anyways, I mean, think about it. If we're gonna deposit our money
[01:47:46.360 --> 01:47:49.840]  in the bank, and we're gonna get a half a percent return, and the Federal Reserve System
[01:47:49.840 --> 01:47:54.340]  is gonna make $85 billion a month to try to keep the interest rates suppressed and low,
[01:47:54.340 --> 01:47:55.340]  isn't that manipulation?
[01:47:55.340 --> 01:48:00.000]  No, it's not happening. Nothing's happening. There is no Federal Reserve. There are no
[01:48:00.000 --> 01:48:01.720]  bullets. These aren't the droids you're looking for.
[01:48:01.720 --> 01:48:05.320]  Yeah, I mean, just even- You're not even here, Ted. Ted, you just fell
[01:48:05.320 --> 01:48:11.160]  down and hit your head. Wake up, Ted. That's gaslighting. The public is so suggestive now.
[01:48:11.160 --> 01:48:14.080]  You can tell the average public that, and they think they've fallen down.
[01:48:14.080 --> 01:48:18.240]  No, that's the thing. I mean- Oh, racist.
[01:48:18.240 --> 01:48:20.880]  People are blind to what's really going on. And anyways-
[01:48:20.880 --> 01:48:24.520]  They're blind to your racism. The racism card is always being pulled, but
[01:48:24.520 --> 01:48:30.640]  I can tell you right now, it makes absolutely no sense to stay in paper-
[01:48:30.640 --> 01:48:33.640]  Racist. And to watch the Dow Jones Industrial Average
[01:48:33.640 --> 01:48:35.400]  go up just like you're saying. Racist.
[01:48:35.400 --> 01:48:38.840]  It's happening because they're manipulating the interest rates and keeping them down.
[01:48:38.840 --> 01:48:40.880]  Racist. We're just gonna continue to print money,
[01:48:40.880 --> 01:48:43.360]  that Dow Jones is gonna go up forever? Money is not what?
[01:48:43.360 --> 01:48:47.080]  I'm not listening to you. That's racist. Well, anyways, so I'm just telling you at
[01:48:47.080 --> 01:48:51.920]  this point in time, we are sitting here on the edge of a collapse, and they're trying
[01:48:51.920 --> 01:48:54.560]  to solve the collapsing problem by printing paper.
[01:48:54.560 --> 01:48:58.920]  Let me read from the New York Times and the LA Times here. It says, wanting to keep your
[01:48:58.920 --> 01:49:03.640]  guns and believing in this is, what can be done to reverse the tide of belligerent ignorance
[01:49:03.640 --> 01:49:08.760]  of white men? And it doesn't say who wrote it. So why are you belligerent and not admitting
[01:49:08.760 --> 01:49:12.840]  you're a racist? It's funny, that's stuff that they come up
[01:49:12.840 --> 01:49:17.160]  with, isn't it? I mean, Jesus, you look at that and you go, man, how could this be printed?
[01:49:17.160 --> 01:49:20.640]  I mean, what's the point? I mean, what is it? Black men get to have guns, white men
[01:49:20.640 --> 01:49:23.680]  don't? Racist.
[01:49:23.680 --> 01:49:28.060]  It's absolutely crazy. And then you're talking about the abortions, and most the abortions
[01:49:28.060 --> 01:49:30.680]  are black kids. And if you're against it, it's racist.
[01:49:30.680 --> 01:49:33.480]  And it's not killing people. Racist.
[01:49:33.480 --> 01:49:39.680]  I mean, the whole thing, I mean, everything is just twisted and turned upside down. And
[01:49:39.680 --> 01:49:44.040]  the monetary system is just as much into it as any-
[01:49:44.040 --> 01:49:47.760]  By the way, who wrote that headline? Cuz they got it even better than the headline I came
[01:49:47.760 --> 01:49:52.200]  up for with Nemo. Put that back on screen. White men, see, that's what I'm talking about
[01:49:52.200 --> 01:49:53.200]  with my writers.
[01:49:53.200 --> 01:49:56.720]  The reality of that article is worse than the LA Times saying white men are the new
[01:49:56.720 --> 01:50:00.040]  terrorists. I couldn't come up with it. And I said it's worse than that. The guy accused
[01:50:00.040 --> 01:50:05.320]  me of fear mongering. It's where LA Times says conservative white men worse than terrorists
[01:50:05.320 --> 01:50:06.640]  need monitoring.
[01:50:06.640 --> 01:50:15.220]  That is exactly what they really said. Who's that from, The Examiner? Who's that writer?
[01:50:15.220 --> 01:50:21.720]  Joe Newby needs to be my headline writer. See, it's racist.
[01:50:21.720 --> 01:50:28.320]  Anyways, Alex, like you say, I mean, everything is twisted, it's turned, it's backwards, it's
[01:50:28.320 --> 01:50:33.640]  inside out. And how can anybody make sense of it? If you just follow what's being told
[01:50:33.640 --> 01:50:38.720]  to us by the mainstream media and our federal government and the government above the federal
[01:50:38.720 --> 01:50:42.480]  government called the Federal Reserve System, they're gonna tell you what we need to do
[01:50:42.480 --> 01:50:44.640]  is print money to get the economy moving.
[01:50:44.640 --> 01:50:48.580]  I got news for you. Printing money is not creating wealth. Creating wealth is getting
[01:50:48.580 --> 01:50:50.560]  out there and working and creating something.
[01:50:50.560 --> 01:50:54.360]  That's what I expect a racist to say. All right, we'll be back for more of the racist
[01:50:54.360 --> 01:51:01.240]  hour here. 800-686-2237. If you want to call Midas Resources and talk to the evil people
[01:51:01.240 --> 01:51:02.240]  there.

[01:53:02.720 --> 01:53:07.280]  Answer this. What effective home security device is smaller than a coffee cup fakes
[01:53:07.280 --> 01:53:11.440]  out burglars into thinking someone is home at your house while you're away, plugs into
[01:53:11.440 --> 01:53:18.020]  any wall outlet, is recommended by many police departments and sells for less than $35? Yes,
[01:53:18.020 --> 01:53:23.480]  it's fake TV. This year about one in every 50 US homes will have a break in with burglars
[01:53:23.480 --> 01:53:29.040]  usually picking the easy target, a dark house that looks like no one is home. Fake TV is
[01:53:29.040 --> 01:53:33.940]  a small electronic security device that makes it look like someone is home watching TV by
[01:53:33.940 --> 01:53:39.400]  simulating the light from a real TV. It's like a lamp on a timer but far more convincing.
[01:53:39.400 --> 01:53:44.120]  And for only $34.95, fake TV could be the difference between coming home to a secure
[01:53:44.120 --> 01:53:55.320]  house or one that's been ransacked. Go to faketv.com or call 1-877-5FAKETV. That's 877-532-5388
[01:53:55.320 --> 01:54:10.920]  or go to faketv.com. Fake TV, the burglar deterrent.
[01:54:10.920 --> 01:54:14.920]  We are back live, ladies and gentlemen, Chad Anderson's our guest. We have a special guest
[01:54:14.920 --> 01:54:18.880]  surprise guest in studio after that. I know I said I'd go to your phone calls if everybody
[01:54:18.880 --> 01:54:22.640]  wants to hang up, they can or you can stay on hold. I'll try to get to you. I get a little
[01:54:22.640 --> 01:54:27.600]  bit wound up here on air during the fair mongering and divide and conquer operations. Getting
[01:54:27.600 --> 01:54:32.840]  serious though, actually not getting serious, David Ortiz back there just made the joke
[01:54:32.840 --> 01:54:41.240]  one of our reporters that, well, obviously, the white smoke coming out of the Vatican,
[01:54:41.240 --> 01:54:46.000]  that's a sign of racism and the Pope was white.
[01:54:46.000 --> 01:54:50.840]  Everything's racist except what's really racist or global is shutting everything down. Now,
[01:54:50.840 --> 01:54:59.200]  here's an ad we wrote for a TV ad script that we're putting together for Ted while he's
[01:54:59.200 --> 01:55:02.680]  down here in town, but I think this says it all. Ted and I agreed, collaborated on this
[01:55:02.680 --> 01:55:06.720]  this morning and wrote this. Hi, I'm Ted Anderson, but I'm actually Alex Jones. Ted's right there.
[01:55:06.720 --> 01:55:10.760]  In fact, while I'm reading this, we'll aim the camera at Ted. Hi, I'm Ted Anderson, president
[01:55:10.760 --> 01:55:15.120]  of Minus Resources. With more than 30 years of experience in precious metals industry,
[01:55:15.120 --> 01:55:20.420]  I can unequivocally tell you that this is the most volatility, volatile and dangerous
[01:55:20.420 --> 01:55:23.060]  time for our economy that we have ever seen.
[01:55:23.060 --> 01:55:26.960]  Not just in the United States but worldwide. We are now only entering the edge of a global
[01:55:26.960 --> 01:55:31.080]  financial superstorm, the likes of which the planet has never seen. Here in the United
[01:55:31.080 --> 01:55:35.920]  States, the private Federal Reserve is giving more than $85 billion of taxpayer money a
[01:55:35.920 --> 01:55:41.080]  month to themselves and other foreign offshore banks. And the worst part is taxpayers are
[01:55:41.080 --> 01:55:44.560]  being forced to pay interest through high taxes on the money we give them.
[01:55:44.560 --> 01:55:51.040]  Did you hear that? That's the really rich part, the fun part. It goes on continuing,
[01:55:51.040 --> 01:55:55.580]  there is now a race worldwide, that's code for racism. There is now a race worldwide
[01:55:55.580 --> 01:56:01.880]  between central banks to see who can devalue their currencies the fastest. We are already
[01:56:01.880 --> 01:56:07.080]  seeing big increases in inflation in every case in history, this road leads to hyperinflation.
[01:56:07.080 --> 01:56:10.800]  More than a dozen top globalists like George Soros, we're gonna put all those articles
[01:56:10.800 --> 01:56:15.340]  in, have been buying record amounts of gold while at the same time bad mouthing it into
[01:56:15.340 --> 01:56:16.440]  the public.
[01:56:16.440 --> 01:56:21.400]  Don't just listen to what they say, watch what they do. For more than 6,000 years, gold
[01:56:21.400 --> 01:56:26.000]  has been the ultimate hedge against uncertain times and inflation. While it's important
[01:56:26.000 --> 01:56:30.160]  to be diversified, I personally, that's Ted Anderson riding with me and others, they're
[01:56:30.160 --> 01:56:35.160]  typing, I have more than 50% of my savings and investments in precious metals.
[01:56:35.160 --> 01:56:40.280]  Before getting into metals, it's important to do your research and find a reputable company,
[01:56:40.280 --> 01:56:47.560]  Midas Resources has the greatest and highest Better Business Bureau rating of A plus. Unfortunately,
[01:56:47.560 --> 01:56:53.280]  very few precious metal companies can boast that, yeah, that is unfortunate. Midas Resources,
[01:56:53.280 --> 01:56:57.240]  we couldn't actually find any, but we assume they're there, so we just said most.
[01:56:57.240 --> 01:57:02.500]  So there I am like cutting it back, I don't really exaggerate, I usually cut back. Midas
[01:57:02.500 --> 01:57:07.120]  Resources has assembled one of the most educated research professional group of brokers in
[01:57:07.120 --> 01:57:13.320]  the industry. Now is the time to investigate gold and silver, call 800-686-2237, and we

[01:57:23.160 --> 01:57:27.560]  free, Midas Resources has one of the biggest selections of precious metals in North America
[01:57:27.560 --> 01:57:30.240]  on hand and ready to ship, a lot of people don't.

[01:57:53.720 --> 01:57:54.720]  they are.

[01:59:54.480 --> 02:00:06.000]  Joining war on corruption, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:06.000 --> 02:00:13.000]  Big brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does
[02:00:13.000 --> 02:00:21.800]  he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:21.800 --> 02:00:31.960]  All right, final segment with Ted Anderson and we've got our next guest coming in, but
[02:00:31.960 --> 02:00:39.920]  I will jam in before we get to the guest. Jared and Jimmy and Jason Williams-Skye because
[02:00:39.920 --> 02:00:44.280]  I appreciate you holding. And we're going to really get into vaccines with a special
[02:00:44.280 --> 02:00:48.320]  guest who's your grandfather. We had a lot of scientists, doctors, brain surgeons on
[02:00:48.320 --> 02:00:51.800]  exposing deadly vaccines, but this is a guy who's just really articulate. I really enjoy
[02:00:51.800 --> 02:00:58.320]  listening to him on the radio locally here on 90.1 and I'll get him on the Sunday show.
[02:00:58.320 --> 02:01:03.120]  We also have that 4 to 6 PM, that's on 590 AM here in town. Ted, I've been ranting, I
[02:01:03.120 --> 02:01:06.920]  kind of got in a little bit of a fun mood, manic mood, they call it that, but that's
[02:01:06.920 --> 02:01:10.120]  not what it is, kind of a brainstorm mood. Seriously, what else do you want to add about
[02:01:10.120 --> 02:01:12.840]  what's happening in the world?
[02:01:12.840 --> 02:01:16.680]  The spot that you're reading covers it quite a bit, but I mean, the thing about it is we're
[02:01:16.680 --> 02:01:22.680]  watching the money being printed by the Federal Reserve System, stimulating the economy, pushing
[02:01:22.680 --> 02:01:28.920]  the stock market up without adding true value to the economy. You know that the value of
[02:01:28.920 --> 02:01:33.680]  the currency is going to suffer from it. And the problem with the whole thing is it's all
[02:01:33.680 --> 02:01:35.680]  smoke and mirrors.
[02:01:35.680 --> 02:01:42.320]  They're destroying the very essence of what, it's like white is becoming black and black
[02:01:42.320 --> 02:01:47.440]  is becoming white. What is supposed to go up is now going down, what is supposed to
[02:01:47.440 --> 02:01:52.640]  go down is now going up. It confuses the market. And having all that going on, I mean, how
[02:01:52.640 --> 02:01:55.440]  are you going to ever make a good decision financially?
[02:01:55.440 --> 02:01:58.420]  And one of the things that you can do is you know darn well that if you put your money
[02:01:58.420 --> 02:02:02.480]  into gold and silver, you're going to be able to count on the fact that that gold and silver
[02:02:02.480 --> 02:02:07.080]  will be able to buy something 10 years from now, 20 years from now. All this manipulation
[02:02:07.080 --> 02:02:16.180]  and trickery and smoke and mirrors is just causing people to have a fog to make decisions
[02:02:16.180 --> 02:02:18.520]  that are not really the correct decisions.
[02:02:18.520 --> 02:02:22.180]  Why would you get into the stock market if the Federal Reserve System is printing money
[02:02:22.180 --> 02:02:23.360]  and forcing the market down?
[02:02:23.360 --> 02:02:27.040]  But what about the cynicalness of hundreds of newspapers saying there's no world government,
[02:02:27.040 --> 02:02:30.640]  there's not 2 billion bullets, there's no drones. What do you make of that tactic? Cuz
[02:02:30.640 --> 02:02:34.480]  I've never seen such open hoaxing. Is that a sign of desperation?
[02:02:34.480 --> 02:02:39.760]  Well, you know, Alex, I think they're still trying to keep the smoke in the eyes of the
[02:02:39.760 --> 02:02:46.320]  people. I mean, it's easier to defend an argument like that by saying these people are crazy.
[02:02:46.320 --> 02:02:48.680]  They're the conspiracy theorists.
[02:02:48.680 --> 02:02:49.680]  You know-
[02:02:49.680 --> 02:02:51.200]  Yeah, they don't want, I mean, it's an enemy attack. They don't want us to know they're
[02:02:51.200 --> 02:02:52.200]  gearing up.
[02:02:52.200 --> 02:02:56.760]  However, you can see the G20 meeting, the G7 meeting. These bankers get together and
[02:02:56.760 --> 02:03:00.660]  they decide what they're gonna do economically and also whether we're gonna fight wars across
[02:03:00.660 --> 02:03:06.440]  the United States, across the world. All these different plans happen, it's real, it does
[02:03:06.440 --> 02:03:07.440]  happen.
[02:03:07.440 --> 02:03:11.520]  And even our politicians admit that it happens. But yet, if you bring it up, they try to paint
[02:03:11.520 --> 02:03:16.460]  you as some sort of a conspiracy person. The fact of the matter is they're manipulating,
[02:03:16.460 --> 02:03:17.460]  they're trying to keep the people-
[02:03:17.460 --> 02:03:21.120]  And that's all admitted. But I mean, I don't see people buying into it anymore. That's
[02:03:21.120 --> 02:03:24.200]  why they're now trying to inject all this race stuff just to confuse everything.
[02:03:24.200 --> 02:03:30.960]  Right, it's like a whole other argument. It's a way to add water to the milk and to-
[02:03:30.960 --> 02:03:36.040]  I bet it would work with a politically correct person who's not actually an engineer, a manipulator,
[02:03:36.040 --> 02:03:39.720]  but actually buys into it a bleeding heart. If the guy walked in and found his wife with
[02:03:39.720 --> 02:03:42.920]  another, let's say it's a white guy with a white woman, and the white guy walks in and
[02:03:42.920 --> 02:03:43.920]  catches his wife.
[02:03:43.920 --> 02:03:48.500]  If the guy with the wife just jumped up and said racist, then the other white guy would
[02:03:48.500 --> 02:03:52.640]  probably bow down and ask him to blow his head off or something. I mean, he wouldn't
[02:03:52.640 --> 02:03:57.360]  even get upset. He would say, here, take my blood. I mean, kill me, take my house, take
[02:03:57.360 --> 02:04:01.600]  my wife. I mean, it literally just works on people, though that's why they're doing it.
[02:04:01.600 --> 02:04:03.960]  We laugh at it because we're awake, but it's not funny.
[02:04:03.960 --> 02:04:07.720]  No, it really isn't funny, Alex. And it's obvious that it's happening and everybody
[02:04:07.720 --> 02:04:14.160]  knows it. But yet, still, if you talk about this on air in the media like you do, you're
[02:04:14.160 --> 02:04:15.720]  gonna get a whole bunch of pushback.
[02:04:15.720 --> 02:04:21.080]  Well, I mean, take Obama deception, all the stuff he's done. He said, I will not raise
[02:04:21.080 --> 02:04:24.260]  your payroll tax unless you make a quarter million dollars a year. He raised it on people
[02:04:24.260 --> 02:04:28.920]  making less than 30,000. I was correct, it's like 22,000 a year. I kept saying 30 cuz I
[02:04:28.920 --> 02:04:29.920]  saw that in a news article.
[02:04:29.920 --> 02:04:35.400]  22,000 a year, you got a payroll increase. And then they said, you're racist if you don't
[02:04:35.400 --> 02:04:41.620]  support Obamacare. And what does that have to do with race? Why are these people able
[02:04:41.620 --> 02:04:43.360]  to run things? They're a bunch of crooks.
[02:04:43.360 --> 02:04:50.460]  I know, and it's all about deception. And again, Alex, if they can't make a good argument,
[02:04:50.460 --> 02:04:52.800]  they just try to paint it with a different color.
[02:04:52.800 --> 02:04:57.520]  Well, Ted, all I can say is I wanna know where the gold at. And I know it's at minus resources,
[02:04:57.520 --> 02:05:03.320]  great prices, that's where people should shop, minus resources.
[02:05:03.320 --> 02:05:09.600]  If you want an American company with American products made by Americans, here is the Cal

[02:07:01.440 --> 02:07:05.840]  I had tried everything. I'd cut back the amount of food I was eating. I was lifting weights
[02:07:05.840 --> 02:07:10.960]  and jogging, but nothing was working. My body was literally starving for minerals and trace
[02:07:10.960 --> 02:07:16.460]  elements as well as key vitamins, and as soon as I had that, I immediately could eat half
[02:07:16.460 --> 02:07:21.560]  of what I was eating previously and be satisfied. Now, there are hundreds of great products
[02:07:21.560 --> 02:07:28.680]  at infowarsteam.com, but I want to point out the three that have helped me lose 37 pounds

[02:07:40.640 --> 02:07:47.640]  in just two months. Now that's results. I want to challenge my listeners to go to infowarsteam.com
[02:07:47.640 --> 02:07:52.120]  and to order just three of their products, and you will see the changes in the way you

[02:08:05.000 --> 02:08:14.200]  We are on the march. The empire is on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:14.200 --> 02:08:20.200]  Folks, as you know, Michael Moore is saying he's going to finish off the Second Amendment
[02:08:20.200 --> 02:08:27.740]  and the NRA by trying to get the photos released, and Dianne Feinstein's been licking her lips
[02:08:27.740 --> 02:08:31.640]  about that. Watch a hacker get them or something, and they're just going to throw them up there
[02:08:31.640 --> 02:08:34.280]  and show them it'll all be photoshopped.
[02:08:34.280 --> 02:08:38.240]  This is looking more and more like a staged deal. I mean, they've staged other mass killings
[02:08:38.240 --> 02:08:43.280]  the globalist have, and it has all the telltale signs. Aurora, no doubt was, and we know they
[02:08:43.280 --> 02:08:47.780]  staged Fast and Furious, and now it's admitted our government runs Al-Qaeda and Taliban not
[02:08:47.780 --> 02:08:53.300]  just in Libya and Syria, which they admit, but also in Afghanistan. That's all coming
[02:08:53.300 --> 02:08:58.920]  out now. And our average military and police are good people. They're compartmentalized.
[02:08:58.920 --> 02:08:59.920]  So are we.
[02:08:59.920 --> 02:09:04.520]  We've got to break out of the compartmentalization, come together under liberty, the Bill of Rights,
[02:09:04.520 --> 02:09:10.880]  the Constitution. So America, you must not look away how to finish off the NRA. This
[02:09:10.880 --> 02:09:14.240]  is a guy who's had his bodyguards arrested in areas that's illegal to have guns like
[02:09:14.240 --> 02:09:19.640]  airports. This is a guy who owns guns himself. This is a pig. This is a pig-like authoritarian
[02:09:19.640 --> 02:09:25.560]  scumbag. Okay, basically a fascist posing as a socialist communist who wants your wealth
[02:09:25.560 --> 02:09:28.600]  and works for the big banks that conduit our wealth overseas.
[02:09:28.600 --> 02:09:32.240]  And we're talking to Sean Siegel and Marcy Terry in just a moment. He's in studio. She's
[02:09:32.240 --> 02:09:36.280]  via video Skype. I promise to get to your calls. I appreciate you holding one minute
[02:09:36.280 --> 02:09:40.080]  apiece and we'll get to our guest on some of the most important information out there.
[02:09:40.080 --> 02:09:44.880]  I don't care what color you are. The vaccines are killing people in mass. They know what
[02:09:44.880 --> 02:09:48.840]  they're doing. I've had a lot of scientists and doctors on and Mr. Siegel and his guests
[02:09:48.840 --> 02:09:52.480]  are some of the most articulate on the facts I already knew. And I say that to say I'm
[02:09:52.480 --> 02:09:53.480]  smart.
[02:09:53.480 --> 02:09:56.960]  I know they know what they're talking about. And so you need to listen to them about how
[02:09:56.960 --> 02:10:02.480]  crazy this whole vaccine situation is. I mean, there's hundreds and hundreds of studies,
[02:10:02.480 --> 02:10:05.960]  20 new ones by Harvard over 20 years. They just study every year and looks at all these
[02:10:05.960 --> 02:10:11.800]  other studies and said cancer, brain damage, all of it. I mean, we already knew that. Why
[02:10:11.800 --> 02:10:12.800]  is it in my water?
[02:10:12.800 --> 02:10:18.400]  It's one thing if it's topical occasionally. It does strengthen teeth topically. You don't
[02:10:18.400 --> 02:10:25.280]  drink sunscreen to have sun protection. But we're going to look at and that's the sodium
[02:10:25.280 --> 02:10:29.560]  fluoride, not the hydrofluorosolic acid or calcium for. But I'm already digressing real
[02:10:29.560 --> 02:10:35.240]  fast. Jared, Ohio. Thanks for holding. You're on the air. Welcome, Alex. Thanks. With all
[02:10:35.240 --> 02:10:40.320]  due respect, your last caller. I've been following you since 2006. I've researched some of the
[02:10:40.320 --> 02:10:44.560]  stories when I first started looking at your stuff. It's solid. It is. It is actually worse
[02:10:44.560 --> 02:10:51.040]  than than you guys make it out to be. So just big props on all the work you do. Well, thank
[02:10:51.040 --> 02:10:57.760]  you, sir. Oh, absolutely. I salute you. In my studies, my I think you're on fire today.
[02:10:57.760 --> 02:11:02.500]  In my studies, what I've been focused on is the role of narrative. I think it's so interesting
[02:11:02.500 --> 02:11:08.800]  how the role of narrative and how it it makes our reality. It makes sense of our world and
[02:11:08.800 --> 02:11:14.640]  actually how it shapes identities. I find that fascinating. And in so many ways, you've
[02:11:14.640 --> 02:11:17.920]  been hitting that in your show. I don't know if you could speak to that. I think I think
[02:11:17.920 --> 02:11:23.600]  the whole honestly, if I could characterize the battle today, it's between narratives
[02:11:23.600 --> 02:11:29.640]  of anger based on anger and fear, as opposed to narratives based on peace and liberty and
[02:11:29.640 --> 02:11:35.400]  ultimately love. I hear you. I mean, it's just getting crazier
[02:11:35.400 --> 02:11:42.520]  and crazier. Anything else you'd like to add? No, I just keep up the great work. Thank you.
[02:11:42.520 --> 02:11:48.400]  Thank you so much, Jared. Let's talk to Sky. And we're also getting some headphones for
[02:11:48.400 --> 02:11:52.600]  our guests and show us you can hear the guests over Skype here in a moment. So it's fortuitous.
[02:11:52.600 --> 02:11:57.400]  We're going to calls first. Sky in Alabama. You're on the air. Go ahead.
[02:11:57.400 --> 02:12:01.800]  Hey, Alex, I want to make a couple of points and then I'm going to get to why I called
[02:12:01.800 --> 02:12:06.400]  you. First off, Glenn Beck, I wouldn't worry too much about what he says about you. He's
[02:12:06.400 --> 02:12:10.680]  got four yes men behind him that are paid to laugh at everything he says. I think he's
[02:12:10.680 --> 02:12:15.480]  going down in flames and he's desperate to get libertarians to like him now. My second
[02:12:15.480 --> 02:12:20.480]  thing is, as far as you're always trying to educate and support or educate minorities,
[02:12:20.480 --> 02:12:24.640]  blacks, Hispanics about what's going on. But it seems like so many people in the libertarian
[02:12:24.640 --> 02:12:28.600]  movement or the, you know, the awake, the patriot movement, we leave out the white supremacists.
[02:12:28.600 --> 02:12:32.800]  But I feel sorry for a lot of those people as being ignorant. They don't understand that
[02:12:32.800 --> 02:12:38.000]  FBI runs the Klan. They don't understand that, you know, they're just being manipulated.
[02:12:38.000 --> 02:12:42.200]  And I think, you know, I like sometimes you touch on that and you try to get white supremacists
[02:12:42.200 --> 02:12:46.000]  and those people to understand what's going on. But most of the time people don't even
[02:12:46.000 --> 02:12:49.560]  touch that. And one more last thing is a lot of the reason those people don't like you
[02:12:49.560 --> 02:12:54.440]  is they say you distance yourself from the real truth of the whole Jewish thing. And
[02:12:54.440 --> 02:12:58.720]  I've done research on it because I can't really understand it myself. The best thing I've
[02:12:58.720 --> 02:13:04.800]  found is a YouTube video with David Eich explaining a Rothschild Zionism. But if you look it up,
[02:13:04.800 --> 02:13:08.320]  there's Jewish people that are in charge of all the banks of all the cabinet positions
[02:13:08.320 --> 02:13:09.320]  of everything that matters.
[02:13:09.320 --> 02:13:13.360]  But if you try to bring that up or talk about it, you get screamed out like you just did
[02:13:13.360 --> 02:13:18.200]  the Ted Anderson racist, racist, racist. So that was a, that was a joke with Ted Anderson.
[02:13:18.200 --> 02:13:22.320]  I know, I know I buy from minus resources. I was just playing. But if you ever try to
[02:13:22.320 --> 02:13:26.640]  have that conversation about now, but listen, here's the issue. Okay. And I appreciate your
[02:13:26.640 --> 02:13:30.720]  call. There's all sorts of mafias and ensure there's a Jewish mafia and a lot of stuff
[02:13:30.720 --> 02:13:32.520]  and all these other mafias.
[02:13:32.520 --> 02:13:37.760]  My whole issue is they system is using divide and conquer. How do you describe the eugenics
[02:13:37.760 --> 02:13:43.280]  system that's targeting everybody? And then Hitler was an offshoot of it's an evil system
[02:13:43.280 --> 02:13:48.920]  of social control. Any group can have groups within it that are involved in that. And again,
[02:13:48.920 --> 02:13:53.040]  I get attacked by the black supremacists, the white supremacists, the Hispanic supremacists,
[02:13:53.040 --> 02:13:55.320]  because I'm not in the supremacist game.
[02:13:55.320 --> 02:13:59.600]  And I just, I try to stay out of it and bring people together under basic liberty and a
[02:13:59.600 --> 02:14:06.120]  basic code show that we can have a future. I mean, I remember people saying bad things
[02:14:06.120 --> 02:14:09.840]  about Aaron Russo, made all those films exposing the new world war, the fellow reserve, because
[02:14:09.840 --> 02:14:11.320]  he was Jewish.
[02:14:11.320 --> 02:14:15.180]  And then people saying horrible things about me whenever I have Jewish people on the show
[02:14:15.180 --> 02:14:21.660]  that just Jews are inherently evil. And it's just, it's mindless. And it's an oversimplification
[02:14:21.660 --> 02:14:25.560]  of any such thing. White people are evil because whites once had slaves. Every culture had
[02:14:25.560 --> 02:14:29.120]  slaves, but they were told that to create the division.
[02:14:29.120 --> 02:14:34.440]  So I'm here to try to get Florida out of the water to expose the vaccines are deadly. I'm
[02:14:34.440 --> 02:14:39.200]  here to try to get bistri in LA that's feminizing and giving people cancer out and cause women
[02:14:39.200 --> 02:14:44.800]  to get breast cancer. I mean, and then if I do make a film and expose the USS Liberty
[02:14:44.800 --> 02:14:50.280]  as a false flag run by Israel and LBJ, all the white supremacists go crazy and say that
[02:14:50.280 --> 02:14:54.760]  I'm covering up for Israel because I point out the NORAD, I mean, the Pentagon was in
[02:14:54.760 --> 02:14:56.500]  control because I interviewed the admirals.
[02:14:56.500 --> 02:15:00.560]  They were involved in the stand down too. It was a setup that proves it was a setup
[02:15:00.560 --> 02:15:07.680]  to blame it on Egypt. And it doesn't absolve Israel. It proves the whole thing that I interviewed
[02:15:07.680 --> 02:15:13.280]  more was later Chairman Joint Chiefs and the head of the JAG officers and the admiral who
[02:15:13.280 --> 02:15:18.080]  was on the ship and the first mate and all these people before they died, they're almost
[02:15:18.080 --> 02:15:19.080]  all dead now.
[02:15:19.080 --> 02:15:23.800]  I mean, I probably did 30 shows on it. And for the white supremacist, it was all about
[02:15:23.800 --> 02:15:28.720]  how they're good and I'm bad. So they got really mad at that film. So it's just mental
[02:15:28.720 --> 02:15:34.260]  illness. I mean, it's just and I see the same vicious vitriol out of all the race groups
[02:15:34.260 --> 02:15:38.800]  and the systems using that and controlling it to then try to paint everything that's
[02:15:38.800 --> 02:15:40.040]  good as that.
[02:15:40.040 --> 02:15:44.680]  It's very sophisticated. Let's go to Jason and then we're going to our guests and then
[02:15:44.680 --> 02:15:49.320]  to more calls. And then to Jimmy and others. Jason, you wanna talk about false flag attack?
[02:15:49.320 --> 02:15:54.280]  I see all the preparations for it and they're now gonna blame white gun owners. They say
[02:15:54.280 --> 02:15:56.400]  that's who's gonna stage the terror attack.
[02:15:56.400 --> 02:16:02.040]  We need to have FBI come after all of us, LA Times, New York Times, MSNBC, CNN. We're
[02:16:02.040 --> 02:16:06.040]  gonna blow things up any minute. Gee, we better be looking at who's saying that and knows
[02:16:06.040 --> 02:16:10.560]  the bombings coming. If I was the cops, that's the first group I'd go talk to.
[02:16:10.560 --> 02:16:12.480]  Go ahead, Jason.
[02:16:12.480 --> 02:16:17.720]  Hey, Alex. Thanks for taking my call. Look, I wanna make a couple of points here. You
[02:16:17.720 --> 02:16:23.160]  know how usually Hollywood is always putting out dates in their movies before they actually
[02:16:23.160 --> 02:16:29.320]  have an event or something. And you go back to the money, how they put the trade centers
[02:16:29.320 --> 02:16:31.040]  on that before it actually blew up.
[02:16:31.040 --> 02:16:36.160]  But on the Dark Knight movie, they actually have the date of 322.
[02:16:36.160 --> 02:16:42.480]  Yes, sir. I mean, the media asked, Alex is crazy connecting it to Batman. We said Batman
[02:16:42.480 --> 02:16:47.400]  was a trigger before Aurora and before Sandy Hook and then would have triggers, look for
[02:16:47.400 --> 02:16:48.400]  it.
[02:16:48.400 --> 02:16:53.920]  And then we found Sandy Hook, 322, mind control, maps sent out saying rise with Sandy Hook
[02:16:53.920 --> 02:16:58.920]  listed cuz they like to brag to each other. They call it lesser magic. The globalists
[02:16:58.920 --> 02:17:04.520]  believe that if you model something first small and openly show it, it's like counting
[02:17:04.520 --> 02:17:08.040]  coup of the Native Americans where they conk you on the head three times before they actually
[02:17:08.040 --> 02:17:09.040]  kill you.
[02:17:09.040 --> 02:17:12.920]  It shows I could have killed you three times before I actually killed you. That's when
[02:17:12.920 --> 02:17:18.340]  you get a feather, okay? You don't just get a feather, you gotta kill somebody by counting
[02:17:18.340 --> 02:17:22.480]  coup to get a feather. And everybody's gotta witness it, okay? And you got a whole bunch
[02:17:22.480 --> 02:17:24.480]  of feathers, how many people you killed.
[02:17:24.480 --> 02:17:29.520]  It's counting coup. Sorry, go ahead. Big, deep secret right there.
[02:17:29.520 --> 02:17:33.160]  But yeah, like I said, in the movie The Dark Knight, they actually have that physical date
[02:17:33.160 --> 02:17:39.040]  and that date is actually coming up. But you've got Obama going to Israel. You've got the
[02:17:39.040 --> 02:17:46.000]  Georgia God stones that was erected March 22nd, 1980, which will be exactly 33 years.
[02:17:46.000 --> 02:17:51.260]  You've got the RFID coming out this month. All these things are coming in and I would
[02:17:51.260 --> 02:17:52.260]  say-
[02:17:52.260 --> 02:17:54.560]  This is the anniversary of the Federal Reserve.
[02:17:54.560 --> 02:18:01.440]  You've got the gentleman that put a video out on YouTube and it breaks down the money
[02:18:01.440 --> 02:18:08.360]  system, how they bragged about 9-11. Well, he also has the new $50 bill and it shows
[02:18:08.360 --> 02:18:13.320]  the old 50 with the picture of the Hoover Dam. And you can see on the new 50 and it
[02:18:13.320 --> 02:18:15.520]  looks like the Hoover Dam has actually exploded.
[02:18:15.520 --> 02:18:23.200]  No, I've seen that and I'll pull it up. Let me see, new 50, Hoover Dam, and I'll pull
[02:18:23.200 --> 02:18:30.760]  it up for, I'll pull it up for people.
[02:18:30.760 --> 02:18:36.520]  The Halo game actually has the same video clip, it has the Halo game, it has the Hoover
[02:18:36.520 --> 02:18:38.680]  Dam exploding in that.
[02:18:38.680 --> 02:18:42.280]  Hey, one of the big video games, I forget the name, but we played clips of it on air.
[02:18:42.280 --> 02:18:46.920]  We're gonna go to break, come back with our guests. In one of those games, it's one of
[02:18:46.920 --> 02:18:50.560]  the real famous ones, I can pull it up during the break, came out three months before the
[02:18:50.560 --> 02:18:55.100]  sneak attack by NATO against Russia and South Ossetia and Abkhazia in LA.
[02:18:55.100 --> 02:19:00.000]  They had that exact fight in that very area and those areas in the video game three months
[02:19:00.000 --> 02:19:05.240]  before it happened. And again, it's just all about flaunting it in our face, I hear you.
[02:19:05.240 --> 02:19:07.040]  So what do you think is gonna happen?
[02:19:07.040 --> 02:19:11.360]  I think that if there's gonna be a possible false flag, that would be, they're kind of
[02:19:11.360 --> 02:19:16.360]  bragging about it before time, and we usually see these things after the fact. And it was
[02:19:16.360 --> 02:19:19.720]  right in our face the whole time. I would say that if there's gonna be possibly something
[02:19:19.720 --> 02:19:24.320]  that's gonna happen, I would point to that. But the other thing, too, that's kind of funny
[02:19:24.320 --> 02:19:30.660]  this month with the trip to Israel is you've got Obama that is going on March 22nd. You
[02:19:30.660 --> 02:19:36.440]  have him going into Israel, you know, five days before the Passover, just like Jesus
[02:19:36.440 --> 02:19:44.040]  did. He's, you know, the Democratic Party has the donkey as a symbolism. If you'll count
[02:19:44.040 --> 02:19:49.840]  back, like in the prophecy of Daniel, he talks about the 1260 days. If you'll count back
[02:19:49.840 --> 02:19:58.040]  from March 22nd to 1260 days back, you'll see that Obama received a Nobel Peace Prize
[02:19:58.040 --> 02:19:59.040]  on that day.
[02:19:59.040 --> 02:20:01.400]  And they've also said he's Christ when he was running. We'll be back with our guests.
[02:20:01.400 --> 02:20:07.840]  Hello, I'm Alex Jones. Myself, my family, the Infowars.com team want to relay to you
[02:20:07.840 --> 02:20:12.920]  and your families that we are intensifying our efforts against the globalist on every
[02:20:12.920 --> 02:20:19.880]  front. Infowars.com is leading the fight against the technocrats. But we can't do that without
[02:20:19.880 --> 02:20:25.880]  your help. By getting the films, bumper stickers and T-shirts at Infowars.com, you will wake
[02:20:25.880 --> 02:20:32.640]  up people in your area and support our operation as we move to the next level. We need your
[02:20:32.640 --> 02:20:38.240]  help to spread the word like never before. They wish to hide themselves during this tectonic
[02:20:38.240 --> 02:20:45.520]  battle between the forces of freedom and darkness. You are the response to the globalist technocrats
[02:20:45.520 --> 02:20:53.160]  and their program of global eugenics dehumanization and ultimate extermination. The war is here.
[02:20:53.160 --> 02:21:00.520]  It's an info war. The spirit of 1776 versus the mindset of 1984.
[02:21:00.520 --> 02:21:05.240]  Do you suffer from low functioning adrenal or thyroid gland? Did you know that mercury
[02:21:05.240 --> 02:21:09.480]  from your dental fillings comes off your teeth both as a vapor and as metal particles into
[02:21:09.480 --> 02:21:14.160]  your body? Wherever mercury deposits in your body, it stops cells from functioning normally.
[02:21:14.160 --> 02:21:19.140]  Animal studies show that mercury causes kidney function to drop by 60%. Mercury deposited
[02:21:19.140 --> 02:21:22.880]  into your adrenals or thyroid will cause a corresponding drop in function. The number
[02:21:22.880 --> 02:21:27.080]  one method by which your body detoxifies itself of mercury is glutathione. The number one
[02:21:27.080 --> 02:21:32.480]  superfood that helps turn on all 75 trillion cells in your body to produce glutathione
[02:21:32.480 --> 02:21:38.480]  is non-denatured whey protein from grass-fed cows. After investigating most high-end whey
[02:21:38.480 --> 02:21:43.040]  proteins on the market, only one is the most non-denatured, the most active, the most complete
[02:21:43.040 --> 02:21:48.440]  and in our opinion, the most powerful in what nature originally put into the fresh raw whey.
[02:21:48.440 --> 02:21:58.840]  It is One World Whey. Call 888-988-3325. That's 888-988-3325. Or visit OneWorldWhey.com. That's
[02:21:58.840 --> 02:22:01.920]  OneWorldW-H-E-Y.com.
[02:22:01.920 --> 02:22:05.720]  Hi, this is Peter Kronschnabel from Midas Resources. As you know, federal government
[02:22:05.720 --> 02:22:10.680]  spending is at an all-time high and inflation will be a direct result of the spending policy.
[02:22:10.680 --> 02:22:14.340]  European government and central bank spending policies have put the European Union on the
[02:22:14.340 --> 02:22:18.060]  brink of collapse. What are you doing right now to protect yourself financially? Are your
[02:22:18.060 --> 02:22:22.640]  assets working for you or against you? One thing is certain, having physical possession
[02:22:22.640 --> 02:22:26.040]  of gold and silver will guarantee that no matter what happens to our economy or the
[02:22:26.040 --> 02:22:30.520]  dollar, your investment will never be worthless. It will protect you from that hidden tax,
[02:22:30.520 --> 02:22:35.160]  inflation. If you've been thinking about investing in physical possession of precious metals
[02:22:35.160 --> 02:22:39.480]  or having an IRA in precious metals, I can help. Call me today, Peter Kronschnabel, at
[02:22:39.480 --> 02:22:46.680]  800-686-2237, extension 108. And I'll take the time to personally put together a portfolio
[02:22:46.680 --> 02:22:53.400]  designed to protect what you've worked so hard for. Call 800-686-2237, extension 108.
[02:22:53.400 --> 02:22:59.680]  You've worked hard your whole life and I want to work hard for you. Call Peter at 800-686-2237,
[02:22:59.680 --> 02:23:00.680]  extension 108.
[02:23:00.680 --> 02:23:05.280]  Hey there, my name is Frank Bates. Do you know the number one most valuable item in
[02:23:05.280 --> 02:23:10.880]  a crisis? Some people think the answer is gold, others think it's a gun, but the correct
[02:23:10.880 --> 02:23:17.620]  answer will shock you. I just created a free video at Crisis123.com that reveals a surprising
[02:23:17.620 --> 02:23:22.700]  item that is more valuable than gold in a crisis. Ninety-seven percent of Americans
[02:23:22.700 --> 02:23:27.080]  don't have this one critical item. In fact, they haven't even given it a thought. And
[02:23:27.080 --> 02:23:32.400]  the sad truth is that you may not survive without it when a real crisis hits and a starving
[02:23:32.400 --> 02:23:36.480]  mob is right outside your door. What I have to tell you could literally make the difference
[02:23:36.480 --> 02:23:42.880]  between life and death for you and your family. Watch my video at Crisis123.com to discover
[02:23:42.880 --> 02:23:48.360]  the number one most valuable item in a crisis. You'll be shocked. See the controversial video
[02:23:48.360 --> 02:23:52.280]  that thousands of other smart patriots have already seen in the last three months. Go
[02:23:52.280 --> 02:23:58.480]  watch my video now at Crisis123.com before they force me to shut it down. Again, that's
[02:23:58.480 --> 02:24:17.160]  Crisis123.com. You know, we do that fourth hour of overdrive from back when I did four
[02:24:17.160 --> 02:24:20.960]  hours every day. Some stations carry it. We've got our guests with us for about 45 minutes
[02:24:20.960 --> 02:24:23.840]  or 40 minutes here, but I may, if they're talk show hosts on their own ride, I'll listen
[02:24:23.840 --> 02:24:28.560]  to them locally on the local FM, which by the way, folks, you just shouldn't expect
[02:24:28.560 --> 02:24:30.160]  AM and FM stations to always be there.
[02:24:30.160 --> 02:24:35.320]  We gain new affiliates all the time, but they change format. They move. And we were on in
[02:24:35.320 --> 02:24:40.400]  Dallas, got them great ratings and they just changed formats. Number one in Orlando went
[02:24:40.400 --> 02:24:45.960]  to sports. So we gained stations, we're growing, but we lose them. So always remember you can
[02:24:45.960 --> 02:24:51.680]  get the free iPhone app at Infowars.com. Okay, we've got Sean Siegel and Marcy Terry on.
[02:24:51.680 --> 02:24:56.480]  I don't normally have lay people. I'm laying my shelves. I have medical, medical doctors,
[02:24:56.480 --> 02:25:01.480]  brain surgeons, epidemiologists, virologists, scientists, you know, the head of the EU virus
[02:25:01.480 --> 02:25:06.780]  program, Dr. Wolfgang Woudarg, all of them. I have them on. They say what this guy says,
[02:25:06.780 --> 02:25:10.600]  but I listen to him. I hear him all the time on the weekend. He's on local 90.1 here in
[02:25:10.600 --> 02:25:15.240]  Austin and I hear him and I just, they know what they're talking about, VaxTruth.org.
[02:25:15.240 --> 02:25:21.440]  So this is a short segment, long segment coming up, but tell us about VaxTruth.org. Sean Siegel
[02:25:21.440 --> 02:25:27.160]  and tell us about, you know, also the lady that we're going to have on with you, Marcy
[02:25:27.160 --> 02:25:31.760]  Terry, who's on via video. Scott, people can see her in just a moment. What woke you up?
[02:25:31.760 --> 02:25:35.680]  Because you're just very articulate. You know what you're talking about. And you know, just
[02:25:35.680 --> 02:25:40.280]  the way you calmly talk about things really touches me. There's a poignance to your voice.
[02:25:40.280 --> 02:25:45.680]  You're not trying to do it, but it just always moves my intellect and my heart when you're
[02:25:45.680 --> 02:25:49.400]  just saying this is happening to our children. I mean, tell people why you got involved.
[02:25:49.400 --> 02:25:55.880]  Okay, and I sure appreciate the opportunity, Alex. I'm a grandfather here in Austin, Texas
[02:25:55.880 --> 02:26:01.120]  and I was 64 years old four years ago when I first found out that a vaccine could literally
[02:26:01.120 --> 02:26:08.520]  kill or debilitate a child for life. That kind of blew me away. At about the same time,
[02:26:08.520 --> 02:26:15.200]  I found myself in a kind of closed little seminar with Dr. Sheri Tenpenny and she informed
[02:26:15.200 --> 02:26:21.600]  me and the rest of us, about eight or nine of us there in the group, that the CDC changed
[02:26:21.600 --> 02:26:26.640]  the definition of polio the year the vaccine was introduced.
[02:26:26.640 --> 02:26:32.260]  That did not sit well with me at all, because that's trickery. That's a magic trick. That's
[02:26:32.260 --> 02:26:39.620]  not disease eradication. That's disease elimination through the stroke of a pen. And that started
[02:26:39.620 --> 02:26:43.240]  me researching, especially having my three kids in town. I now have four grandkids.
[02:26:43.240 --> 02:26:48.440]  That's right, when Bill Gates damages 40 something thousand kids and 60,000 in India, they don't
[02:26:48.440 --> 02:26:54.480]  call it polio, they call it paralysis. Explain what they did to claim the polio vaccine worked.
[02:26:54.480 --> 02:27:00.120]  Explain the whole thing. What they did was they changed the definition of paralytic polio.
[02:27:00.120 --> 02:27:03.960]  There's two components, this is critical. They changed the definition of paralytic polio
[02:27:03.960 --> 02:27:13.440]  from a presence of slight paralysis or partial paralysis over 24 hours to paralysis over
[02:27:13.440 --> 02:27:15.040]  60 days.
[02:27:15.040 --> 02:27:21.440]  What most folks don't know is that even paralytic polio self recovered in two to three weeks.
[02:27:21.440 --> 02:27:27.440]  So that knocked out upwards of two thirds of the cases that would then fourth be labeled
[02:27:27.440 --> 02:27:32.980]  polio. Now the other component, second component, there's actually three in total. Second component
[02:27:32.980 --> 02:27:38.000]  is critical and unbelievable. And it demonstrates the hubris you always mentioned on the air
[02:27:38.000 --> 02:27:46.600]  just perfectly. Non paralytic polio, it made up 55%. I looked up the cases in the years
[02:27:46.600 --> 02:27:51.800]  preceding the introduction of the polio vaccine, 52, 53, 54.
[02:27:51.800 --> 02:27:57.580]  And it made up 55% of the cases reported as polio, non paralytic polio. Non paralytic
[02:27:57.580 --> 02:28:02.800]  polio is like a bad cold. And we're showing graphs from the CDC on screen for viewers.
[02:28:02.800 --> 02:28:08.680]  And non paralytic polio is akin to a mild cold. They don't come and tell you that. They
[02:28:08.680 --> 02:28:15.040]  never tell you that paralytic polio, upwards of two thirds of those cases, would self recover
[02:28:15.040 --> 02:28:16.040]  within two to three weeks.
[02:28:16.040 --> 02:28:19.360]  But then it gets worse. Again, I'm not just going off what you say. This is well known
[02:28:19.360 --> 02:28:27.320]  for vaccine research. This is like the fact that the rock of Gibraltar is out in the ocean.
[02:28:27.320 --> 02:28:31.960]  If you look at this, there was this little goodie in the polio vaccine that hundreds
[02:28:31.960 --> 02:28:36.020]  of millions of Americans and hundreds of millions of foreigners got that had something that
[02:28:36.020 --> 02:28:40.080]  killed people deader than a hammer in it, SV40 cancer virus.
[02:28:40.080 --> 02:28:44.960]  Right, SV40 was detected in 1960. It was on purpose, go ahead.
[02:28:44.960 --> 02:28:52.320]  In 1960, and the most egregious thing there was even after it was detected, they never
[02:28:52.320 --> 02:28:56.320]  even pulled the batches in which they knew the SV40 was pregnant.
[02:28:56.320 --> 02:28:59.640]  And we have the clip of one of the inventors of it laughing and saying, well, there are
[02:28:59.640 --> 02:29:05.040]  too many people and laughing. And he laughs with PBS. It's very funny.
[02:29:05.040 --> 02:29:07.640]  Well, these statistics-
[02:29:07.640 --> 02:29:11.400]  Most people you know, folks, that died of cancer and all these rare cancers that became
[02:29:11.400 --> 02:29:15.320]  suddenly super common, you can thank the government. They murdered your family. Hope you enjoy
[02:29:15.320 --> 02:29:16.320]  it. Go ahead.
[02:29:16.320 --> 02:29:19.520]  Okay, these statistics are one thing, and Marcy Terry will speak to those. She's an
[02:29:19.520 --> 02:29:23.300]  excellent researcher. I go with the issue of trust because that's what struck me that
[02:29:23.300 --> 02:29:24.500]  day with Sherry Tenpenny.
[02:29:24.500 --> 02:29:33.920]  That's what started me on my original research journey. The point is between the changes
[02:29:33.920 --> 02:29:38.200]  made to paralytic polio and non-paralytic polio and what they do with non-paralytic
[02:29:38.200 --> 02:29:42.640]  is they literally changed the definition of non-paralytic polio.
[02:29:42.640 --> 02:29:46.860]  Stay there. We'll expose the giant hoax and we'll have your cohost, Marcy Terry, on with
[02:29:46.860 --> 02:29:50.860]  us right after this quick break. I'm Alex Jones.

[02:33:08.720 --> 02:33:16.160]  during my time here. It came to me when I tried to classify your species and I realized
[02:33:16.160 --> 02:33:25.520]  that you're not actually mammals. Every mammal on this planet instinctively develops a natural
[02:33:25.520 --> 02:33:31.880]  equilibrium with the surrounding environment, but you humans do not. You move to an area
[02:33:31.880 --> 02:33:40.200]  and you multiply. You multiply until every natural resource is consumed. The only way
[02:33:40.200 --> 02:33:53.360]  you can survive is to spread to another area. There is another organism on this planet that
[02:33:53.360 --> 02:34:01.360]  follows the same pattern. They're racist. Do you know what it is? A virus. A virus.
[02:34:01.360 --> 02:34:06.680]  Human beings are a disease. To the elite who want everything. The cancer of this planet.
[02:34:06.680 --> 02:34:19.680]  The elite are really the cancer. We are the cure. Resistance to tyrants is obedience to
[02:34:19.680 --> 02:34:27.640]  God. It's Alex Jones. Monday through Friday, 11 a.m. to 2 p.m.
[02:34:27.640 --> 02:34:33.800]  We're here. We're into the third hour right now. Okay. Sean Siegel, grandfather, again,
[02:34:33.800 --> 02:34:38.320]  researching vaccines, talk show host, Marcy Terry is co-host. We haven't introduced Marcy
[02:34:38.320 --> 02:34:42.640]  yet and I haven't really gotten much into you guys' bio, but keep rolling with the statistics
[02:34:42.640 --> 02:34:46.280]  and then introduce Marcy and you guys kind of have the floor here for a little while.
[02:34:46.280 --> 02:34:52.440]  Okay, thanks. I was at Non-Paralytic Polio. They did the most amazing magical trick and
[02:34:52.440 --> 02:34:57.840]  pulled the incredible rabbit out of a hat. We are told that meningitis is one disease.
[02:34:57.840 --> 02:35:02.720]  Actually, there are two. There's aseptic and viral, so you have a bacterial version and
[02:35:02.720 --> 02:35:07.980]  a viral version. And we were also told that polio is a disease that is caused by the polio
[02:35:07.980 --> 02:35:12.960]  virus. Ostensibly, you should be able to look into a microscope and tell somebody exactly
[02:35:12.960 --> 02:35:19.520]  what it is they have. What they did was they completely relabeled between 1955 and 56 and
[02:35:19.520 --> 02:35:26.520]  65, about a decade, they relabeled all cases of non-paralytic polio as aseptic meningitis.
[02:35:26.520 --> 02:35:31.840]  And this comes from Canada where they had the exact same move. And I wouldn't doubt
[02:35:31.840 --> 02:35:36.600]  that the lady who allowed this in their publication got fired for doing so, but I'll read it.
[02:35:36.600 --> 02:35:41.760]  It says, it may be noted, this is from 1959, by the way, it's called Poliomyelitis Trens
[02:35:41.760 --> 02:35:48.640]  1958. It may be noted that the meeting council of health at its 74th meeting in October of
[02:35:48.640 --> 02:35:54.960]  58 recommended that for the purposes of national reporting and statistics, the term non-paralytic
[02:35:54.960 --> 02:36:02.800]  polio myelitis be replaced by meningitis, viral or aseptic. This is phenomenal. They
[02:36:02.800 --> 02:36:11.560]  erased a diagnosis from the medical dictionary. And when they did that, they erased 55% of
[02:36:11.560 --> 02:36:15.640]  the cases of polio that had been reported on an annual basis before the vaccine was
[02:36:15.640 --> 02:36:16.640]  introduced.
[02:36:16.640 --> 02:36:21.120]  Between the changes to the paralytic polio and the non-paralytic polio, it left about
[02:36:21.120 --> 02:36:29.320]  10% of the cases. So strokes of the pan eliminated 90%. And then the coup de gras, the CDC mandated
[02:36:29.320 --> 02:36:36.760]  the dense fourth, all cases of suspected polio go to them, to the CDC for final analysis.
[02:36:36.760 --> 02:36:41.760]  It's like vaccine damage that they cover up. It's damage control. In this case, the damage
[02:36:41.760 --> 02:36:47.380]  as far as they're concerned is any diagnosis of actual polio. And that's what happened.
[02:36:47.380 --> 02:36:50.960]  And we have a very firm- Yeah, what do they call it now, Guillain-Barre?
[02:36:50.960 --> 02:36:55.760]  Guillain-Barre, Bell's palsy, acute flaccid paralysis- Which they talk about record neurological
[02:36:55.760 --> 02:37:01.520]  disorders. Right, it never disappeared. What happened to polio? Nothing happened to polio.
[02:37:01.520 --> 02:37:05.840]  The symptoms are still there. There are hundreds, probably thousands of people in the country,
[02:37:05.840 --> 02:37:10.680]  as you just said, that are now diagnosed with Guillain-Barre or Bell's palsy or acute flaccid
[02:37:10.680 --> 02:37:16.440]  paralysis, who before the vaccine was introduced- But it's also another fraud. I think what's
[02:37:16.440 --> 02:37:20.240]  happening is his mic's up too high because he's not up on it, and then I'm over here.
[02:37:20.240 --> 02:37:24.760]  That's just a little thing we've noticed. Anyways, getting back to what I was breaking
[02:37:24.760 --> 02:37:31.680]  down here, and we're gonna introduce your co-host. It's very, very important to understand
[02:37:31.680 --> 02:37:35.840]  that there's so many frauds that'll make your head spin. So we're just hitting some of the
[02:37:35.840 --> 02:37:40.760]  highlights here. But it's the same in Australia, Europe here. I've seen all the graphs, mainline
[02:37:40.760 --> 02:37:43.640]  government graphs. I've heard you talk about them. Maybe I'm having that big stack and
[02:37:43.640 --> 02:37:47.880]  the graphics we're showing for TV viewers, but for radio listeners, it was the advent
[02:37:47.880 --> 02:37:53.200]  of sewage treatment. It was the advent of lights. It was the advent of better food.
[02:37:53.200 --> 02:37:59.220]  And you see all sorts of diseases go way down. Then vaccines become popularized, 40s, 50s,
[02:37:59.220 --> 02:38:04.360]  and actual diseases bump up some, but not to the previous level before hygiene. I mean,
[02:38:04.360 --> 02:38:06.560]  people used to dump their crap in the streets.
[02:38:06.560 --> 02:38:11.240]  Exactly, and it was all those improvements in public health and personal hygiene, refrigeration
[02:38:11.240 --> 02:38:18.840]  of food, less toxicity in your diet, that lowered by 95% the disease mortality rates
[02:38:18.840 --> 02:38:25.060]  from about 1915, where they peaked, in the 40s. So by the time the 50s came along, those
[02:38:25.060 --> 02:38:31.120]  childhood diseases that are caricatured now as plagues were not considered plagues at
[02:38:31.120 --> 02:38:34.200]  all. They were just childhood diseases.
[02:38:34.200 --> 02:38:37.520]  Well, they also don't make a big deal out of all the people they're killing with the
[02:38:37.520 --> 02:38:41.640]  vaccines now. Let's bring Marcy Terry, and I know you've been chomping at the bit, Marcy,
[02:38:41.640 --> 02:38:46.040]  joining us via video Skype. Marcy, how did you get into this? And go over some of the
[02:38:46.040 --> 02:38:50.960]  statistics for people. I mean, you guys kind of talk here.
[02:38:50.960 --> 02:38:59.400]  Well, hi, Alex. Thanks for having us. Going over some of the statistics. Well, let me
[02:38:59.400 --> 02:39:06.240]  just start with how I got into this. I'm a mother, and I'm also a grandmother. I live
[02:39:06.240 --> 02:39:13.400]  in Indiana, and I have a daughter who was vaccine injured, and who had a very serious
[02:39:13.400 --> 02:39:22.320]  vaccine injury and almost died a few years back. A couple of years ago, just before school
[02:39:22.320 --> 02:39:28.960]  started here, there was an article in the paper that was written in the Evansville Courier
[02:39:28.960 --> 02:39:34.800]  and Press. On the front page of the paper, it said, it declared, the title was sticking
[02:39:34.800 --> 02:39:41.160]  to the schedule. Basically, it was what's published in mainstream news all over the
[02:39:41.160 --> 02:39:44.920]  place at the beginning of the school years. If your child is not up to date on their vaccines,
[02:39:44.920 --> 02:39:47.280]  they can't go to school. And they lie in hoax and say it's the law
[02:39:47.280 --> 02:39:53.720]  when it's not. Exactly. So I tried to be nice, and I tried
[02:39:53.720 --> 02:40:00.120]  to play and be a good girl. And I called, and I said, can you please just do a follow-up
[02:40:00.120 --> 02:40:04.560]  story because people need to know that they do have rights. They have the right to religious
[02:40:04.560 --> 02:40:07.620]  exemption in the state of Indiana, and they also have the right to medical exemption.
[02:40:07.620 --> 02:40:12.240]  So if their child has a medical reason not to get a vaccine, then they don't have to
[02:40:12.240 --> 02:40:15.920]  get them. And they just flat out refuse. They weren't gonna-
[02:40:15.920 --> 02:40:20.480]  And again, every year before school, every paper in the country that I see runs hoax
[02:40:20.480 --> 02:40:24.680]  article after hoax article, sometimes three in the same issue, saying it's the law, you'll
[02:40:24.680 --> 02:40:28.880]  be arrested. And I read some this year before the school year out of a Dallas paper and
[02:40:28.880 --> 02:40:33.040]  stuff saying, there's never been a problem. It's a conspiracy theory. There are no side
[02:40:33.040 --> 02:40:38.680]  effects. And the insert says can kill you. And I showed the inserts. I mean, it's criminal
[02:40:38.680 --> 02:40:42.520]  lying. They need to be sued. Well, exactly. It is criminal lying, and I
[02:40:42.520 --> 02:40:47.600]  think they do need to be sued. And I think if we started holding the news stations-
[02:40:47.600 --> 02:40:51.240]  These are people that want to make sure they kill your kid. And they kill people with a
[02:40:51.240 --> 02:40:55.980]  papilloma shot all the time. They just love it. They're just murdering us. In Nazi Germany
[02:40:55.980 --> 02:40:59.480]  or Russia, they put you in a pit and shot you. Now they just shoot you up and laugh
[02:40:59.480 --> 02:41:04.260]  about it. Yes, yeah. Well, what happened to your daughter? What'd she take? My uncle almost
[02:41:04.260 --> 02:41:08.880]  died from a tetanus shot back in the 60s. He doesn't have to be told not to take it.
[02:41:08.880 --> 02:41:12.120]  My mom got super sick from a flu shot. She didn't have to be told. What are they going
[02:41:12.120 --> 02:41:18.400]  to do as the armies of people with dead kids or kids that have convulsions or get neurological?
[02:41:18.400 --> 02:41:23.840]  I mean, that's their problem is the army of the people they've damaged or killed grows.
[02:41:23.840 --> 02:41:30.360]  What are they going to do? Well, that's exactly it. And that's the reason
[02:41:30.360 --> 02:41:35.520]  why we're here today. And that's the reason why VaxTruth became an entity at all because
[02:41:35.520 --> 02:41:40.560]  all I started out to do was I just wanted to let people in my area know that it wasn't
[02:41:40.560 --> 02:41:48.000]  true because I could see these people scrambling to go get their kids up to date on vaccines
[02:41:48.000 --> 02:41:54.920]  and the Tdap or the diphtheria tetanus and acellular pertussis or vaccine, it's DTaP
[02:41:54.920 --> 02:41:59.880]  for young kids and then it's Tdap for older kids. That was added to the schedule here
[02:41:59.880 --> 02:42:04.480]  in Indiana a few years ago. And that's the one that almost killed my daughter. She had
[02:42:04.480 --> 02:42:07.920]  a grand mal seizure three hours after she got it. And that's the only vaccine she got
[02:42:07.920 --> 02:42:11.760]  that. Now how old was she when that happened? She was 15. Now see that probably made them
[02:42:11.760 --> 02:42:16.000]  mad if she'd have been six months when they usually had it, they'd have done a scan or
[02:42:16.000 --> 02:42:21.800]  blood on the brain. They could have the fun of not just killing her, usually that happens,
[02:42:21.800 --> 02:42:25.880]  the infant death syndrome, they could have thrown you in jail and had a double goody.
[02:42:25.880 --> 02:42:30.760]  So I guess that was kind of upsetting that she survived and is doing better and that
[02:42:30.760 --> 02:42:36.520]  they couldn't throw you in jail. If she was 15, they could say, mommy didn't beat me.
[02:42:36.520 --> 02:42:42.200]  Right. Well, that's true. And the other thing is that as they're adding these vaccines to
[02:42:42.200 --> 02:42:48.880]  the schedule for older children and adolescents, it's different from when you have a vaccine
[02:42:48.880 --> 02:42:53.300]  injury in a young child because they're not talking yet. They don't have school records.
[02:42:53.300 --> 02:42:57.140]  They don't have the, you know, they're not athletes. They don't have this history that
[02:42:57.140 --> 02:43:01.400]  they carry with them already that shows that they were neurologically intact. They were
[02:43:01.400 --> 02:43:02.400]  developing-
[02:43:02.400 --> 02:43:05.280]  Yeah, that's why they want to hurt them as young as possible. Yeah, they found it's hard
[02:43:05.280 --> 02:43:10.360]  to cover it up. Plus they can't frame you. And that's the real problem for the police
[02:43:10.360 --> 02:43:14.440]  and everybody is they want to throw you in jail. That's the, because that's an extra
[02:43:14.440 --> 02:43:15.440]  fun part.
[02:43:15.440 --> 02:43:20.320]  Well, I'm sorry, but they're not going to, well, I'm not going to, I'm not going to dare
[02:43:20.320 --> 02:43:21.320]  them, but-
[02:43:21.320 --> 02:43:25.140]  Let's talk about SIDS because, you know, now they're having to admit it's the vaccines,
[02:43:25.140 --> 02:43:28.480]  but they, and it really is getting to them now that they can't throw all those parents
[02:43:28.480 --> 02:43:30.280]  in jail after they kill their kids.
[02:43:30.280 --> 02:43:34.720]  Well, there's, yeah, there's still a lot of them sitting in jail right now. SIDS and shaken
[02:43:34.720 --> 02:43:40.480]  baby syndrome that, you know, that these, all of a sudden these wonderful parents who
[02:43:40.480 --> 02:43:45.400]  never had any kind of indication that they were, that they were abusive to their children.
[02:43:45.400 --> 02:43:48.900]  They have older children that have never been abused. And all of a sudden they have a child
[02:43:48.900 --> 02:43:56.040]  that dies within three days of having vaccines. And generally it's after the pertussis vaccine.
[02:43:56.040 --> 02:43:57.040]  They-
[02:43:57.040 --> 02:43:59.280]  And the doctors know that full well. It doesn't matter.
[02:43:59.280 --> 02:44:03.600]  Yeah, they know it. There's too much money involved. There's too much money.
[02:44:03.600 --> 02:44:07.120]  Yeah. This is interesting. One of the guests we had on the show is Dr. Vera Scheibner from
[02:44:07.120 --> 02:44:14.040]  Australia. And 20 years ago, she, she with her husband developed a computerized monitor.
[02:44:14.040 --> 02:44:17.720]  That's why I got you on. Here's what's going to happen. You've got the floor and if you
[02:44:17.720 --> 02:44:22.600]  guys can do it, I'm going to give you the fourth hour, which is a large audience, probably
[02:44:22.600 --> 02:44:26.380]  a million people, three million regularly an hour, because I'm doing this now with really
[02:44:26.380 --> 02:44:27.380]  cool people.
[02:44:27.380 --> 02:44:30.820]  Just giving them the fourth hour, kind of the overdrive. I'm going to give you guys
[02:44:30.820 --> 02:44:33.960]  the floor to really drill into that. Can you guys do the next hour?
[02:44:33.960 --> 02:44:34.960]  Absolutely.
[02:44:34.960 --> 02:44:35.960]  Okay, but-
[02:44:35.960 --> 02:44:36.960]  The two of us.
[02:44:36.960 --> 02:44:40.760]  Absolutely. Give people a little four view. Yeah, because I heard the doctor. I heard
[02:44:40.760 --> 02:44:44.960]  you cover it. In fact, that's why I had them call you also. I want to get her on because
[02:44:44.960 --> 02:44:47.080]  they, they knew what was happening. Go ahead.
[02:44:47.080 --> 02:44:51.300]  Yeah. Oh, is excellent. She and her husband developed a, a, what they called the cut watch
[02:44:51.300 --> 02:44:54.280]  study because in Australia it's called a cut death instead of SIDS.
[02:44:54.280 --> 02:44:56.540]  They wanted to find out why it was happening and they found out.
[02:44:56.540 --> 02:45:01.480]  And parents wanted to find out what was happening. So they hired the, uh, Dr Scheibner and her
[02:45:01.480 --> 02:45:07.960]  husband to run this monitor from birth. Right. And it was a perfect control situation as
[02:45:07.960 --> 02:45:12.580]  Dr Scheibner described, where for the first two months with all these little babies, there,
[02:45:12.580 --> 02:45:18.360]  there was no break in the breathing pattern that, that was detected by the machine. But
[02:45:18.360 --> 02:45:23.200]  seven hours after the first vaccination and was, it was a pattern seven hours after the
[02:45:23.200 --> 02:45:28.000]  first vaccination. And again, about 24 hours later, again, a week or 10 days later, again,
[02:45:28.000 --> 02:45:30.360]  five days after that, there was a pattern.
[02:45:30.360 --> 02:45:38.800]  They, the kids experienced a 95% loss of intake of air. I mean, how critical can you get 95%?
[02:45:38.800 --> 02:45:42.320]  Well, it's designed chemical warfare. It's like the UN got caught adding the hormone
[02:45:42.320 --> 02:45:46.360]  to the tetanus shot. These are all tailor made. Well, and you can see why a baby that
[02:45:46.360 --> 02:45:54.560]  is 95% compromised, laying face down on any surface on a mattress is, is in terrible trouble
[02:45:54.560 --> 02:45:58.760]  is in potentially and you inject them with a chemical weapon and it's causing brainstem
[02:45:58.760 --> 02:46:01.800]  neurological motor controls, break down what they found.
[02:46:01.800 --> 02:46:06.040]  And what they found was, and Dr Scheibner did her, did her, her homework. Uh, she went
[02:46:06.040 --> 02:46:11.880]  to the Australian government, got to statistics, which they had by day by day and found out
[02:46:11.880 --> 02:46:17.440]  that the SIDS incidents matched eerily with the incidents of these 95%.
[02:46:17.440 --> 02:46:22.040]  Well, of course. And, and, and see that now they're saying abort kids up to three. Have
[02:46:22.040 --> 02:46:26.280]  you heard that? That's the journal of pediatrics. This is a great idea. No, no, no. That was
[02:46:26.280 --> 02:46:32.520]  journal of bioethics last year. And so, and euthanasia death panels, those are tests to
[02:46:32.520 --> 02:46:35.400]  see can we kill kids and cover it up and blame them?
[02:46:35.400 --> 02:46:40.560]  This is all a bio weapon attack. Right. Very loving. It certainly feels like that. But,
[02:46:40.560 --> 02:46:44.920]  but we, uh, we, we approach it from trust. I, I trust that the parents out there who
[02:46:44.920 --> 02:46:49.320]  are listening to our show, and by the way, the name of the show is the vaccine myth and
[02:46:49.320 --> 02:46:56.520]  issue of trust. And we are on logosradionetwork.com, uh, every Sunday from two to 4 PM central
[02:46:56.520 --> 02:47:00.640]  daylight time at this point, central time, except we started doing, I think that's the
[02:47:00.640 --> 02:47:04.760]  show you heard last time you listened was on the first Sunday of every month.
[02:47:04.760 --> 02:47:08.640]  We now have the myth of Palooza, which is a four hour show. What you need is people
[02:47:08.640 --> 02:47:13.120]  to go and record your show, get it off the archive and put it on YouTube. We need people
[02:47:13.120 --> 02:47:16.120]  more importantly than nowadays and the way media works. It's not even saying when your
[02:47:16.120 --> 02:47:21.160]  show is on though. That's important is for the activist to push it out to people.
[02:47:21.160 --> 02:47:24.960]  We have it. We have a vaccine myth. No, no, no, no, no. It's very, very exciting. We have
[02:47:24.960 --> 02:47:38.760]  a YouTube channel. Uh, it's H T T P S the secured secure as per secure, um, colon backslash slash slash www.youtube.com slash user slash the vaccine.
[02:47:38.760 --> 02:47:42.720]  Sure. Nobody can write that down. I'm telling you, like, let me just say Vax truth on YouTube.
[02:47:42.720 --> 02:47:47.560]  Yeah, absolutely. Sorry about that. No, no, no. I'm just trying to drop. Everybody always
[02:47:47.560 --> 02:47:50.800]  tries to get up a whole URL. Nobody can. Yeah, I appreciate that. Yes. Indeed. Go to the
[02:47:50.800 --> 02:47:55.880]  vaccine myth. And we have had dr Andy Wakefield. We've had dr Sherry 10, 20, several times.
[02:47:55.880 --> 02:48:00.480]  Uh, one of her good friends and nephrologist who after being quite dismayed after finding
[02:48:00.480 --> 02:48:05.760]  out what her kidney patients were, were suffering after vaccines in the hospital ended up becoming
[02:48:05.760 --> 02:48:09.640]  a homeopath. She now is still, well, I like what you guys are doing because it shows you're
[02:48:09.640 --> 02:48:10.640]  fighting mag.
[02:48:10.640 --> 02:48:13.360]  Marcy, what do you want to say while we're here talking to him, you're going to have
[02:48:13.360 --> 02:48:17.180]  the whole next hour here to talk about, you know, these studies and on the big stack of
[02:48:17.180 --> 02:48:20.920]  stuff you've got. But, uh, I mean, what else do you want to impart to people out there?
[02:48:20.920 --> 02:48:24.840]  But I think it's, this is a giant hoax. I mean, can you trust them if they say it's
[02:48:24.840 --> 02:48:29.320]  the law to take it when it's not, and then they're now moving to make it the law?
[02:48:29.320 --> 02:48:35.000]  Well, exactly. And, and what's happening, Alex is, as you said, that the, the, the army
[02:48:35.000 --> 02:48:39.920]  of parents who have vaccine injured children is growing and it's growing exponentially
[02:48:39.920 --> 02:48:43.800]  and it's growing along. I mean, if you just look at the correlation between the, as, as
[02:48:43.800 --> 02:48:49.040]  the, as the childhood schedule goes up, the number of children who are injured goes up
[02:48:49.040 --> 02:48:54.000]  and the number of parents and family members who have, who watch what happens, um, is also
[02:48:54.000 --> 02:48:59.880]  going up. So, so as those parents, um, you know, parents talk to their friends, parents
[02:48:59.880 --> 02:49:04.640]  talk to other parents, doctors aren't listening to us. The public health is, public health
[02:49:04.640 --> 02:49:08.440]  entities aren't listening to us. The government certainly isn't listening to us. So we have,
[02:49:08.440 --> 02:49:10.560]  um, you know, we're talking to each other.
[02:49:10.560 --> 02:49:14.240]  And when they kill your kid, they're gonna also throw you in a dungeon. So even if you're
[02:49:14.240 --> 02:49:18.440]  not going to listen to us now, when your child has the convulsion, quits breathing and dies
[02:49:18.440 --> 02:49:22.840]  and the cops are putting you in handcuffs, demand the autopsy and the autoimmune response
[02:49:22.840 --> 02:49:26.480]  blood on the brain. Okay. Bring that up. Cause you know, I mean, they've already had the
[02:49:26.480 --> 02:49:29.600]  victory of killing your kid. You didn't listen to us or brain damaging them. You're gonna
[02:49:29.600 --> 02:49:32.160]  need to stay out of prison or they're gonna try to take your other kids.
[02:49:32.160 --> 02:49:34.160]  Well, Marcy's going back.
[02:49:34.160 --> 02:49:38.040]  That's happening now. That is happening now, Alex, as well. And it's, there's, this has
[02:49:38.040 --> 02:49:43.280]  a, this is a continuum. It's, it starts with, starts on, um, actually before the birth of
[02:49:43.280 --> 02:49:47.200]  the child with the administration of the flu vaccine during pregnancy and then hepatitis
[02:49:47.200 --> 02:49:51.680]  B vaccine on the first day of life. And then the first two years, children are injected
[02:49:51.680 --> 02:49:55.120]  with 115 different virus.
[02:49:55.120 --> 02:49:59.380]  Let's talk about that because until four years ago, every insert, every doctor worldwide,
[02:49:59.380 --> 02:50:02.880]  you don't give a pregnant woman shots. They knew it caused miscarriages and brain damage.
[02:50:02.880 --> 02:50:07.160]  Now they say, oh, they need extra. In fact, they're now saying two flu shots and then
[02:50:07.160 --> 02:50:10.760]  it's like, and then it's all, and then, and now the doctors are being told it's normal
[02:50:10.760 --> 02:50:16.720]  to have a convulsion now. Oh, it's, oh, the blood's running out your nose. That's, that's,
[02:50:16.720 --> 02:50:18.040]  that's part of the change coming.
[02:50:18.040 --> 02:50:20.600]  It'll be okay. Take some time on all. It'll be all right.
[02:50:20.600 --> 02:50:24.480]  It's part of the change. It's glorious. So, so yes, we're going to go to break and come
[02:50:24.480 --> 02:50:28.320]  back and get into that in the next hour. What are some of the stuff you guys, for people
[02:50:28.320 --> 02:50:33.760]  listening, some stations don't carry it. Internet only, prisonblinded.tv, infowars.com, audio
[02:50:33.760 --> 02:50:37.840]  podcast, all that a lot of stations do. We'll get into it. I want people to really hear
[02:50:37.840 --> 02:50:46.200]  your truth. VaxTruth.org, Sean Siegel, and of course, Marcy Terry, both here with us.
[02:50:46.200 --> 02:50:51.520]  I'm Alex Jones of infowars.com. And of course we do have 11 memberships for $5.95 to see
[02:50:51.520 --> 02:50:56.600]  the radio show at prisonblinded.tv. And your purchase allows us to fund this launch base
[02:50:56.600 --> 02:51:02.160]  to fight the eugenicists that are engaged in mass extermination with soft kill weapons.
[02:51:02.160 --> 02:51:06.080]  If you're listening, you know your basic freedoms are being threatened every day. If you're
[02:51:06.080 --> 02:51:11.760]  listening, you know the economy is not getting better. You know gas and food prices are skyrocketing.

[02:54:22.040 --> 02:54:31.400]  All right, putting some bookends on the main transmission. We're going to an hour of overdrive,
[02:54:31.400 --> 02:54:37.460]  which a lot of stations do carry. Here with our guest, Sean Siegel and of course, Marcy
[02:54:37.460 --> 02:54:41.360]  Terry, just very articulate people I've probably listened to 10, 15 times and everything they
[02:54:41.360 --> 02:54:46.160]  talk about is just dead on, hardcore, all the truth, they really get it. And you know,
[02:54:46.160 --> 02:54:50.000]  I get really nasty about this. I mean, let me tell you something. I know people who've
[02:54:50.000 --> 02:54:52.840]  had their kids' brain damaged and had the cops come and say, you must have beaten your
[02:54:52.840 --> 02:54:57.020]  kid and stuff, you must have. And this was in more recent times, so then the vaccine
[02:54:57.020 --> 02:55:00.880]  issues known, so the hospital may go, well, it might have been a reaction, but they have
[02:55:00.880 --> 02:55:05.680]  a secret payout fund where they pay it out by secret. It's never on the news, the vaccine
[02:55:05.680 --> 02:55:06.680]  damage fund.
[02:55:06.680 --> 02:55:10.820]  They know and the heads of hospitals knows. I mean, I had nurses, last child I had, she's
[02:55:10.820 --> 02:55:15.640]  five now, pressure us to take shots. And at the end of it, they go, oh yeah, we're listeners,
[02:55:15.640 --> 02:55:19.700]  our kids don't take them. I mean, they all know, they're told to do this. And so now
[02:55:19.700 --> 02:55:23.360]  they wanna make, they have a Texas bill to get into the bills, to make everybody take
[02:55:23.360 --> 02:55:24.360]  shots, all of it.
[02:55:24.360 --> 02:55:28.360]  You guys are gonna have the floor, but you were getting into something really powerful
[02:55:28.360 --> 02:55:33.840]  Marcy as we went to break. Do you remember what that was? Cuz I've talked so much I forget.
[02:55:33.840 --> 02:55:36.200]  What was that last point you were trying to get into when we went to break?
[02:55:36.200 --> 02:55:43.520]  Well, what I was saying is that it's really a continuum and what's happening is that those
[02:55:43.520 --> 02:55:50.800]  children who emerge from the first two years in which they get the 115 vaccine antigens,
[02:55:50.800 --> 02:55:54.080]  not to even to talk about the toxins that are in the vaccine.
[02:55:54.080 --> 02:55:56.840]  Oh, you look at them, they're zombies. The kids are zombies now.
[02:55:56.840 --> 02:56:02.520]  And then they get to kindergarten and they survive another onslaught, but a lot of them
[02:56:02.520 --> 02:56:07.840]  are really vaccine damage. They're vaccine injured. We have a whole continuum of neurological
[02:56:07.840 --> 02:56:12.280]  and immune system disorders. And these kids have gastrointestinal problems. They have
[02:56:12.280 --> 02:56:19.160]  all kinds of physical problems. They have circulatory problems. They have digestive
[02:56:19.160 --> 02:56:20.960]  issues. They have excretory problems.
[02:56:20.960 --> 02:56:25.320]  If they can't get you in the criminal system, the judiciary, they're getting you in the
[02:56:25.320 --> 02:56:27.320]  medical system.
[02:56:27.320 --> 02:56:33.560]  Well they get you out. If your kid is so sick that they can't go to school, then they get
[02:56:33.560 --> 02:56:38.920]  you out of the job market. So you're at home 24 seven. Then you've got-
[02:56:38.920 --> 02:56:43.760]  Foreign globalists took over and are engaged in soft kill operations. And John P. Holden
[02:56:43.760 --> 02:56:47.800]  wrote about it in the White House book, Ecoscience. You guys are going to have the floor in the
[02:56:47.800 --> 02:56:51.560]  next hour. I want you to go back through all of this in more detail. You'll have the floor.
[02:56:51.560 --> 02:56:56.760]  But Mr. Siegel, I mean, this is painful for us. Don't people realize this isn't a game
[02:56:56.760 --> 02:56:58.440]  if you're a new listener?
[02:56:58.440 --> 02:57:04.380]  It is very, very painful. I'll just point out one particular instance, a fellow we had
[02:57:04.380 --> 02:57:09.680]  on the air. He's present every time because his music fills the air as we come on the
[02:57:09.680 --> 02:57:14.240]  second hour. The song he sings, the group is called The Refusers, by the way. And the
[02:57:14.240 --> 02:57:17.520]  song which Mr. Belkin sings is of the death of his five-week-old daughter.
[02:57:17.520 --> 02:57:18.520]  Good God.
[02:57:18.520 --> 02:57:24.720]  What happened was, at that point, 1998, there was no mandated day of birth hep B vaccine.
[02:57:24.720 --> 02:57:30.240]  So his daughter, Lila Rose, was healthy, beautiful, vibrant little girl at five weeks.
[02:57:30.240 --> 02:57:31.240]  Good God.
[02:57:31.240 --> 02:57:38.640]  He had the vaccine, and 15 hours later, was dead. And two days later, two days later,
[02:57:38.640 --> 02:57:43.580]  the coroner office called the house and told them they had found brain damage. Brain damage
[02:57:43.580 --> 02:57:46.600]  is expected as a vaccine injury.
[02:57:46.600 --> 02:57:47.960]  It's on the insert.
[02:57:47.960 --> 02:57:50.040]  The Merck Manual lists vaccines-
[02:57:50.040 --> 02:57:51.040]  But they won't do it.
[02:57:51.040 --> 02:57:59.320]  As a cause of encephalitis. Well, talk about injury to insult, and insult to injury. Two
[02:57:59.320 --> 02:58:03.480]  days later, Mr. Belkin found himself in front of the very same woman who had told him that
[02:58:03.480 --> 02:58:09.080]  on the phone, being told by her, while being monitored by her supervisor, that they had
[02:58:09.080 --> 02:58:16.000]  changed their minds. They were going to list it as a SIDS death, which they did. And subsequently,
[02:58:16.000 --> 02:58:21.680]  in the years since, there has been no sign anywhere of the brain damage. They erased
[02:58:21.680 --> 02:58:26.360]  it from the books. And that's the part that everybody has to realize, is the insidious-
[02:58:26.360 --> 02:58:29.560]  The criminal coverup. They know.
[02:58:29.560 --> 02:58:30.560]  It came down.
[02:58:30.560 --> 02:58:33.560]  They know. They love it.
[02:58:33.560 --> 02:58:34.560]  Down from the supervisor.
[02:58:34.560 --> 02:58:35.560]  Good God.
[02:58:35.560 --> 02:58:36.560]  The conversation-
[02:58:36.560 --> 02:58:39.640]  Stay there. You're going to be back in one minute. Infowars.com audio streams, folks.
[02:58:39.640 --> 02:58:40.640]  Great job, group.

[03:00:22.960 --> 03:00:33.760]  This is the Alex Jones Show. I am Sean Siegel, the host of the vaccine myth and issue of
[03:00:33.760 --> 03:00:41.800]  Trust, which is indeed on Logos Radio Network from 2 to 4 p.m. That's at LogosRadioNetwork.com
[03:00:41.800 --> 03:00:50.880]  every Sunday, Central Daylight Time. I'm here with Marcy. Marcy, you still with us?
[03:00:50.880 --> 03:00:56.560]  Marcy Terry should be here with me. I'm not quite sure why she isn't, but hopefully she
[03:00:56.560 --> 03:01:00.720]  will be joining us back here in just a few minutes.
[03:01:00.720 --> 03:01:04.760]  I'm here, Sean. Can you see me or hear me? Oh, dynamite. Yeah, I can hear you at the
[03:01:04.760 --> 03:01:07.320]  moment. I can't see you. All right, I'm here. I'm here.
[03:01:07.320 --> 03:01:13.000]  I would like you to continue. We never got really into the story of VaxTruth and the
[03:01:13.000 --> 03:01:20.440]  billboards that were the result of parents, indeed, who were in greater and greater numbers
[03:01:20.440 --> 03:01:28.080]  experiencing damage to their children by vaccines, which led you to your billboard campaign.
[03:01:28.080 --> 03:01:32.320]  Did you get into that? Yes. Well, what I was saying is in August
[03:01:32.320 --> 03:01:39.520]  of 2011, a little bit more than a year and a half ago, they were gearing up for the beginning
[03:01:39.520 --> 03:01:43.520]  of the school year, as they do every year, and the newspaper ran an article on the front
[03:01:43.520 --> 03:01:48.920]  page that was entitled, Sticking to the Shots, or no, Sticking to the Schedule. I'm sorry.
[03:01:48.920 --> 03:01:55.800]  What it stated was what newspapers across the country and major news outlets, television
[03:01:55.800 --> 03:02:00.680]  outlets, and that kind of thing, say every year, your child cannot go to school if they
[03:02:00.680 --> 03:02:06.160]  are not fully vaccinated according to the CDC schedule, period. That's not true.
[03:02:06.160 --> 03:02:14.080]  In 48 states, parents are entitled to religious exemptions from vaccinations, and in about
[03:02:14.080 --> 03:02:18.320]  20 to 25 states, I'm not exactly sure how many it is at this moment, there are also
[03:02:18.320 --> 03:02:24.160]  philosophical exemptions. The only two states in the United States that do not provide religious
[03:02:24.160 --> 03:02:30.320]  exemptions are Mississippi and West Virginia. Living in Indiana, I know that we have religious
[03:02:30.320 --> 03:02:37.680]  exemptions from vaccines, and both of my daughters have religious exemptions. I was slow to wake
[03:02:37.680 --> 03:02:45.760]  up. My daughter almost died as a result of my slow learning curve.
[03:02:45.760 --> 03:02:51.240]  That's a great sign we're looking at right now. No shots, no school, not true.
[03:02:51.240 --> 03:02:56.560]  Well, what happened was I tried to get the newspaper to print a retraction or to at least
[03:02:56.560 --> 03:03:00.200]  do a follow-up story, letting people know, letting parents know that they don't have
[03:03:00.200 --> 03:03:04.200]  to race out and get their kids vaccinated in such a rush because they have to go to
[03:03:04.200 --> 03:03:10.120]  school. There are a lot of single-parent families. There are a lot of families who don't have
[03:03:10.120 --> 03:03:16.180]  the option to stay home and homeschool. They have to work, and their kids have to go to
[03:03:16.180 --> 03:03:21.720]  school. When the newspaper puts something out that says, your kids can't go to school
[03:03:21.720 --> 03:03:25.960]  unless they're fully vaccinated, parents go in droves to the health department and they
[03:03:25.960 --> 03:03:31.400]  get their kids vaccinated and then don't look into it. They're not making informed decisions.
[03:03:31.400 --> 03:03:37.880]  Putting it out there like that is coercion. It's like holding a gun to your head and saying,
[03:03:37.880 --> 03:03:40.760]  you have to vaccinate or else, and that's just not right.
[03:03:40.760 --> 03:03:49.760]  It's a misrepresentation of the law by the very people whom your tax dollars are supporting,
[03:03:49.760 --> 03:03:54.000]  which should be criminal in itself. They're giving you half the law. They're not telling
[03:03:54.000 --> 03:03:59.620]  you that what they first say actually is countered by the rest of the law. They don't tell you
[03:03:59.620 --> 03:04:04.960]  about the religious exemption and indeed in 20 or 25 of the states, including Texas, the
[03:04:04.960 --> 03:04:13.080]  philosophical exemption as well. And it's insidious that parents, because IMD, some
[03:04:13.080 --> 03:04:18.160]  of the billboards up here, you've seen the one that says, no shots, no school, not true,
[03:04:18.160 --> 03:04:19.160]  vaccines can damage.
[03:04:19.160 --> 03:04:23.760]  I put that up here in Austin last year, and it was covered by KI News that night. It was
[03:04:23.760 --> 03:04:30.440]  very well covered. But what in the world are we doing? What are we doing where parents
[03:04:30.440 --> 03:04:39.480]  have to do the job of the government, okay? It's shameful is what it is. And it's the
[03:04:39.480 --> 03:04:45.300]  story of the trust. That's why we call the show The Vaccine Myth an issue of trust. You
[03:04:45.300 --> 03:04:50.280]  cannot trust the CDC. You cannot trust all those powers to be that are giving you the
[03:04:50.280 --> 03:04:55.120]  misinformation, disinformation, and suppressing a lot of information.
[03:04:55.120 --> 03:05:01.760]  This is infowars.com. We'll be back after a short break.

[03:08:01.700 --> 03:08:07.620]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show because there's
[03:08:07.620 --> 03:08:18.260]  a war on for your mind. Okay, welcome back to the Overdrive Hour on
[03:08:18.260 --> 03:08:23.700]  Ufowars.com. I am Sean Siegel. I'm the host of the Vaccine Myth and Issue of Trust. It's
[03:08:23.700 --> 03:08:28.680]  a weekly radio internet show and you can access our archives by going to YouTube and looking
[03:08:28.680 --> 03:08:35.360]  up the Vaccine Myth channel. And you'll see all of our individual audio interviews such
[03:08:35.360 --> 03:08:42.240]  as with Dr. Andrew Wakefield, with Dr. Sherry Tenpenny, many more, nutrition pharmacist,
[03:08:42.240 --> 03:08:47.260]  not doctor, but Ben Fuchs. All of these folks, of course, you've seen and heard on Alex's
[03:08:47.260 --> 03:08:54.800]  show. Marcy, you were talking about the billboards. How many billboards now have there been around
[03:08:54.800 --> 03:08:58.220]  the country? Well, I was counting the other day. I think
[03:08:58.220 --> 03:09:03.700]  we have 12 or 13 billboards that we have put up. We've got another one that will go up
[03:09:03.700 --> 03:09:11.100]  this month in Logansport, Indiana. We started out in Evansville. We had two billboards in
[03:09:11.100 --> 03:09:16.320]  Evansville that ran for nine days in August of 2011. And then there was the billboard
[03:09:16.320 --> 03:09:24.140]  in Austin that you spearheaded for us. Then there was a billboard that was in Colorado
[03:09:24.140 --> 03:09:35.620]  and then with the billboard in Texas and again in Austin. The largest market that we have
[03:09:35.620 --> 03:09:40.860]  covered thus far, we had six billboards in Los Angeles last year.
[03:09:40.860 --> 03:09:44.580]  Okay, good. And they stayed up for like five or six weeks. Is that correct?
[03:09:44.580 --> 03:09:48.780]  No, the ones in Los Angeles, I wish we could have afforded five or six weeks. The ones
[03:09:48.780 --> 03:09:53.380]  in Los Angeles were for one week. They went up, they were for one week. That's a very
[03:09:53.380 --> 03:09:58.660]  expensive market and we're so small. So I'm really glad and thankful that we have this
[03:09:58.660 --> 03:10:03.780]  opportunity to be on Info Wars because it helps to get the word out.
[03:10:03.780 --> 03:10:13.660]  As I was saying, my goal initially as a mother was just to try to educate my local market.
[03:10:13.660 --> 03:10:18.700]  Evansville has about 150,000 people in the metro area and we're a tri-state. So we have
[03:10:18.700 --> 03:10:24.300]  a lot of rural communities and smaller communities in Kentucky and Illinois that are also dependent
[03:10:24.300 --> 03:10:30.620]  on our newspaper. It's the only major source of news for a lot of families. And for them
[03:10:30.620 --> 03:10:35.540]  to misrepresent the truth about vaccines and education in schools, children being able
[03:10:35.540 --> 03:10:37.680]  to go to schools, was just unacceptable to me.
[03:10:37.680 --> 03:10:43.560]  So my goal was, again, just to put up billboards because they weren't going to do it. And so
[03:10:43.560 --> 03:10:50.860]  I asked my Facebook friends to help me. I got some amazing help from an angel named
[03:10:50.860 --> 03:11:03.660]  Max. Max is a little boy or was a little boy. He was 22 months old when he died as a result
[03:11:03.660 --> 03:11:13.620]  of vaccine injuries. And thanks to Max and his father, I was able to raise enough money
[03:11:13.620 --> 03:11:21.700]  in 24 hours to put up the billboards in Evansville, which interestingly, the total fee for that
[03:11:21.700 --> 03:11:24.980]  was 1984. It was $1,984.
[03:11:24.980 --> 03:11:26.380]  Phenomenal coincidence.
[03:11:26.380 --> 03:11:28.580]  Yeah, it was a coincidence.
[03:11:28.580 --> 03:11:35.460]  Folks out there, you have to appreciate this. Marcy, and certainly I was participating.
[03:11:35.460 --> 03:11:39.920]  Marcy was raising money through Facebook from other parents to put up billboards around
[03:11:39.920 --> 03:11:47.940]  the country to give parents the information that should, by any responsible public authority,
[03:11:47.940 --> 03:11:54.660]  have been provided them without this sort of absurd participation by the parents. It's
[03:11:54.660 --> 03:12:01.620]  just incredible that putting in 5, 10 bucks at a time from how many people and once in
[03:12:01.620 --> 03:12:06.060]  a while getting a larger donation, be able to put up the monies here.
[03:12:06.060 --> 03:12:11.820]  I, for instance, funded the first one here, and I believe I was repaid by some of it at
[03:12:11.820 --> 03:12:19.260]  least from monies that were given to vaxtruth.org. And that's why vaxtruth.org started. I want
[03:12:19.260 --> 03:12:24.420]  to go back to just one issue of trust. And indeed, the vaccine myth and issue of trust
[03:12:24.420 --> 03:12:33.020]  is dedicated to issues of trust. That is, we should expect, we do expect, as parents,
[03:12:33.020 --> 03:12:38.860]  as grandparents, we demand that our public health authorities, that our school systems,
[03:12:38.860 --> 03:12:44.020]  that our doctors, that the CDC, that the AEP, that the folks at the Children's Hospital
[03:12:44.020 --> 03:12:50.300]  of Philadelphia, be honest with us and give all the information that is due a parent under
[03:12:50.300 --> 03:12:53.220]  the precept of informed consent.
[03:12:53.220 --> 03:12:57.220]  Exactly. Informed consent is a huge issue, and I'd like to touch on that just for a minute.
[03:12:57.220 --> 03:12:58.540]  Please do.
[03:12:58.540 --> 03:13:03.380]  We were talking about, as Alex was talking about, vaccine injuries. And I mentioned that
[03:13:03.380 --> 03:13:09.580]  my daughter, the thing that precipitated this for me was my daughter's vaccine injury. It
[03:13:09.580 --> 03:13:17.260]  was very significant. It happened within the major, the last one, the last vaccine injury
[03:13:17.260 --> 03:13:24.880]  for her was within three hours of receiving a Tdap vaccine. And she had a grand mal seizure.
[03:13:24.880 --> 03:13:31.300]  She fell off the bed and hit her head. She stopped breathing while I held her head in
[03:13:31.300 --> 03:13:40.220]  my hands. Thankfully, she was resuscitated. And we went to the hospital in an ambulance.
[03:13:40.220 --> 03:13:45.540]  And while we were in the ambulance, I called our family doctor who had given her the vaccine.
[03:13:45.540 --> 03:13:50.620]  And I called his office and I said, I want this reported to VAERS, Vaccine Adverse Events
[03:13:50.620 --> 03:13:56.420]  Reporting System, as vaccine injury. We went to the hospital. They knew it was a vaccine
[03:13:56.420 --> 03:14:01.100]  injury. I told them what happened. It was months later that I realized that it had not
[03:14:01.100 --> 03:14:06.900]  been reported. When I called my doctor's office, I said, you know, why didn't you report this?
[03:14:06.900 --> 03:14:11.040]  And they said, well, you didn't bring her back here. They said, we didn't have to report
[03:14:11.040 --> 03:14:13.900]  it because you didn't bring her back here. I said, I didn't bring her back there because
[03:14:13.900 --> 03:14:18.140]  she stopped breathing. We went to the hospital in an ambulance. And so they said, well, it
[03:14:18.140 --> 03:14:21.900]  was the hospital that should have reported it. So I called the hospital and I said, well,
[03:14:21.900 --> 03:14:26.740]  why didn't you report it? And they said, well, we didn't administer the vaccine. The administering
[03:14:26.740 --> 03:14:28.180]  physician should have reported it.
[03:14:28.180 --> 03:14:30.340]  So the hot potato showed up.
[03:14:30.340 --> 03:14:35.300]  Exactly. So I called VAERS. Well, I called the Health and Human Services and the VAERS
[03:14:35.300 --> 03:14:39.760]  office. And I asked the woman who answered the phone, I said, so whose responsibility
[03:14:39.760 --> 03:14:45.580]  is it to report vaccine injuries? And she said, well, either one. And I told her the
[03:14:45.580 --> 03:14:49.080]  situation. She said, either one should have reported. And I said, well, isn't that mandatory
[03:14:49.080 --> 03:14:53.620]  according to the law? And she said, yes. And I said, so what are the consequences when
[03:14:53.620 --> 03:14:57.780]  physicians fail to report? And she said, well, there are no consequences. I said, that's
[03:14:57.780 --> 03:15:02.420]  not a law. If there are no consequences, that's a suggestion. That's not a law.
[03:15:02.420 --> 03:15:03.420]  Absolutely.
[03:15:03.420 --> 03:15:11.380]  And for this reason, because it's not enforced and there are no consequences, the number
[03:15:11.380 --> 03:15:17.940]  of vaccine injuries, the percentage is somewhere estimated to be between 1 and 10 percent.
[03:15:17.940 --> 03:15:22.220]  And it's probably between 1 and 2 percent of vaccine injuries that are reported.
[03:15:22.220 --> 03:15:27.260]  So when you're talking about informed consent, informed consent for vaccination requires
[03:15:27.260 --> 03:15:33.180]  that you have the information that you need in order to make an accurate risk benefit
[03:15:33.180 --> 03:15:34.180]  analysis.
[03:15:34.180 --> 03:15:36.900]  Right. And for your own child.
[03:15:36.900 --> 03:15:41.660]  If we don't have the information about how common vaccine injuries are, because there
[03:15:41.660 --> 03:15:46.700]  is no consequence for, there are no consequences for physicians who fail to report them, even
[03:15:46.700 --> 03:15:52.540]  in situations where the vaccine clearly is the cause of the injury, as in it happened
[03:15:52.540 --> 03:15:54.620]  within hours or minutes.
[03:15:54.620 --> 03:16:00.500]  You know, a child gets a vaccination and falls dead in the doctor's office and the doctors
[03:16:00.500 --> 03:16:03.820]  don't report it as a vaccine injury. Well, that's just a coincidence.
[03:16:03.820 --> 03:16:04.820]  Yeah.
[03:16:04.820 --> 03:16:06.420]  They could have died anyway.
[03:16:06.420 --> 03:16:07.420]  It should be indictable.
[03:16:07.420 --> 03:16:12.420]  It should be indictable. And until that law is enforced, we don't have the information
[03:16:12.420 --> 03:16:17.500]  we need to make accurate risk benefit analyses. If we can't make accurate risk benefit analyses,
[03:16:17.500 --> 03:16:23.020]  then we don't have informed consent, which means we are being coerced. We are being lied
[03:16:23.020 --> 03:16:30.300]  to and we are making decisions that are uninformed. As parents, we're making decisions that are
[03:16:30.300 --> 03:16:35.220]  uninformed through no fault of our own and we're simultaneously being told, you have
[03:16:35.220 --> 03:16:37.240]  to do this or your kid can't go to school.
[03:16:37.240 --> 03:16:43.740]  And in some cases, we're being told, parents are being threatened by physicians, by pediatricians.
[03:16:43.740 --> 03:16:47.980]  They go to the pediatrician's office and the pediatrician says, if you don't comply, I'm
[03:16:47.980 --> 03:16:52.820]  going to call CPS. Those threats are happening every day and in some cases, they're following
[03:16:52.820 --> 03:16:54.220]  through on those threats.
[03:16:54.220 --> 03:16:57.020]  Parents are scared. They're scared to the point where they're not even taking their
[03:16:57.020 --> 03:17:03.980]  kids to the doctor because doctors are threatening them with taking their kids away. And this
[03:17:03.980 --> 03:17:08.460]  is happening not only with vaccines at the one end of the spectrum. What I was trying
[03:17:08.460 --> 03:17:14.140]  to say is we've got kids whose parents already have vaccines and injured children and they've
[03:17:14.140 --> 03:17:17.780]  learned their lesson and they've done their research and so now they have new children
[03:17:17.780 --> 03:17:23.620]  and they're trying to find doctors to cover their care, just their basic care, and they
[03:17:23.620 --> 03:17:27.720]  take them to pediatricians because pediatricians are firing them from practice so they're leaving
[03:17:27.720 --> 03:17:35.300]  them without care. And that's against the AAP's own statement, their own policy, but
[03:17:35.300 --> 03:17:39.600]  it's happening all the time. So parents are left trying to find doctors.
[03:17:39.600 --> 03:17:44.100]  Now they've got kids who are vaccine injured and have serious medical problems and their
[03:17:44.100 --> 03:17:48.540]  children are not being treated for those medical problems. These children who have autism diagnoses
[03:17:48.540 --> 03:17:53.820]  and who have gastrointestinal problems and who have immune system problems and who have
[03:17:53.820 --> 03:17:59.580]  all of these systemic train wreck issues, their parents are scared to take them to the
[03:17:59.580 --> 03:18:04.400]  doctors because doctors are turning his parents into CPS because they're refusing treatment.
[03:18:04.400 --> 03:18:10.140]  This is what's happening right now in Chicago with a young man named Alex Sportalakis whose
[03:18:10.140 --> 03:18:14.300]  mother has been trying for almost four weeks now to get him adequate treatment for his
[03:18:14.300 --> 03:18:19.460]  gastrointestinal problems. The doctors aren't treating his gastrointestinal problems. He's
[03:18:19.460 --> 03:18:25.180]  had vomiting and diarrhea, has been stuck for almost two weeks in the ER department
[03:18:25.180 --> 03:18:31.180]  without ever going to a room, chained to a bed because he's aggressive. He's 14 years
[03:18:31.180 --> 03:18:37.260]  old. He's non-verbal. He has autism and his gastrointestinal problems, diarrhea and vomiting,
[03:18:37.260 --> 03:18:41.100]  he hasn't even been evaluated for that. And of course he's aggressive. He has terrible,
[03:18:41.100 --> 03:18:45.980]  terrible physical problems. Of course he's aggressive. He's in pain. He can't express
[03:18:45.980 --> 03:18:51.940]  himself. He's 14 years old. He's probably strong. And so he's presenting a problem.
[03:18:51.940 --> 03:18:55.980]  But the problem is that they are not dealing with what you, Marcie, and eventually we will
[03:18:55.980 --> 03:19:00.880]  get into this, what you are beginning to deal with, which is the fact that all these sensory
[03:19:00.880 --> 03:19:08.040]  process disorders, autism, all of these neurological disorders can be treated. They are medical
[03:19:08.040 --> 03:19:11.580]  problems. They are not genetic problems. They are medical problems.
[03:19:11.580 --> 03:19:16.480]  It's not mental. It's physical. It's not mental. It's physical. I'll go to one of the issues
[03:19:16.480 --> 03:19:22.180]  of trust we had on the vaccine myth and issue of trust. When we had Dr. Wakefield on, I
[03:19:22.180 --> 03:19:28.100]  was quick to bring him into the arena that he loves because what folks don't realize
[03:19:28.100 --> 03:19:37.220]  is there's all the hullabaloo about the supposed ethical charges against Dr. Wakefield. His
[03:19:37.220 --> 03:19:43.940]  license was removed. Indeed it was. But what no one tells you, when we'll be back in just
[03:19:43.940 --> 03:19:48.140]  a few seconds, it will be a break soon. And when we come back, I'll tell you what it is
[03:19:48.140 --> 03:19:54.340]  that no one told you that should have been trumpeted, should have been trumpeted internationally
[03:19:54.340 --> 03:19:58.100]  on headlines everywhere, because that's the news that came out of that experiment that
[03:19:58.100 --> 03:20:01.340]  should have been told and wasn't. We'll be right back.
[03:20:01.340 --> 03:20:08.020]  Hello, I'm Alex Jones. Myself, my family, the Infowars.com team want to relay to you

[03:24:23.620 --> 03:24:28.380]  Okay you are listening to the Alex Jones Show. We're in the fourth overdrive hour. Alex's
[03:24:28.380 --> 03:24:37.220]  websites are infowars.com, prisonplanet.com, and you can watch everything live at prisonplanet.tv.
[03:24:37.220 --> 03:24:43.780]  I am Sean Siegel. I am the host of the weekly radio slash internet show, The Vaccine Myth
[03:24:43.780 --> 03:24:49.820]  and Issue of Trust. I'm here with Marcy Piper-Tury. She is a researcher extraordinaire. She's
[03:24:49.820 --> 03:24:57.300]  the mom of a vaccine-damaged daughter, and she is the founder and director of VaxTruth.org.
[03:24:57.300 --> 03:25:02.640]  Before I go back to the Dr. Wakefield issue I was going to cover, let me talk one moment
[03:25:02.640 --> 03:25:08.600]  about VAERS that Marcy spoke to just a few minutes ago. Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting
[03:25:08.600 --> 03:25:17.640]  System was set up with the legislation in, I believe it was 1974, that took the liability
[03:25:17.640 --> 03:25:23.060]  for vaccine damage out of the hands of the vaccine manufacturers. It ostensibly is a
[03:25:23.060 --> 03:25:28.180]  recording mechanism that is essential, otherwise they wouldn't have set it up. It's supposed
[03:25:28.180 --> 03:25:36.000]  to record and monitor all of those longer-term reactions, the adverse reactions to vaccines.
[03:25:36.000 --> 03:25:44.260]  At the moment, there are over 5,000 reported suspected vaccine-associated deaths in the
[03:25:44.260 --> 03:25:50.540]  VAERS system. There are something like 7,000 permanent injuries. There are close to 10,000
[03:25:50.540 --> 03:25:58.660]  hospitalizations and in the tens of thousands of prolonged hospitalizations and trips to
[03:25:58.660 --> 03:26:04.980]  the emergency room. Doctors will tell you and public health officials will tell you
[03:26:04.980 --> 03:26:13.340]  that in regards to those VAERS reports, that correlation doesn't equal causation. Well,
[03:26:13.340 --> 03:26:19.860]  strictly speaking, that is true, but ethically speaking, it is not. A correlation, as we
[03:26:19.860 --> 03:26:25.900]  all know, both by common sense and by the definition of correlation, is a relationship
[03:26:25.900 --> 03:26:32.420]  not expected to exist on the basis of chance alone. It's not expected, statistically speaking,
[03:26:32.420 --> 03:26:38.040]  to be a coincidence. When you put on top of that the fact that, as Marcy said before,
[03:26:38.040 --> 03:26:43.320]  and the Journal of the American Medical Association printed years ago in one of their articles
[03:26:43.320 --> 03:26:50.820]  it was a conclusion of a study that was 1% of actual serious adverse vaccine reactions
[03:26:50.820 --> 03:26:52.380]  ever get reported.
[03:26:52.380 --> 03:27:00.080]  So what's the possibility? How many deaths actually have occurred from vaccines? 5,000
[03:27:00.080 --> 03:27:05.620]  are listed as suspected. And you have to assume if you're going to make an assumption at all
[03:27:05.620 --> 03:27:09.620]  because of the nature of correlation, you have to assume unless you have proof to the
[03:27:09.620 --> 03:27:16.660]  contrary in every particular instance that every one of those is indeed causally related
[03:27:16.660 --> 03:27:18.300]  to the vaccines.
[03:27:18.300 --> 03:27:25.580]  Sean, I'd like to just say too that when you're talking about deaths from vaccines, the hepatitis
[03:27:25.580 --> 03:27:32.400]  B vaccine alone, the hepatitis B vaccine, which is a vaccination for... Hepatitis B
[03:27:32.400 --> 03:27:37.400]  is a sexually transmitted disease. It's transmitted the same way as other sexually transmitted
[03:27:37.400 --> 03:27:46.040]  diseases that are blood-borne illnesses. It's through sex and through sharing of needles.
[03:27:46.040 --> 03:27:50.720]  There is absolutely no rationale for giving hepatitis B vaccine to infants, particularly
[03:27:50.720 --> 03:27:53.460]  if their mothers are not positive for hepatitis B.
[03:27:53.460 --> 03:27:55.620]  Right, which is by far most...
[03:27:55.620 --> 03:28:00.960]  Women are screened. They know if the mother's positive or not. But the hepatitis B vaccine
[03:28:00.960 --> 03:28:06.100]  alone, the last time I looked, and it's been a while, I think it was December the last
[03:28:06.100 --> 03:28:12.220]  time I looked at it, but there were more than 800 deaths in infants under the age of three.
[03:28:12.220 --> 03:28:15.380]  And most of those, 90 something percent of those were in infants under the age of six
[03:28:15.380 --> 03:28:19.860]  months. Those are deaths that have been reported from the hepatitis B vaccine.
[03:28:19.860 --> 03:28:24.000]  The other thing I want to say about that is there was, and I haven't been able to find
[03:28:24.000 --> 03:28:29.760]  this article again, but I remember not... It's been a while back, but there was an article
[03:28:29.760 --> 03:28:36.100]  that was written by a former emergency room physician. And he was a practicing physician
[03:28:36.100 --> 03:28:43.600]  I think for about 20 years. And he wrote this article that stated that during the time when
[03:28:43.600 --> 03:28:52.660]  he was an emergency room physician, he never once made a report to VAERS for vaccine injury.
[03:28:52.660 --> 03:28:57.900]  After leaving the emergency room and learning about vaccine injuries, and I'm not sure how
[03:28:57.900 --> 03:29:04.120]  he learned about them, because doctors aren't taught what vaccine injury looks like. They're
[03:29:04.120 --> 03:29:08.180]  not taught to look for it, they're not taught to report it, they're not none of that. So
[03:29:08.180 --> 03:29:13.260]  I'm not sure if it was a personal experience or what it was, but after he left the emergency
[03:29:13.260 --> 03:29:17.640]  room and learned what vaccine injuries really looked like, in his article, he stated that
[03:29:17.640 --> 03:29:26.960]  looking back in hindsight, he could have made at least one or two reports per week to VAERS.
[03:29:26.960 --> 03:29:30.860]  That's incredible. I mean, you can't even begin to add up. And that's only one person,
[03:29:30.860 --> 03:29:34.420]  one person working in one particular room, and there are hundreds, thousands of those
[03:29:34.420 --> 03:29:40.540]  nationwide. Okay, we hear the music. We're coming up to another break for a few minutes.
[03:29:40.540 --> 03:29:45.660]  When we get back, we'll get back into the Wakefield and into the good news. And this
[03:29:45.660 --> 03:29:51.060]  will bring us back into Marcie's current interest. This is infowars.com, the Alex Jones Show.
[03:29:51.060 --> 03:30:02.540]  We're on the march. The empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN radio network. Introducing

[03:31:02.100 --> 03:31:06.660]  We've lived in this neighborhood for years. We have an alarm system and all of our doors
[03:31:06.660 --> 03:31:11.060]  have deadbolts. They kicked in our door and were in and out of our house in about five
[03:31:11.060 --> 03:31:16.520]  minutes. The police arrived in about 20 minutes, but they were long gone with our TV, jewelry
[03:31:16.520 --> 03:31:21.980]  and my guns. I kept thinking, what if my family had been home? The police officer said that
[03:31:21.980 --> 03:31:28.220]  more than 85% of break-ins are through a door and that deadbolts alone don't stop intruders.
[03:31:28.220 --> 03:31:32.580]  The officer told me to go to easyarmor.net if we wanted something that would actually
[03:31:32.580 --> 03:31:38.700]  stop an intruder. Easy Armor reinforces all of the weak points on your doors and is guaranteed

[03:33:14.580 --> 03:33:29.940]  I hurt myself today, to see if I still feel, I focus on the pain.
[03:33:29.940 --> 03:33:35.060]  See if I can still feel, that certainly goes to all those kids who are suffering from autism
[03:33:35.060 --> 03:33:39.980]  and similar neurological disorders as a result of vaccine damage. Once again, you're listening
[03:33:39.980 --> 03:33:45.260]  to the Overdrive Hour of the Alex Jones Show. I'm Sean Siegel. I'm the host of the Vaccine
[03:33:45.260 --> 03:33:50.660]  Myth and Issue of Trust. I'm here with Marcella Piper Terry. Marcy is the founder and director
[03:33:50.660 --> 03:33:58.260]  of VaxTruth.org. I'll sum up the vares with one sentence. Correlation does not equal causation,
[03:33:58.260 --> 03:34:04.500]  but correlation does imply causation. But we have, Marcy, one long and one short segment
[03:34:04.500 --> 03:34:08.820]  left here. So let's get into the positive side. In these last few weeks, the last month
[03:34:08.820 --> 03:34:13.940]  or so, on the vaccine myth and issue of trust, we've been trying to go into positive issues
[03:34:13.940 --> 03:34:20.860]  of trust, as opposed to all those others that are unfortunately so readily available to
[03:34:20.860 --> 03:34:26.420]  grab, which is the issues of trust where the CDC and all those other public authorities
[03:34:26.420 --> 03:34:32.340]  are misinforming us or disinforming us, or almost always suppressing, just simply not
[03:34:32.340 --> 03:34:37.620]  informing us and giving us the information that we as parents and grandparents demand
[03:34:37.620 --> 03:34:39.660]  from our public health authorities.
[03:34:39.660 --> 03:34:45.060]  But back to Dr. Wakefield. When Dr. Wakefield and the crew, he worked with 12 other people
[03:34:45.060 --> 03:34:51.100]  at the Royal Free Hospital in London. They diagnosed, they examined 12 kids, all of whom
[03:34:51.100 --> 03:34:57.420]  were autistic and had severe gastrointestinal problems. They found inflamed bowel disease.
[03:34:57.420 --> 03:35:06.520]  They actually found the measles virus inhabiting the guts of these kids. What's not told is
[03:35:06.520 --> 03:35:15.480]  that when they were treated for the inflammation, the symptoms of autism were ameliorated, and
[03:35:15.480 --> 03:35:18.460]  in some cases, almost miraculously.
[03:35:18.460 --> 03:35:25.500]  Kids who hadn't spoken for months or a year or more began speaking. And to me, the most
[03:35:25.500 --> 03:35:34.220]  heartening thing about it, and just amazing, is that from all accounts, these kids, if
[03:35:34.220 --> 03:35:38.220]  they were, say, four years old or five years old, and they had stopped speaking when they
[03:35:38.220 --> 03:35:44.380]  were three, when they began speaking, began using the words at the level of a four or
[03:35:44.380 --> 03:35:53.320]  five-year-old. The kids were growing internally. The kids were intellectually developing, while
[03:35:53.320 --> 03:35:56.340]  to the outside world, they had disappeared.
[03:35:56.340 --> 03:36:03.060]  And Marcy, you need to take the floor, ma'am, because you are now studying to be a biomedical
[03:36:03.060 --> 03:36:10.500]  consultant. And I'd like for you to tell the folks exactly all the good news about how
[03:36:10.500 --> 03:36:14.700]  autism and other neurological disorders can be treated.
[03:36:14.700 --> 03:36:22.540]  Okay. Well, I actually have been a biomedical consultant since 2007.
[03:36:22.540 --> 03:36:25.020]  I should correct you.
[03:36:25.020 --> 03:36:35.380]  That's okay. I've been a biomedical consultant since 2007. I applied to take the clinical
[03:36:35.380 --> 03:36:43.260]  training through Defeat Autism Now, which is an out branch of the Autism Research Institute
[03:36:43.260 --> 03:36:54.780]  in San Diego, which was started by the wonderful, amazing Bernie Rimland. And I applied to the
[03:36:54.780 --> 03:37:01.100]  to take the clinical training because I live in an area of the country where there was
[03:37:01.100 --> 03:37:07.140]  no access to Defeat Autism Now doctors or those who were practicing the biomedical approach
[03:37:07.140 --> 03:37:15.340]  to autism and the treatment of autism. And I was allowed to attend. I had to submit letters
[03:37:15.340 --> 03:37:17.780]  of recommendation and that kind of thing.
[03:37:17.780 --> 03:37:24.340]  So prior to that, I was already doing biomedical interventions before I ever knew that biomedical
[03:37:24.340 --> 03:37:30.860]  interventions existed or what they were called. I was researching and learning about orthomolecular
[03:37:30.860 --> 03:37:35.580]  medicine and orthomolecular psychiatry. And I was in a private practice, a psychiatry
[03:37:35.580 --> 03:37:43.660]  private practice, and was treating. It was pretty standard, not standard by any means.
[03:37:43.660 --> 03:37:49.760]  It was not standard by any means. Very comprehensive, very holistic practice, a wellness center.
[03:37:49.760 --> 03:37:56.460]  And we were treating patients. Of course, the psychiatrist does use psychotropic medications.
[03:37:56.460 --> 03:38:02.980]  But we also treated with fish oil and with probiotics and with digestive enzymes. And
[03:38:02.980 --> 03:38:09.520]  we did functional medicine labs and looked at nutritional deficiencies and gastrointestinal
[03:38:09.520 --> 03:38:16.220]  problems. We looked at food allergies. We ordered food allergy profiles for our patients.
[03:38:16.220 --> 03:38:20.740]  We did comprehensive digestive stool analyses, all of those things before I ever went to
[03:38:20.740 --> 03:38:26.040]  the DAN training. So I had a really good baseline in that and saw amazing results when those
[03:38:26.040 --> 03:38:28.340]  issues were addressed.
[03:38:28.340 --> 03:38:34.740]  After I attended the training, that's when I went out on my own and became a biomedical
[03:38:34.740 --> 03:38:41.060]  consultant and was working. What I would do is I would meet with parents and their children.
[03:38:41.060 --> 03:38:48.420]  I have a 20-page developmental history form that I ask people to fill out. And then would
[03:38:48.420 --> 03:38:52.700]  work with their family and physicians. I would make recommendations based on the family history,
[03:38:52.700 --> 03:38:59.260]  based on the child's individual medical history, based on the parent report of the child's
[03:38:59.260 --> 03:39:03.540]  development and taking all of those things.
[03:39:03.540 --> 03:39:08.820]  And most important, spending an average of about three hours with the parent, with the
[03:39:08.820 --> 03:39:16.500]  child listening and learning from what the parent had to say about their child. Because
[03:39:16.500 --> 03:39:23.060]  the parent is the expert about the child. No doctor who walks into an exam room with
[03:39:23.060 --> 03:39:29.980]  a patient, with a parent, with a child who has serious complex system-wide problems,
[03:39:29.980 --> 03:39:34.060]  no doctor is going to understand in three minutes or less what's going on with that
[03:39:34.060 --> 03:39:35.060]  kid.
[03:39:35.060 --> 03:39:36.060]  Right. The expert is the parent.
[03:39:36.060 --> 03:39:43.420]  Exactly. You have to listen. If you walk into an exam room and you think you know what's
[03:39:43.420 --> 03:39:49.500]  going on, then what's going to come of that? That's ridiculous.
[03:39:49.500 --> 03:39:55.460]  So at any rate, what I would do is I would work with families and with their physicians,
[03:39:55.460 --> 03:40:00.980]  which is not always easy because it's difficult to find physicians that are willing to listen,
[03:40:00.980 --> 03:40:05.580]  willing to think outside the box and willing to work with someone who is not a licensed
[03:40:05.580 --> 03:40:11.420]  physician. So that can be a challenge in itself. But it's not an insurmountable challenge
[03:40:11.420 --> 03:40:18.420]  and children get better. They get better and they get amazingly better. It's kind of
[03:40:18.420 --> 03:40:21.980]  like when you get a tune-up for your car. You can put gas in your car, but if there's
[03:40:21.980 --> 03:40:26.180]  no oil in it, it's not going to run right. If there's no fluid in it, it's not going
[03:40:26.180 --> 03:40:31.140]  to run right. You have to assess all of those things in order for it to run. And that's
[03:40:31.140 --> 03:40:35.860]  kind of a very simplified way of looking at what biomedical is.
[03:40:35.860 --> 03:40:44.020]  So it is very exciting. It's also very frustrating because the mainstream medical
[03:40:44.020 --> 03:40:50.740]  model is the norm. Children's needs are being ignored because they have an autism
[03:40:50.740 --> 03:41:03.340]  diagnosis. I think what's so heartbreaking for so many of us this week as we learned
[03:41:03.340 --> 03:41:10.340]  about what was going on with Alex at Loyola University Medical Center in Chicago, so many
[03:41:10.340 --> 03:41:16.900]  of us have been through biomedical interventions with our children. It's very costly in
[03:41:16.900 --> 03:41:20.900]  many cases. It doesn't necessarily have to be and there's a lot that parents can
[03:41:20.900 --> 03:41:29.060]  do without a physician. There are ways to get labs ordered and there are some really
[03:41:29.060 --> 03:41:37.820]  good labs that can help to decrease the stabbing in the dark kind of thing, the trial and error
[03:41:37.820 --> 03:41:41.900]  sort of stuff. There's some really good comprehensive labs.
[03:41:41.900 --> 03:41:48.220]  What's the best way for parents or grandparents or relatives who may be listening and are
[03:41:48.220 --> 03:41:52.780]  getting interested in the fact that there is a positive side to this, that such neurological
[03:41:52.780 --> 03:42:00.380]  damage can be treated successfully for them to locate biomedical consultation?
[03:42:00.380 --> 03:42:08.180]  Well that is becoming a problem actually. It's not as easy to find doctors who are
[03:42:08.180 --> 03:42:15.300]  willing to pursue this anymore because the more children are injured and the more parents
[03:42:15.300 --> 03:42:21.260]  are refusing vaccines and the more people are looking for doctors to help their children,
[03:42:21.260 --> 03:42:26.820]  the more the pharmaceutical industry is striking back. There are doctors throughout the United
[03:42:26.820 --> 03:42:32.140]  States who have been helping these children who have been targeted. I've not seen this
[03:42:32.140 --> 03:42:47.500]  but there are rumors and I think they're true that there is a hit list of doctors and
[03:42:47.500 --> 03:42:53.460]  they systematically are doing the same thing to these doctors that they did to Dr. Wakefield.
[03:42:53.460 --> 03:42:59.620]  The goal is to take away their medical license and to discredit them and to shut them down
[03:42:59.620 --> 03:43:06.220]  because it's about money. It's not about helping these kids. It's about money. It is very difficult.
[03:43:06.220 --> 03:43:15.780]  I'm actually in a pretty good position because I don't treat children and I just review their
[03:43:15.780 --> 03:43:20.020]  histories and based on their histories and their family histories and that kind of thing,
[03:43:20.020 --> 03:43:26.540]  I work with physicians who are willing to work with me. What we do is we don't treat
[03:43:26.540 --> 03:43:30.780]  autism because there is no medical treatment for autism. That would be against the standard
[03:43:30.780 --> 03:43:34.940]  medical model and you can't go against the standard medical model because that gets you
[03:43:34.940 --> 03:43:40.060]  in trouble. So what you do is you look at what the symptoms are and then you order the
[03:43:40.060 --> 03:43:47.140]  labs based on those symptoms and then when you get the labs back that confirm the presence
[03:43:47.140 --> 03:43:52.340]  of these medical issues, you treat the medical issues and when you treat the medical issues,
[03:43:52.340 --> 03:43:57.660]  the body heals and when the body heals, an amazing thing happens. Nutrients start being
[03:43:57.660 --> 03:44:01.500]  absorbed by the gastrointestinal system and when nutrients start being absorbed by the
[03:44:01.500 --> 03:44:06.320]  gastrointestinal system, then there are the building blocks in place for neurotransmitters
[03:44:06.320 --> 03:44:13.180]  to be formed because neurotransmitters are not formed in the brain. Believe it or not,
[03:44:13.180 --> 03:44:18.300]  neurotransmitters don't start in the brain. They start in the gut and if the gut is damaged,
[03:44:18.300 --> 03:44:22.340]  then the gut can't produce the building blocks for neurotransmitters so the brain doesn't
[03:44:22.340 --> 03:44:31.920]  work right. So autism is not a brain disease. Autism is a body illness. Autism is the behavioral
[03:44:31.920 --> 03:44:40.280]  manifestations of a body, systems-wide body illness. When you treat the body, you address
[03:44:40.280 --> 03:44:44.920]  the illness, then the brain starts working the way it's supposed to and the manifestations
[03:44:44.920 --> 03:44:51.580]  of autism, quote unquote, disappear. And that is such wonderful news and that's what should
[03:44:51.580 --> 03:44:56.820]  be broadcast and trumpeted internationally and is. It is through shows such as this,
[03:44:56.820 --> 03:45:01.940]  it's Alex's show and we certainly appreciate this opportunity from Alex to provide the
[03:45:01.940 --> 03:45:09.940]  message to everybody. And as with Dr. Wakefield, I have to mention too, it wasn't only the
[03:45:09.940 --> 03:45:15.940]  ability to speak, it came back to these kids who after being treated for their bowel inflammations
[03:45:15.940 --> 03:45:22.360]  began improving and their symptoms of autism began to disappear. They began to sleep at
[03:45:22.360 --> 03:45:28.240]  night when they hadn't slept for a long time. They began to recognize and bond with their
[03:45:28.240 --> 03:45:35.120]  parents and their siblings whom they had not recognized or bonded with for years in some
[03:45:35.120 --> 03:45:43.640]  cases where, I mean, you actually got the personal familial recognition and bond back.
[03:45:43.640 --> 03:45:50.000]  Absolutely. Just by dealing with their gut. Right. I want to tell you something about
[03:45:50.000 --> 03:46:00.600]  their, the first child that I treated, I'll try to make this short, but the first child
[03:46:00.600 --> 03:46:04.540]  that I treated who had an autism diagnosis was actually referred to me for neuropsychological
[03:46:04.540 --> 03:46:11.220]  evaluation which is something else I did, one of the other hats I wore. And her mother
[03:46:11.220 --> 03:46:17.600]  brought her to me because she was 13 years old. She was aggressive toward others in the
[03:46:17.600 --> 03:46:22.640]  school environment and the school was saying she can't come here anymore. She has to, she's
[03:46:22.640 --> 03:46:26.520]  going to have to go to an inpatient hospital setting where she can stay for the rest of
[03:46:26.520 --> 03:46:33.800]  her schooling. She's 13 years old. She had an moderate autism, moderate mental retardation
[03:46:33.800 --> 03:46:39.760]  at that time, that's what they called it, now it's moderate mental handicap, and with
[03:46:39.760 --> 03:46:48.160]  an IQ that was estimated to be in the 50s. She was non-verbal at that time. Her mother
[03:46:48.160 --> 03:46:53.040]  brought her to me because she wanted me to test her. The first three or four times that
[03:46:53.040 --> 03:46:56.800]  I met with them, the first time I had to jump back pretty quick because I almost got hit
[03:46:56.800 --> 03:47:03.880]  in the face with a fist. The second time, I didn't get that close, but she was absolutely
[03:47:03.880 --> 03:47:10.180]  not going to work with me. It was hands across the chest and no, we're not doing this. So
[03:47:10.180 --> 03:47:14.160]  after the third or fourth time, I just told the mom, I said, you know, I hate to keep
[03:47:14.160 --> 03:47:18.320]  taking your money because I don't know that I can help you. I mean, I can't test if she's
[03:47:18.320 --> 03:47:25.480]  not going to participate. That's why children with autism, quote unquote, get diagnosed
[03:47:25.480 --> 03:47:30.480]  as having mental handicaps because the tests that are being used are very heavily weighted
[03:47:30.480 --> 03:47:35.800]  for language and for attention and motivation. If they're not cooperating and they can't
[03:47:35.800 --> 03:47:40.080]  cooperate, they can't communicate with you, then they end up with these scores that make
[03:47:40.080 --> 03:47:45.760]  them look like they're mentally handicapped and they're not. Some of these kids are absolutely
[03:47:45.760 --> 03:47:52.200]  brilliant and a lot of them are. Well, what happened anyway was after the fourth time,
[03:47:52.200 --> 03:47:55.600]  mom says, you know, I'm going to keep bringing her because I think you can help her. So I
[03:47:55.600 --> 03:47:58.480]  said, well, let's go sit down and go over the, you know, we're missing something here.
[03:47:58.480 --> 03:48:03.240]  Let's go over the developmental history. So we started looking at it and I said, okay,
[03:48:03.240 --> 03:48:06.960]  tell me about the constipation. How bad is this? She said, well, it's pretty bad. We've
[03:48:06.960 --> 03:48:11.660]  been to the hospital four times for impactions. And I was like, oh my gosh, you know, okay.
[03:48:11.660 --> 03:48:16.320]  So sometimes she goes for up to a month without having a bowel movement. The doctor says,
[03:48:16.320 --> 03:48:22.000]  well, the pediatrician says, well, some kids that's normal. That is not normal. Having
[03:48:22.000 --> 03:48:26.440]  a bowel movement once a week or, you know, once every two weeks or even once every two
[03:48:26.440 --> 03:48:31.560]  or three days is not normal. That's not normal. That's the way the body clears itself of toxins.
[03:48:31.560 --> 03:48:36.880]  So that's your immune system working. That is the everyday workings of the immune system
[03:48:36.880 --> 03:48:43.980]  at play. It's clear toxins. And eventually we'll get into that too, that it turns out
[03:48:43.980 --> 03:48:52.860]  that one of the more egregious acts of the vaccine industry is to slander disease.
[03:48:52.860 --> 03:48:58.680]  Disease is simply the extension of the everyday working of the immune system when the toxicity,
[03:48:58.680 --> 03:49:05.760]  which needs to be removed from the body, has grown too great for the daily mechanization
[03:49:05.760 --> 03:49:13.440]  to accomplish. And at that point, the body takes advantage of whatever viruses or bacteria
[03:49:13.440 --> 03:49:18.600]  are available. It begins an infection. The infection gets rid of the toxicity, which
[03:49:18.600 --> 03:49:24.560]  as one of the doctors we've spoken to on the show says is a dirty word, basically, in medical
[03:49:24.560 --> 03:49:31.100]  language because you can't be specific with it. You can't give it a drug. You can't charge
[03:49:31.100 --> 03:49:36.000]  for it. But there it is. That's what happens. It's not a coincidence. It's not a coincidence
[03:49:36.000 --> 03:49:39.480]  that every time you've been sick in your life, you got well.
[03:49:39.480 --> 03:49:43.920]  The question is, and you think about it, and it's a fascinating question, did you get well
[03:49:43.920 --> 03:49:51.020]  in spite of the disease, or did you get well because of the disease? And that's where we
[03:49:51.020 --> 03:49:56.580]  ended up going with our issues of trust, was basically trust in mother nature. And what
[03:49:56.580 --> 03:50:01.500]  you are doing, Marcy, is fantastic. And all the other people like you who are working
[03:50:01.500 --> 03:50:06.040]  this around the country and around the world, because you're learning to support mother
[03:50:06.040 --> 03:50:11.860]  nature in her support of the immune system and allow it to do its job.
[03:50:11.860 --> 03:50:14.520]  If I can just finish really quick, Shawn, I want to tell you what happened with this
[03:50:14.520 --> 03:50:15.520]  girl.
[03:50:15.520 --> 03:50:16.520]  Do it.
[03:50:16.520 --> 03:50:24.220]  I sent mom home. I talked about the constipation. I sent her home with a protocol to clear out
[03:50:24.220 --> 03:50:31.740]  this kid's GI tract, to clear the constipation. And we scheduled a four-week follow-up. I
[03:50:31.740 --> 03:50:34.860]  told her, I said, I don't know if this is going to work. This is the first. I've done
[03:50:34.860 --> 03:50:38.260]  this with my kids, but this is what I want you to do. So I sent her home.
[03:50:38.260 --> 03:50:42.780]  Two weeks later, the physician I was working with says, oh, I heard from mom today, the
[03:50:42.780 --> 03:50:48.740]  girl who you were testing, the one that's not verbal, she's talking. And two weeks later,
[03:50:48.740 --> 03:50:52.220]  she came back. She met me at the bottom of the elevator as I was going out to take my
[03:50:52.220 --> 03:50:56.540]  little dog for a break. She met me at the elevator. She's standing there with her hands
[03:50:56.540 --> 03:50:59.620]  on her hips, and she looks at me. She says, I'm ready to cooperate.
[03:50:59.620 --> 03:51:02.100]  All right, hang on a second. There's a break coming up.
[03:51:02.100 --> 03:51:08.260]  Hello, I'm Alex Jones. Myself, my family, the Infowars.com team want to relay to you

[03:54:00.900 --> 03:54:19.260]  Okay, we're in the last segment. This is a short segment. Marcy, we've just got a few
[03:54:19.260 --> 03:54:25.780]  minutes. We'll be wrapping up here in our overdrive hour on the Alex Jones show. Again,
[03:54:25.780 --> 03:54:30.880]  Alex's sites are infowars.com, prisonplanet.com. And of course, you can watch his shows live
[03:54:30.880 --> 03:54:39.440]  at prisonplanet.tv. Basically, I just want to say that there's no reason to fear disease.
[03:54:39.440 --> 03:54:46.180]  For those of you out there who are still vaccinating perhaps, there's no reason to. The industry
[03:54:46.180 --> 03:54:54.860]  works on fear. They have morphed what used to be by the middle of the 20th century considered
[03:54:54.860 --> 03:54:58.360]  just rites of passage, medical rites of passage.
[03:54:58.360 --> 03:55:03.540]  Chicken pox, mumps, measles have been turned into the plague when they are simply for any
[03:55:03.540 --> 03:55:07.980]  child that has a modicum of health, of general health and immune system health, they are
[03:55:07.980 --> 03:55:12.300]  no problem recovering from those diseases. And they are rites of passage. The immune
[03:55:12.300 --> 03:55:16.900]  system actually strengthens through use like any system.
[03:55:16.900 --> 03:55:24.460]  Exactly. What we have done as a society to our children through vaccination for things
[03:55:24.460 --> 03:55:33.540]  like measles and chicken pox is we are denying their immune systems the experience that the
[03:55:33.540 --> 03:55:39.340]  immune system needs in order to strengthen. Every time the immune system fights off an
[03:55:39.340 --> 03:55:44.420]  illness and fights off a disease, it becomes stronger and then it is more able to respond
[03:55:44.420 --> 03:55:53.040]  in the future to similar types of illnesses. This is why now we have epidemics of cancers
[03:55:53.040 --> 03:55:59.340]  in addition to the fact that we're injecting so many toxins and disease fragments and foreign
[03:55:59.340 --> 03:56:07.000]  DNA into our children's bodies that's triggering autoimmune disease, allergies, asthma, childhood
[03:56:07.000 --> 03:56:17.340]  cancers and it's criminal what we as a society and those who are in charge in a society have
[03:56:17.340 --> 03:56:18.540]  done to our children.
[03:56:18.540 --> 03:56:19.540]  Absolutely. It's cruel.
[03:56:19.540 --> 03:56:24.820]  It's iatrogenic illness. It is iatrogenic illness and it is caused by vaccines.
[03:56:24.820 --> 03:56:32.060]  Absolutely. It's cruel and unusual punishment. Do not fear disease and vaccination is not
[03:56:32.060 --> 03:56:33.060]  immunization.
[03:56:33.060 --> 03:56:34.060]  No.
[03:56:34.060 --> 03:56:41.020]  Very basic. Vaccination, if anything, is auto immunization because the immune system is
[03:56:41.020 --> 03:56:46.340]  indeed infectious disease. Immune system is located in the gut, respiratory tract, eyes,
[03:56:46.340 --> 03:56:52.940]  nose, throat, some on your skin. It's where mother nature over the eons has expected every
[03:56:52.940 --> 03:57:01.180]  human to be introduced to pathogens. You're going to be inhaled or ingested. They're not
[03:57:01.180 --> 03:57:05.700]  going to be put into the muscles of your arm and bypass the immune system.
[03:57:05.700 --> 03:57:10.560]  The immune reaction is not just antibodies. That's what they use to judge efficacy of
[03:57:10.560 --> 03:57:17.060]  vaccination is antibodies. There are millions of people who are immune, which means low
[03:57:17.060 --> 03:57:22.140]  susceptibility to specific infections, who are immune without any antibody production
[03:57:22.140 --> 03:57:28.700]  whatsoever. That after their exposure to the particular potentially infectious agent, their
[03:57:28.700 --> 03:57:33.100]  immune system reacted on the other level, on the cellular level, and that was enough
[03:57:33.100 --> 03:57:35.640]  to give them the immunity they needed.
[03:57:35.640 --> 03:57:43.740]  The antibody is not indicative necessarily at all of immunity. By bypassing the immune
[03:57:43.740 --> 03:57:51.940]  system, it induces, it triggers a bastardized reaction. It is not a full immune reaction
[03:57:51.940 --> 03:57:59.340]  because it's not being inhaled or ingested or on your skin. You end up with chronic diseases
[03:57:59.340 --> 03:58:05.820]  such as Marcy was mentioning, chronic illnesses and autoimmune disorders, asthma, lupus in
[03:58:05.820 --> 03:58:12.980]  some cases. I mean, they are potentially catastrophic. Okay, Marcy, we're coming down to, we're coming
[03:58:12.980 --> 03:58:16.940]  down to the end. We've got 30 seconds.
[03:58:16.940 --> 03:58:22.580]  I was just going to say there's a really great video on the VaxTruth website called We Need
[03:58:22.580 --> 03:58:28.580]  to Talk. And that video goes through exactly what you were just talking about, Sean.
[03:58:28.580 --> 03:58:36.180]  Okay. VaxTruth.org and the vaccine myth and issue of trust. Okay. This is the Alex Jones
[03:58:36.180 --> 03:58:39.700]  Show. Sure appreciate the opportunity, Alex. Y'all take care.
[03:58:39.700 --> 03:58:42.540]  Thank you.
