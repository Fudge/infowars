[00:00.000 --> 00:14.140]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation it's Alex Jones coming to you live from the
[00:14.140 --> 00:23.600]  front lines of the Info War April 20th 2018 on this Friday global edition last
[00:23.600 --> 00:30.240]  Friday the 13th seven days ago we saw these strike on Syria and all that came
[00:30.240 --> 00:37.520]  from that and now a week later stories up on info wars.com it's on CNBC.com
[00:37.520 --> 00:41.720]  you can find it right there at dredgerport.com Democratic Party files
[00:41.720 --> 00:46.120]  lawsuit alleging Russia the Trump campaign and WikiLeaks conspired to
[00:46.120 --> 00:51.220]  disrupt the 2016 election because the entire Russia gate has completely
[00:51.220 --> 00:56.360]  collapsed completely they've moved on to Stormy Daniels and the raid on Michael
[00:56.360 --> 01:01.520]  Cohen Trump's lawyer and so now they've got to start another investigation that
[01:01.520 --> 01:06.600]  witch hunts out a couple more years and a lawsuit can do that harassing people
[01:06.600 --> 01:14.720]  all the different things that go the lawsuit the depositions you name it the
[01:14.720 --> 01:19.240]  multi-million dollar lawsuit filed in Manhattan federal court says that in the
[01:19.240 --> 01:23.200]  Trump campaign Russia found a willing and active partner in its effort to
[01:23.200 --> 01:27.280]  mount a brazen attack on American democracy this just got filed in the
[01:27.280 --> 01:31.800]  last 30 minutes Roger Stone's coming on with us in just a little while on this
[01:31.800 --> 01:37.960]  hour to break it down now we also have
[01:40.920 --> 01:46.200]  endless examples of the Clintons actually in bed with foreign governments
[01:46.200 --> 01:50.760]  including the Russians it is mind-boggling but this is the harassment
[01:50.760 --> 01:56.400]  that the deep state holding on to power by its fingernails is trying to use to
[01:56.400 --> 02:01.360]  intimidate everybody to roll over we saw last year the lawsuit filed against
[02:01.360 --> 02:05.680]  Roger Stone and President Trump by Obama's legal team that he created a new
[02:05.680 --> 02:11.120]  law office out of and then they admitted to quote shut down the Trump
[02:11.120 --> 02:15.760]  movement they were very honest about it so Trump's far from perfect but he's
[02:15.760 --> 02:18.960]  fighting to restore sovereignty to this country and doing a really good job and
[02:18.960 --> 02:22.800]  that's why the globalists are in full panic mode they are the criminal cabal
[02:22.800 --> 02:28.000]  and the Clinton crime network the Clinton crime syndicate as Owen shroyer said
[02:28.000 --> 02:32.360]  yesterday is going into high gear we are now going to see that they're full
[02:32.360 --> 02:37.440]  assault this is it it's not going to be free it's not going to be easy to stand
[02:37.440 --> 02:44.320]  against this this gorgon this hydra this psychotic demon with her long list of
[02:44.320 --> 02:48.960]  crimes and blood and war and torture and betrayal and just everything else that
[02:48.960 --> 02:55.480]  she leaves behind her in her ruinous twisted wake but I'm very honored to
[02:55.480 --> 02:59.000]  stand against this onslaught with you the info warriors you are the most
[02:59.000 --> 03:02.240]  hated grip on the planet by the tyrants and we've really changed history
[03:02.240 --> 03:04.560]  together
[03:05.200 --> 03:11.520]  Soros is in retreat all over the world the headquarters was foundation is now
[03:11.520 --> 03:16.200]  pulling out of Hungary and pulling out of other areas in Eastern Europe and
[03:16.200 --> 03:23.920]  moving to Vienna Austria so Soros is in retreat all of the world people are
[03:23.920 --> 03:28.240]  waking up to his criminal activities and all the weird talking heads they've got
[03:28.240 --> 03:31.840]  saying he isn't a Nazi or never helped the Nazis when he admitted himself on
[03:31.840 --> 03:36.800]  60 minutes it's just insane to the level of fake news they'll go to by the way
[03:36.800 --> 03:41.240]  speaking of that I could spend an hour on this because it's not about Gonzo
[03:41.240 --> 03:45.920]  journalism it's about covering what's happening and the attack on the first
[03:45.920 --> 03:48.280]  amendment but I don't know if I'll have time because there's so many important
[03:48.280 --> 03:52.880]  guests so many other big developments taking place but Megan Kelly didn't give
[03:52.880 --> 03:56.720]  me a chance to go on her program we sent her our comments we sent her a video
[03:56.720 --> 04:00.760]  response she'd invite me on her show neither did any other programs they
[04:00.760 --> 04:06.440]  would invite us so if we hit them back up they wouldn't respond back and she is
[04:06.440 --> 04:11.560]  recycled and I'm saying nobody died at Sandy Hook she's recycled all the pizza
[04:11.560 --> 04:20.320]  gate stuff that we have clarified and been very clear on and then says we
[04:20.320 --> 04:24.760]  won't stop talking about it we won't stop hurting these people it's Megan
[04:24.760 --> 04:28.800]  Kelly that called me over a year ago and said I promise this isn't about Sandy
[04:28.800 --> 04:32.920]  Hook or pizza gate and I said I am not getting into those subjects the media
[04:32.920 --> 04:36.760]  keep misrepresenting when I'm doing she said oh no this is about your custody
[04:36.760 --> 04:41.760]  battle well you heard me record it I've secretly recorded then she gets here and
[04:41.760 --> 04:46.360]  it's all about that and then she says I'm bringing it up hurting people and then
[04:46.360 --> 04:52.200]  misrepresents again and says that I say nobody died at Sandy Hook and that
[04:52.200 --> 04:55.240]  stuff's going on at comic ping pong when there isn't anything going on there
[04:55.240 --> 05:00.760]  she is the one defaming everybody and hurting these innocent people in full
[05:00.760 --> 05:04.560]  war's life is launching its newest product we're really really proud of it
[05:04.560 --> 05:11.160]  it's a best source prebiotic fiber and it's got the very best concentrated
[05:11.160 --> 05:16.600]  fibers from berries and fruits and other compounds that have been known to be

[06:05.680 --> 06:12.840]  discover trends and global developments years before they happen right here on
[06:12.840 --> 06:16.800]  the Alex Jones show
[06:16.800 --> 06:28.360]  as all of our hardcore listeners know from their own research this country is
[06:28.360 --> 06:32.680]  in the middle of a civil war against globalist forces that are openly trying
[06:32.680 --> 06:39.480]  to stop the populist Americana new renaissance that we are attempting to
[06:39.480 --> 06:45.360]  bring back into play free market true open societies versus globalism and
[06:45.360 --> 06:52.000]  corporate crony capitalist tyranny we have an overload of news and information
[06:52.000 --> 06:58.960]  obviously today we have democratic party throws a new giant temper tantrum
[06:58.960 --> 07:06.960]  because their Russia investigation has come up 100% high and dry they've now
[07:06.960 --> 07:13.000]  thrown a new giant temper tantrum to restart another fake investigation this
[07:13.000 --> 07:17.720]  time a civil one so they can continue to say there's an investigation oh we're
[07:17.720 --> 07:24.280]  deposing this person we're deposing that person and the lawsuit is gigantic
[07:24.280 --> 07:29.360]  making all sorts of claims of the criminal activities that went on with
[07:29.360 --> 07:36.160]  Trump WikiLeaks and the Russians with zero not one centilla of evidence
[07:36.160 --> 07:42.880]  amazing the Russians did not hack the DNC it was leaked out of the DNC we know
[07:42.880 --> 07:48.040]  from the files release that have digital coding on them that they were
[07:48.040 --> 07:55.800]  downloaded at six times the speed of the fastest internet connection two years
[07:55.800 --> 08:04.320]  ago you understand folks six times the fastest connection still four times the
[08:04.320 --> 08:09.520]  fastest connection today it was downloaded at point blank range just
[08:09.520 --> 08:17.200]  like Snowden did in Hawaii inside the big NSA Center it was downloaded at point
[08:17.200 --> 08:23.480]  blank range and now that's back on the news again today unbelievable
[08:23.480 --> 08:27.000]  disinformation but notice what did Trump say during the campaign said I don't
[08:27.000 --> 08:30.280]  know if the Russians or who else might be some fat guy in his you know mother's
[08:30.280 --> 08:34.000]  basement for all I know you can ping off anywhere in the world there's no
[08:34.000 --> 08:37.520]  evidence it's Russia but I see said but if it is the Russians release it it's
[08:37.520 --> 08:46.960]  about what's in the WikiLeaks not about changing the subject as they always do
[08:46.960 --> 08:53.000]  into who released it what about all the crimes and I heard Owen shroyer doing a
[08:53.000 --> 08:58.120]  great job yesterday during the broadcast when I took time off he was some family
[08:58.120 --> 09:01.760]  said that today on the war room he's gonna spend an hour it's maybe spend the
[09:01.760 --> 09:06.320]  whole three hours getting into the WikiLeaks and the top hundred WikiLeaks
[09:06.320 --> 09:09.720]  and you calling in and mentioning what WikiLeaks you think are most important
[09:09.720 --> 09:13.360]  just like they hammer all this fake Russia gate stuff constantly we should
[09:13.360 --> 09:21.920]  be hammering the Bonafides the bones the guts the reality of what is in those
[09:21.920 --> 09:26.800]  things and all the other leaks that they don't even deny are real sensational
[09:26.800 --> 09:33.200]  crimes sensational pay-to-play from the Russians and the Communist Chinese and
[09:33.200 --> 09:36.600]  all these big foundations billions of dollars going to Hillary hundreds of
[09:36.600 --> 09:41.080]  millions from the Russians yeah they could give my secretary of state to
[09:41.080 --> 09:44.880]  then give them a third of our uranium they did it absolutely do the Russians
[09:44.880 --> 09:48.480]  want to get our secrets and get our industry absolutely that's what we do
[09:48.480 --> 09:56.480]  to them the point is is that the traitors Hillary so you got the Democratic
[09:56.480 --> 10:01.520]  Party files monster temper tantrum because as I said last week and this
[10:01.520 --> 10:05.200]  week the wheels came off six months ago with a fake Russian investigation but
[10:05.200 --> 10:10.800]  now it's really come up dry it's moved on to the Arab Emirates and it's moved on
[10:10.800 --> 10:16.480]  to all these other places so we're gonna be getting into some of that as well but
[10:16.480 --> 10:21.280]  this this really shows how desperate they are you know Matt's a great
[10:21.280 --> 10:24.640]  producer in there and he's really hopping mad over this Megan Kelly thing and
[10:24.640 --> 10:27.880]  other stuff and he's just like you got to cover this today Alex you gotta talk
[10:27.880 --> 10:32.000]  one of the top stories in the country every channel is lying about you local
[10:32.000 --> 10:38.680]  radio TV everything you've got to cover it because it's bigger than you Alex and
[10:38.680 --> 10:42.880]  you know he's right he said this is a chilling effect this is so bad he's
[10:42.880 --> 10:49.200]  like shaking with anger I've never seen Matt angry like this there's like 20
[10:49.200 --> 10:55.320]  minutes of news clips attacking me I can't get to it it's just all lies folks
[10:55.320 --> 11:04.040]  but I'm gonna try to go to some of it but here's the bottom line the media
[11:04.040 --> 11:07.200]  brings up pizza gate and then misrepresents what I've said to beat me
[11:07.200 --> 11:11.280]  over the head and drag me to the mud and then say that need to be banned off the
[11:11.280 --> 11:19.760]  air they bring up Sandy Hook and say that I say nobody died when I never said
[11:19.760 --> 11:24.400]  that I played devil's advocate they took it out of context Megan Kelly plays
[11:24.400 --> 11:29.280]  clips that are about Hillary being responsible for thousands of dead
[11:29.280 --> 11:34.040]  children the Middle East she edits that and then plays it when she was at Fox
[11:34.040 --> 11:46.280]  News saying that I was saying Hillary was killing kids in a basement so the the
[11:46.280 --> 11:54.560]  the defamation is that they continue to bring up these cases never letting me
[11:54.560 --> 11:58.760]  drop it I don't think anything was going on at that pizza place we
[11:58.760 --> 12:02.680]  investigated it we walked it back we've clarified I'm done talking about it
[12:02.680 --> 12:09.040]  I just take it off the screen because it overshadows all the real stuff going on
[12:09.040 --> 12:15.520]  that I've got stacks of and mainstream news here and then you've got Sandy
[12:15.520 --> 12:19.080]  Hook where we talk about the police stand down we talk about the men in the
[12:19.080 --> 12:23.400]  woods with guns that were on the news on helicopter shots we said there's
[12:23.400 --> 12:28.000]  anomalies here and then some of the people thinking it was a total hoax
[12:28.000 --> 12:31.120]  began to think I was covering it up and I went wait a minute I'm not covering
[12:31.120 --> 12:34.480]  anything up and I'm done with this tar baby about a year into it that's four
[12:34.480 --> 12:39.600]  years ago and I constantly say mass shootings really happen but government
[12:39.600 --> 12:42.960]  stand down at Sandy Hook they stand down in Florida they try to take me off the
[12:42.960 --> 12:48.280]  air try to take me off YouTube saying I said nobody died in Florida you know I
[12:48.280 --> 12:55.360]  didn't do that and they're liars so then they get three of the parents of the
[12:55.360 --> 12:59.680]  poor little children that died when another Prozac head with a gun went and
[12:59.680 --> 13:04.200]  killed him and got the gun illegally and the media exacerbates it they bring it
[13:04.200 --> 13:08.240]  up and they say Alex Jones is attacking these families when it's the media
[13:08.240 --> 13:13.720]  dragging this out every week of every month for the last five years saying
[13:13.720 --> 13:18.400]  this the media never covered me in Sandy Hook at first but they saw when I said
[13:18.400 --> 13:22.960]  I think people died there because Paul Watson can totally convince me I was
[13:22.960 --> 13:26.720]  just asking questions and Paul got mad at me about this and I've been on record
[13:26.720 --> 13:31.520]  for four years about that I respect Paul and I respect and so my lot of my
[13:31.520 --> 13:36.560]  listeners got mad at me saying oh you're covering it up so they saw that as
[13:36.560 --> 13:42.200]  weakness in the media because I'm a real journalist and they know full well so I
[13:42.200 --> 13:46.560]  don't get equal time on Anderson Cooper or on Megan Kelly or any of these
[13:46.560 --> 13:52.400]  programs and they get these people up there with Anderson Cooper and they
[13:52.400 --> 13:58.320]  say that I'm bringing this out and I'm victimizing them Megan Kelly called me
[13:58.320 --> 14:02.200]  in April of last year early April she said I want to come to town well you
[14:02.200 --> 14:05.480]  heard it I secretly recorded it and I said listen I'm not getting into Sandy
[14:05.480 --> 14:10.040]  Hook or Pizza Gate she goes oh I'm not gonna get into that no no no it's all
[14:10.040 --> 14:13.000]  about you and your custody battle and how interesting you are you're such a man
[14:13.000 --> 14:16.240]  and I want to go out to dinner with you and man you're really you know all this
[14:16.240 --> 14:18.880]  other stuff because I didn't record the first part where she was saying how good
[14:18.880 --> 14:22.520]  looking I was and stuff in the car I was driving to work one Saturday I said let
[14:22.520 --> 14:25.720]  me call you back in five minutes because it was like oh you're just so manly
[14:25.720 --> 14:29.000]  you're so and I was like you heard some of it once I got here I recorded there
[14:29.000 --> 14:32.960]  you know what was going on I didn't have a recording app on my phone I have like
[14:32.960 --> 14:35.240]  the voicemail thing but doesn't record phone calls so I had to get another
[14:35.240 --> 14:40.640]  company phone and record it and I knew it was a total setup that I'm like oh
[14:40.640 --> 14:46.360]  really tell me about how sexy I am again sweetheart so you can read it Alex
[14:46.360 --> 14:51.400]  Jones Megan Kelly full interview leaked you can go read that listen to it see
[14:51.400 --> 14:57.600]  it so I'm saying I will not talk about Sandy Hook do you understand honey oh
[14:57.600 --> 15:04.920]  yes then she has the bold Cajones to go on her TV show yesterday morning with
[15:04.920 --> 15:09.600]  some of the parents and say isn't it horrible he keeps bringing it up isn't
[15:09.600 --> 15:14.240]  horrible he's sending crazy people to attack you I'm not covering it I'm not
[15:14.240 --> 15:18.960]  bringing it up I'm telling Megan Kelly I don't want to talk about it she's here
[15:18.960 --> 15:23.080]  a year ago in the eight hours she interviews me to edit it together and I
[15:23.080 --> 15:26.200]  keep saying I think Sandy Hook happened well why'd you say this why'd you say
[15:26.200 --> 15:29.680]  that I said well I questioned some of it what was going on early on because of
[15:29.680 --> 15:35.120]  anomalies and a stand-down edits that together to reissue it and put it out
[15:35.120 --> 15:41.160]  the woman is the consummate snake she is a in my view a corrupt evil lying
[15:41.160 --> 15:46.440]  lawyer master rating as a journalist who is a monster a front to the truth the
[15:46.440 --> 15:49.920]  ones are creating a chilling effect to shut down alternative information news

[20:05.480 --> 20:07.880]  show
[20:13.560 --> 20:20.160]  waging war on corruption it's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front
[20:20.160 --> 20:26.280]  lines of the info war so Donald Trump's been in office less than a year and a
[20:26.280 --> 20:31.640]  half and like Lazarus America has crawled out of its tomb economically
[20:31.640 --> 20:36.920]  culturally spiritually in many respects we've really turned the corner
[20:36.920 --> 20:43.880]  Lazarus has a heartbeat he looks like hell smells bad but he's on the mend and
[20:43.880 --> 20:50.120]  the banshees the vampires are going into connection fits of intimidation of
[20:50.120 --> 20:54.560]  bullying of just going wild and a lot of Americans are saying I'm gonna keep my
[20:54.560 --> 21:00.440]  head down and see who wins this you're not Americans if you do that America is
[21:00.440 --> 21:05.280]  America because we had guts we stood up the whole world every major historian
[21:05.280 --> 21:10.440]  said we were smart hard-working and Maynard and hell stubborn like a mule
[21:10.440 --> 21:15.280]  didn't back down that's what built it it's why on average we've got all this
[21:15.280 --> 21:21.040]  wealth is because we're not easy to push around well I see myself as a throw
[21:21.040 --> 21:26.680]  back then but America was the vanguard the cutting edge we're not going back to
[21:26.680 --> 21:32.000]  American values we are getting back to the future back to the real agenda that
[21:32.000 --> 21:36.480]  was making us so successful coming up Roger Stone is listed in the giant
[21:36.480 --> 21:40.160]  lawsuit from the Democratic Party now they already had Obama's law firm group
[21:40.160 --> 21:44.640]  that he founded one month before he left office to quote stop the Trump agenda
[21:44.640 --> 21:49.920]  remember that headline effect type that in it's from CNN Obama founds legal
[21:49.920 --> 21:55.840]  group to stop Trump agenda didn't say Russia to stop Trump they developed a
[21:55.840 --> 21:59.080]  little breadcrumbs to put out the new fake suit and the Democratic Party with
[21:59.080 --> 22:07.160]  all its money gets behind it to crush these individuals you talk about federal
[22:07.160 --> 22:10.400]  elections commission issue they shouldn't be able to do that should the
[22:10.400 --> 22:14.320]  Republicans be able to fund all these people so they can defend themselves oh
[22:14.320 --> 22:20.720]  no the Democrats will say no no no we can use our money to sue you the deep
[22:20.720 --> 22:27.360]  state but you can't use any government money to stop us Roger Stone's the next
[22:27.360 --> 22:30.080]  segment but let's get back briefly to Megan Kelly and I may just play a few
[22:30.080 --> 22:35.680]  minutes of this though it really is hard to watch CNN NBC all of them are in the
[22:35.680 --> 22:42.400]  tank they admit that and they're doing everything they can to try to shut down
[22:42.400 --> 22:46.360]  liberals conservatives you name it fact there's a big hubbub on the internet
[22:46.360 --> 22:51.960]  today that all of these mainline Democrats who are very very popular but
[22:51.960 --> 22:57.840]  have their own shows like Jimmy Doran others CNN is now pushing to have them
[22:57.840 --> 23:04.320]  blocked their monetization taken and to have that removed now CNN admits a month
[23:04.320 --> 23:08.920]  ago they've been lobbying to have us removed and then lying about what we've
[23:08.920 --> 23:14.680]  said to try to set the case for that so they defame us and they try to silence
[23:14.680 --> 23:18.920]  us so they can tell lies about us and no one can respond just like I got hundreds
[23:18.920 --> 23:22.920]  and hundreds of media requests saying what is your statement what is your
[23:22.920 --> 23:34.080]  response on Monday and I sent the media a video response and still for days after
[23:34.080 --> 23:38.520]  days they say oh Jones didn't respond Jones didn't respond Jones didn't respond
[23:38.520 --> 23:43.280]  make a clearly said oh he did respond on his YouTube lady I got on an airplane
[23:43.280 --> 23:47.520]  and come up there and got in studio with you and they you'll father one of the
[23:47.520 --> 23:52.320]  victims I just said sir I've been saying for years that I'm sure people died
[23:52.320 --> 23:55.720]  there and I never said for sure nobody died I said that I played devil's
[23:55.720 --> 23:58.480]  advocate and said I could see why some people don't believe the government
[23:58.480 --> 24:01.600]  because it's a lot about babies and incubators but it's been edited and then
[24:01.600 --> 24:07.600]  it's brought back up like I'm bringing it back up I'd say Megan you told me
[24:07.600 --> 24:11.400]  before you came here we weren't going to get into Sandy Hook but then you got
[24:11.400 --> 24:15.240]  into it and then you say I'm a horrible person bring it back up you're the
[24:15.240 --> 24:17.960]  horrible person
[24:19.600 --> 24:25.040]  ladies and gentlemen I am not going to be a statute in the law they want the
[24:25.040 --> 24:29.080]  Alex Jones statute to preemptively ban people and preemptively ban
[24:29.080 --> 24:35.880]  questioning public events they don't want you to question their narratives when
[24:35.880 --> 24:39.400]  they put out their narratives of chemical gas attacks and three times it turns
[24:39.400 --> 24:44.400]  out to be the rebels we're not sure of this time it's still up in the year but
[24:44.400 --> 24:48.760]  they have the motive and Senator Paul and all these other generals say that
[24:48.760 --> 24:52.000]  Assad doesn't have the motive and the rebels have been caught staging stuff
[24:52.000 --> 24:55.720]  before and they've been putting out fake videos of gas attacks and admitting
[24:55.720 --> 25:00.080]  it's fake I mean this is getting crazy and what does it say in internal Google
[25:00.080 --> 25:04.240]  documents from a year ago we want Jones shut down because he changed the
[25:04.240 --> 25:11.400]  narrative on Syria chemical attacks being staged they don't want me here so
[25:11.400 --> 25:16.000]  you don't have a voice so we can talk about this there's another article on
[25:16.000 --> 25:22.080]  info wars.com CNN associates info wars with pedo channel in bid to shut down
[25:22.080 --> 25:27.800]  its competition and hundreds of liberal channels that are popular but that are
[25:27.800 --> 25:33.880]  independent and anti-war they're being shut down they're being blocked and the
[25:33.880 --> 25:38.800]  left is so upset that people like Jimmy Dorr has left the young Turks he's more
[25:38.800 --> 25:45.920]  popular than them now and that they want him off the air that's what this is all
[25:45.920 --> 25:49.040]  about I've invited Jimmy Dorr on the show didn't matter we disagree on 80% of
[25:49.040 --> 25:52.400]  we agree and he points it out that they're shut down conservatives and
[25:52.400 --> 25:58.080]  liberals that are non-interventionist CNN and compares us to Nazis and pedophiles
[25:58.080 --> 26:02.760]  in the same newscast I've got a lawsuit I've got a real defamation suit because
[26:02.760 --> 26:06.400]  this stuff is causing damage with advertisers openly saying they're
[26:06.400 --> 26:12.040]  saying this so we lose advertisers you understand what we're saying here they
[26:12.040 --> 26:17.280]  say malice before thought didn't do harm they compare us to pedophile sites white
[26:17.280 --> 26:21.640]  supremacists who by the way have a right to operate on an agree with them they
[26:21.640 --> 26:27.320]  have a right to pedophile sites don't and didn't say we should be taken down
[26:27.320 --> 26:34.480]  that's all in a CNN report last night this group that force feeds itself to
[26:34.480 --> 26:38.240]  you at hotels and bars and restaurants and train stations and bus stations and
[26:38.240 --> 26:45.160]  airports that you just can't get away from it's like syphilis or gonorrhea or
[26:45.160 --> 26:52.400]  or herpes it won't go away it's just always there like a cold sore coming up
[26:52.400 --> 26:58.000]  CNN is raping this country raping the First Amendment it's all part of this
[26:58.000 --> 27:03.480]  big deep state constellation attack that's going on let's play some of this
[27:03.480 --> 27:09.520]  this is Megan Kelly father of slain Sandy Hook first grader Alex Jones must
[27:09.520 --> 27:15.240]  come clean on his life so they accused me of being a liar and calling them liars
[27:15.240 --> 27:20.320]  in the suit it was father and Travis County on Monday they say also that I
[27:20.320 --> 27:24.520]  must do a retraction I refused they sent the letter last Wednesday it had a
[27:24.520 --> 27:27.440]  month for me to do an apology or retraction but I can't apologize or
[27:27.440 --> 27:31.920]  retract something I didn't do then they instantly file it say that I'm not
[27:31.920 --> 27:40.040]  apologizing say that I'm saying nobody died and then saying why won't he go away
[27:40.040 --> 27:45.160]  why won't he stop saying and stop bullying us Alex but my audience knows
[27:45.160 --> 27:54.120]  what really happened this is worldwide news from Australia to Taiwan to England
[27:54.120 --> 28:03.240]  Sandy Hook father holds out Alex Jones on Megan Kelly it's amazing Megan Kelly
[28:03.240 --> 28:08.960]  had like a vampire has been on this story and bringing it up and misrepresenting
[28:08.960 --> 28:13.400]  what I've said to hurt me and she brings the pain up to the families again and I'm
[28:13.400 --> 28:16.680]  sure there's smart people these families you know they don't want this pain to
[28:16.680 --> 28:20.040]  their family and the memory brought up I'm not bringing it up except when
[28:20.040 --> 28:23.520]  they're in the news and the media is there saying I've said things I didn't
[28:23.520 --> 28:35.200]  say so I'm gonna ask the families to actually look at what I've said and to
[28:35.200 --> 28:39.080]  come on this show but you notice I'm not invited on any of these shows it's all
[28:39.080 --> 28:43.440]  got to be one-sided so that Megan Kelly can lie to everybody Roger Stones coming
[28:43.440 --> 28:47.400]  up I'm gonna probably put on the end of this some of the clips but it's just
[28:47.400 --> 28:50.480]  insane I probably should just shoot a whole special report on this Megan Kelly
[28:50.480 --> 28:54.040]  thing because they're the ones bringing it up they're the ones
[28:54.040 --> 28:57.920]  misrepresenting and then saying I am it's total and complete fraud from the

[33:20.920 --> 33:30.960]  Infowars.com is tomorrow's news. Today you're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[33:30.960 --> 33:40.040]  I'm picking up a transmission.
[33:40.040 --> 33:47.160]  But here's the good news Chunks. You think you're gonna assassinate Trump?
[33:47.160 --> 33:52.240]  And bully a bunch of us.
[33:52.240 --> 33:55.600]  How do I preserve that?
[33:55.600 --> 34:00.440]  One point at this point. And only the dumbest morons buying to your SJW
[34:00.440 --> 34:03.760]  globalist George Soros dropping. Stabilize it.
[34:03.760 --> 34:05.680]  Emergency reserve.
[34:05.680 --> 34:10.480]  The New World Order and Michael Moore. Go back to Haiti.
[34:10.480 --> 34:17.320]  We're awake and you're not putting us back in the coma. You got that Jack? You're done. It's over.
[34:17.320 --> 34:19.320]  Worldwide.
[34:19.320 --> 34:31.720]  Get him back. Get him back.
[34:31.720 --> 34:38.120]  It sounds like it's confirmed there are at least two shooters with fully automatic weapons.
[34:43.120 --> 34:48.400]  Well exclusively we've got Roger Stone joining us to give us a first look at
[34:48.400 --> 34:53.960]  this new Democrat temper tantrum that has been thrown. They have now filed
[34:53.960 --> 34:57.920]  because the whole Russiagate investigation by the special counsel
[34:57.920 --> 35:02.000]  Robert Mueller has come up completely dry except for exposing their own
[35:02.000 --> 35:06.480]  corruption, their own special unit inside the Justice Department and FBI with
[35:06.480 --> 35:12.480]  McCabe, Comey and others to try to frame the president for Russiagate to try to
[35:12.480 --> 35:17.400]  stop the duly elected president from taking the reins of power to try to block
[35:17.400 --> 35:23.280]  the electoral process of voting in this nation. They have filed a new mammoth
[35:23.280 --> 35:31.640]  lawsuit alleging the sky, the house, the kitchen sink and everything in it and
[35:31.640 --> 35:35.080]  Roger Stone is named and we have the blueprint. We predicted this a year ago.
[35:35.080 --> 35:42.080]  Politico Obama lawyers form worst-case scenario group to tackle Trump.
[35:42.080 --> 35:47.800]  There you go, ladies and gentlemen. And they just said to stop Trump period. And
[35:47.800 --> 35:53.240]  that's the group that sued Roger Stone the president a year ago to harass them
[35:53.240 --> 35:57.320]  and to cause them hundreds of thousands of dollars something Roger doesn't have
[35:57.320 --> 36:01.040]  and to dig into their lives and now they've got the Democrat Party launching
[36:01.040 --> 36:07.760]  it with Democrat Party money. So they sell the public that you know
[36:07.760 --> 36:13.920]  illegals aren't voting as the Democrats hand out in 14 states driver's license
[36:13.920 --> 36:17.120]  and then allow illegals to vote. They say Trump's a conspiracy theorist for
[36:17.120 --> 36:19.960]  thinking there's election fraud but they're saying the Russians stole the
[36:19.960 --> 36:23.600]  election with no proof and they're gonna use Democratic Party money to then
[36:23.600 --> 36:28.200]  persecute a whole list of private citizens. So can the Republican Party
[36:28.200 --> 36:32.480]  then not come in and fund the response to this? They better because this is the
[36:32.480 --> 36:36.800]  Democratic Party openly waging war against individuals and against free
[36:36.800 --> 36:41.760]  speech. They've got CNN comparing all Democrats that are anti-war to pedophiles
[36:41.760 --> 36:47.000]  and Nazis and then they put us in the same report. I don't have the money to sue
[36:47.000 --> 36:51.020]  CNN. CNN doesn't care if I fight them for two years and waste my time and win a
[36:51.020 --> 36:56.480]  judgment. They just want us out of the game folks. CNN associates M4 Wars with
[36:56.480 --> 37:02.680]  PEDO channel and bid to shut down its competition. This is next level ladies
[37:02.680 --> 37:06.000]  and gentlemen and the Democrats who are anti-war if you scroll down the Jimmy
[37:06.000 --> 37:14.000]  Dorr and others I'll read the tweet here points out that so CNN is so scared of
[37:14.000 --> 37:18.720]  YouTube news channels that they're creating a fake crisis so that YouTube
[37:18.720 --> 37:23.160]  will now fully demonetize independent news my show goes against the pro-Syrian
[37:23.160 --> 37:27.440]  war narrative being uniformly pushed by the establishment news so they smear
[37:27.440 --> 37:33.640]  me hard and they say sites like Jimmy Dorr you know runs right beside Alex Jones
[37:33.640 --> 37:40.760]  pedophiles and North Korea and white supremacists I mean if that isn't the
[37:40.760 --> 37:45.480]  most ridiculous like saying and their site ran next to CNN who that's even
[37:45.480 --> 37:49.760]  worse isn't it and then CNN calls for us to be removed and demonetized or in the
[37:49.760 --> 37:53.720]  reverse order so they are a clear and present danger to end the First
[37:53.720 --> 37:57.960]  Amendment to sue everyone to bully everything into oblivion to have illegal
[37:57.960 --> 38:01.840]  raids on the president's lawyer then one day later the judge leaks into the
[38:01.840 --> 38:07.800]  forewinds all this private stuff that isn't even an issue that they are mad
[38:07.800 --> 38:12.360]  dogs and so the question is what does the president do to counter this we're
[38:12.360 --> 38:16.600]  going to Roger Stone here in just a moment but first ladies and gentlemen
[38:16.600 --> 38:21.360]  first it is critical that everybody understand that we the people are awake
[38:21.360 --> 38:27.040]  we're involved we're focused and we can win if you take action one big way is
[38:27.040 --> 38:30.800]  supporting our local affiliates spreading the articles and the videos
[38:30.800 --> 38:34.840]  continually to not just your inner circle but to others that aren't aware of
[38:34.840 --> 38:38.160]  what's going on printing off articles leaving them at the dentist leaving them
[38:38.160 --> 38:44.160]  at the barber leaving them at the school getting my films watching them and
[38:44.160 --> 38:47.560]  then donating them to the local library or buying the books we sell and then
[38:47.560 --> 38:51.600]  donating them to local library every person you reach is critical because you
[38:51.600 --> 38:55.640]  reach the person with the truth once the lies don't work anymore once the
[38:55.640 --> 38:59.800]  blinders are off once they've taken the red pill and of course financial support
[38:59.800 --> 39:03.360]  they're trying to drain us they're trying to shut us down it is a full
[39:03.360 --> 39:10.360]  frontal assault everywhere with sad parents up there saying Alex Jones
[39:10.360 --> 39:15.120]  shouldn't bring up our cases anymore we're not Megan Kelly brought it up we
[39:15.120 --> 39:18.560]  responded when she lied about what we said about Sandy Hook we said we think
[39:18.560 --> 39:21.280]  people died there but when there's anomalies people have a right to
[39:21.280 --> 39:24.880]  question and so now we're being sued for saying quote we have a right to
[39:24.880 --> 39:29.920]  question actually played that on her program to say that nothing sacrosanct
[39:29.920 --> 39:34.000]  no because you're people like you were out there you vampire you are the
[39:34.000 --> 39:40.000]  vampire you you are you are a vampiric lying deceiver and you got caught for
[39:40.000 --> 39:43.000]  the whole world and your ratings are tanking further because you have no
[39:43.000 --> 39:48.960]  empathy no soul no nothing everyone sees through you Megan Kelly now the big
[39:48.960 --> 39:53.480]  thing we have the purest cleanest deep earth source from seven to twelve thousand

[40:09.680 --> 40:15.240]  runs we're gonna have it anymore so it's still 25% off because they got us a
[40:15.240 --> 40:18.760]  rush shipment that's being manufactured it'll be in in a couple weeks when
[40:18.760 --> 40:21.960]  that's gone it could be up to a month after that no more next to but I'm gonna
[40:21.960 --> 40:29.400]  keep it 25% off for just a week or so more as long as I can take advantage of

[41:14.200 --> 41:17.200]  when it's telling the truth has been listed in the latest lawsuit with a
[41:17.200 --> 41:21.160]  bunch of other people including the Russian government and President Trump
[41:21.160 --> 41:28.080]  Roger Stone what is this really all about well Alex there's nothing quite
[41:28.080 --> 41:32.000]  like waking up for a hearty breakfast you know the kind Winston Churchill used
[41:32.000 --> 41:37.360]  to enjoy and then learning you have been sued by the Democratic National
[41:37.360 --> 41:42.760]  Committee the official apparatus of the Democratic Party and your co-defendants
[41:42.760 --> 41:51.880]  are the Russian state the general staff of the armed forces of Russia the GRU
[41:51.880 --> 41:58.080]  someone allegedly calling themselves Goose for 2.0 a bunch of Russian names I
[41:58.080 --> 42:01.440]  don't recognize somebody named Joseph Miff's son
[42:01.440 --> 42:07.560]  WikiLeaks Julian Assange Donald J. Trump for President Inc. Donald J. Trump

[42:22.560 --> 42:27.320]  Alex this is a last-wing conspiracy theory that they can't prove this any
[42:27.320 --> 42:31.640]  more in a court of law than they can in the court of public opinion sure no no
[42:31.640 --> 42:34.720]  I mean their whole Russia investigation just fell apart so they're just rebooting

[42:46.480 --> 42:50.560]  because I kind of feel left out here that I've not been added I guess they
[42:50.560 --> 42:53.760]  just don't think they'll buy the guy from Texas as a Russian agent we're
[42:53.760 --> 42:58.680]  playing German music must mean we're on the German payroll stay with us

[47:43.880 --> 47:47.360]  against russia and roger's gonna pick it all apart and destroy it right now but
[47:47.360 --> 47:52.720]  doesn't this really mean that the whole Mueller thing is falling apart
[47:52.720 --> 47:58.080]  completely they admit that they've moved on to sex campaigns and you know things
[47:58.080 --> 48:02.720]  with the Trump's lawyer so they're trying to reboot it here to have another
[48:02.720 --> 48:07.800]  fake lawsuit which they then use as PR so that they're willing accomplices in
[48:07.800 --> 48:15.840]  the media compare it the deception Roger I mean the problem here is the alex is
[48:15.840 --> 48:21.000]  the same it has to be seen within the broader context of what's going on info
[48:21.000 --> 48:27.640]  wars being sued in a series of malicious baseless meritless but salacious suits
[48:27.640 --> 48:33.560]  designed to get negative headlines my being sued by a project democracy this
[48:33.560 --> 48:38.760]  lawsuit is essentially a knockoff it's a one-off of a lawsuit that's already been
[48:38.760 --> 48:42.960]  filed it is not a winnable case in the court of law because it's a left-wing
[48:42.960 --> 48:47.960]  conspiracy theory it strings together a series of events but provides no evidence
[48:47.960 --> 48:52.560]  of collusion there's no they're there they have no proof of collusion by the
[48:52.560 --> 48:57.880]  Russian state they cannot prove that the DNC was hacked ironically the reason the
[48:57.880 --> 49:03.320]  DNC can't be can't be penetrated on that question is the plaintiff's unwillingness
[49:03.320 --> 49:09.360]  to let the FBI or anyone else examine their servers how curious how flawed is
[49:09.360 --> 49:14.120]  this lawsuit but it's it's meant to to grind you down as you know they're
[49:14.120 --> 49:17.800]  trying to grind info wars down they're trying to grow around me in that stone
[49:17.800 --> 49:22.520]  cold soot crowd it costs you thousands of dollars just to fight these and have
[49:22.520 --> 49:28.440]  them dismissed or defeat them I was sued in Manhattan for defamation in a
[49:28.440 --> 49:33.520]  politically motivated suit I won before an overwhelmingly Democratic jury they
[49:33.520 --> 49:38.880]  didn't have a case there is no case here but alex listen to this star lineup of

[50:19.920 --> 50:27.920]  is most certainly Alex Jones let me ask you this question I know under campaign
[50:27.920 --> 50:31.840]  finance reform political activity like this is barred against people from the
[50:31.840 --> 50:36.600]  other party or other operatives clearly the Republican Party should come in and
[50:36.600 --> 50:41.160]  finance the counter to this if there's a new precedent for the Democratic Party
[50:41.160 --> 50:45.320]  when it's billions of dollars can start suing people Katie bar the door I mean
[50:45.320 --> 50:50.680]  this is so authoritarian Roger well the good news here is that when you go down
[50:50.680 --> 50:54.640]  through this list of plaintiffs the only one the only defendant pardon me with
[50:54.640 --> 50:58.240]  deep pockets who must defend is the Donald J. Trump for president
[50:58.240 --> 51:03.400]  incorporated the president's campaign which is more than solvent and they're
[51:03.400 --> 51:08.640]  going to have to be in court my guess is they're suing people unsuable in the
[51:08.640 --> 51:11.960]  United States and as they're suing the Russian state I don't think they'll be
[51:11.960 --> 51:17.560]  sending lawyers they're suing the general staff of the armed services of the of
[51:17.560 --> 51:22.320]  the of the Russian state I don't think he's going to be showing up it's a
[51:22.320 --> 51:27.720]  frivolous lawsuit it's meant for the PR listen to what we are charged with Alex
[51:27.720 --> 51:32.240]  since you're most likely in the John Doe list it's a giant stunt I mean that's
[51:32.240 --> 51:36.320]  all is just a giant stunt to put all their fantasies in there and act like
[51:36.320 --> 51:40.800]  it's real again like the lawsuit saying that I'm saying that nobody died at
[51:40.800 --> 51:44.240]  Sandy Hook in the last few years and that I'm bullying the families when I'm
[51:44.240 --> 51:48.080]  beg Megan Kelly not to bring it up in her interview with me and I have it on
[51:48.080 --> 51:51.720]  tape then she goes how dare Alex Jones bring up Sandy Hook in our interview
[51:51.720 --> 51:56.200]  there's nothing sacrosanct she actually says it he's so horrible that in my
[51:56.200 --> 51:59.640]  interview he brought it up she just kept bringing it up kept bringing it up she
[51:59.640 --> 52:05.840]  is an absolute fraud God she makes me sick go ahead sorry Alex you're kicking a
[52:05.840 --> 52:10.720]  corpse look at her ratings in the trajectory of her career after her trip
[52:10.720 --> 52:15.000]  to Texas look they tried every trick in the book they interviewed you late at
[52:15.000 --> 52:19.160]  night they turned up the heat in the rented house where it was shot to 100
[52:19.160 --> 52:23.440]  degrees to make sure you'd perspire they shot you from below to make you look
[52:23.440 --> 52:29.480]  satanic and guess what you still kicked her butt so you know I know how this
[52:29.480 --> 52:36.600]  one came out this is extraordinary and that we are charged with computer
[52:36.600 --> 52:42.120]  fraud and abuse Rico Rico conspiracy violation of the wiretap act stored
[52:42.120 --> 52:47.800]  communications misappropriation of trade secrets Washington DC uniform trade
[52:47.800 --> 52:52.520]  secrets act trespass I presume that's the alleged break into their servers
[52:52.520 --> 52:59.040]  conspiracy to commit trespass this is this is a hoax whoever whoever filed
[52:59.040 --> 53:03.440]  this should be held up for sanctions they have no case it's a left-wing
[53:03.440 --> 53:09.600]  conspiracy theory by a bunch of zany left-wing conspiracy theorists some
[53:09.600 --> 53:15.000]  lawyer at project democracy is probably having a relationship with someone at
[53:15.000 --> 53:20.680]  the Democratic National Committee so we we reproduce the same phony both yes
[53:20.680 --> 53:26.640]  meritless baseless lawsuit to get a great headline out of Roger Stone and
[53:26.640 --> 53:32.640]  Donald Trump Jr. and in our non-association with the Russians it's
[53:32.640 --> 53:37.020]  law fair the same thing you see every day at info wars with the latest Sandy
[53:37.020 --> 53:43.560]  Hook lawsuit with the with the the claim that you were grooming a an employee for
[53:43.560 --> 53:49.880]  gay sex I know you Alex that's not you so I mean it's all malicious it's just
[53:49.880 --> 53:55.840]  meant to get that negative headline just and this is a this is you know they
[53:55.840 --> 54:00.120]  just want to fight the point here is they don't seem to understand that rather
[54:00.120 --> 54:05.600]  than wearing us down rather than than encumbering us this just inspires me I
[54:05.600 --> 54:10.600]  love the taste of liberal blood you want to rumble let's rumble the lawyers who
[54:10.600 --> 54:14.880]  filed this I need them to spar and a minimum I need them sanctioned this is
[54:14.880 --> 54:20.520]  an abuse of the process your honor this is absurd they have no case they
[54:20.520 --> 54:25.720]  spring together facts that they find suspicious in their lefty worldview you
[54:25.720 --> 54:30.280]  lost the election there is rushing collusion a ton of it unfortunately it's
[54:30.280 --> 54:33.920]  with your girl Hillary is unfortunately they're the ones who paid a hundred and
[54:33.920 --> 54:38.800]  forty five million to Bill and Hill the Ruskies passing the rubles to them not
[54:38.800 --> 54:44.200]  us oh Bill got a half million for a speaking fee that's called a bribe can
[54:44.200 --> 54:51.120]  you say uranium one and who's in this tar baby well if it isn't mr. Mueller mr.
[54:51.120 --> 54:56.640]  Comey mr. McCabe and mr. Rosenstein himself the US Attorney who perpetrates
[54:56.640 --> 55:00.840]  the front of my next point notice this is on the heels of the Republicans
[55:00.840 --> 55:07.360]  calling for a criminal investigation of Comey Rosenstein Hillary McCabe
[55:07.360 --> 55:13.160]  absolutely it's time they got caught in a criminal conspiracy meeting with
[55:13.160 --> 55:17.120]  Russians to pay him for fake info that turned out to be fake to the and paying
[55:17.120 --> 55:20.640]  their wives to write it up it was even a payoff there and Hillary giving money
[55:20.640 --> 55:26.440]  to McCabe's wife a half million these are such arrogant sanctimonious criminal
[55:26.440 --> 55:31.280]  frauds and just like they filed this latest law fair piece of fiction you
[55:31.280 --> 55:34.280]  know they're gonna have it turned into a Netflix movie before you can you know
[55:34.280 --> 55:39.360]  click your heels well once or your ruby slippers we're gonna be off to fantasy
[55:39.360 --> 55:43.760]  land off the land of Oz here and there's gonna be a whole Netflix show based
[55:43.760 --> 55:49.320]  on this screenplay this I've this is a screenplay this I bet a Hollywood
[55:49.320 --> 55:54.200]  person wrote this this is a what hundred page however many pages sixty
[55:54.200 --> 55:59.880]  something page screenplay that they put out of total fantasy island land of the
[55:59.880 --> 56:05.160]  cuckoo's nest Roger well if that's true Alex they just want to stay right up
[56:05.160 --> 56:09.600]  front I want James Woods to play me in the in the production of of that
[56:09.600 --> 56:15.960]  screenplay absolutely this is a this is an abuse of the process but it it shows
[56:15.960 --> 56:20.600]  that what is what they are down to Mueller is out searching for crimes that
[56:20.600 --> 56:28.600]  have pardon me nothing to do with Russia and there is a you know they are every
[56:28.600 --> 56:34.360]  day they are more and more exposed so they have now to launch this this two
[56:34.360 --> 56:38.800]  part campaign and it has to be seen in context this lawsuit is just part of a
[56:38.800 --> 56:43.720]  larger scheme of lawsuits against me against Alex Jones against info wars
[56:43.720 --> 56:48.760]  against anybody who can who spreads the truth and then they use the phony lawsuit
[56:48.760 --> 56:53.200]  and its headlines as the very rationale for removing you for the internet in
[56:53.200 --> 56:57.320]  other words it's not proven it's the charge this is the new journalism no
[56:57.320 --> 57:02.800]  proof is necessary no evidence it just becomes Alex Jones said Roger Stone said
[57:02.800 --> 57:08.000]  it doesn't even need to be corroborated the evidence proof you know these
[57:08.000 --> 57:12.840]  things are out the window it's they point to the they defend you they steal
[57:12.840 --> 57:16.640]  your identity they put out hoaxes and frauds then they openly call for us to
[57:16.640 --> 57:19.800]  be removed because they can't face the truth but there's a large segment of
[57:19.800 --> 57:23.840]  America that understands it and is rallying behind us and our listeners
[57:23.840 --> 57:28.120]  our affiliates are not being bullied we are getting so many new affiliates we
[57:28.120 --> 57:33.640]  are expanding but these lawsuits cost hundreds of thousands of dollars to see

[59:45.880 --> 59:50.520]  you so much for being part of the 2nd American Revolution
[59:50.520 --> 1:00:17.680]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show you know Roger Stone I have to say is
[1:00:17.680 --> 1:00:22.000]  just as articulate as I am maybe more so he can certainly stay focused better
[1:00:22.000 --> 1:00:27.640]  than I can they'll at least let him a little bit on some of these shows I
[1:00:27.640 --> 1:00:31.240]  guess he's been around Washington 40-something years the rest of it he
[1:00:31.240 --> 1:00:36.480]  was during most the campaign banned off Fox CNN MSNBC CNN led the banning
[1:00:36.480 --> 1:00:39.920]  campaign they were very proud of that they're calling for my banning as well
[1:00:39.920 --> 1:00:45.280]  they called for his banning on Twitter which has happened but imagine I'm being
[1:00:45.280 --> 1:00:48.960]  accused of being a Russian agent with no proof I'm being sued and they're saying
[1:00:48.960 --> 1:00:53.800]  as I said nobody died at Sandy Hook and that I've that I've brought Sandy Hook
[1:00:53.800 --> 1:00:59.000]  back up when it's Megan Kelly she says how dare Alex Jones bring this back up
[1:00:59.000 --> 1:01:05.000]  when she did it on record I mean I really I released recording of her saying
[1:01:05.000 --> 1:01:08.240]  we weren't gonna go there or that she might just barely mention it when the
[1:01:08.240 --> 1:01:12.520]  whole point was that and this is like Alex Jones did it again he brought it up
[1:01:12.520 --> 1:01:17.400]  on my show that I asked him to but she doesn't say that it's next level where
[1:01:17.400 --> 1:01:21.680]  we don't even really get to respond Roger gets little bits here and there but
[1:01:21.680 --> 1:01:25.000]  you know you've denied you're tied to Russia you've gone over the proof
[1:01:25.000 --> 1:01:28.560]  everybody knows that I think you just attack the narrative here that this is
[1:01:28.560 --> 1:01:33.400]  lawfare this is a stunt this is a publicity stunt yet again and then tied
[1:01:33.400 --> 1:01:36.440]  into all the attacks on the free press because America needs to understand how
[1:01:36.440 --> 1:01:41.240]  those two things go together Roger look Alex the only thing worse in politics than
[1:01:41.240 --> 1:01:46.400]  being talked about is not being talked about they attack info wars they attack
[1:01:46.400 --> 1:01:51.880]  me they attack many of our handful of comrades who are amazingly effective
[1:01:51.880 --> 1:01:56.640]  simply because we are effective they would not be launching the these kind of
[1:01:56.640 --> 1:02:01.480]  campaigns they spend hundreds of thousands of dollars on bots denigrating
[1:02:01.480 --> 1:02:08.720]  you info wars me regurgitating the goose for 2.0 lies the Julian Assange lies
[1:02:08.720 --> 1:02:15.520]  the WikiLeaks lies the Podesta email lies this lawsuit says yet again stone
[1:02:15.520 --> 1:02:21.200]  predicted with great accuracy the future releases of WikiLeaks yes it's called
[1:02:21.200 --> 1:02:26.440]  coincidence and working your sources but there they have no proof it's a it's a
[1:02:26.440 --> 1:02:33.280]  fantasy a fairytale a left-wing conspiracy theory and it is going to be
[1:02:33.280 --> 1:02:38.560]  used for fundraising purposes you see give to the DNC help us in our lawsuit
[1:02:38.560 --> 1:02:43.960]  against the bad guys this this outfit project democracy which is an Obama
[1:02:43.960 --> 1:02:48.560]  blessed front organization the alum of the Obama administration assuming me
[1:02:48.560 --> 1:02:54.160]  using all these expensive white shoe arrogant lefty lawyers all of whom are
[1:02:54.160 --> 1:03:00.960]  gonna get sanctioned before this is over and they are they are fundraising at it
[1:03:00.960 --> 1:03:06.480]  give us 25 50 a thousand 10 thousand to help beat the crap and by the way by the
[1:03:06.480 --> 1:03:11.520]  way you're not you're not just saying that Obama founded this they admit in
[1:03:11.520 --> 1:03:16.120]  February of last year Obama created it to stop the Trump agenda that's the
[1:03:16.120 --> 1:03:19.080]  headline and it's targeting everybody that's what listeners have to understand
[1:03:19.080 --> 1:03:22.720]  we're not kidding here if you don't buy the products if you don't support us if
[1:03:22.720 --> 1:03:27.120]  you don't buy the products in for store.com we will not weather this Roger
[1:03:27.120 --> 1:03:30.080]  has spent I know I don't know about getting allowed to say but it's a million
[1:03:30.080 --> 1:03:33.880]  bucks that's most the money had I guess I did just say it you know with all these
[1:03:33.880 --> 1:03:38.520]  fake suits and he's winning them but Roger are you gonna do a slapback for
[1:03:38.520 --> 1:03:41.680]  the suit you won in New York when you got sued for defamation or does New York
[1:03:41.680 --> 1:03:45.520]  have a slapback I'm told I've got a countersuit I just countersued last
[1:03:45.520 --> 1:03:49.920]  week in DC you were there you know against Georgetown zero mainstream media
[1:03:49.920 --> 1:03:54.640]  coverage that I've countersued them rather than I want to fight tab most of
[1:03:54.640 --> 1:03:58.360]  these dismissed because I want to focus my attention on a lawsuit to reveal
[1:03:58.360 --> 1:04:02.120]  whether or not as I believe and I believe I can prove in a court of law I
[1:04:02.120 --> 1:04:07.440]  was subject of an unconstitutional politically motivated FISA warrant for
[1:04:07.440 --> 1:04:13.080]  surveillance along with Paul Manafort and Carter Page numerous mainstream media
[1:04:13.080 --> 1:04:16.480]  publications including the New York Times have asserted that that is the case
[1:04:16.480 --> 1:04:21.240]  the government refuses to admit it in the in their legal wrangling with
[1:04:21.240 --> 1:04:27.360]  Manafort and his attorneys and that is the lawsuit that I have to pursue they
[1:04:27.360 --> 1:04:31.800]  have no probable cause to have examined my personal communications other than
[1:04:31.800 --> 1:04:35.800]  the fact that I was for Donald Trump and an advisor of his and that is their
[1:04:35.800 --> 1:04:41.520]  interest the same reason at that juncture Manafort was also targeted so it is
[1:04:41.520 --> 1:04:46.400]  that's the lawsuit I want to focus on I'm going on offense here Alex what we
[1:04:46.400 --> 1:04:50.240]  will deal with all of these and we will seek sanctions and punishment for those
[1:04:50.240 --> 1:04:55.760]  who waste the court's time this kind of frivolous crap absolutely great job

[1:06:26.000 --> 1:06:32.800]  worldwide it's Alex Jones about the labors he was on with us last 30
[1:06:32.800 --> 1:06:37.720]  minutes he has been sued along with the Russian government President Trump and
[1:06:37.720 --> 1:06:44.520]  others for a wild raft of what he calls a hoax a conspiracy theory I am the
[1:06:44.520 --> 1:06:49.720]  beneficiary I say that sarcastically of similar lawfare lawsuits where they
[1:06:49.720 --> 1:06:56.280]  file these fictions and it's like a Hollywood screenplay with no evidence
[1:06:56.280 --> 1:07:00.200]  it's defamatory but it's filed into court so it has some protections not once
[1:07:00.200 --> 1:07:05.000]  the media picks it up because they've thrown a temper tantrum because they
[1:07:05.000 --> 1:07:07.840]  lost the election and the country's coming back and they're the globalist and
[1:07:07.840 --> 1:07:10.720]  they're the ones in bed with Russia Rogers getting hundreds of calls he's
[1:07:10.720 --> 1:07:14.760]  gonna be very busy person defending his first amendment his rights you name it
[1:07:14.760 --> 1:07:21.160]  the Democratic Party is now going after individuals talk about bullying this is
[1:07:21.160 --> 1:07:27.440]  unprecedented and it shows their desperation all this with the backdrop
[1:07:27.440 --> 1:07:35.080]  of Comey Mueller McCabe all caught in perjury to Congress Congress is now
[1:07:35.080 --> 1:07:38.680]  saying it's not just me months ago but I could I showed you the spot three
[1:07:38.680 --> 1:07:41.480]  changed testimony week-to-week month-to-month all those testimonies
[1:07:41.480 --> 1:07:45.400]  a Comey's caught he lied and said he wasn't leaking been caught leaking I
[1:07:45.400 --> 1:07:52.160]  mean they are in a lot of trouble if sessions hadn't been been I mean the
[1:07:52.160 --> 1:07:56.960]  word is that he was castrated by Nancy Pelosi in a woodshipping accident I mean
[1:07:56.960 --> 1:08:00.520]  I'm being sarcastic here but this has become downright treacherous and
[1:08:00.520 --> 1:08:04.800]  treasonous and it's becoming a dereliction of duty by the president
[1:08:04.800 --> 1:08:08.680]  this is just about you know political points I've studied history that I've never
[1:08:08.680 --> 1:08:14.440]  seen anyone in this country any party this mad dog classical authoritarian
[1:08:14.440 --> 1:08:18.680]  bullying persecution committing crimes and then pointing the finger at us who've
[1:08:18.680 --> 1:08:24.120]  done nothing no evidence of anything after giant investigations we're all been
[1:08:24.120 --> 1:08:28.160]  wiretapped I we got documents over a year ago that I've been wiretapped and I
[1:08:28.160 --> 1:08:31.760]  mean there's nothing there there's nothing going on but they don't care
[1:08:31.760 --> 1:08:35.780]  they just keep pressing and pressing so just briefly the backdrop of this
[1:08:35.780 --> 1:08:40.840]  Roger with Comey bizarrely running around falling on his face and just just
[1:08:40.840 --> 1:08:45.080]  all of the sanctimony is garbage by this group of criminals don't they get
[1:08:45.080 --> 1:08:49.480]  they're probably not gonna be able to set us up or get Trump the bullying
[1:08:49.480 --> 1:08:54.600]  isn't intimidating us and even if they were able to take us out and take Trump
[1:08:54.600 --> 1:08:58.560]  out the world's moved on nationalism populism's exploding globalism's in
[1:08:58.560 --> 1:09:01.860]  the tree Soros is in trouble now those of us that are on the front line we're
[1:09:01.860 --> 1:09:05.440]  taking the brunt of their counter assault so we need financial support
[1:09:05.440 --> 1:09:09.080]  prayers local affiliates need to be thanked if they're carrying this this is
[1:09:09.080 --> 1:09:12.840]  the second American Revolution so just any other key tidbits about the point
[1:09:12.840 --> 1:09:18.680]  in history we are right now let me just show you how wild the deep state and the
[1:09:18.680 --> 1:09:23.840]  left is in these lawsuit strategy John Brennan general James Clapper you remember
[1:09:23.840 --> 1:09:28.040]  him the guy who lied to Congress under oath about the metadata collection
[1:09:28.040 --> 1:09:34.640]  program on Americans Susan Rice the entire front line of the deep state
[1:09:34.640 --> 1:09:40.720]  filed a brief calling themselves a friend of the court in this exact same
[1:09:40.720 --> 1:09:45.480]  lawsuit where proud or where project democracy is suing Donald Trump and I
[1:09:45.480 --> 1:09:49.960]  why are these big shots of the deep state filing suits and their their their
[1:09:49.960 --> 1:09:54.920]  paper says the Russians often use political consultants as cutouts that's
[1:09:54.920 --> 1:09:58.640]  what it says it doesn't say that I am one it doesn't say they have evidence of
[1:09:58.640 --> 1:10:04.040]  one they just say it occurs like you know bears take a dump in the woods or
[1:10:04.040 --> 1:10:09.400]  the sky is blue it's like the cherry blossoms are beautiful in in April and
[1:10:09.400 --> 1:10:13.800]  May in DC it's like oh well since the cherry blossoms are out it means Roger
[1:10:13.800 --> 1:10:18.800]  Stone's guilty I know these lawsuits against me it'll say you know this
[1:10:18.800 --> 1:10:23.720]  particular host Owen shroyer said this and it's not even true and then this
[1:10:23.720 --> 1:10:28.080]  person that's why we're suing him and they say hit Daniels who's not even a
[1:10:28.080 --> 1:10:32.720]  lawsuit it's like a lot of it doesn't even match up it's like insane yeah no
[1:10:32.720 --> 1:10:37.280]  reading their lawsuit it's a it's a work of fiction spinning together a bunch of
[1:10:37.280 --> 1:10:40.360]  things that they read about the newspaper but they didn't like or that
[1:10:40.360 --> 1:10:47.480]  their fake news sites produced that is not factually correct they're very big
[1:10:47.480 --> 1:10:52.520]  on that it's interesting the way now Newsweek for example which is essentially
[1:10:52.520 --> 1:10:56.640]  the purchase of the trade name Newsweek not the Newsweek magazine or the company
[1:10:56.640 --> 1:11:01.080]  that was respectable you once know now is in the hand of crazy leftists who pump
[1:11:01.080 --> 1:11:06.160]  out for fake news day and night so be aware if you see Newsweek it's most
[1:11:06.160 --> 1:11:10.280]  likely bogus whatever they've repaid that's basically a retread of Buzz
[1:11:10.280 --> 1:11:14.160]  feeding all the rest of it Politico got so discredited they created Axios they're
[1:11:14.160 --> 1:11:18.480]  all having to create new organizations and new names because they're so
[1:11:18.480 --> 1:11:23.520]  discredited it's a it's a it's exactly right meanwhile you're absolutely right
[1:11:23.520 --> 1:11:29.280]  Alex this has cost me almost a million dollars stonedefensefund.com is where
[1:11:29.280 --> 1:11:34.240]  you send your contribution I already have to deal with house apparently with
[1:11:34.240 --> 1:11:38.760]  Senate and Senate Intelligence and Judiciary Committee requests and I'm
[1:11:38.760 --> 1:11:42.840]  gonna end up testifying there they have asked for an enormous dump of documents
[1:11:42.840 --> 1:11:46.520]  all of which are innocuous by the way and there's not nearly as much as they
[1:11:46.520 --> 1:11:52.600]  might think but I have those legal costs now I have the project democracy a suit
[1:11:52.600 --> 1:11:56.880]  where we've been ordered to give oral arguments in our motion to dismiss very
[1:11:56.880 --> 1:12:01.880]  rare and now this lawsuit that I have to defend so it's an attempt to bankrupt
[1:12:01.880 --> 1:12:06.120]  my family it's an attempt to to distract me when I should be at the
[1:12:06.120 --> 1:12:10.840]  reports fighting to protect this reformist outsider president I don't
[1:12:10.840 --> 1:12:14.440]  agree with him on Syria I don't like the idea that he signed the budget deal but
[1:12:14.440 --> 1:12:18.720]  he's a hell of a lot better than Hillary Clinton that I do know God bless
[1:12:18.720 --> 1:12:21.680]  you Roger it's gonna be working with you there he goes he'll be back on the
[1:12:21.680 --> 1:12:24.480]  war room today coming up three o'clock with one shroyer we're about to go to
[1:12:24.480 --> 1:12:29.120]  our amazing next guest Katie Hopkins who just love the work she's doing in the
[1:12:29.120 --> 1:12:35.480]  UK and here in the US and also on Fox News but before we go to her just briefly
[1:12:35.480 --> 1:12:39.560]  a lot of people ask me are you down I was at a restaurant last night and I had
[1:12:39.560 --> 1:12:42.600]  five different tables of people come over and say we love you Alex you know
[1:12:42.600 --> 1:12:44.760]  you're going through a lot keep it up we know their line about you and I said
[1:12:44.760 --> 1:12:50.480]  listen thanks for the support but don't feel sorry for me this is what it's like
[1:12:50.480 --> 1:12:54.640]  to fight for your country and these at least globalists are criminals and we're
[1:12:54.640 --> 1:13:01.080]  forcing them out in the open we're forcing them to come out and to really
[1:13:01.080 --> 1:13:04.560]  show people who they are and so yeah for those of us that are at the front
[1:13:04.560 --> 1:13:11.320]  lines there can be some problems but this is what we came here to do and so
[1:13:11.320 --> 1:13:16.920]  here's an example since Katie Hopkins is joining this is something she's covered
[1:13:16.920 --> 1:13:21.880]  a lot and we'll get into whatever topic she wants to cover rather damn counsel
[1:13:21.880 --> 1:13:27.000]  ordered to apologize to grooming whistleblower and there are members of
[1:13:27.000 --> 1:13:33.880]  parliament who were forced to resign because they talked about Muslim men
[1:13:33.880 --> 1:13:37.520]  running giant sex grooming and kidnapping rings thousands of girls as
[1:13:37.520 --> 1:13:44.000]  young as six seven years old many cases in towns thousands per town well I know
[1:13:44.000 --> 1:13:47.600]  Katie Hopkins has covered this and been demonized they have a nationally funded
[1:13:47.600 --> 1:13:53.280]  play about the assassination of Katie Hopkins this is the bullying but this
[1:13:53.280 --> 1:13:58.440]  newest article will cover later goes through how people tirelessly for 18
[1:13:58.440 --> 1:14:07.960]  years have been exposing this and being demonized being attacked you name it and
[1:14:07.960 --> 1:14:12.960]  then now they're being proven right this is the monstrousness of the left all
[1:14:12.960 --> 1:14:16.920]  over the world and their alliance with the worst forms of Islam it's truly
[1:14:16.920 --> 1:14:20.240]  insane there's so much to cover Katie you've always got a full plate of really
[1:14:20.240 --> 1:14:25.800]  interesting things what do you want to tackle first well just to pick up on
[1:14:25.800 --> 1:14:32.600]  your point there Alex about the grooming gangs I was actually reported to the
[1:14:32.600 --> 1:14:38.760]  police on the grounds of hate speech because I pointed out that 80% of
[1:14:38.760 --> 1:14:44.240]  grooming gangs are Pakistani Muslim origin and in that town that you just
[1:14:44.240 --> 1:14:49.560]  mentioned a place called Rotherham on Pakistani National Day they've hoisted
[1:14:49.560 --> 1:14:54.760]  the Pakistani flag in towns where thousands of young girls have been
[1:14:54.760 --> 1:14:59.800]  raped by Pakistani Muslim men and that's a sort of thing that's happening in the
[1:14:59.800 --> 1:15:05.440]  UK I spoke out against it I said it's inappropriate to be raising the Pakistani
[1:15:05.440 --> 1:15:11.120]  flag in towns where my kind of children white daughters like my own have been
[1:15:11.120 --> 1:15:15.600]  raped by these men and I was the one that was reported to the police and the
[1:15:15.600 --> 1:15:19.440]  police and crime commissioner investigated me because of my tweets on
[1:15:19.440 --> 1:15:24.520]  that subject but I think I want to talk about right now Alex is Alfie Evans you
[1:15:24.520 --> 1:15:29.600]  probably heard of him yes 20 months old little baby the Supreme Court have just
[1:15:29.600 --> 1:15:35.400]  ruled that he has no right to life they just overturned the wishes of the
[1:15:35.400 --> 1:15:40.880]  parents the two about an hour ago they decided that his life with a support
[1:15:40.880 --> 1:15:45.240]  machine will be turned off contrary to his parents wishes and this is the
[1:15:45.240 --> 1:15:50.480]  little baby who has a terminal illness but the pope waited in a hospital

[1:21:25.040 --> 1:21:28.440]  many psychopaths look just like that just because he looks like he's a nice
[1:21:28.440 --> 1:21:31.560]  guy give me a break that's so you don't want watching your kids I'm here to tell
[1:21:31.560 --> 1:21:36.360]  you he's a creep but Justice Department this is the breaking news Justice
[1:21:36.360 --> 1:21:40.760]  Department watchdog probes Comey memos over classified information they have
[1:21:40.760 --> 1:21:45.080]  opened a criminal probe at the Justice Department the Wall Street Journal tries
[1:21:45.080 --> 1:21:49.440]  to water it down but that's what this is is that it is a classified secret and
[1:21:49.440 --> 1:21:53.520]  confidential material and they have opened a criminal probe because that is a
[1:21:53.520 --> 1:21:57.720]  criminal statute there's your headline now we've got big breaking news with
[1:21:57.720 --> 1:22:04.680]  Katie Hopkins of Hopkins world comm on Twitter at Katie Hopkins and she joins
[1:22:04.680 --> 1:22:07.680]  us we'll get more into the grooming gangs that they're having to admit are
[1:22:07.680 --> 1:22:12.600]  going on that her and others valiantly exposed but as she pointed out Alfie
[1:22:12.600 --> 1:22:17.520]  Evans that we've followed for so long Trump's tried to invite her over here
[1:22:17.520 --> 1:22:23.120]  so much more Supreme Court rules against parents for second time so give us the
[1:22:23.120 --> 1:22:28.520]  latest breaking details on this sad story so his parents went back to the
[1:22:28.520 --> 1:22:33.360]  Supreme Court they're still fighting to try to save their son the Supreme Court
[1:22:33.360 --> 1:22:37.640]  just decided that that wouldn't be the case the Supreme Court has overruled the
[1:22:37.640 --> 1:22:43.640]  wishes of the parents they have declared that Alfie Evans's life is futile and I
[1:22:43.640 --> 1:22:47.320]  think there's a big distinction as a mother if someone told me medical
[1:22:47.320 --> 1:22:51.360]  treatment is futile I understand that but if someone tells me my child's life
[1:22:51.360 --> 1:22:55.560]  is futile that's a very different thing the father went to see the Pope to try
[1:22:55.560 --> 1:23:00.280]  and save his son but they are now going to turn off that child's life support
[1:23:00.280 --> 1:23:04.000]  against the wishes of the parents and I think that's my message to America is
[1:23:04.000 --> 1:23:09.440]  you do not want nationalized healthcare because ultimately the state has the
[1:23:09.440 --> 1:23:16.440]  final decision over the life of your child this has been going on for what
[1:23:16.440 --> 1:23:21.400]  well over a year and a half or so yeah it's been a long battle for these parents
[1:23:21.400 --> 1:23:25.840]  and before then there was another child Charlie guard same again the parents
[1:23:25.840 --> 1:23:29.400]  fought hard wanted to keep their child alive wanted to take their child
[1:23:29.400 --> 1:23:32.840]  actually eventually they said okay we'll just take our child home so he can
[1:23:32.840 --> 1:23:37.120]  die in his own cot because he never saw his own cot and the hospital wouldn't
[1:23:37.120 --> 1:23:42.760]  even allow the child to go home to die they demanded the child's life was taken
[1:23:42.760 --> 1:23:47.080]  in hospital and that seems to be the egregious bit here is this way of these
[1:23:47.080 --> 1:23:51.640]  hospitals treading roughshod over something that feels it needs a lot more
[1:23:51.640 --> 1:23:55.640]  humanity to it the fact they're just going to turn off this child's life
[1:23:55.640 --> 1:23:59.360]  support and there's been a very visciferous campaign outside the hospital
[1:23:59.360 --> 1:24:04.280]  his army you know they're called Alfie's army have been campaigning to try and
[1:24:04.280 --> 1:24:08.560]  save him so a really tragic day for the parents in a very difficult time to kind
[1:24:08.560 --> 1:24:14.200]  of rationalize the state having more say than the mother or the father will take
[1:24:14.200 --> 1:24:18.000]  Iceland they're about to be the only country in the world with zero down
[1:24:18.000 --> 1:24:22.000]  syndrome children and people say oh that's good well now they've got some EU
[1:24:22.000 --> 1:24:26.440]  countries saying we want to make it the law genetic testing and we will force
[1:24:26.440 --> 1:24:32.560]  you to terminate a down syndrome child and then people say oh well that's not
[1:24:32.560 --> 1:24:36.280]  eugenics it's classic eugenics and then next it's going to be other genetic
[1:24:36.280 --> 1:24:39.160]  disorders and then they're already listing people that are aggressive or
[1:24:39.160 --> 1:24:41.960]  people that are freedom oriented they're saying that's a mental illness and
[1:24:41.960 --> 1:24:47.200]  now we've got a designer those embryos what we are facing is a true Gatica or
[1:24:47.200 --> 1:24:52.240]  brave new world-type scenario here it's a really nasty thing and I think one of
[1:24:52.240 --> 1:24:56.200]  the things that really strikes home is the involvement of lawyers you know you
[1:24:56.200 --> 1:25:00.840]  and I would both agree we see way too much of legal action in our life because
[1:25:00.840 --> 1:25:04.400]  we're trying to be silenced I think it's a very sinister thing when you have
[1:25:04.400 --> 1:25:08.920]  legal action involving parents who are just fighting hard to try and keep their
[1:25:08.920 --> 1:25:12.960]  son alive because they love him so much I don't think this is a place for the
[1:25:12.960 --> 1:25:16.760]  courts and I don't think this is a place I don't think the state should ever have
[1:25:16.760 --> 1:25:21.680]  the final say on who dies and when they die that feels very sinister to me
[1:25:21.680 --> 1:25:26.840]  indeed have you seen national Dutch TV it was a few months ago where they sit
[1:25:26.840 --> 1:25:32.240]  there with a very well operating down syndrome gentlemen and they tell him
[1:25:32.240 --> 1:25:36.720]  how worthless he is and how he's bad for society how much money he cost and the
[1:25:36.720 --> 1:25:39.960]  poor guys this there and apologizes to him it actually made me get tears in my
[1:25:39.960 --> 1:25:44.960]  eyes it's disgusting activity and it's always leftist they're just they always
[1:25:44.960 --> 1:25:48.320]  call us Nazis but in their real activity they're the people that act and behave
[1:25:48.320 --> 1:25:53.160]  like Nazis it's absolutely bizarre and what's what's really crippling me about
[1:25:53.160 --> 1:25:57.680]  it what really drives me insane is the leftist labor they will never admit
[1:25:57.680 --> 1:26:02.560]  that actually our national health care system is broken because of uncontrolled
[1:26:02.560 --> 1:26:06.440]  immigration because we have half of Africa here you can get their treatment
[1:26:06.440 --> 1:26:11.280]  for free half of Afghanistan is in my country getting treatment for free if you
[1:26:11.280 --> 1:26:15.160]  fly over from Somalia yesterday and you arrive today and you're pregnant you
[1:26:15.160 --> 1:26:18.040]  can have your babies in the maternity ward I'm going to pay for that as a
[1:26:18.040 --> 1:26:23.040]  taxpayer but one of our own children this tiny baby when his parents want to
[1:26:23.040 --> 1:26:28.320]  keep him alive somehow he has to be disposed of you know if I had my way if
[1:26:28.320 --> 1:26:34.280]  I was in control of our health care system British people would be prioritized
[1:26:34.280 --> 1:26:38.760]  and national nationals would come first in the queue and be first in the line
[1:26:38.760 --> 1:26:41.960]  and I think that's a principle we need to have if we're going to have state
[1:26:41.960 --> 1:26:46.140]  medicine or nationalized health care Katie Hobbins you just hit on the
[1:26:46.140 --> 1:26:49.320]  clowered and pivot method that's just one university study where they admit
[1:26:49.320 --> 1:26:53.280]  from the 60s as you know that they want to bankrupt Western societies so they
[1:26:53.280 --> 1:26:57.000]  have a full communist takeover that's being directed by the large foundations
[1:26:57.000 --> 1:27:00.680]  who want total control they'll sit offshore and total opulence and tax-free
[1:27:00.680 --> 1:27:03.880]  you know with their trillions but we will live in a communist you know
[1:27:03.880 --> 1:27:10.800]  socialist STW nightmare of ignorance and poverty permanent poverty but if you
[1:27:10.800 --> 1:27:14.800]  look at what Macron called for on Monday with with the head EU official on
[1:27:14.800 --> 1:27:19.280]  migration they said oh we want 200 million North Africans the next 30 years
[1:27:19.280 --> 1:27:23.640]  and and we want it basically in Europe as we know it and it will bankrupt things
[1:27:23.640 --> 1:27:27.240]  we will have a civil war with Eastern Europe but it's the right thing to do
[1:27:27.240 --> 1:27:32.560]  it sounds like like a Kurt Vonnegut satire it sounds like a hallucination
[1:27:32.560 --> 1:27:37.600]  of a lunatic and there but exactly they won't give French or Brits health care
[1:27:37.600 --> 1:27:42.000]  Paul Watson's in great shape runs three miles a day but he got a really bad
[1:27:42.000 --> 1:27:46.680]  cold four years ago strep throat was coughing up blood for like three weeks
[1:27:46.680 --> 1:27:50.080]  he had to go beg them four or five times to let them go to the National Health
[1:27:50.080 --> 1:27:53.720]  Service and to get a waiver to go to a real doctor they have two tears you know
[1:27:53.720 --> 1:27:58.120]  he has money and they kept giving him a little pack of like Tylenol and and you
[1:27:58.120 --> 1:28:03.080]  a little pack of Band-Aids that's what you get oh here you have strep throat it
[1:28:03.080 --> 1:28:06.680]  could kill you here just go home but then if they're foreigners they just give
[1:28:06.680 --> 1:28:11.400]  them royal treatment it's it's sick they are absolutely prioritized here
[1:28:11.400 --> 1:28:15.000]  Macron is a very suspicious character the only good news coming out of France
[1:28:15.000 --> 1:28:20.920]  today that I quite like a Muslim lady who refused to shake the hand of the
[1:28:20.920 --> 1:28:27.240]  gentleman officiating on her nationalization into France she refused to
[1:28:27.240 --> 1:28:32.640]  shake his hand and she's now being rejected as a French citizen because she
[1:28:32.640 --> 1:28:37.920]  would not observe cultural norms in France so finally someone seen sense and
[1:28:37.920 --> 1:28:41.600]  said that listen if you won't shake our hands then you don't deserve to be French
[1:28:41.600 --> 1:28:45.960]  so I'm glad about that at least but I don't trust Macron one little bit I was
[1:28:45.960 --> 1:28:51.560]  there for his celebration of his win in the polls and he walked up to the stage
[1:28:51.560 --> 1:28:57.200]  to the European national that's right Katie Hopkins is on fire stay with us

[1:33:09.440 --> 1:33:16.880]  from the front lines of the information war it's alex jones
[1:33:18.800 --> 1:33:23.400]  Katie Hopkins is an English media personality she first came to notice
[1:33:23.400 --> 1:33:27.240]  2007 as a reality television contestant later became the columnist for
[1:33:27.240 --> 1:33:31.800]  British newspapers initially with a son and later the online mail that's that's
[1:33:31.800 --> 1:33:36.240]  their kind of spin on it. Her role as a presenter for the radio station LBC was
[1:33:36.240 --> 1:33:40.440]  terminated in May of 2017 following her comments on Twitter about the Manchester
[1:33:40.440 --> 1:33:44.000]  arena bombing. That's right don't criticize our precious little Islamists.
[1:33:44.000 --> 1:33:48.240]  She joined the Canadian and the rebel media in January 2018.
[1:33:48.240 --> 1:33:53.400]  Hopkinsworld.com at Twitter KT Hopkins you know I've been busy she's been
[1:33:53.400 --> 1:33:56.720]  busy but I want to talk to her but do some commentary for us as well and I know
[1:33:56.720 --> 1:33:59.560]  that there's been some other folks want to work with us we're just been not so
[1:33:59.560 --> 1:34:04.400]  much tied down with these fake lawsuits but they have been a distraction again
[1:34:04.400 --> 1:34:08.720]  the good news all our listeners is the lawsuit of the week as we now call it all
[1:34:08.720 --> 1:34:12.400]  of them are frivolous all of them are fake we've got nine of the sixteen
[1:34:12.400 --> 1:34:18.480]  thrown out in just the last few months but now you've got the whole thing with
[1:34:18.480 --> 1:34:23.640]  the Sandy Hook hoax not saying Sandy Hook didn't happen the hoax that I'm
[1:34:23.640 --> 1:34:28.320]  bringing it up the hoax that I'm saying the kids didn't die the little edited
[1:34:28.320 --> 1:34:31.760]  four or five second clips where I played devil's advocate years ago and said I
[1:34:31.760 --> 1:34:34.560]  can see how people don't believe any of this is real and they're all actors
[1:34:34.560 --> 1:34:37.520]  because the government lied about babies and incubators to get us to war and
[1:34:37.520 --> 1:34:41.520]  you see all the other fake news and wiki leaks blah blah blah but no I think
[1:34:41.520 --> 1:34:45.920]  people died there but they don't show that part just like Megan Kelly play
[1:34:45.920 --> 1:34:49.840]  clips of me saying Hillary is responsible for murdering thousands of
[1:34:49.840 --> 1:34:58.600]  children the Middle East she edited that to say that Hillary Clinton did it in a
[1:34:58.600 --> 1:35:05.400]  basement in DC that's how dangerous these people are folks and then they they
[1:35:05.400 --> 1:35:08.400]  hurt the families by bringing it up over and over again
[1:35:08.400 --> 1:35:11.520]  Megan Kelly coming to town saying the interviews for one thing it's for another
[1:35:11.520 --> 1:35:15.400]  thing then she turns it around and says I'm bad I want to get back into the open
[1:35:15.400 --> 1:35:19.040]  borders globalism what their plans are can Europe be saved with Katie Hopkins
[1:35:19.040 --> 1:35:23.280]  and that this is the 50th anniversary of a key speech that a gentleman gave that's
[1:35:23.280 --> 1:35:28.880]  been proven to be true Enoch Powell but just getting into media disinfo what
[1:35:28.880 --> 1:35:32.120]  they've done to you I've seen cases where they say you've said one thing but
[1:35:32.120 --> 1:35:35.560]  don't even show the clip and then call for you to be deplatformed this is their
[1:35:35.560 --> 1:35:41.320]  policy and now suing Roger Stone suing the president with no evidence of
[1:35:41.320 --> 1:35:46.280]  Russian collusion the left is so authoritarian they're always authoritarian
[1:35:46.280 --> 1:35:53.280]  when they get control where do you think this is all going I think you know what
[1:35:53.280 --> 1:35:59.560]  we have to be conscious of and always prepared for as conservatives fighting
[1:35:59.560 --> 1:36:06.120]  for the cause is that legal action is one of the tools and techniques used to
[1:36:06.120 --> 1:36:10.040]  silence us and that can be used in other ways as well I'm thinking about there was
[1:36:10.040 --> 1:36:16.520]  a Maltese journalist she's called Daphne Galicia and she was doing a brilliant job
[1:36:16.520 --> 1:36:23.000]  investigating mafia links and and she her relative said when she died she was
[1:36:23.000 --> 1:36:29.160]  blown up in a car bomb to silence her but she was inundated with legal action
[1:36:29.160 --> 1:36:33.640]  against her by a British firm and I can see that that happens to all of us if we
[1:36:33.640 --> 1:36:38.400]  start saying truths that they don't want to hear we suffer legal action police
[1:36:38.400 --> 1:36:43.360]  action I have people that report me to social services about my kids because
[1:36:43.360 --> 1:36:47.480]  they will try and silence you in any which way and what's important is trying
[1:36:47.480 --> 1:36:52.080]  to focus on delivering your message and remembering that what your job is is to
[1:36:52.080 --> 1:36:56.440]  deliver your message and tell your truths and try not to be distracted but I
[1:36:56.440 --> 1:37:00.360]  know that's hard and then we all need support at times to get through that I
[1:37:00.360 --> 1:37:06.680]  have my husband luckily and she exposed the Panama Papers which were the missing
[1:37:06.680 --> 1:37:10.800]  links on Hillary the Podestas and their whole network and so they blew her car
[1:37:10.800 --> 1:37:14.200]  up over it I mean whoever blew it up I've said Hillary and the Podestas would
[1:37:14.200 --> 1:37:18.040]  never do anything like that they're very nice good people you know when they're
[1:37:18.040 --> 1:37:22.960]  not at Alistair Crowley rituals publicly but where do you see them going as
[1:37:22.960 --> 1:37:27.000]  their temper tantrums get more and more insane as they try to cling to power but
[1:37:27.000 --> 1:37:31.640]  despite all that America starts to come back Hungary's coming back all these
[1:37:31.640 --> 1:37:36.160]  countries are rediscovering nationalism as humanity awakens I don't think they
[1:37:36.160 --> 1:37:39.160]  realize yet they can't put the genie back in the bottle intimidating you
[1:37:39.160 --> 1:37:42.840]  firing you the fact they fired you up British radio you've come to the US I'd
[1:37:42.840 --> 1:37:46.880]  say your profile just is what three or four times bigger than it was even a
[1:37:46.880 --> 1:37:52.160]  year ago I don't think it's working and no it's very frustrating for them that
[1:37:52.160 --> 1:37:56.240]  they fire me from my column late well they don't renew my contract they fire
[1:37:56.240 --> 1:38:01.720]  me from my radio show the biggest commercial radio show in the UK at the
[1:38:01.720 --> 1:38:07.480]  time on the weekend and yet I still seem to pop up but I am really annoying in
[1:38:07.480 --> 1:38:11.960]  that way it's like they're playing splatter rats or you know whack-a-mole and
[1:38:11.960 --> 1:38:16.160]  yet I keep popping back up somewhere else and that's I think you know it's
[1:38:16.160 --> 1:38:21.560]  something I always say to the liberals that they are Dr Frankenstein and I am
[1:38:21.560 --> 1:38:26.560]  their monster you know they created me they created you because the mainstream
[1:38:26.560 --> 1:38:31.280]  media is so useless because they tried to silence us actually what happens is
[1:38:31.280 --> 1:38:35.680]  our voices get louder and it goes to show that it doesn't matter what you take
[1:38:35.680 --> 1:38:40.160]  from us take our jobs take our money take off legal freedom lock me up it
[1:38:40.160 --> 1:38:44.240]  doesn't matter I'm still gonna go to Skid Row and show you what life is like in
[1:38:44.240 --> 1:38:48.360]  LA under the Democrats I'm still gonna go to South Africa and show you the
[1:38:48.360 --> 1:38:51.920]  genocide of the white farmers there because you're not going to stop me and
[1:38:51.920 --> 1:38:56.840]  this is the determination we all need is to take the knock back to try and not
[1:38:56.840 --> 1:39:01.320]  talk too much about them actually Clinton's a maniac let's not waste her
[1:39:01.320 --> 1:39:05.640]  time talking about her she's old news she's yesterday's story let's move
[1:39:05.640 --> 1:39:10.880]  forward talk about of the red wave coming talk about midterms and how we're
[1:39:10.880 --> 1:39:14.720]  going to get people out and how we're going to turn California red and how
[1:39:14.720 --> 1:39:17.800]  are we going to sort the border out and how we're going to show the National
[1:39:17.800 --> 1:39:21.640]  Guard at the border you know this is where our truths are let's not be
[1:39:21.640 --> 1:39:25.920]  distracted by little old ladies like Hillary Clinton who can't really walk
[1:39:25.920 --> 1:39:29.800]  down a set of stairs without breaking both legs and two arms well isn't that
[1:39:29.800 --> 1:39:34.160]  emblematic though of the deep state in the globalist that she still is like
[1:39:34.160 --> 1:39:38.640]  the deep state co-president along with Mueller and Comey and I know for a fact
[1:39:38.640 --> 1:39:42.880]  she's directing the lawsuits against me against Roger Stone and others that shows
[1:39:42.880 --> 1:39:48.440]  how crazy they are that they've got that evil crazy person who's clinging on the
[1:39:48.440 --> 1:39:52.080]  power despite brain tumors everything else I mean it just shows how it's
[1:39:52.080 --> 1:39:57.080]  hierarchical and how all the so-called conservatives I know behind the scenes
[1:39:57.080 --> 1:40:01.080]  are the cool funny neat people you get around liberals they're the most
[1:40:01.080 --> 1:40:05.080]  neurotic uptight they're like the old-fashioned conservatives that nobody
[1:40:05.080 --> 1:40:08.840]  liked I'm a libertarian and I remember you know kind of by the time I was born
[1:40:08.840 --> 1:40:12.280]  I'm 44 years old there wasn't a lot of the old stuffy conservatives left but I
[1:40:12.280 --> 1:40:15.240]  know what liberals were talking about that's when liberals were the avant
[1:40:15.240 --> 1:40:20.480]  garde the modern liberal is the most stuff shirt establishment weird neurotic
[1:40:20.480 --> 1:40:25.520]  OCD control freak the planet's ever seen there's no way they're gonna win Alex we
[1:40:25.520 --> 1:40:29.280]  don't do ourselves any favors by talking about them or by criticizing them
[1:40:29.280 --> 1:40:33.040]  actually or by stating the obvious we know that they're absolutely deluded
[1:40:33.040 --> 1:40:36.480]  maniacs we accept that we need to move forward from that what we need to start
[1:40:36.480 --> 1:40:40.640]  saying and doing is asking the questions they can't answer so tell me
[1:40:40.640 --> 1:40:45.800]  Democrats who's gonna run against Trump in 2020 tell me who you gonna put up and
[1:40:45.800 --> 1:40:49.000]  who's gonna win because I see no credible candidates now right now and
[1:40:49.000 --> 1:40:54.680]  Muslim population tell me if Islam is so fantastic why do you always seek
[1:40:54.680 --> 1:41:00.400]  refuge in Christian countries why not stay in countries that practice Islam and
[1:41:00.400 --> 1:41:05.320]  tell me if we want to have sanctuary cities why is it so many parts of
[1:41:05.320 --> 1:41:09.560]  California and saying no we don't want those sanctuary city laws we're not
[1:41:09.560 --> 1:41:14.000]  going to accept that we want federal law and we want type laws and we want
[1:41:14.000 --> 1:41:18.560]  immigrants out of our country ask them the hard questions and let's move this
[1:41:18.560 --> 1:41:22.880]  agenda forward no I totally agree with you're absolutely right I want to get
[1:41:22.880 --> 1:41:26.960]  into the whole me too movement and the bizarre woman that leads when we come
[1:41:26.960 --> 1:41:32.040]  back and few other key points but before that just briefly tell us about this
[1:41:32.040 --> 1:41:37.600]  Enoch Powell because I was unaware of this famous speech Sky News is covering
[1:41:37.600 --> 1:41:43.000]  it you were pointing it out and what he predicted 50 years ago to the day 50 years
[1:41:43.000 --> 1:41:46.840]  ago today Enoch Powell gave a speech conservative gentleman just before the
[1:41:46.840 --> 1:41:54.280]  race relations act of 1965 and he said he predicted that 20 years from then so in
[1:41:54.280 --> 1:41:59.080]  our in our history that the black man would have the whip hand over the white
[1:41:59.080 --> 1:42:03.720]  man it was seen as the most controversial speech ever made it was
[1:42:03.720 --> 1:42:08.040]  seen as promoting racial hatred back in the day but people went out on the
[1:42:08.040 --> 1:42:11.760]  streets they heard what they what he said and they were demanding the
[1:42:11.760 --> 1:42:17.280]  repatriation of migrants he said that the white man would essentially become
[1:42:17.280 --> 1:42:22.080]  enslaved to the black man and that they would take over and when I think about it
[1:42:22.080 --> 1:42:26.480]  you know the BBC there's outrage over the fact that the BBC have shown some of
[1:42:26.480 --> 1:42:30.280]  his speech there's outrage over what he said people call him a racist but of
[1:42:30.280 --> 1:42:34.240]  course then I reflect on South Africa where you can't get a job if you're a
[1:42:34.240 --> 1:42:39.080]  white man and you can no longer run a farm safety of your white man and that
[1:42:39.080 --> 1:42:42.920]  the killing of whites is seen as acceptable and I wonder just how crazy
[1:42:42.920 --> 1:42:47.480]  Enoch Powell really was or whether he was quite a wise guy well exactly and the
[1:42:47.480 --> 1:42:51.880]  left always use racial politics and the communists do and that's who runs most
[1:42:51.880 --> 1:42:55.120]  the world in these third-world areas so it's a recipe for destruction we'll be
[1:42:55.120 --> 1:43:02.480]  back it's been sold out for months and now it's back it's Michael ZX plus lower
[1:43:02.480 --> 1:43:06.760]  price more ingredients because we scaled up signed to your contract with

[1:43:25.480 --> 1:43:28.520]  have toxins in the environment pesticides herbicides but more importantly
[1:43:28.520 --> 1:43:33.600]  than bad bacteria the probiotics help this place yeast mold creates slime

[1:46:55.000 --> 1:47:05.720]  second American Revolution you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[1:47:05.720 --> 1:47:18.960]  the answer to 1984 is 1776 you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[1:47:18.960 --> 1:47:23.920]  Katie Hopkins journalist researcher firebrand for freedom is our guest for
[1:47:23.920 --> 1:47:27.800]  one more segment we've got another guest joining us in a ton of news I'm gonna be
[1:47:27.800 --> 1:47:31.520]  breaking the next hour but getting right back into this I've got so much to
[1:47:31.520 --> 1:47:34.560]  cover so many questions for her as you can talk on any subject but I I was
[1:47:34.560 --> 1:47:37.600]  asked her in the break I said what else is on your radar and she said Sweden's
[1:47:37.600 --> 1:47:41.840]  deadly problem with hand grenades which is really a Muslim problem and I was
[1:47:41.840 --> 1:47:46.440]  reading where rape there's up like 3,000 percent in the last decade 95% is
[1:47:46.440 --> 1:47:50.040]  Islamic but at the police say that they get fired this is crazy but I was
[1:47:50.040 --> 1:47:54.680]  reading the BBC article Sweden's deadly problem with hand grenades it goes on to
[1:47:54.680 --> 1:47:59.360]  say that Stockholm and its no-go zones are now expanding and they don't know
[1:47:59.360 --> 1:48:04.240]  why people leave hand grenades sitting on the path it's so that a swede picks it
[1:48:04.240 --> 1:48:07.560]  up and gets dies that's what it says but that they won't even put two of
[1:48:07.560 --> 1:48:13.800]  together these are IEDs these are booby traps like no one knows why people are
[1:48:13.800 --> 1:48:17.960]  leaving hand grenades laying around or where they got them maybe it just fell
[1:48:17.960 --> 1:48:23.000]  out of the sky the way that they'll bend over backwards but remember just Paul
[1:48:23.000 --> 1:48:28.800]  Watson a year ago they were saying Watson's lying there's no no go zones in
[1:48:28.800 --> 1:48:33.240]  Europe there's no go zones in Brussels Belgium so he offers a liberal to go
[1:48:33.240 --> 1:48:36.640]  there they go there and almost get killed basically now they suddenly admit the
[1:48:36.640 --> 1:48:41.880]  no-go zones and all the acid attacks and but that's only 20 million Muslims or
[1:48:41.880 --> 1:48:44.520]  whatever you know that will come in the last decade or so for 10 million the last
[1:48:44.520 --> 1:48:49.640]  five years imagine if they get their 200 million that Macron wants I mean like
[1:48:49.640 --> 1:48:54.680]  you said why are they leaving the wonderful world of Islam if Christianity's
[1:48:54.680 --> 1:48:59.800]  so bad and they need to convert us a Katie Hopkins why why are they why are
[1:48:59.800 --> 1:49:04.800]  they coming to the horrible dreaded evil Christian countries well I would say to
[1:49:04.800 --> 1:49:08.960]  Mr. Watson don't just sit in your bedroom challenging others to go there go
[1:49:08.960 --> 1:49:15.160]  there yourself my friend I went there because I'm a brave lady and I walked
[1:49:15.160 --> 1:49:20.760]  the no-go zone to bring Gabi and others I was told to add something off and go
[1:49:20.760 --> 1:49:24.960]  and suck my mom and but I didn't belong there I was a lady tried to stop me
[1:49:24.960 --> 1:49:28.360]  getting off the bus because she saw my hair and she was going no wrong place
[1:49:28.360 --> 1:49:32.680]  wrong place wrong person because you've never seen a white person in
[1:49:32.680 --> 1:49:37.040]  ring could be in some of these no-go zones but there there is a specific gang
[1:49:37.040 --> 1:49:43.160]  problem these hand grenades now sell for about $30 a piece they're just they are
[1:49:43.160 --> 1:49:46.760]  everywhere they ubiquitous as the tool of the trade and what's really
[1:49:46.760 --> 1:49:51.000]  interesting is the Swedish media are still trying to cover it up
[1:49:51.000 --> 1:49:56.400]  hand grenades are listed under flammable items so they don't count as an actual
[1:49:56.400 --> 1:50:00.440]  criminal offense and you know rape over there they try and downplay even though
[1:50:00.440 --> 1:50:04.040]  they're the rape capital of Europe so they're still not being honest but will
[1:50:04.040 --> 1:50:07.760]  be very interesting Alex to your point earlier about the rise of the
[1:50:07.760 --> 1:50:12.080]  conservative right is that in September they have elections it's fully
[1:50:12.080 --> 1:50:16.040]  expected that the Liberals and the Greens will be ousted and finally we will
[1:50:16.040 --> 1:50:21.000]  see the Swedes Democrats they're kind of UK it they will come into power in
[1:50:21.000 --> 1:50:24.720]  coalition with the conservatives and that will be a good thing but what's
[1:50:24.720 --> 1:50:29.220]  wrong with the left to want to commit cultural and economic suicide and not
[1:50:29.220 --> 1:50:32.200]  even try to convert people coming in but but you know as you know they run
[1:50:32.200 --> 1:50:36.280]  these ads in Germany saying where the jib of the children's show say worship
[1:50:36.280 --> 1:50:40.600]  Mohammed they tell 15-year-old girls go get a 25-year-old Muslim man he'll he'll
[1:50:40.600 --> 1:50:44.440]  give it to you right I mean this is on children's shows you cannot make this up
[1:50:44.440 --> 1:50:49.320]  not just here there it's everywhere it's like some weird cuckolding fantasy or
[1:50:49.320 --> 1:50:52.920]  something on the left to like tell 15-year-old girls go get you a Muslim
[1:50:52.920 --> 1:50:57.080]  man he'll he'll take care at night and this is on children's shows and then
[1:50:57.080 --> 1:51:00.600]  showing the man with the 15-year-old girl them sitting around you know and
[1:51:00.600 --> 1:51:04.560]  talking about how great their sex is for I mean the left has gone completely
[1:51:04.560 --> 1:51:08.160]  insane didn't they get they'd be thrown out of power doing this what's wrong with
[1:51:08.160 --> 1:51:13.120]  them they don't get it at all and yet it's happening time after time after time
[1:51:13.120 --> 1:51:17.560]  so in Germany for example we've seen the AFD alternative for Deutschland now
[1:51:17.560 --> 1:51:23.400]  second in power they are the opposition force we've just seen in Italy the
[1:51:23.400 --> 1:51:28.760]  Greens and the Liberals be replaced by the much stronger right-wing movement
[1:51:28.760 --> 1:51:33.600]  and the anti-migrant movement and we're going to see the same in Sweden and it
[1:51:33.600 --> 1:51:38.320]  delights somebody like me but what's very interesting in Sweden is that the
[1:51:38.320 --> 1:51:42.880]  issues of the Muslims are coming out of the suburbs and are now touching on
[1:51:42.880 --> 1:51:48.360]  middle-class areas the polite parts of Sweden and all of a sudden the Liberals
[1:51:48.360 --> 1:51:53.320]  are saying wait a minute maybe this migration thing isn't working as well
[1:51:53.320 --> 1:51:57.600]  as we thought so they are having to wake up to the problem because it's suddenly
[1:51:57.600 --> 1:52:01.880]  coming to their back door and I think that's fascinating they deny it while
[1:52:01.880 --> 1:52:05.800]  they can't see it in the poor suburbs now it's coming to the middle-class areas
[1:52:05.800 --> 1:52:09.680]  and you've got a 67 year old man dying on his bike because he picked up
[1:52:09.680 --> 1:52:13.160]  something he thought was a toy and it turns out to be a hand grenade they're
[1:52:13.160 --> 1:52:17.800]  starting to say oh maybe we have got a problem I look forward to the day when
[1:52:17.800 --> 1:52:24.720]  they say Trump was right about no-go Sweden 62 no-go zones now in Sweden well
[1:52:24.720 --> 1:52:27.160]  I agree with you that we should talk about what we're doing and what we're
[1:52:27.160 --> 1:52:29.960]  trying to build and how the economy is getting better everywhere we bring
[1:52:29.960 --> 1:52:36.000]  nationalism and free market back but you have the left attack you you you're
[1:52:36.000 --> 1:52:39.240]  willing to go into these really dangerous places Paul has gone in to that
[1:52:39.240 --> 1:52:43.920]  no-go zone before they had to leave they threatened to kill them but but but I
[1:52:43.920 --> 1:52:47.480]  agree I'd like to see Paul do more of that he does he does a great job maybe
[1:52:47.480 --> 1:52:50.880]  maybe we should have you know Paul and you sometime maybe I could fund a
[1:52:50.880 --> 1:52:54.480]  operation for you and Paul you could give him a tour around Europe and you can
[1:52:54.480 --> 1:52:58.240]  take Paul into those areas or maybe take me into those areas he doesn't need a
[1:52:58.240 --> 1:53:01.920]  mother figure but I think you should definitely target or challenge him to go
[1:53:01.920 --> 1:53:06.800]  to some of the more it's not a mother figure it's fun to have a bunch of you
[1:53:06.800 --> 1:53:10.800]  know saucy folks out together my challenge to mr. Watson would be to
[1:53:10.800 --> 1:53:13.680]  leave his bedroom for once and his camera and get out there and tell the
[1:53:13.680 --> 1:53:16.840]  truths of the people listen to people and tell their stories that's my
[1:53:16.840 --> 1:53:20.080]  challenge to info wars that's my challenge to Paul I look forward to him
[1:53:20.080 --> 1:53:24.040]  taking me up on it you know I have actually the only time I threatened to
[1:53:24.040 --> 1:53:27.480]  cut Paul's pay was about six years ago I said listen you're gonna get in front of
[1:53:27.480 --> 1:53:30.440]  a camera you're really smart you're gonna come on my show he's very reserved
[1:53:30.440 --> 1:53:33.760]  guy you know those northern England folks what what's the secret then to get a
[1:53:33.760 --> 1:53:37.280]  northern Englander like him so you can hang out with him for like half a day and
[1:53:37.280 --> 1:53:41.680]  he doesn't say two words when he's not on air what do you do what because Paul's
[1:53:41.680 --> 1:53:46.120]  a great guy what what do I do what's the British secret to get him out there
[1:53:46.120 --> 1:53:51.080]  maybe you have to attach electrodes to his underpants I'm not entirely sure but
[1:53:51.080 --> 1:53:55.240]  I'm not sure that that's legal either maybe you could say Katie Hopkins said
[1:53:55.240 --> 1:53:59.760]  get your little tush out of the door go and find some truths and go bring some
[1:53:59.760 --> 1:54:04.040]  real reporting to info wars to show some footage of places where you've been
[1:54:04.040 --> 1:54:09.040]  because people cannot argue with footage that you've taken from places that
[1:54:09.040 --> 1:54:12.480]  you've been that's the way we win they can call you a racist they can call you
[1:54:12.480 --> 1:54:17.280]  an Islamaphobe that you Paul needs an older experienced woman like you to
[1:54:17.280 --> 1:54:22.920]  show them around I think I would terrify the poor child I think we should do for that
[1:54:22.920 --> 1:54:26.920]  I'm being bad Katie seriously thank you so much for spending time with us I want
[1:54:26.920 --> 1:54:29.520]  to get you to town that whenever you want I'll fly you're here first class but

[1:54:48.240 --> 1:54:51.120]  four projects I don't like to give them away too early but certainly the
[1:54:51.120 --> 1:54:55.000]  Rohingya Muslim story is irritating me to death you know we hear all about the
[1:54:55.000 --> 1:54:57.680]  Rohingya Muslims but there's a very different side to that story the
[1:54:57.680 --> 1:55:02.240]  Muslims have invaded once more they've been persecuting the Burmese people I
[1:55:02.240 --> 1:55:05.280]  want to get in there and tell those truths and certainly I want to get into
[1:55:05.280 --> 1:55:09.480]  Syria as well and tell the truth that the Christians in Syria they need a sad
[1:55:09.480 --> 1:55:14.520]  to protect them the Christians in Syria will be wiped out if Al Qaeda get in and
[1:55:14.520 --> 1:55:19.240]  there is a really Christian resurgence going on in Syria so those are on my
[1:55:19.240 --> 1:55:23.840]  list of missions that I need to accomplish in 2018 Katie Hopkins thank you
[1:55:23.840 --> 1:55:28.560]  so much from Hopkins world thanks for joining us my pleasure that ladies really
[1:55:28.560 --> 1:55:32.240]  fun and smart and she's right we should be asking them questions like hey why do

[1:59:48.880 --> 2:00:15.680]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[2:00:15.680 --> 2:00:19.840]  we are back live broadcasting worldwide something mainstream corporate media has
[2:00:19.840 --> 2:00:27.720]  done is basically blacklist or ban any liberal or conservative that is anti
[2:00:27.720 --> 2:00:32.400]  war and by anti-war I don't want to start wars based on false flags and then
[2:00:32.400 --> 2:00:35.520]  be part of it's non-interventionist I've always been that way back when I was
[2:00:35.520 --> 2:00:39.240]  against wars under bush they called me a communist in the news now I'm a super
[2:00:39.240 --> 2:00:44.200]  right-wing racist it's all just labels and they constantly lie about me and
[2:00:44.200 --> 2:00:49.680]  demonize and then try to de-platform us off Twitter Facebook YouTube and CNN a
[2:00:49.680 --> 2:00:53.720]  couple months ago said we want all shuns off the air they said why is he on the
[2:00:53.720 --> 2:00:57.760]  air he says nobody died at Parkland but I didn't say that they just said that or
[2:00:57.760 --> 2:01:01.640]  they had little edited clips so they had to put my YouTube channel back up there's
[2:01:01.640 --> 2:01:06.280]  an article on info wars.com today CNN associates info wars with pedo channel
[2:01:06.280 --> 2:01:12.400]  and meant to shut down the competition and they have gone after Tim black is
[2:01:12.400 --> 2:01:16.560]  very very popular they've obviously gone after Jimmy Dorr because guess he was
[2:01:16.560 --> 2:01:19.920]  on the young Turks for now he's almost as popular as you know they are so they
[2:01:19.920 --> 2:01:24.640]  want him blocked because he's anti-war and that's what liberals are finding
[2:01:24.640 --> 2:01:29.240]  out is liberals that are real liberals you know that are pro-free speech and
[2:01:29.240 --> 2:01:34.000]  anti-war they're being kicked off the air just like we are and it's very
[2:01:34.000 --> 2:01:37.360]  dangerous and that's because the big corporations news core two months ago I
[2:01:37.360 --> 2:01:41.680]  read the article in the Wall Street Journal that their new CEO said we're
[2:01:41.680 --> 2:01:45.320]  going to start with Alex Jones and WikiLeaks and when conservatives accept
[2:01:45.320 --> 2:01:48.720]  him off when liberals accept WikiLeaks being taken off we're going to
[2:01:48.720 --> 2:01:51.400]  basically de-platform everybody we're gonna make hundreds of billions of
[2:01:51.400 --> 2:01:55.200]  dollars extra and then it just started and the left went hold on to your ten
[2:01:55.200 --> 2:01:58.560]  full hat Alex you're gonna be off the air soon they were the celebrating it so
[2:01:58.560 --> 2:02:01.560]  this is all a concerted effort we're about to go to break but I want to go to
[2:02:01.560 --> 2:02:06.480]  Tim black right now for now he's on a Twitter and Facebook at real Tim black
[2:02:06.480 --> 2:02:11.000]  Tim black TV.com he's got two popular shows I've got millions of listeners of
[2:02:11.000 --> 2:02:15.560]  a week and that's why he's being demonetized the platform because if
[2:02:15.560 --> 2:02:18.920]  you're real and not taking the script that matter of your liberal or
[2:02:18.920 --> 2:02:22.360]  conservative or what color you are they want you silence because you're not
[2:02:22.360 --> 2:02:25.320]  controlled and he's another one of the real liberals who isn't scared to come
[2:02:25.320 --> 2:02:29.320]  on the show I'm asking Dora to come on and he's probably scared he'll get
[2:02:29.320 --> 2:02:32.920]  criticized if he does everybody should be talking to everybody it's ridiculous
[2:02:32.920 --> 2:02:36.680]  so thank you for coming on Tim. Hey man thank you for having me Alex I
[2:02:36.680 --> 2:02:41.840]  appreciate it man on a school walkout day nonetheless so it's great man that's
[2:02:41.840 --> 2:02:45.960]  right in fact they've got the walkout going to take the guns or whatever you
[2:02:45.960 --> 2:02:48.000]  know you know the young people want to do that that's their issue but you know
[2:02:48.000 --> 2:02:52.920]  Soros is funding that yeah you know it's not that it's it's you know just that
[2:02:52.920 --> 2:02:57.120]  the young people are concerned you know regardless of Soros involvement you
[2:02:57.120 --> 2:03:00.760]  know they just see violence you know they see violence they see death and it
[2:03:00.760 --> 2:03:04.360]  just you know just scared their kids Alex so you know you know in the spirit
[2:03:04.360 --> 2:03:08.280]  of that I'm glad to be here with you and just you know recognizing that you know
[2:03:08.280 --> 2:03:12.160]  I do support these Dijon people brother. Absolutely I mean it's good to say that
[2:03:12.160 --> 2:03:15.480]  up front of the left will say crucify her for daring to come on my show but
[2:03:15.480 --> 2:03:19.280]  shouldn't we all agree that they're targeting anti-war people period? Oh
[2:03:19.280 --> 2:03:24.200]  yeah brother yes absolutely I mean you know that's why I appreciate what you
[2:03:24.200 --> 2:03:27.720]  said earlier before I came on where you expressed you expressed that you know
[2:03:27.720 --> 2:03:32.360]  anyone who's anti-war is put into a bucket right the bucket of do not touch
[2:03:32.360 --> 2:03:36.680]  the bucket of smear you know there's no anti-war movement on the left if it
[2:03:36.680 --> 2:03:41.000]  wasn't for people like Jimmy Dore myself Lee Camp it's in Nico house it's
[2:03:41.000 --> 2:03:45.720]  barely it's barely noticeable Alex and that's because people get demonetized
[2:03:45.720 --> 2:03:49.440]  it's all about the money. Oh yeah man absolutely man that war machine has to
[2:03:49.440 --> 2:03:54.480]  keep churning. I just can't believe that so many people in the whole spectrum
[2:03:54.480 --> 2:03:57.360]  roll over to these wars just because they get a little bit of money it's it's
[2:03:57.360 --> 2:04:01.720]  sick. Yeah you know I was the same way you know under Obama man when I when I
[2:04:01.720 --> 2:04:05.920]  woke up so to speak Alex man I realized that Obama he was starting more wars he
[2:04:05.920 --> 2:04:10.000]  wasn't ending wars I mean when he came in we were at war two places by the time
[2:04:10.000 --> 2:04:13.680]  he left we were at war seven places you know we talk about it on our comedy
[2:04:13.680 --> 2:04:18.800]  tour that you know he dropped more bombs like 226,000 bombs Obama dropped bombs
[2:04:18.800 --> 2:04:23.600]  so we ran out of bombs so I was against the war then I'm against it now it has
[2:04:23.600 --> 2:04:27.280]  nothing to do with Trump it has nothing to do with Obama I'm just against war as
[2:04:27.280 --> 2:04:31.920]  a principle brother. Well I agree with you I'm against offensive preemptive
[2:04:31.920 --> 2:04:36.240]  war when we are siding with the bad guys now somebody attacks us that's not war
[2:04:36.240 --> 2:04:39.440]  it's defense in my view but it's the person that starts it that's the war
[2:04:39.440 --> 2:04:43.360]  the people fighting back to the defense back in 60 seconds we're committing a
[2:04:43.360 --> 2:04:47.520]  big cardinal sin a liberal and a libertarian together actually be an
[2:04:47.520 --> 2:04:52.640]  anti-war this is the big no-no but this is America still right we'll be right

[2:06:14.760 --> 2:06:27.960]  The human her pee, Megan Kelly, has been out defaming me as usual. I'm not saying
[2:06:27.960 --> 2:06:31.840]  she has herpes. I'm saying she's like a human her pee. She just keeps coming back.
[2:06:31.840 --> 2:06:35.240]  She called me. I'm gonna cover this at the bottom of the hour for a great guest
[2:06:35.240 --> 2:06:41.040]  leaves us. Last year and told me how sexy I was. I said let me call you about five
[2:06:41.040 --> 2:06:43.740]  minutes. I had to get to the office, get another phone to record it because I
[2:06:43.740 --> 2:06:47.360]  have a recording app on my phone. I had a memo recorder but not some records calls
[2:06:47.360 --> 2:06:52.720]  so you so people can hear this crazy bull. I knew she was full of it. She'd
[2:06:52.720 --> 2:06:56.040]  already edited me saying Hillary's murdered children in the Middle East.
[2:06:56.040 --> 2:06:59.720]  She edited it together with other stuff saying I said Hillary was killing kids
[2:06:59.720 --> 2:07:05.120]  in a pizza place and so I talked to her about that and I go I don't want to get
[2:07:05.120 --> 2:07:09.840]  into Sandy Hook. I think people died there. She goes oh oh I might bring that
[2:07:09.840 --> 2:07:13.520]  up. That's not why I'm coming. The whole thing was that then she gets on TV and
[2:07:13.520 --> 2:07:19.320]  says yesterday with some of the victims families Alex just keeps bringing it up
[2:07:19.320 --> 2:07:23.520]  saying your kids didn't die. He's a monster. How dare you bring it up. I've got
[2:07:23.520 --> 2:07:26.800]  you witch. At the bottom of the hour I'm gonna play where I tell you I don't want
[2:07:26.800 --> 2:07:29.920]  to talk about it and I think people died and then you would not put it in your
[2:07:29.920 --> 2:07:34.560]  TV show and now I'm being sued for how you edited it. You are unbelievable liar.
[2:07:34.560 --> 2:07:40.720]  Excuse me. I am really mad man because because it's the whole cruiser is saying
[2:07:40.720 --> 2:07:43.880]  you're not saying that. Hillary edited a tape of me where I played devil's
[2:07:43.880 --> 2:07:47.000]  advocate and said I could see why people don't believe it because of the
[2:07:47.000 --> 2:07:50.640]  staged chemical attacks. A couple years ago I said this because of the babies and
[2:07:50.640 --> 2:07:53.760]  the incubators that get us in the Gulf War. Say they beat their brains out. That
[2:07:53.760 --> 2:07:59.480]  was a PR company. That was a young actress who never been to Kuwait. That was
[2:07:59.480 --> 2:08:03.160]  fake. They admit it but I'm gonna stop ranting. It's the whole nature of this
[2:08:03.160 --> 2:08:07.240]  current war and the last three chemical attacks and then Google says Ban Alex
[2:08:07.240 --> 2:08:11.000]  Jones because he says the chemical attacks were staged. They you and admitted it.
[2:08:11.000 --> 2:08:15.000]  I'm gonna stop right there. Tim Blacks our guest for two segments. He's got great
[2:08:15.000 --> 2:08:18.280]  audio. I want to invite him back. I know he's got a popular show. He's being
[2:08:18.280 --> 2:08:21.320]  censored. He's being blocked. He's getting shadow banned. He's being
[2:08:21.320 --> 2:08:27.080]  demonetized and CNN that's compared myself, Jimmy Doran others to pedophiles.
[2:08:27.080 --> 2:08:30.520]  You can't make this up. Go see the news report. It's on infowars.com.
[2:08:30.520 --> 2:08:38.200]  White supremacist and oh and North Korea a dictator and saying we need to be
[2:08:38.200 --> 2:08:44.320]  completely de-platformed because we're bad people. CNN's who's bad saying get
[2:08:44.320 --> 2:08:50.360]  rid of us and what's the unifying factor? We're all anti preemptive offensive
[2:08:50.360 --> 2:08:53.640]  war. You've got the floor my friend. Lay out what's happening to you. What's
[2:08:53.640 --> 2:08:57.320]  happened to others and just you're right. There's like four or five real liberals
[2:08:57.320 --> 2:09:02.280]  now that are anti-war. Now it's myself. Laura Ingraham a little bit. Tucker
[2:09:02.280 --> 2:09:05.960]  Carlson is laying out real arguments. I mean what world have we reached where
[2:09:05.960 --> 2:09:09.960]  Tucker Carlson and Alex Jones sound like Tim Black
[2:09:09.960 --> 2:09:14.520]  and sound like Jimmy Doran and then the media once us all kicked off the air.
[2:09:14.520 --> 2:09:19.800]  And we've ended a strange time Alex but you know the fact is we all want to
[2:09:19.800 --> 2:09:24.200]  report the truth. Like at the end of the day that's what we're about and the
[2:09:24.200 --> 2:09:27.400]  truth of the matter is brother we don't have a reason to go to war with Syria.
[2:09:27.400 --> 2:09:31.880]  We don't have a reason to bomb Syria. The social media censorship is rampant
[2:09:31.880 --> 2:09:35.400]  across all platforms whether it's Facebook, whether it's Twitter, whether it is
[2:09:35.400 --> 2:09:39.560]  YouTube. Now YouTube you know they're demonetizing videos. To get me Alex what
[2:09:39.560 --> 2:09:44.360]  they did was they went to a six month old video and said I was bullying the
[2:09:44.360 --> 2:09:48.280]  Las Vegas shooter. Now I don't know how they should come. How do you bully a
[2:09:48.280 --> 2:09:53.320]  mass murderer? That's the video they could have got me for other videos but
[2:09:53.320 --> 2:09:57.880]  that's the one they chose and I said well you know this is crazy. So I'm unable
[2:09:57.880 --> 2:10:01.960]  to live stream but this is not just about me. It's about all the others who
[2:10:01.960 --> 2:10:05.080]  have content that has been flagged by YouTube as being
[2:10:05.080 --> 2:10:08.280]  harassment of bullying. That is not harassment of bullying.
[2:10:08.280 --> 2:10:11.960]  That's where we are. Our live streaming was blocked for two months saying bullying.
[2:10:11.960 --> 2:10:15.320]  They just go through anybody that is an establishment and they block us. It's what
[2:10:15.320 --> 2:10:17.640]  they do. Yeah that's what they do man and they
[2:10:17.640 --> 2:10:21.960]  call us conspiracy theorists. According to that CNN article that you
[2:10:21.960 --> 2:10:25.160]  quoted earlier. You know like I know for a fact that Jimmy
[2:10:25.160 --> 2:10:29.320]  Doherty is not a conspiracy theorist. You know he asks questions.
[2:10:29.320 --> 2:10:33.000]  Alex you I think that you are a conspiracy theorist but that doesn't
[2:10:33.000 --> 2:10:36.040]  mean Alex that I don't think you should be able to
[2:10:36.040 --> 2:10:38.760]  speak. You shouldn't be able to have your platform that you should be able to
[2:10:38.760 --> 2:10:40.920]  maintain. And by the way you have a right to that?
[2:10:40.920 --> 2:10:45.560]  Absolutely and I have exactly. Absolutely yeah man. I mean that's what we
[2:10:45.560 --> 2:10:49.320]  fight for. I'm a true liberal in the sense that I want freedom of speech.
[2:10:49.320 --> 2:10:53.480]  I feel that if you have an opinion out and if I Alex if I disagree with it I
[2:10:53.480 --> 2:10:55.960]  should be able to we you know give you a retort.
[2:10:55.960 --> 2:10:59.960]  I should be able to respond to you. Not shut you down. That's not what we want
[2:10:59.960 --> 2:11:04.520]  and anyone who's truly truly about free speech would feel the same way.
[2:11:04.520 --> 2:11:06.920]  What do you think's happened at the universities? I know it's the big
[2:11:06.920 --> 2:11:10.520]  corporate money coming down to the student groups.
[2:11:10.520 --> 2:11:13.560]  That's why they're into free speech and now they're graduating and going to
[2:11:13.560 --> 2:11:17.640]  work at Google, Facebook, Twitter and it's heartless because you're
[2:11:17.640 --> 2:11:21.000]  right they're really censoring as much the conservatives
[2:11:21.000 --> 2:11:24.440]  organic leftist groups because they don't want original
[2:11:24.440 --> 2:11:28.440]  old-fashioned liberalism around. They want the new pro-war fascist
[2:11:28.440 --> 2:11:31.880]  anti-free speech version. Yeah they want that you know some people confuse
[2:11:31.880 --> 2:11:35.000]  these people with progressives. These people are not progressives. These
[2:11:35.000 --> 2:11:37.960]  people just grabbed this name because it was popular at the time.
[2:11:37.960 --> 2:11:41.640]  Unless you're anti-war, unless you're looking for universal health care,
[2:11:41.640 --> 2:11:44.760]  unless you're looking to end interventionist wars, if you're willing
[2:11:44.760 --> 2:11:49.160]  to up the minimum wage, I mean there are certain characteristics of a person
[2:11:49.160 --> 2:11:52.200]  who is truly progressive. So a lot of people get that mixed up. The same
[2:11:52.200 --> 2:11:55.720]  thing they do with you Alex, they call you alt-right. I don't I don't believe
[2:11:55.720 --> 2:11:59.000]  that you're alt-right at all but that's the label they give you because they
[2:11:59.000 --> 2:12:02.680]  they can smear you with it. So that's the same thing that happens on the left.
[2:12:02.680 --> 2:12:05.240]  Exactly. If you go to the white supremacists and people they hate me more than
[2:12:05.240 --> 2:12:09.160]  anybody for some reason. Yeah and and and you know I don't believe
[2:12:09.160 --> 2:12:12.520]  that you're a white supremacist. Why do you think the ultra leftist,
[2:12:12.520 --> 2:12:14.920]  the fake leftists hate me and the white supremacists hate me? Because if you go
[2:12:14.920 --> 2:12:17.880]  to the white supremacists, they hate me more than I mean it's like I'm there.
[2:12:17.880 --> 2:12:21.320]  I don't know why they hate me so much. They don't watch the content probably
[2:12:21.320 --> 2:12:23.880]  when they do. It's little pieces that have been
[2:12:23.880 --> 2:12:27.400]  you know have been altered or edited by someone else. The same thing happens to
[2:12:27.400 --> 2:12:30.200]  me. People assign beliefs to me that I don't have.
[2:12:30.200 --> 2:12:34.040]  You know the fact that I want to end wars and I don't agree with Joy Reeds, the
[2:12:34.040 --> 2:12:39.080]  MSNBC crew, the Clinton loyalists. The fact that I didn't vote for Hillary.
[2:12:39.080 --> 2:12:41.640]  You know I didn't vote for Trump but I didn't vote for Hillary either.
[2:12:41.640 --> 2:12:45.960]  So that's a problem for them and in fact Alex it's more of a problem for them
[2:12:45.960 --> 2:12:49.720]  that they have a person like me, a black man who's not a Democrat
[2:12:49.720 --> 2:12:53.160]  than it is to have you Alex the Libertarian.
[2:12:53.160 --> 2:12:57.400]  Absolutely but we've been put in the same nest. You talk about defamation.
[2:12:57.400 --> 2:13:00.760]  They're suing me for defamation. I didn't do as a PR so the lawyer said it'll be
[2:13:00.760 --> 2:13:05.640]  thrown out but still gonna be costly. This is defamatory putting us in with
[2:13:05.640 --> 2:13:09.640]  with pedophiles. I mean and then calling for us to be banned
[2:13:09.640 --> 2:13:13.800]  since when does the news organization go around policing everybody
[2:13:13.800 --> 2:13:16.920]  calling for their competition to be shut down. Last time I read that's called
[2:13:16.920 --> 2:13:21.880]  racketeering organized crime. Yes it's like control mind control man.
[2:13:21.880 --> 2:13:25.720]  They they they want everyone thinking the way they think based on the
[2:13:25.720 --> 2:13:28.600]  narrative they're able to put out through corporate media. I mean they can't
[2:13:28.600 --> 2:13:31.880]  control it. I don't think they had any idea that
[2:13:31.880 --> 2:13:34.760]  social media will become such a dominant force
[2:13:34.760 --> 2:13:37.960]  brother. They were caught with their pants down
[2:13:37.960 --> 2:13:40.040]  brother. They didn't see it coming and now
[2:13:40.040 --> 2:13:43.240]  they're just trying to put the toothpaste back into the tube and it's not
[2:13:43.240 --> 2:13:46.120]  going to work because we're going to win Alex. We are going to win.
[2:13:46.120 --> 2:13:49.240]  Well that's it. I said this probably to my crew 10 years ago. I said the elite
[2:13:49.240 --> 2:13:52.680]  are arrogant on the left and right. They think their big billion dollar systems
[2:13:52.680 --> 2:13:55.240]  are going to beat us. People want real content and real debate.
[2:13:55.240 --> 2:13:58.360]  We just go out and promote Americana free market. You promote some a little bit
[2:13:58.360 --> 2:14:01.560]  different but still grassroots that people want what's real.
[2:14:01.560 --> 2:14:05.480]  They want what's gritty and but once the elite figures that out you'll have a
[2:14:05.480 --> 2:14:08.440]  perfect storm of big corporations, media and government
[2:14:08.440 --> 2:14:12.440]  and the establishment wanting to shut everybody down. If they finally hit that
[2:14:12.440 --> 2:14:15.880]  panic point in the last few years and now we're seeing the big push
[2:14:15.880 --> 2:14:18.440]  and I think it's going to blow up in their face but let me ask you this. A, you
[2:14:18.440 --> 2:14:21.400]  agree with that? B, how do we counter though the massive
[2:14:21.400 --> 2:14:25.080]  sustained censorship? Yeah I do agree it's going to blow up in
[2:14:25.080 --> 2:14:28.680]  their face and I think we counted a massive censorship by continuing
[2:14:28.680 --> 2:14:32.360]  continuing to band together continuing to talk to each other.
[2:14:32.360 --> 2:14:36.440]  This is a start Alex to a dialogue. Am I going to get back
[2:14:36.440 --> 2:14:40.120]  last for talking to you? Yeah I am but you know what it's worth it to me
[2:14:40.120 --> 2:14:43.320]  because I think it needs to happen. I've been talking about we should we
[2:14:43.320 --> 2:14:46.920]  should cross the aisle that we should talk to one another and if I can't if
[2:14:46.920 --> 2:14:51.480]  I'm if I'm unwilling to risk you know bad words
[2:14:51.480 --> 2:14:55.160]  smear articles and I guess I'm really not a leader. So to be a leader you got
[2:14:55.160 --> 2:14:58.520]  to be willing to put yourself in harm's way and say okay you guys you feel that
[2:14:58.520 --> 2:15:02.040]  this shouldn't happen I think it should happen and let me tell you why.
[2:15:02.040 --> 2:15:06.440]  Because we are all against the same thing we are against the elitist and we
[2:15:06.440 --> 2:15:11.480]  got to fight against it together as one. And I'm against nuclear war and dying.
[2:15:11.480 --> 2:15:15.240]  Again that's that's another thing too brother. Yeah life is good like
[2:15:15.240 --> 2:15:18.120]  listen you know look they ask you what kind of day you have Alex
[2:15:18.120 --> 2:15:21.800]  any day above ground is a good day so let's let's see if we can keep that
[2:15:21.800 --> 2:15:24.840]  going that winning streak of being alive going for both of us.
[2:15:24.840 --> 2:15:27.160]  Exactly 10 blocks our guest will be one more segment with him and definitely
[2:15:27.160 --> 2:15:29.880]  have him back soon very popular millions and millions of listeners and

[2:15:36.680 --> 2:15:41.160]  shank demonious cult-like dribble just like the establishment Republicans
[2:15:41.160 --> 2:15:44.920]  and that's why they're all trying to shut it down right now. Tim Black's our guest

[2:20:34.680 --> 2:20:37.400]  coming up you're gonna hear the audio where i told meghan kelly when she was
[2:20:37.400 --> 2:20:39.320]  here last year i didn't want to get into standi hook
[2:20:39.320 --> 2:20:42.920]  she goes oh i could bring it up but i don't want to have an interview about
[2:20:42.920 --> 2:20:45.480]  that was what her whole interview was about she was already meeting with the
[2:20:45.480 --> 2:20:49.800]  family beforehand had it all planned and then i hear oh you brought up
[2:20:49.800 --> 2:20:54.600]  sandi hook stop it and then she does it again
[2:20:54.680 --> 2:20:59.080]  and i get sued for what was said in the interview
[2:20:59.080 --> 2:21:02.600]  but then the suit miss represents what i said
[2:21:02.600 --> 2:21:06.680]  and it's edited and it's to pit me against families that's all
[2:21:06.680 --> 2:21:10.520]  they can do it's crazy tim blacks our guest
[2:21:10.520 --> 2:21:13.880]  tim black tv dot com right now he's still
[2:21:13.880 --> 2:21:17.640]  banned from live streaming on his youtube channel
[2:21:17.640 --> 2:21:21.800]  because he's popular and because he's catching on
[2:21:21.800 --> 2:21:26.360]  and because he's anti-war remember when the left was anti-war
[2:21:26.360 --> 2:21:30.840]  remember they were pro free speech you know if the kkk
[2:21:30.840 --> 2:21:34.680]  by the way i've done this more than 15 times was out there
[2:21:34.680 --> 2:21:39.000]  trying to block people from speaking they haven't done that since the 60s 70s
[2:21:39.000 --> 2:21:42.120]  and 80s they got their asses locked up i'd go out and protest them
[2:21:42.120 --> 2:21:46.920]  but the left goes out antifa goes out for conservative speakers at universities
[2:21:46.920 --> 2:21:50.120]  you name it and then even when other liberals say well
[2:21:50.120 --> 2:21:53.240]  let's let them be here oh they try to have those professors fired
[2:21:53.240 --> 2:21:56.920]  i mean tim i'm not here bashing the left because because the right wing's
[2:21:56.920 --> 2:21:59.800]  involved trying to censor a news corps has come out and said they want to be
[2:21:59.800 --> 2:22:03.480]  part of this takeover the internet that's why i'm warning the left but man
[2:22:03.480 --> 2:22:06.120]  the average leftist person needs to understand i think what you've been
[2:22:06.120 --> 2:22:09.560]  saying is if they don't defend free speech they're going to lose theirs as
[2:22:09.560 --> 2:22:13.560]  well absolutely man we look look right now with
[2:22:13.560 --> 2:22:17.960]  their focusing on alex jones and i did a video about this and i say look
[2:22:17.960 --> 2:22:21.240]  don't laugh don't cheer for what's happening to alex jones
[2:22:21.240 --> 2:22:25.000]  because next they're going to come for you now i had no idea
[2:22:25.000 --> 2:22:29.240]  that a month later they would come for me but but what i'm saying is guys
[2:22:29.240 --> 2:22:32.200]  this is a slippery slope you know you don't get to pick and choose
[2:22:32.200 --> 2:22:35.640]  who has the microphone who's able to speak we all need to be able to have the
[2:22:35.640 --> 2:22:38.760]  microphone and also one thing this theory of thing they're using the
[2:22:38.760 --> 2:22:41.960]  theory here uh just because we don't believe i don't
[2:22:41.960 --> 2:22:46.120]  believe for instance that the syria a chemical attack has been proven
[2:22:46.120 --> 2:22:51.400]  okay so they're using anyone who who believes hey i wait no evidence i want
[2:22:51.400 --> 2:22:54.040]  to see this evidence i feel the same way about russia
[2:22:54.040 --> 2:22:57.640]  if you say russia stole our election alex if that's what they're saying
[2:22:57.640 --> 2:23:01.320]  they need to present some proof now for two years they haven't presented truth
[2:23:01.320 --> 2:23:04.200]  you know if you got it presented if you're not going to present it
[2:23:04.200 --> 2:23:06.840]  well hey i'm not going to believe it i'm not going to believe it just because
[2:23:06.840 --> 2:23:10.200]  your leaders in the corporate media tells me to believe it and what do we have
[2:23:10.200 --> 2:23:13.480]  proof of hillary stole it from bernie bragged about it
[2:23:13.480 --> 2:23:17.720]  uh i mean right there the real theft bernie would have probably beaten trump
[2:23:17.720 --> 2:23:20.280]  and i wouldn't even be glad about that he'd probably better than hillary the
[2:23:20.280 --> 2:23:24.440]  point is at least he's honest about what he stands for she stole it from him
[2:23:24.440 --> 2:23:27.800]  and she's in the wiki league saying she hates her constituents i mean she said
[2:23:27.800 --> 2:23:32.040]  the woman's a monster absolutely man i had donna brazil the one who passed the
[2:23:32.040 --> 2:23:36.120]  questions to the hillary clinton campaign she was on my show about about
[2:23:36.120 --> 2:23:39.800]  four months ago and she admitted hey i did pass the question i mean this is
[2:23:39.800 --> 2:23:43.640]  reality so folks free speech is important without free speech i wouldn't
[2:23:43.640 --> 2:23:47.240]  have been able to ask donna brazil that tough question the reality is
[2:23:47.240 --> 2:23:50.360]  we need to band together on free speech and that's what they don't like is
[2:23:50.360 --> 2:23:53.880]  there's people like you that have morals at a core level and will ask real
[2:23:53.880 --> 2:23:57.160]  questions no matter what side it's against i'll do the same thing when
[2:23:57.160 --> 2:24:00.680]  trump launched that illegal thing well some of my listeners are mad at me i blew
[2:24:00.680 --> 2:24:04.280]  up friday because i got kids man and i know we're on the wrong side of syria
[2:24:04.280 --> 2:24:08.920]  i mean i could because i'm against offensive war against innocent people
[2:24:08.920 --> 2:24:12.760]  and that's what this is this is this is badness absolutely brother yeah i did
[2:24:12.760 --> 2:24:16.120]  see your tweet about that i did see the video clip about how you felt about it
[2:24:16.120 --> 2:24:18.680]  now and actually i was i was glad to see a brother because
[2:24:18.680 --> 2:24:21.880]  we need more voices it doesn't matter what your ideology is
[2:24:21.880 --> 2:24:26.200]  we agree on this issue we agree that the syria attack was preemptive we didn't
[2:24:26.200 --> 2:24:29.800]  get the investigators in there yet they haven't given us a definitive ruling
[2:24:29.800 --> 2:24:33.160]  give me that information and then we'll decide and that's just the way we need
[2:24:33.160 --> 2:24:37.000]  to be especially when it comes look hey alex tell me why would we bomb
[2:24:37.000 --> 2:24:40.920]  a chemical facility and we think there's chemicals there why would we bomb it
[2:24:40.920 --> 2:24:44.680]  alex it makes no sense i've had ci people on and they totally agree
[2:24:44.680 --> 2:24:48.680]  no one bombs chemical facilities because it kills all the towns around it
[2:24:48.680 --> 2:24:52.360]  and so the idea that trump blew up chemicals that's not true and anybody
[2:24:52.360 --> 2:24:56.280]  who knows anything knows that's not true well a lot of people don't know
[2:24:56.280 --> 2:25:00.520]  anything alex because they watch msnbc they watch cnn they watch fox news and
[2:25:00.520 --> 2:25:03.800]  they're just listening to this narrative around and around it goes and
[2:25:03.800 --> 2:25:07.640]  that's why people like us are being censored because we try to
[2:25:07.640 --> 2:25:11.240]  we try to break that connection we try to come in with some information
[2:25:11.240 --> 2:25:15.160]  that's contrary just to wake people up and that's not what they want alex they
[2:25:15.160 --> 2:25:19.240]  they want that echo chamber of bs and and i can't stand for a brother
[2:25:19.240 --> 2:25:22.600]  and i'd rather be a fighter for truth and justice than a person who's getting
[2:25:22.600 --> 2:25:27.160]  paid well sitting behind of these lies and these narratives that's right
[2:25:27.160 --> 2:25:30.600]  and let's be clear if mainstream media put people like you on television or
[2:25:30.600 --> 2:25:33.640]  myself they get huge ratings people just want real even they don't agree with
[2:25:33.640 --> 2:25:35.960]  all of it just like cnn used to have 10 50 million
[2:25:35.960 --> 2:25:38.920]  million viewers a night it wasn't the internet killed it was cnn killed it
[2:25:38.920 --> 2:25:42.520]  on crossfire it was still established but there was some real debating it
[2:25:42.520 --> 2:25:46.040]  wasn't scripted why don't they have if they brought crossfire back
[2:25:46.040 --> 2:25:49.400]  and i guarantee you say had you and myself on there and i'm not pitching a
[2:25:49.400 --> 2:25:53.080]  job on cnn i don't want that but i'm telling you a real debate a real
[2:25:53.080 --> 2:25:55.160]  discussion you'd have 10 million viewers again
[2:25:55.160 --> 2:25:59.080]  hell when i've been on cnn they have record viewers but they can't do it
[2:25:59.080 --> 2:26:02.120]  now they can't do it man you're right it would be exciting it's
[2:26:02.120 --> 2:26:05.560]  it's two people with different ideas uh different vantage points
[2:26:05.560 --> 2:26:09.240]  respectfully disagreeing on the issues passionately you know
[2:26:09.240 --> 2:26:12.600]  voicing their feelings they're what they believe what they've uncovered
[2:26:12.600 --> 2:26:16.520]  what their journalism has led them to believe you know and that demonizing
[2:26:16.520 --> 2:26:20.120]  one another not saying you know this person's a horrible individual
[2:26:20.120 --> 2:26:24.200]  just because i disagree with them no this is about the the information this
[2:26:24.200 --> 2:26:27.000]  is about what we feel this is about what we've discovered
[2:26:27.000 --> 2:26:30.120]  the you know what what what we believe to be true
[2:26:30.120 --> 2:26:33.000]  so i think that would fail like high case frankly
[2:26:33.000 --> 2:26:36.360]  and it's i don't think they want that that's the last thing they want alex
[2:26:36.360 --> 2:26:39.640]  they they'd rather have it where they control the narrative and they do that
[2:26:39.640 --> 2:26:42.280]  online and look alex you're big as hell man you went
[2:26:42.280 --> 2:26:45.960]  2.4 million subscribers um just on youtube i don't know how many people
[2:26:45.960 --> 2:26:48.760]  get you on the radio or in serious or whatever it's
[2:26:48.760 --> 2:26:52.440]  conservatively we were up till the censorship and i'll be honest
[2:26:52.440 --> 2:26:55.320]  and they have this that in effect we're up like six million a day we're down
[2:26:55.320 --> 2:26:57.240]  about three and a half four million people a day
[2:26:57.240 --> 2:27:00.360]  one way or another and i mean some days a lot bigger but on average
[2:27:00.360 --> 2:27:03.880]  365 days a year it's that many actually tune in or watch now if you
[2:27:03.880 --> 2:27:07.320]  can't read us and see our clips i have no idea that's just on our platforms but
[2:27:07.320 --> 2:27:10.360]  it's probably then 10 million a day see our material
[2:27:10.360 --> 2:27:14.200]  that's amazing that's amazing and it's not going along with the corporate
[2:27:14.200 --> 2:27:16.920]  narrative and as long as you do that you're going to be in the crosshairs
[2:27:16.920 --> 2:27:20.920]  alex you've been doing this almost two decades you know that better than i do
[2:27:20.920 --> 2:27:23.880]  well listen i'm impressed uh tim with what you do i've seen your work before i

[2:33:27.480 --> 2:33:31.160]  if you are receiving this transmission
[2:33:31.160 --> 2:33:37.400]  you are the resistance it's alex jones
[2:33:37.400 --> 2:33:41.880]  all right earlier i called megan kelly the human
[2:33:41.880 --> 2:33:48.200]  herpes or the herpes of media she won't go away she has horrible ratings
[2:33:48.200 --> 2:33:55.720]  she is a big fat liar she's a slimy lawyer she's very unattractive in person
[2:33:55.720 --> 2:33:59.000]  and i'm not trying to be insulting her i just wish you know
[2:33:59.000 --> 2:34:03.480]  in person i found her absolutely unattractive
[2:34:03.480 --> 2:34:09.320]  and she came here and said how much she liked me and how great i was
[2:34:09.320 --> 2:34:12.760]  until she sat down for the interview and then it was all sandy hook it was all
[2:34:12.760 --> 2:34:15.800]  pizza gate and i'm like listen i don't think they're doing anything illegal at
[2:34:15.800 --> 2:34:18.680]  the pizza place it was a red herring we didn't create the story
[2:34:18.680 --> 2:34:23.160]  mainstream media did i said sandy hook i have played devil's advocate years ago
[2:34:23.160 --> 2:34:27.080]  but i believe people died there the media has edited that i i'm
[2:34:27.080 --> 2:34:30.920]  sad for the families i believe they died she edits that out
[2:34:30.920 --> 2:34:34.680]  has me debating about sandy hook and they've now sued me
[2:34:34.680 --> 2:34:41.880]  using the interview but the interview i'm saying people have a right to question
[2:34:41.880 --> 2:34:45.560]  and then i talked about in the interview one of the parents
[2:34:45.560 --> 2:34:49.240]  says we saw you know they saw his son's dead body
[2:34:49.240 --> 2:34:53.160]  that day and the media zero hedge and others pointed out well
[2:34:53.160 --> 2:34:55.400]  other parents said that they weren't allowed to see their children and so to
[2:34:55.400 --> 2:34:58.040]  the corner and all we said was we believe kids died
[2:34:58.040 --> 2:35:00.840]  this is why the internet saying let's look at zero hedge
[2:35:00.840 --> 2:35:05.240]  that's not even us so the lawyers look at that all of it it's just there's not a
[2:35:05.240 --> 2:35:08.360]  case there but i'll be honest with you people
[2:35:08.360 --> 2:35:11.720]  ask how do i handle all these attacks
[2:35:11.720 --> 2:35:15.000]  i had five different groups of people come up to me yesterday
[2:35:15.000 --> 2:35:17.800]  what was more than that if you count the mexican food restaurant i had a
[2:35:17.800 --> 2:35:20.440]  business meeting at from like seven to nine
[2:35:20.440 --> 2:35:24.120]  but i had one guy come over and say f you to me well i was sitting there at the
[2:35:24.120 --> 2:35:28.600]  table and they walked off and i didn't even get mad at him
[2:35:28.600 --> 2:35:31.400]  because i understand this is a weak minded person
[2:35:31.400 --> 2:35:36.920]  that believes the fairy tales okay and he loves the mainstream media that lied
[2:35:36.920 --> 2:35:39.160]  us into war and killed millions of people in the middle east he
[2:35:39.160 --> 2:35:44.360]  he loves the globalist he loves all this and so these are weak minded people but
[2:35:44.360 --> 2:35:49.880]  not megan kelly this disease of deception she calls me up and she says i
[2:35:49.880 --> 2:35:52.440]  really am intrigued by you you're really amazing
[2:35:52.440 --> 2:35:55.720]  she told me she thinks putin's really sexy too that was in front of our crew
[2:35:55.720 --> 2:36:00.200]  later when she was here and it's just all really weird but it's fake
[2:36:00.200 --> 2:36:03.240]  she's like oh i really want to go out to dinner with you get a steak and a dessert
[2:36:03.240 --> 2:36:07.320]  oh you're so cool and i'm just like and i've got hours more of the tape we
[2:36:07.320 --> 2:36:10.040]  never put out just because nobody wants to hear it nobody cares
[2:36:10.040 --> 2:36:15.320]  megan kelly is like kicking a dead dog politically the media will say he threatened
[2:36:15.320 --> 2:36:17.880]  her and says he's gonna kill her no it's a it's a metaphor
[2:36:17.880 --> 2:36:22.280]  she's a dead dog it's like kicking a dead dog it doesn't feel it she's already
[2:36:22.280 --> 2:36:26.280]  dying she's politically dead
[2:36:28.760 --> 2:36:31.720]  they're in the campaign she destroyed herself but she stuck a fork in it in
[2:36:31.720 --> 2:36:37.080]  texas so she made herself a focal point
[2:36:37.080 --> 2:36:40.520]  thinking alex jones was a target to take down and it just reminded everybody
[2:36:40.520 --> 2:36:45.080]  how much they hated megan kelly so she comes here
[2:36:45.080 --> 2:36:52.120]  she acts all nice she deceives and then a year later she's involved in a lawsuit
[2:36:52.120 --> 2:36:55.320]  she was involved with the families that turned out in fundraisers and planning
[2:36:55.320 --> 2:36:58.760]  an event for the show it was all about sandy hook
[2:36:58.760 --> 2:37:03.240]  and so my conversations with her i said i don't want to get into sandy hook
[2:37:03.240 --> 2:37:06.680]  i told her that what she got here too and she goes well i can just ask you about
[2:37:06.680 --> 2:37:10.440]  it but no this is just a profile that's not what it's about she gets here
[2:37:10.440 --> 2:37:13.480]  and they had sandy hook family set up for the interviews they were gonna have a
[2:37:13.480 --> 2:37:18.040]  rally at sandy hook about me i mean this is total lying
[2:37:18.040 --> 2:37:22.440]  okay that's what she does she deceives
[2:37:23.240 --> 2:37:28.120]  so to play some of these clips was i invited on these shows to say
[2:37:28.120 --> 2:37:33.400]  to the family suing me it's been years since i even played devil's advocate in
[2:37:33.400 --> 2:37:37.160]  debates where i said it all happened like was said or none of it happened i
[2:37:37.160 --> 2:37:40.600]  could see why people believe that because of as much media lying but we've
[2:37:40.600 --> 2:37:44.600]  investigated it we think it happened no it's i could see how you believe it
[2:37:44.600 --> 2:37:47.960]  didn't happen or i could see this is all fake i'd sit there and look them in the
[2:37:47.960 --> 2:37:50.920]  eyes and say i'm not the one bringing up your
[2:37:50.920 --> 2:37:52.840]  children i'm not the one bringing this back out
[2:37:52.840 --> 2:37:59.960]  megan kelly keeps saying here's her big crime in my view alex jones has no
[2:37:59.960 --> 2:38:03.960]  morals he just has nothing that's sacred he he keeps hurting these families
[2:38:03.960 --> 2:38:11.400]  he did it again last year in response to your show
[2:38:11.400 --> 2:38:15.960]  is that lost on anyone and it's not like i've got some soft spot
[2:38:15.960 --> 2:38:21.240]  on this and they've got me i can't prove it did the shooting didn't happen
[2:38:21.240 --> 2:38:24.200]  i can't even prove whether the chemical attack happened or not or who did it this
[2:38:24.200 --> 2:38:27.400]  time the other times the rebels got caught we don't know
[2:38:27.400 --> 2:38:31.640]  could the chemical attack be staged rand paul thinks so
[2:38:31.640 --> 2:38:36.280]  a lot of other experts think so it's i'm leaning that way we don't know yet
[2:38:36.280 --> 2:38:39.400]  well i get sued for saying we don't know they'll say jones says nobody ever
[2:38:39.400 --> 2:38:42.200]  died no no the new york times reports pull it up
[2:38:42.200 --> 2:38:47.560]  54 chemical attacks by isis in syria that's the new york times they're doing
[2:38:47.560 --> 2:38:50.840]  it constantly they put out videos of themselves
[2:38:50.840 --> 2:38:58.760]  screaming a la ot bar and launching it the un tested and it's saudi arabian
[2:38:58.760 --> 2:39:03.480]  i gotta hurry up i'll never get to these clips it's just insane to watch this
[2:39:03.480 --> 2:39:08.360]  we're like a washing machine it's brought up alex apologize
[2:39:08.360 --> 2:39:12.200]  say if we're attacking the families well i never attacked the families
[2:39:12.200 --> 2:39:15.560]  but i'm sorry for their loss and i think it happened
[2:39:15.560 --> 2:39:18.760]  another month say you're sorry so it's just the same crap because they think
[2:39:18.760 --> 2:39:22.120]  you don't have a memory that is the media who are using these families
[2:39:22.120 --> 2:39:25.560]  so let's go to part of the clips where we talked about this uh this is where i
[2:39:25.560 --> 2:39:29.000]  taped her uh in a pre interview because i think she was lying and then we'll go
[2:39:29.000 --> 2:39:33.080]  to what she's now doing oh my gosh alex has no heart he is
[2:39:33.080 --> 2:39:38.200]  nothing's sacred he he brought it up again no you did and lied about it you
[2:39:38.200 --> 2:39:42.520]  you you did it you did it and then i'm gonna ask the families are you
[2:39:42.520 --> 2:39:45.800]  gonna be accomplices to this
[2:39:45.800 --> 2:39:51.720]  so the gun control lobby has cheap shots because the we we have our own
[2:39:51.720 --> 2:39:56.280]  platform millions are going to see this millions are watching
[2:39:57.160 --> 2:40:00.440]  and see i pulled back the curtain one time for new this viewers
[2:40:00.440 --> 2:40:03.880]  they're never under the control again and that's why they fear us so much
[2:40:03.880 --> 2:40:07.800]  because i'm going to show what you really did lady here it is
[2:40:07.800 --> 2:40:11.640]  then good or at least an open heart would be
[2:40:11.640 --> 2:40:18.840]  hiding from evil and so that's why i let megan kelly
[2:40:18.840 --> 2:40:25.960]  set up this conflict on her own terms on our own battlefield because despite
[2:40:25.960 --> 2:40:29.560]  the fact that she was delusional and believed that she would deceive me and
[2:40:29.560 --> 2:40:32.760]  my viewers the end of the day she failed
[2:40:32.760 --> 2:40:36.360]  sure but wouldn't the argument be that in the show because i see that as a
[2:40:36.360 --> 2:40:39.080]  standard democrat talking point of months and that's what you're doing
[2:40:39.080 --> 2:40:43.400]  well he asked for privacy in his family but he didn't do that for sanding hook
[2:40:43.400 --> 2:40:47.000]  and he didn't do that for the pizzeria
[2:40:47.400 --> 2:40:51.160]  you know i mean i i can ask you about that
[2:40:51.160 --> 2:40:54.840]  this is not going to be a contentious you know
[2:40:54.840 --> 2:41:00.040]  sort of gotcha exchange i that's not what this show is and that's really not
[2:41:00.040 --> 2:41:04.920]  what i wanted to i want to do index and totals on people just
[2:41:04.920 --> 2:41:09.000]  interesting people so i can ask you that this is what the critics say but
[2:41:09.000 --> 2:41:13.480]  this isn't going to be a let's play a clip
[2:41:13.480 --> 2:41:16.280]  then it goes on from there the full interviews up on info wars dot com
[2:41:16.280 --> 2:41:19.480]  let's go ahead and roll as we go out to break then what she did yesterday
[2:41:19.480 --> 2:41:22.840]  in amongst every other channel doing the same thing is some of them even worse
[2:41:22.840 --> 2:41:26.360]  jones bullied the children and sent people to their houses to be mean to
[2:41:26.360 --> 2:41:30.600]  them and jones still says nobody died and made fun of the fault
[2:41:30.600 --> 2:41:34.840]  none of it's true but see it's just like war propaganda it's put out there to
[2:41:34.840 --> 2:41:38.280]  manipulate your feelings here it is
[2:41:38.280 --> 2:41:41.720]  because nothing is sacrosanct to alex jones
[2:41:41.720 --> 2:41:45.960]  he and his team renewed their attacks on hesslin and others last summer
[2:41:45.960 --> 2:41:53.560]  it was again that back it up again she launched it all and it says i did it
[2:41:53.560 --> 2:41:57.560]  here it is because nothing is sacrosanct
[2:41:57.560 --> 2:42:01.720]  to alex jones he and his team renewed their attacks on hesslin
[2:42:01.720 --> 2:42:05.560]  and others last summer again claiming that neil
[2:42:05.560 --> 2:42:09.720]  is a liar take a listen to their show it plus
[2:42:09.720 --> 2:42:16.520]  we did not call neil a liar you are a lying fake worn out propagandist it
[2:42:16.520 --> 2:42:19.800]  looks like you know the saturday morning shift to the
[2:42:19.800 --> 2:42:25.320]  topless bar let's go back to her fact checkers on this have said
[2:42:25.320 --> 2:42:30.920]  cannot be accurate he's claiming that he held his son
[2:42:30.920 --> 2:42:36.440]  and saw the bullet hole in his head that is his claim now according to a
[2:42:36.440 --> 2:42:40.360]  timeline of events and a coroner's testimony
[2:42:40.360 --> 2:42:45.000]  that is not possible the coroner said no the parents were allowed to touch the
[2:42:45.000 --> 2:42:48.760]  kids or see the kids and maybe they're meeting at the school i'm
[2:42:48.760 --> 2:42:51.080]  sure later maybe the parents saw their children
[2:42:51.080 --> 2:42:55.160]  the point is is that because the media lies so much
[2:42:55.160 --> 2:42:58.040]  i get arizona here on the air worldwide go ahead
[2:42:58.040 --> 2:43:01.720]  oh alex you can rent any day of the week thank you sir for doing what you do and
[2:43:01.720 --> 2:43:04.120]  being a patriot and doing your best to save
[2:43:04.120 --> 2:43:07.800]  america and encouraging us as fellow patriots to do that
[2:43:07.800 --> 2:43:12.040]  in our local areas as well and as a long time
[2:43:12.040 --> 2:43:16.200]  info words listener i want to say thanks for the awesome brain force
[2:43:16.200 --> 2:43:19.400]  anthroplex my girlfriend would like to say thanks for the anthroplex

[2:43:35.320 --> 2:43:38.680]  keep us healthy absolutely we because then we could all as
[2:43:38.680 --> 2:43:42.600]  educated patriots help our other countrymen and women
[2:43:42.600 --> 2:43:45.880]  understand that there's a bigger problems going on and if we can
[2:43:45.880 --> 2:43:49.720]  get our houses in order and be good to each other and ourselves we can take our
[2:43:49.720 --> 2:43:52.280]  country back
[2:43:52.280 --> 2:43:58.280]  introducing cell force by info wars life
[2:43:58.280 --> 2:44:02.200]  cell force focuses on mitochondria efficiency and protection
[2:44:02.200 --> 2:44:05.560]  mitochondria produce over 95 percent of your energy
[2:44:05.560 --> 2:44:10.200]  they are your body's cellular engines cell force helps promote your cellular
[2:44:10.200 --> 2:44:12.840]  energy production by supporting mitochondria
[2:44:12.840 --> 2:44:17.080]  much like a cellular engine overhaul because when your mitochondria don't run
[2:44:17.080 --> 2:44:21.160]  at 100 percent efficiency then they start producing reactive oxygen
[2:44:21.160 --> 2:44:24.600]  species top scientists agree that aging is most
[2:44:24.600 --> 2:44:28.920]  likely caused by cellular damage resulting from these reactive oxygen
[2:44:28.920 --> 2:44:32.280]  species the antioxidants found in cell
[2:44:32.280 --> 2:44:35.400]  force are some of the most powerful available on the market
[2:44:35.400 --> 2:44:39.400]  the stronger the antioxidant the better its ability to scavenge for these
[2:44:39.400 --> 2:44:43.160]  reactive oxygen species and other free radicals

[2:44:55.800 --> 2:44:58.840]  they use their media to assassinate real news
[2:44:58.840 --> 2:45:02.200]  they use their schools to teach children that their president is another
[2:45:02.200 --> 2:45:06.760]  hitler they use their movie stars and singers and comedy shows and award
[2:45:06.760 --> 2:45:10.360]  shows to repeat their narrative over and over again
[2:45:10.360 --> 2:45:14.200]  and then they use their ex-president to endorse the resistance
[2:45:14.200 --> 2:45:19.400]  all to make them march make them protest make them scream racism and sexism
[2:45:19.400 --> 2:45:23.800]  and xenophobia and homophobia to smash windows burn cars
[2:45:23.800 --> 2:45:28.040]  shut down interstates and airports bully and terrorize the law abiding
[2:45:28.040 --> 2:45:32.200]  until the only option left is for the police to do their jobs
[2:45:32.200 --> 2:45:37.000]  and stop the madness and when that happens they'll use it as an excuse for
[2:45:37.000 --> 2:45:41.560]  their outrage the only way we stop this the only way we
[2:45:41.560 --> 2:45:45.160]  save our country and our freedom is to fight
[2:45:45.160 --> 2:45:49.560]  this violence of lies with the clenched fist of truth
[2:45:49.560 --> 2:45:52.520]  i'm the national rifle association of america

[2:46:59.320 --> 2:47:15.960]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[2:47:15.960 --> 2:47:22.040]  waging war on corruption it's alex jones coming to you right from the front
[2:47:22.040 --> 2:47:26.840]  line of the info war
[2:47:26.840 --> 2:47:31.800]  so they'd have you believe that i'm this super villain like cobra commander
[2:47:31.800 --> 2:47:35.000]  well if i'm cobra commander where's baronus
[2:47:35.000 --> 2:47:37.640]  let me be a good part about cobra commander i think baronus is pretty sexy
[2:47:37.640 --> 2:47:41.400]  what do you think anyways folks uh getting back to this
[2:47:41.400 --> 2:47:46.040]  you got someone who's not sexy megan kelly and i just say that because they
[2:47:46.040 --> 2:47:48.680]  hold her up there she looks like a reanimated
[2:47:48.680 --> 2:47:55.400]  corpse a mannequin or something and she's a big fat liar and she was
[2:47:55.400 --> 2:47:59.160]  planning this whole show around sandy hook
[2:47:59.160 --> 2:48:02.280]  and they were gonna have a town hall demonizing me but they even threw her
[2:48:02.280 --> 2:48:06.040]  under the bus with the whole thing of why are you even giving him a platform
[2:48:06.040 --> 2:48:10.040]  remember that was last year's recycling and i get they have like calendars
[2:48:10.040 --> 2:48:12.920]  so you're later they're doing it again and then the next year it'll be
[2:48:12.920 --> 2:48:16.280]  jones said nobody died again and attacked the children
[2:48:16.280 --> 2:48:21.400]  and it'll be crying parents on tv and here's the deal i know the parents know
[2:48:21.400 --> 2:48:24.600]  that i've been clear about this for at least four years
[2:48:24.600 --> 2:48:27.160]  and so
[2:48:27.320 --> 2:48:30.520]  democratic party the media has picked up on this they recycle it over and over
[2:48:30.520 --> 2:48:32.760]  again and at a certain point i mean there's
[2:48:32.760 --> 2:48:36.920]  going to be an anti slap lawsuit filed and texas law is very strong on this
[2:48:36.920 --> 2:48:40.440]  we don't give away the whole strategy here but the media is going to have a
[2:48:40.440 --> 2:48:44.840]  day with that jones sues victims of sandy hook
[2:48:44.840 --> 2:48:50.120]  you sued me you said i said stuff i didn't say
[2:48:50.120 --> 2:48:54.600]  you go on shows and i don't get to go on them
[2:48:54.600 --> 2:48:58.600]  they have edited clips on there of me saying what oh i think they're probably
[2:48:58.600 --> 2:49:02.360]  telling the truth you know they probably got to see them later
[2:49:02.360 --> 2:49:07.720]  i was reporting on the zero hedge and others with anomalies
[2:49:07.720 --> 2:49:12.200]  and that's why people ask questions and governments have been caught staging
[2:49:12.200 --> 2:49:16.120]  things but i began to say sandy hook happened years
[2:49:16.120 --> 2:49:19.320]  before and they took that as weakness so i've learned how the how they work
[2:49:19.320 --> 2:49:23.000]  but the media because they're sociopaths they think i'm one they go
[2:49:23.000 --> 2:49:27.080]  oh jones is backed off on this he must be he
[2:49:27.080 --> 2:49:31.720]  know as we get more information and as the sandy hook folks not all our
[2:49:31.720 --> 2:49:34.760]  listeners some of us heard saying i was both bridges you can look this up
[2:49:34.760 --> 2:49:37.560]  and and and bill hexa that i was covering up sandy hook i'm like you know
[2:49:37.560 --> 2:49:42.760]  what i'm not into sandy hook religion i'm sick of this so these claims that i
[2:49:42.760 --> 2:49:46.440]  profit off sandy hook my listeners want to jump off a cliff when they hear about
[2:49:46.440 --> 2:49:50.040]  this the media just said that i said
[2:49:50.040 --> 2:49:53.560]  parkland didn't happen everybody knows that's not true
[2:49:53.560 --> 2:49:57.080]  so it's the media doing this this is their plan
[2:49:57.080 --> 2:50:02.680]  to bring up victims of mass shootings to like have a new mass shooting all the
[2:50:02.680 --> 2:50:04.120]  time even though they can't have them all the time
[2:50:04.120 --> 2:50:10.280]  you know the democrats stood down uh in new uh in uh sandy hook they stood down
[2:50:10.280 --> 2:50:13.880]  in parkland that's been confirmed they don't want that discussion they just
[2:50:13.880 --> 2:50:17.960]  want to bring back mass shootings over and over again to remind you of them
[2:50:17.960 --> 2:50:21.720]  to create the psychology that they're happening all the time on my back
[2:50:21.720 --> 2:50:25.480]  to create a statue to ban my speech that's the admitted plan
[2:50:25.480 --> 2:50:29.000]  all americans should be against this and see if for what it is but let's go back
[2:50:29.000 --> 2:50:31.080]  to the megan kelly clips i'm sorry here it is
[2:50:31.080 --> 2:50:34.760]  said no the parents were allowed to touch the kids or see the kids and
[2:50:34.760 --> 2:50:38.200]  maybe they meaning at the school i'm sure later maybe the parents saw their
[2:50:38.200 --> 2:50:42.280]  children the point is is that because the media
[2:50:42.280 --> 2:50:45.800]  lies so much you can't blame the public asking questions and you can't ban
[2:50:45.800 --> 2:50:48.360]  free speech of people that are asking questions
[2:50:48.360 --> 2:50:51.720]  hit plus joining me now for a second but just two seconds
[2:50:51.720 --> 2:50:56.600]  now how reasonable it was that that is what i'm being sued for
[2:50:56.600 --> 2:50:59.880]  and they add stuff in there i didn't say but that's listed word for word in the
[2:50:59.880 --> 2:51:04.760]  lawsuit you can't blame people for questioning

[2:55:31.320 --> 2:55:35.400]  collectively for anything that happens with guns you don't blame cars mr

[2:55:39.640 --> 2:55:45.560]  you're saying i'm a liar your suit says that i called you a liar i didn't
[2:55:45.560 --> 2:55:50.520]  see as we just said it's not just sandy hook but he has been going after the
[2:55:50.520 --> 2:55:52.760]  sandy hook parents from the beginning it pause again
[2:55:52.760 --> 2:55:56.600]  i have never gone after the sandy hook parents
[2:55:56.600 --> 2:56:00.120]  notice she doesn't show any clips to that
[2:56:00.760 --> 2:56:04.120]  i'm going after the parents who in the hell
[2:56:04.120 --> 2:56:08.600]  would try to go after people's parents who have dead children
[2:56:08.600 --> 2:56:11.800]  we have said that they've gotten picked up by the democrats of the media and used
[2:56:11.800 --> 2:56:14.840]  for talking points and engines hired by bloomberg
[2:56:14.840 --> 2:56:18.520]  to be flown around and give anti-gun speeches that's a fact and i'm sorry for
[2:56:18.520 --> 2:56:21.400]  your loss but i can't give up my rights
[2:56:21.400 --> 2:56:25.160]  because a projected guilt is put onto me
[2:56:25.160 --> 2:56:28.440]  that's wrong if somebody kills somebody with a baseball bat you don't blame
[2:56:28.440 --> 2:56:32.040]  louisville slugger you don't blame ginsu knives or somebody
[2:56:32.040 --> 2:56:35.480]  stabs their wife to death with it and and or you don't blame other knife

[2:56:39.240 --> 2:56:43.240]  your kitchen you're responsible what let's continue
[2:56:43.240 --> 2:56:47.160]  i know that the posers have been a woman went to jail
[2:56:47.160 --> 2:56:50.920]  for issuing death threats to them after listening
[2:56:50.920 --> 2:56:55.240]  to jones on info wars pause again and what happens is they come and tell the
[2:56:55.240 --> 2:56:58.680]  police tell them we'll let you off easy just say it's info wars
[2:56:58.680 --> 2:57:01.560]  and they go this is a woman was barred by the court from listening people are
[2:57:01.560 --> 2:57:05.080]  hearing bar the court from listening the show is so evil if you listen
[2:57:05.080 --> 2:57:09.560]  you'll start going no the same people that don't think any of these shootings
[2:57:09.560 --> 2:57:12.040]  are real come and confront my reporters and i'm not
[2:57:12.040 --> 2:57:16.200]  giving them any attention and threaten us and they've been doing it for four
[2:57:16.200 --> 2:57:19.400]  years not this particular one but others
[2:57:19.400 --> 2:57:24.120]  so again she knows this she knows they say i'm bow bridge isn't all this crap

[2:57:27.800 --> 2:57:31.400]  she knows i've issued hundreds of clarifications they're not gonna let me
[2:57:31.400 --> 2:57:35.560]  clarify because they think they're deceiving and manipulating their
[2:57:35.560 --> 2:57:40.600]  audience and that's why meghan kelly is a vampire on the dead children of
[2:57:40.600 --> 2:57:44.520]  sanding hook she's a disgusting vampire using her death to attack the first
[2:57:44.520 --> 2:57:47.640]  amendment research and put it together with our own four years

[3:00:07.560 --> 3:00:12.120]  leading a frontal assault on the lives of the new world order
[3:00:12.120 --> 3:00:22.440]  it's alex jones on the gcm radio network
[3:00:22.440 --> 3:00:26.360]  by the way we're going through all our emails and everything right now
[3:00:26.360 --> 3:00:29.560]  and we're going to be publishing some pretty powerful stuff next week
[3:00:29.560 --> 3:00:34.840]  um we have been in contact with linard posner
[3:00:34.840 --> 3:00:38.600]  for a long time i'm going to cover up his phone number right here
[3:00:38.600 --> 3:00:42.760]  we tried to get him on in a debate about this but said we had the american
[3:00:42.760 --> 3:00:45.160]  free press folks that believe the shooting happened
[3:00:45.160 --> 3:00:48.840]  on against another fella and then again the whole
[3:00:48.840 --> 3:00:52.440]  sanny hook didn't have a community got so mad that we even had a debate
[3:00:52.440 --> 3:00:56.920]  they began to say that i was involved in a cover-up i said i'm done
[3:00:56.920 --> 3:01:01.720]  and that was like three years ago because i believe kids died there
[3:01:01.720 --> 3:01:04.840]  but i did say i could see what the media and their history why so people could
[3:01:04.840 --> 3:01:07.000]  say that you know that they don't believe anything they see in the media
[3:01:07.000 --> 3:01:10.360]  once you've been lied to hundreds of times but
[3:01:10.360 --> 3:01:18.200]  here is linard posner who lost his son and he says alex
[3:01:18.200 --> 3:01:22.200]  doctor began place i'm very disappointed to see how many people
[3:01:22.200 --> 3:01:25.960]  are threatening more anger at families than lost their children in new town
[3:01:25.960 --> 3:01:30.840]  accusing us of being actors haven't we had our share of pain
[3:01:30.840 --> 3:01:34.600]  and suffering all these accusations of government involvement false flag
[3:01:34.600 --> 3:01:37.880]  let's see we're saying government involvement stand down
[3:01:37.880 --> 3:01:42.360]  they knew he was on the prozac like all the other cases that's confirmed
[3:01:42.360 --> 3:01:46.520]  see he's not saying here that i didn't say anybody died
[3:01:46.520 --> 3:01:50.280]  i used to enjoy listening to your shows
[3:01:50.280 --> 3:01:53.320]  now i feel that your type of show created these hateful people
[3:01:53.320 --> 3:01:59.720]  and they need to be reeled in now this is january 29 2013 ladies and
[3:01:59.720 --> 3:02:03.960]  gentlemen this is a month

[3:02:33.080 --> 3:02:36.520]  devil's advocate he said it's old bull addicts don't do it get out of it
[3:02:36.520 --> 3:02:39.720]  his instincts always right and sympathies with the victims and their

[3:03:16.600 --> 3:03:21.800]  and i guess if everybody wants to play this game we're gonna play it with you
[3:03:21.800 --> 3:03:24.680]  and we're gonna i don't have the time for it but they're making the big national
[3:03:24.680 --> 3:03:27.720]  issue we're digging out all the clips from three four
[3:03:27.720 --> 3:03:31.320]  years ago where i said it happened and the full clips where i go but i can see
[3:03:31.320 --> 3:03:35.240]  how people you know question and then how they edited for the hillary ads it's
[3:03:35.240 --> 3:03:39.640]  just god almighty it's just never an end to this crap man
[3:03:39.640 --> 3:03:43.240]  and i got a counter through or people won't stop doing it and i'm not looking
[3:03:43.240 --> 3:03:47.160]  forward to that but it's gotta happen unless they drop these cases
[3:03:47.160 --> 3:03:50.600]  and i'd have these families on right now i'd go on these shows and be nice and
[3:03:50.600 --> 3:03:54.360]  talk to them they don't do it because they don't want to humanize me they want
[3:03:54.360 --> 3:03:58.120]  to lie i wonder if his phone number is still good
[3:03:58.120 --> 3:04:01.480]  because i've called it rob dues talked to him erin's talked to him he never
[3:04:01.480 --> 3:04:05.160]  gone on the phone with me i've tried a few times
[3:04:06.200 --> 3:04:09.480]  if we got more emails from him
[3:04:10.680 --> 3:04:14.120]  and he sent us this article morning no a posner
[3:04:14.120 --> 3:04:19.000]  the jewish boy whose life was taken too soon i'm so sad for your son
[3:04:19.000 --> 3:04:23.640]  but you're thinking the news i killed him and that all other gun owners did
[3:04:23.640 --> 3:04:27.080]  now we've got a former prosecutor coming on discusses a little bit that linals
[3:04:27.080 --> 3:04:29.720]  going to take over i'm going to finish up with a few
[3:04:29.720 --> 3:04:32.280]  more of these clips on the other side then get linals take on and then he'll
[3:04:32.280 --> 3:04:35.720]  post the rest of the hour they're trying to shut us down because we have massive
[3:04:35.720 --> 3:04:39.320]  ratings and huge listorship we're growing despite everything they've thrown at us
[3:04:39.320 --> 3:04:42.200]  and that's what this is about they're using these families but let me tell you
[3:04:42.200 --> 3:04:46.680]  something i've talked to multiple people in the families and they know where we
[3:04:46.680 --> 3:04:49.320]  stand so when they go on the news and say all this
[3:04:49.320 --> 3:04:54.920]  they're misrepresenting where i'm at i'm so excited the new product at info wars
[3:04:54.920 --> 3:04:57.640]  life dot com in a glass bottle two month
[3:04:57.640 --> 3:05:01.720]  servings filled to the brim filled to the absolute top
[3:05:01.720 --> 3:05:06.280]  the real red pill this is a heart and brain pill
[3:05:06.280 --> 3:05:10.600]  a new tropic but it doesn't have any stimulants in it but boy does it stimulate
[3:05:10.600 --> 3:05:14.520]  because it's beyond that quite frankly uh i just went off
[3:05:14.520 --> 3:05:18.120]  what i saw medical doctors prescribing to their patients
[3:05:18.120 --> 3:05:21.480]  but it wasn't prescription but they were charging people a hundred two hundred
[3:05:21.480 --> 3:05:25.160]  dollars for the formulae and i came up with
[3:05:25.160 --> 3:05:28.040]  our own formulae working with some scientists and developers
[3:05:28.040 --> 3:05:32.920]  non-gmo made right here in america 120 capsules
[3:05:32.920 --> 3:05:36.120]  and ladies and gentlemen you add the preglonone to it
[3:05:36.120 --> 3:05:39.880]  which is the precursor to all the hormones that your body has to have to
[3:05:39.880 --> 3:05:45.000]  even make the hormones in your glands it is amazing
[3:05:45.000 --> 3:05:48.360]  red pill now available at m4warstore.com
[3:05:48.360 --> 3:05:53.400]  and your purchase fugs the operation
[3:05:53.400 --> 3:06:09.320]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[3:06:23.800 --> 3:06:35.880]  so we're back live ladies and gentlemen responding to only a thimble of the
[3:06:35.880 --> 3:06:40.440]  i checked it on like wednesday it was 33 000 articles alex jones sandy hook and
[3:06:40.440 --> 3:06:45.000]  google news every tv channel every local show
[3:06:45.000 --> 3:06:51.560]  every radio show newspapers and by the time they're done it's alex jones
[3:06:51.560 --> 3:06:54.680]  bullied the families alex jones sent people to their houses
[3:06:54.680 --> 3:06:59.560]  alex jones says none of them died alex it's just it's like a telephone game
[3:06:59.560 --> 3:07:05.000]  and it's all people like megan kelly pushing the slot
[3:07:05.000 --> 3:07:09.720]  so i just read an email from linnie posner
[3:07:09.720 --> 3:07:17.240]  of us in 2013 giving him can dolenses and asking him on the show
[3:07:17.240 --> 3:07:20.760]  i get that hillary edited tapes to me you know doing devil's advocate discussions
[3:07:20.760 --> 3:07:23.800]  but that doesn't matter when you get a tape like megan kelly does
[3:07:23.800 --> 3:07:28.120]  so it just doesn't float boats doesn't win lawsuits but i think you think it
[3:07:28.120 --> 3:07:32.680]  wins pr wars um all it does is get you
[3:07:32.680 --> 3:07:39.080]  slapback suit so the first amendment doesn't go away
[3:07:39.080 --> 3:07:43.000]  the second amendment doesn't just because people blame other people's rights
[3:07:43.000 --> 3:07:47.240]  for what a crazy person on prozac with a gun illegally does and there was a
[3:07:47.240 --> 3:07:51.640]  police stand down in sandy hook there was a police stand
[3:07:51.640 --> 3:07:54.360]  down in
[3:07:54.840 --> 3:07:59.720]  florida this year and it's the same thing over and over again and we're
[3:07:59.720 --> 3:08:04.520]  going to continue to discuss it now let's move on to the next
[3:08:04.520 --> 3:08:06.840]  clip
[3:08:08.600 --> 3:08:14.120]  they continue when the media to say that i bring up
[3:08:14.120 --> 3:08:20.840]  pizza gate pizza gate was the emails and podesta and the
[3:08:20.840 --> 3:08:24.520]  discussion of code words reportedly used in
[3:08:24.520 --> 3:08:28.600]  child pornography and things and the other podesta brother and the stuff he
[3:08:28.600 --> 3:08:31.800]  is into the you know the art he's into in the washington post little naked kids
[3:08:31.800 --> 3:08:34.920]  that's all confirmed notice podesta didn't come in after me
[3:08:34.920 --> 3:08:39.160]  20 podesta but cnn the new york times washington post all focused on a pizza
[3:08:39.160 --> 3:08:43.640]  place which no evidence of anything popped up in
[3:08:43.640 --> 3:08:47.400]  that we then secondarily covered and that the media then hung around
[3:08:47.400 --> 3:08:50.920]  our neck again to demonize the number one enemy
[3:08:50.920 --> 3:08:54.440]  so then somebody a person just so happened to be an actor i'm not saying
[3:08:54.440 --> 3:08:57.400]  he was doing this as part of any stage deal goes in and
[3:08:57.400 --> 3:09:02.360]  broadly fires around to the wall then megan kelly edits a thing for fox news
[3:09:02.360 --> 3:09:06.280]  before she left of me saying hillary was killing kids in a basement there
[3:09:06.280 --> 3:09:10.120]  but i was saying she's killing kids through what she did with the
[3:09:10.120 --> 3:09:16.360]  air of spring that's how deceptive megan kelly is
[3:09:16.360 --> 3:09:21.160]  she's the one bringing all this stuff back into the news
[3:09:21.160 --> 3:09:23.960]  she's the one doing all this and then i have to respond
[3:09:23.960 --> 3:09:26.760]  and then people say why are you bringing this back into the news
[3:09:26.760 --> 3:09:33.240]  i'm not in fact i just talked about i'm not even going to play her
[3:09:33.240 --> 3:09:37.480]  piece from yesterday about the pizza place and all that
[3:09:37.480 --> 3:09:41.080]  and and and how they've tried so hard the media to get somebody to go do
[3:09:41.080 --> 3:09:42.840]  something to that place so they can blame me
[3:09:42.840 --> 3:09:48.040]  nothing's going on there i've actually had my crew go in undercover check it
[3:09:48.040 --> 3:09:50.680]  all out eat pizza there they say it's real good pizza
[3:09:50.680 --> 3:09:53.640]  so a lot of weird liberals there weird fundraisers going on whatever that's
[3:09:53.640 --> 3:09:56.920]  liberals but you know dc crowd anywhere is weird
[3:09:56.920 --> 3:10:00.840]  but good pizza whatever that was a red herring a set up a honeypot
[3:10:00.840 --> 3:10:03.480]  not by the people involved with the pizza place by the democratic party in
[3:10:03.480 --> 3:10:05.880]  the media diverting on some little rumor on
[3:10:05.880 --> 3:10:09.800]  foreshad that no one was covering on reddit and making in the it the big
[3:10:09.800 --> 3:10:12.360]  mountain out of the molehill because the mountain was in new york
[3:10:12.360 --> 3:10:15.880]  and epstein and weiner and the clinton foundation a little black kids out of
[3:10:15.880 --> 3:10:19.320]  haydn the convictions and and the sex branding
[3:10:19.320 --> 3:10:23.400]  and the slavery and all of it that you see
[3:10:23.400 --> 3:10:27.080]  they didn't want the news but you learn you live you learn how you get chomped
[3:10:27.080 --> 3:10:30.680]  we didn't break it we didn't push it but we got targeted in it
[3:10:30.680 --> 3:10:34.840]  this is all a process of learning it's bigger than info wars
[3:10:34.840 --> 3:10:39.240]  so we're not going to that club i'm done
[3:10:39.240 --> 3:10:43.960]  the tar baby of of of the pizza place i've been trying to get out of for years
[3:10:43.960 --> 3:10:47.080]  and they always bring it back up alex jones says this is going on at the
[3:10:47.080 --> 3:10:50.280]  pizza place alex jones says none of it's true
[3:10:50.280 --> 3:10:53.640]  all of its lies they won't drop it just like sandy hook they won't leave it
[3:10:53.640 --> 3:10:56.120]  alone and then i got people calling me saying well you
[3:10:56.120 --> 3:10:59.240]  please stop doing that more weirdos are coming in i'm like
[3:10:59.240 --> 3:11:04.040]  i'm not the one doing it tell the democrats in the media to stop it
[3:11:04.040 --> 3:11:12.200]  sue megan kelly god almighty she's such a liar i'm so sick of her
[3:11:13.560 --> 3:11:18.600]  so victims mom these has to be a day of reckoning
[3:11:18.600 --> 3:11:22.280]  so let's go to posner's wife they're divorced now
[3:11:22.280 --> 3:11:28.920]  let's let's go to this poor lady there maybe she missed the show maybe she
[3:11:28.920 --> 3:11:33.160]  i found that hard to believe coming back with that i'm doing all this stuff
[3:11:33.160 --> 3:11:36.280]  it's because i'm a target folks and the media is using these families here it
[3:11:36.280 --> 3:11:39.880]  is this this lawsuit that you just filed
[3:11:39.880 --> 3:11:45.640]  with your former husband no his dad what do you hope comes out of this
[3:11:45.640 --> 3:11:51.880]  accountability no more no less um you know i think there comes a time
[3:11:51.880 --> 3:11:56.280]  when uh if there's a choice that's made over a
[3:11:56.280 --> 3:12:00.200]  relentless period of years to pedal falsehoods
[3:12:00.200 --> 3:12:06.600]  and to profit from them then there has to be a day of reckoning
[3:12:06.600 --> 3:12:10.680]  and accountability and they say that sunlight
[3:12:10.680 --> 3:12:14.760]  is a great disinfectant well i say let it shine
[3:12:14.760 --> 3:12:18.280]  but part of this lawsuit again includes an interview yeah yeah
[3:12:18.280 --> 3:12:21.160]  back up a few seconds
[3:12:21.800 --> 3:12:25.000]  megan kelly does an interview she makes it about this they're suing me for the
[3:12:25.000 --> 3:12:29.560]  interview where i say it happened and they want the falsehoods to stop that
[3:12:29.560 --> 3:12:32.680]  i'm not saying so the media says the falsehoods
[3:12:32.680 --> 3:12:36.280]  that i supposedly said but they're not guilty and as a cooper pushed the arab
[3:12:36.280 --> 3:12:38.920]  spring that killed close to a million people
[3:12:38.920 --> 3:12:43.720]  and that threw gays off buildings that's on record he says that
[3:12:43.720 --> 3:12:47.480]  soros is in the nazi collaborator he's launched all these constant lies all
[3:12:47.480 --> 3:12:51.160]  these wars all these frauds all these evil things he's done
[3:12:51.160 --> 3:12:54.280]  and he sits there the same people that told their wmds in iraq
[3:12:54.280 --> 3:12:57.560]  and looks at you and says you know what needs to happen here but notice they
[3:12:57.560 --> 3:13:01.560]  can't show it i've actually said or done because they don't have it
[3:13:01.560 --> 3:13:05.720]  they have four second clips hillary edited for ads two years ago
[3:13:05.720 --> 3:13:08.360]  so i feel good about all this because it's all going to come out
[3:13:08.360 --> 3:13:11.320]  i'm not dumb enough to be pitted against the parents it's the media doing all
[3:13:11.320 --> 3:13:15.320]  this but let's continue here it is but part of this
[3:13:15.320 --> 3:13:18.920]  lawsuit understand includes an interview that that we did together with uh
[3:13:18.920 --> 3:13:22.760]  which alex jones has been distorting i just find it
[3:13:22.760 --> 3:13:26.920]  inexcusable that this person is out there peddling these lies
[3:13:26.920 --> 3:13:30.440]  about one of the most heartbreaking of of all traction i didn't pause again
[3:13:30.440 --> 3:13:33.800]  the cnn's been caught doing all these fake chemical attack coverage
[3:13:33.800 --> 3:13:36.920]  the coopers famous for staging things with bombs going off all i says it looks
[3:13:36.920 --> 3:13:39.560]  like blue screen when he turns doesn't mean it didn't happen it means i thought
[3:13:39.560 --> 3:13:43.160]  you're in a studio something cnn's been caught doing doing interviews not on
[3:13:43.160 --> 3:13:46.840]  the streets they can control things but with a green screen
[3:13:46.840 --> 3:13:51.320]  they go shoot some video at the spot and they do it in studio that's routine
[3:13:51.320 --> 3:13:54.760]  that is not saying it didn't happen here it is but notice he said some things
[3:13:54.760 --> 3:13:58.680]  about an interview we did that's inexcusable tell us what it is cooper
[3:13:58.680 --> 3:14:02.280]  but you don't do that because you work for the cia here it is
[3:14:02.280 --> 3:14:07.160]  that's right he no longer gets to desecrate my son's memory
[3:14:07.160 --> 3:14:14.280]  he no longer gets to negate my pain and profit from it that is correct
[3:14:14.280 --> 3:14:18.120]  you and i both know where we were on that night
[3:14:18.120 --> 3:14:26.520]  and the pain that came with that event we both know where we were that night
[3:14:26.520 --> 3:14:29.560]  and the pain that came with that event they leave it all nebulous like god what
[3:14:29.560 --> 3:14:34.040]  did alex do that night i i didn't know me cooper turns his nose disappears
[3:14:34.040 --> 3:14:37.400]  they go oh that's digital fragments digital fragments go all over the page
[3:14:37.400 --> 3:14:40.920]  when it when it isn't high enough res everybody sees that
[3:14:40.920 --> 3:14:44.040]  tv that's hooked to the internet but doesn't get connected to pixels everywhere
[3:14:44.040 --> 3:14:47.080]  he turns you can see the lion's face it looks like he's in a blue screen i don't
[3:14:47.080 --> 3:14:50.920]  know what that means people brought that up like nancy grace is in a cul-de-sac
[3:14:50.920 --> 3:14:54.760]  with cars driving and you see the same ambulance go behind her another lady
[3:14:54.760 --> 3:14:59.800]  and they later admitted it was staged i don't know what they're doing over there
[3:14:59.800 --> 3:15:04.440]  i'm not saying this woman's lying i'm saying
[3:15:04.440 --> 3:15:09.240]  it looks like they were in a studio which cnn is famous for
[3:15:09.240 --> 3:15:12.200]  i mean i could go out at night and have explosions go off and on i'm here in
[3:15:12.200 --> 3:15:15.400]  austin explosions are going off don't doubt me i'm seeing in
[3:15:15.400 --> 3:15:18.760]  that's what cooper's been caught doing we're ever able to get one old skype
[3:15:18.760 --> 3:15:20.920]  going

[3:20:59.080 --> 3:21:05.720]  wow they don't tell you what i said they don't say there was no blue screen we
[3:21:05.720 --> 3:21:09.720]  were on the street together with no car sounds
[3:21:09.720 --> 3:21:14.600]  in the middle of the giant vigil and all the people they're playing the flowers
[3:21:14.600 --> 3:21:20.440]  it's just a background with the flowers of the town hall and her and anderson
[3:21:20.440 --> 3:21:23.080]  cooper and then he turns and his head shimmering and his
[3:21:23.080 --> 3:21:26.040]  nose disappears which everybody knows is a chroma key
[3:21:26.040 --> 3:21:31.000]  that does not mean that the shooting didn't happen it doesn't mean she's bad
[3:21:31.000 --> 3:21:34.600]  i'm just saying well that's what listeners wanted us to address
[3:21:34.600 --> 3:21:38.520]  that and nancy grace can you pull up the nancy grace sandy hook stuff
[3:21:38.520 --> 3:21:42.120]  because i mean that's ridiculous they're in a cul-de-sac the day after and
[3:21:42.120 --> 3:21:45.000]  there's cars going in circles and it's because i'm
[3:21:45.000 --> 3:21:48.840]  joining by such and such via satellite
[3:21:49.560 --> 3:21:54.360]  and then she's right across from the lady i don't know why they did that
[3:21:54.360 --> 3:21:59.560]  and then and grace is actually there and then the cars are going behind grace
[3:21:59.560 --> 3:22:02.760]  and then you see the same car because it's around about and you're like well
[3:22:02.760 --> 3:22:07.240]  that's the same car that's another same car okay watch that ambulance
[3:22:07.240 --> 3:22:12.200]  what the what what what is this i don't i think they almost do this to mess with
[3:22:12.200 --> 3:22:14.760]  us or something i'm serious man that's why i've
[3:22:14.760 --> 3:22:17.320]  told my crew when there's a big mass shooting or something and there's
[3:22:17.320 --> 3:22:20.520]  really crazy anomalies just wait till i get here to figure out what to do
[3:22:20.520 --> 3:22:24.520]  because they do this stuff so they can get us to say wow that's
[3:22:24.520 --> 3:22:28.200]  really weird and they oh my gosh uh why are you
[3:22:28.200 --> 3:22:31.320]  doing that you hurt me you and you're like no no we're sorry
[3:22:31.320 --> 3:22:35.080]  you hurt me and like five years later you hurt me stop hurting me
[3:22:35.080 --> 3:22:38.440]  and we're like we're not bringing you up they're talking about us we think your
[3:22:38.440 --> 3:22:42.440]  child died we're sorry we're sorry well we didn't kill him but we're sorry
[3:22:42.440 --> 3:22:45.400]  you will stop doing it you will stop doing it and you're like but i'm not
[3:22:45.400 --> 3:22:47.880]  doing it
[3:22:52.280 --> 3:22:56.120]  now this isn't the nancy grace one it's a famous one go ask rob do he'll give it
[3:22:56.120 --> 3:22:58.360]  to you we've been up and down this hundred times
[3:22:58.360 --> 3:23:02.040]  she's sitting there in like a director's chair and there's the other person
[3:23:02.040 --> 3:23:04.840]  she's talking to they're talking about how they're on satellite and the cars
[3:23:04.840 --> 3:23:07.000]  are driving around in circles around them it's it's unbelievable
[3:23:07.000 --> 3:23:10.360]  i don't know what that means but i'm allowed see what they don't want you
[3:23:10.360 --> 3:23:14.520]  doing is questioning big events they don't want you looking at things
[3:23:14.520 --> 3:23:20.040]  jones is a crazy conspiracy theorist he says that you know the rebels have been
[3:23:20.040 --> 3:23:24.040]  caught doing chemical attacks the u n admits it the pentagon admits it did you
[3:23:24.040 --> 3:23:28.840]  guys pull me the new york times i wanted 54 times isis carried out chemical
[3:23:28.840 --> 3:23:33.080]  attacks in syria print it for me just it's there it is
[3:23:33.080 --> 3:23:38.600]  did i say 52 is my memory right for 54 isis use chemical arms at least at least
[3:23:38.600 --> 3:23:43.320]  52 times in syria iraq reports this print that for me please
[3:23:43.320 --> 3:23:47.240]  it's because they shoot the videos out of themselves and then we go oh look
[3:23:47.240 --> 3:23:50.920]  Assad's winning the u.s is pulling out so is russia this just happened at the
[3:23:50.920 --> 3:23:54.840]  wrong time Assad's the dumbest dictator in the world to do this
[3:23:54.840 --> 3:23:58.680]  let me go somebody's shooting at the u.s people going to check and see what's
[3:23:58.680 --> 3:24:03.560]  a chemical attack and the u.n people because it's a war zone a rebel held
[3:24:03.560 --> 3:24:07.400]  area do you think the rebels want them in there looking for a chemical attack
[3:24:07.400 --> 3:24:11.160]  that didn't happen and then we got the footage we saw all week
[3:24:11.160 --> 3:24:15.560]  of people hit by nerve gas and the doctor if he's even a doctor's like
[3:24:15.560 --> 3:24:21.320]  he's 18 years old okay ready oh oh it is we're not saying chemical attacks don't
[3:24:21.320 --> 3:24:27.800]  happen i'm saying i know a junior high bad play when i see one
[3:24:27.800 --> 3:24:32.440]  it's like the hillary uh town hall she kept having and i was like man this looks
[3:24:32.440 --> 3:24:34.920]  like this was shot on 80 millimeter this is the
[3:24:34.920 --> 3:24:39.560]  crispest lighting everything all the people look like central casting
[3:24:39.560 --> 3:24:43.400]  this is staged and then it came out in the wiki leaks
[3:24:43.400 --> 3:24:50.360]  it was staged of course you know a production when you go watch Jurassic
[3:24:50.360 --> 3:24:54.360]  Park do you know it's Steven Spielberg movie
[3:24:54.360 --> 3:24:58.520]  how do you know something that's real versus it's not
[3:24:58.520 --> 3:25:02.040]  you know your eye knows it
[3:25:02.840 --> 3:25:08.280]  you know acting that's why you go see the rare movie
[3:25:08.280 --> 3:25:14.040]  were the acting so good like the people versus oj simpson
[3:25:14.040 --> 3:25:17.640]  parts of it weren't even that good but there were segments of that that were
[3:25:17.640 --> 3:25:23.400]  so good that i actually just been in disbelief that i and i never do
[3:25:23.400 --> 3:25:27.320]  because it was so good but see they were following real stuff and real
[3:25:27.320 --> 3:25:30.760]  transcripts is how they could do it and they lived it as real
[3:25:30.760 --> 3:25:34.440]  so as actors it was easy to kind of fit that role but
[3:25:34.440 --> 3:25:37.400]  you know when you're seeing scripted crap so am i saying this stuff didn't
[3:25:37.400 --> 3:25:39.400]  happen no they're grabbing people they're
[3:25:39.400 --> 3:25:42.040]  giving them scripts they've got agendas they got angles
[3:25:42.040 --> 3:25:45.560]  hog said he was at his house when the attacks happened
[3:25:45.560 --> 3:25:48.920]  then he said he was in the school when it began and closed the door then he said
[3:25:48.920 --> 3:25:52.840]  he was in a closet doing interviews during it
[3:25:52.840 --> 3:25:56.600]  the day we stopped questioning that is the day we roll over and die
[3:25:56.600 --> 3:26:00.760]  the shooting happened hog's an anti-gun spokesperson and we don't know
[3:26:00.760 --> 3:26:03.960]  what he really did at school because he's told us three different things
[3:26:03.960 --> 3:26:09.880]  we call bs hog and boy are his 10 minutes of fame over
[3:26:09.880 --> 3:26:13.800]  they've decided the public's not buying into his poo poo so now he's in trouble
[3:26:13.800 --> 3:26:18.520]  for never again book oh now the leftists are going to
[3:26:18.520 --> 3:26:21.640]  bring you down the leftist religion now you've
[3:26:21.640 --> 3:26:25.240]  hurt holocaust survivors see how that works
[3:26:25.240 --> 3:26:28.920]  hog mr. anti-free speech how are your boycotts going
[3:26:28.920 --> 3:26:33.720]  mr. hog here let's go to the next clip
[3:26:33.720 --> 3:26:37.080]  sandy hook parents fight back i can't even look at the young curks let's do
[3:26:37.080 --> 3:26:39.320]  kelly sandy hook father has had enough of alex
[3:26:39.320 --> 3:26:42.520]  Jones this is her on msnbc promoting her show the day before
[3:26:42.520 --> 3:26:46.120]  and her flagging ratings and but they at least have to halfway admit though this
[3:26:46.120 --> 3:26:48.920]  is the only halfway honest thing ap was more honest
[3:26:48.920 --> 3:26:52.680]  where it actually admits that i'm well here it is for yourself
[3:26:52.680 --> 3:26:56.840]  two families of children who died in the 2012 sandy hook elementary shooting are
[3:26:56.840 --> 3:27:00.760]  now suing radio host alex jones for defamation
[3:27:00.760 --> 3:27:05.640]  the controversial host of info wars his long suggested the media
[3:27:05.640 --> 3:27:09.560]  faked information about the shooting he talked about it with nbc's
[3:27:09.560 --> 3:27:14.920]  making kelly last june all of the parents decided to come out
[3:27:14.920 --> 3:27:19.640]  and and lie about their dead children i didn't say what happened to the children
[3:27:19.640 --> 3:27:24.280]  i will sit there on the air and look at every position and play devil's advocate
[3:27:24.280 --> 3:27:28.200]  was that devil's advocate the whole thing is a giant hoax
[3:27:28.200 --> 3:27:31.160]  the whole thing was fake
[3:27:32.040 --> 3:27:35.640]  yes because i remember in even that day i look back for memory
[3:27:35.640 --> 3:27:39.640]  then saying but then some of it looks like it's real but then what do you do
[3:27:39.640 --> 3:27:42.280]  when they've got the kids going in circles in and out of the building with
[3:27:42.280 --> 3:27:46.680]  their hands up i've watched the footage and it looks like a drill
[3:27:46.680 --> 3:27:52.760]  yesterday alex jones responded to the lawsuit in a video message
[3:27:53.320 --> 3:27:59.000]  i believe sandy hook happened and early on i was being bullied by internet
[3:27:59.000 --> 3:28:04.200]  folks and others to say nobody died and when i wouldn't say nobody died
[3:28:04.200 --> 3:28:07.640]  in the debates and i would actually side with those that said that people
[3:28:07.640 --> 3:28:12.680]  did die they would say that i was a government agent
[3:28:13.960 --> 3:28:16.840]  well at least they put that part out of the 10-minute thing but i lay out the
[3:28:16.840 --> 3:28:21.400]  whole truth about what happened and then when i started getting the emails and
[3:28:21.400 --> 3:28:25.800]  like mainline people were like we're gonna get you bo bridges

[3:33:16.440 --> 3:33:22.760]  he never gives up he's alex jones broadcasting from deep in the heart of
[3:33:22.760 --> 3:33:26.840]  texas
[3:33:35.960 --> 3:33:40.120]  yeah we've been pulling up the emails and videos of what i said
[3:33:40.120 --> 3:33:43.320]  three and a half four even almost five years ago
[3:33:43.320 --> 3:33:47.160]  about sandy hook and it's it's really painstaking to find
[3:33:47.160 --> 3:33:51.480]  where they found the clips where i say i can now see how people think the whole
[3:33:51.480 --> 3:33:54.760]  thing staged nothing happened they cut that out
[3:33:54.760 --> 3:33:58.120]  versus though that i think it did happen blah blah blah and the democrats are
[3:33:58.120 --> 3:34:03.320]  trying to grab this and use this as a way to keep bringing up gun control
[3:34:03.320 --> 3:34:05.640]  because they don't get the school shootings the democrats and their victim
[3:34:05.640 --> 3:34:10.360]  disarmament zones so lust after with their police stand downs often enough
[3:34:10.360 --> 3:34:13.960]  uh so there's a way to recycle it just bring up alex jones is attacking the
[3:34:13.960 --> 3:34:19.000]  families and it is true fake news but that more emails here with parents
[3:34:19.000 --> 3:34:22.120]  and we're getting the videos together and that's why they want to shut down our
[3:34:22.120 --> 3:34:25.480]  youtube channel because they don't want us to fire back
[3:34:25.480 --> 3:34:30.120]  seeing in wants to have our videos taken down for saying nobody died at parkland
[3:34:30.120 --> 3:34:33.720]  should not be able to say that even though i didn't
[3:34:34.680 --> 3:34:37.800]  because they can't stand it the videos didn't say that they talked about the
[3:34:37.800 --> 3:34:42.680]  police stand down but they didn't go oh we took alex jones's videos down
[3:34:42.680 --> 3:34:48.840]  because he exposed the police stand down with witnesses
[3:34:48.840 --> 3:34:54.840]  no no let's misrepresent cnn nbc these are villains
[3:34:57.880 --> 3:35:02.840]  so our investigation is moving forward and no doubt i'm making a sandy hook
[3:35:02.840 --> 3:35:09.960]  documentary about it about the stand down about how they i mean i've made a
[3:35:09.960 --> 3:35:13.560]  film in six years i've been so busy and boy i used to have films got watched 30 40
[3:35:13.560 --> 3:35:19.800]  million times this is it i'm making a sandy hook film and i'm gonna lovingly
[3:35:19.800 --> 3:35:23.400]  seek out all the parents and give them their say and i'm gonna show how the
[3:35:23.400 --> 3:35:26.760]  shooting happened and i'm gonna show how he was on prozac and how he got a gun
[3:35:26.760 --> 3:35:30.520]  illegally now they bulldoze his house in the school
[3:35:30.520 --> 3:35:33.720]  and then how the media over the years did all this stuff and then how they blamed
[3:35:33.720 --> 3:35:37.000]  me for parkland and said i said it didn't happen and now the lawsuit it'll be it'll
[3:35:37.000 --> 3:35:44.520]  be all of it the whole thing
[3:35:44.520 --> 3:35:48.840]  i don't know what you call the film this is the sandy hook phenomenon the
[3:35:48.840 --> 3:35:55.400]  sandy hook versus the first amendment sandy hook versus reality
[3:35:55.400 --> 3:35:58.280]  not that the shooting didn't happen but that the how it's been used now to
[3:35:58.280 --> 3:36:01.960]  misrepresent everything this is their big key it's not just get alex
[3:36:01.960 --> 3:36:05.960]  jones they want to create the alex jones precedent
[3:36:05.960 --> 3:36:10.520]  the alex jones statute they say that they want to preemptively have the court
[3:36:10.520 --> 3:36:13.480]  say we're going to sue you out of existence in rule
[3:36:13.480 --> 3:36:18.040]  against you if you question gas attacks
[3:36:18.600 --> 3:36:21.560]  oh but rand paul's doing it too isn't he and everybody else that's got a brain
[3:36:21.560 --> 3:36:24.200]  in our own military and the head of british special forces because the
[3:36:24.200 --> 3:36:30.680]  rebels have done this is the new york times your god
[3:36:30.680 --> 3:36:35.800]  occasionally tells the truth isis use chemical arms at least 52 times in
[3:36:35.800 --> 3:36:43.160]  syria and iraq 2016 i mean that's a fact
[3:36:43.160 --> 3:36:46.840]  and then it goes into london based intelligence collection analysis service
[3:36:46.840 --> 3:36:52.200]  ihs confirms what the un found well it ain't hard to do that
[3:36:52.200 --> 3:36:56.680]  if i had a multimillion dollar funded uh think tank which is fine with me i'm
[3:36:56.680 --> 3:36:59.240]  not saying they're bad i could sit there and get a
[3:36:59.240 --> 3:37:03.160]  scientist on the board and military analysts and
[3:37:03.160 --> 3:37:06.360]  watch the isis videos to confirm what town they're in and
[3:37:06.360 --> 3:37:10.040]  show the mortar they're firing and check it and wane jane's weapons quarterly and
[3:37:10.040 --> 3:37:14.120]  that's a saudi arabian sarin gas
[3:37:14.920 --> 3:37:18.360]  30 kilo munition
[3:37:20.760 --> 3:37:26.040]  and this cream and all hot bar and they got what unit they're with with isis
[3:37:26.280 --> 3:37:32.360]  i mean yeah it's not hard man okay so they stage this stuff continually we've
[3:37:32.360 --> 3:37:35.720]  got to look at everything with the john decide once we
[3:37:35.720 --> 3:37:39.880]  don't have proof at stage that's fine and the media humanizes families and all
[3:37:39.880 --> 3:37:42.040]  this
[3:37:43.320 --> 3:37:46.120]  but what the kids are telling people is they got brought in and got sprayed with
[3:37:46.120 --> 3:37:48.920]  water i mean you get hit with any type of
[3:37:48.920 --> 3:37:51.960]  gas even chlorine yeah show the fake footage from this week

[3:38:16.520 --> 3:38:20.520]  victims blue feces coming out bleeding out of the mouth
[3:38:20.520 --> 3:38:24.120]  say jones said this didn't happen and they never show you this
[3:38:24.120 --> 3:38:31.240]  see how that works that's the tactics of these people
[3:38:31.240 --> 3:38:36.360]  slight of hand manipulation
[3:38:37.000 --> 3:38:40.200]  and they do it over and over again and they are so
[3:38:40.200 --> 3:38:44.360]  incredibly pissed off right now that these kids are going on tv and going no
[3:38:44.360 --> 3:38:49.480]  they grabbed me they brought me in

[3:54:29.000 --> 3:54:32.440]  four years serving that dance dance with mines and i had a buddy in mine that was
[3:54:32.440 --> 3:54:35.800]  an infantry he got out a few years ago and that first
[3:54:35.800 --> 3:54:38.920]  syria attack with the gas attack when everybody was like oh
[3:54:38.920 --> 3:54:42.920]  you know crazy stuff going on some things just didn't add up and i called my
[3:54:42.920 --> 3:54:46.120]  buddy and i said hey i don't i don't think that looks right i don't
[3:54:46.120 --> 3:54:49.480]  some things aren't fitting together and he said well he's got
[3:54:49.480 --> 3:54:53.320]  friends that are civilians over in syria and he said that
[3:54:53.320 --> 3:54:57.320]  they said they don't know what's going on if there was a gas attack they'd know
[3:54:57.320 --> 3:55:01.000]  about it and he said i don't know what to believe anymore and i said the same
[3:55:01.000 --> 3:55:03.880]  thing i don't know either and that was a few years back
[3:55:03.880 --> 3:55:08.440]  well the u n even the new york times says the gas attacks are faking some to ices
[3:55:08.440 --> 3:55:12.040]  because it's not like they totally control ices they give them the weapons
[3:55:12.040 --> 3:55:15.080]  and then ices can't stop videotaping it because you know they want to get that
[3:55:15.080 --> 3:55:18.680]  a la awk bar like over here it's like you're cool of your professional wrestler
[3:55:18.680 --> 3:55:22.520]  or rock star like the rolling stones or hulk hogan over
[3:55:22.520 --> 3:55:25.960]  there as you know as marine putting those videos out of them launching attacks
[3:55:25.960 --> 3:55:29.800]  make some rock stars and they get money so they can't we have all the videos of
[3:55:29.800 --> 3:55:34.280]  ices launching the attacks i agree and you you stated also
[3:55:34.280 --> 3:55:37.400]  about uh why would they why would they do a chemical attack on a small
[3:55:37.400 --> 3:55:41.240]  population and civilian that's the same thing with me i don't know if they were
[3:55:41.240 --> 3:55:44.040]  going to use them they would use them on an enemy and
[3:55:44.040 --> 3:55:47.160]  mass but yeah you don't use chemical weapons like
[3:55:47.160 --> 3:55:50.760]  you said in an emergency if you're being overwhelmed fire some mortars some
[3:55:50.760 --> 3:55:54.040]  stuff at them to knock out tank battalions exactly it's a world war three
[3:55:54.040 --> 3:55:57.160]  weapon and you only use it in total emergency plus a sod gave them up let me
[3:55:57.160 --> 3:56:00.760]  ask this is marine i'm sure they told you if you ever find chemical weapons
[3:56:00.760 --> 3:56:06.920]  don't blow them up in place yes because it rains them down on everybody
[3:56:06.920 --> 3:56:10.840]  and i and i if i remember right if we ever had a
