[00:00.000 --> 00:08.000]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[00:08.000 --> 00:10.000]  You want to stop tyranny?
[00:10.000 --> 00:12.000]  Well, so does he.
[00:12.000 --> 00:18.000]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:18.000 --> 00:23.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, the enemy is now completely out in the open.
[00:23.000 --> 00:31.000]  Our headlines all over the international press celebrating the end of humanity.
[00:31.000 --> 00:33.000]  I've got Politico right here in my hands.
[00:33.000 --> 00:35.000]  No more babies.
[00:35.000 --> 00:38.000]  The hormone-altering chemicals threatening human production.
[00:38.000 --> 00:43.000]  But it goes on to say this will save the earth from the evil humans.
[00:43.000 --> 00:48.000]  How many decades ago did I detail all of this for you?
[00:48.000 --> 00:54.000]  But first, let's take a look at what transpired on last time's episode.
[00:54.000 --> 00:57.000]  Don't let the enemy get you depressed about what's happening today.
[00:57.000 --> 01:02.000]  As long as you're speaking up, as long as you're standing up, as long as you're saying no to the globalists,
[01:02.000 --> 01:05.000]  as long as you're living and loving your neighbors and being a good person,
[01:05.000 --> 01:09.000]  you're building the human community that is the American dream and is the Renaissance.
[01:09.000 --> 01:25.000]  1776 is the answer to 1984.
[01:25.000 --> 01:28.000]  And this Irishman who's now an American, he said,
[01:28.000 --> 01:30.000]  listen, you don't get Joe Biden's name right.
[01:30.000 --> 01:32.000]  He's a stooge.
[01:32.000 --> 01:33.000]  And I said, wow, you're right.
[01:33.000 --> 01:37.000]  A stooge is a puppet put in by somebody else who's an idiot,
[01:37.000 --> 01:42.000]  but who's also used to rule over people so the stooge gets the blame
[01:42.000 --> 01:46.000]  and the actual controllers don't get the blame for the crimes they're committing.
[01:46.000 --> 01:47.000]  He said that's exactly right.
[01:47.000 --> 01:48.000]  He is a puppet.
[01:48.000 --> 01:50.000]  He is an ambassador.
[01:50.000 --> 01:51.000]  He is a fraud.
[01:51.000 --> 01:56.000]  So everybody should look at the different definitions of stooges and understand what that is.
[01:56.000 --> 01:58.000]  That's what he is.
[01:58.000 --> 01:59.000]  I just want to thank you both.
[01:59.000 --> 02:03.000]  And I want to thank the former general.
[02:03.000 --> 02:09.000]  I keep calling him general, the guy who runs that outfit over there.
[02:09.000 --> 02:17.000]  I want to make sure we thank the secretary for all he's done to try to implement what we just talked about
[02:17.000 --> 02:21.000]  and for recommending these two women for promotion.
[02:21.000 --> 02:24.000]  You know, the Dune books by Frank Herbert are amazing.
[02:24.000 --> 02:30.000]  The movie by Lynch was powerful but also cheesy at parts.
[02:30.000 --> 02:37.000]  But it's accurate as a historical fiction reference to some of the things
[02:37.000 --> 02:39.000]  that have actually happened in the real world.
[02:39.000 --> 02:45.000]  And if you notice, Bering Harkinen is supposedly losing control of the planet Arrakis with a spice,
[02:45.000 --> 02:51.000]  which is basically life is ancient technology, the ethos of the globalist, eternal life.
[02:51.000 --> 02:57.000]  But really they're just setting up the main rival of the emperor, Duke of Trades.
[02:57.000 --> 03:04.000]  But before, after he set up the Trades and his sons had thrown out of the desert and all the rest of it,
[03:04.000 --> 03:11.000]  he sends in the beast Rebonne, his nephew, to squeeze and attack and destroy all his opposition.
[03:11.000 --> 03:18.000]  But then he removes him later, gives him the blame, and puts in Fade Rebonne,
[03:18.000 --> 03:21.000]  who he really wants to be his main heir as the saviour.
[03:21.000 --> 03:26.000]  So they put him under tyranny this side, and then Fade comes in
[03:26.000 --> 03:29.000]  and the tyranny is still really high, and they would have hated Fade.
[03:29.000 --> 03:35.000]  But because the tyranny was so much higher before, they now accept that new benchmark of tyranny.
[03:35.000 --> 03:43.000]  Fade, Rebonne, go quiet.
[03:43.000 --> 03:51.000]  No other great house of the landst rod must ever know of the emperor's aid to the baron.
[03:51.000 --> 03:58.000]  The entire landst rod would turn against the baron and the emperor.
[03:58.000 --> 04:03.000]  Put the pick in there, Pete, and turn it round.
[04:03.000 --> 04:09.000]  And that's what you do with a stooge who you put in as a viceroy or a vice king.
[04:09.000 --> 04:14.000]  And the Romans would do this, the British Empire would do this, the French would do this.
[04:14.000 --> 04:17.000]  It's in the history books that they would come in a press group, take them over,
[04:17.000 --> 04:21.000]  pull it in somebody to be unpopular, to squeeze and be a tyrant.
[04:21.000 --> 04:25.000]  Then their own publications and own heralds would demonize that person,
[04:25.000 --> 04:29.000]  remove them, sometimes chop their head off, and then bring in the new tyrant
[04:29.000 --> 04:37.000]  who would loosen up some of the controls, but not as much as it was before they invaded.
[04:37.000 --> 04:41.000]  So he'd tighten down, then you loosen up, but not as much as you did before.
[04:41.000 --> 04:44.000]  And that's where a stooge comes in.
[04:44.000 --> 04:47.000]  And that's really what Joe Biden is.
[04:47.000 --> 04:50.000]  Joe Biden is a stooge, Joe Biden is a puppet.
[04:50.000 --> 04:52.000]  We should all start calling him Joe Biden's stooge.
[04:52.000 --> 04:57.000]  So that said, they brought him in, they're going to blame him for all the collapse of the economy.
[05:02.000 --> 05:06.000]  Look, I've proven that Info War's information is some of the best in the world.
[05:06.000 --> 05:09.000]  It's just absolutely on target.
[05:09.000 --> 05:12.000]  The globalists can't stand us because we've studied how they operate.
[05:12.000 --> 05:14.000]  They want to keep you in the dark.
[05:14.000 --> 05:16.000]  I believe in humanity, and I want to see you empowered,
[05:16.000 --> 05:18.000]  because I know that John F. Kennedy was right.
[05:18.000 --> 05:21.000]  A raising tide raises all ships.
[05:21.000 --> 05:25.000]  Now, the supplements, the vitamins, the minerals, the compounds we have
[05:25.000 --> 05:29.000]  at infowarstore.com are the very best sourced,
[05:29.000 --> 05:33.000]  wildcrafted, organic, and natural products you're going to find anywhere.
[05:33.000 --> 05:36.000]  Whether it's natural defense, or whether it's Ultra-12,
[05:36.000 --> 05:41.000]  or whether it's X2, or DNA Force Plus, or Prostagard, or Vasovics,
[05:41.000 --> 05:45.000]  these are all cutting-edge, top-of-the-line products
[05:45.000 --> 05:48.000]  that will help you and your family at the same time from the Info War.
[05:48.000 --> 05:50.000]  So don't procrastinate.
[05:50.000 --> 06:16.000]  Take action today at infowarstore.com.
[06:16.000 --> 06:21.000]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[06:21.000 --> 06:28.000]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[06:28.000 --> 06:31.000]  It's Tuesday, March 16th.
[06:31.000 --> 06:33.000]  The year is 2021.
[06:33.000 --> 06:35.000]  We are no longer in beta.
[06:35.000 --> 06:38.000]  We are now under globalist attack.
[06:38.000 --> 06:41.000]  The planetary depopulation has begun.
[06:41.000 --> 06:44.000]  We have cracked the code on their exact operations,
[06:44.000 --> 06:47.000]  what is going to unfold, and how to stop them.
[06:47.000 --> 06:49.000]  It's going to become increasingly obvious to everyone
[06:49.000 --> 06:52.000]  that we're inside a world government extermination operation.
[06:52.000 --> 06:56.000]  Now, you're expecting people to resist that and fight that once they figure it out,
[06:56.000 --> 06:57.000]  and they are going to.
[06:57.000 --> 07:01.000]  But a large portion of people will actually join with it once it's evident.
[07:01.000 --> 07:03.000]  They will actually go under Mass Stockholm Syndrome
[07:03.000 --> 07:06.000]  and actually consciously serve the evil.
[07:06.000 --> 07:10.000]  So we are far from out of the woods, but we got a jump on the enemy,
[07:10.000 --> 07:13.000]  and we're able to warn people about their exact plans for decades ahead of it happening.
[07:13.000 --> 07:18.000]  Let me give you some of the incredibly serious headlines today.
[07:18.000 --> 07:24.000]  Top Scientist warns, Top Scientist, Top Vaccine Scientist warns the world,
[07:24.000 --> 07:27.000]  halt all COVID-19 vaccinations immediately,
[07:27.000 --> 07:31.000]  or quote, Uncontrollable Monster will be released.
[07:31.000 --> 07:33.000]  We're breaking that down coming up today.
[07:33.000 --> 07:35.000]  Here's Politico.
[07:35.000 --> 07:36.000]  No more babies.
[07:36.000 --> 07:39.000]  The hormone altering chemicals threaten human production.
[07:39.000 --> 07:43.000]  Sperm counts are set to reach zero by 2045.
[07:43.000 --> 07:45.000]  Leading scholar breaks down.
[07:45.000 --> 07:50.000]  They go on to say this is good to save the earth because humans are bad.
[07:50.000 --> 07:53.000]  There's a looming solution to all of humanity's problems.
[07:53.000 --> 07:59.000]  By 2024, most men may no longer be able to reproduce because of chemicals in the water.
[07:59.000 --> 08:03.000]  Where did you hear that before?
[08:03.000 --> 08:08.000]  2016, Alex Jones radio host who once peers Morgan Deported says,
[08:08.000 --> 08:10.000]  the government creating gays with chemicals.
[08:10.000 --> 08:12.000]  That's not actually what I said.
[08:12.000 --> 08:15.000]  I said that this is a mass chemical operation in other animals.
[08:15.000 --> 08:17.000]  It makes them be attracted to the same sex.
[08:17.000 --> 08:19.000]  What are the sperm telling us?
[08:19.000 --> 08:22.000]  New York Times suddenly admitting I'm right.
[08:22.000 --> 08:23.000]  It goes on and on.
[08:23.000 --> 08:28.000]  Now they're creating a sperm vault to house it on the moon because of total collapse.
[08:28.000 --> 08:34.000]  They've already built a Rockefeller-backed, UN-backed seed arc in the Arctic.
[08:34.000 --> 08:38.000]  And then we've got the Wall Street Journal article that you guys will print for me again.
[08:38.000 --> 08:44.000]  Please, with the headline, looking forward to the end of humanity or the NBC headline.
[08:44.000 --> 08:49.000]  About how top globalists are going to save us by getting rid of humans and merging us with machines
[08:49.000 --> 08:54.000]  that won't produce the devil gas carbon dioxide that plants breathe.
[08:54.000 --> 08:57.000]  I don't know if aliens run this, but it sounds like an alien script from a movie
[08:57.000 --> 09:00.000]  where they come here to buy off the establishment for life extension.
[09:00.000 --> 09:02.000]  But they've got to, quote, get rid of the carbon.
[09:02.000 --> 09:03.000]  We are carbon.
[09:03.000 --> 09:05.000]  Unbelievable.
[09:05.000 --> 09:07.000]  That's just that stack here.
[09:07.000 --> 09:11.000]  20 nations banning the AstraZeneca vaccine.
[09:11.000 --> 09:15.000]  Which, again, I noticed even enemy publications going along with that saying,
[09:15.000 --> 09:17.000]  ban it, ban it, ban it.
[09:17.000 --> 09:23.000]  That's to make mRNA look safe when it's the real one, killing people in mass from Moderna and from Pfizer.
[09:23.000 --> 09:25.000]  And I'm not saying take the other ones as well.
[09:25.000 --> 09:32.000]  They are virus vector vaccines that inject viruses directly into your cells to reprogram your body.
[09:32.000 --> 09:34.000]  Simply insane.
[09:34.000 --> 09:36.000]  And again, it's too able to fail.
[09:36.000 --> 09:40.000]  Once they get society to sign on to this, the schools, the lawyers, the doctors,
[09:40.000 --> 09:44.000]  they won't be able to admit they were part of a massive crime.
[09:44.000 --> 09:49.000]  And so as, just like they got away with giving hundreds of millions of boys autism with the vaccines,
[09:49.000 --> 09:54.000]  now when they kill billions, a lot of people die right when they get the shot,
[09:54.000 --> 09:56.000]  but most people are going to be sterile.
[09:56.000 --> 09:58.000]  They're going to develop cancer.
[09:58.000 --> 10:06.000]  By the way, I have a stack of news articles, a stack of news articles confirming,
[10:06.000 --> 10:11.000]  absolutely admitted that the mRNA vaccine causes cancer,
[10:11.000 --> 10:17.000]  major prestigious reports from major universities that will cover at the bottom of the hour.
[10:17.000 --> 10:19.000]  By the way, I sent that to the producer.
[10:19.000 --> 10:20.000]  They may have given it to me.
[10:20.000 --> 10:21.000]  I did not see it in my stacks.
[10:21.000 --> 10:26.000]  I see in the university reports about mRNA is what turns on cancer, not DNA.
[10:26.000 --> 10:28.000]  Basically, DNA doesn't ever produce cancer.
[10:28.000 --> 10:29.000]  They've not discovered.
[10:29.000 --> 10:30.000]  They've done this for decades.
[10:30.000 --> 10:33.000]  It's mRNA.
[10:33.000 --> 10:38.000]  And when they put fake mRNA in that has any errors, it is what causes the cancer.
[10:38.000 --> 10:41.000]  So again, almost all cancer is viral.
[10:41.000 --> 10:47.000]  That's all viruses are as pieces of RNA and mRNA.
[10:47.000 --> 10:48.000]  And that's mainline science.
[10:48.000 --> 10:50.000]  And so the globalists know this.
[10:50.000 --> 10:55.000]  So they're injecting you with something that turns off proteins in your body that block cancer.
[10:55.000 --> 11:01.000]  So I'm going to be reading that report coming up for you today.
[11:01.000 --> 11:02.000]  There it is.
[11:02.000 --> 11:07.000]  In a twist, scientists find cancer drivers hidden in RNA, not DNA.
[11:07.000 --> 11:10.000]  Read the whole article.
[11:10.000 --> 11:14.000]  They admit that almost all cancer, they say they can't find it in DNA.
[11:14.000 --> 11:17.000]  Before they were saying, oh, it's mistakes in your DNA.
[11:17.000 --> 11:24.000]  No, when you have a certain type of DNA, it's more susceptible to the keys that are the mRNA.
[11:24.000 --> 11:30.000]  Certain viruses can get into your DNA when you, quote, have those defects.
[11:30.000 --> 11:33.000]  But all that means is you're not designed to be running into those type of things.
[11:33.000 --> 11:35.000]  But here's Bill Gates in mass running all this.
[11:35.000 --> 11:38.000]  He says he wants to depopulate you.
[11:38.000 --> 11:53.000]  Here is the open articles admitting, oh, in Politico, how wonderful, how glorious, how fantastic it's going to be.
[11:53.000 --> 11:59.000]  Once all of the people are gotten rid of, there's a looming solution to all of humanity's problems.
[11:59.000 --> 12:04.000]  By 2024, most men will be able to reproduce.
[12:04.000 --> 12:06.000]  And we all know that men are the problems.
[12:06.000 --> 12:09.000]  Men have to be gotten rid of.
[12:09.000 --> 12:15.000]  Here's the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, one of the most respected in the world.
[12:15.000 --> 12:24.000]  In the article three years ago, you just spent hours doing your own research that it is the mRNA is basically the sole source of cancer.
[12:24.000 --> 12:25.000]  What is mRNA?
[12:25.000 --> 12:27.000]  It is a virus.
[12:27.000 --> 12:32.000]  What is the AstraZeneca vaccine, a virus injected in?
[12:32.000 --> 12:34.000]  What is the Johnson & Johnson's?
[12:34.000 --> 12:41.000]  It is a virally delivered vaccine carrying the viral payload.
[12:41.000 --> 12:47.000]  Two viruses combined into your DNA to program it, to kill itself.
[12:47.000 --> 12:52.000]  And they're telling you in the Wall Street Journal in NBC, oh, everyone's going to be dead soon.
[12:52.000 --> 12:53.000]  You're all going to die.
[12:53.000 --> 12:59.000]  The earth is going to be free of the humans, free of the humans and a little demonic elf.
[12:59.000 --> 13:08.000]  Dancing around and we are just watching all of this unfold on a mass scale, ladies and gentlemen.
[13:08.000 --> 13:14.000]  So I ask you again, when are you going to wake up out of the trance?
[13:14.000 --> 13:21.000]  When are you going to come out of it and realize you're under attack that they are incrementally bringing you into this system?
[13:21.000 --> 13:26.000]  And that we need men and women to be leaders and educate themselves and say no.
[13:26.000 --> 13:31.000]  We have thousands and thousands of scientists and virologists and geneticists and doctors and nurses.
[13:31.000 --> 13:32.000]  Thousands have gone public.
[13:32.000 --> 13:34.000]  I know I'm saying this is a nightmare.
[13:34.000 --> 13:35.000]  This is death.
[13:35.000 --> 13:36.000]  This is insane.
[13:36.000 --> 13:37.000]  This has got to be stopped.
[13:37.000 --> 13:39.000]  And then on the other side, what protects you?
[13:39.000 --> 13:42.000]  The vitamins, the minerals, the D3, the zinc, the C.
[13:42.000 --> 13:44.000]  Oh, they don't want that known.
[13:44.000 --> 13:50.000]  Oh, the FBI raids doctors that are telling their patients to protect yourselves with vitamin C.
[13:50.000 --> 13:54.000]  Well, the UN didn't say you could tell somebody that.
[13:54.000 --> 13:57.000]  FBI, gee, man, with machine guns.
[13:57.000 --> 14:02.000]  Because you're going to take your death shot.
[14:02.000 --> 14:05.000]  You're going to take it and you're going to develop cancer.
[14:05.000 --> 14:11.000]  And the FBI is going to be there to make sure you and your children die and never speak up too much while you're dying.
[14:11.000 --> 14:15.000]  It doesn't matter if India bans the mRNA Pfizer.
[14:15.000 --> 14:16.000]  Oh, remember the big fat check?
[14:16.000 --> 14:18.000]  Guys, print that for me.
[14:18.000 --> 14:19.000]  Oh, actually, I did.
[14:19.000 --> 14:20.000]  I printed it myself this morning.
[14:20.000 --> 14:22.000]  I forgot it was right over here.
[14:22.000 --> 14:24.000]  This didn't age too well, did it?
[14:24.000 --> 14:27.000]  This didn't age too well a few weeks ago.
[14:27.000 --> 14:35.000]  February 20th Newsweek Fat Check claims India vaccine ban mostly falls while admitting de facto ban.
[14:35.000 --> 14:39.000]  Says Alex Jones is a liar and then admits it's sponsored by Bill Gates.
[14:39.000 --> 14:41.000]  Who's banned in India.
[14:41.000 --> 14:42.000]  Remember that?
[14:42.000 --> 14:45.000]  Oh, and now here we are a month later.
[14:45.000 --> 14:47.000]  That's a little less than a month later.
[14:47.000 --> 14:54.000]  Here we are three weeks later and it's been banned in more countries and so the other vaccines because they're not.
[14:54.000 --> 14:57.000]  It's America under Chinese attack under global attack.
[14:57.000 --> 15:05.000]  So we're going to take it and your 501 C3 devil churches are going to tell you have a passcode to come in and a QR code.
[15:05.000 --> 15:12.000]  And you got to have the shot the mark of the beast to sit there while that devil preacher probably a big fat pedophile.
[15:12.000 --> 15:20.000]  He sits there and tells you to submit everything as the pedophile in chief, the zombie in chief, the walking undead monster demon.
[15:20.000 --> 15:28.000]  Lord Joseph Biden Cecil.
[15:28.000 --> 15:29.000]  Unbelievable.
[15:29.000 --> 15:31.000]  I haven't even hit the vaccine news yet.
[15:31.000 --> 15:34.000]  There's just so much to cover.
[15:34.000 --> 15:36.000]  So much to hit.
[15:36.000 --> 15:38.000]  So much to break down today.
[15:38.000 --> 15:40.000]  I am your host Alex Jones.
[15:40.000 --> 15:41.000]  You might want to warn people about this.
[15:41.000 --> 15:42.000]  You might want to blow the whistle.
[15:42.000 --> 15:46.000]  You want to spread the links while you still can to m4wars.com and newswars.com.
[15:46.000 --> 15:50.000]  Has everybody figured it out yet?
[15:50.000 --> 15:51.000]  I was just reading their documents before they were public, before they were promoted.
[15:51.000 --> 15:53.000]  Now it's all out the open, baby.
[15:53.000 --> 15:56.000]  You're all Alex Jones now or you're all Bill Gates.
[15:56.000 --> 15:58.000]  Choose a side.
[15:58.000 --> 16:00.000]  You know, it's crazy to get to this point.
[16:00.000 --> 16:02.000]  It's very bittersweet.
[16:02.000 --> 16:05.000]  Everything we've talked about has happened just like we said it would.
[16:05.000 --> 16:07.000]  And now we have a lot of credibility, but I don't care about that.
[16:07.000 --> 16:09.000]  I care about beating the new world order.
[16:09.000 --> 16:11.000]  And it's because we have so much credibility.
[16:11.000 --> 16:14.000]  They can't allow us to stay on air much longer.
[16:14.000 --> 16:16.000]  I don't have time to tell you all the stuff they're doing to us.
[16:16.000 --> 16:18.000]  For a lot of reasons, I can't tell you what's going on.
[16:18.000 --> 16:20.000]  But let's just say this.
[16:20.000 --> 16:21.000]  We're going to see this through to the end.
[16:21.000 --> 16:24.000]  We're going to stay on air as long as we can.
[16:24.000 --> 16:26.000]  So please pray for us and please buy the products.
[16:26.000 --> 16:28.000]  And then m4wars.com.
[16:28.000 --> 16:29.000]  They're great products.
[16:29.000 --> 16:30.000]  Plus they fund the operation.
[16:30.000 --> 16:33.000]  So you know, unlike other products you can buy, they're still great.
[16:33.000 --> 16:34.000]  Do they fund freedom?
[16:34.000 --> 16:35.000]  No, a lot of them don't.
[16:35.000 --> 16:39.000]  These are great products that fund freedom and fund justice.
[16:39.000 --> 16:42.000]  When the whole world is waking up and looking for truth.
[16:42.000 --> 16:43.000]  That's why the globalists are censoring.
[16:43.000 --> 16:47.000]  They can't bring in all this tyranny and leave people like us on the air.
[16:47.000 --> 16:50.000]  So while you're at it, don't just financially support us and spread the word.
[16:50.000 --> 16:53.000]  Download everything we've done you can find and save it.
[16:53.000 --> 16:55.000]  Because who knows how long we're going to be on the air
[16:55.000 --> 16:58.000]  and the enemy is trying to destroy everything we ever said.
[16:58.000 --> 17:01.000]  As you know, we're always upping our game at m4wars.
[17:01.000 --> 17:04.000]  And we brought you a new supplement, a new product that we know you're going to love,
[17:04.000 --> 17:06.000]  especially if you have trouble sleeping.
[17:06.000 --> 17:07.000]  It is down and out.
[17:07.000 --> 17:09.000]  We don't mean bankrupt under a bridge.
[17:09.000 --> 17:12.000]  We mean down in your bed, sleeping hard throughout the night.
[17:12.000 --> 17:15.000]  It's got four milligrams of high quality melatonin.
[17:15.000 --> 17:18.000]  It's got 25 milligrams of passion flower.
[17:18.000 --> 17:21.000]  It's got 50 milligrams of Valerian root extract concentrate.
[17:21.000 --> 17:26.000]  It's got 100 milligrams of lemon balm and 150 milligrams of German chamomile.
[17:26.000 --> 17:29.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is a very strong formula.
[17:29.000 --> 17:32.000]  I recommend you only take a quarter or a half the first time.
[17:32.000 --> 17:34.000]  It's liquid, so it goes right to your body fast.
[17:34.000 --> 17:38.000]  If you take it sublingually under the tongue, oh, how about blasting off the sleep?
[17:38.000 --> 17:39.000]  It's incredible.
[17:39.000 --> 17:41.000]  It's basically a liquid formula of rocket rest.
[17:41.000 --> 17:44.000]  It's so popular we can't keep it in stock.
[17:44.000 --> 17:47.000]  Get yours today down and out exclusively at m4wars.com.

[17:51.000 --> 18:19.000]  Down and out at m4wars.com.
[18:19.000 --> 18:26.000]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[18:26.000 --> 18:28.000]  I am your host, Alex Jones.
[18:28.000 --> 18:32.000]  And this is the broadcast that David Rockefeller hated while he was alive.
[18:32.000 --> 18:40.000]  It's the broadcast that Ted Turner and Bill Gates and Oprah Winfrey and all the eugenicists, Nazis, all the racemakers cannot stand.
[18:40.000 --> 18:42.000]  We are on air thanks to you.
[18:42.000 --> 18:44.000]  And I'm very, very thankful.
[18:44.000 --> 18:55.000]  Next segment, I'm going to hit the science, the facts, the breaking news, directly linking the mRNA vaccines to turning off your cells so that they develop cancer.
[18:55.000 --> 19:00.000]  And that's why you notice they tell you, hey, you get lumps all over your body, lumps in your uterus, your lymph nodes get really, really sick.
[19:00.000 --> 19:02.000]  When you take this, don't worry about it.
[19:02.000 --> 19:09.000]  You don't have cancer because normally a doctor would tell you you had lymphatic cancer with the symptoms that you get.
[19:09.000 --> 19:16.000]  Well, we happen to have major scientific institutes and universities saying that this actually is giving you cancer.
[19:16.000 --> 19:18.000]  And you're like, why would they do this?
[19:18.000 --> 19:19.000]  Well, they've got to get rid of this.
[19:19.000 --> 19:21.000]  They've been testing so far.
[19:21.000 --> 19:24.000]  They don't just shoot up poor people and black people and third world people.
[19:24.000 --> 19:29.000]  They want to kill everybody, but they want to kill you in a year, six years, 10 years.
[19:29.000 --> 19:30.000]  Every person is different.
[19:30.000 --> 19:33.000]  And then they'll just claim it's something else causing it.
[19:33.000 --> 19:39.000]  It's called a soft kill weapon, silent weapons for quiet wars.
[19:39.000 --> 19:42.000]  There's Pentagon papers on that if you'd like to go look that up.
[19:42.000 --> 19:49.000]  But here's the Wall Street Journal last year looking forward to the end of humanity, saying humanity will be exterminated.
[19:49.000 --> 19:52.000]  It is a wonderful, good, loving thing.
[19:52.000 --> 20:02.000]  And again, today it's in Politico celebrating that we will have no more children by 2045 unless they're genetically engineered and just saying it's so good.
[20:02.000 --> 20:07.000]  And the chemicals are making the boys all effeminate and that the girls are getting cancer.
[20:07.000 --> 20:09.000]  And it's just fun and it's good because we're all bad.
[20:09.000 --> 20:12.000]  OK, so we're going to be getting into all of that.
[20:12.000 --> 20:16.000]  But let me read you this first.
[20:16.000 --> 20:18.000]  I meant to cover this yesterday.
[20:18.000 --> 20:23.000]  And since I didn't cover it, I said, well, let me just send it to a bunch of national talk show hosts I like.
[20:23.000 --> 20:26.000]  And I sent it off to some folks and I got some good responses back.
[20:26.000 --> 20:29.000]  And they said, yeah, we're going to definitely look into this and use this.
[20:29.000 --> 20:33.000]  And so one great talk show said, I'm going to steal this from you.
[20:33.000 --> 20:35.000]  And so we can't steal it from me because it's the truth.
[20:35.000 --> 20:37.000]  And I didn't write it.
[20:37.000 --> 20:46.000]  Irishman 1776 did in the video I did Sunday about Marvelous Marvin Hagler dying, his organs liquefying.
[20:46.000 --> 20:53.000]  Sadly, one day after he took the mRNA vaccine, similar to what happened to Hank Aaron.
[20:53.000 --> 20:58.000]  So if we can put up the live show feed name of the broadcast today, well, we'll go to that in a moment.
[20:58.000 --> 21:02.000]  It's on info wars.com, the live show feed.
[21:02.000 --> 21:03.000]  There it is.
[21:03.000 --> 21:09.000]  Politico celebrates end of humanity, total sterilization by 2045.
[21:09.000 --> 21:11.000]  Wow, that's quite a headline.
[21:11.000 --> 21:16.000]  Top scientists directly link mRNA vaccines to infertility and women.
[21:16.000 --> 21:17.000]  Of course, we should add cancer.
[21:17.000 --> 21:22.000]  Also top vaccine scientists warns world to hold all COVID vaccines immediately.
[21:22.000 --> 21:26.000]  Or uncontrollable monster quote will be unleashed.
[21:26.000 --> 21:31.000]  Now, let's go ahead and read what Irishman 1776 said.
[21:31.000 --> 21:37.000]  And the reason I put the headline of the show up is we're going to add what the Irishman 1776 said.
[21:37.000 --> 21:38.000]  And you can read this.
[21:38.000 --> 21:39.000]  It's all true.
[21:39.000 --> 21:40.000]  This is all public information.
[21:40.000 --> 21:42.000]  It's prima facie on its face.
[21:42.000 --> 21:51.000]  And we're going to post what he said in the live show feed of the broadcast today where Politico is celebrating the end of humanity.
[21:51.000 --> 21:55.000]  So you can share this because a lot of the crew saw this this morning and said, you know,
[21:55.000 --> 21:57.000]  I'm going to give this to my family.
[21:57.000 --> 22:03.000]  What would happen if you went to m4wars.com and copied it, put it in email and told other people to share it and pay it forward.
[22:03.000 --> 22:09.000]  We might actually turn around this globalist extermination operation, which again, they claims to save the earth.
[22:09.000 --> 22:13.000]  The truth is they want to take the earth over, play God, merge the machines.
[22:13.000 --> 22:18.000]  If we continue to move forward, we will develop technologies we have that are clean and good will go interstellar.
[22:18.000 --> 22:20.000]  They're trying to stop that.
[22:20.000 --> 22:25.000]  But let's read what the Irishman 1776 said.
[22:25.000 --> 22:30.000]  Here are 12 important questions and answers before considering getting vaccinated.
[22:30.000 --> 22:34.000]  If I get vaccinated, can I stop wearing a mask government?
[22:34.000 --> 22:36.000]  No, that's all true.
[22:36.000 --> 22:44.000]  If I get vaccinated, will the restaurants, bars, schools, fitness clubs, hair salons accept reopen and will people be able to get back to work like normal government?
[22:44.000 --> 22:45.000]  No.
[22:45.000 --> 22:51.000]  If I get vaccinated, will I be resistant to COVID government?
[22:51.000 --> 22:54.000]  Maybe we don't know exactly, but probably not.
[22:54.000 --> 22:58.000]  If I get vaccinated, at least I won't be contagious to others, right?
[22:58.000 --> 23:01.000]  Government. No, the vaccine doesn't stop transmission.
[23:01.000 --> 23:04.000]  If I get vaccinated, how long will the vaccine last?
[23:04.000 --> 23:05.000]  Government.
[23:05.000 --> 23:08.000]  No one knows all COVID vaccines are still in the experimental stage.
[23:08.000 --> 23:09.000]  Yeah.
[23:09.000 --> 23:12.000]  Pfizer just published to its shareholders that it's never going to work.
[23:12.000 --> 23:15.000]  You'll get five shots a year as Gates said last year.
[23:15.000 --> 23:16.000]  It's all planned.
[23:16.000 --> 23:18.000]  They're just rolling it out now.
[23:18.000 --> 23:21.000]  And that it's a common cold so they can never defeat it, which is great.
[23:21.000 --> 23:22.000]  It's an enemy they can't ever stop.
[23:22.000 --> 23:24.000]  It's an endless war on you.
[23:24.000 --> 23:27.000]  If I get vaccinated, can I stop social distancing?
[23:27.000 --> 23:28.000]  Government. No.
[23:28.000 --> 23:32.000]  If my parents, grandparents and myself all get vaccinated, can we hug each other again?
[23:32.000 --> 23:33.000]  Government. No.
[23:33.000 --> 23:35.000]  So what's the benefit of getting vaccinated?
[23:35.000 --> 23:36.000]  Government.
[23:36.000 --> 23:38.000]  Hoping that the virus won't kill you.
[23:38.000 --> 23:41.000]  Are you sure the vaccine won't injure or kill me?
[23:41.000 --> 23:42.000]  Government.
[23:42.000 --> 23:43.000]  No.
[23:43.000 --> 23:50.000]  If statistically the virus won't kill me, 99.7% survival rate, why should I get vaccinated?
[23:50.000 --> 23:51.000]  Government.
[23:51.000 --> 23:52.000]  To protect others.
[23:52.000 --> 23:56.000]  So if I get vaccinated, I can protect 100% of people I come in contact with.
[23:56.000 --> 23:57.000]  No.
[23:57.000 --> 24:01.000]  By the way, it's way lower than 99.7.
[24:01.000 --> 24:05.000]  That's if you actually contract it and got it, which only 1 to 1% even get it.
[24:05.000 --> 24:07.000]  Then you have a 99.7% survival rate.
[24:07.000 --> 24:09.000]  Understand it's even lower than that.
[24:09.000 --> 24:13.000]  So if I get vaccinated, can I protect 100% of people I come in contact with?
[24:13.000 --> 24:14.000]  Government.
[24:14.000 --> 24:15.000]  No.
[24:15.000 --> 24:19.000]  If I experience a severe adverse reaction, long-term effects still unknown, or die from
[24:19.000 --> 24:23.000]  the vaccine, will I or my family be compensated from the government vaccine manufacturer or
[24:23.000 --> 24:25.000]  the government?
[24:25.000 --> 24:26.000]  Government.
[24:26.000 --> 24:27.000]  No.
[24:27.000 --> 24:30.000]  The government and vaccine manufacturers have 100% zero liability regarding this experimental
[24:30.000 --> 24:31.000]  drug they gave it to themselves.
[24:31.000 --> 24:37.000]  So to summarize, the government controlled, globalist push, COVID-19 vaccine does not
[24:37.000 --> 24:42.000]  provide immunity, does not eliminate the virus, does not prevent death, does not guarantee
[24:42.000 --> 24:47.300]  you won't get it, does not stop you from passing on to others, does not eliminate the need for
[24:47.300 --> 24:51.500]  travel bans, does not eliminate the need for business closures, and does not eliminate
[24:51.500 --> 24:53.000]  the need for lockdowns.
[24:53.000 --> 24:58.100]  It is a total, gigantic, complete, galactic fraud.
[24:58.100 --> 24:59.100]  And there it is.
[24:59.100 --> 25:03.300]  We'll take this live segment later and add it to the page at band.video and the live
[25:03.300 --> 25:08.160]  show feed so you can share this video of the breakdown, but I suggest you just share the
[25:08.160 --> 25:14.800]  text of it now at infowars.com and newswars.com in the live show feed with everyone you know
[25:14.800 --> 25:17.800]  and this live link, or roll over and die.

[26:46.880 --> 26:50.400]  the public plan to murder you and your family now all public everything I told you now
[26:50.400 --> 26:57.240]  completely public stay with us.
[26:57.240 --> 27:03.040]  I'm not going to sit here and waste your time or my time and rattle off the successes info
[27:03.040 --> 27:08.400]  versus that if you're paying attention, you know, we've done together, but I'll tell you
[27:08.400 --> 27:16.080]  this, the technocrats are really upping their game and they are trying to destroy all independent
[27:16.080 --> 27:20.320]  forms of media, they're trying to shutter and silence human resistance.
[27:20.320 --> 27:25.760]  So now is the time to understand that everything we've talked about has been proven accurate
[27:25.760 --> 27:29.040]  and everything you warned your friends and family about it's about to be true.
[27:29.040 --> 27:34.080]  So it's now that your credibility is way up, the power structures of the silence, those
[27:34.080 --> 27:40.800]  of us that they can't look up to all of us to not let them silence any of us.
[27:40.800 --> 27:46.840]  We have the power, but the sun is setting on humanity and setting on free speech.
[27:46.840 --> 27:51.280]  We have to make sure that we find hard right now to make sure that a long dark night doesn't
[27:51.280 --> 27:52.280]  come.
[27:52.280 --> 27:58.440]  So be the polar bearer as you are.
[27:58.440 --> 28:05.400]  As negative as times are right now and as depressing as things can be, you have to understand
[28:05.400 --> 28:12.720]  that this is all a test, this experience, this life on this planet is a reckoning.
[28:12.720 --> 28:18.000]  It's God giving us a chance to work things out in the third dimension so we can decide
[28:18.000 --> 28:22.280]  where we want to spend eternity and what level we want to go to and it really does come
[28:22.280 --> 28:23.280]  down to that.
[28:23.280 --> 28:27.360]  So as sad as things are and as evil as things are, look at all the good in the world as
[28:27.360 --> 28:31.600]  well and realize that God is the author of our consciousness.
[28:31.600 --> 28:35.200]  God is the author of us having our own will.
[28:35.200 --> 28:40.800]  God is the author of us having free will and that free will is a beautiful thing.
[28:40.800 --> 28:45.200]  When you look at mainstream media in Hollywood and this whole evil culture in Washington,
[28:45.200 --> 28:50.360]  D.C. and Fauci and the mass cult, it's all about dominating your free will.
[28:50.360 --> 28:54.040]  It's all about telling you you're dirty, you're ugly, you're in the bad because Satan
[28:54.040 --> 28:57.920]  hates you because you're made in the image of God, the creator of the universe.
[28:57.920 --> 29:03.240]  I've been thinking a lot lately about playing devil's advocate on air, about looking at
[29:03.240 --> 29:07.240]  the world from the perspective of the globalists, that the public is so dumbed down that they
[29:07.240 --> 29:10.400]  don't care that we're stealing their future from them, that we're poisoning them, that
[29:10.400 --> 29:13.680]  we're sterilizing them, that they deserve to be killed.
[29:13.680 --> 29:16.120]  Yes, that's the position of the globalists.
[29:16.120 --> 29:20.920]  They play God and they think because we don't stand up, they have a right to do this to
[29:20.920 --> 29:21.920]  us.
[29:21.920 --> 29:25.120]  You know, I've told you that the globalists have tried to hire me, they've tried to get
[29:25.120 --> 29:30.360]  me to join them, but metaphysically at a spiritual level, I have the whole of spirit.
[29:30.360 --> 29:34.240]  I'm the connection of God, and I know that God does not like that, so I cannot join
[29:34.240 --> 29:35.240]  the enemy.
[29:35.240 --> 29:39.880]  But I'll tell you, at a selfish level, I get very, very mad at people that go along
[29:39.880 --> 29:43.880]  with the system, believing you're part of it or believing you're getting power over
[29:43.880 --> 29:44.880]  it.
[29:44.880 --> 29:50.240]  Whether you're just a steelworker or a schoolteacher or a Henry Kissinger, you're not God.
[29:50.240 --> 29:54.800]  And treating other people like they're animals and you're God is something that the real
[29:54.800 --> 29:56.600]  God of the universe doesn't like.
[29:56.600 --> 29:57.600]  And that's a fact.
[29:57.600 --> 30:00.680]  I actually bought this at Blocks, UHF Frequency.
[30:00.680 --> 30:06.800]  Snowden and others taught us how mobile phones are constantly spying on us, not just tracking
[30:06.800 --> 30:13.880]  and recording our GPS location, but recording audio and video as well, with or without a
[30:13.880 --> 30:14.880]  battery.
[30:14.880 --> 30:21.240]  Now, with the InfoWars privacy pouch, you can go dark wherever you choose.
[30:21.240 --> 30:22.240]  Excellent.
[30:22.240 --> 30:29.480]  Now, I have my own compact Faraday cage I can take wherever I want, and you can too
[30:29.480 --> 30:32.760]  at infowarstore.com.
[30:32.760 --> 30:40.000]  Government agencies, identity thieves, tech giants, and now contact tracers are all tracking
[30:40.000 --> 30:43.160]  your every move through your mobile phone.
[30:43.160 --> 30:48.480]  Now you can have the power to easily cut them off and go dark.
[30:48.480 --> 31:01.200]  The InfoWars, and get your InfoWars privacy pouch today, InfoWarsstore.com.
[31:01.200 --> 31:19.600]  Start listening to the Alex Jones show.
[31:19.600 --> 31:37.400]  I mean, you know, just drunk is blah, but still stumbling forward more blood as he falls
[31:37.400 --> 31:49.200]  down they go, our God must be lifted back up.
[31:49.200 --> 31:54.280]  Now the baby parts arrest the reporters that expose the keeping babies alive, eat the hospitals
[31:54.280 --> 32:00.560]  with their bodies, have the Pepsi taste testing systems be based on fetal tissue, all demonic
[32:00.560 --> 32:09.160]  systems, genetically engineer all the crops, overthrow creation, more blood.
[32:09.160 --> 32:19.040]  That's a good old Alex Jones channeling the spirit of the world, and dial right into
[32:19.040 --> 32:21.920]  it.
[32:21.920 --> 32:22.920]  You can too.
[32:22.920 --> 32:27.760]  While you've got to have God and the Holy Spirit to block it, and that's why so many
[32:27.760 --> 32:30.640]  people are now resonating with just that.
[32:30.640 --> 32:32.880]  Energy destroy and kill and overthrow creation.
[32:32.880 --> 32:37.920]  I'm going to break more of it down as Politico and everybody announces the end of humanity
[32:37.920 --> 32:42.880]  and they celebrate no more children within the next two decades, three decades, and you're
[32:42.880 --> 32:44.680]  like why are they saying this all openly?
[32:44.680 --> 32:46.240]  Why are they attacking our children?
[32:46.240 --> 32:48.040]  Why are they so satanic?
[32:48.040 --> 32:49.640]  Because they're dialed into the transmission.
[32:49.640 --> 32:57.120]  Now here is a report I did, or a group of reports, 11 years ago in 2010, laying out the
[32:57.120 --> 33:03.960]  Rockefeller Foundation plan to sterilize you through vaccines, which they said they would
[33:03.960 --> 33:08.720]  claim were antiviral and anti-cancer.
[33:08.720 --> 33:11.720]  Here it is.
[33:11.720 --> 33:16.520]  And it's 1968 yearly report the Rockefeller Foundation acknowledged funding the development
[33:16.520 --> 33:23.240]  of so-called anti-fertility vaccines and implementation of mass scale from page 51 onward we read.
[33:23.240 --> 33:29.160]  And remember, one of Bill Gates's uncles, Bill Gates's dad headed up Planned Parenthood,
[33:29.160 --> 33:34.120]  they worked for the Rockefellers, we've confirmed that.
[33:34.120 --> 33:38.840]  And this hundred plus billion that these 40 billionaires have put in, 38 billion from
[33:38.840 --> 33:44.920]  the Gates's, 38 billion from Buffett, some more billions added by these other billionaires,
[33:44.920 --> 33:50.080]  the Rockefeller Foundation is running this, and remember the times of London headline,
[33:50.080 --> 33:56.240]  billionaires meet in secret to plan population control, population reduction.
[33:56.240 --> 34:01.000]  And at the end of the article it talks about a world government to carry this out.
[34:01.000 --> 34:03.320]  What does ecoscience cover?
[34:03.320 --> 34:09.000]  And it says several types of drugs are known to diminish male fertility, but those have
[34:09.000 --> 34:14.400]  been tested, have serious problems with toxicity, yeah, bisphenol A.
[34:14.400 --> 34:20.320]  Rockefeller Foundation developed vaccines for mass scale fertility reduction.
[34:20.320 --> 34:24.400]  Now the media is going to tell you how much they love you and how they love your La Infasora
[34:24.400 --> 34:27.360]  and your La Reconquista.
[34:27.360 --> 34:31.640]  It's just because they want to destroy the United States and drive down the wages.
[34:31.640 --> 34:35.040]  Do you actually want to read about how they want to kill you?
[34:35.040 --> 34:39.840]  Maybe some of you do, maybe some of you don't, maybe it feels too good to be murdered slowly
[34:39.840 --> 34:40.840]  by the globalist.
[34:40.840 --> 34:45.640]  Okay, don't say you weren't warned.
[34:45.640 --> 34:49.000]  They go on to say using vaccines to reduce male fertility was something that needed to
[34:49.000 --> 34:53.720]  be investigated further according to Rockefeller Foundation, because both the oral pill and
[34:53.720 --> 34:59.320]  the IUD were not sustainable for mass scale distribution, and of course they want to do
[34:59.320 --> 35:00.320]  it by stealth.
[35:00.320 --> 35:05.640]  Oh, get your flu shot, oh, you know, half of you'll never have kids, the other halves
[35:05.640 --> 35:06.640]  will have reduced.
[35:06.640 --> 35:11.920]  See, it's got to be soft kill, it can't hit everybody, or it'd be too noticeable.
[35:11.920 --> 35:14.600]  But they're testing how much they can get away with right now.
[35:14.600 --> 35:19.160]  We are faced with the danger within the next few years, these two modern methods for which
[35:19.160 --> 35:24.480]  such high hopes have been held will in fact turn out to be impractical on a mass scale.
[35:24.480 --> 35:29.000]  The possibility of administering hormone preparations or reduced fertility was also mentioned, although
[35:29.000 --> 35:33.320]  states the report they have been known to cause bleeding problems which may limit their
[35:33.320 --> 35:34.320]  usefulness.
[35:34.320 --> 35:43.200]  Let me tell you how bad it is, a simpler management or renewable subcutaneous implant of these
[35:43.200 --> 35:47.320]  hormones has been suggested, but whether or not the same difficulties would result has
[35:47.320 --> 35:48.320]  not been determined.
[35:48.320 --> 35:51.760]  And remember they deployed all of this later.
[35:51.760 --> 35:57.080]  Saying that research thus far has been too low grade to produce any sustainable results,
[35:57.080 --> 36:00.560]  the report was adamant.
[36:00.560 --> 36:05.720]  The foundation will never to assist in filling this important gap in several ways, seeking
[36:05.720 --> 36:10.360]  out and encouraging the development of and providing partial support to a few centers
[36:10.360 --> 36:14.920]  of excellence in universities and research institutes in the United States and abroad
[36:14.920 --> 36:19.680]  in which the methods and points of view of molecular biology are teamed with the more
[36:19.680 --> 36:26.400]  traditional approaches of embryology, endocrinology and research pertinent to the development
[36:26.400 --> 36:31.160]  of fertility control methods.
[36:31.160 --> 36:35.000]  They want to hit those babies in the womb, kind of like the U.N. programs worldwide where
[36:35.000 --> 36:39.640]  they only want to help the pregnant women, they come give them shots, and they all...
[36:39.640 --> 36:43.680]  Well there you go, it goes on and on and on and on, they tried to expose all this off
[36:43.680 --> 36:48.020]  the internet, but now they failed as everyone is searching their hard drives, searching
[36:48.020 --> 36:53.040]  their computers, going to President Planet.tv that has the whole archive for free and digging
[36:53.040 --> 36:55.600]  into it and sharing it with the world.
[36:55.600 --> 37:01.000]  As we go through their own documents, you have State Department random 200 where Kissinger
[37:01.000 --> 37:06.600]  said we got to kill the third world as well using chemicals in the water.
[37:06.600 --> 37:13.880]  But here we are in the year 2021 and they use genetically engineered vaccines to go
[37:13.880 --> 37:20.880]  in and turn off the gene that suppresses tumors and then you get cancer.
[37:20.880 --> 37:26.480]  They then go in and set the body to attack the protein that's in the placenta, so the
[37:26.480 --> 37:35.640]  baby never comes to term and it goes on and on and on and on over and over and over and
[37:35.640 --> 37:39.120]  over and over again.
[37:39.120 --> 37:41.840]  So a lot of people ask, Jones, why do you get so mad?
[37:41.840 --> 37:43.200]  Sometimes Jones, why do you drink too much?
[37:43.200 --> 37:47.760]  So I'll go months not drinking, months drinking, it's because this gets to me, folks.
[37:47.760 --> 37:51.720]  I mean, you think I think I'm happy about all this, you think it's fun to be right about
[37:51.720 --> 37:52.720]  all this?
[37:52.720 --> 37:56.520]  You think it's fun to be the target when you've been exposing it, number one?
[37:56.520 --> 38:03.120]  And then the frustration of watching people go around like sheep, buying into all of this.
[38:03.120 --> 38:05.680]  You think the Texas governor is in on this?
[38:05.680 --> 38:06.680]  No.
[38:06.680 --> 38:08.040]  You think Joe Biden is even in on this?
[38:08.040 --> 38:09.040]  No.
[38:09.040 --> 38:10.040]  Joe Biden does what he's told.
[38:10.040 --> 38:14.440]  It's the Rockefellers, it's the Rothschild, it's the globalist and Bill Gates works directly
[38:14.440 --> 38:23.560]  under the Rockefeller Brothers Foundation, Operation Lockstep, was Event 201, was Operation
[38:23.560 --> 38:26.600]  Crimson Contagion, which I will cover tomorrow.
[38:26.600 --> 38:31.000]  It's just so complex and so important, I procrastinated on it because I wanted to read hundreds of
[38:31.000 --> 38:35.440]  pages of stuff on it and I've gone over it, but guys, give me the folder on Crimson Contagion,
[38:35.440 --> 38:38.760]  I want to make sure that we hit that tomorrow because that's so critical.
[38:38.760 --> 38:43.520]  And I'm going to open the phones up for much of the show tomorrow for medical workers to
[38:43.520 --> 38:46.240]  call in, unfiltered and tell us what you see happening with the COVID vaccine.
[38:46.240 --> 38:47.240]  Oh, first call.
[38:47.240 --> 38:51.840]  I'm a medical doctor, 22 of my patients died in Virginia.
[38:51.840 --> 38:54.560]  It's not just him saying that, I've got all the articles right here.
[38:54.560 --> 38:59.520]  This is conditioning us to accept mass death.
[38:59.520 --> 39:03.640]  And so there's the Rockefellers in the 60s going, we need to sterilize people.
[39:03.640 --> 39:09.080]  Well, now they've learned fertility is so strong, unless you remove the sexual organs,
[39:09.080 --> 39:11.920]  it's best just to kill people.
[39:11.920 --> 39:15.440]  There's what presents you before he died, gave that speech to CFR in Canada, there's
[39:15.440 --> 39:22.720]  CFR and said, it is now much easier instead of propagandizing a million people to kill
[39:22.720 --> 39:24.640]  a million people.
[39:24.640 --> 39:30.480]  We have passed the point of being able to convince them, now is the time to kill them.
[39:30.480 --> 39:35.640]  His daughter is married to Psycho Joe, he's not being found with dead interns, their brains
[39:35.640 --> 39:39.160]  bashed out, he's up there calling for forced inoculations.
[39:39.160 --> 39:41.560]  Know your enemy.
[39:41.560 --> 39:45.200]  You know, I just quoted him, he'll look it up.
[39:45.200 --> 39:47.800]  It is time to move forward against them.
[39:47.800 --> 39:52.040]  There is no convincing them now, it is easier to kill them.
[39:52.040 --> 39:59.400]  When he goes on, it will be good to convince them, you will not win this fight.
[39:59.400 --> 40:01.160]  Only killing them will work now.
[40:01.160 --> 40:05.400]  And we're just supposed to go, oh, okay.
[40:05.400 --> 40:15.280]  I have like the Washington Post, Wall Street Journal, New York Times.
[40:15.280 --> 40:16.280]  They all call me up.
[40:16.280 --> 40:18.560]  They go, what do you mean?
[40:18.560 --> 40:19.560]  This is violent.
[40:19.560 --> 40:24.000]  The vaccines, people have a right to defend themselves against an overt offensive assault.
[40:24.000 --> 40:25.520]  Are you calling for people to be violent?
[40:25.520 --> 40:27.640]  I'm like, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[40:27.640 --> 40:31.560]  I think we should be given experimental vaccines and forced to do it and watch people die in
[40:31.560 --> 40:32.560]  mass.
[40:32.560 --> 40:33.560]  I'm glad Hank Aaron's dead.
[40:33.560 --> 40:35.240]  I'm glad Marvellous Marvin Hagler's dead.
[40:35.240 --> 40:38.920]  I'm glad nursing homes up to 10% of the people are dead from it.
[40:38.920 --> 40:39.920]  It's wonderful.
[40:39.920 --> 40:40.920]  You're good people.
[40:40.920 --> 40:41.920]  Hell, what gets you right here?
[40:41.920 --> 40:45.320]  Telling us you're killing us in the Wall Street Journal and Politico.
[40:45.320 --> 40:46.320]  Thank you.
[40:46.320 --> 40:53.240]  No, I think, I think, I think Bill Gates has the right to kill every damn one of us.
[40:53.240 --> 40:57.800]  Anybody that stands in his way should be killed by the FBI.
[40:57.800 --> 41:00.880]  Humanity has been domesticated by and large.
[41:00.880 --> 41:05.440]  The population has been trained to submit, do what you're told, and it's all going to
[41:05.440 --> 41:06.440]  pass.
[41:06.440 --> 41:09.280]  But if you study authoritarians, if you study the globalists, you understand that they reach
[41:09.280 --> 41:13.480]  a point where all the training is just beta and you go into the point of being cold, being
[41:13.480 --> 41:14.680]  totally enslaved.
[41:14.680 --> 41:18.240]  And because the globalists see us as weak and see us as stupid, they are now making
[41:18.240 --> 41:19.240]  that move.
[41:19.240 --> 41:23.240]  And they are collapsing the third world with their economic weapons to then flood us with
[41:23.240 --> 41:28.920]  the third world that the UN will use as a weapon to then have us under such a crisis,
[41:28.920 --> 41:33.880]  under such a load, capitulate to the UN, whatever agreements they want us to sign, hoping that
[41:33.880 --> 41:39.520]  they will stop the flood of tens of millions of refugees, not fleeing COVID or climate
[41:39.520 --> 41:44.120]  change, as the UN and Klaus Schwab were saying, and Bill Gates was saying, but fleeing the
[41:44.120 --> 41:50.120]  year-long lockdowns that the UN and Bill Gates ordered them to institute or they wouldn't
[41:50.120 --> 41:53.080]  get more IMF and World Bank money.
[41:53.080 --> 41:56.880]  And that's why we have to really get educated about the globalists.
[41:56.880 --> 42:02.600]  The New World Order is a planetary corporate plan for world government.
[42:02.600 --> 42:05.920]  But world government is only the control grid.
[42:05.920 --> 42:11.840]  Now, inner members of the cult are told that they are going to transcend and become gods
[42:11.840 --> 42:12.840]  and attain immortality.
[42:12.840 --> 42:19.040]  But the price for that is to carry out the orderly extermination of all carbon-based
[42:19.040 --> 42:20.040]  line forms.
[42:20.040 --> 42:22.640]  That's why they say carbon is bad.
[42:22.640 --> 42:26.360]  They are rewriting the entire genetic code of the planet.
[42:26.360 --> 42:28.240]  They are playing God.
[42:28.240 --> 42:35.000]  They believe they have been inspired by interdimensional entities that are giving them advanced technology
[42:35.000 --> 42:38.000]  to carry out this transformation.
[42:38.000 --> 42:42.440]  I know this sounds insane, but if you read the writings of the globalists, it's all on
[42:42.440 --> 42:43.440]  record.
[42:43.440 --> 42:45.880]  You have been warned.
[42:45.880 --> 42:50.360]  You have been given the information to say no to this plan.
[42:50.360 --> 42:54.000]  This is the end of all life on Earth as we know it.
[42:54.000 --> 42:58.560]  This is the alien takeover of Earth.
[42:58.560 --> 43:00.640]  I knew Trump was in battle.
[43:00.640 --> 43:07.160]  I knew he was surrounded by cowards and by double-talking agents of the enemy.
[43:07.160 --> 43:10.000]  And a lot of people just couldn't believe it.
[43:10.000 --> 43:14.240]  They're like, oh no, it's 3G chess, 5G chess, he's invincible.
[43:14.240 --> 43:17.040]  And I understand why people aren't to believe that, because this is scaring what's going
[43:17.040 --> 43:19.040]  on with global government in the New World Order.
[43:19.040 --> 43:22.560]  And now that people woke up to the fact that's real, they won't somebody to come save them
[43:22.560 --> 43:23.560]  from.
[43:23.560 --> 43:24.560]  Trump sure has held track.
[43:24.560 --> 43:29.360]  My gosh, look at how prescription drug prices just tripled for quadruple, depending on the
[43:29.360 --> 43:31.720]  drug once you buy it and sign that executive order.
[43:31.720 --> 43:36.240]  We pay the most of anybody in the world, that's just one case of hundreds of things that
[43:36.240 --> 43:37.240]  Trump had reversed.
[43:37.240 --> 43:41.000]  And now people are going to feel the sting and the pain, the energy cost, everything
[43:41.000 --> 43:42.000]  else.
[43:42.000 --> 43:46.160]  But what's really illustrated this is the trial to the Senate, where Trump's own lawyers
[43:46.160 --> 43:50.840]  are attacking him and putting him down and saying he lost the election and just engaged
[43:50.840 --> 43:56.120]  in all sorts of criminal activity, because the fix is in folks, the swamp is deep.
[43:56.120 --> 43:59.320]  Trump fought it, but it's up to us to win it.
[43:59.320 --> 44:04.400]  The entire New World Order system is about making you feel pathetic, making you feel
[44:04.400 --> 44:09.000]  weak, making you play the part of a victim so you don't take your birthright as being
[44:09.000 --> 44:14.840]  made the image of God and the incredible mission and destiny we have being given free will.
[44:14.840 --> 44:20.920]  Being given free will, being given consciousness is literally the seed of an entire universe,
[44:20.920 --> 44:22.920]  an entire system.
[44:22.920 --> 44:25.960]  And the fact that you're able to commune with God, the fact that you're able to see
[44:25.960 --> 44:30.360]  the beauty of the sunset, or the beauty of the waves in the ocean, or the beauty of your
[44:30.360 --> 44:35.320]  wife or your husband, or the beauty of your child learning knowledge, the beauty of music.
[44:35.320 --> 44:40.240]  The fact that you can commune with that and resonate with that is energetic, and that itself
[44:40.240 --> 44:43.600]  is what God teaches us is worship.
[44:43.600 --> 44:47.760]  But don't worship the globalist, don't worship the NFL, don't worship all the things of the
[44:47.760 --> 44:53.680]  system, but worship the things of God, because we're made by God, and appreciate your consciousness,
[44:53.680 --> 45:01.200]  and appreciate free speech while you still have it, while you still have it.
[45:01.200 --> 45:26.960]  We are listening to the Alex Jones show.
[45:26.960 --> 45:32.240]  We are back live, and we're not going to die in the ditch on our knees licking globalist
[45:32.240 --> 45:33.240]  boots.
[45:33.240 --> 45:39.600]  We're going to win and fight on our feet.
[45:39.600 --> 45:41.520]  What a time to be alive.
[45:41.520 --> 45:48.280]  The enemy's gone from beta to their attack, and I'm very proud of the Alex Jones broadcast,
[45:48.280 --> 45:51.960]  which isn't just Alex Jones, it's this great crew, it's our affiliates, it's our sponsors,
[45:51.960 --> 45:57.000]  it's the listeners, it's the people that pray for this transmission.
[45:57.000 --> 46:00.600]  So I mentioned all of this, and if you think I'm kidding, you got to go read it for yourself.
[46:00.600 --> 46:03.800]  There's a whole bunch of news articles out today that dovetail the ones that came out
[46:03.800 --> 46:10.320]  last year in establishment publications, and when you look at who Elaine Shadart is, and
[46:10.320 --> 46:15.440]  when you look at who Adam Kersh is, all these people are globalists.
[46:15.440 --> 46:19.080]  It's like the guy that had the big article in the NBC News saying, we'll get rid of all
[46:19.080 --> 46:25.200]  humans by law, marginal machines, humans are evil, well, he's a top globalist that wants
[46:25.200 --> 46:31.040]  to depopulate people as well, so it's all the same crew creating with dystopia, making
[46:31.040 --> 46:36.000]  you as depressed as possible, it's their main mission, and then saying, we're looking forward
[46:36.000 --> 46:42.040]  to the end of humanity, but here's the latest out of Politico, no more babies, the hormone
[46:42.040 --> 46:48.400]  altering chemicals threatening human procreation, and they go, oh gosh, they're on our side,
[46:48.400 --> 46:54.400]  we'll wait till you read more, sperm counts are set to reach zero in 2045, leading scholar
[46:54.400 --> 46:59.720]  Shana Sean says, there's a looming solution to all of humanity's problems, oh really,
[46:59.720 --> 47:00.720]  what's that?
[47:00.720 --> 47:08.200]  By 2045, most men, this is 20, something years from now, may no longer be able to reproduce
[47:08.200 --> 47:14.320]  because of the impact of hormone affecting chemicals that it says are sterilizing amphibian
[47:14.320 --> 47:20.760]  life, fish life, mammal life, and confusing the sexual preference, and of course the media
[47:20.760 --> 47:25.520]  is there to say, oh, your little boy has different chemicals in him, something's happened in
[47:25.520 --> 47:31.880]  utero, tell him he's a girl, and then we'll remove those genitals to make sure even though
[47:31.880 --> 47:39.400]  we reduce their fertility, and their size by 90%, we gave him that little micro penis,
[47:39.400 --> 47:45.920]  now we're going to cut it completely off, we're not mutilators, we're not mad scientists,
[47:45.920 --> 47:49.640]  just look at the deputy head of health and human services, why is a scary psycho dude
[47:49.640 --> 47:58.080]  in a wig up there on TV talking about your five-year-old's genitals, liberal, it's so
[47:58.080 --> 48:02.920]  liberal, they should have like a new hellraiser movie, but in like reality, they have real
[48:02.920 --> 48:07.120]  hellraisers, and as long as they say they're liberal, they see chopping kids up and slicing
[48:07.120 --> 48:11.600]  necks and murdering, it's just like, we're here to help you, your doctor's here, it's
[48:11.600 --> 48:19.080]  Dr. Gates, and as long as Pinhead wore a pink sweater, in fact can somebody in graphics
[48:19.080 --> 48:23.920]  put pink sweaters on the hellraiser crew of demons, as long as you put a pink sweater
[48:23.920 --> 48:28.760]  on Oprah Winfrey or Bill Gates, you don't notice what a demon head they are, just like
[48:28.760 --> 48:37.080]  a demonic black hole opening to another dimension, just wanting to rip your face off, but again,
[48:37.080 --> 48:41.960]  they're all on record wanting to depopulate the planet, but Oprah Winfrey's gonna fight
[48:41.960 --> 48:49.400]  the racism of the royals when they're the whole group directing it, let's continue
[48:49.400 --> 48:55.080]  though, yeah, just put a pink sweater on, that's all we need, and then it would be okay,
[48:55.080 --> 49:00.240]  well then you can have Pinhead babysit your children, I'm here for your children's future,
[49:00.240 --> 49:04.920]  I want the genitals, oh thank you, we'll have our children sit in your lap, you know, this
[49:04.920 --> 49:08.760]  guy isn't scary, let's show some of the drag queen story time people, much scarier than
[49:08.760 --> 49:15.520]  Pinhead, but it's okay, pink sweater, there you go, hello, yeah I want to kill everybody,
[49:15.520 --> 49:19.080]  yeah, all the scientists look at the vaccine, say it'll sterilize your Achillea, no big
[49:19.080 --> 49:27.760]  one, you have cancer, it's fine, I'm slippery, sorry, let's continue, top scientist warns
[49:27.760 --> 49:33.040]  that the world that halt all COVID-19 vaccinations immediately or uncontrollable monster will
[49:33.040 --> 49:39.120]  be unleashed, we're gonna have Mike Adams on about the top admitted scientist, Gert Vanden
[49:39.120 --> 49:44.960]  Bosch who's worked in the highest levels of university science, all of it, coming out
[49:44.960 --> 49:49.920]  in the world that this is a takeover, a mass kill program, and again, you know, here's
[49:49.920 --> 49:53.960]  Politico, here's the New York Times telling everybody's becoming sterile, that the chemicals
[49:53.960 --> 50:00.400]  are confusing, not just the genitals, but the olfactory nerve in the nose, so that male
[50:00.400 --> 50:04.880]  frogs, male men are attracted to the smell of other males, this is all chemical warfare,
[50:04.880 --> 50:12.160]  remember the Pentagon gay bomb, the plan to spray Iraqi troops with chemicals that would
[50:12.160 --> 50:16.800]  make them start having gay orgies, they found in animal studies, yes, that's how strong
[50:16.800 --> 50:20.520]  these chemicals are, just type in Pentagon plan gay bomb, you'll get BBC news, just click
[50:20.520 --> 50:27.200]  web, it's an old story, and then they had Operation Gay Sex, I'm not joking, that was
[50:27.200 --> 50:33.920]  a plan to put out ideas that Saddam and Fidel Castro were gay to quote undermine them with
[50:33.920 --> 50:42.680]  their people, here I'll show you, all you gotta do is type in Pentagon planned gay bomb,
[50:42.680 --> 50:48.280]  click news, and you'll get it, there it is, Wikipedia the gay bomb, now let's just continue,
[50:48.280 --> 50:52.760]  so and again, then they make it fashionable and trendy as you become sterile as there's
[50:52.760 --> 50:58.280]  no one left and as everyone dies, what are the sperm telling us, New York Times, scientists
[50:58.280 --> 51:05.080]  want to send 335 million seed sperm and egg samples to the moon to create a lunar Noah's
[51:05.080 --> 51:09.280]  Ark, because they're going to exterminate us all here on earth, CBS News, agricultural
[51:09.280 --> 51:15.240]  Noah's Ark doomsday seed vault in Arctic to outlast major sea level rise in permafrost
[51:15.240 --> 51:22.320]  warming, the new new deal has already arrived, thanks to COVID, world government takeover,
[51:22.320 --> 51:28.280]  and here's a big article I was mentioning, Danish Ethics Council recommends legal gender
[51:28.280 --> 51:33.040]  change for 10-year-olds that they can convince are another sex, even though they're not of
[51:33.040 --> 51:36.760]  the age of consent, well they can't have sex with them by law, they can chop their genitals
[51:36.760 --> 51:39.680]  off if they can convince them, you know, if a pervert can convince your 10-year-old to
[51:39.680 --> 51:44.040]  get in a van with them, they go to prison, but if they can be the government and send
[51:44.040 --> 51:48.560]  a high priest male dressed as a woman, that's not creepy at all, like a science fiction nightmare
[51:48.560 --> 51:54.800]  at the clown movie, no no no, then they can actually chop them off or put them on chemicals,
[51:54.800 --> 52:01.320]  see how liberal it is, US Army considers scrapping general neutral fitness tests as majority
[52:01.320 --> 52:07.840]  of women fail, oh, lowering standards, I thought women are equal, well they're certainly not
[52:07.840 --> 52:11.000]  equal when it comes to physical stamina, but men can't have babies either, but Twitter
[52:11.000 --> 52:17.440]  will ban you if you say that, or if you say 2 plus 2 equals 4, now let's continue yet
[52:17.440 --> 52:27.560]  again, in a twist, scientists find cancer drivers hiding in RNA, not DNA, Memorial Sloan
[52:27.560 --> 52:33.080]  Kettering Cancer Center, if you don't know who they are, they're one of the top four
[52:33.080 --> 52:38.080]  cancer research facilities on planet Earth, and you can read the whole article, I mean
[52:38.080 --> 52:43.600]  if you just type in mRNA, RNA, drives cancer, you'll get thousands of reports and studies,
[52:43.600 --> 52:46.600]  but this is just the one I have here, and this is done before the whole couple of things
[52:46.600 --> 52:52.280]  happening, they cannot find where DNA is causing cancer, it's actually not true, it's not malfunctions
[52:52.280 --> 52:58.440]  you could have, it is viruses getting in that are able to reprogram it giving you cancer,
[52:58.440 --> 53:03.840]  most cancer is viral, and what they call the vaccine is cancer, is a cancer virus, that's
[53:03.840 --> 53:08.800]  what it is, and I've got experts coming on that later, so when Biden says after he defeats
[53:08.800 --> 53:16.000]  COVID, he's going to defeat cancer, oh yeah, talk about in your face, again this article,
[53:16.000 --> 53:23.040]  old ways risk of COVID-vax, blood clot fears, shot banned in 20 nations, and remember they
[53:23.040 --> 53:27.960]  had oh big articles that we were full of it and we were liars and we were evil and nobody
[53:27.960 --> 53:32.840]  banned any vaccines, we were just lying to you, even though it was true what we said
[53:32.840 --> 53:40.200]  about Pfizer being banned in India, well now it's moved on to the AstraZeneca, Biden calls
[53:40.200 --> 53:45.240]  on local preachers doctors to promote vaccines, oh yes, because they're doctors now, I mean
[53:45.240 --> 53:51.200]  hell you don't need Dr. Gates to do it, now we have the preachers to do it, it's religious
[53:51.200 --> 53:58.720]  to take the mark from our new priest Joe who can barely talk Biden, Professor Warren's
[53:58.720 --> 54:05.560]  Post Corona Society is a national obedience contest, yes it's a IQ test, it's a eugenics
[54:05.560 --> 54:11.560]  test, it's an obedience dog training situation, oh wait till I hit how COVID's totally short
[54:11.560 --> 54:15.240]  our economy in China is bigger than ever and won't even ship our containers back to us
[54:15.240 --> 54:18.240]  because everybody's having to buy from China now because the whole world's locked down,
[54:18.240 --> 54:24.360]  this is just totally having China take over economically all perfectly planned with precision
[54:24.360 --> 54:28.200]  and all over the western world they're sending Stasi police into bars to see if you touch
[54:28.200 --> 54:34.480]  hands or kiss, yes this is really happening, this is not a dystopia, this is reality, oh
[54:34.480 --> 54:37.880]  but British Airways boss calls for vaccine travelers to fly without restrictions, see
[54:37.880 --> 54:43.400]  he's your doctor now, Swiss official blames future fourth wave on COVID non-vaccinated
[54:43.400 --> 54:50.600]  people but the problem is even NPR admits COVID-19 vaccines could add fuel to evolution
[54:50.600 --> 54:54.400]  of coronavirus mutations and that's what we're gonna be breaking down in the third hour with
[54:54.400 --> 54:59.280]  a special guest because they admit the literature it's actually giving rise to new super strains
[54:59.280 --> 55:04.600]  so they're using humans to incubate super strains and have the cells produce new deadly
[55:04.600 --> 55:10.520]  COVID viruses, it was a carrier you see the COVID was just a weak virus to scare everybody
[55:10.520 --> 55:14.440]  something new they could own but also based on the common cold so you could never cure
[55:14.440 --> 55:19.480]  it and then they inject you as a petri dish to breed the viruses to create proteins that
[55:19.480 --> 55:25.440]  turn off your cancer fighting systems and protein blockers that kill the placenta, devastating
[55:25.440 --> 55:32.440]  weapon, incredible feat by Lord Gates against humanity, we're gonna go to break, don't forget

[55:47.080 --> 55:52.200]  Listers ask me all the time why do you have multiple multivitamins, why do you have multiple
[55:52.200 --> 55:57.120]  high quality iodine, why do you do that because different strokes for different folks, if
[55:57.120 --> 56:01.080]  we're talking to researchers and scientists and they say hey a lot of people love deep
[56:01.080 --> 56:05.200]  birth pure crystal iodine but you should put one out with deeper crystal iodine and the

[56:56.520 --> 57:00.800]  new world order is breathing down our neck, the big globalist publications are coming

[57:24.320 --> 57:30.160]  the globalist but I can't do it if you don't support us so pray for us, word of mouth,
[57:30.160 --> 57:34.000]  tell folks about the broadcast however you can and buy great products that will enrich
[57:34.000 --> 57:40.560]  you and your family's lives everyday at infowarstore.com whether it's high quality coffee or supplements
[57:40.560 --> 57:45.560]  or books or films, all of it nurtures the soul, all of it empowers humanity, all of
[57:45.560 --> 57:52.560]  it is pro-human and pro-god, thank you so much.
[58:15.560 --> 58:24.560]  So, we've got permanent troops in the capitol, we're told by the democratic party and by
[58:24.560 --> 58:30.480]  Biden that the military is going to go after the American people with the FBI and we're
[58:30.480 --> 58:33.880]  now at the Pentagon attacking Tucker Carlson when he says, hey there, women can't pass
[58:33.880 --> 58:38.760]  the physical so they're lowering the standards and now they're going to have pregnant women
[58:38.760 --> 58:44.720]  you know flying around in the second trimester on basically combat missions, this is insane,
[58:44.720 --> 58:48.840]  China is the complete opposite of this, this is to undermine us and bring us down and they
[58:48.840 --> 58:52.720]  want him off the air, the Pentagon is responding to this, even Bill Mars admitting that Tucker
[58:52.720 --> 58:57.360]  Carlson is right about all of this but that's a day late, a dollar short so Tucker wasn't
[58:57.360 --> 59:02.960]  intimidated by the Pentagon that can only send pallets of cash to the Iranians and stuff
[59:02.960 --> 59:07.280]  like that get our troops killed so he doubled down last night as part of that report, full
[59:07.280 --> 59:10.000]  report posted at infowarstore.com.
[59:10.000 --> 59:15.360]  So it turns out when you suggest the Pentagon may be lowering the standards for troops and
[59:15.360 --> 59:21.040]  thus affecting our ability to successfully win wars for political reasons, they don't
[59:21.040 --> 59:25.440]  like it but that hasn't changed the fact that that's exactly what they're doing.
[59:25.440 --> 59:29.800]  In December the Defense Department signed off on 15 recommendations from its so-called
[59:29.800 --> 59:34.000]  Inclusion Board, those recommendations are slated to be completed by the end of this
[59:34.000 --> 59:35.640]  month, March.
[59:35.640 --> 59:39.720]  According to the Pentagon, quote, Acting Defense Secretary Chris Miller signed a memo entitled
[59:39.720 --> 59:45.040]  actions to improve racial and ethnic diversity and inclusion in the U.S. military and that
[59:45.040 --> 59:49.520]  examined the culture of the military following the murder of George Floyd in Minneapolis
[59:49.520 --> 59:56.040]  and quote, one of those recommendations was to quote, remove aptitude test barriers that
[59:56.040 --> 59:58.240]  adversely impact diversity.
[59:58.240 --> 1:00:03.040]  Separately, the Pentagon is now reportedly considering lowering fitness standards for
[1:00:03.040 --> 1:00:07.440]  female recruits, the military had adopted a gender neutral test that scored men and
[1:00:07.440 --> 1:00:12.040]  women on the same basis, the idea being they would have to fight the same wars.
[1:00:12.040 --> 1:00:16.040]  Turns out though that far more than half of the women who took the test failed it, so
[1:00:16.040 --> 1:00:18.600]  they apparently are ditching that.
[1:00:18.600 --> 1:00:25.600]  The question is, whether or not this helps diversity, will it help us win wars and defend
[1:00:25.600 --> 1:00:26.600]  the country?
[1:00:26.600 --> 1:00:30.160]  Douglas McGregor is in a good position to answer that question, he's a retired Army
[1:00:30.160 --> 1:00:32.320]  colonel, we're happy to have him on tonight.
[1:00:32.320 --> 1:00:37.480]  Douglas, thanks so much for coming on, so the military is doing these things and has
[1:00:37.480 --> 1:00:41.760]  been doing them for a long time in order to achieve political goals.
[1:00:41.760 --> 1:00:46.400]  Most of us don't see the military as a political organization, but as our last line of defense
[1:00:46.400 --> 1:00:48.120]  against hostile foreign powers.
[1:00:48.120 --> 1:00:53.240]  Do these changes make it more or less likely the Pentagon will be able to defend the country?
[1:00:53.240 --> 1:00:59.400]  Well, Tucker, I think the last 20 years have had a profoundly negative impact on the American
[1:00:59.400 --> 1:01:06.080]  military, particularly on the combat forces that have had to go through these long occupations,
[1:01:06.080 --> 1:01:13.400]  long deployments, without clear missions and attainable objectives and as a result of this,
[1:01:13.400 --> 1:01:19.400]  we've also fought a very weak enemy, an enemy without air forces, without air defenses,
[1:01:19.400 --> 1:01:25.160]  without armies and people reach erroneous conclusions about the nature of combat under
[1:01:25.160 --> 1:01:26.160]  those circumstances.
[1:01:26.160 --> 1:01:32.960]  And I think to some extent that's what's happened now, so that there's a readiness to accommodate
[1:01:32.960 --> 1:01:38.440]  PC demands from policymakers who frankly have a cocktail level of familiarity with real
[1:01:38.440 --> 1:01:44.920]  war when otherwise senior officers would put up much more serious resistance.
[1:01:44.920 --> 1:01:50.560]  So the answer to your question is I think these policies are detrimental in most cases
[1:01:50.560 --> 1:01:53.400]  and probably divisive.
[1:01:53.400 --> 1:01:57.000]  So the rest of the world is of course paying close attention to this.
[1:01:57.000 --> 1:02:01.200]  We have been the world's supreme military power for a long time.
[1:02:01.200 --> 1:02:06.600]  What is the view of our adversaries and potential adversaries of these political changes that
[1:02:06.600 --> 1:02:09.040]  we've made to our military?
[1:02:09.040 --> 1:02:14.680]  Well none of our potential opponents, whether they are in the Middle East, Northeast Asia,
[1:02:14.680 --> 1:02:17.120]  Eastern Europe, doesn't make any difference.
[1:02:17.120 --> 1:02:22.120]  None of them would even think of adopting any of these positions and policies under
[1:02:22.120 --> 1:02:23.120]  any circumstances.
[1:02:23.120 --> 1:02:27.120]  Yeah, so look, here's the bottom line, the fine print.
[1:02:27.120 --> 1:02:30.280]  Everybody knows it's about ending the human military, bringing in machines.
[1:02:30.280 --> 1:02:34.160]  This is to sabotage our military and destroy it and go to mechanized systems, the global
[1:02:34.160 --> 1:02:35.160]  control.
[1:02:35.160 --> 1:02:40.040]  All this is to sabotage, sabotage the family, sabotage the border, sabotage the dollar,
[1:02:40.040 --> 1:02:42.440]  ship in the fentanyl, destroy the country.
[1:02:42.440 --> 1:02:43.440]  That's it.
[1:02:43.440 --> 1:02:49.600]  Demoralizers have us all fought over a race war while the totally homogeneous Psycoms
[1:02:49.600 --> 1:02:51.600]  engage in giant death camps for people.
[1:02:51.600 --> 1:02:56.160]  And that's what this is.
[1:02:56.160 --> 1:02:59.280]  I sell supplements for two reasons.
[1:02:59.280 --> 1:03:04.640]  Because they work, they're real, they're powerful, and because it's a giant market.
[1:03:04.640 --> 1:03:07.280]  But again, why is there a giant market?
[1:03:07.280 --> 1:03:08.780]  Because it works.
[1:03:08.780 --> 1:03:10.720]  That's why it exponentially grows.
[1:03:10.720 --> 1:03:18.960]  So whether it's saw palm meadow and other key ingredients in our prostate formula, prostaguard,
[1:03:18.960 --> 1:03:24.320]  or whether it is the super high grade organic vitamin B12 and ultra 12, or whether it's
[1:03:24.320 --> 1:03:31.320]  the PQQ or the CoQ-10 in DNA force, or the pure deep-growth crystal iodine and X2, these
[1:03:31.320 --> 1:03:37.640]  are all the very best supplements you're going to find in an already great market of
[1:03:37.640 --> 1:03:39.440]  high quality products out there.
[1:03:39.440 --> 1:03:41.040]  And it funds the M4.
[1:03:41.040 --> 1:03:44.640]  So even if these products weren't high quality, which they are, you're fun in the M4s, you
[1:03:44.640 --> 1:03:45.640]  can't lose.
[1:03:45.640 --> 1:03:48.040]  M4s delivers in space.
[1:03:48.040 --> 1:03:50.720]  Visit m4store.com and get the products today.
[1:03:50.720 --> 1:04:18.400]  And again, I want to thank you all for keeping us on air at m4store.com.
[1:04:18.400 --> 1:04:28.880]  Well, I've known about Stu Peters for a while, and I've seen him on some of our other shows
[1:04:28.880 --> 1:04:32.080]  here on the M4s network with Owen Shroyer and Tom Papert.
[1:04:32.080 --> 1:04:35.640]  But I wanted to get him on the program because he's really knocking it out of the park on
[1:04:35.640 --> 1:04:36.640]  so many cylinders.
[1:04:36.640 --> 1:04:40.280]  And we've got the George Floyd trial going on.
[1:04:40.280 --> 1:04:43.880]  We've got the tens of millions of dollars given to his family.
[1:04:43.880 --> 1:04:48.840]  We've got millions of dollars being spent by the city to demonize the police officer
[1:04:48.840 --> 1:04:50.520]  to make sure he's convicted.
[1:04:50.520 --> 1:04:53.040]  I mean, I've never seen such a ganging up, such a piling on.
[1:04:53.040 --> 1:04:57.000]  And I don't even like what the officer did, but obviously Floyd's out of his mind dumping
[1:04:57.000 --> 1:04:58.440]  fit in a lot of his pockets.
[1:04:58.440 --> 1:05:00.320]  He's begging to be on the ground.
[1:05:00.320 --> 1:05:03.280]  Now they're admitting the autopsy probably died of a heart attack.
[1:05:03.280 --> 1:05:08.080]  But this is the total division of the media and the Democratic Party trying to cause a
[1:05:08.080 --> 1:05:09.080]  race war.
[1:05:09.080 --> 1:05:10.440]  And we've seen riots across the country again.
[1:05:10.440 --> 1:05:14.720]  We've seen burning federal buildings, but almost no coverage of it.
[1:05:14.720 --> 1:05:21.760]  So, Stu Peters is the host of the Exploding Patriotically Correct Show, RedVoiceMedia.com.
[1:05:21.760 --> 1:05:26.520]  And at Real, Stu Peters, he's also on iHeart and a bunch of other places, and we appreciate
[1:05:26.520 --> 1:05:29.520]  him coming on with us to cover the waterfront today.
[1:05:29.520 --> 1:05:33.680]  I want to get into Bill Maher admitting that political correctness is destroying the U.S.
[1:05:33.680 --> 1:05:36.160]  at China's behest and so much more.
[1:05:36.160 --> 1:05:42.160]  Why is he saying that now, coming up, the inoculations, moving with experimental vaccines
[1:05:42.160 --> 1:05:46.560]  on newborn babies, pregnant women, even though the advisement by the companies says don't
[1:05:46.560 --> 1:05:47.560]  do that.
[1:05:47.560 --> 1:05:48.560]  What in the hell is going on there?
[1:05:48.560 --> 1:05:54.160]  So, Stu Peters, let's start out with this show trial where I see numbers.
[1:05:54.160 --> 1:05:58.960]  The city of Minneapolis spending 20-something million dollars to demonize the cop.
[1:05:58.960 --> 1:06:00.800]  I mean, since when can you even do that?
[1:06:00.800 --> 1:06:02.720]  He should have a missed trial right there.
[1:06:02.720 --> 1:06:07.400]  20-something million dollars or more, I guess, to the Floyd family, and it just goes on and
[1:06:07.400 --> 1:06:08.400]  on.
[1:06:08.400 --> 1:06:13.560]  You would think that this guy was like Martin Luther King or something, not a fentanyl criminal.
[1:06:13.560 --> 1:06:15.680]  Again, I'm sad he's dead.
[1:06:15.680 --> 1:06:19.640]  So, Stu, you really broke it down yesterday when I was watching you on the war room with
[1:06:19.640 --> 1:06:20.640]  Tom Pappard.
[1:06:20.640 --> 1:06:21.640]  Give us your take on it.
[1:06:21.640 --> 1:06:23.280]  Well, thanks a lot for having me.
[1:06:23.280 --> 1:06:27.720]  I mean, yeah, we're talking upwards of 100 million dollars by the time that this thing
[1:06:27.720 --> 1:06:29.560]  is all said and done.
[1:06:29.560 --> 1:06:30.560]  And you nailed it.
[1:06:30.560 --> 1:06:33.720]  I mean, this is a glaring piling on is all this is.
[1:06:33.720 --> 1:06:38.200]  The military in a quote that you had in the last segment is talking about the murder of
[1:06:38.200 --> 1:06:39.200]  George Floyd.
[1:06:39.200 --> 1:06:43.560]  We have school districts here that are setting up cry rooms and safe spaces for black and
[1:06:43.560 --> 1:06:48.520]  brown students only to be able to go and sit in and take the space that they need.
[1:06:48.520 --> 1:06:52.320]  Letters were sent home to parents so that they can process all of this in the wake of
[1:06:52.320 --> 1:06:54.160]  the murder of George Floyd.
[1:06:54.160 --> 1:06:57.760]  Keep in mind, Derek Chauvin, nor any of the other Minneapolis police officers that were
[1:06:57.760 --> 1:07:01.080]  there that were on the scene have gone through a trial.
[1:07:01.080 --> 1:07:05.960]  So due process here is not something that we deal with in the new woke states of America.
[1:07:05.960 --> 1:07:11.080]  This is a condemnation, a demasculization, a feminization, the neutering, the castration
[1:07:11.080 --> 1:07:13.600]  of law enforcement officers everywhere all over the place.
[1:07:13.600 --> 1:07:16.160]  The rank and file is no longer effective.
[1:07:16.160 --> 1:07:18.200]  Policing is 100 percent dead.
[1:07:18.200 --> 1:07:24.360]  It's been overtaken by this liberal, woke, leftist, swamp, communist, radical, totalitarian,
[1:07:24.360 --> 1:07:29.840]  fascist leadership style that basically now all law enforcement is, is the new Nazi style
[1:07:29.840 --> 1:07:34.480]  brown shirts that are out here really attacking, you know, the real crime, like the peaceful
[1:07:34.480 --> 1:07:39.240]  and patriotic insurrectionists or Trump supporters that are being villainized and rapidly hunted
[1:07:39.240 --> 1:07:42.560]  down like wild animals by the Federal Bureau of Investigation.
[1:07:42.560 --> 1:07:47.600]  Or perhaps maybe we should really look into, you know, who sold what food stamps at under
[1:07:47.600 --> 1:07:51.040]  cost but only if you're white and only if you live in a trailer park.
[1:07:51.040 --> 1:08:02.840]  What this is, is this is, this is the systemic rooting of placing blame on Republican conservatives,
[1:08:02.840 --> 1:08:07.960]  patriotic Americans, people who enjoy freedom, and this is the choking out of any conservative
[1:08:07.960 --> 1:08:08.960]  voices.
[1:08:08.960 --> 1:08:17.600]  And all they have to do is develop this mob style, gang style, sort of muscle type frustration
[1:08:17.600 --> 1:08:21.060]  of the general populace to the point where you just say, I just give up.
[1:08:21.060 --> 1:08:25.040]  The guy was murdered, these jurors that are coming in here saying, well, I've seen little
[1:08:25.040 --> 1:08:28.200]  pieces of this and I've seen little pieces of that, but I don't really know a whole
[1:08:28.200 --> 1:08:29.200]  lot about it.
[1:08:29.200 --> 1:08:34.720]  BS, there is not one place that you can go in this entire world, Alex, where somebody
[1:08:34.720 --> 1:08:40.960]  is not familiar with George Floyd and how he died at the hands of the racist cop, Derek
[1:08:40.960 --> 1:08:41.960]  Chauvin.
[1:08:41.960 --> 1:08:42.960]  It's already been set up.
[1:08:42.960 --> 1:08:43.960]  He's been tried.
[1:08:43.960 --> 1:08:45.800]  He's been convicted in the court of public opinion.
[1:08:45.800 --> 1:08:48.360]  The rest of it is just for so.
[1:08:48.360 --> 1:08:50.880]  And we know what the in game is.
[1:08:50.880 --> 1:08:54.680]  Authoritarians want to demonize local police so that under political threat they roll over
[1:08:54.680 --> 1:08:57.440]  to the left, don't prosecute crimes against the left.
[1:08:57.440 --> 1:09:03.280]  Soros has gotten hundreds of district attorneys and dozens of attorney generals, like Leticia
[1:09:03.280 --> 1:09:09.400]  James in New York, in charge so they can carry out these crimes and then prosecute people
[1:09:09.400 --> 1:09:12.480]  like Roger Stone or myself for a crooked toenail.
[1:09:12.480 --> 1:09:16.120]  This is real authoritarianism and a lot of people lionize the police.
[1:09:16.120 --> 1:09:17.120]  They're good cops.
[1:09:17.120 --> 1:09:18.120]  They're bad cops.
[1:09:18.120 --> 1:09:19.120]  They follow the Constitution.
[1:09:19.120 --> 1:09:20.120]  They're good.
[1:09:20.120 --> 1:09:21.120]  They don't.
[1:09:21.120 --> 1:09:22.120]  They're bad.
[1:09:22.120 --> 1:09:23.120]  But really the police are political.
[1:09:23.120 --> 1:09:25.800]  They are rolling over in most big cities to the left and becoming their new political
[1:09:25.800 --> 1:09:26.800]  executioners.
[1:09:26.800 --> 1:09:28.200]  This, this is a real takeover.
[1:09:28.200 --> 1:09:32.120]  I mean, right now, people look at the left dissolving the borders, they look at the left
[1:09:32.120 --> 1:09:33.120]  hurting the dollar.
[1:09:33.120 --> 1:09:35.480]  They look at the left jacking up power prices.
[1:09:35.480 --> 1:09:36.480]  That's their plan for China.
[1:09:36.480 --> 1:09:40.960]  China has produced more billionaires than all countries combined last year.
[1:09:40.960 --> 1:09:42.560]  We are in cardiac arrest.
[1:09:42.560 --> 1:09:43.760]  This has been designed.
[1:09:43.760 --> 1:09:45.560]  This is the takedown of America in my view.
[1:09:45.560 --> 1:09:46.560]  What is your view of that?
[1:09:46.560 --> 1:09:48.520]  Well, you're exactly right.
[1:09:48.520 --> 1:09:51.640]  And you know what this starts with, and I want to be clear, I mean, you're right that
[1:09:51.640 --> 1:09:53.360]  the police have been politicized.
[1:09:53.360 --> 1:09:56.560]  But I think at the street level, cops are still there to do a job.
[1:09:56.560 --> 1:10:00.520]  And let's not forget while you said that there are good cops and bad cops, there are a million
[1:10:00.520 --> 1:10:05.480]  or there about police officers in the United States of America who courageously go out
[1:10:05.480 --> 1:10:12.320]  every single day and serve the men and women of every single race, every single ethnic background.
[1:10:12.320 --> 1:10:17.440]  There is no doubt that they are the most outgunned, overwhelmed group holding the line.
[1:10:17.440 --> 1:10:18.880]  And most of them are great people.
[1:10:18.880 --> 1:10:23.680]  They're one of the greatest groups of people overall as a slice of society, still being
[1:10:23.680 --> 1:10:27.440]  professional, still being warriors against corruption and tyranny.
[1:10:27.440 --> 1:10:30.840]  And that's why the left wants to demonize them and overthrow them to become them and
[1:10:30.840 --> 1:10:31.840]  take them over.
[1:10:31.840 --> 1:10:35.880]  And I'm just simply pointing out that the right wing, the populist, the Christians need
[1:10:35.880 --> 1:10:39.400]  to get in the police face in a nice way and explain what's really happening and say, we
[1:10:39.400 --> 1:10:42.800]  stand with you, don't bow to the communist takeover.
[1:10:42.800 --> 1:10:43.800]  That's right.
[1:10:43.800 --> 1:10:44.800]  We need you here.
[1:10:44.800 --> 1:10:50.080]  And as somebody who hunted fugitives for 18 years of my adult life, chasing some of Minnesota's
[1:10:50.080 --> 1:10:53.360]  most wanted, most violent criminals who did not want to go to jail.
[1:10:53.360 --> 1:10:54.360]  That's right.
[1:10:54.360 --> 1:10:55.360]  I should have gotten into your background.
[1:10:55.360 --> 1:10:56.360]  Why you know so much about this?
[1:10:56.360 --> 1:10:57.880]  Tell us about your bounty on your background.
[1:10:57.880 --> 1:10:58.880]  Yeah.
[1:10:58.880 --> 1:11:03.400]  For 18 years, I served in Florida and here in Minnesota chasing criminals all over the
[1:11:03.400 --> 1:11:05.960]  world that were wanted out of the state of Minnesota.
[1:11:05.960 --> 1:11:09.960]  These are the most violent people who have perpetrated crimes against persons involving
[1:11:09.960 --> 1:11:14.800]  gangs, guns, drugs, rape, murder, large amounts of fentanyl and meth trafficking, manufacturing,
[1:11:14.800 --> 1:11:15.960]  all this kind of thing.
[1:11:15.960 --> 1:11:17.480]  These are people who don't want to go to prison.
[1:11:17.480 --> 1:11:21.760]  These are people who are being hunted by the U.S. Marshals, by the FBI, by federal task
[1:11:21.760 --> 1:11:23.720]  force agencies all over the place.
[1:11:23.720 --> 1:11:25.560]  These are people that don't want to go to jail.
[1:11:25.560 --> 1:11:29.280]  When I am in black and brown communities on the north side of Minneapolis, on the south
[1:11:29.280 --> 1:11:32.680]  side of Chicago, in Detroit, in Baltimore, in Philadelphia, and I'm looking for these
[1:11:32.680 --> 1:11:37.400]  bail jumpers, listen, we have real conversations on the street with real black folks, believe
[1:11:37.400 --> 1:11:40.600]  it or not, they're out there and they have a voice and you ask them about the defund
[1:11:40.600 --> 1:11:41.600]  movement.
[1:11:41.600 --> 1:11:43.120]  What do you think about defunding the police?
[1:11:43.120 --> 1:11:44.120]  Hell no.
[1:11:44.120 --> 1:11:47.640]  I lost a sister last week and a cousin last summer to gun violence.
[1:11:47.640 --> 1:11:51.280]  The real problem here is not the black and brown divide that they want to, and I know
[1:11:51.280 --> 1:11:52.280]  that you know that, Alex.
[1:11:52.280 --> 1:11:53.280]  Absolutely.
[1:11:53.280 --> 1:11:54.280]  But let's talk about this real quick.
[1:11:54.280 --> 1:11:56.800]  And we're going to talk about George Floyd next segment and get into the real rights
[1:11:56.800 --> 1:12:00.720]  numbers, the real statistics that they're trying to suppress, but take Portland, burning
[1:12:00.720 --> 1:12:03.880]  the building, huge fires, people inside.
[1:12:03.880 --> 1:12:06.600]  That is a hundred times bigger than what happened to the U.S. Capitol.
[1:12:06.600 --> 1:12:11.280]  Almost zero coverage, mainstream news is like, things got a little roundy at the courthouse.
[1:12:11.280 --> 1:12:15.640]  So again, that is what the left and the communists with the president, the fake president are
[1:12:15.640 --> 1:12:20.360]  doing is warming this up as a threat to burn down our cities and we need to stop it now.
[1:12:20.360 --> 1:12:21.360]  How do we do that?
[1:12:21.360 --> 1:12:22.920]  And this shouldn't surprise anybody.
[1:12:22.920 --> 1:12:26.600]  I mean, this is the nobody should believe a thing from the scientists to the masking
[1:12:26.600 --> 1:12:28.840]  to the numbers to anything that you hear in mainstream media.
[1:12:28.840 --> 1:12:29.920]  It's all fake.
[1:12:29.920 --> 1:12:30.920]  Everything that you see is fake.
[1:12:30.920 --> 1:12:34.360]  The pundits, the commentators, the experts, they're all fake.
[1:12:34.360 --> 1:12:35.360]  Everything that you see.
[1:12:35.360 --> 1:12:36.640]  And yes, they are warming it up.
[1:12:36.640 --> 1:12:37.960]  They have not been reporting on the fact.
[1:12:37.960 --> 1:12:42.240]  I mean, Randy Sutton, a lieutenant with the Las Vegas Police Department retired, has been
[1:12:42.240 --> 1:12:44.440]  out there in Portland covering this thing at Nazium.
[1:12:44.440 --> 1:12:48.100]  Andy Noah was forced to leave the United States of America after being assaulted.
[1:12:48.100 --> 1:12:49.800]  He has now been made out to be the criminal.
[1:12:49.800 --> 1:12:52.120]  They banned his book from being published everywhere.
[1:12:52.120 --> 1:12:55.200]  The criminals have been propped up as martyrs.
[1:12:55.200 --> 1:12:56.200]  Okay.
[1:12:56.200 --> 1:13:00.680]  We are legalizing crime in the United States of America and villainizing anybody who expects
[1:13:00.680 --> 1:13:05.160]  the protection of the police, anybody who backs or supports law enforcement, and anybody
[1:13:05.160 --> 1:13:08.680]  who just wants to get up every day, enjoy the sanctity of a nice, quiet neighborhood
[1:13:08.680 --> 1:13:09.800]  and go to work.
[1:13:09.800 --> 1:13:14.040]  If you are a white, godfearing, patriotic, Christian, conservative specifically, you
[1:13:14.040 --> 1:13:15.960]  are destined for the gulags.
[1:13:15.960 --> 1:13:16.960]  You're going to hell.
[1:13:16.960 --> 1:13:17.960]  Period.
[1:13:17.960 --> 1:13:21.240]  You're the criminal and you should watch your six because there is not anybody at the higher
[1:13:21.240 --> 1:13:24.560]  ranks of law enforcement or the government that truly has your back.
[1:13:24.560 --> 1:13:27.960]  All these institutions that we were raised, Alex, trying to be taught, these are the people
[1:13:27.960 --> 1:13:30.960]  that we can trust are exactly the ones that are coming after you.
[1:13:30.960 --> 1:13:31.960]  All right.
[1:13:31.960 --> 1:13:35.160]  Syndicated talk show host, former bounty hunters, Stu Peters is our guest.
[1:13:35.160 --> 1:13:39.760]  We're going to come back and zoom in on the George Floyd show trial coming up and how
[1:13:39.760 --> 1:13:44.080]  it's designed to have a whole new time bomb of riots and burning and all of this.
[1:13:44.080 --> 1:13:46.920]  People say, well, wow, this will make Biden really unpopular.
[1:13:46.920 --> 1:13:47.920]  They don't care.
[1:13:47.920 --> 1:13:48.920]  He stole the election.
[1:13:48.920 --> 1:13:49.920]  That's the whole point.
[1:13:49.920 --> 1:13:51.920]  I'm Alex Jones.
[1:13:51.920 --> 1:13:54.640]  Stay with us.
[1:13:54.640 --> 1:13:57.000]  You know, it's crazy to get to this point.
[1:13:57.000 --> 1:13:58.920]  It's very bittersweet.
[1:13:58.920 --> 1:14:01.760]  Everything we've talked about has happened just like we said it would.
[1:14:01.760 --> 1:14:03.840]  And now we have a lot of credibility, but I don't care about that.
[1:14:03.840 --> 1:14:05.360]  I care about beating the new world border.
[1:14:05.360 --> 1:14:10.680]  And it's because we have so much credibility, they can't allow us to stay on air much longer.
[1:14:10.680 --> 1:14:13.920]  And I don't have time to tell you all the stuff they're doing to us for a lot of reasons.
[1:14:13.920 --> 1:14:17.520]  I can't tell you what's going on, but let's just say this, we're going to see this through
[1:14:17.520 --> 1:14:21.160]  to the end where it stay on air as long as we can.
[1:14:21.160 --> 1:14:24.800]  So please pray for us and please buy the products and then forwardstore.com.

[1:14:30.240 --> 1:14:31.240]  Do they fund freedom?
[1:14:31.240 --> 1:14:32.600]  No, a lot of them don't.
[1:14:32.600 --> 1:14:37.240]  These are great products that fund freedom and fund justice when the whole world's waking
[1:14:37.240 --> 1:14:39.040]  up and looking for truth.
[1:14:39.040 --> 1:14:40.680]  That's why the globalists are censoring.
[1:14:40.680 --> 1:14:44.120]  They can't bring in all this tyranny and leave people like us on the air.
[1:14:44.120 --> 1:14:47.600]  So while you're at it, don't just financially support us and spread the word.

[1:14:51.040 --> 1:14:54.960]  going to be on the air and the enemy is trying to destroy everything we ever said.
[1:14:54.960 --> 1:14:59.440]  As you know, we're always upping our game at M Full Wars and we brought you a new supplement,
[1:14:59.440 --> 1:15:03.000]  a new product that we know you're going to love, especially if you have trouble sleeping.
[1:15:03.000 --> 1:15:04.080]  It is down and out.
[1:15:04.080 --> 1:15:05.880]  We don't mean bankrupt under a bridge.
[1:15:05.880 --> 1:15:08.880]  We mean down your bed, sleeping hard throughout the night.
[1:15:08.880 --> 1:15:11.960]  It's got four milligrams of high quality melatonin.
[1:15:11.960 --> 1:15:14.520]  It's got 25 milligrams of passion flower.

[1:15:18.160 --> 1:15:23.120]  It's got 100 milligrams of lemon balm and 150 milligrams of German chamomile.
[1:15:23.120 --> 1:15:25.680]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is a very strong formula.
[1:15:25.680 --> 1:15:28.840]  I recommend you only take a quarter or a half the first time.

[1:15:30.760 --> 1:15:34.960]  If you take it sublingually under the tongue, oh, how about blasting off a sleep?
[1:15:34.960 --> 1:15:35.960]  It's incredible.
[1:15:35.960 --> 1:15:38.120]  It's basically a liquid formula of rocket rest.
[1:15:38.120 --> 1:15:40.720]  It's so popular we can't keep it in stock.

[1:15:58.400 --> 1:16:22.400]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:16:22.400 --> 1:16:31.400]  Welcome back.
[1:16:31.400 --> 1:16:36.040]  I'm your host, Alex Jones and Stu Peters, former bounty hunter.
[1:16:36.040 --> 1:16:40.240]  The top show host is kicking butt and reaching a lot of people and the show is exploding.
[1:16:40.240 --> 1:16:43.720]  You love to see that because we are all in this together.
[1:16:43.720 --> 1:16:48.720]  The answer to censorship is more people stepping up becoming top show hosts and you build it.
[1:16:48.720 --> 1:16:50.040]  They will come and you're telling the truth.
[1:16:50.040 --> 1:16:55.800]  If you, since my urgency, his urgency, this is a global stabilization program.
[1:16:55.800 --> 1:16:57.720]  The FBI at the top is totally corrupt.
[1:16:57.720 --> 1:17:00.400]  They're saying patriots and gun owners and Christians are terrorists.
[1:17:00.400 --> 1:17:02.360]  The Pentagon is being trained to take our guns.
[1:17:02.360 --> 1:17:04.520]  General Honorary is preparing a plan.
[1:17:04.520 --> 1:17:09.080]  They have all these, the press secretary says, yes, we're going to have the CIA and military
[1:17:09.080 --> 1:17:10.320]  go after Trump supporters.
[1:17:10.320 --> 1:17:13.840]  And as Tucker Carlson said, well, you're only good at paying off Iranians and handing
[1:17:13.840 --> 1:17:14.840]  over countries.
[1:17:14.840 --> 1:17:17.720]  But seriously, they're purging the military.
[1:17:17.720 --> 1:17:18.720]  They're purging the police.
[1:17:18.720 --> 1:17:23.200]  So while they try to have the police and military come after us, we have to understand they're
[1:17:23.200 --> 1:17:25.600]  just engaged in more divide and conquer.
[1:17:25.600 --> 1:17:29.600]  These are globalists that stole the election that are involved in a criminal takeover.
[1:17:29.600 --> 1:17:31.360]  They're obviously getting ready for more race riots.
[1:17:31.360 --> 1:17:32.360]  They've already triggered them.
[1:17:32.360 --> 1:17:33.600]  They've already activated them.
[1:17:33.600 --> 1:17:36.960]  And I want to ask you, because you're a smart fellow, where you see this going and how you
[1:17:36.960 --> 1:17:39.520]  think we should all stand up and counter it now.
[1:17:39.520 --> 1:17:43.520]  Then we'll get into their next big detonator, their next big flashpoint, the show trial
[1:17:43.520 --> 1:17:45.600]  of this police officer in Minnesota.
[1:17:45.600 --> 1:17:50.640]  Well, I mean, I think, first of all, you know, we cannot talk about all these pundits are
[1:17:50.640 --> 1:17:53.520]  talking about 2022 and 2024.
[1:17:53.520 --> 1:17:58.400]  And you know, we need to elect America first people and, you know, the conservatives and
[1:17:58.400 --> 1:18:00.880]  the Republican Party needs a complete revamping and all that.
[1:18:00.880 --> 1:18:02.040]  Hold on a second.
[1:18:02.040 --> 1:18:09.480]  Have we forgotten that just a few months ago in 2020 in November, an election was completely
[1:18:09.480 --> 1:18:10.960]  stolen from us?
[1:18:10.960 --> 1:18:15.040]  I mean, seriously, we have to stop and think about that.
[1:18:15.040 --> 1:18:16.720]  This has to be addressed.
[1:18:16.720 --> 1:18:18.560]  We can't move on anywhere.
[1:18:18.560 --> 1:18:20.320]  There is never another Republican.
[1:18:20.320 --> 1:18:22.640]  There is never another America first conservative.
[1:18:22.640 --> 1:18:27.320]  There is never another person with those core values and principles that will be elected
[1:18:27.320 --> 1:18:32.480]  under fair circumstances or ever again, if we don't address the elephant in the room,
[1:18:32.480 --> 1:18:36.120]  which is that this net this needs to be fixed right now.
[1:18:36.120 --> 1:18:37.640]  And how to go about doing that?
[1:18:37.640 --> 1:18:40.160]  I mean, I guess, Alex, I don't really know.
[1:18:40.160 --> 1:18:41.680]  I've been thinking about that.
[1:18:41.680 --> 1:18:46.120]  I think we just admit that this is a far and shy comeback takeover and we get governors
[1:18:46.120 --> 1:18:47.400]  and coalitions to come together.
[1:18:47.400 --> 1:18:52.720]  We have commissions and we expose it and we get states to pass laws blocking HR one.
[1:18:52.720 --> 1:18:54.240]  We stop HR one.
[1:18:54.240 --> 1:18:57.800]  And I think we get really, really aggressive and really, really serious.
[1:18:57.800 --> 1:19:00.200]  I mean, they're starting this process in Arizona.
[1:19:00.200 --> 1:19:04.400]  I know that Jake Hoffman there has had some really good legislation that's got teeth in
[1:19:04.400 --> 1:19:08.480]  it that will make felonies, you know, out of out of any of this kind of nefarious activity
[1:19:08.480 --> 1:19:09.680]  when it comes to our elections.
[1:19:09.680 --> 1:19:11.560]  And I think that that's good and dandy.
[1:19:11.560 --> 1:19:12.560]  But what about this?
[1:19:12.560 --> 1:19:16.040]  What about Jovan Pulitzer not being able to get in there to Arizona?
[1:19:16.040 --> 1:19:18.960]  Why are lawmakers, including Republicans, saying, no, no, no, we don't want to audit
[1:19:18.960 --> 1:19:19.960]  this thing anymore.
[1:19:19.960 --> 1:19:22.520]  Why are we closing the book on it is what I'm talking about.
[1:19:22.520 --> 1:19:26.440]  I mean, listen, that's because they know if one domino falls and we know it's in all
[1:19:26.440 --> 1:19:29.640]  these states, then it legitimizes what we've said.
[1:19:29.640 --> 1:19:32.080]  And so that's why they won't ever let us do an audit.
[1:19:32.080 --> 1:19:37.400]  And so when I say take it back, when I say moving on to 2022 and 24 is pointless, it
[1:19:37.400 --> 1:19:40.440]  doesn't matter about Donald Trump at this point because he's just one man.
[1:19:40.440 --> 1:19:41.440]  Right?
[1:19:41.440 --> 1:19:43.680]  He's arguably the best president of my lifetime.
[1:19:43.680 --> 1:19:49.480]  I'm only 40 years old, but, you know, this is one person, Alex, and he's responsible
[1:19:49.480 --> 1:19:50.480]  for the great awakening.
[1:19:50.480 --> 1:19:55.840]  OK, none of us would know Jack about what we know right now about how deep the cabal
[1:19:55.840 --> 1:20:00.360]  really goes, that the roundtable faction, the globalist elitists and how deep the swamp
[1:20:00.360 --> 1:20:01.360]  really is.
[1:20:01.360 --> 1:20:05.080]  I mean, he could have spent 10 terms, 40 years in the Oval Office and not even begin to have
[1:20:05.080 --> 1:20:07.520]  scratched the surface on draining that thing.
[1:20:07.520 --> 1:20:11.040]  And so this needs to happen literally one person at a time.
[1:20:11.040 --> 1:20:15.840]  And I don't know what that looks like as far as the removal of these people and the purge,
[1:20:15.840 --> 1:20:19.520]  but the legacy of Donald Trump is what we really need to embrace.
[1:20:19.520 --> 1:20:21.120]  And that's on us.
[1:20:21.120 --> 1:20:22.120]  He can't do it anymore.
[1:20:22.120 --> 1:20:25.760]  We can't pin everything on this or waiting for the military to take control.
[1:20:25.760 --> 1:20:28.440]  I mean, for crying out loud, look at what the military is doing.
[1:20:28.440 --> 1:20:33.960]  I mean, these people are developing a gay bomb and the Tanooka saw and they're sending
[1:20:33.960 --> 1:20:39.880]  women in their second trimester into Mach 2 speeds over Syria as we bomb kids with drones
[1:20:39.880 --> 1:20:43.120]  that are named after Gillain Maxwell for crying out loud.
[1:20:43.120 --> 1:20:45.080]  I mean, this is absolutely absurd.
[1:20:45.080 --> 1:20:49.840]  So counting on the military, counting on Sidney Powell or Rudy Giuliani, although be it everybody
[1:20:49.840 --> 1:20:52.800]  was waiting for Lin Woods, Great Revelation and all that, that's great.
[1:20:52.800 --> 1:20:56.600]  And these might be really noble carriers of an actual real message.
[1:20:56.600 --> 1:21:01.240]  But the fact is, and until we actually pick up the ball and run with it, whatever that
[1:21:01.240 --> 1:21:02.240]  looks like.
[1:21:02.240 --> 1:21:03.240]  I agree.
[1:21:03.240 --> 1:21:04.240]  I agree.
[1:21:04.240 --> 1:21:05.240]  We cannot give people false hope.
[1:21:05.240 --> 1:21:07.440]  And of course, everything Q said was the opposite.
[1:21:07.440 --> 1:21:10.560]  It was the inverse of what was really going to go down.
[1:21:10.560 --> 1:21:12.120]  It's not the military is going to save us.
[1:21:12.120 --> 1:21:13.120]  It's the truth.
[1:21:13.120 --> 1:21:14.120]  It's justice.
[1:21:14.120 --> 1:21:15.120]  It's our legislatures.
[1:21:15.120 --> 1:21:16.120]  It's our churches.
[1:21:16.120 --> 1:21:20.440]  It's us, as men and women standing up and saying no to all of this and realizing this
[1:21:20.440 --> 1:21:21.440]  is a global takeover.
[1:21:21.440 --> 1:21:23.160]  I totally agree with you.
[1:21:23.160 --> 1:21:26.640]  And the Psyop, you know, I mean, we have to be able to counter that in some way.
[1:21:26.640 --> 1:21:29.520]  And we were talking George Floyd here in the city of Minneapolis.
[1:21:29.520 --> 1:21:32.440]  This is the next international Psyop is what it is.
[1:21:32.440 --> 1:21:35.440]  I mean, they've already found him guilty.
[1:21:35.440 --> 1:21:37.280]  This is just a part of the Psyop.
[1:21:37.280 --> 1:21:43.440]  I mean, the March, everything that was the last nail in the coffin by just this propaganda
[1:21:43.440 --> 1:21:46.920]  spreading at nauseam on the mainstream media is just absolutely ridiculous.
[1:21:46.920 --> 1:21:50.840]  And when you think the message is, give us what we want or we'll burn down cities, then
[1:21:50.840 --> 1:21:54.880]  the media can inflame groups whenever they want over anything and have a basically a
[1:21:54.880 --> 1:21:56.120]  gun to our head.
[1:21:56.120 --> 1:22:00.120]  If we capitulate to this type of terrorism, the globalists, the communists dominate the
[1:22:00.120 --> 1:22:03.800]  country using their liberation theology.
[1:22:03.800 --> 1:22:07.480]  I mean, if anybody knows about cancellation and the threat of arrest, it's Alex Jones,
[1:22:07.480 --> 1:22:08.480]  right?
[1:22:08.480 --> 1:22:12.840]  I mean, look, I was I was targeted even as a bounty hunter by political adversaries
[1:22:12.840 --> 1:22:17.120]  of mine, people that I didn't even work for or work alongside elected sheriffs didn't
[1:22:17.120 --> 1:22:21.480]  like the fact that I had the authority and even in most situations as pertaining to a
[1:22:21.480 --> 1:22:25.440]  warrant or a bail jumper, a greater level of authority than they did and would actually
[1:22:25.440 --> 1:22:30.120]  try to politically step in my way under the threat of arrest and prosecution.
[1:22:30.120 --> 1:22:36.400]  If I should go and, you know, grab somebody who raped three innocent children in Minneapolis,
[1:22:36.400 --> 1:22:40.040]  we went to Mexico to get them, you know, and they were trying to hold the prosecution
[1:22:40.040 --> 1:22:44.500]  of false imprisonment and illegal extradition over my head and all of these different kinds
[1:22:44.500 --> 1:22:47.160]  of things because they weren't the ones to go arrest him.
[1:22:47.160 --> 1:22:52.960]  So, you know, they say that invention, they say that necessity is the mother of invention.
[1:22:52.960 --> 1:22:56.800]  Is that how you became a talk show host was just to get the truth about what you'd gone
[1:22:56.800 --> 1:22:57.800]  through out there?
[1:22:57.800 --> 1:23:01.640]  Well, you know, I mean, I worked for a clear channel prior to becoming a bounty hunter
[1:23:01.640 --> 1:23:04.800]  and I was just a guy who introduced songs on top 40 radio.
[1:23:04.800 --> 1:23:09.560]  So, you know, radio is something that I've always loved, you know, the natural transition
[1:23:09.560 --> 1:23:14.000]  from bounty hunting into patriotically correct is that I'm still dealing with criminals only
[1:23:14.000 --> 1:23:16.200]  now they're just elected representatives.
[1:23:16.200 --> 1:23:20.320]  And so exposing the criminals has become really easy because thinking like a criminal has
[1:23:20.320 --> 1:23:22.960]  been what I have had to do for the last 18 years.
[1:23:22.960 --> 1:23:27.160]  And really all you have to look at when you think something isn't right and when you trust
[1:23:27.160 --> 1:23:32.160]  your gut, which is how I was raised by my dad, a Vietnam War veteran, a hero in my eyes
[1:23:32.160 --> 1:23:37.240]  and my mother too, they taught me to trust your gut, always go with your intuition, pray
[1:23:37.240 --> 1:23:38.920]  to God and trust your gut.
[1:23:38.920 --> 1:23:42.400]  And when you feel like something isn't right people, what you have to understand is that
[1:23:42.400 --> 1:23:44.000]  you're right about that.
[1:23:44.000 --> 1:23:47.600]  Look at yourself in the mirror physically and tell yourself, I am not crazy.
[1:23:47.600 --> 1:23:49.840]  Like this is really going on around me.
[1:23:49.840 --> 1:23:54.280]  And that is the only way that's why that's why God gave us an internal compass and internal
[1:23:54.280 --> 1:23:57.880]  navigation or being gas lit to know what the truth is.
[1:23:57.880 --> 1:23:58.880]  Exactly.
[1:23:58.880 --> 1:24:03.640]  And so the transition from radio into or excuse me, bounty hunting into radio and dealing
[1:24:03.640 --> 1:24:07.400]  with criminals has been natural because all you have to look at is who had what to gain
[1:24:07.400 --> 1:24:09.400]  by committing this crime.
[1:24:09.400 --> 1:24:12.480]  And that'll open up your eyes in a completely new way when you're talking about people like
[1:24:12.480 --> 1:24:15.600]  the highest paid guy in our federal government, Anthony Fauci.
[1:24:15.600 --> 1:24:16.600]  He's a criminal.
[1:24:16.600 --> 1:24:17.600]  He's a liar.
[1:24:17.600 --> 1:24:21.240]  He's a personal investor in the lab in Wuhan, China that this thing, I mean, I didn't get
[1:24:21.240 --> 1:24:25.280]  a call from my financial advisor saying, Hey, I got a great tip on this obscure lab in Wuhan.
[1:24:25.280 --> 1:24:26.280]  Did you?
[1:24:26.280 --> 1:24:27.280]  I mean, come on.
[1:24:27.280 --> 1:24:28.280]  You know, I did.
[1:24:28.280 --> 1:24:33.320]  But you know, Pfizer just sit on a prospectus to their employees and to their shareholders
[1:24:33.320 --> 1:24:35.480]  saying, Oh, we're going to have five shots a year.
[1:24:35.480 --> 1:24:38.040]  We're going to jack up the price and we're going to take over the world.
[1:24:38.040 --> 1:24:39.040]  This is incredible.
[1:24:39.040 --> 1:24:40.040]  Let's get back into.
[1:24:40.040 --> 1:24:43.840]  I saw you yesterday on the war room here on the enforce that we're talking about crime
[1:24:43.840 --> 1:24:45.880]  statistics and the black on white crime.
[1:24:45.880 --> 1:24:46.880]  They're trying to suppress.
[1:24:46.880 --> 1:24:54.280]  And I think the truth of that is the antidote to claim there's this false epidemic of black
[1:24:54.280 --> 1:24:55.280]  on white crime.
[1:24:55.280 --> 1:24:58.240]  Throughout history, there have been two basic forms of civilizations and different mixes
[1:24:58.240 --> 1:24:59.240]  of the two.
[1:24:59.240 --> 1:25:00.240]  One is born of Renaissance.
[1:25:00.240 --> 1:25:02.280]  The other is born of conquest.
[1:25:02.280 --> 1:25:07.920]  One bases its power on having strong, enlightened, focused people with an ethos and a culture
[1:25:07.920 --> 1:25:11.320]  and ingenuity, art and skill and strength.
[1:25:11.320 --> 1:25:16.560]  The other is based on the massive number of slaves it controls with a tiny elite about
[1:25:16.560 --> 1:25:17.560]  it.
[1:25:17.560 --> 1:25:22.880]  America is transferring out of a system based on the ethos of liberty and freedom into one
[1:25:22.880 --> 1:25:25.280]  of total mass high tech slavery.
[1:25:25.280 --> 1:25:29.400]  That's why the globalists tell us America was founded on slavery when it wasn't.
[1:25:29.400 --> 1:25:33.200]  They point out one of our evils so they can invert the fact that they are truly the slave
[1:25:33.200 --> 1:25:34.200]  masters.
[1:25:34.200 --> 1:25:36.160]  A global permanent lockdown is here.
[1:25:36.160 --> 1:25:39.440]  It's already causing millions and millions of starving deaths.
[1:25:39.440 --> 1:25:41.640]  When they're done, billions will starve to death.
[1:25:41.640 --> 1:25:45.280]  Even the former head of the Ministry of Defense in England, Anatole General, have come out
[1:25:45.280 --> 1:25:49.520]  and said the coming lockdown is going to trigger a giant new world war.
[1:25:49.520 --> 1:25:50.520]  That's the facts.
[1:25:50.520 --> 1:25:53.160]  This is the Bill Gates New World Order weapon.
[1:25:53.160 --> 1:25:57.040]  You do not hide a grand assault.
[1:25:57.040 --> 1:26:02.000]  America is about to have its energy cut off, its borders destroyed, its dollar brought
[1:26:02.000 --> 1:26:03.720]  down to nothing.
[1:26:03.720 --> 1:26:08.760]  All of you that have served Satan believe that you are on the right team.
[1:26:08.760 --> 1:26:11.720]  You're about to find out how pathetic you are.
[1:26:11.720 --> 1:26:18.920]  So I ask all of you who are awake and who love God, stop living in fear.
[1:26:18.920 --> 1:26:21.720]  The enemy is about to expose itself.
[1:26:21.720 --> 1:26:24.040]  The enemy can't help itself.
[1:26:24.040 --> 1:26:28.120]  The enemy comes to kill, steal, and destroy.
[1:26:28.120 --> 1:26:32.120]  We sit here as good people get upset about that and try to stop it.
[1:26:32.120 --> 1:26:33.120]  We should.
[1:26:33.120 --> 1:26:38.800]  But once it comes through, once it hits us, once it's dominating us and raping us and
[1:26:38.800 --> 1:26:43.560]  attacking us, we just have to point out we tried to stop it.
[1:26:43.560 --> 1:26:45.720]  So prepare yourselves, America.
[1:26:45.720 --> 1:26:49.400]  You're going under judgement just like all the children that were aborted.
[1:26:49.400 --> 1:26:51.040]  This is the truth.
[1:26:51.040 --> 1:26:53.200]  This is the InfoWare.

[1:27:56.320 --> 1:28:19.920]  Start listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:28:19.920 --> 1:28:27.320]  They wanted Joe Biden in there because they knew he was easily controlled, bought and paid
[1:28:27.320 --> 1:28:32.720]  for by Communist China, and his entire group of individuals around him are compromised,
[1:28:32.720 --> 1:28:39.280]  so the deep state could fully keep him on a short leash, but he's deteriorated so quickly
[1:28:39.280 --> 1:28:44.720]  now, and the things he's saying are so out of control now, I don't see what they do,
[1:28:44.720 --> 1:28:49.760]  and I want to ask our guest, Stu Peters, of Red Voice Media Center, to talk to us what
[1:28:49.760 --> 1:28:57.520]  his take on all this is, and I want to get to these clips of the White House saying that
[1:28:57.520 --> 1:29:03.720]  it's Trump's fault that 4,200 children are now sleeping on floor in cages with no sunlight,
[1:29:03.720 --> 1:29:10.080]  even though they're all coming wearing Biden shirts paid for by NGOs to come here.
[1:29:10.080 --> 1:29:11.320]  So this is just incredible.
[1:29:11.320 --> 1:29:13.880]  This is the whole UN invasion of the country.
[1:29:13.880 --> 1:29:17.480]  We're going to talk about that in a moment, but just finishing up with these statistics.
[1:29:17.480 --> 1:29:22.520]  As you said, real black folks voted for Trump in record numbers, but if you look at the
[1:29:22.520 --> 1:29:26.560]  real statistics, the media promotes attacking white people, and there is black on white
[1:29:26.560 --> 1:29:33.560]  racially motivated crime, and also motivated attacks on Asians, and in New York, when they've
[1:29:33.560 --> 1:29:38.200]  had attacks on Asians, they then have marches against white supremacy, so the level of gas
[1:29:38.200 --> 1:29:44.320]  sliding has reached mad hatter levels here, and so lay out some of those numbers.
[1:29:44.320 --> 1:29:49.680]  Well, you know, I don't have exact up to date numbers.
[1:29:49.680 --> 1:29:55.040]  Here's what I do have, and I only stopped chasing fugitives just weeks ago after 18
[1:29:55.040 --> 1:29:59.960]  years of doing this, and so it was my job in writing and staying proficient in these
[1:29:59.960 --> 1:30:05.320]  numbers to understand what's really going on in every single community that we serve,
[1:30:05.320 --> 1:30:08.680]  because regardless of whether or not we're cops, we're doing a job where we're arresting
[1:30:08.680 --> 1:30:12.880]  people, taking people to jail, and it's a very real probability I've been shot at.
[1:30:12.880 --> 1:30:20.280]  I mainly deal with people of color, with black folks, and I don't know why that is,
[1:30:20.280 --> 1:30:25.040]  but that's just what the facts are, and the facts are that last year, when we look at
[1:30:25.040 --> 1:30:28.720]  the cops and the black people and this big theory of systemic racism, and I'm looking
[1:30:28.720 --> 1:30:35.240]  at it right here, nine unarmed black people were killed by cops last year, nine.
[1:30:35.240 --> 1:30:40.160]  Nineteen white unarmed people were killed by cops last year.
[1:30:40.160 --> 1:30:45.160]  Our officers are killed every single year than unarmed blacks, so the question is, when
[1:30:45.160 --> 1:30:47.080]  is the blue lives matter?
[1:30:47.080 --> 1:30:48.080]  People gonna have their change.
[1:30:48.080 --> 1:30:49.080]  Well, way more police are.
[1:30:49.080 --> 1:30:50.080]  Well, exactly.
[1:30:50.080 --> 1:30:51.080]  We never hear the name of dead cops, and here's the deal.
[1:30:51.080 --> 1:30:54.960]  I'm surprised there aren't more people, period being shot, because there's mistakes made.
[1:30:54.960 --> 1:30:57.800]  I can't believe the numbers are so low.
[1:30:57.800 --> 1:31:02.280]  The police with 350 million people aren't accidentally killing more people.
[1:31:02.280 --> 1:31:07.480]  How many people, how many kids, how many kids under the age of 18 from the black community
[1:31:07.480 --> 1:31:11.760]  in cities like Chicago and cities like Minneapolis, two thousand blacks were killed on average
[1:31:11.760 --> 1:31:14.880]  in Chicago, 98% of them by blacks.
[1:31:14.880 --> 1:31:16.960]  And where is black lives matter on this?
[1:31:16.960 --> 1:31:20.920]  You know, I mean, so we go back to the gut feeling, we go back to the intuition that
[1:31:20.920 --> 1:31:24.840]  you were raised with, we go back to the common sense, the independent and individual free
[1:31:24.840 --> 1:31:29.840]  and critical thinking that has just gone by the wayside since the introduction of these
[1:31:29.840 --> 1:31:34.320]  mobile devices, these smart phones, these tablets, the information super highway, this
[1:31:34.320 --> 1:31:37.040]  immediate sense of gratification.
[1:31:37.040 --> 1:31:38.040]  News is not news anymore.
[1:31:38.040 --> 1:31:41.800]  Remember Walter Cronkite used to read the news and then it was up to mom and dad at
[1:31:41.800 --> 1:31:42.800]  the dinner table.
[1:31:42.800 --> 1:31:47.480]  If you grew up that way with both of your parents or like me came from a divorced home, didn't
[1:31:47.480 --> 1:31:51.440]  really have a whole lot, you know, financially, monetarily, my parents did okay, but I wasn't
[1:31:51.440 --> 1:31:53.000]  silver spoon fed.
[1:31:53.000 --> 1:31:57.240]  And you know, the conversation was left to your folks or to your family at the dinner
[1:31:57.240 --> 1:32:00.640]  table to kind of then enter the subjection or form an opinion.
[1:32:00.640 --> 1:32:02.280]  That's what you learned about the world.
[1:32:02.280 --> 1:32:05.840]  Your own experiences in your family, not from MSNBC.
[1:32:05.840 --> 1:32:06.840]  That's right.
[1:32:06.840 --> 1:32:11.640]  And so now we're not only told what the news is, which isn't really even the news, but
[1:32:11.640 --> 1:32:14.320]  now we're even told how to interpret this news.
[1:32:14.320 --> 1:32:19.520]  And if you interpret it in any other way, now you've become a danger to society.
[1:32:19.520 --> 1:32:24.400]  Your parents could be dangerous if they say, if they don't prefer to wear a mask, for example.
[1:32:24.400 --> 1:32:28.480]  And now we're looking at the possibility and it's actually happening in Broward County.
[1:32:28.480 --> 1:32:33.360]  A judge actually took a child away from a mother because she posted on Facebook a picture
[1:32:33.360 --> 1:32:35.240]  of herself donning her mask was faced.
[1:32:35.240 --> 1:32:39.280]  I mean, a judge actually said, no, you're a danger to the child and took the child away
[1:32:39.280 --> 1:32:42.880]  from the mother in the name of health and that's exactly where I was going.
[1:32:42.880 --> 1:32:47.720]  Now that you segue into that, we've got marvelous Marvin Hagler, a great part of the community
[1:32:47.720 --> 1:32:50.200]  and you've got Hank Aaron, amazing guy.
[1:32:50.200 --> 1:32:52.680]  They're both dead after they took the COVID shot.
[1:32:52.680 --> 1:32:54.560]  The family say, yeah, it's the shop that killed them.
[1:32:54.560 --> 1:32:57.520]  The media tries to cover it up, but we have record numbers of old people.
[1:32:57.520 --> 1:33:01.480]  I had a doctor call in yesterday, he's lost 22 patients because he takes care of old people
[1:33:01.480 --> 1:33:02.480]  that took the shot.
[1:33:02.480 --> 1:33:03.480]  Well, we see that in the news.
[1:33:03.480 --> 1:33:07.920]  20 countries just banned one of them, the Pfizer has been banned because people dying
[1:33:07.920 --> 1:33:08.920]  in India.
[1:33:08.920 --> 1:33:09.920]  This is real stuff.
[1:33:09.920 --> 1:33:11.400]  So where's Black Lives Matter there?
[1:33:11.400 --> 1:33:14.480]  Well, they're funded by George Soros and Bill Gates and others.
[1:33:14.480 --> 1:33:18.720]  So that's why they're there to cover up for the big corporations, the death camps that
[1:33:18.720 --> 1:33:20.400]  Apple's running in China.
[1:33:20.400 --> 1:33:23.880]  That's why they spend a hundred million on Black Lives Matter to go look black people.
[1:33:23.880 --> 1:33:25.480]  Look, I'm not racist.
[1:33:25.480 --> 1:33:27.480]  It's just absolutely insane.
[1:33:27.480 --> 1:33:31.600]  Black Lives Matter also funding Blue Dot, which then of course billions of dollars to
[1:33:31.600 --> 1:33:34.440]  the DNC, which actually then funds Planned Parenthood.
[1:33:34.440 --> 1:33:38.120]  I mean, it's no secret that these people have wanted to kill black babies for the longest
[1:33:38.120 --> 1:33:39.120]  time.
[1:33:39.120 --> 1:33:42.800]  I mean, they're the biggest proponents of killing black babies, the Democrats, the
[1:33:42.800 --> 1:33:43.800]  Rapples.
[1:33:43.800 --> 1:33:44.800]  And let's be clear.
[1:33:44.800 --> 1:33:47.920]  LBJ said, because we look at crime rates for black and white, they're about the same.
[1:33:47.920 --> 1:33:52.360]  Actually, some areas were higher than with whites and blacks in the 20s and 30s.
[1:33:52.360 --> 1:33:56.680]  But as soon as the 50s and 60s hit, they take men out of the house, drugs are shipped in
[1:33:56.680 --> 1:34:01.360]  the communities, the beta test was a black community, you get 80% illogitimacy, and then
[1:34:01.360 --> 1:34:02.880]  you get crime waves.
[1:34:02.880 --> 1:34:03.880]  And it's the same everywhere.
[1:34:03.880 --> 1:34:06.000]  You take dads out of the house, you get crime waves.
[1:34:06.000 --> 1:34:07.440]  And then now that's where it is.
[1:34:07.440 --> 1:34:10.320]  So this was literally engineered, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:34:10.320 --> 1:34:13.520]  But now we've got a crime wave out of the black community with the media saying, go
[1:34:13.520 --> 1:34:18.000]  out and attack white people and the knockout games, the muggings.
[1:34:18.000 --> 1:34:22.240]  This is clearly racially motivated at a level we never even saw from the KKK.
[1:34:22.240 --> 1:34:24.480]  It was another terrible organization.
[1:34:24.480 --> 1:34:28.680]  When you go to the south side of Minneapolis, right now, for example, they have this quote
[1:34:28.680 --> 1:34:33.080]  unexplainable plague of carjackings, targeting white people.
[1:34:33.080 --> 1:34:34.080]  Really?
[1:34:34.080 --> 1:34:35.080]  Is it unexplainable?
[1:34:35.080 --> 1:34:38.320]  Well, how about you just go back to exactly what you just said, Alex Jones.
[1:34:38.320 --> 1:34:42.520]  Let's go back to how many of these kids grew up in fatherless homes on the south side of
[1:34:42.520 --> 1:34:43.520]  Chicago.
[1:34:43.520 --> 1:34:44.520]  Why are they in Minneapolis?
[1:34:44.520 --> 1:34:47.200]  Well, could it be because Minneapolis is the welfare city?
[1:34:47.200 --> 1:34:51.520]  Could it be because Minnesota, historically, and for decades run by, I don't know why,
[1:34:51.520 --> 1:34:55.680]  but by liberal Democrats who just have this welfare state, what is the motivation to go
[1:34:55.680 --> 1:34:56.720]  to work?
[1:34:56.720 --> 1:35:00.400]  What is the motivation to do anything positive when they can be compensated at levels that
[1:35:00.400 --> 1:35:01.400]  are higher than what?
[1:35:01.400 --> 1:35:05.720]  And let's be clear, they defunded the police massively in Minneapolis, and then they hired
[1:35:05.720 --> 1:35:06.720]  private bodyguards.
[1:35:06.720 --> 1:35:09.240]  Tell folks about that for the city council.
[1:35:09.240 --> 1:35:10.920]  Yeah, of course they did.
[1:35:10.920 --> 1:35:15.760]  And then the same city council president who defund the police, get rid of the police,
[1:35:15.760 --> 1:35:17.760]  take all guns away from police.
[1:35:17.760 --> 1:35:22.280]  We want an unarmed health and safety commission rather than the Minneapolis police department
[1:35:22.280 --> 1:35:24.560]  is now standing in the same park.
[1:35:24.560 --> 1:35:28.240]  Theater Field Park is what it's called right there in the Longfellow neighborhood of Minneapolis,
[1:35:28.240 --> 1:35:32.080]  where she grabbed probably the same exact bullhorn addressing the same exact crowd and
[1:35:32.080 --> 1:35:33.520]  now yelling at the police.
[1:35:33.520 --> 1:35:34.520]  Where are you?
[1:35:34.520 --> 1:35:35.520]  Where are the police?
[1:35:35.520 --> 1:35:36.680]  I saw that yesterday.
[1:35:36.680 --> 1:35:37.680]  It's crazy.
[1:35:37.680 --> 1:35:41.280]  She's now bitching at them saying they won't put us up with the left where they don't think
[1:35:41.280 --> 1:35:42.280]  we have a memory.
[1:35:42.280 --> 1:35:44.920]  I mean, it's insane.
[1:35:44.920 --> 1:35:49.960]  Do they think that we don't have a memory or are they just too plain stupid to remember
[1:35:49.960 --> 1:35:52.040]  what they said just yesterday?
[1:35:52.040 --> 1:35:53.920]  Because this is what the media is again.
[1:35:53.920 --> 1:35:55.120]  It's sound bites.
[1:35:55.120 --> 1:35:58.600]  And I was trying to articulate that before we had to go to break in the last segment,
[1:35:58.600 --> 1:36:01.360]  but we're told how to feel about stories.
[1:36:01.360 --> 1:36:03.760]  And we don't get the full story in its context.
[1:36:03.760 --> 1:36:07.520]  You don't hear that George Floyd, you don't look at the medical examiner's report.
[1:36:07.520 --> 1:36:10.400]  People are asking me on social media, well, where are you finding this?
[1:36:10.400 --> 1:36:13.880]  And what doctor said that he died of a lethal amount of fentanyl and meth in his system?
[1:36:13.880 --> 1:36:15.320]  People, it's right there on the internet.
[1:36:15.320 --> 1:36:20.600]  The entire Hennepin County medical examiner's report that specifically says that George Floyd
[1:36:20.600 --> 1:36:22.780]  had no bruising in his neck area.
[1:36:22.780 --> 1:36:24.400]  He had no lacerations.
[1:36:24.400 --> 1:36:27.960]  He had no indication of blunt force trauma to the trachea or anywhere that would have
[1:36:27.960 --> 1:36:31.960]  affected his breathing, nothing from the knee, nothing from the dragging, nothing from the
[1:36:31.960 --> 1:36:33.320]  putting in the squad car.
[1:36:33.320 --> 1:36:37.160]  The only marks that he had on him that were consistent with being arrested was from hand
[1:36:37.160 --> 1:36:38.160]  restraints.
[1:36:38.160 --> 1:36:42.360]  And they were typical of hand restraints, i.e. handcuffs that are used to handcuff anybody
[1:36:42.360 --> 1:36:43.360]  that goes to jail.
[1:36:43.360 --> 1:36:45.560]  I mean, he died of a fentanyl overdose.
[1:36:45.560 --> 1:36:47.000]  He died of a fentanyl overdose.
[1:36:47.000 --> 1:36:48.000]  His heart blew up.
[1:36:48.000 --> 1:36:49.440]  He had a lethal amount of fentanyl.
[1:36:49.440 --> 1:36:52.960]  Those are words that come verbatim from the medical examiner from the medical examiner.
[1:36:52.960 --> 1:36:55.600]  Didn't they say it was like double or triple the number that would kill somebody?
[1:36:55.600 --> 1:37:00.080]  It would have killed three people, the amount of meth and fentanyl that he had in his system.
[1:37:00.080 --> 1:37:03.840]  Whether he had contact with a cop that day or not, George Floyd was going to die.
[1:37:03.840 --> 1:37:06.080]  I just feel sorry for the police because I see it here in Austin.
[1:37:06.080 --> 1:37:07.080]  They're like janitors.
[1:37:07.080 --> 1:37:10.600]  They have to run around behind all these drug addicts, black, white, you name it, attacking
[1:37:10.600 --> 1:37:11.600]  them all day.
[1:37:11.600 --> 1:37:12.600]  I would never do that job.
[1:37:12.600 --> 1:37:15.480]  I know you just have a couple of seconds left, but let me just ask the question.
[1:37:15.480 --> 1:37:19.480]  So does this mean now that we're going to target and go after every single cop and charge
[1:37:19.480 --> 1:37:23.520]  them with murder if they had contact with somebody today who later today dies of a fentanyl
[1:37:23.520 --> 1:37:24.520]  or meth overdose?
[1:37:24.520 --> 1:37:25.520]  Did they use excessive force?
[1:37:25.520 --> 1:37:28.960]  Well, this is designed to make society totally disintegrate.
[1:37:28.960 --> 1:37:29.960]  Stay there.
[1:37:29.960 --> 1:37:32.440]  Ladies and gentlemen, Scoot Peters is our guest.
[1:37:32.440 --> 1:37:35.040]  I'm Alex Jones with infowars.com and newswars.com.
[1:37:35.040 --> 1:37:36.040]  This site's redvoicemedia.com.
[1:37:36.040 --> 1:37:37.480]  This is a great show daily.
[1:37:37.480 --> 1:37:42.920]  They'll be right back on the other side to talk about the inoculations, all of this and
[1:37:42.920 --> 1:37:44.080]  the police state around inoculations.
[1:37:44.080 --> 1:37:52.880]  If you want a police state, you're getting one, we'll be right back.
[1:37:52.880 --> 1:37:55.960]  Humanity has been domesticated by and large.
[1:37:55.960 --> 1:38:00.120]  The population has been trained to submit, do what you're told, and it's all going to
[1:38:00.120 --> 1:38:01.120]  pass.
[1:38:01.120 --> 1:38:04.360]  But if you study authoritarians, if you study the globalists, you understand that they reach
[1:38:04.360 --> 1:38:08.560]  a point where all the training is just beta and you go into the point of being cold, being
[1:38:08.560 --> 1:38:09.560]  totally enslaved.
[1:38:09.560 --> 1:38:13.360]  And because the globalists see us as weak and see us as stupid, they are now making
[1:38:13.360 --> 1:38:14.360]  that move.
[1:38:14.360 --> 1:38:18.320]  And they are collapsing the third world with their economic weapons to then flood us with
[1:38:18.320 --> 1:38:24.040]  the third world that the UN will use as a weapon to then have us under such a crisis,
[1:38:24.040 --> 1:38:28.960]  under such a load, capitulate to the UN, whatever agreements they want us to sign, hoping that
[1:38:28.960 --> 1:38:34.600]  they will stop the flood of tens of millions of refugees, not fleeing COVID or climate
[1:38:34.600 --> 1:38:39.200]  change as the UN and Klaus Schwab are saying and Bill Gates is saying, but fleeing the
[1:38:39.200 --> 1:38:45.200]  year long lockdowns that the UN and Bill Gates ordered them to institute or they wouldn't
[1:38:45.200 --> 1:38:48.160]  get more IMF and World Bank money.
[1:38:48.160 --> 1:38:52.160]  And that's why we have to really get educated about the globalist.
[1:38:52.160 --> 1:38:55.600]  I don't like coming to you and saying this could be our last broadcast.
[1:38:55.600 --> 1:38:59.800]  I've been on there 27 years and only the last year or so have I said that.
[1:38:59.800 --> 1:39:03.000]  But let me tell you, the new world orders breathe them down our neck.
[1:39:03.000 --> 1:39:06.120]  The big globalist publications are coming after us and they're doing everything they
[1:39:06.120 --> 1:39:07.400]  can to shut us down.
[1:39:07.400 --> 1:39:11.720]  So please pray to keep Info Wars on the air and please support the local states you're
[1:39:11.720 --> 1:39:12.720]  listening to as well.
[1:39:12.720 --> 1:39:18.840]  At the same time, go to infowarstore.com while you still can and get a book, get a film,
[1:39:18.840 --> 1:39:23.720]  get a t-shirt, get some supplements because it's that money that helps us stay on air
[1:39:23.720 --> 1:39:25.200]  in the face of this thing.
[1:39:25.200 --> 1:39:27.320]  I need your help more than ever now.
[1:39:27.320 --> 1:39:31.640]  I want to keep fighting the globalist, but I can't do it if you don't support us.
[1:39:31.640 --> 1:39:37.040]  So pray for us, word of mouth, tell folks about the broadcast however you can and buy great
[1:39:37.040 --> 1:39:42.280]  products that will enrich you and your family's lives every day at infowarstore.com.
[1:39:42.280 --> 1:39:47.040]  Whether it's high quality coffee, for supplements or books or films, all of it nurtures the
[1:39:47.040 --> 1:39:51.880]  soul, all of it empowers humanity, all of it is pro-human and pro-God.
[1:39:51.880 --> 1:39:54.600]  Thank you so much.
[1:39:54.600 --> 1:40:00.120]  Every product you hear me on air advertising, we have it stocked in our warehouse in Austin,
[1:40:00.120 --> 1:40:01.120]  Texas.
[1:40:01.120 --> 1:40:02.120]  Every product.
[1:40:02.120 --> 1:40:05.000]  So if you order it, we've got it shipped out in a couple of days, sometimes the same
[1:40:05.000 --> 1:40:06.000]  day.
[1:40:06.000 --> 1:40:09.680]  The future is to get confused when they hear me talk about the fact that the supply chain
[1:40:09.680 --> 1:40:15.520]  is breaking down and its future orders, its product we're trying to reorder to get back
[1:40:15.520 --> 1:40:17.800]  in that we're having trouble with.
[1:40:17.800 --> 1:40:23.600]  I mean, I'm talking about double, triple, quadruple delivery times and it's across not
[1:40:23.600 --> 1:40:26.960]  just the supplement, vitamin, mineral industry, it's across every industry.
[1:40:26.960 --> 1:40:31.760]  So the globalists have successfully devastated the economy.
[1:40:31.760 --> 1:40:32.760]  That's what I'm saying.
[1:40:32.760 --> 1:40:36.360]  You need to visit infoorstore.com today and get high quality supplements while you still
[1:40:36.360 --> 1:40:42.440]  can and storeable food at infoorstore.com because we have it in stock, it's ready to ship.
[1:40:42.440 --> 1:40:47.360]  But with the supply chain breakdowns, prices are going up, availability is going down and
[1:40:47.360 --> 1:40:48.480]  it's just crazy.
[1:40:48.480 --> 1:40:54.240]  So please get products while you still can and support the infoorstore.com.
[1:40:54.240 --> 1:40:58.960]  The people are awakening, they're taking control of their own environment.
[1:40:58.960 --> 1:41:00.240]  Cell phones are an amazing tool.
[1:41:00.240 --> 1:41:03.040]  Really, they're a supercomputer that's handheld.
[1:41:03.040 --> 1:41:07.520]  But big tech, large corporations, hackers, governments, foreign governments, the CHICOMS
[1:41:07.520 --> 1:41:14.080]  especially are using this to steal your data, to share your data, to be able to rig markets
[1:41:14.080 --> 1:41:18.080]  when they're able to scoop up billions of people's data that can actually predict on
[1:41:18.080 --> 1:41:21.320]  record what's going to happen in mass movements.
[1:41:21.320 --> 1:41:27.880]  Cutting them out of that data stream absolutely devastates their AI takeover.
[1:41:27.880 --> 1:41:29.240]  In their own words, they admit it.
[1:41:29.240 --> 1:41:34.280]  So I've been selling privacy pouches and pocket-pockets and things like that for more than a decade.
[1:41:34.280 --> 1:41:37.760]  And now the units have gotten really lightweight, they're Faraday cages, they just look like
[1:41:37.760 --> 1:41:42.680]  a cloth envelope, they work absolutely great and it just gives you that security to have
[1:41:42.680 --> 1:41:47.760]  power over your data and power over your identity when you are traveling and don't want big
[1:41:47.760 --> 1:41:50.120]  brother to know what you're up to because it's not their business.
[1:41:50.120 --> 1:41:56.240]  Get yours at infoorstore.com today.
[1:41:56.240 --> 1:42:06.400]  You are listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:42:06.400 --> 1:42:11.320]  You are listening to an infowars.com frontline report.
[1:42:11.320 --> 1:42:16.120]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[1:42:16.120 --> 1:42:22.080]  We now take you live.
[1:42:22.080 --> 1:42:34.080]  From the infowars.com studios in the recaptured state of Texas, it's Alex Jones and Stu Peters
[1:42:34.080 --> 1:42:35.080]  of Red Voice Media.
[1:42:35.080 --> 1:42:38.080]  I'm Alex Jones again of infowars.com.
[1:42:38.080 --> 1:42:45.200]  We have Stuart Rhodes who they're trying to set up for the capital event on January 6th
[1:42:45.200 --> 1:42:46.200]  joining us.
[1:42:46.200 --> 1:42:50.360]  We have Mike Adams breaking down this big site of reported naturalnews.com.
[1:42:50.360 --> 1:42:55.960]  Not vaccine scientists warn the world, hold all COVID-19 vaccinations immediately or uncontrolled
[1:42:55.960 --> 1:42:58.160]  monster will be unleashed.
[1:42:58.160 --> 1:43:06.400]  But throughout history, we have seen children by the Toltecs and the Olmecs and the Aztecs
[1:43:06.400 --> 1:43:10.840]  and by the Babylonians and by the Druids and by every group goes through cycles where
[1:43:10.840 --> 1:43:15.160]  children give their parents over to have their hearts cut out or to be burned or to be skinned
[1:43:15.160 --> 1:43:19.160]  alive or to be ground to different gods.
[1:43:19.160 --> 1:43:25.120]  Now we have the textbooks coming out in California teaching children to pray for the winged serpent
[1:43:25.120 --> 1:43:31.720]  which I'm saying that wrong, I probably am, which they would sacrifice boys to and they
[1:43:31.720 --> 1:43:32.720]  say this is good.
[1:43:32.720 --> 1:43:33.720]  The earth needs blood.
[1:43:33.720 --> 1:43:37.000]  To the left is just going back to pagan ideology.
[1:43:37.000 --> 1:43:38.000]  They're very anti-Christian.
[1:43:38.000 --> 1:43:42.560]  And so here's the latest on infowars.com even though these are experimental vaccines not
[1:43:42.560 --> 1:43:43.560]  even properly approved.
[1:43:43.560 --> 1:43:47.760]  They're just giving executive power to be approved by Dr. Biden and Dr. Gates.
[1:43:47.760 --> 1:43:53.680]  Look, parents volunteering their babies and young children to test Moderna's COVID vaccine.
[1:43:53.680 --> 1:43:57.680]  It says it's liberals that are doing it in the article and the parents are bringing their
[1:43:57.680 --> 1:44:01.080]  children saying they want it, they want it now, even if you believe in the overblown
[1:44:01.080 --> 1:44:02.080]  COVID-19.
[1:44:02.080 --> 1:44:08.680]  That even if you contracted 99.7% chance you get over it, but you've got a 99.99999, you
[1:44:08.680 --> 1:44:10.960]  aren't going to get it.
[1:44:10.960 --> 1:44:16.880]  Children don't need this and it's dangerous, but oh, it's a sacrament of your wokeness.
[1:44:16.880 --> 1:44:19.360]  They're on the news going, Republicans don't believe it.
[1:44:19.360 --> 1:44:20.360]  They don't want it.
[1:44:20.360 --> 1:44:21.360]  So they want the shot.
[1:44:21.360 --> 1:44:22.360]  Republicans don't want mass.
[1:44:22.360 --> 1:44:24.000]  So we've got to have the mass forever.
[1:44:24.000 --> 1:44:28.320]  They have gotten the left to do anything they're told as long as it's like they're pro war
[1:44:28.320 --> 1:44:32.240]  now, they're pro torture, they're pro get rid of the dollar, they're pro burn the country
[1:44:32.240 --> 1:44:34.680]  down because they're so woke.
[1:44:34.680 --> 1:44:36.680]  What do you say about this?
[1:44:36.680 --> 1:44:41.520]  Oh, I mean, I had to pick up my son today from school.
[1:44:41.520 --> 1:44:43.080]  He is nine years old.
[1:44:43.080 --> 1:44:44.400]  He's a third grader.
[1:44:44.400 --> 1:44:47.280]  He was involved with a hockey tournament over the weekend.
[1:44:47.280 --> 1:44:52.160]  And apparently one of the players in this tournament had the world ending plague, you
[1:44:52.160 --> 1:44:53.680]  know, the Rona.
[1:44:53.680 --> 1:44:57.880]  And by the way, we've now eliminated kids as being these super spreaders that they tried
[1:44:57.880 --> 1:45:01.440]  to fear us into what was going to happen, right?
[1:45:01.440 --> 1:45:07.920]  But I have to go pick him up despite the fact that these kids are exerting themselves wearing
[1:45:07.920 --> 1:45:08.920]  masks.
[1:45:08.920 --> 1:45:11.880]  I mean, it's absolutely devastating to let them play organization.
[1:45:11.880 --> 1:45:16.000]  I don't really know a whole lot about them, but what a, so this is not an endorsement.
[1:45:16.000 --> 1:45:21.080]  But what I'm seeing from them so far, I really like, I mean, these kids are exerting themselves
[1:45:21.080 --> 1:45:26.400]  Alex while wearing a mask that prohibits them from exhaling what your body is designed
[1:45:26.400 --> 1:45:27.400]  to get rid of.
[1:45:27.400 --> 1:45:31.000]  I mean, why don't they just wrap their lips around my tailpipe every morning before I
[1:45:31.000 --> 1:45:36.120]  take them, you know, and this, this carbon dioxide and this, this, I mean, and their
[1:45:36.120 --> 1:45:42.480]  heart rates are elevated, the long term effects that this is going to have on our children
[1:45:42.480 --> 1:45:47.080]  physically is just absolutely a travesty.
[1:45:47.080 --> 1:45:52.760]  And we haven't even really talked about the unprecedented amount of youth suicides, attempted
[1:45:52.760 --> 1:45:58.880]  suicides, depression, the pills, the chemicals that doctors are prescribing at nauseam that
[1:45:58.880 --> 1:46:03.040]  are shoving down the throats of these kids who are being diagnosed with early onsets
[1:46:03.040 --> 1:46:04.040]  of depression.
[1:46:04.040 --> 1:46:08.320]  They're labeling it ADHD, they're labeling it oppositional defiant disorder.
[1:46:08.320 --> 1:46:12.680]  Oh, the truth is that much more dying from not getting cancer treated or heart attacks.
[1:46:12.680 --> 1:46:15.720]  And they know all the insurance companies are getting their money, but nobody's allowed
[1:46:15.720 --> 1:46:19.240]  to go to the doctor because it's nonessential healthcare, getting their checkups.
[1:46:19.240 --> 1:46:21.560]  This is a cult brainwashing takeover.
[1:46:21.560 --> 1:46:25.360]  So again, what do you make of the left as a sacrament saying they want to take their
[1:46:25.360 --> 1:46:28.240]  children to be inoculated with experimental vaccines?
[1:46:28.240 --> 1:46:29.960]  Why do they take them to drag queen story time?
[1:46:29.960 --> 1:46:33.920]  Well, I guess they didn't abort them in the looms, so they want to abort them now.
[1:46:33.920 --> 1:46:38.120]  All what they're doing is they're castrating their minds, and they're aborting them while
[1:46:38.120 --> 1:46:39.360]  they're alive mentally.
[1:46:39.360 --> 1:46:43.640]  They're mentally killing them, they're taking them over because they know.
[1:46:43.640 --> 1:46:48.080]  They know that they're not going to convince you and they're not going to convince me.
[1:46:48.080 --> 1:46:49.080]  We are too strong.
[1:46:49.080 --> 1:46:52.640]  We are the lions that are at the top of the church steeple with these bullhorns that we
[1:46:52.640 --> 1:46:57.120]  call microphones here, broadcasting our truth to the world as long as those people behind
[1:46:57.120 --> 1:47:00.840]  that camera allow me to be here and you to be there, we will be here.
[1:47:00.840 --> 1:47:01.840]  And nobody's ever going to change our mind.
[1:47:01.840 --> 1:47:05.240]  Who are the real criminals here, not just Bill Gates, not just Fauci, not just Schwab
[1:47:05.240 --> 1:47:09.040]  admitting it's a power grab, a corporate world government, big pharma takeover.
[1:47:09.040 --> 1:47:11.520]  It's also all the enablers in it.
[1:47:11.520 --> 1:47:15.920]  It's big tech and mainstream media that suppress medical doctors and scientists and researchers
[1:47:15.920 --> 1:47:16.920]  and the facts.
[1:47:16.920 --> 1:47:20.680]  I mean, people putting out mainline news that these vaccines are getting banned around the
[1:47:20.680 --> 1:47:21.680]  world.
[1:47:21.680 --> 1:47:25.160]  All of them have been banned in different places are being suppressed and they're saying that's
[1:47:25.160 --> 1:47:27.000]  not official UN news.
[1:47:27.000 --> 1:47:31.640]  You're only allowed to have the WHO since when did we wake up in the UN's in charge of everything?
[1:47:31.640 --> 1:47:33.560]  I mean, this is insane.
[1:47:33.560 --> 1:47:39.680]  We've had virologists, we've had epidemiologists, we've had actual real medical expert doctors
[1:47:39.680 --> 1:47:45.080]  that have come on my program to talk about the vaccination and it gets banned from everywhere.
[1:47:45.080 --> 1:47:47.240]  The truth is not permitted to come out.
[1:47:47.240 --> 1:47:53.800]  And so the inoculation, if you will, or the castration or the abortion of live brains
[1:47:53.800 --> 1:47:59.480]  has to happen in order for them to choke out every last remaining pro police, pro America,
[1:47:59.480 --> 1:48:05.120]  first patriot, conservative, specifically, God fearing Christian in this country, especially
[1:48:05.120 --> 1:48:09.360]  if you're a white male with a penis, you're done.
[1:48:09.360 --> 1:48:13.960]  So they're not going to convince you or me, so they have to do it in the classroom.
[1:48:13.960 --> 1:48:18.160]  God's greatest gift is our children and they are attacking our kids as proven.
[1:48:18.160 --> 1:48:23.760]  Now, here's another example, Governor Tim Jong-Wals in Minnesota, the radical loony
[1:48:23.760 --> 1:48:29.360]  tune who has extended his peacetime emergency powers for an unprecedented over a year now,
[1:48:29.360 --> 1:48:32.360]  which was designed for something completely different than have anything to do with COVID.
[1:48:32.360 --> 1:48:35.520]  Obviously, it wasn't intended for these purposes, but they're abusing it.
[1:48:35.520 --> 1:48:36.520]  And he's not the only one.
[1:48:36.520 --> 1:48:40.040]  We've seen these radical governors all over the place, but this guy actually approved
[1:48:40.040 --> 1:48:42.000]  a children's audio video book.
[1:48:42.000 --> 1:48:47.680]  Now get this, a book that teaches kids that all cops are racist murderers.
[1:48:47.680 --> 1:48:51.640]  This is actually being used specifically in school district number 196, which is like
[1:48:51.640 --> 1:48:56.040]  Apple Valley, Rose Mount, you know, the Silver Spoon area of well to do children for the
[1:48:56.040 --> 1:48:57.440]  most part.
[1:48:57.440 --> 1:49:01.560]  These kids are being told in an audio video book narrated by some underprivileged black
[1:49:01.560 --> 1:49:06.120]  guy who, by the way, happens to be a doctor himself, a professor married to a doctor.
[1:49:06.120 --> 1:49:08.320]  Both of his parents were doctors and he never paid for anything.
[1:49:08.320 --> 1:49:09.320]  The guys probably never even did it.
[1:49:09.320 --> 1:49:14.060]  And it doesn't matter that the main top nine income groups in the U.S. are Asian, then
[1:49:14.060 --> 1:49:15.060]  whites under that.
[1:49:15.060 --> 1:49:16.060]  It's all crap.
[1:49:16.060 --> 1:49:19.440]  Whites are a tiny minority worldwide of like seven percent.
[1:49:19.440 --> 1:49:23.480]  They're just teaching groups to attack a group to be authoritarian so that a bunch of billionaire
[1:49:23.480 --> 1:49:27.620]  globalists can sit offshore and not pay taxes while we all kill each other.
[1:49:27.620 --> 1:49:29.120]  You are totally right.
[1:49:29.120 --> 1:49:34.280]  Meanwhile, a professor warns post-corona society is a national obedience contest.
[1:49:34.280 --> 1:49:39.040]  How do we reach out to leftists and others that are under this mind control in this
[1:49:39.040 --> 1:49:40.040]  crance?
[1:49:40.040 --> 1:49:41.040]  How do we get them out of it, Stu Peters?
[1:49:41.040 --> 1:49:43.920]  Oh, man, I don't know that you do.
[1:49:43.920 --> 1:49:47.720]  I mean, there are some cases where you just have to look at somebody and write them off
[1:49:47.720 --> 1:49:49.120]  because they're just too far gone.
[1:49:49.120 --> 1:49:52.120]  I mean, you deal with this with addictions all the time.
[1:49:52.120 --> 1:49:54.720]  You know, I mean, I agree, but they've got corporate backing.
[1:49:54.720 --> 1:50:00.080]  They've got the left are just following the global corporate religion of mindlessness
[1:50:00.080 --> 1:50:02.320]  and PC anti-human garbage.
[1:50:02.320 --> 1:50:04.320]  How do we wake them up if they're in a cult?
[1:50:04.320 --> 1:50:05.960]  I guess you're saying we can't.
[1:50:05.960 --> 1:50:07.200]  I mean, yeah, I don't think you can.
[1:50:07.200 --> 1:50:08.200]  I mean, look at this.
[1:50:08.200 --> 1:50:09.520]  I mean, look at this Milgram experiment.
[1:50:09.520 --> 1:50:10.520]  If you're ready, Alyssa, you're missing.
[1:50:10.520 --> 1:50:11.760]  This is all evil.
[1:50:11.760 --> 1:50:14.560]  This is this is seeing what they can get us to do.
[1:50:14.560 --> 1:50:15.800]  This is a hundred percent satanic.
[1:50:15.800 --> 1:50:18.320]  Well, let's just see if we can get them to take the vaccine.
[1:50:18.320 --> 1:50:23.240]  I mean, the vaccine is not even a vaccine, first of all, it's a it's a substance.
[1:50:23.240 --> 1:50:27.600]  It's a cocktail that convinces your body, tricks your body and your immune system into believing
[1:50:27.600 --> 1:50:29.600]  that you have COVID all the time.
[1:50:29.600 --> 1:50:34.160]  I mean, imagine the habit that this is wreaking on the inside of your body.
[1:50:34.160 --> 1:50:35.160]  Hey, Stu, Peter's.
[1:50:35.160 --> 1:50:36.160]  I'm impressed.
[1:50:36.160 --> 1:50:37.160]  You're a smart guy.
[1:50:37.160 --> 1:50:41.120]  We love your red voice media.com and we love your show and we love it when you join us.
[1:50:41.120 --> 1:50:42.120]  Join us again soon.
[1:50:42.120 --> 1:50:43.120]  And thank you.
[1:50:43.120 --> 1:50:44.120]  I will.
[1:50:44.120 --> 1:50:45.120]  Thanks a lot for having me.
[1:50:45.120 --> 1:50:46.120]  Oh, wow.
[1:50:46.120 --> 1:50:47.120]  That was amazing.
[1:50:47.120 --> 1:50:48.120]  It's all true too.
[1:50:48.120 --> 1:50:53.880]  I love using useful idiots following a woke ideology or just NPCs, but I don't hate them.
[1:50:53.880 --> 1:50:59.720]  I don't hate the FBI coming out saying white people are the enemy and America's bad.
[1:50:59.720 --> 1:51:02.960]  That's a cult that's been captured, but it doesn't mean I'm going to submit to it.
[1:51:02.960 --> 1:51:04.960]  But let me tell you, the real enemy is Bill Gates.
[1:51:04.960 --> 1:51:05.960]  It is Fauci.
[1:51:05.960 --> 1:51:10.880]  It's these guys that are exterminating brown people worldwide that are shutting off with
[1:51:10.880 --> 1:51:12.720]  the COVID lockdown starving tens of millions.
[1:51:12.720 --> 1:51:15.320]  They're like, well, they're killing tens of millions with the left hand.
[1:51:15.320 --> 1:51:18.280]  They're got to pop it with the right hand going, look, I love George Floyd.
[1:51:18.280 --> 1:51:19.280]  I care about him.
[1:51:19.280 --> 1:51:20.280]  It's crazy.
[1:51:20.280 --> 1:51:21.280]  All right.
[1:51:21.280 --> 1:51:23.400]  We've got Stuart Rhodes and Mike Adams coming up.
[1:51:23.400 --> 1:51:26.960]  Mike Adams first with just over the top news with the top scientists and we're talking
[1:51:26.960 --> 1:51:32.760]  top, top, top saying this vaccine is a chemical bio weapon and implants viral strains in your
[1:51:32.760 --> 1:51:34.320]  body to basically offshed them.
[1:51:34.320 --> 1:51:36.640]  And that's what the other literature I was just reading is saying.
[1:51:36.640 --> 1:51:39.480]  So this is just as bad as we thought it was.
[1:51:39.480 --> 1:51:40.480]  It's all coming up.
[1:51:40.480 --> 1:51:41.480]  Please keep us on air.
[1:51:41.480 --> 1:51:42.760]  Please spread the word about the broadcast.
[1:51:42.760 --> 1:51:47.800]  Storewide free shipping at infowarstore.com ends this Thursday morning.
[1:51:47.800 --> 1:51:48.800]  It will end.
[1:51:48.800 --> 1:51:49.800]  Storewide free shipping.
[1:51:49.800 --> 1:51:54.880]  We've got 40, 50% off the Creole oil and all the other great products.
[1:51:54.880 --> 1:51:58.520]  The X2 50% off, ultra 12, high quality V12 out of the tongue.
[1:51:58.520 --> 1:52:02.320]  That's 50% off infowarstore.com.

[1:52:06.680 --> 1:52:11.920]  the privacy pockets that little Faraday cages for your cell phones and back in stock.
[1:52:11.920 --> 1:52:16.840]  Your cell will continue on Thursday 50% off brain force plus our amazing powerful effective
[1:52:16.840 --> 1:52:24.600]  clean brain boost support at infowarstore.com 50% off and free shipping on that will continue
[1:52:24.600 --> 1:52:26.640]  because we've got a big shipment in.
[1:52:26.640 --> 1:52:29.840]  But again, get some t shirts while you're there as well.
[1:52:29.840 --> 1:52:31.360]  We're away from America coffee.
[1:52:31.360 --> 1:52:33.920]  That's what teaches operation in attack formation.
[1:52:33.920 --> 1:52:39.560]  Now our number three with the health ranger Mike Adams and Stuart Rose straight ahead.
[1:52:39.560 --> 1:52:45.880]  Anyway, listeners ask me all the time, why do you have multiple multivitamins?
[1:52:45.880 --> 1:52:48.520]  Why do you have multiple high quality iodine?
[1:52:48.520 --> 1:52:49.520]  Why do you do that?
[1:52:49.520 --> 1:52:51.720]  Because different strokes for different folks.
[1:52:51.720 --> 1:52:56.160]  If we're talking to researchers and scientists and they say, hey, a lot of people love deep
[1:52:56.160 --> 1:53:00.160]  earth pure crystal iodine, but you should put one out with deeper crystal iodine and
[1:53:00.160 --> 1:53:03.280]  the two other types because some people can't absorb pure iodine.
[1:53:03.280 --> 1:53:04.280]  Boom.
[1:53:04.280 --> 1:53:05.280]  We did it.
[1:53:05.280 --> 1:53:06.280]  It's popular.
[1:53:06.280 --> 1:53:07.280]  It's X3.
[1:53:07.280 --> 1:53:08.280]  Is it better than X2?
[1:53:08.280 --> 1:53:09.280]  You decide.
[1:53:09.280 --> 1:53:14.880]  And now we have a compliment to knock out our very popular powdered pill sleeping.
[1:53:14.880 --> 1:53:16.320]  And that is down and out.
[1:53:16.320 --> 1:53:21.200]  It's super strong, way stronger than knock out, but they don't compete with each other.
[1:53:21.200 --> 1:53:26.000]  Different strokes for different folks, different formulas, and it's 40% off out of the gates
[1:53:26.000 --> 1:53:28.400]  at mforestore.com and free shipping.
[1:53:28.400 --> 1:53:29.400]  Secure your down and out today.
[1:53:29.400 --> 1:53:32.760]  And while you're sleeping, you know you're funding the M4 at the same time, down and
[1:53:32.760 --> 1:53:43.360]  out exclusively available at mforestore.com or 40% off and for shipping.
[1:53:43.360 --> 1:53:52.360]  In the early 1990s, it was a really funny movie that came out called Wayne's World.
[1:53:52.360 --> 1:53:56.600]  Even before I had an access to the show in the mid-1990s, I wouldn't call that movie
[1:53:56.600 --> 1:53:58.040]  and thought, man, that was fun.
[1:53:58.040 --> 1:54:01.120]  In fact, you speak out and have your own ideas.
[1:54:01.120 --> 1:54:03.840]  Even if you're a nerd, you're still entertaining because you're real.
[1:54:03.840 --> 1:54:05.880]  Well, what do they say in Wayne's World?
[1:54:05.880 --> 1:54:07.360]  We're not worthy.
[1:54:07.360 --> 1:54:09.800]  We're not worthy.
[1:54:09.800 --> 1:54:13.680]  Every day when I cover these huge topics, I don't feel worthy to talk to you because
[1:54:13.680 --> 1:54:15.640]  these topics are so huge, they're so real.
[1:54:15.640 --> 1:54:16.880]  But I'm trying to tell you the truth.
[1:54:16.880 --> 1:54:19.040]  I'm trying to get it right, and most of the time we do.
[1:54:19.040 --> 1:54:20.680]  The globalists love lying to you.
[1:54:20.680 --> 1:54:22.040]  They love manipulating you.
[1:54:22.040 --> 1:54:24.680]  They enjoy destroying humanity.
[1:54:24.680 --> 1:54:29.480]  They enjoy manipulating ideas and using people's ignorance against them.
[1:54:29.480 --> 1:54:32.200]  And for me, it's really set down and disgusting.
[1:54:32.200 --> 1:54:38.080]  So you've got to pledge for myself and the whole InfoWars crew that we will never join
[1:54:38.080 --> 1:54:39.080]  the globalists.
[1:54:39.080 --> 1:54:46.200]  We will never knowingly manipulate you because we know we're all in this together.
[1:54:46.200 --> 1:54:49.200]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[1:54:49.200 --> 1:55:12.040]  Now, we're about to lay out some incredible information.
[1:55:12.040 --> 1:55:17.560]  There are so many prestigious doctors, so many prestigious scientists, that on an hourly
[1:55:17.560 --> 1:55:20.600]  basis come out, it just makes your head spin.
[1:55:20.600 --> 1:55:25.920]  Kelly McBreen last week at infowars.com wrote the article, doctors issued dire warnings
[1:55:25.920 --> 1:55:28.360]  about COVID-19 vaccine dangers.
[1:55:28.360 --> 1:55:31.360]  And then we go into some of that and then link to the paper.
[1:55:31.360 --> 1:55:36.520]  But Mike Adams has put out a more detailed report, getting into what Gret Van den Bosch
[1:55:36.520 --> 1:55:40.120]  actually said and who he is and how prestigious he is.
[1:55:40.120 --> 1:55:44.680]  And then separately, when I saw this this morning, I was already reading another big
[1:55:44.680 --> 1:55:51.040]  report from three years ago out of a prestigious cancer research institute about mRNA really
[1:55:51.040 --> 1:55:52.040]  being viruses.
[1:55:52.040 --> 1:55:56.160]  That's the same thing as information that's the main cause of cancer that really DNA doesn't
[1:55:56.160 --> 1:56:01.320]  ever produce cancer and that it's mRNA, RNA getting in that does it.
[1:56:01.320 --> 1:56:04.120]  And that that's why these scientists are saying it's going to cause massive cancer.
[1:56:04.120 --> 1:56:09.320]  So Mike's got the big article at naturalnews.com, it's a big thick one, it went deep into this.
[1:56:09.320 --> 1:56:15.000]  Stop vaccine scientists warns the world, halt all COVID-19 vaccinations immediately or uncontrollable
[1:56:15.000 --> 1:56:17.040]  monster will be unleashed.
[1:56:17.040 --> 1:56:20.400]  Some stations don't carry this segment, some do, we're going to recap next segment.
[1:56:20.400 --> 1:56:22.840]  But Mike Adams, the health range are good to have you here.
[1:56:22.840 --> 1:56:24.720]  This is just getting worse and worse by the minute.
[1:56:24.720 --> 1:56:27.520]  Well, thanks for having me on, Alex.
[1:56:27.520 --> 1:56:32.560]  What's the bombshell about this is that through this fast vaccination vaccination program,
[1:56:32.560 --> 1:56:38.040]  they've been able to turn human beings into bio weapons factories.
[1:56:38.040 --> 1:56:43.640]  That's what Dr. Bosch is essentially laying out in his outstanding public presentation
[1:56:43.640 --> 1:56:44.640]  PDF file.
[1:56:44.640 --> 1:56:50.600]  So what's happening is people, remember Dr. Bosch says the vaccine in his view does work
[1:56:50.600 --> 1:56:55.760]  but specifically only against the very weak strain of COVID that has become essentially
[1:56:55.760 --> 1:56:59.440]  harmless because of natural host adaptation.
[1:56:59.440 --> 1:57:05.640]  But at the same time that vaccine is then breeding superbugs in human bodies in the
[1:57:05.640 --> 1:57:11.840]  same way that antibiotics breed superbugs in a hospital setting and then those people
[1:57:11.840 --> 1:57:18.000]  who are breeding those superbugs end up shedding those superbugs and then distributing new deadly
[1:57:18.000 --> 1:57:23.560]  strains that are far more deadly than the original SARS-CoV-2 strain, which as I said
[1:57:23.560 --> 1:57:26.020]  is essentially harmless at this point.
[1:57:26.020 --> 1:57:30.140]  So the vaccine industry has figured out a way where they don't have to build the bio
[1:57:30.140 --> 1:57:31.400]  weapon.
[1:57:31.400 --> 1:57:36.120]  They can get human beings to do it and they're using the vaccine as the pressure to make
[1:57:36.120 --> 1:57:37.120]  that happen.
[1:57:37.120 --> 1:57:43.520]  So what we have coming for 2021 and 2022, it's going to make 2020 look like a picnic.
[1:57:43.520 --> 1:57:44.520]  That's right.
[1:57:44.520 --> 1:57:47.000]  And that's what a lot of others find, as I said, is this is really a virus.
[1:57:47.000 --> 1:57:52.600]  A lot of these vaccines, these viral vector viruses are vaccines that use a virus.
[1:57:52.600 --> 1:57:58.960]  This also acts as a virus that manipulates the outside of the cell but controls the inside.
[1:57:58.960 --> 1:58:02.640]  And obviously they've tested all of this on a lot of other animals before under other
[1:58:02.640 --> 1:58:05.720]  vaccine trials when they claim they're skipping animal trials because they don't want you
[1:58:05.720 --> 1:58:07.400]  to see what happens with the animal.
[1:58:07.400 --> 1:58:08.400]  Stay right there.
[1:58:08.400 --> 1:58:13.040]  Mike Adams, we're going to come back to you on the other side and clean up his audio or
[1:58:13.040 --> 1:58:17.360]  our audio a little bit because what he's saying is absolutely so critical.
[1:58:17.360 --> 1:58:18.840]  This could not be bigger.
[1:58:18.840 --> 1:58:22.520]  This is a prestigious top vaccine scientist.
[1:58:22.520 --> 1:58:23.840]  This is life and death.
[1:58:23.840 --> 1:58:24.840]  This is the facts.
[1:58:24.840 --> 1:58:26.200]  This is the science.
[1:58:26.200 --> 1:58:31.440]  Not what Bill Gates, not what the zombie Joe Biden is telling you, but the realities.
[1:58:31.440 --> 1:58:37.280]  We're going to go right back to what he just said and recap this on the other side.
[1:58:37.280 --> 1:58:42.000]  I'm begging you for the sake of my family, your family and humanity.
[1:58:42.000 --> 1:58:47.160]  Please, please, please, please tell everybody about the local station you're listening to
[1:58:47.160 --> 1:58:49.200]  and send people the links to the live feed.
[1:58:49.200 --> 1:58:53.640]  That's at infowars.com and newswars.com and Bandai Video because that's how we get around
[1:58:53.640 --> 1:58:55.480]  the sensors and that's how we save lives.
[1:58:55.480 --> 1:58:59.360]  I've got all the articles about how we're all going to be infertile and Politico celebrating
[1:58:59.360 --> 1:59:04.600]  it and how all the humans will be dead soon and they're admitting this.
[1:59:04.600 --> 1:59:08.680]  This is a group of sick crazies that don't want to go to the beach and have a big crowd.
[1:59:08.680 --> 1:59:14.400]  They want to get rid of people and it's just a total excuse for total extermination.
[1:59:14.400 --> 1:59:19.400]  It's Hitler 2.0 by stealth and that's why they're telling you, oh, we've got to burn
[1:59:19.400 --> 1:59:20.400]  down the city.
[1:59:20.400 --> 1:59:21.400]  We love black people.
[1:59:21.400 --> 1:59:22.400]  Oh, we're Bill Gates.
[1:59:22.400 --> 1:59:26.360]  I don't know because they're covering for what they're really doing, killing everybody.
[1:59:26.360 --> 1:59:28.320]  But the main target is Africa.
[1:59:28.320 --> 1:59:30.120]  I got to say it's true.
[1:59:30.120 --> 1:59:32.000]  So again, it's like, oh, we love black so much.
[1:59:32.000 --> 1:59:33.000]  Oh, we love it.
[1:59:33.000 --> 1:59:34.440]  All the corporate advertising uses black people.
[1:59:34.440 --> 1:59:35.600]  I don't care if it's black people on ads.
[1:59:35.600 --> 1:59:36.600]  It doesn't bother me.
[1:59:36.600 --> 1:59:37.600]  I like it.
[1:59:37.600 --> 1:59:39.120]  It's fine except it's all the corporate ads.
[1:59:39.120 --> 1:59:44.360]  The corporations are claiming they own black people as their shield, as their front and
[1:59:44.360 --> 1:59:45.360]  it's sick.
[1:59:45.360 --> 1:59:48.200]  So if you don't do what Bill Gates wants, you're racist against black people.
[1:59:48.200 --> 1:59:51.040]  Yeah, right.
[1:59:51.040 --> 1:59:56.040]  It's so hard for me when I'm cutting ads to not get overly excited.
[1:59:56.040 --> 1:59:59.040]  People ask me all the time, they go, Joe, do you want cocaine or do you want meth?
[1:59:59.040 --> 2:00:00.040]  How are you so excited?
[2:00:00.040 --> 2:00:07.040]  How do I not get excited about world government, forced mass, forced inoculations, open announcements
[2:00:07.040 --> 2:00:09.160]  that our country is going to be dissolved?
[2:00:09.160 --> 2:00:10.160]  I'm sorry.
[2:00:10.160 --> 2:00:11.160]  I'm a fighter.
[2:00:11.160 --> 2:00:14.320]  And I know many of you out there watching and listening are fighters as well.
[2:00:14.320 --> 2:00:16.360]  And so I'll just say this.
[2:00:16.360 --> 2:00:17.360]  I try to be calm.
[2:00:17.360 --> 2:00:18.360]  I try to be focused.
[2:00:18.360 --> 2:00:22.240]  I don't know what I do, but I wasn't still on air right now.
[2:00:22.240 --> 2:00:28.000]  But I just really want to thank you for keeping us on air because you have to realize, when
[2:00:28.000 --> 2:00:31.600]  I tell you that you're the Info War, that's not me patting on the head.
[2:00:31.600 --> 2:00:35.320]  You are 99% of the equation.
[2:00:35.320 --> 2:00:39.480]  So when you decide to spread the word, when you decide to buy the products, infowarstore.com,
[2:00:39.480 --> 2:00:43.040]  when you decide to share the articles and videos we produce, it changes the world.
[2:00:43.040 --> 2:00:45.360]  So you are the Info War.
[2:00:45.360 --> 2:00:46.960]  Thank you so much for the fight.
[2:00:46.960 --> 2:00:48.560]  Thank you for all you've done.
[2:00:48.560 --> 2:00:54.440]  Now let's take action together and take down the globalist.
[2:00:54.440 --> 2:01:03.440]  The Alex Jones Show, because there is a war on for your mind.
[2:01:03.440 --> 2:01:20.480]  Ladies and gentlemen, we have some giant news breaking.
[2:01:20.480 --> 2:01:24.920]  Every few hours, more prestigious scientists, more prestigious doctors, virologists, go
[2:01:24.920 --> 2:01:27.360]  public and say this is not a vaccine.
[2:01:27.360 --> 2:01:38.200]  This is hell and mass death, mass convulsions, disease, epilepsy, narcolepsy, guion beret,
[2:01:38.200 --> 2:01:42.480]  Bell's palsy is just liquefying people's organs.
[2:01:42.480 --> 2:01:44.040]  It's insane.
[2:01:44.040 --> 2:01:48.120]  Mike Adams at naturalnews.com has drilled into what one of these top scientists and
[2:01:48.120 --> 2:01:54.040]  top vaccine scientists has said in the headline at naturalnews.com, it's also posted on infowars.com.
[2:01:54.040 --> 2:01:59.960]  Top vaccine scientists warns the world, halt all COVID-19 vaccines immediately or uncontrollable
[2:01:59.960 --> 2:02:03.160]  monsters will be unleashed.
[2:02:03.160 --> 2:02:05.880]  Gert Vanden Bocher.
[2:02:05.880 --> 2:02:07.640]  Mike Adams, get into this.
[2:02:07.640 --> 2:02:08.640]  This is huge.
[2:02:08.640 --> 2:02:09.640]  Take your time.
[2:02:09.640 --> 2:02:14.040]  Explain what's really going on and how this science works and now it's becoming very
[2:02:14.040 --> 2:02:15.760]  clear what their master plan is.
[2:02:15.760 --> 2:02:16.760]  All right.
[2:02:16.760 --> 2:02:17.760]  Thank you, Alex.
[2:02:17.760 --> 2:02:21.360]  This is by far the most important segment that I think I've ever done in joining your
[2:02:21.360 --> 2:02:22.440]  show.
[2:02:22.440 --> 2:02:27.200]  We're talking about the entire human race being at risk.
[2:02:27.200 --> 2:02:34.440]  This warning comes from Dr. Bosch, who is, by the way, a pro vaccine, pro Bill and Melinda
[2:02:34.440 --> 2:02:35.440]  Gates scientist.
[2:02:35.440 --> 2:02:37.840]  He's an independent vaccine consultant.
[2:02:37.840 --> 2:02:38.920]  He's worked with Gavi.
[2:02:38.920 --> 2:02:41.000]  He's worked with numerous vaccine companies.
[2:02:41.000 --> 2:02:44.520]  He's an expert in adjuvants and Ebola vaccines.
[2:02:44.520 --> 2:02:52.120]  He says, listen carefully, he says that this vaccine, the COVID vaccine, works individually.
[2:02:52.120 --> 2:02:53.200]  This is basic premise.
[2:02:53.200 --> 2:03:01.680]  It works individually, but because it works, it nullifies the weak SARS-CoV-2, the COVID-19
[2:03:01.680 --> 2:03:03.680]  strain that's been circulating.
[2:03:03.680 --> 2:03:05.320]  It nullifies that.
[2:03:05.320 --> 2:03:11.520]  But then in the aggregate across the population at large, it causes human bodies to build
[2:03:11.520 --> 2:03:17.440]  super strains, which are mutants and variants that are immune to the vaccine and could pose
[2:03:17.440 --> 2:03:24.680]  significantly higher risks of fatality and even a mass death across the globe.
[2:03:24.680 --> 2:03:30.480]  And at the same time, the vaccine that's being injected into people is, in essence, disabling
[2:03:30.480 --> 2:03:37.120]  their innate immunity, that is a broad spectrum immune system that can naturally fight the
[2:03:37.120 --> 2:03:41.520]  variants and mutant strains that may pose the greatest risk moving forward.
[2:03:41.520 --> 2:03:47.840]  So in essence, what I'm saying, Alex, is that the vaccine industry has figured out a way
[2:03:47.840 --> 2:03:54.600]  to cause human beings to be turned into mutant biological weapon factories.
[2:03:54.600 --> 2:03:59.720]  They will be building these weapons and then shedding those viruses across the population
[2:03:59.720 --> 2:04:05.800]  that has no defense against those strains because their immune systems have been weakened,
[2:04:05.800 --> 2:04:11.560]  essentially nullified by the vaccine itself while the vaccine is accelerating this adaptive
[2:04:11.560 --> 2:04:14.040]  response of these viruses.
[2:04:14.040 --> 2:04:19.080]  Now, importantly, I just want to be clear, this is me paraphrasing my understanding of
[2:04:19.080 --> 2:04:20.920]  Dr. Bosch's research.
[2:04:20.920 --> 2:04:23.040]  He is not an anti-vaxxer.
[2:04:23.040 --> 2:04:29.160]  He would not say that it's wrong for an individual in a certain circumstance to get a vaccine.
[2:04:29.160 --> 2:04:34.560]  He is saying that it's the wrong weapon to use prophylactically across the population
[2:04:34.560 --> 2:04:35.560]  at large.
[2:04:35.560 --> 2:04:36.560]  Let me stop you, though.
[2:04:36.560 --> 2:04:37.560]  Yes.
[2:04:37.560 --> 2:04:38.560]  Absolutely.
[2:04:38.560 --> 2:04:39.560]  It's not that vaccine science isn't real.
[2:04:39.560 --> 2:04:41.800]  It's that it's had side effects, it's had problems.
[2:04:41.800 --> 2:04:44.600]  This is now gene therapy told me different, but let me back you up.
[2:04:44.600 --> 2:04:46.680]  I'm on the same line of research.
[2:04:46.680 --> 2:04:49.360]  This is what Wolfgang Wodarg of the EU Warning Commission said.
[2:04:49.360 --> 2:04:52.440]  It's what the former chief scientist at Pfizer said back in December.
[2:04:52.440 --> 2:04:54.520]  They said the same things that this scientist is saying.
[2:04:54.520 --> 2:05:01.880]  But here's the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center said three years ago, 2018, scientists
[2:05:01.880 --> 2:05:07.760]  find cancer drivers hiding in RNA, not DNA, and they say that DNA almost never causes
[2:05:07.760 --> 2:05:14.560]  cancer, that it's viruses and that's any RNA or mRNA that is causing it, but then plugs
[2:05:14.560 --> 2:05:15.560]  in and does it.
[2:05:15.560 --> 2:05:20.800]  And they go on to basically say that when you put mRNA into somebody, it can suppress
[2:05:20.800 --> 2:05:25.440]  the protein that blocks tumors, and that's why people then grow tumors when they take
[2:05:25.440 --> 2:05:26.440]  an mRNA vaccine.
[2:05:26.440 --> 2:05:28.400]  This is before COVID.
[2:05:28.400 --> 2:05:33.400]  And then if you expand on that, here is an article on NPR, COVID-19 vaccines could add
[2:05:33.400 --> 2:05:36.480]  fuel to evolution of coronavirus mutations.
[2:05:36.480 --> 2:05:38.480]  This is from February 10th this year.
[2:05:38.480 --> 2:05:41.240]  Other top scientists admitting that.
[2:05:41.240 --> 2:05:46.600]  And so this is incredibly out of the open, a preplanned operation by Bill Gates and
[2:05:46.600 --> 2:05:47.600]  the globalists.
[2:05:47.600 --> 2:05:48.600]  What do you think?
[2:05:48.600 --> 2:05:49.600]  I believe it is deliberate.
[2:05:49.600 --> 2:05:50.600]  Absolutely.
[2:05:50.600 --> 2:05:54.720]  I believe that they knew, and I'm talking about Fauci and the NIH and the globalists
[2:05:54.720 --> 2:05:56.840]  who are pushing depopulation.
[2:05:56.840 --> 2:06:02.640]  They knew that if they engineered a weak virus and then whipped it up through media frenzy
[2:06:02.640 --> 2:06:08.440]  and fear, they could cause the economic lockdowns, they could try to harm Trump, but most importantly,
[2:06:08.440 --> 2:06:12.160]  they could get people to line up and beg for vaccines, and then they could put the real
[2:06:12.160 --> 2:06:15.520]  weapon mechanism in the vaccines themselves.
[2:06:15.520 --> 2:06:19.000]  So as you just mentioned, there are multiple mechanisms in the vaccines that could lead
[2:06:19.000 --> 2:06:20.320]  to mass death.
[2:06:20.320 --> 2:06:25.000]  I'm not talking about just a few thousand people or even a few million people, potentially
[2:06:25.000 --> 2:06:28.720]  this could be killing hundreds of millions of people over the next few years around
[2:06:28.720 --> 2:06:29.960]  the world.
[2:06:29.960 --> 2:06:35.000]  But the multiple mechanisms, one of them is called antibody dependent enhancement, ADE.
[2:06:35.000 --> 2:06:39.280]  Dr. Sherry Tenpenny has discussed that in great detail.
[2:06:39.280 --> 2:06:42.360]  Dell Bigtree and others have talked about this.
[2:06:42.360 --> 2:06:48.840]  This is a mechanism that will cause a hyper-inflammatory reaction upon the person's next exposure
[2:06:48.840 --> 2:06:51.720]  to a coronavirus strain in the wild.
[2:06:51.720 --> 2:06:56.760]  And yet, the vaccine is causing people to build those strains, to have mutations in
[2:06:56.760 --> 2:06:59.600]  their own bodies, and then to release those strains.
[2:06:59.600 --> 2:07:04.760]  So it's like the vaccine industry figured out a way to turn the people against themselves
[2:07:04.760 --> 2:07:06.240]  or against each other.
[2:07:06.240 --> 2:07:08.280]  They're turning people into biological weapons.
[2:07:08.280 --> 2:07:12.320]  And this is what Dr. Bosch is warning about, that they're releasing a, quote, uncontrollable
[2:07:12.320 --> 2:07:17.940]  monster with consequences that almost are unimaginable.
[2:07:17.940 --> 2:07:21.800]  That may be the greatest mistake ever made in the history of human civilization, and
[2:07:21.800 --> 2:07:27.320]  it could lead to the fall of nations, the fall of cities in the United States, of states,
[2:07:27.320 --> 2:07:30.000]  of entire sectors of the economy.
[2:07:30.000 --> 2:07:35.040]  It could change the geopolitical landscape also, given that 80 percent of Biden supporters
[2:07:35.040 --> 2:07:40.080]  want to get vaccinated, while only 30 percent of Trump supporters want to get vaccinated.
[2:07:40.080 --> 2:07:47.080]  If the worst-case scenario unfolds here, we could be looking at mass death of pro-vaccine
[2:07:47.080 --> 2:07:51.640]  Democrats, frankly, which would have enormous implications for the financial collapse of
[2:07:51.640 --> 2:07:56.960]  cities, pension funds, how cities are able to fund emergency services and infrastructure,
[2:07:56.960 --> 2:08:01.640]  such as roads, bridges, firefighters, fire response teams, and so on.
[2:08:01.640 --> 2:08:06.800]  Alex, you almost can't talk too big about the economic and public health implications
[2:08:06.800 --> 2:08:10.320]  of this, and it's all been said into motion, I believe, deliberately.
[2:08:10.320 --> 2:08:13.440]  Mike, I'm here looking at the literature.
[2:08:13.440 --> 2:08:18.480]  They are admitting that this is going to cause deadly mutations of the common flu.
[2:08:18.480 --> 2:08:23.680]  This is a design carrier to do this, and now they're thinking that that's what actually
[2:08:23.680 --> 2:08:25.200]  what the original virus does.
[2:08:25.200 --> 2:08:29.760]  It's not that deadly to most people, but that it starts mutating in your cells as well and
[2:08:29.760 --> 2:08:31.680]  causing you to create mutations.
[2:08:31.680 --> 2:08:35.320]  But then the vaccine is an even higher level of this, and that's why Bill Gates has told
[2:08:35.320 --> 2:08:39.640]  all these programs that, oh, don't worry, this was really a test, a bigger attack's coming
[2:08:39.640 --> 2:08:40.640]  from terrorists.
[2:08:40.640 --> 2:08:44.680]  Well, he's the terrorist, and now it's out in the open, but they think they'll get away
[2:08:44.680 --> 2:08:48.600]  with it because they've already told us, oh, climate change, deadlier viruses are coming
[2:08:48.600 --> 2:08:53.480]  and they have Hollywood movies about COVID-22, COVID-23 killing millions.
[2:08:53.480 --> 2:08:54.480]  So they're even pre-programming.
[2:08:54.480 --> 2:08:57.400]  Mike, you can see the whole thing unfolding.
[2:08:57.400 --> 2:09:02.800]  This is an extermination agenda, and scientifically, the best way to stop this virus is to vaccinate
[2:09:02.800 --> 2:09:08.520]  almost no one and just let the virus adapt to the host and become less and less dangerous.
[2:09:08.520 --> 2:09:12.960]  That's what the former head of the Rockefeller Hospital said a year ago, remember?
[2:09:12.960 --> 2:09:13.960]  That's right.
[2:09:13.960 --> 2:09:14.960]  That's right.
[2:09:14.960 --> 2:09:18.920]  I mean, at this point, it's really no worse than the flu in most people, but by pushing
[2:09:18.920 --> 2:09:24.480]  the vaccine on everybody, including the asymptomatic carriers, by the way, the younger people,
[2:09:24.480 --> 2:09:28.320]  and by the way, I should just say the younger people, they're the ones who are going to
[2:09:28.320 --> 2:09:32.120]  die now in large numbers in the second wave of this, if this scenario unfolds.
[2:09:32.120 --> 2:09:33.120]  Explain.
[2:09:33.120 --> 2:09:36.000]  Just like Spanish flu, they really had an autoimmune response to the virus.
[2:09:36.000 --> 2:09:38.000]  Now they're going to have violent autoimmune responses.
[2:09:38.000 --> 2:09:40.320]  The younger the people, what do we do for our children then?
[2:09:40.320 --> 2:09:43.720]  I'm so worried about my children now, and that's exactly what I was reading, Mike.
[2:09:43.720 --> 2:09:48.080]  See, children have really strong, really flexible innate immune systems that can handle different
[2:09:48.080 --> 2:09:53.240]  strains and different mutations automatically, but when you vaccinate them, those who don't
[2:09:53.240 --> 2:09:58.240]  even need vaccinations, even if the vaccines work, you vaccinate them, you disable their
[2:09:58.240 --> 2:10:03.440]  general response, innate immunity, you make them defenseless against the mutant strains
[2:10:03.440 --> 2:10:07.960]  that are being built in other people's bodies and then released through viral shedding.
[2:10:07.960 --> 2:10:11.400]  So the youth are going to be in real trouble in the next year.
[2:10:11.400 --> 2:10:14.560]  And so our immune systems are so powerful, the globalists couldn't cook stuff up that
[2:10:14.560 --> 2:10:18.360]  would kill us in mass unless they got our own bodies and produced what kills us.
[2:10:18.360 --> 2:10:19.360]  That's right.
[2:10:19.360 --> 2:10:21.600]  They turned us into their bioweapons factories, exactly.
[2:10:21.600 --> 2:10:25.960]  And that's not just the scientists you reported on as a top guy, but even MPR admits that.
[2:10:25.960 --> 2:10:30.520]  Meanwhile, they've got national governments saying, if you don't take the vaccine, you're
[2:10:30.520 --> 2:10:31.960]  the reason we can't go out.
[2:10:31.960 --> 2:10:32.960]  You're the reason there'll be spreaders.
[2:10:32.960 --> 2:10:36.120]  Then they say, but even if you take the vaccine, you still can't go outside.
[2:10:36.120 --> 2:10:38.280]  This is the total dystopic takeover.
[2:10:38.280 --> 2:10:40.320]  Mike Adams is on fire, as usual, naturalnews.com.
[2:10:40.320 --> 2:10:44.120]  We'll be back in a few minutes to talk to you about where we go from here.
[2:10:44.120 --> 2:10:49.800]  Stay with us, infowars.com, tomorrow's news today.
[2:10:49.800 --> 2:10:52.160]  You know, it's crazy to get to this point.
[2:10:52.160 --> 2:10:54.080]  It's very bittersweet.
[2:10:54.080 --> 2:10:56.920]  Everything we've talked about has happened just like we said it would.
[2:10:56.920 --> 2:10:59.000]  And now we have a lot of credibility, but I don't care about that.
[2:10:59.000 --> 2:11:00.600]  I care about beating the new world order.
[2:11:00.600 --> 2:11:05.840]  And it's because we have so much credibility, they can't allow us to stay on air much longer.
[2:11:05.840 --> 2:11:09.080]  Yeah, I don't have time to tell you all the stuff they're doing to us for a lot of reasons.
[2:11:09.080 --> 2:11:12.720]  I can't tell you what's going on, but let's just say this, we're going to see this through
[2:11:12.720 --> 2:11:13.720]  the end.
[2:11:13.720 --> 2:11:16.320]  We're going to stay on air as long as we can.
[2:11:16.320 --> 2:11:18.880]  So please pray for us and please buy the products.
[2:11:18.880 --> 2:11:22.520]  Then infowars.com, they're great products, plus they fund the operation.
[2:11:22.520 --> 2:11:25.680]  So you know, unlike other products you can buy, they're still great.
[2:11:25.680 --> 2:11:26.680]  Do they fund freedom?
[2:11:26.680 --> 2:11:27.680]  No, a lot of them don't.
[2:11:27.680 --> 2:11:32.360]  These are great products that fund freedom and fund justice when the whole world's waking
[2:11:32.360 --> 2:11:34.200]  up and looking for truth.
[2:11:34.200 --> 2:11:35.840]  That's why the globalists are censoring.
[2:11:35.840 --> 2:11:39.240]  They can't bring in all this tyranny and leave people like us on the air.
[2:11:39.240 --> 2:11:42.720]  So while you're at it, don't just financially support us and spread the word.
[2:11:42.720 --> 2:11:46.160]  Download everything we've done you can find and save it because who knows how long we're
[2:11:46.160 --> 2:11:50.000]  going to be on the air and the enemy is trying to destroy everything we ever said.
[2:11:50.000 --> 2:11:54.440]  As you know, we're always upping our game at infowars and we brought you a new supplement,
[2:11:54.440 --> 2:11:58.040]  a new product that we know you're going to love, especially if you have trouble sleeping.
[2:11:58.040 --> 2:11:59.120]  It is down and out.
[2:11:59.120 --> 2:12:00.920]  We don't mean bankrupt under a bridge.
[2:12:00.920 --> 2:12:03.960]  We mean down your bed, sleeping hard throughout the night.
[2:12:03.960 --> 2:12:07.040]  It's got four milligrams of high quality melatonin.
[2:12:07.040 --> 2:12:09.600]  It's got 25 milligrams of passion flower.
[2:12:09.600 --> 2:12:13.240]  It's got 50 milligrams of valerian root extract concentrate.
[2:12:13.240 --> 2:12:18.240]  It's got 100 milligrams of lemon balm and 150 milligrams of German chamomile.
[2:12:18.240 --> 2:12:20.760]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is a very strong formula.
[2:12:20.760 --> 2:12:23.920]  I recommend you only take a quarter or a half the first time.

[2:12:31.040 --> 2:12:35.800]  It's basically a liquid formula of rocket rest and so popular we can't keep it in stock.

[2:13:06.000 --> 2:13:11.840]  I want to be clear what Mike Adams is reporting on at naturalnews.com with top vaccine scientists,
[2:13:11.840 --> 2:13:15.720]  worldwide respected Gert van den Bosch, he's not isolated.
[2:13:15.720 --> 2:13:20.520]  I just showed you an NPR article, a New York Times article admitting it could create super
[2:13:20.520 --> 2:13:21.520]  strength.
[2:13:21.520 --> 2:13:23.640]  They're saying it will.
[2:13:23.640 --> 2:13:24.640]  Bill Gates knows what he's doing.
[2:13:24.640 --> 2:13:29.360]  Here's a clip from him a year ago on Colbert saying, oh, I'm a hero.
[2:13:29.360 --> 2:13:32.640]  I predicted all this with the Rockefeller Foundation that actually called for using
[2:13:32.640 --> 2:13:35.280]  viruses to sterilize us and kill us starting in the 60s.
[2:13:35.280 --> 2:13:37.480]  We showed those articles first hour.
[2:13:37.480 --> 2:13:40.040]  And then he's like, oh, terrorists are going to release something far worse.
[2:13:40.040 --> 2:13:43.320]  Now they're telling us, oh, climate change, it's coming, something worse.
[2:13:43.320 --> 2:13:47.720]  And they use it to lock down, consolidate power, China takes over, big tech takes over.
[2:13:47.720 --> 2:13:49.200]  Here's a clip of what he said last year.
[2:13:49.200 --> 2:13:52.440]  And now we know what they're going to say it's terrorist watch.
[2:13:52.440 --> 2:13:56.600]  When people are falling dead all around us, Dr. Tenpenny thinks it will be in just a few
[2:13:56.600 --> 2:13:57.600]  months.
[2:13:57.600 --> 2:14:00.840]  We're already seeing old folks dying everywhere, but that's the immediate response.
[2:14:00.840 --> 2:14:06.040]  That's not, I think that's just a collateral damage of how deadly this is.
[2:14:06.040 --> 2:14:07.680]  All the evidence shows it's coming.
[2:14:07.680 --> 2:14:08.680]  It's a soft kill.
[2:14:08.680 --> 2:14:09.960]  So they have plausible deniability.
[2:14:09.960 --> 2:14:10.960]  There's no gauge.
[2:14:10.960 --> 2:14:15.360]  What's the next thing you're warning us about that's going to happen five years from now
[2:14:15.360 --> 2:14:18.360]  that we're not listening to at the present?
[2:14:18.360 --> 2:14:21.520]  Well, I, I didn't want to be right.
[2:14:21.520 --> 2:14:23.760]  What I wanted to do is, I understand.
[2:14:23.760 --> 2:14:26.000]  I'm not saying you won.
[2:14:26.000 --> 2:14:27.000]  Everybody loses.
[2:14:27.000 --> 2:14:28.000]  Nobody wins with us.
[2:14:28.000 --> 2:14:30.600]  And I'm not saying that you're, that you're, this is an end zone, Dan.
[2:14:30.600 --> 2:14:36.520]  I'm just saying, what else are we not listening to that we need to take action on now?
[2:14:36.520 --> 2:14:43.720]  Well, the, the idea of a, a bioterrorist attack is kind of the nightmare scenario because
[2:14:43.720 --> 2:14:46.840]  they're a pathogen with a high death rate would be ticked.
[2:14:46.840 --> 2:14:53.160]  Now the good news is, not kind of depressions, tough enough now, that most of the work we're
[2:14:53.160 --> 2:14:59.200]  going to do to be ready for pandemic two, I call this pandemic one.
[2:14:59.200 --> 2:15:03.840]  Most of the work we'll do to be ready for that are also the things we need to do to
[2:15:03.840 --> 2:15:06.960]  minimize the threat of, of bioterrorism.
[2:15:06.960 --> 2:15:11.360]  Well, Mr. Gates, thanks so much for being here.
[2:15:11.360 --> 2:15:12.360]  Thanks so much for the effort.
[2:15:12.360 --> 2:15:13.360]  Look how sick you are.
[2:15:13.360 --> 2:15:14.360]  Look how happy you are.
[2:15:14.360 --> 2:15:15.960]  Okay, Mike, we got seven minutes left.
[2:15:15.960 --> 2:15:16.960]  I appreciate you.
[2:15:16.960 --> 2:15:17.960]  I've been cutting in a lot.
[2:15:17.960 --> 2:15:18.960]  Just agreeing with you.
[2:15:18.960 --> 2:15:19.960]  This is so important.
[2:15:19.960 --> 2:15:22.360]  You've got the floor to finish up what you think's coming and how we stop this because
[2:15:22.360 --> 2:15:23.360]  this is so obvious.
[2:15:23.360 --> 2:15:25.840]  I don't know how they think they're going to get away with it.
[2:15:25.840 --> 2:15:29.160]  Well individually, one, one of the important things we need to realize is that people who
[2:15:29.160 --> 2:15:31.480]  are vaccinated are ticking time bombs.
[2:15:31.480 --> 2:15:33.920]  They're walking bio weapons.
[2:15:33.920 --> 2:15:37.000]  And if you look at really what's going to happen here, it's going to be the vaccinated
[2:15:37.000 --> 2:15:42.840]  killing the vaccinated because you're going to, you're going to have a vaccinated people
[2:15:42.840 --> 2:15:45.680]  who are shedding the viruses and then you're going to have other vaccinated people who
[2:15:45.680 --> 2:15:49.840]  have weakened innate immune systems who are more susceptible to those strains.
[2:15:49.840 --> 2:15:53.200]  So it's kind of like a zombie movie where the zombies are eating the zombies.
[2:15:53.200 --> 2:15:56.680]  You're going to have the vaccinated killing the vaccinated now, but then the media will
[2:15:56.680 --> 2:15:59.640]  blame the unvaccinated during all of this.
[2:15:59.640 --> 2:16:04.880]  So the unvaccinated are going to be condemned as mass murderers and terrorists.
[2:16:04.880 --> 2:16:09.880]  When it's actually the vaccinated, the vaccinated who are the murderers inadvertently, I'm not
[2:16:09.880 --> 2:16:12.000]  saying that they want to go out and kill people.
[2:16:12.000 --> 2:16:16.960]  They're just gullible and brainwashed and they believe in false authority like the CDC
[2:16:16.960 --> 2:16:18.440]  and the WHO.
[2:16:18.440 --> 2:16:22.160]  So fast forward two to three years.
[2:16:22.160 --> 2:16:27.640]  If these predictions are true that Dr. Bosch is warning about and that Dr. Tenpenny is warning
[2:16:27.640 --> 2:16:32.280]  about, then the whole global landscape is going to be entirely different, Alex.
[2:16:32.280 --> 2:16:37.880]  We're talking about a massive population reduction, which is what Bill Gates once openly, we're
[2:16:37.880 --> 2:16:44.520]  talking about a collapse of real estate values, a collapse of tax revenues for municipalities,
[2:16:44.520 --> 2:16:48.880]  city, states and nations all around the world, therefore the collapse of governments and
[2:16:48.880 --> 2:16:51.640]  pension funds and probably stock markets and so on.
[2:16:51.640 --> 2:16:57.320]  So the economic implications of the public health crisis that's being unleashed by mass
[2:16:57.320 --> 2:17:02.160]  vaccinations, it's almost too much to consider.
[2:17:02.160 --> 2:17:06.000]  It's going to be totally insane and yeah, those globalists, they think it's funny because
[2:17:06.000 --> 2:17:07.240]  this is their goal.
[2:17:07.240 --> 2:17:08.480]  That's what they want to do.
[2:17:08.480 --> 2:17:10.600]  So what can we do?
[2:17:10.600 --> 2:17:13.880]  Of course, all the things that you've been talking about and your guest, Alex, which
[2:17:13.880 --> 2:17:19.600]  is boost your immune function, make sure you have good nutrition, get plenty of rest and
[2:17:19.600 --> 2:17:24.840]  avoid vaccinated people because they are the virus shedders.
[2:17:24.840 --> 2:17:29.680]  They are the mutant factories and then get educated and try to educate the people around
[2:17:29.680 --> 2:17:34.960]  you so that they learn before they run over and try to get vaccinated because if you vaccinate
[2:17:34.960 --> 2:17:39.760]  yourself as an ignorant, uninformed person, you are sacrificing your life.
[2:17:39.760 --> 2:17:46.680]  I call it vaccine suicide and I'm sad to say, I'll say this publicly, there are distant
[2:17:46.680 --> 2:17:51.560]  relatives in my own family who are committing vaccine suicide, probably in your family too.
[2:17:51.560 --> 2:17:55.720]  You're watching this and friends, people you know, maybe co-workers who are committing
[2:17:55.720 --> 2:17:57.480]  vaccine suicide.
[2:17:57.480 --> 2:18:01.800]  It doesn't kill them necessarily immediately, although it is killing some people right away,
[2:18:01.800 --> 2:18:07.360]  but the long-term effects, not even long-term, medium-term, it could be a year, it could
[2:18:07.360 --> 2:18:10.920]  be less than two years, it could be a few months, depends on how quickly the mutant
[2:18:10.920 --> 2:18:16.400]  strains are created, many of those vaccinated people will die, almost certainly.
[2:18:16.400 --> 2:18:22.600]  So this is what we're looking at in terms of this really apocalyptic medical situation
[2:18:22.600 --> 2:18:27.800]  that's being put in place by the vaccine companies intentionally while they're making money,
[2:18:27.800 --> 2:18:32.760]  they're having massive profits, sacrificing human lives, just like what Governor Cuomo
[2:18:32.760 --> 2:18:36.000]  did in New York, but on a much larger scale.
[2:18:36.000 --> 2:18:40.080]  For his political gains, he sacrificed the elderly, stuffed them in the nursing homes.
[2:18:40.080 --> 2:18:41.520]  Well, he was ordered to do that.
[2:18:41.520 --> 2:18:44.680]  Other Democrats followed it all over the country and all over the world.
[2:18:44.680 --> 2:18:48.800]  New States globalist operatives did, but he's too dumb to even turn it against them.
[2:18:48.800 --> 2:18:51.160]  He's too dumb to even realize what they're doing to him.
[2:18:51.160 --> 2:18:57.360]  Well, absolutely, but it shows you how demonic these Democrat control freaks are.
[2:18:57.360 --> 2:18:58.860]  They hate humanity.
[2:18:58.860 --> 2:19:02.800]  They literally want to mass-murder the human race, and it looks like they're achieving
[2:19:02.800 --> 2:19:05.520]  it, but who's saying no to this?
[2:19:05.520 --> 2:19:10.600]  The informed Trump supporters, conservatives, viewers of your show, of my website and so
[2:19:10.600 --> 2:19:14.600]  on, it's the informed independent people who are going to be the survivors of this.
[2:19:14.600 --> 2:19:18.360]  And Mike, the most important thing you said is, A, the mainline literature in the top
[2:19:18.360 --> 2:19:22.520]  site that says this is going to create real super strains, and it's going to cause auto
[2:19:22.520 --> 2:19:26.760]  immune responses to cytokine storms, Spanish flu type stuff, autoimmune attacks on the
[2:19:26.760 --> 2:19:28.120]  body, liquefying the organs.
[2:19:28.120 --> 2:19:34.200]  It's already happening, but worse than that is, then once the next big wave breaks out
[2:19:34.200 --> 2:19:39.280]  from this, could be months, could be a year, according to medical doctors and scientists,
[2:19:39.280 --> 2:19:40.280]  they're going to blame us.
[2:19:40.280 --> 2:19:41.280]  There already are.
[2:19:41.280 --> 2:19:42.280]  He was on the literature.
[2:19:42.280 --> 2:19:43.280]  It admits it's not us.
[2:19:43.280 --> 2:19:45.080]  It doesn't matter, they're still getting ready to blame us.
[2:19:45.080 --> 2:19:46.080]  This is so dangerous.
[2:19:46.080 --> 2:19:48.120]  You can see the whole plan right now.
[2:19:48.120 --> 2:19:54.960]  They're going to push the mass panic in the second wave, and then say that this justifies
[2:19:54.960 --> 2:19:56.680]  gunpoint vaccinations.
[2:19:56.680 --> 2:20:01.440]  So at that point, they will be able to have the political power to unleash now the woke
[2:20:01.440 --> 2:20:07.400]  military to go door to door in cities across America, confiscating your guns and vaccinating
[2:20:07.400 --> 2:20:08.400]  you at gunpoint.
[2:20:08.400 --> 2:20:13.840]  That's right, medical tyranny with a race war, with gun confiscation, a medical tyranny
[2:20:13.840 --> 2:20:15.500]  civil war is the amended plan.
[2:20:15.500 --> 2:20:20.440]  You see it all being set up now in a minute and a half, how do we stop it?
[2:20:20.440 --> 2:20:21.440]  Number one, we have to survive.
[2:20:21.440 --> 2:20:23.120]  We have to be alive in order to fight this.
[2:20:23.120 --> 2:20:25.920]  So all the things we just mentioned, take care of your immune system, take care of your
[2:20:25.920 --> 2:20:30.720]  health, avoid the vaccine at all costs, and avoid other people who are vaccinated.
[2:20:30.720 --> 2:20:35.080]  Secondly, we've got to continue to build out our independent platforms like you have done,
[2:20:35.080 --> 2:20:36.080]  like I'm doing.
[2:20:36.080 --> 2:20:38.920]  We've got to continue to expand our reach.
[2:20:38.920 --> 2:20:43.560]  The mainstream media is collapsing in terms of its viewership, and yet more and more people
[2:20:43.560 --> 2:20:48.560]  are viewing independent truth media, even though the censorship has never been worse.
[2:20:48.560 --> 2:20:53.240]  But we are winning to those people who are willing to live.
[2:20:53.240 --> 2:20:56.920]  Those who want to commit suicide and die, we can't help them any longer.
[2:20:56.920 --> 2:21:01.600]  Pray for them, wish them the best, but wave goodbye to those people because many of those
[2:21:01.600 --> 2:21:04.200]  people, millions or even hundreds of millions may die.
[2:21:04.200 --> 2:21:07.440]  But for the survivors, educate, inform, and connect.
[2:21:07.440 --> 2:21:12.400]  And that's how we can rebuild society after this vaccine, holocaust is unleashed upon
[2:21:12.400 --> 2:21:13.400]  our world.
[2:21:13.400 --> 2:21:14.400]  And that's what it is, Alex.
[2:21:14.400 --> 2:21:20.680]  It's a vaccine holocaust that will kill maybe a thousand times more people than the holocaust
[2:21:20.680 --> 2:21:21.680]  of World War II.
[2:21:21.680 --> 2:21:22.680]  We don't know.
[2:21:22.680 --> 2:21:23.680]  And I agree.
[2:21:23.680 --> 2:21:26.560]  Everything it got level intellectually tells me this is just incredibly dangerous, and
[2:21:26.560 --> 2:21:28.840]  we've got to warn people now while we still can.
[2:21:28.840 --> 2:21:32.480]  Everybody's got to fight harder than ever to spread the word because I don't think Bill
[2:21:32.480 --> 2:21:33.560]  Gates is going to get away with it.
[2:21:33.560 --> 2:21:35.320]  All these countries are banning vaccines.
[2:21:35.320 --> 2:21:36.440]  All these scientists are coming out.
[2:21:36.440 --> 2:21:37.440]  You're coming out.
[2:21:37.440 --> 2:21:38.920]  I don't think it's just going well in 10 seconds.
[2:21:38.920 --> 2:21:41.120]  Do you think it's backfiring on them at a certain level?
[2:21:41.120 --> 2:21:42.360]  Not yet, but it will.
[2:21:42.360 --> 2:21:46.560]  It's beginning to 24 countries in Europe have suspended the AstraZeneca vaccine, and Italy
[2:21:46.560 --> 2:21:48.400]  has launched a possible criminal investigation.
[2:21:48.400 --> 2:21:49.400]  That's right.
[2:21:49.400 --> 2:21:50.400]  Thank you, Mike.
[2:21:50.400 --> 2:21:54.560]  I'm not going to sit here and waste your time or my time and rattle off the successes
[2:21:54.560 --> 2:21:59.040]  and the worst is that if you're paying attention, you know, we've done together.
[2:21:59.040 --> 2:22:06.480]  But I'll tell you this, the technocrats are really upping their game, and they are trying
[2:22:06.480 --> 2:22:09.040]  to destroy all independent forms of media.
[2:22:09.040 --> 2:22:14.920]  They're trying to shudder and silence the human resistance, so now is the time to understand
[2:22:14.920 --> 2:22:18.360]  that everything we've talked about has been proven accurate, and everything you warned
[2:22:18.360 --> 2:22:20.920]  your friends and family about is about to be true.
[2:22:20.920 --> 2:22:25.960]  So it's now that your credibility is way up, the power structures are to silence those
[2:22:25.960 --> 2:22:27.440]  of us that they can.
[2:22:27.440 --> 2:22:32.680]  But it's up to all of us to not let them silence any of us.
[2:22:32.680 --> 2:22:38.720]  We have the power, but the sun is setting on humanity and setting on free speech.
[2:22:38.720 --> 2:22:43.800]  We have to make sure that we fight hard right now to make sure that a long, dark night doesn't
[2:22:43.800 --> 2:22:44.800]  come.
[2:22:44.800 --> 2:22:50.040]  So be the polar bearer as you are.
[2:22:50.040 --> 2:22:53.480]  I don't like coming to you and saying this could be our last broadcast.
[2:22:53.480 --> 2:22:57.680]  Hell, I've been on there 27 years, and only the last year or so have I said that.
[2:22:57.680 --> 2:23:00.880]  But let me tell you, the New World Order is breathing down our neck.
[2:23:00.880 --> 2:23:03.960]  The big, globalist publications are coming after us, and they're doing everything they
[2:23:03.960 --> 2:23:05.280]  can to shut us down.
[2:23:05.280 --> 2:23:09.600]  So please pray to keep Info Wars on the air, and please support the local states you're

[2:24:53.680 --> 2:24:59.560]  Snowden and others taught us how mobile phones are constantly spying on us, not just tracking
[2:24:59.560 --> 2:25:07.000]  and recording our GPS location, but recording audio and video as well, with or without a
[2:25:07.000 --> 2:25:08.000]  battery.

[2:25:53.600 --> 2:26:06.600]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:26:06.600 --> 2:26:20.720]  Well, he's called person number one by the FBI.
[2:26:20.720 --> 2:26:24.600]  Articles of the New York Times are watching the post by the day.
[2:26:24.600 --> 2:26:27.640]  CNN called for his arrest.
[2:26:27.640 --> 2:26:30.160]  They called for my arrest for interviewing him.
[2:26:30.160 --> 2:26:33.240]  You can't let him actually speak for himself.
[2:26:33.240 --> 2:26:37.800]  I've known Stewart since really before he founded Oathkeepers back when he was really
[2:26:37.800 --> 2:26:44.160]  a spokesperson for Ron Paul, and he's a Yale law graduate, and of course, you know, been
[2:26:44.160 --> 2:26:49.520]  someone that's written about the impending globalist police state, and he's got an organization
[2:26:49.520 --> 2:26:53.200]  called Oathkeepers that follows the Constitution and gets law enforcement police, former and
[2:26:53.200 --> 2:26:56.600]  current to just say that they'll follow the Bill of Rights and Constitution.
[2:26:56.600 --> 2:27:02.000]  Well, because a couple members of his group out of tens of thousands went into the Capitol,
[2:27:02.000 --> 2:27:04.320]  they're trying to send him to prison.
[2:27:04.320 --> 2:27:08.640]  They're holding others without bail that didn't even break anything or do anything, saying
[2:27:08.640 --> 2:27:12.800]  they planned to kidnap and kill everybody with no evidence, and they're arresting them
[2:27:12.800 --> 2:27:16.960]  saying that they killed the cop, even though the cop, they now admit the family says died
[2:27:16.960 --> 2:27:18.800]  of a heart attack and a stroke later.
[2:27:18.800 --> 2:27:23.960]  So here he is, the guy that the media won't actually quote, they just lie about him, and
[2:27:23.960 --> 2:27:28.840]  if they can frame him, they can then, like Domino's, frame us all, person number one,
[2:27:28.840 --> 2:27:33.440]  demonized by the globalist, by the corporate media, here able to actually say what's really
[2:27:33.440 --> 2:27:34.960]  going on.
[2:27:34.960 --> 2:27:38.000]  So they admit the Washington Post that they want to indict you, they're trying to build
[2:27:38.000 --> 2:27:42.480]  a case on person number one, Stewart, even though they admit the article that you're
[2:27:42.480 --> 2:27:46.160]  on the text by just saying, get out of the Capitol, come out, get out of the Capitol,
[2:27:46.160 --> 2:27:48.080]  you never said do that.
[2:27:48.080 --> 2:27:49.720]  So tell us what's really going on here.
[2:27:49.720 --> 2:27:55.400]  Well, all they have is, is I told my guys, if you're not on security detail, come to
[2:27:55.400 --> 2:27:58.040]  the Northeast corner of the Capitol.
[2:27:58.040 --> 2:28:03.760]  We were protecting the Latinos for Trump event about two blocks to the Northeast of the Capitol,
[2:28:03.760 --> 2:28:10.000]  and our men were out on PSD details, escorting the staff, steel speakers, doing the PSD for
[2:28:10.000 --> 2:28:12.920]  Roger Stone, and then also securing events.
[2:28:12.920 --> 2:28:17.520]  And there was, you know, there was a supposedly supposed to be an event right there on the
[2:28:17.520 --> 2:28:22.560]  Capitol lawn by Ali Alexander, right, reserve, reserve space.
[2:28:22.560 --> 2:28:26.680]  And so our guys were escorting some of his speakers from the ellipse back up towards
[2:28:26.680 --> 2:28:28.840]  the Capitol to go do an event.
[2:28:28.840 --> 2:28:33.120]  And so when, when we saw that there, people were breaching around the Capitol, we heard
[2:28:33.120 --> 2:28:37.320]  they're breaking into the Capitol, I told my guys, we're not on PSD detail, come to
[2:28:37.320 --> 2:28:40.960]  me at the Northeast corner outside the Capitol, that's where I was standing.
[2:28:40.960 --> 2:28:41.960]  And that's all they got.
[2:28:41.960 --> 2:28:46.600]  That's the only, the only, only communication from me to my men has come, come to me if you're
[2:28:46.600 --> 2:28:48.120]  not on PSD detail.
[2:28:48.120 --> 2:28:49.120]  And that's it.
[2:28:49.120 --> 2:28:51.920]  They're trying to bootstrap into some kind of fix some conspiracy.
[2:28:51.920 --> 2:28:55.760]  Bottom line is though, is that they are suing President Trump, we've got Benny Thompson,
[2:28:55.760 --> 2:29:00.240]  the congressman from Georgia, who is suing President Trump, and Rudy Giuliani, and Oath
[2:29:00.240 --> 2:29:05.040]  Keepers and Proud Boys, alleging that all of us were in some kind of grand conspiracy
[2:29:05.040 --> 2:29:09.800]  to assault the Capitol and disrupt the proceedings of Congress, which is completely wrong.
[2:29:09.800 --> 2:29:13.600]  And the last thing you would do would be want to do this at the Capitol.
[2:29:13.600 --> 2:29:16.760]  We wanted a 10 day investigation because one hadn't been done by the Senate.
[2:29:16.760 --> 2:29:17.760]  We were there supporting that.
[2:29:17.760 --> 2:29:22.120]  The last thing we would do would be get, get, get whipped into this frenzy.
[2:29:22.120 --> 2:29:23.120]  Right.
[2:29:23.120 --> 2:29:28.680]  And, and also it's completely absurd to say that we were attempting to commit an insurrection
[2:29:28.680 --> 2:29:29.680]  without guns.
[2:29:29.680 --> 2:29:31.320]  It makes no sense, right?
[2:29:31.320 --> 2:29:36.840]  If we were actually trying to take over the Capitol or commit some kind of insurrection,
[2:29:36.840 --> 2:29:38.960]  we would definitely have brought weapons, right?
[2:29:38.960 --> 2:29:39.960]  This is complete absurdity.
[2:29:39.960 --> 2:29:45.600]  The team leader on the ground, who goes by the name WIP, he is a combat veteran, actually
[2:29:45.600 --> 2:29:49.960]  an explosive expert in the Army, and a triple canopy and black water contractor.
[2:29:49.960 --> 2:29:51.640]  The guy knows what he's doing.
[2:29:51.640 --> 2:29:52.640]  So it's completely ridiculous.
[2:29:52.640 --> 2:29:57.320]  It's actually an insult, insult to his competency to say that he was somehow involved in some
[2:29:57.320 --> 2:29:59.320]  big conspiracy to commit insurrection.
[2:29:59.320 --> 2:30:00.640]  It's just total nonsense.
[2:30:00.640 --> 2:30:02.520]  Well, I can tell you, we were all set up.
[2:30:02.520 --> 2:30:05.120]  We were told there'd be security there, Secret Service, and Capitol Police.
[2:30:05.120 --> 2:30:11.440]  It said the Capitol Police were cut in half, sent on traffic control, and we now know that
[2:30:11.440 --> 2:30:12.440]  that's the case.
[2:30:12.440 --> 2:30:17.920]  And so it was a few hundred Q people, a few Boogaloo's, a few Proud Boys, and a few people
[2:30:17.920 --> 2:30:21.680]  saying they were Road Keepers, some that weren't, were also there, that went in most of them
[2:30:21.680 --> 2:30:25.720]  peaceful within the Velvet Robs, but, but we all know the history of that.
[2:30:25.720 --> 2:30:29.680]  Clearly General Honor read that the gun confiscation in Katrina says he wants war with the American
[2:30:29.680 --> 2:30:30.680]  people.
[2:30:30.680 --> 2:30:35.520]  Secretary of Defense literally is like an anti-white racist, Biden's going ahead with
[2:30:35.520 --> 2:30:36.520]  Black Lives Matter.
[2:30:36.520 --> 2:30:41.680]  Clearly that's their narrative of civil war, and they're going ahead with that.
[2:30:41.680 --> 2:30:43.320]  Where do you see this going?
[2:30:43.320 --> 2:30:49.720]  Well, it's a Stalinistic purge and a Stalinistic persecution campaign, and it's meant to divide
[2:30:49.720 --> 2:30:53.480]  the political right to get everyone to turn on each other, which sadly you're seeing some
[2:30:53.480 --> 2:30:54.480]  do.
[2:30:54.480 --> 2:30:58.600]  You're seeing some people turn on anybody who went inside and condemn them.
[2:30:58.600 --> 2:31:00.080]  And I refuse to do that.
[2:31:00.080 --> 2:31:02.880]  All the guys that went in who were Road Keepers, or even the ones that weren't Road Keepers
[2:31:02.880 --> 2:31:05.280]  that are with Road Keepers, we're standing with them.
[2:31:05.280 --> 2:31:09.280]  We're saying, look, we're going to wait and see, to presume innocence will prove you guilty.
[2:31:09.280 --> 2:31:13.360]  We're going to give them a chance to defend themselves, and articulate why they went in.
[2:31:13.360 --> 2:31:17.640]  But frankly, the way I see it, all I can see is that they walked in like a bunch of other
[2:31:17.640 --> 2:31:21.720]  people did after the breach happened, took a few selfies, and walked back out.
[2:31:21.720 --> 2:31:22.720]  That's not even trespass.
[2:31:22.720 --> 2:31:27.320]  And so what we're seeing, though, is much like the Reichstag fire was used by the Nazi
[2:31:27.320 --> 2:31:31.280]  regime to destroy civil liberties in Germany.
[2:31:31.280 --> 2:31:32.280]  We're seeing the attempt now.
[2:31:32.280 --> 2:31:36.800]  That wasn't even that bad, compared to what has been done by Antifa and BLM across the
[2:31:36.800 --> 2:31:37.800]  country.
[2:31:37.800 --> 2:31:40.560]  They're trying to make it into something worse, far worse than what it was.
[2:31:40.560 --> 2:31:41.560]  Well, that's right.
[2:31:41.560 --> 2:31:46.120]  They were just burning the Portland federal courthouse of people in it two days ago.
[2:31:46.120 --> 2:31:48.240]  The media wouldn't even pick that up, imagine.
[2:31:48.240 --> 2:31:51.680]  But I want to be clear, Stuart, I didn't see any Road Keepers or anything violent or wrong.
[2:31:51.680 --> 2:31:53.680]  Looks like after it was open, they just went in.
[2:31:53.680 --> 2:31:55.960]  But they're worse than Antifa, they're worse than provocateurs.
[2:31:55.960 --> 2:31:59.160]  I think the people that first attacked police were Antifa.
[2:31:59.160 --> 2:32:00.160]  We know that.
[2:32:00.160 --> 2:32:03.240]  And I think there were a few bad actors that pooped on Pelosi's thing.
[2:32:03.240 --> 2:32:04.240]  That's vandalism.
[2:32:04.240 --> 2:32:05.240]  I don't support it.
[2:32:05.240 --> 2:32:06.680]  It made people look bad.
[2:32:06.680 --> 2:32:07.760]  But I do see what you're saying.
[2:32:07.760 --> 2:32:12.000]  We should overall see everybody as innocent until proven guilty, and I don't see evidence
[2:32:12.000 --> 2:32:14.360]  of actually Oath Keepers being violent inside.
[2:32:14.360 --> 2:32:17.440]  Why are they trying to hone in then on Oath Keepers and set them up?
[2:32:17.440 --> 2:32:20.920]  Because it's a big, competent group that had a lot of good military police that are still
[2:32:20.920 --> 2:32:21.920]  in it.
[2:32:21.920 --> 2:32:22.920]  Absolutely.
[2:32:22.920 --> 2:32:24.440]  And they're free of us.
[2:32:24.440 --> 2:32:27.320]  I mean, Antifa on the streets has cured us for years.
[2:32:27.320 --> 2:32:28.320]  That's why it's ironic.
[2:32:28.320 --> 2:32:31.560]  But we've never even had to use force against Antifa.
[2:32:31.560 --> 2:32:35.840]  And the backdrop to this is we protected over a dozen Trump rallies.
[2:32:35.840 --> 2:32:38.640]  People outside of the Trump rallies being escorted by Oath Keepers.
[2:32:38.640 --> 2:32:44.320]  We were at all three of the events in D.C., the protests after the election was stolen.
[2:32:44.320 --> 2:32:47.480]  In November, in December, and doing the exact same mission.
[2:32:47.480 --> 2:32:51.120]  Our guys are wearing helmets and body armor because they're there to protect people against
[2:32:51.120 --> 2:32:52.120]  Antifa.
[2:32:52.120 --> 2:32:55.600]  And Antifa has to hit you in the head with hard objects, like to stab people, and then
[2:32:55.600 --> 2:32:56.600]  throw crap in your eyes.
[2:32:56.600 --> 2:33:00.600]  And so that's why our guys were wearing body armor and helmets and body armor.
[2:33:00.600 --> 2:33:01.600]  Sure.
[2:33:01.600 --> 2:33:03.720]  What do you think of all the footage left that is dressing up by Trump supporters?
[2:33:03.720 --> 2:33:07.360]  I mean, we know, even in Time Magazine, they bragged a month ago that they actually went
[2:33:07.360 --> 2:33:08.360]  and helped stir this up.
[2:33:08.360 --> 2:33:12.360]  I mean, CNN paid Jaynex, you know, $70,000-something.
[2:33:12.360 --> 2:33:15.800]  But we saw it on the streets in November and December.
[2:33:15.800 --> 2:33:20.480]  We saw Antifa posing as Trump supporters, and, you know, they had no discipline, though.
[2:33:20.480 --> 2:33:23.840]  They wanted to be getting shouting matches with Trump supporters, and they're pretty
[2:33:23.840 --> 2:33:24.840]  easy to pick out.
[2:33:24.840 --> 2:33:29.000]  So, absolutely, there were Antifa on the ground there in D.C., there always are.
[2:33:29.000 --> 2:33:32.840]  And yes, they were masquerading, some of them were masquerading those Trump supporters.
[2:33:32.840 --> 2:33:33.840]  They always do that.
[2:33:33.840 --> 2:33:39.080]  So, it's completely no surprise, and it's an absolute lie for the FBI to testify that
[2:33:39.080 --> 2:33:41.560]  there was no Antifa on the ground at the Capitol.
[2:33:41.560 --> 2:33:43.560]  It's a complete nonsense.
[2:33:43.560 --> 2:33:46.520]  Stuart Rhodes, we've got a few minutes left, and we'll do five minutes on the side before
[2:33:46.520 --> 2:33:47.760]  Paul Watson takes over.
[2:33:47.760 --> 2:33:52.320]  But I think it's going to blow up in their face if they indict you, because I know for
[2:33:52.320 --> 2:33:56.120]  a fact that you weren't involved in that idiocy that day.
[2:33:56.120 --> 2:33:57.920]  Well, it's not only that.
[2:33:57.920 --> 2:34:03.000]  I mean, I regard every one of our guys right now, even the ones who went in as political
[2:34:03.000 --> 2:34:07.560]  prisoners, because, like I said, for the most part, all they do is walk in and take a few
[2:34:07.560 --> 2:34:08.560]  selfies.
[2:34:08.560 --> 2:34:11.960]  And I think what I anticipate what their defense is going to be for some of them is they went
[2:34:11.960 --> 2:34:18.120]  in to actually help police officers and help them to get the safety, like one small female
[2:34:18.120 --> 2:34:19.920]  officer is being overwhelmed by larger males.
[2:34:19.920 --> 2:34:23.520]  I believe it will come out that our guys actually helped rescue her.
[2:34:23.520 --> 2:34:28.640]  And so, if other events like that, whether it actually were directly assisting law enforcement,
[2:34:28.640 --> 2:34:31.200]  I think it's going to come out and also bring a medical aid.
[2:34:31.200 --> 2:34:35.880]  And so, like I said, I think it's incredibly important for the conservative right to look
[2:34:35.880 --> 2:34:39.640]  at these people as political prisoners and to do what the leftists do.
[2:34:39.640 --> 2:34:42.080]  Trump has always circled the wagons.
[2:34:42.080 --> 2:34:43.080]  They bail out people that shoot cops.
[2:34:43.080 --> 2:34:44.080]  We shoot you.
[2:34:44.080 --> 2:34:45.080]  Stay right there.
[2:34:45.080 --> 2:34:48.200]  We're going to be back with Stewart Rhodes, O Keepers dot org, five more minutes.
[2:34:48.200 --> 2:34:52.560]  And Paul Joseph Watts is taking over, remember, go there, check them out because they're good
[2:34:52.560 --> 2:34:55.160]  people and they're not going to be able to get the truth out if they're able to silence
[2:34:55.160 --> 2:34:56.160]  them and shut them down.
[2:34:56.160 --> 2:34:57.640]  And once they shut them down, they can lie about them.
[2:34:57.640 --> 2:34:58.640]  Same thing with Info Wars.
[2:34:58.640 --> 2:34:59.640]  They can silence us.
[2:34:59.640 --> 2:35:01.640]  They can then frame us and frame the Liberty Movement.
[2:35:01.640 --> 2:35:02.640]  Keep us on air.
[2:35:02.640 --> 2:35:03.960]  Pre-shipping ends Thursday.
[2:35:03.960 --> 2:35:08.760]  Storewide, infowarstore.com, Alpha Power, Great Brain Neutropic.
[2:35:08.760 --> 2:35:12.160]  People have it sold out for months back in stock, 50% off free shipping.
[2:35:12.160 --> 2:35:15.720]  That will extend after Wednesday or Thursday.
[2:35:15.720 --> 2:35:18.280]  But everything else, the big sale has to end.
[2:35:18.280 --> 2:35:21.920]  Infowarstore.com, that's how we fund our operations, whether it's X2 or whether it's
[2:35:21.920 --> 2:35:25.360]  Brainforce Plus or whether it's Turboforce, it's all there.
[2:35:25.360 --> 2:35:29.000]  Vaso Beach back in stock with a very limited supply and it's all selling out.
[2:35:29.000 --> 2:35:32.280]  The privacy pockets to protect yourself from being tracked down and out.
[2:35:32.280 --> 2:35:36.200]  This amazing liquid sleep bait, it's like rocket rest, but liquid way stronger than
[2:35:36.200 --> 2:35:37.200]  a knockout.
[2:35:37.200 --> 2:35:38.200]  I'm not saying you want that.
[2:35:38.200 --> 2:35:39.200]  You want something way stronger.
[2:35:39.200 --> 2:35:40.200]  It's there.
[2:35:40.200 --> 2:35:41.200]  It's really good.
[2:35:41.200 --> 2:35:42.200]  Infowarstore.com.
[2:35:42.200 --> 2:35:45.200]  Hour number four, finishing up with Stuart Rhodes and then Paul Joseph Spicer.
[2:35:45.200 --> 2:35:48.200]  How that was done.
[2:35:48.200 --> 2:35:52.680]  Humanity has been domesticated by and large.
[2:35:52.680 --> 2:35:56.520]  The population has been trained to submit, do what you're told, and it's all going to
[2:35:56.520 --> 2:35:57.520]  pass.
[2:35:57.520 --> 2:36:01.080]  But if you study authoritarians, if you study the globalists, you understand that they reach
[2:36:01.080 --> 2:36:05.240]  a point where all the training is just beta and you go into the point of being cold, being
[2:36:05.240 --> 2:36:09.360]  totally enslaved, and because the globalists see us as weak and see us as stupid, they
[2:36:09.360 --> 2:36:10.920]  are now making that move.
[2:36:10.920 --> 2:36:15.040]  And they are collapsing the third world with their economic weapons to then flood us with
[2:36:15.040 --> 2:36:20.720]  the third world that the UN will use as a weapon to then have us under such a crisis,
[2:36:20.720 --> 2:36:25.680]  under such a load, capitulate to the UN, whatever agreements they want us to sign, hoping that
[2:36:25.680 --> 2:36:31.320]  they will stop the flood of tens of millions of refugees, not fleeing COVID or climate
[2:36:31.320 --> 2:36:35.960]  change as the UN and Klaus Schwab are saying, and Bill Gates are saying, but fleeing the
[2:36:35.960 --> 2:36:41.960]  year-long lockdowns that the UN and Bill Gates ordered them to institute or they wouldn't
[2:36:41.960 --> 2:36:47.800]  get more IMF and World Bank money, and that's why we have to really get educated about the
[2:36:47.800 --> 2:36:48.800]  globalists.
[2:36:48.800 --> 2:36:52.640]  Cognitive dissonance is a major issue amongst the left.
[2:36:52.640 --> 2:36:56.960]  It can be very stressful dealing with facts you refuse to accept.
[2:36:56.960 --> 2:37:01.640]  If you have a family member suffering from this degenerative mental condition, buy them
[2:37:01.640 --> 2:37:06.160]  a bottle of ultimate fish oil from InfowarsStore.com.
[2:37:06.160 --> 2:37:10.920]  Studies have suggested that fish oils and fish oil supplementation can slightly lower
[2:37:10.920 --> 2:37:16.680]  blood pressure, decrease triglyceride levels, decrease the growth rate of plaque, and provide
[2:37:16.680 --> 2:37:22.680]  a soothing reduction in inflammatory responses in joints and the digestive system.
[2:37:22.680 --> 2:37:29.360]  Recent studies have suggested that high EPA and DHA fish oil can stimulate immune function
[2:37:29.360 --> 2:37:33.960]  by increasing the concentration and activity of immune cells.
[2:37:33.960 --> 2:37:39.880]  It worked for my family, and now I can have a logical and calm discussion about actual
[2:37:39.880 --> 2:37:42.560]  facts that pertain to reality.
[2:37:42.560 --> 2:37:49.800]  Get your ultimate fish oil for a friend, family member, or yourself at InfowarsStore.com.
[2:37:49.800 --> 2:37:54.520]  I've been thinking a lot lately about playing devil's advocate on there.
[2:37:54.520 --> 2:37:57.800]  About looking at the world from the perspective of the globalists, that the public is so
[2:37:57.800 --> 2:38:01.400]  dumbed down that they don't care that we're stealing their future from them, that we're
[2:38:01.400 --> 2:38:05.560]  poisoning them, that we're sterilizing them, that they deserve to be killed.
[2:38:05.560 --> 2:38:08.000]  Yes, that's the position of the globalists.
[2:38:08.000 --> 2:38:13.040]  They play God, and they think because we don't stand up, they have a right to do this to
[2:38:13.040 --> 2:38:14.040]  us.
[2:38:14.040 --> 2:38:16.480]  And I've told you that the globalists have tried to hire me.
[2:38:16.480 --> 2:38:21.440]  They've tried to get me to join them, but metaphysically at a spiritual level, I have
[2:38:21.440 --> 2:38:22.440]  the Holy Spirit.
[2:38:22.440 --> 2:38:26.240]  I'm the connection with God, and I know that God does not like that, so I cannot join the
[2:38:26.240 --> 2:38:27.240]  enemy.
[2:38:27.240 --> 2:38:31.920]  But I'll tell you, at a selfish level, I get very, very mad at people that go along with
[2:38:31.920 --> 2:38:36.320]  the system, believing you're part of it or believing you're getting power along with it.
[2:38:36.320 --> 2:38:42.120]  Whether you're just a steelworker or a schoolteacher or a Henry Kissinger, you're not God.
[2:38:42.120 --> 2:38:46.960]  And treating other people like they're animals and you're God is something that the real God
[2:38:46.960 --> 2:38:50.400]  of the universe doesn't like, and that's a fact.
[2:38:50.400 --> 2:38:53.560]  My enemies are your enemies.
[2:38:53.560 --> 2:38:55.040]  They're the globalists, they're the extremists.
[2:38:55.040 --> 2:39:01.040]  They are a consortium of mad scientists, pedophiles, control freaks, devil worshipers,
[2:39:01.040 --> 2:39:06.280]  vampires, wherever you want to call them, that are highly predatory, and are setting
[2:39:06.280 --> 2:39:13.240]  up a false fantasy-land system of constant bombardment of propaganda, drugs, and electromagnetic
[2:39:13.240 --> 2:39:20.640]  radiation to change the very DNA of the human species, to mutate us into a form that they
[2:39:20.640 --> 2:39:24.560]  can control like a pawn on a chessboard.
[2:39:24.560 --> 2:39:29.200]  The bottom line is they want to play God, and they are playing God, and the news is
[2:39:29.200 --> 2:39:31.920]  only going to tighten around our necks from year on out.
[2:39:31.920 --> 2:39:35.880]  So many other people want to be positive, they want to put out fake news, and want to
[2:39:35.880 --> 2:39:39.600]  not only cover limited amounts of what's happening with New World Order, but at the end of the
[2:39:39.600 --> 2:39:43.000]  day it's all about the population, it's all about world government, it's all about the
[2:39:43.000 --> 2:39:47.560]  end of the human system as we know it, and on its actions, a nightmare being built, only
[2:39:47.560 --> 2:39:53.080]  admitting it can turn around and stop it.
[2:39:53.080 --> 2:40:01.520]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[2:40:01.520 --> 2:40:11.160]  I've got a time to find a tale to explain to see, I won't be much when you get through
[2:40:11.160 --> 2:40:16.720]  with me, I'm losing weight and I'm turning by the tale.
[2:40:16.720 --> 2:40:24.160]  I've been interviewing Stuart Rudge before those keepers even existed, and at that dinner
[2:40:24.160 --> 2:40:28.360]  with him probably 20 times, and he's gone all over the country from the Bundy Ranch
[2:40:28.360 --> 2:40:32.920]  to what happened in Oregon to Austin, Texas, and he's done thousands of events, I know
[2:40:32.920 --> 2:40:37.960]  of, probably 50 events I've been at or more, and he's always had great people and quality
[2:40:37.960 --> 2:40:40.720]  folks that aren't provocaturing around him.
[2:40:40.720 --> 2:40:45.440]  The Proud Boys, a lot of nice people, but it was so new, so big, they couldn't control
[2:40:45.440 --> 2:40:51.120]  it, and I'd say 95% good people, but they had some bad guys in there, Boogaloo's won
[2:40:51.120 --> 2:40:56.240]  a revolution, but they got some good people, some bad people in them, but the old keepers
[2:40:56.240 --> 2:41:00.960]  is what the system is really, really afraid of, that's why he saw senior retired FBI agents
[2:41:00.960 --> 2:41:04.520]  and senior military people in it, because it's got a good mission, Stuart Rudge is
[2:41:04.520 --> 2:41:10.120]  a smart guy, he won awards for his law work, for his papers on these very top of scenarios
[2:41:10.120 --> 2:41:14.520]  we see right now, and I understand Rudge has gotten apocalyptic, and I'm being point blank
[2:41:14.520 --> 2:41:19.200]  with him, and he can be critical of me, because I got mad at a lot of folks that went in,
[2:41:19.200 --> 2:41:22.280]  just because they got suckered in, I get it, the left is burning down buildings, the left
[2:41:22.280 --> 2:41:25.520]  is killing cops, and they're little angel cakes burning down whole neighborhoods, and
[2:41:25.520 --> 2:41:29.560]  this point is a few hundred people going out of a million, and we don't know who's innocent
[2:41:29.560 --> 2:41:35.360]  and who isn't, and so just back them 100%, I get that, I was just irritated because
[2:41:35.360 --> 2:41:41.920]  I saw how they used it against us, but regardless, we shouldn't just accept national gun confiscation,
[2:41:41.920 --> 2:41:46.360]  because Putin even called this a stroll down to the capitol, and the Russians are making
[2:41:46.360 --> 2:41:51.320]  jokes about it, because they clearly see the police stood down, and so Stuart, I get it,
[2:41:51.320 --> 2:41:55.320]  America's being taken over by Chinese, they're butchering the Bill of Rights and Constitution,
[2:41:55.320 --> 2:41:59.160]  they're purging the military, Biden says he's going to confiscate the guns, they're coming
[2:41:59.160 --> 2:42:04.600]  out with force inoculations, the borders are wide open, yes, by any historical yardstick,
[2:42:04.600 --> 2:42:11.280]  we have every right to declare 1776 part two, I just instinctively look at that, and realize
[2:42:11.280 --> 2:42:15.840]  how they've set this up politically, and how they want a civil war so China can take over,
[2:42:15.840 --> 2:42:19.560]  and I'm really trying to get the governors and the political system moving to stop this,
[2:42:19.560 --> 2:42:24.480]  you may be right, that there's no way to fix it, or is there a way to fix it, because
[2:42:24.480 --> 2:42:28.160]  they're claiming you want violence, they're claiming you want offensive stuff, that's
[2:42:28.160 --> 2:42:32.240]  not the man I know, but at the same time, if we're attacked, we have a right to duty
[2:42:32.240 --> 2:42:36.800]  to protect ourselves, so we far past the Declaration of Independence point, nobody can deny that,
[2:42:36.800 --> 2:42:39.640]  there's plenty of cowards in the government, they're going to keep appeasing the system
[2:42:39.640 --> 2:42:42.960]  forever, but there is a point at which the globalists are going to push, where there
[2:42:42.960 --> 2:42:46.440]  is a breaking point, I don't want that breaking point, but it is approaching.
[2:42:46.440 --> 2:42:52.160]  Well, we're now on the same path with Downers Walk, and we need to look at their wisdom,
[2:42:52.160 --> 2:42:56.920]  and do the same thing they did, and Jefferson and Madison told us exactly what they do,
[2:42:56.920 --> 2:43:01.840]  and it is nullification by the states, and by your county governments, and your sheriff,
[2:43:01.840 --> 2:43:06.240]  but also backed up by you, the most important office in this country is who is your local
[2:43:06.240 --> 2:43:11.080]  sheriff, and that sheriff means a posse of all the able-bodied men in the county behind
[2:43:11.080 --> 2:43:14.920]  you, that's the right way to do it, and so yes, the states need to stand up, and some
[2:43:14.920 --> 2:43:18.280]  are beginning to do that, and you've also got to go down to the county level, so my
[2:43:18.280 --> 2:43:23.920]  encouragement to everyone out there is to become strong locally, strong in your neighborhoods,
[2:43:23.920 --> 2:43:28.520]  strong in yourself, strong in your church, your town, your county, and come together
[2:43:28.520 --> 2:43:32.560]  so that you stand strong together, that's the wisdom of the Founding Fathers, they didn't
[2:43:32.560 --> 2:43:38.560]  hide in their homes waiting one at a time to be arrested by the bad guys, they got together.
[2:43:38.560 --> 2:43:42.600]  They didn't hide in their homes waiting for Q to save them.
[2:43:42.600 --> 2:43:47.280]  Or that, yeah, so you've got to come together, and nullification at the local level is the
[2:43:47.280 --> 2:43:48.280]  right thing.
[2:43:48.280 --> 2:43:53.480]  Whether it's resisting election fraud, assisting on paper ballots, or whether it's resisting
[2:43:53.480 --> 2:43:58.720]  gun confiscation down the road, you need to come together, that's what you need to do.
[2:43:58.720 --> 2:44:01.720]  I admire you under this much pressure, because you know, they're criminally investigating
[2:44:01.720 --> 2:44:04.800]  me too, and Roger Stone and the rest of it, but I know it's all ass and I, and I used
[2:44:04.800 --> 2:44:08.160]  to laugh at Roger when they said they were investigating him for Russiagate until they
[2:44:08.160 --> 2:44:11.200]  had died at him, and I was like, wow, this is real, because I know we had no connection
[2:44:11.200 --> 2:44:14.960]  to the Russians, they criminally investigated me and my father, everybody tried to get people
[2:44:14.960 --> 2:44:19.560]  to lie about us, that's really, I think should be your biggest concern is them trying to
[2:44:19.560 --> 2:44:24.520]  turn a health keeper out of the thousands of members to lie about you when there's
[2:44:24.520 --> 2:44:25.520]  no evidence.
[2:44:25.520 --> 2:44:28.600]  But I don't think the American people will buy into that, plus the average health keeper
[2:44:28.600 --> 2:44:32.760]  is of such good quality, I think they're going to have a major problem getting an health
[2:44:32.760 --> 2:44:35.240]  keeper to bear false witness against you.
[2:44:35.240 --> 2:44:39.920]  Yeah, that's the obvious strategy is to try to force someone, you know, threaten them
[2:44:39.920 --> 2:44:44.560]  with 20, 30 years in prison, and try to force them, like you said, into making up lies.
[2:44:44.560 --> 2:44:47.400]  But hey, this is the fight we're in, and I'll deal with it.
[2:44:47.400 --> 2:44:48.400]  We're going to bear it.
[2:44:48.400 --> 2:44:49.400]  We're going to bear it right now.
[2:44:49.400 --> 2:44:54.000]  I do want to plug one fundraiser for one of our men that that's, and his wife actually,
[2:44:54.000 --> 2:44:56.840]  both, both Kelly and Connie Megs.
[2:44:56.840 --> 2:45:04.160]  So if you can go to go, give send go.com forward slash Megs, M-E-G-G-S, there was a fundraiser
[2:45:04.160 --> 2:45:06.160]  with their, with their legal defense.
[2:45:06.160 --> 2:45:10.040]  And slow down for us, guys, pull that up from the front on screen, because your, your audio
[2:45:10.040 --> 2:45:14.480]  is okay, but it's a little muddy, slowly tell us who this is, what happened to him, and
[2:45:14.480 --> 2:45:15.480]  how people donate.
[2:45:15.480 --> 2:45:16.480]  Right.
[2:45:16.480 --> 2:45:23.080]  Give, give send go.com forward slash Megs, and that is for Kelly Megs.
[2:45:23.080 --> 2:45:24.560]  He was our Florida team leader.
[2:45:24.560 --> 2:45:30.760]  They were assigned to do the PSD detail for the stop to steal people and his wife, Connie,
[2:45:30.760 --> 2:45:32.880]  so Kelly and Connie Megs.
[2:45:32.880 --> 2:45:36.640]  And if you want to also help those keepers, go to those people.org forward slash donate
[2:45:36.640 --> 2:45:40.480]  and you can support the organization because we're going to have to hire lawyers to fight
[2:45:40.480 --> 2:45:45.920]  back against the defamation from, from Benny Thompson, from Mississippi, the congressman,
[2:45:45.920 --> 2:45:48.920]  who's defamed us by calling us white supremacists, which is ridiculous.
[2:45:48.920 --> 2:45:53.720]  My vice president is a black cop out of Montana, and our team leader on the ground DC that
[2:45:53.720 --> 2:45:55.720]  day was a black, black cop back there.
[2:45:55.720 --> 2:46:00.280]  I mean, you were here with your buddies black just the other day, but a few weeks ago.
[2:46:00.280 --> 2:46:06.040]  But, but, but Stuart, it's well known that you're an anti-racist organization, pro-America.
[2:46:06.040 --> 2:46:09.040]  That is not, they call you a white supremacist everywhere on TV.
[2:46:09.040 --> 2:46:11.880]  Well, we'll be soon for defamation.
[2:46:11.880 --> 2:46:15.600]  So that'll be, they're going to get their comeuppance because we're going to sue them
[2:46:15.600 --> 2:46:20.400]  for defamation of character against, against all of our members, probably about tops, about
[2:46:20.400 --> 2:46:22.600]  60,000 total current and former members.
[2:46:22.600 --> 2:46:23.600]  So that's a class action.
[2:46:23.600 --> 2:46:26.480]  I mean, they just call the 60,000 people white supremacists.
[2:46:26.480 --> 2:46:27.480]  Right.
[2:46:27.480 --> 2:46:29.480]  So we'll be soon for that.
[2:46:29.480 --> 2:46:33.080]  And when we get out of that, we're going to turn towards legal defense for all the people
[2:46:33.080 --> 2:46:35.080]  out there that are being persecuted.
[2:46:35.080 --> 2:46:36.720]  That's what we're going to do.
[2:46:36.720 --> 2:46:41.800]  While I admire the fact you're on the offense, obviously I've been advised by a lot of folks
[2:46:41.800 --> 2:46:42.800]  out there.
[2:46:42.800 --> 2:46:43.800]  Hey, you better stay away from Stuart Rhodes.
[2:46:43.800 --> 2:46:44.800]  They're going to get him.
[2:46:44.800 --> 2:46:45.800]  They're going to get us all.
[2:46:45.800 --> 2:46:47.800]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is a fight we chose.
[2:46:47.800 --> 2:46:48.800]  It's a takeover.
[2:46:48.800 --> 2:46:50.160]  And the globalists want America out of the way.
[2:46:50.160 --> 2:46:51.840]  They want us totally bankrupted.
[2:46:51.840 --> 2:46:54.880]  That's Joe Biden's job, cut off our energy, open our borders.
[2:46:54.880 --> 2:46:55.880]  People don't get this.
[2:46:55.880 --> 2:46:58.760]  This is an old fashioned liberal undermining the pillars of the city.
[2:46:58.760 --> 2:47:01.240]  They intend to bring it down right now, Stuart.
[2:47:01.240 --> 2:47:05.680]  What do you predict the puppet of the chai comms Biden and their beachhead in DC are going
[2:47:05.680 --> 2:47:06.680]  to do next?
[2:47:06.680 --> 2:47:11.520]  Well, I mean, I actually hope they go for a full blown assault with this ban because
[2:47:11.520 --> 2:47:13.960]  that's what's going to take the weight of most Americans up.
[2:47:13.960 --> 2:47:15.560]  So they need to see what's really happening.
[2:47:15.560 --> 2:47:17.440]  I think the faster they go, the better.
[2:47:17.440 --> 2:47:22.400]  I'll let them go ahead and take off the mask all the way and make them declare your rights
[2:47:22.400 --> 2:47:23.400]  no one boy.
[2:47:23.400 --> 2:47:26.800]  That way Americans will finally rise up and stand up for their rights.
[2:47:26.800 --> 2:47:30.480]  And you're going to have to do it in your towns and counties and in your states.
[2:47:30.480 --> 2:47:35.640]  So I think you need to focus local on your sheriff, who your mayor is, makes a difference
[2:47:35.640 --> 2:47:36.640]  to your local judge.
[2:47:36.640 --> 2:47:37.640]  No, I agree.
[2:47:37.640 --> 2:47:38.640]  That's why they're scared.
[2:47:38.640 --> 2:47:41.600]  Because you peacefully reach out to local government and get them on board constitutionally.
[2:47:41.600 --> 2:47:45.800]  When all Biden's offering is bankruptcy and race war, clearly they stole the election.
[2:47:45.800 --> 2:47:50.640]  If they were smart, they would back off, they've got control and slowly keep running the country
[2:47:50.640 --> 2:47:51.640]  in the ground.
[2:47:51.640 --> 2:47:55.640]  I think it shows their weakness that they're accelerating this right now.
[2:47:55.640 --> 2:47:56.640]  Absolutely.
[2:47:56.640 --> 2:48:01.960]  And so I think what we're seeing now is a suppression campaign like we were interviewed by Gateway
[2:48:01.960 --> 2:48:07.360]  Pundit and that article, that interview we did, myself and my attorney, has been suppressed
[2:48:07.360 --> 2:48:09.320]  across the board, across the internet.
[2:48:09.320 --> 2:48:13.200]  They don't want an alternative narrative to get out there, like telling the truth about
[2:48:13.200 --> 2:48:15.680]  who we are and what we did on January 6th.
[2:48:15.680 --> 2:48:19.600]  If you have a New York Times smear piece, that's not suppressed.
[2:48:19.600 --> 2:48:23.480]  But the national video interview with me and our attorney is suppressed.
[2:48:23.480 --> 2:48:24.480]  That's what you're going to see going forward.
[2:48:24.480 --> 2:48:28.680]  So people need to understand that they want you to turn on each other, that I was pressured
[2:48:28.680 --> 2:48:30.640]  to disavow oath keepers.
[2:48:30.640 --> 2:48:34.960]  And our credit card process has shut us down and they insist that I must disavow any oath
[2:48:34.960 --> 2:48:37.880]  keeper that was arrested and I refuse to do it.
[2:48:37.880 --> 2:48:39.640]  Don't give in to that pressure.
[2:48:39.640 --> 2:48:40.640]  Absolutely.
[2:48:40.640 --> 2:48:42.640]  And we're going to put that article on screen from GatewayPundit.com.
[2:48:42.640 --> 2:48:45.920]  We're going to link it in the live show feed today, exclusive interview, oath keepers founder
[2:48:45.920 --> 2:48:49.640]  Stuart Rhodes speaks out after being demonized for the left, deep state video.
[2:48:49.640 --> 2:48:52.160]  They're going to try to suppress this interview as well.
[2:48:52.160 --> 2:48:59.920]  What would you want to call this, FBI person number one, a leader of oath keepers sets the
[2:48:59.920 --> 2:49:00.920]  record straight?
[2:49:00.920 --> 2:49:01.920]  Or what should we call this interview?
[2:49:01.920 --> 2:49:02.920]  Badge of honor.
[2:49:02.920 --> 2:49:03.920]  So I'll take it as a badge of honor.
[2:49:03.920 --> 2:49:09.160]  That's when you know you're over the target and you're getting black.
[2:49:09.160 --> 2:49:10.920]  And hey, we're the canaries in the coal mine.
[2:49:10.920 --> 2:49:14.560]  Folks out there do understand the real target is you.
[2:49:14.560 --> 2:49:18.560]  Every Trump supporter, every patriot, they want you and they want you to be silenced
[2:49:18.560 --> 2:49:20.680]  and they want you to chill your own speech.
[2:49:20.680 --> 2:49:24.520]  They want you to help with your own demise by sitting down and shutting up.
[2:49:24.520 --> 2:49:25.520]  That's right.
[2:49:25.520 --> 2:49:26.520]  They know they stole the election.
[2:49:26.520 --> 2:49:27.520]  They're trying to intimidate us.
[2:49:27.520 --> 2:49:29.440]  That isn't going to, that's the wrong action.
[2:49:29.440 --> 2:49:30.960]  Why are they so stupid?
[2:49:30.960 --> 2:49:31.960]  Yeah.
[2:49:31.960 --> 2:49:36.200]  Well, so what you need to do, we need to have, frankly, we need, we need a, uh, Occupy Wall
[2:49:36.200 --> 2:49:42.320]  Street 2.0 that is both left and right, focused on the oligarchs at the very top versus believe
[2:49:42.320 --> 2:49:45.320]  the people and understand what's really happening here.
[2:49:45.320 --> 2:49:46.880]  It's not about left and right.
[2:49:46.880 --> 2:49:48.480]  It's about the oligarchs versus us.
[2:49:48.480 --> 2:49:53.200]  And as you know, so I encourage us, I encourage everyone out there to look towards doing some
[2:49:53.200 --> 2:49:55.200]  kind of an Occupy Wall Street 2.0.
[2:49:55.200 --> 2:49:56.200]  No, I agree.
[2:49:56.200 --> 2:49:58.320]  I'm asking you, what do you want to title this interview?
[2:49:58.320 --> 2:50:04.240]  Um, hey, I titled an interview, how about this, titled interview, uh, Alexander Shultz
[2:50:04.240 --> 2:50:05.840]  and Ethan Speaks Out.
[2:50:05.840 --> 2:50:09.560]  America's Alexander Shultz and Ethan Speaks Out.
[2:50:09.560 --> 2:50:11.640]  Hey, that's, I'll take that one.
[2:50:11.640 --> 2:50:15.880]  It's, uh, person number one, America's Alexander Shultz and Ethan Speaks Out.
[2:50:15.880 --> 2:50:16.880]  All right.
[2:50:16.880 --> 2:50:18.520]  Stuart Rhodes, we appreciate you.
[2:50:18.520 --> 2:50:19.520]  Be safe, my friend.
[2:50:19.520 --> 2:50:23.840]  You're totally innocent of everything except being a faithful, good American, Oathkeepers.org.
[2:50:23.840 --> 2:50:25.520]  Hope to talk to you soon.
[2:50:25.520 --> 2:50:27.800]  Come to the studio whenever you like and, uh, come in here with your lawyer.
[2:50:27.800 --> 2:50:29.680]  I'd love to get you both on.
[2:50:29.680 --> 2:50:32.720]  And of course that evil black fellow that's party organization you had with you here last
[2:50:32.720 --> 2:50:33.720]  week.
[2:50:33.720 --> 2:50:34.720]  All right.
[2:50:34.720 --> 2:50:35.720]  That's why it's a premise.
[2:50:35.720 --> 2:50:38.880]  We'll be right back with Paul Joseph Watson.
[2:50:38.880 --> 2:50:42.800]  Blisters ask me all the time, why do you have multiple multivitamins?
[2:50:42.800 --> 2:50:45.400]  Why do you have multiple high quality iodine?
[2:50:45.400 --> 2:50:46.400]  Why do you do that?
[2:50:46.400 --> 2:50:48.600]  Because different strokes for different folks.
[2:50:48.600 --> 2:50:53.080]  If we're talking to researchers and scientists and they say, Hey, a lot of people love deeper
[2:50:53.080 --> 2:50:57.120]  of pure crystal iodine, but you should put one out with deeper crystal iodine and the
[2:50:57.120 --> 2:51:00.120]  two other types because some people can't absorb pure iodine.
[2:51:00.120 --> 2:51:01.120]  Boom.
[2:51:01.120 --> 2:51:02.120]  We did it.
[2:51:02.120 --> 2:51:03.120]  It's popular.
[2:51:03.120 --> 2:51:04.120]  It's X3.
[2:51:04.120 --> 2:51:05.120]  Is it better than X2?
[2:51:05.120 --> 2:51:06.120]  You decide.
[2:51:06.120 --> 2:51:07.120]  It's different strokes for different folks.
[2:51:07.120 --> 2:51:11.760]  Well, now we have a compliment to knock out our very popular powdered pill, uh, sleeping.
[2:51:11.760 --> 2:51:13.200]  And that is down and out.
[2:51:13.200 --> 2:51:18.080]  It's super strong, way stronger, uh, than knockout, but they don't compete with each other.
[2:51:18.080 --> 2:51:22.880]  Different strokes for different folks, different formulas, and it's 40% off out of the gates
[2:51:22.880 --> 2:51:25.000]  at m4store.com and free shipping.
[2:51:25.000 --> 2:51:28.080]  To cure your down and out today and while you're sleeping, you know you're funding the

[2:51:33.040 --> 2:51:40.040]  shipping.
[2:51:40.040 --> 2:51:43.480]  I don't like coming to you and saying this could be our last broadcast.
[2:51:43.480 --> 2:51:47.680]  Hell, I've been on there 27 years and only the last year or so have I said that.
[2:51:47.680 --> 2:51:50.880]  But let me tell you, the new world orders breathe them down our neck.
[2:51:50.880 --> 2:51:54.000]  The big, globalist publications are coming after us and they're doing everything they
[2:51:54.000 --> 2:51:55.320]  can to shut us down.
[2:51:55.320 --> 2:51:59.600]  So please pray to keep info wars on the air and please support the local states you're
[2:51:59.600 --> 2:52:00.600]  listening to as well.
[2:52:00.600 --> 2:52:06.760]  At the same time, go to m4store.com while you still can and get a book, get a film, get
[2:52:06.760 --> 2:52:11.840]  a t-shirt, get some supplements because it's that money that helps us stay on air in the
[2:52:11.840 --> 2:52:13.120]  face of this thing.
[2:52:13.120 --> 2:52:15.240]  I need your help more than ever now.
[2:52:15.240 --> 2:52:19.560]  I want to keep fighting the globalists, but I can't do it if you don't support us.
[2:52:19.560 --> 2:52:24.560]  So pray for us, word of mouth, tell folks about the broadcast however you can, and buy
[2:52:24.560 --> 2:52:29.560]  great products that will enrich you and your family's lives every day at m4store.com.
[2:52:29.560 --> 2:52:34.720]  Whether it's high quality coffee or supplements or books or films, all of it nurtures the
[2:52:34.720 --> 2:52:39.680]  soul, all of it empowers humanity, all of it is pro-human and pro-God.
[2:52:39.680 --> 2:53:08.160]  Thank you so much.
[2:53:10.040 --> 2:53:13.120]  Any time you hear that, it's a cult leader.
[2:53:13.120 --> 2:53:15.400]  It's somebody trying to abuse you, somebody trying to hurt you.
[2:53:15.400 --> 2:53:18.280]  In some cases, somebody trying to rob you or kill you.
[2:53:18.280 --> 2:53:23.600]  There was a New York Times article a few weeks ago saying that critical thinking is a bad
[2:53:23.600 --> 2:53:24.960]  thing.
[2:53:24.960 --> 2:53:30.360]  You shouldn't do too much thinking, it's infectious, it's bad, you shouldn't read the vaccine
[2:53:30.360 --> 2:53:34.160]  inserts, you shouldn't look into Bill Gates, you should just trust what you're told by
[2:53:34.160 --> 2:53:35.160]  the New York Times.
[2:53:35.160 --> 2:53:45.320]  So Tracy Edwards, the president of the Long Island NAACP in New York, m4wars.com has
[2:53:45.320 --> 2:53:50.280]  the article, has come out and said, don't read the insert, don't ask questions, just
[2:53:50.280 --> 2:53:56.760]  get it in your arm, a Joe Biden talking point, and you too can be an undead zombie.
[2:53:56.760 --> 2:53:58.520]  Here she is.
[2:53:58.520 --> 2:54:03.560]  I'm not asking what's in the infusion.
[2:54:03.560 --> 2:54:08.760]  I'm not looking up all of the ingredients in the infusion.
[2:54:08.760 --> 2:54:14.320]  I am sticking out my arm, and I am taking the infusion.
[2:54:14.320 --> 2:54:15.320]  The infusion?
[2:54:15.320 --> 2:54:22.880]  Oh, like the Clintons that for over a decade as governor and governess, also fly the reports
[2:54:22.880 --> 2:54:27.080]  from the prisons and let them sell HIV and hepatitis positive blood to the entire world
[2:54:27.080 --> 2:54:30.600]  and to Bayer Pharmaceutical to put it in their Factor 8 blood product that gave over two
[2:54:30.600 --> 2:54:39.160]  million people hemophilia, hemophiliacs, HIV, and hepatitis A, B, and C. You mean that?
[2:54:39.160 --> 2:54:44.360]  And there she is with Cuomo, the monster behind her in this mask cult saying, I'm not asking,
[2:54:44.360 --> 2:54:46.040]  I'm putting it in me.
[2:54:46.040 --> 2:54:48.960]  You too can be like Marvellous Marvin Hagler.
[2:54:48.960 --> 2:54:59.880]  You too can be like all the other people, Hank Aaron and others that are dying, but then
[2:54:59.880 --> 2:55:04.360]  they get caught all over the world, not just here doing fake inoculations.
[2:55:04.360 --> 2:55:10.480]  Here, let's play that one more time as criminal investigations are launched in Italy after
[2:55:10.480 --> 2:55:11.880]  so many deaths.
[2:55:11.880 --> 2:55:18.240]  Here is this lady telling you, don't ask, don't look, I mean imagine, listen to this,
[2:55:18.240 --> 2:55:22.600]  don't you even ask a question, and there's a bunch of white dudes with a black lady,
[2:55:22.600 --> 2:55:23.600]  they're puppeting.
[2:55:23.600 --> 2:55:28.360]  Here, get up there and tell them, I'm not asking, I'm not reading nothing, I'm just
[2:55:28.360 --> 2:55:32.160]  taking it, don't read the fine print, imagine you're there to buy a car, don't look at
[2:55:32.160 --> 2:55:38.000]  the fine print, just give me that check, but I'm not going to, you want to see the contract,
[2:55:38.000 --> 2:55:46.040]  I'm sorry, you can't see that, why are you a conspiracy, no, no, no, here, let's hear
[2:55:46.040 --> 2:55:48.160]  from that one more time.
[2:55:48.160 --> 2:55:56.360]  I'm not asking what's in the infusion, I'm not looking up all of the ingredients in
[2:55:56.360 --> 2:56:04.000]  the infusion, I am sticking out my arm, and I am taking the infusion.
[2:56:04.000 --> 2:56:07.840]  That's right, you don't ask questions, we're not going to let you fly or have a job you
[2:56:07.840 --> 2:56:12.280]  don't do in the future, and oh, oh, oh, right here, top scientist says it will kill you,
[2:56:12.280 --> 2:56:16.440]  here's another one, NPR admit that will make you breed and create deadly viruses inside
[2:56:16.440 --> 2:56:20.960]  your body, see the fine print's telling you, but it's not on national TV, oh, top cancer
[2:56:20.960 --> 2:56:26.280]  research institute says it gives you cancer, oh my gosh, look at this article right here,
[2:56:26.280 --> 2:56:33.120]  it goes on, oh, I'm not asking what's in the infusion, I'm not reading it, I'm saying
[2:56:33.120 --> 2:56:37.960]  put it my arm around, I'm not asking what's loaded in the revolver, I'm not asking what's
[2:56:37.960 --> 2:56:42.640]  got bullets in it, just I'm sticking it to my head and I'm pulling a trigger, here let's
[2:56:42.640 --> 2:56:46.880]  hear it one more time.
[2:56:46.880 --> 2:56:55.160]  I'm not asking what's in the infusion, I'm not looking up all of the ingredients in the
[2:56:55.160 --> 2:57:02.160]  infusion, I am sticking out my arm and I am taking the infusion.
[2:57:02.160 --> 2:57:06.000]  And I bet if you had a penis you'd stick it in the garbage disposal or in a wood chipper
[2:57:06.000 --> 2:57:11.200]  or maybe in a light socket, excuse me, but man, but that's who the NAACP has put in by
[2:57:11.200 --> 2:57:15.360]  the globalist a hundred years ago to control black people period to make sure they abort
[2:57:15.360 --> 2:57:20.000]  your babies, because I've been around, I protested a lot at abortion clinics even before I got
[2:57:20.000 --> 2:57:24.120]  on air, and it'd always be some black woman or old black man walking up going nobody wants
[2:57:24.120 --> 2:57:28.160]  these black babies, they don't get rid of these black people, they'd always be getting
[2:57:28.160 --> 2:57:33.320]  like a brand new Mercedes and drive off, and they're the ones that oversee like Remfield
[2:57:33.320 --> 2:57:40.640]  slaves, I'm not asking that you get in there and you take that shot and you roll over and
[2:57:40.640 --> 2:57:51.800]  die like a carrot, whoo baby, I knew Trump was in battle, I knew he was surrounded by
[2:57:51.800 --> 2:57:59.080]  black cowards and by double talking agents of the enemy, and a lot of people just couldn't
[2:57:59.080 --> 2:58:04.640]  believe it, they're like, oh no, it's 3G chess, 5G chess, he's invincible, and I understand
[2:58:04.640 --> 2:58:07.840]  how people learn to believe that, because this is scary what's going on, the global
[2:58:07.840 --> 2:58:11.240]  government and the New World Order, and now that people hold up the fact that that's real,
[2:58:11.240 --> 2:58:15.440]  they won't somebody to come save them from, well, Trump sure as hell tried, my gosh, look
[2:58:15.440 --> 2:58:19.760]  at how prescription drug prices just tripled or quadrupled, depending on the drug once
[2:58:19.760 --> 2:58:23.560]  by the silent executive order, we pay the most of anybody in the world, that's just
[2:58:23.560 --> 2:58:27.720]  one case of hundreds of things that Trump had reversed, and now people are going to
[2:58:27.720 --> 2:58:32.480]  feel the sting and the pain, the energy cost, everything else, but what's really illustrated
[2:58:32.480 --> 2:58:37.040]  this is the trial to the Senate, where Trump's own lawyers are attacking him and putting
[2:58:37.040 --> 2:58:42.520]  him down and saying he lost the election and just engaged in all sorts of criminal activity,
[2:58:42.520 --> 2:58:47.400]  because the fix is in folks, the swamp is deep, Trump fought it, but it's up to us to win
[2:58:47.400 --> 2:58:54.400]  it.
[2:58:54.400 --> 2:59:08.400]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[2:59:08.400 --> 2:59:38.360]  Let me first say this is heartbreaking, it's a very emotional issue for a lot of people,
[2:59:38.360 --> 2:59:45.080]  and it's very difficult and challenging, and obviously these CBP facilities are not made
[2:59:45.080 --> 2:59:51.440]  for kids, so one of the reasons or a driving reason why the president has pushed to take
[2:59:51.440 --> 2:59:55.720]  all of the actions that I outlined earlier when Phil asked the question is because we
[2:59:55.720 --> 3:00:02.160]  want to expedite getting these kids out of these CBP facilities as quickly as possible,
[3:00:02.160 --> 3:00:06.040]  and that's our goal and our objective, and into shelters as quickly as possible, then
[3:00:06.040 --> 3:00:10.920]  into sponsored homes while their cases are being considered and adjudicated.
[3:00:10.920 --> 3:00:17.600]  We are trying to work through what was a dismantled and unprepared system because of the role
[3:00:17.600 --> 3:00:19.520]  of the last administration.
[3:00:19.520 --> 3:00:23.400]  It's going to take some time, but we are very clear eyed about what the problems are and
[3:00:23.400 --> 3:00:28.200]  very focused on putting forward solutions.
[3:00:28.200 --> 3:00:34.000]  These are the people, ladies and gentlemen, that told all the illegals to come up here,
[3:00:34.000 --> 3:00:38.960]  tripled their numbers, 360 plus percent increase in fentanyl, a lot of these are kidnapped
[3:00:38.960 --> 3:00:42.680]  kids, the senate reported a lot of them are putting sex slavery, they are giving them
[3:00:42.680 --> 3:00:48.280]  to smugglers, and it all exploded under Biden and now they are blaming Trump.
[3:00:48.280 --> 3:00:52.640]  It's just absolutely insane, the people are showing up in Biden t-shirts, you've seen
[3:00:52.640 --> 3:00:57.760]  the videos, with hundreds of people wearing these shirts, thousands pouring across, it
[3:00:57.760 --> 3:01:03.960]  is totally insane, and they are saying climate change is causing it when it was the COVID
[3:01:03.960 --> 3:01:04.960]  lockdowns.
[3:01:04.960 --> 3:01:08.600]  When they interview people and say we have no food, we are dying, we have to come here
[3:01:08.600 --> 3:01:12.200]  because of the COVID lockdowns and they run right into the arms of Biden and the globalists
[3:01:12.200 --> 3:01:13.200]  that did it.
[3:01:13.200 --> 3:01:16.960]  I'm not going to get these poor starving people, but this is going to bring us down too, and
[3:01:16.960 --> 3:01:20.120]  it was the COVID lockdowns I told you a year ago that would trigger a giant migrant flow
[3:01:20.120 --> 3:01:21.120]  and now they admit that.
[3:01:21.120 --> 3:01:25.240]  All right, Paul Joseph Watson was a little late getting back to his studio in London,
[3:01:25.240 --> 3:01:29.080]  he is getting there, getting set up, we are going to go to him in just a moment and hand
[3:01:29.080 --> 3:01:32.560]  the baton as he takes over the rest of this hour ahead of the war at 3 p.m. central in
[3:01:32.560 --> 3:01:36.200]  about 52 minutes, but first, please don't forget we are literally supported, I want
[3:01:36.200 --> 3:01:40.120]  to thank you all for your support, plus we've got great products you already need, you only
[3:01:40.120 --> 3:01:45.120]  have until Thursday morning and store-wide free shipping has to end, and all those big
[3:01:45.120 --> 3:01:48.960]  sales on all those items have to end, we are selling the privacy pockets at the lowest
[3:01:48.960 --> 3:01:53.800]  price ever at over 50% off, we want everybody to get them, and that has free shipping, the
[3:01:53.800 --> 3:02:00.080]  X2, the X3, the down and out sleep liquid formulas, the supermail vitality, the knockout
[3:02:00.080 --> 3:02:03.960]  sleep support, ultimate krill oil, ultra 12, bottom and B12, one of the tongue, that's
[3:02:03.960 --> 3:02:09.760]  all 40 to 50% off with free shipping has to end on Thursday morning, except for what's
[3:02:09.760 --> 3:02:14.440]  been sold out for three months back in stock, Rainforest Plus are great new tropics, so
[3:02:14.440 --> 3:02:19.760]  popular, 50% off with free shipping, that will be our new sale, it's on sale now and
[3:02:19.760 --> 3:02:23.840]  we'll be extended because we've got a lot of that great product in, but I tell you folks,
[3:02:23.840 --> 3:02:31.520]  you've got to stock up now because, DNA Force Plus, we ordered it back in September, and
[3:02:31.520 --> 3:02:34.360]  we normally get it in two months, we still don't have it because the breakdown of supply
[3:02:34.360 --> 3:02:38.680]  chain and it's our flagship product, so again, that's why it's so hard to get these products,
[3:02:38.680 --> 3:02:42.720]  it's why we get limited amounts in, it's why stuff sells out so fast and it's you supporting
[3:02:42.720 --> 3:02:46.200]  us, we're bringing enough money to stay on there right now, but just barely, so I want
[3:02:46.200 --> 3:02:53.320]  to thank you all for what you've done, infowarstore.com or AAA-253-3139, you can also support my
[3:02:53.320 --> 3:02:58.200]  dad's company, Dr. Jones Naturals, online and that also is a sponsor and funds us as
[3:02:58.200 --> 3:02:59.200]  well.
[3:02:59.200 --> 3:03:10.200]  Okay, Paul Joseph Watson takes over, please stay with us.
[3:03:10.200 --> 3:03:34.040]  Welcome back to the Summit News, we are live, we're going to get into the top story on Summit
[3:03:34.040 --> 3:03:40.000]  News right now, which is about Spotify crossing the Rubicon in to get another form of censorship
[3:03:40.000 --> 3:03:46.760]  with flashbacks of socialist realism, which was when under the Soviet regime, only works
[3:03:46.760 --> 3:03:53.360]  of art that pleased and didn't offend, Joseph Stalin and the Soviet regime would be allowed
[3:03:53.360 --> 3:03:59.080]  to exist, would not be blacklisted, would be funded, we see this in Hollywood, we see
[3:03:59.080 --> 3:04:04.600]  it in mass culture in general and now we see it with song lyrics on Spotify, where they're
[3:04:04.600 --> 3:04:12.880]  literally banning song lyrics and deleting entire tracks from playlists from major artists
[3:04:12.880 --> 3:04:19.120]  because of quote, misinformation in the song lyrics pertaining to COVID-19, they're that
[3:04:19.120 --> 3:04:25.360]  petrified about anyone having any divergent view from the technocratic elites that the
[3:04:25.360 --> 3:04:31.680]  level of censorship is now down to literal song lyrics by popular artists, we're going
[3:04:31.680 --> 3:04:36.920]  to get into that a little bit later on in the show, first though over the past week we've
[3:04:36.920 --> 3:04:42.840]  had yet another tragic incident being exploited for a new moral panic, for a whole raft of
[3:04:42.840 --> 3:04:48.760]  new laws that will do nothing to target the actual problem being raised by these activists
[3:04:48.760 --> 3:04:55.320]  and will only seek and succeed if they get through in quashing more free speech, headline
[3:04:55.320 --> 3:05:02.080]  up on summit news, Cubs Starzy, planned for undercover cops to patrol bars and clubs,
[3:05:02.080 --> 3:05:03.080]  blasted.
[3:05:03.080 --> 3:05:08.480]  Now I remember in the early 2000s, early to mid 2000s, there was actually under the Tony
[3:05:08.480 --> 3:05:15.720]  Blair government in the United Kingdom, discussion plans being made to have undercover cops literally
[3:05:15.720 --> 3:05:22.120]  sit in restaurants and bars to listen out for racist hate speech and then arrest people
[3:05:22.120 --> 3:05:26.560]  for their private conversations in restaurants and pubs.
[3:05:26.560 --> 3:05:31.800]  Of course, last week we had the passage of a hate crime bill in Scotland, which includes
[3:05:31.800 --> 3:05:35.080]  in its provisions, they fail to get it shot down.
[3:05:35.080 --> 3:05:41.400]  The fact that hate crimes can be prosecuted if they arise from private dinner table conversations
[3:05:41.400 --> 3:05:46.560]  inside people's private homes, so this is not even anything that happens in public, anything
[3:05:46.560 --> 3:05:50.520]  that happens on the internet, anything that happens on the street, it's literally in private
[3:05:50.520 --> 3:05:52.120]  homes.
[3:05:52.120 --> 3:05:57.200]  Well now there's an undercover police officer planned to patrol bars and clubs in the UK
[3:05:57.200 --> 3:06:03.160]  to identify potential, quote, pet predatory and suspicious offenders, and this is off the
[3:06:03.160 --> 3:06:08.880]  back of, as I said, the tragic murder, the abduction and murder of a 33-year-old woman
[3:06:08.880 --> 3:06:14.640]  called Sarah Everard, who went missing in Clapham, London, which is about 10 minutes
[3:06:14.640 --> 3:06:21.320]  that way from where I live, she was tragically abducted, murdered, it turned out, by a metropolitan
[3:06:21.320 --> 3:06:28.600]  police officer, she walked home at 9.30pm from Clapham to her home in Brixton after
[3:06:28.600 --> 3:06:30.640]  having visited a friend.
[3:06:30.640 --> 3:06:38.400]  That is not really a safe place to be walking for anyone, male or female, at 9.10pm at night.
[3:06:38.400 --> 3:06:43.840]  We have stabbings in London literally five minutes away from where I live, mainly BAME
[3:06:43.840 --> 3:06:50.120]  on BAME, the stats show it's 75% black or ethnic minority people stabbing each other.
[3:06:50.120 --> 3:06:56.680]  That happens on a regular basis, it happens every weekend in massive numbers, nobody gives
[3:06:56.680 --> 3:07:02.640]  a damn, one woman was tragically murdered and now we have this massive moral panic over
[3:07:02.640 --> 3:07:07.280]  street harassment, misogyny and the targeting of women.
[3:07:07.280 --> 3:07:12.400]  Now what these feminists won't campaign for, and by the way they've been out protesting
[3:07:12.400 --> 3:07:18.400]  yesterday in Parliament Square, the government has hastily reacted to these protests by passing
[3:07:18.400 --> 3:07:22.880]  laws that do nothing to solve the problem and just target free speech.
[3:07:22.880 --> 3:07:27.080]  But none of the feminists, none of the special interest Soros groups, the Black Lives Matter
[3:07:27.080 --> 3:07:33.560]  groups that have hijacked this protest, have for one single second raised a solution that
[3:07:33.560 --> 3:07:38.640]  could actually help women protect themselves against violent predators on the streets and
[3:07:38.640 --> 3:07:42.240]  that is to allow them to be armed.
[3:07:42.240 --> 3:07:46.560]  Not even with firearms, because even if you bring up that debate in the United Kingdom,
[3:07:46.560 --> 3:07:52.760]  you're shot down like an extremist, but in the United Kingdom, women and people in general
[3:07:52.760 --> 3:07:56.320]  are criminalized from being able to engage in self-defense.
[3:07:56.320 --> 3:08:02.240]  It's illegal in the United Kingdom to carry pepper spray and yet we have criminals carrying
[3:08:02.240 --> 3:08:08.960]  firearms, carrying knives, we have mass uncontrolled immigration from extremely dangerous areas
[3:08:08.960 --> 3:08:13.360]  of the world, people coming into London and their level of violence is so much higher
[3:08:13.360 --> 3:08:18.880]  than the gangs that already exist in London that those gangs are having to one-up them
[3:08:18.880 --> 3:08:24.680]  so the violence gets worse and worse and worse, but amongst all this, while the feminists
[3:08:24.680 --> 3:08:32.400]  screech for ACAB and they screech for hate crime laws that ban misogyny as if rapist
[3:08:32.400 --> 3:08:37.840]  predators murderers care about speech on the internet, they're going to attack women anyway,
[3:08:37.840 --> 3:08:43.160]  but there's no call to allow women to defend themselves and that gets to the heart of it
[3:08:43.160 --> 3:08:47.040]  and we're going to get into it more after the break.
[3:08:47.040 --> 3:08:52.160]  The people are awakening, they're taking control of their own environment, cell phones are
[3:08:52.160 --> 3:08:57.960]  an amazing tool, really they're a super computer that's handheld, but big tech, large corporations,
[3:08:57.960 --> 3:09:03.240]  hackers, governments, foreign governments, the CHIComs especially are using this to steal
[3:09:03.240 --> 3:09:07.920]  your data, to share your data, to be able to rig markets when they're able to scoop
[3:09:07.920 --> 3:09:12.760]  up billions of people's data, they can actually predict on record what's going to happen in
[3:09:12.760 --> 3:09:20.840]  mass movements, cutting them out of that data stream absolutely devastates their AI takeover,
[3:09:20.840 --> 3:09:25.160]  in their own words they admit it, so I've been selling privacy pouches and pocket pockets
[3:09:25.160 --> 3:09:29.160]  and things like that for more than a decade and now the units have gotten really lightweight,
[3:09:29.160 --> 3:09:33.800]  they're Faraday cages, they just look like a cloth envelope, they work absolutely great
[3:09:33.800 --> 3:09:38.960]  and it just gives you that security to have power over your data and power over your identity
[3:09:38.960 --> 3:09:41.960]  when you are traveling and don't want big brother to know what you're up to because
[3:09:41.960 --> 3:09:42.960]  it's not their business.

[3:10:59.680 --> 3:11:09.480]  you're listening to the summit.news radio hour with Paul Joseph Watson.
[3:11:09.480 --> 3:11:14.760]  So we have yet another moral panic in the United Kingdom based off of one tragic incident
[3:11:14.760 --> 3:11:19.920]  which was the murder, the abduction and the murder of this 33 year old woman, the initial
[3:11:19.920 --> 3:11:25.960]  debate after she was abducted and it turned out sadly killed was that women should be
[3:11:25.960 --> 3:11:33.080]  able to walk the streets of major dangerous cities late at night without being stalked,
[3:11:33.080 --> 3:11:37.920]  without being harassed, without being abducted, without being murdered and yes, obviously
[3:11:37.920 --> 3:11:43.680]  that's the case, of course anyone should be able to walk the streets late at night without
[3:11:43.680 --> 3:11:45.320]  that happening to him.
[3:11:45.320 --> 3:11:49.600]  The fact is we don't live in a utopia, we don't live in the utopia created in the minds
[3:11:49.600 --> 3:11:54.320]  of leftists where they think the biggest threat to them, the biggest threat to their personal
[3:11:54.320 --> 3:12:01.040]  safety is mean words on the internet where they literally say that words are now violence
[3:12:01.040 --> 3:12:05.720]  that opposing their arguments, that having a different opinion and bringing it to them
[3:12:05.720 --> 3:12:10.640]  in a forthright way is a form of harassment which is the victimhood narrative that feminists
[3:12:10.640 --> 3:12:13.600]  now universally embrace.
[3:12:13.600 --> 3:12:19.600]  In their minds they've created that utopia, the fact is in the real world it works very
[3:12:19.600 --> 3:12:20.600]  differently.
[3:12:20.600 --> 3:12:28.200]  I've made a number of videos now about not just young women but couples, men and women,
[3:12:28.200 --> 3:12:33.280]  who go abroad, who have this utopian vision of how the world should work in their heads,
[3:12:33.280 --> 3:12:37.680]  they think the biggest threat to their personal safety is mean words on the internet or the
[3:12:37.680 --> 3:12:42.880]  rise of fascism and Donald Trump and then they actually go to dangerous areas of the
[3:12:42.880 --> 3:12:49.520]  world and tragically in many cases women are raped, women are killed, they travel alone,
[3:12:49.520 --> 3:12:54.200]  they literally read left wing blogs on the internet saying it's safe for women to travel
[3:12:54.200 --> 3:13:01.240]  alone in for example hinterland remote areas of mountainous Morocco, that's happened
[3:13:01.240 --> 3:13:06.680]  with the two Scandinavian hikers and of course tragically they're raped, they're beheaded
[3:13:06.680 --> 3:13:11.680]  by literal ISIS terrorists and then you look back into their social media history which
[3:13:11.680 --> 3:13:18.400]  I did and people can try and frame this as gloating or trying to push your political
[3:13:18.400 --> 3:13:23.320]  agenda based off of tragedy of somebody being raped and murdered, no we're literally trying
[3:13:23.320 --> 3:13:28.560]  to prevent that happening by simply pointing out that the world is a dangerous place which
[3:13:28.560 --> 3:13:34.320]  is the title of the video I made a few days ago and that people should be wary and have
[3:13:34.320 --> 3:13:39.240]  dangerous situational awareness about their surroundings, in fact there have been several
[3:13:39.240 --> 3:13:44.160]  academic studies conducted which I talked about in some of these videos where conservatives
[3:13:44.160 --> 3:13:51.000]  have a way more heightened sense of situational danger awareness than leftists and liberals
[3:13:51.000 --> 3:13:57.360]  because leftists and liberals again have been brainwashed that cultural relativism exist
[3:13:57.360 --> 3:14:04.920]  and that all cultures are equal, no if you go to a tourist area of Venice, if you go
[3:14:04.920 --> 3:14:12.200]  to a beach in Florida that's very different from hiking through remote regions of Morocco
[3:14:12.200 --> 3:14:19.760]  where literal ISIS terrorists exist and prosper and in fact there was a famous couple that
[3:14:19.760 --> 3:14:24.840]  went cycling in Tajikistan and in fact the New York Times did a profile piece about
[3:14:24.840 --> 3:14:31.360]  them that ended up being again literally moaned down on the street and killed by ISIS members
[3:14:31.360 --> 3:14:36.280]  then we looked back at their blogs and they were traveling across the world, they were
[3:14:36.280 --> 3:14:42.520]  traveling through all these dangerous untrammeled uncharted territories for a couple of vegan
[3:14:42.520 --> 3:14:48.240]  liberals from San Francisco on their bikes and if you read their blogs they were absolutely
[3:14:48.240 --> 3:14:54.880]  shocked that people were being mean to them and that people weren't as welcoming as they
[3:14:54.880 --> 3:15:00.760]  were taught by the leftist mantra that tells them all cultures are equal and that they
[3:15:00.760 --> 3:15:05.600]  will be respected so long as they respect other people, doesn't work like that in the
[3:15:05.600 --> 3:15:10.600]  real world and this is the focal point, this is the nub of the situation we have with this
[3:15:10.600 --> 3:15:16.280]  debate in London in the UK right now to the point where a lot of these special interest
[3:15:16.280 --> 3:15:21.920]  groups have hijacked the genuine concerns of women feeling unsafe on the streets and
[3:15:21.920 --> 3:15:28.560]  let's be honest it is a genuine concern, it does happen, attractive women get harassed,
[3:15:28.560 --> 3:15:35.320]  get stalked, get followed home on the streets of major cities in the western world.
[3:15:35.320 --> 3:15:39.280]  Now that happens across the border but you will notice that this kind of outrage that
[3:15:39.280 --> 3:15:45.920]  we've seen after this tragic death of 33 year old Sarah Everard was completely absent in
[3:15:45.920 --> 3:15:52.280]  the United Kingdom when we had massive grooming gang scandals where for example in one town
[3:15:52.280 --> 3:15:59.400]  alone in Rotherham near Sheffield where I used to live 1400 girls were abducted and
[3:15:59.400 --> 3:16:05.640]  sold into sex slavery and the local council, the local police force refused to properly
[3:16:05.640 --> 3:16:10.760]  investigate it because they feared they would be called racist because the people doing
[3:16:10.760 --> 3:16:18.360]  the grooming were almost entirely Muslim men, you saw no hashtags, you saw no vigils, you
[3:16:18.360 --> 3:16:23.680]  saw no petitions to the government, you saw no people lying down playing dead in the middle
[3:16:23.680 --> 3:16:29.960]  of Parliament Square after those grooming scandals came out, not just in Rotherham
[3:16:29.960 --> 3:16:37.320]  by the way, Rochdale, Telford, Huddersfield, Oxford, literally two dozen different towns
[3:16:37.320 --> 3:16:43.400]  the exact same process took place and there were even some horror stories about fathers
[3:16:43.400 --> 3:16:48.240]  who had found out that their young daughters had been trapped, had been sold into sex slavery
[3:16:48.240 --> 3:16:53.640]  literally showing up at the houses of these groomers, these Muslim men and then the police
[3:16:53.640 --> 3:17:00.880]  turned up and arrested the fathers, there was absolutely in comparison to this zero outrage
[3:17:00.880 --> 3:17:06.600]  despite the fact that in total thousands of young girls were sold trafficked into sex
[3:17:06.600 --> 3:17:14.880]  slavery abused their lives ruined forever, yet we get one murder by somebody who is part
[3:17:14.880 --> 3:17:19.960]  of the Metropolitan Police and because he's white that gives them free reign to exploit
[3:17:19.960 --> 3:17:27.360]  it for all their other agendas, which again is not to say that women don't get stalked,
[3:17:27.360 --> 3:17:33.480]  followed, harassed, cat called on the street, basically every semi-attractive female that
[3:17:33.480 --> 3:17:38.040]  I've ever spoken to has told me the same thing, they get followed, they get harassed and that
[3:17:38.040 --> 3:17:43.560]  kind of behaviour is completely unacceptable, but there's a difference between a builder
[3:17:43.560 --> 3:17:49.400]  wolf whistling a woman and somebody abducting, kidnapping and murdering a woman that needs
[3:17:49.400 --> 3:17:54.800]  to be a line drawn between those two kind of behaviours, not that one is acceptable,
[3:17:54.800 --> 3:17:59.800]  but there's a difference, there's a nuance there, but these activists really don't understand
[3:17:59.800 --> 3:18:05.000]  what the word nuance means, so now we have these bills in parliament and now we have
[3:18:05.000 --> 3:18:09.560]  this plan by the government where they're literally going to, and this has already been
[3:18:09.560 --> 3:18:13.360]  green lighted by the way, it's not even up for discussion because it was a knee jerk
[3:18:13.360 --> 3:18:18.960]  reaction where they're going to put undercover police officers in bars and clubs in the UK
[3:18:18.960 --> 3:18:25.040]  to watch people's behaviour and to listen to their conversations and to try and figure
[3:18:25.040 --> 3:18:31.600]  out in a kind of pre-crime minority report sense if they're likely to be predatory individuals
[3:18:31.600 --> 3:18:38.560]  and if they're likely to harass women. Meanwhile, literally nobody is calling to give women
[3:18:38.560 --> 3:18:44.800]  the power to defend themselves against predators, they're trying to pass a hate crime law which
[3:18:44.800 --> 3:18:49.840]  makes misogyny a hate crime, which of course they're going to apply to the internet, they're
[3:18:49.840 --> 3:18:56.000]  going to apply to free speech, news flash, rapists and murderers who literally abduct
[3:18:56.000 --> 3:19:01.840]  and kill women off the streets of major cities, don't give a damn if you pass a hate speech
[3:19:01.840 --> 3:19:07.000]  law saying that they can't be mean to a woman on the internet and yet that's the upshot
[3:19:07.000 --> 3:19:14.280]  of this, they're talking about more CCTV surveillance covering the streets and again, zero campaigning
[3:19:14.280 --> 3:19:20.880]  on behalf of these feminists as to actually giving women the power to defend themselves.
[3:19:20.880 --> 3:19:25.840]  A woman caught carrying pepper spray, anyone caught carrying pepper spray in the UK, despite
[3:19:25.840 --> 3:19:29.440]  the fact that they may have a very good reason for doing so if they feel they're in danger,
[3:19:29.440 --> 3:19:35.880]  they will get hit with the same legal penalties that they would get hit for carrying a shotgun
[3:19:35.880 --> 3:19:48.560]  in the United Kingdom, because criminals don't care about those that carry any guns in their
[3:19:48.560 --> 3:19:49.560]  life, we'll be back.
[3:19:49.560 --> 3:19:50.560]  Summit.
[3:19:50.560 --> 3:19:51.560]  Don't News, don't go away.
[3:19:51.560 --> 3:19:52.560]  You know, listeners call into the show and they thank me and it makes me feel pathetic
[3:19:52.560 --> 3:19:57.160]  because I sit there and I beg you for support, constantly, for prayer, for financial support,
[3:19:57.160 --> 3:20:02.360]  and for word of mouth and we're all in this together and it gets old having to come to
[3:20:02.360 --> 3:20:06.080]  me and say, hey, I got great products, please bomb or we won't be here on air, but it's
[3:20:06.080 --> 3:20:09.320]  true, we're the only media organization in the United States that promotes liberty at
[3:20:09.320 --> 3:20:13.800]  this level that is not beholden to the big corporate sponsors and they've harassed and
[3:20:13.800 --> 3:20:17.520]  almost shut down everybody else, they crippled all the other groups and we're still here
[3:20:17.520 --> 3:20:22.240]  and as this whole new world order comes out and we open, our credibility is going up,
[3:20:22.240 --> 3:20:25.880]  that's why we've got to be taken off air, that's why America has got to be taken down,
[3:20:25.880 --> 3:20:30.560]  you can't have all these other nations enslaved and America is still quasi free, you can't
[3:20:30.560 --> 3:20:34.440]  have info wars has been proven right being on air with all the craziness that's about
[3:20:34.440 --> 3:20:38.840]  to unfold because if you think stuff's bad now, just get ready, so thank you all and
[3:20:38.840 --> 3:20:43.640]  get an infowarstore.com, get some great 2020 election shirts, supplements and so much more,
[3:20:43.640 --> 3:20:47.320]  they're wonderful products and they support the info war, thank you.
[3:20:47.320 --> 3:20:54.280]  As negative as times are right now and as depressing as things can be, you have to understand
[3:20:54.280 --> 3:21:01.600]  that this is all a test, this experience, this life on this planet is a reckoning.
[3:21:01.600 --> 3:21:06.880]  It's God giving us a chance to work things out with third dimension so we can decide
[3:21:06.880 --> 3:21:11.160]  where we want to spend eternity and what level we want to go to and it really does come
[3:21:11.160 --> 3:21:15.800]  down to that, so as sad as things are and as evil as things are, look at all the good
[3:21:15.800 --> 3:21:20.640]  in the world as well and realize that God is the author of our consciousness, God is
[3:21:20.640 --> 3:21:27.040]  the author of us having our own will, God is the author of us having free will and that
[3:21:27.040 --> 3:21:32.080]  free will is a beautiful thing and when you look at mainstream media in Hollywood and
[3:21:32.080 --> 3:21:37.960]  this whole evil culture in Washington D.C. and Fauci and the mass cult, it's all about
[3:21:37.960 --> 3:21:41.440]  dominating your free will, it's all about telling you you're dirty, you're ugly, you're
[3:21:41.440 --> 3:21:45.680]  in the bad because Satan hates you because you're made in the image of God, the creator
[3:21:45.680 --> 3:21:46.680]  of the universe.
[3:21:46.680 --> 3:21:53.200]  I sell supplements for two reasons, because they work, they're real, they're powerful
[3:21:53.200 --> 3:21:58.160]  and because it's a giant market, but again, why is there a giant market?
[3:21:58.160 --> 3:22:03.120]  Because it works, that's why it exponentially grows, so whether it's saw palm meadow and
[3:22:03.120 --> 3:22:11.220]  other key ingredients in our prostate formula, prostate guard, or whether it is the super
[3:22:11.220 --> 3:22:17.560]  high grade organic vitamin B12 and ultra 12, or whether it's the PQQ or the CoQ10 in DNA
[3:22:17.560 --> 3:22:24.760]  force or the pure deep breath crystal iodine and X2, these are all the very best supplements
[3:22:24.760 --> 3:22:30.400]  you're going to find in already great market of high quality products out there and it
[3:22:30.400 --> 3:22:31.920]  funds the info war.
[3:22:31.920 --> 3:22:35.280]  So even if these products weren't high quality, which they are, you're fun in the info war
[3:22:35.280 --> 3:22:40.760]  so you can't lose, info wars delivers in space, please visit infowarstore.com and get the
[3:22:40.760 --> 3:22:46.680]  products today and again, I want to thank you all for keeping us on air at infowarstore.com.
[3:22:46.680 --> 3:22:51.360]  You know, it's crazy to get to this point, it's very bittersweet, everything we've talked
[3:22:51.360 --> 3:22:55.040]  about has happened just like we said it would and now we have a lot of credibility, but
[3:22:55.040 --> 3:22:58.760]  I don't care about that, I care about beating the new world order and it's because we have
[3:22:58.760 --> 3:23:03.120]  so much credibility, they can't allow us to stay on air much longer and I don't have
[3:23:03.120 --> 3:23:06.480]  time to tell you all the stuff they're doing to us for a lot of reasons, I can't tell
[3:23:06.480 --> 3:23:10.480]  you what's going on, but let's just say this, we're going to see this through the end, we're
[3:23:10.480 --> 3:23:13.160]  going to stay on air as long as we can.
[3:23:13.160 --> 3:23:17.760]  So please pray for us and please buy the products and infowarstore.com, they're great products
[3:23:17.760 --> 3:23:19.400]  plus they fund the operation.
[3:23:19.400 --> 3:23:22.240]  So you know, unlike other products you can buy, they're still great.
[3:23:22.240 --> 3:23:23.240]  Do they fund freedom?
[3:23:23.240 --> 3:23:24.600]  No, a lot of them don't.
[3:23:24.600 --> 3:23:29.240]  These are great products that fund freedom and fund justice when the whole world's waking
[3:23:29.240 --> 3:23:31.080]  up and looking for truth.
[3:23:31.080 --> 3:23:34.480]  That's why the globalists are censoring, they can't bring in all this tyranny and leave
[3:23:34.480 --> 3:23:36.120]  people like us from the air.
[3:23:36.120 --> 3:23:40.040]  So while you're at it, don't just financially support us and spread the word, download everything
[3:23:40.040 --> 3:23:43.560]  we've done, you can find and save it because who knows how long we're going to be on the
[3:23:43.560 --> 3:23:49.560]  air and the enemy is trying to destroy everything we ever said.
[3:23:49.560 --> 3:24:10.280]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:24:10.280 --> 3:24:14.920]  The other aspect of this story that I've been talking about with this hysterical moral
[3:24:14.920 --> 3:24:20.680]  panic after the tragic murder of this woman is of course the fact that we've had anti-lockdown
[3:24:20.680 --> 3:24:25.800]  protesters in London and indeed across the United Kingdom getting thrown to the ground,
[3:24:25.800 --> 3:24:31.800]  getting whacked with batons, getting arrested and thrown in prison, getting hit with 10,000
[3:24:31.800 --> 3:24:38.160]  pound fines for almost a past year and nobody gave a damn.
[3:24:38.160 --> 3:24:43.160]  It was only when these feminists, and by the way I support their right to protest, it was
[3:24:43.160 --> 3:24:48.560]  only when these feminists got arrested, in a couple of cases got thrown to the ground,
[3:24:48.560 --> 3:24:52.160]  got manhandled, did this blow up in the media.
[3:24:52.160 --> 3:24:57.520]  We had an entire summer of Black Lives Matter protesters running rough shot through London,
[3:24:57.520 --> 3:25:04.720]  doing whatever the hell they wanted to, attacking police officers, desecrating war memorials.
[3:25:04.720 --> 3:25:10.320]  Nobody gave a damn about COVID, nobody gave a damn about social distancing, nobody gave
[3:25:10.320 --> 3:25:13.960]  a damn about, oh, these are super spreader events.
[3:25:13.960 --> 3:25:20.880]  The only instances in which that narrative was applied was when anti-lockdown protesters
[3:25:20.880 --> 3:25:22.880]  were out on the streets of London.
[3:25:22.880 --> 3:25:29.560]  That was terrible, that was awful, they were killing granny, they were selfish, meanwhile
[3:25:29.560 --> 3:25:34.880]  the cops were literally bowing to Black Lives Matter protesters while manhandling anti-lockdown
[3:25:34.880 --> 3:25:41.640]  protesters, the moment they do it to a couple of women up on Clapham Common, then it's absolute
[3:25:41.640 --> 3:25:47.320]  bedlam and it's apocalypse and we need laws, we need starsy in pubs and restaurants and
[3:25:47.320 --> 3:25:52.560]  clubs, we need hate speech laws which ban misogyny on the internet, which at this point
[3:25:52.560 --> 3:25:58.840]  misogyny basically means disagreeing with a woman on Twitter, they claim it's harassment.
[3:25:58.840 --> 3:26:04.040]  So this only exploded after this one incident and after these special interest groups got
[3:26:04.040 --> 3:26:09.840]  their claws into these feminist protests in response to the tragic death of this woman.
[3:26:09.840 --> 3:26:16.240]  By the way, they were chanting ACAB, they were chanting No Justice, No Peace, Classic
[3:26:16.240 --> 3:26:21.520]  Black Lives Matter slogans, in fact many of them had Black Lives Matter placards at a
[3:26:21.520 --> 3:26:24.280]  protest for the protection of women.
[3:26:24.280 --> 3:26:27.400]  What has that got to do with Black Lives Matter?
[3:26:27.400 --> 3:26:33.720]  It's been hijacked once again, yet we went an entire year of anti-lockdown protesters
[3:26:33.720 --> 3:26:39.840]  being treated in the exact same way that these female protesters were treated up on Clapham
[3:26:39.840 --> 3:26:45.920]  Common, nobody gave a damn, there was no moral panic, there was no mass media coverage, they
[3:26:45.920 --> 3:26:50.760]  deserved it because they were killing Granny, or but these people because they have a different
[3:26:50.760 --> 3:26:55.440]  opinion and a certain cause, well then it's fine.
[3:26:55.440 --> 3:26:59.440]  Complete double standard again because it's different special interest groups involved,
[3:26:59.440 --> 3:27:03.840]  in fact Nigel Farage gave his commentary on that, we're going to go to that now, I'll
[3:27:03.840 --> 3:27:08.480]  come back and finish up with this story, but here is Nigel Farage on the tragic death of
[3:27:08.480 --> 3:27:13.560]  this individual and the moral panic that followed, let's go to the clip.
[3:27:13.560 --> 3:27:18.040]  We're all rightly shocked and saddened by the abduction and murder of young Sarah Everard,
[3:27:18.040 --> 3:27:19.040]  we really are.
[3:27:19.040 --> 3:27:22.520]  I'm particularly surprised I think that the person that has been, we mustn't prejudge
[3:27:22.520 --> 3:27:27.440]  this, but the person that has been arrested and charged is actually a member of one of
[3:27:27.440 --> 3:27:35.760]  the elite groups from the Metropolitan Police and it has touched a chord, note Kate turning
[3:27:35.760 --> 3:27:41.840]  up quietly, discreetly at Clapham Common yesterday and laying a couple of bunches of daffodils,
[3:27:41.840 --> 3:27:49.560]  what a contrast she is as a duchess to the other duchess that spoke to us last Sunday.
[3:27:49.560 --> 3:27:55.120]  But we're not just talking about abduction and murder, we're now beginning to talk more
[3:27:55.120 --> 3:28:01.720]  broadly about women being safe on the streets and in particular about the behaviour and
[3:28:01.720 --> 3:28:09.640]  attitudes of men and that is why we saw the vigil taking place on Clapham Common and the
[3:28:09.640 --> 3:28:14.280]  big round now is about the way in which it was policed several arrests and the police
[3:28:14.280 --> 3:28:19.720]  appearing to get quite heavy hands, indeed Salih Khan demanding an inquiry, the Home
[3:28:19.720 --> 3:28:24.280]  Secretary, Pretty Patel demanding an inquiry as to how this was policed.
[3:28:24.280 --> 3:28:29.440]  Now I do understand that because this is the very same police force who took the knee last
[3:28:29.440 --> 3:28:35.840]  year to BLM protesters who went on to desecrate some of our national monuments, so there doesn't
[3:28:35.840 --> 3:28:42.840]  appear to be an inconsistency here, but there's a parallel with the BLM uprising last year
[3:28:42.840 --> 3:28:48.240]  following the murder, the death of George Floyd and it's one that I think we need to
[3:28:48.240 --> 3:28:56.840]  talk about, following that BLM uprising, we've now had month after month of white people
[3:28:56.840 --> 3:29:03.040]  being told they are guilty, those of us that are white, we have white privilege and some
[3:29:03.040 --> 3:29:08.760]  of this nonsense is being taught in our schools, it isn't healing, any racial divides, all
[3:29:08.760 --> 3:29:14.480]  it's actually doing is dividing black and white people and hugely counterproductive
[3:29:14.480 --> 3:29:20.880]  women, there is a danger that in the debate about this abduction and murder and more broadly
[3:29:20.880 --> 3:29:26.720]  how safe women are on the streets, all of which is a valid debate, there's a danger
[3:29:26.720 --> 3:29:33.600]  we go way too far in our criticism of men and broaden this out from bad people to men
[3:29:33.600 --> 3:29:39.680]  as a group, just see this from Baroness Jenny Jones in the House of Lords.
[3:29:39.680 --> 3:29:45.160]  I would argue that at the next opportunity for any bill that's appropriate I might actually
[3:29:45.160 --> 3:29:51.280]  put in an amendment to create a curfew for men on the streets after 6pm which I feel
[3:29:51.280 --> 3:29:57.080]  would make women a lot safer and discrimination of all kinds would be lessened.
[3:29:57.080 --> 3:30:03.320]  Now, was she being altogether serious, was she being provocative, why you might ask are
[3:30:03.320 --> 3:30:07.000]  people like this even in the House of Lords at all, so perhaps we don't take that too
[3:30:07.000 --> 3:30:14.040]  seriously but what about this, the first Minister of Wales, Mark Drapeford being pressed by
[3:30:14.040 --> 3:30:20.920]  the BBC or whether he could contemplate in Wales putting that curfew in place for all
[3:30:20.920 --> 3:30:23.040]  men, here he is.
[3:30:23.040 --> 3:30:28.520]  Some people have said sometimes that there should be a curfew on men for a period of
[3:30:28.520 --> 3:30:35.280]  time, is that something that you would consider?
[3:30:35.280 --> 3:30:39.720]  It wouldn't be on the top of the list of things that we would consider because it would be
[3:30:39.720 --> 3:30:44.960]  at the very best, a temporary intervention now if there were crisis circumstances.
[3:30:44.960 --> 3:30:49.280]  I'm sorry to be clear, you say it's not the top of your list, I can only take it from
[3:30:49.280 --> 3:30:58.080]  that that you could not rule out that being a potentially something that you would do.
[3:30:58.080 --> 3:31:04.800]  If there were a crisis and you needed to take dramatic action that allowed that crisis to
[3:31:04.800 --> 3:31:09.680]  be drawn down, then of course you would be prepared to consider all measures that would
[3:31:09.680 --> 3:31:10.680]  make a difference.
[3:31:10.680 --> 3:31:15.720]  Yes, that's right, the first Minister of Wales, if there was a crisis, if there was
[3:31:15.720 --> 3:31:21.280]  a scare, something akin to the Yorkshire Ripper 40 years ago or perhaps the Itwitch murderer
[3:31:21.280 --> 3:31:26.600]  who was on the run just a few years back, he would be prepared to bring it to place
[3:31:26.600 --> 3:31:32.080]  a curfew for all men, Siddiq Khan the Mayor of London now telling us that men need to
[3:31:32.080 --> 3:31:40.000]  be educated better and that misogyny must become a crime so I can feel another hate crime,
[3:31:40.000 --> 3:31:45.200]  speech crime, thought crime perhaps coming down the track.
[3:31:45.200 --> 3:31:54.040]  And all of this is in danger of alienating men and saying that men as a group are dangerous.
[3:31:54.040 --> 3:32:00.160]  That's rather like saying teenagers are dangerous because they might be carrying a knife, they
[3:32:00.160 --> 3:32:06.400]  might stab you or saying Muslims are dangerous because they're all going to be jihadi terrorists.
[3:32:06.400 --> 3:32:11.320]  When it's not true in the case of teenagers, it's not true in the case of Muslims and it
[3:32:11.320 --> 3:32:15.680]  certainly isn't true in the case of all men.
[3:32:15.680 --> 3:32:21.760]  Yes, there are some who behave terribly, we need to get a sense of perspective on this
[3:32:21.760 --> 3:32:26.960]  before we start rushing to legislation and teaching kids at school that it's wrong to
[3:32:26.960 --> 3:32:31.600]  be male because that, I fear, is where this debate is beginning to go.
[3:32:31.600 --> 3:32:36.560]  There are some bringing the voice of balance and reason to it, this is what Dewey McCall
[3:32:36.560 --> 3:32:40.520]  had to say and that's right and that's sensible.
[3:32:40.520 --> 3:32:48.880]  We must not allow the tragic abduction and murder of this young woman to turn into something
[3:32:48.880 --> 3:32:58.560]  that would be to demonise men, we've just gone too far with all of this woke nonsense.
[3:32:58.560 --> 3:33:03.440]  There's Nigel Farage with his commentary on this issue and of course the main point of
[3:33:03.440 --> 3:33:08.720]  this is that people have suddenly just realised apparently in the UK that we've lost the
[3:33:08.720 --> 3:33:14.720]  right to protest and yet many of the same people, the same leftists who support BLM,
[3:33:14.720 --> 3:33:19.400]  who support Extinction Rebellion for example, were the same people who vehemently, if you
[3:33:19.400 --> 3:33:24.880]  look at the polls, supported this lockdown and still vehemently support it to this day
[3:33:24.880 --> 3:33:31.480]  even though at the very start of that legislatively that was the excuse they used to ban protest.
[3:33:31.480 --> 3:33:37.480]  But now when they're actually enforcing it against protest that they endorse, only now
[3:33:37.480 --> 3:33:41.360]  is it a problem, an incredible double standard.
[3:33:41.360 --> 3:33:45.840]  We'll be right back, summit.news, final segment coming up, I'll go away.
[3:33:45.840 --> 3:33:50.880]  We here at Info Wars are proud to announce the first ever Kava Kava root supplement that
[3:33:50.880 --> 3:33:56.680]  is now available at InfoWarsStore.com Kava is one of the hottest new breakthroughs in
[3:33:56.680 --> 3:34:00.720]  the natural health world today, though it has been used for hundreds of years in the
[3:34:00.720 --> 3:34:05.080]  Pacific Islands for its relaxation and euphoric effects.
[3:34:05.080 --> 3:34:10.520]  According to ancient Samoan legend, Kava was given as a gift by the sun god Tagaloa,
[3:34:10.520 --> 3:34:14.880]  who they considered to be the supreme ruler and creator of the universe.
[3:34:14.880 --> 3:34:19.560]  The Samoan people would drink Kava tea during social gatherings and sacred ceremonies to
[3:34:19.560 --> 3:34:20.800]  loosen up a little.
[3:34:20.800 --> 3:34:25.640]  Nowadays Kava is used around the world by many who enjoy its serious benefits.
[3:34:25.640 --> 3:34:31.640]  The new Kava Chill by Dr. Jones Naturals contains a full blend of not only Kava Kava but other
[3:34:31.640 --> 3:34:38.360]  herbs including but not limited to, German Kama Mill, organic Skolkapp and Balarian root.
[3:34:38.360 --> 3:34:45.360]  We do expect to sell this new product quickly, so be sure to secure yours by visiting InfoWarsStore.com
[3:35:09.360 --> 3:35:11.480]  That's why they say carbon is bad.
[3:35:11.480 --> 3:35:15.200]  They are rewriting the entire genetic code of the planet.
[3:35:15.200 --> 3:35:17.080]  They are playing God.
[3:35:17.080 --> 3:35:23.840]  They believe they have been inspired by interdimensional entities that are giving them advanced technology
[3:35:23.840 --> 3:35:26.840]  to carry out this transformation.
[3:35:26.840 --> 3:35:31.240]  I know this sounds insane, but if you read the writings of the globalist it's all on
[3:35:31.240 --> 3:35:32.240]  record.
[3:35:32.240 --> 3:35:34.720]  You have been warned.
[3:35:34.720 --> 3:35:39.240]  You have been given the information to say no to this plan.
[3:35:39.240 --> 3:35:42.880]  This is the end of all life on Earth as we know it.
[3:35:42.880 --> 3:35:47.080]  This is the alien takeover of Earth.
[3:35:47.080 --> 3:35:50.560]  You cannot hide a grand assault.
[3:35:50.560 --> 3:35:55.960]  America is about to have its energy cut off, its borders destroyed, its dollar brought
[3:35:55.960 --> 3:35:57.640]  down to nothing.
[3:35:57.640 --> 3:36:01.920]  All of you that have served Satan believe that you are the right team.
[3:36:01.920 --> 3:36:05.640]  You are about to find out how pathetic you are.
[3:36:05.640 --> 3:36:12.880]  So I ask all of you who are awake and who love God, stop living in fear.
[3:36:12.880 --> 3:36:15.680]  The enemy is about to expose itself.
[3:36:15.680 --> 3:36:18.000]  The enemy can't help itself.
[3:36:18.000 --> 3:36:22.040]  The enemy comes to kill, steal and destroy.
[3:36:22.040 --> 3:36:27.680]  We sit here as good people get upset about that and try to stop it, we should, but once
[3:36:27.680 --> 3:36:33.240]  it comes through, once it hits us, once it's dominating us and raping us and attacking
[3:36:33.240 --> 3:36:37.560]  us, we just have to point out we tried to stop it.
[3:36:37.560 --> 3:36:39.720]  So prepare yourselves, America.
[3:36:39.720 --> 3:36:43.360]  You're going under the judge but just like all the children that were aborted.
[3:36:43.360 --> 3:36:45.040]  This is the truth.
[3:36:45.040 --> 3:37:08.640]  This is the InfoWare, InfoWars.com, NewsWars.com, Band.video and hundreds of other URLs we've
[3:37:08.640 --> 3:37:10.840]  launched have been banned.
[3:37:10.840 --> 3:37:18.400]  That's why every month we launch a new URL before they ban it, but Soros and Bill Gates
[3:37:18.400 --> 3:37:27.320]  and the Globlists are on our tail, but the new website is the Resistance.video, the Resistance.video.
[3:37:27.320 --> 3:37:31.720]  They're trying to block us because the truth is powerful and can't defeat them.
[3:37:31.720 --> 3:37:36.960]  So the new URL that links right to Band.video and all of our videos and all of our documentaries
[3:37:36.960 --> 3:37:42.240]  and all the special reports and all the suppressed information is at theresistance.video.
[3:37:42.240 --> 3:37:50.560]  Share the link, theresistance.video, theresistance.video.
[3:37:50.560 --> 3:38:09.960]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:38:09.960 --> 3:38:24.240]  You see this stunning irony of Blackness vehemently supporting these very lockdown policies which
[3:38:24.240 --> 3:38:25.240]  entrenched power within governments and censorship of criticism of lockdown, criticism of the
[3:38:25.240 --> 3:38:29.720]  vaccine, which entrenched power within giant transnational corporations, suddenly realizing
[3:38:29.720 --> 3:38:32.680]  that that has a negative knock on effect.
[3:38:32.680 --> 3:38:37.720]  They've suddenly realized that they've lost the right to protest and that's why we saw
[3:38:37.720 --> 3:38:43.520]  the scenes on Clapham Common just a couple of nights ago with these feminists being manhandled
[3:38:43.520 --> 3:38:46.800]  and they're pretending as if that's a new thing that's just suddenly appeared.
[3:38:46.800 --> 3:38:49.880]  Now you supported that from the very beginning.
[3:38:49.880 --> 3:38:55.360]  The conservative government in the UK passed those laws where they literally banned the
[3:38:55.360 --> 3:39:01.680]  right to protest in the name of stopping super spreader events, in the name of social distancing,
[3:39:01.680 --> 3:39:05.080]  in the name of preventing the spread of the pandemic.
[3:39:05.080 --> 3:39:10.880]  You have a Labour Party, a so-called Liberal Opposition Party in the United Kingdom that
[3:39:10.880 --> 3:39:17.160]  again has vehemently supported and even called for more draconian censorship, more draconian
[3:39:17.160 --> 3:39:22.640]  banning of protests and then you look at the polls in the UK and it's 80 plus percent
[3:39:22.640 --> 3:39:27.920]  of people predominantly leftists who supported that from the start, but now suddenly they're
[3:39:27.920 --> 3:39:33.560]  shocked that their protests are being banned, but only if their protests are being banned
[3:39:33.560 --> 3:39:39.280]  does it become a problem when they literally signed on from it from the very beginning.
[3:39:39.280 --> 3:39:44.160]  This is now expressing itself in terms of censorship with art.
[3:39:44.160 --> 3:39:51.080]  We now have Spotify and the headline is Spotify now censoring song lyrics that contain misinformation,
[3:39:51.080 --> 3:39:57.120]  literally deleting tracks by major artists from their platform that criticise lockdown,
[3:39:57.120 --> 3:40:02.240]  that question the vaccine and in this case it's Ian Brown who is probably one of the
[3:40:02.240 --> 3:40:08.840]  biggest frontmen in the United Kingdom throughout the 80s and the 90s with the Stone Roses,
[3:40:08.840 --> 3:40:11.840]  now of course with his solo career.
[3:40:11.840 --> 3:40:16.480]  In a flashback to how art that offended the Soviet regime was blacklisted, streaming giant
[3:40:16.480 --> 3:40:23.720]  Spotify is now censoring song lyrics that contain quote misinformation, what is misinformation?
[3:40:23.720 --> 3:40:29.200]  Anything that offends the technocratic elites, the scientific dictatorship.
[3:40:29.200 --> 3:40:34.720]  Ian Brown revealed that Spotify deleted his anti-lockdown song, Little See Big Tree, which
[3:40:34.720 --> 3:40:37.600]  was originally released last September.
[3:40:37.600 --> 3:40:42.560]  He tweeted a couple of days ago quote, Spotify streamed the streams and sends the artists
[3:40:42.560 --> 3:40:48.840]  like they have with my last song, took it down, just put it down the memory hole, pre-expression
[3:40:48.840 --> 3:40:49.840]  as revolution.
[3:40:49.840 --> 3:40:55.480]  And if you read the song lyrics to this track, he's basically talking about lockdowns, he's
[3:40:55.480 --> 3:41:00.680]  talking about mandatory vaccines and again, Brown has been a vehement voice against lockdown
[3:41:00.680 --> 3:41:05.680]  and mandatory vaccines since basically the start, since a year ago when it first came
[3:41:05.680 --> 3:41:06.680]  into effect.
[3:41:06.680 --> 3:41:12.000]  In fact, he said numerous times that he will refuse to perform at music venues that mandate
[3:41:12.000 --> 3:41:17.920]  proof of COVID-19 vaccination as a condition of entry.
[3:41:17.920 --> 3:41:24.680]  And that started off with him trending on Twitter and being bashed by many of these same people
[3:41:24.680 --> 3:41:28.440]  who are now suddenly so shocked that they've lost the right to protest.
[3:41:28.440 --> 3:41:34.520]  Many of them criticized Ian Brown for his anti-lockdown stance.
[3:41:34.520 --> 3:41:38.840]  And if I Spotify put out a statement after they deleted his track, they said Spotify
[3:41:38.840 --> 3:41:42.480]  prohibits content on the platform, which promotes dangerous, false, deceptive or misleading
[3:41:42.480 --> 3:41:45.120]  content about COVID-19.
[3:41:45.120 --> 3:41:53.200]  So they're literally banning art, which contradicts the narrative of the technocratic elite.
[3:41:53.200 --> 3:41:58.440]  It's not just political opinions, it's not just their narrow definition of hate speech,
[3:41:58.440 --> 3:42:03.960]  which is basically criticism of anyone who they can identify as a minority group.
[3:42:03.960 --> 3:42:07.520]  Now it's literally art, it's literally music.
[3:42:07.520 --> 3:42:10.040]  Now if you go back in history, we've seen this before.
[3:42:10.040 --> 3:42:15.480]  And as I write in the article, it's a continuation of enforcing a monoculture of thoughts by
[3:42:15.480 --> 3:42:21.600]  ensuring any form of art that carries a message which offends technocratic elites is blacklisted.
[3:42:21.600 --> 3:42:27.560]  Because if you go back to the Soviet Empire, under old Uncle Joe, art wasn't allowed to
[3:42:27.560 --> 3:42:32.760]  be publicly displayed, it wasn't allowed to be state-funded, unless it carried the same
[3:42:32.760 --> 3:42:37.680]  political message as the Soviet regime, as the Soviet elite.
[3:42:37.680 --> 3:42:40.520]  It was called socialist realism.
[3:42:40.520 --> 3:42:44.560]  It was the prescribed style of idealized art.
[3:42:44.560 --> 3:42:48.320]  This meant that every sculpture, statue and painting had to conform to an established
[3:42:48.320 --> 3:42:53.880]  aesthetic in order to quote educate citizens on how to be the perfect Soviets.
[3:42:53.880 --> 3:42:58.120]  In order to entrench loyalty to the Communist Party and advance the utopian image of Soviet
[3:42:58.120 --> 3:43:05.040]  society, the purpose of socialist realism was to limit popular culture to a specific
[3:43:05.040 --> 3:43:10.040]  highly regulated faction of emotional expression that promoted Soviet ideals.
[3:43:10.040 --> 3:43:17.040]  So again, it's about only incentivizing art, music that can be created that can even become
[3:43:17.040 --> 3:43:24.320]  public and accessible to the general public by carrying a woke, diverse social justice
[3:43:24.320 --> 3:43:25.320]  message.
[3:43:25.320 --> 3:43:30.840]  And as an artist, people know that if it doesn't have a kind of tokenism that gives a nod
[3:43:30.840 --> 3:43:36.400]  to that, even if it's not genuinely men, it's never going to get exposed to the public.
[3:43:36.400 --> 3:43:42.440]  And as an artist, as a musician, they're going to fail because they're not towing the party
[3:43:42.440 --> 3:43:43.440]  line.
[3:43:43.440 --> 3:43:49.680]  And literally the party line back in Soviet days, now it's the party line of the hashtag
[3:43:49.680 --> 3:43:53.720]  diversity woke technocratic elite.
[3:43:53.720 --> 3:43:58.960]  And in fact, I wrote an article, I think it was last year, in fact, it's here, headline
[3:43:58.960 --> 3:44:04.360]  new purity test tool to scan Hollywood scripts for diversity bias.
[3:44:04.360 --> 3:44:08.720]  Major Hollywood studios are set to use a new tool that scans movie and TV scripts and flags
[3:44:08.720 --> 3:44:14.720]  up any examples where diversity is not portrayed positively in a chilling new development that
[3:44:14.720 --> 3:44:17.800]  has echoes of Soviet realism.
[3:44:17.800 --> 3:44:23.720]  So again, we saw, for example, with the Brits, they came out publicly and said, oh, the Brit
[3:44:23.720 --> 3:44:31.640]  nominations British Film Awards is majority non white, it's majority ethnic minority.
[3:44:31.640 --> 3:44:37.840]  Even though the population of the United Kingdom at last count was 86% white.
[3:44:37.840 --> 3:44:44.120]  So if you truly wanted a meritocratic, equality driven representation of artists in the form
[3:44:44.120 --> 3:44:49.800]  of those nominations, they wouldn't be majority bane, they wouldn't be ethnic minority.
[3:44:49.800 --> 3:44:51.600]  This isn't equality.
[3:44:51.600 --> 3:44:55.200]  This is racist discrimination.
[3:44:55.200 --> 3:44:58.880]  But again, this is why these artists never speak out in the first place.
[3:44:58.880 --> 3:45:05.120]  This is why these artists, these musicians, these film directors, these actors and actresses
[3:45:05.120 --> 3:45:12.720]  can't even remain neutral on a political subject without being chased by the pitchfork
[3:45:12.720 --> 3:45:16.240]  mob, the woke, canceled culture mob.
[3:45:16.240 --> 3:45:19.080]  So they've done it for Hollywood scripts.
[3:45:19.080 --> 3:45:20.240]  They've done it for art.
[3:45:20.240 --> 3:45:23.840]  You're not going to get your art in an art gallery now unless it has some kind of tokenist
[3:45:23.840 --> 3:45:28.360]  not to political correctness, diversity, social justice.
[3:45:28.360 --> 3:45:35.080]  And now Spotify is doing it with song titles and now literally deleting songs which offend
[3:45:35.080 --> 3:45:40.360]  the sensitivities of the technocratic elite when it comes to the vaccine program and when
[3:45:40.360 --> 3:45:45.080]  it comes to social distancing when it comes to COVID-19 lockdowns.
[3:45:45.080 --> 3:45:49.440]  And on that subject, we have another headline here.
[3:45:49.440 --> 3:45:54.600]  Professor Warn's post-corona society is a national obedience contest.
[3:45:54.600 --> 3:45:59.920]  This is a Norwegian psychology professor called Charlotte Reed who warns that our post-corona
[3:45:59.920 --> 3:46:04.280]  society has turned into a national obedience contest that will have a devastating effect
[3:46:04.280 --> 3:46:06.520]  on mental health for years to come.
[3:46:06.520 --> 3:46:09.800]  You know, everyone's really concerned about mental health.
[3:46:09.800 --> 3:46:15.600]  We've seen this phenomenon over the past five, six years where people say, oh, there's
[3:46:15.600 --> 3:46:18.600]  such a big stigma around mental health.
[3:46:18.600 --> 3:46:23.120]  The reason why it's getting worse is because we're not talking about it.
[3:46:23.120 --> 3:46:27.400]  And then it seems the more we talk about it, the worse it gets.
[3:46:27.400 --> 3:46:31.840]  And that's why you get many people who go to university and they want to identify as
[3:46:31.840 --> 3:46:36.280]  being mentally ill because they think it makes them unique.
[3:46:36.280 --> 3:46:41.080]  When in fact, if you look at stoicism, if you look at the classic example of the British
[3:46:41.080 --> 3:46:46.840]  stiff upper lip, we live in a society that is now emotionally incontinent where we're
[3:46:46.840 --> 3:46:54.080]  supposed to be vulnerable, harassed under constant attack for having our opinions challenged.
[3:46:54.080 --> 3:46:58.320]  To the point now where, for example, in Q Gardens, and this is another headline, Q
[3:46:58.320 --> 3:47:04.040]  Gardens to tell visitors how racist its plants are, yeah, this is an actual story, this is
[3:47:04.040 --> 3:47:08.720]  not the onion, Q Gardens in London is to change labels on its plants and flowers in order
[3:47:08.720 --> 3:47:11.840]  to inform visitors on how racist they are.
[3:47:11.840 --> 3:47:18.000]  So now we're so precious, we're so ashamed of our culture, of our heritage that they're
[3:47:18.000 --> 3:47:23.480]  now telling people that sugar canes were a result of slavery and that we now have to
[3:47:23.480 --> 3:47:28.960]  label this, we now have to genuflect, we now have to bow our heads in shame, all these
[3:47:28.960 --> 3:47:35.160]  plants are going to be labeled as racist, despite the fact that the Brits were literally
[3:47:35.160 --> 3:47:38.920]  the first people in the modern world to ban slavery.
[3:47:38.920 --> 3:47:43.040]  Slavery still exists in numerous countries across the world, throughout India, throughout
[3:47:43.040 --> 3:47:48.520]  the Middle East, many of those countries, in fact, the vast majority are non-white countries.
[3:47:48.520 --> 3:47:51.520]  That's the problem in terms of modern day slavery, but no.
[3:47:51.520 --> 3:47:57.880]  The solution apparently is to label sugar cane plants racist, that's really going to
[3:47:57.880 --> 3:47:59.880]  solve it.
[3:47:59.880 --> 3:48:05.360]  The good news is that the actual culture that's being pushed in replacement of actual authentic
[3:48:05.360 --> 3:48:10.080]  culture like Ian Brown and his anti-lockdown song which has now been banned on Spotify
[3:48:10.080 --> 3:48:15.360]  is being rejected in greater and greater numbers, headline out of information liberation, Grammy
[3:48:15.360 --> 3:48:22.280]  ratings hit record low, viewership crashes over 50% from last year, you have Cardi B
[3:48:22.280 --> 3:48:27.400]  and all these other degenerate artists training young girls to twerk, training them to become
[3:48:27.400 --> 3:48:33.280]  basically prostitutes, that's being rejected, but Ian Brown's song which is anti-lockdown
[3:48:33.280 --> 3:48:46.600]  that has to be deleted, that's going to wrap it up, summit.news.
