[00:00.000 --> 00:02.000]  You've got it
[00:07.400 --> 00:09.400]  Waging war on corruption
[00:09.400 --> 00:38.400]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the Info War
[00:38.400 --> 00:44.400]  All right, we've got another extremely important broadcast lined up for you today
[00:50.400 --> 00:55.400]  And we are going to be here for the next two hours
[00:55.400 --> 01:08.400]  It is, of course, Sunday, the 12th day of February 2012
[01:08.400 --> 01:16.400]  And yes, I'll get into Whitney Houston dead, and it looks like it's from prescription drugs
[01:16.400 --> 01:18.400]  And we'll go over some of the numbers
[01:18.400 --> 01:22.400]  Prescription drugs, of course, kill a lot more people than illegal drugs do
[01:22.400 --> 01:27.400]  Different numbers out there, but it dwarfs them by more than 10 to 1 conservatively
[01:27.400 --> 01:30.400]  Prescription drugs are one of the most dangerous things out there
[01:30.400 --> 01:37.400]  And not just the ones that supposedly get you high, like opiates and some of the speed drugs out there
[01:37.400 --> 01:39.400]  Like Adderall and Ridland
[01:39.400 --> 01:52.400]  No, it's just regular prescription drug interactions and even over-the-counter prescription drug interactions that we are talking about
[01:52.400 --> 01:56.400]  And so we're going to be breaking all of that down today
[01:56.400 --> 02:01.400]  Also, if you've wondered why they fired people like Glenn Beck at Fox News
[02:01.400 --> 02:12.400]  And why they have gotten rid of FreedomWatch and why you see people like the Chipmunk
[02:12.400 --> 02:21.400]  Who's got a weekend show coming out and endorsing Obama and saying he's a Christian and a man of the Lord
[02:21.400 --> 02:23.400]  And then Obama's a great guy
[02:23.400 --> 02:33.400]  It's because Rupert Murdoch is clearly being blackmailed by the criminal gun-running drug dealing, money laundering, justice department
[02:33.400 --> 02:39.400]  And there's now been a bunch more arrests made in England and there's open talk of Rupert Murdoch being arrested
[02:39.400 --> 02:45.400]  His son being arrested who runs a news corps over in the UK and a lot more
[02:45.400 --> 02:49.400]  Of course, Mike Huckabee, I call him the Chipmunk
[02:49.400 --> 02:58.400]  I guess that's kind of my nickname for him, kind of like my nickname for Janet Napolitano is Mr. Napolitano or Janet Dung beetle Napolitano
[02:58.400 --> 03:02.400]  So I shouldn't just address her as the Dung beetle, some people won't know what I'm talking about
[03:02.400 --> 03:08.400]  The fake conservative Chipmunk, they're the pacified libertarians and conservatives and Christians
[03:08.400 --> 03:11.400]  Huckabee, of course, is saying how great Obama is
[03:11.400 --> 03:15.400]  You're going to see a lot more of that, you're going to hear a lot more of that
[03:15.400 --> 03:19.400]  Because it's all a mutual blackmail society
[03:19.400 --> 03:23.400]  And yeah, a news corps is basically a private intelligence gathering operation
[03:23.400 --> 03:25.400]  Always has been
[03:25.400 --> 03:32.400]  And now British arrest ate an inquiry about Murdoch tabloid paying off police
[03:32.400 --> 03:37.400]  Which is a standard procedure for dirt and wiretaps and things
[03:37.400 --> 03:41.400]  Who do you think puts wiretaps on your house for the tabloids?
[03:41.400 --> 03:45.400]  Chinese jet pilot from the moon or the Kibler elves
[03:45.400 --> 03:50.400]  Continuing here, a son journalist arrested as bribe probe widens
[03:50.400 --> 03:53.400]  A Rupert Murdoch's own Wall Street Journal reports
[03:53.400 --> 03:56.400]  And now Murdoch's on a plane over there right now
[03:56.400 --> 04:01.400]  News corps faces renewed threat of prosecution in U.S. following son threats
[04:01.400 --> 04:05.400]  And so that's why Fox News didn't cover in Fast and Furious
[04:05.400 --> 04:10.400]  And all that white Peruvian flake the Justice Department's been caught shipping in
[04:10.400 --> 04:13.400]  The federal courts, they've declared national security
[04:13.400 --> 04:18.400]  That's all hiding in plain view, Chicago Tribune, El Paso times, other papers have reported it
[04:18.400 --> 04:22.400]  Murder for hire, eight federal agencies bringing drugs in
[04:22.400 --> 04:26.400]  Shipping guns all over the U.S. not just to Mexico but also Honduras
[04:26.400 --> 04:31.400]  So it's just different branches of mafia fighting with each other
[04:31.400 --> 04:35.400]  We've got all of that coming up for you today as well
[04:35.400 --> 04:42.400]  And we have an amazing guest on Agenda 21 that I'll tell you about after this quick break
[04:42.400 --> 04:44.400]  We'll be right back, stay with us
[04:58.400 --> 05:03.400]  A little over a year ago, I began to do a lot of research into why
[05:03.400 --> 05:06.400]  Even if I had a pretty good sized meal that I was still starving
[05:06.400 --> 05:11.400]  And my research led me to a well-known fact that most of the soils that we grow our crops on
[05:11.400 --> 05:14.400]  Here in the United States and across the industrialized world
[05:14.400 --> 05:19.400]  Are almost completely depleted of almost all of the key minerals and trace elements
[05:19.400 --> 05:24.400]  That our bodies need to rebuild themselves, fight off cancer and be healthy
[05:24.400 --> 05:28.400]  I then searched out the best vitamin and mineral company out there
[05:28.400 --> 05:30.400]  And discovered Young Jevity
[05:30.400 --> 05:34.400]  The Young Jevity products are designed to give you the real nutrition you need
[05:34.400 --> 05:38.400]  And once you've got that, you don't have to eat as much to be satisfied
[05:38.400 --> 05:44.400]  I've lost 37 pounds in two months, simply getting the vitamins and minerals I need
[05:44.400 --> 05:46.400]  Check it out for yourself, it's incredible
[05:46.400 --> 05:50.400]  Go to InfowarsTeam.com today and order your first canister
[05:50.400 --> 05:56.400]  Of Beyond Tangy Tangerine Complete Multivitamin Mineral Complex Dietary Supplement
[05:56.400 --> 06:00.400]  At InfowarsTeam.com
[06:26.400 --> 06:30.400]  Transmitting Worldwide, it's Alex Jones
[06:32.400 --> 06:35.400]  Alright, every broadcast is important
[06:35.400 --> 06:38.400]  The weekday show from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. central
[06:38.400 --> 06:43.400]  The Sunday transmission from 4 to 6 central, they're all important
[06:43.400 --> 06:48.400]  But I had read some of this lady's articles over the years
[06:48.400 --> 06:51.400]  And found them to be very spot on
[06:51.400 --> 06:56.400]  The spectrum understanding of how the global corporations have set up
[06:56.400 --> 07:00.400]  The United Nations to bring in a global fascist dictatorship
[07:00.400 --> 07:03.400]  And they pose as if they're liberal and trendy
[07:03.400 --> 07:06.400]  Conservatives act like they're against the UN
[07:06.400 --> 07:09.400]  And are always saying get us out of the UN
[07:09.400 --> 07:13.400]  But it was actually the Pentagon, it was actually the U.S. government
[07:13.400 --> 07:18.400]  That set up the United Nations in 1945
[07:18.400 --> 07:22.400]  So it's special corporate interests that have already taken over America
[07:22.400 --> 07:27.400]  And are taking over the world, they've set up the UN to be that new global government
[07:27.400 --> 07:30.400]  And Ban Ki-moon, the head of the UN of course a week ago
[07:30.400 --> 07:33.400]  Was all over the news called for global government and a global tax
[07:33.400 --> 07:37.400]  And a global court and a global army, it's already all in place
[07:37.400 --> 07:42.400]  Ruth Bader Ginsburg and four other justices in one week all made announcements
[07:42.400 --> 07:45.400]  She's a former justice, but four current justices
[07:45.400 --> 07:48.400]  All came out and said get rid of the Constitution
[07:48.400 --> 07:51.400]  The New York Times came out and badmouthed it and said get rid of it
[07:51.400 --> 07:56.400]  Time Magazine, Newsweek, USA Today, CNN, ABC News
[07:56.400 --> 08:00.400]  All in the last two weeks said ditch it
[08:00.400 --> 08:03.400]  I mean I was walking by newsstands and just saw it all over the place
[08:03.400 --> 08:05.400]  When I was at Barnes and Noble a week ago
[08:05.400 --> 08:10.400]  Went home, searched engines, dumped the Constitution, get rid of the Constitution
[08:10.400 --> 08:16.400]  And there were hundreds of articles, that was the globalist PR release
[08:16.400 --> 08:21.400]  You can see, they're paid talking heads, you can see the talking points
[08:21.400 --> 08:23.400]  And it's come out, there are major talking points
[08:23.400 --> 08:28.400]  They got talking points that returning veterans are going to start staging terror attacks
[08:28.400 --> 08:30.400]  And that returning veterans are the main enemy
[08:30.400 --> 08:35.400]  I told you that back when it was secret and we got documents from FBI, federal marshals
[08:35.400 --> 08:37.400]  And state police across the country
[08:37.400 --> 08:42.400]  Three years ago, governments said well that's internal, you shouldn't have it
[08:42.400 --> 08:43.400]  But admitted it was real
[08:43.400 --> 08:48.400]  Now they're doing the rollout that domestic groups are going to stage terror attacks
[08:48.400 --> 08:54.400]  That means they're getting ready to pull the trigger and carry out the staged events to be blamed on us
[08:54.400 --> 08:59.400]  Again, the PR rollout is everything you need to know
[08:59.400 --> 09:05.400]  In the PR rollout, it's always targeting dumbed down, unconscious people that buy whatever they're told
[09:05.400 --> 09:08.400]  If you're awake, it's ridiculous, it's like riding on the wall
[09:08.400 --> 09:10.400]  It's like a bullhorn siren
[09:10.400 --> 09:16.400]  It's like completely crystal clear for someone who's even half awake
[09:16.400 --> 09:24.400]  But remember, they're targeting 60 to 70% of the public that's still in a dream-like state
[09:24.400 --> 09:28.400]  Just believing whatever they're told, thinking the government loves them and wants to kiss them on the head at night
[09:28.400 --> 09:33.400]  Who don't know the government's been hijacked by a kleptocracy
[09:33.400 --> 09:41.400]  Side issue, the point is, is that Rosa Corey is going to be joining us coming up
[09:41.400 --> 09:44.400]  She's executive director of the Post-Sustainability Institute
[09:44.400 --> 09:49.400]  She's a forensic commercial real estate appraiser, specializing in imminent domain
[09:49.400 --> 09:53.400]  And that's how in the last decade she discovered it's all UN Agenda 21
[09:53.400 --> 09:57.400]  Austin, Texas openly admits they're under Agenda 21
[09:57.400 --> 10:02.400]  They're openly putting up little UN signs at the hike and bike trail entrances now
[10:02.400 --> 10:06.400]  I didn't even know this, I hadn't been to hike and bike trail in a couple years
[10:06.400 --> 10:12.400]  Because I always go to just the side of the highway and enter hike and bike trails wherever I feel like it
[10:12.400 --> 10:16.400]  But I actually went to one a few months ago and used a regular entrance
[10:16.400 --> 10:21.400]  And there were all these UN groups, signs up, basically stating it's their territory
[10:21.400 --> 10:27.400]  They've got UN biospheres, they're under the new system, going to be tearing up existing roads
[10:27.400 --> 10:34.400]  Shutting off the highway exits to rural areas, it's already begun
[10:34.400 --> 10:38.400]  The NAFTA superhighways, the trans-Texas corridor, imminent domain
[10:38.400 --> 10:44.400]  It is a total takeover of our society, ties in to the North American Union
[10:44.400 --> 10:48.400]  It's in all the security-prosperity partnership documents
[10:48.400 --> 10:56.400]  The New York Times, of course, came out demonizing people earlier in the week
[10:56.400 --> 11:03.400]  Who talk about Agenda 21 and they admit that, oh my gosh, the public's waking up to the UN Agenda 21
[11:03.400 --> 11:09.400]  But they're conspiracy theorists because they don't want the UN system running their local towns and cities
[11:09.400 --> 11:15.400]  They don't deny it's taking over, they just say, you're a conspiracy theorist for not liking the UN
[11:15.400 --> 11:18.400]  Taking over your local government through regionalism
[11:18.400 --> 11:22.400]  And it's designed to shut down the family farms, drive everybody into the cities
[11:22.400 --> 11:26.400]  It's official UN maps that have been out for more than 15 years
[11:26.400 --> 11:31.400]  That show more than half the United States off limits to human activity
[11:31.400 --> 11:40.400]  We're going to be breaking all of that down today in the second hour with our guests
[11:40.400 --> 11:46.400]  In fact, she joins us after the 45 break when we come back at 45 after she's going to be joining us
[11:46.400 --> 11:55.400]  Because I've read some of her work and it knew that she was spot on as she's written a book behind the green mask
[11:55.400 --> 12:04.400]  The whole fake green movement's about land grabbing, power grabbing, nothing to do with sensible environmental laws and things
[12:04.400 --> 12:14.400]  It's all a neo-futalistic excuse for centralized mega-corporations that control governments to take control of our society
[12:14.400 --> 12:19.400]  And when you read the New York Times article again, they don't deny it's happening
[12:19.400 --> 12:25.400]  They just say, oh my gosh, these people are starting to fight us at the local level and turn this back
[12:25.400 --> 12:30.400]  It's terrible, I mean the UN's great and this is for the earth
[12:30.400 --> 12:36.400]  But hearing her on the radio, see I've read some of her articles
[12:36.400 --> 12:42.400]  But hearing her on the radio the other day, I heard her on a local Austin station
[12:42.400 --> 12:48.400]  I was driving home and listened to her for about 30 minutes and then I sat there in the parking lot at my house
[12:48.400 --> 12:53.400]  Even though I wanted to go in and see my family for about 30 minutes listening to her just riveted
[12:53.400 --> 12:58.400]  Because I'd never heard anyone tie it all together
[12:58.400 --> 13:04.400]  I'd separately done all the research, I knew everything she was saying was true and accurate
[13:04.400 --> 13:14.400]  But I'd never heard anybody really put it all together just how hellish this is, this covert creeping takeover through the zoning boards
[13:14.400 --> 13:19.400]  The state zoning boards, the highway departments, seizing the entire infrastructure
[13:19.400 --> 13:25.400]  And then here I live in Austin, the worst city east of California
[13:25.400 --> 13:29.400]  California has fully fallen to this, total feudalism
[13:29.400 --> 13:36.400]  Only plus percent yearly carbon taxes, home inspections, they're saying no future single family dwellings
[13:36.400 --> 13:43.400]  Germany now has passed this as law, I'm not kidding, look it up, Derspiegel says how great it is
[13:43.400 --> 13:54.400]  Carbon taxes, carbon rationing, the only city to totally be implementing this at a more disgusting level is Austin
[13:54.400 --> 14:06.400]  And they just come in and openly get in everyone's face and say under Agenda 21
[14:06.400 --> 14:14.400]  And there it is from the United Nations website, you type in Agenda21UN.org and you'll be on their site as they admit global government, global tax
[14:14.400 --> 14:23.400]  But then separately they have the ADL Southern Poverty Law Center and others coming out and saying we're cooks, we're crazy, we're nuts
[14:23.400 --> 14:26.400]  It doesn't exist
[14:26.400 --> 14:36.400]  Understand that, it's all happening, world government being announced run by six megabanks that created 1,500 plus trillion in fraudulent paper
[14:36.400 --> 14:42.400]  Bought up the world through fraud, now they're imploding it to consolidate control and buy up everything on pennies at the dollar
[14:42.400 --> 14:48.400]  And having us bail out their system with hundreds of trillions of dollars to prop it up
[14:48.400 --> 14:55.400]  While lecturing us that we've got to have our taxes raised and our standard of living dropped to pay off our debts
[14:55.400 --> 15:07.400]  All planned, all official, and they have all these traitorous organizations here in the United States that pose as the arbiters of all information
[15:07.400 --> 15:15.400]  Calling those of us that read the official UN plans and see it being implemented, we are the enemy
[15:15.400 --> 15:20.400]  And part of UNESCO and the UN program is the federalization of police worldwide
[15:20.400 --> 15:23.400]  Because once they're under federal control they can be internationalized
[15:23.400 --> 15:27.400]  And they have all the major police departments doing joint training with foreign police departments
[15:27.400 --> 15:34.400]  And being able to go and arrest people in Japan and then Japanese police can come to Austin and arrest people here
[15:34.400 --> 15:37.400]  So we're going to have her on coming up
[15:37.400 --> 15:47.400]  We've got Ron Pohl news first, then news on of course Whitney Houston dead from prescription drugs, much more deadly than even illegal drugs
[15:47.400 --> 15:54.400]  We've got Rupert Murdoch, Mayface criminal charges, we've got just a massive blitz of news straight ahead
[15:54.400 --> 16:18.400]  Our websites are infowars.com and we're streaming video at prismplanet.tv

[16:56.400 --> 16:59.400]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com
[17:00.400 --> 17:07.400]  You've heard Alex explaining how the silver lungs generator infuses the respiratory system with your self produced colloidal silver solutions
[17:07.400 --> 17:15.400]  Yet many are unaware of the entire function of the silver lung system and how it has been designed to deliver your silver solutions anywhere in or on the body
[17:15.400 --> 17:20.400]  My name is Mario Safaldi and I'm the developer of the Silver Lungs Generator

[18:59.400 --> 19:03.400]  I had tried everything, I had cut back the amount of food I was eating
[19:03.400 --> 19:06.400]  I was lifting weights and jogging, but nothing was working
[19:06.400 --> 19:11.400]  My body was literally starving for minerals and trace elements as well as key vitamins
[19:11.400 --> 19:18.400]  And as soon as I had that, I immediately could eat half of what I was eating previously and be satisfied
[19:18.400 --> 19:23.400]  Now there are hundreds of great products at infowarseteam.com but I want to point out the three
[19:23.400 --> 19:29.400]  That have helped me lose 37 pounds in just two months
[19:29.400 --> 19:34.400]  Products like Beyond Tangy Tangerine, Holland Burst and Rebound
[19:34.400 --> 19:37.400]  When I started taking the Tangy Tangerine and other products every day
[19:37.400 --> 19:40.400]  I lost more than 37 pounds in just two months
[19:40.400 --> 19:46.400]  Now that's results, I want to challenge my listeners to go to infowarseteam.com
[19:46.400 --> 19:54.400]  And to order just three of their products and you will see the changes in the way you look, feel and in your appetite almost immediately

[20:18.400 --> 20:24.400]  This is the leading up frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order
[20:24.400 --> 20:29.400]  It's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network
[20:29.400 --> 20:35.400]  Boy, I tell you, I've got a challenge here to get to all this news before our guest joins us
[20:35.400 --> 20:38.400]  Look at these headlines
[20:38.400 --> 20:44.400]  Facing bailout or chaos, Greek parliament starts debate on austerity laws
[20:44.400 --> 20:50.400]  It's about the benefits and pay almost all the money to the very banks that created the crisis
[20:50.400 --> 20:54.400]  And who have now put all their people in charge of the government
[20:54.400 --> 21:02.400]  Because their last group of operatives over Greece and the same as in Ireland, Spain, Italy, the United States
[21:02.400 --> 21:04.400]  The last group was put in place
[21:04.400 --> 21:08.400]  All of the operatives are Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan
[21:08.400 --> 21:10.400]  There's other big banks involved in the thieving
[21:10.400 --> 21:14.400]  They're operatives all over the world when they take down New Zealand
[21:14.400 --> 21:19.400]  It's Goldman Sachs operatives that are the finance minister and or the prime minister or president
[21:19.400 --> 21:23.400]  When you see them run a scam in Chile, it's the same people
[21:23.400 --> 21:27.400]  It's always a former president of Goldman Sachs or JP Morgan
[21:27.400 --> 21:31.400]  When you see them do it in England, I mean it's a crew of scam artists
[21:31.400 --> 21:34.400]  And then you look at who's funding Agenda 21
[21:34.400 --> 21:37.400]  Same groups, it's so amazing
[21:37.400 --> 21:40.400]  And then we did find the articles during the break
[21:40.400 --> 21:45.400]  Southern Poverty Law Center and others say we're insane for not wanting a world government
[21:45.400 --> 21:48.400]  First we were cooks for saying a world government was coming
[21:48.400 --> 21:54.400]  Now they admit it's here, we're bad because we don't like the world government now
[21:54.400 --> 21:59.400]  Have you noticed that? They don't deny it's a UN program in our towns and cities
[21:59.400 --> 22:01.400]  They just say we're bad because we don't want it
[22:01.400 --> 22:04.400]  Remember the old days when the world government didn't exist?
[22:04.400 --> 22:07.400]  Remember we were crazy in the big mega banks, the international banks
[22:07.400 --> 22:09.400]  They weren't going to try to set up a world government
[22:09.400 --> 22:12.400]  No, that's what cooks talk about
[22:12.400 --> 22:16.400]  Now it's in the Associated Press world governments here
[22:16.400 --> 22:19.400]  Global carbon taxes paid to the UN
[22:19.400 --> 22:22.400]  But you're still bad, you're bad for being right
[22:22.400 --> 22:25.400]  You're bad for warning fellow Americans
[22:25.400 --> 22:28.400]  You're bad for warning your fellow Canadians
[22:28.400 --> 22:34.400]  And I guess I was bad too when I pointed out over a month ago there was clear fraud in Iowa
[22:34.400 --> 22:36.400]  On January 3rd
[22:36.400 --> 22:40.400]  And then it came out three weeks later that they said we're throwing out the results
[22:40.400 --> 22:42.400]  And just giving it to Santorum
[22:42.400 --> 22:46.400]  There was fraud and trucks missing with ballots
[22:46.400 --> 22:52.400]  Well there were no trucks, they vote at the precinct, post it and then call it in
[22:52.400 --> 22:56.400]  But we had the witnesses, we had the voting fraud experts
[22:56.400 --> 22:58.400]  There was fraud in Iowa, now admitted total fraud
[22:58.400 --> 23:01.400]  There was fraud in Florida, now being admitted total fraud
[23:01.400 --> 23:04.400]  There was fraud in South Carolina, now admitted total fraud
[23:04.400 --> 23:10.400]  There was admitted total fraud in Nevada, we wrote articles about it, exposed it
[23:10.400 --> 23:14.400]  The exit poll showed Ron Paul in first place, poll showed him in first place
[23:14.400 --> 23:16.400]  He gets third place
[23:16.400 --> 23:23.400]  Every exit poll, every major poll showed Ron Paul winning main, he doesn't win
[23:23.400 --> 23:25.400]  Same deal
[23:25.400 --> 23:30.400]  And Ron Paul has now done what he didn't do in 2008
[23:30.400 --> 23:33.400]  He's come out and said yes there's fraud
[23:33.400 --> 23:36.400]  And there is fraud, and he's got to point it out
[23:36.400 --> 23:38.400]  First they told you he couldn't win
[23:38.400 --> 23:41.400]  Then they gave him less time in the debates
[23:41.400 --> 23:46.400]  Then when they didn't give him attention they lied about him and demonized him
[23:46.400 --> 23:49.400]  This is the same media that went along with the lies about WMDs
[23:49.400 --> 23:54.400]  The same media that knows the government was caught shipping guns into Mexico to blame the Second Amendment
[23:54.400 --> 23:59.400]  And won't even talk about it now
[23:59.400 --> 24:05.400]  And now Ron Paul has come out, this is from Business Wire, it's up on infowars.com
[24:05.400 --> 24:10.400]  Ron Paul campaign comments on main caucus results
[24:10.400 --> 24:15.400]  Headline Ron Paul refuses to concede main official campaign release
[24:15.400 --> 24:23.400]  And they go on to point out that all of their data shows that they basically should have won
[24:23.400 --> 24:30.400]  You know, the big telltale was when 2% were reporting in Nevada
[24:30.400 --> 24:41.400]  The entire corporate whore, dinosaur, prostitute, sewer stream, trader media said that he was the indisputed victor
[24:41.400 --> 24:45.400]  And I'm not going to go back over Iowa, I've already done four or five shows on that
[24:45.400 --> 24:50.400]  I mean, I sat there and watched Fox News with Carl Rove and I played the clip here
[24:50.400 --> 24:54.400]  And they lost a bunch of the ballots and trucks and I started laughing
[24:54.400 --> 24:58.400]  We don't know where the precinct heads are and all these precincts had to be the university towns
[24:58.400 --> 25:03.400]  Like Ames, which in polls, Ron Paul was getting close to 60% of the vote
[25:03.400 --> 25:08.400]  Of course he ended up getting like 15% once they had the little special trucks come up missing
[25:08.400 --> 25:11.400]  But there are no trucks involved in ballots
[25:11.400 --> 25:18.400]  And just all disappeared and Carl Rove said, well, you know what, there was a gentleman's agreement between Mitt Romney and Santorum
[25:18.400 --> 25:23.400]  And they decided to give those delegates to Santorum and that's the way it is
[25:23.400 --> 25:34.400]  And the Fox host didn't ask them one time, well, who's your source? Where was this behind the closed doors meeting?
[25:34.400 --> 25:37.400]  And then people said, Alex, don't say there's fraud in Iowa
[25:37.400 --> 25:42.400]  Even though we had delegates and people calling in who witnessed it all the next day and the day after that
[25:42.400 --> 25:47.400]  The eyewitnesses, a lot of them who swore out statements later
[25:47.400 --> 25:50.400]  And then it came out, of course, three weeks after that
[25:50.400 --> 25:53.400]  Oh, yeah, it's all a fraud, we don't know what happened
[25:53.400 --> 25:56.400]  We're throwing the results out, but giving it all to Santorum now
[25:56.400 --> 26:00.400]  He just gets everything
[26:00.400 --> 26:11.400]  Well, now Ron Paul is saying that something is going on and that things aren't jiving and they break it all down
[26:11.400 --> 26:15.400]  And they are beginning to contest it and they better do it
[26:15.400 --> 26:23.400]  And I'll cover that more later if we have time to get into it
[26:23.400 --> 26:28.400]  But speaking of media manipulation, and it's not just news corps that's doing this
[26:28.400 --> 26:34.400]  News corps has been caught paying off police, they admit that goes on, they've been caught spying on people
[26:34.400 --> 26:41.400]  They've been caught doing all this stuff and I'll assure you it is not just going on in England or Europe
[26:41.400 --> 26:48.400]  But here's the New York Times, British Arrest 8 in Inquiry about Murdoch Tabloid
[26:48.400 --> 26:54.400]  And now there's talk of the Justice Department in Diting Members of News Corps here in North America
[26:54.400 --> 26:59.400]  That's the parent company of Fox News for those that don't know
[26:59.400 --> 27:06.400]  And you wonder why suddenly you're hearing Fox host in the last two months say Obama's a good Christian man
[27:06.400 --> 27:14.400]  I think it could be in others, I've talked to Fox host, I'm just going to leave it at that, multiple insiders at Fox
[27:14.400 --> 27:19.400]  I had two sources and then lost them because even though I was allowed to talk about it without saying names
[27:19.400 --> 27:27.400]  Some people got yelled at and threatened, but I have some other sources that I developed years ago that I've talked to
[27:27.400 --> 27:35.400]  And yes, they've been told, in memos you will stop bashing Barack Obama or this whole place is going down
[27:35.400 --> 27:38.400]  People have complained, they're like, well that's going to kill ratings, number one
[27:38.400 --> 27:42.400]  Not that those traders up there actually care about this country
[27:42.400 --> 27:47.400]  They want to at least be able to bash Obama, that gets the ratings and they've been told back off
[27:47.400 --> 27:52.400]  Because the Justice Department is looking at arresting Rupert Murdoch
[27:52.400 --> 27:56.400]  And if I was Murdoch, I would go ahead and release everything he's got on Obama right now
[27:56.400 --> 27:59.400]  Because let me tell you, the way this is going, they're going for broke
[27:59.400 --> 28:02.400]  You notice they got rid of Glenn Beck
[28:02.400 --> 28:07.400]  And he was told, you will stop bashing George Soros, you will stop covering all this
[28:07.400 --> 28:11.400]  And Glenn Beck to his credit said, I'm not going to do that and left Fox
[28:11.400 --> 28:19.400]  And his contract was, I mean, I've gone after Glenn Beck a lot because behind the scenes, I'm going to be a guest on Fox in New York
[28:19.400 --> 28:23.400]  And they tell us, well, Glenn Beck's throwing a fit if you come on the other show
[28:23.400 --> 28:26.400]  And he's saying they won't ever have this other host on if you do that
[28:26.400 --> 28:29.400]  And Glenn Beck's gone after my sponsors and all sorts of stuff
[28:29.400 --> 28:34.400]  But, I mean, he is a hard-nosed wolf, but he did not sell out to News Corp
[28:34.400 --> 28:41.400]  You notice Judge Napolitano, who had the second highest ratings, I actually looked him up, on Fox Business and Rising
[28:41.400 --> 28:43.400]  And was making major news, gone
[28:43.400 --> 28:48.400]  So Fox News is rolling over to George Soros and Obama
[28:48.400 --> 28:52.400]  And you know what, I think when you're done doing that, they're still going to arrest you
[28:52.400 --> 28:54.400]  I think you've made a miscalculation
[28:54.400 --> 28:59.400]  Alright, more news straight ahead on Iran, Whitney Houston, and a lot more
[29:25.400 --> 29:28.400]  Guarantee you love the way they fit
[29:29.400 --> 29:34.400]  They put a diamond gusset in the crotch, where you need it most
[29:34.400 --> 29:39.400]  Blue diamond gussets got it, others don't
[29:39.400 --> 29:43.400]  We turned jeans inside out, diamond gusset jeans
[29:43.400 --> 29:46.400]  Made in the USA with unparalleled quality
[29:46.400 --> 29:50.400]  Our Defender motorcycle jeans combine gusset comfort with Kevlar protection
[29:50.400 --> 29:52.400]  So you can ride all day with confidence
[29:52.400 --> 29:55.400]  Order yours at gusset.com
[29:55.400 --> 30:24.400]  Diamond gusset jeans got it, others don't
[30:26.400 --> 30:29.400]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents
[30:29.400 --> 30:34.400]  That give you rashes, itching sores, and deteriorating clothing called lint
[30:34.400 --> 30:37.400]  If you want something better, if you want something you've never had before
[30:37.400 --> 30:39.400]  You've had to do something you've never done before

[31:59.400 --> 32:02.400]  I've been telling you about E-Foods Direct for a while now

[32:06.400 --> 32:09.400]  Number 10, the food I get from E-Foods Direct tastes great
[32:09.400 --> 32:12.400]  Number 9, the E-Foods Meals are easy to prepare
[32:12.400 --> 32:15.400]  Eight, E-Foods Direct delivers the food right to my front door
[32:15.400 --> 32:18.400]  Seven, most of these meals cost less than two dollars
[32:18.400 --> 32:21.400]  Six, with their large variety, I can eat it every day
[32:21.400 --> 32:25.400]  Five, I always have access to high quality and delicious food
[32:25.400 --> 32:29.400]  Number four, E-Foods products don't spoil, so I never waste any food
[32:29.400 --> 32:32.400]  Three, E-Foods uses only safe, healthy ingredients
[32:32.400 --> 32:37.400]  Number two, I have my own food supply and don't depend on the grocery store
[32:37.400 --> 32:43.400]  And the number one reason I promote E-Foods Direct is they build special offers just for my listeners

[32:52.400 --> 33:14.400]  Call E-Foods Direct at 800-409-5633 or efoodsdirect.com forward slash Alex
[33:22.400 --> 33:31.400]  We should never be afraid to die, that's the great Mr. Bellamy, fan of the show, been on the show
[33:31.400 --> 33:36.400]  We love you, Muse, doing a great job out there, Liberty is popular
[33:36.400 --> 33:41.400]  And this broadcast is all about legalizing freedom
[33:41.400 --> 33:47.400]  Okay, we've already gone over, Ron Paul coming out and saying there's evidence of fraud
[33:47.400 --> 33:54.400]  And that they're going to contest Romney supposedly being the winner because all the votes aren't even counted
[33:54.400 --> 33:57.400]  And there's been evidence in other states of fraud
[33:57.400 --> 34:03.400]  I was just getting, before I get into Whitney Houston, what's happening with the Arab League
[34:03.400 --> 34:07.400]  And the big move towards a wider war in Syria and Iran
[34:07.400 --> 34:12.400]  I want to go back to what's happening with Rupert Murdoch
[34:12.400 --> 34:21.400]  The problem with having a criminal government is that they cannot be trusted to go after people for other crimes
[34:21.400 --> 34:27.400]  And then once you have a criminal government, different levels of criminals within the system
[34:27.400 --> 34:36.400]  Can't ever blow the whistle on each other because then a criminal at any level can bring down the whole House of Cards
[34:36.400 --> 34:44.400]  And then that allows the criminality to only intensify, and it's part of the corruption process
[34:44.400 --> 34:49.400]  And so from what I've seen in some of the folks pleading guilty, some of the people died
[34:49.400 --> 34:56.400]  The Star Witness was murdered in England, that was just a, or Arkansas-ed
[34:56.400 --> 35:00.400]  That this is a war between two different factions of the globalist
[35:00.400 --> 35:06.400]  And I predicted, when this really started breaking six months ago, that you'd see a big switch in Newscore
[35:06.400 --> 35:14.400]  And I've now confirmed that they've been told to lay off Obama and to lay off the Labor Party
[35:14.400 --> 35:18.400]  The Democratic Party's counterpart in England, that mafia
[35:18.400 --> 35:23.400]  Or people are going to go to jail, including Rupert Murdoch's son, bare minimum
[35:23.400 --> 35:27.400]  And perhaps even Rupert Murdoch himself
[35:27.400 --> 35:31.400]  And what's being asked today by the London Guardian and Reuters and others is
[35:31.400 --> 35:42.400]  Will the U.S. Justice Department, who is investigating Newscore, indict people at Newscore here in North America
[35:42.400 --> 35:48.400]  Now again, this is a Justice Department caught shipping guns into Mexico
[35:48.400 --> 35:53.400]  That's killed police and Border Patrol and over 2,000 Mexican citizens
[35:53.400 --> 35:57.400]  Justice Department admits that, and CBS News told you what we knew would be there
[35:57.400 --> 36:01.400]  They got the memos, that it was to be blamed on the Second Amendment
[36:01.400 --> 36:04.400]  Now that was buried in the CBS News article, the link to the memo
[36:04.400 --> 36:09.400]  But ship guns into Mexico and ship them into Indiana, Illinois, Florida, other states
[36:09.400 --> 36:12.400]  To then call for shutting down gun shows
[36:12.400 --> 36:16.400]  I mean, these are criminals staging terror attacks against America
[36:16.400 --> 36:19.400]  Have you read the definition of terrorism?
[36:19.400 --> 36:26.400]  Threatening violence or carrying out violence so that populations or individuals accept your political demands
[36:26.400 --> 36:31.400]  You ship guns into Mexico to get a bunch of people killed so you can blame the Second Amendment
[36:31.400 --> 36:37.400]  That's terrorism, but you notice, oh, you're not hearing about Fast and Furious on Fox anymore
[36:37.400 --> 36:45.400]  And Darylissa, as I predicted, the Attorney General a few months ago said, hey, George Bush was running similar programs
[36:45.400 --> 36:49.400]  And boy, they started shutting down those hearings real fast
[36:49.400 --> 36:53.400]  And one day after said, well, it's up to Obama to do something about this
[36:53.400 --> 36:56.400]  We've caught the Attorney General lying
[36:56.400 --> 37:03.400]  How can Republicans ever bring down a Bill Clinton or a Barack Obama or other mobsters as they pardon mobsters and others?
[37:03.400 --> 37:08.400]  How can they ever do that if they themselves are up to their eyeballs in it?
[37:08.400 --> 37:13.400]  And see, this is how once corruption is tolerated, the sky's the limit
[37:13.400 --> 37:15.400]  That's why they announced two weeks ago
[37:15.400 --> 37:19.400]  That, oh, yes, there's now IOUs for all the major federal pensions
[37:19.400 --> 37:25.400]  Those have been completely raided to give to the far end too big to fail banks
[37:25.400 --> 37:28.400]  So you're not going to be getting your pension funds
[37:28.400 --> 37:31.400]  I mean, if you're 45 working for the government, you're getting nothing
[37:31.400 --> 37:34.400]  Let's say you're 63 about to retire in a couple years
[37:34.400 --> 37:39.400]  You'll get something that's going to be devalued and it's going to be reduced
[37:39.400 --> 37:44.400]  And they're already got the media saying it's not your money, it's a form of welfare
[37:44.400 --> 37:48.400]  All because you serve the system, all because you let the banksters take over
[37:48.400 --> 37:52.400]  All because when Ban Ki-moon announces world government, that's the head of the UN
[37:52.400 --> 37:59.400]  You still laugh at people like me because you were taught it was fashionable to laugh at people that talked about global government
[37:59.400 --> 38:03.400]  We're being conquered by a bunch of criminal, Bernie Madoff types, tin lay types
[38:03.400 --> 38:07.400]  And if you don't fully wake up and get angry, they're going to win
[38:07.400 --> 38:16.400]  They're going to fully bankrupt us like Nigeria or Chile or what happened to the Argentinians
[38:16.400 --> 38:19.400]  Who were just as wealthy as we were 15 years ago
[38:19.400 --> 38:22.400]  The old saying, rich is an Argentine
[38:22.400 --> 38:29.400]  So here's another one the Daily Caller reported on and then it did end up making it some other major newspapers
[38:29.400 --> 38:37.400]  The ivory compromised officials leaving dieted financial crime suspects free from prosecution under holders DOJ
[38:37.400 --> 38:46.400]  And they leaked to DOJ documents and a lot more in this lengthy article that Tucker Carlson's outfit put out
[38:46.400 --> 38:49.400]  And this was in federal documents
[38:49.400 --> 38:55.400]  I got to give Carlson, even though he has said publicly that I'm a piece of trash, credit for doing this
[38:55.400 --> 38:59.400]  Because this had not been in US news, it was in the federal documents
[38:59.400 --> 39:03.400]  And they paid off the Justice Department people, we know the names
[39:03.400 --> 39:10.400]  And it's trillions in Cayman Island bank accounts and all the major Justice Department officials are being paid
[39:10.400 --> 39:13.400]  Publicly and it's all come out and no one gets in trouble
[39:13.400 --> 39:19.400]  Kind of like it came out in February of 2011 in federal court in Chicago
[39:19.400 --> 39:27.400]  That the cartels do work for the US government and are laundering drug money and are shipping cocaine in under US authorization
[39:27.400 --> 39:33.400]  Under fast and furious with aid agencies and it's in the federal documents but it's never been a national news story
[39:33.400 --> 39:40.400]  We broke it, Paul Watson did and months after we broke it from the federal documents that listeners pointed out to us
[39:40.400 --> 39:45.400]  The Chicago Tribune and El Paso Times did report but nothing was done
[39:45.400 --> 39:48.400]  Nothing was done, let me explain something to you
[39:48.400 --> 39:56.400]  One cartel alone brought in five tons in one year directly under ATF control
[39:56.400 --> 39:59.400]  And the ATF even told them where to launder the money
[39:59.400 --> 40:01.400]  And then Bloomberg even reported on it
[40:01.400 --> 40:05.400]  Wells Fargo, Wacovia, they're all involved
[40:05.400 --> 40:11.400]  Wells Fargo, Wacovia, 376 billion alone in two years
[40:11.400 --> 40:14.400]  Oh yes, the government runs it all with the big banks
[40:14.400 --> 40:22.400]  376 billion, the crack house person, Whitney Houston isn't managing that, okay?
[40:22.400 --> 40:24.400]  Let me just explain how this works to everybody
[40:24.400 --> 40:25.400]  God bless her soul
[40:25.400 --> 40:31.400]  Crack heads running crack houses and users and poor addicts, they're not the ones doing it
[40:31.400 --> 40:33.400]  Why are the drugs illegal?
[40:33.400 --> 40:41.400]  To boost the price so there's a big market and so all the zombies go out, the drug addicts and rob you and car jack you
[40:41.400 --> 40:44.400]  And break in your house or sell their bodies
[40:44.400 --> 40:49.400]  So your daughters sell their bodies to then buy drugs from low level dealers
[40:49.400 --> 40:53.400]  And then that money goes right back to the military industrial complex
[40:53.400 --> 40:57.400]  This is all on record
[40:57.400 --> 40:59.400]  This is all on record
[40:59.400 --> 41:04.400]  And so you've got a Justice Department that's drug dealing, that's running guns to blame the Second Amendment
[41:04.400 --> 41:06.400]  You bet I'm risking my life doing this, I don't care
[41:06.400 --> 41:08.400]  Somebody's got to do it
[41:08.400 --> 41:10.400]  I'll never commit suicide though, remember that
[41:10.400 --> 41:12.400]  And there are good people in the Justice Department
[41:12.400 --> 41:15.400]  It's compartmentalized high up groups
[41:15.400 --> 41:16.400]  Why do we know about this?
[41:16.400 --> 41:25.400]  Because ATF agents in Phoenix, Arizona, Chicago, Illinois, Tampa, Florida and other areas said I'm not going to be part of this
[41:25.400 --> 41:30.400]  It's now come out that there have been fistfights at multiple ATF facilities over this
[41:30.400 --> 41:36.400]  Actual people breaking people's noses
[41:36.400 --> 41:39.400]  Supervisors have had their noses broken
[41:39.400 --> 41:45.400]  When people say, you know, you're killing people, I'm not doing this in fistfights breakout
[41:45.400 --> 41:51.400]  Okay, so it's time for the good people in the government to start going public and get past this intimidation
[41:51.400 --> 41:56.400]  I'm a private citizen, I've gone public, I put my cards face down on the table
[41:56.400 --> 42:00.400]  I'm out there with everything hanging out in front of God and country and everybody else
[42:00.400 --> 42:08.400]  My whole family, my name, everything hanging out up against the most murderous criminals the world's ever seen
[42:08.400 --> 42:15.400]  And you're like, well, why aren't you dead? Because they don't want to highlight and underline an exclamation point, everything I've said and done
[42:15.400 --> 42:17.400]  That's why
[42:17.400 --> 42:23.400]  But it doesn't mean I hadn't been threatened, doesn't mean I hadn't been physically attacked, doesn't mean there hadn't been dirty tricks you can't imagine
[42:23.400 --> 42:26.400]  And that, and I...
[42:26.400 --> 42:34.400]  Temporally, here on this planet, here in this dimension, I'm alive because they don't want to highlight everything I've done
[42:34.400 --> 42:38.400]  But in the spiritual realm, it's because God's got His hand on me, I'm in God's hand
[42:38.400 --> 42:44.400]  And if something does happen to me, it's God's will, but I have total faith, whatever it is, that's God's will
[42:44.400 --> 42:50.400]  But listen, nobody's safe, this is what collapses societies, this is how you become third world countries
[42:50.400 --> 42:59.400]  It's not standing up against evil, so the murdering criminal justice department has no right to go after news core for their petty garbage
[42:59.400 --> 43:04.400]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator
[43:04.400 --> 43:08.400]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill
[43:08.400 --> 43:14.400]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have
[43:14.400 --> 43:20.400]  It's true, total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming
[43:20.400 --> 43:24.400]  Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded
[43:24.400 --> 43:29.400]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem
[43:29.400 --> 43:32.400]  Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids
[43:32.400 --> 43:36.400]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related onages
[43:36.400 --> 43:41.400]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind
[43:41.400 --> 43:46.400]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors
[43:46.400 --> 43:52.400]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com, that's mysolarbackup.com

[44:19.400 --> 44:25.400]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver solutions
[44:25.400 --> 44:30.400]  And also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream

[46:51.400 --> 46:56.400]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item
[46:56.400 --> 46:59.400]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com
[47:01.400 --> 47:04.400]  Coast to coast, direct from Austin
[47:04.400 --> 47:09.400]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network
[47:15.400 --> 47:19.400]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center
[47:19.400 --> 47:21.400]  In the heart of the Resistance
[47:21.400 --> 47:24.400]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show
[47:29.400 --> 47:36.400]  Okay, if you ever wanted to know what Agenda 21 is, what sustainable development means
[47:36.400 --> 47:40.400]  We're going to be covering it coming up here in a few minutes
[47:40.400 --> 47:42.400]  In fact, guys, we print the USA Today
[47:42.400 --> 47:47.400]  Schwarzenegger says he'll focus on states, counties and cities for green agenda
[47:47.400 --> 47:49.400]  It's all admitted by the UN
[47:49.400 --> 47:52.400]  It's all on their own website, un.org
[47:52.400 --> 48:01.400]  That they are setting global standards for zoning, for gardens, for farming
[48:01.400 --> 48:05.400]  They say that hay dust is $5,000 fines
[48:05.400 --> 48:08.400]  You can see major NAFTA highways
[48:08.400 --> 48:11.400]  When you drive up from Texas into Oklahoma and Kansas
[48:11.400 --> 48:16.400]  Where you'll drive 100 miles and there's no exit to the rural communities that are ghost towns now
[48:16.400 --> 48:20.400]  They just block the highways and build McDonald's and things in the middle
[48:20.400 --> 48:22.400]  That's all Agenda 21
[48:22.400 --> 48:26.400]  And it's all admitted and it's so frustrating to make films like Endgame
[48:26.400 --> 48:29.400]  Blueprints for global enslavement four years ago
[48:29.400 --> 48:33.400]  It's so frustrating to read the UN documents, to see the executive orders
[48:33.400 --> 48:40.400]  To see their admitted plans in their own words for a global neo-futilistic surf system
[48:40.400 --> 48:44.400]  A post-industrial world, Maurice Strong, Ted Turner
[48:44.400 --> 48:48.400]  And then to have the New York Times with his headline, activist fight green projects
[48:48.400 --> 48:50.400]  Seeing UN plot
[48:50.400 --> 48:53.400]  And they admit, yeah, the UN is setting your local rules
[48:53.400 --> 48:56.400]  But what's wrong with that? It's for the earth
[48:56.400 --> 48:58.400]  It's not a plot
[48:58.400 --> 49:04.400]  Really, when the city council announced 20 to 80% increases in power prices in the next year
[49:04.400 --> 49:06.400]  They said it's for sustainability
[49:06.400 --> 49:08.400]  You're using too much power
[49:08.400 --> 49:10.400]  This will teach you to use less power
[49:10.400 --> 49:13.400]  And it's general electric that came in and helped shut down the other power plants
[49:13.400 --> 49:16.400]  So they can sell you less for more
[49:16.400 --> 49:21.400]  I mean, I saw a London Telegraph article where they admitted it's a global scam
[49:21.400 --> 49:26.400]  So we're waking up to the scam of insider corporations through the UN
[49:26.400 --> 49:28.400]  And through Republicans
[49:28.400 --> 49:32.400]  It was George Herbert Walker Bush gave us this
[49:32.400 --> 49:36.400]  It was all of these guys who got assigned on to the Earth Summit
[49:36.400 --> 49:37.400]  And all these rules
[49:37.400 --> 49:40.400]  And none of it has to do with the environment
[49:40.400 --> 49:44.400]  They're releasing genetically engineered mosquitoes to force inoculators
[49:44.400 --> 49:45.400]  That's in the news
[49:45.400 --> 49:48.400]  Genetically modified mosquitoes are being released in Florida
[49:48.400 --> 49:53.400]  They've got thousands of new GMO crops that in all the big studies
[49:53.400 --> 49:55.400]  Just type in crops
[49:55.400 --> 50:00.400]  GMO crops linked to organ failure, sterility and lab rats
[50:00.400 --> 50:02.400]  Look at this article
[50:02.400 --> 50:06.400]  Out of the independent GM food ban in Monsanto canteen
[50:06.400 --> 50:13.400]  The GMO scientists working at Monsanto laboratories refused to eat their own GMO
[50:13.400 --> 50:16.400]  And just type in GMO corn linked to organ failure
[50:16.400 --> 50:19.400]  This kills the honeybees that eat it
[50:19.400 --> 50:20.400]  Here's another one
[50:20.400 --> 50:23.400]  China's elite enjoys untainted fruits
[50:23.400 --> 50:27.400]  Asia Times says they're obsessed with not eating GMO
[50:27.400 --> 50:30.400]  They signed a deal in the 70s to sterilize and reduce their population
[50:30.400 --> 50:31.400]  One shall policy
[50:31.400 --> 50:32.400]  Here's another one
[50:32.400 --> 50:33.400]  London Telegraph
[50:33.400 --> 50:36.400]  Queen Elizabeth Hall, 60 years of growing vegetables
[50:36.400 --> 50:38.400]  They're obsessed with not eating GMO
[50:38.400 --> 50:41.400]  Always talking about how they want to reduce our population
[50:41.400 --> 50:42.400]  Here's another one
[50:42.400 --> 50:47.400]  Royal vegetable garden takes root
[50:47.400 --> 50:48.400]  Here's another one
[50:48.400 --> 50:50.400]  Raw milk fans are getting a raw deal
[50:50.400 --> 50:53.400]  Queen Elizabeth has only each raw milk
[50:53.400 --> 50:57.400]  But it's illegal in England and in Canada
[50:57.400 --> 51:00.400]  And other British royal Commonwealths to have raw milk
[51:00.400 --> 51:02.400]  But the royalty have it
[51:02.400 --> 51:03.400]  Here's another one
[51:03.400 --> 51:04.400]  Breaking it down
[51:04.400 --> 51:06.400]  LA Times in China
[51:06.400 --> 51:08.400]  What you eat tells who you are
[51:08.400 --> 51:10.400]  Obsessed with not taking vaccines
[51:10.400 --> 51:13.400]  Obsessed with not drinking sodium fluoride
[51:13.400 --> 51:17.400]  Chinese party officials maintain secret organic gardens
[51:17.400 --> 51:21.400]  While trying to force the population to eat the GMO Trojan horse
[51:21.400 --> 51:22.400]  Time magazine in Germany
[51:22.400 --> 51:24.400]  A better vaccine for politicians
[51:24.400 --> 51:27.400]  Comes up as a secret program that the German military
[51:27.400 --> 51:29.400]  Upper brass and German government
[51:29.400 --> 51:35.400]  All take, quote, secret vaccines that are clean
[51:35.400 --> 51:38.400]  What's the problem with labeling genetically modified GMOs?
[51:38.400 --> 51:39.400]  They're now announcing
[51:39.400 --> 51:41.400]  The head of the FDA, who's former Monsanto
[51:41.400 --> 51:43.400]  Is coming out and saying
[51:43.400 --> 51:47.400]  They're not going to let you know if something is GMO
[51:47.400 --> 51:49.400]  And saying the public doesn't trust it
[51:49.400 --> 51:51.400]  So they're not going to let you know now
[51:51.400 --> 51:56.400]  You're not going to be allowed to even label your own product
[51:56.400 --> 51:57.400]  It's not just that you have to label it
[51:57.400 --> 51:59.400]  It's that you're not allowed to label it
[51:59.400 --> 52:01.400]  That's what they're trying to do right now
[52:01.400 --> 52:03.400]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is so diabolical
[52:03.400 --> 52:05.400]  The very groups that call for reducing our populations
[52:05.400 --> 52:09.400]  Ted Turner, Prince Philip
[52:09.400 --> 52:13.400]  Just type in, you'll get Sunday Times of London ABC News
[52:13.400 --> 52:17.400]  World's elite meet and secret to discuss over population
[52:17.400 --> 52:19.400]  Three years ago
[52:19.400 --> 52:21.400]  They got caught meeting and secret at Rockefeller University
[52:21.400 --> 52:22.400]  And who was there?
[52:22.400 --> 52:25.400]  Oprah Winfrey, big population control person
[52:25.400 --> 52:27.400]  Ted Turner
[52:27.400 --> 52:29.400]  The Rockefellers
[52:29.400 --> 52:31.400]  Bill and Melinda Gates
[52:31.400 --> 52:33.400]  Big Eugenicist
[52:33.400 --> 52:35.400]  Warren Buffett
[52:35.400 --> 52:37.400]  And of course George Soros
[52:37.400 --> 52:39.400]  To discuss how global government
[52:39.400 --> 52:41.400]  That was in the article
[52:41.400 --> 52:45.400]  How global government could help reduce population
[52:45.400 --> 52:47.400]  But Bill Gates says he wants to give you shots
[52:47.400 --> 52:49.400]  Because he cares about you
[52:49.400 --> 52:51.400]  And he wants you to eat GMO
[52:51.400 --> 52:53.400]  But he's obsessed with not eating GMO
[52:53.400 --> 52:55.400]  And so is the royal family
[52:55.400 --> 52:57.400]  Look it up, they won't take the vaccines
[52:57.400 --> 52:59.400]  They won't drink the fluoride
[52:59.400 --> 53:01.400]  I've seen newscasts where it's just buried
[53:01.400 --> 53:03.400]  Oh, the queen has all her own farms and ranches
[53:03.400 --> 53:05.400]  And they have chefs that follow them around the world
[53:05.400 --> 53:07.400]  And bring their food with them
[53:07.400 --> 53:09.400]  And then you find out Ted Turner's doing it
[53:09.400 --> 53:13.400]  Now, they know there's an exodus of educated people
[53:13.400 --> 53:15.400]  To the countryside to try to grow their own food
[53:15.400 --> 53:17.400]  And get away from this
[53:17.400 --> 53:21.400]  Outside Austin in some of the towns like Wemberley
[53:21.400 --> 53:23.400]  That were covered this years ago
[53:23.400 --> 53:25.400]  Because my children are homeschooled
[53:25.400 --> 53:27.400]  And going to different homeschooling events
[53:27.400 --> 53:31.400]  It's doctors, scientists, biological weapons experts
[53:31.400 --> 53:33.400]  You name it, all living out there
[53:33.400 --> 53:35.400]  Knowing what's going on
[53:35.400 --> 53:39.400]  And you'll be at some event and they're going
[53:39.400 --> 53:41.400]  Yeah, what are you going to do about it?
[53:41.400 --> 53:43.400]  You're not going to stop it, we've all come out here
[53:43.400 --> 53:45.400]  And you find out they all know
[53:45.400 --> 53:47.400]  The educated people all know about this
[53:47.400 --> 53:49.400]  And we're going to talk to a lady
[53:49.400 --> 53:51.400]  For the full next hour
[53:51.400 --> 53:53.400]  Who discovered all of this as well and has written a book on it
[53:53.400 --> 53:55.400]  And again, I've had a lot of experts
[53:55.400 --> 53:59.400]  A lot of diplomats
[53:59.400 --> 54:03.400]  Advisors to Congress on Dr. Michael Kauffman and others
[54:03.400 --> 54:06.400]  But she's able to really tie it all together
[54:06.400 --> 54:09.400]  And give you the big picture of how it's going to affect you
[54:09.400 --> 54:12.400]  With Gena 21, a global corporate takeover
[54:12.400 --> 54:14.400]  To shut down the rural areas
[54:14.400 --> 54:16.400]  Remember what happened last year?
[54:16.400 --> 54:20.400]  The EPA was saying $5,000 fines for dust from hay
[54:20.400 --> 54:22.400]  No dust on your farm
[54:22.400 --> 54:24.400]  But Big Agra, they're exempt
[54:24.400 --> 54:26.400]  And Big Agra wrote those rules
[54:26.400 --> 54:28.400]  Animal ID, premises ID to shut you down
[54:28.400 --> 54:30.400]  What the Soviets do
[54:30.400 --> 54:32.400]  Shut down rural areas
[54:32.400 --> 54:34.400]  What does the Gena 21 do?
[54:34.400 --> 54:36.400]  Same thing that is in Memorandum 200
[54:36.400 --> 54:38.400]  State Department Memorandum 200 under Kissinger
[54:38.400 --> 54:40.400]  Use food as a weapon
[54:40.400 --> 54:42.400]  Austin just passed a law trying to harass
[54:42.400 --> 54:44.400]  And shut down people with their own chickens
[54:44.400 --> 54:46.400]  And eggs
[54:46.400 --> 54:48.400]  They're harassing Amish everywhere
[54:48.400 --> 54:50.400]  People selling pecans
[54:50.400 --> 54:52.400]  They're trying to pass laws outlawing all that
[54:52.400 --> 54:54.400]  They're trying to shut down supplements
[54:54.400 --> 54:56.400]  But a Gena 21 is about the takeover
[54:56.400 --> 54:58.400]  Where you can't build your own barn
[54:58.400 --> 55:00.400]  You can't have your own pond
[55:00.400 --> 55:02.400]  Or if there is a, quote, wetland
[55:02.400 --> 55:04.400]  Now you can't build on your own property
[55:04.400 --> 55:06.400]  Even if you've owned it for 100 years
[55:06.400 --> 55:08.400]  And what they announced in the U.S. and Europe
[55:08.400 --> 55:10.400]  Just last week
[55:10.400 --> 55:12.400]  The drones
[55:12.400 --> 55:14.400]  Being used to watch farmers
[55:14.400 --> 55:16.400]  Spy satellites watching
[55:16.400 --> 55:18.400]  Rural communities in America
[55:18.400 --> 55:20.400]  And in Europe
[55:20.400 --> 55:22.400]  This whole grid is on us
[55:22.400 --> 55:24.400]  Stalin didn't want you to raise your own food
[55:24.400 --> 55:26.400]  Now we're about to go to break, I wanted to get her on
[55:26.400 --> 55:28.400]  Just to kick off here at the start
[55:28.400 --> 55:30.400]  Right before the start
[55:30.400 --> 55:32.400]  Of the second hour
[55:32.400 --> 55:34.400]  And she's Rosa Corey
[55:34.400 --> 55:36.400]  And she is an executive director
[55:36.400 --> 55:38.400]  Of the Post Sustainability Institute
[55:38.400 --> 55:40.400]  She is a forensic commercial real estate appraiser
[55:40.400 --> 55:42.400]  Specializing in imminent domain
[55:42.400 --> 55:44.400]  Evaluation
[55:44.400 --> 55:46.400]  And she again
[55:46.400 --> 55:48.400]  Has written a book on Agenda 21
[55:48.400 --> 55:50.400]  The
[55:50.400 --> 55:52.400]  Book is excellent, we'll tell you about that as well
[55:52.400 --> 55:54.400]  Exposing Agenda 21 in sustainable development
[55:54.400 --> 55:56.400]  In the minute or two before we go to break
[55:56.400 --> 55:58.400]  Just give people a synopsis
[55:58.400 --> 56:00.400]  Of what Agenda 21 is
[56:00.400 --> 56:02.400]  And we'll come back and break down
[56:02.400 --> 56:04.400]  This global corporate takeover system
[56:04.400 --> 56:06.400]  Well, you know what?
[56:06.400 --> 56:08.400]  It's not that it's going to impact you
[56:08.400 --> 56:10.400]  It's impacting you right now
[56:10.400 --> 56:12.400]  Agenda 21
[56:12.400 --> 56:14.400]  Is a plan to inventory
[56:14.400 --> 56:16.400]  And control
[56:16.400 --> 56:18.400]  All resources, human
[56:18.400 --> 56:20.400]  And natural
[56:20.400 --> 56:22.400]  And all means of production in the world
[56:22.400 --> 56:24.400]  And this is the process that is happening
[56:24.400 --> 56:26.400]  Right now
[56:26.400 --> 56:28.400]  In every single city, town
[56:28.400 --> 56:30.400]  Community
[56:30.400 --> 56:32.400]  And the entire world
[56:32.400 --> 56:34.400]  And you're seeing it right now in the United States
[56:34.400 --> 56:36.400]  It's a global plan
[56:36.400 --> 56:38.400]  To vocal it
[56:38.400 --> 56:40.400]  We've got about a minute and a half before we go to break
[56:40.400 --> 56:42.400]  How did you get tuned into this?
[56:42.400 --> 56:44.400]  How did you discover this?
[56:44.400 --> 56:46.400]  Well, I've been doing research
[56:46.400 --> 56:48.400]  Of course I'm a forensic appraiser
[56:48.400 --> 56:50.400]  I appraise property in the
[56:50.400 --> 56:52.400]  Nine counties of the San Francisco Bay Area
[56:52.400 --> 56:54.400]  And in doing my research
[56:54.400 --> 56:56.400]  I found in researching redevelopment
[56:56.400 --> 56:58.400]  I found that it's a
[56:58.400 --> 57:00.400]  It's a funding and implementation arm
[57:00.400 --> 57:02.400]  For United Nations Agenda 21
[57:02.400 --> 57:04.400]  And in doing
[57:04.400 --> 57:06.400]  Doing this research I had to
[57:06.400 --> 57:08.400]  Be able to support everything that I
[57:08.400 --> 57:10.400]  Was coming up with
[57:10.400 --> 57:12.400]  Because I might have to at some point
[57:12.400 --> 57:14.400]  Testify regarding this information
[57:14.400 --> 57:16.400]  So everything that I've come up with
[57:16.400 --> 57:18.400]  Of course this is available to all people
[57:18.400 --> 57:20.400]  It's very available
[57:20.400 --> 57:22.400]  On the United Nations websites
[57:22.400 --> 57:24.400]  As well as many others
[57:24.400 --> 57:26.400]  This is all true and supportable
[57:26.400 --> 57:28.400]  It's not a conspiracy theory
[57:28.400 --> 57:30.400]  It's a conspiracy fact
[57:30.400 --> 57:32.400]  And it's happening right now
[57:32.400 --> 57:34.400]  There are funding boards all of it
[57:34.400 --> 57:36.400]  It is so diabolical
[57:36.400 --> 57:38.400]  I've been to the smart growth conferences
[57:38.400 --> 57:40.400]  They admit this is total feudalism
[57:40.400 --> 57:42.400]  Right here in Austin
[57:42.400 --> 57:44.400]  Giant power bill increases
[57:44.400 --> 57:46.400]  And they say it's for the earth
[57:46.400 --> 57:48.400]  Just charging you more
[57:50.400 --> 57:52.400]  I've been telling you about
[57:52.400 --> 57:54.400]  E-Foods Direct for a while now
[57:54.400 --> 57:56.400]  Here are my top 10 reasons to stock up

[01:00:04.400 --> 01:00:06.400]  Deep behind enemy lines
[01:00:06.400 --> 01:00:08.400]  The information war continues
[01:00:08.400 --> 01:00:18.400]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network

[01:00:20.400 --> 01:00:22.400]  Physically, economically
[01:00:22.400 --> 01:00:24.400]  Like Agenda 21
[01:00:24.400 --> 01:00:26.400]  It is the total takeover of society
[01:00:26.400 --> 01:00:28.400]  Home inspectors
[01:00:28.400 --> 01:00:30.400]  No more single family homes
[01:00:30.400 --> 01:00:32.400]  We've played that Plantopoulos clip
[01:00:32.400 --> 01:00:34.400]  That they show in England to school kids
[01:00:34.400 --> 01:00:36.400]  Where everything you do is going to be monitored
[01:00:36.400 --> 01:00:38.400]  You'll have to get authorization to travel
[01:00:38.400 --> 01:00:40.400]  Calority credits
[01:00:40.400 --> 01:00:42.400]  This is all official
[01:00:42.400 --> 01:00:44.400]  In fact, 20 years ago
[01:00:44.400 --> 01:00:46.400]  They called it at the Agenda 21 conference
[01:00:46.400 --> 01:00:48.400]  That's where the term comes from
[01:00:48.400 --> 01:00:50.400]  That they had
[01:00:50.400 --> 01:00:52.400]  Amore Strong called it a post industrial world
[01:00:52.400 --> 01:00:54.400]  And 20 years later
[01:00:54.400 --> 01:00:56.400]  They're about to meet again
[01:00:56.400 --> 01:00:58.400]  In Rio de Janeiro
[01:00:58.400 --> 01:01:00.400]  Now, we've got Rosa Corey
[01:01:00.400 --> 01:01:02.400]  Who's author of Behind the Green
[01:01:02.400 --> 01:01:04.400]  Mask
[01:01:04.400 --> 01:01:06.400]  She's available at Amazon.com
[01:01:06.400 --> 01:01:08.400]  I'm going to order it in bulk
[01:01:08.400 --> 01:01:10.400]  And also carry it soon at infowars.com
[01:01:10.400 --> 01:01:12.400]  But we have a link to where you can find it
[01:01:12.400 --> 01:01:14.400]  At infowars.com right now
[01:01:14.400 --> 01:01:16.400]  She has really studied it
[01:01:16.400 --> 01:01:18.400]  And again, I've got so many points
[01:01:18.400 --> 01:01:20.400]  I want to add to back her up
[01:01:20.400 --> 01:01:22.400]  But I'm going to try to shut up
[01:01:22.400 --> 01:01:24.400]  And let her roll here now
[01:01:24.400 --> 01:01:26.400]  Coming up especially in the next segment
[01:01:26.400 --> 01:01:28.400]  So she can really go into how
[01:01:28.400 --> 01:01:30.400]  It ties into everything
[01:01:30.400 --> 01:01:32.400]  But please continue
[01:01:32.400 --> 01:01:34.400]  You know, the thing is
[01:01:34.400 --> 01:01:36.400]  This is not, as I said
[01:01:36.400 --> 01:01:38.400]  It's not a conspiracy theory
[01:01:38.400 --> 01:01:40.400]  It's a conspiracy fact
[01:01:40.400 --> 01:01:42.400]  And back in 1987
[01:01:42.400 --> 01:01:44.400]  The United Nations
[01:01:44.400 --> 01:01:46.400]  The World Conference
[01:01:46.400 --> 01:01:48.400]  On the World Commission
[01:01:48.400 --> 01:01:50.400]  On Environment and Development
[01:01:50.400 --> 01:01:52.400]  Stated that
[01:01:52.400 --> 01:01:54.400]  The environment was under attack
[01:01:54.400 --> 01:01:56.400]  That the planet was being destroyed
[01:01:56.400 --> 01:01:58.400]  By human beings
[01:01:58.400 --> 01:02:00.400]  And they came up with sustainable
[01:02:00.400 --> 01:02:02.400]  This is a concept
[01:02:02.400 --> 01:02:04.400]  Now you've heard it everywhere
[01:02:04.400 --> 01:02:06.400]  You've got sustainable yogurt now
[01:02:06.400 --> 01:02:08.400]  But sustainable development
[01:02:08.400 --> 01:02:10.400]  The concept is
[01:02:10.400 --> 01:02:12.400]  That the needs of the present
[01:02:12.400 --> 01:02:14.400]  Are developed
[01:02:14.400 --> 01:02:16.400]  Without compromising future generations
[01:02:16.400 --> 01:02:18.400]  Ability to meet their own needs
[01:02:18.400 --> 01:02:20.400]  So of course then they determined
[01:02:20.400 --> 01:02:22.400]  That yes, everything we were doing now
[01:02:22.400 --> 01:02:24.400]  Was threatening the ability
[01:02:24.400 --> 01:02:26.400]  Of future generations to meet their needs
[01:02:26.400 --> 01:02:28.400]  And that commission
[01:02:28.400 --> 01:02:30.400]  Was sent out to come back
[01:02:30.400 --> 01:02:32.400]  With an action plan
[01:02:32.400 --> 01:02:34.400]  For the 21st century
[01:02:34.400 --> 01:02:36.400]  And that's what Agenda 21
[01:02:36.400 --> 01:02:38.400]  Is, that's why it's called Agenda 21
[01:02:38.400 --> 01:02:40.400]  It's the agenda for the 21st century
[01:02:40.400 --> 01:02:42.400]  And this is, as I said
[01:02:42.400 --> 01:02:44.400]  It's a plan to inventory
[01:02:44.400 --> 01:02:46.400]  And control you
[01:02:46.400 --> 01:02:48.400]  And everything that has to do
[01:02:48.400 --> 01:02:50.400]  With your life
[01:02:50.400 --> 01:02:52.400]  Everything having to do with the planet
[01:02:52.400 --> 01:02:54.400]  So it's inventorying, controlling
[01:02:54.400 --> 01:02:56.400]  All water, all land use
[01:02:56.400 --> 01:02:58.400]  We're talking about the potential
[01:02:58.400 --> 01:03:00.400]  Of losing control
[01:03:00.400 --> 01:03:02.400]  Of everything that we have
[01:03:02.400 --> 01:03:04.400]  Including our own bodies
[01:03:04.400 --> 01:03:06.400]  And what you find with Agenda 21
[01:03:06.400 --> 01:03:08.400]  Is it's divided into two elements
[01:03:08.400 --> 01:03:10.400]  Which is smart growth
[01:03:10.400 --> 01:03:12.400]  And
[01:03:12.400 --> 01:03:14.400]  The wild lands
[01:03:14.400 --> 01:03:16.400]  And what happened after, of course
[01:03:16.400 --> 01:03:18.400]  We know that it was signed on to
[01:03:18.400 --> 01:03:20.400]  Agenda 21 was signed on to
[01:03:20.400 --> 01:03:22.400]  By George H. W. Bush in 1992
[01:03:22.400 --> 01:03:24.400]  And then it was brought back
[01:03:24.400 --> 01:03:26.400]  To the United States to be
[01:03:26.400 --> 01:03:28.400]  Implemented here. Clinton
[01:03:28.400 --> 01:03:30.400]  In 1993
[01:03:30.400 --> 01:03:32.400]  Established the president's council
[01:03:32.400 --> 01:03:34.400]  On sustainable development
[01:03:34.400 --> 01:03:36.400]  And that was made up of 12
[01:03:36.400 --> 01:03:38.400]  Cabinet level secretaries
[01:03:38.400 --> 01:03:40.400]  Including defense, education,
[01:03:40.400 --> 01:03:42.400]  Agriculture, energy
[01:03:42.400 --> 01:03:44.400]  All of these
[01:03:44.400 --> 01:03:46.400]  You know, all of these
[01:03:46.400 --> 01:03:48.400]  Administrative
[01:03:48.400 --> 01:03:50.400]  Level cabinet
[01:03:50.400 --> 01:03:52.400]  Positions were all in on this
[01:03:52.400 --> 01:03:54.400]  And along with, of course
[01:03:54.400 --> 01:03:56.400]  Our captains of industry
[01:03:56.400 --> 01:03:58.400]  Like Ken Lay from Enron
[01:03:58.400 --> 01:04:00.400]  Dow Chemical
[01:04:00.400 --> 01:04:02.400]  And then you have the environmental groups
[01:04:02.400 --> 01:04:04.400]  As well as Natural Resources
[01:04:04.400 --> 01:04:06.400]  Defense Council and others
[01:04:06.400 --> 01:04:08.400]  And they all got together and they said
[01:04:08.400 --> 01:04:10.400]  How are we going to get Agenda 21
[01:04:10.400 --> 01:04:12.400]  Into every single
[01:04:12.400 --> 01:04:14.400]  Town, city, state, county
[01:04:14.400 --> 01:04:16.400]  In the entire United States
[01:04:16.400 --> 01:04:18.400]  So they decided that they wanted
[01:04:18.400 --> 01:04:20.400]  To focus on controlling land use
[01:04:20.400 --> 01:04:22.400]  And what they did was
[01:04:22.400 --> 01:04:24.400]  They gave a multi-million dollar
[01:04:24.400 --> 01:04:26.400]  Grant to the American
[01:04:26.400 --> 01:04:28.400]  Planning Association
[01:04:28.400 --> 01:04:30.400]  And they said, can you guys come up
[01:04:30.400 --> 01:04:32.400]  With a plan for us
[01:04:32.400 --> 01:04:34.400]  We can get into every planning project
[01:04:34.400 --> 01:04:36.400]  Stay right there. Let's explain how
[01:04:36.400 --> 01:04:38.400]  That's why there's global standardization
[01:04:38.400 --> 01:04:40.400]  That's why the exact same system
[01:04:40.400 --> 01:04:42.400]  Worldwide is being set up
[01:04:42.400 --> 01:04:44.400]  They admit they're doing it
[01:04:44.400 --> 01:04:46.400]  Now Homeland Security just two weeks ago
[01:04:46.400 --> 01:04:48.400]  Was it Davos and said
[01:04:48.400 --> 01:04:50.400]  It's a war for sustainability
[01:04:50.400 --> 01:04:52.400]  Incredible. We're going to break down
[01:04:52.400 --> 01:04:54.400]  How it's already affecting you
[01:04:54.400 --> 01:04:56.400]  And how it's going to affect you straight ahead
[01:04:58.400 --> 01:05:00.400]  A little over a year ago
[01:05:00.400 --> 01:05:02.400]  I began to do a lot of research
[01:05:02.400 --> 01:05:04.400]  Into why, even if I had a pretty good size
[01:05:04.400 --> 01:05:06.400]  Meal that I was still starving
[01:05:06.400 --> 01:05:08.400]  And my research led me to a well-known fact
[01:05:08.400 --> 01:05:10.400]  That most of the soils
[01:05:10.400 --> 01:05:12.400]  That we grow our crops on here in the United States
[01:05:12.400 --> 01:05:14.400]  And across the industrialized world
[01:05:14.400 --> 01:05:16.400]  Are almost completely depleted
[01:05:16.400 --> 01:05:18.400]  With almost all of the key minerals
[01:05:18.400 --> 01:05:20.400]  And trace elements that our bodies
[01:05:20.400 --> 01:05:22.400]  Need to rebuild themselves
[01:05:22.400 --> 01:05:24.400]  Fight off cancer and be healthy
[01:05:24.400 --> 01:05:26.400]  I then searched out the best
[01:05:26.400 --> 01:05:28.400]  Vitamin and mineral company out there
[01:05:28.400 --> 01:05:30.400]  And discovered Young Jevity
[01:05:30.400 --> 01:05:32.400]  The Young Jevity products are designed
[01:05:32.400 --> 01:05:34.400]  To give you the real nutrition you need
[01:05:34.400 --> 01:05:36.400]  And once you've got that
[01:05:36.400 --> 01:05:38.400]  You don't have to eat as much to be satisfied
[01:05:38.400 --> 01:05:40.400]  I've lost 37 pounds
[01:05:40.400 --> 01:05:42.400]  In two months
[01:05:42.400 --> 01:05:44.400]  Simply getting the vitamins and minerals
[01:05:44.400 --> 01:05:46.400]  That I need
[01:05:46.400 --> 01:05:48.400]  Check it out for yourself, it's incredible

[01:06:06.400 --> 01:06:08.400]  From enemies, foreign and domestic
[01:06:08.400 --> 01:06:14.400]  It's Alex Jones
[01:06:14.400 --> 01:06:16.400]  Now the Desert News
[01:06:16.400 --> 01:06:18.400]  And the Associated Press
[01:06:18.400 --> 01:06:20.400]  Last week
[01:06:20.400 --> 01:06:22.400]  Ran articles
[01:06:22.400 --> 01:06:24.400]  Head of UN, Ban Ki-moon
[01:06:24.400 --> 01:06:26.400]  Wants World Tax
[01:06:26.400 --> 01:06:28.400]  For social service programs
[01:06:28.400 --> 01:06:30.400]  But that means eugenic sterilization
[01:06:30.400 --> 01:06:32.400]  Abortion
[01:06:32.400 --> 01:06:34.400]  But there he is announcing that they want
[01:06:34.400 --> 01:06:36.400]  This World Tax
[01:06:36.400 --> 01:06:38.400]  For the present planet.TV
[01:06:38.400 --> 01:06:40.400]  Viewers of your radio listener
[01:06:40.400 --> 01:06:42.400]  Which is the majority of our audience
[01:06:42.400 --> 01:06:44.400]  That listens on XM and over 100 AM
[01:06:44.400 --> 01:06:46.400]  And FM stations
[01:06:46.400 --> 01:06:48.400]  You can simply type in UN leaders
[01:06:48.400 --> 01:06:50.400]  Consider World Tax
[01:06:50.400 --> 01:06:52.400]  Defund social protection services
[01:06:52.400 --> 01:06:54.400]  Oh well, it's for the children
[01:06:54.400 --> 01:06:56.400]  Here's another one at Infowars.com
[01:06:56.400 --> 01:06:58.400]  The direct link to the World Development
[01:06:58.400 --> 01:07:00.400]  Report funded by the World Bank
[01:07:00.400 --> 01:07:02.400]  Suggests that once they've imploded
[01:07:02.400 --> 01:07:04.400]  The economy, go read it
[01:07:04.400 --> 01:07:06.400]  Again, that to get your welfare check
[01:07:06.400 --> 01:07:08.400]  The sterilization van
[01:07:08.400 --> 01:07:10.400]  Will arrive at your home and sterilize you
[01:07:10.400 --> 01:07:12.400]  1984 World Bank Report
[01:07:12.400 --> 01:07:14.400]  Contemplates sterilization vans
[01:07:14.400 --> 01:07:16.400]  And camps
[01:07:16.400 --> 01:07:18.400]  For those to make it sustainable
[01:07:20.400 --> 01:07:22.400]  The 1996 sustainability
[01:07:22.400 --> 01:07:24.400]  UN Biological Diversity Assessment
[01:07:24.400 --> 01:07:26.400]  I have it in my film Road to Tourney
[01:07:26.400 --> 01:07:28.400]  Screenshots actually says
[01:07:28.400 --> 01:07:30.400]  Use war to reduce population
[01:07:30.400 --> 01:07:32.400]  And calls for putting
[01:07:32.400 --> 01:07:34.400]  Residents in the water, just like White House
[01:07:34.400 --> 01:07:36.400]  Scientists are, John P. Holdren does
[01:07:36.400 --> 01:07:38.400]  By the way, they're already adding it
[01:07:38.400 --> 01:07:40.400]  It's called sodium fluoride
[01:07:40.400 --> 01:07:42.400]  It reduces fertility, gives you a 7-fold increase
[01:07:42.400 --> 01:07:44.400]  In bone cancer alone
[01:07:44.400 --> 01:07:46.400]  And we just earlier showed you the
[01:07:46.400 --> 01:07:48.400]  UN Zone site
[01:07:48.400 --> 01:07:50.400]  In fact, I have another article right here
[01:07:50.400 --> 01:07:52.400]  UN Panel says Retoo World Economy
[01:07:52.400 --> 01:07:54.400]  For Sustainability
[01:07:54.400 --> 01:07:56.400]  And the UN will decide
[01:07:56.400 --> 01:07:58.400]  Under treaty what you can do
[01:07:58.400 --> 01:08:00.400]  And now when I go in restaurants
[01:08:00.400 --> 01:08:02.400]  They want water, it's not good for the earth
[01:08:02.400 --> 01:08:04.400]  Meanwhile, the major corporations
[01:08:04.400 --> 01:08:06.400]  Can do whatever they want, they can release GMO
[01:08:06.400 --> 01:08:08.400]  Toxic waste, none of that's a problem
[01:08:08.400 --> 01:08:10.400]  It's about teaching you your bad
[01:08:10.400 --> 01:08:12.400]  So, as the World Bank says
[01:08:12.400 --> 01:08:14.400]  By taxing carbon, what you exhale
[01:08:14.400 --> 01:08:16.400]  They can control all human activity
[01:08:16.400 --> 01:08:18.400]  And they always point a camera
[01:08:18.400 --> 01:08:20.400]  At a smokestack releasing water vapor
[01:08:20.400 --> 01:08:22.400]  On a cold day, just like when you breathe
[01:08:22.400 --> 01:08:24.400]  And say, oh look, it's toxic waste
[01:08:24.400 --> 01:08:26.400]  Nothing's coming out of the cold plants
[01:08:26.400 --> 01:08:28.400]  But water vapor and carbon dioxide
[01:08:28.400 --> 01:08:30.400]  So you control everything that way
[01:08:30.400 --> 01:08:32.400]  But didn't you also say all human
[01:08:32.400 --> 01:08:34.400]  Activities bad and the bureaucrats
[01:08:34.400 --> 01:08:36.400]  Under global standardized rules
[01:08:36.400 --> 01:08:38.400]  They will decide everything you can do
[01:08:38.400 --> 01:08:40.400]  Now, as my guest pointed out
[01:08:40.400 --> 01:08:42.400]  It's going to get a lot worse under this
[01:08:42.400 --> 01:08:44.400]  And California is the model
[01:08:44.400 --> 01:08:46.400]  Austin's kind of a satellite of that
[01:08:46.400 --> 01:08:48.400]  But you're already living under this
[01:08:48.400 --> 01:08:50.400]  So she's got the floor for the rest of the hour
[01:08:50.400 --> 01:08:52.400]  She is just an amazing researcher
[01:08:52.400 --> 01:08:54.400]  And author of Behind the Green Mask
[01:08:54.400 --> 01:08:56.400]  We have a link at infowars.com
[01:08:56.400 --> 01:08:58.400]  Where you can find it
[01:08:58.400 --> 01:09:00.400]  I'm going to carry this book on our
[01:09:00.400 --> 01:09:02.400]  Online video bookstore, it's so amazing
[01:09:02.400 --> 01:09:04.400]  But again, the reason she blows me away
[01:09:04.400 --> 01:09:06.400]  Is when I heard her on the radio for an hour
[01:09:06.400 --> 01:09:08.400]  The other day, everything she was saying
[01:09:08.400 --> 01:09:10.400]  I knew was true, but the way she was tying it together
[01:09:10.400 --> 01:09:12.400]  And again, it's so frustrating
[01:09:12.400 --> 01:09:14.400]  When you know criminals are taking over
[01:09:14.400 --> 01:09:16.400]  While selling you that they're saving you
[01:09:16.400 --> 01:09:18.400]  It's so sick, you just want to beat them
[01:09:18.400 --> 01:09:20.400]  And it's Naziism
[01:09:20.400 --> 01:09:22.400]  The Nazis said the earth was overpopulated
[01:09:22.400 --> 01:09:24.400]  And they were going to have environmentalism
[01:09:24.400 --> 01:09:26.400]  It's about a power grab
[01:09:26.400 --> 01:09:29.400]  So, Rosa Corey, executive director
[01:09:29.400 --> 01:09:31.400]  Of Post Sustainability Institute
[01:09:31.400 --> 01:09:33.400]  A forensic commercial real estate appraiser
[01:09:33.400 --> 01:09:35.400]  Break down again briefly for those that just joined us
[01:09:35.400 --> 01:09:38.400]  What it is, the global standardization
[01:09:38.400 --> 01:09:41.400]  And how they're controlling our local towns and cities
[01:09:41.400 --> 01:09:45.400]  To openly just triple charges for water
[01:09:45.400 --> 01:09:47.400]  Quadruple charges for power
[01:09:47.400 --> 01:09:49.400]  To pay mega corporations like Ken Lay
[01:09:49.400 --> 01:09:51.400]  Who came up with the plan
[01:09:51.400 --> 01:09:52.400]  You've got the floor
[01:09:52.400 --> 01:09:54.400]  Right, well, you know, this is it
[01:09:54.400 --> 01:09:57.400]  It's a corporatocracy and it is being instated
[01:09:57.400 --> 01:10:01.400]  To develop a totalitarian government
[01:10:01.400 --> 01:10:03.400]  Over you, it is one world government
[01:10:03.400 --> 01:10:05.400]  This is globalization
[01:10:05.400 --> 01:10:08.400]  And it's being instated slowly
[01:10:08.400 --> 01:10:10.400]  Somewhat slowly, although it's speeding up now
[01:10:10.400 --> 01:10:13.400]  Because we're finding that we're experiencing
[01:10:13.400 --> 01:10:15.400]  Regionalization now
[01:10:15.400 --> 01:10:17.400]  Which is the erasure of quarters
[01:10:17.400 --> 01:10:20.400]  Between cities, counties, states
[01:10:20.400 --> 01:10:22.400]  And ultimately, nations
[01:10:22.400 --> 01:10:24.400]  And when you lose your sovereignty
[01:10:24.400 --> 01:10:26.400]  You don't want to just look at it
[01:10:26.400 --> 01:10:28.400]  In terms of losing your national sovereignty
[01:10:28.400 --> 01:10:30.400]  You also lose your sovereignty
[01:10:30.400 --> 01:10:32.400]  Over your person, over yourself
[01:10:32.400 --> 01:10:34.400]  So you have the, for instance
[01:10:34.400 --> 01:10:36.400]  The National Defense Authorization Act
[01:10:36.400 --> 01:10:39.400]  Which defines enemy combatants
[01:10:39.400 --> 01:10:42.400]  As being people who are very much like ourselves
[01:10:42.400 --> 01:10:44.400]  Who are here in the United States
[01:10:44.400 --> 01:10:46.400]  So this plan, it's a global plan
[01:10:46.400 --> 01:10:48.400]  But it's implemented locally
[01:10:48.400 --> 01:10:50.400]  And if you think it's not affecting you right now
[01:10:50.400 --> 01:10:52.400]  I'll tell you that you are wrong
[01:10:52.400 --> 01:10:54.400]  It's impacting you immediately
[01:10:54.400 --> 01:10:57.400]  In your own city, in your town, out in the world
[01:10:57.400 --> 01:10:59.400]  It's designed in their words
[01:10:59.400 --> 01:11:00.400]  To shut down the economy
[01:11:00.400 --> 01:11:02.400]  Look at the economy shutting down
[01:11:02.400 --> 01:11:04.400]  They know what they're doing
[01:11:04.400 --> 01:11:06.400]  That's right, this is designed to
[01:11:06.400 --> 01:11:08.400]  Your economy is designed to be destroyed
[01:11:08.400 --> 01:11:10.400]  This, you know, if an enemy
[01:11:10.400 --> 01:11:12.400]  Were trying to destroy the country
[01:11:12.400 --> 01:11:14.400]  They couldn't do a better job
[01:11:14.400 --> 01:11:16.400]  Than this plan
[01:11:16.400 --> 01:11:18.400]  And that is the plan
[01:11:18.400 --> 01:11:20.400]  That is what the desired result is
[01:11:20.400 --> 01:11:23.400]  Because the more dependent people you have
[01:11:23.400 --> 01:11:25.400]  And the less people who own private property
[01:11:25.400 --> 01:11:27.400]  The less people there are to care
[01:11:27.400 --> 01:11:29.400]  If there is private property
[01:11:29.400 --> 01:11:31.400]  And private property rights
[01:11:31.400 --> 01:11:33.400]  And the less people there are to stand up
[01:11:33.400 --> 01:11:35.400]  And say that it's wrong
[01:11:35.400 --> 01:11:37.400]  And you are your ultimate private property
[01:11:37.400 --> 01:11:39.400]  So what's happening now
[01:11:39.400 --> 01:11:41.400]  Is that we are losing our rights
[01:11:41.400 --> 01:11:44.400]  Over our private property, over our water
[01:11:44.400 --> 01:11:46.400]  Over our land
[01:11:46.400 --> 01:11:48.400]  You're finding people in the rural areas
[01:11:48.400 --> 01:11:50.400]  Are being moved out of the rural areas
[01:11:50.400 --> 01:11:52.400]  Into the cities
[01:11:52.400 --> 01:11:55.400]  And the cities are being replanned
[01:11:55.400 --> 01:11:58.400]  To have high density urban development
[01:11:58.400 --> 01:12:00.400]  What that means is that smart growth
[01:12:00.400 --> 01:12:02.400]  Which is ground floor retail
[01:12:02.400 --> 01:12:04.400]  With several stories of residential above
[01:12:04.400 --> 01:12:06.400]  Built right to the edge of the sidewalk
[01:12:06.400 --> 01:12:08.400]  Right in the center of your town
[01:12:08.400 --> 01:12:10.400]  On a supposed transportation line
[01:12:10.400 --> 01:12:12.400]  Whether it's there or not
[01:12:12.400 --> 01:12:14.400]  And oftentimes being
[01:12:14.400 --> 01:12:16.400]  Using your property tax dollars
[01:12:16.400 --> 01:12:18.400]  To pay for that
[01:12:18.400 --> 01:12:20.400]  And what happens is
[01:12:20.400 --> 01:12:22.400]  People in the rural areas
[01:12:22.400 --> 01:12:24.400]  Find that, oh well
[01:12:24.400 --> 01:12:26.400]  You've just said it, pay dust is now
[01:12:26.400 --> 01:12:28.400]  Considered to be an environmental pollutant
[01:12:28.400 --> 01:12:30.400]  You find that your roads
[01:12:30.400 --> 01:12:32.400]  Are being pulverized
[01:12:32.400 --> 01:12:34.400]  And turned to dust out in the rural areas
[01:12:34.400 --> 01:12:36.400]  Your well is being monitored
[01:12:36.400 --> 01:12:38.400]  So you may not have the use of your water
[01:12:38.400 --> 01:12:40.400]  You think you own your land
[01:12:40.400 --> 01:12:42.400]  Right from the center
[01:12:42.400 --> 01:12:44.400]  Of the earth, right to the sky
[01:12:44.400 --> 01:12:46.400]  But you don't, not anymore
[01:12:46.400 --> 01:12:48.400]  Because this is a communitarian plan
[01:12:48.400 --> 01:12:50.400]  It's the plan
[01:12:50.400 --> 01:12:52.400]  That actually balances
[01:12:52.400 --> 01:12:54.400]  Individuals' rights
[01:12:54.400 --> 01:12:56.400]  Against the rights of the community
[01:12:56.400 --> 01:12:58.400]  In this case we're talking about
[01:12:58.400 --> 01:13:00.400]  The global community
[01:13:00.400 --> 01:13:02.400]  And the individual always loses
[01:13:02.400 --> 01:13:04.400]  And the bureaucrats always decide
[01:13:04.400 --> 01:13:06.400]  The part you were breaking down
[01:13:06.400 --> 01:13:08.400]  Is how these regional governments
[01:13:08.400 --> 01:13:10.400]  End up getting the tax money
[01:13:10.400 --> 01:13:12.400]  So the local government becomes a total vassal
[01:13:12.400 --> 01:13:14.400]  And now they have actual corporations
[01:13:14.400 --> 01:13:16.400]  In Rhode Island, in Michigan
[01:13:16.400 --> 01:13:18.400]  And other areas saying no city council
[01:13:18.400 --> 01:13:20.400]  Period anymore
[01:13:20.400 --> 01:13:22.400]  And we're going to triple your water
[01:13:22.400 --> 01:13:24.400]  To pay it to ourselves
[01:13:24.400 --> 01:13:26.400]  Even though it's a foreign corporation
[01:13:26.400 --> 01:13:28.400]  And it's not even a free market
[01:13:28.400 --> 01:13:30.400]  This isn't privatization
[01:13:30.400 --> 01:13:32.400]  It's just pure hijacking
[01:13:32.400 --> 01:13:34.400]  And then the actual Austin City Council said
[01:13:34.400 --> 01:13:36.400]  We're going to give you 20-80% increases
[01:13:36.400 --> 01:13:38.400]  And it's for the earth
[01:13:38.400 --> 01:13:40.400]  Yeah, that's right
[01:13:40.400 --> 01:13:42.400]  You see community aggregate
[01:13:42.400 --> 01:13:44.400]  Energy aggregation
[01:13:44.400 --> 01:13:46.400]  Where now your town is supposed
[01:13:46.400 --> 01:13:48.400]  To be going into the energy business
[01:13:48.400 --> 01:13:50.400]  And they're going to put up a big solar array
[01:13:50.400 --> 01:13:52.400]  And you're going to be paying for it
[01:13:52.400 --> 01:13:54.400]  And this is the way that they sink your economy
[01:13:54.400 --> 01:13:56.400]  When you look at it from that point of view
[01:13:56.400 --> 01:13:58.400]  High-speed trains are a total failure
[01:13:58.400 --> 01:14:00.400]  And a way to lose
[01:14:00.400 --> 01:14:02.400]  Your total control over your ability
[01:14:02.400 --> 01:14:04.400]  To spend your transportation dollars
[01:14:04.400 --> 01:14:06.400]  Because there's never going to be enough money
[01:14:06.400 --> 01:14:08.400]  For those high-speed trains
[01:14:08.400 --> 01:14:10.400]  And this is a way to
[01:14:10.400 --> 01:14:12.400]  Enforce regionalization
[01:14:12.400 --> 01:14:14.400]  They are building blocks
[01:14:14.400 --> 01:14:16.400]  For mega regions
[01:14:16.400 --> 01:14:18.400]  And we have those right now
[01:14:18.400 --> 01:14:20.400]  In the United States
[01:14:20.400 --> 01:14:22.400]  You've got your local regions
[01:14:22.400 --> 01:14:24.400]  Within your states
[01:14:24.400 --> 01:14:26.400]  And sometimes breaking the borders
[01:14:26.400 --> 01:14:28.400]  And then you've got 11 mega regions
[01:14:28.400 --> 01:14:30.400]  In the United States
[01:14:30.400 --> 01:14:32.400]  You've got 50 states
[01:14:32.400 --> 01:14:34.400]  11 mega regions
[01:14:34.400 --> 01:14:36.400]  And you can go to
[01:14:36.400 --> 01:14:38.400]  America2050.org
[01:14:38.400 --> 01:14:40.400]  If you want to check that out
[01:14:40.400 --> 01:14:42.400]  Yeah, the governments and the UN
[01:14:42.400 --> 01:14:44.400]  Admit all this and the New York Times comes out
[01:14:44.400 --> 01:14:46.400]  And says, yeah, the UN's taken over
[01:14:46.400 --> 01:14:48.400]  But you're bad because you don't want it
[01:14:48.400 --> 01:14:50.400]  I have a map here based on a UN
[01:14:50.400 --> 01:14:52.400]  Documents that was that Congress
[01:14:52.400 --> 01:14:54.400]  presented
[01:14:54.400 --> 01:14:56.400]  And it shows more than half the US
[01:14:56.400 --> 01:14:58.400]  Off limits
[01:14:58.400 --> 01:15:00.400]  And people are like, they'll never do that
[01:15:00.400 --> 01:15:02.400]  They've taken over third-world countries
[01:15:02.400 --> 01:15:04.400]  I've seen National Geographic where armed guards
[01:15:04.400 --> 01:15:06.400]  Keep people out of the biospheres
[01:15:06.400 --> 01:15:08.400]  And what it's really about is making
[01:15:08.400 --> 01:15:10.400]  The insiders' property values
[01:15:10.400 --> 01:15:12.400]  Go up. They shut off
[01:15:12.400 --> 01:15:14.400]  America being able to mine Utah clean-burning coal
[01:15:14.400 --> 01:15:16.400]  That doubles the value
[01:15:16.400 --> 01:15:18.400]  Of the Chinese coal overnight
[01:15:18.400 --> 01:15:20.400]  They shut down our pipeline out of Canada for oil
[01:15:20.400 --> 01:15:22.400]  Now Warren Buffett doubles his money
[01:15:22.400 --> 01:15:24.400]  Bloomberg reported overnight
[01:15:24.400 --> 01:15:26.400]  Shipping it by train to the west coast
[01:15:26.400 --> 01:15:28.400]  To ships to go to China
[01:15:28.400 --> 01:15:30.400]  Sustainable development is selectively enforced
[01:15:32.400 --> 01:15:34.400]  Incredible. Stay there.
[01:15:34.400 --> 01:15:36.400]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is so mind-blowing
[01:15:36.400 --> 01:15:38.400]  And I've seen the UN meetings
[01:15:38.400 --> 01:15:40.400]  I've been to them. It's all public
[01:15:40.400 --> 01:15:42.400]  How they're going to pulverize our roads
[01:15:42.400 --> 01:15:44.400]  They're already cutting off the funding
[01:15:44.400 --> 01:15:46.400]  You can only then get on the big roads
[01:15:46.400 --> 01:15:48.400]  They've built with huge toll roads
[01:15:48.400 --> 01:15:50.400]  On it. It is so nightmarish
[01:15:50.400 --> 01:15:52.400]  And it has nothing to do
[01:15:52.400 --> 01:15:54.400]  With the environment. We're going to come back
[01:15:54.400 --> 01:15:56.400]  And break down this takeover
[01:15:56.400 --> 01:15:58.400]  With our guest Rosa Corey. Stay with us.
[01:16:00.400 --> 01:16:02.400]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons
[01:16:02.400 --> 01:16:04.400]  You should consider buying a solar power generator
[01:16:04.400 --> 01:16:06.400]  Number one, new climate legislation
[01:16:06.400 --> 01:16:08.400]  Could easily double or triple your electric bill
[01:16:08.400 --> 01:16:10.400]  Number two, our new energies are
[01:16:10.400 --> 01:16:12.400]  Wants to control how much power
[01:16:12.400 --> 01:16:14.400]  Your electric company allows you to have
[01:16:14.400 --> 01:16:16.400]  It's true. Total government control
[01:16:16.400 --> 01:16:18.400]  Of electricity in the name of
[01:16:18.400 --> 01:16:20.400]  Smart grid technology is coming
[01:16:20.400 --> 01:16:22.400]  Number three, in some areas of the country
[01:16:22.400 --> 01:16:24.400]  The power grid is dangerously overloaded
[01:16:24.400 --> 01:16:26.400]  And now, new socialist legislation
[01:16:26.400 --> 01:16:28.400]  Is only compounding the problem
[01:16:28.400 --> 01:16:30.400]  Number four, dangerous weather
[01:16:30.400 --> 01:16:32.400]  Is always a threat to local grids
[01:16:32.400 --> 01:16:34.400]  Every year, thousands of families lose
[01:16:34.400 --> 01:16:36.400]  Their power from weather related onages
[01:16:36.400 --> 01:16:38.400]  Number five, a solar power generator
[01:16:38.400 --> 01:16:40.400]  Provides powerful backup insurance
[01:16:40.400 --> 01:16:42.400]  And peace of mind. Folks, I really believe
[01:16:42.400 --> 01:16:44.400]  In the solar power generators offered by
[01:16:44.400 --> 01:16:46.400]  Solutions from Science, one of my old

[01:17:24.400 --> 01:17:26.400]  Deodorants or antibacterials
[01:17:26.400 --> 01:17:28.400]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous
[01:17:28.400 --> 01:17:30.400]  Toxic detergents that give you rashes
[01:17:30.400 --> 01:17:32.400]  Itching sores, and a
[01:17:32.400 --> 01:17:34.400]  Terorating clothing called lint
[01:17:34.400 --> 01:17:36.400]  If you want something better, if you want
[01:17:36.400 --> 01:17:38.400]  Something you've never had before
[01:17:38.400 --> 01:17:40.400]  You have to do something you've never done before

[01:20:22.400 --> 01:20:24.400]  We're going back to our guest
[01:20:24.400 --> 01:20:26.400]  We're giving you an in depth report
[01:20:26.400 --> 01:20:28.400]  On Agenda 21
[01:20:28.400 --> 01:20:30.400]  Sustainability, smart growth
[01:20:30.400 --> 01:20:32.400]  All of it
[01:20:32.400 --> 01:20:34.400]  Now remember
[01:20:34.400 --> 01:20:36.400]  I've noticed that I've seen all over the country
[01:20:36.400 --> 01:20:38.400]  There's Democrats against smart growth
[01:20:38.400 --> 01:20:40.400]  Democrats against Agenda 21
[01:20:40.400 --> 01:20:42.400]  The liberals are waking up to this right now
[01:20:42.400 --> 01:20:44.400]  Because especially in California
[01:20:44.400 --> 01:20:46.400]  It is tyranny
[01:20:46.400 --> 01:20:48.400]  Here in Austin under Save Our Springs
[01:20:48.400 --> 01:20:50.400]  They take 15,000 acres of ranchers property
[01:20:50.400 --> 01:20:52.400]  Give them 5 cents on the dollar
[01:20:52.400 --> 01:20:54.400]  Or less, make them sell it
[01:20:54.400 --> 01:20:56.400]  Eminent domain, that's what she's an expert in
[01:20:56.400 --> 01:20:58.400]  And then they turn around and
[01:20:58.400 --> 01:21:00.400]  Sell it off to the former mayor's buddies
[01:21:00.400 --> 01:21:02.400]  And they build luxury million dollar homes on it
[01:21:02.400 --> 01:21:04.400]  And shopping malls
[01:21:04.400 --> 01:21:06.400]  And spas and hotels
[01:21:06.400 --> 01:21:08.400]  And they just laugh about it
[01:21:08.400 --> 01:21:10.400]  I mean it's
[01:21:10.400 --> 01:21:12.400]  So again, stuff's going to get developed
[01:21:12.400 --> 01:21:14.400]  This is not about the environment
[01:21:14.400 --> 01:21:16.400]  It's about insiders
[01:21:16.400 --> 01:21:18.400]  Controlling everything you can do
[01:21:18.400 --> 01:21:20.400]  And artificially
[01:21:20.400 --> 01:21:22.400]  Not letting you have your own well water
[01:21:22.400 --> 01:21:24.400]  That's already starting
[01:21:24.400 --> 01:21:26.400]  Rosa Corey, continue
[01:21:26.400 --> 01:21:28.400]  How this is already affecting people
[01:21:28.400 --> 01:21:30.400]  How it targets the world
[01:21:30.400 --> 01:21:32.400]  To force us into the compact cities
[01:21:32.400 --> 01:21:34.400]  How it's already, and again
[01:21:34.400 --> 01:21:36.400]  Get back into how they control the zoning boards
[01:21:36.400 --> 01:21:38.400]  Because it's all on record
[01:21:38.400 --> 01:21:40.400]  And it's global standardization
[01:21:40.400 --> 01:21:42.400]  Continuity of Agenda worldwide
[01:21:42.400 --> 01:21:44.400]  This is New World Order
[01:21:44.400 --> 01:21:46.400]  I showed AFP, Associated Press
[01:21:46.400 --> 01:21:48.400]  Global government, global tax
[01:21:48.400 --> 01:21:50.400]  Through this, go ahead
[01:21:50.400 --> 01:21:52.400]  Yeah, well that's saying a lot
[01:21:52.400 --> 01:21:54.400]  You know, we, I just want to go back
[01:21:54.400 --> 01:21:56.400]  To what you just said about
[01:21:56.400 --> 01:21:58.400]  The fact is, this is not a
[01:21:58.400 --> 01:22:00.400]  Left-right issue, it's not a liberal
[01:22:00.400 --> 01:22:02.400]  Conservative issue
[01:22:02.400 --> 01:22:04.400]  It's an American issue
[01:22:04.400 --> 01:22:06.400]  I happen to be a liberal Democrat
[01:22:06.400 --> 01:22:08.400]  There are many people who are
[01:22:08.400 --> 01:22:10.400]  Waking up to this, who are liberal
[01:22:10.400 --> 01:22:12.400]  And we have a group that's Democrats
[01:22:12.400 --> 01:22:14.400]  Against UN Agenda
[01:22:14.400 --> 01:22:16.400]  21.com
[01:22:16.400 --> 01:22:18.400]  You know, when we talk about
[01:22:18.400 --> 01:22:20.400]  Sustainability, first of all
[01:22:20.400 --> 01:22:22.400]  Sustainable development is
[01:22:22.400 --> 01:22:24.400]  United Nations Agenda 21
[01:22:24.400 --> 01:22:26.400]  So you've heard that term
[01:22:26.400 --> 01:22:28.400]  But what is unsustainable
[01:22:28.400 --> 01:22:30.400]  According to the United Nations
[01:22:30.400 --> 01:22:32.400]  And according to your government
[01:22:32.400 --> 01:22:34.400]  As well, the American government
[01:22:34.400 --> 01:22:36.400]  Single family homes
[01:22:36.400 --> 01:22:38.400]  Private vehicles
[01:22:38.400 --> 01:22:40.400]  Appliances
[01:22:40.400 --> 01:22:42.400]  Meat-eating
[01:22:42.400 --> 01:22:44.400]  Course golf courses
[01:22:44.400 --> 01:22:46.400]  And many, many other things
[01:22:46.400 --> 01:22:48.400]  Were identified
[01:22:48.400 --> 01:22:50.400]  As being unsustainable
[01:22:50.400 --> 01:22:52.400]  And so you want to say to yourself
[01:22:52.400 --> 01:22:54.400]  Well, what kind of impact
[01:22:54.400 --> 01:22:56.400]  Is this going to have on my quality
[01:22:56.400 --> 01:22:58.400]  Of life? And I tell you
[01:22:58.400 --> 01:23:00.400]  It's having an incredible impact
[01:23:00.400 --> 01:23:02.400]  On your life right now
[01:23:02.400 --> 01:23:04.400]  Because as I was saying earlier
[01:23:04.400 --> 01:23:06.400]  The President's Council on
[01:23:06.400 --> 01:23:08.400]  Sustainable Development
[01:23:08.400 --> 01:23:10.400]  Paid the American Planning Association
[01:23:10.400 --> 01:23:12.400]  Up with a guide
[01:23:12.400 --> 01:23:14.400]  That is now in every single
[01:23:14.400 --> 01:23:16.400]  Planning department
[01:23:16.400 --> 01:23:18.400]  And every single university and college
[01:23:18.400 --> 01:23:20.400]  In the entire United States
[01:23:20.400 --> 01:23:22.400]  And it's called Growing Smart
[01:23:22.400 --> 01:23:24.400]  A legislative guidebook
[01:23:24.400 --> 01:23:26.400]  With model statutes
[01:23:26.400 --> 01:23:28.400]  For planning and the management
[01:23:28.400 --> 01:23:30.400]  Of change
[01:23:30.400 --> 01:23:32.400]  And just think about that, you know
[01:23:32.400 --> 01:23:34.400]  The UN and Kinley who wrote all this
[01:23:34.400 --> 01:23:36.400]  Will control everything and
[01:23:36.400 --> 01:23:38.400]  Can selectively enforce it
[01:23:38.400 --> 01:23:40.400]  In a country by bureaucratic evil
[01:23:40.400 --> 01:23:42.400]  I'm sorry, go ahead.
[01:23:42.400 --> 01:23:44.400]  It's true, well you know
[01:23:44.400 --> 01:23:46.400]  You referred to Kinley and he's supposedly dead
[01:23:46.400 --> 01:23:48.400]  But I kind of don't believe that
[01:23:48.400 --> 01:23:50.400]  But you know this was
[01:23:50.400 --> 01:23:52.400]  Captains of Industry, it's a
[01:23:52.400 --> 01:23:54.400]  Corporateocracy is what it is
[01:23:54.400 --> 01:23:56.400]  Public-private partnerships
[01:23:56.400 --> 01:23:58.400]  Are your government
[01:23:58.400 --> 01:24:00.400]  Combined with corporations
[01:24:00.400 --> 01:24:02.400]  Combined with non-profit groups
[01:24:02.400 --> 01:24:04.400]  NGOs which are
[01:24:04.400 --> 01:24:06.400]  Specific non-profit groups
[01:24:06.400 --> 01:24:08.400]  By the United Nations
[01:24:08.400 --> 01:24:10.400]  And they pick the winners and losers
[01:24:10.400 --> 01:24:12.400]  It's this inside
[01:24:12.400 --> 01:24:14.400]  Crony capitalist model
[01:24:14.400 --> 01:24:16.400]  That's why Mitt Romney and all the major Republicans
[01:24:16.400 --> 01:24:18.400]  Absolutely worship this
[01:24:18.400 --> 01:24:20.400]  Yeah, well you know
[01:24:20.400 --> 01:24:22.400]  There's no silver bullet for this
[01:24:22.400 --> 01:24:24.400]  You're not gonna be getting
[01:24:24.400 --> 01:24:26.400]  I shouldn't say you would
[01:24:26.400 --> 01:24:28.400]  Never get a politician who
[01:24:28.400 --> 01:24:30.400]  Would fight this for you
[01:24:30.400 --> 01:24:32.400]  But you know it's up to all of us
[01:24:32.400 --> 01:24:34.400]  To make bad politicians do the right thing
[01:24:34.400 --> 01:24:36.400]  And so I really want to
[01:24:36.400 --> 01:24:38.400]  Encourage people not to be panicked
[01:24:38.400 --> 01:24:40.400]  Or paralyzed by this
[01:24:40.400 --> 01:24:42.400]  We need to take power
[01:24:42.400 --> 01:24:44.400]  And we are doing it, I'm glad to hear that
[01:24:44.400 --> 01:24:46.400]  You're the headquarters of the resistance
[01:24:46.400 --> 01:24:48.400]  Because I thought I was
[01:24:48.400 --> 01:24:50.400]  But we are being, you know
[01:24:50.400 --> 01:24:52.400]  This is the resistance, don't be a good
[01:24:52.400 --> 01:24:54.400]  German and go along to get along
[01:24:54.400 --> 01:24:56.400]  These are land use plans
[01:24:56.400 --> 01:24:58.400]  They're designed to get you out of the rural
[01:24:58.400 --> 01:25:00.400]  Areas and into the center of your city
[01:25:00.400 --> 01:25:02.400]  And they're
[01:25:02.400 --> 01:25:04.400]  With every single one of these plans
[01:25:04.400 --> 01:25:06.400]  It's called vision
[01:25:06.400 --> 01:25:08.400]  Your town or your town
[01:25:08.400 --> 01:25:10.400]  2050 or 2035
[01:25:10.400 --> 01:25:12.400]  And they're gonna call you
[01:25:12.400 --> 01:25:14.400]  To come on down and give your opinion
[01:25:14.400 --> 01:25:16.400]  Of this great new plan for your town
[01:25:16.400 --> 01:25:18.400]  And what they're gonna do
[01:25:18.400 --> 01:25:20.400]  When you get there is DelphiU
[01:25:20.400 --> 01:25:22.400]  Which is a rand corporation
[01:25:22.400 --> 01:25:24.400]  Mind control technique
[01:25:24.400 --> 01:25:26.400]  That is now being used on you
[01:25:26.400 --> 01:25:28.400]  By your government
[01:25:28.400 --> 01:25:30.400]  In almost every government meeting
[01:25:30.400 --> 01:25:32.400]  You're going to
[01:25:32.400 --> 01:25:34.400]  You've never seen so many people's opinions
[01:25:34.400 --> 01:25:36.400]  Being solicited by your government before
[01:25:36.400 --> 01:25:38.400]  And the fact is that it's just
[01:25:38.400 --> 01:25:40.400]  The illusion of asking for your opinion
[01:25:40.400 --> 01:25:42.400]  This is a
[01:25:42.400 --> 01:25:44.400]  It's a window dressing
[01:25:44.400 --> 01:25:46.400]  You are merely window dressing for these plans
[01:25:46.400 --> 01:25:48.400]  These plans are pre-designed
[01:25:48.400 --> 01:25:50.400]  Pre-approved
[01:25:50.400 --> 01:25:52.400]  I've actually read the rand corporation
[01:25:52.400 --> 01:25:54.400]  I'm glad you raised that, they're DelphiU
[01:25:54.400 --> 01:25:56.400]  It does two things, it makes you think
[01:25:56.400 --> 01:25:58.400]  You're being listened to
[01:25:58.400 --> 01:26:00.400]  People like you're at the table
[01:26:00.400 --> 01:26:02.400]  But then they also gather intelligence
[01:26:02.400 --> 01:26:04.400]  On you in the process
[01:26:04.400 --> 01:26:06.400]  And they train all these city people
[01:26:06.400 --> 01:26:08.400]  How to Delphi and you're absolutely right
[01:26:08.400 --> 01:26:10.400]  As for us being the center of the resistance
[01:26:10.400 --> 01:26:12.400]  In wide spectrum resistance to the new world order
[01:26:12.400 --> 01:26:14.400]  But everyone out there
[01:26:14.400 --> 01:26:16.400]  If you're listening to my voice
[01:26:16.400 --> 01:26:18.400]  You are the center of the resistance
[01:26:18.400 --> 01:26:20.400]  Against this global corporatocracy
[01:26:20.400 --> 01:26:22.400]  But I agree with you, the work you're doing
[01:26:22.400 --> 01:26:24.400]  Is some of the most piercing and focused
[01:26:24.400 --> 01:26:26.400]  When it comes to their key blueprint
[01:26:26.400 --> 01:26:28.400]  Now continuing though
[01:26:28.400 --> 01:26:30.400]  How they're standardizing it
[01:26:30.400 --> 01:26:32.400]  Because we were talking
[01:26:32.400 --> 01:26:34.400]  About how scared the system is
[01:26:34.400 --> 01:26:36.400]  And how they're now putting out manuals
[01:26:36.400 --> 01:26:38.400]  To cities, to how to counter
[01:26:38.400 --> 01:26:40.400]  How to laugh at you
[01:26:40.400 --> 01:26:42.400]  How to act like you're crazy
[01:26:42.400 --> 01:26:44.400]  The New York Times is coming out
[01:26:44.400 --> 01:26:46.400]  Freaking out saying there's people everywhere
[01:26:46.400 --> 01:26:48.400]  Fighting us, our agenda's in trouble
[01:26:48.400 --> 01:26:50.400]  And of course the next day they had an article
[01:26:50.400 --> 01:26:52.400]  About getting rid of the constitution
[01:26:52.400 --> 01:26:54.400]  They're showing themselves to be foreign
[01:26:54.400 --> 01:26:56.400]  Fighters
[01:26:56.400 --> 01:26:58.400]  That's exactly right
[01:26:58.400 --> 01:27:00.400]  And you'll see this propaganda
[01:27:00.400 --> 01:27:02.400]  It's containment
[01:27:02.400 --> 01:27:04.400]  And the reason that they've got it out there
[01:27:04.400 --> 01:27:06.400]  They're really bringing out their guns now
[01:27:06.400 --> 01:27:08.400]  Is that, well not quite
[01:27:08.400 --> 01:27:10.400]  But they will
[01:27:10.400 --> 01:27:12.400]  But this is all about controlling us
[01:27:12.400 --> 01:27:14.400]  It's a totalitarian state
[01:27:14.400 --> 01:27:16.400]  That's being developed right now
[01:27:16.400 --> 01:27:18.400]  And so acquiring information about you
[01:27:18.400 --> 01:27:20.400]  The American Planning Association
[01:27:20.400 --> 01:27:22.400]  Is out there right now giving seminars
[01:27:22.400 --> 01:27:24.400]  About how to control and manage
[01:27:24.400 --> 01:27:26.400]  The people who like us
[01:27:26.400 --> 01:27:28.400]  Who show up at their meetings
[01:27:28.400 --> 01:27:30.400]  Who say hey we don't want to be delfied
[01:27:30.400 --> 01:27:32.400]  We don't want your plan
[01:27:32.400 --> 01:27:34.400]  Take your dog and pony show and get out of our town
[01:27:34.400 --> 01:27:36.400]  And I want you to know
[01:27:36.400 --> 01:27:38.400]  We're doing this all over the United States
[01:27:38.400 --> 01:27:40.400]  People are standing up
[01:27:40.400 --> 01:27:42.400]  And saying no
[01:27:42.400 --> 01:27:44.400]  We will not accept regional plans
[01:27:44.400 --> 01:27:46.400]  We will not accept dissolution
[01:27:46.400 --> 01:27:48.400]  And destruction
[01:27:48.400 --> 01:27:50.400]  Of our form of government
[01:27:50.400 --> 01:27:52.400]  City, county, state, and federal
[01:27:52.400 --> 01:27:54.400]  And you want to make sure
[01:27:54.400 --> 01:27:56.400]  That you keep it that way because these are
[01:27:56.400 --> 01:27:58.400]  Unelected boards that are made up
[01:27:58.400 --> 01:28:00.400]  Possibly of elected officials
[01:28:00.400 --> 01:28:02.400]  But they are designed to destroy
[01:28:02.400 --> 01:28:04.400]  The borders between cities,
[01:28:04.400 --> 01:28:06.400]  Counties, states, and nations
[01:28:06.400 --> 01:28:08.400]  In fact
[01:28:08.400 --> 01:28:10.400]  One of the, you know, the
[01:28:10.400 --> 01:28:12.400]  Regions, we've got one in northern California
[01:28:12.400 --> 01:28:14.400]  One of the mega regions
[01:28:14.400 --> 01:28:16.400]  It includes, you know, parts of Canada
[01:28:16.400 --> 01:28:18.400]  You've got the southern California mega region
[01:28:18.400 --> 01:28:20.400]  Part of Mexico
[01:28:20.400 --> 01:28:22.400]  You have these 11 mega regions
[01:28:22.400 --> 01:28:24.400]  Across the United States that are effectively
[01:28:24.400 --> 01:28:26.400]  Destroying your ability
[01:28:26.400 --> 01:28:28.400]  To have any impact at all on your government
[01:28:28.400 --> 01:28:30.400]  And this is not
[01:28:30.400 --> 01:28:32.400]  What we want as Americans
[01:28:32.400 --> 01:28:34.400]  They will want you to go along
[01:28:34.400 --> 01:28:36.400]  To get along
[01:28:36.400 --> 01:28:38.400]  Stay there, incredible, let's come back with solutions
[01:28:38.400 --> 01:28:40.400]  And more and break down how it's going to affect us
[01:28:40.400 --> 01:28:42.400]  In the future, you think it's bad now
[01:28:42.400 --> 01:28:44.400]  You ain't seen nothing yet
[01:28:44.400 --> 01:28:46.400]  I'm going to play you what they're showing
[01:28:46.400 --> 01:28:48.400]  In the U.S. and England
[01:28:48.400 --> 01:28:50.400]  Where they show them that every
[01:28:50.400 --> 01:28:52.400]  Fast of your life
[01:28:52.400 --> 01:28:54.400]  Is going to be controlled
[01:28:54.400 --> 01:28:56.400]  It is unbelievable criminality
[01:28:56.400 --> 01:28:58.400]  Stay with us
[01:29:00.400 --> 01:29:02.400]  A little over a year ago
[01:29:02.400 --> 01:29:04.400]  I began to do a lot of research into
[01:29:04.400 --> 01:29:06.400]  Why, even if I had a pretty good size
[01:29:06.400 --> 01:29:08.400]  Meal that I was still starving
[01:29:08.400 --> 01:29:10.400]  And my research led me to a well-known fact
[01:29:10.400 --> 01:29:12.400]  That most of the soils that we grow
[01:29:12.400 --> 01:29:14.400]  Our crops on here in the United States
[01:29:14.400 --> 01:29:16.400]  Across the industrialized world
[01:29:16.400 --> 01:29:18.400]  Are almost completely depleted
[01:29:18.400 --> 01:29:20.400]  Of almost all of the key minerals
[01:29:20.400 --> 01:29:22.400]  And trace elements that our bodies need
[01:29:22.400 --> 01:29:24.400]  To rebuild themselves, fight off cancer
[01:29:24.400 --> 01:29:26.400]  And be healthy
[01:29:26.400 --> 01:29:28.400]  I then searched out the best
[01:29:28.400 --> 01:29:30.400]  Vitamin and mineral company out there
[01:29:30.400 --> 01:29:32.400]  And discovered Young Jevity
[01:29:32.400 --> 01:29:34.400]  The Young Jevity products are designed
[01:29:34.400 --> 01:29:36.400]  To give you the real nutrition you need
[01:29:36.400 --> 01:29:38.400]  And once you've got that
[01:29:38.400 --> 01:29:40.400]  You don't have to eat as much to be satisfied
[01:29:40.400 --> 01:29:42.400]  I've lost 37 pounds
[01:29:42.400 --> 01:29:44.400]  In two months
[01:29:44.400 --> 01:29:46.400]  Simply getting the vitamins and minerals I need

[01:30:54.400 --> 01:30:56.400]  Non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item

[01:31:34.400 --> 01:31:36.400]  This includes the eyes
[01:31:36.400 --> 01:31:38.400]  Ears, nose, lungs
[01:31:38.400 --> 01:31:40.400]  Topically to the skin
[01:31:40.400 --> 01:31:42.400]  And orally for the digestive system
[01:31:42.400 --> 01:31:44.400]  Be sure to watch our new 7-minute video tour

[01:32:00.440 --> 01:32:03.400]  I've been telling you about eFoods Direct for a while now.
[01:32:03.400 --> 01:32:06.040]  Here are my top 10 reasons to stock up on food
[01:32:06.040 --> 01:32:07.080]  from eFoods Direct.
[01:32:07.080 --> 01:32:10.080]  Number 10, the food I get from eFoods Direct tastes great.
[01:32:10.080 --> 01:32:12.960]  Number nine, the eFoods meals are easy to prepare.
[01:32:12.960 --> 01:32:15.000]  Eight, eFoods Direct delivers the food
[01:32:15.000 --> 01:32:16.280]  right to my front door.
[01:32:16.280 --> 01:32:19.280]  Seven, most of these meals cost less than $2.
[01:32:19.280 --> 01:32:22.360]  Six, with their large variety, I can eat it every day.
[01:32:22.360 --> 01:32:25.200]  Five, I always have access to high quality
[01:32:25.200 --> 01:32:26.320]  delicious food.
[01:32:26.320 --> 01:32:28.800]  Number four, eFoods products don't spoil,
[01:32:28.800 --> 01:32:30.280]  so I never waste any food.
[01:32:30.280 --> 01:32:33.680]  Three, eFoods uses only safe, healthy ingredients.
[01:32:33.680 --> 01:32:36.120]  Number two, I have my own food supply
[01:32:36.120 --> 01:32:37.960]  and don't depend on the grocery store.
[01:32:37.960 --> 01:32:40.960]  And the number one reason I promote eFoods Direct
[01:32:40.960 --> 01:32:44.240]  is they build special offers just for my listeners.
[01:32:44.240 --> 01:32:46.400]  Folks, don't wait, get prepared now.
[01:32:46.400 --> 01:32:48.360]  We all need to be self-sufficient.
[01:32:48.360 --> 01:32:51.840]  Call eFoods Direct at 800-409-5633
[01:32:51.840 --> 01:32:53.440]  and ask for the Alex Jones Special.
[01:32:53.440 --> 01:32:57.040]  Call eFoods Direct at 800-409-5633
[01:32:57.040 --> 01:32:59.680]  or eFoodsDirect.com forward slash Alex.
[01:33:01.600 --> 01:33:05.160]  Coast to coast, direct from Austin.
[01:33:05.160 --> 01:33:08.800]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[01:33:08.800 --> 01:33:09.640]  Network.
[01:33:11.120 --> 01:33:14.120]  ["Eat the Food Direct"]
[01:33:14.120 --> 01:33:19.120]  ["Eat the Food Direct"]
[01:33:19.120 --> 01:33:23.520]  Everybody knows that the days are loaded.
[01:33:23.520 --> 01:33:28.240]  Everybody rolls with their fingers crossed.
[01:33:28.240 --> 01:33:32.280]  Everybody knows the war is over.
[01:33:32.280 --> 01:33:38.600]  On screen, we have a map showing, according to the UN
[01:33:38.600 --> 01:33:42.360]  documents, over half the US off limits to humans.
[01:33:42.360 --> 01:33:44.040]  This is what they want by 2020.
[01:33:44.040 --> 01:33:46.960]  This map is from, what, 1993?
[01:33:46.960 --> 01:33:48.080]  And they are freaking out.
[01:33:48.080 --> 01:33:50.320]  Of course, foreign megacorporations
[01:33:50.320 --> 01:33:52.080]  don't want your county and city and state
[01:33:52.080 --> 01:33:54.360]  having the authority or even your own federal government.
[01:33:54.360 --> 01:33:56.360]  So they've taken over your nation.
[01:33:56.360 --> 01:33:58.200]  Look what's happening in Europe now.
[01:33:58.200 --> 01:34:00.920]  Even Time Magazine says they've been captured and conquered
[01:34:00.920 --> 01:34:04.200]  by Goldman Sachs through fraud.
[01:34:04.200 --> 01:34:05.640]  Instead of going to jail like Bernie Madoff,
[01:34:05.640 --> 01:34:08.000]  they take over the world.
[01:34:08.000 --> 01:34:09.880]  And we're going to have Rosa Corey, who's with us
[01:34:09.880 --> 01:34:12.200]  for the rest of the hour, but this is a shorter show
[01:34:12.200 --> 01:34:14.280]  as a different clock on Sunday.
[01:34:14.280 --> 01:34:16.800]  She's going to be back Thursday for an hour and a half
[01:34:16.800 --> 01:34:18.000]  to go over even more of this.
[01:34:18.000 --> 01:34:20.440]  But I just want to back up everything she's saying.
[01:34:20.440 --> 01:34:23.400]  Now, in Australia and in the US, I've
[01:34:23.400 --> 01:34:27.400]  seen video games they have in public school, even ABC News
[01:34:27.400 --> 01:34:29.840]  covered this, where little animals die.
[01:34:29.840 --> 01:34:32.400]  Bunny rabbits die and get their heads chopped off.
[01:34:32.400 --> 01:34:35.240]  If you breathe, carbon hurts them.
[01:34:35.240 --> 01:34:37.480]  And so the little kids cry and learn to hate themselves
[01:34:37.480 --> 01:34:39.560]  and learn how great suicide is.
[01:34:39.560 --> 01:34:40.880]  I'm not kidding.
[01:34:40.880 --> 01:34:43.280]  But they also show school children in England.
[01:34:43.280 --> 01:34:44.720]  And they have similar videos here.
[01:34:44.720 --> 01:34:46.360]  Well, you saw the video last year where
[01:34:46.360 --> 01:34:47.600]  are you going to cut your carbon footprint?
[01:34:47.600 --> 01:34:48.680]  And the kids say no.
[01:34:48.680 --> 01:34:50.320]  So they blow the kids up in the class.
[01:34:50.320 --> 01:34:51.680]  Remember that?
[01:34:51.680 --> 01:34:55.440]  If you didn't see it, just type in green ads show kids
[01:34:55.440 --> 01:34:57.440]  exploding.
[01:34:57.440 --> 01:34:59.320]  It's all an anti-human agenda.
[01:34:59.320 --> 01:35:03.320]  But here's one of more than 10 videos they show children.
[01:35:03.320 --> 01:35:05.240]  And you think it's a joke, but this is everything
[01:35:05.240 --> 01:35:06.640]  sustainable development does.
[01:35:06.640 --> 01:35:09.360]  This is not a joke made to make them look bad.
[01:35:09.360 --> 01:35:12.560]  This is a video made by London Guardian
[01:35:12.560 --> 01:35:14.200]  and Association of the British Government
[01:35:14.200 --> 01:35:15.360]  for sustainability.
[01:35:15.360 --> 01:35:17.240]  Here it is.
[01:35:17.240 --> 01:35:19.240]  Oh, hi.
[01:35:19.240 --> 01:35:21.520]  I'm so glad you're on time.
[01:35:21.520 --> 01:35:24.000]  I'm V. I'm looking forward to showing you
[01:35:24.000 --> 01:35:26.560]  around Planned Oppolis today.
[01:35:26.560 --> 01:35:28.680]  My husband works from home.
[01:35:28.680 --> 01:35:31.200]  He's a virtual engineer working in one of the city's
[01:35:31.200 --> 01:35:32.880]  desalination plants.
[01:35:32.880 --> 01:35:35.960]  He controls the robots who do all the important maintenance.
[01:35:35.960 --> 01:35:40.920]  I think he basically plays computer games for a living.
[01:35:40.920 --> 01:35:42.240]  You ready to go?
[01:35:42.240 --> 01:35:44.960]  Have you got your calorie card open on your smartphone?
[01:35:44.960 --> 01:35:48.120]  I registered your visit with Slick Travel Corp the other day,
[01:35:48.120 --> 01:35:51.480]  so they've allotted you a journey time to match mine.
[01:35:51.480 --> 01:35:53.720]  It makes so much sense, doesn't it?
[01:35:53.720 --> 01:35:56.760]  Switch off brain and go to work.
[01:35:56.760 --> 01:35:58.760]  With this many people around, I'm glad there's
[01:35:58.760 --> 01:36:01.760]  a mega computer in charge.
[01:36:01.760 --> 01:36:04.880]  We're so lucky our kids were allocated to school quite
[01:36:04.880 --> 01:36:07.280]  early in my practice, so I can drop them off on the way.
[01:36:07.280 --> 01:36:09.040]  It saves on my calorie ration.
[01:36:09.040 --> 01:36:10.560]  Well, it won't be long until the little darlings
[01:36:10.560 --> 01:36:12.320]  get their career announcements.
[01:36:12.320 --> 01:36:14.440]  They've been working so hard, so I'm
[01:36:14.440 --> 01:36:16.320]  sure they'll get something good.
[01:36:16.320 --> 01:36:18.320]  What if there's anything wrong with fixing carbon
[01:36:18.320 --> 01:36:20.640]  scrubbers for a living or anything?
[01:36:20.640 --> 01:36:22.360]  Are you hungry?
[01:36:22.360 --> 01:36:25.160]  Let's pop to the market as we pass.
[01:36:25.160 --> 01:36:28.320]  Right, what's on the menu this month?
[01:36:28.320 --> 01:36:29.760]  No, not meat.
[01:36:29.760 --> 01:36:32.040]  It's not your birthday.
[01:36:32.040 --> 01:36:35.160]  The Global Food Council are doing a really good job
[01:36:35.160 --> 01:36:36.920]  of keeping food production going.
[01:36:36.920 --> 01:36:39.600]  All right, let's stop right there as our guest is here.
[01:36:39.600 --> 01:36:43.480]  There are 20 or 30 I haven't counted of these videos.
[01:36:43.480 --> 01:36:47.640]  And the families aren't allowed to live in single-parent homes.
[01:36:47.640 --> 01:36:48.560]  No meats allowed.
[01:36:48.560 --> 01:36:50.680]  You're not allowed to have a car.
[01:36:50.680 --> 01:36:54.360]  And this is all officially what the UN and our own government
[01:36:54.360 --> 01:36:56.120]  says they're setting up.
[01:36:56.120 --> 01:36:59.080]  You have to understand, people see these videos
[01:36:59.080 --> 01:37:00.120]  and they think this is a joke.
[01:37:00.120 --> 01:37:02.080]  No, this is what they're showing kids.
[01:37:02.080 --> 01:37:04.760]  So you're an adult and have formed your own opinions back
[01:37:04.760 --> 01:37:05.840]  when we were more free.
[01:37:05.840 --> 01:37:07.880]  For a child, they just watch this and think, well,
[01:37:07.880 --> 01:37:09.440]  that's normal.
[01:37:09.440 --> 01:37:12.040]  Just like kids growing up under Hitler thought it was normal.
[01:37:12.040 --> 01:37:14.360]  Or kids under the Aztecs thought cutting people's hearts
[01:37:14.360 --> 01:37:15.280]  out was normal.
[01:37:15.280 --> 01:37:17.160]  Going back to our guest, please continue.
[01:37:17.160 --> 01:37:19.160]  Rosa Corey, author and researcher,
[01:37:19.160 --> 01:37:23.200]  exposing Agenda 21, this total revolution against humanity
[01:37:23.200 --> 01:37:26.680]  by the bureaucratic, tyrant eugenics class.
[01:37:26.680 --> 01:37:29.440]  You said, well, you know what?
[01:37:29.440 --> 01:37:33.120]  The truth is the environmental movement has been hijacked.
[01:37:33.120 --> 01:37:35.760]  And you're seeing this in your schools, for instance,
[01:37:35.760 --> 01:37:38.640]  with outcome-based education.
[01:37:38.640 --> 01:37:41.920]  You'll see asset-based community development.
[01:37:41.920 --> 01:37:43.280]  That's coming your way.
[01:37:43.280 --> 01:37:44.600]  Wait till you see that.
[01:37:44.600 --> 01:37:47.280]  That's a questionnaire that you're going to fill out
[01:37:47.280 --> 01:37:51.760]  that's going to get you to do mandatory volunteering.
[01:37:51.760 --> 01:37:53.760]  Now, last time I thought about that,
[01:37:53.760 --> 01:37:57.760]  mandatory volunteering sounds a lot like slavery to me.
[01:37:57.760 --> 01:38:00.320]  But you see that volunteering is not
[01:38:00.320 --> 01:38:01.880]  going to be volunteering anymore.
[01:38:01.880 --> 01:38:05.240]  You'll be required to volunteer in order
[01:38:05.240 --> 01:38:08.800]  to get your kid into Little League,
[01:38:08.800 --> 01:38:14.000]  to be able to maybe work closer to home, to get your food.
[01:38:14.000 --> 01:38:17.360]  You'll be required in order to be a good citizen.
[01:38:17.360 --> 01:38:19.440]  Oh, Obama has said, to graduate high school,
[01:38:19.440 --> 01:38:20.320]  you'll have to do it.
[01:38:20.320 --> 01:38:22.280]  And it's going to be domestic military.
[01:38:22.280 --> 01:38:24.760]  That's civilian core, yeah.
[01:38:24.760 --> 01:38:26.360]  This is it, exactly.
[01:38:26.360 --> 01:38:27.720]  You don't have to look far.
[01:38:27.720 --> 01:38:29.040]  If you, you know, these are things
[01:38:29.040 --> 01:38:31.520]  that it used to be, well, if you got busted doing something
[01:38:31.520 --> 01:38:33.080]  minor, you were going to pick up trash
[01:38:33.080 --> 01:38:34.000]  by the side of the road.
[01:38:34.000 --> 01:38:36.040]  That's mandatory volunteering.
[01:38:36.040 --> 01:38:38.160]  But now you find that if you're in school,
[01:38:38.160 --> 01:38:40.760]  you want to go to a good school, you're
[01:38:40.760 --> 01:38:45.600]  going to have to do some time working for nonprofits, right?
[01:38:45.600 --> 01:38:47.520]  So who's getting your free time?
[01:38:47.520 --> 01:38:50.640]  Who's getting your time for free for nothing, the nonprofits?
[01:38:50.640 --> 01:38:53.080]  These are public-private partnerships
[01:38:53.080 --> 01:38:56.960]  that you are going to be volunteering mandatory for.
[01:38:56.960 --> 01:38:59.600]  And they're the NGOs competing with the free market,
[01:38:59.600 --> 01:39:02.480]  just like people working for $0.25 an hour in the prisons
[01:39:02.480 --> 01:39:05.080]  are competing and shutting down our society.
[01:39:05.080 --> 01:39:05.480]  Right.
[01:39:05.480 --> 01:39:08.280]  And your tax dollars are going to fund all of this.
[01:39:08.280 --> 01:39:11.200]  You know, this is what happens with, for instance,
[01:39:11.200 --> 01:39:16.200]  redevelopment funds are going to pay for subsidized housing
[01:39:16.200 --> 01:39:18.320]  that is for-profit housing.
[01:39:18.320 --> 01:39:20.760]  So these are developers who are making money
[01:39:20.760 --> 01:39:24.120]  and they're using your property tax dollars to do it.
[01:39:24.120 --> 01:39:26.160]  So this is an entire program.
[01:39:26.160 --> 01:39:27.240]  It's a huge plan.
[01:39:27.240 --> 01:39:30.200]  It's a global plan implemented locally.
[01:39:30.200 --> 01:39:32.920]  And it's using your transportation dollars,
[01:39:32.920 --> 01:39:36.920]  your property tax dollars, your income tax dollars
[01:39:36.920 --> 01:39:38.240]  to make this happen.
[01:39:38.240 --> 01:39:41.080]  And it's all about taking away your independence,
[01:39:41.080 --> 01:39:43.120]  taking away your food independence,
[01:39:43.120 --> 01:39:47.560]  your private property rights, your educational system.
[01:39:47.560 --> 01:39:49.240]  It's a whole life plan.
[01:39:49.240 --> 01:39:51.360]  And it is happening right now.
[01:39:51.360 --> 01:39:52.840]  You don't have to look far.
[01:39:52.840 --> 01:39:54.840]  You can fight it right in your town.
[01:39:54.840 --> 01:39:57.320]  That's where you should fight it, locally,
[01:39:57.320 --> 01:39:59.800]  because that's where these plans are coming up.
[01:39:59.800 --> 01:40:03.160]  You'll find these regional plans right there in your city.
[01:40:03.160 --> 01:40:08.040]  You want to stand up and say, no, we will not be regionalized.
[01:40:08.040 --> 01:40:09.760]  We will not be delfied.
[01:40:09.760 --> 01:40:14.720]  We will not allow our money to go for these plans that
[01:40:14.720 --> 01:40:16.640]  are just going to sink our economy
[01:40:16.640 --> 01:40:20.080]  and drive us further into debt and into foreclosures.
[01:40:20.080 --> 01:40:22.600]  So less of us will own property and we'll
[01:40:22.600 --> 01:40:26.160]  have to move into those high-density developments.
[01:40:26.160 --> 01:40:29.280]  Remember three years ago when the Copenhagen documents came
[01:40:29.280 --> 01:40:31.040]  out and it was designed to reduce population
[01:40:31.040 --> 01:40:33.760]  and shut down the third world, and so it didn't pass?
[01:40:33.760 --> 01:40:36.200]  Schwarzenegger was in USA today, and now he
[01:40:36.200 --> 01:40:37.800]  leads the group for the UN.
[01:40:37.800 --> 01:40:39.040]  He said, don't worry.
[01:40:39.040 --> 01:40:42.160]  We implement at city, county, and state level.
[01:40:42.160 --> 01:40:43.240]  And that's what they're doing.
[01:40:43.240 --> 01:40:46.720]  And they sweep into town, buy off your politicians.
[01:40:46.720 --> 01:40:48.960]  They can buy them so cheap, a couple million
[01:40:48.960 --> 01:40:50.520]  to the National Planning Commission.
[01:40:50.520 --> 01:40:51.400]  And it's over.
[01:40:51.400 --> 01:40:53.640]  They fly them for steak dinners in New York.
[01:40:53.640 --> 01:40:54.880]  It's over.
[01:40:54.880 --> 01:40:56.640]  Or they give their wife or husband a job.
[01:40:56.640 --> 01:40:57.280]  It's over.
[01:40:57.280 --> 01:41:01.600]  And they just literally sign us over to these crooks.
[01:41:01.600 --> 01:41:04.840]  Yeah, well, what they'll do is they actually
[01:41:04.840 --> 01:41:07.360]  develop candidates for office right out
[01:41:07.360 --> 01:41:09.200]  of your neighborhood associations.
[01:41:09.200 --> 01:41:10.320]  They call you.
[01:41:10.320 --> 01:41:14.200]  They bring you in to show buy-in in a local community,
[01:41:14.200 --> 01:41:16.520]  and then they identify the good Germans.
[01:41:16.520 --> 01:41:18.400]  And they move them up the ladder.
[01:41:18.400 --> 01:41:20.720]  We have to call a halt to this.
[01:41:20.720 --> 01:41:23.320]  I don't want people to feel that they are helpless,
[01:41:23.320 --> 01:41:25.040]  that they can't fight this, because we
[01:41:25.040 --> 01:41:28.080]  are fighting it all across the nation, all of us.
[01:41:28.080 --> 01:41:29.960]  Oh, yeah, the globalist to fit the panic button.
[01:41:29.960 --> 01:41:32.240]  Now, I'm not for lying.
[01:41:32.240 --> 01:41:34.960]  But in some cases, when there's election fraud,
[01:41:34.960 --> 01:41:36.560]  there's covert ops.
[01:41:36.560 --> 01:41:38.600]  I think a lot of us should be public.
[01:41:38.600 --> 01:41:41.080]  But I think some people, business folks and others,
[01:41:41.080 --> 01:41:43.520]  should play along with these enemies,
[01:41:43.520 --> 01:41:45.840]  because they are like a foreign power that's infiltrated.
[01:41:45.840 --> 01:41:47.760]  And we should infiltrate their groups
[01:41:47.760 --> 01:41:50.240]  and act like the most hardcore corporate fascist,
[01:41:50.240 --> 01:41:52.240]  laugh at the public, call them scum,
[01:41:52.240 --> 01:41:54.440]  because I've seen the locals do this when they don't know
[01:41:54.440 --> 01:41:55.320]  we're watching.
[01:41:55.320 --> 01:41:57.280]  And they'll actually put you in as mayor,
[01:41:57.280 --> 01:41:58.800]  then you could turn on them.
[01:41:58.800 --> 01:42:00.480]  Do you think that's a good operation?
[01:42:00.480 --> 01:42:01.800]  I don't know.
[01:42:01.800 --> 01:42:04.400]  But I do take their seminars, and I
[01:42:04.400 --> 01:42:06.320]  read all of their documentation.
[01:42:06.320 --> 01:42:09.000]  And this is what you want to do is educate yourself.
[01:42:09.000 --> 01:42:12.240]  Because once people recognize that this is not
[01:42:12.240 --> 01:42:15.400]  a conspiracy theory, it's a fact, and it's happening,
[01:42:15.400 --> 01:42:17.720]  you can get people on board quickly.
[01:42:17.720 --> 01:42:20.040]  And this is happening across the United States.
[01:42:20.040 --> 01:42:22.680]  I'm going all over the US and speaking to groups,
[01:42:22.680 --> 01:42:26.560]  and people are ready and willing to get up and stop this.
[01:42:26.560 --> 01:42:28.240]  And we will win this.
[01:42:28.240 --> 01:42:29.520]  We will win this.
[01:42:29.520 --> 01:42:30.520]  We can do it.
[01:42:30.520 --> 01:42:32.200]  We're going to stop this in our country,
[01:42:32.200 --> 01:42:34.800]  because we can't allow this to continue.
[01:42:34.800 --> 01:42:36.680]  We are losing our rights.
[01:42:36.680 --> 01:42:37.240]  Incredible.
[01:42:37.240 --> 01:42:38.840]  Let's break down how we're winning
[01:42:38.840 --> 01:42:41.800]  and more of what life will look like in the compact cities
[01:42:41.800 --> 01:42:45.000]  and rural areas, how they plan to shut us down.
[01:42:45.000 --> 01:42:46.640]  I want to go over that.
[01:42:46.640 --> 01:42:47.520]  Just amazing.
[01:42:47.520 --> 01:42:48.960]  And I want you to come to Austin,
[01:42:48.960 --> 01:42:50.840]  because as you know, we're under attack.
[01:42:50.840 --> 01:42:53.080]  Maybe we should fly you out here and have you here in studio,
[01:42:53.080 --> 01:42:54.640]  and then have you speak to the locals,
[01:42:54.640 --> 01:42:56.680]  because we've got a great activist community that
[01:42:56.680 --> 01:43:01.280]  loves liberty, because you, Rose, are doing great.
[01:43:01.280 --> 01:43:02.440]  I had tried everything.
[01:43:02.440 --> 01:43:04.800]  I'd cut back the amount of food I was eating.
[01:43:04.800 --> 01:43:07.880]  I was lifting weights and jogging, but nothing was working.
[01:43:07.880 --> 01:43:10.880]  My body was literally starving for minerals and trace
[01:43:10.880 --> 01:43:12.760]  elements, as well as key vitamins.
[01:43:12.760 --> 01:43:15.400]  And as soon as I had that, I immediately
[01:43:15.400 --> 01:43:18.200]  could eat half of what I was eating previously
[01:43:18.200 --> 01:43:19.600]  and be satisfied.
[01:43:19.600 --> 01:43:22.720]  Now, there are hundreds of great products at InfowarsTeam.com,
[01:43:22.720 --> 01:43:24.760]  but I want to point out the three that
[01:43:24.760 --> 01:43:30.800]  have helped me lose 37 pounds in just two months.
[01:43:30.800 --> 01:43:34.320]  Products like Beyond Tangy Tangerine, Pollen Burst,
[01:43:34.320 --> 01:43:35.280]  and Rebound.
[01:43:35.280 --> 01:43:37.760]  When I started taking the Tangy Tangerine and other products
[01:43:37.760 --> 01:43:41.560]  every day, I lost more than 37 pounds in just two months.
[01:43:41.560 --> 01:43:43.080]  Now, that's results.
[01:43:43.080 --> 01:43:47.480]  I want to challenge my listeners to go to InfowarsTeam.com
[01:43:47.480 --> 01:43:49.920]  and to order just three of their products.
[01:43:49.920 --> 01:43:53.080]  And you will see the changes in the way you look, feel,
[01:43:53.080 --> 01:43:55.520]  and in your appetite almost immediately.
[01:43:55.520 --> 01:43:58.120]  Start your journey to health and wellness today.
[01:43:58.120 --> 01:44:01.200]  InfowarsTeam.com.
[01:44:01.200 --> 01:44:05.160]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be
[01:44:05.160 --> 01:44:07.800]  is on the road.
[01:44:07.800 --> 01:44:09.760]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll
[01:44:09.760 --> 01:44:13.000]  be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[01:44:13.000 --> 01:44:17.040]  There's a place down in Tennessee.
[01:44:17.040 --> 01:44:21.680]  Well, they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[01:44:21.680 --> 01:44:27.280]  They so pride in every stitch, guarantee you love the way
[01:44:27.280 --> 01:44:30.080]  they fit.
[01:44:30.080 --> 01:44:33.520]  They put a diamond gusset in the crotch where you need it
[01:44:33.520 --> 01:44:34.760]  most.
[01:44:34.760 --> 01:44:39.840]  Blue diamond gussets got it, others don't.
[01:44:39.840 --> 01:44:43.760]  We turned jeans inside out, diamond gusset jeans,
[01:44:43.760 --> 01:44:46.640]  made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[01:44:46.640 --> 01:44:49.360]  Our Defender Motorcycle Jeans combined gusset comfort
[01:44:49.360 --> 01:44:53.240]  with Kevlar protection so you can ride all day with confidence.
[01:44:53.240 --> 01:44:56.000]  Order yours at gusset.com.
[01:44:56.000 --> 01:44:59.120]  Diamond gusset jeans got it, others don't.
[01:45:01.600 --> 01:45:02.160]  Hi, folks.
[01:45:02.160 --> 01:45:03.280]  This is Alex Jones.
[01:45:03.280 --> 01:45:06.400]  I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings,
[01:45:06.400 --> 01:45:08.520]  opportunity, and recognized risk.
[01:45:08.520 --> 01:45:10.200]  Saving means to make money.
[01:45:10.200 --> 01:45:13.640]  The Calben Pure Soap Company can save you thousands of dollars
[01:45:13.640 --> 01:45:16.040]  and give you good old-fashioned real soaps that
[01:45:16.040 --> 01:45:18.480]  are triple concentrated and twice as good as what you're
[01:45:18.480 --> 01:45:19.600]  using now.
[01:45:19.600 --> 01:45:22.440]  Soaps made from vegetable and coconut oils
[01:45:22.440 --> 01:45:25.800]  that contain no useless dyes, perfumes, deodorants,
[01:45:25.800 --> 01:45:27.240]  or antibacterials.
[01:45:27.240 --> 01:45:30.480]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents
[01:45:30.480 --> 01:45:32.960]  that give you rashes, itching sores,
[01:45:32.960 --> 01:45:35.240]  and a tirerating clothing called lint.
[01:45:35.240 --> 01:45:36.640]  If you want something better, if you
[01:45:36.640 --> 01:45:38.360]  want something you've never had before,
[01:45:38.360 --> 01:45:40.480]  you have to do something you've never done before.
[01:45:40.480 --> 01:45:42.640]  Getting a free catalog is easy by calling
[01:45:42.640 --> 01:45:48.600]  800-340-7091 or see Calben on the web at fivestarsoap.com.
[01:45:48.600 --> 01:45:53.600]  Take charge of your health now by calling 800-340-7091
[01:45:53.600 --> 01:45:56.600]  or see Calben on the web at fivestarsoap.com.
[01:46:00.200 --> 01:46:03.560]  A little over a year ago, I began to do a lot of research
[01:46:03.560 --> 01:46:06.600]  into why, even if I had a pretty good-sized meal that I was
[01:46:06.600 --> 01:46:07.480]  still starving.
[01:46:07.480 --> 01:46:10.000]  And my research led me to a well-known fact
[01:46:10.000 --> 01:46:12.800]  that most of the soils that we grow our crops on here
[01:46:12.800 --> 01:46:15.400]  in the United States and across the industrialized world
[01:46:15.400 --> 01:46:19.680]  are almost completely depleted of almost all of the key minerals
[01:46:19.680 --> 01:46:22.000]  and trace elements that our bodies need
[01:46:22.000 --> 01:46:25.320]  to rebuild themselves, fight off cancer, and be healthy.
[01:46:25.320 --> 01:46:29.120]  I then searched out the best vitamin and mineral company
[01:46:29.120 --> 01:46:31.520]  out there and discovered Young Jevity.
[01:46:31.520 --> 01:46:33.480]  The Young Jevity products are designed
[01:46:33.480 --> 01:46:35.640]  to give you the real nutrition you need.
[01:46:35.640 --> 01:46:37.360]  And once you've got that, you don't
[01:46:37.360 --> 01:46:39.600]  have to eat as much to be satisfied.
[01:46:39.600 --> 01:46:43.960]  I've lost 37 pounds in two months simply getting
[01:46:43.960 --> 01:46:45.960]  the vitamins and minerals I need.
[01:46:45.960 --> 01:46:47.200]  Check it out for yourself.
[01:46:47.200 --> 01:46:48.120]  It's incredible.
[01:46:48.120 --> 01:46:50.800]  Go to infowarseteam.com today and order
[01:46:50.800 --> 01:46:54.360]  your first canister of Beyond Tangy Tangerine Complete
[01:46:54.360 --> 01:46:57.320]  Multivitamin Mineral Complex Dietary Supplement.
[01:46:57.320 --> 01:47:01.640]  That's infowarseteam.com.
[01:47:01.640 --> 01:47:05.240]  Coast to coast, direct from Austin.
[01:47:05.240 --> 01:47:08.800]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[01:47:08.800 --> 01:47:13.200]  We are on the march.
[01:47:13.200 --> 01:47:16.200]  The empire is on the run.
[01:47:16.200 --> 01:47:20.320]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:47:20.320 --> 01:47:23.320]  All right, I'll be back live tomorrow, 11 AM central,
[01:47:23.320 --> 01:47:24.920]  12 noon eastern.
[01:47:24.920 --> 01:47:27.800]  Rosa Cora will be back with us Thursday, Friday, and Thursday
[01:47:27.800 --> 01:47:28.800]  on the show.
[01:47:28.800 --> 01:47:31.800]  We'll be back tomorrow, 11 AM central, 12 noon eastern.
[01:47:31.800 --> 01:47:34.800]  Rosa Cora will be back with us Thursday, Friday, and Thursday
[01:47:34.800 --> 01:47:35.800]  on the show.
[01:47:35.800 --> 01:47:38.800]  We'll be back tomorrow, 11 AM central, 12 noon eastern.
[01:47:38.800 --> 01:47:41.800]  Rosa Cora will be back with us Thursday for an hour and a half
[01:47:41.800 --> 01:47:43.800]  and we've got some longer segments and more time to talk
[01:47:43.800 --> 01:47:44.800]  then.
[01:47:44.800 --> 01:47:46.800]  But again, we've gone over a lot of info here.
[01:47:46.800 --> 01:47:49.800]  We're going to finish out with talking about what you can do
[01:47:49.800 --> 01:47:52.800]  and some more of the things they're doing to rural communities
[01:47:52.800 --> 01:47:53.800]  as well.
[01:47:53.800 --> 01:47:56.800]  Again, we're also going to tell you how to get her book and some
[01:47:56.800 --> 01:47:59.800]  of the websites you can visit to get involved.
[01:47:59.800 --> 01:48:03.800]  But absolutely she is just out there really exposing these
[01:48:03.800 --> 01:48:04.800]  people.
[01:48:04.800 --> 01:48:07.800]  We're hitting the panic button all over the corporate trader
[01:48:07.800 --> 01:48:08.800]  media now.
[01:48:08.800 --> 01:48:11.800]  They're saying, well, the UN is taking over for the earth.
[01:48:11.800 --> 01:48:14.800]  We are increasing your prices and stuff for mega corporations.
[01:48:14.800 --> 01:48:16.800]  Enron and folks set this up.
[01:48:16.800 --> 01:48:18.800]  I mean, it's for the earth.
[01:48:18.800 --> 01:48:20.800]  And of course, I said it was for the earth when Enron was
[01:48:20.800 --> 01:48:24.800]  stealing a billion bucks a week or so a decade ago in California.
[01:48:24.800 --> 01:48:26.800]  But I have a short clip here of Mark Tercik.
[01:48:26.800 --> 01:48:28.800]  Well, first we're going to go to Obama.
[01:48:28.800 --> 01:48:32.800]  Mark Tercik was at the EcoFest put on by the Austin Chronicle
[01:48:32.800 --> 01:48:35.800]  people and he's the head of the Nature Land-Grabbing
[01:48:35.800 --> 01:48:36.800]  Conservancy.
[01:48:36.800 --> 01:48:38.800]  And he agreed to talk to our reporters after a speech.
[01:48:38.800 --> 01:48:41.800]  But when Darren McBreen brought up, well, Obama said he wants
[01:48:41.800 --> 01:48:43.800]  to shut down coal plants.
[01:48:43.800 --> 01:48:44.800]  He said, that's it.
[01:48:44.800 --> 01:48:45.800]  I'm not talking to you.
[01:48:45.800 --> 01:48:47.800]  And literally ran from our reporters.
[01:48:47.800 --> 01:48:48.800]  He ran.
[01:48:48.800 --> 01:48:50.800]  There was a whole press conference there wanting to talk to him.
[01:48:50.800 --> 01:48:51.800]  He heard that question.
[01:48:51.800 --> 01:48:53.800]  It was like a vampire at high noon.
[01:48:53.800 --> 01:48:56.800]  Again, whether you're for coal or not, it's about shutting down
[01:48:56.800 --> 01:48:59.800]  whatever they want and only letting G operate.
[01:48:59.800 --> 01:49:01.800]  Here's the clip of Obama saying we're going to bankrupt coal.
[01:49:01.800 --> 01:49:02.800]  Here it is.
[01:49:02.800 --> 01:49:04.800]  If somebody wants to build a coal-fired plant, they can.
[01:49:04.800 --> 01:49:07.800]  It's just that it will bankrupt them because they're going
[01:49:07.800 --> 01:49:12.800]  to be charged a huge sum for all that greenhouse gas that's
[01:49:12.800 --> 01:49:13.800]  being emitted.
[01:49:13.800 --> 01:49:14.800]  OK.
[01:49:14.800 --> 01:49:15.800]  That's enough there.
[01:49:15.800 --> 01:49:17.800]  We went to another guest asking him a question.
[01:49:17.800 --> 01:49:20.800]  Next, now let's go to Mark Tercik with Darren McBreen
[01:49:20.800 --> 01:49:23.800]  and FullWars.com reporter, simply asking him a question.
[01:49:23.800 --> 01:49:24.800]  And he ran off.
[01:49:24.800 --> 01:49:26.800]  Here it is.
[01:49:26.800 --> 01:49:29.800]  This is, again, Mark Tercik.
[01:49:29.800 --> 01:49:33.800]  He is the head of the Nature Conservancy while they're getting
[01:49:33.800 --> 01:49:36.800]  that queued up there on the system.
[01:49:36.800 --> 01:49:37.800]  All right.
[01:49:37.800 --> 01:49:38.800]  Here it is.
[01:49:38.800 --> 01:49:40.800]  If you will, coal power plants.
[01:49:40.800 --> 01:49:42.800]  I'm just trying to get both sides of the story.
[01:49:42.800 --> 01:49:44.800]  But I want to know if you're familiar with President Obama's
[01:49:44.800 --> 01:49:47.800]  statement that he wanted to bankrupt the coal-fired plant.
[01:49:47.800 --> 01:49:49.800]  I don't think I want to do this, all right.
[01:49:49.800 --> 01:49:50.800]  I'm going to pass.
[01:49:50.800 --> 01:49:51.800]  Thanks.
[01:49:51.800 --> 01:49:53.800]  Yeah, I'm not ready on this topic.
[01:49:53.800 --> 01:49:58.800]  I don't really like the video.
[01:49:58.800 --> 01:49:59.800]  OK.
[01:49:59.800 --> 01:50:01.800]  So there's the clip, a little bit of low audio.
[01:50:01.800 --> 01:50:08.800]  But what do you make of that, Rosa Corey?
[01:50:08.800 --> 01:50:09.800]  Hold on.
[01:50:09.800 --> 01:50:10.800]  We didn't have you fade it up.
[01:50:10.800 --> 01:50:11.800]  Go ahead, Mel.
[01:50:11.800 --> 01:50:12.800]  OK.
[01:50:12.800 --> 01:50:15.800]  When dams are unsustainable and dams have been identified as being
[01:50:15.800 --> 01:50:19.800]  unsustainable, now that is clean power, right?
[01:50:19.800 --> 01:50:21.800]  Hydroelectric power, clean.
[01:50:21.800 --> 01:50:25.800]  But dams are being destroyed all over the United States right now.
[01:50:25.800 --> 01:50:29.800]  Over 1,000 dams have been destroyed in the United States right now
[01:50:29.800 --> 01:50:37.800]  because supposedly it's impossible for living things to survive in a dam area.
[01:50:37.800 --> 01:50:43.800]  So they're freeing these rivers and destroying clean energy at the same time.
[01:50:43.800 --> 01:50:45.800]  This is not an environmental program.
[01:50:45.800 --> 01:50:47.800]  They don't want you using that water.
[01:50:47.800 --> 01:50:52.800]  This is about destroying your opportunity, your ability to be independent.
[01:50:52.800 --> 01:50:54.800]  And they want to bring you into cities.
[01:50:54.800 --> 01:50:55.800]  Why?
[01:50:55.800 --> 01:51:00.800]  Because they want to control you, surveil you, monitor and manipulate you.
[01:51:00.800 --> 01:51:01.800]  And who is doing it?
[01:51:01.800 --> 01:51:03.800]  Your government is doing it.
[01:51:03.800 --> 01:51:07.800]  Your city government, you'll have your National Association of Counties,
[01:51:07.800 --> 01:51:13.800]  your League of Cities, the EPA is a partner, Smart Growth America.
[01:51:13.800 --> 01:51:18.800]  We're kicking Ickley out across the United States at the International Council
[01:51:18.800 --> 01:51:20.800]  on Local Environmental Initiatives.
[01:51:20.800 --> 01:51:26.800]  And we are kicking Ickley out of all of our cities and counties and states across the nation.
[01:51:26.800 --> 01:51:29.800]  And we are taking back our country and our government.
[01:51:29.800 --> 01:51:31.800]  That's what we're doing.
[01:51:31.800 --> 01:51:33.800]  We've got to all do it together.
[01:51:33.800 --> 01:51:39.800]  So when you hear Ickley International Council for Local Environmental Initiatives
[01:51:39.800 --> 01:51:43.800]  or local governments for sustainability, as they call it now,
[01:51:43.800 --> 01:51:48.800]  they are actually actively engaged in changing your local government
[01:51:48.800 --> 01:51:54.800]  so that you'll find your climate adaptation software, your climate protection campaigns.
[01:51:54.800 --> 01:51:56.800]  These are not environmental campaigns.
[01:51:56.800 --> 01:52:02.800]  They are designed to restrict your possibilities and your potential for using your property
[01:52:02.800 --> 01:52:06.800]  and your ability to be free and to speak out freely.
[01:52:06.800 --> 01:52:12.800]  These are all plans designed to destroy the possibility of dissent in our country.
[01:52:12.800 --> 01:52:17.800]  And that is what guarantees our freedom, dissent and the ability to speak and move freely
[01:52:17.800 --> 01:52:19.800]  across our country.
[01:52:19.800 --> 01:52:21.800]  We need to stand up together.
[01:52:21.800 --> 01:52:26.800]  I have about 20 pages in my book of what you can do, and we are doing it across the nation.
[01:52:26.800 --> 01:52:30.800]  And this is Democrats, Republicans, Libertarians.
[01:52:30.800 --> 01:52:34.800]  Everyone's getting up and taking this on together, and we can do it.
[01:52:34.800 --> 01:52:36.800]  Well, we can.
[01:52:36.800 --> 01:52:39.800]  And we had to fader down on the video player earlier,
[01:52:39.800 --> 01:52:42.800]  because we're doing video and audio here for the radio audience
[01:52:42.800 --> 01:52:44.800]  for folks watching at PrismPlanet.tv.
[01:52:44.800 --> 01:52:49.800]  We'll try it again. Here's the Nature Conservancy head who used to work at Goldman Sachs
[01:52:49.800 --> 01:52:51.800]  in helping third-world countries.
[01:52:51.800 --> 01:52:53.800]  Well, you know how much they help them.
[01:52:53.800 --> 01:52:56.800]  In helping Europe, they help us all. They're good people.
[01:52:56.800 --> 01:52:58.800]  Give us your money. It's for the Earth.
[01:52:58.800 --> 01:53:00.800]  Let us triple-charge you. It's for the Earth.
[01:53:00.800 --> 01:53:02.800]  Here he is when he was asked about Obama saying,
[01:53:02.800 --> 01:53:08.800]  well, bankrupt your coal power plants that supply more than half the power to this country.
[01:53:08.800 --> 01:53:12.800]  And here he is refusing to answer the question and running off from the press conference.
[01:53:12.800 --> 01:53:14.800]  Here it is.
[01:53:14.800 --> 01:53:19.800]  These are more for the proponents, I guess, if you will, of coal power plants.
[01:53:19.800 --> 01:53:21.800]  I'm just trying to get both sides of the story.
[01:53:21.800 --> 01:53:24.800]  But I want to know if you're familiar with President Obama's statement
[01:53:24.800 --> 01:53:27.800]  that he wanted to bankrupt the coal power plants.
[01:53:27.800 --> 01:53:30.800]  I'm going to pass. Thanks.
[01:53:30.800 --> 01:53:32.800]  Yeah, I'm not ready on this topic.
[01:53:32.800 --> 01:53:34.800]  I don't really like the video.
[01:53:34.800 --> 01:53:38.800]  All right, we are back live, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:53:38.800 --> 01:53:40.800]  So there you have it.
[01:53:40.800 --> 01:53:42.800]  This is how these people are operating.
[01:53:42.800 --> 01:53:43.800]  It's what they're doing.
[01:53:43.800 --> 01:53:47.800]  Why do you think when he had that brought up to him that he ran?
[01:53:47.800 --> 01:53:49.800]  I mean, they're so used to the trader media,
[01:53:49.800 --> 01:53:52.800]  either being ignorant or not asking real questions.
[01:53:52.800 --> 01:53:54.800]  That's it.
[01:53:54.800 --> 01:53:57.800]  You're inundated with propaganda all over the media.
[01:53:57.800 --> 01:54:01.800]  And when anyone asks a question that deserves to be answered,
[01:54:01.800 --> 01:54:05.800]  and when anyone asks a question that deserves a true answer,
[01:54:05.800 --> 01:54:09.800]  an honest answer, you're just not going to get that.
[01:54:09.800 --> 01:54:13.800]  In fact, right now, you'll be told that, oh, yeah, Agenda 21, right.
[01:54:13.800 --> 01:54:15.800]  Oh, that's a good thing.
[01:54:15.800 --> 01:54:19.800]  Oh, that Agenda 21, because it's coming out now.
[01:54:19.800 --> 01:54:23.800]  Your government used to say that you were a tinfoil hat in that case
[01:54:23.800 --> 01:54:25.800]  if you even talked about it.
[01:54:25.800 --> 01:54:27.800]  But I've got it right here, actually.
[01:54:27.800 --> 01:54:28.800]  Here it is.
[01:54:28.800 --> 01:54:32.800]  This is the United Nations Agenda 21 put out by the UN.
[01:54:32.800 --> 01:54:35.800]  It's 300 pages, 40 chapters.
[01:54:35.800 --> 01:54:37.800]  Well, Rosa, I've read it.
[01:54:37.800 --> 01:54:39.800]  I've got a copy as well, but here's the deal.
[01:54:39.800 --> 01:54:41.800]  They're admitting global government.
[01:54:41.800 --> 01:54:43.800]  They're admitting it's about population reduction.
[01:54:43.800 --> 01:54:45.800]  They're admitting it's to destroy the family.
[01:54:45.800 --> 01:54:48.800]  Germany, as you know, passed a law that all new homes built
[01:54:48.800 --> 01:54:53.800]  have to be dormitory style and no more single family dwellings in Germany.
[01:54:53.800 --> 01:54:55.800]  In fact, folks won't believe that.
[01:54:55.800 --> 01:55:01.800]  They've searched the term Germany, banned single family dwellings.
[01:55:01.800 --> 01:55:05.800]  And then it says by, what, 2015 and then by 2020 totally,
[01:55:05.800 --> 01:55:07.800]  no homes allowed for individuals.
[01:55:07.800 --> 01:55:13.800]  I mean, this is cult brainwashing, Borg, hive mind, body snatcher level,
[01:55:13.800 --> 01:55:17.800]  crazy control freak, commune takeover.
[01:55:17.800 --> 01:55:19.800]  That's right. You said it.
[01:55:19.800 --> 01:55:20.800]  And you know what?
[01:55:20.800 --> 01:55:24.800]  Your president and mine, Obama, committed the United States
[01:55:24.800 --> 01:55:31.800]  to reducing our greenhouse gas emissions 80% below 1990 levels
[01:55:31.800 --> 01:55:33.800]  by the year 2050.
[01:55:33.800 --> 01:55:35.800]  I looked at the charts.
[01:55:35.800 --> 01:55:39.800]  That's going to put us back prior to 1934.
[01:55:39.800 --> 01:55:42.800]  Now, would your country want to create a situation
[01:55:42.800 --> 01:55:45.800]  where your industry and your energy production
[01:55:45.800 --> 01:55:49.800]  is put back before World War II?
[01:55:49.800 --> 01:55:52.800]  And plus, if you look at it in terms of per capita,
[01:55:52.800 --> 01:55:54.800]  you're back to the 1880.
[01:55:54.800 --> 01:55:57.800]  Well, but wait, then they don't even allow real,
[01:55:57.800 --> 01:55:59.800]  sustainable old-fashioned agriculture.
[01:55:59.800 --> 01:56:00.800]  They're harassing that.
[01:56:00.800 --> 01:56:03.800]  They allow the GMO, the toxic waste dumping,
[01:56:03.800 --> 01:56:06.800]  splicing monkeys with eight different species.
[01:56:06.800 --> 01:56:10.800]  You know, they allow all this real stuff that's hurting the environment
[01:56:10.800 --> 01:56:12.800]  while just saying they're going to grab our property
[01:56:12.800 --> 01:56:13.800]  and not let us live our lives.
[01:56:13.800 --> 01:56:15.800]  It is incredible.
[01:56:15.800 --> 01:56:18.800]  That's right. Get yourself into the center of city.
[01:56:18.800 --> 01:56:20.800]  That's what they want you to do so they can watch you,
[01:56:20.800 --> 01:56:23.800]  survey you, control you, take you away from your car
[01:56:23.800 --> 01:56:26.800]  so that you only go where they say you can go.
[01:56:26.800 --> 01:56:28.800]  And on these high-speed trends that don't exist
[01:56:28.800 --> 01:56:30.800]  and go nowhere if they do exist.
[01:56:30.800 --> 01:56:33.800]  And this is your future if you don't stop it now.
[01:56:33.800 --> 01:56:36.800]  We are stopping it now. We can do it.
[01:56:36.800 --> 01:56:38.800]  So, you know, this is what's going to happen.
[01:56:38.800 --> 01:56:40.800]  You lose your food independence,
[01:56:40.800 --> 01:56:43.800]  your ability to speak freely, to move freely,
[01:56:43.800 --> 01:56:45.800]  and you have a country that is mild.
[01:56:45.800 --> 01:56:46.800]  They're already doing it with the TSA.
[01:56:46.800 --> 01:56:48.800]  We're losing $40 billion a year in tourism.
[01:56:48.800 --> 01:56:49.800]  People say, why are they doing it?
[01:56:49.800 --> 01:56:51.800]  They want to bankrupt the airlines.
[01:56:51.800 --> 01:56:54.800]  They admit they want to put taxes on aircraft for carbon tax.
[01:56:54.800 --> 01:56:57.800]  They admit they want to shut down freedom
[01:56:57.800 --> 01:56:59.800]  because that makes us independent.
[01:56:59.800 --> 01:57:00.800]  Incredible.
[01:57:00.800 --> 01:57:02.800]  Folks can find your book.
[01:57:02.800 --> 01:57:06.800]  We have a link to it for Amazon.com and Infowars.com
[01:57:06.800 --> 01:57:08.800]  behind the green mask.
[01:57:08.800 --> 01:57:10.800]  Agenda 21, so important.
[01:57:10.800 --> 01:57:12.800]  I can't wait to have you on this Thursday,
[01:57:12.800 --> 01:57:14.800]  but this isn't hype when you're saying we're starting to win.
[01:57:14.800 --> 01:57:16.800]  As you pointed out, Rosa,
[01:57:16.800 --> 01:57:19.800]  the system says we're winning and are freaking out.
[01:57:19.800 --> 01:57:21.800]  And just like we exposed their carbon tax,
