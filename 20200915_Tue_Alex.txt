[00:00.000 --> 00:17.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is Tuesday, September 15th, the year is 2020.
[00:17.000 --> 00:21.000]  We're 48 days out from the election.
[00:21.000 --> 00:23.000]  I am your host, Alex Jones.
[00:23.000 --> 00:27.000]  We're gonna be live here for the next four hours.
[00:27.000 --> 00:33.000]  The information you're receiving in this broadcast is the most dangerous information in the world
[00:33.000 --> 00:36.000]  for the anti-human forces of Satan.
[00:36.000 --> 00:39.000]  This is not a drill. This is not a permanently. This is not exaggeration.
[00:39.000 --> 00:42.000]  This is the reality that we face.
[00:42.000 --> 00:47.000]  No matter if some of you are doubting this information now in the future, you will see it all unfold.
[00:47.000 --> 00:50.000]  You will be forced to admit there is a God and there is a devil.
[00:50.000 --> 00:52.000]  You will be forced to choose a side.
[00:52.000 --> 00:56.000]  The founder of Black Lives Matter has now come out and admitted that they are Satanists.
[00:56.000 --> 01:00.000]  That's all coming up. But first, this report breaking it down.
[01:00.000 --> 01:02.000]  We're down here.
[01:02.000 --> 01:03.000]  Excuse me?
[01:03.000 --> 01:04.000]  No, we're coming to visit someone.
[01:04.000 --> 01:05.000]  No, you're not.
[01:05.000 --> 01:06.000]  We can't go visit nobody?
[01:06.000 --> 01:10.000]  You can once we confirm who it is, but there's no visitation allowed anyway, so you gotta go.
[01:10.000 --> 01:12.000]  All right, y'all, you see what's happening right here, right?
[01:12.000 --> 01:15.000]  They got these pigs out here.
[01:15.000 --> 01:24.000]  They are telling us that we cannot come in here and see these individuals who's been shot down at the mother f***ing train station.
[01:24.000 --> 01:26.000]  I am so angry at these people.
[01:26.000 --> 01:27.000]  It's beyond angry.
[01:27.000 --> 01:30.000]  I can't believe this is all going on.
[01:30.000 --> 01:31.000]  I know this is a war.
[01:31.000 --> 01:32.000]  I know it's an assault.
[01:32.000 --> 01:37.000]  I know it's 21st century war where they can't militarily attack us front on.
[01:37.000 --> 01:43.000]  So this international crime syndicate, the globalist, are doing it through the culture, through the corruption, through the people.
[01:43.000 --> 01:45.000]  They've manipulated through their economic power.
[01:45.000 --> 01:46.000]  But it's so obvious.
[01:46.000 --> 01:47.000]  It's so admitted.
[01:47.000 --> 01:49.000]  It's so ridiculous.
[01:49.000 --> 01:56.000]  It's just mind blowing at least six cops in the last two days got executed in the United States.
[01:56.000 --> 02:00.000]  Two more got shot in Los Angeles during a fight for their lives.
[02:00.000 --> 02:02.000]  They just aired the police out.
[02:02.000 --> 02:07.000]  They just aired the police out.
[02:07.000 --> 02:13.000]  They got aired out.
[02:13.000 --> 02:15.000]  They just bust on them.
[02:15.000 --> 02:18.000]  That's crazy.
[02:18.000 --> 02:20.000]  Yeah.
[02:20.000 --> 02:23.000]  He goes down in Compton.
[02:23.000 --> 02:31.000]  And it was these people coming to the hospital saying we hope the cops die and just acting like complete maniacs.
[02:31.000 --> 02:33.000]  And I didn't hate them because they were black people.
[02:33.000 --> 02:35.000]  Because there's a bunch of white people acting just like them.
[02:35.000 --> 02:38.000]  I hated them because they're so stupid.
[02:38.000 --> 02:42.000]  You might get 14 black guys killed wrongfully a year by police.
[02:42.000 --> 02:45.000]  And a few hundred black guys shot by police a year.
[02:45.000 --> 02:49.000]  You're twice as likely to be shot of your white per capita.
[02:49.000 --> 02:51.000]  You're the least educated people here.
[02:51.000 --> 02:52.000]  Really?
[02:52.000 --> 02:53.000]  Yes.
[02:53.000 --> 02:54.000]  Yeah.
[02:54.000 --> 02:55.000]  Let's go.
[02:55.000 --> 02:56.000]  Let's do it.
[02:56.000 --> 02:57.000]  Let's dance.
[02:57.000 --> 02:58.000]  All right.
[02:58.000 --> 02:59.000]  All right.
[02:59.000 --> 03:01.000]  Let's talk statistics because black people are being killed by police, right?
[03:01.000 --> 03:02.000]  Yes.
[03:02.000 --> 03:03.000]  What are the numbers?
[03:03.000 --> 03:04.000]  What are the numbers?
[03:04.000 --> 03:05.000]  I don't need to tell you the numbers.
[03:05.000 --> 03:06.000]  I need to.
[03:06.000 --> 03:07.000]  Okay.
[03:07.000 --> 03:08.000]  I need you.
[03:08.000 --> 03:09.000]  You don't know any.
[03:09.000 --> 03:14.000]  Understand your privilege and the fact that your skin color does not get you killed.
[03:14.000 --> 03:15.000]  No.
[03:15.000 --> 03:16.000]  Okay.
[03:16.000 --> 03:18.000]  Can we talk about statistics and numbers and data and facts and evidence?
[03:18.000 --> 03:19.000]  What are the numbers?
[03:19.000 --> 03:20.000]  What are the numbers?
[03:20.000 --> 03:21.000]  Yeah.
[03:21.000 --> 03:22.000]  What are the numbers for you guys?
[03:22.000 --> 03:23.000]  Right.
[03:23.000 --> 03:24.000]  What are the numbers?
[03:24.000 --> 03:25.000]  I'm going to tell you.
[03:25.000 --> 03:28.000]  The number of unarmed black people who were killed by police last year was nine.
[03:28.000 --> 03:34.000]  That's.000022% of the entire black population.
[03:34.000 --> 03:38.000]  The number of white people who were killed by the unarmed white people killed by the police
[03:38.000 --> 03:40.000]  last year was 19.
[03:40.000 --> 03:41.000]  19.
[03:41.000 --> 03:46.000]  So, and the number of white people who are killed by police every year is double the
[03:46.000 --> 03:48.000]  amount that's killed by black people.
[03:48.000 --> 03:49.000]  You're literally disgusting.
[03:49.000 --> 03:53.000]  Because the facts that I'm giving you don't align with your cult narrative.
[03:53.000 --> 03:55.000]  What is it about me that disgusts you?
[03:55.000 --> 03:57.000]  You're angry because I told you facts.
[03:57.000 --> 03:59.000]  You're f*****g privileged.
[03:59.000 --> 04:02.000]  Black people are not being killed by police and just f*****g numbers.
[04:02.000 --> 04:03.000]  It's not happening.
[04:03.000 --> 04:06.000]  You're just full of rage for no reason.
[04:06.000 --> 04:09.000]  More than half of the black babies in New York City are aborted.
[04:09.000 --> 04:10.000]  More than half.
[04:10.000 --> 04:12.000]  You care about those black lives.
[04:12.000 --> 04:14.000]  Because I don't want you to try to incite anger.
[04:14.000 --> 04:15.000]  Learn some facts.
[04:15.000 --> 04:16.000]  You don't have to be so angry.
[04:16.000 --> 04:17.000]  Oh, no.
[04:17.000 --> 04:19.000]  Oh, no.
[04:19.000 --> 04:21.000]  It's not just there's more white people.
[04:21.000 --> 04:24.000]  If you're a white man, you're twice as likely to be shot by the police because the police
[04:24.000 --> 04:27.000]  aren't scared to shoot you if you pull a gun on them.
[04:27.000 --> 04:28.000]  And cops aren't perfect.
[04:28.000 --> 04:29.000]  There's certainly some bad ones.
[04:29.000 --> 04:35.000]  But I'm watching these black dudes with BLM go to the hospital and there's like hours
[04:35.000 --> 04:42.000]  of this footage, daring cops to shoot them, screaming, hoping the police die.
[04:42.000 --> 04:46.000]  Because they think there's an epidemic of black people being killed by police.
[04:46.000 --> 05:13.000]  This is Mind Control, ladies and gentlemen.
[05:13.000 --> 05:38.000]  This is Mind Control, ladies and gentlemen.
[05:38.000 --> 05:58.000]  This is Mind Control.
[06:09.000 --> 06:37.000]  Live, raw and unfiltered, it's the Alex Jones show.
[06:37.000 --> 06:46.000]  It's September 15th on this Tuesday Global Edition, 48 days out.
[06:46.000 --> 06:49.000]  I am your host, Alex Jones, very honored, very blessed to be here.
[06:49.000 --> 06:54.000]  Well, thank you all for being listeners and viewers and supporters because without you,
[06:54.000 --> 06:59.000]  the enemy would have destroyed us and this country along with the rest of us.
[06:59.000 --> 07:00.000]  Yes, it's a fact.
[07:00.000 --> 07:08.000]  Without info wars, the entire global landscape of understanding how the world really works
[07:08.000 --> 07:09.000]  would not have happened.
[07:09.000 --> 07:11.000]  We would not have President Trump.
[07:11.000 --> 07:13.000]  We would not have Bolsonaro.
[07:13.000 --> 07:17.000]  We would not have Nigel Farage.
[07:17.000 --> 07:19.000]  We would not have all these people in those positions.
[07:19.000 --> 07:21.000]  I've been told by Bolsonaro's son.
[07:21.000 --> 07:26.000]  This is right hand man, a member of Congress in Brazil face to face.
[07:26.000 --> 07:30.000]  I've been told by Nigel Farage on this show.
[07:30.000 --> 07:40.000]  I've been told by Donald Trump that they know info wars is what ignited the global awakening.
[07:40.000 --> 07:42.000]  It was already there.
[07:42.000 --> 07:44.000]  The Patriots already knew what was going on.
[07:44.000 --> 07:50.000]  The John Birch Society, Barry Goldwater, Ron Paul, who came along later.
[07:50.000 --> 07:57.000]  But we supercharged this audience and everyone that helped promote info wars material like
[07:57.000 --> 08:00.000]  Drudge did for 15 years, changed the whole face of the world.
[08:00.000 --> 08:07.000]  That's why it's hard to get mad at Drudge, who's obviously supporting the other team.
[08:07.000 --> 08:10.000]  When he helped get us to this point, I haven't talked to Drudge in years.
[08:10.000 --> 08:14.000]  I don't know what Drudge is up to or why Drudge is doing that.
[08:14.000 --> 08:23.000]  That's why I'm nothing but support for Drudge because, again, just giving credit where credit's due.
[08:23.000 --> 08:26.000]  Paul Watts has got a big video out on him saying what the hell happened to him.
[08:26.000 --> 08:27.000]  It's a good question.
[08:27.000 --> 08:32.000]  In fact, I'm going to play it later today and talk about that, but that's a side issue.
[08:32.000 --> 08:34.000]  Info wars changed the world.
[08:34.000 --> 08:41.000]  It's our job not to be popular up front, but to have the courage to cover the things that we know we'll be attacked for
[08:41.000 --> 08:50.000]  because we know it's true to break the ice and make it safe for other people like Glenn Beck and Sean Hannity
[08:50.000 --> 08:58.000]  and Tucker Carlson to come along and adopt our world view, which is the accurate world view.
[08:58.000 --> 09:06.000]  The Globalist Program has put out thousands of different flavors of disinfo and then hope you never read their white papers.
[09:06.000 --> 09:09.000]  Well, I read the white papers.
[09:09.000 --> 09:13.000]  I read hundreds and hundreds of books by the Globalist for the Globalist.
[09:13.000 --> 09:14.000]  I infiltrated their organizations.
[09:14.000 --> 09:19.000]  I interviewed all the major defectors against them and we are the brain trust.
[09:19.000 --> 09:20.000]  You are the brain trust.
[09:20.000 --> 09:22.000]  You did it.
[09:22.000 --> 09:24.000]  We're winning.
[09:24.000 --> 09:32.000]  The new order is in big trouble, but the system is created of corruption and surveillance and evil is growing like a cancer.
[09:32.000 --> 09:38.000]  But the people that thought they'd build this world government and have it take over, they are in deep trouble.
[09:38.000 --> 09:46.000]  That doesn't mean the system they built is in deep trouble, but that's the next phase of what we're going to do and we will do it and we will be successful.
[09:46.000 --> 09:56.000]  Just like George Herbert Walker Bush said in 1992 that he was going to bring us into one world government because when we are successful and we will be,
[09:56.000 --> 09:58.000]  we're going to establish our new world order.
[09:58.000 --> 10:07.000]  Well, you can see the new world order coming into view where nation states and people have no power and mega corporations are above the law and totally evil.
[10:07.000 --> 10:11.000]  So let me tell you what's in the stack today.
[10:11.000 --> 10:16.000]  I just called and I said, let's get this Paul Watson next to it Wednesday or Thursday this week.
[10:16.000 --> 10:29.000]  Let's get Bishop Larry Gators on because he's been exposing LeBron James and that the founders of Black Lives Matter and all them are actually into an anti-African cult that feeds off the energy of black people.
[10:29.000 --> 10:43.000]  Now, I know the globalists do that for my own studies, but everything he said about Black Lives Matter, the founder has now come out and said that killing police is a form of sacrifice to the devil.
[10:43.000 --> 10:47.000]  It's a big gateway pundit article and I'm glad they went and dug these quotes out.
[10:47.000 --> 10:55.000]  These people are not hiding this about how they pray to these gods and that it's all black magic.
[10:55.000 --> 11:06.000]  The spirits want murder.
[11:06.000 --> 11:13.000]  So when we say it's a spiritual battle, it is these women, these Marxist who tell you we don't want men to have testicles.
[11:13.000 --> 11:15.000]  We don't want to have a black family.
[11:15.000 --> 11:22.000]  How could you say you're a bigger enemy of humans or black people didn't say we are here to destroy the family?
[11:22.000 --> 11:29.000]  That is their maxim and the greatest sacrament is a man having his testicles cut off.
[11:29.000 --> 11:31.000]  Talk about witches.
[11:31.000 --> 11:37.000]  Talk about devils.
[11:37.000 --> 11:47.000]  You know, a great historian and Vietnam highly decorated veteran Oliver Stone wrote Conan the Barbarian, the first Conan movie, the second one was Unwatchable Crap.
[11:47.000 --> 11:52.000]  The first one is excellent, the lot of ancient lore mixed together with fiction.
[11:52.000 --> 12:06.000]  And in it, Conan is wanting to find out who killed his family and he comes into this lady's house in the mountains and she says, I'll tell you where those snakes eating snakes came from.
[12:06.000 --> 12:10.000]  I'll tell you where that amulet came from, but there is a price barbarian.
[12:10.000 --> 12:12.000]  And what does she want to do?
[12:12.000 --> 12:19.000]  She wants to take his sexual energy and a sexual ritual and kill him while she's raping him.
[12:19.000 --> 12:22.000]  This is Alistair Crowley magic.
[12:22.000 --> 12:24.000]  And that's what these women are involved in.
[12:24.000 --> 12:26.000]  These are real black magic witches.
[12:26.000 --> 12:29.000]  And I don't mean black magic because they're black.
[12:29.000 --> 12:34.000]  I mean, they are some devils and they admit it.
[12:34.000 --> 12:46.000]  And you look at the spell they've got over people that have taken on this, just murder the police, murder innocent people, shoot people at checkpoints, burn things down, go into restaurants and attack people because of what color they are.
[12:46.000 --> 12:55.000]  And these women conducting their little white magic rituals out in the open like of Rina Baranovich does, but then the black magic is done internally.
[12:55.000 --> 12:59.000]  I mean, these are just arrogant, slob-like jokes.
[12:59.000 --> 13:11.000]  But they've got the power of Soros, who is a dark magician of the highest order behind them.
[13:11.000 --> 13:12.000]  And Alexander Soros.
[13:12.000 --> 13:15.000]  And we're going to talk about that when we come back.
[13:15.000 --> 13:20.000]  Why the Justice Department's leaked emails that Antifa's organized.
[13:20.000 --> 13:23.000]  Remember, they had blackmailed Edgar Hoover, reportedly.
[13:23.000 --> 13:27.000]  LaCosta Nostra had the Italian mafia.
[13:27.000 --> 13:31.000]  And up until the fifties, they said there's no such thing as organized crime.
[13:31.000 --> 13:32.000]  It doesn't exist.
[13:32.000 --> 13:34.000]  Well, it's the same thing here.
[13:34.000 --> 13:42.000]  Oh, the FBI still run by leftists at the highest levels in some areas, not completely, but part of it says white supremacy, the biggest threat, right?
[13:42.000 --> 13:43.000]  Biggest killer, sure.
[13:43.000 --> 13:45.000]  So is the Easter Bunny.
[13:45.000 --> 13:50.000]  But they say they don't know who runs Antifa though.
[13:50.000 --> 13:54.000]  Really, I have their corporate mylaws and their minutes and all of it right here.
[13:54.000 --> 13:56.000]  I'll be showing everybody.
[13:56.000 --> 14:02.000]  They've got full page ads and newspapers across the country for millions of dollars of a pop.
[14:02.000 --> 14:05.000]  It's $200,000 for the ad they bought the New York Times.
[14:05.000 --> 14:07.000]  They bought them in major papers across the country.
[14:07.000 --> 14:09.000]  Millions of dollars.
[14:09.000 --> 14:10.000]  And they're highly financed.
[14:10.000 --> 14:12.000]  We'll show you exactly who runs them.
[14:12.000 --> 14:18.000]  And the same dude just gave $220 million on top of all the other hundreds of millions to what?
[14:18.000 --> 14:21.000]  Black lives matter.
[14:21.000 --> 14:23.000]  Black lives matter.
[14:23.000 --> 14:30.000]  And then 98% of the money is siphoned off to the Democratic Party and all the old white people.
[14:30.000 --> 14:48.000]  And then you've got obese, insane witches strutting around doing rituals being worshipped by men when that women are coming archetypally to destroy their masculine energy to feed on the species and enslave humanity.
[14:48.000 --> 14:52.000]  They come for the men.
[14:52.000 --> 15:03.000]  I mean, just thank God every moment that you are not a demonic slob like this lady dressed up as a black winged angel.
[15:03.000 --> 15:14.000]  We'll play the video coming up, but Pastor Bishop Gators will be joining us in the fourth hour today.
[15:14.000 --> 15:16.000]  He certainly is an expert on this.
[15:16.000 --> 15:20.000]  And just like me, when you have a lot of info, you tend to move fast.
[15:20.000 --> 15:26.000]  I'm going to ask him today to really drill into the occult areas of this and really take his time because I know a lot of the stuff he knows.
[15:26.000 --> 15:29.000]  I know he's not Bessing, but he's moving so quick when I'm watching.
[15:29.000 --> 15:36.000]  He explains all the languages that these globalists use and how it's all their gang language that we don't know.
[15:36.000 --> 15:37.000]  And he's dead on.
[15:37.000 --> 15:41.000]  So you can know where they're coming from and what they think their source of power is.
[15:41.000 --> 15:48.000]  And it's in blood killing babies when they're not born, killing them when they're born, killing old people, killing cops.
[15:48.000 --> 15:53.000]  And to kill a warrior and to kill someone that defends the tribe, that's the highest level of sacrifice you can get.
[15:53.000 --> 15:57.000]  The Druids did it with the Burning Man, where they would burn the pure warriors.
[15:57.000 --> 16:01.000]  The trick that social engineers use is very, very simple.
[16:01.000 --> 16:13.000]  They just teach us that the architecture of civilization, that the trajectory of a species is designed by these ever-knowing, loving, liberal technocrats.
[16:13.000 --> 16:19.000]  And that if we just sit back and enjoy the ride, everything will be great, but then they tell us that humans are obsolete, not essential,
[16:19.000 --> 16:22.000]  and we're bad for the earth and we need to be phased out.
[16:22.000 --> 16:32.000]  So they're very open about what they're doing and they count on us just being very passive living in the matrix-like system that they're building.
[16:32.000 --> 16:40.000]  But what defines humans more than anything from the rest of the, quote, animal kingdom is that we control our environment.
[16:40.000 --> 16:49.000]  We build our own environments, we create our own systems, we really geo-engineer and terraform the planet and its systems towards our aims.
[16:49.000 --> 16:56.000]  But instead, we're acting like animals, and the globalists play the part of humans and us as cattle. And that's the trick.
[16:56.000 --> 17:04.000]  It was a sleeper product. It wasn't popular at first, but as people tried it, it's become one of our top five best sellers.
[17:04.000 --> 17:14.000]  We're talking about the 8-pack power stack. 13 different pills filled with super nutrients, vitamins, minerals, and more that you take in the morning and one pack and at night.
[17:14.000 --> 17:22.000]  It's available right now at 60% off for a limited time when you get it with Survival Shield X2 that's now back in stock.
[17:22.000 --> 17:25.000]  This has changed my life and so many other people's lives.
[17:25.000 --> 17:33.000]  Now here's the problem. Some of the patented ingredients that are in 8-pack power stack because of the shutdown and the lockdown are not available for us to even reorder it.
[17:33.000 --> 17:38.000]  So this could be the last shipment that we ever have. It's in stock now.
[17:38.000 --> 17:48.000]  Take advantage of this new combo special. Part of a larger sell we have and free shipping on these sell items like 8-pack power stack and X2 at infowarstore.com.
[17:48.000 --> 18:07.000]  Take advantage and get 8-pack power stack with X2. 60% off and free shipping. Biggest deal on this ever.
[18:18.000 --> 18:32.000]  Forty-eight days. Forty-eight days racing towards us with agonizing slowness.
[18:32.000 --> 18:39.000]  There's that paradox that the time is flying by but each second is like a year.
[18:39.000 --> 18:49.000]  That is the paradox of the universe. I am your host, Alex Jones, on this live Tuesday, Toma Promptor Free, Global Transmission.
[18:49.000 --> 18:55.000]  All right, so we've got a lot of incredible COVID world government news we're going to be getting to.
[18:55.000 --> 19:03.000]  We've also got the globalist next frontier of censorship. We're going to be exposing and how easy it is to defeat this fraud.
[19:03.000 --> 19:10.000]  But first, let's get into who exactly is behind Antifa.
[19:10.000 --> 19:19.000]  Now, that's kind of a joke to have the feds leak that, oh, we've discovered it's orchestrated and run by someone.
[19:19.000 --> 19:26.000]  Now, they get patsies to come and do more of the violent stuff and pay them cash. It's compartmentalized, but we know they're getting centralized directives.
[19:26.000 --> 19:36.000]  Well, that's funny because the Chinese government through the Maoist institutes and places like the University of Texas fund them.
[19:36.000 --> 19:44.000]  And the refused fascism, which is a Maoist group with weathermen involved that also gets Soros money is controlling it.
[19:44.000 --> 19:51.000]  And all of this can be looked up. And so just let me do the FBI's job for them as if they don't know every damn bit of this and more.
[19:51.000 --> 20:02.000]  Meet, refuse fascism, the domestic Maoist group endorsing Joe Biden. That's out of justice news. Just the news continuing.
[20:02.000 --> 20:12.000]  No surprise. The transition integrity project is working to remove President Trump from office no matter what has connections to China, Soros, Obama and Hunter Biden.
[20:12.000 --> 20:19.000]  And Gateway pundit, a big lengthy article, details all the funding of the groups, including a foreign government.
[20:19.000 --> 20:26.000]  I remember I told you three years ago, four years ago, this is for now, we infiltrated anti for awesome undercover people.
[20:26.000 --> 20:34.000]  And they were meeting at UT with a UT board member running it, who's on the payroll of China and a Confucius Institute.
[20:34.000 --> 20:37.000]  And they were pledging allegiance to Xi Jinping.
[20:37.000 --> 20:43.000]  And when we were there, we later got approached by the military and the CIA.
[20:43.000 --> 20:48.000]  And they said, Hey, we know you're infiltrating these groups are very dangerous. We're aware of it. We're in there as well.
[20:48.000 --> 20:54.000]  I'm like, Well, you sure as hell ought to be doing something about it. Because this was like whole meeting rooms with hundreds of people at UT.
[20:54.000 --> 21:00.000]  Okay. And when we had to have a pass a code word to get in, we got in.
[21:00.000 --> 21:03.000]  Okay. And I told you about that four years ago.
[21:03.000 --> 21:09.000]  So now you've seen they've shut down the Confucius Institute. These are foreign paid operatives. Let's continue.
[21:09.000 --> 21:19.000]  I mean, refuse fascism, the domestic malice group endorsing Joe Biden. No surprise, the transition integrity project is working to remove President Trump from office.
[21:19.000 --> 21:23.000]  No matter what has connections to China, Soros, Obama and Hunter Biden.
[21:23.000 --> 21:32.000]  DHS has overwhelming intel that Portland violence organized by violent antiva anarchist leaked emails.
[21:32.000 --> 21:39.000]  And it goes into CBS News reporting that the feds say that it's organized. Really? Really?
[21:39.000 --> 21:48.000]  Meanwhile, the billionaire backers of insurrection, the transition integrity project, big article out of American greatness.
[21:48.000 --> 21:54.000]  And it links to all the facts and how Soros funds it and how he gave hundreds of millions of dollars to the groups that fund it.
[21:54.000 --> 21:57.000]  And it's all right there. This is all open and shut. It's not even hidden.
[21:57.000 --> 22:01.000]  Breaking DHS leaked email confirms anti frozen organized group. Wow.
[22:01.000 --> 22:06.000]  They confirm that cows walk on four legs.
[22:06.000 --> 22:11.000]  Then we have the New York Times defending them. Trump's shredding of similarities won't stop with antifa.
[22:11.000 --> 22:18.000]  They go on to say that the man that reportedly shot the other patriot prayer person probably wouldn't even do it.
[22:18.000 --> 22:23.000]  He's just a suspect and the police probably killed him on purpose and he's a hero.
[22:23.000 --> 22:28.000]  Meanwhile, the guy said he killed him and admits he killed him. It's just the New York Times.
[22:28.000 --> 22:35.000]  Breaking CDC defies Trump executive order moves forward with critical race theory indoctrination.
[22:35.000 --> 22:40.000]  Now, why is this important? Because it's an example of why Trump can't get anything done.
[22:40.000 --> 22:44.000]  The bureaucracies and the agencies do not do what he lawfully says.
[22:44.000 --> 22:55.000]  So they're going to go ahead with a multi month long brainwashing 13 week series titled naming, measuring and addressing the impacts of racism.
[22:55.000 --> 23:00.000]  And it goes on to say America's bad. America's racist. America's evil. Go read it for yourself.
[23:00.000 --> 23:05.000]  It actually says the country should not exist.
[23:05.000 --> 23:08.000]  It's unbelievable.
[23:08.000 --> 23:13.000]  It's a good article in Town Hall that breaks this down. Democrats are trying to threaten their way into power. Exactly.
[23:13.000 --> 23:21.000]  Meanwhile, they've elected all these former weathermen people and their children to be district attorneys around the country.
[23:21.000 --> 23:25.000]  So let me again show you who they are. FBI. Let me show everybody who they are.
[23:25.000 --> 23:34.000]  The nightmare must end. The Trump pinch regime must go November 4th. It begins.
[23:34.000 --> 23:39.000]  And it has refused fascism right here and who they are and what they do refuse fascism.org.
[23:39.000 --> 23:46.000]  And that is the original group that founded Antifa more than 30 years ago and then set up refuse fascism.
[23:46.000 --> 23:54.000]  In 2016 as their new super PAC. But that's the group. That's the organization. That's the people.
[23:54.000 --> 24:02.000]  You know, read all about it. Refuse fascism is a radical Maoist group with funding from China and Confucius organizations.
[24:02.000 --> 24:06.000]  Read the kid Daniels article full page. New York Times ad demands anti revolution.
[24:06.000 --> 24:17.000]  Here is the executive action summaries from Alexander Soros with their command groups trying to trigger martial law riots in Maryland.
[24:17.000 --> 24:23.000]  So you want to know what's going on here it is right here. Okay, I could go on for hours about this.
[24:23.000 --> 24:34.000]  But let's talk about the aftermath. You've got big tech saying you're not allowed to report on now more than 50 arrest on the West Coast for arson.
[24:34.000 --> 24:44.000]  Catching people in the act with mall off cocktails gasoline matches on people's property on highways in vineyards running around setting fires on surveillance camera.
[24:44.000 --> 24:53.000]  The police see it and when the police report arson, the police are being put on administrative leave because you are not allowed to talk about this.
[24:53.000 --> 24:59.000]  So leftist are involved in the revolution. They are burning the West Coast down. They're trying to bankrupt the country.
[24:59.000 --> 25:10.000]  It's clower and pivot on steroids. Let's go ahead and play the clip. Oregon woman catches arsonist on her property with black hands from all the stuff he's been lighting with matches in his hand in the act.
[25:10.000 --> 25:12.000]  She has a firearm. Here it is.
[25:12.000 --> 25:24.000]  Get out the floor. Get out the floor right now. Take down. What are you doing in my property?
[25:24.000 --> 25:32.000]  Passing through. I didn't know the property. Did you light anything on fire? No, ma'am. What are you doing with those matches on your head?
[25:32.000 --> 25:35.000]  I smoke. You smoke? Where are you?
[25:35.000 --> 25:41.000]  We don't want to have matches right now. Did you light anything up on fire? No.
[25:41.000 --> 25:46.000]  What's your name? Corey Allen.
[25:46.000 --> 25:48.000]  They're catching people everywhere.
[25:48.000 --> 25:54.000]  The cops coming.
[25:54.000 --> 25:57.000]  It's an army of homeless zombies. They're being paid.
[25:57.000 --> 26:03.000]  He's got matches on his hand. Make sure he's not pictures of him.
[26:03.000 --> 26:09.000]  All right. Let's go to the next video. Here is another area of Oregon.
[26:09.000 --> 26:17.000]  There are a bunch of other videos where they caught him in California actually lighting the fires. Here's the video.
[26:17.000 --> 26:28.000]  This is 10.46 a.m. Here comes the Zombo. It starts lighting fires like a good little leftist and they're just doing it everywhere.
[26:28.000 --> 26:32.000]  They did a test run of this like eight years ago in Austin.
[26:32.000 --> 26:38.000]  And he sets the fire. Now, if you try to put this on Facebook or anywhere else, it is deleted. It does not exist.
[26:38.000 --> 26:43.000]  Okay? They are under the control of communist China. America is fighting for its life.
[26:43.000 --> 26:49.000]  This is a war against our entire country and their method zombie forces are launching attacks.
[26:49.000 --> 27:14.000]  Citizens, keep your eyes peeled. Defend the Republic. We'll be right back. Stay with us.

[27:50.000 --> 28:13.000]  Remember 15 days to flatten the curve because the hospitals were so full. Of course, all that was a lie. All that was a fraud.
[28:13.000 --> 28:27.000]  If you put up with it, this is the rollout of the post-human world. I know you know that, but I've seen National Democrat Party statements that I've seen CNN and others point out that Jones says that COVID is a hoax.
[28:27.000 --> 28:41.000]  What I'm saying is it's an overblown fraud. It's a scam. But he sells InfoWarshot.com masks. Yes, if you're going to be made to do it to fly on an airport or by the police on a train, then fight back with information warfare, have a walking billboard.
[28:41.000 --> 28:49.000]  That's hypocrisy to be able to hold two different ideas in your head at the same time. If you're going to be raped by these people, they're going to put the burqa over your head.
[28:49.000 --> 29:17.000]  Might as well advertise it with InfoWarshot.com. It's that simple, ladies and gentlemen. Fight back.
[29:17.000 --> 29:25.000]  If you just scratch the surface, they're so arrogant, they've all written detailed blueprints of this plan, and more and more being honest about it.
[29:25.000 --> 29:32.000]  Because there comes a point where, as David Icke says, they have to stop hiding it and start selling it.
[29:32.000 --> 29:44.000]  So we're at the point of the emergence now, and it's coming out in the open. And some people under Mass.com syndrome are going to submit to any level of tyranny that others are going to fight.
[29:44.000 --> 29:54.000]  This isn't like some old dictatorship that you could submit to it and join it be okay. No. This thing is post-human and exterminism. Research what that is.
[30:14.000 --> 30:28.000]  Spyless from the start. Sucked into the heart.
[30:28.000 --> 30:39.000]  Joe Biden plays the lead part. Remember seeing in about three weeks ago came out and said, don't worry, Biden's going to step down and Kamala Harris or somebody else will be president.
[30:39.000 --> 30:52.000]  Pelosi's been saying she's going to be president. This is like something right out of a Greek tragedy or something. All these crazy people battling for power that they can't even understand or wield.
[30:52.000 --> 31:03.000]  It's all coming up, but I want to talk in a moment about the next phase of censorship and control and the sleight of hand that's going on that's based on sleight of hand itself.
[31:03.000 --> 31:09.000]  But let's continue along with what's unfolding.
[31:09.000 --> 31:34.000]  You saw a few days ago the sheriff's deputies Saturday both shot in the head in LA. One woman who'd been a librarian previously but saw society breaking down became an officer.
[31:34.000 --> 31:44.000]  The job basically blown off hanging. You see the shocking still shot from surveillance footage right there.
[31:44.000 --> 31:54.000]  For having a upper blue collar job that pays $50,000 a year and all the hate that comes with it being called to all the dangerous bars and businesses and home disturbances.
[31:54.000 --> 32:00.000]  That's what you get is shot in the face for it.
[32:00.000 --> 32:10.000]  So many videos of this and I noticed that watching these made me over the weekend the last few days have blow up and be a jerk to my wife and a jerk to the crew.
[32:10.000 --> 32:20.000]  Because just seeing the media praise this and see the media defending it and seeing all the videos of Black Lives Matter, celebrating it physically makes me angry.
[32:20.000 --> 32:24.000]  Because this is the death of logic. This is extremely evil.
[32:24.000 --> 32:29.000]  And this is an attempt to overthrow local government to not get rid of police but bring in globalist police.
[32:29.000 --> 32:39.000]  Terrorism. Terrorism is carrying out violence or threatening violence to make someone accept your political or economic demands.
[32:39.000 --> 32:44.000]  And we're being told by the Democrats, you do what we want or we're going to burn the country down and start killing everybody.
[32:44.000 --> 32:58.000]  And because Pelosi and Michael Moore and Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama and Eric Holder and Big Mike and George Soros and all these other people never pay for attacking us.
[32:58.000 --> 33:03.000]  They get more and more bold.
[33:03.000 --> 33:16.000]  I think they'd wipe 34 phones and devices from the Mueller witch hunt when it's a felony, 20 years in prison each time because they are pissing in our faces because they're criminals.
[33:16.000 --> 33:20.000]  And they think we're weak.
[33:20.000 --> 33:29.000]  And behind the scenes they've got the whole president's family under criminal investigation, both state and federal and almost all of his top supporters.
[33:29.000 --> 33:33.000]  And most people roll over under that.
[33:33.000 --> 33:37.000]  So these criminals have never even had a bloody nose.
[33:37.000 --> 33:43.000]  Much less politically, their teeth knocked out.
[33:43.000 --> 33:56.000]  And so they got that walking hubris of a fool, of a clown, right before it steps into oblivion.
[33:56.000 --> 34:03.000]  But the fall of Colossus Clowns tends to take a lot of civilization with it.
[34:03.000 --> 34:07.000]  So this is a harbinger of destruction.
[34:07.000 --> 34:11.000]  We're on the eve of destruction. Make no mistake.
[34:11.000 --> 34:31.000]  The sins we've committed will be dealt with by God and all the disasters and all the corruption, all the pedophilia and all the Satanism coming out in the open, climbing out of their holes, swithering out of their nest.
[34:31.000 --> 34:40.000]  He's only a prelude because their writhing death rattles
[34:40.000 --> 34:45.000]  are going to be spectacular.
[34:45.000 --> 34:49.000]  And many of us will be drugged down with them.
[34:49.000 --> 34:55.000]  Like Captain Ahab and the Great White Whale.
[34:55.000 --> 34:59.000]  Moby Dick.
[34:59.000 --> 35:21.000]  So let's play just one of the many videos of someone who witnessed the two police being shot in the head for no reason, celebrating with satanic delight that the founders of Black Lives Matter say that murder is what the spirits want, a blood offering.
[35:21.000 --> 35:25.000]  And the spirit is flowing.
[35:25.000 --> 35:28.000]  The force of Satanism is with them.
[35:28.000 --> 35:30.000]  And this is what we're going to use.
[35:30.000 --> 35:32.000]  Captain.
[35:32.000 --> 35:36.000]  Niggas just add the police out, nigga.
[35:36.000 --> 35:40.000]  They just add the police out nigga.
[35:40.000 --> 35:42.000]  They go up and come.
[35:42.000 --> 35:44.000]  Them niggas just got aired out.
[35:44.000 --> 35:48.000]  They just bust on them niggas.
[35:48.000 --> 35:50.000]  That's crazy.
[35:50.000 --> 35:53.000]  Damn.
[35:53.000 --> 35:55.000]  Oh, he goes down.
[35:55.000 --> 36:06.000]  Oh, they just got bust off. That nigga on his knee. Damn!
[36:06.000 --> 36:16.000]  Police just got aired out, nigga. So they don't go over in the rain. They just video, so they can put it on a World Star hip-hop.
[36:16.000 --> 36:21.000]  They just got aired out, nigga. And celebrate all this.
[36:21.000 --> 36:28.000]  Somebody's bust on their ass. And this is the same spirit of the Crips and the Bloods just killing each other mindlessly.
[36:28.000 --> 36:37.000]  Somebody's bust on the police, nigga. But now they're getting, damn, nigga, the gangs to attack the police, calling them a gang.
[36:37.000 --> 36:47.000]  Oh, two sheriffs shot in the face. Two sheriffs shot in the face. They tripping. It's going up in conflict.
[36:47.000 --> 36:53.000]  Nigga's bust on the police, nigga. And that state is on fire and collapsing.
[36:53.000 --> 37:00.000]  Okay, so let's show some more of these videos.
[37:00.000 --> 37:09.000]  Let's show the officer where Black Lives Matter is now protesting and freaking out.
[37:09.000 --> 37:18.000]  In Lancaster, Black Lives Matter has been rioting there and getting upset because a mother and her daughter called on the sun breaking in with a knife threatening to kill them.
[37:18.000 --> 37:24.000]  So they call the cop. The cop comes. He tries to kill the cop. The cop kills him. And it's still a bad guy because, you know, he's a white cop.
[37:24.000 --> 37:29.000]  This is the mindlessness of this. And the very same BLM, when people stand up to them, call the cops.
[37:29.000 --> 37:37.000]  So it's just a death of logic and a bunch of drugged out crazy people thinking that, because the media says they're good, it's their time to go out and celebrate all this.
[37:37.000 --> 37:48.000]  What all they're doing is destroying their own future. And all of it paid for by the chai comms and the globalist like George Soros and a bunch of devil worshipers who admit all the blood they think gives them power.
[37:48.000 --> 37:55.000]  Just like Aztec priests cutting hearts out. The BLM founders say these are blood rituals. That's in the news today.
[37:55.000 --> 38:03.000]  Let's go ahead and roll clip one of the body cam footage of man Chase's cop with a knife.
[38:03.000 --> 38:08.000]  And the police officer walks up, turns the mic on. Here you go.
[38:08.000 --> 38:12.000]  And again, we see these videos every day now.
[38:12.000 --> 38:15.000]  Black guy blows his own head off rioting.
[38:15.000 --> 38:19.000]  Black guy pulls a cop gun on cops rioting.
[38:19.000 --> 38:27.000]  Mom calls cops because he's trying to stab her. This happens.
[38:27.000 --> 38:33.000]  And again, no big deal. I thought this was queued up to right when the audio actually started. Here we go.
[38:33.000 --> 38:37.000]  We got a crowd gathering.
[38:37.000 --> 38:40.000]  20th coming your way.
[38:40.000 --> 38:46.000]  Who wants this job? They call you and then a guy jumps out with a knife trying to stab you.
[38:46.000 --> 38:51.000]  Like a video game. He's just like...
[38:51.000 --> 38:57.000]  The cop runs from him as the man jumps at him with a knife.
[38:57.000 --> 39:01.000]  I mean, look at this. It's like a zombie movie.
[39:01.000 --> 39:08.000]  And it's the rage that it's the cops and the media says the cops are bad and the media says black men are dying everywhere at the hands of cops.
[39:08.000 --> 39:13.000]  So black men start trying to kill cops and then black men start dying.
[39:13.000 --> 39:17.000]  And then BLM gets to go crazy.
[39:17.000 --> 39:22.000]  And again, we've got some footage that when we come back, man with American flag confronts BLM group.
[39:22.000 --> 39:27.000]  Again, in Lancaster, the same place this happens where they're all freaking out.
[39:27.000 --> 39:34.000]  That, oh my gosh, somebody's mama calls the police on the big baby threatening him with a knife and the cop comes and saves them.
[39:34.000 --> 39:37.000]  And he's the bad guy because he's a white devil.
[39:37.000 --> 39:41.000]  What a sick joke. Thank you, Soros. Look what you've done to these people's brains.
[39:41.000 --> 39:43.000]  Thanks a lot CNN, MSNBC.
[39:43.000 --> 39:48.000]  You truly are enemies of humanity, race-baiting, lying scum who will be held accountable.
[39:48.000 --> 39:53.000]  Well, they're right back. Stay with us.
[39:53.000 --> 40:01.000]  There is a metaphysical rule that God has put in place that controls the universe and its free will.
[40:01.000 --> 40:11.000]  That's why the social engineers, the Robert Barrett's, the globalist, the post-humanist, the anti-humans openly tell you what they're doing
[40:11.000 --> 40:16.000]  and openly tell you that your work will soon crap and you need to die because that will save the Earth.
[40:16.000 --> 40:24.000]  But they do everything they can to make the most dystopian, ugly future they can in the movies and in the culture and in all the different publications.
[40:24.000 --> 40:27.000]  They are making you hate yourself. They are making you be depressed.
[40:27.000 --> 40:33.000]  They are making you not have a connection to God because they just want you to die so they can selfishly control the future.
[40:33.000 --> 40:39.000]  And that's what all this is about. You know, they say they're setting up world government to protect us all from our super technologies.
[40:39.000 --> 40:45.000]  While they're the ones running around like bad scientists, endangering the whole planet with a lot of these technologies,
[40:45.000 --> 40:53.000]  the globalists are what is disruptive to human species. They call us disruptive to their power grab. It's time to say no.
[40:53.000 --> 41:02.000]  Big Tech is the global straightjacket of the New World Order. It is the enforcement system, the surveillance system.
[41:02.000 --> 41:10.000]  It's going to track everything you do, everywhere you go, everything you say, everything you basically think, and then reward or punish you for those behaviors.
[41:10.000 --> 41:14.000]  And they're not liberals. That's a complete and total cover.
[41:14.000 --> 41:19.000]  They are monsters that love authoritarianism and are building towards a post-human world.
[41:19.000 --> 41:31.000]  Their mission is to destroy indigenous communities, annihilate small towns, annihilate all human culture and consolidate us all, isolate us all, and then carry out our orderly extermination.
[41:31.000 --> 41:39.000]  This is their public master plan. And COVID-19 is the cover for the rollout of this digital control system.
[41:39.000 --> 41:42.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, it's only going to get worse from here.
[41:42.000 --> 41:49.000]  When you see officials from Apple, Google, Facebook, Twitter, you are looking at people way more smart and way more evil than Hitler.
[41:49.000 --> 41:53.000]  They want to murder you and your family. You have been warned.
[41:53.000 --> 42:04.000]  Dependency, domestication. In the real world, ignorance is not bliss. It's enslavement and it's death.
[42:04.000 --> 42:07.000]  The globalists are teaching us all that we're non-essential.
[42:07.000 --> 42:12.000]  With automation, they're bringing in a world that doesn't empower humanity, but makes us obsolete.
[42:12.000 --> 42:18.000]  But we're not obsolete. We don't have to listen to them. We can farm again. We can garden. We can become self-sufficient.
[42:18.000 --> 42:24.000]  But first, we've got to learn to stand up politically for ourselves and we need to become self-sufficient.
[42:24.000 --> 42:32.000]  That begins with water filtration to take control of that from the globalists and their fluoride and their dumbing down agenda and with storable food.
[42:32.000 --> 42:38.000]  And we have it all, the highest quality, the highest rated at the lowest prices at M4warStore.com.
[42:38.000 --> 42:42.000]  Take action now. You cannot lose unless you do not take action.
[42:42.000 --> 42:49.000]  We have the best water filtration, the best storable food, and it funds the M4war. Take action now while you still can.
[42:49.000 --> 42:54.000]  Become prepared. Become self-sufficient now at M4warStore.com.
[42:56.000 --> 43:10.000]  The party was not going to go on forever. All the welfare, all the entertainment, all the decadence was only designed to get people domesticated, dumbed down, selfish and, most importantly, isolated.
[43:10.000 --> 43:19.000]  And now that most of the population is selfish, isolated and very, very dumbed down and ignorant, the New World Order is facing its move.
[43:19.000 --> 43:25.000]  And they are now going to weaponize the giant masses of foolish followers who believe they just follow orders.
[43:25.000 --> 43:30.000]  They'll get another little piece of green like when the chicken pecks at the lever.
[43:30.000 --> 43:33.000]  But all that they're really going to get is the noose tightening around their foolish neck.
[43:33.000 --> 43:37.000]  Those of us that are aware and informed can laugh at the massive slaves.
[43:37.000 --> 43:44.000]  But remember, they're a dangerous weapon appointed at our throats, and so we've got to save them to save ourselves.
[43:44.000 --> 43:52.000]  And to do that, we've got to expose the globalists. We've got to take it to them politically and absolutely annihilate them with the crimes that they've actually committed.
[43:52.000 --> 44:16.000]  Expose the enemy now.
[44:16.000 --> 44:25.000]  I've learned a lot about human nature in 46 years. And a long time ago, I'd asked God why I was being put through the things I was put through.
[44:25.000 --> 44:35.000]  And God basically in the spirit told me, you're being prepared for a mission.
[44:35.000 --> 44:38.000]  And I'm talking about, and I was like three, four years old.
[44:38.000 --> 44:42.000]  A lot of really interesting stuff went on. I'll just leave it at that.
[44:42.000 --> 44:47.000]  And then by the time I was about 17, I knew what it was I was supposed to do.
[44:47.000 --> 44:51.000]  And I always had the deep understanding. It's not even like a vision. It's a roadmap.
[44:51.000 --> 45:03.000]  It's like you're like a machine, but you have free will that I am to prepare the groundwork for the big wave of that's going to confront Satan and the whole AI world government system.
[45:03.000 --> 45:09.000]  And that I'm one of the key people that brings in the big crop, like I'm the precursor to the big one.
[45:09.000 --> 45:17.000]  And I know those people are out there, the leaders that are going to lead the fight.
[45:17.000 --> 45:25.000]  That said, it's very frustrating. Some obnoxious. Sometimes I'm exhausted because it feels like atmospheres of weight on top of you.
[45:25.000 --> 45:33.000]  The understanding that's what the Bible says with great knowledge comes great sorrow because I don't get to have vitriol.
[45:33.000 --> 45:36.000]  I don't get to have satisfaction in the things I do.
[45:36.000 --> 45:44.000]  Sometimes I'll be a little dark on air because I'm trying to have the facsimile of that because I don't even know how to do it from a good place.
[45:44.000 --> 45:51.000]  The only way I could take enjoyment out of something is to slip out of righteous gear into a little bit of devil gear.
[45:51.000 --> 45:57.000]  And the only reason I explain that is when people know where I'm coming from.
[45:57.000 --> 46:00.000]  We are all fallen creatures.
[46:00.000 --> 46:04.000]  And I don't want to get up here and tell you this negative news to scare you.
[46:04.000 --> 46:13.000]  I believe in you and I believe that when you know the truth, you're going to be able to stand up and warn others and lead others away from the destruction that's coming.
[46:13.000 --> 46:18.000]  I don't say all this to be negative and I don't like to sit up here and say all this, but it's true.
[46:18.000 --> 46:22.000]  So I can't lie to you.
[46:22.000 --> 46:25.000]  The satanic forces on this planet are very real.
[46:25.000 --> 46:30.000]  They're just as real as the oxygen you breathe that you can't see.
[46:30.000 --> 46:38.000]  And they want to kill you and they want to take you away from God and they want your spirit to be with them bound forever.
[46:38.000 --> 46:41.000]  That's a horrific thing.
[46:41.000 --> 46:43.000]  And so everybody better get right.
[46:43.000 --> 46:45.000]  That didn't mean going to one of these fake churches.
[46:45.000 --> 46:50.000]  The spirit of evil is so strong in those churches because the enemy has taken them over.
[46:50.000 --> 46:58.000]  You're going to find God when you pray, humble yourself, and I'm just going to leave it at that.
[46:58.000 --> 47:01.000]  The manifest evil we're seeing is only going to get more intense.
[47:01.000 --> 47:09.000]  And there will undoubtedly come a time when the enemy is actually able to take us off air, but they're going to end up taking everybody else off air.
[47:09.000 --> 47:20.000]  That's why, like before you get caught in a riptide and you've been caught in one, you better get that big gulp of air before you get sucked under and it shoots you out 50 yards down the coast.
[47:20.000 --> 47:23.000]  And relax and don't fight it.
[47:23.000 --> 47:29.000]  And you're going to be inside it.
[47:29.000 --> 47:34.000]  So I'm going to just say this.
[47:34.000 --> 47:39.000]  You'll find out the men from the boys, the women from the girls with the stuff that's happening.
[47:39.000 --> 47:44.000]  You'll find out who wants to fight corruption and who wants to just kind of play games with her.
[47:44.000 --> 47:47.000]  People that just can't really believe stuff's this bad.
[47:47.000 --> 47:50.000]  And those are people that are childlike or immature.
[47:50.000 --> 47:56.000]  They'll wake up later because you and I and others had planted the seeds, but I'll just say this.
[47:56.000 --> 48:12.000]  Your financial support is what allows us to stay on air and put out the talking points that are the most accurate out there that are listened to in the most important sectors of this planet, from the grassroots to the ivory towers, from the councils of government to the councils of war.
[48:12.000 --> 48:20.000]  They know that we are for real and they know we carry the spirit of our future empowerment with us.
[48:20.000 --> 48:22.000]  And they know that they wish to exhaust that spirit.
[48:22.000 --> 48:25.000]  But what we've done is already spread.
[48:25.000 --> 48:28.000]  They will never exhaust the spirit.
[48:28.000 --> 48:35.000]  But I know that we have more work to do before it's time for me to complete my mission.
[48:35.000 --> 48:37.000]  My mission is far from done.
[48:37.000 --> 48:41.000]  Our most important work is now at hand.
[48:41.000 --> 48:45.000]  But I would tell you that you really should go to m4store.com.
[48:45.000 --> 48:56.000]  We saw massive increases in sales of vitamin D3 and zinc and m4store.com when Fauci came out and said, you've got to have it to live.
[48:56.000 --> 48:59.000]  Why do we need Fauci to tell us that?
[48:59.000 --> 49:02.000]  I don't take zinc and vitamin D3 because I'm worried about COVID.
[49:02.000 --> 49:09.000]  I take it because you have to have it to live and any virus or bacteria will kill you if you don't have it.
[49:09.000 --> 49:11.000]  Almost no one dies of starvation.
[49:11.000 --> 49:15.000]  They always shrivel up, get unhealthy and die of a virus.
[49:15.000 --> 49:21.000]  They never call it starvation in Africa or Latin America or areas of Asia or areas of poor areas of Europe or the U.S.
[49:21.000 --> 49:25.000]  They always, oh, they was a sickly child or it was a sickly old woman.
[49:25.000 --> 49:32.000]  And they die from a cold or a flu because they don't have their nutrients.
[49:32.000 --> 49:40.000]  And I've literally had people on the street ask me and guests ask when they're getting on to be a guest, they go, hey, does Alex really believe in those things they sell?
[49:40.000 --> 49:42.000]  You don't need to believe me.
[49:42.000 --> 49:43.000]  Go research it.
[49:43.000 --> 49:46.000]  Essential.
[49:46.000 --> 49:49.000]  And it's essential that you drink purified water.
[49:49.000 --> 49:53.000]  It's essential that you take care of yourself and your family.
[49:53.000 --> 49:56.000]  We have all those needs and we have the best, highest quality, swarble food.
[49:56.000 --> 49:58.000]  The lowest price you're going to find.
[49:58.000 --> 50:00.000]  Ready to ship from one to two weeks.
[50:00.000 --> 50:02.000]  My Patriot runs our back end.
[50:02.000 --> 50:03.000]  It's ordering from us.
[50:03.000 --> 50:04.000]  It's ordering from them.
[50:04.000 --> 50:05.000]  Same price, same selection.
[50:05.000 --> 50:07.000]  You get right in the cube.
[50:07.000 --> 50:10.000]  You don't hear my Patriot running ads on Glenn Beck or Rush Limbaugh.
[50:10.000 --> 50:13.000]  I can normally do because they had so much business they don't need to.
[50:13.000 --> 50:14.000]  But I'm a partner.
[50:14.000 --> 50:18.000]  So we have the food and you get it the quickest with us.
[50:18.000 --> 50:20.000]  Now, here's, I met with Matt Redhawk.
[50:20.000 --> 50:21.000]  He flew here to tell me this.
[50:21.000 --> 50:23.000]  He said I could talk about it on air.
[50:23.000 --> 50:25.000]  I'm trying to get their CEO on tomorrow.
[50:25.000 --> 50:30.000]  They're the biggest food company now in the world for swarble food because they're respected and good only 13 years old, 14 years old.
[50:30.000 --> 50:38.000]  He said, listen, we haven't raised food prices yet and he showed me this, you know, the numbers.
[50:38.000 --> 50:43.000]  He goes, we're barely making any money right now with the deals you've got, which is okay.
[50:43.000 --> 50:44.000]  We're getting great customers.
[50:44.000 --> 50:45.000]  It's a submission that we have.
[50:45.000 --> 50:46.000]  We believe in it.
[50:46.000 --> 50:48.000]  We've had to expand all these factories.
[50:48.000 --> 50:50.000]  We had to buy up, you know, food contracts a couple of years out.
[50:50.000 --> 50:53.000]  We had meetings about that eight months ago and I advised him.
[50:53.000 --> 50:54.000]  I said, I think your instincts are right.
[50:54.000 --> 50:59.000]  When everybody else wasn't sure what to do, I said, buy everything into your hands on this quality.
[50:59.000 --> 51:01.000]  They're in a position now to ship within one to two weeks.
[51:01.000 --> 51:08.000]  They've got four, actually five factories and a bunch of distribution centers.
[51:08.000 --> 51:10.000]  They've now set one up in Austin as well.
[51:10.000 --> 51:23.000]  So I said six and they said definitely by Christmas, they're going to have to raise prices because food prices have gone up 20 to 50%.
[51:23.000 --> 51:34.000]  And they're in fights with Costco and Walmart and everybody else and the big manufacturers of food, the big makers of it, only manufacturer, you know, they prepare it.
[51:34.000 --> 51:36.000]  They process it to work.
[51:36.000 --> 51:48.000]  And the supply chains are breaking down and the prices have gone way up and he's basically not even making money right now with the deals he's got with me because I got a good deal with him.
[51:48.000 --> 51:57.000]  And so this is the time to get your storeable food before the prices go up, go to info wars, store.com, the full selection of my Patriot supplies there.
[51:57.000 --> 51:59.000]  And they've got specialty diets.
[51:59.000 --> 52:01.000]  They've got it all three months, six months, your supplies.
[52:01.000 --> 52:05.000]  They have the best internal packaging, external packaging.
[52:05.000 --> 52:09.000]  I mean, you go by plastic tote containers, you put ammunition in or whatever.
[52:09.000 --> 52:14.000]  They basically cost at Walmart as much as this costs with food in it and it's containers like that.
[52:14.000 --> 52:17.000]  I mean, these are first class sealed containers.
[52:17.000 --> 52:20.000]  You open it up and then the top goes back on and seals.
[52:20.000 --> 52:22.000]  It's amazing.
[52:22.000 --> 52:29.000]  I know I harp on the containers all the time because so much trouble food is not high quality or the containers suck and they fall apart and stuff can get into it.
[52:29.000 --> 52:30.000]  Not these.
[52:30.000 --> 52:31.000]  It's the best.
[52:31.000 --> 52:32.000]  It's why I went out and chose them.

[54:23.000 --> 54:27.000]  I'll get into the latest attacks on free speech that are frauds within frauds.
[54:27.000 --> 54:30.000]  The latest on the race wars are trying to start.
[54:30.000 --> 54:35.000]  BLM admitting that their roots are Satanism and human sacrifice, murder, and so much more.
[54:35.000 --> 54:36.000]  Stay with us.
[54:36.000 --> 54:38.000]  We'll be right back in full wars.com.
[54:38.000 --> 54:39.000]  News wars.com.
[54:39.000 --> 54:40.000]  Tomorrow's news today.
[54:40.000 --> 54:41.000]  Thank you.
[54:41.000 --> 54:48.000]  A little more than a decade ago, it happened in Salt Lake City, Utah.
[54:48.000 --> 54:53.000]  The public came out on a very clear day and looked up more than 60,000 feet.
[54:53.000 --> 55:01.000]  What they thought was a giant UFO was actually a large DARPA government surveillance blimp.
[55:01.000 --> 55:05.000]  There were thousands of phone calls made to the police departments, newspapers, TV stations,
[55:05.000 --> 55:07.000]  thinking it was an alien craft.
[55:07.000 --> 55:10.000]  When the public was told that it was a blimp, they didn't want to believe it.
[55:10.000 --> 55:13.000]  You see, they'd already told them themselves it was a UFO.
[55:13.000 --> 55:16.000]  So they had cognitive distance.
[55:16.000 --> 55:20.000]  It's kind of like the fact that COVID-19 is hundreds of times weaker than the flu.
[55:20.000 --> 55:26.000]  Let people still want to live in fear and wear a mask outside, even in their cars, even in their houses.
[55:26.000 --> 55:28.000]  Well, it happened again over New Jersey yesterday.
[55:28.000 --> 55:34.000]  The Goodyear blimp was out there with a big gumbo-tron TV screen on the side of it and had flashing lights on,
[55:34.000 --> 55:35.000]  just like an airplane.
[55:35.000 --> 55:39.000]  The public thought it was a UFO, and now the public still believes it was a UFO,
[55:39.000 --> 55:40.000]  and now they were told it wasn't.
[55:40.000 --> 55:44.000]  You see, that's called a highly suggestible group of slaves.
[55:44.000 --> 55:51.000]  The clock is ticking on the once-free world, and the free press is under attack more than ever.
[55:51.000 --> 55:56.000]  I now see videos, 10 or 15 times a day, without even trying to find them,
[55:56.000 --> 55:58.000]  of press being arrested in the United States,
[55:58.000 --> 56:02.000]  press being arrested in Canada, the UK, Europe, Australia, New Zealand,
[56:02.000 --> 56:07.000]  and it's always the so-called liberal left, the defenders of speech, doing it.
[56:07.000 --> 56:09.000]  They are the authoritarians.
[56:09.000 --> 56:17.000]  They work for the CHICOM Globalist Combine, and they are working around the clock to silence info wars.
[56:17.000 --> 56:22.000]  Just as we were the group they started with three years ago, they test out everything new on us,
[56:22.000 --> 56:26.000]  and a lot of what I can't get into on air at this point, I'll be able to reveal this later,
[56:26.000 --> 56:30.000]  but I just want to make you all realize that your support, your word of mouth,
[56:30.000 --> 56:34.000]  your prayer is absolutely essential, and I thank you all for it.
[56:34.000 --> 56:41.000]  But whatever you do, take advantage of the great products that support the info war and make your life healthier and better at infowarstore.com.
[56:41.000 --> 56:44.000]  Please go to infowarstore.com today.
[56:54.000 --> 56:59.000]  You know, if anything that's happening at CNN and anybody who buys your book,
[56:59.000 --> 57:03.000]  it's really just one of those things that is dividing our nation.
[57:03.000 --> 57:07.000]  And I don't believe in dividing our nation. It hurts our great nation.
[57:07.000 --> 57:35.000]  And so, CNN is really the enemy of the truth, and that's my opinion. Thank you.
[57:37.000 --> 57:41.000]  They came in peace.
[58:08.000 --> 58:15.000]  No news, I'll put you in the enemy of America. Bill Gates loves you. Take the vaccine.
[58:15.000 --> 58:21.000]  Don't run. CNN is your friend.
[58:21.000 --> 58:24.000]  This is CNN.
[58:26.000 --> 58:33.000]  Right in front of our very eyes, we are seeing the globalist deep state at work.
[58:33.000 --> 58:41.000]  Black Lives Matter and Antifa. What a terrible, terrible blight upon all people.
[58:41.000 --> 58:51.000]  Antifa, which they claim means anti-fascists, is absurd, ludicrous, and totally opposite of what they claim to be.
[58:51.000 --> 58:55.000]  They are not anti-fascists. They are the fascists.
[58:55.000 --> 59:06.000]  Black Lives Matter, it's a ruse, R-U-S-E. If Black Lives Matter, then why don't we do something about what is happening
[59:06.000 --> 59:13.000]  on black, killing black, in places like Chicago, Detroit, Baltimore, Washington, D.C.
[59:13.000 --> 59:16.000]  It's an endless list that won't be missed.
[59:16.000 --> 59:23.000]  So, the bottom line here is that it's about divide, confusion, chaos, and conquer.
[59:23.000 --> 59:27.000]  What we're watching here is insanity.
[59:27.000 --> 59:37.000]  In particular, the deep state Democrats and their suspicious, despicable, lying media are fanning the flames.
[59:37.000 --> 59:42.000]  I urge all of my brothers and sisters, don't go for the ghosts.
[59:42.000 --> 59:45.000]  Okay, don't be duke, good week, bamboozle.
[59:45.000 --> 59:53.000]  Okay, understand that we are in this struggle as patriots, as U.S. citizens, together.
[59:53.000 --> 59:56.000]  What we have on our side is we have each other.
[59:56.000 --> 1:00:07.000]  Each other, and that's extremely powerful, and that's something that the media, the deep state Democrats, and the Rhino Republicans, for that matter,
[1:00:07.000 --> 1:00:12.000]  they don't want you to know that. They want you to think that you're alone, you're by yourself.
[1:00:12.000 --> 1:00:21.000]  And there are a lot of people, millions, millions, who are thinking just like you.
[1:00:21.000 --> 1:00:32.000]  This is our republic. This is all about fun and games and hurting people and destroying, not building, not serving the people body and soul,
[1:00:32.000 --> 1:00:34.000]  but the exact opposite.
[1:00:34.000 --> 1:00:46.000]  So I plead with, implore, with, to, all my brothers and sisters of all colors, get a grip on reality, stop this madness, stop this insanity,
[1:00:46.000 --> 1:00:51.000]  and those who won't stop it, need to be stopped.
[1:00:51.000 --> 1:01:09.000]  Larry Pinkney, an original Black Panther, the real deal. The answer to 1984, 1776.
[1:01:09.000 --> 1:01:20.000]  Infowars has been banned, arrested, attacked and threatened,
[1:01:20.000 --> 1:01:23.000]  because we are effective.
[1:01:23.000 --> 1:01:31.000]  The Great Awakening is here. Go to banned.video, download the videos and share.
[1:01:31.000 --> 1:01:42.000]  Support the information war at infowarstore.com and never give up the fight.
[1:01:42.000 --> 1:01:53.000]  Believe me, this is the fight. All right, 60 seconds away from news, information and so much more. Stay with us.
[1:01:53.000 --> 1:02:01.000]  I don't want to be right about this prediction. In fact, it's not a prediction, it is a forecast.
[1:02:01.000 --> 1:02:08.000]  If we continue down the economic road we're on globally with the ongoing COVID-19 lockdowns and the structure of productivity,
[1:02:08.000 --> 1:02:13.000]  it will continue to accelerate these ripple effects that are breaking down supply chains that will
[1:02:13.000 --> 1:02:20.000]  star tens of millions of additional people in the third world and destroy decades of human infrastructure that's been built.
[1:02:20.000 --> 1:02:27.000]  It will annihilate the funding of that and put the entire first world in even deeper debt, which we're being maneuvered into.
[1:02:27.000 --> 1:02:36.000]  So I really think the smart move is to end all these lockdowns immediately and prosecute the people that launched the giant COVID scam,
[1:02:36.000 --> 1:02:40.000]  the giant COVID con game, that's really just a big power grab.
[1:02:40.000 --> 1:02:46.000]  But in case we can't reverse all this, we better start digging in and getting storeable food and getting prepared to be self-sufficient
[1:02:46.000 --> 1:03:07.000]  because that's the name of their game, is to make us dependent on them, so get self-sufficient now in FullWars.com.
[1:03:16.000 --> 1:03:26.000]  The real Black Panther Party had to say about BLM and ANTIFA and it's just pure oratory truth.
[1:03:26.000 --> 1:03:34.000]  You know, there was the father of rhetoric, was a Greek, and I forget his name, but they said he has a perfect orator.
[1:03:34.000 --> 1:03:39.000]  Well, truth is the perfect rhetoric.
[1:03:39.000 --> 1:03:46.000]  So at the bottom of the hour, I'm going, no, I'll err at the end of this segment, I'll show you the bad stuff and then we'll get to the good stuff.
[1:03:46.000 --> 1:03:48.000]  I'm going to play it again.
[1:03:48.000 --> 1:03:53.000]  And we should have very painty chaps on show.
[1:03:53.000 --> 1:03:55.000]  He should really be on more.
[1:03:55.000 --> 1:03:59.000]  I know he takes care of his family and a bunch of people where he lives.
[1:03:59.000 --> 1:04:02.000]  But I mean, imagine the system wanted that.
[1:04:02.000 --> 1:04:05.000]  That was the real Black Panther, super smart, well-spoken.
[1:04:05.000 --> 1:04:09.000]  They got set up and infiltrated, like American militias do, and put in jail.
[1:04:09.000 --> 1:04:13.000]  The new Black Panther Party is run by the Southern Probably Law Center and ADL.
[1:04:13.000 --> 1:04:19.000]  It's a terrorist organization, basically a Black supremacist group.
[1:04:19.000 --> 1:04:24.000]  Spotted the most horrible things, but that's just where all this goes.
[1:04:24.000 --> 1:04:26.000]  And I don't show these things to inflame folks.
[1:04:26.000 --> 1:04:28.000]  I show this to exposes behind it.
[1:04:28.000 --> 1:04:35.000]  The FBI leaked, that's a good start, to CBS News that Antifa is run by a Democratic Party, basically.
[1:04:35.000 --> 1:04:38.000]  But they said, oh, we just know it's organized.
[1:04:38.000 --> 1:04:42.000]  Well, last hour I showed their founding documents, their funding.
[1:04:42.000 --> 1:04:45.000]  Full-page ads, the group buys the New York Times.
[1:04:45.000 --> 1:04:47.000]  I mean, you don't know who's organizing it.
[1:04:47.000 --> 1:04:50.000]  Antifa begins the overthrow of Trump, Pence, full-page ads.
[1:04:50.000 --> 1:04:52.000]  Got the name of the group, funding it right there.
[1:04:52.000 --> 1:04:55.000]  They get money from the Communist Chinese Party.
[1:04:55.000 --> 1:05:02.000]  I thought this was important enough four or five years ago to infiltrate it with an undercover person.
[1:05:02.000 --> 1:05:06.000]  And we did typecast somebody and find somebody that looked like they were a methhead, but they were a good guy.
[1:05:06.000 --> 1:05:08.000]  They had health problems.
[1:05:08.000 --> 1:05:14.000]  Just because they looked like a ghoul they were allowed in, was run at UT in a large auditorium with a UT board member running it
[1:05:14.000 --> 1:05:18.000]  and pledging allegiance to Mao Zedong, G.G. Ping and others.
[1:05:18.000 --> 1:05:22.000]  You think I'm joking?
[1:05:22.000 --> 1:05:25.000]  I told you that Confucius Institute was running them.
[1:05:25.000 --> 1:05:30.000]  You notice that got shut down two years later.
[1:05:30.000 --> 1:05:32.000]  You can't make this stuff up.
[1:05:32.000 --> 1:05:35.000]  So you get all shown here.
[1:05:35.000 --> 1:05:36.000]  We just joined us.
[1:05:36.000 --> 1:05:38.000]  I'd like to say my name over and over again.
[1:05:38.000 --> 1:05:41.000]  We're on hundreds of radio stations, so I have to announce each segment who I am.
[1:05:41.000 --> 1:05:45.000]  Everybody's now basically online, so they hear an actual radio show online or a TV show online.
[1:05:45.000 --> 1:05:47.000]  They're like, why is he saying his name?
[1:05:47.000 --> 1:05:48.000]  Because radio, you have to.
[1:05:48.000 --> 1:05:53.000]  Or the stations turn you off, but continuing.
[1:05:53.000 --> 1:05:55.000]  And our other host, Owen, is amazing.
[1:05:55.000 --> 1:05:59.000]  And David Knight is amazing, but we've always got to remember radio stations are picking yourself.
[1:05:59.000 --> 1:06:00.000]  So we have to narrate things.
[1:06:00.000 --> 1:06:01.000]  That's our main audience.
[1:06:01.000 --> 1:06:02.000]  It's still radio.
[1:06:02.000 --> 1:06:04.000]  So the de-platforming didn't work.
[1:06:04.000 --> 1:06:05.000]  Thank God.
[1:06:05.000 --> 1:06:06.000]  It was all our great affiliates.
[1:06:06.000 --> 1:06:07.000]  So they are beyond critical.
[1:06:07.000 --> 1:06:09.000]  They are paramount to support.
[1:06:09.000 --> 1:06:10.000]  You're a listener.
[1:06:10.000 --> 1:06:12.000]  Does your local church really fight the Satanist?
[1:06:12.000 --> 1:06:15.000]  Does it really fight abortion like we do?
[1:06:15.000 --> 1:06:17.000]  And I'm not up here like a Pharisee saying I'm great.
[1:06:17.000 --> 1:06:22.000]  Those local stations are doing God's work more than that little whorehouse church.
[1:06:22.000 --> 1:06:25.000]  So give them $100 a month.
[1:06:25.000 --> 1:06:27.000]  Tithe to those local radio stations if you want to win.
[1:06:27.000 --> 1:06:29.000]  I'm not here telling you what to do.
[1:06:29.000 --> 1:06:30.000]  I'm telling you what I do.
[1:06:30.000 --> 1:06:32.000]  And you know it's the right thing to do.
[1:06:32.000 --> 1:06:35.000]  All right, continuing here.
[1:06:35.000 --> 1:06:40.000]  And it's so changed the face of the country, folks, that our listeners support our local stations.
[1:06:40.000 --> 1:06:45.000]  I can't tell you how many stations pick us up at night for a year or so that move us to earlier in the evening
[1:06:45.000 --> 1:06:50.000]  and then end up taking us live because they get ratings and people support them and it's the truth.
[1:06:50.000 --> 1:06:55.000]  And now more stations pick us up because they used to sound crazy.
[1:06:55.000 --> 1:07:01.000]  I know, but now see we're normalized because we've now gotten to the chapter of the book that I was telling you was coming.
[1:07:01.000 --> 1:07:04.000]  And now you hear me telling you the next chapter I knew about.
[1:07:04.000 --> 1:07:08.000]  You weren't ready to hear it.
[1:07:08.000 --> 1:07:15.000]  But this isn't humans running this. Those who don't believe in God call it aliens.
[1:07:15.000 --> 1:07:24.000]  We read the Bible tells us it's a fallen entity in another dimension, but right next to us and his soldiers right next to us.
[1:07:24.000 --> 1:07:30.000]  And the mission is exterminate all life on earth, not just human.
[1:07:30.000 --> 1:07:32.000]  You look at what the globalists are doing.
[1:07:32.000 --> 1:07:34.000]  That's what they're doing.
[1:07:34.000 --> 1:07:39.000]  And that leads me to this before I get into all the Antifa stuff. I'm glad that they just put that on screen and they reminded me.
[1:07:39.000 --> 1:07:44.000]  I almost started the show with this today to talk about the delusions.
[1:07:44.000 --> 1:07:51.000]  When Orson Welles did a radio broadcast.
[1:07:51.000 --> 1:07:53.000]  I forget when was the 30s.
[1:07:53.000 --> 1:07:57.000]  Look up and Orson Welles did that guys war the world.
[1:07:57.000 --> 1:08:00.000]  And he said Martians are attacking.
[1:08:00.000 --> 1:08:07.000]  And they've got tripod legs. People went outside with their 30 odd sixes and shot water towers.
[1:08:07.000 --> 1:08:10.000]  Because it was so well done how he did the hoax.
[1:08:10.000 --> 1:08:15.000]  Well, I remember over 10 years ago, there was a big blimp over Salt Lake City, super high.
[1:08:15.000 --> 1:08:18.000]  It was a DARPA blimp and people thought it was a UFO.
[1:08:18.000 --> 1:08:20.000]  They zoomed in on it had propellers on it.
[1:08:20.000 --> 1:08:26.000]  Well, over New Jersey was the good year blimp with big flashing ads on it and flashing security lights.
[1:08:26.000 --> 1:08:31.000]  We'll play that audio in a moment and thousands of cars not not the headline says doesn't stop.
[1:08:31.000 --> 1:08:33.000]  We see dozens on that tape. I saw the other footage.
[1:08:33.000 --> 1:08:38.000]  The highways stopped because people were so ignorant.
[1:08:38.000 --> 1:08:41.000]  1938. You did that October 30th.
[1:08:41.000 --> 1:08:45.000]  War the world.
[1:08:45.000 --> 1:08:50.000]  They were so ignorant and so disconnected from reality that when they saw blimp,
[1:08:50.000 --> 1:08:53.000]  they saw aliens because the media talked about aliens.
[1:08:53.000 --> 1:08:57.000]  Aliens aren't going to come in a big flying saucer, folks.
[1:08:57.000 --> 1:09:00.000]  They're already here.
[1:09:00.000 --> 1:09:04.000]  And in laboratories, they've already created thousands of species.
[1:09:04.000 --> 1:09:09.000]  They admit that have no human or animal or plant DNA or RNA.
[1:09:09.000 --> 1:09:13.000]  They've just manufactured. They call it nanotech, but it's living.
[1:09:13.000 --> 1:09:20.000]  That's alien. Aliens could send us over the radio telescope a code to resequence DNA or RNA.
[1:09:20.000 --> 1:09:24.000]  And we could build an alien here. They made the movie species about that.
[1:09:24.000 --> 1:09:33.000]  Well, I can tell you they've taken some of the radio stuff they know is obviously not just random pulsar stars and things like that.
[1:09:33.000 --> 1:09:38.000]  And they've been doing that. So they've been getting some messages as well in this dimension.
[1:09:38.000 --> 1:09:42.000]  So let's talk about the reality of this.
[1:09:42.000 --> 1:09:48.000]  Go ahead and roll the audio in New Jersey for radio listeners of the public thinking it's a flying saucer.
[1:09:48.000 --> 1:09:54.000]  I know there's a Jumbotron TV on the side of it with Miller-like commercials. Here it is.
[1:09:54.000 --> 1:10:11.000]  Look, the whole street is f***ing up. This is a f***ing flying spaceship.
[1:10:11.000 --> 1:10:22.000]  Yo, look at that. Look at everybody in the highway right now.
[1:10:22.000 --> 1:10:25.000]  I don't know, bro.
[1:10:25.000 --> 1:10:38.000]  And by the way, these people are all so stupid that almost all the videos don't even have it in screen because people don't even look through their camera, through the phone.
[1:10:38.000 --> 1:10:46.000]  They just stare and then hold it in front of them like zombies.
[1:10:46.000 --> 1:10:53.000]  Now, speaking of aliens.
[1:10:53.000 --> 1:11:01.000]  So again, 14 black men are killed wrongfully each year by police where they didn't have a gun turns out it's a mistake.
[1:11:01.000 --> 1:11:13.000]  It's about 14. 2,000 die a year at the hands of black men, black men do in Chicago. No one cares.
[1:11:13.000 --> 1:11:16.000]  Again, that's perception over reality.
[1:11:16.000 --> 1:11:20.000]  And they'll tell you in advertising, I never believe this. I think it's a fraud that perception is reality.
[1:11:20.000 --> 1:11:30.000]  No, it's not. You can take 10 hits of acid and get up on a 50-story building and think you are a duck that's going to fly down to the bottom and you jump off and you die.
[1:11:30.000 --> 1:11:36.000]  You can imagine that you're a pterodactyl. You're going to fly off. No, you die unless you've got a parachute.
[1:11:36.000 --> 1:11:43.000]  So perception is not reality. Perception is delusion.
[1:11:43.000 --> 1:11:55.000]  But you've got black people all over the United States killing white people every day because they believe there's an epidemic of black people being killed by police officers.
[1:11:55.000 --> 1:11:59.000]  And then you go talk to the Black Lives Matter events. We've done it.
[1:11:59.000 --> 1:12:04.000]  You've seen the videos that we've shot, Owen Shot, Savannah Hernandez, myself, many others.
[1:12:04.000 --> 1:12:13.000]  And we go, hey, you know, statistically, they've killed 23 million black people and police total kill about 200 black people a year.
[1:12:13.000 --> 1:12:19.000]  Shut up, Nazi. I'm going to knock you in your head. You racist KKK.
[1:12:19.000 --> 1:12:23.000]  And I'm like, actually, that's Hillary. That's them. Planned Parenthood was set up to kill you.
[1:12:23.000 --> 1:12:29.000]  Shut up. I'm going to kill you. You threatened to kill me.
[1:12:29.000 --> 1:12:35.000]  And again, there's that emotion of, hey, 14 dead black men, but the media makes a big deal out of it versus millions.
[1:12:35.000 --> 1:12:38.000]  And it just, it's, it's, it's, it's incredible.
[1:12:38.000 --> 1:12:41.000]  And the globalists would say, well, these people are done. They deserve to die. See?
[1:12:41.000 --> 1:12:44.000]  No, folks, this has been a dumbing down process.
[1:12:44.000 --> 1:12:47.000]  And now they're using the dumb down as weapons against us all.
[1:12:47.000 --> 1:12:51.000]  We'll be right back with a very picky piece I've talked about. Stay with us.
[1:12:51.000 --> 1:12:55.000]  The trick that social engineers use is very, very simple.
[1:12:55.000 --> 1:13:07.000]  They just teach us that the architecture of civilization, that the trajectory of a species is designed by these ever-knowing, loving liberal technocrats.
[1:13:07.000 --> 1:13:10.000]  And that if we just sit back and enjoy the ride, everything will be great.
[1:13:10.000 --> 1:13:16.000]  But then they tell us that humans are obsolete, not essential, and we're bad for the earth and we need to be phased out.
[1:13:16.000 --> 1:13:27.000]  So they're very open about what they're doing and they count on us just being very passive living in the matrix like system that they're building.
[1:13:27.000 --> 1:13:34.000]  But what defines humans more than anything from the rest of the quote animal kingdom is that we control our environment.
[1:13:34.000 --> 1:13:38.000]  We build our own environments. We create our own systems.
[1:13:38.000 --> 1:13:44.000]  We really geoengineer and terraform the planet and its systems towards our aims.
[1:13:44.000 --> 1:13:49.000]  But instead we're acting like animals and like the globalists play the part of humans and us as cattle.
[1:13:49.000 --> 1:13:51.000]  And that's the trick.
[1:13:51.000 --> 1:14:01.000]  Well, Mark Zuckerberg on paper two weeks ago put in hundreds of millions of dollars with Bloomberg to launch this operation red mirage to contest the election
[1:14:01.000 --> 1:14:04.000]  when it's overwhelmingly clear that Trump has won on election night.
[1:14:04.000 --> 1:14:12.000]  Now he's come out the statement and told all the media in the United States that they better get behind saying that Trump basically lost
[1:14:12.000 --> 1:14:15.000]  and they're not going to let Trump declare victory even though it's overwhelming.
[1:14:15.000 --> 1:14:22.000]  They'll have 95% of the vote done on election night and even if you added all the other votes in against it, he'd be the winner.
[1:14:22.000 --> 1:14:25.000]  They are going to steal this election. They're preparing everyone.
[1:14:25.000 --> 1:14:27.000]  You've seen all the scams. They've already run.
[1:14:27.000 --> 1:14:35.000]  Trump is surrounded by tyrants, but he has we the people and he has true media, not independent media, the real media.
[1:14:35.000 --> 1:14:41.000]  So now more than ever, it's critical to share the live streams, the videos, the articles and the information info wars.com
[1:14:41.000 --> 1:14:51.000]  because the globalists fear it most because we were the first to expose their plan to contest the election and drag it out to keep the American people from re-electing President Trump.
[1:15:11.000 --> 1:15:20.000]  Celebrating the shooting of police officers, the wounding and killing across the country versus a original founding member of the Black Panther Party,
[1:15:20.000 --> 1:15:26.000]  Larry Pinkney, who they actually set up and put in prison because he was effective at bringing people together, not dividing them.
[1:15:26.000 --> 1:15:29.000]  The new Black Panther Party works for Soros.
[1:15:29.000 --> 1:15:31.000]  The new order to create racial division.
[1:15:31.000 --> 1:15:35.000]  You're not alone. Millions preparing to fight back.
[1:15:35.000 --> 1:15:42.000]  This video went super viral, not at Bandod video. It got a couple hundred thousand, three hundred thousand views there, but millions of views across the Internet.
[1:15:42.000 --> 1:15:45.000]  Now it needs to be shared more than ever.
[1:15:45.000 --> 1:15:50.000]  Larry Pinkney from blackactivistwg.org. Here he is.
[1:15:50.000 --> 1:15:59.000]  Right in front of our very eyes, we are seeing the globalist deep state at work.
[1:15:59.000 --> 1:16:07.000]  Black Lives Matter and Antifa. What a terrible, terrible blight upon all people.
[1:16:07.000 --> 1:16:17.000]  Antifa, which they claim means anti-fascist, is absurd, ludicrous, and totally opposite of what they claim to be.
[1:16:17.000 --> 1:16:21.000]  They are not anti-fascists. They are the fascists.
[1:16:21.000 --> 1:16:25.000]  Black Lives Matter, if they lose R-U-S-E.
[1:16:25.000 --> 1:16:39.000]  If Black Lives Matter, then why don't we do something about what is happening, black on black, killing black, in places like Chicago, Detroit, Baltimore, Washington, D.C.
[1:16:39.000 --> 1:16:42.000]  It's an endless list that won't be missed.
[1:16:42.000 --> 1:16:49.000]  So the bottom line here is that it's about divide, confusion, chaos, and conquer.
[1:16:49.000 --> 1:17:03.000]  What we're watching here is insanity. In particular, the deep state Democrats and their suspicious, despicable, lying media are fanning the flames.
[1:17:03.000 --> 1:17:08.000]  I urge all of my brothers and sisters, don't go for the ghosts.
[1:17:08.000 --> 1:17:18.000]  Don't be duke, goodwink, bamboozle. Understand that we are in this struggle as patriots, as U.S. citizens, together.
[1:17:18.000 --> 1:17:23.000]  What we have on our side is we have each other. Each other.
[1:17:23.000 --> 1:17:34.000]  And that's extremely powerful. And that's something that the media, the deep state Democrats, and the Rhino Republicans, for that matter, they don't want you to know that.
[1:17:34.000 --> 1:17:40.000]  They want you to think that you're alone. You're by yourself. You're not alone. You're not by yourself.
[1:17:40.000 --> 1:17:48.000]  And there are a lot of people, millions, millions, who are thinking just like you.
[1:17:48.000 --> 1:18:00.000]  This is our republic. This is all about fun and games and hurting people and destroying, not building, not serving the people body and soul, but the exact opposite.
[1:18:00.000 --> 1:18:09.000]  So I plead with, implore with, to all my brothers and sisters of all colors, get a grip on reality.
[1:18:09.000 --> 1:18:17.000]  Stop this madness. Stop this insanity. And those who won't stop it need to be stopped.
[1:18:22.000 --> 1:18:27.000]  Now that's eloquence. That's truth. That's power.
[1:18:27.000 --> 1:18:31.000]  That's one of the founders, the Black Panther Party. And that's why they locked him up.
[1:18:31.000 --> 1:18:35.000]  The FBI files came out later. They set him up and put him in prison.
[1:18:35.000 --> 1:18:45.000]  You know who apologized before he died for being part of it? Ted Gunnerson, who was a hero. He exposed pedophile rings, everything.
[1:18:45.000 --> 1:18:51.000]  They were told that the new Black Panther Party, the Black Panther Party was communist, the new Black Panther Party was globalist.
[1:18:51.000 --> 1:18:57.000]  So they went after him. They set him up. They put him in prison.
[1:18:57.000 --> 1:19:01.000]  But that's because they were actually trying to empower people.
[1:19:01.000 --> 1:19:19.000]  You don't see the new Black Panther Party or BLM being put in prison. You see them getting hundreds of millions of dollars from Soros a year, hundreds of millions from Nike and Microsoft and Apple to cover up the slave factories they've got in China.
[1:19:19.000 --> 1:19:24.000]  And that is the reality.
[1:19:24.000 --> 1:19:30.000]  See, real leaders, whether they be black or white or brown, get shut down. They get attacked.
[1:19:30.000 --> 1:19:35.000]  You can see they're trying to shut us down and put us in prison right now, too.
[1:19:35.000 --> 1:19:39.000]  They're ever trying. But thanks to your prayers or support, we're still on air.
[1:19:39.000 --> 1:19:46.000]  But let's, before I hit the big nose, so much of it, I need to get into the huge COVID-19 news. It's all coming to a head.
[1:19:46.000 --> 1:19:55.000]  And the decision about which way we're going to go, we are now at that fork, at that crossroads, at that juncture, at that jump point.
[1:19:55.000 --> 1:20:01.000]  That's next segment. And Joe Rogan just interviewed Edward Snowden again for another mega bombshell.
[1:20:01.000 --> 1:20:08.000]  And of course, Snowden talked about trailblazers exposing the system.
[1:20:08.000 --> 1:20:14.000]  And so we'll get to that coming up next segment.
[1:20:14.000 --> 1:20:22.000]  We'll talk about a Julian Assange pardon that needs to happen.
[1:20:22.000 --> 1:20:25.000]  And a lot of people have asked, why aren't you on Joe Rogan yet?
[1:20:25.000 --> 1:20:28.000]  Well, Joe did tell me he wanted me to be one of his first guests when he got on Spotify.
[1:20:28.000 --> 1:20:31.000]  That became a huge international news issue.
[1:20:31.000 --> 1:20:42.000]  And then they tried to deplatform Joe and did a whole SJW event against Joe and a whole disappearing of Joe.
[1:20:42.000 --> 1:20:46.000]  And they engaged in that.
[1:20:46.000 --> 1:20:50.000]  What's the term they use? It's on the tip of my tongue.
[1:20:50.000 --> 1:20:55.000]  When they deplatform somebody, it's not the term they use now.
[1:20:55.000 --> 1:20:58.000]  It's not called deplatforming. It's called cancel culture. There you go.
[1:20:58.000 --> 1:21:01.000]  They attempted to cancel Joe when I made that announcement.
[1:21:01.000 --> 1:21:04.000]  Seems in a good mood, telling me all the stuff at night, I come up here and do a show about it.
[1:21:04.000 --> 1:21:05.000]  It was a huge deal.
[1:21:05.000 --> 1:21:12.000]  Media spends what I said, and that becomes a whole cattywampus situation, but we'll be making some announcements very, very soon.
[1:21:12.000 --> 1:21:18.000]  But yes, Snowden gave credit that we were the trailblazers fighting the Patriot Act.
[1:21:18.000 --> 1:21:24.000]  And of course, that was part of what influenced him as a listener of the show to do what he did.
[1:21:24.000 --> 1:21:27.000]  And I mean, I was told by folks that Snowden was a listener.
[1:21:27.000 --> 1:21:30.000]  I was told that by folks that have talked to him.
[1:21:30.000 --> 1:21:35.000]  I couldn't confirm that. I've never talked to Snowden, but Snowden basically just confirmed that on Joe Rogan.
[1:21:35.000 --> 1:21:37.000]  So that's coming up next segment as well.
[1:21:37.000 --> 1:21:40.000]  But I need to get to these clips I mentioned.
[1:21:40.000 --> 1:21:47.000]  Again, here's the body cam footage of the man chasing a cop with a knife after the mother calls him to the house saying he was threatening to kill her.
[1:21:47.000 --> 1:21:52.000]  The cop shoots him and now they're having BLM freak out in Lancaster, Pennsylvania. Here's that clip.
[1:21:52.000 --> 1:22:06.000]  Get back. Get back.
[1:22:06.000 --> 1:22:12.000]  So a guy comes jumping at you like a video game character in a zombie movie with a butcher knife.
[1:22:12.000 --> 1:22:17.000]  And you defend yourself and now BLM's freaking out the national media saying this is wrong.
[1:22:17.000 --> 1:22:22.000]  Here's the video of a man with American flag in front. Black lives don't matter.
[1:22:22.000 --> 1:22:30.000]  That's really what the group is in the same town in Lancaster where this happened. Here it is.
[1:22:30.000 --> 1:22:35.000]  Good place to go. It's a nice place where you're standing in front of is a nice place.
[1:22:35.000 --> 1:22:42.000]  Why don't you go south, Lancaster, where there's no street lights and why the violence is happening there?
[1:22:42.000 --> 1:22:48.000]  There ain't no violence, only violence. Wait, you were standing in front of the police?
[1:22:48.000 --> 1:22:54.000]  I am here to be in. I can't do that at the house. This year? No, not this year.
[1:22:54.000 --> 1:23:00.000]  This year he didn't stab nobody, that happened in 2019. No the facts, that was last year.
[1:23:00.000 --> 1:23:08.000]  I can tell you something. I look back. I can say that justice doesn't exist in this community.
[1:23:08.000 --> 1:23:14.400]  I don't think that anybody is really saying that adjusting to the truth is justified.
[1:23:14.400 --> 1:23:17.640]  So he stabbed four people.
[1:23:17.640 --> 1:23:18.640]  Now they're saying more.
[1:23:18.640 --> 1:23:19.640]  He's in a stabbing people.
[1:23:19.640 --> 1:23:20.640]  He's dead now.
[1:23:20.640 --> 1:23:25.040]  But he stabbed a bunch of innocent people, by the way, black people, before.
[1:23:25.040 --> 1:23:26.720]  And now they're saying, well, that was a year ago.
[1:23:26.720 --> 1:23:27.720]  It's okay.
[1:23:27.720 --> 1:23:28.720]  They tried to stab the cop.
[1:23:28.720 --> 1:23:29.720]  This is the mental illness.
[1:23:29.720 --> 1:23:34.280]  This is Antifa defending what this guy did.
[1:23:34.280 --> 1:23:37.120]  Now the guy they were about to get into fight with was pretty jacked.
[1:23:37.120 --> 1:23:39.640]  So they knew they were about to get their ass kicked, so they were being a little bit
[1:23:39.640 --> 1:23:40.800]  friendly because they're a bunch of cowards.
[1:23:40.800 --> 1:23:42.280]  He'd been an old lady in a wheelchair.
[1:23:42.280 --> 1:23:44.000]  They'd probably have gone completely crazy.
[1:23:44.000 --> 1:23:45.000]  We'll be right back.
[1:23:45.000 --> 1:23:48.480]  Stay with us on Alan Jones, newswars.com.
[1:23:48.480 --> 1:23:52.560]  What if you could cut your heating bills this winter with your existing wood-burning fireplace
[1:23:52.560 --> 1:23:54.720]  and not spend thousands doing it?
[1:23:54.720 --> 1:23:57.680]  You can with Great Wall of Fire Fireplace Grates.

[1:24:20.440 --> 1:24:27.720]  You can watch a factory of robots being controlled by wireless internet commands, but if you
[1:24:27.720 --> 1:24:31.200]  were a person just 200 years ago and you saw that, you'd think it was magic.
[1:24:31.200 --> 1:24:35.360]  You wouldn't even know really what the machines were or what was controlling them.
[1:24:35.360 --> 1:24:40.080]  So for that person, it would be spiritual or it would be something of a spirit.
[1:24:40.080 --> 1:24:44.480]  And it's similar to how ducks and butterflies and many other species of animals know how
[1:24:44.480 --> 1:24:48.240]  to fly thousands and thousands of miles back to the exact place where they were born.
[1:24:48.240 --> 1:24:52.600]  They're following magnetic lines, they have magnetic cells in their brains.
[1:24:52.600 --> 1:24:55.480]  We now know side-diflutes are going on, but there's even a lot more than that.
[1:24:55.480 --> 1:24:59.080]  So when we talk about the spirit, we're talking about all the dark matter.
[1:24:59.080 --> 1:25:02.080]  We're talking about all the things you don't understand, but we know it's there.
[1:25:02.080 --> 1:25:06.200]  And just like you can have a bunch of robots working off the wireless system, that's what's
[1:25:06.200 --> 1:25:12.160]  going on with this satanic transmission that's working through people and that's how this
[1:25:12.160 --> 1:25:16.640]  entity behind it all is able to direct it because it is a consciousness manipulated
[1:25:16.640 --> 1:25:19.920]  in a space-time continuum.
[1:25:19.920 --> 1:25:26.480]  As of 54 days out, the globalist child molesting devil worshipers know they're in trouble
[1:25:26.480 --> 1:25:29.720]  and they know Trump's going to win in the landslides they're saying they can test the
[1:25:29.720 --> 1:25:33.440]  election and plunge the country to civil war and they're throwing hack attacks at them
[1:25:33.440 --> 1:25:36.920]  for wars, dirty tricks, attempts to shut us down.
[1:25:36.920 --> 1:25:38.320]  It's incredible.
[1:25:38.320 --> 1:25:43.040]  That's why now more than ever, your financial support at mforwardshore.com is critical.
[1:25:43.040 --> 1:25:44.040]  It's what keeps us in the game.
[1:25:44.040 --> 1:25:47.200]  We've only got a few months of back up.
[1:25:47.200 --> 1:25:50.680]  If money wasn't coming in, we'd be shut down and that's not good.
[1:25:50.680 --> 1:25:55.560]  We need to have extra money in our coffers, people to expand in this home stretch, not
[1:25:55.560 --> 1:25:56.560]  just contract.
[1:25:56.560 --> 1:26:01.160]  We're winning, but these scumbags aren't going to give us the victory without a fight.
[1:26:01.160 --> 1:26:03.760]  So I know you're going to step up at mforwardstore.com.
[1:26:03.760 --> 1:26:07.200]  We've got free shipping on a bunch of our best selling items, a bunch of new items that
[1:26:07.200 --> 1:26:08.200]  came back in stock.

[1:26:17.200 --> 1:26:18.720]  God bless you all.
[1:26:18.720 --> 1:26:23.600]  It was in the telecommunications act of 1996 that all new cell phones would track your
[1:26:23.600 --> 1:26:25.520]  GPS location.
[1:26:25.520 --> 1:26:31.160]  I read from the federal law and listeners couldn't believe me because that was un-American.
[1:26:31.160 --> 1:26:37.120]  Now the media admits that almost every app and every company that are on Apple and Androids,
[1:26:37.120 --> 1:26:41.680]  don't just track your location, but your surfing history, where you go, who you talk
[1:26:41.680 --> 1:26:46.680]  to, your relationships and they all share the data with each other of what you're doing
[1:26:46.680 --> 1:26:52.320]  on the apps as well, including having apps turn on and listen to what you're saying just
[1:26:52.320 --> 1:26:58.440]  like Siri or Alexa Do and then putting databases, transcripts of everything you say into those
[1:26:58.440 --> 1:27:00.520]  systems to be saved forever.
[1:27:00.520 --> 1:27:04.720]  Your phone is spying on you and companies are generating secret surveillance scores based
[1:27:04.720 --> 1:27:05.820]  on information.
[1:27:05.820 --> 1:27:09.000]  This is the global Chinese Communist Social Credit Score.
[1:27:09.000 --> 1:27:14.840]  Get your protection privacy pockets at mforwardstore.com and cut Big Brother off dead in his filthy
[1:27:14.840 --> 1:27:22.120]  tracks, mforwardstore.com.
[1:27:22.120 --> 1:27:42.120]  Start listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:27:42.120 --> 1:27:43.120]  Welcome back.
[1:27:43.120 --> 1:27:44.120]  I'm your host Alex Jones.
[1:27:44.120 --> 1:27:49.120]  There have been some incredible COVID-19 developments, really the biggest yet on so many fronts.
[1:27:49.120 --> 1:27:55.120]  I'll hit those next segment ahead of Dr. Sherry Tenpenny, a leading medical doctor, who's
[1:27:55.120 --> 1:27:59.120]  been exposing the dangers of vaccines for more than two decades.
[1:27:59.120 --> 1:28:03.120]  Maybe they're reviewing her for 25 years or so.
[1:28:03.120 --> 1:28:07.520]  She'll be joining us coming up in the third hour.
[1:28:07.520 --> 1:28:11.200]  All right, all of these stories tie together.
[1:28:11.200 --> 1:28:15.920]  Julian Assange and the extradition trial going on in the old Bailey Wick in the United
[1:28:15.920 --> 1:28:21.080]  Kingdom where they let Muslims out of jail for running dozens of kidnapped little girls,
[1:28:21.080 --> 1:28:27.080]  some of which they kill, but where Tommy Robinson gets years in prison for exposing the pedophiles
[1:28:27.080 --> 1:28:32.520]  and where Julian Assange is facing extradition after what is it, seven, eight years of solitary
[1:28:32.520 --> 1:28:42.720]  confinement for doing what Gail Ellsberg, the Pentagon Papers did, doing what Woodward
[1:28:42.720 --> 1:28:49.280]  Bernstein did exposing secret stuff, but the old days from the San Diego newspaper to expose
[1:28:49.280 --> 1:28:52.960]  the Gulf of Tongan being staged because the sailors got off and said it was staged just
[1:28:52.960 --> 1:28:57.560]  a month after it happened, they got awards for that.
[1:28:57.560 --> 1:29:05.440]  But in the year 2020, what was the old saying that somebody wrote on a prison ship wall
[1:29:05.440 --> 1:29:15.680]  so the author's unknown, when freedom fails, the best men rot in filthy jails, and those
[1:29:15.680 --> 1:29:23.400]  that cry to peas appeased are hung by those they tried to please.
[1:29:23.400 --> 1:29:33.960]  When freedom fails, the best men rot in filthy jails, while those that cry to peas appease
[1:29:33.960 --> 1:29:36.520]  are hung by those they tried to please.
[1:29:36.520 --> 1:29:44.720]  But to counter that melancholy quote I like Mark Twain, in the beginning a patriot's
[1:29:44.720 --> 1:29:49.120]  a scarce man hated, feared, and scorned, but in time when his cause succeeds, the timid
[1:29:49.120 --> 1:29:55.920]  joined him because then it cost nothing to be a patriot.
[1:29:55.920 --> 1:30:00.680]  Julian Assange did us a favor, he showed us what our military had given him, was not
[1:30:00.680 --> 1:30:08.920]  who they said gave us the information.
[1:30:08.920 --> 1:30:16.240]  It was not Chelsea Manning, and now Trump's able to get us out of these wars that the
[1:30:16.240 --> 1:30:22.920]  military supports but the brass don't want because they were bought and paid for almost
[1:30:22.920 --> 1:30:25.520]  all of them except for General Flynn.
[1:30:25.520 --> 1:30:31.120]  So all of this ties together right now, how do these articles tie together?
[1:30:31.120 --> 1:30:36.680]  Julian Assange, warned by a judge of the outburst during an extradition trial, how dare you
[1:30:36.680 --> 1:30:38.160]  speak scum?
[1:30:38.160 --> 1:30:49.040]  How does that tie together with Edward Snowden, who exposed all the CIA, illegal, domestic
[1:30:49.040 --> 1:30:56.840]  spying, international spying, on Joe Rogan, giving a hat tip to yours truly, that we really
[1:30:56.840 --> 1:31:01.520]  hammered exposing the Patriot Act and now we've been silenced, now we were the tip of
[1:31:01.520 --> 1:31:03.080]  the spear on that.
[1:31:03.080 --> 1:31:12.080]  And how does that tie together with high school players suspended from team after having thin
[1:31:12.080 --> 1:31:18.920]  blue line and thin red line flags on the 9-11 anniversary, and how does that tie into this?
[1:31:18.920 --> 1:31:30.480]  Mayor ordered officers to remove thin blue line mask at 9-11 memorial because thin blue
[1:31:30.480 --> 1:31:32.000]  live masks are political.
[1:31:32.000 --> 1:31:35.920]  You see, everybody else can be political and Black Lives Matter can march, but you can't
[1:31:35.920 --> 1:31:41.560]  have the symbol you want saying supporting the police because supporting your fraternity
[1:31:41.560 --> 1:31:45.080]  and your local system of the people, that's not allowed.
[1:31:45.080 --> 1:31:51.280]  And all of our speeches, just like in big tech, everything censored that's good, everything's
[1:31:51.280 --> 1:31:57.080]  promoted that's bad, and on the grassroots level by the mayors that are under UN globalist
[1:31:57.080 --> 1:31:58.960]  control, the police are silenced.
[1:31:58.960 --> 1:32:01.160]  What does it all deal with?
[1:32:01.160 --> 1:32:04.040]  The muzzling, the silencing, the American people.
[1:32:04.040 --> 1:32:14.280]  Stanford University and the Hoover Institute, as Americana elitist as you can get, but establishment
[1:32:14.280 --> 1:32:21.880]  is out with a speech, have some fellows on of the institute with the fact that the UN
[1:32:21.880 --> 1:32:26.640]  exaggerated COVID-19 and that the lockdown is causing all this death, that's banned.
[1:32:26.640 --> 1:32:33.400]  And YouTube says, do it again to Stanford, we'll ban all your channels.
[1:32:33.400 --> 1:32:34.480]  The UN is in command.
[1:32:34.480 --> 1:32:35.600]  You understand?
[1:32:35.600 --> 1:32:42.320]  I'll break your arm next time you do that, you dirty American.
[1:32:42.320 --> 1:32:50.880]  That banned video is at banned.video in the special banned video section.
[1:32:50.880 --> 1:32:56.280]  And it's just very friendly common sense with statistics and numbers with a couple of academic
[1:32:56.280 --> 1:33:02.520]  high-level professors laying out that basically, yeah, you can get COVID, it's very rare.
[1:33:02.520 --> 1:33:05.600]  If you have vitamin deficiencies, you can die.
[1:33:05.600 --> 1:33:10.560]  But that it's killing millions from starvation and millions from suicide, and it's really
[1:33:10.560 --> 1:33:11.560]  bad.
[1:33:11.560 --> 1:33:12.920]  It's really uncommon knowledge.
[1:33:12.920 --> 1:33:17.840]  That show banned.
[1:33:17.840 --> 1:33:19.240]  So that's where we are now.
[1:33:19.240 --> 1:33:20.240]  Here's the video.
[1:33:20.240 --> 1:33:25.880]  High school football players suspended from team after waving thin blue line and thin
[1:33:25.880 --> 1:33:32.000]  red line flags for supporting firefighters and police.
[1:33:32.000 --> 1:33:33.880]  And they said it's political.
[1:33:33.880 --> 1:33:36.120]  See that's a twisting of the First Amendment.
[1:33:36.120 --> 1:33:38.880]  Congress shall make no law respecting and establishing a religion or prohibiting the
[1:33:38.880 --> 1:33:42.640]  free exercise thereof or the freedom of the press or the right of assembly and petition
[1:33:42.640 --> 1:33:46.200]  the government for redress and grievances.
[1:33:46.200 --> 1:33:47.760]  Congress doesn't have jurisdiction over religion.
[1:33:47.760 --> 1:33:52.880]  That doesn't mean you can't say a religious thing in your commencement speech or at the
[1:33:52.880 --> 1:33:54.360]  Christmas party or wherever you want.
[1:33:54.360 --> 1:33:57.720]  And it doesn't mean that you can't have sanctioned American flags.
[1:33:57.720 --> 1:34:01.440]  Now they're saying, oh, it's not just religion you can't have, it's politics.
[1:34:01.440 --> 1:34:05.720]  And the American flag is political when the globalists are saying take down the anthem,
[1:34:05.720 --> 1:34:10.760]  take down the flag, take down the press, take down the police because they're involved
[1:34:10.760 --> 1:34:12.640]  in a globalist takeover.
[1:34:12.640 --> 1:34:17.040]  And the federal government, the CDC is having 13 week courses teaching that America shouldn't
[1:34:17.040 --> 1:34:18.040]  even exist.
[1:34:18.040 --> 1:34:22.640]  And Trump orders it shut down and they say F you because there's a mutiny of these criminal
[1:34:22.640 --> 1:34:24.920]  traders working for foreign powers.
[1:34:24.920 --> 1:34:30.200]  So they're not just involved in sedition, they're involved in treason.
[1:34:30.200 --> 1:34:31.200]  This is it.
[1:34:31.200 --> 1:34:32.200]  The move to take us down.
[1:34:32.200 --> 1:34:37.000]  Here's the video of the thought crime and the suspended players and the suspended students
[1:34:37.000 --> 1:34:38.840]  for waving the evil American flag.
[1:34:38.840 --> 1:34:39.840]  Here it is.
[1:34:39.840 --> 1:35:00.200]  Oh my gosh, they're waving American flags and the police flags.
[1:35:00.200 --> 1:35:07.480]  Now they took a knee if they said they hate America, they stayed inside for the national
[1:35:07.480 --> 1:35:08.480]  anthem.
[1:35:08.480 --> 1:35:09.480]  They'd be heroes.
[1:35:09.480 --> 1:35:13.360]  But oh, you're not allowed to do this now.
[1:35:13.360 --> 1:35:16.360]  Now there's an article just went live on info wars dot com.
[1:35:16.360 --> 1:35:19.840]  We'll tell you about it when we come back.
[1:35:19.840 --> 1:35:23.760]  Edward Snowden talks Alex Jones with Joe Rogan in new interview.
[1:35:23.760 --> 1:35:29.520]  Snowden gives a hat tip to Alex Jones for trailblazing the exposure of the post 9 11
[1:35:29.520 --> 1:35:34.480]  state Patriot Act legislation.
[1:35:34.480 --> 1:35:35.480]  Patriot act.
[1:35:35.480 --> 1:35:36.960]  We'll have that word there.
[1:35:36.960 --> 1:35:42.200]  So that's important because see the president doesn't run from me.
[1:35:42.200 --> 1:35:44.080]  Snowden doesn't run from me.
[1:35:44.080 --> 1:35:47.480]  All the real activists and people that actually did stuff don't run from me.
[1:35:47.480 --> 1:35:52.320]  It's just the grass roots that we've awakened that still thinks milk toast is going to get
[1:35:52.320 --> 1:35:53.320]  us ahead.
[1:35:53.320 --> 1:35:56.480]  That still thinks playing in the middle is going to get ahead that, oh, you won't be
[1:35:56.480 --> 1:36:01.120]  censored as long as you don't promote Alex Jones or info wars when you're going to be
[1:36:01.120 --> 1:36:02.120]  censored next.
[1:36:02.120 --> 1:36:08.560]  If you don't stand up for info wars, they don't get that.
[1:36:08.560 --> 1:36:09.560]  They don't understand that.
[1:36:09.560 --> 1:36:10.560]  But it's okay.
[1:36:10.560 --> 1:36:11.560]  They're followers.
[1:36:11.560 --> 1:36:12.560]  We're leaders.
[1:36:12.560 --> 1:36:16.920]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're leaders in this fight.
[1:36:16.920 --> 1:36:18.400]  We're leaders in the future.
[1:36:18.400 --> 1:36:22.080]  It's not our job to be accepted up front.
[1:36:22.080 --> 1:36:28.520]  It's our job to show the way like icebreakers and to go through in through and beyond.
[1:36:28.520 --> 1:36:29.520]  That's our mission.
[1:36:29.520 --> 1:36:36.400]  If you're looking for cupcakes and sweetie cake time and easy times.
[1:36:36.400 --> 1:36:37.560]  That leads to North Korea.
[1:36:37.560 --> 1:36:38.760]  That leads to Nazi Germany.
[1:36:38.760 --> 1:36:40.360]  That leads to Mao Zedong.
[1:36:40.360 --> 1:36:42.360]  That leads to Joseph Stalin and V.I.
[1:36:42.360 --> 1:36:43.360]  Lenin.
[1:36:43.360 --> 1:36:48.640]  But if you want to change the world, stand up as George Arwell said, he said in a world
[1:36:48.640 --> 1:36:52.840]  of universal deceit telling the truth is a revolutionary act and admit that info wars
[1:36:52.840 --> 1:36:53.840]  has been right.
[1:36:53.840 --> 1:36:58.400]  Admit that info wars is show place and admit that info wars needs to be championed, not
[1:36:58.400 --> 1:36:59.400]  pissed on.
[1:36:59.400 --> 1:37:03.160]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, we'll be right back.
[1:37:03.160 --> 1:37:05.360]  You are the core of the resistance worldwide.
[1:37:05.360 --> 1:37:06.360]  You might be brown.
[1:37:06.360 --> 1:37:07.360]  You might be white.
[1:37:07.360 --> 1:37:08.360]  You might be pink.
[1:37:08.360 --> 1:37:09.360]  You might be black.
[1:37:09.360 --> 1:37:10.360]  You might be old.
[1:37:10.360 --> 1:37:11.360]  You might be young.
[1:37:11.360 --> 1:37:12.360]  You might be male.
[1:37:12.360 --> 1:37:13.360]  You might be female.
[1:37:13.360 --> 1:37:15.360]  But if you love justice, you're with God and you love victory.
[1:37:15.360 --> 1:37:45.320]  We defeat the bloodless together.
[1:37:45.320 --> 1:37:50.160]  From the beginning, it's been about creating monopolies, cornering markets, and making
[1:37:50.160 --> 1:37:51.480]  humans obsolete.
[1:37:51.480 --> 1:37:55.240]  The same people brought us baby formula that doesn't have enough protein fat in it to make
[1:37:55.240 --> 1:37:56.240]  your child's brain small.
[1:37:56.240 --> 1:38:00.280]  The same people that said put babies in cribs separate from their mothers.
[1:38:00.280 --> 1:38:02.640]  The lower IQs about 20 points on average as well.
[1:38:02.640 --> 1:38:08.160]  These are hardcore eugenicists, survival of the fittest, social Darwinists, grow up world,
[1:38:08.160 --> 1:38:12.960]  admit the truth, with being soft as much, and letting these bloodless run your lives.
[1:38:12.960 --> 1:38:14.460]  They are your mortal enemies.
[1:38:14.460 --> 1:38:19.360]  They want you dead, do you understand that?
[1:38:19.360 --> 1:38:27.240]  In Germany, in Australia, in Canada, and now even in Ohio, every blue state, every blue
[1:38:27.240 --> 1:38:33.800]  city is announcing that they are establishing emergency COVID centers for people that refuse
[1:38:33.800 --> 1:38:39.000]  to be tested or people that are tested but refuse to stay in place while the results
[1:38:39.000 --> 1:38:42.760]  are coming back or those that supposedly break quarantine.
[1:38:42.760 --> 1:38:47.760]  This of course is all based on the tests that are over 90% fraudulent and were designed
[1:38:47.760 --> 1:38:49.400]  to be so.
[1:38:49.400 --> 1:38:51.560]  This is a power grab.
[1:38:51.560 --> 1:38:55.000]  The world government globalist system is in trouble.
[1:38:55.000 --> 1:38:58.360]  All over the planet, free peoples are trying to pull out of it.
[1:38:58.360 --> 1:39:04.200]  And every blue area, I use the term blue as if in the US for blue for Democrats, red for
[1:39:04.200 --> 1:39:09.000]  Republicans, is basically globalist or communist and authoritarian.
[1:39:09.000 --> 1:39:13.200]  And they are using this as their cover for an authoritarian takeover because they know
[1:39:13.200 --> 1:39:14.200]  the world's waiting to them.
[1:39:14.200 --> 1:39:19.960]  It's a very simple equation, it's illegal, we must resist it.
[1:39:19.960 --> 1:39:23.400]  Dependency, domestication.
[1:39:23.400 --> 1:39:29.560]  In the real world, ignorance is not bliss, it's enslavement and it's death.
[1:39:29.560 --> 1:39:33.200]  The globalists are teaching us all that we're non-essential.
[1:39:33.200 --> 1:39:36.920]  With automation, they're bringing in a world that doesn't power humanity but makes us
[1:39:36.920 --> 1:39:37.920]  obsolete.
[1:39:37.920 --> 1:39:40.320]  We're not obsolete, we don't have to listen to them.
[1:39:40.320 --> 1:39:43.920]  We can farm again, we can garden, we can become self-sufficient.
[1:39:43.920 --> 1:39:49.520]  But first we've got to learn to stand up politically for ourselves and we need to become self-sufficient.
[1:39:49.520 --> 1:39:54.240]  That begins with water filtration to take control of that from the globalists and their
[1:39:54.240 --> 1:39:57.640]  fluoride and their dumbing down agenda and with storable food.
[1:39:57.640 --> 1:40:03.760]  And we have it all, the highest quality, the highest rated at the lowest prices at m4store.com.
[1:40:03.760 --> 1:40:05.200]  Take action now.
[1:40:05.200 --> 1:40:08.040]  You cannot lose unless you do not take action.
[1:40:08.040 --> 1:40:12.680]  We have the best water filtration, the best storable food and it funds the m4store.
[1:40:12.680 --> 1:40:14.880]  Take action now while you still can.
[1:40:14.880 --> 1:40:15.880]  Become prepared.
[1:40:15.880 --> 1:40:21.520]  Become self-sufficient now at m4store.com.
[1:40:21.520 --> 1:40:24.120]  The party was not going to go on forever.
[1:40:24.120 --> 1:40:29.400]  All the welfare, all the entertainment, all the decadence was only designed to get people
[1:40:29.400 --> 1:40:35.600]  domesticated, dumbed down, selfish and, most importantly, isolated.
[1:40:35.600 --> 1:40:41.160]  And now that most of the population is selfish, isolated and very, very dumbed down and ignorant,
[1:40:41.160 --> 1:40:44.320]  the New World Order is facing its move.
[1:40:44.320 --> 1:40:49.360]  And they are now going to weaponize the giant masses of foolish followers who believe they
[1:40:49.360 --> 1:40:53.920]  just follow orders, they'll get another little piece of green like when the chicken pecks
[1:40:53.920 --> 1:40:54.920]  at the lever.
[1:40:54.920 --> 1:40:59.000]  But all that they're really going to get is the noose typing around their foolish neck.
[1:40:59.000 --> 1:41:03.840]  Those of us that are aware and informed can laugh at the mass of slaves, but remember,
[1:41:03.840 --> 1:41:08.520]  they're a dangerous weapon appointed at our throats, and so we've got to save them to
[1:41:08.520 --> 1:41:09.520]  save ourselves.
[1:41:09.520 --> 1:41:13.760]  And to do that, we've got to expose the globalists, we've got to take it to them politically
[1:41:13.760 --> 1:41:17.960]  and absolutely annihilate them with the crimes that they've actually committed.
[1:41:17.960 --> 1:41:30.240]  Close the enemy now.
[1:41:30.240 --> 1:41:37.360]  We are drugged out, we are following other people's opinions, we are controlled by the
[1:41:37.360 --> 1:41:38.360]  media.
[1:41:38.360 --> 1:41:44.440]  Today it all changes, this reality has been forced upon us, it is a choice, just like
[1:41:44.440 --> 1:41:46.080]  what I said slavery is a choice.
[1:41:46.080 --> 1:41:50.960]  Einstein says the depth of insanity is doing the same thing, expecting a different result.
[1:41:50.960 --> 1:41:55.080]  So we keep on saying, I hate you, I hate you, you, you, you, how are we going to get a different
[1:41:55.080 --> 1:41:56.080]  result out of hate?
[1:41:56.080 --> 1:42:00.520]  Why don't we just try love, why don't we just try love?
[1:42:00.520 --> 1:42:04.480]  We have the resources for a peaceful world.
[1:42:04.480 --> 1:42:09.760]  You know, sometimes you need some crazy mother to change something, Steve Jobs is crazy,
[1:42:09.760 --> 1:42:14.040]  now we all know Steve Jobs phones, they say Trump's crazy, they say I'm crazy, but I'm
[1:42:14.040 --> 1:42:22.040]  here to show love, it's a bigger plan and I'm just doing what the universe told me.
[1:42:22.040 --> 1:42:34.520]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God, it's Alex Jones.
[1:42:34.520 --> 1:42:36.400]  Are you afraid of losing your audience?
[1:42:36.400 --> 1:42:37.400]  Yeah.
[1:42:37.400 --> 1:42:42.120]  I told you I'm only afraid of God, I'm only afraid of my daddy, God.
[1:42:42.120 --> 1:42:48.480]  I haven't been 15 years, I'm telling you, God is showing that you can have your own
[1:42:48.480 --> 1:42:50.320]  thoughts, bro.
[1:42:50.320 --> 1:42:53.120]  I've been canceled before, there was canceled culture.
[1:42:53.120 --> 1:42:57.040]  Who told you that my career would be over?
[1:42:57.040 --> 1:43:00.840]  The same people that are telling you that you can't have a right to say who you will
[1:43:00.840 --> 1:43:05.080]  vote for, those people will be soon to take Jesus out of school.
[1:43:05.080 --> 1:43:10.760]  Those people will be soon to remove Jesus, period, from America, which is the Bible
[1:43:10.760 --> 1:43:11.760]  belt.
[1:43:11.760 --> 1:43:12.760]  Those people will be soon.
[1:43:12.760 --> 1:43:16.760]  Man, come on, man, I ain't finna go Alex Jones level with y'all, man, come on, man,
[1:43:16.760 --> 1:43:24.040]  with your own, like, wake up, wake up, Mr. West, wake up culture, wake up, everybody
[1:43:24.040 --> 1:43:28.760]  think they so woke, but they following the rules of what woke supposed to be.
[1:43:28.760 --> 1:43:33.000]  That's right, and he said that about a year ago, they're now pulling statues of Jesus
[1:43:33.000 --> 1:43:37.040]  down all over the world.
[1:43:37.040 --> 1:43:45.080]  And Julian Assange, who's an award-winning journalist, we should be getting Pulitzer prizes.
[1:43:45.080 --> 1:43:51.920]  He has been locked up for what, seven, eight years, been in solitary confinement for three
[1:43:51.920 --> 1:43:58.880]  or longer, and Edward Snowden is in exile.
[1:43:58.880 --> 1:44:03.720]  We need to repeal the Patriot Act, it was used against President Trump, it's not used
[1:44:03.720 --> 1:44:06.160]  against the real terrorist.
[1:44:06.160 --> 1:44:11.080]  This is what Edward Snowden had to say on the new Joe Rogan podcast, it was just released
[1:44:11.080 --> 1:44:14.160]  here in Austin today, here it is.
[1:44:14.160 --> 1:44:18.120]  First of all, congratulations on the recent ruling.
[1:44:18.120 --> 1:44:22.040]  Was the Ninth District Court of Appeals, is that what it was?
[1:44:22.040 --> 1:44:30.040]  It said that what you exposed with the warrantless wiretapping was in fact illegal, and there
[1:44:30.040 --> 1:44:33.680]  are many people that are calling for you to be pardoned now.
[1:44:33.680 --> 1:44:40.120]  Yeah, so much has happened, this ruling, this is actually not the first time the federal
[1:44:40.120 --> 1:44:45.160]  government has, or the appeals courts have struck down some of the federal surveillance
[1:44:45.160 --> 1:44:50.400]  programs as unlawful, but this one is really important because it happened from an appeals
[1:44:50.400 --> 1:44:56.160]  court, it wasn't from a single judge, it was from a panel of judges.
[1:44:56.160 --> 1:45:03.920]  And what they had ruled was that the NSA's bulk collection of Americans phone records
[1:45:03.920 --> 1:45:04.920]  was illegal.
[1:45:04.920 --> 1:45:12.120]  And this is the very first sort of mass surveillance program that I and the journalists, really
[1:45:12.120 --> 1:45:18.840]  that the news was broken back in 2013, so this is a huge victory for privacy rights.
[1:45:18.840 --> 1:45:24.360]  What it means is, there was this provision of the Patriot Act, like remember the Patriot
[1:45:24.360 --> 1:45:26.600]  Act, remember like a zillion years ago?
[1:45:26.600 --> 1:45:27.600]  I do.
[1:45:27.600 --> 1:45:31.720]  Everybody was like, Patriot Act, Patriot Act, you friend Alex Jones, you know, I think
[1:45:31.720 --> 1:45:32.720]  he was worried about the Patriot Act.
[1:45:32.720 --> 1:45:37.040]  It's a terrible name, there's a real problem with that name, because if you're against
[1:45:37.040 --> 1:45:42.680]  the Patriot Act, it's like against babies, it's like this is the pro-baby act, but meanwhile
[1:45:42.680 --> 1:45:47.760]  pro-baby act, they get to look through your email.
[1:45:47.760 --> 1:45:51.440]  So again, that's a hat tip for Snowden to say, you know, Alex Jones was against it,
[1:45:51.440 --> 1:45:56.640]  we trailblazed exposing it, because we're not trying to become the establishment.
[1:45:56.640 --> 1:46:01.840]  We're not trying to get into Hollywood, get into DC, get into New York, we're trying to
[1:46:01.840 --> 1:46:05.160]  change the world for the average person.
[1:46:05.160 --> 1:46:11.040]  And so as soon as we can get all these other trailblazers to hat tip, we hat tip back to
[1:46:11.040 --> 1:46:16.080]  them, then we become the new mainstream and reverse the tyranny we've seen.
[1:46:16.080 --> 1:46:20.640]  What we're promoting is mainstream decency and justice and not being spied on and having
[1:46:20.640 --> 1:46:24.280]  free speech and having a level playing field and justice.
[1:46:24.280 --> 1:46:31.240]  What Soros and the globalists are bringing you as a war on journalist, the biggest blight,
[1:46:31.240 --> 1:46:41.840]  the biggest black mark, the biggest yellow stripe is a better term, down Trump's belly,
[1:46:41.840 --> 1:46:46.920]  is that the intelligence agency say, sir, you can't let us saunge out because then that
[1:46:46.920 --> 1:46:48.440]  will encourage other leakers.
[1:46:48.440 --> 1:46:52.360]  All the left does is leak and they leak false information.
[1:46:52.360 --> 1:46:58.080]  They leak way worse than Snowden or Assange did, but they leak stuff the system didn't
[1:46:58.080 --> 1:47:01.560]  want out, the corruption, the protected stuff under whistleblowing.
[1:47:01.560 --> 1:47:04.960]  If something's criminally legal, it's protected under whistleblower.
[1:47:04.960 --> 1:47:10.440]  So pardon Snowden, the federal courts already said he was in the right.
[1:47:10.440 --> 1:47:17.360]  He was exposing illegal clandestine programs that were spying on Congress, on the lawmakers.
[1:47:17.360 --> 1:47:22.400]  And pardon Julian Assange, they sent in two CIA operatives.
[1:47:22.400 --> 1:47:23.400]  He double teamed them.
[1:47:23.400 --> 1:47:26.640]  The guy deserves a medal and a man having a sex with women is bad.
[1:47:26.640 --> 1:47:27.640]  I mean, I get it.
[1:47:27.640 --> 1:47:28.640]  I'm a father, whatever.
[1:47:28.640 --> 1:47:33.120]  The point is, Netflix says pedophilia is okay, but a dude having two chicks is bad.
[1:47:33.120 --> 1:47:34.120]  They were CIA.
[1:47:34.120 --> 1:47:37.960]  They said, well, he didn't say he wasn't going to wear a condom.
[1:47:37.960 --> 1:47:39.600]  We were consensual, but it wasn't a condom.
[1:47:39.600 --> 1:47:42.120]  And now all these years later, he's locked up over that.
[1:47:42.120 --> 1:47:43.680]  That's why they've still got him locked up.
[1:47:43.680 --> 1:47:51.960]  And now all these fake charges of espionage, when it was as Oliver Stone came out and somebody
[1:47:51.960 --> 1:47:58.640]  knows that it was a certain DNC staffer, reportedly, that released that information, got gunned
[1:47:58.640 --> 1:48:00.320]  down and shot in the back.
[1:48:00.320 --> 1:48:02.280]  So they don't want that coming out.
[1:48:02.280 --> 1:48:05.320]  It's not the Russians and nothing against Russians.
[1:48:05.320 --> 1:48:07.480]  They got good mathematicians, good scientists.
[1:48:07.480 --> 1:48:08.480]  They can build spaceships.
[1:48:08.480 --> 1:48:11.880]  They can build weapons, you know, whatever, okay?
[1:48:11.880 --> 1:48:17.480]  The Russians are not sophisticated, like the Chinese are taken over.
[1:48:17.480 --> 1:48:20.720]  The Chinese have eight-hour lunch, and I go back to this.
[1:48:20.720 --> 1:48:26.640]  If the Russians had done 5% of what the Chinese have done, the communists, with the traders
[1:48:26.640 --> 1:48:31.400]  in our country, then I would be absolutely on a war footing with Russia.
[1:48:31.400 --> 1:48:33.680]  Russia's not the problem.
[1:48:33.680 --> 1:48:34.680]  It's a problem.
[1:48:34.680 --> 1:48:38.240]  If the globalists could get us to start a damn war with them, could you saw what happened
[1:48:38.240 --> 1:48:41.960]  to Napoleon and Hitler with his little escapades with the Russians?
[1:48:41.960 --> 1:48:45.440]  If it wasn't for Napoleon and Hitler, there would probably be about 500 million Russians
[1:48:45.440 --> 1:48:46.440]  now.
[1:48:46.440 --> 1:48:49.440]  People would go, oh, there's only like 180 million Russians, boy, they can't even get
[1:48:49.440 --> 1:48:50.440]  their population together.
[1:48:50.440 --> 1:48:53.680]  Well, yeah, only because they lose a third of it at every one of these big wars.
[1:48:53.680 --> 1:48:59.600]  I mean, I know the reality, folks, think about a third of the country dead.
[1:48:59.600 --> 1:49:01.480]  Germany lost more than a third.
[1:49:01.480 --> 1:49:06.200]  Did that's a war?
[1:49:06.200 --> 1:49:12.040]  And the Rothschild sat back and laughed while the Germans and the Russians killed 40 million
[1:49:12.040 --> 1:49:15.840]  of each other.
[1:49:15.840 --> 1:49:19.000]  Just like the same globalists want blacks and whites to kill each other now, and we're
[1:49:19.000 --> 1:49:21.200]  all dumbasses if we play along.
[1:49:21.200 --> 1:49:25.160]  All right, we've got Dr. Sherry Tenpenny coming up.
[1:49:25.160 --> 1:49:28.200]  We've already covered a ton of news, and I'm feeling really good about this broadcast,
[1:49:28.200 --> 1:49:30.960]  but I said I'd hit COVID-19 right now, but it's okay.
[1:49:30.960 --> 1:49:35.200]  I missed it because I'll cover it with Dr. Sherry Tenpenny, and it's the biggest developments
[1:49:35.200 --> 1:49:36.200]  yet.
[1:49:36.200 --> 1:49:40.560]  Separately, ladies and gentlemen, we got some big specials running right now, and they're
[1:49:40.560 --> 1:49:43.840]  trying to shut us down right now, and our supply chains are breaking down.
[1:49:43.840 --> 1:49:45.680]  We've got all the storeable food in stock.
[1:49:45.680 --> 1:49:51.720]  We've got all the air filtration, water filtration and supplements and books and films and t-shirts.
[1:49:51.720 --> 1:49:54.880]  Anything you hear us plugging, we have ready to ship within days to you.
[1:49:54.880 --> 1:49:58.080]  Food takes a week to two weeks because there's a lot of specialty diets and specialty orders,
[1:49:58.080 --> 1:50:00.240]  and they just put that in there as a cushion.
[1:50:00.240 --> 1:50:04.560]  Get your storeable food orders in before the next big rush, even if Trump gets back in,
[1:50:04.560 --> 1:50:05.800]  it's going to be a rough road, folks.
[1:50:05.800 --> 1:50:07.520]  I would advise everybody get storeable food.
[1:50:07.520 --> 1:50:09.920]  We have the best company with the highest quality food at the lowest price you're going
[1:50:09.920 --> 1:50:10.920]  to find.
[1:50:10.920 --> 1:50:13.240]  You can pay, again, three, four, five, six times more.
[1:50:13.240 --> 1:50:16.280]  Maybe get food that tastes better or is better, but it costs way more.
[1:50:16.280 --> 1:50:20.000]  It doesn't even have as good a packaging, and packaging and durability lasting up to
[1:50:20.000 --> 1:50:22.440]  25 years is what's key.
[1:50:22.440 --> 1:50:27.720]  So, infowarstore.com or triple eight, two, five, three, three, one, three, nine.
[1:50:27.720 --> 1:50:31.240]  DNA Force Plus is the number one thing I'd be taking for overall immune system in your
[1:50:31.240 --> 1:50:33.560]  body and boosting your defenses.
[1:50:33.560 --> 1:50:39.760]  The PQQ, the CoQ, the Gen, the Organic, Rishi, the Astragalus, and the LFATP does is incredible
[1:50:39.760 --> 1:50:41.920]  ancient Pete Apple extract.
[1:50:41.920 --> 1:50:48.360]  I would get that 50% off plus free shipping, 1776 for all the apparel, the t-shirts you
[1:50:48.360 --> 1:50:53.440]  name it, free shipping, and eight-pack power stacks selling out, 60% off with free shipping,
[1:50:53.440 --> 1:50:58.240]  X2 back in stock, 50% off, Ultimate Fish Oil back in stock, 50% off.
[1:50:58.240 --> 1:51:03.120]  It's all at infowarstore.com or triple eight, two, five, three, three, one, three, nine.
[1:51:03.120 --> 1:51:08.760]  I need your support with what's going on to gauge whether I stay the same size, whether
[1:51:08.760 --> 1:51:14.280]  I expand or whether I begin contracting because we've never contracted in all these years
[1:51:14.280 --> 1:51:19.600]  and I'm at that crossroads and I come hat in hand for you and my own future and all
[1:51:19.600 --> 1:51:24.040]  of us together and just say, do you really want the enemy to be able to shut us down?
[1:51:24.040 --> 1:51:25.040]  No.
[1:51:25.040 --> 1:51:26.040]  Money is the coin of the realm.
[1:51:26.040 --> 1:51:31.000]  I can hold the enemy off and I can build incredible things and I can do so much more.
[1:51:31.000 --> 1:51:36.280]  I just need the money and we've got the products you already need infowarstore.com.
[1:51:36.280 --> 1:51:37.280]  You need storeable food.
[1:51:37.280 --> 1:51:38.280]  You need water filtration.
[1:51:38.280 --> 1:51:39.280]  We've got the best.
[1:51:39.280 --> 1:51:41.400]  The water filtration is the best lowest price.
[1:51:41.400 --> 1:51:44.320]  You can't get better gravity fed filter for twice the price.
[1:51:44.320 --> 1:51:46.840]  I mean, the ones we've got are just the best.
[1:51:46.840 --> 1:51:50.480]  You know, food you can argue, pay way more, get better, obviously.
[1:51:50.480 --> 1:51:53.240]  Some of the storeable food is like gourmet and it's like, what the hell is delicious?
[1:51:53.240 --> 1:51:54.840]  You're like a fat pig.
[1:51:54.840 --> 1:51:56.520]  A lot of them, my favorite stuff is delicious.
[1:51:56.520 --> 1:51:59.880]  Some of them are just okay, but it's the best price and the highest quality for lasting
[1:51:59.880 --> 1:52:00.880]  a long time.
[1:52:00.880 --> 1:52:01.880]  That's all for now.
[1:52:01.880 --> 1:52:02.880]  Go to infowarstore.com.
[1:52:02.880 --> 1:52:03.880]  Take action now and support the M4.
[1:52:03.880 --> 1:52:04.880]  Support yourself.
[1:52:04.880 --> 1:52:05.880]  Be part of the Second American Revolution.
[1:52:05.880 --> 1:52:13.880]  A little more than a decade ago, it happened in Salt Lake City, Utah.
[1:52:13.880 --> 1:52:18.880]  The public came out on a very clear day and looked up more than 60,000 feet and saw what
[1:52:18.880 --> 1:52:20.880]  they thought was a giant UFO.
[1:52:20.880 --> 1:52:25.880]  It was actually a large DARPA government surveillance blimp.
[1:52:25.880 --> 1:52:30.400]  There were thousands of phone calls made in the police department, newspapers, TV stations
[1:52:30.400 --> 1:52:31.400]  thinking it was an alien craft.
[1:52:31.400 --> 1:52:35.400]  When the public was told that it was a blimp, they didn't want to believe it, you see, they
[1:52:35.400 --> 1:52:40.400]  had already told themselves it was a UFO, so they had cognitive distance.
[1:52:40.400 --> 1:52:45.800]  It's kind of like the fact that COVID-19 is hundreds of times weaker than the flu, but
[1:52:45.800 --> 1:52:49.800]  people still want to live in fear and wear a mask outside, even in their cars, even in
[1:52:49.800 --> 1:52:50.800]  their houses.
[1:52:50.800 --> 1:52:53.040]  Well, it happened again over New Jersey yesterday.
[1:52:53.040 --> 1:52:57.600]  The Goodyear blimp was out there with a big gumbo-tron TV screen on the side of it and
[1:52:57.600 --> 1:52:59.880]  had flashing lights on it, just like an airplane.
[1:52:59.880 --> 1:53:04.880]  The public thought it was a UFO, and now the public still believes it was a UFO, and now
[1:53:04.880 --> 1:53:05.880]  they were told it wasn't.
[1:53:05.880 --> 1:53:09.680]  You see, that's called a highly suggestible group of slaves.
[1:53:09.680 --> 1:53:14.720]  It sounds over the top when I go on air, and I explain that the controllers of the planet
[1:53:14.720 --> 1:53:19.520]  want to carry out the extermination of the entire human population, except for a few
[1:53:19.520 --> 1:53:22.960]  of what they call their new transcendent silicon gods.
[1:53:22.960 --> 1:53:25.800]  But that's really what they're now externalizing.
[1:53:25.800 --> 1:53:30.040]  They're now taking what was in their textbooks and white papers 30 years ago and actually
[1:53:30.040 --> 1:53:32.120]  openly announcing it everywhere.
[1:53:32.120 --> 1:53:36.280]  They're going from beta to operation, and think about all these major corporations.
[1:53:36.280 --> 1:53:37.640]  They tell you humans are horrible.
[1:53:37.640 --> 1:53:39.320]  They tell you humans are a parasite.
[1:53:39.320 --> 1:53:42.640]  They tell you that we've all got to be gotten rid of, and then they won't let people see
[1:53:42.640 --> 1:53:46.240]  their old folks in nursing homes and then ship in COVID to kill them.
[1:53:46.240 --> 1:53:52.080]  That's all organizing as a beta test for larger operations, and everything is a microcosm
[1:53:52.080 --> 1:53:57.360]  and a laboratory test of larger scalability of what they are now beginning to roll out.
[1:53:57.360 --> 1:54:01.280]  Look at how they're banning medical doctors from promoting therapeutics.
[1:54:01.280 --> 1:54:04.920]  They're absolutely essential to stop viral infections like COVID-19.
[1:54:04.920 --> 1:54:07.480]  This is all absolute information control.
[1:54:07.480 --> 1:54:33.480]  This is beyond 1904.
[1:54:33.480 --> 1:54:58.860]  This is what they call their old colonists.
[1:54:58.860 --> 1:55:10.860]  Alright, some stations don't care this first five minutes, so I'm going to go to her in
[1:55:10.860 --> 1:55:11.860]  about five minutes.
[1:55:11.860 --> 1:55:12.860]  We're going to break.
[1:55:12.860 --> 1:55:17.540]  Dr. Sherry Tinpin, he's looking at her beautiful face right there, for TV viewers.
[1:55:17.540 --> 1:55:26.100]  I have been interviewing her for 25 years, and I tell you, it's been one hell of a fight.
[1:55:26.100 --> 1:55:29.940]  But I tell you, she was somebody back when it was not popular as a medical doctor to
[1:55:29.940 --> 1:55:32.940]  come out against vaccines, she was there.
[1:55:32.940 --> 1:55:37.060]  And so, I am very pleased to have her, she does do a lot of interviews, she has a very
[1:55:37.060 --> 1:55:43.380]  busy life, but she's coming on to talk about all the things that have happened with COVID-19
[1:55:43.380 --> 1:55:46.860]  and where it's going and just her observations, and I'm going to try to shut up and give her
[1:55:46.860 --> 1:55:51.900]  the floor, but I will intersperse some of these articles.
[1:55:51.900 --> 1:55:56.100]  Little judge rules Pennsylvania Governor Tom Wolfe's Lockdowns Unconstitutional.
[1:55:56.100 --> 1:56:06.020]  WHO Director and Chinese Puppet assists Biden campaign in a tip to keep COVID hysteria alive.
[1:56:06.020 --> 1:56:10.660]  Trump defends indoor rally, but AIDS express concern.
[1:56:10.660 --> 1:56:13.860]  The BLM, the studies say, helped COVID.
[1:56:13.860 --> 1:56:16.780]  Bill Gates slams FDA.
[1:56:16.780 --> 1:56:17.980]  What's going on with that vaccine fight?
[1:56:17.980 --> 1:56:18.980]  I actually know the inside baseball.
[1:56:18.980 --> 1:56:21.860]  I'm going to ask Dr. Sherry Tinpin his deal.
[1:56:21.860 --> 1:56:23.980]  Trump doesn't want Gates's vaccine.
[1:56:23.980 --> 1:56:27.460]  They want to hold it up, have hysteria, until Trump's out, then Gates has his dangerous
[1:56:27.460 --> 1:56:28.460]  vaccine.
[1:56:28.460 --> 1:56:30.660]  Trump says, oh yeah, we'll have one to take the power from Gates.
[1:56:30.660 --> 1:56:34.940]  And I was told that from sources when the president saw it and get mad, I was told the
[1:56:34.940 --> 1:56:35.940]  same thing on the second amendment.
[1:56:35.940 --> 1:56:39.460]  He said, letting, he's going to tell Pelosi, you can have whatever you want, she goes fine,
[1:56:39.460 --> 1:56:41.460]  ban all the guns, and it killed it all.
[1:56:41.460 --> 1:56:43.060]  I don't do Machiavellian stuff.
[1:56:43.060 --> 1:56:47.100]  Trump is doing that, and it's black magic, and I don't think it's good.
[1:56:47.100 --> 1:56:51.540]  I mean, I'm just being honest with you, and by black magic, I mean, it's like the ring
[1:56:51.540 --> 1:56:52.580]  of Mordor.
[1:56:52.580 --> 1:56:55.940]  You can win the war with the ring, but you become evil the longer you wear it.
[1:56:55.940 --> 1:57:01.700]  I mean, I don't do stuff like that, and I mean, I know how, and I'm actually criticizing
[1:57:01.700 --> 1:57:03.500]  Trump here, but that's what he's doing.
[1:57:03.500 --> 1:57:07.340]  We predicted that from what I was told, the White House, this is what happened, he's done
[1:57:07.340 --> 1:57:08.340]  it.
[1:57:08.340 --> 1:57:09.340]  He's gotten the left to come out and get vaccines.
[1:57:09.340 --> 1:57:11.860]  We'll talk about it in a minute.
[1:57:11.860 --> 1:57:14.020]  I guess I do want to wear the ring of Mordor.
[1:57:14.020 --> 1:57:18.020]  I guess when you're this desperate, you do start wearing it, but then you turn into Gollum,
[1:57:18.020 --> 1:57:24.260]  legal, Trump administration pushes to expand, extend coronavirus immigration limits so
[1:57:24.260 --> 1:57:28.420]  the U.N. is flooding us with the illegals to bankrupt the country, so at least Trump's
[1:57:28.420 --> 1:57:30.380]  making lemonade with the lemons.
[1:57:30.380 --> 1:57:35.100]  Australia's full-scale pilot test for the New World Order, just incredible police state
[1:57:35.100 --> 1:57:38.700]  they admit under U.N. control.
[1:57:38.700 --> 1:57:39.700]  That's all coming up.
[1:57:39.700 --> 1:57:45.020]  Biden campaign, remember, said that Trump's travel ban was xenophobic, but now they say
[1:57:45.020 --> 1:57:49.500]  they support it.
[1:57:49.500 --> 1:57:52.980]  China's struggling to convince its citizens to take the Chinese main shots because they
[1:57:52.980 --> 1:57:56.180]  say they don't work and make you sick.
[1:57:56.180 --> 1:57:59.420]  Snitch on your neighbors to police if they break the rule of six.
[1:57:59.420 --> 1:58:02.740]  So first it was six feet, now it's only six.
[1:58:02.740 --> 1:58:05.020]  Next I guess they'll say six inoculations.
[1:58:05.020 --> 1:58:09.340]  That's what Gates is now saying, six, six, six, so it just gets weirder and weirder.
[1:58:09.340 --> 1:58:13.420]  NBC News highlights UV light sanitizing against coronavirus.
[1:58:13.420 --> 1:58:17.100]  Trump said that six months ago and they said he was the biggest devil on earth.
[1:58:17.100 --> 1:58:19.460]  Now it's NBC News.
[1:58:19.460 --> 1:58:24.620]  Meanwhile, Trump offered to help Gigi Ping with COVID, but he didn't want Trump to send
[1:58:24.620 --> 1:58:27.980]  U.S. support because they wanted to cover up what was really happening.
[1:58:27.980 --> 1:58:32.660]  Meanwhile, in Wuhan, they're having giant pool parties with 50,000 people, but they
[1:58:32.660 --> 1:58:34.700]  say it's okay for them to gather.
[1:58:34.700 --> 1:58:35.700]  China's open for business.
[1:58:35.700 --> 1:58:36.780]  You just can't gather.
[1:58:36.780 --> 1:58:43.100]  See how that economic weapon works?
[1:58:43.100 --> 1:58:49.660]  So Dr. Sherry Tenpenny will lay it all out with us on the other side of the 62nd break,
[1:58:49.660 --> 1:58:53.500]  but I'm going to ask our beautiful, our amazing listeners and viewers.
[1:58:53.500 --> 1:58:56.340]  You know what happens with a million of you tuned in right now conservatively?
[1:58:56.340 --> 1:58:59.580]  If you just go on Facebook, go on Twitter, go on your email, go on your text messages
[1:58:59.580 --> 1:59:05.740]  and send the live link to the show on infowars.com to livefeedinfowars.com for a live show or
[1:59:05.740 --> 1:59:10.700]  newswars.com for a live show or the live feed, send it to people and ask them to share it.
[1:59:10.700 --> 1:59:13.860]  It causes that chain reaction.
[1:59:13.860 --> 1:59:14.860]  The truth's on right now.
[1:59:14.860 --> 1:59:15.860]  Share it.
[1:59:15.860 --> 1:59:18.380]  We'll be right back.
[1:59:18.380 --> 1:59:21.380]  Remember 15 days to flatten the curve because the hospitals were so full?
[1:59:21.380 --> 1:59:22.380]  Of course, all that was a lie.
[1:59:22.380 --> 1:59:23.380]  All that was a fraud.
[1:59:23.380 --> 1:59:26.980]  The Rockefeller and Bill Gates documents from the beginning on record, they said the mask
[1:59:26.980 --> 1:59:28.980]  wearing will never end.
[1:59:28.980 --> 1:59:30.540]  The social distancing will never end.
[1:59:30.540 --> 1:59:32.420]  The forced inoculations will never end.
[1:59:32.420 --> 1:59:36.660]  The social tracking through your cell phones and the global social credit score will never
[1:59:36.660 --> 1:59:37.660]  end.
[1:59:37.660 --> 1:59:40.940]  And we put up with it, this is the rollout of the post-human world.
[1:59:40.940 --> 1:59:46.540]  I know you know that, but I've seen national Democrat Party statements that I've seen CNN
[1:59:46.540 --> 1:59:49.940]  and others point out that Jones says that COVID is a hoax.
[1:59:49.940 --> 1:59:51.900]  What I'm saying is it's an overblown fraud.
[1:59:51.900 --> 1:59:52.900]  It's a scam.
[1:59:52.900 --> 1:59:54.900]  But he sells infowars.com masks.
[1:59:54.900 --> 2:00:00.060]  Yes, if you're going to be made to do it to fly on an airport or by the police on a train,
[2:00:00.060 --> 2:00:04.100]  then fight back with information warfare, have a walking billboard.
[2:00:04.100 --> 2:00:08.300]  That's hypocrisy to be able to hold two different ideas in your head at the same time.
[2:00:08.300 --> 2:00:12.100]  If you're going to be raped by these people, they're going to put the burqa over your head.
[2:00:12.100 --> 2:00:15.220]  Might as well advertise it with infowars.com.
[2:00:15.220 --> 2:00:45.020]  Yes, that's simple, ladies and gentlemen, fight back.
[2:00:45.020 --> 2:00:46.020]  Let's go.
[2:00:46.020 --> 2:00:58.700]  You know, I've gotten to hang out with Willie Nelson in Lucanbuck, but nobody was there.
[2:00:58.700 --> 2:01:06.020]  He's got a place out there right outside of Fredericksburg.
[2:01:06.020 --> 2:01:12.060]  And I'm not dropping names here, I'm just saying fighting tyranny has taken me on an
[2:01:12.060 --> 2:01:15.340]  incredible journey.
[2:01:15.340 --> 2:01:18.940]  Ain't nobody feeling no pain.
[2:01:18.940 --> 2:01:39.860]  Listen to a little bit more of this song a little bit more, I guess.
[2:01:39.860 --> 2:01:47.220]  Dr. Sherrie Tenpenny, faxter.com, V-A-X-X-T-E-R.com.
[2:01:47.220 --> 2:01:56.020]  Dr. Sherrie Tenpenny is an osteopathic medical doctor, board certified in three specialties.
[2:01:56.020 --> 2:02:02.940]  She is the founder of Tenpenny Medical Center and a integrative medical clinic located near
[2:02:02.940 --> 2:02:04.460]  Cleveland, Ohio.
[2:02:04.460 --> 2:02:07.460]  She's been, everyone in that clinic since 1996.
[2:02:07.460 --> 2:02:12.940]  Her company provides a natural holistic approach to getting well and not prescription medications.
[2:02:12.940 --> 2:02:17.460]  The medical clinic's primary focus is thyroid conditions, breast health, and resolving problems
[2:02:17.460 --> 2:02:19.580]  associated with allergies and pain.
[2:02:19.580 --> 2:02:26.020]  Her approaches have been attracted patients from all over the 50 states and 17 countries.
[2:02:26.020 --> 2:02:32.900]  Dr. Sherrie Tenpenny has invested more than 17 years, this is an old bio, in over 20,000
[2:02:32.900 --> 2:02:37.740]  hours documenting the problems associated with vaccines and an internationally known
[2:02:37.740 --> 2:02:38.740]  speaker and author.
[2:02:38.740 --> 2:02:42.020]  Her many articles have been translated into more than 12 languages.
[2:02:42.020 --> 2:02:47.020]  Her book, Say No to Vaccines, a resource guide to all ages, and she joins us.
[2:02:47.020 --> 2:02:48.020]  Wow.
[2:02:48.020 --> 2:02:49.020]  Where do you want to start?
[2:02:49.020 --> 2:02:50.260]  Great to have you with us.
[2:02:50.260 --> 2:02:57.460]  So crazy to have Bill Gates on the left now, not wanting Trump's vaccine, having these
[2:02:57.460 --> 2:03:02.820]  vaccines that change the DNA of the cell, a new type of vaccine, the trials causing
[2:03:02.820 --> 2:03:05.860]  80% sick, 20% hospitalizations.
[2:03:05.860 --> 2:03:08.060]  There's so many angles to lockdown.
[2:03:08.060 --> 2:03:09.060]  You've got the floor.
[2:03:09.060 --> 2:03:10.580]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[2:03:10.580 --> 2:03:13.260]  Oh, thank you so much for having me, Alex.
[2:03:13.260 --> 2:03:16.540]  Yes, we've been, we've had an agenda for a really long time.
[2:03:16.540 --> 2:03:21.420]  I've been doing this for 20 years, and so I think that early on, I was on your show
[2:03:21.420 --> 2:03:25.940]  very, very early on, and I think it's pretty interesting how all of the things that you've
[2:03:25.940 --> 2:03:29.180]  been saying, all these 20 years that you and I've been together and all the work that
[2:03:29.180 --> 2:03:32.260]  you've done between infowars and prison planet.
[2:03:32.260 --> 2:03:36.580]  Here we are now on an inflammation war and stuck in a prisoner planet.
[2:03:36.580 --> 2:03:39.860]  So you've been prophetic for a lot of years.
[2:03:39.860 --> 2:03:41.780]  So thank you for having me on your show again.
[2:03:41.780 --> 2:03:45.060]  Well, I was just reading what the Rockefeller Foundation said they were planning, and I
[2:03:45.060 --> 2:03:47.300]  knew they were in charge, so I figured we might want to oppose it.
[2:03:47.300 --> 2:03:49.660]  It had a good chance of happening, and now we're here.
[2:03:49.660 --> 2:03:51.540]  So I threw out the laundry list there.
[2:03:51.540 --> 2:03:52.540]  Where do you want to start?
[2:03:52.540 --> 2:03:56.340]  Just take over, doctor, because I know you run big clinics and speak to huge groups all
[2:03:56.340 --> 2:03:57.340]  over the world.
[2:03:57.340 --> 2:03:59.260]  Give us your report, Herr Doctor.
[2:03:59.260 --> 2:04:04.820]  Well, I started this back in February when I said, took a look around the horizon and
[2:04:04.820 --> 2:04:07.700]  said, why is everybody making such a big deal about this?
[2:04:07.700 --> 2:04:10.940]  We're going to find out in about four to six months that this was a big, fat, nothing
[2:04:10.940 --> 2:04:17.060]  burger virus, and it's going to be no worse than a bad flu season, and what we've actually
[2:04:17.060 --> 2:04:21.020]  found out is it's not even as bad as a bad flu season.
[2:04:21.020 --> 2:04:28.140]  With a survival rate of 99.96%, yet we've shut down the entire world.
[2:04:28.140 --> 2:04:32.420]  And when I kind of took a step back at the beginning and said, what are we, what's happening
[2:04:32.420 --> 2:04:33.420]  here?
[2:04:33.420 --> 2:04:34.420]  And then I said, oh, I get it.
[2:04:34.420 --> 2:04:36.500]  This is the same playbook, different virus, right?
[2:04:36.500 --> 2:04:44.580]  We did SARS and we did, in 2002, we did MERS, we did bird flu in 2005, we did H1N1 in 2009.
[2:04:44.580 --> 2:04:50.300]  So now here we are again, except they've had 50 years, 50, 50 years to perfect their
[2:04:50.300 --> 2:04:54.500]  ability to shut down the entire world all at the same time.
[2:04:54.500 --> 2:04:59.620]  And they laid a lot of groundwork in the backdrop to be able to make this happen.
[2:04:59.620 --> 2:05:03.860]  Like the one thing that has stood out, and I've talked a lot about this over the last
[2:05:03.860 --> 2:05:08.980]  several months, is the 2005 PREP Act, the Public Readiness and Emergency Preparedness
[2:05:08.980 --> 2:05:16.380]  Act passed in 2005 in the dead of night on a Saturday night by a Republican and a Republican
[2:05:16.380 --> 2:05:22.500]  president who signed it into law, and the PREP Act gives them 100% a complete immunity
[2:05:22.500 --> 2:05:30.420]  for any covered countermeasure, which means that anything that is now made for COVID-19,
[2:05:30.420 --> 2:05:37.820]  whether it's a drug, a biologic, a vaccine, a technology, a software, anything between
[2:05:37.820 --> 2:05:45.460]  March 17th of 2020, and this goes through 2024, anything that's made during that period
[2:05:45.460 --> 2:05:52.340]  of time that is under the umbrella of COVID, is now given 100% liability protection and
[2:05:52.340 --> 2:05:53.340]  immunity.
[2:05:53.340 --> 2:05:59.220]  And the only way you can have any recourse if anything goes awry, which it will, is to
[2:05:59.220 --> 2:06:05.140]  be able to convince the U.S. Attorney General that the people had manufactured this particular
[2:06:05.140 --> 2:06:10.660]  product under an act of willful misconduct, which absolutely cannot happen according
[2:06:10.660 --> 2:06:11.660]  to law.
[2:06:11.660 --> 2:06:16.860]  It's so nearly impossible to prove for all intents and purposes it doesn't exist.
[2:06:16.860 --> 2:06:20.700]  So we've got, you know, same playbook, different virus.
[2:06:20.700 --> 2:06:26.060]  We have the PREP Act in place, and then they started doing all this nonsense with testing.
[2:06:26.060 --> 2:06:30.340]  And Alex, when I wrote an article on Baxter about testing, like this testing, what are
[2:06:30.340 --> 2:06:32.340]  we doing, and what does it mean?
[2:06:32.340 --> 2:06:38.380]  I spent about 20 hours just reading the CDC and the FDA website, trying to figure out
[2:06:38.380 --> 2:06:42.780]  if they had a definition for what it meant to be positive.
[2:06:42.780 --> 2:06:45.100]  Because if it's positive, does that mean you're infectious?
[2:06:45.100 --> 2:06:49.340]  Well, if you're asymptomatic and you don't have a fever or cough or any of those things,
[2:06:49.340 --> 2:06:52.740]  well, positive means you've been exposed to this virus somewhere along the line, and
[2:06:52.740 --> 2:06:56.220]  now you are in a healthy person.
[2:06:56.220 --> 2:06:57.500]  Does that mean you're immune?
[2:06:57.500 --> 2:06:58.620]  Does that mean you're safe?
[2:06:58.620 --> 2:07:03.780]  Or does that mean if you're positive and you're at case, now you need to self-quarantine?
[2:07:03.780 --> 2:07:05.060]  What does it mean if you're negative?
[2:07:05.060 --> 2:07:06.460]  Does that mean you're susceptible?
[2:07:06.460 --> 2:07:10.940]  You need to stay in the house or does it mean that you're healthy because you have a negative
[2:07:10.940 --> 2:07:11.940]  test?
[2:07:11.940 --> 2:07:15.900]  And they've intentionally left it with a lot of ambiguity, haven't they?
[2:07:15.900 --> 2:07:17.900]  Oh, absolutely.
[2:07:17.900 --> 2:07:22.980]  And so that's why we went from now everything is all this public policy, all these changes,
[2:07:22.980 --> 2:07:27.820]  all these things that are happening inside of industry, and shutting down travel industry,
[2:07:27.820 --> 2:07:33.140]  shutting down hotels and restaurants and hairdressers and all of these things based on cases, and
[2:07:33.140 --> 2:07:35.100]  the cases mean absolutely nothing.
[2:07:35.100 --> 2:07:39.500]  It means you've been exposed to that virus somewhere along the line, and if you're asymptomatic,
[2:07:39.500 --> 2:07:41.500]  it has no validity whatsoever.
[2:07:41.500 --> 2:07:47.060]  And when you've got a test that has up to a 30% false negative rate, and in the 40 or
[2:07:47.060 --> 2:07:52.620]  some labs that we've saw where they had, where every one of their samples tested positive,
[2:07:52.620 --> 2:07:57.700]  so they have a 100% positivity rate, which is statistically impossible.
[2:07:57.700 --> 2:08:03.980]  So now on the one hand, you have a 30% false negative and up to a 100% false positive rate,
[2:08:03.980 --> 2:08:09.380]  you've got a PCR test that was never intended to be used in terms of diagnostic control.
[2:08:09.380 --> 2:08:13.340]  It was really designed for DNA viruses, not RNA viruses.
[2:08:13.340 --> 2:08:19.100]  The entire testing stuff is nothing more than harvesting your DNA to be able to collect
[2:08:19.100 --> 2:08:22.020]  it into a database, which now they passed the law in the U.K.
[2:08:22.020 --> 2:08:25.700]  So that's what this really is, is a giant DNA database harvesting operation.
[2:08:25.700 --> 2:08:30.940]  And they just, in September 10th, they just passed the law in the U.K. that says that
[2:08:30.940 --> 2:08:36.780]  any sample that's now collected in the U.K., beginning October 1st for the next six months,
[2:08:36.780 --> 2:08:40.420]  will be held and put into a database for national security.
[2:08:40.420 --> 2:08:44.460]  So your first approximation six months ago has been proven dead on as a medical doctor
[2:08:44.460 --> 2:08:46.180]  in your wide knowledge of this.
[2:08:46.180 --> 2:08:50.220]  When we come back and we tell you what you think's coming next, but clearly a giant liability
[2:08:50.220 --> 2:08:56.540]  protection act, a license to steal, a get out of jail card, just like the 1985-86 act.
[2:08:56.540 --> 2:09:02.500]  I mean, this is an emergence of a big pharma, instead of the U.N. coming out admitting that
[2:09:02.500 --> 2:09:06.260]  vaccines are causing problems, which they did, instead of giving up, they're doubling
[2:09:06.260 --> 2:09:08.060]  down with a giant power graph.
[2:09:08.060 --> 2:09:12.900]  And then I want to ask you, what do you make of Trump saying, okay, fine, and the Russians
[2:09:12.900 --> 2:09:13.900]  too, oh, we have ours.
[2:09:13.900 --> 2:09:17.580]  We don't want Bill Gates's, probably sugar water, that's what I think's going on.
[2:09:17.580 --> 2:09:21.300]  I was told Trump's taking control of Fauci, I still think it's a dangerous game.
[2:09:21.300 --> 2:09:25.140]  We'll ask your point of view on that, but just briefly in the minute we have, what else
[2:09:25.140 --> 2:09:27.180]  do you want to get into?
[2:09:27.180 --> 2:09:28.700]  I want to talk about masks.
[2:09:28.700 --> 2:09:30.780]  I want to talk about social distancing.
[2:09:30.780 --> 2:09:34.940]  I want to talk about hydroxychloroquine, and I want to talk about the vaccine.
[2:09:34.940 --> 2:09:43.340]  Wow, Dr. Sherrie Tenpenny, V-A-X-X-T-E-R, vaxter.com, you want to visit it, you want to read it,
[2:09:43.340 --> 2:09:45.180]  you want to share it.
[2:09:45.180 --> 2:09:47.340]  And then I'm going to ask her this, I'm writing this down.
[2:09:47.340 --> 2:09:51.060]  What do you make of Fauci, first thing, oh, no, vitamins, minerals don't help you.
[2:09:51.060 --> 2:09:54.860]  You don't need D3, you don't need zinc, blew up in his face so bad, now he's like, no,
[2:09:54.860 --> 2:09:55.860]  you do need it.
[2:09:55.860 --> 2:10:00.820]  Now, yeah, we don't need him to tell us that, but, let's say, plants need sun-lizing, no,
[2:10:00.820 --> 2:10:01.820]  you don't need sunlight.
[2:10:01.820 --> 2:10:04.660]  We're like, okay, you're an idiot, plants do need sunlight.
[2:10:04.660 --> 2:10:08.660]  I mean, it's, I'm trying to imitate his voice, but it's just ridiculous.
[2:10:08.660 --> 2:10:10.140]  That blew up in his face so he had to admit it.
[2:10:10.140 --> 2:10:15.980]  We'll be right back in a few minutes, Dr. Sherrie Tenpenny, stay with us.
[2:10:15.980 --> 2:10:20.300]  The trick that social engineers use is very, very simple.
[2:10:20.300 --> 2:10:26.860]  They just teach us that the architecture of civilization, that the trajectory of a species
[2:10:26.860 --> 2:10:33.020]  is designed by these ever-knowing, loving, liberal technocrats, and that if we just sit
[2:10:33.020 --> 2:10:36.820]  back and enjoy the ride, everything will be great, but then they tell us that humans
[2:10:36.820 --> 2:10:40.420]  are obsolete, not essential, and we're bad through the earth, and we need to be phased
[2:10:40.420 --> 2:10:41.420]  out.
[2:10:41.420 --> 2:10:46.500]  So, they're very open about what they're doing, and they count on us just being very
[2:10:46.500 --> 2:10:51.780]  passive living in the matrix-like system that they're building.
[2:10:51.780 --> 2:10:56.900]  But what defines humans more than anything from the rest of the, quote, animal kingdom
[2:10:56.900 --> 2:11:02.380]  is that we control our environment, we build our own environments, we create our own systems,
[2:11:02.380 --> 2:11:08.940]  we really geo-engineer and terraform the planet, and its systems towards our aims.
[2:11:08.940 --> 2:11:12.740]  But instead, we're acting like animals, and the globalists play the part of humans, and
[2:11:12.740 --> 2:11:15.940]  us as cattle, and that's the trick.
[2:11:15.940 --> 2:11:19.300]  It couldn't have been scripted any better.
[2:11:19.300 --> 2:11:25.260]  That's because it was completely scripted, and we even know the names of the United Nations
[2:11:25.260 --> 2:11:30.140]  Rockefeller Foundation, Bill Mullen Decades, and John Hopkins Toppings.
[2:11:30.140 --> 2:11:34.580]  They have the script, just like you'd have for a Hollywood movie, and it's designed
[2:11:34.580 --> 2:11:43.660]  to free civilization and have a post-remissance, stagnation, or new dark age, and a total consolidation
[2:11:43.660 --> 2:11:49.020]  of all wealth and power in the hands of the kleptocratic post-humanist.
[2:11:49.020 --> 2:11:53.820]  The magnitude of this is unfathomable, but you can see all the checkboxes of tyranny
[2:11:53.820 --> 2:11:59.140]  are being marked carefully, every eye dotted, every T crossed, a total societal vertical
[2:11:59.140 --> 2:12:03.700]  integration takeover, medical tyranny, total surveillance, the big tech heads on average
[2:12:03.700 --> 2:12:07.620]  have had their wealth coped up 35% in the last eight months, and of course Jeff Bezos
[2:12:07.620 --> 2:12:09.900]  has basically doubled it.
[2:12:09.900 --> 2:12:13.340]  Everyone is being forced onto their system to post-human robot takeover, you're being
[2:12:13.340 --> 2:12:18.620]  made obsolete.
[2:12:18.620 --> 2:12:42.940]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:12:42.940 --> 2:12:47.340]  It's not something that you'd get recommend, but there are two vitamins that you should
[2:12:47.340 --> 2:12:48.340]  consider.
[2:12:48.340 --> 2:12:54.740]  For example, if you are deficient in vitamin D, that does have an impact on your susceptibility
[2:12:54.740 --> 2:12:56.060]  to infection.
[2:12:56.060 --> 2:13:03.140]  So I would not mind recommending, and I do it myself, taking vitamin D supplement.
[2:13:03.140 --> 2:13:08.420]  The other vitamin that people take is vitamin C because it's a good antioxidant.
[2:13:08.420 --> 2:13:14.740]  So if people want to take a gram or two at the most of vitamin C, that would be fine.
[2:13:14.740 --> 2:13:21.980]  So vitamin C and vitamin D, okay.
[2:13:21.980 --> 2:13:28.940]  So Fauci says, I mean, people got swapped by the FBI for giving vitamin C their patients
[2:13:28.940 --> 2:13:29.940]  as a preventative.
[2:13:29.940 --> 2:13:33.940]  Metal doctors did, and Fauci said it wouldn't help you, the UN said, what do you make of
[2:13:33.940 --> 2:13:38.420]  that Dr. Sherry Tinpinny, medical doctor, Trollblazer exposing the dangers of vaccines
[2:13:38.420 --> 2:13:43.740]  and wanting safer ones, or no vaccines now, I guess, in your deep research, give us your
[2:13:43.740 --> 2:13:44.740]  own view on that.
[2:13:44.740 --> 2:13:45.740]  I'm going from memory.
[2:13:45.740 --> 2:13:50.980]  But what do you make of the Hoover Institute and Stanford University having their videos
[2:13:50.980 --> 2:13:55.220]  banned by YouTube, because professors came out and said the UN lied to us about COVID,
[2:13:55.220 --> 2:14:00.780]  exaggerated it, and that they blocked therapeutics and that they shouldn't be in control of speech.
[2:14:00.780 --> 2:14:02.620]  And then Big Tech blocked Stanford.
[2:14:02.620 --> 2:14:05.980]  I mean, when is Congress going to act on this censorship?
[2:14:05.980 --> 2:14:10.100]  That's a whole other subject of all these medical doctors and scientists being censored
[2:14:10.100 --> 2:14:14.980]  by Big Tech as a consortium, as a racketeering cartel.
[2:14:14.980 --> 2:14:17.940]  Yes, all of it.
[2:14:17.940 --> 2:14:19.980]  I mean, when are they going to act?
[2:14:19.980 --> 2:14:23.580]  And when are they going to shut down this whole idea of censorship?
[2:14:23.580 --> 2:14:26.740]  And when are the physicians going to get brave enough to step forward?
[2:14:26.740 --> 2:14:31.020]  You know, there was a lawsuit that was just filed this week in Kansas by a group of physicians
[2:14:31.020 --> 2:14:34.940]  who said, we must end this mask mandate for healthy people.
[2:14:34.940 --> 2:14:37.220]  So finally, physicians are starting to step forward.
[2:14:37.220 --> 2:14:41.180]  You know, when Dr. Simone Gold, you know, stepped forward and said, hey, hydroxychloroquine
[2:14:41.180 --> 2:14:44.380]  saves people's lives and got fired from her job the next day.
[2:14:44.380 --> 2:14:48.940]  I mean, this whole thing is, and it's just every day it changes, Alex.
[2:14:48.940 --> 2:14:52.540]  You know, people ask me, how are you doing today, Dr. Tenpenny, with all this craziness
[2:14:52.540 --> 2:14:53.540]  going on?
[2:14:53.540 --> 2:14:57.180]  I said, well, you know, today this part of the matrix seems to be pretty good, because
[2:14:57.180 --> 2:14:59.100]  every day it's a big flip-flop.
[2:14:59.100 --> 2:15:00.700]  Don't wear the mask, wear the mask.
[2:15:00.700 --> 2:15:02.540]  Social distance, don't social distance.
[2:15:02.540 --> 2:15:06.620]  Hydroxychloroquine is horrible, and then in the state of Ohio, within 24 hours they turned
[2:15:06.620 --> 2:15:09.100]  it around and said, no, you can prescribe it for anything you want.
[2:15:09.100 --> 2:15:11.140]  You don't have to put down a diagnosis.
[2:15:11.140 --> 2:15:12.140]  So it's every day.
[2:15:12.140 --> 2:15:13.140]  You don't need D3.
[2:15:13.140 --> 2:15:15.620]  Now you've got to have it to live.
[2:15:15.620 --> 2:15:16.620]  Exactly.
[2:15:16.620 --> 2:15:21.220]  And this should be such a clue to everybody to say, if this doesn't just tell you it's
[2:15:21.220 --> 2:15:27.060]  all about a power grab and control, it has nothing to do with health, nothing to do with
[2:15:27.060 --> 2:15:33.060]  sickness, nothing to do with protection from a measly little infection that really, for
[2:15:33.060 --> 2:15:38.420]  the vast majority of people, means nothing, that people don't understand that masks are
[2:15:38.420 --> 2:15:44.860]  just the first step towards tyrannical control of society and dehumanization and social
[2:15:44.860 --> 2:15:45.860]  engineering.
[2:15:45.860 --> 2:15:51.900]  If we can't get people, Alex, to stop wearing a mask, how are we ever going to get them
[2:15:51.900 --> 2:15:53.180]  to say no to this vaccine?
[2:15:53.180 --> 2:15:54.460]  Well, that's what it's all about.
[2:15:54.460 --> 2:15:58.980]  They admit it's an archetypal symbol, a lecture, real law for men and women, a muzzle, a literal
[2:15:58.980 --> 2:16:03.820]  gag that we're prisoners who have been silenced by them.
[2:16:03.820 --> 2:16:04.820]  Exactly.
[2:16:04.820 --> 2:16:05.820]  And that's exactly what it is.
[2:16:05.820 --> 2:16:09.660]  And now that we know that masks, I mean, I put together on Vaxster, I wrote an article
[2:16:09.660 --> 2:16:11.380]  about masks don't work.
[2:16:11.380 --> 2:16:16.780]  And inside of there, there's a document that I put together that has almost 50 links to
[2:16:16.780 --> 2:16:23.340]  text from a PubMed that shows that masks do nothing but harm the person who wears them.
[2:16:23.340 --> 2:16:26.860]  Tell us about the title of that article at your great website so everybody can share
[2:16:26.860 --> 2:16:27.860]  it.
[2:16:27.860 --> 2:16:32.260]  That's, masks don't work.
[2:16:32.260 --> 2:16:33.260]  It's pretty directly.
[2:16:33.260 --> 2:16:34.260]  And that's V-A-X-X-T-E-R.
[2:16:34.260 --> 2:16:40.060]  And again, listeners, I know you know all this, we're here to get you active to warn
[2:16:40.060 --> 2:16:44.340]  people because if folks will just take their D3, if they'll just take their C, if they'll
[2:16:44.340 --> 2:16:49.900]  just take their zinc, not just this, but the flu, pneumonia, all the, am I wrong, Dr.
[2:16:49.900 --> 2:16:50.900]  Tempini?
[2:16:50.900 --> 2:16:55.060]  Even the NIH website says that almost all this disease is a deficiency of those.
[2:16:55.060 --> 2:17:01.220]  Well, it's either a, you know, any disease in any category, whether it's an infection
[2:17:01.220 --> 2:17:07.740]  or heart disease, diabetes, obesity, it's either a deficiency of something or an excess
[2:17:07.740 --> 2:17:08.860]  of something.
[2:17:08.860 --> 2:17:11.260]  And it's, the doctors are supposed to figure out what that is.
[2:17:11.260 --> 2:17:15.740]  The doctors were never intended to be just glorified drug reps, writing words on a piece
[2:17:15.740 --> 2:17:19.780]  of paper and handing them out for a living, which is, you know, just absolutely just,
[2:17:19.780 --> 2:17:22.740]  you know, being a minion of the drug reps.
[2:17:22.740 --> 2:17:28.980]  So this is, you know, I actually, the article that I wrote on mass.work, quote some, Dr.
[2:17:28.980 --> 2:17:35.940]  Rancourt's studies, but I, I've got more than 50 studies on a PDF file that people can
[2:17:35.940 --> 2:17:41.140]  download, print, and hand out, showing everybody that mass don't work.
[2:17:41.140 --> 2:17:47.060]  We partnered with hugs over mass Canada, hugs over mass.ca, Baxter partnered with them.
[2:17:47.060 --> 2:17:52.180]  We've been hosting a series of training webinars on Friday nights to get them all fired up.
[2:17:52.180 --> 2:17:56.380]  We've got hundreds and hundreds of people opening chapters across the U S and Canada
[2:17:56.380 --> 2:17:59.540]  on hugs over masks, hugs over mass.ca.
[2:17:59.540 --> 2:18:02.980]  And by the way, let me just, let's just hear the sound of a car wreck or a record skipping.
[2:18:02.980 --> 2:18:05.460]  I should have opened this up because I knew that about you.
[2:18:05.460 --> 2:18:08.020]  Last time you were on, I've known you 20 plus years.
[2:18:08.020 --> 2:18:09.020]  You are leading.
[2:18:09.020 --> 2:18:12.460]  I mean, I see the speeches you give in Vegas and Europe, where there's like a thousand
[2:18:12.460 --> 2:18:13.940]  doctors, $500.
[2:18:13.940 --> 2:18:18.300]  You are leading the fight with Dr. Russell Blalock and others who I know have given big
[2:18:18.300 --> 2:18:23.940]  speeches to get the healthcare experts mobilized to not be part of this big tyranny.
[2:18:23.940 --> 2:18:28.540]  And so that's really what's beautiful is that's leading the charge against Gates and
[2:18:28.540 --> 2:18:29.620]  Big Pharma.
[2:18:29.620 --> 2:18:33.060]  And they just don't know what to do when the public sees all these medical doctors censored.
[2:18:33.060 --> 2:18:34.300]  It really wakes them up, doesn't it?
[2:18:34.300 --> 2:18:37.180]  So talk about how critical that is, what you've been doing.
[2:18:37.180 --> 2:18:39.420]  Well, we really do.
[2:18:39.420 --> 2:18:43.540]  Our whole role is at Baxter is really to educate the public.
[2:18:43.540 --> 2:18:47.140]  That's why this week is open enrollment for our boot camp course.
[2:18:47.140 --> 2:18:49.020]  We only offer it twice a year.
[2:18:49.020 --> 2:18:56.060]  So when you go to Baxter.com, you saw it on your screenshot there, that our open enrollment
[2:18:56.060 --> 2:19:00.620]  for our boot camp is this week, it will, we only offer it twice a year and we may not
[2:19:00.620 --> 2:19:01.620]  offer it again.
[2:19:01.620 --> 2:19:07.260]  The boot camp is an eight week online educational program that will teach you what you need,
[2:19:07.260 --> 2:19:12.340]  not only what you need to know about vaccines and what you need to know about all this COVID-19
[2:19:12.340 --> 2:19:13.340]  nonsense.
[2:19:13.340 --> 2:19:17.500]  It will actually give you language training on how to communicate it, how to get it out
[2:19:17.500 --> 2:19:21.220]  to the public, how to get out of dicey situations.
[2:19:21.220 --> 2:19:28.060]  And for the first time ever, we're actually doing a whole activist training.
[2:19:28.060 --> 2:19:31.780]  So people can go there, they can read everything about the boot camp.
[2:19:31.780 --> 2:19:35.980]  The next article down on Baxter is about the eight bonuses that you get when you enroll
[2:19:35.980 --> 2:19:37.620]  in the boot camp course.
[2:19:37.620 --> 2:19:40.540]  Boot camp starts September 26.
[2:19:40.540 --> 2:19:44.980]  Every Thursday night, we have an online Zoom class that we talk to the everybody who's
[2:19:44.980 --> 2:19:47.980]  enrolled and we have a class discussion.
[2:19:47.980 --> 2:19:50.540]  And so there's all kinds of new content and everything.
[2:19:50.540 --> 2:19:53.220]  By the way, I mean, I'm getting goosebumps here because you've been one of the leading
[2:19:53.220 --> 2:19:54.340]  people exposing this.
[2:19:54.340 --> 2:19:57.820]  Now the UN admits the front lines wobbly vaccines are hurting people.
[2:19:57.820 --> 2:19:58.820]  There's a cover up.
[2:19:58.820 --> 2:19:59.820]  Nothing's tested.
[2:19:59.820 --> 2:20:01.500]  But I mean, I'm talking to the epicenter.
[2:20:01.500 --> 2:20:05.500]  You've been one of the, you're one of the main epicenters of this global awakening.
[2:20:05.500 --> 2:20:09.700]  Long before Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and I'm not taking credit away from him, I'm just saying
[2:20:09.700 --> 2:20:11.940]  people need to know the power of the individual.
[2:20:11.940 --> 2:20:15.860]  Did you ever think 20 plus years ago when you started seeing your patients hurt by vaccines
[2:20:15.860 --> 2:20:18.780]  that you would be a major leader in this?
[2:20:18.780 --> 2:20:19.780]  I didn't.
[2:20:19.780 --> 2:20:20.780]  I did not, Alex.
[2:20:20.780 --> 2:20:26.940]  In 20 years and 40,000 hours of my time, I really think I'm, I really am one of the leaders.
[2:20:26.940 --> 2:20:30.060]  And my whole point is trying to get people to wake up.
[2:20:30.060 --> 2:20:33.460]  No, we try to get people to ask simple questions.
[2:20:33.460 --> 2:20:37.660]  And I think that the good, some of the good news that came out of this whole COVID shutdown
[2:20:37.660 --> 2:20:43.020]  is that people are now critically examining the problems with vaccines, people that never
[2:20:43.020 --> 2:20:45.460]  even thought about questioning before.
[2:20:45.460 --> 2:20:49.020]  We now have over 60% of people saying, oh, I don't know.
[2:20:49.020 --> 2:20:52.180]  I'm either not going to take it or I'm going to maybe really soon.
[2:20:52.180 --> 2:20:57.780]  The majority of Chinese citizens are telling the government they won't do it.
[2:20:57.780 --> 2:20:58.780]  That's incredible.
[2:20:58.780 --> 2:21:02.580]  In a dictatorship, let's come back and talk about that because what are they going to
[2:21:02.580 --> 2:21:07.620]  do now that we see it's the COVID hoax is the whole vaccine hoax is collapsing.
[2:21:07.620 --> 2:21:12.180]  Last year, the UN admitted to fraud, they had that meeting and then boom, this comes
[2:21:12.180 --> 2:21:13.180]  out.
[2:21:13.180 --> 2:21:16.180]  We'll be right back.
[2:21:16.180 --> 2:21:28.180]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[2:21:28.180 --> 2:21:42.420]  Infowars has been banned, arrested, attacked and threatened because we are effective.
[2:21:42.420 --> 2:21:44.380]  The great awakening is here.
[2:21:44.380 --> 2:21:58.140]  Go to banned.video, download the videos and share, support the information war at infowarstore.com
[2:21:58.140 --> 2:22:17.820]  I don't want to be right about this prediction.
[2:22:17.820 --> 2:22:20.460]  In fact, it's not a prediction.
[2:22:20.460 --> 2:22:25.780]  It is a forecast that we continue down the economic road we're on globally with the
[2:22:25.780 --> 2:22:29.700]  ongoing COVID-19 lockdowns and the structure of productivity.
[2:22:29.700 --> 2:22:33.780]  It will continue to accelerate these ripple effects that are breaking down supply chains
[2:22:33.780 --> 2:22:38.900]  that will start tens of millions of additional people in the third world and destroy decades
[2:22:38.900 --> 2:22:41.380]  of human infrastructure that's been built.
[2:22:41.380 --> 2:22:46.020]  It will annihilate the funding of that and put the entire first world in even deeper
[2:22:46.020 --> 2:22:49.100]  debt, which we're being maneuvered into.
[2:22:49.100 --> 2:22:54.260]  I really think the smart move is to end all these lockdowns immediately and prosecute
[2:22:54.260 --> 2:23:00.180]  the people that launched the giant COVID scam, the giant COVID-con game that's really just
[2:23:00.180 --> 2:23:01.180]  a big power grab.
[2:23:01.180 --> 2:23:04.900]  But in case we can't reverse all this, we better start digging in and get storeable
[2:23:04.900 --> 2:23:08.420]  food and getting prepared to be self-sufficient because that's the name of their game is to
[2:23:08.420 --> 2:23:10.020]  make us dependent on them.
[2:23:10.020 --> 2:23:16.300]  So get self-sufficient now at infowars.com Ignorance does not equal bliss.
[2:23:16.300 --> 2:23:19.740]  Ignorance equals slavery.
[2:23:19.740 --> 2:23:24.340]  If you're ignorant walking through a field at night that there's a six-foot pole up ahead,
[2:23:24.340 --> 2:23:27.740]  you're going to step in it and probably break your ankle, or maybe worse.
[2:23:27.740 --> 2:23:31.660]  Well, it's the same thing happening to human civilization.
[2:23:31.660 --> 2:23:36.220]  The industrialized age really empowered humanity in many respects, but also took us away from
[2:23:36.220 --> 2:23:40.180]  the land and made us very, very domesticated and very, very easy to manipulate.
[2:23:40.180 --> 2:23:44.460]  And now corruption and predatory activity can hide behind that complexity.
[2:23:44.460 --> 2:23:49.260]  Now I know what's going on behind the complexity because I go read what the UN and the Rockefeller
[2:23:49.260 --> 2:23:54.100]  Foundation and the Davos Group and the Bilderberg Group and all their subsidiaries like the
[2:23:54.100 --> 2:23:55.900]  Club of Rome say.
[2:23:55.900 --> 2:23:59.220]  So I know exactly what's going on.
[2:23:59.220 --> 2:24:03.820]  Not because I'm even that cool or special a person, but I'm actually want to be empowered
[2:24:03.820 --> 2:24:06.100]  and informed because I'm a history buff.
[2:24:06.100 --> 2:24:08.700]  I know that those that don't know history don't repeat it.
[2:24:08.700 --> 2:24:09.820]  The globalists think you're stupid.
[2:24:09.820 --> 2:24:16.580]  They laugh at you because you won't research their own admissions.
[2:24:16.580 --> 2:24:31.620]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:24:31.620 --> 2:24:32.620]  The Alex Jones show.
[2:24:32.620 --> 2:24:36.900]  The reading of frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[2:24:36.900 --> 2:24:37.900]  It's Alex Jones.
[2:24:37.900 --> 2:24:40.340]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[2:24:40.340 --> 2:24:42.340]  Dr. Sherry Tinpin is our guest.
[2:24:42.340 --> 2:24:47.540]  When I start the next hour, I'm going to do a couple of segments on the founders of BLM
[2:24:47.540 --> 2:24:50.900]  saying we're conducting witchcraft.
[2:24:50.900 --> 2:24:54.820]  There's video of this killing of people gives us power.
[2:24:54.820 --> 2:25:02.620]  This is this is Jim Jones, Charlie Manson, Hillside Strangler, cuckoo stuff.
[2:25:02.620 --> 2:25:04.020]  But this is all breaking.
[2:25:04.020 --> 2:25:06.620]  It's coming up next hour and the spiritual fight.
[2:25:06.620 --> 2:25:11.220]  Trump has come out and pointed out Biden constantly groves little kids and women and
[2:25:11.220 --> 2:25:12.220]  does bizarre stuff.
[2:25:12.220 --> 2:25:15.420]  Trump said he's taken the gloves off after the fake Atlantic article will play that
[2:25:15.420 --> 2:25:16.420]  video clip.
[2:25:16.420 --> 2:25:18.620]  It's posted on infowars.com.
[2:25:18.620 --> 2:25:19.620]  We start the next hour.
[2:25:19.620 --> 2:25:25.180]  President Trump highlights Biden's creepy groping with hashtag Pito Joe tweet and so
[2:25:25.180 --> 2:25:26.180]  much more.
[2:25:26.180 --> 2:25:27.180]  That's coming up.
[2:25:27.180 --> 2:25:31.900]  Dr. Sherry Tinpin, obviously the power structure knows there's a global awakening.
[2:25:31.900 --> 2:25:33.020]  They want to lock things down.
[2:25:33.020 --> 2:25:34.020]  They want a global depression.
[2:25:34.020 --> 2:25:37.420]  The head of the Debo script says this is a global reset.
[2:25:37.420 --> 2:25:38.740]  So you brought up 100 points.
[2:25:38.740 --> 2:25:39.740]  They've all been fascinating.
[2:25:39.740 --> 2:25:42.740]  There's a medical doctor as a leader in exposing this.
[2:25:42.740 --> 2:25:44.140]  I'm going to shut up the next nine minutes.
[2:25:44.140 --> 2:25:45.140]  You've got the floor.
[2:25:45.140 --> 2:25:48.780]  Get into all the subjects, all the points, the mask.
[2:25:48.780 --> 2:25:51.820]  Why do you think Trump's saying, oh, I've got this vaccine instead of that?
[2:25:51.820 --> 2:25:53.820]  You've got the floor unfiltered, uncensored.
[2:25:53.820 --> 2:25:54.820]  Go ahead.
[2:25:54.820 --> 2:25:56.300]  Well, thank you, Alex.
[2:25:56.300 --> 2:25:57.620]  Thank you so much.
[2:25:57.620 --> 2:26:02.380]  It's you're absolutely right in everything that you said today and what you've been saying.
[2:26:02.380 --> 2:26:08.460]  You know, masks are the first are.
[2:26:08.460 --> 2:26:11.540]  There's probably three categories of people with masks, the obedient people that just
[2:26:11.540 --> 2:26:13.180]  shut up and do what they're told.
[2:26:13.180 --> 2:26:16.380]  And then there's the people that are compliant that they're doing it, even though they know
[2:26:16.380 --> 2:26:19.980]  that something's right, not right, and they don't want to do it, but they're kind of doing
[2:26:19.980 --> 2:26:21.340]  it right now just to get along.
[2:26:21.340 --> 2:26:25.380]  And then there's the people who are forced to do it, like people for their employment.
[2:26:25.380 --> 2:26:27.660]  We have to understand what the masks are actually doing.
[2:26:27.660 --> 2:26:31.260]  It's doing nothing more than making the person who's wearing them sick.
[2:26:31.260 --> 2:26:35.660]  We're lowering their O2, increasing their CO2, we're actually causing this thing now
[2:26:35.660 --> 2:26:40.060]  called mask mouth, which is causing horrible things to their dentition.
[2:26:40.060 --> 2:26:44.060]  And I like to use this example of saying we've got this mask dermatitis now of people that
[2:26:44.060 --> 2:26:47.460]  are wearing these masks all day and they're ending up with this horrible rash and sort
[2:26:47.460 --> 2:26:52.020]  of like infection on their face because they're spitting on their face all day long.
[2:26:52.020 --> 2:26:55.940]  You know, as they talk and those masks get moist and particularly the cloth ones are
[2:26:55.940 --> 2:27:00.500]  the worst and they collect the bacteria and viruses that are in their mouth.
[2:27:00.500 --> 2:27:03.140]  It's like spitting on your face all day long.
[2:27:03.140 --> 2:27:08.380]  And then wondering why in the world that there's a big problem.
[2:27:08.380 --> 2:27:10.580]  And so masks need to go.
[2:27:10.580 --> 2:27:11.580]  It's a mouth diaper.
[2:27:11.580 --> 2:27:12.580]  Sorry.
[2:27:12.580 --> 2:27:13.580]  I mean, it's a mouth diaper.
[2:27:13.580 --> 2:27:14.580]  Yep.
[2:27:14.580 --> 2:27:15.580]  Exactly.
[2:27:15.580 --> 2:27:16.580]  Yes.
[2:27:16.580 --> 2:27:17.580]  Exactly.
[2:27:17.580 --> 2:27:20.980]  And so, and then that coupled with the social distancing, the social distancing, the two
[2:27:20.980 --> 2:27:23.740]  meter mark is a military thing.
[2:27:23.740 --> 2:27:30.140]  And so because they can't have an individual energetic imprint of us, we're clustered together
[2:27:30.140 --> 2:27:31.980]  closely with a bunch of people.
[2:27:31.980 --> 2:27:34.900]  And so we've got everybody's social distancing.
[2:27:34.900 --> 2:27:38.260]  The first time I heard that, Alex, I was standing in the break room at my office.
[2:27:38.260 --> 2:27:41.260]  I still see patients two days a week in my office.
[2:27:41.260 --> 2:27:42.260]  And I was standing in the break room.
[2:27:42.260 --> 2:27:43.260]  It's the first time I heard it.
[2:27:43.260 --> 2:27:48.540]  And I said, please tell me that this is not going to become part of our language lexicon
[2:27:48.540 --> 2:27:52.860]  that we're suddenly now this is social distancing is going to become something we talk about
[2:27:52.860 --> 2:27:54.740]  and we embrace like these masks.
[2:27:54.740 --> 2:27:56.380]  And sure enough, here we are.
[2:27:56.380 --> 2:27:58.940]  I mean, everybody talks about it all the time.
[2:27:58.940 --> 2:28:02.580]  And it's really just this two meter thing is being able to have an individual imprint
[2:28:02.580 --> 2:28:07.100]  on us for the artificial intelligence and the transhumanism things that they're moving
[2:28:07.100 --> 2:28:08.100]  towards.
[2:28:08.100 --> 2:28:12.740]  So the social distancing, and now we got legalized spying on each other that we give a fancy
[2:28:12.740 --> 2:28:18.060]  name called contact tracing, instead of just calling it for what it is, the brown shirt
[2:28:18.060 --> 2:28:23.940]  movement of spying on your neighbor and getting paid to do it no less.
[2:28:23.940 --> 2:28:28.460]  And so this whole COVID thing is just leading up to and it's getting everybody into this
[2:28:28.460 --> 2:28:33.420]  obedience place of just doing what I'm told and they're feeling so depressed, you know,
[2:28:33.420 --> 2:28:36.980]  and I know that you know this and you talk about this, that the people that, I mean,
[2:28:36.980 --> 2:28:43.460]  the rate of suicide, the rate of death from malnutrition is greater than the sum total
[2:28:43.460 --> 2:28:47.340]  of all the people who have died from this infection from this virus.
[2:28:47.340 --> 2:28:50.860]  And so people are so crushed down with their business, with their economics, with their
[2:28:50.860 --> 2:28:55.380]  family situation, with their businesses, they may have been torched by Black Lives Matter.
[2:28:55.380 --> 2:28:58.820]  They may have been vandalized by all these people walking down the street, smashing
[2:28:58.820 --> 2:29:03.900]  in and burning their buildings, that they're saying, okay, if I could just get this vaccine,
[2:29:03.900 --> 2:29:07.780]  if I could just get the vaccine and kind of get somewhat back to normal and I can go to
[2:29:07.780 --> 2:29:12.060]  a restaurant and go to the grocery store, they're just leading, they're being led like
[2:29:12.060 --> 2:29:15.900]  sleep sheep to the slaughter, Alex, it just, you know, what's coming through going to
[2:29:15.900 --> 2:29:18.940]  come in this vaccine is going to be horrific.
[2:29:18.940 --> 2:29:23.500]  The messenger RNA type of vaccine that they're actually creating has never been created for
[2:29:23.500 --> 2:29:25.620]  humans before ever.
[2:29:25.620 --> 2:29:30.500]  They could never, they've been trying to develop a coronavirus vaccine since 2002.
[2:29:30.500 --> 2:29:34.700]  They couldn't move it forward in the FDA, even to human trials, because all the animals
[2:29:34.700 --> 2:29:37.540]  either got horribly sick or died.
[2:29:37.540 --> 2:29:39.340]  They couldn't do human trials before.
[2:29:39.340 --> 2:29:42.900]  So now we've skipped the animal studies, because we know what's going to happen to the animals.
[2:29:42.900 --> 2:29:45.740]  We're going to go straight to human studies.
[2:29:45.740 --> 2:29:49.740]  And the people that they're enrolling in these studies are the healthiest of the healthy.
[2:29:49.740 --> 2:29:55.100]  No medications, no preexisting conditions, a perfect body weight.
[2:29:55.100 --> 2:29:59.140]  They're the perfect, they're in the 30, 40 age group, but yet when they decide that this
[2:29:59.140 --> 2:30:04.260]  vaccine is safe and going to be protective, they will advocate it for everyone.
[2:30:04.260 --> 2:30:08.980]  People that have cancer at the elderly, I actually even heard today that there's that
[2:30:08.980 --> 2:30:12.100]  part of the book of the Monerta vaccine trials.
[2:30:12.100 --> 2:30:17.020]  They're actually studying on children, 12 to 14 year old children in the UK.
[2:30:17.020 --> 2:30:18.460]  They're going to want this to be everything.
[2:30:18.460 --> 2:30:24.340]  You know, we've all heard the clips of Bill Gates saying, yes, all 7.2 billion people
[2:30:24.340 --> 2:30:27.460]  in the world need at least two doses of this vaccine.
[2:30:27.460 --> 2:30:32.220]  So we're talking trillions of dollars at risk here, trillions of dollars at getting this
[2:30:32.220 --> 2:30:34.460]  vaccine into everyone.
[2:30:34.460 --> 2:30:39.980]  That will be laced with something called hydrogel, which is a nanotechnology that once it's in
[2:30:39.980 --> 2:30:42.220]  your body, you cannot get it out.
[2:30:42.220 --> 2:30:47.900]  It's unlike the other vaccines that you can detox from mercury or aluminum or the chemicals,
[2:30:47.900 --> 2:30:52.460]  or you can get healthier by neutralizing some of the, maybe the viral particles.
[2:30:52.460 --> 2:31:00.580]  But this COVID-19 vaccine for the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which they've never been able to identify,
[2:31:00.580 --> 2:31:02.700]  it doesn't follow COX postulates.
[2:31:02.700 --> 2:31:06.700]  It doesn't have any of, they haven't mapped the entire genome out yet.
[2:31:06.700 --> 2:31:11.180]  We have stopped the entire world over nothing that we can prove.
[2:31:11.180 --> 2:31:15.500]  And yet they want us to be vaccinated with this, that you will not be able to detox from
[2:31:15.500 --> 2:31:16.500]  this.
[2:31:16.500 --> 2:31:17.500]  It just won't happen.
[2:31:17.500 --> 2:31:18.900]  It won't be possible.
[2:31:18.900 --> 2:31:19.900]  What's the big picture?
[2:31:19.900 --> 2:31:26.780]  I mean, this is mass medical experimentation, waving animal trials, this is just a big pharma
[2:31:26.780 --> 2:31:27.780]  takeover.
[2:31:27.780 --> 2:31:34.020]  Yes, I feel like in my personal opinion, this is just my opinion, there are three primary
[2:31:34.020 --> 2:31:35.260]  things at play here.
[2:31:35.260 --> 2:31:42.460]  Number one is a complete reset of the global economic system, the global economic system.
[2:31:42.460 --> 2:31:47.300]  They're trying to get us to a cashless society, which they've been gunning towards for quite
[2:31:47.300 --> 2:31:48.300]  a while.
[2:31:48.300 --> 2:31:54.940]  It's a re-upset of the entire global economic system, which my good friend, Katherine Austin
[2:31:54.940 --> 2:31:59.300]  Fitz, talks about a lot, and she's really got that whole sector nailed down.
[2:31:59.300 --> 2:32:04.660]  I think the second thing is a human experimentation that's moving us towards artificial intelligence
[2:32:04.660 --> 2:32:06.820]  and the transhumanism movement.
[2:32:06.820 --> 2:32:12.300]  And then the third thing, coupled right with the other two, is all the people at the top
[2:32:12.300 --> 2:32:16.500]  of this ladder, I mean, they're eugenicists, and I believe many of them are Satanists.
[2:32:16.500 --> 2:32:19.900]  And they want, and the whole depopulation agenda is alive and well.
[2:32:19.900 --> 2:32:23.940]  I mean, we have kind of avoided, at least I personally have kind of avoided talking
[2:32:23.940 --> 2:32:28.700]  about those things over the years, Alex, because people thought we were crazy enough
[2:32:28.700 --> 2:32:34.300]  to just question vaccines and say, wait, stop, what's coming through that needle?
[2:32:34.300 --> 2:32:38.500]  To get people to just start questioning was a big enough leap.
[2:32:38.500 --> 2:32:43.140]  To take them down the road to what this whole vaccination movement really is, it's about
[2:32:43.140 --> 2:32:48.100]  an economic thing, it's injecting foreign matter into children and adults to make them
[2:32:48.100 --> 2:32:51.020]  sick so that they can really sell them, really make them healthy drugs.
[2:32:51.020 --> 2:32:55.140]  And you have to have it to buy and sell, and it's an excuse for the social credit score
[2:32:55.140 --> 2:32:58.660]  to track you, and they admit it's going to hurt you, but they coerce you to do it.
[2:32:58.660 --> 2:33:02.900]  This is the greatest cult takeover, it's just cult programming.
[2:33:02.900 --> 2:33:03.900]  It is.
[2:33:03.900 --> 2:33:08.420]  And you know, the vaccines have always been the economic loss leader of the entire sector.
[2:33:08.420 --> 2:33:13.300]  I mean, they're not very expensive, and you can get them for free at the health department
[2:33:13.300 --> 2:33:16.500]  or they'll come into your place of work and give you a free flu shot.
[2:33:16.500 --> 2:33:22.020]  And so, but where the real money is to be made is the big trillion dollar book of business
[2:33:22.020 --> 2:33:27.820]  where they sell you all these drugs in order to treat the side effects caused by the vaccines.
[2:33:27.820 --> 2:33:32.820]  So this is the same game, except this vaccine is going to be much more deadly.
[2:33:32.820 --> 2:33:33.820]  That's right.
[2:33:33.820 --> 2:33:35.140]  I mean, we'll talk about when we come back.
[2:33:35.140 --> 2:33:40.100]  This is on TV going, OK, 700,000 people are going to get sick or die, OK, 80% are getting
[2:33:40.100 --> 2:33:43.820]  sick taking the inoculation, 20% go to the hospital.
[2:33:43.820 --> 2:33:46.780]  They're not even lying now.
[2:33:46.780 --> 2:33:53.340]  They're saying we're going to hurt you in these new vaccines that go in and change the DNA,
[2:33:53.340 --> 2:33:54.740]  that go in and change the nuclei.
[2:33:54.740 --> 2:33:57.420]  They don't train the body how to defeat them.
[2:33:57.420 --> 2:34:02.140]  They go in and change what the cells produce as proteins, and I'm no medical doctor like
[2:34:02.140 --> 2:34:06.540]  I'm sure it's him, but even I read a lot of times when cells start creating random proteins,
[2:34:06.540 --> 2:34:07.540]  it's called cancer.
[2:34:07.540 --> 2:34:08.540]  We'll be right back.
[2:34:08.540 --> 2:34:09.540]  Stay with us.
[2:34:09.540 --> 2:34:18.580]  There is a metaphysical rule that God has put in place that controls the universe and
[2:34:18.580 --> 2:34:20.300]  it's free will.
[2:34:20.300 --> 2:34:24.940]  That's why the social engineers, the Robert Barrett's, the globalist, the post humanist,
[2:34:24.940 --> 2:34:31.700]  the anti humans openly tell you what they're doing and openly tell you that you're worthless
[2:34:31.700 --> 2:34:34.700]  and crap and you need to die because that will save the earth.
[2:34:34.700 --> 2:34:39.860]  They do everything they can to make the most dystopian, ugly future they can in the movies
[2:34:39.860 --> 2:34:43.100]  and in the culture and in all the different publications.
[2:34:43.100 --> 2:34:44.780]  They are making you hate yourself.
[2:34:44.780 --> 2:34:46.660]  They are making you be depressed.
[2:34:46.660 --> 2:34:50.060]  They are making you not have a connection to God because they just want you to die so
[2:34:50.060 --> 2:34:51.500]  they can selfishly control the future.
[2:34:51.500 --> 2:34:53.500]  And that's what all this is about.
[2:34:53.500 --> 2:34:58.060]  They say they're setting up world government to protect us all from our super technologies.
[2:34:58.060 --> 2:35:02.100]  While they're the ones running around like mad scientist, endangering the whole planet
[2:35:02.100 --> 2:35:07.580]  with a lot of these technologies, the globalist are what is disruptive to human species.
[2:35:07.580 --> 2:35:10.500]  They call us disruptive to their power grab.
[2:35:10.500 --> 2:35:12.580]  It's time to say no.
[2:35:12.580 --> 2:35:18.220]  The clock is ticking on the once free world and the free press is under attack more than
[2:35:18.220 --> 2:35:19.220]  ever.
[2:35:19.220 --> 2:35:25.020]  I now see videos 10 or 15 times a day without even trying to find them of press being arrested
[2:35:25.020 --> 2:35:29.060]  in the United States, press being arrested in Canada, the UK, Europe, Australia, New
[2:35:29.060 --> 2:35:30.060]  Zealand.
[2:35:30.060 --> 2:35:34.820]  And it's always the so-called liberal left, the defenders of speech doing it.
[2:35:34.820 --> 2:35:36.540]  They are the authoritarians.
[2:35:36.540 --> 2:35:42.820]  They work for the CHICOM Globalist Combine and they are working around the clock to
[2:35:42.820 --> 2:35:44.780]  silence info wars.
[2:35:44.780 --> 2:35:48.860]  Just as we were the group they started with three years ago, they test out everything
[2:35:48.860 --> 2:35:52.860]  new on us and a lot of what I can't get into on air at this point, I'll be able to reveal
[2:35:52.860 --> 2:35:57.660]  this later, but I just want to make you all realize that your support, your word of mouth,
[2:35:57.660 --> 2:36:01.660]  your prayer is absolutely essential and I thank you all for it.
[2:36:01.660 --> 2:36:05.900]  But whatever you do, take advantage of the great products that support the info war
[2:36:05.900 --> 2:36:09.420]  and make your life healthier and better at infowarstore.com.
[2:36:09.420 --> 2:36:11.540]  Please go to infowarstore.com today.
[2:36:11.540 --> 2:36:16.860]  You've always had a pledge from me and it's that I'll come to you with the truth, at
[2:36:16.860 --> 2:36:22.020]  least as good as my human temporal truth can get because as the Bible says we all see
[2:36:22.020 --> 2:36:27.980]  through a rose-colored darkly kind of a foggy lens that distorts what we actually can perceive
[2:36:27.980 --> 2:36:31.260]  so that everything we do is actually a fallen sin.
[2:36:31.260 --> 2:36:34.140]  Everything we do is actually a twisted distortion of God's will.
[2:36:34.140 --> 2:36:38.220]  So when I tell you I'm telling you the truth, it's the best truth this fallen creature's
[2:36:38.220 --> 2:36:39.220]  got.
[2:36:39.220 --> 2:36:44.500]  But I'll tell you it's all I got and when I tell you, this country and the world is
[2:36:44.500 --> 2:36:48.140]  under major satanic threat, you don't need me to tell you that.
[2:36:48.140 --> 2:36:51.900]  You can look out the window, you can look into your own family, you can turn on the news,
[2:36:51.900 --> 2:36:52.900]  you can see it.
[2:36:52.900 --> 2:36:57.380]  But you've got this commitment, I do recognize the truth of God and so do you and we're going
[2:36:57.380 --> 2:37:01.500]  to win this fight because it's going to be hard and I want to keep info wars in the main
[2:37:01.500 --> 2:37:05.500]  position to fight and it only happens when you support what you've been doing so again
[2:37:05.500 --> 2:37:10.940]  I thank you but go to infowarstore.com, buy the product, spread the word because that's
[2:37:10.940 --> 2:37:13.660]  how we're going to win and I thank you all.
[2:37:13.660 --> 2:37:17.740]  Introducing info wars life, pure turmeric extract.
[2:37:17.740 --> 2:37:24.060]  This is taken under the tongue, it is pure turmeric, it goes together very well with
[2:37:24.060 --> 2:37:29.340]  our body's ultimate turmeric formula that is taken as a powdered capsule and absorbed
[2:37:29.340 --> 2:37:31.740]  in the stomach and intestines.
[2:37:31.740 --> 2:37:35.900]  This is absorbed under the tongue into the bloodstream and then the remaining also is
[2:37:35.900 --> 2:37:40.060]  then absorbed by the stomach so it's more of an intense delivery system.
[2:37:40.060 --> 2:37:44.620]  The two formulas are different but both are concentrates and our first product got rave
[2:37:44.620 --> 2:37:45.620]  reviews.
[2:37:45.620 --> 2:37:49.540]  We've been testing this out for several months, some of our staff like it more than bodies,
[2:37:49.540 --> 2:37:53.900]  some like bodies better, for me they're both amazing for their anti-inflammatory action
[2:37:53.900 --> 2:37:56.180]  and so much more and they fund the info war.
[2:37:56.180 --> 2:38:02.100]  So get our new liquid turmeric extract exclusively at infowarstore.com today, an additional 25%
[2:38:02.100 --> 2:38:03.100]  off.
[2:38:03.100 --> 2:38:05.580]  This is a 360 win.
[2:38:05.580 --> 2:38:09.340]  Turmeric is renowned for what it does for all of our bodies, for inflammation and so
[2:38:09.340 --> 2:38:10.340]  much more.
[2:38:10.340 --> 2:38:37.020]  Get yours today at infowarslife.com.
[2:38:37.020 --> 2:38:45.780]  The answer to 1984 is 1776, you're listening to the Alex Jones show broadcasting from Austin
[2:38:45.780 --> 2:38:46.780]  Texas worldwide.
[2:38:46.780 --> 2:38:54.460]  Dr. Sherry Tinpin is our guest and then I'll be co-host for the next hour with an individual
[2:38:54.460 --> 2:39:00.540]  that's exposed the real roots of BLM prepared to be blown away.
[2:39:00.540 --> 2:39:06.020]  First off though, you see this big folder, I'll be covering this tomorrow of food starvation.
[2:39:06.020 --> 2:39:10.980]  The real killing of COVID-19 is how they use it for a lockdown, but you would admit it's
[2:39:10.980 --> 2:39:15.580]  a doubling in starvation every year, so instead of 10 million that'll be 20 million, so they're
[2:39:15.580 --> 2:39:20.500]  estimating an extra 8 million will die, 2 million less than it would be if it doubled,
[2:39:20.500 --> 2:39:23.540]  so instead of 10 million it's 18 million.
[2:39:23.540 --> 2:39:25.820]  It's not COVID doing that, it's the lockdown.
[2:39:25.820 --> 2:39:33.100]  So there's an article that's up on infowars.com and pull it up for you and it deals with massive
[2:39:33.100 --> 2:39:40.060]  lines from outside Virginia food bank, demand hits 1 million meals per month with nearly
[2:39:40.060 --> 2:39:44.220]  half going to Spanish speaking population.
[2:39:44.220 --> 2:39:48.780]  And so we brought in this giant 50, 60, 70 million illegal alien population, the economy
[2:39:48.780 --> 2:39:52.500]  shut down, they don't have food, talk about a time bomb.
[2:39:52.500 --> 2:39:57.060]  This again is the globalist model, bring in people they control, not to empower them,
[2:39:57.060 --> 2:39:58.060]  but to enslave them.
[2:39:58.060 --> 2:40:02.100]  There's some of the video, miles and miles and miles and miles of lines.
[2:40:02.100 --> 2:40:07.460]  This is what the globalists have done and if the lockdown continues, the world depression
[2:40:07.460 --> 2:40:10.140]  is going to be one of the worst ever seen, it's already going to happen whether Trump
[2:40:10.140 --> 2:40:11.140]  wins or not.
[2:40:11.140 --> 2:40:15.420]  I would get storeable food now, it's a no brainer at infowars.com, it's one to two weeks
[2:40:15.420 --> 2:40:19.620]  to ship, we have it in stock, it's got to be packaged, it's fresh from five factories
[2:40:19.620 --> 2:40:25.060]  and shipping centers around the United States to our long term sponsor infowars.com, get
[2:40:25.060 --> 2:40:28.260]  your storeable food now separately.
[2:40:28.260 --> 2:40:33.820]  We have a big special running right now on DNA Force Plus, Winner's Son, Prostigar that
[2:40:33.820 --> 2:40:35.260]  has the zinc and the palmetto.
[2:40:35.260 --> 2:40:39.220]  All this is great for your immune system on a regular basis, what we've been educated
[2:40:39.220 --> 2:40:44.940]  here on is how important it is to take these vitamins and minerals and 1776 for all of
[2:40:44.940 --> 2:40:50.140]  the t-shirts with free shipping infowars.com.
[2:40:50.140 --> 2:40:53.900]  And that's how we stay on air, so I want to thank you all for your support to get information
[2:40:53.900 --> 2:40:54.900]  like this.
[2:40:54.900 --> 2:40:59.180]  I want to thank Dr. Sherry Tenpenny, one of the main leaders out there exposing vaccines
[2:40:59.180 --> 2:41:03.020]  and what's really going on.
[2:41:03.020 --> 2:41:04.020]  Force inoculations.
[2:41:04.020 --> 2:41:08.860]  I mean, Australia says they're going to do it, EU says they're going to try to do it.
[2:41:08.860 --> 2:41:11.700]  Here they're saying, oh, it'll be an app on your phone, you don't have to have a shot,
[2:41:11.700 --> 2:41:14.980]  you just can't go on a plane, can't go to a grocery store, can't live your life.
[2:41:14.980 --> 2:41:19.260]  We need to start forming the opposition to this now.
[2:41:19.260 --> 2:41:25.180]  Guys, turn her up for me, turn her audio for me.
[2:41:25.180 --> 2:41:29.580]  Dr. Dr. Tenpenny, we lost your audio for a moment, we're going to work on that, it might
[2:41:29.580 --> 2:41:31.980]  be her, it might be us, go ahead Dr. Tenpenny.
[2:41:31.980 --> 2:41:33.380]  Can you hear me now?
[2:41:33.380 --> 2:41:34.380]  I can, go ahead.
[2:41:34.380 --> 2:41:39.100]  Okay, so not only do we need to start this now, we're behind this, we're behind, we're
[2:41:39.100 --> 2:41:45.260]  very behind in terms of starting this opposition because, you know, and Alex, I listened to
[2:41:45.260 --> 2:41:49.900]  your commercial there about, you know, prayer, because the power of prayer is so important.
[2:41:49.900 --> 2:41:53.900]  I mean, if we need to put God right in the middle of this, because if we're just fighting
[2:41:53.900 --> 2:41:57.660]  human against human, we might as well just roll up our sleeves, take the vaccine, take
[2:41:57.660 --> 2:42:02.100]  the mark and be done with it, because they got us out-moneyed, out-numbered, out-powered,
[2:42:02.100 --> 2:42:06.420]  out-mediated, out-everything, but with God, all thing is possible.
[2:42:06.420 --> 2:42:12.660]  And I started a daily Instagram live, it's called Happy Hour with Dr. T, Happy Hour,
[2:42:12.660 --> 2:42:17.740]  it's on Instagram, it's Happy Hour with Dr. T, Happy Hour with Dr. T. And you can also
[2:42:17.740 --> 2:42:22.020]  find it at happyhourwithdrt.blogspot.com.
[2:42:22.020 --> 2:42:26.300]  And I do it every day, Monday through Friday, 6 o'clock to 6.30 Eastern Time.
[2:42:26.300 --> 2:42:27.820]  I hope people will come and join us.
[2:42:27.820 --> 2:42:32.940]  I set this aside as this a little spiritual place to get together.
[2:42:32.940 --> 2:42:37.540]  We share a beverage of tea, kombucha, coffee, whatever.
[2:42:37.540 --> 2:42:42.620]  We talk a little bit and then at 10 after 6, we share a word of God and we pray together.
[2:42:42.620 --> 2:42:47.980]  And we'll have anywhere from 300 to 1,500 people praying together for our country, for
[2:42:47.980 --> 2:42:50.540]  our president, for each of us to have our own sense of the phrase.
[2:42:50.540 --> 2:42:55.340]  And if they all told folks to tune in, it'd be 5,000, then 20,000, then 100,000.
[2:42:55.340 --> 2:42:59.180]  That's how we've had up to 5 million people on streams before they manned us.
[2:42:59.180 --> 2:43:04.620]  And so to have that core of 1,500, 3,000 people, Dr. T, is so beautiful and you have your training
[2:43:04.620 --> 2:43:07.100]  of doctors, how to recognize this.
[2:43:07.100 --> 2:43:10.780]  What do you make of the UN videos that came out in December of last year, where the head
[2:43:10.780 --> 2:43:15.100]  of the WHO vaccine program said, we don't test them, they're hurting people, doctors
[2:43:15.100 --> 2:43:16.100]  don't believe in it.
[2:43:16.100 --> 2:43:17.100]  And now I'm at that.
[2:43:17.100 --> 2:43:18.220]  That's why I wanted you on last week.
[2:43:18.220 --> 2:43:19.220]  We got you on.
[2:43:19.220 --> 2:43:26.020]  What about AP headline, polio vaccine, main cause of polio, Bill and Melinda Gates funding
[2:43:26.020 --> 2:43:27.020]  it?
[2:43:27.020 --> 2:43:28.780]  I mean, my God, talk about that.
[2:43:28.780 --> 2:43:34.380]  Well, when I first saw that video from the summit, you know, I watched the whole thing
[2:43:34.380 --> 2:43:38.580]  when Del Bigtree from Highwire put that whole thing out and I watched all of it.
[2:43:38.580 --> 2:43:42.900]  I was just jaw dropped and now Alex, like, you know, we've said, you know, I've done
[2:43:42.900 --> 2:43:46.260]  this for 20 years, 40,000 hours of my time.
[2:43:46.260 --> 2:43:49.060]  There's not much I don't know about this industry.
[2:43:49.060 --> 2:43:55.100]  And I listened to that entire, that entire seminar and was just absolutely jaw dropped
[2:43:55.100 --> 2:43:59.740]  20 hours, two days, the UN had been laying it all out.
[2:43:59.740 --> 2:44:00.740]  This is it.
[2:44:00.740 --> 2:44:04.220]  I mean, what I knew was they were doing that to cover their ass because they know the crimes
[2:44:04.220 --> 2:44:05.220]  they committed.
[2:44:05.220 --> 2:44:07.220]  They were admitting it all that like they didn't know.
[2:44:07.220 --> 2:44:08.780]  That's what that was.
[2:44:08.780 --> 2:44:09.780]  Absolutely.
[2:44:09.780 --> 2:44:14.740]  And if they, but if people didn't understand from that point, and you know, then we rolled
[2:44:14.740 --> 2:44:18.980]  into COVID in all the things that we've been doing, that was in what November, December
[2:44:18.980 --> 2:44:20.220]  of last year.
[2:44:20.220 --> 2:44:24.100]  And then it was February, March when we started into like this global shutdown in March and
[2:44:24.100 --> 2:44:25.100]  April.
[2:44:25.100 --> 2:44:30.220]  I mean, the lack of people being able to get their head around these things and embrace
[2:44:30.220 --> 2:44:33.460]  the fact that we are being manipulated, controlled.
[2:44:33.460 --> 2:44:36.580]  All this thing is about a power grab and about grabbing our money, our health.
[2:44:36.580 --> 2:44:37.580]  Well, you just said it.
[2:44:37.580 --> 2:44:41.300]  So you're a big business owner, a big medical doctor and author, you know, smart lady.
[2:44:41.300 --> 2:44:43.660]  So I say that because I respect your view.
[2:44:43.660 --> 2:44:47.660]  Clearly it's CYA, Gates goes, oh, this is going to hurt a lot of people.
[2:44:47.660 --> 2:44:49.060]  Yeah, it's going to kill some people.
[2:44:49.060 --> 2:44:50.060]  You're still going to take it.
[2:44:50.060 --> 2:44:52.060]  They know they can't cover up the damage now.
[2:44:52.060 --> 2:44:53.460]  They're just saying they're going to do it.
[2:44:53.460 --> 2:44:55.420]  That's what people like, oh, they're admitting the truth.
[2:44:55.420 --> 2:44:58.060]  No, they're getting ready to rape us.
[2:44:58.060 --> 2:44:59.460]  Absolutely.
[2:44:59.460 --> 2:45:00.980]  And it's, and it's, and it's the rollout.
[2:45:00.980 --> 2:45:05.420]  I mean, if you go to weforum.org, weforum.org and you look at it.
[2:45:05.420 --> 2:45:09.340]  I mean, they read the first little four minute video says we've been planning this for 50
[2:45:09.340 --> 2:45:11.500]  years, five, zero, 50 years.
[2:45:11.500 --> 2:45:12.500]  And here we are.
[2:45:12.500 --> 2:45:17.220]  And we're putting this all together and the complexity of that website is it's, it's
[2:45:17.220 --> 2:45:18.220]  talk about that.
[2:45:18.220 --> 2:45:19.220]  The pre-planning.
[2:45:19.220 --> 2:45:21.820]  It's not just the Rockefeller Foundation and lockstep.
[2:45:21.820 --> 2:45:23.660]  This is a long-term strategic.
[2:45:23.660 --> 2:45:24.660]  This is just about vaccines.
[2:45:24.660 --> 2:45:27.980]  This is a casual society, tracking systems, total control.
[2:45:27.980 --> 2:45:29.300]  This is it.
[2:45:29.300 --> 2:45:33.940]  This is it in every industry you can think of, from every element that you can think
[2:45:33.940 --> 2:45:38.820]  of, from economic, from spiritual, I mean, we can go and march in a Black Lives Matter
[2:45:38.820 --> 2:45:44.380]  protest, but we can't go to church, you know, we can't go to a wedding.
[2:45:44.380 --> 2:45:45.380]  We can't go to a funeral.
[2:45:45.380 --> 2:45:49.420]  We can't have a gathering, even in your own home, to be able to have a Bible study or
[2:45:49.420 --> 2:45:52.260]  to pray, but you can go march on the street.
[2:45:52.260 --> 2:45:57.780]  This is selective martial law by the United Nations, global cabal.
[2:45:57.780 --> 2:45:58.780]  Exactly.
[2:45:58.780 --> 2:46:01.540]  That's, that sums it up exactly.
[2:46:01.540 --> 2:46:07.180]  It's wild to be living it though, like, we could predict it was coming, but now, tell
[2:46:07.180 --> 2:46:08.180]  us about the group.
[2:46:08.180 --> 2:46:11.700]  I didn't even know about that group that's bragging they planted for 50 years.
[2:46:11.700 --> 2:46:17.260]  That's weforum.org, weforum.org is where you need to go, and it's everything that you
[2:46:17.260 --> 2:46:18.260]  need to know.
[2:46:18.260 --> 2:46:22.500]  In fact, Alex, it's so depressing to go and read that site, I've actually made a commitment
[2:46:22.500 --> 2:46:26.980]  to myself, I won't spend more than maybe an hour a week there, because every week they
[2:46:26.980 --> 2:46:29.020]  come out with another angle.
[2:46:29.020 --> 2:46:35.620]  There's another site, it's called biologos.org, B-I-O, and then the word logos, L-O-G-O-S,
[2:46:35.620 --> 2:46:36.620]  biologos.org.
[2:46:36.620 --> 2:46:38.100]  Oh yeah, so it's the World Economic Forum.
[2:46:38.100 --> 2:46:40.860]  Yeah, they admit it's a total takeover, yeah.
[2:46:40.860 --> 2:46:46.980]  And then you go to biologos.org, and they are taking Christianity and turning it into
[2:46:46.980 --> 2:46:47.980]  scientism.
[2:46:47.980 --> 2:46:53.180]  They're saying, you know, they want Christians to sign a pledge to always wear a mask to
[2:46:53.180 --> 2:46:59.180]  get vaccinated, to support social justice, and to put down any sort of misinformation
[2:46:59.180 --> 2:47:00.780]  that goes against our scientists.
[2:47:00.780 --> 2:47:05.220]  And then big tech is blocking medical doctors and even U.S. think tanks from questioning
[2:47:05.220 --> 2:47:06.220]  it.
[2:47:06.220 --> 2:47:07.220]  I mean, this is their big move.
[2:47:07.220 --> 2:47:08.220]  This is it.
[2:47:08.220 --> 2:47:09.220]  This is it.
[2:47:09.220 --> 2:47:10.380]  This is our Waterloo, Alex.
[2:47:10.380 --> 2:47:15.540]  This is something that you and I have been talking about together, and on our respective
[2:47:15.540 --> 2:47:17.540]  platforms for 20 years.
[2:47:17.540 --> 2:47:21.980]  We are at the point now, it's we either win or this is winter loose.
[2:47:21.980 --> 2:47:28.100]  And so everybody needs to do more than just, like, get awake, they need to get active.
[2:47:28.100 --> 2:47:33.700]  They need to start deciding which side of the line are they going to stand on.
[2:47:33.700 --> 2:47:38.420]  And the time to make a decision about what you're going to do about mandatory vaccines,
[2:47:38.420 --> 2:47:42.460]  about contact tracing, is not when the people knock at your door.
[2:47:42.460 --> 2:47:43.860]  You need to know ahead of time how you're going to start that.
[2:47:43.860 --> 2:47:47.340]  You've got to be organizing the neighborhood and giving them this interview that's live,
[2:47:47.340 --> 2:47:49.420]  but it'll be archived soon to Bandai Video.
[2:47:49.420 --> 2:47:50.700]  You've got to do it now, folks.
[2:47:50.700 --> 2:47:53.180]  You're going to, I'm telling you, everything else was preparatory.
[2:47:53.180 --> 2:47:54.180]  You're right.
[2:47:54.180 --> 2:47:55.180]  The collapse has happened.
[2:47:55.180 --> 2:47:56.540]  This is the main assault.
[2:47:56.540 --> 2:47:57.740]  And I look at it as the Battle of the Bulge.
[2:47:57.740 --> 2:47:58.740]  The Nazis were losing.
[2:47:58.740 --> 2:48:00.300]  They launched a counter offensive.
[2:48:00.300 --> 2:48:03.100]  I see this as their Battle of the Bulge Waterloo, you name it.
[2:48:03.100 --> 2:48:05.740]  I just hope that we're Lord Wellington and they're Napoleon.
[2:48:05.740 --> 2:48:07.900]  Dr. Sherry Tinpinny, you are incredible.
[2:48:07.900 --> 2:48:09.260]  I know you're a busy lady.
[2:48:09.260 --> 2:48:12.060]  Come back and join us in a couple weeks to give us updates.
[2:48:12.060 --> 2:48:13.940]  We really, really appreciate you.
[2:48:13.940 --> 2:48:16.860]  And again, what's the best website for people to visit?
[2:48:16.860 --> 2:48:20.420]  Go to vaxter.com and think about signing up for our boot camp course.
[2:48:20.420 --> 2:48:25.420]  We only do it twice a year, masteringvaccineinfo.com forward slash boot camp.
[2:48:25.420 --> 2:48:26.420]  All right.
[2:48:26.420 --> 2:48:28.140]  Obviously, you can talk for five hours.
[2:48:28.140 --> 2:48:29.140]  Please go on David.
[2:48:29.140 --> 2:48:30.140]  I show.
[2:48:30.140 --> 2:48:31.140]  Please go on a shorter show.
[2:48:31.140 --> 2:48:32.260]  Come on our other shows and lay it out.
[2:48:32.260 --> 2:48:33.260]  We love you.
[2:48:33.260 --> 2:48:34.260]  We appreciate you.
[2:48:34.260 --> 2:48:35.260]  Amazing.
[2:48:35.260 --> 2:48:36.260]  Thank you so much, Alex.
[2:48:36.260 --> 2:48:37.260]  Thank you so much.
[2:48:37.260 --> 2:48:38.260]  Thank you.
[2:48:38.260 --> 2:48:41.060]  Well, that was the best interview ever with her because of the quickening here.
[2:48:41.060 --> 2:48:42.060]  There's no more games.
[2:48:42.060 --> 2:48:43.060]  We know we're right.
[2:48:43.060 --> 2:48:44.060]  She'd be on 20 years ago.
[2:48:44.060 --> 2:48:45.300]  I'd be questioning what we're doing.
[2:48:45.300 --> 2:48:46.300]  I thought we were right.
[2:48:46.300 --> 2:48:47.300]  You were right.
[2:48:47.300 --> 2:48:48.300]  And then some.
[2:48:48.300 --> 2:48:49.300]  This is insane.
[2:48:49.300 --> 2:48:55.660]  All right, our number four coming up, Black Lives Matter founder admits it's a satanic
[2:48:55.660 --> 2:48:56.660]  ritual.
[2:48:56.660 --> 2:49:00.660]  Here's a big of Don Salazar article on infoawards.com.
[2:49:00.660 --> 2:49:06.980]  A little more than a decade ago, it happened in Salt Lake City, Utah.
[2:49:06.980 --> 2:49:11.820]  The public came out on a very clear day and looked up more than 60,000 feet.
[2:49:11.820 --> 2:49:19.540]  So what they thought was a giant UFO was actually a large DARPA government surveillance blimp.
[2:49:19.540 --> 2:49:24.180]  There were thousands of phone calls made of police departments, newspapers, TV stations
[2:49:24.180 --> 2:49:28.300]  thinking it was an alien craft when the public was told that it was a blimp, they didn't
[2:49:28.300 --> 2:49:29.300]  want to believe it.
[2:49:29.300 --> 2:49:34.300]  You see, they'd already told themselves it was a UFO, so they had cognitive distance.
[2:49:34.300 --> 2:49:39.580]  It's kind of like the fact that COVID-19 is hundreds of times weaker than the flu, let
[2:49:39.580 --> 2:49:43.620]  people still want to live in fear and wear a mask outside, even in their cars, even in
[2:49:43.620 --> 2:49:44.620]  their houses.
[2:49:44.620 --> 2:49:48.620]  Well, it happened again over New Jersey yesterday, the Goodyear blimp was out there with a big
[2:49:48.620 --> 2:49:53.340]  gumbo-tron TV screen on the side of it and had flashing lights on, just like an airplane.
[2:49:53.340 --> 2:49:57.940]  And the public thought it was a UFO and now the public still believes it was a UFO, and
[2:49:57.940 --> 2:49:58.940]  now they were told it wasn't.
[2:49:58.940 --> 2:50:04.380]  You see, that's called a highly suggestible group of slaves.
[2:50:04.380 --> 2:50:11.660]  You can watch a factory of robots being controlled by wireless internet commands, but if you
[2:50:11.660 --> 2:50:15.900]  were a person just 200 years ago and you saw that you think it was magic, you wouldn't
[2:50:15.900 --> 2:50:19.300]  even know really what the machines were or what was controlling them.
[2:50:19.300 --> 2:50:24.020]  So for that person, it would be spiritual or it would be something of the spirit.
[2:50:24.020 --> 2:50:28.380]  And it's similar to how ducks and butterflies and many other species of animal know how
[2:50:28.380 --> 2:50:32.140]  to fly thousands and thousands of miles back to the exact place where they were born.
[2:50:32.140 --> 2:50:36.780]  They're following magnetic lines, they have magnetic cells in their brains, we now know
[2:50:36.780 --> 2:50:39.860]  side of it what's going on, there's even a lot more than that.
[2:50:39.860 --> 2:50:43.580]  So when we talk about the spirit, we're talking about all the dark matter, we're talking about
[2:50:43.580 --> 2:50:45.660]  all the things you don't understand but we know it's there.
[2:50:45.660 --> 2:50:50.100]  And just like you can have a bunch of robots working off the wireless system, that's what's
[2:50:50.100 --> 2:50:56.060]  going on with this satanic transmission that's working through people and that's how this
[2:50:56.060 --> 2:51:00.540]  entity behind it all is able to direct it because it is a consciousness manipulated
[2:51:00.540 --> 2:51:06.980]  device of space-time continuum.
[2:51:06.980 --> 2:51:11.060]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:51:11.060 --> 2:51:15.500]  There is an extremely predatory group of people that go out of their way and even destroy
[2:51:15.500 --> 2:51:21.060]  their own self-interest and their own children to dumb people down, mutate people, poison
[2:51:21.060 --> 2:51:25.820]  people and turn us against each other, setting us up for an end of planet event.
[2:51:25.820 --> 2:51:31.900]  Now, the Bible says an off-world entity was marooned here by the Creator and because we
[2:51:31.900 --> 2:51:37.020]  have free will, that entity is allowed to try to trick us to destroy ourselves.
[2:51:37.020 --> 2:51:41.740]  Satan comes to kill, steal and destroy, he was cast out of heaven and I can tell you
[2:51:41.740 --> 2:51:46.300]  as I've been telling you for 20 plus years, none of the globalists, not the Rockefellers,
[2:51:46.300 --> 2:51:52.020]  not the Rocks, Childs, not Elon Musk, none of them believe that there's not other entities
[2:51:52.020 --> 2:51:56.740]  and a controller that they're rebelling against, that they believe they're going to break free
[2:51:56.740 --> 2:51:57.740]  from.
[2:51:57.740 --> 2:52:01.020]  You notice Elon Musk came out about six months after I was on Joe Rogan and he basically
[2:52:01.020 --> 2:52:03.940]  repeated everything I said about the establishment and what they believe.
[2:52:03.940 --> 2:52:05.740]  This is what they believe.
[2:52:05.740 --> 2:52:09.660]  The elite are all about transcendence and living forever and the secrets of the universe
[2:52:09.660 --> 2:52:13.620]  and they want to know all the some are good, some are bad, some are a mix.
[2:52:13.620 --> 2:52:17.260]  But the good ones don't ever want to organize, the bad ones don't want to organize because
[2:52:17.260 --> 2:52:19.020]  they lost after power.
[2:52:19.020 --> 2:52:22.940]  Social consciousnesses don't want to dominate other people, they want to empower them so
[2:52:22.940 --> 2:52:26.460]  they don't tend to get together until things are really late in the game, then they come
[2:52:26.460 --> 2:52:30.340]  together, evil's always defeated because good is so much stronger.
[2:52:30.340 --> 2:52:34.300]  And we're on this planet and Einstein's physics showed it, Max Planck's physics showed it,
[2:52:34.300 --> 2:52:37.980]  there's at least 12 dimensions and now that's why all the top scientists and billionaires
[2:52:37.980 --> 2:52:42.900]  are coming out saying it's a false hologram, it is artificial, the computers are scanning
[2:52:42.900 --> 2:52:48.100]  it and finding tension points where it's artificially projected and gravity's bleeding
[2:52:48.100 --> 2:52:50.700]  in to this universe.
[2:52:50.700 --> 2:52:52.740]  That's what they call dark matter.
[2:52:52.740 --> 2:52:57.780]  So we're like a thought or a dream that's a wisp in some computer program, some God's
[2:52:57.780 --> 2:53:00.740]  mind, whatever, they're proving it all, it's all coming out.
[2:53:00.740 --> 2:53:04.900]  There are many, many simulations.
[2:53:04.900 --> 2:53:09.940]  These simulations are, we might as well call them reality or you could call them multiverse.
[2:53:09.940 --> 2:53:13.220]  These simulations you believe are created like someone has manufactured.
[2:53:13.220 --> 2:53:14.860]  They're running on the substrate.
[2:53:14.860 --> 2:53:19.500]  There's like this sub-transmission zone below the third dimension that's just turned over
[2:53:19.500 --> 2:53:23.500]  to the most horrible things is what it resonates to and it's trying to get up into the third
[2:53:23.500 --> 2:53:28.500]  dimension that's just a basic level consciousness to launch into the next levels.
[2:53:28.500 --> 2:53:33.620]  And our species is already way up in the fifth, sixth dimension, consciously, our best people.
[2:53:33.620 --> 2:53:38.420]  But there's this big war trying to like basically destroy humanity because humanity has free
[2:53:38.420 --> 2:53:42.060]  will and there's a decision to which level we want to go to.
[2:53:42.060 --> 2:53:46.540]  We have free will, so evil's allowed to come and contend and not just good.
[2:53:46.540 --> 2:53:53.340]  And the elites themselves believe they're racing using human technology to try to take
[2:53:53.340 --> 2:53:58.460]  our best minds and build some type of breakaway civilization where they're going to merge
[2:53:58.460 --> 2:54:03.660]  with machines, transcend and break away from the failed species of this man, which is kind
[2:54:03.660 --> 2:54:07.820]  of like a false transmission because they're thinking what they are is ugly and bad, projecting
[2:54:07.820 --> 2:54:13.060]  on themselves instead of believing, no, it's a human test about building us up.
[2:54:13.060 --> 2:54:20.980]  Well that's the scenario, the merge scenario with AI is the one that seems like probably
[2:54:20.980 --> 2:54:21.980]  the best.
[2:54:21.980 --> 2:54:22.980]  For us.
[2:54:22.980 --> 2:54:23.980]  Yes.
[2:54:23.980 --> 2:54:27.620]  Like if you can't beat it, join it.
[2:54:27.620 --> 2:54:31.500]  And so Google was set up 18, 19 years ago, this was, I knew about this before it was
[2:54:31.500 --> 2:54:35.300]  declassified, I'm just saying I have good sources, that they wanted to build a giant
[2:54:35.300 --> 2:54:41.060]  artificial system, and Google believes that the first artificial intelligence will be a
[2:54:41.060 --> 2:54:47.580]  supercomputer based on the neuron activities of the hive mind of humanity with billions
[2:54:47.580 --> 2:54:50.300]  of people wired into it with the Internet of S***.
[2:54:50.300 --> 2:54:53.860]  And so all of our thoughts go into it, and we're actually building a computer that has
[2:54:53.860 --> 2:54:59.860]  real neurons in real time, that's also psychically connected to us that are organic creatures
[2:54:59.860 --> 2:55:05.740]  so that they will have current prediction powers, future prediction powers, a true crystal
[2:55:05.740 --> 2:55:06.740]  ball.
[2:55:06.740 --> 2:55:11.740]  But the big secret is, once you have a crystal ball and know the future, you can add stimuli
[2:55:11.740 --> 2:55:15.260]  beforehand and make decisions that control the future.
[2:55:15.260 --> 2:55:19.860]  And so then it's the end of consciousness and free will for individuals as we know,
[2:55:19.860 --> 2:55:26.180]  and a true 2.0 in a very bad way, hive mind consciousness with an AI jacked into everyone
[2:55:26.180 --> 2:55:31.380]  knowing our hopes and dreams, delivering it to us not in some PKD wire head system where
[2:55:31.380 --> 2:55:34.900]  we plug in and give up on consciousness because of unlimited pleasure, but because we were
[2:55:34.900 --> 2:55:39.340]  already wired in and absorbed before we knew it by giving over our consciousness to this
[2:55:39.340 --> 2:55:43.460]  system by our daily decisions that it was able to manipulate and control into a larger
[2:55:43.460 --> 2:55:44.460]  system.
[2:55:44.460 --> 2:55:53.500]  Is this like a collective AI in the Google search, Google search, where we're also plugged
[2:55:53.500 --> 2:55:54.500]  in.
[2:55:54.500 --> 2:56:00.500]  And so, as it banned on video 2020ElectionCenter.com, very, very important dealing with the facts
[2:56:00.500 --> 2:56:06.380]  will be right back to plumb the depths of the satanic ritual that is Black Lives Matter,
[2:56:06.380 --> 2:56:12.260]  stay with us.
[2:56:12.260 --> 2:56:15.820]  Remember 15 days to flatten the curve because the hospitals were so full, of course, all
[2:56:15.820 --> 2:56:17.660]  that was a lie, all that was a fraud.
[2:56:17.660 --> 2:56:20.860]  The Rockefeller and Bill Gates documents from the beginning on record, they said the mask
[2:56:20.860 --> 2:56:25.420]  wearing will never end, the social distancing will never end, the forced inoculations will
[2:56:25.420 --> 2:56:30.140]  never end, the social tracking through your cell phones and the global social credit score
[2:56:30.140 --> 2:56:31.140]  will never end.
[2:56:31.140 --> 2:56:34.820]  If you put up with it, this is the rollout of the post-human world.
[2:56:34.820 --> 2:56:40.380]  I know you know that, but I've seen national Democrat Party statements that I've seen CNN
[2:56:40.380 --> 2:56:44.780]  and others point out that Jones says that COVID is a hoax, what I'm saying is it's an
[2:56:44.780 --> 2:56:49.420]  overblown fraud, it's a scam, but he sells info wars.com masks.
[2:56:49.420 --> 2:56:53.300]  Yes, if you're going to be made to do it to fly on an airport, or by the police on a
[2:56:53.300 --> 2:56:58.300]  train, then fight back with information warfare, have a walking billboard, that like that's
[2:56:58.300 --> 2:57:02.180]  hypocrisy to be able to hold two different ideas in your head at the same time.
[2:57:02.180 --> 2:57:05.900]  If you're going to be raped by these people, they're going to put the burqa over your head,
[2:57:05.900 --> 2:57:09.100]  might as well advertise it with infowars.com.
[2:57:09.100 --> 2:57:25.140]  It's that simple, ladies and gentlemen, fight back.
[2:57:25.140 --> 2:57:41.660]  Well, Bishop Larry Gators, back with Black Lives Matter, got set up years ago, said
[2:57:41.660 --> 2:57:46.300]  they are Marxist communists, but they're really witches.
[2:57:46.300 --> 2:57:49.100]  And you know, I knew the guy was credible, I knew a little bit of that, but man, he wrote
[2:57:49.100 --> 2:57:53.220]  a bunch about it, I read about it, and all of a sudden they just emerged.
[2:57:53.220 --> 2:57:58.020]  They dressed up like Lucifer, black wings, and they talk about incantations of murder
[2:57:58.020 --> 2:58:01.700]  and the death of police gives them power.
[2:58:01.700 --> 2:58:06.140]  And this demonic spirit with their murdering innocent people, they get all excited, and
[2:58:06.140 --> 2:58:10.340]  then their sacrament is getting rid of the black family or any other family, and going
[2:58:10.340 --> 2:58:11.700]  after the testicles of men.
[2:58:11.700 --> 2:58:18.340]  I mean, this is total Satanism, the end of our species, kill, steal, and destroy.
[2:58:18.340 --> 2:58:24.660]  And they are openly doing these rituals that they believe will have power over all of us.
[2:58:24.660 --> 2:58:31.820]  So Bishop Larry Gators at Bishop L. Gators on Twitter, he laid all this out years ago,
[2:58:31.820 --> 2:58:37.340]  came on the show, he's co-hosted the last six months, but I saw this breaking big today.
[2:58:37.340 --> 2:58:41.180]  There's an article on infowars.com, shocked video, Black Lives Matter founder takes part
[2:58:41.180 --> 2:58:42.180]  in this article.
[2:58:42.180 --> 2:58:48.180]  Remember, V.I. Lennon was a devil worshipper, Stalin was a devil worshipper, Hitler was
[2:58:48.180 --> 2:58:51.020]  a devil worshipper, Mao Zedong, they're not atheists.
[2:58:51.020 --> 2:58:55.460]  They want you to not believe there's a God, so you're hopeless.
[2:58:55.460 --> 2:59:00.540]  But Hollywood and all of it is in the pedophilia to destroy the innocence of children, sex
[2:59:00.540 --> 2:59:04.180]  they can get away with, killing them, they can't, but now they're doing it.
[2:59:04.180 --> 2:59:08.580]  So I wanted to play you because when I was reading what he put out years ago when I
[2:59:08.580 --> 2:59:13.700]  went, I saw him saying this, I went and looked up their current ritual about when police
[2:59:13.700 --> 2:59:18.020]  are murdered, if a police officer is a warrior, they could be black, they could be white,
[2:59:18.020 --> 2:59:20.300]  they could be male, female, particularly a male though.
[2:59:20.300 --> 2:59:24.740]  This is in Germanic rituals, this is in African rituals, this is in ancient Asian rituals
[2:59:24.740 --> 2:59:26.460]  and Mesoamerican rituals.
[2:59:26.460 --> 2:59:31.820]  The highest thing was not a virgin, a child, the highest thing you could kill was not even
[2:59:31.820 --> 2:59:32.820]  a nobleman.
[2:59:32.820 --> 2:59:36.980]  The Druids would demand that, the Aztecs would demand that, it's all the same satanic spirit.
[2:59:36.980 --> 2:59:39.340]  We've never met each other, they're doing the same thing.
[2:59:39.340 --> 2:59:44.660]  What these winged serpents, they called them, demanded in Egypt and in Latin America, which
[2:59:44.660 --> 2:59:51.460]  was before that Mesoamerica and in Europe, was winged serpents would demand that the
[2:59:51.460 --> 2:59:56.220]  pure warrior, the best warrior they had be sacrificed, and that was the spirit trying
[2:59:56.220 --> 3:00:01.460]  to kill the best of humanity, to cull off males that had understanding and connection
[3:00:01.460 --> 3:00:06.540]  to God and had the blueprint and the vision for the species and had the connection to
[3:00:06.540 --> 3:00:11.660]  God's plan to wipe them out and so that's why they make movies back in the early 1970s
[3:00:11.660 --> 3:00:16.300]  like Wicker Man, where they tricked the police officer, who's a good man, a virtuous man
[3:00:16.300 --> 3:00:20.460]  to come to this little island in Scotland, which this stuff really goes on by the way,
[3:00:20.460 --> 3:00:24.460]  to then finally he believes he's saving a little girl, he's not, they sacrifice him
[3:00:24.460 --> 3:00:26.380]  because that's the highest level sacrifice.
[3:00:26.380 --> 3:00:31.100]  This morning I was reading what they did in this ritual about killing the male police
[3:00:31.100 --> 3:00:36.180]  officer who's innocent and means well is the highest level sacrifice.
[3:00:36.180 --> 3:00:39.620]  These will break down his view on this, this is just my own research, seeing this pattern
[3:00:39.620 --> 3:00:43.720]  over and over again, and he's an expert on how they have this cult that feeds on the
[3:00:43.720 --> 3:00:48.460]  energy of black people, which is true, I've run into it, like I'd go protest at abortion
[3:00:48.460 --> 3:00:52.700]  clinics and be black people showed up going, you're not going to stop us getting it.
[3:00:52.700 --> 3:00:56.420]  And so there's this obsession with the energy of black people and black people and in these
[3:00:56.420 --> 3:01:00.020]  say, the Satanists who are white as well, and so they're the ones saying they're protecting
[3:01:00.020 --> 3:01:02.380]  black people when they're obsessed with the energy.
[3:01:02.380 --> 3:01:06.300]  So he'll give you his view on it, I understand a lot of his perspective, but I've got my
[3:01:06.300 --> 3:01:09.740]  own just my own research, but it's all dead on.
[3:01:09.740 --> 3:01:15.860]  So here is the trailer for the 1973 film Wicker Man, which is based on real rituals of killing
[3:01:15.860 --> 3:01:19.620]  the pure warrior.
[3:01:19.620 --> 3:01:43.620]  I could a tale unfold whose lightest word would hero up my soul, priest, a young blood.
[3:01:43.620 --> 3:01:55.500]  I am here to investigate the disappearance of a young girl.
[3:01:55.500 --> 3:01:57.260]  Where is Rowan Morrison?
[3:01:57.260 --> 3:02:00.220]  If Rowan Morrison existed, we would know.
[3:02:00.220 --> 3:02:01.220]  I suspect Madden.
[3:02:01.220 --> 3:02:02.220]  I can see that you've already...
[3:02:02.220 --> 3:02:08.180]  In the name of God, woman, what kind of mother are you that can stand by and see your own
[3:02:08.180 --> 3:02:13.060]  child slaughtered?
[3:02:13.060 --> 3:02:16.060]  You are the fool, Mr. Howard.
[3:02:16.060 --> 3:02:45.340]  You liars, you are despicable little liars.
[3:02:45.340 --> 3:02:52.340]  You are the fool, Mr. Howard.
[3:02:52.340 --> 3:03:02.340]  Where is Rowan Morrison?
[3:03:02.340 --> 3:03:05.340]  If Rowan Morrison existed, we would know.
[3:03:05.340 --> 3:03:06.340]  I suspect Madden.
[3:03:06.340 --> 3:03:07.340]  She was...
[3:03:07.340 --> 3:03:11.340]  You are the fool, Mr. Howard.
[3:03:11.340 --> 3:03:13.340]  Where is Rowan Morrison?
[3:03:13.340 --> 3:03:16.340]  Oh, my God!
[3:03:16.340 --> 3:03:19.340]  So, he thought he was going to save a little girl.
[3:03:19.340 --> 3:03:21.340]  No, they were coming to kill him.
[3:03:21.340 --> 3:03:27.340]  Bishop Larry Gators is our guest he takes over right now, but I thought of this because
[3:03:27.340 --> 3:03:33.060]  in the ritual, she says she's raising up her incarnated brother, but really her ritual
[3:03:33.060 --> 3:03:38.660]  is killing the black male and the male period, and they admit that is their ritual.
[3:03:38.660 --> 3:03:41.260]  But now she's claiming she's killed the male.
[3:03:41.260 --> 3:03:43.980]  Now she's rising the male or ushering in the Antichrist.
[3:03:43.980 --> 3:03:47.260]  Premier Deep Research, is that an accurate analysis?
[3:03:47.260 --> 3:03:49.580]  You are 100% right, Alex.
[3:03:49.580 --> 3:03:54.700]  Thank you so much for giving the bishop an opportunity to come back to grace your powerful
[3:03:54.700 --> 3:03:55.700]  program.
[3:03:55.700 --> 3:04:01.540]  Now, thank God for you, Alex, because you are indeed my mentor.
[3:04:01.540 --> 3:04:02.540]  Yes.
[3:04:02.540 --> 3:04:08.540]  So, then, Black Lives Matter is a three-fold paradigm, the manipulation of reality, the
[3:04:08.540 --> 3:04:13.460]  manipulation of time through the prism of the manipulation of probability.
[3:04:13.460 --> 3:04:16.540]  Now, that's portrays colors, okay?
[3:04:16.540 --> 3:04:20.900]  And I'm going to get out and look at the floor, but you said it would really be a black magic
[3:04:20.900 --> 3:04:24.780]  ritual that they would soon reveal themselves and then be destroyed, and then they're now
[3:04:24.780 --> 3:04:25.780]  doing it.
[3:04:25.780 --> 3:04:33.100]  Yeah, because their foundation is this West African witchcraft religion called Odu Aipa,
[3:04:33.100 --> 3:04:40.140]  which represents the 16 points of demonic possession and infiltration of the human body.
[3:04:40.140 --> 3:04:45.780]  But yet, at the same time, Alex, there are 16 Black Lives Matter chapters here in the
[3:04:45.780 --> 3:04:47.660]  United States and in Canada.
[3:04:47.660 --> 3:04:49.500]  That is not by accident.
[3:04:49.500 --> 3:04:54.660]  So these three women, okay, we're talking about portrays colors.
[3:04:54.660 --> 3:04:57.780]  Well, they now admit, they say the whole thing is a ritual.
[3:04:57.780 --> 3:05:00.980]  Yeah, the whole thing is a ritual, including Alicia Garza.
[3:05:00.980 --> 3:05:02.100]  It's a ritual.
[3:05:02.100 --> 3:05:04.980]  These are witches, men of God.
[3:05:04.980 --> 3:05:08.580]  These are witches, and these women must be destroyed.
[3:05:08.580 --> 3:05:15.220]  What Black Lives Matter has been designed is to put multiple curses and hexes upon these
[3:05:15.220 --> 3:05:20.420]  United States of America, because they're being used by the Club of Alphabet, Lucifer,
[3:05:20.420 --> 3:05:21.420]  and Deep State.
[3:05:21.420 --> 3:05:26.820]  So yes, that is a satanic ritual that you look at that right now, my friend, on food
[3:05:26.820 --> 3:05:28.340]  portrays colors.
[3:05:28.340 --> 3:05:29.340]  These are witches.
[3:05:29.340 --> 3:05:34.020]  They're not witches because they're Black women, and they're not witches because they're
[3:05:34.020 --> 3:05:35.020]  women.
[3:05:35.020 --> 3:05:40.780]  They're witches because they're operating, Brother Alex, under a spirit that is not from
[3:05:40.780 --> 3:05:47.540]  God, from the Odu, Aipha, demonic religion, which is a witchcraft religion through libation.
[3:05:47.540 --> 3:05:51.220]  But let's be clear, as I said earlier, you elaborate on this, it's the same thing the
[3:05:51.220 --> 3:05:56.740]  ancient druidics did, that the Mesoamericans did, that the Africans, every group's doing
[3:05:56.740 --> 3:05:57.740]  the same thing.
[3:05:57.740 --> 3:05:58.740]  That means it's a spirit.
[3:05:58.740 --> 3:06:04.260]  See, you and I are not fighting against flesh and blood, but against principality and power.
[3:06:04.260 --> 3:06:11.540]  So then our enemy is not the physicality of Black Lives Matter, it is the demonic realm
[3:06:11.540 --> 3:06:19.260]  that goes back to Genesis 6, Enoch 6, and Jude 6, 666, historical or social distancing.
[3:06:19.260 --> 3:06:26.140]  These are demons of men of God that you and I are encountering, but President Trump is
[3:06:26.140 --> 3:06:29.540]  going to destroy Black Lives Matter in the next year or two.
[3:06:29.540 --> 3:06:30.540]  I guarantee you.
[3:06:30.540 --> 3:06:32.020]  All right, brother, you've got the floor.
[3:06:32.020 --> 3:06:34.020]  We really appreciate you joining us.
[3:06:34.020 --> 3:06:37.500]  We appreciate Dr. Sherry Tenpenny, Bishop Larry Gators.
[3:06:37.500 --> 3:06:39.620]  I gave out your Twitter, Bishop L. Gators.
[3:06:39.620 --> 3:06:41.460]  Where else can people find your great work?
[3:06:41.460 --> 3:06:49.180]  Yeah, they can also go to facebook.com for us, Bishop L. Gators, that's G-A-I-T-E-R-S.
[3:06:49.180 --> 3:06:53.660]  Also we are nationally syndicated, internationally syndicated through the Life Radio Network,
[3:06:53.660 --> 3:06:57.860]  the 22.9 FM, 1468, here on Life Radio, you're on thousands of stations.
[3:06:57.860 --> 3:06:59.260]  All right, you're going to take over.
[3:06:59.260 --> 3:07:01.260]  I'll be listening while I get my work done.
[3:07:01.260 --> 3:07:02.260]  We love you.
[3:07:02.260 --> 3:07:03.260]  We appreciate you.
[3:07:03.260 --> 3:07:04.260]  My God, they're all out in the open.
[3:07:04.260 --> 3:07:06.580]  I knew they were into the occult, but now they admit the whole thing's an occult ritual
[3:07:06.580 --> 3:07:07.580]  to bring down America.
[3:07:07.580 --> 3:07:11.080]  We'll be right back.
[3:07:11.080 --> 3:07:13.660]  The party was not going to go on forever.
[3:07:13.660 --> 3:07:18.940]  All the welfare, all the entertainment, all the decadence was only designed to get people
[3:07:18.940 --> 3:07:25.180]  domesticated, dumbed down, selfish, and, most importantly, isolated.
[3:07:25.180 --> 3:07:30.860]  And now that most of the population is selfish, isolated, and very, very dumbed down and ignorant,
[3:07:30.860 --> 3:07:33.900]  the New World Order is taking its move.
[3:07:33.900 --> 3:07:38.940]  And they are now going to weaponize the giant masses of foolish followers who believe they
[3:07:38.940 --> 3:07:39.940]  just follow orders.
[3:07:39.940 --> 3:07:44.220]  They'll get another little piece of green like when the chicken pecks at the lever.
[3:07:44.220 --> 3:07:48.580]  And all that they're really going to get is the noose typed around their foolish neck.
[3:07:48.580 --> 3:07:53.420]  Those of us that are aware and informed can laugh at the mass of slaves, but remember,
[3:07:53.420 --> 3:07:58.100]  they're a dangerous weapon appointed at our throats, and so we've got to save them to
[3:07:58.100 --> 3:07:59.100]  save ourselves.
[3:07:59.100 --> 3:08:01.100]  And to do that, we've got to expose the globalists.
[3:08:01.100 --> 3:08:05.980]  We've got to take it to them politically and absolutely annihilate them with the crimes
[3:08:05.980 --> 3:08:07.580]  that they've actually committed.
[3:08:07.580 --> 3:08:08.580]  Expose the enemy now.
[3:08:08.580 --> 3:08:13.580]  This is going to come down to fight over how many people are awake and how many aren't.
[3:08:13.580 --> 3:08:14.580]  They're going to contest an election.
[3:08:14.580 --> 3:08:15.580]  They're going to say Trump lost.
[3:08:15.580 --> 3:08:17.580]  They're super pissed that I'm on air.
[3:08:17.580 --> 3:08:18.580]  They shut down.
[3:08:18.580 --> 3:08:19.580]  I want them silenced.
[3:08:19.580 --> 3:08:20.580]  I want them muted.
[3:08:20.580 --> 3:08:21.580]  I think they are horrible for our society.
[3:08:21.580 --> 3:08:22.580]  You kept us on air.
[3:08:22.580 --> 3:08:23.580]  We did the analysis first.
[3:08:23.580 --> 3:08:24.580]  It's now gone mainstream.
[3:08:24.580 --> 3:08:27.580]  We continue to be the epicenter.
[3:08:27.580 --> 3:08:32.580]  And what they've said directly to us is you continue to be the epicenter of our plans
[3:08:32.580 --> 3:08:33.580]  not going the way we want.
[3:08:33.580 --> 3:08:35.580]  And you need to stop right now.
[3:08:35.580 --> 3:08:36.580]  And they're very, very serious.
[3:08:36.580 --> 3:08:38.580]  Well, I'm not signing on with a bunch of devil worshiping child molesters.
[3:08:38.580 --> 3:08:39.580]  This is not going to happen.
[3:08:39.580 --> 3:08:41.580]  So they are moving now to destroy them.
[3:08:41.580 --> 3:08:43.580]  I used to say support them for us.
[3:08:43.580 --> 3:08:44.580]  Rescue them for us.
[3:08:44.580 --> 3:08:45.580]  Save yourself.
[3:08:45.580 --> 3:08:46.580]  Save the world.
[3:08:46.580 --> 3:08:47.580]  We're in this together.
[3:08:47.580 --> 3:08:49.580]  Because let me tell you something.
[3:08:49.580 --> 3:08:50.580]  Communism's up here.
[3:08:50.580 --> 3:08:53.580]  Info Wars is the dam blocking it, which is all of us together supporting.
[3:08:53.580 --> 3:08:55.580]  And you and I are all down here with our families.
[3:08:55.580 --> 3:08:57.580]  My children are right here.
[3:08:57.580 --> 3:08:59.580]  But I need money to fight a war.
[3:08:59.580 --> 3:09:01.580]  And I need word of mouth.
[3:09:01.580 --> 3:09:02.580]  And I need prayer.
[3:09:02.580 --> 3:09:03.580]  And I need action.
[3:09:03.580 --> 3:09:05.580]  Because that dam's going to come down.
[3:09:05.580 --> 3:09:20.580]  Crops told you hell's coming.
[3:09:36.580 --> 3:09:43.580]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones show here with your guest host during the fourth hour
[3:09:43.580 --> 3:09:49.580]  of the most powerful radio and television show in America today, the Alex Jones show.
[3:09:49.580 --> 3:09:52.580]  This is your host and moderator, Bishop Larry Gators.
[3:09:52.580 --> 3:09:56.580]  I am the host of the nationally internationally syndicated radio broadcast global spiritual
[3:09:56.580 --> 3:09:59.580]  revolution radio on the live radio network.
[3:09:59.580 --> 3:10:07.580]  92.9 FM 1460 AM on your down were also internationally syndicated through both the I heart radio
[3:10:07.580 --> 3:10:11.580]  network in the I heart media group here in New York City to New York.
[3:10:11.580 --> 3:10:18.580]  I'm so very excited to be back during the fourth hour of the most powerful show on the
[3:10:18.580 --> 3:10:23.580]  earth today, the Alex Jones show to talk about what we you and I talked about a few weeks
[3:10:23.580 --> 3:10:28.580]  ago concerning the coming destruction of black lives matter.
[3:10:28.580 --> 3:10:31.580]  Black lives matter is a trauma based organization.
[3:10:31.580 --> 3:10:34.580]  Now, one may say, Bishop, what do you mean?
[3:10:34.580 --> 3:10:41.580]  Well, every black organization in American history was not only not founded by black
[3:10:41.580 --> 3:10:49.580]  people, but every black organization in America is based on trauma and victimhood.
[3:10:49.580 --> 3:10:57.580]  So there is a three fold tier fold of manipulation that is the foundation of black lives matter
[3:10:57.580 --> 3:10:59.580]  in their coming destruction.
[3:10:59.580 --> 3:11:07.580]  And that is the manipulation of reality that we call SO kinesis the manipulation of time
[3:11:07.580 --> 3:11:15.580]  chrono kinesis through the prism of the manipulation of probability tackle kinesis.
[3:11:15.580 --> 3:11:21.580]  That's ECT, which is the acronym for the French word, et cetera, et cetera.
[3:11:21.580 --> 3:11:27.580]  And that goes back thousands of years to Eastern, Central and Western Europe, which is and war
[3:11:27.580 --> 3:11:35.580]  launched through many wicked demonic sicker societies would put hexes upon people in the
[3:11:35.580 --> 3:11:39.580]  form of this ECT or et cetera.
[3:11:39.580 --> 3:11:47.580]  So to understand black lives matter, you have to examine it from a spiritual paradigm.
[3:11:47.580 --> 3:11:59.580]  So black America, our historical pain is being manipulated and our present day trauma is being
[3:11:59.580 --> 3:12:00.580]  weaponized.
[3:12:00.580 --> 3:12:02.580]  Let me say this again.
[3:12:02.580 --> 3:12:12.580]  So both the pain of black America is being manipulated and our historical trauma is being
[3:12:12.580 --> 3:12:17.580]  weaponized against us in order for us to destroy us.
[3:12:17.580 --> 3:12:23.580]  So then when we're talking about the coming destruction of black lives matter, not just
[3:12:23.580 --> 3:12:30.580]  through the manipulation of reality, time improbability, but also there is the manipulation
[3:12:30.580 --> 3:12:36.580]  of what you and I call perceived reality and perceived control.
[3:12:36.580 --> 3:12:46.580]  So then when you have to look at the psychology of black America in order for you and I to
[3:12:46.580 --> 3:12:52.580]  properly understand who and what black lives matter is concerning the coming destruction
[3:12:52.580 --> 3:12:54.580]  of black lives matter.
[3:12:54.580 --> 3:13:02.580]  So if you have terms like neuroplasticity, which means the brain grows in forms to become
[3:13:02.580 --> 3:13:06.580]  the very shape of what the individual is thinking at that moment.
[3:13:06.580 --> 3:13:10.580]  Then you have neuro-parasitology.
[3:13:10.580 --> 3:13:16.580]  That is a psychological disorder because of bad dieting, not just with black people, but
[3:13:16.580 --> 3:13:18.580]  most Americans.
[3:13:18.580 --> 3:13:26.580]  The bad dieting, the food that you and I ingest because of self-hatred, mainly with black
[3:13:26.580 --> 3:13:36.580]  lives matter, it creates a parasitical scion, which the food becomes parasitic and thereby
[3:13:36.580 --> 3:13:41.580]  overtakes both our brains and our blood supply.
[3:13:41.580 --> 3:13:43.580]  That's neuro-parasitology.
[3:13:43.580 --> 3:13:49.580]  Then you have hyper-coagulation or coagulability.
[3:13:49.580 --> 3:13:59.580]  It means that the blood supply and your blood system becomes coagulated because of both
[3:13:59.580 --> 3:14:04.580]  neuro-parasitology and neuroplasticity.
[3:14:04.580 --> 3:14:12.580]  This is the case with black lives matter because black lives matter represents the black
[3:14:12.580 --> 3:14:19.580]  skulls and bones being connected to the blue-laced society, which is the black equivalent of
[3:14:19.580 --> 3:14:21.580]  Yale University skulls and bones.
[3:14:21.580 --> 3:14:28.580]  So then as we're talking about the coming destruction of black lives matter, now,
[3:14:28.580 --> 3:14:33.580]  Brother Alex powerfully articulated concerning fallen angels.
[3:14:33.580 --> 3:14:42.580]  Now, you and I are taught and commanded by the global balthamate Lucifer and Deep State to separate
[3:14:42.580 --> 3:14:45.580]  six feet from each other in diameter.
[3:14:45.580 --> 3:14:59.580]  Well, 7.7 billion people or corps or corporations times six feet of separation equals 46 billion
[3:14:59.580 --> 3:15:03.580]  200 million degrees of separation.
[3:15:03.580 --> 3:15:05.580]  Well, look at the number 46.
[3:15:05.580 --> 3:15:10.580]  You and I had 46 chromosomes, 23 from the mother, 23 from the father.
[3:15:10.580 --> 3:15:11.580]  Okay.
[3:15:11.580 --> 3:15:18.580]  In Genesis, chapter three, verses one, dropping down to verses four and five, according to
[3:15:18.580 --> 3:15:28.580]  the King James version, the serpent spoke 46 words to the woman, okay, who was later
[3:15:28.580 --> 3:15:29.580]  named Eve.
[3:15:29.580 --> 3:15:32.580]  Her husband is Adam.
[3:15:32.580 --> 3:15:35.580]  The first and last letters of the name Adam is AM.
[3:15:35.580 --> 3:15:38.580]  So Adam was created as the AM of the morning.
[3:15:38.580 --> 3:15:45.580]  And his wife Eve was designed by God to be the PM of the evening.
[3:15:45.580 --> 3:15:54.580]  So is Adam and Eve and not Adam and Deacon Stevie is Eve and Adam and not Eve and Ellen degenerate.
[3:15:54.580 --> 3:15:56.580]  Another topic for another day.
[3:15:56.580 --> 3:16:06.580]  So 7.7 billion people times six feet in separation, social distancing, which also means the Gestalt
[3:16:06.580 --> 3:16:07.580]  Fairy.
[3:16:07.580 --> 3:16:14.580]  That's 46 billion 200 million degrees of separation, 46 chromosomes.
[3:16:14.580 --> 3:16:21.580]  Now you and I did not have any chromosomes prior to Genesis three because you and I were
[3:16:21.580 --> 3:16:27.580]  designed to be a trichotomy spirit soul living inside of a body.
[3:16:27.580 --> 3:16:35.580]  So we had no need of a chromosome after the serpent came in contact with the woman Eve.
[3:16:35.580 --> 3:16:41.580]  Then we acquired or attain 46 chromosomes.
[3:16:41.580 --> 3:16:50.580]  Now you have the number 200 million in the books of Genesis chapter six, more specifically
[3:16:50.580 --> 3:16:59.580]  Enoch six and Jews six, six, six, six, historical, social, tracing and distancing.
[3:16:59.580 --> 3:17:12.580]  There were 200 angels on Mount Hermon in Enoch six, 20 of which are named by Enoch in Enoch
[3:17:12.580 --> 3:17:19.580]  six that I'm going to reveal during the second segment here on the Alex Jones show with your
[3:17:19.580 --> 3:17:22.580]  guest moderator and teacher today Bishop liricators.
[3:17:22.580 --> 3:17:30.580]  As we are rediscussing and pound three articulated to you are Patriots, the coming destruction
[3:17:30.580 --> 3:17:32.580]  of black lives matter.
[3:17:32.580 --> 3:17:36.580]  7.7 billion people times six feet in circumference.
[3:17:36.580 --> 3:17:41.580]  That's 46 billion 200 million degrees of separation.
[3:17:41.580 --> 3:17:47.580]  We will see you here in about two to three minutes time here on the Alex Jones show with
[3:17:47.580 --> 3:18:06.580]  your guest host Bishop liricators.
[3:18:06.580 --> 3:18:11.580]  It sounds over the top when I go on air and I explained that the controllers of the planet
[3:18:11.580 --> 3:18:17.580]  want to carry out the extermination of the entire human population except for a few of
[3:18:17.580 --> 3:18:20.580]  what they call their new transcended silicon gods.
[3:18:20.580 --> 3:18:22.580]  But that's really what they're now externalizing.
[3:18:22.580 --> 3:18:27.580]  They're now taking what was in their textbooks and white papers 30 years ago and actually
[3:18:27.580 --> 3:18:29.580]  openly announcing it everywhere.
[3:18:29.580 --> 3:18:33.580]  They're going from beta to operational and think about all these major corporations.
[3:18:33.580 --> 3:18:34.580]  They tell you humans are horrible.
[3:18:34.580 --> 3:18:36.580]  They tell you humans are a parasite.
[3:18:36.580 --> 3:18:40.580]  They tell that we've all got to be gotten rid of and then they won't let people see their
[3:18:40.580 --> 3:18:43.580]  books and nursing homes and then ship in COVID to kill them.
[3:18:43.580 --> 3:18:49.580]  That's all organizing as a beta test for larger operations and everything is a microcosm and
[3:18:49.580 --> 3:18:54.580]  a laboratory test of larger scalability of what they are now beginning to roll out.
[3:18:54.580 --> 3:18:58.580]  Look at how they're banning medical doctors from promoting therapeutics.
[3:18:58.580 --> 3:19:01.580]  They're absolutely essential to stop viral infections like COVID-19.
[3:19:01.580 --> 3:19:04.580]  This is all absolute information control.
[3:19:04.580 --> 3:19:06.580]  This is beyond 1984.
[3:19:06.580 --> 3:19:10.580]  Dependency, domestication.
[3:19:10.580 --> 3:19:14.580]  In the real world, ignorance is not bliss.
[3:19:14.580 --> 3:19:16.580]  It's enslavement and it's death.
[3:19:16.580 --> 3:19:20.580]  The globalists are teaching us all that we're non-essential.
[3:19:20.580 --> 3:19:24.580]  With automation, they're bringing in a world that doesn't power humanity but makes us obsolete.
[3:19:24.580 --> 3:19:25.580]  But we're not obsolete.
[3:19:25.580 --> 3:19:27.580]  We don't have to listen to them.
[3:19:27.580 --> 3:19:28.580]  We can farm again.
[3:19:28.580 --> 3:19:29.580]  We can garden.
[3:19:29.580 --> 3:19:30.580]  We can become self-sufficient.
[3:19:30.580 --> 3:19:35.580]  But first we've got to learn to stand up politically for ourselves and we need to become self-sufficient.
[3:19:35.580 --> 3:19:41.580]  That begins with water filtration to take control of that from the globalists and their fluoride
[3:19:41.580 --> 3:19:44.580]  and their dumbing down agenda and with storeable food.
[3:19:44.580 --> 3:19:50.580]  And we have it all the highest quality, the highest rated at the lowest prices at mforestore.com.
[3:19:50.580 --> 3:19:51.580]  Take action now.
[3:19:51.580 --> 3:19:54.580]  You cannot lose unless you do not take action.
[3:19:54.580 --> 3:19:59.580]  We have the best water filtration, the best storeable food, and it funds the infowar.
[3:19:59.580 --> 3:20:01.580]  Take action now while you still can.
[3:20:01.580 --> 3:20:02.580]  Become prepared.
[3:20:02.580 --> 3:20:03.580]  Become self-sufficient now.
[3:20:03.580 --> 3:20:05.580]  At mforestore.com.
[3:20:33.580 --> 3:20:38.580]  It's very open about what they're doing and they count on us just being very passive living
[3:20:38.580 --> 3:20:42.580]  in the matrix-like system that they're building.
[3:20:42.580 --> 3:20:47.580]  But what defines humans more than anything from the rest of the quote animal kingdom is
[3:20:47.580 --> 3:20:49.580]  that we control our environment.
[3:20:49.580 --> 3:20:51.580]  We build our own environments.
[3:20:51.580 --> 3:20:53.580]  We create our own systems.
[3:20:53.580 --> 3:20:59.580]  We really geo-engineer and terraform the planet and its systems towards our aims.
[3:20:59.580 --> 3:21:04.580]  But instead we're acting like animals while the globalists play the part of humans and us as cattle.
[3:21:04.580 --> 3:21:31.580]  That's the trick.
[3:21:31.580 --> 3:21:35.580]  Welcome back to America's number one show, The Alex Jones Show.
[3:21:35.580 --> 3:21:43.580]  Here with your host and moderator and teacher and guest host during the last hour of The Alex Jones Show on Infowars.
[3:21:43.580 --> 3:21:45.580]  Please support Infowars.
[3:21:45.580 --> 3:21:53.580]  I guarantee you you will get a great return of truth and authenticity here in the 21st century.
[3:21:53.580 --> 3:21:55.580]  The coming destruction of Black Lives Matter.
[3:21:55.580 --> 3:22:01.580]  So 7.7 billion people times six feet of separation.
[3:22:01.580 --> 3:22:12.580]  And by the way, as a side note, which is in warlock, going back thousands of years, in order through their seances to invoke demons through incantations,
[3:22:12.580 --> 3:22:23.580]  every witch, every warlock, every sacredness, every wicked participant must be separated six feet in circumference.
[3:22:23.580 --> 3:22:29.580]  7.7 billion people times six feet in circumference is 46 billion.
[3:22:29.580 --> 3:22:35.580]  You and I have 46 chromosomes, 200 million degrees of separation.
[3:22:35.580 --> 3:22:54.580]  Now in Enoch chapter 6, it gives a catalog of 200 angels, okay, which are not just in Genesis 6, Enoch 6, Jude 6, 666, historical, spiritual, social distancing.
[3:22:54.580 --> 3:23:10.580]  But in Enoch 6, it reveals 20 fallen angels, which reveal through dark articulation, a demonic code of not only to destroy humanity,
[3:23:10.580 --> 3:23:14.580]  but I believe the future United States of America, which is today.
[3:23:14.580 --> 3:23:19.580]  Here are the names of those 20 fallen angels in Enoch chapter 6.
[3:23:19.580 --> 3:23:24.580]  Syme Giza, his name means cognition.
[3:23:24.580 --> 3:23:27.580]  Syme Ziah means thinking.
[3:23:27.580 --> 3:23:30.580]  Erichaba means that will.
[3:23:30.580 --> 3:23:32.580]  Remille means to begin.
[3:23:32.580 --> 3:23:35.580]  Cochabiel means the process.
[3:23:35.580 --> 3:23:38.580]  Tamiel means of reversing.
[3:23:38.580 --> 3:23:40.580]  Remille means the design.
[3:23:40.580 --> 3:23:43.580]  Daniel means from God.
[3:23:43.580 --> 3:23:47.580]  Ezekiel with the Q means to re-order.
[3:23:47.580 --> 3:23:50.580]  Cerequil means a new design.
[3:23:50.580 --> 3:23:54.580]  Azale means a pathogen.
[3:23:54.580 --> 3:23:57.580]  Aramos means a new protein.
[3:23:57.580 --> 3:24:00.580]  Beterial means a beginning.
[3:24:00.580 --> 3:24:04.580]  Ananil means kingdom.
[3:24:04.580 --> 3:24:08.580]  Zaquiel with the Z and the Q means a new government.
[3:24:08.580 --> 3:24:14.580]  Sands of Peel means back to heaven.
[3:24:14.580 --> 3:24:17.580]  Cerequil means to rule.
[3:24:17.580 --> 3:24:19.580]  Turial means humanity.
[3:24:19.580 --> 3:24:23.580]  John Jail means to resent DNA.
[3:24:23.580 --> 3:24:26.580]  And Cereo means deception.
[3:24:26.580 --> 3:24:35.580]  So in Enoch chapter 6, in connection to these witches of Elisha Garza over to many,
[3:24:35.580 --> 3:24:43.580]  and portrays colors for nothing but modern-day witches, warlocks.
[3:24:43.580 --> 3:24:50.580]  So Enoch chapter 6 actually is being exposed to us by the Holy Ghost.
[3:24:50.580 --> 3:24:59.580]  Cognitional thinking that will begin the process of reversing the design from God
[3:24:59.580 --> 3:25:06.580]  in order to reorder a new design, a new pathogen,
[3:25:06.580 --> 3:25:13.580]  a new protein to begin a new beginning, a new kingdom,
[3:25:13.580 --> 3:25:21.580]  a new government going back to heaven to rule humanity
[3:25:21.580 --> 3:25:28.580]  through resetting DNA giving birth to deception.
[3:25:28.580 --> 3:25:35.580]  That's what genetic engineering is talking about in not just in Genesis 6, Enoch 6,
[3:25:35.580 --> 3:25:37.580]  and Jude 6.
[3:25:37.580 --> 3:25:46.580]  So in Enoch 6, it talks about cognitional thinking that will begin the process of reversing the design from God
[3:25:46.580 --> 3:25:53.580]  to reorder a new design, a new pathogen, a new protein to begin a new beginning,
[3:25:53.580 --> 3:26:00.580]  a new kingdom, a new government going back to heaven to rule humanity
[3:26:00.580 --> 3:26:04.580]  to reset DNA through deception.
[3:26:04.580 --> 3:26:11.580]  That is the premise of the paradigm of Black Lives Matter.
[3:26:11.580 --> 3:26:22.580]  They want to genetically replicate the political DNA in the political RNA of America.
[3:26:22.580 --> 3:26:29.580]  That is 7.7 billion people times 6-3 of separation.
[3:26:29.580 --> 3:26:37.580]  In other words, not only is this, my brothers and sisters, the greatest global cover in human history based on a scale,
[3:26:37.580 --> 3:26:49.580]  but it represents the greatest organized global hexing and cursing project in human history,
[3:26:49.580 --> 3:26:51.580]  but it's not going to work.
[3:26:51.580 --> 3:27:00.580]  So Black Lives Matter, they are all their father, the devil, and the less of their father they were due.
[3:27:00.580 --> 3:27:06.580]  So in other words, to understand 7.7 billion people, man, I love to teach,
[3:27:06.580 --> 3:27:14.580]  on times 6 feet in circumference, that is approximately 46,200,000 degrees of separation.
[3:27:14.580 --> 3:27:21.580]  Look at the NBA, what I call the Nephilim, I'm sorry, National Basketball Association.
[3:27:21.580 --> 3:27:31.580]  The entire American sports industrial complex is being scanned and used not by a Black organization.
[3:27:31.580 --> 3:27:37.580]  No Black organization was ever organically created by Black people.
[3:27:37.580 --> 3:27:45.580]  They were all found up by Caesarean monsters. When you talk about the NAACP,
[3:27:45.580 --> 3:27:52.580]  with Henry Moskowitz out of Romania, and the Spindorm brothers also out of Romania,
[3:27:52.580 --> 3:28:01.580]  they immigrated to the United States from Romania to create the NAACP SNCCOR urban league.
[3:28:01.580 --> 3:28:08.580]  Even the Nation of Islam is built upon a white man from New Zealand.
[3:28:08.580 --> 3:28:18.580]  So then the Nation of Islam in connection to Black Lives Matter, these are fraudulent organizations,
[3:28:18.580 --> 3:28:25.580]  not ordained by God, but ordained by devils like George Soros.
[3:28:25.580 --> 3:28:34.580]  And as a side note, do you know H.L. Hunt, the former white billionaire woman from Texas, the late H.R. Hunt,
[3:28:34.580 --> 3:28:43.580]  he financially not only set up the JFK assassination prior to the 22nd of November 1963,
[3:28:43.580 --> 3:28:54.580]  but the same H.L. Hunt supported Elijah Muhammad in the Nation of Islam $100,000 a year.
[3:28:54.580 --> 3:29:00.580]  But why is it that people think that the Nation of Islam is real?
[3:29:00.580 --> 3:29:07.580]  So the Nation of Islam, Black Lives Matter, the original Black Panther Party,
[3:29:07.580 --> 3:29:15.580]  the present Black Panther Party, they're all organically created, not by Black people,
[3:29:15.580 --> 3:29:19.580]  but by people who don't look like we.
[3:29:19.580 --> 3:29:25.580]  I'm not talking about Canadians, I'm not talking about Jewish people, as we're talking about the common destruction of Black Lives Matter.
[3:29:25.580 --> 3:29:34.580]  In the tale that Brother Alex and I talked about in Revelation chapter 12 verse 4, this is Black Lives Matter.
[3:29:34.580 --> 3:29:47.580]  A third part of the angelic government of God was contaminated by and through the tale of Lucifer.
[3:29:47.580 --> 3:29:53.580]  There's a great length there. So the original Black Panther Party was subsidized by H.R. Hunt,
[3:29:53.580 --> 3:30:00.580]  the Nation of Islam, whose God is a white man from New Zealand, okay?
[3:30:00.580 --> 3:30:10.580]  They were financially subsidized by H.R. Hunt, and the KKK, okay, was also subsidized by H.L. Hunt.
[3:30:10.580 --> 3:30:21.580]  The same liberal devil H.L. Hunt was playing all of these organizations together as a puppet master.
[3:30:21.580 --> 3:30:28.580]  Now the slave master of Black Lives Matter is George Swartz, or Soros.
[3:30:28.580 --> 3:30:36.580]  His real name is Swartz, which is also the last name of Alicia Garza Swartz.
[3:30:36.580 --> 3:30:44.580]  We're going to get deeper into that during the third segment here on The Alex Jones Show with your guest host and moderator and teacher,
[3:30:44.580 --> 3:30:53.580]  Bishop Larry Gators. We see you back here in about two to three minutes time here on America's number one show, The Alex Jones Show.
[3:30:53.580 --> 3:31:06.580]  Music
[3:31:06.580 --> 3:31:12.580]  It couldn't have been scripted any better. That's because it was completely scripted,
[3:31:12.580 --> 3:31:17.580]  and we even know the names of the United Nations Rockefeller Foundation,
[3:31:17.580 --> 3:31:24.580]  as well as the Gates and John Hopkins documents. We have the script, just like you'd have for a Hollywood movie,
[3:31:24.580 --> 3:31:33.580]  and it's designed to freeze civilization and have a post-Renaissance stagnation or new dark age
[3:31:33.580 --> 3:31:39.580]  and a total consolidation of all wealth and power in the hands of the kleptocratic post-humanist.
[3:31:39.580 --> 3:31:45.580]  The magnitude of this is unfathomable. As you can see, all the checkboxes of tyranny are being marked carefully.
[3:31:45.580 --> 3:31:52.580]  Every eye dotted, every T crossed, a total societal vertical integration takeover, medical tyranny, total surveillance.
[3:31:52.580 --> 3:31:56.580]  The big tech heads, on average, have had their wealth cook up 35% in the last eight months.
[3:31:56.580 --> 3:32:03.580]  And of course, Jeff Bezos has basically doubled his. Everyone is being forced onto their system to post-human robot takeover.
[3:32:03.580 --> 3:32:05.580]  You're being made obsolete.
[3:32:05.580 --> 3:32:16.580]  In Germany, in Australia, in Canada, and now even in Ohio, every blue state, every blue city is announcing
[3:32:16.580 --> 3:32:23.580]  that they are establishing emergency COVID centers for people that refuse to be tested or people that are tested
[3:32:23.580 --> 3:32:29.580]  but refuse to stay in place while the results are coming back or those that supposedly break quarantine.
[3:32:29.580 --> 3:32:36.580]  This, of course, is all based on the tests that are over 90% fraudulent and were designed to be so.
[3:32:36.580 --> 3:32:41.580]  This is a power grab. The world government globalist system is in trouble.
[3:32:41.580 --> 3:32:45.580]  All over the planet, free peoples are trying to pull out of it.
[3:32:45.580 --> 3:32:52.580]  And every blue area, I use the term blue as if in the U.S. for blue for Democrats, red for Republicans,
[3:32:52.580 --> 3:32:59.580]  is basically globalist or communist and authoritarian. And they are using this as their cover for an authoritarian takeover
[3:32:59.580 --> 3:33:05.580]  because they know the world's waiting to them. It's a very simple equation. It's illegal. We must resist it.
[3:33:07.580 --> 3:33:10.580]  I don't want to be right about this prediction.
[3:33:10.580 --> 3:33:17.580]  In fact, it's not a prediction. It is a forecast that we continue down the economic road.
[3:33:17.580 --> 3:33:22.580]  We're on globally with the ongoing COVID-19 lockdowns and the structure to productivity.
[3:33:22.580 --> 3:33:26.580]  It will continue to accelerate these ripple effects that are breaking down supply chains
[3:33:26.580 --> 3:33:30.580]  that will starve tens of millions of additional people in the third world
[3:33:30.580 --> 3:33:34.580]  and destroy decades of human infrastructure that's been built.
[3:33:34.580 --> 3:33:39.580]  It will annihilate the funding of that and put the entire first world in even deeper debt,
[3:33:39.580 --> 3:33:41.580]  which we're being maneuvered into.
[3:33:41.580 --> 3:33:47.580]  So I really think the smart move is to end all these lockdowns immediately and prosecute the people
[3:33:47.580 --> 3:33:52.580]  that launched the giant COVID scam, the giant COVID con game.
[3:33:52.580 --> 3:33:54.580]  There's really just a big power grab.
[3:33:54.580 --> 3:33:58.580]  But in case we can't reverse all this, we better start digging in and getting horrible food
[3:33:58.580 --> 3:34:01.580]  and getting prepared to be self-sufficient because that's the name of their game,
[3:34:01.580 --> 3:34:06.580]  is to make us dependent on them. So get self-sufficient now in FullWars.com.
[3:34:06.580 --> 3:34:11.580]  I talk about all the horrible things that are happening and I point out that the globalist are a eugenics death cult
[3:34:11.580 --> 3:34:14.580]  because it's true. I don't say it to scare you.
[3:34:14.580 --> 3:34:16.580]  A lot of people say, man, this show is dark.
[3:34:16.580 --> 3:34:20.580]  Well, you've got to know you're dealing with evil if you're going to defeat it.
[3:34:20.580 --> 3:34:24.580]  And if we just listen to the surface of what the NWO propagandists are saying,
[3:34:24.580 --> 3:34:28.580]  they have reasons to sell this garbage to the general public.
[3:34:28.580 --> 3:34:31.580]  But if you just scratch the surface, they're so arrogant,
[3:34:31.580 --> 3:34:35.580]  they've all written detailed blueprints of this plan.
[3:34:35.580 --> 3:34:37.580]  And more and more being honest about it.
[3:34:37.580 --> 3:34:44.580]  Because there comes a point where, as David Icke says, they have to stop hiding it and start selling it.
[3:34:44.580 --> 3:34:47.580]  So we're at the point of the emergence now.
[3:34:47.580 --> 3:34:49.580]  And it's coming out in the open.
[3:34:49.580 --> 3:34:54.580]  And some people, under Mass.com syndrome, are going to submit to any level of tyranny
[3:34:54.580 --> 3:34:56.580]  but others are going to fight.
[3:34:56.580 --> 3:35:01.580]  This isn't like some old dictatorship that you could submit to it and join it and be okay.
[3:35:01.580 --> 3:35:06.580]  Now, this thing is post-human and extermination research, what that is.
[3:35:09.580 --> 3:35:13.580]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[3:35:13.580 --> 3:35:31.580]  Welcome back to the last hour of the Alex Jones Show.
[3:35:31.580 --> 3:35:35.580]  Here with your host and moderator today, Bishop Larry Gators.
[3:35:35.580 --> 3:35:42.580]  I am so very honored to be a student of my mentor, Brother Alex Jones.
[3:35:42.580 --> 3:35:45.580]  And we're talking about the coming destruction of Black Lives Matter.
[3:35:45.580 --> 3:35:52.580]  As a side note, the founder of the Nation of Islam was a white man by the name of Wallace Ford,
[3:35:52.580 --> 3:36:00.580]  a Wally B. Ford, or Ford from New Zealand, whose parents were born in central British India.
[3:36:00.580 --> 3:36:05.580]  So we have to expose this for what it is, okay?
[3:36:05.580 --> 3:36:08.580]  So we're talking about the coming destruction of Black Lives Matter.
[3:36:08.580 --> 3:36:12.580]  Three witches control Black Lives Matter.
[3:36:12.580 --> 3:36:20.580]  So there are no strong Black male leaders heading any of the 16 chapters of Black Lives Matter
[3:36:20.580 --> 3:36:23.580]  here in the United States and in Canada.
[3:36:23.580 --> 3:36:29.580]  And if you want to know where the geographical location of all of these 16 chapters,
[3:36:29.580 --> 3:36:36.580]  go to the website, blacklivesmatter.com, blacklivesmatter.com, or.org, and go under chapters.
[3:36:36.580 --> 3:36:45.580]  And it will show you 16 chapters, which represents the 16 points of that witchcraft
[3:36:45.580 --> 3:36:57.580]  divinational religion, they are many, called Odu Ifa, capital O-D-U, then space Ifa, capital I-F-A.
[3:36:57.580 --> 3:37:00.580]  These are witches, okay?
[3:37:00.580 --> 3:37:09.580]  As we're talking about Alicia Garza Swartz, okay? Opa Tometi, and there with Patrice Cullors.
[3:37:09.580 --> 3:37:16.580]  Patrice Cullors is a witch, not because she's a woman, and not because she's a Black woman.
[3:37:16.580 --> 3:37:25.580]  This woman here, not just Alicia Garza and Opa Tometi, but Patrice Cullors, she is a witch.
[3:37:25.580 --> 3:37:30.580]  She is cursing the people in that audience as we speak.
[3:37:30.580 --> 3:37:33.580]  And this is the reason why they have to be destroyed.
[3:37:33.580 --> 3:37:38.580]  I don't have a problem with Black Lives Matter exposing police corruption,
[3:37:38.580 --> 3:37:44.580]  but my problem is, is the total representation of Black Lives Matter.
[3:37:44.580 --> 3:37:51.580]  Why? Because the deep state through the demon-radic party for centuries
[3:37:51.580 --> 3:38:01.580]  has both manipulated the historical pain and totally weaponized the historical trauma
[3:38:01.580 --> 3:38:04.580]  of a people who don't know who they are.
[3:38:04.580 --> 3:38:12.580]  So then these women are going to be destroyed because the premise of their foundation
[3:38:12.580 --> 3:38:16.580]  is not in Our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.
[3:38:16.580 --> 3:38:26.580]  The premise of the foundation is upon victimhood through witchcraft and debonational curses.
[3:38:26.580 --> 3:38:30.580]  So Black Lives Matter, your days on number.
[3:38:30.580 --> 3:38:39.580]  So Black Lives Matter has its roots in Genesis 6, Enoch 6, and Jude 6666.
[3:38:39.580 --> 3:38:52.580]  Odu Aifa is also one of the acronym names for Lucifer L, Satan S, W, D, that's LSD.
[3:38:52.580 --> 3:38:59.580]  So the first time Lucifer is made mention in the Word of the Lord is in Isaiah 14 and 12.
[3:38:59.580 --> 3:39:06.580]  The first time the word Satan is made mention is in 1 Chronicles 21 verse 1.
[3:39:06.580 --> 3:39:10.580]  The first time devil is made mention is in Matthew chapter 4 verse 3.
[3:39:10.580 --> 3:39:16.580]  That woman, she's a witch, these lesbian witches.
[3:39:16.580 --> 3:39:26.580]  And let me say this also, in Revelation 12 and 4, one third of the angelic government of God
[3:39:26.580 --> 3:39:32.580]  was trying to overthrow the throne of God's thinking.
[3:39:32.580 --> 3:39:39.580]  I'm not talking about some old man like people say God is sitting on a chair, no.
[3:39:39.580 --> 3:39:46.580]  Throne students means the thought in the algorithm of God's thinking.
[3:39:46.580 --> 3:39:55.580]  So in Genesis 6, Enoch 6, Jude 6666, social historical separation and distancing.
[3:39:55.580 --> 3:40:05.580]  In Revelation chapter 12 verse 4, a third part of the angels of God who represent Black Lives Matter today.
[3:40:05.580 --> 3:40:24.580]  A third part, or 0.93, or 666% of the angelic government was infected with the tale of Lucifer.
[3:40:24.580 --> 3:40:33.580]  Now if you take the word Lucifer, or Lucifer students, then spell it or write it from right to left
[3:40:33.580 --> 3:40:37.580]  because rabbinical Hebrew is written from right to left.
[3:40:37.580 --> 3:40:45.580]  You get the Latin word, refacle, which means the recycling of fecal matter.
[3:40:45.580 --> 3:40:49.580]  That is the essence of Black Lives Matter.
[3:40:49.580 --> 3:41:01.580]  The way of the recycling of the fecal matter of Lucifer L, Satan S, WD, there's your LSD.
[3:41:01.580 --> 3:41:08.580]  In Ezekiel chapter 28 verse 13, the king called Tyrus.
[3:41:08.580 --> 3:41:14.580]  Now the term Tyrus in relation to Black Lives Matter and the coming destruction of Black Lives Matter.
[3:41:14.580 --> 3:41:20.580]  The term Tyrus comes from two Persian lexicon meanings.
[3:41:20.580 --> 3:41:26.580]  Ty, capital T-Y, means to be attached, so Ty.
[3:41:26.580 --> 3:41:34.580]  Then the word Ross R-U-S is not just an acronym meaning Prussian or Russian.
[3:41:34.580 --> 3:41:48.580]  The term Ross R-U-S, rabbinically through the Persian lexicon, means one of the gods within the Persian Empire called, get this, Lenol.
[3:41:48.580 --> 3:41:52.580]  Capital L-E-N-O-L.
[3:41:52.580 --> 3:42:12.580]  When you say Ty, Lenol, you're talking about pharmacia, pharmaceutical, pharmacy, alchemical, witchcraft, through the manipulation of reality, time and probability,
[3:42:12.580 --> 3:42:26.580]  in connection to the manipulation of perceived reality, through the manipulation of perceived control, in which the deep state has layered Black Lives Matter,
[3:42:26.580 --> 3:42:33.580]  as a sign of the manipulation below in manipulation, below in manipulation.
[3:42:33.580 --> 3:42:39.580]  But I am called to be an apostolic assassin in a Pentecostal mercenary.
[3:42:39.580 --> 3:42:46.580]  I have no mercy for witches, as we're talking about the coming destruction of Black Lives Matter.
[3:42:46.580 --> 3:42:54.580]  Now, in our conclusion, when you look at the Hollywood Industrial Complex, excellent length here,
[3:42:54.580 --> 3:43:04.580]  so Black Lives Matter founders, they are running a scam in the name of occultism.
[3:43:04.580 --> 3:43:15.580]  Okay, when you go back to a former slave by the name of Nat Turner, okay, when you study the origins of Nat Turner,
[3:43:15.580 --> 3:43:24.580]  his slave master in the Hamptons was an attorney by the name of Judah Philip Benjamin.
[3:43:24.580 --> 3:43:34.580]  Judah Philip Benjamin, who was the former slave master of Nat Turner, Judah Philip Benjamin created the KKK.
[3:43:34.580 --> 3:43:38.580]  Newsflash, why did America please hear the Bishop?
[3:43:38.580 --> 3:43:44.580]  Why did America had nothing to do with the creation of the KKK?
[3:43:44.580 --> 3:44:00.580]  It was Kinsarian monsters, by Warchow money, okay, including the Vatican, in 1865 in Pulaski, Tennessee, created the Ku Klux Klan.
[3:44:00.580 --> 3:44:07.580]  So, not only has Black America been lied to, white America has been lied to.
[3:44:07.580 --> 3:44:15.580]  White people, listen, do not bow down to any Black Lives Matter organizational member.
[3:44:15.580 --> 3:44:19.580]  If you do, you'll curse. Do not bow down.
[3:44:19.580 --> 3:44:23.580]  I wish to God that someone would come to me to tell me to bow down to him.
[3:44:23.580 --> 3:44:29.580]  No, you only bow down to our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ.
[3:44:29.580 --> 3:44:30.580]  Why?
[3:44:30.580 --> 3:44:36.580]  Because Black Lives Matter is going to be destroyed, okay?
[3:44:36.580 --> 3:44:46.580]  And as we end today's broadcast concerning the coming destruction of Black Lives Matter, they support pedophilia.
[3:44:46.580 --> 3:44:49.580]  They don't call pedophilia a crime.
[3:44:49.580 --> 3:44:55.580]  They call pedophilia a sexual orientation.
[3:44:55.580 --> 3:44:59.580]  Now, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, I'm praying that she gets healed in Jesus' name.
[3:44:59.580 --> 3:45:06.580]  She is trying to pass legal precedent, trying to normalize pedophilia.
[3:45:06.580 --> 3:45:23.580]  Black Lives Matter are proponents of transvestiteism, allowing transvestites and transgenders to teach your children in your school library that is going to be destroyed.
[3:45:23.580 --> 3:45:29.580]  And that is the end today of the coming destruction of Black Lives Matter.
[3:45:29.580 --> 3:45:37.580]  I thank you for your attention, students, and it's an honor to be a part of the Alex Jones family through Infowars.
