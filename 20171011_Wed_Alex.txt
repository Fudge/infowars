[00:00.000 --> 00:26.000]  You want to stop tyranny well so does he live from the infowars.com studios it's Alex Jones
[01:00.000 --> 01:06.000]  level misdemeanor so you knowingly give somebody a virus that can cause an autoimmune disease
[01:06.000 --> 01:13.000]  that makes you slowly die over five to ten years but that's okay Governor Jerry Brown signed it
[01:13.000 --> 01:22.000]  and talked about equality well it's not evil to have a disease be it leprosy HIV hepatitis
[01:22.000 --> 01:29.000]  whatever but it's certainly evil to give it to someone but they're saying no that's okay
[01:29.000 --> 01:33.000]  that's okay and I want to get into the psychology of the insane democratic party here because
[01:33.000 --> 01:39.000]  when HIV goes from a lower numbers like it is to exploding the next five years and a few years
[01:39.000 --> 01:45.000]  we're still here as a planet don't have nuclear war I will go back to this show and say here I am in 2017
[01:45.000 --> 01:52.000]  saying within three to five years California will have a 200% increase in HIV.
[01:52.000 --> 01:55.000]  Glad to be here at the AIDS Walk really important for getting a message out.
[01:55.000 --> 02:00.000]  They will also complain and say we need single-payer we need social health care the reason we have HIV
[02:00.000 --> 02:05.000]  is because we don't have free health care no the reason you have HIV is because it is a culture now
[02:05.000 --> 02:11.000]  in the gay community that I first read about 20 years ago in Rolling Stone to give other people HIV.
[02:11.000 --> 02:20.000]  It's truly nihilistic so here's the article progress LA Times knowingly exposing others to HIV
[02:20.000 --> 02:29.000]  no longer a felony in California it's the same thing as a parking ticket so it's essentially legalized
[02:29.000 --> 02:33.000]  and here's the LA Times Governor Jerry Brown signed a bill Friday that lowers from a felony to a
[02:33.000 --> 02:38.000]  misdemeanor the crime of knowingly exposing a sexual partner to HIV without disclosing the infection.
[02:38.000 --> 02:42.000]  How about hepatitis how about everything else the measure also applies to those who give blood
[02:42.000 --> 02:48.000]  without telling blood bank they're HIV positive oh wow don't tell the blood bank you're HIV positive
[02:48.000 --> 02:53.000]  this is a religion this is Satanism folks because they can get away with this thing with anything
[02:53.000 --> 02:58.000]  this is totally insane remember the Clintons for over a decade knew that all the blood coming out of their
[02:58.000 --> 03:02.000]  prisons was infected with HIV and hepatitis all of it because they would mix it together
[03:02.000 --> 03:07.000]  and they would sell it into Canada and say it was all clean and then Bayer would buy it
[03:07.000 --> 03:13.000]  turn into factor 8 and Bayer knew it all had HIV in it and they still shipped it out as population reduction
[03:13.000 --> 03:21.000]  it's in the documents so this takes bug chasing to a whole new level this isn't two guys getting together
[03:21.000 --> 03:28.000]  at you know in a bar bathroom or wherever okay this is this is children hemophiliacs getting it
[03:28.000 --> 03:35.000]  and there's a religion this is mainstream news of giving people HIV and then AIDS of killing them
[03:35.000 --> 03:40.000]  and then of wanting to get killed but see that's not enough of a thrill it's more of a
[03:40.000 --> 03:47.000]  sacrament for Jerry Brown to destroy the entire blood industry to destroy even further and then let
[03:47.000 --> 03:52.000]  the entire US blood supply be tainted again but it's okay it's like it's okay to teach five-year-olds
[03:52.000 --> 03:56.000]  you know that they're not really a man or not really a woman they're really something else in school
[03:56.000 --> 04:03.000]  pedophilia being normalized by mainstream news by the New York Times by Salon it's all about how far
[04:03.000 --> 04:08.000]  can they push you what can they get away with so read this again from the LA Times
[04:08.000 --> 04:12.000]  Governor Jerry Brown signed a bill Friday that lowers from a felony to a misdemeanor the crime of
[04:12.000 --> 04:17.000]  knowingly exposing a sexual partner to HIV without disclosing the infection the measure also applies to
[04:17.000 --> 04:21.000]  those who give blood without telling the blood bank they're HIV positive so you can go in give them
[04:21.000 --> 04:27.000]  the blood it infects the entire system and you kill a bunch of people but it's liberal so it's like
[04:27.000 --> 04:33.000]  well it's liberal California hepatitis an outbreak on the verge of statewide epidemic again most of
[04:33.000 --> 04:38.000]  us actually transmitted the illegals coming in but that's okay the black man on folks that are fascinated
[04:38.000 --> 04:44.000]  man intentionally poke holes in condoms to inflict grinder hookups with HIV well hell that's that's a
[04:44.000 --> 04:48.000]  good thing in California
[04:48.000 --> 04:53.000]  oh
[04:59.000 --> 05:03.000]  it was Thomas Jefferson who once said that our country is now taking so steady of course as to
[05:03.000 --> 05:08.000]  show by what road it will pass to destruction to wit by consolidation of power first and then corruption
[05:08.000 --> 05:13.000]  its necessary consequence Jefferson was warning us about the global elite the 1% of the 1%
[05:13.000 --> 05:17.000]  consolidating the world's wealth and subverting the people's voice in government
[05:17.000 --> 05:22.000]  unfortunately we didn't heed his advice we now live in a neo feudalistic society which were treated
[05:22.000 --> 05:26.000]  as indentured servants who only exist to serve the needs of the establishment political office no
[05:26.000 --> 05:30.000]  longer represents the voice of the people but rather the initiation process politicians go through
[05:30.000 --> 05:35.000]  to gain acceptance into the aristocracy simply put we the people are responsible for civilization
[05:35.000 --> 05:39.000]  and culture yet we're suppressed by a tiny elite who have organized into criminal gangs that
[05:39.000 --> 05:43.000]  operate governments around the world we falsely believe that everything is simply black and white
[05:43.000 --> 05:48.000]  one extreme against the other conservative versus liberal but things will change once more of us
[05:48.000 --> 05:53.000]  realize this truth as Thomas Jefferson also said in light of the people generally and tyranny
[05:53.000 --> 05:57.000]  and oppressions of the body and mind will vanish like evil spirits at the dawn of day this is Kit
[05:57.000 --> 06:01.000]  Daniels with info wars dot com
[06:01.000 --> 06:07.000]  you know Australia is a good example Canada is a good example the UK is a good example why
[06:07.000 --> 06:12.000]  because each of them had mass killings somebody somewhere will comment
[06:12.000 --> 06:16.000]  and say Obama politicized this issue
[06:16.000 --> 06:19.000]  well this is something we should politicize
[06:19.000 --> 06:22.000]  I'm not going to carry a gun I don't want to be involved in a gunfight
[06:22.000 --> 06:30.000]  if I could have gotten 51 votes in the senate of the United States for an outright ban
[06:30.000 --> 06:35.000]  picking up every one of them Mr. and Mrs. America turn them all in
[06:35.000 --> 06:41.000]  go ahead
[06:41.000 --> 06:43.000]  make my day
[06:43.000 --> 06:47.000]  so the notion that gun laws don't work it's not borne out by the evidence
[06:47.000 --> 06:53.000]  he says that the Chicago police had a plan over this bloody 4th of July weekend
[06:53.000 --> 06:59.000]  nonetheless as you indicated Corey there was a count of casualties that could have been from
[06:59.000 --> 07:06.000]  Afghanistan or Iraq will make it harder for law abiding citizens and criminals will still get their guns
[07:06.000 --> 07:14.000]  in many cases the offenders felons some out on parole some out on bond
[07:14.000 --> 07:21.000]  we have to respect the tradition in this country of people who want to defend themselves and their family from violence
[07:21.000 --> 07:27.000]  there are people at high levels in this government who have bodyguards
[07:27.000 --> 07:32.000]  24 hours a day 7 days a week the average American does not have that
[07:32.000 --> 07:38.000]  Mayor Bloomberg why can you defend yourself but not the majority of Americans
[07:38.000 --> 07:41.000]  I mean look at the team of security you got
[07:41.000 --> 07:47.000]  every day every school at every level one thing that I think is clear with young people and with adults as well
[07:47.000 --> 07:52.000]  is that we just have to be repetitive about this and we need to do this every day of the week
[07:52.000 --> 07:57.000]  and just really brainwash people into thinking about guns in a vastly different way
[07:57.000 --> 08:04.000]  was this the weapon of choice for a new kind of terrorist when a five-year-old girl said she and a classmate
[08:04.000 --> 08:09.000]  should shoot each other with bubbles the school called it a terrorist threat
[08:09.000 --> 08:13.000]  AK-47s belong in the hands of soldiers not in the hands of criminals
[08:13.000 --> 08:17.000]  you know the right to bear arms is because that's the last form of defense against tyranny
[08:17.000 --> 08:25.000]  lay down your arms you damn rebels but we don't need the ability to arm ourselves against the army or the police
[08:25.000 --> 08:28.000]  what kind of a situation in the U.S. would you see that happening
[08:28.000 --> 08:32.000]  I mean we've got a lot of constitution listening to a lot of people that stockpile weapons
[08:32.000 --> 08:37.000]  Governor the clergy would help the government with potentially their biggest problem
[08:37.000 --> 08:46.000]  us to say we're not turning our guns in and we're not running and we're not knocking down if you want a commentation
[08:46.000 --> 08:51.000]  rallying Patriots Worldwide the defense of human liberty
[08:51.000 --> 08:54.000]  it's Alec Jones
[09:06.000 --> 09:15.000]  they are preparing a violent overthrow sometime in November October now why do you think the communists are suddenly uncloking themselves
[09:15.000 --> 09:22.000]  because after growing under the floorboards they want to look like a legitimate government when they take over
[09:22.000 --> 09:29.000]  and when they call for the racial war when they call for the uprising this is this is a playbook and it's from them
[09:29.000 --> 09:34.000]  they're saying this is happening and they're being allowed to prepare and gear up for it
[09:34.000 --> 09:44.000]  what will it be in a month
[09:44.000 --> 09:50.000]  what will it be in just a few weeks what will it be
[09:50.000 --> 10:00.000]  it's snuck up on us hasn't it it's the October Revolution that stretched into November and December
[10:00.000 --> 10:07.000]  it's the 100 year anniversary of the Bolshevik Revolution
[10:07.000 --> 10:16.000]  we're here it's happening now this is real what are you going to do about it it's a big question you've got to ask yourself
[10:16.000 --> 10:23.000]  because they mean business
[10:23.000 --> 10:31.000]  we have to hold our fire but we have to be prepared and no they're coming over the line
[10:31.000 --> 10:38.000]  and we've got to be on target and ready and everybody's got to start packing
[10:38.000 --> 10:44.000]  because when they strike it'll be like fire ants where they crawl up over your legs
[10:44.000 --> 10:49.000]  when they get in place one of them that's leading and it's all genetically engineered
[10:49.000 --> 10:54.000]  by mother nature that way stings you releases a pheromone and all the others sting
[10:54.000 --> 11:00.000]  once they get in place they communicate by pheromones and it's the same thing
[11:00.000 --> 11:07.000]  they get all over you they get in place and it's going to be boom you wake up one morning and 300 cops are dead
[11:07.000 --> 11:13.000]  you wake up and talk show host and members of Congress are wiped out
[11:13.000 --> 11:24.000]  Trump towers from Chicago to New York are on fire so the police don't think they can respond
[11:24.000 --> 11:31.000]  but there'll be something that happens right before that a mass shooting at a school
[11:31.000 --> 11:38.000]  a bombing of a federal building maybe more pinned on a right-wing patsy who's a listener of this show
[11:38.000 --> 11:43.000]  that's why they're putting us all over the news and putting us on Comedy Central with all their drooling viewers
[11:43.000 --> 11:50.000]  to go here's the bad guy here's the terrorist get ready for this when it all happens it's his fault
[11:50.000 --> 12:04.000]  he made his followers do it so they false flag and they'll blame Alex Jones and Donald Trump and Matt Drudge and Rush Limbaugh
[12:04.000 --> 12:09.000]  and even a lot of other conservative talk show host will kind of halfway get go along with it because they'll think
[12:09.000 --> 12:14.000]  oh my competition's about to get shut down no idiot you're about to get shut down
[12:14.000 --> 12:19.000]  Bolshevik style that's how it worked the Bolshevik said we've just seized Moscow
[12:19.000 --> 12:26.000]  but if you turn in your guns and work with us to some of the other political parties we'll let you rule with us
[12:26.000 --> 12:32.000]  and just help us get the white Russians to help us get the Christian Russians just help us get the pro czarist
[12:32.000 --> 12:41.000]  just help us get that one group and then you're going to be fine and then they just killed people with each new group of moron traders
[12:41.000 --> 12:52.000]  that lowered the drawbridge so we're here and I'm sure of it that this whole NFL thing was the activation of this
[12:52.000 --> 13:00.000]  my sources concur with that it's not gone well for them so if there's a big terror attack that they blame on patriots
[13:00.000 --> 13:05.000]  or Christians or conservatives or independent media since they want to shut down
[13:05.000 --> 13:12.000]  not if when you'll have two or three days of them hyping it to get people to a fever pitch so they can make it look like it was organic
[13:12.000 --> 13:19.000]  but by the second or third night you've got to be you want to stop these folks you got to be basically eyes and ears
[13:19.000 --> 13:26.000]  and they're going to hit at night they're going to start at about 10 o'clock at night you got to be waiting on them
[13:26.000 --> 13:31.000]  two to three days after I don't think they're going to change their operation this is too tried and true
[13:31.000 --> 13:39.000]  you got to be waiting for them ladies and gentlemen because they're going to try to overwhelm the police forces in cities that don't control first
[13:39.000 --> 13:46.000]  they're going to lay them out they may also do it in cities they control as they know the police chief will be involved in it
[13:46.000 --> 13:57.000]  and will order basically a stand down so they're going to make their move that's where everybody's on edge
[13:57.000 --> 14:10.000]  and we've really tried to fix this as peacefully as we can and if the attorney general who's completely surrounded I know doesn't move on these forces
[14:10.000 --> 14:18.000]  you need to understand the antifa idiots are just going to be the cover for the squads and some of the other specialized groups
[14:18.000 --> 14:27.000]  that they're going to be using to decapitate and they think intimidate and confuse patriot government
[14:27.000 --> 14:31.000]  but you better believe they're going to try to kill conservative Supreme Court justices
[14:31.000 --> 14:35.000]  you better believe they're going to try to kill Judge Roy Moore people like that
[14:35.000 --> 14:49.000]  I mean it's folks you know they're coming for you they're coming for you October is only a few days away
[14:49.000 --> 15:01.000]  they're saying their operation launches November 4th that's probably a diversion
[15:01.000 --> 15:08.000]  I think the attacks coming in the middle of October that's just looking at all the pieces
[15:08.000 --> 15:15.000]  I'd say look for middle of October but first look for a new Charlottesville much bigger or a group of Charlottesville
[15:15.000 --> 15:23.000]  that's going to be the cover for the detonation
[15:23.000 --> 15:32.000]  that's just one of the videos clipped out of the live show from Friday September 28th 2017
[15:32.000 --> 15:37.000]  where I said I think they'd attack it like something like 10 o'clock at night to trigger the revolution
[15:37.000 --> 15:47.000]  and I had some FBI folks call up some of our team and say how did Alex know that what are his sources
[15:47.000 --> 15:55.000]  does he have any information and I said yeah it's the Democratic Party Soros and all the liberals are saying come October 1st we're coming to kill you
[15:55.000 --> 15:58.000]  and I said they'd probably attack at 10 o'clock at night

[20:28.000 --> 20:49.000]  what's behind the entire Weinstein firestorm what's behind it is Hollywood's collapsing the money's not there anymore and the rats are leaving the sinking ship
[20:49.000 --> 21:16.000]  the Matt Damon's and others the Ben Affleck's are being forced to reverse their cover ups for Mr. Weinstein and as the invincibility aura dissipates the pedophilia is going to come out next and that's what they feel nipping at their heels breathing down their necks
[21:16.000 --> 21:34.000]  is the fact that the American people and patriots in law enforcement and the populace Trump revolution and this broadcast is all just part of a worldwide move against the satanic pedophile elites
[21:34.000 --> 21:55.000]  Hungary's government has come out and declared George Soros a quote agent of Satan and their secretary of state their prime minister they've all come out and said it's their Christian duty to fight against Satan slash Soros plan
[21:55.000 --> 22:07.000]  and they are sending nationwide to all the homes documents and quotes by Soros admitting the plan to destroy Europe and turn it over to Islam
[22:07.000 --> 22:27.000]  now what have I said a thousand times and I'll say it again if you have a private corporate above the law tax free world government that also backs authoritarianism once you expose it it's dead it may take a while to remove the face sucker it may take a while to remove the parasite
[22:27.000 --> 22:45.000]  but once you're aware that Hollywood's a parasite once you're aware that George Soros is a parasite once you're aware that royalties a parasite and once you're aware of all these unelected corrupt systems that we pay for that we live under it's over
[22:45.000 --> 22:56.000]  it's worse than garbage it's worse than something you take out to the curb it's something you throw into the deepest pit of the ocean
[22:56.000 --> 23:04.000]  so I can tell you historically and culturally the tide isn't just going out on globalism
[23:04.000 --> 23:12.000]  globalism is a dead letter globalism is the plague
[23:12.000 --> 23:35.000]  globalism is a failure and as bad as the death rows are of the Hollywood combine and the NFL and late night talk shows and so-called comedians reading off teleprompters it's just that frothing agonizing melting away death rows
[23:35.000 --> 23:43.000]  and that's it and you've got to ask yourselves what are they going to do to try to stop us
[23:43.000 --> 23:48.000]  well they're going to try to start wars they're going to try to start culture wars they're going to try everything they can
[23:48.000 --> 24:02.000]  but the giant Ponzi scheme that's mainstream media and the giant Ponzi scheme that's the Fortune 100 corporations that all dreamed of how they were building this great world government where they'd be gods in the Elysium fields
[24:02.000 --> 24:08.000]  and all us mere mortals would be down here not even aware of their global government
[24:08.000 --> 24:18.000]  well guess what you miscalculated you thought enough people would just go along with the New York Times and the ADL and Southern Primary Law Center and the Washington Post
[24:18.000 --> 24:31.000]  beating people over the head calling them all these names if they didn't submit
[24:31.000 --> 24:44.000]  they thought you could bully us but all you did with your hen pecking over and over trying to keep us in line you thought you had us intimidated and scared
[24:44.000 --> 24:58.000]  really we were in a deep sleep it's like trying to keep us in line you thought you were so powerful you thought you dominated us and finally went what is that pecking on my head
[24:58.000 --> 25:13.000]  some gremlin creature how about I just break your neck how's that feel now it's eyes are bugged out it's arms legs are scrabbling an arm got a few scratches
[25:13.000 --> 25:30.000]  how about we just throw you into a pit of hell bye bye take all of it with you your red carpets all your glitter bug narcissism garbage and go fall off a cliff
[25:30.000 --> 25:36.000]  and break your neck down there politically culturally spiritually like every other failed system in history
[25:36.000 --> 25:55.000]  it is ladies and gentlemen a true time that prize humanity souls on this Wednesday October 11th 2017 worldwide broadcast and I'm your host we're going to be live here for the next three and a half hours now
[25:55.000 --> 26:13.000]  you have left in the broadcast and let's just do something different today I've got enough news and powerful clips wow fill a whole day and we'll get to a lot of it but I really do want to early on take your calls first time callers on the fall of Hollywood
[26:13.000 --> 26:33.000]  NFL the fall of the Democratic Party the beginning of the fall of the Republican establishment and the fall of the EU and the fall of the Islamic takeover Arab spring and just the misfire the backfire that is globalism
[26:33.000 --> 27:02.000]  becoming unclogged and the really accelerated beginning of their cultural destruction this has been the reign of the pedophile devil worshipers and it doesn't mean it's going to end quickly but while humanity slept they leave their webs
[27:02.000 --> 27:19.000]  but the sun always comes back and we're not just in the early morning hours now the sun is starting to rise high into the sky and the night creatures are beginning to feel the heat
[27:19.000 --> 27:41.000]  and when the sun rises to the high point it will be the complete end of the age for the globalist and that's where we are and they know it and they think AI is going to save them and they think telling you they're invincible is going to save them
[27:41.000 --> 27:56.000]  because they all know their losers they all know their fakes they all know their frauds they all know their jokes they all know no one really wants to be around them and they've never had real love and they'll never get real love and so they want to destroy all that's good
[27:56.000 --> 28:19.000]  when you hear these hairy Weinstein tapes and you hear all this other garbage and you hear the brothers defense and Harvey Weinstein you realize that he's not wanting to have sex with these beautiful women or put them on a pedestal and make them have a good time
[28:19.000 --> 28:38.000]  he is enjoying as I predicted days ago last week before the tapes came out because I just want to show folks what I'm talking about we ought to we ought to find that when I said you see it isn't the sex he wants it's the power

[32:49.000 --> 33:04.000]  older more expensive filters that didn't do as good a job find out why this system is so revolutionary today then for our store.com you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[33:19.000 --> 33:42.000]  I am a shotgun rider for the San Jacinto line the desert is my brother my skin is cracked and dry I was riding on the full coast and everything was fine till we took a shorter road to save some time bandits only fired once bandits only fired once they shot me in the chest
[33:42.000 --> 33:53.000]  they may have wounded me but they'll never get the best of better men welcome back folks I'm your host Alex Jones.
[33:53.000 --> 34:07.000]  Waging war on corruption it's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the info war.
[34:07.000 --> 34:15.000]  I'm going to give the phone number out for first time callers again today so all of you can get involved on air with us on this Wednesday global transmission.
[34:15.000 --> 34:38.000]  The number to join us is 877-789-ALAX 877-789-ALEX is the number to join us we don't screen your calls other than you have a good phone line and that you're calling in and want to basically get on air we'd like to know how you're listening if you'd like to volunteer that's we can plug some of our affiliates out there as well.
[34:38.000 --> 34:58.000]  But again the number is 877-789-ALAX. I don't really have glee to see Hollywood and the NFL and the whole mentally ill media complex faltering because I knew it was going to collapse.
[34:58.000 --> 35:10.000]  And I'm already basically so sick of looking at them and hearing from them just like you are that I almost don't want to begin doing a forced mortem.
[35:10.000 --> 35:34.000]  Review of their body politic but it's got to be done and see the same reason I'm disgusted by them and you're disgusted by them just the same way I can't even play clips from all these history channel and discovery channel and HBO and.
[35:34.000 --> 35:42.000]  Comedy Central shows that lie about yours truly and make up things I never said.
[35:42.000 --> 35:51.000]  Because I just am so divorced from them so separate that I can't even look at it to review it.
[35:51.000 --> 36:08.000]  And that's when you know you've really broken the back of the stalker. If you've ever had a stalker as soon as you really don't care about them and just forgive them but don't want to give it any attention they just metaphysically pick up on it and go away.
[36:08.000 --> 36:23.000]  It's psychic vampire behavior and you've got to understand folks this is the big truth Hollywood mainstream media corporate systems are loser collections of scum that want to be in power.
[36:23.000 --> 36:36.000]  That want to be in charge and want to control the great engine of America and our individualism and our entrepreneurship and our will.
[36:36.000 --> 36:44.000]  And so they wanted to make the host weak and controllable while still exploiting it.
[36:44.000 --> 36:47.000]  But like fire.
[36:47.000 --> 36:58.000]  That spirit is a dangerous servant and a fearful master to borrow a phrase from our first president George Washington.
[36:58.000 --> 37:16.000]  He was saying government is like fire a dangerous servant and fearful master. Yes. But when you've conquered freedom when you believe you have your thumb on the people on fly over country on Christians and you want to beat the well out of them because you you you feel they're struggling away.
[37:16.000 --> 37:39.000]  You understand people like Harvey Weinstein calling in these models calling in these these fawning women to put them up on a pedestal because they believe that they fond and gobbled to this dead possum on the side of the road.
[37:39.000 --> 37:54.000]  That's what the Satanist wants. That's what the ugly demon wants spiritually ugly is to have all these people fawning and all this beauty fawning at it so that it can make you think it's what is shining.
[37:54.000 --> 38:09.000]  That's why Satan is going to use up children torture children and kill children and destroy children's innocence and if they can't do it to your child if they can't get their hands on every child. How are they going to do it.
[38:09.000 --> 38:24.000]  They're lowering IQ. They're going to do it through the floor right. They admit is lowering IQ. It's all playing. They're going to do it through GMO. They admit destroying the genetics. They're going to do it through the culture of two plus equals five common core.
[38:24.000 --> 38:43.000]  They're raising your children on Nickelodeon. That's an admitted plan teaching your children about their twisted view of the human condition because that's all they've got is soulless servants of Satan of soulless servants of that archetype.
[38:43.000 --> 39:00.000]  They believe in the devil. They manifest it. So it's real because they are so incredibly desperate on their knees and they know if you just go live a good wholesome happy life that you'll be free of them.
[39:00.000 --> 39:16.000]  It's like the spider. It wants to catch you in the web. So when you listen to Ambra Gutierrez of Filipino Italian beauty when he's calling her in.
[39:16.000 --> 39:29.000]  He starts at first. He's the man that he's begging. He's begging. He goes, I do this all the time. I can't have you say no. I do this all the time. He has nothing to do with wanting to have sex with a woman or love a woman or be with a woman.
[39:29.000 --> 39:43.000]  It's all about dominating, controlling and just to show you. I know the enemy just to show you just of last week I said it isn't about the sex with the women.
[39:43.000 --> 39:53.000]  He tells just two days ago I said it before it broke. I said that's why he's got two or three coming through a day and bringing them on these tours.
[39:53.000 --> 40:02.000]  And I said notice they come out looking completely freaked out because folks, these are the women that said no that didn't go to the next steps.
[40:02.000 --> 40:21.000]  Let me tell you, he wants those women to feel humiliated and scared. Those are the ones that Pennywise or Harvey Weinstein wants because he can't feed on your energy unless you're repulsed.
[40:21.000 --> 40:35.000]  He doesn't want the women to have a great time. He doesn't want to empower women. He wants to squat on them satanically on the great energy God gave us through women.
[40:35.000 --> 40:49.000]  Foremost except for children and that's the fruit of the woman's womb. They want your children, the abortion, the partial birth, all of it is their sacrament.
[40:49.000 --> 41:04.000]  And when you listen to him dripping and slithering and no, no, no, no, it's like the performance in the new it when Pennywise is just like an angler fishes light hung out front of the real spider behind it.
[41:04.000 --> 41:13.000]  When it can't scare you, it can't feed because it's spiritual feeding.
[41:13.000 --> 41:21.000]  And then you understand the bullying of everybody by these people. That's all it is is they want to run your mind.
[41:21.000 --> 41:34.000]  They want your soul. They want to feed off your fear. They want to have your children play video games that are designed to scramble their brains and give them permanent basically electronic induced autism.
[41:34.000 --> 41:52.000]  They want to disassociate everyone because these are truly, truly, truly completely and absolutely evil people turned over to the abyss.
[41:52.000 --> 41:57.000]  And of course she went to the NYPD and they did nothing.
[41:57.000 --> 42:07.000]  You can do whatever you want as long as you go along with the big banks and the globalist and as long as you give political contributions.
[42:07.000 --> 42:16.000]  You think they just have reports of women where Weinstein tries to force women into a watching in a shower.
[42:16.000 --> 42:26.000]  You really think you really think that.
[42:26.000 --> 42:38.000]  He's into the revulsion. See, there's something a lot sweeter than just in his little spider brain than degrading women and we all know it.
[42:38.000 --> 42:44.000]  You can take one look at this man. You can take one look at Dennis Astor.
[42:44.000 --> 42:51.000]  You can take one look at any of them and they always have that same little piggy look in the eye.
[42:51.000 --> 42:58.000]  They always got the look. They always love their father Satan.
[43:21.000 --> 43:28.000]  They love the people to alter or to abolish it and to institute new government.
[43:28.000 --> 43:35.000]  Independence isn't a day. It's a mindset, an attitude that says I will not be your dependent. I will not be your slave.
[43:35.000 --> 43:41.000]  Dependence and slavery is a chain that is forged link by link with gradual infringements.
[43:41.000 --> 43:46.000]  When you trade your liberty for safety, to that extent you become their slave.
[43:46.000 --> 43:51.000]  The slaves are never safe. You won't get rich by being a slave.
[43:51.000 --> 43:56.000]  Guard your liberty, regard with suspicion anyone who tries to take it.
[43:56.000 --> 44:19.000]  From I'm David Dye.

[47:30.000 --> 47:45.000]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance.
[47:45.000 --> 47:50.000]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[47:50.000 --> 48:03.000]  In the 50s and 60s and 70s folks were into radicals. It was the devil. The devil was going to jump the buses with the motorcycle.
[48:03.000 --> 48:07.000]  The devil was the astronaut and the devil was the cowboy.
[48:07.000 --> 48:15.000]  The devil isn't a trailblazer ladies and gentlemen. The devil swindles you and leaves you starving to death in the desert.
[48:15.000 --> 48:27.000]  The devil steals your soul, steals your will. The devil likes to grab kids out of their backyards and make them beg for mommy for a couple months till they give up.
[48:27.000 --> 48:32.000]  That's right. That's what psychopaths always want is people giving up.
[48:32.000 --> 48:42.000]  Going through total horror and then giving up, giving up on God, surrendering to evil.
[48:42.000 --> 48:51.000]  That's the liqueur. That's the melange. That's the spice. That's the essence.
[48:51.000 --> 48:55.000]  That's the very blood that they're looking for.
[48:55.000 --> 49:15.000]  A man, a Harvey Weinstein or his vampire wife. Let's put this vampire on television. Ms. Chapman. Ms. Chapman. I mean another plastic rubber, nothing. That is just the front person for him to be the married man with two children.
[49:15.000 --> 49:28.000]  He had no idea what was going on. The poor lady. What if we looked perfect like her? Wouldn't it be amazing?
[49:28.000 --> 49:37.000]  Can you imagine how soulless that woman is going to climb into bed with that circus clown?
[49:37.000 --> 49:48.000]  Harvey Weinstein. And the big joke in Hollywood was about how everybody's got to sleep with Harvey if he wanted to be in the movies.
[49:48.000 --> 49:59.000]  And then if he didn't think bad, well, if he didn't submit, he'd come after you. And so would Matt Damon, the big virtue signaler that says we should all take refugees in but doesn't take one.
[49:59.000 --> 50:11.000]  Or Ben Afflank or any of these other people. I mean, it's gone from a halfway watch a movie to now. I can't watch any of them. None of the new movies.
[50:11.000 --> 50:19.000]  I got to go watch old classics because they had their own problems, but they weren't just weaponized evil.
[50:19.000 --> 50:32.000]  Now, Matt's put together a powerful video. We're going to air next hour if we take calls of Hollywood making jokes about Weinstein in the past and drudgerport.com is linked to one of Paul Watson's articles breaking all this down.
[50:32.000 --> 50:39.000]  And we should upload the video you didn't map without my commentary and just add it to that drudgerport articles. Good compilation.
[50:39.000 --> 50:51.000]  But let's play Weinstein, the head of Miramax. Notice all minimize danger. It's all a big PR deal. Like, oh, first they fired him so they could separate their money from all the lawsuits.
[50:51.000 --> 51:00.000]  And then, oh, she's leaving. It's all rolled out in a PR fashion. And that's exactly what I thought this morning when I saw her leaving him.
[51:00.000 --> 51:06.000]  And I was talking to Zach, one of the producers in there about what he thought. He just said, oh, it was all just laid out systematically.
[51:06.000 --> 51:15.000]  See how we see the exact same thing because it's the truth. And so now it's just revolting.
[51:15.000 --> 51:26.000]  It's so uncool to be into Hollywood. It's so uncool to like their dumb movies. It's so uncool to be into the NFL.
[51:26.000 --> 51:38.000]  You know it's more proper than ever? Wrestling. Because it's right wing. It's stupid. It's ridiculous. Everyone's making fun of each other. It's completely fake and everybody admits it.
[51:38.000 --> 51:48.000]  People want genuine. And if it's fake, they want completely fake and completely absurd and completely stupid like Japanese television.
[51:48.000 --> 51:59.000]  If I want diversions, I want complete idiocy with nothing political involved. I love it. I crave it when I can find it.
[51:59.000 --> 52:03.000]  Just a gender-free comedy. Give it to me right now.
[52:03.000 --> 52:12.000]  Instead of all this weaponized comedy, even though it's killing all their ratings and killing the NFL and killing Hollywood, they can't stop.
[52:12.000 --> 52:23.000]  Just like Harvey Weinstein, up to three women a day, he wanted to do weird stuff in front of to horrify them because whatever demon it is that lives in him gets off on just grossing women out.
[52:23.000 --> 52:31.000]  You know, we ought to be thankful that's all we know, Mr. Herr Weinstein's in, but we all know you don't get to the top of Hollywood.
[52:31.000 --> 52:37.000]  So I've talked to folks high up in it.
[52:37.000 --> 52:44.000]  It's just a formality. Just say you hate Jesus Christ and you love Satan. And then whenever people say no, they go, oh, we just do that to get Christians out of the room.
[52:44.000 --> 52:48.000]  It's just a joke. We don't really believe in God.
[52:48.000 --> 52:53.000]  And then later you find out.
[52:53.000 --> 52:57.000]  Later you find out.
[52:57.000 --> 53:03.000]  Hey, Alex, you better get out of this party unless you like screwing kids. Excuse me?
[53:03.000 --> 53:09.000]  Oh, I'm just joking, but you better go if you don't like that kind of stuff.
[53:09.000 --> 53:13.000]  And I never even got very deep into Hollywood.
[53:13.000 --> 53:19.000]  And I had comments like that made and these were parties with some of the top names at them.
[53:19.000 --> 53:24.000]  And you see, folks, you can sell a service when I was just money wanting to get rid of you. Exactly.
[53:24.000 --> 53:34.000]  Because see, there might not have been that coming up at that party that night, but that's the spirit. That's the test. That's the stuff that goes on over and over.
[53:34.000 --> 53:38.000]  You want to be around the power, the money, the women throwing themselves at you.
[53:38.000 --> 53:47.000]  That's just the lures to get men and women watching like the, oh, the pretty people are there because right behind it is the big old angler fish.
[53:47.000 --> 53:59.000]  When we put an angler fish on screen for TV viewers, you know, they're the deep sea, 10,000, 15,000 foot deep big old black blue spotted things that look scarier than Geiger,
[53:59.000 --> 54:03.000]  HR Geiger's aliens with those big old crystalline teeth.
[54:03.000 --> 54:06.000]  Yeah, that's an artist rendering. Let's look at a real one.
[54:06.000 --> 54:12.000]  And they got a nice little pretty light bulb, a phosphorescent bulb out front.
[54:12.000 --> 54:17.000]  Well, they're little fishies think there might be something to eat and they come over.
[54:17.000 --> 54:21.000]  That's all Hollywood. See the pretty girl. There's a real one.
[54:21.000 --> 54:35.000]  Yeah. See the pretty people. You like them. Come closer in the dark. Come closer.
[54:35.000 --> 54:44.000]  Let's go out to break listening to the evil dark waters of the just the angler fish. This is just surface feeding,
[54:44.000 --> 54:53.000]  ruining women's innocence, dashing their dreams, getting off on them being defiled because it's not as good as a child, but it'll do for a snack.
[54:53.000 --> 54:59.000]  Let's hear Weinstein feeding.
[54:59.000 --> 55:05.000]  What do we have to do here? I'm going to take a shower. You sit there and have a drink.
[55:05.000 --> 55:10.000]  Can I stay on the bar? No, you must have an hour. No.
[55:10.000 --> 55:16.000]  I don't want to. I'm not doing anything. I'm sorry. I don't want to.
[55:16.000 --> 55:22.000]  Yesterday was a kind of aggressive. I need to know a person. I won't do a thing.
[55:22.000 --> 55:29.000]  I swear I won't. Just sit with me. Don't embarrass me in the hotel. I'm here all the time. I know, but I don't want to.
[55:29.000 --> 55:35.000]  Please sit there. Please. One minute. No, I can't. Go to the bathroom. Please. I don't want to do something. I don't want to.
[55:35.000 --> 55:41.000]  Come here. Listen to me. I want to go downstairs. I'm not going to do anything. You'll never see me again.
[55:41.000 --> 55:48.000]  If you embarrass me in this hotel. I'm not embarrassing you. It's just that I don't feel comfortable.
[55:48.000 --> 55:55.000]  Please. I'm not going to do anything. I swear at my children. Please come in on everything. I'm a famous guy.
[55:55.000 --> 56:01.000]  I'm feeling very uncomfortable right now. Please come in now. And one minute. And if you want to leave when the guy comes with my jacket.
[56:01.000 --> 56:06.000]  Why yesterday? You touched my wrist. Please. I'm sorry. Just come on. I'm used to that.
[56:06.000 --> 56:11.000]  Are you used to that? Just stick your hand in this drainage ditch. We bite it off.
[56:11.000 --> 56:16.000]  That's enough. Stop right there. See, they metaphysically have to get you to come into the room.
[56:16.000 --> 56:20.000]  I'm going to do something creepy. It's going to be bad. But just come in. It's going to be all right.
[56:20.000 --> 56:25.000]  And it's a lot creepier once you get in. You stick your arm in. He's going to bite it off.
[56:25.000 --> 56:33.000]  And he's going to make movies about how he does it. And he's going to star up there and watch himself.
[56:33.000 --> 56:40.000]  And there are a bunch of clowns. Let me tell you, it's my folks don't like them.
[56:40.000 --> 56:46.000]  They want to clown around. I'm ready to clown around with them.
[56:46.000 --> 56:50.000]  We're going to take these people down, ladies and gentlemen. But we need funding and the support.
[56:50.000 --> 56:54.000]  We need you to understand this is a total war. Spread the links, the articles, the videos.
[56:54.000 --> 56:59.000]  I ran into two women yesterday out taking care of errands that looked up from their phones.
[56:59.000 --> 57:04.000]  Separate women listening to the show. Just going around town. I'm not bragging.
[57:04.000 --> 57:09.000]  It shows the power of info war. And in both times, I didn't even know what apps they were listening to us on.
[57:09.000 --> 57:13.000]  I didn't even recognize it. It's beautiful. Keep spreading the word. It's changing the world.
[57:13.000 --> 57:19.000]  And we got 50% off on Brain Force, our new tropic. That special is going to end very, very soon.
[57:19.000 --> 57:23.000]  A lot of other specials. There's a new special, Super Combo.
[57:23.000 --> 57:28.000]  It's survival shield X2 and iodine and bio tricillinium for 40% off.
[57:28.000 --> 57:33.000]  That's a huge special. That's as big as we ever get with those two combined at infowarstore.com.
[57:33.000 --> 57:39.000]  And your funding doesn't build red carpets. It builds information warfare systems that are crushing enemies
[57:39.000 --> 57:42.000]  and savaging the forces of the New World Order.
[57:42.000 --> 58:06.000]  Leave by your war bombs. We'll drop these bombs politically on their heads.
[58:06.000 --> 58:15.000]  Our super high quality nascent iodine is an essential mineral sourced of 99.99% ultra pure deep earth iodine crystals.
[58:15.000 --> 58:23.000]  This essential mineral is necessary in order to produce thyroid hormones which influence every cell, tissue and organ in the body.
[58:23.000 --> 58:30.000]  With inadequate thyroid hormones, you may experience slow metabolism, lethargy, weight gain and overall brain fog.
[58:30.000 --> 58:36.000]  Survival shield X2 and bio tricillinium work together to support the systems in your body.
[58:36.000 --> 58:40.000]  Take control of your chemistry today with this super combo.
[58:40.000 --> 59:01.000]  Discover the power of survival shield X2 and bio tricillinium at infowarslife.com.
[59:11.000 --> 59:13.000]  And long lasting natural deodorant.

[1:00:17.000 --> 1:00:20.000]  How many times must I tell you baby?
[1:00:20.000 --> 1:00:22.000]  How many bridges are you on?
[1:00:22.000 --> 1:00:24.000]  Don Salazar just gave me...
[1:00:24.000 --> 1:00:26.000]  How many times must I tell you baby?
[1:00:26.000 --> 1:00:28.000]  Just ultra bombshell information.
[1:00:28.000 --> 1:00:33.000]  I used to say ultra bombshell every two years, now I say it every week.
[1:00:33.000 --> 1:00:38.000]  Because it's just the whole house of cards is coming down.
[1:00:38.000 --> 1:00:44.000]  And just politically, culturally, spiritually though.
[1:00:44.000 --> 1:00:51.000]  Going into this territory up against these people, they see infowars as a figurehead in the fight for human awakening.
[1:00:51.000 --> 1:01:05.000]  Because we are a fulcrum, a focal point, a rallying point, a standard, a signant, a logo, a symbol.
[1:01:05.000 --> 1:01:08.000]  But I don't even know how to respond to what I was just giving.
[1:01:08.000 --> 1:01:13.000]  This is not for dramatics. I gotta take a break at this point.
[1:01:13.000 --> 1:01:27.000]  People would think being proven absolutely right is fun, it's not.
[1:01:27.000 --> 1:01:31.000]  Because I wish we were wrong.
[1:01:31.000 --> 1:01:33.000]  There it is, folks.
[1:01:33.000 --> 1:01:38.000]  You put together all the other information, it's just as devastating.
[1:01:38.000 --> 1:01:43.000]  Mandalay Bay owner, what's being expressed by police may not be accurate.
[1:01:43.000 --> 1:01:49.000]  We cannot be certain about the most recent timeline that has been completely communicated publicly.
[1:01:49.000 --> 1:01:51.000]  And that's because they changed the timeline in the official story.
[1:01:51.000 --> 1:01:54.000]  There are multiple shooters, there are shooters all over town.
[1:01:54.000 --> 1:01:57.000]  The police wiped out some of the terror cells.
[1:01:57.000 --> 1:02:03.000]  And I don't know why Trump's covering up the fact it was an Islamic attack. Thank you.
[1:02:03.000 --> 1:02:08.000]  Las Vegas shooting timeline changes raises questions about hotel security police response.
[1:02:08.000 --> 1:02:14.000]  Newsweek, if ISIS was behind the Las Vegas attack, there's a terrifying reason why it hasn't proven it.
[1:02:14.000 --> 1:02:22.000]  Everything I told you day one, here we are at day 11, it's all coming out.
[1:02:22.000 --> 1:02:28.000]  And by the way, you know, people think it's cool to have the FBI call up and say,
[1:02:28.000 --> 1:02:34.000]  if the Catholics were interested, why do you say they'd attack at 10 o'clock at night?
[1:02:34.000 --> 1:02:37.000]  And you don't even have a real answer for it.
[1:02:37.000 --> 1:02:40.000]  And the FBI's like, yeah, that's real interesting.
[1:02:40.000 --> 1:02:43.000]  No, I'm not involved, so I'm fighting it.
[1:02:43.000 --> 1:02:46.000]  I mean, the Democrats say they're going to start killing everybody October 1st,
[1:02:46.000 --> 1:02:48.000]  the full attacks on November 4th.
[1:02:48.000 --> 1:02:52.000]  I figure they'll attack large crowds around 10 o'clock at night when there's maximum density
[1:02:52.000 --> 1:02:54.000]  and there's police shifts going on.
[1:02:54.000 --> 1:03:00.000]  I just come up with my research and I tell you my best estimation.
[1:03:00.000 --> 1:03:06.000]  And I don't have a crystal ball, but it's a little more than just analysis.
[1:03:06.000 --> 1:03:14.000]  And I mean, I said earlier in the week that Weinstein guaranteed like to humiliate women.
[1:03:14.000 --> 1:03:19.000]  Now, that's what they're all like in Hollywood. It's not a crystal ball.
[1:03:19.000 --> 1:03:26.000]  It's like once you realize these types, I used to read a lot of historical books when I was a teenager
[1:03:26.000 --> 1:03:31.000]  and I read some criminology books, not just Pulp Picture, but some serious ones,
[1:03:31.000 --> 1:03:33.000]  about how the police obsessed it on profiling.
[1:03:33.000 --> 1:03:36.000]  And I used to think, oh, people are more diverse than that.
[1:03:36.000 --> 1:03:40.000]  There's no way because nice people are diverse in their things they do,
[1:03:40.000 --> 1:03:42.000]  not criminals, psychopaths and others.
[1:03:42.000 --> 1:03:45.000]  There's like maybe 15 different types.
[1:03:45.000 --> 1:03:50.000]  And man, you just learned the groups, the types, and it's like how a wild hog acts,
[1:03:50.000 --> 1:03:56.000]  how a white-tailed deer acts, how a puma acts, how a moose acts, you know, how a squirrel acts,
[1:03:56.000 --> 1:03:59.000]  how a buzzard acts, how a fox acts.
[1:03:59.000 --> 1:04:07.000]  And you just, well, you learn how? How a Hollywood executive pedophile devil works for acts.
[1:04:07.000 --> 1:04:11.000]  You see, they want to humiliate children and innocents.
[1:04:11.000 --> 1:04:20.000]  Well, young, beautiful women, it's not about putting them on a pedestal, it's about, you know,
[1:04:20.000 --> 1:04:23.000]  using the bathroom on the floor and making them eat it.
[1:04:23.000 --> 1:04:33.000]  Oh, you want that starring role? You want 20 million? Call me God. Get on the ground and call that God.
[1:04:33.000 --> 1:04:37.000]  I'm Harvey Weinstein. You're not just going to worship me.
[1:04:37.000 --> 1:04:41.000]  You're going to, you're going to worship what I do on the ground.
[1:04:41.000 --> 1:04:45.000]  You want to just listen, listen.
[1:04:45.000 --> 1:04:49.000]  You're going to go with us to a little cabin in the woods next weekend and see what we really do.
[1:04:49.000 --> 1:04:54.000]  Because now that you're into this and you do this, you're going to see what we really do.
[1:04:54.000 --> 1:04:58.000]  You think it's just broads?
[1:04:58.000 --> 1:05:03.000]  Please listen carefully, because I'm about to point out three things that will save you a lot of money
[1:05:03.000 --> 1:05:07.000]  while you get high quality products and fund the InfoWare, a 360 win.
[1:05:07.000 --> 1:05:14.000]  Number one, when you choose AutoShip before checkout, we give you 10% off on your order at InfoWareShore.com.
[1:05:14.000 --> 1:05:19.000]  Number two, you're also able to get items that are out of stock when you sign up for AutoShip
[1:05:19.000 --> 1:05:22.000]  because we hold back a surplus for AutoShip customers.
[1:05:22.000 --> 1:05:27.000]  Number three, we're giving you free shipping on all orders above $50.
[1:05:27.000 --> 1:05:33.000]  Listeners have been requesting this for years because it's so easy to forget to reorder the products that you need each month.
[1:05:33.000 --> 1:05:40.000]  Just go to InfoWareShore.com, select your favorite product or products, click on AutoShip and choose how often you want us to send you another order.
[1:05:40.000 --> 1:05:47.000]  As you know, I coined the term 360 win and with the new AutoShip feature at InfoWareShore.com, this is a sure win.
[1:05:47.000 --> 1:05:49.000]  10% off on AutoShip.
[1:05:49.000 --> 1:05:53.000]  Win, win, win at InfoWareShore.com, free shipping on orders above $50.
[1:05:53.000 --> 1:05:58.000]  And all AutoStock items are never out of stock when you sign up for AutoShip.
[1:06:23.000 --> 1:06:32.000]  Hashtag Hollywood is dead.
[1:06:32.000 --> 1:06:36.000]  Daria, one of our great crew members and producers, just had that idea.
[1:06:36.000 --> 1:06:38.000]  She just sent that out on her Twitter.
[1:06:38.000 --> 1:06:42.000]  I'm going to retweet it here in a few minutes at Real Alex Jones.
[1:06:42.000 --> 1:06:49.000]  And so when you write articles or you post blurbs or you do graphics, hashtag Hollywood is dead.
[1:06:49.000 --> 1:06:54.000]  And I was thinking last night, Mike Sernovich texted me and he said, you know, you did your Bill Clinton's a rapist meme.
[1:06:54.000 --> 1:07:03.000]  You paid out about $200,000 in prizes to folks that confronted Bill and Hillary Clinton.
[1:07:03.000 --> 1:07:11.000]  Now, with the fact that he is a known rapist who settled rape cases, Bill Clinton's a rapist became really one of the main slogans of the campaign and devastated the enemy.
[1:07:11.000 --> 1:07:18.000]  Just like Hillary for Prison and Lock Her Up were pro-generated by the Information Warfare facility right here in the ATX.
[1:07:18.000 --> 1:07:23.000]  That means facilitated by you, the listener, you, the watcher.
[1:07:23.000 --> 1:07:26.000]  You are the resistance.
[1:07:26.000 --> 1:07:31.000]  So Daria put out, soulless servants of Satan.
[1:07:31.000 --> 1:07:34.000]  Hashtag Hollywood is dead.
[1:07:34.000 --> 1:07:36.000]  Don't you love Meathead?
[1:07:36.000 --> 1:07:39.000]  Rob Reiner?
[1:07:39.000 --> 1:07:41.000]  Meathead.
[1:07:41.000 --> 1:07:46.000]  Coming out a few weeks ago with his stupid Morgan Friedman video going,
[1:07:46.000 --> 1:07:48.000]  we are at war with Russia.
[1:07:48.000 --> 1:07:49.000]  They have attacked us.
[1:07:49.000 --> 1:07:51.000]  I can't do a good Morgan Friedman imitation.
[1:07:51.000 --> 1:07:58.000]  But just all of the same fake gravity and gravitas and it had happened.
[1:07:58.000 --> 1:08:01.000]  The Russians stole it and Trump didn't get in.
[1:08:01.000 --> 1:08:02.000]  No, no.
[1:08:02.000 --> 1:08:08.000]  And people keep asking me, like my children, they go, if everyone hates Trump so much, why did he get elected?
[1:08:08.000 --> 1:08:13.000]  And I said to my oldest daughter yesterday, I said, 13-year-old sweetheart.
[1:08:13.000 --> 1:08:16.000]  I said, sweetheart, that's the old corporate media.
[1:08:16.000 --> 1:08:18.000]  I said, do you watch Jimmy Kimmel?
[1:08:18.000 --> 1:08:19.000]  No.
[1:08:19.000 --> 1:08:20.000]  Who's that?
[1:08:20.000 --> 1:08:22.000]  Do you watch CNN?
[1:08:22.000 --> 1:08:23.000]  No.
[1:08:23.000 --> 1:08:26.000]  I mean, do you watch any of that?
[1:08:26.000 --> 1:08:27.000]  She goes, no.
[1:08:27.000 --> 1:08:29.000]  I go, what do you watch?
[1:08:29.000 --> 1:08:32.000]  She goes, will you?
[1:08:32.000 --> 1:08:34.000]  And I said, who do the people watch at your school?
[1:08:34.000 --> 1:08:35.000]  Well, you.
[1:08:35.000 --> 1:08:38.000]  I mean, I go to her school and this isn't about me bragging.
[1:08:38.000 --> 1:08:46.000]  But, like, every grade and then across the street, the high schoolers see me and it's like, it's Alex Jones.
[1:08:46.000 --> 1:08:51.000]  And I don't want to do this on camera because Hollywood stages stuff where people run up with paparazzi.
[1:08:51.000 --> 1:08:52.000]  I started in the 20s.
[1:08:52.000 --> 1:08:58.000]  They would stage cameras and newspapers there to make it look like they were news to get other news to pile on.
[1:08:58.000 --> 1:09:03.000]  But I can literally go out and walk in front of a high school in Austin when it lets out.
[1:09:03.000 --> 1:09:08.000]  And I will be mobbed with people wanting photos and autographs and people, I was just listening to you.
[1:09:08.000 --> 1:09:11.000]  They're not watching Angelina Jo Lee or Morgan Friedman.
[1:09:11.000 --> 1:09:19.000]  And again, I'm not even bragging.
[1:09:19.000 --> 1:09:27.000]  It's court ordered that I go to psychology meetings every two weeks with my daughters.
[1:09:27.000 --> 1:09:32.000]  I mean, I don't have to go, but they go and it's turned out okay overall.
[1:09:32.000 --> 1:09:33.000]  I had a contested divorce.
[1:09:33.000 --> 1:09:36.000]  That's part of the system and that's what happened.
[1:09:36.000 --> 1:09:37.000]  But, I mean, here's an example.
[1:09:37.000 --> 1:09:40.000]  I walk in the psychology place yesterday at four o'clock.
[1:09:40.000 --> 1:09:45.000]  There's a family walking out of some of the other psychology offices.
[1:09:45.000 --> 1:09:46.000]  He shakes my hand.
[1:09:46.000 --> 1:09:48.000]  He's got a young daughter and a son.
[1:09:48.000 --> 1:09:49.000]  Hey, I love the show.
[1:09:49.000 --> 1:09:50.000]  Just listen to the other day.
[1:09:50.000 --> 1:09:51.000]  Love David Knight.
[1:09:51.000 --> 1:09:52.000]  Okay, thanks.
[1:09:52.000 --> 1:09:53.000]  Appreciate it.
[1:09:53.000 --> 1:09:54.000]  I go sit down.
[1:09:54.000 --> 1:09:56.000]  My daughters are inside for an hour.
[1:09:56.000 --> 1:10:02.000]  Before they're about to come out, a 15-year-old girl comes in, sits down.
[1:10:02.000 --> 1:10:04.000]  I don't say anything to her because she's unaccompanied.
[1:10:04.000 --> 1:10:10.000]  Sitting there waiting on my daughter's playing on the phone, sending texts, doing those, researching.
[1:10:10.000 --> 1:10:13.000]  And then her mom walks in and she looks at me.
[1:10:13.000 --> 1:10:14.000]  She looks at her phone.
[1:10:14.000 --> 1:10:17.000]  She goes, I'm listening to Owen Shroyer right now on this app.
[1:10:17.000 --> 1:10:19.000]  And it's something I've never seen.
[1:10:19.000 --> 1:10:20.000]  It's like a blue info or square.
[1:10:20.000 --> 1:10:21.000]  She goes, it's incredible.
[1:10:21.000 --> 1:10:23.000]  And she said, you know, all my neighbors are listening now.
[1:10:23.000 --> 1:10:24.000]  It's amazing.
[1:10:24.000 --> 1:10:27.000]  And again, I'm not bragging, folks.
[1:10:27.000 --> 1:10:29.000]  I'm just saying they know they're dead.
[1:10:29.000 --> 1:10:34.000]  And I'm not saying we're the future or we're cool or we've got red carpets.
[1:10:34.000 --> 1:10:35.000]  That's all stupid.
[1:10:35.000 --> 1:10:40.000]  The point is they are the past.
[1:10:40.000 --> 1:10:41.000]  They know they've collapsed.
[1:10:41.000 --> 1:10:43.000]  They know they're a joke.
[1:10:43.000 --> 1:10:45.000]  But let me tell you something.
[1:10:45.000 --> 1:10:48.000]  The radio executives, who are great guys in many cases, they're old line conservatives,
[1:10:48.000 --> 1:10:53.000]  a lot of them, they don't know that their grandkids are listening.
[1:10:53.000 --> 1:11:00.000]  If you're Trump or you're these folks, you know new media is bigger than mainstream media,
[1:11:00.000 --> 1:11:03.000]  but still what you read the New York Times.
[1:11:03.000 --> 1:11:05.000]  And so that still is what matters to you.
[1:11:05.000 --> 1:11:07.000]  But that's almost over, folks.
[1:11:07.000 --> 1:11:09.000]  That generation is almost gone.
[1:11:09.000 --> 1:11:10.000]  And they're great people.
[1:11:10.000 --> 1:11:13.000]  I'm not, I'm not glad to say it.
[1:11:13.000 --> 1:11:16.000]  But the statistics show what I just told you.
[1:11:16.000 --> 1:11:20.000]  And it's not just that some of my children go to one particular school.
[1:11:20.000 --> 1:11:23.000]  So they watch and listen there.
[1:11:23.000 --> 1:11:28.000]  Young people, when they see me at the mall or wherever, literally their mouths hang up and they go,
[1:11:28.000 --> 1:11:30.000]  it's the living meme.
[1:11:30.000 --> 1:11:39.000]  Trendies, old people, black folks, Hispanics, executive class Hispanics, Hispanic guys,
[1:11:39.000 --> 1:11:43.000]  you know, five guys walking through at the mall with gold chains all around their neck.
[1:11:43.000 --> 1:11:44.000]  That's Alex Jones.
[1:11:44.000 --> 1:11:45.000]  We love you so much.
[1:11:45.000 --> 1:11:46.000]  It doesn't matter.
[1:11:46.000 --> 1:11:49.000]  It's all groups because they know this is as close to reality as you're going to get.
[1:11:49.000 --> 1:11:52.000]  We're really trying to find the truth.
[1:11:52.000 --> 1:11:54.000]  That's why they call us racists all day.
[1:11:54.000 --> 1:11:56.000]  Because everybody loves us.
[1:11:56.000 --> 1:12:00.000]  People aren't stupid.
[1:12:00.000 --> 1:12:03.000]  So when I tell you all this, it's not bragging.
[1:12:03.000 --> 1:12:07.000]  It's so you understand when you're not a media person and you're alone
[1:12:07.000 --> 1:12:10.000]  and you wear a Trump shirt or an Info War shirt
[1:12:10.000 --> 1:12:13.000]  and somebody tries to throw coffee on you.
[1:12:13.000 --> 1:12:15.000]  Well, that's one out of 20 people that walk by you.
[1:12:15.000 --> 1:12:20.000]  And they're down so desperate knowing their evil control of society is over.
[1:12:20.000 --> 1:12:22.000]  They're in on the game, man.
[1:12:22.000 --> 1:12:28.000]  That's why they almost all look like goblins or trolls or are always into weird, sick stuff.
[1:12:28.000 --> 1:12:30.000]  They want to pull down civilization.
[1:12:30.000 --> 1:12:34.000]  Weinstein wants women to come in, watch him get naked, get in the shower,
[1:12:34.000 --> 1:12:37.000]  make supermodels, watch this disgusting guy.
[1:12:37.000 --> 1:12:39.000]  And then now they submit to that degradation.
[1:12:39.000 --> 1:12:41.000]  Well, now the relationship continues.
[1:12:41.000 --> 1:12:43.000]  That's how he tests you out.
[1:12:43.000 --> 1:12:48.000]  And it gets real nasty, real gross, real fast.
[1:12:48.000 --> 1:12:57.000]  That's what Hollywood is, making you watch, making your children watch Harvey Weinstein take a shower.
[1:12:57.000 --> 1:13:01.000]  It's an act of domination, an act of control.
[1:13:01.000 --> 1:13:06.000]  Lenin Maynes Johnson, this is on record and Pulitzer Prize winning books,
[1:13:06.000 --> 1:13:16.000]  would hold cabinet meetings while he took extended, incredibly stench filled dumps.
[1:13:16.000 --> 1:13:19.000]  And he did it to dominate people.
[1:13:19.000 --> 1:13:22.000]  He did it to break them.
[1:13:22.000 --> 1:13:30.000]  And that's all Hollywood is in the NFL and Kaepernick and all these super uncool people like LeBron James and Eminem all getting together.
[1:13:30.000 --> 1:13:33.000]  And, you know, the same headline everywhere, a fierce attack.
[1:13:33.000 --> 1:13:37.000]  I saw it in just headlines everywhere, a fierce attack by Eminem,
[1:13:37.000 --> 1:13:43.000]  just some pathetic corporate shill with LeBron James and the dumb zombies that still think it's cool.
[1:13:43.000 --> 1:13:51.000]  Yeah, there's still a big component of schmucks that go spend their money on that and think it's all cool.
[1:13:51.000 --> 1:13:54.000]  But it's not to young people anymore.
[1:13:54.000 --> 1:14:01.000]  They're like, Dad, I don't want to go see a Harrison Ford movie.
[1:14:01.000 --> 1:14:03.000]  You know, my dad's a cool guy, a nice guy.
[1:14:03.000 --> 1:14:07.000]  He was really excited about the new Blade Runner and he got tickets and wanted me and my son to go.
[1:14:07.000 --> 1:14:09.000]  And I said, Dad, I just I'm going to work. I don't want to go.
[1:14:09.000 --> 1:14:13.000]  And he went and picked my son up and my son said to his grandfather.
[1:14:13.000 --> 1:14:19.000]  He said, let's just go over to your house and swim in your pool with Grandma and maybe play cards or something.
[1:14:19.000 --> 1:14:23.000]  I don't want to go see a Hollywood movie.
[1:14:23.000 --> 1:14:26.000]  I didn't have to tell him that.
[1:14:26.000 --> 1:14:30.000]  He didn't want to watch.
[1:14:30.000 --> 1:14:33.000]  Hollywood.
[1:14:33.000 --> 1:14:36.000]  You don't want to be part of it.
[1:14:36.000 --> 1:14:42.000]  It's finale final by ship sailed train at the station gate got left open.
[1:14:42.000 --> 1:14:44.000]  The cows are gone.
[1:14:44.000 --> 1:14:45.000]  It's done.
[1:14:45.000 --> 1:14:49.000]  And they don't you don't think they don't know that.
[1:14:49.000 --> 1:14:51.000]  They want to sexualize your children.
[1:14:51.000 --> 1:14:53.000]  They want to brain damage them.
[1:14:53.000 --> 1:14:54.000]  They want to inject them.
[1:14:54.000 --> 1:15:01.000]  Seeing it admits a normal ingestion of the fluoride they put in the average U.S. water supply.
[1:15:01.000 --> 1:15:07.000]  1.3 parts per million lowers your child's IQ by 15 points.
[1:15:07.000 --> 1:15:13.000]  A kick in the head from a horse when they're two years old won't do that.
[1:15:13.000 --> 1:15:15.000]  And you know what?
[1:15:15.000 --> 1:15:20.000]  The average vaccine schedule they now admits is upwards of a 20 point reduction, 15 to 20.
[1:15:20.000 --> 1:15:22.000]  We're talking 30 points, folks.
[1:15:22.000 --> 1:15:25.000]  That takes you from 130 which is near genius to regular.
[1:15:25.000 --> 1:15:32.000]  If you were just going to be a regular person, that's mentally retarded.
[1:15:32.000 --> 1:15:36.000]  But you don't get a Down syndrome chromosomal manifestation.
[1:15:36.000 --> 1:15:41.000]  You get somebody who had a high powered brain, but it's so fried they've got autism.
[1:15:41.000 --> 1:15:45.000]  Which is what soldiers get hit with chemical weapons act like they got autism too.
[1:15:45.000 --> 1:15:47.000]  They sit in the corner and do this the rest of their life.
[1:15:47.000 --> 1:15:50.000]  That's what chemical weapons do.
[1:15:50.000 --> 1:15:55.000]  Comprende? You have been warned. Home call straight ahead.
[1:16:20.000 --> 1:16:26.000]  This morning mouthwash features natural oils and ancient ingredients used since Aboriginal and Biblical times.
[1:16:26.000 --> 1:16:31.000]  Instead of containing fluoride, our super blue line is loaded with the good halogen iodine
[1:16:31.000 --> 1:16:36.000]  and an array of other beneficial compounds that have been hand selected for their oral health benefits.
[1:16:36.000 --> 1:16:43.000]  Super blue fluoride free mouthwash and toothpaste are the first and only to contain all of these natural ingredients.
[1:16:43.000 --> 1:16:46.000]  Xylitol, nano silver and iodine.
[1:16:46.000 --> 1:16:50.000]  Notice the difference with our super blue fluoride free products.
[1:16:50.000 --> 1:16:55.000]  Refresh your breath and invigorate your oral health routine at infowarstore.com.
[1:16:55.000 --> 1:17:22.000]  At infowarstore.com.
[1:17:22.000 --> 1:17:27.000]  Patrick Henry warned us the liberties of a people never were nor ever will be secure
[1:17:27.000 --> 1:17:31.000]  when the transactions of their rulers may be concealed from them.
[1:17:31.000 --> 1:17:35.000]  Today everything the government does at every level is concealed from us.
[1:17:35.000 --> 1:17:40.000]  We have trade deals to manage our economy that not even our elected representatives are allowed to see.
[1:17:40.000 --> 1:17:44.000]  Later in life Patrick Henry looked back and said when the American spirit was in its youth,
[1:17:44.000 --> 1:17:48.000]  the language of America was different. Liberty, sir, was the primary object.
[1:17:48.000 --> 1:17:54.000]  Today our primary concern is safety and comfort when we should be demanding liberty.
[1:17:54.000 --> 1:18:22.000]  At infowarstore.com I'm David Knight.
[1:18:22.000 --> 1:18:27.000]  Thank you so much for joining us today.
[1:18:52.000 --> 1:18:54.000]  Thank you doctor group from the Global Healing Center.
[1:18:54.000 --> 1:19:23.000]  Thank you so much for all your work sir on this great product.
[1:19:24.000 --> 1:19:46.000]  Thank you so much for joining us today.
[1:19:46.000 --> 1:20:08.000]  And that's what I call the miracle of food preservation.
[1:20:08.000 --> 1:20:28.000]  From the front lines of the information war it's Alex Jones.
[1:20:28.000 --> 1:20:35.000]  Notice you don't hear stuff like this in Hollywood movies anymore because Hollywood's been dead for a long time.
[1:20:35.000 --> 1:20:41.000]  You'll see Hollywood wanted to drag the rest of the world with it.
[1:20:41.000 --> 1:20:44.000]  And they've been rejected all over the planet.
[1:20:44.000 --> 1:20:50.000]  So over the last 10 years they've been bankrupt and the communist Chinese have been bankrupting them.
[1:20:50.000 --> 1:20:52.000]  That didn't save them either.
[1:20:52.000 --> 1:20:56.000]  Now it's accelerated their collapse.
[1:20:56.000 --> 1:21:04.000]  And I don't vengefully take pleasure in watching this group of pedophiles start to really accelerate their journey to hell.
[1:21:04.000 --> 1:21:12.000]  I take pleasure to breathe in air and feel a little bit less weight on my soul.
[1:21:12.000 --> 1:21:13.000]  We're close.
[1:21:13.000 --> 1:21:15.000]  It's going to be rough though.
[1:21:15.000 --> 1:21:17.000]  We've turned the tide.
[1:21:17.000 --> 1:21:18.000]  Make no mistake.
[1:21:18.000 --> 1:21:20.000]  Praise God for that.
[1:21:20.000 --> 1:21:27.000]  And thank his son Jesus Christ for what he did on the cross because these enemies hate it because they know how real it is.
[1:21:27.000 --> 1:21:30.000]  It has spiritual power over them.
[1:21:30.000 --> 1:21:32.000]  It binds them and they know it.
[1:21:32.000 --> 1:21:36.000]  It's the trump card.
[1:21:36.000 --> 1:21:45.000]  I'm going to go to your phone calls and then as I said a little bit earlier, it is absolutely admitted now.
[1:21:45.000 --> 1:21:52.000]  And they're trying to walk it back and they don't know how to kind of let it out and notice.
[1:21:52.000 --> 1:21:55.000]  Just a week ago it was the biggest story in the world.
[1:21:55.000 --> 1:21:56.000]  We're going to get your guns.
[1:21:56.000 --> 1:21:58.000]  The second amendment to blame.
[1:21:58.000 --> 1:22:00.000]  Christians are to blame.
[1:22:00.000 --> 1:22:02.000]  White people are inherently evil.
[1:22:02.000 --> 1:22:05.000]  It's always weird white people saying it.
[1:22:05.000 --> 1:22:14.000]  I don't like quoting the people saying it without pointing out most of them are white because it makes it sound like folks that aren't white are the ones saying it and then it creates division.
[1:22:14.000 --> 1:22:22.000]  No, it's 95% of it white people trying to get a race war going because they're the crooks up there running things and they know we're waking up.
[1:22:22.000 --> 1:22:23.000]  They want to see each other's throats.
[1:22:23.000 --> 1:22:26.000]  I mean, this is ridiculously obvious.
[1:22:26.000 --> 1:22:30.000]  We're so close.
[1:22:30.000 --> 1:22:32.000]  But it's epic.
[1:22:32.000 --> 1:22:41.000]  They started coming out two days ago going, okay, maybe ISIS was involved in the Associated Press in Reuters and then in Newsweek yesterday.
[1:22:41.000 --> 1:22:50.000]  And they went, okay, looks like there is Islamic connections and well, there is a cover up and the timelines changing and other people were shot.
[1:22:50.000 --> 1:22:52.000]  We hadn't told you about it.
[1:22:52.000 --> 1:22:57.000]  Turns out the whole timeline is not right and hey, listen.
[1:22:57.000 --> 1:23:00.000]  Now the cops from day one have been leaking this.
[1:23:00.000 --> 1:23:01.000]  Okay.
[1:23:01.000 --> 1:23:11.000]  And listen, you think I want to be the one that had the hostage rescue team connection to always be up front to take the danger of that and not set it to act cool folks.
[1:23:11.000 --> 1:23:14.000]  It's dangerous doing this.
[1:23:14.000 --> 1:23:18.000]  It's dangerous people that gave it to us.
[1:23:18.000 --> 1:23:22.000]  They said, there's Islamic stuff all over the room, there's anti-fascist stuff, trips to the Middle East.
[1:23:22.000 --> 1:23:25.000]  It all came out a week later.
[1:23:25.000 --> 1:23:27.000]  What's in the news now?
[1:23:27.000 --> 1:23:31.000]  And I'm going to your calls.
[1:23:31.000 --> 1:23:34.000]  Adon Salazar, this story should go around the world.
[1:23:34.000 --> 1:23:36.000]  It's on newswars.com.
[1:23:36.000 --> 1:23:37.000]  It's on infowars.com.
[1:23:37.000 --> 1:23:45.000]  But what's crazy is it's linked here to mainstream news.
[1:23:45.000 --> 1:23:48.000]  In fact, print me that first link out of Adon's article, please.
[1:23:48.000 --> 1:23:50.000]  I want to have that show folks as well.
[1:23:50.000 --> 1:23:56.000]  Because if I don't, the media is so deceptive they'll go, look, Jones put out fake news that the person had said this when they actually said it.
[1:23:56.000 --> 1:23:59.000]  So I want to show the source of that.
[1:23:59.000 --> 1:24:08.000]  Mandalay Bay owner, what's being expressed by police may not be accurate.
[1:24:08.000 --> 1:24:18.000]  That's out of Fox in Las Vegas, Nevada, and the Associated Press.
[1:24:18.000 --> 1:24:19.000]  There it is.
[1:24:19.000 --> 1:24:22.000]  Hotel questions do timeline of Vegas shooting.
[1:24:22.000 --> 1:24:25.000]  I'll say it again, as I said, last Friday.
[1:24:25.000 --> 1:24:31.000]  The cover-up has collapsed.
[1:24:31.000 --> 1:24:33.000]  We know there were multiple shooters.
[1:24:33.000 --> 1:24:36.000]  We know more people were shot at other locations than they've said.
[1:24:36.000 --> 1:24:41.000]  We know there's an Islamic connection, and we've even got it from the White House.
[1:24:41.000 --> 1:24:46.000]  And by the way, I had it from the White House before the Republican operative came out.
[1:24:46.000 --> 1:24:53.000]  I just don't want to blow our sources.
[1:24:53.000 --> 1:24:59.000]  And there's not many left.
[1:24:59.000 --> 1:25:01.000]  So that's why.
[1:25:01.000 --> 1:25:02.000]  But they know.
[1:25:02.000 --> 1:25:03.000]  I know they know.
[1:25:03.000 --> 1:25:08.000]  So what's the point of hiding your line under a bushel?
[1:25:08.000 --> 1:25:09.000]  So here it is.
[1:25:09.000 --> 1:25:11.000]  Associated Press.
[1:25:11.000 --> 1:25:13.000]  Mandalay Bay owner.
[1:25:13.000 --> 1:25:15.000]  What's being expressed by police may not be accurate.
[1:25:15.000 --> 1:25:20.000]  We cannot be certain about the most recent timeline that has been communicated publicly.
[1:25:20.000 --> 1:25:21.000]  I'm certain.
[1:25:21.000 --> 1:25:23.000]  Think so.
[1:25:23.000 --> 1:25:30.000]  You got hotels a mile away with glass and bullet cases everywhere in police shooting other men and shootouts in other parts of the city.
[1:25:30.000 --> 1:25:32.000]  All over police scanners.
[1:25:32.000 --> 1:25:33.000]  It wasn't fog in the war.
[1:25:33.000 --> 1:25:35.000]  It was cops reporting shots fired.
[1:25:35.000 --> 1:25:36.000]  People shooting here.
[1:25:36.000 --> 1:25:37.000]  People shooting there.
[1:25:37.000 --> 1:25:38.000]  They weren't paying it.
[1:25:38.000 --> 1:25:41.000]  The cab driver's like, well, that's far away.
[1:25:41.000 --> 1:25:43.000]  And then she's at Mandalay.
[1:25:43.000 --> 1:25:44.000]  Right above her.
[1:25:44.000 --> 1:25:45.000]  Seconds later, the guns go off.
[1:25:45.000 --> 1:25:47.000]  It's not an echo.
[1:25:47.000 --> 1:25:50.000]  Anybody that's shot firearms knows that.
[1:25:50.000 --> 1:25:53.000]  Other people shoot full auto out in the countryside, mile away.
[1:25:53.000 --> 1:25:56.000]  Sounds just like that.
[1:25:56.000 --> 1:26:00.000]  And then bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, right on top of her.
[1:26:00.000 --> 1:26:03.000]  She's sitting in the same spot.
[1:26:03.000 --> 1:26:06.000]  But I already had the sources.
[1:26:06.000 --> 1:26:11.000]  We already had all the info we already know.
[1:26:11.000 --> 1:26:13.000]  There's a giant cover up.
[1:26:13.000 --> 1:26:16.000]  There was a giant terror attack.
[1:26:16.000 --> 1:26:18.000]  Part of it got stopped.
[1:26:18.000 --> 1:26:21.000]  A bunch of it didn't.
[1:26:21.000 --> 1:26:26.000]  And they don't want to tell America that ISIS attacked a major setting.
[1:26:26.000 --> 1:26:33.000]  The argument is, from the White House sources, is they've told the president, sir, if you do that,
[1:26:33.000 --> 1:26:35.000]  it will trigger the other mass attacks.
[1:26:35.000 --> 1:26:38.000]  And see, you can tell what the intel operas at the top are globalist.
[1:26:38.000 --> 1:26:40.000]  When all hell breaks loose, as I said months ago,
[1:26:40.000 --> 1:26:44.000]  they're going to use the ISIS attack as the cover for the Antifa and others
[1:26:44.000 --> 1:26:48.000]  and then more professional teams after that to target folks politically
[1:26:48.000 --> 1:26:53.000]  and say, oh, it's just ISIS.
[1:26:53.000 --> 1:27:01.000]  So the next time they really launched the attack and it's 500 targets in one hour,
[1:27:01.000 --> 1:27:08.000]  no one's going to notice in all the hubbub certain political leaders getting attacked and taken out as well.
[1:27:08.000 --> 1:27:11.000]  They already tried and even the Washington Times had an in-depth investigation
[1:27:11.000 --> 1:27:16.000]  that law enforcement believes that was a target to take out 15 members of Congress to trigger a special election.
[1:27:16.000 --> 1:27:21.000]  That was a setup by another Dennis Hastert lookalike.
[1:27:21.000 --> 1:27:24.000]  It's like an army of these guys.
[1:27:24.000 --> 1:27:26.000]  When you read criminology, they don't know why.
[1:27:26.000 --> 1:27:32.000]  It's just, it's weird how certain criminal types look certain ways.
[1:27:32.000 --> 1:27:36.000]  It's just, it's bizarre.
[1:27:36.000 --> 1:27:41.000]  Now, ladies and gentlemen, I don't know all of it, okay?
[1:27:41.000 --> 1:27:43.000]  Because the enemy's got different plans as well.
[1:27:43.000 --> 1:27:49.000]  But they got a bunch of stuff cooking right now and I'm telling you,
[1:27:49.000 --> 1:27:54.000]  this month and coming into November 4th, you're going to see stuff happen
[1:27:54.000 --> 1:27:57.000]  if we don't derail this and stop it by exposing it.
[1:27:57.000 --> 1:28:03.000]  That's going to make man delay and that event look like child's play.
[1:28:03.000 --> 1:28:06.000]  And don't say you haven't been born.
[1:28:06.000 --> 1:28:12.000]  And let me tell you something.
[1:28:12.000 --> 1:28:17.000]  Listeners, if you're awake working the night shift and there's a mass shooting,
[1:28:17.000 --> 1:28:19.000]  call your whole family and say get up.
[1:28:19.000 --> 1:28:24.000]  Because when the big one comes and they attack a bunch of targets,
[1:28:24.000 --> 1:28:28.000]  we need people up during the night understanding and videotaping
[1:28:28.000 --> 1:28:31.000]  and exposing what's happening and reporting on it ahead of the morning.
[1:28:31.000 --> 1:28:34.000]  Because they're going to want a lot of time to get their narrative straight.
[1:28:34.000 --> 1:28:38.000]  So I think they target during shift change, 10 p.m. to midnight,
[1:28:38.000 --> 1:28:42.000]  where most forces are having shift changes in much of the country,
[1:28:42.000 --> 1:28:45.000]  the East Coast, Central Areas and Mountain.
[1:28:45.000 --> 1:28:47.000]  I think they've already got the West Coast.
[1:28:47.000 --> 1:28:51.000]  And just a lot of stuff goes into that computation, prime analysis.
[1:28:51.000 --> 1:28:56.000]  We'll be back with your follow-up, I promise.
[1:28:56.000 --> 1:28:59.000]  You know, someone very profoundly once said many years ago
[1:28:59.000 --> 1:29:03.000]  that if fascism ever comes to America, it'll come in the name of liberalism.
[1:29:03.000 --> 1:29:06.000]  You're a white man!
[1:29:06.000 --> 1:29:15.000]  Welcome to The War Room, the latest expansion in InfoWars live broadcasting.
[1:29:15.000 --> 1:29:20.000]  We are live weekdays from 3 to 6 p.m. Central at infowars.com.

[1:29:34.000 --> 1:29:39.000]  Will he be hearing from Alex Jones regularly, as well as taking your phone calls?
[1:29:39.000 --> 1:29:43.000]  The liberal establishment media has controlled the narrative for too long.
[1:29:43.000 --> 1:29:46.000]  The silent majority is no longer silent.
[1:29:46.000 --> 1:30:05.000]  This is The War Room.
[1:30:16.000 --> 1:30:21.000]  Super high quality nascent iodine is an essential mineral sourced of 99.99%
[1:30:21.000 --> 1:30:24.000]  ultra-pure deep earth iodine crystals.
[1:30:24.000 --> 1:30:28.000]  This essential mineral is necessary in order to produce thyroid hormones
[1:30:28.000 --> 1:30:32.000]  which influence every cell, tissue and organ in the body.
[1:30:32.000 --> 1:30:36.000]  With inadequate thyroid hormones, you may experience slow metabolism,
[1:30:36.000 --> 1:30:39.000]  lethargy, weight gain and overall brain fog.
[1:30:39.000 --> 1:30:45.000]  Survival Shield X2 and BioTrue Selenium work together to support the systems in your body.

[1:31:27.000 --> 1:31:31.000]  The elite are masters at poisoning our environment while themselves doing things
[1:31:31.000 --> 1:31:35.000]  that mitigate or avoid most toxic effects for themselves.
[1:31:35.000 --> 1:31:37.000]  The general public doesn't.
[1:31:37.000 --> 1:31:41.000]  The Alexa Pure Breeze will be a steal at $300, $400, $500.
[1:31:41.000 --> 1:31:45.000]  One of these systems can keep 800 square feet incredibly clean.
[1:31:45.000 --> 1:31:49.000]  This is a system I'm personally putting in throughout my house replacing older,
[1:31:49.000 --> 1:31:52.000]  more expensive filters that didn't do as good a job.
[1:31:52.000 --> 1:31:58.000]  Find out why this system is so revolutionary today at InfowarsStore.com.
[1:31:58.000 --> 1:32:03.000]  As most of you already know, I am a voracious consumer of news and information.
[1:32:03.000 --> 1:32:06.000]  And in the last four or five years doing more and more research,
[1:32:06.000 --> 1:32:11.000]  I came across the fact that the elite establishment is fully aware of the fact
[1:32:11.000 --> 1:32:16.000]  that our ancient ancestors, in many cases, had much better nutrition than we do today.
[1:32:16.000 --> 1:32:20.000]  And our ancient ancestors sought out the bones of the animals
[1:32:20.000 --> 1:32:22.000]  that they were hunting, killing, and then processing.
[1:32:22.000 --> 1:32:25.000]  And so I set out to develop Caveman,
[1:32:25.000 --> 1:32:28.000]  but to not just have concentrated bone broth from chicken,
[1:32:28.000 --> 1:32:33.000]  but seven other superfood ingredients known for cleansing
[1:32:33.000 --> 1:32:36.000]  and supercharging the body at the same time.
[1:32:36.000 --> 1:32:39.000]  Infowars isn't just fighting the globalist.
[1:32:39.000 --> 1:32:44.000]  We're expanding results and we're expanding in the face of the complete media assault
[1:32:44.000 --> 1:32:47.000]  and winning because of your support.
[1:32:47.000 --> 1:32:50.000]  Caveman is back in stock. People absolutely love it.
[1:32:50.000 --> 1:32:54.000]  So please secure your Caveman today at InfowarsLife.com
[1:32:54.000 --> 1:33:23.000]  until free, AAA-2533139.
[1:33:24.000 --> 1:33:47.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, I am Alex Jones, your host.
[1:33:47.000 --> 1:33:51.000]  We are broadcasting worldwide.
[1:33:51.000 --> 1:33:54.000]  We're trying to escape from the prison planet.
[1:33:54.000 --> 1:33:55.000]  We only got one.
[1:33:55.000 --> 1:33:57.000]  We're trying to stop the planet from being turned into a giant,
[1:33:57.000 --> 1:34:01.000]  panopticonic, technotronic, technocracy control grid.
[1:34:01.000 --> 1:34:05.000]  And by the way, that's the globalist own words and own plan
[1:34:05.000 --> 1:34:11.000]  to turn this into a veritable prison planet
[1:34:11.000 --> 1:34:19.000]  with a permanent superclass run by a bunch of bloodthirsty, pedophile, sociopath, psychopath, globalist.
[1:34:19.000 --> 1:34:24.000]  It's up to us that want a future of every race, color, creed, religion, ethnicity
[1:34:24.000 --> 1:34:25.000]  that want freedom.
[1:34:25.000 --> 1:34:30.000]  And I do believe there's good people in every group to stand together for freedom.
[1:34:30.000 --> 1:34:32.000]  All right, I said I'm taking calls today.
[1:34:32.000 --> 1:34:35.000]  We're going to take a lot of them throughout the broadcast.
[1:34:35.000 --> 1:34:39.000]  But I want to play one more little piece here before we do.
[1:34:39.000 --> 1:34:47.000]  When you listen to the audio of Mr. Weinstein trying to get a woman to come into a room
[1:34:47.000 --> 1:34:54.000]  where he's going to disrobe and take a shower in front of her, it's all about degradation.
[1:34:54.000 --> 1:34:57.000]  It's all about humiliation.
[1:34:57.000 --> 1:35:02.000]  It's all about them force feeding us their culture.
[1:35:02.000 --> 1:35:07.000]  When they want to sexualize your children with Hollywood and some to Redstone's Nickelodeon,
[1:35:07.000 --> 1:35:14.000]  and when they want the Hollywood run, sex education of five-year-olds to confuse their sexuality
[1:35:14.000 --> 1:35:22.000]  and do things that even Camille Paglia calls child abuse, it is a manifestation of their
[1:35:22.000 --> 1:35:25.000]  creepy pervertedness.
[1:35:25.000 --> 1:35:30.000]  They want to control and run your life like MSNBC says in their promos.
[1:35:30.000 --> 1:35:32.000]  Your kids don't belong to you.
[1:35:32.000 --> 1:35:33.000]  They belong to the state.
[1:35:33.000 --> 1:35:37.000]  They want to say outrageous things to break your will.
[1:35:37.000 --> 1:35:42.000]  We've got all these Oscar announcements that you name it with them making jokes about Weinstein
[1:35:42.000 --> 1:35:45.000]  for a decade plus.
[1:35:45.000 --> 1:35:47.000]  That story is up on infowars.com.
[1:35:47.000 --> 1:35:51.000]  Oscar attendees once laughed at Weinstein being a sexual predator.
[1:35:51.000 --> 1:35:57.000]  But it's not a joke and you've got Clooney and Matt Damon and you've got all the Ben Affleck
[1:35:57.000 --> 1:36:05.000]  usual suspects helping cover it up, coming out and defending him and saying he didn't do this
[1:36:05.000 --> 1:36:12.000]  when they all knew while they posed as these big pro-women advocates.
[1:36:12.000 --> 1:36:18.000]  They're the scum of the earth, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:36:18.000 --> 1:36:20.000]  And Hollywood is collapsing.
[1:36:20.000 --> 1:36:22.000]  It doesn't have any power anymore.
[1:36:22.000 --> 1:36:24.000]  So yeah, there's a lot of people that played along.
[1:36:24.000 --> 1:36:27.000]  A lot of these women are just as guilty of the same type of stuff.
[1:36:27.000 --> 1:36:28.000]  Meryl Streep.
[1:36:28.000 --> 1:36:31.000]  She defends child rapist Roman Polanski.
[1:36:31.000 --> 1:36:37.000]  Just recently said he should be let out of jail over in Europe and says that he's a good guy
[1:36:37.000 --> 1:36:44.000]  and does standing ovations for a guy that kidnapped and raped a 13-year-old girl.
[1:36:44.000 --> 1:36:48.000]  But suddenly, oh, she's against Weinstein because the power's gone.
[1:36:48.000 --> 1:36:50.000]  Yeah, Hollywood's been dead a while.
[1:36:50.000 --> 1:36:54.000]  We're going to go to Randall that wants to talk about that in a moment.
[1:36:54.000 --> 1:36:57.000]  But their attempt to kill the rest of the country in the world is failing.
[1:36:57.000 --> 1:36:59.000]  That's what's important.
[1:36:59.000 --> 1:37:04.000]  We've been the prodigal son pulling away from these scam artists.
[1:37:04.000 --> 1:37:06.000]  This is a good day, my friends.
[1:37:06.000 --> 1:37:08.000]  It's all dying at a faster rate.
[1:37:08.000 --> 1:37:12.000]  The NFL, mainstream television, the entire Hollywood devil works for pedophile cult.
[1:37:12.000 --> 1:37:15.000]  Everyone addresses them as the pedophile cult.
[1:37:15.000 --> 1:37:20.000]  It's over devastation, victory against their forces.
[1:37:20.000 --> 1:37:24.000]  Now, they're striking back in other ways through the fluoride, through the vaccines,
[1:37:24.000 --> 1:37:25.000]  through their soft kill.
[1:37:25.000 --> 1:37:28.000]  They want to hurt children for their god.
[1:37:28.000 --> 1:37:30.000]  They want to hurt innocent women.
[1:37:30.000 --> 1:37:32.000]  And here it is.
[1:37:32.000 --> 1:37:33.000]  Don't do it, James.
[1:37:33.000 --> 1:37:35.000]  You don't want to miss what we had out.
[1:37:35.000 --> 1:37:36.000]  Oh, please.
[1:37:36.000 --> 1:37:38.000]  I'm not afraid of anyone in show business.
[1:37:38.000 --> 1:37:43.000]  I turned down intercourse with Harvey Weinstein on no less than three occasions at five.
[1:37:52.000 --> 1:37:54.000]  What do we have to do here?
[1:37:54.000 --> 1:37:55.000]  Nothing.
[1:37:55.000 --> 1:37:57.000]  I'm going to take a shower and sit there and have a drink.
[1:37:57.000 --> 1:37:58.000]  What?
[1:37:58.000 --> 1:37:59.000]  I'm going to drink.
[1:37:59.000 --> 1:38:00.000]  Can I stay on the bar?
[1:38:00.000 --> 1:38:01.000]  No.
[1:38:01.000 --> 1:38:02.000]  You must come here now.
[1:38:02.000 --> 1:38:03.000]  No.
[1:38:03.000 --> 1:38:04.000]  Please.
[1:38:04.000 --> 1:38:05.000]  I don't want to.
[1:38:05.000 --> 1:38:06.000]  I'm not doing anything.
[1:38:06.000 --> 1:38:07.000]  You have to come here.
[1:38:07.000 --> 1:38:08.000]  I'm sorry.
[1:38:08.000 --> 1:38:09.000]  I cannot.
[1:38:09.000 --> 1:38:11.000]  No, yesterday was a kind of aggressive way.
[1:38:11.000 --> 1:38:13.000]  I don't feel comfortable.
[1:38:13.000 --> 1:38:15.000]  I mean, don't have a fight with me on the phone.
[1:38:15.000 --> 1:38:16.000]  It's not nice.
[1:38:16.000 --> 1:38:17.000]  Please.
[1:38:17.000 --> 1:38:18.000]  I'm not going to do anything.
[1:38:18.000 --> 1:38:19.000]  I swear at my children.
[1:38:19.000 --> 1:38:20.000]  Please come in.
[1:38:20.000 --> 1:38:21.000]  I'm a famous guy.
[1:38:21.000 --> 1:38:23.000]  I'm feeling very comfortable right now.
[1:38:23.000 --> 1:38:24.000]  Please come in now.
[1:38:24.000 --> 1:38:25.000]  In one minute.
[1:38:25.000 --> 1:38:27.000]  If you want to leave when the guy comes with my jacket.
[1:38:27.000 --> 1:38:28.000]  Why yesterday?
[1:38:28.000 --> 1:38:29.000]  You touched my wrist.
[1:38:29.000 --> 1:38:30.000]  Please.
[1:38:30.000 --> 1:38:31.000]  I'm sorry.
[1:38:31.000 --> 1:38:32.000]  Just come on.
[1:38:32.000 --> 1:38:33.000]  I'm used to that.
[1:38:33.000 --> 1:38:34.000]  Are you used to that?
[1:38:34.000 --> 1:38:35.000]  Yes.
[1:38:35.000 --> 1:38:36.000]  Come in.
[1:38:36.000 --> 1:38:37.000]  No, but I'm not used to that.
[1:38:37.000 --> 1:38:38.000]  I won't do it again.
[1:38:38.000 --> 1:38:39.000]  Come on.
[1:38:39.000 --> 1:38:40.000]  See you.
[1:38:40.000 --> 1:38:49.000]  I'm going to start by thanking Harvey Weinstein for organizing this amazing day.
[1:38:49.000 --> 1:38:56.000]  Harvey.
[1:38:56.000 --> 1:38:58.000]  This is possible because of Harvey.
[1:38:58.000 --> 1:39:04.000]  He is a wonderful human being, a good friend, and just a powerhouse.
[1:39:04.000 --> 1:39:13.000]  I just want to thank God, Harvey Weinstein.
[1:39:13.000 --> 1:39:18.000]  The Punisher, Old Testament, I guess.
[1:39:18.000 --> 1:39:22.000]  And I just want to congratulate Harvey and his wife, Regina, on the birth of their new
[1:39:22.000 --> 1:39:23.000]  baby boy.
[1:39:23.000 --> 1:39:24.000]  Fairly seconded.
[1:39:24.000 --> 1:39:28.000]  Harvey gave us just what we needed, another him.
[1:39:28.000 --> 1:39:32.000]  He got you a wedge tart, a tartam didn't he?
[1:39:32.000 --> 1:39:39.000]  If he's anything like his dad, he's going to be relentless, passionate.
[1:39:39.000 --> 1:39:45.000]  You can stop kissing up to me for forgetting to thank me at the Oscars.
[1:39:45.000 --> 1:39:51.000]  Let's just do what we're here to do.
[1:39:51.000 --> 1:39:53.000]  Are we asking for it?
[1:39:53.000 --> 1:39:58.000]  You know, by presenting all the sensuality and all the sexuality?
[1:39:58.000 --> 1:40:04.000]  The 2012 nominee is for best performance by an actress in a supporting role.
[1:40:04.000 --> 1:40:12.000]  Congratulations, you five ladies no longer have to pretend to be attracted to Harvey Weinstein.
[1:40:12.000 --> 1:40:22.000]  Did you know you didn't mean at the time, I mean I guess it's not a secret?
[1:40:22.000 --> 1:40:25.000]  No, I did, later on.
[1:40:25.000 --> 1:40:29.000]  I don't think it's only Harvey Weinstein.
[1:40:29.000 --> 1:40:31.000]  I don't think we're only looking at him.
[1:40:31.000 --> 1:40:36.000]  I think we're looking at a world much deeper than that.
[1:40:36.000 --> 1:40:39.000]  And that's a threat you bring him down, we'll bring you all down.
[1:40:39.000 --> 1:40:45.000]  The whole sickening empire has already collapsed, Babylon has fallen, at least that corner of the command post has.
[1:40:45.000 --> 1:40:48.000]  The pedophilia, it's all coming out.
[1:40:48.000 --> 1:41:04.000]  Let me just tell folks right now that I have financed multiple teams, high level connections internationally, law enforcement you name it, that are on the trails of all these people.
[1:41:04.000 --> 1:41:12.000]  And they already know that, and they also know that people like Eric Prince is on their tail.
[1:41:12.000 --> 1:41:17.000]  The same Hollywood that's attacked and demonized him, most of it is not true.
[1:41:17.000 --> 1:41:27.000]  But it's not just people like Eric Prince or myself that are helping expose the pedophile ranks, it's you.
[1:41:27.000 --> 1:41:30.000]  And they will fall.
[1:41:30.000 --> 1:41:43.000]  A big reason this is coming out is the media hopes that they can just make it about men oppressing women.
[1:41:43.000 --> 1:41:53.000]  And believe me, they got women in Hollywood procuring women, and they've got whole systems of women dominating women.
[1:41:53.000 --> 1:41:59.000]  And the fact that this is breaking out in Hollywood like this just shows the weakness of their entire system.
[1:41:59.000 --> 1:42:08.000]  But it will take down the Clintons who aren't just rapists and don't just defend rapists and don't just support rapists.
[1:42:08.000 --> 1:42:17.000]  But they fly around on Lolita Express all over the world on an aircraft with kidnapped children.
[1:42:17.000 --> 1:42:19.000]  And what do they do as that comes out?
[1:42:19.000 --> 1:42:27.000]  Well, they make it about a pizza place, get everybody to cover it, then say we created the story about the pizza place when CNN did.
[1:42:27.000 --> 1:42:30.000]  Say we said things about the pizza place we didn't say.
[1:42:30.000 --> 1:42:33.000]  Have us clarify it and then say pedophilia doesn't exist.
[1:42:33.000 --> 1:42:38.000]  Really, the deputy pope just got arrested for reportedly kidnapping over a hundred little boys.
[1:42:38.000 --> 1:42:43.000]  You gonna tell us about Pizza Gate on that when you old demons? Good luck.
[1:42:43.000 --> 1:42:46.000]  None of your PR campaigns went anywhere.
[1:42:46.000 --> 1:42:50.000]  They blew up in your big old fat New World Order faces.
[1:42:50.000 --> 1:42:56.000]  I promise the minute we come out of this break, I'm going to write to Randall and others that are holding stay with us.

[1:44:58.000 --> 1:45:02.000]  Thousands of years ago, there was a basic form of chivalry.
[1:45:02.000 --> 1:45:10.000]  Our ancestors would hear the drums of war, giving the warriors of the tribe a chance to organize and prepare a defense.
[1:45:10.000 --> 1:45:19.000]  Sixty years ago, when foreign air forces were approaching filled with bombs, they had drums of their own, air raid sirens.
[1:45:19.000 --> 1:45:23.000]  But in the 21st century, there are silent weapons for quiet war.
[1:45:23.000 --> 1:45:29.000]  Pathogens added to the food and water, into the lining of plastics that destroy our vitality.
[1:45:29.000 --> 1:45:33.000]  Turn off our hormones and accelerate our journey towards death.
[1:45:33.000 --> 1:45:41.000]  I personally counter this onslaught with Anthroplex. Anthroplex is designed with known organic concentrated herbs
[1:45:41.000 --> 1:45:47.000]  to create the basic foundation to normal metabolic activity inside the human body.

[1:47:24.000 --> 1:47:26.000]  Kenny Josh and others.
[1:47:26.000 --> 1:47:29.000]  Randall in Florida says Hollywood's been dead for a while.
[1:47:29.000 --> 1:47:31.000]  Again, I agree with that.
[1:47:31.000 --> 1:47:35.000]  But now it's officially becoming dead. The whole Combine, the NFL, all of it.
[1:47:35.000 --> 1:47:38.000]  Go ahead, Randall. Thanks for holding.
[1:47:38.000 --> 1:47:39.000]  Thank you so much, Alex.
[1:47:39.000 --> 1:47:43.000]  Before I do that, I just want to say, first time I ever saw you was years ago.
[1:47:43.000 --> 1:47:49.000]  You came to the Orlando High Live and gave a live, I believe it was a Sunday broadcast.
[1:47:49.000 --> 1:47:53.000]  That's actually what woke me up to everything that's going on.
[1:47:53.000 --> 1:47:55.000]  So I want to thank you for that off the bat.
[1:47:55.000 --> 1:48:00.000]  I remember that. That was a capacity crowd by the local station where we were number one,
[1:48:00.000 --> 1:48:05.000]  beat Rush Limbaugh there in Orlando, then they took us off the station, which was okay,
[1:48:05.000 --> 1:48:09.000]  and made it all sports because they came and basically bought them out to get me off the air.
[1:48:09.000 --> 1:48:13.000]  But that was a good speech we gave. Thanks for being there.
[1:48:13.000 --> 1:48:15.000]  It was a pleasure to be in there.
[1:48:15.000 --> 1:48:20.000]  I think Hollywood's been dead for a while. I looked at it like a grenade that somebody's pulled the pen
[1:48:20.000 --> 1:48:25.000]  and tossed it into the middle of California and we're just waiting for it to explode.
[1:48:25.000 --> 1:48:30.000]  They really have nobody to blame but themselves because what's happened is that they've got rid of
[1:48:30.000 --> 1:48:38.000]  any sort of identifiable conservative actor, actresses, comedian from Tim Allen to Sam Elliott
[1:48:38.000 --> 1:48:41.000]  to Randy Quaid to Rick Moranis.
[1:48:41.000 --> 1:48:46.000]  What's actually funny about Rick Moranis is I believe years ago, because he was a big-time actor
[1:48:46.000 --> 1:48:51.000]  in the 80s and early 90s and he all of a sudden stopped acting.
[1:48:51.000 --> 1:48:57.000]  And the story was that he was tired of Disney and Nickelodeon, as you pointed out,
[1:48:57.000 --> 1:49:02.000]  starting to sexualize children. So he stopped acting and started teaching
[1:49:02.000 --> 1:49:08.000]  at a non-liberal pro-conservative university where I believe he still teaches to this day.
[1:49:08.000 --> 1:49:15.000]  That's right. It's all about the sexualization of children, the targeting, the destruction of beauty, of innocence.
[1:49:15.000 --> 1:49:21.000]  And that's what all these guys are into and there's just such a soulless feeling there.
[1:49:21.000 --> 1:49:26.000]  And you said the most astute thing I've heard in weeks, when you liken them to a hand grenade.
[1:49:26.000 --> 1:49:33.000]  When they sent Megan Kelly out and the mainstream media built her up as a goddess, that was killing her.
[1:49:33.000 --> 1:49:39.000]  But they sent her out like a hand grenade they threw to blow up to destroy me and Trump and others.
[1:49:39.000 --> 1:49:43.000]  And it's the same thing. These corporate execs know they're on the run.
[1:49:43.000 --> 1:49:52.000]  They just keep trying to find mercenaries that will go out and do these heinous things
[1:49:52.000 --> 1:49:56.000]  and lie like this to carry it out. But it's just nothing works anymore.
[1:49:56.000 --> 1:50:00.000]  God bless you, Randall. It was good, I guess, to meet you out there in Florida.
[1:50:00.000 --> 1:50:07.000]  That was the old days. I drove the family bus out there with my children and my ex-wife.
[1:50:07.000 --> 1:50:11.000]  I remember when I was able to travel more. It was great to meet folks.
[1:50:11.000 --> 1:50:16.000]  Let's go ahead and go to another caller. Philip, in California, you're on the air. Thanks for holding.
[1:50:16.000 --> 1:50:18.000]  Hey, no problem. How are you doing, Alex?
[1:50:18.000 --> 1:50:20.000]  Good, my friend. Go ahead.
[1:50:20.000 --> 1:50:27.000]  Well, I was just going to call in and just the state of affairs, everything that's going on in the world right now.
[1:50:27.000 --> 1:50:32.000]  I'm born again Christian. I believe everywhere the Bible and it is a spiritual warfare.
[1:50:32.000 --> 1:50:38.000]  Fusion 610, quite clearly states it's between entities above us.
[1:50:38.000 --> 1:50:44.000]  And it's all playing out on the stage. I do believe end times are imminent.
[1:50:44.000 --> 1:50:49.000]  I just really want to comment on that. That's the state of affairs at the minute.
[1:50:49.000 --> 1:50:52.000]  I agree. I noticed you said you wanted to talk about the Vegas shooting.
[1:50:52.000 --> 1:50:57.000]  It's incredible that now they admit the official story isn't true and won't say what happened.
[1:50:57.000 --> 1:51:02.000]  Notice it's leaving the news now as what we first reported is accurate.
[1:51:02.000 --> 1:51:08.000]  Absolutely, no. From day one, I follow your show for probably last year and a half or so.
[1:51:08.000 --> 1:51:13.000]  I've been awake a lot longer but just kind of got onto your show and I comment quite a bit on there.
[1:51:13.000 --> 1:51:20.000]  The first moment I heard it, I was with my boys getting ready for school and I closed my eyes because I'm a former Marine.
[1:51:20.000 --> 1:51:25.000]  You can just hear the report of several weapons systems going off.
[1:51:25.000 --> 1:51:29.000]  The official line is just falling apart.
[1:51:29.000 --> 1:51:34.000]  Explain that to people as a weapons expert and I've had world-renowned ones on.
[1:51:34.000 --> 1:51:39.000]  Experts like that can say that's a that. You guys know the voice of a gun.
[1:51:39.000 --> 1:51:46.000]  Just like a car expert to learn the noise of an engine or what mufflers they've got or what type of motorcycle it is.
[1:51:46.000 --> 1:51:51.000]  Absolutely. I was a grunt actually. I was really around a lot of different weapons systems.
[1:51:51.000 --> 1:51:58.000]  The initial assault rifle, I think it was, sounded very much like a 556 that was followed very, very quickly.
[1:51:58.000 --> 1:52:04.000]  On top of it, I thought it was a belt-fed weapon, maybe a star, light machine gun of some sort.
[1:52:04.000 --> 1:52:10.000]  The bump starts to theory, I'm not buying it and I have a lot of friends that are not buying it.
[1:52:10.000 --> 1:52:16.000]  Well, that's more news I've got is we've talked to a top acoustics expert and law enforcement.
[1:52:16.000 --> 1:52:19.000]  They say the bump stock thing is a complete red herring.
[1:52:19.000 --> 1:52:25.000]  Absolutely. Absolutely. No doubt in my mind from the very first moment I heard, and I'm three hours from Vegas.
[1:52:25.000 --> 1:52:31.000]  We have friends there at the concert that's video, believe it or not, that's not been released yet, that people are trying to get it to the right hand.
[1:52:31.000 --> 1:52:38.000]  And so that was partly why I wanted to comment about that too, that clearly shows multiple shooters at different locations.
[1:52:38.000 --> 1:52:46.000]  And so hopefully they are able to get that to the right people because I do believe the FBI is defunct.
[1:52:46.000 --> 1:52:49.000]  Well, let me tell you who the right people are. It's the people.
[1:52:49.000 --> 1:52:53.000]  They should load it directly to YouTube and say, here I am. This is what we saw.
[1:52:53.000 --> 1:52:59.000]  They should just not sit on it. They should just get it out to everybody. That's the right people.
[1:52:59.000 --> 1:53:03.000]  They are right. Well, I guess that's the way to go, but I do believe people have to go through it.
[1:53:03.000 --> 1:53:12.000]  Well, if you want us to put you on hold and give you my producer's number, show that if you want, we're happy to have them on or play the video.
[1:53:12.000 --> 1:53:20.000]  We've already got, as you know, bombshell video of them saying police were shooting other folks that were shooting at them a mile away at the other hotels.
[1:53:20.000 --> 1:53:24.000]  You've got the reports of the different rifles for the first two and a half minutes, clearly going on.
[1:53:24.000 --> 1:53:33.000]  So absolutely, Phillip, I'll put you on hold. No pressure. If you don't want to give us your info, but we'd love to talk to those people. God bless you.
[1:53:33.000 --> 1:53:36.000]  Let's get another caller and I can talk to these callers all day. They're so smart.
[1:53:36.000 --> 1:53:40.000]  Let's talk to Kenny in Nebraska. Kenny, thanks for holding her on the air.
[1:53:40.000 --> 1:53:45.000]  Oh, my pleasure. I first want to say thanks for your products. I've been enjoying them for a while now.
[1:53:45.000 --> 1:53:56.000]  And technically, I was calling because, you know, you've been talking about how the entertainment industry in particular has been used as a tool to basically brainwash people.
[1:53:56.000 --> 1:54:04.000]  And unfortunately, we haven't done a good job of using those tools for the other side, especially when it comes to music.
[1:54:04.000 --> 1:54:10.000]  Since the Dixie Chicks fiasco, you know, hardly anybody wants to touch anything politically.
[1:54:10.000 --> 1:54:16.000]  Oh, yeah, that's what they do. They say, we're going to destroy you just because you question any official government story.
[1:54:16.000 --> 1:54:20.000]  Because they'd seen some of my DVDs and they misrepresented it because I confirmed with them.
[1:54:20.000 --> 1:54:25.000]  That's what happened. They were scared to come on. It was right here in Austin. They lived here at the time. They still do some of them.
[1:54:25.000 --> 1:54:29.000]  And yeah, that's an example. They make an example out of one group. Everybody else shuts up.
[1:54:29.000 --> 1:54:32.000]  You know what? That intimidation doesn't work anymore, my friend.
[1:54:32.000 --> 1:54:41.000]  Yeah, but unfortunately, it is still pretty prevalent in the music industry. I produce music basically. You can call it Info Wars or Patriot music.
[1:54:41.000 --> 1:54:48.000]  And I have been for about the last four years. I work with a friend of mine. It's a Nashville staff writer here in Omaha.
[1:54:48.000 --> 1:54:56.000]  And that's basically the feedback that I've gotten from him is he doesn't want to touch it with a 10 foot pole because, you know, of the potential.
[1:54:56.000 --> 1:55:02.000]  And now with them shutting down Facebook and your opportunity to be able to promote your music personally, you know.
[1:55:02.000 --> 1:55:09.000]  Oh, absolutely. We got the whole evil mainstream media Hollywood globalist cabal on our back, brother. But here's the deal.
[1:55:09.000 --> 1:55:17.000]  Once we're awake and we know they're on our back, just like a buck in Bronco or a bull, they're not going to stay on our back forever.
[1:55:17.000 --> 1:55:22.000]  They can hold on for dear life, but they're never going to make the full eight seconds they want.
[1:55:22.000 --> 1:55:30.000]  But send me some information at ShowtipsInfoWars.com. I'm more and more. Millie Weaver had this idea. I do have this idea years ago as well.
[1:55:30.000 --> 1:55:38.000]  I mean, you know, smart folks have the same ideas to have some music shows that are specifically to highlight independent new music.
[1:55:38.000 --> 1:55:43.000]  The problem is you run into their producers and then other stuff and it's a minefield.
[1:55:43.000 --> 1:55:48.000]  And so anything that's kind of Hollywood and I appreciate your call, Kenny, just gets a little weird.
[1:55:48.000 --> 1:55:53.000]  And so that's why, you know, it's hard for us to ever promote stuff or get involved, but I'm sure you're great.
[1:55:53.000 --> 1:55:59.000]  But, you know, there's so much great patriot music online and a lot of it gets millions of views, millions of lessons.
[1:55:59.000 --> 1:56:11.000]  It just doesn't get Hollywood recognition, but you don't need that if you're playing to a crowd of 100 people about the truth, you know, and, you know, sell 5,000, you know, songs or DVDs or CDs, you're winning.
[1:56:11.000 --> 1:56:15.000]  But it is about everybody supporting the media that they think is helping the world.
[1:56:15.000 --> 1:56:20.000]  Just like info wars 50% off right now on our great brain pill.
[1:56:20.000 --> 1:56:28.000]  The, of course, brain force plus 20% more now in each bottle 50% off that special is going to happen in very, very soon.
[1:56:28.000 --> 1:56:34.000]  Very, very powerful. Neutropic. It's just the best. Neutropic science out there discounted at 50% off.
[1:56:34.000 --> 1:56:36.000]  It's really discounted. Okay.
[1:56:36.000 --> 1:56:44.000]  So for 1996 instead of 3995, it is an unprecedented high quality product 40% off on survival shield X2.
[1:56:44.000 --> 1:56:48.000]  The good halogen. Find out why that's so important. Such a game changer for most people.
[1:56:48.000 --> 1:56:54.000]  And you can also get bio tricillinium 40% off as well.
[1:56:54.000 --> 1:56:56.000]  And those two go together.
[1:56:56.000 --> 1:57:01.000]  The survival shield X2 and the bio tricillinium are both essential without those. You die.
[1:57:01.000 --> 1:57:05.000]  And there's a lot of deficiency of tricillinium that is organically plant derived.
[1:57:05.000 --> 1:57:14.000]  Selenium and of deep earth crystal source iodine. It's actually absorbable into the body. Read the thousands of five star reviews at info wars live.com.

[2:00:03.000 --> 2:00:10.000]  Live from Austin Texas Broadcasting Worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[2:00:10.000 --> 2:00:18.000]  Man, these calls have been great. We've got to take more calls. We've been doing it.
[2:00:18.000 --> 2:00:26.000]  I got into work a little bit late today dealing with a whole bunch of stuff. The good, the bad and the ugly.
[2:00:26.000 --> 2:00:36.000]  And I just cannot believe that they're now admitting the official Vegas story isn't true.
[2:00:36.000 --> 2:00:42.000]  They're really walking it all back now, aren't they?
[2:00:42.000 --> 2:00:52.000]  And I noticed they went from probably, let's not exaggerate, 100 publications or more a day lying about me saying the shooting never happened
[2:00:52.000 --> 2:01:02.000]  or saying there were multiple shooters or saying, you know, things I did say, things I didn't say, to just basically almost nothing.
[2:01:02.000 --> 2:01:09.000]  They had the New York Times put out something that a bunch of people followed and a bunch of other media folks copied.
[2:01:09.000 --> 2:01:13.000]  But you could tell they are really weak.
[2:01:13.000 --> 2:01:20.000]  And they're waiting for the other shooter drop because they made their own phone calls, their own sources, their own moles.
[2:01:20.000 --> 2:01:25.000]  Like the guy running the FBI in Vegas, our source to say is as bad as it gets.
[2:01:25.000 --> 2:01:32.000]  And they said, yeah, you might want to stop saying that about Jones being a liar because we're not going to be able to contain it.
[2:01:32.000 --> 2:01:40.000]  They may make up some whole new story, but they know. They knew before the body was cold and other bodies were cold, who did it?
[2:01:40.000 --> 2:01:47.000]  And it's heartening to know there's good people in the FBI.
[2:01:47.000 --> 2:01:51.000]  But those are the people that actually live in the real world and pull triggers.
[2:01:51.000 --> 2:02:05.000]  The little political coneheads up on top are just a click of social climbing. Yes, men, and they'll do anything.
[2:02:05.000 --> 2:02:09.000]  So yeah, if you just joined us, I'm going back to your phone calls.
[2:02:09.000 --> 2:02:24.000]  Don Salazar's article is on news wars.com and it links the Associated Press saying the casino owner says the official story is not true.
[2:02:24.000 --> 2:02:29.000]  And he, you know, the guy shot other people beforehand, everything we've been telling you.
[2:02:29.000 --> 2:02:31.000]  And he wants the Middle East just like we first told you.
[2:02:31.000 --> 2:02:34.000]  I mean, everything our sources told you.
[2:02:34.000 --> 2:02:42.000]  We're just crazy enough when the Secret Service says she's got a black ambulance and is having convulsions every 45 minutes just fall.
[2:02:42.000 --> 2:02:47.000]  Well, well, give me the tales what you have. Alex, don't worry about it. Just tell your audience to follow her around.
[2:02:47.000 --> 2:02:49.000]  You'll get her on tape.
[2:02:49.000 --> 2:02:52.000]  And a month later, she fell flat on her face, having a convulsion.
[2:02:52.000 --> 2:02:59.000]  A week before, Millie Weaver and Gavin Wentz caught her collapsing inside a tent for an hour at one of her events with guys with medical scratchers.
[2:02:59.000 --> 2:03:05.000]  I mean, she's got a really tortured life.
[2:03:05.000 --> 2:03:12.000]  I mean, they got to roll her out quick, drugged up, roll her back out.
[2:03:12.000 --> 2:03:15.000]  Our sources don't violate federal law and give you medical records.
[2:03:15.000 --> 2:03:24.000]  They just said, Alex, people get brain tumors and people have them removed in 2013, but a lot of times they come back.
[2:03:24.000 --> 2:03:28.000]  Hell, they might say John McCain doesn't have a brain tumor.
[2:03:28.000 --> 2:03:30.000]  That might be the next thing.
[2:03:30.000 --> 2:03:39.000]  So we broke that.
[2:03:39.000 --> 2:03:41.000]  And yeah, the Secret Service wanted Trump to win.
[2:03:41.000 --> 2:03:49.000]  Because Hillary and everybody treats them like crap.
[2:03:49.000 --> 2:03:53.000]  But it's the same thing. I mean, these are real sources.
[2:03:53.000 --> 2:03:58.000]  And now the sources have been proven super accurate.
[2:03:58.000 --> 2:04:01.000]  It just gets a little creepy when they call up and say, now answer our question.
[2:04:01.000 --> 2:04:05.000]  How did you say they're going to attack at 10 o'clock at night?
[2:04:05.000 --> 2:04:07.000]  And I'm like, I don't remember that.
[2:04:07.000 --> 2:04:14.000]  And they're like, no, here's the, oh, I just meant like that'd be a good time to attack a big crowd, you know, during police shift changes.
[2:04:14.000 --> 2:04:16.000]  And that's, that's how I do it.
[2:04:16.000 --> 2:04:21.000]  And they're like, oh, they don't think I'm involved or anything.
[2:04:21.000 --> 2:04:26.000]  It's just, it's just, this is getting too weird for me.
[2:04:26.000 --> 2:04:30.000]  Okay. I mean, this is getting really weird at this point.
[2:04:30.000 --> 2:04:32.000]  But I just love the media saying we made it up.
[2:04:32.000 --> 2:04:37.000]  What I'm just going to get on air and say, the hostage rescue team told us that they shot him and he didn't do it.
[2:04:37.000 --> 2:04:41.000]  Now that's coming out and that they shot other people before and the official story is not true.
[2:04:41.000 --> 2:04:49.000]  And that there was, he went to the Middle East and there was always paraphernalia there and all the anti-fun Islamic stuff.
[2:04:49.000 --> 2:04:54.000]  And I mean, that really happened.
[2:05:20.000 --> 2:05:24.000]  But the right to keep and bear arms is not an outdated, dusty idea.
[2:05:24.000 --> 2:05:28.000]  Some old dead white guys dreamed up in fear of the Redcoats.
[2:05:28.000 --> 2:05:33.000]  No, it is just as essential to liberty today as it was in 1776.
[2:05:33.000 --> 2:05:40.000]  The original amendments we refer to as the Bill of Rights contain 10 of what the constitutional framers termed unalienable rights.
[2:05:40.000 --> 2:05:43.000]  The Bill of Rights came to us with blinders on.
[2:05:43.000 --> 2:05:46.000]  It doesn't recognize color or class or wealth.
[2:05:46.000 --> 2:05:53.000]  It protects not just the rights of actors or editors or reporters, but extends even to those we love to hate.
[2:05:53.000 --> 2:06:21.000]  This is a small excerpt from Tralton Heston.
[2:06:24.000 --> 2:06:29.000]  I've been watching and I've been waiting.
[2:06:29.000 --> 2:06:36.000]  I'm your host Alex Jones.
[2:06:36.000 --> 2:06:40.000]  We're going to go to Josh, Jesse, Dave, Andy, Kelly and many others.
[2:06:40.000 --> 2:06:54.000]  Toll free number to join us, 877-789-Alex, 877-789-2539.
[2:06:54.000 --> 2:07:09.000]  Hungry's leaders have come out with documents that are public, how the EU and George Soros plan to overthrow the entire European system to make it Islamic as a attack on Christianity.
[2:07:09.000 --> 2:07:18.000]  Because they're Satanists and the government now is issuing emergency reports to the public detailing the Satanism of George Soros, his son and the rest of their family.
[2:07:18.000 --> 2:07:21.000]  And there are photos of his son at Satanic rituals.
[2:07:21.000 --> 2:07:25.000]  So you see, just suddenly everybody's going all the way.
[2:07:25.000 --> 2:07:26.000]  Sounds insane?
[2:07:26.000 --> 2:07:28.000]  Well, they are devil worshipers.
[2:07:28.000 --> 2:07:32.000]  So it's on.
[2:07:32.000 --> 2:07:43.000]  So that article is at newswars.com, Hungry declared Soros an agent of Satan, Hungarian's battling former Nazi asset at spiritual level.
[2:07:43.000 --> 2:07:45.000]  Dan Lyman.
[2:07:45.000 --> 2:07:51.000]  See, as soon as we figure out it's spiritual, we stop losing, we start winning.
[2:07:51.000 --> 2:07:59.000]  The minute we run back to Jesus Christ, for real, not virtually signaling like these fake churches.
[2:07:59.000 --> 2:08:09.000]  But the minute we go back to Christ, the minute the hedge goes back up, the success, the Providence, all of it goes back up.
[2:08:09.000 --> 2:08:18.000]  The globalists are constantly, just drop God and let us teach your kids and go along with us and let Mr. Weinstein be your boss and everything will be okay.
[2:08:18.000 --> 2:08:23.000]  Here's Pennywise the clown, he's going to take care of you, he'll take care of your kids.
[2:08:23.000 --> 2:08:36.000]  The minute you say no to these vampires, they run for the hills screaming back to where they came from.
[2:08:36.000 --> 2:08:44.000]  So we're going to go to your phone calls right now.
[2:08:44.000 --> 2:08:49.000]  And then coming up the start of the next segment, powerful new video.
[2:08:49.000 --> 2:08:54.000]  The Jeremy Green put together, titled Hollywood's Message to Donald Trump.
[2:08:54.000 --> 2:08:58.000]  And remember, when they say Donald Trump, they mean you.
[2:08:58.000 --> 2:09:02.000]  And I'm not trying to get you to identify yourself personally as Trump.
[2:09:02.000 --> 2:09:05.000]  The enemy, when they see NRA, they think gun owner.
[2:09:05.000 --> 2:09:14.000]  When they see Trump, they think average American, black, white, Hispanic, Asian, old, young that wants freedom.
[2:09:14.000 --> 2:09:24.000]  Now I say don't just put all your eggs in Trump's basket or all your eggs in Info Wars basket or all your eggs in the NRA's basket because I could be killed.
[2:09:24.000 --> 2:09:25.000]  Trump could be compromised, killed.
[2:09:25.000 --> 2:09:26.000]  The NRA could be overtaken.
[2:09:26.000 --> 2:09:27.000]  This board destroyed.
[2:09:27.000 --> 2:09:36.000]  Believe me, they've been after him behind the scenes that they've not been successful.
[2:09:36.000 --> 2:09:38.000]  But you got to trust in God.
[2:09:38.000 --> 2:09:40.000]  You got to trust in your gut.
[2:09:40.000 --> 2:09:43.000]  You got to trust yourself.
[2:09:43.000 --> 2:09:50.000]  You start trusting in your own good which and the sense God gave you.
[2:09:50.000 --> 2:09:53.000]  The sense God gave you, that's God.
[2:09:53.000 --> 2:09:56.000]  That discernment.
[2:09:56.000 --> 2:09:58.000]  The enemy's easy to beat at that point.
[2:09:58.000 --> 2:10:07.000]  That's why they hate us so much, folks, because they know we're hundreds of times better, stronger, faster.
[2:10:07.000 --> 2:10:10.000]  We just don't seek power.
[2:10:10.000 --> 2:10:21.000]  That's why these spiritual midgets hate our guts because you're strong.
[2:10:21.000 --> 2:10:24.000]  That's why they target the people that are strong.
[2:10:24.000 --> 2:10:34.000]  Any group you see being oppressed is because they're strong and because they're the next target for take down.
[2:10:34.000 --> 2:10:47.000]  The globalists have taken down most of the groups and now there's one bastion halfway left in the globalist mind, in Hollywood's mind, and that's the Midwest.
[2:10:47.000 --> 2:10:57.000]  And they say it's white because they don't want to get people to fight with each other, but they mean Christian.
[2:10:57.000 --> 2:11:13.000]  They've got a message for you of hate and despair and of curses. Why not just like Mike Pence did, just get up in that cult 49ers game when two guys did their kneeling and all the rest of it and just walk out.
[2:11:13.000 --> 2:11:21.000]  Because you know what, those thugs, those little nobodies, they need you.
[2:11:21.000 --> 2:11:25.000]  You don't need them.
[2:11:25.000 --> 2:11:34.000]  And that simple act of coming out of Babylon brings this system to its knees.
[2:11:34.000 --> 2:11:36.000]  So do it.
[2:11:36.000 --> 2:11:38.000]  Use the power you got.
[2:11:38.000 --> 2:11:40.000]  Shop with the good guys.
[2:11:40.000 --> 2:11:44.000]  Promote the patriots locally and nationally.
[2:11:44.000 --> 2:11:46.000]  Support the good little church, that's all the truth.
[2:11:46.000 --> 2:11:53.000]  Not the big mega one that looks so nice and makes you feel so good and there's all these neat people to meet.
[2:11:53.000 --> 2:11:58.000]  I mean, all these big mega churches are swinger clubs. You know that, right?
[2:11:58.000 --> 2:12:02.000]  You want to go pick a woman up just like that, go to a mega church.
[2:12:02.000 --> 2:12:06.000]  You want to go swinging to where you go.
[2:12:06.000 --> 2:12:11.000]  Folks, I'm not saying that to be mean. Everybody that goes to him knows that.
[2:12:11.000 --> 2:12:14.000]  Or they're stupid.
[2:12:14.000 --> 2:12:17.000]  They're country clubs.
[2:12:17.000 --> 2:12:20.000]  They're not real.
[2:12:20.000 --> 2:12:25.000]  They're people that want to hedge their bets. You know, they say Hillary Clinton goes to Christian church.
[2:12:25.000 --> 2:12:29.000]  Doesn't really pray to God, but just goes and then also goes voodoo stuff, devil worship.
[2:12:29.000 --> 2:12:32.000]  She says she doesn't even know what's real. She's such a robot.
[2:12:32.000 --> 2:12:38.000]  She's just betting. She's just hoping. She just, she's just in the dark.
[2:12:38.000 --> 2:12:45.000]  Aren't you glad you're not that spiritually cut off?
[2:12:45.000 --> 2:12:50.000]  John in New York, you've been holding a long time. Thanks for holding. Go ahead.
[2:12:50.000 --> 2:12:53.000]  You say John or Josh?
[2:12:53.000 --> 2:12:57.000]  Josh, I apologize. I told him to move that screen closer. I can hardly read it. Go ahead.
[2:12:57.000 --> 2:13:00.000]  That's all right. How are you doing, Alex? Good to talk to you.
[2:13:00.000 --> 2:13:01.000]  Good brother. Thanks for holding.
[2:13:01.000 --> 2:13:07.000]  Quick, quick. Before I get to my question, I just want to say that Harvey Weinstein, that is the creepiest thing I've ever heard in my life.
[2:13:07.000 --> 2:13:13.000]  Didn't it sound like get the clown trying to get Georgie into the stick of his arm in the drainage ditch?
[2:13:13.000 --> 2:13:17.000]  It really did. I can't believe how these people would actually talk to somebody like that.
[2:13:17.000 --> 2:13:19.000]  It's just amazing to me.
[2:13:19.000 --> 2:13:27.000]  Well, I had Hollywood, a bunch of big names in the system trying to get me involved, and I was like, no, thank you.
[2:13:27.000 --> 2:13:31.000]  No, it's just really weird out there. I like staying out in the country.
[2:13:31.000 --> 2:13:34.000]  I'm in New York, but I'm in the country too.
[2:13:34.000 --> 2:13:38.000]  Hey, the New York country is beautiful. Some of the prettiest places in the world.
[2:13:38.000 --> 2:13:43.000]  Oh, yeah. So my question for you is, I've noticed when I've been looking around online and stuff, I can't find us.
[2:13:43.000 --> 2:13:48.000]  Right after the shooting, before the bodies were even cold, they started saying it's the biggest mass shooting in the U.S. history.
[2:13:48.000 --> 2:13:52.000]  Do you know yourself? How many people were actually shot of the dead and injured?
[2:13:52.000 --> 2:13:58.000]  Yeah, it was 500 plus, and it was 59 dead. It was 58, not 59 dead.
[2:13:58.000 --> 2:14:04.000]  But truly, I mean, one called mass shooting of people unarmed, it would be wounded knee. That was as high as 300.
[2:14:04.000 --> 2:14:08.000]  So it's the biggest mass shooting in modern history.
[2:14:08.000 --> 2:14:12.000]  Well, what I was asking was, I'll be injured in the dead. Were all of them shootings?
[2:14:12.000 --> 2:14:16.000]  I don't see it all being shootings, but the way the crowd was running out. You know what I mean?
[2:14:16.000 --> 2:14:22.000]  Oh, yeah. I mean, remember the famous Rolling Stones concert?
[2:14:22.000 --> 2:14:28.000]  Where hundreds of people got trampled, a bunch of folks died? One person got stabbed, and somebody got shot.
[2:14:28.000 --> 2:14:33.000]  Then the crowd stay impeded, and that killed. How many folks did that Rolling Stone deal?
[2:14:33.000 --> 2:14:36.000]  Wasn't that out in Nevada too?
[2:14:36.000 --> 2:14:41.000]  It was Altamont, I believe, and the Hells Angels were the security guard. I think that's the one you're referring to.
[2:14:41.000 --> 2:14:45.000]  Yep, the Hells Angels were the security guard. So where is that?
[2:14:45.000 --> 2:14:49.000]  Altamont. I'm not sure what state that was in. I know the name of the concert was Altamont.
[2:14:49.000 --> 2:14:55.000]  Yeah, look up the Rolling Stones. There it is. The Rolling Stones disaster at Altamont.
[2:14:55.000 --> 2:15:02.000]  Let It Bleed was the name of the album, and where is Altamont based? California.
[2:15:02.000 --> 2:15:07.000]  It's high desert, though, isn't it?
[2:15:07.000 --> 2:15:13.000]  All right. Well, thank you. It was California, not that. Really good point, Josh. Anything else?
[2:15:13.000 --> 2:15:16.000]  That's it, man. Keep up the good work, brother.
[2:15:16.000 --> 2:15:30.000]  Thank you. We're going to come back, intro this short video, and then go right to Dave and St. Louis, Andy in Indiana, Kelly in Wisconsin, and then Jesse in Tennessee and others.

[2:19:05.000 --> 2:19:10.000]  That's why I'm introducing ZShield Toxic Metal and Chemical Defense Support.
[2:19:10.000 --> 2:19:18.000]  It's made in the USA. It's filled with known compounds from nature that are absolutely associated with detoxifying the body and it supports the InfoWars.
[2:19:18.000 --> 2:19:20.000]  It is a classical 360 win.
[2:19:20.000 --> 2:19:30.000]  This is the formula that I personally have been taking for over a year and now we believe we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly get.
[2:19:30.000 --> 2:19:40.000]  You owe it to yourself, you owe it to your family, and you owe it to the future of this country in the world that patriots stay as healthy and as clean and as focused as you can be.
[2:19:40.000 --> 2:19:47.000]  Because we need you, the remnant of America, to reignite those brush fires the next level and to be healthy and as focused as you can be.
[2:19:47.000 --> 2:19:50.000]  Thanks to your support and your prayers together, we're changing the world.
[2:19:50.000 --> 2:20:18.000]  Now it's time to change our bodies with ZShield InfoWarsLive.com.
[2:20:21.000 --> 2:20:26.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show or what I call InfoWarsLive.
[2:20:26.000 --> 2:20:29.000]  We're now on air 10 hours a day live.
[2:20:29.000 --> 2:20:36.000]  David Knight, 8 a.m. to 11 a.m. when I go live here at the same studios in Austin, Texas.
[2:20:36.000 --> 2:20:45.000]  And then Owen Schroeder comes on the three o'clock central with the War Room with all the great contributors that are part of that transmission as well.
[2:20:45.000 --> 2:20:57.000]  You know, I think we really should have a Hollywood Rapes America contest.
[2:20:57.000 --> 2:21:14.000]  Mike Cernovich called me last night or texted me and said we should have, just like my Bill Clinton's, a rapist contest that was so successful because of you out there taking action, changed the world, changed this country, changed the planet, changed our future trajectory for the better, clearly.
[2:21:14.000 --> 2:21:34.000]  He said you ought to have a Weinstein's or Rapist, Harvey Weinstein's or Rapist $1,000 prize for anybody that says it to any major Hollywood star, maybe $4,000 or $5,000 for those directly affiliated with Weinstein or on any national television show.
[2:21:34.000 --> 2:21:38.000]  And just how about Hollywood Rapes America?
[2:21:38.000 --> 2:21:52.000]  How about Hollywood Rapes America? Cernovich's got his hashtag boycott Hollywood, that's good. Daria put on a real Alex Jones, Hollywood is dead.
[2:21:52.000 --> 2:22:11.000]  And they've been dead for a long time, but they tried to kill America. They had to tell us how to be moral and let them sexualize our children. And we sat there and went along with it. And the NFL wanted to sit there and lecture everybody and use divisiveness.
[2:22:11.000 --> 2:22:19.000]  Your reign of bullying care is over. And just because you idiots haven't figured it out yet, doesn't mean it isn't the case.
[2:22:19.000 --> 2:22:33.000]  But I'm not like you that just declares things to act like we're in charge. No, I only declare something when it's true. And most of America of every race, color and creed were all one race, red blood created by God.
[2:22:33.000 --> 2:22:39.000]  No, you're of the enemy and are sick of Bill Clinton and all of you people.
[2:22:39.000 --> 2:22:50.000]  Soulless servants of Satan. There you see Weinstein trying to crowd in in a photo with Trump.
[2:22:50.000 --> 2:22:55.000]  And I'm not saying Trump's perfect, but he's at war with Hollywood and they're at war with him. And what should I tell you?
[2:22:55.000 --> 2:23:12.000]  That tell you he may he was Saul of Tarsus on the road to Damascus. Well, he was just bad as Saul, but he's definitely been hit by the Thunderbolt. And the enemy knows it. They know he's a new man on a mission fatalistic.
[2:23:12.000 --> 2:23:22.000]  And that's why they've got this message for Donald J. Trump. Here's Hollywood's message.
[2:23:22.000 --> 2:23:25.000]  He's not a tough guy. He's a bully and he's a bitch.
[2:23:25.000 --> 2:23:29.000]  He's a punk. He's a dog. He's a pig.
[2:23:29.000 --> 2:23:31.000]  And he can suck my ****.
[2:23:31.000 --> 2:23:33.000]  He's a con, a bullshit artist, a mutt.
[2:23:33.000 --> 2:23:37.000]  I'll meet him in the hotel with anyone the **** day of the week and give him a Louisville slugger.
[2:23:37.000 --> 2:23:39.000]  I'd like to punch him in the face.
[2:23:39.000 --> 2:23:44.000]  He's my mother **** as you bitch punk **** sucker.
[2:23:44.000 --> 2:23:52.000]  Died!
[2:23:52.000 --> 2:24:01.000]  Pointing what appears to be a water gun, the image of President Donald Trump projected on a whiteboard, our teacher Pale Modi has not been seen by countless viewers across the internet.
[2:24:01.000 --> 2:24:07.000]  Yes. I have thought an awful lot about blowing up the White House.
[2:24:07.000 --> 2:24:15.000]  It's an actor dressed to look just like President Donald Trump as he's assassinated on stage.
[2:24:15.000 --> 2:24:24.000]  Pictures and video depicting comedian Cathy Griffin holding the bloody, decapitated head of President Trump are no joking matter for the Secret Service.
[2:24:24.000 --> 2:24:30.000]  A rhetoric that has inspired the violence has come from the mainstream of the Democratic Party.
[2:24:30.000 --> 2:24:43.000]  They're involved in the coup, an active attempt to start a bloody, civil war.
[2:24:43.000 --> 2:24:49.000]  You're receiving this transmission.
[2:24:49.000 --> 2:24:55.000]  If you are resuming this transition, you are resistance.
[2:24:55.000 --> 2:25:00.000]  And they're scared. That's why they call themselves the resistance now. Plagiarists, frauds all.
[2:25:00.000 --> 2:25:03.000]  They're going to write back to your calls.
[2:25:03.000 --> 2:25:09.000]  But understand, they're all teleprompter readers. They're all script readers.
[2:25:09.000 --> 2:25:20.000]  So Hollywood reads what the moguls, what the elites that own Hollywood want, what the Communist Chinese and the Islamists that together control Hollywood.
[2:25:20.000 --> 2:25:23.000]  That's right.
[2:25:23.000 --> 2:25:27.000]  The sellout scum in Hollywood completely sold out.
[2:25:27.000 --> 2:25:33.000]  And then Soros even got caught wanting to overthrow Israel itself.
[2:25:33.000 --> 2:25:37.000]  And I only say that because I'm not a defender of Israel. I'm not a hater of Israel.
[2:25:37.000 --> 2:25:41.000]  It's a complex country just like America and decadent just like we are.
[2:25:41.000 --> 2:25:45.000]  Big problems. I don't hate Israel.
[2:25:45.000 --> 2:25:50.000]  But it's so much more complex. You have the Arabs and China controlling Hollywood
[2:25:50.000 --> 2:25:57.000]  and a bunch of rich Israel hating leftist Jews selling out to it.
[2:25:57.000 --> 2:26:06.000]  And then the Soros documents are how they're going to overthrow Israel and America inside with the Muslims.
[2:26:06.000 --> 2:26:11.000]  The most radical forms of Islam. That's the real battlescape.
[2:26:11.000 --> 2:26:17.000]  That's the real players. The corrupt Vatican hijacked by the globalist.
[2:26:17.000 --> 2:26:24.000]  The corrupt EU, Saudi Arabia, Wahhabism, allied with Hollywood, mainstream media.
[2:26:24.000 --> 2:26:29.000]  I said I'd go to your calls and I did in this segment. I'm a bad person.
[2:26:29.000 --> 2:26:31.000]  Who's been on the longest here? I'll get to one.
[2:26:31.000 --> 2:26:35.000]  David St. Louis, you're on the air. What do you think?
[2:26:35.000 --> 2:26:38.000]  Hey, Alex. First time caller. Appreciate it.
[2:26:38.000 --> 2:26:39.000]  Welcome.
[2:26:39.000 --> 2:26:44.000]  My take on everything is with the hotel shooting.
[2:26:44.000 --> 2:26:49.000]  I don't know. I've stayed in hotels before. I've heard people above me and I've heard people below me.
[2:26:49.000 --> 2:26:55.000]  Where are the other guests in the hotel? Why aren't they being spoken to by the media?
[2:26:55.000 --> 2:26:59.000]  The whole thing rakes. What do you think?
[2:26:59.000 --> 2:27:09.000]  I think it's all covered up. It's probably either Antifa, ISIS, CIA, maybe all of it together.
[2:27:09.000 --> 2:27:13.000]  And I don't think we'll ever know the truth, man. I doubt it.
[2:27:13.000 --> 2:27:18.000]  Well, I agree with you and what do you make of them having to back off now and have the hotel owner,
[2:27:18.000 --> 2:27:23.000]  everybody say, okay, we've changed the timeline and the hotel owner says no one's being told the truth.
[2:27:23.000 --> 2:27:28.000]  I mean, this is huge. This is like in the Associated Press, but notice it's not getting any coverage now.
[2:27:28.000 --> 2:27:35.000]  Exactly. I mean, everyday news that you watch when you wake up to have your coffee, neighborhood gets shut up or something.
[2:27:35.000 --> 2:27:41.000]  What do you see? You see eyewitnesses, you see people that hear everything going on and they're the ones being interviewed.
[2:27:41.000 --> 2:27:46.000]  You don't see that. They're shutting it up completely, man. They are.
[2:27:46.000 --> 2:27:52.000]  Well, that's, you know, before the 90s, when there was a terror attack, they cover it up, so it wouldn't give the terrorists what they wanted.
[2:27:52.000 --> 2:27:53.000]  And I just think...
[2:27:53.000 --> 2:27:55.000]  Well, this brother can't do that now.
[2:27:55.000 --> 2:27:56.000]  Exactly.
[2:27:56.000 --> 2:28:01.000]  You and I have the capable means to show the world what the truth is.
[2:28:01.000 --> 2:28:06.000]  So what are they going to do now, Dave, as this all comes out?
[2:28:06.000 --> 2:28:10.000]  They're going to divert attention to something else. They always will.
[2:28:10.000 --> 2:28:14.000]  Like Weinstein. Like, like, like Weinstein.
[2:28:14.000 --> 2:28:15.000]  Exactly.
[2:28:15.000 --> 2:28:18.000]  And Trump's calm before the storm.
[2:28:18.000 --> 2:28:29.000]  You know, it's all covered up. And on the idea of him being radical, I can tell you firsthand, you need to look at the prisons in the United States.
[2:28:29.000 --> 2:28:34.000]  I was in it for two and a half years. I watched people get converted over to Islam.
[2:28:34.000 --> 2:28:40.000]  They push it on them because they know they're going to get out and do the same damn thing over again.
[2:28:40.000 --> 2:28:45.000]  Absolutely. Yeah, that's what the prisons are, is giant Islamic recruitment centers.
[2:28:45.000 --> 2:28:47.000]  Thank you so much, Dave. Great points.
[2:28:47.000 --> 2:29:05.000]  And Kelly Jesse, I'm going to write to you on the other side. We'll be right back on Alex Jones.
[2:29:17.000 --> 2:29:22.000]  Whether it's your home or office, you owe it to yourself, your coworkers, your family, your children.

[2:29:24.000 --> 2:29:32.000]  The elite are masters at poisoning our environment while themselves doing things that mitigate or avoid most toxic effects for themselves.
[2:29:32.000 --> 2:29:34.000]  The general public doesn't.
[2:29:34.000 --> 2:29:38.000]  The Alexa Pure Breeze would be a steal at $300, $400, $500.
[2:29:38.000 --> 2:29:42.000]  One of these systems can keep 800 square feet incredibly clean.
[2:29:42.000 --> 2:29:49.000]  This is a system I'm personally putting in throughout my house replacing older, more expensive filters that didn't do as good a job.

[2:29:56.000 --> 2:30:01.000]  As most of you already know, I am a voracious consumer of news and information.
[2:30:01.000 --> 2:30:09.000]  And in the last four or five years doing more and more research, I came across the fact that the elite establishment is fully aware of the fact
[2:30:09.000 --> 2:30:14.000]  that our ancient ancestors, in many cases, had much better nutrition than we do today.
[2:30:14.000 --> 2:30:21.000]  And our ancient ancestors sought out the bones of the animals that they were hunting, killing, and then processing.
[2:30:21.000 --> 2:30:27.000]  And so I set out to develop Caveman, but to not just have concentrated bone broth from chicken,
[2:30:27.000 --> 2:30:34.000]  but seven other superfood ingredients known for cleansing and supercharging the body at the same time.

[2:33:13.000 --> 2:33:18.000]  It's Alex Jones.
[2:33:44.000 --> 2:33:51.000]  Look, his only crime so far in Hollywood is that he wasn't raping small children.
[2:33:51.000 --> 2:33:56.000]  But don't think for a moment that that isn't going to come out.
[2:33:56.000 --> 2:34:09.000]  Because in the sociopath, psychopath, elite maggot class, you don't even get entrance or entree into what they're doing unless you want to prey on the innocence.
[2:34:09.000 --> 2:34:16.000]  And there is a global revolution against that, the tide of people waking up is coming in.
[2:34:16.000 --> 2:34:25.000]  Because there's a lot of lazy people in the world, but there's also a lot of sociopaths and psychopaths that like to feed on people or just don't care.
[2:34:25.000 --> 2:34:34.000]  And then there's folks that do care, they get manipulated by the psychopaths and sociopaths using news to make us guilty and do what they say.
[2:34:34.000 --> 2:34:47.000]  But as people that do have conscience wake up, as that unfolds, the enemy begins to go into full panic.
[2:34:47.000 --> 2:34:50.000]  What was that? You guys put amazing stuff on screen all the time.
[2:34:50.000 --> 2:34:55.000]  They put a news article up about the pedophile that Hollywood embraces a director.
[2:34:55.000 --> 2:34:59.000]  I didn't know that, but put that back up for me, please.
[2:34:59.000 --> 2:35:10.000]  Looks like John Wayne Gacy, but it's not. The pedophile director embraced by Hollywood.
[2:35:10.000 --> 2:35:22.000]  That's The Daily Beast, and then let's read about it. Filmmaker Victor Salva was convicted of raping a 12-year-old boy, but his new film, Jeepers Creepers 3, is now playing in theaters.
[2:35:22.000 --> 2:35:24.000]  Why is Hollywood given the monster of pass?
[2:35:24.000 --> 2:35:27.000]  Well, what does The Daily Beast give Hillary Clinton a pass?
[2:35:27.000 --> 2:35:30.000]  But see, now they're starting to report on it.
[2:35:30.000 --> 2:35:36.000]  Yeah, that's just this month, just a few days ago, because they understand the tides turned.
[2:35:36.000 --> 2:35:40.000]  Salons even pulled down all their pro-pedophile articles.
[2:35:40.000 --> 2:35:42.000]  Yeah, that was this month.
[2:35:42.000 --> 2:35:50.000]  They had articles up there with men, with videos of five-year-old girls dancing in front of them, talking about it's okay if they want to have sex with them.
[2:35:50.000 --> 2:35:58.000]  I mean, imagine the warped evil, but again, they went too far. See, let's go to your phone calls.
[2:35:58.000 --> 2:36:02.000]  Let me see, Andy's been holding the longest, and Kelly, Sean, Jesse, and others.
[2:36:02.000 --> 2:36:06.000]  Andy and Indiana, you're on the air. Thank you for holding. Go ahead.
[2:36:06.000 --> 2:36:08.000]  Thanks for taking my phone call, Alex.
[2:36:08.000 --> 2:36:10.000]  Thank you.
[2:36:10.000 --> 2:36:18.000]  I wanted to let you know you were such a breath of fresh air when it comes to any type of media people could listen to today.
[2:36:18.000 --> 2:36:21.000]  Well, I'm just like you. I'm a regular guy that has a show, bro.
[2:36:21.000 --> 2:36:25.000]  We're just here looking at a pile of pedophile scum in Hollywood and saying we're done.
[2:36:25.000 --> 2:36:27.000]  A bunch of steroid head spoiled brats.
[2:36:27.000 --> 2:36:32.000]  SKW is fun about Hollywood and the NFL saying they hate everybody, so we hate them too.
[2:36:32.000 --> 2:36:39.000]  I mean, it's all just basically that we started pulling away from them, so they're freaking out trying to bully us back into submission.
[2:36:39.000 --> 2:36:40.000]  Go ahead.
[2:36:40.000 --> 2:36:47.000]  Can't agree with you more. I just want to tell you, I started listening back in February when you were on the Joe Rogan podcast.
[2:36:47.000 --> 2:36:56.000]  And I've been a listener ever since. And I think that's important because the first time I heard you, you were uncensored, unfiltered.
[2:36:56.000 --> 2:37:01.000]  And I really got to know that you have sources. You say it as it is.
[2:37:01.000 --> 2:37:10.000]  And to be honest, being able to get out of more platforms like that, I think is only going to help grow the info war because I'm an average American, right?
[2:37:10.000 --> 2:37:12.000]  I'm a mid-20s smart guy.
[2:37:12.000 --> 2:37:18.000]  When I hear you, I'm really connected with you. And I want to talk about something else.
[2:37:18.000 --> 2:37:26.000]  I don't know if you guys just saw in the Drudge Report that there is a pharmacist that delivers drugs directly to congressmen and women.
[2:37:26.000 --> 2:37:31.000]  And it says that women have Alzheimer's. Have you seen that on Drudge yet?
[2:37:31.000 --> 2:37:37.000]  Yes, I have. It's very powerful. We have our own story about it as well.
[2:37:37.000 --> 2:37:42.000]  But here's a story out of stat news from Drudge Report.
[2:37:42.000 --> 2:37:47.000]  An old school pharmacy hand delivers drugs to congress, a little known perk for the powerful.
[2:37:47.000 --> 2:37:52.000]  And it goes on that a lot of them have Alzheimer's. Yeah.
[2:37:52.000 --> 2:38:04.000]  Hey, that's a dangerous disease. My grandmother died from that. And I'm going to tell you that anyone in Congress right now suffering from that disease, I think the American people should know about that.
[2:38:04.000 --> 2:38:07.000]  I agree. What do you make of this big story?
[2:38:07.000 --> 2:38:21.000]  Well, you know, I think that, and I don't know the pharmacist and what compliance he has to have from client patient privileges, but I would assume that our government would be able to bring him behind closed doors and talk to him and say,
[2:38:21.000 --> 2:38:28.000]  we need a list of people that could possibly, you know, because there's huge responsibility for these people.
[2:38:28.000 --> 2:38:38.000]  Look, sir, they all exempted themselves from Obamacare. They exempt themselves from some taxes. The EU bureaucracy that's unelected, but just put in power and rules.
[2:38:38.000 --> 2:38:47.000]  It's tax exempt. They don't pay the same taxes that people living in EU countries do. I mean, that's what I mean about all this.
[2:38:47.000 --> 2:38:53.000]  They just hope it all stays in the bureaucracy and stays complex and we don't look at it.
[2:38:53.000 --> 2:38:58.000]  But great point. Glad you brought that up because they brought me that story about an hour ago.
[2:38:58.000 --> 2:39:06.000]  Here's another one. World War III. North Korea claims Trump has lit the wick of war threatens hail of fire.
[2:39:06.000 --> 2:39:10.000]  You know, they keep saying they're going to preemptively attack us. We're just supposed to put up with it.
[2:39:10.000 --> 2:39:24.000]  I don't want war, but I mean, it's a repulsive, evil, disgusting communist dictatorship with a third generation royal running. And I mean, I'm going to throw up.
[2:39:24.000 --> 2:39:34.000]  Harvey Weinstein had a country. Yeah, his dad used to have Japanese women kidnapped that he wanted and smuggled back so he could have sex with them.
[2:39:34.000 --> 2:39:43.000]  In a seven-story rape compound he had there in the North Korean capital. I mean, who could make that up?
[2:39:43.000 --> 2:39:51.000]  Who could make any of this stuff up? It's like, what? What? But we just put these people in power and just have them run everything.
[2:39:51.000 --> 2:39:58.000]  Thank you, Andy. You know, Joe Rogan is a great guy. I like Joe. He's really smart.
[2:39:58.000 --> 2:40:05.000]  He's been successful out, you know, on television and on UFC. That's revolutionary in a lot of ways. And then he's been in some big movies.
[2:40:05.000 --> 2:40:11.000]  And he really is critical of Hollywood a lot. He had a lot of courage exposing pedophilia and stuff when I was on his show.
[2:40:11.000 --> 2:40:15.000]  And he said, I want you to come back home for my new studio opens, but the studio hasn't opened.
[2:40:15.000 --> 2:40:21.000]  But he wanted me on September 1st, and then he just said, well, I'm a little busy maybe later.
[2:40:21.000 --> 2:40:28.000]  I don't need to go out on Joe's show to be successful. He just got a lot of heat and they did censor some of the shows over, I think, threatening.
[2:40:28.000 --> 2:40:36.000]  I'm not saying he's scared to have me on, but I'm not the person to ask to go back on Joe's show. I'll go on there anytime, anywhere I'm ready.
[2:40:36.000 --> 2:40:41.000]  And it was his number one show in history about double any other one, the number one podcast out.
[2:40:41.000 --> 2:40:48.000]  So, of course, I shouldn't come back on. I mean, if something's number one, you don't ever want to happen again. So, I understand.
[2:40:48.000 --> 2:40:53.000]  But the show definitely works together. And I'd love to have Joe on here anytime he wants to come on.
[2:40:53.000 --> 2:41:01.000]  He's a busy guy though. He does comedy a couple nights a week. There's a lot of other stuff, but there you go.
[2:41:01.000 --> 2:41:09.000]  Let's go ahead and take another call. Let's talk to Kelly in Wisconsin and Sean. Kelly, you're on the air.
[2:41:09.000 --> 2:41:11.000]  Hi, Alex. How are you today?
[2:41:11.000 --> 2:41:12.000]  I'm okay. Thank you.
[2:41:12.000 --> 2:41:18.000]  Okay. I love the fact that scripture says no weapon formed against us shall prosper.
[2:41:18.000 --> 2:41:23.000]  And I love how we get to use Facebook, Google and YouTube and turn it around on them.
[2:41:23.000 --> 2:41:24.000]  Exactly.
[2:41:24.000 --> 2:41:25.000]  Very own.
[2:41:25.000 --> 2:41:31.000]  I want to touch base on a couple of things. One, I do forensic auditing.
[2:41:31.000 --> 2:41:37.000]  And you really struck me when you were hitting yourself on the head going, wake up, wake up. Well, that happened to me.
[2:41:37.000 --> 2:41:38.000]  Really?
[2:41:38.000 --> 2:41:43.000]  A few months ago. And I'm going, this just does not make sense.
[2:41:43.000 --> 2:41:49.000]  So, what I did was I went back to the point of Hillary losing the election.
[2:41:49.000 --> 2:41:55.000]  What did Obama, what transpired from the day after Hillary lost the election?
[2:41:55.000 --> 2:41:58.000]  Because they've been in power for decades.
[2:41:58.000 --> 2:42:03.000]  They dug in. They refused to leave. They just went crazy.
[2:42:03.000 --> 2:42:12.000]  That moment, they got 72 days to clean up 20 years plus of trail.
[2:42:12.000 --> 2:42:17.000]  And how are they going to make their plan come to fruition?
[2:42:17.000 --> 2:42:20.000]  They're going to turn it around and make it an investigation about Trump.
[2:42:20.000 --> 2:42:23.000]  Well, that was a distraction. We all know that.
[2:42:23.000 --> 2:42:26.000]  But you're absolutely, your collars have been nailing it since I...
[2:42:26.000 --> 2:42:31.000]  Hold on. Hold on. I went to you late. I want to hear this, Kelly.
[2:42:31.000 --> 2:42:35.000]  I said earlier, we're like, been asleep and sleeping giant.
[2:42:35.000 --> 2:42:37.000]  And they thought if they were hitting us on the head and whipping us,
[2:42:37.000 --> 2:42:39.000]  that it was keeping us in line, we were asleep.
[2:42:39.000 --> 2:42:41.000]  But the hitting us in the head finally woke us up.
[2:42:41.000 --> 2:42:43.000]  We're like, what are you doing?
[2:42:43.000 --> 2:42:46.000]  So, that's how that works. Go back with Kelly, then Sean.
[2:42:46.000 --> 2:42:48.000]  I'm going to get to everybody here today.
[2:42:48.000 --> 2:42:50.000]  And then who we got hosting that fourth hour?
[2:42:50.000 --> 2:43:02.000]  It's going to be good. Stay with us.
[2:43:50.000 --> 2:43:55.000]  That's infowarstore.com.

[2:44:29.000 --> 2:44:31.000]  that so many other coffees give me personally.

[2:47:23.000 --> 2:47:25.000]  I'm going right back to your phone calls and more news here.
[2:47:25.000 --> 2:47:28.000]  Roger Stone's got his plate loaded, hosting the 4th hour today.
[2:47:28.000 --> 2:47:32.000]  That's coming up here in just about 10 minutes, 13 minutes on the clock.
[2:47:32.000 --> 2:47:44.000]  Just briefly, it has changed the world that individuals are funding libertarian, Americana, common sense, conservative, Christian media.
[2:47:44.000 --> 2:47:50.000]  Most of the big top grossing films now are Christian, and they're outside the Hollywood system.
[2:47:50.000 --> 2:47:54.000]  Even though they're not perfect films, nobody's perfect, it's breaking their back.
[2:47:54.000 --> 2:47:57.000]  So it's not like they're imploding, everybody else is imploding.
[2:47:57.000 --> 2:48:09.000]  Whole new systems are rising as the NFL scum, as the Hollywood trash, as the globalist controllers that use these spectacles that we thought were Americana to control us.
[2:48:09.000 --> 2:48:13.000]  They've now shown themselves they are naked enemies.
[2:48:13.000 --> 2:48:20.000]  And the libertarian revolution, the patriot revolution, the Trump revolution, helped manifest all that.
[2:48:20.000 --> 2:48:25.000]  So we can have a clear confrontation with these people.
[2:48:25.000 --> 2:48:29.000]  But as mad as they are, folks, they're planning mass murder.
[2:48:29.000 --> 2:48:31.000]  They're planning helter-skelter.
[2:48:31.000 --> 2:48:40.000]  They're planning Charlie Manson, 1969, virtual army of unidentified assassins, mass shootings, death murder.
[2:48:40.000 --> 2:48:44.000]  They thought October 1st would signal that it hasn't.
[2:48:44.000 --> 2:48:47.000]  The whole official story's collapsed there.
[2:48:47.000 --> 2:48:53.000]  So now more importantly, now more important than ever, please pray for them full wars, number one.
[2:48:53.000 --> 2:48:55.000]  Number two, spread the articles, the videos, the links.
[2:48:55.000 --> 2:48:56.000]  We're not perfect.
[2:48:56.000 --> 2:49:00.000]  We're trying hard and the information the enemy hates.
[2:49:00.000 --> 2:49:02.000]  And nothing can stop you word of mouth.
[2:49:02.000 --> 2:49:03.000]  Spread the word.
[2:49:03.000 --> 2:49:04.000]  Just keep doing it.
[2:49:04.000 --> 2:49:05.000]  It's having a huge effect.
[2:49:05.000 --> 2:49:09.000]  And also, getting a CNN is fake news shirt.
[2:49:09.000 --> 2:49:12.000]  I know you know that, but you'll meet like-minded people.
[2:49:12.000 --> 2:49:13.000]  You'll spread the word.
[2:49:13.000 --> 2:49:17.000]  You'll get out in the field, outside of cyberspace, Nazi-short network.

[2:50:19.000 --> 2:50:22.000]  Okay, let's go back to Kelly in Wisconsin.
[2:50:22.000 --> 2:50:23.000]  Thanks for holding Kelly.
[2:50:23.000 --> 2:50:24.000]  Hi.
[2:50:24.000 --> 2:50:31.000]  I wanted to point out, isn't it amazing how there's so much civil unrest and white fascism
[2:50:31.000 --> 2:50:34.000]  when Barack Obama is half-white?
[2:50:34.000 --> 2:50:40.000]  He never embraced the fact that he's half-white, and he basically stole the title.
[2:50:40.000 --> 2:50:42.000]  Which just means he's half-human anyways.
[2:50:42.000 --> 2:50:43.000]  Right.
[2:50:43.000 --> 2:50:44.000]  How is your half-black, half-white?
[2:50:44.000 --> 2:50:48.000]  It's like, you don't look at some beautiful woman that's a mulatto or whatever and say,
[2:50:48.000 --> 2:50:49.000]  she's half-black, half-white.
[2:50:49.000 --> 2:50:51.000]  That's a beautiful woman.
[2:50:51.000 --> 2:50:53.000]  I don't look at some woman who's exotic.
[2:50:53.000 --> 2:50:56.000]  You can't tell if she's Asian or Brazilian.
[2:50:56.000 --> 2:50:57.000]  You just know they're gorgeous.
[2:50:57.000 --> 2:51:01.000]  They got red blood, my dear, but go ahead.
[2:51:01.000 --> 2:51:05.000]  It's about a unifying effect that could have had on America.
[2:51:05.000 --> 2:51:09.000]  What a vehicle to unite America.
[2:51:09.000 --> 2:51:10.000]  Oh, absolutely.
[2:51:10.000 --> 2:51:11.000]  Listen, I didn't even like McCain.
[2:51:11.000 --> 2:51:12.000]  He was so bad.
[2:51:12.000 --> 2:51:13.000]  So I was neutral.
[2:51:13.000 --> 2:51:18.000]  I didn't like Obama, but I thought maybe the left at some level really does want to have unity.
[2:51:18.000 --> 2:51:24.000]  No, they use it as a weapon to make things worse, and you're absolutely right.
[2:51:24.000 --> 2:51:29.000]  Well, and Hollywood played an integral part in it because all of a sudden you came out
[2:51:29.000 --> 2:51:32.000]  with the color-paped purple, jangle and chains.
[2:51:32.000 --> 2:51:33.000]  They remade roofs.
[2:51:33.000 --> 2:51:39.000]  They made hundreds of movies that were totally historically inaccurate to exactly pouring
[2:51:39.000 --> 2:51:41.000]  salt in the wound, Kelly.
[2:51:41.000 --> 2:51:42.000]  Absolutely.
[2:51:42.000 --> 2:51:48.000]  And then they're using the music, the hip-hop, rap, the heavy metal, et cetera.
[2:51:48.000 --> 2:51:51.000]  And they do exactly what the corporate owners say.
[2:51:51.000 --> 2:51:54.000]  That's slavery.
[2:51:54.000 --> 2:51:57.000]  Everybody's enslaved by this Hollywood, and we're coming off the plantation.
[2:51:57.000 --> 2:51:58.000]  Just like Moses out of Egypt.
[2:51:58.000 --> 2:51:59.000]  God bless you, Kelly.
[2:51:59.000 --> 2:52:00.000]  Let's move to some other folks here.
[2:52:00.000 --> 2:52:01.000]  Great points.
[2:52:01.000 --> 2:52:03.000]  Hey, some folks are holding a long time.
[2:52:03.000 --> 2:52:05.000]  We can take 50 calls at a time.
[2:52:05.000 --> 2:52:08.000]  The good news is I'm taking a lot of calls today, but I'm wanting to do that.
[2:52:08.000 --> 2:52:10.000]  I'm getting better and better here, so I'm proud of that.
[2:52:10.000 --> 2:52:12.000]  Sean in, give us a little gold star.
[2:52:12.000 --> 2:52:14.000]  Sean in Pennsylvania, you're on the air.
[2:52:14.000 --> 2:52:17.000]  Thanks for holding.
[2:52:17.000 --> 2:52:18.000]  Hey, Alex.
[2:52:18.000 --> 2:52:22.000]  Thanks so much for all your products and your, for everything.
[2:52:22.000 --> 2:52:23.000]  Thank you.
[2:52:23.000 --> 2:52:27.000]  I recently stumbled onto something which I'm very ignorant on, and I'd like to take on
[2:52:27.000 --> 2:52:31.000]  it because I respect your historical knowledge, and it may touch on everything from pedophilia,
[2:52:31.000 --> 2:52:35.000]  devil worship, money manipulation, and mostly to U.S.-Russia relations.
[2:52:35.000 --> 2:52:37.000]  It's basically psychopath rule.
[2:52:37.000 --> 2:52:41.000]  So there's a lot of stuff psychopaths are into, devil worship, pedophilia, raping women.
[2:52:41.000 --> 2:52:43.000]  It's just they're, it's bad guys.
[2:52:43.000 --> 2:52:48.000]  It's, it's the real 1% are one-tenth of 1% that are genetic psychopaths.
[2:52:48.000 --> 2:52:49.000]  Go ahead.
[2:52:49.000 --> 2:52:53.000]  Can you give me some historical background or your opinion on the existence of the
[2:52:53.000 --> 2:52:56.000]  Kazarian mafia, their influence in our world today?
[2:52:56.000 --> 2:53:01.000]  And finally, are they the globalist group which was, which did not want U.S. and Russia to
[2:53:01.000 --> 2:53:06.000]  unite because through history, Russia has been the driving force against them?
[2:53:06.000 --> 2:53:10.000]  You know, there's big historical and genetic testing debate about, what was it,
[2:53:10.000 --> 2:53:13.000]  Kessler that wrote the 13th tribe?
[2:53:13.000 --> 2:53:16.000]  Is that the name of the book?
[2:53:16.000 --> 2:53:21.000]  And I read that book like 20 years ago, then I looked into even mainline study and
[2:53:21.000 --> 2:53:28.000]  they've done genetic testing of Ashkenazi Jews in Russia versus Sephardic Jews.
[2:53:28.000 --> 2:53:31.000]  And they still found that they have genetic background shared.
[2:53:31.000 --> 2:53:36.000]  But yeah, the Sephardic or the more Middle Eastern, you know, Israelis, you know,
[2:53:36.000 --> 2:53:40.000]  you see they're like, you have darker skin and always tend to like be more handsome
[2:53:40.000 --> 2:53:45.000]  and just on average, tall, dark and handsome type folks that look more Middle Eastern.
[2:53:45.000 --> 2:53:49.000]  But they still have some European background back from when what you call European,
[2:53:49.000 --> 2:53:51.000]  European stock was in the Middle East.
[2:53:51.000 --> 2:53:53.000]  And that's kind of what those tribes are.
[2:53:53.000 --> 2:53:55.000]  And it just gets really complex.
[2:53:55.000 --> 2:53:59.000]  You have what's Georgia today was the Kazarian Empire that converted to Judaism.
[2:53:59.000 --> 2:54:01.000]  That did happen.
[2:54:01.000 --> 2:54:06.000]  And then it was more kind of almost like a gypsy group almost that said they were Jewish.
[2:54:06.000 --> 2:54:08.000]  So there's some truth to that group.
[2:54:08.000 --> 2:54:11.000]  But then to say that they don't have any connection to the other group.
[2:54:11.000 --> 2:54:14.000]  When some of the Jews came to the area, they actually had intermarrying.
[2:54:14.000 --> 2:54:20.000]  It's a complex issue, but it is true that the Bolshevik Revolution,
[2:54:20.000 --> 2:54:24.000]  Alexander Sholzenitsyn wrote about this, was financed by a lot of big New York banks,
[2:54:24.000 --> 2:54:29.000]  but also the British Empire had been wanting to get rid of their Russian cousins
[2:54:29.000 --> 2:54:31.000]  that were actually German.
[2:54:31.000 --> 2:54:38.000]  So the king of England and then his Russian cousin were almost identical in the way they looked.
[2:54:38.000 --> 2:54:42.000]  They were both from the same German, Saxe-Cobart-Gotha line.
[2:54:42.000 --> 2:54:44.000]  So it's a huge historical subject.
[2:54:44.000 --> 2:54:49.000]  They've been allied with England in World War I, but then they double crossed them after World War I
[2:54:49.000 --> 2:54:53.000]  and actually wanted to get rid because England had a lot of wars with Russia.
[2:54:53.000 --> 2:54:56.000]  So it was kind of that cousins feuding.
[2:54:56.000 --> 2:55:00.000]  But it is true that there had been a lot of Jews that had come to New York
[2:55:00.000 --> 2:55:02.000]  who had thought they'd been persecuted by the Tsars,
[2:55:02.000 --> 2:55:07.000]  who when they got hired, about 100,000 mainly Jewish folks were put on ships,
[2:55:07.000 --> 2:55:12.000]  shipped over, and then hundreds of millions in gold were shizzled in mainline history
[2:55:12.000 --> 2:55:17.000]  into invade Russia with Stalin's train of gold.
[2:55:17.000 --> 2:55:21.000]  He'd been just a Russian bank robber and stuff, but he hoped to kind of run some of it
[2:55:21.000 --> 2:55:23.000]  to then overthrow Moscow itself.
[2:55:23.000 --> 2:55:27.000]  So there was that component, but you don't see that historically added
[2:55:27.000 --> 2:55:30.000]  that the British Empire was quarterbacking the operation,
[2:55:30.000 --> 2:55:37.000]  but they did use Russian-speaking Jews from London and New York City to take down Russia.
[2:55:37.000 --> 2:55:42.000]  What I was reading was that the Jewish religion was overtaken
[2:55:42.000 --> 2:55:47.000]  by a bunch of double-worshipping clans from Caesarea.
[2:55:47.000 --> 2:55:52.000]  No, no, no. People always conflate things. It's not that simple.
[2:55:52.000 --> 2:55:56.000]  You have the Babylonian captivity that happened twice,
[2:55:56.000 --> 2:56:00.000]  and you had other captivity where the Jews were like super right-wing straight up,
[2:56:00.000 --> 2:56:05.000]  and then they got captured by the Babylonians and then wrote a bunch of new,
[2:56:05.000 --> 2:56:08.000]  not the Torah, that's the Bible, the whole Testament,
[2:56:08.000 --> 2:56:12.000]  and then we have the Christian, you know, Second Testament to that,
[2:56:12.000 --> 2:56:16.000]  so the merger of Judaism and Christianity there in Christ's new deal.
[2:56:16.000 --> 2:56:21.000]  But if you look at what happened with the Babylonian captivity and others,
[2:56:21.000 --> 2:56:25.000]  then that's when they came out with these new books and a lot of things,
[2:56:25.000 --> 2:56:29.000]  and that's where the occult came from, not from the Georgians.
[2:56:29.000 --> 2:56:36.000]  Do you think that some of this occult stuff that remains is what's taking over some of our government?
[2:56:36.000 --> 2:56:38.000]  I don't want to say it's a Jewish-Satanic conspiracy.
[2:56:38.000 --> 2:56:41.000]  Before Christianity, everything was occult.
[2:56:41.000 --> 2:56:43.000]  They were doing human sacrifices, bro.
[2:56:43.000 --> 2:56:49.000]  You know, the year 2000, nobody's seen a Jew in England or whatever,
[2:56:49.000 --> 2:56:58.000]  every culture from the Aztecs to the Celts, to the Britis, to the Visigoths, to the Astragoths,
[2:56:58.000 --> 2:57:03.000]  to every tribe was human sacrifice, and it depended in time,
[2:57:03.000 --> 2:57:07.000]  whether you were in the Pacific Ocean or whether you were in ancient China or Africa,
[2:57:07.000 --> 2:57:10.000]  people were shrinking heads, drinking blood, cutting hearts out.
[2:57:10.000 --> 2:57:13.000]  There's always been psychopath groups that get in charge and do that,
[2:57:13.000 --> 2:57:16.000]  but absolutely, the media will cut this out of context, I don't care,
[2:57:16.000 --> 2:57:20.000]  absolutely, after the Babylonian captivity and other things,
[2:57:20.000 --> 2:57:27.000]  Judaism then, in some of its sects, adopted what you'd call classical black arts.
[2:57:27.000 --> 2:57:30.000]  But then you could argue Masonic stuff is that,
[2:57:30.000 --> 2:57:33.000]  going back to Solomon's temple and all the wives he took on,
[2:57:33.000 --> 2:57:35.000]  and you can say that Judaism was corrupted at that point.
[2:57:35.000 --> 2:57:39.000]  But I mean, every culture has been quote-corrupted by the occult,
[2:57:39.000 --> 2:57:41.000]  because it's all that existed pre-Christ.
[2:57:41.000 --> 2:57:44.000]  We'll be back. Ladies and gentlemen, stay with us.
[2:57:44.000 --> 2:57:49.000]  As most of you already know, I am a voracious consumer of news and information.
[2:57:49.000 --> 2:57:52.000]  And in the last four or five years doing more and more research,
[2:57:52.000 --> 2:57:57.000]  I came across the fact that the elite establishment is fully aware of the fact
[2:57:57.000 --> 2:58:02.000]  that our ancient ancestors, in many cases, had much better nutrition than we do today.
[2:58:02.000 --> 2:58:06.000]  And our ancient ancestors sought out the bones of the animals
[2:58:06.000 --> 2:58:09.000]  that they were hunting, killing, and then processing.
[2:58:09.000 --> 2:58:15.000]  And so I set out to develop Caveman, but to not just have concentrated bone broth from chicken,
[2:58:15.000 --> 2:58:23.000]  but seven other superfood ingredients known for cleansing and supercharging the body at the same time.
[2:58:23.000 --> 2:58:25.000]  Info wars isn't just fighting the globalist.
[2:58:25.000 --> 2:58:30.000]  We're getting results, and we're expanding in the face of the complete media assault
[2:58:30.000 --> 2:58:33.000]  and winning because of your support.
[2:58:33.000 --> 2:58:36.000]  Caveman is back in stock. People absolutely love it.
[2:58:36.000 --> 2:58:40.000]  So please secure your caveman today at infowarslife.com
[2:58:40.000 --> 2:58:45.000]  or by calling toll free triple A 253 3139.
[2:58:45.000 --> 2:58:50.000]  Please listen carefully because I'm about to point out three things that will save you a lot of money
[2:58:50.000 --> 2:58:54.000]  while you get high quality products and fund the Info War, a 360 win.
[2:58:54.000 --> 2:59:01.000]  Number one, when you choose auto ship before checkout, we give you 10% off on your order at infowarsore.com.
[2:59:01.000 --> 2:59:06.000]  Number two, you're also able to get items that are out of stock when you sign up for auto ship
[2:59:06.000 --> 2:59:09.000]  because we hold back a surplus for auto ship customers.
[2:59:09.000 --> 2:59:14.000]  Number three, we're giving you free shipping on all orders above $50.
[2:59:14.000 --> 2:59:20.000]  Listeners have been requesting this for years because it's so easy to forget to reorder the products that you need each month.
[2:59:20.000 --> 2:59:24.000]  Just go to infowarsore.com, select your favorite product or products.

[2:59:28.000 --> 2:59:35.000]  As you know, I coined the term 360 win and with the new auto ship feature at infowarslife.com, this is a sure win.
[2:59:35.000 --> 2:59:41.000]  10% off on auto ship, win win win at infowarslife.com, free shipping on orders above $50.
[2:59:41.000 --> 3:00:09.000]  And all auto stock items are never out of stock when you sign up for auto ship.
[3:00:09.000 --> 3:00:19.000]  Waging war on corruption is Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the info war.
[3:00:19.000 --> 3:00:28.000]  A caller earlier asked me, is the Satanism we see in America a product of Judaism?
[3:00:28.000 --> 3:00:40.000]  And the answer is yes and no. What is Satanism? It's the love of the psychopathic rule of the sociopath's kingdom.
[3:00:40.000 --> 3:00:45.000]  So you've got psychopaths on top of sociopaths serving them.
[3:00:45.000 --> 3:00:56.000]  But if you go back to Abraham and Jacob when he's going to sacrifice his son and then God states his hand and probably put an engraving of that image up,
[3:00:56.000 --> 3:01:06.000]  that's what every culture from China to Mesoamerica at that time, 3,000 plus years ago, everyone was killing their children.
[3:01:06.000 --> 3:01:12.000]  Everyone was slitting their throats, generally of the king or the nobleman's firstborn son.
[3:01:12.000 --> 3:01:18.000]  Oh, the royalty had to kill their children in Mesoamerica and in what's the Middle East today.
[3:01:18.000 --> 3:01:27.000]  And it was the Jews in the first to write it, some cultures didn't do it as well, to say we're going to stop killing people.
[3:01:27.000 --> 3:01:33.000]  We'll kill some doves or some rams and eat them or maybe a cow.
[3:01:33.000 --> 3:01:40.000]  So then you ask me, are the Jews the devil worshipers? They're the first group to at least to write it down to say, let's stop doing this.
[3:01:40.000 --> 3:01:45.000]  Because it was going on all around them. Then they wage war, people say, oh God, the Jews were exterminating everybody.
[3:01:45.000 --> 3:01:51.000]  If you did human sacrifice, they would kill everybody. The Bible, Old Testament says, kill everybody that kills kids.
[3:01:51.000 --> 3:01:55.000]  They put their kids to the fires of Moloch, kill them all.
[3:01:55.000 --> 3:02:03.000]  So this isn't a defense of Judaism or an attack on it, it's a defense of history.
[3:02:03.000 --> 3:02:10.000]  And so I know it's a big white supremacist thing that Jews invented devil worship and that Jews do black Sabbaths.
[3:02:10.000 --> 3:02:16.000]  They've had Jews do black Sabbaths that have been caught, they've had Catholics caught, they've had Protestants caught.
[3:02:16.000 --> 3:02:22.000]  Black Sabbaths are a bunch of self-centered bad people wanting to kill men, women or children and have power.
[3:02:22.000 --> 3:02:29.000]  They don't want to go hunt elk in the mountains, they don't want to go arm wrestle, they don't want to have Jiu Jitsu, they don't want to go join the military and fight other men.
[3:02:29.000 --> 3:02:36.000]  They want to be in a cult of creepy guys and have their way with people.
[3:02:36.000 --> 3:02:46.000]  And you know, that's how I know humans are humans. Whether it was Africa or whether it was Asia or whether it was Latin America, Mesoamerica or ancient white Europe.
[3:02:46.000 --> 3:02:52.000]  Everybody burned people to death, everybody ate hearts, everybody did that stuff.
[3:02:52.000 --> 3:02:55.000]  And it's all about proving you're the toughest, you're the best.
[3:02:55.000 --> 3:03:00.000]  And scaring everybody else in the village through terror that you're the boss.
[3:03:00.000 --> 3:03:07.000]  And finally, after terror, people accepted and it becomes their religion.
[3:03:07.000 --> 3:03:21.000]  And so Judaism first rejected what was going on in Babylon and going on in Persia and going on in Egypt and going on in Greece to a certain extent.
[3:03:21.000 --> 3:03:23.000]  Greece wasn't as corrupt.
[3:03:23.000 --> 3:03:26.000]  Just if they disagreed whether they just throw it off a cliff, it was really human sacrifice.
[3:03:26.000 --> 3:03:31.000]  And they had some human sacrifice. It was more like, you know, throw your five-year-old out in the woods for a year and see if they come back.
[3:03:31.000 --> 3:03:34.000]  It was more like that. That's where eugenics came from.
[3:03:34.000 --> 3:03:36.000]  At least we're like, oh, this is what we're going to do.
[3:03:36.000 --> 3:03:40.000]  We don't just cut people's hearts off for no reason. We just kill all the weak people.
[3:03:40.000 --> 3:03:47.000]  And you know, so there's just a lot of complex history and people tend to dumb it all down.
[3:03:47.000 --> 3:03:50.000]  And what I gave you is just a snapshot, just told.
[3:03:50.000 --> 3:03:57.000]  And it doesn't mean people are like, wow, Mr. Fancy Pan has told us all that history. It's not. It's interesting.
[3:03:57.000 --> 3:04:00.000]  I mean, how could you quit wanting to know all this?
[3:04:00.000 --> 3:04:03.000]  Roger Stone's coming up and I know he loves phone calls.
[3:04:03.000 --> 3:04:06.000]  If you want to hold for him, I bet he'll go to your Jeff in North Carolina.
[3:04:06.000 --> 3:04:08.000]  Just ask Stone, I'm sure he will.
[3:04:08.000 --> 3:04:10.000]  And Jesse and Mike, I got a bunch of stuff to handle.
[3:04:10.000 --> 3:04:15.000]  I'm busier than a one-legged man in an ass-whooping contest.
[3:04:15.000 --> 3:04:20.000]  So we're going to be ending my part of the transmission here in about 30 seconds.
[3:04:20.000 --> 3:04:24.000]  Please spread the links. Please pray for the operation. There's a reason the enemy hates us.
[3:04:24.000 --> 3:04:28.000]  We're not devil worshipers. We want you to succeed and we want to succeed.
[3:04:28.000 --> 3:04:31.000]  And as long as you want to succeed and don't want to get in our way, we'll support you.
[3:04:31.000 --> 3:04:35.000]  If you want to get in our way and try to hurt us, well, we're going to go through you.
[3:04:35.000 --> 3:04:41.000]  Not because we're tough guys or want to be in charge, but because we're not going to let you run our lives.
[3:04:41.000 --> 3:04:45.000]  It's the Great Animating Contest of Liberty. It's happening now.
[3:04:45.000 --> 3:04:49.000]  And humanity is beginning to rise as the spirit of liberty comes back into the world.
[3:04:49.000 --> 3:04:52.000]  We'll be right back, sailors.
[3:04:54.000 --> 3:04:58.000]  All the perplexities, the confusion and distress in America arise,
[3:04:58.000 --> 3:05:02.000]  not from objects in their constitution or confederation,
[3:05:02.000 --> 3:05:06.000]  not from want of honor or virtue, so much as from the downright ignorance
[3:05:06.000 --> 3:05:09.000]  of the nature of coin, credit and circulation.
[3:05:09.000 --> 3:05:13.000]  Those are the words of John Adams, the second president of the United States.
[3:05:13.000 --> 3:05:18.000]  Are you ignorant of the private Federal Reserve? Do you understand the nature of our fiat currency?
[3:05:18.000 --> 3:05:25.000]  Do you understand how a private corporation has the ability to create boom and bust cycles and to profit from it?
[3:05:25.000 --> 3:05:30.000]  What kind of leverage do these people and the Federal Reserve have over the American people?
[3:05:30.000 --> 3:05:34.000]  Or for that matter, what kind of leverage do the Saudis have over our money?
[3:05:34.000 --> 3:05:39.000]  Will you be a slave or will you be free? Adams also said liberty cannot be preserved
[3:05:39.000 --> 3:05:43.000]  without general knowledge among the people. Join the Infowars.
[3:05:43.000 --> 3:05:46.000]  Spread the information. Educate yourself and others.
[3:05:46.000 --> 3:05:48.000]  The truth shall set you free.
[3:05:48.000 --> 3:06:12.000]  From the Frontlines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[3:06:18.000 --> 3:06:28.000]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, Alex Jones here back live.
[3:06:28.000 --> 3:06:34.000]  Alex Jones here back live. I was about to punch out and turn the operation over to Roger Stone,
[3:06:34.000 --> 3:06:37.000]  but I'm going to be co-hosting with here for a few minutes.
[3:06:37.000 --> 3:06:44.000]  And Nico Acosta, the main producer, came over to me and said,
[3:06:44.000 --> 3:06:48.000]  Alex, look at this. They're not even trying anymore.
[3:06:48.000 --> 3:06:57.000]  Anderson Cooper has come out and attacked yours truly and claimed that I fabricated the Soros Nazi ties.
[3:06:57.000 --> 3:07:05.000]  Now, this is like 11 days ago, they announced ISIS claim responsibility for the Las Vegas attack.
[3:07:05.000 --> 3:07:16.000]  And the next day, Newsweek and Solon and hundreds of fake news publications said that I had just made up ISIS declaring responsibility.
[3:07:16.000 --> 3:07:20.000]  They didn't say, oh, ISIS made it up. They just said I made it up.
[3:07:20.000 --> 3:07:26.000]  So they're attempting to brand me as the guy that makes things up.
[3:07:26.000 --> 3:07:37.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, Soros on 60 Minutes and on Lair NewsHour, and they were able to expose the Lair NewsHour footage,
[3:07:37.000 --> 3:07:43.000]  admitted that he collaborated with the Nazis and said he wasn't ashamed of it.
[3:07:43.000 --> 3:07:50.000]  George Soros admittedly with his uncle helped round up thousands of people because he was Jewish
[3:07:50.000 --> 3:07:58.000]  and they trusted him, people in the same vein as Anne Frank, and he would round them up and he said he wasn't ashamed of it because it was like free markets.
[3:07:58.000 --> 3:08:02.000]  If he wouldn't have helped round them up, someone else wouldn't have done it.
[3:08:02.000 --> 3:08:10.000]  I mean, he admits this in books written about him. This is next level.
[3:08:10.000 --> 3:08:13.000]  This is next level.
[3:08:13.000 --> 3:08:19.000]  So here is Anderson Cooper saying I made this up.
[3:08:19.000 --> 3:08:36.000]  He's saying I made up Austin, Texas existing, or George Washington existing, or Pontius Pilot existing, or Obama, or Hillary.
[3:08:36.000 --> 3:08:48.000]  I mean, or Donald Trump. It's so crazy, the articles on InfoWars.com, to have them deny what he says on a video, but here's the difference.
[3:08:48.000 --> 3:08:54.000]  Every time we try to upload this, they go, oh, you copyright violation, CBS 60 Minutes.
[3:08:54.000 --> 3:09:06.000]  We have full fair use under all law, open and shut case, no debate, that if we're talking about George Soros and playing a clip of him saying it under political purposes, it's 100% covered,
[3:09:06.000 --> 3:09:10.000]  especially when they're saying I'm lying about it.
[3:09:10.000 --> 3:09:18.000]  So everyone take this video, everyone show this to people, because this is fake news, Waterloo. They know they're liars.
[3:09:18.000 --> 3:09:20.000]  They know they're caught.
[3:09:20.000 --> 3:09:28.000]  And they've got this cosmetic job going for George Soros, who did the Arab Spring that killed over a million people, that helped overthrow Ukraine.
[3:09:28.000 --> 3:09:31.000]  I mean, this guy's a monster.
[3:09:31.000 --> 3:09:36.000]  They got arrest warrants out for him in like 10 countries.
[3:09:36.000 --> 3:09:42.000]  They're telling you he never tried to crash the pound. He never over through African countries. He never funded radical Islamists.
[3:09:42.000 --> 3:09:48.000]  He's not buddies with Weinstein. He's not buddies with the Clintons. He's not coming after your guns. No.
[3:09:48.000 --> 3:09:56.000]  CNN says it's fake news, and now CNN wants to ban any YouTube or Facebook channel that says it. That's why they're doing it.
[3:09:56.000 --> 3:10:03.000]  Well, the CNN Politifact says all 16 intelligence agencies say the Russians did it.
[3:10:03.000 --> 3:10:10.000]  Now they admit none of it. It was all a lie. This is just total fraud. So here it is, ladies and gentlemen.
[3:10:10.000 --> 3:10:15.000]  It was that way. The consequences could be literally millions of deaths.
[3:10:15.000 --> 3:10:18.000]  Tony Schwartz appreciated by Meg Haverman as well.
[3:10:18.000 --> 3:10:21.000]  Up next, another white supremacist rally in Charlottesville this past weekend.
[3:10:21.000 --> 3:10:25.000]  And something else caught our attention. One of them were out protesting the white supremacists.
[3:10:25.000 --> 3:10:30.000]  As disgusting as both rallies were, there was something else that caught our eye when it posted this past Friday.
[3:10:30.000 --> 3:10:36.000]  It's the claim that the August protest, the one that killed Ms. Hyer, was some sort of left-wing plot.
[3:10:36.000 --> 3:10:42.000]  Now who, you might ask, would say something so offensive and disgusting as that? Some shock-jock radio personality maybe?
[3:10:42.000 --> 3:10:46.000]  No. An elected representative who's serving right now in the U.S. Congress.
[3:10:46.000 --> 3:10:50.000]  Here he is, two-term Arizona Congressman Paul Gosar.
[3:10:50.000 --> 3:10:55.000]  Now, here's exactly what the Congressman said to Vice News Correspondent Ellie Reeve.
[3:10:55.000 --> 3:11:02.000]  Let's look at the person that actually started the rally. It's come to our attention that this is a person from Occupy Wall Street
[3:11:02.000 --> 3:11:08.000]  that was an Obama sympathizer. So, wait a minute. Be careful over which area you start taking these people to.
[3:11:08.000 --> 3:11:14.000]  And look at the background. George Soros is one of those people that actually helps back these individuals.
[3:11:14.000 --> 3:11:21.000]  Who is he? I think he's from Hungary. I think he was Jewish and I think he turned in his own people to the Nazis.
[3:11:21.000 --> 3:11:28.000]  Be very careful over where we go with those. Do you think George Soros funded the neo-Nazis who marched in Charleston?
[3:11:28.000 --> 3:11:31.000]  Wouldn't it be interesting to find out?
[3:11:31.000 --> 3:11:38.000]  Again, that was Republican Arizona Congressman Paul Gosar. This man, keeping him on us, does he have proof?
[3:11:38.000 --> 3:11:43.000]  No, nothing. In other words, it's a false flag. He's spreading and insulting and disgusting conspiracy theory.
[3:11:43.000 --> 3:11:48.000]  One that's been swiftly debunked by many. We asked Congressman Gosar to come on the program tonight. His office declined.
[3:11:48.000 --> 3:11:51.000]  We told them it's an open invitation. We got no reply.
[3:11:51.000 --> 3:11:55.000]  These conspiracy theories were first spread by radio talk show host Alex Jones.
[3:11:55.000 --> 3:12:02.000]  The rally in August was organized by Jason Kessler who said he voted for President Obama and attended one Occupy event.
[3:12:02.000 --> 3:12:05.000]  But he also says he became disenchanted with the Obama administration.
[3:12:05.000 --> 3:12:08.000]  And in addition to organizing that hate-filled show...
[3:12:08.000 --> 3:12:13.000]  All three of the organizers were funded by leftist groups and they had hired actors admitted.
[3:12:13.000 --> 3:12:17.000]  I'm not saying there wasn't real killing, but let's go further here.
[3:12:17.000 --> 3:12:22.000]  They're trying to sit there and imply...
[3:12:22.000 --> 3:12:26.000]  I'm actually speechless at this point. I mean, this is next level.
[3:12:26.000 --> 3:12:34.000]  That Cooper knows full well that Soros has admitted to being a Nazi collaborator and they're now saying that's a conspiracy theorist.
[3:12:34.000 --> 3:12:42.000]  And notice, again, they take whatever's our strongest information and they act like they've caught us in something so people stop saying it.
[3:12:42.000 --> 3:12:49.000]  They take whatever's our strongest thing like the sky's blue, the sun's yellow. They laugh at us hoping we quit, hoping we stop doing it.
[3:12:49.000 --> 3:13:14.000]  That's why they tell these ball-faced lies. Let's continue.
[3:13:14.000 --> 3:13:20.000]  He was 14 years old when the war ended. He did not collaborate with the Nazis. He did not help round up people.
[3:13:20.000 --> 3:13:24.000]  He did not confiscate anybody's property. Joining me now is Ellie Reeves.
[3:13:24.000 --> 3:13:26.000]  She's the Vice News reporter who did that interview.
[3:13:26.000 --> 3:13:28.000]  That's enough. And then who's this woman?
[3:13:28.000 --> 3:13:34.000]  He says he collaborated with Nazis and she responds, oh, he funded neo-Nazis?
[3:13:34.000 --> 3:13:38.000]  And I'm sorry, they've hired her because she looks like...
[3:13:38.000 --> 3:13:48.000]  I'm sad. I mean, I'm kind of glad. I actually want to honor Vice hiring disabled people to be the reporters, but I mean, this is next level, folks.
[3:13:48.000 --> 3:13:57.000]  So here's actually George Soros on 60 Minutes saying he's not even ashamed of it that he helped the Nazis. Here it is.
[3:13:57.000 --> 3:14:03.000]  These are pictures from 1944 of what happened to George Soros' friends and neighbors.
[3:14:03.000 --> 3:14:12.000]  You're a Hungarian Jew who escaped the Holocaust by posing as a Christian.
[3:14:12.000 --> 3:14:18.000]  And you watched lots of people get shipped off to the death camps.
[3:14:18.000 --> 3:14:24.000]  I was 14 years old and I would say that that's what my character was made.
[3:14:24.000 --> 3:14:30.000]  It was a tremendous threat of evil. I mean, it was a very personal experience of evil.
[3:14:30.000 --> 3:14:39.000]  My understanding is that you went out with this protector of yours who swore that you were his adopted god son.
[3:14:39.000 --> 3:14:40.000]  Yes, yes.
[3:14:40.000 --> 3:14:44.000]  Went out, in fact, and helped in the confiscation of property from the Jews.
[3:14:44.000 --> 3:14:45.000]  That's right.
[3:14:45.000 --> 3:14:54.000]  I mean, that sounds like an experience that would send lots of people to the psychiatric couch for many, many years.
[3:14:54.000 --> 3:14:59.000]  Was it difficult? Not at all.
[3:14:59.000 --> 3:15:06.000]  It was actually probably the happiest year of my life, that year of German occupation.
[3:15:06.000 --> 3:15:13.000]  Now, that's just one clip. I want to add to this or get McBrain to give it to you because it's like a 15-minute interview on there.
[3:15:13.000 --> 3:15:21.000]  He says it taught me about markets and if I wouldn't have helped round these people up, someone else would have done it.
[3:15:21.000 --> 3:15:26.000]  So I know he wants to explain to the interview, maybe tomorrow we should air the whole thing on air,
[3:15:26.000 --> 3:15:30.000]  but for some reason we never play the real coup de grace.
[3:15:30.000 --> 3:15:39.000]  Metaphysical? Not meant to happen? Who knows, but something tells me someday it will air.
[3:15:39.000 --> 3:15:43.000]  Someday, maybe today's that day.
[3:15:43.000 --> 3:15:50.000]  We refresh your breath with Emmerich's Essentials Organic Mouthwash.

[3:18:15.000 --> 3:18:22.000]  It is perfect for freeze drying fruits, vegetables, meats, dairy products, desserts, and entire meals.
[3:18:22.000 --> 3:18:32.000]  That's what I'm talking about. When compared to traditional methods of preservation, like canning or dehydrating, like what you get at the grocery store, there is no comparison.
[3:18:32.000 --> 3:18:41.000]  Harvestrite freeze dryers retain 97% of the food's taste, color, and nutritional value and have a shelf life of up to 25 years.
[3:18:41.000 --> 3:18:49.000]  Now that's what I call the miracle of food preservation. Harvestrite is truly the world's best, most affordable freeze dryer.
[3:18:49.000 --> 3:18:53.000]  So what are you waiting for? Check it out right now at infowarstore.com.
[3:18:54.000 --> 3:19:01.000]  Thousands of years ago there was a basic form of chivalry. Our ancestors would hear the drums of war.
[3:19:01.000 --> 3:19:06.000]  Giving the warriors of the tribe a chance to organize and prepare a defense.
[3:19:06.000 --> 3:19:15.000]  60 years ago, when foreign air forces were approaching filled with bombs, they had drums of their own, air raid sirens.
[3:19:15.000 --> 3:19:19.000]  But in the 21st century, there were silent weapons for quiet war.
[3:19:19.000 --> 3:19:29.000]  Pathogens added to the food and water, and to the lining of plastics that destroy our vitality, turn off our hormones, and accelerate our journey towards death.
[3:19:29.000 --> 3:19:32.000]  I personally counter this onslaught with Anthroplex.
[3:19:32.000 --> 3:19:43.000]  Anthroplex is designed with known, organic, concentrated herbs to create the basic foundation to normal metabolic activity inside the human body.
[3:19:43.000 --> 3:19:46.000]  Discover why Anthroplex has turned so many heads today.
[3:19:46.000 --> 3:20:03.000]  It's time for us to take our bodies back into our own hands, and it starts at infowarstore.com with Anthroplex.
[3:20:03.000 --> 3:20:07.000]  My understanding is that you went out with this protector of yours.
[3:20:07.000 --> 3:20:08.000]  Yes, yes.
[3:20:08.000 --> 3:20:12.000]  Went out, in fact, and helped in the confiscation of property from the Jews.
[3:20:12.000 --> 3:20:13.000]  That's right.
[3:20:13.000 --> 3:20:15.000]  That's right.
[3:20:15.000 --> 3:20:18.000]  Was it difficult?
[3:20:18.000 --> 3:20:20.000]  Not at all.
[3:20:20.000 --> 3:20:21.000]  Not at all.
[3:20:21.000 --> 3:20:25.000]  Maybe as a child, you don't see the connection.
[3:20:25.000 --> 3:20:28.000]  It created no problem at all.
[3:20:28.000 --> 3:20:29.000]  No feeling of guilt?
[3:20:29.000 --> 3:20:30.000]  No.
[3:20:30.000 --> 3:20:40.000]  Well, actually, in a funny way, it's just like in markets, that if I weren't there, somebody else would be taking it away anyhow.
[3:20:40.000 --> 3:20:45.000]  Whether I was there or not, the property was being taken away.
[3:20:45.000 --> 3:20:47.000]  So I had no sense of guilt.
[3:20:47.000 --> 3:20:52.000]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign, and domestic.
[3:20:52.000 --> 3:20:54.000]  It's Alex Jones.
[3:20:58.000 --> 3:21:01.000]  By the way, the article's up on infowarstore.com.
[3:21:01.000 --> 3:21:07.000]  CNN now claims that George Soros was not a Nazi collaborator, and that we have made it up.
[3:21:07.000 --> 3:21:13.000]  The full, was it 14-minute interview he did for 60 Minutes, is posted in our article.
[3:21:13.000 --> 3:21:15.000]  This is next-level BS.
[3:21:15.000 --> 3:21:17.000]  Now, I'm going to turn the show over to Roger Shubins.
[3:21:17.000 --> 3:21:22.000]  He's got a congressman coming on with huge groundbreaking news and information.
[3:21:22.000 --> 3:21:24.000]  I'm going to turn this over right now, Roger, but just briefly.
[3:21:24.000 --> 3:21:35.000]  What do you make of CNN's latest venture into complete fairy tale fake news, defending a Nazi collaborator, and saying that I made it up?
[3:21:35.000 --> 3:21:38.000]  What in the world is going on?
[3:21:38.000 --> 3:21:41.000]  This is the epitome of fake news.
[3:21:41.000 --> 3:21:46.000]  You know, I used to like Anderson Cooper, but this is a bridge too far.
[3:21:46.000 --> 3:21:52.000]  Reminds me of a piece of legislation that Congressman Adam Schiff introduced last week, Alex,
[3:21:52.000 --> 3:22:01.000]  which declares that the federal government has never paid out a penny to anyone who was damaged by vaccines.
[3:22:01.000 --> 3:22:06.000]  But we know that that's false. They've paid out almost $3.7 billion.
[3:22:06.000 --> 3:22:10.000]  It's the same kind of denial that you see here.
[3:22:10.000 --> 3:22:17.000]  It is widely established that Soros was a Nazi collaborator.
[3:22:17.000 --> 3:22:24.000]  He is, as you can see, he exudes absolute stone-cold evil.
[3:22:24.000 --> 3:22:33.000]  And foreign intelligence services in numerous countries have documented his Nazi collaboration.
[3:22:33.000 --> 3:22:43.000]  So this is an attempt by CNN, not a news organization, to reinvent history, to bury the truth with the big lie.
[3:22:43.000 --> 3:22:47.000]  This is a classic of the big lie technique.
[3:22:47.000 --> 3:22:50.000]  And Alex, I'm a little jealous because they're blaming you.
[3:22:50.000 --> 3:22:56.000]  Roger, how do you get a big show? Sorry, I got in. Please take it over at StoneColdTrip.com.
[3:22:56.000 --> 3:23:02.000]  No problem at all. This, I think, was, in fact, extremely newsworthy, Alex.
[3:23:02.000 --> 3:23:11.000]  I have never seen CNN go quite this far in their Orwellian attempts to deny reality.
[3:23:11.000 --> 3:23:24.000]  There is more and more reports from the Trump White House about discord between the president and his chief of staff, General John Kelly.
[3:23:24.000 --> 3:23:37.000]  Jack Pasobek, who often appears here at InfoWars, reported several days ago that Kelly had tendered his resignation some weeks ago.
[3:23:37.000 --> 3:23:42.000]  Now, I've seen this bureaucratic trick before.
[3:23:42.000 --> 3:23:50.000]  Under Richard Nixon, Henry Kissinger tendered his resignation roughly once every 10 days.
[3:23:50.000 --> 3:23:55.000]  Al Haig, later the White House chief of staff, picked up this same technique.
[3:23:55.000 --> 3:24:01.000]  They're not really quitting, you understand, and they don't want the president to take them up on their offer.
[3:24:01.000 --> 3:24:05.000]  It's an attempt to pressure the president.
[3:24:05.000 --> 3:24:24.000]  What I can report is that Kelly has done an effective job of bringing down a de facto iron curtain around our president, controlling all written and human communications that reach the president from the outside.
[3:24:24.000 --> 3:24:37.000]  With the exception of those communications that are engendered when the president picks up the phone or when he asks for a specific piece of information.
[3:24:37.000 --> 3:24:55.000]  Now, it seems to me that there was an important piece in Vanity Fair today by Gabriel Sherman, who, to my mind, is one of the better political reporters in Washington and the Washington, New York access.
[3:24:55.000 --> 3:25:13.000]  And in this piece, Sherman correctly points out that the season, meaning winter, when the beautiful people, when high society goes to Palm Beach, is going to pose a specific challenge to General Kelly.
[3:25:13.000 --> 3:25:18.000]  You see, the president is an extraordinarily social animal.
[3:25:18.000 --> 3:25:27.000]  He, unlike Hillary Clinton, he actually likes people. He likes to mix with them. He likes to talk to them. He likes to get ideas from them.
[3:25:27.000 --> 3:25:36.000]  He likes to bounce his ideas off of them and see what they think. He's a gregarious extrovert in an extrovert's job.
[3:25:36.000 --> 3:25:54.000]  And when he goes to his stunning compound in Palm Beach, the Marlago Club, well, on any given night, you can find him in the dining room holding court, meeting with friends old and new and really very much in his element.
[3:25:54.000 --> 3:26:13.000]  The problem with that, of course, is that it violates the new protocols set up by General Kelly. The idea of taking the president to this palatial private club where he has an embedded residence, kind of a luxury apartment,
[3:26:13.000 --> 3:26:21.000]  but separating him from his many friends and guests, well, that will be a very, very tall order.
[3:26:21.000 --> 3:26:36.000]  For example, the conservative publisher, Christopher Ruddy, a friend of Info Wars, a friend of mine, a member of the Marlago Club, someone often seen at the president's elbow in the wintertime.
[3:26:36.000 --> 3:26:44.000]  I could name others. In fact, I wouldn't be shocked if Alex Jones and Roger Stone show up for dinner one night.
[3:26:44.000 --> 3:26:56.000]  So General Kelly's work is really cut out for him. The president is not like some child going to be kept in the dark and fed disinformation.
[3:26:56.000 --> 3:27:04.000]  That's not the Donald Trump that I know. Keep an eye on General Kelly.
[3:27:04.000 --> 3:27:15.000]  I don't know that he'll be there after February. You can only pull the I quit. I'm tendering my resignation act so many times.
[3:27:15.000 --> 3:27:21.000]  I think it is likely that the good general will overplay his hand.
[3:27:21.000 --> 3:27:40.000]  Since you're with us here at Info Wars, I'd really appreciate it. Personally, if you go to the InfoWars.com store where they have an extraordinary special on brain force, I would have to say all the products available in the entire InfoWars.com line.
[3:27:40.000 --> 3:27:53.000]  This is without any question my favorite. For me, it gives me mental clarity, mental organization, mental energy as it were. Kind of helps you collect your thoughts and focus them.
[3:27:53.000 --> 3:28:06.000]  This is a terrific product. I can tell you firsthand that it works because I was writing last night till almost 3 a.m. got up this morning for early meetings.
[3:28:06.000 --> 3:28:11.000]  Here I am on InfoWars now and in the next hour.
[3:28:11.000 --> 3:28:25.000]  Speaking of the rest of our show, Congressman Matt Gates of Florida will join us to talk about Attorney General Jeff Sessions and why there has been no examination of the Clinton Foundation.
[3:28:25.000 --> 3:28:52.000]  I'm Roger Stone and I'll be right back.
[3:28:52.000 --> 3:28:57.000]  Not a group you developed living defense for us. It took you over a year to do it. Why is this so good?
[3:28:57.000 --> 3:29:08.000]  Because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most. I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in my system.
[3:29:08.000 --> 3:29:22.000]  Right now we're dealing with massive parasites, which is anything that's harmful to your body that lives off a host mechanism right now with all the refugees spreading disease around. We have biological warfare going on everywhere.
[3:29:22.000 --> 3:29:26.000]  These are all parasites. Tell us about all the stuff that says there's so many things that are in it.
[3:29:26.000 --> 3:29:34.000]  You have the neem in there. You have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood. I recommend doing a parasite cleanse at least twice a year.
[3:29:34.000 --> 3:29:40.000]  All right, well, I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today. It just came back in yesterday. Living Defense, infowarslife.com.
[3:29:40.000 --> 3:29:47.000]  And folks, you can't lose full of stuff that's great for your body, period. And you support the broadcast, infowarslife.com.

[3:31:32.000 --> 3:31:42.000]  Super Blue Fluoride Free Mouthwash and Toothpaste are the first and only to contain all of these natural ingredients. Xylitol, nano-silver, and iodine.

[3:32:06.000 --> 3:32:20.000]  The same team based right here in America that brought you the Alexa Pure Groundbreaking Water Filtration Systems have now developed Alexa Pure Breeze. Whether it's your home or office, you owe it to yourself, your coworkers, your family, your children.

[3:32:32.000 --> 3:32:47.000]  The Alexa Pure Breeze would be a steal at $300, $400, $500. One of these systems can keep 800 square feet incredibly clean. This is a system I'm personally putting in throughout my house, replacing older, more expensive filters that didn't do as good a job.
[3:32:47.000 --> 3:33:03.000]  Find out why this system is so revolutionary today and then for our store.com.
[3:33:03.000 --> 3:33:22.000]  Hi, this is former mayor and the greatest mayor, Mr. Ryan Eleven, Rudy Giuliani, and you're listening to Roger Stone on Infowars.
[3:33:33.000 --> 3:33:53.000]  Welcome back. I'm Roger Stone and you're on the Alex Jones show. Joining me now is one of the most impressive young hard charging conservatives in the US Congress, Matt Gates of the first district of Florida.
[3:33:53.000 --> 3:34:10.000]  Matt Gates first came to my attention when he was a member of the Florida House. He is a take no prisoners conservative in the Reagan mold, someone whom great things are expected of.
[3:34:10.000 --> 3:34:35.000]  And he has emerged as a substantial critic of Attorney General Jeff Sessions, specifically in regard to the foibles of the Clinton Foundation and why there doesn't seem to be any current federal investigation of the violations of both law and IRS regulation going on there.
[3:34:35.000 --> 3:34:40.000]  Joining me now Congressman Matt Gates. Matt, welcome to Infowars.
[3:34:40.000 --> 3:34:57.000]  It's good to be on with you, Roger. You know, it is so frustrating that after a rule of law election that we had to send Donald Trump to 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, we still have not seen a thorough robust investigation of the Clinton Foundation.
[3:34:57.000 --> 3:35:08.000]  And here's why that's important. We may have people around the world who purport to be acting on behalf of the United States government where there really wasn't an arms length transaction.
[3:35:08.000 --> 3:35:15.000]  They just got a designation or a contract or some special treatment because they made some donation to the Clinton Foundation.
[3:35:15.000 --> 3:35:23.000]  And so let me set the stage for you and for our viewers regarding how this issue came to be in the House Judiciary Committee.
[3:35:23.000 --> 3:35:35.000]  Each and every week in the House Judiciary Committee, we've got Democrats lobbing these crazy resolutions about Roger Stone, Paul Manafort, Donald Trump, Jared Kushner.
[3:35:35.000 --> 3:35:42.000]  And frankly, I was sick and tired of hearing about it while the American people are expecting us to be delivering on our promises.
[3:35:42.000 --> 3:35:56.000]  And so I filed an amendment to strip every word of the Democrat resolution and to put into that legislation a demand from the House Judiciary Committee that we get to the bottom of what's going on with the Clinton Foundation.
[3:35:56.000 --> 3:36:05.000]  And, you know, is there a situation with Fusion GPS or that made this false dossier on President Trump that we need to know about?
[3:36:05.000 --> 3:36:12.000]  The Uranium One deal that you've covered to a great extent on Infowars remains really something that hasn't been investigated.
[3:36:12.000 --> 3:36:30.000]  And so I've been joined by some of my colleagues in the Congress calling for a special counsel to be appointed by Jeff Sessions or his designee to take this matter up and really get to the bottom of whether or not the United States government was sold out by Hillary Clinton.
[3:36:30.000 --> 3:36:38.000]  Matt, what kind of a response have you gotten both from your colleagues in the House and, of course, from the Justice Department?
[3:36:38.000 --> 3:36:50.000]  Well, in the House, I've had a couple dozen people join me in sponsoring a resolution calling for this special counsel, but with 218 Republicans, we certainly are with more than that.
[3:36:50.000 --> 3:36:59.000]  I'm sorry, with more than 240 Republicans, it's a shame that we don't have more than about 10% of the conference signing on to do this real investigation.
[3:36:59.000 --> 3:37:04.000]  As for Attorney General Sessions, I really wish that there was a stronger response.
[3:37:04.000 --> 3:37:15.000]  He has deferred all issues regarding Russia to Mr. Rosenstein, and I just don't get the sense that Rosenstein is really interested in taking up an investigation of Hillary Clinton.
[3:37:15.000 --> 3:37:28.000]  He seems to be more interested in looking into Donald Trump, and it would be really disappointing, Roger, if just by losing an election, Hillary Clinton got some sort of de facto immunity deal.
[3:37:28.000 --> 3:37:32.000]  That doesn't seem fair to me, and I don't think it seems fair to the American people.
[3:37:32.000 --> 3:37:35.000]  It does seem like she has gotten a pass.
[3:37:35.000 --> 3:37:45.000]  Now, obviously, when you talk about the Clinton Foundation or the Clinton scandals, sure, there's a big piece of this that has to do with Russia.
[3:37:45.000 --> 3:38:02.000]  We now know that John Podesta and his brother were making millions of dollars from the clique around Putin, that Bill and Hillary were paid hundreds of thousands of dollars in speaking fees to give 15-minute speeches in Moscow, in Bill's case.
[3:38:02.000 --> 3:38:19.000]  That's a thinly described, disguised bribe in my opinion, but there is so much more there, particularly the abuse in the wake of the Haitian earthquake, where literally millions of dollars have disappeared.
[3:38:19.000 --> 3:38:29.000]  It boggles the mind that no one at the Trump Justice Department seems to be at all interested in this regard.
[3:38:29.000 --> 3:38:33.000]  Roger, I think they're scared.
[3:38:33.000 --> 3:38:35.000]  The facts are there.
[3:38:35.000 --> 3:38:49.000]  We have evidence that suggests that the Clinton campaign was working in concert with Fusion GPS to proliferate false dossiers about President Trump both before and after his election in order to discredit him.
[3:38:49.000 --> 3:38:55.000]  That is the only evidence that there is with a Russia connection to this election that is out of the ordinary.
[3:38:55.000 --> 3:39:06.000]  I mean, of course, Russia throughout the world engages in efforts to try to manipulate the national discussion and the global discussion of human events and affairs.
[3:39:06.000 --> 3:39:08.000]  That's not anything new.
[3:39:08.000 --> 3:39:13.000]  What's new is that it looks like there was this Russian firm that may have been connected to the Clinton campaign.
[3:39:13.000 --> 3:39:15.000]  Now, you've asked about next steps.
[3:39:15.000 --> 3:39:26.000]  I think it's very disappointing that Attorney General Sessions has taken the position that his recusal on the Russia question means that he won't investigate the Clinton Foundation.
[3:39:26.000 --> 3:39:28.000]  You mentioned Haiti.
[3:39:28.000 --> 3:39:42.000]  There are a number of other circumstances where the Clinton Foundation was essentially a money laundering operation where they would take donations in exchange for special access, special favors, and special treatment with the State Department.
[3:39:42.000 --> 3:39:51.000]  That goes well beyond Russia, so I believe it is entirely within the discretion of Attorney General Sessions to appoint a special counsel.
[3:39:51.000 --> 3:40:03.000]  But he has chosen to take a pass on that and to give all the authority to Rosenstein, who no one elected, and who was not someone that certainly I think the president has tremendous confidence in.
[3:40:03.000 --> 3:40:08.000]  And so I'm looking forward to a circumstance where we get that special counsel appointed.
[3:40:08.000 --> 3:40:09.000]  That really is the next step.
[3:40:09.000 --> 3:40:25.000]  We need a special counsel pursuing Hillary Clinton and the Clinton Foundation because otherwise we send the message to the American people that if someone loses an election, whatever their crimes are, whatever violations of the law they were involved in, they're immediately forgiven upon losing an election.
[3:40:25.000 --> 3:40:30.000]  And that is not the type of sense that the American people have.
[3:40:30.000 --> 3:40:35.000]  We elected Donald Trump because we want to see the rule of law enforced.
[3:40:35.000 --> 3:40:40.000]  You know, I see on the screen now our viewers are able to see this connection to Loretta Lynch.
[3:40:40.000 --> 3:40:43.000]  That's another issue that we think deserves an investigation.
[3:40:43.000 --> 3:40:53.000]  Why did Loretta Lynch tell James Comey to go and lie to the American people and call the Clinton investigation a matter instead of an investigation?
[3:40:53.000 --> 3:40:54.000]  You remember that, Roger?
[3:40:54.000 --> 3:41:00.000]  I mean, that was the Attorney General of the United States telling the FBI director to go and lie to the American people.
[3:41:00.000 --> 3:41:08.000]  The fact that as a Judiciary Committee, as a Congress, we have not investigated that, that really gives me a great sense of discomfort.
[3:41:08.000 --> 3:41:17.000]  The Democrats have always been much better than the Republicans when it came to weaponizing the legal system and the judicial system.
[3:41:17.000 --> 3:41:33.000]  While we're at it, that special prosecutor you refer to can look into these FISA court declarations that indicate that 30,000 Americans were illegally and unconstitutionally surveilled by the Obama NSA.
[3:41:33.000 --> 3:41:50.000]  Yet no one has brought an action against Ms. Rice, Mr. Brennan, Admiral Rogers, and Mr. Clapper, a proven perjurer who lied to the Congress about the fact that he said we had no metadata collection program.
[3:41:50.000 --> 3:41:56.000]  This is extraordinarily important stuff, but the Democrats seem to be getting a pass.
[3:41:56.000 --> 3:42:05.000]  Matt, if you'll stick with us, I'd like to bring you back in the next segment because there's a couple other issues in the Congress I want to pick your brain about.
[3:42:05.000 --> 3:42:07.000]  You're at Infowars.
[3:42:07.000 --> 3:42:11.000]  I'm Roger Stone sitting in for Alex Jones.
[3:42:11.000 --> 3:42:25.000]  And if you like our programming, if you like the way that we are carrying the flag for freedom, well, then I ask you to go to the Infowars.com site now and look at our terrific product line.
[3:42:25.000 --> 3:42:28.000]  40% off survival shield.
[3:42:28.000 --> 3:42:30.000]  That's an extraordinary price.
[3:42:30.000 --> 3:42:33.000]  50% off my favorite brain force.
[3:42:33.000 --> 3:42:39.000]  You see, we don't have a George Soros sitting in the wings writing us big checks.
[3:42:39.000 --> 3:42:42.000]  We can only depend on you.
[3:42:42.000 --> 3:42:44.000]  I will be right back.
[3:42:44.000 --> 3:42:51.000]  James Madison, the father of the Bill of Rights, wrote,
[3:43:15.000 --> 3:43:18.000]  That is the ultimate concern.
[3:43:18.000 --> 3:43:24.000]  The concentration of power, the excess of power, was always the chief concern of the founders of this country.
[3:43:24.000 --> 3:43:27.000]  It was why the anti-fetalists opposed the Constitution.
[3:43:27.000 --> 3:43:35.000]  They believed they put safeguards in the Constitution to abuse that concentration of power, but as James Madison also pointed out, knowledge will forever govern ignorance.
[3:43:35.000 --> 3:43:41.000]  People who mean to be their own governors must arm themselves with the power that knowledge gives.
[3:43:41.000 --> 3:43:46.000]  Arm yourself with the information of what your rulers are doing, of what the real constraints upon them are.
[3:43:46.000 --> 3:43:50.000]  Only then will you have the courage to nullify their actions.
[3:43:50.000 --> 3:44:12.000]  For Infowars.com, I'm David Knight.
[3:44:20.000 --> 3:44:22.000]  We need to be able to keep up the pace.

[3:47:06.000 --> 3:47:18.000]  This is Bernie Sanders and there's a lot of corruption in this country.
[3:47:18.000 --> 3:47:24.000]  And if you want to hear about corruption then you'll listen to Roger Stone on Infowars because he tells the truth.
[3:47:24.000 --> 3:47:38.000]  Some vintage Rolling Stones there, a tune written by Chuck Berry and of course my good friend Senator Bernie Sanders.
[3:47:38.000 --> 3:47:46.000]  Congressman Matt Gaetz was called to the House floor for a vote so we're going to give him a pass but he's promised to come back
[3:47:46.000 --> 3:47:55.000]  and talk to us about the amendment that he's working on that would have the effect of prohibiting the federal government
[3:47:55.000 --> 3:48:06.000]  from using DOJ funds for a crackdown on marijuana in the 29 states that have legalized it under state law.
[3:48:06.000 --> 3:48:17.000]  Matt Gaetz has been a real crusader on this issue and he'll be back on Infowars soon to give us an update on that important issue.
[3:48:17.000 --> 3:48:28.000]  Also in the news for those of you who may not have seen it was an extraordinary 60 minutes interview with a gentleman named Brad Pascal.
[3:48:28.000 --> 3:48:37.000]  Mr. Pascal was the digital advertising director for the Donald Trump for president campaign.
[3:48:37.000 --> 3:48:44.000]  And I think Mr. Pascal's interview comes at a very timely occasion.
[3:48:44.000 --> 3:48:58.000]  It is now that we're just starting to get a focus on the digital advertising campaign that was conducted by allegedly by the Russians
[3:48:58.000 --> 3:49:07.000]  and whether it was effective, how much they spent and whether it really moved any votes.
[3:49:07.000 --> 3:49:18.000]  Given the fact that the amounts of money spent appear to be in the hundreds of thousands and that the number of people who voted in this election
[3:49:18.000 --> 3:49:32.000]  were in the millions, it's doubtful in my opinion that the Russians did much in terms of actually moving votes for or against Donald Trump.
[3:49:32.000 --> 3:49:43.000]  Also, if you have seen the actual copy, the text of their ads, well, they looked like they were written by someone who has Russian as a first language.
[3:49:43.000 --> 3:49:50.000]  I was having a hard time trying to figure out exactly what it was they were trying to say.
[3:49:50.000 --> 3:50:04.000]  Mr. Pascal, starting with a Forbes magazine profile, which was really a profile on the president's son-in-law immediately after the election, has claimed an inordinate amount of credit
[3:50:04.000 --> 3:50:13.000]  for the election of Donald Trump through his alleged digital campaign efforts.
[3:50:13.000 --> 3:50:22.000]  There is, I think, an inadvertent downside to Mr. Pascal's appearance on 60 Minutes.
[3:50:22.000 --> 3:50:29.000]  You see, he was paid $94 million by the Trump campaign.
[3:50:29.000 --> 3:50:37.000]  It is my understanding from sources that I learned about this morning that members of the House and Senate Intelligence Committee
[3:50:37.000 --> 3:50:45.000]  are going to be asking Mr. Pascal to document where the $94 million went.
[3:50:45.000 --> 3:50:58.000]  I can tell you firsthand that the New York Times tried to determine this some many months ago and were unable to do so from public records and logs.
[3:50:58.000 --> 3:51:06.000]  Perhaps Mr. Pascal can show us what he did with $94 million.
[3:51:06.000 --> 3:51:11.000]  We'll keep you updated on this story as it develops.
[3:51:11.000 --> 3:51:23.000]  Steve Bannon now also in the wake of the extraordinary victory in Alabama by Judge Roy Moore,
[3:51:23.000 --> 3:51:32.000]  which many read as a rejection of Senator Mitch McConnell and the Republican leadership in the Senate.
[3:51:32.000 --> 3:51:41.000]  Mr. Bannon has now gone on a jihad against the rhino wing of the Republican Party.
[3:51:41.000 --> 3:51:49.000]  Let me be clear, it's a jihad that I enthusiastically 100% support.
[3:51:49.000 --> 3:51:58.000]  I always thought that Steve Bannon, who really is a good guy, would be more effective as a rabble rouser and an outsider
[3:51:58.000 --> 3:52:05.000]  than he was trying to fit into the button-down culture of the White House.
[3:52:05.000 --> 3:52:17.000]  And indeed, Bannon has made great waves since leaving the White House, toppling Senator McConnell's choice in Alabama,
[3:52:17.000 --> 3:52:26.000]  and now targeting a group of rhino Republicans who have been backstabbing the president.
[3:52:26.000 --> 3:52:38.000]  Now, I know the mainstream media narrative tells you that Robert Corker of Tennessee left the Senate in some fit of conscious
[3:52:38.000 --> 3:52:46.000]  that he has been attacking the president, thus being deified by the mainstream media.
[3:52:46.000 --> 3:52:51.000]  But if you're following us here at Infowars, you know that the truth is far different.
[3:52:51.000 --> 3:52:57.000]  You see, Senator Corker got out of dodge just ahead of the posse.
[3:52:57.000 --> 3:53:09.000]  The FBI and the SEC have been examining a series of trades and other business dealings to determine whether Senator Corker
[3:53:09.000 --> 3:53:17.000]  was taking information that he learned on a proprietary basis as a member of the U.S. Senate
[3:53:17.000 --> 3:53:25.000]  and using that to invest or make trades in hedge funds or other public companies.
[3:53:25.000 --> 3:53:29.000]  This, of course, would be highly illegal.
[3:53:29.000 --> 3:53:42.000]  Among the focus of the investigation is a particular company where Senator Mark Warner and Senator Bob Corker
[3:53:42.000 --> 3:53:54.000]  put together the money to short housing stocks garnering tens of millions of dollars of profit.
[3:53:54.000 --> 3:54:00.000]  I assure you federal investigators will continue to be looking at that.
[3:54:00.000 --> 3:54:12.000]  In any event, Mr. Bannon has his work cut out for him. Not all of these Republican primaries will be as straightforward as Alabama.
[3:54:12.000 --> 3:54:23.000]  Now, recognize that Alabama has a two-tiered process, that there were four candidates in the first election.
[3:54:23.000 --> 3:54:36.000]  The two top vote-getters then ran off in the Republican Party. Watch for the Democrats to make a major play to win in Alabama.
[3:54:36.000 --> 3:54:45.000]  The argument will be that Judge Roy Moore is too far to the right, too far out of the Republican mainstream.
[3:54:45.000 --> 3:54:57.000]  Unfortunately, the Democratic candidate Jim Douglas, by going to his website, seems to have embraced abortion as his signature issue.
[3:54:57.000 --> 3:55:07.000]  I'll be very clear, Mr. Jones is going to find that that dog in Alabama will not, in my opinion, hunt.
[3:55:07.000 --> 3:55:16.000]  In order to pull off an upset victory, well, Doug Jones would have to run as if he were Senator Manchin from West Virginia.
[3:55:16.000 --> 3:55:25.000]  He would have to run to the right of the base of his entire party. And so far, he is not doing that.
[3:55:25.000 --> 3:55:38.000]  If you want my prediction, I think Roy Moore is headed for the U.S. Senate, and I think Steve Bannon is headed for more upset victories around the country.
[3:55:38.000 --> 3:55:48.000]  As far, for example, as Senator Jeff Flake of Arizona, well, I think you can kiss Senator Flake goodbye.
[3:55:48.000 --> 3:56:02.000]  It's really a shame that President Trump was talked into endorsing John McCain in 2016 when McCain was pressed in a Republican primary.
[3:56:02.000 --> 3:56:11.000]  He too could have been beaten. And what has the president gotten for his warm endorsement of the good senator from Arizona?
[3:56:11.000 --> 3:56:25.000]  Treachery, backstabbing, skull-duggery, and an alignment with the most liberal of Democrats on the most important issues of the day,
[3:56:25.000 --> 3:56:28.000]  principally, of course, the health care issue.
[3:56:28.000 --> 3:56:44.000]  John McCain needs to come before the Senate and answer questions about why he was meeting with Oleg Deripaska, a Russian oligarch who's known as a money man for, yes, Vladimir Putin.
[3:56:44.000 --> 3:56:59.000]  In fact, John McCain met with Mr. Deripaska, despite warnings from our intelligence services, that Deripaska was most likely a Kremlin agent and such a meeting could be questionable.
[3:56:59.000 --> 3:57:03.000]  So the mainstream media was absolutely right.
[3:57:03.000 --> 3:57:16.000]  There was a Republican candidate in bed with Putin. There was a Republican candidate for president playing footsies with the Russians. But that candidate was John McCain.
[3:57:16.000 --> 3:57:41.000]  OK, I'm Roger Stone and I'll be right back.
