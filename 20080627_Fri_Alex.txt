[00:00:00.009 --> 00:00:01.110]  We're good.
[00:00:32.054 --> 00:00:35.655]  The dollar continues its slide.
[00:00:35.655 --> 00:00:40.397]  Gold and, of course, other commodities like oil are exploding.
[00:00:40.397 --> 00:00:41.737]  Welcome, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:00:41.737 --> 00:00:48.379]  It is Friday, the 27th day of June 2008.
[00:00:48.379 --> 00:01:01.663]  We had Jordan Maxwell on for about two hours and 50 minutes Monday, and listeners really, really enjoyed hearing from him, thought it was very informative and thought-provoking.
[00:01:02.344 --> 00:01:14.534]  So instead of waiting a year or two until the next time we have him back on, as we normally do, we have Jordan on about once a year on average, I thought why not just go ahead and have Jordan back on today for two hours.
[00:01:14.534 --> 00:01:17.096]  The next hour and the hour after that will be on with us.
[00:01:17.096 --> 00:01:17.836]  Then State Rep.
[00:01:17.836 --> 00:01:27.624]  Charles Keeb, who's helped expose the fact that Oklahoma City was an inside job, he got passed in the state legislature a clause
[00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:32.421]  Restating the sovereignty of Oklahoma against the federal government in the New World Order.
[00:01:32.421 --> 00:01:36.883]  It passed 90 plus, what was it, 93 to 6?
[00:01:36.883 --> 00:01:39.144]  I've got the actual vote here.
[00:01:39.144 --> 00:01:40.865]  Yeah, 93 to 6.
[00:01:40.865 --> 00:01:47.108]  So he'll be joining us coming up in the final hour today.
[00:01:47.108 --> 00:01:52.851]  We'll have open phones with Jordan Maxwell in the second hour with him.
[00:01:52.851 --> 00:01:56.493]  First hour we won't, but in the second hour with Jordan Maxwell,
[00:01:57.079 --> 00:02:02.900]  We will have open phones.
[00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:09.422]  There's a lot of news here in front of me, a lot of information that we're going to be going over.
[00:02:09.422 --> 00:02:11.442]  All of it is extremely important.
[00:02:11.442 --> 00:02:18.023]  Every day, the amount of criminal activity by the globalists just increases.
[00:02:18.023 --> 00:02:24.965]  And the amount of their exposure, the extent to which they are revealed, intensifies.
[00:02:26.894 --> 00:02:28.535]  Credit crunch forcing U.S.
[00:02:28.535 --> 00:02:31.797]  middle classes to live in their cars.
[00:02:31.797 --> 00:02:37.602]  Wall Street plunges towards worst month since the Great Depression.
[00:02:37.602 --> 00:02:47.128]  OPEC chief sees oil at $150 to $170 a barrel in the coming months.
[00:02:47.128 --> 00:02:52.272]  I'm going to cover this when we get back, but I was tuned in to two different radio shows this morning.
[00:02:54.435 --> 00:02:58.056]  One driving over to the office and another one that was on in the office.
[00:02:58.056 --> 00:03:00.436]  Mainstream radio.
[00:03:00.436 --> 00:03:05.557]  And I heard three separate callers.
[00:03:05.557 --> 00:03:21.401]  Two callers driving in, and then a caller in the office just about ten minutes before I went on air, on another show, saying that they are very upset with how
[00:03:23.254 --> 00:03:33.541]  Well, in the last case, the local station, at least for the time, I guess, I'm on at 590 AM, has taken Neil Bortz off and has put a local show on, which is fine and dandy.
[00:03:33.541 --> 00:03:35.483]  I'm not getting in the middle of that.
[00:03:35.483 --> 00:03:43.328]  The point is, the woman was saying, oh, I think it's so great that you're not talking about serious subjects.
[00:03:43.328 --> 00:03:45.870]  I'm tired of hearing all the bad news.
[00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:49.172]  Oh, I'm so glad you've taken him off the air.
[00:03:49.172 --> 00:03:51.754]  I think they're just testing a local bunch in there.
[00:03:52.293 --> 00:04:07.296]  And they're literally talking about stuff like, how old should a girl be when she wears makeup, what is your favorite color, uh, how many tickets they got when they were teenagers, just total puffhead.
[00:04:07.296 --> 00:04:14.058]  And I was thinking, you know, maybe they don't know what they're doing over there putting stuff like that on, but maybe they do.
[00:04:14.058 --> 00:04:15.998]  Because that's what I guess the people want.
[00:04:18.257 --> 00:04:22.358]  Because I was listening to another syndicated show and heard two callers say the same thing.
[00:04:22.358 --> 00:04:25.198]  Hey, I wish you wouldn't be so negative.
[00:04:25.198 --> 00:04:31.300]  I wish you wouldn't, uh, talk about so much negative stuff.
[00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:34.820]  You should just choose to say everything's positive.
[00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:39.201]  So I want to speak to this mindset when we get back.
[00:04:39.201 --> 00:04:43.082]  It is the mindset that's gotten us where we are.
[00:04:43.082 --> 00:04:46.543]  I'm negative about a lot of bad things that are happening because I want them to stop.
[00:04:47.412 --> 00:04:53.679]  Okay, we'll be right back.
[00:04:53.679 --> 00:04:55.641]  Our beloved Republic is on her knees.
[00:04:55.641 --> 00:04:59.264]  The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide.
[00:04:59.264 --> 00:05:01.727]  But in Liberty's darkest hour, there is hope.
[00:05:01.727 --> 00:05:04.750]  The first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:10.096]  It is essential that patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding of the New World Order Master Plan.
[00:05:10.476 --> 00:05:14.379]  We have a short time frame to fully awaken and energize the people to meet this threat.
[00:05:40.316 --> 00:05:40.977]  Watch more.
[00:05:40.977 --> 00:05:42.839]  The Info War is waiting for you.

[00:05:56.706 --> 00:06:00.590]  Fight back by doing what thousands of listeners to the Alex Jones Show have done.
[00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:03.653]  Developed by a major oil company, a product that really works.
[00:06:03.653 --> 00:06:07.418]  Introducing SFR's Protect-to-Complete fuel system and engine treatment.
[00:06:07.418 --> 00:06:10.181]  Just one bottle increases mileage for up to six months.
[00:06:10.181 --> 00:06:13.705]  Fleet tested by major oil companies showing improvements in every car tested.
[00:06:13.945 --> 00:06:17.630]  Stop paying mechanics your hard-earned money to have your injection system cleaned.
[00:06:17.630 --> 00:06:23.518]  ProtectiClean's up to 95% of new injector condition in just one tankful and is safe for all cars.
[00:06:23.518 --> 00:06:30.688]  Tests conducted by General Motors conclude fuel injectors can partially plug in as little as 5,000 miles due to poor gasoline quality.

[00:06:56.612 --> 00:07:02.137]  How about chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodium, formaldehydes, and more?
[00:07:02.137 --> 00:07:07.861]  Even fragrance can indicate the presence of some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[00:07:07.861 --> 00:07:09.343]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[00:07:09.343 --> 00:07:18.350]  I was shocked when I discovered I could be inhaling these additives that can lead to coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath, headaches, nausea, irritation of the skin, and mucous membranes.

[00:08:04.464 --> 00:08:06.006]  Well, so does he.
[00:08:06.006 --> 00:08:10.210]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:10.210 --> 00:08:16.936]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:08:16.936 --> 00:08:21.301]  So, I'm listening to a couple of our talk radio stations this morning.
[00:08:22.671 --> 00:08:29.216]  And the callers are calling in, even though it's not on topic, and saying, we don't want to hear about bad things.
[00:08:29.216 --> 00:08:31.217]  We don't want to hear about oil prices going up.
[00:08:31.217 --> 00:08:35.000]  We don't want to hear about a potential war with Iran.
[00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.682]  We don't want to hear negative things.
[00:08:37.682 --> 00:08:52.072]  And last night, I was scanning around on YouTube, as I always do, and saw a video posted by a young man who said, I listened to Alex for a couple of years, and then I just got really depressed, and I realized he's just a fear monger.
[00:08:52.921 --> 00:09:00.147]  And I choose not to believe his worldview and what he's saying.
[00:09:00.147 --> 00:09:02.649]  And that was basically the nature of it.
[00:09:02.649 --> 00:09:05.951]  He also criticized me because we have sponsors.
[00:09:05.951 --> 00:09:08.754]  Our stations that we're on have to have sponsors, too.
[00:09:08.754 --> 00:09:11.316]  And the network has to have sponsors, and I do, too.
[00:09:11.316 --> 00:09:13.598]  This doesn't happen for free, folks.
[00:09:13.598 --> 00:09:17.020]  But again, that's the child-likeness of the American people.
[00:09:17.020 --> 00:09:19.262]  No connection to reality.
[00:09:19.262 --> 00:09:20.263]  And they believe
[00:09:21.408 --> 00:09:29.432]  That if they say something isn't true or ignore it, that it will make it be so.
[00:09:29.432 --> 00:09:30.913]  Now let's be clear here.
[00:09:30.913 --> 00:09:32.774]  I am fighting the New World Order.
[00:09:32.774 --> 00:09:36.616]  I am criticizing and trying to expose corruption.
[00:09:36.616 --> 00:09:43.680]  Because I want to save what's left and try to rehabilitate what's been taken over of our free society.
[00:09:45.885 --> 00:09:59.993]  We have all these thousands of government documents and think tanks and their own announcements about how they want to have a total control grid and putting in scanners that show your naked body at the airports and children being trained to tattle on their parents and you can't hug or kiss your children or you'll be arrested.
[00:09:59.993 --> 00:10:02.494]  That's now going to be pedophilia in England and the U.S.
[00:10:02.494 --> 00:10:05.596]  so the state can take control of your lives.
[00:10:05.596 --> 00:10:12.980]  And the government is involved in all of these pedophile crimes and all these different Homeland Security deputy heads have gone to jail for it because local police bust them.
[00:10:15.817 --> 00:10:21.383]  And that Dyncor and Halliburton do run child kidnapping rings, and that's mainstream news, and they don't get in trouble.
[00:10:21.383 --> 00:10:23.405]  I mean, I'm not supposed to expose that?
[00:10:23.405 --> 00:10:30.673]  I'm not supposed to talk about how our dollar's plunging in value?
[00:10:30.673 --> 00:10:32.876]  More than a cent a month?
[00:10:32.876 --> 00:10:35.619]  There's not many cents left that it can lose.
[00:10:35.619 --> 00:10:36.580]  You know what that means?
[00:10:40.854 --> 00:10:48.617]  There's the old cliche, the canard of the denial is not a river in North Africa.
[00:10:48.617 --> 00:10:52.119]  This is denial.
[00:10:52.119 --> 00:11:03.103]  If we do not admit how bad things are, if we do not admit how serious things are, if we do not admit how dire our straits are,
[00:11:04.199 --> 00:11:07.601]  Then the evil is going to win, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:11:07.601 --> 00:11:09.522]  We cannot live in denial.
[00:11:09.522 --> 00:11:23.190]  There's this idea that you can just be optimistic about things, and that's certainly true in business and life and, you know, when you're in college trying to get a date, to be optimistic, to be positive, to not just act like you're confident, but to really be confident.
[00:11:23.190 --> 00:11:28.593]  And it's certainly good if you're selling people cars, or it's good if, you know, things like that, or at a cocktail party.
[00:11:28.593 --> 00:11:30.374]  But it only goes so far.
[00:11:30.374 --> 00:11:33.296]  And just, oh Alex, be positive, things aren't that bad.
[00:11:33.976 --> 00:11:47.884]  Hey, I wish that I sometimes didn't know ten years ago that DynCorp, Halliburton, the United Nations were running giant child kidnapping rings.
[00:11:47.884 --> 00:11:55.168]  And I would even try to deny it when I'd see it in foreign newspapers and foreign investigations and lawsuits and people going to jail for it overseas.
[00:11:55.168 --> 00:11:57.369]  And then it came out in major papers in the U.S.
[00:11:57.369 --> 00:12:01.532]  the last four years and was admitted and it was worse than I thought
[00:12:03.837 --> 00:12:09.779]  And even brave two governors went public about it.
[00:12:09.779 --> 00:12:13.220]  And nothing happened.
[00:12:13.220 --> 00:12:18.922]  I mean, you better believe, every day, I wish that wasn't true, because that's scary, folks.
[00:12:18.922 --> 00:12:22.743]  To know the people running our government are as evil as it gets.
[00:12:23.939 --> 00:12:24.899]  Here's another example.
[00:12:24.899 --> 00:12:41.245]  State police guy called in from the Midwest yesterday and he said, you know Alex, I didn't believe you about a lot of this stuff, but now they're getting us ready for federalization, training us so we've got to do what the President says in emergencies, and putting us through these drills, and... But see, I didn't have to believe that he was state police.
[00:12:41.245 --> 00:12:43.686]  I didn't have to believe him even though he sounded credible.
[00:12:43.686 --> 00:12:46.747]  I already know it's in the John Warner Defense Authorization Act.
[00:12:46.747 --> 00:12:48.607]  I already know it's in the Military Commissions Act.
[00:12:48.607 --> 00:12:50.228]  I already know it's in PDD 51.
[00:12:52.020 --> 00:12:53.922]  I've had the Congressman on to talk about it.
[00:12:53.922 --> 00:12:56.344]  I've played clips of them debating it on the House floor.
[00:12:56.344 --> 00:12:58.306]  Congress isn't allowed to see it.
[00:12:58.306 --> 00:12:59.467]  You're going, well, wait a minute.
[00:12:59.467 --> 00:13:00.828]  You said you know what's in it.
[00:13:00.828 --> 00:13:14.922]  Just the two-page cover sheet says the President is a dictator for any emergency, any emergency, including economic or anything they say is an emergency, that the governors are vassals, the state guards, the national guards, the police,
[00:13:15.931 --> 00:13:22.334]  The Congress has no authority, and Congress said, we'd like to see that full report, that full plan, and the White House said, you're not allowed to.
[00:13:22.334 --> 00:13:27.716]  The highest cleared, as high as the President, Homeland Security Committee can't see it.
[00:13:27.716 --> 00:13:33.458]  And then they went on the floor and freaked out over it.
[00:13:33.458 --> 00:13:45.383]  Now, it just so happens they've been expanding this to the executive for decades, and I've interviewed Thomas Sanchez, head of emergency management in Kingsville, the chief of police in San Antonio, Allie Phillips at the time, and a bunch of other people, and we learned in briefings what they were given.
[00:13:46.121 --> 00:13:47.221]  It's gun confiscation.
[00:13:47.221 --> 00:13:48.041]  It's mass arrests.
[00:13:48.041 --> 00:13:49.542]  It's forced inoculations.
[00:13:49.542 --> 00:13:51.322]  Now, I told you that 10 years ago.
[00:13:51.322 --> 00:13:52.302]  11 years ago.
[00:13:52.302 --> 00:13:54.423]  Now, it's in the news.
[00:13:54.423 --> 00:13:58.944]  Now, I can play you newscast where they're saying, yes, we built camps for you.
[00:13:58.944 --> 00:14:01.864]  Yes, we've trained preachers to tell you to go to camps.
[00:14:01.864 --> 00:14:04.145]  Yes, we're going to forcibly inoculate you.
[00:14:04.145 --> 00:14:05.485]  Yes, we're federalizing.
[00:14:05.485 --> 00:14:07.945]  Yes, the President's a dictator.
[00:14:07.945 --> 00:14:11.646]  Yes, and that means Obama or whoever else comes after him.
[00:14:12.739 --> 00:14:14.160]  Even if you love George Bush.
[00:14:14.160 --> 00:14:23.484]  Don't you understand we had conventions and rules and laws and still do against that for a reason?
[00:14:23.484 --> 00:14:30.346]  That powerful, intelligent people throughout history, powerful elites, have always tried to get control of governments.
[00:14:30.346 --> 00:14:30.987]  Why?
[00:14:30.987 --> 00:14:33.048]  Because then you've got the money machines.
[00:14:33.048 --> 00:14:34.288]  You've got the military.
[00:14:34.288 --> 00:14:35.168]  You've got the power.
[00:14:35.168 --> 00:14:36.589]  These are people on power trips.
[00:14:36.589 --> 00:14:37.329]  They want power.
[00:14:37.329 --> 00:14:39.530]  You know, everybody wants to rule the world.
[00:14:39.530 --> 00:14:40.491]  That's just common sense.
[00:14:40.491 --> 00:14:41.231]  Everybody knows that.
[00:14:42.327 --> 00:14:48.172]  Or at least they should, but according to some people, they taught us the last 80 years in this nation, nobody wants to rule the world.
[00:14:48.172 --> 00:14:52.577]  There's no elites, there's no powerful interest.
[00:14:52.577 --> 00:15:07.630]  And I watch this poor young man, who thinks I'm the bad guy, on YouTube, because I get up here and yell and scream about what's happening.
[00:15:07.630 --> 00:15:07.891]  Folks,
[00:15:09.161 --> 00:15:14.885]  I'm thinking about doing a middle-of-the-night live stream on PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:15:14.885 --> 00:15:18.947]  People don't believe it that I now wake up almost every night for hours and can't sleep worried about this.
[00:15:18.947 --> 00:15:22.029]  I've always been somebody that sleeps like the dead.
[00:15:22.029 --> 00:15:25.832]  I woke up at 144 last night.
[00:15:25.832 --> 00:15:27.573]  Been asleep a few hours.
[00:15:27.573 --> 00:15:29.074]  No coffee, no nothing.
[00:15:29.074 --> 00:15:34.237]  And I laid there in bed in the cool of the night looking at the shadows on the walls through the window.
[00:15:35.063 --> 00:15:36.724]  Just thinking about all of this.
[00:15:36.724 --> 00:15:46.251]  I thought, why don't I just have a computer by my bed and I'll just start firing it up and going live at 3 a.m., 4 a.m., 2 a.m.
[00:15:46.251 --> 00:15:49.873]  Just laying there.
[00:15:49.873 --> 00:15:55.497]  I mean, I'm sorry if I can't sleep over this.
[00:15:55.497 --> 00:16:03.102]  When you find out that there is a giant industrial, I mean that means huge, mechanized,
[00:16:07.915 --> 00:16:23.051]  When you realize that the government does control the importation of narcotics, when you realize that they do launder the money in their banks, when you realize they are following every form of tyranny, what are you supposed to do?
[00:16:23.051 --> 00:16:25.593]  And I hear the poor public saying, we don't want to hear this!
[00:16:25.593 --> 00:16:28.136]  I mean, even fake neocon stuff, they don't want to hear.
[00:16:28.911 --> 00:16:35.992]  About the borders are being overrun and how the, you know, blame... Then they want to hear the false alarmism about the Democrats.
[00:16:35.992 --> 00:16:36.493]  No difference.
[00:16:36.493 --> 00:16:43.394]  Makes no... It's pointless to debate these characters.
[00:16:43.394 --> 00:16:48.835]  So, I don't know what I can do for people like that who are living in such denial.
[00:16:48.835 --> 00:16:51.856]  I mean, look at these reports I've got.
[00:16:51.856 --> 00:16:53.956]  This isn't Alex Jones five years ago.
[00:16:57.591 --> 00:17:08.178]  Because we could see 5, 6, 7, 8 years ago, the Federal Reserve printing money so fast it was going out of style, giving everybody credit that real assets were being snatched up.
[00:17:08.178 --> 00:17:13.182]  Then we read the IMF and World Bank documents in 2002, where they were planning the whole thing.
[00:17:13.182 --> 00:17:23.569]  It's just amazing.
[00:17:23.569 --> 00:17:26.812]  Absolutely amazing.
[00:17:26.812 --> 00:17:27.152]  And now,
[00:17:29.494 --> 00:17:36.576]  I have the headlines here in front of me.
[00:17:36.576 --> 00:17:44.699]  Wall Street plunges towards worst month since the Great Depression.
[00:17:44.699 --> 00:17:46.239]  Here's another one, AP.
[00:17:46.239 --> 00:17:47.660]  Oil reaches $142 a barrel on view.
[00:17:47.660 --> 00:17:49.100]  Dollar will keep falling.
[00:17:52.119 --> 00:17:53.399]  Did you hear that?
[00:17:53.399 --> 00:18:10.365]  Now, you'll see this in Reuters and AP Newswires, and you might hear it once a month on some talk show on MSNBC or CNBC, but I'm at the grocery store, I'm at church, I'm deep-sea fishing last week with my son, and I'm talking to businessmen and people, and they don't know.
[00:18:10.365 --> 00:18:11.585]  I'm going, the dollar's been devalued.
[00:18:11.585 --> 00:18:12.745]  They're like, no, it hasn't.
[00:18:12.745 --> 00:18:13.686]  I got money in the bank.
[00:18:13.686 --> 00:18:14.766]  I got a piece of land.
[00:18:14.766 --> 00:18:16.506]  I got a business.
[00:18:16.506 --> 00:18:17.507]  My money isn't devalued.
[00:18:17.507 --> 00:18:19.647]  I'm like, yeah, it is.
[00:18:19.647 --> 00:18:20.828]  And they think they can just say, no.
[00:18:21.914 --> 00:18:23.455]  It's not devalued.
[00:18:23.455 --> 00:18:24.656]  And that it changes it.
[00:18:24.656 --> 00:18:26.637]  Oh, you're an alarmist.
[00:18:26.637 --> 00:18:37.825]  And a lot of people in the population think that if you're talking to them, that if you're telling them about bad things that are happening, you're like a show-off.
[00:18:37.825 --> 00:18:41.407]  You're doing this to act smart.
[00:18:41.407 --> 00:18:44.009]  Somehow they inculcated the population with that view.
[00:18:44.614 --> 00:18:54.257]  Man, I'm just trying to get you to wake up, hoping together we can put political pressure on the establishment to stop the absolute sacking and gutting of this country forever.
[00:18:54.257 --> 00:18:57.478]  Here's another fear-mongering issue I try to put out every day.
[00:18:57.478 --> 00:19:11.922]  I mean, sodium fluoride does attack your brain and glands and every organ and does hurt you and there's thousands of government and institutions and university studies and there's no debating it and you can go look them up yourself and I've had neurologists and scientists and everybody else on to cover it and read all the studies and
[00:19:12.833 --> 00:19:13.893]  I mean, it's there.
[00:19:13.893 --> 00:19:21.456]  You can say it isn't true and slurp your fluoride, but I mean... You can say, first they said there wasn't mercury in the shots, then they said it was there and good for you.
[00:19:21.456 --> 00:19:25.037]  Now they admit it's hurt millions of people.
[00:19:25.037 --> 00:19:25.497]  What do they do?
[00:19:25.497 --> 00:19:30.379]  They increase it by five times in the shots?
[00:19:30.379 --> 00:19:35.320]  I mean, not knowing what's going on will get you hurt real bad.
[00:19:35.320 --> 00:19:40.542]  We'll come back and get into... Wall Street plunges towards worse months since Great Depression on early 1930s.
[00:19:42.424 --> 00:19:46.495]  Oil reaches $142, a few dollars will keep falling.
[00:19:46.495 --> 00:19:49.884]  Just, you can say I'm lying, but I mean, I'm just covering what's happening.
[00:19:53.496 --> 00:19:56.659]  Hi neighbor, this is Steve Schenck, Fearless Task Force.
[00:19:56.659 --> 00:20:00.181]  Life is a gamble, but you can stack the deck.
[00:20:00.181 --> 00:20:10.129]  If you knew what I know about all the problems food will protect you from, you'd start immediately to put every effort and dollar you can get into the biggest supply of food possible.
[00:20:10.129 --> 00:20:15.374]  When the dollar and economy crash, when the imported and genetically poisoned food is all that's left,
[00:20:16.014 --> 00:20:24.580]  When the quarantine and bird flu hit, our only protection and only chance to be fearless is having control of our own supply of food and enough of it.
[00:20:24.580 --> 00:20:32.806]  But if you knew what we haven't yet discovered, you wouldn't waste time listening to the rest of this announcement before charging out and getting a serious food supply.
[00:20:32.806 --> 00:20:36.029]  Decide, it's food now or probably never.
[00:20:36.029 --> 00:20:37.290]  But can you afford to be wrong?
[00:20:37.970 --> 00:20:39.151]  Decide now.
[00:20:39.151 --> 00:20:40.733]  Place your bet.
[00:20:40.733 --> 00:20:42.574]  Can you afford to be wrong?
[00:20:42.574 --> 00:20:43.995]  Call 800-409-5633 on the web efoodsdirect.com.
[00:20:43.995 --> 00:20:44.156]  Call 800-409-5633.
[00:20:44.156 --> 00:20:44.636]  It is a big idea.
[00:20:44.636 --> 00:20:46.638]  A new world order in the near future.
[00:20:59.904 --> 00:21:02.967]  Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[00:21:02.967 --> 00:21:05.790]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[00:21:05.790 --> 00:21:08.593]  Could their objective be world domination?
[00:21:08.593 --> 00:21:11.777]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[00:21:11.777 --> 00:21:19.085]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[00:21:22.113 --> 00:21:27.557]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[00:21:27.557 --> 00:21:31.439]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[00:21:31.439 --> 00:21:34.001]  Bill Burgess makes great progress toward a world government.
[00:21:34.001 --> 00:21:35.162]  Most people have no idea.
[00:21:35.162 --> 00:21:35.942]  They're not after money.
[00:21:35.942 --> 00:21:37.223]  They have all the money they need.
[00:21:37.223 --> 00:21:37.984]  They're after power.
[00:21:37.984 --> 00:21:39.365]  That's what they're after these years.

[00:21:50.872 --> 00:21:51.953]  You have been warned.
[00:21:52.694 --> 00:21:56.138]  You ever have one of those days where everything goes right?
[00:21:56.138 --> 00:21:58.460]  First, I get the best parking space at work.
[00:21:58.460 --> 00:22:01.764]  Tonight, I have a date with a very lovely Rachel.
[00:22:01.764 --> 00:22:08.652]  And today, I gave a killer presentation in Sydney, finalized a contract in London, and demoed our new product in Boston.
[00:22:08.652 --> 00:22:10.755]  Online, from my desk, with Webex.
[00:22:11.235 --> 00:22:14.537]  Webex lets me take meetings and give presentations from my desk.
[00:22:14.537 --> 00:22:19.321]  I just talk to clients on the phone and they watch what's happening on my desktop from their desktop.
[00:22:19.321 --> 00:22:23.263]  So I can travel the world and still be here for my date tonight with Rachel.
[00:22:23.263 --> 00:22:24.884]  Travel less, meet online.

[00:24:08.712 --> 00:24:12.654]  But we're not supposed to talk about that!
[00:24:35.501 --> 00:24:39.822]  Well, people stopped getting offended by cops bossing them around.
[00:24:39.822 --> 00:24:53.207]  I mean, we began to just listen to all the lies, accept cameras on every corner, accept open borders, accept corruption.
[00:24:54.784 --> 00:25:15.537]  We stopped looking into things and just said, hey, life's good, everything's fine, and a bunch of powerful interests came in here, and they set up regional boards, they recruited the establishment, the bankers, the media heads, they all share power with each other, they intensify their power, and a couple thousand people, as the Washington Post reports, the super class, are taking this country down.
[00:25:15.537 --> 00:25:17.238]  Is it enough for them to have trillions of dollars?
[00:25:17.238 --> 00:25:19.159]  Is it enough for them to have incredible power?
[00:25:19.159 --> 00:25:21.820]  They want it all.
[00:25:21.820 --> 00:25:24.262]  They want to use us as a war machine to invade other countries.
[00:25:24.938 --> 00:25:32.104]  They are capturing the United States because politically, the people don't want to be a imperial war engine.
[00:25:32.104 --> 00:25:32.965]  Who said that?
[00:25:32.965 --> 00:25:35.467]  Zbigniew Brzezinski in his last two books.
[00:25:35.467 --> 00:25:38.449]  One published 2007, one published 1998.
[00:25:38.449 --> 00:25:40.691]  Grant Chessboard is one of them.
[00:25:40.691 --> 00:25:44.634]  He said we need terror attacks to get them to go along with us.
[00:25:44.634 --> 00:25:50.759]  We need to have huge events, catastrophic, large numbers of dead citizens to unify them around a war for world government.
[00:25:52.816 --> 00:25:53.717]  Who else says that?
[00:25:53.717 --> 00:25:55.618]  The PNAC documents written by Dick Cheney.
[00:25:55.618 --> 00:25:56.358]  Who else says that?
[00:25:56.358 --> 00:26:02.803]  Syndicated columnist and internal White House memos and Republican National Conference memos.
[00:26:02.803 --> 00:26:10.088]  National Committee memos and state memos and now McCain's advisor comes out Monday and says another terror attack would sure help us.
[00:26:10.088 --> 00:26:12.089]  People say, why would the government stage an attack?
[00:26:12.089 --> 00:26:13.990]  Why would this cabal stage an attack?
[00:26:13.990 --> 00:26:16.612]  They're telling you they get power and control out of it.
[00:26:19.051 --> 00:26:26.016]  And I'm telling you, whether it's McCain or Obama that gets into office, you're gonna have an inaugural bombing.
[00:26:26.016 --> 00:26:27.857]  You're gonna have a big event, folks.
[00:26:27.857 --> 00:26:30.018]  It could be a cratered city.
[00:26:30.018 --> 00:26:31.519]  A third of Chicago gone.
[00:26:31.519 --> 00:26:32.740]  Or Dallas.
[00:26:32.740 --> 00:26:33.701]  Or New York.
[00:26:33.701 --> 00:26:34.841]  Or Los Angeles.
[00:26:34.841 --> 00:26:35.702]  Or San Francisco.
[00:26:39.184 --> 00:26:41.465]  They've got to bring you to heel and they will do it.
[00:26:41.465 --> 00:26:42.385]  They're ruthless.
[00:26:42.385 --> 00:26:43.685]  That's why they're in control.
[00:26:43.685 --> 00:26:47.986]  Do you know what it means, yuppies, when you keep laughing and saying the dollar isn't devalued?
[00:26:47.986 --> 00:26:53.507]  That means your savings, your stocks, everything is being devalued that's denominated in dollars.
[00:26:53.507 --> 00:26:57.388]  That means everybody else who you're in business with is being hurt by this.
[00:26:57.388 --> 00:27:04.230]  That means all the cost of basically everything we buy and sell are massively increased because of dollar devaluation.
[00:27:04.230 --> 00:27:07.331]  Do you understand what that means?
[00:27:07.331 --> 00:27:08.091]  And I've been saying
[00:27:08.951 --> 00:27:17.298]  For the last seven years, since they started devaluing the dollar, that it was a red-level crisis, and you laugh, and you still laugh, and say, I am a fairmonger.
[00:27:17.298 --> 00:27:18.279]  Well, you know what?
[00:27:18.279 --> 00:27:25.365]  It's pretty much too late now, and it's not my fault what's happened, and I did the best I could to warn you, and what did I get for it?
[00:27:25.365 --> 00:27:27.327]  I got hated for it!
[00:27:27.327 --> 00:27:28.828]  You want somebody to lie to you?
[00:27:28.828 --> 00:27:30.170]  There's plenty of them to do that.
[00:27:30.170 --> 00:27:30.830]  Go find them.
[00:27:30.830 --> 00:27:32.852]  Go, go, go have them tell you everything's wonderful!
[00:27:35.034 --> 00:27:56.370]  That's like if your pipes have busted and you're walking around your house while you're in two feet of water and it's ruining your furniture and carpet and everything else and grandma's watercolors on the wall are getting ruined and you go, it's negative, there's no water in here, I choose to be positive and I'm not gonna fear monger instead of getting the pipes fixed, getting the water turned off at the street.
[00:27:56.370 --> 00:28:00.713]  You'll let it run out in the street and ruin your house and let the floor cave in and the ceiling cave in.
[00:28:00.713 --> 00:28:02.694]  I mean that literally, that's what you do.
[00:28:02.694 --> 00:28:03.415]  I don't understand it.
[00:28:04.403 --> 00:28:07.644]  And then I'm bad!
[00:28:07.644 --> 00:28:10.666]  I can't properly express how bad it is, okay?
[00:28:10.666 --> 00:28:12.326]  You understand?
[00:28:12.326 --> 00:28:18.049]  The human-chimpanzee crosses they declassified they had five years ago?
[00:28:18.049 --> 00:28:21.510]  Human-bovine, human-spider, human-rat.
[00:28:21.510 --> 00:28:24.071]  This isn't funny!
[00:28:24.071 --> 00:28:32.195]  Not just for humanity and what it means, but the fact of the megaviruses by crossing different zoological creatures with almost sapient-sapient.
[00:28:33.724 --> 00:28:34.325]  Oil reaches $142.
[00:28:34.325 --> 00:28:38.408]  On view, dollar will keep falling.
[00:28:38.408 --> 00:28:42.311]  Oil futures climb briefly to a new record, above $142 a barrel Friday.
[00:28:42.311 --> 00:28:45.313]  On expectations of the weakening dollar, a major factor in crude.
[00:28:45.313 --> 00:28:49.977]  Stratospheric rise will expand its decline and add to oil's appeal.
[00:28:49.977 --> 00:28:57.062]  And then it says here, that's the AP, here's the UK Daily Mail, how dare them, Fairmonger.
[00:28:57.062 --> 00:28:58.944]  They're just now having to admit to you what's happening.
[00:29:00.322 --> 00:29:03.384]  And that means they've decided to give up the ghosts, as Bob Chapman said.
[00:29:03.384 --> 00:29:05.086]  Usually they just lie about all this.
[00:29:05.086 --> 00:29:07.708]  Oh my God, this is bad.
[00:29:07.708 --> 00:29:15.814]  I mean, the fact that this is all over, at least the news wires on our news, you know, they don't tell the drooling slaves this, but people who actually read news wires, they're telling us.
[00:29:15.814 --> 00:29:19.717]  Wall Street plunges towards worse months since the Great Depression on early 1930s.
[00:29:19.717 --> 00:29:21.919]  I'm gonna cover this when we get back.
[00:29:23.695 --> 00:29:25.517]  And I'm totally freaked out.
[00:29:25.517 --> 00:29:27.798]  You understand how leveraged into debt we are?
[00:29:27.798 --> 00:29:29.039]  You realize what's gonna happen?
[00:29:29.039 --> 00:29:30.781]  War in the streets!
[00:29:30.781 --> 00:29:37.486]  This'll make 1933 look like choir practice, my God!
[00:29:37.486 --> 00:29:39.868]  And you think it's funny, yuppies!
[00:29:39.868 --> 00:29:44.031]  It isn't funny!
[00:29:44.031 --> 00:29:45.412]  We're on the march.
[00:29:45.412 --> 00:29:47.954]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:47.954 --> 00:29:50.656]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:29:54.011 --> 00:29:56.853]  Terror Storm, a history of government-sponsored terror.
[00:29:56.853 --> 00:29:58.414]  Loose Change Final Cut.
[00:29:58.414 --> 00:30:00.575]  Endgame, blueprint for global enslavement.
[00:30:00.575 --> 00:30:02.477]  The true story of the Bilderberg Group.
[00:30:02.477 --> 00:30:03.958]  The late great USA.
[00:30:03.958 --> 00:30:05.719]  America, freedom to fascism.
[00:30:05.719 --> 00:30:12.744]  These are just a few of the hundreds of powerful documentary films and books available at truthnews.us and prisonplanet.com.

[00:33:14.222 --> 00:33:17.186]  Sooner or later gotta cut you down.
[00:33:17.186 --> 00:33:19.650]  Sooner or later gotta cut you down.
[00:33:21.832 --> 00:33:24.996]  We're back live, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:33:41.744 --> 00:33:43.145]  It is Friday, 27th day of June, 2008.
[00:33:43.145 --> 00:33:46.387]  Jordan Maxwell joins us next hour, live, on this Friday.
[00:33:46.387 --> 00:33:47.788]  Then, State Rep Charles Key.
[00:33:47.788 --> 00:33:51.391]  No, he's not exposing Oklahoma City as an inside job.
[00:33:51.391 --> 00:33:53.552]  He'll be doing that too for an hour.
[00:34:11.454 --> 00:34:18.476]  He is going to be on the show to talk about how they've passed a law to secede from the New World Order because that's now what the federal government is.
[00:34:18.476 --> 00:34:19.917]  We'll tell you about that coming up.
[00:34:19.917 --> 00:34:21.237]  It is big news.
[00:34:21.237 --> 00:34:26.179]  90 plus percent of the legislature went to pass that.
[00:34:26.179 --> 00:34:34.202]  Finishing up with this important news story, Wall Street plunges towards worse month since the Great Depression on the early 1930s.
[00:34:35.856 --> 00:34:37.157]  This is how 1930 started.
[00:34:37.157 --> 00:34:44.042]  It started with about a year of the markets racing up and down, up and down, up and down.
[00:34:44.042 --> 00:34:47.284]  And with a credit crisis, which the private banks created.
[00:34:47.284 --> 00:34:51.347]  And that's now been admitted and their own documents have been released that they organized it.
[00:34:51.347 --> 00:34:55.550]  They had to bring everything down to nothing to buy up most of the country.
[00:34:55.550 --> 00:34:57.732]  This is another shearing to the bone.
[00:34:57.732 --> 00:35:03.556]  Shares plunged on both sides of the Atlantic yesterday because of fears over oil, inflation, and the global economy.
[00:35:03.556 --> 00:35:04.297]  Inflation.
[00:35:05.402 --> 00:35:06.543]  In every commodity.
[00:35:06.543 --> 00:35:14.729]  Corn, wheat, oil, natural gas, silver, gold, copper, palladium.
[00:35:14.729 --> 00:35:17.091]  In London, the FTSE 100 slumped 2.6%, or 147.9 points to 5518.2.
[00:35:17.091 --> 00:35:21.234]  Meanwhile, in America, the Dow Jones fell more than 350 points to its lowest level since October 1st, 2006.
[00:35:21.234 --> 00:35:24.337]  It is now on course for the worst June performance since the Great Depression in the early 1930s.
[00:35:38.223 --> 00:35:39.524]  And it goes on.
[00:35:39.524 --> 00:35:41.727]  So they're panicking.
[00:35:41.727 --> 00:35:45.410]  I don't know if it's going to implode this year, next year, two years from now.
[00:35:45.410 --> 00:35:49.895]  The point is that the fundamentals have never been this bad.
[00:35:49.895 --> 00:35:55.721]  With the amount of leveraged debt, the amount of derivatives, it's over $600 trillion.
[00:35:55.721 --> 00:35:56.902]  It is insane.
[00:35:58.246 --> 00:36:05.669]  And all the big boys are buying mountain redoubts with private security firms and getting out of the country, getting out of Israel.
[00:36:05.669 --> 00:36:10.751]  I don't... Ask yourselves why, I don't know, getting out of the U.S., getting out of Israel.
[00:36:10.751 --> 00:36:16.433]  They are... God knows what they're gonna do to this country.
[00:36:16.433 --> 00:36:20.155]  And maybe this won't happen, maybe it'll pull out.
[00:36:20.155 --> 00:36:20.735]  But the...
[00:36:21.627 --> 00:36:23.748]  Chances are, it's going to be very, very bad.
[00:36:23.748 --> 00:36:25.108]  How bad it is, is the question.
[00:36:25.108 --> 00:36:29.190]  I mean, it's already bad, and this is only the leading edge of a storm.
[00:36:29.190 --> 00:36:30.690]  It gets much more intense.
[00:36:30.690 --> 00:36:38.653]  I wanted to bring Steve Shank on, because he hasn't been on with us in about a month, and Steve is the oldest continually-operating, affordable foods company in the nation, and he's a great guy.
[00:36:38.653 --> 00:36:41.574]  I've gotten food from him now, what is it, four or five times?
[00:36:41.574 --> 00:36:44.374]  And then I get it and give it to family, I keep some for myself.
[00:36:44.374 --> 00:36:48.916]  And it isn't because I'm living in fear, it's because I'm living in a greater level of control of the general public.
[00:36:49.463 --> 00:36:50.823]  Everything goes to hell in a handbasket.
[00:36:50.823 --> 00:36:52.704]  I've got a couple-year food supply.
[00:36:52.704 --> 00:36:54.445]  And millions went hungry.
[00:36:54.445 --> 00:37:00.767]  It was just a university study last month showing that 8 million people starved to death.
[00:37:00.767 --> 00:37:02.567]  And then they got sick.
[00:37:02.567 --> 00:37:04.508]  And then that was marked on their death certificate.
[00:37:04.508 --> 00:37:08.289]  Because when they got... Most people who die in Africa, it's not starvation.
[00:37:08.289 --> 00:37:10.230]  It's just they get real weak and then something kills them.
[00:37:10.976 --> 00:37:11.617]  Eight million people.
[00:37:11.617 --> 00:37:13.858]  You can pull that up.
[00:37:13.858 --> 00:37:17.321]  But, you know, the point is I'm not saying any of that's going to happen.
[00:37:17.321 --> 00:37:19.322]  It's just that I have a responsibility.
[00:37:19.322 --> 00:37:22.465]  Some paper insurance policy can go up in smoke.
[00:37:22.465 --> 00:37:26.808]  But storable food is something that won't and something I've got.
[00:37:26.808 --> 00:37:28.930]  Steve, thanks for coming on with us.
[00:37:28.930 --> 00:37:32.332]  It's good to be with you, Alex, again.
[00:37:32.332 --> 00:37:36.655]  And it's interesting that you commented on how bad Wall Street is right now.
[00:37:36.655 --> 00:37:38.317]  This is only the end of June.
[00:37:40.450 --> 00:37:49.674]  All of the problems that we were expecting back at the beginning of the year, Alex, we were expecting to hit heavy duty in September.
[00:37:49.674 --> 00:38:00.758]  We are a full three months ahead of schedule in terms of what those of us that were tracking this, and I know that you're right at the leading edge of that.
[00:38:00.758 --> 00:38:05.079]  You've done a masterful job of tracking what's happening in the country.
[00:38:05.079 --> 00:38:07.160]  And the fact is, you mentioned
[00:38:09.896 --> 00:38:16.486]  Uh, what's going on with the gasoline and the fuel issues?
[00:38:16.486 --> 00:38:19.571]  Right now, in the rest of the world, they're screaming nothing.
[00:38:19.571 --> 00:38:21.433]  They're not even talking about gas.
[00:38:21.433 --> 00:38:24.177]  They're talking about food, food, food, food, food.
[00:38:25.767 --> 00:38:35.718]  Right here in our country, what we've got, all of your listeners know that gas prices are just absolutely going nuts, and there is no end in sight.
[00:38:35.718 --> 00:38:40.683]  And the crop was bad because of a lot of rain that flooded the Midwest last year, and now it happened again.
[00:38:40.683 --> 00:38:42.826]  I wanted to ask you, does that intensify things?
[00:38:43.969 --> 00:38:45.191]  Oh, immeasurably.
[00:38:45.191 --> 00:38:59.711]  I flew from Florida to Chicago the day before yesterday, and for an hour and a half at roughly, what, 300 and some odd miles an hour, I was looking down at nothing but a great big ocean that had a few islands in it.
[00:39:00.351 --> 00:39:07.513]  It is absolutely huge, they say over 5 million acres, and the main corn crop areas.
[00:39:07.513 --> 00:39:19.115]  And here's the, you are used to exposing really dumb things, but we've got to give the dumber than a box of rocks award to the EPA and the U.S.
[00:39:19.115 --> 00:39:28.057]  Department of Agriculture, because right now they are debating whether to allow farmers to pay $75 an acre to put land back into production.
[00:39:29.972 --> 00:39:32.293]  And they're doing that on June 22nd.
[00:39:32.293 --> 00:39:39.497]  They started that, which means that even if they do put that land into production, they will not get a crop this year.
[00:39:39.497 --> 00:39:50.402]  And one of the things that we're finding out... Remember, you and I have talked about China, and many of us have wondered what they're going to do with that $1.3 trillion that they have.
[00:39:50.402 --> 00:39:51.823]  Well, now we know.
[00:39:51.823 --> 00:39:54.905]  They are going around the world buying land,
[00:39:55.518 --> 00:40:01.505]  And they are going around the world buying food at four times the ask price right now.
[00:40:01.505 --> 00:40:06.190]  They're buying futures at four times the ask price right now.
[00:40:06.190 --> 00:40:11.136]  They've got the money to do it, and that means that there is going to be no food very soon.
[00:40:11.136 --> 00:40:13.819]  Now, with regard to the gas prices,
[00:40:14.500 --> 00:40:17.644]  What happens when you run out of money and you can't afford the gas?
[00:40:17.644 --> 00:40:20.106]  You can park your car and you can stop traveling.
[00:40:20.106 --> 00:40:22.049]  That is happening, Alex.
[00:40:22.049 --> 00:40:22.909]  That is happening.
[00:40:22.909 --> 00:40:23.770]  Are you kidding?
[00:40:23.770 --> 00:40:30.638]  I mean, I see five times as many mopeds and motorcycles now out on the roads, buzzing around like wasps everywhere.
[00:40:30.638 --> 00:40:32.240]  Little Vespas and things.
[00:40:32.240 --> 00:40:35.423]  And people I know are selling their cars, even small cars, and getting them.
[00:40:36.144 --> 00:40:39.225]  And again, a lot of people who are well off say, oh, I don't care.
[00:40:39.225 --> 00:40:40.986]  Well, that's going to affect your business.
[00:40:40.986 --> 00:40:42.947]  In fact, here is the UK Daily Mail.
[00:40:42.947 --> 00:40:52.651]  The scared mood on the trading floors came amid fears that soaring energy prices will push up inflation and erode consumer spending, dramatically reducing company profits.
[00:40:52.651 --> 00:40:55.992]  You see, this goes across all lines.
[00:40:55.992 --> 00:40:57.273]  Yeah, it does.
[00:40:57.273 --> 00:41:02.715]  But the problem is that what happens if you run out of gas, you don't travel.
[00:41:04.293 --> 00:41:07.178]  If you run out of food, which is the subject that...
[00:41:08.696 --> 00:41:11.777]  Nobody is talking about that that much in the country.
[00:41:11.777 --> 00:41:16.398]  However, all the investors, all of the money, Alex, is going into food.
[00:41:16.398 --> 00:41:18.738]  They're buying up food like crazy.
[00:41:18.738 --> 00:41:19.958]  They're buying up farmland.
[00:41:19.958 --> 00:41:21.839]  They're buying up equipment.
[00:41:21.839 --> 00:41:29.000]  They're doing everything they can because the investors know that the real issue is not gas, not fuel.
[00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:30.921]  The real issue is food.
[00:41:30.921 --> 00:41:37.422]  Because, you see, if you can't afford the food, as many Americans already, with the inflation that we've had already, Alex,
[00:41:38.067 --> 00:41:47.689]  Many Americans, we're getting emails all the time at eFoodsDirect.com that are telling us, hey, we can't afford food now, how are we supposed to put our food ahead?
[00:41:47.689 --> 00:41:51.310]  So we've made some adjustments in what we're telling folks.
[00:41:51.310 --> 00:41:58.071]  It used to be, up until a few weeks ago, that we said, what you need to do is set aside some money, and we did some calculations.
[00:41:58.071 --> 00:42:02.712]  You know that food that you got from eFoodsDirect?
[00:42:02.712 --> 00:42:05.393]  We calculated what's going on.
[00:42:05.393 --> 00:42:06.853]  Do you realize, Alex,
[00:42:07.563 --> 00:42:15.708]  That families can get this year's food at half the cost of last year's groceries right now.
[00:42:15.708 --> 00:42:20.810]  If they buy bulk food, which, by the way, it turns out it's superfood.
[00:42:20.810 --> 00:42:28.154]  We've done some comparisons on the one-year supplies, and particularly this two-month grab-and-go thing, which I really need to tell you about.
[00:42:28.154 --> 00:42:31.596]  But this stuff is actually superfood.
[00:42:31.596 --> 00:42:33.257]  It's got big taste.
[00:42:33.257 --> 00:42:34.698]  It's extremely healthy.
[00:42:35.282 --> 00:42:43.325]  It's extremely easy to fix, and the cost, like I say, is running at half the cost of last year's groceries.
[00:42:43.325 --> 00:42:56.151]  Well, I would just add that because it's freeze-dried or dehydrated, it also fits in very small cans compared to the amount that it would be in store-bought stuff, so it's also very, very portable, and that's important as well.
[00:42:57.330 --> 00:43:13.753]  Well, it really is, and the thing that I needed to mention, and you and I haven't talked that much about it, but we've got hurricane season coming up, and right now, with all the weird weather worldwide, people can't help but notice this.
[00:43:13.753 --> 00:43:22.555]  With all of the weird conditions with transportation, with the threat of possibly quarantines, with all of the stuff we've got coming at us.
[00:43:23.314 --> 00:43:32.563]  What I'd like to have all of your listeners to do is get up on eFoodsDirect.com and take a look at the two-month Grab and Go Kit.
[00:43:32.563 --> 00:43:47.357]  This is 200 meals, and literally what we've got right now, Roger, with the high price of food, we've got a lot of families that are actually eating this right now because they can put in top quality meals, extremely nutritious stuff,
[00:43:48.411 --> 00:43:51.654]  At half the cost of last year's groceries.
[00:43:51.654 --> 00:44:02.122]  So one of these packs that feeds a person two months, three good square meals a day plus an additional 20 meals, is going to cost them about $5.25 a day.
[00:44:02.122 --> 00:44:04.044]  Homeless people can't get by on that.
[00:44:06.916 --> 00:44:13.038]  Well, that's what they get by going to you, you know, the folks that actually get the food and prepare it and put it in the cans.
[00:44:13.038 --> 00:44:15.059]  Give them the phone number if they also want to call.
[00:44:15.059 --> 00:44:18.941]  A lot of my listeners, probably 30%, aren't on the internet.
[00:44:18.941 --> 00:44:21.161]  A lot of others would rather just call.
[00:44:21.161 --> 00:44:24.063]  How do they call eFoods Direct, the J. Michael Stevens Group?
[00:44:24.063 --> 00:44:24.803]  Just go 800-409-5633.
[00:44:24.803 --> 00:44:25.083]  That's 800-409-5633.
[00:44:33.929 --> 00:44:43.178]  And the main thing that every family should have in their trunk, these little two-month grab-and-go things, they come in two cases.
[00:44:43.178 --> 00:44:44.620]  The meals are already there.
[00:44:44.620 --> 00:44:45.501]  They're the quick fix.
[00:44:45.501 --> 00:44:46.722]  Yeah, it's two white boxes.
[00:44:46.722 --> 00:44:48.123]  A lot of folks in the office have gotten that.
[00:44:48.123 --> 00:44:49.665]  We've got a few of those here at the office.
[00:44:50.385 --> 00:44:52.026]  Uh, just to have here.
[00:44:52.026 --> 00:44:54.327]  It's something I really believe in and it's a great deal.
[00:44:54.327 --> 00:44:55.448]  Again, eFoodsDirect.
[00:44:55.448 --> 00:44:58.810]  There's big banners up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:44:58.810 --> 00:45:00.031]  You really can't miss it.
[00:45:00.031 --> 00:45:03.973]  eFoodsDirect.com, eFoodsDirect.com.
[00:45:03.973 --> 00:45:06.514]  Just an E and then foodsdirect.com.
[00:45:06.514 --> 00:45:07.895]  And give them that number again, Steve.
[00:45:07.895 --> 00:45:09.776]  I want people to call the number.
[00:45:09.776 --> 00:45:10.056]  It's 800-409-5633.
[00:45:10.056 --> 00:45:10.236]  That's 800-409-563.
[00:45:17.629 --> 00:45:19.930]  5, 6, 3, 3.
[00:45:19.930 --> 00:45:26.372]  Anybody that is in the way of this potential storm area, we're into the hurricane season.
[00:45:26.372 --> 00:45:46.800]  Anybody, or hey, the people in the middle of this country, Alex, if we'd have talked to them three months ago and said, hey, you probably need some sort of an emergency evacuation kit or something that you can live on for a couple months until a disaster disappears, they'd have thought we were half a bubble off with one on the water.
[00:45:46.940 --> 00:45:47.821]  Well, here's the deal.
[00:45:47.821 --> 00:45:57.027]  The Feds have spent billions, and I mean billions, the last seven years, six and a half years, putting huge billboards up saying, get ready, have a five-day food supply.
[00:45:57.027 --> 00:46:00.249]  They're just doing that so they can claim they warned us.
[00:46:00.249 --> 00:46:03.591]  They know they're messing with the weather, and I've had the father of weather weapons on.
[00:46:03.591 --> 00:46:07.454]  They are messing with it, folks, with antennas and with spraying.
[00:46:07.454 --> 00:46:11.116]  They now admit that they've been doing it, but they say it's for own good.
[00:46:11.116 --> 00:46:13.618]  They're involved in just all sorts of behavior.
[00:46:13.618 --> 00:46:16.780]  But look, Steve, my main reason we're having horrible food
[00:46:17.583 --> 00:46:18.448]  It's the economics.
[00:46:19.150 --> 00:46:30.394]  I mean, I know that there is a food shortage worldwide because of bad weather, but you compounded that, all the speculators racing around, because the dollar is going in the toilet, and so every commodity is exploding.
[00:46:30.394 --> 00:46:40.077]  And so you're right, these foreigners that have better currencies than us, Americans can't compete for the food we grow now, and so a lot of staple items are going to have already exploded in price.
[00:46:40.077 --> 00:46:45.398]  You'll still be able to, I guess, fill your belly up on some of the side things, but that could potentially run low as well.
[00:46:45.398 --> 00:46:47.399]  The whole point is, is that during the Depression,
[00:46:48.211 --> 00:46:51.412]  This is why I believe people should get storable food, regardless of what happens.
[00:46:51.412 --> 00:46:52.633]  And I don't know what's going to happen.
[00:46:52.633 --> 00:46:54.314]  I hope everything's fine.
[00:46:54.314 --> 00:47:04.098]  But bottom line, the economics, if you have 90% or 85% living on the farms, being self-sufficient in the 1930s, it's now 90% in the cities.
[00:47:04.098 --> 00:47:07.099]  Of the 10% on the farms, only half are self-sufficient.
[00:47:07.099 --> 00:47:15.943]  Most of the farms, people just live on them and maybe have a horse or cow or two and they drive in to, you know, work at the coal plant or, you know, work at the prison.
[00:47:15.943 --> 00:47:17.464]  They're not self-sufficient and so,
[00:47:18.562 --> 00:47:20.083]  I don't know.
[00:47:40.297 --> 00:47:43.420]  And, uh, it's just amazing.
[00:47:43.420 --> 00:47:44.962]  Folks, you need to call Steve Schenck.
[00:47:44.962 --> 00:47:47.204]  You need to get storable food.
[00:47:47.204 --> 00:47:56.873]  Uh, Steve, if they just want a catalog, or if they just want to check out the website, efoodsdirect.com, but what about folks that don't have internet and just want to get a basic rundown of what you've got?
[00:47:57.941 --> 00:48:04.504]  Well, what they do is they call 800-409-5633, and we send them out a whole packet.
[00:48:04.504 --> 00:48:10.386]  It's got a couple of CDs of some seminars that I've done, and it also lists what's in there.
[00:48:10.386 --> 00:48:20.350]  This comparison is just phenomenal, where you can literally put in a whole year's supply of food this year at half the cost of your groceries from last year.
[00:48:20.350 --> 00:48:21.971]  You know, that's something that's key to add.
[00:48:21.971 --> 00:48:25.452]  You're saying you've got DVDs and audios and things for people that want them.
[00:48:26.303 --> 00:48:27.484]  Yep, absolutely.
[00:48:27.484 --> 00:48:29.607]  And they come out with the packet that they asked for.
[00:48:29.607 --> 00:48:32.691]  So, ask for the doggone thing, get some information.
[00:48:32.691 --> 00:48:37.897]  Those of you that have website access, get up on efoozdirect.com.
[00:48:37.897 --> 00:48:40.259]  We've posted, Alex, about 200 articles.
[00:48:42.021 --> 00:48:42.802]  We're good to go.
[00:48:59.978 --> 00:49:01.598]  Honest, it really is.
[00:49:01.598 --> 00:49:05.740]  And even if you can't stand me, I know I can get pretty obnoxious.
[00:49:05.740 --> 00:49:07.960]  Alex is kind of common, cool, and collected.
[00:49:07.960 --> 00:49:08.600]  Oh yeah, right.
[00:49:08.600 --> 00:49:14.682]  But even if you can't stand me, for Pete's sake, get food.
[00:49:14.682 --> 00:49:19.043]  Even if you don't get it from eFoods Direct, just look at our warnings so you don't get some grabby food.
[00:49:19.043 --> 00:49:23.124]  Well, bottom line, can people get that packet free?
[00:49:24.717 --> 00:49:25.417]  Oh, absolutely.
[00:49:25.417 --> 00:49:26.237]  We sent it out for you.
[00:49:26.237 --> 00:49:28.498]  Oh, and here's something that they've got to know.
[00:49:28.498 --> 00:49:30.618]  Pay close attention.
[00:49:30.618 --> 00:49:38.600]  As folks have called in, and we tell them that we're shipping out these one-year supplies, it has a one-week shipping time.
[00:49:38.600 --> 00:49:49.522]  There are food companies out there that are talking about three and four months before they can get the back orders, and they will not be able to fill the back orders, so they won't be able to... No, listen, we've been approached by a lot of other food companies, but I'll go to their website.
[00:49:49.522 --> 00:49:50.943]  It'll say six weeks for delivery.
[00:49:50.943 --> 00:49:52.063]  I don't want to get involved in that.
[00:49:52.363 --> 00:49:52.423]  800-409-5633.
[00:49:52.423 --> 00:49:52.483]  800-409-5633.
[00:49:52.483 --> 00:49:54.263]  And on the two-month grab-and-go, Alex, it's next-day shipment.
[00:50:20.738 --> 00:50:22.339]  Absolutely, folks.
[00:50:22.339 --> 00:50:24.199]  Again, it'll last more than 10 years.
[00:50:24.199 --> 00:50:25.400]  It's good to have it regardless.
[00:50:25.400 --> 00:50:26.220]  It's great insurance.
[00:50:26.220 --> 00:50:27.381]  Everybody needs to have it.
[00:50:27.381 --> 00:50:29.882]  Thank you so much for spending time with us, Steve.
[00:50:29.882 --> 00:50:30.942]  Take care, Alex.
[00:50:30.942 --> 00:50:32.103]  There goes Steve Schenck, folks.
[00:50:32.103 --> 00:50:37.085]  Great people, high quality, clean, non-GMO food.
[00:50:37.085 --> 00:50:38.005]  efoodsdirect.com.
[00:50:38.005 --> 00:50:46.128]  Okay, we're going to come back in more to the financial news, and then we're scheduled to have Jordan Maxwell on with us, and then Congressman Charles Key.
[00:50:46.128 --> 00:50:47.869]  Big show lined up in the next three hours.
[00:50:55.189 --> 00:50:59.793]  Another Untold Story, here it comes.
[00:50:59.793 --> 00:51:04.356]  Another Untold Story, here it comes.
[00:51:04.356 --> 00:51:11.141]  Another Untold Story that you have not been told from AnotherUntoldStory.com
[00:51:14.025 --> 00:51:15.626]  Victoria's Secret.
[00:51:15.626 --> 00:51:20.347]  Have you begun to wonder what it is, or shall we say, what they are?
[00:51:20.347 --> 00:51:27.190]  On previous Another Untold Story broadcasts, we'd mentioned the first two suspected secrets.
[00:51:27.190 --> 00:51:32.412]  But frankly, we hesitate to mention the third suspected secret.
[00:51:32.412 --> 00:51:34.693]  It's just too unbelievable.
[00:51:34.693 --> 00:51:37.474]  It seems like it's out of a science fiction story.
[00:51:38.294 --> 00:51:42.137]  Ever heard the expression, truth is stranger than fiction?
[00:51:42.137 --> 00:51:51.463]  Ever think maybe science fiction is told so that when you discover truth, you cannot believe it because it sounds like fiction?
[00:51:51.463 --> 00:51:57.867]  How many science fiction stories have you heard, read, or seen where aliens look like people?
[00:51:57.867 --> 00:51:58.968]  Lots.
[00:51:58.968 --> 00:52:02.330]  But what if it were true and you heard it?
[00:52:02.330 --> 00:52:02.611]  Well,
[00:52:03.450 --> 00:52:06.171]  You couldn't believe it because it sounds like fiction.
[00:52:06.171 --> 00:52:08.472]  That only happens in the movies.
[00:52:08.472 --> 00:52:19.698]  There is told of a prophecy in the greatest storybook written of, and I quote, I will make them jealous with those who are not a people, end quote.
[00:52:19.698 --> 00:52:20.478]  People.
[00:52:20.478 --> 00:52:23.159]  Could this be part of Victoria's Secret?

[00:52:53.638 --> 00:53:06.782]  Now from the makers of Loose Change, the most downloaded film in internet history, comes the long-awaited release of Loose Change Final Cut, an entirely new two-hour film that completely destroys the official fable forever.
[00:53:06.782 --> 00:53:17.845]  Loose Change Final Cut hopes to be a catalyst for a new independent investigation in which family members receive answers to their questions and the true perpetrators of this horrendous crime are brought to justice.
[00:53:17.845 --> 00:53:20.086]  Loose Change Final Cut is the ultimate 9-11 expose.
[00:53:21.246 --> 00:53:23.007]  From hijackers being trained at U.S.
[00:53:23.007 --> 00:53:29.129]  military bases to bombs in the buildings, Loose Change Final Cut is the one 9-11 film everyone must see.

[00:53:44.775 --> 00:53:47.416]  We're in a no-holds-bar information war.
[00:53:47.416 --> 00:54:05.605]  Truth is our weapon, and PrisonPlanet.com has the tools you need to take the fight back to Big Brother.
[00:54:05.605 --> 00:54:07.806]  All those drifters days are past me now.
[00:54:12.345 --> 00:54:14.185]  We were young and strong.
[00:54:42.039 --> 00:54:50.105]  But we were still running against the wind.
[00:54:50.105 --> 00:54:51.066]  Against the wind.
[00:54:51.066 --> 00:54:56.450]  And the New World Order is running against the wind.
[00:54:56.450 --> 00:55:01.374]  Their evil will be punished.
[00:55:01.374 --> 00:55:05.597]  Their tyranny will fall.
[00:55:05.597 --> 00:55:08.199]  Their system is destined from its foundations to fall.
[00:55:09.969 --> 00:55:17.691]  Continuing here with the news, oil reaches $142 on view, dollar will keep falling.
[00:55:17.691 --> 00:55:22.912]  And then an insane story out of the London Telegraph.
[00:55:22.912 --> 00:55:25.713]  These are the real big financial papers.
[00:55:25.713 --> 00:55:39.456]  You notice when Brent Scrocoff, former National Security Advisor, top globalist, wanted to talk bad about Bush and say he was being handled by the Israelis in World War III, he wrote his letter to the Financial Times of London.
[00:55:41.260 --> 00:55:43.823]  That's the true paper of record globally.
[00:55:43.823 --> 00:55:49.270]  It's not the Wall Street Journal, it is not the New York Times, but a similar paper, the London Telegraph today.
[00:55:49.270 --> 00:55:54.376]  Barclays warns a financial storm as Federal Reserve's credibility crumbles.
[00:55:57.039 --> 00:56:00.521]  When they start talking like that, it means they're going to pin it on the Federal Reserve.
[00:56:00.521 --> 00:56:15.608]  From the beginning, Bernanke, though I loathe him, he's a puppet himself, and he's going to have it all pinned on him while all these fools hail the private Federal Reserve former chieftain, Alan Greenspan, when it was his actions that destroyed the dollar.
[00:56:15.608 --> 00:56:17.269]  Deliberately.
[00:56:17.269 --> 00:56:18.970]  See, these things are delayed.
[00:56:18.970 --> 00:56:21.151]  Bernanke's been in for a year and a half, almost two years.
[00:56:23.715 --> 00:56:23.955]  U.S.
[00:56:23.955 --> 00:56:33.518]  Central Bank accused of unleashing an inflation shock that will rock financial markets, reports Ambrose Evans Pritchard.
[00:56:33.518 --> 00:56:34.178]  And that's it.
[00:56:34.178 --> 00:56:42.140]  It is a... How did the Fed release an inflation bomb?
[00:56:42.140 --> 00:56:45.841]  By issuing basically unlimited credit to their buddies.
[00:56:45.841 --> 00:56:51.843]  See, a shadow of all of their looting is giving loans to people that didn't have jobs and didn't have credit.
[00:56:53.203 --> 00:56:55.604]  That's a small part of this.
[00:56:55.604 --> 00:57:06.907]  They gave it to other corporations and companies to buy up real assets, then they shell those to other assets, to other companies that they hold, and then blow out and bankrupt the dummy front company.
[00:57:06.907 --> 00:57:16.510]  Basically, that's been done millions of times upon millions of times by their financial infrastructure, and they are designing all of this to leave us holding the bag.
[00:57:16.510 --> 00:57:22.292]  That's what you're not going to read in the Times of London, the Sunday Times of London, the Financial Times, the London Telegraph.
[00:57:24.113 --> 00:57:31.036]  Barclays Capital has advised clients to batten down the hatches for a worldwide financial storm.
[00:57:31.036 --> 00:57:34.258]  Oh, I thought the last storm was six months ago.
[00:57:34.258 --> 00:57:35.378]  Warning that the U.S.
[00:57:35.378 --> 00:57:44.122]  Federal Reserve has allowed the inflation genie out of the bottle and let its credibility fall below zero.
[00:57:44.122 --> 00:57:49.665]  We're in a nasty environment, said Tim Bond, the bank chief equity strategist.
[00:57:49.665 --> 00:57:51.526]  There is an inflation shock underway.
[00:57:52.850 --> 00:57:56.851]  This is going to be very negative for financial assets.
[00:57:56.851 --> 00:58:06.793]  We are going to tortoise mode and we are re-entering into our shell.
[00:58:06.793 --> 00:58:10.734]  Investors will do well if they can preserve their wealth.
[00:58:10.734 --> 00:58:13.215]  Investors will do well.
[00:58:14.196 --> 00:58:16.758]  If they can preserve their wealth.
[00:58:16.758 --> 00:58:18.879]  We'll come back, finish up on the financials.
[00:58:18.879 --> 00:58:22.962]  Then we'll talk about who's running it all with our guest, Jordan Maxwell.
[00:58:22.962 --> 00:58:24.042]  It's not Monday.
[00:58:24.042 --> 00:58:24.643]  It's Friday.
[00:58:24.643 --> 00:58:26.304]  It's a new live interview.
[00:58:26.304 --> 00:58:26.824]  Coming up.
[00:58:26.824 --> 00:58:27.645]  Tell everybody you know.
[00:58:27.645 --> 00:58:34.509]  Stay with us.

[00:58:43.737 --> 00:58:45.698]  Our beloved Republic is on her knees.
[00:58:45.698 --> 00:58:49.319]  The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide.
[00:58:49.319 --> 00:58:51.440]  But in Liberty's darkest hour, there is hope.
[00:58:51.440 --> 00:58:54.801]  For the first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[00:58:54.801 --> 00:59:00.543]  It is essential that Patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding of the New World Order Master Plan.
[00:59:00.543 --> 00:59:04.444]  We have a short time frame to fully awaken and energize the people to meet this threat.

[00:59:48.761 --> 00:59:51.522]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:58.479 --> 01:00:00.220]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:00.220 --> 01:00:01.800]  You want answers?
[01:00:01.800 --> 01:00:02.721]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:02.721 --> 01:00:07.563]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:07.563 --> 01:00:15.226]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:15.226 --> 01:00:23.309]  Daily Mail headline, Wall Street plunges towards worst month since Great Depression of the early 1930s on inflation worries.
[01:00:25.464 --> 01:00:27.086]  London Telegraph reports U.S.
[01:00:27.086 --> 01:00:33.152]  Central Bank accused of unleashing an inflation shock that will rock financial markets, reports Ambrose Evans-Britchers.
[01:00:33.152 --> 01:00:39.959]  Barclays Capital has advised clients to batten down the hatches for a worldwide financial storm.
[01:00:39.959 --> 01:00:40.780]  Warning that U.S.
[01:00:40.780 --> 01:00:47.047]  Federal Reserve has allowed the inflation genie out of the bottle and let its credibility fall to zero.
[01:00:48.649 --> 01:00:50.830]  We're in a nasty environment, said Tim Bond.
[01:00:50.830 --> 01:00:52.871]  Barclays is about as respected as it gets, folks.
[01:00:52.871 --> 01:00:54.312]  The bank's chief equity strategist.
[01:00:54.312 --> 01:00:58.133]  There is an inflation shock underway.
[01:00:58.133 --> 01:01:01.395]  This is going to be very negative for financial assets.
[01:01:01.395 --> 01:01:06.377]  And we're going into the tortoise mode and are retreating into our shell.
[01:01:06.377 --> 01:01:12.740]  Quote, investors will do well if they can preserve their wealth.
[01:01:12.740 --> 01:01:13.200]  You hear that?
[01:01:13.200 --> 01:01:14.701]  You will do well if you can preserve it.
[01:01:15.276 --> 01:01:16.096]  Preserve it!
[01:01:16.096 --> 01:01:17.637]  Wealth preservation!
[01:01:17.637 --> 01:01:19.618]  This is the London Telegraph today.
[01:01:19.618 --> 01:01:23.179]  Headline up on PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:01:23.179 --> 01:01:25.480]  Barclays Capital said it's closely watched global outlook.
[01:01:25.480 --> 01:01:25.880]  The U.S.
[01:01:25.880 --> 01:01:34.223]  headline inflation would massively expand in August and the Fed will have to raise interest rates six times by the end of the year to prevent a wage spiral.
[01:01:35.149 --> 01:01:38.570]  If it hastens, the bond markets will take matters into their own hands.
[01:01:38.570 --> 01:01:43.091]  This is the first test for banks in 30 years that they will have to fulfill it.
[01:01:43.091 --> 01:01:48.152]  They have zero credibility, and the Fed is negative.
[01:01:48.152 --> 01:01:49.912]  If that's possible.
[01:01:49.912 --> 01:01:51.993]  It has lost all credibility, Mr. Bond said.
[01:01:51.993 --> 01:01:55.133]  Let me read you this again.
[01:01:55.133 --> 01:02:01.755]  Chief Strategist for... and Chief Equity Strategist for Barclays.
[01:02:01.755 --> 01:02:02.695]  Let me read that to you again.
[01:02:03.391 --> 01:02:06.113]  Investors will do well if they can preserve their wealth.
[01:02:06.113 --> 01:02:08.255]  I'm only having Ted on for two minutes.
[01:02:08.255 --> 01:02:11.558]  He literally is giving you these gold deals at cost.
[01:02:11.558 --> 01:02:15.841]  Ted, I think, makes like 2-3% to pay his brokers and just get the order out the door.
[01:02:15.841 --> 01:02:20.645]  And he's doing this to introduce you to real metals and to protection.
[01:02:20.645 --> 01:02:24.268]  Now, Bloomberg and everybody else are saying it's going to go up to $5,000 an ounce.
[01:02:24.268 --> 01:02:25.369]  I'm not saying that.
[01:02:25.369 --> 01:02:27.711]  Gold's way up again today.
[01:02:27.711 --> 01:02:28.492]  And this is the summer.
[01:02:28.492 --> 01:02:29.353]  We've never seen this.
[01:02:30.402 --> 01:02:32.823]  So, wait till the fall.
[01:02:32.823 --> 01:02:34.584]  Now is the time to buy.
[01:02:34.584 --> 01:02:38.326]  And it is shooting up right now, but Ted has it at the price it was two days ago.
[01:02:38.326 --> 01:02:43.469]  Ted, A, can you hold the Swiss franc through the weekend?
[01:02:43.469 --> 01:02:51.494]  I told you I would, and I'm gonna, even if I have to take a loss, which it kind of looks like I will, but I would suggest that everybody gets involved in the precious metals at this time.
[01:02:51.494 --> 01:02:53.815]  Handwriting's on the wall, it's boiling right now.
[01:02:53.815 --> 01:02:57.057]  All the financial analysts are saying the same thing, just like you said.
[01:02:57.677 --> 01:02:59.118]  You better get moving on it.
[01:02:59.118 --> 01:02:59.518]  I do.
[01:02:59.518 --> 01:03:00.899]  I have those.
[01:03:00.899 --> 01:03:04.921]  Francs right now are currently at $194 apiece.
[01:03:04.921 --> 01:03:07.982]  That is a steal, especially with gold prices now where they are.
[01:03:07.982 --> 01:03:10.844]  Now $243 for the British Sovereign coin.
[01:03:10.844 --> 01:03:16.587]  Again, that's the same price I offered them for when gold was at $88 three days ago with you.
[01:03:16.587 --> 01:03:24.031]  Right now, those rolls of walking liberties are, again, just a steal at $182 per roll of $20.
[01:03:26.652 --> 01:03:27.913]  Preservation of capital.
[01:03:27.913 --> 01:03:31.655]  I mean, finally they're waking up and saying it.
[01:03:31.655 --> 01:03:34.937]  We should have been preserving our capital three years ago.
[01:03:34.937 --> 01:03:37.779]  And this is, you know, we'll be lucky just to be able to hold on to what we have.
[01:03:37.779 --> 01:03:41.061]  And that is going to accelerate the snowball, all this bad news.
[01:03:41.061 --> 01:03:42.262]  I can't believe they're telling the truth.
[01:03:42.262 --> 01:03:44.944]  I mean, I have AP saying the same thing today.
[01:03:44.944 --> 01:03:45.924]  Give them the number, Ted.
[01:03:45.924 --> 01:03:46.885]  People need to call now.
[01:03:47.225 --> 01:03:51.347]  Yeah, it's 1-800-686-2237.
[01:03:51.347 --> 01:03:54.269]  Again, it's 1-800-686-2237.
[01:03:54.269 --> 01:03:58.291]  The numbers are, you know, people are calling like crazy.
[01:03:58.291 --> 01:03:59.232]  Get your orders in.
[01:03:59.232 --> 01:04:01.853]  We'll get these things out the door to you real fast.
[01:04:01.853 --> 01:04:07.516]  You'll have them in your hand and you'll be putting off an economic storm here that's coming.
[01:04:07.516 --> 01:04:08.917]  We already have the thunderclouds.
[01:04:08.917 --> 01:04:10.638]  They're like just rolling overhead right now.
[01:04:10.638 --> 01:04:12.339]  There's no reason not to get into this stuff.
[01:04:13.550 --> 01:04:21.945]  Well, I mean, even if gold isn't going to explode, which clearly the experts are all saying it is, the question is, will it be $2,500 or $5,000 in the next two years?
[01:04:21.945 --> 01:04:24.349]  And this could boil up any time, folks.
[01:04:24.349 --> 01:04:26.413]  We're sitting on top of a bunch of nitroglycerin with a
[01:04:27.256 --> 01:04:30.980]  Topless dancer dancing around in spiked heels on top of it on the table.
[01:04:30.980 --> 01:04:34.904]  Well, I mean, what if the financial institutions you have your investments in fail?
[01:04:34.904 --> 01:04:36.485]  I mean, just think of that right there.
[01:04:36.485 --> 01:04:39.428]  Or let me say somebody's beating on a bottle of nitroglycerin with a hammer.
[01:04:39.428 --> 01:04:39.908]  800-686-2237.
[01:04:39.908 --> 01:04:44.853]  There'll be brokers there all weekend until midnight every night.
[01:04:44.853 --> 01:04:45.274]  800-686-2237.
[01:04:45.274 --> 01:04:46.995]  Thanks, Ted.
[01:04:46.995 --> 01:04:48.837]  Thanks, Alex.
[01:04:48.837 --> 01:04:49.077]  You bet.
[01:04:49.077 --> 01:04:49.578]  We'll be right back.

[01:06:07.832 --> 01:06:13.076]  When the dollar and economy crash, when the imported and genetically poisoned food is all that's left,
[01:06:13.736 --> 01:06:22.299]  When the quarantine and bird flu hit, our only protection and only chance to be fearless is having control of our own supply of food and enough of it.
[01:06:22.299 --> 01:06:30.501]  But if you knew what we haven't yet discovered, you wouldn't waste time listening to the rest of this announcement before charging out and getting a serious food supply.
[01:06:30.501 --> 01:06:33.722]  Decide, it's food now or probably never.
[01:06:33.722 --> 01:06:35.003]  But can you afford to be wrong?
[01:06:35.703 --> 01:06:36.863]  Decide now.
[01:06:36.863 --> 01:06:38.444]  Place your bet.
[01:06:38.444 --> 01:06:40.284]  Can you afford to be wrong?
[01:06:40.284 --> 01:06:41.705]  Call 800-409-5633 on the web efoodsdirect.com.
[01:06:41.705 --> 01:06:41.865]  Call 800-409-5633.
[01:06:41.865 --> 01:06:42.365]  It is a big idea.
[01:06:42.365 --> 01:06:44.365]  A new world order in the near future.
[01:06:57.515 --> 01:07:00.578]  Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[01:07:00.578 --> 01:07:03.420]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[01:07:03.420 --> 01:07:06.202]  Could their objective be world domination?
[01:07:06.202 --> 01:07:09.385]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[01:07:09.385 --> 01:07:16.711]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[01:07:19.721 --> 01:07:25.185]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[01:07:25.185 --> 01:07:29.107]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.

[01:07:52.202 --> 01:07:58.824]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:07:58.824 --> 01:08:03.725]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:03.725 --> 01:08:10.387]  For the next hour and 55 minutes, roughly, Jordan Maxwell is our guest.
[01:08:10.387 --> 01:08:14.508]  We had him on Monday for close to three hours, and people really loved it, and I thought, why wait?
[01:08:14.508 --> 01:08:16.589]  Why not have Jordan back up on the show?
[01:08:18.519 --> 01:08:27.466]  Now this hour we're just going to talk about whatever issues he wants to discuss, and then the next hour we're going to open the phones up for Jordan Maxwell here on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:27.466 --> 01:08:28.727]  Don't forget my new film,

[01:08:33.087 --> 01:08:34.488]  That's next week.

[01:08:51.881 --> 01:08:53.862]  It is the history of the 9-11 Truth Movement.
[01:08:53.862 --> 01:09:04.684]  We Are Change confronting all these globalists, taking over their media events, and showing how the first responders were poisoned by the dust, how the government knowingly covered it up, and then their quest to get treatment.
[01:09:04.684 --> 01:09:05.765]  Very important film.
[01:09:05.765 --> 01:09:07.745]  Cinema Verite, unlike any film I've ever made.
[01:09:07.745 --> 01:09:09.686]  I'm very proud of Truth Rising.
[01:09:09.686 --> 01:09:10.426]  Available right now.
[01:09:11.426 --> 01:09:17.350]  at Infowars.com or by calling 888-253-3139.
[01:09:17.350 --> 01:09:20.272]  JordanMaxwell.com is the website.
[01:09:20.272 --> 01:09:23.415]  Jordan, did you get a big response when you came on the show Monday?
[01:09:23.415 --> 01:09:24.355]  Oh, did I ever?
[01:09:24.355 --> 01:09:26.657]  Yeah, thank you very much for that.
[01:09:26.657 --> 01:09:30.700]  Just tremendous outpouring and I appreciate everybody.
[01:09:30.700 --> 01:09:40.867]  That was one of the things I wanted to say, that I cannot get back to everyone, you know, who has emailed and called me because I'm just inundated with emails and
[01:09:41.624 --> 01:09:48.208]  But I really appreciate everybody and everything that everyone has been saying, so I thank everybody for that.
[01:09:48.208 --> 01:09:52.490]  Well, you were telling me during the break that it may have been the biggest response you ever got on radio?
[01:09:52.490 --> 01:10:08.819]  Yeah, it very well could be the biggest response I've ever received because, you know, my website, I guess, went down about three different times, and my webman is very good at taking care of those problems, but he just couldn't keep up with it because it kept going down.
[01:10:09.634 --> 01:10:19.437]  And so we've had to go to a new server, you know, that can take that kind of a hit because I got a tremendous amount of hits on the web, you know, on the website.
[01:10:19.437 --> 01:10:22.278]  So hopefully that won't happen anymore.
[01:10:22.278 --> 01:10:29.580]  I've had problems with, you know, with actually being shut down by NSA and security.
[01:10:29.580 --> 01:10:37.823]  Police have shut my site down on occasions and really destroyed my email, but that was done, you know, a few years ago, back in 2005.
[01:10:39.838 --> 01:10:45.207]  I think the problems I had with your program was the fact that it just had so many hits.
[01:10:45.207 --> 01:10:46.729]  So I think that's been taken care of.
[01:10:46.729 --> 01:10:47.951]  We've got a bigger server now.
[01:10:51.503 --> 01:10:56.607]  I want you in the next hour and 50 minutes to talk about any subjects you want, and first do that.
[01:10:56.607 --> 01:11:03.871]  But I want to get more into the Globalist Master Plan, more of what drives them, what the world will look like if they have their way.
[01:11:03.871 --> 01:11:06.993]  Expand on your 50 years of research.
[01:11:06.993 --> 01:11:13.938]  You're saying that you believe they are trying to mutate humanity, and now they even say that in declassified documents, two species.
[01:11:13.938 --> 01:11:14.919]  So I want to get into that as
[01:11:15.559 --> 01:11:16.739]  Well, I appreciate that.
[01:11:16.739 --> 01:11:20.201]  I really thank you for the opportunity of getting some things off my chest.
[01:11:20.201 --> 01:11:22.261]  It's been bothering me for a long time.
[01:11:22.261 --> 01:11:22.921]  First of all,
[01:11:39.136 --> 01:11:45.039]  I get a lot of phone calls and emails from people who say, I sent you an email and you didn't answer.
[01:11:45.039 --> 01:11:47.981]  I called you, but you didn't call me back.
[01:11:47.981 --> 01:11:56.925]  Uh, you know, I get anywhere from 50 to 60 phone calls a day and I get like two or 300 emails a day, every day.
[01:11:56.925 --> 01:11:59.786]  So it's like a 1500 a week.
[01:11:59.786 --> 01:12:04.588]  Uh, I live by myself with my brother in two rooms and I don't have a secretary.
[01:12:04.588 --> 01:12:07.630]  I don't have, uh, you know, a big, uh,
[01:12:08.966 --> 01:12:16.231]  Uh, background of people to help me get out, uh, emails and, you know, correspond with people.
[01:12:16.231 --> 01:12:17.692]  It's just me by myself.
[01:12:17.692 --> 01:12:18.833]  I don't have a secretary.
[01:12:18.833 --> 01:12:20.635]  I don't have anybody to answer emails.
[01:12:20.635 --> 01:12:22.636]  And I'm almost 70 years old.
[01:12:22.636 --> 01:12:27.419]  I don't type to start with, and I don't know that much about computers to begin with.
[01:12:27.419 --> 01:12:33.924]  So, and then I get a lot of people saying, well, did you get this email that did you get this, uh, picture I sent?
[01:12:33.924 --> 01:12:37.707]  Uh, yeah, I get, I get tons of stuff every day, uh, continually.
[01:12:38.436 --> 01:12:41.637]  But I don't have the ability to get back to everyone.
[01:12:41.637 --> 01:12:50.701]  Well because you brought this up let me say something about it because this is one of the few areas where we can say we've experienced the exact same thing.
[01:12:50.701 --> 01:12:51.822]  People will get mad.
[01:12:52.469 --> 01:12:53.050]  Yeah, I know.
[01:13:14.208 --> 01:13:24.960]  But there's so much of it that we could never respond to it all unless it was an automatic response email back, and that's what the politicians do.
[01:13:24.960 --> 01:13:34.490]  And Jordan's a sensitive, nice, intelligent fella, and I can tell it hurts his feelings when that happens, but the public is getting more and more crass, myself included.
[01:13:34.970 --> 01:13:36.151]  No doubt about it.
[01:13:36.151 --> 01:13:37.112]  Less and less gentlemanly.
[01:13:37.112 --> 01:13:37.932]  You're very gentlemanly.
[01:13:37.932 --> 01:13:39.794]  I'm probably not to some extent.
[01:13:39.794 --> 01:13:50.121]  You know, we're becoming more and more ogre-like, and so a gentleman like you, I think, you know, it's frustrating, but you just gotta get a thicker skin, Jordan, because, you know, it's not gonna stop.
[01:13:50.121 --> 01:13:51.022]  Well, I know.
[01:13:51.022 --> 01:13:51.302]  I know.
[01:13:51.302 --> 01:14:02.710]  I try and answer everybody, but like I said, most people don't know, and I don't mind putting myself on the line, and, you know, I'm not trying to present myself to the world as anything but who I am.
[01:14:03.688 --> 01:14:06.669]  I live with my brother in two rooms with no shower.
[01:14:06.669 --> 01:14:08.930]  I just live by myself.
[01:14:08.930 --> 01:14:15.273]  I don't have anybody here to help me do anything, and I've been very, very sick for a long time.
[01:14:15.273 --> 01:14:17.694]  My brother's even sicker than I am.
[01:14:17.694 --> 01:14:22.717]  And so I get, like I said, hundreds of emails a day from all over the world.
[01:14:22.717 --> 01:14:28.479]  And another thing is that people email me, but they don't tell me where they are emailing from.
[01:14:28.479 --> 01:14:30.360]  I don't want a particular address.
[01:14:31.078 --> 01:14:40.125]  But I would like to know what country, or what state, or what city, because I get emails from all over the world, but, you know, it could be from down the street, or it could be in South Africa.
[01:14:40.125 --> 01:14:41.846]  I don't know.
[01:14:41.846 --> 01:14:49.573]  And so, I would like to know where emails are coming from, and I'd like for people to know that I read everything.
[01:14:49.573 --> 01:15:00.261]  I sit here for hours and go through all the emails, and on occasions, I'll even answer them if I feel it's important, and I... that I do that, I'll try and answer them, but, you know,
[01:15:00.774 --> 01:15:02.435]  Hundreds a day with no help.
[01:15:02.435 --> 01:15:04.177]  It's just very difficult.
[01:15:04.177 --> 01:15:07.660]  And yes, I get people actually threatening that.
[01:15:07.660 --> 01:15:09.882]  And here's another problem.
[01:15:09.882 --> 01:15:22.032]  People will go out and buy a video of mine, and then they reproduce it and put it out on the market under a different name, and begin selling it all over the world.
[01:15:22.032 --> 01:15:26.896]  And then I get emails and phone calls from people saying, where is the product I ordered?
[01:15:27.555 --> 01:15:29.496]  We're going to report you to the authorities.
[01:15:29.496 --> 01:15:31.337]  We're going to report you to Better Business Bureau.
[01:15:31.337 --> 01:15:34.319]  Yeah, we have that all the time.
[01:15:34.319 --> 01:15:41.183]  That's the nature of all this, where people mail in bootleg copies of my films demanding more copies or something.
[01:15:41.183 --> 01:15:48.347]  But Jordan, again, I'm happy to air all this here on air, but I just don't think... I mean, it's kind of like the Dutch boy trying to hold back the flood.
[01:15:48.347 --> 01:15:49.447]  Yeah, I think you're right.
[01:15:49.447 --> 01:15:55.611]  I know it just bothers me terrible that people assume that I don't care and just assume that I
[01:15:56.403 --> 01:16:03.368]  I am not answering them, and one guy wrote me and said, you're obviously not answering me because I have a Jewish last name.
[01:16:03.368 --> 01:16:05.490]  I mean, that's ludicrous.
[01:16:05.490 --> 01:16:09.653]  And so, you know, I'm just voicing my concern.
[01:16:09.653 --> 01:16:21.142]  Of course, on the other hand, I want to also talk about the fact of what I believe about God, because Lord knows there's so much out there pro and con about me concerning my faith.
[01:16:22.694 --> 01:16:28.338]  First of all, I am not anti-God, I'm not anti-Christ, I'm not anti-anything.
[01:16:28.338 --> 01:16:35.203]  I have a highest of respect for what we would refer to as God.
[01:16:35.203 --> 01:16:43.689]  I believe, and my belief about God is that there is a very powerful, divine spirit in the universe.
[01:16:43.689 --> 01:16:50.974]  And that spirit is wise, intelligent, and powerful, and I have the highest of respect and honor for
[01:16:51.710 --> 01:16:53.792]  The Superior Spirit
[01:17:09.375 --> 01:17:14.878]  Different ways and God is, like I always say, God is simply dog spelled backwards.
[01:17:14.878 --> 01:17:21.122]  And then men claim that they own that thing called God and then claim you've got to follow them and make themselves God.
[01:17:21.122 --> 01:17:22.282]  And I see that everywhere.
[01:17:22.282 --> 01:17:23.403]  They claim you're an atheist.
[01:17:23.403 --> 01:17:24.624]  They claim you believe in this and that.
[01:17:24.624 --> 01:17:26.085]  And I know Jordan Maxwell.
[01:17:26.085 --> 01:17:29.186]  I've interviewed him many times and read and seen his work.
[01:17:29.186 --> 01:17:30.127]  That's not what he's saying.
[01:17:30.127 --> 01:17:32.848]  He's saying that what you're told is Christianity.
[01:17:32.848 --> 01:17:38.952]  What you're told are these different religions is really just a repackaging of this mystery school.
[01:17:39.392 --> 01:17:40.352]  That's exactly right.
[01:17:40.352 --> 01:17:44.153]  And consequently, I have the highest of regard for it.
[01:17:44.153 --> 01:17:51.455]  I've got over 40 Bibles in my collection.
[01:17:51.455 --> 01:17:53.156]  I'm a student of theology.
[01:17:53.156 --> 01:17:57.697]  I've loved theology, especially the New Testament.
[01:17:57.697 --> 01:18:06.919]  And I believe that the Bible, especially the New Testament, is just jam-packed with wisdom and knowledge and understanding.
[01:18:07.646 --> 01:18:13.968]  I have no problem with anything that Jesus is reputed to have said or is recorded to have said.
[01:18:13.968 --> 01:18:16.869]  I live by those principles.
[01:18:16.869 --> 01:18:29.294]  All I'm saying is that there is a whole world of occult or hidden knowledge, which most people are not privy to even know exists, which I have studied all of my life.
[01:18:29.294 --> 01:18:32.735]  And so I look at things differently.
[01:18:32.735 --> 01:18:35.156]  I look at where it was written, what culture
[01:18:35.797 --> 01:18:41.404]  wrote it, where it originally came from, the etymology of the words.
[01:18:41.404 --> 01:18:47.992]  So I have the highest of regard for spirituality and for what is written in the Bible, the words of Jesus.
[01:18:47.992 --> 01:18:49.554]  I live by those.
[01:18:49.554 --> 01:18:51.637]  So I'm not anti-God, I'm not anti-
[01:18:52.969 --> 01:19:03.533]  But, you want to tell people that outside of Baptist Church, a steeple is a phallic symbol, and is not worshipping the God you're told.
[01:19:03.533 --> 01:19:04.573]  That's exactly right.
[01:19:04.573 --> 01:19:10.155]  And most of those Masonic preachers know that, and it's a big joke to them, isn't it, Jordan?
[01:19:10.155 --> 01:19:10.776]  It is.
[01:19:10.776 --> 01:19:11.136]  It is.
[01:19:11.136 --> 01:19:17.698]  And I've sat with rabbis, I've sat with priests, because that's what I do.
[01:19:17.698 --> 01:19:20.019]  And I'm sitting with all of these people who are
[01:19:20.629 --> 01:19:31.914]  ...major names in theology, religion, and research, and they all smile and say, yeah, I know, yeah, I know, well, but, you know, the people need something, so we just tell them what they want to hear.
[01:19:31.914 --> 01:19:34.375]  And, uh, I'm just amazed with that.
[01:19:34.375 --> 01:19:36.876]  I said, why don't you tell them the truth?
[01:19:36.876 --> 01:19:39.216]  That's even more startling.
[01:19:39.216 --> 01:19:42.098]  And they said, the people don't want the truth.
[01:19:42.098 --> 01:19:44.939]  The people want to hear what they want to hear.
[01:19:44.939 --> 01:19:46.279]  Jordan Maxwell, stay there.
[01:19:46.279 --> 01:19:48.020]  We'll be right back in just one moment.
[01:19:51.041 --> 01:19:51.822]  Gold.
[01:19:51.822 --> 01:19:53.363]  It's like nothing else on Earth.
[01:19:53.363 --> 01:19:59.648]  From the Romans through the Renaissance, from the Industrial Age to the Space Age, gold has weathered the test of time.
[01:19:59.648 --> 01:20:03.812]  For 6,000 years, gold has remained the ultimate store of wealth.
[01:20:03.812 --> 01:20:05.753]  According to the World Gold Council and the U.S.
[01:20:05.753 --> 01:20:08.196]  Mint, demand is at an all-time high.
[01:20:08.196 --> 01:20:14.541]  The stage is being set for the reemergence of gold as the common-sense alternative to a fiat paper currency that gets
[01:20:14.701 --> 01:20:15.241]  We're good to go.
[01:20:44.419 --> 01:20:46.062]  You must read this report.
[01:20:46.062 --> 01:20:47.104]  Call Midas today at 800-686-2237
[01:20:51.127 --> 01:20:54.910]  It is now time to reign in evil and bring them to justice.
[01:20:54.910 --> 01:20:59.935]  Through the authority that has been delegated to us, it is time to destroy the destroyers.
[01:20:59.935 --> 01:21:05.400]  The number of the mounted troops was 200 million, the vast majority of the population of the U.S.
[01:21:05.400 --> 01:21:15.909]  Though the people of the U.S., where their numbers and influence are strongest, have primary responsibility for reigning them in and bringing them to justice, all nations will participate since they reside the world over.
[01:21:16.389 --> 01:21:20.770]  They are called Illuminati, elite, proponents of the New World Order.
[01:21:20.770 --> 01:21:23.551]  They oppose everything that is God and Truth.
[01:21:23.551 --> 01:21:27.131]  They are of the line that was disinherited 2,000 years ago.
[01:21:27.131 --> 01:21:39.634]  Everything they have built over the centuries, the wealth they have accumulated, the power they have established, the poisoning of the masses, the destruction of the Earth and mankind, we will undo through the authority that has now been delegated to us.

[01:21:43.842 --> 01:21:48.150]  That's U-N-V-E-I-L-I-N-G them dot com.
[01:21:48.150 --> 01:21:49.412]  The message of His Kingdom.
[01:21:51.485 --> 01:21:57.572]  Did you know the accumulation of acidic waste in the body is the single largest cause of disease such as cancer or diabetes?
[01:21:57.572 --> 01:22:03.518]  Acidic waste is created by the types of food we eat, what we drink, the environment, and our high-stress lifestyles.
[01:22:03.518 --> 01:22:07.683]  It's these choices that cause decreased energy, weight gain, and eventually disease.
[01:22:07.683 --> 01:22:12.588]  The easiest way to reduce disease-causing acidic waste is by drinking alkaline ionized water.
[01:22:12.788 --> 01:22:13.289]  We're good to go.
[01:22:27.725 --> 01:22:28.245]  I think so.
[01:22:50.137 --> 01:22:52.998]  Terror Storm, a history of government-sponsored terror.
[01:22:52.998 --> 01:22:54.558]  Loose Change Final Cut.
[01:22:54.558 --> 01:22:56.699]  Endgame, blueprint for global enslavement.
[01:22:56.699 --> 01:22:58.599]  The true story of the Bilderberg Group.
[01:22:58.599 --> 01:23:00.080]  The late great USA.
[01:23:00.080 --> 01:23:01.860]  America, freedom to fascism.
[01:23:01.860 --> 01:23:08.882]  These are just a few of the hundreds of powerful documentary films and books available at truthnews.us and prisonplanet.com.

[01:24:05.504 --> 01:24:16.953]  Do you have a secret society that has governed the world for thousands of years?
[01:24:16.953 --> 01:24:19.255]  They know all the secrets.
[01:24:19.255 --> 01:24:21.957]  They know if Atlantis was real.
[01:24:36.363 --> 01:24:41.868]  They know who built the pyramids.
[01:24:41.868 --> 01:24:44.931]  They have a lot of advanced knowledge.
[01:24:44.931 --> 01:24:49.194]  It's mainline history that NASA was founded by deep occultists.
[01:24:49.194 --> 01:24:51.657]  Everything they do is occultic.
[01:24:51.657 --> 01:25:00.685]  Now we're getting evidence that NASA was involved in the World Trade Center attacks with the thermate that comes from one of their developments.
[01:25:00.685 --> 01:25:03.047]  I mean, it's just all interconnected and we have
[01:25:04.790 --> 01:25:13.253]  We have this group who has the knowledge, and they have all their little subsidiaries and only have part of the knowledge, waging war on humanity.
[01:25:13.253 --> 01:25:15.494]  Jordan Maxwell, there's so much to talk about.
[01:25:15.494 --> 01:25:22.196]  Where should we start trying to unlock minds and explain to people the nature of what we face?
[01:25:22.196 --> 01:25:26.117]  Well, you know, let me go on with what we were already talking about.
[01:25:26.117 --> 01:25:31.879]  People will write me and call and say, where can I get information on this subject or that subject?
[01:25:32.498 --> 01:25:51.782]  When it's sitting right there on my website, sitting right there on the subject that they're looking for, I go into in detail and one of the research boxes or on links or the e-books that are on my website because I don't put things... But most people are babies now, they want to be spoon-fed things.
[01:25:51.782 --> 01:25:58.143]  I know, I know, and it's just very, very depressing to me because there's so many people out there that need to
[01:25:59.236 --> 01:26:02.799]  Educate themselves, and I have to stop and go back.
[01:26:02.799 --> 01:26:10.206]  You know, how many phone calls and emails I get from people who... I ask them, I say, well, did you go on my website?
[01:26:10.206 --> 01:26:11.968]  They say, yes.
[01:26:11.968 --> 01:26:15.331]  And I say, well, did you see the stuff on the links?
[01:26:15.331 --> 01:26:17.973]  And they said, no, we didn't see any links.
[01:26:17.973 --> 01:26:23.378]  Well, did you go to the research boxes, all the boxes on research, all the different subjects?
[01:26:24.191 --> 01:26:25.332]  No, we didn't see that.
[01:26:25.332 --> 01:26:31.817]  I said, well, did you go to the pictures or the audio video page?
[01:26:31.817 --> 01:26:33.838]  No, we didn't see any audio video.
[01:26:33.838 --> 01:26:39.342]  So then I usually end up asking, well, tell you what, why don't you tell me what you did see?
[01:26:39.342 --> 01:26:42.624]  Because you obviously haven't looked at anything.
[01:26:42.624 --> 01:26:44.485]  You haven't seen anything on my website.
[01:26:44.485 --> 01:26:50.149]  You just see the homepage and then you call and ask me questions, which are sitting right there on my website.
[01:26:50.149 --> 01:26:52.431]  Well, Jordan, I mean, people just want to talk to you.
[01:26:53.007 --> 01:26:54.168]  I know, that's what it is.
[01:26:54.168 --> 01:27:02.411]  They want to be able to say they talked to Jordan, but I'm 67 years old and very sick, and I don't have time to sit and talk to one person at a time.
[01:27:02.411 --> 01:27:04.712]  There's six billion on the Earth.
[01:27:04.712 --> 01:27:15.577]  I'd like for people to go to my website and go through all of it, all of the boxes of materials and all of the, like, words to research.
[01:27:15.577 --> 01:27:19.259]  I got tons of words on there that are very important.
[01:27:19.259 --> 01:27:22.280]  I don't put stuff on my website just to fill out space.
[01:27:22.887 --> 01:27:29.172]  I'll put it on there because it's part of my personal research and things which I consider to be very important.
[01:27:29.172 --> 01:27:38.258]  So I'll put it on my website, and then I have to sit and talk with people, explain to them, well, go on my website and hit this button, and what button?
[01:27:38.258 --> 01:27:46.945]  That button there that says Research, and then I have to sit there for five minutes and wait for them to figure out what the word Research means, and then they can go on.
[01:27:46.945 --> 01:27:51.228]  So I will spend hours on the phone with somebody from the middle of nowhere,
[01:27:51.917 --> 01:27:56.560]  Trying to show them how to do research, how to read, and how to think.
[01:27:56.560 --> 01:27:59.002]  It's just incredible.
[01:27:59.002 --> 01:28:05.866]  Well, the architects have done a great job at teaching people how to not think, but at least they're groping in the dark, starting to try to learn.
[01:28:05.866 --> 01:28:06.627]  Well, I know.
[01:28:06.627 --> 01:28:10.049]  I know, but it's very difficult for someone who's old and sick and tired.
[01:28:10.689 --> 01:28:16.111]  I've been doing it for 48 years, and I'm just one person at a time, one person at a time.
[01:28:16.111 --> 01:28:20.893]  No, I understand that, Jordan, but the good news is people are starting to question more than they ever have.
[01:28:20.893 --> 01:28:21.794]  But it is frustrating.
[01:28:21.794 --> 01:28:32.879]  I'll have articles, mainstream stories about camps for the American people, and the government saying they're going to put us in them, and the government saying they're poisoning us, and people just say, I choose not to believe that.
[01:28:32.879 --> 01:28:33.539]  Oh, okay.
[01:28:33.539 --> 01:28:37.961]  You know, like, choosing to say it doesn't exist makes it so.
[01:28:37.961 --> 01:28:38.381]  Oh, okay.
[01:28:39.531 --> 01:28:42.634]  And I, you know, I'm just amazed.
[01:28:42.634 --> 01:28:46.057]  Did the Jews do that in 1940 Berlin?
[01:28:46.057 --> 01:28:47.759]  No, you don't have a choice now.
[01:28:47.759 --> 01:28:49.681]  It's in your face.
[01:28:49.681 --> 01:28:52.023]  So I know, it's just incredible.
[01:28:52.023 --> 01:28:59.810]  And so I just do the best I can and have to live with the threats and the disappointment and all the rest of it.
[01:28:59.810 --> 01:29:00.951]  I just do the best I can.
[01:29:02.472 --> 01:29:10.475]  Anyway, I just also want to make sure that everyone knows there's a lot of my material out there on the web and out there for free.
[01:29:10.475 --> 01:29:12.335]  I didn't put anything on the web.
[01:29:12.335 --> 01:29:14.256]  I've never put anything on the web, ever.
[01:29:14.256 --> 01:29:19.857]  But there's a lot of stuff out there that's under a new title, under different titles that I don't know anything about.
[01:29:19.857 --> 01:29:22.638]  People are using my stuff with different titles.
[01:29:22.638 --> 01:29:25.799]  So, that's the name of that tune.
[01:29:25.799 --> 01:29:30.921]  Alright, well we'll come back and get into the nature of the New World Order on the other side with Jordan Maxwell.
[01:29:30.921 --> 01:29:31.341]  Stay with us.
[01:29:41.212 --> 01:29:45.138]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.
[01:29:45.138 --> 01:29:47.822]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:29:51.388 --> 01:30:04.530]  Now, from the makers of Loose Change, the most downloaded film in internet history, comes the long-awaited release of Loose Change Final Cut, an entirely new two-hour film that completely destroys the official fable forever.
[01:30:04.530 --> 01:30:15.592]  Loose Change Final Cut hopes to be a catalyst for a new independent investigation in which family members receive answers to their questions and the true perpetrators of this horrendous crime are brought to justice.
[01:30:15.592 --> 01:30:17.933]  Loose Change Final Cut is the ultimate 9-11 expose.
[01:30:18.993 --> 01:30:20.754]  From hijackers being trained at U.S.
[01:30:20.754 --> 01:30:26.896]  military bases to bombs in the buildings, Loose Change Final Cut is the one 9-11 film everyone must see.

[01:31:56.587 --> 01:31:59.890]  Tonight, I have a date with a very lovely Rachel.
[01:31:59.890 --> 01:32:06.336]  And today, I gave a killer presentation in Sydney, finalized a contract in London, and demoed our new product in Boston.
[01:32:06.756 --> 01:32:09.379]  Online, from my desk, with Webex.
[01:32:09.379 --> 01:32:12.663]  Webex lets me take meetings and give presentations from my desk.
[01:32:12.663 --> 01:32:17.448]  I just talk to clients on the phone and they watch what's happening on my desktop from their desktop.
[01:32:17.448 --> 01:32:21.093]  So I can travel the world and still be here for my date tonight with Rachel.

[01:33:37.165 --> 01:33:46.608]  Is the best of the free life behind us now?
[01:33:46.608 --> 01:33:54.430]  And are the good times really over for good?
[01:33:54.430 --> 01:34:01.733]  And are we rolling downhill like a snowball headed for hell?
[01:34:14.724 --> 01:34:24.748]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:34:24.748 --> 01:34:28.010]  Why does CBS have an all-seeing eye?
[01:34:28.010 --> 01:34:30.571]  Why do you see all-seeing eyes all over everything?
[01:34:30.571 --> 01:34:33.913]  Why are there all the occult symbols all over the NASA aircraft?
[01:34:33.913 --> 01:34:34.533]  Spacecraft?
[01:34:35.936 --> 01:34:38.697]  Why does a judge wear black robes?
[01:34:38.697 --> 01:34:41.578]  Why do churches have steeples?
[01:34:41.578 --> 01:34:48.341]  These all have answers, and Jordan Maxwell's a great researcher into all of that.
[01:34:48.341 --> 01:34:55.983]  We'll talk about the esoteric operation, the Matrix-like world that we're living in.
[01:34:55.983 --> 01:34:57.744]  Yeah, that's a good place to start.
[01:34:59.222 --> 01:35:05.186]  Before we get into the courts, there's so many facets to this and the history of this and where all this began.
[01:35:05.186 --> 01:35:17.694]  But Jordan, taking 9-11, all the two towers, the Masonic meaning of that, the date 9-11, people pointed out hundreds of different esoteric things that happened there.
[01:35:17.694 --> 01:35:21.596]  But with so many other historical events, they're going to have the Olympics on 8-8-8 and started at 8-8-8.
[01:35:26.024 --> 01:35:28.666]  You know, Hitler and all the occultism he was into.
[01:35:28.666 --> 01:35:33.829]  The elites are totally into the occult, and they just carry forward all these ancient symbols.
[01:35:33.829 --> 01:35:39.413]  So I think a good place to, you know, throw it at you is 9-11, all the esoterica there.
[01:35:39.413 --> 01:35:46.738]  Well, yeah, the 888 is a numerical equivalent for the Messiah, for Jesus.
[01:35:46.738 --> 01:35:49.580]  The Messianic number is 888.
[01:35:49.580 --> 01:35:53.963]  That has to do with the new order of civilization.
[01:35:56.112 --> 01:36:03.581]  You know, God, there's just so much to talk about in relation to the esoteric and secret symbolism.
[01:36:03.581 --> 01:36:09.348]  I mean, for instance, in the ancient Hebrew and in the ancient Semitic world,
[01:36:10.006 --> 01:36:16.871]  The number 8 was a number for new beginnings, to begin things new, was the number 8.
[01:36:16.871 --> 01:36:29.459]  Of course, if you lay the 8 down on its side, it becomes the symbol for infinity, because 8 is the only number that you can continue to write without lifting your pen from the paper.
[01:36:29.459 --> 01:36:33.102]  8 is a number that goes into infinity.
[01:36:33.102 --> 01:36:34.763]  You never have to lift your
[01:36:35.325 --> 01:36:39.586]  Ten from the paper to write eight, and so lay it down on its side, it becomes infinity.
[01:36:39.586 --> 01:36:41.067]  It's eating itself, too.
[01:36:41.067 --> 01:36:42.147]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:36:42.147 --> 01:36:47.828]  And so, consequently, eight was the number of a new beginnings, or continuing to begin anew.
[01:36:47.828 --> 01:37:00.792]  And, of course, thirteen, the unlucky number of thirteen, the reason why it's unlucky, because it's a divine number, because it has to do with Jesus and his followers, his twelve followers.
[01:37:00.792 --> 01:37:04.913]  So the Master, with his twelve followers, makes thirteen.
[01:37:05.763 --> 01:37:16.186]  And so consequently we have the number 13 being the perfect number in ancient mythology, the perfect number for government.
[01:37:16.186 --> 01:37:17.446]  Thirteen.
[01:37:17.446 --> 01:37:19.227]  Because it's a heavenly number.
[01:37:19.227 --> 01:37:23.928]  Jesus with his twelve making the new government of the world.
[01:37:23.928 --> 01:37:27.649]  And then we see the Knights Templars getting slaughtered on Friday the 13th.
[01:37:27.649 --> 01:37:28.869]  That's exactly right.
[01:37:28.869 --> 01:37:31.310]  And so what I'm saying is that the
[01:37:32.711 --> 01:37:48.341]  The Knights Templars and the Masonic orders realized that they had to, if they were going to do this revolt against the old order in Europe, they wanted it to match the Masonic symbolism of numbers, numerology.
[01:37:48.341 --> 01:37:51.523]  Of course, one of the books in the Bible is called Numbers.
[01:37:52.808 --> 01:38:03.170]  And so they had to have their revolution in 1776, because 1 and 7 is 8, and 7 and 6 is 13.
[01:38:03.170 --> 01:38:04.770]  I'm glad you bring that up.
[01:38:04.770 --> 01:38:13.512]  We have the Illuminati supposedly being founded at Ingolstadt University, 1776, launching its operation to overthrow Europe.
[01:38:13.512 --> 01:38:16.652]  Simultaneously, you have it starting here in the United States.
[01:38:16.652 --> 01:38:21.433]  Was our revolution started by the same people, or did they try to co-opt it?
[01:38:22.416 --> 01:38:40.609]  I think maybe probably a little bit of both, but I'm sure that the American Revolution was well planned in Europe for a long time, because there were secret societies which were anti-against Rome, and of course Rome for 2,300 years has ruled Europe, and for 2,300 years
[01:38:44.533 --> 01:38:52.491]  Europe has ruled the world and so the entire superstructure of what we call the old world civilization was Europe.
[01:38:53.064 --> 01:38:56.965]  Europe ruled the world, and Rome ruled Europe.
[01:38:56.965 --> 01:38:58.146]  And that really is the history.
[01:38:58.146 --> 01:39:02.987]  You have the triple agent British, US, and Illuminati.
[01:39:02.987 --> 01:39:06.548]  Benjamin Franklin going over to France, getting the support.
[01:39:06.548 --> 01:39:14.571]  So in a way, we could say that a branch of the Illuminati really did want liberty, or they wanted to set up their own new tyranny.
[01:39:14.571 --> 01:39:15.211]  Which way was it?
[01:39:15.211 --> 01:39:15.931]  That's right, that's right.
[01:39:15.931 --> 01:39:17.412]  They wanted their own.
[01:39:17.412 --> 01:39:21.233]  And consequently, they did set up an order here
[01:39:21.949 --> 01:39:36.225]  Uh, which was the New Atlantis from which, uh, their writings say that they believed that they were setting up a new, established Atlantis on the Earth that would become a world-dominating power because it was operating on freedom and liberty.
[01:39:36.912 --> 01:39:39.673]  And they knew that that was going to happen.
[01:39:39.673 --> 01:39:42.313]  They already knew what the end result was going to be.
[01:39:42.313 --> 01:39:44.314]  What about the Goddess Columbia?
[01:39:44.314 --> 01:40:03.338]  Yes, well, I was going to say, but at the same time that the illuminated masonic orders that were anti- against the rule of Europe by Rome saw America as a fertile ground for a new revolutionary movement in the world.
[01:40:04.565 --> 01:40:12.748]  At the same time, the Vatican and Rome realized what was going on, so they came around the back door, as they normally do.
[01:40:12.748 --> 01:40:20.491]  They came in the back door through Mexico and began to work on the West Coast with what is called missions.
[01:40:20.491 --> 01:40:28.094]  They have Catholic missions and the Vatican missions, and of course, out here in California, we have nothing but missions everywhere.
[01:40:28.094 --> 01:40:31.396]  Well, the word mission, look it up in our dictionary.
[01:40:31.396 --> 01:40:31.916]  Missionary.
[01:40:32.668 --> 01:40:36.849]  Yeah, it means, it's a military term.
[01:40:36.849 --> 01:40:38.789]  It's a military term, a mission.
[01:40:38.789 --> 01:40:47.951]  So when you go to the Catholic mission in California, word mission is a military term.
[01:40:47.951 --> 01:40:52.452]  And this is exactly what's going on right now with opening the borders to Mexico.
[01:40:52.452 --> 01:41:01.234]  There was a big celebration in Florida sponsored by the Roman Catholic Church, sponsored a big
[01:41:02.006 --> 01:41:16.531]  Uh, operation, uh, big celebration of which Jeb Bush attended and it was sponsored by the Knights of Malta, uh, celebrating the opening of the borders for the, uh, the Mexican borders.
[01:41:16.531 --> 01:41:26.374]  And they've got pictures, they've got pictures of all the cardinals and priests all dancing around, cheering with Mexican flags, waving Mexican flags.
[01:41:26.374 --> 01:41:30.895]  Uh, it's high crimes and treason against the American Republic.
[01:41:32.098 --> 01:41:41.022]  The Republic is being destroyed by European secret societies operating under Rome, and nobody seems to know anything about it.
[01:41:41.022 --> 01:41:42.203]  I totally agree with you.
[01:41:42.203 --> 01:41:47.425]  Now, since you brought up Rome, let's get into that in detail on the Jesuits, because we talk about the founding of this country.
[01:41:48.005 --> 01:42:03.270]  To be clear, the Roman Catholic Church at that time was dominated by the same ministry school, so it's two different sub-cults fighting with each other, a kind of spin-off of the main cult wanting to set up its own new cult, but with some different rules.
[01:42:03.270 --> 01:42:04.371]  A, would you agree with that statement?
[01:42:04.371 --> 01:42:04.571]  And then B...
[01:42:05.754 --> 01:42:06.455]  Yes.
[01:42:06.455 --> 01:42:18.325]  Okay, B, then now, because yes, it's true, the Catholic Church today is bragging about the Laurie Conquista, they're helping push it, help teach it in the schools, they want to bring down the United States.
[01:42:18.325 --> 01:42:22.249]  I'm not bashing Catholic people, again, just like the Protestants are controlled.
[01:42:22.249 --> 01:42:26.913]  The point is, that are you saying there's still a fissure between this group?
[01:42:27.777 --> 01:42:29.017]  Yes, I think so.
[01:42:29.017 --> 01:42:39.860]  Because this always has been, even in the mob, even the mob families back East, there's always been differences of opinion and problems with territorial rights.
[01:42:39.860 --> 01:42:47.362]  And so even in gangs, you know, the Crips and the Bloods, they're always fighting over who's going to eat America up, who's going to have us.
[01:42:47.362 --> 01:42:48.342]  The spoils.
[01:42:48.342 --> 01:42:49.343]  Yeah, spoils.
[01:42:49.343 --> 01:42:50.303]  Americans, you know,
[01:42:51.504 --> 01:42:53.345]  Good people never get organized.
[01:42:53.345 --> 01:42:55.046]  Only criminals get organized.
[01:42:55.046 --> 01:42:56.847]  Criminals are always organized.
[01:42:56.847 --> 01:42:59.028]  That's why they're always superior.
[01:42:59.028 --> 01:43:08.872]  Because they get organized, and they think, and they have intelligence organizations, and they operate in the dark, and they're very, very intelligent.
[01:43:08.872 --> 01:43:09.652]  And they're ruthless.
[01:43:09.652 --> 01:43:10.573]  They're ruthless.
[01:43:10.573 --> 01:43:11.493]  Totally ruthless.
[01:43:12.031 --> 01:43:19.178]  Yeah, and now they've bred us to be a bunch of mindless saps that can't even read and don't think that there's evil, so we're wide open to it.
[01:43:19.178 --> 01:43:20.058]  The devil's greatest trick.
[01:43:20.058 --> 01:43:26.204]  Now, I want to go back, because I want to stay on Rome and all these issues.
[01:43:26.204 --> 01:43:30.128]  Let's expand on that, because I'm glad you brought that up.
[01:43:30.128 --> 01:43:31.048]  Go back over...
[01:43:32.353 --> 01:43:57.321]  The basic cults that took over Christianity, what they did when they set it up, and then from that point out, I want to talk about the different subdivisions from your deep study of what the New World Order is divided into up until the European Union, with Tony Blair converting to Catholicism, because they're saying you've got to be Catholic to be the head of Europe, preparing him for the EU presidency.
[01:43:57.321 --> 01:43:59.482]  Well, that's exactly right.
[01:43:59.482 --> 01:44:01.503]  Look, logic alone would tell you that
[01:44:02.396 --> 01:44:09.280]  What area of the Earth has dominated the globe for over 2,000 years if it's not Europe?
[01:44:09.280 --> 01:44:12.582]  Europe has dominated the entire world.
[01:44:12.582 --> 01:44:17.445]  And who has dominated Europe if it wasn't Rome under the Caesars?
[01:44:17.445 --> 01:44:23.828]  And then during the Middle Ages and the Dark Ages and the Medieval times... And now they have the Swiss as their bank, yeah.
[01:44:23.828 --> 01:44:27.690]  Precisely, that's why the Pope has a Swiss guard.
[01:44:27.690 --> 01:44:28.851]  They're guarding the boss.
[01:44:31.437 --> 01:44:34.219]  That's why you have a Swiss Guard at the Vatican.
[01:44:34.219 --> 01:44:42.865]  I mean, it's an incredible array of darkness and conspiratorial stuff that's been going on.
[01:44:42.865 --> 01:45:00.298]  And, you know, as far as I'm concerned, it's so overwhelming in your face when you actually sit in a library and begin to read history and read the beginnings of these secret societies operating like the Knights of Malta operating in
[01:45:01.283 --> 01:45:04.265]  With total impunity.
[01:45:04.265 --> 01:45:07.766]  They don't have any problem doing anything in this country.
[01:45:07.766 --> 01:45:12.249]  Now we see Rome going after the Jesuits at one point, and the Knights of Malta.
[01:45:12.249 --> 01:45:15.230]  From your study, can you divide up those groups?
[01:45:15.230 --> 01:45:17.491]  Is that one unified group, or what's happening?
[01:45:17.491 --> 01:45:22.974]  As far as I'm concerned, it is all one group, but as I said, in any organized criminal
[01:45:23.659 --> 01:45:28.804]  Uh, enterprise on a worldwide scale that's going to be infighting inside.
[01:45:28.804 --> 01:45:31.046]  I mean, there always has been.
[01:45:31.046 --> 01:45:36.791]  Even in the old Chicago mob, there was always killings on the street between the different factions.
[01:45:36.791 --> 01:45:37.191]  Yeah, the St.
[01:45:37.191 --> 01:45:38.592]  Valentine's Day Massacre.
[01:45:38.592 --> 01:45:39.533]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:45:39.533 --> 01:45:42.796]  And, uh, but it's them feeding on themselves.
[01:45:42.796 --> 01:45:47.400]  They're out there, they fed on each other and killed each other, then they turn on the public.
[01:45:48.371 --> 01:45:56.356]  So, it's a mad rush for control and ownership of the human race, and that's a whole story in itself.
[01:45:56.356 --> 01:46:01.939]  How the human race is lawfully and legally set up to be owned.
[01:46:01.939 --> 01:46:08.643]  How our bodies are actually owned on the stock market, and how... Well, they call it human resources.
[01:46:08.643 --> 01:46:10.184]  That's exactly right.
[01:46:10.184 --> 01:46:14.146]  You don't go to employment office, you go to a human resource.
[01:46:14.761 --> 01:46:17.762]  Just like tin and iron and rubber and oil.
[01:46:17.762 --> 01:46:19.642]  It's a resource.
[01:46:19.642 --> 01:46:26.024]  It seems they have a rule, though, to always tell you what they're doing and give you a chance to fight back against them.
[01:46:26.024 --> 01:46:29.365]  How does that feed into their esoteric rules?
[01:46:29.365 --> 01:46:31.086]  Well, that's true.
[01:46:31.086 --> 01:46:35.567]  There is a lot there that all you need to do is just go to a library and read it.
[01:46:35.567 --> 01:46:37.087]  It's all right there.
[01:46:37.087 --> 01:46:42.589]  You can go on the web and go to, just type in, go to Google and just type in
[01:46:43.709 --> 01:46:46.596]  Uh, commerce game.
[01:46:46.596 --> 01:46:51.989]  And you will, and there's a lot of material on how commerce actually, in fact, works.
[01:46:52.992 --> 01:46:53.892]  And it doesn't work.
[01:46:53.892 --> 01:46:56.093]  Nothing works the way you think it does.
[01:46:56.093 --> 01:47:00.753]  Banks, by law, are not allowed to loan money ever.
[01:47:00.753 --> 01:47:03.674]  That is an absolute law.
[01:47:03.674 --> 01:47:06.454]  Banks cannot ever loan money.
[01:47:06.454 --> 01:47:16.816]  Because, think about it, if you go and put $10,000 into a bank, and then 20 minutes later I walk in and borrow $20,000 to buy a new car, I just took your money to buy my new car.
[01:47:20.552 --> 01:47:22.334]  Suppose I don't pay it back.
[01:47:22.334 --> 01:47:28.322]  Now you are out $20,000 because I spent it on my car that I'm not going to pay for.
[01:47:28.322 --> 01:47:30.866]  So banks cannot loan money.
[01:47:30.866 --> 01:47:32.928]  They have never loaned money.
[01:47:32.928 --> 01:47:35.231]  They loan letters of credit.
[01:47:35.231 --> 01:47:36.373]  Oh, well that's different.
[01:47:37.341 --> 01:47:39.722]  And what is the credit based on?
[01:47:39.722 --> 01:47:46.084]  It is based on you, the slaves, and it's basically an imperial mark saying you've got this credit.
[01:47:46.084 --> 01:47:46.985]  That's right.
[01:47:46.985 --> 01:47:47.505]  Exactly.
[01:47:47.505 --> 01:47:50.726]  So they're not giving you anything.
[01:47:50.726 --> 01:47:57.429]  And once you understand the way a bank works, then you can say, oh, I see how this stuff works.
[01:47:57.429 --> 01:47:59.350]  Now I see.
[01:47:59.350 --> 01:48:02.411]  But most people have no idea in the world why they go to court
[01:48:03.246 --> 01:48:05.768]  You only play basketball and tennis on a court.
[01:48:05.768 --> 01:48:09.451]  Yeah, let's get into the court, because I talked to lawyers and they admit all this.
[01:48:09.451 --> 01:48:11.012]  They pray to the judge.
[01:48:11.012 --> 01:48:14.395]  It's all a Saturn ritual.
[01:48:14.395 --> 01:48:15.636]  And the judges even know this.
[01:48:15.636 --> 01:48:17.037]  This is a temple.
[01:48:17.037 --> 01:48:20.140]  That's why the courthouse in the Supreme Court is a temple.
[01:48:20.140 --> 01:48:22.341]  That's right.
[01:48:22.341 --> 01:48:23.082]  It is.
[01:48:23.082 --> 01:48:24.163]  I mean, they say it is.
[01:48:24.163 --> 01:48:26.745]  I mean, even in their record they talk about it.
[01:48:26.745 --> 01:48:27.265]  You know, there are...
[01:48:29.982 --> 01:48:33.823]  Again, I don't even know where to start because I've been looking at this for 48 years.
[01:48:33.823 --> 01:48:46.389]  I don't even know where to start because there's so much to be said about how people are being manipulated and exploited in their ignorance and have no idea in the world what's going on.
[01:48:46.389 --> 01:48:50.070]  For instance, there's two of everything in our country.
[01:48:50.070 --> 01:48:51.891]  There's not 50 states, there's 100 states in America.
[01:48:51.891 --> 01:48:52.091]  Not 50.
[01:48:56.883 --> 01:49:00.766]  And people talk about the United States as one nation, indivisible.
[01:49:00.766 --> 01:49:04.889]  The United States of America is not one nation.
[01:49:04.889 --> 01:49:07.531]  And it is not indivisible.
[01:49:07.531 --> 01:49:09.973]  Because America is not one nation.
[01:49:09.973 --> 01:49:12.335]  It is 50 different nations.
[01:49:12.335 --> 01:49:16.538]  Each state is a sovereign entity of its own.
[01:49:16.538 --> 01:49:21.262]  And consequently, you can do things in one state that you can't do in another.
[01:49:21.262 --> 01:49:23.984]  So we're not one nation, indivisible.
[01:49:23.984 --> 01:49:24.504]  No.
[01:49:24.504 --> 01:49:25.065]  Not at all.
[01:49:25.782 --> 01:49:29.646]  There are 50 different nations, and each one has their own government.
[01:49:29.646 --> 01:49:34.732]  And then we had the founders doing that, saying that would keep tyranny from overrunning it.
[01:49:34.732 --> 01:49:39.097]  And now here we are, 230-something years later, finally the feds are federalizing everything.
[01:49:39.097 --> 01:49:39.898]  Everything.
[01:49:39.898 --> 01:49:40.739]  Feds have come in.
[01:49:40.739 --> 01:49:45.625]  Now look, the federal government is like if you buy a condo.
[01:49:46.495 --> 01:49:57.003]  In a building, you own your own apartment or condo in the building, but there are other people who own their condos in the building, so you have to live with other people.
[01:49:57.003 --> 01:50:10.953]  So therefore, you get together and you decide who's going to be in charge of taking the trash out for everyone, who's going to be in charge of cleaning the pool for everyone, so everybody chips in a few dollars at each month.
[01:50:10.953 --> 01:50:13.815]  Yeah, the federal government is the homeowning association.
[01:50:13.815 --> 01:50:15.176]  Yes, that's exactly right.
[01:50:16.013 --> 01:50:22.577]  And therefore, but now the people who have been appointed by the uh... They're in your bedroom eating out of your refrigerator.
[01:50:22.577 --> 01:50:23.198]  That's it.
[01:50:23.198 --> 01:50:26.080]  Telling you what you can do, what you can't do.
[01:50:26.080 --> 01:50:29.242]  When in point of fact, we hired them.
[01:50:29.242 --> 01:50:29.662]  Amazing.
[01:50:29.662 --> 01:50:30.282]  Jordan Maxwell.
[01:50:30.282 --> 01:50:33.824]  Let's talk more about the court, the robes, praying to the court.
[01:50:33.824 --> 01:50:35.706]  Roman civil law versus common law.
[01:50:36.440 --> 01:50:41.267]  What we're being converted to, and then the globalist master plan, the mutation of the human population.
[01:50:41.267 --> 01:50:43.210]  JordanMaxwell.com is the website.

[01:50:51.542 --> 01:50:53.522]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[01:50:53.522 --> 01:51:00.484]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you, but the symptoms are there.
[01:51:00.484 --> 01:51:08.886]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[01:51:08.886 --> 01:51:14.607]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[01:51:15.007 --> 01:51:16.628]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[01:51:16.628 --> 01:51:18.908]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[01:51:18.908 --> 01:51:23.330]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[01:51:23.330 --> 01:51:25.550]  I recommend Heart and Body Extract to everyone.

[01:51:50.905 --> 01:51:52.887]  Our beloved Republic is on her knees.
[01:51:52.887 --> 01:51:56.490]  The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide.
[01:51:56.490 --> 01:51:58.952]  But in Liberty's darkest hour, there is hope.
[01:51:58.952 --> 01:52:01.995]  The first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[01:52:01.995 --> 01:52:07.719]  It is essential that Patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding of the New World Order Master Plan.
[01:52:07.719 --> 01:52:11.643]  We have a short time frame to fully awaken and energize the people to meet this threat.

[01:52:53.892 --> 01:53:03.920]  Last month, Ready Reserve Foods stated that by fall, food would be in short supply and the government would be forced to impose controls on food and food distribution because of civil unrest and panic.
[01:53:04.881 --> 01:53:09.065]  Well, the floods in the heartland of America have all but assured this will happen.
[01:53:09.065 --> 01:53:15.893]  It is estimated that 5 million acres of farmland will not be producing over 700 million bushels of corn alone.

[01:54:39.050 --> 01:54:50.873]  The secret brotherhood that wages war against freedom controls every major organization, every ancient organization.
[01:54:50.873 --> 01:54:56.875]  Their gang symbols are all around us, from Starbucks coffee to the bikers wearing the Iron Cross.
[01:54:59.332 --> 01:55:01.693]  Symbols mean something.
[01:55:01.693 --> 01:55:05.494]  The Illuminati, they believe that these symbols resonate a power.
[01:55:05.494 --> 01:55:10.156]  They believe they bring in, that it channels in a spiritual force.
[01:55:10.156 --> 01:55:12.457]  And they do have the power, you have to ask, is it real?
[01:55:12.457 --> 01:55:14.398]  Well, regardless, they believe it is.
[01:55:14.398 --> 01:55:18.619]  Jordan Maxwell, one of the foremost experts on this subject, jordanmaxwell.com is our guest.
[01:55:18.619 --> 01:55:20.620]  Into the next hour, great to have him on with us.
[01:55:20.620 --> 01:55:22.300]  I'm on his site.
[01:55:22.300 --> 01:55:26.162]  I'm in a section on religion.
[01:55:27.179 --> 01:55:30.302]  Hidden roots of religion, then we're going to get into words to search.
[01:55:30.302 --> 01:55:33.605]  But I'm looking at the Iron Cross, the Knights Templar.
[01:55:33.605 --> 01:55:41.412]  I'm looking at these symbols also being used in the United States as well.
[01:55:41.412 --> 01:55:43.514]  What does that symbol mean when we see the Iron Cross?
[01:55:44.312 --> 01:55:46.454]  Well, that's interesting.
[01:55:46.454 --> 01:55:55.000]  It's used everywhere, and most people do not realize what the Iron Cross meant, where it comes from.
[01:55:55.000 --> 01:56:09.050]  It's associated with very powerful, dark, secret societies in Europe, especially in Germany, and how the Vatican bestows, when the Vatican bestows some kind of a
[01:56:12.341 --> 01:56:13.302]  What am I trying to say?
[01:56:13.302 --> 01:56:18.247]  Some kind of an award on politicians, as always, the Iron Cross.
[01:56:18.247 --> 01:56:22.672]  The Iron Cross was used by Nazi Germany, Adolf Hitler.
[01:56:22.672 --> 01:56:34.324]  It's used by the Knights of Malta, a secret society operating within the Vatican, which also gave us the Knights of Malta are responsible for giving to America, the CIA,
[01:56:35.754 --> 01:56:36.334]  See, I
[01:56:53.328 --> 01:56:57.390]  Those secret societies, it's hard to tell, you know, who the bosses are.
[01:56:57.390 --> 01:57:02.031]  That's another problem is that I've always talked about this and always had guests on about it.
[01:57:02.031 --> 01:57:15.817]  And then you've got other nuts out there who just make up wild claims, crazy things, and then when somebody calls you a Jesuit or someone, I'm not even Catholic, then it's kind of hard to cover their research when they believe in flying saucers and
[01:57:16.357 --> 01:57:17.457]  Yeah, I know.
[01:57:17.457 --> 01:57:19.078]  And that the Earth is the center of the universe.
[01:57:19.078 --> 01:57:21.459]  I mean, in there I've got you and countless others on.
[01:57:21.459 --> 01:57:23.660]  They'll still say, I never talked about it, never discussed it.
[01:57:23.660 --> 01:57:27.281]  Doesn't matter how many guests a week I have on on the subject, it'll never end.
[01:57:27.281 --> 01:57:30.863]  Because, but you're a credible researcher because we're covering stuff now.
[01:57:30.863 --> 01:57:35.705]  Now, the Iron Cross is associated with Bacchus, is it not?
[01:57:35.705 --> 01:57:37.686]  And that's the Roman devil?
[01:57:37.686 --> 01:57:41.247]  Well, and it's also associated with the old Sumerian.
[01:57:41.247 --> 01:57:43.788]  The ancient Sumerians used the same symbol.
[01:57:44.643 --> 01:57:54.408]  Uh, if you, if you go on my website, anywhere, anyone listening, just go on my website and you will see at the top of the page a button saying Research.
[01:57:54.408 --> 01:58:01.251]  Or, uh, or there's a box, if you scroll down just a little bit, you'll see a box that says General Research.
[01:58:01.986 --> 01:58:03.167]  That's the same thing.
[01:58:03.167 --> 01:58:10.714]  Go to that, and it will take you to a group of boxes, and each one's filled with all kinds of different kind of research.
[01:58:10.714 --> 01:58:15.398]  And so, the one we're on right now is called Hidden Roots of Religion.
[01:58:15.398 --> 01:58:17.720]  And a lot of people ask me about, well, what about this?
[01:58:17.720 --> 01:58:18.561]  What about that?
[01:58:18.561 --> 01:58:24.126]  But the three books that are on my website, on the homepage, are incredibly important.
[01:58:24.126 --> 01:58:24.946]  Tell you what, stay there.
[01:58:24.946 --> 01:58:25.307]  Stay there.
[01:58:25.307 --> 01:58:25.827]  We gotta break.
[01:58:25.827 --> 01:58:28.510]  We're gonna come back and talk about Bacchus and a lot more.
[01:58:28.510 --> 01:58:28.850]  Stay with us.

[01:58:41.588 --> 01:58:43.008]  It is a big idea.
[01:58:43.008 --> 01:58:45.829]  A new world order.
[01:58:45.829 --> 01:58:50.130]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[01:58:54.087 --> 01:58:59.534]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[01:58:59.534 --> 01:59:06.845]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[01:59:09.875 --> 01:59:15.319]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.

[01:59:19.181 --> 01:59:21.743]  Build-a-Bear is making great progress toward a world government.
[01:59:21.743 --> 01:59:22.904]  Most people have no idea.
[01:59:22.904 --> 01:59:23.704]  They're not after money.
[01:59:23.704 --> 01:59:24.985]  They have all the money they need.
[01:59:24.985 --> 01:59:25.966]  They're after power.
[01:59:25.966 --> 01:59:27.107]  That's their aphrodisiac.

[01:59:38.634 --> 01:59:39.755]  You have been warned.
[01:59:43.863 --> 01:59:49.033]  Waging war on corruption Alex Jones on the GCM radio network
[01:59:54.767 --> 01:59:57.668]  ...media, government cover-ups.
[01:59:57.668 --> 01:59:59.269]  You want answers?
[01:59:59.269 --> 02:00:00.149]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:00.149 --> 02:00:05.012]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:05.012 --> 02:00:14.676]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:14.676 --> 02:00:20.939]  Underneath the Iron Cross on the swastika, on Jordan Maxwell's website, he has Bacchus, is not prejudice.
[02:00:20.939 --> 02:00:22.580]  He hangs out at synagogues, too.
[02:00:22.580 --> 02:00:23.280]  That's the horned
[02:00:24.978 --> 02:00:27.160]  Devil.
[02:00:27.160 --> 02:00:33.125]  And then he's got Bacchus's at home here on the monument in TBN's courtyard.
[02:00:33.125 --> 02:00:38.349]  And then you've got Bacchus all over different monuments all over the world.
[02:00:38.349 --> 02:00:44.234]  I saw Bacchus's all over every major government building, the Supreme Court, you name it.
[02:00:44.234 --> 02:00:45.655]  And it's all done as guardians.
[02:00:45.655 --> 02:00:48.097]  They're always at the corners of the buildings.
[02:00:48.097 --> 02:00:51.760]  Continue, why do you have Bacchus on this page about the Nazis, Jordan?
[02:00:53.580 --> 02:01:03.347]  Well, it's not connected to the Nazis as such, it's just one of each article, and I put three or four articles per page, sometimes I only put two, depending on how long they are.
[02:01:03.347 --> 02:01:07.169]  Well, I know the Nazi Germans did put Bacchus on a lot of stuff.
[02:01:07.169 --> 02:01:10.131]  Oh yeah, of course they did.
[02:01:10.131 --> 02:01:11.032]  Is he a friendly guy?
[02:01:11.032 --> 02:01:12.933]  Why do they like him so much?
[02:01:12.933 --> 02:01:18.077]  Well, Bacchus has been, he's the god of wine and drinking alcohol and
[02:01:18.860 --> 02:01:22.781]  And Mary Making and all kinds of interesting stuff.
[02:01:22.781 --> 02:01:29.883]  You can go back to any good reference book and just... As a matter of fact, I think I've got footnotes, and that's something I want to tell everybody.
[02:01:29.883 --> 02:01:35.505]  On all the boxes, all the materials and things you're reading, there are almost always footnotes.
[02:01:36.025 --> 02:01:41.409]  Hit the button, says footnote, and we'll take you to reference works on that subject.
[02:01:41.409 --> 02:01:43.270]  You can do research on it yourself.
[02:01:43.270 --> 02:01:44.872]  Well, here's an example.
[02:01:44.872 --> 02:01:47.754]  The Nazis didn't invent wearing the skull and crossbones.
[02:01:47.754 --> 02:01:51.597]  They've done that in the Teutonic Knights for close to a thousand years.
[02:01:51.597 --> 02:01:57.301]  Why do they worship the symbol of the skull and crossbones, normally missing the bottom mandible?
[02:01:57.301 --> 02:02:00.763]  Well, there's all kinds of reasons that have been given.
[02:02:02.259 --> 02:02:15.332]  Sculling Crossbones, as you said, was used by the Knights of the Caribbean, the Knights of Malta, and some of the Masonic orders that were European Roman Masonic orders that we call Pirates of the Caribbean.
[02:02:15.332 --> 02:02:16.814]  That's why the pirates always had the
[02:02:17.443 --> 02:02:17.703]  What is
[02:02:35.021 --> 02:02:48.564]  Or the old Knights Templars, who not only did business all over the world on the oceans, but they even stole from governments and private investors and, you know, different ships.
[02:02:48.564 --> 02:02:55.405]  On the high seas, they would raid these ships, and that makes their caucus even bigger.
[02:02:55.405 --> 02:02:56.745]  You know, they're making a lot of money.
[02:02:56.745 --> 02:02:59.666]  They're doing it with business, or they'll just rob you, one of the two.
[02:03:00.453 --> 02:03:02.434]  And they're still doing that all over the world.
[02:03:02.434 --> 02:03:12.061]  The bankers are still robbing the people, ripping them off, putting it in the banks, and using the same symbols that they've always used, the way they've always done it.
[02:03:12.061 --> 02:03:18.325]  So, you know, the more we change, the more we stay the same.
[02:03:18.325 --> 02:03:23.388]  The same stuff that has been going on for a thousand years is still going on today.
[02:03:23.388 --> 02:03:26.410]  But now they've made it into a real business now.
[02:03:27.239 --> 02:03:44.087]  A lot of the things I talk about, especially in relation to what we're talking about now, the Occult Societies, there's an excellent book, which you cannot find anywhere, since it's no longer printed, it's no longer being sold anywhere, and you can't even find it.
[02:03:44.087 --> 02:03:50.049]  And if you do, it's going to be $500 to $1,000 a copy, but I'll look for it and I can't find it.
[02:03:50.049 --> 02:03:55.412]  I have an e-book, an e-book on my home page, it's called Occult Theocracy.
[02:03:56.348 --> 02:04:05.099]  Which is all of the secret societies, fraternal orders, all the ancient cults of the world, where they came from, what, you know, who started them.
[02:04:05.811 --> 02:04:13.177]  Just general information on all kinds of secret orders and societies and how they're connected behind the scenes.
[02:04:13.177 --> 02:04:28.768]  Well, Jordan, since we're doing radio right now, and I'm sure folks will go and visit all that and they can read along, I want to go from the top of the pyramid from your deep research, who's at the very top, and kind of do a quick tour of the next segment throughout that occult theocracy, okay?
[02:04:30.269 --> 02:04:35.453]  Also, we're going to go ahead for Infowars.com listeners and PrisonPlanet.tv viewers.
[02:04:35.453 --> 02:04:36.794]  We're streaming live video right now.
[02:04:36.794 --> 02:04:39.376]  We're going to be talking to Jordan behind the brakes as well.
[02:04:39.376 --> 02:04:41.597]  It's too important to waste any time.
[02:04:41.597 --> 02:04:42.258]  So here we go.
[02:04:42.258 --> 02:04:43.679]  We'll keep talking to Jordan right now.
[02:04:48.587 --> 02:04:51.428]  Terror Storm, a history of government-sponsored terror.
[02:04:51.428 --> 02:04:52.989]  Loose Change, Final Cut.
[02:04:52.989 --> 02:04:55.149]  Endgame, blueprint for global enslavement.
[02:04:55.149 --> 02:04:57.050]  The True Story of the Bilderberg Group.
[02:04:57.050 --> 02:04:58.531]  The Late Great USA.
[02:04:58.531 --> 02:05:00.311]  America, freedom to fascism.

[02:05:47.774 --> 02:05:52.036]  If your body isn't feeling too well these days, you're gonna start taking this hemp.
[02:05:52.036 --> 02:05:54.297]  I say go to hempusa.org.
[02:05:57.776 --> 02:06:02.257]  You may not like what I'm about to say, but you know I'm gonna say it anyway.
[02:06:02.257 --> 02:06:05.018]  The government doesn't want the best for you.
[02:06:05.018 --> 02:06:07.459]  They keep you down, they keep you blue.
[02:06:07.459 --> 02:06:12.381]  They starve your body for all its nutrients.
[02:06:12.381 --> 02:06:14.841]  They won't let you grow industrial hemp.
[02:06:14.841 --> 02:06:20.183]  It really doesn't make any kind of sense when it's so healthy for the world and useful for you, my friends.
[02:06:22.119 --> 02:06:26.703]  I hope Mr. Bush will hear this song, for the heart of America wants this one.
[02:06:26.703 --> 02:06:31.526]  Go to hempusa.org.
[02:06:31.526 --> 02:06:36.490]  If you're a truther, an anarchist, a renegade, you only want things that God has made.
[02:06:36.490 --> 02:06:40.974]  Go to hempusa.org.
[02:06:40.974 --> 02:06:43.215]  We offer free shipping anywhere in the states.
[02:06:43.215 --> 02:06:45.377]  Go to hempusa.org.
[02:06:47.827 --> 02:06:54.834]  Hi neighbor, no matter when the time comes to survive on our food supply, every single one of us who have prepared will have two regrets.
[02:06:54.834 --> 02:07:01.340]  Even those who haven't wasted a single penny on Christmas, birthdays, and vacations in order to store all the food possible.
[02:07:01.340 --> 02:07:05.244]  Even those who have sold stuff and taken on part-time jobs to buy food.
[02:07:05.244 --> 02:07:08.468]  Even those who have traded their gold while it will still buy food.
[02:07:09.128 --> 02:07:13.089]  Yes, we will have been called stupid, crazy and foolish.
[02:07:13.089 --> 02:07:18.310]  When folks won't be able to afford food and there won't be any food for any amount of money.
[02:07:18.310 --> 02:07:20.951]  We will still have two regrets.
[02:07:20.951 --> 02:07:24.972]  We will regret that we didn't get more serious about more food sooner.
[02:07:24.972 --> 02:07:28.633]  We will deeply regret that we didn't get enough food.
[02:07:28.633 --> 02:07:35.455]  Putting off emergency food preparations to celebrate the holidays will be the most dangerous decision that some of us will ever make.
[02:07:36.275 --> 02:07:36.536]  Call 800-409-5633.
[02:07:36.536 --> 02:07:37.677]  On the web, efoodsdirect.com.
[02:07:37.677 --> 02:07:37.877]  800-409-5633.
[02:07:37.877 --> 02:07:40.961]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:07:56.261 --> 02:08:11.307]  Well, I'm going to try to keep Jordan five minutes to the next hour, but then we have state rep Charles Key exposing Oklahoma City as an inside job, the bombing, and then they passed a resolution to fight the new world order at the state level, to basically pull out of the union if the new world order continues to expand.
[02:08:11.307 --> 02:08:13.788]  That is coming up in about an hour.
[02:08:13.788 --> 02:08:16.810]  Man, time has really flown by with Jordan Maxwell.
[02:08:19.608 --> 02:08:25.130]  Jordan, again as a permanent researcher, into the core documents of the elite and what makes them tick.
[02:08:25.130 --> 02:08:33.152]  Jordan, give us a tour of the basic history of where all this really starts, as best you can tell.
[02:08:33.152 --> 02:08:35.113]  Have they been passing on knowledge?
[02:08:35.113 --> 02:08:39.494]  Do they claim they have the secrets of the pyramids and Atlantis and all this?
[02:08:40.474 --> 02:08:43.075]  Or is that a fable?
[02:08:43.075 --> 02:08:46.196]  How much power do they really have?
[02:08:46.196 --> 02:08:55.120]  You know, you talk about how their main goal, and now they admit this, is to create two species of humanoid, dumb us down, exterminate most of us.
[02:08:55.120 --> 02:08:59.642]  And I'm just throwing out, you know, the basics here, because broad strokes here in the time we have.
[02:08:59.642 --> 02:08:59.902]  And then,
[02:09:00.562 --> 02:09:05.403]  For the behind-the-scenes viewers at PrisonPlanet.tv, I want to continue that discussion afterwards.
[02:09:05.403 --> 02:09:09.244]  After you finish that with, you believe the Roman Catholic Church is at the very top.
[02:09:09.244 --> 02:09:24.647]  I didn't mean the Roman Catholic adherence to the people, but you know, that system dominating Europe and that it's at war with the Knights Templars who went to Germany, who went from there into Scotland and then into the United States.
[02:09:25.267 --> 02:09:29.689]  Are those two, the Anglo-American establishment, really waging war with Europe?
[02:09:29.689 --> 02:09:34.050]  Or why on the surface does it look like they're all working together?
[02:09:34.050 --> 02:09:36.271]  Or is that what the New World Order is?
[02:09:36.271 --> 02:09:44.473]  Was the Knights Templars claiming they were going to build a new order, but now it's really just a new order that's run by the Vatican?
[02:09:44.473 --> 02:09:46.114]  Again, this is where all the evidence points.
[02:09:46.114 --> 02:09:47.274]  That's why we're here discussing it.
[02:09:48.554 --> 02:09:58.720]  It doesn't matter if it's TBN with all their weird statues or Protestants, Catholics, it's all run by the New World Order, but Jordan was saying there could be some splits there, so I want to walk through that with his expertise.
[02:09:58.720 --> 02:10:01.481]  But Jordan, that's a long-winded question there.
[02:10:01.481 --> 02:10:04.883]  Try to tackle that, you know, scanning the pyramid.
[02:10:04.883 --> 02:10:11.727]  I mean, let's say you had ten minutes to talk to the world about the structure of it, who they are, why it's important to know.
[02:10:11.727 --> 02:10:12.968]  Tell us.
[02:10:12.968 --> 02:10:15.309]  Well, I think that it's all one
[02:10:16.064 --> 02:10:17.045]  Ball of wax.
[02:10:17.045 --> 02:10:28.031]  It's all one operation that goes back thousands of years into the ancient past, a religio-political establishment on the earth.
[02:10:28.031 --> 02:10:41.478]  In the ancient prehistoric world, the kings were always not only head of government and law, but they also represented the connection between mankind, their followers, and God.
[02:10:42.188 --> 02:10:55.112]  So, consequently, they held absolute sovereign power, and I have always understood that kingships and princes is nothing more than the crypts and the bloods.
[02:10:55.112 --> 02:11:03.215]  People who have taken for themselves the idea that they are royalty.
[02:11:03.215 --> 02:11:05.596]  You've got to be out of your mind.
[02:11:06.400 --> 02:11:09.381]  Not to question who said that you are royal.
[02:11:09.381 --> 02:11:17.725]  I mean, in America, nobody likes to be around somebody who is pompous and arrogant and better than anybody else.
[02:11:17.725 --> 02:11:30.211]  Nobody likes to be around those people because everybody realizes, oh, people live in a dream world who treat you and mistreat you and look down on you and snob you.
[02:11:30.211 --> 02:11:33.432]  People know that that's just a fake
[02:11:34.088 --> 02:11:37.150]  And that they're no better than anybody else.
[02:11:37.150 --> 02:11:40.692]  So we naturally feel that about people who are snobs.
[02:11:40.692 --> 02:11:46.114]  However, if it's the Holy Father or the Queen Mum, now that's different.
[02:11:46.114 --> 02:11:55.039]  We will get on our knees and shake and slobber on ourselves because we are... be able to see the Holy Father.
[02:11:55.039 --> 02:11:58.461]  Or we'll be able to see Queen Mum or Prince Charles.
[02:11:58.461 --> 02:12:02.263]  We'll struggle and pay whatever we have to to get in line
[02:12:02.754 --> 02:12:14.438]  To see Prince Charles drive by, when in point of fact, the British royalty, Vatican royalty, royalty all over Europe, is nothing but the crypts and the bloods.
[02:12:14.438 --> 02:12:15.259]  Gangs.
[02:12:15.259 --> 02:12:22.882]  Gangs who have murdered and killed and destroyed the freedom of peoples all over the Earth.
[02:12:22.882 --> 02:12:25.082]  And today, they are in power.
[02:12:25.082 --> 02:12:25.943]  They're ruthless.
[02:12:25.943 --> 02:12:26.723]  They're murderous.
[02:12:27.643 --> 02:12:34.504]  They are nothing more than gang wars, secret societies, criminal cults, criminal operations.
[02:12:34.504 --> 02:12:35.745]  Wow, you just made a point.
[02:12:35.745 --> 02:12:41.726]  Whenever I see the low-level Crips and Bloods and the Vatos, they're all calling themselves Latin Kings.
[02:12:41.726 --> 02:12:43.486]  Their symbols are little crowns.
[02:12:43.486 --> 02:12:45.786]  They have secret handshakes and signs.
[02:12:45.786 --> 02:12:47.747]  And that really is just it.
[02:12:47.747 --> 02:12:48.367]  That's it.
[02:12:48.367 --> 02:12:49.707]  That's the name of the tune.
[02:12:49.707 --> 02:12:54.388]  Royalty and holy people at the top, the priests and the holy ones of
[02:12:55.052 --> 02:13:09.243]  And all the different religions, from the Billy Grahams to the papacy to all the silly nonsense that's on Christian television with all the preachers who are making 10, 15 million dollars with their huge, enormous churches.
[02:13:09.243 --> 02:13:13.026]  It's nothing more than a con job.
[02:13:13.026 --> 02:13:14.607]  It's a con job.
[02:13:15.336 --> 02:13:21.802]  And people are extraordinarily interested in being lied to, deceived.
[02:13:21.802 --> 02:13:29.068]  You know, even in the Bible, there's a story about Pontius Pilate bringing Jesus to the crowd with Barabbas.
[02:13:29.068 --> 02:13:35.473]  And on the one hand, he's got Barabbas, which everybody knows is a con artist and a murderer and a thief.
[02:13:35.473 --> 02:13:40.017]  And then on the other side is Jesus, who represents the truth and the light.
[02:13:40.017 --> 02:13:42.159]  And it's a metaphoric story, where
[02:13:43.146 --> 02:14:10.768]  Government says to the people, Pontius Pilate, head of government, says to the people, here is Pontius, here is Barabbas, a murdering, thieving scumbag, and here is Jesus representing the truth and the light, and the scripture says, with one voice, the people cried out, give us Barabbas, which is translated symbolically to mean, when the people of this world are given an opportunity to know the truth,
[02:14:11.340 --> 02:14:18.651]  Or to crawl on their knees before their masters, who are nothing more than liars, murderers, bloodshedding thieves.
[02:14:19.494 --> 02:14:22.956]  People will always support the masters.
[02:14:22.956 --> 02:14:24.477]  They don't want the truth.
[02:14:24.477 --> 02:14:28.560]  That's what I was going to ask, is this morning, it's almost like a spirit.
[02:14:28.560 --> 02:14:30.001]  I got criticized yesterday.
[02:14:30.001 --> 02:14:34.404]  Somebody sent me a YouTube, a young guy saying, Alex used to say there was a new world order.
[02:14:34.404 --> 02:14:35.525]  I choose not to believe it.
[02:14:35.525 --> 02:14:36.846]  I don't want to believe it.
[02:14:36.846 --> 02:14:37.907]  It doesn't exist.
[02:14:37.907 --> 02:14:39.007]  I choose.
[02:14:39.007 --> 02:14:45.772]  I heard all these radio shows with callers out of flipped channels, and I'd come into work, and it was other shows, saying, I don't want to hear bad news anymore.
[02:14:46.581 --> 02:14:52.282]  They don't understand if you face the bad news and deal with it, then you can have a good place to live in and have more liberty.
[02:14:52.282 --> 02:14:58.184]  But when you just deny and want to live in denial and want to lie to yourself, you have a horrible world.
[02:14:58.184 --> 02:14:59.304]  And it's true.
[02:14:59.304 --> 02:15:02.265]  A lot of people, they want to be lied to.
[02:15:02.265 --> 02:15:03.245]  They want to be conned.
[02:15:03.245 --> 02:15:07.026]  They think it's cute and funny and I don't understand it.
[02:15:07.026 --> 02:15:09.587]  Well, I mean, you know, in a country that is
[02:15:10.385 --> 02:15:17.207]  Staggering in their economic, uh, woes and economic, uh, disabilities in this country.
[02:15:17.207 --> 02:15:30.071]  People are crawling on their knees, sleeping in their cars, and yet the alcohol industry, smoking, uh, industry, television, uh, entertainment, movies, are making a bumper crop.
[02:15:30.071 --> 02:15:31.452]  They're making billions.
[02:15:32.199 --> 02:15:32.579]  Why?
[02:15:32.579 --> 02:15:35.962]  Because the people have lost their souls.
[02:15:35.962 --> 02:15:37.824]  They have nothing to live for.
[02:15:37.824 --> 02:15:42.027]  And that was a seduction because it's almost like a joke now.
[02:15:42.027 --> 02:15:46.251]  I talk to people on the street and it's like they're getting more retarded by the week.
[02:15:46.251 --> 02:15:47.352]  Without a doubt.
[02:15:47.352 --> 02:15:47.892]  Absolutely.
[02:15:47.892 --> 02:15:48.893]  What is going on?
[02:15:48.893 --> 02:15:53.277]  It's like a mass mutation is taking place before my eyes.
[02:15:53.277 --> 02:15:54.178]  Absolutely.
[02:15:54.178 --> 02:15:59.162]  I'm telling you and it's frightening because I know what the future is going to be.
[02:15:59.162 --> 02:16:00.483]  I already know what's coming.
[02:16:01.277 --> 02:16:10.147]  There's going to be a time very soon when Americans, generally speaking, and the worst part about it is that the masses will never wake up.
[02:16:10.147 --> 02:16:11.168]  They will just become...
[02:16:13.067 --> 02:16:15.248]  Acclimated to the system.
[02:16:15.248 --> 02:16:20.572]  I mean the new thing said you'll be arrested if you're seen hugging your child or kissing them.
[02:16:20.572 --> 02:16:32.099]  I mean so and the government says we'll be in gray uniforms with shaved heads basically lobotomized and that's who's even allowed to live and I see them phasing that in rather quickly the way it's going.
[02:16:32.099 --> 02:16:38.022]  That's exactly what I'm saying and so I'm frightened because I know what is coming on the earth.
[02:16:38.022 --> 02:16:39.123]  I know the kind of
[02:16:39.683 --> 02:16:40.084]  We're good.
[02:16:56.325 --> 02:17:00.209]  If it's a black robe, they shake in fear.
[02:17:00.209 --> 02:17:03.732]  If it's a black robe for the priest, they shake in fear.
[02:17:03.732 --> 02:17:12.200]  So they've been acclimated and taught to be impressed with movie stars and wealthy people with big money.
[02:17:12.200 --> 02:17:16.183]  But it seems that the elite themselves have gotten more reckless and wild.
[02:17:16.183 --> 02:17:16.864]  Oh, of course.
[02:17:16.864 --> 02:17:21.048]  And the reason why is because they realize the entire human race
[02:17:21.841 --> 02:17:22.722]  Is worthless.
[02:17:22.722 --> 02:17:32.708]  The entire human race is going to buy anything you put out there, and now it's like the criminal element doesn't even know what to do with itself anymore.
[02:17:32.708 --> 02:17:33.549]  It's so easy.
[02:17:33.549 --> 02:17:37.712]  It's so easy to just fool the people because they love it.
[02:17:38.314 --> 02:17:40.074]  Well, I mean, exactly.
[02:17:40.074 --> 02:17:49.677]  That's like the White House publicly says they're running Al-Qaeda and has them attacking Iran, and the media says Iran is Al-Qaeda when they're Shiites, the opposite group.
[02:17:49.677 --> 02:17:59.319]  And then it's just all over the news, Republicans saying we love terror attacks, they sure help us.
[02:17:59.319 --> 02:18:00.759]  I mean, how much more obvious?
[02:18:00.759 --> 02:18:06.701]  And then Gary Hart writes a letter, has it published in the newspaper, saying our government stages attacks
[02:18:07.421 --> 02:18:08.841]  Iran better do what they're told.
[02:18:08.841 --> 02:18:12.442]  I mean, they may come out and say they did it soon.
[02:18:12.442 --> 02:18:13.683]  Well, I know.
[02:18:13.683 --> 02:18:14.543]  But you know what?
[02:18:14.543 --> 02:18:16.043]  Nobody's going to care.
[02:18:16.043 --> 02:18:17.224]  Couldn't care less.
[02:18:17.224 --> 02:18:22.485]  Because it doesn't mean much to anybody anyway.
[02:18:22.485 --> 02:18:33.128]  Even on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno, when he does the Jaywalk, when he walks down the street and talks to people and asks the average American, you know, who won the Second World War.
[02:18:33.128 --> 02:18:34.429]  They don't even know what you're talking about.
[02:18:34.429 --> 02:18:36.029]  They didn't know there was a Second World War.
[02:18:36.992 --> 02:18:46.635]  And, of course, that thing we talked about before, about that young lady, Miss Teen America, that was so appalling to me.
[02:18:46.635 --> 02:18:50.396]  I still wake up sweaty.
[02:18:50.396 --> 02:18:52.476]  But that's how people are.
[02:18:52.476 --> 02:18:58.938]  If you know any history, they look at you like you're weird and people kind of sit back in their chairs and act scared.
[02:18:58.938 --> 02:19:01.839]  I had friends, my personal friends, many years ago,
[02:19:02.858 --> 02:19:07.222]  Uh, that's what they used to say about me, that you're weird.
[02:19:07.222 --> 02:19:14.327]  You study, and one guy told me, he said, you're the only person I know in our circle of friends that you don't fit.
[02:19:14.327 --> 02:19:16.769]  I mean, there's something about you that's just not right.
[02:19:17.492 --> 02:19:17.812]  I think so.
[02:19:34.093 --> 02:19:36.435]  Stay there, stay there, Jordan Maxwell, we're gonna keep talking.
[02:19:48.843 --> 02:19:57.566]  When I learned that the accumulation of acidic waste was the likely cause of my painful joints, lack of energy, and weight gain, I knew I would have to change to a more alkaline diet.
[02:19:57.566 --> 02:19:59.587]  But it just seemed so difficult.
[02:19:59.587 --> 02:20:09.410]  Then a friend suggested I try a Jupiter Water Ionizer from SnyderHealth.com and detox my body even before I changed my diet by drinking alkaline ionized water.
[02:20:09.410 --> 02:20:10.671]  Drinking water?
[02:20:10.671 --> 02:20:12.351]  Now that's something I can handle.
[02:20:12.351 --> 02:20:17.633]  The guys at SnyderHealth took the time to explain all of the different options and help me choose the ionizer that was right for me.
[02:20:18.013 --> 02:20:30.121]  I use my new Jupiter ionizer for everything, for drinking, for cooking, and since I've been drinking the water, I have more energy, my joint pains are gone, and I already lost 7 pounds, and my skin looks great!
[02:20:30.121 --> 02:20:37.146]  Give them a call today at 877-356-2508 to find out which ionizer is right for you.

[02:21:04.179 --> 02:21:17.262]  On June 4th, 1963, an unknown presidential decree, Executive Order 11110, was signed with the authority to strip the Federal Reserve Bank of its power to lend money to the United States government and interest.
[02:21:17.262 --> 02:21:20.603]  With the stroke of a pen, Kennedy would have put the Fed out of business.
[02:21:20.603 --> 02:21:24.083]  The November assassination quieted the production of the new currency.
[02:21:24.083 --> 02:21:27.044]  However, the Executive Order still stands unrepealed.
[02:21:27.324 --> 02:21:30.245]  Midas has the Kennedy vs. Fed document.

[02:23:58.967 --> 02:24:02.289]  I told you that six years ago, now it's mainstream news and they tell you.
[02:24:03.695 --> 02:24:07.158]  Now they take blood without warrants at checkpoints.
[02:24:07.158 --> 02:24:13.423]  And, uh, Jordan was, during the behind-the-scenes Prison Planet on TV discussion, he was bringing up the airports.
[02:24:13.423 --> 02:24:16.705]  This is our slave training, isn't it, Jordan?
[02:24:16.705 --> 02:24:17.606]  No doubt about it.
[02:24:17.606 --> 02:24:22.430]  I mean, anybody that's got more than 500 brain cells going all in the same direction knows that.
[02:24:22.430 --> 02:24:31.637]  It's just, uh, it's outrageous, but... I was just saying that I went to Disney Studios yesterday, and, uh, because I got a letter from
[02:24:32.259 --> 02:24:44.449]  Disney saying that there was a piece of work that I'm doing with Disney and they needed a contract signed and so they said get this back to us immediately because you only have a couple days to get this contract in.
[02:24:44.449 --> 02:24:46.571]  So get it immediately or bring it over.
[02:24:46.571 --> 02:24:51.035]  So I took the contract over in the envelope, sealed it up and drove over there.
[02:24:51.035 --> 02:24:53.997]  And all the security guard had to do was throw it in the mailbox?
[02:24:53.997 --> 02:24:56.339]  Yeah, just throw it in the mailbox and drop it in the mail.
[02:24:56.339 --> 02:24:59.982]  So I said this is just a piece of mail but I wanted to drop it in instead of
[02:25:00.462 --> 02:25:03.223]  Mailing it, because it's time-sensitive.
[02:25:03.223 --> 02:25:05.064]  And he said, oh no, no, we can't do that.
[02:25:05.064 --> 02:25:06.364]  So we have to open it.
[02:25:06.364 --> 02:25:10.386]  We have to open it up and I have to read it to see what's in it first.
[02:25:10.386 --> 02:25:23.130]  Before I can deliver the mail, I have to at Disney, I have to open the mail, and I have to read the contract, and I've got to see exactly who wrote this contract, and who signed it, and what it's all about.
[02:25:23.130 --> 02:25:27.492]  See just no privacy, no nothing, just total control.
[02:25:27.492 --> 02:25:27.832]  Total.
[02:25:28.655 --> 02:25:31.558]  And I said, why don't you just drop it in the mail?
[02:25:31.558 --> 02:25:35.743]  Because if there's anything wrong, the people who it's going to will tell me.
[02:25:35.743 --> 02:25:37.765]  That's not your business to know.
[02:25:37.765 --> 02:25:38.866]  You're just a security.
[02:25:38.866 --> 02:25:39.727]  No, no.
[02:25:39.727 --> 02:25:40.829]  I've got the badge.
[02:25:40.829 --> 02:25:42.070]  I'm in charge.
[02:25:42.070 --> 02:25:44.593]  It's my... I'm the boss because I have the badge.
[02:25:45.160 --> 02:25:58.287]  So I have to open the mail and I have to sit down and take a few minutes and read this contract and see who it's going to and who signed it and before I can drop it in the mail.
[02:25:58.287 --> 02:25:59.388]  No, no.
[02:25:59.388 --> 02:26:02.430]  I have the badge and it's my job and I'm in charge.
[02:26:02.430 --> 02:26:06.492]  Well, it's the same kind of thing at the airports.
[02:26:06.492 --> 02:26:08.873]  That's why I don't fly anymore.
[02:26:08.873 --> 02:26:13.216]  That's why I do not fly anymore because I don't have to take my pants off, my shoes off.
[02:26:13.797 --> 02:26:15.538]  I don't know what else to say.
[02:26:15.538 --> 02:26:17.159]  It's all right there in your face.
[02:26:31.354 --> 02:26:47.626]  If the United States is run by the Knights Templars, or I guess you said it's inseparable, and the Vatican wants to get rid of the borders, why does every city, and I have articles that came out in the news today and yesterday, mainline news, the police do not arrest illegals for drinking and driving, they do not arrest them for anything but felonies.
[02:26:48.647 --> 02:27:04.582]  Uh, and, uh, they are also hiring aggravated felons that are mainly foreigners who join the military, and, and, and, and the illegals are literally above the law, and then even when the police say Mexican troops are kidnapping and killing Americans, the news tells them that can't be true.
[02:27:04.582 --> 02:27:08.726]  I mean, why is Mexico so precious?
[02:27:08.726 --> 02:27:13.551]  Well, because it's a base, first of all, it's a very important base.
[02:27:14.443 --> 02:27:39.450]  for uh... for revolution in the north america it's a very important operating base like the contras have bases in central america like the uh... medellín cartel out there protected bases of operation for drug trafficking well for uh... tyranny and uh... and drug trafficking underworld activities mexico is a hotbed my god anybody who's
[02:27:40.410 --> 02:27:43.532]  More than 10 years old, Ben de Mexico knows that.
[02:27:43.532 --> 02:27:52.036]  Mexico is a hotbed for secret societies, crime, criminal syndicates, drug trafficking.
[02:27:52.036 --> 02:28:02.361]  So you want to make sure that the borders are left open because the bottom line is that Europe has had enough of America freedom.
[02:28:02.361 --> 02:28:07.604]  I mean, that's so obvious to me because I've been looking at it for so many years.
[02:28:08.417 --> 02:28:13.562]  It is obviously... And we're going to be destroyed by hook or by crook?
[02:28:13.562 --> 02:28:14.643]  Absolutely.
[02:28:14.643 --> 02:28:20.009]  Because, you know, that's the only thing Bush ever said that is 100% correct.
[02:28:20.009 --> 02:28:25.875]  He said that our enemies hate us because of our freedom.
[02:28:26.576 --> 02:28:32.679]  The terrorists attacked us because they had our freedom, and then you find out the terrorists is the black ops.
[02:28:32.679 --> 02:28:35.620]  And they did it to get our freedom, and the government's taken all our freedom.
[02:28:35.620 --> 02:28:40.922]  Well, but our enemies, the enemy of the American people, paid us because of our freedom.
[02:28:40.922 --> 02:28:44.504]  And I'm going to tell you something, that is the bottom line.
[02:28:44.504 --> 02:28:55.849]  At the end of the day, that is the only truth there is, is that the enemies of this great republic hate this republic because they cannot have a new world order
[02:28:56.411 --> 02:28:56.571]  And so...
[02:29:09.835 --> 02:29:16.300]  You've got to destroy this nation and the only people, and who is it that, who are the enemies?
[02:29:16.300 --> 02:29:27.147]  It's the Roman system of Europe that has been dominating the Earth for 2,300 years, of which America rose up against.
[02:29:27.147 --> 02:29:28.028]  Jordan, stay there.
[02:29:28.028 --> 02:29:28.848]  Gotta go to break.
[02:29:28.848 --> 02:29:30.589]  We're gonna talk behind the scenes too.
[02:29:30.589 --> 02:29:33.431]  But, uh, very, very interesting, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:29:33.431 --> 02:29:34.032]  We'll be right back.
[02:29:38.959 --> 02:29:42.864]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.
[02:29:42.864 --> 02:29:45.547]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:29:48.496 --> 02:29:50.477]  Our beloved Republic is on her knees.
[02:29:50.477 --> 02:29:54.079]  The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide.
[02:29:54.079 --> 02:29:56.541]  But in Liberty's darkest hour, there is hope.
[02:29:56.541 --> 02:29:59.562]  The first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[02:29:59.562 --> 02:30:05.306]  It is essential that Patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding of the New World Order Master Plan.

[02:31:45.724 --> 02:31:48.446]  The world's best air purifiers.
[02:31:48.446 --> 02:31:50.167]  Attention GCN listeners.
[02:31:50.167 --> 02:31:54.430]  Would you like to watch uncensored, unregulated, even banned TV on your computer?

[02:32:06.298 --> 02:32:07.459]  Here's the story.
[02:32:07.459 --> 02:32:15.603]  New video feed technology lets anyone with a high-speed internet connection gain instant access to an endless list of underground channels from all over the globe.
[02:32:15.603 --> 02:32:16.764]  And here's the best part.
[02:32:16.764 --> 02:32:18.465]  It's 100% legal.

[02:32:34.013 --> 02:32:35.133]  It's that simple.
[02:32:35.133 --> 02:32:38.775]  Just go to www.orderfreetv.com.
[02:32:38.775 --> 02:32:42.076]  That's www.orderfreetv.com.

[02:32:51.229 --> 02:32:57.857]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[02:32:57.857 --> 02:33:03.403]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:33:03.403 --> 02:33:07.808]  In the last month there have been more car bombings, more rocket attacks, more killings.
[02:33:07.808 --> 02:33:10.892]  Mexican troops in uniform came into Phoenix and killed people.
[02:33:12.580 --> 02:33:15.141]  How many miles over the border is that?
[02:33:15.141 --> 02:33:20.242]  And LAPD won't ask about immigrant status, Associated Press, I was mentioning that.
[02:33:20.242 --> 02:33:26.704]  I've got several articles like this in front of me today, that's out of the Associated Press.
[02:33:26.704 --> 02:33:36.807]  And my whole point is, is that the Spanish stations are all got names like the Rebel, the Race, it's all we're going to take over, we're going to get you, we're going to overthrow the U.S.
[02:33:37.935 --> 02:33:43.920]  And the government's saying, oh my gosh, give all your rights up, there's Al-Qaeda everywhere, and there's no real Al-Qaeda, it's Al-Cieda.
[02:33:43.920 --> 02:33:50.344]  But meanwhile, there is a real group with TV companies buying 700 billboards saying, L.A.
[02:33:50.344 --> 02:33:52.666]  belongs to Mexico.
[02:33:52.666 --> 02:33:58.411]  You've got people that are tourists to Mexico get shoved down and robbed, the media covers that up.
[02:33:59.430 --> 02:34:04.494]  Uh, you've got the illegal aliens, and I've been told this, cops called in yesterday and agreed, but I've had it happen right here in Austin.
[02:34:04.494 --> 02:34:07.817]  You can drunk drive, no insurance, no license, above the law.
[02:34:07.817 --> 02:34:15.283]  Citizens, the books are thrown at, and the police are told, do not arrest illegals, and it says right here, they can be under felony charges.
[02:34:15.283 --> 02:34:18.206]  And, uh, they do not bring up if they're illegal or legal or not.
[02:34:18.206 --> 02:34:23.630]  Uh, that is not an issue, so, so, so, for all intents and purposes, the borders are wide open.
[02:34:23.630 --> 02:34:27.994]  That fence they're putting up is to keep Americans in, uh, and, uh,
[02:34:29.124 --> 02:34:41.046]  You know, my whole point is, during the break you were talking about Henry Kissinger's own book, that, you know, Kiss the Boy's Goodbye, and it's a quote he admits, where he said the military are dumb animals to be used by us.
[02:34:41.046 --> 02:34:57.849]  The police are hated by the New World Order and used, the military are hated and used, they call them dumb animals, our future's being destroyed, and I guess Jordan Maxwell, we the people and the establishment, the minions, I guess we're just gonna assist in our own destruction, Jordan.
[02:34:58.715 --> 02:34:59.296]  I guess so.
[02:34:59.296 --> 02:35:02.660]  I guess it's part of who we are as a people.
[02:35:02.660 --> 02:35:04.882]  We have lost our souls.
[02:35:04.882 --> 02:35:06.244]  We have lost our minds.
[02:35:07.074 --> 02:35:11.175]  And we've lost our Republic and now we're just going to lose, period.
[02:35:11.175 --> 02:35:23.459]  And the reason why is because most people, I understand, it bothers me, but I understand why most people do not relate to the stuff that I've been talking about for 45 years.
[02:35:23.459 --> 02:35:30.861]  And I understand why, because most of what I talk about has nothing to do with football, sports, basketball, none of that.
[02:35:31.819 --> 02:35:41.308]  Uh, and it has to do with researching and studying the movements of the bankers, the history of the world, ancient history, and how it impacts modern day world.
[02:35:41.308 --> 02:35:43.791]  But why would people not want to know how the world really works?
[02:35:43.791 --> 02:35:49.356]  This is all... They don't... Nobody doesn't have anything to do with basketball.
[02:35:49.356 --> 02:35:51.158]  So what is the importance of it all?
[02:35:51.158 --> 02:35:55.462]  I mean, we don't ever have something to do with hooters or football.
[02:35:55.462 --> 02:35:56.583]  It might be of importance.
[02:35:57.392 --> 02:36:00.157]  So most people don't give a damn about America.
[02:36:00.157 --> 02:36:00.979]  They don't care about freedom.
[02:36:00.979 --> 02:36:03.944]  Well, they better care that their children are being implanted with cancer.
[02:36:03.944 --> 02:36:09.575]  Well, I know, but look at, like the Bible has Jesus saying, look, by their fruits you shall know them.
[02:36:10.293 --> 02:36:12.555]  We're supposedly a very Christian nation.
[02:36:12.555 --> 02:36:15.216]  We're a very holy and righteous nation.
[02:36:15.216 --> 02:36:17.278]  By their fruits you shall know them.
[02:36:17.278 --> 02:36:20.280]  What is the fruitage of the American civilization today?
[02:36:20.280 --> 02:36:26.664]  50 million abortions, huge buckets of pus, just a mental illness, totally degeneracy.
[02:36:26.664 --> 02:36:28.305]  That's it.
[02:36:28.305 --> 02:36:33.329]  Throw in drive-by shootings, crimes, gang members, rapes.
[02:36:33.329 --> 02:36:34.249]  Incredible.
[02:36:34.249 --> 02:36:35.990]  And law, there is no law.
[02:36:35.990 --> 02:36:36.851]  Law is a mockery.
[02:36:38.225 --> 02:36:41.247]  That's by their fruit, you shall know them.
[02:36:41.247 --> 02:36:43.729]  I'm telling you, it's just an incredible story.
[02:36:43.729 --> 02:36:50.613]  And then here's a great quote by George Bush's mother, the President's mother.
[02:36:50.613 --> 02:36:51.333]  Her beautiful mom.
[02:36:51.333 --> 02:36:51.773]  Barbara.
[02:36:51.773 --> 02:37:00.899]  Yeah, Barbara Bush said when she was asked about all the coffins coming back from the Middle East, all the young men who are dying there.
[02:37:00.899 --> 02:37:02.740]  That was Larry King live, yeah.
[02:37:02.740 --> 02:37:03.640]  Larry King live.
[02:37:03.640 --> 02:37:04.601]  She says, quote,
[02:37:05.188 --> 02:37:08.570]  This is Barbara Bush saying it about American troops.
[02:37:08.570 --> 02:37:12.772]  She said, why should we hear about body bags and death?
[02:37:12.772 --> 02:37:14.553]  It's not relevant.
[02:37:14.553 --> 02:37:17.775]  So why should I waste my beautiful mind on something like that?
[02:37:19.424 --> 02:37:24.749]  I was just amazed that the president's mother would say, who the hell cares about these chumps?
[02:37:24.749 --> 02:37:29.673]  And in that same newscast, exactly in that same newscast, she was kind of having a meltdown.
[02:37:29.673 --> 02:37:33.436]  She said, if you talk bad about my family, I will have you killed.
[02:37:33.436 --> 02:37:34.116]  Yep.
[02:37:34.116 --> 02:37:34.997]  I loved it.
[02:37:34.997 --> 02:37:37.759]  So, I mean, she's really telling us who they are.
[02:37:37.759 --> 02:37:40.481]  It's, you know, you're a bunch of scum troops.
[02:37:40.481 --> 02:37:41.923]  You're going to serve us and love us.
[02:37:41.923 --> 02:37:43.704]  I don't want to hear about your dead bodies.
[02:37:43.704 --> 02:37:46.847]  Shut up, maggot scum, and help me bring down this country!
[02:37:47.487 --> 02:37:49.888]  And they even tell us, you are scum.
[02:37:49.888 --> 02:37:52.390]  Kissinger writes a book and says, I hate you filth.
[02:37:52.390 --> 02:37:54.131]  And they say, yes, yes, I love you.
[02:37:54.131 --> 02:37:55.111]  Call me filth.
[02:37:55.111 --> 02:37:57.012]  I want to attack more countries.
[02:37:57.012 --> 02:37:58.633]  Inject me full of deadly shots.
[02:37:58.633 --> 02:37:59.493]  Let me breathe.
[02:37:59.493 --> 02:38:00.414]  D-U.
[02:38:00.414 --> 02:38:01.394]  I love dying.
[02:38:01.394 --> 02:38:02.135]  Oh, it's so good.
[02:38:02.805 --> 02:38:07.047]  Yeah, and as I said, Henry Kissinger wrote a book called Kiss the Boy's Goodbye.
[02:38:07.047 --> 02:38:09.128]  You could buy it in any good book store.
[02:38:09.128 --> 02:38:19.372]  And he said, quite literally, in a quote, he says in his own book, military men are just dumb, stupid animals to be used as pawns in foreign policy.
[02:38:19.372 --> 02:38:19.792]  Period.
[02:38:20.305 --> 02:38:23.926]  They're just animals, so who the hell cares if they get killed?
[02:38:23.926 --> 02:38:25.226]  My God, who cares?
[02:38:25.226 --> 02:38:29.847]  And the sick thing is, you try to tell one of these average guys that they will laugh right at you.
[02:38:29.847 --> 02:38:30.848]  Well, go read his book.
[02:38:30.848 --> 02:38:31.828]  I didn't write the book.
[02:38:31.828 --> 02:38:33.708]  No, I know, but I mean, that's the incredible part.
[02:38:33.708 --> 02:38:41.450]  You go, your master says you're nothing, and that they're using you, and they'll just smile at you and say, but I've got some pieces of brass on my chest.
[02:38:41.450 --> 02:38:42.470]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:38:42.470 --> 02:38:43.911]  Well, Napoleon talked about that.
[02:38:43.911 --> 02:38:44.711]  He said, man, people
[02:38:45.782 --> 02:38:49.865]  Both step over each other to get killed if you just give them some pieces of metal.
[02:38:49.865 --> 02:38:51.066]  I know.
[02:38:51.066 --> 02:39:01.935]  And then of course, you know, the Leopold Stone, that's also on page one of my box on, let's see, what is it, on questions.
[02:39:01.935 --> 02:39:15.145]  On page one, research, on the bottom, the most holy of all relics in all of England, the most holiest relic in all of England is something called the Leopold Stone.
[02:39:17.357 --> 02:39:24.543]  It's treasured by the royalty as a very important symbol for royalty power in England.
[02:39:24.543 --> 02:39:25.663]  The Leopold Stone.
[02:39:25.663 --> 02:39:34.770]  Go on my website to questions and scroll down on the first page to the bottom and you will see the Leopold Stone.
[02:39:34.770 --> 02:39:37.272]  All it is is a phallic symbol.
[02:39:37.272 --> 02:39:39.074]  Have you seen it yourself yet?
[02:39:39.074 --> 02:39:41.035]  Yes, I've seen it.
[02:39:41.035 --> 02:39:41.496]  I've seen it.
[02:39:43.075 --> 02:39:46.057]  So, they put the stuff in your face.
[02:39:46.057 --> 02:39:47.117]  Phallic symbols.
[02:39:47.117 --> 02:39:50.719]  In fact, we'll put the... We'll put the... I saw it weeks ago.
[02:39:50.719 --> 02:39:52.760]  We'll put the Leopold Stone up on the screen.
[02:39:52.760 --> 02:39:54.481]  Which sub-page is that?
[02:39:54.481 --> 02:40:01.364]  I'm on... It's on page one of questions in the... on the research box called questions.
[02:40:01.364 --> 02:40:02.405]  Page one at the bottom.
[02:40:02.405 --> 02:40:05.886]  Okay, so you click research and then you click on the one that says questions.
[02:40:05.886 --> 02:40:07.067]  Right.
[02:40:07.067 --> 02:40:09.268]  And then you scroll to the bottom of page one.
[02:40:10.177 --> 02:40:15.358]  And you will see the most holy relic in all of England.
[02:40:15.358 --> 02:40:17.078]  It's called the Leopold Stone.
[02:40:17.078 --> 02:40:18.079]  There it is, sitting there.
[02:40:18.079 --> 02:40:18.839]  I'm on research.
[02:40:18.839 --> 02:40:22.060]  I see words to search, pictures, quotes.
[02:40:22.060 --> 02:40:24.060]  No, go to questions.
[02:40:24.060 --> 02:40:25.440]  The box says questions.
[02:40:25.440 --> 02:40:28.081]  Have you ever wondered?
[02:40:28.081 --> 02:40:29.681]  I think it's called, have you ever wondered?
[02:40:29.681 --> 02:40:30.141]  Yeah, there it is.
[02:40:30.141 --> 02:40:30.981]  Have you ever wondered?
[02:40:30.981 --> 02:40:33.662]  Go to page one.
[02:40:33.662 --> 02:40:34.602]  Have you ever wondered?
[02:40:34.602 --> 02:40:37.903]  Then scroll down to the bottom of the page, number four.
[02:40:39.176 --> 02:40:41.138]  And you will see the Leopold Stone.
[02:40:41.138 --> 02:40:50.185]  And then beneath it, of course, is a footnote that you can go on the web and study about the... study the subject of the Leopold Stone for yourself.
[02:40:50.185 --> 02:40:51.226]  Do you see it yet?
[02:40:51.226 --> 02:40:52.467]  Yes, I'm on there.
[02:40:52.467 --> 02:40:53.408]  Yep.
[02:40:53.408 --> 02:40:58.252]  So, that's the most holy relic of British royalty.
[02:40:58.252 --> 02:41:00.814]  And so, I don't know what that tells you.
[02:41:00.814 --> 02:41:02.596]  Tell folks what the dog tags mean.
[02:41:03.553 --> 02:41:15.080]  Yeah, the dog tag, that's what military people and people in law enforcement have an identification thing on a chain around their neck and it's called a dog tag.
[02:41:15.080 --> 02:41:19.883]  And the reason why is because that's exactly what the military is conceived to be.
[02:41:19.883 --> 02:41:21.223]  A bunch of dogs.
[02:41:21.223 --> 02:41:22.944]  I mean, that's what Henry Kissinger said.
[02:41:22.944 --> 02:41:27.927]  I don't know, it's just outrageous to me.
[02:41:27.927 --> 02:41:29.568]  All you gotta do is just read a book.
[02:41:29.568 --> 02:41:32.670]  You know, just go to the library and get a book on any of these subjects.
[02:41:33.260 --> 02:41:35.221]  And like I said, just go on my website.
[02:41:35.221 --> 02:41:37.022]  I've already done all the research for you.
[02:41:37.022 --> 02:41:40.624]  Just go on my website and go to Research Boxes.
[02:41:40.624 --> 02:41:44.747]  And there's all kinds of boxes there on all kinds of subjects.
[02:41:44.747 --> 02:41:49.869]  And go through my website because there's a lot of material on the links.
[02:41:49.869 --> 02:41:54.112]  And, uh, you know, I do it even... there's just so much on my website.
[02:41:54.981 --> 02:41:59.822]  Well, let's go through words of this research, and just spend a minute or so on each one.
[02:41:59.822 --> 02:42:00.822]  The Black Hand.
[02:42:00.822 --> 02:42:02.422]  Tell folks about the Black Hand.
[02:42:02.422 --> 02:42:06.483]  Well, that was a precursor to what we today call Mafia.
[02:42:06.483 --> 02:42:15.625]  La Cosa Nostra, a long time ago in the Middle Ages, what we call today Mafia, La Cosa Nostra, was called Black Hand.
[02:42:15.625 --> 02:42:21.265]  Black, of course, being the planet Saturn, so it was a Saturnian secret society.
[02:42:21.265 --> 02:42:24.166]  The Black Hand later become known as La Cosa Nostra,
[02:42:25.233 --> 02:42:29.536]  It was connected to the Masonic Orders.
[02:42:29.536 --> 02:42:35.139]  And of course Hoover said it didn't exist, kind of like the North American Union doesn't exist.
[02:42:35.139 --> 02:42:37.341]  I mean, this incredible denial.
[02:42:37.341 --> 02:42:43.985]  How do you deal with the denial when all of this is going on around people and they just say it doesn't exist?
[02:42:43.985 --> 02:42:44.525]  I know.
[02:42:44.525 --> 02:42:45.366]  So what can you do?
[02:42:45.366 --> 02:42:47.047]  I mean, what can you say?
[02:42:47.047 --> 02:42:48.828]  All I know is I just put it out there.
[02:42:49.432 --> 02:42:53.693]  And people, like I said, ask me questions that are right here on my website.
[02:42:53.693 --> 02:42:55.894]  No, I know, but we're doing this live on the radio.
[02:42:55.894 --> 02:42:57.274]  British East India Company.
[02:42:57.274 --> 02:42:59.735]  I mean, I know all about them, but tell folks why that's so important.
[02:42:59.735 --> 02:43:02.936]  This is the modern model of the corporate fascism.
[02:43:02.936 --> 02:43:03.476]  That's right.
[02:43:03.476 --> 02:43:06.877]  That's where the United States as a corporation.
[02:43:06.877 --> 02:43:11.238]  There's a world of difference between the United States of America up until 1868.
[02:43:11.238 --> 02:43:13.579]  And after 1868, we have a new operation called United States.
[02:43:18.456 --> 02:43:21.437]  It's not a republic anymore, it's called a public policy.
[02:43:21.437 --> 02:43:39.442]  You know, even the Supreme Court, the head of the Supreme Court, I've got a quote on my website, or I'm going to put it on if I don't have it, where the head of the Supreme Court said that the Constitution of the United States was officially done away with in 1868, officially, by law, in 1868.
[02:43:39.442 --> 02:43:39.582]  Period.
[02:43:44.309 --> 02:43:52.554]  It has not been enforced, it has not been of any value in this country or in this operation of this republic at all, period.
[02:43:52.554 --> 02:44:01.380]  But now that they still kept some of the old conventions, now they're fully doing away with it, even in practice, chattel property.
[02:44:01.380 --> 02:44:03.161]  Yeah, chattel property at you.
[02:44:04.219 --> 02:44:06.800]  Uh, it's movable, it's movable dirt.
[02:44:06.800 --> 02:44:09.261]  It's property, it's like a real estate.
[02:44:09.261 --> 02:44:12.643]  And part of the real estate is you, because you live on the real estate.
[02:44:12.643 --> 02:44:19.085]  So they refer to humans as, uh, chattel property or movable dirt.
[02:44:19.085 --> 02:44:20.686]  Cognitive dissidence.
[02:44:20.686 --> 02:44:27.789]  Yeah, cognitive dissidence is what the whole country, this whole entire republic is filled with cognitive dissidence.
[02:44:27.789 --> 02:44:32.431]  Meaning, uh, if you hear something that you've never heard before,
[02:44:33.215 --> 02:44:41.098]  Or, as in opposition to something you've always believed, your mind cannot be wrapped around that information.
[02:44:41.098 --> 02:44:42.639]  You just don't want to hear it.
[02:44:42.639 --> 02:44:50.002]  You don't want to hear it because it doesn't have anything to do with what you believe, and you have your own truth, and so you don't want to look at the facts.
[02:44:50.002 --> 02:44:52.122]  You can't even deal with it.
[02:44:52.122 --> 02:45:01.046]  So, your brain doesn't... Like the fact that we told everybody there was mercury in there, and the government said there's no mercury in the shots, and now that they've had to admit, okay, it brand-damaged tens of millions, and it is in there.
[02:45:01.559 --> 02:45:04.620]  Yeah, I know.
[02:45:04.620 --> 02:45:06.381]  Like I said, just go on the website.
[02:45:06.381 --> 02:45:15.684]  But the slaves were told that it was not in there, so they will default to the old lie and say, I don't care if the government admits it now, I love it.
[02:45:15.684 --> 02:45:18.205]  Yeah, I know.
[02:45:18.205 --> 02:45:21.866]  Another word in the box of words to research Congress.
[02:45:21.866 --> 02:45:24.087]  We talk about the Congress.
[02:45:24.087 --> 02:45:27.248]  People have no idea in the world what the word Congress really means.
[02:45:27.248 --> 02:45:28.009]  Tell them what it means.
[02:45:29.307 --> 02:45:34.352]  If you go to any good dictionary, Congress is sex.
[02:45:34.352 --> 02:45:37.816]  You have two words, to caress and then Congress.
[02:45:37.816 --> 02:45:42.020]  And you have the upper and lower house with the goddess and the male phallus coming together.
[02:45:42.020 --> 02:45:42.641]  That's right.
[02:45:42.641 --> 02:45:49.387]  The Washington Monument is a male erection and it connects directly to the ovaries or the oval office.
[02:45:52.239 --> 02:45:59.928]  And that's why you have the Congress, because you've got the male phallic Washington Monument connecting to the oval, uh, ovaries, uh, oval office.
[02:45:59.928 --> 02:46:03.832]  Basically, we have a sun god slash sex cult running things.
[02:46:03.832 --> 02:46:04.934]  Well, that's the bottom line.
[02:46:04.934 --> 02:46:05.955]  And they love killing people.
[02:46:07.116 --> 02:46:10.697]  How about the enjoyment of slaughtering?
[02:46:10.697 --> 02:46:14.279]  Like you or I would feel bad murdering masses of people, especially children.
[02:46:14.279 --> 02:46:18.160]  They are very pious and say it's a very beautiful, loving thing.
[02:46:18.160 --> 02:46:21.181]  Well, I mean, that one general said it on my website.
[02:46:21.181 --> 02:46:23.742]  I've got that quote in a box of quotes.
[02:46:23.742 --> 02:46:32.565]  There's a picture of the general in Testify where he said, one of the top generals in the Middle East said, for American generals, said, yeah, it's sometimes fun to kill people.
[02:46:33.484 --> 02:46:34.205]  We kind of like it.
[02:46:34.205 --> 02:46:35.706]  It's kind of fun shooting people.
[02:46:35.706 --> 02:46:38.008]  It's kind of like a game.
[02:46:38.008 --> 02:46:40.490]  See how many you can take down before lunch.
[02:46:40.490 --> 02:46:42.292]  You know, it's kind of fun to kill people.
[02:46:42.292 --> 02:46:44.814]  But then if you were going after his family, you'd take it real serious.
[02:46:44.814 --> 02:46:47.457]  Oh no, that's different because now you are a terrorist.
[02:46:48.740 --> 02:46:54.886]  I mean, I just don't know what to think about the whole world I live in anymore because it has gone crazy.
[02:46:54.886 --> 02:46:56.167]  What was the Inquisition?
[02:46:56.167 --> 02:46:57.809]  I mean, there were so many Inquisitions.
[02:46:57.809 --> 02:47:06.737]  Yeah, there were so many, but basically the Pope today, Ratzinger, was the head, before he became Pope, was the head of
[02:47:07.418 --> 02:47:11.982]  That organization in the Vatican that was, we call, the Inquisition.
[02:47:11.982 --> 02:47:15.745]  Yeah, that upkeeps, quote, the doctrine, that keeps the continuity of the Church together.
[02:47:15.745 --> 02:47:29.436]  Yes, and what it was during the Middle Ages, we call it the Dark Ages, because the human race were going through things which were very dark, and that's why we call it that time as the Dark Ages, because we were in the really
[02:47:30.303 --> 02:47:33.525]  Now, why were they trying to suppress all scientific knowledge?
[02:47:33.525 --> 02:47:35.966]  We knew they'd hoarded it all and knew the truth.
[02:47:35.966 --> 02:47:51.473]  Why did they want to, and now they want to, the Club of Rome, the Bilderberg, they say again, they want 10% of us to be living, basically living on farms, everybody else exterminated, and then they'll be in high-tech citadels, bases separately from us.
[02:47:51.473 --> 02:47:53.474]  Well, I know, but that's exactly right.
[02:47:53.474 --> 02:47:59.317]  But the Inquisition was an extraordinarily important time in human history in Europe.
[02:47:59.918 --> 02:48:11.114]  When anyone who would even act like you're going to, that you are for liberty and justice and freedom, freedom of thought, freedom of religion, freedom to think,
[02:48:11.536 --> 02:48:17.920]  You were hunted down by the Vatican, brought in, and we know the stuff that went on.
[02:48:17.920 --> 02:48:23.142]  The Vatican priests would pour hot lead into children's faces in front of the parents.
[02:48:23.142 --> 02:48:26.504]  They would open the children's mouth and pour hot lead into them.
[02:48:26.504 --> 02:48:28.045]  Now we see that being repeated.
[02:48:28.045 --> 02:48:34.609]  Now, psychologically, they know when they do the White House memos ordering the Joint Chiefs of Staff
[02:48:35.249 --> 02:48:46.373]  To tell them to torture children with pliers, rip their genitals off, and then the public hears that and accepts it, and says, oh yeah, that's Jack Bauer, that's a great journey of evil, isn't it?
[02:48:46.373 --> 02:48:52.756]  If they can get us to accept the most evil thing, torturing children sexually, then they've got us, don't they, Jordan?
[02:48:52.756 --> 02:48:54.416]  They've got the whole human race.
[02:48:54.416 --> 02:48:56.237]  They've got the entire human race.
[02:48:56.237 --> 02:49:03.460]  Go to any good law book, here's one on my... and the words to research, look up the word human being.
[02:49:04.306 --> 02:49:10.829]  A human being, according to this particular law book, says a human being is an animal.
[02:49:10.829 --> 02:49:12.130]  A monster.
[02:49:12.130 --> 02:49:19.334]  Then you look up the word monster, and it will tell you a monster is a human being and has no rights to anything.
[02:49:19.334 --> 02:49:20.374]  It's just an animal.
[02:49:20.374 --> 02:49:22.895]  So it's all a big joke to them that they've changed all the terms.
[02:49:22.895 --> 02:49:24.236]  You don't know what it means.
[02:49:24.236 --> 02:49:26.437]  Office of Controlled Conflict Operations.
[02:49:26.437 --> 02:49:31.740]  Yeah, and when you read Mein Kampf, Adolf Hitler's book, Mein Kampf,
[02:49:32.153 --> 02:49:40.937]  We, we've known for, I mean, I grew up as a kid knowing, uh, I had, uh, New York Times, my, my dad showed it to me many years ago.
[02:49:40.937 --> 02:49:47.160]  The New York Times had a huge article about Mein Kampf was written by a Jesuit priest.
[02:49:47.160 --> 02:49:53.363]  It was written by a Father Stemple, S-T-A-E-M-P-F-L-E.
[02:49:53.363 --> 02:49:57.545]  Go on my website and look up Father Stemple and it will tell you all of it.
[02:49:58.047 --> 02:50:01.468]  Information there about who actually wrote Mein Kampf.
[02:50:01.468 --> 02:50:08.210]  It was a Jesuit priest at the Vatican who wrote Mein Kampf for Adolf Hitler.
[02:50:08.210 --> 02:50:14.211]  And so, you know, I'm just amazed at how much people don't read.
[02:50:14.211 --> 02:50:16.031]  That's what my website is all about.
[02:50:16.031 --> 02:50:21.773]  Just go on my website and wander through all of the boxes, all of the links.
[02:50:22.865 --> 02:50:25.686]  All of the, uh, esoteric research boxes.
[02:50:25.686 --> 02:50:26.986]  A lot of stuff there.
[02:50:26.986 --> 02:50:28.947]  Okay, Jordan, we are going to take calls.
[02:50:28.947 --> 02:50:33.268]  We're not going to, because I want to just spend every minute covering issues with you here.
[02:50:33.268 --> 02:50:34.789]  People want Jordan Maxwell on the show.
[02:50:34.789 --> 02:50:36.149]  You've got him twice in one week.
[02:50:36.149 --> 02:50:37.269]  We appreciate him.
[02:50:37.269 --> 02:50:38.410]  JordanMaxwell.com.
[02:50:38.410 --> 02:50:41.351]  We'll talk behind the scenes from PrisonPlanet.tv viewers right now.
[02:50:41.351 --> 02:50:42.371]  Everybody else will be right back.
[02:50:48.612 --> 02:50:52.434]  Hello, I'm Dr. Leonard Horowitz, author of 15 books on health and natural healing.
[02:50:52.434 --> 02:50:56.555]  Vaccines included, medicines kill more people every year than any illness.
[02:50:56.555 --> 02:51:03.378]  The cost of drug side effects in America is more than $200 billion annually, with a worse toll taken by antibiotics.
[02:51:03.378 --> 02:51:06.259]  But there is a cure for this medical madness that has remained secret.
[02:51:06.659 --> 02:51:16.063]  Oxysilver, developed by NASA scientists to keep astronauts healthy, is an evolutionary new dietary supplement making deadly vaccinations and antibiotics obsolete.
[02:51:16.063 --> 02:51:20.726]  Taking one to two teaspoons daily boosts natural immunity without drug toxicity.
[02:51:20.726 --> 02:51:23.827]  Oxysilver combines oxygen and silver in a new way.
[02:51:23.827 --> 02:51:29.950]  The oxygen becomes a supercharged germ killer freeing your immune system to fight colds, flus, cancers and more.
[02:51:30.290 --> 02:51:36.676]  Build disease defenses naturally, painlessly, powerfully, safely, and inexpensively with OxySilver.

[02:51:39.359 --> 02:51:39.779]  Do it now.
[02:51:39.779 --> 02:51:40.560]  It is a big idea.
[02:51:40.560 --> 02:51:41.301]  A new world order.
[02:51:41.301 --> 02:51:42.122]  In the near future.
[02:51:54.568 --> 02:51:57.710]  The Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[02:51:57.710 --> 02:52:00.552]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[02:52:00.552 --> 02:52:03.334]  Couldn't their objective be world domination?
[02:52:03.334 --> 02:52:06.516]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[02:52:06.516 --> 02:52:13.841]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[02:52:16.857 --> 02:52:22.321]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[02:52:22.321 --> 02:52:26.183]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[02:52:26.183 --> 02:52:28.745]  Bill of Rights is making great progress toward a world government.
[02:52:28.745 --> 02:52:29.926]  Most people have no idea.
[02:52:29.926 --> 02:52:30.686]  They're not after money.
[02:52:30.686 --> 02:52:31.987]  They have all the money they need.
[02:52:31.987 --> 02:52:32.588]  They're after power.
[02:52:32.588 --> 02:52:34.109]  That's what they're after these years.

[02:54:05.805 --> 02:54:10.408]  Everybody knows the war is over.
[02:54:10.408 --> 02:54:13.830]  Everybody knows the good guy's lost.
[02:54:23.315 --> 02:54:28.238]  But now the elite don't even need us to tell their fields to run their machinery with robotics.
[02:54:28.238 --> 02:54:37.264]  As Bill Joy of Sun Microsystems wrote, he went to a meeting with 200 plus elitists, and he was shocked to hear them talking about how we're all going to have to be killed.
[02:54:38.368 --> 02:54:46.252]  And the police officers out there, most of them will aid the system incrementally as the rest of us are euthanized, sterilized, given cancer, die.
[02:54:46.252 --> 02:54:49.353]  They will watch as their sons, daughters, mothers, brothers die.
[02:54:49.353 --> 02:54:53.775]  They themselves will die thanking their lord, thanking their government, thanking their master.
[02:54:53.775 --> 02:54:55.136]  That is the new order slave grid.
[02:54:56.020 --> 02:55:21.992]  At the highest levels of the New World Order, Jordan, I've heard it described as the Great White Brotherhood, the Council of Thirteen, and we know there's less than a hundred really true initiates that have the full picture of their master plan, but as best you can tell, A, who are a few of the top initiates to the most secret elite group, what's the name of that group, and will they be able to carry out their plans?
[02:55:25.218 --> 02:55:36.162]  The only way I can answer that is that first of all, I'm not privy to be on there on the inside to know the top people are, but I've had enough experience when I got married.
[02:55:36.162 --> 02:55:46.265]  You know, the person my wife was working for, I learned a lot because I found out that so many of the people who are
[02:55:46.952 --> 02:55:50.835]  The real movers and shakers who are making things happen.
[02:55:50.835 --> 02:55:53.497]  You will never know their names, ever.
[02:55:53.497 --> 02:55:56.199]  You will never hear their names, ever.
[02:55:56.199 --> 02:56:04.165]  And that all the people that you are hearing, like the Rockefellers and the Rothschilds and all those people, are not the real players.
[02:56:04.165 --> 02:56:09.750]  The real players are so much more powerful and so much more hidden.
[02:56:09.750 --> 02:56:12.051]  You will never know who they really are.
[02:56:12.051 --> 02:56:12.652]  They cannot afford
[02:56:14.313 --> 02:56:17.936]  To have their name or their face ever put out in public.
[02:56:17.936 --> 02:56:20.017]  So, I learned that a long time ago.
[02:56:20.017 --> 02:56:27.062]  Well, you know, as far as dynasties go, I mean, you know, you've got the Saxe-Coburgo, the British.
[02:56:27.062 --> 02:56:31.665]  You've got the Rockefellers, the Rothschilds, certainly set on large piles of the wealth.
[02:56:31.665 --> 02:56:32.706]  Of course, of course they do.
[02:56:32.706 --> 02:56:38.150]  But I mean, you're saying the true, you know, the true technocrats, though, that are really running the ship.
[02:56:38.610 --> 02:56:39.631]  Yep.
[02:56:39.631 --> 02:56:41.872]  Are people you will never know who they are.
[02:56:41.872 --> 02:56:43.353]  You will never see their names.
[02:56:43.353 --> 02:56:46.295]  You will never hear their names spoken, ever.
[02:56:46.295 --> 02:56:50.617]  And those are the people who are really running the planet behind the scenes.
[02:56:50.617 --> 02:56:53.459]  And like a classic example is the Vatican.
[02:56:53.459 --> 02:56:57.582]  But the Vatican isn't the bottom line on this subject.
[02:56:57.582 --> 02:57:00.023]  There are powers behind the Vatican.
[02:57:00.023 --> 02:57:03.745]  There are, just as there was behind the Caesars of Rome.
[02:57:03.745 --> 02:57:06.367]  Caesars of Rome saw themselves as gods.
[02:57:06.880 --> 02:57:11.344]  But in point of fact, they had masters of their own.
[02:57:11.344 --> 02:57:16.608]  Well, you've always got the inner councils and the orders and the bankers for it.
[02:57:16.608 --> 02:57:18.990]  What's the real power behind the Vatican Throne?
[02:57:18.990 --> 02:57:23.574]  Well, that was during the time of the Roman Empire behind the Caesars.
[02:57:24.309 --> 02:57:30.852]  The raw child of the Rockefeller types behind the Caesar of Rome was called the Pisos family.
[02:57:30.852 --> 02:57:35.614]  P-I-C-O-E P-I-C-O-S Pisos family.
[02:57:35.614 --> 02:57:37.014]  So the black nobility of today?
[02:57:37.014 --> 02:57:40.756]  Yeah, the black nobility of the Pisos family.
[02:57:40.756 --> 02:57:45.078]  And the Pisos, the father was Arius Copernicus Pisos.
[02:57:45.078 --> 02:57:51.561]  They were the real manipulators of the Roman Empire along with their family and dynasties.
[02:57:53.129 --> 02:57:58.331]  They were the wise men, the power behind the throne, pouring over the parchments in their citadels.
[02:57:58.331 --> 02:57:59.131]  That's it.
[02:57:59.131 --> 02:58:01.012]  That's exactly right.
[02:58:01.012 --> 02:58:04.273]  And today, that still is today an operation.
[02:58:04.273 --> 02:58:08.455]  Powerful people behind world governments are sitting reading their
[02:58:09.455 --> 02:58:14.156]  Here's an example, so above, so below.
[02:58:14.156 --> 02:58:18.497]  Here's another quick example, final segment with Jordan Maxwell coming up here after a one minute break.
[02:58:18.497 --> 02:58:26.458]  There's a bank that owns a whole bunch of oil wells and gas wells all over Texas, and you never know, it's a tiny little bank and a little guy living in a trailer.
[02:58:26.458 --> 02:58:29.939]  We'll be right back.

[02:59:29.690 --> 02:59:30.751]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:59:52.073 --> 02:59:54.854]  This is the final segment with Jordan Maxwell at jordanmaxwell.com.
[02:59:54.854 --> 02:59:58.656]  A lot of great books and videos available at his website.
[02:59:58.656 --> 03:00:04.359]  Really appreciate him spending the last two hours with us.
[03:00:04.359 --> 03:00:08.421]  Now I was just talking to some family that was doing some business in East Texas.
[03:00:08.421 --> 03:00:14.624]  They were telling me about this bank locally that owns so much of the land, so much of the property, so many of the houses.
[03:00:14.624 --> 03:00:16.905]  And you find out the guy that owns this hundred year old bank
[03:00:18.683 --> 03:00:24.765]  He's in a little bitty house with a trailer behind it, and you never know, you know, the guy's got like two teeth in his head.
[03:00:24.765 --> 03:00:31.648]  There's lots of that, and so that's at the local level, somebody worth, you know, half a billion dollars, conservatively.
[03:00:31.648 --> 03:00:34.749]  You never even know they had any money, there's not any listings of wealthy people.
[03:00:35.269 --> 03:00:36.090]  And it's the same thing.
[03:00:36.090 --> 03:00:38.651]  You hear Bill Gates is the richest with 80 billion bucks.
[03:00:38.651 --> 03:00:39.572]  That's a joke, folks.
[03:00:39.572 --> 03:00:43.675]  You notice he gave most of his money for eugenics, so did Warren Buffett.
[03:00:43.675 --> 03:00:49.599]  Then it turns out IBM set up Microsoft as a front company to get past trust-busting.
[03:00:49.599 --> 03:00:52.541]  You find out that it's set up for eugenics as a family trust.
[03:00:53.081 --> 03:00:55.922]  The father of... I mean, that's their religion, isn't it?
[03:00:55.922 --> 03:00:58.203]  It's killing us and hurting us.
[03:00:58.203 --> 03:00:59.644]  It's a predator's religion.
[03:00:59.644 --> 03:01:02.265]  They revel in hurting us, Jordan Maxwell.
[03:01:02.265 --> 03:01:06.206]  That's right, yeah, and to mutate the human race into a race of animals.
[03:01:06.206 --> 03:01:09.788]  Oh my God, we've watched that on television and movies.
[03:01:09.788 --> 03:01:17.471]  There have been tons of television shows and movies and books written about, you know, the New Order and
[03:01:18.581 --> 03:01:25.767]  You know, Island of Lost Souls, back in 1939, Charles Lawton made a movie called Island of Lost Souls, 1965.
[03:01:25.767 --> 03:01:29.931]  Yeah, that's on the island of Dr. Maru with the Genesis H.G.
[03:01:29.931 --> 03:01:30.531]  Wells.
[03:01:30.531 --> 03:01:33.133]  That's right, and that's precisely the point.
[03:01:33.974 --> 03:01:39.397]  We've been told about this stuff for years in movies and TV about the world that's coming.
[03:01:39.397 --> 03:01:41.098]  Well, it's about ultimate domination.
[03:01:41.098 --> 03:01:44.099]  The greatest control freak doesn't just want your money and control.
[03:01:44.099 --> 03:01:45.100]  They want to hurt you.
[03:01:45.100 --> 03:01:46.361]  They want to kill you.
[03:01:46.361 --> 03:01:50.823]  They want to turn you into a monkey creature and laugh at you because they want to be gods.
[03:01:50.823 --> 03:01:52.524]  I was in a hotel in London.
[03:01:53.444 --> 03:01:56.587]  And these people that, you know, were looking at us disdainfully.
[03:01:56.587 --> 03:01:57.948]  Oh, you're Alex Jones.
[03:01:57.948 --> 03:02:01.571]  And they're like, we're royal and we vacation all year and you're scum.
[03:02:01.571 --> 03:02:04.853]  And whether they were or not, the point is, they wanted me to know that.
[03:02:04.853 --> 03:02:07.395]  They're miserable, unhappy cancers.
[03:02:07.395 --> 03:02:08.536]  Well, you're right.
[03:02:08.536 --> 03:02:09.457]  No doubt about it.
[03:02:09.457 --> 03:02:13.340]  And if anybody... I need to say this again.
[03:02:13.340 --> 03:02:21.366]  If anybody's really interested in the subject of occult and secret societies, there's a reference book on my homepage that's filled with that.
[03:02:22.819 --> 03:02:41.706]  I don't know, 560 pages is a very thick book on all of the secret societies, occult orders of Europe, around the world, religious orders, the different cults of theology, secret societies, criminal societies, it's just generally and incredibly
[03:02:42.196 --> 03:02:49.565]  Well-written book called Occult Theocracy, The World of the Occult Secret Societies.
[03:02:49.565 --> 03:02:57.095]  And the most impressive book I ever have read on theology and religion was called Symbols, Sex, and the Stars.
[03:02:58.001 --> 03:03:04.645]  And it is a very well-written book just explaining theology.
[03:03:04.645 --> 03:03:08.928]  And then again, that term, the stars, the movie stars.
[03:03:08.928 --> 03:03:10.889]  Of course!
[03:03:10.889 --> 03:03:13.571]  Absolutely, and that's where we get it from.
[03:03:13.571 --> 03:03:20.755]  And of course, the other book I have on my homepage is Stellar Theology of Masonic Astronomy.
[03:03:20.755 --> 03:03:23.897]  Incredibly important.
[03:03:23.897 --> 03:03:24.578]  Explaining
[03:03:25.268 --> 03:03:39.039]  How the astrological symbols and terms that are used in secret societies have to have a book called Stellar Theology and Masonic Astronomy.
[03:03:39.039 --> 03:03:41.080]  It's right there on my homepage.
[03:03:41.080 --> 03:03:51.088]  And of course there's a downloadable box just beneath it that has all kinds of documents and materials that you can't find anywhere that I've made available to people.
[03:03:52.567 --> 03:04:06.487]  Well, Jordan, I just want to say in closing, thank you so much for spending time with us again, and coming up not this Sunday, but the Sunday after next, we've got you on the Sunday Show, and I'm glad you've been spending so much time with us, and we'll go through some more of these terms and hopefully get people to
[03:04:07.108 --> 03:04:19.532]  Just to think about looking behind the curtain and realize there is a curtain, we can argue about what's behind it all day, but the important thing is to get people thinking and to move forward, and I really appreciate you spending time with us, Jordan Maxwell.
[03:04:19.532 --> 03:04:21.913]  Well, I thank you for being my friend and letting me on.
[03:04:21.913 --> 03:04:23.293]  Thank you very much for everything.
[03:04:23.293 --> 03:04:23.634]  You bet.
[03:04:23.634 --> 03:04:25.174]  Thank you, Jordan Maxwell.
[03:04:25.174 --> 03:04:27.835]  Yeah, listeners a few months ago were like, is Jordan Maxwell on?
[03:04:27.835 --> 03:04:29.436]  Well, he agreed to come on.
[03:04:29.436 --> 03:04:32.437]  He said he wasn't doing interviews anymore, and we twisted his arm into it.
[03:04:32.437 --> 03:04:33.337]  Two in one week.

[03:07:22.919 --> 03:07:24.799]  Knowing they're all natural and safe.
[03:07:24.799 --> 03:07:26.199]  And I save big time.

[03:07:45.067 --> 03:07:50.471]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[03:07:50.471 --> 03:07:55.934]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[03:07:55.934 --> 03:08:00.758]  Okay, we have State Representative Charles Key on with us.
[03:08:00.758 --> 03:08:06.682]  For the next 55 minutes, he valiantly has exposed the fact that
[03:08:07.870 --> 03:08:11.676]  There's a cover-up of what really happened in the Oklahoma City bombing.
[03:08:11.676 --> 03:08:21.270]  Since he first really pushed with grand jurors and others to expose that, it's come out that the Southern Poverty Law Center was involved in running the white supremacist compound.
[03:08:23.385 --> 03:08:24.726]  At Elohim City.
[03:08:24.726 --> 03:08:26.606]  They gotta get our guns one way or the other, don't they?
[03:08:26.606 --> 03:08:28.987]  These America haters.
[03:08:28.987 --> 03:08:34.710]  And it's also come out in sworn affidavits in major newspapers that McVeigh was a government operative.
[03:08:34.710 --> 03:08:36.890]  We already knew that.
[03:08:36.890 --> 03:08:40.132]  And the fact that the building was blown out, not in.
[03:08:40.132 --> 03:08:41.112]  It's just amazing.
[03:08:41.112 --> 03:08:43.273]  We covered that in my film, Road to Tyranny.
[03:08:43.273 --> 03:08:50.416]  And I want to spend some time at the end of the interview dealing with the new developments there with Representative Keene.
[03:08:50.416 --> 03:08:52.957]  But about a week ago, we learned the good news.
[03:08:57.421 --> 03:09:09.934]  And that dovetails with other states like Arizona, one of the Dakotas, New Hampshire saying that if a new world order continues or gun confiscation begins or any of this happens, we're going to pull out, we're going to secede.
[03:09:09.934 --> 03:09:11.976]  Well, this story was from World Net Daily.
[03:09:11.976 --> 03:09:14.078]  It was also in some of the Oklahoma papers.
[03:09:14.078 --> 03:09:16.441]  Oklahoma defends, don't tread on me.
[03:09:16.441 --> 03:09:18.883]  State House defends its sovereignty from D.C.
[03:09:18.883 --> 03:09:19.444]  intrusion.
[03:09:20.396 --> 03:09:22.977]  This is what we need, a declaration that the Feds are out of control.
[03:09:22.977 --> 03:09:25.699]  I mean, they're federalizing everything with our tax money.
[03:09:25.699 --> 03:09:29.280]  They take our money and send a few cents of it back with controls.
[03:09:29.280 --> 03:09:34.943]  Steamed over a perceived increase in federal usurping of states' rights, Oklahoma House representatives told Washington, D.C.
[03:09:34.943 --> 03:09:36.084]  to back off.
[03:09:36.084 --> 03:09:38.505]  Joint resolution 1089 passed by an overwhelming 92-3 margin.
[03:09:41.914 --> 03:09:44.557]  Reasserts Oklahoma's sovereignty under the Tenth Amendment to the U.S.
[03:09:44.557 --> 03:09:52.147]  Constitution, and according to the resolution's own language, is serving notice to the federal government to cease and desist certain mandates.
[03:09:52.147 --> 03:10:01.038]  The Tenth Amendment states, the powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited to by the states, are reserved to the states, respectively, or to the people.
[03:10:02.119 --> 03:10:12.783]  Charles Key, the Republican State Representative who authored the Resolution, told World and Daily they introduced it because he believes the federal government's overstepping its bounds has put our Constitution in the form of government in danger.
[03:10:12.783 --> 03:10:15.384]  And so he's the guy that got it passed 92 to 3.
[03:10:15.384 --> 03:10:17.405]  I'd like to know who those 3 are.
[03:10:18.647 --> 03:10:29.709]  And, you know, stuff happened with members of the legislature and with the local mayor, where they would say, oh, I don't know anything about a North American union, and then they'd catch them as signatories to it five years ago.
[03:10:29.709 --> 03:10:32.410]  So, a lot of that has got Oklahomans up in arms.
[03:10:32.410 --> 03:10:40.911]  I wish we had people in our legislature like Charles Key here in Texas, where they're really raping the daylights out of us, the feds are.
[03:10:40.911 --> 03:10:43.792]  But, Charles Key, thank you so much for coming on with us.
[03:10:43.792 --> 03:10:45.212]  Hey, it's good to be with you again, Alex.
[03:10:46.546 --> 03:10:48.787]  You know, you've got the floor here for the next 50 minutes.
[03:10:48.787 --> 03:10:54.811]  Tell me about the Oklahoma City bombing website, this website, your site, what you're doing.
[03:10:54.811 --> 03:11:00.113]  But after you do that, let's get into this resolution and why it's a ray of hope.
[03:11:00.113 --> 03:11:07.277]  Well, you know this, and just for some of your listeners to know, I'm in my second tenure in the legislature.
[03:11:07.277 --> 03:11:10.679]  I had a previous life in the 80s and 90s in the legislature.
[03:11:11.520 --> 03:11:18.522]  And I was out for about eight years, and I didn't really plan on running again, but I did in 2006, so here I am.
[03:11:18.522 --> 03:11:26.085]  And the reason you had me on the show today, HGR 1089, which is the 10th Amendment resolution, did pass the House this year.
[03:11:27.086 --> 03:11:28.307]  But it's not brand new.
[03:11:28.307 --> 03:11:33.208]  It's new to a lot of people, but it actually started back in the very early 90s.
[03:11:33.208 --> 03:11:38.150]  There was a state senator from Colorado named Charles Duke, and he started it.
[03:11:38.150 --> 03:11:38.790]  He gets credit.
[03:11:38.790 --> 03:11:49.514]  It was started in the 10th Amendment Resolution, but he and myself back then and a number of other legislators in other state legislatures introduced it in their state legislatures and passed it back then.
[03:11:49.514 --> 03:11:51.175]  I passed it in the Oklahoma House back in 1994.
[03:11:52.595 --> 03:12:02.200]  Yeah, let's be clear, you guys passed that and said the UN's not coming in here, we're not putting up with land grabs, and boom, a little bombing happened to teach you to love the feds.
[03:12:02.200 --> 03:12:09.824]  Interesting times back then, and I'd love to take credit for it this time this year, but you know, it does have a history that goes back into the 90s.
[03:12:10.757 --> 03:12:17.782]  But it's something we definitely, we must get out there and get every state to pass this same resolution.
[03:12:17.782 --> 03:12:24.726]  And I tell you, I've got a lot of legislators that are contacting me and saying they want to do the same thing in their legislature this next year.
[03:12:24.726 --> 03:12:29.209]  I even got some people down there in Texas.
[03:12:29.209 --> 03:12:31.831]  Wow, now I didn't know that.
[03:12:31.831 --> 03:12:34.513]  I don't want to put you on the spot, but do you have in front of you who they are?
[03:12:37.185 --> 03:12:46.371]  Have their approval to talk about it on a public broadcast, so just out of deference to them, I think it'd probably be better if I didn't mention their names, but I guarantee you there's some real interest in the Texas Legislature.
[03:12:46.371 --> 03:12:49.254]  Gotcha, we want to sneak up on them, that makes sense.
[03:12:49.254 --> 03:12:58.140]  Tell folks, I've got it here in front of me, but tell them where they can find the resolution to try to give it to their legislatures, and tell us what's in the resolution, why it's so important.
[03:12:58.140 --> 03:13:03.503]  Well, first of all, they could email me at charles.key at okhouse.gov
[03:13:04.895 --> 03:13:23.542]  And request a copy, I would be glad to send it to them, or they can go to the Oklahoma House of Representatives website that's real easy to find, and it's a very user-friendly website, and just look up HJR1089 and you can download your own copy of it.
[03:13:23.542 --> 03:13:28.924]  Tell us about some of the pun intended key areas of the legislation.
[03:13:29.798 --> 03:13:32.239]  Well, you know, you pretty much described it in the opening.
[03:13:32.239 --> 03:13:41.861]  It just simply reiterates what the Tenth Amendment says and says federal government, get back into your proper role and stop getting into areas that you have no legal authority to be into.
[03:13:41.861 --> 03:13:45.422]  And my gosh, the list, you know, we don't have enough time in an hour.
[03:13:45.422 --> 03:13:51.443]  We'd have to spend all day long talking about what the federal government's done and venturing into areas they have no legal authority to be in.
[03:13:51.443 --> 03:13:54.524]  But go over some of the most egregious and why your state's upset.
[03:13:55.180 --> 03:14:11.054]  Well, you've got the, you know, you've got the violations of privacy, the Fourth Amendment, because of bills like the Patriot Act and all the other ones that we've already forgot the names of them, in which they've tried and they have, I like to say, tried to restrict our rights.
[03:14:11.054 --> 03:14:12.695]  Of course, they have.
[03:14:12.695 --> 03:14:18.760]  But, you know, I happen to be one that I don't believe in saying, well, they got us again.
[03:14:18.760 --> 03:14:20.662]  You know, they've eliminated another amendment.
[03:14:21.802 --> 03:14:25.284]  I think the supreme law of the land is just that.
[03:14:25.284 --> 03:14:26.824]  It's the supreme law of the land.
[03:14:26.824 --> 03:14:27.184]  I agree.
[03:14:27.184 --> 03:14:27.865]  It's still there.
[03:14:27.865 --> 03:14:31.306]  Just because they're criminal doesn't mean I'm still not a free human being.
[03:14:31.306 --> 03:14:34.908]  Yeah, just because they passed some bill doesn't mean all of a sudden they superseded it or something.
[03:14:34.908 --> 03:14:35.608]  They got rid of it.
[03:14:36.371 --> 03:14:43.534]  But, you know, you've got privacy, you've got surveillance, you've got ventures into the area of education.
[03:14:43.534 --> 03:14:53.617]  You know, they're telling people what to do and how to educate their kids from Washington, D.C., tying funds to it to try to, you know... And all the problems started when the feds got involved.
[03:14:53.617 --> 03:14:54.597]  Yeah, it just gets worse.
[03:14:54.597 --> 03:14:57.378]  It doesn't get better.
[03:14:57.378 --> 03:14:58.239]  Hate crimes.
[03:14:59.434 --> 03:15:05.757]  You know, they had a bill this last year that gave a lot of money to hire more law enforcement officers.
[03:15:05.757 --> 03:15:07.758]  They don't have any right to be doing that.
[03:15:07.758 --> 03:15:08.819]  That's not their role.
[03:15:08.819 --> 03:15:11.260]  Their right to be in that particular area.
[03:15:11.260 --> 03:15:17.043]  Well, I hear people all the time on talk radio, even so-called conservatives, say, but it's free money.
[03:15:17.043 --> 03:15:24.387]  No, in fact, from what I've seen, federal money is the most, even if you agree with the programs, which we don't, I mean, it is the most wasteful.
[03:15:24.387 --> 03:15:25.147]  It's our money.
[03:15:26.840 --> 03:15:41.384]  Yeah, you know what, there was an idea that came up back in those early and middle 90s when some of us back then were looking at what we could do to thwart the activity of the federal government in unconstitutional areas.
[03:15:41.384 --> 03:15:51.427]  And this idea came up, if anybody's listening out there that might want to pass this on to a legislator or some of the legislators that are listening to this program, or people running for office, you know, it is our money.
[03:15:52.706 --> 03:15:58.550]  And they're taking it and directing it back to the states with kind of a carrot-stick approach.
[03:15:58.550 --> 03:16:04.533]  You do this, we'll give you this money, then once you get hooked into the deal, then they'll take the money away unless you keep doing it and do more.
[03:16:04.533 --> 03:16:06.194]  Yeah, unfunded mandates.
[03:16:06.194 --> 03:16:19.943]  Yeah, what if the states said, okay, look, we're going to start requiring our people within the state to send certain federal taxes to us through the state treasury, and then we'll pass it on up to the federal government.
[03:16:20.769 --> 03:16:25.870]  And this is a real good money-generating, revenue-generating idea, by the way.
[03:16:25.870 --> 03:16:30.211]  The states would have some short-term interest they'd make on that money as it floated through.
[03:16:30.211 --> 03:16:33.172]  And that might really help some states out.
[03:16:33.172 --> 03:16:46.115]  But it would also allow the states to say to the federal government, when they start pushing more unfunded mandates and unconstitutional acts, to say, well, maybe we won't send that money back up to you, we'll just keep it.
[03:16:46.115 --> 03:16:48.256]  Maybe the states need to start doing something like that.
[03:16:49.167 --> 03:16:52.289]  Because it is our money.
[03:16:52.289 --> 03:16:54.370]  Well, it certainly is.
[03:16:54.370 --> 03:17:02.914]  What are some other areas that you think are important people know about dealing with the declaration?
[03:17:02.914 --> 03:17:18.802]  Well, you know, the big issues out there, well, the big issues that have been talked about for several years, I think it's gotten prominent again this time around because of the Ron Paul campaign, is the money issue, the authority given to the Federal Reserve, Private Federal Reserve Bank,
[03:17:19.409 --> 03:17:24.494]  To have control over just about every aspect of our lives, having to do with finances and money.
[03:17:24.494 --> 03:17:28.878]  That is proving, and finally proving, to be a really big problem.
[03:17:28.878 --> 03:17:30.540]  They don't have the authority to do that.
[03:17:30.540 --> 03:17:32.722]  It's unconstitutional.
[03:17:32.722 --> 03:17:34.123]  And that needs to be addressed.
[03:17:34.123 --> 03:17:40.009]  Well, now they're saying the Federal Reserve's issued so much currency and liquidity that the dollar's gonna be like toilet paper.
[03:17:40.009 --> 03:17:43.553]  Yeah, well, it's, you know, it seems to be heading that way.
[03:17:44.326 --> 03:17:45.386]  It's pretty bad right now.
[03:17:45.386 --> 03:17:55.730]  What amazes me and really makes me mad is a lot of these talking head pundits and people in both parties that make bookus of money and have been living off the system for a long time.
[03:17:55.730 --> 03:18:01.192]  They don't have a clue how tough it is for the average middle and lower income person out here trying to get by.
[03:18:01.192 --> 03:18:07.874]  And they think everybody's still making a couple hundred thousand or more dollars a year and everything's real rosy.
[03:18:07.874 --> 03:18:10.255]  But the country is hurting right now.
[03:18:10.255 --> 03:18:13.676]  And it can get a lot worse than it might, but that needs to be fixed.
[03:18:15.017 --> 03:18:22.740]  The answer is not to print more dollars up and throw a few coins back towards the folks with some type of a tax rebate or something.
[03:18:22.740 --> 03:18:24.120]  But that issue needs to be addressed.
[03:18:24.120 --> 03:18:27.241]  We've also got the problem of just taxation itself.
[03:18:27.241 --> 03:18:30.922]  The federal income tax is a bad tax.
[03:18:30.922 --> 03:18:33.583]  It's not a legal tax.
[03:18:33.583 --> 03:18:39.165]  The Supreme Court, once in our history at least, has ruled that it was not constitutional.
[03:18:39.165 --> 03:18:39.965]  If a court had the
[03:18:42.885 --> 03:18:53.891]  Oh, what, the courage or the will, the constitutional knowledge or whatever is holding them back from ruling on this issue.
[03:18:53.891 --> 03:18:55.632]  Maybe they just need an opportunity.
[03:18:55.632 --> 03:18:58.854]  They ought to rule again that the federal income tax is unconstitutional.
[03:19:01.890 --> 03:19:16.576]  You know, it's just hard to believe that a state would have to pass a resolution saying the state of Oklahoma hereby claims sovereignty under the Tenth Amendment of the Constitution of the United States over all powers not otherwise enumerated and granted to the federal government by the Constitution of the United States.
[03:19:16.576 --> 03:19:26.100]  And you serve notice and demand of the federal government as our agent to cease and desist effective immediately mandates that are beyond the scope of these constitutionally delegated powers.
[03:19:26.100 --> 03:19:28.081]  Like federalizing local police
[03:19:28.801 --> 03:19:30.962]  I mean, folks, the government is out of control.
[03:19:30.962 --> 03:19:34.965]  The federal government, it's like a neighbor who's in your house telling you what to do.
[03:19:34.965 --> 03:19:37.126]  I mean, it is out of control.
[03:19:37.126 --> 03:19:38.307]  We'll be right back with State Rep.
[03:19:38.307 --> 03:19:39.447]  Charles Key, a great guy.
[03:19:39.447 --> 03:19:40.628]  We'll cover some other subjects as well.
[03:19:45.706 --> 03:19:51.650]  Did you know that pH balance is one of the most important factors in maintaining high energy and vibrant health?
[03:19:51.650 --> 03:19:56.433]  Most experts agree that the water you drink should be at a pH level of 9 or higher.
[03:19:56.433 --> 03:20:01.856]  Plasma pH drops combine a unique formula of the most alkaline minerals and elements.
[03:20:01.856 --> 03:20:05.298]  This product is a one-of-a-kind in its strength and effectiveness.
[03:20:05.778 --> 03:20:14.281]  Using plasma pH drops is one of the best ways to make your water alkaline while helping you get rid of acid and regaining your health and energy.
[03:20:14.281 --> 03:20:20.103]  With just 10 drops, you can raise the pH level of the water you drink up to the pH of 10.
[03:20:20.103 --> 03:20:26.085]  Alkalizing water helps the body rid itself of acidic waste and increases the oxygen content of your body.
[03:20:26.085 --> 03:20:31.347]  Disease organisms like bacteria and cancer cannot survive in an alkaline environment.
[03:20:31.347 --> 03:20:34.288]  Order your bottle of AlkaVision Plasma pH Drops now.
[03:20:34.468 --> 03:20:34.789]  That's right.
[03:20:45.302 --> 03:20:46.362]  Hello, Ted Anderson.
[03:20:46.362 --> 03:20:51.304]  Listeners of the network are familiar with the Federal Reserve Note and understand the risks of deficit spending.
[03:20:51.304 --> 03:20:59.367]  Therefore, with catastrophic events, it comes as no surprise that some banks have currently placed limits on the amount of cash depositors can remove from their accounts.
[03:20:59.367 --> 03:21:04.709]  A fractional reserve system means only a small portion of your deposit is held in reserve for immediate withdrawal.
[03:21:04.949 --> 03:21:12.235]  Deficit spending will skyrocket through FDIC if the government is forced to insure deposits during a bank run followed by a depressed economy.
[03:21:12.235 --> 03:21:17.840]  A current effort is underway by the Fed along with other central banks to increase liquidity for depositors.
[03:21:17.840 --> 03:21:22.904]  However, an increase in money supply without equal expansion in productivity can cause inflation.
[03:21:22.904 --> 03:21:30.491]  In order to achieve strength and stability, I recommend a conservative portion of all investments to be calmly repositioned into gold and silver.
[03:21:30.831 --> 03:21:37.395]  While paper investments currently have been driven by debt, gold on its own has held value for over 6,000 years.
[03:21:37.395 --> 03:21:41.257]  For more information, call 1-800-686-2237.
[03:21:41.257 --> 03:21:41.857]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[03:21:41.857 --> 03:21:46.500]  Our beloved republic is on her knees.
[03:21:46.500 --> 03:21:50.122]  The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide.
[03:21:50.122 --> 03:21:51.923]  But in liberty's darkest hour, there is hope.
[03:21:52.563 --> 03:21:55.605]  The first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[03:21:55.605 --> 03:22:01.328]  It is essential that patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding of the New World Order Master Plan.
[03:22:01.328 --> 03:22:05.591]  We have a short time frame to fully awaken and energize the people to meet this threat.

[03:23:52.623 --> 03:24:00.067]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:24:00.067 --> 03:24:00.587]  State Rep.
[03:24:00.587 --> 03:24:02.067]  Charles Key is our guest.
[03:24:02.067 --> 03:24:04.328]  We talk about courage.
[03:24:04.328 --> 03:24:17.114]  From day one when there was the questions coming out with the Oklahoma City bombing, which was an inside job from the beginning, he was there questioning, exposing, speaking out.
[03:24:17.114 --> 03:24:18.175]  And now in hindsight,
[03:24:19.281 --> 03:24:23.023]  Talking 12 years later or more.
[03:24:23.023 --> 03:24:25.243]  It's just all coming out.
[03:24:25.243 --> 03:24:26.744]  It is all coming out in a big way.
[03:24:26.744 --> 03:24:32.606]  So I want to shift gears into that for the rest of the interview with our guest today and any other subjects he wants to talk about.
[03:24:32.606 --> 03:24:37.588]  But as a state rep for all our listeners in Oklahoma, please support him.
[03:24:37.588 --> 03:24:40.310]  I mean, I know he was happy to be out of politics.
[03:24:40.310 --> 03:24:41.270]  Why did you get back in?
[03:24:42.546 --> 03:24:44.268]  Well, it was just kind of circumstantial.
[03:24:44.268 --> 03:24:51.617]  There was some people that asked me to run when the guy that was in there just chose not to run somewhat at the last minute.
[03:24:54.583 --> 03:24:56.205]  You know, that was just that simple.
[03:24:56.205 --> 03:25:04.512]  There was another guy running that some of them didn't think he was a conservative, and they said, we want a conservative in there, and we've got to have a conservative, and we want you to run.
[03:25:04.512 --> 03:25:07.395]  So I thought about it, prayed about it, and boom, did it.
[03:25:07.395 --> 03:25:10.037]  And they did the same thing they did to me before.
[03:25:10.037 --> 03:25:15.642]  They just blew me out of the water about the Oklahoma City bombing, but we prevailed, and God gave us a victory.
[03:25:15.642 --> 03:25:18.064]  So that's just it.
[03:25:18.064 --> 03:25:19.606]  Yeah, they attack you when
[03:25:20.552 --> 03:25:24.014]  Most Oklahomans I talk to know what's going on.
[03:25:24.014 --> 03:25:29.939]  Did that backfire on them, that the story's gotten out now and that that made your competitors look stupid?
[03:25:29.939 --> 03:25:30.759]  Yeah, I think it is.
[03:25:30.759 --> 03:25:37.644]  I think, you know, it's a lot like the Oklahoma City bombing cases, a lot like JFK and a lot of other cases that we could enumerate.
[03:25:37.644 --> 03:25:40.326]  You talk about it on your program many times.
[03:25:40.326 --> 03:25:42.687]  You know, as time goes by, more of the truth comes out.
[03:25:42.687 --> 03:25:43.588]  People have time.
[03:25:43.588 --> 03:25:44.749]  The emotional part of it,
[03:25:45.222 --> 03:25:57.654]  You know, subsides, it goes away, people have a chance to hear more, think more, and get more facts, and they realize that there was a cover-up, and that's what's happened in the Oklahoma City bombing case.
[03:25:57.654 --> 03:26:00.437]  I guess you probably had Jesse Trinidad on your program.
[03:26:00.437 --> 03:26:01.318]  Oh, yes.
[03:26:01.318 --> 03:26:06.022]  And that guy, talk about a bulldog and a courageous man.
[03:26:06.022 --> 03:26:09.125]  He has continued to keep this thing alive, and he has helped.
[03:26:10.228 --> 03:26:15.271]  Continue to verify what all of us were saying back in the beginning.
[03:26:15.271 --> 03:26:15.892]  Well, that's it.
[03:26:15.892 --> 03:26:20.855]  Ten, eleven years ago, everything you said has turned out, your angle on it has turned out to be right.
[03:26:20.855 --> 03:26:26.979]  In fact, break down the Jesse Trinidou case for those that may have forgotten, because that was probably six, eight months ago we were really talking about this.
[03:26:26.979 --> 03:26:29.961]  I mean, break down all the new things that have been confirmed.
[03:26:29.961 --> 03:26:36.585]  Well, it's been hard for me to keep on top of it like I did the bombing case when I was involved in that, but I can hit the highlights.
[03:26:36.585 --> 03:26:39.547]  Jesse Trinidou is an attorney up in the Salt Lake City area.
[03:26:40.086 --> 03:26:44.609]  He had a brother who died in Oklahoma City in August of 95.
[03:26:44.609 --> 03:26:46.511]  The bombing happened in April.
[03:26:46.511 --> 03:26:52.936]  And his brother died in a federal transfer center that happened to be in my district, by the way, right next to the airport.
[03:26:52.936 --> 03:27:02.062]  And when the family realized that he didn't commit suicide like the Bureau of Prisons claimed, so they filed a lawsuit.
[03:27:02.062 --> 03:27:04.024]  As time went by, they were able to force
[03:27:04.764 --> 03:27:12.046]  Documents out of the government, through the Freedom of Information Act, they found out that it was related to the Oklahoma City bombing somehow.
[03:27:12.046 --> 03:27:24.110]  What happened was some federal investigators, FBI and who knows who else, thought that he was a suspect in the Oklahoma City bombing case and they beat him to death, literally.
[03:27:24.110 --> 03:27:30.732]  And so the family filed suit, they eventually won that suit, and the Trinidad and the family have not let go.
[03:27:31.641 --> 03:27:36.284]  Become impassioned, not just for... Well, let me just add, he also had electrical burns all over him.
[03:27:36.284 --> 03:27:38.526]  Yeah, go ahead.
[03:27:38.526 --> 03:27:56.779]  And they're impassioned about this, not just because they wanted to bring justice to what really happened in regards to their brother and son's murder, but also because they found out how terribly screwed up this Oklahoma City bombing case was, and how the truth was really being
[03:27:57.327 --> 03:27:58.328]  Covered up.
[03:27:58.328 --> 03:28:10.315]  So Jesse Trinidu, and you know, we should also give kudos to a federal judge up in the Salt Lake area, I think his last name is Kimball, has not let the Justice Department and the FBI off the hook easy.
[03:28:10.315 --> 03:28:14.098]  It made them have to live under the laws that the rest of us have to live under.
[03:28:14.098 --> 03:28:16.319]  And he said things like, this is a cover-up.
[03:28:16.319 --> 03:28:20.001]  I mean, it's amazing to actually have a good federal judge.
[03:28:20.001 --> 03:28:25.605]  Yeah, you know, even the Judge Mache that presided over McVeigh in Nichols trials, even,
[03:28:26.303 --> 03:28:32.905]  Made a couple of comments like that back early on, so there's no question about that it was a major cover-up.
[03:28:32.905 --> 03:28:40.908]  There were other people involved, and they had a level, at minimum, a level of prior knowledge that something was going to happen.
[03:28:40.908 --> 03:28:49.991]  And, you know, there were government informants inside the circle, or these circles of individuals that were, you know, going to carry this out, or they were participating in it.
[03:28:50.635 --> 03:28:52.136]  And, you know, the list just goes on.
[03:28:52.136 --> 03:28:59.419]  But how could you be criticized when you had grand jurors and people coming to you saying there's other bombers and I'm being told to shut up?
[03:28:59.419 --> 03:29:03.560]  I mean, that's your job as a state rep to speak out.
[03:29:03.560 --> 03:29:07.942]  Well, you know, there are folks that they want to go along.
[03:29:07.942 --> 03:29:13.724]  They're more interested in climbing up a ladder, whether it's politically or corporately or whatever.
[03:29:13.724 --> 03:29:14.865]  And that's what it gets down to.
[03:29:15.598 --> 03:29:15.978]  Stay there.
[03:29:15.978 --> 03:29:22.822]  I want to run through the basics of what you know about the Oklahoma City bombing and who you think is really behind it and involved.
[03:29:22.822 --> 03:29:29.486]  We've got a clearer picture today than we've ever had before, and we'll take calls on the resolution, throwing the feds out, re-declaring state liberty.
[03:29:29.486 --> 03:29:35.790]  1-800-259-9231 is the toll-free number to call in.
[03:29:35.790 --> 03:29:37.171]  We're on the march.
[03:29:37.171 --> 03:29:39.712]  The empire's on the run.
[03:29:39.712 --> 03:29:42.374]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:29:47.392 --> 03:29:53.054]  Are you tired of hearing that a cure for cancer is coming, but it will be available sometime in the future?

[03:31:46.660 --> 03:31:49.483]  A New World Order.
[03:31:49.483 --> 03:31:54.367]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful new government.
[03:31:54.367 --> 03:31:57.210]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[03:31:57.210 --> 03:31:59.992]  Couldn't their objective be world domination?
[03:31:59.992 --> 03:32:03.175]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[03:32:03.175 --> 03:32:10.502]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.

[03:32:26.557 --> 03:32:27.337]  They're not after money.
[03:32:27.337 --> 03:32:28.618]  They have all the money they need.
[03:32:28.618 --> 03:32:29.618]  They're after power.
[03:32:29.618 --> 03:32:30.759]  That's their aphrodisiac.
[03:32:30.759 --> 03:32:34.901]  Order in-game on DVD at PrisonPlanet.com or InfoWars.com.

[03:32:42.264 --> 03:32:46.825]  You have been warned.
[03:32:46.825 --> 03:32:50.307]  Man thinks, cause he rules the earth.
[03:32:50.307 --> 03:32:54.288]  He can do it as he please.
[03:32:54.288 --> 03:33:02.011]  And if things don't, change soon, he will.
[03:33:02.011 --> 03:33:04.592]  For man has invented his doom.
[03:33:11.560 --> 03:33:12.741]  Charles Key is our guest.
[03:33:12.741 --> 03:33:14.282]  I'm very thankful for his time today.
[03:33:14.282 --> 03:33:16.324]  Steve, Greg, John, Charles, many others.
[03:33:16.324 --> 03:33:21.488]  We're going to go to your calls here in a few minutes for State Rep Charles Key.
[03:33:21.488 --> 03:33:23.729]  When he's done in the Statehouse, we need to send him to Washington.
[03:33:23.729 --> 03:33:26.531]  We need some good people in Washington.
[03:33:26.531 --> 03:33:29.073]  There's only Ron Paul and a few others up there.
[03:33:29.073 --> 03:33:32.456]  Republicans and conservatives' names have been destroyed thanks to Bush.
[03:33:33.379 --> 03:33:34.620]  Tripling the size of government.
[03:33:34.620 --> 03:33:38.523]  Now we're looking at Barack Obama or McCain.
[03:33:38.523 --> 03:33:52.174]  Charles, before we get back in Oklahoma City and take calls, sometimes you gotta wonder, I mean, the elites are just running this country into the ground, and I'm just wondering if there's any hope the way things are going.
[03:33:52.174 --> 03:33:53.275]  There's hope.
[03:33:53.275 --> 03:33:55.697]  You know, I think there's always hope, but I feel the same way.
[03:33:55.697 --> 03:34:03.043]  I get discouraged and down, but as long as we, you know, we have a certain amount of freedom, and we still do in this country,
[03:34:03.757 --> 03:34:13.585]  But back to the 10th Amendment, you were talking about the Oklahoma City bombing and how they could attack somebody or criticize them for just asking questions and wanting some truth.
[03:34:13.585 --> 03:34:23.033]  Well, look at McCain-Feingold and a lot of the other things they've done over the past few years to just try and control your ability to speak freely, like on this radio program.
[03:34:23.033 --> 03:34:26.276]  Because there are those that don't want us to even talk about this.
[03:34:26.276 --> 03:34:27.416]  And that's what they do.
[03:34:27.416 --> 03:34:32.801]  One of the things they do is they will attack you publicly and call you all kinds of names
[03:34:33.410 --> 03:34:37.334]  You know, and spin off the truth and tell a lot of untruths.
[03:34:37.334 --> 03:34:47.384]  And since the Oklahoma City bombing, just look at the legislation that's been passed to restrict what you can say and where you can say it.
[03:34:47.384 --> 03:34:50.447]  You know, there's what they call them speech-free zones.
[03:34:50.447 --> 03:34:56.913]  If you get in some of those zones where there's a presidential motorcade or the president's there or some other political
[03:34:57.403 --> 03:34:57.763]  I don't know.
[03:35:21.725 --> 03:35:23.406]  And I think, you know, I hear more and more people.
[03:35:23.406 --> 03:35:39.570]  What's been interesting in my experience coming back into the legislative political realm this last couple of years is when I went out and knocked doors in 06, running for this seat again, it was very, very surprising to me and encouraging, very encouraging.
[03:35:39.570 --> 03:35:43.731]  How many people going door to door, and these are Republicans, though, are the only doors I knocked.
[03:35:44.289 --> 03:35:46.511]  That are very aware of what's going on in this country.
[03:35:46.511 --> 03:35:47.852]  There's a great awakening going on.
[03:35:47.852 --> 03:35:49.953]  Well, see, that's what I was going to ask you next.
[03:35:49.953 --> 03:35:58.220]  Whereas things are getting darkest before the dawn, I'm saying they're bad, I'm finding the same thing that people finally are knowing, they're finally listening.
[03:35:58.220 --> 03:35:59.220]  Go ahead and finish your story.
[03:35:59.220 --> 03:36:01.102]  Tell me what happened when you knocked on those doors.
[03:36:02.095 --> 03:36:14.180]  People are aware they're getting their information from someplace other than the nightly news and the newspaper, and they're starting to find out that they're getting lied to, and there's something really rotten in Denmark, so to speak.
[03:36:14.180 --> 03:36:15.480]  And they're waking up.
[03:36:15.480 --> 03:36:25.244]  And a lot of this is pretty obvious stuff, like when you've got the immigration problems like we have, and you've got a government that refuses to do something about it.
[03:36:25.876 --> 03:36:26.737]  Or so many in general.
[03:36:40.683 --> 03:36:49.825]  Well, you know, there's so many people, and this is a part of the answer to what happened in the Oklahoma City case when they came after me and other cases that other people have been involved in.
[03:36:49.825 --> 03:37:01.248]  There's always a section of people, and I talked about this on your program years ago, there's always a percentage of the people, when they hear things like a cover-up about Oklahoma City or anything else, they do not want to hear it.
[03:37:01.248 --> 03:37:07.309]  It puts so much fear into them, and their reaction is they want to kill the messenger.
[03:37:07.309 --> 03:37:09.610]  And they'll go along, they'll be cheerleaders,
[03:37:10.256 --> 03:37:10.557]  We're good.
[03:37:19.969 --> 03:37:31.777]  Because they'll come out of their denial because after a while they'll see, and this is what I think I'm seeing today, more people starting to wake up and realize, hey, there really is something to X, you know, or what he said.
[03:37:31.777 --> 03:37:38.401]  Well, I agree with you because what I run into is there's a certain amount of people who want to live in denial and say everything's fine no matter what's going on.
[03:37:38.401 --> 03:37:39.762]  They say, we're being negative.
[03:37:39.762 --> 03:37:40.362]  No, no, no.
[03:37:40.362 --> 03:37:43.925]  We're trying to protect what's good by admitting what's bad.
[03:37:43.925 --> 03:37:47.807]  You know, it's like if I have a fly in my soup, I don't say, oh, I'm not going to be negative and eat it.
[03:37:47.807 --> 03:37:48.728]  I take the fly out.
[03:37:49.932 --> 03:37:53.253]  Well, one of our investigators used this analogy, and I love it.
[03:37:53.253 --> 03:37:56.534]  I've used it a lot of times back when we were investigating the bombing.
[03:37:56.534 --> 03:38:04.537]  He was a retired officer in the Marine Corps, a good guy, and he said, you know, he said, Charles, I bet it's like, it's like a ship.
[03:38:04.537 --> 03:38:05.537]  He says, most people don't know this.
[03:38:05.537 --> 03:38:11.139]  When a ship starts taking on water in the ocean, you think it would just, you know, you know, go on over.
[03:38:11.139 --> 03:38:12.760]  But he said it actually gets to be about 17 degrees.
[03:38:14.218 --> 03:38:16.880]  That's what he said, I'm assuming it's true or accurate.
[03:38:16.880 --> 03:38:20.882]  It gets to about 17 degrees and it just flops on over.
[03:38:20.882 --> 03:38:24.564]  And he said that's how this public opinion and things will happen some days.
[03:38:24.564 --> 03:38:28.787]  It'll just keep mounting and mounting until all of a sudden the people will wake up.
[03:38:28.787 --> 03:38:29.628]  No, I agree.
[03:38:29.628 --> 03:38:30.908]  And that's what they're afraid of.
[03:38:30.908 --> 03:38:32.169]  It's a flashpoint.
[03:38:32.169 --> 03:38:34.110]  It's a flashpoint.
[03:38:34.110 --> 03:38:36.752]  It happens in jumps.
[03:38:36.752 --> 03:38:41.095]  And those that are, you know, we recognize that there are enemies.
[03:38:41.095 --> 03:38:43.396]  There are enemies of a constitutional form of government.
[03:38:44.062 --> 03:38:47.345]  They know that, and they're afraid of it.
[03:38:47.345 --> 03:38:49.587]  And we need to use that to our advantage.
[03:38:49.587 --> 03:38:49.907]  I agree.
[03:38:49.907 --> 03:38:50.708]  Well, I'll tell you this.
[03:38:50.708 --> 03:38:54.311]  Globalists just five years ago, six years ago, still were arrogant.
[03:38:54.311 --> 03:38:55.572]  I look at their body language now.
[03:38:55.572 --> 03:38:56.814]  I go to events.
[03:38:56.814 --> 03:39:07.203]  They look freaked out, but I don't think it's even freaked out about us as much as it is a lot of economists I talk to think they've lost control, that they have just totally screwed everything up.
[03:39:07.907 --> 03:39:20.686]  Yeah, that's another thing that wakes people up, unfortunately, because we've heard that, you know, all of our lives, because it's true that there's a lot of people that never will wake up until, you know, their back pocket, you know, their pocketbook gets hit hard enough and the people are getting hit hard.
[03:39:20.686 --> 03:39:22.509]  And so a lot of them are going to wake up for that reason.
[03:39:22.509 --> 03:39:23.270]  It's unfortunate.
[03:39:24.194 --> 03:39:26.476]  But if it works for us, that's fine.
[03:39:26.476 --> 03:39:29.078]  You know, we need everything to our advantage that we can get.
[03:39:29.078 --> 03:39:31.819]  Yeah, but it looks like they're pocketbooked.
[03:39:31.819 --> 03:39:34.421]  If they think this is bad, they ain't seen nothing yet, as they say.
[03:39:34.421 --> 03:39:38.724]  I mean, if this continues, it's going to be unbelievable.
[03:39:38.724 --> 03:39:40.105]  Let's talk to Stephen Colorado.
[03:39:40.105 --> 03:39:43.047]  You're on the air with Charles Key, State Rep.
[03:39:43.047 --> 03:39:44.428]  Hello there, Alex.
[03:39:44.428 --> 03:39:44.728]  Hi.
[03:39:44.728 --> 03:39:46.909]  Hello, Representative Key.
[03:39:46.909 --> 03:39:47.510]  I think one of the
[03:39:48.075 --> 03:39:59.063]  Main reasons why people want to shoot the messenger so much is because they don't want to actually have to believe that their government is degraded into such a despicable situation.
[03:39:59.063 --> 03:40:04.727]  And then also another reason is because they might actually have to do something with the knowledge that they found out.
[03:40:04.727 --> 03:40:05.928]  Yeah, I agree with you.
[03:40:05.928 --> 03:40:09.831]  But then they might find out how bad it's going to be if they don't do something.
[03:40:09.831 --> 03:40:11.952]  Then they really would do something.
[03:40:11.952 --> 03:40:14.534]  Well, that's an interesting point, too.
[03:40:14.534 --> 03:40:15.395]  My questions were,
[03:40:16.496 --> 03:40:28.483]  I had heard the story, I guess, about helicopters taking some of the federal people off the roof of the Murrah Building.
[03:40:28.483 --> 03:40:32.346]  Do you know that to be true at all?
[03:40:32.346 --> 03:40:34.727]  I mean, prior to the blast?
[03:40:34.727 --> 03:40:37.469]  No, never found any truth to that.
[03:40:37.469 --> 03:40:41.651]  There were stories that were hearsay.
[03:40:41.651 --> 03:40:42.792]  Nothing we could ever really get into.
[03:40:42.792 --> 03:40:44.413]  Why wouldn't they just walk out the front?
[03:40:45.256 --> 03:40:47.298]  Well, because they didn't want to alarm anybody.
[03:40:47.298 --> 03:40:50.580]  From what I understand, they went out of rooftop exit.
[03:40:50.580 --> 03:40:53.222]  By helicopter wouldn't alarm people?
[03:40:53.222 --> 03:40:55.043]  Well, that's just what I had heard.
[03:40:55.043 --> 03:40:59.507]  I didn't know for sure whether that was true.
[03:40:59.507 --> 03:41:01.168]  Yeah, we don't know that.
[03:41:01.168 --> 03:41:03.229]  I don't know if there's any way to prove that.
[03:41:03.229 --> 03:41:06.612]  We work real hard at that and so many other clues and
[03:41:07.315 --> 03:41:08.495]  By the way, operative word, bombings.
[03:41:08.495 --> 03:41:08.916]  Thank you, Steve.
[03:41:08.916 --> 03:41:10.196]  We know there were multiple bombs.
[03:41:10.196 --> 03:41:11.696]  Can you explain how you can say that?
[03:41:29.600 --> 03:41:30.840]  Well, there's just too many experts.
[03:41:30.840 --> 03:41:38.342]  You know, this is a subject that is difficult for most people because they don't understand all this, and I was one of those.
[03:41:38.342 --> 03:41:43.063]  I learned a lot, learned a lot more than I ever would have, you know, if I hadn't been involved in the bombing.
[03:41:43.063 --> 03:41:47.584]  But you've got experts, people that have done this all their lives, like General Partin and many others.
[03:41:47.584 --> 03:41:53.225]  And we've got some of those in that report that we published that come out and analyze, and this is what they do for a living.
[03:41:53.225 --> 03:41:57.126]  They've done it all their lives in the military and in commercial application.
[03:41:58.077 --> 03:42:01.179]  They analyze terrorist bombs, bombings.
[03:42:01.179 --> 03:42:07.003]  They analyze tests that they do at Eglin Air Force Base that's been talked about a lot.
[03:42:07.003 --> 03:42:11.046]  And they know how these things work and what will and won't happen.
[03:42:11.046 --> 03:42:15.949]  And they can analyze a case like this and say, well, here's what happened.
[03:42:15.949 --> 03:42:17.910]  Here's how many bombs were used.
[03:42:17.910 --> 03:42:20.472]  Here's where they were placed, etc., etc.
[03:42:20.472 --> 03:42:25.355]  The experts have looked at it, analyzed it, and concluded that multiple bombs were used.
[03:42:32.591 --> 03:42:36.757]  Am I still on?
[03:42:36.757 --> 03:42:38.439]  Okay.
[03:42:38.439 --> 03:42:42.985]  So that's how we know about the number of bombs.
[03:42:42.985 --> 03:42:47.491]  People like General Partin and others.
[03:42:47.491 --> 03:42:48.973]  Sorry, I was sitting there messing with my board.
[03:42:50.632 --> 03:43:05.982]  Representative Key, going back to the BATF, what we do know is they showed up in their bomb gear seconds after the blast and were telling EMTs and people that showed up to dress wounds and say that they'd seen them up in the higher floors.
[03:43:05.982 --> 03:43:08.584]  What do you think was behind that?
[03:43:08.584 --> 03:43:09.664]  Well, it's pretty interesting.
[03:43:09.664 --> 03:43:18.370]  You know, you had an AP reporter that's been around for a long time and he gave that testimony on videotape.
[03:43:19.028 --> 03:43:34.760]  That he was immediately on the scene, and he said immediately these ATF officials showed up with the black gear, you know, all decked out in their black SWAT team type gear, like they were poised, ready for this to happen.
[03:43:34.760 --> 03:43:37.642]  And that's where that information comes from.
[03:43:37.642 --> 03:43:46.108]  Also, related to that is the Oklahoma City Fire Department getting some call the Friday before the Wednesday bombing about
[03:43:46.947 --> 03:43:53.270]  Uh, them being in a higher prepared state for something that may be developing over the next several days.
[03:43:53.270 --> 03:43:57.993]  And then we also have the BATF out at a base testing, blowing up trucks?
[03:43:57.993 --> 03:44:03.516]  Yeah, out in New Mexico we're blowing up trucks with AMFO bombs.
[03:44:03.516 --> 03:44:06.117]  Very interesting also, to say the least.
[03:44:06.678 --> 03:44:29.257]  And then this is in the months before and of course you're not just saying the experts say multiple bombs or how does a truck bomb not blow the pillars out right in front of the pillars the same size way back in the back of the building and then why were chunks of it blown across the street and why were there blast points on the on the on the rebar I mean all of that you also have the governor coming on who obviously wasn't involved because he was you know he would he
[03:44:30.214 --> 03:44:31.234]  Or he wouldn't have been saying this.
[03:44:31.234 --> 03:44:34.515]  Yeah, we found multiple bombs, very sophisticated bombs inside.
[03:44:34.515 --> 03:44:39.716]  And then the BATF shows up and says, no, that's not what you saw.
[03:44:39.716 --> 03:44:42.317]  Yeah, and then you had another bomb expert.
[03:44:42.317 --> 03:44:56.341]  I mean, they've got a bunch of them, but you have another terrorism and bomb expert that was on one of the local stations that came in studio just, you know, a few hours after the bombing and was reporting also that, yeah, that we've just found out that they found other unexploded bombs that they've taken out of the building.
[03:44:56.341 --> 03:44:57.681]  And this is really great because
[03:44:58.530 --> 03:45:05.517]  As they take these apart, it's going to help us find out who did it and be able to track them down and hold them accountable, blah, blah, blah.
[03:45:05.517 --> 03:45:08.179]  So, you know, just all kinds of information like that.
[03:45:08.179 --> 03:45:22.292]  I'll tell you, some of the stuff that Jesse Trinidad, the attorney we were talking about earlier, has been able to force out that further sheds light on this case is the information about Andreas, or otherwise known as Andy Strassmayer, the West German
[03:45:22.955 --> 03:45:23.995]  The Southern Poverty Law Center?
[03:45:47.049 --> 03:45:47.590]  Involved.
[03:45:47.590 --> 03:45:52.053]  I mean, it's just despicable activities, but they've got to get our guns one way or the other.
[03:45:52.053 --> 03:45:53.034]  Uh, just amazing.
[03:45:53.034 --> 03:45:57.817]  And then the fact that McVeigh, uh, was a government operative coming out in affidavits.
[03:45:57.817 --> 03:45:59.259]  It's just incredible.
[03:45:59.259 --> 03:46:01.180]  Uh, Greg in New Jersey, you're on the air.
[03:46:01.180 --> 03:46:02.281]  Go ahead.
[03:46:02.281 --> 03:46:03.282]  Oh, thank you very much.
[03:46:03.282 --> 03:46:06.544]  And, uh, thank you, uh, for putting me on.
[03:46:06.544 --> 03:46:07.785]  It's kind of ironic.
[03:46:07.785 --> 03:46:13.950]  Here at Oklahoma, they're used, they're, they're stating their, their rights to be left alone from the federal government.
[03:46:13.950 --> 03:46:16.552]  And here in New Jersey, which is no doubt our, our
[03:46:17.003 --> 03:46:20.857]  Our representative government in the state is the criminal syndicate.
[03:46:20.857 --> 03:46:22.162]  We actually have the U.S.
[03:46:22.162 --> 03:46:22.684]  Attorney!
[03:46:23.314 --> 03:46:25.715]  Doing the work that New Jersey's attorneys should be doing.
[03:46:25.715 --> 03:46:30.918]  We have a thousand attorneys working for the state government in New Jersey, yet they have to use the federal U.S.
[03:46:30.918 --> 03:46:34.540]  attorney to prosecute the corrupt politicians that are here.
[03:46:34.540 --> 03:46:36.461]  So far, they've nailed, like, the mayor of Newark.
[03:46:36.461 --> 03:46:37.521]  Well, that's another problem.
[03:46:37.521 --> 03:46:39.763]  They'll never go after locals with the state.
[03:46:39.763 --> 03:46:43.524]  It's like it's supposedly the purview of the feds, who are even more corrupt.
[03:46:43.524 --> 03:46:46.666]  Very dangerous violation of states' rights.
[03:46:46.666 --> 03:46:46.906]  Mr. Key?
[03:46:46.906 --> 03:46:49.708]  Yeah, it's unfortunate.
[03:46:49.708 --> 03:46:52.169]  I had somebody on another program several days ago.
[03:46:53.290 --> 03:47:03.972]  Call me up and talk about the civil rights laws and how the feds had to come in and prosecute people for, you know, racial types of crimes and what have you.
[03:47:03.972 --> 03:47:04.972]  So that's a tough issue.
[03:47:04.972 --> 03:47:14.294]  You get down the path, you know, you buy into the federal government having a good role and the only one that can fix, you know, make some wrongs right.
[03:47:14.294 --> 03:47:16.495]  And it kind of gets things all screwed up.
[03:47:16.495 --> 03:47:20.616]  Well, they play that game in Europe where the nations, they won't let the people ever go to those courts.
[03:47:20.616 --> 03:47:21.896]  They've got to go to the EU court.
[03:47:22.923 --> 03:47:27.366]  And so it's handing your authority away when you have less control over the Feds.
[03:47:27.366 --> 03:47:28.567]  Anything else, Greg?
[03:47:28.567 --> 03:47:34.691]  Well, my question was, do you think that's a good thing or a bad thing where we have to actually ask the U.S.
[03:47:34.691 --> 03:47:35.951]  Attorney to get involved in this?
[03:47:35.951 --> 03:47:43.116]  Yeah, I think it's a bad thing because the Feds are even so much more corrupt, and they'll only selectively enforce on who they want.
[03:47:43.116 --> 03:47:45.177]  I mean, I think that really is a state matter.
[03:47:45.177 --> 03:47:48.119]  Well, the problem is always the people, not
[03:47:48.872 --> 03:47:50.312]  Uh, holding their government accountable.
[03:47:50.312 --> 03:47:51.733]  That's always the problem.
[03:47:51.733 --> 03:47:52.193]  Yeah.
[03:47:52.193 --> 03:47:59.075]  Because you could fix these things at the state level if the people would watch their government and hold people accountable and make them fix it.
[03:47:59.075 --> 03:48:00.235]  Yeah, here's an example.
[03:48:00.235 --> 03:48:03.196]  Who do you go to with the Feds engaged in terrorism?
[03:48:03.196 --> 03:48:08.057]  I mean, they admit they staged the USS Liberty, they staged the Gulf of Tonkin, a bunch of other events.
[03:48:08.057 --> 03:48:10.318]  Who do we go to about our own government staging things?
[03:48:10.318 --> 03:48:15.079]  I mean, going to the Feds, you know, whoever's got more power almost always is going to be more corrupt.
[03:48:15.695 --> 03:48:25.139]  Yeah, the problem, and another way of stating that, too, is the problem is it assumes that somehow the federal government is more moral or ethical or something.
[03:48:25.139 --> 03:48:25.739]  And they're not.
[03:48:25.739 --> 03:48:35.123]  Just like Alex is saying, you know, they're just people, and they're corrupt, too, and they're going to use their power for things other than, you know, what's best for all of us.
[03:48:35.123 --> 03:48:35.423]  Yeah.
[03:48:35.423 --> 03:48:36.343]  Let's take another call.
[03:48:36.343 --> 03:48:36.924]  Thanks, Greg.
[03:48:36.924 --> 03:48:38.364]  John in Fort Worth, Texas.
[03:48:38.364 --> 03:48:41.045]  You're on the air with Representative Keith.
[03:48:41.045 --> 03:48:41.245]  Hi.
[03:48:41.245 --> 03:48:42.626]  Thank you for taking my call.
[03:48:42.626 --> 03:48:44.467]  I just wanted to ask the representative.
[03:48:45.851 --> 03:49:02.403]  How did, after Oklahoma City, how did the, in general, the majority of people in Oklahoma, did they go along with the status that was given to them, or was there a lot of trepidation in what happened?
[03:49:02.403 --> 03:49:14.211]  Well, I think, and I've come to describe it this way, and I think I always probably will, the answer to that kind of question is that people were traumatized all over the country, but especially right here
[03:49:15.083 --> 03:49:24.587]  At ground, at the ground central or whatever, I'm trying to say, at that, right here where it happened, right here in Oklahoma City.
[03:49:24.587 --> 03:49:28.769]  I mean, people were just traumatized by this.
[03:49:28.769 --> 03:49:36.392]  They had, you know, it's hard to find somebody that didn't know someone or had a relative that was killed or badly hurt.
[03:49:36.392 --> 03:49:38.553]  And then it went on.
[03:49:38.553 --> 03:49:40.033]  It didn't just go away after that.
[03:49:40.033 --> 03:49:41.174]  It went on for years.
[03:49:42.080 --> 03:49:43.502]  And so people got tired of it.
[03:49:43.502 --> 03:49:46.785]  They were emotionally just... Sick of it.
[03:49:46.785 --> 03:49:47.806]  ...wrenched, you know.
[03:49:47.806 --> 03:49:55.273]  But I mean, how did they deal with all those newscasts reporting the bombs, and then later newscasts saying there were Iraqis involved in all this?
[03:49:55.273 --> 03:50:00.138]  I mean, I mean, you would... I mean, when they call you a kook, would you raise those points, or...?
[03:50:00.138 --> 03:50:05.483]  Yeah, and I think most people believed it, but I think it was an emotional thing is why they eventually go along
[03:50:06.164 --> 03:50:15.507]  You know, they kind of go along with the entities, whether it's the newspapers or other politicians that attack the messenger.
[03:50:15.507 --> 03:50:18.889]  They go along with them because it's an emotional... Yeah, it's too scary.
[03:50:18.889 --> 03:50:20.529]  It's too scary to admit the truth.
[03:50:20.529 --> 03:50:22.430]  Thank you, John.
[03:50:22.430 --> 03:50:28.352]  Charles in New Hampshire, final caller for Representative Charles Key, coming up after
[03:50:29.557 --> 03:50:35.148]  This quick break, so we've got a final segment coming up straight ahead.
[03:50:35.148 --> 03:50:38.435]  We've got a lot of other callers, but we'll see how many we can get in here.
[03:50:38.435 --> 03:50:38.695]  Okay.
[03:50:46.041 --> 03:50:49.562]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[03:50:49.562 --> 03:50:54.963]  And did you know that you have greater exposure to these chemicals while taking hot showers than when drinking the water?
[03:50:54.963 --> 03:51:00.104]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed into the skin.
[03:51:00.104 --> 03:51:11.227]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter works with both hot and cold water, and it's designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus.
[03:51:11.627 --> 03:51:17.411]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter typically lasts 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[03:51:17.411 --> 03:51:23.676]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[03:51:23.676 --> 03:51:24.716]  What about you?

[03:51:49.932 --> 03:51:52.094]  Endgame, blueprint for global enslavement.
[03:51:52.094 --> 03:51:53.995]  The true story of the Bilderberg Group.

[03:52:44.710 --> 03:52:47.891]  If you're an adult male, you need to listen to this information.
[03:52:47.891 --> 03:52:52.012]  By the age of 60, half of all men have a prostate-related problem.
[03:52:52.012 --> 03:52:58.614]  In the past, many men have turned to saw palmetto to support prostate health, but now there's something much better.
[03:52:58.614 --> 03:53:00.254]  It's called beta-prostate.
[03:53:00.254 --> 03:53:05.775]  Beta-prostate contains 3,000 times more healthy plant sterols than ordinary saw palmetto.
[03:53:05.775 --> 03:53:11.677]  In fact, you'd have to take a hundred saw palmetto capsules to get the same benefits of one dose of beta-prostate.
[03:53:11.957 --> 03:53:17.679]  It's guaranteed to provide noticeable support, even if you're already having prostate-related health issues.
[03:53:17.679 --> 03:53:21.781]  Now you can get Roger Mason's Beta Prostate Formula through this special offer.

[03:53:45.384 --> 03:53:57.251]  Getting you thinking, that's what we're doing here.
[03:53:57.251 --> 03:54:00.173]  Monday through Friday.
[03:54:13.444 --> 03:54:15.905]  Well, I really don't have anything prepared to pass on, Alex.
[03:54:32.000 --> 03:54:38.804]  Well, I just want to thank you for your tireless defense of the Republic, and I just wish we had more people like you in public service.
[03:54:38.804 --> 03:54:40.365]  I appreciate that very much.
[03:54:40.365 --> 03:54:41.946]  Let's take a final call.
[03:54:41.946 --> 03:54:43.967]  Charles in New Hampshire, go ahead.
[03:54:43.967 --> 03:54:46.829]  Yeah, thank you very much for taking my call.
[03:54:46.829 --> 03:55:00.537]  Representative Key, it's just a wonderful surprise and pleasure to know that you're back on the Hill, 47 years of age, and been around, you know, paying attention to these things for quite some time, and I remember you sticking out back in the Oklahoma bombing.
[03:55:01.175 --> 03:55:08.281]  As being one of the few, if not the only one, that was courageous enough to really look into this thing.
[03:55:08.281 --> 03:55:13.525]  And I just can't say how happy I am that you're back, along with Representative Paul.
[03:55:13.525 --> 03:55:29.738]  My inquiry here specifically, because logically and common sense-wise, I remember when they were able to find out about the Ryder truck with supposedly an unscathed VIN number that just happened to miraculously survive this
[03:55:30.234 --> 03:55:32.578]  Huge blast in the rider truck.
[03:55:32.578 --> 03:55:42.553]  It reminds me of 19 box cutters at 9-11 that somehow got through the metal detectors and no one has been able to bring out the box cutters, at least the metal part where it cuts.
[03:55:44.853 --> 03:55:50.336]  And what I understand, in some of the pictures that I've seen, I'm still waiting to see a hole in the ground.
[03:55:50.336 --> 03:55:53.978]  And wasn't the Murray Building a nuclear fallout shelter?
[03:55:53.978 --> 03:55:57.060]  It's just certain things, common sense, don't add up.
[03:55:57.060 --> 03:55:58.801]  Okay, thanks for the call.
[03:55:58.801 --> 03:56:03.283]  Let me get a final comment from Charles Key on that.
[03:56:03.283 --> 03:56:13.109]  Well, you know, there's been a lot of time passed by, so I'm not sure I recall anything like that, but it did have some lower levels in it, and it had a lower
[03:56:14.386 --> 03:56:18.428]  Level parking garage that actually was, I think, two levels deep below the ground level.
[03:56:18.428 --> 03:56:20.929]  I remember the VIN number thing off the car.
[03:56:20.929 --> 03:56:21.689]  Yeah, the VIN number.
[03:56:21.689 --> 03:56:27.852]  I mean, there's a lot of odd things that happen in the Oklahoma City case, and that may be some real good, you know, evidence.
[03:56:27.852 --> 03:56:42.759]  And not that that's not worthy of talking about it when I make my next comment, but the fact is, you know, there's a wealth of information that proves that there were other people involved, that our Justice Department and FBI did not want to go after those people.
[03:56:42.759 --> 03:56:43.779]  They intentionally did not.
[03:56:44.341 --> 03:56:52.284]  And, you know, to close up with back to the Tenth Amendment and the Constitution, we must hold government accountable at every level.
[03:56:52.284 --> 03:56:54.705]  If we don't, things get out of control.
[03:56:54.705 --> 03:57:04.429]  And not only do they take more of your money, more of your privacy, freedom of speech, freedom of assembly, the list goes on, but things like the Oklahoma City bombing can happen.
[03:57:04.429 --> 03:57:05.329]  Absolutely.
[03:57:05.329 --> 03:57:08.311]  Charles Key, I really appreciate you spending time with us.
[03:57:08.311 --> 03:57:10.832]  I want to get you back up in the near future if you'll give us the time.
[03:57:10.832 --> 03:57:11.512]  Thank you for the time.
[03:57:11.912 --> 03:57:13.172]  Thank you for having me.
[03:57:13.172 --> 03:57:13.793]  Bye-bye.
[03:57:13.793 --> 03:57:15.053]  We're out of time, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:57:15.053 --> 03:57:19.314]  I'll be back this Saturday, live, 4 to 6 p.m., and then all next week.

[03:57:32.157 --> 03:57:35.458]  It is the best green food out there, bar none.
[03:57:35.458 --> 03:57:38.319]  I take it every day, a little bit of scoops of orange juice or apple juice.
[03:57:38.943 --> 03:57:39.404]  I think?
[03:57:46.024 --> 03:57:48.206]  Fourteen other superfoods.
[03:57:48.206 --> 03:57:49.727]  Balance energy all day long.
[03:57:49.727 --> 03:57:50.808]  Greater mental clarity.
[03:57:50.808 --> 03:57:52.209]  Reduce food cravings.
