[00:00.000 --> 00:07.900]  government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does he. He's Alex Jones on the
[00:07.900 --> 00:31.980]  GCN Radio Network, and now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:31.980 --> 00:39.180]  The dollar continues its slide. Gold and, of course, other commodities, like oil,
[00:39.180 --> 00:45.980]  aren't exploding. Welcome, ladies and gentlemen. It is Friday, the 27th day of
[00:45.980 --> 00:56.220]  June, 2008. We had Jordan Maxwell on for about two hours and 50 minutes Monday,
[00:56.220 --> 01:00.300]  and listeners really, really enjoyed hearing from him. Thought it was very
[01:00.300 --> 01:05.420]  informative and thought-provoking, so instead of waiting a year or two till the
[01:05.420 --> 01:08.060]  next time we have him back on, as we normally do, we have Jordan on about
[01:08.060 --> 01:12.540]  once a year on average. I thought, why not just go ahead and have Jordan back on
[01:12.540 --> 01:16.300]  today for two hours? The next hour and the hour after that will be all of this.
[01:16.300 --> 01:21.900]  Then, State Rep Charles Key, who's helped expose the fact that Oklahoma City was an
[01:21.900 --> 01:29.260]  inside job, he got passed in the state legislature a clause restating the
[01:29.260 --> 01:32.300]  sovereignty of Oklahoma against the federal government in the New World Order.
[01:32.300 --> 01:40.060]  It passed 90 plus, what was it, 93 to 6? I've got the actual vote here, yeah, 93 to 6.
[01:40.780 --> 01:47.980]  So, he'll be joining us coming up in the final hour today. We'll have open phones
[01:47.980 --> 01:54.620]  with Jordan Maxwell in the second hour with him. First hour, we won't, but in the
[01:54.620 --> 02:01.340]  second hour with Jordan Maxwell, we will have open phones.
[02:02.700 --> 02:05.980]  There's a lot of news here in front of me, a lot of information that we're going
[02:05.980 --> 02:08.700]  to be going over.
[02:09.260 --> 02:15.420]  All of it is extremely important. Every day, the amount of criminal activity by
[02:15.420 --> 02:21.420]  the globalist just increases and the amount of their exposure, the extent to
[02:21.420 --> 02:26.780]  which they are revealed, intensifies.
[02:26.780 --> 02:31.660]  Credit crunch forcing U.S. middle classes to live in their cars.
[02:31.660 --> 02:37.420]  Wall Street plunges towards worse month since the Great Depression.
[02:37.420 --> 02:45.980]  OPEC chief sees oil at $150 to $170 a barrel in the coming months.
[02:45.980 --> 02:53.580]  I'm going to cover this when we get back, but I was tuned in to two different radio shows this morning.
[02:53.580 --> 03:00.220]  One driving over to the office and another one that was on in the office, mainstream radio.
[03:00.220 --> 03:04.700]  And I heard three separate callers,
[03:05.420 --> 03:10.140]  two callers driving in and then a caller in the office just about 10 minutes
[03:10.140 --> 03:17.660]  before I went on air on another show saying that
[03:17.660 --> 03:25.740]  they are very upset with how, well in the last case, the local station, at least
[03:25.740 --> 03:31.260]  for a time, I guess I'm on at 590 a.m., has taken Neil Boards off and has put a
[03:31.260 --> 03:35.340]  local show on, which is fine and dandy. I'm not getting in the middle of that.
[03:35.340 --> 03:41.180]  The point is the woman was saying, oh, I think it's so great that you're not talking about
[03:41.180 --> 03:47.660]  serious subjects. I'm tired of hearing all the bad news. Oh, I'm so glad you've taken him off the air.
[03:48.940 --> 03:53.900]  I think they're just testing a local bunch in there and they're literally talking about stuff
[03:53.900 --> 03:58.460]  like how old should a girl be when she wears makeup? What is your favorite color?
[03:58.460 --> 04:05.580]  How many tickets they got when they were teenagers? Just total puff head.
[04:07.100 --> 04:11.020]  And I was thinking, you know, maybe they don't know what they're doing over there,
[04:11.020 --> 04:15.980]  putting stuff like that on, but maybe they do because that's what I guess the people want.
[04:18.060 --> 04:22.140]  Because I was listening to another syndicated show and heard two callers say the same thing,
[04:22.140 --> 04:29.500]  hey, I wish you wouldn't be so negative. I wish you wouldn't talk about so much negative stuff.
[04:31.100 --> 04:36.380]  You should just choose to say everything's positive. So I want to speak to this mindset.
[04:37.260 --> 04:41.100]  When we get back, it is the mindset that's gotten us where we are.
[04:42.860 --> 04:46.460]  I'm negative about a lot of bad things that are happening because I want them to stop.
[04:46.460 --> 04:52.060]  Okay, we'll be right back.
[05:30.140 --> 05:34.780]  Thousands of special video reports from tainted vaccines to martial law can be found in this

[07:52.060 --> 08:05.180]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does he.
[08:05.900 --> 08:14.140]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network and now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[08:14.140 --> 08:21.260]  So I'm listening to a couple of our talk radio stations this morning
[08:22.460 --> 08:27.340]  and the callers are calling in, even though it's not on topic, saying we don't want to hear about
[08:27.340 --> 08:32.140]  bad things. We don't want to hear about old prices going up. We don't want to hear about
[08:33.500 --> 08:38.860]  potential war with Iran. We don't want to hear negative things. And last night I was scanning
[08:38.860 --> 08:44.700]  around on YouTube, as I always do, and saw a video posted by a young man who said,
[08:44.700 --> 08:51.020]  I listened to Alex for a couple of years and then I just got really depressed and I realized he's
[08:51.020 --> 08:56.220]  just a fearmonger and I choose not to believe his worldview and what he's saying.
[08:59.900 --> 09:04.540]  And that was basically the nature of it. And he also criticized me because we have sponsors.
[09:04.540 --> 09:09.500]  That our stations that we're on have to have sponsors too. And then the network has to
[09:09.500 --> 09:14.860]  have sponsors and I do too. This doesn't happen for free, folks. But again, that's the child
[09:14.860 --> 09:22.380]  likeness of the American people. No connection to reality. And they believe that if they say
[09:24.140 --> 09:27.660]  something isn't true or ignore it, that it will make it be so.
[09:29.260 --> 09:33.900]  Now let's be clear here. I am fighting the New World Order. I am criticizing and trying
[09:33.900 --> 09:41.740]  to expose corruption because I want to save what's left and try to rehabilitate what's been taken
[09:41.740 --> 09:48.380]  over of our free society. We have all these thousands of government documents and think tanks
[09:48.380 --> 09:52.860]  and their own announcements about how they want to have a total control grid and putting in scanners
[09:52.860 --> 09:57.180]  that show your naked body at the airports and children being trained to tattle on their parents
[09:57.180 --> 10:00.460]  and you can't hug or kiss your children or you'll be arrested. That's now going to be
[10:00.460 --> 10:04.060]  pedophilia in England and the U.S. so the state can take control of your lives.
[10:05.420 --> 10:09.500]  And the government is involved in all of these pedophile crimes and all these different homeland
[10:09.500 --> 10:12.940]  security deputy heads have gone to jail for it because local police bust them.
[10:15.580 --> 10:19.900]  And the Dine Corps and Halliburton do run child kidnapping rings and that's mainstream news.
[10:19.900 --> 10:24.220]  They don't get in trouble. I mean, I'm not supposed to expose that. I'm not supposed to talk about
[10:24.220 --> 10:34.540]  how our dollars plunging in value more than a cent a month. There's not many cents left that it can
[10:34.540 --> 10:45.020]  lose. You know what that means? There's the Eau Clochet, the canard of the denial is not a river
[10:45.020 --> 10:55.900]  in North Africa. This is denial. If we do not admit how bad things are, if we do not admit
[10:55.900 --> 11:00.220]  how serious things are, if we do not admit how dire our
[11:02.380 --> 11:09.340]  straits are, then the evil is going to win, ladies and gentlemen. We cannot live in denial.
[11:09.340 --> 11:13.180]  There's this idea that you can just be optimistic about things and that's certainly true in business
[11:13.180 --> 11:18.780]  and life and when you're in college trying to get a date to be optimistic, to be positive,
[11:18.780 --> 11:23.580]  to not just act like you're confident, but to really be confident. And it's certainly
[11:23.580 --> 11:28.460]  good if you're selling people cars or it's good if things like that are at a cocktail party,
[11:28.460 --> 11:36.060]  but it only goes so far. And just, oh, Alex, be positive things aren't that bad. Hey, I wish
[11:36.060 --> 11:42.460]  that I sometimes didn't know 10 years ago that Dincor, Halliburton,
[11:44.300 --> 11:48.780]  the United Nations were running giant child kidnapping rinks. And I would even try to deny
[11:48.780 --> 11:53.020]  it when I'd see it in foreign newspapers and foreign investigations and lawsuits and people
[11:53.020 --> 11:58.460]  going to jail for it overseas. And then it came out in major papers in the US the last four years
[11:58.460 --> 12:06.700]  and was admitted and it was worse than I thought and even brave two governors went public about it
[12:09.580 --> 12:17.580]  and nothing happened. I mean, you better believe every day I wish that wasn't true because that's
[12:17.580 --> 12:24.220]  scary folks to know that people running our government are as evil as it gets. Here's another
[12:24.220 --> 12:29.580]  example. State police guy called in the Midwest yesterday and he said, you know, Alex, I didn't
[12:29.580 --> 12:33.340]  believe you about a lot of this stuff, but now they're getting us ready for federalization
[12:33.340 --> 12:37.340]  training is that we've got to do what the president says in emergencies and putting us
[12:37.340 --> 12:41.420]  through these drills and but see, I didn't have to believe that he was state police. I don't have
[12:41.420 --> 12:45.340]  to believe him even though he sounded credible. I already know it's in the John Warner Defense
[12:45.340 --> 12:49.500]  Authorization Act. I already know it's in the military commissions act. I already know it's
[12:49.500 --> 12:55.100]  in PDD 51. I've had the Congress been on to talk about it. I've played clips of them debating
[12:55.100 --> 12:59.580]  on the House floor. Congress isn't allowed to see it. You're going, well, wait a minute. You said
[12:59.580 --> 13:05.420]  you know it's in it. Just the two page cover sheet says the president is a dictator for any
[13:05.420 --> 13:11.420]  emergency, any emergency, including economic or anything they say is an emergency that the governors
[13:11.420 --> 13:17.420]  are vassals, the state guards, the national guards, the police. The Congress has no authority
[13:17.420 --> 13:21.180]  and Congress said we like to see that full report, that full plan and the White House said you're
[13:21.180 --> 13:26.700]  not allowed to. The highest cleared as high as the president, Homeland Security Committee can't see
[13:26.700 --> 13:34.460]  it. And then they went on the floor and freaked out over it. Now it just so happens they've been
[13:34.460 --> 13:37.980]  expanding this through the executive for decades and I've interviewed Thomas Sanchez, head of
[13:37.980 --> 13:41.820]  emergency management in Kingsville and the chief of police in San Antonio, Ali Philippus of the
[13:41.820 --> 13:46.460]  time and a bunch of other people and we learned in briefings what they were given. It's gun
[13:46.460 --> 13:50.940]  confiscation, it's mass arrests, it's forced inoculations. Now I told you that 10 years ago,
[13:50.940 --> 13:56.860]  11 years ago, now it's in the news. Now I can play you newscast where they're saying yes,
[13:56.860 --> 14:01.980]  we built camps for you. Yes, we've trained preachers to tell you to go to camps. Yes,
[14:01.980 --> 14:06.940]  we're going to forcibly inoculate you. Yes, we're federalizing. Yes, the president's a dictator.
[14:07.900 --> 14:14.060]  Yes. And that means Obama or whoever else comes after him, even if you love George Bush.
[14:14.060 --> 14:20.860]  Don't you understand, we had conventions and rules and laws and still do against that for a reason
[14:23.340 --> 14:29.100]  that powerful, intelligent people throughout history, powerful elites have always tried to
[14:29.100 --> 14:33.420]  get control of governments. Why? Because then you've got the money machines. You've got the
[14:33.420 --> 14:37.740]  military. You've got the power. These are people on power trips. They want power. You know, everybody
[14:37.740 --> 14:43.180]  wants to rule the world. That's just common sense. Everybody knows that or at least they should,
[14:43.180 --> 14:46.700]  but according to some people, they taught us the last 80 years in this nation,
[14:46.700 --> 14:50.620]  nobody wants to rule the world. There's no elites. There's no powerful interest.
[14:52.380 --> 15:02.060]  And I watched this poor young man who thinks I'm the bad guy on YouTube because I get up here and
[15:02.060 --> 15:11.580]  yell and scream about what's happening. Folks, I'm thinking about doing a middle of the night live
[15:11.580 --> 15:17.580]  stream on prisonplanet.tv. People don't believe it that I now wake up almost every night for hours
[15:17.580 --> 15:22.220]  and can't sleep worried about this. I've always been somebody that sleeps like the dead. I woke
[15:22.220 --> 15:30.380]  up at 1.44 last night, been asleep a few hours, no coffee, no nothing. And I laid there in bed in
[15:30.380 --> 15:36.140]  the cool of the night, looking at the shadows on the walls through the window, just thinking about
[15:36.140 --> 15:40.140]  all of this. I thought, why don't I just have a computer by my bed and I'll just start firing it
[15:40.140 --> 15:53.820]  up and going live at 3am, 4am, 2am? Just laying there. I mean, I'm sorry if I can't sleep over this.
[15:55.340 --> 16:03.100]  When you find out that there is a giant industrial, I mean, that means huge, mechanized,
[16:03.100 --> 16:11.500]  oiled with a bureaucracy for kidnapping women and children. When you realize that the government
[16:11.500 --> 16:16.780]  does control the importation of narcotics, when you realize that they do launder the money in
[16:16.780 --> 16:22.140]  their banks, when you realize they are following every form of tyranny, what are you supposed to
[16:22.140 --> 16:27.340]  do? And I hear the poor public saying, we don't want to hear this. I mean, even fake neocon stuff,
[16:27.340 --> 16:32.060]  they don't want to hear about the borders are being overrun and how the, you know, blame,
[16:32.060 --> 16:37.180]  they don't want to hear the false alarmism about the Democrats. No difference, makes no,
[16:37.180 --> 16:45.740]  it's pointless to debate these characters. So, I don't know what I can do for people
[16:46.780 --> 16:50.460]  like that who are living in such denial. I mean, look at these reports I've got.
[16:51.660 --> 16:53.980]  This is in Alex Jones five years ago,
[16:53.980 --> 17:01.580]  because we could see five, six, seven, eight years ago, the Federal Reserve printing money
[17:01.580 --> 17:06.140]  so fast it was going out of style, giving everybody credit, the real assets were being
[17:06.140 --> 17:12.620]  snatched up. Then we read the IMF and World Bank documents in 2002, where they were planning the
[17:12.620 --> 17:30.380]  whole thing. Just amazing. Absolutely amazing. And now I have the headlines
[17:33.020 --> 17:33.820]  here in front of me.
[17:33.820 --> 17:40.700]  Wall Street plunges towards worst month since the Great Depression.
[17:44.460 --> 17:51.340]  There's another one, AP oil reaches $142 a barrel on view dollar will keep falling.
[17:51.980 --> 17:56.700]  Did you hear that? Now you'll see this in Reuters and AP news wires and you might hear it once a
[17:56.700 --> 18:04.380]  month on some talk show on MSNBC or CNBC, but I'm at the grocery store, I'm at church, I'm
[18:04.380 --> 18:09.420]  deep-sea fishing last week with my son, and I'm talking to businessmen and people and they don't
[18:09.420 --> 18:13.260]  know I'm going, the dollar's been devalued and they're like, no, it hadn't, I got money in the
[18:13.260 --> 18:17.740]  bank, I got a piece of land, I got a, I got a business and my money isn't devalued. I'm like,
[18:17.740 --> 18:24.300]  yeah, it is. And they think they can just say, no, it's not devalued and that it changes it.
[18:24.300 --> 18:31.660]  But oh, you're an alarmist, I, and a lot of people in the population think that if you're
[18:31.660 --> 18:37.100]  talking to them, that if you're telling them about bad things that are happening, you're like a
[18:37.100 --> 18:44.460]  showoff, you're doing this to act smart. Somehow they inculcated the population with that view.
[18:44.460 --> 18:48.300]  Man, I'm just trying to get you to wake up hoping together we can put political pressure
[18:48.300 --> 18:52.380]  on the establishment to stop the absolute sacking and gutting of this country forever.
[18:52.380 --> 18:59.180]  Here's another fear mongering issue I try to put out every day. I mean, sodium fluoride does attack
[18:59.180 --> 19:02.540]  your brain and glands and every organ and does hurt you and there's thousands of government
[19:02.540 --> 19:06.620]  and institution and university studies and there's no debating and you can go look them up yourself
[19:06.620 --> 19:11.260]  and I've had neurologist and scientist and everybody else on to cover it and read all the
[19:11.260 --> 19:16.620]  studies and I mean, it's there. You can say it isn't true and slurp your fluoride, but I mean,
[19:17.340 --> 19:20.700]  you can say first they said there wasn't mercury in the shots and they said it was there and good
[19:20.700 --> 19:26.220]  for you. Now they admit it's hurt millions of people. What do they do? They increase it by
[19:26.220 --> 19:32.700]  five times in the shots. I mean, not knowing what's going on will get you hurt real bad.
[19:35.180 --> 19:39.580]  We'll come back and get into Wall Street plunges towards worse months since great
[19:39.580 --> 19:45.020]  depression on early 1930s. Oil reaches $142. A few dollars will keep falling.
[19:45.020 --> 19:49.820]  Just, you can say I'm lying, but I mean, I'm just covering what's happening.
[19:53.340 --> 19:59.180]  Hi, neighbor. This is Steve Shank, Fearless Task Force. Life is a gamble, but you can stack the deck.
[19:59.980 --> 20:04.940]  If you knew what I know about all the problems food will protect you from, you'd start immediately
[20:04.940 --> 20:10.620]  to put every effort and dollar you can get into the biggest supply of food possible. When the dollar
[20:10.620 --> 20:16.780]  and economy crash, when the imported and genetically poisoned food is all that's left, when the quarantine
[20:16.780 --> 20:22.380]  and bird flu hit, our only protection and only chance to be fearless is having control of our
[20:22.380 --> 20:27.020]  own supply of food and enough of it. But if you knew what we haven't yet discovered, you wouldn't
[20:27.020 --> 20:31.740]  waste time listening to the rest of this announcement before charging out and getting a serious food
[20:31.740 --> 20:39.020]  supply. Decide it's food now or probably never, but can you afford to be wrong? Decide now.
[20:39.020 --> 20:47.740]  Place your bet. Can you afford to be wrong? Call 800-409-5633 on the web eFoodsDirect.com.
[20:48.300 --> 20:51.100]  Call 800-409-5633.
[20:53.660 --> 21:01.660]  It is a big idea. A new world order. In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful
[21:01.660 --> 21:13.420]  world government. For thousands of years, their dark order grew. Now as they hail the birth of
[21:13.420 --> 21:19.020]  the new world order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[21:21.900 --> 21:27.420]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[21:27.420 --> 21:31.180]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire new world order agenda.
[21:31.180 --> 21:35.020]  Bill Bergus is making great progress for the world government. Most people have no idea.
[21:35.020 --> 21:38.380]  They're not after money. They have all the money they need. They're after power. That's their

[21:52.460 --> 21:57.740]  You ever have one of those days where everything goes right? First, I get the best parking space
[21:57.740 --> 22:03.740]  at work. Tonight, I have a date with a very lovely Rachel, and today I gave a killer presentation
[22:03.740 --> 22:09.180]  in Sydney, finalized the contract in London, and demoed our new product in Boston, online
[22:09.180 --> 22:14.380]  from my desk with WebEx. WebEx lets me take meetings and give presentations from my desk.
[22:14.380 --> 22:18.540]  I just talk to clients on the phone, and they watch what's happening on my desktop from their
[22:18.540 --> 22:23.020]  desktop so I can travel the world and still be here for my date tonight with Rachel.

[24:24.940 --> 24:37.740]  But we're not supposed to talk about that. Well, people stopped getting offended by
[24:37.740 --> 24:49.820]  cops bossing them around. I mean, we began to just listen to all the lies, accept cameras on
[24:49.820 --> 24:55.820]  every corner, accept open borders, accept corruption. We stopped looking into things.
[24:55.820 --> 25:00.700]  We just said, hey, life's good. Everything's fine. And a bunch of powerful interests came in here
[25:00.700 --> 25:06.540]  and they set up regional boards. They recruited the establishment, the bankers, the media heads.
[25:06.540 --> 25:10.940]  They all share power with each other. They intensify their power. And a couple thousand people,
[25:10.940 --> 25:15.260]  as the Washington Post reports, the super class, are taking this country down.
[25:15.260 --> 25:17.900]  It isn't enough for them to have trillions of dollars. It isn't enough for them to have
[25:17.900 --> 25:24.220]  incredible power. They want it all. They want to use this as a war machine to invade other countries.
[25:24.780 --> 25:30.060]  They are capturing the United States because politically, the people don't want to be a
[25:30.060 --> 25:37.020]  imperial war engine. Who said that? Zbigniew Brzezinski in his last two books. One published 2007.
[25:37.020 --> 25:43.260]  One published 1998. Grand Chesport, one of them. He said we need terror attacks to get them to go
[25:43.260 --> 25:48.220]  along with us. We need to have huge events, catastrophic large numbers of dead citizens
[25:48.220 --> 25:54.620]  to unify them around a war for world government. Who else says that? The PNAC documents written
[25:54.620 --> 25:58.780]  by Dick Cheney. Who else says that? Syndicated columnist and internal White House memos and
[25:58.780 --> 26:05.340]  Republican national conference memos. National committee memos and state memos. And now McCain's
[26:05.340 --> 26:10.300]  advisor comes out Monday and says, another terror attack would sure help us. People say,
[26:10.300 --> 26:14.460]  why would the government stage an attack? Why would this cabal stage an attack? They're telling
[26:14.460 --> 26:21.020]  you they get power and control out of it. And I'm telling you, whether it's McCain or Obama
[26:21.020 --> 26:26.940]  that gets into office, you're going to have an inaugural bombing. You're going to have a big
[26:26.940 --> 26:34.620]  event, folks. It could be a cratered city, a third of Chicago gone or Dallas or New York or Los Angeles
[26:34.620 --> 26:42.380]  or San Francisco. They've got to bring you to heal and they will do it. They're ruthless. That's
[26:42.380 --> 26:46.540]  why they're in control. Do you know what it means, yuppies, when you keep laughing and saying the
[26:46.540 --> 26:51.740]  dollar isn't devalued? That means your savings, your stocks, everything is being devalued that's
[26:51.740 --> 26:57.260]  denominated in dollars. That means everybody else who you're in business with is being hurt by this.
[26:57.260 --> 27:02.700]  That means all the cost of basically everything we buy and sell are massively increased because
[27:02.700 --> 27:09.580]  of dollar devaluation. Do you understand what that means? And I've been saying for the last
[27:09.580 --> 27:13.900]  seven years since they started devaluing the dollar that it was a red level crisis and you
[27:13.900 --> 27:18.700]  laugh and you still laugh and say, I am a fair monger. Well, you know what? It's pretty much
[27:18.700 --> 27:24.060]  too late now and it's not my fault what's happened and I did the best I could to warn you and what
[27:24.060 --> 27:29.340]  did I get for it? I got hated for it. You want somebody to lie to you? There's plenty of them
[27:29.340 --> 27:35.820]  to do that. Go find them. Go have them tell you everything's wonderful. That's like if your pipes
[27:35.820 --> 27:38.940]  have busted and you're walking around your house while you're in two feet of water and it's ruining
[27:38.940 --> 27:45.100]  your furniture and carpet and everything else and grandma's watercolors on the wall are getting
[27:45.100 --> 27:50.860]  ruined and you go negative. There's no water in here. I choose to be positive and I'm not going
[27:50.860 --> 27:54.700]  to fear monger. Instead of getting the pipes fixed, getting the water turned off at the street,
[27:56.140 --> 27:59.500]  you'll let it run out in the street and ruin your house and let the floor cave in and the
[27:59.500 --> 28:05.260]  ceiling cave in. I mean that literally that's what you do. I don't understand it and then I'm bad.
[28:07.340 --> 28:14.620]  I can't properly express how bad it is. Okay, you understand? The human chimpanzee crosses,
[28:14.620 --> 28:21.660]  they declassified. They had five years ago. Human bovine, human spider, human rat. This
[28:21.660 --> 28:29.340]  isn't funny. Not just for humanity and what it means but the fact of the mega viruses by crossing
[28:29.340 --> 28:36.860]  different zoological creatures with almost sapien sapien. Oil reaches $142 on viewed dollar will
[28:36.860 --> 28:42.860]  keep falling. Oil futures climb briefly to a new record above $142 a barrel Friday on expectations
[28:42.860 --> 28:48.780]  that the weakening dollar, a major factor in crude stratospheric rise will expand its decline and
[28:48.780 --> 28:56.220]  add to oil's appeal. And then it says here, that's the AP. Here's the UK Daily Mail. How dare them
[28:56.220 --> 29:01.180]  fear monger? They're just now having to admit to you what's happening and that means they've
[29:01.180 --> 29:05.500]  decided to give up the ghost as Bob Chapman said. Usually they just lie about all this. Oh my god,
[29:05.500 --> 29:10.860]  this is bad. I mean the fact that this is all over at least the news wires on our news. You know,
[29:10.860 --> 29:14.780]  they don't tell the drooling slaves this but people who actually read news wires they're telling us.
[29:15.660 --> 29:20.940]  Wall Street plunges towards worse months since the Great Depression on early 1930s. I'm going to
[29:20.940 --> 29:27.020]  cover this when we get back. And I'm totally freaked out. You understand how leveraged into debt
[29:27.020 --> 29:33.420]  we are. You realize what's going to happen. War in the streets. This will make 1933 look like
[29:33.420 --> 29:40.780]  choir practice, my god. And you think it's funny, yuppies. It isn't funny.
[29:43.900 --> 29:50.620]  We're on the march. The empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[29:53.900 --> 29:59.260]  Terror Storm, a history of government-sponsored terror, loose change, final cut, in-game blueprint
[29:59.260 --> 30:04.380]  for global enslavement, the true story of the Bilderberg group, the late great USA, America,

[33:15.180 --> 33:25.340]  gotta cut you down. Sooner or later, gotta cut you down. Go tell that long-tongue liar. Go and tell
[33:25.340 --> 33:32.780]  that midnight writer. Tell the rambler, the gambler, the backbiter. Tell him that God's gonna
[33:32.780 --> 33:39.740]  cut him down. Tell him that God's gonna cut him down. We're back live, ladies and gentlemen.
[33:41.500 --> 33:46.780]  Well, my goodness, traces, let me tell you the news. It is Friday. I've been with with the midnight
[33:46.780 --> 34:03.580]  dude. 27th of June, 2008. Jordan Maxwell joins us next hour, live on this Friday. Then state rep
[34:03.580 --> 34:09.020]  Charles Key, no, he's not exposing Oklahoma City as an inside job. He'll be doing that too for an hour.
[34:11.260 --> 34:13.900]  He is going to be on the show to talk about how they've passed a law
[34:13.900 --> 34:18.300]  to secede from the New World Order because that's now what the federal government is.
[34:18.300 --> 34:23.820]  We'll tell you about that coming up. It is big news. 90 plus percent of the legislature
[34:24.700 --> 34:28.140]  went to pass that. Finishing up with this important news story,
[34:28.780 --> 34:35.020]  Wall Street plunges towards worse month since the Great Depression on the early 1930s.
[34:35.580 --> 34:40.620]  This is how 1930s started. It started with about a year of the markets racing up and down, up and
[34:40.620 --> 34:47.660]  down, up and down. And with the credit crisis, which the private banks created, and that's now
[34:47.660 --> 34:51.420]  been admitted and their own documents have been released, that they organized it. They had to
[34:51.420 --> 34:56.860]  bring everything down to nothing to buy up most of the country. This is another shearing to the bone.
[34:57.580 --> 35:02.380]  Shares plunged on both sides of the Atlantic yesterday because of fears over oil, inflation,
[35:02.380 --> 35:11.580]  the global economy, inflation in every commodity. Corn, wheat, oil, natural gas, silver, gold,
[35:12.460 --> 35:22.060]  copper, palladium. In London, the FTSE 100 slump 2.6 percent are 147.9 points to 5518.2.
[35:22.060 --> 35:27.100]  Meanwhile, in America, the Dow Jones fell more than 350 points to its lowest level since
[35:27.100 --> 35:31.900]  October 1, 2006. It is now, of course, be the worst June performance since the Great Depression
[35:31.900 --> 35:42.620]  in the early 1930s. And it goes on, so they're panicking. I don't know if it's going to implode
[35:42.620 --> 35:49.740]  this year, next year, two years from now. The point is that the fundamentals have never been this bad
[35:49.740 --> 35:56.780]  with the amount of leverage debt, the amount of derivatives. It's over $600 trillion. It is insane.
[35:56.780 --> 36:03.180]  And all the big boys are buying mountain of doubts with private security firms and getting out of
[36:03.180 --> 36:07.740]  the country, getting out of Israel. I don't ask yourselves why. I don't know, getting out of
[36:07.740 --> 36:15.180]  the U.S., getting out of Israel. They are... God knows what they're going to do to this country.
[36:16.380 --> 36:23.100]  Maybe this won't happen. Maybe it'll pull out. But the chances are it's going to be very,
[36:23.100 --> 36:27.100]  very bad. How bad it is is the question. I mean, it's already bad. And this is only the
[36:27.660 --> 36:31.820]  leading edge of a storm that gets much more intense. I wanted to bring Steve Shankon,
[36:31.820 --> 36:35.820]  because he had been on this in about a month. And Steve is the oldest continually operating
[36:35.820 --> 36:39.660]  storeable foods company in the nation. And he's a great guy. I've gotten food from him now. What
[36:39.660 --> 36:44.620]  is it? Four or five times. And then I get it and give it to family. I keep some for myself. And it
[36:44.620 --> 36:48.220]  isn't because I'm living in fear. It's because I'm living in a greater level of control than
[36:48.220 --> 36:52.540]  general public. If everything goes to hell in a handbasket, I've got a couple of year food supply.
[36:52.540 --> 36:59.180]  And millions went hungry. It was just a university study last month showing that eight million people
[36:59.180 --> 37:04.300]  starved to death. And then they got sick. And then that was marked on their death certificate.
[37:04.300 --> 37:08.540]  Because when they got... Both people who died in Africa, it's not starvation. It's just they
[37:08.540 --> 37:15.100]  get real weak. And then something kills them. Eight million people can pull that up. But the
[37:15.100 --> 37:19.180]  point is, I'm not saying any of that's going to happen. It's just that I have a responsibility.
[37:19.180 --> 37:25.580]  Some paper insurance policy can go up in smoke. But storeable food is something that won't and
[37:25.580 --> 37:31.420]  something I've got. Steve, thanks for coming on with us. It's good to be with you, Alex, again.
[37:32.060 --> 37:37.820]  And it's interesting that you commented on how bad Wall Street is right now. This is only the end
[37:37.820 --> 37:44.860]  of June. All of the problems that we were expecting back at the beginning of the year, Alex,
[37:44.860 --> 37:52.540]  we were expecting to hit heavy duty in September. We are a full three months ahead of schedule
[37:53.580 --> 37:58.860]  in terms of those of us that were tracking this. And I know that you're right at the
[37:58.860 --> 38:04.220]  leading edge of that. You've done a masterful job of tracking what's happening in the country.
[38:04.780 --> 38:14.620]  And the fact is, you mentioned what's going on with the gasoline and the
[38:14.620 --> 38:20.220]  fuel issues. Right now, in the rest of the world, they're screaming nothing. They're not even talking
[38:20.220 --> 38:27.180]  about gas. They're talking about food, food, food, food, food. Right here in our country,
[38:27.180 --> 38:33.740]  what we've got, all of your listeners know that gas prices are just absolutely going nuts.
[38:33.740 --> 38:38.620]  And there is no end in sight. And the crop was bad because of a lot of rain that flooded the
[38:38.620 --> 38:42.780]  Midwest last year. Now it happened again. I wanted to ask you, does that intensify things?
[38:42.780 --> 38:51.180]  Oh, immeasurably, I flew from Florida to Chicago a day before yesterday. And for an hour and a
[38:51.180 --> 38:57.420]  half at roughly, what, 300 and some odd miles an hour, I was looking down at nothing but a great
[38:57.420 --> 39:03.260]  big ocean that had a few islands in it. It is absolutely huge. They say over five million acres
[39:03.820 --> 39:12.060]  and the main corn crop areas. And here's the, here's the, you are used to exposing really dumb
[39:12.060 --> 39:19.420]  things, but we've got to give the dumber than a box of rocks award to the EPA and the US Department
[39:19.420 --> 39:26.540]  of Agriculture because right now they are debating whether to allow farmers to pay $75 an acre to
[39:26.540 --> 39:33.340]  put land back into production. And they're doing that on June 22nd. They started that,
[39:33.340 --> 39:38.540]  which means that even if they do put that land into production, they will not get a crop this year.
[39:38.540 --> 39:44.860]  And one of the things that we're finding out, remember, you and I have talked about China
[39:45.420 --> 39:49.900]  and many of us have wondered what they're going to do with that $1.3 trillion that
[39:49.900 --> 39:56.060]  they have. Well, now we know, they are going around the world buying land and they are going
[39:56.060 --> 40:02.940]  around the world buying food at four times the ask price right now. They're buying futures
[40:02.940 --> 40:08.780]  at four times the ask price right now. They've got the money to do it and that means that there
[40:08.780 --> 40:15.180]  is going to be no food very soon. Now, with regard to the gas prices, what happens when
[40:15.180 --> 40:19.980]  you run out of money and you can't afford the gas, you can park your car and you can stop traveling,
[40:19.980 --> 40:25.580]  that is happening, Alex. That is happening. Are you kidding? I mean, I see five times as many
[40:25.580 --> 40:30.700]  moped's and motorcycles now out on the roads, buzzing around like wasps everywhere, little
[40:30.700 --> 40:35.340]  vespas and things and people I know are selling their cars, even small cars, and getting them.
[40:36.780 --> 40:40.060]  Again, a lot of people who are well off say, oh, I don't care. Well, that's going to affect your
[40:40.060 --> 40:46.300]  business. In fact, here is the UK Daily Mail. The scared mood on the trading floors came amid fears
[40:46.300 --> 40:50.140]  that soaring energy prices will push up inflation and the road consumer spending
[40:50.140 --> 40:55.100]  dramatically reducing company profits. You see, this goes across all lines.
[40:55.100 --> 41:02.700]  Yeah, it does. But the problem is that what happens if you run out of gas, you don't travel.
[41:04.140 --> 41:11.020]  If you run out of food, which is the subject that nobody is talking about that that much
[41:11.020 --> 41:16.300]  in the country. However, all the investors, all of the money, Alex, is going into food.
[41:16.300 --> 41:21.740]  They're buying up food like crazy. They're buying up farmland. They're buying up equipment.
[41:21.740 --> 41:27.660]  They're doing everything they can because the investors know that the real issue is not gas,
[41:27.660 --> 41:34.540]  not fuel. The real issue is food. Because you see, if you can't afford the food, as many Americans
[41:34.540 --> 41:39.820]  already with the inflation that we've had already, Alex, many Americans, we're getting emails all
[41:39.820 --> 41:45.900]  the time at eFoodsDirect.com that are telling us, hey, we can't afford food now. How are we supposed
[41:45.900 --> 41:50.540]  to put in food ahead? So we've made some adjustments in what we're telling folks.
[41:50.540 --> 41:56.060]  It used to be, up until a few weeks ago, that we said, what you need to do is set aside some money.
[41:56.060 --> 42:00.140]  And we did some calculations. You know that food that you got from eFoodsDirect?
[42:01.900 --> 42:10.060]  We calculated what's going on. Do you realize, Alex, that families can get this year's food
[42:10.060 --> 42:17.740]  at half the cost of last year's groceries right now? If they buy bulk food, which by the way,
[42:17.740 --> 42:24.700]  it turns out it's superfood. We've done some comparisons on the one-year supplies, and particularly
[42:24.700 --> 42:30.860]  this two-month grab-and-go thing, which I really need to tell you about. But this stuff is actually
[42:30.860 --> 42:37.820]  superfood. It's got big taste. It's extremely healthy. It's extremely easy to fix. And the cost,
[42:37.820 --> 42:44.300]  like I say, is running at half the cost of last year's groceries. Well, I would just add that
[42:44.300 --> 42:50.700]  because it's freeze-dried or dehydrated, it also fits in very small cans compared to the amount
[42:50.700 --> 42:56.060]  that it would be in store-bought stuff. So it's also very, very portable. And that's important as well.
[42:57.180 --> 43:02.940]  Well, it really is. And the thing that I needed to mention, and you and I haven't talked that
[43:02.940 --> 43:09.020]  much about it, but we've got hurricane season coming up. And right now, with all the weird
[43:09.020 --> 43:15.580]  weather worldwide, people can't help but notice this, with all of the weird conditions with
[43:15.580 --> 43:21.820]  transportation, with the threat of possibly quarantines, with all of the stuff we've got
[43:21.820 --> 43:27.420]  coming at us, this little, what I'd like to have all of your listeners to do is get up on
[43:27.420 --> 43:35.420]  eFoodsDirect.com and take a look at the two-month grab-and-go kit. This is 200 meals. And literally
[43:35.420 --> 43:39.900]  what we've got right now, Roger, with the high price of food, we've got a lot of families
[43:40.540 --> 43:45.740]  that are actually eating this right now because they can put in top quality meals,
[43:45.740 --> 43:53.740]  extremely nutritious stuff at half the cost of last year's groceries. So one of these packs that
[43:53.740 --> 44:00.380]  feeds a person two months, three good square meals a day plus an additional 20 meals,
[44:00.380 --> 44:05.660]  is going to cost them about $5.25 a day. Homeless people can't get by on that.
[44:06.540 --> 44:10.780]  And well, that's what they get by going to you, you know, the folks that actually get the food
[44:10.780 --> 44:15.180]  and prepare it and put it in the cans. Give them the phone number if they also want to call. A lot
[44:15.180 --> 44:20.220]  of my listeners, probably 30%, aren't on the internet, or a lot of others would rather just
[44:20.220 --> 44:23.180]  call. How do they call eFoodsDirect? The J. Michael Stevens group.
[44:23.180 --> 44:36.300]  Just go 800-409-5633. That's 800-409-5633. And the main thing that every family should have
[44:36.860 --> 44:42.220]  in their trunk, these little two month grab-and-go things, they come in two cases.
[44:42.940 --> 44:47.100]  The meals are already there. The quick fix. Yeah, it's two white boxes. A lot of folks in
[44:47.100 --> 44:51.260]  the office have gotten that. We've got a few of those here at the office. Just to have here,
[44:51.260 --> 44:55.340]  it's something I really believe in, and it's a great deal. Again, eFoodsDirect,
[44:55.340 --> 44:59.820]  there's big banners up on infowars.com and prismplanet.com. I really can't miss it.
[44:59.820 --> 45:05.660]  eFoodsDirect.com, eFoodsDirect.com, just an E, and then foodsdirect.com.
[45:06.220 --> 45:08.780]  And given that number again, Steve, I want people to call the number.
[45:08.780 --> 45:23.900]  It's 800-409-5633. Anybody that is in the way of this potential storm area,
[45:23.900 --> 45:29.660]  we're into the hurricane season. Anybody, or hey, the people in the middle of this country, Alex,
[45:30.860 --> 45:36.940]  who did talk to three months ago and said, hey, you probably need some sort of an emergency
[45:36.940 --> 45:43.480]  see evacuation kit or something that you can live on for a couple months until a disaster
[45:43.480 --> 45:47.020]  disappears. They thought we were half a bubble off with one or in the water.
[45:47.020 --> 45:51.020]  Well, here's the deal. The feds have spent billions, and I mean billions the last seven
[45:51.020 --> 45:56.060]  years, six and a half years putting huge billboards up saying get ready, have a five-day food
[45:56.060 --> 46:01.300]  supply. They're just doing that so they can claim they warned us. They know they're messing
[46:01.300 --> 46:04.220]  with the weather, and I've had the father weather weapons on. They are messing with
[46:04.220 --> 46:09.020]  the folks with antennas and with spring, and they now admit that they've been doing it,
[46:09.020 --> 46:15.300]  but they say it's for own good. They're involved in just all sorts of behavior. But look, Steve,
[46:15.300 --> 46:20.100]  my main reason for having horrible food is the economics. I mean, I know that there is
[46:20.100 --> 46:24.740]  a food shortage worldwide because of bad weather, but you compound to that all the speculators
[46:24.740 --> 46:30.460]  racing around because the dollar is going in the toilet, and so every commodity is exploding.
[46:30.460 --> 46:34.260]  And so you're right. These foreigners that have better currencies than us, Americans
[46:34.260 --> 46:38.500]  can't compete for the food we grow now, and so a lot of staple items are going to have
[46:38.500 --> 46:41.820]  already exploded in price. You'll still be able to, I guess, fill your belly up on some
[46:41.820 --> 46:46.540]  of the side things, but that could potentially run low as well. The whole point is, is that
[46:46.540 --> 46:50.780]  during the Depression, this is why I believe people should get horrible food, regardless
[46:50.780 --> 46:54.340]  of what happens. And I don't know what's going to happen. I hope everything's fine.
[46:54.340 --> 46:59.980]  But bottom line, this, the economics, if you have 90% or 85% living on the farms, being
[46:59.980 --> 47:05.540]  self-sufficient in the 1930s, it's now 90% in the cities of the 10% on the farms, only
[47:05.540 --> 47:09.420]  half are self-sufficient. Most of the farms, you people just live on them and maybe have
[47:09.420 --> 47:14.260]  a horse or cow or two and they drive in to, you know, work at the coal plant or, you know,
[47:14.260 --> 47:21.980]  work at the prison. They're not self-sufficient. And so, and not just not having food. Like
[47:21.980 --> 47:26.380]  you said, I talked to people out in the country when the swan man comes through, the swan
[47:26.380 --> 47:30.740]  man's told us when we're out on our farm, that they're cutting back their route and
[47:30.740 --> 47:35.180]  that people aren't buying their food anymore after 40 years of going out there with a swan
[47:35.180 --> 47:40.500]  truck that delivers food to your house. So the people are just running out of money.
[47:40.500 --> 47:46.220]  And it's just amazing. Folks, you need to call Steve Shink. You need to get storeable
[47:46.220 --> 47:51.180]  food. Steve, if they just want a catalog or they just want to check out the website,
[47:51.180 --> 47:55.460]  eatfoodsdirect.com. But what about folks that don't have internet and just want to get a,
[47:55.460 --> 48:02.940]  you know, basic rundown of what you've got? Well, what they do is they call 800-409-5633
[48:02.940 --> 48:06.820]  and we send them out a whole packet. It's got a couple of CDs of some seminars that
[48:06.820 --> 48:13.820]  I've done and it also lists what's in there. This comparison is just phenomenal where you
[48:13.820 --> 48:19.420]  can literally put in a whole year supply of food this year at half the cost of your groceries
[48:19.420 --> 48:22.740]  from last year. You know, that's something that's key to add. You're saying you've got
[48:22.740 --> 48:26.340]  DVDs and audios and things for people that want them.
[48:26.340 --> 48:30.420]  Yep, absolutely. They, and they come out with the packet that they asked for. So ask for
[48:30.420 --> 48:35.940]  the dog on thing, get some information. Those of you that have a website access, get up
[48:35.940 --> 48:43.860]  on eatfoodsdirect.com, we've posted Alex about 200 articles that will fill people in on exactly
[48:43.860 --> 48:44.860]  what's happening.
[48:44.860 --> 48:45.860]  Oh, I see it.
[48:45.860 --> 48:52.660]  This is so real. It is so real that it's almost unbelievable how real it is.
[48:52.660 --> 48:57.660]  I know that most of your listeners or a lot of your listeners are sitting out there saying
[48:57.660 --> 49:03.980]  it can't be that bad. Honest. It really is. And even if you can't stand me, I know I
[49:03.980 --> 49:08.020]  could get pretty obnoxious. Alex is kind of a common, cool and collected dog.
[49:08.020 --> 49:09.020]  Oh, yeah, right.
[49:09.020 --> 49:10.020]  That's what I'm saying.
[49:10.020 --> 49:15.740]  But even if you can't stand me for Pete's sake, get food. Even if you don't get it from
[49:15.740 --> 49:19.220]  eatfoodsdirect, just look at our warning so you don't get some bad people.
[49:19.220 --> 49:22.580]  Well, bottom line, can people get that packet?
[49:22.580 --> 49:23.580]  A packet free?
[49:23.580 --> 49:28.620]  Oh, absolutely. We send it out free. Oh, and here's something that they've got to know.
[49:28.620 --> 49:33.900]  Pay close attention. As folks have called in and we tell them that we're shipping out
[49:33.900 --> 49:40.180]  these one-year supplies, it has a one-week shipping time. There are food companies out
[49:40.180 --> 49:43.500]  there that are talking about three and four months before they can get the back orders,
[49:43.500 --> 49:46.500]  and they will not be able to fill the back orders because they won't be able to get
[49:46.500 --> 49:47.500]  the food.
[49:47.500 --> 49:48.620]  No, listen, we've been approached by a lot of their food companies, but I'll go to their
[49:48.620 --> 49:53.700]  website. It'll say six weeks for delivery. I don't want to get involved in that. Even
[49:53.700 --> 49:57.140]  if they supposedly got good food, they can't deliver for six, eight weeks. People are asking
[49:57.140 --> 49:58.140]  me where it's at.
[49:58.140 --> 50:02.580]  Yeah, Steve Shank, it comes in just a few weeks every time I've ordered. Okay, give
[50:02.580 --> 50:05.980]  them that number again for people who want to call and get the free packet, bare minimum,
[50:05.980 --> 50:08.180]  with the CD and DVD.
[50:08.180 --> 50:18.580]  800-409-5633. 800-409-5633. And on the two-month grab-and-go, Alex, it's next day.
[50:18.580 --> 50:19.580]  Day shipment.
[50:19.580 --> 50:25.460]  Absolutely, folks. Again, in the last more than 10 years, it's good to have it regardless.
[50:25.460 --> 50:28.660]  It's great insurance. Everybody needs to have it. Thank you so much for spending time with
[50:28.660 --> 50:29.660]  us, Steve.
[50:29.660 --> 50:30.660]  Take care, Alex.
[50:30.660 --> 50:37.660]  There goes Steve Shank, folks. Great people, high-quality, clean, non-GMO food, eFoodsDirect.com.
[50:37.660 --> 50:41.940]  Okay, we're going to come back in more to the financial news, and then we're scheduled
[50:41.940 --> 50:47.060]  to have Jordan Maxwell on with us. And then Congressman Charles Key, big show lined up
[50:47.060 --> 50:54.060]  in the next three hours.
[50:54.060 --> 51:05.460]  Another untold story here it comes. Another untold story here it comes. Another untold
[51:05.460 --> 51:14.060]  story that you have not been told from. Another untoldstory.com.
[51:14.060 --> 51:20.380]  Victoria's Secret. Have you begun to wonder what it is, or shall we say what they are?
[51:20.380 --> 51:27.260]  On previous another untold story broadcast, we'd mentioned the first two suspected secrets.
[51:27.260 --> 51:34.700]  But frankly, we hesitate to mention the third suspected secret. It's just too unbelievable.
[51:34.700 --> 51:40.180]  It seems like it's out of a science fiction story. Ever heard the expression, truth is
[51:40.180 --> 51:46.620]  stranger than fiction? Ever think maybe science fiction is told so that when you discover
[51:46.620 --> 51:53.260]  truth you cannot believe it because it sounds like fiction? How many science fiction stories
[51:53.260 --> 52:00.100]  have you heard, read, or seen where aliens look like people? Lots. But what if it were
[52:00.100 --> 52:06.300]  true and you heard it? Well, you couldn't believe it because it sounds like fiction.
[52:06.300 --> 52:12.260]  That only happens in the movies. There is told of a prophecy in the greatest storybook
[52:12.260 --> 52:19.020]  written of, and I quote, I will make them jealous with those who are not a people, end
[52:19.020 --> 52:26.580]  quote. People. Could this be part of Victoria's Secret? Go to website anotheruntoldstory.com.

[53:43.220 --> 53:48.660]  hundreds of other titles. We're in a no-holds bar information war. Truth is our weapon and
[53:48.660 --> 54:05.940]  prisonplanet.com has the tools you need to take the fight back to Big Brother. All those
[54:05.940 --> 54:21.980]  Drifters days are past me now. All those Drifters days are past me now. I've got so much more
[54:21.980 --> 54:38.660]  to say. I've got so much more to say. I've got so much more to say. I've got so much
[54:38.660 --> 54:55.140]  But we were still running against the wind, against the wind, and the New World Order
[54:55.140 --> 55:00.040]  is running against the wind.
[55:00.040 --> 55:06.940]  Their evil will be punished, their tyranny will fall, their system is destined from
[55:06.940 --> 55:10.020]  its foundations to fall.
[55:10.020 --> 55:17.780]  Continuing here with the news, oil reaches $142 on view, dollar will keep falling.
[55:17.780 --> 55:23.060]  And then an insane story out of the London Telegraph.
[55:23.060 --> 55:25.780]  These are the real big financial papers.
[55:25.780 --> 55:31.140]  You notice when Brent Scrocoff, former National Security Advisor, top globalist, wanted to
[55:31.140 --> 55:37.660]  talk bad about Bush and say he was being handled by the Israelis in World War III, he wrote
[55:37.660 --> 55:41.420]  his letter to the Financial Times of London.
[55:41.420 --> 55:43.260]  That's the true paper of record globally.
[55:43.260 --> 55:46.140]  It's not the Wall Street Journal, it is not the New York Times.
[55:46.140 --> 55:52.020]  But a similar paper, the London Telegraph today, Barclays warns of financial storm as
[55:52.020 --> 55:55.500]  Federal Reserve's credibility crumbles.
[55:55.500 --> 56:00.020]  When they start talking like that, it means they're going to pin it on the Federal Reserve.
[56:00.020 --> 56:05.260]  From the beginning of Bernanke, though I love him, he's a puppet himself, and he's going
[56:05.260 --> 56:10.420]  to have it all pinned on him, while all these fools hail the private Federal Reserve former
[56:10.420 --> 56:15.780]  chieftain, Alan Greenspan, when it was his actions that destroyed the dollar, deliberately.
[56:15.780 --> 56:19.020]  See, these things are delayed.
[56:19.020 --> 56:23.820]  Bernanke's been in for a year and a half, almost two years.
[56:23.820 --> 56:29.140]  U.S. Central Bank accused of unleashing an inflation shock that will rock financial markets,
[56:29.140 --> 56:33.620]  Ambrose Evans-Pritchard.
[56:33.620 --> 56:34.620]  And that's it.
[56:34.620 --> 56:42.180]  It is a, how did the Fed release an inflation bomb?
[56:42.180 --> 56:45.340]  By issuing basically unlimited credit to their buddies.
[56:45.340 --> 56:51.180]  See, a shadow of all of their looting is giving loans to people that didn't have jobs and
[56:51.180 --> 56:53.300]  didn't have credit.
[56:53.300 --> 56:55.660]  That's a small part of this.
[56:55.660 --> 57:00.180]  They gave it to other corporations and companies to buy up real assets, then they shell those
[57:00.180 --> 57:05.460]  to other assets, to other companies that they hold, and then blow out and bankrupt the dummy
[57:05.460 --> 57:06.460]  front company.
[57:06.460 --> 57:10.780]  Basically, that's been done millions of times upon millions of times by their financial
[57:10.780 --> 57:16.700]  infrastructure, and they are designing all of this to leave us holding the bag.
[57:16.700 --> 57:20.700]  That's what you're not going to read in the Times of London, the Sunday Times of London,
[57:20.700 --> 57:24.220]  the Financial Times, the London Telegraph.
[57:24.220 --> 57:29.660]  Mark Lay's capital has advised clients to batten down the hatches for a worldwide financial
[57:29.660 --> 57:30.660]  storm.
[57:30.660 --> 57:34.580]  Oh, I thought the blast storm was six months ago.
[57:34.580 --> 57:40.100]  Warning that the U.S. Federal Reserve has allowed the inflation genie out of the bottle
[57:40.100 --> 57:44.180]  and let its credibility fall below zero.
[57:44.180 --> 57:49.740]  We're in a nasty environment, said Tim Bond, the Bank Chief Equity Strategist.
[57:49.740 --> 57:52.940]  There is an inflation shock underway.
[57:52.940 --> 57:56.940]  This is going to be very negative for financial assets.
[57:56.940 --> 58:07.240]  We are going to tortoise mood, and we are re-entering into our shell.
[58:07.240 --> 58:11.420]  Investors will do well if they can preserve their wealth.
[58:11.420 --> 58:16.860]  Investors will do well if they can preserve their wealth.
[58:16.860 --> 58:20.620]  We'll come back, finish up on the financials, then we'll talk about his running and all
[58:20.620 --> 58:22.780]  with our guest, Jordan Maxwell.
[58:22.780 --> 58:23.780]  It's not Monday.
[58:23.780 --> 58:24.780]  It's Friday.

[58:49.420 --> 58:51.780]  But in Liberty's darkest hour, there is hope.
[58:51.780 --> 58:54.820]  The first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[58:54.820 --> 58:59.060]  It is essential that patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding of the New

[59:00.580 --> 59:04.820]  We have a short time frame to fully awaken and energize the people to meet this threat.

[1:00:07.620 --> 1:00:15.420]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[1:00:15.420 --> 1:00:20.940]  Daily Mail headline, Wall Street plunges towards worse months since Great Depression, of the
[1:00:20.940 --> 1:00:25.580]  early 1930s on inflation worries.
[1:00:25.580 --> 1:00:30.100]  London Telegraph reports U.S. Central Bank accused of unleashing an inflation shock that
[1:00:30.100 --> 1:00:33.220]  will rock financial markets, reports Ambrose Evans-Britchers.
[1:00:33.220 --> 1:00:37.900]  Barclays Capital has advised clients to batten down the hatches for a worldwide financial
[1:00:37.900 --> 1:00:45.100]  storm, warning that U.S. Federal Reserve has allowed the inflation genie out of the bottle
[1:00:45.100 --> 1:00:48.780]  and let its credibility fall to zero.
[1:00:48.780 --> 1:00:50.900]  We're in a nasty environment, said Tim Bond.
[1:00:50.900 --> 1:00:52.900]  Barclays is about as respected as it gets, folks.
[1:00:52.900 --> 1:00:54.420]  The bank's chief equity strategist.
[1:00:54.420 --> 1:00:58.220]  There is an inflation shock underway.
[1:00:58.220 --> 1:01:01.500]  This is going to be very negative for financial assets.
[1:01:01.500 --> 1:01:07.140]  When we're going into the tortoise mode, then we're retreating into our shell, quote,
[1:01:07.140 --> 1:01:12.820]  investors will do well if they can preserve their wealth.
[1:01:12.820 --> 1:01:13.820]  You hear that?
[1:01:13.820 --> 1:01:17.740]  You will do well if you can preserve it, preserve it, wealth, preservation.
[1:01:17.740 --> 1:01:23.540]  This is the London Telegraph today, headline up on PrismPlanet.com.
[1:01:23.540 --> 1:01:27.380]  Barclays Capital said it's closely watched global outlook that U.S. headline inflation
[1:01:27.380 --> 1:01:31.740]  would massively expand in August and the Fed will have to raise interest rates six times
[1:01:31.740 --> 1:01:35.180]  by the end of the year to prevent a wage spiral.
[1:01:35.180 --> 1:01:36.340]  Give it hastens.
[1:01:36.340 --> 1:01:38.700]  The bond markets will take matters into their own hands.
[1:01:38.700 --> 1:01:43.140]  This is the first test for banks in 30 years that they will have to fulfill it.
[1:01:43.140 --> 1:01:49.940]  They have zero credibility and the Fed is negative if that's possible.
[1:01:49.940 --> 1:01:53.300]  It has lost all credibility, Mr. Bond said.
[1:01:53.300 --> 1:02:01.860]  Let me read you this again, chief strategist for, and chief equity strategist for Barclays.
[1:02:01.860 --> 1:02:06.060]  Let me read that to you again, investors will do well if they can preserve their wealth.
[1:02:06.060 --> 1:02:08.300]  I'm only having Ted on for two minutes.
[1:02:08.300 --> 1:02:11.020]  He literally is giving you these gold deals at cost.
[1:02:11.020 --> 1:02:14.620]  Ted, I think makes like two, three percent to pay his brokers and just get the order
[1:02:14.620 --> 1:02:20.140]  out the door and he's doing this to introduce you to real metals and to protection.
[1:02:20.140 --> 1:02:24.260]  Now Bloomberg and everybody else are saying it's going to go up to 5,000 an ounce.
[1:02:24.260 --> 1:02:25.540]  I'm not saying that.
[1:02:25.540 --> 1:02:28.540]  Gold's way up again today and this is the summer.
[1:02:28.540 --> 1:02:30.460]  We've never seen this.
[1:02:30.460 --> 1:02:32.820]  So wait till the fall.
[1:02:32.820 --> 1:02:36.860]  Now is the time to buy and it is shooting up right now, but Ted has at the price it
[1:02:36.860 --> 1:02:38.140]  was two days ago.
[1:02:38.140 --> 1:02:43.300]  Ted, A, can you hold the Swiss franc through the weekend?
[1:02:43.300 --> 1:02:46.820]  I told you I would and I'm going to even if I have to take a loss, which it kind of looks
[1:02:46.820 --> 1:02:50.740]  like I will, but I would suggest that everybody gets involved in the precious metals at this
[1:02:50.740 --> 1:02:51.740]  time.
[1:02:51.740 --> 1:02:52.740]  Hand writing is on the wall.
[1:02:52.740 --> 1:02:53.860]  It's boiling right now.
[1:02:53.860 --> 1:02:57.700]  All the financial analysts are saying the same thing just like you said.
[1:02:57.700 --> 1:02:58.980]  You better get moving on it.
[1:02:58.980 --> 1:02:59.980]  I do.
[1:02:59.980 --> 1:03:01.140]  I have those.
[1:03:01.140 --> 1:03:05.020]  Franks right now are currently at $194 apiece.
[1:03:05.020 --> 1:03:07.980]  That is a steal, especially with gold prices now where they are.
[1:03:07.980 --> 1:03:11.500]  Now, 243 for the British sovereign coin again.
[1:03:11.500 --> 1:03:16.660]  That's the same price I offered them for when gold was 888 three days ago with you.
[1:03:16.660 --> 1:03:24.020]  Right now, those roles of walking liberties are, again, just a steal at 182 per roll of
[1:03:24.020 --> 1:03:26.700]  20.
[1:03:26.700 --> 1:03:31.700]  Preservation of capital, I mean, finally they're waking up and saying it.
[1:03:31.700 --> 1:03:35.620]  We should have been preserving our capital three years ago and this is, you know, we'll
[1:03:35.620 --> 1:03:37.860]  be lucky just to be able to hold on to what we have.
[1:03:37.860 --> 1:03:40.980]  And that is going to accelerate the snowball all this bad news.
[1:03:40.980 --> 1:03:42.300]  I can't believe they're telling the truth.
[1:03:42.300 --> 1:03:45.020]  I mean, I have apie saying the same thing today.
[1:03:45.020 --> 1:03:47.140]  Give them the number to have people need to call now.
[1:03:47.140 --> 1:03:48.140]  Yeah.
[1:03:48.140 --> 1:03:51.140]  It's 1-800-686-2237.
[1:03:51.140 --> 1:03:55.900]  Again, it's 1-800-686-2237.
[1:03:55.900 --> 1:03:58.380]  The numbers are, you know, people are calling like crazy.
[1:03:58.380 --> 1:03:59.380]  Get your orders in.
[1:03:59.380 --> 1:04:01.900]  We'll get these things out the door to you real fast.
[1:04:01.900 --> 1:04:06.020]  You'll have them in your hand and you'll be, you'll be putting off an economic storm
[1:04:06.020 --> 1:04:07.540]  here that's coming.
[1:04:07.540 --> 1:04:10.740]  We already have the thunder clouds there like just rolling overhead right now.
[1:04:10.740 --> 1:04:12.820]  There's no reason not to get into this stuff.
[1:04:12.820 --> 1:04:16.900]  Well, I mean, even if gold isn't going to explode, which clearly the experts are all
[1:04:16.900 --> 1:04:17.900]  saying it is.
[1:04:17.900 --> 1:04:21.500]  The question is, will it be 2,500 or 5,000 in the next two years?
[1:04:21.500 --> 1:04:24.380]  And this could boil up any time, folks.
[1:04:24.380 --> 1:04:29.020]  We're sitting on top of a bunch of nitroglycerin with a topless dancer dancing around in spiked
[1:04:29.020 --> 1:04:30.540]  heels on top of it on the table.
[1:04:30.540 --> 1:04:34.820]  Well, I mean, what if the financial institutions, you have your investments in fail?
[1:04:34.820 --> 1:04:36.300]  I mean, just think of that right there.
[1:04:36.300 --> 1:04:42.420]  Or let me say somebody's beating on a bottle of nitroglycerin with a hammer, 800-686-2237.
[1:04:42.420 --> 1:04:43.420]  They'll be brokers.
[1:04:43.420 --> 1:04:47.420]  They're all weekend until midnight every night, 800-686-2237.
[1:04:47.420 --> 1:04:48.420]  Thanks, Ted.
[1:04:48.420 --> 1:04:49.420]  Thanks, Alex.
[1:04:49.420 --> 1:04:50.420]  You bet.
[1:04:50.420 --> 1:04:51.420]  We'll be right back.
[1:04:51.420 --> 1:04:55.660]  If you're a chocolate lover, then now you can use chocolate to get the healthy body you've
[1:04:55.660 --> 1:05:01.180]  always wanted, introducing Coco Pure Chocolate Tea, the most innovative health drink ever

[1:05:09.260 --> 1:05:14.140]  Coco Pure Chocolate Tea blends the nutrition of concentrated cocoa with natural green tea
[1:05:14.140 --> 1:05:15.900]  and an extract from red wine.

[1:05:20.180 --> 1:05:21.180]  and vegetables.
[1:05:21.180 --> 1:05:25.940]  It has a natural energy booster, digestive health boosters, and much more.

[1:05:51.220 --> 1:05:52.220]  Hi, neighbor.
[1:05:52.220 --> 1:05:54.540]  This is Steve Shank, Fearless Task Force.
[1:05:54.540 --> 1:05:57.940]  Life is a gamble, but you can stack the deck.
[1:05:57.940 --> 1:06:02.740]  If you knew what I know about all the problems food will protect you from, you'd start immediately
[1:06:02.740 --> 1:06:07.940]  to put every effort and dollar you can get into the biggest supply of food possible.
[1:06:07.940 --> 1:06:12.260]  When the dollar and economy crash, when the imported and genetically poisoned food is
[1:06:12.260 --> 1:06:17.560]  all that's left, when the quarantine and bird flu hit, our only protection and only
[1:06:17.560 --> 1:06:22.380]  chance to be fearless is having control of our own supply of food and enough of it.
[1:06:22.380 --> 1:06:26.060]  But if you knew what we haven't yet discovered, you wouldn't waste time listening to the rest
[1:06:26.060 --> 1:06:30.540]  of this announcement before charging out and getting a serious food supply.
[1:06:30.540 --> 1:06:36.060]  Decide it's food now or probably never, but can you afford to be wrong?
[1:06:36.060 --> 1:06:37.060]  Decide now.

[1:07:06.300 --> 1:07:09.460]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[1:07:09.460 --> 1:07:15.380]  Now as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80%
[1:07:15.380 --> 1:07:19.780]  of humanity is at hand.
[1:07:19.780 --> 1:07:25.260]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.

[1:07:34.940 --> 1:07:35.940]  They're after power.
[1:07:35.940 --> 1:07:36.940]  That's their after-easy.

[1:08:03.860 --> 1:08:10.060]  For the next hour and 55 minutes roughly, Jordan Maxwell is our guest.
[1:08:10.060 --> 1:08:13.540]  We had him on Monday for close to three hours and people really loved it and I thought why
[1:08:13.540 --> 1:08:18.780]  why not have Jordan back up on the show.
[1:08:18.780 --> 1:08:22.540]  This hour we're just going to talk about whatever issues he wants to discuss and in the next
[1:08:22.540 --> 1:08:27.580]  hour we're going to open the phones up for Jordan Maxwell here on the GCN radio network.
[1:08:27.580 --> 1:08:33.220]  Don't forget my new film, Truth Rising is coming out next July 4th.

[1:08:51.900 --> 1:08:53.920]  It is the history of the 9-11 Truth Movement.
[1:08:53.920 --> 1:08:58.020]  We are changed confronting all these globalists, taking over their media events and showing
[1:08:58.020 --> 1:09:01.780]  on the first responders were poisoned by the dust, how the government knowingly covered
[1:09:01.780 --> 1:09:04.940]  it up and then their quest to get treatment.
[1:09:04.940 --> 1:09:05.940]  Very important film.
[1:09:05.940 --> 1:09:06.940]  Cinema Verite.
[1:09:06.940 --> 1:09:07.940]  I'm like any film I've ever made.
[1:09:07.940 --> 1:09:17.580]  I'm very proud of Truth Rising available right now at infowars.com or by calling 888-253-3139.
[1:09:17.580 --> 1:09:19.700]  Jordan Maxwell.com is the website.
[1:09:19.700 --> 1:09:22.980]  Jordan, did you get a big response when you came on the show Monday?
[1:09:22.980 --> 1:09:24.460]  Oh, did I ever?
[1:09:24.460 --> 1:09:25.460]  Yeah.
[1:09:25.460 --> 1:09:26.460]  Thank you very much for that.
[1:09:26.460 --> 1:09:30.780]  It's just tremendous outpouring and I appreciate everybody.
[1:09:30.780 --> 1:09:36.140]  That was one of the things I wanted to say that I cannot get back to everyone who has
[1:09:36.140 --> 1:09:43.500]  e-mailed and called me because I just inundated with e-mails, but I really appreciate everybody
[1:09:43.500 --> 1:09:48.420]  and everything that everyone has been saying, so I thank everybody for that.
[1:09:48.420 --> 1:09:51.180]  You were telling me during the break that it may have been the biggest response you
[1:09:51.180 --> 1:09:52.180]  ever gotten, Radio?
[1:09:52.180 --> 1:09:53.180]  Yeah.
[1:09:53.180 --> 1:09:58.380]  It very well could be the biggest response I've ever received because, you know, at
[1:09:58.380 --> 1:10:03.540]  my website, I guess, went down about three different times and my webman is very good
[1:10:03.540 --> 1:10:08.380]  at taking care of those problems, but he just couldn't keep up with it because it kept going
[1:10:08.380 --> 1:10:14.580]  down and so we've had to go to a new server that can take that kind of a hit because I
[1:10:14.580 --> 1:10:21.820]  got a tremendous amount of hits on the web, on the website, so hopefully that won't happen
[1:10:21.820 --> 1:10:22.820]  anymore.
[1:10:22.820 --> 1:10:23.820]  Sure.
[1:10:23.820 --> 1:10:29.940]  And of course, I've had problems with actually being shut down by NSA and security police
[1:10:29.940 --> 1:10:36.500]  have shut my site down on occasions and really destroyed my e-mail, but that was done, you
[1:10:36.500 --> 1:10:42.580]  know, a few years ago, back in 2005, so I think the problems I had with your program
[1:10:42.580 --> 1:10:46.740]  was the fact that it just had so many hits, so I think that's been taken care of.
[1:10:46.740 --> 1:10:48.460]  We've got a bigger server now.
[1:10:48.460 --> 1:10:49.460]  Good.
[1:10:49.460 --> 1:10:50.460]  Good.
[1:10:50.460 --> 1:10:54.740]  Jordan, I want you in the next hour and 50 minutes to talk about any subjects you want,
[1:10:54.740 --> 1:11:00.860]  and first do that, but I want to get more into the globalist master plan, more of what
[1:11:00.860 --> 1:11:05.700]  drives them, what the world will look like if they have their way, expand on your 50
[1:11:05.700 --> 1:11:10.140]  years of research, you're saying that you believe they are trying to mutate humanity
[1:11:10.140 --> 1:11:14.580]  and now they even say that in declassified documents, two species, so I want to get into
[1:11:14.580 --> 1:11:20.300]  that as soon as possible and then, you know, the more into the teutonic system and the
[1:11:20.300 --> 1:11:25.780]  rest of it, but first off, anything Jordan Maxwell wants to talk about, anything you
[1:11:25.780 --> 1:11:28.380]  think is important that this huge audience needs to hear?
[1:11:28.380 --> 1:11:29.660]  Well, I appreciate that.
[1:11:29.660 --> 1:11:34.140]  I really thank you for the opportunity of getting some things off my chest that's been
[1:11:34.140 --> 1:11:37.500]  bothering me for a long time.
[1:11:37.500 --> 1:11:43.180]  First of all, I got a lot of phone calls and e-mails from people who say, I sent you an
[1:11:43.180 --> 1:11:48.780]  e-mail and you didn't answer, I called you but you didn't call me back, you know, I
[1:11:48.780 --> 1:11:55.540]  get anywhere from 50 to 60 phone calls a day and I get like two or three hundred e-mails
[1:11:55.540 --> 1:12:02.860]  a day every day, so it's like 1500 a week, I live by myself with my brother in two rooms
[1:12:02.860 --> 1:12:10.980]  and I don't have a secretary, I don't have, you know, a big background of people to help
[1:12:10.980 --> 1:12:17.900]  me get out e-mails and, you know, correspond with people, it's just me, by myself, I don't
[1:12:17.900 --> 1:12:22.620]  have a secretary, I don't have anybody to answer e-mails and I'm almost 70 years old,
[1:12:22.620 --> 1:12:27.540]  I don't type to start with and I don't know that much about computers to begin with, so
[1:12:27.540 --> 1:12:31.420]  and then I get a lot of people saying, well, did you get this e-mail that, did you get
[1:12:31.420 --> 1:12:33.300]  this picture I sent?
[1:12:33.300 --> 1:12:41.180]  Yeah, I get tons of stuff every day, continually, but I don't have the ability to get back to
[1:12:41.180 --> 1:12:42.180]  every one.
[1:12:42.180 --> 1:12:45.060]  Well, because you brought this up, let me say something about it because this is one
[1:12:45.060 --> 1:12:49.300]  of the few, you know, areas where we can, you know, say we've experienced the exact
[1:12:49.300 --> 1:12:56.460]  same thing, people will get mad and I get thousands of e-mails a day that I don't respond
[1:12:56.460 --> 1:13:01.380]  and they want a personal relationship with you and then they become your enemy because
[1:13:01.380 --> 1:13:06.300]  you can't respond and they need to realize and be adults that Jordan does read what
[1:13:06.300 --> 1:13:10.300]  you're sending and does look at it, but he barely has time for that, at least, I mean,
[1:13:10.300 --> 1:13:15.020]  I'm speaking for you, but in my case, somebody looks at it, somebody reads it, but, but
[1:13:15.020 --> 1:13:20.740]  there's so much of it that we could never respond to it all unless it was an automatic,
[1:13:20.740 --> 1:13:24.860]  you know, response e-mail back and that's what the politicians do.
[1:13:24.860 --> 1:13:29.740]  So and Jordan's a sensitive, nice, intelligent fellow and I can tell it hurts his feelings
[1:13:29.740 --> 1:13:34.100]  when that happens, but I'm, you know, the public is getting more and more crass, myself
[1:13:34.100 --> 1:13:35.100]  included.
[1:13:35.100 --> 1:13:36.100]  No doubt about it.
[1:13:36.100 --> 1:13:40.380]  Less and less gentlemanly, you're very gentlemanly, I'm probably not to some extent, you know,
[1:13:40.380 --> 1:13:44.820]  we're becoming more and more ogre-like and so a gentleman like you, I think, you know,
[1:13:44.820 --> 1:13:48.740]  it's, it's, it's frustrating, but you just got to get a thicker skin, Jordan, because,
[1:13:48.740 --> 1:13:49.980]  you know, it's not going to stop.
[1:13:49.980 --> 1:13:55.740]  Well, I know, I know, I try and answer everybody, but like I said, most people don't know it.
[1:13:55.740 --> 1:14:00.220]  I don't mind putting myself on the line and, and you know, I'm not trying to present myself
[1:14:00.220 --> 1:14:03.260]  to the world as anything but who I am.
[1:14:03.260 --> 1:14:08.780]  I, I live with my brother in two rooms with no shower, I, you know, I just live by myself.
[1:14:08.780 --> 1:14:14.780]  I don't have anybody here to help me do anything and I've been very, very sick for a long
[1:14:14.780 --> 1:14:15.780]  time.
[1:14:15.780 --> 1:14:17.780]  My brother's even sicker than I am.
[1:14:17.780 --> 1:14:22.780]  And so I get, you know, like I said, hundreds of emails a day from all over the world.
[1:14:22.780 --> 1:14:28.140]  And another thing is that people email me, but they don't tell me where they are emailing
[1:14:28.140 --> 1:14:29.140]  from.
[1:14:29.140 --> 1:14:33.380]  I don't want a particular address, but I would like to know what country or what state
[1:14:33.380 --> 1:14:37.620]  or what city, because I get emails from all over the world, but you know, it could be
[1:14:37.620 --> 1:14:41.900]  from down the street or it could be in South Africa, I don't know.
[1:14:41.900 --> 1:14:48.180]  And so I would like to know where emails are coming from and I like for people to know
[1:14:48.180 --> 1:14:49.500]  that I read everything.
[1:14:49.500 --> 1:14:54.540]  I sit here for hours and go through all the emails and on occasions I'll even answer
[1:14:54.540 --> 1:14:59.860]  them if I feel it's important and I, that I do that, I'll try and answer them.
[1:14:59.860 --> 1:15:04.260]  But you know, hundreds of day with no help, it's just very difficult.
[1:15:04.260 --> 1:15:10.060]  And yes, I get people actually threatening that we all, and here's another problem.
[1:15:10.060 --> 1:15:15.500]  People will take, go out and buy a video of mine and then they reproduce it and put it
[1:15:15.500 --> 1:15:22.140]  out on the market under a different name and, and begins selling it all over the world.
[1:15:22.140 --> 1:15:27.660]  And then I get emails and phone calls and people say, where is the product I ordered?
[1:15:27.660 --> 1:15:29.580]  We're going to report you to the authorities.
[1:15:29.580 --> 1:15:31.300]  We're going to report you to a better business.
[1:15:31.300 --> 1:15:36.660]  Yeah, we have that all the time is, is that that's the nature of all this where people
[1:15:36.660 --> 1:15:41.260]  mail in bootleg copies of my films, demanding more copies or something.
[1:15:41.260 --> 1:15:44.860]  But Jordan, again, I mean, I'm happy to air all this here on air, but I just don't think,
[1:15:44.860 --> 1:15:48.140]  you know, I mean, it's kind of like the Dutch boy trying to hold back the flood.
[1:15:48.140 --> 1:15:49.340]  Yeah, I think you're right.
[1:15:49.340 --> 1:15:54.700]  I know it just bothers me terrible that, that people assume that I don't care and just
[1:15:54.700 --> 1:15:57.740]  assume that I, I am not answering them.
[1:15:57.740 --> 1:16:02.140]  And one, one guy wrote me and said, you're obviously not answering me because I have
[1:16:02.140 --> 1:16:03.140]  a Jewish last name.
[1:16:03.140 --> 1:16:10.380]  I mean, that's ludicrous and so, you know, I'm just voicing my concern, and of course,
[1:16:10.380 --> 1:16:16.060]  on the other hand, I want to also talk about the fact of what I believe about God, because
[1:16:16.060 --> 1:16:22.940]  Lord knows there's so much out there, a pro and con about me concerning my, my faith.
[1:16:22.940 --> 1:16:28.060]  First of all, I am not anti God, I'm not anti Christ, I'm not anti anything.
[1:16:28.060 --> 1:16:34.940]  I have a highest of respect for what we would refer to as God.
[1:16:34.940 --> 1:16:41.060]  I believe in what I, my belief about God is that there is a very powerful divine spirit
[1:16:41.060 --> 1:16:43.740]  in the universe.
[1:16:43.740 --> 1:16:47.740]  And that spirit as wise, intelligent and powerful.
[1:16:47.740 --> 1:16:54.860]  And I have the highest of respect and honor for the superior spirit in the universe.
[1:16:54.860 --> 1:17:01.540]  So in that way, I have a very high regard for God and for truth and for spirit, you
[1:17:01.540 --> 1:17:07.980]  know, but I'm also intellectually aware that God is simply a word in English that can be
[1:17:07.980 --> 1:17:14.180]  translated different ways and, and God is like I always say, God is simply dog's bell
[1:17:14.180 --> 1:17:15.180]  backwards.
[1:17:15.180 --> 1:17:19.140]  And then men claim that they own that thing called God and then claim you've got to follow
[1:17:19.140 --> 1:17:21.180]  them and make themselves God.
[1:17:21.180 --> 1:17:22.340]  And I see that everywhere.
[1:17:22.340 --> 1:17:25.700]  They claim you're an atheist, they claim you believe in this, that, and I know Jordan
[1:17:25.700 --> 1:17:29.340]  Maxwell have interviewed him many times and read and seen his work.
[1:17:29.340 --> 1:17:30.340]  That's not what he's saying.
[1:17:30.340 --> 1:17:32.940]  He's saying that what you're told is Christianity.
[1:17:32.940 --> 1:17:38.900]  What you're told of these different religions is really just a repackaging of this mystery
[1:17:38.900 --> 1:17:39.900]  school.
[1:17:39.900 --> 1:17:40.900]  That's exactly right.
[1:17:40.900 --> 1:17:45.460]  And consequently, I, I have the highest of regard for, and I've got over 40 Bibles
[1:17:45.460 --> 1:17:52.980]  on the, you know, in my collection, I've, I've, I'm a student of theology.
[1:17:52.980 --> 1:18:00.740]  I've loved theology, especially the New Testament and I believe that the Bible, especially the
[1:18:00.740 --> 1:18:07.500]  New Testament is just jam packed with wisdom and knowledge and understanding.
[1:18:07.500 --> 1:18:13.380]  I have no problem with anything that Jesus has reputed to have said or is recorded to
[1:18:13.380 --> 1:18:14.380]  have said.
[1:18:14.380 --> 1:18:16.940]  I live by those principles.
[1:18:16.940 --> 1:18:24.020]  All I'm saying is that there is a whole world of a cult or hidden knowledge, which most
[1:18:24.020 --> 1:18:29.340]  people are not privy to even know exist, which I have studied all of my life.
[1:18:29.340 --> 1:18:32.620]  And so I, I, I look at things differently.
[1:18:32.620 --> 1:18:38.820]  I look at where it was written, what culture wrote it, where it originally came from, the
[1:18:38.820 --> 1:18:41.460]  etymology of the words.
[1:18:41.460 --> 1:18:46.860]  So I have the highest of regard for spirituality and for what is written in the Bible, the
[1:18:46.860 --> 1:18:47.860]  words of Jesus.
[1:18:47.860 --> 1:18:48.860]  I live by those.
[1:18:48.860 --> 1:18:50.860]  So I'm not anti God.
[1:18:50.860 --> 1:18:58.080]  I'm not anti, uh, you want to tell people that outside of Baptist church, uh, steeple
[1:18:58.080 --> 1:19:03.700]  is a phallic symbol and is not worshiping the God you're told.
[1:19:03.700 --> 1:19:04.700]  That's exactly right.
[1:19:04.700 --> 1:19:09.700]  And most of those, most of those Masonic preachers know that and it's a big joke to them, isn't
[1:19:09.700 --> 1:19:10.700]  it, Jordan?
[1:19:10.700 --> 1:19:11.700]  Yeah, it is.
[1:19:11.700 --> 1:19:16.020]  And I've sat with, I've sat with rabbis, I've sat with priests, I've sat, uh, because
[1:19:16.020 --> 1:19:21.900]  that's what I do and, and I'm sitting with all of these people who are major names and
[1:19:21.900 --> 1:19:26.580]  theology and religion and research and they all smile and say, yeah, I know, yeah, I know
[1:19:26.580 --> 1:19:29.540]  well, but they, you know, the people need something.
[1:19:29.540 --> 1:19:34.300]  So we just tell them what they want to hear and, uh, I've just amazed with that.
[1:19:34.300 --> 1:19:37.020]  I said, why don't you tell them the truth?
[1:19:37.020 --> 1:19:39.300]  That's even more startling.
[1:19:39.300 --> 1:19:42.140]  And they said the people don't want the truth.
[1:19:42.140 --> 1:19:44.900]  The people want to hear what they want to hear.
[1:19:44.900 --> 1:19:46.460]  Jordan Maxwell, stay there.
[1:19:46.460 --> 1:19:48.900]  We'll be right back in just one moment.
[1:19:48.900 --> 1:19:51.900]  Gold.
[1:19:51.900 --> 1:19:55.980]  It's like nothing else on earth from the Romans through the Renaissance, from the industrial
[1:19:55.980 --> 1:19:57.900]  age to the space age.
[1:19:57.900 --> 1:20:01.580]  Gold has weathered the test of time for 6,000 years.
[1:20:01.580 --> 1:20:04.060]  Gold has remained the ultimate store of wealth.
[1:20:04.060 --> 1:20:08.220]  According to the World Gold Council in the U.S. Mint, demand is at an all time high.
[1:20:08.220 --> 1:20:12.660]  The stage is being set for the reemergence of gold as the common sense alternative to
[1:20:12.660 --> 1:20:16.540]  a fiat paper currency that gets weaker every day.
[1:20:16.540 --> 1:20:20.540]  Midas Resources is proud to offer the hard hitting report that arms you with the truth
[1:20:20.540 --> 1:20:25.500]  you need to protect you and your family from the fed's plans for your hard earned money.

[1:20:51.180 --> 1:20:55.060]  It is now time to reign in evil and bring them to justice.
[1:20:55.060 --> 1:20:59.980]  Through the authority that has been delegated to us, it is time to destroy the destroyers.
[1:20:59.980 --> 1:21:04.460]  The number of the mounted troops was 200 million, the vast majority of the population
[1:21:04.460 --> 1:21:08.740]  of the US, though the people of the US where their numbers and influence are strongest
[1:21:08.740 --> 1:21:12.820]  have primary responsibility for reigning the men and bringing them to justice.
[1:21:12.820 --> 1:21:16.460]  All nations will participate since they reside the world over.
[1:21:16.460 --> 1:21:20.860]  They are called Illuminati, elite, proponents of the New World Order.
[1:21:20.860 --> 1:21:23.620]  They oppose everything that is God and truth.
[1:21:23.620 --> 1:21:28.140]  They are of the line that was disinherited 2,000 years ago, everything they have built
[1:21:28.140 --> 1:21:32.820]  over the centuries, the wealth they have accumulated, the power they have established, the poisoning
[1:21:32.820 --> 1:21:37.820]  of the masses, the destruction of the earth and mankind, we will undo through the authority
[1:21:37.820 --> 1:21:40.380]  that has now been delegated to us.

[1:21:51.580 --> 1:21:55.340]  Did you know the accumulation of acidic waste in the body is the single largest cause of
[1:21:55.340 --> 1:21:57.860]  disease such as cancer or diabetes?
[1:21:57.860 --> 1:22:01.900]  Acidic waste is created by the types of food we eat, what we drink, the environment and
[1:22:01.900 --> 1:22:03.620]  our high stress lifestyles.
[1:22:03.620 --> 1:22:07.740]  It's these choices that cause decreased energy, weight gain and eventually disease.
[1:22:07.740 --> 1:22:12.220]  The easiest way to reduce disease causing acidic waste is by drinking alkaline ionized
[1:22:12.220 --> 1:22:13.220]  water.

[1:23:47.220 --> 1:24:13.220]  Join the info war today.
[1:24:13.220 --> 1:24:32.140]  You have a secret society that has governed the world for thousands of years.
[1:24:32.140 --> 1:24:33.140]  They know all the secrets.
[1:24:33.140 --> 1:24:36.420]  They know if Atlantis was real.
[1:24:36.420 --> 1:24:41.940]  They know who built the pyramids.
[1:24:41.940 --> 1:24:45.020]  They have a lot of advanced knowledge.
[1:24:45.020 --> 1:24:49.420]  It's main line history that NASA was founded by Deepa Cultist.
[1:24:49.420 --> 1:24:51.700]  Everything they do is occultic.
[1:24:51.700 --> 1:24:54.860]  Now we're getting evidence that NASA was involved in Oklahoma City, excuse me, in the World
[1:24:54.860 --> 1:25:00.580]  Trade Center attacks with the thermate that comes from one of their developments.
[1:25:00.580 --> 1:25:07.460]  I mean it's just all interconnected and we have this group who has the knowledge.
[1:25:07.460 --> 1:25:10.900]  They have all their little subsidiaries and only have part of the knowledge.
[1:25:10.900 --> 1:25:15.580]  There's so much to talk about.
[1:25:15.580 --> 1:25:20.420]  Where should we start trying to give, you know, unlock minds and explain to people the
[1:25:20.420 --> 1:25:22.820]  nature of what we face?
[1:25:22.820 --> 1:25:26.340]  You know, let me go on with some of what we were already talking about.
[1:25:26.340 --> 1:25:31.140]  People will write me a call and say, where can I get information on this subject, on
[1:25:31.140 --> 1:25:32.640]  that subject?
[1:25:32.640 --> 1:25:37.540]  When it's sitting right there on my website, sitting right there on the subject that they're
[1:25:37.540 --> 1:25:45.300]  looking for, I go into in detail and one of the research boxes are on links or the e-books
[1:25:45.300 --> 1:25:48.300]  that are on my website because I don't put things on my website.
[1:25:48.300 --> 1:25:49.940]  But most people are babies now.
[1:25:49.940 --> 1:25:51.580]  They want to be spoon fed things.
[1:25:51.580 --> 1:25:52.580]  I know.
[1:25:52.580 --> 1:25:57.180]  I know and it's just very, very depressing to me because there's so many people out
[1:25:57.180 --> 1:26:02.860]  there that need to educate themselves and I have to stop and go back.
[1:26:02.860 --> 1:26:08.780]  You know, how many phone calls and emails I get from people who, oh, I ask them, I said,
[1:26:08.780 --> 1:26:10.220]  well, did you go on my website?
[1:26:10.220 --> 1:26:11.220]  They say yes.
[1:26:11.220 --> 1:26:15.420]  And I said, well, did you see the stuff on the links?
[1:26:15.420 --> 1:26:18.060]  And they said, no, no, we didn't see any links.
[1:26:18.060 --> 1:26:23.500]  Well, did you go to the research boxes, all the boxes on research, all the different subjects?
[1:26:23.500 --> 1:26:25.180]  No, we didn't see that.
[1:26:25.180 --> 1:26:32.380]  I said, well, did you go to the pictures or the audio video page on my, no, we didn't
[1:26:32.380 --> 1:26:33.900]  see any audio video.
[1:26:33.900 --> 1:26:38.460]  So then I usually end up asking, well, tell you what, why don't you tell me what you
[1:26:38.460 --> 1:26:42.700]  did see because you obviously haven't looked at anything.
[1:26:42.700 --> 1:26:44.580]  You haven't seen anything on my website.
[1:26:44.580 --> 1:26:49.220]  You just see the home page and then you call and ask me questions which are sitting right
[1:26:49.220 --> 1:26:50.220]  there on my website.
[1:26:50.220 --> 1:26:52.900]  Well, Jordan, I mean, people just want to talk to you.
[1:26:52.900 --> 1:26:53.900]  I know.
[1:26:53.900 --> 1:26:54.900]  That's what it is.
[1:26:54.900 --> 1:26:58.780]  They want to be able to say they talked to Jordan, but I'm 67 years old and very sick
[1:26:58.780 --> 1:27:04.460]  and I don't have time to sit and talk to one person at a time, the six billion on the earth.
[1:27:04.460 --> 1:27:11.460]  I'd like for people to go to my website and go through all of it, all of the boxes of
[1:27:11.460 --> 1:27:18.540]  materials and all of the words to research, I got tons of words on there that are very
[1:27:18.540 --> 1:27:19.540]  important.
[1:27:19.540 --> 1:27:22.860]  I don't put stuff on my website just to fill out space.
[1:27:22.860 --> 1:27:27.860]  I'll put it on there because it's part of my personal research and things which I consider
[1:27:27.860 --> 1:27:32.780]  to be very important, so I'll put it on my website and then I have to sit and talk with
[1:27:32.780 --> 1:27:38.380]  people, explain to them, well, go on my website and hit this button and what button?
[1:27:38.380 --> 1:27:43.060]  That button there that says research and then I have to sit there for five minutes and wait
[1:27:43.060 --> 1:27:46.980]  for them to figure out what the word research means and then they can go on.
[1:27:46.980 --> 1:27:52.540]  So I will spend hours on a phone with somebody from the middle of nowhere trying to show
[1:27:52.540 --> 1:27:56.700]  them how to do research, how to read and how to think.
[1:27:56.700 --> 1:27:59.140]  Well, it's just incredible.
[1:27:59.140 --> 1:28:03.420]  The architects have done a great job at teaching people how to not think, but at least they're
[1:28:03.420 --> 1:28:05.620]  groping in the dark starting to try to learn.
[1:28:05.620 --> 1:28:10.780]  Well, I know, I know, but it's very difficult for someone who's old and sick and tired and
[1:28:10.780 --> 1:28:16.060]  been doing it for 48 years and I'm just one person at a time, one person at a time.
[1:28:16.060 --> 1:28:19.820]  Now, I understand that, Jordan, but the good news is people are starting to question more
[1:28:19.820 --> 1:28:21.740]  than they ever have, but it is frustrating.
[1:28:21.740 --> 1:28:26.580]  I'll have articles, mainstream stories about camps for the American people and the government
[1:28:26.580 --> 1:28:29.940]  saying they're going to put us in them and the government saying they're poisoning us
[1:28:29.940 --> 1:28:32.540]  and people just say, I choose not to believe that.
[1:28:32.540 --> 1:28:33.540]  Oh, okay.
[1:28:33.540 --> 1:28:37.820]  You know, like choosing to say it doesn't exist makes it so.
[1:28:37.820 --> 1:28:39.700]  Oh, okay.
[1:28:39.700 --> 1:28:45.700]  And I, you know, I'm just amazed that the Jews do that in 1940 Berlin.
[1:28:45.700 --> 1:28:47.740]  No, you don't have a choice now.
[1:28:47.740 --> 1:28:49.740]  It's in your face.
[1:28:49.740 --> 1:28:52.220]  So I know it's just incredible.
[1:28:52.220 --> 1:28:58.300]  And so I just do the best I can and have to live with the threats and the disappointments
[1:28:58.300 --> 1:28:59.740]  and all the rest of it.
[1:28:59.740 --> 1:29:05.140]  I just do the best I can, but anyway, I just also want to make sure that everyone knows
[1:29:05.140 --> 1:29:10.300]  there's a lot of my material out there on the web and out there for free.
[1:29:10.300 --> 1:29:11.940]  I didn't put anything on the web.
[1:29:11.940 --> 1:29:16.300]  I've never put anything on the web ever, but there's a lot of stuff out there that's
[1:29:16.300 --> 1:29:20.100]  under a new title, under different titles that I don't know anything about.
[1:29:20.100 --> 1:29:25.380]  They're using my stuff with different titles, so that's the name of that tune.
[1:29:25.380 --> 1:29:29.220]  All right, well, we'll come back and get into the nature of the New World Order on the other
[1:29:29.220 --> 1:29:30.980]  side of a Jordan Maxwell.
[1:29:30.980 --> 1:29:41.340]  Stay with us.
[1:29:41.340 --> 1:29:42.660]  We're on the march.

[1:30:02.140 --> 1:30:04.540]  destroys the official fable forever.

[1:30:08.900 --> 1:30:13.700]  family members receive answers to their questions and the true perpetrators of the horrendous
[1:30:13.700 --> 1:30:15.540]  crime are brought to justice.

[1:33:27.020 --> 1:33:37.940]  Before the Beatles and yesterday, when a man could still work, he still would.
[1:33:37.940 --> 1:33:55.140]  It's the best of the free life behind us now and are we good time drilling over for good.
[1:33:55.140 --> 1:34:10.220]  Why we rollin' downhill like a snowball headed for hell with no kind of chance for the flag
[1:34:10.220 --> 1:34:14.820]  or the river to fell.
[1:34:14.820 --> 1:34:17.820]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:34:17.820 --> 1:34:24.820]  I wish you four down to Chevy, we're still as ten years like the shoe.
[1:34:24.820 --> 1:34:28.100]  Why does CBS have a all-seeing eye?
[1:34:28.100 --> 1:34:30.620]  Why do you see all-seeing eyes all over everything?
[1:34:30.620 --> 1:34:36.020]  Why are there all the occult symbols all over the NASA aircraft, spacecraft?
[1:34:36.020 --> 1:34:38.780]  Why does a judge wear a black robes?
[1:34:38.780 --> 1:34:41.700]  Why do churches have steeples?
[1:34:41.700 --> 1:34:47.940]  These all have answers and Jordan Maxwell's a great researcher into all of that.
[1:34:47.940 --> 1:34:56.660]  We'll talk about the esoteric operation, the matrix-like world that we're living in.
[1:34:56.660 --> 1:35:00.740]  That's a good place to start before we get into the courts because there are so many
[1:35:00.740 --> 1:35:05.300]  facets to this and the history of this and where all this began.
[1:35:05.300 --> 1:35:12.700]  But Jordan, taking 9-11, all the two towers, the Masonic meaning of that, the date 9-11,
[1:35:12.700 --> 1:35:17.780]  people pointed out hundreds of different esoteric things that happened there.
[1:35:17.780 --> 1:35:21.820]  But with so many other historical events, they're going to have the Olympics on 888
[1:35:21.820 --> 1:35:28.740]  and started at 888, Hitler and all the occultism he was into.
[1:35:28.740 --> 1:35:33.420]  The elites are totally into the occult and they can just carry forward all of these ancient
[1:35:33.420 --> 1:35:34.420]  symbols.
[1:35:34.420 --> 1:35:38.860]  So I think a good place to throw it at you is 9-11, all the esoteric are there.
[1:35:38.860 --> 1:35:46.780]  Well, yeah, the 888 is a numerical equivalent for the Messiah for Jesus.
[1:35:46.780 --> 1:35:54.100]  The Messianic number is 888 that has to do with the new order of civilization.
[1:35:54.100 --> 1:36:04.220]  There's just so much to talk about in relation to the esoteric and secret symbolism.
[1:36:04.220 --> 1:36:11.540]  For instance, in the ancient Hebrew and in the ancient Semitic world, the number 8 was
[1:36:11.540 --> 1:36:17.180]  a number for new beginnings, to begin things new was the number 8.
[1:36:17.180 --> 1:36:22.980]  Of course, if you lay the 8 down on its side, it becomes the symbol for infinity because
[1:36:22.980 --> 1:36:29.020]  8 is the only number that you can continue to write without lifting your pen from the
[1:36:29.020 --> 1:36:30.020]  paper.
[1:36:30.020 --> 1:36:33.180]  8 is the number that goes into infinity.
[1:36:33.180 --> 1:36:38.300]  You don't have to lift your pen from the paper to write 8, so lay it down on its side,
[1:36:38.300 --> 1:36:39.300]  it becomes infinity.
[1:36:39.300 --> 1:36:41.660]  It's eating itself too.
[1:36:41.660 --> 1:36:47.300]  Yeah, and so, consequently, 8 was the number of a new beginnings or continuing to begin
[1:36:47.300 --> 1:36:48.540]  a new.
[1:36:48.540 --> 1:36:53.740]  And of course, 13, the unlucky number of 13, the reason why it's unlucky because it's
[1:36:53.740 --> 1:37:00.860]  a divine number because it has to do with Jesus and his followers, his 12 followers.
[1:37:00.860 --> 1:37:05.860]  So the Master, with his 12 followers, makes 13.
[1:37:05.860 --> 1:37:14.460]  And so, consequently, we have the number 13 being the perfect number, an ancient mythology,
[1:37:14.460 --> 1:37:22.100]  the perfect number for government, 13, because it's a heavenly number, Jesus, with his 12,
[1:37:22.100 --> 1:37:24.020]  making the new government of the world.
[1:37:24.020 --> 1:37:27.820]  And then we see the Knights Templars getting slaughtered on Friday the 13th.
[1:37:27.820 --> 1:37:34.300]  That's exactly right, and so what I'm saying is that the Knights Templars in the Masonic
[1:37:34.300 --> 1:37:40.020]  Orders realized that they had to, if they were going to do this revolt against the old
[1:37:40.020 --> 1:37:47.780]  order in Europe, they wanted it to match the Masonic symbolism of numbers, numerology,
[1:37:47.780 --> 1:37:52.860]  of course, one of the books in the Bible is called Numbers.
[1:37:52.860 --> 1:38:02.100]  And so, they had to have their revolution in 1776 because 1 and 7 is 8, and 7 and 6
[1:38:02.100 --> 1:38:03.100]  is 13.
[1:38:03.100 --> 1:38:04.820]  I'm glad you bring that up.
[1:38:04.820 --> 1:38:11.820]  We have the Illuminati supposedly being founded at Ingolstadt University, 1776 launching its
[1:38:11.820 --> 1:38:16.940]  Operation Overthrow Europe, simultaneously you have it starting here in the United States.
[1:38:16.940 --> 1:38:21.860]  Was our revolution started by the same people, or did they try to co-opt it?
[1:38:21.860 --> 1:38:29.540]  I think maybe probably a little bit of both, but I'm sure that the American Revolution
[1:38:29.540 --> 1:38:35.100]  was well-planned in Europe for a long time because there were secret societies which
[1:38:35.100 --> 1:38:42.460]  were anti against Rome, and of course Rome, but 2,300 years has ruled Europe, and for
[1:38:42.460 --> 1:38:49.380]  2,300 years, Europe has ruled the world, and so the entire superstructure, what we called
[1:38:49.380 --> 1:38:53.100]  the old world civilization was Europe.
[1:38:53.100 --> 1:38:57.020]  Europe ruled the world, and Rome ruled Europe.
[1:38:57.020 --> 1:39:03.300]  And that really is the history, you have the triple agent British, US and Illuminati, Benjamin
[1:39:03.300 --> 1:39:08.780]  Franklin going over to France, getting the support, so in a way we could say that a branch
[1:39:08.780 --> 1:39:14.660]  of the Illuminati really did want liberty, or they wanted to set up their own new tyranny,
[1:39:14.660 --> 1:39:15.660]  which way was it?
[1:39:15.660 --> 1:39:22.140]  That's right, they wanted their own, and consequently they did set up an order here,
[1:39:22.140 --> 1:39:26.540]  which was the new Atlantis from which their writings say that they believed that they
[1:39:26.540 --> 1:39:33.060]  were setting up a new, established Atlantis on the earth that would become a world dominating
[1:39:33.060 --> 1:39:39.020]  power because it was operating on freedom and liberty, and they knew that that was going
[1:39:39.020 --> 1:39:40.020]  to happen.
[1:39:40.020 --> 1:39:42.420]  They already knew what the end result was going to be.
[1:39:42.420 --> 1:39:43.860]  What about the goddess Columbia?
[1:39:43.860 --> 1:39:51.860]  Yes, well I was going to say, but at the same time that the Illuminati Masonic orders that
[1:39:51.860 --> 1:40:00.940]  were anti against the rule of Europe by Rome saw America as a fertile ground for a new
[1:40:00.940 --> 1:40:08.260]  revolutionary movement in the world, at the same time the Vatican and Rome realized what
[1:40:08.260 --> 1:40:13.260]  was going on, so they came around the back door, as they normally do, they came in the
[1:40:13.260 --> 1:40:20.500]  back door through Mexico and began to work on the west coast with what is called missions.
[1:40:20.500 --> 1:40:26.100]  They have Catholic missions and the Vatican missions, and of course out here in California,
[1:40:26.100 --> 1:40:28.180]  we have nothing but missions everywhere.
[1:40:28.180 --> 1:40:37.740]  Well the word mission, look it up in all dictionaries, it means it's a military term, it's a military
[1:40:37.740 --> 1:40:45.980]  term, a mission, so when you go to the Catholic mission in California, word mission is a military
[1:40:45.980 --> 1:40:48.020]  term.
[1:40:48.020 --> 1:40:52.540]  And this is exactly what's going on right now with opening the borders to Mexico.
[1:40:52.540 --> 1:41:02.820]  There was a big celebration in Florida sponsored by the Roman Catholic Church sponsored a big
[1:41:02.820 --> 1:41:09.140]  operation, a big celebration of which Jeb Bush attended, and it was sponsored by the Knights
[1:41:09.140 --> 1:41:16.660]  of Malta celebrating the opening of the borders for the Mexican borders.
[1:41:16.660 --> 1:41:21.340]  And they've got pictures, they've got pictures of all the Cardinals and priests all dancing
[1:41:21.340 --> 1:41:29.100]  around, cheering with Mexican flags, waving Mexican flags, it's high crimes and treason
[1:41:29.100 --> 1:41:32.140]  against the American Republic.
[1:41:32.140 --> 1:41:38.860]  The Republic is being destroyed by European secret societies operating under Rome and
[1:41:38.860 --> 1:41:40.940]  nobody seems to know anything about it.
[1:41:40.940 --> 1:41:44.740]  I totally agree with you now, since you brought up Rome, let's get into that and to tell the
[1:41:44.740 --> 1:41:48.060]  Jesuits because we talk about the founding of this country.
[1:41:48.060 --> 1:41:52.380]  To be clear, the Roman Catholic Church at that time was dominated by the same mystery
[1:41:52.380 --> 1:41:58.020]  school, so it's two different subcults fighting with each other, a kind of spinoff of the
[1:41:58.020 --> 1:42:03.580]  main cult wanting to set up its own new cult, but with some different rules, A, would you
[1:42:03.580 --> 1:42:11.300]  agree with that statement and then B, then now, because yes, it's true, the Catholic
[1:42:11.300 --> 1:42:15.660]  Church today is bragging about the Laricon Quista, they're helping push it, help teach
[1:42:15.660 --> 1:42:19.660]  it in the schools, they want to bring down the United States, I'm not bashing Catholic
[1:42:19.660 --> 1:42:23.940]  people, again, just like the Protestants are controlled, the point is that are you saying
[1:42:23.940 --> 1:42:27.220]  there's still a fissure between this group?
[1:42:27.220 --> 1:42:32.740]  Yes, I think so, because this always has been, even in the mob, even the mob families back
[1:42:32.740 --> 1:42:40.060]  east, there's always been differences of opinion and problems with territorial rights and so
[1:42:40.060 --> 1:42:44.420]  even in gangs, you know, the crypts and the bloods, they're always fighting over who's
[1:42:44.420 --> 1:42:47.420]  going to eat America up, who's going to have us.
[1:42:47.420 --> 1:42:48.420]  The spoils.
[1:42:48.420 --> 1:42:55.420]  Yeah, spoils, Americans, you know, good people never get organized, only criminals get organized.
[1:42:55.420 --> 1:42:59.820]  Criminals are always organized, that's why they're always superior, because they get
[1:42:59.820 --> 1:43:06.900]  organized and they think and they have intelligence organizations and they operate in the dark
[1:43:06.900 --> 1:43:10.300]  and they are very, very intelligent.
[1:43:10.300 --> 1:43:11.300]  And they're ruthless, they're ruthless.
[1:43:11.300 --> 1:43:12.300]  Totally ruthless.
[1:43:12.300 --> 1:43:16.540]  Yeah, and then now they've bred us to be a bunch of mindless saps that can't even read
[1:43:16.540 --> 1:43:19.220]  and don't think that there's evil, so we're wide open to it.
[1:43:19.220 --> 1:43:20.220]  The devil's greatest trick.
[1:43:20.220 --> 1:43:26.900]  Now I want to go back, because I want to stay on Rome and all these issues, let's expand
[1:43:26.900 --> 1:43:34.580]  on that, because I'm glad you brought that up, go back over the basic cults that took
[1:43:34.580 --> 1:43:38.220]  over Christianity, what they did when they set it up.
[1:43:38.220 --> 1:43:44.300]  And then from that point out, I want to talk about the different subdivisions from your
[1:43:44.300 --> 1:43:50.020]  deep study of what the new orders divided into up until the European Union, with Tony
[1:43:50.020 --> 1:43:54.020]  Blair converting to Catholicism, because they're saying you've got to be Catholic to
[1:43:54.020 --> 1:43:57.020]  be the head of Europe, preparing him for the EU presidency.
[1:43:57.020 --> 1:43:59.620]  Well, that's exactly right.
[1:43:59.620 --> 1:44:05.900]  Like it, logic alone would tell you that what area of the earth has dominated the globe
[1:44:05.900 --> 1:44:09.460]  for over 2,000 years, if it's not Europe.
[1:44:09.460 --> 1:44:12.740]  Europe has dominated the entire world.
[1:44:12.740 --> 1:44:18.260]  And who has dominated Europe, if it wasn't Rome under the Caesars, and then during the
[1:44:18.260 --> 1:44:21.820]  Middle Ages and the Dark Ages and the Medieval times.
[1:44:21.820 --> 1:44:23.940]  And now they have the Swiss as their bank, yeah.
[1:44:23.940 --> 1:44:27.780]  Precisely, that's why the Pope has a Swiss guard.
[1:44:27.780 --> 1:44:31.580]  And they're guarding the boss.
[1:44:31.580 --> 1:44:34.260]  That's why you have a Swiss guard at the Vatican.
[1:44:34.260 --> 1:44:42.300]  I mean, it's an incredible array of darkness and conspiratorial stuff that's been going
[1:44:42.300 --> 1:44:43.300]  on.
[1:44:43.300 --> 1:44:49.740]  And, you know, as far as I'm concerned, it's so overwhelming in your face when you actually
[1:44:49.740 --> 1:44:57.340]  sit in a library and begin to read history and read the beginnings of the secret societies
[1:44:57.340 --> 1:45:04.300]  operating like the Knights of Malta, operating in with total impunity.
[1:45:04.300 --> 1:45:07.820]  They don't have any problem doing anything in this country.
[1:45:07.820 --> 1:45:12.340]  Now, you see Rome going after the Jesuits at one point, and the Knights of Malta from
[1:45:12.340 --> 1:45:13.340]  your study.
[1:45:13.340 --> 1:45:15.060]  Can you divide up those groups?
[1:45:15.060 --> 1:45:17.500]  I mean, is that one unified group or what's happening?
[1:45:17.500 --> 1:45:20.380]  As far as I'm concerned, it is all one group.
[1:45:20.380 --> 1:45:27.140]  But as I said, in any organized criminal enterprise on a worldwide scale, there's going to be
[1:45:27.140 --> 1:45:28.140]  infighting inside.
[1:45:28.140 --> 1:45:31.180]  I mean, there always has been.
[1:45:31.180 --> 1:45:36.220]  Even in the old Chicago mob, there was always killings on the street between the different
[1:45:36.220 --> 1:45:37.220]  factors.
[1:45:37.220 --> 1:45:38.620]  Yeah, the St. Valentine's Day Massacre.
[1:45:38.620 --> 1:45:39.620]  Yeah, yeah.
[1:45:39.620 --> 1:45:42.860]  But it's them feeding on themselves.
[1:45:42.860 --> 1:45:48.420]  Now after they've fed on each other and killed each other, then they turn on the public.
[1:45:48.420 --> 1:45:55.500]  So it's a mad rush for control and ownership of the human race, and that's a whole story
[1:45:55.500 --> 1:46:02.740]  in itself, how the human race is lawfully and legally set up to be owned, how our bodies
[1:46:02.740 --> 1:46:06.060]  are actually owned on the spot market, and how our children...
[1:46:06.060 --> 1:46:08.740]  Well, they call it human resources.
[1:46:08.740 --> 1:46:10.060]  That's exactly right.
[1:46:10.060 --> 1:46:16.260]  If you don't go to employment office, you go to a human resource, just like tin and iron
[1:46:16.260 --> 1:46:17.780]  and rubber and oil.
[1:46:17.780 --> 1:46:18.780]  It's a resource.
[1:46:18.780 --> 1:46:23.300]  It seems they have a rule, though, to always tell you what they're doing and give you a
[1:46:23.300 --> 1:46:26.060]  chance to fight back against them.
[1:46:26.060 --> 1:46:28.860]  How does that feed into their esoteric rules?
[1:46:28.860 --> 1:46:31.140]  Well, that's true.
[1:46:31.140 --> 1:46:35.580]  There is a lot there that all you need to do is just go to a library and read it.
[1:46:35.580 --> 1:46:37.140]  It's all right there.
[1:46:37.140 --> 1:46:40.420]  You can go on the web and go to...
[1:46:40.420 --> 1:46:41.420]  Just type in...
[1:46:41.420 --> 1:46:49.900]  Go to Google and just type in commerce game, and there's a lot of material on how commerce
[1:46:49.900 --> 1:46:53.060]  actually, in fact, works.
[1:46:53.060 --> 1:46:54.060]  And it doesn't work.
[1:46:54.060 --> 1:46:56.420]  Nothing works the way you think it does.
[1:46:56.420 --> 1:47:00.940]  Banks, by law, are not allowed to loan money ever.
[1:47:00.940 --> 1:47:04.020]  That is an absolute law.
[1:47:04.020 --> 1:47:08.220]  Banks cannot ever loan money, because think about it.
[1:47:08.220 --> 1:47:14.100]  If you go and put $10,000 into a bank, and then 20 minutes later I walk in and borrow
[1:47:14.100 --> 1:47:20.940]  $20,000 to buy a new car, I just took your money to buy my new car.
[1:47:20.940 --> 1:47:22.420]  Suppose I don't pay it back.
[1:47:22.420 --> 1:47:28.380]  Now you are out $20,000, because I spent it on my car that I'm not going to pay for.
[1:47:28.380 --> 1:47:30.980]  So banks cannot loan money.
[1:47:30.980 --> 1:47:32.980]  They have never loaned money.
[1:47:32.980 --> 1:47:34.660]  They loan letters of credit.
[1:47:34.660 --> 1:47:37.460]  Oh, well, that's different.
[1:47:37.460 --> 1:47:39.220]  And what is the credit based on?
[1:47:39.220 --> 1:47:46.300]  It is based on you, the slaves, and it's basically an imperial mark saying you've got this credit.
[1:47:46.300 --> 1:47:47.300]  That's right.
[1:47:47.300 --> 1:47:48.300]  Exactly.
[1:47:48.300 --> 1:47:54.500]  It's not giving you anything, and once you understand the way a bank works, then you
[1:47:54.500 --> 1:47:59.500]  can say, oh, I see how this stuff works, now I see.
[1:47:59.500 --> 1:48:03.340]  But most people have no idea in the world why they go to court.
[1:48:03.340 --> 1:48:05.700]  You only play basketball and tennis on a court.
[1:48:05.700 --> 1:48:09.500]  Yeah, let's get into the court, because I talk to lawyers and they admit all this.
[1:48:09.500 --> 1:48:11.100]  They pray to the judge.
[1:48:11.100 --> 1:48:14.460]  It's all a Saturn ritual.
[1:48:14.460 --> 1:48:15.740]  And the judges even know this.
[1:48:15.740 --> 1:48:17.140]  This is a temple.
[1:48:17.140 --> 1:48:21.340]  That's why the courthouse and the Supreme Court is a temple, tell me.
[1:48:21.340 --> 1:48:22.340]  It is.
[1:48:22.340 --> 1:48:24.340]  I mean, they say it is.
[1:48:24.340 --> 1:48:26.820]  I mean, even in their record, they talk about it.
[1:48:26.820 --> 1:48:33.780]  You know, I don't even know where to start, because I've been looking at this for 48 years.
[1:48:33.780 --> 1:48:38.900]  I don't even know where to start, because there is so much to be said about how people
[1:48:38.900 --> 1:48:45.140]  are being manipulated and exploited in their ignorance and have no idea in the world what's
[1:48:45.140 --> 1:48:46.140]  going on.
[1:48:46.140 --> 1:48:50.820]  For instance, there's two of everything in our country.
[1:48:50.820 --> 1:48:52.460]  There's not 50 states.
[1:48:52.460 --> 1:48:56.940]  There's 100 states in America, not 50.
[1:48:56.940 --> 1:49:00.780]  And people talk about the United States as one nation indivisible.
[1:49:00.780 --> 1:49:08.300]  The United States of America is not one nation, and it is not indivisible, because America
[1:49:08.300 --> 1:49:09.980]  is not one nation.
[1:49:09.980 --> 1:49:12.380]  It is 50 different nations.
[1:49:12.380 --> 1:49:18.740]  Each state is a sovereign entity of its own, and consequently, you can do things in one
[1:49:18.740 --> 1:49:21.260]  state that you can't do in another.
[1:49:21.260 --> 1:49:23.540]  So we're not one nation indivisible.
[1:49:23.540 --> 1:49:25.820]  No, not at all.
[1:49:25.820 --> 1:49:29.580]  There are 50 different nations, and each one has their own government.
[1:49:29.580 --> 1:49:34.740]  And then we have the founders doing that saying that would keep tyranny from overrunning it,
[1:49:34.740 --> 1:49:39.380]  and now who we are, 230 something years later, finally the feds are federalizing everything.
[1:49:39.380 --> 1:49:40.380]  Everything.
[1:49:40.380 --> 1:49:41.380]  Feds have come in.
[1:49:41.380 --> 1:49:47.460]  Look, the federal government is like if you buy a condo in a building.
[1:49:47.460 --> 1:49:52.580]  You own your own apartment or condo in the building, but there are other people who own
[1:49:52.580 --> 1:49:57.060]  their condos in the building, so you have to live with other people.
[1:49:57.060 --> 1:50:02.340]  So therefore, you get together and you decide who's going to be in charge of taking the
[1:50:02.340 --> 1:50:07.420]  trash out for everyone, who's going to be in charge of cleaning the pool for everyone.
[1:50:07.420 --> 1:50:11.500]  So everybody chips in a few dollars at each month to pay for...
[1:50:11.500 --> 1:50:13.540]  Yeah, the federal government is the home owning association.
[1:50:13.540 --> 1:50:16.140]  Yes, that's exactly right.
[1:50:16.140 --> 1:50:19.900]  And therefore, but now the people who have been appointed by...
[1:50:19.900 --> 1:50:22.740]  They're in your bedroom eating out of your refrigerator.
[1:50:22.740 --> 1:50:23.740]  That's it.
[1:50:23.740 --> 1:50:28.700]  Telling you what you can do, what you can do, when in point of fact, we hired them.
[1:50:28.700 --> 1:50:29.700]  Amazing.
[1:50:29.700 --> 1:50:34.380]  Jordan Maxwell, let's talk more about the court, the robes, praying to the court, Roman civil
[1:50:34.380 --> 1:50:39.020]  law versus common law, what we're being converted to, and then the globalist master plan, the
[1:50:39.020 --> 1:50:41.260]  mutation of the human population.

[1:51:01.580 --> 1:51:06.340]  sugar, spikes, and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of

[1:51:50.940 --> 1:51:52.860]  Our beloved republic is on her knees.
[1:51:52.860 --> 1:51:57.380]  The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide, but in Liberty's darkest
[1:51:57.380 --> 1:51:58.940]  hour there is hope.
[1:51:58.940 --> 1:52:01.740]  For the first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[1:52:01.740 --> 1:52:06.220]  It is essential that patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding of the New
[1:52:06.220 --> 1:52:07.740]  World Order master plan.
[1:52:07.740 --> 1:52:11.980]  We have a short time frame to fully awaken and energize the people to meet this threat.

[1:52:54.060 --> 1:52:58.780]  Last month, Ready Reserve Foods stated that by fall, food would be in short supply and
[1:52:58.780 --> 1:53:02.580]  the government would be forced to impose controls on food and food distribution because
[1:53:02.580 --> 1:53:04.580]  of civil unrest and panic.
[1:53:04.580 --> 1:53:09.100]  Well, the floods in the heartland of America have all but assured this will happen.
[1:53:09.100 --> 1:53:14.300]  It is estimated that 5 million acres of farmland will not be producing over 700 million bushels
[1:53:14.300 --> 1:53:15.940]  of corn alone.
[1:53:15.940 --> 1:53:20.340]  If you have ever thought about storing food, now is the time to do so.

[1:53:25.420 --> 1:53:31.340]  Larry Matlak, President of the American Agriculture Movement, stated on June 6, that the USDA has
[1:53:31.340 --> 1:53:35.660]  only enough wheat stored to make one half of a loaf of bread for every American.

[1:54:39.100 --> 1:54:45.500]  The secret brotherhood that wages war against freedom
[1:54:45.500 --> 1:54:50.980]  controls every major organization, every ancient organization.
[1:54:50.980 --> 1:54:56.300]  Their gang symbols are all around us, from Starbucks coffee to the bikers wearing the
[1:54:56.300 --> 1:54:59.220]  iron cross.
[1:54:59.220 --> 1:55:01.740]  The symbols mean something.
[1:55:01.740 --> 1:55:05.580]  The Illuminati, they believe that these symbols resonate a power.
[1:55:05.580 --> 1:55:10.340]  They believe they bring in, that it channels in a spiritual force.
[1:55:10.340 --> 1:55:12.700]  And they do have the power, you have to ask, is it real?
[1:55:12.700 --> 1:55:15.700]  Regardless, they believe it is.
[1:55:15.700 --> 1:55:18.700]  Jordan Maxwell, one of the foremost experts on this subject, JordanMaxwell.com is our guest.
[1:55:18.700 --> 1:55:20.580]  Into the next hour, great to have him on with us.
[1:55:20.580 --> 1:55:22.180]  I'm on his site.
[1:55:22.180 --> 1:55:29.100]  I'm in a section on religion, hidden roots of religion, and we're going to get into words
[1:55:29.100 --> 1:55:30.100]  to search.
[1:55:30.100 --> 1:55:33.340]  But I'm looking at the iron cross, the Knights Templar.
[1:55:33.340 --> 1:55:41.540]  I'm looking at these symbols also being used in the United States as well.
[1:55:41.540 --> 1:55:43.820]  What does that symbol mean when we see the iron cross?
[1:55:43.820 --> 1:55:52.380]  Well, that's interesting, you know, it's used everywhere, and most people do not realize
[1:55:52.380 --> 1:55:55.060]  what the iron cross meant, where it comes from.
[1:55:55.060 --> 1:56:02.620]  It's associated with very powerful dark secret societies in Europe, especially in Germany,
[1:56:02.620 --> 1:56:12.940]  and how the Vatican bestows, when the Vatican bestows, some kind of a, what am I trying
[1:56:12.940 --> 1:56:18.300]  to say, some kind of an award on politicians, as always, the iron cross.
[1:56:18.300 --> 1:56:22.740]  The iron cross was used by Nazi Germany, Adolf Hitler.
[1:56:22.740 --> 1:56:28.980]  It's used by the Knights of Malta, a secret society operating within the Vatican, which
[1:56:28.980 --> 1:56:36.860]  also gave us, the Knights of Malta are responsible for giving to America, the CIA, CIA is a Knights
[1:56:36.860 --> 1:56:37.860]  of Malta operation.
[1:56:37.860 --> 1:56:41.900]  So, the Knights of Malta, the Knights of Malta, you think are more powerful than Jesuits,
[1:56:41.900 --> 1:56:42.900]  so the same.
[1:56:42.900 --> 1:56:47.780]  Well, I think that they are working kind of with the Jesuits, maybe even the Jesuits
[1:56:47.780 --> 1:56:52.420]  are the brains behind Knights of Malta, it's very difficult to know, even when you're
[1:56:52.420 --> 1:56:57.500]  in those secret societies, it's hard to tell, you know, who the bosses are.
[1:56:57.500 --> 1:57:00.780]  It's another problem is that I've always talked about this and always had guests on
[1:57:00.780 --> 1:57:05.340]  about it, and then you've got other nuts out there who just make up wild claims, crazy
[1:57:05.340 --> 1:57:09.540]  things, and then you know, and then when somebody calls you a Jesuit or something, I'm not
[1:57:09.540 --> 1:57:14.580]  even Catholic, and then it's kind of hard to cover their, their research when they believe
[1:57:14.580 --> 1:57:19.620]  in flying saucers, and that the earth is the center of the universe, I mean, then here
[1:57:19.620 --> 1:57:23.060]  I've got you and countless others on, they'll still say I never talked about it, never
[1:57:23.060 --> 1:57:26.820]  discussed it, no matter how many guests a week I have on the subject, and it'll never
[1:57:26.820 --> 1:57:30.940]  end, because, but, but, but you're a credible researcher because we're covering now, now,
[1:57:30.940 --> 1:57:36.820]  now the, the, the Iron Cross is associated with Bacchus, is it not, and that's the Roman
[1:57:36.820 --> 1:57:37.820]  Devil.
[1:57:37.820 --> 1:57:42.940]  Well, and it's also associated with the old Sumerian, the ancient Sumerians used the
[1:57:42.940 --> 1:57:43.940]  same symbol.
[1:57:43.940 --> 1:57:50.300]  If you, if you go on my website, anywhere, anyone listening, just go on my website and
[1:57:50.300 --> 1:57:57.580]  you will see at the top of the page a button saying research, or, or there's a box, if
[1:57:57.580 --> 1:58:02.180]  you scroll down just a little bit, you'll see a box that says general research.
[1:58:02.180 --> 1:58:06.700]  That's the same thing, go to that, and it will take you to a, a group of boxes, and
[1:58:06.700 --> 1:58:12.220]  each one's filled with all kinds of different kind of research, and so the one we're on
[1:58:12.220 --> 1:58:17.100]  right now is called hidden roots of religion, and a lot of people ask me about, well, what
[1:58:17.100 --> 1:58:22.700]  about this, what about that, but the three books that are on my website, uh, on the home
[1:58:22.700 --> 1:58:23.700]  page are-
[1:58:23.700 --> 1:58:26.580]  Tell you what, stay there, stay there, we gotta break, we're gonna come back and talk
[1:58:26.580 --> 1:58:32.940]  about Bacchus, and a lot more, stay with us.

[2:00:00.540 --> 2:00:14.940]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network, and now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[2:00:14.940 --> 2:00:19.500]  Underneath the iron cross on the swastika, on Jordan Maxwell's website, he has Bacchus,
[2:00:19.500 --> 2:00:28.780]  he's not prejudice, he hangs out at synagogues too, that's the horned devil, and then he's
[2:00:28.780 --> 2:00:35.060]  got Bacchus is at home here on the monument in T.B.N.'s courtyard, and then you've got
[2:00:35.060 --> 2:00:40.940]  Bacchus all over, different monuments all over the world, I saw Bacchus' all over, every
[2:00:40.940 --> 2:00:45.700]  major government building, the Supreme Court, you name it, and it's all done as guardians,
[2:00:45.700 --> 2:00:50.140]  they're always at the corners of the buildings, continue, I mean, why do you have Bacchus on
[2:00:50.140 --> 2:00:52.020]  this page about the Nazis, Jordan?
[2:00:52.020 --> 2:00:58.460]  Well, it's not connected to the Nazis as such, it's just one of each article, and I put
[2:00:58.460 --> 2:01:03.100]  three or four articles per page, sometimes I only put two, depending on how long they
[2:01:03.100 --> 2:01:04.100]  are.
[2:01:04.100 --> 2:01:06.940]  Well, I know the Nazi Germans did put Bacchus on a lot of stuff.
[2:01:06.940 --> 2:01:10.180]  Oh, yeah, of course they did, of course they did.
[2:01:10.180 --> 2:01:11.180]  Is he a friendly guy?
[2:01:11.180 --> 2:01:13.020]  Why do they like him so much?
[2:01:13.020 --> 2:01:20.500]  Well Bacchus has been, he's the god of wine, and drinking alcohol, and merry making, and
[2:01:20.500 --> 2:01:26.260]  all kinds of interesting stuff, you can go back to any good reference book, and just,
[2:01:26.260 --> 2:01:29.940]  as a matter of fact, I think I've got footnotes, and that's something I want to tell everybody,
[2:01:29.940 --> 2:01:36.140]  on all the boxes, all the materials and things you're reading, they're almost always footnotes.
[2:01:36.140 --> 2:01:41.300]  Hit the button, says footnote, and it will take you to reference works on that subject,
[2:01:41.300 --> 2:01:43.100]  or you can do research on it yourself.
[2:01:43.100 --> 2:01:47.780]  Well, here's an example, I mean, the Nazis did invent wearing the skull and crossbones,
[2:01:47.780 --> 2:01:51.660]  they'd done that in the Teutonic nights for close to a thousand years.
[2:01:51.660 --> 2:01:55.860]  Why do they worship the symbol of the skull and crossbones, normally missing the bottom
[2:01:55.860 --> 2:01:56.860]  mandible?
[2:01:56.860 --> 2:02:02.580]  Well, you know, there's all kinds of reasons that have been given.
[2:02:02.580 --> 2:02:07.740]  Skull and crossbones, as you said, was used by the Knights of the Caribbean, of the Knights
[2:02:07.740 --> 2:02:13.100]  of Malta, and some of the Masonic orders that were, the European Roman Masonic orders that
[2:02:13.100 --> 2:02:18.060]  we call pirates of the Caribbean, that's why the pirates always had the, what is called
[2:02:18.060 --> 2:02:24.340]  the Jolly Roger, the black flag, you know, the black was always the Saturnian color,
[2:02:24.340 --> 2:02:29.620]  it represented death, and so the black flag with the skull and crossbones was the symbol
[2:02:29.620 --> 2:02:33.100]  for what we call the pirates of the Caribbean.
[2:02:33.100 --> 2:02:39.460]  Well, the pirates of the Caribbean were the old Knights Templars who not only did business
[2:02:39.460 --> 2:02:45.940]  all over the world on the oceans, but they even stole from governments and private investors
[2:02:45.940 --> 2:02:52.380]  and, you know, different ships on the high seas, they would raid these ships, and that
[2:02:52.380 --> 2:02:57.140]  makes their carcass even bigger, you know, they're making a lot of money, they're doing
[2:02:57.140 --> 2:03:01.620]  it with business, or they'll just rob you, one of the two, and they're still doing that.
[2:03:01.620 --> 2:03:05.380]  All over the world, the bankers are still robbing the people, ripping them off, putting
[2:03:05.380 --> 2:03:09.900]  it in the banks, and using the same symbols that they've always used, the way they've
[2:03:09.900 --> 2:03:12.140]  always done it.
[2:03:12.140 --> 2:03:18.340]  So, you know, the more we change, the more we stay the same.
[2:03:18.340 --> 2:03:23.460]  The same stuff that's been going on for a thousand years, still going on today, but
[2:03:23.460 --> 2:03:26.660]  now they've made it into a real business now.
[2:03:26.660 --> 2:03:31.500]  A lot of the things I talk about, especially in relation to what we're talking about now,
[2:03:31.500 --> 2:03:38.140]  the occult societies, there's an excellent book which you cannot find anywhere, since
[2:03:38.140 --> 2:03:44.060]  it's no longer printed, it's no longer being sold anywhere, and you can't even find it,
[2:03:44.060 --> 2:03:49.420]  and if you do, it's going to be $500-$1,000 a copy, but I've looked for it, and I can't
[2:03:49.420 --> 2:03:50.420]  find it.
[2:03:50.420 --> 2:03:57.860]  I have an e-book on my home page, just called Occult Theocracy, which is all of the secret
[2:03:57.860 --> 2:04:03.620]  societies for eternal orders, all the ancient cults of the world, where they came from,
[2:04:03.620 --> 2:04:09.820]  what they owe, who started them, just general information on all kinds of secret orders
[2:04:09.820 --> 2:04:12.140]  and societies and how they're connected.
[2:04:12.140 --> 2:04:16.220]  Well, Jordan, since we're doing radio right now, and I'm sure folks will go and visit
[2:04:16.220 --> 2:04:20.340]  all that, and they can read along, I want to go from the top of the pyramid from your
[2:04:20.340 --> 2:04:25.900]  deep research, who's at the very top, and kind of do a quick tour of the next segment
[2:04:25.900 --> 2:04:29.300]  throughout that occult theocracy, okay?
[2:04:29.300 --> 2:04:35.460]  Also, we're going to go ahead for infowars.com listeners and prismplanet.tv viewers.
[2:04:35.460 --> 2:04:36.860]  We're streaming live video right now.
[2:04:36.860 --> 2:04:40.420]  We're going to be talking to Jordan behind the breaks as well, it's too important to
[2:04:40.420 --> 2:04:41.420]  waste any time.
[2:04:41.420 --> 2:04:42.420]  So, here we go.
[2:04:42.420 --> 2:05:12.380]  We'll keep talking to Jordan right now.
[2:05:12.420 --> 2:05:34.780]  We're going to be talking to Jordan behind the breaks as well, it's too important to
[2:05:34.780 --> 2:05:47.820]  waste any time.
[2:05:47.820 --> 2:05:51.940]  If your body isn't feeling too well these days, you're going to start taking this hemp,
[2:05:51.940 --> 2:05:57.860]  I say, go to hempusa.org.
[2:05:57.860 --> 2:06:02.620]  You may not like what I'm about to say, but you know I'm going to say it anyway.
[2:06:02.620 --> 2:06:07.500]  The government doesn't want the best for you, they keep you down, they keep you blue, they
[2:06:07.500 --> 2:06:12.440]  starve your body for all its nutrients.
[2:06:12.440 --> 2:06:17.100]  They won't let you grow industrial hemp, it really doesn't make any kind of sense when
[2:06:17.100 --> 2:06:22.060]  it's so healthy for the world and useful for you, my friends.
[2:06:22.060 --> 2:06:31.580]  I hope Mr. Bush will hear this song for the heart of America wants this one, go to hempusa.org.
[2:06:31.580 --> 2:06:41.060]  If you're a true Thurian anarchist or renegade, the only things that God has made, go to hempusa.org.
[2:06:41.060 --> 2:06:47.860]  We offer free shipping anywhere in the states, go to hempusa.org.
[2:06:47.860 --> 2:06:51.980]  Hi neighbor, no matter when the time comes to survive on our food supply, every single
[2:06:51.980 --> 2:06:54.980]  one of us who have prepared will have two regrets.
[2:06:54.980 --> 2:06:59.100]  Even those who haven't wasted a single penny on Christmas, birthdays and vacations in order
[2:06:59.100 --> 2:07:01.480]  to store all the food possible.
[2:07:01.480 --> 2:07:05.380]  Even those who have sold stuff and taken on part-time jobs to buy food.
[2:07:05.380 --> 2:07:09.100]  Even those who have traded their gold while it will still buy food.
[2:07:09.100 --> 2:07:13.220]  Yes, we will have been called stupid, crazy and foolish.
[2:07:13.220 --> 2:07:17.340]  When folks won't be able to afford food and there won't be any food for any amount of
[2:07:17.340 --> 2:07:18.420]  money.
[2:07:18.420 --> 2:07:21.060]  We will still have two regrets.
[2:07:21.060 --> 2:07:25.060]  We will regret that we didn't get more serious about more food sooner.
[2:07:25.060 --> 2:07:28.700]  We will deeply regret that we didn't get enough food.
[2:07:28.700 --> 2:07:33.220]  Putting off emergency food preparations to celebrate the holidays will be the most dangerous
[2:07:33.220 --> 2:07:36.260]  decision that some of us will ever make.
[2:07:36.260 --> 2:07:43.180]  Call 800-409-5633 on the web, efoodsdirect.com.
[2:07:43.180 --> 2:07:45.180]  800-409-5633.
[2:07:45.180 --> 2:07:51.380]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[2:07:51.380 --> 2:07:54.380]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[2:07:54.380 --> 2:07:59.060]  Well, I'm going to try to keep Jordan five minutes to the next hour, but then we have
[2:07:59.060 --> 2:08:00.060]  State Rep.
[2:08:00.060 --> 2:08:05.580]  Charles Key exposing up to the city as an inside job bombing and then they pass resolution
[2:08:05.580 --> 2:08:09.260]  to fight the New World Order at the state level to basically pull out of the union and
[2:08:09.260 --> 2:08:11.420]  the New World Order continues to expand.
[2:08:11.420 --> 2:08:13.460]  That is coming up in about an hour.
[2:08:13.460 --> 2:08:19.940]  Man, time has really flown by with Jordan Maxwell.
[2:08:19.940 --> 2:08:23.580]  Jordan again is a premonit researcher into the core documents of the elite and what
[2:08:23.580 --> 2:08:25.140]  makes them tick.
[2:08:25.140 --> 2:08:31.660]  Jordan, give us a tour of the basic history of where all this really starts.
[2:08:31.660 --> 2:08:35.180]  As best you can tell, have they been passing on knowledge?
[2:08:35.180 --> 2:08:40.580]  Do they claim they have the secrets of the pyramids in Atlantis and all this?
[2:08:40.580 --> 2:08:43.140]  Or is that fable?
[2:08:43.140 --> 2:08:46.460]  How much power do they really have?
[2:08:46.460 --> 2:08:51.140]  You talk about how their main goal, and now they admit this, is to create two species
[2:08:51.140 --> 2:08:56.540]  of humanoid, dumb us down, exterminate most of us, and I'm just throwing out the basics
[2:08:56.540 --> 2:09:01.380]  here because broad strokes here in the time we have, and then for the behind the scenes
[2:09:01.380 --> 2:09:05.860]  viewers at PrismPlanet.tv, I want to continue that discussion afterwards after you finish
[2:09:05.860 --> 2:09:09.580]  that with, you believe the Roman Catholic Church is at the very top, it didn't mean
[2:09:09.580 --> 2:09:14.700]  the Roman Catholic adherence to the people, but that system dominating Europe and that
[2:09:14.700 --> 2:09:22.740]  it's at war with the Knights Templars who went to Germany, who went from there into
[2:09:22.740 --> 2:09:27.900]  Scotland and then into the United States, are those two, the Anglo-American establishment,
[2:09:27.900 --> 2:09:29.740]  really waging war with Europe?
[2:09:29.740 --> 2:09:34.100]  Or why on the surface does it look like they're all working together?
[2:09:34.100 --> 2:09:38.380]  Or is that what the New World Order is, was the Knights Templars claiming they were going
[2:09:38.380 --> 2:09:43.700]  to build a new order, but now it's really just a new order that's run by the Vatican?
[2:09:43.700 --> 2:09:48.540]  Again, this is where all the evidence points, that's why we're here discussing it.
[2:09:48.540 --> 2:09:53.100]  It doesn't matter if it's TBN with all their weird statues or Protestants, Catholics, it's
[2:09:53.100 --> 2:09:57.180]  all run by the New World Order, but Jordan was saying there could be some splits there,
[2:09:57.180 --> 2:10:01.020]  so I want to walk through that with his expertise, but Jordan, that's a long-winded question
[2:10:01.020 --> 2:10:02.020]  there.
[2:10:02.020 --> 2:10:06.580]  Try to tackle that, scanning the pyramid, I mean, let's say you had 10 minutes to talk
[2:10:06.580 --> 2:10:11.780]  to the world about the structure of it, who they are, why it's important to know.
[2:10:11.780 --> 2:10:12.780]  Tell us.
[2:10:12.780 --> 2:10:21.100]  Well, I think that it's all one ball of wax, it's all one operation that goes back thousands
[2:10:21.100 --> 2:10:28.700]  of years into the ancient past, a religio-political establishment on the earth, and the ancient
[2:10:28.700 --> 2:10:36.180]  prehistoric world, the kings were always not only head of government and law, but they
[2:10:36.180 --> 2:10:42.260]  also represented the connection between mankind, their followers, and God.
[2:10:42.260 --> 2:10:47.700]  So consequently, they held absolute sovereign power.
[2:10:47.700 --> 2:10:54.180]  And I have always understood that kingships and princes is nothing more than the crypts
[2:10:54.180 --> 2:11:03.300]  and the bloods, people who have taken for themselves the idea that they are royalty.
[2:11:03.300 --> 2:11:09.460]  You've got to be out of your mind not to question who said that you are royal.
[2:11:09.460 --> 2:11:15.980]  I mean, in America, nobody likes to be around somebody who is pompous and arrogant and better
[2:11:15.980 --> 2:11:17.980]  than anybody else.
[2:11:17.980 --> 2:11:23.460]  Nobody likes to be around those people because everybody realizes those people live in a dream
[2:11:23.460 --> 2:11:30.460]  world who treat you and mistreat you and look down on you and snob you.
[2:11:30.460 --> 2:11:37.180]  People know that that's just a fake and that they're no better than anybody else.
[2:11:37.180 --> 2:11:40.980]  So we naturally feel that about people who have snobbed.
[2:11:40.980 --> 2:11:46.140]  However, if it's the Holy Father or the Queen Mum, now that's different.
[2:11:46.140 --> 2:11:52.780]  We will get on our knees and shake and slobber on ourselves because we are, are, be able
[2:11:52.780 --> 2:11:59.540]  to see the Holy Father or we'll be able to see Queen Mum or Prince Charles will struggle
[2:11:59.540 --> 2:12:06.220]  and pay whatever we have to to get in line to see Prince Charles drive by, when in point
[2:12:06.220 --> 2:12:13.020]  to fact the British royalty, Vatican royalty, royalty all over Europe is nothing but the
[2:12:13.020 --> 2:12:19.700]  crypts and the bloods, gangs, gangs who have murdered and killed and destroyed the freedom
[2:12:19.700 --> 2:12:25.180]  of peoples all over the earth and today they are in power.
[2:12:25.180 --> 2:12:26.180]  They're ruthless.
[2:12:26.180 --> 2:12:27.680]  They're murderous.
[2:12:27.680 --> 2:12:34.020]  They are nothing more than gang wars, secret societies, criminal cults, criminal operations.
[2:12:34.020 --> 2:12:35.020]  Wow.
[2:12:35.020 --> 2:12:36.020]  That's just a point.
[2:12:36.020 --> 2:12:40.380]  Whenever I see the low level crypts and bloods and the vatos, they're all calling themselves
[2:12:40.380 --> 2:12:41.860]  Latin kings.
[2:12:41.860 --> 2:12:43.540]  Their symbols are little crowns.
[2:12:43.540 --> 2:12:47.940]  They have secret handshakes and signs and that really is just it.
[2:12:47.940 --> 2:12:48.940]  That's it.
[2:12:48.940 --> 2:12:53.700]  That's the name of the tomb, royalty and holy people at the top, the priests and the holy
[2:12:53.700 --> 2:13:00.260]  ones of all the different religions from the Billy Graham's to the papacy to all the silly
[2:13:00.260 --> 2:13:06.100]  nonsense that's on Christian television with all the preachers who are making 10, 15 million
[2:13:06.100 --> 2:13:13.100]  dollars with their huge enormous churches, it's nothing more than a con job.
[2:13:13.100 --> 2:13:22.220]  It's a con job and people are extraordinarily interested in being lied to, deceived.
[2:13:22.220 --> 2:13:28.980]  Even in the Bible there's a story about Pontius Pilate bringing Jesus to the crowd with Barabbas
[2:13:28.980 --> 2:13:34.020]  and on the one hand he's got Barabbas which everybody knows as a con artist and a murderer
[2:13:34.020 --> 2:13:39.860]  and a thief and then on the other side is Jesus who represents the truth and the light
[2:13:39.860 --> 2:13:46.660]  and it's a metaphoric story where government says to the people, Pontius Pilate, head of
[2:13:46.660 --> 2:13:55.820]  government says to the people, here is Barabbas, a murdering, thieving scumbag and here is
[2:13:55.820 --> 2:14:00.820]  Jesus representing the truth and the light and the scripture says with one voice the
[2:14:00.820 --> 2:14:07.060]  people cried out, give us Barabbas which is translated symbolically to mean when the
[2:14:07.060 --> 2:14:12.660]  people of this world are given an opportunity to know the truth or to crawl on their knees
[2:14:12.660 --> 2:14:19.780]  before their masters who are nothing more than liars, murderers, bloodshedding thieves,
[2:14:19.780 --> 2:14:22.620]  people will always support the masters.
[2:14:22.620 --> 2:14:29.300]  That's what I was going to ask is this morning, it's almost like a spirit, I got criticized
[2:14:29.300 --> 2:14:33.700]  yesterday, somebody sent me a YouTube young guy saying, Alex used to say there was a new
[2:14:33.700 --> 2:14:37.780]  world order, I choose not to believe it, I don't want to believe it, it doesn't exist,
[2:14:37.780 --> 2:14:42.460]  I choose, I heard all these radio shows with callers, I'd flip channels and I'd come into
[2:14:42.460 --> 2:14:47.700]  work and it was other shows saying I don't want to hear bad news anymore, then understand
[2:14:47.700 --> 2:14:51.580]  if you face the bad news and deal with it then you can have a good place to live in and
[2:14:51.580 --> 2:14:56.500]  have more liberty but when you just deny and want to live in denial and want to lie to
[2:14:56.500 --> 2:15:02.060]  yourself you have a horrible world and it's true, a lot of people, they want to be lied
[2:15:02.060 --> 2:15:06.420]  to, they want to be conned, they think it's cute and funny and I don't understand it.
[2:15:06.420 --> 2:15:13.660]  Well, I mean, you know, in a country that is staggering in their economic woes and
[2:15:13.660 --> 2:15:19.180]  economic disabilities in this country, people are crawling on their knees sleeping in their
[2:15:19.180 --> 2:15:28.180]  cars and yet the alcohol industry, smoking industry, television, entertainment, movies
[2:15:28.180 --> 2:15:32.300]  are making a bumper crop, they're making billions.
[2:15:32.300 --> 2:15:33.300]  Why?
[2:15:33.300 --> 2:15:38.420]  Because the people have lost their souls, they have nothing to live for, they have no
[2:15:38.420 --> 2:15:39.420]  clue.
[2:15:39.420 --> 2:15:42.340]  And that was a design, that was a seduction because it's almost like a joke now, I talked
[2:15:42.340 --> 2:15:46.180]  to people on the street and it's like they're getting more retarded by the week.
[2:15:46.180 --> 2:15:47.180]  Without a doubt.
[2:15:47.180 --> 2:15:48.180]  Absolutely.
[2:15:48.180 --> 2:15:49.180]  What's going on?
[2:15:49.180 --> 2:15:53.180]  It's like a mass mutation is taking place before my eyes.
[2:15:53.180 --> 2:15:54.180]  Absolutely.
[2:15:54.180 --> 2:15:59.020]  I'm telling you and it's frightening because I know what the future is going to be.
[2:15:59.020 --> 2:16:00.700]  I already know what's coming.
[2:16:00.700 --> 2:16:06.700]  There's going to be a time very soon when Americans, generally speaking, and the worst
[2:16:06.700 --> 2:16:14.220]  part about it is that the masses will never wake up, they will just become acclimated to
[2:16:14.220 --> 2:16:15.220]  the system.
[2:16:15.220 --> 2:16:18.620]  The government documents, I mean the new thing said you'll be arrested if you're seen hugging
[2:16:18.620 --> 2:16:20.420]  your child or kissing them.
[2:16:20.420 --> 2:16:21.420]  That's right.
[2:16:21.420 --> 2:16:25.100]  I mean so, and the government says we'll be in gray uniforms with shaved heads, basically
[2:16:25.100 --> 2:16:30.140]  lobotomized and that's who's even allowed to live and I see them facing that in rather
[2:16:30.140 --> 2:16:32.300]  quickly the way it's going.
[2:16:32.300 --> 2:16:37.420]  That's exactly what I'm saying and so I'm frightened because I know what is coming on
[2:16:37.420 --> 2:16:38.420]  the earth.
[2:16:38.420 --> 2:16:43.700]  I know the kind of world which is coming and the people have no idea, generally speaking
[2:16:43.700 --> 2:16:48.340]  the public doesn't know, they don't care because they've been acclimated to it.
[2:16:48.340 --> 2:16:54.980]  They have already learned how to crawl on their knees when they see some holy man with
[2:16:54.980 --> 2:17:02.260]  a robe, if it's a black robe, they shake in fear, if it's a black robe for the priest,
[2:17:02.260 --> 2:17:03.820]  they shake in fear.
[2:17:03.820 --> 2:17:09.580]  So they've been acclimated and taught to be impressed with movie stars and wealthy people
[2:17:09.580 --> 2:17:10.580]  with big money.
[2:17:10.580 --> 2:17:15.860]  But it seems that the elite themselves have gotten more reckless and wild.
[2:17:15.860 --> 2:17:16.860]  Oh, of course.
[2:17:16.860 --> 2:17:22.860]  And the reason why is because they realize the entire human race is worthless.
[2:17:22.860 --> 2:17:28.900]  That the entire human race is going to buy anything you put out there and now it's like
[2:17:28.900 --> 2:17:32.740]  the criminal element doesn't even know what to do with itself anymore.
[2:17:32.740 --> 2:17:33.740]  It's so easy.
[2:17:33.740 --> 2:17:38.020]  It's so easy to just fool the people because they love it.
[2:17:38.020 --> 2:17:43.940]  I mean, exactly, that's like the White House publicly says they're running al-Qaeda and
[2:17:43.940 --> 2:17:48.340]  has them attacking Iran and the media says Iran is al-Qaeda when they're Shiites, the
[2:17:48.340 --> 2:17:49.820]  opposite group.
[2:17:49.820 --> 2:17:57.100]  And then it's just all over the news, Republicans saying we love a terror attacks, they sure
[2:17:57.100 --> 2:18:04.140]  help us and how much more obvious and then Gary Hart writes a letter, has it published
[2:18:04.140 --> 2:18:08.820]  in the newspaper saying our government stages attacks Iran better do what they're told.
[2:18:08.820 --> 2:18:12.540]  I mean, they're basically, they may come out and say they did it soon.
[2:18:12.540 --> 2:18:13.780]  Well, I know.
[2:18:13.780 --> 2:18:14.780]  But you know what?
[2:18:14.780 --> 2:18:19.900]  Nobody's going to care, couldn't care less because it doesn't mean much to anybody anyway.
[2:18:19.900 --> 2:18:26.420]  So it's just, you know, and even on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno when he does the Jay Walks
[2:18:26.420 --> 2:18:31.220]  when he walks off the street and talks to people that ask the average American, you
[2:18:31.220 --> 2:18:33.180]  know, who won the second world war.
[2:18:33.180 --> 2:18:34.500]  They don't even know what you're talking about.
[2:18:34.500 --> 2:18:37.220]  They didn't know there was a second world war.
[2:18:37.220 --> 2:18:42.620]  And you know, and of course, that thing we talked about before about that young lady
[2:18:42.620 --> 2:18:46.540]  Miss Teen America, that was so appalling to me.
[2:18:46.540 --> 2:18:49.540]  I still wake up with a sweaty.
[2:18:49.540 --> 2:18:52.540]  But that's how, listen, that's how people are.
[2:18:52.540 --> 2:18:56.380]  If you know any history, they look at you like you're weird and people kind of sit back
[2:18:56.380 --> 2:18:58.340]  in their chairs and act scared.
[2:18:58.340 --> 2:19:03.660]  I had friends, my personal friends, many years ago.
[2:19:03.660 --> 2:19:07.300]  That's what they used to say about me, that you're weird.
[2:19:07.300 --> 2:19:08.300]  You study it.
[2:19:08.300 --> 2:19:13.460]  And one guy told me, he said, you're the only person I know in our circle of friends that
[2:19:13.460 --> 2:19:14.460]  you don't fit.
[2:19:14.460 --> 2:19:16.860]  I mean, something about you that's just not right.
[2:19:16.860 --> 2:19:18.740]  And I said, in what way?
[2:19:18.740 --> 2:19:23.340]  Well, I mean, you read all those, all that crazy stuff and it's like, what, for instance,
[2:19:23.340 --> 2:19:27.620]  all those law books and all that stuff about religion and all that.
[2:19:27.620 --> 2:19:34.820]  And, you know, the bottom line is that he is so far removed from reality that anybody
[2:19:34.820 --> 2:19:37.860]  has a half a brain, looks like a freak to him.
[2:19:37.860 --> 2:19:39.420]  So I know what it is.
[2:19:39.420 --> 2:19:45.220]  If you are smart, intelligent and inquisitive, you're not going to fit in this world of the
[2:19:45.220 --> 2:19:46.220]  new world.
[2:19:46.220 --> 2:19:47.220]  Stay there, stay there.
[2:19:47.220 --> 2:19:48.220]  Jordan Maxwell, we're going to keep talking.
[2:19:48.220 --> 2:19:53.340]  When I learned that the accumulation of acidic waste was the likely cause of my painful joints,
[2:19:53.340 --> 2:19:57.580]  lack of energy and weight gain, I knew I would have to change to a more alkaline diet.
[2:19:57.580 --> 2:19:59.700]  But it just seems so difficult.
[2:19:59.700 --> 2:20:04.820]  Then a friend suggested I try a Jupiter water ionizer from SnyderHealth.com and detox my
[2:20:04.820 --> 2:20:09.700]  body even before I changed my diet by drinking alkaline ionized water.
[2:20:09.700 --> 2:20:10.700]  Drinking water?
[2:20:10.700 --> 2:20:12.380]  Now that's something I can handle.
[2:20:12.380 --> 2:20:15.620]  The guys at Snyder Health took the time to explain all of the different options and
[2:20:15.620 --> 2:20:17.940]  helped me choose the ionizer that was right for me.
[2:20:17.940 --> 2:20:21.900]  I use my new Jupiter ionizer for everything, for drinking, for cooking.
[2:20:21.900 --> 2:20:26.100]  And since I've been drinking the water, I have more energy, my joint pains are gone,
[2:20:26.100 --> 2:20:30.260]  and I already lost seven pounds, and my skin looks great.
[2:20:30.260 --> 2:20:37.220]  Give them a call today at 877-356-2508 to find out which ionizer is right for you.

[2:20:48.340 --> 2:21:11.300]  On June 4th, 1963, an unknown presidential decree, Executive Order 11,110, was signed
[2:21:11.300 --> 2:21:15.700]  with the authority to strip the Federal Reserve Bank of its power to lend money to the United
[2:21:15.700 --> 2:21:17.340]  States government in interest.
[2:21:17.340 --> 2:21:20.620]  With a stroke of a pen, Kennedy would have put the Fed out of business.
[2:21:20.620 --> 2:21:25.020]  The November assassination quieted the production of the new currency, however the Executive
[2:21:25.020 --> 2:21:27.340]  Order still stands unrepealed.

[2:21:59.260 --> 2:22:01.740]  destroys the official fable forever.

[2:22:10.820 --> 2:22:12.740]  crime are brought to justice.

[2:23:12.980 --> 2:23:18.420]  American Free Press hits the Bilderbergers and Trilateralists, and the whole Council

[2:23:43.500 --> 2:23:47.460]  American Free Press, the voice of the Second American Revolution.
[2:23:47.460 --> 2:23:56.340]  They're going to put in every major U.S. airport a system where you're totally naked, scans
[2:23:56.340 --> 2:23:58.860]  an image and saves it of your naked body.
[2:23:58.860 --> 2:24:03.740]  I told you that six years ago, now it's mainstream news, and they tell you.
[2:24:03.740 --> 2:24:10.020]  Now they take blood without warrants at checkpoints, and Jordan was, during the behind-the-scenes
[2:24:10.020 --> 2:24:13.540]  President Planet TV discussion, he was bringing up the airports.
[2:24:13.540 --> 2:24:15.820]  This is our slave training, isn't it, Jordan?
[2:24:15.820 --> 2:24:17.420]  No doubt about it.
[2:24:17.420 --> 2:24:21.540]  I mean, anybody that's got more than 500 brain cells going all in the same direction knows
[2:24:21.540 --> 2:24:22.540]  it.
[2:24:22.540 --> 2:24:30.620]  It's outrageous, but I was just saying that I went to Disney Studios yesterday, and because
[2:24:30.620 --> 2:24:36.180]  I got a letter from Disney saying that there was a piece of work that I'm doing with Disney,
[2:24:36.180 --> 2:24:40.540]  and they needed a contract signed, and so they said, get this back to us immediately
[2:24:40.540 --> 2:24:45.500]  because you only have a couple of days to get this contract in, so get it immediately
[2:24:45.500 --> 2:24:46.620]  or bring it over.
[2:24:46.620 --> 2:24:51.100]  So I took the contract over in the envelope, sealed it up, and drove over there.
[2:24:51.100 --> 2:24:53.980]  And all the security guard had to do was throw it in the mailbox.
[2:24:53.980 --> 2:24:56.340]  Yeah, just throw it in the mailbox and drop it in the mail.
[2:24:56.340 --> 2:25:00.740]  So I said, this is just a piece of mail, but I wanted to drop it in instead of mailing
[2:25:00.740 --> 2:25:05.820]  it because it's time-sensitive, and he said, oh, no, no, we can't do that, so we have to
[2:25:05.820 --> 2:25:06.820]  open it.
[2:25:06.820 --> 2:25:11.260]  We have to open it up, and I have to read it to see what's in it first before I can deliver
[2:25:11.260 --> 2:25:12.260]  the mail.
[2:25:12.260 --> 2:25:17.300]  I have to at Disney, I have to open the mail, and I have to read the contract, and I've
[2:25:17.300 --> 2:25:22.540]  got to see exactly who wrote this contract, and who signed it, and what it's all about.
[2:25:22.540 --> 2:25:27.820]  See, there's no privacy, no nothing, no, just total control.
[2:25:27.820 --> 2:25:28.820]  Total.
[2:25:28.820 --> 2:25:33.460]  And I said, why don't you just drop it in the mail, because if there's anything wrong,
[2:25:33.460 --> 2:25:38.100]  the people who it's going to will tell me, that's not your business to know, you're just
[2:25:38.100 --> 2:25:39.100]  a security guard.
[2:25:39.100 --> 2:25:45.260]  No, no, I've got the badge, I'm in charge, it's my, I'm the boss because I have the badge,
[2:25:45.260 --> 2:25:49.620]  so I have to open the mail, and I have to sit down and take a few minutes and read this
[2:25:49.620 --> 2:25:55.860]  contract, and see who it's going to, and who signed it, and before I can drop it in the
[2:25:55.860 --> 2:25:56.860]  mail.
[2:25:56.860 --> 2:26:01.180]  I said, why don't you just drop it in the mail, no, no, I have the badge, it's my job,
[2:26:01.180 --> 2:26:02.180]  and I'm in charge.
[2:26:02.180 --> 2:26:09.020]  Well, it's the same kind of thing at the airport, that's why I don't fly anymore.
[2:26:09.020 --> 2:26:12.860]  That's why I do not fly anymore, because I don't have to take my pants off, my shoes
[2:26:12.860 --> 2:26:16.820]  off, and have everything as, why bother?
[2:26:16.820 --> 2:26:21.660]  But now it's going to be on the buses, trains, and the sides of the street, and they know,
[2:26:21.660 --> 2:26:24.660]  they know it's dog training, training us how to be slaves.
[2:26:24.660 --> 2:26:29.020]  Well, that's it, I don't know what else to say, it's all right there in your face.
[2:26:29.020 --> 2:26:33.580]  Well, well, I mean, here's the deal, if the United States is run by the Knights Templars,
[2:26:33.580 --> 2:26:37.860]  or I guess you said it's inseparable, and then the Vatican wants to get rid of the borders,
[2:26:37.860 --> 2:26:41.600]  why does every city, and I have articles that came out in the news today and yesterday, main
[2:26:41.600 --> 2:26:45.340]  line news, the police did not arrest the illegals for drinking and driving, they did not arrest
[2:26:45.340 --> 2:26:53.380]  them for anything but felonies, and they are also hiring aggravated felons, they're mainly
[2:26:53.380 --> 2:26:58.980]  foreigners who joined the military, and the illegals are literally above the law, and
[2:26:58.980 --> 2:27:02.700]  then even when the police say Mexican troops are kidnapping and killing Americans, the
[2:27:02.700 --> 2:27:07.820]  news tells them that can't be true, and I mean, why is Mexico so precious?
[2:27:07.820 --> 2:27:17.340]  Well, because it's a base, first of all, it's a very important base for revolution in the
[2:27:17.340 --> 2:27:23.820]  North America, it's a very important operating base, like the Contras have bases in Central
[2:27:23.820 --> 2:27:30.660]  America, like the Medellin Cartel have their protected bases of operation for drug trafficking,
[2:27:30.660 --> 2:27:39.180]  well, for tyranny and drug trafficking, underworld activities, Mexico is a hotbed, my God, anybody
[2:27:39.180 --> 2:27:46.580]  who's more than 10 years old has been to Mexico knows that, that Mexico is a hotbed for secret
[2:27:46.580 --> 2:27:53.940]  societies, crime, criminal syndicates, drug trafficking, so you want to make sure that
[2:27:53.940 --> 2:28:00.620]  the borders are left open, because the bottom line is that Europe has had enough of American
[2:28:00.620 --> 2:28:01.620]  freedom.
[2:28:01.620 --> 2:28:08.740]  I mean, that's so obvious to me, because I've been looking at it for so many years, it is
[2:28:08.740 --> 2:28:09.740]  obviously-
[2:28:09.740 --> 2:28:13.580]  And we're going to be destroyed by hook or by crook.
[2:28:13.580 --> 2:28:19.580]  Absolutely, because they, you know, that's the only thing Bush ever said that is 100%
[2:28:19.580 --> 2:28:25.900]  correct, he said that our enemies hate us because of our freedom.
[2:28:25.900 --> 2:28:30.980]  The terrorist attacks us because they hate our freedom, and then you find out the terrorist
[2:28:30.980 --> 2:28:34.740]  is the black ops, and they did it to get our freedom, and the government's taking
[2:28:34.740 --> 2:28:35.740]  all our freedom.
[2:28:35.740 --> 2:28:41.020]  Well, but our enemies, the enemy of the American people, hate us because of our freedom, and
[2:28:41.020 --> 2:28:46.500]  I'm going to tell you something that is the bottom line at the end of the day that is
[2:28:46.500 --> 2:28:52.780]  the only truth there is, is that the enemies of this great republic hate this republic
[2:28:52.780 --> 2:28:59.020]  because they cannot have a new world order in which the entire human race crawls on its
[2:28:59.020 --> 2:29:06.900]  knees like animals to their masters of superior masters with a country that talks about individual
[2:29:06.900 --> 2:29:09.940]  freedom, liberty, and justice for all.
[2:29:09.940 --> 2:29:16.420]  You've got to destroy this nation, and the only people, and who are the enemies?
[2:29:16.420 --> 2:29:24.420]  It's the Roman system of Europe that has been dominating the earth for 2,300 years, of which
[2:29:24.420 --> 2:29:27.220]  America rose up against that rule.
[2:29:27.220 --> 2:29:28.220]  Jordan, stay there.
[2:29:28.220 --> 2:29:29.220]  We've got to go to break.
[2:29:29.220 --> 2:29:33.500]  We're going to talk behind scenes, too, but very, very interesting, ladies and gentlemen.
[2:29:33.500 --> 2:29:39.100]  We'll be right back.
[2:29:39.100 --> 2:29:42.820]  We're on the march, the empires on the run.
[2:29:42.820 --> 2:29:48.540]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[2:29:48.540 --> 2:29:50.500]  Our beloved republic is on her knees.
[2:29:50.500 --> 2:29:55.020]  The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide, but in liberty's darkest
[2:29:55.020 --> 2:29:56.540]  hour there is hope.
[2:29:56.540 --> 2:29:59.580]  The first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[2:29:59.580 --> 2:30:03.820]  It is essential that patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding of the new
[2:30:03.820 --> 2:30:05.340]  world order master plan.
[2:30:05.340 --> 2:30:09.580]  We have a short time frame to fully awaken and energize the people to meet this threat.

[2:32:51.380 --> 2:33:07.820]  In the last month there have been more car bombings, more rocket attacks, more killings,
[2:33:07.820 --> 2:33:13.220]  Mexican troops in uniform, came into Phoenix and killed people, I mean the miles over the
[2:33:13.220 --> 2:33:19.420]  border is that, and LAPD won't ask about immigrant status, Associated Press, I was mentioning
[2:33:19.420 --> 2:33:25.580]  that, I've got several articles like this in front of me today, that's out of the Associated
[2:33:25.580 --> 2:33:32.220]  Press, and my whole point is, is that the Spanish stations are all got names like the
[2:33:32.220 --> 2:33:35.740]  rebel, the race, it's all we're going to take over, we're going to get you, we're
[2:33:35.740 --> 2:33:40.140]  going to overthrow the US, and the government's saying, oh my gosh, give all your rights up,
[2:33:40.140 --> 2:33:44.580]  there's al-Qaeda everywhere, and there's no real al-Qaeda, it's al-CIAida, but meanwhile
[2:33:44.580 --> 2:33:52.820]  there is a real group with TV companies buying 700 billboards saying LA belongs to Mexico,
[2:33:52.820 --> 2:33:57.900]  you've got people that are tourist to Mexico, get shut down and robbed, the media covers
[2:33:57.900 --> 2:34:02.300]  that up, you've got the illegal aliens, and I've been told this cop's called in yesterday
[2:34:02.300 --> 2:34:06.140]  and agreed, but I've had it happen right here in Austin, you can drunk drive, no insurance,
[2:34:06.140 --> 2:34:10.540]  no license, above the law, citizens, the books are thrown at, and the police are told do
[2:34:10.540 --> 2:34:15.820]  not arrest illegals, and it says right here, they can be under felony charges, and they
[2:34:15.820 --> 2:34:21.380]  do not bring up if they're illegal or legal or not, that is not an issue, so for all intents
[2:34:21.380 --> 2:34:25.820]  and purposes the borders are wide open, that fence they're putting up is to keep Americans
[2:34:25.820 --> 2:34:33.580]  in, and my whole point is, during the break you were talking about Henry Kissinger's
[2:34:33.580 --> 2:34:37.980]  own book, Kiss the Boys Goodbye, and it's a quote he admits where he said the military
[2:34:37.980 --> 2:34:43.540]  are dumb animals to be used by us, the police are hated by the new world order and used,
[2:34:43.540 --> 2:34:48.460]  the military are hated and used, they call them dumb animals, our future is being destroyed,
[2:34:48.460 --> 2:34:55.180]  and I guess Jordan Maxwell, we the people and the establishment, the minions, I guess
[2:34:55.180 --> 2:34:58.580]  we're just going to assist in our own destruction Jordan.
[2:34:58.580 --> 2:35:04.900]  I guess so, I guess it's just as part of who we are as a people, we have lost our souls,
[2:35:04.900 --> 2:35:10.660]  we have lost our minds, and we've lost our republic, and now we're just going to lose,
[2:35:10.660 --> 2:35:15.900]  period, and the reason why is because most people, I understand, it bothers me, but
[2:35:15.900 --> 2:35:22.060]  I understand why most people do not relate to the stuff that I've been talking about
[2:35:22.060 --> 2:35:27.420]  for 45 years, and I understand why, because most of what I talk about has nothing to do
[2:35:27.420 --> 2:35:35.460]  with football, sports, basketball, none of that, and it has to do with researching and
[2:35:35.460 --> 2:35:40.100]  studying the movements of the bankers, the history of the world, ancient history, and
[2:35:40.100 --> 2:35:41.100]  how it impacted how modern they were.
[2:35:41.100 --> 2:35:43.860]  But why would people not want to know how the world really works?
[2:35:43.860 --> 2:35:44.860]  This is all incredible.
[2:35:44.860 --> 2:35:50.620]  They don't, nobody doesn't have anything to do with basketball, so what is the importance
[2:35:50.620 --> 2:35:51.620]  of it all?
[2:35:51.620 --> 2:35:57.380]  I mean, we don't have anything to do with hooters or football, it might be of importance,
[2:35:57.380 --> 2:36:00.460]  so most people don't give a damn about America, they don't care about freedom.
[2:36:00.460 --> 2:36:03.620]  Well, they better care that their children are being implanted with cancer.
[2:36:03.620 --> 2:36:08.780]  Well, I know, but look at, look at, like the Bible, Jesus saying, look, by their fruits,
[2:36:08.780 --> 2:36:10.420]  you shall know them.
[2:36:10.420 --> 2:36:15.620]  We're supposedly a very Christian nation, we're very holy and righteous nation, by their
[2:36:15.620 --> 2:36:17.380]  fruits, you shall know them.
[2:36:17.380 --> 2:36:20.260]  What is the fruitage of the American civilization today?
[2:36:20.260 --> 2:36:21.260]  We've got crime.
[2:36:21.260 --> 2:36:26.820]  Fifty million abortions, huge buckets of pus, just mental illness, totally degeneracy.
[2:36:26.820 --> 2:36:27.820]  What's that?
[2:36:27.820 --> 2:36:35.060]  Throw in, throw in, drive by shootings, crimes, gang members, rapes, incredible, and law, there
[2:36:35.060 --> 2:36:38.460]  is no law, law is a mockery.
[2:36:38.460 --> 2:36:41.100]  That's by their fruits, you shall know them.
[2:36:41.100 --> 2:36:48.740]  I'm telling you, it's just an incredible story, and then here's a great quote by George Bush's
[2:36:48.740 --> 2:36:50.620]  mother, the president's mother.
[2:36:50.620 --> 2:36:51.620]  Her beautiful mom.
[2:36:51.620 --> 2:36:58.540]  Yeah, Barbara Bush said when she was asked about all the coffins coming back from the
[2:36:58.540 --> 2:37:00.900]  Middle East, all the young men who are dying there.
[2:37:00.900 --> 2:37:02.780]  That was Larry King live, yeah.
[2:37:02.780 --> 2:37:08.620]  Larry King live, she says, quote, this is Barbara Bush saying it about American troops.
[2:37:08.620 --> 2:37:12.860]  She said, why should we hear about body bags and death?
[2:37:12.860 --> 2:37:13.860]  It's not relevant.
[2:37:13.860 --> 2:37:19.140]  So why should I waste my beautiful mind on something like that?
[2:37:19.140 --> 2:37:24.100]  I was just amazed that the president's mother would say, who the hell cares about these
[2:37:24.100 --> 2:37:25.100]  chumps?
[2:37:25.100 --> 2:37:29.700]  And in that same newscast, exactly in that same newscast, she was kind of having a meltdown.
[2:37:29.700 --> 2:37:33.260]  She said, if you talk about it about my family, I will have you killed.
[2:37:33.260 --> 2:37:34.860]  Yeah, I loved it.
[2:37:34.860 --> 2:37:37.820]  So I mean, I mean, she's really telling us who they are.
[2:37:37.820 --> 2:37:41.820]  It's, you know, you're a bunch of scum troops, you're going to service and love us.
[2:37:41.820 --> 2:37:46.220]  I don't want to hear about your dead bodies, shut up maggots scum and help me bring down
[2:37:46.220 --> 2:37:47.220]  this country.
[2:37:47.220 --> 2:37:52.500]  And they even tell us, you are scum, kissing your rights of book and says, I hate you filth.
[2:37:52.500 --> 2:37:54.300]  And they say, yes, yes, I love you.
[2:37:54.300 --> 2:37:55.300]  Call me filth.
[2:37:55.300 --> 2:37:58.740]  I want to attack more countries, inject me full of deadly shots.
[2:37:58.740 --> 2:37:59.740]  Let me breathe.
[2:37:59.740 --> 2:38:00.740]  Do you?
[2:38:00.740 --> 2:38:01.740]  I love dying.
[2:38:01.740 --> 2:38:02.740]  Oh, it's so good.
[2:38:02.740 --> 2:38:03.740]  Yeah.
[2:38:03.740 --> 2:38:07.020]  And, and, and as I said, Henry Kissinger wrote a book called Kiss the Boys Goodbye.
[2:38:07.020 --> 2:38:09.220]  You can buy it in any good bookstore.
[2:38:09.220 --> 2:38:14.420]  And he said quite literally in a quote, he says in his own book, military men are just
[2:38:14.420 --> 2:38:20.500]  dumb, stupid animals to be used as pawns in foreign policy, period.
[2:38:20.500 --> 2:38:21.500]  They're just animals.
[2:38:21.500 --> 2:38:23.980]  So who the hell cares if they get killed?
[2:38:23.980 --> 2:38:24.980]  My God, who cares?
[2:38:24.980 --> 2:38:28.700]  And the sixth thing is you try to tell one of these average guys that they will laugh
[2:38:28.700 --> 2:38:29.700]  right at you.
[2:38:29.700 --> 2:38:30.700]  They won't go read his book.
[2:38:30.700 --> 2:38:31.700]  I didn't write the book.
[2:38:31.700 --> 2:38:33.740]  No, no, I mean, I mean, that's the incredible part.
[2:38:33.740 --> 2:38:37.700]  You go, your master says you're nothing and that they're using you and they'll just smile
[2:38:37.700 --> 2:38:41.420]  at you and say, but I've got some pieces of brass on my chest.
[2:38:41.420 --> 2:38:42.420]  Yeah.
[2:38:42.420 --> 2:38:43.420]  Yeah.
[2:38:43.420 --> 2:38:47.780]  And when I read about that, he said, man, people will step over each other to get killed
[2:38:47.780 --> 2:38:49.940]  if you just give them some pieces of metal.
[2:38:49.940 --> 2:38:51.180]  I know.
[2:38:51.180 --> 2:38:59.180]  And then of course, you know, the lay of fell stone, that's also on page one of my box on
[2:38:59.180 --> 2:39:06.020]  let's see what is it on questions on page one, research on the bottom.
[2:39:06.020 --> 2:39:13.380]  The most holy of all relics in all of England, the most holiest relic in all of England is
[2:39:13.380 --> 2:39:16.180]  something called the lay of fell stone.
[2:39:16.180 --> 2:39:24.820]  It's treasured by the royalty as a very important symbol for royalty power in England, the lay
[2:39:24.820 --> 2:39:25.820]  of fell stone.
[2:39:25.820 --> 2:39:31.940]  Go on my website to questions and scroll down on the front on the first page to the bottom
[2:39:31.940 --> 2:39:34.860]  and you will see the lay of fell stone.
[2:39:34.860 --> 2:39:37.380]  All that is is a phallic symbol.
[2:39:37.380 --> 2:39:38.860]  Have you seen it yourself yet?
[2:39:38.860 --> 2:39:39.860]  Yes.
[2:39:39.860 --> 2:39:40.860]  I've seen it.
[2:39:40.860 --> 2:39:43.140]  I've seen it.
[2:39:43.140 --> 2:39:48.980]  So they put the stuff in your face, phallic symbols, male erections.
[2:39:48.980 --> 2:39:52.860]  We'll put the lay of fell stone up on the screen.
[2:39:52.860 --> 2:39:53.980]  Which subpage is that?
[2:39:53.980 --> 2:40:01.580]  It's on page one of questions on the research box called questions.
[2:40:01.580 --> 2:40:02.580]  Page one at the bottom.
[2:40:02.580 --> 2:40:03.580]  Okay.
[2:40:03.580 --> 2:40:07.180]  So you click research and then you click on the one that says questions.
[2:40:07.180 --> 2:40:12.500]  And then you scroll to the bottom of page one and you will see the most holy, all of
[2:40:12.500 --> 2:40:15.460]  England are the most holy relic in all of England.
[2:40:15.460 --> 2:40:17.220]  It's called the lay of fell stone.
[2:40:17.220 --> 2:40:18.220]  There it is sitting there.
[2:40:18.220 --> 2:40:19.220]  I'm on research.
[2:40:19.220 --> 2:40:22.340]  I see words to search, pictures, quotes.
[2:40:22.340 --> 2:40:24.100]  Go to questions.
[2:40:24.100 --> 2:40:25.580]  The box says questions.
[2:40:25.580 --> 2:40:28.020]  Have you ever wondered?
[2:40:28.020 --> 2:40:29.540]  I think it's called have you ever wondered.
[2:40:29.540 --> 2:40:30.540]  Yeah, there it is.
[2:40:30.540 --> 2:40:31.540]  Have you ever wondered?
[2:40:31.540 --> 2:40:32.540]  Go to page one.
[2:40:32.540 --> 2:40:39.300]  I'll have you ever wondered and scroll down to the bottom of the page number four and
[2:40:39.300 --> 2:40:41.260]  you will see the lay of fell stone.
[2:40:41.260 --> 2:40:45.980]  And beneath it, of course, is a footnote that you can go on the web and study about the
[2:40:45.980 --> 2:40:50.220]  study, the subject of the lay of fell stone for yourself.
[2:40:50.220 --> 2:40:51.220]  Do you see it yet?
[2:40:51.220 --> 2:40:52.540]  Yes, I'm on there.
[2:40:52.540 --> 2:40:53.540]  Yeah.
[2:40:53.540 --> 2:40:58.340]  So that's the most holy relic of British royalty.
[2:40:58.340 --> 2:41:00.740]  And so I don't know what that tells you.
[2:41:00.740 --> 2:41:03.100]  Tell folks what the dog tags mean.
[2:41:03.100 --> 2:41:04.100]  Yeah.
[2:41:04.100 --> 2:41:10.980]  The dog tag is that's what military people and people in law enforcement have an identification
[2:41:10.980 --> 2:41:15.140]  thing on a chain around the neck and it's called a dog tag.
[2:41:15.140 --> 2:41:20.140]  And the reason why is because that's exactly what the military is conceived to be, a bunch
[2:41:20.140 --> 2:41:21.140]  of dogs.
[2:41:21.140 --> 2:41:25.180]  I mean, that's what Henry Kissinger said.
[2:41:25.180 --> 2:41:26.180]  I don't know.
[2:41:26.180 --> 2:41:27.980]  It's just an outright just to me.
[2:41:27.980 --> 2:41:29.940]  All you got to do is just read a book.
[2:41:29.940 --> 2:41:33.380]  Just go to the library and get a book on any of these subjects.
[2:41:33.380 --> 2:41:35.180]  And like I said, just go on my website.
[2:41:35.180 --> 2:41:37.140]  I've already done all the research for you.
[2:41:37.140 --> 2:41:42.860]  Just go on my website and go to research boxes and there's all kinds of boxes there on all
[2:41:42.860 --> 2:41:50.140]  kinds of subjects and go through my website because there's a lot of material on the links.
[2:41:50.140 --> 2:41:54.900]  And I don't even, there's just so much on my website.
[2:41:54.900 --> 2:41:55.900]  It's very difficult.
[2:41:55.900 --> 2:41:59.900]  Let's go through words of this research and just spend a minute or so on each one.
[2:41:59.900 --> 2:42:00.900]  The black hand.
[2:42:00.900 --> 2:42:02.100]  Tell folks about the black hand.
[2:42:02.100 --> 2:42:06.580]  Well, that was a precursor to what we today call mafia.
[2:42:06.580 --> 2:42:12.300]  Of course, Anastasia, but a long time ago in the Middle Ages, what we call today mafia,
[2:42:12.300 --> 2:42:15.820]  La Cousinastra was called black hand.
[2:42:15.820 --> 2:42:18.540]  Black of course, being the planet, the Saffron.
[2:42:18.540 --> 2:42:21.300]  So it was a Saturnian secret society.
[2:42:21.300 --> 2:42:25.260]  The black hand later become known as La Cousinastra.
[2:42:25.260 --> 2:42:29.420]  It was connected to the Masonic orders.
[2:42:29.420 --> 2:42:31.860]  And of course, Hoover said it didn't exist.
[2:42:31.860 --> 2:42:33.780]  Kind of like the North American Union.
[2:42:33.780 --> 2:42:34.780]  Does it exist?
[2:42:34.780 --> 2:42:37.380]  I mean, this incredible denial.
[2:42:37.380 --> 2:42:42.460]  How do you deal with the denial when all of this is going on around people and they just
[2:42:42.460 --> 2:42:43.460]  say it doesn't exist?
[2:42:43.460 --> 2:42:44.460]  I know.
[2:42:44.460 --> 2:42:45.460]  And so what can you do?
[2:42:45.460 --> 2:42:46.460]  I mean, what can you say?
[2:42:46.460 --> 2:42:51.980]  All I know is I just put it out there and people, like I said, ask me questions that
[2:42:51.980 --> 2:42:53.620]  are right here on my website.
[2:42:53.620 --> 2:42:54.620]  No, I know.
[2:42:54.620 --> 2:42:55.620]  But we're doing this live on the radio.
[2:42:55.620 --> 2:42:59.740]  British East India Company, I know all about them, but tell folks why that's so important.
[2:42:59.740 --> 2:43:02.580]  This is the modern model of the corporate fascism.
[2:43:02.580 --> 2:43:03.580]  That's right.
[2:43:03.580 --> 2:43:09.500]  And that's where the United States as a corporation, as a world, a difference between the United
[2:43:09.500 --> 2:43:13.100]  States of America up until 1868.
[2:43:13.100 --> 2:43:17.500]  And after 1868, we have a new operation called United States.
[2:43:17.500 --> 2:43:19.700]  It's not a republic anymore.
[2:43:19.700 --> 2:43:21.620]  It's called a public policy.
[2:43:21.620 --> 2:43:26.620]  You know, even the Supreme Court, the head of the Supreme Court, I've got a quote on
[2:43:26.620 --> 2:43:30.780]  my website, or I'm going to put it out if I don't have it, where the head of the Supreme
[2:43:30.780 --> 2:43:39.700]  Court said that the Constitution of the United States was officially done away with in 1868
[2:43:39.700 --> 2:43:44.340]  officially by law in 1868, period.
[2:43:44.340 --> 2:43:45.660]  It has not been enforced.
[2:43:45.660 --> 2:43:52.180]  It has not been of any value in this country or in this operation of this republic at all,
[2:43:52.180 --> 2:43:53.180]  period.
[2:43:53.180 --> 2:43:57.740]  But now that they still kept some of the old conventions, now they're fully doing away
[2:43:57.740 --> 2:44:01.340]  with it, even in practice, a chattel property.
[2:44:01.340 --> 2:44:04.460]  Yeah, chattel property at you.
[2:44:04.460 --> 2:44:05.460]  It's movable.
[2:44:05.460 --> 2:44:06.860]  It's movable dirt.
[2:44:06.860 --> 2:44:07.860]  It's property.
[2:44:07.860 --> 2:44:09.340]  It's like a real estate.
[2:44:09.340 --> 2:44:12.700]  And part of the real estate is you, because you live on the real estate.
[2:44:12.700 --> 2:44:19.580]  So they refer to humans as chattel property or movable dirt.
[2:44:19.580 --> 2:44:20.580]  Cognitive dissidents.
[2:44:20.580 --> 2:44:25.940]  Yeah, cognitive dissidents is what the whole country, this whole entire republic is filled
[2:44:25.940 --> 2:44:33.020]  with cognitive dissidents, meaning if you hear something that you've never heard before
[2:44:33.020 --> 2:44:38.900]  or is in opposition to something you've always believed, your mind cannot be wrapped around
[2:44:38.900 --> 2:44:41.140]  that information.
[2:44:41.140 --> 2:44:42.700]  You just don't want to hear it.
[2:44:42.700 --> 2:44:46.540]  You don't want to hear it because it doesn't have anything to do with what you believe
[2:44:46.540 --> 2:44:50.060]  and you have your own truth and so you don't want to look at the facts.
[2:44:50.060 --> 2:44:52.180]  You can't even deal with it.
[2:44:52.180 --> 2:44:56.100]  So the fact that we told everybody there was mercury in there and the government said there's
[2:44:56.100 --> 2:45:00.460]  no mercury in the shots and now that they've had to admit, okay, brand damage tens of millions
[2:45:00.460 --> 2:45:01.460]  and it is in there.
[2:45:01.460 --> 2:45:02.460]  Yeah, I know.
[2:45:02.460 --> 2:45:09.100]  It's, you know, and like I said, the slaves, the slaves, the slaves were told that it was
[2:45:09.100 --> 2:45:10.100]  not in there.
[2:45:10.100 --> 2:45:13.700]  So they will default to the old line and say, I don't care if the government admits it
[2:45:13.700 --> 2:45:14.700]  now.
[2:45:14.700 --> 2:45:15.700]  I love it.
[2:45:15.700 --> 2:45:21.940]  Yeah, I know another word, another word in the box of words to research Congress.
[2:45:21.940 --> 2:45:25.300]  You talk about the Congress, you have, you know, I, the people have no idea in the world
[2:45:25.300 --> 2:45:27.340]  what the word Congress really means.
[2:45:27.340 --> 2:45:28.340]  Tell them what it means.
[2:45:28.340 --> 2:45:29.340]  Yeah.
[2:45:29.340 --> 2:45:36.740]  If you go to any good dictionary, Congress, sex, sex, you have two words to caress and
[2:45:36.740 --> 2:45:37.740]  then Congress.
[2:45:37.740 --> 2:45:42.260]  And you have the upper and lower house with the goddess and the male phallus coming together.
[2:45:42.260 --> 2:45:43.260]  That's right.
[2:45:43.260 --> 2:45:47.900]  The Washington Monument is a male erection and it, and it connects directly to the
[2:45:47.900 --> 2:45:52.340]  oval or the ovaries or the oval office.
[2:45:52.340 --> 2:45:56.700]  And that's why you have the Congress because you've got the male phallic Washington Monument
[2:45:56.700 --> 2:45:59.860]  connecting to the oval or ovaries or oval office.
[2:45:59.860 --> 2:46:03.300]  Basically, we have a sun guy slash sex cult running things.
[2:46:03.300 --> 2:46:04.980]  Well, that's the bottom line.
[2:46:04.980 --> 2:46:05.980]  And they love killing people.
[2:46:05.980 --> 2:46:06.980]  I know.
[2:46:06.980 --> 2:46:10.780]  I know about the enjoyment of slaughtering.
[2:46:10.780 --> 2:46:14.340]  Like you or I would feel bad murdering masses of people, especially children.
[2:46:14.340 --> 2:46:18.020]  They, they are very pious and say it's a very beautiful loving thing.
[2:46:18.020 --> 2:46:21.980]  Well, I mean, that one general said it was, you know, on my website, I got that quote
[2:46:21.980 --> 2:46:26.980]  in the box of quotes as a picture of the general and testify where he said that one
[2:46:26.980 --> 2:46:31.740]  of the top generals in the Middle East said for American generals said, yeah, it's sometimes
[2:46:31.740 --> 2:46:33.540]  fun to kill people.
[2:46:33.540 --> 2:46:34.540]  We kind of like it.
[2:46:34.540 --> 2:46:35.540]  Kind of fun shooting people.
[2:46:35.540 --> 2:46:38.060]  It was kind of like a game.
[2:46:38.060 --> 2:46:40.540]  See how many you can take down before lunch.
[2:46:40.540 --> 2:46:43.900]  You know, it's kind of fun to kill people, but then if you were going after his family,
[2:46:43.900 --> 2:46:44.900]  you take it real serious.
[2:46:44.900 --> 2:46:48.740]  Oh, no, that's different because now you are a terrorist.
[2:46:48.740 --> 2:46:52.140]  I mean, I, I, you know, I just don't know what to think about the whole world.
[2:46:52.140 --> 2:46:53.140]  I live in anymore.
[2:46:53.140 --> 2:46:54.980]  Hey, what was the crazy?
[2:46:54.980 --> 2:46:55.980]  What was the inquisition?
[2:46:55.980 --> 2:46:57.620]  I mean, there was so many inquisitions.
[2:46:57.620 --> 2:46:58.620]  Yeah.
[2:46:58.620 --> 2:47:04.820]  There's so many, but basically the Pope today, uh, Ratzinger was the head, uh, before he
[2:47:04.820 --> 2:47:11.700]  became Pope was the head of that organization in the Vatican that was, we call the inquisition.
[2:47:11.700 --> 2:47:15.620]  Yeah, that up keeps quote, the doctrine that keeps the continuity of the church together.
[2:47:15.620 --> 2:47:16.620]  Yes.
[2:47:16.620 --> 2:47:21.420]  And what it was doing the middle ages, we call it the dark ages because the human race
[2:47:21.420 --> 2:47:23.980]  were going through things which were very dark.
[2:47:23.980 --> 2:47:30.300]  And that's why we call it that time as the dark ages because we were in the really going
[2:47:30.300 --> 2:47:33.540]  through some, why were they trying to suppress all scientific knowledge?
[2:47:33.540 --> 2:47:36.020]  We knew they'd hoarded it all and knew the truth.
[2:47:36.020 --> 2:47:37.020]  Why did they want it?
[2:47:37.020 --> 2:47:41.660]  And now they want to, uh, the club of Rome, the Bilderberg, they say again, they want
[2:47:41.660 --> 2:47:47.140]  10% of us to be living, basically living on farms, everybody else exterminated, and
[2:47:47.140 --> 2:47:51.180]  then they'll be in high tech citadels, uh, bases separately from us.
[2:47:51.180 --> 2:47:53.500]  Well, I know, but that's, that's exactly right.
[2:47:53.500 --> 2:47:59.820]  But the inquisition was an extraordinarily important time in human history in Europe
[2:47:59.820 --> 2:48:06.380]  when anyone who would even act like you're going to, uh, that you are for liberty and
[2:48:06.380 --> 2:48:11.580]  justice and freedom, freedom of thought, freedom of religion, freedom to think you
[2:48:11.580 --> 2:48:17.900]  were hunted down by the Vatican, brought in, and we, we know the stuff that went on.
[2:48:17.900 --> 2:48:23.180]  The Vatican priests would pour hot lead into children's faces in front of the parents.
[2:48:23.180 --> 2:48:26.500]  They would open your mouth or the children's mouth and pour hot lead.
[2:48:26.500 --> 2:48:31.780]  Now we see that being repeated now psychologically, they know when they do the wild house memos
[2:48:31.780 --> 2:48:37.620]  ordering the FBI, the, the joint chiefs of staff to tell them to torture children with
[2:48:37.620 --> 2:48:42.820]  pliers, rip their genitals off, uh, and then the public hears that and accepts it and says,
[2:48:42.820 --> 2:48:44.420]  oh yeah, that's Jack Bauer.
[2:48:44.420 --> 2:48:46.460]  That's a great journey of evil, isn't it?
[2:48:46.460 --> 2:48:50.580]  If they can get us to accept the most evil thing, torturing children sexually, then
[2:48:50.580 --> 2:48:52.020]  they've got us, don't they Jordan?
[2:48:52.020 --> 2:48:54.460]  Oh, they've got the whole human race.
[2:48:54.460 --> 2:48:56.300]  They've got the entire human race.
[2:48:56.300 --> 2:48:57.700]  Go to any good law bucket.
[2:48:57.700 --> 2:49:02.140]  Here's, here's one on my, uh, law and the words to research.
[2:49:02.140 --> 2:49:04.260]  Look up the word human being.
[2:49:04.260 --> 2:49:10.420]  A human being, according to this particular law book says, uh, human being is a animal,
[2:49:10.420 --> 2:49:12.220]  a monster.
[2:49:12.220 --> 2:49:17.420]  Then you look up the word monster and it will tell you a monster is, uh, is a human being
[2:49:17.420 --> 2:49:19.380]  and has no rights to anything.
[2:49:19.380 --> 2:49:20.380]  It's just an animal.
[2:49:20.380 --> 2:49:22.940]  So it's all a big joke to them that they've changed all the terms.
[2:49:22.940 --> 2:49:24.460]  You don't know what it means.
[2:49:24.460 --> 2:49:26.380]  Office of controlled conflict operations.
[2:49:26.380 --> 2:49:27.380]  Yeah.
[2:49:27.380 --> 2:49:33.140]  And, and when you read mine comp, uh, Adolf Hitler's book, mine comp, we, we've known
[2:49:33.140 --> 2:49:38.900]  for, I mean, I grew up as a kid knowing, uh, I had, uh, New York times, my, my dad showed
[2:49:38.900 --> 2:49:45.020]  it to me many years ago in the New York times had a huge article about mine comp was written
[2:49:45.020 --> 2:49:47.180]  by a Jesuit priest.

[2:49:54.780 --> 2:50:00.260]  up father's step all and it will tell you all of the information there about who actually
[2:50:00.260 --> 2:50:08.340]  wrote mine comp, it was a Jesuit priest at the Vatican wrote mine comp for Adolf Hitler.
[2:50:08.340 --> 2:50:14.380]  And so, uh, you know, I just, uh, I'm amazed at how much people don't read.
[2:50:14.380 --> 2:50:16.260]  That's what my website is all about.
[2:50:16.260 --> 2:50:22.980]  Just go on my website and run the through all of the boxes, all of the, uh, links, all
[2:50:22.980 --> 2:50:27.060]  of the, uh, esoteric research boxes, a lot of stuff there.
[2:50:27.060 --> 2:50:28.060]  Okay.
[2:50:28.060 --> 2:50:29.060]  Jordan, we were going to take calls.
[2:50:29.060 --> 2:50:33.460]  We're not going to, cause I want to just spend every minute covering issues with you here.
[2:50:33.460 --> 2:50:34.900]  People want Jordan Maxwell on the show.

[2:50:48.740 --> 2:50:52.900]  Hello, I'm Dr. Leonard Horowitz, author of 15 books on health and natural healing vaccines
[2:50:52.900 --> 2:50:56.620]  included medicines kill more people every year than any illness.
[2:50:56.620 --> 2:51:01.460]  The cost of drug side effects in America is more than $200 billion annually with a worst
[2:51:01.460 --> 2:51:03.460]  toll taken by antibiotics.
[2:51:03.460 --> 2:51:07.820]  But there is a cure for this medical madness that has remained secret oxy silver developed
[2:51:07.820 --> 2:51:13.100]  by NASA scientists to keep astronauts healthy is an evolutionary new dietary supplement making
[2:51:13.100 --> 2:51:18.500]  deadly vaccinations and antibiotics obsolete, taking one to two teaspoons daily boosts natural
[2:51:18.500 --> 2:51:20.900]  immunity without drug toxicity.
[2:51:20.900 --> 2:51:23.900]  Oxy silver combines oxygen and silver in a new way.
[2:51:23.900 --> 2:51:28.860]  The oxygen becomes a supercharged germ killer freeing your immune system to fight colds,
[2:51:28.860 --> 2:51:30.500]  flus, cancers and more.
[2:51:30.500 --> 2:51:35.900]  Build disease defenses naturally, painlessly, powerfully, safely and inexpensively with oxy

[2:51:47.900 --> 2:51:54.780]  It is a big idea, a new world order in the near future.
[2:51:54.780 --> 2:52:01.420]  Earth is dominated by a powerful world government is known as the builder bird, but their objective
[2:52:01.420 --> 2:52:04.740]  being world domination for thousands of years.
[2:52:04.740 --> 2:52:09.500]  Their dark order grew now as they hail the birth of the new world order.
[2:52:09.500 --> 2:52:17.740]  Their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand for the first time in
[2:52:17.740 --> 2:52:18.740]  history.
[2:52:18.740 --> 2:52:21.940]  The elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[2:52:21.940 --> 2:52:26.260]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire new world order agenda.
[2:52:26.260 --> 2:52:28.900]  Build a bird is making great progress for the world government.
[2:52:28.900 --> 2:52:32.020]  Most people have no idea they're not after money, they have all the money they need.
[2:52:32.020 --> 2:52:34.220]  They're after power, yes they're after easier.

[2:52:45.660 --> 2:52:47.660]  You have been warned.
[2:52:47.660 --> 2:52:51.860]  Did you know that pH balance is one of the most important factors in maintaining high
[2:52:51.860 --> 2:52:53.820]  energy and vibrant health?
[2:52:53.820 --> 2:52:59.020]  Most experts agree that the water you drink should be at a pH level of 9 or higher.
[2:52:59.020 --> 2:53:03.940]  Plasma pH drops combine a unique formula of the most alkaline minerals and elements.
[2:53:03.940 --> 2:53:07.940]  This product is a one of a kind in its strength and effectiveness.
[2:53:07.940 --> 2:53:12.900]  Using plasma pH drops is one of the best ways to make your water alkaline while helping
[2:53:12.900 --> 2:53:16.380]  you get rid of acid and regaining your health and energy.
[2:53:16.380 --> 2:53:22.580]  With just 10 drops, you can raise the pH level of the water you drink up to the pH of 10.
[2:53:22.580 --> 2:53:27.220]  Alkalizing water helps the body rid itself of acidic waste and increases the oxygen content
[2:53:27.220 --> 2:53:28.380]  of your body.
[2:53:28.380 --> 2:53:33.460]  Disease organisms like bacteria and cancer cannot survive in an alkaline environment.

[2:54:28.460 --> 2:54:34.340]  Bill Joy, son of Microsystems wrote and said he went to a meeting with 200 plus elitist
[2:54:34.340 --> 2:54:38.540]  and he was shocked to hear them talking about how we're all going to have to be killed.
[2:54:38.540 --> 2:54:42.540]  When the police officers out there, most of them will aid the system incrementally as
[2:54:42.540 --> 2:54:46.300]  the rest of us are euthanized, sterilized, given cancer, die.
[2:54:46.300 --> 2:54:49.420]  They will watch as their sons, daughters, mothers, brothers die.
[2:54:49.420 --> 2:54:53.020]  They themselves will die thanking their Lord, thanking their government, thanking their
[2:54:53.020 --> 2:54:54.020]  master.
[2:54:54.020 --> 2:54:56.060]  That is the New World Order Slave Grid.
[2:54:56.060 --> 2:55:00.980]  At the highest levels of the New World Order, Jordan, you know, I've heard it described
[2:55:00.980 --> 2:55:06.060]  as the great white brotherhood, you know, the council of 13, and we know there's less
[2:55:06.060 --> 2:55:11.020]  than 100 really true initiates that have the full picture of their master plan.
[2:55:11.020 --> 2:55:16.180]  But as best you can tell, hey, who are a few of the top initiates to the most secret elite
[2:55:16.180 --> 2:55:17.180]  group?
[2:55:17.180 --> 2:55:18.740]  What's the name of that group?
[2:55:18.740 --> 2:55:22.100]  And will they be able to carry out their plans?
[2:55:22.100 --> 2:55:28.700]  Well, look, the only way I can answer that is that first of all, I'm not privy to be
[2:55:28.700 --> 2:55:33.980]  on the inside to know the top people are, but I've had enough experience when I got
[2:55:33.980 --> 2:55:43.980]  married, you know, the person my wife was working for, I learned a lot because I found
[2:55:43.980 --> 2:55:49.980]  out that so many of the people who are the real movers and shakers who are making things
[2:55:49.980 --> 2:55:53.540]  happen, you will never know their names ever.
[2:55:53.540 --> 2:55:56.260]  You will never hear their names ever.
[2:55:56.260 --> 2:56:00.380]  And that all the people that you are hearing, like the Rockefellers and the Rothschilds
[2:56:00.380 --> 2:56:04.180]  and all those people are not the real players.
[2:56:04.180 --> 2:56:09.780]  The real players are so much more powerful and so much more hidden.
[2:56:09.780 --> 2:56:12.220]  You will never know who they really are.
[2:56:12.220 --> 2:56:17.980]  They are, they cannot afford to have their name or their face ever put out in public.
[2:56:17.980 --> 2:56:20.020]  So I learned that a long time ago.
[2:56:20.020 --> 2:56:24.620]  Well, you know, as far as dynasties go, I mean, you know, you've got the, the sax cover
[2:56:24.620 --> 2:56:31.100]  go to the British, you've got the Rockefellers and Rothschilds certainly set on large piles
[2:56:31.100 --> 2:56:32.100]  of the wealth.
[2:56:32.100 --> 2:56:33.100]  Of course, of course they did.
[2:56:33.100 --> 2:56:37.300]  But I mean, you're saying the true, you know, the true technocrats, though, that are really
[2:56:37.300 --> 2:56:38.540]  running the ship.
[2:56:38.540 --> 2:56:39.540]  Yeah.
[2:56:39.540 --> 2:56:41.900]  Our people, you will never know who they are.
[2:56:41.900 --> 2:56:43.380]  You will never see their names.
[2:56:43.380 --> 2:56:46.380]  You will never hear their names spoken ever.
[2:56:46.380 --> 2:56:50.700]  And those are the people who are really running the planet behind the scenes.
[2:56:50.700 --> 2:56:55.980]  And like a classic example is the Vatican, but the Vatican isn't the bottom line on,
[2:56:55.980 --> 2:56:57.660]  on, on this subject.
[2:56:57.660 --> 2:57:00.100]  There are powers behind the Vatican.
[2:57:00.100 --> 2:57:03.820]  There are, there's just as there was behind the Caesars of Rome.
[2:57:03.820 --> 2:57:06.980]  Caesars of Rome saw themselves as gods.
[2:57:06.980 --> 2:57:11.260]  But in point of fact, they had masters of their own.
[2:57:11.260 --> 2:57:16.740]  And well, you've always got the inner councils and the orders and then the bankers for it.
[2:57:16.740 --> 2:57:18.740]  What's the real power behind the Vatican throne?
[2:57:18.740 --> 2:57:25.420]  Well, there was the, during the time of the Roman Empire behind the Caesars, the raw child
[2:57:25.420 --> 2:57:34.500]  of the Rockefeller types behind the Caesars of Rome was called the Peacehouse family, P-I-C-O-E-P-I-C-O-S
[2:57:34.500 --> 2:57:35.500]  Peacehouse family.
[2:57:35.500 --> 2:57:37.100]  So the, so the Black nobility of today.
[2:57:37.100 --> 2:57:38.100]  Yeah.
[2:57:38.100 --> 2:57:40.820]  The Black nobility or the Peacehouse family.
[2:57:40.820 --> 2:57:45.140]  And the Peacehouse was, the father was Arius Copernicus Peacehouse.
[2:57:45.140 --> 2:57:53.180]  They were the real manipulators of the Roman Empire, along with their family and dynasties.
[2:57:53.180 --> 2:57:57.900]  They were the wise men, the power behind the throne, pouring over the parchment in their
[2:57:57.900 --> 2:57:58.900]  citadels.
[2:57:58.900 --> 2:57:59.900]  That's it.
[2:57:59.900 --> 2:58:00.900]  That's exactly right.
[2:58:00.900 --> 2:58:04.700]  And, and today, that still is today an operation.
[2:58:04.700 --> 2:58:09.620]  Powerful people behind world governments are setting, reading their, their, their, their
[2:58:09.620 --> 2:58:12.660]  Here's an example on, on a, I mean, so above, so below.
[2:58:12.660 --> 2:58:13.660]  Yep.
[2:58:13.660 --> 2:58:14.980]  I mean, here's another quick example.
[2:58:14.980 --> 2:58:18.700]  The final segment when Jordan Maxwell coming up here after a one minute break, there's
[2:58:18.700 --> 2:58:23.220]  a bank that owns a whole bunch of oil wells and gas wells all over Texas.
[2:58:23.220 --> 2:58:24.220]  And you never know.
[2:58:24.220 --> 2:58:30.060]  It's a tiny little bank and a little guy living in a trailer with a ride back.

[2:59:57.020 --> 2:59:58.820]  at his website.
[2:59:58.820 --> 3:00:04.620]  Really appreciate him spending the last two hours with us.
[3:00:04.620 --> 3:00:08.540]  He's just talking to some family that was doing some business in East Texas, they were
[3:00:08.540 --> 3:00:12.940]  telling me about this bank locally that owns so much the land, so much the property, so
[3:00:12.940 --> 3:00:19.140]  many of the houses, and you find out the guy that owns this 100 year old bank is in a little
[3:00:19.140 --> 3:00:23.380]  bitty house with a trailer behind it, and you never know, you know, the guy's got like
[3:00:23.380 --> 3:00:28.420]  two teeth in his head, there's lots of that, and so that's at the local level, somebody
[3:00:28.420 --> 3:00:33.100]  worth, you know, half a billion dollars conservatively, you never even know they had any money, they're
[3:00:33.100 --> 3:00:36.980]  not any listings of wealthy people, and it's the same thing, you hear Bill Gates is the
[3:00:36.980 --> 3:00:40.860]  richest with 80 billion bucks, that's a joke folks, you notice he gave most of his money
[3:00:40.860 --> 3:00:46.380]  for eugenics, so the Warren Buffett, then it turns out IBM set up Microsoft as a front
[3:00:46.380 --> 3:00:51.620]  company to get past trust busting, and you find out that it's set up for eugenics as
[3:00:51.620 --> 3:00:56.460]  a family trust, the father of core, I mean that's their religion, isn't it, is killing
[3:00:56.460 --> 3:01:02.340]  us and hurting us, it's a predator's religion, they revel in hurting us, JordanMaxwell.
[3:01:02.340 --> 3:01:07.380]  That's right, you know, and to mutate the human race into a race of animals, oh my god, we've
[3:01:07.380 --> 3:01:12.900]  watched that on television and movies, there have been tons of television shows and movies
[3:01:12.900 --> 3:01:20.780]  and books written about, you know, the new order and, you know, Island of Lost Souls,
[3:01:20.780 --> 3:01:26.580]  back in 1939, Charles Lawton made a movie called Island of Lost Souls, 1965.
[3:01:26.580 --> 3:01:30.700]  Yeah, that's off the island of Dr. Maru with the Eugenicist's HD Wells.
[3:01:30.700 --> 3:01:35.660]  That's right, and then that's precisely the point, and so we've been told about this stuff
[3:01:35.660 --> 3:01:39.380]  for years and movies and TV about the world that's coming.
[3:01:39.380 --> 3:01:42.860]  Well, it's about ultimate domination, the greatest control freak doesn't just want
[3:01:42.860 --> 3:01:47.180]  your money in control, they want to hurt you, they want to kill you, they want to turn you
[3:01:47.180 --> 3:01:52.100]  into a monkey creature and laugh at you because they want to be gods, I was in a hotel in
[3:01:52.100 --> 3:01:57.020]  London and these people that, you know, were looking at us disdainfully, oh you're Alex
[3:01:57.020 --> 3:02:01.900]  Jones and they're like, we're Royal and we vacation all year and you're scum, and whether
[3:02:01.900 --> 3:02:06.260]  they were or not, the point is they wanted me to know that they're miserable, unhappy
[3:02:06.260 --> 3:02:07.260]  cancers.
[3:02:07.260 --> 3:02:13.300]  Well, you're right, no doubt about it, and if anybody, and I need to say this again,
[3:02:13.300 --> 3:02:18.300]  if anybody's really interested in the subject of a cult and secret societies, there's a
[3:02:18.300 --> 3:02:24.260]  reference book on my home pages that's filled with that about, I don't know, 560 pages
[3:02:24.260 --> 3:02:30.540]  of the very thick book on all of the secret societies, the cult orders of Europe around
[3:02:30.540 --> 3:02:38.100]  the world, religious orders, the different cults of theology, secret societies, criminal
[3:02:38.100 --> 3:02:45.740]  societies, it's just generally an incredibly well-written book called Occult Theocracy,
[3:02:45.740 --> 3:02:52.380]  the world of the occult secret societies, and the most impressive book I ever have
[3:02:52.380 --> 3:03:00.300]  read on theology and religion was called Symbol Sex and the Stars, and it is a very
[3:03:00.300 --> 3:03:08.340]  well-written book just explaining theology, and then again that term, the stars, the movie
[3:03:08.340 --> 3:03:09.340]  stars.
[3:03:09.340 --> 3:03:14.020]  Of course, and it doesn't matter, absolutely, and that's where we get it from, and of course
[3:03:14.020 --> 3:03:21.500]  the other book I have on my home page is Stellar Theology and Masonic Astronomy, incredibly
[3:03:21.500 --> 3:03:30.180]  important explaining how the astrological symbols and terms that are used in secret
[3:03:30.180 --> 3:03:39.300]  societies have to have a book called Stellar Theology and Masonic Astronomy, it's right
[3:03:39.300 --> 3:03:45.140]  there on my home page, and of course there's a downloadable box just beneath it, and there's
[3:03:45.140 --> 3:03:50.540]  all kinds of documents and materials that you can't find anywhere that I've made available
[3:03:50.540 --> 3:03:51.540]  to people.
[3:03:51.540 --> 3:03:56.620]  Well, Jordan, I just want to say in closing, thank you so much for spending time with us
[3:03:56.620 --> 3:04:00.660]  again, and coming up not this Sunday, but the Sunday after next, we've got you on the
[3:04:00.660 --> 3:04:04.620]  Sunday show, and I'm glad you've been spending so much time with us, and we'll go through
[3:04:04.620 --> 3:04:08.500]  some more of these terms and hopefully get people to just to think about looking behind
[3:04:08.500 --> 3:04:12.460]  the curtain and realize there is a curtain, and we can argue about what's behind it all
[3:04:12.460 --> 3:04:16.380]  day, but the important thing is to get people thinking and to move forward, and I really
[3:04:16.380 --> 3:04:19.420]  appreciate you spending time with us, Jordan Maxwell.
[3:04:19.420 --> 3:04:23.380]  Well, I thank you for being my friend and letting me on, thank you very much for everything.
[3:04:23.380 --> 3:04:24.900]  You bet, thank you, Jordan Maxwell.
[3:04:24.900 --> 3:04:28.580]  Yeah, listeners, a few months ago, were like, is Jordan Maxwell on well?
[3:04:28.580 --> 3:04:31.300]  He agreed to come on, he said he wouldn't do interviews anymore, and we twisted his
[3:04:31.300 --> 3:04:37.580]  arm into it two in one week, so there is Jordan Maxwell for you and back in about a week and
[3:04:37.580 --> 3:04:41.220]  a half again for everybody.

[3:07:45.100 --> 3:07:51.020]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network probably presents the Alex Jones show because there's
[3:07:51.020 --> 3:07:53.780]  a war on for your mind.
[3:07:53.780 --> 3:08:01.980]  Okay, we have State Representative Charles Key on with us for the next 55 minutes.
[3:08:01.980 --> 3:08:09.500]  He valiantly has exposed the fact that there's a cover up of what really happened to the
[3:08:09.500 --> 3:08:14.980]  Oklahoma City bombing since he first really pushed with grand jurors and others to expose
[3:08:14.980 --> 3:08:15.980]  that.
[3:08:15.980 --> 3:08:20.260]  It's come out that the Southern Poverty Law Center was involved in running the white
[3:08:20.260 --> 3:08:24.780]  supremacist compound at Elohim City.
[3:08:24.780 --> 3:08:29.100]  They got to get our guns one way or the other, don't they, these America haters.
[3:08:29.100 --> 3:08:33.260]  And it's also come out, it's sworn half of David's in major newspapers that McVeigh was
[3:08:33.260 --> 3:08:34.780]  a government operative.
[3:08:34.780 --> 3:08:40.700]  We already knew that and the fact that the building was blown out, not in and it's just
[3:08:40.700 --> 3:08:42.700]  amazing we covered that in my film Road to Tyranny.
[3:08:42.700 --> 3:08:46.580]  And I want to spend some time at the end of the interview dealing with the new developments
[3:08:46.580 --> 3:08:57.500]  there with the Representative Key, but about a week ago we learned the good news.
[3:08:57.500 --> 3:09:04.180]  And that dovetails with other states like Arizona, one of the Dakotas, New Hampshire
[3:09:04.180 --> 3:09:08.620]  saying that if a new World War continues or gun confiscation begins or any of this happens,
[3:09:08.620 --> 3:09:10.060]  we're going to pull out, we're going to secede.
[3:09:10.060 --> 3:09:14.460]  Well, this story was from World Ant Daily was also in some of the Oklahoma papers, Oklahoma
[3:09:14.460 --> 3:09:20.540]  to Feds, Don't Tread on Me, State House Defends its Sovereignty from DC, Intrusion, and this
[3:09:20.540 --> 3:09:23.060]  is what we need, a declaration that the Feds are out of control.
[3:09:23.060 --> 3:09:25.780]  I mean, they're federalizing everything with our tax money.
[3:09:25.780 --> 3:09:29.580]  They take our money and send a few cents of it back with controls.
[3:09:29.580 --> 3:09:33.420]  Steamed over a perceived increase in federal usurpment of state's rights, Oklahoma House
[3:09:33.420 --> 3:09:36.260]  Representatives told Washington DC to back off.
[3:09:36.260 --> 3:09:42.300]  Joint resolution 1089 passed by an overwhelming 92 to 3 margin.
[3:09:42.300 --> 3:09:46.020]  North Oklahoma's sovereignty under the 10th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, and according
[3:09:46.020 --> 3:09:50.620]  to the resolution's own language, is serving notice to the federal government to cease
[3:09:50.620 --> 3:09:55.500]  and assist certain mandates, the 10th Amendment states, the powers not delegated to the United
[3:09:55.500 --> 3:09:59.820]  States by the Constitution nor prohibited to by the states are reserved to the states
[3:09:59.820 --> 3:10:02.220]  respectively or to the people.
[3:10:02.220 --> 3:10:06.060]  Charles Key, the Republican state representative who authored the resolution to World Ant Daily,
[3:10:06.060 --> 3:10:09.420]  they introduced it because he believes the federal government's overstepping its bounds
[3:10:09.420 --> 3:10:12.860]  has put our Constitution in the form of government in danger.
[3:10:12.860 --> 3:10:16.460]  And so he's the guy that got it passed 92 to 3.
[3:10:16.460 --> 3:10:18.780]  I'd like to know who those three are.
[3:10:18.780 --> 3:10:23.020]  And stuff happened with members of the legislature and with the local mayor where they would
[3:10:23.020 --> 3:10:27.020]  say, oh, I don't know anything about a North American Union, and then they'd catch them
[3:10:27.020 --> 3:10:29.780]  as signatories to it five years ago.
[3:10:29.780 --> 3:10:32.380]  So a lot of that has got Oklahomans up in arms.
[3:10:32.380 --> 3:10:37.980]  I wish we had people in our legislature like Charles Key here in Texas where they're really
[3:10:37.980 --> 3:10:41.020]  raping the daylights out of us, the feds are.
[3:10:41.020 --> 3:10:43.500]  But Charles Key, thank you so much for coming on with us.
[3:10:43.500 --> 3:10:46.580]  Hey, it's good to be with you again, Alex.
[3:10:46.580 --> 3:10:48.860]  You know, you've got the floor here for the next 50 minutes.
[3:10:48.860 --> 3:10:54.860]  Tell me about the Oklahoma City bombing website, this website, your site, what you're doing.
[3:10:54.860 --> 3:11:00.140]  But after you do that, let's get in to this resolution and why it's a ray of hope.
[3:11:00.140 --> 3:11:06.100]  Well, you know this and just for some of your listeners to know, I have, I'm in my second
[3:11:06.100 --> 3:11:11.620]  tenure in the legislature, had a previous life in the 80s and 90s in the legislature,
[3:11:11.620 --> 3:11:15.180]  and I was out for about eight years, and I didn't really plan on running again.
[3:11:15.180 --> 3:11:22.540]  What I did in 06, and here I am, and the reason you had me on the show today, HGR 1089, which
[3:11:22.540 --> 3:11:27.180]  is the 10th Amendment resolution, did pass the House this year.
[3:11:27.180 --> 3:11:28.180]  But it's not brand new.
[3:11:28.180 --> 3:11:33.300]  It's new to a lot of people, but it actually started back in the very early 90s.
[3:11:33.300 --> 3:11:38.220]  There was a state senator from Colorado named Charles Duke, and he started it.
[3:11:38.220 --> 3:11:42.820]  He gets credited with starting the 10th Amendment resolution, but he and myself back then and
[3:11:42.820 --> 3:11:47.460]  a number of other legislators in other state legislatures introduced it in their state
[3:11:47.460 --> 3:11:49.380]  legislatures and passed it back then.
[3:11:49.380 --> 3:11:51.820]  I passed it in the Oklahoma House back in 1994.
[3:11:51.820 --> 3:11:52.820]  Yeah.
[3:11:52.820 --> 3:11:53.820]  Let's be clear.
[3:11:53.820 --> 3:11:56.620]  You guys passed that and said the UN's not coming in here.
[3:11:56.620 --> 3:12:00.340]  We're not putting up with land grabs and boom, a little bombing happened to teach you to
[3:12:00.340 --> 3:12:02.500]  love the feds.
[3:12:02.500 --> 3:12:08.500]  18 times back then, and I'd love to take credit for it this time this year, but it does have
[3:12:08.500 --> 3:12:13.180]  a history that goes back into the 90s, but it's something we definitely, we must get
[3:12:13.180 --> 3:12:17.860]  out there and get every state to pass this same resolution.
[3:12:17.860 --> 3:12:22.300]  And I tell you, I've got a lot of legislators that are contacting me and saying they want
[3:12:22.300 --> 3:12:24.860]  to do the same thing in their legislature this next year.
[3:12:24.860 --> 3:12:28.100]  I mean, even if you've got some people down there in Texas.
[3:12:28.100 --> 3:12:29.100]  Wow.
[3:12:29.100 --> 3:12:31.460]  Now, I didn't know that.
[3:12:31.460 --> 3:12:35.980]  I don't want to put you on the spot, but do you have in front of you who they are?
[3:12:35.980 --> 3:12:39.620]  Have their approval to talk about it on a public broadcast.
[3:12:39.620 --> 3:12:42.300]  So just out of deference to them, I think it'd probably be better if I didn't mention
[3:12:42.300 --> 3:12:46.180]  their names, but I guarantee you there's some real interest in the Texas legislature.
[3:12:46.180 --> 3:12:47.180]  Gotcha.
[3:12:47.180 --> 3:12:48.180]  We want to sneak up on them.
[3:12:48.180 --> 3:12:49.180]  That makes sense.
[3:12:49.180 --> 3:12:52.900]  Tell folks, I've got it here in front of me, but tell them where they can find the resolution
[3:12:52.900 --> 3:12:57.140]  to try to give it to their legislatures and tell us what's in the resolution, why it's
[3:12:57.140 --> 3:12:58.140]  so important.
[3:12:58.140 --> 3:13:05.620]  Well, first of all, they could email me at Charles.key at okayhouse.gov and request
[3:13:05.620 --> 3:13:06.620]  a copy.
[3:13:06.620 --> 3:13:10.780]  I would be glad to send it to them or they can go to the Oklahoma House of Representatives
[3:13:10.780 --> 3:13:11.780]  website.
[3:13:11.780 --> 3:13:12.780]  That's really easy to find.
[3:13:12.780 --> 3:13:15.100]  And it's a very user-friendly website.
[3:13:15.100 --> 3:13:23.660]  And just look up HJR1089 and you can download your own copy of it.
[3:13:23.660 --> 3:13:29.020]  Tell us about some of the pun intended key areas of the legislation.
[3:13:29.020 --> 3:13:33.460]  Well, you know, you pretty much described in the opening, it just simply reiterates
[3:13:33.460 --> 3:13:37.820]  what the 10th Amendment says and says, federal government, get back into your proper role
[3:13:37.820 --> 3:13:41.940]  and stop getting into areas that you have no legal authority to be into.
[3:13:41.940 --> 3:13:45.500]  And my gosh, the list, you know, we don't have enough time in an hour.
[3:13:45.500 --> 3:13:49.060]  We'd have to spend all day long talking about what the federal government's done and venturing
[3:13:49.060 --> 3:13:51.060]  into areas that have no legal authority.
[3:13:51.060 --> 3:13:55.100]  You go over some of the most egregious and why your state's upset.
[3:13:55.100 --> 3:14:01.900]  Well, you've got the, you know, you've got the violations of privacy, the Fourth Amendment,
[3:14:01.900 --> 3:14:04.980]  because of bills like the Patriot Act and all the other ones that we've already forgot
[3:14:04.980 --> 3:14:10.220]  the names of them in which they've tried and they have, I like to say, tried to restrict
[3:14:10.220 --> 3:14:11.220]  our rights.
[3:14:11.220 --> 3:14:16.380]  Of course, they have, but you know, I have to be one that I don't believe in saying,
[3:14:16.380 --> 3:14:21.460]  well, they're, they, they got us again, you know, they've eliminated another amendment.
[3:14:21.460 --> 3:14:26.700]  I think the supreme law of the land is just that, it's the supreme law of the land.
[3:14:26.700 --> 3:14:27.700]  I agree.
[3:14:27.700 --> 3:14:31.100]  It's still there just because they're criminal doesn't mean I'm still on a free human being.
[3:14:31.100 --> 3:14:32.100]  Yeah.
[3:14:32.100 --> 3:14:34.940]  Just because they passed some bill that mean all of a sudden they superseded it or something.
[3:14:34.940 --> 3:14:38.060]  They got rid of it, but you know, you've got privacy.
[3:14:38.060 --> 3:14:40.660]  You've got the surveillance.
[3:14:40.660 --> 3:14:43.620]  You've got ventures into the area of education.
[3:14:43.620 --> 3:14:47.500]  You know, they're telling people what to do and how to educate their kids from Washington,
[3:14:47.500 --> 3:14:52.660]  DC, tying funds to it to try to, you know, and all the problems started when the feds
[3:14:52.660 --> 3:14:53.660]  got involved.
[3:14:53.660 --> 3:14:54.660]  Yeah.
[3:14:54.660 --> 3:14:55.660]  It just gets worse.
[3:14:55.660 --> 3:14:56.660]  It doesn't get better.
[3:14:56.660 --> 3:15:01.740]  Um, hate crimes, um, you know, they had a bill this last year, what that, that gave
[3:15:01.740 --> 3:15:05.820]  a lot of money to hire more law enforcement officers.
[3:15:05.820 --> 3:15:08.900]  They don't have any right to, to be doing that's not their role.
[3:15:08.900 --> 3:15:11.100]  They're right to be in that, that particular area.
[3:15:11.100 --> 3:15:15.460]  Well, I hear people all the time on talk radio, even so-called conservatives say, but it's
[3:15:15.460 --> 3:15:16.460]  free money.
[3:15:16.460 --> 3:15:17.460]  No.
[3:15:17.460 --> 3:15:21.460]  Uh, in fact, uh, from what I've seen, federal money is the most, even if you agree with
[3:15:21.460 --> 3:15:24.460]  the programs, which we don't, I mean, it is the most wasteful.
[3:15:24.460 --> 3:15:25.700]  It's our money.
[3:15:25.700 --> 3:15:26.700]  Yeah.
[3:15:26.700 --> 3:15:27.700]  You know what?
[3:15:27.700 --> 3:15:32.460]  There was an idea that, uh, came up back in those early and middle nineties when some
[3:15:32.460 --> 3:15:38.220]  of us back then were looking at what we could do to thwart the activity of the federal
[3:15:38.220 --> 3:15:41.460]  government in unconstitutional areas.
[3:15:41.460 --> 3:15:44.820]  And this idea came up, if anybody's listening out there that might want to pass us on to
[3:15:44.820 --> 3:15:48.780]  a legislator or some of the legislators that are listening to this program or people running
[3:15:48.780 --> 3:15:55.140]  for office, you know, it is our money and they're taking it and directing it back to
[3:15:55.140 --> 3:15:57.780]  the States with kind of a carrot stick approach.
[3:15:57.780 --> 3:16:00.060]  Uh, you do this, we'll give you this money.
[3:16:00.060 --> 3:16:02.780]  Then once you get hooked into the deal, then they'll take the money away and they should
[3:16:02.780 --> 3:16:04.220]  keep doing it and do more.
[3:16:04.220 --> 3:16:05.220]  Yeah.
[3:16:05.220 --> 3:16:06.220]  Unfunded mandates.
[3:16:06.220 --> 3:16:07.220]  Yeah.
[3:16:07.220 --> 3:16:11.100]  And what if the state said, okay, look, we're going to start requiring our people within
[3:16:11.100 --> 3:16:17.700]  the state to send certain federal taxes to us through the state treasury, and then we'll
[3:16:17.700 --> 3:16:20.940]  pass it on up to the federal government.
[3:16:20.940 --> 3:16:26.300]  And this is a real good money generating the revenue generating idea, by the way, the states
[3:16:26.300 --> 3:16:30.940]  would have some short-term interest they'd make on that money as they floated through.
[3:16:30.940 --> 3:16:34.780]  And that might really help some states out, but it would also allow the states to say
[3:16:34.780 --> 3:16:40.340]  to the federal government when they start pushing more unfunded mandates and unconstitutional
[3:16:40.340 --> 3:16:44.260]  acts to say, well, maybe we won't send that money up back up to you.
[3:16:44.260 --> 3:16:45.260]  We'll just keep it.
[3:16:45.260 --> 3:16:46.260]  Oh, man.
[3:16:46.260 --> 3:16:52.380]  Maybe the states need to start doing something like that because it is our money.
[3:16:52.380 --> 3:16:53.700]  Well it certainly is.
[3:16:53.700 --> 3:16:58.820]  Uh, what are some other areas that you think are important people know about dealing with
[3:16:58.820 --> 3:17:01.900]  the, uh, declaration?
[3:17:01.900 --> 3:17:07.220]  Well, um, you know, the big issues out there, well, the big issues that have been talked
[3:17:07.220 --> 3:17:11.900]  about for several years, I think, uh, it's gotten prominent again this time around because
[3:17:11.900 --> 3:17:17.900]  the Ron Paul campaign is the money issue, the authority given to the Federal Reserve,
[3:17:17.900 --> 3:17:22.180]  Private Federal Reserve Bank to have control over just about every aspect of our lives
[3:17:22.180 --> 3:17:24.700]  having to do with finances and money.
[3:17:24.700 --> 3:17:28.940]  That is proving and finally proving to be a really big problem.
[3:17:28.940 --> 3:17:33.500]  They don't have the authority to do that, it's unconstitutional and that needs to be
[3:17:33.500 --> 3:17:34.500]  addressed.
[3:17:34.500 --> 3:17:37.780]  Well, now they're saying the Federal Reserve's issued so much currency and liquidity that
[3:17:37.780 --> 3:17:39.740]  the dollar is going to be like toilet paper.
[3:17:39.740 --> 3:17:43.660]  Yeah, well, it's, you know, it's, it seems to be heading that way.
[3:17:43.660 --> 3:17:45.700]  I mean, it's pretty bad right now.
[3:17:45.700 --> 3:17:50.700]  What amazes me and really makes me mad is a lot of these talking head pundits and people
[3:17:50.700 --> 3:17:55.020]  in both parties that make boo-koos of money and been living off the system for a long
[3:17:55.020 --> 3:17:56.020]  time.
[3:17:56.020 --> 3:18:00.620]  They have a clue how tough it is for the average middle and lower income person out here trying
[3:18:00.620 --> 3:18:01.620]  to get by.
[3:18:01.620 --> 3:18:04.580]  And they think everybody's still making a couple of hundred thousand or more dollars
[3:18:04.580 --> 3:18:07.980]  a year and, and everything's real, real rosy.
[3:18:07.980 --> 3:18:12.820]  But the country is hurting right now and it can get a lot worse than it might, but that
[3:18:12.820 --> 3:18:17.860]  needs to be fixed and the answer is not to print more dollars up and throw a few, you
[3:18:17.860 --> 3:18:22.820]  know, coins back towards the folks with some type of a tax rebate or something.
[3:18:22.820 --> 3:18:24.220]  But that issue needs to be addressed.
[3:18:24.220 --> 3:18:27.300]  We've also got the problem of just taxation itself.
[3:18:27.300 --> 3:18:31.020]  The federal income tax is a, is a bad tax.
[3:18:31.020 --> 3:18:33.900]  It's not, it's not a legal tax.
[3:18:33.900 --> 3:18:39.220]  Supreme court wants that our history at least has ruled that it was not constitutional.
[3:18:39.220 --> 3:18:47.540]  If a court had the, had the, uh, oh, what, the courage or the, um, will, will, the constitutional
[3:18:47.540 --> 3:18:52.860]  uh, knowledge or whatever it, whatever it is, holding them back from really on this
[3:18:52.860 --> 3:18:53.860]  issue.
[3:18:53.860 --> 3:18:55.700]  Maybe they just need an opportunity.
[3:18:55.700 --> 3:18:58.860]  They ought to rule again that the federal income tax is unconstitutional.
[3:18:58.860 --> 3:18:59.860]  Absolutely tax.
[3:18:59.860 --> 3:19:05.300]  And you know, it's just hard to believe that a state would have to pass a resolution saying
[3:19:05.300 --> 3:19:09.660]  the state of Oklahoma hereby claims sovereignty under the 10th amendment to the constitution
[3:19:09.660 --> 3:19:14.460]  in the United States over all powers on otherwise enumerated and granted to the federal government
[3:19:14.460 --> 3:19:16.660]  by the constitution United States.
[3:19:16.660 --> 3:19:20.780]  And you serve notice and demand of the federal government as our agent, the cease and desist
[3:19:20.780 --> 3:19:24.980]  effective immediately mandates that are beyond the scope of these constitutionally delegated
[3:19:24.980 --> 3:19:28.780]  powers like federalizing local police.
[3:19:28.780 --> 3:19:31.020]  I mean folks, the government is out of control.
[3:19:31.020 --> 3:19:34.940]  The federal government, it's like a neighbor who's in your house telling you what to do.
[3:19:34.940 --> 3:19:39.140]  I mean, it is out of control and we'll be right back with state rep Charles Key, a great
[3:19:39.140 --> 3:19:45.780]  guy will cover some other subjects as well.
[3:19:45.780 --> 3:19:49.860]  Did you know that pH balance is one of the most important factors in maintaining high
[3:19:49.860 --> 3:19:51.860]  energy and vibrant health?
[3:19:51.860 --> 3:19:57.060]  Most experts agree that the water you drink should be at a pH level of 9 or higher.
[3:19:57.060 --> 3:20:01.980]  Plasma pH drops combine a unique formula of the most alkaline minerals and elements.
[3:20:01.980 --> 3:20:05.980]  This product is a one of a kind in its strength and effectiveness.
[3:20:05.980 --> 3:20:10.940]  Using plasma pH drops is one of the best ways to make your water alkaline while helping
[3:20:10.940 --> 3:20:14.420]  you get rid of acid and regaining your health and energy.
[3:20:14.420 --> 3:20:20.620]  With just 10 drops, you can raise the pH level of the water you drink up to the pH of 10.
[3:20:20.620 --> 3:20:25.260]  Alkalizing water helps the body rid itself of acidic waste and increases the oxygen content
[3:20:25.260 --> 3:20:26.420]  of your body.
[3:20:26.420 --> 3:20:31.500]  Disease organisms like bacteria and cancer cannot survive in an alkaline environment.

[3:20:45.380 --> 3:20:48.940]  Hello Ted Anderson, listeners of the network are familiar with the Federal Reserve note
[3:20:48.940 --> 3:20:51.460]  and understand the risks of deficit spending.
[3:20:51.460 --> 3:20:55.660]  Therefore, with catastrophic events, it comes as no surprise that some banks have currently
[3:20:55.660 --> 3:20:59.300]  placed limits on the amount of cash depositors can remove from their accounts.
[3:20:59.300 --> 3:21:03.660]  A fractional reserve system means only a small portion of your deposit is held in reserve
[3:21:03.660 --> 3:21:05.340]  for immediate withdrawal.
[3:21:05.340 --> 3:21:09.380]  Dispending will skyrocket through FDIC if the government is forced to ensure deposits
[3:21:09.380 --> 3:21:12.180]  during a bank run followed by a depressed economy.
[3:21:12.180 --> 3:21:16.700]  A current effort is underway by the Fed along with other central banks to increase liquidity
[3:21:16.700 --> 3:21:17.700]  for depositors.
[3:21:17.700 --> 3:21:22.020]  However, an increase in money supply without equal expansion and productivity can cause
[3:21:22.020 --> 3:21:23.020]  inflation.
[3:21:23.020 --> 3:21:27.260]  In order to achieve strength and stability, I recommend a conservative portion of all
[3:21:27.260 --> 3:21:30.980]  investments to be calmly repositioned into gold and silver.
[3:21:30.980 --> 3:21:35.660]  While paper investments currently have been driven by debt, gold on its own has held value
[3:21:35.660 --> 3:21:37.460]  for over 6,000 years.

[3:23:50.300 --> 3:24:00.020]  Waging war on corruption, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[3:24:00.020 --> 3:24:01.020]  State Rep.
[3:24:01.020 --> 3:24:02.020]  Charles Key is our guest.
[3:24:02.020 --> 3:24:04.460]  We talk about courage.
[3:24:04.460 --> 3:24:09.780]  From day one when there was the questions coming out with Oklahoma City bombing, which was
[3:24:09.780 --> 3:24:17.180]  an inside job from the beginning, he was there questioning, exposing, speaking out.
[3:24:17.180 --> 3:24:24.700]  And now in hindsight, talking 12 years later or more, it's just all coming out.
[3:24:24.700 --> 3:24:29.140]  It is all coming out in a big way, so I want to shift years into that for the rest of the
[3:24:29.140 --> 3:24:32.660]  interview with our guest today and any other subjects he wants to talk about.
[3:24:32.660 --> 3:24:37.660]  But as a state rep for all our listeners in Oklahoma, please support him.
[3:24:37.660 --> 3:24:40.380]  I mean, I know he was happy to be out of politics.
[3:24:40.380 --> 3:24:41.860]  Why did you get back in?
[3:24:41.860 --> 3:24:44.380]  Well, it was just kind of circumstantial.
[3:24:44.380 --> 3:24:48.900]  There was some people that asked me to run when the guy that was in there just chose
[3:24:48.900 --> 3:24:52.740]  not to run, kind of at the, somewhat at the last minute.
[3:24:52.740 --> 3:24:56.300]  And you know, that was just that simple.
[3:24:56.300 --> 3:25:00.140]  There was another guy running that some of them didn't think he was a conservative, and
[3:25:00.140 --> 3:25:03.780]  they said, we want a conservative in there and we've got to have a conservative and we
[3:25:03.780 --> 3:25:04.780]  want you to run.
[3:25:04.780 --> 3:25:08.260]  And so I thought about it, prayed about it and boom, did it.
[3:25:08.260 --> 3:25:09.260]  And they did the same thing.
[3:25:09.260 --> 3:25:12.900]  They did tell me before they just blew me out of the water about the Oklahoma City bombing,
[3:25:12.900 --> 3:25:15.700]  but we prevailed and God gave us a victory.
[3:25:15.700 --> 3:25:17.780]  So that's, that's just it.
[3:25:17.780 --> 3:25:18.780]  Yeah.
[3:25:18.780 --> 3:25:23.500]  They attack you when most Oklahomans I talked to know what's going on.
[3:25:23.500 --> 3:25:28.900]  Yeah, did that backfire on them that the story's gotten out now and that, that made your competitors
[3:25:28.900 --> 3:25:29.900]  look stupid?
[3:25:29.900 --> 3:25:30.900]  Yeah, I think it is.
[3:25:30.900 --> 3:25:35.500]  I think, you know, it's a lot like the Oklahoma City bombing cases, a lot like JFK, a lot
[3:25:35.500 --> 3:25:39.740]  of other cases that we could enumerate and you talk about on your program half many times.
[3:25:39.740 --> 3:25:44.180]  You know, as time goes by and more of the truth comes out, people have time, the emotional
[3:25:44.180 --> 3:25:49.220]  part of it, you know, subsides, it goes away and people have a chance to, to hear more,
[3:25:49.220 --> 3:25:54.780]  think more and get more facts and they realized that there was a cover up and that's what's
[3:25:54.780 --> 3:25:56.820]  happened in the Oklahoma City bombing case.
[3:25:56.820 --> 3:26:00.260]  Um, yeah, I guess you probably had Jesse Trinidad on your program.
[3:26:00.260 --> 3:26:01.260]  Oh, yes.
[3:26:01.260 --> 3:26:06.060]  And, and that guy, I talk about a, you know, a bulldog and a courageous man.
[3:26:06.060 --> 3:26:10.860]  He has continued to keep this thing alive and he is, you know, he has helped continue
[3:26:10.860 --> 3:26:15.140]  to verify what all of us were saying back in the beginning.
[3:26:15.140 --> 3:26:16.140]  Well, well, that's it.
[3:26:16.140 --> 3:26:19.540]  I mean, 11 years ago, everything you said has turned out your angle on it has turned
[3:26:19.540 --> 3:26:20.540]  out to be right.
[3:26:20.540 --> 3:26:24.340]  Uh, in fact, break down the Jesse Trinidad case for those that may have forgotten because
[3:26:24.340 --> 3:26:25.940]  that was probably six, eight months ago.
[3:26:25.940 --> 3:26:26.940]  We were really talking about this.
[3:26:26.940 --> 3:26:29.580]  I mean, break down all the new things that have been confirmed.
[3:26:29.580 --> 3:26:33.860]  Well, and it's been hard for me to keep on top of it like I did the bombing case when
[3:26:33.860 --> 3:26:36.780]  I was involved in that, but I can get the highlights.
[3:26:36.780 --> 3:26:39.700]  Jesse Trinidad is an attorney up in the Salt Lake City area.
[3:26:39.700 --> 3:26:44.620]  He had a brother who died in Oklahoma City in August of 95.
[3:26:44.620 --> 3:26:49.380]  The bombing happened in April and his brother died in a federal transfer center that happened
[3:26:49.380 --> 3:26:55.460]  to be in my district, by the way, right next to the airport and, um, the, when the family
[3:26:55.460 --> 3:26:59.300]  realized that he didn't commit suicide like the Bureau of Prisons claimed.
[3:26:59.300 --> 3:27:05.500]  So they filed a lawsuit as time went by and they were able to force documents out of the
[3:27:05.500 --> 3:27:08.300]  government through the Freedom of Information Act.
[3:27:08.300 --> 3:27:12.180]  They found out that it was related to the Oklahoma City bombing somehow.
[3:27:12.180 --> 3:27:18.060]  What happened was some federal investigators, FBI and who knows who else thought that he
[3:27:18.060 --> 3:27:24.300]  was a suspect in the Oklahoma City bombing case and, uh, they beat him to death, literally.
[3:27:24.300 --> 3:27:25.820]  And so the family filed a suit.
[3:27:25.820 --> 3:27:30.940]  They eventually won that suit and the, uh, Trinidad and the family have not let go.
[3:27:30.940 --> 3:27:35.700]  They've become impassioned, not just, well, let me just add, he also had electrical burns
[3:27:35.700 --> 3:27:36.700]  all over him.
[3:27:36.700 --> 3:27:37.700]  Yeah.
[3:27:37.700 --> 3:27:38.700]  Go ahead.
[3:27:38.700 --> 3:27:43.180]  And they're impassioned about this, not just because they wanted to, uh, bring justice
[3:27:43.180 --> 3:27:49.140]  to what really happened in regards to their brother and son's murder, but also because
[3:27:49.140 --> 3:27:55.060]  they found out how terrible, terribly screwed up this Oklahoma City bombing case was and
[3:27:55.060 --> 3:27:58.380]  what the, how the truth was really being covered up.
[3:27:58.380 --> 3:28:02.980]  So Jesse Trinidad and, you know, we should also give kudos to a federal judge at the
[3:28:02.980 --> 3:28:03.980]  Salt Lake area.
[3:28:03.980 --> 3:28:09.620]  I think his last name is Kimball has not let the justice department in the FBI off the
[3:28:09.620 --> 3:28:10.620]  hook.
[3:28:10.620 --> 3:28:11.620]  Easy.
[3:28:11.620 --> 3:28:14.140]  It made them have to live under the laws that the rest of us have to live on.
[3:28:14.140 --> 3:28:16.260]  And he said things like, this is a cover up.
[3:28:16.260 --> 3:28:19.500]  I mean, it's amazing to have a, actually have a good federal judge.
[3:28:19.500 --> 3:28:20.500]  Yeah.
[3:28:20.500 --> 3:28:26.420]  You know, even the judge, a mage that presided over McVey and, and Nichols trials even made
[3:28:26.420 --> 3:28:28.580]  a couple of comments like that back early on.
[3:28:28.580 --> 3:28:31.020]  So there's no question about that.
[3:28:31.020 --> 3:28:36.140]  It was a major coverup and it was, there were other people involved and they had a level
[3:28:36.140 --> 3:28:41.140]  at minimum, a level of prior knowledge that something was going to happen.
[3:28:41.140 --> 3:28:46.060]  And you know, there were government informants inside the circle or these circles of individuals
[3:28:46.060 --> 3:28:50.780]  that were, you know, going to carry this out or they were participating in it.
[3:28:50.780 --> 3:28:55.420]  And you know, the list just goes on, but how could you be criticized when you had grand
[3:28:55.420 --> 3:28:58.860]  jurors and people coming to you saying there's other bombers and I'm being told to shut
[3:28:58.860 --> 3:28:59.860]  up.
[3:28:59.860 --> 3:29:03.700]  What's your job as a state rep to speak out?
[3:29:03.700 --> 3:29:08.020]  Well, you know, there are folks that they want to go along.
[3:29:08.020 --> 3:29:12.380]  They're more interested in climbing up a ladder, whether it's politically or corporately or
[3:29:12.380 --> 3:29:13.380]  whatever.
[3:29:13.380 --> 3:29:15.700]  And that's what it gets down to.
[3:29:15.700 --> 3:29:16.700]  Stay there.
[3:29:16.700 --> 3:29:20.180]  I want to run through the basics of what you know about that one, the city bombing and
[3:29:20.180 --> 3:29:22.940]  who you think is really behind it and involved.
[3:29:22.940 --> 3:29:26.460]  We've got a clear picture today that we've ever had before and we'll take calls on the
[3:29:26.460 --> 3:29:34.180]  resolution, throwing the feds out, re-declaring state liberty, 1-800-259-9231 is the toll-free

[3:31:54.100 --> 3:32:00.060]  It's known as the Builder Bird, but their objective being world domination.
[3:32:00.060 --> 3:32:03.220]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[3:32:03.220 --> 3:32:09.140]  Now as they hail the birth of the new world order, their great dream of exterminating 80%
[3:32:09.140 --> 3:32:13.580]  of humanity is at hand.
[3:32:13.580 --> 3:32:19.060]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.

[3:32:26.620 --> 3:32:27.620]  They're not after money.
[3:32:27.620 --> 3:32:28.620]  They have all the money they need.
[3:32:28.620 --> 3:32:29.620]  They're after power.

[3:32:42.340 --> 3:32:44.340]  You have been warned.
[3:32:44.340 --> 3:32:54.340]  Man thinks, cause he rules with us, he can do with it as he please.
[3:32:54.340 --> 3:33:06.340]  And if things don't change soon, he will, for man is invented, he's doomed, the first
[3:33:06.340 --> 3:33:11.740]  step was touching the moon, now there's a woman.
[3:33:11.740 --> 3:33:15.860]  Charles Key's our guest, I'm very thankful for his time today, Steve, Greg, John, Charles,
[3:33:15.860 --> 3:33:16.860]  many others.
[3:33:16.860 --> 3:33:19.140]  We're going to go to your calls here in a few minutes for State Rep.
[3:33:19.140 --> 3:33:20.140]  Charles Key.
[3:33:20.140 --> 3:33:23.740]  When he's done in the state house, we need to send him to Washington.
[3:33:23.740 --> 3:33:26.060]  We need some good people.
[3:33:26.060 --> 3:33:29.660]  In Washington, there's only Ron Paul and a few others up there.
[3:33:29.660 --> 3:33:33.740]  Republicans and conservatives' names have been destroyed thanks to Bush tripling the
[3:33:33.740 --> 3:33:34.740]  size of government.
[3:33:34.740 --> 3:33:38.580]  Now we're looking at Barack Obama or McCain.
[3:33:38.580 --> 3:33:42.820]  Charles, before we get back in Oklahoma City and take calls, sometimes you've got to wonder,
[3:33:42.820 --> 3:33:47.380]  I mean, the elites are just running this country into the ground.
[3:33:47.380 --> 3:33:51.100]  And I'm just wondering if there's any hope the way things are going.
[3:33:51.100 --> 3:33:56.620]  There's hope, if, you know, I think there's always hope, but I feel the same way I get
[3:33:56.620 --> 3:34:01.540]  discouraged and down, but as long as we, you know, we have a certain amount of freedom
[3:34:01.540 --> 3:34:03.980]  and we still do in this country.
[3:34:03.980 --> 3:34:07.820]  But back to the 10th Amendment, you were talking about Oklahoma City bombing and how they could
[3:34:07.820 --> 3:34:13.700]  attack somebody or criticize them for just asking questions and wanting some truth.
[3:34:13.700 --> 3:34:16.980]  We'll look at McCain find gold and a lot of the other things they've done over the past
[3:34:16.980 --> 3:34:23.220]  few years to just try and control your ability to speak freely, like on this radio program.
[3:34:23.220 --> 3:34:26.340]  Because there are those that don't want us to even talk about this.
[3:34:26.340 --> 3:34:27.460]  And that's what they do.
[3:34:27.460 --> 3:34:31.420]  One of the, one of the things they do is they will, they will attack you publicly and call
[3:34:31.420 --> 3:34:38.140]  you all kinds of names, you know, and spin off the truth and tell a lot of untruths.
[3:34:38.140 --> 3:34:42.660]  And since, since the Oklahoma City bombing, just look at the legislation that's been
[3:34:42.660 --> 3:34:48.380]  passed to restrict what you can say and where you can say it, you know, there's what they
[3:34:48.380 --> 3:34:50.460]  call them speech-free zones.
[3:34:50.460 --> 3:34:54.820]  If you get in some of those zones when there's a presidential motorcade or the president's
[3:34:54.820 --> 3:35:00.300]  there or some other political activity that they don't want any protesters to be around,
[3:35:00.300 --> 3:35:01.300]  what do they do?
[3:35:01.300 --> 3:35:02.780]  They'll be off and throw you in jail.
[3:35:02.780 --> 3:35:04.100]  Well, look at Nancy Pelosi.
[3:35:04.100 --> 3:35:08.620]  The first thing they did after, and I'll just say it after the Clintons bombed OKC after
[3:35:08.620 --> 3:35:13.100]  the feds did, the first thing they did was say, we need to bring back the fairness doctrine
[3:35:13.100 --> 3:35:15.500]  and reduce free speech on talk radio.
[3:35:15.500 --> 3:35:20.100]  They blame talk radio and now Pelosi says she wants to bring that back.
[3:35:20.100 --> 3:35:21.100]  Yeah.
[3:35:21.100 --> 3:35:24.540]  And, and I think, you know, I hear more and more people, what's been interesting in my
[3:35:24.540 --> 3:35:30.180]  experience coming back into the legislative political realm this last couple of years is
[3:35:30.180 --> 3:35:36.540]  when I went out and knocked doors in 06 running for this seat again, it was very, very surprising
[3:35:36.540 --> 3:35:41.380]  to me and encouraging, very encouraging how many people going door to door.
[3:35:41.380 --> 3:35:45.740]  These are Republicans are the only doors I knocked that are very aware of what's going
[3:35:45.740 --> 3:35:46.740]  on in this country.
[3:35:46.740 --> 3:35:47.740]  There's a great awakening going on.
[3:35:47.740 --> 3:35:51.300]  Well, see, that's what I was going to ask you next, whereas things are getting darkest
[3:35:51.300 --> 3:35:53.420]  before the dawn, I'm saying they're bad.
[3:35:53.420 --> 3:35:57.860]  I'm finding the same thing that people finally are knowing, they're finally listening.
[3:35:57.860 --> 3:35:59.300]  Go ahead and finish your story.
[3:35:59.300 --> 3:36:03.340]  Tell me what happened when you knocked on those doors that people, people are aware.
[3:36:03.340 --> 3:36:08.260]  They're getting their information from someplace other than the nightly news and the newspaper
[3:36:08.260 --> 3:36:11.720]  and they're starting to find out that they're getting lied to and there's something really
[3:36:11.720 --> 3:36:15.460]  rotten in Denmark, so to speak, and they're waking up.
[3:36:15.460 --> 3:36:16.460]  They understand part of it.
[3:36:16.460 --> 3:36:21.020]  A lot of this is, is pretty obvious stuff like when you've got the immigration problems
[3:36:21.020 --> 3:36:26.380]  like we have and you've got a government that refuses to do something about it or so many
[3:36:26.380 --> 3:36:31.980]  and all, hey, I've got news articles where the police admit that the legal can be drunk
[3:36:31.980 --> 3:36:34.020]  and they don't arrest them, but they arrest me.
[3:36:34.020 --> 3:36:36.380]  Now they should arrest me, but they won't arrest them.
[3:36:36.380 --> 3:36:38.380]  I mean, they're like superclass.
[3:36:38.380 --> 3:36:40.140]  They arrest congressmen who are drunk.
[3:36:40.140 --> 3:36:44.140]  Well, you know, there's so many people and this, this is a part of the answer to what
[3:36:44.140 --> 3:36:48.460]  happened in the Oklahoma city case when they came after me and other cases that other people
[3:36:48.460 --> 3:36:49.940]  have been involved in.
[3:36:49.940 --> 3:36:53.660]  There's always a section of people and I talked about this on your program years ago.
[3:36:53.660 --> 3:36:57.540]  There's always a percentage of the people when they hear things like a cover up about
[3:36:57.540 --> 3:37:01.500]  Oklahoma city or anything else, they do not want to hear it.
[3:37:01.500 --> 3:37:07.420]  They put so much fear into them and their reaction is they want to kill the messenger
[3:37:07.420 --> 3:37:08.420]  and they'll go along.
[3:37:08.420 --> 3:37:14.100]  They'll be cheerleaders and accomplices with those who attacked the messenger and that's
[3:37:14.100 --> 3:37:18.740]  how they accomplished what they accomplished, but even those people will wake up as time
[3:37:18.740 --> 3:37:23.420]  goes on because they'll come out of their denial because after a while they'll see,
[3:37:23.420 --> 3:37:27.940]  and this is what I think I'm seeing today, more people starting to wake up and realize
[3:37:27.940 --> 3:37:31.660]  hey, there really is something to X, you know, or what he said, or what.
[3:37:31.660 --> 3:37:35.160]  Well, I agree with you because what I run into is there's a certain amount of people
[3:37:35.160 --> 3:37:38.420]  who want to live in denial and say, everything's fine, no matter what's going on.
[3:37:38.420 --> 3:37:39.420]  They say we're being negative.
[3:37:39.420 --> 3:37:40.420]  No, no, no.
[3:37:40.420 --> 3:37:43.980]  We're trying to protect what's good by admitting what's bad.
[3:37:43.980 --> 3:37:46.660]  You know, it's like if I have a fly in my soup, I don't say, oh, I'm not going to be
[3:37:46.660 --> 3:37:47.660]  negative and eat it.
[3:37:47.660 --> 3:37:49.140]  I take the fly out.
[3:37:49.140 --> 3:37:54.140]  Well, one of our investigators used this analogy, and I love it, I've used it a lot of times
[3:37:54.140 --> 3:37:56.580]  back when we were investigating the bombing.
[3:37:56.580 --> 3:38:02.420]  He was a retired officer in the Marine Corps, a good guy, and he said, you know, he said
[3:38:02.420 --> 3:38:04.580]  Charles, I bet it's like, it's like a ship.
[3:38:04.580 --> 3:38:08.260]  He says most people don't know this when a ship starts taking on water in the ocean.
[3:38:08.260 --> 3:38:12.100]  You think it would just, you know, you know, going over, but he said it actually gets to
[3:38:12.100 --> 3:38:14.340]  be about 17 degrees.
[3:38:14.340 --> 3:38:15.340]  That's what he said.
[3:38:15.340 --> 3:38:16.860]  I'm assuming that's true or accurate.
[3:38:16.860 --> 3:38:22.100]  He gets to about 17 degrees, and it just flops on over, and he said that's how this public
[3:38:22.100 --> 3:38:26.300]  opinion and things will happen some day is, you know, it'll just keep mounting and mounting
[3:38:26.300 --> 3:38:28.780]  until all of a sudden the people will wake up.
[3:38:28.780 --> 3:38:29.780]  No, I agree.
[3:38:29.780 --> 3:38:30.780]  And that's what they're afraid of.
[3:38:30.780 --> 3:38:32.220]  It's a flash point.
[3:38:32.220 --> 3:38:33.220]  It's a flash point.
[3:38:33.220 --> 3:38:36.460]  It happens in jumps.
[3:38:36.460 --> 3:38:42.620]  And those that are, you know, we recognize that our enemies, their enemies of a constitutional
[3:38:42.620 --> 3:38:47.420]  reform of government, they know that and they're afraid of it.
[3:38:47.420 --> 3:38:49.460]  And we need to use that to our advantage.
[3:38:49.460 --> 3:38:50.460]  I agree.
[3:38:50.460 --> 3:38:51.460]  Well, I'll tell you this.
[3:38:51.460 --> 3:38:54.260]  Globalists just five years ago, six years ago, still were arrogant.
[3:38:54.260 --> 3:38:56.860]  I look at their body language now, I go to events.
[3:38:56.860 --> 3:39:01.060]  They look freaked out, but I don't think it's even freaked out about us as much as it is.
[3:39:01.060 --> 3:39:06.740]  A lot of economists I talked to think they've lost control that they have just totally screwed
[3:39:06.740 --> 3:39:07.740]  everything up.
[3:39:07.740 --> 3:39:08.740]  Yeah.
[3:39:08.740 --> 3:39:11.020]  And that's another thing that wakes people up, unfortunately, because we've heard that,
[3:39:11.020 --> 3:39:14.100]  you know, all of our lives, because it's true that there's a lot of people that never will
[3:39:14.100 --> 3:39:18.540]  wake up until, you know, their back pocket, you know, their pocket books gets hit hard
[3:39:18.540 --> 3:39:20.740]  enough and the people are getting hit hard.
[3:39:20.740 --> 3:39:22.540]  And so a lot of them are going to wake up for that reason.
[3:39:22.540 --> 3:39:24.340]  It's unfortunate.
[3:39:24.340 --> 3:39:26.540]  But if it works for us, that's fine.
[3:39:26.540 --> 3:39:28.940]  You know, we need everything to our advantage that we can get.
[3:39:28.940 --> 3:39:29.940]  Yeah.
[3:39:29.940 --> 3:39:33.660]  But it looks like their pocketbook that if they think this is bad, they ain't seen nothing
[3:39:33.660 --> 3:39:34.660]  yet as they say.
[3:39:34.660 --> 3:39:35.660]  Yeah.
[3:39:35.660 --> 3:39:38.820]  I mean, if this continues, it's going to be unbelievable.
[3:39:38.820 --> 3:39:42.660]  Let's talk to Steven Colorado, you're on the air with Charles Key, State Rep.
[3:39:42.660 --> 3:39:44.380]  Hello there, Alex.
[3:39:44.380 --> 3:39:45.380]  Hi.
[3:39:45.380 --> 3:39:46.900]  Hello, Representative Key.
[3:39:46.900 --> 3:39:51.580]  I think one of the main reasons why people want to shoot the messenger so much is because
[3:39:51.580 --> 3:39:56.620]  they don't want to actually have to believe that their government is degraded into such
[3:39:56.620 --> 3:39:59.180]  a despicable situation.
[3:39:59.180 --> 3:40:02.500]  And then also another reason is because they might actually have to do something with the
[3:40:02.500 --> 3:40:04.260]  knowledge that they found out.
[3:40:04.260 --> 3:40:05.260]  Yeah.
[3:40:05.260 --> 3:40:06.260]  I agree with you.
[3:40:06.260 --> 3:40:09.940]  And then they might find out how bad it's going to be if they don't do something.
[3:40:09.940 --> 3:40:11.540]  Then they really would do something.
[3:40:11.540 --> 3:40:14.540]  Well, that's an interesting point, too.
[3:40:14.540 --> 3:40:23.540]  My questions were, is there, I had heard the story, I guess, about helicopters taking
[3:40:23.540 --> 3:40:29.540]  some of the federal people off the roof of the Murrah building.
[3:40:29.540 --> 3:40:32.260]  Is that, do you know that to be true at all?
[3:40:32.260 --> 3:40:34.340]  I mean, prior to the blast.
[3:40:34.340 --> 3:40:36.420]  No, never found any truth to that.
[3:40:36.420 --> 3:40:42.820]  There were stories that were hearsay, I mean, nothing we could ever really get into.
[3:40:42.820 --> 3:40:44.700]  Why wouldn't they just walk out the front?
[3:40:44.700 --> 3:40:48.180]  Well, because they didn't want to alarm anybody from what I understand.
[3:40:48.180 --> 3:40:52.860]  They went out of rooftop exit by a helicopter, wouldn't alarm people?
[3:40:52.860 --> 3:40:55.260]  Well, that's just what I had heard.
[3:40:55.260 --> 3:40:58.340]  I didn't know for sure whether that was true.
[3:40:58.340 --> 3:40:59.340]  Yeah.
[3:40:59.340 --> 3:41:00.340]  We don't know that.
[3:41:00.340 --> 3:41:05.460]  I don't know if there's any way to ever prove that we worked real hard at that and so many
[3:41:05.460 --> 3:41:09.500]  other clues and information that we had, and we never could.
[3:41:09.500 --> 3:41:14.300]  We had people that said they saw helicopters before the bombing and immediately after the
[3:41:14.300 --> 3:41:19.900]  bombs went off, but there again, you know, proving it and proving that there's anything
[3:41:19.900 --> 3:41:21.780]  connected to the bombing is another thing.
[3:41:21.780 --> 3:41:23.700]  By the way, operative word bombings.
[3:41:23.700 --> 3:41:24.700]  Thank you, Steve.
[3:41:24.700 --> 3:41:26.900]  We know that there were multiple bombs.
[3:41:26.900 --> 3:41:28.980]  Can you explain how you can say that?
[3:41:28.980 --> 3:41:30.900]  Well, there's just too many experts.
[3:41:30.900 --> 3:41:36.100]  You know, this is a subject that is difficult for most people because they don't understand
[3:41:36.100 --> 3:41:38.260]  all this and I was one of those.
[3:41:38.260 --> 3:41:39.260]  I learned a lot.
[3:41:39.260 --> 3:41:43.100]  I learned a lot more than I ever would have, you know, if I had been involved in the bombing,
[3:41:43.100 --> 3:41:46.180]  but you've got experts, people that have done this all their lives like General Parton
[3:41:46.180 --> 3:41:47.180]  and many others.
[3:41:47.180 --> 3:41:51.940]  And we've got some of those in that report that we published that come out and analyze
[3:41:51.940 --> 3:41:53.260]  and this is what they do for a living.
[3:41:53.260 --> 3:41:58.100]  They've done it all their lives in military and in commercial application.
[3:41:58.100 --> 3:42:04.260]  They analyze terrorist bombs, bombings, they analyze tests that they do like an Eglin Air
[3:42:04.260 --> 3:42:09.740]  Force base that's been talked about a lot and they know how these things work and what
[3:42:09.740 --> 3:42:15.180]  will and won't happen and they can analyze a case like this and say, well, here's what
[3:42:15.180 --> 3:42:16.180]  happened.
[3:42:16.180 --> 3:42:20.500]  Here's how many bombs were used and here's where they were placed, et cetera, et cetera.
[3:42:20.500 --> 3:42:28.580]  The experts have looked at it, analyzed it and concluded that multiple bombs were used.
[3:42:28.580 --> 3:42:35.460]  Am I still on?
[3:42:35.460 --> 3:42:38.460]  Okay.
[3:42:38.460 --> 3:42:45.900]  So that's how we know about the number of bombs, people like General Parton and others.
[3:42:45.900 --> 3:42:52.500]  I'm sorry, I was sitting there messing with my board, Representative Key.
[3:42:52.500 --> 3:42:58.300]  Going back to the BATF, what we do know is they showed up in their bomb gear seconds
[3:42:58.300 --> 3:43:03.020]  after the blast and we're telling EMTs and people that showed up to dress wounds and
[3:43:03.020 --> 3:43:06.060]  say that they'd seen them up in the higher floors.
[3:43:06.060 --> 3:43:07.580]  What do you think was behind that?
[3:43:07.580 --> 3:43:12.900]  Well, that's pretty interesting, you know, you had an AP report that's been around for
[3:43:12.900 --> 3:43:21.140]  a long time and he gave that testimony on videotape that he was immediately on the scene
[3:43:21.140 --> 3:43:28.420]  and he said immediately these ATF officials showed up with the black gear, you know, all
[3:43:28.420 --> 3:43:34.700]  decked out in their black SWAT team type gear, like they were poised ready for this to happen
[3:43:34.700 --> 3:43:37.900]  and that's where that information comes from.
[3:43:37.900 --> 3:43:44.020]  So related to that is the Oklahoma City Fire Department getting some call the Friday before
[3:43:44.020 --> 3:43:50.580]  the Wednesday bombing about them being in a higher prepared state for something that
[3:43:50.580 --> 3:43:53.380]  may be developing over the next several days.
[3:43:53.380 --> 3:43:57.500]  And then then we also have the BATF out at a base testing blowing up trucks.
[3:43:57.500 --> 3:44:03.660]  Yeah, that and New Mexico were blowing up trucks with amphobombs.
[3:44:03.660 --> 3:44:07.020]  Very interesting also to say the least.
[3:44:07.020 --> 3:44:10.100]  And this is in the months before and of course, you're not just saying the experts say multiple
[3:44:10.100 --> 3:44:14.940]  bombs or how does a truck bomb not blow the pillars out right in front of the pillars,
[3:44:14.940 --> 3:44:18.260]  the same size way back in the back of the building and then why were chunks of it blown
[3:44:18.260 --> 3:44:22.740]  across the street and why were there blast points on the on the on the rebar?
[3:44:22.740 --> 3:44:24.460]  I mean, all of that.
[3:44:24.460 --> 3:44:28.260]  You also have the governor coming on who obviously wasn't involved because he was, you know,
[3:44:28.260 --> 3:44:31.420]  we he would he or he wouldn't have been saying this yet.
[3:44:31.420 --> 3:44:36.540]  We found multiple bombs, very sophisticated bombs inside and then the BATF shows up and
[3:44:36.540 --> 3:44:38.700]  says, no, that's not what you saw.
[3:44:38.700 --> 3:44:39.700]  Yeah.
[3:44:39.700 --> 3:44:41.980]  And then you had another bomb expert.
[3:44:41.980 --> 3:44:45.420]  I mean, they've got a bunch of them, but you have another terrorism and bomb expert
[3:44:45.420 --> 3:44:48.180]  that was on one of the local stations that came in studio.
[3:44:48.180 --> 3:44:52.140]  Just, you know, a few hours after the bombing, it was reporting also that yeah, that we've
[3:44:52.140 --> 3:44:56.260]  just found out that they found other unexploded bombs that they've taken out of the building
[3:44:56.260 --> 3:45:01.420]  and this is really great because as they take these apart, it's going to help us find
[3:45:01.420 --> 3:45:05.580]  out who did it and be able to track them down, held them accountable, blah, blah, blah.
[3:45:05.580 --> 3:45:07.860]  So, you know, just all kinds of information like that.
[3:45:07.860 --> 3:45:11.700]  I tell you, some of the stuff that Jesse Trinidad, the attorney we were talking about earlier
[3:45:11.700 --> 3:45:18.820]  has been a force out that further sheds light on this case is the information about Andri
[3:45:18.820 --> 3:45:24.060]  Andreas or otherwise known as Andy Strossmeyer, the West German that came over to this country
[3:45:24.060 --> 3:45:29.780]  and certainly was here with the knowledge of our government, maybe even officially working
[3:45:29.780 --> 3:45:34.700]  for them on some level, but he was certainly knowledgeable about this and was working with
[3:45:34.700 --> 3:45:39.420]  McVeigh and other people and some of the documents that they've been able to pull out over the
[3:45:39.420 --> 3:45:43.900]  last two or three or four years confirm that.
[3:45:43.900 --> 3:45:49.540]  And oh yeah, the Southern Poverty Law Center involved, I mean, it's just despicable activities,
[3:45:49.540 --> 3:45:52.340]  but they've got to get our guns one way or the other.
[3:45:52.340 --> 3:45:53.340]  Just amazing.
[3:45:53.340 --> 3:45:57.900]  And then the fact that McVeigh was a government operative coming out in half of David's, it's
[3:45:57.900 --> 3:45:58.900]  just incredible.
[3:45:58.900 --> 3:46:01.220]  Greg in New Jersey, you're on the year.
[3:46:01.220 --> 3:46:02.220]  Go ahead.
[3:46:02.220 --> 3:46:06.620]  Well, thank you very much and thank you for putting me on.
[3:46:06.620 --> 3:46:13.060]  It's kind of ironic here in Oklahoma, they're staying their rights to be left alone from
[3:46:13.060 --> 3:46:18.060]  the federal government and here in New Jersey, which is no doubt our representative government
[3:46:18.060 --> 3:46:20.900]  in the state is the criminal syndicate.
[3:46:20.900 --> 3:46:25.460]  We actually have the U.S. attorney doing the work that New Jersey's attorney should
[3:46:25.460 --> 3:46:26.460]  be doing.
[3:46:26.460 --> 3:46:29.540]  We have 1,000 attorneys working for the state government in New Jersey, yet they have to
[3:46:29.540 --> 3:46:34.580]  use the federal U.S. attorney to prosecute the corrupt politicians that are here.
[3:46:34.580 --> 3:46:36.580]  So far, they've nailed like the mayor of Newark.
[3:46:36.580 --> 3:46:37.580]  Well, that's another problem.
[3:46:37.580 --> 3:46:39.820]  They'll never go after locals with the state.
[3:46:39.820 --> 3:46:44.740]  It's like it's supposedly the purview of the feds who are even more corrupt, very dangerous
[3:46:44.740 --> 3:46:46.740]  violation of state's rights.
[3:46:46.740 --> 3:46:47.740]  Mr. Key?
[3:46:47.740 --> 3:46:54.420]  Yeah, it's unfortunate I had somebody on another program several days ago call me up and talk
[3:46:54.420 --> 3:47:01.580]  about the civil rights laws and how the feds had to come in and prosecute people for racial
[3:47:01.580 --> 3:47:04.060]  types of crimes and what have you.
[3:47:04.060 --> 3:47:05.060]  So that's a tough issue.
[3:47:05.060 --> 3:47:10.620]  You get down the path, you buy into the federal government having a good role and the only
[3:47:10.620 --> 3:47:15.900]  one that can fix, you know, make some wrongs right and it kind of gets things all screwed
[3:47:15.900 --> 3:47:16.900]  up.
[3:47:16.900 --> 3:47:19.500]  Well, they play that game in Europe where the nations, they won't let the people ever
[3:47:19.500 --> 3:47:23.020]  go to those courts, they've got to go to the EU court.
[3:47:23.020 --> 3:47:26.700]  And so it's, it's, it's, it's handing your authority away when you have less control
[3:47:26.700 --> 3:47:27.700]  over the feds.
[3:47:27.700 --> 3:47:28.700]  Anything else, Greg?
[3:47:28.700 --> 3:47:32.180]  Well, I was just, my question was, do you think that's a good thing or a bad thing where
[3:47:32.180 --> 3:47:35.900]  we have to, where we have to actually ask the US attorney to get involved in this?
[3:47:35.900 --> 3:47:39.940]  Yeah, I think it's a bad thing because the feds are even so much more corrupt and they'll
[3:47:39.940 --> 3:47:42.740]  only selectively enforce on who they want.
[3:47:42.740 --> 3:47:45.380]  I mean, I think that really is a state matter.
[3:47:45.380 --> 3:47:50.500]  Well, the problem is always the people not holding their government accountable.
[3:47:50.500 --> 3:47:51.820]  That's always the problem.
[3:47:51.820 --> 3:47:52.820]  Yeah.
[3:47:52.820 --> 3:47:56.220]  They would fix these things at the state level if the people would watch their government
[3:47:56.220 --> 3:47:58.780]  and hold people accountable and make them fix it.
[3:47:58.780 --> 3:47:59.780]  Yeah.
[3:47:59.780 --> 3:48:00.780]  Here's an example.
[3:48:00.780 --> 3:48:02.740]  Who do you go to with the feds engaged in terrorism?
[3:48:02.740 --> 3:48:07.260]  I mean, they admit they staged the USS Liberty, they staged the Gulf of Tonkin, a bunch of
[3:48:07.260 --> 3:48:08.260]  other events.
[3:48:08.260 --> 3:48:10.420]  Who do we go to about our own government staging things?
[3:48:10.420 --> 3:48:14.540]  I mean, going to the feds, you know, whoever's got more power almost always is going to be
[3:48:14.540 --> 3:48:15.540]  more corrupt.
[3:48:15.540 --> 3:48:16.540]  Yeah.
[3:48:16.540 --> 3:48:20.780]  The problem, and another way of stating that too is the problem is, is it assumes that
[3:48:20.780 --> 3:48:25.860]  somehow the federal government is more moral or ethical or something, and they're not.
[3:48:25.860 --> 3:48:29.740]  Just like Alex is saying, you know, they're just people and they're corrupt too, and they're
[3:48:29.740 --> 3:48:35.020]  going to use their power for things other than, you know, what's best for all of us.
[3:48:35.020 --> 3:48:36.020]  Yeah.
[3:48:36.020 --> 3:48:37.020]  Let's take another call.
[3:48:37.020 --> 3:48:38.020]  Thanks, Greg.
[3:48:38.020 --> 3:48:40.020]  John in Fort Worth, Texas, you're on the air with Representative Keith.
[3:48:40.020 --> 3:48:41.020]  Hi.
[3:48:41.020 --> 3:48:42.020]  Thank you for taking my call.
[3:48:42.020 --> 3:48:49.820]  I just wanted to ask the representative, how did, after Oklahoma City, how did the,
[3:48:49.820 --> 3:48:56.420]  in general, the majority of people in Oklahoma, did they go along with the status that was
[3:48:56.420 --> 3:49:01.780]  given to them, or was there a lot of trepidation in what happened?
[3:49:01.780 --> 3:49:08.380]  Well, I think, and I've come to describe it this way, and I think I always probably will,
[3:49:08.380 --> 3:49:13.340]  the answer to that kind of question is that people were traumatized all over the country,
[3:49:13.340 --> 3:49:22.540]  especially right here at ground, at the ground central, or whatever I'm trying to say, right
[3:49:22.540 --> 3:49:27.060]  here where it happened, right here in Oklahoma City, I mean, people were just traumatized
[3:49:27.060 --> 3:49:28.060]  by this.
[3:49:28.060 --> 3:49:32.780]  They had, you know, it was hard to find somebody that didn't know someone or had a relative
[3:49:32.780 --> 3:49:40.020]  that was killed or badly hurt, and then it went on, it didn't just go away after that,
[3:49:40.020 --> 3:49:47.580]  it went on for years, and so people got tired of it, they were emotionally just, uh, wrenched,
[3:49:47.580 --> 3:49:48.580]  you know.
[3:49:48.580 --> 3:49:52.020]  But I mean, how did they deal with all those newscasts, reporting the bombs, and then later
[3:49:52.020 --> 3:49:55.060]  newscasts showing there were Iraqis involved in all this?
[3:49:55.060 --> 3:49:59.540]  I mean, I mean, you would, I mean, when they call you a cook, would you raise those points,
[3:49:59.540 --> 3:50:00.540]  or?
[3:50:00.540 --> 3:50:03.700]  Yeah, and I think most people believed it, but I think it was an emotional thing is
[3:50:03.700 --> 3:50:10.140]  why they eventually go along, you know, they kind of go along with, uh, the, the entities,
[3:50:10.140 --> 3:50:16.220]  whether it's the newspapers or other politicians that attack the messenger, they go along with
[3:50:16.220 --> 3:50:20.700]  them because it's an emotional, yeah, it's too scary, it's too scary to admit the truth.
[3:50:20.700 --> 3:50:26.500]  Thank you, uh, John, uh, Charles New Hampshire, final caller for Representative Charles Key,
[3:50:26.500 --> 3:50:30.420]  uh, coming up after this quick break.
[3:50:30.420 --> 3:50:35.220]  So we've got a final segment coming up straight ahead.
[3:50:35.220 --> 3:50:46.180]  We got a lot of other callers, but we'll see how many we can get in here, okay.
[3:50:46.180 --> 3:50:49.660]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[3:50:49.660 --> 3:50:53.540]  And did you know that you have greater exposure to these chemicals while taking hot showers
[3:50:53.540 --> 3:50:55.140]  than when drinking the water?
[3:50:55.140 --> 3:50:58.980]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate and others are absorbed
[3:50:58.980 --> 3:51:00.140]  into the skin.
[3:51:00.140 --> 3:51:04.740]  The KDF dual media shower filter works with both hot and cold water and it's designed
[3:51:04.740 --> 3:51:10.340]  to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold,
[3:51:10.340 --> 3:51:11.660]  algae and fungus.
[3:51:11.660 --> 3:51:16.540]  The KDF dual media shower filter typically lasts 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever
[3:51:16.540 --> 3:51:21.020]  comes first, hospitals, restaurants and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce
[3:51:21.020 --> 3:51:23.780]  chlorine, iron, heavy metals and bacteria.
[3:51:23.780 --> 3:51:24.780]  What about you?

[3:52:44.780 --> 3:52:47.980]  If you're an adult male, you need to listen to this information.
[3:52:47.980 --> 3:52:52.060]  By the age of 60, half of all men have a prostate related problem.
[3:52:52.060 --> 3:52:57.200]  In the past, many men have turned to sa pometo to support prostate health, but now there's
[3:52:57.200 --> 3:52:58.700]  something much better.
[3:52:58.700 --> 3:53:00.460]  It's called beta prostate.
[3:53:00.460 --> 3:53:05.820]  Beta prostate contains 3,000 times more healthy plant sterols than ordinary sa pometo.
[3:53:05.820 --> 3:53:10.700]  In fact, you'd have to take 100 sa pometo capsules to get the same benefits of one dose
[3:53:10.700 --> 3:53:12.060]  of beta prostate.
[3:53:12.060 --> 3:53:16.620]  It's guaranteed to provide noticeable support even if you're already having prostate related
[3:53:16.620 --> 3:53:17.620]  health issues.
[3:53:17.620 --> 3:53:21.860]  Now you can get Roger Mason's beta prostate formula through this special offer.
[3:53:21.860 --> 3:53:26.460]  And if you call now, you'll learn how to get a free bottle of beta prostate with your order.

[3:53:41.180 --> 3:53:43.180]  That's 1-800-457-9914.
[3:53:43.180 --> 3:53:57.180]  Before you slip into unconsciousness, I'd like to have another kiss, another flashing
[3:53:57.180 --> 3:54:13.180]  chance, another flashing chance, another flashing chance, another flashing chance, another flashing
[3:54:13.180 --> 3:54:14.180]  chance.
[3:54:14.180 --> 3:54:15.180]  Getting you thinking.
[3:54:15.180 --> 3:54:16.180]  That's what we're doing here.
[3:54:16.180 --> 3:54:17.180]  Monday through Friday from 11 to 3 p.m. central.
[3:54:17.180 --> 3:54:18.180]  I'm back Sundays 4 to 6 p.m.
[3:54:18.180 --> 3:54:21.620]  Got loaded phone lines here, but I'll have time to take us to Charles in New Hampshire.
[3:54:21.620 --> 3:54:25.940]  Before we do that, Charles Key, any websites, anything you think people should check into
[3:54:25.940 --> 3:54:27.420]  or learn more from?
[3:54:27.420 --> 3:54:31.220]  I really don't have anything prepared to pass on, Alex.
[3:54:31.220 --> 3:54:36.540]  I just want to thank you for your tireless defense of the Republic, and I just wish we
[3:54:36.540 --> 3:54:38.460]  had more people like you in public service.
[3:54:38.460 --> 3:54:40.060]  I appreciate that very much.
[3:54:40.060 --> 3:54:41.820]  Let's take a final call.
[3:54:41.820 --> 3:54:43.660]  Charles in New Hampshire, go ahead.
[3:54:43.660 --> 3:54:46.260]  Thank you very much for taking my call.
[3:54:46.260 --> 3:54:50.860]  Representative Key, it's just a wonderful surprise and pleasure to know that you're back on
[3:54:50.860 --> 3:54:55.900]  the Hill, 47 years of age, and been around paying attention to these things for quite
[3:54:55.900 --> 3:55:01.620]  some time, and I remember you sticking out back in the Oklahoma bombing as being one
[3:55:01.620 --> 3:55:07.260]  of the few, if not the only one, that was courageous enough to really look into this
[3:55:07.260 --> 3:55:12.700]  thing, and I just can't say how happy I am that you're back along with Representative
[3:55:12.700 --> 3:55:13.700]  Paul.
[3:55:13.700 --> 3:55:21.060]  My inquiry here specifically, because logically and common sense-wise, I remember when they
[3:55:21.060 --> 3:55:26.300]  were able to find out about the Ryder truck with supposedly an unscathed VIN number that
[3:55:26.300 --> 3:55:33.020]  just happened to miraculously survive this huge blast in the Ryder truck, it reminds
[3:55:33.020 --> 3:55:39.100]  me of 19 box cutters at 9-11 that somehow got through the metal detectors, and no one
[3:55:39.100 --> 3:55:45.060]  has been able to bring out a box cutter, at least the metal part of it, where it cuts,
[3:55:45.060 --> 3:55:48.660]  and what I understand in some of the pictures that I see, and I'm still waiting to see a
[3:55:48.660 --> 3:55:54.260]  hole in the ground, and wasn't the Murray Building a nuclear fallout shelter?
[3:55:54.260 --> 3:55:56.940]  It's just certain things common sense don't add up.
[3:55:56.940 --> 3:55:57.940]  Okay, thanks for the call.
[3:55:57.940 --> 3:56:02.180]  Let me get a final comment from Charles Key on that.
[3:56:02.180 --> 3:56:08.700]  Well, there's been a lot of time passed by, so I'm not sure I recall anything like that,
[3:56:08.700 --> 3:56:15.940]  but it did have some lower levels, and it had a lower level parking garage that actually
[3:56:15.940 --> 3:56:18.340]  was, I think, two levels deep below the ground.
[3:56:18.340 --> 3:56:20.580]  I remember the VIN number thing off the car.
[3:56:20.580 --> 3:56:24.940]  Yeah, the VIN number, I mean, there's a lot of odd things that happen in the Oklahoma City
[3:56:24.940 --> 3:56:30.220]  case, and that may be some real good evidence, but not that that's not worthy of talking
[3:56:30.220 --> 3:56:36.100]  about it when I say make my next comment, but the fact is, there's a wealth of information
[3:56:36.100 --> 3:56:41.620]  that proves that there were other people involved that our Justice Department and FBI did not
[3:56:41.620 --> 3:56:46.300]  want to go after those people, they intentionally did not, and to close up with the back to
[3:56:46.300 --> 3:56:51.380]  the Tenth Amendment and the Constitution, we must hold government accountable at every
[3:56:51.380 --> 3:56:57.020]  level if we don't, things get out of control, and not only do they take more of your money,
[3:56:57.020 --> 3:57:02.420]  more of your privacy, freedom of speech, freedom of assembly, and the list goes on, but things
[3:57:02.420 --> 3:57:04.820]  like the Oklahoma City bombing can happen.
[3:57:04.820 --> 3:57:05.820]  Absolutely.
[3:57:05.820 --> 3:57:08.260]  Charles Key, I really appreciate you spending time with us.
[3:57:08.260 --> 3:57:10.980]  I want to get you back up in the near future if you'll give us the time.
[3:57:10.980 --> 3:57:11.980]  Thank you for the time.
[3:57:11.980 --> 3:57:12.980]  Thank you for having me.
[3:57:12.980 --> 3:57:13.980]  Bye-bye.
[3:57:13.980 --> 3:57:14.980]  We're out of time, ladies and gentlemen.
[3:57:14.980 --> 3:57:19.420]  I'm going to be back this Saturday, live, 4 to 6 p.m. then all next week.
[3:57:19.420 --> 3:57:23.620]  Truth Rising is coming out on DVD, you can order it now at ships next week.

[3:58:53.380 --> 3:58:58.180]  family members receive answers to their questions, and the true perpetrators of the horrendous
[3:58:58.180 --> 3:59:00.100]  crime are brought to justice.
