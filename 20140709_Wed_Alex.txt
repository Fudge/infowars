[00:00.000 --> 00:11.480]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well
[00:11.480 --> 00:19.040]  so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin
[00:19.040 --> 00:36.960]  Texas Alex Jones this morning as I was working out I was flipping through
[00:36.960 --> 00:44.160]  channels I was watching the Brazilians go into conniption fits like North
[00:44.160 --> 00:50.200]  Koreans when Kim Jong-il died crying and beating their chest and having
[00:50.200 --> 00:55.560]  national mourning and blaming Mick Jagger for being a bad luck because he
[00:55.560 --> 01:02.960]  rooted for the Brazilian team when the Germans trounced them what 7-1 7-0
[01:02.960 --> 01:07.600]  give me the scores I think it was 7-1 the point here is that I didn't watch
[01:07.600 --> 01:11.320]  it and I don't know and I don't care I'm not against people that want to watch
[01:11.320 --> 01:17.160]  soccer or football whatever it's the mental illness obsession with people's
[01:17.160 --> 01:25.400]  identity being as it was 7-1 being tied up in it and when I was looking at the
[01:25.400 --> 01:29.400]  faces of the men women and children with the sound off so I watched
[01:29.400 --> 01:33.040]  television with the sound off most of the time
[01:33.840 --> 01:38.160]  they literally look like they just got news that their house had burned down
[01:38.160 --> 01:43.800]  whether their grandmother was dead and I know we've talked about the fake
[01:43.800 --> 01:48.680]  culture and people being obsessed with television but I've been watching a
[01:48.680 --> 01:53.680]  little bit more TV lately last night over at some friends houses I had my
[01:53.680 --> 01:57.760]  children with me and we watched some of those naked and afraid shows that are
[01:57.760 --> 02:01.880]  pretty good shows where the people go out and survive we're watching some that
[02:01.880 --> 02:07.040]  have been saved on TVO from months ago about Brazil of all places back to
[02:07.040 --> 02:15.640]  Brazil and the Amazon and how absolutely hellish it is but interspersed we
[02:15.640 --> 02:21.680]  watched three episodes it was all about how being a male in charge makes your
[02:21.680 --> 02:27.640]  rating go down and how being a feminist is how you survive in the jungle and I
[02:27.640 --> 02:33.800]  was just thinking about no matter what show it is dramas reality shows cop
[02:33.800 --> 02:44.680]  shows movies there are messages in them anti-gun anti-liberty anti-male just
[02:44.680 --> 02:51.120]  everything is brainwashing basically and you've got people that are brought up
[02:51.120 --> 02:56.960]  in this who really believe that this is how the world works and that's what
[02:56.960 --> 03:04.600]  creates the slacker society of people that have no ambition don't care if
[03:04.600 --> 03:08.520]  they're losing their freedom don't want to work don't want to have their own
[03:08.520 --> 03:13.120]  business don't want to work for anybody don't want to be self-directed don't
[03:13.120 --> 03:21.960]  want to be directed because they literally are trendy television heads who
[03:21.960 --> 03:26.880]  believe that's reality and what does it do to have the average American watching
[03:26.880 --> 03:30.320]  about six hours of television the average youth upwards of ten hours of
[03:30.320 --> 03:35.000]  television and video games that's the current numbers looking at something
[03:35.000 --> 03:43.680]  that isn't real or is someone else and believing that that's the real universe
[03:43.680 --> 03:52.240]  when it is a bunch of social conditioning and that's why we're in so much
[03:52.240 --> 03:58.080]  trouble and why reality can be turned on its head or inverted and that's why the
[03:58.080 --> 04:02.600]  power structure can pass Obamacare designed to bankrupt the country and
[04:02.600 --> 04:07.200]  hurt poor people on record with death panels and seven taxes on poor people
[04:07.200 --> 04:15.640]  21 taxes total and do all the things to shut the economy down the jobs up the
[04:15.640 --> 04:22.040]  energy prices up the food prices devalue the dollar publicly ship any legals
[04:22.040 --> 04:30.520]  dumping them in cities to bankrupt them and just get away with bloody murder is
[04:30.520 --> 04:36.080]  because a large portion of the public aren't even people now they've been
[04:36.080 --> 04:43.640]  raised as these reactive creatures that think television is the universe and who
[04:43.640 --> 04:48.560]  are really extensions of the television zombies remote control robots
[04:48.560 --> 04:54.680]  literally who just wander around lazily buying whatever they're told I mean

[08:29.880 --> 08:34.000]  ladies and gentlemen thank you for joining us on this live Wednesday the
[08:34.000 --> 08:44.400]  ninth day of July 2014 I'm your host Alex Jones later in the next hour we are
[08:44.400 --> 08:51.280]  going to have our reporters from the ground in Southern California where the
[08:51.280 --> 08:58.280]  churches are now deploying the illegals to Democratic Party members homes who
[08:58.280 --> 09:04.360]  will then get paid by Obama to keep them there kind of like foster children so
[09:04.360 --> 09:09.600]  this is a whole new giant racket of undocumented children that they can be
[09:09.600 --> 09:16.240]  used as mules as money laundering cutouts as welfare pumps I mean this is a
[09:16.240 --> 09:21.800]  giant criminal operation that again is modeled after Acron but I would say we'll
[09:21.800 --> 09:28.120]  end up being let's not exaggerate 15 20 times bigger than Acron and all of their
[09:28.120 --> 09:33.080]  child sex trafficking admissions I mean they're just on video remember those
[09:33.080 --> 09:37.640]  famous videos from four years ago saying he went to Acron after Acron the
[09:37.640 --> 09:44.200]  head of Veritas did and Veritas project James O'Keefe and said hi I want to run
[09:44.200 --> 09:48.040]  Hispanic sex lives through here children they're like all right let's help you get
[09:48.040 --> 09:51.960]  that side up it was he go to the next place and they'd say yeah you got little
[09:51.960 --> 09:57.120]  kids ready to run the op here's how you do it and America just doesn't know how
[09:57.120 --> 10:01.040]  to deal with a hardcore criminal takeover like this that's why they're
[10:01.040 --> 10:04.720]  announcing the Tea Party and gun owners and veterans are terrorists because
[10:04.720 --> 10:08.400]  these people are terrorists that run the government they are hell bent to
[10:08.400 --> 10:12.120]  overthrow the country and wreck everything and break our backs forever so
[10:12.120 --> 10:15.800]  they can have their way and get away with anything they understand that if
[10:15.800 --> 10:19.560]  they can set the precedent to shut off our power plants and double our power
[10:19.560 --> 10:24.200]  prices ship our jobs overseas have the elite not pay taxes but raise taxes on
[10:24.200 --> 10:28.920]  poor people pass Obamacare to bankrupt the country open the border up and order
[10:28.920 --> 10:33.680]  the board of patrol to stand down and ship any legals and masks and pay to
[10:33.680 --> 10:38.720]  ship them in with vouchers for Greyhound to awaiting Democratic Party crime
[10:38.720 --> 10:47.800]  organizations and law firms they can do anything and they will they will tell
[10:47.800 --> 10:55.120]  you they will tell you to not use the word bossy as Michelle Obama did and
[10:55.120 --> 10:59.080]  now people are not using the word bossy they should that she said that is a
[10:59.080 --> 11:02.600]  covert insult to women so I'm gonna tell you not to use it which of course is
[11:02.600 --> 11:09.880]  bossy that art type of a Jezebel spirit by the way this is a sad issue I've
[11:09.880 --> 11:12.680]  always thought Michelle Obama looked like something was wrong with her they
[11:12.680 --> 11:18.040]  talk about how beautiful she is she looks profanely scary and monstrous to
[11:18.040 --> 11:25.240]  me and she always wears these weird fluffy things around her waist and her
[11:25.240 --> 11:30.800]  shoulders are wide enough to put three men's heads on and of course you know
[11:30.800 --> 11:34.600]  the classic thing of a male you could have three heads on a male's shoulders
[11:34.600 --> 11:39.320]  and only another head on a woman's shoulder or one half of a head on each
[11:39.320 --> 11:44.040]  side that's a well-known thing in anatomy and I saw a online video that I
[11:44.040 --> 11:49.640]  may air today and we may look into this talking about Michelle Obama looking
[11:49.640 --> 11:54.240]  like a man and how they only released photos of her with her hands up covering
[11:54.240 --> 11:58.000]  her shoulders or her turn to an angle and I started looking at it with Joan
[11:58.000 --> 12:02.160]  Rivers saying she's a transvestite and I've been here in this for years and I
[12:02.160 --> 12:06.080]  thought come on I know Obama was raised by a transvestite and the rest of it and
[12:06.080 --> 12:10.200]  I'm not getting into bashing people that's not my cup of tea but I started
[12:10.200 --> 12:15.040]  to really last night look at videos of this and look at photos of her in the
[12:15.040 --> 12:21.680]  official White House photo and she looks like an NBA center I mean she looks
[12:21.680 --> 12:27.280]  more like Shaquille O'Neal than a black woman and knowing all the weirdness and
[12:27.280 --> 12:30.520]  that we don't even know who Obama really is and his social security numbers
[12:30.520 --> 12:38.680]  don't he verify and then his dad clearly we sell the documentary dreams of my
[12:38.680 --> 12:45.280]  real father and I mean it's him with the famous pornographer who lived in
[12:45.280 --> 12:49.120]  Hawaii whose grandfather's was best buddies with and who Obama would stay
[12:49.120 --> 12:53.520]  the summers with a famous communist pornographer and you look at the guy
[12:53.520 --> 12:59.320]  it's Obama's dad so the whole Kenya thing with her saying my husband's from
[12:59.320 --> 13:05.280]  Kenya we visited his place of birth in multiple videos in 2006 and 7 his Harvard
[13:05.280 --> 13:09.760]  review where he was the head of the Harvard Law Review and he said I was
[13:09.760 --> 13:15.200]  born in Kenya in his bio and in his bio for shopping book deals when he was a
[13:15.200 --> 13:20.240]  senator state senator said I was born in Kenya and we and we took that bait
[13:20.240 --> 13:23.720]  hook line and sinker folks they don't my god they're covering up the records
[13:23.720 --> 13:26.480]  always from Kenya but his dad looks something like him and then you see
[13:26.480 --> 13:32.120]  Frank Marshall Davis I mean it's his daddy and then his grandfather's best
[13:32.120 --> 13:38.440]  buddies with him in the CIA and you go oh my gosh and then imagine the joke see
[13:38.440 --> 13:43.080]  it's all about a joke on us that he's got cut out daughters look nothing like
[13:43.080 --> 13:47.080]  him and a cut out wife and I'm again to look at his daughters last night and
[13:47.080 --> 13:54.160]  look at his wife she's either she's has that double
[13:54.160 --> 13:58.760]  chromosodal disorder where women are really men and it's turned out a lot of
[13:58.760 --> 14:05.800]  the Olympic runners and a lot of the top tennis players and and things really
[14:05.800 --> 14:12.040]  are not even really females they have the they're not a mafrodite some of them
[14:12.040 --> 14:16.800]  are a mafrodite or both a lot of them have this double chromosome men could
[14:16.800 --> 14:20.920]  have it too and the Olympics are looking at trying to ban this in men and
[14:20.920 --> 14:25.800]  women because men are like super men they're like cavemen and then the women
[14:25.800 --> 14:31.560]  are like men when they have this chromosodal disorder was the double x
[14:31.560 --> 14:35.520]  double y perfect for me some literature on that I'm going from memory but I'll
[14:35.520 --> 14:43.080]  always look at her her jaw her shoulders her pelvis all of it looks male and she
[14:43.080 --> 14:50.000]  has that male Superman physique and it just clicked I you know what I bet she
[14:50.000 --> 14:56.560]  is not who she says she is I mean my gut just just really registered with that
[14:56.560 --> 15:02.040]  what do you think about that there is chromosome abnormality chromosome
[15:02.040 --> 15:06.720]  anomaly abnormality aberration or mutation is a missing extra or a
[15:06.720 --> 15:11.680]  regular portion of chromosomal DNA they can be from a atypical number of
[15:11.680 --> 15:16.840]  chromosomes or a structural abnormality in one of the chromosomes chromosome
[15:16.840 --> 15:20.440]  mutation has formally used in a strict sense to mean a change in a
[15:20.440 --> 15:25.800]  chromosomal segment involving more than one gene yeah but find the one guys
[15:25.800 --> 15:31.880]  that's hyper male or hyper female it's super male super female there's a number
[15:31.880 --> 15:34.840]  seeing documentaries about it and reading books about it in biology reading
[15:34.840 --> 15:40.400]  about it but it's a big issue in the Olympics they talk about on ESPN where
[15:40.400 --> 15:44.920]  they go and they do blood test on you know female runners and folks that don't
[15:44.920 --> 15:49.760]  look like women and hey it turns out they don't have a penis excuse my French
[15:49.760 --> 15:56.600]  but that's the word that's the medical word for it but they do have male male
[15:56.600 --> 16:01.960]  genetics they're men they're men and it turned out remember the Russians couldn't
[16:01.960 --> 16:05.960]  lose in the 60s and 70s and 80s and the women weightlifting didn't really look
[16:05.960 --> 16:10.200]  like women and they would test them and and they didn't have steroids in them
[16:10.200 --> 16:14.840]  but they look like men well they were men
[16:20.120 --> 16:24.040]  now continuing here ladies and gentlemen let's open the phones up about that I
[16:24.040 --> 16:28.160]  mean they lie about everything else they said there were no death panels in
[16:28.160 --> 16:31.760]  Obamacare and now they admit yes they're death panels and yes we have them for
[16:31.760 --> 16:34.680]  the veterans we have them on list where they don't get treatment we just let them
[16:34.680 --> 16:38.720]  die and then we take the workers from there and use them to take care of the
[16:38.720 --> 16:46.120]  illegal aliens and Obama's lie about everything else I mean what is true how
[16:46.120 --> 16:55.320]  do you pronounce that the Kline Felter syndrome the xxy the syndrome is a set
[16:55.320 --> 16:59.960]  of symptoms resulting from an additional x genetic material in males also known
[16:59.960 --> 17:06.240]  as 47 xxy or xxy the syndrome is the genetic disorder in which there is at
[17:06.240 --> 17:13.280]  least one extra x chromosome to a strand of human male genetics for a total of
[17:13.280 --> 17:19.840]  47 yeah that's the one in males control f female I want the one on female the
[17:19.840 --> 17:23.520]  point is we're gonna be investigating this and looking into it because she
[17:23.520 --> 17:28.680]  looks like the women I've seen before on television that have this so it may just
[17:28.680 --> 17:32.560]  be that she has a genetic disorder and that's why her shoulders are wider than
[17:32.560 --> 17:37.800]  mine I have extremely wide shoulders I have a huge head but still you could put
[17:37.800 --> 17:43.440]  two of my heads on my shoulders you could put three heads the average male is
[17:43.440 --> 17:47.920]  supposed to be able to have three heads across their shoulders a female supposed
[17:47.920 --> 17:51.680]  to have two heads or one head in the middle and you could put a half head on
[17:51.680 --> 17:56.560]  each side and you look at Michelle Obama and straight on photos they're very rare
[17:56.560 --> 18:00.640]  in fact when you have seen her on television and when the camera turns
[18:00.640 --> 18:06.040]  on she'll stand turning to the side she wears fluffy deals around her waist but
[18:06.040 --> 18:11.440]  when she's not wearing that when you see her in a bathing suit man it looks like
[18:11.440 --> 18:20.560]  a man and there are the photos of she's either keeping a banana in her pants I
[18:20.560 --> 18:27.040]  mean I'm sorry ladies and gentlemen or or she's a man and I mean I'm sorry we
[18:27.040 --> 18:30.320]  just have to talk about this and I heard this eight years ago that he's
[18:30.320 --> 18:35.720]  married to a transvestite and and now Joan Rivers has said it and she says oh
[18:35.720 --> 18:40.040]  it's a compliment you know because you know being a male or female who's had
[18:40.040 --> 18:44.240]  a row that's bad basically you need to be something else I look I'm not attacking
[18:44.240 --> 18:48.320]  anybody there's certainly this is just being pushed and then Obama admits that
[18:48.320 --> 18:51.720]  he was raised in Indonesia by a transvestite nanny so there's and his
[18:51.720 --> 18:56.320]  dad's this famous pornographer and just all this I mean regardless he stayed
[18:56.320 --> 19:00.560]  summers with a famous communist publisher and pornographer I mean his
[19:00.560 --> 19:04.320]  grandfather played hung out with him played golf and would quote leave Obama
[19:04.320 --> 19:08.760]  there for the summer I mean if it isn't his dad sure looks like him there it is
[19:08.760 --> 19:12.560]  Joan Rivers storms out of negative scene interviews days after calling Michelle
[19:12.560 --> 19:21.440]  Obama a tranny so again all I'm saying is we need her to publicly give a blood
[19:21.440 --> 19:25.920]  test and they can you only need to drop a blood to do a DNA check and she can
[19:25.920 --> 19:31.320]  send it out to a bunch of private labs and put all this to bed right now and
[19:31.320 --> 19:35.960]  and if and if her identity is a woman I respect that
[19:36.080 --> 19:41.280]  seriously I respect the Wachowski brother becoming a woman I and we respect
[19:41.280 --> 19:46.160]  Michael because you know Obama has called her Michael introducing her
[19:46.160 --> 19:51.120]  repeatedly so I mean if Michael wants to become Michelle or Bradley Manning wants
[19:51.120 --> 19:56.720]  to become candy or what is it what's the name Chelsea Chelsea I respect that I'm

[24:23.720 --> 24:34.080]  again folks I'm joking around a little bit about Michelle Obama but the more
[24:34.080 --> 24:37.240]  appropriate question since Joan Rivers and everybody else keeps raising this
[24:37.240 --> 24:45.280]  about Michael Obama or Michelle Obama or Bradley Manning or Chelsea or whatever
[24:45.280 --> 24:50.840]  their names are is that does she have the Kline-Selters syndrome because she
[24:50.840 --> 24:55.920]  has the hands and the shoulders of a man and now this is a big national news
[24:55.920 --> 25:00.200]  story and I think the reason it's a big national news story is people don't
[25:00.200 --> 25:04.680]  believe a word the government in the system says anymore it's a real loss of
[25:04.680 --> 25:08.960]  confidence and now there's a loss of confidence in the dollar and there's a
[25:08.960 --> 25:13.560]  loss of confidence in institutions and the government's lawless so the fact
[25:13.560 --> 25:17.680]  that people don't believe anything about the official story of Obama is for
[25:17.680 --> 25:23.280]  good reasons because we don't really know who Obama is other than it looks
[25:23.280 --> 25:28.840]  like his dad is a famous communist from Chicago who moved to Hawaii now the
[25:28.840 --> 25:32.880]  Kline-Selters syndrome the question should be does Michelle Obama have
[25:32.880 --> 25:37.040]  Kline-Selters syndrome where they generally choose the sex whether it's
[25:37.040 --> 25:41.720]  gonna be male or female when they're a child and this is a big problem in
[25:41.720 --> 25:47.280]  sports men playing as women and dominating the sports and there's a
[25:47.280 --> 25:52.240]  Hollywood actress that's known for being like this there's a famous tennis
[25:52.240 --> 25:56.960]  player that keeps winning who a lot of the main line pundits say look at her
[25:56.960 --> 26:01.080]  shoulders look at everything else this is really a man and so that's where I'm
[26:01.080 --> 26:08.480]  coming from on that issue here today actually to be more serious we have
[26:08.480 --> 26:13.320]  discovered the true identity of Michelle Obama and it's not that she's a
[26:13.320 --> 26:18.920]  transvestite or transsexual it's that she's actually part of the legion of
[26:18.920 --> 26:26.040]  doom merman that's right ladies and gentlemen if you look up merman it is a
[26:26.040 --> 26:32.680]  spitting image that the wide shoulders the tiny waist the same teeth the same
[26:32.680 --> 26:40.640]  eyes and then the same is that dorsal fins I'm not sure the point is ladies
[26:40.640 --> 26:47.120]  and gentlemen we have it that's gills Alex that's gills Obama is is not really
[26:47.120 --> 26:56.040]  from Kenya or Hawaii he's from Merland and so is Joe Biden while we're at it
[26:56.040 --> 27:00.920]  hey I did not come on air to be involved in the comedy today I've been so busy
[27:00.920 --> 27:04.440]  getting the new TV system ready and a bunch of other family issues and things
[27:04.440 --> 27:08.120]  that I usually get ready couple hours before at home to get here about an
[27:08.120 --> 27:11.040]  hour before 30 minutes for I got here about five minutes for broadcast time
[27:11.040 --> 27:15.800]  today and I have all this incredibly important serious news here in front of
[27:15.800 --> 27:22.880]  me and at this point I believe so little out of what I see in mainstream media
[27:22.880 --> 27:30.000]  that that I don't know what to believe anymore and I think the New York Times
[27:30.000 --> 27:34.000]  should quote me that I'm dead serious that Michelle Obama may actually be a
[27:34.000 --> 27:41.000]  space alien from a water world planet okay I'm being sarcastic but again one
[27:41.000 --> 27:46.080]  time John Ronson wrote in his book them that I believe real werewolves were
[27:46.080 --> 27:49.880]  running around in the forest of northern California because I joked around and
[27:49.880 --> 27:54.000]  said man this is scary there's three-foot of solid fog on the ground with
[27:54.000 --> 27:59.320]  pine trees and I can hear coyotes howling it's like one of those 1950s
[27:59.320 --> 28:03.560]  werewolf movies and so that was translated in his book into the fact that
[28:03.560 --> 28:07.520]  I was running around the dark scared of werewolves so I would actually love to
[28:07.520 --> 28:12.520]  have the New York Times come out and say that I believe she is merman because
[28:12.520 --> 28:16.800]  that would just show how ridiculous they are okay I'm not gonna digress anymore
[28:16.800 --> 28:22.320]  and I apologize and I'm gonna be serious when we come back and get into
[28:22.320 --> 28:30.240]  Russia says it will have radar evading nukes by 2021 and also is there life on
[28:30.240 --> 28:37.520]  Mars water can and does exist on the planet says new research I love how
[28:37.520 --> 28:41.200]  they always have new research shading the obvious Mars has a southern and
[28:41.200 --> 28:47.520]  northern ice cap and they've had probes land on it back in the what was the third
[28:47.520 --> 28:51.280]  Viking was the first and a couple others that had a whole bunch of them I mean
[28:51.280 --> 28:58.320]  they've confirmed waters all over the planet new research out they've
[28:58.320 --> 29:05.040]  discovered the Marianas trench 9,000 feet deep in the Marianas few weeks ago I
[29:05.040 --> 29:11.600]  saw that headline I mean they're always rediscovering everything I've told my
[29:11.600 --> 29:18.880]  reporters I said what's really old is new but what's a week old is ancient so you
[29:18.880 --> 29:21.240]  know we can report on the newest development with the super volcano like

[29:38.920 --> 29:43.480]  primer for the next super wave to come in that could be the crisis that brings

[34:30.600 --> 34:34.360]  get into comedy because this stuff is too heavy for me sometimes I mean it gets
[34:34.360 --> 34:43.080]  to me I don't reality gets to you but I am sick and tired of the so-called left
[34:43.080 --> 34:50.280]  who are really a bunch of authoritarians trying to set the agenda and boss
[34:50.280 --> 34:54.040]  everyone around and once they've gotten you to be dominated by them through
[34:54.040 --> 34:59.720]  political correctness peer pressure mind control cult tactics then they can get
[34:59.720 --> 35:03.920]  you to comply with whatever social norm they want and that is basically
[35:03.920 --> 35:07.400]  splitting your wrist and giving everything you've got to the kleptocratic
[35:07.400 --> 35:13.560]  corrupt system I mean an example of this is I was working out with a buddy
[35:13.560 --> 35:18.600]  this morning we were not being loud and another fellow that has a French bulldog
[35:18.600 --> 35:23.520]  came in that I know and his French bulldog had been chasing balls and
[35:23.520 --> 35:26.320]  jumping off stuff and hurt its neck because if you get an athletic French
[35:26.320 --> 35:30.160]  bulldog most of them aren't athletic but his dogs athletic and my dogs athletic
[35:30.160 --> 35:34.400]  they'll jump off fences they'll jump over things they'll run into walls they
[35:34.400 --> 35:40.800]  have huge heads and he was about ten feet away going hey you know my dogs
[35:40.800 --> 35:43.920]  better how's your dog and I was saying yeah he's doing a lot better he's pretty
[35:43.920 --> 35:48.200]  much a hundred percent back from from blowing one of his discount and I was
[35:48.200 --> 35:52.320]  talking about this loud oh hey yeah Tom oh good your dog's doing better Ziggy's
[35:52.320 --> 35:56.480]  doing better yeah captain's doing better he's pretty much a hundred percent oh
[35:56.480 --> 36:00.240]  yeah I've got to stay with my parents sometimes when I go out of town but yeah
[36:00.240 --> 36:04.040]  yeah he's on oh really you know your parents are keeping your dog for a
[36:04.040 --> 36:08.360]  couple weeks to go out of town too and this woman walks right over and goes be
[36:08.360 --> 36:14.600]  quiet and I said this is a gym not a library but I said I'm not even yelling
[36:14.600 --> 36:19.800]  I'm talking ten feet away to that guy in this voice right now but well the first
[36:19.800 --> 36:23.640]  I said okay I said and she was staring she was bugging her eyes out at me and I
[36:23.640 --> 36:29.840]  said are you serious he said yeah I'm serious be quiet and I was sitting there
[36:29.840 --> 36:34.440]  and I said well I'm not being that loud this isn't a library I said what's your
[36:34.440 --> 36:39.000]  name and she wouldn't give me your name and I smiled at her and then she said
[36:39.000 --> 36:43.840]  her name and I said mine and I smiled at her again and then she just gave me
[36:43.840 --> 36:50.400]  dirty looks for the next hour and would like walk in my space and one of my
[36:50.400 --> 36:53.400]  buddies was like man I think she's trying to pick you up or something I was
[36:53.400 --> 36:57.440]  like no she's not I talked to somebody else at the gym that says she does that
[36:57.440 --> 37:04.600]  to other men and she wants you to shut up she wants to dominate you and it's
[37:04.600 --> 37:09.280]  this basic assertiveness training that they're giving women now and of course
[37:09.280 --> 37:13.320]  if they asserted themselves in business being charming and going and playing
[37:13.320 --> 37:20.520]  golf with men and you know not making up sexual harassment on everybody and not
[37:20.520 --> 37:25.200]  you know you know playing games they would be successful and that's the real
[37:25.200 --> 37:29.120]  reason women on average are not paid as much as men they've got insurance
[37:29.120 --> 37:33.840]  actuaries out on it now that they tend to leave from maternity leave they tend
[37:33.840 --> 37:38.560]  to want to take off and they have family problems and that's fine I totally get
[37:38.560 --> 37:42.240]  it understand on average and there are a lot of great women better than men in
[37:42.240 --> 37:48.400]  business I'm just saying as a stereotype as an average this is something
[37:48.400 --> 37:53.760]  you're seeing more and more and more and I pick up women's magazines and it's
[37:53.760 --> 37:58.640]  like divorce your husband it's so much fun your life will be great and I was
[37:58.640 --> 38:03.000]  reading a statistic where the vast majority of divorces are now women and
[38:03.000 --> 38:07.440]  their girlfriends tell them go get a divorce it's like getting a new you
[38:07.440 --> 38:11.720]  know winter coat or something it's like getting a new car it's so great get rid
[38:11.720 --> 38:17.800]  of him you don't need him and then women aren't fulfilled under the system men
[38:17.800 --> 38:23.720]  aren't either and they're so incredibly angry on average and then Michelle
[38:23.720 --> 38:29.840]  Obama's on TV saying don't use the word bossy it refers to women it's like
[38:29.840 --> 38:36.680]  saying brown bags put down brown people so if I drove a brown car nothing to do
[38:36.680 --> 38:44.000]  with it you see everybody's so hyper sensitive and literally mentally ill to
[38:44.000 --> 38:47.280]  the point of where we just say look we'll do whatever you say just don't call
[38:47.280 --> 38:52.840]  us racist homophobic or sexist and I'll be honest I wasn't brought up to be
[38:52.840 --> 38:57.840]  racist I wasn't brought up to be against gay people I wasn't brought up to be
[38:57.840 --> 39:06.920]  against anybody but when the BBC has the headline bossy should we ban it and
[39:06.920 --> 39:14.760]  Michelle Obama chimes in and says yes I mean this is pure authoritarianism and
[39:14.760 --> 39:20.840]  authoritarianism can come in the form of a white male it can come in the form of a
[39:20.840 --> 39:25.680]  black female it come in the form of a Hispanic female or male but it just so
[39:25.680 --> 39:31.200]  happens in the socialist paradigm model and you can look at this in the Soviet
[39:31.200 --> 39:38.120]  Union you can look at this in in in current systems they choose women to be
[39:38.120 --> 39:43.680]  the mate of the state and that's why they say look if you're a woman with kids
[39:43.680 --> 39:48.760]  anywhere in the world you want to come here you can get here unless it's from a
[39:48.760 --> 39:53.520]  Western nation if you're from Australia Scotland Germany Switzerland it's on
[39:53.520 --> 39:58.920]  record it's in the news that they will not let you move here because they they
[39:58.920 --> 40:04.440]  don't want high skilled people it's hard to move here if you're from Japan they
[40:04.440 --> 40:08.240]  don't want high skilled people who have a history of thinking to have some rights
[40:08.240 --> 40:14.880]  they want women who will immediately plug into the state immediately trust the
[40:14.880 --> 40:20.400]  state and I want to tell Hispanic something and this is really almost an
[40:20.400 --> 40:28.720]  oxymoron because Hispanics are on average a mix between Spaniards Portuguese
[40:28.720 --> 40:36.080]  and Native Americans of Central South America and North America you know just
[40:36.080 --> 40:39.840]  like I mean you could claim I was Hispanic by that yardstick because I
[40:39.840 --> 40:46.640]  have so many Native American bloodlines from having ancestors from you know the
[40:46.640 --> 40:49.640]  early days of this country almost everybody ended up intermarrying with
[40:49.640 --> 40:53.320]  Native Americans at one point and it's just basically everybody in my family
[40:53.320 --> 41:01.160]  especially in my dad's side has Cherokee Comanche you name it
[41:01.160 --> 41:10.400]  seminal red stick I mean I guess I'm really Hispanic I mean if you wanted to
[41:10.400 --> 41:16.040]  because if that's what Hispanic is is a European with a native and that's what
[41:16.040 --> 41:21.840]  Spanish Spaniards are I mean Spaniards a thousand years ago in the paintings and
[41:21.840 --> 41:25.240]  the drawings were blonde-haired blue eyes they're basically Germans and then
[41:25.240 --> 41:29.360]  that the North African Arabs invaded so in southern Spain you get some of that
[41:29.360 --> 41:33.400]  pretty black hair and you know that exotic look and all the rest of it but
[41:33.400 --> 41:36.880]  but I mean so I guess you can claim those people are Hispanic if you want to
[41:36.880 --> 41:42.240]  say any European mixed with anybody who's Asian that's what an Arab is is a
[41:42.240 --> 41:47.600]  European mixed with an Asian mixed with some African I mean this is just a fact
[41:47.600 --> 41:54.960]  the the the Arabs on average are about half Asian they're basically Chinese and
[41:54.960 --> 42:01.320]  the genetics of a Mesoamerican a pure Mayan is a Chinese person I mean you
[42:01.320 --> 42:08.160]  can look this up in genetics it's even in you know mainline publications so
[42:08.160 --> 42:13.360]  that's why they even get the Mongolian spots a Hispanic baby if they're more
[42:13.360 --> 42:16.440]  native will have big purple spots down their back and you they get their kids
[42:16.440 --> 42:20.720]  taken by CPS all the time you know my sister's adopted Korean and you know
[42:20.720 --> 42:24.400]  until she was about to she had big purple spots down her back and that's an
[42:24.400 --> 42:29.360]  Asian trait she's South Korean and you know my parents routinely had to get
[42:29.360 --> 42:33.680]  called into swim team or she still does about four actually or was it I forget
[42:33.680 --> 42:36.680]  the point was I remember some of the daycare when they put her in their part
[42:36.680 --> 42:39.960]  time or whatever I remember they had issues with it explaining no these are
[42:39.960 --> 42:45.920]  Mongolian spots and then that was racist because we'd adopted a Asian but to then
[42:45.920 --> 42:50.480]  say there's a something called a spot information is racist you have to
[42:50.480 --> 42:55.760]  understand yet to understand that in fact ignorance is what political
[42:55.760 --> 43:00.080]  correctness is ladies and gentlemen I don't know how I went off on that long
[43:00.080 --> 43:04.280]  jag but I wanted to explain something to you Hispanics if you like what's been
[43:04.280 --> 43:09.160]  done to the black community going from lower illegitimacy than the white
[43:09.160 --> 43:13.480]  community in the 40s to the highest ever known over 90 percent if you like the
[43:13.480 --> 43:18.560]  highest prison population for a group ever known if you like the lowest test
[43:18.560 --> 43:23.800]  scores ever known in this country if you like the most poverty the highest
[43:23.800 --> 43:28.640]  murder rate and basically total societal collapse like we've seen in the black
[43:28.640 --> 43:33.240]  community that the globalist literally on record the Democratic Party
[43:33.240 --> 43:36.720]  engineered in by getting the women and saying kicked the men out of the house
[43:36.720 --> 43:42.040]  and then you're gonna get a full welfare ride that's what's being offered out of
[43:42.040 --> 43:48.320]  the hand of Obama and Robert Rodriguez here in Austin Texas tonight and then
[43:48.320 --> 43:54.440]  Robert Rodriguez and Barack Obama will sit and perch or the Democratic Party
[43:54.440 --> 43:58.320]  the Republicans just want to bankrupt everything and have cheap labor and
[43:58.320 --> 44:01.680]  bring down the country as well and they're all the same elite but but the
[44:01.680 --> 44:06.560]  Democrats run the local law firms that legalize all the illegals and run all
[44:06.560 --> 44:11.120]  the scams and suck the money out of them publicly they they run all this okay
[44:11.120 --> 44:17.160]  and so if you want to look like what's been done to the inner city black
[44:17.160 --> 44:21.360]  communities believe me you're gonna really like what Big Brother does to you
[44:21.360 --> 44:26.200]  so the hand you're being offered lovingly just and it's the same thing of
[44:26.200 --> 44:32.280]  all poor people you take some poor East Texas person on welfare and you take
[44:32.280 --> 44:38.280]  some poor East Texas Hispanic on welfare and some poor black from East
[44:38.280 --> 44:44.040]  Texas on welfare and actually I got family and East Texas I go to I mean I
[44:44.040 --> 44:46.960]  actually they're all together now we'll talk about equality they're all
[44:46.960 --> 44:51.760]  together now it'll be a bunch of 300 pound blacks whites and Hispanics or
[44:51.760 --> 44:56.480]  maybe 400 pound sitting around with their kids that all have disorders and
[44:56.480 --> 45:00.680]  take all the shots sitting around a table getting ready to have their legs
[45:00.680 --> 45:04.560]  chopped off from diabetes what they already have I mean you go in these
[45:04.560 --> 45:08.680]  cafes and places and they're all sitting around talking about what they saw on
[45:08.680 --> 45:16.240]  television and how they're waiting on insurance money and they're wrecked and
[45:16.240 --> 45:21.320]  they're all basically been destroyed by the system and that's gonna go system
[45:21.320 --> 45:28.160]  wide by design that's what this is the full bankrupting of this country up one
[45:28.160 --> 45:34.520]  side and down the other and that's where this whole civilization is going
[45:34.520 --> 45:43.280]  because we have to be dehumanized and destroyed before we can be brought in
[45:43.280 --> 45:47.480]  to the eugenics model for full social engineering and finally the organized
[45:47.480 --> 45:53.680]  population reduction down to they tell top professors in publications 100
[45:53.680 --> 45:56.720]  million will be kept alive so that they think they'll be part of it with their
[45:56.720 --> 46:01.960]  families but higher level like dr. Pianca at UT admits no they're gonna go
[46:01.960 --> 46:06.800]  ahead and go down to 1 million and then those are gonna merge with machines now
[46:06.800 --> 46:11.480]  I'm not saying all that's gonna happen that's what Ray Kurzweil dr. Pianca
[46:11.480 --> 46:16.720]  Bill Joy and the entire ruling technocracy in their own words say
[46:16.720 --> 46:22.080]  they're doing and I'm here debating I'm not racist because I don't want totally
[46:22.080 --> 46:26.160]  open borders with mothers with three or four kids directly being put on
[46:26.160 --> 46:30.680]  welfare as our cities counties and states go bankrupt I have to sit here on
[46:30.680 --> 46:37.080]  the defense because the moral authority is the Democrats saying don't say bossy
[46:37.080 --> 46:42.000]  don't say you built your business don't say immigrant see first it's don't say
[46:42.000 --> 46:46.400]  illegal immigrant now it's don't say immigrant that's racist now you need to
[46:46.400 --> 46:51.080]  say migrant migrants go back these people don't go back migrants go back
[46:51.080 --> 46:56.120]  these aren't migrants and then now that's not enough it's unaccompanied
[46:56.120 --> 47:02.600]  children and then we've learned okay whatever you say the new reality is you
[47:02.600 --> 47:06.240]  tell us the new reality every day the new words were supposed to use and will
[47:06.240 --> 47:11.160]  be correct and then I look at all these cowardly weak people you know I talk to
[47:11.160 --> 47:14.640]  liberals all the time we'll come up and insult me or say something on the street
[47:14.640 --> 47:19.360]  and I'll say hey come here sit down have dinner let me buy you dinner I've done
[47:19.360 --> 47:22.880]  this as a sociological test I've done it in front of people at work in this
[47:22.880 --> 47:26.920]  office how to do it with hidden cameras sometime didn't happen very often though
[47:26.920 --> 47:30.600]  but when it does I'll say come here you just came over bumped into me and said
[47:30.600 --> 47:34.440]  you want to kick my ass and you know you obviously know who I am and everything
[47:34.440 --> 47:37.280]  you're showing off you're over there at the bar with those people I'm here eating
[47:37.280 --> 47:42.440]  sushi I'm gonna buy you a drink and they're like no no I'm gonna buy you one
[47:42.440 --> 47:46.760]  so then the no no I don't want to drink just come on over here and I go listen
[47:46.760 --> 47:52.280]  you do all this political correctness and all this to feel good and and to feel
[47:52.280 --> 47:55.080]  like you're being successful right I mean you really know it's a bunch of bull
[47:55.080 --> 48:02.040]  to to say you know that if you don't like Obama carry your racist and buy a
[48:02.040 --> 48:05.840]  10-minute talk they go look I know it's all total bull you're right I just play
[48:05.840 --> 48:10.480]  along with it go along with it and I don't know why I sent that to you and I
[48:10.480 --> 48:15.600]  don't know why I try to start a fight with you and and the good thing is more
[48:15.600 --> 48:18.640]  and more I've learned because this doesn't happen very often but it's
[48:18.640 --> 48:22.360]  happened a lot over the years to not blow up at people and then I have them
[48:22.360 --> 48:27.600]  literally awake eating out of my hand when I'm smooth when I give it to them
[48:27.600 --> 48:32.960]  easy and so maybe there is something towards you know being more calm with
[48:32.960 --> 48:36.760]  these people because really they're just really scared they have no intellectual
[48:36.760 --> 48:44.520]  backbone they have no rudder and you know daddy left when they were 5 and all
[48:44.520 --> 48:50.600]  they know is posing and they just want to show off to their friends because
[48:50.600 --> 48:55.360]  they're just threatened by celebrity there's a real phenomenon now of when
[48:55.360 --> 48:58.680]  Nicholas Cage was in town people coming up being mean to him or making fun of him
[48:58.680 --> 49:01.600]  or saying nothing to him when he was here promoting his movie Joe that's
[49:01.600 --> 49:06.440]  excellent by the way absolute East Texas they shot it with real East Texas
[49:06.440 --> 49:10.280]  people East Texas trash most of the people were not actors in the movie
[49:10.280 --> 49:14.720]  that's the whole new thing in movies is to not use actors the movie under the
[49:14.720 --> 49:21.400]  skin was real men being abducted by Scarlett Johansson and really walking
[49:21.400 --> 49:26.280]  into black water that is to have sex with her
[49:26.280 --> 49:31.960]  I mean wow that's cinema right there let me tell you but I mean I talked a lot of
[49:31.960 --> 49:35.200]  celebrities and other people all over the place people throw drinks on them
[49:35.200 --> 49:37.720]  they'll attack them they'll do whatever because now it's not even about
[49:37.720 --> 49:42.160]  worshiping the celebrity it's about you're so angry they're a celebrity and
[49:42.160 --> 49:46.480]  you feel so inadequate because television is the only real world to you and it
[49:46.480 --> 49:51.000]  hasn't delivered for you the fantasy world you live in watching TV all day
[49:51.000 --> 49:58.480]  that you then attack anyone from the system and I think that's actually
[49:58.480 --> 50:02.840]  healthy as a beginning because you're at least now rejecting it realizing it
[50:02.840 --> 50:07.120]  won't fulfill you if that's all you care about you like art you like films
[50:07.120 --> 50:11.120]  that's fine but it's not it's not the whole world why are you crying and
[50:11.120 --> 50:15.080]  acting like you know I heard there were some suicides in Brazil whenever Brazil
[50:15.080 --> 50:23.120]  lost to Germany 7 to 1 and I just find it fascinating how if these people
[50:23.120 --> 50:26.840]  cared about their freedom as much as they cared about a sports team they would
[50:26.840 --> 50:30.920]  be free but they don't so they're slaves and that's why they view sports for
[50:30.920 --> 50:34.560]  thousands of years as social control when they found out the Olympics in
[50:34.560 --> 50:39.920]  France you know the latest Olympics not the one in Greece the turn of the last
[50:39.920 --> 50:44.520]  century with French royalty setting it up with the Germans they said we'll use
[50:44.520 --> 50:48.400]  it as social control look it up I mean what I'm telling you is not my opinion
[50:48.400 --> 50:52.320]  I mean that's what you have to understand all right I'm gonna come back with
[50:52.320 --> 50:57.640]  ISIS you know NATO secret al-Qaeda army blowing up ancient Babylonian and
[50:57.640 --> 51:02.440]  Christian shrines gentlemen in search of a million-dollar smile that'll make

[52:00.040 --> 52:03.880]  important information I want to tell you about Matt Red Hawk and his team of
[52:03.880 --> 52:08.080]  Patriots over at my Patriots supply several years ago Matt was sitting in
[52:08.080 --> 52:11.120]  his two bedroom apartment frustrated with the direction this country was

[53:53.040 --> 54:16.880]  that's 888 507 8 7 8 9 by the way the Republican leadership wants open
[54:16.880 --> 54:22.120]  borders and they want to be able to vulcanize the country and again that's
[54:22.120 --> 54:26.200]  why I'm so against these open borders is this being done and managed by
[54:26.200 --> 54:31.600]  globalist to break up the country and to create divide and conquer glenn beck
[54:31.600 --> 54:35.680]  obviously wanting attention they said he's to bring soccer balls hot meals to
[54:35.680 --> 54:40.320]  illegals we must open our hearts believes America must open our hearts to the
[54:40.320 --> 54:48.320]  illegal immigrant children glenn beck again is basically will travel to
[54:48.320 --> 54:52.960]  mcallon for a big stunt because he believes americans must open our hearts
[54:52.960 --> 54:57.160]  so there's not going to be any discussion of how the government is
[54:57.160 --> 55:01.640]  bringing them in on purpose or how it's totally illegal or how this will only
[55:01.640 --> 55:06.760]  encourage massive waves so glenn you can give the 10 million that are going to
[55:06.760 --> 55:11.120]  come soccer balls to a perfect gimmick those see this is the difference between
[55:11.120 --> 55:16.640]  having an advertisement show that's that that's that's just about illusion versus
[55:16.640 --> 55:20.720]  reality because the truth is we could take unlimited people from the third
[55:20.720 --> 55:24.480]  world we could take a hundred million it's not gonna help the third world we
[55:24.480 --> 55:27.720]  need to get freedom in those countries and get them out from under despotic
[55:27.720 --> 55:33.200]  regimes but instead we're going under despotism and so prosperity is going
[55:33.200 --> 55:39.160]  out the window and John Boehner says there will be no impeaching Obama as if
[55:39.160 --> 55:44.840]  he controls the House of Representatives now my issue is I get letting Obama
[55:44.840 --> 55:49.960]  continue to destroy the authoritarian liberals in the in the eyes of the
[55:49.960 --> 55:56.320]  people I get that but there may not be a country left in two years ladies and
[55:56.320 --> 55:59.720]  gentlemen and I don't trust the republicans even though they get a bunch
[55:59.720 --> 56:03.040]  of tea party people elected to reverse this because the same special interest
[56:03.040 --> 56:07.560]  that won open borders for cheap labor and to balkanize the country are the
[56:07.560 --> 56:13.800]  ones running John Boehner who's always hanging out with Obama so my gut tells
[56:13.800 --> 56:17.480]  me justice be done may the heavens fall I don't mean to plagiarize that I forget
[56:17.480 --> 56:22.200]  who said it I believe was a founding father but that means you do the right
[56:22.200 --> 56:28.000]  thing no matter what because soon enough playing games compromising you get in the
[56:28.000 --> 56:32.120]  position we're in now I believe you bring out an impeachment you bring out
[56:32.120 --> 56:37.280]  all the real crimes fast and furious Salindra Benghazi all of it we could
[56:37.280 --> 56:42.840]  really have him step down and that would discredit their party even more and
[56:42.840 --> 56:47.160]  scare the republicans not to violate the Miller rights and Constitution scare
[56:47.160 --> 56:51.800]  this corrupt political class to back off because let me tell you this country
[56:51.800 --> 56:58.280]  has cancer I mean it's out of control both parties are a plague the Democrats
[56:58.280 --> 57:02.800]  though are going for total takeover broke trying to extinct the republican
[57:02.800 --> 57:06.720]  party and this current crop of republicans to get paid off and to get
[57:06.720 --> 57:12.760]  corporate board chairmanship are going along with it the fix is in and so I'm
[57:12.760 --> 57:16.480]  going to put out an article or a video I'm gonna write a bunch of points and do
[57:16.480 --> 57:19.800]  it again like I did a few years ago with my declaration of independence the
[57:19.800 --> 57:22.680]  drudge and others picked up that a lot of lawyers looked at and she was
[57:22.680 --> 57:26.800]  excellent my bragging I mean I just go off common sense I'm gonna come up with
[57:26.800 --> 57:31.400]  a declaration of survival an emergency declaration of independence a
[57:31.400 --> 57:37.360]  declaration for survival and just point out what's happened again and I'm gonna
[57:37.360 --> 57:42.400]  put in some extra hours getting this written and done and I don't know put
[57:42.400 --> 57:51.520]  out sometime next week but we're in deep trouble and gimmicks aren't gonna
[57:51.520 --> 57:59.360]  save us and you know I agree as a PR win you should see congressman down there
[57:59.360 --> 58:03.360]  giving teddy bears the kids and talking about how terrible it is and saying why
[58:03.360 --> 58:06.960]  did you come here oh well Obama you know it gives awards to the dream kids and
[58:06.960 --> 58:10.960]  we've been told will be legalized which 99% according to the new memo that came
[58:10.960 --> 58:15.880]  out from ice are being legalized yet they're all being legalized folks they
[58:15.880 --> 58:26.520]  do a few token deportations for the television cameras and again the

[58:59.560 --> 59:03.200]  shown to have two to five times higher concentrations of pollutants than even
[59:03.200 --> 59:07.720]  outdoor air and most Americans spend 90% of their time inside using toxic
[59:07.720 --> 59:11.480]  chemicals within their homes there are more than 42 million smokers in the

[59:15.320 --> 59:19.000]  numerous conditions and don't forget the fact that six million Americans live
[59:19.000 --> 59:22.120]  with pets they're allergic to as well when I began to research these
[59:22.120 --> 59:26.720]  statistics it was clear to me it was time to start cleansing my lungs in order
[59:26.720 --> 59:30.440]  to combat the toxic environment that we cannot escape but that we can fight back

[01:00:27.920 --> 01:00:33.960]  video of it documenting it patriots outnumber amnesty supporters 20 to 1
[01:00:33.960 --> 01:00:38.800]  Americans of the Southwest are not supportive of illegal immigration and
[01:00:38.800 --> 01:00:43.760]  folks I see these desperate people from Central and South America that that
[01:00:43.760 --> 01:00:48.560]  Mexico won't allow they have a fence between the fence and so when people
[01:00:48.560 --> 01:00:52.960]  get deported out of the US from Central America the Mexicans just leave them in
[01:00:52.960 --> 01:00:58.920]  a literal no man's land there's a great vice video from a few years ago
[01:00:58.920 --> 01:01:05.160]  documenting that and I feel sorry for him but I didn't do to them what's
[01:01:05.160 --> 01:01:11.240]  happening in Latin America and having them come here to be zombie voters for
[01:01:11.240 --> 01:01:18.240]  the Democrats who are hell bent on destroying male role models because
[01:01:18.240 --> 01:01:25.360]  when you attack a civilization you take down the male first and that's what the
[01:01:25.360 --> 01:01:29.000]  commenters says here in this article that just went up it's got like 200
[01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:33.720]  comments in 10 minutes it's all about capturing the female breeder for the
[01:01:33.720 --> 01:01:38.280]  globalist and ditching the welfare system for human capital energy based
[01:01:38.280 --> 01:01:43.200]  economy the globalist want women's submissive and brainwashed to work to
[01:01:43.200 --> 01:01:47.960]  pay the bills the left is betraying women of all races the next commenter
[01:01:47.960 --> 01:01:51.080]  says the left-right paradigm is a false flag right airing a distraction a
[01:01:51.080 --> 01:01:56.120]  puppet show try to keep it up try to keep up you know I use the term left
[01:01:56.120 --> 01:02:00.360]  right to communicate with new listeners it is a false paradigm but you have to
[01:02:00.360 --> 01:02:05.240]  communicate with people it's like whenever we talk about micro fm's you
[01:02:05.240 --> 01:02:08.760]  know private unlicensed stations that run this show around the country I always
[01:02:08.760 --> 01:02:12.640]  say we there are pirate radio stations out there that carry the show their real
[01:02:12.640 --> 01:02:16.680]  name is micro fm and as long as you're interfering with commercial stations
[01:02:16.680 --> 01:02:21.600]  they're a key you know public service and I salute them and I'll get emails
[01:02:21.600 --> 01:02:30.040]  saying it's called micro or people's radio not pirate I know that I'm the guy
[01:02:30.040 --> 01:02:34.640]  that coined the term left-right paradigm eighteen years ago on record I'm not
[01:02:34.640 --> 01:02:42.680]  bragging it's just it's it it's just fact it's kind of cool to come full
[01:02:42.680 --> 01:02:47.520]  circle because I'm not into power trips or ego I come off as ego testable because
[01:02:47.520 --> 01:02:51.840]  I'm just a rampaging maniac at times I've done this so long I'm so burnt out
[01:02:51.840 --> 01:02:56.080]  I'm beyond even caring about what happens to me I'm just being honest with you in
[01:02:56.080 --> 01:03:00.880]  the final equation it comes off as arrogant but what I do enjoy is the
[01:03:00.880 --> 01:03:07.200]  weirdness of being criticized for not covering 9-11 truth enough when I
[01:03:07.200 --> 01:03:12.080]  started the 9-11 truth movement and I really like people when they criticize
[01:03:12.080 --> 01:03:17.920]  me for being part of the left-right paradigm because it shows that I have
[01:03:17.920 --> 01:03:24.160]  succeeded wildly when people don't even know all over the place left-right
[01:03:24.160 --> 01:03:28.440]  paradigm is used all over the news everywhere product placement which I
[01:03:28.440 --> 01:03:34.880]  then coined propaganda placement is now used everywhere and behavior placement
[01:03:36.640 --> 01:03:42.400]  and again it's a testament to the power of the people
[01:03:44.240 --> 01:03:49.320]  Democrats are saying that Obama's acting bizarre aloof strange but he still
[01:03:49.320 --> 01:03:52.800]  enjoys hanging out with Boehner his good buddy we're gonna cover all the drugs
[01:03:52.800 --> 01:03:58.000]  report.com headlines and info wars.com headlines when we come back and I'm
[01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:03.960]  gonna open the phones up when we come back first we're gonna talk to our
[01:04:03.960 --> 01:04:08.520]  reporters on the ground Joe Biggs and Jakari Jackson and then we're gonna just

[01:04:21.960 --> 01:04:27.280]  the immigration wave news and the really serious news that you should all be
[01:04:27.280 --> 01:04:32.360]  getting chills up and down your back over and grinding your teeth over like I do
[01:04:32.360 --> 01:04:39.240]  autonomous Mercedes Benz semi-debutes on the autobond
[01:04:41.320 --> 01:04:45.320]  you know I have this image like a start of a science fiction movie about you
[01:04:45.320 --> 01:04:49.160]  know first was the computer then the autonomous car then the autonomous robot
[01:04:49.160 --> 01:04:54.560]  then judgment day. We'll be right back ladies and gentlemen I mean the
[01:04:54.560 --> 01:04:57.920]  globalists have already decided we're all dead and we're arguing about black
[01:04:57.920 --> 01:05:03.040]  versus white. I can taste dirt in it. God knows what's in there. These people just
[01:05:03.040 --> 01:05:07.160]  sampled city of Austin tap water straight from the faucet. Next we had
[01:05:07.160 --> 01:05:12.320]  them try a sample of tap water filtered with a propure G2.0 filtration system.
[01:05:12.320 --> 01:05:16.400]  That one is better. Tastes like nothing. Yep. I know a good water tastes like it's
[01:05:16.400 --> 01:05:21.800]  good water. Most tap water contains added substances like fluoride, chlorine, glyphosate
[01:05:21.800 --> 01:05:25.480]  and many others. Studies prove that these substances are linked to an
[01:05:25.480 --> 01:05:29.280]  assortment of major health issues including tooth decay, lower IQ and
[01:05:29.280 --> 01:05:32.720]  even cancer. It tastes like you're drinking out of the lake when you're drinking tap water.
[01:05:32.720 --> 01:05:38.480]  The propure G2.0 filtration system removes these deadly substances leaving
[01:05:38.480 --> 01:05:43.160]  only fresh tasting deliciously clean water. Okay this is very tasty. It's good water.

[01:08:19.840 --> 01:08:26.760]  Obama is traveling all over the United States collecting campaign money for
[01:08:26.760 --> 01:08:32.360]  the Democrats instead of going down the border that he has ordered opened or he
[01:08:32.360 --> 01:08:35.520]  has ordered to stand down according to the Border Patrol President and Vice
[01:08:35.520 --> 01:08:41.560]  President and then four weeks ago almost we shot video of eyewitnesses, ice
[01:08:41.560 --> 01:08:46.000]  whistleblowers, the head of emergency management in McAllen, Texas saying
[01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:50.320]  they're ordered to load them on gray on buses, give them vouchers to go anywhere
[01:08:50.320 --> 01:08:55.320]  they want and to release them and that's been confirmed as of last week by the
[01:08:55.320 --> 01:09:01.520]  New York Times. The White House admitted it and the Republican leadership is
[01:09:01.520 --> 01:09:08.480]  still going gee we don't know why this is happening. Obama ought to fix it. Fix it.
[01:09:08.480 --> 01:09:12.680]  If you walk up to somebody and hit them in the head with a hatchet and kill them
[01:09:12.680 --> 01:09:17.640]  and the cops come up and say you need to fix that, no you go to jail for capital
[01:09:17.640 --> 01:09:23.240]  murder, you premeditatedly hack somebody in the head and kill them. They open the
[01:09:23.240 --> 01:09:30.040]  borders and we can't even get this bankrupt evil political class to admit
[01:09:30.040 --> 01:09:33.400]  that they're doing this on purpose and again I'm gonna explain something. They've
[01:09:33.400 --> 01:09:36.280]  already got wages driven down, they've already got 30 million illegals in this
[01:09:36.280 --> 01:09:41.920]  country. Most big U.S. cities already look like war zones. I mean Southern
[01:09:41.920 --> 01:09:46.320]  California looks like hell. Dallas looks like hell now. I grew up there. This
[01:09:46.320 --> 01:09:53.900]  country's in a depression. They don't need more to bankrupt us. It hit me and I've
[01:09:53.900 --> 01:09:58.560]  been saying this for a while but it really hit me how right I was that this
[01:09:58.560 --> 01:10:04.440]  is the Detroitification of the nation by design, clowered and pivoted on
[01:10:04.440 --> 01:10:11.040]  steroids and that we knew the last six months waves of illegals have been
[01:10:11.040 --> 01:10:15.280]  hitting hard and the crime has been exploding in the Southwest. All the
[01:10:15.280 --> 01:10:19.640]  numbers are there and now this big advertisement all over the world that you
[01:10:19.640 --> 01:10:23.800]  get here this is gonna cause a mega wave and I know I'm stating the obvious but
[01:10:23.800 --> 01:10:28.800]  no one else is pointing it out. We need to have articles about what the mega wave
[01:10:28.800 --> 01:10:34.120]  will look like and I know I say this on air and then Breitbart and others do it
[01:10:34.120 --> 01:10:38.320]  and World End Daily. I'm glad. Please go do the article. Last week I said
[01:10:38.320 --> 01:10:41.880]  the article about Robert Rodriguez and Obama set to meet tonight and Breitbart
[01:10:41.880 --> 01:10:49.640]  did yesterday finally but again my folks were overwhelmed so they're doing a
[01:10:49.640 --> 01:10:56.120]  great job. It's just that these are the big issues and it's very lonely to
[01:10:56.120 --> 01:11:01.720]  continue to hit right on what's happening and to state the obvious. It's like
[01:11:01.720 --> 01:11:07.320]  getting up, walking on your back porch at 6 a.m. watching the sun coming up and
[01:11:07.320 --> 01:11:11.120]  saying hey honey come out here and see the sunrise and your wife runs out and
[01:11:11.120 --> 01:11:18.120]  goes I've never seen that before you must be racist. That's the analogy. Hey look
[01:11:18.120 --> 01:11:21.040]  they're overflowing us with all these people who are totally illegal they're
[01:11:21.040 --> 01:11:23.960]  legalizing them that will fully collapse the border because they put them on
[01:11:23.960 --> 01:11:28.560]  welfare that'll bring tens of millions more. Quickly it'll collapse everything.
[01:11:28.560 --> 01:11:37.160]  Why are you a racist? I mean I'm simply pointing out what's happening and like
[01:11:37.160 --> 01:11:41.200]  the Democratic Party followers they write articles every day attacking us
[01:11:41.200 --> 01:11:46.640]  making jokes about us like they're on some winning team and it's funny what's
[01:11:46.640 --> 01:11:49.400]  happening. It's not funny they're getting the Pentagon ready to take their
[01:11:49.400 --> 01:11:53.600]  pension funds and Marshall lost standing by. It's not funny that these third
[01:11:53.600 --> 01:11:58.120]  worlds have been collapsed and now we're collapsing. This is real sociology, real
[01:11:58.120 --> 01:12:04.400]  anthropology. I mean this is a fact folks. This country is being shut down, is
[01:12:04.400 --> 01:12:08.680]  being ended. They don't want a prosperous middle class and an upwardly
[01:12:08.680 --> 01:12:15.160]  mobile working class. They want poor dumb down people and when they're done
[01:12:15.160 --> 01:12:18.960]  bankrupting the country none of you people are getting welfare anymore so
[01:12:18.960 --> 01:12:25.160]  get rid of that. Get ready for that. They're gonna bring in fascism on the
[01:12:25.160 --> 01:12:34.280]  back of this and that's what clicked. The only way I'll survive and not be taken
[01:12:34.280 --> 01:12:38.480]  out down the road is to become a fascist and to become an ultra right-wing
[01:12:38.480 --> 01:12:42.840]  operative and to let the Democrats do all this on purpose and wreck everything
[01:12:42.840 --> 01:12:47.320]  and then be part of a pro-government fascist movement in the future and I'm
[01:12:47.320 --> 01:12:52.160]  not gonna do it. I'm gonna take the right course of Liberty Truth and Justice
[01:12:52.160 --> 01:12:56.760]  for humanity and I'm gonna be hated by the black racist, the white racist, the
[01:12:56.760 --> 01:13:01.840]  Hispanic racist, everybody in their own little gang group. All ignorant, all being
[01:13:01.840 --> 01:13:06.680]  losers, all being chumps, being played like fools by this system because I'll
[01:13:06.680 --> 01:13:11.200]  tell you I'm not worried about he that can kill my body. I'm worried about losing
[01:13:11.200 --> 01:13:14.680]  my soul and I'm worried about losing my family name and I'm worried about
[01:13:14.680 --> 01:13:19.320]  bringing bad mojo on my family. You can use whatever term you want.
[01:13:19.320 --> 01:13:25.080]  Repoach is so karma. Everybody in their gut knows when you do bad stuff it's not
[01:13:25.080 --> 01:13:29.160]  just that you have a conscience and feel bad about what you did. You know it's
[01:13:29.160 --> 01:13:33.160]  coming back on you and it ain't coming back on you when you die. Oh, it comes
[01:13:33.160 --> 01:13:39.840]  back then too. It comes back in this life and I'm a very moral upright person
[01:13:39.840 --> 01:13:46.320]  looking back in retrospective in my life. Okay? Straight shooter all the way. Have
[01:13:46.320 --> 01:13:54.240]  anger issues but that's about it and I can tell you I shake deep down with
[01:13:54.240 --> 01:13:58.280]  concern for the things I've done and knowing it'll be brought back on me and
[01:13:58.280 --> 01:14:03.440]  guess who else? And I knock on wood here. Please God, pass over my kids. I
[01:14:03.440 --> 01:14:10.200]  spiritually put the blood right on the right on the doorpost every day but man
[01:14:10.200 --> 01:14:14.040]  this stuff comes back on your kids. I'll tell you right now all you people that
[01:14:14.040 --> 01:14:17.920]  are serving the system, you wonder why you're losers, you wonder why you're
[01:14:17.920 --> 01:14:21.880]  unfulfilled, you wonder why your failures. It's because you've served a lie
[01:14:21.880 --> 01:14:28.880]  and a fraud and America has bought into so many lives. I was talking to a friend
[01:14:28.880 --> 01:14:33.760]  last night whose grandfather was a Super Trailblazer made hundreds of
[01:14:33.760 --> 01:14:41.400]  millions of dollars in 1940s, 50s, 60s money. His great-grandfather actually
[01:14:41.400 --> 01:14:46.280]  related to President Johnson, you name it. And I was talking to my buddy last
[01:14:46.280 --> 01:14:52.400]  night and we're saying, yeah, professional wrestling. How do people go and watch it
[01:14:52.400 --> 01:14:57.440]  and go along with it like it's real? And somebody's grandpa knew all the stuff,
[01:14:57.440 --> 01:15:00.400]  knew everything but would sit there and watch professional wrestling and would
[01:15:00.400 --> 01:15:06.160]  say, I don't get why that boy didn't beat that boy. I thought that big one would win.
[01:15:06.720 --> 01:15:14.440]  And the realization hit that, no, no, he was just lying to himself to enjoy it,
[01:15:14.440 --> 01:15:21.000]  suspend the disbelief as a joke. But what about the people at a wrestling event?
[01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:26.800]  All they're playing along together like it's real and it hit me. That's what the
[01:15:26.800 --> 01:15:31.760]  Democratic Party is and the Republicans to another lesser extent. And that's
[01:15:31.760 --> 01:15:36.440]  what all this is, is you just buy into a fantasy while you're being fed into a
[01:15:36.440 --> 01:15:42.200]  meat grinder and I've been to the other side. I know what's on the other end.
[01:15:42.200 --> 01:15:45.520]  I'm like, don't go in there. That's a slaughterhouse. And they look at me and
[01:15:45.520 --> 01:15:53.840]  go, Obama, shut up and feel good and go running into it. And so the words going
[01:15:53.840 --> 01:16:00.520]  out in hellish, hellish Latin America. In the most hellish areas, some areas are
[01:16:00.520 --> 01:16:04.480]  wonderful, but in the most hellish areas, people that are successful don't want to
[01:16:04.480 --> 01:16:11.000]  come here. In Chile, one of the few good places left. I've looked into it, believe
[01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:21.880]  me. And the people that have skills and stuff aren't going to come here. We are
[01:16:21.880 --> 01:16:29.280]  literally getting the dregs. And it just, it will hurt everyone, but it doesn't
[01:16:29.280 --> 01:16:33.640]  matter because it's like the Democrats are winning, the Hispanics are winning,
[01:16:33.640 --> 01:16:38.680]  the whites are failing. Now don't shut up now. Don't be racially based. I mean, and
[01:16:38.680 --> 01:16:43.480]  it's all an illusion, all the fraud, cheating us all, destroying all of our
[01:16:43.480 --> 01:16:47.680]  futures. I have a big stack of breaking news on what's happening, but up on
[01:16:47.680 --> 01:16:51.080]  infowars.com and we're going to Staff Sergeant Joe Biggs in this segment, the
[01:16:51.080 --> 01:16:56.640]  next, then Jakari Jackson reporting, reporting from Marietta, California,
[01:16:56.640 --> 01:17:11.320]  Patriots Outnumber, Amnesty Supporters, 20 to 1. ISIS destroys antiquities en masse.
[01:17:11.320 --> 01:17:19.320]  I mean, this is just unbelievable. The scum of the earth that Al Qaeda is,
[01:17:19.320 --> 01:17:25.120]  mutilating women, destroying beautiful works of art, just absolute demons, and
[01:17:25.120 --> 01:17:29.560]  then run by our criminal government. See how it's all just over the top? See how
[01:17:29.560 --> 01:17:34.680]  it's just all over the top as they butcher Syria and Iraq, as they butcher
[01:17:34.680 --> 01:17:39.440]  Christians, as they blow up churches, and it's just so over the top. It's so over
[01:17:39.440 --> 01:17:43.800]  the top, they're shipping in unlimited illegals and saying, your races, if you
[01:17:43.800 --> 01:17:46.720]  don't accept it. And the political correctness is so strong, the average
[01:17:46.720 --> 01:17:51.000]  conservative falls down on their knees and says, okay, I accept it. And then,
[01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:54.840]  meanwhile, our government's funding Al Qaeda, and I've actually heard news, you
[01:17:54.840 --> 01:18:00.320]  know, is part of the Islamic backlash, anti-Islamic or Arab? You know, if you
[01:18:00.320 --> 01:18:02.920]  don't want Christians having their churches blown up, you're against
[01:18:02.920 --> 01:18:06.840]  Muslims, or you're against Arabs. When it's Arab Christians being killed, it's
[01:18:06.840 --> 01:18:13.480]  just mindlessness. It's cult programming. The good news is people are starting to
[01:18:13.480 --> 01:18:17.520]  listen. Congress has a 7% approval rating. The warm is turning. Obama's desperate.
[01:18:17.520 --> 01:18:22.760]  Democratic reps say he's acting bizarre, aloof, detached. Confidence is collapsing,
[01:18:22.760 --> 01:18:28.800]  but he's too dangerous to leave an office. Too dangerous to leave an office. I
[01:18:28.800 --> 01:18:33.040]  agree with Pat Buchanan. You'd get big libertarian conservative wins if he
[01:18:33.040 --> 01:18:36.960]  stays in, but that's if he doesn't set a nuke off in Manhattan and declare
[01:18:36.960 --> 01:18:41.360]  martial law. That's, I mean, that's if in a year, it may be a million a month
[01:18:41.360 --> 01:18:45.600]  showing up, not a hundred thousand. I mean, we're in a stinking collapse here,
[01:18:45.600 --> 01:18:51.800]  folks. We can't wait two years. We need to punish him. We need to punish the
[01:18:51.800 --> 01:18:56.480]  Republicans so they're scared. We don't need to stop with Obama. We need to
[01:18:56.480 --> 01:19:01.080]  impeach Boehner. And when it all comes out that he knew about Fast and Furious,
[01:19:01.080 --> 01:19:04.200]  we need to arrest Boehner. And I don't say that where I get a thrill of
[01:19:04.200 --> 01:19:08.280]  arresting people. I mean, they need to be arrested. Have you read what they were
[01:19:08.280 --> 01:19:11.960]  going to arrest Nixon over if he didn't step down when he was impeached in the
[01:19:11.960 --> 01:19:16.880]  House being tried to the Senate? It's nothing compared to what Obama's done.
[01:19:16.880 --> 01:19:20.040]  Have you read the Declaration of Independence? I'm going to read it later
[01:19:20.040 --> 01:19:24.880]  in conjunction with impeachment because the Declaration of Independence
[01:19:24.880 --> 01:19:31.280]  was a impeachment of the King of England. But I may even cancel some guests or
[01:19:31.280 --> 01:19:34.880]  something today, so I have time to cover this. I mean, this is important, big stuff.
[01:19:34.880 --> 01:19:40.280]  Do you understand? I can feel it in my gut. I can see it intellectually. I can see it
[01:19:40.280 --> 01:19:46.160]  on every front. You can see it. But in my gut, in my spirit, intellectually,
[01:19:46.160 --> 01:19:50.400]  politically, on every front, they're going to go for broke. Man, these people
[01:19:50.400 --> 01:19:57.040]  could do anything. So, just for survival, Obama needs to be clapped and
[01:19:57.040 --> 01:20:03.000]  irons immediately. You are now in the crosshairs. The NSA and the FBI are
[01:20:03.000 --> 01:20:07.360]  treating you like a criminal and monitoring your every move. Ron Paul said
[01:20:07.360 --> 01:20:11.360]  recently, the evidence of the totalitarian nature of this government is on
[01:20:11.360 --> 01:20:15.960]  display undeniably every day. What's taking place right now is a coup and the
[01:20:15.960 --> 01:20:20.080]  destruction of the Constitution. But a friend and patriot has discovered a
[01:20:20.080 --> 01:20:24.120]  loophole. Find out about the NSA loophole before they shut it down at

[01:21:59.880 --> 01:22:03.760]  important information. I want to tell you about Matt Redhawk and his team of
[01:22:03.760 --> 01:22:07.960]  patriots over at MyPatriot Supply. Several years ago, Matt was sitting in
[01:22:07.960 --> 01:22:11.280]  his two-bedroom apartment, frustrated with the direction this country was headed
[01:22:11.280 --> 01:22:15.160]  and the charlatans willing to sell us out for a quick buck. Deciding to take
[01:22:15.160 --> 01:22:20.320]  action, a company run by patriots for patriots was born. MyPatriot Supply has

[01:24:08.800 --> 01:24:14.560]  Well, the Iraqi government's been racist. They're not welcoming the new
[01:24:14.560 --> 01:24:19.920]  migrants, the 100,000 or so ISIS al Qaeda people from Saudi Arabia and other
[01:24:19.920 --> 01:24:24.800]  places who are taking over and murdering all the Christians and any
[01:24:24.800 --> 01:24:29.520]  Muslim Shiites they find while blowing up mosque churches, you name it.
[01:24:29.520 --> 01:24:35.120]  Infowars.com has the report. It's also in the BBC. Mask demolishers destroy the tomb
[01:24:35.120 --> 01:24:41.680]  of Jonah in Mosul with sledgehammers. And we have the video of that up on
[01:24:41.680 --> 01:24:50.120]  infowars.com. I thought that I would add that Jonah is one of the main prophets,
[01:24:50.120 --> 01:24:57.520]  peace be upon him, of the Muslim faith. So that shows you in the Korean. So that
[01:24:57.520 --> 01:25:01.960]  shows you how out of control al Qaeda ISIS is. I mean these people are like
[01:25:01.960 --> 01:25:05.840]  devil worshipers, ladies and gentlemen, eating hearts, running around, murdering
[01:25:05.840 --> 01:25:13.640]  people, raping whoever they want. They are a bunch of scum. Jonas, peace be upon
[01:25:13.640 --> 01:25:18.680]  him. This is from Islam 101 is also addressed by the two other surnames.
[01:25:18.680 --> 01:25:24.560]  Done none. Lord of the fish. And then it goes on to Holy Quran says and they're
[01:25:24.560 --> 01:25:29.960]  destroying that. That's the religion of peace now by the globalist. That's what
[01:25:29.960 --> 01:25:35.880]  they're doing with al Qaeda radicalizing Islam. You could debate was Islam
[01:25:35.880 --> 01:25:39.440]  radical? Wasn't it radical? There's different sex and groups. If you're not
[01:25:39.440 --> 01:25:47.880]  a radical, you're dead. And these groups kill other Sunnis. And I wanted to get
[01:25:47.880 --> 01:25:51.680]  Staff Sergeant Joe Biggs take on this because he's fought against these same
[01:25:51.680 --> 01:25:56.600]  groups in Afghanistan and Iraq. But he's also out in California with huge
[01:25:56.600 --> 01:26:02.040]  breaking news on a whole bunch of fronts that are up on infowars.com. Some of it
[01:26:02.040 --> 01:26:04.600]  hasn't broke yet. He's going to break it at the start of the next segment. Then
[01:26:04.600 --> 01:26:12.040]  we're going to Jacari Jackson. But I have a piece here of the actual place
[01:26:12.040 --> 01:26:17.120]  where Jonah did a lot of his preaching in Nineveh where they got their hundred
[01:26:17.120 --> 01:26:22.360]  year of a preve, a piece of pottery pre Christ in my hand. If you're watching us
[01:26:22.360 --> 01:26:28.960]  on TV at infowarsnews.com or on the free feed at infowars.com. For this last
[01:26:28.960 --> 01:26:32.640]  show you can see that. Or by tomorrow I'll have a video of this part of the
[01:26:32.640 --> 01:26:36.580]  show posted for everybody, for radio listeners. But it just shows the out-of-
[01:26:36.580 --> 01:26:41.320]  control nature and our government won't even decry these people, won't even send
[01:26:41.320 --> 01:26:47.200]  predators to take them out. Well of course because they put them there. So Joe
[01:26:47.200 --> 01:26:51.840]  Biggs, I want to throw a curveball at you and get your take on that. And then
[01:26:51.840 --> 01:26:56.880]  we'll talk about this other invasion just as dangerous, this this this welfare
[01:26:56.880 --> 01:27:02.520]  invasion. But I guess you're there in a Marietta, California right now. Yes, Joe
[01:27:02.520 --> 01:27:08.560]  Biggs here infowars.com and Marietta, California. Last night the sheriff
[01:27:08.560 --> 01:27:15.440]  actually of Marietta announced that he is going to arrest anybody who tries to
[01:27:15.440 --> 01:27:19.920]  stop these buses now. Before they were allowing them, the people came together
[01:27:19.920 --> 01:27:23.000]  and said you know what, you know the police department was like we're for
[01:27:23.000 --> 01:27:26.880]  this, we understand. But a lot of the pro-amnesty people have called and
[01:27:26.880 --> 01:27:31.160]  complained now. And now they're saying that anybody who tries to come in here
[01:27:31.160 --> 01:27:35.400]  tomorrow and stop any of these buses from coming in will be arrested. Well
[01:27:35.400 --> 01:27:40.040]  that's bombshell. I have not seen that in the news yet. If Kit Daniels gets a
[01:27:40.040 --> 01:27:45.300]  blurb report out on that, Watson can expand on it. So please give us the full
[01:27:45.300 --> 01:27:49.480]  details. This is very very newsworthy that they're not gonna have the feds do it
[01:27:49.480 --> 01:27:52.800]  now. I guess they have riot police. They're gonna have the sheriff's department
[01:27:52.800 --> 01:27:57.720]  as part of treason do this to try to stop citizens blocking federal crime
[01:27:57.720 --> 01:28:01.520]  committing. I mean it's funny because this is such a small town. I mean you
[01:28:01.520 --> 01:28:04.920]  know everybody here is gonna know each other. So when it comes down to the the
[01:28:04.920 --> 01:28:08.360]  police showing up it's gonna be like you know Bob you know stop why are you
[01:28:08.360 --> 01:28:13.000]  doing this you know that's how small the town is. Well we're gonna get more
[01:28:13.000 --> 01:28:16.160]  details of that right now after we go to break with you the county the name of
[01:28:16.160 --> 01:28:20.280]  the sheriff all the details it's Riverside County, Marietta County will
[01:28:20.280 --> 01:28:23.640]  get all the info on the sheriff in a report. Where did you get this
[01:28:23.640 --> 01:28:28.960]  information? I saw it on an article last night Alex. Okay so this is broken this
[01:28:28.960 --> 01:28:33.720]  is broken locally but not nationally. Can you tell us what he said? Yeah he said
[01:28:33.720 --> 01:28:38.360]  that you know due to the the pro-amnesty people calling in and complaining they
[01:28:38.360 --> 01:28:41.800]  said that what the protesters were doing the anti-illegal immigration
[01:28:41.800 --> 01:28:45.720]  protesters were doing were interfering with law enforcement and that was
[01:28:45.720 --> 01:28:50.400]  breaking the law. So now they feel like they need to step in and you know save
[01:28:50.400 --> 01:28:54.960]  face. Okay well I'm gonna be specific here. It's the feds breaking the law
[01:28:54.960 --> 01:28:58.560]  busting any legal so then give them bus tickets wherever they want to go. Each
[01:28:58.560 --> 01:29:03.320]  time that's human trafficking and a felony and you've got video and a report
[01:29:03.320 --> 01:29:09.720]  with Jacari up on infowords.com. 20 to 1, 20, I wouldn't call them anti-immigration.
[01:29:09.720 --> 01:29:16.280]  They're pro, follow-the-law, pro-survival, pro-sovereignty. Go ahead. Well right
[01:29:16.280 --> 01:29:19.800]  here right now there's not one pro-amnesty person. Their side of the
[01:29:19.800 --> 01:29:24.960]  area if you want to pan over real quick look is completely empty. There's no one
[01:29:24.960 --> 01:29:30.240]  here in support of amnesty and yet we have people over here they're lining up
[01:29:30.240 --> 01:29:35.600]  on this side to support the anti-illegal immigration. You know people in
[01:29:35.600 --> 01:29:39.280]  this town have come together and they said enough is enough. Stay there Joe
[01:29:39.280 --> 01:29:43.040]  Biggs. I want to come back to you. This is big. A showdown. They're saying more
[01:29:43.040 --> 01:29:46.320]  buses are coming tonight. That's the breaking news. The local group is gonna
[01:29:46.320 --> 01:29:50.200]  stop them. The sheriff says he's gonna arrest them. We're on the march. The
[01:29:50.200 --> 01:29:57.120]  Empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[01:30:57.200 --> 01:31:03.440]  ranch. City of Austin tap water versus filtered City of Austin tap water. I
[01:31:03.440 --> 01:31:07.240]  didn't I taste dirt in it. God knows what's in this. These people just sampled
[01:31:07.240 --> 01:31:11.280]  City of Austin tap water straight from the faucet. Next we had them try a
[01:31:11.280 --> 01:31:16.600]  sample of tap water filtered for the Pro Pure G2.0 filtration system. Now one is
[01:31:16.600 --> 01:31:20.320]  better. Tastes like nothing. Yep I know a good water tastes like it's good water.
[01:31:20.320 --> 01:31:25.600]  Most tap water contains added substances like fluoride, chlorine, glyphosate and
[01:31:25.600 --> 01:31:29.440]  many others. Studies prove that these substances are linked to an assortment of
[01:31:29.440 --> 01:31:33.960]  major health issues including tooth decay, lower IQ and even cancer. It tastes
[01:31:33.960 --> 01:31:38.280]  like you're drinking out of the lake when you're in top water. The Pro Pure G2.0
[01:31:38.280 --> 01:31:42.800]  filtration system removes these deadly substances leaving only fresh tasting
[01:31:42.800 --> 01:31:47.080]  deliciously clean water. Okay this is very tasty. It's good water. Refreshing.

[01:32:00.640 --> 01:32:04.200]  few years ago because it was helping me and my family so much get healthy and
[01:32:04.200 --> 01:32:09.520]  detoxify. Most people know that iodine deficiency has been a crisis around the
[01:32:09.520 --> 01:32:14.320]  world. Iodine is key to so many of the body's functions especially the
[01:32:14.320 --> 01:32:18.760]  thyroid. I discovered a product being developed by Dr. Group. You now know it
[01:32:18.760 --> 01:32:23.760]  as survival shield true nascent iodine that your body can really absorb. Then
[01:32:23.760 --> 01:32:27.440]  about a year ago he said listen if you think this is powerful I'm going to come
[01:32:27.440 --> 01:32:32.760]  out with rare earth deep earth crystals and the results that I personally have
[01:32:32.760 --> 01:32:38.600]  had have been life-changing. Nobody else has got iodine based on these pure

[01:33:45.880 --> 01:33:53.920]  The Marine Corps veteran to Morrissey over 101 days in a Mexican jail chained
[01:33:53.920 --> 01:34:01.040]  down to a bed seeing no lawyer because of international outcry finally gets a
[01:34:01.040 --> 01:34:08.480]  day in court. But Mexico complains if illegals aren't given hot meals
[01:34:08.480 --> 01:34:13.400]  immediately and legalized. I mean what a joke. Mexico will punch you in the nose
[01:34:13.400 --> 01:34:20.320]  shake you down. This is a guy going down to the border area took a wrong road on
[01:34:20.320 --> 01:34:25.160]  the highway drove up to the Mexican border had guns in his car and they were
[01:34:25.160 --> 01:34:31.120]  like yippie-ki-yay we gotcha. After 101 days in Mexican prison Marine sergeant
[01:34:31.120 --> 01:34:36.600]  arrives for day in court and I was seeing video of him in the Mexican jail
[01:34:36.600 --> 01:34:46.040]  chained down to the bed. We basically are a giant toilet for Mexico. All their
[01:34:46.040 --> 01:34:51.480]  criminals all their drugs all their drugs everything just dump it on us and I see
[01:34:51.480 --> 01:34:55.160]  stories all the time I know people who'll get talked into going hunting in
[01:34:55.160 --> 01:34:59.640]  Mexico where you can go down there and go to a special game event and then they
[01:34:59.640 --> 01:35:02.960]  have locally run things with shotguns where you can hunt pheasant or whatever
[01:35:02.960 --> 01:35:08.160]  or quail and they'll have police when you drive in and they'll tear your whole
[01:35:08.160 --> 01:35:13.720]  call your entire car apart if they find an empty shotgun casing in the back of
[01:35:13.720 --> 01:35:17.880]  your truck you're talking years in jail and then they run your credit shake down
[01:35:17.880 --> 01:35:21.920]  your family and suck everything out of your family or they basically kill you
[01:35:21.920 --> 01:35:28.240]  in a lot of cases in jail. So he accidentally crossed into Mexico finally
[01:35:28.240 --> 01:35:35.960]  to get his day in court after 100 days behind bars this Marine sergeant he got
[01:35:35.960 --> 01:35:43.440]  confused and drove the wrong way which I've almost done before and again my
[01:35:43.440 --> 01:35:48.480]  whole point is Mexico is extremely oppressive but then we get lectured all
[01:35:48.480 --> 01:35:53.000]  day because we are such bleeding hearts in America we are so politically
[01:35:53.000 --> 01:35:58.080]  correct it's pathetic. Now if you go to Marietta, California where Joe Biggs is
[01:35:58.080 --> 01:36:02.000]  right now with Jakari Jackson who we're gonna go to next you've got a bunch of
[01:36:02.000 --> 01:36:05.920]  breaking news but you heard it we're gonna article out on this the local
[01:36:05.920 --> 01:36:13.960]  sheriff is saying he's gonna arrest people tonight if they try to stop the
[01:36:13.960 --> 01:36:18.240]  bus which they continue to do and what an image that's gonna be to allow the
[01:36:18.240 --> 01:36:23.000]  criminal buses to come across with DHS involved in sedition against this
[01:36:23.000 --> 01:36:27.520]  country and against law to set the precedent to do anything and and this
[01:36:27.520 --> 01:36:32.080]  is coming tonight so Joe give us details Joe Biggs and tell us what time those

[01:37:10.480 --> 01:37:14.960]  we're having more and more people show up Alex we've got Main Street media up
[01:37:14.960 --> 01:37:18.800]  and down the street all around me parked here everybody's expecting this bus to be
[01:37:18.800 --> 01:37:23.760]  coming in sometime either tonight or early in the morning people are just
[01:37:23.760 --> 01:37:27.760]  piling in because they want to be here in support of what's going on another
[01:37:27.760 --> 01:37:33.440]  city down the road Escondido had a town hall meeting yesterday that 500 people
[01:37:33.440 --> 01:37:38.240]  showed up to and they wanted to open up 96 homes for these illegal alien
[01:37:38.240 --> 01:37:42.120]  children to stay in and the town came together once again another town came
[01:37:42.120 --> 01:37:46.560]  together and said no you're not gonna do that and the council voted against it
[01:37:46.560 --> 01:37:52.800]  and they stopped that from happening now. This is just crazy town in fact I
[01:37:52.800 --> 01:37:56.000]  meant to have the reporters do this but never got around to it I think I'm gonna
[01:37:56.000 --> 01:38:00.960]  do this as a stunt I think I'm gonna go knock on Robert Rodriguez's door not
[01:38:00.960 --> 01:38:06.600]  tonight while Obama is there at his house but in the future and I'm gonna go
[01:38:06.600 --> 01:38:11.640]  knock and I'm gonna say I'm gonna go pick up some of these day laborers and
[01:38:11.640 --> 01:38:17.360]  I'm gonna bring them to his door and say take them in like Nancy Pelosi says
[01:38:17.360 --> 01:38:21.360]  of course Robert Rodriguez is worth hundreds of millions of dollars and you
[01:38:21.360 --> 01:38:25.880]  know lives in the richly rich part of town it's just such a fraud no one
[01:38:25.880 --> 01:38:31.960]  does this we have the most open country the most welfare of anywhere and all it
[01:38:31.960 --> 01:38:37.120]  does is gets us called racist because we won't take more I mean this is crazy.
[01:38:37.120 --> 01:38:41.360]  All the people that are for bringing these kids in are the ones who are the
[01:38:41.360 --> 01:38:45.040]  last ones that are gonna even take them in like you said Nancy Pelosi is
[01:38:45.040 --> 01:38:48.440]  talking about doing it but you're not gonna see Nancy Pelosi with a van full
[01:38:48.440 --> 01:38:52.000]  little kids going home directly. Exactly here's the challenge here's the
[01:38:52.000 --> 01:38:55.880]  challenge we should bust we should have a law that is that if they're gonna
[01:38:55.880 --> 01:39:00.040]  violate law under this they have to bust them to DC and dump them off in Hyde
[01:39:00.040 --> 01:39:07.480]  Park at Wolf Blitzer's house or at Chris Matthews house or at the White House
[01:39:07.480 --> 01:39:12.040]  how about the White House take in a thousand families how about that? Alex I
[01:39:12.040 --> 01:39:16.400]  started a White House petition the other day that says that we should send all of
[01:39:16.400 --> 01:39:20.600]  the illegal alien children to the White House to stay with the Obama family.
[01:39:20.600 --> 01:39:23.800]  Okay well that should have been a major news article on infowars.com that's
[01:39:23.800 --> 01:39:29.760]  total genius Joe. I want to get a blurb out on that right now by Paul Watson or
[01:39:29.760 --> 01:39:35.600]  Steve Watson or somebody and what's the name of the petition? That to send all
[01:39:35.600 --> 01:39:40.720]  illegal alien children to the Obama to the White House. And we should point out
[01:39:40.720 --> 01:39:44.320]  because they want us all to pay for it yeah go ahead. I have a link I'll email it
[01:39:44.320 --> 01:39:48.440]  to someone back there. All right well or we can come up with another one too and
[01:39:48.440 --> 01:39:53.960]  add even more that they be bust equally to Michael Morn's house, Nancy Pelosi's,
[01:39:53.960 --> 01:40:00.120]  Chris Matthews house, the White House and that Congress host maybe a couple
[01:40:00.120 --> 01:40:04.560]  thousand families they're in the corridors how about each Democratic
[01:40:04.560 --> 01:40:11.800]  congressman or woman how about they take 10 families inside of each office? I
[01:40:11.800 --> 01:40:17.840]  think we can get that done. Well Joe you know if they don't they're racist. Of
[01:40:17.840 --> 01:40:22.360]  course I mean everybody's racist in America. We're all evil terrorists racist
[01:40:22.360 --> 01:40:27.040]  people who put up fences and then we're racist for that they stick here our
[01:40:27.040 --> 01:40:34.640]  borders. When we border collapsing Latin America Joe how big do you think it's
[01:40:34.640 --> 01:40:38.240]  gonna get when we already have an unsustainable flood 30 million
[01:40:38.240 --> 01:40:42.240]  illegals here country going bankrupt California totally bankrupt all the
[01:40:42.240 --> 01:40:46.400]  states going bankrupt and they're busing illegals all over the country and then
[01:40:46.400 --> 01:40:52.120]  the police chief and them and the judge in Grand Prairie Texas a huge city by
[01:40:52.120 --> 01:40:57.640]  Dallas says I'm going to your door to tell you not to protest or you might get
[01:40:57.640 --> 01:41:01.280]  arrested I mean if somebody came to my door and said you better not come out
[01:41:01.280 --> 01:41:05.480]  and protest or we might arrest you I would definitely go protest how has our
[01:41:05.480 --> 01:41:10.600]  country become so pathetic that our police and our the people that run our
[01:41:10.600 --> 01:41:18.280]  military and our judges are in Dallas our literal scum of the earth threatening
[01:41:18.280 --> 01:41:22.560]  people you better let us take all these illegals in Dallas or we'll arrest you
[01:41:22.560 --> 01:41:28.760]  you better not get uppity I mean my god that is like North Korea it is indeed I
[01:41:28.760 --> 01:41:31.760]  mean there's so many people who aren't awake that are lazy they don't even know
[01:41:31.760 --> 01:41:34.800]  their rights there's so many people that get illegally searched all the time
[01:41:34.800 --> 01:41:38.520]  because they don't know their rights so many people in America are just sleeping
[01:41:38.520 --> 01:41:41.760]  on what's going on and that's how it's getting to this point they just don't
[01:41:41.760 --> 01:41:46.440]  care they want to live their boring life every day turn on their TV drink their
[01:41:46.440 --> 01:41:49.920]  coffee go to work every day ignore what's really going on in the country and
[01:41:49.920 --> 01:41:53.000]  that's why it's gotten to this point just people don't care for the most part
[01:41:53.000 --> 01:41:56.480]  but there's a lot of us out here who are trying to wake people up and that's
[01:41:56.480 --> 01:42:01.760]  what info wars.com does I mean it's the people here Marietta are proof of
[01:42:01.760 --> 01:42:05.920]  people standing up against tyranny and saying you know what go back we're not
[01:42:05.920 --> 01:42:09.160]  going to take you here you're not going to collapse our town you're not going to
[01:42:09.160 --> 01:42:13.640]  make us go bankrupt well I saw the mayor on television last night he was saying
[01:42:13.640 --> 01:42:19.240]  60 million has been sent in the last three years just on the illegals property
[01:42:19.240 --> 01:42:25.000]  taxes are exploding people are moving out of the middle-class area and the
[01:42:25.000 --> 01:42:28.720]  government's not even reimbursing the city and then you've got the county
[01:42:28.720 --> 01:42:35.040]  saying if citizens try to stop this we're gonna arrest you it's mind-blowing
[01:42:35.040 --> 01:42:41.040]  that even gets us I mean that's it's 1984 completely right now well the local
[01:42:41.040 --> 01:42:45.880]  Chronicle told the sheriff not to even deport 11 aggravated or 13 aggravated
[01:42:45.880 --> 01:42:50.200]  felons the average is 11 but it said last week he deported 13 and they were
[01:42:50.200 --> 01:42:56.280]  like hyperventilating huh huh a thousand's arrested huh they deported
[01:42:56.280 --> 01:43:00.560]  13 and then the sheriff goes their felons they've committed crimes before
[01:43:00.560 --> 01:43:05.520]  they have rap sheets and with a straight face they go how racist I mean that
[01:43:05.520 --> 01:43:13.040]  shows how crazy town this has gotten where where I don't even know what to
[01:43:13.040 --> 01:43:15.800]  say about the Democrats at this point I mean I think they've gone completely
[01:43:15.800 --> 01:43:20.800]  insane I mean everything's racist with them it's just race baiting you know one
[01:43:20.800 --> 01:43:24.600]  thing after another after another they create tension between people to divide
[01:43:24.600 --> 01:43:28.320]  everybody that's all they want to do is divide everybody and bust them down and
[01:43:28.320 --> 01:43:32.080]  make them you know with this white guilt and all this other junk it's ridiculous
[01:43:32.080 --> 01:43:37.280]  it's just a side but it's a mind game I mean it's really starting to get to me
[01:43:37.280 --> 01:43:40.880]  because I mean these people are insane and there's an article out today that
[01:43:40.880 --> 01:43:47.240]  Democrats are ripping Obama saying he's aloof detached acting bizarre that's in
[01:43:47.240 --> 01:43:51.520]  the weekly standard and now but now Banner saying that he doesn't even want
[01:43:51.520 --> 01:43:55.280]  to impeach Obama it's like you Hulk Hogan and the iron cheek on stage or
[01:43:55.280 --> 01:43:58.760]  enemies but back in the you know behind the scenes or buddy buddy hanging out
[01:43:58.760 --> 01:44:05.360]  that's all that's going on man it's making me sick and I gotta tell you we
[01:44:05.360 --> 01:44:09.360]  could take a hundred million third world people there's over six billion poor
[01:44:09.360 --> 01:44:15.840]  people worldwide I mean I was watching some liberal lady last night on an
[01:44:15.840 --> 01:44:20.240]  episode of naked and afraid and it was all about how the man needs to do what
[01:44:20.240 --> 01:44:24.480]  she says or his rating isn't high and I watched three episodes each episode is
[01:44:24.480 --> 01:44:28.320]  about a man submitting is what makes him a great man and how men are bad and
[01:44:28.320 --> 01:44:33.200]  men from the south are bad you could see how they scripted it's all staged and
[01:44:33.200 --> 01:44:38.240]  only men that do what they're told are good and so it's all about how men are
[01:44:38.240 --> 01:44:44.080]  bad for survival and then she goes I visited Tanzania with my boyfriend and
[01:44:44.080 --> 01:44:50.120]  we got he got robbed and killed but I hid and there it was right there she
[01:44:50.120 --> 01:44:54.520]  went to Tanzania to be a liberal trendy her boyfriend got murdered when she was
[01:44:54.520 --> 01:44:59.760]  there trying to help the Tanzanians and then she's still there henpecking the
[01:44:59.760 --> 01:45:04.840]  male guy and it's like every show I watch is just propaganda and of course why
[01:45:04.840 --> 01:45:09.600]  wasn't he armed in Tanzania why was the crime so high in Tanzania but one of the
[01:45:09.600 --> 01:45:12.440]  things that my mom taught me when I was young was to never run from your palms
[01:45:12.440 --> 01:45:15.120]  because they're gonna follow you I mean these people are running from their
[01:45:15.120 --> 01:45:17.960]  problems in Central America but guess what those problems are still gonna
[01:45:17.960 --> 01:45:20.960]  follow they're still gonna have issues they're gonna have to deal with there's
[01:45:20.960 --> 01:45:24.840]  no sense in running from your problems that's a week you stay there you fix
[01:45:24.840 --> 01:45:27.880]  your country where you're at and you get the liberty in place you get the
[01:45:27.880 --> 01:45:31.040]  freedom and you enjoy your life from there on running from it doesn't do
[01:45:31.040 --> 01:45:34.280]  anything all that does is make it worse for everyone who's still there it's a
[01:45:34.280 --> 01:45:38.000]  weak minded thinking I agree well please get on the phone with the Don
[01:45:38.000 --> 01:45:41.780]  Salazar we need to get an article out about the sheriff's thing is gonna
[01:45:41.780 --> 01:45:49.440]  arrest people you know you standoff high noon you know sheriff says the sheriff
[01:45:49.440 --> 01:45:54.200]  says he will arrest anti-open border demonstrators and then tomorrow is
[01:45:54.200 --> 01:45:57.640]  gonna get very heated or tonight whenever it happens but people here are
[01:45:57.640 --> 01:46:01.040]  ready for that because I heard the buses are coming tonight or will it be
[01:46:01.040 --> 01:46:04.120]  tomorrow I heard they're rolling them in a real late at night they might they
[01:46:04.120 --> 01:46:06.560]  might try to trick people because what they've been doing is coming in around
[01:46:06.560 --> 01:46:11.400]  10 11 a.m. but since they know that people are here ready on both sides is
[01:46:11.400 --> 01:46:15.360]  one there's only one way in it's from this side or right here it's just one
[01:46:15.360 --> 01:46:18.760]  street to get into this place so they're gonna have people protesters blocked on
[01:46:18.760 --> 01:46:22.920]  one side and on the other side as well so either way this community is gonna be
[01:46:22.920 --> 01:46:29.240]  ready to stop well I want you to go live on the you stream and things as soon as
[01:46:29.240 --> 01:46:34.480]  this happens and shoot HD you guys are doing just a fabulous job just take that
[01:46:34.480 --> 01:46:39.720]  place out stay there as much as you can with the team because this is
[01:46:39.720 --> 01:46:44.360]  happening at hundreds of places around the country McCallan you name it it's
[01:46:44.360 --> 01:46:48.400]  just in Marietta it's right on the edge of an affluent area the people are sick
[01:46:48.400 --> 01:46:53.120]  of it sick of paying for it they stood up that's the only reason this area is
[01:46:53.120 --> 01:46:58.720]  identified other people need to give us the human intelligence the humet to
[01:46:58.720 --> 01:47:03.480]  m4wars.com about where this is happening in other areas our problem is we
[01:47:03.480 --> 01:47:06.520]  don't have enough reporters to have it all covered that's why we need to be
[01:47:06.520 --> 01:47:10.160]  able to get the funds in to get even more great reporters like Jakari Jackson
[01:47:10.160 --> 01:47:14.680]  and Don Salazar and Joe Biggs and Kit Daniels and those that are with you but
[01:47:14.680 --> 01:47:20.120]  just have Kit follow more reports from his car or from the hotel but a lot
[01:47:20.120 --> 01:47:23.520]  happening we're gonna go to break and come back with Jakari Jackson's report
[01:47:23.520 --> 01:47:27.640]  Joe Biggs anything else from Marietta, California? I just want to say the true
[01:47:27.640 --> 01:47:30.600]  Americans stand up in the face of tyranny and we're seeing that happen
[01:47:30.600 --> 01:47:35.440]  everywhere and there are hundreds of folks from Marietta and I guess the most
[01:47:35.440 --> 01:47:41.800]  was like five or six guys and Brown Beret, Hispanic Cookless Clan outfits? Yeah
[01:47:41.800 --> 01:47:45.280]  I'm sure they'll try to come back tomorrow or tonight whenever it gets
[01:47:45.280 --> 01:47:49.120]  started getting heated up a lot of people start showing up around three
[01:47:49.120 --> 01:47:52.680]  four o'clock and to get off work today I think people are ignoring that and come
[01:47:52.680 --> 01:47:55.400]  a little bit early because they're excited for this they're ready to take
[01:47:55.400 --> 01:47:58.920]  it on. So more people are showing up as the sheriff says you'll arrest people?
[01:47:58.920 --> 01:48:03.960]  Yep. All right, thank you so much we'll come back from break there on the border
[01:48:03.960 --> 01:48:08.320]  in Marietta, California with Jakari Jackson to get his news on this
[01:48:08.320 --> 01:48:12.920]  he's got some other angles he's gonna cover as well by the way if you're a
[01:48:12.920 --> 01:48:17.760]  new listener I'm not joking where I'm from in the DFW area
[01:48:17.760 --> 01:48:26.320]  Grandbury, Texas. Biggs big city they have a judge going door-to-door you
[01:48:26.320 --> 01:48:30.320]  better not come out and protest or I'm gonna have you arrested just reminding
[01:48:30.320 --> 01:48:33.640]  you you're not in America just reminding you I want to work for Kim's young
[01:48:33.640 --> 01:48:38.960]  gun just reminding you I'm a sack of garbage this is just like with Obama in
[01:48:38.960 --> 01:48:42.640]  Missouri with the true squad saying we will arrest you if you say he's not a
[01:48:42.640 --> 01:48:46.440]  Christian and that he doesn't want to cut taxes for those making under a
[01:48:46.440 --> 01:48:51.760]  quarter million a year. I played that clip probably 20 times or more just type
[01:48:51.760 --> 01:48:58.920]  in Obama true squats it's in the Obama deception and this is nationwide now
[01:48:58.920 --> 01:49:03.960]  they go listen listen you sit in your house and you shut up you understand
[01:49:03.960 --> 01:49:07.640]  that we're importing the people that are gonna vote to make you our slaves
[01:49:07.640 --> 01:49:12.200]  because in a democracy we can vote to make you the slave do you understand
[01:49:12.200 --> 01:49:17.400]  that and they put it on TV with a straight face I mean my god channel 11
[01:49:17.400 --> 01:49:20.880]  in Dallas should be so embarrassed of themselves for reporting on this with a
[01:49:20.880 --> 01:49:25.720]  straight face here's the report as long as they make their statement and keeping
[01:49:25.720 --> 01:49:29.160]  with the law this is America and everybody's entitled to an opinion but
[01:49:29.160 --> 01:49:33.600]  if they break the law or impede the care of these children then we'll enforce the
[01:49:33.600 --> 01:49:39.680]  law children and then it goes on to say he's going door to door but again in
[01:49:39.680 --> 01:49:44.680]  that area they have ordinances where you can't sit on the side of the street with
[01:49:44.680 --> 01:49:48.960]  a sign anywhere but they let the tax day guy do it liberty tax and all that

[01:54:23.480 --> 01:54:28.520]  children have ducted and flown to America to have their organs removed I
[01:54:28.520 --> 01:54:32.560]  used to look into this about 15 years ago and didn't even believe it but it
[01:54:32.560 --> 01:54:39.400]  turns out in any war zone this goes on Iraq Israel look at what ended up
[01:54:39.400 --> 01:54:48.040]  happening in Egypt China it's pretty sick remember a few years ago Israel got
[01:54:48.040 --> 01:54:51.800]  real mad when a doctor said that was going on it was in Europe and then it
[01:54:51.800 --> 01:54:59.560]  turned out it was true I mean it's just incredibly evil this stuff goes on that's
[01:54:59.560 --> 01:55:04.480]  a story on info wars.com vials of smallpox virus found an unapproved
[01:55:04.480 --> 01:55:10.720]  Maryland Maryland lab autonomous Mercedes-Benz semi debuts on

[01:55:16.000 --> 01:55:20.760]  hedge article that's up on info wars.com is the Fed going to attempt a
[01:55:20.760 --> 01:55:25.240]  control collapse the Fed could be preparing to do exactly what it said
[01:55:25.240 --> 01:55:29.560]  it wouldn't that's what this is is a control collapse a slow-motion one
[01:55:29.560 --> 01:55:35.160]  that's what I've been saying since 2008 and most of our other analysts concur
[01:55:35.160 --> 01:55:39.320]  without analysis so that's all coming up but I do want to spend at least 10
[01:55:39.320 --> 01:55:41.920]  minutes later in the next hour we're gonna talk to Jakari Jackson the
[01:55:41.920 --> 01:55:46.360]  segment the next from Marietta, California reporting live on TV and radio
[01:55:46.360 --> 01:55:50.640]  right now I want to spend about 10 minutes looking at what Obama's done
[01:55:50.640 --> 01:55:57.400]  and comparing it to Nixon so that's coming up
[01:55:57.400 --> 01:56:02.240]  Jakari Jackson reporting from Marietta, California I know you've got a lot of
[01:56:02.240 --> 01:56:05.520]  breaking news give us your take on what you've been witnessing down there
[01:56:05.520 --> 01:56:10.000]  yeah this is Jakari Jackson info wars.com Marietta, California and we are
[01:56:10.000 --> 01:56:13.120]  once again outside the border patrol station and I want to point out to you
[01:56:13.120 --> 01:56:16.800]  Alex that the border patrol station fence has a better fence than the fence
[01:56:16.800 --> 01:56:20.680]  down on the actual border you can see it's a nice complete fence goes all the
[01:56:20.680 --> 01:56:24.240]  way around the structure but it's not anything like this if you actually go
[01:56:24.240 --> 01:56:27.720]  down to the border whether it's in California or anyplace else so we've
[01:56:27.720 --> 01:56:31.680]  been out here for the past couple days documenting talking to various residents
[01:56:31.680 --> 01:56:34.960]  we've been talking to people who say that you know this is not a racial issue
[01:56:34.960 --> 01:56:38.000]  at all even though they try to spin it that way in the media we've talked to
[01:56:38.000 --> 01:56:42.200]  people of a Mexican Native American descent we also talked to people who came
[01:56:42.200 --> 01:56:45.560]  here legally through the naturalization process a young lady we had a chance to
[01:56:45.560 --> 01:56:49.160]  talk to yesterday and she said it took her 15 years and several thousand
[01:56:49.160 --> 01:56:52.520]  dollars but she did it the legal lawful way and these are the stories that they
[01:56:52.520 --> 01:56:55.400]  don't want you to hear because when you see somebody like that you say well
[01:56:55.400 --> 01:56:58.840]  wow you can go through the naturalization process it may not be you
[01:56:58.840 --> 01:57:01.400]  know the greatest thing in the world but you know you do it the legal way you
[01:57:01.400 --> 01:57:04.200]  can get here but they don't want to show stories like that they just want to show
[01:57:04.200 --> 01:57:07.440]  you the pictures of the kids coming in on the buses and of course everybody is
[01:57:07.440 --> 01:57:11.000]  hard to believe for these kids but you know people have their own kids they
[01:57:11.000 --> 01:57:14.120]  have to take care of they can't pay through tax dollars to raise a myosas
[01:57:14.120 --> 01:57:17.480]  kid you know and we think about all the children being sent here if you do
[01:57:17.480 --> 01:57:20.920]  something like this Alex if you sent your kids to El Salvador on a greyhound
[01:57:20.920 --> 01:57:23.840]  bus and you'd probably have the CPS come knocking at you oh there's no
[01:57:23.840 --> 01:57:28.920]  probably I would be arrested for child endangerment and should I mean this is
[01:57:28.920 --> 01:57:34.040]  crazy town level and again it sets the precedent that there is no law the
[01:57:34.040 --> 01:57:38.520]  executive branch can decide where to even send the kids and they're deciding
[01:57:38.520 --> 01:57:42.760]  to dump them on Texas oh yeah the Texas California wherever else like I think
[01:57:42.760 --> 01:57:45.880]  big side a very good idea all these politicians who are out here saying that
[01:57:45.880 --> 01:57:48.440]  we need to have these kids come in why don't we send them to their house send
[01:57:48.440 --> 01:57:51.640]  them to the White House send them to below Pelosi's house send to whoever's
[01:57:51.640 --> 01:57:54.320]  house they're saying you know we want to take care of the kids you take care of
[01:57:54.320 --> 01:57:57.520]  the kids you go out there you feed them your clothing you make sure you know they
[01:57:57.520 --> 01:58:00.480]  go to school they brush their teeth you do all that stuff and let these people
[01:58:00.480 --> 01:58:04.440]  here take care of their own families jacari I want you to ask the locals and
[01:58:04.440 --> 01:58:08.600]  the police and others what do they think's gonna happen if all these
[01:58:08.600 --> 01:58:13.160]  people get legalized as 99% are according to the ICE memo it's gonna
[01:58:13.160 --> 01:58:17.560]  mean a much bigger wave how big do they think that wave is going to be because
[01:58:17.560 --> 01:58:22.120]  undoubtedly jacari this is the next big wave from the last wave I believe
[01:58:22.120 --> 01:58:26.120]  they're gonna get exponentially bigger how big do you think it's gonna get it's
[01:58:26.120 --> 01:58:29.280]  just gonna keep getting bigger and bigger because as you understand Alex you
[01:58:29.280 --> 01:58:32.320]  know when more people will hear about these situations like oh I can just go
[01:58:32.320 --> 01:58:35.240]  to America it's not just gonna be your central American just gonna be people
[01:58:35.240 --> 01:58:38.160]  from any country that's right stay there I'm coming right back to the car

[02:00:23.640 --> 02:00:45.400]  This is Jakarta Jackson reporting for info wars.com we're in Marietta, California
[02:00:45.400 --> 02:00:49.080]  myself and the rest the info wars crew and the interesting thing is this is
[02:00:49.080 --> 02:00:54.320]  about I guess 80 to 100 miles above the border so you have this facility here
[02:00:54.320 --> 02:00:57.600]  but they're not even so much checking for illegal immigration they're bringing
[02:00:57.600 --> 02:01:00.920]  the illegal immigrants here to be processed and we've been out here all
[02:01:00.920 --> 02:01:04.240]  day and the whole time we've been out here we've encountered one person one
[02:01:04.240 --> 02:01:09.400]  person who is pro-annesty a sweet little old lady who was just you know I guess
[02:01:09.400 --> 02:01:12.720]  slightly misguided so we'll show you what she had to say earlier today then
[02:01:12.720 --> 02:01:15.320]  we'll go over here and talk to these people who are against their country
[02:01:15.320 --> 02:01:19.520]  being overrun in their tax dollars spent housing illegal immigrants we have
[02:01:19.520 --> 02:01:23.400]  what's your name Georgia Johnson all right and tell me why it is you're out
[02:01:23.400 --> 02:01:26.880]  here what are you out here in support of I'm in support of treating the people
[02:01:26.880 --> 02:01:30.320]  that are coming across the border from the horrible situations that they're
[02:01:30.320 --> 02:01:35.160]  coming from I think we should treat them humanely treat them like the human
[02:01:35.160 --> 02:01:39.640]  beings that they are and show them that our country has compassion all right sir
[02:01:39.640 --> 02:01:43.800]  are you a resident of this county I am a city of Marietta County Riverside yes
[02:01:43.800 --> 02:01:47.320]  no I'm actually from oceanside okay and how far is that probably about an hour
[02:01:47.320 --> 02:01:50.320]  and a half away hour and a half away what's the biggest crowd you've seen out
[02:01:50.320 --> 02:01:59.760]  here so far probably 200 to 250 anti-Obama illegal immigration right yeah
[02:01:59.760 --> 02:02:04.680]  and then maybe 45 or 50 pro but we still have people in America who aren't
[02:02:04.680 --> 02:02:08.680]  getting taken care of vets or homeless they don't get a place to stay you know
[02:02:08.680 --> 02:02:12.240]  we're we're turning these military bases in the holding holding facilities
[02:02:12.240 --> 02:02:15.600]  for these children and I understand you know you want to help the kids that's
[02:02:15.600 --> 02:02:19.920]  fine but at the same time we have people here in America that need help you know
[02:02:19.920 --> 02:02:23.520]  imagine getting on a boat that says you can only hold 10 people and then you
[02:02:23.520 --> 02:02:29.160]  put 20 on there what's gonna happen it's gonna sink no this country is a
[02:02:29.160 --> 02:02:35.240]  wealthiest country in the world there's no reason for us to let anybody sink so
[02:02:35.240 --> 02:02:38.720]  what do you think about the secretary of Homeland Security J. Johnson saying that
[02:02:38.720 --> 02:02:42.640]  the people like you who have your viewpoint are pretty much a minority
[02:02:42.640 --> 02:02:45.840]  in this community I believe he's completely wrong I mean J. Johnson can't
[02:02:45.840 --> 02:02:49.040]  even answer questions I think he should be more focused on being able to answer
[02:02:49.040 --> 02:02:53.200]  reporters questions and what other what other Americans viewpoints are now he's
[02:02:53.200 --> 02:02:57.200]  completely out of touch he's in Washington DC probably had a real high
[02:02:57.200 --> 02:03:02.240]  fence with security guards and doesn't associate with a common man like me or
[02:03:02.240 --> 02:03:06.200]  the residents here in the city of Murrieta it's absolutely ridiculous I
[02:03:06.200 --> 02:03:10.040]  mean it's evident what he says doesn't match what's going on but there's a
[02:03:10.040 --> 02:03:13.200]  right way and there's a wrong way to go about the immigration process you don't
[02:03:13.200 --> 02:03:16.640]  think this is wrong in any way you know there's a lot of people who spend money
[02:03:16.640 --> 02:03:20.960]  who take the test to go through that process and you know you've got to
[02:03:20.960 --> 02:03:23.640]  understand that side of you as well though it's kind of a spit in the face of
[02:03:23.640 --> 02:03:26.800]  them they're going through the process the right way meanwhile these kids get
[02:03:26.800 --> 02:03:30.400]  shipped over and they're just giving everything right off the bat like I
[02:03:30.400 --> 02:03:33.520]  said there's veterans who don't get health care at all whatsoever but these
[02:03:33.520 --> 02:03:37.240]  kids are being given everything what are they being given what are the kids
[02:03:37.240 --> 02:03:43.000]  being given shelter food amnesty they're being dropped off in different places I
[02:03:43.000 --> 02:03:49.240]  mean they're as far as New York now amnesty they have to report to a court
[02:03:49.240 --> 02:03:53.560]  they have 90% of them don't even show up and this is recorded by the courts I
[02:03:53.560 --> 02:03:57.680]  have not heard that my wife actually just came across from Singapore she's a
[02:03:57.680 --> 02:04:01.640]  quadriplegic she um she has a broken neck she she um just became a legal
[02:04:01.640 --> 02:04:05.440]  migrant actually a week ago and she's completely outraged she can't believe
[02:04:05.440 --> 02:04:08.400]  this is happening all right miss can you tell me what your name is and what
[02:04:08.400 --> 02:04:12.440]  brought you out here today my name is Rena Raman and what brought me out here
[02:04:12.440 --> 02:04:18.880]  was actually the whole thing with the amnesty for illegal immigrants I'm an
[02:04:18.880 --> 02:04:23.920]  immigrant I just became a US citizen about a week and a half ago and I don't
[02:04:23.920 --> 02:04:28.120]  have any problems with immigration except that if it's illegal I don't think
[02:04:28.120 --> 02:04:33.040]  that we should be supporting it so that's my main beef I mean it took me
[02:04:33.040 --> 02:04:37.560]  about 15 years to become a citizen but I did it the legal way and a lot of money
[02:04:37.560 --> 02:04:45.560]  too so why are we doing this for people who are already breaking the law and why
[02:04:45.560 --> 02:04:50.400]  is the administration actually encouraging this it just seems all right
[02:04:50.400 --> 02:04:55.040]  undermining you can see that full report at info wars.com with Jakari

[02:08:33.920 --> 02:08:41.360]  jacarjax is reporting from Marietta, California and there's gonna probably
[02:08:41.360 --> 02:08:45.520]  some fireworks tonight or tomorrow because the sheriff has said that not
[02:08:45.520 --> 02:08:50.320]  just homeland security the Department of insecurity the Department of illegal
[02:08:50.320 --> 02:08:54.120]  immigrant importation has said anybody tries to block these buses busing these
[02:08:54.120 --> 02:08:59.200]  illegals in where they're then released and dumped off will be arrested and the
[02:08:59.200 --> 02:09:05.400]  folks are looking forward to that this is just pure madness then we've got a
[02:09:05.400 --> 02:09:12.360]  guest coming up dealing with the fact that in Canada and in Ireland and in all
[02:09:12.360 --> 02:09:18.280]  over the place they're finding giant caches of dead Native American babies
[02:09:18.280 --> 02:09:26.080]  dead Irish babies and this is in AFP it's in RT it's in some of the Canadian
[02:09:26.080 --> 02:09:28.960]  papers but not getting a lot of attention I interviewed the guest that's
[02:09:28.960 --> 02:09:32.160]  coming up probably six seven years ago before this even broke in the news and
[02:09:32.160 --> 02:09:37.680]  they were exposing it now they just like dug into a tunnel literally and
[02:09:37.680 --> 02:09:44.000]  figuratively and just found catacombs basically and the kids are being
[02:09:44.000 --> 02:09:49.560]  deliberately killed and you notice it's white kids it's native kids it's
[02:09:49.560 --> 02:09:56.640]  children you're seven to eight times more likely to be abused in the foster
[02:09:56.640 --> 02:10:01.200]  care system worldwide it's the same number in Russia as the US you can look
[02:10:01.200 --> 02:10:04.520]  up the just departments own numbers they've had the time magazine did a
[02:10:04.520 --> 02:10:07.320]  report that told the truth I couldn't believe it called the shame of foster
[02:10:07.320 --> 02:10:14.000]  care but their their solution was giving more money to it which then I mean
[02:10:14.000 --> 02:10:18.840]  that's putting fire on a fire it's putting logs on a fire gasoline on a
[02:10:18.840 --> 02:10:25.880]  fire fuel on a fire the system is fundamentally infested with mercenaries
[02:10:25.880 --> 02:10:31.280]  people that don't care and perverts it's the only place you can go to really
[02:10:31.280 --> 02:10:36.920]  abuse children and get away with it long term every major child system from the
[02:10:36.920 --> 02:10:44.360]  state of Texas and its commission they've founded to try to cover it up the
[02:10:44.360 --> 02:10:48.440]  Texas Youth Commission and all of its corruption to just anywhere you look
[02:10:48.440 --> 02:10:55.600]  it's hell level and nobody's gonna cry for those kids if the one they're
[02:10:55.600 --> 02:10:59.760]  having radiation tested on them or pesticides or just being strangled or
[02:10:59.760 --> 02:11:05.160]  being snuffed in a snuff film or being gutted for their organs when they're
[02:11:05.160 --> 02:11:08.720]  taken into the facility and put under and then have all their organs taken
[02:11:08.720 --> 02:11:12.960]  and that's in the news today as well we'll be talking about that at the bottom
[02:11:12.960 --> 02:11:19.320]  of the hour because Americans and others only get upset when the media says get
[02:11:19.320 --> 02:11:24.920]  upset for these poor Latin American babies who happen to be 14 or almost
[02:11:24.920 --> 02:11:34.200]  voting age and who's for the children let them all in but if it's a Ukrainian
[02:11:34.200 --> 02:11:37.760]  child being taken to have their organs harvested by NATO who runs most of the
[02:11:37.760 --> 02:11:41.160]  narcotics and white slavery out of Europe with the UN they've been caught
[02:11:41.160 --> 02:11:46.800]  literally hundreds of times nobody's gonna care and nobody's gonna care when
[02:11:46.800 --> 02:11:51.920]  they grab your kid out of the backyard and take him for harvesting either because
[02:11:51.920 --> 02:11:55.760]  Homeland Security runs the whole show
[02:11:55.760 --> 02:12:00.960]  worldwide they're gonna make sure that good people who are compartmentalized
[02:12:00.960 --> 02:12:05.320]  can never help your daughter or son because the whole system is built so
[02:12:05.320 --> 02:12:09.640]  the evil ones have omnipresent surveillance to carry out total crime
[02:12:09.640 --> 02:12:14.920]  because they like to do it and they're going to do it and you're going to
[02:12:14.920 --> 02:12:20.160]  thank them because you want to end up like those 53 million babies that were
[02:12:20.160 --> 02:12:25.600]  aborted because subconsciously you know you committed a crime all of us
[02:12:25.600 --> 02:12:30.360]  committed a crime against humanity and so you want to be hurt and you're going
[02:12:30.360 --> 02:12:34.520]  to be hurt they're going to be torn limb from limb like those children you're
[02:12:34.520 --> 02:12:41.760]  going to be chopped up and thrown into dumpster collectively very slowly though
[02:12:41.760 --> 02:12:47.840]  much more painfully and no one's gonna come to your aid and no one's gonna say
[02:12:47.840 --> 02:12:53.040]  you're human let's go back to Jacarie Jackson Jacarie Jackson you're there on
[02:12:53.040 --> 02:12:57.720]  the border in Marietta give us the waterfront what you witnessed in the
[02:12:57.720 --> 02:13:02.160]  two days you've been there yes we've been here for a few days we've talked
[02:13:02.160 --> 02:13:05.320]  about the people the reports you just played but we have some potentially
[02:13:05.320 --> 02:13:09.600]  breaking news Alex we were just told by some of the people out here the protesters
[02:13:09.600 --> 02:13:13.280]  that the police are now asking the property owners of this I guess this
[02:13:13.280 --> 02:13:17.560]  facility over here to move the people off of the property line so you can see
[02:13:17.560 --> 02:13:22.160]  the people packing up a little bit over here to the far side and so I guess
[02:13:22.160 --> 02:13:24.840]  they just don't want the people here and that's one of the gentlemen just came
[02:13:24.840 --> 02:13:27.880]  over to us and said one of the protesters he said we're not exactly sure
[02:13:27.880 --> 02:13:32.120]  where the property line is so we'll work to try to figure that out as it yeah it's
[02:13:32.120 --> 02:13:37.520]  total bull obviously there's right away always under state and federal law I
[02:13:37.520 --> 02:13:42.760]  would imagine it's probably 10 feet and you can probably see where that where
[02:13:42.760 --> 02:13:49.480]  that company's fence is who is it again I can't see the name of the company from
[02:13:49.480 --> 02:13:52.040]  where we are at the moment but the whole time we've been here we've seen police
[02:13:52.040 --> 02:13:55.720]  driving in and out I seriously doubt we can hit on the iPhone but I can see a
[02:13:55.720 --> 02:13:59.800]  patrol unit down there probably some type of SUV and some officers chatting down
[02:13:59.800 --> 02:14:02.880]  there and maybe those are the guys who well let's walk over there let's walk
[02:14:02.880 --> 02:14:06.440]  over there and I mean is that a warehouse or what is that I think that is
[02:14:06.440 --> 02:14:10.680]  some type of warehouse or processing facility they have a lot of those
[02:14:10.680 --> 02:14:15.560]  material trailers out here well what they've done is they've put orange cones
[02:14:15.560 --> 02:14:20.520]  up around the right-of-way and around the area you could use so it's all just
[02:14:20.520 --> 02:14:25.400]  more more playing games next I'll tell everybody to move off the other side if
[02:14:25.400 --> 02:14:29.520]  people put up with that we had the police in Virginia tell us we couldn't be on
[02:14:29.520 --> 02:14:32.520]  the sidewalk in front of Builder burger they'd arrest us and I just said go
[02:14:32.520 --> 02:14:36.400]  ahead and arrest me yeah well we've got some cars coming but I want to show we'll
[02:14:36.400 --> 02:14:39.200]  try to get down here in one second once these cars pass but there's some yellow
[02:14:39.200 --> 02:14:45.080]  barricades down this way and those weren't there yesterday so we'll we'll try
[02:14:45.080 --> 02:14:47.800]  to show all that here and just well yeah I mean they want to commit their crimes
[02:14:47.800 --> 02:14:52.360]  chippin in all these illegals to be put directly on the Democratic Party's
[02:14:52.360 --> 02:14:55.520]  giant floppy
[02:14:56.120 --> 02:15:02.520]  some trough yeah and I'm I mean this is just unbelievable I think Hillary
[02:15:02.520 --> 02:15:07.680]  Clinton ought to go down there herself and and and literally suckle all the
[02:15:07.680 --> 02:15:12.480]  children right so Alex the first day we came down here there was a news van and
[02:15:12.480 --> 02:15:16.880]  some other people down here but I want to show as we approach up here the the
[02:15:16.880 --> 02:15:20.600]  yellow barricades down here these weren't here yesterday as your car let me
[02:15:20.600 --> 02:15:23.440]  ask you a question aside as you before you get down there yeah we're doing a
[02:15:23.440 --> 02:15:26.000]  great job by the way that that report we just here was very powerful
[02:15:26.000 --> 02:15:30.400]  supplement for words dot com or 20 to 1 demonstrators against the open borders
[02:15:30.400 --> 02:15:34.960]  versus one pro illegal person just amazing you'd watch the media you would
[02:15:34.960 --> 02:15:41.360]  think it was the opposite but does Michelle Obama look normal to you I
[02:15:41.360 --> 02:15:45.080]  haven't seen her lately was there some new photo or a video of her well do you
[02:15:45.080 --> 02:15:49.640]  hear about Joan Rivers saying that she thinks she's a transvestite I've heard
[02:15:49.640 --> 02:15:55.520]  that I'm not really one I don't want to find out you don't see me don't see me
[02:15:55.520 --> 02:16:01.600]  to the White House on that one you don't want to investigate Michael Obama
[02:16:01.600 --> 02:16:05.720]  oh I'll pass on that that's Bradley Manning what's Bradley Manning's new
[02:16:05.720 --> 02:16:14.640]  name Chelsea yeah and that that was quite a shock to me but yeah I don't want
[02:16:14.640 --> 02:16:19.200]  I think I think Chelsea's actually pretty good looking we put Chelsea up on
[02:16:19.200 --> 02:16:23.960]  screen no no I'm gonna stop joking right there hey hey seriously jacari yeah we
[02:16:23.960 --> 02:16:30.480]  figured out who Michelle really is it's merman from the Legion of Doom Wow do
[02:16:30.480 --> 02:16:34.760]  that you do that uh that uh what's that guy's name the intro guy the narrator
[02:16:34.760 --> 02:16:39.040]  for super friends you know no one's heard me do my Ted Knight Voight the
[02:16:39.040 --> 02:16:45.160]  voice come on give us one give us one Aquaman summon three giant whales
[02:16:45.160 --> 02:16:49.600]  meanwhile at the Hall of Justice well super friends are meeting with Spider
[02:16:49.600 --> 02:16:56.840]  Man Batman and Aquaman all right and that's why I am an authority it's her
[02:16:56.840 --> 02:17:03.400]  yes there it is Michelle Obama oh my gosh oh it's from me man
[02:17:03.400 --> 02:17:09.640]  merman merman is from he man I'm totally wrong yeah and inspired a man's not in
[02:17:09.640 --> 02:17:13.480]  the DC universe well I'll let that one slide Alex but is that the interview
[02:17:13.480 --> 02:17:17.360]  where Joan Rivers walked out of CNN I saw that headline yeah well no no now
[02:17:17.360 --> 02:17:22.160]  they interviewed about that she walked out okay of course I think I think Joan
[02:17:22.160 --> 02:17:27.440]  Rivers may be a robot well she doesn't look like she had a few augmentations
[02:17:27.440 --> 02:17:33.120]  over the years you know the reason I say merman from the he-man castle of

[02:18:55.200 --> 02:18:58.880]  Alex sounds complete like a completely different person you know but that was
[02:18:58.880 --> 02:19:02.480]  before years of which one of you is the federal informant which one of you is
[02:19:02.480 --> 02:19:07.160]  the federal informant and all that great I think a cop's coming up behind you

[02:19:30.320 --> 02:19:34.240]  reports that they're asking the people to step off the property is that true I
[02:19:34.240 --> 02:19:39.520]  can't give any information right now I gotta go work on some other stuff if I
[02:19:39.520 --> 02:19:42.720]  can ask you unrelated question to this what kind of firearms do you have in

[02:19:47.920 --> 02:19:54.560]  yeah okay now let me do you have any concerns about the people out here are
[02:19:54.560 --> 02:19:58.280]  you gonna bring any riot police or any people to try to control the crowd if
[02:19:58.280 --> 02:20:01.920]  there's another crowd blocking the streets I can't answer that question but
[02:20:01.920 --> 02:20:05.640]  you can contact my our lieutenant John Flavin he's our PIO and you can ask
[02:20:05.640 --> 02:20:09.640]  him that question okay thank you man you're welcome all right police here is
[02:20:09.640 --> 02:20:13.800]  so nice you know it's it's not like some places I've been and you gotta fight
[02:20:13.800 --> 02:20:19.000]  with everybody but the car you also come off as the all-american that's why
[02:20:19.000 --> 02:20:22.680]  everybody's nice to you oh yeah well they're probably not nice to you cuz
[02:20:22.680 --> 02:20:27.320]  you yell at them now you're gonna be the new star of leave it to beaver yeah well
[02:20:27.320 --> 02:20:30.680]  you would this is pretty much the thing like we asked her you know if if it was
[02:20:30.680 --> 02:20:33.640]  true what they're asking the people to step off the property like we haven't
[02:20:33.640 --> 02:20:36.520]  had a chance to you know get over to where the main people are and talk to
[02:20:36.520 --> 02:20:40.200]  them personally but we do see in the distance people kind of packing up and
[02:20:40.200 --> 02:20:44.000]  moving off I guess the property line possibly we haven't had a chance to
[02:20:44.000 --> 02:20:48.780]  really looking to that's cuz we've been live on air meanwhile Aquaman battles
[02:20:48.780 --> 02:20:54.040]  the serpent I like you know Aquaman's kind of coming up in the years you know
[02:20:54.040 --> 02:20:59.200]  but he's still one of the weirdest superheroes out there I guess I can't do
[02:20:59.200 --> 02:21:02.240]  it as good as Ted Knight though yeah that's the guy from Caddyshack he also
[02:21:02.240 --> 02:21:06.000]  knows their voice on there is that a spalding is that the same guy is that a
[02:21:06.000 --> 02:21:12.600]  different guy meanwhile that's Luther in his underground base yeah a little bit
[02:21:12.600 --> 02:21:15.240]  of comic relief I don't know why I'm being so catty and goofy today I
[02:21:15.240 --> 02:21:19.200]  apologize getting serious here I'm about to get serious you're sorry anything
[02:21:19.200 --> 02:21:24.400]  else you'd like to add reporting from Southern California just we're

[02:21:36.200 --> 02:21:41.060]  family reunion and so he has to get there and meet him but my actual
[02:21:41.060 --> 02:21:45.160]  vacation will be later on this month I'm very much looking forward to that you
[02:21:45.160 --> 02:21:48.560]  didn't tell me you don't know where you're going yet oh well I think I'm
[02:21:48.560 --> 02:21:53.240]  gonna do a stay case so I mean I'll be in and around the Texas area maybe go
[02:21:53.240 --> 02:21:58.400]  visit my my siblings in that in that these city I'm not exactly fond of but I
[02:21:58.400 --> 02:22:01.880]  love the people there just not too fond of the city and do some other things as
[02:22:01.880 --> 02:22:06.480]  well oh my gosh you're gonna be vacationing in Dallas no no no that is
[02:22:06.480 --> 02:22:09.920]  classic oh I don't say I'm vacationing I don't go visit
[02:22:09.920 --> 02:22:15.560]  Chicago really doesn't like Dallas folks I you know I'm sure it many fine people
[02:22:15.560 --> 02:22:21.440]  there it's just not exactly for me I hear you you're from down you got fights
[02:22:21.440 --> 02:22:24.760]  all the time in Dallas you know what's going on down there yes I was totally
[02:22:24.760 --> 02:22:31.880]  awesome how many fights what did you get into in Dallas Alex none no it's all lies
[02:22:31.880 --> 02:22:39.400]  jacari no I had a completely uneventful life in fact this radio show is not
[02:22:39.400 --> 02:22:42.760]  happening this morning we talked about uneventful nothing is actually today's
[02:22:42.760 --> 02:22:47.280]  been pretty eventful but but but but nothing is going on there's nothing to
[02:22:47.280 --> 02:22:52.480]  see here these aren't the droids you're looking for move along okay that's that's
[02:22:52.480 --> 02:22:56.280]  the story I'm sure the mainstream will have a different spin on that but all
[02:22:56.280 --> 02:23:01.200]  right by the way what do you think's gonna happen tonight when Lord Obama visits
[02:23:01.200 --> 02:23:09.440]  with the Grand Dragon of the of Lorazza and Metia Robert Rodriguez yeah I heard
[02:23:09.440 --> 02:23:12.520]  about that I don't know if they're gonna hang out and watch machete or you know
[02:23:12.520 --> 02:23:17.120]  what exactly the plans are and also heard he was either Rick Perry invited
[02:23:17.120 --> 02:23:21.000]  him or Obama invited Rick Perry to have some type of meeting to talk about the
[02:23:21.000 --> 02:23:24.440]  situation they expect to happen in Dallas I've heard reports they want to
[02:23:24.440 --> 02:23:27.440]  bring the kids up there to those abandoned schools but you know Robert
[02:23:27.440 --> 02:23:31.000]  Rodriguez I used to like some of his movies back in the day I like Desperado
[02:23:31.000 --> 02:23:35.760]  and some of the earlier works but recent years he's kind of kind of gotten away
[02:23:35.760 --> 02:23:39.800]  from me but he does have a very nice studio I saw it in a DVD commentary one
[02:23:39.800 --> 02:23:46.040]  time yeah well I knew him I mean met him a few times and knew his wife but when I
[02:23:46.040 --> 02:23:50.640]  got the bad word I was out there at his studios he's basically taking them over
[02:23:50.640 --> 02:23:54.320]  at the time he was just in them out there at the old airport and I was hanging
[02:23:54.320 --> 02:24:00.720]  out with a crew consulting on a movie and Rodriguez his wife was out there
[02:24:00.720 --> 02:24:06.000]  before he divorced her did you just tell this story and yeah you know she goes
[02:24:06.000 --> 02:24:09.960]  yeah I've given him all the films but he doesn't like you because you're not
[02:24:09.960 --> 02:24:16.720]  down with the Raza and that was like in like in 2004 and I didn't know all that
[02:24:16.720 --> 02:24:20.800]  about him at the time and then he just went off the deep end and in my opinion
[02:24:20.800 --> 02:24:23.800]  Metsha and La Raza are the Hispanic Ku Klux Klan I know you talked a lot of
[02:24:23.800 --> 02:24:26.800]  Hispanic folks out there that said that's how they see it because that's
[02:24:26.800 --> 02:24:31.080]  what it is it's just it's mainline supported and he's like a kingpin of
[02:24:31.080 --> 02:24:37.200]  that now I mean he's like an El Hefe and that's what he runs here in Texas so
[02:24:37.200 --> 02:24:42.840]  he's kind of hung hanging up his directors I mean what I've heard from
[02:24:42.840 --> 02:24:45.440]  insiders is he's even talking about getting out of that he's just gonna run
[02:24:45.440 --> 02:24:50.300]  Democratic Party White House run race-based TV shows well that wouldn't
[02:24:50.300 --> 02:24:53.320]  make sense why he's hanging out with Obama then if that's that's what he's
[02:24:53.320 --> 02:24:57.920]  planning to do yeah I was told this by a director about two years ago and then
[02:24:57.920 --> 02:25:03.680]  I was told this by by an insider I'm not gonna say any more I mean somebody
[02:25:03.680 --> 02:25:08.840]  that's like right next to him and again this isn't a white versus black versus
[02:25:08.840 --> 02:25:13.600]  Hispanic thing no we were brought by Hispanic member of the crew who was
[02:25:13.600 --> 02:25:24.160]  senior the the machete first script and it was it was the script turned out it
[02:25:24.160 --> 02:25:27.040]  was a script Rodriguez went in the paper and said it wasn't the script when
[02:25:27.040 --> 02:25:31.240]  drugs and the national news picked it up and they cut out some of the race
[02:25:31.240 --> 02:25:35.120]  war stuff in it because of the protest but really us protesting it probably made
[02:25:35.120 --> 02:25:38.880]  the movie bigger I'm nothing against Robert Rodriguez it's just that he
[02:25:38.880 --> 02:25:43.320]  doesn't like me because I'm white and I happen to know the guy is like a crazy
[02:25:43.320 --> 02:25:52.200]  racist the guy's made hundreds of millions of dollars in America he get
[02:25:52.200 --> 02:25:55.720]  kidnapped and killed down in Mexico and the fact that he's dabbling with the
[02:25:55.720 --> 02:25:59.720]  Mexican mafia and stuff is very dangerous but what the word I've gotten is
[02:25:59.720 --> 02:26:03.560]  his elevator didn't go all the way to the top now and you know money destroys a
[02:26:03.560 --> 02:26:09.480]  lot of people bro yeah yeah yeah what is it they say like 95% of people that
[02:26:09.480 --> 02:26:14.760]  win a lottery are either dead in jail or bankrupt in like two years yeah that's
[02:26:14.760 --> 02:26:18.360]  exactly right that's exactly right it's a well when you get that sudden money or
[02:26:18.360 --> 02:26:22.120]  that sudden fame it really gets to people whether it's you know people I
[02:26:22.120 --> 02:26:25.680]  guess like Rodriguez or anybody else those lottery winners because our whole
[02:26:25.680 --> 02:26:29.400]  life changes or how people view them changed and it just becomes one big
[02:26:29.400 --> 02:26:34.200]  downward spiral for a lot of people well Quentin Tarantino I mean I don't like
[02:26:34.200 --> 02:26:42.280]  the Nazis but they put out that race porn then they put out and yeah that's
[02:26:42.280 --> 02:26:47.680]  the one that's really serious which is literally just meant to create false
[02:26:47.680 --> 02:26:52.280]  histories exaggerate open old wounds in my view and it's so funny to Quentin
[02:26:52.280 --> 02:26:59.440]  Tarantino who is again just in into racial stuff I mean I like pulp fiction
[02:26:59.440 --> 02:27:04.280]  but still it's it's shocking a lot of the stuff in it and they almost feel dirty
[02:27:04.280 --> 02:27:09.940]  after you watch it but then after that point it just becomes race porn is my
[02:27:09.940 --> 02:27:15.320]  view yeah what do you think I mean I've seen I've seen interviews with
[02:27:15.320 --> 02:27:19.320]  Tarantino and he likes using I guess those likes to hit on those racial
[02:27:19.320 --> 02:27:22.760]  themes a lot and I'm not exactly sure you know what brought him to that point
[02:27:22.760 --> 02:27:26.800]  but it's a race is a very big deal and pretty much all if not in most of not
[02:27:26.800 --> 02:27:31.920]  all of his films I don't maybe not so much in was it reservoir dogs I don't
[02:27:31.920 --> 02:27:36.280]  recall too much but no it raises an issue in his good films is my point mm-hmm
[02:27:36.280 --> 02:27:40.480]  and then that's all he does because Hollywood wants that it's part of the
[02:27:40.480 --> 02:27:44.840]  message as you see everywhere oh yeah they always want you to think about race
[02:27:44.840 --> 02:27:48.960]  because you think in the class or I'm being oppressed so this person's doing
[02:27:48.960 --> 02:27:52.640]  this to me instead of you know trying to just grow and achieve in your own right
[02:27:52.640 --> 02:27:56.520]  it's always this person is doing XYZ to me they want you to only think in a
[02:27:56.520 --> 02:28:00.520]  group so they can have leaders that control that group because if everybody
[02:28:00.520 --> 02:28:04.440]  goes off in their own direction it will organically be a free market of ideas
[02:28:04.440 --> 02:28:07.600]  and everybody will just come together anyways so in the name of political
[02:28:07.600 --> 02:28:10.880]  correctness it actually creates the division and they know full well what
[02:28:10.880 --> 02:28:15.760]  they're doing mm-hmm oh yeah you can see this all the time because we see it in
[02:28:15.760 --> 02:28:19.040]  the media you know whether some movies we already mentioned or the TV shows or
[02:28:19.040 --> 02:28:25.160]  you know video games whatever it might be it's it's plenty plenty out there well
[02:28:25.160 --> 02:28:27.800]  jacar I know you guys are gonna be covering that thank you for going out

[02:28:45.480 --> 02:28:49.200]  no idea what's going on around here well we we try to we try to keep the the

[02:33:32.960 --> 02:33:38.000]  dead babies some people believe they can cure disease because of its enormous
[02:33:38.000 --> 02:33:43.840]  popularity soil and green is in short supply remember Tuesday is soil and
[02:33:43.840 --> 02:33:49.480]  green the supply of soil and green has been exhausted you must evacuate the
[02:33:49.480 --> 02:33:58.720]  area that the shareholders of PepsiCo big builder bird group company are not
[02:33:58.720 --> 02:34:03.840]  allowed to know what they're using the baby parts for in the flavoring but we
[02:34:03.840 --> 02:34:08.680]  already know so enjoy the flavor we're going to get the real solution which is
[02:34:08.680 --> 02:34:11.720]  going to be a combination of death panels and and sales taxes I'm
[02:34:11.720 --> 02:34:16.200]  consistently pro-death I'm for assisted suicide I'm for regular
[02:34:16.200 --> 02:34:19.560]  zeroes and I'm for whatever gets the freeway moving is spending a million
[02:34:19.560 --> 02:34:23.640]  dollars on that last three months of life for that patient would it be better
[02:34:23.640 --> 02:34:29.960]  not to lay off the those 10 teachers and to make that trade-off in medical cost
[02:34:29.960 --> 02:34:33.560]  but that's called the death panel and you're not supposed to have that
[02:34:33.560 --> 02:34:39.600]  discussion they told me to to say that they were sorry but you had become
[02:34:39.600 --> 02:34:51.960]  unreliable is this the kind of society that you want to live in any kind of
[02:34:51.960 --> 02:34:55.360]  society that would do this to its children will do it to its senior
[02:34:55.360 --> 02:35:00.240]  citizens it will do it to its dissidents that kind of society will also
[02:35:00.240 --> 02:35:04.720]  eventually turn on its police on its army on its prison guards on the
[02:35:04.720 --> 02:35:09.760]  puzzlings and the collaborators who make that possible this is nothing but a
[02:35:09.760 --> 02:35:17.360]  suicide cult the scoops are on their way the scoops are on their way I repeat
[02:35:17.360 --> 02:35:23.120]  scoops are on their way you will find out why silent green means life you will
[02:35:23.120 --> 02:35:39.000]  find out why silent green means death we've got to stop them next thing they'll
[02:35:39.000 --> 02:35:45.560]  be breeding is like cattle for food you gotta tell them thank you Chuck
[02:35:45.560 --> 02:35:49.880]  has been that's from silent green little piece of derrim it green put
[02:35:49.880 --> 02:35:53.440]  together when we talk about dehumanization using babies to eat
[02:35:53.440 --> 02:35:58.560]  hospitals around the world teaching us that humans have no value this is the
[02:35:58.560 --> 02:36:05.200]  culture of death and if you look at the Nazi orphanages if you look at the
[02:36:05.200 --> 02:36:10.000]  Soviet orphanages the Chinese orphanages the South Korean the North Korean
[02:36:10.000 --> 02:36:14.680]  orphanages the African orphanages the Latin American orphanages the US
[02:36:14.680 --> 02:36:20.640]  orphanages the Mexican orphanages it's just literal hell on earth children
[02:36:20.640 --> 02:36:26.640]  being abused in the worst conditions you can imagine and then if you spank your
[02:36:26.640 --> 02:36:29.840]  kid even though it's not against the law they take your kid throw them in one of
[02:36:29.840 --> 02:36:32.840]  these things they're in these foster homes and I'm not saying all foster
[02:36:32.840 --> 02:36:39.080]  parents are bad it on average is better than a big orphanage system but what you
[02:36:39.080 --> 02:36:42.480]  see at places like Penn State is only the tip of the iceberg and of course it
[02:36:42.480 --> 02:36:46.480]  came out it was university-wide he was raping children in broad daylight at
[02:36:46.480 --> 02:36:51.000]  noon in the middle of the week in the showers that's busier than a four-way
[02:36:51.000 --> 02:36:58.040]  stop in a major city you know a football fieldhouse because for these sickos
[02:36:58.040 --> 02:37:02.440]  they want to do it out in the open that's what psychopaths control freaks
[02:37:02.440 --> 02:37:09.040]  and sadists do they get off on it being out in the open
[02:37:09.040 --> 02:37:13.960]  flaunting shutting down our power plants flaunting shipping guns to Mexico to
[02:37:13.960 --> 02:37:19.360]  blame the Second Amendment flaunting the 130,000 dead in Mexico mass graves
[02:37:19.360 --> 02:37:25.880]  found everywhere 99% killed by Mexican on Mexican drug cartel stuff men women
[02:37:25.880 --> 02:37:29.280]  and children dead and then Roger Rodriguez shows Don Johnson shooting
[02:37:29.280 --> 02:37:33.120]  pregnant Mexican women in the stomach with a rifle and everybody then blames
[02:37:33.120 --> 02:37:40.000]  that on white people so that's how this works ladies and gentlemen and there's
[02:37:40.000 --> 02:37:45.840]  a Tony Cartelucci article about the reports coming out in Ukraine about
[02:37:45.840 --> 02:37:51.680]  harvesting of children's organs and you know about five years ago during the
[02:37:51.680 --> 02:37:57.840]  whole Gaza thing I saw reports in major German newspapers about Israeli doctors
[02:37:57.840 --> 02:38:01.920]  shooting Palestinian kids and then keeping them alive to take their organs
[02:38:01.920 --> 02:38:08.680]  I didn't believe it and then it came down it was true and then you learn
[02:38:08.680 --> 02:38:12.960]  basically any war zone this is going on because it's not the US army or the
[02:38:12.960 --> 02:38:17.400]  Israeli army or even NATO you know the head of Interpol says arm the general
[02:38:17.400 --> 02:38:24.560]  public probably a good guy but it's compartments so when you have a war it's
[02:38:24.560 --> 02:38:28.800]  trillions of no bid contracts that have been spent in Iraq and Afghanistan and
[02:38:28.800 --> 02:38:32.520]  it's the contractors and I might even say on all of them it's the special
[02:38:32.520 --> 02:38:37.680]  contractor groups the diplomatic community UN teams and you see this with
[02:38:37.680 --> 02:38:40.960]  the UN sex scandals everywhere they go and little kids being loaded on planes
[02:38:40.960 --> 02:38:49.160]  to be flown to Saudi Arabia and Asia and you learn every government's involved
[02:38:49.160 --> 02:38:55.720]  in every major government in snuff films and trafficking and I mean it is so
[02:38:55.720 --> 02:39:01.320]  hellish that no one can stop it because no one wants to admit it it's like when
[02:39:01.320 --> 02:39:04.960]  a former Congresswoman said the McKinney asked the head of the Pentagon
[02:39:04.960 --> 02:39:09.680]  Rumsfeld this famous video online I've been Rumsfeld grilled by McKinney it'll
[02:39:09.680 --> 02:39:14.480]  come up and she says what do you want to say about the UN and Dincor kidnapping
[02:39:14.480 --> 02:39:19.120]  little boys and girls and flying them out to secret locations he said well we
[02:39:19.120 --> 02:39:22.840]  put them in the penalty box and find them then she pulls up the document you
[02:39:22.840 --> 02:39:31.720]  didn't even find them you learn Dincor runs the private CPS in most states now
[02:39:31.720 --> 02:39:35.440]  if you're wealthy or middle class and know what to do you can get the lawyers
[02:39:35.440 --> 02:39:39.320]  get whatever and stop this there's private groups you know divorces you name
[02:39:39.320 --> 02:39:46.160]  it the general public doesn't get that and so the reason I raise all this is a
[02:39:46.160 --> 02:39:52.560]  backdrop is this is all going on but people don't know it just like the new
[02:39:52.560 --> 02:39:56.320]  numbers are a half a million people they believe are dying of flesh-eating
[02:39:56.320 --> 02:40:00.000]  bacteria or drug-resistant bugs in the U.S. alone it's probably the number one
[02:40:00.000 --> 02:40:03.840]  cause of death now if you've had all the numbers together it's probably more than
[02:40:03.840 --> 02:40:07.480]  a half million you hardly hear about it or if you do it's not an issue it's
[02:40:07.480 --> 02:40:10.800]  killing members of my family left and right everybody I know people are dying
[02:40:10.800 --> 02:40:17.160]  okay I mean it's devastating you're not gonna hear about it it's but people
[02:40:17.160 --> 02:40:20.280]  think they can't swim because they think great white sharks are gonna get
[02:40:20.280 --> 02:40:24.840]  them I use analogy a thousand times since jaws happen revenue at beach
[02:40:24.840 --> 02:40:31.120]  communities in the United States have gone way down since 1972 and they
[02:40:31.120 --> 02:40:35.280]  directly know it's because of a movie it's the same deal terrorism isn't real
[02:40:35.280 --> 02:40:38.680]  here domestically it's manufactured racism is super rare compared to what
[02:40:38.680 --> 02:40:41.960]  they said there's all this imaginary stuff we're worried about well meanwhile
[02:40:41.960 --> 02:40:45.560]  they're just scooping our kids up everywhere and in England it's epidemic
[02:40:45.560 --> 02:40:49.720]  where the kids just disappear Americans that visit England now I know some of
[02:40:49.720 --> 02:40:56.240]  them they just grab your kids for no reason they come to the door someone
[02:40:56.240 --> 02:40:58.800]  said they saw you spank your child in the lobby we're taking him into custody
[02:40:58.800 --> 02:41:03.680]  we're deporting you your kids name is changed you never see him they get dug
[02:41:03.680 --> 02:41:11.120]  up as a skeleton at the Royal Palace literally latest headline powerful
[02:41:11.120 --> 02:41:15.920]  elite of at least 20 establishment figures may have been part of pedophile
[02:41:15.920 --> 02:41:20.920]  ring that abused children for decades and see because the elite are into that
[02:41:20.920 --> 02:41:26.320]  they can burn any of themselves anytime they want I'm digressing but I want to
[02:41:26.320 --> 02:41:32.560]  explain something the elite want global control to abuse children now you can
[02:41:32.560 --> 02:41:36.920]  believe David Ike that they're possessed by blood drinking aliens doesn't matter
[02:41:36.920 --> 02:41:40.080]  they might as well be blood drinking aliens you can believe the Bible they're
[02:41:40.080 --> 02:41:42.680]  possessed by demons if that's not true doesn't matter
[02:41:42.680 --> 02:41:47.680]  archetypally they are demons it's real no matter what angle you see it we're
[02:41:47.680 --> 02:41:52.680]  faced with an army of pure evil and I get psyched up and get wilder on air
[02:41:52.680 --> 02:41:57.000]  because I realize it I'm a very sensitive person folks and I've
[02:41:57.000 --> 02:42:00.800]  intellectually studied them but I can spiritually feel them and it's I don't
[02:42:00.800 --> 02:42:05.120]  like having to focus on them but you know what we've gotten to this point
[02:42:05.120 --> 02:42:09.600]  because we've ignored it now here's some headlines from just this week an Irish
[02:42:09.600 --> 02:42:14.160]  Catholic orphanage hid the bodies of 800 children found buried in a mass grave
[02:42:14.160 --> 02:42:18.960]  in a septic tank and that was really just a state-run institution and they
[02:42:18.960 --> 02:42:21.800]  just call it a Catholic orphanage I'm not Catholic I'm not even defending it
[02:42:21.800 --> 02:42:26.760]  but these are like political cutouts organ harvesting in Ukraine goes
[02:42:26.760 --> 02:42:32.000]  unreported that's how to salon the article on the bond the dead becids
[02:42:32.000 --> 02:42:38.000]  here's our team mass baby grave scandal pushes Irish government Catholic church
[02:42:38.000 --> 02:42:44.360]  towards inquiry and again folks they were killing the little children in secret
[02:42:44.360 --> 02:42:49.920]  bio test is what's come out and then putting them into a giant vat of human
[02:42:49.920 --> 02:42:56.280]  crack can't make how satanic is that murdered little children with bio weapons
[02:42:56.280 --> 02:43:00.640]  testing them like Dr. Mingala and then inserting them into a huge septic tank
[02:43:00.640 --> 02:43:06.240]  almost 800 babies buried in septic tank there you go headline so that's some of
[02:43:06.240 --> 02:43:10.440]  it now shifting gears to our next guess it was almost like seven years ago when
[02:43:10.440 --> 02:43:14.840]  I saw it I already heard of him but then I saw it in the Toronto star some of it
[02:43:14.840 --> 02:43:18.480]  was confirmed I had him on Moore's been confirmed since then I appreciate him
[02:43:18.480 --> 02:43:21.920]  coming on during a heavy news day we pushed him back some we're having back
[02:43:21.920 --> 02:43:28.600]  on again soon 28 mass graves of Indian children in Canada discovered daily cost
[02:43:28.600 --> 02:43:34.440]  picked us up in 2008 was being reported by the local news channels there and
[02:43:34.440 --> 02:43:41.720]  again it ties in to the British government yet again and joining us on the
[02:43:41.720 --> 02:43:45.600]  show is Kevin Annette hope I'm pronouncing that right he's been on
[02:43:45.600 --> 02:43:54.000]  before we appreciate you coming on it ccs.org it ccs.org and maybe Nancy
[02:43:54.000 --> 02:43:57.480]  Pelosi you can come pick some of those kids up and keep them at her house a
[02:43:57.480 --> 02:44:00.600]  little skeletons because you know she says she wants to take the illegals
[02:44:00.600 --> 02:44:04.000]  whether but doesn't really take them it's all talking Clinton keeps half the
[02:44:04.000 --> 02:44:07.720]  money for the African kids and the Haitian kids for himself to buy jets
[02:44:07.720 --> 02:44:11.840]  with but nobody criticizes him for that well an inquiry is now starting as
[02:44:11.840 --> 02:44:16.560]  folks have been but sure thank you so much for your titles worked last decade
[02:44:16.560 --> 02:44:22.320]  to expose this tell us the latest and how this ties into what I see as the
[02:44:22.320 --> 02:44:28.280]  whatever's running it governments are obsessed with annihilating small
[02:44:28.280 --> 02:44:35.640]  children that's Alex thanks for me on the test to do with the second realm of
[02:44:35.640 --> 02:44:39.120]  law trials happening in Brussels the first one is when we convicted Joseph
[02:44:39.120 --> 02:44:44.080]  Routesinger Pope Benedict in 2013 the second round of trials has to do with
[02:44:44.080 --> 02:44:49.160]  global child trafficking and the present Pope Jorge Bogoglio is named as a
[02:44:49.160 --> 02:44:54.400]  primary defendant because he was doing it both in Argentina and today what we
[02:44:54.400 --> 02:44:57.920]  found in the course of four orders coming forward is there's a thing called
[02:44:57.920 --> 02:45:01.480]  the ninth circle it's a sacrificial cult that operates with Catholic church
[02:45:01.480 --> 02:45:05.400]  sanctioned it has for actually over two centuries according to some Vatican
[02:45:05.400 --> 02:45:10.440]  documents that have been given to the court and this rituals they operate all
[02:45:10.440 --> 02:45:14.480]  through Europe and North America with a lot of police and army protection we
[02:45:14.480 --> 02:45:20.200]  have now links as well to Ireland the the Osnagarta and the Irish police
[02:45:20.200 --> 02:45:26.360]  informed us the 800 babies bodies that you mentioned were actually signs of
[02:45:26.360 --> 02:45:30.960]  decapitation and dismemberment which are classic as a tenant you know
[02:45:30.960 --> 02:45:36.840]  sacrificial symptoms and so you know it's all beginning to come together into
[02:45:36.840 --> 02:45:40.840]  a global network that's involving once again these people fairly high up in
[02:45:40.840 --> 02:45:46.760]  the in the Vatican and the crown of England well this is just amazing and
[02:45:46.760 --> 02:45:49.760]  again today we got short on time I don't want to shortchange you I want to
[02:45:49.760 --> 02:45:53.760]  reschedule a full hour with you and you can send us all the exhibits and I can
[02:45:53.760 --> 02:45:58.000]  properly get briefed on all the latest stuff that's happened to do justice to
[02:45:58.000 --> 02:46:02.480]  this it's just that so many times I remember what you were saying you know
[02:46:02.480 --> 02:46:06.560]  eight nine years ago and and then a lot of it came out in the newspapers and it
[02:46:06.560 --> 02:46:10.320]  just gets worse and worse and you're now saying via your lawsuits and things
[02:46:10.320 --> 02:46:15.120]  you've gotten documents from where I've never heard of a secret society called
[02:46:15.120 --> 02:46:19.920]  the ninth circle I know there's Dante's Inferno and and the ninth circle of
[02:46:19.920 --> 02:46:24.480]  hell but but I mean that is just I mean there's a lot of cults within
[02:46:24.480 --> 02:46:28.840]  organizations tell us about the ninth circle well these are referred to not
[02:46:28.840 --> 02:46:34.040]  only by witnesses who are participants and you know people who have been raised
[02:46:34.040 --> 02:46:40.920]  in the cult but also a document released in the last month to the court this was
[02:46:40.920 --> 02:46:44.040]  from a Vatican and cited the document was in Latin and it was in the secret
[02:46:44.040 --> 02:46:48.680]  archives the same archives that contain the policy called crimson solicit anis
[02:46:48.680 --> 02:46:54.320]  which requires priests to cover up child rape it was in the same archive and it
[02:46:54.320 --> 02:46:58.480]  it makes reference to this ninth circle going as far back as the 1700s and
[02:46:58.480 --> 02:47:05.360]  definitely tied in to you know various popes at that time now these have been
[02:47:05.360 --> 02:47:09.920]  confirmed by fairly top-level sources within the church who have come
[02:47:09.920 --> 02:47:13.800]  forward now because there's a factional struggle breaking out within the
[02:47:13.800 --> 02:47:18.280]  Vatican you've noticed that this present pope has canceled three speaking
[02:47:18.280 --> 02:47:21.480]  engagements and has talked about health concerns that he's probably being forced
[02:47:21.480 --> 02:47:24.400]  out as well because rat singers very much still holding the reins of power
[02:47:24.400 --> 02:47:30.600]  there according to these Roman sources so it's all connected to that and like any
[02:47:30.600 --> 02:47:35.160]  secret society these things are very well hidden but the point is insiders are
[02:47:35.160 --> 02:47:38.800]  now beginning to speak and just as in the case that where we prove genocide in
[02:47:38.800 --> 02:47:43.520]  Canada that's now beginning to happen you know on a more global level now and
[02:47:43.520 --> 02:47:47.320]  again the reason for my research that Satanism keeps popping up in orphanages
[02:47:47.320 --> 02:47:52.280]  of every stripe around the world is where do you think Satanist pedophiles
[02:47:52.280 --> 02:47:56.160]  sickos are going to go they're going to go where they have institutional
[02:47:56.160 --> 02:48:01.760]  protection to engage in these crimes they start the crimes slow get the local
[02:48:01.760 --> 02:48:06.960]  and stabulari to be part of the cover-up once they're compromised it goes full
[02:48:06.960 --> 02:48:11.800]  eyes wide shut and I mean look at what's come out with a surveil in England and
[02:48:11.800 --> 02:48:18.920]  the Royals I remember when you were on correct my memory but 2007 2008 you were
[02:48:18.920 --> 02:48:23.200]  bringing up the fact of British royalty you believe was tied into this and did
[02:48:23.200 --> 02:48:27.880]  make visits to some of these mass grave areas we had an eyewitness who saw
[02:48:27.880 --> 02:48:32.040]  Queen Elizabeth and Prince Philip take 10 children from the Kamloops Indian
[02:48:32.040 --> 02:48:36.920]  School in British Columbia in 1964 and these 10 children were never seen again
[02:48:36.920 --> 02:48:40.800]  William Coombs was his name he was to come to London to testify but then he
[02:48:40.800 --> 02:48:45.240]  died very suddenly in a hospital after apparently receiving lethal injection
[02:48:45.240 --> 02:48:51.400]  that was in February 2011 but you know this is ongoing we've had six people
[02:48:51.400 --> 02:48:54.480]  within our network killed in this manner Aboriginal people because they start
[02:48:54.480 --> 02:48:58.160]  naming the names of these you know very high-up people who come to these places
[02:48:58.160 --> 02:49:03.040]  for kids well I mean expanding on this well some of this has come out in the
[02:49:03.040 --> 02:49:06.080]  in the Canadian papers and the mass graves have been dug up at these
[02:49:06.080 --> 02:49:09.560]  orphanages and then they just keep finding more I mean that's been in the
[02:49:09.560 --> 02:49:14.440]  news but when you look at all this where what do you think of hundreds of
[02:49:14.440 --> 02:49:18.440]  thousands of undocumented kids they won't let congressmen into the facilities
[02:49:18.440 --> 02:49:23.600]  and they're being disappeared on buses I mean that's illegal under all the child
[02:49:23.600 --> 02:49:28.680]  laws anyways but a lot of them they admit have been mules from your deep
[02:49:28.680 --> 02:49:32.200]  research into this what do you think I mean does it concern you that hundreds
[02:49:32.200 --> 02:49:37.520]  of thousands of kids are disappearing into bizarre secret federal networks well
[02:49:37.520 --> 02:49:41.640]  yeah I mean of course it's it's the more and more what we do now that we have
[02:49:41.640 --> 02:49:45.400]  these common law courts established for a due to came in this matters you can't
[02:49:45.400 --> 02:49:49.040]  rely on any aspect of the system because child trafficking is enormous it
[02:49:49.040 --> 02:49:52.960]  operates in every institution especially in the so-called child welfare system as
[02:49:52.960 --> 02:49:57.400]  you were mentioning earlier and so you you have to set up a parallel way to
[02:49:57.400 --> 02:50:01.720]  investigate and to bring these things to to courts that are not controlled by the
[02:50:01.720 --> 02:50:05.440]  Cabell which all of these clearly are I mean it's been my experience over 20
[02:50:05.440 --> 02:50:09.520]  years now that any aspect of the system you try to work through you compromise
[02:50:09.520 --> 02:50:12.920]  your research because it's immediately shut down we've had that experience time
[02:50:12.920 --> 02:50:18.720]  again in Canada well all I know is I mean if you look at the British papers
[02:50:18.720 --> 02:50:23.320]  this is all coming out there satanism killing children raping them secret
[02:50:23.320 --> 02:50:29.280]  rooms and one article said 40 members of parliament last week I saw have been
[02:50:29.280 --> 02:50:32.440]  implicated but the police can't get them because it'll bring the whole
[02:50:32.440 --> 02:50:36.280]  government down because they're obviously involved you know what I want to do I

[02:58:43.320 --> 02:58:47.840]  other news coming up in our overdrive I'm Al Scherz
[02:58:48.920 --> 02:58:54.320]  from the water table to our soils to the atmosphere itself our world is
[02:58:54.320 --> 02:58:57.840]  becoming more and more toxic each and every day but it's not just the air
[02:58:57.840 --> 02:59:01.880]  outside that's toxic indoor air has been shown to have two to five times higher
[02:59:01.880 --> 02:59:06.080]  concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor air and most Americans spend 90
[02:59:06.080 --> 02:59:09.920]  percent of their time inside using toxic chemicals within their homes there are
[02:59:09.920 --> 02:59:14.080]  more than 42 million smokers in the United States well over a thousand
[02:59:14.080 --> 02:59:17.880]  types of mold in mildew linked to numerous conditions and don't forget the
[02:59:17.880 --> 02:59:21.240]  fact that six million Americans live with pets they're allergic to as well

[03:02:59.680 --> 03:03:04.520]  dictator to wreck the country and burn it down this is bigger than politics
