[00:00.000 --> 00:11.880]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does
[00:11.880 --> 00:26.440]  he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:26.440 --> 00:32.380]  Well a senior Obama official says, quote, we're gonna kill the dollar. And CBS News
[00:32.380 --> 00:37.440]  with a straight face has pundits on saying, it's time to scrap the Constitution. Quote,
[00:37.440 --> 00:42.640]  let's give up on the Constitution as if it caused all the problems when we've been completely
[00:42.640 --> 00:45.040]  allowing criminals to ignore it.
[00:45.040 --> 00:52.040]  Welcome ladies and gentlemen, it is Monday, the 28th day of January 2013. And we don't
[00:52.040 --> 00:58.560]  have any guests today, because I want to take your phone calls on all the things that we
[00:58.560 --> 01:03.480]  see happening in this world. The incredible acceleration of tyranny. We'll get the number
[01:03.480 --> 01:08.400]  out coming up in the next segment and just cover a ton of news.
[01:08.400 --> 01:12.600]  Obama's meeting with police chiefs that are anti-gun and basically on the federal payroll
[01:12.600 --> 01:19.040]  today. Acting like police wanna take the public's guns when national surveys show that
[01:19.040 --> 01:23.420]  they can pull these up. Over 90% of sheriff's departments and police departments are actually
[01:23.420 --> 01:24.800]  pro-gun.
[01:24.800 --> 01:28.000]  Because despite the fact that they're getting federal funds to say that the opposite, they
[01:28.000 --> 01:31.960]  know guns frustrate crime many more times than they actually are used in the commission
[01:31.960 --> 01:40.400]  of crimes. They know the FBI's own statistics garnered and the standard of good statistics.
[01:40.400 --> 01:47.320]  That crime's gone down 49% in the last 20 years, 21% just since 2007. So it's accelerating.
[01:47.320 --> 01:52.540]  They know that. And that's why you see this all out attack on the Second Amendment is
[01:52.540 --> 01:55.440]  because the gun culture is gonna kill the tyranny culture.
[01:55.440 --> 02:06.740]  It's like it killed the tyranny culture in 1775, 1776, 1777, 78, 79, 80, 81. Now, I've
[02:06.740 --> 02:10.640]  really done some deep thinking and a lot of what I'm gonna say today I've already said,
[02:10.640 --> 02:16.200]  but I'm gonna try to say it as clearly as I possibly can. My great frustration is I'll
[02:16.200 --> 02:23.920]  be sitting there making my children eggs or I'll be walking the dogs or carrying the laundry
[02:23.920 --> 02:29.400]  in the laundry room and I'll just have these clear, concise points I wanna make.
[02:29.400 --> 02:34.640]  And then by the time I get here to the radio and engage in management on a half dozen issues
[02:34.640 --> 02:40.260]  and scan back over another 20, 30, 40 articles and watch video clips, I get in here and my
[02:40.260 --> 02:46.140]  head's spinning. But I am gonna attempt to just basically break down what we're facing
[02:46.140 --> 02:51.500]  as a society and take your phone calls.
[02:51.500 --> 03:00.100]  We got a call yesterday about hacked emails out of a big British defense contractor. Paul
[03:00.100 --> 03:04.920]  Watson's gone over the cash and it's scans of passports, you name it. There's thousands
[03:04.920 --> 03:10.360]  of pages. If it is a hoax, it's an elaborate hoax. Watson, who's got a pretty good nose
[03:10.360 --> 03:13.240]  for these things, thinks it's real.
[03:13.240 --> 03:18.340]  At least most of it, they also mix garbage in. And the reason I think it has credibility
[03:18.340 --> 03:22.720]  is it dovetails with something we've been covering for a year intensely the last six
[03:22.720 --> 03:28.360]  months with our contacts like Syrian Girl and others. And of course, Israel said yesterday
[03:28.360 --> 03:32.880]  they're preparing to strike Syria. They believe any of the rebels, including Western backed
[03:32.880 --> 03:36.960]  rebels, they're calling the government rebels and the West rebels rebels.
[03:36.960 --> 03:42.600]  If any of them get the chemical weapons of Syria that are guarded by Russia, that they're
[03:42.600 --> 03:47.600]  going to use that as a pretext to attack the country. And hacked emails reveal Washington
[03:47.600 --> 03:53.920]  approved plan to stage chemical weapons attack in Syria. We've actually seen al-Qaeda rebels
[03:53.920 --> 04:03.520]  arrogant enough to shoot videos where they're testing sarin. Thank God they don't have VX.
[04:03.520 --> 04:07.880]  Sarin's bad enough though. One whiff of that, you're dead. They send that up an assessment,
[04:07.880 --> 04:18.360]  spray that over a city. Tens of thousands dead, bare minimum. And these are the historical
[04:18.360 --> 04:22.420]  times where all the battle lines are drawn.
[04:22.420 --> 04:25.960]  And when you see a World War I, World War II type event happening, and that's what all
[04:25.960 --> 04:31.400]  the think tanks are saying. The CFR, others are saying get ready for World War III. I'm
[04:31.400 --> 04:35.760]  not saying that, I'm reporting on what they're saying. And there's already just, I don't
[04:35.760 --> 04:41.040]  know, five, six different nations in war in Africa with the West starting that.
[04:41.040 --> 04:45.840]  Multiple Middle Eastern nations, just all sorts of craziness going on. We're on the
[04:45.840 --> 04:52.600]  edge of some very serious things accelerating. So that's all coming up and they're getting
[04:52.600 --> 04:56.900]  ready to legalize all the illegal aliens. Republicans are telling us this is the time
[04:56.900 --> 05:01.000]  to submit to the new world order.
[05:01.000 --> 05:05.720]  Now that we have moved into the winter season, there is an increased need to support our
[05:05.720 --> 05:11.320]  immunity and health. At Silver Lungs, we are committed to meeting your needs by providing

[06:05.060 --> 06:09.640]  like Hurricane Sandy and the devastating summer drought to the family hardships brought on
[06:09.640 --> 06:14.740]  by a disastrous economy? Our hearts go out to those that have lost everything. At eFoods

[06:29.040 --> 06:33.800]  to be able to help my sister and niece. It is better to be prepared 10 years too early

[06:59.760 --> 07:05.080]  Alex Jones here with a message to fellow freedom lovers. The prognosis for the entire planetary
[07:05.080 --> 07:10.760]  economic system runs from bad to worse. The globalist model is to shut down societies
[07:10.760 --> 07:15.920]  and starve patriots out until they acquiesce to the global takeover. That's why we've assembled
[07:15.920 --> 07:21.460]  the most vital and important preparedness items at infowarshop.com. These are items
[07:21.460 --> 07:26.880]  that I did research on that I personally use. You've got the LifeStraw so you can turn

[08:03.840 --> 08:16.280]  Defending the Republic from enemies born and domestic. It's Alex Jones. It is Monday my
[08:16.280 --> 08:24.800]  friends the 28th day of January 2013. I am your host Alex Jones and whatever time zone
[08:24.800 --> 08:29.920]  you're listening to us day, night or of course in the morning whether you're a ship at sea.
[08:29.920 --> 08:35.800]  Our folks even listening as they fly into their local airport. It is good to have you
[08:35.800 --> 08:41.160]  all tuning into the broadcast today. We're gonna have wide open phones. Let me just go
[08:41.160 --> 08:46.280]  over the headlines here. Then I'm going to give the number out and then we will drill
[08:46.280 --> 08:49.040]  into this news and more throughout the day.
[08:49.040 --> 08:53.700]  But we are gonna have open phones throughout the full three hours today on the economy,
[08:53.700 --> 08:59.460]  the Second Amendment, the dollar. The news coming out at infowars.com that hacked emails
[08:59.460 --> 09:06.440]  reveal Washington approved plan to stage chemical weapons attack in Syria. Obama administration
[09:06.440 --> 09:15.080]  complicit in war crime. Also, Netanyahu deploy Syrian Iron Dome as Israeli minister claims
[09:15.080 --> 09:19.460]  US preparing surgical strikes against Iran.
[09:19.460 --> 09:23.640]  We also have Israel saying that they believe that Al Qaeda is gonna get chemical weapons
[09:23.640 --> 09:29.080]  so they have to attack the Syrian government who's fighting Al Qaeda. That's Reuters. The
[09:29.080 --> 09:34.720]  Senate is reaching a deal to open the borders open completely. We're gonna get into all
[09:34.720 --> 09:43.440]  that. In fact, it's amazing to see Jindal and to see even Rand Paul saying we've got
[09:43.440 --> 09:48.080]  to get with the times as Republicans.
[09:48.080 --> 09:55.200]  And just basically open the borders up. And the Pentagon's announcing they're taking any
[09:55.200 --> 10:01.860]  crosses down out of chapels. Major denominations are taking the crosses down. I mean, the point
[10:01.860 --> 10:06.520]  is it's all about social control and then and the Republicans are saying if we just
[10:06.520 --> 10:11.420]  become the Democrats, then they'll vote for us.
[10:11.420 --> 10:16.920]  And it's all a giant hoax. Conservatives and libertarians have said on record in the polls
[10:16.920 --> 10:21.160]  have shown this. They didn't vote for Mitt Romney because he wrote the assault weapons
[10:21.160 --> 10:30.600]  ban in his state and got it passed. The semi auto ban, Massachusetts. He was for open borders.
[10:30.600 --> 10:40.360]  He was for the carbon tax, wrote Obamacare. Do I need to keep listing all this? Again,
[10:40.360 --> 10:41.400]  people aren't voting.
[10:41.400 --> 10:48.200]  They're voting by digging in and buying firearms. They're voting by stopping to pay income tax
[10:48.200 --> 10:53.080]  the private Federal Reserve. I mean, they're reporting now 50 something million Americans
[10:53.080 --> 11:00.000]  aren't paying income tax. Good, the illegal aliens don't.
[11:00.000 --> 11:05.840]  This is what's happening. The American people, Congress has a 9% approval rating in the last
[11:05.840 --> 11:11.200]  even fake Gallup poll. I'm sure it's lower than that probably. The only way they can
[11:11.200 --> 11:15.400]  get you to support the government is by having a left right fake fight between Obama and
[11:15.400 --> 11:19.960]  the Republicans to make you think there's an illusion, sucking you into the debate.
[11:19.960 --> 11:26.000]  And having Obama come out for things so outrageous that then people are forced to go support
[11:26.000 --> 11:32.060]  the Republican establishment. Who then tells them, you know what, if we just give up and
[11:32.060 --> 11:38.780]  basically act like a Democratic Party of the 1990s. And then now the new Democratic Party
[11:38.780 --> 11:42.760]  acts like Mao Zedong, then we're gonna win.
[11:42.760 --> 11:47.240]  Well, there's no point in winning that because the globalists have won. And this is how they
[11:47.240 --> 11:51.920]  got Europe to give up their rights and have on average a 65% federal tax rate. You add
[11:51.920 --> 11:59.120]  local taxes in, the average European's paying over 80%. The average European is paying over
[11:59.120 --> 12:06.360]  80%, look it up. In one form or tax or another, that golfer was talking about leaving California
[12:06.360 --> 12:08.540]  a few weeks ago and got demonized by the media.
[12:08.540 --> 12:13.840]  So what of the media, the dying dinosaur media demonizes you? And he was saying, a Mickelson
[12:13.840 --> 12:19.840]  was saying, I'm paying 63, 65% federal and state tax. Well, that's only your state income
[12:19.840 --> 12:31.520]  tax and your federal tax, buh-buh. 40% federal, 13% state and then the property taxes and
[12:31.520 --> 12:36.880]  the fines, the fees, the regulation taxes, the water taxes, the cell phone taxes.
[12:36.880 --> 12:43.600]  The land use taxes, the hospital district taxes, the light bulb taxes. I mean, there's
[12:43.600 --> 12:48.880]  hundreds of taxes. Most of them you don't see, they're built in to the bill you get.
[12:48.880 --> 12:56.000]  Or if you do, it's a big list of fees and add-ons. It's a joke. But if you're a quote,
[12:56.000 --> 12:59.960]  globalist stakeholder, a Fortune 500, you're pretty much exempt from those taxes because
[12:59.960 --> 13:04.600]  you lobby and control and have your politicians in there.
[13:04.600 --> 13:11.240]  It's designed so only they can flourish. That's agenda 21. That's royalty 2.0 where the mega
[13:11.240 --> 13:17.600]  corporations and the old royalty and the big six global banks are all exempt from the rules.
[13:17.600 --> 13:24.880]  Congress is exempt from the Obamacare taxes. They're exempt from the pension taxes that
[13:24.880 --> 13:32.520]  are now law. They're exempt from insider trading laws. They're exempt from the gun laws in
[13:32.520 --> 13:35.840]  the new bill.
[13:35.840 --> 13:43.000]  Think of all the things they're exempt from. They're exempt from everything. Now, I was
[13:43.000 --> 13:47.900]  reading where Congress people shove a congressional badge and they can walk through the checkpoints.
[13:47.900 --> 13:51.320]  People ask, well, then why does Ron Paul get harassed? Why does Rand Paul? They refuse
[13:51.320 --> 13:57.940]  to use the passes to make a point.
[13:57.940 --> 14:05.600]  But this is the model. In fact, studying French royalty, British royalty, German royalty,
[14:05.600 --> 14:12.060]  Russian royalty in the last 500 years, go study it. It's a fascinating study. There
[14:12.060 --> 14:19.840]  had been reforms in Russia, in England, in the continent of Europe, in Austria, in France,
[14:19.840 --> 14:25.240]  in the Netherlands in the last 500 years that our forebears fought and died for in huge
[14:25.240 --> 14:29.360]  wars, huge civil wars so that government wasn't God.
[14:29.360 --> 14:34.960]  Because before that, the king or any of his designates would simply say, I want your wife,
[14:34.960 --> 14:40.800]  Prema Noctu, you gotta give her to me. I want your property. You couldn't own a dog unless
[14:40.800 --> 14:44.860]  the half its digits were cut off so that it couldn't chase the king's game.
[14:44.860 --> 14:52.740]  If you had a sheepdog, it was specially licensed and had several of its paws digits or pads
[14:52.740 --> 14:57.440]  cut off. You couldn't have a knife unless the end was cut off. You had to have it as
[14:57.440 --> 15:03.880]  a butcher. There was a tax on it and the end of it was cut off blunt. Death if you were
[15:03.880 --> 15:04.880]  found.
[15:04.880 --> 15:14.120]  That's up. Same laws in feudal Japan. Feudalism is what the Club of Rome, the CFR, the UN
[15:14.120 --> 15:19.720]  says they wanna go back to. Take the biological diversity assessment 1996, covered in my film
[15:19.720 --> 15:27.000]  Road to Tyranny 2001. And I show them, I show copies of the biological diversity assessment
[15:27.000 --> 15:31.120]  saying neo-feudalism is what we want.
[15:31.120 --> 15:35.920]  Making people poor so they can be managed and controlled. And so less resources get
[15:35.920 --> 15:41.960]  used better for the earth. They consciously wanna go back to royalty and the UN, the City
[15:41.960 --> 15:51.520]  of London, the Vatican, Israel to a great extent. And now the mega banks, look it up,
[15:51.520 --> 15:54.840]  they're pushing to get diplomatic immunity for their carbon taxes.
[15:54.840 --> 15:58.620]  They already have it at the IMF and World Bank when the mega banks are involved in those
[15:58.620 --> 16:02.560]  transactions. Now they want it in all of their transactions and to make their derivatives
[16:02.560 --> 16:08.120]  a global worlds, not national security, global world security operation where they cannot
[16:08.120 --> 16:13.920]  be investigated. These are just criminals taking it to the limit.
[16:13.920 --> 16:18.040]  They're con men, so they tell you we are now above the law. And this is what I talked about
[16:18.040 --> 16:26.480]  yesterday. By every definition historically, they are extreme royalty. They are more royal
[16:26.480 --> 16:33.680]  than a British king 400 years ago. They are more royal than Henry VIII. Henry VIII had
[16:33.680 --> 16:39.720]  to at least go to kangaroo courts to get a divorce or to kill somebody.
[16:39.720 --> 16:45.100]  Before that, kings would simply say, take him away, take them away, take whoever away.
[16:45.100 --> 16:50.460]  And he would get lords over the different sectors. Because you might have a good lord
[16:50.460 --> 16:54.280]  for a while, things would flourish, but always a bad one got in because of decadence. And
[16:54.280 --> 16:58.300]  then they would never get out of power. And they would start marrying their horses about
[16:58.300 --> 17:03.040]  Caligula or, again, I use the Nero example cuz it's so incredible.
[17:03.040 --> 17:08.560]  On record, they had these big 24 hour feast. And he would dress up as a werewolf and they'd
[17:08.560 --> 17:17.800]  chain little kids up. And Nero would run in and rip their throats out in a feverish thing
[17:17.800 --> 17:21.800]  with blood splattering all over him. I mean, that's what you get. I have articles here
[17:21.800 --> 17:27.500]  out of North Korea, Sunday Times of London investigation, confirming that the people
[17:27.500 --> 17:30.200]  eat their children.
[17:30.200 --> 17:35.080]  And that even the middle classes now go and at the meat markets buy people that have died
[17:35.080 --> 17:39.000]  of starvation and then just eat the meager meat off the bones. And that was reported
[17:39.000 --> 17:44.160]  by Vanity Fair like 12 years ago. I was sitting in a haircutting place and saw it and picked
[17:44.160 --> 17:48.360]  up Vanity Fair. They had an article about it, strangely enough.
[17:48.360 --> 17:55.960]  The point is, this is total government. This is what it creates, stagnation and collapse.
[17:55.960 --> 18:04.280]  And so the most extreme royalty could just say, take him away to the dungeon. Our forebearers
[18:04.280 --> 18:12.280]  in Europe fought for reforms in revolt after revolt against trained militaries that live
[18:12.280 --> 18:14.400]  behind the walls of the castle.
[18:14.400 --> 18:18.920]  And if you dared fight back against trained men in armor, because they killed your dad,
[18:18.920 --> 18:23.600]  killed your mom, killed your sister. You dared jumped up on one of them, beat their brains
[18:23.600 --> 18:29.040]  out. Out would come 500 armed men and they would kill sometimes your entire village.
[18:29.040 --> 18:35.160]  Burn it to the ground, kill everyone. They would come and do inspections of the little
[18:35.160 --> 18:40.560]  shack huts in the middle of the winter. In some cases when a third of the village was
[18:40.560 --> 18:45.280]  dying from malnutrition, you gotta go read these accounts.
[18:45.280 --> 18:52.440]  And they would come in and they would say, I smell meat cooking. You've got rabbit stew.
[18:52.440 --> 18:56.880]  And if you had an attractive daughter, they'd say, I'm gonna sit here and eat the stew.
[18:56.880 --> 19:01.600]  And then I'm gonna have sex with your daughter. And if you don't like it, I'm gonna kill you.
[19:01.600 --> 19:06.700]  Now that's if you were lucky, if you were lucky. A lot of times they'd already raped
[19:06.700 --> 19:14.440]  and killed so much, they just say, who do I wanna kill? I think I'll kill your wife.
[19:14.440 --> 19:18.840]  And they'd come in, and they'd tie your wife down, and they'd slit her throat right in
[19:18.840 --> 19:22.960]  front of you. How's that sound? You want royalty? You wanna live under royalty? You think that?
[19:22.960 --> 19:31.200]  Cuz they got big flowing robes and big crowns. People magazine, it's so cool. America was
[19:31.200 --> 19:37.800]  born out of hating this, okay? The enlightenment, the renaissance, all of it was about spitting
[19:37.800 --> 19:39.860]  on royalty, okay?
[19:39.860 --> 19:43.720]  And that's why they bad mouth George Washington. That's why they bad mouth our founding fathers,
[19:43.720 --> 19:47.840]  all of it. Because we are the antidote to their poison. We are the republic. We are
[19:47.840 --> 19:51.600]  the best there's ever been. And now we're going the opposite direction. And the traitors
[19:51.600 --> 19:56.060]  in the globalist media everywhere bad mouth our country and our forebearers and the Second
[19:56.060 --> 20:00.520]  Amendment because they're bringing us back into slavery. The news is coming up.
[20:00.520 --> 20:05.380]  Looking back on 2012, we ask ourselves, how did we ever survive? From natural disasters
[20:05.380 --> 20:09.960]  like Hurricane Sandy and the devastating summer drought to the family hardships brought on
[20:09.960 --> 20:14.920]  by a disastrous economy. Our hearts go out to those that have lost everything. At e Foods

[20:29.360 --> 20:34.120]  to be able to help my sister and niece. It is better to be prepared 10 years too early

[22:33.440 --> 22:38.280]  won't talk about gold IRAs? They've been available since 1986 yet the financial industry
[22:38.280 --> 22:42.900]  won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement. Gold has outperformed paper investments

[23:08.780 --> 23:15.120]  teaching others how to achieve more. But in 2010 I got a lesson of my own about RNA drops.
[23:15.120 --> 23:19.020]  I learned that there are millions of gene switches latent in every single cell of my
[23:19.020 --> 23:23.740]  body that are waiting for an activator. I learned by taking RNA drops I could begin
[23:23.740 --> 23:28.400]  to activate that power in my cells and achieve the more that I desire. I'd like to share
[23:28.400 --> 23:33.480]  what I discovered with you and send you a free 30-day supply of RNA drops valued at
[23:33.480 --> 23:41.700]  $50 for just the cost of shipping and handling. Go to RNAfreesample.com. That's RNAfreesample.com

[23:52.720 --> 24:08.440]  the more that's waiting for you. Ladies and gentlemen, I just want to finish up on the
[24:08.440 --> 24:14.140]  history lesson and then I'll get into Obama and Piers Morgan playing possum. They always
[24:14.140 --> 24:18.060]  come after the guns then say, oh, they're not coming after them. So everybody settles
[24:18.060 --> 24:22.280]  down so they can gauge the opposition and then they move forward against the guns again.
[24:22.280 --> 24:26.560]  I'm going to be breaking that down. We have articles up in fullwars.com. And again, we
[24:26.560 --> 24:31.000]  expected that just like they wrote the NDAA then said, don't worry, we're against it.
[24:31.000 --> 24:36.920]  I'm going to veto it so that no opposition would form. Then he still signed it. Then
[24:36.920 --> 24:43.600]  they bring out bills to repeal the NDAA, expanding it to actually get rid of posse commentatis.
[24:43.600 --> 24:48.760]  So often now they go, oh, we'll pass a bill to ban insider trading. Then the bill legalizes
[24:48.760 --> 24:53.320]  it. We'll pass a law to stop you being secretly disappeared, where the king says take him
[24:53.320 --> 24:59.960]  away. And a black bag is thrown over your head and you disappear into a spider hole.
[24:59.960 --> 25:03.960]  And then they have a new NDAA come out that says we just completely get rid of the posse
[25:03.960 --> 25:10.920]  commentatis. And then it's not even an issue. I mean, we've entered a world of deception
[25:10.920 --> 25:19.040]  where even though I'm focused on it, 16 hours a day conservatively, it's so over the top.
[25:19.040 --> 25:26.400]  It's such a full hologram like spectrum of lies that it even makes me get dizzy.
[25:26.400 --> 25:30.060]  And that's why a lot of people that trusted the system are now waking up, but they still
[25:30.060 --> 25:35.760]  have childlike minds. And so they then just believe everything's fake. Again, just because
[25:35.760 --> 25:40.640]  the media and the government lies doesn't mean that every alternative media is going
[25:40.640 --> 25:44.160]  to have all the answers. It doesn't mean I'm going to have all the answers.
[25:44.160 --> 25:50.200]  Just because the system is knowingly lying and twisting doesn't then mean that there's
[25:50.200 --> 25:59.160]  some other perfect truth out there as well. Remember that. Now, back to the issue of,
[25:59.160 --> 26:07.180]  let's just take European history because it's dominated the last 200 years. Feudalism settled
[26:07.180 --> 26:12.960]  in in Mesoamerica. Feudalism settled in in China, starting of course with the Chen Dynasties.
[26:12.960 --> 26:20.680]  It settled in in Japan. It settled in in Africa. Same system, you'd have royal chiefs with
[26:20.680 --> 26:24.760]  the dominant tribe and generally slave tribes around them who weren't really slaves. They
[26:24.760 --> 26:30.060]  were mainly light serfs compared to Europeans, but they still had to give fealty and basically
[26:30.060 --> 26:34.240]  bow down to whatever dominant tribe was in the area.
[26:34.240 --> 26:37.720]  Same thing with the Native American tribes. I mean, humans set up the same system over
[26:37.720 --> 26:46.840]  and over again. Middle East had the same deal pre-Muhammad, 700 and something years ago.
[26:46.840 --> 26:52.840]  And so when I say extreme royalty, generally it would be rule of God king where the king
[26:52.840 --> 26:58.600]  is worshiped as God, the Pharaoh is worshiped as God. And if you criticize in any way, you're
[26:58.600 --> 27:04.180]  not just seen as a traitor, you're seen as insane and as the devil and you are promptly
[27:04.180 --> 27:08.840]  killed or thrown into a hard labor slave bed.
[27:08.840 --> 27:15.200]  Now, that's been the norm. But Christians, if you go back about 550 years ago in Europe,
[27:15.200 --> 27:20.520]  lots of different sects started popping up saying no to feudal slavery, no to kings being
[27:20.520 --> 27:29.840]  absolute God men, no to the general public being total slaves, total slaves, total. And
[27:29.840 --> 27:34.760]  so because some people started to fight back and got some basic rights, well, everybody
[27:34.760 --> 27:36.400]  still wanted slaves.
[27:36.400 --> 27:42.560]  So the Arab slave trade was going with Africans they were grabbing out of the North and off
[27:42.560 --> 27:48.360]  the Gold Coast. And so these transatlantic slave trade began because nobody, the Christians
[27:48.360 --> 27:51.260]  weren't gonna put up, the real Christians in different groups, weren't gonna put up
[27:51.260 --> 27:52.260]  with slaves.
[27:52.260 --> 27:56.160]  They just been slaves. There were revolts all over France, all over Spain, all over
[27:56.160 --> 28:01.520]  what's Portugal, all over, just constant wars by people saying we're not gonna be slaves.
[28:01.520 --> 28:05.840]  Just like Chinese are revolting right now. They have hundreds of riots a week. Look it
[28:05.840 --> 28:11.560]  up. People with broom handles fighting troops with machine guns, okay?
[28:11.560 --> 28:15.240]  So people say China's gonna take over, the globalists are trying to prop it up. It could
[28:15.240 --> 28:18.960]  collapse at any time and that'd be a good thing for their people. Our government helped
[28:18.960 --> 28:23.580]  put Mao Zedong in in 49. It's because our government is a traitor government working
[28:23.580 --> 28:25.920]  for tyranny worldwide.
[28:25.920 --> 28:31.200]  And we've been taken over for a long time. Now they've just gotten bold in this program.
[28:31.200 --> 28:35.020]  And so when I say extreme royalty, extreme royalty could just say, take them to the dungeon
[28:35.020 --> 28:40.160]  off with their head, have you disappear. Royalty would smother their own family members, so
[28:40.160 --> 28:41.800]  that they wouldn't try to murder them.
[28:41.800 --> 28:48.160]  I mean, it was just the standard. Our forebearers in Europe, if you're European, fought against
[28:48.160 --> 28:56.960]  this, got some basic rights. In countless civil wars, the Dutch settlers, British settlers,
[28:56.960 --> 29:01.960]  others came over here for religious freedom. And of course, it immediately set up the same
[29:01.960 --> 29:04.480]  slave system with Indians and blacks and others.
[29:04.480 --> 29:07.440]  Because just because some people tried to get away from it, the same thing still kept
[29:07.440 --> 29:12.200]  getting set up. So it's an ongoing generational battle. Now they make you a slave through
[29:12.200 --> 29:15.720]  a prison record. Or they make you a slave where you've got to work for the government
[29:15.720 --> 29:18.880]  to have a job. Or they make you take vaccines to have a job.
[29:18.880 --> 29:23.000]  You see, see, there's all these new forms of high tech slavery, but the biggest slavery
[29:23.000 --> 29:27.400]  is over the mind. The globalists know how to control your mind and program you, so they
[29:27.400 --> 29:30.840]  don't have to physically have you chained up out in the barn, knowing you hate their
[29:30.840 --> 29:33.340]  guts and want to kill them any chance you get.
[29:33.340 --> 29:37.960]  They have taught us how to love our servitude. And now they're trying to bring back absolute
[29:37.960 --> 29:44.120]  rule of monarchs under the UN, under global national security. Governments are operating
[29:44.120 --> 29:49.720]  with extreme royal signets. They're operating like tyrant kings.
[29:49.720 --> 30:19.600]  Here on the march, the empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[32:04.800 --> 32:05.800]  Tyranny is here.
[32:05.800 --> 32:09.400]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[32:09.400 --> 32:12.080]  It really says that the state is God.
[32:12.080 --> 32:16.620]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states
[32:16.620 --> 32:17.860]  on earth.
[32:17.860 --> 32:22.680]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps now being
[32:22.680 --> 32:24.520]  expanded nationwide.
[32:24.520 --> 32:29.200]  Each documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful
[32:29.200 --> 32:30.620]  shadow state.
[32:30.620 --> 32:34.960]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depths to which our republic has fallen.
[32:34.960 --> 32:40.800]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship, body scanners, sound cameras,
[32:40.800 --> 32:44.880]  citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[32:44.880 --> 32:48.380]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[32:48.380 --> 32:50.420]  The police state isn't coming.

[33:12.320 --> 33:18.500]  You take the blue pill, the story ends, you wake up in your bed and believe whatever you
[33:18.500 --> 33:25.400]  want to do, you take the red pill, you stay in Wonderland and I show you how deep the
[33:25.400 --> 33:28.960]  rabbit hole goes.
[33:28.960 --> 33:35.880]  Remember all I'm offering is the truth, nothing more.
[33:35.880 --> 33:41.560]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[33:41.560 --> 33:48.600]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[33:48.600 --> 33:55.920]  All right, we're going to have open phones throughout the transmission here today.
[33:55.920 --> 33:59.880]  I'm going to get into some of the most important news right now.
[33:59.880 --> 34:03.520]  First time callers are welcome but it's just an open free for all.
[34:03.520 --> 34:13.120]  800-259-9231, 800-259-9231 and I did take a lot of calls yesterday once I got to your
[34:13.120 --> 34:18.880]  call so I'm going to try to move quickly through people, 800-259-9231.
[34:18.880 --> 34:22.120]  It's just the subject of understanding human history.
[34:22.120 --> 34:24.680]  Those that don't know history are doomed to repeat it.
[34:24.680 --> 34:28.000]  That's been said many, many times.
[34:28.000 --> 34:36.760]  So no one knows who first said that give a man a gun, he can rob a bank.
[34:36.760 --> 34:45.000]  Give a man a bank, he can rob the world but that's when banks use fractional reserve banking
[34:45.000 --> 34:51.360]  where they loan out $1 for every 10 cents they have on deposit or $10 for every dollar
[34:51.360 --> 34:54.280]  or $1,000 for every hundred.
[34:54.280 --> 34:55.320]  Now they don't even do that.
[34:55.320 --> 35:02.300]  They just create off derivatives a trillion off of $1 and then they buy the whole world
[35:02.300 --> 35:06.520]  because we accept the illusion and the fraud.
[35:06.520 --> 35:11.000]  The UN tells us they're above the law and that diplomatic immunity for narcotics trafficking,
[35:11.000 --> 35:12.920]  mass murder, you name it.
[35:12.920 --> 35:15.760]  The mega banks tell us they have immunity and are above the law.
[35:15.760 --> 35:18.480]  The police tell us they have immunity and are above the law.
[35:18.480 --> 35:19.480]  Not even true.
[35:19.480 --> 35:21.740]  They tell you it's a privilege to travel.
[35:21.740 --> 35:22.740]  No it's not.
[35:22.740 --> 35:24.600]  Now they're saying it's a privilege to own guns.
[35:24.600 --> 35:25.600]  No it's not.
[35:25.600 --> 35:28.320]  But they just tell you over and over again.
[35:28.320 --> 35:32.200]  Before I get to the news, we've launched two different big operations.
[35:32.200 --> 35:39.920]  One of them is Operation Sleeping Giant at prisonplanet.tv, Infowars Nightly News.
[35:39.920 --> 35:46.360]  You can get 11 memberships for $5.95 a month, create one username passcode, give it to friends
[35:46.360 --> 35:47.360]  and family.
[35:47.360 --> 35:53.560]  11 people can be logged on simultaneously and we've really upgraded and worked out bugs
[35:53.560 --> 35:54.560]  on the site.
[35:54.560 --> 36:00.760]  We've got 17 years of material, it's been up now 10 years, prisonplanet.tv and I wanna
[36:00.760 --> 36:04.920]  thank all of you that are members and watch the Nightly News and download the films.
[36:04.920 --> 36:08.920]  It is an armory of resistance but look, there's no excuse.
[36:08.920 --> 36:14.500]  Now is the time to go get a membership or to buy a couple memberships because we're
[36:14.500 --> 36:16.120]  giving it to you at cost.
[36:16.120 --> 36:20.080]  The goal is just to pay for the bandwidth and then to get people to watch it and say,
[36:20.080 --> 36:22.600]  hey, here's your free documentary film site.
[36:22.600 --> 36:25.280]  It's got ebooks, my book, Paul Watson's book.
[36:25.280 --> 36:28.400]  It's got the daytime radio show so you can watch it.
[36:28.400 --> 36:30.780]  All the radio listeners on XM, AM and FM.
[36:30.780 --> 36:35.440]  You should also have prisonplanet.tv memberships so you can watch the high-def archive of the
[36:35.440 --> 36:41.200]  day show, the nighttime show live, special reports on The Rogue, there's so much there.
[36:41.200 --> 36:46.340]  Prisonplanet.tv or get a yearly membership and this is gonna end next month.
[36:46.340 --> 36:48.480]  We do this every holiday season into the new year.
[36:48.480 --> 36:53.520]  You can get 5.3 months, it comes out to 5.3 months free when you sign up for a year.
[36:53.520 --> 37:01.440]  You get five plus months off the regular cost and again, 11 people can use it simultaneously.
[37:01.440 --> 37:05.300]  And unfortunately, not everybody who's got a membership or has been given the code is
[37:05.300 --> 37:09.600]  gonna use it so it's probably like 20, 30 people could use the same username, passcode.
[37:09.600 --> 37:14.980]  You may get locked out if more than 11 go log in but that's great news at any one time.
[37:14.980 --> 37:19.680]  So again, get the membership, I've built the platform, built the news operation.
[37:19.680 --> 37:22.680]  It's incredible reporters, research, guests.
[37:22.680 --> 37:29.480]  It's all waiting to go, hey, here's your free alternative real news platform.
[37:29.480 --> 37:32.360]  You are the Paul Revere, Operation Sleeping Giant.
[37:32.360 --> 37:37.360]  And then speaking of Paul Revere, we need your help to go to infoawars.com, to go to
[37:37.360 --> 37:40.200]  our YouTube page, to go to prisonplanet.tv.
[37:40.200 --> 37:45.760]  Go to infoawars.com forward slash contest, infoawars.com forward slash contest and get
[37:45.760 --> 37:48.960]  the four minute video for Operation Paul Revere.
[37:48.960 --> 37:56.920]  You've now got three months until the 30th of April and you win $100,000 first place,
[37:56.920 --> 37:59.600]  10,000 second, 5,000 third place.
[37:59.600 --> 38:04.320]  And again, I did this because the money we make goes right back into the operation to
[38:04.320 --> 38:05.320]  expand.
[38:05.320 --> 38:11.280]  I can't think of a better way, conservatively, I would guess 15, 20, 30, 40, 50 million people
[38:11.280 --> 38:14.880]  will end up seeing the 1,000 plus films that get made.
[38:14.880 --> 38:19.840]  It can be three minutes long, it can be fiction, nonfiction, drama, it can be up to two hours
[38:19.840 --> 38:21.420]  long.
[38:21.420 --> 38:24.600]  And again, all of you win by entering the contest.
[38:24.600 --> 38:29.520]  We need your help to get infoawars.com forward slash contest to have all of you go on IMDb
[38:29.520 --> 38:31.520]  who are members of that.
[38:31.520 --> 38:36.360]  For all of you who are listeners to go on YouTube, for all of you to go to all the film
[38:36.360 --> 38:39.360]  sites and say, hey, here is this contest.
[38:39.360 --> 38:44.120]  And you don't know who's out there that's a filmmaker, I saw people saying, I wish I
[38:44.120 --> 38:46.640]  had a film degree, I'd make a film.
[38:46.640 --> 38:51.720]  Folks, you go out and show corruption in your area, it isn't even about the quality, it
[38:51.720 --> 38:55.040]  may be about quality, it's about the heart.
[38:55.040 --> 38:57.760]  Because I'll tell you the real reason we're doing this is cuz it's a win win.
[38:57.760 --> 39:03.720]  We will reach tens of millions of people, conservatively, I mean, one film somebody
[39:03.720 --> 39:07.440]  makes will probably get seen 50 million times if it's like the Obama deception or loose
[39:07.440 --> 39:10.040]  change that I produced.
[39:10.040 --> 39:16.620]  And what you do is you defeat the globalist by making a film and that's how you start
[39:16.620 --> 39:18.520]  your journey of 1,000 miles.
[39:18.520 --> 39:22.720]  It's the resistance and then we're gonna take the top pool of people, may not even be the
[39:22.720 --> 39:23.720]  winners.
[39:23.720 --> 39:28.480]  This is whoever we can work it out with and come up with plans to launch three films produced
[39:28.480 --> 39:33.840]  a year with budgets of hundreds of thousands of dollars a piece and then hundreds of thousands
[39:33.840 --> 39:37.960]  of promotion to put it in theaters and I know that model, we can do it.
[39:37.960 --> 39:41.640]  We have the platform to promote it and make it work, okay?
[39:41.640 --> 39:46.320]  Instead of Dinesh D'Souza type stuff out there, we will have our films in the theaters, it's
[39:46.320 --> 39:49.720]  gonna be huge, absolutely huge.
[39:49.720 --> 39:56.080]  So you get a chance to then have films produced by Infowars, that's the real prize for filmmakers
[39:56.080 --> 39:57.080]  out there.
[39:57.080 --> 39:59.600]  The $100,000 is only the gateway.
[39:59.600 --> 40:04.200]  That's only the money to get the word out and to have hundreds of topics covered, okay?
[40:04.200 --> 40:09.400]  It's a way to get you to take action against the globalist as Paul Revere's in your area,
[40:09.400 --> 40:14.700]  whether it's the Second Amendment, Agenda 21, the New World Order, CPS, the open borders,
[40:14.700 --> 40:20.980]  public corruption, the military doing drills, now with live fire in major cities every week
[40:20.980 --> 40:28.240]  unannounced to acclimate us to military occupation, infowars.com forward slash contest.
[40:28.240 --> 40:35.960]  And yes, we have the new pro one from Pro Pure, all in one fluoride and it cuts out
[40:35.960 --> 40:38.280]  the other fluoride derivatives.
[40:38.280 --> 40:43.520]  Nobody has a fluoride filter in one with a silver impregnated ceramic.
[40:43.520 --> 40:53.520]  Pro one from Pro Pure, discounted 10% off infowarsstore.com or 888-25-3139.
[40:53.520 --> 40:58.120]  Okay, here's what's coming up after I take your calls and we start the next hour and
[40:58.120 --> 40:59.580]  then go back into calls.
[40:59.580 --> 41:03.320]  Law professor on CBS says, let's give up on the Constitution.
[41:03.320 --> 41:05.880]  Senior Obama official, we're going to kill the dollar.
[41:05.880 --> 41:10.160]  This is from one of the biggest money managers, hedge fund guys out there, Kyle Bass, who
[41:10.160 --> 41:11.160]  I wanna get on the show.
[41:11.160 --> 41:12.160]  This is chilling.
[41:12.160 --> 41:15.480]  He says he met with them, that's what they said.
[41:15.480 --> 41:20.960]  Brock's Glock in anti-gun DC media matters for America gave bodyguard illegal weapons
[41:20.960 --> 41:23.200]  to guard founder David Brock.
[41:23.200 --> 41:30.800]  Man, I tell you, these so-called liberal authoritarians are such cowards that every time I talk to
[41:30.800 --> 41:36.320]  them, I run into them at CNN or wherever I run into them, they always admit they have
[41:36.320 --> 41:39.720]  bodyguards.
[41:39.720 --> 41:40.720]  Here's Morgan Light about it.
[41:40.720 --> 41:43.560]  I've seen him on the news admitting bodyguards and being followed by three bodyguards.
[41:43.560 --> 41:47.440]  They had bodyguards there, they had them following us, looked like detectives to me.
[41:47.440 --> 41:53.660]  You know, all right, he's coming out, he's coming in, my gosh, there he is.
[41:53.660 --> 41:55.960]  This is the type of stuff going on.
[41:55.960 --> 41:59.440]  They have bodyguards, well, they're gonna exempt themselves where they can own guns.
[41:59.440 --> 42:03.980]  Any government official, not servant, title of nobility, that's a title of nobility when
[42:03.980 --> 42:07.420]  they're exempt from the laws and they get special perks.
[42:07.420 --> 42:09.640]  That is what America was founded against.
[42:09.640 --> 42:14.260]  See, you're all taught all day, black, white, Northern Southerner, Easterner, Westerner,
[42:14.260 --> 42:19.320]  Catholic Christian against each other, male, female, gay, straight.
[42:19.320 --> 42:23.680]  Meanwhile, the government is giving itself titles of nobility and corporations are exempt
[42:23.680 --> 42:24.760]  from the taxes.
[42:24.760 --> 42:28.040]  They lobby to get passed, I mean, so they get your tax money.
[42:28.040 --> 42:32.880]  I mean, ladies and gentlemen, they're throwing the kitchen sink at it.
[42:32.880 --> 42:37.160]  I mean, I see articles where they go, all gun owners are white racists, they are Nazis,
[42:37.160 --> 42:38.680]  we will defeat them.
[42:38.680 --> 42:40.520]  Don't wage war against them.
[42:40.520 --> 42:46.520]  Just bizarro stuff while Obama plays the good cop going, I go hunting, I want guns, I won't
[42:46.520 --> 42:47.960]  take your guns.
[42:47.960 --> 42:52.200]  He's back to saying he won't take his guns when they've got something like 15 bills introduced
[42:52.200 --> 42:54.000]  last time I checked.
[42:54.000 --> 43:02.040]  To ban ammo, tax ammo, make you turn guns in, banning thousands, not 158, it's 158 basic
[43:02.040 --> 43:04.360]  designs and all their variants.
[43:04.360 --> 43:06.960]  It's thousands of guns.
[43:06.960 --> 43:07.960]  Thousands of guns.
[43:07.960 --> 43:13.080]  It's just all out and Obama's like, here's a quote.
[43:13.080 --> 43:16.640]  He said that he's understandable that people are protective of their family traditions
[43:16.640 --> 43:17.640]  when it comes to hunting.
[43:17.640 --> 43:18.880]  It's not about hunting, buddy.
[43:18.880 --> 43:22.580]  So quote, gun control advocates also need to do, quote, a little more listening than
[43:22.580 --> 43:26.160]  they do sometimes in debate.
[43:26.160 --> 43:29.620]  Did you hear that?
[43:29.620 --> 43:35.680]  And see, Piers Morgan comes out and says, I've lost the gun control debate.
[43:35.680 --> 43:38.720]  He's gonna be another mass shooting with the hype they've been doing.
[43:38.720 --> 43:40.040]  They've got computer algorithms.
[43:40.040 --> 43:41.800]  They know a nut's gonna copycat.
[43:41.800 --> 43:44.600]  And if that doesn't happen, well, they'll have to help, won't they?
[43:44.600 --> 43:49.120]  They'll just have to have somebody under a DARPA mind control contract for 30 something
[43:49.120 --> 43:56.560]  thousand a year and with an Air Force psychiatrist over them, something will just have to happen,
[43:56.560 --> 43:57.560]  won't it?
[43:57.560 --> 44:01.560]  Of course, they would stage Fast and Furious that killed thousands, which it came out to
[44:01.560 --> 44:02.760]  blame the Second Amendment.
[44:02.760 --> 44:08.120]  The memos were doing this, subordinates are complaining, but they've been told it's for
[44:08.120 --> 44:10.280]  a gun control push.
[44:10.280 --> 44:14.400]  Imagine the ATF people picked because they'll follow orders and are bullies.
[44:14.400 --> 44:18.080]  The most nasty federal agency out there cuz it comes out of the whiskey regulators.
[44:18.080 --> 44:19.080]  Look into that whole story.
[44:19.080 --> 44:26.760]  They were just mutineous, mutineous, a new word, absolutely out of control, piratical
[44:26.760 --> 44:32.080]  group against the Constitution and the Whiskey Wars and all the rest of it.
[44:32.080 --> 44:35.520]  That was one of the first federal agencies to go outside its jurisdiction.
[44:35.520 --> 44:37.040]  Even they're like, why are we doing this?
[44:37.040 --> 44:39.200]  They're like, well, we're gonna blame the Second Amendment.
[44:39.200 --> 44:40.920]  Okay, I see.
[44:40.920 --> 44:43.520]  See, there's no end to what they could pull.
[44:43.520 --> 44:47.760]  So they're playing possum right now with Obama goes hunting, we go skeet shooting in Camp
[44:47.760 --> 44:50.480]  David, everything's all right.
[44:50.480 --> 44:52.920]  Come on, come on.
[44:52.920 --> 44:57.600]  Would I lie to you, baby, when I say something that wasn't true?
[44:57.600 --> 45:03.240]  Tell me, honey, would the government lie to you?
[45:03.240 --> 45:05.680]  And the answer is, of course, they don't lie.
[45:05.680 --> 45:06.680]  I mean, they're good.
[45:06.680 --> 45:10.080]  Piers Morgan said there were no riots last year in London or in England.
[45:10.080 --> 45:11.080]  He said, no, there weren't.
[45:11.080 --> 45:16.200]  And he goes, I don't have bodyguards when I debated him.
[45:16.200 --> 45:17.200]  Why not?
[45:17.200 --> 45:18.360]  He has nothing but disdain for you.
[45:18.360 --> 45:19.920]  He's an enemy operative.
[45:19.920 --> 45:24.400]  I had Time Magazine call me up the other day, and I just said, you're an enemy operative.
[45:24.400 --> 45:26.880]  And I said, I know what you're doing, and the guy was laughing.
[45:26.880 --> 45:27.880]  And I said, don't laugh.
[45:27.880 --> 45:28.880]  You know it's true.
[45:28.880 --> 45:31.480]  And I'm done talking to you.
[45:31.480 --> 45:32.480]  You're an enemy operative.
[45:32.480 --> 45:36.080]  See, we got to totally recognize it or there's no future.
[45:36.080 --> 45:40.800]  You either see it for what it is and stop, I mean, look at the Republican leadership
[45:40.800 --> 45:43.040]  telling you, we got to do what the Democrats say.
[45:43.040 --> 45:44.040]  That's how we're going to win.
[45:44.040 --> 45:48.560]  I mean, what a sellout mind game fraud.
[45:48.560 --> 45:54.360]  What a psyop, because the very same mega bank interest that run the Democrats have all financed
[45:54.360 --> 45:57.920]  them and they're telling them, you get this done if you want to be president.
[45:57.920 --> 45:59.720]  You get this done, Senator.
[45:59.720 --> 46:06.300]  You get this done, House member, if you want to be part of this, you play ball while they
[46:06.300 --> 46:09.760]  gear up for the collapse of the dollar and all out.
[46:09.760 --> 46:12.280]  See, that's what Congress is getting in line.
[46:12.280 --> 46:15.240]  They're being told, yeah, there's going to be blood in the streets, martial law, just
[46:15.240 --> 46:21.720]  like Paulson told Congress four years ago, four plus years ago now.
[46:21.720 --> 46:31.360]  So coming up, but again, Obama says you need to do a little more listening than you do
[46:31.360 --> 46:32.360]  sometimes.
[46:32.360 --> 46:37.440]  Imagine, a known liar patronizing you going, I don't want your guns, I never want to come
[46:37.440 --> 46:38.440]  take them.
[46:38.440 --> 46:41.880]  You need to do a little more listening, he said in a speech yesterday, and he's saying
[46:41.880 --> 46:42.880]  it again today.
[46:42.880 --> 46:47.040]  I don't want your guns, how ridiculous.
[46:47.040 --> 46:48.040]  There's no big government.
[46:48.040 --> 46:53.320]  Now, I'm not going to raise taxes on anybody's payroll unless they make over a quarter million
[46:53.320 --> 46:54.320]  a year.
[46:54.320 --> 46:59.180]  They raise it on people making way lower than that.
[46:59.180 --> 47:05.360]  They know exactly what they are doing.
[47:05.360 --> 47:09.240]  All right, let's start going to the phone calls now.
[47:09.240 --> 47:16.280]  I haven't even scratched the surface yet, DHS buys 7,000 full auto assault rifles, calls
[47:16.280 --> 47:24.160]  them personal defense weapons, full auto, which you don't need unless you're mowing
[47:24.160 --> 47:25.160]  whole crowds down.
[47:25.160 --> 47:30.080]  I mean, by the way, there's this fetishizing full auto, I wouldn't want full auto unless
[47:30.080 --> 47:41.560]  I was guarding a fortified emplacement expecting to face human wave attacks.
[47:41.560 --> 47:45.720]  Was it good during Chinese human wave attacks in North Korea?
[47:45.720 --> 47:47.200]  In the Korean War?
[47:47.200 --> 47:48.200]  Yeah.
[47:48.200 --> 47:53.120]  Would it be good in a foxhole with a heavy machine gun being charged?
[47:53.120 --> 47:54.600]  Yeah.
[47:54.600 --> 47:58.880]  But they're worthless anywhere else.
[47:58.880 --> 48:02.920]  Anywhere else they are worthless, worthless, worthless, worthless.
[48:02.920 --> 48:06.480]  They are only good, which the army's been training for, and the Marines, they put it
[48:06.480 --> 48:11.640]  on the news, where they train to fight US citizens in human waves, they mow them down.
[48:11.640 --> 48:13.980]  And we got footage of that, people couldn't believe it.
[48:13.980 --> 48:16.480]  Now they just say, we're having a fun game.
[48:16.480 --> 48:20.800]  We're practicing mowing down zombies wearing football jerseys.
[48:20.800 --> 48:24.520]  That's how they, again, it's all a big joke on us.
[48:24.520 --> 48:29.560]  And now they're getting weapons, the only thing they're good for, and even then they're
[48:29.560 --> 48:36.440]  not good, in my view, especially with these handheld fully auto, is to hold the weapon
[48:36.440 --> 48:40.360]  down or have it on a tripod and just shoot across a crowd of people running at you.
[48:40.360 --> 48:46.200]  And even then you don't want that, you want to go double tap each person.
[48:46.200 --> 48:48.480]  But see, this is what idiots thrown into marksmanship want.
[48:48.480 --> 48:52.440]  This is exactly, you like the New York cops that shot nine people, and then the media
[48:52.440 --> 48:55.700]  tried to cover it up and say, one guy done it, when it was one guy shooting somebody
[48:55.700 --> 49:01.400]  else and the cops just shoot, well, at least it was more than nine, wasn't it?
[49:01.400 --> 49:05.440]  Just start firing wildly, cuz they watch Hollywood movies.
[49:05.440 --> 49:10.600]  That's their idea of how to use a firearm.
[49:10.600 --> 49:18.360]  DHS buys 7,000 full auto assault rifles, calls them personal defense weapons.
[49:18.360 --> 49:22.640]  And again, they're saying, we got a federal law where all federal employees and all police
[49:22.640 --> 49:28.120]  period, you're exempt from gun laws even after you're out of government, you are now God.
[49:28.120 --> 49:31.920]  And they say, well, we got to protect ourselves, criminals will have guns and it's all a big
[49:31.920 --> 49:32.920]  joke.
[49:32.920 --> 49:35.160]  We're gonna take your guns and we're exempt.
[49:35.160 --> 49:36.920]  How's that sound, scum?
[49:36.920 --> 49:40.280]  And we're exempt from insider trading.
[49:40.280 --> 49:43.080]  And power plants owned by the globalists, they're exempt.
[49:43.080 --> 49:46.480]  Everybody else's, a bunch of big power plants being shut down today, one of the biggest
[49:46.480 --> 49:48.360]  in Texas.
[49:48.360 --> 49:50.920]  Brand new power plants that were built will never be opened.
[49:50.920 --> 50:00.520]  And you're gonna pay more because see, the general public is literally in la la land
[50:00.520 --> 50:05.880]  right now, and has no idea even what planet they're living on.
[50:05.880 --> 50:07.880]  Here's some of the other ones.
[50:07.880 --> 50:11.960]  Some of the other headlines we've got on the Second Amendment, Barack Obama, I go shooting
[50:11.960 --> 50:14.520]  all the time, we're gonna get into that.
[50:14.520 --> 50:18.160]  Big cities finance, war on guns may backfire, business week.
[50:18.160 --> 50:22.320]  Bloomberg saying, well, I've already tried to sue gun manufacturers, it doesn't work.
[50:22.320 --> 50:24.320]  And I've already tried to get money pulled out of them.
[50:24.320 --> 50:29.000]  But these are such valuable stocks, everybody just buys them up.
[50:29.000 --> 50:32.920]  Obama manual saying, banks shouldn't take any gun owners as customers, they shouldn't
[50:32.920 --> 50:35.360]  take gun shops, that's called racketeering.
[50:35.360 --> 50:37.000]  That's how a godfather would operate.
[50:37.000 --> 50:40.480]  Yeah, you know what, you're not gonna be able to do any business.
[50:40.480 --> 50:43.480]  We're gonna shut you down, it's outside of law, all right?
[50:43.480 --> 50:47.840]  And I got articles here with the ATF showing up at gun shops and saying, it's legal to
[50:47.840 --> 50:52.200]  sell semi-auto, but if you don't, stop selling, we're gonna shut you down, okay?
[50:52.200 --> 50:57.040]  And they even tell him, quote, I'm not here to bust your chops, but don't make me hurt
[50:57.040 --> 51:00.480]  yous.
[51:00.480 --> 51:04.220]  If you've ever wanted one of our best selling generators, but we're waiting for an offer
[51:04.220 --> 51:09.160]  so crazy you couldn't refuse, then you're not gonna wanna miss this exciting message.
[51:09.160 --> 51:10.160]  Here's why.
[51:10.160 --> 51:13.240]  Our solar generators provide life saving electrical power.
[51:13.240 --> 51:18.880]  And unlike gas generators, solar generators run quietly, emit no fumes, and produce electricity
[51:18.880 --> 51:19.920]  from the sun.
[51:19.920 --> 51:23.320]  So when the lights go out, you'll always have the power you need.
[51:23.320 --> 51:24.960]  Now here's the best part.
[51:24.960 --> 51:29.640]  Every year we accumulate a few solar generators that we just can't sell as new.
[51:29.640 --> 51:34.800]  We put them in a special spot in our warehouse, and we discount them heavily at the end of
[51:34.800 --> 51:35.800]  each year.
[51:35.800 --> 51:39.540]  We call them scratch and dent units, but they're really just like new.
[51:39.540 --> 51:44.760]  Each unit comes with a full factory warranty and special bonuses you just won't believe.
[51:44.760 --> 51:46.300]  Don't wait, they go fast.
[51:46.300 --> 51:50.180]  Go to scratchanddentsolar.com, that's scratchanddentsolar.com.

[52:05.920 --> 52:08.280]  We need assistance, please.
[52:08.280 --> 52:11.760]  Those we should be able to depend on, let us down.
[52:11.760 --> 52:16.260]  Federal and state and local officials saying help is on the way, while the folks here in
[52:16.260 --> 52:18.320]  Bell Harbor say show me.
[52:18.320 --> 52:20.760]  Don't depend on the government to save you.

[52:59.940 --> 53:02.960]  Is this the year you finally get serious about your family's drinking water?

[53:06.560 --> 53:09.440]  Did you know that over 60% of municipal water is fluoridated?

[53:12.700 --> 53:16.760]  capability to significantly reduce dangerous chlorine, fluoride, arsenic, and disinfection
[53:16.760 --> 53:20.480]  byproducts from municipal water via the black Berkey and PF line of filters.

[53:31.240 --> 53:33.720]  using water filtered by your Berkey Water Filter.

[53:59.440 --> 54:14.440]  The preacher man says it's the end of time In the Mississippi River she's a-goin' dry
[54:14.440 --> 54:25.640]  interest is up and the stock market's down And you're only gettin' mugged if you go downtown
[54:25.640 --> 54:31.560]  I live back in the woods, you see A woman and the kids and the dogs and the
[54:31.560 --> 54:32.560]  blues
[54:32.560 --> 54:38.040]  Alright, we got two plus hours coming up here, just chock full of globalist treason.
[54:38.040 --> 54:40.920]  They've decided to go whole hog because they know everything's gonna collapse.
[54:40.920 --> 54:43.000]  They've decided to destroy the dollar.
[54:43.000 --> 54:46.120]  We've got them on record with that.
[54:46.120 --> 54:52.600]  It's just gonna be unmitigated and the power structure knows this and so it's us or them.
[54:52.600 --> 54:53.600]  They're committed.
[54:53.600 --> 54:57.080]  You have to understand that in police and military, it's time to decide which side you're
[54:57.080 --> 55:00.400]  on and not just go buy guns and get ready for a civil war.
[55:00.400 --> 55:01.840]  You don't want that to happen.
[55:01.840 --> 55:08.140]  We want to push to turn this around peacefully and the globalists may back off if we do that.
[55:08.140 --> 55:11.800]  Right now they're so concerned, they're backing off going, we don't want your guns.
[55:11.800 --> 55:18.560]  Okay, you win until they stage the next event or use the next event that they provocateur
[55:18.560 --> 55:21.980]  or the next real event to say, see, we told you so.
[55:21.980 --> 55:24.000]  We're the good guys against violence.
[55:24.000 --> 55:27.080]  It's like saying, I'm the president and I'm against cancer.
[55:27.080 --> 55:30.320]  And anytime there's cancer, it's the fault of libertarians.
[55:30.320 --> 55:34.760]  Oh, another cancer case, see, you didn't give me more power to fix that.
[55:34.760 --> 55:39.600]  I mean, they know out of 315 million people, there'll be more shootings.
[55:39.600 --> 55:43.360]  And they hope the public doesn't learn that crime has dropped by close to half.
[55:43.360 --> 55:46.440]  They hope the public doesn't, well, they just want to get up there and be emotional.
[55:46.440 --> 55:51.260]  We care so much and distract you from what they've done to the economy, to their looting,
[55:51.260 --> 55:56.320]  to their fast and furious, to Solyndra, to all the corruption, to all their bodyguards,
[55:56.320 --> 56:04.180]  to them trying to pass a law where they're exempt, I mean, that's unprecedented.
[56:04.180 --> 56:11.800]  And then the Chicago mob boss, I mean, unbelievably corrupt, called the Godfather by the great
[56:11.800 --> 56:19.860]  people of Chicago, Rahm Emanuel says, quote, we need to lean on the big banks to not do
[56:19.860 --> 56:24.160]  business with any type of gun business.
[56:24.160 --> 56:26.360]  I mean, that's called torturous interference.
[56:26.360 --> 56:29.000]  That's what the mafia does.
[56:29.000 --> 56:32.080]  Bad things are gonna, I mean, the ATF, and I'm talking to the gun dealers right now,
[56:32.080 --> 56:34.200]  I'm trying to get them on air, they're obviously all scared.
[56:34.200 --> 56:36.760]  Folks, if you give in to fear, it's all over.
[56:36.760 --> 56:40.400]  Start the second hour and go directly to your calls, I promise.
[56:40.400 --> 56:42.000]  We're gonna break in about three minutes.
[56:42.000 --> 56:49.680]  Folks, see, I don't have courage, I got instinct, okay, where I get upset by bullies and scum
[56:49.680 --> 56:51.720]  and people pushing me around, okay?
[56:51.720 --> 56:55.780]  You've got to find that American instinct again and just say, look, I don't care how
[56:55.780 --> 56:59.880]  this ends, I'm not gonna get down and kiss your big, ugly butt.
[56:59.880 --> 57:00.880]  You understand?
[57:00.880 --> 57:01.880]  It isn't happening.
[57:01.880 --> 57:03.120]  Do you understand that?
[57:03.120 --> 57:04.120]  I don't care.
[57:04.120 --> 57:07.560]  I mean, I'm telling you, it feels so good to be committed.
[57:07.560 --> 57:12.400]  And if these people want a war, don't worry, they're gonna get one and they're gonna run.
[57:12.400 --> 57:15.600]  That's why they don't care if there's a war, they've done it in other countries over and
[57:15.600 --> 57:16.600]  over again.
[57:16.600 --> 57:19.800]  It's in the IMF World Bank, 112-point plan leaked in 2002.
[57:19.800 --> 57:22.360]  They'll all pull out while there's a civil war here.
[57:22.360 --> 57:28.960]  But listen, when we get the country back, we're gonna come get you under law.
[57:28.960 --> 57:31.680]  Just like there were Nazi hunters, there's gonna be globalist hunters, and we're gonna
[57:31.680 --> 57:34.480]  take you back here for a trial.
[57:34.480 --> 57:38.320]  You're not getting away with this new world order, and they're all buying houses in Switzerland.
[57:38.320 --> 57:40.480]  They're all buying houses in South America.
[57:40.480 --> 57:42.440]  They're all buying houses in the Cook Islands.
[57:42.440 --> 57:44.360]  Most of these globalists have left the country, folks.
[57:44.360 --> 57:46.240]  Does that sound like they're very confident?
[57:46.240 --> 57:51.320]  They have already evacuated the Death Star, okay?
[57:51.320 --> 57:52.800]  They've all evacuated the Death Star.
[57:52.800 --> 57:56.000]  You know why they've evacuated?
[57:56.000 --> 58:00.240]  Because they know we're gonna blow this thing sky high, politically.
[58:00.240 --> 58:01.920]  The question is, how bad is it gonna get?
[58:01.920 --> 58:04.920]  So that's one reason they're getting even more criminal, is they're realizing they're
[58:04.920 --> 58:05.920]  not gonna make it.
[58:05.920 --> 58:08.040]  I can see where this is going, folks.
[58:08.040 --> 58:10.720]  They're not gonna make it unless they cause World War III.
[58:10.720 --> 58:16.280]  They need a big enough, giant, crazy war with nukes going off and bioweapons where everybody
[58:16.280 --> 58:20.000]  gets scared and goes, I'll do what you're saying, I'll do what you're saying.
[58:20.000 --> 58:24.160]  And you're not gonna make it out of that either.
[58:24.160 --> 58:26.360]  You guys are going down like Hitler.
[58:26.360 --> 58:31.160]  I mean, the communist Chinese, Mao was so bad they finally arrested his wife and made
[58:31.160 --> 58:32.160]  him step down.
[58:32.160 --> 58:33.840]  The same thing's gonna happen to you guys.
[58:33.840 --> 58:36.040]  You are bad for business.
[58:36.040 --> 58:39.640]  Even the criminal syndicates are gonna bring you down.
[58:39.640 --> 58:50.480]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[58:50.480 --> 58:55.440]  Looking back on 2012, we ask ourselves, how did we ever survive from natural disasters
[58:55.440 --> 59:00.040]  like Hurricane Sandy and the devastating summer drought to the family hardships brought on
[59:00.040 --> 59:01.880]  by a disastrous economy?

[59:08.400 --> 59:11.320]  life's storm by having a supply of food on hand.
[59:11.320 --> 59:15.880]  After Hurricane Sandy, Danny from New York City wrote, almost all the grocery stores
[59:15.880 --> 59:20.680]  are closed, but I managed to get my e Foods just in time to be able to help my sister
[59:20.680 --> 59:21.680]  and niece.
[59:21.680 --> 59:25.480]  It is better to be prepared 10 years too early than one day too late.

[01:00:11.040 --> 01:00:13.160]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.160 --> 01:00:17.400]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.400 --> 01:00:23.960]  And now live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:23.960 --> 01:00:35.120]  All right, we're taking your phone calls.
[01:00:35.120 --> 01:00:39.320]  I covered just a cornucopia of key news and information in the last hour.
[01:00:39.320 --> 01:00:40.920]  I am your host, Alex Jones.
[01:00:40.920 --> 01:00:41.920]  Let's go to your calls.
[01:00:41.920 --> 01:00:46.120]  We've got a Todd, Truth Raider, Terry, Danny, Anti-New World Order, and many others.
[01:00:46.120 --> 01:00:50.320]  The toll-free number to join us is 800-25-99231.
[01:00:50.320 --> 01:00:52.120]  Todd in California, you're on the air.
[01:00:52.120 --> 01:00:53.120]  Go ahead.
[01:00:53.120 --> 01:00:56.440]  Hey, good afternoon and good morning to you, Alex Jones.
[01:00:56.440 --> 01:00:59.640]  I've been a long, long-time listener, first-time caller.
[01:00:59.640 --> 01:01:00.640]  Thank you for taking my call.
[01:01:00.640 --> 01:01:01.640]  Thank you for calling, brother.
[01:01:01.640 --> 01:01:05.640]  I have several questions.
[01:01:05.640 --> 01:01:10.720]  I would like to start an impeachment process here in California against Dianne Feinstein,
[01:01:10.720 --> 01:01:12.080]  Boxer and Pelosi.
[01:01:12.080 --> 01:01:17.560]  Obviously, they have implicated themselves in financial fraudery.
[01:01:17.560 --> 01:01:24.520]  And I've looked up several places online on how to do that, and I might even just take
[01:01:24.520 --> 01:01:31.040]  this opportunity also to start the process in my filming of the whole process.
[01:01:31.040 --> 01:01:33.200]  And what would you recommend that I do?
[01:01:33.200 --> 01:01:37.960]  I know Mark Dice is out here, and I would actually like to get with him as well.
[01:01:37.960 --> 01:01:39.360]  Oh, yeah, he's a super guy.
[01:01:39.360 --> 01:01:40.360]  Go work with him.
[01:01:40.360 --> 01:01:41.360]  That's a great idea.
[01:01:41.360 --> 01:01:47.440]  What great work he's done, like when he did the video, people ought to go check it out,
[01:01:47.440 --> 01:01:52.040]  where he went and talked about how they were zombies on the Black Friday deal.
[01:01:52.040 --> 01:01:54.320]  Just a great, great journalistic idea.
[01:01:54.320 --> 01:01:57.080]  Todd, I think you ought to do that.
[01:01:57.080 --> 01:02:03.200]  So what is your kind of, or not kind of, but what would your recommendation be?
[01:02:03.200 --> 01:02:10.180]  And by the way, just to let you know, as I'm calling in, I have turned on a probably over
[01:02:10.180 --> 01:02:16.200]  2,000 people to your website, to your radio show, so I know they're listening to me right
[01:02:16.200 --> 01:02:17.200]  now.
[01:02:17.200 --> 01:02:22.480]  So as I'm speaking to you, I know there's hundreds of people that know me that are listening,
[01:02:22.480 --> 01:02:25.840]  and I want to start this process within this week.
[01:02:25.840 --> 01:02:29.920]  Well, I mean, by the way, we need to just point out that just because they say it's
[01:02:29.920 --> 01:02:35.200]  legal to insider trade, you know, again, Congress has said it's okay to own people before.
[01:02:35.200 --> 01:02:37.480]  That doesn't mean it's really legal.
[01:02:37.480 --> 01:02:41.040]  We need to just talk about Feinstein, went to Congress with less than a million, and
[01:02:41.040 --> 01:02:45.440]  now some estimates are 150 million, some are as low as 76 million.
[01:02:45.440 --> 01:02:51.760]  And we'd like to know why biotech companies with no employees or no money get a $25 million
[01:02:51.760 --> 01:02:56.620]  bill she sponsored, and then she gets a couple million of it the next day after they get
[01:02:56.620 --> 01:02:57.620]  that money.
[01:02:57.620 --> 01:02:59.960]  So, you know, it's time.
[01:02:59.960 --> 01:03:04.200]  I would make a documentary, that's an idea of going and being in front of her office
[01:03:04.200 --> 01:03:07.480]  or her house every day, and just showing what she does.
[01:03:07.480 --> 01:03:12.200]  I mean, it's time to let these gangsters know that we know where they live.
[01:03:12.200 --> 01:03:15.080]  You think you're gonna take our guns and exempt yourself and you're gonna have the guns?
[01:03:15.080 --> 01:03:17.880]  You think you're gonna walk all over us, you witch?
[01:03:17.880 --> 01:03:18.960]  We're done, we're done.
[01:03:18.960 --> 01:03:22.920]  We're not your slaves, you big bucket of pus, you maggot-filled rat.
[01:03:22.920 --> 01:03:25.760]  I appreciate your call, Todd, thanks for the call.
[01:03:25.760 --> 01:03:27.800]  Let's talk to Truth Raider.
[01:03:27.800 --> 01:03:29.800]  You're on the air, go ahead.
[01:03:29.800 --> 01:03:34.320]  Greetings, Alex, and to all the listeners out there in the info world.
[01:03:34.320 --> 01:03:36.320]  Hey, buddy, go ahead.
[01:03:36.320 --> 01:03:38.000]  Well, I'm no longer sick.
[01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:41.440]  I've taken my Beyond Tangy Tangerine and I'm detoxing for freedom.
[01:03:41.440 --> 01:03:44.560]  Good job, brother, very exciting.
[01:03:44.560 --> 01:03:46.560]  Right, two things.
[01:03:46.560 --> 01:03:53.480]  Today, let's stop and take a moment to reflect the seven people who lost their lives today
[01:03:53.480 --> 01:03:55.240]  in the spatial discovery.
[01:03:55.240 --> 01:03:59.480]  All right, I appreciate your call.
[01:03:59.480 --> 01:04:02.440]  Let's go to Terry in Georgia.
[01:04:02.440 --> 01:04:03.440]  You're on the air, go ahead.
[01:04:03.440 --> 01:04:04.440]  Hey, Alex, how are you?
[01:04:04.440 --> 01:04:05.440]  Good, go ahead.
[01:04:05.440 --> 01:04:12.160]  Yeah, I got something for you.
[01:04:12.160 --> 01:04:18.840]  We have, of course, the NDAA, which is totally unconstitutional, but they don't follow the
[01:04:18.840 --> 01:04:21.160]  Constitution anyway, so it doesn't really matter.
[01:04:21.160 --> 01:04:29.600]  The problem that I have is a judge says, hey, we're not going to, no, this is not a constitution,
[01:04:29.600 --> 01:04:34.520]  we're not going to accept this, this is not for the American people, and then their lawyers
[01:04:34.520 --> 01:04:37.800]  go around, turn around, and overturn it right away.
[01:04:37.800 --> 01:04:46.400]  The problem that we have is that information is at the speed of light, and with that information,
[01:04:46.400 --> 01:04:52.480]  like back in 1776, information didn't travel like this, they're spying on everything that
[01:04:52.480 --> 01:04:53.480]  we do.
[01:04:53.480 --> 01:04:55.680]  But that's good, we can turn that around against them.
[01:04:55.680 --> 01:05:02.560]  So what if the criminals spy, they know about our numbers surging.
[01:05:02.560 --> 01:05:08.840]  If you want an American company with American products made by Americans, here is the Cal
[01:05:08.840 --> 01:05:10.520]  Ben Soap Company.
[01:05:10.520 --> 01:05:14.820]  Alex and his staff have used these pure soap products for years.

[01:05:19.580 --> 01:05:22.080]  that are earth friendly and safe.

[01:05:40.480 --> 01:05:41.480]  needs.
[01:05:41.480 --> 01:05:43.280]  This is an amazing deal.
[01:05:43.280 --> 01:05:48.480]  You can save thousands of dollars and you will love the way real soap makes you feel.

[01:06:00.480 --> 01:06:04.760]  Millions of people are going to get sick this winter from colds, flu, and other illnesses.
[01:06:04.760 --> 01:06:05.840]  Don't be one of them.

[01:06:30.960 --> 01:06:32.560]  other harmful pathogens.

[01:06:37.420 --> 01:06:41.560]  hundred times the effectiveness of colloidal or ionic silver solutions.
[01:06:41.560 --> 01:06:45.220]  The Science Digest Journal says silver is our mightiest germ fighter.
[01:06:45.220 --> 01:06:49.080]  It is virtually non-toxic and is emerging as a wonder of modern medicine.

[01:08:26.720 --> 01:08:27.720]  We are back.
[01:08:27.720 --> 01:08:33.320]  It is Monday, the 28th day of January 2013.
[01:08:33.320 --> 01:08:38.100]  Hard to believe the first month of 2013 is almost gone.
[01:08:38.100 --> 01:08:45.400]  And coming up, CBS News says it's time to, quote, give up on the Constitution.
[01:08:45.400 --> 01:08:49.700]  Senior Obama official says we're going to kill the dollar.
[01:08:49.700 --> 01:08:50.700]  That's a quote.
[01:08:50.700 --> 01:08:52.280]  We're going to be playing video of that.
[01:08:52.280 --> 01:08:58.400]  Act emails reveal Washington approved plan to stage chemical weapons attack in Syria.
[01:08:58.400 --> 01:09:03.400]  Obama administration complicit in war crime, question mark.
[01:09:03.400 --> 01:09:07.120]  Attack helicopters let loose with machine gun fire over Miami.
[01:09:07.120 --> 01:09:09.600]  That's up at infowars.com.
[01:09:09.600 --> 01:09:11.000]  This and much more.
[01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:17.200]  Piers Morgan in Politico declares that the best interview he ever had was Alex Jones
[01:09:17.200 --> 01:09:18.960]  and that this will be used to defeat gun owners.
[01:09:18.960 --> 01:09:20.820]  He said that January 17th.
[01:09:20.820 --> 01:09:25.520]  Now he's declaring they've lost today on his Twitter and that gun owners are all up in
[01:09:25.520 --> 01:09:26.520]  an uproar.
[01:09:26.520 --> 01:09:27.520]  Yeah, why?
[01:09:27.520 --> 01:09:28.960]  Why didn't you have me back, Piers?
[01:09:28.960 --> 01:09:30.840]  Why aren't all the other shows having me on it?
[01:09:30.840 --> 01:09:32.160]  I'm so discrediting.
[01:09:32.160 --> 01:09:36.900]  You see, Paul Revere rode and screamed arms to arms.
[01:09:36.900 --> 01:09:37.900]  The redcoats are coming.
[01:09:37.900 --> 01:09:42.520]  He didn't go up there and say, nah, nah, hi, I know it sounds like a conspiracy theory,
[01:09:42.520 --> 01:09:46.120]  but the government's corrupt, you know.
[01:09:46.120 --> 01:09:49.400]  That's why it was a big victory, ladies and gentlemen, and I'm not putting perfume on
[01:09:49.400 --> 01:09:50.400]  a pig.
[01:09:50.400 --> 01:09:53.680]  I analyzed it, what happened, and decided I did the right thing.
[01:09:53.680 --> 01:09:57.640]  I prayed to God that I would do the best thing when I went in there against the enemy.
[01:09:57.640 --> 01:10:03.400]  And I told him after the interview, I said, you are an enemy and I will rout you out.
[01:10:03.400 --> 01:10:08.880]  You are a gangster thug and you will be defeated and all of you are on notice.
[01:10:08.880 --> 01:10:12.360]  Those CNN crew, multiple women were crying and freaking out.
[01:10:12.360 --> 01:10:16.400]  The men were hyperventilating and I said, I know who you are, traitors.
[01:10:16.400 --> 01:10:18.880]  I marched out of there.
[01:10:18.880 --> 01:10:23.440]  I didn't go in there and, you're so big, you've got such a big set, you're so powerful.
[01:10:23.440 --> 01:10:27.360]  We're not gonna get this country back playing patty cake.
[01:10:27.360 --> 01:10:30.080]  Does the dawn of Chicago Emmanuel play nice?
[01:10:30.080 --> 01:10:34.400]  He's saying, we're gonna lean on gun manufacturers and banks, we're just gonna shut them down
[01:10:34.400 --> 01:10:36.000]  outside of law.
[01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:43.120]  That's called torturous interference, racketeering by any yardstick.
[01:10:43.120 --> 01:10:45.040]  This is what we're talking about.
[01:10:45.040 --> 01:10:47.020]  This is what we're dealing with.
[01:10:47.020 --> 01:10:50.280]  And we're not going to get our country back playing patty cake.
[01:10:50.280 --> 01:10:52.320]  We're gonna get it back going, we know who you are.
[01:10:52.320 --> 01:10:54.560]  We know foreign banks have hijacked the government.
[01:10:54.560 --> 01:10:57.240]  We know you're illegitimate and don't stage something.
[01:10:57.240 --> 01:11:00.780]  And even if something happens, giving up our rights doesn't keep us safe.
[01:11:00.780 --> 01:11:03.160]  So don't you blow something up and blame it on us.
[01:11:03.160 --> 01:11:04.440]  We're watching you.
[01:11:04.440 --> 01:11:09.200]  You understand that?
[01:11:09.200 --> 01:11:11.320]  We're watching you and we know what's going on.
[01:11:11.320 --> 01:11:13.020]  The time for games is over.
[01:11:13.020 --> 01:11:15.200]  People probably notice I'm a lot more serious on air.
[01:11:15.200 --> 01:11:17.620]  I used to joke around, have a little bit more fun on air.
[01:11:17.620 --> 01:11:20.880]  People notice behind the scenes, there's no more games.
[01:11:20.880 --> 01:11:24.320]  This is game time, folks, in the battle for the Republican humanity.
[01:11:24.320 --> 01:11:27.140]  This is a life and death situation.
[01:11:27.140 --> 01:11:30.520]  This is the real world, this isn't a game.
[01:11:30.520 --> 01:11:32.240]  I'm not up here playing games.
[01:11:32.240 --> 01:11:33.960]  I know where I live.
[01:11:33.960 --> 01:11:35.920]  I know where the world is.
[01:11:35.920 --> 01:11:37.320]  I know where I stand.
[01:11:37.320 --> 01:11:41.320]  I know how dark the times are.
[01:11:41.320 --> 01:11:45.440]  That's just some of what's coming up, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:11:45.440 --> 01:11:52.380]  DHS buys 7,000 full auto assault rifles, calls them personal defense weapons.
[01:11:52.380 --> 01:11:54.200]  Government wants to exempt itself from gun laws.
[01:11:54.200 --> 01:11:58.600]  All government officials will no longer be called servants, but officials exempt from
[01:11:58.600 --> 01:12:04.580]  all their laws, from insider trading to senators with quote underage prostitutes.
[01:12:04.580 --> 01:12:05.800]  They're above the law.
[01:12:05.800 --> 01:12:10.560]  And ABC News goes and talks to the senator in an interview never asked about the underage
[01:12:10.560 --> 01:12:19.000]  prostitutes or the convicted sex offender for child abuse working in his office.
[01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:21.480]  I mean, these people are sick.
[01:12:21.480 --> 01:12:24.120]  Let's go ahead and talk to Danny in Tennessee.
[01:12:24.120 --> 01:12:25.120]  You're on the air, Danny.
[01:12:25.120 --> 01:12:26.120]  Thank you for holding.
[01:12:26.120 --> 01:12:28.320]  Hey, thanks, Alex, for taking my call.
[01:12:28.320 --> 01:12:30.040]  I've been listening about 15 years.
[01:12:30.040 --> 01:12:32.900]  I think I called you once, maybe 12 years ago.
[01:12:32.900 --> 01:12:37.800]  But anyway, no, I'm right with you as far as Piers Morgan.
[01:12:37.800 --> 01:12:40.720]  I was very pleased the way you handled that.
[01:12:40.720 --> 01:12:43.480]  I'm actually calling about a situation this morning.
[01:12:43.480 --> 01:12:45.920]  I went to Walmart to pick up a 10-22.
[01:12:45.920 --> 01:12:46.920]  They happen to have one.
[01:12:46.920 --> 01:12:51.840]  I hold a valid New York driver's license and I live in New York and in Tennessee.
[01:12:51.840 --> 01:12:57.520]  I went there and they were doing the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation check and the person
[01:12:57.520 --> 01:13:02.960]  on the other line was giving my salesperson a hard time saying that he has a New York
[01:13:02.960 --> 01:13:04.560]  driver's license.
[01:13:04.560 --> 01:13:07.800]  He cannot buy a Ruger 10-22 in Tennessee.
[01:13:07.800 --> 01:13:08.800]  I thank the Lord.
[01:13:08.800 --> 01:13:14.420]  The woman was thinking and she looked at her chart and said, well, apparently you're wrong
[01:13:14.420 --> 01:13:19.440]  or this chart is wrong because New York is a valid place to, you know, I can sell to
[01:13:19.440 --> 01:13:20.960]  someone from New York and Tennessee.
[01:13:20.960 --> 01:13:22.320]  They went back and forth.
[01:13:22.320 --> 01:13:26.800]  She actually argued with the guy and finally the guy gave in and let me purchase the TBL.
[01:13:26.800 --> 01:13:27.800]  Let me stop you.
[01:13:27.800 --> 01:13:33.940]  I've talked to two different gun dealers and then I'm also getting emails from gun dealers
[01:13:33.940 --> 01:13:39.160]  and I should wipe the phones out later and open it up for FFL, federal firearms licensee
[01:13:39.160 --> 01:13:40.160]  dealers.
[01:13:40.160 --> 01:13:43.760]  And I'm trying to get these guys on air, but obviously they get intimidated.
[01:13:43.760 --> 01:13:44.760]  The ATF comes in.
[01:13:44.760 --> 01:13:45.760]  They did this last year.
[01:13:45.760 --> 01:13:50.040]  Remember when we were given some documents that were then made national news?
[01:13:50.040 --> 01:13:59.720]  Were ATF in five western states, Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, Nevada, and California just
[01:13:59.720 --> 01:14:00.720]  said outside of law.
[01:14:00.720 --> 01:14:01.720]  They tried to pass the law.
[01:14:01.720 --> 01:14:02.720]  They couldn't.
[01:14:02.720 --> 01:14:07.040]  They put letters in and the ATF visited saying you will report to us and open a criminal
[01:14:07.040 --> 01:14:13.160]  file when someone buys more than two rifles or handguns at one time or two or more.
[01:14:13.160 --> 01:14:16.200]  And again, they're already when you call in, it's already in the next system.
[01:14:16.200 --> 01:14:17.300]  There's already a record.
[01:14:17.300 --> 01:14:19.280]  They just wanted to test outside the law.
[01:14:19.280 --> 01:14:25.280]  Now they say that and the ATF is now going in saying you're going to stop selling semi-autos
[01:14:25.280 --> 01:14:30.080]  or we're going to go through all your records and find a T that's not crossed and I that's
[01:14:30.080 --> 01:14:31.080]  not dotted.
[01:14:31.080 --> 01:14:32.520]  By the way, they arrest you for that.
[01:14:32.520 --> 01:14:35.960]  That's why now they're all going to computerize systems so you can't make a mistake because
[01:14:35.960 --> 01:14:37.640]  if there's a mistake, it'll kick it back.
[01:14:37.640 --> 01:14:40.840]  But then that also computerizes it makes it easier for the ATF.
[01:14:40.840 --> 01:14:42.680]  That's the problem.
[01:14:42.680 --> 01:14:47.220]  And so they're harassing good gun dealers, but they've ordered to give guns to drug cartels
[01:14:47.220 --> 01:14:50.680]  so they can blame all gun dealers and it's how this mafia operates.
[01:14:50.680 --> 01:14:53.520]  And so what you're experiencing is happening to everybody.
[01:14:53.520 --> 01:14:56.080]  I've talked to people who went to gun shows personally.
[01:14:56.080 --> 01:15:01.860]  I've had the calls where you're buying a clip, a 10 round clip, and they follow you out the
[01:15:01.860 --> 01:15:05.960]  door and ask you who you are like the clips that we're the new criminal class.
[01:15:05.960 --> 01:15:12.640]  The entire Homeland Security apparatus, they admit behind the scenes for a decade was going
[01:15:12.640 --> 01:15:13.840]  to be for us.
[01:15:13.840 --> 01:15:14.840]  People are like, how did you know that?
[01:15:14.840 --> 01:15:18.100]  You say Homeland Security is not for gun owners because it always was.
[01:15:18.100 --> 01:15:21.280]  It was never about Al Qaeda that these offshore banks run.
[01:15:21.280 --> 01:15:22.280]  I'm sorry.
[01:15:22.280 --> 01:15:23.280]  Go ahead.
[01:15:23.280 --> 01:15:24.280]  Oh, no, no.
[01:15:24.280 --> 01:15:25.280]  Continue on.
[01:15:25.280 --> 01:15:28.480]  I'm not definitely listening and I just, I was curious if other people have experienced
[01:15:28.480 --> 01:15:29.480]  that.
[01:15:29.480 --> 01:15:34.080]  But I am thankful for this woman who actually thought and defended what was true.
[01:15:34.080 --> 01:15:43.520]  Well, Emanuel and all of them have said Schumer, Emanuel, Pelosi, who's the other one?
[01:15:43.520 --> 01:15:49.160]  Bloomberg have all said, we're going to put pressure on the manufacturers and the sellers
[01:15:49.160 --> 01:15:50.880]  to just voluntarily comply.
[01:15:50.880 --> 01:15:57.440]  Well, that's like the TSA ran checkpoints all over downtown Austin last Thursday.
[01:15:57.440 --> 01:16:01.220]  And then I got reports again over the weekend, but I can't just stake out Lamar.
[01:16:01.220 --> 01:16:03.600]  That's where they're doing it.
[01:16:03.600 --> 01:16:06.080]  And on South Lamar and then up into the city.
[01:16:06.080 --> 01:16:07.640]  And they just show up with Austin police.
[01:16:07.640 --> 01:16:12.480]  They have guns and they say, lay your bags out, get out of your car, get off the train,
[01:16:12.480 --> 01:16:14.640]  and we're gonna search you.
[01:16:14.640 --> 01:16:16.240]  And then when they go, what about the Fourth Amendment?
[01:16:16.240 --> 01:16:18.600]  They told the news, well, they volunteered.
[01:16:18.600 --> 01:16:26.040]  Armed men have their lights on and armed feds with guns on their hip and guns on their,
[01:16:26.040 --> 01:16:30.640]  they wear them commando style on their thigh.
[01:16:30.640 --> 01:16:35.220]  Armed men, sure, I would say, Fourth Amendment, you can't search my bag.
[01:16:35.220 --> 01:16:37.560]  But most people literally cower.
[01:16:37.560 --> 01:16:40.180]  They're the royalty, we're the scum.
[01:16:40.180 --> 01:16:43.280]  And it's just color of law, gangsterism.
[01:16:43.280 --> 01:16:49.820]  America is, government at every level is teaming up against us, swarming us, dominating us.
[01:16:49.820 --> 01:16:53.480]  State police pull you over in Texas now, and I'm getting reports all over the country.
[01:16:53.480 --> 01:16:57.920]  They go, got any firearms in your car, no, but if I did, they're legal.
[01:16:57.920 --> 01:16:58.920]  What do you got at home?
[01:16:58.920 --> 01:17:00.120]  Where do you live?
[01:17:00.120 --> 01:17:01.720]  Is this your right driver's license?
[01:17:01.720 --> 01:17:06.420]  And folks, they're doing this to, again, totally clean cut people.
[01:17:06.420 --> 01:17:10.880]  They got a database on you, they know you have no record, and they look at you like
[01:17:10.880 --> 01:17:13.240]  a criminal cuz you're the milk cow.
[01:17:13.240 --> 01:17:18.200]  They get promoted, all of it's being recorded, they have a microphone on their tie.
[01:17:18.200 --> 01:17:22.760]  And it's reviewed, they get promoted if they savage the American people.
[01:17:22.760 --> 01:17:26.360]  I mean, this is a revolution of secret police activity.
[01:17:26.360 --> 01:17:29.600]  Cuz you know, we have the article last week, they're announcing and they're putting in
[01:17:29.600 --> 01:17:34.440]  audio in major hotels saying, if you see bags, please call the police.
[01:17:34.440 --> 01:17:39.880]  The waiters are on a computer system at the hotel bars and restaurants, they're listening
[01:17:39.880 --> 01:17:40.880]  to you.
[01:17:40.880 --> 01:17:45.920]  They're filling out data, when the bartender's talking to you now, I mean, this is in press
[01:17:45.920 --> 01:17:48.480]  releases, they're filling out FBI files on you.
[01:17:48.480 --> 01:17:50.360]  I mean, it's stazzy out in the open.
[01:17:50.360 --> 01:17:53.640]  I mean, do you understand the magnitude of this, sir?
[01:17:53.640 --> 01:17:56.040]  I certainly do, I certainly do.
[01:17:56.040 --> 01:18:00.160]  And I like to tell your listeners, too, that we have a group of people, we're friends,
[01:18:00.160 --> 01:18:03.200]  and we've listened to you for quite a while.
[01:18:03.200 --> 01:18:05.880]  And apparently, we're conspiracy theorists, too.
[01:18:05.880 --> 01:18:10.680]  But actually, I look at it as we're conspiracy realists, because for the Christians out there,
[01:18:10.680 --> 01:18:13.400]  Satan is the biggest conspirator of them all.
[01:18:13.400 --> 01:18:20.440]  When you have a massive amount of people who are against Christ, they side with Satan,
[01:18:20.440 --> 01:18:22.560]  and he is a conspirator from day one.
[01:18:22.560 --> 01:18:29.580]  So I like how our opponents make us look crazy, we're actually not.
[01:18:29.580 --> 01:18:35.360]  But another thing I'd like to state is, when it looks like there's no hope and that we
[01:18:35.360 --> 01:18:39.800]  are a minority, it doesn't matter, because I believe that the Lord is truly on our side.
[01:18:39.800 --> 01:18:45.440]  He is on the side of truth and righteousness, and as long as we uphold that, he will bless
[01:18:45.440 --> 01:18:46.440]  that.
[01:18:46.440 --> 01:18:50.760]  Amen to that, brother, and I appreciate your call, Danny.
[01:18:50.760 --> 01:18:56.120]  Yeah, the feds were involved two years ago in a sting at the Austin gun shows to try
[01:18:56.120 --> 01:19:04.280]  to shut them down, so the city could, outside of law, order the private owners of different
[01:19:04.280 --> 01:19:12.360]  facilities to not let them have gun shows there, racketeering.
[01:19:12.360 --> 01:19:16.200]  And it turned out they would send in illegal aliens with real driver's license the state
[01:19:16.200 --> 01:19:22.040]  had given them, and then they would present real licenses, fraudulently given by the state,
[01:19:22.040 --> 01:19:23.520]  a fraud.
[01:19:23.520 --> 01:19:26.840]  And then private sellers, their private gun, not a gun dealer, you have to have a federal
[01:19:26.840 --> 01:19:30.720]  license to be a gun dealer, they would do the private sale, people selling off their
[01:19:30.720 --> 01:19:32.440]  gun collection.
[01:19:32.440 --> 01:19:36.760]  And then they would put that person in jail with a kangaroo jury that was so ignorant,
[01:19:36.760 --> 01:19:39.880]  saying, well, he sold an illegal alien, yeah, but he had a real license.
[01:19:39.880 --> 01:19:43.600]  The judge would say, you are to convict.
[01:19:43.600 --> 01:19:45.920]  I mean, this is the racketeering.
[01:19:45.920 --> 01:19:50.000]  They are gonna persecute and fill the prisons with gun owners, and turning your guns in
[01:19:50.000 --> 01:19:51.000]  won't help.
[01:19:51.000 --> 01:19:55.320]  They're gonna take everything, pension funds, stocks, bonds, this is a criminal takeover.
[01:19:55.320 --> 01:20:00.700]  We'll be right back with more of your call, stay with us.
[01:20:00.700 --> 01:20:05.680]  Looking back on 2012, we ask ourselves, how did we ever survive from natural disasters
[01:20:05.680 --> 01:20:10.260]  like Hurricane Sandy and the devastating summer drought to the family hardships brought on
[01:20:10.260 --> 01:20:12.120]  by a disastrous economy?
[01:20:12.120 --> 01:20:14.840]  Our hearts go out to those that have lost everything.
[01:20:14.840 --> 01:20:18.640]  At e Foods Direct, we hear from customers every day that are fortunate enough to weather
[01:20:18.640 --> 01:20:21.560]  life's storm by having a supply of food on hand.
[01:20:21.560 --> 01:20:26.100]  After Hurricane Sandy, Danny from New York City wrote, almost all the grocery stores
[01:20:26.100 --> 01:20:30.920]  are closed, but I managed to get my e Foods just in time to be able to help my sister
[01:20:30.920 --> 01:20:31.920]  and niece.
[01:20:31.920 --> 01:20:35.720]  It is better to be prepared 10 years too early than one day too late.
[01:20:35.720 --> 01:20:37.960]  I can warn you, but I can't feed you.
[01:20:37.960 --> 01:20:40.320]  Heed the warnings and do what Alex has done.

[01:21:00.360 --> 01:21:02.600]  It's time for a home security quiz.
[01:21:02.600 --> 01:21:03.600]  Answer this.
[01:21:03.600 --> 01:21:07.800]  What effective home security device is smaller than a coffee cup, fakes out burglars into
[01:21:07.800 --> 01:21:12.400]  thinking someone is home at your house while you're away, plugs into any wall outlet, is
[01:21:12.400 --> 01:21:16.680]  recommended by many police departments and sells for less than $35?
[01:21:16.680 --> 01:21:19.280]  Yes, it's fake TV.
[01:21:19.280 --> 01:21:23.680]  This year, about one in every 50 U.S. homes will have a break-in, with burglars usually
[01:21:23.680 --> 01:21:28.120]  picking the easy target, a dark house that looks like no one is home.
[01:21:28.120 --> 01:21:33.040]  Fake TV is a small electronic security device that makes it look like someone is home watching
[01:21:33.040 --> 01:21:36.120]  TV by simulating the light from a real TV.
[01:21:36.120 --> 01:21:39.120]  It's like a lamp on a timer, but far more convincing.
[01:21:39.120 --> 01:21:43.840]  And for only $34.95, fake TV could be the difference between coming home to a secure
[01:21:43.840 --> 01:21:46.120]  house or one that's been ransacked.
[01:21:46.120 --> 01:21:51.400]  Go to faketv.com or call 1-877-5FAKETV.
[01:21:51.400 --> 01:21:55.040]  That's 877-532-5388.
[01:21:55.040 --> 01:21:57.280]  Or go to faketv.com.
[01:21:57.280 --> 01:22:00.280]  Fake TV, the burglar deterrent.
[01:22:00.280 --> 01:22:04.240]  Do you know how much the dollar has lost in its value against other currencies in the
[01:22:04.240 --> 01:22:05.640]  last 90 days?
[01:22:05.640 --> 01:22:10.800]  Ever think about how inflation will change your life, your savings, your retirement plans?
[01:22:10.800 --> 01:22:14.680]  Remember inflation in Zimbabwe, Argentina, the Weimar Republic?
[01:22:14.680 --> 01:22:20.240]  Put another way, who cares if your investments go up 10%, but you lose 40% of your purchasing
[01:22:20.240 --> 01:22:21.240]  power.
[01:22:21.240 --> 01:22:24.960]  Gold is the only monetary asset as no one else's liability.
[01:22:24.960 --> 01:22:27.840]  Gold still buys the same amount of stuff it always did.
[01:22:27.840 --> 01:22:30.280]  Gold does not require trust in a third party.
[01:22:30.280 --> 01:22:31.900]  You can possess it in your hand.
[01:22:31.900 --> 01:22:33.360]  You can take it with you.
[01:22:33.360 --> 01:22:34.480]  Gold is real money.
[01:22:34.480 --> 01:22:35.800]  Gold is honest money.
[01:22:35.800 --> 01:22:38.120]  My name is Daniel Larson from Midas Resources.
[01:22:38.120 --> 01:22:42.420]  To find out how you can protect your savings and roll over your IRA funds into precious
[01:22:42.420 --> 01:22:49.160]  metals accounts, please call me at 800-686-2237, extension 134.
[01:22:49.160 --> 01:22:54.560]  That's 800-686-2237, extension 134.
[01:22:54.560 --> 01:23:00.040]  800-686-2237, extension 134.
[01:23:00.040 --> 01:23:01.360]  Don't throw away leftovers.
[01:23:01.360 --> 01:23:06.000]  Instead, throw all your leftovers, vegetable peels, eggshells, coffee grounds, pizza crusts,
[01:23:06.000 --> 01:23:07.560]  and more into the Bokashi.
[01:23:07.560 --> 01:23:11.140]  If you love to garden and compost but don't like the hassle of turning a compost bin or
[01:23:11.140 --> 01:23:15.880]  the smell, then check out the EM Bokashi Food Waste Recycling System from Tereganics.
[01:23:15.880 --> 01:23:20.080]  Finally a way to recycle all your food and plant waste safely and effectively and stop
[01:23:20.080 --> 01:23:21.440]  using fertilizers.
[01:23:21.440 --> 01:23:23.840]  The EM Bokashi Food Waste Recycling System.
[01:23:23.840 --> 01:23:28.160]  Rather than decomposition, the Bokashi system uses fermentation to break down waste so it
[01:23:28.160 --> 01:23:32.640]  takes less time to create nutrient-dense humus for crops or gardens with no turning and no
[01:23:32.640 --> 01:23:34.000]  obnoxious odors.
[01:23:34.000 --> 01:23:38.600]  To learn more and order your Bokashi online, visit Tereganics.com and click on the orange
[01:23:38.600 --> 01:23:39.600]  button.

[01:23:47.960 --> 01:23:51.480]  That's 866-369-3678.
[01:23:51.480 --> 01:23:54.800]  Recycle all your food wastes in about six weeks with the Bokashi Food Waste Recycling

[01:23:56.800 --> 01:23:57.800]  Tereganics.
[01:23:57.800 --> 01:24:24.600]  Your life's getting better.
[01:24:27.800 --> 01:24:36.000]  You know, sometimes I do special reports and things, and I'm very calm and people like
[01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:37.000]  it.
[01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:38.840]  But you can't argue with success.
[01:24:38.840 --> 01:24:44.600]  I genuinely start hyperventilating and getting upset on air when I realize this is all real.
[01:24:44.600 --> 01:24:46.740]  I've studied history.
[01:24:46.740 --> 01:24:48.800]  It's not hard to figure out what's happening.
[01:24:48.800 --> 01:24:52.920]  The government now admits it's totally illegitimate and above the law.
[01:24:52.920 --> 01:24:53.920]  And we're in trouble.
[01:24:53.920 --> 01:24:57.340]  I mean, we're in trouble.
[01:24:57.340 --> 01:25:01.320]  Everywhere you go, the corporations are training all their employees to be spies.
[01:25:01.320 --> 01:25:04.040]  And they're not looking for all kind of terrorist folks.
[01:25:04.040 --> 01:25:06.040]  They're looking for the American people.
[01:25:06.040 --> 01:25:12.520]  They're looking for patriots and constitutionalists and veterans and gun owners and conservatives.
[01:25:12.520 --> 01:25:19.520]  And this is outrageous that they're calling us Nazis and criminals and baby killers, collectively
[01:25:19.520 --> 01:25:23.120]  putting the guilt on us to try to have a purge against us.
[01:25:23.120 --> 01:25:27.080]  This is just the setup when they blow up some federal buildings and blame it on us or stage
[01:25:27.080 --> 01:25:28.080]  a mass shooting.
[01:25:28.080 --> 01:25:32.640]  This is just the beginning, and that's what I wanna relay to you.
[01:25:32.640 --> 01:25:38.160]  The globalists are planning to use a civil war that they'll call terrorism, they'll call
[01:25:38.160 --> 01:25:44.920]  us terrorist if we resist going to FEMA camps, as a political cover to their implosion of
[01:25:44.920 --> 01:25:45.920]  the economy.
[01:25:45.920 --> 01:25:48.160]  Now, I don't think they're gonna get away with it.
[01:25:48.160 --> 01:25:52.040]  I think they're gonna back off because the police aren't buying it.
[01:25:52.040 --> 01:25:55.260]  That's why we've always targeted the police for the truth.
[01:25:55.260 --> 01:26:00.240]  Because knowing that tyranny will come to your door in a uniform.
[01:26:00.240 --> 01:26:02.480]  And so we don't want this war to happen.
[01:26:02.480 --> 01:26:06.760]  And the police aren't stupid, they know what I'm saying is true and real.
[01:26:06.760 --> 01:26:09.800]  Some of them are dumb, that's why they're trying to hire dumber and dumber people, that's
[01:26:09.800 --> 01:26:10.800]  on record.
[01:26:10.800 --> 01:26:13.260]  Still, it isn't gonna work.
[01:26:13.260 --> 01:26:15.880]  But we've got to put the maximum effort out now.
[01:26:15.880 --> 01:26:19.880]  Anti New World Order in New York, you're on the air, thanks for holding.
[01:26:19.880 --> 01:26:25.960]  Yes, Alex, I just want to say thank you for basically what you've done for the truth movement.
[01:26:25.960 --> 01:26:33.000]  I've been following you for a long time, I started on 1310 a.m. in Rochester, New York.
[01:26:33.000 --> 01:26:38.800]  You actually inspired me to start a blog, and last year we hit over 100,000 views.
[01:26:38.800 --> 01:26:43.920]  It's the Anti New World Order party, and we are making connections all over the world.
[01:26:43.920 --> 01:26:51.800]  I believe that with what you've done, you set a fire in the hearts and the minds of
[01:26:51.800 --> 01:26:53.800]  American patriots.
[01:26:53.800 --> 01:26:54.800]  And I believe-
[01:26:54.800 --> 01:26:56.440]  But that's what you've got to do, and that's what you're doing.
[01:26:56.440 --> 01:27:02.860]  All of us are here like incendiary bombs to set brush fires in the minds of men and women.
[01:27:02.860 --> 01:27:07.640]  We are the resistance, we are Paul Revere, we are victory.
[01:27:07.640 --> 01:27:08.640]  Absolutely.
[01:27:08.640 --> 01:27:16.120]  And you've inspired me that I'm actually going to start an online or a radio program, and
[01:27:16.120 --> 01:27:19.520]  we're getting sponsors, and it's all because of your work.
[01:27:19.520 --> 01:27:24.520]  Exactly, just attack the enemy on every front, info war them, use their own corruption against
[01:27:24.520 --> 01:27:27.000]  them, discredit them, expose their hypocrisy.
[01:27:27.000 --> 01:27:31.560]  I mean, that should be instant discrediting, that they're going to be exempt from the gun
[01:27:31.560 --> 01:27:32.560]  laws we're under.
[01:27:32.560 --> 01:27:36.320]  And then they say in the news, well, we need guns to protect ourselves.
[01:27:36.320 --> 01:27:41.800]  I mean, look at Charlie Sheen going, well, I've changed my mind about guns, no one needs
[01:27:41.800 --> 01:27:43.200]  to own these.
[01:27:43.200 --> 01:27:45.400]  Besides, I've got bodyguards.
[01:27:45.400 --> 01:27:49.360]  Well, yeah, you make $3 million a week, Charlie, come on.
[01:27:49.360 --> 01:27:55.600]  I mean, it's the disconnect of the ruling class living in their bubble.
[01:27:55.600 --> 01:27:57.600]  God bless you, my friend, good to hear from you.
[01:27:57.600 --> 01:28:00.360]  Let's talk to Phil in North Carolina, you're on the air.
[01:28:00.360 --> 01:28:02.720]  Alex, how are you doing?
[01:28:02.720 --> 01:28:07.480]  I just want to say thanks for everything you're doing, and me and my wife, we pray for you
[01:28:07.480 --> 01:28:08.480]  and your family.
[01:28:08.480 --> 01:28:11.760]  And that's a three-quarter, Alex, it's hard to break.
[01:28:11.760 --> 01:28:12.760]  You there?
[01:28:12.760 --> 01:28:15.040]  Yes, I'm listening to you.
[01:28:15.040 --> 01:28:20.760]  I just want to set the board for the media, and it's so far left.
[01:28:20.760 --> 01:28:25.840]  It just rips apart anything that has to do with this country.
[01:28:25.840 --> 01:28:31.400]  And it's really, it's hard, it's my job, it's how I support my family.
[01:28:31.400 --> 01:28:35.360]  When I've talked to them, they got me down as I'm a loony to them.
[01:28:35.360 --> 01:28:38.520]  And when I try to explain to them- Yeah, yeah, they dictate reality.
[01:28:38.520 --> 01:28:40.240]  They're the ones that are delusional, though.
[01:28:40.240 --> 01:28:45.360]  Uh-huh, you're funny, you think America's scary with secret arrest and checkpoints and
[01:28:45.360 --> 01:28:47.600]  bankrupting dollar and everything.
[01:28:47.600 --> 01:28:52.040]  Uh-huh, you think there's something wrong with our government funding Al-Qaeda publicly.
[01:28:52.040 --> 01:28:54.920]  What a weirdo.
[01:28:54.920 --> 01:28:57.020]  I mean, you ought to feel sorry for those people.
[01:28:57.020 --> 01:29:00.380]  They're nothing but cowards who do whatever they're told.
[01:29:00.380 --> 01:29:04.040]  And actually, it's one thing to go along with something cuz you got to, that's bad enough.
[01:29:04.040 --> 01:29:10.080]  But they actually buy into the lie because they think you just put on your political
[01:29:10.080 --> 01:29:15.400]  beliefs like a suit of clothes, that it's about whatever feels good to them, and that
[01:29:15.400 --> 01:29:16.400]  way leads to destruction.
[01:29:16.400 --> 01:29:21.160]  I'm gonna come back to you, Phil, cuz I wanna hear what it's like to work in a establishment
[01:29:21.160 --> 01:29:22.160]  media.
[01:29:22.160 --> 01:29:23.280]  And again, let's break their terms.
[01:29:23.280 --> 01:29:24.880]  They're not liberals.
[01:29:24.880 --> 01:29:27.480]  Thomas Jefferson is a liberal.
[01:29:27.480 --> 01:29:29.640]  George Washington was a liberal.
[01:29:29.640 --> 01:29:31.440]  Alex Jones is a liberal.
[01:29:31.440 --> 01:29:33.000]  Ron Paul's a liberal.
[01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:34.560]  Lou Rockwell's a liberal.
[01:29:34.560 --> 01:29:36.840]  G. Edward Griffin's a liberal.
[01:29:36.840 --> 01:29:41.760]  Keep our money, keep our property, keep our families, worship what god we want, do what
[01:29:41.760 --> 01:29:43.760]  we want.
[01:29:43.760 --> 01:29:45.640]  That's liberal.
[01:29:45.640 --> 01:29:50.000]  Liberal is not having the government tell you how much soft drinks you can drink.
[01:29:50.000 --> 01:29:51.360]  We're on the march.
[01:29:51.360 --> 01:29:53.760]  The empire's on the run.
[01:29:53.760 --> 01:30:02.720]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:02.720 --> 01:30:09.000]  If you want an American company with American products made by Americans, here is the Cal
[01:30:09.000 --> 01:30:10.840]  Ben Soap Company.

[01:30:41.600 --> 01:30:43.440]  This is an amazing deal.
[01:30:43.440 --> 01:30:48.660]  You can save thousands of dollars and you will love the way real soap makes you feel.

[01:31:01.020 --> 01:31:05.720]  You prepare by purchasing gold, food, and firearms, but if you don't have a home security
[01:31:05.720 --> 01:31:10.480]  system then you're missing a critical weapon in your arsenal for home protection.
[01:31:10.480 --> 01:31:14.200]  When you're sleeping or away from home, who's watching out for intruders?

[01:31:15.920 --> 01:31:20.360]  It's a new do it yourself home security system that is completely wireless.

[01:32:03.560 --> 01:32:08.560]  The prognosis for the entire planetary economic system runs from bad to worse.
[01:32:08.560 --> 01:32:14.580]  The globalist model is to shut down societies and starve patriots out until they acquiesce
[01:32:14.580 --> 01:32:15.580]  to the global takeover.
[01:32:15.580 --> 01:32:21.560]  That's why we've assembled the most vital and important preparedness items at InfoWarsShop.com.
[01:32:21.560 --> 01:32:25.240]  These are items that I did research on, that I personally use.

[01:33:43.480 --> 01:33:48.140]  Now coming out now perfectly timed with the shootings all of it.
[01:33:48.140 --> 01:33:52.340]  This is all scripted to a great extent.
[01:33:52.340 --> 01:33:57.600]  And that's why I'm up here and I'm so focused and so hardcore because yes ladies and gentlemen
[01:33:57.600 --> 01:34:00.080]  they could easily set me up easily kill me.
[01:34:00.080 --> 01:34:04.360]  I've been physically attacked years ago I get death threats I've had dirty tricks you
[01:34:04.360 --> 01:34:09.600]  wouldn't believe but I pray to God.
[01:34:09.600 --> 01:34:14.220]  And I know I'm in God's hands and again that doesn't mean I'm some goody two shoes who's
[01:34:14.220 --> 01:34:20.680]  up here saying hey I'm this big great Christian I listen I'm a bad man.
[01:34:20.680 --> 01:34:21.760]  My flesh is bad.
[01:34:21.760 --> 01:34:24.280]  I mean I have bad thoughts.
[01:34:24.280 --> 01:34:29.080]  I think about you know literally gouging my enemy's eyes out sometimes but I repent of
[01:34:29.080 --> 01:34:34.600]  that and I want to be a good person and I don't want to hate my fellow man.
[01:34:34.600 --> 01:34:36.040]  The world is nasty.
[01:34:36.040 --> 01:34:37.040]  The world is hard.
[01:34:37.040 --> 01:34:39.080]  The world is bad.
[01:34:39.080 --> 01:34:43.840]  The Madison Avenue shows us the red carpets and the models and the helicopters and the
[01:34:43.840 --> 01:34:49.520]  money and we imagine that that's some wonderful heaven up there and our lives are dirt and
[01:34:49.520 --> 01:34:50.660]  squalor.
[01:34:50.660 --> 01:34:57.680]  It's not true folks recognizing beauty recognizing justice standing up for justice and helping
[01:34:57.680 --> 01:35:04.000]  others and not hating each other is what will bring us to the next level and fulfill you.
[01:35:04.000 --> 01:35:09.280]  No amount of money or power will do that and all the studies show that.
[01:35:09.280 --> 01:35:16.280]  What will fulfill you is the truth and it doesn't mean that sometimes you don't get
[01:35:16.280 --> 01:35:17.540]  mad at your family.
[01:35:17.540 --> 01:35:20.960]  It doesn't mean sometimes you don't get mad at your boss or your employees.
[01:35:20.960 --> 01:35:26.840]  It means that you understand the stimuli and the manipulation by the social engineers on
[01:35:26.840 --> 01:35:33.660]  record from Edward Bernays 80 years ago to Joseph Goebbels 70 years ago to right through
[01:35:33.660 --> 01:35:36.000]  to modern propaganda 101.
[01:35:36.000 --> 01:35:41.160]  It's all about divide and conquer and play us off against each other.
[01:35:41.160 --> 01:35:49.560]  I mean you turn on MSNBC it's like Kurt Vonnegut satire of a futuristic bizarro world where
[01:35:49.560 --> 01:35:53.760]  all they do is go everyone knows people that don't like the UN are racist and gun owners
[01:35:53.760 --> 01:35:59.440]  are scum and hate black people yeah and evil men had to be dealt with hey good news the
[01:35:59.440 --> 01:36:08.060]  family's falling apart I mean you tune into it you're like what is this and they're unhappy
[01:36:08.060 --> 01:36:20.280]  soulless mercenaries I mean I've been in MSNBC I've been in Fox I've been in CNN I've been
[01:36:20.280 --> 01:36:28.320]  in you name it and I've been around the people and man they are absolutely alone.
[01:36:28.320 --> 01:36:32.240]  They're all fake they're all trying to act powerful around each other everyone's trying
[01:36:32.240 --> 01:36:37.400]  to not say anything show that so that they don't you know put themselves out there so
[01:36:37.400 --> 01:36:41.960]  that someone can use it against them it's and then they go home to plastic husbands
[01:36:41.960 --> 01:36:51.360]  and plastic wives they have plastic kids that commit suicide and they're totally empty I've
[01:36:51.360 --> 01:36:56.160]  got the opposite problem I'm gonna just be honest with you I mean I I'm so tuned into
[01:36:56.160 --> 01:37:04.680]  reality it is like unspeakably incredible and painful at the same time and I'm not saying
[01:37:04.680 --> 01:37:09.640]  I'm at some high level I'm just at a basic human level I go read the writings of the
[01:37:09.640 --> 01:37:13.920]  founders I read the writings of philosophers I go read the writings of great literature
[01:37:13.920 --> 01:37:20.600]  and I see the same thoughts I've personally had that they had and and and and and and
[01:37:20.600 --> 01:37:27.520]  then surpassing my understanding I'm nothing special except in a day and age of universal
[01:37:27.520 --> 01:37:42.200]  deceit telling the truth is a revolutionary act as Eric Blair said I love the sound of
[01:37:42.200 --> 01:37:49.920]  thunder going through the studio walls I just want to hike in the woods in the rain oh you
[01:37:49.920 --> 01:37:59.480]  know that's that's that's that's one reason that's one reason that I really get mad and
[01:37:59.480 --> 01:38:05.000]  hate the globalist because they do steal our future they don't just steal monetarily they
[01:38:05.000 --> 01:38:11.640]  just don't steal culturally they steal our time and our energy serving their system the
[01:38:11.640 --> 01:38:17.480]  fact that we have to spend time on them and talk about all the stuff they're doing that's
[01:38:17.480 --> 01:38:23.120]  why if you attack them with a glancing blow and attack them within their paradigms you
[01:38:23.120 --> 01:38:27.840]  only add power to them it's designed but you attack them from outside the box of how it's
[01:38:27.840 --> 01:38:34.120]  a false construct of how it's an artificial society a stage that they train us to basically
[01:38:34.120 --> 01:38:42.120]  be players upon when you realize that they do not like it when you go into the CNN studios
[01:38:42.120 --> 01:38:49.800]  and they're dirty and pockmarked and gross and all the people look demoralized good I
[01:38:49.800 --> 01:38:55.800]  was in CNN I don't know a decade ago and then three years ago and it didn't look like that
[01:38:55.800 --> 01:39:01.160]  I was in the exact same studios rotting it's like your soul is rotting it's good to see
[01:39:01.160 --> 01:39:06.220]  the enemy rotting it's good to see you weak look at info wars growing look at the rest
[01:39:06.220 --> 01:39:14.780]  of the alternative media growing getting stronger good it's war and if they destroy me I'm personally
[01:39:14.780 --> 01:39:20.520]  I'm not happy about that but it's part of the war it's part of the real the real thing
[01:39:20.520 --> 01:39:28.680]  the tree being watered it's holy it's strengthening the species it's honorable it's a struggle
[01:39:28.680 --> 01:39:36.440]  it's real I went and saw a film I forget the name of you guys look it up I actually brought
[01:39:36.440 --> 01:39:39.520]  you in the ticket stub so you could know the name of it it's like flight of the monarchs
[01:39:39.520 --> 01:39:44.260]  I think fly to the butterflies I went and saw it it's got UN propaganda in it of course
[01:39:44.260 --> 01:39:49.520]  but that's like one percent of it very good film in fact I may go see it again with my
[01:39:49.520 --> 01:39:57.360]  children I they went with me Saturday with my wife probably the best nature documentary
[01:39:57.360 --> 01:40:02.200]  just for its simplicity but story I've ever seen because it was touching to me how the
[01:40:02.200 --> 01:40:07.400]  four generations of monarchs start I'm not going to say where it starts because that's
[01:40:07.400 --> 01:40:11.120]  the I mean obviously anybody that knows science knows where it starts for your kids I won't
[01:40:11.120 --> 01:40:21.080]  tell them it starts let's just say starts around Texas and then goes all the way up
[01:40:21.080 --> 01:40:28.400]  into northern Canada and it takes four generations to get to Canada and then there's like a b-52
[01:40:28.400 --> 01:40:33.800]  version of the monarch that's like four times the size of a regular one that makes the long
[01:40:33.800 --> 01:40:42.960]  flight back then waits all winter flies back to Texas from the south and then lays its
[01:40:42.960 --> 01:40:49.840]  eggs and dies incredible and how that monarch uses electromagnetics to fly sometimes you
[01:40:49.840 --> 01:40:57.080]  know ten thousand feet in the air electromagnetic off the Sun and off the poles and the meridians
[01:40:57.080 --> 01:41:02.600]  and scans in flying everything calculated just perfectly they know to fly the three
[01:41:02.600 --> 01:41:10.000]  thousand miles four thousand miles whatever it is and this incredible death race to get
[01:41:10.000 --> 01:41:14.800]  down there and then four more generations to get all the way up to the top of the mountain
[01:41:14.800 --> 01:41:26.600]  and then back down again and it's that struggle and we're in that generation you know it's
[01:41:26.600 --> 01:41:34.520]  like the third coming the book that is that the name David Knight did a piece on you know
[01:41:34.520 --> 01:41:41.040]  that breaks down these cycles in in in humans and I was thinking of our generation the fourth
[01:41:41.040 --> 01:41:45.640]  turning excuse me the fourth turning teleprompter free here and I was just thinking about that
[01:41:45.640 --> 01:41:52.400]  how all the generations come and go and this is going to be not just from the fourth turning
[01:41:52.400 --> 01:41:56.960]  but other sociologists anthropologists historians this is the prime zone the globalists say
[01:41:56.960 --> 01:42:02.760]  that this next ten years is going to decide the next thousand I mean this is the most
[01:42:02.760 --> 01:42:09.560]  mega important point in all of human development this is everything on the line this is it
[01:42:09.560 --> 01:42:16.160]  I'm sorry I it's not that I'm a good guy I am not fulfilled being a greedy bastard and
[01:42:16.160 --> 01:42:21.080]  by greedy it's not even about money I am not fulfilled you know just to be able to sell
[01:42:21.080 --> 01:42:25.760]  out to the system and be chauffeured around and have bodyguards and live in New York or
[01:42:25.760 --> 01:42:33.220]  LA and prance around at parties with a bunch of fake people you know shelling out that
[01:42:33.220 --> 01:42:38.640]  I'm a winner I made it to the top you made it to the top of a pile of skulls meant to
[01:42:38.640 --> 01:42:47.800]  the top of a latrine you meant to the top of a spider hole I want to see humanity make
[01:42:47.800 --> 01:42:55.760]  it to the stars and to really develop and I that's why I'm not worried about being killed
[01:42:55.760 --> 01:43:00.600]  or destroyed or set up whatever I'm just a monarch butterfly man just like everybody
[01:43:00.600 --> 01:43:05.440]  else I just want my species to go on look at all of what our species has done those
[01:43:05.440 --> 01:43:11.160]  monarchs are picking up electromagnetic information in their DNA they're an antenna and so are
[01:43:11.160 --> 01:43:16.520]  we folks and my antenna says fight the New World Order it says I'm not going along with
[01:43:16.520 --> 01:43:21.880]  this everything I've got is to navigate me against these people I don't need all the
[01:43:21.880 --> 01:43:26.960]  high-tech computers and programming and fancy systems the globalist have got I just got
[01:43:26.960 --> 01:43:32.120]  to follow my spirit God gave me that literally resonates with my DNA and I got it all right
[01:43:32.120 --> 01:43:37.800]  here man I've got an electrochemical computer and and billions of cells all in Congress
[01:43:37.800 --> 01:43:44.620]  together literally that can recognize the beauty of the night sky and the beauty of
[01:43:44.620 --> 01:43:49.680]  my innocent children and the beauty of my wife and the beauty of literature and art
[01:43:49.680 --> 01:43:56.280]  and philosophy and friendship and everything honorable I don't just know when the sun's
[01:43:56.280 --> 01:44:02.620]  coming up I don't just wake up as the Sun is about to crest because I my soul literally
[01:44:02.620 --> 01:44:08.120]  picks up its electromagnetic pulse as it passes over the rock of the planet blocking it I
[01:44:08.120 --> 01:44:14.020]  literally pick up what's good and evil I have discernment that's all it is we are a billion
[01:44:14.020 --> 01:44:20.120]  times with that monarch butterfly is a little tiny creature that can fly four thousand miles
[01:44:20.120 --> 01:44:25.440]  and navigate electromagnetically do you know what you are and these atheists tell you you
[01:44:25.440 --> 01:44:29.920]  don't have a soul these atheists tell you you're nothing special that you're crap that
[01:44:29.920 --> 01:44:34.680]  humans are ugly you hear it all the time we're a joke we're no good all day they tell you
[01:44:34.680 --> 01:44:41.440]  that because it's a lie ladies and gentlemen it's a lie this species is meant to go to
[01:44:41.440 --> 01:44:47.080]  the stars this species isn't it hasn't even gone to our next phase yet of what God has
[01:44:47.080 --> 01:44:51.480]  prepared for us eye has not seen ear has not heard and the preacher's jobs out there is
[01:44:51.480 --> 01:44:57.360]  to keep you from knowing just how incredible you are we are made in the image of the creator
[01:44:57.360 --> 01:45:03.480]  of the universe look at how more advanced we are than that butterfly look at what we've
[01:45:03.480 --> 01:45:10.760]  already built this is nothing this is nothing and evil are people malfunctioning and people
[01:45:10.760 --> 01:45:16.800]  giving into destructive tendencies to dominate like cancer in a body you so-called elites
[01:45:16.800 --> 01:45:22.480]  are unhappy and you think making us unhappy will make you happy you're inbred your disease
[01:45:22.480 --> 01:45:27.440]  you're hateful you're unhappy so you want to do you want to poison us you want to pump
[01:45:27.440 --> 01:45:32.080]  heavy metals into us to damage our DNA you think bringing the species down will raise
[01:45:32.080 --> 01:45:38.480]  you up you will never rise bringing others down yeah I know you're coming down fast with
[01:45:38.480 --> 01:45:47.380]  your miles above me I got it how about we all rise and then you can be rising fast miles
[01:45:47.380 --> 01:45:55.360]  above us that's real power that's real power real power is saying I am now one with the
[01:45:55.360 --> 01:46:01.040]  universe and its creator I step in to the time-space continuum I follow my programming
[01:46:01.040 --> 01:46:07.880]  but I have free will I accept my programming I accept what I am I accept it and I telegraph
[01:46:07.880 --> 01:46:14.240]  my information into the future through my species that is the magic of the universe
[01:46:14.240 --> 01:46:19.960]  that is the meaning of life that is everything that ever was is and will be that is your
[01:46:19.960 --> 01:46:26.200]  destiny those of you that serve darkness many of you there's still time to turn back there's
[01:46:26.200 --> 01:46:32.840]  still time to join humanity in the great race the great march towards our destiny but you're
[01:46:32.840 --> 01:46:38.280]  not going to partake of that destiny I'll assure you kneeling to the dark side you evil
[01:46:38.280 --> 01:46:43.960]  people think you have knowledge of the dark side if you really knew the true knowledge
[01:46:43.960 --> 01:46:50.480]  of the creator of the universe if you even had the spark the inkling of God if you even
[01:46:50.480 --> 01:46:56.480]  had one micron of that fire you would then have knowledge of all the evil and you wouldn't
[01:46:56.480 --> 01:47:03.360]  want nothing to do with it you dark practitioners think you have knowledge of evil I don't even
[01:47:03.360 --> 01:47:09.360]  want to look into the knowledge I have of it you have not seen it or I will assure you
[01:47:09.360 --> 01:47:15.340]  you would not be running so happily towards it let's go to your phone calls I apologize
[01:47:15.340 --> 01:47:19.440]  I said I'd take more but I'm on a roll today because I'm really it's just understanding
[01:47:19.440 --> 01:47:25.120]  how serious all this is this is what goes on in my mind 24 7 fill in North Carolina
[01:47:25.120 --> 01:47:32.120]  tell your media story go ahead what it's like working inside a group suppressing the human
[01:47:32.120 --> 01:47:42.120]  potential well Alex they just they basically laugh at us we're too far out there and you
[01:47:42.120 --> 01:47:47.400]  know Alex they're going blind through a storm with a smile on their face they don't even
[01:47:47.400 --> 01:47:53.180]  know what's going on Alex I mean they're clueless and it's all they care about is their football
[01:47:53.180 --> 01:47:59.120]  game and their six-pack of beer and I know that I have nothing against football and but
[01:47:59.120 --> 01:48:04.160]  now it's stolen their manhood their manhood is raising their children strong being good
[01:48:04.160 --> 01:48:07.720]  teaching their children how to fix things teaching their children how to stand up for
[01:48:07.720 --> 01:48:13.800]  themselves not waddling around talking about the team all day it's stolen everything from
[01:48:13.800 --> 01:48:20.620]  us you're right Alex and I just you know that's all I really had to say thank you very much
[01:48:20.620 --> 01:48:24.840]  for everything you're doing Alex uh don't thank me don't thank me yeah you're on the
[01:48:24.840 --> 01:48:31.840]  air go ahead it's you brother is um you know I'm a Christian and uh my Christian friends
[01:48:31.840 --> 01:48:37.280]  have always given me a hard time I'm a member of a gun range uh always go shooting they
[01:48:37.280 --> 01:48:43.160]  always ask me why did I like to go shooting and uh you know what I told them and then
[01:48:43.160 --> 01:48:47.440]  they asked me if I'm a Christian why don't I depend on God to protect me and I told them
[01:48:47.440 --> 01:48:52.800]  I said God hasn't called me to be a martyr yet he hasn't called me to allow a car full
[01:48:52.800 --> 01:48:57.440]  of people to pull up my front yard get out come in shoot me in the head rape my three
[01:48:57.440 --> 01:49:03.480]  daughters shoot them and then or whatever I have take it with him he hasn't called me
[01:49:03.480 --> 01:49:08.880]  to do that yet he may someday do that to me Alex but right now he's told me to defend
[01:49:08.880 --> 01:49:14.520]  my property in my household in my family that's where I'm at right now Alex well listen listen
[01:49:14.520 --> 01:49:19.280]  a hundred years ago the Rockefellers with the National Council of Churches about 60
[01:49:19.280 --> 01:49:24.000]  years ago with the World Council of Churches I guess like 65 times flying they set these
[01:49:24.000 --> 01:49:31.440]  up and the churches got paid off and and brought in to be uh charities not under 501c3 and
[01:49:31.440 --> 01:49:36.800]  others not churches and so pretty much all the churches are saying turn your guns in
[01:49:36.800 --> 01:49:41.480]  now I don't care if they're Catholic Protestant Methodist I mean you know whatever it is they're
[01:49:41.480 --> 01:49:47.440]  state run basically clergy response teams these people call themselves Americans our
[01:49:47.440 --> 01:49:53.440]  country was born out of the preachers across the spectrum saying this is a tyranny government's
[01:49:53.440 --> 01:49:57.980]  not God government's abusing us we have a right and a duty to resist it the entire Bible
[01:49:57.980 --> 01:50:04.120]  is the prophets different ways sometimes physical sometimes with information resisting corrupt
[01:50:04.120 --> 01:50:09.800]  governments okay and and not worshiping the God of the state not worshiping the king but
[01:50:09.800 --> 01:50:15.520]  worshiping God and so these people that say you shouldn't be armed trust in God God gave
[01:50:15.520 --> 01:50:21.620]  you a brain gone God gave you all of this to protect yourself and you know look at God
[01:50:21.620 --> 01:50:28.520]  telling Israel get up and defend yourself look at that is so evil to sit there and say
[01:50:28.520 --> 01:50:35.640]  Christians should known guns I mean I see preachers on TV now saying the the early church
[01:50:35.640 --> 01:50:42.640]  was wrong to not worship Saturn and being thrown the lions in Rome so I mean look those
[01:50:42.640 --> 01:50:52.200]  are cowardly demons or you know they may just be deceived people but listen I wouldn't be
[01:50:52.200 --> 01:50:57.260]  going to a church where they say guns are bad God bless you my friend wow we're gonna

[01:53:01.320 --> 01:53:06.240]  Hey there Frank Bates here have you heard about the weird device that could wipe out
[01:53:06.240 --> 01:53:12.960]  280 million Americans this is really scary stuff defense experts warn that this odd device
[01:53:12.960 --> 01:53:17.980]  poses the gravest threat we've ever known in fact just a few weeks ago former speaker
[01:53:17.980 --> 01:53:21.940]  of the house Newt Gingrich wrote an op-ed piece for the Washington Post warning about
[01:53:21.940 --> 01:53:26.800]  this deadly threat I can't believe that more people aren't talking about this it may be
[01:53:26.800 --> 01:53:31.220]  because the liberals and the government are trying to cover it up that's why my friend
[01:53:31.220 --> 01:53:37.320]  just created a free video at weirddevice.com that exposes this threat and blows the doors
[01:53:37.320 --> 01:53:43.600]  off the conspiracy go watch the shocking video at weirddevice.com right now to discover exactly
[01:53:43.600 --> 01:53:48.560]  what it is plus discover the number one way you and your family can survive this deadly
[01:53:48.560 --> 01:53:53.780]  attack I'm not sure how long this video be online so go to weirddevice.com before it's
[01:53:53.780 --> 01:54:16.920]  gone forever again that's weirddevice.com
[01:54:16.920 --> 01:54:23.920]  got this story linked up at infowars.com set for takeoff Britain's deadly super drone that
[01:54:23.920 --> 01:54:30.920]  picks its own targets but experts warn plane could mark the start of robot wars yeah the
[01:54:30.920 --> 01:54:37.020]  Pentagon said back in the 70s that by 2010 they plan to have half the Air Force be robot
[01:54:37.020 --> 01:54:42.340]  drone and humans can do it pretty much whatever we put our minds to at a certain point and
[01:54:42.340 --> 01:54:48.620]  guess what by 2010 half of the Air Force was drone by 2020 they plan to have over 90% of
[01:54:48.620 --> 01:54:55.020]  it be drone but the Pentagon totals got something like 30,000 predators totaled one of the branches
[01:54:55.020 --> 01:55:00.980]  I think it's Air Force had some ridiculous amount like 18,000 of those and this amazing
[01:55:00.980 --> 01:55:07.740]  new drone systems similar to what the US is launching it's a system that picks and kills
[01:55:07.740 --> 01:55:16.420]  on its own and see then the globalist aren't going to need humans anymore the goal is to
[01:55:16.420 --> 01:55:21.900]  have robots working on robots working on robots with robot trucks and trains that even bring
[01:55:21.900 --> 01:55:27.300]  the parts in from the other factories and then humans that will oversee some of it but
[01:55:27.300 --> 01:55:32.420]  almost all engineers will tell you now computer engineers electrical engineers that no one
[01:55:32.420 --> 01:55:37.380]  knows how the microchip works by themselves it's all these experts together no one I mean
[01:55:37.380 --> 01:55:42.820]  it's already like something like 1600 times smaller than it was just 30 40 years ago 35
[01:55:42.820 --> 01:55:50.540]  years ago the the size of the so-called etching the wiring it's amazing and it's going to
[01:55:50.540 --> 01:55:55.260]  get more and more advanced and that's why the globalist are laughing they can have for
[01:55:55.260 --> 01:56:01.420]  a dollar in a few years a little robot with a weapon system that kills you with you a
[01:56:01.420 --> 01:56:07.660]  shot designed to only kill you with your DNA sequence that comes into your house at night
[01:56:07.660 --> 01:56:14.220]  by in fact biologically it can even be biological not even metal bites you and then you die
[01:56:14.220 --> 01:56:18.300]  the clothes are coming out where they'll have nanotech vaccines which actually re-engineer
[01:56:18.300 --> 01:56:22.580]  your brain bill gates has announced that and they say don't worry you're not going to be
[01:56:22.580 --> 01:56:27.420]  stressed anymore we've decided humans are designed wrong you're not supposed to get
[01:56:27.420 --> 01:56:31.940]  upset you're not going to be upset anymore this is going to inject you with a virus that
[01:56:31.940 --> 01:56:37.620]  goes in and eats areas of your brain and gives you a selective lobotomy just google brain
[01:56:37.620 --> 01:56:42.000]  eating vaccines you'll see a video I did two years ago on the subject or startpage.com
[01:56:42.000 --> 01:56:49.100]  you can find it there so anyways I'm ranting this is the type of stuff we're talking about
[01:56:49.100 --> 01:56:55.820]  but humans are going to beat this okay but the smart meters spying on us the electromagnetics
[01:56:55.820 --> 01:57:00.400]  all the major new brands coming out have systems the smart meters dial into and then surveil
[01:57:00.400 --> 01:57:05.940]  you and the CIA chief brags yeah we're putting microphones in all the new dishes and dishwashers
[01:57:05.940 --> 01:57:12.300]  dryers computers there's nothing you can do we're watching you but still I'm a conspiracy
[01:57:12.300 --> 01:57:17.260]  theorist because I told you 15 years ago MIT said that was the plan now what happens I'm
[01:57:17.260 --> 01:57:22.380]  even worse you see because the yuppies are like he's still bad it's not you know Alex
[01:57:22.380 --> 01:57:27.500]  is still bad okay so he's right it's good to have them watching us that's not bad it's
[01:57:27.500 --> 01:57:31.820]  good to have the laptops the school issues watching us it's good to have the NSA spying
[01:57:31.820 --> 01:57:36.420]  it's good to have the government running al-qaeda it's good to list gun owners as terrorists
[01:57:36.420 --> 01:57:42.900]  I'm going to turn my guns in to prove I'm I'm see they're scared deep down and so they
[01:57:42.900 --> 01:57:47.860]  submit to the system we're going to go to break and come back and go to John in Pennsylvania

[02:00:35.420 --> 02:00:43.320]  in the economy he's watching at prisonplanet.tv welcome sir thank you Alex I took the red
[02:00:43.320 --> 02:00:50.180]  toe a couple months ago and I'm a happy man god bless you happy inside but aware of too
[02:00:50.180 --> 02:01:00.220]  much I think all right I'm a Legionnaire and American Legion magazine coming in February
[02:01:00.220 --> 02:01:07.220]  has an article not made in America now according to this military times reports although DoD
[02:01:07.220 --> 02:01:18.460]  is required to purchase clothing and shoes 100% made in America they're coming from China
[02:01:18.460 --> 02:01:23.940]  and I think that might be a big part of the problem why we have no money because nobody
[02:01:23.940 --> 02:01:28.580]  could nobody here is working and we should be doing this like in World War II World War
[02:01:28.580 --> 02:01:39.300]  I we have two representatives are leading an effort representative Michael Michard Democrat
[02:01:39.300 --> 02:01:46.900]  from Maine and Duncan Hunter Republican from California and absolutely this is how wide
[02:01:46.900 --> 02:01:55.720]  open we are did you know the components for the B-2 bomber and missile systems for nuclear
[02:01:55.720 --> 02:02:02.500]  submarines are made in China and other areas on record most the military hardware is made
[02:02:02.500 --> 02:02:09.620]  overseas now it's just put together here this has been a long-term strategic plan where
[02:02:09.620 --> 02:02:16.080]  we give them worthless dollars then they buy real infrastructure with it this is how you
[02:02:16.080 --> 02:02:21.500]  get the u.s. conquered by Communist China the insiders went over there they put Malin
[02:02:21.500 --> 02:02:28.340]  in 49 always had deals with him always had deals with the Communist in China not so much
[02:02:28.340 --> 02:02:32.260]  Russia that was early on but the Russians doubled across the globalist for a while they
[02:02:32.260 --> 02:02:38.980]  were just as bad but the point is is that yes I've seen the articles in fact guys will
[02:02:38.980 --> 02:02:44.000]  you print me that I meant to cover that a few weeks ago thank you in fact there's another
[02:02:44.000 --> 02:02:50.740]  one that the army is the Pentagon's pulling crosses out of chapels thank you but the issue
[02:02:50.740 --> 02:02:58.820]  is that think about it worthless dollars go out they still have value on the surface then
[02:02:58.820 --> 02:03:04.380]  the Chinese use it to buy up infrastructure and ports and but then nobody can have a real
[02:03:04.380 --> 02:03:09.540]  job here unless they're select globalist companies that work with China I mean that's just an
[02:03:09.540 --> 02:03:20.780]  economic takeover plan you know Nixon started all this when he went to China and that was
[02:03:20.780 --> 02:03:26.480]  the public oh we're gonna be friends now is it incredible yes yes it had been a setup
[02:03:26.480 --> 02:03:33.980]  since 49 is my point the u.s. hauled the bacon of the Chinese in World War two so they did
[02:03:33.980 --> 02:03:38.620]  whatever they were told and shank I checked was like hey help me and they said no you
[02:03:38.620 --> 02:03:44.060]  know the stories of them giving them firearms without the firing pen and stuff and shells
[02:03:44.060 --> 02:03:48.180]  without the powder in them that was that's all been declassified now our so-called government
[02:03:48.180 --> 02:03:53.060]  put Mao in who then killed tens of millions of his own people greatest mass murderer in
[02:03:53.060 --> 02:03:59.380]  history and you're absolutely on target what you say is the key to the globalist takeover
[02:03:59.380 --> 02:04:04.740]  program and you can see it all and while we were worried about Russia the whole time China
[02:04:04.740 --> 02:04:12.420]  was the one that was being set up for the takeover and now this gun thing comes up to
[02:04:12.420 --> 02:04:19.980]  steer our eyes away from everything else that's right very well said John are people waking
[02:04:19.980 --> 02:04:28.540]  up over there at the VFW American Legion American Legion yeah I purchase one of your hats so
[02:04:28.540 --> 02:04:34.340]  every time I go out of the house I'm wearing info words on my head people people will stop
[02:04:34.340 --> 02:04:39.220]  and ask me what it is and I've been trying to spread the word Alex well god bless you
[02:04:39.220 --> 02:04:43.180]  I can tell you love this country and you love the ideas of it and love the checks and balances
[02:04:43.180 --> 02:04:48.660]  that have made us wealthy and powerful but with that came the decadence of the wealth
[02:04:48.660 --> 02:04:53.940]  so now we're falling apart and yeah the CFR every month brags that they're selling us
[02:04:53.940 --> 02:05:02.740]  out to China not the Chinese people the Chinese government now that we have moved into the

[02:09:43.820 --> 02:09:48.180]  matera approaches bloomberg and asked in the spirit of gun control will you disarm your
[02:09:48.180 --> 02:09:52.620]  entire security team see that's what they that would say it discredits you to point
[02:09:52.620 --> 02:09:56.980]  out we have security that's hoping you stop bringing it up of course it doesn't discredit
[02:09:56.980 --> 02:10:01.620]  us that they get waivers from their own gun control laws and have private security that's
[02:10:01.620 --> 02:10:05.740]  what totally destroys them with the public so they're like that's why they freak out
[02:10:05.740 --> 02:10:11.660]  and rough him up bloomberg's reply uh you will get back to you and this is coming out

[02:10:20.460 --> 02:10:26.660]  what gangsters do why can you defend yourself but not the majority of americans matera asked
[02:10:26.660 --> 02:10:32.160]  as the mayor walks away look at the team of security you've got and you're an advocate
[02:10:32.160 --> 02:10:39.780]  for gun control so he's letting them walk away you don't do that to don carlioni boom
[02:10:39.780 --> 02:10:47.540]  security turns around cops out of their jurisdiction back you're about to get it and the video

[02:11:02.780 --> 02:11:07.340]  asked to see his photo id matera complies before asking is this standard procedure for
[02:11:07.340 --> 02:11:11.660]  the press wait wait wait it's standard procedure to be questioned members of the press the
[02:11:11.660 --> 02:11:15.160]  officer reaches inside his jacket and grabs a pen as if to write down the journalist's
[02:11:15.160 --> 02:11:20.620]  name you're going to write it down now ask matera oh no sorry says officer stockton video
[02:11:20.620 --> 02:11:24.700]  then cuts to the scene further down the street where officer stockman trailing matera once
[02:11:24.700 --> 02:11:30.140]  again can be heard saying mr matera sir do you have a date of birth it's none of your
[02:11:30.140 --> 02:11:34.900]  business what my date of birth is so again first they get the id out of their jurisdiction

[02:11:40.500 --> 02:11:45.460]  interview done in conjunction with talk radio networks is not the first time matera has
[02:11:45.460 --> 02:11:57.780]  received a treatment for asking liberal politicians tough questions and it just goes on there
[02:11:57.780 --> 02:12:04.220]  in 2011 vice president joe biden warned matera let's get it straight guy don't screw around
[02:12:04.220 --> 02:12:08.980]  with me when he confronted biden about the use of a rape reference when discussing republican
[02:12:08.980 --> 02:12:21.940]  opposition to obama's uh jobs bill the washington post uh covered that
[02:12:21.940 --> 02:12:26.460]  and again it's them all they're basically grabbing on him and stuff uh we'll go to some

[02:12:55.980 --> 02:13:00.500]  thing that i would really like to see you do alex is i'd like to have you inform all
[02:13:00.500 --> 02:13:06.420]  of these people out here how obama is giving away everything of value in america to the
[02:13:06.420 --> 02:13:13.380]  flippin chinese you know when i say the chinese alex let's go bk on those sobs because if
[02:13:13.380 --> 02:13:20.660]  we don't buddy gun up because that's where we're going i have i'm a veteran from vietnam
[02:13:20.660 --> 02:13:24.620]  i have stood on the mountain praying to god and unfortunately i have felt the winds of
[02:13:24.620 --> 02:13:29.940]  war again i did not want to feel those again i am darn near 60 years old but i'm ready
[02:13:29.940 --> 02:13:35.180]  to die for the bring them back the constitution that our forefathers died for and i hope the
[02:13:35.180 --> 02:13:40.660]  rest of your listeners feel the same way i do i know you woke me up in 2008 and i have
[02:13:40.660 --> 02:13:45.860]  probably brought more than 100 people more awake to your message well great job tim you
[02:13:45.860 --> 02:13:51.940]  know in my first film made in 97 america destroyed by design i show the cfr plans that are public
[02:13:51.940 --> 02:13:56.420]  that the chinese century doesn't mean the chinese people it means suicide nets and mass
[02:13:56.420 --> 02:14:00.860]  enslavement and forced organ harvesting but the globalists went and made a deal they put
[02:14:00.860 --> 02:14:06.260]  mao in they made the deal public in the 70s to have them have goods made so cheap nobody
[02:14:06.260 --> 02:14:11.620]  could compete in slave factories you name it to then leverage out business over here
[02:14:11.620 --> 02:14:16.060]  where only select globalists can do business with the chinese factories through the chinese
[02:14:16.060 --> 02:14:22.940]  communist party and now the chinese government's buying the roads the oil the infrastructure
[02:14:22.940 --> 02:14:27.860]  they're coming back with the dollars that are worthless once they devalue the dollar
[02:14:27.860 --> 02:14:33.420]  buying up everything okay and it's also again about deindustrialization it's an economic
[02:14:33.420 --> 02:14:41.320]  warfare operation the chinese people china could collapse anytime so it's either it takes
[02:14:41.320 --> 02:14:46.580]  over it knows that in a big bubble or it collapses so the globalists are trying to prop it up
[02:14:46.580 --> 02:14:51.300]  that's why they'll pay you know 22 billion dollars to ship the biggest general motors
[02:14:51.300 --> 02:14:56.420]  factories in the world to china last year starting two years ago cadillac and vault
[02:14:56.420 --> 02:15:00.700]  and others because that's the deal that's the globalist investments they all get the
[02:15:00.700 --> 02:15:06.300]  money off the top from that uh so the chinese people want freedom they're good people on
[02:15:06.300 --> 02:15:09.980]  average just like americans are good people you know i talk about the british government
[02:15:09.980 --> 02:15:13.660]  being corrupt i'm not bashing brits when i talk about the israeli government being corrupt
[02:15:13.660 --> 02:15:18.200]  i'm not bashing the general israelis or the average iranian is a good person who wants
[02:15:18.200 --> 02:15:23.420]  freedom it government tends to be bad throughout history founding fathers told us that history
[02:15:23.420 --> 02:15:29.140]  shows that you better keep government small uh but yeah i know this china issue i mean
[02:15:29.140 --> 02:15:32.960]  i remember military officers telling me 15 years ago the plan was to use chinese soldiers
[02:15:32.960 --> 02:15:39.420]  here and i'd be like what now they're talking in fema documents like nle09 about using foreign
[02:15:39.420 --> 02:15:45.640]  troops using chinese troops to disarm americans uh i mean it's just insane and the chinese
[02:15:45.640 --> 02:15:50.980]  government says take the americans guns i appreciate your call tim i mean it's it's
[02:15:50.980 --> 02:15:57.260]  it's it's just it's insane to have newsweek come out last week and say we need the communist
[02:15:57.260 --> 02:16:02.060]  chinese to tell us what to do we need piers morgan to tell us what to do in that article
[02:16:02.060 --> 02:16:07.260]  piers pressure and alex jones has to be dealt with let him prepare his flamethrower we're
[02:16:07.260 --> 02:16:14.280]  preparing for him and it's openly threatening and the article is it's good to have piers
[02:16:14.280 --> 02:16:22.820]  morgan a foreigner telling us what to do america is done get used to being run by china and
[02:16:22.820 --> 02:16:30.000]  the guy says it with pleasure and again people that say israel runs everything israel lobby
[02:16:30.000 --> 02:16:38.340]  is a is a big manipulator in there but i mean i've done my research the china lobby and
[02:16:38.340 --> 02:16:42.740]  the federal reserve lobby which is tied to israel is really at the top of the food chain
[02:16:42.740 --> 02:16:50.540]  that very writer at newsweek saying basically america's done and celebrating it and celebrating
[02:16:50.540 --> 02:16:57.680]  quote our waning power the guy basically wants to end israel i was reading his writings
[02:16:57.680 --> 02:17:04.180]  he has a book out about it it's just like it's just crazy i'm not saying i'm not saying
[02:17:04.180 --> 02:17:09.780]  i'm not even debating israel okay because that's a trap designed to be a trap i'm not
[02:17:09.780 --> 02:17:21.180]  stepping into it the point is newsweek gave this guy a whole section to run down israel
[02:17:21.180 --> 02:17:26.840]  and separately he's saying the chinese need to take over i mean it's just crazy and then
[02:17:26.840 --> 02:17:35.940]  israel selling our secrets to china my point of bringing that up is where is the continuity
[02:17:35.940 --> 02:17:38.740]  in this where do all these globalists think they're going to go once we're turned over
[02:17:38.740 --> 02:17:48.260]  to the communist chinese just very bizarre just very bizarre it's mainly just open the
[02:17:48.260 --> 02:17:52.660]  gates open the gates bring down our countries i'll sell out to you you know to the chinese
[02:17:52.660 --> 02:17:59.780]  it's just like falling before the communist chinese just groveling to them and he says
[02:17:59.780 --> 02:18:04.340]  it's good to get used to that they admit they're getting us used to foreigners telling us what
[02:18:04.340 --> 02:18:08.700]  to do it's like i wrote the article but from a different perspective he's admitting hey
[02:18:08.700 --> 02:18:13.220]  we're here to get you used to a world government and everything will be sacrificed for world
[02:18:13.220 --> 02:18:18.580]  government the u.s you name it england let's jam in another call here doris and tennessee
[02:18:18.580 --> 02:18:26.260]  you're on the air thanks for holding hey um i was listening to uh you know i'm a real
[02:18:26.260 --> 02:18:35.140]  big fan just like you i liked john kennedy and um but i was listening to a 1961 uh speech
[02:18:35.140 --> 02:18:43.220]  you made at the un where he called for global disarmament yes early on this is a great point
[02:18:43.220 --> 02:18:49.940]  he he pushed through state department memorandum 7277 it's a little 40-something page manual
[02:18:49.940 --> 02:18:55.180]  of memory serves it's online i've got original copies here in the office uh it's actually
[02:18:55.180 --> 02:19:02.180]  in those uh bernadine smith big files i don't know where we put those but the point is 7277
[02:19:02.180 --> 02:19:09.180]  says first all the individuals disarm then the militaries disarm except for paramilitary
[02:19:09.180 --> 02:19:14.080]  un garrisons of SWAT teams in every city and how they're going to disarm the police after
[02:19:14.080 --> 02:19:18.780]  they disarm us and yeah kennedy kind of bought into all that till he found out what it was
[02:19:18.780 --> 02:19:22.700]  really about then he pulled out of it i mean you know people were really chumps back then
[02:19:22.700 --> 02:19:28.460]  they didn't they didn't know all that we know go ahead uh that's what that might be you
[02:19:28.460 --> 02:19:35.220]  know the the good old boy club wasn't ready for that back then uh aka is a new world order
[02:19:35.220 --> 02:19:40.460]  so that might have bought into some of the reasons why they assassinated him yeah stay

[02:24:40.460 --> 02:24:46.820]  you were making uh go ahead okay the point i was making is i'd read a book called accessories
[02:24:46.820 --> 02:24:52.460]  after the fact that all the people that got killed after the assassination of john kennedy
[02:24:52.460 --> 02:24:59.980]  then i went to listen to a speech about in 1961 to the united nations and he talked about
[02:24:59.980 --> 02:25:05.860]  global disarmament it sounded a whole lot like obama and no no that's it but i mean
[02:25:05.860 --> 02:25:10.780]  kennedy the difference was kennedy actually did do some good things he got sold on it
[02:25:10.780 --> 02:25:15.940]  as a good idea but a year later he pulled out of all that a year later he he understood
[02:25:15.940 --> 02:25:21.380]  it was a con game uh he signed an order to abolish the fellow reserve i mean uh he didn't
[02:25:21.380 --> 02:25:25.720]  want to give nukes to israel he did a lot of things that made the power structure very
[02:25:25.720 --> 02:25:33.780]  very upset okay now now we have two uh people that represent us corker and lamar alexander
[02:25:33.780 --> 02:25:38.940]  and i've noticed they've been getting really popular lately with the president uh corker's
[02:25:38.940 --> 02:25:45.780]  from chattanooga chattanooga tennessee is the only place in a economic recovery around
[02:25:45.780 --> 02:25:54.020]  in that i see and um alexander walked out with the president the day of the inauguration
[02:25:54.020 --> 02:26:01.900]  i don't believe we'll ever have another uh honest election um in my lifetime and uh well
[02:26:01.900 --> 02:26:07.420]  no listen that's why the fix is in they've told republicans you vote for open borders
[02:26:07.420 --> 02:26:13.620]  you vote for uh all of this or you're never getting back into office and and that's why

[02:26:23.260 --> 02:26:28.740]  the illegals and then let them legalize their families and let them get welfare and again
[02:26:28.740 --> 02:26:33.700]  the goal isn't to actually empower people from mexico uh these people do contribute
[02:26:33.700 --> 02:26:36.180]  to the country well there's really two different types of immigrants there's the ones that
[02:26:36.180 --> 02:26:39.460]  come here and work and there's those that come here from mexico and just get on welfare
[02:26:39.460 --> 02:26:44.060]  and become gangsters and that seems to be the kind our government wants uh and it's
[02:26:44.060 --> 02:26:49.220]  just despicable god bless you man good to hear from you tona in uh arizona you're on
[02:26:49.220 --> 02:26:58.820]  the air hey alex uh i've been listening last year um i i actually was talking to my brother
[02:26:58.820 --> 02:27:06.300]  recently and uh you know i was telling him about what was happening about like the federal
[02:27:06.300 --> 02:27:12.260]  reserve and like how they're taking the gun the guns and everything and he didn't he didn't
[02:27:12.260 --> 02:27:19.420]  really believe me at first until he started talking to a marine uh from youtube this marine
[02:27:19.420 --> 02:27:23.660]  was talking about um what the same things you're talking about and what's happening
[02:27:23.660 --> 02:27:28.520]  but you don't have to believe me or the marine i have abc news admitting the army's training
[02:27:28.520 --> 02:27:34.300]  for house-to-house gun confiscation in america but i don't just believe abc news i have shot
[02:27:34.300 --> 02:27:41.840]  or been sent video let's not exaggerate a hundred times in the last 17 years of marines
[02:27:41.840 --> 02:27:47.540]  training to take american's guns the role players wear john deere hats and say this
[02:27:47.540 --> 02:27:53.580]  isn't right that's america you can't take my gun and they practice shooting you and
[02:27:53.580 --> 02:28:00.260]  homeland security naturalnews.com dhs by seven thousand full auto assault rifles the story's
[02:28:00.260 --> 02:28:05.360]  up at infowars.com as well calls them personal defense weapons on top of tens of thousands
[02:28:05.360 --> 02:28:10.340]  of other machine guns full auto and the 1.6 plus billion they've gotten more bullets it's
[02:28:10.340 --> 02:28:17.820]  like 1.6 and then a half million i guess 1.65 billion now i mean they're and that's in the
[02:28:17.820 --> 02:28:22.540]  last 14 months i mean they're they're arming and digging in like it's the end of the world
[02:28:22.540 --> 02:28:28.760]  i got a clip coming up where an obama administration official told a senior major fund manager
[02:28:28.760 --> 02:28:33.100]  very well respected that they're going to kill the dollar well no kidding we know that's
[02:28:33.100 --> 02:28:38.260]  their plan do you know what's going to happen when the dollar goes belly up yeah it's going
[02:28:38.260 --> 02:28:45.220]  to be chaos it's going to be real bad real bad the point i was getting is my brother
[02:28:45.220 --> 02:28:49.780]  he started from a different perspective one of you you know because the marines he saw
[02:28:49.780 --> 02:28:55.180]  it as a man that has fought a war and he said that my brother has said that oh well alice
[02:28:55.180 --> 02:29:00.220]  jones you know he hasn't been in the war but not not that i'm saying that or anything like
[02:29:00.220 --> 02:29:06.020]  that but he was basically he the marine kind of made him woke him up but so made me kind
[02:29:06.020 --> 02:29:12.240]  of thinking like oh i'm like uh alex jones right so i started kind of looking uh into

[02:38:31.820 --> 02:38:36.080]  shoot my mouth off i've sued people before i don't like it but when i gotta do it i gotta
[02:38:36.080 --> 02:38:40.220]  do it the austin cop saying you go through or you're arrested and then and then blowing
[02:38:40.220 --> 02:38:44.160]  up and then trying to get them to not let me fly that guy was just like looking at me
[02:38:44.160 --> 02:38:49.300]  like he wanted me to do something physical hey i got a big brain pal okay if i want to
[02:38:49.300 --> 02:38:54.940]  i'm gonna go get the federal suit perfected and sue you and take away your jet ski okay
[02:38:54.940 --> 02:38:59.060]  but you better know and better be lucky even though i was assaulted at that airport once
[02:38:59.060 --> 02:39:02.700]  by somebody you guys tried to set me up with i don't know if he not him particularly but
[02:39:02.700 --> 02:39:06.980]  that it was clearly a setup rob do saw it grabbing on me and threatening me some thug
[02:39:06.980 --> 02:39:11.940]  they had in there i didn't even let the police arrest him and they were ready to because
[02:39:11.940 --> 02:39:15.920]  i didn't want to deal with the trial and stuff i just said i forgive you in the name of jesus
[02:39:15.920 --> 02:39:20.280]  but i wanted it on record you did this it was all on surveillance tape the point is
[02:39:20.280 --> 02:39:23.560]  is that if i threaten to sue somebody you better believe it's being looked at right

[02:43:02.520 --> 02:43:08.600]  no no no there's no such thing as look close to nostra either you know back in the 50s what was
[02:43:08.600 --> 02:43:15.480]  it 51 52 they had organized crime hearings with jaeger hoover who they'd go you know give tens of
[02:43:15.480 --> 02:43:18.680]  thousands of dollars anytime he wanted to go gamble at the horse tracks the mafia would
[02:43:19.320 --> 02:43:24.920]  it was a famous way to pay people off and uh he said there's no such thing as organized crime
[02:43:24.920 --> 02:43:32.440]  and he used the term congressional record conspiracy theory that's right that's right
[02:43:33.640 --> 02:43:39.960]  the conspiracy theory i mean it's a game they play look i see through you it's a con game
[02:43:39.960 --> 02:43:46.600]  unbelievable okay on the jesuit thing uh the jesuits were set up what in was it portugal
[02:43:47.240 --> 02:43:54.200]  by what was his name liola uh and people obsess over is it the jews is it the jesuits is it the
[02:43:54.200 --> 02:44:00.760]  muslims is it the masons is it all big powerful organizations become corrupt and dominant the
[02:44:00.760 --> 02:44:08.840]  nazis modeled their system of control with the ss off the jesuits i'm not saying the jesuits
[02:44:08.840 --> 02:44:16.200]  taught them to be nazis they modeled the black uniforms and the power structure after uh the
[02:44:16.200 --> 02:44:23.000]  system the guys asking me about them what else is it and you cannot deny that now the jesuits who
[02:44:23.000 --> 02:44:29.800]  even took over the papacy for a while till it crushed it uh that the jesuits now today you're
[02:44:29.800 --> 02:44:35.640]  the pope promotes world government and catholics should uh you know really be concerned about how
[02:44:35.640 --> 02:44:40.760]  world government and new world order is being promoted by the muslims the catholics so many
[02:44:40.760 --> 02:44:45.560]  other groups but then it doesn't exist at the same time there's also a popular thing that people put
[02:44:45.560 --> 02:44:51.000]  out to sell books with zero proof or facts that i am a jesuit and it all started about seven years
[02:44:51.000 --> 02:44:56.760]  ago i sent emails by prominent people that put forward the jesuit only conspiracy saying you will
[02:44:56.760 --> 02:45:02.360]  have me on to promote my book or i will expose you as a jesuit now the way to get on the show is
[02:45:02.360 --> 02:45:07.800]  here's my book i think i'd be a great guest not you will have me on or i will expose you i i
[02:45:07.800 --> 02:45:14.040]  think they have a name for that i was like what kind of weirdness is this and um i have i mean
[02:45:14.040 --> 02:45:20.440]  my family are famous protestants uh and i've told the story a million times but no one cares it's
[02:45:20.440 --> 02:45:27.320]  easier to not have research or facts to just say alex's work is nothing i say he works for the pope
[02:45:27.320 --> 02:45:34.600]  so it's true and it's beyond bizarre and they don't apologize to me nothing they they bear
[02:45:34.600 --> 02:45:39.800]  false witness and they lie and i forgive them because that's that's what jesus christ you know
[02:45:39.800 --> 02:45:47.800]  as as you know my teacher and my god has has taught me to do um is to forgive petty people
[02:45:47.800 --> 02:45:56.600]  that are all screwed up um just amazing you know my ancestors came into texas and did not like to
[02:45:56.600 --> 02:46:01.080]  the fact that people were being forced to convert to catholicism to get mexican land grants and so
[02:46:01.080 --> 02:46:06.200]  my ancestor was william airs and david airs there was also a bunch of others very famous you know
[02:46:06.200 --> 02:46:10.200]  raise colonel travis's son the rest of it i'm not going to even get into my family in texas history
[02:46:10.200 --> 02:46:13.240]  because it's so over the top people wouldn't even believe it but you can actually there's been books
[02:46:13.240 --> 02:46:17.400]  written about it if you'd like uh in fact people gone and got my people didn't think i was who i
[02:46:17.400 --> 02:46:21.720]  said they went got my yearbooks they went and found somehow got my birth certificate which i
[02:46:21.720 --> 02:46:28.440]  guess is fine the real spelling of emmerich not the wrong one on wikipedia um and now everything
[02:46:28.440 --> 02:46:33.240]  else has the wrong spelling fans do it with wrong spelling so they give us the sites or facebook
[02:46:33.240 --> 02:46:39.240]  has the wrong name you can't change it uh but they again cointel pro i don't think that's what
[02:46:39.240 --> 02:46:46.040]  this is this is just opportunistic money making they always just put something out there that
[02:46:46.040 --> 02:46:52.520]  can't be proved or disproved completely to to to to demonize someone and make it about the person
[02:46:54.120 --> 02:46:58.200]  when it's not about alex jones the government's trying to take your guns
[02:46:59.320 --> 02:47:03.720]  the government's trying to get rid of the borders and legalize 30 million illegal aliens right now
[02:47:04.440 --> 02:47:09.320]  the government is trying to get rid of the bill of rights and constitution they're running tsa
[02:47:09.320 --> 02:47:16.760]  checkpoints in austin right now and i told you that was coming and i was a coot now where i live
[02:47:16.760 --> 02:47:22.840]  the army shows up at city events and the tsa is out there with guns searching people's bags
[02:47:22.840 --> 02:47:34.120]  illegally but it doesn't matter because i'm supposedly a pop-tart jesuit uh and uh again
[02:47:34.120 --> 02:47:41.400]  uh people don't fight tyranny they just they just they just say i'm bad i mean they've said for 15
[02:47:41.400 --> 02:47:47.800]  years that genesis gcnlive.com is owned by some saudi arabian when it's a hundred percent a
[02:47:47.800 --> 02:47:54.280]  different genesis they've accused genesis of being the porno magazine genesis ted anderson when he
[02:47:54.280 --> 02:48:02.040]  first started this network 16 years ago wanted to have a tv network later so he called the radio the
[02:48:02.040 --> 02:48:07.560]  beginning of it genesis and it's just mental illness and people say no you are owned by the
[02:48:07.560 --> 02:48:12.440]  saudi arabians it's just it's just made up but then they don't get upset about current tv that
[02:48:12.440 --> 02:48:19.640]  actually is run by the arabs now you see so that's how mass mental illness works all right so and
[02:48:19.640 --> 02:48:23.240]  that's fine not everybody's gonna wake up to the tyranny and actually get in the game against
[02:48:23.240 --> 02:48:27.320]  tyranny they're just gonna go down rabbit trails and you know this person's bad and that person's
[02:48:27.320 --> 02:48:32.920]  bad and sit around anointing who's bad and who's good all day and it's sad for me not because i'm
[02:48:32.920 --> 02:48:42.920]  being attacked but because it's sad because these people are just were never meant to have real
[02:48:42.920 --> 02:48:48.200]  discernment or to fight evil they're tools of corruption and don't even know it okay let's go
[02:48:48.200 --> 02:48:54.120]  to this clip here this is a senior obama official we're gonna go to this one first senior obama
[02:48:54.120 --> 02:49:02.600]  official we are going to kill the dollar and uh kyle bass who knows a thing or two about companies
[02:49:02.600 --> 02:49:07.640]  and finance recently spoke to a senior member of the obama administration about their planned
[02:49:07.640 --> 02:49:13.560]  solutions for fixing the u.s economy and bass is a top uh fund manager you know very well respected
[02:49:13.560 --> 02:49:18.520]  uh the answer shouldn't surprise you and let's go ahead and go to that clip now you're in charge
[02:49:18.520 --> 02:49:23.320]  you're in charge of this thing called the united states government budget and it gives you political
[02:49:23.320 --> 02:49:29.960]  and fiscal authority to do quote unquote the right thing yeah would you mark to market balance sheets
[02:49:29.960 --> 02:49:37.080]  today and create the economic downside that that would follow or would you put in place
[02:49:37.880 --> 02:49:44.280]  or attempt to put in place some kind of economic policies to get you to a better place down some
[02:49:44.280 --> 02:49:50.680]  theoretical road i mean how do you solve a problem where you're spending ten percent of you know
[02:49:50.680 --> 02:49:55.640]  you're running a 10 fiscal deficit you're not going to get growth in the absence of private
[02:49:55.640 --> 02:50:01.240]  sector credit demand so the government's idea right now is we're going to export our way out
[02:50:01.240 --> 02:50:07.000]  of this and when i asked a senior member of the obama administration last week how are we going
[02:50:07.000 --> 02:50:12.520]  to grow exports if we won't allow nominal wage deflation and he says we're just going to kill
[02:50:12.520 --> 02:50:18.600]  the dollar and i said okay more you mean um so that i mean that's the only answer and you that's
[02:50:18.600 --> 02:50:23.720]  a dead answer it's a dead answer but it's that's where that's where we're at but see folks that's
[02:50:23.720 --> 02:50:29.960]  the cover to all of this because they know nothing can ever compete with suicide factories with
[02:50:29.960 --> 02:50:35.480]  suicide nets up around them at the dorms no one can compete with forced abortions in the factory
[02:50:35.480 --> 02:50:39.960]  no one they've got regulations here where we can't even compete with mexico or india
[02:50:41.000 --> 02:50:47.400]  okay you know they pay to ship the jobs overseas this is a way all we had left was our dollar to
[02:50:47.400 --> 02:50:52.600]  buy all these goods that's going to go it's all been engineered it's all been planned out so the
[02:50:52.600 --> 02:50:58.120]  chinese money and the rothchild money and the globalist money can pour back in and buy everything
[02:50:58.120 --> 02:51:03.080]  up we're going to come back with another stunning clip this is alex jones with five good reasons you

[02:51:23.560 --> 02:51:29.000]  power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the
[02:51:29.000 --> 02:51:34.200]  problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of
[02:51:34.200 --> 02:51:38.760]  families lose their power from weather related onages number five a solar power generator

[02:54:30.440 --> 02:54:38.200]  and i i remember shooting video for martial law in 1999 actually for the film police state 2000
[02:54:39.480 --> 02:54:45.880]  and again people saw the footage and thought it was fake that i had hired the corona of the
[02:54:45.880 --> 02:54:52.200]  land in san francisco uh hovercraft helicopters it had to be computer no way marines were training
[02:54:52.200 --> 02:54:55.800]  to kill americans and take their guns you know they were doing interrogation where'd you get
[02:54:55.800 --> 02:55:02.200]  the gun the helmet oh i got it from san francisco i'm i'm part of the militia people said this can't
[02:55:02.200 --> 02:55:11.240]  be real they weren't ready in 1999 and then i was sent footage from all over the country of
[02:55:13.240 --> 02:55:17.880]  of the boy scouts like 12 year olds training coming out to the marines and going what are
[02:55:17.880 --> 02:55:22.040]  your parents have in the house well he's got three rifles and two handguns good job
[02:55:23.640 --> 02:55:26.200]  kids in white t-shirts riding around hebron maryland
[02:55:27.640 --> 02:55:31.800]  and then the marines go over with guns and say turn your cameras off i mean this is america
[02:55:33.480 --> 02:55:39.480]  and then i had the army try to set me up and it's so insane mike hanson saw it i mean who
[02:55:39.480 --> 02:55:45.640]  would believe i went to heb to brooksville florida and you're in the woods and a guy
[02:55:45.640 --> 02:55:49.320]  jumps out because you're trying to film the military do gun confiscation drills in the town
[02:55:49.320 --> 02:55:54.200]  and a guy jumps out and tries to set the woods on fire to blame you and you're like stomping it out
[02:55:54.200 --> 02:55:57.800]  and then having to grab the guy and say i'm gonna you know physically beat you up if you don't do
[02:55:57.800 --> 02:56:01.640]  this and then doombuggies show up and all this stuff and then you go talk to locals they go
[02:56:01.640 --> 02:56:05.400]  i've been told not to talk to you the army came door to door i mean it's like a movie
[02:56:05.400 --> 02:56:12.040]  folks the government is evil okay i tried to expose all this and they were ready to burn
[02:56:12.040 --> 02:56:22.120]  things down and blame me with special forces now the military isn't bad people i actually woke them
[02:56:22.120 --> 02:56:29.880]  up by doing that the point is is that we're in trouble listen to this on cbs news they have
[02:56:29.880 --> 02:56:35.560]  people on this is just this is just this weekend it's every day you see this saying it's time to
[02:56:35.560 --> 02:56:39.800]  give up on the constitution well that's nothing some of these shows bad mouth the founders
[02:56:39.800 --> 02:56:45.400]  these people are collaborators the full videos up at law professor on cbs says let's give up
[02:56:45.400 --> 02:56:52.520]  on the constitution here's that clip i've got a simple idea let's give up on the constitution
[02:56:52.520 --> 02:56:57.640]  how about you go to hell i know it sounds radical i know you're a traitor but it's really not i know
[02:56:57.640 --> 02:57:04.200]  i'm a sack of crap disobedience is as american as apple pie for example most of our greatest
[02:57:04.200 --> 02:57:10.680]  presidents jefferson lincoln wilson and both roosevelds had doubts about the constitution
[02:57:10.680 --> 02:57:15.720]  and many of them disobeyed it when it got in their way to be clear i don't think we should
[02:57:15.720 --> 02:57:21.400]  give up on everything in the constitution the constitution has many important and inspiring
[02:57:21.400 --> 02:57:26.600]  provisions that's enough but we should obey see see see this is the spin jefferson said it wasn't
[02:57:26.600 --> 02:57:32.360]  enough protections and so did the others lincoln was the one that went absolutely hog wild and was
[02:57:32.360 --> 02:57:41.240]  wild and was a tyrant it was abraham lincoln that arrested all of his opposition and let the army
[02:57:41.240 --> 02:57:48.680]  rob everything even in the north i mean they use it as a power grab oh man and again i'm not saying
[02:57:48.680 --> 02:57:53.320]  the south was good either it was all manipulated by british intelligence see it's not one side's
[02:57:53.320 --> 02:57:57.880]  good other sides bad usually usually it's more complex than that and lincoln actually thought
[02:57:57.880 --> 02:58:03.240]  he was doing good i've actually read his writings the guy owned nothing wanted to own nothing he was
[02:58:03.240 --> 02:58:08.360]  very very strange person his wife was into the occult i mean this guy's a weirdo man
[02:58:09.320 --> 02:58:11.880]  probably the weirdest president we've ever had i mean a real weirdo
[02:58:15.320 --> 02:58:20.440]  the point is go read oh it doesn't even matter people like what he ended slavery
[02:58:20.440 --> 02:58:25.880]  he said i don't want to end slavery he did that at the end it was not about slavery slavery was
[02:58:25.880 --> 02:58:30.680]  already being phased out because whites in the south figured out slaves were being used to
[02:58:30.680 --> 02:58:36.280]  leverage them and keep them as sharecroppers anyways oh my gosh i'm gonna go into overdrive

[03:00:52.760 --> 03:00:58.600]  a very uh well too liberal extremely liberal place to live but you know i truly believe
[03:00:58.600 --> 03:01:02.200]  that it has nothing to do with your political party it has really nothing to do with what
[03:01:02.200 --> 03:01:06.760]  your personal beliefs are it's about you know government control you know we have the the right
[03:01:06.760 --> 03:01:11.480]  to choose our own party and the right to do our own things play america's so great but we shouldn't
[03:01:12.120 --> 03:01:16.200]  you know we shouldn't um let the government control us the way they're slowly doing
[03:01:16.200 --> 03:01:21.160]  actually rapidly doing now like you say well i mean so-called liberals are at the tail end of
[03:01:21.160 --> 03:01:25.480]  the payoff the globalists are going to take everything they've got and it's important that
[03:01:25.480 --> 03:01:29.800]  they remember why they've been enslaved see that's why they got to have the physical clamp
[03:01:29.800 --> 03:01:34.920]  down because they know people aren't going to go along with this very soon right right totally and
[03:01:34.920 --> 03:01:39.720]  you know i'm a democrat um but i'm more of a libertarian than a democrat and all my friends
[03:01:39.720 --> 03:01:43.960]  are democrats and even they are starting to open up based on the information i share with them they
[03:01:43.960 --> 03:01:47.800]  learn from you and i learned my own research well they better just figure out both parties are

[03:02:02.600 --> 03:02:07.480]  um and you're right you know the it's beyond just the second amendment it's it's all the amendments
[03:02:07.480 --> 03:02:11.720]  that are in danger if they take away the you know the guns from the people the second amendment
[03:02:11.720 --> 03:02:15.080]  a lot of people here in la think the second amendment isn't that we don't kill each other
[03:02:15.080 --> 03:02:19.160]  they don't know that it's really about um oh yeah they've spun it and said the second
[03:02:19.160 --> 03:02:24.200]  amendment means you don't have guns god bless you good to hear from you look gun crime is

[03:07:04.360 --> 03:07:09.880]  I want you to know some very important information. In 1985, President Ronald Reagan
[03:07:09.880 --> 03:07:14.440]  requested that carnivora be sent directly to the White House at a time when only the President
[03:07:14.440 --> 03:07:20.040]  could obtain this world-class healer. Now, 27 years later, carnivore capsules are used around
[03:07:20.040 --> 03:07:25.080]  the world to keep people healthy. Now you can protect yourself and your loved ones in this age

[03:08:01.400 --> 03:08:07.080]  He's the T-Rex of political talk. Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:08:10.920 --> 03:08:17.480]  Okay, let's race through your phone calls on this live worldwide broadcast on the 28th this Monday,
[03:08:17.480 --> 03:08:22.520]  and I'm your host Alex Jones. Let's go to Braun in Alabama. You're on the air. Welcome.
[03:08:23.720 --> 03:08:25.000]  How you doing Alex? Good, sir.
[03:08:25.000 --> 03:08:32.920]  You know me, I run wtfroi.com. I was calling about the Katrina virus and to inquire if you
[03:08:32.920 --> 03:08:39.320]  guys had heard about it because it's supposedly posing a big risk with the new norovirus strain
[03:08:39.320 --> 03:08:48.360]  and the flu spreading to all 50 states. Now he's talking about the guy that I interviewed on my
[03:08:48.360 --> 03:08:55.720]  show, David Christiansen. He's a decorated Air Force officer and he's warning about the
[03:08:56.520 --> 03:09:03.000]  possibility of a pandemic basically. I'll say this, I mean there was no heavy
[03:09:03.000 --> 03:09:10.520]  flu season four years ago with that whole hype with the H1N1. But this year I've seen more people
[03:09:10.520 --> 03:09:16.840]  sick, heard about more people sick. Overall, I've been super healthy the last few years and had more
[03:09:16.840 --> 03:09:23.640]  energy since I got on vitamins and minerals. But despite that, I have been sick twice in the last
[03:09:23.640 --> 03:09:29.240]  12 months or so, which is unheard of other than having allergies to hay fever and stuff that I've
[03:09:29.240 --> 03:09:37.240]  pretty much had for about 15 years. And it has just been rough and we know that so many of the
[03:09:37.240 --> 03:09:43.000]  flu shots they give actually turn into flu. That's admitted, it's such an incredible hoax
[03:09:43.560 --> 03:09:51.400]  that people go out and take shots. But no, I actually just search engine Katrina like the
[03:09:51.400 --> 03:10:02.440]  hurricane. He turns it Katrina virus, he was actually black bag NDA style before the first NDA
[03:10:02.440 --> 03:10:09.480]  provision really came across. And he's documented all this in the federal court documents on his
[03:10:09.480 --> 03:10:16.520]  website. Very interesting, I mean look, we know the H1N1 itself was not even really a real virus.
[03:10:16.520 --> 03:10:23.000]  It was a stimulant virus released the year before by one of those major companies. I forget which
[03:10:23.000 --> 03:10:27.880]  ones we had scientists on at the time. Again, it's truly amazing, I'll have to look more into that.
[03:10:27.880 --> 03:10:31.560]  Thank you, Braun. James in Texas, you're on the air, thanks for holding.
[03:10:31.560 --> 03:10:47.880]  Hey Alex, how you doing? Fantastic job. Look here, I work on law enforcement. Some years ago I called
[03:10:47.880 --> 03:10:48.920]  you to the station and you were just getting started on this Chinese stuff. Like say, we was
[03:10:48.920 --> 03:10:52.280]  investigating a drug run and everything in Houston, right? So we stopped at 18 with a truck.
[03:10:52.280 --> 03:10:57.880]  And lo and behold, we checked it out, it was a false bottom. Would you not believe that there
[03:10:57.880 --> 03:11:03.240]  was a Chinese guy sitting up on a laptop inside of an 18 truck that was a false bottom. And this
[03:11:03.240 --> 03:11:07.160]  was at the Port of Houston. People better understand that these guys are working on
[03:11:07.160 --> 03:11:10.600]  the port and lots of stuff we can't get out there. But I'm telling you, your port and these
[03:11:10.600 --> 03:11:14.520]  containers and everything, the way they just typically want to bring the Chinese into your
[03:11:14.520 --> 03:11:19.400]  particular country would be the containers. Because used containers are basically to have
[03:11:19.400 --> 03:11:25.240]  bomb shelters and everything else and use it for apartments now. And also, Ted Gunnison before he
[03:11:25.240 --> 03:11:31.880]  passed away, poor souls, said to y'all, even Mr. Navy Seals, and I'm a military myself,
[03:11:31.880 --> 03:11:37.320]  that the military was going after Seals, Special Forces, because we knew how to fight.
[03:11:37.320 --> 03:11:42.040]  And then voices came on to explain the same thing too, what you got to say. All these people
[03:11:42.040 --> 03:11:46.200]  down in the world don't understand and listen to what these people are saying. Even the politicians,
[03:11:46.200 --> 03:11:50.520]  because if they come in here and take over Chinese, the politicians are going to understand
[03:11:50.520 --> 03:11:54.440]  that there's going to be head on the chopping block too and left alone with us too. Because
[03:11:54.440 --> 03:11:58.520]  like I say, once they take over, they're going to get them too. So they better wake up to the
[03:11:58.520 --> 03:12:04.760]  fact of what's going on. And they're talking about a gun-free zone. Just put a sign up in
[03:12:04.760 --> 03:12:10.680]  the United States, a gun-free zone, and any nation will take over us. But decide to come,
[03:12:10.680 --> 03:12:13.480]  and our government, and the ones that they'll need, that's going to be a consistent-
[03:12:13.480 --> 03:12:16.680]  Sure, sure, sir, let me stop because you're making a lot of really good points. And I can tell you
[03:12:16.680 --> 03:12:20.600]  on a cell phone, I'm getting about 90% of it. Can you talk right into the phone?
[03:12:21.640 --> 03:12:23.240]  Right, one second.
[03:12:23.240 --> 03:12:25.560]  No, no, that's a lot better. Where's the phone now?
[03:12:25.560 --> 03:12:26.600]  Okay, can you hear me now?
[03:12:26.600 --> 03:12:30.520]  A million times better, I can tell that was a hands-free or something. Okay, start over,
[03:12:30.520 --> 03:12:34.440]  because you brought up General Boykin, you brought up Ted Gunnerson. Yeah, I remember Ted
[03:12:34.440 --> 03:12:42.840]  Gunnerson, now that you mention it, on my show 15 years ago, it was like 1998, saying in the future,
[03:12:42.840 --> 03:12:46.840]  they're going to say veterans of the terrorists. And I remember going, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[03:12:46.840 --> 03:12:52.760]  But it turns out now, again, imagine how over the top this is.
[03:12:53.480 --> 03:12:57.000]  Now the Homeland Security manuals that they're giving police all over the country say
[03:12:57.000 --> 03:13:01.880]  veterans are the number one enemy, bad mouthing the founding fathers. How obvious does this have
[03:13:01.880 --> 03:13:07.400]  to get? A, B, you were talking about finding Chinese coming in in these containers.
[03:13:08.120 --> 03:13:12.760]  That's actually come out in the news, AK-47s, drugs, and usually get swept under the rug.
[03:13:12.760 --> 03:13:16.680]  Start over what you were saying. I want people to hear all this really clearly now.
[03:13:17.240 --> 03:13:21.560]  And then specifically down in Houston, I guess you're a police officer, it sounds like.
[03:13:21.560 --> 03:13:27.160]  Are people waking up now when they've got a bill saying the government can keep its
[03:13:27.160 --> 03:13:30.120]  guns but the citizens can't? I mean, how obvious is that?
[03:13:30.120 --> 03:13:37.320]  Yes, everybody's waking up now. As a matter of fact, if you go on any network to try to find
[03:13:37.320 --> 03:13:41.720]  ammo and try to find weapons and everything. We just had a gun show in Houston this past
[03:13:41.720 --> 03:13:47.080]  weekend at the George R. Brown. And you can't find semi-automatic weapons and everything.
[03:13:47.080 --> 03:13:52.200]  People are realizing that the government is basically leaving us out there to dry.
[03:13:52.200 --> 03:13:55.480]  And for anybody to come in, if people are saying right now, it's like, look here,
[03:13:56.040 --> 03:14:00.760]  just put a sign in the United States to say, here, gun-free zone, come and take over and just take
[03:14:00.760 --> 03:14:05.320]  over the whole thing. And like I say, the politicians better understand that we are the
[03:14:05.320 --> 03:14:09.720]  first offense to help them because when it comes down to a long time ago, you remember a long time
[03:14:09.720 --> 03:14:14.360]  ago when you had the sheriff's department round up a posse to say, we need the citizens to protect.
[03:14:14.360 --> 03:14:20.680]  The same thing as we had back in the 50s. We had civil defense where everybody had weapons,
[03:14:20.680 --> 03:14:25.800]  they had the civil defense training to actually go to help the country. Now it's been imported
[03:14:25.800 --> 03:14:29.720]  where they've basically talked to giving us away. And the politicians better understand that
[03:14:30.360 --> 03:14:35.640]  your people in America is the one that's going to be able to protect them if we get to the point of
[03:14:35.640 --> 03:14:40.600]  getting overthrown. Because when we go, they go the same time too, and there's nobody to protect
[03:14:40.600 --> 03:14:44.280]  them. They think they got redoubts, but like I said, again, they're letting them come in there
[03:14:44.280 --> 03:14:49.160]  through the port. Listen, I agree, this is what crazy elites have always done.
[03:14:49.160 --> 03:14:54.200]  They oppress their own people till the whole system collapses. That's why the third world
[03:14:54.200 --> 03:15:00.040]  is the way it is. And it's just insane. And again, I go back to crime statistics. I don't
[03:15:00.040 --> 03:15:05.000]  just believe every government statistic like unemployment or inflation. We know those are
[03:15:05.000 --> 03:15:11.000]  cooked, we've had experts on. Worldwide, the Bible of statistics is crime statistics
[03:15:11.640 --> 03:15:15.320]  set up by J. Edgar Hoover himself with the card index system.
[03:15:15.320 --> 03:15:18.920]  They get the local numbers, they put them in, they're not perfect, but there's some of the best
[03:15:18.920 --> 03:15:28.360]  numbers out there. 49% drop in violent crime since 1991. Now, everybody knows more guns means less
[03:15:28.360 --> 03:15:34.040]  crime. And so the fact that the police are hearing turn the guns in, they're not stupid.
[03:15:34.040 --> 03:15:37.880]  And so that's good news, though, because what you're saying is what I'm getting.
[03:15:37.880 --> 03:15:42.520]  Even police that thought patriots were loons are now going, wait, it's all happening.
[03:15:42.520 --> 03:15:44.920]  I really think the establishment is miscalculated.
[03:15:44.920 --> 03:15:51.560]  But the thing about it, Alex, they need to go back to the civil defense because
[03:15:51.560 --> 03:15:56.920]  we have given away our civil defense to, like I said, a long time ago. I'm 52 years old.
[03:15:56.920 --> 03:16:03.080]  And we had that where we would defend the country, not put our country in harm's way.
[03:16:03.080 --> 03:16:07.720]  So we need to turn the people around and say, look here, instead of us giving our guns away,
[03:16:07.720 --> 03:16:09.160]  we need to protect even-
[03:16:09.160 --> 03:16:10.280]  I mean, even-
[03:16:10.280 --> 03:16:15.560]  Absolutely, and if we have a collapse, the good people need to be armed. The good people turning
[03:16:15.560 --> 03:16:20.280]  their guns in during a collapse is the opposite of what you want. God bless you. Let me play this
[03:16:20.280 --> 03:16:27.560]  clip for you and get your take on it, James. He's a police officer from Houston. This is Sheriff
[03:16:27.560 --> 03:16:34.360]  David Clark of Milwaukee saying, hey, they're laying off sheriff's deputies. We're having cuts.
[03:16:35.000 --> 03:16:39.880]  And he responded down to the city council getting on to him for the city. He's outside the city.
[03:16:39.880 --> 03:16:44.760]  He's saying, look, you guys have got bodyguards. The general public doesn't. Here is that clip.
[03:16:45.640 --> 03:16:48.680]  I'm Sheriff David Clark and I want to talk to you about something personal,
[03:16:48.680 --> 03:16:53.560]  your safety. It's no longer a spectator sport. I need you in the game. But are you ready?
[03:16:53.560 --> 03:16:58.360]  With officers laid off and furloughed, simply calling 911 and waiting is no longer your best
[03:16:58.360 --> 03:17:02.840]  option. You can beg for mercy from a violent criminal, hide under the bed, or you can fight
[03:17:02.840 --> 03:17:07.560]  back. But are you prepared? Consider taking a certified safety course and handling a firearm
[03:17:07.560 --> 03:17:12.200]  so you can defend yourself until we get there. You have a duty to protect yourself and your family.
[03:17:12.200 --> 03:17:15.720]  We're partners now. Can I count on you? This safety message brought to you by the
[03:17:15.720 --> 03:17:18.040]  Milwaukee County Sheriff's Office. What do you think of that?
[03:17:18.040 --> 03:17:24.520]  Oh, that's fantastic. I saw that and I'm aware of him and it was good because think about it.
[03:17:24.520 --> 03:17:30.280]  The citizens is the United States bodyguard. Not only the bodyguard for the United States,
[03:17:30.280 --> 03:17:33.800]  but you and I, because you want somebody, basically when I get in trouble, I want a
[03:17:33.800 --> 03:17:39.240]  citizen to protect me. And also these guys are so-called corrupt. Even to protect their
[03:17:39.240 --> 03:17:43.960]  sorry behind because simple reason that they're sorry, but you have a duty to do so. But they
[03:17:43.960 --> 03:17:50.280]  don't understand that. If you disarm your people, they actually put themselves in harm's way too.
[03:17:51.000 --> 03:17:54.200]  You're absolutely right. God bless you. Great points. Have a safe week.
[03:17:54.920 --> 03:18:00.520]  Yeah, it's gonna backfire on them if we just hold the line and get back in their face.
[03:18:00.520 --> 03:18:05.560]  They tell us, it's discrediting to get in their face. Baloney, they wanna keep you in a coma,
[03:18:05.560 --> 03:18:10.920]  folks. You've gotta get angry and get moving. And stand up and others will stand up who've
[03:18:10.920 --> 03:18:17.000]  been waiting in the shadows. Let's go to Bertrand real fast in Canada. Go ahead, Bertrand.
[03:18:18.520 --> 03:18:25.720]  Hey, Alex. Thanks for taking my call. I gotta apologize to you. I confronted you quite a few
[03:18:25.720 --> 03:18:32.280]  years ago on your show and I doubted you and I thought you had a hidden agenda. But you know what?
[03:18:33.320 --> 03:18:40.200]  I gotta apologize. I became a Prison Planet TV member back in 2010, in 2011.
[03:18:40.200 --> 03:18:46.200]  I'm sorry I didn't renew in 2012. Credit cards maxed out, but I'm gonna hopefully
[03:18:46.920 --> 03:18:54.440]  renew again soon. And after you did that interview with the guys that made the movie
[03:18:54.440 --> 03:18:59.720]  Lamp in the Dark, and you sold that video? Yes. On your website? Yes.
[03:19:00.600 --> 03:19:08.200]  And I just wanna rant to those idiots out there that create this propaganda,
[03:19:08.200 --> 03:19:14.520]  that you're a Vatican agent? That's a load of crap. You guys are idiots.
[03:19:14.520 --> 03:19:19.000]  Well, listen, listen, listen. They do it to make money, but that's fine. It doesn't matter.
[03:19:19.880 --> 03:19:23.640]  They say on everything else too. Let's just, and God bless you, I gotta go to break here,
[03:19:23.640 --> 03:19:28.680]  but let me just say this. Let's just say I'm a bad guy. Okay, let's get that debate out of the way.
[03:19:28.680 --> 03:19:34.120]  They wanna make my supporters defend me so that they don't fight the New World Order and wake
[03:19:34.120 --> 03:19:40.280]  people up. Don't defend me, everybody. Okay, I mean, defend me if they ever falsely arrest me
[03:19:40.280 --> 03:19:45.160]  or something, but don't defend me from made up crud. That's designed, the White House leaks
[03:19:45.160 --> 03:19:49.640]  admit, with Cass Sunstein and others, to get us fighting with each other. Just ignore it.
[03:19:49.640 --> 03:19:54.600]  Go wake people up about the New World Order coming down on us. Don't defend Alex Jones.
[03:19:54.600 --> 03:20:04.600]  That's meant to divert you off. Let them have me, okay? Let them go after me.
