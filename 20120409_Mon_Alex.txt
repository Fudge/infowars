[00:00.000 --> 00:11.560]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well
[00:11.560 --> 00:19.080]  so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin
[00:19.080 --> 00:42.840]  Texas Alex Jones welcome my friends welcome and thank you so much for
[00:42.840 --> 00:51.800]  joining us today on this Monday the 9th day of April 2012 we're gonna be live
[00:51.800 --> 00:57.640]  here for the next three hours and we have cleared the decks of guests today
[00:57.640 --> 01:04.320]  because I've got a lot of news I want to cover and also your phone calls there
[01:04.320 --> 01:12.000]  is an article here in front of me out of the Smithsonian also a study conducted
[01:12.000 --> 01:17.040]  by the Club of Rome back in the 1970s basically called for them to engineer
[01:17.040 --> 01:22.020]  this and now they sell the idea of peak oil and that we're all gonna have
[01:22.020 --> 01:26.560]  austerity and be poor as they systematically try to set up a post
[01:26.560 --> 01:35.280]  industrial world and a system similar to the Hunger Games artificial poverty
[01:35.280 --> 01:40.640]  artificial feudalism peak civilization MIT research team predicts global
[01:40.640 --> 01:47.960]  economic collapse and population decline they plan to cut off the resources
[01:47.960 --> 01:53.600]  to the entire world except for elite armored reservations and compounds and
[01:53.600 --> 02:00.000]  rural areas and in compact super city centers and here it is Club of Rome
[02:00.000 --> 02:08.240]  Smithsonian magazine and limits to growth there there's a video of that put
[02:08.240 --> 02:13.280]  out by the globalist in the UN morey strong all of it this is an article up
[02:13.280 --> 02:28.520]  at info wars.com that was put together by Mac Slavo at the shtfplan.com can't
[02:28.520 --> 02:34.600]  really say the name of it here on air but but this is the type of post
[02:34.600 --> 02:38.560]  industrial information that we've been putting out and now the globalists are
[02:38.560 --> 02:42.600]  just being quite honest about it homeland security is not meant to keep
[02:42.600 --> 02:49.280]  the prosperity of the country going it's meant to be a straightjacket in the
[02:49.280 --> 02:54.200]  orderly collapse of society and it's going to go into a predatory society
[02:54.200 --> 02:58.720]  where you kill grandma to quote hire 10 new teachers as Bill Gates that's a
[02:58.720 --> 03:02.000]  quote by the way so don't give her treatment let her die hire 10 teachers
[03:02.000 --> 03:07.000]  the teachers clap the idea is you kill somebody or you steal from somebody or
[03:07.000 --> 03:13.480]  you shut somebody down you get goodies and so that's a cannibalistic lose lose
[03:13.480 --> 03:19.760]  implosion post industrial system and again if you scroll down in the article
[03:19.760 --> 03:26.280]  that's at info wars.com you can see the graphs of what the globalist had planned
[03:26.280 --> 03:29.440]  those of you that keep saying where's the population reduction well they've
[03:29.440 --> 03:33.160]  slowed the growth it'd be about 10 billion right now instead of a seven and a
[03:33.160 --> 03:41.720]  half and by as you can see there by 2020 or so on their graph they plan to
[03:41.720 --> 03:48.200]  kill well you can see the graph right there what that's about 90% officially
[03:48.200 --> 03:53.600]  from MIT oh Alex where's the plan to get us oh where's the plan to kill us where
[03:53.600 --> 03:57.320]  where is it oh it's just in all these Rockefeller UN biological diversity
[03:57.320 --> 04:03.160]  assessments thousands of them here's another one MIT but they're all running
[04:03.160 --> 04:07.400]  around acting like all this is just going to happen on accident let me
[04:07.400 --> 04:10.360]  explain something the globalist already have super technologies life
[04:10.360 --> 04:14.840]  extension for 20 years they've been able to make rats not age now they're
[04:14.840 --> 04:22.760]  reversing aging we're not supposed to get access to that and that's why I went
[04:22.760 --> 04:29.880]  to church this weekend at a little church and saw two disabled children out of
[04:29.880 --> 04:37.680]  maybe 15 that were in the whole church and then I even had never been to this
[04:37.680 --> 04:41.560]  church before I had the father come over and say was a listener and say that
[04:41.560 --> 04:47.800]  research shows that he got the mutation when he was in his mother from her
[04:47.800 --> 04:53.480]  taking a vaccine I mean I'm just watching him do this to us give us in a
[04:53.480 --> 04:58.840]  wheelchair and a listener I mean this this is this is what they've done to us
[04:58.840 --> 05:05.160]  hi folks this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the silver lungs

[05:09.920 --> 05:13.840]  solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the
[05:13.840 --> 05:17.720]  lungs the respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne
[05:17.720 --> 05:22.680]  pathogens and viruses the silver lungs generator infuses the respiratory system
[05:22.680 --> 05:27.960]  with your self-produced nano silver solutions and also delivers the silver
[05:27.960 --> 05:32.560]  nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream with continued legislation
[05:32.560 --> 05:36.800]  threatening the sale of nano silver products you can now produce pure and
[05:36.800 --> 05:41.680]  endless colloidal silver with the silver lungs generator very easy to follow
[05:41.680 --> 05:46.400]  step-by-step instructions are provided making production fast and simple go to

[06:04.240 --> 06:08.360]  lifting weights and jogging but nothing was working my body was literally
[06:08.360 --> 06:12.800]  starving for minerals and trace elements as well as key vitamins and as soon as I
[06:12.800 --> 06:17.720]  had that I immediately could eat half of what I was eating previously and be
[06:17.720 --> 06:22.120]  satisfied now there are hundreds of great products at infowars team.com but

[07:06.720 --> 07:10.200]  did you know that in a real meltdown non-hybrid seeds could become more
[07:10.200 --> 07:13.840]  valuable than silver or gold it's true seeds have all performed even gold and
[07:13.840 --> 07:17.680]  silver before in this country and it's possible that could even happen again so
[07:17.680 --> 07:21.240]  our friends at solutions from science have put together the perfect mix of
[07:21.240 --> 07:26.720]  non-hybrid seeds they call it a survival seed bank and it can produce an endless

[08:01.040 --> 08:06.880]  from his central Texas command center deep behind enemy lines the information
[08:06.880 --> 08:13.480]  war continues it's Alex Jones and the GCN radio network
[08:13.480 --> 08:33.280]  every time I see an IMF World Bank UN Club of Rome Rockefeller Foundation
[08:33.280 --> 08:38.320]  Carnegie Foundation Ford Foundation document where the globalists are
[08:38.320 --> 08:43.200]  adding cancer viruses to our vaccines mutagens to the vaccines so that when
[08:43.200 --> 08:48.320]  pregnant women take shots as they're now advised to do but they've always known
[08:48.320 --> 08:54.600]  don't do they can give their children life crippling devastating disorders and
[08:54.600 --> 08:59.840]  diseases gifts from the eugenicist mass murderers their sacrament hurting the
[08:59.840 --> 09:04.760]  children as every ancient psycho culture did they just do it through covert
[09:04.760 --> 09:13.840]  means every time I see piles of new ones it makes my head spin and I got in this
[09:13.840 --> 09:19.400]  morning and they said RT international television once you on today about this
[09:19.400 --> 09:31.400]  article and I had separately seen all of the articles and reports in this by
[09:31.400 --> 09:39.400]  Mack Slavo at when you know what hits the fanplan.com it's also up at info
[09:39.400 --> 09:46.400]  wars.com you have it mirrored there but it still it was like being punched in
[09:46.400 --> 09:52.480]  the stomach that's how I describe it and so before I get into the mass murder the
[09:52.480 --> 09:58.640]  mayhem the shootings taking place all over the United States that are only
[09:58.640 --> 10:04.920]  gonna get worse and the racial attacks on both sides descending into Bedlam and
[10:04.920 --> 10:11.720]  police being killed and all of this I want to just briefly tell a story I'm
[10:11.720 --> 10:13.720]  gonna get to this now that we're gonna have wide open phones throughout the
[10:13.720 --> 10:21.080]  broadcast today we are live it is the ninth day of April 2012 I wasn't even
[10:21.080 --> 10:25.760]  gonna talk about this because he's you know just here in town visiting and but
[10:25.760 --> 10:31.240]  because he's part of the story I have to tell it Dave must stay in his wife and
[10:31.240 --> 10:36.640]  daughter here in town staying with me visiting turned out we're we've turned
[10:36.640 --> 10:39.280]  into really good friends of money for years but we've turned into really good
[10:39.280 --> 10:46.080]  friends and we wanted to go to church somewhere and Dave I live out in the
[10:46.080 --> 10:48.720]  country he said that looks like an interesting little place that little
[10:48.720 --> 10:54.720]  Baptist Church let's let's go there I've never been to a Baptist Church so we go
[10:54.720 --> 11:03.960]  to the services at 11 a.m. and there's probably this little buddy church that's
[11:03.960 --> 11:09.800]  you know more full on a Easter Sunday the most popular day of the year to go
[11:09.800 --> 11:18.480]  church I guess after Christmas and we're there and we come in right at 11
[11:18.480 --> 11:24.640]  like seconds before they start singing the first hams and so nobody sees me
[11:24.640 --> 11:30.240]  come in nobody sees Dave mustain come in except for the usher he's oh Alex Jones
[11:30.240 --> 11:34.760]  oh then they were looking at Dave and his wife and I my wife my children were
[11:34.760 --> 11:38.320]  with my parents at their church in downtown Austin so they weren't there
[11:38.320 --> 11:45.240]  so we get in the back row and the and sometimes you go to church and you don't
[11:45.240 --> 11:49.520]  really feel you know powerful spiritual presence in the building but these
[11:49.520 --> 11:54.840]  people were all really praying really love God and it was just an old-fashioned
[11:54.840 --> 11:59.160]  Baptist you know church service wasn't really one of their fire and damnation
[11:59.160 --> 12:03.640]  ones but it was just a nice you know Easter service about the four different
[12:03.640 --> 12:10.880]  types of soil and you know you throw the seeds onto the hard soil and then
[12:10.880 --> 12:14.440]  there's the rocky soil and there's the soil it's got too much stuff already
[12:14.440 --> 12:19.600]  growing on it and there's the soil that's that's just right and the whole time I'm
[12:19.600 --> 12:27.880]  in there I'm looking at this father and his four children three sweet cute
[12:27.880 --> 12:34.720]  beautiful little girls and his son who's over on the side of the pew in a
[12:34.720 --> 12:40.920]  wheelchair and you know obviously has some medical issues I'm just gonna leave
[12:40.920 --> 12:45.040]  it at that and I'm watching the father holding his hand they're about five rows
[12:45.040 --> 12:50.880]  up they don't see me there and I see some other child that's obviously disabled
[12:50.880 --> 12:55.760]  in there and I'm just thinking and I'm looking I got notice it's boys it's the
[12:55.760 --> 13:00.440]  boys that are all because the the pesticides the heavy metals the fluoride
[13:00.440 --> 13:06.440]  the vaccines boys don't have the blood-brain barrier the organ barriers
[13:06.440 --> 13:10.040]  aren't as strong girls any doctor will tell you this for thousands of years but
[13:10.040 --> 13:15.760]  it's been medically proven girls can take more poison they can environmentally
[13:15.760 --> 13:21.440]  survive more things gunshot wounds girls are much tougher than men not not
[13:21.440 --> 13:27.800]  physically women live longer because women have got to carry children women
[13:27.800 --> 13:32.720]  are tough and so now the autism spiking in girls and other disorders and things
[13:32.720 --> 13:38.360]  but it's the boys it's hitting and I'm sitting there the whole time and you can
[13:38.360 --> 13:40.800]  call me psychic whatever this kind of stuff happens all the time but really
[13:40.800 --> 13:46.640]  it's spiritual I realized I said those people are going to be listeners that
[13:46.640 --> 13:57.840]  child is vaccine damaged and I kept wanting to get up and go around and go
[13:57.840 --> 14:02.000]  over there and just hug the young boy like he was about 10 11 years old and I
[14:02.000 --> 14:06.560]  said you know what I'm just gonna get up here and walk out of here you know at
[14:06.560 --> 14:11.360]  the end but I said I and then in my mind you see God said no you're gonna end up
[14:11.360 --> 14:14.960]  meeting that child and those people are listeners and they're gonna come to you
[14:14.960 --> 14:21.160]  so the church thing ends we get up Dave his wife everybody's hurt leaving first
[14:21.160 --> 14:28.760]  I'm leaving the dad had somehow later seen me runs over and then his son comes
[14:28.760 --> 14:33.200]  up in the wheelchair and they say I listen to your show and I'm gonna get
[14:33.200 --> 14:36.680]  into their personal things they told me they don't know their names but people
[14:36.680 --> 14:42.120]  in the church may be listening so I'm not gonna say but he said yeah we've
[14:42.120 --> 14:45.680]  talked to doctors and they agree the vaccines did this even the doctors you
[14:45.680 --> 14:55.280]  know basically and it was just such an intense thing to be sitting there in a
[14:55.280 --> 14:59.760]  church of probably 95 100 people I guess we count the choir and the preacher it
[14:59.760 --> 15:03.400]  was over a hundred probably there's probably 20 people up on the little stage
[15:03.400 --> 15:12.240]  but I mean I knew I was gonna have an experience with that child in the
[15:12.240 --> 15:16.800]  wheelchair I knew it I saw the whole thing before it even happened that's
[15:16.800 --> 15:21.400]  God that's the spiritual people people who've never experienced this like I do
[15:21.400 --> 15:29.440]  on a daily basis don't know what it is don't understand it don't know it but I
[15:29.440 --> 15:34.720]  you know I think and then what was incredible is Dave had said that morning
[15:34.720 --> 15:40.160]  he said I I think it's good we go there and he'd already told his wife he said I
[15:40.160 --> 15:44.680]  think Alex is gonna have an experience at that church that's gonna reaffirm to
[15:44.680 --> 15:48.000]  him that he needs to be in church to strengthen others that are in the church
[15:48.000 --> 15:52.560]  he may not think he needs church but he needs to find a good church and I think
[15:52.560 --> 15:55.720]  something's gonna happen today and of course you know I'm gonna go to Dave's
[15:55.720 --> 15:59.280]  private things but you know Dave's had some real experiences with God and that's
[15:59.280 --> 16:02.920]  why he's no longer into the occult he's a Christian been a Christian now for many
[16:02.920 --> 16:07.560]  years and as he said the road just got smoothed once he became a Christian hope
[16:07.560 --> 16:14.960]  he doesn't ever get tested like Job but it was such a an amazing empowering but
[16:14.960 --> 16:21.120]  also exhausting experience because it's things like that happening
[16:21.120 --> 16:31.920]  that are and of course an atheist will say well that's just a coincidence really
[16:31.920 --> 16:34.680]  I won't tell you the other stuff because people wouldn't believe it that's
[16:34.680 --> 16:47.680]  nothing compared to hundreds of experiences I've had hundreds where
[16:47.680 --> 16:53.640]  it's just like it's almost like this is too real life is too intense reality is
[16:53.640 --> 16:59.920]  so powerful I know a people retreat into sports and television and sitcoms and
[16:59.920 --> 17:04.320]  alcohol and drugs and mindlessness because that's what the world has to
[17:04.320 --> 17:15.200]  offer and it's shallow it's poisonous and unfulfilling but being fulfilled is so
[17:15.200 --> 17:25.760]  much more intense it's like a acid trip that never ends that you can't get off
[17:25.760 --> 17:30.720]  of not that I've ever done hallucinators but I've read about it heard people say
[17:30.720 --> 17:34.280]  it's like I don't mean literal like hallucination I'm saying reality is so
[17:34.280 --> 17:42.080]  intense the colors of the light hitting leaves in an oak tree or or or flowers in
[17:42.080 --> 17:46.640]  a field or the ocean or a sunset or innocent children and and beauty and
[17:46.640 --> 17:52.520]  just the beauty of women I mean I see beautiful women now and I don't even
[17:52.520 --> 17:58.080]  think about sex with them I just like just it all at the life force and the
[17:58.080 --> 18:14.520]  beauty just crackling I see life I see the universe and you've got to open
[18:14.520 --> 18:17.560]  yourself up to it to really realize people like they would say I want to go
[18:17.560 --> 18:22.240]  to space I want to I want to go to space you're in space I want to go to Mars I
[18:22.240 --> 18:26.280]  want to go to Venus I want to go to Neptune I want to see these things you
[18:26.280 --> 18:32.680]  do you're on a planet you're on an incredibly rare planet with with with
[18:32.680 --> 18:38.220]  giant oceans and incredible life forms and beauty you're in the universe you
[18:38.220 --> 18:43.920]  walk outside and you're so close to a Sun it burns your skin we're bathed in a
[18:43.920 --> 18:53.040]  wide spectrum of different particles it we but but but we recognize beauty the
[18:53.040 --> 19:00.400]  firmament is the evidence of God the architect people say oh the Luciferians
[19:00.400 --> 19:04.680]  call there says they're God the architect that counterfeit of the real
[19:04.680 --> 19:10.440]  architect the real great architect you look what the New World Order builds it

[25:04.480 --> 25:08.720]  coming up and I must cover all of this today in this little short segment let
[25:08.720 --> 25:13.400]  me just give you a preview but I want to just briefly go back to the issue of
[25:13.400 --> 25:18.400]  pediatric cancers depending on which statistical grouping you look at on
[25:18.400 --> 25:27.480]  average you're up about 10,000% since the 1950s you heard me 10,000% what's the
[25:27.480 --> 25:37.320]  percentage increase if we were one in 25,300 and change neurological disorder
[25:37.320 --> 25:43.360]  classed as autism and now it's one in 60 or one in 50 something it it varies
[25:43.360 --> 25:50.520]  that's that's multi-thousand increase as well diabetes depending on the type but
[25:50.520 --> 25:54.040]  the most common types of 3,000% increase on it in the general public
[25:54.040 --> 25:59.400]  Hispanics it's even higher I mean I go to public places and see 30 year old
[25:59.400 --> 26:03.400]  Hispanics with their arms and legs shot off and I don't need to ask them but I
[26:03.400 --> 26:06.160]  have I'm like oh how are you doing all they're sitting there waiting for a
[26:06.160 --> 26:10.080]  prescription you got diabetes yeah they may have to chop mother leg off oh
[26:10.080 --> 26:15.800]  really they tell you not to drink that big fat diet coke you're drinking doctor
[26:15.800 --> 26:21.040]  tell you not to do that no they told me to drink this yeah you might actually
[26:21.040 --> 26:24.960]  find out that's worse than sugar for a diabetic but you know what I'm not gonna
[26:24.960 --> 26:29.680]  give you medical advice I actually do that and it's not because you know I see
[26:29.680 --> 26:34.400]  somebody with their legs sawed off just all over the place Hispanics everywhere
[26:34.400 --> 26:39.160]  legs arms sawed off just drive down the town that the drop by bus stops instead
[26:39.160 --> 26:42.680]  of just thinking about yourself start looking at the bus stops and you'll
[26:42.680 --> 26:47.560]  probably pass 10 bus stops for you run into a Hispanic person with their legs
[26:47.560 --> 26:54.040]  or arms cut off from diabetes I just happen to notice things you know I go
[26:54.040 --> 26:57.720]  to a church I just happen to notice let me see how many kids are there they're
[26:57.720 --> 27:01.880]  soft killing in here oh there's one right there
[27:04.000 --> 27:08.400]  okay they're not killing us then where is it coming from oh I just happen to have
[27:08.400 --> 27:11.520]  all these documents where they admit they're doing and that's coming up later
[27:11.520 --> 27:16.440]  it's an article at info wars calm peak civilization MIT research team predicts
[27:16.440 --> 27:26.080]  global economic collapse in population decline and they've got a you know I'm
[27:26.080 --> 27:34.720]  sorry they have a 90 plus percent scroll down to MIT's graph this from MIT
[27:34.720 --> 27:41.440]  that's a 90 plus percent decline in the population how's that sound for you
[27:41.440 --> 27:47.360]  there on some of those graphs they've got different predictions services per
[27:47.360 --> 27:51.720]  capita population global population no global population is the blue one yeah
[27:51.720 --> 27:57.280]  that's over 90% you like that you like that that's why they're teaching your
[27:57.280 --> 28:01.760]  kids there's no no no oil left or no coal left that's why they're teaching you
[28:01.760 --> 28:04.880]  that living is bad having kids are bad because they're getting everybody ready
[28:04.880 --> 28:09.160]  with the racial psychological idea and memory and they got shows on history
[28:09.160 --> 28:14.840]  discover history science PBS all the major textbooks college high school are
[28:14.840 --> 28:20.080]  getting everybody ready to die so when they release the bio weapons and the
[28:20.080 --> 28:24.120]  rest of it and cut off the third world supplies and huge wars break out in
[28:24.120 --> 28:28.520]  bedlam it won't matter in the West because we'll be so mesmerized by TV and
[28:28.520 --> 28:35.520]  drugs legal and illegal now again it's a total diabolical plan it's totally
[28:35.520 --> 28:43.040]  documented in such a voluminous piles and and and I need to calmly present this
[28:43.040 --> 28:46.160]  but but sometimes I think well no you shouldn't be calm about this you've
[28:46.160 --> 28:49.280]  been successful because you are being real and freaking out because see I'm
[28:49.280 --> 28:54.480]  freaking out I can't go to a church with a hundred people in it without seeing
[28:54.480 --> 28:59.760]  kids who you can tell they're struggling for their lives I'll just leave it at
[28:59.760 --> 29:06.000]  that because of these new world order people and I don't feel too friendly
[29:06.000 --> 29:10.560]  towards the new world order but my hatred and my disgust is nothing compared
[29:10.560 --> 29:15.400]  to my love and it's not because I'm a good person I don't people hold up he
[29:15.400 --> 29:19.400]  cares about who doesn't think if I don't care about that kid I don't care
[29:19.400 --> 29:22.440]  about mine yeah and it's not some conscious thing but that's why I'm
[29:22.440 --> 29:30.600]  designed that way you know when you got ten thousand plus percentage point
[29:30.600 --> 29:34.440]  increases in pediatric cancers I think every day how I don't do enough to keep

[32:10.640 --> 32:13.960]  the soils that we grow our crops on here in the United States and across the
[32:13.960 --> 32:18.280]  industrialized world are almost completely depleted of almost all of the

[33:09.600 --> 33:16.400]  assault on the lies of the new world order it's Alex Jones on the GCN radio
[33:16.400 --> 33:30.520]  network
[33:30.520 --> 33:38.600]  okay so my final little message to the new world order people is this you are
[33:38.600 --> 33:46.360]  not going to get away with what you're doing God the universe justice is going
[33:46.360 --> 33:50.640]  to have victory over you you're not going to disease the genetic genome of
[33:50.640 --> 33:55.080]  humanity and the planet while playing God and posing as the saviors of the
[33:55.080 --> 33:59.880]  earth while you run around and engage in your psychopathic activities and get
[33:59.880 --> 34:05.480]  away with it you are not going to release your future bio weapons and get
[34:05.480 --> 34:10.960]  away with it unscathed you're not going to reduce our population by over 90%
[34:10.960 --> 34:15.840]  and end up getting away with it because we're aware of you we're exposing you
[34:15.840 --> 34:20.520]  and the full horror of what you're doing is so huge I understand that most
[34:20.520 --> 34:24.520]  people can't come to grips with it but it's never a majority that prevails over
[34:24.520 --> 34:30.240]  evil and we are getting the message out we are reaching out to our fellow
[34:30.240 --> 34:35.840]  humans and the organizations are being formed the ideas are being developed the
[34:35.840 --> 34:40.680]  information and the countermeasures are being deployed and we have only begun to
[34:40.680 --> 34:46.960]  fight in fact our new motto is going to be taken from John Paul Jones father of
[34:46.960 --> 34:52.560]  the US Navy he says I have just begun to fight or I I have only just begun to
[34:52.560 --> 35:00.040]  fight to we have just begun to fight in fact when you guys pull up the John Paul
[35:00.040 --> 35:03.920]  Jones famous quote for me I want to make sure I'm getting it word for word
[35:03.920 --> 35:15.080]  exactly right and another saying that he had was win or die you know victory or
[35:15.080 --> 35:21.040]  death from Colonel Travis at the Alamo but it is death if we don't have victory
[35:21.040 --> 35:26.160]  over these people it is enslavement it is bondage it's dying those thousands of
[35:26.160 --> 35:31.520]  little cowardly deaths every day and I think about how much the globalist
[35:31.520 --> 35:37.040]  enjoy people having to form children how much they enjoy children dying
[35:37.040 --> 35:42.920]  excruciating deaths how much they enjoy the troops breathing to you and then
[35:42.920 --> 35:49.240]  coming home and having children with incredibly painful malformations and
[35:49.240 --> 35:54.640]  disorders and diseases and how much they just enjoy going to work every day
[35:54.640 --> 35:58.160]  the globalists talk about their eugenics and how much they enjoy it they
[35:58.160 --> 36:06.080]  really enjoy killing people in horrible painful soul-sucking life-destroying
[36:06.080 --> 36:11.480]  illnesses of course many times these painful experiences actually only make
[36:11.480 --> 36:16.120]  people grow more spiritually so God turns that to good but it is just
[36:16.120 --> 36:20.200]  unspeakable what the New World Order does and I want them to know I see what
[36:20.200 --> 36:26.360]  you do I see you playing in the guts of our children I see you running around
[36:26.360 --> 36:33.240]  with wanton repine with bloodthirst hurting the innocence as all of your
[36:33.240 --> 36:36.840]  ilk have done throughout history and I am fully aware of what you're doing and
[36:36.840 --> 36:48.160]  you will be brought very very low I have not yet begun to fight was uttered and
[36:48.160 --> 36:53.680]  replied to a cheerful British taunt you know that was when both ships were on
[36:53.680 --> 36:57.960]  fire but the bigger British ship was a sinking his and they still didn't give
[36:57.960 --> 37:04.520]  up and ended up their powder room blew up and then he got the big victory that
[37:04.520 --> 37:08.920]  happened over and over again with John Paul Jones amazing amazing all those
[37:08.920 --> 37:14.240]  real stories from the Revolutionary War there were cases where he'd like me he'd
[37:14.240 --> 37:19.040]  fight five ships and all five other ships will be bigger than has and when
[37:19.040 --> 37:27.400]  because you've got to go straight Adam you've got to come straight on and that's
[37:27.400 --> 37:33.240]  the real power lies in being outnumbered the real power lies from
[37:33.240 --> 37:40.320]  having nothing left to lose that's where it is and saying I am committed you're
[37:40.320 --> 37:50.600]  on fire you're sinking strike your colors I have not yet begun to fight and
[37:50.600 --> 37:53.880]  then members of the crew wanted to give up and he turned around pulled his sword
[37:53.880 --> 38:00.560]  out and said I'm gonna start chopping you up if you give up
[38:00.560 --> 38:13.520]  and that was just fighting because they were tired of the oppressive British
[38:13.520 --> 38:17.680]  rule basically having double the taxes on people on the colonies than they had
[38:17.680 --> 38:22.040]  back in England they were just tired of the corruption and the swaggering
[38:22.040 --> 38:27.400]  government bureaucrats and the swaggering police that was just because they
[38:27.400 --> 38:31.360]  didn't like being bullied imagine if the founders would have known that they were
[38:31.360 --> 38:36.880]  being injected with cancer viruses or or their children being deformed I mean
[38:36.880 --> 38:43.400]  that's how sick these globalist hate America and the West so much that the
[38:43.400 --> 38:47.000]  Romans would come into an area that resisted them and kill everyone and tear
[38:47.000 --> 38:52.760]  down the emplacements and throw expensive salt into the earth so they
[38:52.760 --> 38:58.680]  couldn't grow crops inside the walled cities so that they couldn't down the
[38:58.680 --> 39:02.440]  road have a another siege you know in case they didn't catch everybody and
[39:02.440 --> 39:06.160]  people ran to the hills and later went back to the fort when they came back the
[39:06.160 --> 39:10.600]  well was poisoned the areas inside the fort where you could grow some crops
[39:10.600 --> 39:18.440]  the earth was salted well the globalists are salting our loins sperm
[39:18.440 --> 39:23.960]  counts down by almost 90% it's like 87% last number I saw a few years ago from
[39:23.960 --> 39:27.760]  the sinners for disease control you're like gee we don't know why it's
[39:27.760 --> 39:35.440]  happening same numbers similar numbers in Europe women's eggs and ovaries are
[39:35.440 --> 39:38.760]  just fried on average you're gonna have children you better get started early
[39:38.760 --> 39:43.880]  because that stuff really kicks in later your body's resilient but not that
[39:43.880 --> 39:51.360]  resilient the IQs are dropping the life expectancies are dropping every disease
[39:51.360 --> 39:55.440]  and neurological disorder is just turbocharged right now and it's gonna
[39:55.440 --> 39:59.760]  get crazier and crazier that you know the media is like okay well it's not the
[39:59.760 --> 40:04.880]  vaccines because Bill and Melinda Gates say so but gee the reporters are like
[40:04.880 --> 40:08.840]  my kid got the shot and can't walk or talk now he was 18 months old and
[40:08.840 --> 40:12.200]  healthy and happy but they say it in the shot but he had a convulsion on the way
[40:12.200 --> 40:18.160]  home and Bobby doesn't talk anymore and my neighbor's kid same thing you really
[40:18.160 --> 40:24.080]  government you know it's 150 something now it was one in 25,000 what's going on
[40:24.080 --> 40:28.480]  the government's like we'll have a local jog a race and you'll raise some money
[40:28.480 --> 40:31.520]  and give it to an organization we control and then we'll make sure you never
[40:31.520 --> 40:35.680]  get the answer they're like oh you're gonna you're gonna continue to take our
[40:35.680 --> 40:44.760]  sons from us thank you it's like maybe if we're really lucky we can lower little
[40:44.760 --> 40:48.280]  coffins into the ground that's what and then you have to there'll be a local
[40:48.280 --> 40:52.480]  race for us or something yeah and then you can go join a big group under the
[40:52.480 --> 40:56.880]  American Medical Association it's helping cover all this up and you'll
[40:56.880 --> 41:02.320]  give them money to you know to always talk about treating autism not finding
[41:02.320 --> 41:06.440]  out why it's exploding oh let's have another race you know I walk up the
[41:06.440 --> 41:11.400]  counter at restaurants stores about a pair of shoes they go would you like
[41:11.400 --> 41:15.800]  to give $10 for breast cancer research and awareness and I was look at the
[41:15.800 --> 41:21.160]  person and I say I always give them a chance I say no they say really and I
[41:21.160 --> 41:25.480]  went number one I'd imagine in most cases these charities I bet this company's
[41:25.480 --> 41:29.160]  keeping part of it can I see the fine print they're like oh let me get it from
[41:29.160 --> 41:33.080]  the counter I hadn't read this oh hold on there's a line here but you wanted to
[41:33.080 --> 41:37.320]  you wanted to make me feel bad like I done something wrong oh look right here
[41:37.320 --> 41:42.600]  it says 30% going to this the rest is to the awareness program that's how this
[41:42.600 --> 41:46.080]  shoe store you know is trying to give people breast cancer awareness it's
[41:46.080 --> 41:49.920]  basically advertisement for you let me explain something if you don't want your
[41:49.920 --> 41:53.840]  wife or mother's breast to rot off that's the type of thing I say in public
[41:53.840 --> 41:58.000]  people start getting mad I don't care hey what's your problem buddy you like the
[41:58.000 --> 42:03.400]  fact breast cancers off the charts right now why is it always we want to find a
[42:03.400 --> 42:07.720]  treatment for it or a cure why don't we try to find out why everybody's getting
[42:07.720 --> 42:09.840]  it
[42:12.400 --> 42:18.480]  and a few times I have the people say shut up pal happened at the airport once
[42:18.480 --> 42:24.360]  with Rob do this guy came over because I was talking to some people and and
[42:24.360 --> 42:28.240]  started a fight with me the police were putting him in handcuffs a lot of decline
[42:28.240 --> 42:34.040]  depressed charges and assaulted me we even have the end of the exchange on
[42:34.040 --> 42:36.400]  video
[42:39.200 --> 42:42.840]  just like when I was at the Grand Canyon that's on video and the UN signs out
[42:42.840 --> 42:46.560]  there saying it's all in her UN control and the surrounding area and there's no
[42:46.560 --> 42:50.440]  one out there by the side of this ranger station I'm on the back side and a guy
[42:50.440 --> 42:54.320]  hears me so I was shooting video and hurting talking to his wife and look
[42:54.320 --> 42:58.920]  back he walks like 30 feet out of the way to talk trash about me and imply I
[42:58.920 --> 43:02.640]  need to get out of the way well I all come in honey as soon as I got a chance
[43:02.640 --> 43:06.700]  to read this plaque that this guy's standing in front of talking because an
[43:06.700 --> 43:12.620]  American was dare talking around the side of some wind swept they get the
[43:12.620 --> 43:19.120]  Grand Canyon at the at the main park ranger center that literally almost no
[43:19.120 --> 43:23.680]  one was in big giant sprawling facility I'm around the side showing a UN sign
[43:23.680 --> 43:28.160]  just shooting a video and the guy coming over is on video talking trash
[43:28.160 --> 43:31.600]  getting in my space right behind me he was he had like American flags on his
[43:31.600 --> 43:35.040]  hat and all this veteran stuff and he was kind of bowing up like he was a
[43:35.040 --> 43:38.260]  tough guy back in the Navy 40 years ago beating people up like he was
[43:38.260 --> 43:41.720]  intimidating me and as soon as I turned around and got his face he ran off
[43:41.720 --> 43:47.400]  listen you unamerican punk piece of filth I will go shoot video of the UN
[43:47.400 --> 43:51.480]  takeover you trash you coward let me tell you it's you people that are gonna
[43:51.480 --> 43:56.240]  destroy this country the student with your American flags everywhere you people
[43:56.240 --> 43:59.600]  who think you've got all this strength and you think I'm putting America down
[43:59.600 --> 44:03.480]  by showing how America is being taken over it's you people that have allowed
[44:03.480 --> 44:07.080]  this to happen because you'll do whatever the government says if the US
[44:07.080 --> 44:11.040]  government sticks a UN sign out there pointing out under US code that it's
[44:11.040 --> 44:15.520]  owned and controlled by the UN then it must be good and I'm the trader for not
[44:15.520 --> 44:21.480]  liking it you'd come out of your way to henpeck another citizen to shut me up
[44:21.480 --> 44:26.080]  like you were a sergeant keeping the troops mouths quiet if they grumbled on
[44:26.080 --> 44:30.680]  base see Sarge I don't think we should be handling this chemical weapon with our
[44:30.680 --> 44:35.080]  hands and taken to the incinerators shut up I've heard the stories person five
[44:35.080 --> 44:38.600]  years later is getting lowered into the ground from the from the from the
[44:38.600 --> 44:43.480]  chemicals this is it's this culture of denial listen I can handle people being
[44:43.480 --> 44:48.200]  jellyfish and rolling over in a ditch and begging for destruction but don't
[44:48.200 --> 44:51.760]  try to get in my way when I'm trying to warn people that want to hear the
[44:51.760 --> 44:57.240]  warning okay get out of my way get out of my way don't you dare lecture me to
[44:57.240 --> 45:01.640]  give money to breast cancer research okay I've done the breast cancer research
[45:01.640 --> 45:05.800]  I've had the top scientist on they know good and well by the way Bayer is back
[45:05.800 --> 45:10.800]  in the news it turns out the Environmental Protection Agency has
[45:10.800 --> 45:15.400]  internal reports and it's known for many years what we already knew one
[45:15.400 --> 45:21.360]  particular type of pesticide put out by Bayer and their pesticide division is
[45:21.360 --> 45:28.200]  the main cause of a cocktail of reasons killing the honeybees what do you think
[45:28.200 --> 45:33.000]  it's doing to you Bayer are the people who knowingly for over a decade shipped
[45:33.000 --> 45:38.240]  out factor 8 blood supply to hemophiliacs knowing every injection was
[45:38.240 --> 45:46.520]  filled with all forms of hepatitis and HIV micro plasms you name it I've got
[45:46.520 --> 45:50.360]  that report today but info wars.com internal documents leaked by good
[45:50.360 --> 45:58.480]  people inside the government good people in government in 2000 2004 and a few
[45:58.480 --> 46:03.720]  years ago went before Congress 90 plus percent of the EPA scientist as well as
[46:03.720 --> 46:06.400]  a bunch of the FDA scientists went public said take the fluoride out it's
[46:06.400 --> 46:09.920]  causing cancer brain damage and gave the reports that's all on record you never
[46:09.920 --> 46:17.040]  see that on the news they just call you kooks they knowingly are spraying
[46:17.040 --> 46:21.400]  pesticides like fluoride on crops that bio accumulates and goes right through
[46:21.400 --> 46:28.040]  the cell wall of the plant and if it can go through the cell walls of plants what
[46:28.040 --> 46:33.120]  do you think it does to the cell membranes of humans that are incredibly
[46:33.120 --> 46:37.360]  weak compared to a plant cell walls when it goes into your stomach and in and
[46:37.360 --> 46:42.800]  into your liver what do you think it's doing the strongest of us are in a day
[46:42.800 --> 46:47.120]  state when you say the public is in a day state it's like they're on drugs they
[46:47.120 --> 46:52.440]  are on drugs they are on chemicals and and and this is the big curse by the way
[46:52.440 --> 46:57.440]  I forgot to get to this because it came out on info wars.com on Saturday you

[47:12.000 --> 47:16.680]  because that's where all the key articles are in that feed at the TED
[47:16.680 --> 47:23.680]  technology conference in Deutschland in Germany in Berlin Melinda Gates got up
[47:23.680 --> 47:27.080]  and responded to those saying that they're really a covert population
[47:27.080 --> 47:33.760]  reduction program I mean we're really Coney 2012 put a new video encountered
[47:33.760 --> 47:38.120]  myself and others in it again we are hitting on all cylinders we are
[47:38.120 --> 47:41.400]  blasting holes in them ladies and gentlemen you're like well they'll kill
[47:41.400 --> 47:44.560]  the general public won't they kill you because they don't want to validate
[47:44.560 --> 47:50.240]  everything I've said they dropped napalm on me I become a night light I
[47:50.240 --> 48:00.520]  become a white house on the hill because I've already said it all I just
[48:00.520 --> 48:04.440]  repeat it basically and give you the latest data because I've already sent
[48:04.440 --> 48:09.440]  the message because I've already sent the data all they do is smashing me will
[48:09.440 --> 48:14.320]  be feed the Liberty tree they know that and they still may smash me I'm a
[48:14.320 --> 48:17.920]  little selfish and don't want that in my flesh but my spirit says go ahead
[48:17.920 --> 48:23.440]  because let me tell you if I give up my life so that one person one child
[48:23.440 --> 48:27.680]  isn't deformed and doesn't live their life out in a in a wheelchair having
[48:27.680 --> 48:33.120]  trouble living just because you smiley-eyed devils enjoy it and love
[48:33.120 --> 48:37.680]  killing people and get off on hurting children you think I'm worried I just
[48:37.680 --> 48:41.200]  want you to know if you kill me I've already won okay I've already won doing
[48:41.200 --> 48:44.560]  the right thing I've already won fighting you I've already won stand I've
[48:44.560 --> 48:48.360]  already won standing up against you I want you know that you understand that
[48:48.360 --> 48:52.320]  there's nothing you can do to me you can destroy my name you can drag me to
[48:52.320 --> 48:56.440]  the mud you can destroy whatever you want it doesn't matter the transmission
[48:56.440 --> 49:00.960]  has been sent and I already see thousands of blogs and websites imitating
[49:00.960 --> 49:04.680]  and duplicating my research and even making it better and expanding on it
[49:04.680 --> 49:11.200]  and getting into it at a very very deep level so there is such a point of
[49:11.200 --> 49:17.880]  satisfaction knowing you are too late and I'm going to keep on going after I'm
[49:17.880 --> 49:22.000]  dead or if God lets me continue to live and do my work I'm going to continue
[49:22.000 --> 49:26.280]  firing at you and sending out the message but I've already sent out the
[49:26.280 --> 49:33.320]  message it's already been transmitted worldwide globally against you there's
[49:33.320 --> 49:37.960]  the article Melinda Gates worrying about population control has led to too much
[49:37.960 --> 49:42.600]  suffering and death great article by one of our great researchers but I would
[49:42.600 --> 49:45.480]  have gone with the headline and again I don't get to operate as editor most of
[49:45.480 --> 49:50.360]  them was I can't work all the time just like Melinda Gates responds you know
[49:50.360 --> 49:54.920]  Melinda Gates responds to those saying that she's a population control front
[49:54.920 --> 50:00.560]  something like that because again the key is get this read but Melinda Gates
[50:00.560 --> 50:05.200]  worrying about population control has led to much suffering and death and so
[50:05.200 --> 50:08.800]  it's a weird spin she goes on to say worrying about us trying to reduce
[50:08.800 --> 50:16.480]  population is causing suffering and death and there's the quote on screen for
[50:16.480 --> 50:23.480]  folks that are watching okay I've been pretty wound up not doing the Sunday

[55:52.400 --> 55:55.680]  with knives I talked to a Houston cop he saw that and they knew as soon as they
[55:55.680 --> 55:59.840]  got her down that when that they knew they'd find Prozac or one of those
[55:59.840 --> 56:04.120]  variants in the medicine cabinet sure enough it was there it's in the

[01:00:45.400 --> 01:00:49.560]  even gotten to the main bulk of the off-the-chart news and I haven't given
[01:00:49.560 --> 01:00:56.680]  the number I don't want to take a lot of calls today but here is just some of the
[01:00:56.680 --> 01:01:03.440]  news again I'm gonna go over this more later in more detail 110,000 active duty
[01:01:03.440 --> 01:01:07.720]  trips on psychotropics and other mind-control drugs and they're saying
[01:01:07.720 --> 01:01:12.800]  gee could that be why they're running around and attacking police and robbing
[01:01:12.800 --> 01:01:18.080]  things and killing their families and gee going off base at night and killing
[01:01:18.080 --> 01:01:23.040]  18 people and including two-year-old children and setting them on fire oh you
[01:01:23.040 --> 01:01:26.880]  took a guy who's been in four turds of heavy combat and had part of his foot
[01:01:26.880 --> 01:01:31.280]  blown off and asked to not be redeployed and you put him on Prozac and sending
[01:01:31.280 --> 01:01:37.200]  back out there and then a roadside bomb blew up some of his buddies a few days
[01:01:37.200 --> 01:01:43.760]  before and he snapped what you shouldn't give hardcore trained killers who've had
[01:01:43.760 --> 01:01:47.640]  their foot already partly blown off and then their buddies get killed in front
[01:01:47.640 --> 01:01:53.040]  of them you shouldn't put them on a hallucinogenic drug that says it causes
[01:01:53.040 --> 01:01:59.120]  violent violent swings where you don't control yourself and kill people oh you
[01:01:59.120 --> 01:02:04.680]  want to give that to a trained killer that is a really really really good idea
[01:02:04.680 --> 01:02:09.920]  that that that you that's a super duper idea and then you want to give these
[01:02:09.920 --> 01:02:15.400]  drugs to people saying oh you're having anxiety we'll just put you on Xanax I
[01:02:15.400 --> 01:02:20.760]  have a good friend who they put on Xanax and he got pretty crazy on it and it
[01:02:20.760 --> 01:02:25.400]  turned into a big national media circus I'll just leave it at that people can
[01:02:25.400 --> 01:02:28.600]  probably figure out who I'm talking about people are like he's gone crazy
[01:02:28.600 --> 01:02:33.800]  yeah get off the Xanax no longer crazy and a lot of people are like oh Xanax
[01:02:33.800 --> 01:02:42.440]  really is helping me yeah but it's Russian roulette it's Russian roulette
[01:02:42.440 --> 01:02:46.680]  and we live in an unnatural society with GMO chemicals biologicals all the
[01:02:46.680 --> 01:02:50.120]  sentence so we're already having enough problems and they say well we'll put you
[01:02:50.120 --> 01:02:55.080]  on these drugs so you don't notice it anymore and then you don't have that
[01:02:55.080 --> 01:02:57.560]  normal
[01:02:58.560 --> 01:03:02.320]  governor that's in you that's what Prozac and this whole class of drugs do is
[01:03:02.320 --> 01:03:07.520]  that a mother just suddenly in a dream state puts their children one after the
[01:03:07.520 --> 01:03:10.920]  other in the bathtub and holds them under till they die and then dresses them
[01:03:10.920 --> 01:03:14.600]  and puts them in their beds or drives them off a clip or takes their babies
[01:03:14.600 --> 01:03:19.080]  and gets out a big butcher and I've chops their arms and legs off and then
[01:03:19.080 --> 01:03:23.400]  calls the police and says I just didn't know what to do so chop them up like a
[01:03:23.400 --> 01:03:30.760]  chicken you know church moms do it all the time now my doctor put me on Prozac
[01:03:30.760 --> 01:03:34.640]  or Luvox and they pull up the police pull up and there she is in her apron
[01:03:34.640 --> 01:03:45.800]  with a butcher knife hello officer I'm ready to go now and they're gonna send
[01:03:45.800 --> 01:03:52.640]  bales to prison instead of to a mental institution I mean if you slip somebody
[01:03:52.640 --> 01:03:57.200]  three hits of LSD and they have a bad trip and go out and kill two or three
[01:03:57.200 --> 01:04:01.280]  people and people find out that somebody spiked or drank there's actually been
[01:04:01.280 --> 01:04:06.680]  cases this you don't even go to jail folks because someone stuck in the bar
[01:04:06.680 --> 01:04:19.720]  LSD in your drink but the system cannot let this guy go that shot the cop in the
[01:04:19.720 --> 01:04:24.680]  neck and killed him and they can't let sergeant bells go because they can't
[01:04:24.680 --> 01:04:33.680]  indict the Prozac or the other psychotropic that they're on Xanax because
[01:04:33.680 --> 01:04:37.440]  because then see it's always why is everybody killing everybody well we've
[01:04:37.440 --> 01:04:40.040]  got to put checkpoints everywhere to stop this and the guys running the
[01:04:40.040 --> 01:04:43.800]  checkpoints are on the same drug it's like we don't know why breast cancer so
[01:04:43.800 --> 01:04:46.640]  bad we're not gonna look at that we'll just figure out a cure it well why is it
[01:04:46.640 --> 01:04:49.920]  getting wise there's so much more of it it's it's like why are people going

[01:09:09.840 --> 01:09:14.960]  was about two years ago took my paxil that morning and later that night I
[01:09:14.960 --> 01:09:20.680]  drank a glass of wine it was about 10 p.m. when I was told that I armed myself
[01:09:20.680 --> 01:09:25.440]  with a rifle and went for a walk in a neighborhood later the police came I
[01:09:25.440 --> 01:09:29.760]  was surrounded by 12 or so cops so I'm told the cops tried to arrest me but I
[01:09:29.760 --> 01:09:33.280]  told them I ranted and raved about everything and anything about half an
[01:09:33.280 --> 01:09:38.040]  hour ignoring the cops and the guns they were pointing at me I was violently
[01:09:38.040 --> 01:09:43.280]  arrested a few hours later I woke up at a hospital handcuffed to the bed paxil
[01:09:43.280 --> 01:09:48.120]  caused this behavior I have very little memory of that night at all I have
[01:09:48.120 --> 01:09:52.520]  permanent physical injuries as a result of the violent arrest taken from someone
[01:09:52.520 --> 01:09:58.120]  who's been there don't ever put an SSRI in your body and that's true and if you
[01:09:58.120 --> 01:10:02.160]  are already on them you have to go off very slowly that's the number one thing
[01:10:02.160 --> 01:10:07.560]  that causes the total violent mania cuckoo behavior is to go off them quickly
[01:10:07.560 --> 01:10:14.960]  whoa do not go off the medication cold turkey whatever you do the signal like
[01:10:14.960 --> 01:10:18.600]  kicking a coffee and you just get a headache or stopping drinking booze you
[01:10:18.600 --> 01:10:25.120]  get a headache this is crazy person time anyways I was reading a comment from
[01:10:25.120 --> 01:10:29.600]  that article any depressant drugs causing epidemic of mania mayhem and
[01:10:29.600 --> 01:10:35.280]  murder America's addiction to dangerous SSRI's hits crisis level the alleged
[01:10:35.280 --> 01:10:39.800]  shooting of a police officer in Austin the guys are so careful to say alleged
[01:10:39.800 --> 01:10:46.200]  it's on video it's him it's the shooting the cop was shot I wrote this with
[01:10:46.200 --> 01:10:51.600]  Paul will probably change that the alleged shooting no he was shot of a
[01:10:51.600 --> 01:10:57.080]  police officer he's dead of a police officer in Austin by a man taking the
[01:10:57.080 --> 01:11:02.240]  anti-anxiety drug Xanax is just one of a plethora of recent incidents fueled by
[01:11:02.240 --> 01:11:07.080]  anti-depressant pharmaceuticals an epidemic of mania that has swept the
[01:11:07.080 --> 01:11:11.160]  country and the world everywhere this happens
[01:11:12.320 --> 01:11:16.480]  Mary Odell the mother 24-year-old Brandon Montgomery Daniel told the
[01:11:16.480 --> 01:11:21.160]  Associated Press that her son's role in the fatal shooting of Austin senior
[01:11:21.160 --> 01:11:29.240]  police officer Jamie Padrone was fueled by alcohol and psychotropic drugs and
[01:11:29.240 --> 01:11:33.440]  she went on to break it down and we have all the other examples and you have
[01:11:33.440 --> 01:11:35.920]  bails so they won't release it but they're saying the treatment he was
[01:11:35.920 --> 01:11:39.280]  under he was clearly on Prozac they're hiding those records and it's got all
[01:11:39.280 --> 01:11:42.680]  the other shooting examples in the article where it's been that you just
[01:11:42.680 --> 01:11:48.360]  scroll through it all and read it for yourself everybody knows this but look
[01:11:48.360 --> 01:11:58.120]  at this article look look at this article right here a fog of drugs in
[01:11:58.120 --> 01:12:04.320]  war Los Angeles Times more than 110,000 active-duty army troops last year took
[01:12:04.320 --> 01:12:11.120]  anti-depressants and it just goes on to talk about all these pilots all these
[01:12:11.120 --> 01:12:16.040]  military police all these people with no criminal record great service records
[01:12:16.040 --> 01:12:21.000]  doing horrible things assaulting people attacking people going crazy killing
[01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:27.520]  people well yeah the worst idea in the world is to take trained killers like
[01:12:27.520 --> 01:12:33.680]  Sergeant Bales and put him on a serotonin reuptake inhibitor and then he
[01:12:33.680 --> 01:12:38.400]  just breaks down this is a guy who'd already been in four tours had part of
[01:12:38.400 --> 01:12:43.000]  his foot blown off before asked to not be sent back had been in treatment at the
[01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:47.920]  military base in Oregon and then was told he was okay and sent back into
[01:12:47.920 --> 01:13:03.400]  Afghanistan and he's there a few weeks and his buddies his buddies get blown up
[01:13:03.400 --> 01:13:06.560]  in an armored vehicle and then he goes crazy and goes out and shoots a bunch
[01:13:06.560 --> 01:13:10.000]  of people reportedly his lawyers not right now they're not even really
[01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:15.040]  denying he did it now and the point is that no one is discussing the drugs
[01:13:15.040 --> 01:13:19.600]  except for the LA Times and in fact that's actually something I can say I
[01:13:19.600 --> 01:13:28.000]  mean here's the article right here a fog of drugs and war and it goes over all
[01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:33.640]  of that and gives you in five pages a bunch of examples of it that's in the
[01:13:33.640 --> 01:13:45.600]  Los Angeles Times today if you want to go read it okay let me now go ahead and
[01:13:45.600 --> 01:13:49.640]  shift gears into some other areas but everyone's welcome to call in about any
[01:13:49.640 --> 01:13:55.000]  of the subjects I've raised so far any of the issues I'm about to get to the
[01:13:55.000 --> 01:14:02.480]  toll-free number to join us is 800 259 92 31 coming up at the start of the third
[01:14:02.480 --> 01:14:07.720]  hour I'm gonna air video and audio of the new Black Panther Party calling for
[01:14:07.720 --> 01:14:14.440]  blood on the streets and mass race war and again we have the video we're gonna
[01:14:14.440 --> 01:14:19.800]  get it posted at info wars comm and article we already have up there but
[01:14:19.800 --> 01:14:24.880]  this one is a family friendly that has cut out all of the profanity the issue
[01:14:24.880 --> 01:14:33.680]  is is that the Atari militia simply said if the government comes to confiscate
[01:14:33.680 --> 01:14:37.280]  our guns we're gonna have to fight back and gee we hope it doesn't come to that
[01:14:37.280 --> 01:14:41.320]  and they were arrested and held for years and the judges said they're not
[01:14:41.320 --> 01:14:44.160]  guilty release them but the feds of course aren't doing that they're holding
[01:14:44.160 --> 01:14:47.840]  them on weapons charges which are legal guns but they're saying guns the
[01:14:47.840 --> 01:14:52.280]  commission of a crime so the charges have been thrown out for the other crime
[01:14:52.280 --> 01:14:56.200]  but they're saying the guns in the commission of that crime they're gonna
[01:14:56.200 --> 01:15:03.200]  be held for that just like the Davidians were found in the appeals process
[01:15:03.200 --> 01:15:08.400]  even the Supreme Court said release them they're found not guilty of murdering
[01:15:08.400 --> 01:15:14.360]  federal you know police officers and the Fed still held them on using firearms in
[01:15:14.360 --> 01:15:20.280]  the commission of murdering killing federal police but they were found not
[01:15:20.280 --> 01:15:25.400]  guilty of murdering so it's the same thing but but you notice somebody who's
[01:15:25.400 --> 01:15:29.000]  for the Constitution Bill of Rights who isn't racist the Atari weren't into
[01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:35.120]  race stuff they go to jail but I've seen the new black Panthers in Houston the
[01:15:35.120 --> 01:15:42.040]  new black Panthers in Chicago the new black Panthers in DC in Baltimore on
[01:15:42.040 --> 01:15:46.560]  video say we're gonna kill all the white people and we want to start murdering
[01:15:46.560 --> 01:15:52.080]  and shooting them right now now why aren't they being arrested cuz they'll
[01:15:52.080 --> 01:15:56.480]  normally arrest a black guy for walking down the street walking while black they
[01:15:56.480 --> 01:16:00.120]  throw the book at black people like nobody I've seen why because they want
[01:16:00.120 --> 01:16:04.360]  this race war to start ladies and gentlemen where is the Southern
[01:16:04.360 --> 01:16:08.120]  Poverty Law Center in ADL to decry them and say they're calling for violence I
[01:16:08.120 --> 01:16:12.400]  mean they're always saying I'm calling for violence when I'm not they're always
[01:16:12.400 --> 01:16:17.800]  saying I'm gonna cause violence when I'm not it's not gonna help us defeat the
[01:16:17.800 --> 01:16:20.600]  New World Order if every cop in America got a bullet between their eyes in fact
[01:16:20.600 --> 01:16:24.800]  it would help the New World Order I'm not calling for killing police I'm
[01:16:24.800 --> 01:16:29.160]  calling for the opposite I'm not calling for bloodbaths and killing citizens
[01:16:29.160 --> 01:16:37.640]  and let's send a 10,000 man group to arrest George Zimmerman it's pretty
[01:16:37.640 --> 01:16:41.000]  amazing what they say about you know we need to kill the whites and then have
[01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:45.840]  race war and blood and all this and and it's it's just incredible so that's
[01:16:45.840 --> 01:16:59.280]  coming up the next hour I've got some bad news here last week Tuesday or so they
[01:16:59.280 --> 01:17:07.080]  announced that they were gonna pull the US aircraft carriers out of the Gulf the
[01:17:07.080 --> 01:17:12.880]  Persian Gulf and that Israel was gonna stop or scale back internal low
[01:17:12.880 --> 01:17:16.680]  intensity conflict they call it inside Iran that's that's warfare ladies and
[01:17:16.680 --> 01:17:22.600]  gentlemen anybody does that to us we call it terrorism and Watson wrote the
[01:17:22.600 --> 01:17:27.920]  article saying last aircraft carrier leaving well that was all a ruse they
[01:17:27.920 --> 01:17:31.600]  had another aircraft carrier show up two aircraft carriers leave and now all
[01:17:31.600 --> 01:17:38.920]  three are going in and everything's on full alert just like they told Assad
[01:17:38.920 --> 01:17:43.720]  okay ceasefire our peaceful activists will stop blowing up police stations and
[01:17:43.720 --> 01:17:47.520]  rocket attacking and as soon as Assad stood down they just launched attacks
[01:17:47.520 --> 01:17:51.960]  with US and Israeli and British forces backing them not not even so much
[01:17:51.960 --> 01:17:54.880]  Israeli but there's someone involved they're really involved in the Libya
[01:17:54.880 --> 01:18:02.440]  thing attacking from all angles just just it's pure deception problem is if you
[01:18:02.440 --> 01:18:04.680]  ever actually want to make a deal with somebody they won't listen to you because
[01:18:04.680 --> 01:18:08.920]  they know you're just there's the globalists don't even do stuff that's
[01:18:08.920 --> 01:18:14.000]  honorable when it would serve them you've got to say they are true to their
[01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:19.640]  their bad character US Navy deploys second aircraft carrier the Gulf and
[01:18:19.640 --> 01:18:23.680]  there's another just just down south of that not technically in it the US Navy
[01:18:23.680 --> 01:18:26.920]  said Monday is deployed a second aircraft carrier the Persian Gulf I meant
[01:18:26.920 --> 01:18:30.680]  rising tension with Iran over its disputed nuclear program so they were
[01:18:30.680 --> 01:18:34.360]  announcing they were pulling out to one left the area another was there now
[01:18:34.360 --> 01:18:40.120]  another's going in the deployment of the nuclear-powered USS Enterprise one of
[01:18:40.120 --> 01:18:43.800]  the Abraham Lincoln carrier strike group marks only the fourth time in the
[01:18:43.800 --> 01:18:47.600]  past decade the Navy has had two aircraft carriers operating at the same
[01:18:47.600 --> 01:18:53.280]  time of the Persian Gulf and the Arabian Sea said the commander Amy Derek
[01:18:53.280 --> 01:18:58.120]  Frost of the Bahrain base fifth fleet the two carriers will support the American
[01:18:58.120 --> 01:19:02.280]  military operations in Afghanistan and anti-piracy efforts off Somali coast and
[01:19:02.280 --> 01:19:08.360]  the Gulf of Aden she said yeah right and it goes on to what they've got a carrier
[01:19:08.360 --> 01:19:15.760]  in the med and another out there in the larger sea below there so all of that's
[01:19:15.760 --> 01:19:24.840]  going on right now okay when we get back I'm gonna start going to phone calls for
[01:19:24.840 --> 01:19:28.640]  a while and then I'll get into Melinda Gates worrying about population control

[01:19:43.440 --> 01:19:48.680]  James Hansen previously advocated environmental terrorism and that
[01:19:48.680 --> 01:19:53.800]  integrates him with this other huge report on MIT saying they're gonna
[01:19:53.800 --> 01:19:58.040]  collapse the economy and kill 90% of the public I'm not kidding it's all out in
[01:19:58.040 --> 01:20:03.200]  the oven stay with us I'd seen the ungevity products work for many others
[01:20:03.200 --> 01:20:06.640]  and so I bought a bunch of them started using them had a little bit of results
[01:20:06.640 --> 01:20:11.760]  but I wasn't following the regimen every day but Aaron Dykes in my office did and
[01:20:11.760 --> 01:20:16.640]  lost more than 60 pounds when I saw those results I said I better follow my own

[01:25:12.440 --> 01:25:19.080]  this that's coming up new Black Panther Party this is just what we need the
[01:25:19.080 --> 01:25:24.480]  globalists are attacking and killing everybody I never hear the Black Panthers
[01:25:24.480 --> 01:25:29.520]  say don't abort 52% of black babies now it's just too much fun to talk about
[01:25:29.520 --> 01:25:32.880]  killing whites all day and that's the globalists they've created the big
[01:25:32.880 --> 01:25:38.040]  prison culture where if you're white you've got to go join the supremacist
[01:25:38.040 --> 01:25:40.560]  or basically get killed if you're Hispanic you've got to go join the
[01:25:40.560 --> 01:25:44.240]  Hispanic supremacist or get killed if you're black you've got to go join the
[01:25:44.240 --> 01:25:49.120]  black supremacist or get killed basically in the more serious pens pen
[01:25:49.120 --> 01:25:58.640]  attention trees and so you go in there for a minor crime or nonviolent crime
[01:25:58.640 --> 01:26:05.520]  you come out in five years with a degree in criminality and you can't get jobs
[01:26:05.520 --> 01:26:09.120]  regular places so you work for the criminal underground that works in most
[01:26:09.120 --> 01:26:21.000]  cases for the system by the way I want to say hi to Chuck Norris he writes
[01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:25.440]  articles on a monthly basis for world that daily and in quotes info wars
[01:26:25.440 --> 01:26:32.640]  calm and quotes quotes Alex Jones here yours truly and sets the record
[01:26:32.640 --> 01:26:35.520]  straight because world that daily written articles saying oh this executive
[01:26:35.520 --> 01:26:38.720]  order for martial laws no big deal we've always had this on the books
[01:26:38.720 --> 01:26:49.000]  for a nuclear attack if the Congress is all killed not for something like an
[01:26:49.000 --> 01:26:53.520]  economic crisis or the threat of a crisis and he points that out and he
[01:26:53.520 --> 01:26:56.720]  also points out members of Congress saying it and here's the Orlando
[01:26:56.720 --> 01:27:03.000]  Sentinel saying it Orlando's rep Adams fears Obama power grab I want to get
[01:27:03.000 --> 01:27:08.480]  Adams on word to the producer please thank you another Congress person we
[01:27:08.480 --> 01:27:18.160]  had we had that congressman from North Carolina on what Jones about this a few
[01:27:18.160 --> 01:27:24.200]  weeks ago who's standing up to it so this is this is real people like oh
[01:27:24.200 --> 01:27:27.560]  there's been executive orders for the government to take over everything since
[01:27:27.560 --> 01:27:34.600]  1950 yeah in a nuclear war not for any crises including the threat of a crisis
[01:27:34.600 --> 01:27:39.700]  including economic or otherwise this is not something that's been on the books a
[01:27:39.700 --> 01:27:45.040]  long time this is new just like in the AA is new to secretly arrest us just like
[01:27:45.040 --> 01:27:48.000]  the tortures new the last two administrations just like the secret
[01:27:48.000 --> 01:27:55.360]  arrest is new just like all these wars without congressional approval is new
[01:27:55.360 --> 01:28:00.480]  and by the way the Chuck Norris's said I cover it later I'm discovering it now
[01:28:00.480 --> 01:28:06.200]  there's credit he goes on to say yes Bush engaged in imperial expansion
[01:28:06.200 --> 01:28:11.880]  behavior and power grabbing that was wrong but Obama is focusing this in
[01:28:11.880 --> 01:28:15.360]  domestically the paraphrase Chuck Norris you can go read it he's absolutely
[01:28:15.360 --> 01:28:18.280]  dead on I know Chuck when I first interviewed him I don't know six seven
[01:28:18.280 --> 01:28:27.880]  years ago said he'd been a listener for since the mid 90s
[01:28:27.880 --> 01:28:36.400]  she's got several ranches in Texas and then I've interviewed him quite a few
[01:28:36.400 --> 01:28:42.360]  times and then of course we got his phone number once and a previous producer
[01:28:42.360 --> 01:28:46.920]  years ago I guess or I didn't or something get it in the computer
[01:28:46.920 --> 01:28:50.920]  properly and now the email I have doesn't work so word out to Chuck Norris
[01:28:50.920 --> 01:28:54.200]  we'd like to get you back on the show Chuck I know you're a listener and I
[01:28:54.200 --> 01:28:57.560]  appreciate you standing up and pointing out this is a power grab but it's not
[01:28:57.560 --> 01:29:00.960]  just Chuck here because we had a bunch of neoconsights come on say everything's
[01:29:00.960 --> 01:29:06.560]  fine sure Obama says he can basically suspend Congress and take over resources
[01:29:06.560 --> 01:29:11.960]  and all this for the threat of a crisis but that's no big deal oh really well
[01:29:11.960 --> 01:29:16.160]  congressman Jones isn't listening and congressman Adams knows what's going on
[01:29:16.160 --> 01:29:22.720]  Orlando reps Adams fears Obama power grab a White House order updating
[01:29:22.720 --> 01:29:26.200]  federal emergency powers has raised alarm among some conservative commentators
[01:29:26.200 --> 01:29:31.800]  the US representative Sandy Adams the president Obama is attempting to grab
[01:29:31.800 --> 01:29:35.480]  unconstitutional powers and it goes through that okay that's coming up
[01:29:35.480 --> 01:29:42.720]  later I promise your phone calls coming up then we'll get into government

[01:33:35.560 --> 01:33:41.280]  want to reduce population by more than 90% and now the top research team at MIT
[01:33:41.280 --> 01:33:48.480]  officially is projecting we just did the math back there a 96% population
[01:33:48.480 --> 01:33:54.920]  reduction people are always what is it 80 90 you get your facts mr. baloney man
[01:33:54.920 --> 01:33:59.360]  get them right I'm like well the UN says 80 the biological diversity

[01:34:36.880 --> 01:34:41.360]  like Arnold Schwarzenegger when I was doing research on him for my film
[01:34:41.360 --> 01:34:44.320]  martial law because he's part of the film and they were pushing him for
[01:34:44.320 --> 01:34:47.960]  presidents how disgusting that was is this his favorite artist because it
[01:34:47.960 --> 01:34:51.400]  showed him visiting him in Germany is a guy that shows little kids killed in
[01:34:51.400 --> 01:34:56.560]  car wrecks and then like seven-year-old girls dressed in Nazi uniforms laying
[01:34:56.560 --> 01:35:01.440]  out on beds I mean they're dressed but it's like you know super creepy and you
[01:35:01.440 --> 01:35:08.000]  see all the Ralph Lauren and all them have run ad campaigns you know and well
[01:35:08.000 --> 01:35:11.440]  there's some they're even worse than Ralph Lauren did mildly years ago or was
[01:35:11.440 --> 01:35:17.320]  it Calvin Klein I forget and you're like why would anyone want a year old baby
[01:35:17.320 --> 01:35:22.240]  run over by a truck a photograph of that you know it's head all smashed eyeballs
[01:35:22.240 --> 01:35:28.760]  hanging out Schwarzenegger gets on a private jet and flies to Europe to
[01:35:28.760 --> 01:35:36.200]  stare at this and buy it there's your answer okay and that's part of the
[01:35:36.200 --> 01:35:39.560]  course if you look in the New York Times they've done reports on it the most
[01:35:39.560 --> 01:35:47.360]  popular art in New York bought by the rich Wall Street people is a flash a
[01:35:47.360 --> 01:35:56.440]  gold-lined jar crystal jar with semen and blood in it hate to get grossers this
[01:35:56.440 --> 01:36:01.320]  is this is who rules things and they'll pay 15 million for that and they ask
[01:36:01.320 --> 01:36:07.760]  them why they say it is a commitment to this it's it's an offering and the
[01:36:07.760 --> 01:36:12.560]  artists are always you know self mutilating with weird black spiked
[01:36:12.560 --> 01:36:19.280]  hair and totally white and think they're vampires what is that article you guys
[01:36:19.280 --> 01:36:24.120]  pulled up let me see Arnold Schwarzenegger hands back Nazi loot now
[01:36:24.120 --> 01:36:29.440]  that's not it that's not it that's just some other some other thing he's up to
[01:36:29.440 --> 01:36:34.720]  you love Kurt Volta one of the top Nazis the point is is that I remember it was
[01:36:34.720 --> 01:36:43.120]  like 47 million dollars for a skull encrusted with diamonds or you know a
[01:36:43.120 --> 01:36:48.360]  million and a half dollars for a crucifix submerged in pus with a
[01:36:48.360 --> 01:36:53.520]  garnish of maggots I mean these are real things and they go and fight with
[01:36:53.520 --> 01:36:57.840]  each other bidding over it so up in their giant you know 50 million dollar
[01:36:57.840 --> 01:37:03.240]  high-rise you know three-story level penthouses with their models and
[01:37:03.240 --> 01:37:06.960]  everybody coming to visit them I'm going to your calls in a moment they can I'll
[01:37:06.960 --> 01:37:10.800]  never forget I was watching PBS with Jack Kevorkian before he went to prison
[01:37:10.800 --> 01:37:16.640]  this has got to be 20 years ago more than 20 years ago because I was I was in
[01:37:16.640 --> 01:37:25.080]  high school hmm do the math as about 21 years ago as a senior in high school at
[01:37:25.080 --> 01:37:29.400]  my parents house we moved here to Austin and I'm watching PBS and it's Jack
[01:37:29.400 --> 01:37:38.040]  Kevorkian and it shows at the New York art display it shows all these movie
[01:37:38.040 --> 01:37:48.680]  stars and the supermodels and at the event that they cut to a shot of who's
[01:37:48.680 --> 01:37:55.960]  the famous Scientologist I'm drawing a blank here who's in Top Gun Tom Cruz yeah
[01:37:55.960 --> 01:37:59.800]  yeah yeah Tom Cruz I'm starting visioning and seeing that TV program and
[01:37:59.800 --> 01:38:03.360]  then I can't remember basic names because I'm accessing old memory the point is
[01:38:03.360 --> 01:38:08.240]  is that they're there and these women these supermodels are sitting there and
[01:38:08.240 --> 01:38:12.200]  Jack Kevorkian I'll ever forget was in this powder blue suit with all these
[01:38:12.200 --> 01:38:15.940]  beautiful women around him like he was a rock star but they understand they
[01:38:15.940 --> 01:38:20.920]  don't like it they have to worship it to be in those elite circles it was all
[01:38:20.920 --> 01:38:26.360]  real fake but but but it's about the worshiping of a weird ghoulish man and
[01:38:26.360 --> 01:38:35.000]  it was his art display and he was it was demons painted in his own blood as part
[01:38:35.000 --> 01:38:38.680]  of the medium and it was like a baby coming out of a woman and the demons
[01:38:38.680 --> 01:38:42.960]  eating it and and and just the most horrible stuff you can imagine and
[01:38:42.960 --> 01:38:50.160]  there's all these supermodels coming with Jack Kevorkian and him this
[01:38:50.160 --> 01:38:57.280]  ghoulish Crip Keeper type ghoul nerd who's this civil rights person they're
[01:38:57.280 --> 01:39:03.200]  saying going I painted it with ampoules of my own blood and smacking his lips
[01:39:03.200 --> 01:39:12.160]  and the women going this is who runs things okay and if you don't get that
[01:39:12.160 --> 01:39:17.000]  you don't understand they feel power when they think about your child
[01:39:17.000 --> 01:39:22.040]  injectable cancer viruses I don't think Tom Cruise was he was just that on this
[01:39:22.040 --> 01:39:25.640]  newscast I saw I guess coming to the art display because I know I'm not saying
[01:39:25.640 --> 01:39:28.680]  he's perfect but he's spoken out against prozac and stuff hurting your brain I'm
[01:39:28.680 --> 01:39:34.160]  not the point is is that this is what they do they hop around at these events
[01:39:34.160 --> 01:39:38.760]  and all get off on the fact that they're into killing people and into death I
[01:39:38.760 --> 01:39:43.520]  mean look at this article at info wars.com genocide endorsing climate
[01:39:43.520 --> 01:39:48.440]  alarmist calls for global tax on carbon emissions he's the number three guy at
[01:39:48.440 --> 01:39:55.720]  NASA he's their head climatologist over a bunch of the satellite systems and
[01:39:55.720 --> 01:39:59.960]  he's always endorsing world government population control a worldwide police
[01:39:59.960 --> 01:40:05.280]  state drugs in the water because he knows best it's all about the power
[01:40:05.280 --> 01:40:11.680]  trip see if you really want to be on a power trip you've got to be killing

[01:40:38.800 --> 01:40:42.840]  and we're able to dig up some of the real porno magazine covers gay magazines
[01:40:42.840 --> 01:40:45.760]  that he was on the cover of and stuff and we put some of those blurted out in
[01:40:45.760 --> 01:40:48.960]  martial law you've you've seen it and that's when we just came across
[01:40:48.960 --> 01:40:55.600]  Schwarzenegger at the at visiting Germany and quote his favorite artist and
[01:40:55.600 --> 01:41:02.520]  photos of him and him there purchasing the art of the dead babies that was on

[01:47:52.040 --> 01:47:57.520]  some kind of math thigh up here and I remember this this took place about 13
[01:47:57.520 --> 01:48:01.840]  years ago back during the Kosovo incident with Bill Clinton one morning I
[01:48:01.840 --> 01:48:05.280]  think it was on the good morning America I was with I was with the house with my
[01:48:05.280 --> 01:48:10.280]  mother and I got up and this showed this picture is that two Kosovars in a
[01:48:10.280 --> 01:48:15.760]  prison camp and the picture was was it was actually a picture taken 40 years
[01:48:15.760 --> 01:48:20.600]  ago of two Jewish men looking out of a concentration camp during World War two
[01:48:20.600 --> 01:48:24.520]  in their night shirts and I looked at my mother and I said look I got a book in
[01:48:24.520 --> 01:48:28.080]  here World War two and color that's right they showed fake photos saying the
[01:48:28.080 --> 01:48:32.000]  Serbs had done it and it was color photos of people at a camp and then they
[01:48:32.000 --> 01:48:36.240]  also that got caught they staged a shot of a man with tuberculosis and then had
[01:48:36.240 --> 01:48:39.640]  him come to one of the UN facilities that had the food behind wires and said
[01:48:39.640 --> 01:48:45.080]  that was the case NBC got caught editing the tape to have George Zimmerman you
[01:48:45.080 --> 01:48:48.600]  know making it sound like yeah he looks like he's up to no good because he's
[01:48:48.600 --> 01:48:52.760]  black and the real tape is they're like sir what color is he does he look black
[01:48:52.760 --> 01:48:57.800]  Hispanic white he looks black yeah he's looking at you know he's looking in
[01:48:57.800 --> 01:49:01.200]  things doing things like he's on drugs are up to no good they edit together
[01:49:01.200 --> 01:49:04.800]  like yeah he's black he's up to no good because he's black I mean I mean this
[01:49:04.800 --> 01:49:10.760]  is what they do Alex I got this old book here I bought back in 96 it was by a
[01:49:10.760 --> 01:49:15.000]  man named Thomas Chittum Civil War two the coming breakup of America and I
[01:49:15.000 --> 01:49:19.400]  remember when I got it I read through it and I told some people my family about
[01:49:19.400 --> 01:49:24.680]  it they said you're crazy everything this man said in this book about racial
[01:49:24.680 --> 01:49:29.680]  separate separate groups mass riots for days and days yeah by the way I want to
[01:49:29.680 --> 01:49:34.040]  carry that book and I want him on the show is he's still around didn't he I'm
[01:49:34.040 --> 01:49:39.560]  not sure but I will say this I think there is a guy that comes on George
[01:49:39.560 --> 01:49:45.400]  Norrie shows sometimes it talks about microwave attack through radio waves and
[01:49:45.400 --> 01:49:49.400]  you know I kind of wonder about this because I have the epileptic seizures
[01:49:49.400 --> 01:49:53.880]  and neurological disorders are off the chart mainly from the chemicals but
[01:49:53.880 --> 01:49:57.520]  it's also frequency pollution yeah frequency pollution this is what I was
[01:49:57.520 --> 01:50:02.480]  talking about is that I sometimes wonder if the things going on in this country
[01:50:02.480 --> 01:50:06.440]  with murders and things are not sometimes being started with this
[01:50:06.440 --> 01:50:10.220]  frequency pollution because I'm going to tell you what I mean we're just having
[01:50:10.220 --> 01:50:15.160]  strange things seemingly break out ever so they've got now close to 20% of the
[01:50:15.160 --> 01:50:21.920]  population 10% of the military or more are on psychotropic that cause you to
[01:50:21.920 --> 01:50:26.560]  not have impulse control I mean it's on the insert it causes violent attacks and
[01:50:26.560 --> 01:50:31.840]  murder and mayhem and I mean so Bales was under psychiatric treatment begged to
[01:50:31.840 --> 01:50:35.560]  not go back was on drugs but they won't release the details and there's they're
[01:50:35.560 --> 01:50:40.560]  going to send him to prison when they put a trained killer on a drug that makes
[01:50:40.560 --> 01:50:45.200]  you go psycho and I'm not saying you know that he's a perfect guy but you can't
[01:50:45.200 --> 01:50:50.760]  you can't put somebody on crazy drugs the guy that shot the cop last week was
[01:50:50.760 --> 01:50:57.800]  in a Xanax fit that it causes I mean he was temporarily insane of course he
[01:50:57.800 --> 01:51:05.840]  was a little over a year ago I began to do a lot of research into why even if I
[01:51:05.840 --> 01:51:09.640]  had a pretty good sized meal that I was still starving and my research led me to
[01:51:09.640 --> 01:51:13.720]  a well-known fact that most of the soils that we grow our crops on here in the
[01:51:13.720 --> 01:51:17.080]  United States and across the industrialized world are almost completely

[01:53:57.440 --> 01:54:00.800]  powered by science
[01:54:00.800 --> 01:54:14.960]  in 1814 we took a little trip along with Colonel Jackson down to mighty
[01:54:14.960 --> 01:54:19.200]  Mississippi we took a little bacon and we took a little beans and we caught the
[01:54:19.200 --> 01:54:23.480]  bloody British in a town in New Orleans we fired our guns and the British kept
[01:54:23.480 --> 01:54:28.240]  becoming there was a nice many as there was a while ago we fired once more and
[01:54:28.240 --> 01:54:35.960]  they begin to run it down to Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico by the way a bunch
[01:54:35.960 --> 01:54:40.400]  of the office is freaking out as they went and searched the term jack of
[01:54:40.400 --> 01:54:44.680]  working in art and it's demons eating babies people having their heads chopped
[01:54:44.680 --> 01:54:48.760]  up and eating on banquet tables I mean that's what he was into I don't I'm not
[01:54:48.760 --> 01:54:55.320]  making this up I mean I went through the torture of searching out Schwarzenegger
[01:54:55.320 --> 01:55:02.240]  and his gay porn exploits that's true too that's why he's so easily blackmailed
[01:55:02.240 --> 01:55:06.720]  and most of it is in a rich guy's private collection and has not been
[01:55:06.720 --> 01:55:13.720]  released but the point is any of this stuff I bring up is it's all real I
[01:55:13.720 --> 01:55:20.800]  mean do you understand that when I tell you MIT says over 90% of us will be dead
[01:55:20.800 --> 01:55:26.200]  that's an article info wars.com with a link to the Smithsonian Institute to the
[01:55:26.200 --> 01:55:33.680]  UN to the Club of Rome and to MIT I mean I understand this all sounds crazy I
[01:55:33.680 --> 01:55:40.040]  got it I get it it's real I'm not the one that's crazy I'm the one marveling at
[01:55:40.040 --> 01:55:45.040]  it and believe me it's not fun searching out
[01:55:45.040 --> 01:55:49.200]  Swartz and Eggers stuff like I said I was looking for the porno magazines he
[01:55:49.200 --> 01:55:58.720]  was in and found him buying up art of kids around her by trucks I mean again
[01:55:58.720 --> 01:56:04.720]  he's just by the way I've looked for that again and couldn't find it and we
[01:56:04.720 --> 01:56:07.200]  didn't put it in the film just because it was just it was like and here's
[01:56:07.200 --> 01:56:12.560]  Schwarzenegger buying art of you know dead babies the point is it's out there
[01:56:12.560 --> 01:56:15.120]  somebody try to find it it's harder you can find the Kevorkian stuff in five

[01:57:32.400 --> 01:57:39.280]  kill the babies and this is and well their main deal that they're gonna do is

[01:57:44.960 --> 01:57:49.960]  analysis where they steal your genes yeah they steal your blood at birth put
[01:57:49.960 --> 01:57:54.160]  it in a global database now for 40-plus years globally and then when you go

[02:00:49.440 --> 02:00:53.960]  Pennsylvania thanks for holding her on the air hey Alex how are you doing all
[02:00:53.960 --> 02:00:58.960]  right new for ten years can you hear me okay yes sir I can um I found a clip on
[02:00:58.960 --> 02:01:04.960]  YouTube of you cursing at a guy using the F word on air because simply because
[02:01:04.960 --> 02:01:08.120]  you mentioned Benjamin Friedman and Jack Bernstein who I don't know yet who
[02:01:08.120 --> 02:01:12.400]  they are but can you explain that to me please sir I remember that was about five
[02:01:12.400 --> 02:01:18.320]  years ago it's that it's that guy from ProThink and I was in overdrive and I
[02:01:18.320 --> 02:01:23.320]  just had a big piece of equipment break and then some news about one of my
[02:01:23.320 --> 02:01:30.080]  family members getting cancer that's all I'm gonna say and I was gonna cancel
[02:01:30.080 --> 02:01:33.840]  doing that hour but it was the first day of overdrive show the person called up
[02:01:33.840 --> 02:01:39.280]  and I just purely vented on them for no reason and I didn't even know who those
[02:01:39.280 --> 02:01:43.400]  people were later I went and looked up what they had to say so it was just
[02:01:43.400 --> 02:01:49.960]  completely you know wrong time and and I lost control of myself and people are
[02:01:49.960 --> 02:01:53.440]  like wow who is this guy but if the guy wanted to get attention for what he
[02:01:53.440 --> 02:01:58.880]  wanted I would gave him a great gift but it was just purely absolutely you know
[02:01:58.880 --> 02:02:02.600]  half-cocked when I knew the guy was he was calling and so I was a little bit
[02:02:02.600 --> 02:02:05.080]  irritated with him just because I he said some things about me that thought
[02:02:05.080 --> 02:02:11.240]  weren't fair but then I just blew up so there there's the big secret of that
[02:02:11.240 --> 02:02:16.120]  does an answer question the only part of the way because see I've been I've been
[02:02:16.120 --> 02:02:21.480]  I tripped I'm a truth seeker and I found out that Albert Pike said that when
[02:02:21.480 --> 02:02:25.480]  the elite when the people need a hero we will supply him and I also found a clip
[02:02:25.480 --> 02:02:29.160]  that said that's who you are you are a plant by the New World Order you are
[02:02:29.160 --> 02:02:32.560]  actually working for them which I actually wondered when I started listening
[02:02:32.560 --> 02:02:36.400]  to you what why isn't this guy dead why are you supposed to all the secrets but
[02:02:36.400 --> 02:02:39.920]  you ain't you but that's because you're working for the New World Order is that
[02:02:39.920 --> 02:02:43.480]  possible there is a video clip that's like an hour long and I think it's the
[02:02:43.480 --> 02:02:47.280]  best dinner have you ever done with David Ike called this isn't a bloody game
[02:02:47.280 --> 02:02:52.680]  and the last 10 minutes we address this you know people always say address why
[02:02:52.680 --> 02:02:58.760]  you're not dead I've probably addressed that five no no that's a thousand
[02:02:58.760 --> 02:03:02.760]  times on air in in in the last decade because I mean I dress it like every
[02:03:02.760 --> 02:03:05.840]  week a couple times a week so how many times is that over the years I mean it's
[02:03:05.840 --> 02:03:10.880]  a lot I have addressed why I'm still alive have you not ever heard me address
[02:03:10.880 --> 02:03:15.600]  why I'm still alive can you hear me sir come on I can hear you can you hear me
[02:03:15.600 --> 02:03:19.160]  I don't know when I got caught off or not hold on a minute come on let's be
[02:03:19.160 --> 02:03:22.600]  normal because you guys that like to disagree and say I'm all these things I
[02:03:22.600 --> 02:03:26.960]  actually really care about you and I want to really talk to you okay so listen
[02:03:26.960 --> 02:03:30.160]  have you not heard me answer that question literally probably a thousand
[02:03:30.160 --> 02:03:36.760]  times hold on hold on if you want to attack me you I'll let you talk on
[02:03:36.760 --> 02:03:41.200]  air and attack me okay I'll hold you over and you can attack me but have a
[02:03:41.200 --> 02:03:47.640]  dialogue man come on really have you not heard me answer that question before do
[02:03:47.640 --> 02:03:51.640]  I need to answer it for you again because people say you won't answer this
[02:03:51.640 --> 02:03:56.640]  question most these questions I've answered 50 to 100 or more times have
[02:03:56.640 --> 02:04:05.400]  you not heard me explain why I'm still alive there you go hold on hold on if
[02:04:05.400 --> 02:04:08.720]  you disrespect me like this I'm not going to talk to you anymore you want to
[02:04:08.720 --> 02:04:12.400]  call up with accusations I answered one of your questions you moved on to the
[02:04:12.400 --> 02:04:19.320]  next thing okay I am critical of what Israel does in many respects I I I don't
[02:04:19.320 --> 02:04:23.280]  hate Israel or the Jewish people that's the difference and I'm not obsessed with
[02:04:23.280 --> 02:04:26.000]  it quite friendly it's sick of hearing about it all the time I've been attacked
[02:04:26.000 --> 02:04:30.600]  by the ADL all of it but I don't care okay I know I'm a good person my fruits
[02:04:30.600 --> 02:04:34.720]  are good I've woken up more people than anybody else and I appreciate your call
[02:04:34.720 --> 02:04:38.200]  but I'll answer your question again because you wouldn't say about answered
[02:04:38.200 --> 02:04:42.520]  it okay you must not have heard me it would highlight everything I've said I
[02:04:42.520 --> 02:04:46.240]  said this in the first hour by the way if I was killed it would underline
[02:04:46.240 --> 02:04:49.040]  everything I've done and there's providence I have a lot of people praying
[02:04:49.040 --> 02:04:53.240]  for me okay and they've tried to put me in prison and stuff by the grace of God
[02:04:53.240 --> 02:04:58.120]  I'm still here I'm still here because we're effective and if they kill me
[02:04:58.120 --> 02:05:03.760]  it'll make me a martyr I had tried everything I'd cut back the amount of
[02:05:03.760 --> 02:05:08.120]  food I was eating I was lifting weights and jogging but nothing was working my
[02:05:08.120 --> 02:05:12.000]  body was literally starving for minerals and trace elements as well as key
[02:05:12.000 --> 02:05:17.000]  vitamins and as soon as I had that I immediately could eat half of what I was
[02:05:17.000 --> 02:05:21.520]  eating previously and be satisfied now there are hundreds of great products at

[02:08:24.560 --> 02:08:28.640]  okay we're gonna continue with calls in this segment and then I've got to get
[02:08:28.640 --> 02:08:34.920]  to this audio of the new black Panther Party calling for blood and streets
[02:08:34.920 --> 02:08:39.480]  today and they've been calling for this over and over again which is yelling
[02:08:39.480 --> 02:08:44.480]  fire in a theater or going out and calling for insurrection it is calling
[02:08:44.480 --> 02:08:48.920]  for bloodshed it's one thing to say if the government keeps pushing they're
[02:08:48.920 --> 02:08:52.880]  gonna get a revolution then they go and arrest the Atari militia people and
[02:08:52.880 --> 02:08:56.840]  throw them under the jail but when you've got actual groups running around
[02:08:56.840 --> 02:09:01.640]  calling for violent uprisings and like Mecha and La Raza calling for the take
[02:09:01.640 --> 02:09:05.200]  over the Southwest and pulling down American flags and all this the government's
[02:09:05.200 --> 02:09:09.560]  like oh isn't that sweet because the government is run by traders that want
[02:09:09.560 --> 02:09:14.640]  to bring this country down so that is coming up also Aaron just found more
[02:09:14.640 --> 02:09:19.320]  MIT information they've got a new report out saying world population will be
[02:09:19.320 --> 02:09:25.280]  reduced by over 90% this is MIT worse they give reasons your resources are
[02:09:25.280 --> 02:09:29.080]  about to be caught off and there'll be new diseases oh who's cutting our
[02:09:29.080 --> 02:09:33.240]  resources off and other documents shang they're the ones cutting it off but in
[02:09:33.240 --> 02:09:38.640]  this it's like get ready for doom and disaster in the next you know 15 years
[02:09:38.640 --> 02:09:43.720]  or so oh and everybody but then the media will be like isn't it incredible that
[02:09:43.720 --> 02:09:50.720]  MIT in 2012 predicted all this she it's good to have them in charge so that's
[02:09:50.720 --> 02:09:58.200]  coming up as well but right now let's go to John in Texas John welcome
[02:09:58.200 --> 02:10:05.880]  hi Alex hey buddy you know back in the mid 1960s I was in high school I lived
[02:10:05.880 --> 02:10:10.240]  the hours north of Detroit when the Detroit riots broke out and it got so
[02:10:10.240 --> 02:10:15.640]  bad that they had to set the regular army in to help put it down and when
[02:10:15.640 --> 02:10:20.880]  when I've got to Vietnam in 1970 I had a friend of mine over there was a career
[02:10:20.880 --> 02:10:24.040]  soldier he was one of soldiers they sent into Detroit and he used to tell me you
[02:10:24.040 --> 02:10:28.120]  think this is bad you should have been in Detroit and I talked to another guy
[02:10:28.120 --> 02:10:32.240]  that lived on the suburbs right on the outside Detroit needs to him and his
[02:10:32.240 --> 02:10:35.400]  neighbors went out in the front yard and dug foxholes and got their weapons out
[02:10:35.400 --> 02:10:39.600]  and dug in you know but uh well I mean that's the thing what's so ridiculous
[02:10:39.600 --> 02:10:43.360]  about the Black Panther new back the new Black Panther party leader saying
[02:10:43.360 --> 02:10:47.480]  they're gonna have a race war with Whitey all that's gonna happen is is that
[02:10:47.480 --> 02:10:51.240]  the idiots that go out and do this are gonna burn down their own neighborhoods
[02:10:51.240 --> 02:10:55.320]  and infrastructure and businesses so there's no jobs for anybody and then
[02:10:55.320 --> 02:10:58.200]  they're gonna shoot at the firemen and police department people like they've
[02:10:58.200 --> 02:11:02.200]  done in LA and stuff and the cops are gonna shoot back and kill a bunch of
[02:11:02.200 --> 02:11:06.480]  people and the cops are gonna pull back to be politically correct and I mean
[02:11:06.480 --> 02:11:11.160]  that's ridiculous if a foreign army say came out in the countryside where I live
[02:11:11.160 --> 02:11:18.000]  at I'm pro-gun but it's almost annoying that Saturday and Sunday and usually any
[02:11:18.000 --> 02:11:24.720]  evening it's weapons fire continually and sounds like Armageddon I mean I've got
[02:11:24.720 --> 02:11:29.960]  neighbors on both sides of me where five hours you're outside with the kids
[02:11:29.960 --> 02:11:46.880]  trying to dig in the sandbox for five hours and again the good old boys that
[02:11:46.880 --> 02:11:50.760]  have all pulled out to the bushes to they're not actually waiting out there
[02:11:50.760 --> 02:11:56.480]  for a race war with black guys they know about the collapse of society and of
[02:11:56.480 --> 02:12:00.520]  any you know hordes of city flickers come out there I think they're gonna rob
[02:12:00.520 --> 02:12:06.320]  anybody it's gonna be a complete bloodbath so it's just total mindlessness
[02:12:06.320 --> 02:12:11.720]  disconnected from reality to say that anyone is gonna come into the country
[02:12:11.720 --> 02:12:18.640]  side and kill Whitey Whitey is is so dug in with weaponry and so ready to start
[02:12:18.640 --> 02:12:25.720]  killing and make your head spin so it's very very sad because everybody's being
[02:12:25.720 --> 02:12:29.040]  attacked by the globalist the globalist are shutting our economy off and they
[02:12:29.040 --> 02:12:32.200]  want us to fight with each other instead of getting our country back and
[02:12:32.200 --> 02:12:37.360]  that's why the government has MSNBC editing tapes to make it sound like
[02:12:37.360 --> 02:12:41.760]  George Zimmerman was being racist and that's why they let the new back Panther
[02:12:41.760 --> 02:12:47.920]  Party call for violence because it's all an attempt to start a race war this is
[02:12:47.920 --> 02:12:55.000]  absolutely what's going on 110% and Kurt Nemo has an article on it with the
[02:12:55.000 --> 02:12:58.960]  unedited video and audio where they're calling for killing Whitey and you know
[02:12:58.960 --> 02:13:03.720]  the red sea of blood and start killing Whitey and and the new black Panther
[02:13:03.720 --> 02:13:10.120]  leader is saying get get get guns get gas masks get food well why so we can all
[02:13:10.120 --> 02:13:14.240]  be in bunkers killing each other all the bankers laugh at everybody this is so
[02:13:14.240 --> 02:13:18.960]  stupid this is so stupid I've said it over and over again they want to get a
[02:13:18.960 --> 02:13:22.960]  war between the American people and the police and the military going how many
[02:13:22.960 --> 02:13:28.000]  times have I said let's not show up let's not have it that's how desperate the
[02:13:28.000 --> 02:13:32.960]  globalist are going under this worldwide depression wars and now it's well
[02:13:32.960 --> 02:13:35.920]  let's just get the blacks and whites killing each other and they want to get
[02:13:35.920 --> 02:13:39.960]  the whites and Hispanics killing each other I mean it is so and then the
[02:13:39.960 --> 02:13:45.840]  government's going to play the part of coming in and restoring order I mean
[02:13:45.840 --> 02:13:52.320]  this is cut and dry MSNBC is engaged in sedition trying to hype blacks to
[02:13:52.320 --> 02:13:55.680]  riot in this country because they don't want blacks and whites being friendly
[02:13:55.680 --> 02:13:59.880]  with each other and all that'll make is whites that aren't racist most white
[02:13:59.880 --> 02:14:04.680]  people I know are not racist of black people in fact they're into black films
[02:14:04.680 --> 02:14:09.760]  football stars music they're scared of black people let me explain the
[02:14:09.760 --> 02:14:17.200]  difference whites I know on average are not racist in any way but they are
[02:14:17.200 --> 02:14:21.560]  scared and black people I know aren't comfortable in a lot of cases around
[02:14:21.560 --> 02:14:28.480]  white people you see how that works and so now they want to make a poster child
[02:14:28.480 --> 02:14:31.600]  for all this the new black Panther Party because the black Panthers actually
[02:14:31.600 --> 02:14:34.840]  did some good early on trying to tell blacks get armed defend yourselves
[02:14:34.840 --> 02:14:38.720]  don't be slaves stand up for yourself I'm all about being empowered the new
[02:14:38.720 --> 02:14:43.040]  black Panther Party is a government scythe and I'll bet you a million dollars
[02:14:43.040 --> 02:14:46.760]  and I said this about Hal Turner for 10 years the white supremacist leader I
[02:14:46.760 --> 02:14:50.400]  said that guy's a fed he wouldn't be allowed to say that if he won one and
[02:14:50.400 --> 02:14:54.480]  you know what it turned out he was a fed he admitted it himself setting people
[02:14:54.480 --> 02:14:59.480]  up these black Panther leaders are feds or they are the dumbest useful idiots
[02:14:59.480 --> 02:15:04.320]  I've ever seen and they don't sound dumb they're feds they're feds just like MSNBC
[02:15:04.320 --> 02:15:10.760]  has run out of the White House on record and edit tapes makes me so sick and then
[02:15:10.760 --> 02:15:13.640]  Obama can sit back and act like he's not part of all this racial stuff and
[02:15:13.640 --> 02:15:18.320]  let's come together come on now while his surrogates are out there stirring this
[02:15:18.320 --> 02:15:27.880]  up and I for one have had enough of it so I mean let's just say 10,000 black
[02:15:27.880 --> 02:15:31.120]  people wanted to invade the small town I live in and come kill the whites it
[02:15:31.120 --> 02:15:40.480]  would be it is so crazy and so ridiculous okay white people are in the
[02:15:40.480 --> 02:15:45.200]  countryside dug in and they're almost all former military I'm just gonna leave
[02:15:45.200 --> 02:15:52.800]  it at that okay dug in dug in I mean we had friends here in town I'm not gonna
[02:15:52.800 --> 02:15:56.640]  get into it the point is you go around looking at houses and stuff like a
[02:15:56.640 --> 02:16:01.200]  third of them are bunkers look normal on the outside bunkers on the inside I
[02:16:01.200 --> 02:16:07.200]  mean almost everybody I know has 50 calibers and seven you know mag
[02:16:07.200 --> 02:16:16.000]  Lapuas and know how to shoot a fly off a fence post at 200 yards and I've told
[02:16:16.000 --> 02:16:19.560]  the police and military don't blow up a bunch of stuff or have your bosses do
[02:16:19.560 --> 02:16:22.600]  it then try to march against the American people and of course the
[02:16:22.600 --> 02:16:25.440]  military is awakened they know this and then they understand the police are
[02:16:25.440 --> 02:16:30.840]  waking up I had an alarm go off this weekend it's malfunctioning or
[02:16:30.840 --> 02:16:33.320]  something I think I lived in another house this happened where squirrels
[02:16:33.320 --> 02:16:37.000]  had eaten the cords I don't know what's doing it but it says a door alarm goes
[02:16:37.000 --> 02:16:40.920]  off once I was out of town it happened and nobody broke in the other night it's
[02:16:40.920 --> 02:16:45.240]  in the middle of the night and the alarm goes off and the alarm company calls and
[02:16:45.240 --> 02:16:49.120]  says what's the code word and I said it to them they said spell it and I said I
[02:16:49.120 --> 02:16:52.400]  don't know how to spell it and read on this I was nice but I said come on I'm
[02:16:52.400 --> 02:16:59.840]  Alex Jones well on they said okay thank you 20 minutes later there there are
[02:16:59.840 --> 02:17:04.080]  lights and police out there walking around so I'd go outside go up to the
[02:17:04.080 --> 02:17:10.200]  gate and they were real nice and I said who I was and when I'm looked at me and
[02:17:10.200 --> 02:17:12.760]  said okay let's get out of here but the female cop because let me see your
[02:17:12.760 --> 02:17:17.480]  driver's license and and the guy obviously knew who I was but he just
[02:17:17.480 --> 02:17:21.280]  wasn't gonna second-guess her and I had my jeans on my shirt off at my wallet
[02:17:21.280 --> 02:17:25.840]  and I showed her and she goes Alexander and Rick Jones mm-hmm and I looked at
[02:17:25.840 --> 02:17:30.000]  I was like you know who I am sure you know who I am and you just asked for that
[02:17:30.000 --> 02:17:33.720]  but they were overall friendly and I got an alarm so I'm asking for police at my
[02:17:33.720 --> 02:17:38.360]  house side issuer John are you still there I'm ranting I mean how does that
[02:17:38.360 --> 02:17:43.640]  add to your story there's nothing I was gonna say Alex is they got a new stock
[02:17:43.640 --> 02:17:48.640]  out called the slide fire that you put on a AR-15 or an AK-47 and increases the
[02:17:48.640 --> 02:17:52.920]  fire rate to 750 rounds a minute and right now they've been selling like
[02:17:52.920 --> 02:17:55.760]  hotcakes they sold like they've been on sale for about less than a year and they
[02:17:55.760 --> 02:18:01.560]  sold like 200,000 and they're still what is it again it's a new stock called the
[02:18:01.560 --> 02:18:06.200]  slide fire you go to Google and type in slide fire and it increased you put on
[02:18:06.200 --> 02:18:12.120]  AR-15 or AK-47 and it increases the rate of fire to 750 rounds a minute on a
[02:18:12.120 --> 02:18:16.360]  semi-auto on a semi-auto just go to Google and type in but let me ask you a
[02:18:16.360 --> 02:18:21.680]  question when would you need to have I mean because I mean with a 30-round
[02:18:21.680 --> 02:18:27.280]  clip at semi-auto I can hit targets shooting about every half a second but
[02:18:27.280 --> 02:18:31.320]  I mean if it was full auto you just spray 30 rounds that I mean it isn't that
[02:18:31.320 --> 02:18:35.640]  only if people are pouring in through your door or down into your foxhole then
[02:18:35.640 --> 02:18:40.080]  you've got to go full auto and and do it do a spray I mean don't you want semi-auto
[02:18:40.080 --> 02:18:44.320]  to begin with I fought in Vietnam and when I got over there they told us they
[02:18:44.320 --> 02:18:47.280]  took us out to the range and they they let us fire full auto and then they let
[02:18:47.280 --> 02:18:52.120]  us fire semi just to prove that semi is more effective to be used in a combat
[02:18:52.120 --> 02:18:56.200]  situation and full auto even though full auto was always meant as an emergency
[02:18:56.200 --> 02:18:59.800]  switch it was never you want exactly exactly that's like when you're getting
[02:18:59.800 --> 02:19:05.160]  human wave attacks in Korea but but what I like is a is a hundred round drum on a
[02:19:05.160 --> 02:19:10.360]  Mack 90 AK-47 semi-auto variant I think overall in hundred yard type
[02:19:10.360 --> 02:19:13.960]  situations that's one of the best guns out there I mean obviously there's more
[02:19:13.960 --> 02:19:18.000]  high-powered stuff HK 91 you know things like that that are really great
[02:19:18.000 --> 02:19:22.560]  rifles because 308 packs a lot more punch but it's just man I tell you those
[02:19:22.560 --> 02:19:27.360]  AK-47s just have never I play on ten of them you know the semi-auto versions
[02:19:27.360 --> 02:19:30.840]  they've never given me a problem they're just magical firearms
[02:19:30.840 --> 02:19:37.560]  Google though and type in slide fire it'll have demonstrations of the gun yeah
[02:19:37.560 --> 02:19:42.680]  but I mean I mean I mean do you like the AK-47 yeah I got four of them and I got
[02:19:42.680 --> 02:19:46.560]  a couple AR-15s too and I got a slide fire stock too I just use that an
[02:19:46.560 --> 02:19:50.160]  emergency that's just an emergency use only you know I've just got AK-47s all
[02:19:50.160 --> 02:19:54.240]  over the place I mean you can't have enough of them all right but I'm scared
[02:19:54.240 --> 02:20:00.520]  of the black panthers don't get me we'll be right back stay with us
[02:20:00.520 --> 02:20:06.040]  a little over a year ago I began to do a lot of research into why even if I had a
[02:20:06.040 --> 02:20:09.760]  pretty good size meal that I was still starving and my research led me to a
[02:20:09.760 --> 02:20:13.800]  well-known fact that most of the soils that we grow our crops on here in the
[02:20:13.800 --> 02:20:17.200]  United States and across the industrialized world are almost completely
[02:20:17.200 --> 02:20:21.920]  depleted of almost all of the key minerals and trace elements that our
[02:20:21.920 --> 02:20:26.360]  bodies need to rebuild themselves fight off cancer and be healthy I then
[02:20:26.360 --> 02:20:31.120]  searched out the best vitamin and mineral company out there and discovered

[02:24:30.560 --> 02:24:35.280]  Americans have been ignorant to a certain extent and let our freedoms be
[02:24:35.280 --> 02:24:40.280]  taken because we had some any great things going on at so much prosperity we
[02:24:40.280 --> 02:24:44.960]  got drunk on prosperity and success whether you're black white aspanic
[02:24:44.960 --> 02:24:49.560]  asian old young everybody deep down knows things are not going the right
[02:24:49.560 --> 02:24:53.520]  direction and that the government is run by criminals and that we're in a
[02:24:53.520 --> 02:24:58.320]  depression and it's getting worse that the media is lying to us and that's why
[02:24:58.320 --> 02:25:03.120]  there's been a full-on armament campaign the last five years going on that has
[02:25:03.120 --> 02:25:07.680]  now doubled its previous records in fact I was wrong when I said five million
[02:25:07.680 --> 02:25:12.400]  guns are being sold a month it's more like seven million everyone is arming to
[02:25:12.400 --> 02:25:20.040]  the teeth and that's a good thing to a point but a bad thing because it's
[02:25:20.040 --> 02:25:25.840]  good people are armed that's great but the bad silver lining is the cruddy
[02:25:25.840 --> 02:25:29.320]  lining is that the system is going to use that to demonize the second
[02:25:29.320 --> 02:25:32.240]  amendment there's going to be some idiots who are gonna do some stupid
[02:25:32.240 --> 02:25:36.000]  things with guns and that's why I got my guns to defend myself from those
[02:25:36.000 --> 02:25:39.640]  stupid idiots so I'm a hundred percent for the second amendment I'm just
[02:25:39.640 --> 02:25:43.760]  talking about how they're going to use it to spin it and here are some of the
[02:25:43.760 --> 02:25:47.920]  reports count hall reports great news their beings are casting new black
[02:25:47.920 --> 02:25:54.200]  panthers called to create Red Sea of Bloodshed in a race war we've got that
[02:25:54.200 --> 02:25:57.240]  audio we're gonna start playing it now and come back from break with it the new
[02:25:57.240 --> 02:26:01.280]  black Panther Party wants a race war and they want it to start tomorrow that's
[02:26:01.280 --> 02:26:06.280]  today in an audio recording of a planned meeting for a Trayvon Martin rally
[02:26:06.280 --> 02:26:11.960]  new black Panther Party members have resorted to violent action to what they
[02:26:11.960 --> 02:26:18.160]  are calling revolution yeah that's a great idea I mean the police about all
[02:26:18.160 --> 02:26:22.040]  those armored vehicles and weapons are just waiting but you notice I bet the
[02:26:22.040 --> 02:26:27.000]  police are gonna pull back if they do something and let the burning begin
[02:26:27.000 --> 02:26:33.920]  because again it's got to get out of control we've got to suit up and boot up
[02:26:33.920 --> 02:26:37.720]  and get prepared for the war we're in I'm about to play this true revolution
[02:26:37.720 --> 02:26:45.840]  means some bloodshed some bloodshed huh what did that Muhammad guy say he's dead
[02:26:45.840 --> 02:26:50.640]  now of a brain aneurysm he'd say you kill the white women you kill the white
[02:26:50.640 --> 02:26:54.960]  babies and you kill the babies the little white devils and you kill the white
[02:26:54.960 --> 02:27:01.080]  woman because she's the military manufacturing center all this baloney I
[02:27:01.080 --> 02:27:08.200]  love doing an imitation though we're going to have to cause we're going to
[02:27:08.200 --> 02:27:12.480]  have to cause the Red Sea I'm talking about blonde-haired blue-eyed sometimes
[02:27:12.480 --> 02:27:18.160]  brown-eyed Caucasians walking around I am for violence and this is the kind of
[02:27:18.160 --> 02:27:23.560]  talk that will probably get some black people killed because there's already
[02:27:23.560 --> 02:27:27.760]  been a bunch of cases of whites being attacked and then this one guy his dad
[02:27:27.760 --> 02:27:31.640]  reportedly got killed by a black guy so now they went into reportedly in
[02:27:31.640 --> 02:27:35.720]  Oklahoma and shot a bunch of innocent black people oh this is just wonderful
[02:27:35.720 --> 02:27:44.160]  this is just going to be absolute no it's horrible it's horrible he goes I am
[02:27:44.160 --> 02:27:48.640]  for violence so he's saying kill blonde-haired blue-eyed people I am for
[02:27:48.640 --> 02:27:53.960]  violence be to see a red boom arrest him right there that is not free speech that
[02:27:53.960 --> 02:28:00.360]  is a call to action a call to violence if I got on air and said get guns or if
[02:28:00.360 --> 02:28:03.200]  you got on there and said get guns go out and find some black people and kill
[02:28:03.200 --> 02:28:07.200]  them we need blood I should be arrested if I said go out and do that if your
[02:28:07.200 --> 02:28:13.440]  neighbors said go out and kill white people go out and kill Hispanics go out
[02:28:13.440 --> 02:28:21.240]  in any group go out and kill Muslims any group I mean that is a call to kill
[02:28:21.240 --> 02:28:27.040]  people and you know what it's it's already happening it's already happening
[02:28:27.040 --> 02:28:35.720]  show there you go Obama starting a race war he goes on to say I am bleeped off
[02:28:35.720 --> 02:28:41.880]  right now because the state of Florida isn't on fire I'm reading the quotes
[02:28:41.880 --> 02:28:47.520]  we're gonna come back and play it we've got to starve capitalism really what
[02:28:47.520 --> 02:28:51.080]  about Banksterism we want the complete removal of capitalism this is a
[02:28:51.080 --> 02:28:59.000]  communist I had a black communist here a while back who thought because I didn't
[02:28:59.000 --> 02:29:02.440]  like these wars and torture and stuff that he goes no you're a you're a
[02:29:02.440 --> 02:29:06.760]  libertarian socialist and I said no I'm a constitutionalist libertarian who
[02:29:06.760 --> 02:29:10.160]  believes in the free market he goes no you're not and then we went out and had
[02:29:10.160 --> 02:29:13.200]  dinner and he had a few beers and he told me looked across and he said I'm
[02:29:13.200 --> 02:29:16.320]  not gonna air the air the interviews I did because I just don't want to get off
[02:29:16.320 --> 02:29:20.440]  and do it and he said there's got to be blood and more blood and blood's
[02:29:20.440 --> 02:29:26.520]  coming but with him it was with people with money and I'm just like on people
[02:29:26.520 --> 02:29:29.040]  with money once you kill all them there's not going to be anybody that
[02:29:29.040 --> 02:29:33.440]  actually organize I mean middle-class real money is what makes a wealthy
[02:29:33.440 --> 02:29:38.560]  country and and it's the big bankers that are funding this idea so we'll come
[02:29:38.560 --> 02:29:44.840]  back but new black Panther Party calling for burning US cities the police are
[02:29:44.840 --> 02:29:48.880]  doing nothing which it means they're aiding and abetting it the Florida
[02:29:48.880 --> 02:29:56.480]  police we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio
[02:29:56.480 --> 02:30:05.640]  network a little over a year ago I began to do a lot of research into why even
[02:30:05.640 --> 02:30:09.200]  if I had a pretty good-sized meal that I was still starving and my research led
[02:30:09.200 --> 02:30:13.720]  me to a well-known fact that most of the soils that we grow our crops on here in
[02:30:13.720 --> 02:30:17.160]  the United States and across the industrialized world are almost completely
[02:30:17.160 --> 02:30:21.960]  depleted of almost all of the key minerals and trace elements that our
[02:30:21.960 --> 02:30:26.480]  bodies need to rebuild themselves fight off cancer and be healthy I then

[02:32:03.760 --> 02:32:08.080]  solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily double
[02:32:08.080 --> 02:32:12.280]  or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control
[02:32:12.280 --> 02:32:16.280]  how much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total
[02:32:16.280 --> 02:32:20.160]  government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is
[02:32:20.160 --> 02:32:24.440]  coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously
[02:32:24.440 --> 02:32:28.600]  overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the
[02:32:28.600 --> 02:32:32.920]  problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every
[02:32:32.920 --> 02:32:36.120]  year thousands of families lose their power from weather related onages
[02:32:36.120 --> 02:32:40.480]  number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and
[02:32:40.480 --> 02:32:43.800]  peace of mind folks I really believe in the solar power generators offered by
[02:32:43.800 --> 02:32:47.200]  solutions from science one of my oldest sponsors you can get more information

[02:33:08.720 --> 02:33:32.200]  live from Austin Texas broadcasting world-wide it's Alex Jones
[02:33:32.200 --> 02:33:35.680]  all right I'll continue with your calls it's rather important news here on this
[02:33:35.680 --> 02:33:42.360]  live Monday edition but again it's one thing to know Obama and his controllers
[02:33:42.360 --> 02:33:46.920]  Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase, are trying to get the American people at
[02:33:46.920 --> 02:33:49.080]  each other's throats that were in a depression they're starting all these
[02:33:49.080 --> 02:33:53.560]  new wars and they did say they weren't gonna attack Iran now they flip-flopped
[02:33:53.560 --> 02:34:02.160]  and say they probably will I mean just craziness but it's it's just amazing to
[02:34:02.160 --> 02:34:07.720]  actually see MSNBC and NBC editing tapes to make Zimmerman sound like he hates
[02:34:07.720 --> 02:34:12.680]  black people and and the media hyping this trying to get a race war going and
[02:34:12.680 --> 02:34:16.880]  then these feds these different new black Panther Party leaders in its
[02:34:16.880 --> 02:34:22.600]  speeches saying I'm mad that Florida isn't on fire and I want some white
[02:34:22.600 --> 02:34:30.200]  blood dripping we need to kill some white people and the Justice Department is
[02:34:30.200 --> 02:34:36.640]  down there investigating George Zimmerman and Al Sharpton saying do you want
[02:34:36.640 --> 02:34:43.800]  violence and then I get these weird comments on the YouTube and the site
[02:34:43.800 --> 02:34:48.160]  going oh Alex the Whitey is scared saying we should come together you're
[02:34:48.160 --> 02:34:54.000]  gonna get it yeah I mean it's so mindless like I'm scared that you're gonna
[02:34:54.000 --> 02:34:59.200]  burn down your neighborhoods and make all the culture in society scared of you
[02:34:59.200 --> 02:35:07.200]  and nobody want to work with you I mean I am scared for our society like what
[02:35:07.200 --> 02:35:10.920]  Hal Turner was trying to get a race for going from the whites the premise angle
[02:35:10.920 --> 02:35:15.400]  working for the feds because if we ever get together and go after the New World
[02:35:15.400 --> 02:35:19.560]  Order we could actually you know get out of the grips of people that are putting
[02:35:19.560 --> 02:35:23.600]  GMO food on all the shelves whether you're black or white or Asian or
[02:35:23.600 --> 02:35:27.440]  whatever you call yourself Native American Indian whatever you call
[02:35:27.440 --> 02:35:30.800]  yourself this stuff's hurting you and your family and you know I just want to
[02:35:30.800 --> 02:35:38.480]  live in peace I just don't want to be an evil person so no the magic race war
[02:35:38.480 --> 02:35:44.800]  where the black people kill all the whites and we all live in you know our
[02:35:44.800 --> 02:35:50.880]  own separate areas after that that's not gonna happen the globalists do want to
[02:35:50.880 --> 02:35:54.800]  break off part of Southwest and make it kind of a socialist slash Hispanic
[02:35:54.800 --> 02:35:59.080]  kingdom you know where whites and others still live there but but that's the
[02:35:59.080 --> 02:36:03.680]  political bit attaching socialism to being Hispanic that the that's a big
[02:36:03.680 --> 02:36:07.480]  Ford Foundation plan and then that could actually work and of course be a
[02:36:07.480 --> 02:36:10.800]  nightmare for those living under it but whatever there'll be this racial pride
[02:36:10.800 --> 02:36:15.800]  of you know the larger Union but within it Enclave see the globalist merged
[02:36:15.800 --> 02:36:21.840]  countries into super states but then break up new regions within them to
[02:36:21.840 --> 02:36:28.680]  control everybody this is this is standard divide and conquer operations
[02:36:29.040 --> 02:36:38.440]  standard and it's just so silly that when somebody says hey let's just get
[02:36:38.440 --> 02:36:43.920]  along this is a tragedy but the media is hyping it that itself is a hoax let's
[02:36:43.920 --> 02:36:47.640]  talk about real issues and it's like I don't want to hear about black babies
[02:36:47.640 --> 02:36:54.760]  being aborted it's you racist whites we're gonna kill you because the media
[02:36:54.760 --> 02:37:00.800]  says be upset about Trayvon Martin you're upset about that but you can't get
[02:37:00.800 --> 02:37:05.720]  upset about all the other really serious stuff and that's my point why do we let
[02:37:05.720 --> 02:37:11.240]  the mainstream media who's trying ridiculously obviously I mean it's so
[02:37:11.240 --> 02:37:15.840]  obvious they're trying to get some cities burning and now they can't get
[02:37:15.840 --> 02:37:22.440]  their fed new black Panther party people can't get riots going so they're like
[02:37:22.440 --> 02:37:29.760]  I'm angry I want Florida in fire now start killing whitey now I am angry I
[02:37:29.760 --> 02:37:33.800]  always love how these guys that when everybody do violence I always have
[02:37:33.800 --> 02:37:37.640]  these provocateurs email me and comment and send me letters and go you're a
[02:37:37.640 --> 02:37:42.280]  coward Jones not calling for a military war with the police and military you're
[02:37:42.280 --> 02:37:47.200]  a coward not saying March on DC with our guns and of course if those people
[02:37:47.200 --> 02:37:52.960]  never March they never go out they want me to shoot my mouth off so they can
[02:37:52.960 --> 02:37:58.760]  arrest me but even if I could lead a armed revolution and quote get away
[02:37:58.760 --> 02:38:02.760]  with it it'd be incredibly dangerous because we probably end up some getting
[02:38:02.760 --> 02:38:07.120]  something worse out of it generally violent revolutions do that we need to
[02:38:07.120 --> 02:38:12.200]  have a revolution of ideas and start saying no to tyranny and non-compliance
[02:38:12.200 --> 02:38:16.120]  and then if they come to your house to burn it down like Waco you defend
[02:38:16.120 --> 02:38:22.080]  yourself you defensively and that means once they start a fight with you then
[02:38:22.080 --> 02:38:27.640]  you take the offense to them whoever's doing it but it they still started it so
[02:38:27.640 --> 02:38:33.080]  you're on the defense you understand that that's how that works but I'm not
[02:38:33.080 --> 02:38:37.520]  like I've seen enough violence been around enough know enough history that
[02:38:37.520 --> 02:38:43.520]  I'm not looking forward to once the real craziness starts and it probably will
[02:38:43.520 --> 02:38:47.320]  them in the New World Order's got big plans to break this country up they've
[02:38:47.320 --> 02:38:51.520]  always had those plans but it's not going to be and then these racial lines
[02:38:51.520 --> 02:38:57.160]  that people dream of it's going to be along economic and and and and political
[02:38:57.160 --> 02:39:03.840]  lines and that's the plan the end of America as we know it pretty much has
[02:39:03.840 --> 02:39:10.280]  already happened let's go ahead and go to the cuss words edited this is again
[02:39:10.280 --> 02:39:14.280]  warning strong language but but but we've bleeped it out it's up at info
[02:39:14.280 --> 02:39:19.680]  wars dot com right now here is the new black panther party at exchange of
[02:39:19.680 --> 02:39:24.680]  speeches and again another different names the people in all that are in the
[02:39:24.680 --> 02:39:28.640]  town hall meeting Kurt Nemo's got an article the black Panthers and Nazis
[02:39:28.640 --> 02:39:32.600]  hijacked Trayvon Martin case oh yeah they're involved as well I should have
[02:39:32.600 --> 02:39:37.840]  added that but again it's the leftist media angle from the left left right
[02:39:37.840 --> 02:39:41.360]  paradigms false but within the left right paradigm they're from a left
[02:39:41.360 --> 02:39:46.920]  perspective they're pushing with moral authority violence in the news media
[02:39:46.920 --> 02:39:54.560]  from a righteous anger perspective here's another one a new black Panthers
[02:39:54.560 --> 02:40:06.920]  booted suited an arm for coming race war and that's by Michelle Williams and
[02:40:06.920 --> 02:40:16.480]  Sean Kuali the chief of staff in Tampa a national spokesman respectively the
[02:40:16.480 --> 02:40:24.400]  call was filled with violence hate filled speech see notice how even bright
[02:40:24.400 --> 02:40:30.640]  Bart picks up this nomenclature of hate speech no no hate speeches when they
[02:40:30.640 --> 02:40:34.040]  say I hate the banksters in the new world order a bunch of criminals they say
[02:40:34.040 --> 02:40:38.840]  we should ban that hate speech so they create a word for free speech and then
[02:40:38.840 --> 02:40:42.680]  when people say kill people which is a call to action terroristic threat
[02:40:42.680 --> 02:40:47.480]  violence and racketeering organized crime they're trying to organize people to
[02:40:47.480 --> 02:40:53.920]  commit crime that's mafia that's organized racketeering they call it hate
[02:40:53.920 --> 02:40:58.040]  speech so now when they legally call me hate speech people like oh that's
[02:40:58.040 --> 02:41:02.920]  terrible you see so they they call people over these are radicals they're
[02:41:02.920 --> 02:41:07.960]  calling for murder and death no they're not radicals they're calling for
[02:41:07.960 --> 02:41:13.880]  terroristic acts see so they use a label that's too weak on these people
[02:41:13.880 --> 02:41:17.280]  because they because then that'll blur the lines of the label when they use it
[02:41:17.280 --> 02:41:21.280]  on people like Alex Jones saying I have hate speech because I say I hate the
[02:41:21.280 --> 02:41:27.880]  new world order no this isn't hate speech and stop using the political
[02:41:27.880 --> 02:41:32.880]  correctness commissariat language I got Glenn Beck here using it right Bart
[02:41:32.880 --> 02:41:40.200]  using it that is not what's going on they are calling for organized criminal
[02:41:40.200 --> 02:41:47.200]  violence and that's called if it's against a government that's clearly
[02:41:47.200 --> 02:41:50.960]  corrupt and evil it's called a resistance movement and the government's
[02:41:50.960 --> 02:41:55.160]  going to call it terrorism but when it's just against racial groups it's called
[02:41:55.160 --> 02:42:03.200]  genocidal intent a crime against humanity a terroristic threat a
[02:42:03.200 --> 02:42:09.400]  racketeering organized criminal activity this is racketeering that you are
[02:42:09.400 --> 02:42:14.080]  about to hear and the FBI probably runs this group that's why they're not going
[02:42:14.080 --> 02:42:17.880]  to stop them and the local police are going to do what the FBI tells them the
[02:42:17.880 --> 02:42:24.600]  people that said this stuff should be arrested if I said this because I'm not
[02:42:24.600 --> 02:42:30.680]  a fed I would be arrested so fast it make your head spin let's go ahead go to
[02:42:30.680 --> 02:42:54.160]  the tape here it is
[02:43:00.680 --> 02:43:14.440]  I mean this guy is such a cowardly fed and so is she and if they're not they're
[02:43:14.440 --> 02:43:19.280]  idiots protected by feds but I'm 99% their feds and they know they got
[02:43:19.280 --> 02:43:23.880]  White House backing and everything do these idiots have if those two morons
[02:43:23.880 --> 02:43:27.760]  tried to actually lead an assault on anybody all they're going to end up in
[02:43:27.760 --> 02:43:35.760]  is body bags I mean what a joke get ready for the race war to kill the
[02:43:35.760 --> 02:43:45.280]  honkeys any white supremacists that get away with talking like that are feds as
[02:43:45.280 --> 02:43:48.760]  well the Atari because they weren't white supremacists and we're just
[02:43:48.760 --> 02:43:52.960]  preparing to defend themselves were arrested for saying a day may come or
[02:43:52.960 --> 02:43:57.880]  we have to defend ourselves from the government that's totally constitutionally
[02:43:57.880 --> 02:44:01.360]  protected and the judge just dropped the case feds are still holding it was a
[02:44:01.360 --> 02:44:08.040]  bunch of criminals at that level go back to the tape this is just so amazing
[02:44:08.040 --> 02:44:16.480]  please continue and get prepared for the one that we're in for this stuff got to
[02:44:16.480 --> 02:44:21.400]  boil over and all your greats talked about that having to be bloodshed and
[02:44:21.400 --> 02:44:26.400]  born with revolution true revolution means some bloodshed so there's blood
[02:44:26.400 --> 02:44:31.120]  being spilled because there's a new life that is beyond this bloodshed there's a
[02:44:31.120 --> 02:44:35.480]  new reality that is built upon your original African principles and
[02:44:35.480 --> 02:44:40.640]  spiritualities and values and norms that is beyond this bloodshed but we got to
[02:44:40.640 --> 02:44:44.480]  go through it and as the scripture say you got a crossing we're gonna have to
[02:44:44.480 --> 02:44:51.440]  cross the red sea you're gonna have to cross the red sea I know y'all thought
[02:44:51.440 --> 02:44:54.720]  it was talking about all right look I want to play this without stopping it
[02:44:54.720 --> 02:44:59.160]  okay because this is unedited except for the cuss words bleeped out but again
[02:44:59.160 --> 02:45:02.960]  every group from the Nazis to the communists to some of the extreme
[02:45:02.960 --> 02:45:07.440]  Zionists every one of these groups says they're the supreme group all culture
[02:45:07.440 --> 02:45:14.200]  comes from them and that everybody else mechela Raza says this every other
[02:45:14.200 --> 02:45:17.880]  group is trash and all culture came from their group and they don't like
[02:45:17.880 --> 02:45:24.640]  violence but they've got to do it every racial supremacy group does this and the
[02:45:24.640 --> 02:45:27.960]  globalists just love it they just sit back and play us off against each other
[02:45:27.960 --> 02:45:31.720]  and again who's trying to help with the race we're going MSNBC in the White
[02:45:31.720 --> 02:45:36.480]  House this is divide and conquer I'm gonna play it unedited them we're going to
[02:45:36.480 --> 02:45:48.800]  break here it is
[02:46:06.480 --> 02:46:14.600]  yeah but what she said was right we got to suit up the Buddha we got to suit up
[02:46:14.600 --> 02:46:20.880]  and Buddha and get prepared for the war that we're in so this stuff got to boil
[02:46:20.880 --> 02:46:26.120]  over and all your greats talked about that having to be bloodshed in bond
[02:46:26.120 --> 02:46:30.960]  with revolution true revolution means some bloodshed so there's blood being
[02:46:30.960 --> 02:46:35.480]  still because there's a new life that is beyond this bloodshed there's a new
[02:46:35.480 --> 02:46:39.560]  reality that is built upon your original African principles and
[02:46:39.560 --> 02:46:44.400]  spiritual outties and values and norms that is beyond this bloodshed but we
[02:46:44.400 --> 02:46:48.320]  got to go through it and as description say you got a crossing we're gonna have
[02:46:48.320 --> 02:46:55.560]  to cross the Red Sea you're gonna have to cross the Red Sea I know y'all thought
[02:46:55.560 --> 02:46:59.400]  it was talking about some sea and some Middle Eastern part of the world hell
[02:46:59.400 --> 02:47:05.160]  no we're talking about some blood you're gonna have to cross some good and go
[02:47:05.160 --> 02:47:09.400]  through some blood and some battles and there they are those who wish they could
[02:47:09.400 --> 02:47:14.120]  stand in this hour to see the destruction of the devil's world of the
[02:47:14.120 --> 02:47:17.640]  devil's society and I ain't talking about no dude underneath the ground with a
[02:47:17.640 --> 02:47:22.920]  pitchfork and pantyhose I'm talking about that blond head blue eyes sometime
[02:47:22.920 --> 02:47:28.040]  brown-eyed Caucasian walking around with a mindset of demonic mindset and the
[02:47:28.040 --> 02:47:34.440]  nature to do evil and brutality I say to everyone that is on this call right now
[02:47:34.440 --> 02:47:41.040]  I'm coming out of the gate like that gray howl on that rabbit and his prize my
[02:47:41.040 --> 02:47:47.280]  prize right now this evening is gonna be the bounty the arrest did alive for
[02:47:47.280 --> 02:47:53.720]  George Zimmerman you feel me to every brother to every female I am for violence
[02:47:53.720 --> 02:47:59.000]  if non-violence means we continue to postpone a solution to the American
[02:47:59.000 --> 02:48:03.600]  black man's problem just to avoid violence head pause I can't help it back
[02:48:03.600 --> 02:48:09.640]  it up 10 seconds so they hear it unedited arrest her right now arrest her
[02:48:09.640 --> 02:48:14.960]  she just called for violence she said dead or alive go get him and it goes on
[02:48:14.960 --> 02:48:20.480]  and on but they're fed run so they won't get in trouble this government is so
[02:48:20.480 --> 02:48:24.160]  sick and that's why you'll never get our guns that they the system would love to
[02:48:24.160 --> 02:48:27.680]  take our guns like they do in Africa and then play groups off against each other
[02:48:27.680 --> 02:48:33.160]  and there they'll do muslim versus christian I mean it's so sick and they've
[02:48:33.160 --> 02:48:37.080]  got their white supremacist counterparts fed run but they're not allowed to say it
[02:48:37.080 --> 02:48:40.520]  that much because it's a little too obvious but they're all working on the
[02:48:40.520 --> 02:48:49.000]  same team let's go back to the clip here it is right now this evening it's
[02:48:49.000 --> 02:48:55.960]  gonna be the bounty the arrest did alive for George Zimmerman you feel me to
[02:48:55.960 --> 02:49:01.960]  every brother to every female I am for violence if non-violence means we
[02:49:01.960 --> 02:49:06.920]  continue postponing a solution to the American black man's problem just to
[02:49:06.920 --> 02:49:14.120]  avoid violence you feel me it's time to wake up I don't know how else it's in me
[02:49:14.120 --> 02:49:19.480]  to fight it's in me to raise up soldiers it's in me that every time my feet
[02:49:19.480 --> 02:49:23.800]  touched the ground the state of Florida these crimes they scared that I'm
[02:49:23.800 --> 02:49:27.120]  carrying right now I'm kind of pissed off right now that the state of Florida ain't
[02:49:27.120 --> 02:49:31.920]  on fire this could not have happened in LA because some brothers up there are not
[02:49:31.920 --> 02:49:36.400]  scared to riot this could not have happened in St. Petersburg, Florida where
[02:49:36.400 --> 02:49:41.280]  the black man over there ain't scared to kill a cracker this is real we're
[02:49:41.280 --> 02:49:44.440]  attacked anyway in the world we were defending ourselves by any means
[02:49:44.440 --> 02:49:49.920]  necessary we have proposed and we're pushing forward with a national strike
[02:49:49.920 --> 02:49:54.400]  and walk out on this cracker and on this decent on these bastards we are
[02:49:54.400 --> 02:49:58.080]  proposing and pushing for our people that you hit them in the pocket where it
[02:49:58.080 --> 02:50:04.160]  hurts you starve capitalism since this racism that's being perpetuated and
[02:50:04.160 --> 02:50:07.840]  this brutality that's being perpetuated and this murder that's being
[02:50:07.840 --> 02:50:13.240]  perpetuated is built on the table legs of capitalism you got to starve
[02:50:13.240 --> 02:50:19.440]  capitalism what you saying is real and an act of war has been declared on as
[02:50:19.440 --> 02:50:24.640]  we don't have no choice but to fight but I want to say that we have to be trained
[02:50:24.640 --> 02:50:28.440]  how to fight see the whole purpose of the maneuvers that's happening in
[02:50:28.440 --> 02:50:33.280]  Sanford is to train in self-defense because many of us think we're prepared
[02:50:33.280 --> 02:50:37.200]  for a battle just like many of us think we're prepared for a fight but if you
[02:50:37.200 --> 02:50:41.800]  are not training if you're not stocking up water if you're not stocking up food
[02:50:41.800 --> 02:50:46.520]  if you're not stocking up weapons and artillery and survival books and gas
[02:50:46.520 --> 02:50:52.920]  mass and flashlights and canteens and ready to eat meals and all that
[02:50:52.920 --> 02:50:57.000]  if you're not stocking it up I'll come back with the rest of it we'll be right
[02:50:57.000 --> 02:51:00.120]  back after this break see the end part's actually good everybody should be

[02:54:08.080 --> 02:54:14.720]  one that might be this is not a new world it is simply an extension of what
[02:54:14.720 --> 02:54:19.440]  began in the old one it is patterned itself after every dictator who was ever
[02:54:19.440 --> 02:54:23.720]  planted the ripping imprint of a boot on the pages of history since the beginning
[02:54:23.720 --> 02:54:28.560]  of time it has refinements technological advances and a more
[02:54:28.560 --> 02:54:33.560]  sophisticated approach to the destruction of human freedom but like
[02:54:33.560 --> 02:54:39.360]  every one of the super states that preceded it it has one iron rule logic
[02:54:39.360 --> 02:54:56.680]  is an enemy and truth is a menace the answer answer to 1984 is 1776 you're
[02:54:56.680 --> 02:55:10.720]  listening to the Alex John show I want to lay some truth on you here there are
[02:55:10.720 --> 02:55:16.360]  organized racial criminal groups of every religion race region of the world
[02:55:16.360 --> 02:55:20.320]  and they all get away with it because they say we do the bad things we do
[02:55:20.320 --> 02:55:25.800]  because that other groups gonna get us if we don't but by and large those very
[02:55:25.800 --> 02:55:30.760]  groups controlling their minions are more abusive to their minions than even
[02:55:30.760 --> 02:55:34.920]  the outside group is but people put up with it because they see it as the group
[02:55:34.920 --> 02:55:40.440]  doing it to them and that's why yeah there's corruption in different countries
[02:55:40.440 --> 02:55:43.760]  and problems but when the but when the globalists say oh attack this country
[02:55:43.760 --> 02:55:46.920]  they're evil they're not trying to attack them to bring liberty or freedom to
[02:55:46.920 --> 02:55:50.600]  those countries they're trying to attack them so they can basically just steal
[02:55:50.600 --> 02:55:57.040]  their resources and when you look at this type of
[02:55:57.040 --> 02:56:02.440]  Balkanization happening here in the US here is MSNBC editing tapes here's the
[02:56:02.440 --> 02:56:07.120]  White House pushing this here's every news channel trying to get a race war
[02:56:07.120 --> 02:56:12.920]  going and you've got the new Black Panther Party saying things that anybody
[02:56:12.920 --> 02:56:17.600]  else would be arrested and saying get out there and kill some crackers just
[02:56:17.600 --> 02:56:21.680]  start killing some white people kill some blonde-haired blue-eyed people kill
[02:56:21.680 --> 02:56:26.160]  them and that the end they say and by the way get prepared that's a script
[02:56:26.160 --> 02:56:29.440]  been written for them so they can then demonize people getting prepared and
[02:56:29.440 --> 02:56:34.720]  then it's yeah these crackers are scared when our feet touch the ground well
[02:56:34.720 --> 02:56:38.240]  yeah I mean it may scare little old ladies and stuff and I imagine people
[02:56:38.240 --> 02:56:44.760]  are gonna see this all over the news and they're gonna be scared now of the poor
[02:56:44.760 --> 02:56:50.400]  black guy that comes to their house to install dish network or something or the
[02:56:50.400 --> 02:56:53.720]  poor black plumber that comes their house is a Christian and got a bunch of
[02:56:53.720 --> 02:56:57.040]  kids at home they're trying to take care of keep out of trouble and it's gonna
[02:56:57.040 --> 02:56:59.960]  make black people not trust the white guy that comes their house I'm just so
[02:56:59.960 --> 02:57:07.000]  sick of it all I am so sick of cowardly scum white supremacist black
