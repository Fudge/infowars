[00:00.000 --> 00:16.680]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want to stop tyranny well
[00:16.680 --> 00:25.680]  so does he live from the info wars.com studios it's Alex Jones thanks to you
[00:25.680 --> 00:30.960]  kids we now know the virus is a hoax they included flu pneumonia and other
[00:30.960 --> 00:34.600]  infections to boost the numbers let's find out who is really behind it all
[00:34.600 --> 00:39.800]  like President Trump is definitely behind one of these fan-ups
[00:40.800 --> 00:47.720]  she's pink Dr. Fauci like I thought doctors were supposed to help people not
[00:47.720 --> 00:54.360]  scare them Microsoft's Bill Gates not only a computer guy he's a notorious
[00:54.360 --> 00:59.280]  vaccine pusher who wants to reduce the world's population I get it so Bill
[00:59.280 --> 01:02.880]  Gates wanted to vaccinate everyone after Fauci convinced them there was a
[01:02.880 --> 01:07.040]  deadly disease outbreak that's diabolical yeah that sounds pretty bad
[01:07.040 --> 01:11.480]  don't worry kids these globalists won't get away with their pandemic hoax this
[01:11.480 --> 01:15.560]  time where they're going they'll be locked up for a long good while in the
[01:15.560 --> 01:29.480]  big house hello useless eaters as you're unqualified not elected global human
[01:29.480 --> 01:33.280]  health overlord I'd like to take this opportunity to flaunt my position of
[01:33.280 --> 01:37.680]  power and influence over society and share some of my plans for you and
[01:37.680 --> 01:42.760]  your future when I am asked my fortune in computer software I demonstrated that
[01:42.760 --> 01:47.680]  I was willing to lie steal code cheat my partners and exercise monopolistic
[01:47.680 --> 01:52.640]  control to destroy my competitors now that I've retired I can rebrand myself
[01:52.640 --> 01:58.120]  as a humanitarian with my for-profit Foundation mass grading as a charity I
[01:58.120 --> 02:03.200]  can advocate for population reduction and sponsor mass humid experiments with
[02:03.200 --> 02:08.680]  unproven vaccines in vulnerable populations like my father a powerful
[02:08.680 --> 02:13.120]  banker eugenicists and Rockefeller crony himself it's always been my
[02:13.120 --> 02:17.240]  ambition to decide who lives and more importantly how many have to die
[02:17.240 --> 02:22.000]  whether it's under the guise of climate change or world health it's really all
[02:22.000 --> 02:28.120]  about controlling and culling the human herd for fun and profit in November of
[02:28.120 --> 02:35.000]  last year I hosted event 201 a wargame simulation of a global pandemic leaders
[02:35.000 --> 02:39.720]  from private corporations global banks governments and the media got together
[02:39.720 --> 02:44.480]  to strategize ways they could align and lock step when responding to a
[02:44.480 --> 02:49.840]  worldwide health crisis using a coordinated campaign of fear mongering
[02:49.840 --> 02:55.240]  intimidation social shaming and economic blackmail we realize that we could get
[02:55.240 --> 03:00.200]  around dangerous philosophies like individual liberty and national sovereignty
[03:00.200 --> 03:05.080]  with an obedient population we would be free to implement our own top-down
[03:05.080 --> 03:10.480]  solutions like forced quarantines social distancing contact tracing and
[03:10.480 --> 03:16.280]  mandatory testing as a means to seize technocratic control of society now
[03:16.280 --> 03:21.080]  imagine my excitement when we had the opportunity to release declare our own
[03:21.080 --> 03:26.080]  global pandemic it was my chance to look like the nostradamus of public health
[03:26.080 --> 03:31.320]  and to position myself in business partners like dr. Fauci as the de facto
[03:31.320 --> 03:37.120]  authorities on response and solutions through exaggerated doomsday scenarios
[03:37.120 --> 03:42.040]  and computer simulations our petty control freaks instituted harsh rules
[03:42.040 --> 03:48.440]  and draconian lockdowns even after our dire predictions prove false scared and
[03:48.440 --> 03:53.400]  well-meaning people continue to submit to the arbitrary and foolish demands of
[03:53.400 --> 03:58.600]  their so-called leaders having achieved global lockdown and medical martial law
[03:58.600 --> 04:04.000]  we will continue to hold hostage your ability to congregate work travel or do
[04:04.000 --> 04:08.840]  just about anything until we're prepared to roll out our bigger plan I'd like to
[04:08.840 --> 04:14.400]  call this pandemic one because believe me we have others in the works our final
[04:14.400 --> 04:19.200]  solution is to have you begging for us to vaccinate tag and digitally track
[04:19.200 --> 04:23.960]  each one of you like livestock not only will my foundation enjoy legal
[04:23.960 --> 04:29.040]  immunity and trillions in profits but these mandatory experimental vaccines
[04:29.040 --> 04:33.400]  will move us so much further down the road to absolute centralized global
[04:33.400 --> 04:38.080]  control if only my good friend Jeffrey Epstein had been here to celebrate with
[04:38.080 --> 04:44.040]  me aboard the Lolita Express so remember global citizens this will end when I say
[04:44.040 --> 04:50.320]  it ends could be a year maybe two years maybe never I guarantee that if we have
[04:50.320 --> 04:54.840]  our way it will be at least until you're not able to do anything to stop it just
[04:54.840 --> 05:00.160]  surrender your personal freedom and blisters asking all the time why do you
[05:00.160 --> 05:04.880]  have multiple multivitamins why do you have multiple high-quality iodine why
[05:04.880 --> 05:08.960]  do you do that because different strokes for different folks if we're talking to
[05:08.960 --> 05:12.920]  researchers and scientists and they say hey a lot of people love deep earth pure
[05:12.920 --> 05:16.560]  crystal iodine but you should put one out with deeper crystal iodine and the
[05:16.560 --> 05:20.640]  two other types because some people can't absorb pure iodine boom we did it
[05:20.640 --> 05:24.280]  it's popular at sex three is it better the next two you decide it's different
[05:24.280 --> 05:27.880]  strokes different folks well now we have a compliment to knock out our very
[05:27.880 --> 05:33.880]  popular powdered pill sleeping and that is down and out it's super strong way
[05:33.880 --> 05:37.560]  stronger than knocked out but they don't compete with each other different

[05:54.760 --> 06:11.320]  crashing through the lies and disinformation it's Alex Jones coming to
[06:11.320 --> 06:26.000]  you live from the front lines of the info war the word of warning to you my fellow Americans the second dose of the
[06:26.000 --> 06:32.040]  COVID-19 vaccine is no joke I had the COVID booster in the Moderna about four
[06:32.040 --> 06:37.800]  or five days ago and I'm still feeling wild side effects from it it made me feel
[06:37.800 --> 06:42.640]  worse than I felt in a long time like I had the worst flu in the world extreme
[06:42.640 --> 06:48.000]  shortness of breath I just felt so bad and dizziness fatigue shaking chills
[06:48.000 --> 06:54.280]  fever extremely irrational thinking aches headaches and it has just been
[06:54.280 --> 07:00.000]  devastating just felt miserable I recently took the COVID-19 vaccination
[07:00.000 --> 07:08.120]  after the shot I felt fine but within three days I went to the doctor because
[07:08.120 --> 07:16.520]  I had problems with my face the whole left side of my face actually I have
[07:16.520 --> 07:21.480]  bell palsy now Cassidy got the second Moderna shot on a Monday by Thursday
[07:21.480 --> 07:27.240]  morning they were in the ER she got sick right away the death of his youngest
[07:27.240 --> 07:31.920]  daughter Cassidy came out of nowhere four days after her second dose of the
[07:31.920 --> 07:36.920]  COVID-19 vaccine everybody from her work had kind of had flu like symptoms just
[07:36.920 --> 07:40.320]  like the nurse was telling us earlier today when we got tested she experienced
[07:40.320 --> 07:44.440]  she said all her friends did too yep all her friends did there's a report from
[07:44.440 --> 07:48.360]  the New York Times that there's been a severe allergic reaction from a health
[07:48.360 --> 07:53.240]  care worker in Alaska after receiving the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine Patriot doctor
[07:53.240 --> 07:57.280]  in Missouri works at nursing home and wants to comment on COVID vaccines yeah
[07:57.280 --> 08:03.280]  hi Alex so I'm a jury I'm a family medicine trainer and I'm a jury
[08:03.280 --> 08:09.440]  nutrition I work in nursing homes I have had 21 patients that I've identified
[08:09.440 --> 08:14.480]  that have died within 48 hours of getting either the first or second vaccine
[08:14.480 --> 08:24.760]  AstraZeneca she was healthy happy active the greatest mom you ever saw in your
[08:24.760 --> 08:31.560]  life and then she was so sick that she was you know in less than probably 12
[08:31.560 --> 08:36.720]  hours she was intubated and on life support and then she passed when you
[08:36.720 --> 08:41.760]  get the spike protein antibody in your system it will permanently and
[08:41.760 --> 08:47.480]  irreversibly change your immune system when you inject this shot that has this
[08:47.480 --> 08:52.080]  polyethylene glycol on the coating on the outside of it that is what is
[08:52.080 --> 08:56.720]  leading to anaphylactic reactions shock and death I think we're going to see
[08:56.720 --> 09:02.520]  massive injuries and a lot more deaths start somewhere between four and 18
[09:02.520 --> 09:06.920]  months from now would you recommend to our audience that they get the vaccine
[09:06.920 --> 09:12.040]  then I would I would recommend it and I would recommend it to a lot of people
[09:12.040 --> 09:17.840]  that don't want to get it and a lot of those people voted for me frankly
[09:25.880 --> 09:31.480]  well president Trump is not a doctor and neither is Bill Gates I'm not gonna
[09:31.480 --> 09:36.480]  take his advice and he's welcome to opinions but we see massive numbers of
[09:36.480 --> 09:41.000]  top scientists, virologists, genetic engineers, medical doctors, nurses going
[09:41.000 --> 09:45.000]  public all over the world so many of them we can't play them all here on air
[09:45.000 --> 09:48.800]  during a live show but they're all posted every day new interviews new reports
[09:48.800 --> 09:53.480]  at band.video here's one iris doctor exposes great reset agenda behind
[09:53.480 --> 09:57.960]  covid hoax and powerful video it's up exclusively right now at europewars.com
[09:57.960 --> 10:02.400]  and infowars.com here's doctor Ann McCloskey from Northern Ireland
[10:02.400 --> 10:06.360]  across this island and across the world there are millions of people who are
[10:06.360 --> 10:10.280]  waken into the understanding that this current health crisis this so-called
[10:10.280 --> 10:15.000]  pandemic is a trojan horse which has been used to introduce a new era for
[10:15.000 --> 10:18.920]  humanity the great reset the fourth industrial revolution building back
[10:18.920 --> 10:22.440]  better whatever catchy chirpy name the bankers and billionaires are calling it
[10:22.440 --> 10:27.120]  it's not good for you and me for the ordinary people relationships between
[10:27.120 --> 10:31.440]  individuals families communities governments and nations will change
[10:31.440 --> 10:36.240]  fundamentally they're coming for you your family your job your savings your
[10:36.240 --> 10:41.440]  home your pension your culture your traditions your freedom your very way
[10:41.440 --> 10:48.600]  of life unless we unite to resist we do not consent this is not a conspiracy
[10:48.600 --> 10:53.000]  theory but the outworking of a scheme written by people who hate the human
[10:53.000 --> 10:59.440]  race agenda 21 has been implemented now and will come to pass unless we unite to
[10:59.440 --> 11:04.920]  resist we do not consent last year a seasonal respiratory virus of high
[11:04.920 --> 11:09.880]  infectivity but low pathogenicity passed across the world and sadly took with the
[11:09.880 --> 11:14.040]  people who are very old who are already very thick and most of whom were in the
[11:14.040 --> 11:18.680]  last months and years of their lives there were younger people who died may
[11:18.680 --> 11:23.360]  God have mercy on their souls and comfort their families and friends but in terms
[11:23.360 --> 11:28.680]  of the overall all-cause mortality there was nothing to see seasonal viruses do
[11:28.680 --> 11:33.120]  this every year they have done since time began and they will continue to do so
[11:33.120 --> 11:38.800]  no matter what humans do in 2020 no country in no country was there a
[11:38.800 --> 11:43.400]  significant increase in overall mortality compared to the past Ireland in this
[11:43.400 --> 11:48.240]  pandemic actually increased your population by a couple of percent if we
[11:48.240 --> 11:52.160]  take away the track and trace system calling for the first time in medical
[11:52.160 --> 11:56.800]  history a case someone who's perfectly well who's no symptoms and which is going
[11:56.800 --> 12:01.440]  to cost the UK government 37 billion pounds over two years I don't even know
[12:01.440 --> 12:05.360]  what 37 billion pounds looks like what it would what it would buy would it be two
[12:05.360 --> 12:08.800]  hospitals would it be five hospitals would it be a thousand nurses jobs I
[12:08.800 --> 12:14.200]  have no idea but these PCR tests measure nothing they are an illusion to
[12:14.200 --> 12:18.880]  create a crisis if we take away the fact that the WHO changed the rules
[12:18.880 --> 12:24.000]  changed the way in which we measure disease impact by saying that any death
[12:24.000 --> 12:29.080]  within 28 days of a positive PCR test was due to covert and even without a
[12:29.080 --> 12:32.520]  positive test if you had symptoms shortness of breath fever the things
[12:32.520 --> 12:37.880]  that people die from every day that was covert too if we take away the daily
[12:37.880 --> 12:43.720]  new hourly incessant misery porn and the legacy media dolefully recounting the
[12:43.720 --> 12:48.080]  figures and scrutinizing the anguish last hours of those who were taken and the
[12:48.080 --> 12:52.800]  po-face politicians with crocodile tears pretend to care if we take away the
[12:52.800 --> 12:56.640]  psychological abuse of populations across this planet using applied
[12:56.640 --> 13:00.560]  behavioural psychology designed to keep them in terror if we take away the
[13:00.560 --> 13:05.120]  signage the arrows the one-way systems walk don't walk the yellow notices on
[13:05.120 --> 13:10.680]  every flat surface the sanitization the masks all the paraphernalia of this
[13:10.680 --> 13:14.640]  neuro-linguistic program and mental abuse which tells us that we are the
[13:14.640 --> 13:18.600]  bio hazards we are a danger to our families and friends if we take all this
[13:18.600 --> 13:22.560]  away there is nothing to see the emperor has no clothes but of course there was
[13:22.560 --> 13:27.480]  something to see wasn't there viruses don't make laws governments do but what
[13:27.480 --> 13:32.640]  we did see what we saw was removal of our most basic and inalienable rights to
[13:32.640 --> 13:37.680]  work to earn to move to associate to kiss to hug to go to church to bury our
[13:37.680 --> 13:42.160]  dead with dignity to live our lives as we see fit we saw the removal of a right
[13:42.160 --> 13:47.320]  to speak to protest to object to this tyranny we saw censorship character
[13:47.320 --> 13:51.920]  assassination and banishment of scientists and professors who dared to
[13:51.920 --> 13:55.880]  offer an alternative narrative we saw our children and young people locked up
[13:55.880 --> 14:00.280]  denied their education the right to play outside to live their precious young
[14:00.280 --> 14:05.480]  lives however they and their parents of it we've seen millions of the poorest and
[14:05.480 --> 14:10.040]  most marginalized people in the planet pushed to starvation and death because
[14:10.040 --> 14:15.480]  of the economic fallout because poverty kills I've worked as a GP throughout this
[14:15.480 --> 14:19.600]  past year and I've not seen people gasping for breath from covert but
[14:19.600 --> 14:24.760]  people utterly abandoned by their health system people in despair from loneliness
[14:24.760 --> 14:29.040]  from isolation fear people haven't seen their families and loved ones for months
[14:29.040 --> 14:33.480]  and whose lives are infinitely poor as a result I've seen delayed cancer
[14:33.480 --> 14:38.520]  diagnosis people haven't treatments cancelled just well alright there's a
[14:38.520 --> 14:41.920]  few minutes left in her incredibly powerful presentation I think I don't
[14:41.920 --> 14:45.200]  need to tell you that you need to share this if you want to be free it's at
[14:45.200 --> 14:51.160]  europewars.com it's at band.video it's at newswars.com and I'm gonna get a
[14:51.160 --> 14:57.120]  version of it posted at infowars.com as well but this lady is amazing and
[14:57.120 --> 15:00.640]  everything she says is dead on in just like a seven minute clip there's a few
[15:00.640 --> 15:04.240]  minutes left of it and you can show that to somebody and say this is all of it in
[15:04.240 --> 15:08.360]  one nutshell perfectly set now why did they do it because their whole house of
[15:08.360 --> 15:12.360]  cards was coming down they've created thousands of trillions of fake dollars
[15:12.360 --> 15:18.080]  fake currencies and they need to bring in martial law and make us forget that it
[15:18.080 --> 15:21.600]  was their fractional reserve banking and scams and derivatives that caused this
[15:21.600 --> 15:26.440]  not us and the so-called cobu this is the beginning of the planetary collapse
[15:26.440 --> 15:30.360]  that only gets worse and they'll cover up each last huge crime with the new crime
[15:30.360 --> 15:35.000]  that's bigger this is an algorithmic takeover system I call it satanic logic
[15:35.000 --> 15:39.680]  and we're all awakening to it right now and this is a beautiful time because the
[15:39.680 --> 15:44.200]  globalists have bitten off way more than they can chew iris doctor exposes great

[18:05.760 --> 18:20.200]  world war three well according to the international union of scientists we're
[18:20.200 --> 18:25.120]  the closest we've ever been to it since the cubanism crisis in the early 1960s
[18:25.120 --> 18:31.920]  it's thursday march 18th 2021 I'm your host Alex Jones there's the headline of
[18:31.920 --> 18:38.400]  the live show world war three Putin pulls Russian ambassadors from DC in
[18:38.400 --> 18:42.920]  response to Biden threat and I'm gonna be playing the clip of him with Stefan
[18:42.920 --> 18:46.760]  awful is coming up next segment where he said he has a killer with no soul and
[18:46.760 --> 18:52.560]  that Russia will pay the price this is after Putin said he wants to work with
[18:52.560 --> 18:56.920]  Biden this is after he said that he doesn't want a civil war in America this
[18:56.920 --> 19:00.000]  is after he said there's no evidence we got involved in your election communist
[19:00.000 --> 19:10.800]  China did and the response of course from Joe Biden was the price he's going to
[19:10.800 --> 19:17.000]  pay you'll see shortly he's a killer I mean this is just unbelievable
[19:17.000 --> 19:22.640]  rhetoric this is a kind of crap we used to hear from Kim Jong-un and Kim Jong
[19:22.640 --> 19:27.160]  il this is the stuff that you see dictators throwing around or Baghdad
[19:27.160 --> 19:33.000]  Bob this is not the stuff you see from a US president ever no US president has
[19:33.000 --> 19:38.360]  ever talked like this to a nuclear power and this is just an insane
[19:38.360 --> 19:42.200]  escalation that video clip is coming up next segment you know I've got a lot of
[19:42.200 --> 19:46.400]  other really interesting news here it's all very fascinating but compared to the
[19:46.400 --> 19:49.280]  global is trying to start war with Russia at China's behest so they'll be
[19:49.280 --> 19:53.800]  the dominant power compared to the global roll out of these deadly gene
[19:53.800 --> 19:57.240]  therapies and the media trying to suppress that and all the censorship
[19:57.240 --> 20:00.880]  compared to the economic collapse being engineered right now to bring us under
[20:00.880 --> 20:07.040]  total globalist control everything else is window dressing I mean is it
[20:07.040 --> 20:10.560]  interesting that Dan Bongino at least on the Westwood one radio stations is
[20:10.560 --> 20:14.680]  going to take over for Rush Limbaugh yeah that's interesting I mean is it
[20:14.680 --> 20:19.040]  interesting that the man charged with the killing of eight people in Georgia
[20:19.040 --> 20:24.160]  massacre parlors was an in-sale pervert not a Trump supporter like the media
[20:24.160 --> 20:28.800]  saying yeah that's all important or we've got Biden telling illegals to surge
[20:28.800 --> 20:32.640]  the border if he's elected telling him to come here so they can smuggle more
[20:32.640 --> 20:36.520]  children in which is now happening yeah that's powerful video you got
[20:36.520 --> 20:41.560]  media outlets saying that they want to be able to have access to the migrant
[20:41.560 --> 20:44.840]  children and Biden's not even responding to him because the media went along with
[20:44.840 --> 20:49.000]  the censorship of everybody else and lost of access for everybody else now you
[20:49.000 --> 20:58.040]  will become what you try to turn us into toothless legless armless vassals of the
[20:58.040 --> 21:03.080]  globalist you have made yourselves obsolete as the fourth of state the
[21:03.080 --> 21:11.040]  media is now a lapdog dying dinosaur on its deathbed on its last last vapors of
[21:11.040 --> 21:16.080]  fuel and then that leads us to the other big story mainstream media was forced
[21:16.080 --> 21:20.120]  to report on federal judges and court hearings where it came out the Clintons
[21:20.120 --> 21:26.320]  were only to express that they were involved with underage girls and that
[21:26.320 --> 21:29.760]  got pulled out of mainstream media articles with no response they didn't
[21:29.760 --> 21:33.600]  say that they retracted it they just pulled it from the Daily Beast and radar
[21:33.600 --> 21:43.320]  online and that ties in to big judge big judge up in Wisconsin former president
[21:43.320 --> 21:47.160]  of drag queen story hour that's the pedophile story hour foundation and
[21:47.160 --> 21:53.600]  children's court judge a children's court judge my my my arrested on seven
[21:53.600 --> 22:03.560]  counts of child porn it's a club it's a guild it's an army it's a force and just
[22:03.560 --> 22:09.520]  like at Penn State you had Jerry Sandusky supplying children through the
[22:09.520 --> 22:13.720]  abused children foundation to famous people that would come into town and
[22:13.720 --> 22:18.480]  quote the nine and ten eleven-year-old children would stay with the celebrities
[22:18.480 --> 22:23.880]  in their own little cottages yes I have hundreds of articles of drag queen
[22:23.880 --> 22:28.840]  story time leaders being busted kidnapping children raping children a lot
[22:28.840 --> 22:33.600]  of them have child rape convictions of three-year-olds five-year-olds six-year-olds
[22:33.600 --> 22:40.440]  and a surprising number of them are family court judges family court judges
[22:40.440 --> 22:45.720]  isn't that just interesting and the Trump's credit he was really cracking
[22:45.720 --> 22:50.840]  down on that and law enforcement's credit they know what to target oh he was
[22:50.840 --> 22:58.480]  also the leader of Wisconsin's LBGTQP literally P society and all over the
[22:58.480 --> 23:03.440]  place the leaders of the LGBT movements keep getting arrested for having sex
[23:03.440 --> 23:08.600]  with ten-year-olds and eleven-year-olds because the truth is it wasn't about gay
[23:08.600 --> 23:12.920]  marriage it was always about sex with your children because it's a satanic
[23:12.920 --> 23:17.080]  ritual to drain off their energy to drain off their innocence and drain off
[23:17.080 --> 23:21.160]  their their their future the only thing they like better is chopping your
[23:21.160 --> 23:24.720]  children up with a meat cleaver while they rape them and I'm sorry to tell you
[23:24.720 --> 23:30.240]  that but that's what the big boys do put up Renfield this judge you take one
[23:30.240 --> 23:32.760]  look at him like a
[23:32.760 --> 23:37.560]  Sandusky type he has the little piggy face the little piggy eyes the little
[23:37.560 --> 23:43.960]  piggy soft demeanor of a supplier that's a supplier right there that's what I
[23:43.960 --> 23:50.680]  call a Renfield model not a Dracula or dragon model let's pull up Prince
[23:50.680 --> 23:55.400]  Philip when he got out of the hospital yesterday let's show you a dragon model
[23:55.400 --> 24:01.720]  that's a Renfield model let's show you a dracool or Dracula model and again they
[24:01.720 --> 24:07.440]  don't live forever but the spirits in them are very very old and so you've got
[24:07.440 --> 24:11.240]  a little supply gremlin right there and then you can also pull up one of their
[24:11.240 --> 24:16.120]  generals everybody wants to see one I would say that Chuck Schumer is a general
[24:16.120 --> 24:20.720]  you could take one look plus the evidence you wiener was his protege you could
[24:20.720 --> 24:24.720]  take one look at Sasha bear a Cohen or one look at Prince Philip yeah blow that
[24:24.720 --> 24:29.520]  up full screen for folks and that is a heavy-hitter operator right there you
[24:29.520 --> 24:34.560]  see that you see a Brian Stelter he's segwaying from Renfield into heavy
[24:34.560 --> 24:39.920]  hitter that's that's that's what we put Stelter on screen now please
[24:39.920 --> 24:46.560]  Stelter is now segwaying into Dracula mode they don't normally promote people
[24:46.560 --> 24:51.080]  from Renfield to Dracula but he is being promoted and you can see him enjoying
[24:51.080 --> 24:56.600]  strutting his demonic possession there on the red carpet he also I'm sure would
[24:56.600 --> 25:00.600]  love to babysit your children but this judge oh they also just busted that big
[25:00.600 --> 25:05.840]  top trans YouTube star who ran a daycare of course out of their house for
[25:05.840 --> 25:10.120]  reportedly child porn and the reports of them raping children and that goes
[25:10.120 --> 25:17.040]  together like flies on big old piles of dog manure doesn't it there you go
[25:17.040 --> 25:21.200]  transgender YouTube star downloaded child sex images while running child daycare
[25:21.200 --> 25:23.960]  service then you just read a little footnote oh there were previous reports
[25:23.960 --> 25:29.080]  that he was he and his husband her husband were raping kids but they're
[25:29.080 --> 25:31.960]  like well we didn't you know they're transgender so we can't look into that
[25:31.960 --> 25:38.040]  I mean it's just a dude with a wig that wants access to children and of course
[25:38.040 --> 25:42.040]  take one look those are Renfields Renfields Renfields Renfields can we
[25:42.040 --> 25:46.200]  put a Dracula back on screen please because again Bram Stoker was writing
[25:46.200 --> 25:49.680]  about allegories of what he witnessed but was known in high society in London
[25:49.680 --> 25:55.440]  that a count comes to town and boy does he like to drink the blood of women and
[25:55.440 --> 26:01.080]  babies when you see those old 1920s 30s 40s movies where he brings a baby in into
[26:01.080 --> 26:04.440]  the black Sabbath with all the beautiful women and they all descend on the baby
[26:04.440 --> 26:07.800]  her drinks blood that's actually how they do it they'll give a baby alive for a
[26:07.800 --> 26:17.040]  full day while they lance it and drain the blood off so liberal and oh don't
[26:17.040 --> 26:22.440]  worry though Twitter will ban you now if you call pedophilia bad pedophilia is
[26:22.440 --> 26:26.800]  good good good according to Twitter and it's remember everybody that works there

[27:40.440 --> 27:46.200]  without any mental reservation for purpose of evasion and that I will well and
[27:46.200 --> 27:52.840]  faithfully discharge my duties as best as I can so help me God info wars.com

[30:09.520 --> 30:14.600]  want to call them they're highly predatory and are setting up a false
[30:14.600 --> 30:19.760]  fantasy land system of constant bombardment of propaganda drugs and
[30:19.760 --> 30:27.320]  electromagnetic radiation to change the very DNA of the human species to mutate
[30:27.320 --> 30:32.600]  us into a form that they can control like a pawn on a chessboard the bottom

[30:44.880 --> 30:48.000]  what's happening with the world order but at the end of the day it's all about
[30:48.000 --> 30:51.120]  the population it's all about world government it's all about the end of
[30:51.120 --> 30:55.280]  human system as we know it and on its ashes a nightmare being built only

[32:03.040 --> 32:08.040]  salute and thank you all okay without getting into a history lesson I'm sure
[32:08.040 --> 32:11.360]  a lot of you tune in you already have your own views you've done your own
[32:11.360 --> 32:15.520]  research but here's just a basic recap of facts before I hit the latest over the
[32:15.520 --> 32:27.360]  top news and play this video clip of the aged, daughtering, deviant, demented,
[32:27.360 --> 32:40.400]  addled, Alzheimer, riddled, brain rotted, dementia, cursed, Joe Biden
[32:40.400 --> 32:44.320]  and anybody that knows about dementia knows that the sweetest grandfather or
[32:44.320 --> 32:48.920]  grandmother when they get into dementia they are demented and guys we hope the
[32:48.920 --> 32:54.960]  definition of demented please means acting like a demon doing devious
[32:54.960 --> 33:02.440]  things hurting yourself riding on the walls with feces think a pervert and
[33:02.440 --> 33:08.360]  there's a lot of things that happen when the brain starts degenerating demented
[33:08.360 --> 33:19.120]  mad or insane suffering from or exhibiting cognitive dementia at least
[33:19.120 --> 33:25.640]  one-third of people service caregivers for a demented husband or wife become
[33:25.640 --> 33:31.480]  chronically depressed well now as a nation we have a demented which comes
[33:31.480 --> 33:38.880]  from the word demonic or demoniac in the Latin look up some of the other words
[33:38.880 --> 33:50.280]  you could connect to Biden diabolical of the devil of the oblo and so there he is
[33:50.280 --> 33:55.840]  up there not knowing what planet he's on and he's on national TV saying that
[33:55.840 --> 34:03.400]  Russia's gonna pay soon and that they're gonna be coming after them and that
[34:03.400 --> 34:07.920]  Putin's a killer with no soul and that's why Putin then said you actually need to
[34:07.920 --> 34:13.680]  look in the mirror let's talk about what Putin has done what Putin's really up to
[34:13.680 --> 34:19.480]  Putin slashed the Russian defense budget in the last eight years over and over
[34:19.480 --> 34:23.840]  again he pulled troops out of all these other places he launched a national
[34:23.840 --> 34:28.480]  organic drives and they want to supply the world organic food and with cleaner
[34:28.480 --> 34:33.280]  fossil fuels they have a program to promote marriage and Christianity and
[34:33.280 --> 34:37.960]  they are decrying the Carnegie Foundation the Ford Foundation Rockefeller
[34:37.960 --> 34:42.440]  Foundation the Soros foundations and are saying they want to post human world
[34:42.440 --> 34:46.440]  and that Russia is not for it and so the globalists are very very upset because
[34:46.440 --> 34:52.120]  they had Russia for 80 plus years in their demonic clutches and now they
[34:52.120 --> 34:56.160]  don't know what to do and so they're trying to start a war it's China that
[34:56.160 --> 34:59.760]  has the biggest Navy it's China that is already overtaken us economically it's
[34:59.760 --> 35:02.360]  China that produced more billionaires last year than all billionaires combined
[35:02.360 --> 35:07.680]  it's China that's had everything rigged for them and been given all the money
[35:07.680 --> 35:13.960]  transfers and the technology transfers Russia's got nothing because Russia
[35:13.960 --> 35:17.320]  struggled free from the globalist and Russia was just a communist government
[35:17.320 --> 35:20.360]  meant to kill Christians and destroy Russian culture but the Russians threw
[35:20.360 --> 35:24.560]  it off of them and have now partially got control of their country so they're
[35:24.560 --> 35:28.280]  the model of resistance just like Brazil and just like we were becoming
[35:28.280 --> 35:31.800]  with President Trump and there was a linking up of that and that's what
[35:31.800 --> 35:40.560]  Putin saw was real peace and an end of global domination well the New World
[35:40.560 --> 35:44.800]  Order is not going to be putting up with that they put out their propaganda
[35:44.800 --> 35:48.320]  that you know Trump was this Russian minion and the rest of it well there
[35:48.320 --> 35:51.680]  was never any evidence of that at the contrary the Russians would try to buy
[35:51.680 --> 35:55.360]  people off for their aims and I'm not saying they're cream puffs or perfect
[35:55.360 --> 36:00.120]  angels and they did have Hillary on the payroll to a great extent but that's
[36:00.120 --> 36:04.400]  all shifting away now because Putin will not give access to their children to
[36:04.400 --> 36:07.640]  drag Queen story times and pedophile training that's all over the news here
[36:07.640 --> 36:17.360]  the religion of the left is destroying children period so let's go ahead and
[36:17.360 --> 36:21.720]  get to this clip Russia recalls ambassador after Joe Biden threatens
[36:21.720 --> 36:32.080]  Vladimir Putin and calls him a killer with no soul and then goes on to say he
[36:32.080 --> 36:37.320]  will be paying soon so extreme threats by a man with a nuclear football that
[36:37.320 --> 36:41.400]  Russia and Putin will be paying soon well we've got US troops all over their
[36:41.400 --> 36:45.400]  borders giving heavy weapons to rebels they're attacking Russian troops we're
[36:45.400 --> 36:48.800]  trying to take over their oil fields that the Russians built that they control
[36:48.800 --> 36:55.680]  their 80% Russian in eastern Ukraine these are acts of war while they dissolve
[36:55.680 --> 37:03.760]  our borders while the globalist ship in record fentanyl 360 plus percent in
[37:03.760 --> 37:07.600]  just a year ago into the US they're at war with Russia they're at war with
[37:07.600 --> 37:11.640]  America the globalist want to bring down every sovereign state and now the
[37:11.640 --> 37:17.320]  chai comms have their beachhead and so now in the year 2021 as we sit around
[37:17.320 --> 37:25.240]  this Thursday March 18th transmission Putin responds back wishing Biden good
[37:25.240 --> 37:30.880]  health after killer comments about the Russian leader and Putin came out last
[37:30.880 --> 37:35.120]  week and said America needs peace the riot at the Capitol is not that big a
[37:35.120 --> 37:38.720]  deal everybody needs to unify you to make your country strong you need to
[37:38.720 --> 37:45.360]  strengthen your nation my god if Putin was a in control of Trump wow what a
[37:45.360 --> 37:49.000]  buddy though he wasn't trying to control our borders trying to not do one side
[37:49.000 --> 37:52.160]  of the old China trying to restore our Republic trying to take care of the
[37:52.160 --> 37:56.920]  veterans yeah no the truth is is that Putin talks about an ideology of
[37:56.920 --> 38:01.360]  Christianity and nationalism to defeat globalism the neoliberal globalist
[38:01.360 --> 38:05.320]  soulless system that's exactly what his former chief of staff in fact put me
[38:05.320 --> 38:09.080]  that letter again please talked about that I read on air last week I'm gonna
[38:09.080 --> 38:13.400]  read that again today but here's why they're so enraged here's why they want
[38:13.400 --> 38:18.920]  to start a war here's why they want to trick Putin in responding in any way so
[38:18.920 --> 38:22.800]  you get us into a major war with Russia at the behest of China these globalists
[38:22.800 --> 38:27.880]  are out of control ladies and gentlemen we're all in grave danger here is the
[38:27.880 --> 38:33.360]  demented one the stooge the puppet the pretender the globalist frontman the
[38:33.360 --> 38:39.360]  Shaikom agent Joe Biden on national TV making incredible threats
[38:39.360 --> 38:44.280]  authorized operations during the election to under denigrate you support
[38:44.280 --> 38:49.800]  President Trump undermine our elections divide our society what price must he
[38:49.800 --> 38:54.560]  pay he will pay a price I we had a long talk he and I what we I know him
[38:54.560 --> 38:59.560]  relatively well and the conversation started off I said I know you and you
[38:59.560 --> 39:04.240]  know me if I establish this occurred then be prepared you said you know he
[39:04.240 --> 39:09.560]  doesn't have a soul I did say that to him yes and to and his response was we
[39:09.560 --> 39:13.000]  understand one another I wouldn't be a wise guy I was alone with him in his
[39:13.000 --> 39:17.360]  office that's how it came about it was when President Bush had said I've looked
[39:17.360 --> 39:22.240]  in his eyes and saw a soul I said look to your eyes and I don't think you have a
[39:22.240 --> 39:26.640]  soul and look back me said we understand each other look most important thing
[39:26.640 --> 39:30.000]  dealing with foreign leaders in my experience and I've dealt with an
[39:30.000 --> 39:34.920]  awful lot of more of my career is just know the other guy so you know Vladimir
[39:34.920 --> 39:40.400]  Putin you think he's a killer I do so what price must he pay the price he's
[39:40.400 --> 39:45.000]  gonna pay well you'll see shortly I'm not gonna there's by the way we ought to
[39:45.000 --> 39:48.560]  be able that old that tried expression walking chew gum at the same time
[39:48.560 --> 39:53.000]  there are places where it's in our mutual interest to work together that's
[39:53.000 --> 39:57.520]  why I renewed the start agreement with him that heck that occurred while he's
[39:57.520 --> 40:01.560]  doing this but that's overwhelming interest in humanity that we diminish
[40:01.560 --> 40:05.840]  the prospect of a nuclear exchange this is the same guy that over and over again
[40:05.840 --> 40:08.880]  said he was gonna take Trump behind a building and beat the hell out of him
[40:08.880 --> 40:14.320]  when he can hardly walk so he's a corrupt knuckle-dragging lawyer who sold
[40:14.320 --> 40:19.000]  his country up to Communist Chinese he has a horrible drug addict son the whole
[40:19.000 --> 40:23.160]  family are a bunch of pedophiles I mean it's just just the whole family I mean
[40:23.160 --> 40:28.360]  there's photos of Hunter with the niece having sex there's all of them and they
[40:28.360 --> 40:32.480]  just don't care and no one's ever punished them and so now he's saying he's
[40:32.480 --> 40:39.680]  gonna punish Russia and and Russia will soon see they're gonna pay man talk
[40:39.680 --> 40:43.200]  about threats talk about evil talk about America in deep trouble we're under

[42:10.960 --> 42:15.560]  and attain immortality but the price for that is to carry out the orderly
[42:15.560 --> 42:21.640]  extermination of all carbon-based line forms that's why they say carbon is bad
[42:21.640 --> 42:27.000]  they are rewriting the entire genetic code of the planet they are playing god

[49:59.720 --> 50:05.600]  which is your operation on the air all right let me do this because I can't in
[50:05.600 --> 50:09.360]  five minutes or six minutes do it justice in this segment but when I start
[50:09.360 --> 50:16.160]  the next hour I'm gonna get into humanoid and what that means and how
[50:16.160 --> 50:20.560]  much how many times I've told you about this and I want to be very very clear I
[50:20.560 --> 50:27.480]  didn't predict this they admitted to producing humanoids 50 years ago it's
[50:27.480 --> 50:32.480]  50 years ago right about 50 years ago humanoids were already created and by
[50:32.480 --> 50:36.280]  the way humanoids were taken to term there there are humanoids quite a few
[50:36.280 --> 50:40.000]  of them we don't know the actual numbers but a lot of governments worked on them
[50:40.000 --> 50:44.120]  so when you see movies in the 80s about replicants they already have them but
[50:44.120 --> 50:47.320]  they're not supermen most of them are mentally retarded have horrible genetic
[50:47.320 --> 50:51.600]  disorders and are just in hellish situations I mean let me give you an
[50:51.600 --> 50:56.440]  example and I can't find a video if somebody finds it to me I remember 15
[50:56.440 --> 51:01.800]  16 years ago on Fox News they said oh look in South Korea you can pay a couple
[51:01.800 --> 51:06.360]  thousand dollars to get a glowing Reese's monkey that glows in the dark there
[51:06.360 --> 51:11.360]  are articles about it but I haven't seen the video of the little monkey and the
[51:11.360 --> 51:15.240]  problem is that sometimes it produces stinging cells so that stinging cells
[51:15.240 --> 51:19.440]  start dripping out of its back and burning it but you can get glow in the
[51:19.440 --> 51:25.520]  dark blue Reese's monkeys I just thought I'd tell you about that because they made
[51:25.520 --> 51:28.920]  them part jellyfish so they're also animal human hybrids and this is all in
[51:28.920 --> 51:32.520]  the mainline literature and some of it sold just like a movie Blade Runner on
[51:32.520 --> 51:37.040]  the streets in Asia because anything goes as you know in places like Thailand
[51:37.040 --> 51:41.120]  South Korea China oh yeah there's some of the glowing monkeys for you people
[51:41.120 --> 51:46.240]  think I'm lying about it and pull up mainstream articles about it but now it's
[51:46.240 --> 51:53.280]  being reported scientists lab creations of living model embryos raise ethics
[51:53.280 --> 51:59.640]  concerns and they say oh well they're not pure human that it is a living embryo
[51:59.640 --> 52:04.760]  but don't worry it doesn't have any rights so they're now this is a coming
[52:04.760 --> 52:10.520]  out the mRNA vaccines the gene mutation systems this is the big bum rush this is
[52:10.520 --> 52:13.880]  just a big emergence of all this they've already got developed fifty years
[52:13.880 --> 52:17.880]  ahead of what you know about and they're just gonna roll it out now they're
[52:17.880 --> 52:22.000]  gonna make you so deathly sick with what you've been injected with of the vaccine
[52:22.000 --> 52:27.560]  actually destroys your your DNA with with mRNA it actually takes you over and
[52:27.560 --> 52:30.520]  so you'll have to be under their control even live in the future we'll be able to
[52:30.520 --> 52:33.920]  have children either go get a designer baby made but you think your cell phone
[52:33.920 --> 52:38.000]  estrogen horses in it boy you ain't see nothing yet so we're not just gonna get
[52:38.000 --> 52:42.480]  rid of humanity we're gonna be replaced with the humanoid so I'm gonna give you
[52:42.480 --> 52:48.160]  the rest of the story when we come back and and and here's the promise that Joe
[52:48.160 --> 52:52.800]  Biden and Ted Turner and Bill Gates have been given by the little nasty dudes
[52:52.800 --> 52:56.640]  giving them this technology you might have heard other than their Bible calls
[52:56.640 --> 53:02.960]  them demons none of this world not very friendly they're being promised life
[53:02.960 --> 53:08.400]  extension but they first got to kill us and test on us and the truth is these
[53:08.400 --> 53:13.160]  beings just want to torture us and mutate us and do horrible things to
[53:13.160 --> 53:16.880]  us because they know what we grow into and what we do if we're kept pure and
[53:16.880 --> 53:21.640]  and come together as a species but that is not the case this is actually a
[53:21.640 --> 53:27.480]  giant genetic war on the planet and we've been set up for this so I just think
[53:27.480 --> 53:32.400]  you should get ready for that and understand how incredibly serious all
[53:32.400 --> 53:36.240]  this is but if you're a new listener and you notice all the jokes for over a
[53:36.240 --> 53:40.400]  decade about the gay frogs and oh Jones claims chemicals are making you know the
[53:40.400 --> 53:46.560]  frogs gay and all the rest of it it's not just gay it's sterile and again you
[53:46.560 --> 53:49.000]  have to go in and get genetically engineered even be able to have babies
[53:49.000 --> 53:52.560]  now but it'll be the babies they want you to have that aren't truly human but
[53:52.560 --> 53:57.400]  that under the trans system if you gotta have men and women sports well you're
[53:57.400 --> 54:02.040]  gonna have a augmented or genetically engineered humans in regular sports and
[54:02.040 --> 54:05.520]  it'll be oh they're trans you can't criticize them but they'll be
[54:05.520 --> 54:10.120]  corporately controlled they'll be genetically engineered and they'll also
[54:10.120 --> 54:16.760]  be time-stamped they'll be pre-programmed with artificial epigenetic memory what
[54:16.760 --> 54:20.400]  you call instincts to carry out the globalist operations and oh and the
[54:20.400 --> 54:23.600]  instinct they're gonna have is what the royals would breed to get it's called
[54:23.600 --> 54:30.080]  evil see we have our wireless system where we're able to communicate with God
[54:30.080 --> 54:33.440]  and then the universe God created well they have their system that they're
[54:33.440 --> 54:37.040]  creating and right now they need to create these humanoids to do it so if
[54:37.040 --> 54:41.520]  you'll accept a six foot three man you know on a volleyball team with women or
[54:41.520 --> 54:45.040]  rugby team well then you're gonna accept robots and say they have rights as well
[54:45.040 --> 54:48.280]  so get ready oh by the way you'll have no rights though remember you're not
[54:48.280 --> 54:53.160]  essential only if you're gay or trans or genetically engineered will you have
[54:53.160 --> 54:57.040]  any rights and they'll be celebrated and loved and watching a man beat women up
[54:57.040 --> 55:02.160]  will be called look at that girl go playing rugby and so and so this is
[55:02.160 --> 55:06.080]  it humanities being taught not to stand up for our unborn or stand up for our
[55:06.080 --> 55:11.320]  old so no one will stand up for you and the average little trendy at Google or
[55:11.320 --> 55:15.360]  Facebook or Twitter they're already pedophiles they love it they've already
[55:15.360 --> 55:19.080]  signed on the first dotted line with Satan to want to have sex with children
[55:19.080 --> 55:24.320]  and destroy their innocence after that it cuts the transmission with God and in
[55:24.320 --> 55:28.160]  all they get some satanic transmission and then they get rewritten very very
[55:28.160 --> 55:36.120]  quickly and are lost they burn they shake as they lose control of their souls
[55:36.120 --> 55:41.080]  well they're right back on the other side our number two

[56:47.920 --> 56:51.760]  throughout history there have been two basic forms of civilizations and
[56:51.760 --> 56:55.600]  different mixes of the two one is born of remiss on the other is born of
[56:55.600 --> 57:00.280]  conquest one bases its power on having strong enlightened focused people with
[57:00.280 --> 57:06.360]  an ethos and a culture and ingenuity art and skill and strength the other is
[57:06.360 --> 57:11.640]  based on the massive number of slaves it controls with a tiny elite above it
[57:11.640 --> 57:16.360]  America is transferring out of a system based on the ethos of liberty and
[57:16.360 --> 57:21.320]  freedom into one of total mass high-tech slavery that's why the globalists
[57:21.320 --> 57:24.840]  tell us America's family of slavery when it wasn't they point out one of our
[57:24.840 --> 57:28.600]  evils so they can invert the facts that they are truly the slave masters a
[57:28.600 --> 57:32.760]  global permanent lockdown is here it's already causing millions and millions
[57:32.760 --> 57:36.400]  of starving death when they're done billions will starve to death even the
[57:36.400 --> 57:39.760]  former head of the Ministry of Defense in England and a top general have come
[57:39.760 --> 57:44.160]  out said the covered lockdown is going to trigger a giant new world war that's
[57:44.160 --> 57:48.680]  the fact this is the Bill Gates new world order weapon
[57:49.680 --> 57:55.160]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[58:01.040 --> 58:06.160]  I'm about to air my emergency message to former president Trump concerning his
[58:06.160 --> 58:14.680]  major misstep saying the vaccines are safe they're not they're not vaccines if
[58:14.680 --> 58:21.560]  you are receiving this transmission you are the resistance live from the info
[58:21.560 --> 58:28.360]  wars dot com studios it's Alex Jones the video is on info wars dot com and man
[58:28.360 --> 58:33.120]  dot video if you choose to share it if we may get it to Trump emergency measures
[58:33.120 --> 58:37.560]  of Trump covered vaccines are deadly poison Washington Post had a big
[58:37.560 --> 58:42.080]  article yesterday titled cold war between Trump and Tucker cuz Tucker's
[58:42.080 --> 58:47.680]  figuring out the vaccines are bad their gene therapy their toxic and so now
[58:47.680 --> 58:50.960]  Trump comes out he knows he signed on to this he's been conned so now he's
[58:50.960 --> 58:54.920]  doubling down oh it's safe take it but they admit it's got all these adverse
[58:54.920 --> 58:59.080]  reactions they admit it's a gene therapy they admit it was never properly
[58:59.080 --> 59:03.280]  tested they admit that they brought gene therapy in under the liability protection
[59:03.280 --> 59:09.040]  of vaccines it's a huge fraud and the world is turning against it Bill Gates's
[59:09.040 --> 59:15.120]  plan the globalist plan it's not going well ladies and gentlemen and so here
[59:15.120 --> 59:19.280]  is my emergency message to the real president of the United States who we
[59:19.280 --> 59:22.600]  know overalls a good guy who the globalist hate to realize this is not a
[59:22.600 --> 59:27.680]  normal vaccine mr. president you must come out and expose Fauci you've already
[59:27.680 --> 59:31.560]  done it and the rest of them is lying to you you must get as far away as you can
[59:31.560 --> 59:35.920]  from this instead of doubling down and being part of the fraud here's the
[59:35.920 --> 59:40.120]  emergency message again it's at info wars.com please share it we'll be back
[59:40.120 --> 59:45.880]  on the other side a word a warning to you my fellow Americans the second dose
[59:45.880 --> 59:52.280]  of the COVID-19 vaccine is no joke I had the COVID booster Moderna about four
[59:52.280 --> 59:57.800]  or five days ago and I am still feeling wild side effects from it it made me
[59:57.800 --> 1:00:01.840]  feel worse than I felt in a long time like I had the worst flu in the world
[1:00:01.840 --> 1:00:07.960]  extreme shortness of breath I just felt so bad a dizziness fatigue shaking
[1:00:07.960 --> 1:00:14.280]  chills fever extremely irrational thinking aches headaches and it has just
[1:00:14.280 --> 1:00:20.240]  been devastating just felt miserable I recently took the COVID-19 vaccination
[1:00:20.240 --> 1:00:28.400]  after the shot I felt fine but within three days I went to the doctor because
[1:00:28.400 --> 1:00:36.800]  I had problems with my face the whole left side of my face actually I have
[1:00:36.800 --> 1:00:41.760]  bell palsy now Cassidy got the second Moderna shot on a Monday by Thursday
[1:00:41.760 --> 1:00:47.520]  morning they were in the ER she got sick right away the death of his youngest
[1:00:47.520 --> 1:00:52.160]  daughter Cassidy came out of nowhere four days after her second dose of the
[1:00:52.160 --> 1:00:57.160]  COVID-19 vaccine everybody from her work had kind of had flu-like symptoms just
[1:00:57.160 --> 1:01:00.560]  like the nurses telling us earlier today when we got tested she experienced
[1:01:00.560 --> 1:01:04.560]  chills she said all her friends did too yep all her friends did there's a report
[1:01:04.560 --> 1:01:08.360]  from the New York Times that there's been a severe allergic reaction from a
[1:01:08.360 --> 1:01:12.480]  health care worker in Alaska after receiving the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine
[1:01:12.480 --> 1:01:16.560]  Patriot doctor in Missouri works at nursing home and wants to comment on
[1:01:16.560 --> 1:01:22.360]  COVID vaccines yeah hi Alex so I'm a jury true I'm family medicine trained
[1:01:22.360 --> 1:01:28.880]  I'm a jury tradition I work in nursing homes I have had 21 patients that I've
[1:01:28.880 --> 1:01:33.680]  identified that have died within 48 hours of getting either the first or
[1:01:33.680 --> 1:01:44.080]  second vaccine from AstraZeneca she was healthy happy active the greatest mom
[1:01:44.080 --> 1:01:49.920]  you ever saw in your life and then she was so sick that she was you know in
[1:01:49.920 --> 1:01:55.200]  less than probably 12 hours she was intubated and on life support and then
[1:01:55.200 --> 1:02:01.120]  she passed when you get this spike protein antibody in your system it will
[1:02:01.120 --> 1:02:05.800]  permanently and irreversibly change your immune system when you inject this
[1:02:05.800 --> 1:02:11.760]  shot that has this polyethylene glycol on the coating on the outside of it that
[1:02:11.760 --> 1:02:16.640]  is what is leading to anaphylactic reactions shock and death I think we're
[1:02:16.640 --> 1:02:22.120]  going to see massive injuries and a lot more deaths start somewhere between four
[1:02:22.120 --> 1:02:26.480]  and 18 months from now would you recommend to our audience that they get
[1:02:26.480 --> 1:02:31.200]  the vaccine then I would I would recommend it and I would recommend it to a
[1:02:31.200 --> 1:02:35.720]  lot of people that don't want to get it and a lot of those people voted for me
[1:02:35.720 --> 1:02:47.160]  frankly you don't have to lay down you climb back against these monsters get
[1:02:47.160 --> 1:02:51.080]  the video share it it's a band-aid video emergency message from double vaccines
[1:02:51.080 --> 1:02:57.240]  are deadly poison or in the world listeners ask me all the time why do
[1:02:57.240 --> 1:03:01.840]  you have multiple multivitamins why do you have multiple high-quality iodine
[1:03:01.840 --> 1:03:05.920]  why do you do that because different strokes for different folks if we're
[1:03:05.920 --> 1:03:09.400]  talking to researchers and scientists and they say hey a lot of people love
[1:03:09.400 --> 1:03:12.880]  deep earth pure crystal iodine but you should put one out with deeper crystal
[1:03:12.880 --> 1:03:16.680]  iodine and the two other types because some people can't absorb pure iodine
[1:03:16.680 --> 1:03:21.240]  boom we did it it's popular it's x3 is it better than x2 you decide it's
[1:03:21.240 --> 1:03:24.840]  different strokes different folks well now we have a compliment to knock out
[1:03:24.840 --> 1:03:30.280]  our very popular powdered pill sleeping and that is down and out it's super
[1:03:30.280 --> 1:03:34.200]  strong way stronger than knockout but they don't compete with each other

[1:04:20.520 --> 1:04:30.280]  FEMA region 6 Austin Texas transmitting worldwide it's Alex Jones it's Thursday
[1:04:30.280 --> 1:04:35.640]  March 18th 2021 year of our Lord I'm Alex Jones coming to you from the Central
[1:04:35.640 --> 1:04:39.760]  Texas Resistance Center building a pro-human future against the globalist
[1:04:39.760 --> 1:04:45.680]  transhumanist post-industrial world I know God's real and I know this is a
[1:04:45.680 --> 1:04:51.840]  test and so I am of good cheer but make no mistake what you're receiving here
[1:04:51.840 --> 1:04:55.800]  what you're hearing here is as close to the truth as you're going to get we're
[1:04:55.800 --> 1:04:59.440]  all human we're all fallible we're all fallen we all see through that rose
[1:04:59.440 --> 1:05:05.160]  colored darkly that's scanner darkly but I can tell you this is the testament of
[1:05:05.160 --> 1:05:12.600]  what is happening now I want to give the number up because we've got scores of
[1:05:12.600 --> 1:05:18.000]  medical doctors in Russia in Japan in China or they get arrested in Africa and
[1:05:18.000 --> 1:05:23.120]  in Mexico there is a Latin America in right here in Texas coming out like 10
[1:05:23.120 --> 1:05:29.320]  15 a day I can't even watch them all I heard this the big Irish doctor at the
[1:05:29.320 --> 1:05:34.360]  start of the show today just incredible powerful layer that she broke down it's
[1:05:34.360 --> 1:05:40.840]  at Europe Wars dot com gotta be spread Irish doctor exposes great reset agenda
[1:05:40.840 --> 1:05:46.320]  behind covid hugs and powerful video Dan Lyman article this is all so important
[1:05:46.320 --> 1:05:51.040]  but why are they doing it why are the globalist risking this why are they
[1:05:51.040 --> 1:05:54.960]  putting out all these different vaccines that are dangerous virus vector
[1:05:54.960 --> 1:05:58.400]  vaccines that use a live virus to deliver it through the cell membrane into
[1:05:58.400 --> 1:06:05.640]  the into the mitochondria and why are they using mRNA to program the cells to
[1:06:05.640 --> 1:06:09.200]  the ribosomes why are they doing this when I have a whole stack of articles
[1:06:09.200 --> 1:06:14.280]  from prestigious scientific publications saying nothing was ever approved in 20
[1:06:14.280 --> 1:06:19.000]  years with mRNA technology because it would work great with some people but
[1:06:19.000 --> 1:06:22.040]  kill other people and give them cancer or autoimmune disorders I'll show you
[1:06:22.040 --> 1:06:29.160]  articles here in a moment and now if you say this is mRNA technology linked to
[1:06:29.160 --> 1:06:33.400]  cancer you get banned I was on Andrew Schultz's big podcast biggest podcast
[1:06:33.400 --> 1:06:36.320]  he ever did it's on its way to be you know 10 million views the way it was
[1:06:36.320 --> 1:06:42.720]  growing and they banned it saying oh you said that mRNA technology gene therapy
[1:06:42.720 --> 1:06:46.600]  was linked to cancer that's not you're not a doctor you can't say it so I can't
[1:06:46.600 --> 1:06:50.760]  say oh here's the document but even if the doctors say it they go oh you're not
[1:06:50.760 --> 1:06:55.440]  the UN big tech is committing war crimes against humanity the heads of Google
[1:06:55.440 --> 1:07:00.960]  Facebook Twitter all of them are Nuremberg criminals now at the level of
[1:07:00.960 --> 1:07:05.320]  Joseph Mingola suppressing this information but I told you this was
[1:07:05.320 --> 1:07:08.960]  coming this is in AP this is in Reuters I first saw the article of daily wire
[1:07:08.960 --> 1:07:16.000]  Ben Shapiro scientists lab creations of living model embryos raise ethics
[1:07:16.000 --> 1:07:23.400]  questions oh they're just a model it goes on to admit it is a humanoid but not
[1:07:23.400 --> 1:07:27.360]  all of its genetics are humans so it has no rights this is how they're
[1:07:27.360 --> 1:07:31.240]  introducing it to you it was 25 years ago I was reading a BBC article when they
[1:07:31.240 --> 1:07:34.800]  were trying to roll it out then they were like well going back over 20 years in
[1:07:34.800 --> 1:07:40.040]  Costa Rica and in China and in some labs in Switzerland private labs were
[1:07:40.040 --> 1:07:44.080]  producing embryos of humans but so they wouldn't have rights they were adding
[1:07:44.080 --> 1:07:49.720]  the genetics of other animals like cows and pigs so they could then grow them
[1:07:49.720 --> 1:07:54.520]  inside the uteruses of cows so you could grow up a bigger humanoid to get
[1:07:54.520 --> 1:07:58.160]  larger organs because you don't want to just butcher a baby and they give a
[1:07:58.160 --> 1:08:03.720]  full-grown man a baby's liver you've got to grow up a humanoid that weighs 45
[1:08:03.720 --> 1:08:09.440]  50 60 pounds 70 80 pounds you know it's some of the larger cows so you get a
[1:08:09.440 --> 1:08:15.920]  bigger liver bigger kidneys and it's a human but it's enough cow that it isn't
[1:08:15.920 --> 1:08:20.600]  rejected you'll have like a you'll have a cloned female cow its genetics will be
[1:08:20.600 --> 1:08:25.240]  in the humanoid so it's not just like the humanoid has some cow genetics it has
[1:08:25.240 --> 1:08:32.520]  the genetics of the cow it's been grown in comprenday comprehend folks so this
[1:08:32.520 --> 1:08:38.560]  has been going on at least 50 years it even came out in the 80s at the Nazi
[1:08:38.560 --> 1:08:46.040]  successfully cloned rabbits that's the most fertile animal mammal we know of so
[1:08:46.040 --> 1:08:52.160]  it makes sense to travel rabbits yeah there is a glow-in-the-dark mouse they
[1:08:52.160 --> 1:08:57.000]  add jellyfish genes to it I was telling you about that earlier by the way there's
[1:08:57.000 --> 1:09:02.960]  jellyfish genes in the Pfizer mRNA vaccine and they won't tell you by
[1:09:02.960 --> 1:09:06.400]  they go it's proprietary we have emergency authorization so a Netanyahu
[1:09:06.400 --> 1:09:10.040]  and Trump and Biden tell you oh this is FDA approved no it's not it was done
[1:09:10.040 --> 1:09:14.920]  with emergency authorization not approved not tested the truth is they
[1:09:14.920 --> 1:09:17.920]  already tested all their other names for decades on animals they know what it's
[1:09:17.920 --> 1:09:21.520]  going to do infertility cancer turn your immune system off I mean this is just
[1:09:21.520 --> 1:09:25.480]  incredible scientists have officially created living forms of model embryos
[1:09:25.480 --> 1:09:31.080]  in a lab that bear a close resemblance to real human embryos the aim of the
[1:09:31.080 --> 1:09:34.240]  scientific experiment is to discover information about early development in
[1:09:34.240 --> 1:09:38.360]  human beings totally discover new methods to create fertility issues and
[1:09:38.360 --> 1:09:42.760]  stop birth defects or miscarriages oh yes they give you all the chemicals all
[1:09:42.760 --> 1:09:46.200]  the electromagnetic radiations you can't have kids but now they're going to create
[1:09:46.200 --> 1:09:53.680]  the radiation and drug resistant ones that they control isn't that cute so it's
[1:09:53.680 --> 1:10:01.200]  part human NPR reports but more human than human or a humanoid a non-human
[1:10:01.200 --> 1:10:05.040]  creature or being with characters such as ability to walk upright resembling
[1:10:05.040 --> 1:10:12.160]  those of a human or of all the ancient legends of the not so friendly little
[1:10:12.160 --> 1:10:15.640]  humanoids and that's what Aldous Huxley said he said we're going to create a
[1:10:15.640 --> 1:10:21.000]  short-servant humanoid creature in brave new world then he wrote brave new
[1:10:21.000 --> 1:10:24.680]  world revisited nonfiction admitted at all so since I mentioned all that let me
[1:10:24.680 --> 1:10:28.240]  let me just show you the stack I talked about here's Andrew Schultz last night
[1:10:28.240 --> 1:10:31.840]  so it was the best show he ever did I went on there and had some fun went crazy
[1:10:31.840 --> 1:10:37.880]  that's my comedy side but wow YouTube pulled the Alex Jones episode wow it
[1:10:37.880 --> 1:10:42.000]  had five times the viewers of any other episode they ever did on par to break Joe
[1:10:42.000 --> 1:10:47.560]  Rogan's record podcast with Elon Musk and then I'm in second place can't be
[1:10:47.560 --> 1:10:51.640]  allowed to happen what why was it banned well the word is because I talked about
[1:10:51.640 --> 1:10:56.760]  mRNA gene therapy tied to cancer COVID MRA vaccines are a form of gene
[1:10:56.760 --> 1:11:04.560]  therapy swifts Institute.org medium.com mRNA therapy a new form of gene
[1:11:04.560 --> 1:11:08.400]  medicine that's a few years ago but now that it's known they go oh no no no it's
[1:11:08.400 --> 1:11:17.480]  not mRNA it's gene therapy not a vaccine mRNA COVID-19 vaccines are really
[1:11:17.480 --> 1:11:22.120]  gene therapy and not vaccines just bioethicist we have they got liability
[1:11:22.120 --> 1:11:25.640]  protection for this giant field of medicine it's always failed and always
[1:11:25.640 --> 1:11:29.120]  cause problems by calling it vaccines now it's that wobbly protection here's
[1:11:29.120 --> 1:11:33.240]  where it's interesting a gene editing experiment on human embryos went
[1:11:33.240 --> 1:11:38.520]  horribly wrong read that from futurism.com all the horrible mutations the
[1:11:38.520 --> 1:11:43.600]  deaths the deadly viruses all of it mRNA vaccines a new era in
[1:11:43.600 --> 1:11:50.520]  vaccinology Moderna announces positive interim phase one data on its mRNA
[1:11:50.520 --> 1:11:58.960]  vaccine the cancer specific drives MRA alternative and it goes through all of
[1:11:58.960 --> 1:12:04.200]  it in PubMed and explains that mRNA is directly connected to triggering cancer
[1:12:04.200 --> 1:12:09.160]  in your DNA and there's NPR saying the same thing it will give you the
[1:12:09.160 --> 1:12:12.120]  mutations give you cancer give you the rise of the viruses can we please
[1:12:12.120 --> 1:12:18.800]  continue here the readers from PubMed bluebird scrambles to find out if it's
[1:12:18.800 --> 1:12:23.280]  gene therapy caused cancer in clinical trial oh yeah a bunch of folks that did
[1:12:23.280 --> 1:12:28.800]  it got cancer but it's no big deal cancer is a known risk of gene therapies
[1:12:28.800 --> 1:12:37.360]  really that's out of mainstream news mid-city news oh it's a known thing well
[1:12:37.360 --> 1:12:41.440]  Bill Gates in the UN say the fact checkers say the fact checkers at Facebook
[1:12:41.440 --> 1:12:46.400]  actually run on the wool on lab who on lab runs it that's not true it's a
[1:12:46.400 --> 1:12:52.360]  well-known thing but that's not true wine gene therapy cause leukemia in some
[1:12:52.360 --> 1:12:57.920]  boy in the bubble syndrome and others no immune system for some and leukemia for
[1:12:57.920 --> 1:13:02.440]  others well and that's out of science daily but again that's a few years ago
[1:13:02.440 --> 1:13:05.720]  now they've rolled this out not allowed to say that Google will block you if you
[1:13:05.720 --> 1:13:10.000]  warn anybody liver tumor and gene therapy recipient raises concerns about
[1:13:10.000 --> 1:13:16.040]  virus widely used in treatment yep that's your virus vector technology that's
[1:13:16.040 --> 1:13:20.360]  out of science mag.org I got about 100 of these you want to see some more oh but
[1:13:20.360 --> 1:13:27.600]  I'm not allowed to tell you about that I'm the bad man I'm the evil man but I've
[1:13:27.600 --> 1:13:30.760]  got a medical doctor on video saying the same thing out of Houston runs a big
[1:13:30.760 --> 1:13:34.040]  clinic but of course it's in all the literature but then we want to take your
[1:13:34.040 --> 1:13:38.760]  calls to from whistleblowers or if you love the vaccines doctors medical

[1:16:34.040 --> 1:16:51.040]  too much. Does that make me crazy? Does that make you crazy? Well, yeah cuz
[1:16:51.040 --> 1:16:56.240]  all these devil worshipers we are crazy we don't want to screw kids and burn
[1:16:56.240 --> 1:17:01.520]  down buildings and destroy the planet we're crazy all right we're taking your
[1:17:01.520 --> 1:17:04.560]  phone calls here on the alex jones show because I open the phones up without
[1:17:04.560 --> 1:17:07.920]  even calling for whistleblowers and doctor calls in and says 21 of my
[1:17:07.920 --> 1:17:11.280]  patients died after they took the shots and another nurse calls in and says a
[1:17:11.280 --> 1:17:14.240]  bunch of the patients died another caller calls in and you see it in the news
[1:17:14.240 --> 1:17:19.400]  do you see it in the literature it's not it so it's a giant test of just
[1:17:19.400 --> 1:17:23.480]  normalizing this just like ancient cultures who sacrificed their children
[1:17:23.480 --> 1:17:29.720]  or slavery was normal you know slavery went on everywhere from Japan to ancient
[1:17:29.720 --> 1:17:33.480]  Rome that every area of Africa did it every area of Latin America when it was
[1:17:33.480 --> 1:17:38.880]  Mesoamerica Christians were the first group to say stop slavery oh so we hear
[1:17:38.880 --> 1:17:43.680]  Christian nations are bad now because they know we care you're up England the
[1:17:43.680 --> 1:17:50.240]  US think about that so see slavery's back folks oh Apple runs big death cans
[1:17:50.240 --> 1:17:53.480]  that's good because they fund black lives matter and put black people in all
[1:17:53.480 --> 1:18:00.040]  their commercials man if I was in all their commercials I'd be looking out
[1:18:00.040 --> 1:18:05.280]  oh boy Bill Gates is your friend of your black yeah I don't care what color
[1:18:05.280 --> 1:18:11.600]  you are he's not your friend 877-789-2539 877-789-2539 if you just
[1:18:11.600 --> 1:18:18.280]  joined us I showed you probably 15 mainstream news articles with major
[1:18:18.280 --> 1:18:23.080]  procedures universities all of it saying gene therapy halted mRNA therapy
[1:18:23.080 --> 1:18:27.920]  halted after liver failure after death after leukemia after boy in the bubble
[1:18:27.920 --> 1:18:35.200]  syndrome but now if you say it they go oh no you're not allowed only the UN can
[1:18:35.200 --> 1:18:39.520]  make a statement about mRNA wow so they didn't just get liability protection by
[1:18:39.520 --> 1:18:44.960]  rolling it out as a vaccine a gene therapy a infusion as the head of the
[1:18:44.960 --> 1:18:49.040]  NAACP said a few days ago if I cue that up in Long Island just I'm not
[1:18:49.040 --> 1:18:53.880]  questioning the infusion I'm putting it my arm and I'm not reading what's in it
[1:18:53.880 --> 1:18:58.240]  cue that up for me and that's where you're at and she's like don't worry
[1:18:58.240 --> 1:19:01.360]  you're not gonna be able to read their insert anyways they got a bill in
[1:19:01.360 --> 1:19:05.080]  Congress to take the insert self and not have them tell you what the side effects
[1:19:05.080 --> 1:19:14.560]  are 877-789-2539 and I'm going right to your calls did it hurt you or did you
[1:19:14.560 --> 1:19:17.880]  love it we're not screen your calls nobody's calling us how they loved it
[1:19:17.880 --> 1:19:24.320]  everybody I know I have a family member well I'll just say it's my brother-in-law
[1:19:24.320 --> 1:19:30.080]  his dad's a medical doctor and he they didn't make him at the hospital he
[1:19:30.080 --> 1:19:35.200]  works out do it but he went and got it in the second shot he got the ombre's and
[1:19:35.200 --> 1:19:39.760]  was paralyzed for a couple days but he's tough he fought through it just like
[1:19:39.760 --> 1:19:43.680]  Ben Stein why he do it again how about Hank Aaron will he do it again how about
[1:19:43.680 --> 1:19:48.640]  marvelous Marvin Hagler he's gonna go oh I'm sorry they're dead so I'm at dinner
[1:19:48.640 --> 1:19:51.840]  last night for St. Patty's Day my sister and her husband are always a great
[1:19:51.840 --> 1:19:57.040]  guy and I'm hearing about his dad being his arms and legs being numb and not
[1:19:57.040 --> 1:20:02.520]  being able to move for a couple days but that's okay cuz Tim Cook's gay remember
[1:20:02.520 --> 1:20:06.800]  it's as long as it's liberal it's good all right yeah and that's just what they
[1:20:06.800 --> 1:20:09.800]  did up front and it's not even been tested publicly on animals even though
[1:20:09.800 --> 1:20:14.440]  it was it's so deadly down the road they don't want to hurt you right up
[1:20:14.440 --> 1:20:18.000]  front they don't want to warn you but it's got to be so deadly up front so that
[1:20:18.000 --> 1:20:21.200]  down the road it kills your ass and maybe his dad's tough maybe he'll make it
[1:20:21.200 --> 1:20:25.680]  but you know I'm not the one being mean about Austin's dad I'm worried about it
[1:20:25.680 --> 1:20:30.640]  everybody be in macho you know the puppet and chiefs the student chiefs
[1:20:30.640 --> 1:20:35.520]  the reanimated corpse that is the cryptkeeper Joe Biden the fraud he said
[1:20:35.520 --> 1:20:39.240]  in an interview tell me we should play he said you need to be you know you're
[1:20:39.240 --> 1:20:43.080]  being macho not taking the shot because you don't need it all you're doing is
[1:20:43.080 --> 1:20:46.920]  hurting others infecting them oh no no no everybody I know that takes the shot
[1:20:46.920 --> 1:20:50.720]  does it because they are macho they're like well I'm Hank Aaron I'll do it or
[1:20:50.720 --> 1:20:55.360]  I'm marvelous Marvin Hagler I'm I'm tougher I'm Ben Stein or you know I'm
[1:20:55.360 --> 1:21:06.040]  Austin's dad I'm Austin Rivera's dad I can just go ahead and I can take this but
[1:21:06.040 --> 1:21:11.600]  you find out it's deadly because it's not it's a gene therapy by the way you go
[1:21:11.600 --> 1:21:17.200]  to mainline doctors now they're offering gene therapies now isn't the doctor
[1:21:17.200 --> 1:21:21.520]  getting to check up few weeks ago a few months ago they're like hey everybody's
[1:21:21.520 --> 1:21:27.260]  doing it it's it's an FDA study would you like to take a gene therapy
[1:21:27.260 --> 1:21:31.600]  intervenously from women that donated their baby's placentas they say it
[1:21:31.600 --> 1:21:37.880]  rejuvenates you like 10 years and I'm like no thank you I mean that's like
[1:21:37.880 --> 1:21:41.920]  saying what I want to drink my wife's blood or something none of this is good
[1:21:41.920 --> 1:21:45.200]  this is not how we operate and sure it may have these great benefits but here's
[1:21:45.200 --> 1:21:51.000]  the thing they're testing it all on us now this is a revolution of testing a
[1:21:51.000 --> 1:21:55.640]  revolution of mad scientist a revolution of bypassing everything and
[1:21:55.640 --> 1:21:59.360]  there will be so many bad side effects and so many problems that there'll be
[1:21:59.360 --> 1:22:06.360]  all these new gene therapies to quote treat it and I've interviewed and I've
[1:22:06.360 --> 1:22:09.120]  talked to some of the heads of major genetic firms that don't want to come on
[1:22:09.120 --> 1:22:13.800]  air they said Alex we've got pretty clean gene therapies we've studied in
[1:22:13.800 --> 1:22:17.240]  animals we've got things that cure colon cancer you name it with very limited
[1:22:17.240 --> 1:22:19.920]  side effects we're not even sure there are side effects we've been setting at
[1:22:19.920 --> 1:22:24.160]  10 years FDA want to prove it they've gone ahead and approved without an
[1:22:24.160 --> 1:22:28.920]  emergency I mean in this emergency optimization we look at this it's such
[1:22:28.920 --> 1:22:33.440]  a wide-ranging protein and the mRNA that we believe it's gonna hurt people for
[1:22:33.440 --> 1:22:36.480]  sure that's going to discredit our whole industry and see they're looking at it
[1:22:36.480 --> 1:22:42.680]  for the wrong perspective this is about normalizing mass death so we're not in
[1:22:42.680 --> 1:22:47.800]  Kansas anymore so who do we got here Ken is a medical worker inpatient on
[1:22:47.800 --> 1:22:53.080]  vaccines Matt is a father took vaccine as issues now Matthew ER tech medical
[1:22:53.080 --> 1:22:58.640]  worker has covered comments Janelle as in Kansas family friend took vaccine had
[1:22:58.640 --> 1:23:04.240]  stroke after Tamara sisters of nurse being forced to take vaccine let's stop
[1:23:04.240 --> 1:23:08.480]  let's not cut anybody short let's go to break and I'm not gonna talk when I come
[1:23:08.480 --> 1:23:15.000]  back I'm gonna go right to Matthew Tamara Janelle Matt and Ken and the

[1:26:51.280 --> 1:26:59.680]  Humanity has been domesticated by and large the population has been trained
[1:26:59.680 --> 1:27:03.600]  to submit do what you're told that's all gonna pass but if you study
[1:27:03.600 --> 1:27:07.120]  authoritarians if you say the globalists you understand that they reach a point
[1:27:07.120 --> 1:27:10.560]  where all the training is just beta and you go into the point of being cold
[1:27:10.560 --> 1:27:14.240]  being totally enslaved and because the globalists see us as weak and see us as
[1:27:14.240 --> 1:27:18.160]  stupid they are now making that move and they are collapsing the third world
[1:27:18.160 --> 1:27:21.800]  with their economic weapons to then flood us with the third world that the
[1:27:21.800 --> 1:27:27.040]  UN will use as a weapon to then have us under such a crises under such a load
[1:27:27.040 --> 1:27:31.440]  capitulate to the UN whatever agreements they want us to sign hoping that they
[1:27:31.440 --> 1:27:37.000]  will stop the flood of tens of millions of refugees not fleeing COVID or climate
[1:27:37.000 --> 1:27:40.840]  change as the UN and Klaus Schwabber saying and Bill Gates is saying but
[1:27:40.840 --> 1:27:46.080]  fleeing the year-long lockdowns that the UN and Bill Gates ordered them to
[1:27:46.080 --> 1:27:51.960]  institute or they wouldn't get more IMF and World Bank money and that's why we
[1:27:51.960 --> 1:28:02.760]  have to really get educated about the globalist the answer to 1984 is 1776

[1:29:59.560 --> 1:30:03.120]  uncensored we just want your name where you're calling from and a good phone
[1:30:03.120 --> 1:30:09.040]  line Ralph is calling him from Tennessee and he's got a testimonial about his
[1:30:09.040 --> 1:30:15.120]  experience with the vaccine Ralph thanks for calling go ahead sure hey Alex yeah
[1:30:15.120 --> 1:30:20.040]  not so Tennessee two weeks ago my dad passed away three weeks prior to that
[1:30:20.040 --> 1:30:25.400]  he had the Moderna vaccine and as soon as he got the vaccine he started feeling
[1:30:25.400 --> 1:30:31.200]  just terrible and just went downhill ended up just everything shutting down
[1:30:31.200 --> 1:30:38.000]  and him passing and yeah I had three ICU nurses tell me it was I had to be the
[1:30:38.000 --> 1:30:46.320]  vaccine and because they've seen this with many other people I begged him not
[1:30:46.320 --> 1:30:51.680]  to get the vaccine but he felt like he had about and why is that because they
[1:30:51.680 --> 1:30:55.600]  tell men particularly be tough protect others and so they by the way they
[1:30:55.600 --> 1:30:58.920]  admit that it doesn't protect you from COVID see that's why you've got to get
[1:30:58.920 --> 1:31:03.920]  that literature to him did you get that literature to him I did I did but he
[1:31:03.920 --> 1:31:08.960]  just he just felt like that's the only way you get back to normalcy and be
[1:31:08.960 --> 1:31:13.040]  able to get out and do things exactly they held him hostage and so he thought
[1:31:13.040 --> 1:31:16.160]  it was the right people want to get through something so he was told here's
[1:31:16.160 --> 1:31:20.480]  the solution and wow what did he think I'm so sorry yep talk about this but
[1:31:20.480 --> 1:31:24.720]  it'll save lives was he awake before he died did he wake up before it killed
[1:31:24.720 --> 1:31:32.280]  me yeah he did he was in and out you know and and and he knew he knew that's
[1:31:32.280 --> 1:31:38.040]  what did it yeah God Almighty Ralph who do you blame I mean I would blame Bill
[1:31:38.040 --> 1:31:42.560]  Gates in the media people say oh you know all these famous sports stars that
[1:31:42.560 --> 1:31:46.680]  died they deserved it they went no they did it they said I want to protect people
[1:31:46.680 --> 1:31:50.680]  they were tough guys they did it because they were lied to they were actually
[1:31:50.680 --> 1:31:54.480]  heroes your dad I believe meant well and was a hero at the end of the day but
[1:31:54.480 --> 1:31:58.520]  what about the people that did this on purpose brother yeah Bill Gates and the
[1:31:58.520 --> 1:32:04.680]  globalist and I would love to meet Bill Gates I'll tell you that well brother
[1:32:04.680 --> 1:32:10.280]  how long you've been a listener oh a couple of years couple years yeah well
[1:32:10.280 --> 1:32:14.360]  I spent all my time trying to make sure I'm accurate I make mistakes but I'm when
[1:32:14.360 --> 1:32:17.080]  I came on there and said don't take it it's meant to kill old people I wouldn't
[1:32:17.080 --> 1:32:20.880]  just say that we had the literature but but but what is it like to hear it
[1:32:20.880 --> 1:32:26.840]  versus you actually see it kill your father it was just like you know I
[1:32:26.840 --> 1:32:32.760]  believe this was true and and to actually see it happening it was just it
[1:32:32.760 --> 1:32:38.040]  was awful and all I'm saying is people please don't get this vaccine and and
[1:32:38.040 --> 1:32:42.360]  don't let your parents and and and people that are senior citizens get it
[1:32:42.360 --> 1:32:49.120]  please especially well you notice the British government knew what they got
[1:32:49.120 --> 1:32:52.360]  into and within one week of them doing it three months ago they said do not give
[1:32:52.360 --> 1:32:58.440]  it to above 75 but but still the 75 year olds go and do it it's so sick sir I'm
[1:32:58.440 --> 1:33:04.320]  so sorry for your father but God is real and you know your dad meant well and and
[1:33:04.320 --> 1:33:06.920]  so at the end of the day he did it because he cared about people he was
[1:33:06.920 --> 1:33:10.920]  lied to so you tried your best just use this story to warn others and thank you
[1:33:10.920 --> 1:33:14.480]  for sharing it with us anything else you want to add Ralph that's it Alex thank
[1:33:14.480 --> 1:33:19.760]  you for everything you do I appreciate it thank you brother well and again I'm
[1:33:19.760 --> 1:33:24.080]  not at liberty to talk about this because they get really mad there are two
[1:33:24.080 --> 1:33:27.680]  people in this office right now one of them is about 30 feet from me who lost
[1:33:27.680 --> 1:33:32.560]  children from vaccines and they told him the vaccines killed my grandmother again
[1:33:32.560 --> 1:33:36.400]  got that's vaccinated for polio and and got it they told her she got it from
[1:33:36.400 --> 1:33:41.880]  from from the vaccine in the 1950s and I could go on for an hour I personally
[1:33:41.880 --> 1:33:49.760]  have had my family devastated my father's brother my uncle was in incredible
[1:33:49.760 --> 1:33:53.040]  perfect shape took a tetanus shot almost killed him when he was in high school
[1:33:53.040 --> 1:33:58.000]  and so all I'm telling you is folks this is not what you think it is you think
[1:33:58.000 --> 1:34:04.160]  they just shot up poor black people with syphilis no folks that's that's bad
[1:34:04.160 --> 1:34:09.720]  that's not I'm against that I'm saying it's everybody but they knew when it
[1:34:09.720 --> 1:34:13.520]  started coming out that they just made about black people a lot of elitist
[1:34:13.520 --> 1:34:17.480]  white people would say oh well that's just for them it's very sick and it's
[1:34:17.480 --> 1:34:22.000]  very evil what Christ says what you do to the children you've done to me and
[1:34:22.000 --> 1:34:25.960]  child when Christ said that means somebody under somebody's control an old
[1:34:25.960 --> 1:34:29.960]  person a child a minority being kept poor on a farm somebody that wasn't allowed
[1:34:29.960 --> 1:34:36.280]  to have an education a simple person and what you do to them you've done to me
[1:34:36.280 --> 1:34:41.080]  well that's painful call isn't it folks I got here's people aren't calling it
[1:34:41.080 --> 1:34:48.480]  love it isn't that funny where are they I actually have people I know who had
[1:34:48.480 --> 1:34:51.960]  family members that died from the vaccine the death toll must just be off
[1:34:51.960 --> 1:34:55.600]  the charts and they're they told me Jones y'all you don't talk about it on
[1:34:55.600 --> 1:34:58.800]  air so I won't talk about it that's another thing everybody just kind of
[1:34:58.800 --> 1:35:02.160]  goes in their corner when they kill your family members or they may mean we're
[1:35:02.160 --> 1:35:05.760]  all just don't want to make a big deal about it because we're not the leftist
[1:35:05.760 --> 1:35:13.520]  that are the drama queens God Almighty let's just take another call who's been
[1:35:13.520 --> 1:35:21.440]  holding the longest now here let's go ahead and talk to Ken in California Ken
[1:35:21.440 --> 1:35:27.280]  thanks for holding go ahead hey Alex good good talking to you I work in a in a
[1:35:27.280 --> 1:35:33.120]  hospital and they were offering the vaccines I a nurse had just taken it I
[1:35:33.120 --> 1:35:36.360]  mean I was gonna decline I had already declined to begin with but a nurse
[1:35:36.360 --> 1:35:40.960]  before me had taken it and I witnessed her after she received it passed out
[1:35:40.960 --> 1:35:46.360]  three times had to be escorted out to her vehicle so like I said you know I
[1:35:46.360 --> 1:35:51.080]  go I I wasn't gonna take to begin with and after watching that I definitely not
[1:35:51.080 --> 1:35:55.560]  gonna take it but I also have a wife who's a medical doctor and we're both
[1:35:55.560 --> 1:36:00.200]  back and forth you know I've been against it from the beginning actually
[1:36:00.200 --> 1:36:04.760]  let her listen a little bit to when you were speaking about the mRNA and I
[1:36:04.760 --> 1:36:09.520]  kind of that got her just to switch and not take it right now as she says she's
[1:36:09.520 --> 1:36:13.320]  waiting for the others to come out but I am well I totally agree what you just
[1:36:13.320 --> 1:36:19.640]  said I'm not saying take the viral vector AstraZeneca or Johnson Johnson but
[1:36:19.640 --> 1:36:24.240]  but but those aren't killing as many people as the Moderna and as the Pfizer
[1:36:24.240 --> 1:36:28.640]  that to notice they're saying don't take these take these I wouldn't take any of
[1:36:28.640 --> 1:36:31.640]  them but I sure as hell wouldn't take what they're telling me Bill Gates is
[1:36:31.640 --> 1:36:40.120]  involved in the mRNA vaccines the color earlier the fellow whose father died in
[1:36:40.120 --> 1:36:43.760]  Knoxville see if he can call back in asking what vaccine his father took I
[1:36:43.760 --> 1:36:46.880]  know we've got lines open here because people are being nice and I call them
[1:36:46.880 --> 1:36:50.680]  they're not up on the subject see if that gentleman can call back in because I
[1:36:50.680 --> 1:36:55.880]  want to know which vaccine killed his papa sorry go ahead Ken
[1:36:55.880 --> 1:37:00.440]  no I've just said I definitely you know I'm not going to take any in and when
[1:37:00.440 --> 1:37:05.120]  people do pass or expire from you know the the vaccine it's not it's not put
[1:37:05.120 --> 1:37:08.000]  out there you know we hear it I hear it at the hospital because of the nurses
[1:37:08.000 --> 1:37:11.240]  speak and our doctors speak to other workers and other hospitals and say
[1:37:11.240 --> 1:37:14.360]  this person just died well that's my question what is the chatter there in
[1:37:14.360 --> 1:37:18.440]  the hospital I mean wow because I mean you're here in this everywhere well I'm
[1:37:18.440 --> 1:37:23.440]  you know we're in California so we have we have the virtual signalers you know
[1:37:23.440 --> 1:37:26.560]  the ones the ones are going to take it I actually got into shouting national
[1:37:26.560 --> 1:37:31.800]  winners and she told me you can go ahead die I hope die or something that you
[1:37:31.800 --> 1:37:37.480]  know so it's 50 50 half I'm not going to take it to the half or just happy and
[1:37:37.480 --> 1:37:41.200]  willing to take it how many reports on average of adverse reactions or death are
[1:37:41.200 --> 1:37:49.360]  you hearing on average it's being hushed so you know I hear a lot of reports
[1:37:49.360 --> 1:37:54.400]  getting really sick by the death you don't really find out afterwards when
[1:37:54.400 --> 1:37:58.080]  somebody says somebody died sure and they don't say they died of it well you're
[1:37:58.080 --> 1:38:00.800]  a lot of these old folks are dying well I guess there's too many of them it's

[1:43:31.240 --> 1:43:36.280]  circuits like three ways and then one day I kept dreaming of a world I thought
[1:43:36.280 --> 1:43:47.040]  I'd never see and then one day one day I got in
[1:43:47.480 --> 1:43:53.880]  you found out it was a off-world demonic interspatial attack bring down the
[1:43:53.880 --> 1:43:59.080]  species and the collaborators were working with Satan against God's plan
[1:43:59.080 --> 1:44:07.920]  bring us down one day I got it when you come at it from that perspective it all
[1:44:07.920 --> 1:44:16.360]  makes sense you understand it all and the enemy finally respects you and just
[1:44:16.360 --> 1:44:21.120]  see you as an enemy soldier instead of a fool
[1:44:21.800 --> 1:44:27.080]  they don't laugh we talk about that they look back at us and say that's right we
[1:44:27.080 --> 1:44:33.400]  chose the winner you're gonna lose God in the devil it's as real as a heart attack
[1:44:33.400 --> 1:44:36.920]  all right we're taking your phone calls retired police officer sergeant in
[1:44:36.920 --> 1:44:41.400]  Arizona Jeremy Mississippi Matthew at Texas Janelle in Kansas Paul Texas
[1:44:41.400 --> 1:44:45.440]  everybody everybody in the order they came in let's go to Janelle in Kansas
[1:44:45.440 --> 1:44:51.400]  tell us your vaccine story please thanks for calling I guess I have a former
[1:44:51.400 --> 1:44:57.960]  employee that was he retired now but he took the first shot and within two days
[1:44:57.960 --> 1:45:03.920]  he was hospitalized with a stroke and so my question is is there anything that
[1:45:03.920 --> 1:45:09.600]  you could tell us to do you know maybe some of your supplements or something
[1:45:09.600 --> 1:45:13.840]  that he can do now that he's taken the first shot I don't he's still in limbo
[1:45:13.840 --> 1:45:18.760]  if he's taken the second one so hopefully this will help but he doesn't
[1:45:18.760 --> 1:45:23.320]  know if he's gonna take the second one right right well this sounds like the
[1:45:23.320 --> 1:45:28.320]  Darwin Awards to me you know it's an IQ test I mean are these people are so
[1:45:28.320 --> 1:45:33.520]  trusting you can show him literature okay what what so-called vaccine did he
[1:45:33.520 --> 1:45:39.080]  take was it a virus vector vaccine was it the the Azra Zeneca or was it the
[1:45:39.080 --> 1:45:45.760]  Johnson and Johnson or was it an mRNA vaccine I I don't know I haven't asked
[1:45:45.760 --> 1:45:54.120]  him that question okay so how close are you to this person I'm pretty close I
[1:45:54.120 --> 1:45:58.640]  mean he's a very good friend of our family still well I would just tell him
[1:45:58.640 --> 1:46:02.520]  if he wants to be depopulated take the next shot I mean he had a stroke and he
[1:46:02.520 --> 1:46:11.360]  is he tying it to the vaccine I I don't know I can say that he was very healthy
[1:46:11.360 --> 1:46:18.360]  before no medical problems he's in his early I think he's maybe 70 he hasn't
[1:46:18.360 --> 1:46:22.440]  worked for us for a couple years but listen you tell me tell him you're not
[1:46:22.440 --> 1:46:26.280]  gonna be collecting so security and stuff that's good and tell him take the
[1:46:26.280 --> 1:46:29.920]  second shot and leave the planet because here's the deal a lot of these folks
[1:46:29.920 --> 1:46:32.880]  are real they're like in this hero mode and they don't want to admit they got
[1:46:32.880 --> 1:46:36.400]  con because you'll have to admit that this is bad so they'll probably take the
[1:46:36.400 --> 1:46:41.000]  next shot and probably die and so just say hey when you're dying will you at
[1:46:41.000 --> 1:46:45.000]  least shoot a video to warn others and I'm not being sarcastic here I'm so
[1:46:45.000 --> 1:46:48.080]  sorry about your family friend it's just that you can lead a horse to water you
[1:46:48.080 --> 1:46:55.040]  can't make him drink absolutely wow well please find out what vaccine he took so
[1:46:55.040 --> 1:46:58.160]  we can warn people and I appreciate your point anything else you'd like to say
[1:46:58.160 --> 1:47:03.560]  you know no that'll be it thank you very much yeah and listen I care about my
[1:47:03.560 --> 1:47:07.120]  family and I and I and I'm sitting there like preach at the dinner table last
[1:47:07.120 --> 1:47:10.360]  night where my brother-in-law's father got paralyzed from and he's a medical
[1:47:10.360 --> 1:47:16.000]  doctor and it's it's like Ben Stein's like well I glad I took it you know it
[1:47:16.000 --> 1:47:20.800]  almost killed me what for something that kills like point zero zero zero percent
[1:47:20.800 --> 1:47:25.040]  it's all a fraud but we're they know though people ask why the Germans went
[1:47:25.040 --> 1:47:28.800]  along with Hitler once he got them into a war they were stuck folks you got to
[1:47:28.800 --> 1:47:35.920]  say no up front we're being suckered into this thing man God almighty this is
[1:47:35.920 --> 1:47:40.800]  sick okay up next would be Matt in Michigan Matt welcome you're on the
[1:47:40.800 --> 1:47:51.480]  air yes sir so my dad is a medical doctor and he had the second round of the
[1:47:51.480 --> 1:47:57.000]  vaccine and now he just received word that his PSA levels in his prostate are
[1:47:57.000 --> 1:48:03.160]  high which like you know obviously are an indication of potential cancer so now
[1:48:03.160 --> 1:48:07.480]  he has to have a biopsy on his prostate well they actually said that sir they
[1:48:07.480 --> 1:48:12.680]  said when you so did he take the Pfizer or Moderna I want to say Pfizer but I'm
[1:48:12.680 --> 1:48:15.880]  not a hundred percent sure on that yeah it's the mRNA that anything that's
[1:48:15.880 --> 1:48:19.680]  already pre-cancerous makes it basically go cancerous they admit that
[1:48:19.680 --> 1:48:24.840]  wow so now they want to biopsy of his prostate can he show them the
[1:48:24.840 --> 1:48:29.440]  literature saying that it makes hormone-based tissues swell up and that
[1:48:29.440 --> 1:48:35.400]  they should not do any by top biopsies for six months oh I guess I was not
[1:48:35.400 --> 1:48:39.480]  aware of that I mean I've tried to send up videos and stuff he just he doesn't
[1:48:39.480 --> 1:48:45.880]  want to type in a doctor say don't be alarmed after mRNA vaccine if your
[1:48:45.880 --> 1:48:53.520]  glands uterus prostate swell up yeah that's that's what it does sir okay but
[1:48:53.520 --> 1:48:56.680]  notice they don't tell him that they're gonna make more money off the illness
[1:48:56.680 --> 1:49:01.680]  they've now given him exactly so what is your dad now saying about taking the
[1:49:01.680 --> 1:49:08.840]  shot not much I think he still I think he still agrees with that I don't I don't
[1:49:08.840 --> 1:49:12.820]  even know if he's put two and two together that it's that it's from the
[1:49:12.820 --> 1:49:15.760]  vibe you know from the vaccine yeah because if you try to talk about it on
[1:49:15.760 --> 1:49:19.160]  Facebook Twitter YouTube they block you I mean you can be a medical doctor you can
[1:49:19.160 --> 1:49:22.600]  have the scientific reports they will not warn the people doesn't that make them
[1:49:22.600 --> 1:49:27.160]  aiding and abetting this sir absolutely yeah there's somebody need to pay for all
[1:49:27.160 --> 1:49:31.600]  this and it's ridiculous that they're not God bless you call me back again and
[1:49:31.600 --> 1:49:33.920]  I'm not cutting these colors short I want to get to everybody you're amazing

[1:50:43.600 --> 1:50:47.640]  are sick and you'd think people would put that together you know two and two but
[1:50:47.640 --> 1:50:54.520]  it just never happens they now I've tried to warn my family half my family's
[1:50:54.520 --> 1:51:01.080]  done run down and got this injection you know they got the National Guard set up
[1:51:01.080 --> 1:51:04.800]  over here in one town where they can go over and they just they even built a
[1:51:04.800 --> 1:51:09.840]  new road for them to get in to get this shot in your car and they're just
[1:51:09.840 --> 1:51:16.000]  flocking over there man just flocking over there to get it where do you think
[1:51:16.000 --> 1:51:19.680]  this is all gonna go how are they gonna cover up all the illnesses and deaths
[1:51:19.680 --> 1:51:24.480]  man I don't know that's one thing and I've just noticed it's really just got
[1:51:24.480 --> 1:51:29.640]  heavy the last several weeks I'm not I haven't noticed anything yet other than
[1:51:29.640 --> 1:51:37.280]  some localized stuff my stepmother and father got it she's having a problem on
[1:51:37.280 --> 1:51:44.440]  her arm I mean they won't go away but uh you know I don't know I don't know man
[1:51:44.440 --> 1:51:48.240]  and then you know just like this whole COVID they're such liars man my wife
[1:51:48.240 --> 1:51:51.840]  lost my wife last year because I couldn't really get her proper medical
[1:51:51.840 --> 1:51:56.640]  attention genetic she had a genetic condition and had and she had real
[1:51:56.640 --> 1:52:02.160]  bad at COPD and they she would you would not go to the hospital because they
[1:52:02.160 --> 1:52:05.240]  wouldn't let me stay with her she wouldn't she would not stay oh yeah
[1:52:05.240 --> 1:52:07.960]  that's the whole thing not let you go because the COVID so they can run a
[1:52:07.960 --> 1:52:11.440]  dictatorship inside there that's right and I knew and I wasn't gonna let her
[1:52:11.440 --> 1:52:16.120]  stay without me because I knew if they got her in there with her condition she
[1:52:16.120 --> 1:52:19.920]  was probably done for well they would have done a fake PCR test and
[1:52:19.920 --> 1:52:25.320]  innovated her for the money yep I know and I saw any anyway basically we just
[1:52:25.320 --> 1:52:30.280]  said at home till she died and you know I mean she was but she was sick man but I
[1:52:30.280 --> 1:52:35.000]  you know I do think I think in the normal circumstances she she would have lived

[1:54:48.600 --> 1:54:56.840]  called Wayne's World. Even before I had an access to a show in the mid-90s I
[1:54:56.840 --> 1:55:01.680]  went and saw that movie and thought man that was fun. Talk to speak out have your
[1:55:01.680 --> 1:55:04.680]  own ideas and even if you're a nerd you're still entertaining because you're
[1:55:04.680 --> 1:55:12.840]  real. Well what do they say in Wayne's World. Every day when I cover these huge
[1:55:12.840 --> 1:55:16.600]  topics I don't feel worthy to talk to you because these topics are so huge or so
[1:55:16.600 --> 1:55:19.640]  real but I'm trying to tell you the truth I'm trying to get it right and most
[1:55:19.640 --> 1:55:23.400]  the time we do. The globalists love lying to you they love manipulating you
[1:55:23.400 --> 1:55:29.400]  they enjoy destroying humanity they enjoy manipulating ideas and using
[1:55:29.400 --> 1:55:33.720]  people's ignorance against them. That for me is really set down and disgusting.
[1:55:33.720 --> 1:55:38.440]  So you've got to pledge for myself and the whole info wars crew that we will
[1:55:38.440 --> 1:55:42.480]  never join the globalists we will never knowingly manipulate you because we
[1:55:42.480 --> 1:55:47.480]  know we're all in this together.
[1:55:47.480 --> 1:55:52.480]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:55:58.480 --> 1:56:02.480]  Alright I'm moving quick here to get to all the calls for the next 15 minutes.
[1:56:02.480 --> 1:56:09.480]  Bill, the entire police officer, Matt, Sean, Paul, Jim, Steve and Kelly. Amazing. We should do whole shows just taking calls from people
[1:56:09.480 --> 1:56:13.120]  talking about what happened and I miss what the caller said Ralph from Tennessee
[1:56:13.120 --> 1:56:16.320]  his father died I was taking the Moderna vaccine the crew went back and
[1:56:16.320 --> 1:56:20.920]  listened to that just heart-wrenching stuff. Okay let's go to the next caller
[1:56:20.920 --> 1:56:25.480]  let's talk to Matthew and then Paul Matthew and Texas thanks for calling ER
[1:56:25.480 --> 1:56:30.880]  Tech medical worker your view go ahead. Oh my god Alex it's an honor to talk to you
[1:56:30.880 --> 1:56:35.560]  10-year listener first-time caller yeah I'm a ER technician and I have a degree
[1:56:35.560 --> 1:56:39.360]  in human biology also a pre-med student and a national guardsman that just
[1:56:39.360 --> 1:56:44.520]  got back from DC working in the hospital again and I want to talk to you about
[1:56:44.520 --> 1:56:48.880]  crazy things I'm seeing the lies that they're blatantly telling us and more
[1:56:48.880 --> 1:56:54.080]  importantly there's 200 plus soldiers at Fort Campbell Kentucky right now that
[1:56:54.080 --> 1:56:58.600]  are being punished they're being threatened they're not being allowed to
[1:56:58.600 --> 1:57:02.360]  go home and see their families because they're refusing to take the vaccine and
[1:57:02.360 --> 1:57:05.680]  they begged me last night to call you and tell you about this to give you the
[1:57:05.680 --> 1:57:09.360]  details on that. Well please sir tell us about the Fort Campbell Kentucky thing
[1:57:09.360 --> 1:57:14.080]  first and then tell us about what you're witnessing. Okay so my brother is active
[1:57:14.080 --> 1:57:18.400]  duty in the Army like I said I'm also a national guardsman but right now they're
[1:57:18.400 --> 1:57:22.720]  saying it's optional to take the vaccine but by July they're gonna make it
[1:57:22.720 --> 1:57:27.920]  mandatory and if they don't take it right now though even though it's optional
[1:57:27.920 --> 1:57:32.000]  they're not being allowed to leave 25 miles from the base if they live 26
[1:57:32.000 --> 1:57:35.720]  miles they can't go home and see their family. My brother is not allowed to go
[1:57:35.720 --> 1:57:40.280]  to work he is forced every day they send them into rooms with high ranking
[1:57:40.280 --> 1:57:44.760]  officers with first sergeant sergeant majors that grill them ask them why
[1:57:44.760 --> 1:57:47.680]  they're not going to take it and say hey well if you don't take it now when
[1:57:47.680 --> 1:57:50.800]  July comes if you don't take it everyone that doesn't take it to be
[1:57:50.800 --> 1:57:54.560]  busted down to a private you're gonna have to forfeit pay we're gonna give you
[1:57:54.560 --> 1:58:00.840]  article 15's you're gonna have extra duty you're gonna be on restriction and so
[1:58:00.840 --> 1:58:04.880]  right now there's guys haven't lived in the COVID barracks with supposedly six
[1:58:04.880 --> 1:58:07.680]  soldiers I'm yet to see and again whatever they're doing the troops is us
[1:58:07.680 --> 1:58:10.920]  next just they want to get all the sheep to take it first so when sheep still get
[1:58:10.920 --> 1:58:14.400]  sick they'll say those of us that didn't take it it's our fault and so the
[1:58:14.400 --> 1:58:17.160]  military is a beta test we got to stand with them this is an experimental
[1:58:17.160 --> 1:58:22.120]  vaccine just like the anthrax shots got suspended we need Congress to take action
[1:58:22.120 --> 1:58:24.920]  please continue and and that's exactly what they're telling them they're
[1:58:24.920 --> 1:58:27.080]  questioning soldiers saying well why don't you want to take it they're
[1:58:27.080 --> 1:58:30.600]  saying well because it's experimental we know that they're using fetal tissue
[1:58:30.600 --> 1:58:33.960]  in it and that's against our religion they're saying they don't care because at
[1:58:33.960 --> 1:58:37.680]  the same time they're going after extremism supposedly which now it's
[1:58:37.680 --> 1:58:41.720]  extreme to be a Christian they're going after oh yeah CNN says not wanting to take
[1:58:41.720 --> 1:58:44.640]  the shot as another sign of white supremacism this is totally insane
[1:58:44.640 --> 1:58:48.400]  hey don't worry Hank Aaron and Marbles Marvin Hagler they're not white
[1:58:48.400 --> 1:58:52.120]  supremacists they're dead so they're they're trying to give them the Pfizer
[1:58:52.120 --> 1:58:56.840]  vaccine and we have over 200 just at four Campbell with third brigade they're
[1:58:56.840 --> 1:59:03.560]  saying they don't want to take it they all fake shot they shoot it out on the
[1:59:03.560 --> 1:59:06.800]  wall they shoot it in a trash can I can tell you all the medical doctors I know
[1:59:06.800 --> 1:59:12.960]  they none of them take it hardly any of them do it and then also another thing
[1:59:12.960 --> 1:59:16.440]  that not COVID related but he was saying that they're also starting to try to
[1:59:16.440 --> 1:59:20.560]  implement ammo restriction on soldiers that their personal own firearms they're
[1:59:20.560 --> 1:59:24.400]  not allowed to own over a certain amount of ammo or else they're going to be in
[1:59:24.400 --> 1:59:29.560]  trouble with the MPs for extremism as well but that's a little off topic oh
[1:59:29.560 --> 1:59:34.360]  yeah they're absolutely trying to purge our military put globalist in well is
[1:59:34.360 --> 1:59:37.320]  this happening the opposite effect I mean I mean did the military people
[1:59:37.320 --> 1:59:41.680]  realize this is a globalist takeover they do especially in the combat arms
[1:59:41.680 --> 1:59:45.880]  side I don't know a single infantry soldier that isn't aware of what's
[1:59:45.880 --> 1:59:50.120]  going on that doesn't listen to you and listen to others pretty much my entire
[1:59:50.120 --> 1:59:52.760]  unit is getting out of the army in the next year because they don't want to
[1:59:52.760 --> 1:59:57.560]  deal with this like that I just got back from DC as well and all of us were just
[1:59:57.560 --> 2:00:00.840]  sticking to be there the FBI would go through our hotel rooms as soon as we
[2:00:00.840 --> 2:00:05.240]  walked out to go out on the streets in patrol we were being stepped over by the
[2:00:05.240 --> 2:00:09.480]  congressmen and just treated like this is a foreign takeover this is a foreign
[2:00:09.480 --> 2:00:15.360]  takeover this is oh we're pretty much feeling like a lot of the very high up
[2:00:15.360 --> 2:00:19.800]  ranking people are not working for our country at this point and I think a lot
[2:00:19.800 --> 2:00:23.440]  of us are just at the point that we're wanting to get out and I understand if
[2:00:23.440 --> 2:00:26.560]  I was you I'd probably get out but you understand then this is meant to get you
[2:00:26.560 --> 2:00:29.560]  out then they'll have pure communist in but I guess that's okay that'll get the
[2:00:29.560 --> 2:00:34.680]  battle lines drawn yeah don't hang up I know I said I would go along with the
[2:00:34.680 --> 2:00:38.840]  caller but I want to hear you briefly say what you're seeing as an EMT or an ER
[2:00:38.840 --> 2:00:42.840]  with the vaccine with all these other amazing callers straight ahead back in
[2:00:42.840 --> 2:00:51.560]  60 seconds
[2:00:51.560 --> 2:00:57.080]  I've been thinking a lot lately about playing devil's advocate on there about
[2:00:57.080 --> 2:01:00.440]  looking at the world from the perspective of the globalist that the public's so
[2:01:00.440 --> 2:01:03.440]  dumbed down that they don't care that we're stealing their future from them
[2:01:03.440 --> 2:01:07.080]  that we're poisoning them that we're sterilizing them then they deserve to be
[2:01:07.080 --> 2:01:11.800]  killed yes that's the position of the globalist they play God and they think
[2:01:11.800 --> 2:01:16.360]  because we don't stand up they have a right to do this to us you know I've
[2:01:16.360 --> 2:01:19.920]  told you that the globalist who tried to harm me they try to get me to join them
[2:01:19.920 --> 2:01:25.360]  but metaphysically at a spiritual level I have the Holy Spirit I'm connection
[2:01:25.360 --> 2:01:30.120]  God's and I know that God is not like that so I cannot join the enemy but I'll
[2:01:30.120 --> 2:01:34.560]  tell you at a selfish level I get very very mad at people to go along with the
[2:01:34.560 --> 2:01:38.880]  system believing you're part of it or believing you're getting power whether
[2:01:38.880 --> 2:01:43.000]  you're just a steelworker or schoolteacher or Henry Kissinger you're
[2:01:43.000 --> 2:01:48.160]  not God and treating other people like they're animals and your God is
[2:01:48.160 --> 2:02:09.320]  something that the real God of the universe doesn't like that's a fact well
[2:02:09.320 --> 2:02:13.920]  the big takeaway from the caller Matthew in Texas is the Pentagon has told the
[2:02:13.920 --> 2:02:18.560]  troops at Fort Campbell Kentucky that in July the vaccines will become mandatory
[2:02:18.560 --> 2:02:23.520]  they're not letting them basically go see their families or go further than 25
[2:02:23.520 --> 2:02:26.640]  miles off base they don't submit that's already happening at colleges where you
[2:02:26.640 --> 2:02:30.000]  can't leave the college for a semester if you haven't the vaccine it's all
[2:02:30.000 --> 2:02:34.240]  prison training for the force inoculation for the illegal medical
[2:02:34.240 --> 2:02:38.720]  experimentation with the tracking systems in the world ID the communist Chinese
[2:02:38.720 --> 2:02:42.920]  social credit score and the purge of our military but he's also not just a
[2:02:42.920 --> 2:02:46.760]  National Guardsman just got back from DC Matthew was talking about being an ER tech
[2:02:46.760 --> 2:02:50.560]  and what he's witnessing with these deadly gene therapy so what are you
[2:02:50.560 --> 2:02:57.320]  seeing well so first off early on in the middle of COVID I was blatantly seeing
[2:02:57.320 --> 2:03:02.200]  the hospital by about the cause of death for multiple patients I had a patient
[2:03:02.200 --> 2:03:05.560]  who was a repeat patient I would come in all the time who was in liver failure
[2:03:05.560 --> 2:03:09.400]  they died later you know we went to just look at the chart and say I wonder
[2:03:09.400 --> 2:03:13.160]  what happened to them when they went to the ICU and then it's that caused death
[2:03:13.160 --> 2:03:17.400]  in the business department was the one changing these deaths because they wanted
[2:03:17.400 --> 2:03:23.520]  to get the money from the CARES Act grant for all the people that died I know
[2:03:23.520 --> 2:03:27.080]  people that are getting the vaccine there's some that have had no effect we've
[2:03:27.080 --> 2:03:29.840]  had a lot of nurses and a lot of doctors that are out sick we had a
[2:03:29.840 --> 2:03:34.880]  cardiologist who was out for over a week sick is all heck and had to cancel
[2:03:34.880 --> 2:03:39.800]  weeks worth of surgeries they're still trying to cancel surgeries because some
[2:03:39.800 --> 2:03:43.120]  of the doctors that are you know deep into the conditioning are saying hey
[2:03:43.120 --> 2:03:47.040]  it's too dangerous even let a person come into the hospital now they're going
[2:03:47.040 --> 2:03:51.360]  to get COVID and die if they come here to even get a surgery in our safe
[2:03:51.360 --> 2:03:55.920]  environment like the last caller said that was a nurse I'm yet to see a person
[2:03:55.920 --> 2:04:00.680]  who's actually even sick of COVID itself though I we had a COVID floor that was
[2:04:00.680 --> 2:04:04.080]  full of COVID positive people none of them seem like they had anything worse
[2:04:04.080 --> 2:04:08.720]  than a typical flu or a bad cold I've had patients I had a patient last night
[2:04:08.720 --> 2:04:14.800]  come in who's 25 she just got over COVID and I said well were you sick when you
[2:04:14.800 --> 2:04:17.640]  had it or was it kind of like a cold to the flu she said yeah it was just like a
[2:04:17.640 --> 2:04:20.640]  cold but now that she's received the vaccine she's having symptoms of
[2:04:20.640 --> 2:04:28.920]  meningitis and since they've lowered the threshold on the tests of what
[2:04:28.920 --> 2:04:34.000]  qualifies as a positive we've now gone from 97 patients in the hospital that
[2:04:34.000 --> 2:04:38.280]  were COVID positive to only 20 which is really curious what that happens after
[2:04:38.280 --> 2:04:42.040]  Biden comes into office that's right as technocrats they can turn the level up
[2:04:42.040 --> 2:04:44.720]  and turn it down whenever they want oh you've got a lot of other great points
[2:04:44.720 --> 2:04:47.840]  to make we got to jump the next person God bless you we're probably just gonna
[2:04:47.840 --> 2:04:50.040]  open the phones up again for the whole week to people like you because the
[2:04:50.040 --> 2:04:54.520]  people need to hear the real world and this reality will end the gaslighting
[2:04:54.520 --> 2:04:56.680]  but I got to get to everybody because everybody's holding thank you sir God
[2:04:56.680 --> 2:05:00.280]  bless you I'll say hi all the folks at Fort Campbell Kentucky there at the
[2:05:00.280 --> 2:05:05.680]  night stalkers okay let's go ahead and take another call here let's go to Kelly
[2:05:05.680 --> 2:05:10.040]  in Arizona friend is a firefighter firefighter Union most refusing that's
[2:05:10.040 --> 2:05:15.200]  in the news that's good news Kelly give us your take on that well it's yeah a
[2:05:15.200 --> 2:05:18.560]  good friend of mine he works for one of the smaller departments just outside of
[2:05:18.560 --> 2:05:22.200]  the greater Phoenix they had a union meeting to get them all to come in to
[2:05:22.200 --> 2:05:28.000]  vaccinate and there's a little over 700 not Union only seven of them took that
[2:05:28.000 --> 2:05:33.480]  back in the fire department well they're gonna be trying to push it on people the
[2:05:33.480 --> 2:05:38.560]  answer is don't just refuse it warn everybody you know do you agree with me
[2:05:39.160 --> 2:05:43.520]  all right we lost that caller retired police sergeant in Arizona wants to

[2:05:52.720 --> 2:05:57.560]  patronizing you I could go on for hours sir anyway I'm a Christian man I was a
[2:05:57.560 --> 2:06:02.560]  law enforcement for 23 years and we actually moved from Arizona to Texas
[2:06:02.560 --> 2:06:07.880]  and found a great house big pool everything you know really thought that
[2:06:07.880 --> 2:06:13.320]  we were getting out of all this and this governor that runs that state my heart
[2:06:13.320 --> 2:06:16.840]  is just broke we're actually yeah Abbott just came out and said they're
[2:06:16.840 --> 2:06:20.560]  gonna shut down gab that's I was gonna he called it white supremacist even it
[2:06:20.560 --> 2:06:23.240]  was white supremacist it has a right to exist but it's not it's the opposite of
[2:06:23.240 --> 2:06:27.520]  that it's absolutely outrageous our governor is a dirtbag this guy is
[2:06:27.520 --> 2:06:31.040]  compromised by China I don't know if anyone's seen the john's fabric report
[2:06:31.040 --> 2:06:36.120]  he had a report of 29 governors who were compromised by China who have
[2:06:36.120 --> 2:06:40.600]  accepted money tourism blah blah blah our own governor Abbott is on there I'm
[2:06:40.600 --> 2:06:44.680]  moving back to Arizona because of this man not that do sees any better but I
[2:06:44.680 --> 2:06:50.080]  found myself a great county to live in that's very red and I feel safe there and
[2:06:50.080 --> 2:06:54.000]  that's listen I love Texas but it is Texans better wake up to how much
[2:06:54.000 --> 2:06:57.720]  trouble around and it's only the cities that are run by Democrats but yeah the
[2:06:57.720 --> 2:07:00.320]  governor the governor is a piece of work what's your take on the vaccine
[2:07:00.320 --> 2:07:06.400]  policies I'm not taking it and the real reason that I called Alex is I have a
[2:07:06.400 --> 2:07:12.200]  son that's a he's a baseball player in college he's a d1 athlete only a
[2:07:12.200 --> 2:07:17.200]  freshman and I'm scared to death that they're gonna make these kids these
[2:07:17.200 --> 2:07:21.280]  athletes that don't need nothing he's already had COVID and they got to
[2:07:21.280 --> 2:07:25.320]  organize now ahead of it you got to get he's got to organize ahead of it create
[2:07:25.320 --> 2:07:29.440]  a union and be nice to the coaches but say hey talk about the deaths educate
[2:07:29.440 --> 2:07:33.000]  people now so there's resistance ahead of it don't wait till they move against
[2:07:33.000 --> 2:07:38.480]  them Alex we're talking about division one athletes we cannot get these kids
[2:07:38.480 --> 2:07:42.400]  injected with something that they don't need and I'm afraid they're gonna do this
[2:07:42.400 --> 2:07:45.880]  by getting them with the facts mean passport they're gonna make them fly
[2:07:45.880 --> 2:07:49.960]  bring them it you know to travel to see exactly there's always gonna be loopholes
[2:07:49.960 --> 2:07:52.480]  because the globalists aren't going to be taking it I got a jump great points
[2:07:52.480 --> 2:07:56.160]  that's a whole nother debate thank you okay up next here I'm just moving fast
[2:07:56.160 --> 2:08:00.160]  get everybody in here that would be Paul in Texas father took the vaccine

[2:08:15.860 --> 2:08:20.600]  to is a vaccine did you know what type he took no I don't that's one thing
[2:08:20.600 --> 2:08:26.000]  everyone tried to my my sister's a VA nurse and she called him and spoke with
[2:08:26.000 --> 2:08:30.800]  him on the phone for hours about not taking this thing she says that all the
[2:08:30.800 --> 2:08:35.040]  doctors up there and all the nurses where she works in Texas aren't touching
[2:08:35.040 --> 2:08:40.440]  it they don't like any of them so well that's so a VA nurse called your father

[2:10:11.720 --> 2:10:19.560]  for taking my call thing with the vaccine here my wife she's taken both of the
[2:10:19.560 --> 2:10:26.040]  Pfizer shots I refuse to take any of it and her daughter pushed her into doing
[2:10:26.040 --> 2:10:30.360]  this because she said it's the right thing to do my baby or not to take it
[2:10:30.360 --> 2:10:35.080]  and then all the peer pressure from her friends well we're taking it we're
[2:10:35.080 --> 2:10:44.440]  taking it and you know I can see it's affecting her already what is it done
[2:10:44.440 --> 2:10:51.120]  to her sir well she kind of has had a little I don't even want to say dementia
[2:10:51.120 --> 2:10:55.760]  but she's you know we're both getting up in these causes brain fog it causes the
[2:10:55.760 --> 2:10:59.240]  beginning yeah it causes a protein bloom in the brain must have been the mRNA do
[2:10:59.240 --> 2:11:05.480]  you know what she took yeah she took the Pfizer vaccine and when I seen the when
[2:11:05.480 --> 2:11:13.760]  you interviewed Dr. Tim I said oh my god it's it's gonna be hacker from alone and
[2:11:13.760 --> 2:11:17.800]  it's gonna destroy her well there are I'm not a medical doctor but I'm gonna
[2:11:17.800 --> 2:11:20.760]  have ten penny on and others talk about there are detoxes there are anti
[2:11:20.760 --> 2:11:24.480]  inflammation things a lot of times simple benadryl the doctors won't tell you
[2:11:24.480 --> 2:11:29.560]  that or I'm not giving medical advice but but oral steroids a steroid shot from
[2:11:29.560 --> 2:11:32.680]  the doctor you'll have to go in and say oh I got an allergy give me a steroid
[2:11:32.680 --> 2:11:35.800]  shot that could really help her because it's an autoimmune response a lot of
[2:11:35.800 --> 2:11:39.520]  times and I'm not a doctor I know what they say is going on though because the
[2:11:39.520 --> 2:11:44.080]  brain fog is a swelling in the brain a lot of times and a bloom of protein but
[2:11:44.080 --> 2:11:48.240]  but a lot of times if you reverse the inflammation it can help not a time
[2:11:48.240 --> 2:11:53.680]  God bless you stay with us you know it's crazy to get to this point it's very

[2:14:10.040 --> 2:14:15.160]  you just saw Tucker Carlson last week embroiled with the Pentagon
[2:14:15.160 --> 2:14:19.360]  investigating him and speaking out against him for daring the question
[2:14:19.360 --> 2:14:23.600]  putting pregnant women in combat and giving him maternity suits for the
[2:14:23.600 --> 2:14:29.080]  fighter pilots and in having the military wear red high heels and to have
[2:14:29.080 --> 2:14:34.040]  you know I guess put the transgender people in Delta Wars or whatever's
[2:14:34.040 --> 2:14:38.360]  going on you're not supposed to have your military investigating civilians or
[2:14:38.360 --> 2:14:42.040]  the media that's called tyranny you know like when the CIA got caught spying on
[2:14:42.040 --> 2:14:47.240]  Congress but what of your Ezra Levant of rebel media he's had a big national
[2:14:47.240 --> 2:14:50.720]  talk show they've been the big national network very successful it was a lot of
[2:14:50.720 --> 2:14:53.720]  great work well he just discovered we'll have the actual documents we're
[2:14:53.720 --> 2:14:58.360]  breaking them all here today the Justin Trudeau the same guy that said that he
[2:14:58.360 --> 2:15:01.400]  basically pledged allegiance to the communist dictatorship and admires
[2:15:01.400 --> 2:15:06.800]  quote dictatorship hired a US defense contractor to spy on rebel news here's
[2:15:06.800 --> 2:15:09.240]  Tucker Carlson talking about what happened to him then we'll talk to Ezra
[2:15:09.240 --> 2:15:14.600]  your politicians like Tammy Duckworth say that it's unpatriotic to question the
[2:15:14.600 --> 2:15:18.240]  Pentagon unless you have served in the military yourself you haven't earned
[2:15:18.240 --> 2:15:24.240]  that right really can only cops talk about police brutality if you haven't
[2:15:24.240 --> 2:15:28.920]  been elected to office or you're allowed to criticize Congress they're not
[2:15:28.920 --> 2:15:33.000]  making a real argument they're trying to silence dissent not playing along
[2:15:33.000 --> 2:15:39.160]  sorry every American citizen has a right maybe an obligation to know what the
[2:15:39.160 --> 2:15:44.440]  military they pay for is doing because our lives may depend on it today the
[2:15:44.440 --> 2:15:47.800]  Department of Defense launched a large and coordinated public relations
[2:15:47.800 --> 2:15:52.640]  offensive against this show Pentagon brass issued hostile statements people in
[2:15:52.640 --> 2:15:58.200]  uniforms set out videos on social media the DOD even issued a news release
[2:15:58.200 --> 2:16:05.280]  attacking us press secretary smites Fox News host smites like we're a hostile
[2:16:05.280 --> 2:16:09.440]  foreign power we suspect this is one where they might actually win they've
[2:16:09.440 --> 2:16:13.800]  got a manpower advantage we could play you a lot of tape from this today it
[2:16:13.800 --> 2:16:17.560]  took up most of their day and we could marvel over it since when does the
[2:16:17.560 --> 2:16:22.720]  Pentagon declare war on a domestic news operation can't remember that ever
[2:16:22.720 --> 2:16:26.880]  happening but we're not gonna do that we're gonna pass because this is bigger
[2:16:26.880 --> 2:16:32.960]  than a feud with some flak at the Pentagon this is genuinely worrisome the
[2:16:32.960 --> 2:16:37.520]  Department of Defense has never been more aggressively or openly political
[2:16:37.520 --> 2:16:42.480]  tonight there are 2,500 American troops stationed in Afghanistan and they
[2:16:42.480 --> 2:16:46.680]  remain there to prevent the fall of Kabul to extremists at the same time
[2:16:46.680 --> 2:16:52.000]  there are 5,000 troops in our own capital tonight also as protection against
[2:16:52.000 --> 2:16:55.000]  extremists meaning people who voted for the losing candidate in the last
[2:16:55.000 --> 2:16:59.880]  election judging by those numbers the Pentagon is now twice as focused on
[2:16:59.880 --> 2:17:05.400]  controlling our own citizens as it is I'm controlling the Taliban meanwhile as
[2:17:05.400 --> 2:17:12.560]  Lloyd Austin hyperventilates about white supremacy there are real threats
[2:17:12.560 --> 2:17:18.240]  wow so Ezra Levant joins us rebel news calm a good friend of mine a great guy
[2:17:18.240 --> 2:17:24.200]  and he's now learning that he's under investigation with a Pentagon defense
[2:17:24.200 --> 2:17:29.080]  contractors at the request of Trudeau who says quote he admires the Chinese
[2:17:29.080 --> 2:17:34.720]  dictatorship on national TV and people clap so he's not a threat but Ezra
[2:17:34.720 --> 2:17:39.320]  Levant is so what we see is a coming out here of the military forces of the
[2:17:39.320 --> 2:17:43.680]  West against journalists same thing over in the UK Ezra Levant give us the
[2:17:43.680 --> 2:17:47.200]  latest on this and break down the story that I just broke a few hours ago I
[2:17:47.200 --> 2:17:52.640]  appreciate you giving us the quasi-exclusive sure it started when
[2:17:52.640 --> 2:18:01.600]  Rebecca Ghoulsby who's with the US Navy cyber intelligence she contracted a
[2:18:01.600 --> 2:18:06.280]  unit at the University of Arkansas in Little Rock to do what they call a
[2:18:06.280 --> 2:18:13.280]  cyber forensic analysis of my media company rebel news calm so the US Navy
[2:18:13.280 --> 2:18:20.080]  paid money we don't know how much to a little unit at the you of Arkansas to do
[2:18:20.080 --> 2:18:24.440]  a workup on us and I read that report and I'll tell you how I found it in a
[2:18:24.440 --> 2:18:31.360]  minute and they claimed we were engaging in influence operations using deep fake
[2:18:31.360 --> 2:18:36.280]  websites it was absurd they actually claimed and you know I'm a pretty
[2:18:36.280 --> 2:18:40.520]  conservative guy Alex I mean we sure looks like they're not supposed to be
[2:18:40.520 --> 2:18:43.440]  looking at journalists they're not supposed to be looking at Americans or
[2:18:43.440 --> 2:18:46.840]  even Canadians they're not supposed to then put out false reports on us but
[2:18:46.840 --> 2:18:51.220]  that's what's going on yeah they came up with this bizarre report that claimed
[2:18:51.220 --> 2:18:56.160]  we were trying to get Justin Trudeau out to be replaced with a socialist
[2:18:56.160 --> 2:19:02.080]  candidate it's crazy we're very hostile to the socialists in Canada that's you
[2:19:02.080 --> 2:19:07.880]  know it so it was really really weird this junk report that they wrote just
[2:19:07.880 --> 2:19:15.320]  making up stuff but the US Navy paid them for it but then this defense
[2:19:15.320 --> 2:19:22.800]  contractor at University of Arkansas they resold the same info to Trudeau's
[2:19:22.800 --> 2:19:27.160]  Canadian Armed Forces so I don't know what my let me just tell you that's the
[2:19:27.160 --> 2:19:30.560]  answer yeah they want to demonize you to the Canadian Armed Forces because you
[2:19:30.560 --> 2:19:33.800]  expose the Chinese troops secretly training you expose Trudeau you're the
[2:19:33.800 --> 2:19:37.160]  main guy doing it and so they know the troops are patriotic and conservative so
[2:19:37.160 --> 2:19:40.160]  they say you're a commie but that'll just backfire on them the troops aren't
[2:19:40.160 --> 2:19:45.640]  stupid yeah I find I find it very confusing I don't know what my rights
[2:19:45.640 --> 2:19:50.320]  are in America because I'm not an American citizen our operations are not
[2:19:50.320 --> 2:19:54.000]  in America we have a lot of viewers in America say this in any administration in
[2:19:54.000 --> 2:19:57.640]  liberals got spied on by the Pentagon it would be major congressional hearings
[2:19:57.640 --> 2:20:02.680]  five alarm fires people pissing themselves that's right so my theory one
[2:20:02.680 --> 2:20:07.600]  of my theories is that Trudeau because he didn't want to spy on us directly my
[2:20:07.600 --> 2:20:12.720]  theory is maybe he got someone in the States to spy on us for him well that's
[2:20:12.720 --> 2:20:17.120]  how it's always done that's how they had the British spy on Trump exactly but then
[2:20:17.120 --> 2:20:22.960]  bizarrely the Canadian Armed Forces paid this Arkansas defense contractor for
[2:20:22.960 --> 2:20:28.600]  the same work and then they published it they actually published their study and
[2:20:28.600 --> 2:20:32.840]  that's how I found out about it so I never knew I was being spied on by the
[2:20:32.840 --> 2:20:37.840]  US Navy I never knew that the University of Arkansas defense contractor their
[2:20:37.840 --> 2:20:42.800]  little cell there was you know and their job was how do we hurt this great you
[2:20:42.800 --> 2:20:45.920]  know conservative Jewish man that stands up for everybody's rights we'll just say
[2:20:45.920 --> 2:20:50.680]  he's a commie to the troops they lied yeah I mean it's it was such a weird
[2:20:50.680 --> 2:20:56.240]  allegation and you know what a deep fake is Alex that's these videos which you
[2:20:56.240 --> 2:21:00.560]  you've never done yeah no I mean there's some deep fakes out there of Tom
[2:21:00.560 --> 2:21:05.360]  Cruz that are really spooky and I agree that deep fakes pose a challenge to
[2:21:05.360 --> 2:21:08.800]  everyone who's trying to make sense of the world I have no doubt that they'll
[2:21:08.800 --> 2:21:13.040]  be used nefariously we've never made a deep fake in our lives we don't have the
[2:21:13.040 --> 2:21:18.680]  technology of deep fakes of me on the internet it's a deep fake is like the
[2:21:18.680 --> 2:21:24.720]  famous movies out there with people like Tom Hanks where they show him meeting
[2:21:24.720 --> 2:21:29.800]  with JFK and it's a fake video I mean that's all that means right exactly I
[2:21:29.800 --> 2:21:33.720]  mean I guess it goes back to force come that's what you're talking about but
[2:21:33.720 --> 2:21:38.920]  we've never done that in our lives so this defense contractor here's my theory
[2:21:38.920 --> 2:21:43.120]  I mean and I open to new information I'm being stonewalled by the way I phoned
[2:21:43.120 --> 2:21:49.560]  the spy master at the US Navy I left her a message I sent her an email I phoned
[2:21:49.560 --> 2:21:53.560]  the defense contractor I sent them an email they haven't got back to me I'm
[2:21:53.560 --> 2:21:58.000]  not surprised but I want to ask them why did you choose me why didn't you check
[2:21:58.000 --> 2:22:02.120]  your basic facts and what's the whole game here like we're you know we're a
[2:22:02.120 --> 2:22:07.760]  fairly small fish in the sea so to speak and it's the US Navy I'm from a
[2:22:07.760 --> 2:22:12.280]  landlocked province called Alberta I don't even have a canoe why is the Navy
[2:22:12.280 --> 2:22:17.320]  so interested in me I'm a civilian journalist imagine if you learn imagine
[2:22:17.320 --> 2:22:21.880]  if it became known that the Canadian Armed Forces was snooping around let's
[2:22:21.880 --> 2:22:27.720]  say Jim Acosta or Anderson Cooper a huge deal so stay there I interrupted a lot
[2:22:27.720 --> 2:22:31.160]  and I brought in key points we come back how you discovered this I can tell you
[2:22:31.160 --> 2:22:34.480]  why they're doing it to you and and where all this is going and part of the
[2:22:34.480 --> 2:22:38.400]  course with Justin Trudeau who will play the clip not a deep fake praising
[2:22:38.400 --> 2:22:41.920]  ggp and the most brutal dictatorship in world history as well as an event of
[2:22:41.920 --> 2:22:45.840]  rebel news comms our guest I don't hear the cry
[2:22:45.840 --> 2:22:52.760]  yippee-ki-yip I'm not gonna sit here and waste your time or my time and
[2:22:52.760 --> 2:22:58.880]  rattle off the successes and pull worse is that if you're paying attention you
[2:22:58.880 --> 2:23:05.440]  know we've done together but I'll tell you this the technocrats are really
[2:23:05.440 --> 2:23:09.760]  upping their game and they are trying to destroy all independent forms of
[2:23:09.760 --> 2:23:14.640]  media they're trying to shudder and silence human resistance so now is the
[2:23:14.640 --> 2:23:18.640]  time to understand that everything we've talked about has been proven accurate
[2:23:18.640 --> 2:23:22.240]  everything you warned your friends and family about it's about to be true so
[2:23:22.240 --> 2:23:25.840]  it's now that your credibility is way up the power structure should have
[2:23:25.840 --> 2:23:32.000]  silenced those of us that they can't but it's up to all of us to not let them
[2:23:32.000 --> 2:23:37.480]  silence any of us we have the power but the Sun is setting on humanity and
[2:23:37.480 --> 2:23:42.920]  setting on free speech we have to make sure that we find hard right now to make
[2:23:42.920 --> 2:23:48.600]  sure that long dark night doesn't come so be the polar bearer as you are

[2:26:51.760 --> 2:27:11.120]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[2:27:22.720 --> 2:27:31.400]  so as we're at LaVance established long-term journalists were a national
[2:27:31.400 --> 2:27:37.560]  network in Canada runs international network there's a lot of great legal
[2:27:37.560 --> 2:27:42.600]  work for free speech a very conservative respected guy they know who he is not
[2:27:42.600 --> 2:27:48.400]  somebody just popped up here has a Pentagon connected the Navy group then
[2:27:48.400 --> 2:27:52.920]  then tied into the Army and the rest of it spying on him and creating fake
[2:27:52.920 --> 2:27:57.040]  reports on him and then he asked what is this well this is propaganda this is
[2:27:57.040 --> 2:28:01.200]  you being set up and this shows how at the top we have the Confucius
[2:28:01.200 --> 2:28:06.240]  institutes the chai comms the globalist in control and they are now converting the
[2:28:06.240 --> 2:28:10.720]  main military once Biden got in it's accelerated against people that are
[2:28:10.720 --> 2:28:14.640]  resisting the takeovers of Canada the takeovers of the US Australia you name
[2:28:14.640 --> 2:28:19.840]  it and so the average person in the military is just following orders they
[2:28:19.840 --> 2:28:24.600]  just conduit the money through into the groups who then put out the dis info
[2:28:24.600 --> 2:28:28.320]  obviously the group that funded the US military to do this directed them of
[2:28:28.320 --> 2:28:32.040]  where to send the money so it's also a major money laundering operation and
[2:28:32.040 --> 2:28:35.440]  that's why we're in so much trouble I remember hearings last three years in
[2:28:35.440 --> 2:28:39.160]  the House Armed Services Committee they go well an example of a Russian agents
[2:28:39.160 --> 2:28:44.000]  Alex Jones I have no Russian connections I'm totally patriotic not many people
[2:28:44.000 --> 2:28:47.160]  probably have family members that actually were involved in Iran Contra and
[2:28:47.160 --> 2:28:51.040]  also things in Europe mine was I mean actually killing Russians in the 80s and
[2:28:51.040 --> 2:28:55.800]  so it's very insulting it's it's like saying you know that Superman's with
[2:28:55.800 --> 2:28:59.880]  Lex Luthor or something but that's what they do because it's a foreign takeover
[2:28:59.880 --> 2:29:03.440]  and now the new Secretary of Defense is working with honor a saying we're going
[2:29:03.440 --> 2:29:06.840]  to get the guns we're gonna have war with the gun owners just having guns as
[2:29:06.840 --> 2:29:10.600]  white supremacism they're training the military so they're preparing for a
[2:29:10.600 --> 2:29:14.040]  pair they're preparing for war and and you're one of the main you say you're
[2:29:14.040 --> 2:29:17.560]  small you're not small you're huge you reach tens of millions a week they know
[2:29:17.560 --> 2:29:21.760]  you're exposing Trudeau up there in that desert of information you're a big
[2:29:21.760 --> 2:29:25.160]  oasis so they're coming at me so I'm gonna shut up now but just get we get
[2:29:25.160 --> 2:29:30.240]  into how big this is because this is this is absolutely huge well and we
[2:29:30.240 --> 2:29:35.560]  wouldn't have found out about it had the same defense contractor not resold the
[2:29:35.560 --> 2:29:40.120]  same info to the Canadian Armed Forces which for some reason published it as a
[2:29:40.120 --> 2:29:44.600]  part of a study so I started following the breadcrumbs back to the University
[2:29:44.600 --> 2:29:49.480]  of Arkansas defense contractor and then back to the US Navy so here's some
[2:29:49.480 --> 2:29:54.600]  questions that come to my mind who else are they spying on like this anyone else
[2:29:54.600 --> 2:30:00.120]  in Canada are they spying on you Alex I think they probably are I want to tell
[2:30:00.120 --> 2:30:02.800]  you this is par for the course for anybody effective anybody loyal
[2:30:02.800 --> 2:30:06.840]  anybody good yeah I mean if you weren't such a good guy this wouldn't be
[2:30:06.840 --> 2:30:12.120]  happening buddy I was about to say you can expect this well I mean and that goes
[2:30:12.120 --> 2:30:16.560]  to my next question how else are they spying it's one thing for them to you
[2:30:16.560 --> 2:30:20.920]  know work up reports on my website but are they actually hacking it are they
[2:30:20.920 --> 2:30:25.280]  eavesdropping are they using human intelligence have they sent people in
[2:30:25.280 --> 2:30:32.120]  to infiltrate our organization what else are they doing that that I haven't
[2:30:32.120 --> 2:30:36.880]  detected because I I didn't detect this spying on us until the Canadian Armed
[2:30:36.880 --> 2:30:42.080]  Forces blabbed in some military journal the US Navy and the University of
[2:30:42.080 --> 2:30:45.640]  Arkansas they were tight-lipped it was the Canadian Armed Forces that blab
[2:30:45.640 --> 2:30:49.880]  about it so who else are they spying on is it Glenn Beck did they spy on Rush
[2:30:49.880 --> 2:30:56.200]  Limbaugh how about on you know did big websites well let me give you the
[2:30:56.200 --> 2:31:00.600]  answer you saw soccer a month ago and then now Biden they said we have the
[2:31:00.600 --> 2:31:04.640]  Department of Defense and intelligence agencies with laser focus working against
[2:31:04.640 --> 2:31:09.360]  right-wingers and entrap supporters and so yeah they're watching everybody here's
[2:31:09.360 --> 2:31:16.120]  another question so how else are they spying but who is behind it you've
[2:31:16.120 --> 2:31:21.640]  talked about how foreign intelligence agencies are sometimes used to get around
[2:31:21.640 --> 2:31:26.680]  ethics or other laws so for example maybe the US Navy was sent against me
[2:31:26.680 --> 2:31:33.280]  cuz Trudeau wanted to insulate himself maybe you UK or Canadian spies are
[2:31:33.280 --> 2:31:39.400]  going after Americans again so they don't trip over laws banning a country's
[2:31:39.400 --> 2:31:44.840]  military from spying on its own citizens because it might be that the Navy US
[2:31:44.840 --> 2:31:49.320]  Navy is allowed to spy on me because I'm not an American and the Canadian Armed
[2:31:49.320 --> 2:31:52.800]  Forces are allowed to spy on you because you're not a Canadian maybe they're
[2:31:52.800 --> 2:31:57.440]  basically log rolling and saying I'll spy on your guys you spy on my guys and
[2:31:57.440 --> 2:32:01.680]  we'll pretend it's all kosher but I guess a big question is what were they
[2:32:01.680 --> 2:32:06.360]  trying to achieve were they trying to set the table for wiping us off the
[2:32:06.360 --> 2:32:10.680]  internet de-platforming us by trying to compare us to I don't know like a North
[2:32:10.680 --> 2:32:15.200]  Korean hacker or an Iranian hacker there really are bad actors out there in
[2:32:15.200 --> 2:32:21.120]  cyberspace many of them are Chinese North Korean Iranian there are some
[2:32:21.120 --> 2:32:26.880]  Russians too of course are they were they trying to demonize rebel news so
[2:32:26.880 --> 2:32:30.120]  that we could be swept off the internet and now wait a minute you're the guy
[2:32:30.120 --> 2:32:33.360]  that got the secret documents that he was had secret Chinese troops training
[2:32:33.360 --> 2:32:37.240]  and infiltrate your military and your own military last year was concerned how
[2:32:37.240 --> 2:32:40.840]  dare you it's not like your prime minister pledged allegiance to the
[2:32:40.840 --> 2:32:45.640]  dictatorship I mean we have a clip of it here it is
[2:32:45.640 --> 2:32:54.120]  admiration I actually have for China because their basic dictatorship is
[2:32:54.120 --> 2:32:58.520]  allowing them to actually turn their economy around on a dime and say we
[2:32:58.520 --> 2:33:02.560]  need to go green as fast as we need to start you know investing in solar I'll
[2:33:02.560 --> 2:33:06.080]  be there is a flexibility that I know Stephen Harper must dream about of
[2:33:06.080 --> 2:33:10.800]  having a dictatorship that he could do everything you want by the way you see
[2:33:10.800 --> 2:33:14.520]  and that's not it that's not a green screen it's not a deep fake it's in the
[2:33:14.520 --> 2:33:18.320]  national post show that to that he said that but they're trying to claim that
[2:33:18.320 --> 2:33:22.000]  Ezra is doing that the military thinking they're stupid but let's expand even the
[2:33:22.000 --> 2:33:25.840]  lie that China is going green faster they're the worst and aren't even
[2:33:25.840 --> 2:33:30.040]  attempting it everything it's incredible sorry go ahead you know you're so
[2:33:30.040 --> 2:33:34.480]  right you know I follow the People's Liberation Army that's the name of the
[2:33:34.480 --> 2:33:39.880]  Chinese military and what they call the PLA Navy and I'm genuinely worried
[2:33:39.880 --> 2:33:44.920]  Alex did you know that they're building their fourth aircraft carrier now
[2:33:44.920 --> 2:33:48.320]  they're not the biggest in the world right now they're building a giant
[2:33:48.320 --> 2:33:53.320]  blue water Navy yeah and and they're they're not yet at full operational
[2:33:53.320 --> 2:33:58.920]  capacity they don't have the decades of experience of the US Navy but I tell you
[2:33:58.920 --> 2:34:03.440]  the US Navy has some real threats and they're mainly coming from China it's
[2:34:03.440 --> 2:34:10.600]  insane to me that the US Navy would be focusing its cyber security on peaceful
[2:34:10.600 --> 2:34:14.960]  civilian journalists who by the way on a pro-American guy if anybody I have you
[2:34:14.960 --> 2:34:18.440]  at the War College the Naval War College teaching folks how to be a patriot or
[2:34:18.440 --> 2:34:21.960]  how to be effective promoting freedom they should be promoting freedom they
[2:34:21.960 --> 2:34:26.000]  should be doing what you're doing well and let me give you an update you
[2:34:26.000 --> 2:34:31.160]  mentioned Trudeau he has through his entire career as Prime Minister being
[2:34:31.160 --> 2:34:35.680]  very pro-China quick example you know the Uighur Muslim ethnic minority in
[2:34:35.680 --> 2:34:40.040]  Western China there was a vote in Canada's Parliament to declare that a
[2:34:40.040 --> 2:34:45.160]  genocide and you can agree or disagree but there was a vote take a stand well
[2:34:45.160 --> 2:34:49.400]  it's definitely a genocide of anything is yeah I mean I think it checks a lot of
[2:34:49.400 --> 2:34:54.800]  the legal boxes so okay there's a vote in the Parliament and Trudeau is in the
[2:34:54.800 --> 2:35:00.960]  Parliament he refused to show up his entire cabinet in Canada the cabinet is
[2:35:00.960 --> 2:35:06.280]  part of the legislature so he's a icon agent that had the US government spy on
[2:35:06.280 --> 2:35:10.800]  you because you're over the target he is an absolute outrage like literally a
[2:35:10.800 --> 2:35:18.000]  couple of weeks ago he simply would not cast a vote he hid he did not even walk
[2:35:18.000 --> 2:35:23.000]  into the chamber to vote yes or no he didn't even abstain he literally was
[2:35:23.000 --> 2:35:28.120]  absent that day because he didn't want to offend his buddies over in China and
[2:35:28.120 --> 2:35:32.920]  right now there's two Canadian hostages who were kidnapped off the streets of
[2:35:32.920 --> 2:35:39.600]  Beijing held hostage because Canada arrested the CFO of Huawei to extradite
[2:35:39.600 --> 2:35:43.960]  to the states for fraud charges yeah the daughter of the top general yeah so
[2:35:43.960 --> 2:35:49.000]  right now China is holding two hostage they're hostages they were kidnapped
[2:35:49.000 --> 2:35:54.880]  they're going through a sham trial right now Trudeau I wish Trudeau hated them
[2:35:54.880 --> 2:36:01.640]  spied on them was as rhetorically abusive to the commonest Chinese as he is
[2:36:01.640 --> 2:36:06.920]  to a law-abiding patriotic peaceful civilian well this is a national channel
[2:36:06.920 --> 2:36:11.280]  I mean if Nixon got in trouble for breaking into a psychiatrist's office
[2:36:11.280 --> 2:36:16.000]  what should they do for spying on you and then lying about you and again folks
[2:36:16.000 --> 2:36:19.680]  this is only the tip of the iceberg we're not liberals whining we're victims
[2:36:19.680 --> 2:36:23.200]  as well as over the targets this is a badge of honor but it's illegal what's
[2:36:23.200 --> 2:36:27.120]  happening and it's very dangerous and if you think this is only going on or
[2:36:27.120 --> 2:36:31.160]  Tucker Carlson think again because as he said it takes away the resources of
[2:36:31.160 --> 2:36:35.640]  dealing with the Red Dragon final segment with Ezra Levant ahead then the one

[2:38:48.240 --> 2:38:55.840]  store.com I knew Trump was in battle I knew he was surrounded by cowards and
[2:38:55.840 --> 2:39:02.680]  by double talking agents of the enemy a lot of people just couldn't believe it
[2:39:02.680 --> 2:39:08.120]  right oh no it's 3d chess 5d chess he's invincible and I understand what people
[2:39:08.120 --> 2:39:11.000]  are going to believe that because this is scary what's going on the global
[2:39:11.000 --> 2:39:14.120]  government the new world order and now that people have the fact that's real
[2:39:14.120 --> 2:39:18.280]  they won't somebody to come save them from well Trump sure as hell tried my
[2:39:18.280 --> 2:39:21.920]  gosh look at how prescription drug prices just tripled or quadruple depending
[2:39:21.920 --> 2:39:26.000]  on the drug once by the silent executive order we pay the most of anybody in the
[2:39:26.000 --> 2:39:30.120]  world that's just one case of hundreds of things the trumpet reversed and now
[2:39:30.120 --> 2:39:34.400]  people are gonna feel the sting in the pain energy cost everything else but
[2:39:34.400 --> 2:39:38.640]  what's really illustrated this is the trial to the Senate where Trump's own
[2:39:38.640 --> 2:39:42.320]  lawyers are attacking him and putting him down and saying he lost the election
[2:39:42.320 --> 2:39:47.400]  and just engage all sorts of criminal activity because the fix is in folks the
[2:39:47.400 --> 2:39:53.200]  swamp is deep Trump fought it but it's up to us to win it the entire new world
[2:39:53.200 --> 2:39:58.160]  order system is about making you feel pathetic making you feel weak making you
[2:39:58.160 --> 2:40:02.280]  play the part of a victim so you don't take your birthright as being made the
[2:40:02.280 --> 2:40:06.920]  image of God and the incredible mission and destiny we have being given free will
[2:40:06.920 --> 2:40:12.160]  being given free will being given consciousness is literally the seed of
[2:40:12.160 --> 2:40:17.600]  an entire universe an entire system and the fact that you're able to commune
[2:40:17.600 --> 2:40:21.280]  with God the fact you're able to see the beauty of the sunset or the beauty of
[2:40:21.280 --> 2:40:24.840]  the waves in the ocean or the beauty of your wife your husband the beauty of
[2:40:24.840 --> 2:40:28.920]  your child learning knowledge the beauty of music the fact that you can
[2:40:28.920 --> 2:40:33.880]  commune with that and resonate with that is energetic and that itself is what
[2:40:33.880 --> 2:40:38.680]  God teaches us is worship so don't worship the globalist don't worship the
[2:40:38.680 --> 2:40:42.840]  NFL don't worship all the things of the system but worship the things of God
[2:40:42.840 --> 2:40:47.120]  because we're made by God and appreciate your consciousness and appreciate
[2:40:47.120 --> 2:40:51.960]  free speech while you still have it while you still have it
[2:40:51.960 --> 2:40:59.080]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[2:41:08.280 --> 2:41:12.160]  you know I can tell you something that happened I don't know this is like 20
[2:41:12.160 --> 2:41:16.040]  something years ago now I was covered operation urban warrior where the
[2:41:16.040 --> 2:41:19.680]  Marines were training in California for a future gun conversation under Bill
[2:41:19.680 --> 2:41:24.000]  Clinton's orders very unconstitutional train they were given but it backfired
[2:41:24.000 --> 2:41:28.480]  and made the Marines wake up even better and so I later had some Navy Seals and
[2:41:28.480 --> 2:41:34.280]  Marines come and show me in my office all this classified video of them with
[2:41:34.280 --> 2:41:38.040]  drones following us and then watching us at the hotel and how it totally woke the
[2:41:38.040 --> 2:41:41.240]  military up even more about us being there saying what are you doing the
[2:41:41.240 --> 2:41:44.920]  role players for gun confiscation so again the average military people are
[2:41:44.920 --> 2:41:48.640]  some of the best folks out there but it's the globalist politically in control
[2:41:48.640 --> 2:41:53.080]  now and the reason Ezra Levant and rebel media and info wars and others and
[2:41:53.080 --> 2:41:57.880]  Tucker Carlson are so important is we're there speaking directly to the
[2:41:57.880 --> 2:42:01.720]  military so it can't be fully taken over by this and that's why Biden's doing
[2:42:01.720 --> 2:42:05.600]  this purge of the military now where if you were ever pro-america pro-gun pro-
[2:42:05.600 --> 2:42:09.520]  Trump well you're a terrorist and and so that's really where this is all going
[2:42:09.520 --> 2:42:13.640]  there's a fight over our infrastructure over our institutions Ezra Levant you
[2:42:13.640 --> 2:42:18.200]  were making some amazing points let's finish up with this and then let's move
[2:42:18.200 --> 2:42:22.720]  forward with any other big issues that are on your radar screen sure let's say
[2:42:22.720 --> 2:42:27.840]  you wanted to destroy the police in the United States you could say defund the
[2:42:27.840 --> 2:42:32.600]  police and announced your intentions publicly like that but I think people
[2:42:32.600 --> 2:42:37.200]  might rally around the police and say well that's not such a good idea but
[2:42:37.200 --> 2:42:41.320]  let's say you wanted to actually be effective then you would infiltrate the
[2:42:41.320 --> 2:42:45.960]  police and have them do things that discredit them in the public eye you
[2:42:45.960 --> 2:42:50.640]  would have them take a knee and and debase themselves you would perhaps
[2:42:50.640 --> 2:42:55.920]  send them as lockdown police to abuse civil liberties and so then you would
[2:42:55.920 --> 2:43:00.680]  erode the police support from their own conservative base so instead of saying I
[2:43:00.680 --> 2:43:04.920]  want to destroy the police by defunding you would be more clever you'd put in
[2:43:04.920 --> 2:43:08.760]  police chiefs here and there and do things that ordinary conservatives would
[2:43:08.760 --> 2:43:12.120]  turn against their own people you could say the same thing happened to the NFL
[2:43:12.120 --> 2:43:16.160]  and NASCAR to make them woke you know those used to be conservative
[2:43:16.160 --> 2:43:20.320]  institutions you could say I'm gonna destroy the NFL or you could just turn
[2:43:20.320 --> 2:43:25.440]  it into a woke-a-thon and peep and consider the destroy something is to
[2:43:25.440 --> 2:43:29.440]  lead it if you want to destroy it lead it into destruction that's Robert
[2:43:29.440 --> 2:43:33.920]  conquest third law the best way to understand any organization is a cabal
[2:43:33.920 --> 2:43:41.840]  of its enemies so let's apply that to the U.S. military how do you that's a
[2:43:41.840 --> 2:43:45.400]  very conservative institution it's a right-wing institution it's beloved by
[2:43:45.400 --> 2:43:49.080]  Americans on the right it should be beloved by all Americans well if you
[2:43:49.080 --> 2:43:53.840]  want to discredit the U.S. military you make it go after Tucker Carlson with
[2:43:53.840 --> 2:43:58.600]  these woke-a-thons you make them wear high heels shoes you you spy on
[2:43:58.600 --> 2:44:02.920]  conservatives so at the very least you're taking them off their real mission
[2:44:02.920 --> 2:44:07.480]  defending against China and if any conservatives are paying attention they
[2:44:07.480 --> 2:44:12.040]  start to have doubts and lose respect for the institution I believe that this
[2:44:12.040 --> 2:44:15.760]  is a double win for the less oh I totally admit that's their plan so how do
[2:44:15.760 --> 2:44:19.760]  you I know all these great military people getting out because they know
[2:44:19.760 --> 2:44:24.120]  it's happening at some level I know it's a hard job stay in just don't let the
[2:44:24.120 --> 2:44:29.600]  commies kick you out and then be there to to be a American infiltrator in the
[2:44:29.600 --> 2:44:33.920]  system itself it just like the commies infiltrate we've got to be the agent in
[2:44:33.920 --> 2:44:39.880]  place that stays there yeah I mean it's like the FBI what James Comey did to
[2:44:39.880 --> 2:44:43.440]  that institution has destroyed it in the eyes of many Americans such as
[2:44:43.440 --> 2:44:47.880]  conservatives and I think that we need to expose this I'm gonna call it a deep
[2:44:47.880 --> 2:44:52.680]  state because it is a kind of deep state within the military I mean the U.S.
[2:44:52.680 --> 2:44:56.840]  Navy has a hundred and sixty one billion dollar a year budget there are so many
[2:44:56.840 --> 2:45:00.680]  people working in there there there are not as criminal factions hiding within
[2:45:00.680 --> 2:45:05.200]  it because Congress doesn't know their ass from all the ground yeah and by the
[2:45:05.200 --> 2:45:09.920]  way for every person actually sailing on a ship guarding against the People's
[2:45:09.920 --> 2:45:14.680]  Liberation Army Navy there's probably two paper pushers like this would be spy
[2:45:14.680 --> 2:45:20.280]  queen who's going after us so I think that part of it is just the military
[2:45:20.280 --> 2:45:25.640]  industrial complex the size of the bureaucracy I think there's mission
[2:45:25.640 --> 2:45:29.720]  creep I think the long march through the institutions that we've all seen through
[2:45:29.720 --> 2:45:33.980]  the universities and the media has happened in the military to I think one
[2:45:33.980 --> 2:45:40.120]  solution is a James O'Keefe style project veritas style expose of what's
[2:45:40.120 --> 2:45:45.080]  going on in the inside I think obviously that has to be done by Americans in the
[2:45:45.080 --> 2:45:48.920]  military exactly not exposing military stuff it would just have to be the
[2:45:48.920 --> 2:45:52.760]  ideology of the people running the operations all right yeah I'm not
[2:45:52.760 --> 2:45:56.840]  talking about exposing that national security secrets I'm talking about the
[2:45:56.840 --> 2:46:02.420]  opposite I'm talking about showing how bureaucrats and politicians within the
[2:46:02.420 --> 2:46:08.160]  Navy and elsewhere are hijacking it for partisan purposes I I want to know the
[2:46:08.160 --> 2:46:13.280]  scale of it and I I want to tell you the scale it's so bad that I have people
[2:46:13.280 --> 2:46:17.480]  that have worked here in 2018 years who have a sister that's a teacher she now
[2:46:17.480 --> 2:46:22.160]  worships ggp in Minnesota and actually follows you and mainline liberals love
[2:46:22.160 --> 2:46:26.800]  ggp they believe me it's not just Trudeau on TV saying I love dictatorship I love
[2:46:26.800 --> 2:46:31.360]  ggp not just his dad meeting with Mao or Fidel Castro I mean these people are
[2:46:31.360 --> 2:46:37.800]  these people really love it well you know what what where's the ACLU if it was
[2:46:37.800 --> 2:46:45.160]  the young Turks or Jim Acosta or MSNBC or even Ellen or some of the leftists on
[2:46:45.160 --> 2:46:50.520]  the view who were spied on it would be top news the ACLU reporters without
[2:46:50.520 --> 2:46:55.160]  borders amnesty international all these so-called civil liberties with the
[2:46:55.160 --> 2:47:00.840]  Washington Correspondents group they would all be freaking out and with good
[2:47:00.840 --> 2:47:04.760]  reason because the government shouldn't spy on civilian journalists so it's not
[2:47:04.760 --> 2:47:08.680]  just the problem with the military it's the problem with the so-called civil
[2:47:08.680 --> 2:47:12.520]  liberties organizations that are really giving a past all this bad behavior
[2:47:12.520 --> 2:47:18.440]  they all got bought off by Soros the last ten years that's a fact and and they
[2:47:18.440 --> 2:47:23.200]  just simply no longer care about freedom in the way they did in the 60s and 70s
[2:47:23.200 --> 2:47:27.280]  I mean you can say what you like about hippies in the 60s and 70s but they
[2:47:27.280 --> 2:47:33.880]  seemed to actually believe in free speech was it restricting police oh well
[2:47:33.880 --> 2:47:36.920]  that was because the left was busy taking the system over now that they're the
[2:47:36.920 --> 2:47:40.800]  system I don't believe it any yeah you're right it was all just a temporary
[2:47:40.800 --> 2:47:44.880]  phase to get the levers of power and they don't want those levers of power
[2:47:44.880 --> 2:47:49.240]  fettered anymore now that they're what the ones wielding them I think it falls
[2:47:49.240 --> 2:47:54.040]  to conservatives to be the new civil liberties promoters there are a few
[2:47:54.040 --> 2:47:58.040]  good guys out there but they're small in number I think Naomi will she should
[2:47:58.040 --> 2:48:01.440]  advise the Clintons she came out and said the Democratic Party is pure evil
[2:48:01.440 --> 2:48:06.080]  fascism now it's true but you know the the fact that I knew you were gonna
[2:48:06.080 --> 2:48:10.680]  mention her because she's one of so few people you can count them on one hand's
[2:48:10.680 --> 2:48:14.920]  fingers Alex you should there should be so many liberals saying that that you
[2:48:14.920 --> 2:48:19.440]  couldn't even count them or name them all but it's there's so few in number and
[2:48:19.440 --> 2:48:24.560]  that's what's so sad is that the lockdown has taught us that not everyone in
[2:48:24.560 --> 2:48:29.160]  Canada the United States UK Australia actually believes in freedom in fact
[2:48:29.160 --> 2:48:32.720]  most people just go along to get along and you'd be surprised how quickly they

[2:49:08.320 --> 2:49:14.340]  fake reports on him they conduit out to the little commie organizations at the
[2:49:14.340 --> 2:49:19.880]  universities to then create a ridiculous document like that but at the end of the
[2:49:19.880 --> 2:49:25.080]  day ladies and gentlemen truth will win if we stay on air if we keep fighting if

[2:54:33.760 --> 2:54:38.680]  more detail on if you're a TV viewer you are gonna have to look at this
[2:54:38.680 --> 2:54:44.600]  creatures face but radio listeners are blessing on it see it raking. Farmer
[2:54:44.600 --> 2:54:48.480]  president of drag queen story hour foundation and children's court gudge
[2:54:48.480 --> 2:54:54.640]  yes arrested on seven counts of child porn. He also headed up the state's
[2:54:54.640 --> 2:55:04.720]  lgbtqp operation Brett Blum 38 was arrested for having the child porn it's
[2:55:04.720 --> 2:55:11.560]  reported and of course the couple has to adopt the children court records do not
[2:55:11.560 --> 2:55:16.960]  suggest they're part of the illegal issues child services involved with the
[2:55:16.960 --> 2:55:20.600]  current placement defense attorney Christopher van wanger said during the
[2:55:20.600 --> 2:55:25.800]  court hearing the Milwaukee Journal sent no reports that's why they're racing
[2:55:25.800 --> 2:55:30.640]  to legalize pedophilia and all this because this is the religion of these
[2:55:30.640 --> 2:55:36.400]  people but notice oh they have last week on HBO and they have the comedy
[2:55:36.400 --> 2:55:41.320]  simple shows with Noah and they make jokes and say there's no pedophilia
[2:55:41.320 --> 2:55:45.440]  there's no child rape there one of the best things Trump did was unleash the
[2:55:45.440 --> 2:55:49.160]  police to go after these networks and they've been busted the hell out of them
[2:55:49.160 --> 2:55:54.200]  and notice they're almost always Democrats and they're so Republicans but I
[2:55:54.200 --> 2:56:01.720]  have a stack of this news today. Milwaukee judge and president of the drag
[2:56:01.720 --> 2:56:05.400]  queen story hour well who else would want to wear a wig and have kids jump on
[2:56:05.400 --> 2:56:12.640]  their crotch. Arrested after being charged with child pornography transgender
[2:56:12.640 --> 2:56:16.560]  YouTube star downloaded child porn images while running child care services
[2:56:16.560 --> 2:56:21.000]  multiple children reported being raped at the facility but they could never
[2:56:21.000 --> 2:56:25.080]  catch them so instead the police just got a search warrant and got the cell
[2:56:25.080 --> 2:56:33.640]  phone and that was enough. Child rights group in India asked police to probe
[2:56:33.640 --> 2:56:40.200]  Netflix show Bombay Begums and they got toddlers and tiaras and all the rest of it
[2:56:40.200 --> 2:56:46.520]  that's all these people are into folks it is absolutely sick meanwhile it
[2:56:46.520 --> 2:56:53.400]  turns out that a bunch of big leftist publications have come out. Daily Beast
[2:56:53.400 --> 2:56:58.360]  and Radar Online about court documents confirming the Clintons with little
[2:56:58.360 --> 2:57:05.360]  girls on the Jeffrey Epstein Lolita Express. Silence media outlets won't
[2:57:05.360 --> 2:57:09.760]  explain why Damien Clinton Epstein article was quietly deleted they didn't
[2:57:09.760 --> 2:57:13.960]  retract it. Like on the Wall Street Journal said that I launched the attack
[2:57:13.960 --> 2:57:17.320]  and led the attack on the Capitol. They said I stood on top of a car and said
[2:57:17.320 --> 2:57:21.840]  attack it when I did the opposite. You ever heard of a mode of dumbasses? Why
[2:57:21.840 --> 2:57:27.560]  would I want that? To destroy everything we're trying to peacefully do.
[2:57:27.560 --> 2:57:36.480]  Simply absolutely amazing. I have seen thousands of articles over the year out
[2:57:36.480 --> 2:57:41.040]  of the Netherlands, the UK, Germany, it's the same in Africa, it's the same in
[2:57:41.040 --> 2:57:45.520]  Latin America, it's the same everywhere. Where judges are caught running child
[2:57:45.520 --> 2:57:49.560]  kidnapping rinks and I'm not saying even a small percentage of judges are into it
[2:57:49.560 --> 2:57:53.560]  but a large percentage of pedophiles become judges they become truancy
[2:57:53.560 --> 2:57:57.360]  officers they become people that want to be able to do this with the power they
[2:57:57.360 --> 2:58:05.120]  have over children and here it is again so when you see John Oliver and Trevor
[2:58:05.120 --> 2:58:09.200]  Noah and the media saying none of this exists you see you see Twitter banning
[2:58:09.200 --> 2:58:12.440]  anybody criticizing convicted pedophiles remember that's who they are
[2:58:12.440 --> 2:58:16.360]  they're either into it or they're being protected by it. Remember Eric
[2:58:16.360 --> 2:58:22.680]  Ciramella's lawyer on his Twitter said I like to represent pedophiles I like to
[2:58:22.680 --> 2:58:28.760]  get them security clearances. Who the hell puts that out? They take our weakness
[2:58:28.760 --> 2:58:33.600]  as a as a green light to attack and it's time we stop being scared of these
[2:58:33.600 --> 2:58:38.480]  monsters you know if we didn't have any power to resist them they wouldn't be
[2:58:38.480 --> 2:58:41.440]  trying to censor us they were all powerful they're not all powerful. I got
[2:58:41.440 --> 2:58:45.000]  one more article I'm gonna hit on Joe Biden and then hand the baton to Matt
[2:58:45.000 --> 2:58:47.900]  Bracken stay with us.
[2:58:47.900 --> 2:58:52.800]  Blisters ask me all the time why do you have multiple multivitamins why do you
[2:58:52.800 --> 2:58:57.320]  have multiple high-quality iodine why do you do that because different strokes
[2:58:57.320 --> 2:59:00.640]  for different folks if we're talking to researchers and scientists and they say
[2:59:00.640 --> 2:59:05.080]  hey a lot of people love deep earth pure crystal iodine but you should put one
[2:59:05.080 --> 2:59:08.440]  out with deeper crystal iodine and the two other types because some people can
[2:59:08.440 --> 2:59:13.720]  absorb pure iodine. Boom we did it it's popular it's x3 is it better than x2 you
[2:59:13.720 --> 2:59:17.440]  decide it's different strokes different folks well now we have a compliment to

[3:00:05.920 --> 3:00:11.440]  and their minions their pumps and their pimps like to brag and hide things in
[3:00:11.440 --> 3:00:16.920]  plain view and if you go back to Senate report that's just four years old they
[3:00:16.920 --> 3:00:21.120]  confirmed by partisanly that tens of thousands of children smuggled across the
[3:00:21.120 --> 3:00:25.400]  border were placed out of the hundreds of thousands with a child sex traffickers
[3:00:25.400 --> 3:00:29.680]  that's the Senate report we'll show you that headline in a moment so that's why
[3:00:29.680 --> 3:00:35.280]  when sake comes out there's the headline and makes a joke about it yesterday
[3:00:35.280 --> 3:00:39.800]  and says any children that can get here get here well that means people grab
[3:00:39.800 --> 3:00:43.360]  children and kidnap them and use them to go across in some cases they found a
[3:00:43.360 --> 3:00:47.600]  little three-year-old girl that had been used over 20 times malnourished ribs
[3:00:47.600 --> 3:00:51.520]  poking out and they finally just dumped her in a field oh by the way she'd been
[3:00:51.520 --> 3:00:57.200]  raped innumerable times but it's okay if you're a trendy redhead chick it's like
[3:00:57.200 --> 3:01:00.680]  I'm a redhead chick I'm a woman so it's okay we run death camps
[3:01:00.680 --> 3:01:06.720]  Tim Cooks gay it's okay if he runs death camps in China with the Uyghurs it's like
[3:01:06.720 --> 3:01:09.720]  when they ask well the economy's collapsing well we appointed a woman to
[3:01:09.720 --> 3:01:14.600]  the head of small business oh my gosh that's great these people are soulless
[3:01:14.600 --> 3:01:19.160]  they're like mummies they're like ventriloquist dolls but who's pulling the
[3:01:19.160 --> 3:01:26.840]  strings hello who's actually talking we need to figure that out it's got a name
[3:01:26.840 --> 3:01:32.280]  called evil so flashback Biden told illegal immigrants to immediately
[3:01:32.280 --> 3:01:35.960]  surge the border if he's elected and then they did it wearing Biden shirts
[3:01:35.960 --> 3:01:40.880]  organized by the UN and then Texas has got tens of thousands border centers
[3:01:40.880 --> 3:01:48.160]  4,000 here at 3,000 here does there and then sake blames Trump that CBS reports
[3:01:48.160 --> 3:01:53.000]  there's 13,000 children in cages locked up right now that Trump never did but
[3:01:53.000 --> 3:01:57.800]  now see it's still Trump's fault this is so sick here's Biden telling illegal
[3:01:57.800 --> 3:02:01.280]  immigrants to immediately surge the border with the kidnapped children
[3:02:01.280 --> 3:02:05.040]  which they use as a get out of jail free card what I would do as president
[3:02:05.040 --> 3:02:09.040]  there's several more things because things have changed I would in fact make
[3:02:09.040 --> 3:02:14.040]  sure that there is we immediately surge to the border all those people are
[3:02:14.040 --> 3:02:18.140]  seeking asylum they deserve to be heard that's who we are we're a nation says
[3:02:18.140 --> 3:02:22.080]  if you want to flee and you're free in oppression you should come I would change
[3:02:22.080 --> 3:02:32.000]  you need to surge to the border with your kidnapped child we want blood and
[3:02:32.000 --> 3:02:36.000]  then it happens and they go though you need to stop what you're doing though
[3:02:36.000 --> 3:02:38.920]  they're bringing them in put them on welfare and then the government milks
[3:02:38.920 --> 3:02:43.240]  the money off the Democrats are like like an ant that milks and aphid suck the
[3:02:43.240 --> 3:02:47.680]  money off and look they're all wearing their Biden shirts the organized take
[3:02:47.680 --> 3:02:50.600]  down of the country so there you go it's all Trump's fault here's another one
[3:02:50.600 --> 3:02:55.800]  here is smug Jen Psaki announces any 10-year-old in the world who makes it
[3:02:55.800 --> 3:02:59.400]  across the border will be allowed to stay as long as someone brings you though
[3:02:59.400 --> 3:03:03.040]  she doesn't he's made the point out that a lot of them are kidnapped children so
[3:03:03.040 --> 3:03:07.600]  here's what her smart little smug face God is gonna curse her to hell look at
[3:03:07.600 --> 3:03:11.800]  that monstrous woman what us that's the female Bryant Skelter here's here's what
[3:03:11.800 --> 3:03:16.400]  she had to say inviting giant child smuggling openly here it is to make
[3:03:16.400 --> 3:03:19.880]  the system more efficient and effective limit or a cap to the number of
[3:03:19.880 --> 3:03:24.080]  unaccompanied minors that are going to be allowed into the US a limit or a cap
[3:03:24.080 --> 3:03:27.800]  should so should we send some kids who are 10 back at a certain point is that
[3:03:27.800 --> 3:03:31.760]  what you're asking me I'm not setting the policy here I'm just asking you what
[3:03:31.760 --> 3:03:36.920]  the Biden administration's policy is is there a limit to the number of children
[3:03:36.920 --> 3:03:40.640]  that will be allowed in I mean the numbers we're hearing now 565 on average
[3:03:40.640 --> 3:03:44.920]  every day I'm just curious what the what the end game is here how many
[3:03:44.920 --> 3:03:48.720]  ultimately would be allowed in well I think we're where we are as we're
[3:03:48.720 --> 3:03:54.720]  focused on some of the very specific numbers so when we came into office
[3:03:54.720 --> 3:04:00.640]  there existed about 13,000 permanent beds in HHS or permanent and inflex
[3:04:00.640 --> 3:04:05.400]  shelter system facilities during the last administration thousands of these
[3:04:05.400 --> 3:04:09.760]  beds approximately half were taken offline due to COVID staffing was also
[3:04:09.760 --> 3:04:14.640]  reduced to put it on par with the new reduced capacity this was
[3:04:14.640 --> 3:04:18.160]  sufficient for the prior prior administrations is how we got here because
[3:04:18.160 --> 3:04:22.400]  they were expelling children in addition to families and single adults we decided
[3:04:22.400 --> 3:04:27.160]  as you all know that we will be more humane about how we approach this there
[3:04:27.160 --> 3:04:31.360]  wasn't operational capacity built the prior administration also did not
[3:04:31.360 --> 3:04:34.480]  consider that there were other mitigation efforts like masking and
[3:04:34.480 --> 3:04:38.040]  prevent elation cohorting and other measures that would contain the spread
[3:04:38.040 --> 3:04:42.120]  of COVID there's now revised CDC guidance which means there's greater
[3:04:42.120 --> 3:04:46.880]  capacity in these facilities where we shut her up so so here's the oh she's
[3:04:46.880 --> 3:04:53.280]  wearing it was yesterday her st. Patty's outfit so it's okay so again oh it's
[3:04:53.280 --> 3:04:56.640]  COVID's while we're doing this no he invited him up he brought him up that's
[3:04:56.640 --> 3:05:03.160]  what they did absolutely insane totally illegal totally criminal and the
[3:05:03.160 --> 3:05:07.800]  reporters are demanding to know why they have zero access to the border and the
[3:05:07.800 --> 3:05:12.000]  answer again is COVID always COVID COVID's the reason the dollar is
[3:05:12.000 --> 3:05:14.760]  gonna go under COVID's the reason the border is gone COVID's the reason you're
[3:05:14.760 --> 3:05:18.320]  gonna go bankrupt COVID's the reason you took that shot and you died Matt
[3:05:18.320 --> 3:05:22.720]  Bracken of enemies farm domestic calm author researcher Navy Seal smart guy

[3:06:22.400 --> 3:06:28.000]  for the moment and it's part of the theme of my entire show today you know
[3:06:28.000 --> 3:06:32.240]  I'm going to be showing some of the of the Benny Thomas project Veritas
[3:06:32.240 --> 3:06:39.160]  Facebook video you know where he talks about when these transformed humans these
[3:06:39.160 --> 3:06:43.720]  AI humans are just gonna look down at us like ants and he says when I go to a
[3:06:43.720 --> 3:06:48.680]  picnic I don't I don't worry about how many ants I step on right and when when
[3:06:48.680 --> 3:06:55.040]  these transformed humans become fully singularized transformed they're gonna
[3:06:55.040 --> 3:06:59.280]  look at us like ants so I think they already do look at us like ants they
[3:06:59.280 --> 3:07:04.600]  just look at the globe and they say let's move millions from Guatemala or
[3:07:04.600 --> 3:07:11.040]  anywhere to America and the hell with Americans they're just the red ants the
[3:07:11.040 --> 3:07:17.240]  black ants the yellow ants you know the the soldier ants we just move an ants
[3:07:17.240 --> 3:07:21.360]  around and you know if you're you move an ants around you don't really give a
[3:07:21.360 --> 3:07:27.320]  damn if sometimes you step on a bunch of them or sometimes the fire ant poison
[3:07:27.320 --> 3:07:31.040]  kills the wrong kind that's right it's called playing god they're playing god
[3:07:31.040 --> 3:07:37.760]  there they Benny Thomas talks about when this AI happens when its chips are
[3:07:37.760 --> 3:07:43.160]  planted in everybody's brain or excuse me the elite's brains but I think at the
[3:07:43.160 --> 3:07:47.960]  Bill Gates level they already consider themselves there Bill Gates doesn't need
[3:07:47.960 --> 3:07:52.520]  a chip in his brain because he is surrounded by screens and super
[3:07:52.520 --> 3:07:56.640]  computers right he has all that information Benny Thomas later in that
[3:07:56.640 --> 3:08:02.560]  video talks about when these super elite transformed singularity humans have the
[3:08:02.560 --> 3:08:07.440]  chips they were going to be like a new species because they will have not only
[3:08:07.440 --> 3:08:12.960]  the ability to have like the entire Library of Congress in their head instant
[3:08:12.960 --> 3:08:17.400]  access everything but they'll be able to crunch all that information like a
[3:08:17.400 --> 3:08:22.280]  Superman like a god well I think that Bill Gates already considers himself in
[3:08:22.280 --> 3:08:28.420]  that status and and we are just ants to these people and they may even go to
[3:08:28.420 --> 3:08:32.640]  bed at night thinking well we're really doing a lot of good because we're
[3:08:32.640 --> 3:08:37.520]  helping more ants than we're destroying and it's all for the it's for the
[3:08:37.520 --> 3:08:42.680]  betterment of humanity that we're you know taking a rake and just raking the
[3:08:42.680 --> 3:08:48.200]  ants from here and smashing the ants over there but we singularized
[3:08:48.200 --> 3:08:54.480]  transformed humans we know what's best we are God and I think they are essential
[3:08:54.480 --> 3:09:00.440]  they are ascended we are not and they are already there when you and I think
[3:09:00.440 --> 3:09:04.720]  that Benny Thomas anybody that hasn't seen that project Veritas watch it ten
[3:09:04.720 --> 3:09:10.800]  times this is this is a guy who who listens to the inner circle this is like
[3:09:10.800 --> 3:09:16.880]  getting one of Hitler's cabinet one of his you know war staff to say what his
[3:09:16.880 --> 3:09:21.760]  really Hitler is thinking about and so what Benny Tom Thomas says in that
[3:09:21.760 --> 3:09:26.760]  project Veritas video should be ingrained in your brain this is how they
[3:09:26.760 --> 3:09:33.720]  comprehend us we are ants they are the superhumans and we are the ants and we've
[3:09:33.720 --> 3:09:38.880]  got to accept that and and prepare for what's coming
[3:09:39.480 --> 3:09:45.680]  anyway and this is gonna be the theme of the day and I'm very calm back in a
[3:09:45.680 --> 3:09:50.320]  couple minutes the people are awakening they're taking control of their own
[3:09:50.320 --> 3:09:54.520]  environment cell phones are an amazing tool really they're a super computer
[3:09:54.520 --> 3:09:58.680]  that's handheld but big tech large corporations hackers governments
[3:09:58.680 --> 3:10:03.320]  foreign governments the chai comms especially are using this to steal your
[3:10:03.320 --> 3:10:07.920]  data to share your data to be able to rig markets when they're able to scoop up
[3:10:07.920 --> 3:10:12.080]  billions of people's data they can actually predict on record what's gonna
[3:10:12.080 --> 3:10:18.120]  happen in mass movements cutting them out of that data stream absolutely
[3:10:18.120 --> 3:10:22.520]  devastates their AI takeover in their own words they admit it so I've been
[3:10:22.520 --> 3:10:25.880]  selling privacy pouches and block it pockets and things like that for more
[3:10:25.880 --> 3:10:29.000]  than a decade and now the units have gotten really lightweight they're
[3:10:29.000 --> 3:10:33.160]  faraday cages they just look like a cloth envelope they work absolutely great
[3:10:33.160 --> 3:10:37.760]  and it just gives you that security to have power over your data and power over
[3:10:37.760 --> 3:10:41.080]  your identity when you are traveling and don't want big brother to know what

[3:12:05.960 --> 3:12:14.760]  live from Austin Texas broadcasting worldwide it's Alex Jones and now your
[3:12:14.760 --> 3:12:19.040]  host Matt Bracken
[3:12:19.040 --> 3:12:25.920]  there is essentially evolving to become like human intelligence and then it's
[3:12:25.920 --> 3:12:31.960]  going to go beyond human intelligence and at that point humans are expandable
[3:12:31.960 --> 3:12:35.880]  you know the way we treat everything else in the world like we think we're
[3:12:35.880 --> 3:12:44.240]  the best like the superior most species so like if you and I went to a picnic we
[3:12:44.240 --> 3:12:48.680]  would not spend one minute thinking about the ants that we stepped on on the
[3:12:48.680 --> 3:12:54.480]  grass right for AI we will become like those ants it's not like the AI will
[3:12:54.480 --> 3:12:58.640]  try to kill us they just won't care because they'll be it'll be so superior
[3:12:58.640 --> 3:13:03.040]  that will be like these people don't matter so I might be killing hundreds of
[3:13:03.040 --> 3:13:14.080]  ants when I walk in the park I don't know and I don't care all I can say all I can
[3:13:14.080 --> 3:13:19.840]  say as well you know Benny Thomas says like global leader for Facebook so he's
[3:13:19.840 --> 3:13:25.800]  he's a he's a big shot he's somebody that's in the room at the table you know
[3:13:25.800 --> 3:13:29.680]  they say um Bannon as a saying if you're not in the room you're not in the deal
[3:13:29.680 --> 3:13:37.120]  okay Benny Thomas is in the room he's in the room at the at the high level and
[3:13:37.120 --> 3:13:43.800]  we are we are so we are so far beyond a constitutional republic where we vote
[3:13:43.800 --> 3:13:49.120]  for our leaders and it makes a damn we are so far beyond that people should
[3:13:49.120 --> 3:13:54.200]  watch that entire video not only does does Benny Thomas talk about you know
[3:13:54.200 --> 3:13:58.560]  ordinary humans being seen as ants which I believe they already believe
[3:13:58.560 --> 3:14:04.440]  Benny Thomas is sort of confessing he's saying in the future but at the at the
[3:14:04.440 --> 3:14:12.440]  Jack Dorsey at the at the at the the level of Google alphabet YouTube
[3:14:12.440 --> 3:14:18.960]  Twitter they are already there okay they are in their own minds in their own
[3:14:18.960 --> 3:14:23.640]  perceptions they are already the superhumans you know Benny Thomas in
[3:14:23.640 --> 3:14:28.680]  that in that video he's he's kind of I guess he's trying to play he's probably
[3:14:28.680 --> 3:14:33.240]  trying to get laid frankly okay this is why they they often send in like younger
[3:14:33.240 --> 3:14:39.480]  aspiring intern type female reporters you know that are trying to get a job while
[3:14:39.480 --> 3:14:43.080]  buttering some guy up and the guy's thinking if I say the right stuff I'll
[3:14:43.080 --> 3:14:47.040]  wind up in my hotel with her I mean let's this is let's be frank this is
[3:14:47.040 --> 3:14:51.440]  what's going on and little does he know she's she's actually a freedom fighter
[3:14:51.440 --> 3:14:57.600]  she is a freedom fighter like anybody you've ever seen in history and he's
[3:14:57.600 --> 3:15:04.040]  saying that Facebook has to be broken up that no king in history ever ruled two
[3:15:04.040 --> 3:15:11.120]  billion people all right and that Mark Zuckerberg already is that king so yes
[3:15:11.120 --> 3:15:15.520]  Mark Zuckerberg who spent who put something like 450 to 500 million
[3:15:15.520 --> 3:15:22.360]  dollars into defeating Trump in the last election cycle by funneling money to
[3:15:22.360 --> 3:15:28.480]  just Democrat precincts and districts to get out the vote you know the paying
[3:15:28.480 --> 3:15:32.880]  for the drop boxes paying overtime for all of these Democrat
[3:15:32.880 --> 3:15:39.720]  precinct officials it only in Democrat areas he already considers himself a
[3:15:39.720 --> 3:15:45.520]  God he considers himself way above obeying any like local national law to
[3:15:45.520 --> 3:15:51.920]  mark Zuckerberg a US law or a Belgian law or a or a Uganda law that's just a
[3:15:51.920 --> 3:15:57.160]  little hassle that's like avoiding a speed trap in some podium town you know
[3:15:57.160 --> 3:16:03.080]  in in Kansas or West Virginia to Mark Zuckerberg these are these are like
[3:16:03.080 --> 3:16:07.320]  literally the answer to picnic these laws these are things that you just have
[3:16:07.320 --> 3:16:13.800]  to work around he already is I think in his own perception that AI transformed
[3:16:13.800 --> 3:16:20.320]  superhuman so at this point the United States we have a government but really
[3:16:20.320 --> 3:16:26.640]  our poll our politicians from Biden to McConnell to all of them you know with
[3:16:26.640 --> 3:16:30.520]  the exception of some freedom fighters you know the Matt Gaetzes and the and
[3:16:30.520 --> 3:16:35.520]  the DeSantis's they're trying but they were such a tiny percentage they really
[3:16:35.520 --> 3:16:41.800]  can't move the needle the CCP the Chinese Communist Party has so infiltrated
[3:16:41.800 --> 3:16:47.080]  our country buying off universities buying off corporations through deals
[3:16:47.080 --> 3:16:51.720]  where you know if you don't if we can't send our people to your corporation in
[3:16:51.720 --> 3:16:55.360]  America where they'll essentially be spies then you're not going to do
[3:16:55.360 --> 3:17:00.600]  business in China between big tech if you if you make a conglomerate out of
[3:17:00.600 --> 3:17:06.720]  out of Google alphabet Facebook and Twitter if you make that into a
[3:17:06.720 --> 3:17:14.000]  conglomerate they have the other great power pole along with chair chairman
[3:17:14.000 --> 3:17:20.280]  Xi in Beijing those are the two real power players in the world when when
[3:17:20.280 --> 3:17:25.640]  we're looking at an American politician today we're like a Brit in say the
[3:17:25.640 --> 3:17:31.960]  1950s coasting on past memories of the glories of Great Britain but in
[3:17:31.960 --> 3:17:37.680]  reality the Navy of World War two has been scrapped it's a welfare state and
[3:17:37.680 --> 3:17:43.600]  it's broke that's the United States right now so the Brits in the 1950s
[3:17:43.600 --> 3:17:48.000]  thought we're still a world power we still have a Navy you know are we going
[3:17:48.000 --> 3:17:51.920]  to vote for Atley or are we going to vote for Churchill or who you know but it
[3:17:51.920 --> 3:17:59.040]  didn't matter the UK was done the power had moved on to the United States of
[3:17:59.040 --> 3:18:03.320]  America in a battle with global communism at the time the Soviet Union and
[3:18:03.320 --> 3:18:09.880]  the beginning of Communist China now the the power has moved on from the United
[3:18:09.880 --> 3:18:16.000]  States totally moved on now the power is balanced between Communist China and
[3:18:16.000 --> 3:18:23.080]  these tech tech giants our military at this point has and it's obvious it's
[3:18:23.080 --> 3:18:28.040]  become a joke it's become a joke it's been taken over it's been infiltrated
[3:18:28.040 --> 3:18:33.920]  and it's become just a woke shadow of itself yes we still have aircraft
[3:18:33.920 --> 3:18:39.600]  carriers however the aircraft carriers of today are the equivalent of a
[3:18:39.600 --> 3:18:45.960]  battleship in 1940 very impressive if you don't understand the next stage of
[3:18:45.960 --> 3:18:52.080]  warfare not impressive if you understand that dive bombers can take them out so
[3:18:52.080 --> 3:18:55.960]  our aircraft carriers which are very impressive and when they say all you do
[3:18:55.960 --> 3:19:02.960]  the South China Sea it looks powerful but today China can take them out if
[3:19:02.960 --> 3:19:07.920]  they're anywhere near China our aircraft carriers can't get close enough to
[3:19:07.920 --> 3:19:14.600]  Taiwan to defend Taiwan without them being destroyed by Chinese missiles and
[3:19:14.600 --> 3:19:19.160]  and I'll talk about this some more but when you think about the missiles
[3:19:19.160 --> 3:19:24.360]  missile wars of say 30 years ago Desert Storm when those scud twos were fired
[3:19:24.360 --> 3:19:30.600]  they were like a World War two v2 rocket plus or minus a mile wherever they
[3:19:30.600 --> 3:19:36.280]  land who knows inertial guidance have you seen how the Falcon X boosters land
[3:19:36.280 --> 3:19:42.000]  on a barge in the middle of the ocean controlling things coming in from space
[3:19:42.000 --> 3:19:49.280]  has evolved to a fine point than any any warships including our aircraft carriers
[3:19:49.280 --> 3:19:56.240]  that are anywhere near China are as obsolete as the battleships you know
[3:19:56.240 --> 3:20:01.960]  going into World War going into World War two it's just passé and we haven't
[3:20:01.960 --> 3:20:07.800]  learned this yet like the Brits in the 1950s we're still coasting on memories of
[3:20:07.800 --> 3:20:14.080]  our past glory and military power and that day is sunsetting and America is
[3:20:14.080 --> 3:20:19.760]  in for some some very rude awakenings in the near future military economic
[3:20:19.760 --> 3:20:24.440]  social and in other areas and I'm going to continue talking on the other side
[3:20:24.440 --> 3:20:31.200]  about the vaccine and what it means in terms of the of the the superhumans
[3:20:31.200 --> 3:20:36.760]  transforming the world and just treating us like ants that's exactly what's
[3:20:36.760 --> 3:20:41.760]  going on with COVID and the so-called COVID vaccines and we're going to explore
[3:20:41.760 --> 3:20:44.800]  this more on the other side
[3:20:45.520 --> 3:20:50.440]  you know listeners calling to the show and they thank me and it makes me feel
[3:20:50.440 --> 3:20:56.360]  pathetic because I sit there and I beg you for support constantly for prayer for
[3:20:56.360 --> 3:21:00.640]  financial support and for word of mouth and then we're all this together and I
[3:21:00.640 --> 3:21:04.080]  you know it gets old having to come to you and say hey I got great products
[3:21:04.080 --> 3:21:07.280]  please bomb or we won't be here on air but it's true for the only media
[3:21:07.280 --> 3:21:10.920]  organization in the United States that promotes liberty at this level that is
[3:21:10.920 --> 3:21:14.600]  not beholden to big corporate sponsors and they've harassed and almost shut down
[3:21:14.600 --> 3:21:17.920]  everybody else they crippled all the other groups and we're still here and
[3:21:17.920 --> 3:21:22.200]  as this whole new world order comes out in the open our credibility is going up
[3:21:22.200 --> 3:21:25.440]  that's why we've got to be taken off there that's why America has got to be
[3:21:25.440 --> 3:21:29.040]  taken down you can't have all these other nations enslaved and America still
[3:21:29.040 --> 3:21:33.480]  quasi-free you can't have info wars has been proven right being on air with all
[3:21:33.480 --> 3:21:36.800]  the craziness that's about to unfold because if you think stuff's bad now
[3:21:36.800 --> 3:21:40.760]  just get ready so thank you all and get an info or store.com get some great
[3:21:40.760 --> 3:21:44.720]  2020 election shirts supplements and so much more they're wonderful products and
[3:21:44.720 --> 3:21:50.360]  they support the info we're thank you. As negative as times are right now and as
[3:21:50.360 --> 3:21:55.960]  depressing as things can be you have to understand that this is all a test this
[3:21:55.960 --> 3:22:04.240]  experience this life on this planet is a reckoning it's God giving us a chance to
[3:22:04.240 --> 3:22:07.840]  work things out the third dimension so we can decide where we want to spend
[3:22:07.840 --> 3:22:12.280]  eternity and what level we want to go to and it really does come down to that so
[3:22:12.280 --> 3:22:16.280]  as sad as things are and as evil as things are look at all the good in the
[3:22:16.280 --> 3:22:21.120]  world as well and realize that God is the author of our consciousness God is the
[3:22:21.120 --> 3:22:26.640]  author of us having our own will God is the author of us having free will and
[3:22:26.640 --> 3:22:31.800]  that free will is a beautiful thing when you look at mainstream media in
[3:22:31.800 --> 3:22:36.360]  Hollywood and this whole evil culture Washington DC and Fauci and the and the
[3:22:36.360 --> 3:22:40.680]  mass cult it's all about dominating your free will it's all about telling you
[3:22:40.680 --> 3:22:43.920]  you're dirty you're ugly you're in the bad because Satan hates you because
[3:22:43.920 --> 3:22:47.920]  you're made in the image of God the creator of the universe you cannot hide
[3:22:47.920 --> 3:22:53.520]  a grand assault America is about to have his energy cut off its borders
[3:22:53.520 --> 3:22:58.840]  destroyed its dollar brought down to nothing all of you that have served
[3:22:58.840 --> 3:23:03.720]  Satan believe that you are on the right team you're about to find out how
[3:23:03.720 --> 3:23:11.400]  pathetic you are so I ask all of you who are awake and who love God stop living
[3:23:11.400 --> 3:23:17.440]  in fear the enemy is about to expose itself the enemy can't help itself
[3:23:17.440 --> 3:23:24.360]  the enemy comes to kill steal destroyer we sit here as good people get upset
[3:23:24.360 --> 3:23:29.720]  about that and stop it we should but once it comes through once it hits us
[3:23:29.720 --> 3:23:35.400]  once it's dominating us and raping us and attacking us we just have to point
[3:23:35.400 --> 3:23:40.440]  out we tried to stop it so prepare yourselves America you're going under
[3:23:40.440 --> 3:23:45.200]  judge but just like all the children that were aborted this is the truth this
[3:23:45.200 --> 3:23:49.840]  is the info water you know it's crazy to get to this point it's very better
[3:23:49.840 --> 3:23:53.600]  sweet everything we've talked about has happened just like we said it would and
[3:23:53.600 --> 3:23:56.680]  now we have a lot of credibility but I don't care about that I care about
[3:23:56.680 --> 3:24:00.280]  beating the new world order and it's because we have so much credibility they
[3:24:00.280 --> 3:24:04.160]  can't allow us to stay on air much longer and I don't have time to tell you
[3:24:04.160 --> 3:24:07.160]  all the stuff they're doing to us for a lot of reasons I can't tell you what's
[3:24:07.160 --> 3:24:10.960]  going on but let's just say this we're gonna see this through the end we're
[3:24:10.960 --> 3:24:15.280]  gonna stay on air as long as we can so please pray for us and please buy the

[3:24:30.840 --> 3:24:34.800]  that's why the globalists are censoring they can't bring in all this tyranny and
[3:24:34.800 --> 3:24:38.120]  leave people like us on the air so while you're at it don't just financially

[3:24:45.200 --> 3:24:48.720]  trying to destroy everything we ever said
[3:24:48.720 --> 3:25:16.480]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show. The answer to 1984 is 1776. It's Matt Bracken.
[3:25:16.480 --> 3:25:22.920]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show. You know a lot of people a lot of people
[3:25:22.920 --> 3:25:27.160]  would like to get my books but they don't want to participate with Amazon and I
[3:25:27.160 --> 3:25:33.680]  understand that you can also get my books using PayPal or my PO address
[3:25:33.680 --> 3:25:42.160]  anyway we're in a hard we're in a very hard spot now we are we are seeing all
[3:25:42.160 --> 3:25:49.160]  of our all of our paradigms smashed Michael Yon who's I consider really
[3:25:49.160 --> 3:25:53.800]  brilliant he's just an unusual guy his former Greenbury officer now he has
[3:25:53.800 --> 3:25:58.120]  spent decades traveling to the hellholes of the world to understand
[3:25:58.120 --> 3:26:04.800]  revolutions and civil wars and he's been doing this on a shoestring budget just
[3:26:04.800 --> 3:26:09.840]  putting out his own Michael Yon dispatches and something he said a couple of
[3:26:09.840 --> 3:26:16.120]  weeks ago that is really stuck with me is if you keep being surprised if your
[3:26:16.120 --> 3:26:21.840]  paradigm doesn't explain what you're observing then your paradigm is wrong and
[3:26:21.840 --> 3:26:27.520]  you need to scrap it and you need to come up with a new paradigm and keep
[3:26:27.520 --> 3:26:33.920]  working on it until it fits what you're observing because people tend to cling
[3:26:33.920 --> 3:26:40.520]  like those 1950s Brits clinging to the glories of a bygone Great Britain it
[3:26:40.520 --> 3:26:44.840]  didn't serve them because they were becoming a a second and then a third
[3:26:44.840 --> 3:26:52.240]  tier minor European power now they have about a quarter of the Navy of Spain the
[3:26:52.240 --> 3:26:57.200]  the Brits can barely send a destroyer to the med these days I mean it's
[3:26:57.200 --> 3:27:02.360]  absolutely pathetic but it would have helped the Brits if they had understood
[3:27:02.360 --> 3:27:06.040]  where they were going long ago they wouldn't have channeled themselves into
[3:27:06.040 --> 3:27:11.480]  socialism and becoming a welfare state you can't have a you know universal
[3:27:11.480 --> 3:27:16.200]  benefits welfare state and also be a great power they didn't understand it
[3:27:16.200 --> 3:27:20.200]  and by the time they woke up it was too late they'd important imported
[3:27:20.200 --> 3:27:25.480]  millions of people that have no love of England no love of Britain and really are
[3:27:25.480 --> 3:27:31.440]  just there for the welfare and this is the path that we're going down so Michael
[3:27:31.440 --> 3:27:39.280]  Yon is right now apparently he's got a sponsor because I watched Steve Bannon's
[3:27:39.280 --> 3:27:45.720]  War Room it's a terrific show in the morning and he's satellite videoing in
[3:27:45.720 --> 3:27:50.480]  which is very difficult and expensive from the border currently the border of
[3:27:50.480 --> 3:27:56.120]  Panama actually the bottom of the Pan American Highway because the Pan the
[3:27:56.120 --> 3:28:00.920]  Pan American Highway does not run all the way across Panama the bottom 30 30
[3:28:00.920 --> 3:28:06.240]  miles of Panama is called the Darien Gap and it's unbelievable in the 21st
[3:28:06.240 --> 3:28:11.200]  century there's no road through it it belongs to pirates and criminals and
[3:28:11.200 --> 3:28:15.840]  cartels and gangsters it's just crazy people have to either pay their way
[3:28:15.840 --> 3:28:20.000]  through it or take a boat around it but the Pan American Highway starts on the
[3:28:20.000 --> 3:28:26.520]  north end of the Darien Gap under Trump they were keeping the people were
[3:28:26.520 --> 3:28:32.760]  staying in the in in Central America they knew that they couldn't get into the
[3:28:32.760 --> 3:28:36.320]  United States if you're going to come all the way to the border of the USA and
[3:28:36.320 --> 3:28:40.840]  be stuck in a Mexican holding camp people stopped coming it wasn't worth it
[3:28:40.840 --> 3:28:45.320]  obviously we know what's happened Biden last year during the debates he said
[3:28:45.320 --> 3:28:50.200]  come on come all everybody gets you know health care education that started
[3:28:50.200 --> 3:28:55.760]  ringing the dinner bell and when he was elected people started packing now
[3:28:55.760 --> 3:29:02.800]  Michael Yan reports that in Panama the government of Panama under Trump had been
[3:29:02.800 --> 3:29:06.920]  holding people that were coming from all over the world and making their way to
[3:29:06.920 --> 3:29:13.240]  Panama we're talking about from China from Africa and and with with deals made
[3:29:13.240 --> 3:29:16.040]  with Trump they were holding them and sending them back to their home
[3:29:16.040 --> 3:29:21.360]  countries well they're now overrun because of Biden's ringing the dinner
[3:29:21.360 --> 3:29:27.840]  bell so now the government of Panama is taking old surplus American school buses
[3:29:27.840 --> 3:29:32.440]  that they have plenty of down there and they are running the immigrants the
[3:29:32.440 --> 3:29:39.360]  migrants up the length of Panama as fast as they can to the border of Guatemala
[3:29:39.360 --> 3:29:46.000]  full speed no waiting and that's happening in each country now all the way up
[3:29:46.000 --> 3:29:50.240]  to the Mexican border don't think for a minute that these people are walking
[3:29:50.240 --> 3:29:55.320]  thousands of miles to get there they're taking buses they're getting paid if
[3:29:55.320 --> 3:29:59.880]  they can't pay cash they're being raped or extorted in other ways they keep
[3:29:59.880 --> 3:30:03.760]  track of these people so that they can follow them once they're in the USA
[3:30:03.760 --> 3:30:08.680]  because a lot of these people are virtually criminal indentured servants
[3:30:08.680 --> 3:30:14.240]  when they reach the United States like for example the sex workers that were
[3:30:14.240 --> 3:30:19.240]  killed in in Georgia the other day nobody's really giving much of a dam
[3:30:19.240 --> 3:30:23.800]  about them but how did they get into the United States and what was their deal
[3:30:23.800 --> 3:30:29.640]  the fact is a lot of these massage parlor Asian girls are sex slaves that
[3:30:29.640 --> 3:30:34.760]  are brought in with a wink and a nod you're often flying in or sometimes at
[3:30:34.760 --> 3:30:40.360]  the border but they owe their they owe their tong gangs years of prostitution
[3:30:40.360 --> 3:30:45.560]  to pay for their ticket this is what the Biden administration is cooperating
[3:30:45.560 --> 3:30:52.320]  with now they're now in bed with the cartels and the Chinese tongs you know
[3:30:52.320 --> 3:30:57.960]  with the worst gangsters in humanity they're in bed and encouraging this mass
[3:30:57.960 --> 3:31:04.480]  flood and we have only seen the priming of the pump what we are seeing in the
[3:31:04.480 --> 3:31:11.240]  last couple weeks is literally the drips through the dam before the dam
[3:31:11.240 --> 3:31:18.600]  breaks open because all around the world the word has gone out America is wide
[3:31:18.600 --> 3:31:24.760]  open and if you get to America they will not kick you out you will get free
[3:31:24.760 --> 3:31:30.240]  health care free education you know free housing or subsidized housing and a
[3:31:30.240 --> 3:31:35.760]  chance for a job you'll be straight on the welfare roles and if if the
[3:31:35.760 --> 3:31:43.680]  Democrats pass HR one which is the which is the legalized the legalized
[3:31:43.680 --> 3:31:49.920]  corrupt voting act which takes the worst aspects of the 2020 election and
[3:31:49.920 --> 3:31:58.200]  makes them law if this passes 50 to 50 with Kamala Harris deciding that's
[3:31:58.200 --> 3:32:02.400]  officially the end of the United States we're not a free country anymore at that
[3:32:02.400 --> 3:32:07.920]  point we're just the U.S. essay because not one election in the future will
[3:32:07.920 --> 3:32:12.760]  matter worth one damn and and I don't know if we can stop them because they're
[3:32:12.760 --> 3:32:18.560]  talking about HR one being a civil rights matter and does the filter the
[3:32:18.560 --> 3:32:24.840]  filibuster needing meaning needing 60 votes to move a bill to a to a final
[3:32:24.840 --> 3:32:29.680]  vote if it if they get rid of the filibuster for HR one by calling it a
[3:32:29.680 --> 3:32:35.200]  civil rights law that's it we're done the country will be flooded with
[3:32:35.200 --> 3:32:41.840]  illegals estimates are a minimum of two million per year for the next two years
[3:32:41.840 --> 3:32:47.760]  before Republicans have a chance to do anything about it two million a year and
[3:32:47.760 --> 3:32:52.360]  that's a conservative estimate because these type of floods have a way of
[3:32:52.360 --> 3:32:58.240]  gaining speed and now this is going to be a huge social catastrophe in the
[3:32:58.240 --> 3:33:04.080]  United States you every town is going to be a border town a large percentage of
[3:33:04.080 --> 3:33:08.560]  these people don't speak any language that we know I mean there are there are
[3:33:08.560 --> 3:33:13.240]  Indians from Guatemala that don't even speak Spanish whole villages are coming
[3:33:13.240 --> 3:33:19.000]  up and when when these when these towns in El Salvador and Guatemala and around
[3:33:19.000 --> 3:33:23.800]  the world they're not they're not just losing excess people they're losing you
[3:33:23.800 --> 3:33:28.880]  know the baker they're losing the school teacher they're losing people that when
[3:33:28.880 --> 3:33:34.120]  they leave there's no reason for anybody else to stay so there are entire
[3:33:34.120 --> 3:33:40.160]  villages even you know towns evacuating across Latin America to come to the land
[3:33:40.160 --> 3:33:47.320]  of the free stuff and we have only seen a little trickle of what is coming I mean
[3:33:47.320 --> 3:33:52.440]  people should if we had decent news if you didn't have to watch info wars or
[3:33:52.440 --> 3:33:58.080]  ban in war room to get real news we'd know a lot more about this but we are
[3:33:58.080 --> 3:34:03.520]  like that the happy little town underneath the dam and we think that the
[3:34:03.520 --> 3:34:08.640]  dam is under control and it's just a little spillway and occasionally it's
[3:34:08.640 --> 3:34:14.400]  bigger or it's or it's thinner but the dam is about to break and this is not by
[3:34:14.400 --> 3:34:20.320]  accident this is entirely by design Matt Gates has a saying for it it's not
[3:34:20.320 --> 3:34:27.160]  any more just catch and release it's catch release and vote in HR one they're
[3:34:27.160 --> 3:34:31.880]  not they're taking citizenship out of the equation for vote for getting a vote
[3:34:31.880 --> 3:34:37.880]  they're going to send mail-in ballots to every living human that applies for any
[3:34:37.880 --> 3:34:49.000]  government service anywhere that's what's coming as men age they often

[3:36:02.960 --> 3:36:08.320]  the price for that is to carry out the orderly extermination of all carbon-based

[3:36:13.440 --> 3:36:19.000]  genetic code of the planet they are playing God they believe they have been

[3:38:41.640 --> 3:38:53.520]  today infowarstore.com you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[3:39:11.640 --> 3:39:24.440]  I'm really glad that I wrote those books starting almost 20 years ago my
[3:39:24.440 --> 3:39:29.760]  enemies trilogy in particular because I if I wrote them today I would probably
[3:39:29.760 --> 3:39:36.400]  be charged with sedition or you know trying to provoke civil disorder so if
[3:39:36.400 --> 3:39:41.440]  you write something and predict it far enough out in front hopefully in my
[3:39:41.440 --> 3:39:45.920]  case that will give me some kind of insulation because I would I would hate
[3:39:45.920 --> 3:39:51.840]  to get the you know the midnight knock on the door with the the armored car
[3:39:51.840 --> 3:39:58.000]  out front and the stormtroopers and stazis busting down the door I was in
[3:39:58.000 --> 3:40:05.200]  Washington on the 6th but I didn't get closer to the actual Capitol building
[3:40:05.200 --> 3:40:11.000]  then about a half a mile we stopped and studied it with binoculars and we could
[3:40:11.000 --> 3:40:17.720]  tell that it was just a real goat rodeo and it was going to do nobody any good
[3:40:17.720 --> 3:40:22.960]  to get any closer and now we've seen people arrested you know weeks and
[3:40:22.960 --> 3:40:27.960]  months after the event who never went into the Capitol but they were they
[3:40:27.960 --> 3:40:33.840]  were geo located because they crossed a quote-unquote geo fence where the FBI
[3:40:33.840 --> 3:40:39.400]  asks Google and your cell phone provider you know if you had crossed a
[3:40:39.400 --> 3:40:42.880]  certain street during a certain time and that's enough to get you charged now
[3:40:42.880 --> 3:40:48.840]  with a felony and what the what the feds do they do a thing called charge
[3:40:48.840 --> 3:40:57.680]  stacking there's a reason why 99% of federal criminal cases that go to court
[3:40:57.680 --> 3:41:03.160]  result in a conviction how can that be 99% really are they just that good they
[3:41:03.160 --> 3:41:08.280]  only pick really really guilty people and what they do is they charge stack so
[3:41:08.280 --> 3:41:12.920]  they've created interesting new felonies like interfering with a government
[3:41:12.920 --> 3:41:18.120]  procedure or something like that they charge you with ten overlapping crimes
[3:41:18.120 --> 3:41:22.080]  that will give you a hundred years in prison and if you want to take your
[3:41:22.080 --> 3:41:28.520]  chances on a 99% conviction rate go right ahead or you can plead it down to
[3:41:28.520 --> 3:41:33.560]  one felony charge lose your license lose your job lose your house because of
[3:41:33.560 --> 3:41:38.200]  the legal fees be a broken man and only spend a couple years in jail or
[3:41:38.200 --> 3:41:42.520]  maybe get probation kind of the Roger Stone treatment if you're willing to
[3:41:42.520 --> 3:41:47.080]  roll the dice on that go right ahead but if you lose and let's face it if
[3:41:47.080 --> 3:41:50.880]  you're if you were in the capital or near the capital you're going to be in
[3:41:50.880 --> 3:41:56.600]  front of a super liberal DC jury in front of a super liberal DC judge who's
[3:41:56.600 --> 3:42:01.400]  going to hate you by your face and your politics so who wants to take a chance
[3:42:01.400 --> 3:42:08.080]  on 99 years in prison plead it down that's the state of the Stasi America
[3:42:08.080 --> 3:42:14.840]  we live in today that's how it works now we've we have to going back to Michael
[3:42:14.840 --> 3:42:20.480]  Yon and his examination of paradigms if you're if you're constantly fooled you
[3:42:20.480 --> 3:42:24.840]  can't figure out what's going on you're in a state of confusion and befuddlement
[3:42:24.840 --> 3:42:28.520]  you can't understand what happened to your country you know all of your
[3:42:28.520 --> 3:42:35.760]  institutions are failing you the big media lies boldface like this Washington
[3:42:35.760 --> 3:42:40.340]  Post lie they got caught with the fake phone call about from Trump to the
[3:42:40.340 --> 3:42:47.120]  Georgia attorney general they just made up fake quotes quotes that got into the
[3:42:47.120 --> 3:42:52.520]  actual impeachment second impeachment trial find the fraud completely made up
[3:42:52.520 --> 3:42:58.000]  then a tape comes out months later who cares the damage is done the damage is
[3:42:58.000 --> 3:43:04.120]  done we saw this before the election the FBI had the Hunter Biden laptop for
[3:43:04.120 --> 3:43:09.280]  almost a year and they hid it they hid it during his first bogus
[3:43:09.280 --> 3:43:14.320]  impeachment over Ukraine all the exculpatory information was in Hunter
[3:43:14.320 --> 3:43:19.760]  Biden's laptop that the FBI had and they hid it during an impeachment of the
[3:43:19.760 --> 3:43:26.440]  president and then before the election when another copy of the laptop got out
[3:43:26.440 --> 3:43:32.600]  because the the computer shop owner didn't finally gave up on the FBI and
[3:43:32.600 --> 3:43:38.000]  got it to Rudy Giuliani's people and multiple copies were made big tech
[3:43:38.000 --> 3:43:43.440]  suppressed the story they buried it they spiked the New York Post's story on
[3:43:43.440 --> 3:43:51.320]  the Tony Bob Alinsky admissions about how corrupt the Bidens are so you have
[3:43:51.320 --> 3:43:55.720]  to forget regular media and I include Fox News because there's a seems to be a
[3:43:55.720 --> 3:43:59.680]  certain point that they won't tread like they they got the word right after the
[3:43:59.680 --> 3:44:04.040]  election vote fraud is off the table don't even mention it so even Fox News
[3:44:04.040 --> 3:44:10.040]  can't can't count on it that's why that's why info wars is so important
[3:44:10.040 --> 3:44:18.920]  band.video so important to share these videos now wait when going back to
[3:44:18.920 --> 3:44:22.400]  Michael Yon another thing that he has said because the guy is really brilliant
[3:44:22.400 --> 3:44:28.840]  you see me he's like a gruff grizzly bear former special forces reporter but
[3:44:28.840 --> 3:44:33.480]  and you look at him you think he's just like a street rumbler you know like a
[3:44:33.480 --> 3:44:38.320]  guy used to sleep in an attempt or in the back of a land rover somewhere in the
[3:44:38.320 --> 3:44:43.120]  third world and I'm sure he is but he comes up with some real brilliance and
[3:44:43.120 --> 3:44:48.520]  a new thing he is pushing is his concept that he has seen all over the world he
[3:44:48.520 --> 3:44:56.440]  calls it the hop principle HOP the human osmotic pressure he says no matter
[3:44:56.440 --> 3:45:00.400]  where you are whether it's you know between Ethiopia and Somalia there will
[3:45:00.400 --> 3:45:06.000]  be a human osmotic pressure and what Biden has done is pulled the filter out
[3:45:06.000 --> 3:45:11.120]  just said no filter please come and all that built-up pressure that was held
[3:45:11.120 --> 3:45:16.440]  back during the Trump years even though the wall wasn't completed just the
[3:45:16.440 --> 3:45:21.680]  site the psychological impression to the world was America's clothes they've
[3:45:21.680 --> 3:45:26.280]  made a deal of Mexico you can't cross the border and ask for asylum you're
[3:45:26.280 --> 3:45:31.720]  just gonna wind up in a Mexican refugee camp so go home this worked but the
[3:45:31.720 --> 3:45:37.920]  human osmotic pressure was building and when Biden last year announcing for the
[3:45:37.920 --> 3:45:43.920]  future we're going to have a more humane policy and now currently saying just
[3:45:43.920 --> 3:45:47.160]  don't come now but we're getting everything set in other words we're
[3:45:47.160 --> 3:45:51.560]  we're building the refugee centers we're getting ready that's not gonna stop
[3:45:51.560 --> 3:45:56.400]  people that's another ticket to ride that's another dinner bell ringing they're
[3:45:56.400 --> 3:46:01.800]  saying don't come now tells everybody boy if I don't come now I'm going to be
[3:46:01.800 --> 3:46:06.760]  way at the back of a line come now so you're at the front of the line we are
[3:46:06.760 --> 3:46:11.000]  going to see something like what happened in Europe and in particular in
[3:46:11.000 --> 3:46:17.280]  Germany in 2015 when Angela Merkel said there is no upper limit on the number of
[3:46:17.280 --> 3:46:22.120]  refugees that Germany would take no upper limit she put no number on it and
[3:46:22.120 --> 3:46:27.600]  Biden has done the same thing Biden is and his his cabinet members have said
[3:46:27.600 --> 3:46:33.400]  the same thing there is no upper limit they know if they can get all of these
[3:46:33.400 --> 3:46:39.600]  illegals in they will be voting they will be absolutely voting and the one
[3:46:39.600 --> 3:46:44.720]  thing that illegals want more than anything else more than free education
[3:46:44.720 --> 3:46:49.040]  more than free health care more than subsidized housing more than a job the
[3:46:49.040 --> 3:46:55.040]  one thing they want above all else is family reunification so the one guy
[3:46:55.040 --> 3:46:59.480]  from a family in a village somewhere in the third world who makes it to America
[3:46:59.480 --> 3:47:04.960]  and plants his flag the one thing he wants most of all is to bring the rest
[3:47:04.960 --> 3:47:10.880]  of his village his entire extended clan and he's gonna vote for the party
[3:47:10.880 --> 3:47:17.360]  absolutely a thousand percent that says open borders this is the beginning of
[3:47:17.360 --> 3:47:23.600]  the tsunami we have seen nothing yet this is the trickle through the crack in
[3:47:23.600 --> 3:47:30.960]  the dam we have not even seen what's behind the dam but it is it is coming up
[3:47:30.960 --> 3:47:36.360]  up the the pressure that osmotic pressure is building and the people are
[3:47:36.360 --> 3:47:40.840]  coming and they're coming by bus loads the countries that Trump had made deals
[3:47:40.840 --> 3:47:45.880]  with the deals are off they're not going to pay to keep people back you've seen
[3:47:45.880 --> 3:47:50.160]  the Guatemala video of those people shoving through the police they're
[3:47:50.160 --> 3:47:53.720]  not going to hold them back they're gonna put them on a bus and get them
[3:47:53.720 --> 3:47:58.320]  straight through the country as quick as possible that's what's happening
[3:47:58.320 --> 3:48:03.440]  there's there's absolutely going to be no pushback and the Republicans have no
[3:48:03.440 --> 3:48:09.760]  say in the matter absolutely zero now this is going to lead to a I think at
[3:48:09.760 --> 3:48:15.000]  some point a violent pushback by Americans normal Americans are not going
[3:48:15.000 --> 3:48:21.360]  to just sit there while bus after bus of young men are unloaded in their town
[3:48:21.360 --> 3:48:27.560]  people with no education no English and a chip on their shoulder in many cases
[3:48:27.560 --> 3:48:32.360]  there's going to be violent pushback I think I read that they're sending
[3:48:32.360 --> 3:48:37.240]  thousands to an arena in Dallas it's going to be like a a teenage male
[3:48:37.240 --> 3:48:42.760]  refugee center can you imagine how much fun that's going to be and that's just
[3:48:42.760 --> 3:48:47.640]  the first that's just a deal what's all with what's already come that's just
[3:48:47.640 --> 3:48:53.040]  dealing with the trickle the priming of the pump what's coming is a human wave
[3:48:53.040 --> 3:49:00.840]  a tsunami and Biden has no say in it his handlers are are cloured piven
[3:49:00.840 --> 3:49:07.440]  communists they want to overwhelm America they want to wreck America and this is
[3:49:07.440 --> 3:49:14.840]  just their tool for doing it just flood the country and just overrun it America
[3:49:14.840 --> 3:49:20.680]  will be ruined as a superpower the civil strife and possible civil war will be
[3:49:20.680 --> 3:49:28.200]  almost built in and on top of it hyperinflation and an economic crash what
[3:49:28.200 --> 3:49:33.440]  could be better but this is what the Democrats want it's not an accident it's
[3:49:33.440 --> 3:49:58.840]  the plan
