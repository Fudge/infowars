[00:00.000 --> 00:12.000]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.000 --> 00:30.520]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:30.520 --> 00:35.160]  well the Supreme Court ruling that just came out the last few hours is really
[00:35.160 --> 00:47.640]  bad news for gun owners you see all previous rulings by the Supreme Court
[00:47.640 --> 00:52.120]  had clearly stated that it was an absolute right to self-defense and we
[00:52.120 --> 00:56.120]  had the common law we have the state laws that you could openly carry you
[00:56.120 --> 01:02.280]  could conceal carry you could have firearms in your vehicle and then
[01:02.280 --> 01:09.720]  Chicago New York other mob boss crime systems big city you know crime systems
[01:09.720 --> 01:18.000]  banned at their quarry banned the the prey that live there from owning firearms
[01:18.000 --> 01:25.000]  to defend themselves the wolves said we want sheep that are very easy to
[01:25.000 --> 01:30.840]  basically devour we don't want men that can fight back against us and we don't
[01:30.840 --> 01:35.280]  want sheep dogs in our community who've got teeth as well so what we want is
[01:35.280 --> 01:40.760]  disarmed slaves and I heard the Violence Policy Center had on a radio show this
[01:40.760 --> 01:46.040]  morning on CBS news and I was watching some television this morning as well and
[01:46.040 --> 01:49.920]  they had the Brady campaign on and they were reading the subsections by a
[01:49.920 --> 01:55.240]  Lido and others with Republicans like this who needs Bill Clinton who needs
[01:55.240 --> 02:03.520]  Al Gore who needs the crazed sex poodle as he's now known in the media who needs
[02:03.520 --> 02:13.640]  them and I've got his quotes here noting that cities can engage in whatever
[02:13.640 --> 02:21.440]  Second Amendment restrictions they wish as well as states up and to banning
[02:21.440 --> 02:26.400]  firearms anywhere but in your home registered and locked up and they can
[02:26.400 --> 02:31.160]  restrict the type of firearms you can basically have a maybe a 22 caliber
[02:31.160 --> 02:39.360]  single-shot rifle that's locked up with a biometric key access system I mean
[02:39.360 --> 02:42.960]  that's basically what the feds are pushing for so yes if you can jump
[02:42.960 --> 02:47.960]  through a hundred flaming hoops dance on the head of a pin and then dance
[02:47.960 --> 02:58.240]  underneath a blue moon and frolic with leprechauns Easter bunnies and unicorns
[02:58.240 --> 03:05.120]  then maybe maybe if the local sheriff says okay like in New York City then
[03:05.120 --> 03:09.200]  maybe you can have a firearm if you're a Goldman Sachs executive that's ripped off
[03:09.200 --> 03:12.800]  a bunch of people and now needs one to protect themselves from all the families
[03:12.800 --> 03:17.480]  they ruined as Bloomberg reported a few months ago Goldman Sachs high-level
[03:17.480 --> 03:22.280]  employees are all being instantly given firearms permits oh you're mafia oh you
[03:22.280 --> 03:26.600]  you rob people oh you're like us sure city of New York says here's guns for you
[03:26.600 --> 03:33.080]  but not for all the regular slaves so that's how they operate so I thought I'd
[03:33.080 --> 03:37.720]  go over this justices extend the gun owner rights nationwide oh they extend
[03:37.720 --> 03:45.760]  they give it to us and so basically what they're doing is saying look these
[03:45.760 --> 03:50.320]  lower courts have said there's an absolute ban on it and no we're saying
[03:50.320 --> 03:59.760]  that if you can find the magic pass through the mountains you know if you
[03:59.760 --> 04:05.200]  can scale Mount Everest with your arms tied behind your back and with your legs
[04:05.200 --> 04:11.920]  chopped off then you may be able to get a firearm again if you can scale Mount
[04:11.920 --> 04:16.600]  Everest with your arms tied behind your back and your legs chopped off or if
[04:16.600 --> 04:22.280]  you're a Goldman Sachs executive so this is how they spend things justices
[04:22.280 --> 04:26.720]  extend gun owner rights nationwide the court was split along familiar
[04:26.720 --> 04:31.000]  ideological lines with five conservative moderate justices in favor of gun
[04:31.000 --> 04:36.280]  rights and four liberals opposed Elena Kagan's for an outright ban on the
[04:36.280 --> 04:39.320]  second amendment and she says make speech the government doesn't like
[04:39.320 --> 04:45.640]  disappear if it's for the greater good of course and she'll decide the good with
[04:45.640 --> 04:51.120]  that huge camel hump hanging beneath her neck but they've prettied her up
[04:51.120 --> 04:55.360]  though they've put some little earrings on her and a necklace and some makeup
[04:55.360 --> 04:59.080]  makes her look more nightmarish looks like John Wayne Gacy dressed up in his

[08:19.200 --> 08:29.720]  the John Wayne lookalike John Wayne Gacy lookalike that is Elena Kagan is up
[08:29.720 --> 08:37.360]  for her confirmation hearings today I could see her being confirmed to
[08:37.360 --> 08:44.320]  something like the North Korean court I could see her being confirmed if we
[08:44.320 --> 08:51.320]  could put her in a time machine to one of Joe Stalin's courts but to the
[08:51.320 --> 08:56.720]  United States Supreme Court well yes times are a changing and the way the
[08:56.720 --> 09:03.520]  corporate spin doctors work is they have a Supreme Court rule the lower courts
[09:03.520 --> 09:10.200]  cannot 100% bar citizens from owning firearms but in the words of justice
[09:10.200 --> 09:19.360]  Alito limits by no means or eliminates their ability to devise solutions to
[09:19.360 --> 09:26.120]  social problems that suit local needs and values so that's democracy if your
[09:26.120 --> 09:30.360]  local town or your state wants to completely ban your right to own guns
[09:30.360 --> 09:35.640]  and that's what the ruling states clearly then your second amendment goes
[09:35.640 --> 09:41.160]  bye-bye in a big way and that's what the violence policy center is saying
[09:41.160 --> 09:48.200]  that's what the Brady campaign to disarm the slaves campaign is saying as well
[09:48.200 --> 09:55.280]  so we're going to be covering that today again signer senators are signaling
[09:55.280 --> 09:59.720]  contentious hearing on Supreme Court nominee but Republicans are saying they
[09:59.720 --> 10:05.040]  do intend to not put up a fight blocking her confirmation but are going to raise
[10:05.040 --> 10:09.960]  issues concerning the second amendment and the first amendment because on both
[10:09.960 --> 10:15.000]  fronts she has said that she believes they can basically be restricted down to
[10:15.000 --> 10:20.760]  nothing and I think she'll fit nicely on the court because you've already had
[10:20.760 --> 10:26.440]  four of the supposed liberals narrowly being beaten by the five so-called
[10:26.440 --> 10:34.600]  conservatives and imagine four of the Supreme Court justices ruled in the
[10:34.600 --> 10:40.520]  case that was announced today but they ruled months ago that they would
[10:40.520 --> 10:48.240]  completely ban all guns in America they argued as the Attorney General argued as
[10:48.240 --> 10:53.520]  Elena Kagan has argued as Janet the butcher Waco Reno argued as Barack
[10:53.520 --> 10:58.280]  Obama as a state senator and a federal senator argued as Rahm Emanuel has
[10:58.280 --> 11:07.640]  argued for the complete and total ban on firearms for civilians that's code for
[11:07.640 --> 11:14.600]  blood bags the government's the vampires we are seen as a big Mac and fries we are
[11:14.600 --> 11:20.080]  seen as their food government's food this is how it works in most other
[11:20.080 --> 11:26.560]  nations we are slaves to them and slaves are not armed worldwide people aren't
[11:26.560 --> 11:32.560]  armed in North Korea that's an instant death sentence people weren't armed in
[11:32.560 --> 11:37.480]  Stalin's era they weren't armed under Mao Zedong or in China today it's very
[11:37.480 --> 11:44.760]  simple very elementary and so now they're teaching police nationwide with the last
[11:44.760 --> 11:52.200]  federal ruling a year ago and now this ruling yes you can have a gun in very
[11:52.200 --> 11:59.160]  rare limited situations when we give it to you as a privilege if you're a good
[11:59.160 --> 12:03.800]  little local government criminal who's retired or a Goldman Sachs executive you
[12:03.800 --> 12:07.880]  can have a boom boom and of course then you've got all the money for your own
[12:07.880 --> 12:13.160]  private security who gets special licenses we see this now where private
[12:13.160 --> 12:17.760]  securities use the G20 in Pittsburgh use in Toronto they're armed they're
[12:17.760 --> 12:21.800]  grabbing citizens off the streets all these mercenaries can do whatever they
[12:21.800 --> 12:26.000]  want the Pentagon announces they'll kill us citizens whenever they want inside
[12:26.000 --> 12:29.920]  the United States or anywhere else for that matter but you don't have a right
[12:29.920 --> 12:35.000]  to defend yourself you're meant to crawl into a ditch and die after you're done
[12:35.000 --> 12:43.400]  being bled by Big Daddy government speaking of Big Daddy I heard a reporter
[12:43.400 --> 12:50.240]  on the radio this morning on the local news quoting Senator Byrd of West
[12:50.240 --> 12:55.640]  Virginia as Big Daddy as he was known in West Virginia for bringing money into
[12:55.640 --> 13:00.160]  the state yeah government's done real good for West Virginia one of the poorest
[13:00.160 --> 13:09.640]  in the nation Big Daddy anti-gun anti sovereignty former member of the Ku Klux
[13:09.640 --> 13:15.680]  Klan but he was against an afternoon get I mean blind hogs are occasionally do
[13:15.680 --> 13:20.160]  find acres broken clocks are right twice a day but he's died of course
[13:20.160 --> 13:28.320]  the longest serving senator for over half a century he died early this morning
[13:28.320 --> 13:33.360]  and that is throwing a wrench in the financial reform bill which even the
[13:33.360 --> 13:38.600]  Washington Post admits allows the Federal Reserve unlimited power to seize
[13:38.600 --> 13:42.840]  any financial institution they wish and feed it into their criminal combine
[13:42.840 --> 13:47.360]  throw them into the woodchipper and take over all your local banking systems
[13:47.360 --> 13:52.480]  and take over your local businesses and I mean the Washington Post in their own
[13:52.480 --> 14:01.760]  analysis said unlimited authority to create any rules they wish which means
[14:01.760 --> 14:11.000]  extra legislative laws well he was the 60th vote that they needed now to have
[14:11.000 --> 14:17.960]  those 60s I guess on a spending bill or filibuster proof and now it's thrown the
[14:17.960 --> 14:26.440]  whole thing into question but I'm sure they'll get some new interim appointee
[14:26.440 --> 14:33.880]  in there we'll get up there and pull the lever for the financial dictatorship to
[14:33.880 --> 14:38.640]  fully take over the United States I mean they already they already had their
[14:38.640 --> 14:42.840]  whole body inside the tent the camel was already inside the tent we were about
[14:42.840 --> 14:46.880]  90% pushed out of the tent all our all that we had left in the tent was our
[14:46.880 --> 14:52.040]  nose so our nose was left in the tent the entire camel was in the tent but its
[14:52.040 --> 14:56.760]  tail and with this legislation now the entire camel including its tail and all
[14:56.760 --> 15:01.640]  of its manure will be inside the 10 and we will be fully outside the tent in the
[15:01.640 --> 15:07.640]  sandstorm of the global depression and for anybody that knows about Sahara
[15:07.640 --> 15:13.080]  sandstorms they can blow at a hundred and thirty miles an hour and cut the
[15:13.080 --> 15:20.880]  flesh right off your body to the bone but the Goldman Sachs bankers about to
[15:20.880 --> 15:26.360]  appoint Elena Kagan aka John Wayne Gacy I mean she literally looks like John Wayne
[15:26.360 --> 15:31.280]  Gacy it's very frightening John Wayne Gacy in drag instead of a clown outfit
[15:31.280 --> 15:36.200]  I just noticed the striking resemblance and I search engine the term and we're
[15:36.200 --> 15:40.840]  later live on TV I'm gonna I'm gonna guys am I right does she now look like
[15:40.840 --> 15:48.520]  John Wayne Gacy a little bit well yeah that's not the main photo I saw her
[15:48.520 --> 15:51.480]  where it really looks like it's where she's smiling down with the jowls
[15:51.480 --> 15:58.520]  puffing out around her like like a walrus walrus cheeks and like she has a
[15:58.520 --> 16:02.280]  hundred gallons of cream gravy and that in that almost looks like she's a
[16:02.280 --> 16:06.960]  demonic pelican and it just swings and jostles down there and then little
[16:06.960 --> 16:11.000]  government vampires come up and drink the pus gravy out of her out of her
[16:11.000 --> 16:18.800]  giant callow bag oh boy I mean what a monster ladies and gentlemen openly says
[16:18.800 --> 16:22.360]  you can disappear your speech openly says you have no right to own a gun and
[16:22.360 --> 16:26.440]  we already have four traders on the court I mean who openly say they would
[16:26.440 --> 16:33.440]  completely ban the second amendment down to nothing and I heard the Republican
[16:33.440 --> 16:37.240]  leader of the Senate on the radio this morning saying that well we're probably
[16:37.240 --> 16:42.280]  not gonna block her but we're gonna have tough questions I mean they should be
[16:42.280 --> 16:48.280]  saying no way this woman is a monster she's against our cherished first
[16:48.280 --> 16:52.520]  amendment and our cherished second amendment and our against our cherished
[16:52.520 --> 16:58.160]  fourth amendment I mean this woman is a monster a serial killer of the bill of
[16:58.160 --> 17:05.480]  rights and Constitution it's like some type of mini me of Janet Reno she does
[17:05.480 --> 17:10.640]  look like Janet Reno too I mean I don't usually judge a book by its cover but I
[17:10.640 --> 17:14.640]  mean John Wayne Gates he looks scary and so does Kagan I wonder if she dresses up
[17:14.640 --> 17:20.320]  as a demonic clown maybe we can have Phil do a quick clown job on her you know
[17:20.320 --> 17:23.720]  but he loves to think so perfectly he's a great graphics guy but just just slap
[17:23.720 --> 17:29.360]  some blue triangles on each eye and just just if I give that photograph of John

[27:34.440 --> 27:40.320]  gentlemen I apologize I just I just see the Supreme Court ruling and I read the
[27:40.320 --> 27:46.160]  actual decision and it says oh you have a right to turn your guns in you have a
[27:46.160 --> 27:51.600]  right I mean they actually say in the ruling well Chicago can basically still
[27:51.600 --> 27:55.280]  have guns be banned they've just got to allow people to have a procedure to
[27:55.280 --> 27:59.760]  attempt to go through all the regulations to maybe sometimes get a
[27:59.760 --> 28:04.240]  firearm to see the elites have decided they still want to be able to own their
[28:04.240 --> 28:10.280]  own guns so they want it nebulous enough where look I'm not gonna live as a
[28:10.280 --> 28:16.200]  slave okay I'm not gonna live so a bunch of criminal Ken lay made-off types
[28:16.200 --> 28:22.960]  can sit there and rob me blind because they think I'm stupid and I'll tell you
[28:22.960 --> 28:28.600]  it's a godsend that Robert Byrd went ahead and finally went to hell because
[28:28.600 --> 28:35.040]  and I'm I don't like to see anybody die but this will throw a monkey wrench into
[28:35.040 --> 28:39.720]  their total private fellow reserve takeover of the entire economy which
[28:39.720 --> 28:43.480]  even the Washington Post admits but in a good way they say is what is in the
[28:43.480 --> 28:47.200]  financial reform bill oh you want to get the fellow reserve back for stealing
[28:47.200 --> 28:50.560]  trillions not saying where it went well here let's just give them total control
[28:50.560 --> 28:55.080]  over every other area the economy not just banking yes and then the article
[28:55.080 --> 29:00.880]  admits six hundred trillion dollars in derivatives many experts we have on say
[29:00.880 --> 29:06.760]  it was 1.5 quadrillion a year ago that it's now two thousand trillion that's
[29:06.760 --> 29:13.120]  two quaw quadrillion used to be hard to say the billion word I'd be talking
[29:13.120 --> 29:17.400]  about billions and say millions it was thousands consequently millions
[29:17.400 --> 29:20.640]  consequently billions consequently trillions consequently quadrillions
[29:20.640 --> 29:30.720]  and then quadrillion quadrillions to quadrillion yeah we're gonna be like
[29:30.720 --> 29:34.440]  Zimbabwe ladies and gentlemen and then the government will still perch up
[29:34.440 --> 29:39.640]  there is our savior and the dim-eyed fluoride brain damage public will lick

[32:02.240 --> 32:06.600]  solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily double
[32:06.600 --> 32:10.760]  or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control
[32:10.760 --> 32:14.800]  how much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total
[32:14.800 --> 32:18.680]  government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is
[32:18.680 --> 32:22.960]  coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously
[32:22.960 --> 32:27.120]  overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the
[32:27.120 --> 32:31.440]  problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every
[32:31.440 --> 32:35.120]  year thousands of families lose their power from weather related onages number
[32:35.120 --> 32:39.320]  five a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of
[32:39.320 --> 32:42.280]  mind folks I really believe in the solar power generators offered by
[32:42.280 --> 32:45.720]  solutions from science one of my oldest sponsors you can get more information
[32:45.720 --> 32:51.520]  at www.mysolarbackup.com that's mysolarbackup.com remember the

[33:12.720 --> 33:17.600]  alright in the last hour today we've got witnesses you've been down at the G20
[33:17.600 --> 33:23.920]  slash G8 takeover of Toronto that cost 1.2 billion dollars for the three-day
[33:23.920 --> 33:30.120]  event and we've caught the police in Canada very near Toronto in Ottawa in
[33:30.120 --> 33:36.800]  Montabello a suburb of Ottawa staging attacks on their own officers we've
[33:36.800 --> 33:41.720]  got police in Seattle setting fire to their trash cans and things posing as
[33:41.720 --> 33:44.720]  anarchists we've caught them in Italy we've caught them in Greece we've caught
[33:44.720 --> 33:50.360]  them in England in London the list just goes on and on and I do have some
[33:50.360 --> 33:56.960]  reports here I've got one out of CTV news national television where it just
[33:56.960 --> 34:01.880]  describes how it's very suspicious and a lot of people are saying they believe
[34:01.880 --> 34:08.960]  it was provocateur burn a few cars then instead of the G20 getting 1.2 billion
[34:08.960 --> 34:12.960]  in security the next city they'll get 2 billion burn a couple more cars get 3
[34:12.960 --> 34:17.720]  billion and then they use that to militarize and federalize and privatize
[34:17.720 --> 34:22.760]  internationalize the local police wherever the bankers go the exact same
[34:22.760 --> 34:29.280]  phenomenon is carried out this is a staged and as fake as Elena Kagan
[34:29.280 --> 34:35.520]  wearing lipstick and earrings and Elena Kagan in drag ladies and gentlemen
[34:35.520 --> 34:47.760]  I'm gonna stop right there I just can't handle it anymore oh boy I mean these
[34:47.760 --> 34:52.360]  people are criminals they're coming for our guns they're coming for our private
[34:52.360 --> 34:56.480]  property they've already destroyed the dollar the country's dead already
[34:56.480 --> 35:03.280]  financially unless we reverse this system I told you a decade ago when they
[35:03.280 --> 35:06.680]  started selling these derivatives that it was designed to implode our economy
[35:06.680 --> 35:10.280]  and bring down the nation because I've seen it done in Latin America I've seen
[35:10.280 --> 35:15.120]  it done in Africa I've seen it done in Asia we know what these derivatives do we
[35:15.120 --> 35:19.960]  know what the IMF and World Bank does and I had all these economists on over
[35:19.960 --> 35:27.120]  the years George Humphrey and Tarpley and Dr. Paul Craig Roberts I mean Humphrey
[35:27.120 --> 35:30.480]  going back 12 years ago talking about derivatives but they really were just at
[35:30.480 --> 35:35.320]  that point making the change they had some forms of them but not as a hundred
[35:35.320 --> 35:39.600]  percent fraudulent as they are now I mean they're they're more than a hundred
[35:39.600 --> 35:43.240]  percent it I mean they don't they're not just fraudulent they're destructively
[35:43.240 --> 35:48.000]  fraudulent they're acidic they're explosive they're they're black holes
[35:48.000 --> 35:54.080]  designed to destroy economies and now it's all over the news the Wall Street
[35:54.080 --> 36:00.480]  Journal the New York Times the London Telegraph all announcing top economists
[36:00.480 --> 36:06.840]  financial analysts saying we're in a depression well a depression is three
[36:06.840 --> 36:14.960]  quarters of sustained recession with an above 20% unemployment rate that that's
[36:14.960 --> 36:18.480]  one of the classic benchmarks so the media lies the government lies and says
[36:18.480 --> 36:25.200]  we have a 9.8 my friends every private analyst every private group that looks
[36:25.200 --> 36:31.040]  at this is 22 to 25 okay it's probably about 23 to 24 but regardless it's in
[36:31.040 --> 36:39.040]  the low 20s okay that is a depression and here is the New York Times today Paul
[36:39.040 --> 36:44.160]  Krugman the third depression is the headline we are now I fear in the
[36:44.160 --> 36:47.520]  early stages of a third depression it will probably look more like the long
[36:47.520 --> 36:52.080]  depression than the much more severe great depression but the cost to the
[36:52.080 --> 36:56.200]  world economy and all to millions of lives blighted by the absence of jobs
[36:56.200 --> 37:01.600]  will nonetheless be immense and I agree with Krugman let's hope it's a Japanese
[37:01.600 --> 37:11.640]  style long depression that they've had since the late 80s let's let's hope that
[37:11.640 --> 37:18.240]  it is something similar to what we've seen in Japan in the last 20 years let's
[37:18.240 --> 37:23.840]  hope it's just a long sustained degeneration because a full-on total
[37:23.840 --> 37:28.000]  collapse will be explosive and that is unfortunately what is starting to
[37:28.000 --> 37:33.280]  shape up I hope this is the case and a lot of evidence shows it tending towards
[37:33.280 --> 37:36.440]  this because the country was so wealthy there is so much still private
[37:36.440 --> 37:39.360]  property it'll take a long time for the government to steal it all and give it
[37:39.360 --> 37:43.160]  offshore banks but you can better believe things are going to be a lot
[37:43.160 --> 37:49.800]  worse for all Americans from here on out because just like Greece we are run by
[37:49.800 --> 37:55.280]  criminals the same crooks and we are not saying no to the tyranny like Iceland
[37:55.280 --> 37:58.760]  we are not saying no to the tyranny like other nations have done we are going
[37:58.760 --> 38:04.120]  straight down it's like we have bowling ball cement shoes and the American
[38:04.120 --> 38:06.920]  people are sitting on the dock is a hundred foot deep water right off the
[38:06.920 --> 38:13.960]  dock and we're putting on huge lead cannonball shoes and I'm saying look
[38:13.960 --> 38:17.200]  you don't want to jump in the water I mean you really want to take those shoes
[38:17.200 --> 38:23.040]  off it's dangerous to be on a dock wearing 50 pound lead shoes 50 pounds
[38:23.040 --> 38:26.320]  a piece if you fall in the water you're gonna shoot to the bottom you are going
[38:26.320 --> 38:31.280]  to die do not put those on stop it stop it world government's bad letting
[38:31.280 --> 38:36.480]  foreign banks take over and run things as bad these people are crooks made off
[38:36.480 --> 38:41.080]  as one of their top minions look out look out you're like I'll show you
[38:41.080 --> 38:47.280]  conspiracy theorist as you put the lead shoes on and jump in the water here's a
[38:47.280 --> 38:51.400]  better analogy it's like a long dock out in the middle of a frigid lake a hundred
[38:51.400 --> 38:56.880]  feet deep and we've watched all these third world countries be held down and
[38:56.880 --> 39:03.640]  have the globalist fit the bowling ball cannonball lead weight shoes on them and
[39:03.640 --> 39:08.240]  throw them off the dock and then now the same bankers have walked up to us and
[39:08.240 --> 39:13.560]  invited us out on the dock in 1913 and the last 97 years have been the long
[39:13.560 --> 39:18.200]  walk out to the end of the dock and now with the October takeover and the
[39:18.200 --> 39:24.080]  trillion stolen they fitted the bowling balls lead weights on our shoes and now
[39:24.080 --> 39:27.720]  they've got us stood up on the edge of the dock and we can see bubbles coming
[39:27.720 --> 39:32.720]  up from the last you know countries thrown into the frigid icy water and
[39:32.720 --> 39:37.400]  I'm on the shore of the bullhorn saying no no don't struggle fight back don't
[39:37.400 --> 39:40.400]  let them throw you over and the government looks at you and says be
[39:40.400 --> 39:44.720]  trendy be cool I don't want to have to call you a racist I don't want to have
[39:44.720 --> 39:47.800]  to call you a terrorist and the American people are looking at the bankers saying
[39:47.800 --> 39:54.040]  throw me in then in fact can I can I lick your boots first and the bankers
[39:54.040 --> 39:57.880]  like sure go ahead and lick my boots a little before I shove you into the water
[39:57.880 --> 40:02.840]  and I'm gonna shove your children in too you're like oh thank you government thank
[40:02.840 --> 40:07.800]  you I'm so domesticated I love everything you do to me it's so much fun oh
[40:07.800 --> 40:10.200]  thank you
[40:12.520 --> 40:17.520]  why does this have to happen why do we have to be ruled by crooks and scam
[40:17.520 --> 40:21.760]  artists and fraudsters why are we letting them openly trying the police to
[40:21.760 --> 40:26.800]  take on gun owners and landowners why why are we so pathetic because from the
[40:26.800 --> 40:34.040]  time of being children set in front of the television to crap our diapers the
[40:34.040 --> 40:38.720]  American people have been drinking sodium fluoride and eating GMO food and and
[40:38.720 --> 40:43.720]  and being injected full of mercury and viruses and everything else that's in the
[40:43.720 --> 40:49.120]  vaccines and we have been taught to value football and baseball and dramas
[40:49.120 --> 40:53.880]  and sitcoms and Hollywood and we've been caught to act like little children and
[40:53.880 --> 40:57.800]  giggle and laugh and go to the bar every night and get drunk and never have a
[40:57.800 --> 41:03.360]  care in the world we're not serious our ancestors gave us milk and honey our
[41:03.360 --> 41:08.600]  ancestors gave us a promised land our ancestors gave us the Gutenberg press and
[41:08.600 --> 41:13.960]  private property and liberty and free men owning arms and now we have squandered
[41:13.960 --> 41:23.080]  it all away we have sold our birthright for a bowl of soup a bowl of soup but the
[41:23.080 --> 41:29.480]  new world order has poisoned we have given it all the way in fraud let me use
[41:29.480 --> 41:35.800]  a more modern analogy it's like the new Rumpelstilzken Shrek 3 where Shrek
[41:35.800 --> 41:41.240]  gives it all the way to the slick talking Rumpelstilzken and I have to sit
[41:41.240 --> 41:45.040]  here and know that our government's far worse than the fictitious Rumpelstilzken
[41:45.040 --> 41:53.920]  I have to sit here and watch a army of of of demonic pelicans you know just just
[41:53.920 --> 42:00.080]  just drunk on our blood having their way with us and I for one am sick of these
[42:00.080 --> 42:05.400]  people we need to hate them we need to disdain them we need to beat the drum
[42:05.400 --> 42:10.560]  that they are illegitimate criminals and if we just keep beating that drum and
[42:10.560 --> 42:16.040]  never shut up and face the horror of what we've been incrementally snugged into
[42:16.040 --> 42:20.360]  I mean we've dug our own graves we're in the grave now the new world are
[42:20.360 --> 42:24.600]  standing above us urinating on us and I for one am sick of it that didn't rain
[42:24.600 --> 42:31.680]  ladies and gentlemen okay oh now I've got a headache I mean this is really
[42:31.680 --> 42:35.240]  upsetting me okay I don't even want to be here at the show today I mean this is
[42:35.240 --> 42:39.720]  so horrible and makes me so angry that I probably eat shouldn't even be on the
[42:39.720 --> 42:43.160]  air today because I'm really worried about what I'm gonna say and what I'm
[42:43.160 --> 42:50.520]  gonna do I'm gonna be honest with you I mean I'm mad and and you should be mad
[42:50.520 --> 42:55.560]  too because that is evidence of the fact that your brain your psyche your
[42:55.560 --> 43:01.920]  spirit your soul knows that we're in trouble we're in trouble we're in trouble
[43:01.920 --> 43:07.920]  we've got a press of police state hanging over us to enforce at gunpoint the
[43:07.920 --> 43:14.040]  robberies that are taking place by these corrupt feudal lords that are over us
[43:14.040 --> 43:17.440]  now I'm gonna give you the phone number and we're gonna take your phone calls and
[43:17.440 --> 43:28.360]  just I'm gonna take a lot of them 1-800-259-9231 1-800-259-9231 is the
[43:28.360 --> 43:35.960]  toll-free number to join us worldwide here my friends the good news is there
[43:35.960 --> 43:40.400]  is a big awakening happening people are getting serious they are focusing and
[43:40.400 --> 43:43.600]  that's why the establishment is openly now saying yes we're gonna have kill
[43:43.600 --> 43:47.160]  switches yes we're gonna control ISPs yes we're gonna block what you can see
[43:47.160 --> 43:50.400]  yes we're taking over the web yes it's Chinese style control that's
[43:50.400 --> 43:57.000]  Lieberman's own words it's all happening it's all happening they know
[43:57.000 --> 44:03.560]  you're arising they know you found your legs they know you're wiping the sleep
[44:03.560 --> 44:07.560]  out of your eyes spiritually psychologically physically they can
[44:07.560 --> 44:13.560]  hear your engine fire up like a 450 horsepower hemi and they can hear that
[44:13.560 --> 44:18.200]  roar coming through those pipes and they are scared ladies and gentlemen and so
[44:18.200 --> 44:22.040]  they're gonna start World War 3 with Iran they're gonna hammer the economy
[44:22.040 --> 44:26.400]  down I mean I was reading this morning where there's Taiwanese giant skimmers
[44:26.400 --> 44:32.040]  that one ship that they've been offering us for over a month and a half that's
[44:32.040 --> 44:35.800]  been waiting that this one ship can remove more oil a day than all the
[44:35.800 --> 44:41.320]  other ships involved that's why Obama blocked the Dutch the Norwegians the
[44:41.320 --> 44:46.800]  Taiwanese they've got these mega ships and it's confirmed that they're never
[44:46.800 --> 44:51.280]  going to let them help they're never gonna let the cities and counties and
[44:51.280 --> 44:55.200]  states I heard the governor this morning in Mississippi where it's finally
[44:55.200 --> 44:58.840]  hitting the estuaries and the bays and they could have just simply blocked it by
[44:58.840 --> 45:02.360]  putting sand berms up but the but the environmentalists said no they're not
[45:02.360 --> 45:05.440]  environmentalists they're feudal lords you understand that it's about them
[45:05.440 --> 45:10.360]  telling you if you can wipe your hind in it's about the government for you to
[45:10.360 --> 45:13.680]  breathe you got to pay a tax to these people you understand we always joke
[45:13.680 --> 45:19.000]  about may I have permission to breathe yes you got to pay us a carbon tax on
[45:19.000 --> 45:24.840]  that because you're exhaling a poison as Bill Gates said that's why I put an
[45:24.840 --> 45:28.960]  image of humans up on the screen at the Ted convention two months ago and said
[45:28.960 --> 45:34.000]  we've got a lower this down to zero to stop the carbon everybody laughed all
[45:34.000 --> 45:39.800]  the globalist it's like we're talking about mass killing no one will get it
[45:39.800 --> 45:45.760]  they're so stupid when they watch this on internet and I'm supposed to sit here
[45:45.760 --> 45:49.320]  as a red-blooded male I mean I'm red-blooded folks I mean isn't everybody
[45:49.320 --> 45:54.080]  like me I know a lot of you out there are I know growing up in high school and
[45:54.080 --> 45:58.200]  college I ran into a lot of people where I lived in North Texas that if you
[45:58.200 --> 46:00.960]  looked at them wrong they start trying to beat the daylights out of you and
[46:00.960 --> 46:03.880]  boy let me tell you you better fight them with everything you had or you're
[46:03.880 --> 46:07.600]  gonna go to the hospital it was you or them what I mean how can you get a man
[46:07.600 --> 46:11.520]  fighting mad if somebody says something smart mouthed their girlfriend or
[46:11.520 --> 46:14.920]  somebody cuts them off in traffic but but these people can poison your water
[46:14.920 --> 46:19.280]  poison your food steal your whole future debase your currency rob you through
[46:19.280 --> 46:22.880]  inflation and you can't get angry because you're under a spell you're under
[46:22.880 --> 46:27.080]  mind control what's a secret society that's a thousand-year-old name for an
[46:27.080 --> 46:33.100]  intelligence agency what's a spell a spell is just mind control a spells a
[46:33.100 --> 46:38.000]  mind trick hypnotized a game you're in a trance folks look I'm not a trance
[46:38.000 --> 46:44.000]  okay how am I who's red-blooded how am I a red-blooded person not supposed to
[46:44.000 --> 46:51.160]  get angry here how am I not supposed to be crazed with concern and animating
[46:51.160 --> 46:58.720]  energy to resist these people we're a nation of lazy slugs myself included we
[46:58.720 --> 47:02.680]  always pass the job on to somebody else we always pass the initiative on to
[47:02.680 --> 47:06.360]  somebody else we always wait till tomorrow and then wait till next week
[47:06.360 --> 47:11.720]  and then wait till next year there isn't time there isn't time there isn't time
[47:11.720 --> 47:18.440]  it's worse than I thought and I have confirmed there is no doubt that since
[47:18.440 --> 47:26.640]  April 20th how many days is that guys do the calculator what's 28 days or the
[47:26.640 --> 47:32.040]  28th day of June and then what was it 30 days in May or 31 I forget let's just
[47:32.040 --> 47:43.160]  say 30 and 20 so so how many days is that how many days since the oil spill
[47:43.160 --> 48:00.400]  what's 28 30 and 20 how many 78 days 78 days
[48:02.880 --> 48:10.040]  two and a half months 78 days that's happened and you've got all vanguard the
[48:10.040 --> 48:13.480]  president's own mutual fund we're almost all his money's invested his 10 million
[48:13.480 --> 48:20.480]  plus dollars you've got Goldman Sachs dumping 44% of their stock you got the
[48:20.480 --> 48:28.880]  CEO of BP dumping 33 plus percent over a third is what the media reported you've
[48:28.880 --> 48:33.640]  got all these other funds just dumping BP in the week before you've got the
[48:33.640 --> 48:37.640]  strange modification that was done on the wellhead two hours before it blew up
[48:37.640 --> 48:41.880]  you've got all the secrecy you've got the engineers on board who are on record
[48:41.880 --> 48:46.720]  in the Coast Guard trial they had almost a month ago the Coast Guard hearing
[48:46.720 --> 48:50.120]  saying they had told them months before this was going to cause an explosion and
[48:50.120 --> 48:53.800]  the wellhead indeed already ruptured weeks before and they gave them more
[48:53.800 --> 49:00.480]  orders that they said would cause an explosion a lot of times in the global
[49:00.480 --> 49:03.440]  estate something they just give someone an order that they know will cause a
[49:03.440 --> 49:07.280]  chain reaction then there's plausible deniability and then if that wasn't
[49:07.280 --> 49:12.960]  enough for at least 70 days of the 70 eggs I remember a week into it there
[49:12.960 --> 49:17.960]  were counties there were states there was the cities they were out there
[49:17.960 --> 49:21.240]  knowing that especially Louisiana with those estuaries where most their fishing
[49:21.240 --> 49:25.880]  goes on you know huge marshlands huge brackish areas full of shrimp and fish
[49:25.880 --> 49:30.800]  and where a lot of their fishing goes on and the Fed said you know what 10 miles
[49:30.800 --> 49:35.480]  in we now declare as federal 10 miles into land you can't block his first they
[49:35.480 --> 49:38.120]  try to block right out of the ocean they say no you're not blocking that at the
[49:38.120 --> 49:42.280]  ocean they'd have ways for the fish to swim around out of the brackish areas it
[49:42.280 --> 49:46.120]  would just it would just have a break line in front so they could you know
[49:46.120 --> 49:52.320]  catch the oil there and the Fed said no and then Dutch and Taiwanese and other
[49:52.320 --> 49:56.680]  ships arrived giant ships designed for this that could scoop up one of these
[49:56.680 --> 50:07.880]  things they were reporting could pump in 50,000 barrels a day 50,000 barrels a
[50:07.880 --> 50:13.240]  day by one estimate I've seen that one ship can get about 10% of the oil coming
[50:13.240 --> 50:19.120]  out each day and there's scores there's more than 30 ships of similar type these
[50:19.120 --> 50:22.200]  new modern mega ships that could come and could already be here and doing this
[50:22.200 --> 50:25.360]  over a month ago and the government says no we're not gonna get rid of the
[50:25.360 --> 50:31.440]  Jones Act for an emergency waiver for Gulf relief they could do instantly no
[50:31.440 --> 50:35.800]  we're not gonna let the counties and states fix it no these are tariffed and
[50:35.800 --> 50:39.480]  you know why they can't wait till the first hurricane comes into the Gulf
[50:39.480 --> 50:43.720]  thank God Alex turned away towards Mexico they can't wait until it drives
[50:43.720 --> 50:48.800]  those hundreds of millions of gallons of oil up onto our beaches and they get to
[50:48.800 --> 50:52.600]  declare an emergency and pass their stinking carbon tax oh you don't want
[50:52.600 --> 50:56.200]  their carbon tax they're gonna teach you a lesson they blew that oil well and
[50:56.200 --> 51:00.840]  they can't wait for that oil to come ashore and you're not gonna stop global
[51:00.840 --> 51:05.080]  meltdowns massive unemployment endless wars a new currency crisis
[51:05.080 --> 51:09.800]  financially and morally bankrupt a great and terrible storm is approaching so

[54:32.000 --> 54:35.720]  Wonderland that the wicked queen would wear her head looks like something out
[54:35.720 --> 54:39.880]  of Beetlejuice you know the shrunken head people I mean it doesn't look like

[54:53.360 --> 54:59.280]  looks smaller than her hands they just showed a shot of her and I'm actually
[54:59.280 --> 55:03.600]  starting to have hallucinations looking at her and she is sitting there with this
[55:03.600 --> 55:10.880]  arrogant angry look on her face even as other senators grovel to her and I've
[55:10.880 --> 55:15.200]  never seen anyone in a confirmation hearing look like this she has an
[55:15.200 --> 55:23.120]  arrogant stance wearing a giant clown outfit she is unable to smile and they've
[55:23.120 --> 55:28.000]  tried to dollar up a bit which makes her only look more cartoonish but again I
[55:28.000 --> 55:30.720]  don't care how she looks ladies and gentlemen that's not the issue that this
[55:30.720 --> 55:36.200]  woman is a tyrant this woman worships this Israeli judge who judge Bork called
[55:36.200 --> 55:39.640]  the worst judge on the world who believes judges should make law and rule as
[55:39.640 --> 55:44.080]  tyrants this woman is anti-second amendment on anti free speech I mean
[55:44.080 --> 55:50.240]  what more do I have to say you've heard the quotes I've never this country is
[55:50.240 --> 55:54.520]  going to hell in a handbasket I just can't handle it anymore we were gonna
[55:54.520 --> 55:58.920]  go to Wayne and from 1380 a.m. in Tennessee but he just hung up and Derek

[56:02.320 --> 56:08.360]  us is 1-800-259-9231 here let's fit up a little bit this audio right now of Lord
[56:08.360 --> 56:13.720]  Kagan our new ruler we can all agree that your decisions will impact society long
[56:13.720 --> 56:18.920]  after you have left the court justice Oliver Wendell Holmes put it plainly and
[56:18.920 --> 56:25.000]  I quote presidents come and go but the Supreme Court goes on forever that's
[56:25.000 --> 56:29.520]  why it is so important for and guys is it just me or is she like in a stare down
[56:29.520 --> 56:34.640]  with the senators like like like the Chicago mob has told him look you're
[56:34.640 --> 56:40.240]  all gonna vote for her we're gonna tell folks about what she did last summer I
[56:40.240 --> 56:46.360]  mean she I have never seen this woman is a dictator I mean she is just swollen
[56:46.360 --> 56:51.520]  does she not look swollen and like she's on a power trip up there is there
[56:51.520 --> 56:58.200]  no end to the humiliation that this country has to go through you know the
[56:58.200 --> 57:01.320]  government makes us do things that seem absurd because once they've trained you
[57:01.320 --> 57:05.200]  to do something absurd you'll pull it up with anything I mean I have to sit here
[57:05.200 --> 57:12.440]  and watch this woman with a scowl on her face hatefully stare down the Senate
[57:12.440 --> 57:17.120]  that she has total contempt for she can't wait to be on that court for 30 40
[57:17.120 --> 57:21.200]  years that's why they're putting her in there she's young literally never done
[57:21.200 --> 57:29.400]  anything but been a government bureaucrat and a minion I can't believe the way
[57:29.400 --> 57:33.760]  she's looking at these people I guess she's been told she can do whatever she
[57:33.760 --> 57:39.520]  wants I'm surprised she doesn't just never mind let's fade up the audio a
[57:39.520 --> 57:45.120]  little bit more here to a test of judicial excellence and your nomination
[57:45.120 --> 57:49.480]  will be no different first the nominee must demonstrate that she has the
[57:49.480 --> 57:54.280]  competence character integrity and temperament necessary for any judge or
[57:54.280 --> 57:59.840]  justice they put her forward as a joke not only put her forward as a joke on
[57:59.840 --> 58:04.840]  us but also willing to decide cases with an open mind I can't look at her
[58:04.840 --> 58:08.120]  anymore to get it off screen I'm serious it's driving me into a rage right now

[01:00:10.560 --> 01:00:18.640]  well so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from
[01:00:18.640 --> 01:00:24.920]  Austin Texas Alex Jones well senator Byrd of West Virginia lost his
[01:00:24.920 --> 01:00:33.400]  tenuous grasp to this plane of existence I wonder what tunnel he went down or up
[01:00:33.400 --> 01:00:38.760]  down the black tunnel up the glistening white tunnel you think senator Byrd's
[01:00:38.760 --> 01:00:44.320]  brought a little white angel wings and flapped up to Valhalla or do you think
[01:00:44.320 --> 01:00:50.880]  he's now dining with Beelzebub so he's gone a specter who looks like he's the
[01:00:50.880 --> 01:00:54.000]  walking dead is getting ready to ask Kagan questions the next 10-15 minutes
[01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:59.520]  I'm gonna cut to that feed because it'll be a parting gasp from specter thrown out
[01:00:59.520 --> 01:01:04.520]  in the primary another stab at the heart of America he stabbed the country in the
[01:01:04.520 --> 01:01:11.760]  heart so many times the Supreme Court has ruled that governments have a right
[01:01:11.760 --> 01:01:16.560]  to take your guns now the public is running around going I we got our right
[01:01:16.560 --> 01:01:21.720]  the government gave it to us we won we won nobody's got guns in DC a year and
[01:01:21.720 --> 01:01:26.800]  a half after they over through that nobody's got guns in other areas of the
[01:01:26.800 --> 01:01:31.320]  country where they've disarmed their quarry what what this does is it says
[01:01:31.320 --> 01:01:35.680]  look you just can't outright say there's no second amendment yes you can write
[01:01:35.680 --> 01:01:42.480]  regulations that make it impossible to own guns and that's what Alito said so I
[01:01:42.480 --> 01:01:46.080]  guess with people like Alito why not just have Kagan in there just have it done
[01:01:46.080 --> 01:01:49.960]  with I mean have her openly run around wallowing on the second amendment the
[01:01:49.960 --> 01:01:53.160]  first amendment you got both the government already moving to shut down
[01:01:53.160 --> 01:01:57.120]  the internet publicly I mean let's just get real here let's just call it what it
[01:01:57.120 --> 01:02:02.000]  is let's call a spade a spade it's tyranny all right we're gonna come back
[01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:04.760]  from break this is a short segment and I promise I'm gonna go directly your
[01:02:04.760 --> 01:02:10.600]  calls it was shaking me up looking at Kagan though I mean I don't like looking
[01:02:10.600 --> 01:02:17.160]  at tyrants and I can't stand looking at male tyrants female tyrants but there's
[01:02:17.160 --> 01:02:21.800]  something archetypal archetypal about the goblin witch the you know the image
[01:02:21.800 --> 01:02:30.280]  of just a thug a usurper a nobody just dredged up out of the bottom of a
[01:02:30.280 --> 01:02:34.800]  cesspit and then stuck in a blue dress up there in front of us
[01:02:34.800 --> 01:02:40.000]  festooned with pearls who literally has had everything given to her in her life
[01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:46.440]  because she's a tyrant and it was a complete cog a complete machine a
[01:02:46.440 --> 01:02:53.360]  wind-up toy a robot of tyranny who in every writing praises judges in foreign
[01:02:53.360 --> 01:02:58.200]  countries that are known as global superstars of tyranny and judicial
[01:02:58.200 --> 01:03:04.640]  oppression I mean it's just it's unbelievable how unqualified she is how
[01:03:04.640 --> 01:03:10.000]  pathetic she is how tyrannical she is it's a joke I'm like Robbie the robot
[01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:13.080]  where I can't compute something and smoke just starts coming out of my ears at
[01:03:13.080 --> 01:03:17.480]  this point I just can't handle it anymore and I know you can't handle it
[01:03:17.480 --> 01:03:22.280]  anymore but we got to be smart we got to be cold and we've got to apply
[01:03:22.280 --> 01:03:25.720]  ourselves every day to take back our cities our counties our states and the
[01:03:25.720 --> 01:03:30.000]  federal government so we can kick these parasite new world order people out of
[01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:33.680]  our country so we can get the rule of law on the bill of rights and
[01:03:33.680 --> 01:03:37.800]  constitution back so these mega corporations and big central banks that
[01:03:37.800 --> 01:03:41.280]  have carried out all these crimes can be brought to justice because we're not
[01:03:41.280 --> 01:03:47.120]  going to have any rest or any freedom or any liberty or any chance at a free
[01:03:47.120 --> 01:03:52.120]  life I mean it I always wanted freedom folks that's why I got involved at you
[01:03:52.120 --> 01:03:56.440]  know 21 in the fight for liberty when most people were out chasing skirts and
[01:03:56.440 --> 01:04:01.760]  getting drunk I've done a little bit of that and it wasn't fulfilling I knew
[01:04:01.760 --> 01:04:06.000]  liberty was under attack but let me tell you when I started having children in
[01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:11.480]  the last eight and a half years things totally changed a whole new dimension
[01:04:11.480 --> 01:04:18.000]  of outrage and disgust entered my psyche and I will not have my children
[01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:23.600]  being slaves of groups of criminals that combine forces together with all their
[01:04:23.600 --> 01:04:31.240]  fancy PR to sell slavery down my throat I will not be your slave I don't care
[01:04:31.240 --> 01:04:36.480]  if you give me toilet water and tell me it's lemonade I know what it is and I'm
[01:04:36.480 --> 01:04:41.240]  not drinking it Kagan I'm not drinking it Obama I'm not drinking it Mitt Romney

[01:04:50.320 --> 01:04:55.360]  want you out of my life you parasites do you understand you degenerate scum we

[01:08:13.920 --> 01:08:22.520]  the champion of the new world order died today as they bring forth another
[01:08:22.520 --> 01:08:32.080]  enabler of evil and tyranny Elena Kagan we're gonna be covering that
[01:08:32.080 --> 01:08:36.720]  throughout the broadcast in fact let's just fade up let's just fade up the
[01:08:36.720 --> 01:08:43.720]  hearing here for people again for just a moment and here's some of the groveling
[01:08:43.720 --> 01:08:47.520]  that's going on towards her what's important to the Republicans and what
[01:08:47.520 --> 01:08:51.040]  is important to the Democrats when it comes to our judiciary and who sits on
[01:08:51.040 --> 01:08:55.920]  it absolutely and the suggestion that came from senator Sessions the lead
[01:08:55.920 --> 01:08:59.840]  Republican on the judiciary committee is that she is potentially an activist
[01:08:59.840 --> 01:09:04.840]  judge and he was very interesting he's know he said but other people who have
[01:09:04.840 --> 01:09:09.360]  served in political life in America before becoming a Supreme Court nominee
[01:09:09.360 --> 01:09:14.280]  for example Chief Justice Roberts worked for Ronald Reagan for example but he
[01:09:14.280 --> 01:09:16.920]  said there's a difference here and the difference is that she was actually
[01:09:16.920 --> 01:09:22.120]  involved in the domestic policy advocacy and there you get into issues like
[01:09:22.120 --> 01:09:25.760]  partial birth abortion and he said specifically that she was the one who
[01:09:25.760 --> 01:09:30.320]  convinced Clinton to veto such a ban on partial birth abortion yeah that's
[01:09:30.320 --> 01:09:33.680]  enough they've cut away from the hearings we go to C-span if we want to hear
[01:09:33.680 --> 01:09:43.400]  them but she openly says that judges in writings that we've read on air you've
[01:09:43.400 --> 01:09:47.680]  seen it in the news it's been all over the web she's written published papers
[01:09:47.680 --> 01:09:51.400]  these aren't emails to friends these aren't now these are published law
[01:09:51.400 --> 01:09:57.760]  papers where she believes judges should make law I mean right there this would
[01:09:57.760 --> 01:10:04.960]  be like putting an alcoholic in charge of a liquor store oh Bob you know you're
[01:10:04.960 --> 01:10:09.240]  57 years old you've been drinking since you were 12 you're a complete alcoholic

[01:11:01.760 --> 01:11:07.920]  marvel when Federal Reserve had Treasury had brokerage firm heads one after the
[01:11:07.920 --> 01:11:11.520]  other the last year and a half get up before Congress and say we won't tell

[01:11:14.680 --> 01:11:19.640]  it and then one congressman Stern says to Paulson he says well what about the
[01:11:19.640 --> 01:11:23.800]  218 million you got when you were Treasury Secretary you gave that to
[01:11:23.800 --> 01:11:27.880]  yourself through Goldman Sachs and he said well I gave myself a waiver and the
[01:11:27.880 --> 01:11:31.400]  congressman said you gave yourself a waiver and he said yeah I gave myself a

[01:11:42.480 --> 01:11:46.680]  openly announcing they're going to start taking over the internet and by the
[01:11:46.680 --> 01:11:49.880]  way the media is all talking about Obama and a kill switch he can kill the
[01:11:49.880 --> 01:11:52.880]  internet they're not going to kill the internet with flipping a switch they're
[01:11:52.880 --> 01:11:57.200]  gonna slowly take it over federalize it and start incrementally censoring it we

[01:12:18.160 --> 01:12:22.200]  attacks on the web Kurt Nemo wrote an article almost a year ago at info wars
[01:12:22.200 --> 01:12:26.760]  dot com where the Pentagon admitted they run attacks on their own systems they're
[01:12:26.760 --> 01:12:31.040]  going to attack it shut it down for a few days then turn it back on and say see
[01:12:31.040 --> 01:12:35.400]  you were scared but we ended up saving the internet and they're also saying in
[01:12:35.400 --> 01:12:40.600]  these hearings the head of cyber command which is by the way Pentagon
[01:12:40.600 --> 01:12:45.600]  involved domestically it's totally illegal Richard Clark he's now got his

[01:13:30.320 --> 01:13:35.160]  here we are it's now we watch nations going under the banks we watch the
[01:13:35.160 --> 01:13:40.160]  roads and water and 600 islands of Greece being handed over to the very banks
[01:13:40.160 --> 01:13:44.600]  that robbed them we openly see them raising taxes everywhere we openly see
[01:13:44.600 --> 01:13:52.880]  the news now admitting this is a depression by design I mean this is the
[01:13:52.880 --> 01:13:56.160]  full-on war they're going to start the wars they're going to state the terror
[01:13:56.160 --> 01:13:59.880]  attacks they're going to block the oil relief so that it can come ashore and
[01:13:59.880 --> 01:14:03.840]  create a devastating emergency this is the order out of chaos this is the
[01:14:03.840 --> 01:14:07.920]  wrecking of society and in the big corporations that control government
[01:14:07.920 --> 01:14:12.160]  they've got all the private firms in banking and oil cleanup in law
[01:14:12.160 --> 01:14:16.400]  enforcement in military hardware in military training that then make the
[01:14:16.400 --> 01:14:23.400]  profit out of the collapse and managing every collapse until you are totally
[01:14:23.400 --> 01:14:28.160]  bankrupt under their control and then they're going to launch the next phase
[01:14:28.160 --> 01:14:32.400]  global extermination operations with the u.s. supplying the battle-hardened
[01:14:32.400 --> 01:14:35.880]  murdered forces because there won't be any other jobs for your sons your
[01:14:35.880 --> 01:14:40.160]  daughters will be prostitutes and whores or will be little police officers and
[01:14:40.160 --> 01:14:44.080]  your sons will all be off fighting for the new world order empire coming back
[01:14:44.080 --> 01:14:49.480]  with their arms and legs blown off that's what the future of America all
[01:14:49.480 --> 01:14:51.720]  right I'm done I'm done I'm done
[01:14:51.720 --> 01:14:58.320]  yeah Derek in New Mexico you're on the air go ahead Alex I just wanted to briefly
[01:14:58.320 --> 01:15:03.040]  discuss a couple topics on smart meters in California digital license plates in
[01:15:03.040 --> 01:15:08.000]  California and he but first the smart meters I think that this is going to be
[01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:12.280]  a way to control marijuana growing now that they know that the voters in
[01:15:12.280 --> 01:15:16.080]  California want marijuana they want to figure out a mechanism even if the
[01:15:16.080 --> 01:15:20.600]  year-end tuition is correct they already said that they're using smart
[01:15:20.600 --> 01:15:25.080]  meters in Austin Texas and in areas of California to track if you're using more
[01:15:25.080 --> 01:15:28.320]  power than the number of people that live in the house and then that's used
[01:15:28.320 --> 01:15:32.720]  as evidence for a SWAT team warrant and they've rated people that are growing
[01:15:32.720 --> 01:15:36.800]  plants or have a bunch of fish tanks or are into a bunch of televisions right
[01:15:36.800 --> 01:15:39.920]  here in Austin and they keep on the lowdown but they're already looking at
[01:15:39.920 --> 01:15:44.240]  your power bill but it's more than that all the new dishwashers all the new
[01:15:44.240 --> 01:15:48.720]  toasters all the new refrigerators all the new clothes dryers all the new
[01:15:48.720 --> 01:15:53.480]  computers by federal regulations have smart meter hookups in them or
[01:15:53.480 --> 01:15:56.640]  everything is going to be tracked and even you're outside air condition is
[01:15:56.640 --> 01:16:00.040]  going to be radio remote controlled where the government controls everything
[01:16:00.040 --> 01:16:04.480]  going on inside your house and yes all the license plates worldwide the feds
[01:16:04.480 --> 01:16:08.040]  are moving globally because it's one big federal government worldwide remember
[01:16:08.040 --> 01:16:13.720]  these banks that yes government messages about anti-gun anti-family pro-prosack
[01:16:13.720 --> 01:16:18.000]  are going to be all and then soon your car by law as part of a tax the entire
[01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:20.880]  door panels are going to be government brought brainwashing where you're
[01:16:20.880 --> 01:16:24.480]  totally immersed in government brainwashing because they cannot allow
[01:16:24.480 --> 01:16:28.080]  you to unplug from the television they've got to gram them cram them down your
[01:16:28.080 --> 01:16:32.880]  throat the Pentagon said 20 years ago the model will be what time square looks
[01:16:32.880 --> 01:16:37.240]  like we're just everything is bombarding you with face scanning cameras that then
[01:16:37.240 --> 01:16:42.720]  flash adds up Taylor made to you individually I'm sorry go ahead and I
[01:16:42.720 --> 01:16:47.080]  just wanted to this is like Al Capone style because the way he did it was look
[01:16:47.080 --> 01:16:50.440]  if you want to be able to purchase weed you're gonna have to come to me that's
[01:16:50.440 --> 01:16:54.280]  what he did or he would blow them smithereens if they didn't and the
[01:16:54.280 --> 01:16:58.160]  digitalized no that's it no that's on record they legalize the pot first that
[01:16:58.160 --> 01:17:02.960]  Obama comes into California and and the feds order them you will cut 1500 pot
[01:17:02.960 --> 01:17:07.360]  stores down to 50 and then those are all run by local have phase and then and
[01:17:07.360 --> 01:17:11.520]  then there's still so there's not enough legal pot areas to supply all the weed
[01:17:11.520 --> 01:17:15.640]  so you have a government-controlled limited just like with diamonds or oil
[01:17:15.640 --> 01:17:19.480]  cartel and then you have separately the black market and they shake everybody
[01:17:19.480 --> 01:17:24.600]  down on both ends of it people like taking snarling at us just like you were
[01:17:24.600 --> 01:17:28.360]  saying earlier I had to turn the channel myself because I couldn't stand saying
[01:17:28.360 --> 01:17:32.320]  how the the woman just snarls and Chris Matthew this morning talking about gun
[01:17:32.320 --> 01:17:36.600]  control talking about that even in the old west that you had to check your guns
[01:17:36.600 --> 01:17:41.760]  at the at the city gates that's not true people used to walk around all the
[01:17:41.760 --> 01:17:46.600]  time there was only a few cities during really bad times it was generally a
[01:17:46.600 --> 01:17:49.360]  corrupt sheriff who would do that because a lot of times the sheriffs
[01:17:49.360 --> 01:17:51.360]  became the real outlaws
[01:17:51.360 --> 01:17:54.640]  well albuquerque now yesterday i live in the city of albuquerque and they're
[01:17:54.640 --> 01:17:58.880]  um really person is dwy gender forward they're saying now that you can be
[01:17:58.880 --> 01:18:02.400]  arrested at your home for dwy
[01:18:02.400 --> 01:18:05.760]  uh... even if they happen a month previously that they need to be able to
[01:18:05.760 --> 01:18:07.760]  follow up and investigate
[01:18:07.760 --> 01:18:10.360]  and that they have that uh... on the news the other day
[01:18:10.360 --> 01:18:13.640]  well let me go back to all the central point she made there because you really
[01:18:13.640 --> 01:18:15.760]  have brought up some thought-provoking points
[01:18:15.760 --> 01:18:19.080]  i mean for those that didn't watch it and i i literally had to turn it off i've
[01:18:19.080 --> 01:18:21.560]  never seen anybody not a general
[01:18:21.560 --> 01:18:22.640]  not a
[01:18:22.640 --> 01:18:23.800]  uh...
[01:18:23.800 --> 01:18:26.760]  uh... court nominee
[01:18:26.760 --> 01:18:28.600]  not a cabinet official
[01:18:28.600 --> 01:18:32.040]  i've never seen anyone with this crazed a look
[01:18:32.040 --> 01:18:35.320]  literally snarling with hatred this woman
[01:18:35.320 --> 01:18:38.760]  that's why i'm saying a writing she is a monster
[01:18:38.760 --> 01:18:41.160]  but i mean you saw what i was talking about
[01:18:41.160 --> 01:18:42.040]  you know
[01:18:42.040 --> 01:18:45.200]  before you even said i was in here watching i was tell my wife i cannot
[01:18:45.200 --> 01:18:47.880]  believe the way that she's just not only i could turn the channel
[01:18:47.880 --> 01:18:51.200]  and i hear you go on about it and you can hear like a comedian
[01:18:51.200 --> 01:18:53.600]  i've been listening for years on the twenty six-year-old
[01:18:53.600 --> 01:18:57.160]  uh... latin american male regardless of what people say about the uh...
[01:18:57.160 --> 01:18:59.240]  tea party movement about the conservative
[01:18:59.240 --> 01:19:00.280]  i'm conservative
[01:19:00.280 --> 01:19:03.160]  and we know what's going on and we're not going to let them sit there and and
[01:19:03.160 --> 01:19:05.760]  try to put two different people against each other one
[01:19:05.760 --> 01:19:09.520]  when our views are exactly the same you know and i want to thank you for the
[01:19:09.520 --> 01:19:12.800]  work that you've done and i've opened many people's eyes you know what i mean
[01:19:12.800 --> 01:19:14.400]  within my community
[01:19:14.400 --> 01:19:17.840]  and uh... and i'm on and i can't stand this tyranny they're putting us in
[01:19:17.840 --> 01:19:19.440]  and uh... i bless you
[01:19:19.440 --> 01:19:22.800]  the e-books that they're coming out with this is a way to delete history
[01:19:22.800 --> 01:19:26.320]  because when they convert everything to digital media and then all of a sudden
[01:19:26.320 --> 01:19:28.400]  then the lieberman can have a kill switch
[01:19:28.400 --> 01:19:31.760]  and then they erase history so what i've done is i've been printing out
[01:19:31.760 --> 01:19:34.720]  everything that i've ever once known and been buying books so that you can have
[01:19:34.720 --> 01:19:36.160]  that physically
[01:19:36.160 --> 01:19:39.520]  home and i would advise people to do that because that's a point because they
[01:19:39.520 --> 01:19:42.560]  they've actually done the studies that within about ten years
[01:19:42.560 --> 01:19:47.200]  almost all book publishers will not make books anymore unless it's a bestseller
[01:19:47.200 --> 01:19:50.240]  and so you won't be able to get a physical copy and then over time they
[01:19:50.240 --> 01:19:54.240]  can edit and change the books i agree with you folks
[01:19:54.240 --> 01:19:57.840]  oh my god i appreciate your call derrick we're gonna come back and go to jim marg
[01:19:57.840 --> 01:20:00.560]  dan alex and others
[01:20:00.560 --> 01:20:03.040]  you worry but only because you're paying attention
[01:20:03.040 --> 01:20:06.560]  what's happening in the Gulf of Mexico illustrates an audacity toward nature
[01:20:06.560 --> 01:20:10.400]  a similar audacity called gmo or genetically modified organisms means
[01:20:10.400 --> 01:20:14.080]  that the quality of commercially grown food may be compromised with our health
[01:20:14.080 --> 01:20:17.360]  in the balance now that summer's here what better time to learn about the
[01:20:17.360 --> 01:20:20.640]  bounty that nature provides in wild edible food
[01:20:20.640 --> 01:20:24.560]  let author linda runyon show you the best kept secret in plain sight
[01:20:24.560 --> 01:20:27.760]  that food is everywhere you look this summer for the cost of a good meal or
[01:20:27.760 --> 01:20:31.120]  two out you can literally starvation proof yourself and or loved ones against
[01:20:31.120 --> 01:20:34.240]  any future craziness and put up tons of free food too
[01:20:34.240 --> 01:20:37.760]  whatever experiment is being run on us you can rest assured that linda's 50 or
[01:20:37.760 --> 01:20:41.520]  so staple foods aren't involved our foods are their enemy

[01:26:18.160 --> 01:26:21.920]  amendment you know is a right for the militias and that's the national guard
[01:26:21.920 --> 01:26:26.480]  and uh that she supports uh she was she was making policy in the clinton
[01:26:26.480 --> 01:26:30.000]  administration she supported partial birth abortion she supported the assault
[01:26:30.000 --> 01:26:33.520]  weapons ban i mean she's she's anti second amendment and she's made
[01:26:33.520 --> 01:26:38.400]  statements saying that she agrees uh with attorney general uh holder
[01:26:38.400 --> 01:26:41.520]  uh who argued that you can pull up his quotes saying there's no individual
[01:26:41.520 --> 01:26:44.720]  right to keep their arms which is the u n position
[01:26:44.720 --> 01:26:48.720]  uh which obama now says he supports i mean you can pull those quotes up
[01:26:48.720 --> 01:26:52.080]  okay i want to say one thing in defense of my wife
[01:26:52.080 --> 01:26:59.680]  okay she got me uh romanian ak-47 for valentine's day because nothing says love
[01:26:59.680 --> 01:27:04.480]  like an assault weapon now now she got you some type of mac 90 variant right it's
[01:27:04.480 --> 01:27:10.480]  semi-automatic no no no no it was a romanian ak
[01:27:10.480 --> 01:27:17.360]  so so the rifle's fully auto no no it's semi-auto but it's legal
[01:27:17.360 --> 01:27:21.600]  no i understand let me i only reason i correct you and i'm sure your wife's a
[01:27:21.600 --> 01:27:24.400]  great lady i mean she's probably a really nice person
[01:27:24.400 --> 01:27:28.080]  and and really intelligent and so truth is stranger than fiction
[01:27:28.080 --> 01:27:31.520]  she'll see us troubled believing it you know even until the end of world war
[01:27:31.520 --> 01:27:34.000]  two the average american and our media did
[01:27:34.000 --> 01:27:37.440]  said that they didn't believe hitler had death camps because people just couldn't
[01:27:37.440 --> 01:27:41.040]  imagine a western society doing something like that
[01:27:41.040 --> 01:27:44.160]  um because they'd known about it happening in other parts of the world
[01:27:44.160 --> 01:27:46.800]  and they were naive thinking oh we're so civilized
[01:27:46.800 --> 01:27:50.560]  you know we can't do anything uh like that here but after the war
[01:27:50.560 --> 01:27:53.600]  uh it you know it came out what had really happened
[01:27:53.600 --> 01:27:58.240]  eisenhower made the germans clean up the camps and actually bury the people
[01:27:58.240 --> 01:28:02.880]  because even the local towns were in denial about what was going on
[01:28:02.880 --> 01:28:08.800]  so so i mean denial is a serious uh force but uh specifically though i see the
[01:28:08.800 --> 01:28:13.920]  media always lying saying you can go to the gun show and buy an ak-47 a
[01:28:13.920 --> 01:28:17.520]  collision a cough and then they'll show an image of it
[01:28:17.520 --> 01:28:20.960]  uh and then the media goes wow you can get fully auto
[01:28:20.960 --> 01:28:25.440]  russian weapons and they use that against us and and yes i understand in a
[01:28:25.440 --> 01:28:29.200]  figure of speech it is the body of an ak-47
[01:28:29.200 --> 01:28:33.360]  it is that classic uh look and i've got a bulgarian
[01:28:33.360 --> 01:28:39.040]  a romanian a chinese a russian but they've all got different names because
[01:28:39.040 --> 01:28:42.480]  just like a it looks like an m16 but it's not fully
[01:28:42.480 --> 01:28:46.160]  auto it's an ar-15 and there's hundreds of
[01:28:46.160 --> 01:28:51.440]  different variants a fully auto you'll cult m16
[01:28:51.440 --> 01:28:55.120]  you have to get a federal firearms stamp a license
[01:28:55.120 --> 01:28:58.560]  to get that uh so if you bought it at a gun show
[01:28:58.560 --> 01:29:03.120]  or at a gun shop uh and i had a lot of times
[01:29:03.120 --> 01:29:07.360]  atf tricks good people at gun shows and sends them to prison this is a trick
[01:29:07.360 --> 01:29:12.160]  they'll show up get a get a gun dealing stand
[01:29:12.160 --> 01:29:16.240]  and say come on over here i got a fully auto ak-47
[01:29:16.240 --> 01:29:21.600]  and you know farmer john uh who's there all the time
[01:29:21.600 --> 01:29:26.480]  at the gun show he sees these same guns he goes wow yeah a hundred dollars that's
[01:29:26.480 --> 01:29:30.000]  a good deal they're 300 over at that table go ahead and
[01:29:30.000 --> 01:29:33.440]  give me the cash here so you want the ak-47 right
[01:29:33.440 --> 01:29:37.040]  and then they sent him to prison and so your wife bought you a
[01:29:37.040 --> 01:29:40.960]  variant of a ak-47 the semi-automatic
[01:29:40.960 --> 01:29:44.560]  street legal version which is what you want to begin with you don't want
[01:29:44.560 --> 01:29:48.800]  full auto uh you want single shot that's the way to direct your rounds

[01:33:49.760 --> 01:33:55.280]  state authorities fix the berms and i would get emails saying you're making
[01:33:55.280 --> 01:33:59.200]  that up obama's a great guy you republicans are going to get it
[01:33:59.200 --> 01:34:02.320]  and i see youtube comments on videos i put out about the subject
[01:34:02.320 --> 01:34:06.240]  i'm not a republican you know you got to love it whenever bush was in power
[01:34:06.240 --> 01:34:09.760]  people send me emails going you stinking democrat you're not going to get away
[01:34:09.760 --> 01:34:14.960]  with this you hardcore economy and then obama comes in and it's you listen
[01:34:14.960 --> 01:34:18.080]  you're not going to get away with you republican racist
[01:34:18.080 --> 01:34:22.000]  what on earth does blocking the estuaries have to do with being a
[01:34:22.000 --> 01:34:27.600]  republican or a democrat or a racist and now it's all over the news again
[01:34:27.600 --> 01:34:33.520]  that they have these giant skimmer ships one ship from taiwan
[01:34:33.520 --> 01:34:41.200]  can scoop up more oil than all of the ships we've got out there currently
[01:34:41.200 --> 01:34:48.480]  and it just sucks the oil in skims the water out and sprays the water back out
[01:34:48.480 --> 01:34:54.160]  the back and keeps the oil and they go off and refine it
[01:34:54.160 --> 01:34:58.240]  and by the way these ship companies have offered to do it for free
[01:34:58.240 --> 01:35:01.520]  and how can they do that all they want to do is be able to keep the oil
[01:35:01.520 --> 01:35:05.360]  they've done the mathematical calculations that if they can go out and
[01:35:05.360 --> 01:35:09.840]  scoop x amount of oil they will make huge profits that's the free market
[01:35:09.840 --> 01:35:15.600]  you let them have the oil let's see no no no bp gets to get the cleanup money
[01:35:15.600 --> 01:35:19.200]  bp gets to pay part of the 20 billion to its own subsidiaries
[01:35:19.200 --> 01:35:23.040]  to clean up the mess they're gonna end up making money off this
[01:35:23.040 --> 01:35:28.640]  this is a chicago mafia operation teamed up with the dc new york mob
[01:35:28.640 --> 01:35:31.840]  they're going to let this disaster be as bad as it can
[01:35:31.840 --> 01:35:35.440]  to pass their carbon taxes but that's coming up let's go back to your calls
[01:35:35.440 --> 01:35:39.200]  it's just it's so horrible and now there's more and more mainstream news
[01:35:39.200 --> 01:35:44.400]  articles talking about evacuations of the gulf having to happen
[01:35:44.400 --> 01:35:47.440]  but i'm what i'm gonna do is i'm gonna take calls for us the hour now

[01:36:11.520 --> 01:36:17.200]  with a crazed hateful steel-eyed uh look in their eye like kegan i mean this
[01:36:17.200 --> 01:36:20.800]  woman cannot wait to slap the american people around
[01:36:20.800 --> 01:36:24.560]  and uh she knows that the botan paid for senate is going to crouch down and
[01:36:24.560 --> 01:36:28.640]  follow their orders and so she's standing there in a queenly
[01:36:28.640 --> 01:36:34.240]  uh bearing just letting them know that you are my slaves but go ahead
[01:36:34.240 --> 01:36:38.480]  and i know you that's crazy uh i'm not gonna let that
[01:36:38.480 --> 01:36:41.840]  get me off track um these are those guys in the g20
[01:36:41.840 --> 01:36:46.160]  i'm saying like you said to the guy in prison go with god guys and i know they
[01:36:46.160 --> 01:36:49.280]  will and i wanted to ask a couple questions about that
[01:36:49.280 --> 01:36:53.120]  was a neat interview with uh ventura and a couple things in
[01:36:53.120 --> 01:36:56.480]  arizona i want to ask about and and i'll be brief
[01:36:56.480 --> 01:37:00.560]  um the governor situation i don't know much about i'm not able to follow
[01:37:00.560 --> 01:37:03.680]  everything but the governor in arizona i want to
[01:37:03.680 --> 01:37:07.360]  compare an example of what ventura shared on your show
[01:37:07.360 --> 01:37:11.840]  um several years ago when he was the servant of the
[01:37:11.840 --> 01:37:16.640]  people who have authority in minnesota and um
[01:37:16.640 --> 01:37:21.280]  he shared that when those people those black-suited
[01:37:21.280 --> 01:37:28.080]  um you know cia george soros whatever people came in to his
[01:37:28.080 --> 01:37:31.920]  organization or in his into the capital and told him to come downstairs he told
[01:37:31.920 --> 01:37:36.720]  him what is your business and what are your names
[01:37:36.720 --> 01:37:39.360]  and they said well let us tell you something he said no you're not telling
[01:37:39.360 --> 01:37:43.440]  me anything i serve the people of this state and you get out of here
[01:37:43.440 --> 01:37:49.360]  and this uh this arizona thing i hate to say it but it's it's going to get to a
[01:37:49.360 --> 01:37:52.720]  point eventually where there's going to have to be a force of the people
[01:37:52.720 --> 01:37:55.360]  and that's the only way because these other these you know our government's
[01:37:55.360 --> 01:37:58.080]  not doing a darn thing they're you know they're they're messing the whole
[01:37:58.080 --> 01:38:00.320]  thing up no i mean the southwest is in complete
[01:38:00.320 --> 01:38:03.600]  collapse mexico has collapsed it is a failed state
[01:38:03.600 --> 01:38:06.960]  there's mass murder going on 80 plus miles in
[01:38:06.960 --> 01:38:09.600]  they're putting up signs saying don't drive down this road don't go in this
[01:38:09.600 --> 01:38:12.960]  national park i mean the country is falling apart
[01:38:12.960 --> 01:38:16.240]  which is exactly what the establishment wants because then the banks come in
[01:38:16.240 --> 01:38:20.080]  and take over we are being overthrown we are being
[01:38:20.080 --> 01:38:23.760]  destroyed just like they'll bomb out belgrade and come in and take it over
[01:38:23.760 --> 01:38:26.080]  bomb out bag dead and come in and take it over
[01:38:26.080 --> 01:38:31.120]  this is their modus operandi uh and arizona is literally making a last
[01:38:31.120 --> 01:38:35.680]  alamo stand against a third world country collapsing into it
[01:38:35.680 --> 01:38:38.880]  nothing against mexico folks but i mean it is collapsed
[01:38:38.880 --> 01:38:44.560]  this is a red alert 46 states are going bankrupt according to bloomberg
[01:38:44.560 --> 01:38:50.240]  red alert the ship is sinking we are on fire
[01:38:50.240 --> 01:38:55.200]  and you've got you've got some goblin woman in a giant
[01:38:55.200 --> 01:38:59.680]  clown suit i mean a big blue clown suit looks like she's got to have a clown car
[01:38:59.680 --> 01:39:03.600]  up there scowling at everyone with her tiny pinhead
[01:39:03.600 --> 01:39:07.840]  it's just surreal i mean i mean and that's the psychological tactic they just
[01:39:07.840 --> 01:39:12.880]  want to overwhelm us think about obama arrogantly sitting there
[01:39:12.880 --> 01:39:15.920]  knowing that between 50 and 100 million gallons
[01:39:15.920 --> 01:39:19.920]  conservatively is going to blow up we're into day 78 on this
[01:39:19.920 --> 01:39:23.600]  for 70 plus days of this he's been blocking it and they know it's going to
[01:39:23.600 --> 01:39:26.400]  come in when the hurricane's hitting the next few months
[01:39:26.400 --> 01:39:30.160]  can be even sooner they know it's going to blow most that
[01:39:30.160 --> 01:39:32.800]  end to the coast and it's going to be a disaster
[01:39:32.800 --> 01:39:35.920]  a biblical proportions and then he's going to grandstand then and he's going
[01:39:35.920 --> 01:39:39.680]  to he thinks you're going to forget that he blocked the aid
[01:39:39.680 --> 01:39:44.000]  and then his answer will be putting a new tax on you i mean they are trying to
[01:39:44.000 --> 01:39:47.200]  wreck this country their banks are trying to bring us down i appreciate
[01:39:47.200 --> 01:39:51.760]  your call mark i mean it's just so hard to deal with i mean
[01:39:51.760 --> 01:39:55.840]  i understand why new listeners don't want to believe me i can't believe this
[01:39:55.840 --> 01:39:59.280]  okay i can't believe we have even if we had a corrupt
[01:39:59.280 --> 01:40:02.640]  elite you'd think they want to keep their possession their property
[01:40:02.640 --> 01:40:07.120]  the united states in place and and and run it well
[01:40:07.120 --> 01:40:10.080]  you know i mean if i was the corrupt ruling elite of the system
[01:40:10.080 --> 01:40:13.600]  i would try to have healthy people strong people i'd try to still have private
[01:40:13.600 --> 01:40:17.120]  property because i can milk more off of them you know with a big government
[01:40:17.120 --> 01:40:20.480]  through that no no no no no they want to wreck it
[01:40:20.480 --> 01:40:24.080]  they want to fully dominate and drive everyone to submission
[01:40:24.080 --> 01:40:27.840]  because they want power they don't want you living good
[01:40:27.840 --> 01:40:31.120]  you look into the eyes of kagan and you see everything that these socialist
[01:40:31.120 --> 01:40:35.120]  globalist parasites are about she is there and she doesn't care
[01:40:35.120 --> 01:40:38.800]  the power elites put her into control and she has nothing but arrogance and
[01:40:38.800 --> 01:40:43.520]  contempt for those senators i've never seen anything like it
[01:40:43.520 --> 01:40:47.920]  she is a monster because she believes in overthrowing those elected representatives
[01:40:47.920 --> 01:40:51.280]  she believes in the dictatorship of the judiciary
[01:40:51.280 --> 01:40:55.120]  she is a one-worlder she's a baby killer folks
[01:40:55.120 --> 01:41:00.000]  she's a monster she thinks that women aren't told when they're nine months
[01:41:00.000 --> 01:41:02.240]  pregnant they're ignorant when they go into a planned
[01:41:02.240 --> 01:41:05.280]  parenthood oh we could adopt your baby and cps would even
[01:41:05.280 --> 01:41:08.640]  pay hundreds of thousands or cps would get hundreds of thousands of dollars
[01:41:08.640 --> 01:41:12.000]  you know normally we'd have to kidnap your child go ahead and have the child
[01:41:12.000 --> 01:41:16.560]  no their prerogative is kill kill kill even if there's money involved
[01:41:16.560 --> 01:41:20.000]  they'd still kill that baby and so they're like sure we'll get you taken care of
[01:41:20.000 --> 01:41:23.840]  there's a special doctor and they'll kill a baby two weeks from term
[01:41:23.840 --> 01:41:27.920]  kill it out on the table that's the dirty secret so to giving it to a family
[01:41:27.920 --> 01:41:31.040]  that wants it and always these fake liberals you're
[01:41:31.040 --> 01:41:34.960]  not liberals you're monsters you're lovers of death
[01:41:34.960 --> 01:41:38.160]  with death and hatred for all mankind in your heart and you know it
[01:41:38.160 --> 01:41:40.880]  i remember back in high school and college i debated when they'd say
[01:41:40.880 --> 01:41:46.400]  are you as a white person gonna gonna adopt these brown and black babies i
[01:41:46.400 --> 01:41:50.080]  never understood that line and now i know the statistics i know that there
[01:41:50.080 --> 01:41:53.120]  are liberal groups pushing to keep whites from actually adopting
[01:41:53.120 --> 01:41:57.360]  hispanic and black babies that people don't want or even retarded black
[01:41:57.360 --> 01:42:01.360]  babies oh yes oh yes instead of them being aborted
[01:42:01.360 --> 01:42:05.280]  because it sets that deadly evil precedent and and and devalues
[01:42:05.280 --> 01:42:08.880]  their lives and it turns out there are more people wanting to adopt each year
[01:42:08.880 --> 01:42:12.800]  than there are abortions that's why people import babies in from the
[01:42:12.800 --> 01:42:18.000]  middle east asia south korea africa
[01:42:18.000 --> 01:42:21.440]  that's why there's white christians down there fighting to adopt starving
[01:42:21.440 --> 01:42:24.960]  Haitian children and the establishment says you're not gonna adopt them
[01:42:24.960 --> 01:42:28.160]  you're gonna go to prison even though they got all the authorizations
[01:42:28.160 --> 01:42:31.760]  you're gonna let that baby starve to death notice you don't hear about Haiti
[01:42:31.760 --> 01:42:35.920]  anymore hundreds and hundreds over 200 000 dead
[01:42:35.920 --> 01:42:39.760]  thousands still dying a week total collapse of their society collapse of
[01:42:39.760 --> 01:42:42.640]  all their major buildings collapse of their capital building collapse of
[01:42:42.640 --> 01:42:46.560]  their white house total collapse oh you don't hear about anymore
[01:42:46.560 --> 01:42:49.920]  and nobody's gonna be able to adopt those black babies i'm afraid they're
[01:42:49.920 --> 01:42:54.480]  going to die because these people aren't liberals
[01:42:54.480 --> 01:43:01.360]  folks they're nazi eugenicist scum dan in minnesota you're on the year
[01:43:01.360 --> 01:43:07.040]  afternoon alex hello uh yeah i live in minnesota here and uh two weeks ago on
[01:43:07.040 --> 01:43:11.040]  the news um they had uh the churches had a they have a nice

[01:43:15.440 --> 01:43:19.680]  Protestant churches they have them in austin and i saw video in austin
[01:43:19.680 --> 01:43:23.120]  of people out on the street corner saying hey i'll buy your guns i'll pay more
[01:43:23.120 --> 01:43:26.480]  than the fifty dollar certificate and the cops came over
[01:43:26.480 --> 01:43:30.640]  the local Austin activists and said we don't have a law but we're just saying
[01:43:30.640 --> 01:43:34.160]  you're not going to be here soliciting this get out of here
[01:43:34.160 --> 01:43:37.600]  because again it's about training everybody the image of turning your guns
[01:43:37.600 --> 01:43:40.160]  in as a good civic thing go ahead
[01:43:40.160 --> 01:43:43.840]  yeah and uh i'm the guy uh who called in a few weeks ago i don't know if you
[01:43:43.840 --> 01:43:47.520]  remember about my ex-wife uh working in the sheriff's department
[01:43:47.520 --> 01:43:51.280]  uh with the vaccine given my son the vaccines and the fluoride and all that
[01:43:51.280 --> 01:43:54.480]  stuff yeah i uh i talked to her about that
[01:43:54.480 --> 01:43:58.720]  and uh she just basically said i need to uh be i gave her all the articles gave
[01:43:58.720 --> 01:44:03.360]  her the actual vaccine inserts um the last time i had my son i told him what
[01:44:03.360 --> 01:44:07.520]  aspartame fluoride does and he he knows that uh what various
[01:44:07.520 --> 01:44:10.560]  tarot is is all about him he's he's a smart seven-year-old
[01:44:10.560 --> 01:44:13.440]  what's your wife like your ex-wife thinks she's rebelling and she's like i'm
[01:44:13.440 --> 01:44:16.480]  going to give him that fluoride and i'm going to give them those shots and
[01:44:16.480 --> 01:44:19.120]  there's nothing you're going to do to stop me dan
[01:44:19.120 --> 01:44:23.200]  i buy into the whole system because it smiles at me and paths me on the head
[01:44:23.200 --> 01:44:26.400]  dan yeah she uh she said i basically need to be
[01:44:26.400 --> 01:44:30.000]  locked up in a mental mental institution she said shut up conspiracy theorists
[01:44:30.000 --> 01:44:34.240]  and that was her answer well at least your salvaging your son
[01:44:34.240 --> 01:44:37.760]  but i guess she's now trying to cram him full of fluoride and stuff
[01:44:37.760 --> 01:44:42.240]  yeah yeah pretty much and of course the court smiled on her and gave her to him
[01:44:42.240 --> 01:44:46.000]  because she'll do what the system says huh exactly
[01:44:46.000 --> 01:44:49.760]  well how old's your son he's seven he'll be eight here in a month you need to
[01:44:49.760 --> 01:44:53.680]  explain to him just say look don't rebel against mommy because
[01:44:53.680 --> 01:44:57.120]  the way they program women today she'll she'll teach you she'll put you on
[01:44:57.120 --> 01:45:00.560]  prozac and ritalin and brain damage you and it's part of a female
[01:45:00.560 --> 01:45:05.680]  form of child abuse and men do it too but particularly females
[01:45:05.680 --> 01:45:09.280]  it's about showing the young male whose boss and these women actually at a
[01:45:09.280 --> 01:45:11.920]  subconscious level get off on wrecking their sons
[01:45:11.920 --> 01:45:15.120]  say don't rebel against her she's dangerous do whatever she says
[01:45:15.120 --> 01:45:19.600]  at least on the surface be nice to her lover she she's mommy's sick
[01:45:19.600 --> 01:45:24.080]  and uh and and just you know she'll pour you the fluoride water
[01:45:24.080 --> 01:45:30.400]  take a little sip act like you're drinking it uh and uh
[01:45:30.400 --> 01:45:33.440]  up front if he just drinks the poison at first she'll think she's dominated and
[01:45:33.440 --> 01:45:37.120]  then he can quietly filter it or get some healthier water the bottle stuff's
[01:45:37.120 --> 01:45:41.360]  even worse than the tap uh on average and then
[01:45:41.360 --> 01:45:44.960]  because if he rebels she's gonna come in with more shots she'll give him every
[01:45:44.960 --> 01:45:48.880]  and when he has seizures she won't she won't care she'll just
[01:45:48.880 --> 01:45:52.560]  she'll just get deeper into it and just accelerate the evil
[01:45:52.560 --> 01:45:55.840]  because a lot of women love guinea pig and their kids they it's like a cult of
[01:45:55.840 --> 01:45:58.160]  worshiping the doctors i'm sorry go ahead
[01:45:58.160 --> 01:46:02.480]  yeah i did go on dr mccullough's website and he had a legal action there where
[01:46:02.480 --> 01:46:07.040]  you can actually press charges assault with a deadly weapon uh through um
[01:46:07.040 --> 01:46:11.920]  laws if she gives them vaccine yeah i know some people had to do that um
[01:46:11.920 --> 01:46:14.960]  again you might just try to sweet talk her before you get into a bunch of
[01:46:14.960 --> 01:46:19.920]  legal action i mean so she wouldn't even read mainstream news articles that uh
[01:46:19.920 --> 01:46:23.680]  i mean admit that the swine flu was a hoax in his deadly or that garter sales
[01:46:23.680 --> 01:46:26.960]  killing all these women i mean i sent her a million articles i even talked to her
[01:46:26.960 --> 01:46:30.400]  boy said what the nazis use it for go back and read history i'm not going to
[01:46:30.400 --> 01:46:33.680]  read that it's it you can find anything on the internet
[01:46:33.680 --> 01:46:36.960]  it it really doesn't matter you you just print off whatever you want to make me
[01:46:36.960 --> 01:46:40.720]  believe it shut up conspiracy theorists
[01:46:41.280 --> 01:46:44.720]  and and and i mean does she run after every new shot that comes out and just
[01:46:44.720 --> 01:46:47.680]  takes him to the doctor like a cult member injecting him
[01:46:47.680 --> 01:46:51.520]  uh pretty much yeah i don't mind i mean that that i that i find out about he'll
[01:46:51.520 --> 01:46:54.720]  tell me i mean she won't tell me a thing but i think it's important i'm not
[01:46:54.720 --> 01:46:58.080]  blaming you because nobody's perfect but i think when you first get with a woman
[01:46:58.080 --> 01:47:01.520]  you know me it's and that's why for four years and i'm a failure i'm just going
[01:47:01.520 --> 01:47:04.720]  to say that right now i'm a failure i could have probably
[01:47:04.720 --> 01:47:07.520]  really helped a lot of people i have not been able to launch a social network
[01:47:07.520 --> 01:47:11.760]  for four years that works okay that's how pathetic i am okay if somebody big
[01:47:11.760 --> 01:47:14.800]  company wants to make one give it to me no strings attached will do it
[01:47:14.800 --> 01:47:18.160]  just so i can have a thing for meetup so patriots can get together
[01:47:18.160 --> 01:47:21.920]  to meet each other you know to form families i mean that'd be a small part
[01:47:21.920 --> 01:47:25.120]  of the whole operation of what i was going to do but we're just incapable
[01:47:25.120 --> 01:47:29.600]  of it and uh at least at this point and
[01:47:29.600 --> 01:47:33.200]  because it's dangerous i mean you need to know if you've got a bootlicker who
[01:47:33.200 --> 01:47:35.360]  worships the system when you get with them
[01:47:35.360 --> 01:47:38.800]  because i couldn't imagine having a wife that just was dumbered in a box of rocks
[01:47:38.800 --> 01:47:42.240]  and wouldn't even look at information about vaccines and i see these women
[01:47:42.240 --> 01:47:45.920]  that run out you know the hundreds of new vaccines that aren't even approved
[01:47:45.920 --> 01:47:49.120]  but that they're allowed to give kids and then just shooting them up with them
[01:47:49.120 --> 01:47:52.720]  and the kids dying left and right with all these diseases and
[01:47:52.720 --> 01:47:57.040]  and and just to know what it's all doing just tears my guts out
[01:47:57.040 --> 01:48:00.960]  and uh you know what maybe you should file an
[01:48:00.960 --> 01:48:06.160]  injunction on it there are legal actions and uh
[01:48:06.160 --> 01:48:10.880]  you can also pray for but i mean i understand look it's a religion of
[01:48:10.880 --> 01:48:13.920]  hating men a salesman will tell you it's hard to
[01:48:13.920 --> 01:48:16.640]  sell your family on something i don't know why statistically
[01:48:16.640 --> 01:48:20.240]  but you know everybody's experienced it where family won't listen to you but
[01:48:20.240 --> 01:48:22.720]  they'll listen to some stranger at their door
[01:48:22.720 --> 01:48:25.440]  and it's even worse between men and women sometimes
[01:48:25.440 --> 01:48:29.280]  of uh you know oh i'm rebelling against the man
[01:48:29.280 --> 01:48:32.880]  because you're the man meanwhile the the eugenicists are completely
[01:48:32.880 --> 01:48:36.240]  controlling her life and are just having her way with her
[01:48:36.240 --> 01:48:40.080]  and you know what your son could die a cancer when he's 15 for all we know and
[01:48:40.080 --> 01:48:43.120]  i'm not saying that's gonna happen but it could and she'll still make up crap
[01:48:43.120 --> 01:48:47.760]  about it i mean she's just a floozy and just a ding bat and i'm sorry for you
[01:48:47.760 --> 01:48:51.040]  sir it tears my guts out to hear that i appreciate your call dan
[01:48:51.040 --> 01:48:56.560]  uh i just can't imagine and i know exactly what you're talking about
[01:48:56.560 --> 01:48:59.040]  i have these yuppies will come up to me on the street
[01:48:59.040 --> 01:49:02.800]  you know and go oh alex the new world order is gonna get me
[01:49:02.800 --> 01:49:06.240]  as the banks collapse as the world government takes over as they admit the
[01:49:06.240 --> 01:49:09.600]  world government as they're being conquered they still will stop their
[01:49:09.600 --> 01:49:14.080]  car sometimes and make a smart mouth comment and giggle and smile oh they
[01:49:14.080 --> 01:49:17.840]  enjoy it they're going to enjoy the depression so much
[01:49:17.840 --> 01:49:23.120]  let's go ahead and talk to alex in arizona alex you're on the air
[01:49:23.120 --> 01:49:26.640]  come on alex you're on the air
[01:49:26.640 --> 01:49:32.000]  he hung up okay uh i got a lot of different call lists here i got two
[01:49:32.000 --> 01:49:35.840]  different call list in front of me i don't know if i got time to go to
[01:49:35.840 --> 01:49:39.600]  zack in toronto zack make it quick my friend go ahead well i was going to
[01:49:39.600 --> 01:49:43.200]  tell you what happened to us on the way down to the g20 alex but
[01:49:43.200 --> 01:49:47.040]  how were you taught about how it is to be free well i went down with my
[01:49:47.040 --> 01:49:51.920]  brother and uh one of our friends and uh but two stops because we live east of
[01:49:51.920 --> 01:49:55.840]  uh toronto but we're within public transportation as far as the trains go
[01:49:55.840 --> 01:50:00.080]  um when we about two stops in uh close to the city
[01:50:00.080 --> 01:50:03.920]  we had someone come on wearing government of ontario which is our
[01:50:03.920 --> 01:50:07.840]  train service uh uniform sit right near us
[01:50:07.840 --> 01:50:11.920]  and uh we weren't doing anything wrong we had no uh weapons or bandanas or
[01:50:11.920 --> 01:50:14.560]  anything like that the point is you're being taught to submit and answer
[01:50:14.560 --> 01:50:18.240]  questions of secret police well as soon as we got off when when the train stopped
[01:50:18.240 --> 01:50:20.640]  in toronto as soon as we were about to get off she was in front of us and she
[01:50:20.640 --> 01:50:24.240]  sort of tapped her nose and we were rushed uh with by three police
[01:50:24.240 --> 01:50:28.000]  who targeted us they let everyone else off and they said no that's the stasi
[01:50:28.000 --> 01:50:31.920]  system this is all training them to the stasi force and it's always when the
[01:50:31.920 --> 01:50:34.560]  bankers come to town but long after the bankers leave they're going to keep
[01:50:34.560 --> 01:50:38.000]  doing this this is east germany and don't worry that woman's going to have
[01:50:38.000 --> 01:50:41.840]  everything she's got taken but she's so stupid she'll never even know it
[01:50:41.840 --> 01:50:45.920]  i'll tell you what stay there zack stay there and we'll hear about how you're
[01:50:45.920 --> 01:50:51.520]  a criminal a thought criminal and the bankers that have stolen everything and
[01:50:51.520 --> 01:50:58.720]  1.2 billion in security funding how much they love you zack how much they love

[01:54:06.240 --> 01:54:12.160]  we're going live at prisonplanet.tv coming up in the next hour
[01:54:12.160 --> 01:54:17.120]  look in my stack today i have mainstream news articles about new gmo crops
[01:54:17.120 --> 01:54:21.360]  that sterilize and kill and deform large percentages the majority of
[01:54:21.360 --> 01:54:25.200]  guinea pigs just a whole new study
[01:54:25.920 --> 01:54:30.560]  and all i can do is keep my foot down on the pedal and never mind the breaks
[01:54:30.560 --> 01:54:33.520]  because i got people to warn and i'm not going to mince words anymore
[01:54:33.520 --> 01:54:38.000]  i know for 100% fact that sodium fluoride attacks every organ in the body
[01:54:38.000 --> 01:54:45.680]  massively increases cancer of the blood of the bones
[01:54:45.680 --> 01:54:51.920]  leukemias i mean i know i have a cnn report now i first saw this about six
[01:54:51.920 --> 01:54:55.200]  seven years ago and covered it i didn't believe it first people would email me
[01:54:55.200 --> 01:54:59.360]  articles going did you know chicken mcnuggets and hamburgers and fries
[01:54:59.360 --> 01:55:02.560]  have silicone in it and that it's a it's a deadly
[01:55:02.560 --> 01:55:08.000]  plastic from oil and i went and looked it up and it was true
[01:55:08.000 --> 01:55:12.720]  but let me tell you what makes me mad it's in cnn today
[01:55:12.720 --> 01:55:16.160]  and they report it like they're talking about
[01:55:16.160 --> 01:55:21.520]  some non-issue like you know real blandly oh yes all over the world in in in
[01:55:21.520 --> 01:55:26.080]  england and japan they they don't allow oil it says
[01:55:26.080 --> 01:55:30.800]  petrochemical derivative silicon they don't allow that but in the
[01:55:30.800 --> 01:55:35.520]  unit then in the u.s uh it's it's in the mcnuggets
[01:55:35.520 --> 01:55:38.240]  and of course evil is going to come out of that the feds are going to take over
[01:55:38.240 --> 01:55:41.360]  all food production in the name of stopping that and then put even worse
[01:55:41.360 --> 01:55:44.720]  things in it's it's that's their genius they screw stuff up
[01:55:44.720 --> 01:55:50.240]  they give the orders i mean literally chicken mcnuggets ladies and gentlemen
[01:55:50.240 --> 01:55:56.000]  and it's seeing in what why well why and i bet if that guy tells his wife who
[01:55:56.000 --> 01:55:58.640]  works for the sheriff's department you know she's a member of the establishment
[01:55:58.640 --> 01:56:02.160]  oh honey at least please don't give her son chicken mcnuggets it's got plastic
[01:56:02.160 --> 01:56:07.520]  in it shut up you stupid ape you dumb conspiracy theory
[01:56:07.520 --> 01:56:11.680]  just i just i just can't handle it anymore
[01:56:11.680 --> 01:56:14.720]  it's like i saw these four cops yesterday come in the uh barbecue place
[01:56:14.720 --> 01:56:17.920]  and everybody got scared quit talking why did everybody get scared when cops
[01:56:17.920 --> 01:56:21.120]  came in if we're such a free country i mean i mean is it their fault is it the
[01:56:21.120 --> 01:56:23.920]  media's fault maybe the citizens are all bad maybe maybe they
[01:56:23.920 --> 01:56:26.800]  shouldn't be scared when the cops come in maybe they're all criminals maybe
[01:56:26.800 --> 01:56:30.720]  the maybe the dozen or so families and
[01:56:30.720 --> 01:56:34.160]  10 other groups of individuals in there or so there's probably 40 50 people in
[01:56:34.160 --> 01:56:36.800]  there you know maybe they're all criminals maybe the four cops were the
[01:56:36.800 --> 01:56:40.720]  only good people maybe it was normal they all got quiet
[01:56:40.720 --> 01:56:43.840]  and quit talking when the cops sat down and after 10 minutes i couldn't take it
[01:56:43.840 --> 01:56:45.840]  anymore i had to go over there and break the silence
[01:56:45.840 --> 01:56:50.320]  as a human being with red blood and show those cops for humans too i warned
[01:56:50.320 --> 01:56:53.440]  them just like i would sometimes stop and warn a family
[01:56:53.440 --> 01:56:57.040]  i don't care if i look kooky i don't care what weak scum
[01:56:57.040 --> 01:57:00.400]  thinks of me i know i'm right period end of story
[01:57:00.400 --> 01:57:03.440]  and the truth may have driven me a little nuts i'll tell you the truth
[01:57:03.440 --> 01:57:06.960]  because because i can't sit here and take it anymore
[01:57:06.960 --> 01:57:09.760]  and i walked over to those cops and i said you know there's a world government
[01:57:09.760 --> 01:57:12.080]  farming and they said yeah we know about it and i said well you know that's a
[01:57:12.080 --> 01:57:15.520]  chemical weapon in your water that sodium fluoride and they
[01:57:15.520 --> 01:57:19.680]  didn't really look at me like i was crazy and they were
[01:57:19.680 --> 01:57:23.040]  but i did say it a bit authoritatively i wasn't being loud i was just being very
[01:57:23.040 --> 01:57:26.480]  stern i could be a lot more stern in person
[01:57:26.480 --> 01:57:29.840]  a lot more focused a lot more
[01:57:30.560 --> 01:57:36.960]  electric and i literally got their attention and i explained to them they've
[01:57:36.960 --> 01:57:39.680]  got choices to make and that they and their families are being killed by
[01:57:39.680 --> 01:57:42.400]  slow acting binary weapons and ladies and gentlemen that
[01:57:42.400 --> 01:57:46.480]  isn't just a word these aren't just words the truth is so much
[01:57:46.480 --> 01:57:51.040]  more if you would just look it up do it do it

[01:58:08.880 --> 01:58:11.840]  purpose i shouldn't even have to do a radio
[01:58:11.840 --> 01:58:15.520]  show to stop this everyone should instantly go out and get angry about

[01:58:53.280 --> 01:58:57.360]  solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily
[01:58:57.360 --> 01:59:01.040]  double or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are
[01:59:01.040 --> 01:59:04.720]  wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have
[01:59:04.720 --> 01:59:08.960]  it's true total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid
[01:59:08.960 --> 01:59:13.360]  technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid
[01:59:13.360 --> 01:59:17.040]  is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation
[01:59:17.040 --> 01:59:20.880]  is only compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a
[01:59:20.880 --> 01:59:24.080]  threat to local grids every year thousands of families lose
[01:59:24.080 --> 01:59:28.000]  their power from weather related onages number five a solar power generator
[01:59:28.000 --> 01:59:31.840]  provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks i really believe in

[02:00:42.800 --> 02:00:47.920]  then we got guests coming up uh but uh finish up zack in toronto
[02:00:47.920 --> 02:00:51.600]  for those that just joined us recap your your you get on the train you're in
[02:00:51.600 --> 02:00:55.200]  toronto you're not in political activist outfits nothing
[02:00:55.200 --> 02:00:59.520]  a woman sits down beside you sees a spy she alerts and
[02:00:59.520 --> 02:01:03.920]  has cops when you get off the train come after you and this is all part of the
[02:01:03.920 --> 02:01:07.360]  east germanization i mean they did hire marcus wolf
[02:01:07.360 --> 02:01:11.200]  eight years ago to train homeland security now of course this is canada
[02:01:11.200 --> 02:01:15.120]  the former head of the stasi but uh go ahead and finish up your point zack
[02:01:15.120 --> 02:01:18.240]  i'll go as quick as i can alex so that's correct we were identified
[02:01:18.240 --> 02:01:22.560]  by this lady and uh police basically rushed on they held us
[02:01:22.560 --> 02:01:26.000]  this was i want everyone to understand this is before any protest had even
[02:01:26.000 --> 02:01:29.600]  started this was at 1130 in the morning protest did not start till one
[02:01:29.600 --> 02:01:33.600]  so right off the bat we were treated as criminals when we were cited right away
[02:01:33.600 --> 02:01:36.560]  and what they got us to put our hands up and they asked us to provide
[02:01:36.560 --> 02:01:40.400]  identification under the new secret law which is only supposed to apply
[02:01:40.400 --> 02:01:44.000]  five meters from the fence however we were on the train platform
[02:01:44.000 --> 02:01:46.880]  farther away my brother asked what would happen if we did not comply they
[02:01:46.880 --> 02:01:49.440]  answered immediately you will be detained for 24 hours
[02:01:49.440 --> 02:01:53.440]  we gave them our identification which they wrote down everything
[02:01:53.440 --> 02:01:58.240]  you gotta learn that you will be detained you will be disappeared
[02:01:58.240 --> 02:02:00.960]  that's correct because they knew they had nothing on us however they figured
[02:02:00.960 --> 02:02:04.640]  they could hold us for the you know 23 hours and 59 minutes and let us
[02:02:04.640 --> 02:02:08.080]  free with nothing so they were taking our meanwhile england and the u.s are
[02:02:08.080 --> 02:02:11.520]  trying to pass indefinite you just disappear forever and those cops would
[02:02:11.520 --> 02:02:14.560]  love it how many videos have you seen a cops beating somebody up
[02:02:14.560 --> 02:02:16.880]  and then charging them with assaulting them
[02:02:16.880 --> 02:02:20.560]  i mean it's just it's just they love it they love it and all the alayna kagans
[02:02:20.560 --> 02:02:24.400]  can just steal everything well exactly and they took down our
[02:02:24.400 --> 02:02:27.280]  information keep in mind we hadn't committed any crimes i asked them where
[02:02:27.280 --> 02:02:30.480]  the information or what the information was for they said it was if we talk to
[02:02:30.480 --> 02:02:34.000]  another police officer they could uh they could tell they'd already spoken to us
[02:02:34.000 --> 02:02:36.640]  which i know they're bringing you into an intelligence database it happened to
[02:02:36.640 --> 02:02:40.320]  me in england five years ago yes so i plan on following up with the police
[02:02:40.320 --> 02:02:43.760]  force with that up anyway though uh besides the point they don't care what
[02:02:43.760 --> 02:02:47.040]  you're a blood bag you're there to supply them blood you're there to supply
[02:02:47.040 --> 02:02:51.120]  money boy they let me and my brother free eventually they held our friend told
[02:02:51.120 --> 02:02:54.240]  us that he would be set free they took about a half an hour by this point we
[02:02:54.240 --> 02:02:57.200]  were trying to meet with toronto truth the gentleman you spoke to yesterday
[02:02:57.200 --> 02:03:00.800]  and we'd already missed meeting up with the beginning of their march we waited
[02:03:00.800 --> 02:03:04.400]  for a friend for about another hour and then the police phoned us told us they'd
[02:03:04.400 --> 02:03:07.120]  lost his id he wanted to know if we had it
[02:03:07.120 --> 02:03:11.200]  and that they were detaining him for 24 hours uh he has
[02:03:11.200 --> 02:03:15.040]  uh lots more uh you know that's your police just snatching people off the
[02:03:15.040 --> 02:03:18.480]  streets you need to make a youtube testimony about it and
[02:03:18.480 --> 02:03:22.480]  remember last year or how many months was that last year this year when was the
[02:03:22.480 --> 02:03:26.720]  g20 in pittsburgh that we sent doing them to it was last year wasn't
[02:03:26.720 --> 02:03:31.760]  yeah uh they had private security great in military
[02:03:31.760 --> 02:03:36.160]  uniforms grabbing people off the streets and on the news throwing them into
[02:03:36.160 --> 02:03:39.280]  vehicles and they've they passed an emergency law in
[02:03:39.280 --> 02:03:41.440]  canada where these private police can do that as
[02:03:41.440 --> 02:03:44.880]  well and it's about trying the police the public the media
[02:03:44.880 --> 02:03:49.120]  that people just disappear off the streets and now they've got legislation
[02:03:49.120 --> 02:03:52.480]  in england and the united states to permanently
[02:03:52.480 --> 02:03:57.440]  disappear you and allow your torture and
[02:03:57.440 --> 02:04:01.120]  they love it they love it and they've got all these cops that watch jack bower
[02:04:01.120 --> 02:04:04.800]  and think torture is cool and we are entering hell
[02:04:04.800 --> 02:04:08.640]  i mean you know the hedge of protection the the declaration of independence the
[02:04:08.640 --> 02:04:11.120]  bill of rights the constitution is disappearing
[02:04:11.120 --> 02:04:15.120]  it's almost completely gone it's like a castle wall that's 95 blown away
[02:04:15.120 --> 02:04:18.480]  there's just some rubble there so it's kind of a heap the enemy has to run
[02:04:18.480 --> 02:04:23.120]  over and uh it it's just it's i mean folks it is
[02:04:23.120 --> 02:04:26.400]  bona fide so uh your friend disappeared into the gulag
[02:04:26.400 --> 02:04:30.880]  huh yeah he might slip ahead his head while he's in but they still charged him
[02:04:30.880 --> 02:04:33.680]  with breach of the peace however keep in mind that we were rushed while we were
[02:04:33.680 --> 02:04:35.920]  still on the train we never even set foot in the city
[02:04:35.920 --> 02:04:39.440]  so how he breached the peace i'm not exactly sure well it's a religion of
[02:04:39.440 --> 02:04:43.040]  government to falsely charge people it's a but see they're the winners
[02:04:43.040 --> 02:04:45.520]  they're the cops they work for the bankers
[02:04:45.520 --> 02:04:49.440]  ha ha they get to write the rules little man

[02:08:37.840 --> 02:08:41.440]  what they did was for the first time ever rule that state
[02:08:41.440 --> 02:08:46.640]  and city governments can restrict the second amendment
[02:08:46.640 --> 02:08:50.160]  that was one of the federal rights in the bill of rights that could not be
[02:08:50.160 --> 02:08:56.160]  touched and they're now saying you can basically uh completely ban
[02:08:56.160 --> 02:08:59.680]  guns you just got to claim that that's what the second
[02:08:59.680 --> 02:09:02.560]  amendment is and that's what the ruling says

[02:09:20.320 --> 02:09:23.840]  uh then you pay all these fines and fees then maybe
[02:09:23.840 --> 02:09:28.080]  maybe so that's just so the mafia crooks can have guns themselves and you

[02:10:58.000 --> 02:11:02.560]  you look like a complete psychopath you look like a crazed demon

[02:11:36.720 --> 02:11:40.080]  what did we do i know we kill 50 million babies in america
[02:11:40.080 --> 02:11:43.520]  i know we're evil i know we're decadent but we're not all that evil

[02:11:58.320 --> 02:12:01.680]  we so domesticated and god says because you're
[02:12:01.680 --> 02:12:07.840]  decadent slugs what do you expect that's god's answer
[02:12:07.840 --> 02:12:12.560]  soft demonic worldly scum sadam ingamora
[02:12:12.560 --> 02:12:20.240]  roam we are going to fall and in the fall of america all of the soft slugs
[02:12:20.240 --> 02:12:23.200]  are going to be salted and they're going to get what they want so i guess god
[02:12:23.200 --> 02:12:26.640]  saying i'm going to give you the answer you know i'm accelerating this this
[02:12:26.640 --> 02:12:32.400]  this uh case of uh scurvy that you have i'm letting it come to a head
[02:12:32.400 --> 02:12:35.760]  i guess that's what god would say
[02:12:35.760 --> 02:12:44.880]  i mean the financial reform bill is not a financial reform bill the
[02:12:44.880 --> 02:12:49.440]  headline should be financial reform bill is federal reserve complete power grab
[02:12:49.440 --> 02:12:52.080]  and takeover of society even the washington post admitted that
[02:12:52.080 --> 02:12:55.760]  yesterday they admitted that 600 trillion
[02:12:55.760 --> 02:12:59.280]  conservatively in derivatives more like 1.5 quadrillion 1,500
[02:12:59.280 --> 02:13:03.360]  triple that all right i tripled that it allows the
[02:13:03.360 --> 02:13:07.120]  private inner group that has fellow reserve membership to take over any
[02:13:07.120 --> 02:13:10.960]  other institutions they want unlimited power the
[02:13:10.960 --> 02:13:15.840]  washington post said almost unlimited somewhere here in my stack i'll find it
[02:13:15.840 --> 02:13:19.360]  and go back over it i covered it sunday i covered it friday
[02:13:19.360 --> 02:13:23.840]  again there is a surrealness to all of this it's so
[02:13:23.840 --> 02:13:27.200]  naked it's the fellow reserve that's
[02:13:27.200 --> 02:13:31.680]  annihilated us that's the reason the dollars being devalued it's the reason
[02:13:31.680 --> 02:13:34.640]  we're in a depression
[02:13:37.440 --> 02:13:43.120]  it isn't a reform to give them more power
[02:13:43.120 --> 02:13:46.800]  people think of the word reform is something good but in lawyer speak it
[02:13:46.800 --> 02:13:52.560]  just means to change so it is a reform i guess hitler being elected was a
[02:13:52.560 --> 02:13:56.480]  reform it was a bad reform in 33 but it was a reform
[02:13:56.480 --> 02:14:03.200]  that was certainly change a time of change i guess stalin was a reform
[02:14:03.200 --> 02:14:06.000]  but not a good one
[02:14:07.040 --> 02:14:10.320]  we had a bill of rights and constitution to protect us from being robbed by
[02:14:10.320 --> 02:14:15.280]  tyrants and when it's gone folks 100 of the
[02:14:15.280 --> 02:14:19.200]  time you will be run over you will live like they do in third
[02:14:19.200 --> 02:14:22.160]  world countries because they are robbed by the elite
[02:14:22.160 --> 02:14:25.680]  it's all going to be gone very soon you can already see it
[02:14:25.680 --> 02:14:29.920]  draining away like pulling the plug on a bathtub
[02:14:29.920 --> 02:14:33.760]  and the water is going down you see the whirlpool and the last bits draining
[02:14:33.760 --> 02:14:36.000]  away
[02:14:37.200 --> 02:14:40.320]  and the globalists we've got running things i've shown themselves to be very
[02:14:40.320 --> 02:14:43.680]  bloody this isn't just going to be some corrupt system this is going to be a
[02:14:43.680 --> 02:14:47.360]  hot persecution and arrest and and and they want to
[02:14:47.360 --> 02:14:52.560]  revel in our blood you understand that these are aggressive people and
[02:14:52.560 --> 02:14:56.320]  coming in to take it look how kagan's just looking at

[02:15:41.440 --> 02:15:45.520]  all of them cowed by her every single one of them
[02:15:45.520 --> 02:15:49.040]  and she just i've never seen somebody in a hearing i mean a few times she was

[02:17:56.160 --> 02:17:59.440]  i've ever seen go ahead john
[02:17:59.440 --> 02:18:03.600]  hey alex this is uh the canadian john galt first time caller long time listener
[02:18:03.600 --> 02:18:07.760]  prison planet subscriber welcome i was one of the people who was
[02:18:07.760 --> 02:18:12.160]  uh detained for no reason forced to stand in the rain for hours
[02:18:12.160 --> 02:18:15.600]  uh people were getting drenched people were freezing cold having their
[02:18:15.600 --> 02:18:19.200]  equipment destroyed yeah well you know protest the bankers that are robbing
[02:18:19.200 --> 02:18:22.160]  you the cops are going to show you little man
[02:18:22.160 --> 02:18:25.920]  well you know we we had uh we had some signs and uh and we were talking to
[02:18:25.920 --> 02:18:30.960]  police all along and they loved our signs they know all about it
[02:18:30.960 --> 02:18:34.800]  it was amazing i still also the regular cops are good
[02:18:34.800 --> 02:18:38.480]  but the special little political units because the word i've gotten from
[02:18:38.480 --> 02:18:42.160]  countless people that have been detained was they enjoyed it
[02:18:42.160 --> 02:18:45.040]  well you know they didn't seem to know what the heck
[02:18:45.040 --> 02:18:48.720]  was going on to tell you the truth they they were just following their orders
[02:18:48.720 --> 02:18:52.640]  right but uh the thing is that about half of them
[02:18:52.640 --> 02:18:55.680]  they were telling me about 9-11 in the new world order
[02:18:55.680 --> 02:18:59.040]  uh the only thing they didn't seem to know about was the agent provocateur
[02:18:59.040 --> 02:19:01.920]  they didn't even believe it
[02:19:02.800 --> 02:19:07.200]  well you know i talk about cops a lot and you know the the media shows us the
[02:19:07.200 --> 02:19:11.680]  bad examples of what police do but most cops i talked to are actually
[02:19:11.680 --> 02:19:16.480]  salt of the earth and it's a media psi op that we all
[02:19:16.480 --> 02:19:20.160]  fall into when they constantly show the few
[02:19:20.160 --> 02:19:24.240]  cops that are really doing bad things that's to make the public not like the
[02:19:24.240 --> 02:19:28.800]  cops and the cops feel like we don't like them and so it's to divide us
[02:19:28.800 --> 02:19:31.280]  it's just like that restaurant yesterday where the cops came in and
[02:19:31.280 --> 02:19:34.080]  everybody got quiet for 10 minutes and i couldn't handle it anymore i went over
[02:19:34.080 --> 02:19:36.720]  and talked to them uh we've got to talk to fellow
[02:19:36.720 --> 02:19:40.240]  citizens we got to talk to police and that's good news but i talked to the
[02:19:40.240 --> 02:19:42.960]  love police you know fellow they got arrested charlie veitch
[02:19:42.960 --> 02:19:46.800]  and he said they did enjoy you know arresting him for no reason and
[02:19:46.800 --> 02:19:50.160]  humiliating him but uh that's good news that a lot of police even though they
[02:19:50.160 --> 02:19:53.680]  follow the illegal orders did not like what they were doing
[02:19:53.680 --> 02:19:57.600]  look at spain the official police union for the state
[02:19:57.600 --> 02:20:00.720]  of catalonia said look we shouldn't have done this and we don't appreciate being

[02:26:41.920 --> 02:26:45.440]  you're on access cable tv by the way and it's probably you have an authorization
[02:26:45.440 --> 02:26:49.360]  to call in on the radio because if they can ban us out protesting then they
[02:26:49.360 --> 02:26:51.760]  could ban us on the internet in our free speech and
[02:26:51.760 --> 02:26:56.480]  next they'll ban calling into talk radio how do you do you need to be arrested
[02:26:56.480 --> 02:27:00.000]  sir calling into a talk show for your first amendment
[02:27:00.000 --> 02:27:03.840]  i hope not well no the fcc's proposing shutting this show off
[02:27:03.840 --> 02:27:07.600]  i mean they're openly saying shut down talk radio so
[02:27:07.600 --> 02:27:11.440]  i mean i mean really i'm not even being sarcastic now in the near future
[02:27:11.440 --> 02:27:14.560]  eric maybe maybe it is wrong you're calling into a show
[02:27:14.560 --> 02:27:23.360]  maybe alayna kagan's right maybe maybe uh all these people are right
[02:27:23.360 --> 02:27:26.560]  so anyway did you hear me say i've been watching you since you're on access tv
[02:27:26.560 --> 02:27:31.520]  in austin uh late 90s something like that welcome sir
[02:27:31.520 --> 02:27:36.080]  um anyway i want to call to tell you about uh what appears to be potentially
[02:27:36.080 --> 02:27:40.240]  a female location that's being built in our area
[02:27:40.240 --> 02:27:46.560]  talking about the old uh... mall no um actually
[02:27:46.560 --> 02:27:50.400]  on 183 and 29 there's area called stewart's junction
[02:27:50.400 --> 02:27:53.840]  about 10 miles north of that on 183 there's a
[02:27:53.840 --> 02:27:58.320]  shooting range on the right called stands right next to it
[02:27:58.320 --> 02:28:01.360]  from what i understand my brother and my friends been out there
[02:28:01.360 --> 02:28:04.960]  i've got two pictures of it and from there i went to the count it looks like
[02:28:04.960 --> 02:28:09.280]  what we've seen from other female locations that you've given us info on
[02:28:09.280 --> 02:28:15.120]  what's there there's portables there's chain link gate around it
[02:28:15.120 --> 02:28:20.000]  um there's some heavy uh security doors on the portables
[02:28:20.000 --> 02:28:23.840]  um like i said i've got two camera phone pictures i haven't been out there
[02:28:23.840 --> 02:28:27.360]  myself but um there's there's a whole lot of
[02:28:27.360 --> 02:28:30.880]  portables a big row let me tell you publicly where
[02:28:30.880 --> 02:28:35.120]  the fema cams are out at the old robert miller airport the police admit
[02:28:35.120 --> 02:28:38.880]  there's a continuity government uh hanger with bolts and chains and portapodes
[02:28:38.880 --> 02:28:41.840]  just waiting uh they have these in any major city
[02:28:41.840 --> 02:28:45.440]  the threat fusion centers are federalizing uh the cities
[02:28:45.440 --> 02:28:52.000]  right now so that's going on uh and you also uh of course have uh one of the
[02:28:52.000 --> 02:28:58.480]  old uh malls uh out off of i-35 pardon me guys
[02:28:58.480 --> 02:29:03.040]  yeah highland mall the jaren could tell i was searching for the name sometimes
[02:29:03.040 --> 02:29:08.560]  the most obvious stuff escapes me yeah uh fema has taken over part of that mall
[02:29:08.560 --> 02:29:12.480]  and uh has their fema trucks out there for part of them continuity government
[02:29:12.480 --> 02:29:16.160]  and so it's just all pretty much going on in plain view normally when fema rolls
[02:29:16.160 --> 02:29:21.280]  in they do it at first just you know at a level that at least sounds reasonable
[02:29:21.280 --> 02:29:26.000]  or palatable to sell you on accepting it uh but yeah send us those camera phone
[02:29:26.000 --> 02:29:29.600]  photos i'd be interested to see that can you send them to show tips at info

[02:34:10.960 --> 02:34:14.160]  who are taking action now and i'm humbled and honored to know there's so
[02:34:14.160 --> 02:34:17.360]  many great people out there who are standing up against this new world
[02:34:17.360 --> 02:34:20.880]  order uh let's go ahead and go back to your
[02:34:20.880 --> 02:34:23.680]  calls let's talk to jim in missouri jim you're on the
[02:34:23.680 --> 02:34:29.760]  air hey alex jen hey buddy painless i called you uh i don't know a
[02:34:29.760 --> 02:34:34.880]  couple months ago about the hth buckets which you are aware of
[02:34:34.880 --> 02:34:39.280]  and i am aware of since we have family members that are part of the uh
[02:34:39.280 --> 02:34:44.080]  wonderful water company um
[02:34:44.080 --> 02:34:47.280]  here in st louis they're known as american water
[02:34:47.280 --> 02:34:51.920]  they're not american whatsoever so on that front
[02:34:51.920 --> 02:34:56.880]  you know people just need to realize that if you if you dump a bunch of hth
[02:34:56.880 --> 02:35:00.240]  in a pool you're not supposed to go in a pool so why are you going to drink it
[02:35:00.240 --> 02:35:04.080]  well i mean for those who just joined us i have some cousins in east texas who
[02:35:04.080 --> 02:35:07.600]  have sat around having dinner with and they talk about how yeah
[02:35:07.600 --> 02:35:12.000]  sodium fluorides bug poison you can put a less than a teaspoon on a fire ant
[02:35:12.000 --> 02:35:16.400]  bed it kills them we've got the best water coming out of an aquifer here
[02:35:16.400 --> 02:35:19.600]  but the feds make us put this stuff in there it's from china
[02:35:19.600 --> 02:35:23.680]  it's full of other poisons we have all these newscasts where they report
[02:35:23.680 --> 02:35:27.760]  the same thing not just the fluoride but all these other chemicals
[02:35:27.760 --> 02:35:30.240]  and
[02:35:30.240 --> 02:35:33.840]  was a chemical operator retired but he doesn't even drink the water so that
[02:35:33.840 --> 02:35:37.440]  should tell you something if the if the chemical operators won't drink the
[02:35:37.440 --> 02:35:40.800]  water there's a problem with it but that's not
[02:35:40.800 --> 02:35:45.200]  why i'm calling you um the reason why i'm calling you is
[02:35:45.200 --> 02:35:48.480]  we need to think outside the box and it's getting to that point
[02:35:48.480 --> 02:35:52.480]  where you know everything's getting to be oppressed
[02:35:52.480 --> 02:35:56.800]  as an example uh freeze speech zones okay
[02:35:56.800 --> 02:36:01.040]  you want to play free speech zones games we can play that too
[02:36:01.040 --> 02:36:04.960]  start showing up to europe uh protests
[02:36:04.960 --> 02:36:08.800]  turn your back to uh the individuals you're protesting
[02:36:08.800 --> 02:36:11.920]  don't say a word you don't have to worry about a free speech zone
[02:36:11.920 --> 02:36:15.760]  pretty simple they start acting up against you and pushing you around
[02:36:15.760 --> 02:36:20.080]  you have a right to defend yourself it's pretty simple
[02:36:20.080 --> 02:36:26.240]  uh as far as i drive around with info wars
[02:36:26.240 --> 02:36:30.800]  sticker on the back of my truck and has an insight nine eleven since i job
[02:36:30.800 --> 02:36:34.480]  you would not believe how many police officers they come up to me and they
[02:36:34.480 --> 02:36:38.720]  don't pull me over they they kind of you know
[02:36:38.720 --> 02:36:42.640]  hide in the shadows and then when i pull over like
[02:36:42.640 --> 02:36:46.960]  to home depot whatever they literally get out of their car
[02:36:46.960 --> 02:36:51.520]  and come talk to me and it's great you know because
[02:36:51.520 --> 02:36:55.200]  i'd say 80 percent of them are right along with what you
[02:36:55.200 --> 02:36:58.960]  what what you say i mean they they're very much aware of it
[02:36:58.960 --> 02:37:02.960]  but what i find interesting is they get out of their car
[02:37:02.960 --> 02:37:05.920]  they get away from the car and then they come talk to me
[02:37:05.920 --> 02:37:09.280]  they don't do it in front of the car like you know like if i was getting pulled
[02:37:09.280 --> 02:37:11.760]  over or something well that's wonderful news and i
[02:37:11.760 --> 02:37:18.080]  appreciate your call uh gem i will say this
[02:37:18.080 --> 02:37:24.160]  i learn new things all the time you know the old adage is
[02:37:24.160 --> 02:37:29.280]  the more wisdom you have the more you know you don't know
[02:37:29.280 --> 02:37:32.960]  and i will state it again as i did last hour i more and more realize the
[02:37:32.960 --> 02:37:38.320]  mistakes i've made in decade plus you know going back to 15 years
[02:37:38.320 --> 02:37:41.360]  that i've been on the radio
[02:37:41.760 --> 02:37:46.720]  and one of the biggest ones is just out of hand at a primitive level
[02:37:46.720 --> 02:37:51.520]  seeing police as the representatives of the suppressing
[02:37:51.520 --> 02:37:59.200]  system and beating a not a war drum but a
[02:37:59.200 --> 02:38:03.520]  anger drum at the police
[02:38:04.080 --> 02:38:07.840]  and then what that does is that makes the police compact
[02:38:07.840 --> 02:38:13.760]  more into their little cult system and then they start pulling away from the
[02:38:13.760 --> 02:38:17.680]  public the public sees that change in attitude we pull more
[02:38:17.680 --> 02:38:22.000]  away from them and then the system the feds the globalist
[02:38:22.000 --> 02:38:26.320]  they get what they want a bunch of compartmentalized
[02:38:26.320 --> 02:38:31.280]  citizens and police who happen to be citizens as well
[02:38:31.280 --> 02:38:34.800]  and yes i have been blown away by how much information police give
[02:38:34.800 --> 02:38:39.520]  give me how many police come over and shake my hand who are listeners
[02:38:39.520 --> 02:38:43.520]  even though sometimes the show comes off as if
[02:38:43.520 --> 02:38:49.120]  i am adversarial towards police they still see through all of that and and
[02:38:49.120 --> 02:38:53.040]  and and you know despite that and are sophisticated enough to
[02:38:53.040 --> 02:38:56.720]  understand that i'm for real and that this information is real
[02:38:56.720 --> 02:39:01.040]  and their investigators they have gone and looked at the claims i've made they
[02:39:01.040 --> 02:39:05.280]  found out it's true and i always oversimplify
[02:39:05.280 --> 02:39:08.240]  when you go research when i'm saying you're gonna find out in almost every
[02:39:08.240 --> 02:39:12.960]  case it's light years worse than i can even
[02:39:12.960 --> 02:39:16.480]  explain to people that that's so much of the time now
[02:39:16.480 --> 02:39:21.200]  i am so frustrated by this and so sick of it
[02:39:21.200 --> 02:39:24.240]  and there seems like there's no way to get out of it and it just gets more and
[02:39:24.240 --> 02:39:28.720]  more crazy but then i understand that's a psychological tactic
[02:39:28.720 --> 02:39:33.440]  it's a psychological tactic of the establishment to act crazy to act wild
[02:39:33.440 --> 02:39:37.840]  to act over the top to act domineering and and absurd
[02:39:37.840 --> 02:39:42.080]  so that we just kind of get overwhelmed and get conditioned to accept anything
[02:39:42.080 --> 02:39:49.120]  no i'm not accepting tyranny anymore i'm done i'm done
[02:39:49.120 --> 02:39:52.240]  and i'm going to be bold and i'm going to tell it like it is
[02:39:52.240 --> 02:39:57.680]  and truth is greater than lies and
[02:39:57.680 --> 02:40:02.400]  the pen is miter than the sword if you will simply take action
[02:40:02.400 --> 02:40:05.840]  and warn and inform people about what's going down and what's happening
[02:40:05.840 --> 02:40:08.560]  there's no way they're going to succeed that's why they're rushing
[02:40:08.560 --> 02:40:11.920]  to shut down the internet right now and finally openly
[02:40:11.920 --> 02:40:16.160]  sending up trial balloons to sell you on it and moving ahead with the control
[02:40:16.160 --> 02:40:20.000]  grid they've already built to do it under cyber security three years ago it's
[02:40:20.000 --> 02:40:22.960]  already in place they're now just trying to get the laws in place
[02:40:22.960 --> 02:40:27.360]  to authorize it and they will launch false flags on the web
[02:40:27.360 --> 02:40:30.960]  as the pretext to take control of it and they won't shut it down overnight
[02:40:30.960 --> 02:40:36.480]  they'll say oh we should shut it down for a few days to
[02:40:36.480 --> 02:40:42.000]  protect it and to save it and then see we turned it back on
[02:40:42.000 --> 02:40:44.960]  and then people say well see the government those of you that complained
[02:40:44.960 --> 02:40:47.760]  about it the government saved the internet
[02:40:47.760 --> 02:40:50.800]  i mean i know how their brains work and so that's all coming
[02:40:50.800 --> 02:40:53.920]  that's all going to happen in fact let me cover a few of these news items and
[02:40:53.920 --> 02:40:56.400]  then we're going to go back to your calls here
[02:40:56.400 --> 02:40:59.520]  here's an article that's the top story on prismplanet.com
[02:40:59.520 --> 02:41:03.520]  this just came out in the last hour cyber security measures will mandate
[02:41:03.520 --> 02:41:07.200]  government id tokens to use the internet the move to shut down and
[02:41:07.200 --> 02:41:09.920]  regulate the internet under a new governmental control system has
[02:41:09.920 --> 02:41:13.280]  accelerated into high gear with an announcement that the government
[02:41:13.280 --> 02:41:19.040]  cyber security strategy was revolves around issuing internet users with id
[02:41:19.040 --> 02:41:22.560]  tokens without which they will not be able to visit
[02:41:22.560 --> 02:41:25.600]  websites the latest salvo against web freedom
[02:41:25.600 --> 02:41:28.720]  which in combination with senator joe Lieberman's kill switch bill
[02:41:28.720 --> 02:41:31.920]  will serve to eviscerate the free internet as we know it
[02:41:31.920 --> 02:41:35.200]  under the guise of cyber security the government is moving to
[02:41:35.200 --> 02:41:40.000]  um discredit and shut down at the existing internet infrastructure
[02:41:40.000 --> 02:41:44.960]  in pursuit of a new centralized regulated worldwide web and then we
[02:41:44.960 --> 02:41:47.680]  have links to all their claims all their statements
[02:41:47.680 --> 02:41:51.920]  how they're openly have already hired armies of paid disinformation agents on
[02:41:51.920 --> 02:41:56.160]  the web the pentagon the the state department
[02:41:56.160 --> 02:41:59.280]  in fact tyrell ventura sent me a text message the other day and said
[02:41:59.280 --> 02:42:05.360]  have you seen this and i um had seen it but i never
[02:42:05.360 --> 02:42:09.920]  covered it so before i forget i'm going to go to tyrell's um
[02:42:09.920 --> 02:42:13.920]  text message here but don't show the phones it's got his phone number on here
[02:42:13.920 --> 02:42:20.960]  and i'm going to click on this uh it's america.gov conspiracy theories html
[02:42:20.960 --> 02:42:25.440]  here jaren i'm just going to give you my iphone with this page pulled up
[02:42:25.440 --> 02:42:28.720]  and i want to pull this up on screen for people
[02:42:28.720 --> 02:42:35.120]  thanks a lot um but yes i was aware of it but i'm glad somebody reminded me of
[02:42:35.120 --> 02:42:38.560]  it because so much of what i see and read and study i
[02:42:38.560 --> 02:42:42.640]  never even end up getting to i mean that's why i keep saying over and over
[02:42:42.640 --> 02:42:45.440]  again i'm frustrated because people are thinking i'm making
[02:42:45.440 --> 02:42:49.840]  stuff up or exaggerating it's the opposite okay
[02:42:49.840 --> 02:42:52.880]  i mean you've got to research this for yourself
[02:42:52.880 --> 02:42:56.880]  is is what i'm trying to say uh in the movie the matrix
[02:42:56.880 --> 02:42:59.280]  uh
[02:42:59.280 --> 02:43:03.760]  morpheus tells neo look i can't tell you what the matrix is you got to see it
[02:43:03.760 --> 02:43:06.720]  for yourself but it's the world that's pulled over
[02:43:06.720 --> 02:43:12.080]  your eyes to blind you from the truth that you're a slave neo
[02:43:13.360 --> 02:43:16.560]  and of course we're not really in a matrix like that we're more in a truman
[02:43:16.560 --> 02:43:20.400]  show uh but the pentagon says 30 years ago they
[02:43:20.400 --> 02:43:24.560]  want to build a matrix and the pentagon describes in a declassified
[02:43:24.560 --> 02:43:31.440]  report from the 70s declassified in uh january of 2000
[02:43:32.240 --> 02:43:35.200]  see i don't even want to say this on air because it's an actual army report but
[02:43:35.200 --> 02:43:38.160]  people wouldn't believe it they say they want to put you in
[02:43:38.160 --> 02:43:41.440]  tanks like in the matrix movie and that will be peace global peace
[02:43:41.440 --> 02:43:44.800]  is everyone in tanks with wires hooked into their heads in a new virtual
[02:43:44.800 --> 02:43:47.680]  reality with the ruling elite above us and they're going to use it as an
[02:43:47.680 --> 02:43:50.800]  energy source i mean the movie matrix is just throwing in your face
[02:43:50.800 --> 02:43:54.480]  what they plan and the average person watches tv plays the video games all
[02:43:54.480 --> 02:43:56.960]  day all they do is that they're in watch television
[02:43:56.960 --> 02:44:02.000]  your eyes actually interfacing with it uh which of course the site centers are in
[02:44:02.000 --> 02:44:05.840]  the back of the brain so the figuratively jacking you in and you're
[02:44:05.840 --> 02:44:08.640]  being inserted into the matrix right now and
[02:44:08.640 --> 02:44:12.400]  all these top futurists and scientists and ray Kurzweil say within 10 years
[02:44:12.400 --> 02:44:15.440]  if you want a job you'll have to have the brain ship they already make the
[02:44:15.440 --> 02:44:18.160]  mexican attorney general's employees taking plantable chips and
[02:44:18.160 --> 02:44:22.000]  whether they're going to be able to do it or not the point is the the pentagon
[02:44:22.000 --> 02:44:25.920]  and people are theorizing about these type of things and the type of world
[02:44:25.920 --> 02:44:29.680]  they want to build because there will be no more war there will only be peace
[02:44:29.680 --> 02:44:33.120]  when you're all prisoners of the matrix
[02:44:33.120 --> 02:44:38.800]  there it is america dot gov and after all you can't be against america
[02:44:38.800 --> 02:44:44.080]  conspiracy theories and misinformation and they tell you that all vaccines are
[02:44:44.080 --> 02:44:46.320]  good for and there's never a problem even though it's on the news every day
[02:44:46.320 --> 02:44:49.600]  it's killing people and they tell you that uh
[02:44:49.600 --> 02:44:55.200]  september 11th wasn't an inside job uh and they tell you it's a
[02:44:55.200 --> 02:44:58.720]  misconception that the u.s doesn't like islam
[02:44:58.720 --> 02:45:01.840]  and they tell you it's a misconception that the bankers are ripping you off
[02:45:01.840 --> 02:45:05.040]  you know made off really is a good guy
[02:45:05.040 --> 02:45:08.720]  and i mean this is an official propaganda channel and imagine
[02:45:08.720 --> 02:45:16.000]  we've got the pentagon openly saying that they i mean i watched
[02:45:16.000 --> 02:45:23.040]  clark in testimony from last week say the head of cyber security of cybercom
[02:45:23.040 --> 02:45:27.120]  say that we are the four branches of the military we're operating domestically
[02:45:27.120 --> 02:45:30.320]  and we're taking over the internet to protect it
[02:45:30.320 --> 02:45:34.320]  kind of like the mafia is gonna oh why don't you put my cousin luigi in your
[02:45:34.320 --> 02:45:37.920]  grocery store and uh then there won't be any fires
[02:45:37.920 --> 02:45:41.600]  because that's how you pay for the insurance you'll look out for fires
[02:45:41.600 --> 02:45:45.440]  but if you don't give him a full-time job he won't be here but you'll send him
[02:45:45.440 --> 02:45:48.240]  the money once a week he'll drop by and get it
[02:45:48.240 --> 02:45:52.080]  if you don't do that uh there's gonna be a fire
[02:45:52.080 --> 02:45:55.440]  if you don't let us run the internet and shut it off and get rid of those
[02:45:55.440 --> 02:45:58.720]  conspiracy theorists there's going to be a little fire
[02:45:58.720 --> 02:46:01.920]  and the internet's going to get destroyed by the chinese that we're in
[02:46:01.920 --> 02:46:06.160]  business with and so you need to let us run
[02:46:06.160 --> 02:46:09.920]  things now you need to let us run things now
[02:46:09.920 --> 02:46:13.200]  where there's going to be a big big problem out there you

[02:47:02.720 --> 02:47:06.240]  and we don't let the little people get up around here
[02:47:06.240 --> 02:47:11.360]  take whoever's property we want and we run the drugs through this area
[02:47:11.360 --> 02:47:15.440]  but when we catch them young doper kids using it we also throw them in the jail
[02:47:15.440 --> 02:47:19.920]  hey
[02:47:20.000 --> 02:47:24.160]  there's a lot of opportunities to work with the government i like obama
[02:47:24.160 --> 02:47:31.200]  i've heard them talk like that oh god but uh you can read about it
[02:47:31.200 --> 02:47:34.240]  ids to use the internet meaning they're tracking everything you do and
[02:47:34.240 --> 02:47:37.440]  surveilling you filters controlling what you can see
[02:47:37.440 --> 02:47:40.720]  the government this is in the cyber security bill that's past the house
[02:47:40.720 --> 02:47:45.680]  past the senate committee it's pretty much a sure thing vote now
[02:47:45.680 --> 02:47:49.280]  though little little hitler bird is now dead but i'm sure whoever they replace
[02:47:49.280 --> 02:47:53.040]  him with uh they need all those votes they can get
[02:47:53.040 --> 02:47:56.960]  obama internet kills which plan approved by the senate that's tech world
[02:47:56.960 --> 02:48:01.360]  here's our story up for two and a half days at drudge report
[02:48:01.360 --> 02:48:05.120]  uh it's been up since saturday's i saw it sunday which went up from saturday i've
[02:48:05.120 --> 02:48:08.720]  been told obama could shut down internet for four months under new
[02:48:08.720 --> 02:48:12.320]  emergency powers you might want to actually go read this we have the
[02:48:12.320 --> 02:48:15.600]  quotes out of the bill itself
[02:48:16.320 --> 02:48:19.120]  and even though this is all over the news and admitted it's like well that's
[02:48:19.120 --> 02:48:23.520]  just the way it is you know we've got to uh
[02:48:23.520 --> 02:48:27.680]  we've got to do that we've got to do that right now
[02:48:27.680 --> 02:48:31.200]  but hey the supreme court gave us our gun rights no they didn't
[02:48:31.200 --> 02:48:34.960]  they said counties and cities can restrict your second amendment just not
[02:48:34.960 --> 02:48:38.160]  completely they never had that fake authority before but
[02:48:38.160 --> 02:48:40.960]  now one of the kangaroo branches of government
[02:48:40.960 --> 02:48:45.040]  has said that states and cities can restrict your second amendment
[02:48:45.040 --> 02:48:48.560]  states can't restrict anything under the bill of rights
[02:48:48.560 --> 02:48:51.920]  and the minute they try that's when the federal power comes in
[02:48:51.920 --> 02:48:55.520]  it's a separation of powers the states aren't too powerful the feds aren't too
[02:48:55.520 --> 02:48:58.800]  powerful and it's always that balance and so
[02:48:58.800 --> 02:49:02.000]  the establishment's like we kind of like states rights yeah
[02:49:02.000 --> 02:49:08.080]  states rights says you hand your gun in that's what the ruling says oh
[02:49:08.080 --> 02:49:10.960]  it just doesn't mean the chicago gun ban can still
[02:49:10.960 --> 02:49:14.560]  you know not be in place it just means that you've got to modify it a bit
[02:49:14.560 --> 02:49:17.600]  all right don't worry you'll still get their guns elito said they said
[02:49:17.600 --> 02:49:21.200]  oh and so that's why the gun control groups are very excited right now
[02:49:21.200 --> 02:49:24.880]  they're like don't worry we got we're gonna get these people
[02:49:24.880 --> 02:49:28.480]  we've got them where we want them all right they're chumps this is meant to

[02:54:52.320 --> 02:54:55.520]  ever seen i mean she is bold at least the others have been federal or state
[02:54:55.520 --> 02:54:57.920]  judges and this woman's never been a judge
[02:54:57.920 --> 02:55:03.200]  never been a trial lawyer but she's a goldman sacks former operative
[02:55:03.200 --> 02:55:08.240]  isn't that just special and so now up on prison planet dot tv for viewers we

[02:55:19.280 --> 02:55:22.400]  big gel and i i had that out in my mind so a
[02:55:22.400 --> 02:55:26.640]  listener steve uh put this together and and and wait a minute phil is an
[02:55:26.640 --> 02:55:31.040]  awesome graphics guy phil where's yours you made one
[02:55:31.040 --> 02:55:35.280]  well she's so she's so beautiful you can't look at her anymore
[02:55:35.280 --> 02:55:38.240]  and i'm someone that doesn't really put a lot of stock in what someone looks
[02:55:38.240 --> 02:55:41.600]  like uh i don't normally talk about the cover of a
[02:55:41.600 --> 02:55:44.400]  book but i mean today can we find an image of her
[02:55:44.400 --> 02:55:48.880]  from the hearings are they still going i mean she's wearing this Byzantine
[02:55:48.880 --> 02:55:52.240]  queen elizabeth's giant outfit her hands look bigger than her head
[02:55:52.240 --> 02:55:55.920]  so i can beatle juice he has this tiny head
[02:55:55.920 --> 02:56:02.400]  and she's like like a grimer wormwood or something from lord
[02:56:02.400 --> 02:56:04.080]  of the rings when he's hiding behind the throne
[02:56:04.080 --> 02:56:10.480]  hear him how do you feel listen i mean she's literally like

[02:56:18.240 --> 02:56:21.840]  she's not wearing makeup and jewels and that's fine
[02:56:21.840 --> 02:56:24.880]  that's fine if she's androgynous the issue here is
[02:56:24.880 --> 02:56:28.080]  is that why are they dressing her up like a woman and since dressing her up
[02:56:28.080 --> 02:56:32.640]  like a woman is not fair to her style i really looked at her soul her
[02:56:32.640 --> 02:56:37.920]  spirit and saw a clown but not a happy friendly clown no
[02:56:37.920 --> 02:56:44.400]  a dangerous clown clown of our nightmares and so i dub her

[03:01:37.920 --> 03:01:43.200]  thank you um yeah i was up at the uh cbs the local cbs i live in a
[03:01:43.200 --> 03:01:46.400]  suburb here in kansas city called independence
[03:01:46.400 --> 03:01:50.080]  and uh we were i was in there buying my allergy medicine and i just happened
[03:01:50.080 --> 03:01:54.880]  to hear the pharmaceutical rep talking to the head of the pharmacy and they
[03:01:54.880 --> 03:01:58.240]  were just like casually like laughing about this but they said uh
[03:01:58.240 --> 03:02:00.800]  they were going to start uh the pharmaceutical companies were going to
[03:02:00.800 --> 03:02:05.040]  start putting uh statins in the water as well as lithium
[03:02:05.040 --> 03:02:08.720]  and they were just you know yucking it up ha ha ha so funny
[03:02:08.720 --> 03:02:12.480]  and i just don't know that's being proposed on the news and the
[03:02:12.480 --> 03:02:15.760]  of all groups the department of agriculture is looking at
[03:02:15.760 --> 03:02:20.400]  putting lithium and statins and then because after all you're going to be
[03:02:20.400 --> 03:02:24.080]  happier and the police may have to come by and test your blood oh
[03:02:24.080 --> 03:02:30.480]  like in thx 1138 where you avoiding uh you know your drug dose uh
[03:02:30.480 --> 03:02:36.320]  evasion because that's a serious crime and oh uh yes you need your statins
[03:02:36.320 --> 03:02:40.400]  which fry your liver and of course the studies show are a complete fraud
[03:02:40.400 --> 03:02:44.320]  and as the studies come out that the statins are a fraud in almost all cases
[03:02:44.320 --> 03:02:48.320]  they push even more to now make children take statins that's now been on the
[03:02:48.320 --> 03:02:53.200]  news perhaps at age five i mean it's the law everyone must take all these drugs
[03:02:53.200 --> 03:02:56.160]  that big pharma says we must take so you were in there
[03:02:56.160 --> 03:02:59.600]  and heard them snickering and giggling did you talk to them
[03:02:59.600 --> 03:03:03.040]  uh... i i i tried to confront one of them about it and he kind of turned his
[03:03:03.040 --> 03:03:04.800]  back like you know don't talk to me
[03:03:04.800 --> 03:03:08.400]  jerk or something because he's got a special white lab coat and
[03:03:08.400 --> 03:03:10.960]  again he's on a power trip you're just a slave
[03:03:10.960 --> 03:03:14.960]  he's part of the drug guild he's part of the elite drug guild and
[03:03:14.960 --> 03:03:18.160]  you dare to try to speak to him you ramble
[03:03:18.160 --> 03:03:23.280]  yeah pretty much um i also want to make another point i'm a student
[03:03:23.280 --> 03:03:28.080]  filmmaker here in kansas city and i was helping a friend of mine do a
[03:03:28.080 --> 03:03:33.600]  uh... film on the health care bill and it was kind of strange because my the
[03:03:33.600 --> 03:03:36.880]  head of my department is like diehard
[03:03:36.880 --> 03:03:41.520]  obama noid i mean totally buys the garbage
[03:03:41.520 --> 03:03:45.120]  and i had a bunch of the points that were actually in pdf
[03:03:45.120 --> 03:03:48.640]  up behind me and i was making some of the points about uh...
[03:03:48.640 --> 03:03:52.320]  how the illegals wouldn't have to pay any to any of the taxes and the
[03:03:52.320 --> 03:03:56.480]  and the health care would be rationed and uh... she turned and looked at me
[03:03:56.480 --> 03:03:59.440]  right after the uh... final presentation of the documentary and she said
[03:03:59.440 --> 03:04:02.960]  well that's a good propaganda piece
[03:04:02.960 --> 03:04:06.640]  i mean i just kind of looked at her like are you what are you on
[03:04:06.640 --> 03:04:10.800]  well you remember uh... missouri when he was running for office i mean i i'd
[03:04:10.800 --> 03:04:13.760]  heard the rumors in missouri illinois indiana
[03:04:13.760 --> 03:04:18.080]  and vermont of all places where they you know do have a pretty well informed
[03:04:18.080 --> 03:04:20.560]  public and then pretty good laws in place
[03:04:20.560 --> 03:04:23.760]  uh... you know they're very close to our founding fathers vision
[03:04:23.760 --> 03:04:26.960]  in vermont i'd heard the rumors and seen a few news
[03:04:26.960 --> 03:04:31.040]  articles but then i saw the police chiefs and prosecutors on tv
[03:04:31.040 --> 03:04:33.760]  in your city saying if you talk bad about obama
[03:04:33.760 --> 03:04:37.920]  that's illegal you will not lie about him and you say he's a muslim we will
[03:04:37.920 --> 03:04:41.840]  come arrest you and that just shows the
[03:04:41.840 --> 03:04:46.080]  those police are out of their minds i mean this is america
[03:04:46.080 --> 03:04:48.880]  that's why we're america we have that free speech but
[03:04:48.880 --> 03:04:52.000]  and they've got free speech to criticize people in most countries
[03:04:52.000 --> 03:04:55.600]  i mean we are becoming one of the most
[03:04:55.600 --> 03:04:58.880]  authoritative oppressive nations on earth and i'm telling you canada
[03:04:58.880 --> 03:05:02.640]  it is a nightmare well this is alex jones with five good reasons you

[03:05:22.960 --> 03:05:27.360]  the power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation
[03:05:27.360 --> 03:05:31.280]  is only compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a
[03:05:31.280 --> 03:05:34.400]  threat to local grids every year thousands of families lose

[03:09:43.280 --> 03:09:47.280]  this came out three days ago children over six months
[03:09:47.280 --> 03:09:53.440]  and under nine years should have received h1n1 vaccine
[03:09:53.440 --> 03:09:57.040]  yet can expect to get two dosages of seasonal flu this fall
[03:09:57.040 --> 03:10:00.320]  if the center for disease control adopts recommendations for its vaccine
[03:10:00.320 --> 03:10:02.960]  advisory committee and it goes on to say their
[03:10:02.960 --> 03:10:06.080]  they're recommending another injection of h1n1
[03:10:06.080 --> 03:10:10.960]  as well as the new seasonal flu shot i mean the last h1n1 was a hoax it's an
[03:10:10.960 --> 03:10:13.360]  admitted hoax the british medical journal
[03:10:13.360 --> 03:10:17.600]  the european union committee wolfgang woodard the doctor we had on
[03:10:17.600 --> 03:10:21.120]  i mean this is a big deal and so they've got all this unused vaccine and they're
[03:10:21.120 --> 03:10:24.480]  saying well we'll just have the idiots you know the 10 20 30
[03:10:24.480 --> 03:10:27.520]  percent depending on the country record lows
[03:10:27.520 --> 03:10:31.520]  numbers of people are taking it we'll just have all the morons take it
[03:10:31.520 --> 03:10:34.800]  yeah they'll take anything all these soccer moms look
[03:10:34.800 --> 03:10:39.040]  their kids folks i was in a slot skis sunday
[03:10:39.040 --> 03:10:42.320]  with my children before i went and met my parents to take them to see the old
[03:10:42.320 --> 03:10:47.360]  robin hood with whatever that guy's name was the point is
[03:10:47.360 --> 03:10:52.160]  uh that i was in a slot skis and there were literally two different kids with
[03:10:52.160 --> 03:10:56.560]  different families who were autistic wearing football helmets
[03:10:56.560 --> 03:10:59.680]  but they were like medicalized football helmets
[03:10:59.680 --> 03:11:03.680]  and these were good-looking kids who would have had futures
[03:11:03.680 --> 03:11:07.440]  and they had good-looking parents and i'll bet you my bottom dollar that all
[03:11:07.440 --> 03:11:10.800]  this tinkering with the genetic code and what's in the vaccines did that to them
[03:11:10.800 --> 03:11:13.920]  we've had countless medical doctors on that have documented
[03:11:13.920 --> 03:11:17.040]  and i wanted to go over and warn them look if you're going to have more kids
[03:11:17.040 --> 03:11:20.960]  just don't do this to them the government doesn't love you stop
[03:11:20.960 --> 03:11:24.720]  being so gullible and i tell you i can't really go to a movie
[03:11:24.720 --> 03:11:29.280]  with my kids because the row after row is just autistic children now pretty
[03:11:29.280 --> 03:11:32.400]  soon it'll be half the kids on your block can't talk and can't walk

[03:11:52.960 --> 03:11:57.200]  subject for a moment before we get into a really serious subject
[03:11:57.200 --> 03:12:02.160]  we were able to get alayna kagan's college fraternity
[03:12:02.160 --> 03:12:05.920]  photos from the men's fraternity that she's in
[03:12:05.920 --> 03:12:09.600]  uh... and uh... word is she's had a sex change
[03:12:09.600 --> 03:12:13.040]  uh... and that her idol is john wane gasey
[03:12:13.040 --> 03:12:17.760]  so john wane alayna alayna kagan gasey and so there they are on prison planet

[03:12:20.400 --> 03:12:23.040]  of course she said that uh... she wants to butcher the bill of rights and
[03:12:23.040 --> 03:12:27.120]  constitution not young boys in a basement so that's certainly positive
[03:12:27.120 --> 03:12:31.840]  and then we have another video of her on her way to her bachelor party
[03:12:31.840 --> 03:12:35.680]  uh... and uh... here is that video my friends

[03:14:57.200 --> 03:15:01.760]  oh all right i'm gonna settle down now

[03:15:16.080 --> 03:15:20.400]  let me introduce charlie veitch and dan dicks
[03:15:20.400 --> 03:15:24.400]  uh and i know both the gentlemen charlie has the love police over in the
[03:15:24.400 --> 03:15:29.840]  uk traveled over to uh canada for the g20 and of
[03:15:29.840 --> 03:15:33.120]  course dan dicks has pressed for truth and has put out countless
[03:15:33.120 --> 03:15:36.480]  investigative reports on youtube that we routinely link to
[03:15:36.480 --> 03:15:39.520]  up at info wars dot com and prison planet dot com
[03:15:39.520 --> 03:15:45.200]  why is the g20 important well the 20 finance heads of the industrialized
[03:15:45.200 --> 03:15:49.840]  world who all uh just so happen uh to be former
[03:15:49.840 --> 03:15:53.440]  goldman sacks or j p morgan chaser bank of england operatives
[03:15:53.440 --> 03:15:59.040]  uh they always then come in a billion 200 millions being
[03:15:59.040 --> 03:16:02.720]  spent in canada it's a total police state they released police dogs on women
[03:16:02.720 --> 03:16:05.840]  in the u.s and pittsburgh marshal law for three days
[03:16:05.840 --> 03:16:09.440]  no one allowed outside randomly sound cannons attacking people
[03:16:09.440 --> 03:16:12.800]  college students couldn't even uh one of my reporters got arrested for no
[03:16:12.800 --> 03:16:16.400]  reason we have video of it in politely videotaping from a grassy
[03:16:16.400 --> 03:16:21.120]  hill and they come and arrest him and he watched lucredowski tortured
[03:16:21.120 --> 03:16:27.040]  in the military armory where they had him i mean this is this is real folks
[03:16:27.040 --> 03:16:31.280]  and so the banker criminals come to your town and they practice federalizing
[03:16:31.280 --> 03:16:36.080]  and all the local police that become spies spying on people at cafes
[03:16:36.080 --> 03:16:39.600]  listening to your political speech it's all over the news that they pass secret
[03:16:39.600 --> 03:16:43.680]  laws to just randomly arrest people and detain them in facilities with
[03:16:43.680 --> 03:16:47.520]  cameras over the toilets uh and so to tell us what's happened in the last three
[03:16:47.520 --> 03:16:51.600]  four days total as the global parasites come to town
[03:16:51.600 --> 03:16:55.200]  uh are these two gentlemen joining us via video skype
[03:16:55.200 --> 03:16:58.480]  uh so whoever wants to go first uh break down what's happening we
[03:16:58.480 --> 03:17:02.640]  we saw burning cars a lot of intel says that was a staged event the police
[03:17:02.640 --> 03:17:05.680]  made no effort to stop it but they will beat up any peaceful
[03:17:05.680 --> 03:17:09.200]  protester with pleasure or drag you off to their facility
[03:17:09.200 --> 03:17:12.560]  and it looks like we've caught the canadian police staging events before
[03:17:12.560 --> 03:17:16.320]  and the greek and the british and the uh italian and the us
[03:17:16.320 --> 03:17:20.960]  and so uh but that always comes out a few months later in court hearings
[03:17:20.960 --> 03:17:26.240]  uh what does this look like gentlemen well alex just uh yesterday uh right
[03:17:26.240 --> 03:17:31.040]  after we got off your show i got a call from one of our camera guys who um
[03:17:31.040 --> 03:17:36.000]  called me and said dan we're here at queen in spadina we've been surrounded
[03:17:36.000 --> 03:17:40.800]  by riot police and uh they were arresting and detaining everybody and
[03:17:40.800 --> 03:17:44.160]  everyone who was uh encircled in that intersection
[03:17:44.160 --> 03:17:51.520]  um 240 people were arrested round up detained and taken down uh town to what
[03:17:51.520 --> 03:17:56.560]  is now known as trontanimal bay and um it you know it's just it's just
[03:17:56.560 --> 03:18:00.000]  unbelievable charlie and i tried to get there as soon as we could
[03:18:00.000 --> 03:18:04.080]  to try to cover it but we were blocked at every single
[03:18:04.080 --> 03:18:08.240]  turn that we tried to get to the police said you you cannot get up there the
[03:18:08.240 --> 03:18:12.240]  street is now closed and um yeah 240 people were just
[03:18:12.240 --> 03:18:16.160]  rounded up and detained for peacefully just sitting there very
[03:18:16.160 --> 03:18:19.920]  peacefully protesting and of course it was all justified
[03:18:19.920 --> 03:18:24.000]  because of the actions that they said took place the previous day
[03:18:24.000 --> 03:18:29.040]  with burning police cars which is extremely extremely suspicious
[03:18:29.040 --> 03:18:32.240]  when you consider that these things were allowed to burn
[03:18:32.240 --> 03:18:36.160]  for the media photo op these cars were set on fire
[03:18:36.160 --> 03:18:41.200]  by the supposed black block anarchists and i've been sent a photo from a good
[03:18:41.200 --> 03:18:43.840]  friend of mine at nauresistance.org
[03:18:43.840 --> 03:18:48.080]  which shows that some of these black block guys had the same clubs
[03:18:48.080 --> 03:18:51.840]  that the police were using at the front of the riot line well i've seen the
[03:18:51.840 --> 03:18:54.880]  video and photos they look like cops and i said that
[03:18:54.880 --> 03:18:58.720]  two and a half years ago in montobello and headline royal amount of police
[03:18:58.720 --> 03:19:01.760]  admit that that was their officers i forget the exact headline but it's
[03:19:01.760 --> 03:19:04.960]  royal amount of police admit their officers attacked other officers
[03:19:04.960 --> 03:19:08.880]  for the media and we caught them in denver i said look like provocateurs
[03:19:08.880 --> 03:19:13.360]  denver post headline uh you know police opposed as anarchist
[03:19:13.360 --> 03:19:17.280]  attacked other police so they do this everywhere and
[03:19:17.280 --> 03:19:22.640]  if they're not cops we've proven their foundation funded they're flown in
[03:19:22.640 --> 03:19:25.840]  yeah that's exactly what we heard from any people here on the ground
[03:19:25.840 --> 03:19:30.240]  i think it's beyond any reasonable suspicion now that these people are
[03:19:30.240 --> 03:19:34.240]  agent provocateurs um either allowed to do this by the police
[03:19:34.240 --> 03:19:38.320]  or um actually police will stay there i want you guys to walk through what
[03:19:38.320 --> 03:19:41.840]  happened with this specifically and then get into other issues
[03:19:41.840 --> 03:19:45.840]  on the other side of this quick break but this has happened over and over and
[03:19:45.840 --> 03:19:49.680]  over again and it's meant to set a precedent to shut down our free speech
[03:19:49.680 --> 03:19:53.200]  the same thing has done worldwide ladies and gentlemen
[03:19:53.200 --> 03:19:58.000]  and they are bringing these people in i've had the anarchist tell me in austin
[03:19:58.000 --> 03:20:00.560]  that they do work for the feds that doesn't mean

[03:24:45.120 --> 03:24:49.120]  spying on everyone people are just taken away for no reason
[03:24:49.120 --> 03:24:53.920]  that's the headline secret law passed allows unlimited arrest
[03:24:53.920 --> 03:24:58.720]  and then magically the anarchists show up the police stand back as is in these
[03:24:58.720 --> 03:25:01.920]  new videos let them send police cars in fire
[03:25:01.920 --> 03:25:05.840]  that are parked there and then let the media see it and then they pull back and
[03:25:05.840 --> 03:25:09.040]  are left alone in the case of seattle and other cities
[03:25:09.040 --> 03:25:12.240]  you then catch them in government buildings
[03:25:12.240 --> 03:25:15.440]  or in other buildings protected by police
[03:25:15.440 --> 03:25:19.120]  and i don't know how cops go along with this well we've had cops speak up
[03:25:19.120 --> 03:25:22.640]  in canada and the u.s about it and in denver colorado that's what we know
[03:25:22.640 --> 03:25:25.040]  about it but going back to charlie veitch and dan
[03:25:25.040 --> 03:25:28.560]  dicks guys uh going back to this provocateur
[03:25:28.560 --> 03:25:33.680]  action i think that's most important tell us the intel you're getting
[03:25:33.680 --> 03:25:37.040]  uh well a very interesting thing that uh
[03:25:37.040 --> 03:25:41.040]  that happened charlie and i were in the middle of this particular protests
[03:25:41.040 --> 03:25:44.080]  where everybody got uh surrounded and um
[03:25:44.080 --> 03:25:48.080]  they had blocked the street on queen street leading up to spadina the area
[03:25:48.080 --> 03:25:52.320]  where one of the police cars was on fire and charlie got on the bullhorn
[03:25:52.320 --> 03:25:55.600]  and said you know if this line is blocked let's go north everybody
[03:25:55.600 --> 03:25:58.720]  so everybody started to go this way and then all of a sudden the police
[03:25:58.720 --> 03:26:01.840]  opened up the line and allowed everyone to go through
[03:26:01.840 --> 03:26:05.760]  almost like as if they wanted us to be in that particular area where that police
[03:26:05.760 --> 03:26:09.200]  car uh was on fire um because once we got the
[03:26:09.200 --> 03:26:12.800]  crowd to go in another direction they opened up the line and said well let
[03:26:12.800 --> 03:26:15.360]  them through so they let the hundreds and hundreds
[03:26:15.360 --> 03:26:18.080]  of protesters through where we were once blocked
[03:26:18.080 --> 03:26:23.120]  and uh moved us into the area where um the police car was on fire and that's
[03:26:23.120 --> 03:26:25.760]  where they blocked everyone in and detained us
[03:26:25.760 --> 03:26:29.440]  charlie and i lucky enough got out just at the right time because we came back
[03:26:29.440 --> 03:26:33.280]  to my place to do to do the show uh so we just missed that by a few
[03:26:33.280 --> 03:26:38.160]  that was part of the photo op down the road uh the the fed boys no
[03:26:38.160 --> 03:26:42.240]  doubt towards the police cars then they were like come on guys we need you we
[03:26:42.240 --> 03:26:46.000]  need the regular protesters there's a jail cell waiting for you
[03:26:46.000 --> 03:26:49.600]  you guys charlie just got out of jail the day before that morning
[03:26:49.600 --> 03:26:52.880]  now you guys duck out to come be interviewed by me last night and then
[03:26:52.880 --> 03:26:57.760]  right on time because they could then arrest their bad guys
[03:26:57.760 --> 03:27:02.000]  yeah absolutely alex um again we were under massive surveillance
[03:27:02.000 --> 03:27:05.440]  dan and i were getting pointed out by police officers they had their
[03:27:05.440 --> 03:27:08.720]  seven thousand dollar uh semi professional cameras
[03:27:08.720 --> 03:27:12.080]  and it's just uh for the grace of your show that we decided to duck out of
[03:27:12.080 --> 03:27:16.160]  this particular march and alex how do you feel about uh the
[03:27:16.160 --> 03:27:20.240]  predictive programming effects of uh almost 300 protesters being
[03:27:20.240 --> 03:27:24.640]  rounded up in an urban area onto buses and taken away to the to a detention
[03:27:24.640 --> 03:27:29.360]  camp well i mean they admit i've seen it in austin i've seen it in new york
[03:27:29.360 --> 03:27:32.800]  city for the rnc 2004 it's done for any of these
[03:27:32.800 --> 03:27:36.880]  high security events the exact same way they bring in their thugs they let them
[03:27:36.880 --> 03:27:40.160]  attack burn a few trash cans it always turns out their feds they leave
[03:27:40.160 --> 03:27:43.360]  they're protected and then an hour later a day later
[03:27:43.360 --> 03:27:46.960]  they then attack peaceful crowds saying that you were the ones that did it
[03:27:46.960 --> 03:27:49.680]  and i've walked up to these anarchists before and said you know i know you're
[03:27:49.680 --> 03:27:52.480]  fed they're like you're right we're gonna get you to
[03:27:52.480 --> 03:27:55.920]  and and usually they're communist uh you know under their outfit they'll have a
[03:27:55.920 --> 03:27:59.840]  big red star on and they're flown in by foundations paid for
[03:27:59.840 --> 03:28:03.520]  by uh you know big wealthy foundations but other times they're actual cops
[03:28:03.520 --> 03:28:06.640]  and i just hope people realize that the government's doing this is a form of
[03:28:06.640 --> 03:28:12.000]  false flag to demonize any type of demonstration
[03:28:12.000 --> 03:28:16.240]  yeah i i i just like to to take this opportunity to say to the people
[03:28:16.240 --> 03:28:19.520]  listening and um especially people in toronto
[03:28:19.520 --> 03:28:23.600]  uh if you were one of the 240 people who were arrested and detained and taken to
[03:28:23.600 --> 03:28:26.560]  the camp uh please get in touch with me at dan at
[03:28:26.560 --> 03:28:30.960]  press for truth dot ca we would like to interview you about what happened
[03:28:30.960 --> 03:28:34.640]  and so that we can get your story uh out to the world because it's extremely
[03:28:34.640 --> 03:28:37.840]  important what took place here yesterday oh it's incredibly important
[03:28:37.840 --> 03:28:41.360]  and we've had callers today one of them who said they were on a train
[03:28:41.360 --> 03:28:45.680]  and there was like a plainclothes security woman who sat down next to them
[03:28:45.680 --> 03:28:48.080]  and listened to them they weren't even in you know wearing demonstration
[03:28:48.080 --> 03:28:51.760]  outfits or bandanas or anything and then when the train stopped
[03:28:51.760 --> 03:28:55.520]  she got off and pointed at them and then police ran up and
[03:28:55.520 --> 03:28:59.040]  interrogated them for almost an hour and then went ahead and just randomly
[03:28:59.040 --> 03:29:04.320]  arrested uh one of the people and so uh i mean this is secret police this is
[03:29:04.320 --> 03:29:08.080]  east germany but there was actually raids going on
[03:29:08.080 --> 03:29:11.520]  all over the city um the university of toronto campus
[03:29:11.520 --> 03:29:16.000]  uh was raided uh i believe it was a day ago or maybe two days ago where
[03:29:16.000 --> 03:29:20.960]  70 students at u of t uh you know riot cops just came in and raided their
[03:29:20.960 --> 03:29:24.960]  campus and arrested them all um suggesting that they were
[03:29:24.960 --> 03:29:29.360]  potentially going to cause violence the following day
[03:29:29.360 --> 03:29:36.000]  and then magically there was a fire oh right on cue yeah i just like to thank
[03:29:36.000 --> 03:29:39.920]  the scumbag idiots who gave the police these orders because they are really
[03:29:39.920 --> 03:29:43.360]  helping the global awakening with their sloppy job
[03:29:43.360 --> 03:29:47.440]  and exposing the illusion that these people are on our side to try and help
[03:29:47.440 --> 03:29:50.560]  us it's not except never the 11th well stay there stay there let's talk

[03:32:03.360 --> 03:32:07.360]  solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily
[03:32:07.360 --> 03:32:11.120]  double or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are
[03:32:11.120 --> 03:32:14.720]  wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have
[03:32:14.720 --> 03:32:18.960]  it's true total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid
[03:32:18.960 --> 03:32:22.160]  technology is coming number three in some areas of the
[03:32:22.160 --> 03:32:24.800]  country the power grid is dangerously overloaded
[03:32:24.800 --> 03:32:28.720]  and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem
[03:32:28.720 --> 03:32:32.240]  number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids
[03:32:32.240 --> 03:32:35.360]  every year thousands of families lose their power from weather-related
[03:32:35.360 --> 03:32:38.400]  onages number five a solar power generator provides
[03:32:38.400 --> 03:32:41.920]  powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks i really believe in the
[03:32:41.920 --> 03:32:44.480]  solar power generators offered by solutions from science
[03:32:44.480 --> 03:32:47.440]  one of my oldest sponsors you can get more information at

[03:33:13.760 --> 03:33:16.640]  ladies and gentlemen we're not just talking about what's happening in
[03:33:16.640 --> 03:33:20.720]  toronto by itself it's all interconnected you've
[03:33:20.720 --> 03:33:24.080]  got all this mainstream news where the white house says yeah we're taking over
[03:33:24.080 --> 03:33:26.400]  the internet you've got all these white house officials
[03:33:26.400 --> 03:33:28.560]  saying you have no right to a second amendment
[03:33:28.560 --> 03:33:33.040]  no right to free speech uh that they want to arrest people that criticize the
[03:33:33.040 --> 03:33:36.560]  government uh you've got a banking bill
[03:33:36.560 --> 03:33:40.640]  that's passed the senate committee and is going to go to the full
[03:33:40.640 --> 03:33:44.720]  senate uh that literally gives the federal reserve in the words of the
[03:33:44.720 --> 03:33:50.960]  washington post near unlimited power to make whatever
[03:33:50.960 --> 03:33:54.320]  regulations they want over other banks
[03:33:54.320 --> 03:33:59.120]  the total takeover i mean this is a seizure this is the same as
[03:33:59.120 --> 03:34:03.840]  a foreign army landing on our shores this is a corporate global government
[03:34:03.840 --> 03:34:07.600]  and everywhere they go it's the same shaken bank i watched them kick it off
[03:34:07.600 --> 03:34:12.240]  in 99 in seattle it's in my film police state to the takeover
[03:34:12.240 --> 03:34:17.040]  and they took people to the sand point fema naval brig uh there is your fema
[03:34:17.040 --> 03:34:20.080]  camp right there and they took him to the sand
[03:34:20.080 --> 03:34:23.440]  point fema naval brig and kept hundreds of
[03:34:23.440 --> 03:34:26.960]  peaceful protesters and i have the police on the news saying
[03:34:26.960 --> 03:34:30.960]  no one is allowed to have an anti-wto sticker or button
[03:34:30.960 --> 03:34:35.360]  and we have cops pulling women's cars over looking for
[03:34:35.360 --> 03:34:39.360]  uh anti-wto buttons and when they don't find them they go ahead and pepper
[03:34:39.360 --> 03:34:42.160]  sprayed them i mean this is the insane mental illness
[03:34:42.160 --> 03:34:46.320]  all because they hired less than 50 thugs that were admittedly
[03:34:46.320 --> 03:34:48.800]  because later police came out and talked about it we have the interviews with
[03:34:48.800 --> 03:34:52.560]  them hired by a federal government funded foundation
[03:34:52.560 --> 03:34:56.240]  that then came into town and then were housed in a government building
[03:34:56.240 --> 03:34:58.480]  after they did their one day of attacking people
[03:34:58.480 --> 03:35:02.320]  then the cops were released on the peaceful crowds this is a system
[03:35:02.320 --> 03:35:06.640]  that's why you don't see big people being big crowds out demonstrating
[03:35:06.640 --> 03:35:11.040]  it's simple you go out and demonstrate now uh in especially against the
[03:35:11.040 --> 03:35:13.840]  globalist or the world trade organization or anything new world order
[03:35:13.840 --> 03:35:17.120]  they just hire thugs to come burn a police car and then
[03:35:17.120 --> 03:35:22.080]  they retreat the police attack you and they put it on the news that you did it
[03:35:22.080 --> 03:35:24.880]  and that's why we're going to hell in a handbasket
[03:35:24.880 --> 03:35:27.920]  but there's other ways to protest you can put up handbills
[03:35:27.920 --> 03:35:31.840]  on telephone polls you can call and talk radio you can start websites access tv
[03:35:31.840 --> 03:35:34.880]  go to your city council go to your county commissioners court go to your
[03:35:34.880 --> 03:35:39.200]  state house you can educate people you can unlock minds and everyone
[03:35:39.200 --> 03:35:44.240]  passive aggressively can stop going along with the system and start not
[03:35:44.240 --> 03:35:47.680]  complying and then that's they only get away with this
[03:35:47.680 --> 03:35:52.400]  by us complying with them and i'm telling you got to see yourselves as agents of
[03:35:52.400 --> 03:35:57.680]  liberty 1776 inside enemy operations everywhere you are
[03:35:57.680 --> 03:36:01.520]  every person that you walk by is an opportunity to unlock a mind
[03:36:01.520 --> 03:36:04.000]  everyone you see on the street is an opportunity
[03:36:04.000 --> 03:36:07.440]  every cop you see is an opportunity to inform somebody
[03:36:07.440 --> 03:36:12.080]  uh there are so many things you can do so many things i mean i know a lot of
[03:36:12.080 --> 03:36:15.600]  people now that are just putting um they're not fake
[03:36:15.600 --> 03:36:19.200]  they're just putting their own license plate on
[03:36:19.200 --> 03:36:22.640]  and let's see the foreign toll roads work on that
[03:36:22.640 --> 03:36:25.600]  there are people putting up micro fm known as pirate stations that don't
[03:36:25.600 --> 03:36:28.160]  interfere with commercial stations and they're putting out the truth they
[03:36:28.160 --> 03:36:31.200]  don't care people aren't going along with it they're not
[03:36:31.200 --> 03:36:34.960]  being told what to do by a group of offshore banks looting and robbing us
[03:36:34.960 --> 03:36:37.840]  going back to charlie veitch and dan dicks both
[03:36:37.840 --> 03:36:42.320]  accomplished alternative media journalist and an activist out there
[03:36:42.320 --> 03:36:47.440]  about what we saw happen in toronto now i guess we didn't have any police dogs
[03:36:47.440 --> 03:36:51.760]  though biting old women coming out of grocery stores with daytime curfews
[03:36:51.760 --> 03:36:57.520]  i guess we haven't seen um you know any of that type of behavior we haven't seen
[03:36:57.520 --> 03:37:01.440]  sound cannons out so it i mean it does sound like you guys are only
[03:37:01.440 --> 03:37:04.800]  getting uh uh you know a light helping of ultra
[03:37:04.800 --> 03:37:09.600]  police state versus what happened in the u.s i guess so alex i guess um maybe
[03:37:09.600 --> 03:37:13.440]  they're trying to keep their uh pr under control after the absolute
[03:37:13.440 --> 03:37:16.240]  disaster that was pittsburgh with uh lute
[03:37:16.240 --> 03:37:20.480]  rudowski being arrested there um you mentioned in the a few segments ago
[03:37:20.480 --> 03:37:24.800]  about cnn talking about uh seizures happening from vaccines well
[03:37:24.800 --> 03:37:28.800]  interestingly enough we're now seeing in toronto the mainstream media is
[03:37:28.800 --> 03:37:32.320]  turning on the government and turning against the police because
[03:37:32.320 --> 03:37:38.080]  a few ctv uh reporters were rounded up hogtide thrown into a bus in the pouring
[03:37:38.080 --> 03:37:42.800]  rain and taken to guantanamo bay as well and on the outskirts of toronto so
[03:37:42.800 --> 03:37:46.000]  as you see in america the viewership for the mainstream media is collapsing and
[03:37:46.000 --> 03:37:48.960]  now in canada we're seeing the corporate controlled media
[03:37:48.960 --> 03:37:54.080]  turn against their uh their masters so it's a beautiful thing and ctv reported
[03:37:54.080 --> 03:37:57.120]  uh in one of their articles in fact you guys printed for me but i can't find it
[03:37:57.120 --> 03:38:00.720]  we printed again actually rob do brought it in at the end of the article
[03:38:00.720 --> 03:38:05.760]  they talk about how it appeared the police did nothing to stop the people
[03:38:05.760 --> 03:38:08.880]  burning the cars so they're kind of beginning to
[03:38:08.880 --> 03:38:12.240]  start investigating what really happened there
[03:38:12.240 --> 03:38:15.440]  yeah it seems to be a big turning point but i guess all these events are big
[03:38:15.440 --> 03:38:19.600]  turning points but i need to i need to really we need to speak out the good
[03:38:19.600 --> 03:38:24.400]  people who might be working alongside the g20 puppet masters are in the police
[03:38:24.400 --> 03:38:29.120]  why are the good people not speaking out what are they scared of why are they
[03:38:29.120 --> 03:38:32.240]  under this control
[03:38:32.240 --> 03:38:34.640]  well they feel like they're the winners they feel like they're on the winning
[03:38:34.640 --> 03:38:38.400]  team and even if they lean towards liberty a little bit
[03:38:38.400 --> 03:38:42.560]  they still think it's safer to sit on the sideline no things are too dark things
[03:38:42.560 --> 03:38:46.240]  are getting too serious folks we're entering a very dangerous time
[03:38:46.240 --> 03:38:51.040]  all of you need to do whatever you can whether it's getting information out
[03:38:51.040 --> 03:38:54.960]  if you're a police officer you know about a unit of police that was assigned
[03:38:54.960 --> 03:39:00.720]  to help these private contractor anarchists come in
[03:39:00.720 --> 03:39:04.160]  just like they use an anarchist to start world war one or an anarchist to bomb
[03:39:04.160 --> 03:39:08.320]  wall street that was the bankers doing that an anarchist is just an agent of
[03:39:08.320 --> 03:39:13.040]  chaos so the system can come in i don't mean an anarchist in its true
[03:39:13.040 --> 03:39:17.280]  sense i mean these people calling themselves anarchist
[03:39:17.280 --> 03:39:22.640]  are normally just communist youth brigade people brought in by foundations
[03:39:22.640 --> 03:39:26.480]  absolutely alex i like to call myself a philosophical anarchist i believe in the
[03:39:26.480 --> 03:39:29.920]  true ideals of anarchism against big government
[03:39:29.920 --> 03:39:34.880]  but these are black block children most of them were very young
[03:39:34.880 --> 03:39:38.240]  um they were just there oh we're here to commit crime we're here to just smash
[03:39:38.240 --> 03:39:42.800]  things up they're they're just idiots and i wish i was able to confront some of
[03:39:42.800 --> 03:39:46.080]  them but strangely enough the police didn't let us get anywhere near them
[03:39:46.080 --> 03:39:50.240]  because they were protecting them so uh that's the way these things go
[03:39:50.240 --> 03:39:54.080]  well that's how they got caught in denver that's how they got caught in
[03:39:54.080 --> 03:39:57.120]  seattle and in canada two and a half years ago
[03:39:57.120 --> 03:40:00.640]  in monobello for those that want to look it up was that
[03:40:00.640 --> 03:40:04.560]  they would then slip behind the police lines and be protected
[03:40:04.560 --> 03:40:08.560]  because i myself for ten years and many others since then
[03:40:08.560 --> 03:40:12.240]  have been pointing out follow the anarchists follow them
[03:40:12.240 --> 03:40:16.240]  nine times out of ten they're going to end up going to a police substation
[03:40:16.240 --> 03:40:19.680]  find them and it's a devastating blow against the new world order
[03:40:19.680 --> 03:40:23.600]  if we can only bust them a few more times then everyone will know
[03:40:23.600 --> 03:40:27.200]  that it is the government doing it and we've almost gotten to that game over
[03:40:27.200 --> 03:40:31.280]  point because we've caught them so many times but now the police are countering
[03:40:31.280 --> 03:40:34.400]  that really protecting their operatives
[03:40:34.400 --> 03:40:38.960]  yeah if anyone's interested in learning about what happened in monobello
[03:40:38.960 --> 03:40:42.560]  uh they can check out a film i produced called the nation's deathbed we
[03:40:42.560 --> 03:40:45.440]  documented the entire event that took place there
[03:40:45.440 --> 03:40:48.960]  and me and charlie have been working hard at the g20 to document everything
[03:40:48.960 --> 03:40:51.840]  that's going on but the powers that be have
[03:40:51.840 --> 03:40:55.360]  been trying to stifle our efforts on the key day
[03:40:55.360 --> 03:41:00.240]  my website went down anytime i try to have any communications with some of my
[03:41:00.240 --> 03:41:03.520]  camera guys my cell phone would just drop out
[03:41:03.520 --> 03:41:07.120]  when i came back to try to upload raw footage to youtube
[03:41:07.120 --> 03:41:11.440]  entire three four minute chunks were cut out and all the audio was out of sync
[03:41:11.440 --> 03:41:15.280]  so i was forced to put it on the press for truth facebook group
[03:41:15.280 --> 03:41:18.880]  so there are clearly people out there trying to stop
[03:41:18.880 --> 03:41:22.640]  independent journalists from getting the truth out about what actually happened
[03:41:22.640 --> 03:41:26.080]  in in downtown toronto well that's a central point that you just
[03:41:26.080 --> 03:41:28.960]  raised there because when i was at bill derberg
[03:41:28.960 --> 03:41:33.520]  2008 covering it we knew obama was coming he shook the media
[03:41:33.520 --> 03:41:36.960]  he was there the media for two days ran around like idiots
[03:41:36.960 --> 03:41:40.880]  trying to find out where he was we knew we told them we call local newspapers
[03:41:40.880 --> 03:41:43.200]  and they just said we're not allowed to report
[03:41:43.200 --> 03:41:46.720]  uh but the day before they threw us out
[03:41:46.720 --> 03:41:52.000]  all of this nsa and massad and military personnel and secret service were
[03:41:52.000 --> 03:41:55.360]  taking over the ballrooms and side offices and had
[03:41:55.360 --> 03:41:58.640]  surveillance equipment and i actually walked by rooms
[03:41:58.640 --> 03:42:02.480]  and heard them knowing i'm going to get that navy satellite well how do you
[03:42:02.480 --> 03:42:05.680]  patch through on the army satellite wait i've got him i've got him
[03:42:05.680 --> 03:42:08.880]  yeah we've got protesters out at the front and i'd be sitting there getting a
[03:42:08.880 --> 03:42:14.560]  gatorade in the gift shop and there'd be an office
[03:42:14.560 --> 03:42:18.640]  listening to i mean just spooks running around everywhere
[03:42:18.640 --> 03:42:23.760]  and then i would try to call my guys and they somebody pop on the line and
[03:42:23.760 --> 03:42:27.120]  laugh at us then cut it off my cell phone i'd call my
[03:42:27.120 --> 03:42:30.960]  wife and say something to her and they call her up and make threats at her and
[03:42:30.960 --> 03:42:34.880]  tell her what we just talked about so she knew it was the government
[03:42:34.880 --> 03:42:39.920]  um so yes when you have these special national security international
[03:42:39.920 --> 03:42:43.840]  security events that cost 1.2 billion in security
[03:42:43.840 --> 03:42:47.040]  they're bringing in private contractors by the tens of thousands
[03:42:47.040 --> 03:42:51.840]  it's a giant exercise in google type technology which they now admit is
[03:42:51.840 --> 03:42:54.000]  illegal and states are looking at indicting them
[03:42:54.000 --> 03:42:57.280]  scooping up everybody's digital transmissions and decoding them without
[03:42:57.280 --> 03:43:02.240]  warrants uh we had g20 security call us
[03:43:02.240 --> 03:43:05.920]  when we saw the footage of the guy being grabbed in pittsburgh and crammed into a
[03:43:05.920 --> 03:43:09.600]  car by guys in military uniforms into a champagne police car
[03:43:09.600 --> 03:43:12.960]  and it went up on drudge report and and people are saying you know snatch and
[03:43:12.960 --> 03:43:16.000]  grab goons kidnap activists for no reason
[03:43:16.000 --> 03:43:19.520]  and they put a press release out first they called us and i could hardly
[03:43:19.520 --> 03:43:23.840]  believe it but i called the number it was g20 security in pittsburgh
[03:43:23.840 --> 03:43:27.280]  and i talked to him and they said no mr jones that video is our private
[03:43:27.280 --> 03:43:31.120]  security personnel authorized by city emergency code and they said it
[03:43:31.120 --> 03:43:35.760]  to be detaining active troublemakers and
[03:43:35.760 --> 03:43:39.760]  but the issue is we later learned because i could tell by the video was fake
[03:43:39.760 --> 03:43:45.120]  they were out with their own operatives grabbing protesters out of crowds to
[03:43:45.120 --> 03:43:49.680]  create a psi op and scare people so it's so it's all about theater of the mind
[03:43:49.680 --> 03:43:53.440]  what charlie veich was just saying about selling you
[03:43:53.440 --> 03:43:56.480]  that you're going to be snatched you're going to be grabbed don't come out to
[03:43:56.480 --> 03:44:00.080]  these don't mess with the bankers and of course
[03:44:00.080 --> 03:44:03.840]  they're patched into youtube of course they're editing what you're doing
[03:44:03.840 --> 03:44:08.800]  this is an exercise in warring against us we're the legitimate people saying we
[03:44:08.800 --> 03:44:10.960]  don't want to be raped by the foreign banks
[03:44:10.960 --> 03:44:15.200]  we don't want to go into serfdom like grease or iceland and they're saying no
[03:44:15.200 --> 03:44:19.200]  you're going to feel our full might and so they are testing and they admit this
[03:44:19.200 --> 03:44:23.600]  at each of these events how to bring in their internationalization of a city
[03:44:23.600 --> 03:44:28.320]  how to have secret police how to have their criminal operation dominate
[03:44:28.320 --> 03:44:32.240]  everyone this is about the city and your state
[03:44:32.240 --> 03:44:35.920]  your region your country going under globalist control
[03:44:35.920 --> 03:44:40.240]  and they are under globalist control in these events this is about your city
[03:44:40.240 --> 03:44:44.560]  going under foreign private corporate control go ahead
[03:44:44.560 --> 03:44:47.840]  yeah i'd just like to just touch upon that as well alex the
[03:44:47.840 --> 03:44:51.760]  i'm just so proud of the toronto residents and the other associated
[03:44:51.760 --> 03:44:54.880]  protesters for the incredible restraint they showed
[03:44:54.880 --> 03:44:58.960]  amidst such a police thuggery the new world order they want
[03:44:58.960 --> 03:45:02.400]  a violent response from the public right now to further
[03:45:02.400 --> 03:45:06.960]  speed up their imposition of this technotronic advanced slave society
[03:45:06.960 --> 03:45:10.160]  i believe right now is what you're doing alex is what dan is doing is what i'm
[03:45:10.160 --> 03:45:13.040]  doing right now we need to unlock people's minds wake them up
[03:45:13.040 --> 03:45:16.800]  but i just want to give a warning to the new world order that death worshiping
[03:45:16.800 --> 03:45:19.840]  fascism has always failed throughout history
[03:45:19.840 --> 03:45:25.520]  and as long as tyrants die um liberty will never be stopped throughout history
[03:45:25.520 --> 03:45:29.680]  we've always won and we are guided we are divinely guided and we will do
[03:45:29.680 --> 03:45:33.040]  whatever it takes if they become much more fascist
[03:45:33.040 --> 03:45:37.360]  we will resist the same way that they resisted in world war two europe we will
[03:45:37.360 --> 03:45:41.040]  do whatever it takes to defend what we believe in because we are human beings
[03:45:41.040 --> 03:45:45.440]  our lives have value and we will not take it but right now they're not
[03:45:45.440 --> 03:45:48.480]  forcing people to join the armed forces and not forcing people to go into
[03:45:48.480 --> 03:45:51.360]  mcdonalds they're not forcing people to take vaccinations
[03:45:51.360 --> 03:45:54.400]  they're using mind control well they're trying though they're starting to get
[03:45:54.400 --> 03:45:58.640]  ready for that though yeah
[03:46:00.080 --> 03:46:02.720]  well gentlemen other points that both of you want to make about what you
[03:46:02.720 --> 03:46:06.560]  witnessed while you're there absolutely um
[03:46:06.560 --> 03:46:10.480]  whilst we were running down to queen in spadina to cover the um
[03:46:10.480 --> 03:46:16.480]  mass concentration camp round up for those 244 reporters and civilians um
[03:46:16.480 --> 03:46:21.120]  dan and i got searched about three times and there was a a boy must have been
[03:46:21.120 --> 03:46:24.560]  about 17 years old who was running through the rain he was giving us a
[03:46:24.560 --> 03:46:28.240]  quick interview and then an unmarked car came blasting
[03:46:28.240 --> 03:46:32.320]  around the corner six officers jumped out and snatched him off the street in
[03:46:32.320 --> 03:46:36.000]  front of us and then one of the officers in fact all six of them came into our
[03:46:36.000 --> 03:46:39.920]  little uh cubbyhole away from the rain and they started pointing at dan saying
[03:46:39.920 --> 03:46:42.960]  oh yeah we know you you're a known conspiracy theorist
[03:46:42.960 --> 03:46:46.960]  oh yeah and we know alex jones uh he's a he's that tinfoil hat wearer so they
[03:46:46.960 --> 03:46:50.640]  were mentioning you as well alex so you can imagine the intelligence reports
[03:46:50.640 --> 03:46:54.240]  they get given about people like us about how we're just crazy
[03:46:54.240 --> 03:46:58.880]  paranoid anti-government uh loonies i guess
[03:46:58.880 --> 03:47:04.000]  goldman sacks hasn't stolen 600 trillion according to the washington post i
[03:47:04.000 --> 03:47:06.640]  i guess we're not going into a depression i guess
[03:47:06.640 --> 03:47:11.760]  they didn't lie about wmds i guess they're not torturing people i guess
[03:47:11.760 --> 03:47:17.440]  i mean don't these police understand what they're helping to build
[03:47:17.440 --> 03:47:20.720]  i don't think they all do i think uh as we saw
[03:47:20.720 --> 03:47:24.960]  a lot of them are chosen for their obedience psychological acquiescence to
[03:47:24.960 --> 03:47:28.800]  power as alan watt from cutting through the matrix talks about in the
[03:47:28.800 --> 03:47:32.720]  psychopathic hierarchy of control they worship people more powerful than them
[03:47:32.720 --> 03:47:36.000]  and they hate people less powerful like like the general public
[03:47:36.000 --> 03:47:39.440]  so it is a kind of egomaniac sadomasochist
[03:47:39.440 --> 03:47:43.040]  enjoyment of power which well it is a power trip i mean i mean a lot of these
[03:47:43.040 --> 03:47:46.240]  people who do work for the government
[03:47:46.240 --> 03:47:50.000]  uh never had success in life and suddenly they're given a badge a gun all
[03:47:50.000 --> 03:47:54.640]  this power and but i mean it's coming out
[03:47:54.640 --> 03:47:57.520]  everywhere that everything we've talked about is true
[03:47:57.520 --> 03:48:00.960]  and they would say five years ago that i was a kook that there was you know they
[03:48:00.960 --> 03:48:03.920]  weren't going to set up cyber security when i'd read the pentagon plans for it
[03:48:03.920 --> 03:48:06.880]  that were public and now they're openly saying yes we're going to
[03:48:06.880 --> 03:48:10.480]  track you yes we're going to spy on you yes we're going to shut you down
[03:48:10.480 --> 03:48:14.160]  yes we want to arrest people that tell conspiracy theories i mean what do they
[03:48:14.160 --> 03:48:16.720]  think is going to happen when they start trying to arrest people for their
[03:48:16.720 --> 03:48:20.560]  speech everybody's been fighting as hard as they can to keep this peaceful
[03:48:20.560 --> 03:48:24.160]  but i don't think they realize we're not the poor disarm russian peasants
[03:48:24.160 --> 03:48:29.440]  we're not the disarm germans uh and not everybody is a potbelly decadent slob
[03:48:29.440 --> 03:48:33.120]  i mean i don't think all these little kids in black uniforms realize
[03:48:33.120 --> 03:48:36.480]  that they are really starting something that isn't going to end well
[03:48:36.480 --> 03:48:41.680]  now i agree with you alex 100 percent across the world i think people are
[03:48:41.680 --> 03:48:46.400]  ready to do whatever it takes because we've got nothing left to lose i mean
[03:48:46.400 --> 03:48:49.520]  they've taken away everything and they're trying to take away the very last
[03:48:49.520 --> 03:48:53.840]  vestiges of our freedom so we need to ask ourselves are we human beings or are
[03:48:53.840 --> 03:48:57.200]  we slaves and it's a fundamental point i truly believe that
[03:48:57.200 --> 03:49:01.600]  the victory is already half won the moment we spiritually and psychologically
[03:49:01.600 --> 03:49:04.640]  say that we will not take it anymore well i agree with you we've got to get
[03:49:04.640 --> 03:49:07.680]  angry we've got to get comfortable speaking out in public
[03:49:07.680 --> 03:49:11.200]  and we've got to get really aggressive at info war not just with t-shirts or
[03:49:11.200 --> 03:49:14.640]  banner hangs on highways what one person can do in their neighborhood putting
[03:49:14.640 --> 03:49:17.920]  up a hundred you know simple computer printouts black
[03:49:17.920 --> 03:49:22.160]  and white with a message or a website or micro fm or am
[03:49:22.160 --> 03:49:27.280]  or or you know uh local you know uh tv broadcast that go into a few
[03:49:27.280 --> 03:49:30.960]  neighborhoods or i mean people have just got to make a
[03:49:30.960 --> 03:49:36.240]  scene they've got to get aggressive and every day videos and and and articles
[03:49:36.240 --> 03:49:39.520]  and information gets sent to us that people are producing
[03:49:39.520 --> 03:49:42.080]  that does get the word out and of the artist
[03:49:42.080 --> 03:49:45.840]  and and and people just turn their power loose i mean who's that artist that
[03:49:45.840 --> 03:49:49.680]  goes up and paints billboards with anti-corporate messages
[03:49:49.680 --> 03:49:54.240]  banksy i think one of them's english is his last name
[03:49:54.240 --> 03:49:58.960]  yeah his name is uh banksy yeah uh and i'm not saying people should do that
[03:49:58.960 --> 03:50:03.280]  in face of this tyranny but my point is we haven't even begun to fight
[03:50:03.280 --> 03:50:07.280]  we haven't begun to take everything back and they're trying to intimidate us
[03:50:07.280 --> 03:50:09.440]  now they're trying to beat us into submission
[03:50:09.440 --> 03:50:13.520]  they're trying to sell us on shutting up because we do have power
[03:50:13.520 --> 03:50:18.640]  and so the answer is don't shut up when they intimidate us get 10 times louder
[03:50:18.640 --> 03:50:22.960]  now absolutely and i just like to say if um if anyone who is prominent in the
[03:50:22.960 --> 03:50:27.040]  truth movement gets arrested or detained for some rubbish reason
[03:50:27.040 --> 03:50:31.600]  i would really like to see a mass jailbreak of thousands of people just
[03:50:31.600 --> 03:50:34.800]  turning up outside this prison and really putting the prison guards on the
[03:50:34.800 --> 03:50:38.640]  spot because there's something about vast numbers of people which really
[03:50:38.640 --> 03:50:43.280]  terrifies the black paramilitary psychopathic lower level security
[03:50:43.280 --> 03:50:47.600]  agents and when they see that people will not stand up for this kind of tyranny
[03:50:47.600 --> 03:50:52.640]  in one massive movement then they might be suddenly educated
[03:50:52.640 --> 03:50:55.920]  well they need to pick a side i mean this is tyranny period it's time for
[03:50:55.920 --> 03:50:58.800]  these people to quit laughing at us they need to make a decision
[03:50:58.800 --> 03:51:01.440]  well they're right back

[03:54:29.760 --> 03:54:34.160]  this is systematic twisting of our police systematic twisting
[03:54:34.160 --> 03:54:38.560]  of the citizenry in the media to accept all of this
[03:54:38.560 --> 03:54:43.040]  the good news is i'm seeing even the new york times in the wall street journal
[03:54:43.040 --> 03:54:47.040]  admit that this is an engineered depression
[03:54:47.040 --> 03:54:50.240]  because not everyone in media and government is controlled they're
[03:54:50.240 --> 03:54:55.440]  compartmentalized and controlled by the propaganda once the propaganda you know
[03:54:55.440 --> 03:54:59.040]  the the sleeping gas is sucked out of the room
[03:54:59.040 --> 03:55:03.520]  people start waking up most people are not truly evil
[03:55:03.520 --> 03:55:06.880]  when you talk about a dick cheney or a george bush or a
[03:55:06.880 --> 03:55:11.440]  cast sunstein those people are evil because we have their writings
[03:55:11.440 --> 03:55:16.160]  uh... obama is evil i mean he's continuing the torture the wars
[03:55:16.160 --> 03:55:19.920]  uh... saying it's good they know i mean these are people
[03:55:19.920 --> 03:55:24.720]  they've got again legislation introduced to arrest citizens for any reason and
[03:55:24.720 --> 03:55:27.360]  have you disappear into a black hole
[03:55:27.360 --> 03:55:30.800]  the same thing in england and i keep repeating that because you know it's
[03:55:30.800 --> 03:55:35.600]  now mainstream news we have 46 states here's bloomberg
[03:55:35.600 --> 03:55:40.160]  going bankrupt 46 states do you i mean that's why they've been
[03:55:40.160 --> 03:55:43.680]  you notice as soon as they started selling derivatives in 99 they try to set
[03:55:43.680 --> 03:55:47.840]  up a police state because the imf and world bank have done this in countless
[03:55:47.840 --> 03:55:52.000]  third world countries they've done this over and over and over again
[03:55:52.000 --> 03:55:56.320]  they know what they're doing and they know you're going to end up
[03:55:56.320 --> 03:56:00.000]  rioting so i don't want violence just like these anarchists
[03:56:00.000 --> 03:56:04.080]  uh... you know gave the system a pretext to crack down
[03:56:04.080 --> 03:56:08.400]  we want to peacefully go out and and and and get the moral high ground and point
[03:56:08.400 --> 03:56:12.240]  out to the general public who the real criminals are
[03:56:12.240 --> 03:56:16.560]  but down the road they start trying to arrest political dissidents and take us
[03:56:16.560 --> 03:56:20.800]  to death dungeons it's gonna be like robin hood all over again people aren't
[03:56:20.800 --> 03:56:25.760]  going to have a choice and you will start seeing black arrows flying
[03:56:25.760 --> 03:56:29.760]  and uh... that's what happens when the badge and the government becomes a
[03:56:29.760 --> 03:56:33.520]  complete tyranny i'm fighting to avert this
[03:56:33.520 --> 03:56:38.720]  as hard as i can but as uh... jfk said those that make peaceful
[03:56:38.720 --> 03:56:42.720]  revolutions impossible make violent revolutions inevitable
[03:56:42.720 --> 03:56:45.920]  or those that make peaceful change impossible make violent revolutions
[03:56:45.920 --> 03:56:49.440]  inevitable i'm paraphrasing it uh... but going back to charlie veitch and uh...
[03:56:49.440 --> 03:56:52.640]  dan dicks again our websites are info wars dot com and
[03:56:52.640 --> 03:56:55.440]  present planet dot com but it's very important to contact those guys up in
[03:56:55.440 --> 03:56:58.240]  canada especially dan dicks because uh...
[03:56:58.240 --> 03:57:01.200]  he'll be able to put together he's a good filmmaker
[03:57:01.200 --> 03:57:06.320]  uh... a piece that will be able to live on and inspire people to
[03:57:06.320 --> 03:57:08.720]  understand what the g20 does when they come to their area
[03:57:08.720 --> 03:57:11.520]  guys we're almost out of time but i wanted to go back to dan dicks and just
[03:57:11.520 --> 03:57:17.760]  say this uh... dan uh... specifically the the
[03:57:17.760 --> 03:57:22.080]  the police knew who you were and who charlie was and they were also
[03:57:22.080 --> 03:57:27.760]  concerned about me yeah absolutely uh... i've been approached
[03:57:27.760 --> 03:57:30.800]  i don't know thirty or forty times uh... by police
[03:57:30.800 --> 03:57:35.280]  uh... ninety five percent of them uh... look like they don't like me or what i
[03:57:35.280 --> 03:57:39.120]  do there is a very small percentage of guys who would be like hey you're that
[03:57:39.120 --> 03:57:43.120]  gay right on uh... very small percentage of the police seem to
[03:57:43.120 --> 03:57:46.320]  like what i do uh... but definitely i'm i'm i'm getting wrecked
[03:57:46.320 --> 03:57:49.920]  recognize now because of the videos uh... we are going to be putting up a new
