[00:00.000 --> 00:11.000]  Waging War on Corruption. It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the Info War.
[00:30.000 --> 00:50.000]  It's Thursday April 4th, 2019 under host Alex Jones. Well I just walked in there about two minutes ago before I went live and I
[00:50.000 --> 01:03.000]  wrote the headline for the page we post every day that has the show in it so people can share the audio and video link and the headline states the facts.
[01:03.000 --> 01:17.000]  The planet is only six months away from total civilizational collapse. Already in most areas of the world what civilization was built is collapsing.
[01:17.000 --> 01:43.000]  It's being done by design and if we act quickly it can be averted, it can be changed. But you notice the talking point out of the EU, the talking point out of the UN, the talking point out of AOC, the talking point out of BTO, O'Rourke is that the earth will completely be uninhabitable and that we will all be dead within 12 years.
[01:43.000 --> 02:02.000]  Now you understand they didn't just cook that up, they didn't just pull that out of their rear end. They are purposely, they are purposely engineering this situation.
[02:02.000 --> 02:19.000]  And I want to lay it out in the next segment exactly what the globalists are planning so that people understand that as it begins to unfold we have a chance to A. blame who's behind it and B. stop it.
[02:19.000 --> 02:43.000]  So we sit here and we laugh at AOC and we laugh at BTO but you understand, ladies and gentlemen, that if you go watch my film in game blueprint for global enslavement 2007, I have the quotes in the video clips of the Bilderberg group, the UN, all of them saying that.
[02:43.000 --> 03:01.000]  That they're creating a planetary crisis that by 2030, remember there's agenda 21, that's from 1992, the Rio de Janeiro, and then they have now codified the UN a couple years ago, agenda 2030.
[03:01.000 --> 03:16.000]  So this is a real globalist plan and they are carrying the plan out now humanity is fighting back.
[03:16.000 --> 03:30.000]  And many intelligence agencies and militaries around the world have gone and looked at these plans they've decompartmentalized and they realize that they are taking part in the post human system that's being built.
[03:30.000 --> 03:41.000]  Now, if you look at this, just as a scientist as or as a geopolitical strategist, what's being done doesn't make sense for humanity.
[03:41.000 --> 03:45.000]  And is it something that even psychotics would come up with.
[03:45.000 --> 03:51.000]  And that's why I've said that it appears to be an off world manipulation.
[03:51.000 --> 04:00.000]  And a lot of these technologies just appeared out of nowhere, by the way, and are way more advanced than anybody even knew. And there's jumps in them.
[04:00.000 --> 04:07.000]  There's major jumps going on inside the compartmentalization of government. I'm not a UFO guy. I don't get into all that.
[04:07.000 --> 04:35.000]  The globalist, though, are into it. And Silicon Valley and all these guys are signed on to some really hardcore stuff that was popularized by British intelligence and others who were working with Alistair Crowley, Jack Parsons, the Jet Propulsion Laboratory and others who were a big pack of hardcore black magicians who believe they were conjuring entities that were giving them this advice.
[04:35.000 --> 04:44.000]  And Alistair Crowley wrote about it before they were put in Hollywood movies for Hollywood Existed, little three foot gray alien at the pyramid, coming out and telling him what to do in a black magic ritual.
[04:44.000 --> 04:48.000]  So that's where you get the little gray aliens and the black guys and all that. That's a demon.
[04:48.000 --> 04:56.000]  So they can call this crazy all day. This is their real plan. They plan to kill every one of us. They're coming to kill everybody. Stay with us.
[04:56.000 --> 05:16.000]  The globalist, the eugenicist are always talking down to us. They're always trying to make us feel small to feel insignificant. They try to censor because they fear you and don't want you to have the right to access information so you can make your own decisions.
[05:16.000 --> 05:28.000]  They want you to believe you're powerless. But the truth is, it is we the people and our ideas and our actions and what we say and what we do that changes the world.
[05:28.000 --> 05:43.000]  We are the power structure. We are the inventors. We are the trailblazers. And the globalists understand that and they understand that they are basically trying to control and steal the future from we the people.
[05:43.000 --> 06:00.000]  Now, to help fund our operation that is undoubtedly the very tip of the spear against these globalists, I want to encourage listeners and viewers to understand that throughout the second half of the month of March, we're going to have store-wide free shipping and 50% off at m4store.com, something everybody should take advantage of.
[06:14.000 --> 06:27.000]  It is a choice, just like what I said, slavery is a choice. Einstein says the depth of insanity is doing the same thing, expecting a different result. So we keep on saying, I hate you, I hate you, f**k you, f**k you. How are we going to get a different result out of hate?
[06:27.000 --> 06:39.000]  Why don't we just try love? Why don't we just try love? We have the resources for a peaceful world. You know, sometimes you need some crazy motherf**kers to change something.
[06:39.000 --> 06:51.000]  Steve Jobs is crazy. Now we all know Steve Jobs phones. They say Trump's crazy. They say I'm crazy. But I'm here to show love. It's a bigger plan and I'm just doing what the universe told me.
[06:52.000 --> 06:58.000]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God. It's Alex Jones.
[06:58.000 --> 07:18.000]  Kanye's is doing what the universe told him to do. See, there's not just good in the universe. There's evil. And some people are doing what the dark side is telling them.
[07:18.000 --> 07:31.000]  Some people are being given very twisted, evil ideas by entities sworn to destroy all human life on this planet.
[07:31.000 --> 07:39.000]  That's what all the ancient cultures said. It's what the Bible says. It's what Judaism says. It's even what Islam says.
[07:39.000 --> 07:58.000]  But we just sit here and have an elite, so-called elite in Silicon Valley and the UN and everywhere, saying there are too many people who need a world government to forcibly reduce the population's numbers.
[07:58.000 --> 08:20.000]  And see, the Carnegie Endowment after World War I tried to get the League of Nations and it failed. So they said we need a bigger world war and then we need to break up the family and we need to emasculate the men and we need to basically end the human cycle as we know it because humans are warlike and bad.
[08:20.000 --> 08:32.000]  So we have to re-engineer humans to be submissive basically and who don't even breed anymore. And then we'll just phase out almost everybody because we're the super homo sapiens sapiens.
[08:32.000 --> 08:51.000]  Or the Ubermensch, the Superman. Yes, the comic book writers in the 1940s didn't come up with the Superman, the Ubermensch. It was the British.
[08:51.000 --> 09:06.000]  And it was the British scientists that came up with all of it, with scientists in the United States and some in Europe, Germany, Austria, Prussia, that particular state, most of it came out of that sector.
[09:06.000 --> 09:14.000]  If you look at the amount of things produced out of that Austrian-Hungarian empire, but I digress.
[09:14.000 --> 09:25.000]  And they said the way to have a final monopoly of control is to end the family. Tell the women it's cool to smoke cigarettes and drink liquor and to not have kids.
[09:25.000 --> 09:32.000]  Or if they have kids, put them in a government facility during the day, should we have pull control of them so we can program the kids, not mom and dad.
[09:32.000 --> 09:38.000]  And then sell women on how super cool it is. And all that's declassified, all that's public.
[09:38.000 --> 09:52.000]  And so once they've done that, this is a fact, they could really start dumbing people down and really start destroying people's roots and really start then preparing to decrease the world's population.
[09:52.000 --> 09:58.000]  But first you want to flood the first world with a giant bloom of the third world to bring the first world down.
[09:58.000 --> 10:10.000]  Then you release a bioweapon that culls large amounts of the population. And you tell them that it's a naturally occurring weapon or that terrorists released it.
[10:10.000 --> 10:16.000]  And then everybody's going to go into these highly controlled compact police state grid cities for their, quote, safety.
[10:16.000 --> 10:21.000]  And then that allows, over time, the social engineering to get even more draconian.
[10:21.000 --> 10:32.000]  And then basically they'll release bioweapons so deadly that only becoming basically artificial humans will allow you to live in the new environment that they are creating.
[10:32.000 --> 10:41.000]  So this is their real plan. A lot of you that read 50, 60, 70s, 80s sci-fi, you're like, I've read about a lot of this kind of stuff.
[10:41.000 --> 10:55.000]  But you notice it all came true. And that's because through the different world science fiction organizations, and by the way, H.D. Wells wrote more nonfiction books than he wrote fiction.
[10:55.000 --> 11:06.000]  He wrote all about this, things to come, how the British royal commissions created plans that they wanted to see carried out.
[11:06.000 --> 11:13.000]  But then they would popularize them into culture so that at a subconscious level we would just expect that to then happen in the future.
[11:13.000 --> 11:29.000]  And that's why in 1932, Brave New World was published by Aldous Huxley, whose brother would go on to create the UN and then run it.
[11:29.000 --> 11:32.000]  And they set up the entire program.
[11:32.000 --> 11:37.000]  That's why you read Brave New World, you're like, first they break up the family.
[11:37.000 --> 11:47.000]  30 years later, they start putting people on chemicals so that they can't give birth so they can, quote, change their sex.
[11:47.000 --> 11:55.000]  It's all done at first, it's fashion. You're roped in, it's cool, it's the fun thing to do.
[11:55.000 --> 12:05.000]  And then 100 years later, there's sub-boys that are two feet tall running around that are basically serving the system like bots.
[12:05.000 --> 12:13.000]  And then you've got the genetically superior establishment that lives forever up on the Elysium Hill.
[12:13.000 --> 12:24.000]  So it's a repeat of everything that Plato, 2,300 years before, envisioned as a master plan.
[12:24.000 --> 12:31.000]  And Plato knew that what humans can envision, humans can create because we're making the image of God.
[12:31.000 --> 12:38.000]  God really makes stuff, creates things, does things.
[12:38.000 --> 12:49.000]  The general public is in Plato's cave, even envisioned television and how it would be used to enslave and control.
[12:49.000 --> 12:57.000]  Now he wanted something better than just projecting stick figures on a cave wall and mesmerizing the public with theater,
[12:57.000 --> 13:03.000]  but how that it could be made even more real, they could create false realities to induce the public into
[13:03.000 --> 13:09.000]  so they would never know they were being exterminated and trained not to breed
[13:09.000 --> 13:20.000]  so the elite would remove the cancer of humanity from the breast of Mother Earth 2,300 years ago.
[13:20.000 --> 13:26.000]  By the way, everything Plato wrote about almost all of it, they've dug up or found now.
[13:26.000 --> 13:31.000]  Just like the Bible, they keep digging up cities and finding tombs and proving all of it.
[13:31.000 --> 13:40.000]  But there's one part he wrote about that they never found and that was Atlantis in the Atlantic Ocean, an island that had flying machines
[13:40.000 --> 13:45.000]  and an energy source that glowed white light that was its power but that exploded.
[13:45.000 --> 13:51.000]  And then for years it was freezing cold and the sky was dark because of all the dust in the air.
[13:51.000 --> 13:54.000]  How would someone know what really happens like that?
[13:54.000 --> 14:03.000]  I think you knew a little bit more, don't you think? Old Plato might have been talking to somebody
[14:03.000 --> 14:10.000]  that keeps little horns and little teeth hidden so you don't get scared.
[14:10.000 --> 14:16.000]  And so you see that's what this all comes down to and everybody knows the devil's real
[14:16.000 --> 14:20.000]  and the globalists have made a deal with the devil, period.
[14:20.000 --> 14:29.000]  And these entities, these demons and their leader have done this before.
[14:29.000 --> 14:37.000]  So Christ said, I have many flocks and so if they're allowed to get away with this, this is what's going to happen.
[14:37.000 --> 14:42.000]  Now when we come back, I'm going to get into, I'm going to get out of the esoteric and the hidden and the occult
[14:42.000 --> 14:46.000]  and what the globalists actually believe into, what they're doing.
[14:46.000 --> 14:52.000]  And the organized planetary collapse that they are carrying out against humanity right now
[14:52.000 --> 14:57.000]  that is going to be irreversible within six months to a year from my analysis.
[14:57.000 --> 15:04.000]  Now there's a lot of groups and organizations finally realizing how dire the straits are and moving against this.
[15:04.000 --> 15:11.000]  But people need to know in case they're successful who did it and who engineered it.
[15:11.000 --> 15:16.000]  So I'm going to lay all of that out when we return for several segments.
[15:16.000 --> 15:18.000]  Then I'll get into all the latest news and incredible clips.
[15:18.000 --> 15:25.000]  There's so much over the top news at infowars.com and prisonplanet.com that is absolutely beyond essential
[15:25.000 --> 15:28.000]  that everyone must see and that everyone must share.
[15:28.000 --> 15:33.000]  And it's not going to get moved down the field unless you do it.
[15:33.000 --> 15:36.000]  So I'm asking you to go to infowars.com.
[15:36.000 --> 15:41.000]  There's videos at the top, scroll down all the different articles, look throughout the entire site.
[15:41.000 --> 15:42.000]  Go to newswars.com.
[15:42.000 --> 15:44.000]  It's not a censored, it's infowars.com.
[15:44.000 --> 15:48.000]  So when you share it on Twitter and Facebook and places, they don't immediately, you know, block it
[15:48.000 --> 15:50.000]  and then you don't get slapped on the rest or banned.
[15:50.000 --> 15:52.000]  So newswars.com.

[17:25.000 --> 17:35.000]  The United States of Empire is a book that claims the United States is the empire of the world.
[17:35.000 --> 17:38.000]  George Washington had warned us against foreign wars.
[17:38.000 --> 17:44.000]  The United States of Empire shows that World Wars I and II left England broken.
[17:44.000 --> 17:48.000]  Its former colony, the U.S., had to save the empire.
[17:48.000 --> 17:50.000]  Was there ever a vote? Who do we fight for?
[17:50.000 --> 17:53.000]  The deep state began with World War I.
[17:53.000 --> 17:59.000]  The United States of Empire by James Dunn, available at Amazon Books.
[18:23.000 --> 18:27.000]  They experienced less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses.
[18:27.000 --> 18:31.000]  They began studying this effect in published trials, and decades later,
[18:31.000 --> 18:35.000]  we now have the fruit of this research, a fast-acting, chewable tablet
[18:35.000 --> 18:38.000]  that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms.
[18:38.000 --> 18:42.000]  Pollen block is natural and effective. It is not an antihistamine.
[18:42.000 --> 18:47.000]  In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of triptase,
[18:47.000 --> 18:52.000]  which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.
[18:52.000 --> 18:55.000]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe.
[18:55.000 --> 19:00.000]  Head to InfowarsLife.com and grab a pack of our pollen block chewable tablets.
[19:00.000 --> 19:04.000]  It's really hard to have the energy at the end of the day to still get to the gym
[19:04.000 --> 19:08.000]  or to go for a run or go to the park or heck, even take your dog for a walk.
[19:08.000 --> 19:11.000]  Believe me, I know. I spend hours in front of a screen
[19:11.000 --> 19:14.000]  and then hours in front of bright lights every day.
[19:14.000 --> 19:20.000]  But thanks to Supermail Vitality at InfowarsStore.com, I still have that energy.
[19:20.000 --> 19:23.000]  There's no way I could have the energy at the end of a long day
[19:23.000 --> 19:26.000]  to fight back against the chemicals and the food and water,
[19:26.000 --> 19:30.000]  to fight back against the modern-day lifestyle with the screen time and the extended hours,
[19:30.000 --> 19:34.000]  to still have the stamina and endurance, energy, and drive,
[19:34.000 --> 19:40.000]  to get to the gym, get to the park, and get exercise that you need for your health.
[19:40.000 --> 19:44.000]  So go to InfowarsStore.com and get Supermail Vitality before it's gone.
[19:44.000 --> 19:48.000]  This is actually our last run of Supermail Vitality.
[19:48.000 --> 19:53.000]  So I want you to experience Supermail Vitality before it's too late.
[19:53.000 --> 19:55.000]  Unleash the Supermail in you.
[19:55.000 --> 20:20.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[20:25.000 --> 20:41.000]  So you, for whatever reason, have decided to go visit Infowars.com or NewsWars.com
[20:41.000 --> 20:47.000]  or your local radio station or TV station and turn on the forbidden broadcast.
[20:47.000 --> 20:54.000]  And so that's why I think it's really important that I just square up to you
[20:54.000 --> 21:02.000]  and shoot you straight about what's really going on and really unfolding in this world.
[21:02.000 --> 21:06.000]  And just be completely honest with everybody.
[21:06.000 --> 21:09.000]  Now, a lot of folks are going to say, well, what's this paradox?
[21:09.000 --> 21:12.000]  You're saying Trump's doing a lot of really good stuff.
[21:12.000 --> 21:13.000]  Nationalists are getting elected.
[21:13.000 --> 21:15.000]  Globalism is fatally flawed.
[21:15.000 --> 21:18.000]  Even the globalists admit it's dead on arrival.
[21:18.000 --> 21:23.000]  But then you're saying we're six months to a year from a total planetary collapse.
[21:23.000 --> 21:26.000]  And a lot of what you said comes true, Jones.
[21:26.000 --> 21:29.000]  Why are you saying this?
[21:29.000 --> 21:33.000]  Well, I think you know better than I, especially if you've traveled the world.
[21:33.000 --> 21:37.000]  The planet is the most unstable it's ever been.
[21:37.000 --> 21:41.000]  The population is bigger than it's ever been.
[21:41.000 --> 21:45.000]  Corporations and governments are more ruthless than they've ever been.
[21:45.000 --> 21:55.000]  Africa is a hellhole everywhere now, including Libya and South Africa that were two relatively safe, good places.
[21:55.000 --> 21:58.000]  That were developing civilization.
[21:58.000 --> 22:03.000]  Those have been purposely brought down.
[22:03.000 --> 22:08.000]  The Middle East is doubling its population every 20 years.
[22:08.000 --> 22:17.000]  It'll be 3 billion in 2030, they're 1.8 billion right now, and they're radicalized.
[22:17.000 --> 22:23.000]  And they believe they have a right.
[22:23.000 --> 22:32.000]  The Muslims believe they have a right to rule, and they've been brought in by the West to dynamite the borders with Europe
[22:32.000 --> 22:38.000]  and to cause a total societal implosion.
[22:38.000 --> 22:43.000]  And then you've got the Latin American population that's doubled the last 30 years, set to double again.
[22:43.000 --> 22:51.000]  And they're all being taught by westernized media, corporate media, western media that goes into their countries to tell them America sucks.
[22:51.000 --> 22:56.000]  White people are all evil, and you'll get everything free in America.
[22:56.000 --> 22:57.000]  I mean, just add all that together.
[22:57.000 --> 22:58.000]  So what am I getting at here?
[22:58.000 --> 23:01.000]  I can go on for hours about the evidence of the collapse.
[23:01.000 --> 23:06.000]  The big key, the key, is this is being engineered?
[23:06.000 --> 23:11.000]  The globalists admit they're engineering it, and it can be stopped.
[23:11.000 --> 23:18.000]  So when you see AOC and Beto O'Rourke and the UN and all of them saying there'll be no human life in 12 years,
[23:18.000 --> 23:24.000]  and you sit back and you go, that's crazy, they're being given that talking point.
[23:24.000 --> 23:26.000]  They're just meat puppets.
[23:26.000 --> 23:28.000]  But that's what schoolchildren are being taught.
[23:28.000 --> 23:39.000]  So we all laugh at it, but it's not a laughing matter.
[23:39.000 --> 23:45.000]  So this is a plan, and they're implanting in our minds to prepare and accept societal collapse,
[23:45.000 --> 23:49.000]  to give up on our life force, to give up on trying to be good change agents in the world,
[23:49.000 --> 23:55.000]  to stop this and make the world better, to give up on ourselves, our children, on civilization,
[23:55.000 --> 24:02.000]  to demoralize us, show the psychic compulsion has been put in our minds to hate ourselves
[24:02.000 --> 24:09.000]  and to believe we're a cancer, and it's a self-fulfilling prophecy when the whole system goes down.
[24:09.000 --> 24:17.000]  And folks, a world system with 7.5 billion people going down will make Road Warrior look like a tea party.
[24:17.000 --> 24:21.000]  It'll be nuclear reactors melting down, exploding, going out.
[24:21.000 --> 24:24.000]  It'll be giant, uncontrolled forest fires.
[24:24.000 --> 24:31.000]  It'll be everything you see compacted and worse and roving hordes of people running around,
[24:31.000 --> 24:34.000]  engaging in societal and then literal cannibalism.
[24:34.000 --> 24:38.000]  And that's why I have all the zombie movies and all the shows getting you ready.
[24:38.000 --> 24:41.000]  The Road, Viggo Mortensen. Viggo's a good guy.
[24:41.000 --> 24:45.000]  The Rockefeller Foundation got that book, promoted it, made the movie.
[24:45.000 --> 24:48.000]  Look it up. Read the books even worse.
[24:48.000 --> 24:55.000]  Baby's getting cooked on spits, but that really happens in the real world within about 15 days of no food and water.
[24:55.000 --> 24:59.000]  People string kids up, they eat them.
[24:59.000 --> 25:03.000]  So, the veneer of civilization's almost gone.
[25:03.000 --> 25:09.000]  The purposeful takedown of the planet right as we prepare to go to jump point,
[25:09.000 --> 25:12.000]  not just to the stars, but to other dimensions.
[25:12.000 --> 25:17.000]  The establishments obsessed with the technology they've got, they're obsessed with the breakaway civilization,
[25:17.000 --> 25:20.000]  but they've got life extension, they've already got everything.
[25:20.000 --> 25:24.000]  For all intents and purposes, they found forms of immortality.
[25:24.000 --> 25:29.000]  And they're able to push off-death so far they believe they'll have true immortality within 50 years.
[25:29.000 --> 25:34.000]  And so, we're just an afterthought.
[25:34.000 --> 25:38.000]  You see, globalism was always meant to fail.
[25:38.000 --> 25:44.000]  But for the acolytes, the sub-level, not the actual elite, but the sub-oids,
[25:44.000 --> 25:48.000]  the professors and the technicians, they believe they're taking over the earth to save the planet,
[25:48.000 --> 25:50.000]  and it's their right to rule and organize society.
[25:50.000 --> 25:52.000]  That's why they're going to reduce population.
[25:52.000 --> 25:55.000]  If you're just a kind of a mid-level person, you're told 80%.
[25:55.000 --> 25:57.000]  If you're higher level, you're told 90%.
[25:57.000 --> 26:01.000]  If you're really high level, you're told 99% of humans will be taken out.
[26:01.000 --> 26:06.000]  And if you're in that maybe 2,000 people that have been given the whole ball of wax, the whole picture,
[26:06.000 --> 26:09.000]  you're told humans are an abomination.
[26:09.000 --> 26:16.000]  And our God says he will give us the codes to merge with silicon and truly live forever with him
[26:16.000 --> 26:21.000]  and be uploaded to the consciousness and then move on to the next planet.
[26:21.000 --> 26:25.000]  You're like, wait a minute, I read an Arthur C. Clarke book called Childhoods In
[26:25.000 --> 26:29.000]  that the whole media pushed and loved and it was so good and so wonderful.
[26:29.000 --> 26:33.000]  Arthur C. Clarke was in the real Illuminati.
[26:33.000 --> 26:38.000]  He was in the real Crowley-type groups that they just used Crowley to put out some of their info.
[26:38.000 --> 26:40.000]  Crowley didn't come up with any of it.
[26:40.000 --> 26:45.000]  He was in MI6, OSS before that, total highest level.
[26:45.000 --> 26:50.000]  So see, you read those books, you watch those movies and let me explain something to you.
[26:50.000 --> 26:53.000]  They're telling you how the cow ate the cabbage.
[26:53.000 --> 26:56.000]  You understand?
[26:56.000 --> 27:03.000]  They're telling you how the cow ate the cabbage.
[27:03.000 --> 27:08.000]  Who came up with enigma code machines that could break German codes, the British?
[27:08.000 --> 27:13.000]  Who came up with all the spy grids and all the systems we know about, the British?
[27:13.000 --> 27:16.000]  Who came up with everything?
[27:16.000 --> 27:20.000]  And they make the joke, why can't they design an automobile that works?
[27:20.000 --> 27:23.000]  Doesn't break down because they're not interested in automobiles.
[27:23.000 --> 27:24.000]  It's all mind war.
[27:24.000 --> 27:29.000]  The British created Hitler, set him up, had a treaty with him to set up the European Union.
[27:29.000 --> 27:35.000]  They even had the king ready to sit on the throne of Europe, betrayed the Germans, set him up.
[27:35.000 --> 27:40.000]  And yeah, the Nazis were evil, but who's really bad?
[27:40.000 --> 27:44.000]  You see, you've got to think multi-steps here to understand this show.
[27:44.000 --> 27:55.000]  Our country and the world is being purposely collapsed from the family level to the cellular level,
[27:55.000 --> 28:01.000]  to the neighborhood level, to the town, county, state, federal, international.
[28:01.000 --> 28:06.000]  Everything is about sucking out energy, sucking out hope, sucking out resources,
[28:06.000 --> 28:11.000]  dumbing people down, killing human exploration of space,
[28:11.000 --> 28:14.000]  teaching everyone that it's all a simulation and none of it matters.
[28:14.000 --> 28:17.000]  So you give up hope so you have no destiny.
[28:17.000 --> 28:23.000]  Now you can say this is some psychotic group that just has these visions
[28:23.000 --> 28:29.000]  and have created these entities in their minds as an alter ego that they communicate with
[28:29.000 --> 28:34.000]  in their giant psychosis to carry out these operations against us.
[28:34.000 --> 28:40.000]  But one way or the other, the heads of the major intelligence agencies and all these other groups
[28:40.000 --> 28:46.000]  believe they're following the orders of a eternal being that they believe is God.
[28:46.000 --> 28:51.000]  Now there are more and more groups that are saying we don't want to go with that God and kill everybody.
[28:51.000 --> 28:56.000]  That's good. Let's go with Jesus. That's the real God, not Lucifer,
[28:56.000 --> 28:59.000]  not the devil that Arthur C. Clarke would tell you was good.
[28:59.000 --> 29:03.000]  Ew, get the stinky dog away from me. Bad breath and bad gas.
[29:03.000 --> 29:06.000]  PDE stopped eating. All of his hair fell out.
[29:06.000 --> 29:08.000]  Itching, licking, missing fur.
[29:08.000 --> 29:10.000]  At least $5,000 in that bill.
[29:10.000 --> 29:12.000]  Crames, antibiotics, sprays.
[29:12.000 --> 29:13.000]  No results.
[29:13.000 --> 29:16.000]  Everything we tried failed except the Dynabyte.
[29:16.000 --> 29:18.000]  D-I-N-O-V-I-T-E.com.
[29:18.000 --> 29:21.000]  If you want the dog to be healthy, you've got to feed this hungry healthy.
[29:21.000 --> 29:23.000]  The omega-3 fatty acids.
[29:23.000 --> 29:29.000]  Black seed, zinc, alfalfa, the digestive enzymes that are cooked out of regular dog food.
[29:29.000 --> 29:31.000]  Dynabyte is nutrition.
[29:31.000 --> 29:33.000]  The shedding is stopped and the itching is stopped.
[29:33.000 --> 29:38.000]  Her coat is not soft. It's silky. It's healthy and shiny and glossy.
[29:38.000 --> 29:40.000]  She's got life. She's got energy.
[29:40.000 --> 29:42.000]  Tons of energy. No more bad smells.
[29:42.000 --> 29:43.000]  Dynabyte's the mom.
[29:43.000 --> 29:48.000]  Dynabyte is the best thing that's ever happened to my dogs. You know, besides me, of course.
[29:48.000 --> 29:51.000]  8-5-9-4-2-8-1-thousand.
[29:51.000 --> 29:54.000]  8-5-9-4-2-8-1-thousand.
[29:54.000 --> 29:55.000]  Dynabyte for life.
[29:55.000 --> 30:17.000]  Dyno-V-I-T-E.com.

[31:00.000 --> 31:03.000]  Frank in North Carolina, thanks for holding so long. Go ahead.
[31:03.000 --> 31:08.000]  I just have to say something, man. It seems like every time I turn on your broadcast, you're
[31:08.000 --> 31:10.000]  bragging. It just gets old, man.
[31:10.000 --> 31:13.000]  I'm going to shut you down right now, okay?
[31:13.000 --> 31:17.000]  We're taking calls about your nomination. Do you understand they're having congressional
[31:17.000 --> 31:22.000]  hearings trying to shut us down? Do you understand I'm ringing the alarm?
[31:22.000 --> 31:25.000]  If that was happening to anybody else, I'd be freaked out.
[31:25.000 --> 31:29.000]  I mean, what's it going to take us being shut down? Is that what you want, Frank?
[31:29.000 --> 31:30.000]  You know what, Alex?
[31:30.000 --> 31:35.000]  Hey, put him on pause again. Hey, Frank, do you understand it's not bragging to say we
[31:35.000 --> 31:38.000]  are the tip of the spear, we're under attack, we need your help.
[31:38.000 --> 31:42.000]  As much begging as I do, we can barely pay the bills and grow in the face of this.
[31:42.000 --> 31:45.000]  I'm not going to just stop growth and let them start pushing us backwards.
[31:45.000 --> 31:49.000]  You understand? I need your help, Frank. I need your help, Frank.
[31:49.000 --> 31:55.000]  Go to InfowarsStore.com right now and help fund the Infowars.
[31:55.000 --> 32:00.000]  Do you understand? I need your help, Frank. Free press needs your help, Frank.
[32:00.000 --> 32:04.000]  InfowarsStore.com is how you support us and it's not like we're selling stuff you don't
[32:04.000 --> 32:10.000]  need, you don't want. The air in the average American home is filled with toxins that put
[32:10.000 --> 32:13.000]  it on par with a major city.
[32:13.000 --> 32:18.000]  Some of the most polluted areas on earth are major cities. How can I solve that problem?
[32:18.000 --> 32:24.000]  So we have air filters at InfowarsStore.com, the Alexa Pure Breeze, which is right now
[32:24.000 --> 32:32.000]  $50 off the Alexa Pure Breeze groundbreaking iron cluster air filter technology.
[32:32.000 --> 32:35.000]  And we've got a limited quantity of these left right now.
[32:35.000 --> 32:39.000]  We're basically selling these at cost because there was a big overhaul.
[32:39.000 --> 32:43.000]  Go ahead and read the hundreds of five-star reviews for yourself.
[32:43.000 --> 32:48.000]  I've got two in my home. You will notice the difference, ladies and gentlemen,
[32:48.000 --> 32:51.000]  with the Alexa Pure Breeze in your house.
[32:51.000 --> 32:57.000]  Don't live in a polluted major city in your home. Have clean air.
[32:57.000 --> 33:17.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[33:17.000 --> 33:41.000]  The answer to 1984 is 1776. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[33:41.000 --> 33:48.000]  Along this current trajectory, there will be people who can no longer live in the cities that they call home today.
[33:48.000 --> 33:53.000]  There is food grown in this country that will no longer prosper in these soils.
[33:53.000 --> 33:57.000]  There is going to be massive migration of tens or hundreds of millions of people
[33:57.000 --> 34:02.000]  from countries that are literally uninhabitable or underwater that are above the sea right now.
[34:02.000 --> 34:08.000]  This is our final chance. The scientists are absolutely unanimous on this,
[34:08.000 --> 34:14.000]  that we have no more than 12 years to take incredibly bold action on this crisis.
[34:14.000 --> 34:17.000]  The crisis that could, at its worst, lead to extinction.
[34:17.000 --> 34:26.000]  I think that the part of it that is generational is that millennials and people and Gen Z
[34:26.000 --> 34:30.000]  and all these folks that come after us are looking up and we're like,
[34:30.000 --> 34:34.000]  the world is going to end in 12 years if we don't address climate change.
[34:34.000 --> 34:43.000]  And your biggest issue is how are we going to pay for it?
[34:43.000 --> 34:47.000]  And this is the war. This is our world war too.
[34:47.000 --> 34:53.000]  That's right. It's your world war against humanity saying we're bad, we're killing the earth,
[34:53.000 --> 34:57.000]  while the globalists are creating all the terminator seeds, all the genetic engineering,
[34:57.000 --> 35:02.000]  all the human animal hybrids, all the toxic waste, all the thousands of nuclear weapons
[35:02.000 --> 35:05.000]  that they detonated in the upper atmosphere trying to ignite it.
[35:05.000 --> 35:09.000]  That's even on History Channel. They tried to burn up the atmosphere the globalists did.
[35:09.000 --> 35:12.000]  But their God wasn't powerful enough to do it yet.
[35:12.000 --> 35:16.000]  So they're trying to bring down the pillars of earth and destroy the planet.
[35:16.000 --> 35:20.000]  And they tell us they want to shave it, put them in charge, pay Lord Rothschild,
[35:20.000 --> 35:24.000]  pay the Rockefellers, pay the Chicago Mercantile Exchange in Obama,
[35:24.000 --> 35:30.000]  and Al Gore that owns part of it, billions of dollars a day to drive your car,
[35:30.000 --> 35:35.000]  live your life, and everything you do is then surveilled.
[35:35.000 --> 35:44.000]  See, first it was Al Gore saying in 2003 that by 2017 that all the major cities would be underwater.
[35:44.000 --> 35:50.000]  See, levels are the exact same height. Some measurements are half inch higher, half inch lower.
[35:50.000 --> 35:56.000]  San Francisco actually has, last time I checked a few years ago, lower tides than they did in the 1850s.
[35:56.000 --> 36:01.000]  But it doesn't matter. You're bad and she's going to save you.
[36:01.000 --> 36:04.000]  In fact, there's a clip. I forgot to give it to you guys.
[36:04.000 --> 36:09.000]  It was in a Jonathan Till love fawning article he did for the statesman.
[36:09.000 --> 36:12.000]  But he did shoot a bunch of videos himself on his iPhone that are pretty good.
[36:12.000 --> 36:17.000]  I meant to give it to you. And Beethoven was like, we're the only hope of the earth.
[36:17.000 --> 36:22.000]  And spazzing his hands, we're called the white people don't know what it's like to be poor.
[36:22.000 --> 36:27.000]  Have you noticed how much he's got that weird, like Connecticut accent or something?
[36:27.000 --> 36:32.000]  I just can't stand it, man.
[36:32.000 --> 36:36.000]  His father-in-law, his whole family, they're a bunch of dirty carpet badgers, man.
[36:36.000 --> 36:42.000]  They come down here and they feed off Latinos and white people, black people.
[36:42.000 --> 36:46.000]  I mean, his whole family is just scum of the earth.
[36:46.000 --> 36:56.000]  Opportunistic Eddie Haskell meets Count Dracula, meets kind of a microwave to Kennedy.
[36:56.000 --> 37:05.000]  And then you've got the automaton who's there just like AOC, just total puppets that'll do whatever they're told.
[37:05.000 --> 37:08.000]  The earth is gone. We're all dead in 12 years.
[37:08.000 --> 37:12.000]  The globalists are purposely collapsing with third world.
[37:12.000 --> 37:14.000]  They're purposely opening our borders. They're advertising.
[37:14.000 --> 37:19.000]  They're going to come here to the poorest people so that as they collapse things, they say, see?
[37:19.000 --> 37:24.000]  See, its climate change is causing borders to collapse, not the UN funding it,
[37:24.000 --> 37:28.000]  not George Soros getting taxpayer money and sending people in.
[37:28.000 --> 37:30.000]  No.
[37:30.000 --> 37:38.000]  And so the communists, the socialists, the brainwashed SJWs of the Middle East and of Latin America
[37:38.000 --> 37:41.000]  and of Africa are put in refugee camps.
[37:41.000 --> 37:44.000]  In this country, that's internal. They go to the one that's on a port.
[37:44.000 --> 37:48.000]  The UN's there and they ship them by boat. They fly them by plane.
[37:48.000 --> 37:52.000]  They march their ass up and they just pour in.
[37:52.000 --> 37:54.000]  Everybody's freaking out over all this.
[37:54.000 --> 37:59.000]  These are the people that the UN wants the whole world to see borders gone.
[37:59.000 --> 38:02.000]  Only a third of the people coming in are actually marching in.
[38:02.000 --> 38:05.000]  They're flying in on airplanes.
[38:05.000 --> 38:08.000]  People say, oh, Trump shouldn't care about this.
[38:08.000 --> 38:13.000]  Only a third of who's coming in. Yeah, but he knows the visual is just like with Europe
[38:13.000 --> 38:17.000]  because it was less than a third, 10 years ago in Europe, we're walking in.
[38:17.000 --> 38:22.000]  But once it triggers the mega-collapse and once the collapse happens,
[38:22.000 --> 38:24.000]  can you imagine we don't have a border?
[38:24.000 --> 38:33.000]  And let's say a bio weapon gets released in Venezuela or Paraguay or somewhere,
[38:33.000 --> 38:40.000]  and the domino effect of hundreds of millions dying and rampaging forward
[38:40.000 --> 38:44.000]  and we don't have a border when we border hell.
[38:44.000 --> 38:48.000]  Oh, there's a lot of great people, a lot of great things down there, but it's hell now.
[38:48.000 --> 38:51.000]  It's unstable. It's dangerous. It's scary.
[38:51.000 --> 38:57.000]  And the establishment keeps people in poverty as a tool of economic domination and control.
[38:57.000 --> 39:04.000]  And so the people get tired of the lawlessness of the government
[39:04.000 --> 39:08.000]  and not letting them have prosperity. So they start taking guns in their hands
[39:08.000 --> 39:11.000]  and they start saying, I'm going to do what I want because this is a lawless system
[39:11.000 --> 39:19.000]  and the social contract is broken and then all hell is released.
[39:19.000 --> 39:26.000]  We have deviated from the plan that we know works that God gave us the Bible.
[39:26.000 --> 39:29.000]  You can have the exact same Africans in Rwanda.
[39:29.000 --> 39:32.000]  There's many other cases all over the world.
[39:32.000 --> 39:39.000]  You have the exact same people, same genetics, people all very similar genetics.
[39:39.000 --> 39:45.000]  And you'll have one tribe that's animist or Islamic or anything else
[39:45.000 --> 39:47.000]  and they just can't get to act together.
[39:47.000 --> 39:52.000]  And then you'll have a tribe that's Christian and they always produce on average
[39:52.000 --> 39:56.000]  20 times the prosperity of any other group.
[39:56.000 --> 40:03.000]  20 times, 20 times more productive Christians, 20.
[40:03.000 --> 40:06.000]  And I don't mean fake establishment, mega church Christians.
[40:06.000 --> 40:12.000]  I mean real Christians produce on average when they're right next door to heathen
[40:12.000 --> 40:16.000]  with the same genetics 20 times.
[40:16.000 --> 40:18.000]  Why is that?
[40:18.000 --> 40:21.000]  Because a Christian sees somebody else as them and as a real collectivist.
[40:21.000 --> 40:24.000]  Not a fake collectivist that lets some central government run everything
[40:24.000 --> 40:28.000]  and divvy up everything and then control and create command and control.
[40:28.000 --> 40:32.000]  A Christian is strong and hard working and bold and builds things
[40:32.000 --> 40:36.000]  and then sees others as themselves and tries to teach them how to fish,
[40:36.000 --> 40:39.000]  tries to build them up, tries to apprentice them
[40:39.000 --> 40:42.000]  and then doesn't feel bad when they're strong.
[40:42.000 --> 40:47.000]  A Christian sees someone that they help become more successful than them
[40:47.000 --> 40:52.000]  and they feel good because they have a connection.
[40:52.000 --> 40:55.000]  I am the ultimate collectivist.
[40:55.000 --> 40:59.000]  You will not find a bigger collectivist on this planet than Alex Jones.
[40:59.000 --> 41:03.000]  And that's why I'm a total individualist because each of us is a cell
[41:03.000 --> 41:05.000]  and I've got to be strong and not be cancerous
[41:05.000 --> 41:08.000]  and I've got to stand against the cancer and stand against the evil
[41:08.000 --> 41:13.000]  and be as strong as I can in what I do to try to lift up the entire system.
[41:13.000 --> 41:16.000]  That's what Christ does.
[41:16.000 --> 41:20.000]  So how does the devil fight something that's collectivist but individualistic
[41:20.000 --> 41:24.000]  and competitive and it builds everything and will warp us past the stars?
[41:24.000 --> 41:26.000]  Like that.
[41:26.000 --> 41:29.000]  I has not seen or has not heard what God has in store.
[41:29.000 --> 41:31.000]  Just seconds in history's time frame.
[41:31.000 --> 41:33.000]  We're just almost to the finish line.
[41:33.000 --> 41:34.000]  And the devil and all his minions are,
[41:34.000 --> 41:36.000]  No, you're not going to have it.
[41:36.000 --> 41:37.000]  You're not going to have it.
[41:37.000 --> 41:39.000]  You're not going to have life extension.
[41:39.000 --> 41:40.000]  You're not going to have all the dimensions.
[41:40.000 --> 41:42.000]  No, no, no, because they're all the failures.
[41:42.000 --> 41:44.000]  The interdimensional scum.
[41:44.000 --> 41:48.000]  The trash.
[41:48.000 --> 41:49.000]  The viruses.
[41:49.000 --> 41:53.000]  The program for us to kill ourselves.
[41:53.000 --> 41:55.000]  Like why in all the literature from every culture,
[41:55.000 --> 41:57.000]  demons want you just to hurt kids and burn down buildings
[41:57.000 --> 42:00.000]  and kill crops and have famine and starving people and death?
[42:00.000 --> 42:04.000]  Because it's a weapon.
[42:04.000 --> 42:09.000]  It's a weapon fired into our psyche to make us destroy ourselves.
[42:09.000 --> 42:11.000]  It's a torpedo.
[42:11.000 --> 42:15.000]  And we have to just say, no, we don't accept the torpedo.
[42:15.000 --> 42:20.000]  We don't accept the operating system of the crazed demoniac garbage.
[42:20.000 --> 42:25.000]  Anybody can tune into that crap.
[42:25.000 --> 42:27.000]  We need to tune out of it.
[42:27.000 --> 42:32.000]  Because the whole universe is like a giant spectrum radio transmission.
[42:32.000 --> 42:33.000]  You can dial in anything you want.
[42:33.000 --> 42:34.000]  If you have free will.
[42:34.000 --> 42:36.000]  How about you dial into God?
[42:36.000 --> 42:40.000]  They are trying to collapse the planet right now to take everybody out.
[42:40.000 --> 42:42.000]  We're nipping tucks here.
[42:42.000 --> 42:44.000]  Everybody's got to be more involved than ever.
[42:44.000 --> 42:47.000]  Praying, being involved, and standing against globalism,
[42:47.000 --> 42:49.000]  and the UN and open borders and their entire plan.
[42:49.000 --> 42:52.000]  Whatever they're pushing, it's death and destruction.
[42:52.000 --> 42:53.000]  All the proof's there.
[42:53.000 --> 42:59.000]  So oppose everything the UN and CNN says, and you'll do great.
[42:59.000 --> 43:03.000]  Living in volcano may sound more dramatic than it really is.
[43:03.000 --> 43:06.000]  The real drama can be found here in Leilani Estates.
[43:06.000 --> 43:09.000]  But a lot of us on the big island rely on rainwater.
[43:09.000 --> 43:12.000]  And we need to be concerned about ash and acid rain.
[43:12.000 --> 43:16.000]  Volcanic ash may contain heavy metal particles.
[43:16.000 --> 43:20.000]  And acid rain could lower the pH of the water to unhealthy levels.
[43:20.000 --> 43:26.000]  To find out, we employed a series of tests for heavy metals, alkalinity, and pH.
[43:26.000 --> 43:30.000]  What we learned was that there was in fact unhealthy levels of heavy metals
[43:30.000 --> 43:32.000]  and acidity in the rainwater.
[43:32.000 --> 43:36.000]  Next, we tested the water from our Alexa pure gravity filter.
[43:36.000 --> 43:40.000]  And not only were the heavy metal levels within safe measure,
[43:40.000 --> 43:43.000]  but the pH was also restored to optimal levels.
[43:43.000 --> 43:49.000]  As it turns out, the filter on the Alexa pure raises the pH of the water.
[43:49.000 --> 43:52.000]  So what we've learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain
[43:52.000 --> 43:54.000]  can contaminate a rainwater supply.
[43:54.000 --> 43:59.000]  But more importantly, a good water filtration system will purify it.
[43:59.000 --> 44:01.000]  Our grandparents, our great grandparents,
[44:01.000 --> 44:05.000]  knew that they canned food during the falls they'd have it during the winter.
[44:05.000 --> 44:08.000]  And that's what I'm talking about at M4Store.com.
[44:08.000 --> 44:12.000]  With M4 Select, it's the full spectrum of my patriots supply
[44:12.000 --> 44:15.000]  on the top most respected companies out there.
[44:15.000 --> 44:17.000]  But because I private label it,
[44:17.000 --> 44:20.000]  I'm able to go below cost on contracts
[44:20.000 --> 44:23.000]  that all their other distributors aren't able to do.
[44:23.000 --> 44:25.000]  But I want to be a market leader,
[44:25.000 --> 44:28.000]  and I want you to have storeable food so it's a total win-win.
[44:28.000 --> 44:32.000]  We have those incredible sell prices back at M4Store.com.
[44:32.000 --> 44:36.000]  On M4 Select, storeable foods, they've got special diet foods,
[44:36.000 --> 44:40.000]  they've got three-month supplies, your supplies, weak emergency supplies.
[44:40.000 --> 44:42.000]  They've got so many great products there.
[44:42.000 --> 44:44.000]  Maybe you've got a three-year supply.
[44:44.000 --> 44:46.000]  If stuff happens, you can feed your whole block.
[44:46.000 --> 44:48.000]  It's up to us to be self-sufficient.
[44:48.000 --> 44:51.000]  You're buying war bonds, bringing great products together.
[44:51.000 --> 44:53.000]  With God's help, we are unstoppable.
[44:53.000 --> 44:57.000]  M4Store.com and M4 Select high-quality storeable foods
[44:57.000 --> 45:00.000]  powered by my patriots supply.
[45:00.000 --> 45:02.000]  If you're not expanding, you're imploding.
[45:02.000 --> 45:04.000]  There is no set stasis.
[45:04.000 --> 45:07.000]  There is no managed system. There is no un-continuum.
[45:07.000 --> 45:10.000]  The continuum is always launching forward in the future.
[45:10.000 --> 45:13.000]  So you support us and get creative and get fired up.
[45:13.000 --> 45:15.000]  We won't just be here 100 years, we'll be here forever.
[45:15.000 --> 45:17.000]  We'll turn the whole thing around.
[45:17.000 --> 45:20.000]  Our grandchildren on Mars bases and jump bases,
[45:20.000 --> 45:22.000]  and God knows what, are going to look back and say,
[45:22.000 --> 45:24.000]  we struggled here, we made it.
[45:24.000 --> 45:26.000]  And that's really where this goes.
[45:26.000 --> 45:28.000]  God's got a big war for you ready.
[45:28.000 --> 45:31.000]  And so if you can't face George Soros and Hillary Clinton
[45:31.000 --> 45:33.000]  and Adolf Hitler and Mao Zedong,
[45:33.000 --> 45:35.000]  are you going to really be able to face the other stuff?
[45:35.000 --> 45:39.000]  Because God wants warriors that are smart and are ready to build things
[45:39.000 --> 45:40.000]  and are also ready to fight.
[45:40.000 --> 45:43.000]  You don't go to the next level without getting a big weight put on your back.
[45:43.000 --> 45:45.000]  And I mean, I don't know what's going to happen to me in the future.
[45:45.000 --> 45:49.000]  I mean, all I know is, I want to go with the master built.
[45:49.000 --> 45:50.000]  I want to go to the next level.
[45:50.000 --> 45:53.000]  I want to be with the spirit that I've experienced,
[45:53.000 --> 45:55.000]  not these devil worshipers.
[45:55.000 --> 45:57.000]  They're cold and failed and feels like being a tomb.
[45:57.000 --> 46:00.000]  I want life. I want Jesus.
[46:00.000 --> 46:03.000]  There are thousands of ideologies out there.
[46:03.000 --> 46:05.000]  Hundreds of different political systems.
[46:05.000 --> 46:07.000]  And most of them are funded by the globalist.
[46:07.000 --> 46:11.000]  Infowars is truly the tip of the spear of the zeitgeist.
[46:11.000 --> 46:13.000]  That's why the globalists are obsessed with it,
[46:13.000 --> 46:14.000]  trying to shut it down.
[46:14.000 --> 46:16.000]  I didn't invent all this.
[46:16.000 --> 46:18.000]  I went and researched the Renaissance,
[46:18.000 --> 46:20.000]  Americana and what really works for humanity.
[46:20.000 --> 46:22.000]  And I'm simply trying to bring it back.
[46:22.000 --> 46:26.000]  And lo and behold, it's super popular like it's always been.
[46:26.000 --> 46:30.000]  That's why the globalists are trying to shut it down so desperately,
[46:30.000 --> 46:33.000]  because we have the light in the dark of the night
[46:33.000 --> 46:35.000]  that sends chills up my spine.
[46:35.000 --> 46:38.000]  So whatever you do, continue to support yourself and Infowars
[46:38.000 --> 46:40.000]  by buying the great products at infowarsstore.com,
[46:40.000 --> 46:42.000]  by spreading the articles, by spreading the videos,
[46:42.000 --> 46:44.000]  and by praying for this operation
[46:44.000 --> 46:46.000]  and for praying for this nation and the world
[46:46.000 --> 46:48.000]  for peace and discernment.
[46:48.000 --> 46:50.000]  For myself and the whole Infowars family,
[46:50.000 --> 46:52.000]  I want to thank all of you for what you've done,
[46:52.000 --> 46:55.000]  because without you, Infowars is nothing.
[46:55.000 --> 46:58.000]  You are the Infowar, and I salute you.
[47:25.000 --> 47:27.000]  You are the Infowar, and I salute you.
[47:56.000 --> 48:01.000]  This broadcast is all about love.
[48:01.000 --> 48:04.000]  You know, I'm going to get into this later with Barnes.
[48:04.000 --> 48:06.000]  He's really a smart cookie in studio.
[48:06.000 --> 48:09.000]  We're going to have a whole bunch of issues with us next hour.
[48:09.000 --> 48:14.000]  But it's just crazy how in this whole Sandy Hook thing,
[48:14.000 --> 48:17.000]  these Democrat lawyers run by Senator Blumenthal,
[48:17.000 --> 48:19.000]  runs the whole thing, runs the law firm,
[48:19.000 --> 48:22.000]  sitting with me, everything, they literally keep going.
[48:22.000 --> 48:25.000]  They give us the marketing plans and how you made money
[48:25.000 --> 48:26.000]  off Sandy Hook.
[48:26.000 --> 48:28.000]  And I'm like, you're the ones that made that up.
[48:28.000 --> 48:30.000]  I hardly ever talked about it.
[48:30.000 --> 48:32.000]  I'm sick of it.
[48:32.000 --> 48:34.000]  And they're like, well, where are the emails?
[48:34.000 --> 48:36.000]  Hey, you know media matters.
[48:36.000 --> 48:38.000]  Spying on me for over a decade knows.
[48:38.000 --> 48:40.000]  Have I ever given an email out on there?
[48:40.000 --> 48:43.000]  I got rid of Alex Jones or Alex in Infowars
[48:43.000 --> 48:46.000]  like 12 years ago, because I was getting
[48:46.000 --> 48:51.000]  10,000 emails a day, and it was crashing the servers.
[48:51.000 --> 48:55.000]  And so now I have been literally with three different law firms,
[48:55.000 --> 49:01.000]  not believing me, tearing everything out of the walls
[49:01.000 --> 49:05.000]  to find this imaginary stuff.
[49:05.000 --> 49:06.000]  I was like, what?
[49:06.000 --> 49:09.000]  But they say your whole life is Sandy Hook.
[49:09.000 --> 49:11.000]  And any listener knows it's not.
[49:11.000 --> 49:15.000]  Well, I might talk about it once every three months or something
[49:15.000 --> 49:19.000]  when a caller brings it up until Megyn Kelly made it my identity
[49:19.000 --> 49:22.000]  and came down here and all that crap.
[49:22.000 --> 49:26.000]  And the thing is, then I start talking to the people,
[49:26.000 --> 49:28.000]  and they're like, yeah, they say the mergers run you
[49:28.000 --> 49:31.000]  and the Russians, and there's all these secret things.
[49:31.000 --> 49:33.000]  You don't really sell supplements or t-shirts or anything.
[49:33.000 --> 49:36.000]  And I'm like, well, that's not true.
[49:36.000 --> 49:37.000]  It's OK.
[49:37.000 --> 49:39.000]  I won't tell anybody.
[49:39.000 --> 49:40.000]  And I'm like, you know what?
[49:40.000 --> 49:41.000]  I get it.
[49:41.000 --> 49:43.000]  None of you people are self-made.
[49:43.000 --> 49:44.000]  Not some of my audience.
[49:44.000 --> 49:45.000]  You've made Infowars.
[49:45.000 --> 49:49.000]  These lawyers and the politicians and these people,
[49:49.000 --> 49:56.000]  they actually believe that there is some magic group funding us
[49:56.000 --> 50:00.000]  because they are all controlled.
[50:00.000 --> 50:05.000]  And they wouldn't know the light if it appeared right in front of them.
[50:05.000 --> 50:07.000]  It's the craziest damn thing I've ever seen.
[50:07.000 --> 50:11.000]  I just want to say thank God.
[50:11.000 --> 50:14.000]  I don't live anywhere around these so-called elites.
[50:14.000 --> 50:17.000]  I mean, I get the Willys in DC.
[50:17.000 --> 50:18.000]  New York's a little different.
[50:18.000 --> 50:19.000]  There's so many regular people.
[50:19.000 --> 50:20.000]  I kind of like New York.
[50:20.000 --> 50:22.000]  But you get around the elitist, then I get the Willys.
[50:22.000 --> 50:25.000]  LA, I just, it's like torture to go there.
[50:25.000 --> 50:27.000]  I mean, I'm not afraid of a lot of stuff
[50:27.000 --> 50:28.000]  or get depressed by anything.
[50:28.000 --> 50:33.000]  But I get upset when I've got to go to Los Angeles.
[50:33.000 --> 50:36.000]  I'm going to be there next week because it's empty.
[50:36.000 --> 50:37.000]  It's the spirit.
[50:37.000 --> 50:41.000]  It's the vampirism, the cultural vampirism, all of it.
[50:41.000 --> 50:44.000]  I just, oh, man, I get out in Big Bend,
[50:44.000 --> 50:46.000]  the middle of the desert.
[50:46.000 --> 50:49.000]  And I feel God so close.
[50:49.000 --> 50:53.000]  I go in some little Mexican cantina with some poor family,
[50:53.000 --> 50:54.000]  cooking enchiladas and tacos.
[50:54.000 --> 50:56.000]  You just feel God's strength so great.
[50:56.000 --> 50:58.000]  You know, I'm not against the poor people
[50:58.000 --> 50:59.000]  that want to be in this country.
[50:59.000 --> 51:01.000]  I'm against how they're being used as a weapon
[51:01.000 --> 51:04.000]  to bring everything down.
[51:04.000 --> 51:06.000]  But Los Angeles is hell on earth.
[51:06.000 --> 51:10.000]  I asked Joe Rogan, I said, how do you live in this hell pit?
[51:10.000 --> 51:13.000]  And he said, well, it's where all my friends are at
[51:13.000 --> 51:16.000]  and it's where I can go test my comedy out on Big Crowds.
[51:16.000 --> 51:18.000]  If Joe Rogan's anything, he's not a podcaster,
[51:18.000 --> 51:22.000]  he's not the top UFC guy at Collins Fights.
[51:22.000 --> 51:29.000]  He is a comedy guy.
[51:29.000 --> 51:32.000]  Well, whatever that biggest comedy place is there in LA,
[51:32.000 --> 51:36.000]  I checked the name, Comedy Store, whatever it's called.
[51:36.000 --> 51:41.000]  I got invited to go speak there next Tuesday
[51:41.000 --> 51:44.000]  and I said, okay, well, and they got so many threats.
[51:44.000 --> 51:46.000]  They said, oh, sorry, you can't come speak here.
[51:46.000 --> 51:48.000]  And by the way, this is a place where you can do anything
[51:48.000 --> 51:50.000]  you want, but see Alex Jones is reboting.
[51:50.000 --> 51:53.000]  Hey, put me in that briar patch every day.
[51:53.000 --> 51:56.000]  That just makes what we do that much stronger
[51:56.000 --> 51:59.000]  because people know, wow, this is the thing,
[51:59.000 --> 52:02.000]  we're really not supposed to hear what this guy's talking about.
[52:02.000 --> 52:07.000]  I mean, these comics said we've never seen anybody banned
[52:07.000 --> 52:09.000]  from speaking at this.
[52:09.000 --> 52:10.000]  Never.
[52:10.000 --> 52:11.000]  Not that it's huge history.
[52:11.000 --> 52:14.000]  And it was just a small stop on all the stuff I'm doing
[52:14.000 --> 52:18.000]  while I'm out there.
[52:18.000 --> 52:19.000]  A lot of surprises next week.
[52:19.000 --> 52:20.000]  Just look for that.
[52:20.000 --> 52:22.000]  I think people can put two and who together.
[52:22.000 --> 52:27.000]  But it's just crazy.
[52:27.000 --> 52:30.000]  It's just abs, and then also the left gets this pleasure.
[52:30.000 --> 52:32.000]  It's like, I went out last Saturday, not this Saturday,
[52:32.000 --> 52:33.000]  but last Saturday with Joe.
[52:33.000 --> 52:34.000]  It was all in the news.
[52:34.000 --> 52:35.000]  What happened?
[52:35.000 --> 52:37.000]  I went and ate at the steak place where he was staying.
[52:37.000 --> 52:38.000]  It was really good.
[52:38.000 --> 52:39.000]  I don't know.
[52:39.000 --> 52:40.000]  It's a hotel steak.
[52:40.000 --> 52:41.000]  It's like the best steak I've ever had.
[52:41.000 --> 52:42.000]  He's like, yeah, I heard it's really good here.
[52:42.000 --> 52:43.000]  So we sit there by the river and have dinner.
[52:43.000 --> 52:44.000]  And he goes, okay, I'm leaving.
[52:44.000 --> 52:45.000]  I got to go do my comedy thing.
[52:45.000 --> 52:46.000]  Okay, great.
[52:46.000 --> 52:49.000]  And my wife didn't like her lobster tacos.
[52:49.000 --> 52:51.000]  They weren't bad, but she didn't like them.
[52:51.000 --> 52:54.000]  Because when you're down in Mexico a few weeks before eating
[52:54.000 --> 52:56.000]  fresh ones, they show you the lobster and kill it versus,
[52:56.000 --> 52:58.000]  you know, the steak was great.
[52:58.000 --> 52:59.000]  The lobster wasn't good.
[52:59.000 --> 53:02.000]  She wanted to go to the Lucy's Fried Chicken where they have
[53:02.000 --> 53:04.000]  the oysters and stuff.
[53:04.000 --> 53:07.000]  Oysters, Rockefeller, she likes those.
[53:07.000 --> 53:08.000]  I was full.
[53:08.000 --> 53:09.000]  I was just drinking beer.
[53:09.000 --> 53:10.000]  I didn't even eat anything.
[53:10.000 --> 53:11.000]  So we're in there.
[53:11.000 --> 53:13.000]  These people come over to yell and scream at us and do all this
[53:13.000 --> 53:15.000]  three times, then confront us when we try to leave.
[53:15.000 --> 53:16.000]  So I blow up at them.
[53:16.000 --> 53:18.000]  To the statesman's credit, they actually went and found out,
[53:18.000 --> 53:19.000]  oh, we lock y'all.
[53:19.000 --> 53:20.000]  It comes in all the time.
[53:20.000 --> 53:21.000]  Big tipper.
[53:21.000 --> 53:22.000]  They started fights with him three times.
[53:22.000 --> 53:23.000]  We threw them out.
[53:23.000 --> 53:25.000]  Now the statesman didn't add that part, but they admitted they
[53:25.000 --> 53:26.000]  started the fight.
[53:26.000 --> 53:28.000]  Now they told those people, your band don't ever come in here.
[53:28.000 --> 53:30.000]  But see, I was leaving.
[53:30.000 --> 53:32.000]  So the news was, Jones is thrown out.
[53:32.000 --> 53:34.000]  And again, it's not about me.
[53:34.000 --> 53:37.000]  It's about how these people lie in the media incessantly.
[53:37.000 --> 53:41.000]  But I was out at the Beto O'Rourke rally last Saturday,
[53:41.000 --> 53:44.000]  about the one before him, just a few days ago.
[53:44.000 --> 53:47.000]  They were all screaming, why'd you get kicked out of Lucy's?
[53:47.000 --> 53:50.000]  Everybody, hey, ah, he got through out of Lucy's.
[53:50.000 --> 53:53.000]  He got, they're like kindergarteners.
[53:53.000 --> 53:57.000]  That was their power is you got through out of Lucy's.
[53:57.000 --> 53:59.000]  Is you got thrown out.
[53:59.000 --> 54:02.000]  You got thrown out.
[54:02.000 --> 54:07.000]  Their mindset are little pathetic follower weaklings who all get
[54:07.000 --> 54:09.000]  in groups and then try to bully people.
[54:09.000 --> 54:11.000]  We've got incredible video next hour coming up with that.
[54:11.000 --> 54:14.000]  It's on m4s.com with this poor old Jewish man wearing his
[54:14.000 --> 54:15.000]  make America great again.
[54:15.000 --> 54:17.000]  And he's like, I wear it because they bully people.
[54:17.000 --> 54:19.000]  I don't want to be bullied, but I've got to stand up against
[54:19.000 --> 54:20.000]  bullies.
[54:20.000 --> 54:21.000]  This is dangerous.
[54:21.000 --> 54:22.000]  She says, I'm going to destroy you.
[54:22.000 --> 54:23.000]  I'm going to get you fired.
[54:23.000 --> 54:24.000]  I'm going to annihilate your life.
[54:24.000 --> 54:25.000]  I'm going to do all this.
[54:25.000 --> 54:29.000]  Of course, she lost her job, but these people are real
[54:29.000 --> 54:30.000]  authoritarians.
[54:30.000 --> 54:31.000]  I don't just throw that word around.
[54:31.000 --> 54:32.000]  They have the instinct.
[54:32.000 --> 54:34.000]  They have the gangsterism.
[54:34.000 --> 54:38.000]  They have the behavior and their nuts.
[54:38.000 --> 54:42.000]  And so yeah, I just wanted to drink my beer and let my wife
[54:42.000 --> 54:43.000]  eat her.
[54:43.000 --> 54:47.000]  And the babysitter had to go home because we ended up
[54:47.000 --> 54:50.000]  letting the babysitter go early because, oh, I didn't
[54:50.000 --> 54:55.000]  know the story.
[54:55.000 --> 54:58.000]  So I was going to go see Joe show the night before because
[54:58.000 --> 55:01.000]  he has Friday and Saturday four shows at the cap city
[55:01.000 --> 55:04.000]  comedy club where I've been 50 times.
[55:04.000 --> 55:08.000]  And all of a sudden the owner calls him up crying and says,
[55:08.000 --> 55:10.000]  you can't have him here.
[55:10.000 --> 55:11.000]  I'm scared.
[55:11.000 --> 55:13.000]  He's so bad when he did to those children.
[55:13.000 --> 55:15.000]  He just keeps attacking him.
[55:15.000 --> 55:19.000]  I heard NPR where he goes to their houses and he's her.
[55:19.000 --> 55:21.000]  And Joe said, you know, that's not true.
[55:21.000 --> 55:22.000]  He never said that.
[55:22.000 --> 55:23.000]  And for years he said it happened.
[55:23.000 --> 55:25.000]  He just said it on my podcast a month ago.
[55:25.000 --> 55:28.000]  And she goes, no, it's not true.
[55:28.000 --> 55:31.000]  Here's a guy that fills up her deal four times all sold out.
[55:31.000 --> 55:32.000]  He's lucky in his own words.
[55:32.000 --> 55:35.000]  He's lucky he goes there.
[55:35.000 --> 55:38.000]  He fills up arenas with 30,000 people now.
[55:38.000 --> 55:41.000]  He goes there to test out his stuff on a crowd of 1,000.
[55:41.000 --> 55:42.000]  And he just called me.
[55:42.000 --> 55:44.000]  He said, look, I'll get you in and make an issue if you
[55:44.000 --> 55:45.000]  want.
[55:45.000 --> 55:46.000]  And I said, no, that's fine, man.
[55:46.000 --> 55:48.000]  I was coming out because you invited me.
[55:48.000 --> 55:50.000]  I was going to see your new comedy stuff.
[55:50.000 --> 55:56.000]  But imagine the mindset where if they were in power,
[55:56.000 --> 56:00.000]  these leftists, they want to take everything from us because
[56:00.000 --> 56:01.000]  they live off us.
[56:01.000 --> 56:03.000]  They live off producers.
[56:03.000 --> 56:07.000]  And so they know we're trying to not be their slaves anymore.
[56:07.000 --> 56:10.000]  And so they're getting pissed.
[56:10.000 --> 56:13.000]  That's what this comes down to.
[56:13.000 --> 56:15.000]  I got a whole other topic I'm going to get to.
[56:15.000 --> 56:17.000]  And I got a big Trump announcement he just made live that
[56:17.000 --> 56:18.000]  thing.
[56:18.000 --> 56:20.000]  I'm going to get to it in a second.
[56:20.000 --> 56:22.000]  I haven't plugged once this hour.
[56:22.000 --> 56:25.000]  And if I do that, if I plug, we can find the operation.
[56:25.000 --> 56:27.000]  If I don't, we get shut down.
[56:27.000 --> 56:30.000]  So I am our biggest enemy around here.
[56:30.000 --> 56:32.000]  I really am.
[56:32.000 --> 56:36.000]  And I appreciate the listeners coming through the way you've
[56:36.000 --> 56:39.000]  come through because we don't have the Mercer's or the
[56:39.000 --> 56:41.000]  Russians or George Soros funding us.
[56:41.000 --> 56:43.000]  The whole damn left, every one of their operations is losing
[56:43.000 --> 56:44.000]  money.
[56:44.000 --> 56:46.000]  And they've all got to get propped up by these billionaire
[56:46.000 --> 56:47.000]  officials.
[56:47.000 --> 56:50.000]  And they just can't believe we're so popular because you
[56:50.000 --> 56:52.000]  support us and spread the word.
[56:52.000 --> 56:54.000]  They just, they just cannot.
[56:54.000 --> 56:57.000]  I've had my own lawyers say, listen, there's no way you
[56:57.000 --> 56:58.000]  find yourself.
[56:58.000 --> 57:00.000]  Give me the Mercer documents.
[57:00.000 --> 57:03.000]  And I say, I've never talked to the Mercer's or got the
[57:03.000 --> 57:04.000]  dollar.
[57:04.000 --> 57:05.000]  It's okay.
[57:05.000 --> 57:07.000]  I know you get the money from them.
[57:07.000 --> 57:09.000]  Just give it to me.
[57:09.000 --> 57:13.000]  And it's because the left, ladies and gentlemen, are
[57:13.000 --> 57:15.000]  children.
[57:15.000 --> 57:18.000]  It's the best thing in their lives.
[57:18.000 --> 57:20.000]  It's crazy to them.
[57:20.000 --> 57:22.000]  Anyways, you built this whole operation.
[57:22.000 --> 57:25.000]  You and I, we built the InfoWars.
[57:25.000 --> 57:26.000]  It's ours.
[57:26.000 --> 57:28.000]  It's America.
[57:28.000 --> 57:30.000]  And it's winning.
[57:30.000 --> 57:32.000]  The sale has to end in the next 48 hours.
[57:32.000 --> 57:34.000]  Free shipping, store-wide.
[57:34.000 --> 57:36.000]  50% to 60% off all supplements.
[57:36.000 --> 57:38.000]  A bunch of other big specials.
[57:38.000 --> 57:40.000]  Get a verboten t-shirt.
[57:40.000 --> 57:43.000]  Just get in there, sign up for auto-ship on things like
[57:43.000 --> 57:45.000]  this.
[57:45.000 --> 57:48.000]  I salute you and I thank you for standing against the
[57:48.000 --> 57:49.000]  enemy.
[57:49.000 --> 57:50.000]  It's simple.
[57:50.000 --> 57:52.000]  If you want to beat the globalist, if you want to take
[57:52.000 --> 57:54.000]  on the new world order, I'm not doing Bitcoin pumping
[57:54.000 --> 57:56.000]  dumps with Jack Dorsey.
[57:56.000 --> 57:58.000]  I'm not sitting here selling you cancer cures.
[57:58.000 --> 58:01.000]  I'm not sitting here, you know, selling you late-term
[58:01.000 --> 58:03.000]  abortion and all the great it is.
[58:03.000 --> 58:05.000]  I just go out and say, what is the top heart pill?
[58:05.000 --> 58:06.000]  What is the top tumor?
[58:06.000 --> 58:08.000]  It's the best seller because it's anti-inflammatory.
[58:08.000 --> 58:10.000]  And what's the best lab in the country?
[58:10.000 --> 58:12.000]  Okay, they're the highest rated.
[58:12.000 --> 58:13.000]  50% curcuminoid?
[58:13.000 --> 58:15.000]  Well, yeah, they only put $5 product and bottle, but
[58:15.000 --> 58:17.000]  that's still incredible, sir.
[58:17.000 --> 58:20.000]  I'm like, what's the highest you could do a month later?
[58:20.000 --> 58:21.000]  90, 95%.
[58:21.000 --> 58:22.000]  No one's ever done that.
[58:22.000 --> 58:24.000]  I said, how much does that cost for a bottle?
[58:24.000 --> 58:25.000]  That costs $10.
[58:25.000 --> 58:26.000]  No one's ever done that, sir.
[58:26.000 --> 58:28.000]  The average competitor is 3% to 5%.
[58:28.000 --> 58:30.000]  The top brand is 50%.
[58:30.000 --> 58:32.000]  I'm like, we're going to have 95% curcuminoid.
[58:32.000 --> 58:34.000]  I mean, you understand, like, that's like our
[58:34.000 --> 58:35.000]  information is explosive.
[58:35.000 --> 58:36.000]  Our fish oil.
[58:36.000 --> 58:38.000]  I go out and I get the cleanest, the best.
[58:38.000 --> 58:39.000]  My children take it.
[58:39.000 --> 58:42.000]  You think I'm going to give you fish oil that isn't
[58:42.000 --> 58:44.000]  the very damn best on my soul?
[58:44.000 --> 58:46.000]  You think I'm going to screw somebody over like one of
[58:46.000 --> 58:47.000]  these devil worshipers?
[58:47.000 --> 59:16.000]  Never in Foresore.com.

[01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:11.000]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:18.000]  You're looking at a true organic expression of the will of humanity to be free.
[01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:22.000]  Just like all the inventions and all the great ideas came from independent tinkers.
[01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:26.000]  And I just love how the left and all of them are like, show us how you're funded by Trump.
[01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:30.000]  Show us who runs you. Show us what you, where you, why you're so successful.
[01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:37.000]  Because I'm not a knuckle dragon low IQ, inbred piece of trash like you.
[01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:41.000]  You damn idiots.
[01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:43.000]  Woo.
[01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:48.000]  Our enemies are pathetic, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:50.000]  Why do you think they want to suppress the general public?
[01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:52.000]  Because they know you're waking people up.
[01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:55.000]  This happened about 30 minutes ago. I was going to play up a sort of ranting.
[01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:59.000]  This is Trump on Mexico and how he is going to shut the border or put huge tariffs on him.
[01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:01.000]  Let's go ahead and roll that right now.
[01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:04.000]  This afternoon, I think you folks are going to be at it for a little while at least.
[01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:08.000]  The vice premier is here and lots of top people from China.
[01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:10.000]  They very much want to make a deal. We'll see what happens.
[01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:14.000]  It's got to be a good deal. It's got to be a great deal.
[01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:22.000]  It's got to be a great look. We've been losing over many years, four, five, 600 billion dollars a year.
[01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:27.000]  We're losing a few years ago, 200 routinely to China. We can't do that.
[01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:29.000]  We're going to turn it around. It's got to be a great deal.
[01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:32.000]  If it's not a great deal, we're not doing it, but it's going very well.
[01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:38.000]  Top officials are here. We're very well along on the deal.
[01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:40.000]  It's a very complex deal. It's a very big deal.
[01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:43.000]  It's one of the biggest deals ever made, maybe the biggest deal ever made.
[01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:50.000]  It'll be a great deal for our farmers. Technology, intellectual property theft.
[01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:53.000]  Everything is covered. There's not a thing that's not covered.
[01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:56.000]  We could have made a quickie, but we're in a very good position.
[01:01:56.000 --> 01:02:03.000]  Our economy is way up. China is not way up, and we're going to either make a very good deal
[01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:05.000]  or we're not going to make a deal at all.
[01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:08.000]  But I think it looks like the deal is moving along very nicely.
[01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:15.000]  So I think you're going to meet me and we're going to say hello to the media for a little while sometime after two o'clock.
[01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:19.000]  Thank you, everybody.
[01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:22.000]  A lot of good things are happening with Mexico.
[01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:28.000]  Mexico understands that we're going to close the border or I'm going to tariff the cars.
[01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:32.000]  I'll do one or the other and probably start off with the tariffs.
[01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:39.000]  That'll be a very powerful incentive because Mexico has the strongest immigration laws anywhere in the world.
[01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:43.000]  They don't have courts like we do. We have a stupid system of courts.
[01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:48.000]  It's the craziest thing in the world. We could be the only country that has it.
[01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:52.000]  You put a foot on the property. You put a foot into the United States.
[01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:56.000]  Congratulations. Go get Perry Mason to represent you.
[01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:58.000]  You end up with a court case.
[01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:03.000]  And then they release you and you come back four or five years later, but nobody comes back.
[01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:06.000]  Two percent come back.
[01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:08.000]  They're not so smart ones come back.
[01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:11.000]  It's the most ridiculous system anyone's ever seen.
[01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:17.000]  And we have catch and release and we have chain migration where somebody comes in and brings the whole family.
[01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:22.000]  They come on your grandparents, your brothers, your sisters, your cousins.
[01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:28.000]  The craziest thing I've ever seen put in by Democrats and the Democrats are going to straighten it out.
[01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:34.000]  And if they don't straighten it out and I predicted this, I mean, I hate to see it, but at least I can say I was right.
[01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:44.000]  I told everybody this is you have a national emergency at our border and nobody even talks about drugs, the drugs that are flowing in.
[01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:49.000]  So for the last four days and you actually have covered it to a very minor extent,
[01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:57.000]  Mexico has been capturing people and bringing it back to their countries at their southern border.
[01:03:57.000 --> 01:04:02.000]  They've been taking people under their very powerful laws.
[01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:06.000]  They have the right to do it and they're bringing it back to where they came from.
[01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:12.000]  That's about three days now, I guess, since frankly, since they heard I was going to close the border.
[01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:20.000]  But before I close the border, if Mexico and we love Mexico, we love the country of Mexico, we have two problems.
[01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:24.000]  We have the fact that they allow people to pour in to our country.
[01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:26.000]  We have to stop them. Border patrol has been incredible.
[01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:29.000]  ICE has been incredible. Law enforcement has been incredible.
[01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:32.000]  And the other problem is drugs.
[01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:41.000]  Massive amounts of a large, most of the drugs, much of the drugs coming into our country come through the southern border in all different ways.
[01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:47.000]  Much of it where we don't have walls, the wall is under construction, by the way, large sections.
[01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:52.000]  We're going to be meeting, I think, on Friday at a piece of the wall that we've completed, a big piece.
[01:04:52.000 --> 01:05:15.000]  A lot of it.
[01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:27.000]  But I want to be a market leader and I want you to have storeable food so it's a total win-win.
[01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:31.000]  We have those incredible sell prices back at m4store.com.
[01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:35.000]  On m4, select storeable foods. They've got special diet foods.
[01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:39.000]  They've got three-month supplies, your supplies, weak emergency supplies.
[01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:41.000]  They've got so many great products there.
[01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:44.000]  And you've got a three-year supply. If stuff happens, you can feed your whole block.
[01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:47.000]  It's up to us to be self-sufficient.
[01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:52.000]  You're buying war bonds, bringing you great products, and together with God's help, we are unstoppable.
[01:05:52.000 --> 01:06:20.000]  m4store.com and m4, select high-quality storeable foods powered by my Patreon supply.
[01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:49.000]  From deep in the heart of FEMA Region 6, Austin, Texas, transmitting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:58.000]  Well, during the break, we've got televisions and satellite feeds to now dozens of cable news channels and things going on.
[01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:04.000]  Satellite feeds, you name it, and I was listening to a Fox News guest.
[01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:07.000]  We're trying to queue it up right now, but they're doing it on the fly in like one minute.
[01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:09.000]  Great crew.
[01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:16.000]  And the guest is admitting that, well, the border's totally collapsed and the border patrol and all the courts are overwhelmed
[01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:20.000]  and there's a six-year backlog, and so basically the country's wide open.
[01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:27.000]  And so Trump's saying he's going to close the border just to hope that people think it's closed and don't come up here,
[01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:31.000]  but it's all just a PR stunt because the border's gone.
[01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:35.000]  And I don't blame the president for trying to make people think, you know, hey, we're going to close it,
[01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:42.000]  but unless he calls out a couple hundred thousand troops and unless he puts major pressure on the Mexican government right now to stop this,
[01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:48.000]  it's done, the country is broken, you break somebody's border, it's over.
[01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:56.000]  And that's what I'm getting at here is the UN plan to break countries is to set up refugee centers, brainwash communists and socialists,
[01:07:56.000 --> 01:08:02.000]  tell them there's all this free crap, send them to our countries in Europe and the U.S., Canada, New Zealand, Australia,
[01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:08.000]  where the leftists pick them up on buses and take them and enroll them on welfare in sanctuary cities
[01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:12.000]  and get them jobs and then skim money off of them and money laundering.
[01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:15.000]  The Democratic Party is a criminal group.
[01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:18.000]  They have converted to the lowest person in the Democratic Party now.
[01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:23.000]  Almost all of them are conscious criminals.
[01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:31.000]  In Aliens, great movie, Paxton, what's that actor's full name?
[01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:39.000]  Paxton says, game over, man, game over, what do you mean they cut the power of their animals, man? Game over.
[01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:42.000]  It's game over.
[01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:50.000]  Ultra elites always use giant populations of dumbed down people to control society and in middle classes.
[01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:54.000]  Middle classes are the enemy of elites.
[01:08:54.000 --> 01:09:00.000]  Just like firstborns were the enemies of ancient kings, they were always ordering them sacrificed.
[01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:05.000]  So that's what this comes down to.
[01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:14.000]  Speaking of that, there's a big article up on infowars.com of a Qatari sociologist he's called.
[01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:15.000]  So it's okay, I guess.
[01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:17.000]  It's a Paul Joseph Watson article.
[01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:19.000]  It was Rob Dude discovered this.
[01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:27.000]  On YouTube, on Islamic Health Channel, talking about how you're supposed to beat your wife.
[01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:32.000]  And I've seen the articles where the Islamists are saying, hey, you know what?
[01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:39.000]  It's getting a little bit embarrassing that Muslims are going to jail, breaking their wives' noses, killing them, doing all that.
[01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:46.000]  We haven't taken America and Europe over yet.
[01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:52.000]  So we've got to come out and say, oh, no, it's a loving slap.
[01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:53.000]  It's a loving hit.
[01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:58.000]  And so really what this is, is shoppedling what Islam does.
[01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:02.000]  We're going to show you, if you're a TV viewer, radio listeners are lucky, they don't see this.
[01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:10.000]  Just type in women, acid attacks, or women, acid Islam.
[01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:15.000]  And you'll see their whole faces burn off in the most monstrous things you could ever imagine.
[01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:19.000]  Millions of women every decade or so are killed in Islam.
[01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:22.000]  Hell, the family gets around and stones their mothers, stones their daughters.
[01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:28.000]  They cut their noses off, burn their faces off, cut their clitoris off when they're born.
[01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:30.000]  And this is just standard Islam.
[01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:36.000]  You've got all these different members of Islam that have gotten into Congress, two of them.
[01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:43.000]  And you've got the other usual suspects that lead women's marches saying, this is Islam.
[01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:47.000]  We need to keep doing it.
[01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:52.000]  So think about that, and you've got the left out.
[01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:55.000]  I mean, I told you I was in Isla Mejara, is an island off Mexico.
[01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:57.000]  There was a gay wedding at the hotel we were at.
[01:10:57.000 --> 01:11:03.000]  And I watched for three days, the gay guys try to kiss the ass of all these Muslims that were there wearing burqas.
[01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:05.000]  And the women would go, get away from me.
[01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:06.000]  Get away.
[01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:07.000]  Get away.
[01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:08.000]  They would talk.
[01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:11.000]  And the gay guys would grovel, oh, oh, God, you're a Muslim.
[01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:16.000]  But guaranteed those guys probably hate me because I'm a libertarian.
[01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:21.000]  I mean, it's just, it's like a fetish to love your destroyers, to love your usurpers,
[01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:25.000]  to love those who destroy Western civilization, all the egalitarian freedom.
[01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:29.000]  We have that these very people take advantage of and they don't care.
[01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:32.000]  You never see the women on TV, the thousands of acid attacks.
[01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:34.000]  They have hundreds a month in London.
[01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:39.000]  Women out in their faces burn off, and boy, it's covered up real fast.
[01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:43.000]  So I'm going to have to narrate this report.
[01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:44.000]  We'll put it back on screen for me real quick.
[01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:47.000]  I want to give people the headline because it's in Arabic.
[01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:54.000]  Muslim sociologist gives instructional video on how to reportedly beat your wife.
[01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:56.000]  Now, here's the deal.
[01:11:56.000 --> 01:12:02.000]  It's the Muslims, though, I got to give them credit, who are protesting drag queen storytime
[01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:06.000]  and teaching five-year-olds how to give blowjobs in England because that's what they do.
[01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:10.000]  They have other adults come in from Nambla, basically, posing as drag queen storytime
[01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:14.000]  and tell your kids that the boy can be a girl and a girl can be a boy.
[01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:17.000]  Why would you put up with anybody else doing that?
[01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:19.000]  So at least the Muslims have got that.
[01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:25.000]  The left and modern West is so bad, maybe Islam is a liberator because here's the truth.
[01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:32.000]  I've never slapped my two wives around, but I'll tell you at the end of the day,
[01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:38.000]  kissing women's ass all day and doing whatever they want when they're getting grumpy moods or whatever
[01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:40.000]  only makes it worse.
[01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:44.000]  So in a sick, weird way, there are some sick women like to be slapped around.
[01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:46.000]  I'm not into that.
[01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:52.000]  But see, what's sicker teaching a kid, a five-year-old kid how to have sex with other people?
[01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:56.000]  Is that worse or slapping your wife around, which I'm against?
[01:12:56.000 --> 01:13:00.000]  But the point is the left totally defends this and covers up for it.
[01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:03.000]  But because men now are not ever standing up for themselves,
[01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:08.000]  now a lot of women are actually marrying Muslims, a lot of liberal women marry them, and they like it.
[01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:13.000]  In fact, statistically, liberal women are more into being slapped, beaten.
[01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:15.000]  I've got a buddy who's in politics.
[01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:18.000]  He likes to date leftist women.
[01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:24.000]  And he found that they're the ones that want to be degraded, slapped around, called a pig, all this.
[01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:25.000]  See, that's not women I'm into.
[01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:26.000]  I'm into my wife.
[01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:30.000]  But the point is that that's who these people are, and they love Islam.
[01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:32.000]  They love Fifty Shades of Grey.
[01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:36.000]  Let's go ahead and play this sickening video.
[01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:40.000]  Dear viewers, many people, especially people who are married,
[01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:44.000]  would like to know how to beat one's wife.
[01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:47.000]  How does a husband beat his wife?
[01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:49.000]  He gives her disciplinary beating out of love.
[01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:54.000]  He loves her.
[01:13:54.000 --> 01:14:01.000]  The beating should be light and must make the wife feel her femininity and her husband's masculinity.
[01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:07.000]  Now, let's see how Islam teaches how to beat your wife.
[01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:12.000]  The husband must make his wife feel his strength.
[01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:14.000]  Why aren't you listening to me?
[01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:16.000]  How many times am I about to tell you?
[01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:17.000]  How many times am I about to tell you?
[01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:21.000]  So listen, am I about to tell you not to leave the house without permission?
[01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:22.000]  Hit pause there.
[01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:26.000]  Back it up, please.
[01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:29.000]  So again, he's here whitewashing this whole thing.
[01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:31.000]  People out on YouTube, Twitter, everywhere.
[01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:33.000]  And I say, leave it up. This maniac has his rights.
[01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:35.000]  But I can't be on there.
[01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:37.000]  But this guy can sit there and do all this.
[01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:41.000]  Let's continue.
[01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:44.000]  You see a little bit of a rebuke.
[01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:47.000]  Obviously, she's starting to talk back.
[01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:48.000]  I told you not to leave the house.
[01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:49.000]  How many times am I telling you?
[01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:51.000]  See how he's beating.
[01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:54.000]  Back it up again. He's talking too fast.
[01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:56.000]  And I'm reading this here, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:14:56.000 --> 01:14:58.000]  Go back. Hit play.
[01:14:58.000 --> 01:14:59.000]  See how the beating?
[01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:01.000]  I told you not to leave the house.
[01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:03.000]  The beating is light.
[01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:04.000]  Don't leave the house again.
[01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:06.000]  Do you understand? Yes or no?
[01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:09.000]  You see, brothers, this is the beating of Islam.
[01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:13.000]  But some people punch her or slap her in the face.
[01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:14.000]  That's not allowed.
[01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:18.000]  The Prophet Muhammad, look how merciful Islam is.
[01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:23.000]  The Prophet forbid striking the face.
[01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:25.000]  Clapping the face, hitting the head, punching the nose.
[01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:30.000]  All this is prohibited.
[01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:31.000]  The beating is for discipline.
[01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:32.000]  Don't leave the house again.
[01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:33.000]  Listen to what I'm saying.
[01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:34.000]  And then it goes on from there.
[01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:39.000]  It's all up on infowars.com and newswars.com.
[01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:40.000]  We've got more of this.
[01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:43.000]  Robert Barnes is coming up infowars.com, newswars.com.
[01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:57.000]  Tomorrow's news today.
[01:15:57.000 --> 01:15:59.000]  Ooh, get the stinky dog away from me.
[01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:01.000]  Bad breath and bad gas.
[01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:02.000]  PD stopped eating.
[01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:03.000]  All of his hair fell out.
[01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:05.000]  Itching, licking, missing fur.
[01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:07.000]  At least $5,000.
[01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:10.000]  And that bill creams, antibiotics, sprays.
[01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:11.000]  No results.
[01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:14.000]  Everything we tried failed except the Dynavite.
[01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:16.000]  D-I-N-O-V-I-T-E.com.
[01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:19.000]  If you want the dog to be healthy, you got to feed this hungry healthy.
[01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:21.000]  The Omega-3 fatty acids.
[01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:24.000]  Black seed, zinc, alfalfa, the digestive enzymes
[01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:27.000]  that are cooked out of regular dog food.
[01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:29.000]  Dynavite is nutrition.
[01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:31.000]  The shedding is stopped and the itching is stopped.
[01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:32.000]  Her coat is not soft.
[01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:33.000]  It's silky.
[01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:36.000]  It's healthy and shiny and glossy.
[01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:37.000]  She's got life.
[01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:38.000]  She's got energy.
[01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:39.000]  Tons of energy.
[01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:40.000]  No more bad smells.
[01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:41.000]  Dynavite's the mom.
[01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:44.000]  Dynavite is the best thing that's ever happened to my dogs.
[01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:46.000]  You know, besides me, of course.
[01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:49.000]  8-5-9-4-2-8-1,000.
[01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:52.000]  8-5-9-4-2-8-1,000.
[01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:53.000]  Dynavite for life.
[01:16:53.000 --> 01:17:20.000]  D-I-N-O-V-I-T-E.com.
[01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:23.000]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:25.000]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:27.000]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look
[01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:29.000]  and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:31.000]  I recommend heart and body extract to everyone.
[01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:34.000]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent
[01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:37.000]  should be using this product as a preventative
[01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:39.000]  to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.
[01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:41.000]  Order your two-month supply today

[01:17:58.000 --> 01:18:01.000]  There are thousands of ideologies out there.
[01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:03.000]  Hundreds of different political systems,
[01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:06.000]  and most of them are funded by the globalist.
[01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:09.000]  Infowars is truly the tip of the spear of the zeitgeist.
[01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:11.000]  That's why the globalists are obsessed with it,
[01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:13.000]  trying to shut it down.
[01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:15.000]  I didn't invent all this.
[01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:17.000]  It's the Renaissance, Americana,
[01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:19.000]  and what really works for humanity,
[01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:21.000]  and I'm simply trying to bring it back.
[01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:23.000]  And lo and behold, it's super popular,
[01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:25.000]  like it's always been.
[01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:27.000]  That's why the globalists are trying to shut it down
[01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:30.000]  so desperately, because we have the light
[01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:33.000]  in the dark of the night that sends chills at my spine.
[01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:35.000]  So whatever you do, continue to support yourself
[01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:37.000]  and Infowars by buying the great products
[01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:40.000]  at InfowarsTour.com, by spreading the articles,
[01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:43.000]  by spreading the videos, and by praying for this operation
[01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:46.000]  for this nation and the world for peace and discernment.
[01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:48.000]  For myself and the whole Infowars family,
[01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:51.000]  I want to thank all of you for what you've done,
[01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:54.000]  because without you, Infowars is nothing.
[01:18:54.000 --> 01:18:57.000]  You are the Infowars, and I salute you.
[01:18:58.000 --> 01:19:01.000]  I've been doing a lot of research into Google
[01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:03.000]  and YouTube censorship,
[01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:07.000]  and I've noticed that there's one type of video
[01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:10.000]  that is the most censored, the most buried,
[01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:14.000]  the most suppressed, and that's the videos
[01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:17.000]  where you saw in 2016 election night
[01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:20.000]  all the arrogant, leftist authoritarians,
[01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:22.000]  like the young turds and others,
[01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:24.000]  get so butt-hurt when Trump won.
[01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:26.000]  They don't want us to have that victory.
[01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:30.000]  They don't want us to remember what political action did,
[01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:33.000]  and that's why the globalists, Hillary and others,
[01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:35.000]  are trying to shut Infowars down.
[01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:38.000]  This is a fight about taking your speech away,
[01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:41.000]  my speech about taking your very sovereignty away.
[01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:43.000]  This country is in a war.
[01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:45.000]  So again, I want to thank you for what you've done,
[01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:47.000]  but I want to remind you,
[01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:49.000]  if you don't spread the articles and videos,
[01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:51.000]  and if you don't financially get the great products we have
[01:19:51.000 --> 01:19:54.000]  and fund us in the 360 wind, we're dead in the water.
[01:19:54.000 --> 01:19:56.000]  I'm in your hands, you're in my hands.
[01:19:56.000 --> 01:20:09.000]  This is InfowarsStore.com. Thank you.
[01:20:27.000 --> 01:20:31.000]  There are new concerns that anti-Trump FBI officials
[01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:34.000]  formed even a secret society at the FBI
[01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:37.000]  to subvert the president after his election.
[01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:38.000]  So let's stop there.
[01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:39.000]  A secret society,
[01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:42.000]  a secret meetings offside of the Justice Department.
[01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:43.000]  Correct.
[01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:45.000]  Really, secret societies, you can't make this stuff up.
[01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:47.000]  Let me give you one bottom line.
[01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:48.000]  As the former government official,
[01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:51.000]  government's going to kill this guy.
[01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:53.000]  You take on the intelligence community.
[01:20:53.000 --> 01:20:56.000]  They have six ways from Sunday of getting back at you.
[01:20:56.000 --> 01:20:59.000]  It's one giant incestuous circle of corruption.
[01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:01.000]  Look, the CIA is a rogue agency.
[01:21:01.000 --> 01:21:04.000]  The White House and the president are citing Infowars.
[01:21:04.000 --> 01:21:07.000]  We have to start getting ready for insurrection and civil war
[01:21:07.000 --> 01:21:09.000]  because they're really pushing it.
[01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:11.000]  What are we going to do if they kill the president
[01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:13.000]  and then order their local governments
[01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:15.000]  and their local federal branches to come arrest
[01:21:15.000 --> 01:21:18.000]  thousands of resistance leaders?
[01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:21.000]  If they kill Trump or remove Trump,
[01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:25.000]  it will cause a massive civil war in this country.
[01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:28.000]  This is a female high-level emergency.
[01:21:28.000 --> 01:21:30.000]  This is a national emergency.
[01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:32.000]  Important instructions will follow.
[01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:33.000]  We work.
[01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:34.000]  And it's not comfortable.
[01:21:34.000 --> 01:21:35.000]  For the federal,
[01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:37.000]  but that will help our state
[01:21:37.000 --> 01:21:39.000]  have a high-quality review.
[01:21:39.000 --> 01:21:40.000]  Shut down.
[01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:41.000]  Remain calm.
[01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:44.000]  Go indoors immediately and stay indoors.
[01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:46.000]  This is an emergency broadcast from FEMA.
[01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:49.000]  In compliance with the United Nations,
[01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:53.000]  the Department of Homeland Security has declared more so.
[01:21:53.000 --> 01:21:56.000]  City officials have called for military help.
[01:21:56.000 --> 01:21:58.000]  Planes and troops are expected to arrive
[01:21:58.000 --> 01:22:00.000]  within the next two hours.
[01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:08.000]  If you are receiving this transmission,
[01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:10.000]  you are in resistance.
[01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:20.000]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:24.000]  From the front lines of the Information War,
[01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:26.000]  it's Alex Jones.
[01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:34.000]  Strange days have found us.
[01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:43.000]  Strange days have tracked us down.
[01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:51.000]  They're going to destroy.
[01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:59.000]  I'll catch you with your eyes.
[01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:05.000]  I'll catch you with your eyes.
[01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:09.000]  Silicon Valley has been operating like a mafia don.
[01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:12.000]  Facebook is being slapped with yet another lawsuit.
[01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:13.000]  It comes, by the way,
[01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:16.000]  of Washington D.C.'s Attorney General Carl Racine,
[01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:20.000]  who labeled the social network a digital gangster Friday
[01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:22.000]  in a D.C.'s superior court.
[01:23:22.000 --> 01:23:24.000]  And another ex-Google employee, David Gooderman,
[01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:26.000]  are suing that company.
[01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:33.000]  A Republican lawmaker is suing Twitter for $250 million,
[01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:36.000]  alleging defamation and claiming he is the victim
[01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:39.000]  of hundreds of hateful tweets.
[01:23:39.000 --> 01:23:41.000]  Apple's situation from an antitrust perspective,
[01:23:41.000 --> 01:23:43.000]  I think, is going to be hard to defend.
[01:23:43.000 --> 01:23:45.000]  Because at the end of the day,
[01:23:45.000 --> 01:23:49.000]  the issues that we worry about with other monopolists
[01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:50.000]  come to bear here,
[01:23:50.000 --> 01:23:53.000]  which is this notion of being a market maker
[01:23:53.000 --> 01:23:56.000]  and at the same time being the owner
[01:23:56.000 --> 01:23:58.000]  of one of the participants in the market.
[01:23:58.000 --> 01:24:01.000]  Whether it's the Bill of Rights or advertising competition,
[01:24:01.000 --> 01:24:03.000]  the little people have been stepped on
[01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:07.000]  by overzealous nerds saturated with tech-dominated power
[01:24:07.000 --> 01:24:10.000]  and given slaps on the wrist by the U.S. Congress
[01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:15.000]  after blatantly violating our First Amendment rights.
[01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:17.000]  So you're telling me nothing at all in China?
[01:24:17.000 --> 01:24:19.000]  We do provide, for example, Android,
[01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:21.000]  which is an operating system.
[01:24:21.000 --> 01:24:23.000]  We work with partners around the world,
[01:24:23.000 --> 01:24:26.000]  and there are OEM manufacturers around the world,
[01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:27.000]  including in China.
[01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:30.000]  So manufacturers, but beyond manufacturers,
[01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:33.000]  any other platform use?
[01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:37.000]  We don't have any special agreements on user data.
[01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:38.000]  The Chinese government.
[01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:39.000]  That's right.
[01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:42.000]  However, in Europe, the tables are slowly turning
[01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:44.000]  on the Silicon Valley overlords.
[01:24:44.000 --> 01:24:49.000]  Of course, the little people are still going to get the short end.
[01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:51.000]  New regulators have been pummeling Google
[01:24:51.000 --> 01:24:55.000]  with antitrust penalties, multi-billion-dollar fines
[01:24:55.000 --> 01:24:58.000]  that have been generally laughed off as parking tickets.
[01:24:58.000 --> 01:25:01.000]  Recently, as WRAL reported,
[01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:03.000]  the EU's competition commissioner,
[01:25:03.000 --> 01:25:06.000]  Margaret Vestiger, announced the results
[01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:10.000]  of the long-running probe of Google's AdSense advertising business
[01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:12.000]  at a news conference in Brussels.
[01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:16.000]  The commission found that Google and its parent company, Alphabet,
[01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:20.000]  breached EU antitrust rules by imposing restrictive clauses
[01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:24.000]  and contracts with websites that use AdSense,
[01:25:24.000 --> 01:25:28.000]  preventing Google rivals from placing their ads on these sites.
[01:25:28.000 --> 01:25:31.000]  Following the Christchurch New Zealand shooting,
[01:25:31.000 --> 01:25:34.000]  the threat of arrests in Silicon Valley
[01:25:34.000 --> 01:25:37.000]  is starting to get a real response.
[01:25:37.000 --> 01:25:40.000]  And now Mark Zuckerberg has raised the white flag
[01:25:40.000 --> 01:25:44.000]  after sheepishly banning white nationalists from his platform.
[01:25:44.000 --> 01:25:48.000]  He believes new regulation is needed in four areas across the Internet.
[01:25:48.000 --> 01:25:53.000]  Harmful content, election integrity, privacy, and data portability.
[01:25:53.000 --> 01:25:57.000]  Zuckerberg said every day we make decisions about what speech is harmful,
[01:25:57.000 --> 01:26:00.000]  what constitutes political advertising,
[01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:03.000]  and how to prevent sophisticated cyber attacks.
[01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:06.000]  Zuckerberg is panicking from taking all the blame
[01:26:06.000 --> 01:26:10.000]  for getting mega-rich off a platform liable from everything
[01:26:10.000 --> 01:26:15.000]  from live-streaming mass shootings to organizing genocide in Myanmar.
[01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:20.000]  But in the end, Silicon Valley's power-mad mistakes and submission
[01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:25.000]  could transform the Internet into something resembling China's social credit system,
[01:26:25.000 --> 01:26:30.000]  where everything you do online is monitored and used against the individual
[01:26:30.000 --> 01:26:33.000]  in the name of centralized control,
[01:26:33.000 --> 01:26:38.000]  rendering the old Internet a once-useful tool for humankind.
[01:26:38.000 --> 01:26:41.000]  We are slowly venturing into the unknown,
[01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:44.000]  as online freedom becomes a thing of the past.
[01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:46.000]  John Bowne reporting.
[01:26:46.000 --> 01:26:49.000]  You know, someone very profoundly once said many years ago
[01:26:49.000 --> 01:26:51.000]  that if fascism ever comes to America,
[01:26:51.000 --> 01:26:53.000]  it'll come in the name of liberalism.
[01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:56.000]  I'm a nasty woman.
[01:26:58.000 --> 01:26:59.000]  All right.
[01:26:59.000 --> 01:27:01.000]  You are receiving this transmission.
[01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:03.000]  You are the resistance.
[01:27:03.000 --> 01:27:05.000]  Robert Barnes is our guest,
[01:27:05.000 --> 01:27:08.000]  and I don't want to sit here and make this show about my shelf,
[01:27:08.000 --> 01:27:10.000]  so we're not going to spend a lot of time in the next hour and a half
[01:27:10.000 --> 01:27:12.000]  that is going to be with us and taking some calls
[01:27:12.000 --> 01:27:15.000]  towards the end of the next hour talking about my case
[01:27:15.000 --> 01:27:17.000]  and what's going on and the attack on the First Amendment.
[01:27:17.000 --> 01:27:20.000]  But there are a lot of big headlines out there,
[01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:22.000]  so we'll do part of one segment.
[01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:24.000]  Robert, if you're good for that.
[01:27:24.000 --> 01:27:25.000]  Sure.
[01:27:25.000 --> 01:27:27.000]  When we come back with all these different headlines
[01:27:27.000 --> 01:27:33.000]  and all this different disinformation that is out there in the news,
[01:27:33.000 --> 01:27:35.000]  because they admit this is the kill shot.
[01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:37.000]  This is take out the First Amendment.
[01:27:37.000 --> 01:27:39.000]  They're also trying to get Tucker Carlson now
[01:27:39.000 --> 01:27:43.000]  because he has more viewers than all of CNN combined.
[01:27:43.000 --> 01:27:46.000]  And so their response is he's racist taking him off the gear.
[01:27:46.000 --> 01:27:48.000]  It's the same thing over and over again.
[01:27:48.000 --> 01:27:50.000]  Yeah, it's the press and the politicians
[01:27:50.000 --> 01:27:52.000]  and groups like Media Matters who are using the case
[01:27:52.000 --> 01:27:57.000]  and using various tactics including these advertisement suppression
[01:27:57.000 --> 01:27:59.000]  where they're trying to basically prevent advertisers
[01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:02.000]  from advertising and supporting people like Tucker Carlson,
[01:28:02.000 --> 01:28:05.000]  trying to go after, obviously, the deep platform across the board.
[01:28:05.000 --> 01:28:09.000]  You now have Zuckerberg wanting the state to sort of officially approve
[01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:11.000]  and sanction his censorship activities.
[01:28:11.000 --> 01:28:13.000]  So it's systematic.
[01:28:13.000 --> 01:28:14.000]  It's across the board.
[01:28:14.000 --> 01:28:17.000]  You're seeing in Georgia even a Republican legislator suggesting
[01:28:17.000 --> 01:28:21.000]  setting up a journalistic board that's now going to have the government regulate
[01:28:21.000 --> 01:28:24.000]  who is and who isn't in the media, who can and can't speak.
[01:28:24.000 --> 01:28:27.000]  And Christina Amanpour has told me online,
[01:28:27.000 --> 01:28:29.000]  shouldn't we arrest people that criticize Hillary?
[01:28:29.000 --> 01:28:32.000]  Yeah, she said, if you say lock her up, then you should lock them up.
[01:28:32.000 --> 01:28:34.000]  And even Comey was like, that's crazy. That's insane.
[01:28:34.000 --> 01:28:36.000]  But that shows inside the bubble.
[01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:38.000]  Let's play that first when we come back.
[01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:39.000]  That's something you can't play enough.
[01:28:39.000 --> 01:28:41.000]  I've only played it once the last three days.
[01:28:41.000 --> 01:28:42.000]  I should have played like every segment.
[01:28:42.000 --> 01:28:43.000]  I can say it was one of the things I read.
[01:28:43.000 --> 01:28:45.000]  The headline is like, no way it was that bad.
[01:28:45.000 --> 01:28:47.000]  We're going to play that next month in the hearing.
[01:28:47.000 --> 01:28:48.000]  Like, Judge, is this what you are?
[01:28:48.000 --> 01:28:50.000]  I mean, you know, lock Alex Jones up.
[01:28:50.000 --> 01:28:52.000]  Because that's what they shouted at me at the Vita round.
[01:28:52.000 --> 01:28:54.000]  They go, arrest him! The media pointed at me.
[01:28:54.000 --> 01:28:56.000]  He goes, get him! Get him! Arrest him!
[01:28:56.000 --> 01:28:57.000]  Exactly.
[01:28:57.000 --> 01:28:59.000]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.
[01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:01.000]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago
[01:29:01.000 --> 01:29:03.000]  when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[01:29:03.000 --> 01:29:04.000]  I sued the IRS in one.
[01:29:04.000 --> 01:29:07.000]  I beat the IRS then, and I've been beating them ever since.
[01:29:07.000 --> 01:29:09.000]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement,
[01:29:09.000 --> 01:29:11.000]  and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems
[01:29:11.000 --> 01:29:13.000]  they thought might never be solved.
[01:29:13.000 --> 01:29:14.000]  I can help you, too.
[01:29:14.000 --> 01:29:17.000]  If you owe taxes you can't pay, don't wait another day.
[01:29:17.000 --> 01:29:19.000]  There's no such thing as a hopeless tax case.
[01:29:19.000 --> 01:29:22.000]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX or go to my website,

[01:33:30.000 --> 01:33:49.000]  Well, how Marxist are you?
[01:33:49.000 --> 01:34:05.000]  You should have gone for the head.
[01:34:05.000 --> 01:34:06.000]  Can you do me one favor?
[01:34:06.000 --> 01:34:09.000]  Can you say I ate lunch at Google?
[01:34:09.000 --> 01:34:11.000]  I ate lunch at Google.
[01:34:11.000 --> 01:34:15.000]  I don't know why I just said I ate lunch at Google.
[01:34:15.000 --> 01:34:20.000]  I feel like I'm at a Beatles gym set.
[01:34:20.000 --> 01:34:33.000]  It's not funny!
[01:34:33.000 --> 01:34:38.000]  This is The Purge.
[01:34:38.000 --> 01:34:50.000]  I feel sorry for people like Candace Owens, Kanye West.

[01:34:54.000 --> 01:35:17.000]  You may be an ambassador to England, girlfriend.

[01:35:32.000 --> 01:35:34.000]  but you're going to have to serve some...
[01:35:34.000 --> 01:35:36.000]  Alex Jones here back live, Robert Barnes,
[01:35:36.000 --> 01:35:39.000]  is my head legal counsel.
[01:35:39.000 --> 01:35:41.000]  I don't want to spend more than one segment on this one.
[01:35:41.000 --> 01:35:43.000]  We've got a lot of news, a lot of clips,
[01:35:43.000 --> 01:35:46.000]  a lot of big developments to cover with him while he's with us,
[01:35:46.000 --> 01:35:49.000]  and I went up the phones up in the second half of the next hour
[01:35:49.000 --> 01:35:53.000]  here on this Thursday, April 4th, 2019, global transmission.

[01:36:02.000 --> 01:36:04.000]  Close to the end of the day, I just haven't gotten around to new specials
[01:36:04.000 --> 01:36:06.000]  and figuring out what we've got.
[01:36:06.000 --> 01:36:07.000]  We're selling out a lot of things.
[01:36:07.000 --> 01:36:10.000]  Fish oil is selling out, rainforest is selling out,
[01:36:10.000 --> 01:36:12.000]  the toothpaste is selling out,
[01:36:12.000 --> 01:36:15.000]  fluoride-free, colloidal silver, iodine-fortified, so much.
[01:36:15.000 --> 01:36:18.000]  DNA force came back in, but it's so good I'm offering it.
[01:36:18.000 --> 01:36:22.000]  That's 60% off. That's all there at infowarstore.com.
[01:36:22.000 --> 01:36:26.000]  But I wanted to just set the record straight, Robert.
[01:36:26.000 --> 01:36:31.000]  We've been trying to get you into this case for a month or so in Texas,
[01:36:31.000 --> 01:36:33.000]  and for whatever reason it hadn't happened.
[01:36:33.000 --> 01:36:35.000]  The judge asked, why weren't you in here earlier?
[01:36:35.000 --> 01:36:37.000]  Because the judge seemed to actually listen to you
[01:36:37.000 --> 01:36:39.000]  and, you know, reverse some of what we've been seeing.
[01:36:39.000 --> 01:36:43.000]  But here's just some of these headlines.
[01:36:43.000 --> 01:36:46.000]  This is one out of the statesmen that's actually pretty accurate.
[01:36:46.000 --> 01:36:50.000]  New defense lawyers switch a strategy in Alex Jones' case,
[01:36:50.000 --> 01:36:52.000]  and then some of the media is spinning it.
[01:36:52.000 --> 01:36:54.000]  Oh, Jones doesn't want to argue the facts.
[01:36:54.000 --> 01:36:56.000]  It admits he's lying. No.
[01:36:56.000 --> 01:36:58.000]  Obviously, they don't know the...
[01:36:58.000 --> 01:37:00.000]  I mean, they know the general public doesn't understand law at all.
[01:37:00.000 --> 01:37:02.000]  There's called the law and the facts.
[01:37:02.000 --> 01:37:04.000]  We're just saying we're not even arguing
[01:37:04.000 --> 01:37:06.000]  how many angels dance on the head of a pin
[01:37:06.000 --> 01:37:07.000]  and all these edited videos.
[01:37:07.000 --> 01:37:09.000]  We're saying, do you have the right to say it or not?
[01:37:09.000 --> 01:37:10.000]  So let's get into yesterday's hearing.
[01:37:10.000 --> 01:37:11.000]  Precisely.
[01:37:11.000 --> 01:37:14.000]  So this case is going to be the foundational, fundamental
[01:37:14.000 --> 01:37:16.000]  First Amendment case in this country.
[01:37:16.000 --> 01:37:18.000]  It's going to determine the scope of the free press.
[01:37:18.000 --> 01:37:21.000]  Is the press still free? Is speech still free?
[01:37:21.000 --> 01:37:24.000]  So in this particular case, as was identified by the court,
[01:37:24.000 --> 01:37:26.000]  the question is, is there a zone of danger
[01:37:26.000 --> 01:37:29.000]  whereby certain speech cannot be made,
[01:37:29.000 --> 01:37:33.000]  whereby the press cannot comment, cannot talk, cannot say anything?
[01:37:33.000 --> 01:37:35.000]  And so this is a unique case, a novel case
[01:37:35.000 --> 01:37:37.000]  that's going to establish that issue.
[01:37:37.000 --> 01:37:40.000]  It's going to go up, I believe, all the way up to the United States Supreme Court.
[01:37:40.000 --> 01:37:42.000]  What is the scope? Do we still have free press?
[01:37:42.000 --> 01:37:44.000]  Do we still have free speech?
[01:37:44.000 --> 01:37:46.000]  Or certain subjects, something you can't talk about?
[01:37:46.000 --> 01:37:48.000]  Or certain areas you can't talk about?
[01:37:48.000 --> 01:37:49.000]  Or certain investigations?
[01:37:49.000 --> 01:37:53.000]  And you make the point, questioning who really killed OJ's wife
[01:37:53.000 --> 01:37:55.000]  nowadays that people would sue over that.
[01:37:55.000 --> 01:37:57.000]  I mean, it's hurtful to say somebody else said it,
[01:37:57.000 --> 01:37:59.000]  but the public hasn't right to question.
[01:37:59.000 --> 01:38:01.000]  Absolutely. For example, I mean, that's some of the issues.
[01:38:01.000 --> 01:38:03.000]  Agatha Christie, TV shows can be illegal.
[01:38:03.000 --> 01:38:06.000]  I mean, the way you say it in here is questioning anything,
[01:38:06.000 --> 01:38:09.000]  because I won't say this poor woman's name, they admit it.
[01:38:09.000 --> 01:38:12.000]  They never said her name or even talked about her.
[01:38:12.000 --> 01:38:15.000]  So when I read the article, I won't even say her name here,
[01:38:15.000 --> 01:38:16.000]  because they'll try to twist that.
[01:38:16.000 --> 01:38:19.000]  Absolutely. The objective is to make clear,
[01:38:19.000 --> 01:38:22.000]  traditionally the law has said you have to make a specific false statement
[01:38:22.000 --> 01:38:25.000]  about a specific person for that to be actionable.
[01:38:25.000 --> 01:38:29.000]  Otherwise, you have free press, free speech to comment as you see fit.
[01:38:29.000 --> 01:38:31.000]  And one of the key things here is, for example,
[01:38:31.000 --> 01:38:35.000]  one of the legal theories that is being promoted by various politicians,
[01:38:35.000 --> 01:38:37.000]  various members of the press and others,
[01:38:37.000 --> 01:38:40.000]  is that if you challenge who committed a crime,
[01:38:40.000 --> 01:38:42.000]  and it turns out you're wrong,
[01:38:42.000 --> 01:38:46.000]  then the victim could sue you for intentional infliction of emotional distress
[01:38:46.000 --> 01:38:48.000]  under the legal theory that's being pursued here.
[01:38:48.000 --> 01:38:50.000]  That is a very dangerous precedent,
[01:38:50.000 --> 01:38:54.000]  because most innocent people are people that are wrongfully accused
[01:38:54.000 --> 01:38:57.000]  or actual guilty people that otherwise would escape justice
[01:38:57.000 --> 01:39:00.000]  are often caught by citizen journalists, ordinary people,
[01:39:00.000 --> 01:39:03.000]  raising questions about what happened, how it happened,
[01:39:03.000 --> 01:39:05.000]  who did it, who participated, who-
[01:39:05.000 --> 01:39:09.000]  The system wants to put out its narrative and make it illegal to question it.
[01:39:09.000 --> 01:39:13.000]  Precisely. This is about is the state-approved, state-sanctioned narrative,
[01:39:13.000 --> 01:39:15.000]  the only narrative that will be allowed.
[01:39:15.000 --> 01:39:17.000]  It's the same thing that Zuckerberg is doing with Facebook now
[01:39:17.000 --> 01:39:19.000]  when he's pitching for state regulation.
[01:39:19.000 --> 01:39:22.000]  He wants to say only the state-sanctioned narrative is allowed,
[01:39:22.000 --> 01:39:24.000]  only the state-supported narrative is allowed.
[01:39:24.000 --> 01:39:26.000]  Then that narrative is put out by lobbyists,
[01:39:26.000 --> 01:39:28.000]  certified by government, senators say what's allowed.
[01:39:28.000 --> 01:39:31.000]  I've noticed the Democrat senators, they say what they want and it's done a week later.
[01:39:31.000 --> 01:39:32.000]  Precisely.
[01:39:32.000 --> 01:39:35.000]  And that's what's happening in Georgia where they're talking about potentially having
[01:39:35.000 --> 01:39:37.000]  state certification of media.
[01:39:37.000 --> 01:39:39.000]  What that ultimately is going to lead to is you're going to have people like
[01:39:39.000 --> 01:39:41.000]  Armand Boerz going to be sitting on those kind of boards.
[01:39:41.000 --> 01:39:44.000]  And by the way, the Republicans, as you've warned,
[01:39:44.000 --> 01:39:47.000]  instead of saying the censorship's wrong, they're going,
[01:39:47.000 --> 01:39:50.000]  oh, we'll beat you at your own game, so now everybody's going to lose their free speech.
[01:39:50.000 --> 01:39:52.000]  Absolutely. It's a sucker's bet.
[01:39:52.000 --> 01:39:56.000]  The moment you start wanting to suppress speech, you are in the wrong arena.
[01:39:56.000 --> 01:39:59.000]  So it doesn't matter whose speech it is, it doesn't matter how offensive it is,
[01:39:59.000 --> 01:40:02.000]  how bad it is, and the rest. The only thing that should be actionable
[01:40:02.000 --> 01:40:06.000]  is when someone makes a specific lie about a specific person that they know is a lie.
[01:40:06.000 --> 01:40:08.000]  That's always been out there.
[01:40:08.000 --> 01:40:12.000]  If you know somebody is in a murder, or you know somebody and putting cockroaches in their food,
[01:40:12.000 --> 01:40:15.000]  you're just a competing restaurant that's jealous, you did it for damage,
[01:40:15.000 --> 01:40:17.000]  you've damaged them, then you get in trouble.
[01:40:17.000 --> 01:40:19.000]  Precisely, but it should always be limited to that.
[01:40:19.000 --> 01:40:22.000]  That's common English common law and it makes perfect sense.
[01:40:22.000 --> 01:40:26.000]  It's eight centuries of law in one way, shape, or form going back to the United Kingdom.
[01:40:26.000 --> 01:40:31.000]  And if we change it at all, if we have EU standards, or we have Chinese standards,
[01:40:31.000 --> 01:40:34.000]  then we no longer have free speech, we no longer have free speech.
[01:40:34.000 --> 01:40:38.000]  Well, it's like medicine. 15 years ago globally, they got rid of the Hippocratic Oath of Hippocrates.
[01:40:38.000 --> 01:40:42.000]  Do no harm. And now a bioethics board decides if you're alive or if you're viable,
[01:40:42.000 --> 01:40:45.000]  and now, well, we think this baby might have a good future.
[01:40:45.000 --> 01:40:47.000]  We're going to kill it. By the way, we're going to harvest it first.
[01:40:47.000 --> 01:40:49.000]  Now a bioethics board is in control.
[01:40:49.000 --> 01:40:52.000]  So really, it's a new form of government.
[01:40:52.000 --> 01:40:55.000]  It's corporate usurpation of the people's common law.
[01:40:55.000 --> 01:40:58.000]  Absolutely. What's happening is they're trying to privatize the public square
[01:40:58.000 --> 01:41:01.000]  and monopolize that control of the public square,
[01:41:01.000 --> 01:41:05.000]  so that only the approved sanctioned speech will be allowed.
[01:41:05.000 --> 01:41:09.000]  It is literally Orwellian. It's like they read 1984 and thought,
[01:41:09.000 --> 01:41:11.000]  well, this would be a great script for the future.
[01:41:11.000 --> 01:41:14.000]  And then they misrepresent when you've done the numbers.
[01:41:14.000 --> 01:41:18.000]  400 hours of your people, you've looked at all the other law firms that went over stuff.
[01:41:18.000 --> 01:41:21.000]  We come back, we've got to get and play the Christian in the Amunpur,
[01:41:21.000 --> 01:41:24.000]  where she says arrest people that say Hillary is a criminal.
[01:41:24.000 --> 01:41:27.000]  But you've looked at it. We hardly ever even talked about Sandy Hook.
[01:41:27.000 --> 01:41:29.000]  Oh, precisely. It was less than one-one-hundredth of one percent,
[01:41:29.000 --> 01:41:31.000]  what I explained in court yesterday.
[01:41:31.000 --> 01:41:33.000]  It's a tiny percentage of the coverage.
[01:41:33.000 --> 01:41:36.000]  Most of the issues about Sandy Hook came from third parties, other people.
[01:41:36.000 --> 01:41:39.000]  Again, that's the media acting like it's me
[01:41:39.000 --> 01:41:43.000]  when they're the ones pimping the poor families out and won't shut up about it.
[01:41:43.000 --> 01:41:47.000]  Precisely. They continue to recycle the story over and over again,
[01:41:47.000 --> 01:41:49.000]  re-traumatizing people unnecessarily.
[01:41:49.000 --> 01:41:50.000]  In my name.
[01:41:50.000 --> 01:41:52.000]  Exactly, because that's the media's objective.
[01:41:52.000 --> 01:41:56.000]  I mean, they love trauma porn, and the media's addicted to it,
[01:41:56.000 --> 01:41:58.000]  and they've been covering it obsessively with it.
[01:41:58.000 --> 01:42:01.000]  And then MSM loves mass shootings, so now instead of getting in trouble for it,
[01:42:01.000 --> 01:42:03.000]  they go, oh, Alex Jones.
[01:42:03.000 --> 01:42:05.000]  Oh, precisely. The congressman that's going to run for president,
[01:42:05.000 --> 01:42:08.000]  he's going to announce from Parkland.
[01:42:08.000 --> 01:42:11.000]  So it's like, why continue to re-traumatize people over and over again?
[01:42:11.000 --> 01:42:12.000]  Deutsche.
[01:42:12.000 --> 01:42:13.000]  Yeah, the Saul Well.
[01:42:13.000 --> 01:42:14.000]  Saul Well.
[01:42:14.000 --> 01:42:15.000]  So he's going to go...
[01:42:15.000 --> 01:42:16.000]  A swallow as well.
[01:42:16.000 --> 01:42:17.000]  Yes, yes, yes. Him.
[01:42:17.000 --> 01:42:19.000]  The guy that says everybody's a Russian agent.
[01:42:19.000 --> 01:42:20.000]  That's correct.
[01:42:20.000 --> 01:42:22.000]  Tucker Carlson, I mean, a Russian agent.
[01:42:22.000 --> 01:42:27.000]  Precisely. I mean, he thinks any opposition to gun control is Russian-inspired.
[01:42:27.000 --> 01:42:29.000]  So, I mean, clearly, that's his mindset.
[01:42:29.000 --> 01:42:31.000]  Oh, yeah, that's the new thing I saw at the New York Times last year.
[01:42:31.000 --> 01:42:33.000]  It's a Russian conspiracy.
[01:42:33.000 --> 01:42:35.000]  The Second Amendment comes from the Russians.
[01:42:35.000 --> 01:42:37.000]  Exactly. The NRA and the Russians are all in bed together.
[01:42:37.000 --> 01:42:39.000]  I thought it came from George Washington.
[01:42:39.000 --> 01:42:40.000]  Yeah, precisely.
[01:42:40.000 --> 01:42:41.000]  Oh, he's a Russian too.
[01:42:41.000 --> 01:42:44.000]  Exactly. It came from the founders of the country who recognized that freedom
[01:42:44.000 --> 01:42:45.000]  was necessary for all freedoms.
[01:42:45.000 --> 01:42:48.000]  Come on. Barnes, are you saying I support George...
[01:42:48.000 --> 01:42:49.000]  George Washington's a Russian?
[01:42:49.000 --> 01:42:50.000]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:42:50.000 --> 01:42:51.000]  Correct. Exactly.
[01:42:51.000 --> 01:42:53.000]  All right. Barnes is bad.
[01:42:53.000 --> 01:42:55.000]  He's back in George Washington now.
[01:42:55.000 --> 01:43:21.000]  We'll see you next time.
[01:43:25.000 --> 01:43:27.000]  We can override the censors now.
[01:43:27.000 --> 01:43:30.000]  And if all of our audience gets involved with hashtag Alex Jones,
[01:43:30.000 --> 01:43:32.000]  we are unstoppable together.
[01:43:32.000 --> 01:43:36.000]  We've already changed the world together with our laser focus.
[01:43:36.000 --> 01:43:42.000]  Do it again with hashtag Alex Jones on Twitter, on Facebook, on Google, on YouTube, everywhere.
[01:43:42.000 --> 01:43:46.000]  Call and talk radio, c-span, shout it out loud and public, hashtag Alex Jones.
[01:43:46.000 --> 01:43:50.000]  That's the rallying cry to restore the First Amendment.
[01:43:50.000 --> 01:43:57.000]  Creativity and the dynamic human spirit that refuses to submit.

[01:46:37.000 --> 01:46:39.000]  weak emergency supplies.

[01:46:54.000 --> 01:47:12.000]  high-quality storeable foods powered by my Patreon supply.
[01:47:25.000 --> 01:47:28.000]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:47:28.000 --> 01:47:30.000]  I've got one question because you just said,
[01:47:30.000 --> 01:47:33.000]  lock her up, or lock me up.
[01:47:33.000 --> 01:47:37.000]  Of course, lock her up was a feature of the 2016 Trump campaign.
[01:47:37.000 --> 01:47:42.000]  Do you in retrospect wish that people like yourself,
[01:47:42.000 --> 01:47:45.000]  the head of the FBI, I mean the people in charge of law and order,
[01:47:45.000 --> 01:47:49.000]  had shut down that language, that it was dangerous potentially,
[01:47:49.000 --> 01:47:53.000]  that it could have created violence, that it's kind of hate speech?
[01:47:53.000 --> 01:47:56.000]  Should that have been allowed?
[01:47:56.000 --> 01:47:58.000]  That's not a role for government to play.
[01:47:58.000 --> 01:48:01.000]  The beauty of this country is people can say what they want,
[01:48:01.000 --> 01:48:04.000]  even if it's misleading and it's demagoguery.
[01:48:04.000 --> 01:48:07.000]  The people who should have shut it down were Republicans
[01:48:07.000 --> 01:48:12.000]  who understand the rule of law and the values that they claim to stand for.
[01:48:12.000 --> 01:48:15.000]  Shame on them, but it wasn't a role for government to play.
[01:48:15.000 --> 01:48:17.000]  All right, let me get into the first amendment part in a minute.
[01:48:17.000 --> 01:48:21.000]  But first, the Democrats are saying the Russians stole the election,
[01:48:21.000 --> 01:48:23.000]  arrest Trump, arrest his whole family.
[01:48:23.000 --> 01:48:27.000]  Meanwhile, we have Hillary with the servers, with the Russians, with the Chinese.
[01:48:27.000 --> 01:48:29.000]  We launched the whole lock her up movement.
[01:48:29.000 --> 01:48:30.000]  Our audience did.
[01:48:30.000 --> 01:48:34.000]  We launched the Bill Clinton's the rapist movement, because he settled those cases.
[01:48:34.000 --> 01:48:37.000]  We launched all these major areas.
[01:48:37.000 --> 01:48:40.000]  And then now Christina Amanpour, who helped launch the whole fake serve war,
[01:48:40.000 --> 01:48:43.000]  who's a war criminal, who supports all this stuff.
[01:48:43.000 --> 01:48:48.000]  She's up there straight-facing arrest people that say that Hillary's a criminal.
[01:48:48.000 --> 01:48:51.000]  That's so alien, that's so dangerous.
[01:48:51.000 --> 01:48:52.000]  And it's not just her doing it.
[01:48:52.000 --> 01:48:58.000]  They're all over the so-called news saying arrest our opposition.
[01:48:58.000 --> 01:49:01.000]  These people are flagrant authoritarians.
[01:49:01.000 --> 01:49:06.000]  What's astounding is she's saying that somebody saying lock her up is grounds to lock them up.
[01:49:06.000 --> 01:49:09.000]  You know, she's saying this is you should really never call her.
[01:49:09.000 --> 01:49:11.000]  On his face, it's oxymoronic.
[01:49:11.000 --> 01:49:12.000]  Absolutely.
[01:49:12.000 --> 01:49:14.000]  I mean, it's deeply ironic in multiple levels.
[01:49:14.000 --> 01:49:18.000]  And when even James Comey recognizes, oh, geez, that's really insane.
[01:49:18.000 --> 01:49:20.000]  Then you know how insane it is.
[01:49:20.000 --> 01:49:24.000]  Because here's a guy who had no problem violating a lot of people's constitutional rights and liberties.
[01:49:24.000 --> 01:49:25.000]  Harjuring himself?
[01:49:25.000 --> 01:49:26.000]  Oh, absolutely.
[01:49:26.000 --> 01:49:27.000]  Illegal FISA investigation.
[01:49:27.000 --> 01:49:28.000]  In the same forum.
[01:49:28.000 --> 01:49:30.000]  He goes and says, I never leaked anything.
[01:49:30.000 --> 01:49:32.000]  And two months later, well, I did six months ago.
[01:49:32.000 --> 01:49:33.000]  Oh, precisely.
[01:49:33.000 --> 01:49:34.000]  That's four months after.
[01:49:34.000 --> 01:49:36.000]  I mean, he kept a little diary of all the bad stuff he was doing,
[01:49:36.000 --> 01:49:39.000]  which is decided not the brightest criminal cop in the world.
[01:49:39.000 --> 01:49:47.000]  But the fact that he is like, no, there's no role for government to lock people up simply for their speech is a sign of how insane it is.
[01:49:47.000 --> 01:49:51.000]  And it shows how much he believed that this was completely okay.
[01:49:51.000 --> 01:49:55.000]  Like she's sitting there thinking, you agree with me as FBI director that you should have locked these people up.
[01:49:55.000 --> 01:49:58.000]  Because how else does the FBI shut down the opposition?
[01:49:58.000 --> 01:50:02.000]  This speech, the only way to do it is to lock people up is to do mass arrest.
[01:50:02.000 --> 01:50:09.000]  I mean, what she, what our report was saying is there, the FBI should have raided the Republican National Convention, picked everybody up and locked them all up in mass,
[01:50:09.000 --> 01:50:14.000]  because they were chanting lock her up about someone who actually had engaged in criminal conduct.
[01:50:14.000 --> 01:50:18.000]  Oh my God, a third of the people we're wearing are Hillary for prison shirt.
[01:50:18.000 --> 01:50:21.000]  Even seeing a report of that, you just crystallized it.
[01:50:21.000 --> 01:50:26.000]  She's calling for internment camps of a third of the Republicans.
[01:50:26.000 --> 01:50:27.000]  Precisely.
[01:50:27.000 --> 01:50:30.000]  I mean, it's so, it's so over the top.
[01:50:30.000 --> 01:50:34.000]  It was insane when I first read the headline, I was like, oh, that's probably, you know, exaggerated.
[01:50:34.000 --> 01:50:35.000]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:50:35.000 --> 01:50:36.000]  Me too.
[01:50:36.000 --> 01:50:38.000]  Three days ago, I'm like, that's not real.
[01:50:38.000 --> 01:50:39.000]  I click it.
[01:50:39.000 --> 01:50:40.000]  She says it.
[01:50:40.000 --> 01:50:41.000]  It's even worse.
[01:50:41.000 --> 01:50:43.000]  I mean, the headline can't even capture what's the full scope of what she's saying.
[01:50:43.000 --> 01:50:45.000]  She's saying arrest everyone that says Hillary's a criminal.
[01:50:45.000 --> 01:50:46.000]  Exactly.
[01:50:46.000 --> 01:50:47.000]  There's only one way.
[01:50:47.000 --> 01:50:48.000]  She's saying imprison people for speech.
[01:50:48.000 --> 01:50:49.000]  Precisely.
[01:50:49.000 --> 01:50:51.000]  There's only one way the FBI can shut something down.
[01:50:51.000 --> 01:50:55.000]  The FBI, she's not asking like the FCC community, communications director.
[01:50:55.000 --> 01:51:03.000]  She's asking the FBI director why the FBI didn't shut it down and the only way the FBI could do that is do stuff that even Hoover wasn't willing to do.
[01:51:03.000 --> 01:51:05.000]  So let's shift gears and ask this question.
[01:51:05.000 --> 01:51:07.000]  Back to what they're doing with me.
[01:51:07.000 --> 01:51:10.000]  We now know they know they're never going to win jury trials.
[01:51:10.000 --> 01:51:11.000]  They're never going to get this.
[01:51:11.000 --> 01:51:15.000]  They think in process, we now know people have been approached counsel.
[01:51:15.000 --> 01:51:19.000]  The left really believes I'm funded by the mercers and the Russians.
[01:51:19.000 --> 01:51:21.000]  They're telling counsel, your client's going to get arrested.
[01:51:21.000 --> 01:51:22.000]  It's all coming out.
[01:51:22.000 --> 01:51:23.000]  You're going to get arrested.
[01:51:23.000 --> 01:51:25.000]  They're terrorizing people.
[01:51:25.000 --> 01:51:27.000]  They're lying.
[01:51:27.000 --> 01:51:28.000]  No Mercer money.
[01:51:28.000 --> 01:51:29.000]  No Russian money.
[01:51:29.000 --> 01:51:31.000]  I mean, I am a flaming American.
[01:51:31.000 --> 01:51:32.000]  Okay.
[01:51:32.000 --> 01:51:35.000]  I mean, it's like, it's just insane.
[01:51:35.000 --> 01:51:39.000]  I've already been and like, I have all these audits and everything done by different law firms.
[01:51:39.000 --> 01:51:40.000]  There's nothing here.
[01:51:40.000 --> 01:51:41.000]  Like, well, we know it's here.
[01:51:41.000 --> 01:51:43.000]  Give us the email.
[01:51:43.000 --> 01:51:44.000]  Give us the stuff.
[01:51:44.000 --> 01:51:46.000]  And I'm like, it's all on air.
[01:51:46.000 --> 01:51:50.000]  And I even tell crew when they're talking in the halls about news, I go say it on air.
[01:51:50.000 --> 01:51:51.000]  Oh, absolutely.
[01:51:51.000 --> 01:51:52.000]  You know what I do?
[01:51:52.000 --> 01:51:57.000]  When I'm not talking here, I'm eating or I'm crapping on the damn pot in there, man.
[01:51:57.000 --> 01:51:58.000]  I'm going to be gross.
[01:51:58.000 --> 01:51:59.000]  This is war.
[01:51:59.000 --> 01:52:03.000]  We say they don't get the power of it's all out on my sleeve.
[01:52:03.000 --> 01:52:05.000]  They don't get it's all there, man.
[01:52:05.000 --> 01:52:06.000]  It's Texas.
[01:52:06.000 --> 01:52:07.000]  Great shooting.
[01:52:07.000 --> 01:52:08.000]  You want to explain it to them?
[01:52:08.000 --> 01:52:09.000]  Oh, sure.
[01:52:09.000 --> 01:52:12.000]  So I mean, what you have is a lot of press and politicians who are spreading a lot of fake
[01:52:12.000 --> 01:52:17.000]  news and false information in order to create this sort of the caricature version of you that
[01:52:17.000 --> 01:52:20.000]  was on homeland and try to get people to believe that's the real version.
[01:52:20.000 --> 01:52:22.000]  It's completely fake and at some level.
[01:52:22.000 --> 01:52:25.000]  You first said that when I met you months ago, we just had you on about the Covington kids.
[01:52:25.000 --> 01:52:26.000]  And I'm like, yeah, some of them.
[01:52:26.000 --> 01:52:31.000]  But I realized they literally are like, I think I'm a supervillain and now like leftist women
[01:52:31.000 --> 01:52:34.000]  like throw themselves at me and like, oh my God, you're just a super genius.
[01:52:34.000 --> 01:52:36.000]  I mean, it's like, no, I'm not.
[01:52:36.000 --> 01:52:37.000]  I just want freedom.
[01:52:37.000 --> 01:52:38.000]  Precisely.
[01:52:38.000 --> 01:52:39.000]  Just a straight shooter, always been a straight shooter.
[01:52:39.000 --> 01:52:41.000]  Anybody who knows you know that knows that.
[01:52:41.000 --> 01:52:46.000]  And in fact, the politicians in the press that are spreading this, they've talked to
[01:52:46.000 --> 01:52:47.000]  ex-employees.
[01:52:47.000 --> 01:52:48.000]  They know other people.
[01:52:48.000 --> 01:52:49.000]  They know the whole story.
[01:52:49.000 --> 01:52:52.000]  So they know these, these rumors are crazy that they're insane.
[01:52:52.000 --> 01:52:53.000]  They're inane.
[01:52:53.000 --> 01:52:54.000]  They're the same.
[01:52:54.000 --> 01:52:56.000]  It's they're just trying to rush a collusion, delusion.
[01:52:56.000 --> 01:52:57.000]  They tried on Trump.
[01:52:57.000 --> 01:53:00.000]  The press and the politicians are trying to do the same thing to you.
[01:53:00.000 --> 01:53:01.000]  So it's the same thing.
[01:53:01.000 --> 01:53:05.000]  I mean, I have an email for nannies and for documents.
[01:53:05.000 --> 01:53:06.000]  It's my private email.
[01:53:06.000 --> 01:53:09.000]  I don't, I've never emailed some of myself.
[01:53:09.000 --> 01:53:10.000]  I'll do a voice memo.
[01:53:10.000 --> 01:53:12.000]  Hey, your ex-wife's asking about this.
[01:53:12.000 --> 01:53:14.000]  Okay, I do a voice memo sentence to the assistant.
[01:53:14.000 --> 01:53:15.000]  Exactly.
[01:53:15.000 --> 01:53:16.000]  That's it.
[01:53:16.000 --> 01:53:18.000]  Just like Trump, he doesn't have an email.
[01:53:18.000 --> 01:53:22.000]  I almost anybody in your line of work would honestly be insane to have it in a publicly
[01:53:22.000 --> 01:53:26.000]  available email address because the function of it is you would get bombarded with millions
[01:53:26.000 --> 01:53:27.000]  and millions of emails.
[01:53:27.000 --> 01:53:31.000]  You people who need to reach you wouldn't be able to reach you because you'd be spammed
[01:53:31.000 --> 01:53:32.000]  so heavily.
[01:53:32.000 --> 01:53:33.000]  People you need to read.
[01:53:33.000 --> 01:53:36.000]  I got rid of my email like 12 years ago and it was getting 10,000 a day.
[01:53:36.000 --> 01:53:37.000]  Oh, precisely.
[01:53:37.000 --> 01:53:40.000]  I mean, just, I mean, in four words alone gets over a million a year.
[01:53:40.000 --> 01:53:44.000]  So the, the nature of the function of it, that made it impossible and impractical.
[01:53:44.000 --> 01:53:47.000]  And fundamentally, the politicians in the press that are trying to push these various
[01:53:47.000 --> 01:53:52.000]  fake stories out through their various aspects and avenues are, no, it can't be true.
[01:53:52.000 --> 01:53:54.000]  So it's just the nature of it.
[01:53:54.000 --> 01:53:58.000]  In fact, the court recognized that yesterday that that's the nature of most talk radio
[01:53:58.000 --> 01:53:59.000]  businesses.
[01:53:59.000 --> 01:54:01.000]  They're not email driven businesses.
[01:54:01.000 --> 01:54:02.000]  They're verbal driven businesses.
[01:54:02.000 --> 01:54:04.000]  That's the way a lot of people are.
[01:54:04.000 --> 01:54:06.000]  Everybody's like, hey, look at this video clip.
[01:54:06.000 --> 01:54:07.000]  Look at this article.
[01:54:07.000 --> 01:54:11.000]  Hey, and again, I just don't, I communicate via text message and over the phone.
[01:54:11.000 --> 01:54:14.000]  So I found things, people understand stuff in email or even text.
[01:54:14.000 --> 01:54:18.000]  It's, I told the crew, stop calling guests on text messages.
[01:54:18.000 --> 01:54:19.000]  They ignore you.
[01:54:19.000 --> 01:54:20.000]  Call them physically.
[01:54:20.000 --> 01:54:21.000]  Use the damn telephone.
[01:54:21.000 --> 01:54:22.000]  Exactly.
[01:54:22.000 --> 01:54:23.000]  It's old school.
[01:54:23.000 --> 01:54:28.000]  And they say in here, there's no way Jones isn't directing his business via email.
[01:54:28.000 --> 01:54:29.000]  Bull crap.
[01:54:29.000 --> 01:54:30.000]  Precisely.
[01:54:30.000 --> 01:54:32.000]  I am not going to produce fake stuff for you.
[01:54:32.000 --> 01:54:35.000]  And then we give them a bunch of stuff as the judge demands it.
[01:54:35.000 --> 01:54:37.000]  They then say, oh, this is too broad.
[01:54:37.000 --> 01:54:40.000]  The, yeah, you get different kinds of complaints at different times.
[01:54:40.000 --> 01:54:44.000]  I think ultimately and fundamentally the court recognized that there's been no effort to
[01:54:44.000 --> 01:54:45.000]  disguise anything.
[01:54:45.000 --> 01:54:48.000]  This is one of the most open and transparent networks in the world compared to any other
[01:54:48.000 --> 01:54:50.000]  media network that exists.
[01:54:50.000 --> 01:54:52.000]  It's direct from my brain to the listener.
[01:54:52.000 --> 01:54:53.000]  There's no filters.
[01:54:53.000 --> 01:54:54.000]  Precisely.
[01:54:54.000 --> 01:54:57.000]  What's kept private and secret is anybody who wants to be kept private and secret is
[01:54:57.000 --> 01:55:01.000]  a whistleblower and anybody who's a customer and anybody who's a supporter, their privacy
[01:55:01.000 --> 01:55:02.000]  always be presented.
[01:55:02.000 --> 01:55:03.000]  That took months to go through.
[01:55:03.000 --> 01:55:04.000]  Absolutely.
[01:55:04.000 --> 01:55:05.000]  Of course.
[01:55:05.000 --> 01:55:08.000]  And that's why the, but now the issues are back to the core issue of the first amendment
[01:55:08.000 --> 01:55:09.440]  free press and free speech.
[01:55:09.440 --> 01:55:12.880]  Though we have free press and free speech in this country, this case will dictate and
[01:55:12.880 --> 01:55:13.880]  determine that future.
[01:55:13.880 --> 01:55:14.880]  And I want to be clear.
[01:55:14.880 --> 01:55:19.520]  In defamation lawsuit, lawyers for Sandy Hook families accused Jones of more stonewalling.
[01:55:19.520 --> 01:55:23.880]  And they say in here, there's no way he doesn't have an email and there's no way he's not
[01:55:23.880 --> 01:55:25.040]  talking about Sandy Hook.
[01:55:25.040 --> 01:55:28.960]  I'm only talking about it now because you guys have done this.
[01:55:28.960 --> 01:55:32.320]  Don't believe these lawyers, he did not believe their own delusion, but like you said, they
[01:55:32.320 --> 01:55:34.120]  know full damn well.
[01:55:34.120 --> 01:55:35.880]  They know I don't have a company email.
[01:55:35.880 --> 01:55:40.160]  The Connecticut lawyers, at least should know better, and there's clearly the Connecticut
[01:55:40.160 --> 01:55:44.280]  lawyers have been overt about various political times that they have in other parts of it.
[01:55:44.280 --> 01:55:49.480]  So the, the fact that you have and clearly Senator Murphy and the politicians in the
[01:55:49.480 --> 01:55:54.000]  press are misusing this case, Murphy said, take Jones off the air to save American democracy.
[01:55:54.000 --> 01:55:55.000]  Close quote.
[01:55:55.000 --> 01:55:56.000]  Exactly.
[01:55:56.000 --> 01:55:58.040]  The politicians in the press are misusing and abusing this case.
[01:55:58.040 --> 01:56:01.960]  Why don't Americans look at that like Christina, I'm on poor and she says arrest people to
[01:56:01.960 --> 01:56:02.960]  criticize Hillary.
[01:56:02.960 --> 01:56:04.920]  And he says, take me off air.
[01:56:04.920 --> 01:56:06.920]  People should say that's a dangerous person.
[01:56:06.920 --> 01:56:11.480]  This guy, Hitler, everybody always over uses Hitler, but you know, Hitler took people
[01:56:11.480 --> 01:56:12.480]  off air.
[01:56:12.480 --> 01:56:15.600]  You haven't seen, that's what I was telling the members of the press earlier.
[01:56:15.600 --> 01:56:20.520]  We haven't seen public calls to completely censor and suppress speech like this since
[01:56:20.520 --> 01:56:23.480]  the Soviet era and the fascist era.
[01:56:23.480 --> 01:56:27.640]  And to have a United States Senator, like Senator Murphy, suggest that should be the
[01:56:27.640 --> 01:56:33.160]  remedy that we suppress and censor speech entirely of an entire individual and entire
[01:56:33.160 --> 01:56:39.280]  network, because he didn't like speech in the past is deeply offensive and deeply dangerous.
[01:56:39.280 --> 01:56:42.200]  Well, it shows where they're going, the collapse of the country, a total takeover.
[01:56:42.200 --> 01:56:44.840]  We're going to shift gears into other big issues you want to cover.
[01:56:44.840 --> 01:56:46.800]  I want to cover calls, video clips.

[02:00:29.600 --> 02:00:33.200]  Great crew in there doing an amazing job for live television and radio.
[02:00:33.200 --> 02:00:35.120]  They're better than my crew.
[02:00:35.120 --> 02:00:36.120]  Wonderful people.
[02:00:36.120 --> 02:00:37.120]  Thank you for them.
[02:00:37.120 --> 02:00:40.000]  Alright, I'm going to finish up on my topics and then we'll get into all the geopolitical
[02:00:40.000 --> 02:00:41.360]  things and a bunch of clips.
[02:00:41.360 --> 02:00:44.360]  Robert Barnes, really smart guy, not just a lawyer.
[02:00:44.360 --> 02:00:48.360]  You're here and the media tries to spin everything we do.
[02:00:48.360 --> 02:00:52.720]  I just go back to this.
[02:00:52.720 --> 02:00:57.160]  Do you think the Connecticut lawyers and the Texas lawyers really believe I'm secretly
[02:00:57.160 --> 02:01:03.040]  funded by the Mercers and the Russians, or are they just telling people that?
[02:01:03.040 --> 02:01:05.320]  From the Texas lawyers, we haven't heard any of those kind of claims.
[02:01:05.320 --> 02:01:09.720]  It's apparently coming from politicians in press connected to the Connecticut case.
[02:01:09.720 --> 02:01:11.720]  You have senators.
[02:01:11.720 --> 02:01:12.720]  Exactly.
[02:01:12.720 --> 02:01:13.720]  Or adjuncts.
[02:01:13.720 --> 02:01:14.720]  Exactly.
[02:01:14.720 --> 02:01:18.120]  So different political members and press members are pursuing crazy different theories
[02:01:18.120 --> 02:01:22.360]  that are clearly incorrect and that are clearly untrue that they must or should know are
[02:01:22.360 --> 02:01:23.840]  completely untrue.
[02:01:23.840 --> 02:01:27.200]  There's never been any effort, as I explained to the court yesterday, to in any way hide
[02:01:27.200 --> 02:01:28.200]  any information.
[02:01:28.200 --> 02:01:32.600]  There's been massive production here of anything that could be possibly pertinent or relevant.
[02:01:32.600 --> 02:01:37.280]  And in fact, that's why the court didn't issue any sanctions of any kind yesterday.
[02:01:37.280 --> 02:01:41.080]  So we're back to where the case should be in Texas, and hopefully it will be that way
[02:01:41.080 --> 02:01:44.920]  in Connecticut soon enough, where we focus on the core legal theories and legal issues
[02:01:44.920 --> 02:01:46.680]  that are implicated here.
[02:01:46.680 --> 02:01:49.880]  Because this is about the First Amendment freedom for everybody.
[02:01:49.880 --> 02:01:52.480]  And is there a zone of danger where you're not allowed to speak?
[02:01:52.480 --> 02:01:54.880]  They brought that up, because it's not firing a theater.
[02:01:54.880 --> 02:01:57.280]  It's this new thing of like, well, it's a group you could hurt.
[02:01:57.280 --> 02:02:01.520]  And as you said, if I said many gay people, I'm not against gays in general, but many
[02:02:01.520 --> 02:02:04.480]  of them have pedophilia, just like some heterosexuals have that.
[02:02:04.480 --> 02:02:09.520]  They're using the LGBT movement on kids as a way for pedophiles to get access to kids.
[02:02:09.520 --> 02:02:10.520]  That's been confirmed.
[02:02:10.520 --> 02:02:13.840]  Well, then do all the gay people sue me because they say I made them feel bad.
[02:02:13.840 --> 02:02:14.960]  Oh, precisely.
[02:02:14.960 --> 02:02:19.520]  Or if you raise questions about things like the incubator baby story, can people sue
[02:02:19.520 --> 02:02:20.520]  for that?
[02:02:20.520 --> 02:02:24.720]  Can people sue who support or oppose a war, who feel upset or offended by any kind of
[02:02:24.720 --> 02:02:26.840]  coverage that takes place related to it?
[02:02:26.840 --> 02:02:32.600]  So the scope of it is frightening, because if we have basically what the issue is, is
[02:02:32.600 --> 02:02:37.820]  are there constitutionally sacrosanct safe spaces that the First Amendment does not allow
[02:02:37.820 --> 02:02:40.960]  you to speak or express yourself, even if you remember the press?
[02:02:40.960 --> 02:02:44.920]  And do you think the judge, I don't think the judge is a bad person, but I think a lot
[02:02:44.920 --> 02:02:47.680]  of mainline liberals just are manipulated.
[02:02:47.680 --> 02:02:52.360]  Does he get in Texas how they're being hoodwinked, hoodwinked into bringing stuff forward that
[02:02:52.360 --> 02:02:54.120]  would never be brought forward?
[02:02:54.120 --> 02:02:57.880]  That media campaign saying, I'm saying things I didn't say, they're the ones saying it,
[02:02:57.880 --> 02:03:00.440]  and they say I'm saying it, so get rid of the First Amendment.
[02:03:00.440 --> 02:03:05.880]  It's completely villainous and transparent, not by the wonderful families and people.
[02:03:05.880 --> 02:03:06.880]  I really feel sorry for them.
[02:03:06.880 --> 02:03:08.680]  I'm talking about the people exploiting them.
[02:03:08.680 --> 02:03:12.360]  Yeah, all the politicians in the press that are misusing and abusing this for their own
[02:03:12.360 --> 02:03:15.120]  personal, political, and partisan agendas.
[02:03:15.120 --> 02:03:18.640]  As the court said yesterday, he recognized the very unique legal issue and a very significant
[02:03:18.640 --> 02:03:20.640]  and consequential legal issue.
[02:03:20.640 --> 02:03:24.080]  His decision in this case will likely become famous one way or the other.
[02:03:24.080 --> 02:03:26.600]  It's likely to go up to the United States Supreme Court.
[02:03:26.600 --> 02:03:29.400]  This case is going to determine the scope of the freedom of press and the freedom of
[02:03:29.400 --> 02:03:31.440]  speech in America for the future for everybody.
[02:03:31.440 --> 02:03:37.400]  Yeah, instead of New York Town versus Sullivan increasing the First Amendment, this will
[02:03:37.400 --> 02:03:39.880]  be Jenkins versus Jones or whatever.
[02:03:39.880 --> 02:03:43.840]  Yeah, whatever name of the parties are, basically the foundation-
[02:03:43.840 --> 02:03:45.160]  Well, we're not going to say her name.
[02:03:45.160 --> 02:03:46.160]  Exactly.
[02:03:46.160 --> 02:03:47.160]  I've never said her name.
[02:03:47.160 --> 02:03:50.400]  And they just are very upset about that, but they keep saying her name.
[02:03:50.400 --> 02:03:51.400]  Exactly.
[02:03:51.400 --> 02:03:55.880]  This is about the foundational First Amendment case, rather than having the New York Times
[02:03:55.880 --> 02:03:58.960]  in it, because nobody remembers Sullivan, they just remember New York Times, it's going
[02:03:58.960 --> 02:03:59.960]  to be Jones.
[02:03:59.960 --> 02:04:02.720]  It's going to be Jones and Info Wars is going to shape the future of the First Amendment
[02:04:02.720 --> 02:04:03.720]  in this country.
[02:04:03.720 --> 02:04:05.880]  And do we truly have free press?
[02:04:05.880 --> 02:04:07.440]  Do we truly have free speech?
[02:04:07.440 --> 02:04:10.400]  I don't say this as a thing to get at the enemy.
[02:04:10.400 --> 02:04:12.240]  I don't play games.
[02:04:12.240 --> 02:04:14.240]  They've really been off more than they can chew.
[02:04:14.240 --> 02:04:18.840]  I don't see any of these people trying to exploit these poor families.
[02:04:18.840 --> 02:04:21.240]  I don't see any of them down the road having success.
[02:04:21.240 --> 02:04:24.880]  I don't think the politicians in the press that have pushed this agenda and made it partisan,
[02:04:24.880 --> 02:04:27.080]  made it public, used it for deep platforming.
[02:04:27.080 --> 02:04:30.080]  It'll be just like Russiagate, Covington Kids, Kavanaugh.
[02:04:30.080 --> 02:04:31.080]  It's going to go flat.
[02:04:31.080 --> 02:04:33.960]  Well, ultimately, it's just like the New York Times case.
[02:04:33.960 --> 02:04:37.080]  The New York Times case ultimately set an important precedent.
[02:04:37.080 --> 02:04:41.200]  This will set an important protective precedent for all of the press and all of the speech
[02:04:41.200 --> 02:04:42.200]  for all of America.
[02:04:42.200 --> 02:04:44.240]  So this will be the New York Times versus Sullivan.
[02:04:44.240 --> 02:04:45.240]  Exactly.
[02:04:45.240 --> 02:04:47.440]  It'll be Sandy Hook lawyers versus Jones.
[02:04:47.440 --> 02:04:48.440]  That's who it is.
[02:04:48.440 --> 02:04:51.000]  It's just a Democratic Party versus Alex Jones versus America.
[02:04:51.000 --> 02:04:58.760]  I've got some really good news, though.
[02:04:58.760 --> 02:05:00.080]  X2 is back.
[02:05:00.080 --> 02:05:06.960]  The original X2, deep breath crystal, pure atomic iodine, what you want, infowarstore.com.
[02:05:06.960 --> 02:05:11.720]  It'll be here in a week, manufactured in the US, infowarstore.com with the best iodine
[02:05:11.720 --> 02:05:12.720]  in the world.
[02:05:12.720 --> 02:05:13.720]  X2, it's available.
[02:05:13.720 --> 02:05:14.840]  I thought X3 is great.
[02:05:14.840 --> 02:05:18.720]  We still got another deep breath crystal source, but I thought add the other two types of iodine
[02:05:18.720 --> 02:05:23.320]  that scientists that do that, it sold a lot that people want original X2.
[02:05:23.320 --> 02:05:26.960]  I was resigned the fact we didn't have X2, but it came through about a month ago.
[02:05:26.960 --> 02:05:31.320]  We now have X2 again at infowarstore.com, so hallelujah.
[02:05:31.320 --> 02:05:36.320]  It's been sold out for about almost three months, but we have now had the same company,
[02:05:36.320 --> 02:05:43.000]  the original X2, develop it again, and we were able to do the exact same formula.
[02:05:43.000 --> 02:05:48.040]  We want to pre-order X2, the ultimate iodine out there, learn about the iodine conspiracy,
[02:05:48.040 --> 02:05:51.120]  learn about IQ's dropping when you don't have it, learn about how the other iodines
[02:05:51.120 --> 02:06:18.240]  are bound, get yours today at infowarstore.com or infowarslife.com.
[02:06:18.240 --> 02:06:28.000]  The globalists on average are sociopaths, their minions are idiots.
[02:06:28.000 --> 02:06:31.460]  They know we have conscience, they know we have moral compass, so they're always trying
[02:06:31.460 --> 02:06:36.120]  to manipulate that compass, and even when we know they're manipulating it, we still defend
[02:06:36.120 --> 02:06:37.120]  ourselves.
[02:06:37.120 --> 02:06:42.200]  No, they're the ones that can't handle scrutiny, and that's why they're bullies.
[02:06:42.200 --> 02:06:45.160]  You know, the average liberal I knew growing up, I liked.
[02:06:45.160 --> 02:06:48.840]  I wouldn't call myself a conservative, I wouldn't even call myself a liberal.
[02:06:48.840 --> 02:06:50.880]  I was just an Americana libertarian.
[02:06:50.880 --> 02:06:57.280]  Bob, you can define yourself if you like, but just Americana, renaissance, common sense.
[02:06:57.280 --> 02:07:00.360]  But then something happened once Obama got in.
[02:07:00.360 --> 02:07:06.520]  The left now is, the liberals are pro-or, in Gallup poll, more than Republicans.
[02:07:06.520 --> 02:07:11.040]  They don't care, they just want a piece of the pie, they're like bandits, and they think
[02:07:11.040 --> 02:07:15.680]  they get it through government extraction, and these promises like this magic lottery
[02:07:15.680 --> 02:07:17.180]  ticket in the sky.
[02:07:17.180 --> 02:07:21.440]  So it's like a gambling casino where no one's ever succeeded in the general public in socialism
[02:07:21.440 --> 02:07:22.440]  or communism.
[02:07:22.440 --> 02:07:27.280]  It's not like 60-40 at a casino, or 55-45 Blackjack or whatever.
[02:07:27.280 --> 02:07:31.840]  They're just gambling on something that is completely rigged, unless you're an insider.
[02:07:31.840 --> 02:07:35.600]  They can't admit they've been conned, getting two or three degrees that are worthless.
[02:07:35.600 --> 02:07:40.840]  So they double down and say, no, I want socialism, I want communism, now it's going to deliver
[02:07:40.840 --> 02:07:43.000]  the plan I want.
[02:07:43.000 --> 02:07:48.120]  We have this video from Paula Alto, where this Trump supporter, who's Jewish, is a polite
[02:07:48.120 --> 02:07:52.800]  old man, woman who harassed old men in Starbucks over a mega hat, gets fired.
[02:07:52.800 --> 02:07:56.360]  She says, I'm going to get you fired, I'm going to take people to your house, I'm going
[02:07:56.360 --> 02:07:58.280]  to destroy your life.
[02:07:58.280 --> 02:08:03.240]  She tries to rally everyone to attack him, so she wants to be a leader.
[02:08:03.240 --> 02:08:07.880]  They all turned against her, because they saw, and now they're suddenly having a debate
[02:08:07.880 --> 02:08:11.000]  in the town going, well, you are allowed to wear a hat.
[02:08:11.000 --> 02:08:15.960]  This is still America, and so more and more people are wearing the red hats, they're wearing
[02:08:15.960 --> 02:08:20.320]  informal shirts, it's the same thing, and they're shooting videos showing it, and it's
[02:08:20.320 --> 02:08:21.320]  backfiring.
[02:08:21.320 --> 02:08:22.320]  Here's an example.
[02:08:22.320 --> 02:08:25.240]  I got a cost of a week and a half ago at Lucy's Fried Chicken with my wife, it became
[02:08:25.240 --> 02:08:28.680]  a big national news story, something like 10 million views on Reddit or something.
[02:08:28.680 --> 02:08:29.680]  It was insane.
[02:08:29.680 --> 02:08:33.680]  When I went to the veto thing last Saturday, the Saturday after, everybody was screaming,
[02:08:33.680 --> 02:08:37.160]  oh, you got kicked out, oh, it's all about ostracizing, no, I didn't get kicked out.
[02:08:37.160 --> 02:08:40.960]  I was leaving, they'd already accosted my table three times, they were blocking my
[02:08:40.960 --> 02:08:47.280]  way out, and the place talked to the statesman and said, no, Alex was accosted, they called
[02:08:47.280 --> 02:08:52.880]  the office and said, please, people are mad at us, we didn't kick Alex out, he was already
[02:08:52.880 --> 02:08:56.800]  leaving, we kicked them out after and told them they're banned from life.
[02:08:56.800 --> 02:09:02.200]  So the truth is, they came in a free society, in a proud business, they accosted me, they
[02:09:02.200 --> 02:09:06.640]  got thrown out after I left, but the rest of the media, other than the statesman, they're
[02:09:06.640 --> 02:09:12.240]  going to fire this still love guy, still believe I just started screaming at some innocent
[02:09:12.240 --> 02:09:16.440]  table, but that's only in the weird left, so they believe they're bull anymore.
[02:09:16.440 --> 02:09:19.800]  Precisely, they're projecting onto others what they themselves are routinely and regularly
[02:09:19.800 --> 02:09:24.560]  doing, they're using ostracism, socially, politically, economically, culturally, that's
[02:09:24.560 --> 02:09:29.920]  what unites a lot of these cases and incidents, whether it's the attempts to ban advertising
[02:09:29.920 --> 02:09:34.360]  for Tucker Carlson, whether it's the attempts to run out an older Jewish man from Starbucks
[02:09:34.360 --> 02:09:38.640]  and yell at him for having a MAGA hat on, whether it's attempts to physically assault
[02:09:38.640 --> 02:09:44.040]  people as happened outside of various of the social, political, I got slapped and hit probably
[02:09:44.040 --> 02:09:45.040]  15 times.
[02:09:45.040 --> 02:09:48.240]  The security kept it back, but it was, what do you do when a woman runs through security
[02:09:48.240 --> 02:09:49.240]  and slaps you?
[02:09:49.240 --> 02:09:52.880]  You know, I mean, my security kept him away, but they were nicer to women, which I agreed
[02:09:52.880 --> 02:09:53.880]  with.
[02:09:53.880 --> 02:09:55.160]  Yeah, but I mean, I had people attacking me.
[02:09:55.160 --> 02:09:56.160]  Oh, correct.
[02:09:56.160 --> 02:09:59.400]  It's been happening routinely and repeatedly across a wide range of political spectrum,
[02:09:59.400 --> 02:10:02.760]  and it's happening by the left against anybody on the right because they're much more statist.
[02:10:02.760 --> 02:10:06.200]  In other words, it's much more, you're seeing the recandescence of the 1920s where you saw
[02:10:06.200 --> 02:10:10.760]  street violence where both the fascists and the communists used it to gain and seize power.
[02:10:10.760 --> 02:10:14.000]  They usually were fighting each other sometimes in the street, but either way, they were both
[02:10:14.000 --> 02:10:15.000]  using street violence.
[02:10:15.000 --> 02:10:17.560]  And why is the left evolving to that playbook?
[02:10:17.560 --> 02:10:19.680]  It's because, I mean, there's various theories.
[02:10:19.680 --> 02:10:23.080]  Professor Haight has an interpretation that basically our safe space culture that kids
[02:10:23.080 --> 02:10:27.600]  grew up in in the 90s during the kidnappings, sort of panic, moral panic that took place
[02:10:27.600 --> 02:10:32.680]  during that timeframe has led people, has a new generation of the left, the young left
[02:10:32.680 --> 02:10:36.240]  disproportionately, believes that you shouldn't have free speech, that you shouldn't have
[02:10:36.240 --> 02:10:38.680]  free press, that you shouldn't have freedom.
[02:10:38.680 --> 02:10:40.120]  They grew up in those bubbles.
[02:10:40.120 --> 02:10:41.120]  Absolutely.
[02:10:41.120 --> 02:10:45.400]  I remember growing up in Rockwall, a suburb of Dallas, and there was like 300 acres of
[02:10:45.400 --> 02:10:49.120]  farmland that nobody used that later turned into a shopping mall.
[02:10:49.120 --> 02:10:52.560]  And I remember like routinely in the summer, whenever I would just tell, hey, me and the
[02:10:52.560 --> 02:10:58.720]  neighbor kids, we're going to build a by the railroad track, a tent, and we're gonna go
[02:10:58.720 --> 02:11:03.760]  stay there, and we had like 22 rifles, they're on the state property shooting bottles and
[02:11:03.760 --> 02:11:09.960]  stuff and building fires and like cooking hamburgers, you know, when I was like 10 years
[02:11:09.960 --> 02:11:14.120]  old, that was completely normal when my parents were kids, but nowadays that would just be
[02:11:14.120 --> 02:11:15.120]  insane.
[02:11:15.120 --> 02:11:16.120]  Exactly.
[02:11:16.120 --> 02:11:22.000]  The free play among strangers led to a belief in interaction and discourse in a wider range
[02:11:22.000 --> 02:11:23.000]  of people.
[02:11:23.000 --> 02:11:24.440]  And you weren't afraid of freedom.
[02:11:24.440 --> 02:11:25.720]  You weren't afraid of freedom to act.
[02:11:25.720 --> 02:11:30.320]  Also, sitting out there under the stars, cooking hamburgers, you know, in the woods
[02:11:30.320 --> 02:11:34.520]  by a railroad track, squatting right next to somebody's property, that opens up the
[02:11:34.520 --> 02:11:38.600]  archetypal memories and everything and then makes you step into all that.
[02:11:38.600 --> 02:11:39.600]  Exactly.
[02:11:39.600 --> 02:11:40.600]  You reconnect the nature.
[02:11:40.600 --> 02:11:42.720]  You reconnect to the universality of humanity.
[02:11:42.720 --> 02:11:46.560]  You're not stuck in a tiny little bubble of the same thinking and the same attitudes
[02:11:46.560 --> 02:11:47.560]  and the same...
[02:11:47.560 --> 02:11:49.760]  And you're not scared of the archetypal Hollywood monsters.
[02:11:49.760 --> 02:11:51.920]  Like a lot of kids are scared of monsters that never get by.
[02:11:51.920 --> 02:11:55.000]  We had shotguns and 22s at 10 years old.
[02:11:55.000 --> 02:11:56.000]  And nobody shot themselves.
[02:11:56.000 --> 02:11:57.000]  We were...
[02:11:57.000 --> 02:11:58.000]  Precisely.
[02:11:58.000 --> 02:12:01.260]  You didn't have this sort of celebration of sociopathic violence that Hollywood culture
[02:12:01.260 --> 02:12:06.560]  has helped create and foster and fester and helped make it more of a reality because increasingly
[02:12:06.560 --> 02:12:10.600]  what we have is a whole generation of people who have grown up in the alternative virtual
[02:12:10.600 --> 02:12:11.600]  reality.
[02:12:11.600 --> 02:12:12.600]  They haven't grown up playing on the street.
[02:12:12.600 --> 02:12:14.200]  They haven't grown out going out to the park.
[02:12:14.200 --> 02:12:16.400]  They haven't grown up interacting with strangers.
[02:12:16.400 --> 02:12:20.840]  Instead, they've interacted solely on social media and in their controlled cabin spaces.
[02:12:20.840 --> 02:12:24.040]  And then because they've been so protected, like they've noticed grass that doesn't have
[02:12:24.040 --> 02:12:28.680]  any gravity or that doesn't have any wind tends to die and be sickly, then when a real
[02:12:28.680 --> 02:12:32.120]  convicted pedophile comes in to have your five-year-old sit on their lap, you're not
[02:12:32.120 --> 02:12:35.880]  even told it's happening at school, then you can't say anything because you never faced
[02:12:35.880 --> 02:12:39.520]  any crisis so it couldn't be real because the state's doing it to you.
[02:12:39.520 --> 02:12:40.520]  Exactly.
[02:12:40.520 --> 02:12:44.040]  I mean, you had public library events where now people that had child sex offenses were
[02:12:44.040 --> 02:12:46.560]  giving special presentations to kids.
[02:12:46.560 --> 02:12:51.640]  So clearly, and it's because they created an overprotective culture that was not empowering.
[02:12:51.640 --> 02:12:53.640]  And that's what all the themes sort of unite.
[02:12:53.640 --> 02:12:57.240]  Clearly the status, don't believe in empowering ordinary people, don't believe in empowering
[02:12:57.240 --> 02:12:58.240]  the audience to think about it.
[02:12:58.240 --> 02:12:59.240]  How did your dad raise you?
[02:12:59.240 --> 02:13:00.240]  Because I'm so lucky.
[02:13:00.240 --> 02:13:04.120]  The best thing that ever happened, my parents told me later, my mom, I was about 20, apologized
[02:13:04.120 --> 02:13:08.160]  and she said, you know, we just didn't want you to be a wimp.
[02:13:08.160 --> 02:13:11.640]  And you know, we had some members of the family that got coddled and they became wimps.
[02:13:11.640 --> 02:13:13.940]  We had other members of the family that became great people.
[02:13:13.940 --> 02:13:17.840]  So we just made the decision to let, you know, in schools, people beat you up and not fall
[02:13:17.840 --> 02:13:21.080]  complaints and let you do whatever you wanted and because you wanted a real man.
[02:13:21.080 --> 02:13:23.520]  And I felt that people understand that's how you produce men.
[02:13:23.520 --> 02:13:24.520]  Absolutely.
[02:13:24.520 --> 02:13:26.960]  You know, my family goes all the way back to the barns of Rhode Island.
[02:13:26.960 --> 02:13:29.700]  They came over on just a few ships after the Mayflower.
[02:13:29.700 --> 02:13:34.120]  They voted against the entire Constitution unless and until it included the Bill of Rights.
[02:13:34.120 --> 02:13:35.800]  They were part of the Rhode Island dissident movement.
[02:13:35.800 --> 02:13:38.920]  They wouldn't join the new federal union unless the Bill of Rights was added to it.
[02:13:38.920 --> 02:13:41.000]  That was the group that got it done, that in Virginia.
[02:13:41.000 --> 02:13:42.000]  Precisely, exactly.
[02:13:42.000 --> 02:13:46.000]  And so they deeply believed in it and my father celebrated that tradition, a trust and confidence
[02:13:46.000 --> 02:13:50.200]  in the power of ordinary people and everyday individuals to make their own decisions, not
[02:13:50.200 --> 02:13:54.240]  let the state, school, society or anybody dictate or determine what they think, how
[02:13:54.240 --> 02:13:57.680]  they think and what they see and what they read and make their own decisions.
[02:13:57.680 --> 02:13:58.680]  That's right.
[02:13:58.680 --> 02:13:59.680]  I want to be clear.
[02:13:59.680 --> 02:14:01.000]  My parents were like, sorry, wish we hadn't done it.
[02:14:01.000 --> 02:14:03.520]  They said, we're glad we did it, but still we felt bad.
[02:14:03.520 --> 02:14:04.520]  Oh yeah.
[02:14:04.520 --> 02:14:07.240]  It's necessary for the empowerment of the individual and those that's trust and confidence.
[02:14:07.240 --> 02:14:08.480]  Well, they just had to cut me loose.
[02:14:08.480 --> 02:14:09.480]  Right.
[02:14:09.480 --> 02:14:10.800]  And they said, we just cut you loose.
[02:14:10.800 --> 02:14:11.800]  Exactly.
[02:14:11.800 --> 02:14:15.800]  And sometimes that's necessary and fundamental to being able to function in a living, breathing
[02:14:15.800 --> 02:14:21.680]  society for the future that celebrates humanitarian and little D Democrat democratizing ideals
[02:14:21.680 --> 02:14:22.680]  rather than be.
[02:14:22.680 --> 02:14:26.360]  And that's why now all these bubble people, all these senators and lawyers that live in
[02:14:26.360 --> 02:14:30.560]  their fake world, like you said, they don't understand like Christian, I'm a poor arrest
[02:14:30.560 --> 02:14:32.120]  people that criticize the government.
[02:14:32.120 --> 02:14:37.200]  She doesn't get it that when they attack us and do this, I don't do it on purpose.
[02:14:37.200 --> 02:14:40.120]  I'm not a sadomasochist, but actually I like it.
[02:14:40.120 --> 02:14:44.840]  I mean, they don't understand like I'm, I'm, I love this and I just wish I, it's kind
[02:14:44.840 --> 02:14:45.840]  of sick.
[02:14:45.840 --> 02:14:46.840]  I admit that.
[02:14:46.840 --> 02:14:47.840]  But I just love this man.
[02:14:47.840 --> 02:14:48.840]  Well, it's the nature of it.
[02:14:48.840 --> 02:14:52.560]  It's proving the vitality of the ideas and the power of the ideas that people feel in
[02:14:52.560 --> 02:14:56.960]  need to try to suppress and censor and shame those ideas because if the ideas were intrinsically
[02:14:56.960 --> 02:15:00.760]  unpopular and undesirable, they'd be happy to have people have full access to them.
[02:15:00.760 --> 02:15:03.640]  That's why they don't care about David Duke having a wide ranging access because they
[02:15:03.640 --> 02:15:05.480]  know his ideas are deeply unpopular.
[02:15:05.480 --> 02:15:06.920]  Nobody wants anything to do with them.
[02:15:06.920 --> 02:15:09.680]  So instead they only try to suppress those ideas that are popular.
[02:15:09.680 --> 02:15:13.520]  Oh, Muslims are on there like sociologists, how to beat your wife, you know, how to kill
[02:15:13.520 --> 02:15:19.280]  gays, that's left up David Duke and I'm not saying take David Duke down, but exactly.
[02:15:19.280 --> 02:15:20.640]  I'm unifying people.
[02:15:20.640 --> 02:15:21.640]  Black people love me.
[02:15:21.640 --> 02:15:22.640]  I love them.
[02:15:22.640 --> 02:15:23.640]  Absolutely.
[02:15:23.640 --> 02:15:27.280]  The, the goal is what they want to do is to suppress those forms of speech and free
[02:15:27.280 --> 02:15:31.680]  press that bring people together, that unite people and that remind people of their human,
[02:15:31.680 --> 02:15:35.600]  their most human and their most little d democratic ideals and principles because those are the
[02:15:35.600 --> 02:15:40.320]  foundational freedoms of American liberty that lights the liberty for the world.
[02:15:40.320 --> 02:15:46.040]  Powerful, my barns made for radio folks and TV, we're going to get this guy to show over,

[02:17:24.520 --> 02:17:29.880]  The United States of Empire is a book that claims the United States is the empire of
[02:17:29.880 --> 02:17:30.880]  the world.
[02:17:30.880 --> 02:17:33.880]  George Washington had warned us against foreign wars.
[02:17:33.880 --> 02:17:39.840]  The United States of Empire shows that World Wars I and II left England broken.
[02:17:39.840 --> 02:17:43.640]  Its former colony, the U.S. had to save the empire.
[02:17:43.640 --> 02:17:44.640]  Was there ever a vote?
[02:17:44.640 --> 02:17:46.200]  Who do we fight for?
[02:17:46.200 --> 02:17:52.760]  The deep state began with World War I. The United States of Empire by James Dunne, available
[02:17:52.760 --> 02:17:56.480]  at Amazon Books.

[02:18:56.280 --> 02:18:58.360]  Frank in North Carolina, thanks for holding so long.
[02:18:58.360 --> 02:18:59.360]  Go ahead.
[02:18:59.360 --> 02:19:01.360]  Yeah, I just have to say something, man.
[02:19:01.360 --> 02:19:05.040]  It seems like every time I turn on your broadcast, you're bracking.
[02:19:05.040 --> 02:19:06.040]  It just gets old, man.
[02:19:06.040 --> 02:19:09.000]  I'm going to shut you down right now, okay?
[02:19:09.000 --> 02:19:11.240]  We're taking calls about your nomination.
[02:19:11.240 --> 02:19:15.440]  Do you understand they're having congressional hearings trying to shut us down?
[02:19:15.440 --> 02:19:17.920]  Do you understand I'm ringing the alarm?
[02:19:17.920 --> 02:19:20.920]  If that was happening to anybody else, I'd be freaked out.
[02:19:20.920 --> 02:19:23.680]  I mean, what's it going to take us being shut down?
[02:19:23.680 --> 02:19:24.680]  Is that what you want, Frank?
[02:19:24.680 --> 02:19:25.680]  You know what, Alex?
[02:19:25.680 --> 02:19:26.680]  Hey, put him on pause again.
[02:19:26.680 --> 02:19:32.200]  Hey, Frank, do you understand it's not bragging to say we are the tip of the spear, we're
[02:19:32.200 --> 02:19:34.080]  under attack, we need your help.
[02:19:34.080 --> 02:19:38.480]  As much begging as I do, we can barely pay the bills and grow in the face of this.
[02:19:38.480 --> 02:19:41.400]  I'm not going to just stop growth and let them start pushing us backwards.
[02:19:41.400 --> 02:19:42.400]  You understand?
[02:19:42.400 --> 02:19:43.400]  I need your help, Frank.
[02:19:43.400 --> 02:19:45.960]  I need your help, Frank.

[02:19:59.440 --> 02:20:25.440]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[02:20:25.440 --> 02:20:42.800]  We're in the middle of a great, beautiful, wonderful universe.
[02:20:42.800 --> 02:20:44.640]  Alex Jones here, back live.
[02:20:44.640 --> 02:20:50.640]  My hat lawyer under all these globalist attacks, Bob Barnes, smart guy, is here with us.
[02:20:50.640 --> 02:20:55.400]  I want to hit some other news and some clips we haven't gotten to yet right now, but let's
[02:20:55.400 --> 02:20:56.400]  get started.
[02:20:56.400 --> 02:21:00.000]  First, you're making some great points about adversity in young people and how really successful
[02:21:00.000 --> 02:21:03.880]  folks will end up having other children, and my children are great.
[02:21:03.880 --> 02:21:05.520]  They're awesome, but it's true.
[02:21:05.520 --> 02:21:09.200]  The things I went through, I'm way more protective than my parents were who made the conscious
[02:21:09.200 --> 02:21:16.880]  decision to throw me in the pit of the shark tank, and it's probably because my ex-wife
[02:21:16.880 --> 02:21:22.520]  would never have allowed it, but it's me, and it's where I grew up and where I came
[02:21:22.520 --> 02:21:27.960]  from, and I just can't do it to them, and I guess that's why sports are good or discipline
[02:21:27.960 --> 02:21:35.640]  is good, but there's nothing like being 12 years old, having five or six people that
[02:21:35.640 --> 02:21:43.280]  are 16, 17 years old, kick your ass, overcome it, and then years later, I'm not trying to
[02:21:43.280 --> 02:21:47.880]  be mean, but put those guys in the hospital, track them all down, put them in the hospital.
[02:21:47.880 --> 02:21:49.320]  That's not some tough guy's statement.
[02:21:49.320 --> 02:21:56.280]  It's like not just, I'm not saying physical power is the proof of mental acumen, I would
[02:21:56.280 --> 02:22:02.680]  just say that those things in me young triggered all the other richness of being a man that
[02:22:02.680 --> 02:22:06.680]  I don't see most men have who just constantly have avoidance of conflict.
[02:22:06.680 --> 02:22:11.200]  Yeah, I think basically fundamentally adversity builds instincts, so the effect of having
[02:22:11.200 --> 02:22:15.520]  to survive difficult circumstances, that's why you see people that come from lower income
[02:22:15.520 --> 02:22:20.720]  or working class backgrounds or have to deal with some life trauma, end up stronger people,
[02:22:20.720 --> 02:22:25.520]  more capable of handling difficult circumstances, more capable of surviving no matter what comes
[02:22:25.520 --> 02:22:28.520]  at them in the world because they've had that experience.
[02:22:28.520 --> 02:22:32.800]  There's something to like the Sparta, the movie 300 where the kid gets sent out to live
[02:22:32.800 --> 02:22:34.160]  and survive amongst the wolves.
[02:22:34.160 --> 02:22:36.600]  Well that's a boiled down snapshot of real stuff that happened.
[02:22:36.600 --> 02:22:40.240]  Precisely, and what it is, it made them tough, they didn't do it because they wanted the
[02:22:40.240 --> 02:22:44.680]  10 year old to die, they did it because they needed that person to be stronger, they needed
[02:22:44.680 --> 02:22:46.720]  them to be able to survive in a difficult environment.
[02:22:46.720 --> 02:22:49.200]  Because if they didn't, he'd die for sure when he was 20.
[02:22:49.200 --> 02:22:52.360]  Precisely, not only would he die, but the people he was trying to protect would die.
[02:22:52.360 --> 02:22:55.960]  So they knew in order to be able to protect everything that mattered to them, they had
[02:22:55.960 --> 02:22:58.000]  to train them under the most difficult circumstances.
[02:22:58.000 --> 02:23:01.240]  The same way we train seals, the reason why we do what we do, I mean they actually physically
[02:23:01.240 --> 02:23:04.720]  drown them for a period of time, the reason we do that is because that's what makes them
[02:23:04.720 --> 02:23:05.960]  tough enough to be able to not...
[02:23:05.960 --> 02:23:09.240]  Or things like the Marines, the old little secret was out of any big graduating class
[02:23:09.240 --> 02:23:12.680]  usually somebody died and they weren't doing that just to kill somebody, they had to add
[02:23:12.680 --> 02:23:16.440]  enough realness, enough danger to figure out who could handle it.
[02:23:16.440 --> 02:23:20.120]  Precisely, because not only are they protecting their own lives in difficult circumstances,
[02:23:20.120 --> 02:23:23.600]  but they need to be able to thrive in those difficult circumstances to protect everybody.
[02:23:23.600 --> 02:23:27.560]  Well that's what I never got about, oh what's the movie, you were bringing it up with Jack
[02:23:27.560 --> 02:23:32.600]  Nicholson and Tom Kruse about On the Wall and You Can't Handle the Truth.
[02:23:32.600 --> 02:23:33.600]  Oh yeah, a few good men.
[02:23:33.600 --> 02:23:35.280]  Yeah, it's like that guy's actually the good guy.
[02:23:35.280 --> 02:23:36.280]  Right.
[02:23:36.280 --> 02:23:37.280]  Like I'm not saying that's...
[02:23:37.280 --> 02:23:38.280]  Sure.
[02:23:38.280 --> 02:23:39.280]  That's actually real.
[02:23:39.280 --> 02:23:42.600]  Absolutely, in fact the screenplay writers is based initially on a Broadway play.
[02:23:42.600 --> 02:23:45.240]  And he said he wanted to celebrate both characters.
[02:23:45.240 --> 02:23:48.760]  He was saying he wanted people who could relate to Tom Kruse as character and who could relate
[02:23:48.760 --> 02:23:52.240]  to Jack Nicholson's character because he said there was moral justification in both.
[02:23:52.240 --> 02:23:57.040]  And Nicholson liked it so much that he would keep doing the rant when he was even off-camera.
[02:23:57.040 --> 02:23:58.040]  Because he was like, this is...
[02:23:58.040 --> 02:24:01.200]  He believed and he was like, you need me on that wall, you want me on that wall and the
[02:24:01.200 --> 02:24:03.520]  truth is there is some truth to that.
[02:24:03.520 --> 02:24:08.040]  That we need people like that on that wall because we don't want people that are like...
[02:24:08.040 --> 02:24:09.720]  Do we want Adam Schiff defending us?
[02:24:09.720 --> 02:24:11.360]  We want Adam Schiff out in the field?
[02:24:11.360 --> 02:24:13.480]  We want Adam Schiff being the guy who's on the wall?
[02:24:13.480 --> 02:24:15.680]  No, the wall would be gone and dead tomorrow.
[02:24:15.680 --> 02:24:19.320]  So that's why we need people that have life experience that toughens them.
[02:24:19.320 --> 02:24:21.560]  That's the reason why it's great for Trump.
[02:24:21.560 --> 02:24:22.960]  The fact that Trump has been through economic...
[02:24:22.960 --> 02:24:24.440]  Oh, there's no doubt it's Providence.
[02:24:24.440 --> 02:24:26.960]  And people go, well, is he a total Christian?
[02:24:26.960 --> 02:24:27.960]  Yes, especially now.
[02:24:27.960 --> 02:24:30.160]  It doesn't matter.
[02:24:30.160 --> 02:24:33.440]  God in the whole Bible and history would put sometimes wicked people in charge if they
[02:24:33.440 --> 02:24:34.440]  get the job done.
[02:24:34.440 --> 02:24:35.440]  Oh, of course.
[02:24:35.440 --> 02:24:37.440]  And the point is it's like the perfect...
[02:24:37.440 --> 02:24:40.760]  People didn't believe in Manifest Destiny or America's Luck that Bismarck said God
[02:24:40.760 --> 02:24:44.000]  loves children drunk to the United States of America.
[02:24:44.000 --> 02:24:47.120]  Other governments were already marveling at our luck over and over again.
[02:24:47.120 --> 02:24:48.120]  Like...
[02:24:48.120 --> 02:24:49.120]  True.
[02:24:49.120 --> 02:24:51.240]  Well, in particular with Trump, you have someone that Scott Adams pointed out.
[02:24:51.240 --> 02:24:54.080]  One of the best things was that he went through difficulty in Atlantic City.
[02:24:54.080 --> 02:24:57.560]  If he just coasted through life and he'd never dealt with any economic difficulty, never
[02:24:57.560 --> 02:24:58.560]  dealt with any political difficulties...
[02:24:58.560 --> 02:24:59.960]  Or his brother died on a liver failure?
[02:24:59.960 --> 02:25:00.960]  Exactly.
[02:25:00.960 --> 02:25:02.640]  If he'd never had any family issues that he had to deal with...
[02:25:02.640 --> 02:25:03.840]  He wouldn't drink because of it?
[02:25:03.840 --> 02:25:06.400]  The public divorce issues that he had to deal with, the...
[02:25:06.400 --> 02:25:09.120]  He learned all about media, all about taking stuff.
[02:25:09.120 --> 02:25:13.560]  And I'm not bragging, but the levels of attack they've done on me in 25 years, now people
[02:25:13.560 --> 02:25:14.560]  go...
[02:25:14.560 --> 02:25:15.560]  Family comes over to the...
[02:25:15.560 --> 02:25:16.560]  How are you handling it?
[02:25:16.560 --> 02:25:17.560]  I'm like...
[02:25:17.560 --> 02:25:18.560]  I'm great.
[02:25:18.560 --> 02:25:19.560]  I'm wonderful.
[02:25:19.560 --> 02:25:20.560]  I love it.
[02:25:20.560 --> 02:25:21.560]  Yeah, you get accustomed to it and you get tougher each time you go through.
[02:25:21.560 --> 02:25:22.560]  You know, it's the...
[02:25:22.560 --> 02:25:25.480]  But again, it's the old bomber thing from World War II.
[02:25:25.480 --> 02:25:26.480]  It's true.
[02:25:26.480 --> 02:25:28.080]  They didn't have radar until the end of the war.
[02:25:28.080 --> 02:25:29.080]  They didn't know where the targets were.
[02:25:29.080 --> 02:25:30.480]  It was all dead reckoning.
[02:25:30.480 --> 02:25:34.280]  But the Germans would put up the anti-aircraft around what they were supposed to bomb.
[02:25:34.280 --> 02:25:35.480]  So you fly to the attack.
[02:25:35.480 --> 02:25:36.480]  Exactly.
[02:25:36.480 --> 02:25:37.480]  That was just the nature of it.
[02:25:37.480 --> 02:25:39.520]  And they learned and they had a different level of discipline.
[02:25:39.520 --> 02:25:43.400]  I mean, particularly, you can tell the World War II generation arguably was the greatest
[02:25:43.400 --> 02:25:44.400]  generation.
[02:25:44.400 --> 02:25:45.400]  Why is that?
[02:25:45.400 --> 02:25:48.200]  Because they went through difficulty in the Great Depression and a World War that made
[02:25:48.200 --> 02:25:52.400]  them mentally, psychologically, and emotionally tougher to protect American freedoms, come
[02:25:52.400 --> 02:25:55.440]  hell or high water than any other generation since then.
[02:25:55.440 --> 02:25:59.720]  And particularly the millennial generation, which right now is symbolized by AOC.
[02:25:59.720 --> 02:26:00.720]  So the...
[02:26:00.720 --> 02:26:02.720]  It's entitled, stupid, weak.
[02:26:02.720 --> 02:26:03.720]  Oh, precisely.
[02:26:03.720 --> 02:26:06.080]  I mean, I'm not trying to act like I'm tough, because I'm not in the best shape as I work
[02:26:06.080 --> 02:26:07.080]  all the time.
[02:26:07.080 --> 02:26:08.080]  I mean, you go to a college.
[02:26:08.080 --> 02:26:09.080]  You go out around leftist.
[02:26:09.080 --> 02:26:11.840]  I mean, they look like they've had their brain scooped out, man.
[02:26:11.840 --> 02:26:12.840]  They just are like...
[02:26:12.840 --> 02:26:16.040]  They look like zombies.
[02:26:16.040 --> 02:26:17.320]  Like their hands hang at their side.
[02:26:17.320 --> 02:26:21.200]  They walk around staring and they giggle and snicker and they don't care.
[02:26:21.200 --> 02:26:22.200]  And they're just stupid.
[02:26:22.200 --> 02:26:25.560]  Well, you see that in the kind of people who are mocking people like the elderly Jewish
[02:26:25.560 --> 02:26:30.360]  man in Palo Alto, they're not the kind of people you say, I want to be like that.
[02:26:30.360 --> 02:26:31.360]  They're not strong.
[02:26:31.360 --> 02:26:32.360]  They're not powerful.
[02:26:32.360 --> 02:26:33.360]  They're not...
[02:26:33.360 --> 02:26:34.360]  They're not confident.
[02:26:34.360 --> 02:26:38.320]  There's a lot of where this status suppression comes from of not having any dissident speech
[02:26:38.320 --> 02:26:39.320]  allowed on camera.
[02:26:39.320 --> 02:26:42.520]  And they have that last ingredient, though, of seeking the power, precisely, because they
[02:26:42.520 --> 02:26:43.520]  need it.
[02:26:43.520 --> 02:26:47.200]  Because they feel so weak, they need the state's power to feel strong.
[02:26:47.200 --> 02:26:48.200]  And that's the...
[02:26:48.200 --> 02:26:49.200]  And that's the core problem.
[02:26:49.200 --> 02:26:53.160]  They don't have the independence of thought and an independence of spirit necessary to
[02:26:53.160 --> 02:26:55.120]  keep the light of liberty alive.
[02:26:55.120 --> 02:26:57.600]  And they believe the corporate media is dominant.
[02:26:57.600 --> 02:27:02.000]  So she kept trying to get them to attack him, and they wouldn't, and she couldn't believe
[02:27:02.000 --> 02:27:03.000]  it.
[02:27:03.000 --> 02:27:04.000]  So she said, I'm going to get you.
[02:27:04.000 --> 02:27:05.000]  I'm going to get you fired.
[02:27:05.000 --> 02:27:06.000]  I'll be at your house.
[02:27:06.000 --> 02:27:07.000]  Well, that was terroristic.
[02:27:07.000 --> 02:27:08.000]  So she lost her job.
[02:27:08.000 --> 02:27:09.800]  She just didn't even understand.
[02:27:09.800 --> 02:27:10.800]  Precisely.
[02:27:10.800 --> 02:27:14.640]  It's because of a mindset that if somebody disagrees with me, that's scary and frightening.
[02:27:14.640 --> 02:27:19.240]  I'm not independent enough, and I'm not self-confident enough to win in the debate of public arena.
[02:27:19.240 --> 02:27:23.720]  So I have to suppress, censor, and shame you, ostracize you, isolate you, economically
[02:27:23.720 --> 02:27:24.720]  punish you.
[02:27:24.720 --> 02:27:25.720]  How did they...
[02:27:25.720 --> 02:27:26.720]  How did they get them?
[02:27:26.720 --> 02:27:29.120]  Because I used to get annoyed by USA Chance because, yeah, I love America, but that whole
[02:27:29.120 --> 02:27:33.080]  USA thing can be used for imperial wars and things, and I think that's bad.
[02:27:33.080 --> 02:27:37.160]  But then I love USA Chance now because I learned about, you know, America's coming back at
[02:27:37.160 --> 02:27:42.160]  leftist events the last three years, I'm imploring them, hey, don't you love America?
[02:27:42.160 --> 02:27:43.160]  That's when they flip.
[02:27:43.160 --> 02:27:47.800]  They have been trained like baby birds that have imprinted on something to hate the country.
[02:27:47.800 --> 02:27:51.280]  The average leftist now literally hates America.
[02:27:51.280 --> 02:27:52.280]  It's very much self-hatred.
[02:27:52.280 --> 02:27:56.640]  So you see, you know, the people that will be, you know, white guys who will say, I hate
[02:27:56.640 --> 02:27:58.880]  the fact that I'm a white guy, and it's like, why?
[02:27:58.880 --> 02:27:59.880]  That's insane.
[02:27:59.880 --> 02:28:03.560]  There's no reason to engage in racism or suppress racism.
[02:28:03.560 --> 02:28:06.160]  The answer to less racism is less racism.
[02:28:06.160 --> 02:28:10.480]  That's total racism to say, like, Biden, it's bad that I'm white.
[02:28:10.480 --> 02:28:11.480]  What the hell?
[02:28:11.480 --> 02:28:12.480]  It's just insane.
[02:28:12.480 --> 02:28:14.600]  I mean, if I saw a black guy going, it's bad to be black.
[02:28:14.600 --> 02:28:15.600]  I mean, what the hell?
[02:28:15.600 --> 02:28:18.320]  I mean, I see people are cret, we're all individuals.
[02:28:18.320 --> 02:28:19.320]  Exactly, all of them.
[02:28:19.320 --> 02:28:23.200]  And what's unifying about us is the we are Americans, is the we are USA, and that's of
[02:28:23.200 --> 02:28:25.200]  all creeds, all colors, all racism, all religions.
[02:28:25.200 --> 02:28:26.200]  I didn't used to get it now.
[02:28:26.200 --> 02:28:28.960]  Oh, God, I used to like make fun of it because I love America.
[02:28:28.960 --> 02:28:31.160]  It's like family, like Texas flags, Texas is great.
[02:28:31.160 --> 02:28:34.600]  You know, like, God, I thought they were being arrogant, so I realized how great Texas was
[02:28:34.600 --> 02:28:35.600]  compared to other places.
[02:28:35.600 --> 02:28:38.760]  Then I'm like, oh my God, Texas, man, USA.
[02:28:38.760 --> 02:28:42.800]  Exactly, America has its problems, but America is still the best answer out there for all
[02:28:42.800 --> 02:28:44.360]  of the problems the world faces.
[02:28:44.360 --> 02:28:45.360]  Damn right.
[02:28:45.360 --> 02:28:47.960]  We're going to talk about why America is so great when we come back and play this clip
[02:28:47.960 --> 02:28:55.400]  of this bully that got her due and got her ass fired.

[02:30:20.320 --> 02:30:24.480]  the chemicals and the food and water to fight back against the modern day lifestyle with
[02:30:24.480 --> 02:30:29.480]  the screen time and the extended hours to still have the stamina and endurance, energy

[02:30:56.980 --> 02:30:58.480]  I want to say brain force is great.
[02:30:58.480 --> 02:31:00.440]  I want to say turbo force is amazing.
[02:31:00.440 --> 02:31:01.440]  It is.
[02:31:01.440 --> 02:31:05.920]  But if you took it with fish oil, it's like the fish oil is it.
[02:31:05.920 --> 02:31:09.160]  The fish oil is better than it and that's an example of what I'm talking about.
[02:31:09.160 --> 02:31:14.720]  Fish oil is liquid energy, brain, body, heart, the cleanest, the best out there.
[02:31:14.720 --> 02:31:15.720]  You've got the children's.
[02:31:15.720 --> 02:31:16.720]  You've got the adults.
[02:31:16.720 --> 02:31:17.720]  You've got the krill oil.
[02:31:17.720 --> 02:31:21.560]  If you're going to get the full effect, the fish oil and the children's are really strong.
[02:31:21.560 --> 02:31:24.920]  They don't give you the burpees, but krill oils is the best and it'll give you the damn
[02:31:24.920 --> 02:31:25.920]  burps.
[02:31:25.920 --> 02:31:26.920]  And I'm sorry.
[02:31:26.920 --> 02:31:27.920]  You want something like this.
[02:31:27.920 --> 02:31:28.920]  You don't get stuff for free.
[02:31:28.920 --> 02:31:29.920]  The krill is hallucinogenic.
[02:31:29.920 --> 02:31:30.920]  It's so good.
[02:31:30.920 --> 02:31:31.920]  In my view.
[02:31:31.920 --> 02:31:32.920]  I'm not a medical statement here.
[02:31:32.920 --> 02:31:33.920]  But let me tell you something.
[02:31:33.920 --> 02:31:39.880]  I've seen five Catholics of krill oil before I go to bed, I'm seeing Santa Claus that night.
[02:31:39.880 --> 02:31:47.360]  So your brain is made basically out of what fish oil is.
[02:31:47.360 --> 02:31:50.800]  So we don't make a big profit off of it, but you notice I just obsess because whatever
[02:31:50.800 --> 02:31:53.280]  the best is we've got, I just can't lie to you.
[02:31:53.280 --> 02:31:56.560]  I just can't do it.
[02:31:56.560 --> 02:32:01.440]  There are thousands of ideologies out there, hundreds of different political systems.
[02:32:01.440 --> 02:32:06.480]  And most of them are funded by the globalist info wars is truly the tip of the spear of
[02:32:06.480 --> 02:32:07.480]  the zeitgeist.
[02:32:07.480 --> 02:32:10.560]  That's why the globalists are obsessed with it, trying to shut it down.
[02:32:10.560 --> 02:32:12.200]  I didn't invent all this.
[02:32:12.200 --> 02:32:16.960]  I went and researched the Renaissance, Americana and what really works for humanity.
[02:32:16.960 --> 02:32:18.480]  And I'm simply trying to bring it back.
[02:32:18.480 --> 02:32:22.840]  And lo and behold, it's super popular like it's always been.
[02:32:22.840 --> 02:32:26.840]  That's why the globalists are trying to shut it down so desperately because we have the
[02:32:26.840 --> 02:32:30.720]  light in the dark of the night that's since chills up my spine.
[02:32:30.720 --> 02:32:35.280]  So whatever you do, continue to support yourself and info wars by buying the great products
[02:32:35.280 --> 02:32:39.680]  and info wars store.com by spreading the articles by spreading the videos and by praying for
[02:32:39.680 --> 02:32:44.280]  this operation and for praying for this nation and the world for peace and discernment for
[02:32:44.280 --> 02:32:46.240]  myself and the whole info wars family.
[02:32:46.240 --> 02:32:52.160]  I want to thank all of you for what you've done because without you info wars is nothing.
[02:32:52.160 --> 02:32:59.440]  You are the info war and I salute you.
[02:32:59.440 --> 02:33:16.920]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic.
[02:33:16.920 --> 02:33:32.960]  This is Alex Jones.
[02:33:32.960 --> 02:33:58.280]  I cross my heart and promise the viewers and listeners I'll do whatever it takes to not
[02:33:58.280 --> 02:34:02.960]  back down.
[02:34:02.960 --> 02:34:07.800]  But that's not because I'm some goody tissues because I believe in America and I believe
[02:34:07.800 --> 02:34:11.640]  in free market and I believe in freedom and I believe in you and we're in this together
[02:34:11.640 --> 02:34:13.360]  and you're the reason we're here.
[02:34:13.360 --> 02:34:18.440]  You stood against the globalists, you back info wars, you back what we're doing.
[02:34:18.440 --> 02:34:22.600]  And the globalists, they're all back by Soros and a few billionaires, mainline right wingers
[02:34:22.600 --> 02:34:26.880]  are all back by I guess the Koch brothers of the Merchers and that's why they can't
[02:34:26.880 --> 02:34:30.840]  believe there's people out there that aren't back by the system.
[02:34:30.840 --> 02:34:34.160]  But I'll tell you something, there are great people all this country like Bob Barnes who
[02:34:34.160 --> 02:34:38.600]  wins like 90% of his big cases, won one of the biggest civil rights cases in US history
[02:34:38.600 --> 02:34:43.880]  last week, almost zero coverage in Milwaukee over a real black man tortured to death and
[02:34:43.880 --> 02:34:50.160]  killed and it was just a negligence but it unified everybody and so the right thing happened.
[02:34:50.160 --> 02:34:52.080]  And they never talk about our real victories.
[02:34:52.080 --> 02:34:57.080]  They always only promote our so-called defeats and they're obsessed with that perception.
[02:34:57.080 --> 02:35:02.080]  Oh absolutely because the fact of their obsession shows the power of the message and the power
[02:35:02.080 --> 02:35:08.320]  of the audience and it basically upsets them so much and unsettles them so much that they
[02:35:08.320 --> 02:35:11.840]  feel the need to suppress and censor where they wouldn't otherwise.
[02:35:11.840 --> 02:35:14.600]  They wouldn't push for censorship and they wouldn't push for shaming and they wouldn't
[02:35:14.600 --> 02:35:18.960]  push for ostracism and they wouldn't have the need to run after an older Jewish guy
[02:35:18.960 --> 02:35:23.040]  with a hat on his hand and on his head to threaten him, I mean I'm going to get underneath
[02:35:23.040 --> 02:35:24.040]  that.
[02:35:24.040 --> 02:35:25.040]  We're coming to your house, we're going to get you.
[02:35:25.040 --> 02:35:26.040]  Exactly.
[02:35:26.040 --> 02:35:28.720]  Don't need to do that but for the power of the message and the power of the ordinary
[02:35:28.720 --> 02:35:29.720]  individual.
[02:35:29.720 --> 02:35:34.000]  They're threatened not by really even infowars, they're threatened by the audience that supports
[02:35:34.000 --> 02:35:35.000]  infowars.
[02:35:35.000 --> 02:35:39.200]  They're not threatened by Trump as much as they are threatened by the people who back
[02:35:39.200 --> 02:35:41.840]  Trump and put him into power in the first place.
[02:35:41.840 --> 02:35:46.400]  So that's what's unique about them is they recognize the power of the message, the power
[02:35:46.400 --> 02:35:51.200]  of the people, the power of American democracy to restore itself by ordinary, everyday people
[02:35:51.200 --> 02:35:56.160]  asserting their individual power and re-democratizing American society, American politics, American
[02:35:56.160 --> 02:36:00.480]  economy that they feel the need to suppress it by any means possible, whether it's lying
[02:36:00.480 --> 02:36:04.880]  and libeling about people, whether it's flooding the border completely with tens of millions
[02:36:04.880 --> 02:36:05.880]  of people.
[02:36:05.880 --> 02:36:06.880]  I mean it's insane.
[02:36:06.880 --> 02:36:07.880]  It's one extreme thing.
[02:36:07.880 --> 02:36:10.960]  What are they going to do though as they keep losing because undoubtedly in the real
[02:36:10.960 --> 02:36:15.400]  world of people's minds, we're converting people back to Americana.
[02:36:15.400 --> 02:36:19.720]  I think that's correct me if I'm wrong, but they still have a lot of the temporal power
[02:36:19.720 --> 02:36:20.720]  of the institutions.
[02:36:20.720 --> 02:36:23.680]  Yeah, what you're seeing is you're seeing the desire to credential journalism through
[02:36:23.680 --> 02:36:28.440]  the state and they're going to use Republican dupes to do it.
[02:36:28.440 --> 02:36:32.880]  You're seeing the effort to control and cabin speech through having Facebook ask for federal
[02:36:32.880 --> 02:36:37.280]  regulation that allows them to basically have state sanctioned censorship moving forward.
[02:36:37.280 --> 02:36:41.480]  Because they know they're going to lose 230 by what they've done, so they want a new super
[02:36:41.480 --> 02:36:46.640]  230 where they can be censor, cheap cooking, bottle washer, all of it.
[02:36:46.640 --> 02:36:48.200]  Exactly, where they can have official news.
[02:36:48.200 --> 02:36:51.480]  And the Republicans not coming in with prohibitive regulations like the First Amendment saying
[02:36:51.480 --> 02:36:53.920]  you will not bar this, have created a vacuum.
[02:36:53.920 --> 02:36:54.920]  Trump has to come in.
[02:36:54.920 --> 02:36:55.920]  Absolutely.
[02:36:55.920 --> 02:36:59.400]  And they've suckered Trump a little bit because he gets distracted by the libels that we get
[02:36:59.400 --> 02:37:00.400]  waged against him.
[02:37:00.400 --> 02:37:02.480]  And so he talks about opening up libel laws.
[02:37:02.480 --> 02:37:06.480]  That's a trap for him to approve a dangerous precedent of having a ministry of information.
[02:37:06.480 --> 02:37:10.680]  Yeah, well, I didn't have to sign an honest closer over this one, but I did get approached
[02:37:10.680 --> 02:37:14.520]  by the Republican leadership, the old guard.
[02:37:14.520 --> 02:37:16.760]  And it was exactly what I thought when it first went on.
[02:37:16.760 --> 02:37:20.880]  I told some of the crew, it was at the meeting, I said, watch, this is what this really is.
[02:37:20.880 --> 02:37:23.560]  And they just said, hey, get out of the way.
[02:37:23.560 --> 02:37:26.440]  The Republicans, which I already knew had been the Wall Street Journal, the Republican
[02:37:26.440 --> 02:37:28.920]  old guard is backing the end of free speech.
[02:37:28.920 --> 02:37:34.280]  And they've got the idiots, the Democrats as they call them, the idiots, supporting the
[02:37:34.280 --> 02:37:37.440]  end of New York Times versus Sullivan to get you.
[02:37:37.440 --> 02:37:38.760]  This is perfect.
[02:37:38.760 --> 02:37:42.480]  But would you like to come in out of the dark because they're worried we're going to win
[02:37:42.480 --> 02:37:43.480]  this?
[02:37:43.480 --> 02:37:44.480]  And this is all off records.
[02:37:44.480 --> 02:37:46.400]  I can't say the names on there.
[02:37:46.400 --> 02:37:52.840]  But I mean, that's how big these cases are, is that it's high level.
[02:37:52.840 --> 02:37:53.840]  Absolutely.
[02:37:53.840 --> 02:37:55.360]  These are the seminal fundamental cases.
[02:37:55.360 --> 02:37:59.320]  So like the way New York Times and these Sullivan came to the fore was the effort of
[02:37:59.320 --> 02:38:04.280]  people opposing civil rights in the South, misusing and abusing the legal process to try
[02:38:04.280 --> 02:38:07.280]  to prevent advertising, supporting civil rights.
[02:38:07.280 --> 02:38:09.360]  And to file hundreds of lawsuits against papers.
[02:38:09.360 --> 02:38:10.360]  Precisely.
[02:38:10.360 --> 02:38:14.560]  And to basically force those papers not to allow other people's speech to be voiced on
[02:38:14.560 --> 02:38:15.600]  those papers.
[02:38:15.600 --> 02:38:18.440]  And that's why New York Times and the Sullivan happened in the first place.
[02:38:18.440 --> 02:38:22.320]  It was to protect fundamental civil rights because the only way civil rights were, if
[02:38:22.320 --> 02:38:26.080]  there was no free speech and no free press, there is no Martin Luther King speech, there
[02:38:26.080 --> 02:38:28.560]  is no Martin Luther King march, there's no march on the film.
[02:38:28.560 --> 02:38:29.560]  Exactly.
[02:38:29.560 --> 02:38:33.280]  So the ethos of modern American liberties under attack, and it's not some Machiavelli thing
[02:38:33.280 --> 02:38:38.680]  where I go, hey, Democrats, hey, newspapers, you're about to lose your free press.
[02:38:38.680 --> 02:38:42.200]  You've been set up by the establishment Democrats and Republicans.
[02:38:42.200 --> 02:38:47.480]  If there's one thing I'm credit size Trump for, he actually, the word is, isn't sure.
[02:38:47.480 --> 02:38:48.480]  And it's behind the scenes.
[02:38:48.480 --> 02:38:52.560]  We get warning mainstream media goes, watch out all your censorship.
[02:38:52.560 --> 02:38:54.160]  You're going to get censored too.
[02:38:54.160 --> 02:38:58.440]  And I just hope he doesn't do that because then that would really be a moral of Trump
[02:38:58.440 --> 02:38:59.440]  does that.
[02:38:59.440 --> 02:39:05.000]  But the word is he's being sold by blue blood Republicans, the same ones that invited him
[02:39:05.000 --> 02:39:07.520]  to the funeral to do this.
[02:39:07.520 --> 02:39:11.040]  And it's just, and the Democrats, they won't believe me because they don't know I tell
[02:39:11.040 --> 02:39:12.040]  the truth.
[02:39:12.040 --> 02:39:15.080]  They're just saying, oh, he's saying that because we're on his tail.
[02:39:15.080 --> 02:39:16.080]  We're going to win.
[02:39:16.080 --> 02:39:17.080]  Oh, give me a break.
[02:39:17.080 --> 02:39:18.080]  I can win anything.
[02:39:18.080 --> 02:39:19.080]  Precisely.
[02:39:19.080 --> 02:39:22.200]  And it's all you're going to lose your ass because you're so freaking stupid.
[02:39:22.200 --> 02:39:23.880]  Any kind of precedent is a bad precedent.
[02:39:23.880 --> 02:39:28.400]  So like you see now the Democrats in Congress, Nadler and others calling for the disclosure
[02:39:28.400 --> 02:39:32.440]  of private tax return records, those records have been kept private for a very long time
[02:39:32.440 --> 02:39:33.440]  for very good reasons.
[02:39:33.440 --> 02:39:36.280]  They're going to assault all those business partners precisely.
[02:39:36.280 --> 02:39:39.960]  And the precedent that would be set would be the now tax returns are open game for any
[02:39:39.960 --> 02:39:42.400]  politician anytime, anywhere, any place.
[02:39:42.400 --> 02:39:43.920]  They're not going to draw a limit.
[02:39:43.920 --> 02:39:47.040]  They're saying they have a legislative purpose, which is rather ludicrous for their subpoena.
[02:39:47.040 --> 02:39:50.760]  Oh, it's like, it's like the give us the name of every employee you have.
[02:39:50.760 --> 02:39:52.120]  So I fight them for too much.
[02:39:52.120 --> 02:39:56.120]  The lawyers are like, why don't you want to know because you're going to harass my employees.
[02:39:56.120 --> 02:39:57.960]  You're going to leak it like you do everything.
[02:39:57.960 --> 02:40:02.560]  All the policy, you know, as soon as the politicians in the press get ahold of anything in this
[02:40:02.560 --> 02:40:04.480]  case, they misuse it and abuse it.
[02:40:04.480 --> 02:40:07.360]  And the dangerous precedent that Democrats are setting is do that.
[02:40:07.360 --> 02:40:10.600]  Do they think that when Republicans are in control, they won't use the same power?
[02:40:10.600 --> 02:40:14.120]  That the reason why we don't allow the state to do it, even when we ourselves are our politically
[02:40:14.120 --> 02:40:17.920]  out allied into explaining it, chivalry, isn't you're a wimp.
[02:40:17.920 --> 02:40:20.880]  You don't kill women and children because you don't want yours killed.
[02:40:20.880 --> 02:40:24.880]  The minute you cross that line, everyone gets slaughtered precisely.
[02:40:24.880 --> 02:40:28.800]  That's what the First Amendment was critical to protect everybody all the time, everywhere,
[02:40:28.800 --> 02:40:32.480]  even those we completely disagree with when we find completely obnoxious because it's
[02:40:32.480 --> 02:40:33.680]  necessary to protect our people.
[02:40:33.680 --> 02:40:37.720]  Why is the left not smart enough to keep checks and balances into process there?
[02:40:37.720 --> 02:40:40.480]  I mean, the damn stuff protects everybody.
[02:40:40.480 --> 02:40:42.080]  I call it safe space statism.
[02:40:42.080 --> 02:40:43.080]  That's really what it is.
[02:40:43.080 --> 02:40:46.720]  It's a combination of safe space culture with a statist mindset that says we need a state
[02:40:46.720 --> 02:40:47.720]  involved to protect.
[02:40:47.720 --> 02:40:51.480]  They think they're protecting everybody while they get rid of what makes civilization.
[02:40:51.480 --> 02:40:52.480]  Exactly.
[02:40:52.480 --> 02:40:55.600]  It makes the foundation of all freedom secure and protected.
[02:40:55.600 --> 02:40:58.320]  There's no civil rights movement without free speech and free press.
[02:40:58.320 --> 02:41:01.080]  There's no anti-war movement without free speech and free press.
[02:41:01.080 --> 02:41:04.640]  There's no American liberty movement of any kind, whether it's expanding the vote to
[02:41:04.640 --> 02:41:07.800]  women, whether it's making sure African-American civil liberties are protected, whether it's
[02:41:07.800 --> 02:41:11.160]  abolition of slavery without free speech and free press.
[02:41:11.160 --> 02:41:12.160]  America didn't end slavery.
[02:41:12.160 --> 02:41:16.560]  It didn't begin slavery, but it was the first country to begin to end slavery.
[02:41:16.560 --> 02:41:20.840]  That liberty only exists because free speech exists, free press exists, and people's rights
[02:41:20.840 --> 02:41:23.000]  to secure that freedom through the Second Amendment.
[02:41:23.000 --> 02:41:28.840]  And the fact that Christina Amonpour and Senator Murphy are on TV saying, get rid of speech,
[02:41:28.840 --> 02:41:32.040]  arrest people, because that's when I went out to the veto event.
[02:41:32.040 --> 02:41:34.200]  Everybody's kept screaming, we're going to arrest you.
[02:41:34.200 --> 02:41:35.200]  We're going to get you.
[02:41:35.200 --> 02:41:39.840]  And there was this big thing of media people up there, and they pointed me and they go,
[02:41:39.840 --> 02:41:40.840]  it's him.
[02:41:40.840 --> 02:41:41.840]  Arrest him.
[02:41:41.840 --> 02:41:42.840]  Get him.
[02:41:42.840 --> 02:41:43.840]  And the crowd goes, there's video.
[02:41:43.840 --> 02:41:51.240]  They go, you can't choose, you're trying to, and it's like, what in the world happened
[02:41:51.240 --> 02:41:52.240]  to these people?
[02:41:52.240 --> 02:41:53.240]  Precisely.
[02:41:53.240 --> 02:41:56.480]  There are people who hear independent speech and independent press as a bad thing.
[02:41:56.480 --> 02:42:02.160]  It's very much an inquisition era, a Soviet mentality, fascist mindset that says that
[02:42:02.160 --> 02:42:06.320]  it's independent speech that's the threat, independent thought that is the threat, independent
[02:42:06.320 --> 02:42:07.320]  freedom of any kind.
[02:42:07.320 --> 02:42:08.320]  You're right.

[02:42:16.360 --> 02:42:19.400]  He correctly predicted SJWs with target founding fathers.
[02:42:19.400 --> 02:42:24.120]  They want the American flag, Thomas Jefferson, everything, the George Washington taking off
[02:42:24.120 --> 02:42:25.120]  the name of universities.
[02:42:25.120 --> 02:42:26.120]  It's all happening.
[02:42:26.120 --> 02:42:31.080]  Also, Jeff Bezos settles his divorce with his wife, Mackenzie, but keeps 75% of their
[02:42:31.080 --> 02:42:32.080]  Amazon shares.
[02:42:32.080 --> 02:42:35.200]  Well, she's going to have the wolves coming after her now.
[02:42:35.200 --> 02:42:39.960]  And then millions of Facebook users, records exposed in data breach.
[02:42:39.960 --> 02:42:44.280]  We're going to talk about what's really going on there on the other side with Bob Barnes,

[02:47:11.400 --> 02:47:25.880]  The British are coming the British are coming now the ride of Paul Revere set the nation
[02:47:25.880 --> 02:47:34.880]  on its ear and the shock that lexington heard around the world.
[02:47:34.880 --> 02:47:41.880]  To conquer march the fold to seize the arsenal there you know waiting folks searching all
[02:47:41.880 --> 02:47:42.880]  around.
[02:47:42.880 --> 02:47:47.880]  Until our militia stopped them in their tracks at the old north bridge we turned them back
[02:47:47.880 --> 02:47:54.880]  and chased those red posts back to boston town and the shot around the world was the
[02:47:54.880 --> 02:48:03.880]  start of the revolution the men men were ready on the move take your power take your gun
[02:48:03.880 --> 02:48:09.880]  hold the general washington hurry man there's not an hour to lose.
[02:48:09.880 --> 02:48:14.840]  It happened that they had planned if the british was ever to come over here that they had put
[02:48:14.840 --> 02:48:21.480]  a light up in this high church steeple and paul went down there to look and shone up there
[02:48:21.480 --> 02:48:27.360]  was the light burning brightened day well paul he jumped on his old horse and he lit
[02:48:27.360 --> 02:48:31.840]  out he didn't know where he was going but he knew he had to go somewhere oh I wish you
[02:48:31.840 --> 02:48:36.120]  could have seen it that old horse with his ears laid back in his nostrils wide open the
[02:48:36.120 --> 02:48:41.720]  sucking in wind like a jet engine feet pounding on them cobblestones striking off sparks paul
[02:48:41.720 --> 02:48:46.040]  are holding on for dear life and are hollering at the top of his lungs he says the british
[02:48:46.040 --> 02:48:52.120]  is coming the british is coming get you a gun we gonna have us a revolution and them farmers
[02:48:52.120 --> 02:48:57.480]  come up piling out of the hay like bees out of beehive minute men there's gone what's
[02:48:57.480 --> 02:49:02.280]  going on minute men there's fellas that had to be ready at a minute's notice and when
[02:49:02.280 --> 02:49:06.680]  paul comes screeching down the road that way they grabbed their guns and hid out behind
[02:49:06.680 --> 02:49:12.680]  the weeds and walls and trees and everywhere and when the british come pranks and long hall
[02:49:12.680 --> 02:49:21.120]  dressed up and in their red suits they let them have it it was a sight to see and then
[02:49:21.120 --> 02:49:29.160]  it happened they fired the gun they fired the gun and the shot was so loud it was heard
[02:49:29.160 --> 02:49:54.800]  clear around the world I thought it must be a joke when I first heard the news but it
[02:49:54.800 --> 02:50:02.280]  is in fact true cnn won the 2019 first amendment award from the radio and television digital
[02:50:02.280 --> 02:50:07.840]  news association for championing the first amendment I'd be willing to bet that the weekly
[02:50:07.840 --> 02:50:14.360]  world news grocery store tabloid came in a close second here's cnn president jeff zucker
[02:50:14.360 --> 02:50:19.940]  accepting the award and it is that first amendment which sets this country apart from
[02:50:19.940 --> 02:50:27.080]  every other is the first amendment that makes us great as we've heard here tonight this is
[02:50:27.080 --> 02:50:32.960]  an incredible time to be part of the american media not since mccarthy in the fifties and
[02:50:32.960 --> 02:50:40.280]  nixon in the seventies has journalism been so important and as carl just said it has
[02:50:40.280 --> 02:50:45.520]  never been better whether you like donald trump or you dislike donald trump the one
[02:50:45.520 --> 02:50:50.840]  thing that I think we can all agree on is that donald trump has made american journalism
[02:50:50.840 --> 02:50:55.280]  great again actually have been watching your ratings sink like a stone ever since moeller
[02:50:55.280 --> 02:50:59.640]  wrapped up his investigation in fact here are the ratings for tuesday night which show
[02:50:59.640 --> 02:51:06.320]  the jake tapeworm has dropped to 600 to 41 thousand wolf blitzer can't crack 700 thousand
[02:51:06.320 --> 02:51:16.880]  Anderson cooper's dropped to 835 thousand and none of the cnn prime time shows can get close
[02:51:16.880 --> 02:51:19.440]  to 900 thousand viewers i'm not a math person but it looks like most of the shows on fox
[02:51:19.440 --> 02:51:25.000]  news are getting triple the viewers of cnn but tell us more about how great your network
[02:51:25.000 --> 02:51:31.040]  is jeff at cnn our core mission is to tell the truth to hold those in power accountable
[02:51:31.040 --> 02:51:36.960]  even when it's uncomfortable especially when it's uncomfortable maybe we're being too hard
[02:51:36.960 --> 02:51:41.760]  on cnn maybe they've decided to turn over a new leaf since they've been proven wrong
[02:51:41.760 --> 02:51:45.920]  about everything for the last two years and instead of lobbying social media companies
[02:51:45.920 --> 02:51:50.920]  to ban people maybe they are supporting the first amendment now of course locker up was
[02:51:50.920 --> 02:51:58.520]  a feature of the 2016 um trump campaign do you in retrospect wish that people like yourself
[02:51:58.520 --> 02:52:03.880]  ahead of the fb i i mean the people in charge of law and order had shut down that language
[02:52:03.880 --> 02:52:09.040]  that it was dangerous potentially that it could have created violence that it's kind
[02:52:09.040 --> 02:52:14.880]  of hate speech should that have been allowed that's not a role for government to play the
[02:52:14.880 --> 02:52:19.400]  beauty of this country is people can say what they want even if it's misleading and and
[02:52:19.400 --> 02:52:25.160]  it's demagoguery the people should have shut it down were republicans who understand the
[02:52:25.160 --> 02:52:30.080]  rule of law and the values that they claim to stand for shame on them but it wasn't a
[02:52:30.080 --> 02:52:34.760]  role for government to play that is cnn's chief international correspondent christian
[02:52:34.760 --> 02:52:40.820]  oman pour asking the former head of the fb i why he didn't arrest american citizens for
[02:52:40.820 --> 02:52:46.760]  chanting lock her up at trump rallies about hillary clinton while cnn you sure do deserve
[02:52:46.760 --> 02:52:55.600]  that first amendment award it's powerful reports up on info wars dot com news wars dot com and
[02:52:55.600 --> 02:52:59.360]  mark dice dot com that's mark dice dot com bob barnes we've only got you five minutes the
[02:52:59.360 --> 02:53:03.920]  next hour and then our ali alexander's taken over to do a great job it's so great to have
[02:53:03.920 --> 02:53:06.840]  you here in town as our chief legal counsel at least one week out of the month i'm glad
[02:53:06.840 --> 02:53:13.400]  you're making that time and co hosting with us this same bullying that she's putting out
[02:53:13.400 --> 02:53:19.800]  again is is is is illustrative of how dangerous these people are as they lose which they're
[02:53:19.800 --> 02:53:24.560]  doing disagree with me if i'm wrong what are they going to do next i think you're gonna
[02:53:24.560 --> 02:53:27.840]  see the acceleration of effort so you see and you see someone like her putting out the
[02:53:27.840 --> 02:53:31.560]  idea that maybe we should arrest people for voicing opinions and speech that we don't
[02:53:31.560 --> 02:53:37.240]  like you see the discussion about creating regulatory agencies to monitor the press that's
[02:53:37.240 --> 02:53:40.760]  ultimately going to be captive by the big press made is one of my arguments forever
[02:53:40.760 --> 02:53:44.640]  with ralph nader when my old clients was anytime you create a government agency it's not going
[02:53:44.640 --> 02:53:47.760]  to regulate the big entities it's going to be captured by the big entities and run the
[02:53:47.760 --> 02:53:50.920]  little guy out of town and that's what's always happened and that's what's going to happen
[02:53:50.920 --> 02:53:55.920]  so they're going to look to more statist solutions as they can't win in the battle of public
[02:53:55.920 --> 02:54:00.040]  arena as they can't win and and succeed at their suppression and censorship that they're
[02:54:00.040 --> 02:54:03.760]  trying as as they can't get the audience to run away as they can't get the audience to
[02:54:03.760 --> 02:54:08.240]  be so scared and afraid that they don't support places like info wars their only solution is
[02:54:08.240 --> 02:54:12.320]  going to be to ratchet up the status role and ratchet up the status involvement and
[02:54:12.320 --> 02:54:16.440]  I love how they ignore history because anytime you do that with this level of resistance
[02:54:16.440 --> 02:54:20.600]  it doesn't go well no it doesn't and what they underestimate is the power of the American
[02:54:20.600 --> 02:54:23.880]  people in the independent mind what they've been underestimating since like the power
[02:54:23.880 --> 02:54:28.560]  of your script said friend you know for almost 200 plus years they underestimate the independence
[02:54:28.560 --> 02:54:32.280]  of the American mind the independence of the American people the independence of thought
[02:54:32.280 --> 02:54:35.880]  the independence of ideas people will not be dictated to what they need to believe in
[02:54:35.880 --> 02:54:40.960]  what they will do and by the way the the revolution a war of the six years we lost everything
[02:54:40.960 --> 02:54:45.680]  until basically the last year except for Trenton but it didn't matter because people weren't
[02:54:45.680 --> 02:54:49.800]  giving up they weren't giving in and it's so decimated the British army and the Germans
[02:54:49.800 --> 02:54:53.680]  they brought in the Hessians that they lost more troops here and they lost some major
[02:54:53.680 --> 02:54:57.720]  wars against the French they had to give up and that's why I coined the term resistance
[02:54:57.720 --> 02:55:02.640]  is victory if you just resist and stay alive you win absolutely it's what if the reason
[02:55:02.640 --> 02:55:06.480]  why our national anthem is a star step spangled banner it's not the best song song in the
[02:55:06.480 --> 02:55:11.160]  world is not the best allure it's about a fort getting bombarded but they stayed there
[02:55:11.160 --> 02:55:15.080]  exactly it's probably the only anthem where it's celebrating getting defeated and it's
[02:55:15.080 --> 02:55:18.360]  saying because you're not defeated in your mind you're not defeated in your heart you're
[02:55:18.360 --> 02:55:22.040]  not defeated in your spirit you're not defeated in your soul you're never defeated and I've
[02:55:22.040 --> 02:55:28.440]  seen the Smithsonian that flag shot to ribbons and it's the most powerful American flag absolutely
[02:55:28.440 --> 02:55:31.440]  because it says as long as your heart it's sort of like a Hemingway story the old man
[02:55:31.440 --> 02:55:35.760]  in the sea he's you know he goes out he hasn't got a fish for 51 days he finally gets one
[02:55:35.760 --> 02:55:39.240]  and the sharks are attacking him precisely and he's trying to make it back he hits the
[02:55:39.240 --> 02:55:43.840]  victory but then the sharks come it's a metaphor for success precisely but he conquers it in
[02:55:43.840 --> 02:55:48.760]  the end because he did it and he even talks about he he raised the the sale like the tattered
[02:55:48.760 --> 02:55:53.280]  flag of defeat to wage war with the sea once more that as long as you have that power in
[02:55:53.280 --> 02:55:57.800]  that passion this is the essence exactly liberty cannot die unless you let it die oh my god
[02:55:57.800 --> 02:56:02.040]  it's so beautiful and I keep saying I'm gonna play this clip and we never get to it we'll
[02:56:02.040 --> 02:56:06.360]  come back and play it about the poor Jewish man being attacked by this lady but she lost
[02:56:06.360 --> 02:56:11.160]  her job not him everything she said was gonna happen to him and there's a real backfire for
[02:56:11.160 --> 02:56:16.280]  two years the police let left us beat everybody up now they're arresting him everywhere there's
[02:56:16.280 --> 02:56:20.880]  like a group decision there wasn't some order came down there's been a decision that they're
[02:56:20.880 --> 02:56:25.200]  gonna that this is wrong and I really see the dominoes following us the enemy Bob because
[02:56:25.200 --> 02:56:29.120]  the ordinary person even people on the left recognize that what is wrong is what is wrong
[02:56:29.120 --> 02:56:31.760]  and they're seeing the suppression they're seeing this censorship they're seeing this
[02:56:31.760 --> 02:56:35.600]  overreaction by people in the statist part of the left it's what's driven people like
[02:56:35.600 --> 02:56:39.800]  Dave Rubin away from the left entirely and there's a larger and more people people like
[02:56:39.800 --> 02:56:43.680]  Joe Rogan that when they see if they're like this is insanity I'm not will I'm not signing
[02:56:43.680 --> 02:56:46.920]  up for that one after Joe is I knew he knew the truth and I want him to make the right
[02:56:46.920 --> 02:56:50.880]  decision and I didn't bully him into it he was like you're right I was busy and wasn't
[02:56:50.880 --> 02:56:54.720]  paying attention this is wrong he's more popular than ever going after the power structure
[02:56:54.720 --> 02:56:57.800]  and now they're attacking him calling him a white supremacist what do you think that
[02:56:57.800 --> 02:57:02.200]  does it makes Joe come more to our side they think like something like Joe oh you were
[02:57:02.200 --> 02:57:07.480]  being nice to left because we attack you because we attacked you oh now it's the opposite
[02:57:07.480 --> 02:57:12.000]  exactly the status collectivist left exposes their true selves when they behave in this
[02:57:12.000 --> 02:57:17.480]  way and they're they're getting the the American spirit is continuing to reassert itself against
[02:57:17.480 --> 02:57:22.160]  this attempt to suppress and oppress it by people with institutional influence and power
[02:57:22.160 --> 02:57:26.600]  I want to quantify we come back what is the American spirit then we'll play this clip
[02:57:26.600 --> 02:57:30.760]  I promise and then Ali Alexander is coming up I can talk 10 hours a day with Bob Barnes
[02:57:30.760 --> 02:57:36.040]  I love this guy I'm so glad like months ago I said hey Daria that guy is awesome I've
[02:57:36.040 --> 02:57:40.640]  heard him before he worked on Wesley Snipes case get him on and we got him and now he's
[02:57:40.640 --> 02:57:48.200]  a fixture around here stay with us if you're not expanding you're imploding there is no
[02:57:48.200 --> 02:57:53.160]  set stasis there is no managed system there is no uncontenual the continuum is always
[02:57:53.160 --> 02:57:58.880]  launching forward in the future so you support us and get creative and get fired up we won't
[02:57:58.880 --> 02:58:01.840]  just be here a hundred years we'll be here forever we'll turn the whole thing around
[02:58:01.840 --> 02:58:06.760]  our grandchildren on Mars bases and jump bases and God knows what are going to look back and
[02:58:06.760 --> 02:58:11.920]  say you know we struggled here we made it and that's really where this goes God's got
[02:58:11.920 --> 02:58:16.000]  a big war for you ready and so if you can't face George Soros and Hillary Clinton and
[02:58:16.000 --> 02:58:20.480]  Adolf Hitler and Mao Zedong are you going to really be able to face the other stuff
[02:58:20.480 --> 02:58:24.800]  because God wants warriors that are smart and are ready to build things and are also
[02:58:24.800 --> 02:58:28.200]  ready to fight you don't go to the next level without getting a big weight put on your back
[02:58:28.200 --> 02:58:32.240]  and I mean I don't know what's going to happen to me in the future I mean all I know is I
[02:58:32.240 --> 02:58:37.040]  want to go with the master built I want to go to the next level I want to be with the
[02:58:37.040 --> 02:58:41.600]  spirit that I've experienced not these devil worshipers they're cold and failed and feels

[03:00:23.720 --> 03:00:34.600]  the stars this is a pro human transmission I'm your host Bob Barnes ride shotgun by this
[03:00:34.600 --> 03:00:40.520]  Bob you were making some great points during the break just about the affliction of the
[03:00:40.520 --> 03:00:46.040]  establishment in their mindset and how they operate but I want to play this clip because
[03:00:46.040 --> 03:00:52.560]  most of the time this is how it ends up but whether it's me and Lucy fried chicken or
[03:00:52.560 --> 03:00:57.240]  whether it's I'm down at the bait over thing and the events over and so security goes hey
[03:00:57.240 --> 03:01:03.440]  let's go it's over they said Jones ran from the bait to rally no I stood against those
[03:01:03.440 --> 03:01:08.560]  anti Americans come the police had to come protect us but then when it was over I left
[03:01:08.560 --> 03:01:13.320]  but they're all about you left we won it's our territory it's very infantile well this
[03:01:13.320 --> 03:01:17.720]  poor Jewish man wears his make America great again had here's the local news story in Palo
[03:01:17.720 --> 03:01:24.360]  Alto California you know America's still a free country right Victor F is a 74 year old
[03:01:24.360 --> 03:01:29.600]  Trump supporter who lives in Palo Alto he casually went about his business today still sporting
[03:01:29.600 --> 03:01:35.240]  the red mega hat that prompted a loud confrontation with a woman at a Palo Alto Starbucks two days
[03:01:35.240 --> 03:01:40.480]  ago this crazy woman came over started raving at me she turned to the rest of star hey everybody
[03:01:40.480 --> 03:01:47.080]  here's this racist here he hates brown people he's crazy he's a Nazi and so forth the woman
[03:01:47.080 --> 03:01:52.560]  Rebecca Parker Mankey then began taking photos and posting about it on her Facebook saying
[03:01:52.560 --> 03:01:57.880]  she was going to shame him get him fired kicked out of clubs and march up and down his street
[03:01:57.880 --> 03:02:03.120]  Victor says she left then came back and tried to rile the Starbucks crowd once more hey
[03:02:03.120 --> 03:02:07.200]  again everybody here this racist and so on and then as she wrote in her thing she was
[03:02:07.200 --> 03:02:11.720]  disappointed all the people didn't come and mob me in fact the opposite happened people
[03:02:11.720 --> 03:02:16.640]  started harassing Parker Mankey's family and pause back it up five seconds no they started
[03:02:16.640 --> 03:02:23.960]  standing up to her she says bankrupt him destroy him get him they stood against a monster let's
[03:02:23.960 --> 03:02:29.880]  continue in fact the opposite happened people started harassing Parker Mankey's family and
[03:02:29.880 --> 03:02:34.720]  her employer Griffin stringed instruments where she worked as an accountant the store owner
[03:02:34.720 --> 03:02:40.600]  decided to fire her after he read her Facebook posts we feel that music is what brings people
[03:02:40.600 --> 03:02:48.720]  together and so having someone then making comments that are divisive is just not consistent
[03:02:48.720 --> 03:02:53.480]  with our values no one answered the door at Parker Mankey's home but a female spoke through
[03:02:53.480 --> 03:02:58.000]  a closed window saying Rebecca doesn't live here she didn't want to discuss the issues
[03:02:58.000 --> 03:03:03.440]  with me she wanted just to scream about Nazis and saw it Victor wears a yarmulke underneath
[03:03:03.440 --> 03:03:09.480]  his mega hat he is Jewish and so to him being called a Nazi is hurtful people with an education
[03:03:09.480 --> 03:03:12.880]  should know better than to say stupid things like that that's enough of the report yeah
[03:03:12.880 --> 03:03:16.720]  America beat the Nazis so this whole of tip of the left but it shows how we're coming
[03:03:16.720 --> 03:03:20.720]  to your house you're gonna lose your job it all happened to her and the same thing happened
[03:03:20.720 --> 03:03:25.440]  they banned the people that assault attacked me verbally from the fried chicken place for
[03:03:25.440 --> 03:03:30.440]  life I was just leaving but they spun that I was kicked out and that I started the fight
[03:03:30.440 --> 03:03:34.920]  none of that's true but again in the real world they're failing absolutely because ordinary
[03:03:34.920 --> 03:03:38.760]  Americans don't want to have anything to do with suppression of speech don't want to have
[03:03:38.760 --> 03:03:42.200]  anything to do with censorship don't want to have anything to do with trying to ostracize
[03:03:42.200 --> 03:03:46.800]  people based on their political belief structure ordinary Americans enjoy the public debate
[03:03:46.800 --> 03:03:50.680]  the public arena we helped create it we helped enshrine it for the entire world so we're
[03:03:50.680 --> 03:03:54.240]  not going to walk away from it because a couple of leftist or status or people who've grown
[03:03:54.240 --> 03:03:57.640]  up in a safe space culture think they have the right to use their collective economic
[03:03:57.640 --> 03:04:02.120]  social cultural or political power to suppress and oppress their ability to express and have
[03:04:02.120 --> 03:04:05.880]  free speech in America with the country that founded it and the and is the foundational
[03:04:05.880 --> 03:04:09.840]  freedom right I mean we gave birth to this puppy we're not going to give it up precisely
[03:04:09.840 --> 03:04:13.400]  we lit the flame of liberty and we're not going to let it die out because somebody doesn't
[03:04:13.400 --> 03:04:17.640]  like the nature of its expression or it's a but isn't it biblical that the very people
[03:04:17.640 --> 03:04:22.360]  trying to kill the flame are going to take it from a dim thing to a blowtorch oh precisely
[03:04:22.360 --> 03:04:26.000]  a flame thrower I mean it's extraordinary I mean that their desire to use collectivist
[03:04:26.000 --> 03:04:30.080]  power to suppress and oppress speech is the greatest threat to democracy and freedom in
[03:04:30.080 --> 03:04:35.800]  the country and in the world today Robert Barnes thank you for the time Ali Alexander
[03:04:35.800 --> 03:04:39.840]  is taking over on the other side of this break you're about to get on that chair playing

[03:04:55.000 --> 03:05:01.480]  the eugenicists are always talking down to us they're always trying to make us feel small
[03:05:01.480 --> 03:05:06.560]  to feel insignificant they try to censor because they fear you and don't want you to have the
[03:05:06.560 --> 03:05:12.280]  right to access information so you can make your own decisions they want you to believe
[03:05:12.280 --> 03:05:19.160]  you're powerless but the truth is it is we the people and our ideas and our actions and
[03:05:19.160 --> 03:05:24.680]  what we say and what we do that changes the world we are the power structure we are the
[03:05:24.680 --> 03:05:33.160]  inventors we are the trailblazers and the globalists understand that and they understand that they
[03:05:33.160 --> 03:05:38.720]  are basically trying to control and steal the future from we the people now to help
[03:05:38.720 --> 03:05:42.840]  fund our operation it's undoubtedly the very tip of the spear against these globalists
[03:05:42.840 --> 03:05:47.080]  I want to encourage listeners and viewers understand that throughout the second half
[03:05:47.080 --> 03:05:50.700]  of the month of March we're going to have store-wide free shipping at fifty percent

[03:06:07.080 --> 03:06:16.920]  is obedience to god it's alex jones howdy folks this is ollie alexander i'm filling
[03:06:16.920 --> 03:06:23.480]  in for alex jones here on info wars dot com we're all across the nation is pretty exciting
[03:06:23.480 --> 03:06:29.280]  to tune back in with all of you i gotta slow down the show a little bit we're talking about
[03:06:29.280 --> 03:06:34.040]  the decline of america but i want to talk about a parallel in our history one that happened
[03:06:34.040 --> 03:06:41.040]  51 years ago we lost reverend martin luther king jr what i've asked the staff to do in
[03:06:41.040 --> 03:06:45.760]  addition we're gonna take a lot of calls we're gonna take a bunch of bunch of calls but we're
[03:06:45.760 --> 03:06:52.520]  gonna play martin luther king's last sermon it was called i've been to the mountaintop
[03:06:52.520 --> 03:06:59.000]  it was actually 51 years ago and one night that was the previous night and then he was
[03:06:59.000 --> 03:07:05.600]  tragically taken from us what is missing from our history books often when we're conditioned
[03:07:05.600 --> 03:07:12.420]  in middle school and high school is that the fb i harassed martin luther king jr hoover
[03:07:12.420 --> 03:07:18.480]  answered to no president and sought to have martin luther king his sins used against
[03:07:18.480 --> 03:07:23.720]  him they tried to get him to commit suicide and they may have actually actually actually
[03:07:23.720 --> 03:07:30.480]  been complicit in allowing a gunman to gun him down so what i'm gonna ask the staff to
[03:07:30.480 --> 03:07:34.640]  do is we're gonna play about this four or five minute speech of martin luther king
[03:07:34.640 --> 03:07:40.360]  it's the most impactful speech i watch it once every other month and it really you know
[03:07:40.360 --> 03:07:45.040]  i hope i don't end up crying on air but i'm not above it what we're gonna do is we're
[03:07:45.040 --> 03:07:50.840]  gonna stop the speech several times and i want to explain how you know in my opinion
[03:07:50.840 --> 03:07:58.440]  in god's time it took a black man it took a southern man it took a christian man it
[03:07:58.440 --> 03:08:06.040]  took somebody who was conservative in their values and liberal in their politics to really
[03:08:06.040 --> 03:08:10.080]  bring this nation to the fulfillment of its promise and actually a fulfillment that the
[03:08:10.080 --> 03:08:15.800]  founders wanted you know if you know your history the three-fifths compromise was a ticking
[03:08:15.800 --> 03:08:22.160]  time bomb that one day black americans could have their full freedom they first had to
[03:08:22.160 --> 03:08:26.120]  be counted as something and a lot of people don't know that they don't teach us that in
[03:08:26.120 --> 03:08:31.560]  our history books so from the left you hear martin luther king was this and that and this
[03:08:31.560 --> 03:08:36.600]  and then even from the far right they criticized revin martin luther king jr and say well you
[03:08:36.600 --> 03:08:43.600]  know he attended some marxist classes yes but he disavowed them and disavowed russia
[03:08:43.600 --> 03:08:47.400]  and i again i want to bring this back to j. edgar hoover and james comey and what they
[03:08:47.400 --> 03:08:51.960]  are doing to president donald day trump because i think that president trump needs to go after
[03:08:51.960 --> 03:09:00.080]  these people who have suppressed his civil rights have maliciously persecuted and prosecuted
[03:09:00.080 --> 03:09:05.040]  his allies simply because he won so let's go ahead and play that speech i've been to
[03:09:05.040 --> 03:09:12.240]  the mountaintop by martin luther king jr all we say to america is be true to what you
[03:09:12.240 --> 03:09:30.640]  said on paper i live in china or even russia any totalitarian country maybe i could understand
[03:09:30.640 --> 03:09:35.720]  some of these illegal injunctions now let's stop it here let's stop this one right here
[03:09:35.720 --> 03:09:38.960]  i want people to understand what he's talking about because this is actually happening all
[03:09:38.960 --> 03:09:45.000]  over america right now two things worth referencing is martin luther king acknowledged that the
[03:09:45.000 --> 03:09:51.000]  commies were totalitarian that they were leftist they were socialists they centralized things
[03:09:51.000 --> 03:09:57.280]  just to oppress people and what he also talked about is what is it frankly a legal epidemic
[03:09:57.280 --> 03:10:02.040]  in the country right now you have judges handing down what are called preliminary injunctions
[03:10:02.040 --> 03:10:08.000]  they seek to silence bloggers and tweeters before a case is even heard they want you stop
[03:10:08.000 --> 03:10:14.240]  stop stop don't tweet about that stop stop stop don't blog about that and it's the same
[03:10:14.240 --> 03:10:18.360]  thing that you find many of our social media companies are doing and what martin luther
[03:10:18.360 --> 03:10:24.200]  king jr said is we're going to civilly disobey y'all we're not going to engage with the black
[03:10:24.200 --> 03:10:30.760]  panthers we're not going to engage with malcolm x's nation of islam louis fair con is now in
[03:10:30.760 --> 03:10:38.520]  charge of that black islam islamic sect here in america no no no we're going to engage
[03:10:38.520 --> 03:10:45.880]  civilly but if you tell us that we can't invoke our natural rights if we can't curb these
[03:10:45.880 --> 03:10:50.960]  natural rights into silver rights then we're just going to disobey them that sounds like
[03:10:50.960 --> 03:10:54.240]  a liberty lover to me let's keep playing that speech
[03:10:54.240 --> 03:11:01.440]  i have a certain basic first amendment privileges because they have committed themselves to
[03:11:01.440 --> 03:11:10.880]  that over that but somewhere around of the freedom of assembly somewhere around of the
[03:11:10.880 --> 03:11:21.040]  freedom of speech of the freedom of press somewhere around that the greatness of america
[03:11:21.040 --> 03:11:29.240]  is the right to protest far right now here's where we have to acknowledge right the far
[03:11:29.240 --> 03:11:34.720]  right in america was keeping the fulfillment of our promises we got to stop the tape so
[03:11:34.720 --> 03:11:40.440]  that we can come back to it but the far right was preventing a lot of this but it wasn't
[03:11:40.440 --> 03:11:45.920]  just the far right see they've rewritten history again it was the new york times it was the
[03:11:45.920 --> 03:11:50.920]  washington post it was all of the media the whole of the media during world war two was
[03:11:50.920 --> 03:11:56.000]  anti-semitic the whole of the media during the silver rights movement was against the
[03:11:56.000 --> 03:12:01.360]  silver rights and now what they've done is i mean they've really made down up and up
[03:12:01.360 --> 03:12:06.720]  down but it's worth noting that what did what did martin luther king jr. say instead of
[03:12:06.720 --> 03:12:14.440]  acting like a black separatist or a black nationalist he invoked our bill of rights these bill of
[03:12:14.440 --> 03:12:21.160]  rights came from whom well the people who are skeptical of a big federal government
[03:12:21.160 --> 03:12:27.200]  the thomas jefferson's the liberty lovers dare i say the conservatives the liberals
[03:12:27.200 --> 03:12:33.040]  or the libertarians of what would be now and this is really really fascinating that in
[03:12:33.040 --> 03:12:39.960]  a time where some blacks considered going back to africa other blacks considered migrating
[03:12:39.960 --> 03:12:46.000]  to chicago or taking over cities like you know atlanta or whatever martin luther king said
[03:12:46.000 --> 03:12:52.040]  no no no we can all get together with our founding principles that's not what we see
[03:12:52.040 --> 03:12:57.280]  out of black lives matter today that's not the defense the rigorous defense of the bill
[03:12:57.280 --> 03:13:03.640]  of rights that we hear from the press no they're all too eager to d platform info wars dot
[03:13:03.640 --> 03:13:09.880]  com they're all too eager to chant let's take down these monuments to great men with big
[03:13:09.880 --> 03:13:15.200]  flaws no martin luther king in his speech that he's about to say now is is he wants
[03:13:15.200 --> 03:13:22.680]  to fulfill those promises be true to the words that you wrote on paper is what he's about
[03:13:22.680 --> 03:13:29.600]  to say let's keep playing that tape so just as i say we aren't gonna let any dogs or water

[03:20:24.480 --> 03:20:30.800]  but we're in church today aren't we folks it's been 51 years since the tragic shooting
[03:20:30.800 --> 03:20:38.600]  to this day of reverend doctor martin luther king jr a black man a southern man a christian
[03:20:38.600 --> 03:20:46.560]  man someone who endorsed nationalism and rejected separatism and segregation we're studying
[03:20:46.560 --> 03:20:55.040]  the speech he gave 51 years and one day to this date i've been to the mountaintop and
[03:20:55.040 --> 03:21:00.320]  we're parsing through the speech and we're coming up to a really emotional part if you
[03:21:00.320 --> 03:21:06.320]  studied any history because not only is he a spiritual man who feels that his time is
[03:21:06.320 --> 03:21:13.720]  coming to an end but he was being harassed by the fbi and a lot of people didn't know
[03:21:13.720 --> 03:21:17.800]  that we're going to bring up all those images but in the part of the speech that we just
[03:21:17.800 --> 03:21:22.480]  covered and we are going to take calls i can see i mean all of our lines are filled up
[03:21:22.480 --> 03:21:27.080]  i really actually did not expect this i thought i was going to have to plug the number more
[03:21:27.080 --> 03:21:32.920]  than i have and it looks like i plugged it too much we're too popular um but but and
[03:21:32.920 --> 03:21:38.200]  then we're also going to have cj pierce and call in he is a young black 16 year old out
[03:21:38.200 --> 03:21:43.880]  of august of georgia you guys have seen him all over lame fox news he's actually been
[03:21:43.880 --> 03:21:46.920]  here on info wars everywhere you guys have seen him everywhere we're going to talk about
[03:21:46.920 --> 03:21:54.080]  this and but but in this part of the speech king says i have been in the mountaintop
[03:21:54.080 --> 03:22:00.480]  and i don't know what's going to happen to me he was referencing moses coming down with
[03:22:00.480 --> 03:22:09.040]  the tablets the people are rebellious and restless and they can't find the promise land and instead
[03:22:09.040 --> 03:22:14.840]  of god coming down with instructions to find a physical promise land he gives them instructions
[03:22:14.840 --> 03:22:20.800]  that they might renew their promise to him right their promise to him by his commandments
[03:22:20.800 --> 03:22:25.480]  let's keep rolling that speech a little bit and then we're gonna we're gonna uh we'll
[03:22:25.480 --> 03:22:29.040]  keep going through this thing and then we'll jump over to paul we'll jump over to cj and
[03:22:29.040 --> 03:22:30.800]  we'll keep rolling
[03:22:30.800 --> 03:22:42.800]  like anybody i would like to live a long life longevity has its place but i'm not concerned
[03:22:42.800 --> 03:22:51.800]  about that now i just want to do god's will and he's allowed me to go up to the mountain
[03:22:51.800 --> 03:23:04.160]  and i've looked over and i've seen the promise land i may not get that with you but i want
[03:23:04.160 --> 03:23:12.840]  you to know the night that we as a people will get to the promise land
[03:23:12.840 --> 03:23:21.360]  now how how magnificent is that how magnificent is that here's what you don't know what you
[03:23:21.360 --> 03:23:30.160]  don't know is that for the past week or two mlk had gotten threatening calls that were
[03:23:30.160 --> 03:23:36.480]  seemingly anonymous it turns out it was our government it was the federal bureau of investigations
[03:23:36.480 --> 03:23:44.800]  under direct orders from j. edgar hoover to harass the reverend now see martin luther
[03:23:44.800 --> 03:23:53.360]  king had slipped into natural sense like any man he it is reported that he had committed
[03:23:53.360 --> 03:24:05.320]  adultery he had dishonored his faithful wife coretta scott king she knew but the fbi sought
[03:24:05.320 --> 03:24:10.200]  to ruin this man they threatened this man in a series of letters harassing phone calls
[03:24:10.200 --> 03:24:18.280]  notes and even while his phones were wiretapped and mlk got death threats the fbi didn't do
[03:24:18.280 --> 03:24:24.040]  anything to protect his life i'm under the belief that they knew he was gonna die that
[03:24:24.040 --> 03:24:30.840]  next day after that speech i'm under the belief that mlk jr knew he was gonna die that next
[03:24:30.840 --> 03:24:38.120]  day after that speech and he chose to commit himself wholly to god he had his sins he had
[03:24:38.120 --> 03:24:45.720]  his markings he had dishonored his family in his ministry but for the care of the world
[03:24:45.720 --> 03:24:52.800]  and his mission and his purpose he committed to do what he was going to do flaws and all
[03:24:52.800 --> 03:24:59.560]  honoring his god and honoring his purpose and and how many times have we heard that from
[03:24:59.560 --> 03:25:07.200]  alex jones how many times have you heard that from the late great andrew bright part we're
[03:25:07.200 --> 03:25:12.480]  not on a suicide mission we're not common causes but we serve a higher purpose we are
[03:25:12.480 --> 03:25:19.920]  actually the people advocating peace by wanting to correct the press let's bring on a young
[03:25:19.920 --> 03:25:27.680]  black man cj piercen is on the line and maybe we can also get his photo up uh cj how how's
[03:25:27.680 --> 03:25:35.880]  this uh 51 years later you're in the state where mlk had his ministry you're on the right
[03:25:35.880 --> 03:25:44.480]  how's it feel oh okay he said god he's on standby okay so let's try to cycle him in the meantime
[03:25:44.480 --> 03:25:51.480]  let's take paul paul in vegas how are you i'm doing good how about yourself thanks for
[03:25:51.480 --> 03:25:56.960]  taking my call yeah of course martin luther king one of the things they were most scared
[03:25:56.960 --> 03:26:02.200]  about he was bringing the families together he was bringing the mother and the father making
[03:26:02.200 --> 03:26:07.200]  sure that it was a strong family union and uh they knew that they they had a plan against
[03:26:07.200 --> 03:26:12.360]  that they were trying to you know give civilists in the military and they were doing that different
[03:26:12.360 --> 03:26:16.480]  different programs actually to break the families up and that's one of the things they were
[03:26:16.480 --> 03:26:22.920]  scared about about martin luther king is that he was unifying the family yeah paul i couldn't
[03:26:22.920 --> 03:26:29.600]  agree with you more thanks for calling in paul is absolutely right is that the social welfare
[03:26:29.600 --> 03:26:39.720]  system and not only that academia healthcare all of it has what demolished poor poor whites
[03:26:39.720 --> 03:26:46.080]  poor blacks and because a disproportionate black people live in property it is disproportionately
[03:26:46.080 --> 03:26:51.800]  affected black people let's bring cj pierce and on we finally have him on cj do you agree
[03:26:51.800 --> 03:26:56.720]  do you think that there is a war on the black family do you think that this is the main cause
[03:26:56.720 --> 03:27:02.560]  for the ailments in black america undoubtedly holly i believe that there is an absolute
[03:27:02.560 --> 03:27:07.040]  war being waged against the black community against the black family every single day
[03:27:07.040 --> 03:27:11.280]  by those in a lot i think it's evident not only in the example you sided with martin
[03:27:11.280 --> 03:27:16.160]  luther king but also if we look further it's more recent history if we look at what happened
[03:27:16.160 --> 03:27:20.000]  during the nineties with the clinton crime bill was disproportionately but black fathers
[03:27:20.000 --> 03:27:27.360]  behind bars and when she yeah and when she referred to black men and children as super
[03:27:27.360 --> 03:27:32.560]  predator like this is the way that they talk about black people openly and still somehow
[03:27:32.560 --> 03:27:38.560]  some way we still con ourselves into believing that they actually care about us they care
[03:27:38.560 --> 03:27:42.600]  about black people they care about our struggle they care about our plight but they are the
[03:27:42.600 --> 03:27:47.320]  reason that we do struggle they are the reason that that plight even exists if you look at
[03:27:47.320 --> 03:27:51.840]  that one of the johnson's so-called great decided which is supposed to end racial disparity
[03:27:51.840 --> 03:27:56.400]  and lift america out of poverty all it did was worse in the black community to create
[03:27:56.400 --> 03:28:02.640]  a culture of dependency and that's not independent that is not progress of anything that is shooting
[03:28:02.640 --> 03:28:08.080]  us in the kneecap and saying i hope you're okay i hope you make it like that is how
[03:28:08.080 --> 03:28:12.920]  the left has treated black people for decades and then in fact the matter is that we now
[03:28:12.920 --> 03:28:17.720]  finally have a president who is a fought for black people unlike any president we've had
[03:28:17.720 --> 03:28:22.680]  in modern history this time the first act which is reformed our criminal justice system
[03:28:22.680 --> 03:28:26.600]  we've the lowest like an employer at your nation's history more black people own homes

[03:33:28.880 --> 03:33:37.800]  cha cha cha cha cha but we're actually in a somber mood 51 years ago today reverend
[03:33:37.800 --> 03:33:52.560]  dr martin luther king jr was taken from us by a gunman who knew the fb i the fb i knew
[03:33:52.560 --> 03:33:59.160]  there's been a war on black families as our caller paul alluded to as i'm elaborating
[03:33:59.160 --> 03:34:05.840]  and a good friend of mine is actually on the line cj pierce one of the young brilliant
[03:34:05.840 --> 03:34:11.800]  supporters of donald j trump and he was actually talking about right before the break donald
[03:34:11.800 --> 03:34:17.880]  trump's record with the black people i'm impressed with it cj's impressed with it confession
[03:34:17.880 --> 03:34:26.320]  neither cj or i pick donald trump is our first string player during the primary of 2016 but
[03:34:26.320 --> 03:34:33.840]  we both ended up on his team before the election in 2016 and boy did we score big and we score
[03:34:33.840 --> 03:34:39.560]  big for the black community cj tell the listeners why you as a black man forget you as a conservative
[03:34:39.560 --> 03:34:44.080]  forget you as a christian forget you as a regular american don't you don't you feel a little
[03:34:44.080 --> 03:34:48.560]  pride that you were right that you can go tell your black friends whose parents are voting
[03:34:48.560 --> 03:34:54.720]  democrat like i bet on the guy who's helping our people which is uniting america in turn
[03:34:54.720 --> 03:35:00.760]  for sure and leaves me beaming with jolly holly because i think so many people going to this
[03:35:00.760 --> 03:35:04.200]  election i remember all the conspiracy theories that the election of donald trump was going
[03:35:04.200 --> 03:35:09.720]  to lead to black people going back into slavery as going back to africa and all these crazy
[03:35:09.720 --> 03:35:15.200]  things but what we have is back in chains that's what that's what you're going back and saying
[03:35:15.200 --> 03:35:21.040]  put you back in chains yeah yeah it's ridiculous but what we've actually seen is that black
[03:35:21.040 --> 03:35:25.440]  unemployment is at a record low more black people are owning homes than ever before black
[03:35:25.440 --> 03:35:31.160]  wages are increasing incredibly rapidly like the black community is thriving and so when
[03:35:31.160 --> 03:35:35.920]  i go into the black community when i talk to other people at the barber shop or at church
[03:35:35.920 --> 03:35:39.960]  you know the thing that i always go to say is that you cannot argue with the fact that
[03:35:39.960 --> 03:35:44.520]  the black community the state of our community is stronger than it was four years before
[03:35:44.520 --> 03:35:49.440]  now but it was stronger than it was during the obama administration and so the thing
[03:35:49.440 --> 03:35:54.320]  is that i'm confident in the argument and what i believe is that at the end of the day
[03:35:54.320 --> 03:35:58.680]  black people may not be you know as passionate and as a spoken about their support of the
[03:35:58.680 --> 03:36:03.720]  president as me and you are and others like kanda so-and-so but i think it goes back to
[03:36:03.720 --> 03:36:08.920]  that fundamental truth that james carville spoke of you know back during our election
[03:36:08.920 --> 03:36:15.120]  it's the economy stupid right black people are thriving economically more than they have
[03:36:15.120 --> 03:36:19.320]  in decades and i think that that is going to be at the front of their minds in 2020
[03:36:19.320 --> 03:36:25.080]  i'm excited about what that means for the election yeah cj he put a hundred billion
[03:36:25.080 --> 03:36:31.840]  dollars that's a b billion and we know that the president loves to say billion just like
[03:36:31.840 --> 03:36:37.840]  china you know it's like but no he put a hundred billion dollars back in the black yeah back
[03:36:37.840 --> 03:36:42.680]  into the black community through the hbc use and the economic empowerment zones this is
[03:36:42.680 --> 03:36:50.000]  a man who cares about all americans and equal opportunity but he knows that america has
[03:36:50.000 --> 03:36:54.560]  robbed its promise from the black people he talked about this on the campaign trail in
[03:36:54.560 --> 03:37:01.640]  detroit in charlotte he went into black communities in october of 2016 and he championed this what
[03:37:01.640 --> 03:37:04.960]  i want to do is i want to play the rest of mlk's speech and then i want to talk to you
[03:37:04.960 --> 03:37:12.040]  about the fb i targeting trump and how that feels like a lot to me the fb i targeting
[03:37:12.040 --> 03:37:21.040]  mlk can we play the rest of that video team so i'm happy tonight i'm not worried about
[03:37:21.040 --> 03:37:31.960]  everything i'm not fearing any man my eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the law
[03:37:31.960 --> 03:37:36.400]  now the ending is important and can we can we play that last 15 seconds all the way through
[03:37:36.400 --> 03:37:42.400]  just one more time i want everyone to listen to the lion's war coming out of this lana
[03:37:42.400 --> 03:37:47.480]  preacher's mouth and i want you to watch how he slumps in his chair and i'm going to talk
[03:37:47.480 --> 03:37:54.480]  about the holy spirit and let's play that clip one more time the last 15 seconds or so
[03:37:54.480 --> 03:38:01.480]  so i'm happy tonight i'm not worried about anything i'm not fearing any man my eyes
[03:38:01.480 --> 03:38:09.480]  have seen the glory of the coming of the law
[03:38:09.480 --> 03:38:18.200]  can i get an amen cj i know you're a christian i'm a christian mlk in the speech what really
[03:38:18.200 --> 03:38:25.360]  impacts me as a believer is he slumps i mean here's a man who never tired and you could
[03:38:25.360 --> 03:38:31.320]  just see it wasn't defeat but it was pure exhaustion he left everything on the field
[03:38:31.320 --> 03:38:37.640]  and i remember feeling like that in 2016 when hillary clinton did like four stops and donald
[03:38:37.640 --> 03:38:43.680]  trump did like 40 you could just see i'm leaving it all on the field and he says you know this
[03:38:43.680 --> 03:38:48.880]  election is about whether we will be ruled by a small handful of people or whether we
[03:38:48.880 --> 03:38:52.960]  are still ruled by the people and there's a lot of black people who think that you and
[03:38:52.960 --> 03:38:58.960]  i right now are recommending heresy recommending heresy how dare you know only compare donald
[03:38:58.960 --> 03:39:05.880]  j trump to mlk but i see parallels in them both and they both were targeted by the fb
[03:39:05.880 --> 03:39:10.600]  i do you think that donald j trump needs to clean up our government and the rogue elements
[03:39:10.600 --> 03:39:15.240]  in the fb i do you think he needs to do what mlk jr couldn't do because they killed him
[03:39:15.240 --> 03:39:20.840]  uh do you think that he needs to go in here and clean house you know undoubtedly and i
[03:39:20.840 --> 03:39:25.120]  think he needs to do it very very soon because what we've seen is that the entire rush investigation
[03:39:25.120 --> 03:39:30.480]  was a we we we saw the conclusion that was brought forth by attorney general uh william
[03:39:30.480 --> 03:39:35.840]  bar there was no collusion found and now what we saw yesterday they are now trying to get
[03:39:35.840 --> 03:39:42.160]  his tax return they're grasping at everything they can to attempt to discredit those presents
[03:39:42.160 --> 03:39:45.240]  and you know what's interesting to me and what really uh you know is interesting but
[03:39:45.240 --> 03:39:49.440]  is also really really frustrating is that you have to ask yourself ultimately is that
[03:39:49.440 --> 03:39:53.840]  do they want this president to fail and they want the president to fail are they really
[03:39:53.840 --> 03:39:57.760]  the patriots they portrayed themselves to be because it's like they say that they're
[03:39:57.760 --> 03:40:02.480]  doing this in the name of patriots and they're doing this in the name of fairness and justice
[03:40:02.480 --> 03:40:07.680]  in america but this seems like a vendetta like they're not searching like there is a
[03:40:07.680 --> 03:40:13.040]  crime that they're investigating they're looking for a crime they're in search of wrongdoing
[03:40:13.040 --> 03:40:17.360]  and i don't think that that is how our legal process should be you know you just talked
[03:40:17.360 --> 03:40:22.800]  about the uh the biblical implications of what he was talking about about how marlton
[03:40:22.800 --> 03:40:26.560]  king in that speech left it all out on the field because he knew that his day was coming
[03:40:26.560 --> 03:40:31.200]  you know the bible study on tuesday and i and we they were talking about the story of erin
[03:40:31.200 --> 03:40:35.440]  and her and they were going again and they were in a battle and it was a battle that
[03:40:35.440 --> 03:40:40.560]  they were completely completely underwhelmed they they didn't have the ability to wage the
[03:40:40.560 --> 03:40:46.960]  war and which they're to do it appropriately but they leaned on god and and and it says
[03:40:46.960 --> 03:40:53.920]  that when they got tired mose has held up their arm and he said to go forth and persevere
[03:40:53.920 --> 03:40:59.120]  and guys why it is so important for people like you for i and everyone listening today
[03:40:59.120 --> 03:41:04.240]  for us to hold up the arms of president trump and let him know that we are in his corner
[03:41:04.240 --> 03:41:09.680]  and we have his back that we will fight for him until the end is near because this is
[03:41:09.680 --> 03:41:14.160]  what we are fighting is the same thing that marlton king was fighting we are challenging
[03:41:14.160 --> 03:41:20.160]  the existing world order in this country we are seeking to unify this nation to shake it up
[03:41:20.160 --> 03:41:26.640]  for the betterment of our country our nation and the everyday american this isn't a battle
[03:41:26.640 --> 03:41:31.760]  that's being waged in favor of the elites it's a battle being waged in favor of folks like you
[03:41:31.760 --> 03:41:36.960]  and i you know folks who work nine to fives or raise my folks who work time to five you know like
[03:41:36.960 --> 03:41:41.120]  this is what this is about this is the people's revolution and i'm not talking about bernie
[03:41:41.120 --> 03:41:48.560]  sanders people's revolution people's revolution as in like the people have the power now more
[03:41:48.560 --> 03:41:54.080]  than ever before and that is why the establishment is reacting the way that they are time and again
[03:41:54.080 --> 03:42:01.520]  the president trump cj you've got 30 seconds you have an initiative that's going to be launching
[03:42:01.520 --> 03:42:06.800]  here in a couple of weeks to help definitely get more people like us registered to vote can you
[03:42:06.800 --> 03:42:11.360]  talk about that in 30 seconds or do you want to save that for after the break for sure let's do

[03:43:57.840 --> 03:44:03.840]  but if you took it with fish oil it's like the fish oil hill is it the fish oil is better than
[03:44:03.840 --> 03:44:10.000]  it and that's an example of what i'm talking about fish oil is liquid energy brain body heart
[03:44:10.000 --> 03:44:14.240]  the cleanest the best out there you've got the children's you've got the adults you've got the
[03:44:14.240 --> 03:44:18.320]  krill oil if you're gonna get the full effect the fish oil and the children's are really strong
[03:44:18.320 --> 03:44:22.400]  they don't give you the burpees but krill oils is the best and it'll give you the damn burps and

[03:44:31.200 --> 03:44:39.120]  caplets of krill oil before i go to bed i'm seeing Santa Claus that night so your brain is made
[03:44:39.120 --> 03:44:46.800]  basically out of what fish oil is so we don't make a big profit off of it but you notice i just
[03:44:46.800 --> 03:44:51.040]  obsessed because whatever the best is we've got i just can't lie to you i just can't do it

[03:47:53.600 --> 03:48:00.080]  was taken away from us 51 years ago to judge people by the content of their character and i would say
[03:48:00.080 --> 03:48:07.120]  the content and the record of donald tray uh donald j trump's uh uh well his record as president
[03:48:07.120 --> 03:48:13.040]  don't want to talk about his time in new york but his record in dc is sterling and also if you're
[03:48:13.040 --> 03:48:18.640]  watching live here's my doggie ace let's take some callers and we're gonna run through these really
[03:48:18.640 --> 03:48:23.840]  quickly because y'all have been so loyal you guys have been so loyal you shop at the store
[03:48:23.840 --> 03:48:30.480]  you're willing to wait on hold for 40 minutes so i want to get to as many people as i can
[03:48:30.480 --> 03:48:36.240]  let's start with chris chris you don't have to ask me how i'm doing what do you want to tell
[03:48:36.240 --> 03:48:42.160]  the listeners around the world yeah what i want to tell the listeners around the world is and
[03:48:42.160 --> 03:48:46.800]  thanks for taking my call is that you know martin luther king you know he was a christian
[03:48:46.800 --> 03:48:51.120]  i'm glad that you know in a funny way we're having church right now but the thing is we've
[03:48:51.120 --> 03:48:58.800]  let these evil uh the the evil left did this this child sacrifice culture dominate and and
[03:48:58.800 --> 03:49:04.240]  take control of our society because the church man of god we have to rise up we have to begin to
[03:49:04.880 --> 03:49:09.200]  get back into prayer we need to get back get back to rallying and that's what i'm doing here in my
[03:49:09.200 --> 03:49:14.240]  state trying to rally the pastors together because we have the voice we have the power we
[03:49:14.240 --> 03:49:18.640]  we normally you know we want to take care of our families we want to just kind of live our lives
[03:49:18.640 --> 03:49:23.200]  but we can't we can't do that and and then we need to take our position i wrote a book called
[03:49:23.200 --> 03:49:28.560]  the church of thrones saying that church the church people need to take back their position
[03:49:28.560 --> 03:49:34.560]  because just like in the game of thrones if you don't evil people will yeah you're absolutely
[03:49:34.560 --> 03:49:39.440]  right thank you chris and you know what i like about chris what chris just said about take the
[03:49:39.440 --> 03:49:46.080]  throne is when i'm talking to my listeners i always tell people crowns up reclaim your crowns
[03:49:46.080 --> 03:49:52.720]  we are the heir to the throne let's go to preston in colorado preston what are you what do you want
[03:49:52.720 --> 03:50:01.360]  to tell us hey allie thanks um you know just like what mlk jr was saying you know he's seen the
[03:50:01.360 --> 03:50:07.600]  mountaintop he's seen the glory of god but you know right now we're being we're being shown
[03:50:07.600 --> 03:50:13.920]  biblical proportion of prophecy being fulfilled yeah just choosing against democrats and republicans
[03:50:13.920 --> 03:50:22.400]  and we're choosing against the forces of good and evil satan versus god and you know it's
[03:50:23.360 --> 03:50:27.120]  when when you hear the holy spirit speaking to you from someone else
[03:50:27.120 --> 03:50:34.160]  you know that feeling you get oh yeah man brother that feeling hits me so many times
[03:50:34.160 --> 03:50:39.520]  when i was listening to mlk jr speak man you can tell the holy spirit of god is with that man
[03:50:39.520 --> 03:50:45.680]  man yeah and i just i just want to encourage all the brothers and sisters out there in christ
[03:50:45.680 --> 03:50:51.200]  that you know the the closer we stick to god it's not going to be easy he says that it's not
[03:50:51.200 --> 03:50:57.520]  going to be easy no it's not thank you we'll have fellowship yeah thank you preston you're
[03:50:57.520 --> 03:51:03.360]  absolutely right we need to gather i mean that's why i'm guest hosting info wars you know for years
[03:51:03.360 --> 03:51:09.200]  and years i was a gop operative this was you know don't go on info wars don't talk to info wars
[03:51:09.200 --> 03:51:14.640]  in fact bad mouth them but what i've realized these past two years is that we cannot afford
[03:51:14.640 --> 03:51:19.440]  to discriminate we need to fight for the freedom of association the freedom of thought the freedom
[03:51:19.440 --> 03:51:24.640]  of speech and we need to put aside these petty differences and we need to fight this system
[03:51:24.640 --> 03:51:31.600]  you know jesus called it the world kanya calls it the simulation i call it the system and we
[03:51:31.600 --> 03:51:39.840]  got to beat it let's go to jeff jeff in canada hey allie uh nice talking to you yeah in the
[03:51:39.840 --> 03:51:44.800]  book in the book of revelation it says that the testimony of jesus is a spirit of prophecy and
[03:51:44.800 --> 03:51:49.840]  i'm just really thankful for you for alex you did a wonderful alex did a wonderful breakdown
[03:51:49.840 --> 03:51:56.960]  this morning at nine o'clock on on the big picture of everything and and you know as much as people
[03:51:56.960 --> 03:52:03.280]  want to take down info wars because of you know sandy hook or these different things with the
[03:52:03.280 --> 03:52:10.000]  first amendment it is the lifting up of jesus is why the establishment the globalists want info
[03:52:10.000 --> 03:52:16.560]  wars off the air there's an unashamed allegiance to jesus so not everybody's in different places
[03:52:16.560 --> 03:52:22.960]  some people are on the road but if you're if you're not against jesus you're for him and i just
[03:52:22.960 --> 03:52:28.800]  really thank you for being a modern-day prophet lifting up the name of jesus yeah amen i think
[03:52:28.800 --> 03:52:34.000]  it's i think it's i think what you're saying is absolutely right thanks for calling jeff is look
[03:52:34.000 --> 03:52:40.640]  our allegiance isn't to the almighty dollar our allegiance incident to a title with the un or the
[03:52:40.640 --> 03:52:47.280]  imf or whatever our allegiance is that well we got to go somewhere when we die and we got to be
[03:52:47.280 --> 03:52:55.760]  accountable for things the bible says you know that hate hate is murder in the heart and you
[03:52:55.760 --> 03:53:02.720]  know when you realize that you have an obligation look i still cuss i'm still sliding into dm's

[03:53:09.600 --> 03:53:17.920]  we know his record in new york we all have our flaws but those of us who choose to bear across choose
[03:53:17.920 --> 03:53:24.160]  to do so that we might live in a secular and open society where we can all get along the jew

[03:54:48.640 --> 03:54:55.040]  actually just true story true story i actually shocked at the info wars store a couple months

[03:55:07.200 --> 03:55:14.480]  kinds of animal poop and dust and all all kinds of crap literal and you know i found that it works
[03:55:14.480 --> 03:55:19.680]  for me and i don't think that people need to be ashamed of it i i watch people try to bully alex
[03:55:19.680 --> 03:55:24.880]  jones and info wars for selling products and i'm like well what's the alternative what's the
[03:55:24.880 --> 03:55:30.240]  alternative is he's supposed to take a tithing is alex jones supposed to be subsidized by the
[03:55:30.240 --> 03:55:37.360]  carlos sims or the jeff bezos of the world right push their agenda no no i i'm totally fine with
[03:55:37.360 --> 03:55:41.680]  the product thing and i think that people ought to dabble and people ought to take you know their
[03:55:41.680 --> 03:55:48.080]  spiritual health their mental well their mental health their emotional health all that stuff very
[03:55:48.080 --> 03:55:53.200]  very seriously an experiment with some of the stuff our last caller is adam at a canada adam i can
[03:55:53.200 --> 03:55:59.120]  give you 30 seconds you wanted to talk about the spiritual tower of babel can you condense that in
[03:55:59.120 --> 03:56:05.200]  30 seconds well it might be a radical interpretation i don't want to offend anybody because i was
[03:56:05.200 --> 03:56:10.480]  raised without god the idea of a higher power than not god but i just want to see a different
[03:56:10.480 --> 03:56:17.760]  interpretation of you know the tower of trying to reach a kind of an ideal and everybody loses
[03:56:17.760 --> 03:56:22.960]  their language they don't have a common language well it's not everybody having a different language
[03:56:22.960 --> 03:56:29.600]  everybody having no language at all we have no language you know and we've lost our our path to
[03:56:29.600 --> 03:56:35.920]  god that's a great point adam adam thanks for calling even though you're from canada you guys
[03:56:35.920 --> 03:56:42.000]  can be second best at least maybe but here's the thing and that's a really i we're wrapping up the
[03:56:42.000 --> 03:56:47.280]  show i've actually talked about that here on info wars that they mean the post-modernist and the
[03:56:47.280 --> 03:56:54.160]  marxist are not the same but they both have an agenda a war on words on linguistics that we may
[03:56:54.160 --> 03:57:02.320]  have no unifying cause to debate so not only are we not allowed to debate on on twitter or facebook
[03:57:02.320 --> 03:57:07.520]  but we're not allowed to have a common language by which we could debate even if we had the platform
[03:57:08.080 --> 03:57:11.840]  thank you guys so much for listening to the alex jones show we're going to hop over to another
