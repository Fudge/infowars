[02:41.040 --> 02:45.760]  who's been investigating Sandy Hook and being threatened and harassed and
[02:45.760 --> 02:51.400]  clearly Sandy Hook is staged we don't know exactly what happened I want to be
[02:51.400 --> 02:55.320]  clear it's kind of like if the cops know your line about something and they know
[02:55.320 --> 02:58.600]  your story doesn't fit and they know you're involved somehow and they know
[02:58.600 --> 03:02.480]  your official story isn't true they still don't know what exactly went on you
[03:02.480 --> 03:08.160]  understand but we're gonna be talking to school shooting expert threatened over
[03:08.160 --> 03:12.960]  Sandy Hook investigation was told to back off if bad things are going to

[03:39.760 --> 03:44.600]  blue screen with his nose disappearing and you can see a loop of footage shot
[03:44.600 --> 03:50.520]  there at the square in Connecticut there in Sandy Hook and you see bags
[03:50.520 --> 03:56.560]  blowing and then the bag blows the same way again I mean it's a loop folks so

[04:10.840 --> 04:14.800]  arrested minutes after the whole thing started when local police showed up and
[04:14.800 --> 04:17.440]  then they said oh we never stopped anybody it's made up you know their
[04:17.440 --> 04:20.480]  helicopter footage they later had to admit it so there's a cover up there all
[04:20.480 --> 04:26.320]  the signs are there all the signs are there that it was a drill and we don't
[04:26.320 --> 04:29.200]  know what else happened there but it but it was all staged to get our guns we

[08:41.400 --> 08:50.280]  Wednesday the 26th day of February 2014 the embattled Austin police chief Arde
[08:50.280 --> 08:54.680]  Savetta is scheduled to be in studio he's made international headlines in the
[08:54.680 --> 08:59.720]  last week with statements after the police tackled and arrested a woman
[08:59.720 --> 09:04.040]  who was jogging wearing earbuds listening to music and did not hear their
[09:04.040 --> 09:09.560]  command to stop and he said hey she's lucky she didn't get raped like other
[09:09.560 --> 09:15.200]  police departments would do and then he gave examples of police raping women and
[09:15.200 --> 09:22.280]  I guess it really is a real argument as sneaky and slick as Arde Savetta is he
[09:22.280 --> 09:26.400]  does have the will to come in on air and argue with me in debate and he does say
[09:26.400 --> 09:30.600]  off the cuff things that I actually agree with I mean it shows how much
[09:30.600 --> 09:33.360]  trouble this country is in that we ought to be glad they're just not raping
[09:33.360 --> 09:36.960]  people like some other big police departments are but that's not why I've
[09:36.960 --> 09:42.120]  got him coming on but we'll raise that issue with him at the bottom of the
[09:42.120 --> 09:48.720]  third hour by the way one of my friends went out to eat in downtown last week
[09:48.720 --> 09:53.000]  and about 10 o'clock at night was leaving after the business meeting and he
[09:53.000 --> 09:56.800]  got pulled over with him and his buddy and both of them are not one of them
[09:56.800 --> 10:00.080]  hardly drinks the other person hasn't had anything to drink in 17 years he's
[10:00.080 --> 10:04.520]  proud of that and the cop screams at him get out of the car he's like well what
[10:04.520 --> 10:06.920]  have I done we'll just get out of the car and you're gonna you're gonna you're
[10:06.920 --> 10:11.680]  gonna breathe in this breathalyzer using you know force using threat okay I'll
[10:11.680 --> 10:16.560]  breathe in the breathalyzer and then no alcohol found so the other guy says I
[10:16.560 --> 10:19.040]  haven't had anything to drink in 17 years he screams at him and says I don't
[10:19.040 --> 10:24.560]  believe you shut up liar and that all goes on and he said the cop looked like
[10:24.560 --> 10:32.080]  he was about 19 years old and was just screaming at him the whole time and I
[10:32.080 --> 10:36.880]  just don't know if I can handle this anymore in a so-called free country
[10:36.880 --> 10:40.240]  being treated like that now most awesome police do not act like that and I know
[10:40.240 --> 10:44.560]  we're a nationwide radio show it's just that more and more it's like we're in
[10:44.560 --> 10:49.080]  Fallujah and I'm an al-Qaeda operative is the way I'm being treated or something
[10:49.080 --> 10:53.480]  like I'm a terrorist and I've just quite frankly had enough of it but that's
[10:53.480 --> 10:58.960]  coming up we're gonna have open phones obviously today and cover a ton of news
[10:58.960 --> 11:06.640]  Rand Paul is the GOP's early presidential frontrunner all the
[11:06.640 --> 11:10.680]  establishment hopes for a governor to emerge he is quietly putting together a
[11:10.680 --> 11:16.520]  formidable operation Rand Paul and then of course Ted Cruz are libertarian
[11:16.520 --> 11:20.320]  conservatives and are the guys that helped beat the gun grab in the Senate
[11:20.320 --> 11:24.480]  people could say oh they're not perfect on this or that they're light years
[11:24.480 --> 11:28.480]  better than Hillary Clinton they're light years better than Chuck E. Schumer
[11:28.480 --> 11:33.360]  they're light years better than Harry Reid and Barack Obama and they have
[11:33.360 --> 11:37.680]  ideas that will help get this country back on track and it shows how awake
[11:37.680 --> 11:43.680]  this country is that just three years ago Rand Paul was seen as a radical and
[11:43.680 --> 11:47.160]  as a long shot and the Republican establishment lined up to try to beat
[11:47.160 --> 11:51.240]  him in the primaries in Kentucky the Democrats lined up against him big
[11:51.240 --> 11:56.440]  business lined up against him but it it failed and it's an example of how
[11:56.440 --> 12:01.440]  libertarian constitutionalist can take over the Republican Party now just two
[12:01.440 --> 12:07.520]  months ago Ted Cruz was the frontrunner in polls and with money to be able to
[12:07.520 --> 12:13.520]  run for president but Rand Paul started getting more hardcore and saying why is
[12:13.520 --> 12:19.840]  Bill Clinton raising money when he's a known serial rapist sexual predator why
[12:19.840 --> 12:26.800]  is the system and feminist not going after this guy and Rand Paul is back in
[12:26.800 --> 12:35.200]  the news today in CBS news Rand Paul Democrats should be embarrassed to be
[12:35.200 --> 12:41.400]  seen with Bill Clinton exactly he's he's he's calling out the shame of these
[12:41.400 --> 12:46.880]  people and that's how you win is calling the other side out on Benghazi on
[12:46.880 --> 12:52.200]  fashion furious on salandra on shutting down our power plants on Obama acting
[12:52.200 --> 12:56.760]  like a dictator on Obamacare but you don't see any of the Republican blue
[12:56.760 --> 13:05.440]  bloods doing any of this do you zero all you see them doing is running around like
[13:05.440 --> 13:10.440]  Tasmanian devils with their heads cut off chickens with their heads cut off
[13:10.440 --> 13:14.920]  trying to beat the Tea Party because the globalist have already conquered this
[13:14.920 --> 13:20.000]  nation they've already conquered us through fraud illegitimately and so now
[13:20.000 --> 13:22.920]  they've just got to have the illusion of choice between Republican and Democrat
[13:22.920 --> 13:27.000]  but if the Tea Party comes in and takes over well then there's actually a
[13:27.000 --> 13:32.040]  second party in this country and there's a choice and people will realize
[13:32.040 --> 13:35.920]  there's hope and they will get behind good candidates and then the process can
[13:35.920 --> 13:40.200]  be reversed we can start going back on the on the path of prosperity because I
[13:40.200 --> 13:45.880]  don't care how much power the globalist have once they've been identified once
[13:45.880 --> 13:50.200]  they've been exposed as scamsters and fraudsters and basically kleptocrats it's
[13:50.200 --> 13:58.000]  came over and we have the tools right now ladies and gentlemen to absolutely
[13:58.000 --> 14:09.160]  bring this corrupt oligarchy down but we have to get aggressive if we've got
[14:09.160 --> 14:14.440]  any hope of ever doing that okay let's get into some of the news here I just
[14:14.440 --> 14:25.320]  mentioned this IRS warns Obamacare tax must be paid with tax return agency
[14:25.320 --> 14:30.360]  employs or well in term shared responsibility payment to describe
[14:30.360 --> 14:37.200]  Obamacare individual tax mandate and they go on on the IRS website to say
[14:37.200 --> 14:42.400]  that you will be made to pay it and to report on yourself in your tax return
[14:42.400 --> 14:47.000]  and that they're going to come for your money the term shared tax
[14:47.000 --> 14:51.440]  responsibility payment refers to Obamacare individual mandate tax one of
[14:51.440 --> 14:57.600]  at least seven tax hikes in the Obamacare law that directly hit families
[14:57.600 --> 15:04.920]  making less than two hundred and fifty thousand dollars per year and of course
[15:04.920 --> 15:09.120]  they're talking about garnishing wages not sending tax refunds and grabbing
[15:09.120 --> 15:15.000]  money out of bank accounts the IRS goes on to say if you've not paid the five
[15:15.000 --> 15:19.440]  thousand dollar fine or gotten to the so-called health care you may owe a
[15:19.440 --> 15:24.360]  shared responsibility payment when you file in 2015 did you hear that they're
[15:24.360 --> 15:28.400]  going to call it the shared responsibility payment and the IRS is
[15:28.400 --> 15:32.480]  going to collect it's like when they hired 17,000 new IRS agents in the bill
[15:32.480 --> 15:37.760]  they went no we're not gonna tax you the IRS isn't gonna take that money I mean
[15:37.760 --> 15:42.560]  it's in the bill and it's a law but we're not going to now let the bill
[15:42.560 --> 15:50.560]  pass yeah shut up racist everybody knows they're not gonna tax this liar well
[15:50.560 --> 16:00.960]  it's in the bill you need to shut up teabagger and now we see it all unfolding
[16:00.960 --> 16:05.440]  from the IRS is on website and meanwhile Obama is running around going oh
[16:05.440 --> 16:09.320]  I'm gonna wave it for a year I'm gonna only for big corporations not for
[16:09.320 --> 16:14.120]  individuals I mean it is a giant screw job ladies and gentlemen and they're
[16:14.120 --> 16:17.200]  getting away with it so why not next they're gonna take your bank accounts
[16:17.200 --> 16:22.280]  your 401ks your IRAs and take a large percentage of it nationalizing it that's
[16:22.280 --> 16:26.640]  all being announced already being done in Europe bail ins they're gonna take
[16:26.640 --> 16:30.600]  large slices of your bank account money and threaten that the stock market's
[16:30.600 --> 16:34.280]  gonna tank if you don't that's how they hold you hostage it's the same program
[16:34.280 --> 16:40.160]  over and over and over again and they're placing more and more capital
[16:40.160 --> 16:46.040]  controls on cash and other systems here's a Washington Post article Obama
[16:46.040 --> 16:51.560]  administration health law health laws new rules will increase costs for most
[16:51.560 --> 16:56.400]  small businesses yes it'll make people cut hours and lay folks off but hey can
[16:56.400 --> 17:03.000]  always go on welfare and Breitbart reports perpetual amnesty
[17:03.000 --> 17:08.640]  minors illegally crossing Texas border on the rise because their parents can
[17:08.640 --> 17:15.120]  then be brought in under the new amnesty law that Obama's implementing by Fiat so
[17:15.120 --> 17:22.000]  that's just some of the news on that front continuing here today gold rises
[17:22.000 --> 17:29.960]  to 17 week high on signs of US economy sputters well it's on the weakening
[17:29.960 --> 17:33.440]  dollar that's why they artificially keep gold down that even came out in the
[17:33.440 --> 17:36.840]  financial times of London two days ago in a big report that they then pulled

[24:21.480 --> 24:27.040]  Financial Times deep-sixing that story I want to get into that thanks again we're
[24:27.040 --> 24:29.440]  back live ladies and gentlemen thank you so much for joining us on this
[24:29.440 --> 24:33.880]  Wednesday edition imagine Connecticut where they tell you you got to go
[24:33.880 --> 24:38.880]  register all your semi-autos and your magazines and clips and then the
[24:38.880 --> 24:42.400]  government offices weren't open long enough people are unable to do it a lot
[24:42.400 --> 24:45.560]  of folks just didn't do it because it's unconstitutional and now the state
[24:45.560 --> 24:48.040]  police are sending them letters saying we're getting ready to come arrest you
[24:48.040 --> 24:52.200]  you're not allowed to register it now you just got to turn them all in
[24:52.200 --> 24:58.360]  law abiding citizens this is an illegitimate government more and more
[24:58.360 --> 25:02.520]  and we're not saying the average person that works for the system is a bad
[25:02.520 --> 25:06.560]  person we don't want to be your enemy but you've got to stop following these
[25:06.560 --> 25:10.960]  unconstitutional orders the American people got to stop following it you've
[25:10.960 --> 25:14.560]  got election fraud you've got all sorts of criminality going on you've got
[25:14.560 --> 25:18.760]  illegals allowed to vote all over the country and being given driver's
[25:18.760 --> 25:24.400]  license while citizens are harassed I mean it's unprecedented how you're
[25:24.400 --> 25:29.120]  penalized if you try to work in the system and do what you're told in this
[25:29.120 --> 25:34.160]  country and it's getting worse and worse by the day now speaking of things being
[25:34.160 --> 25:37.080]  rigged it came out with LIBOR internationally they're rigging interest
[25:37.080 --> 25:42.960]  rates a few years ago even Rolling Stone had a cover story about everything
[25:42.960 --> 25:48.120]  is rigged was the headline all the major IRA is all the major stocks all the
[25:48.120 --> 25:54.440]  major derivative funds it's rigged folks for insiders to be able to take over
[25:54.440 --> 25:57.760]  there's the headline everything is rigged the biggest price fixing scandal
[25:57.760 --> 26:04.080]  ever and that means that select insiders get to take over all the markets not
[26:04.080 --> 26:08.040]  because of productivity not because of quality not because of competition but
[26:08.040 --> 26:12.920]  because their combine is in control this is what the right wing won't explain
[26:12.920 --> 26:17.000]  to you they say all corporations are perfect and are good the left says all
[26:17.000 --> 26:21.840]  corporations are bad only government is good when it's a fascist model a
[26:21.840 --> 26:27.640]  corporatist model on top a fascist model on top with socialism on the bottom as
[26:27.640 --> 26:33.520]  a tool of domestication and control this is the type of issue we're talking
[26:33.520 --> 26:41.600]  about here and it's not my opinion that we've had world currency devaluations
[26:41.600 --> 26:45.480]  especially in the dollar in the last 30 years I mean when I started promoting
[26:45.480 --> 26:54.000]  gold in 1996 it was $300 an ounce or less it peaked almost at 2,000 I didn't
[26:54.000 --> 26:57.960]  sell one piece of gold or silver I bought silver went up to 50 went back down
[26:57.960 --> 27:05.680]  to 20 I didn't sell a single piece of it because I fundamentally know that the
[27:05.680 --> 27:10.240]  they're devaluing paper across the board all sorts of financial instruments in a
[27:10.240 --> 27:15.000]  bubble and in the final equation gold and silver and platinum and palladium and
[27:15.000 --> 27:22.360]  copper and so many other commodities traded on the open mercantile exchange
[27:22.360 --> 27:27.160]  are going to go up and the elites universities governments they're all
[27:27.160 --> 27:33.560]  hoarding it as well they're net sellers of paper gold to short the market naked
[27:33.560 --> 27:40.920]  shorted but they're overall hoarders and massive owners of the metals physically
[27:40.920 --> 27:47.280]  now let's get into Bloomberg gold rises to 17 week high on signs US economy

[37:00.280 --> 37:04.600]  contest because the NSA and TSA have been threatening people the rest suing
[37:04.600 --> 37:10.480]  people and threatening suits that are critical of them and so we funded back
[37:10.480 --> 37:17.720]  in December a $10,000 one place one one winner first-place winner prize and
[37:17.720 --> 37:22.880]  hundreds of great videos got produced everyone is a winner that entered the
[37:22.880 --> 37:26.320]  contest and some of the videos got half a million views some of the biggest
[37:26.320 --> 37:29.160]  ones a lot of the others got hundreds of thousands of views so millions of
[37:29.160 --> 37:34.560]  people ended up seeing this and you've done a great job the winner is Dick
[37:34.560 --> 37:41.200]  Johnson TSA wonder kind by David Kirk West writer-director
[37:41.200 --> 37:46.600]  cinematographer and it deals with the pre-screening that's really in SA
[37:46.600 --> 37:50.920]  pre-screening where they track everything you do and use the TSA as the
[37:50.920 --> 37:55.560]  front to data mine all your information that's now causing a lot of
[37:55.560 --> 38:01.200]  controversy obviously because it's totally unconstitutional we're going to
[38:01.200 --> 38:05.640]  be airing part of this a little bit later on the show though it's more
[38:05.640 --> 38:12.800]  obviously in constructive and induced to see how good it is watching it the video
[38:12.800 --> 38:22.920]  is up on info wars dot com right now again we probably want to check my
[38:22.920 --> 38:26.720]  computer in here because even an hour after an article goes up it won't show
[38:26.720 --> 38:31.200]  me new stories on this computer it's very strange because that because I know
[38:31.200 --> 38:35.040]  we put it up before the show even started and you could as you can see on
[38:35.040 --> 38:40.120]  my computer it is not the top story but on your computer out there it is the
[38:40.120 --> 38:46.280]  top story up on info wars dot com and prison planet dot com we're gonna send
[38:46.280 --> 38:51.240]  it out on Twitter and on Facebook and it's a good way to fight back against
[38:51.240 --> 38:55.840]  their tyranny to send this on to the rest of folks on your Facebook to send
[38:55.840 --> 39:00.120]  this on to the rest of the folks on your Twitter but coming up the next break I
[39:00.120 --> 39:10.520]  will tweet it and I will Facebook it out there for everybody now continuing
[39:10.520 --> 39:17.720]  here with the news I want to get your take on Obamacare from Obamacare
[39:17.720 --> 39:21.400]  supporters you know that they promise you could keep your doctor you could have
[39:21.400 --> 39:24.160]  previous conditions you wouldn't be kicked off your insurance it would cut
[39:24.160 --> 39:28.800]  the cost down the cost of a phone bill or cable bill of course it's done the
[39:28.800 --> 39:33.520]  opposite and now the IRS is announcing they will be taking it out of your bank
[39:33.520 --> 39:38.640]  account now your wages on the IRS website headline IRS warns Obamacare tax
[39:38.640 --> 39:45.800]  must be paid with tax return and the or they will they will take it and give you
[39:45.800 --> 39:49.640]  penalties and interest with the collection agency for the private
[39:49.640 --> 39:53.240]  federal reserve and the Supreme Court has ruled this is a tax to the offshore
[39:53.240 --> 39:57.240]  banks openly so I think that's really one of the biggest stories out there
[39:57.240 --> 40:02.520]  today and the bigger story is why is it being repealed only Rand Paul and
[40:02.520 --> 40:09.480]  Stockman of Texas and Cruz of Texas and Walter Jones of North Carolina and a
[40:09.480 --> 40:13.280]  few others are actually calling for us repeal John Boehner and others are
[40:13.280 --> 40:22.120]  doing nothing and the argument with some blue bloods is some of the so-called
[40:22.120 --> 40:27.160]  country club Republicans the idiots or those that get money off government
[40:27.160 --> 40:33.080]  contracts oh Obamacare will hurt Obama so we need to let it go through that's
[40:33.080 --> 40:37.480]  completely a moral a be the Republican leadership help write it it's for foreign
[40:37.480 --> 40:42.040]  insurance companies and offshore banks it's criminal and so you will all be
[40:42.040 --> 40:45.920]  held accountable as well for this monstrosity design destroy our health
[40:45.920 --> 40:49.600]  care system further bankrupt the country and make people basically become
[40:49.600 --> 40:52.760]  dependent on the system and go on welfare and get their hours cut from 40 to
[40:52.760 --> 40:57.040]  25 hours the list goes on and on I mean this is such an abomination and the Tea
[40:57.040 --> 41:01.520]  Party is going to use it to sweep to power if we get behind them and I mean
[41:01.520 --> 41:05.920]  the real libertarian Tea Party that Ron Paul started that I helped start when he
[41:05.920 --> 41:12.760]  first ran for office back in 2007 that's what we're talking about is the real
[41:12.760 --> 41:20.680]  Tea Party ladies and gentlemen of eight nine years ago not the one the
[41:20.680 --> 41:25.720]  Republicans tried to create to absorb things that failed and so now the whole
[41:25.720 --> 41:29.240]  system's coming after me I know I talk about that a lot but 2014 is the key
[41:29.240 --> 41:34.000]  election year balance of power you've got to get libertarians in as
[41:34.000 --> 41:37.920]  Republicans to block this whole thing and that's why the enemy says that's the
[41:37.920 --> 41:40.760]  main threat and is spending all their time trying to beat it they discussed
[41:40.760 --> 41:45.000]  that at Bilderberg meetings the last three years they are scared here's the
[41:45.000 --> 41:56.880]  toll-free number to join us 800 259 9231 800 259 9231 and we will get you up
[41:56.880 --> 42:04.800]  and on the air here today but I want to get your take on all of this by the way
[42:04.800 --> 42:11.040]  the Austin police chief is going to be in studio coming up for 30 minutes in the
[42:11.040 --> 42:15.640]  last hour today and I thought I'd play this clip where he said at least they're
[42:15.640 --> 42:21.840]  not sexually assaulting people from one of his press conferences here's the
[42:21.840 --> 42:26.960]  headline police chief forced to apologize over comments saying that at
[42:26.960 --> 42:31.840]  least a jogger didn't have to deal with police who sexually assaulted her like
[42:31.840 --> 42:36.160]  other police departments have recently been caught doing and the footage is
[42:36.160 --> 42:41.040]  out there the woman jogging with the earbuds in on her iPad or iPod she can't
[42:41.040 --> 42:48.480]  hear them so they tackle her slammer on the ground and take her to jail means
[42:48.480 --> 42:53.440]  that up to tackle somebody because you said they're quote jaywalking and but
[42:53.440 --> 42:56.760]  then why didn't you still give her a ticket why'd you take her to jail because
[42:56.760 --> 43:00.040]  it's all about the government's dominance and its authority and its power
[43:00.040 --> 43:05.480]  and teaching you not to stand up here is a excerpt of what the police chief said
[43:05.480 --> 43:09.680]  Ricky Melendez and Chris Quintero were sitting across the street Quintero
[43:09.680 --> 43:13.440]  doesn't think the officer did run up a cider like Acevedo said I think he
[43:13.440 --> 43:17.800]  grabbed her slightly from behind and it's it may not be from far behind but
[43:17.800 --> 43:21.480]  enough to where she didn't notice who was grabbing her right away whether or
[43:21.480 --> 43:26.560]  not he grabbed her by behind it doesn't mean it's not relevant at some point she
[43:26.560 --> 43:31.480]  knows it's a cop the cop asked her a lawful question that she is lawfully
[43:31.480 --> 43:35.400]  required to answer and she didn't that's why she went to jail
[43:35.400 --> 43:39.480]  Acevedo says the woman was only arrested for failure to identify not resisting
[43:39.480 --> 43:42.800]  arrest he says if he'd arrested her he wouldn't have been so generous and at
[43:42.800 --> 43:46.920]  the end of the day that officer has to stop him somehow he didn't tackle her
[43:46.920 --> 43:51.760]  to the ground you know it's kind of interesting what passes for controversy
[43:51.760 --> 43:56.920]  in Austin Texas thank you Lord that it's a controversy in Austin Texas that we
[43:56.920 --> 44:01.400]  actually had the audacity to touch somebody by the arm and tell them oh my
[44:01.400 --> 44:05.520]  good this Austin police are trying to get your attention in other cities cops
[44:05.520 --> 44:10.160]  are actually committing sexual assaults on duty so I thank God that this is what
[44:10.160 --> 44:15.560]  passes for a controversy in Austin Texas I mean I kind of agree with that
[44:15.560 --> 44:19.920]  statement that but that did that just because other departments are so bad on
[44:19.920 --> 44:23.400]  average big departments doesn't mean that it's okay and by the way they did
[44:23.400 --> 44:27.320]  grab her and twist her arm out her back and put her on the ground so more more
[44:27.320 --> 44:36.280]  baloney from our day Cerveta coming up in studio that's not the main reason I
[44:36.280 --> 44:38.920]  was getting him on we got a report we're gonna premiere later today we have
[44:38.920 --> 44:42.560]  time or it'll be on the nightly news tonight your car Jackson went out yesterday
[44:42.560 --> 44:46.880]  on the street asking folks we thought about it in the you know the point is
[44:46.880 --> 44:50.440]  police in the past wouldn't have acted like this and a lot of times they would
[44:50.440 --> 44:54.400]  shoot him or taser them you hear about autistic people deaf folks being attacked
[44:54.400 --> 45:01.320]  from behind people that don't speak English it's scary because a lot of cops
[45:01.320 --> 45:06.920]  out there really are PTSD loose cannons whatever the case is and they've been
[45:06.920 --> 45:10.560]  taught you're gonna be backed up whatever you do the main reason I wanted
[45:10.560 --> 45:17.120]  to him in studio and I heard him say this months ago on a 590 a.m. he said
[45:17.120 --> 45:21.680]  follow whatever order you're given even if you think it's unlawful and you
[45:21.680 --> 45:27.120]  won't get hurt well actually there's Supreme Court and state rulings that we
[45:27.120 --> 45:31.120]  have a right to defend ourselves with force from unlawful unconstitutional
[45:31.120 --> 45:35.880]  orders and directives of police in fact guys you print me some case examples of
[45:35.880 --> 45:38.920]  that I know there's hundreds of them about court rules you have a right to
[45:38.920 --> 45:45.760]  defend yourself from police outside of their duties or court rules like I'll
[45:45.760 --> 45:50.080]  search it because I have to come up with the exact term Indiana passed the law
[45:50.080 --> 45:53.640]  allowing deadly force against police try to enter your home without a warrant I
[45:53.640 --> 45:58.080]  mean these have always been on the book but they're having to pass new laws
[45:58.080 --> 46:06.040]  stating that you have a right that when they're outside of their lawful duties to
[46:06.040 --> 46:12.960]  resist we incorporate cities and we hire police officers to then be
[46:12.960 --> 46:18.680]  professional citizen arrest powers that's all they have and now they like a
[46:18.680 --> 46:22.600]  union want to get rid of our right to be armed our right to defend ourselves and
[46:22.600 --> 46:28.480]  our right to have due process I've got a bunch of other news on Ukraine also
[46:28.480 --> 46:32.600]  California college student teaches school fifty thousand dollar lesson on
[46:32.600 --> 46:39.080]  Constitution Fox News member he got cited and arrested for handing out pocket
[46:39.080 --> 46:46.520]  constitutions at the college and he's now won at fifty thousand dollars they
[46:46.520 --> 46:53.120]  violated his rights that just shows how warped the school is to say oh to have
[46:53.120 --> 46:56.320]  an official event you've got to be sanctioned by us well you're allowed to
[46:56.320 --> 46:58.600]  physically hand out whatever you want you're allowed to hand out Christmas
[46:58.600 --> 47:03.320]  cards and say I love Jesus on them the school can't be if it takes taxpayer
[47:03.320 --> 47:08.880]  money officially pushing a religious view and the same thing with a First
[47:08.880 --> 47:15.040]  Amendment view just for speech so there you go another example and people see
[47:15.040 --> 47:18.160]  this everywhere you know cops coming over and saying I've had Austin cops
[47:18.160 --> 47:21.920]  come over and say turn your camera off you can't film and I'm a hundred yards
[47:21.920 --> 47:25.720]  from what they're doing and I go nope First Amendment woman I rest you well I
[47:25.720 --> 47:29.040]  don't have to sue you officer but you know please don't violate my First
[47:29.040 --> 47:32.560]  Amendment they'll back off in other cities I've been arrested for filming
[47:32.560 --> 47:38.960]  and my cameraman have and Rob do want a big lawsuit with Pittsburgh and I mean
[47:38.960 --> 47:45.040]  he had to do it he was up on top of Hill filming police attack peaceful college
[47:45.040 --> 47:48.280]  students the day after G20 ended they came up to mainstream media said your
[47:48.280 --> 47:52.840]  mainstream media your major who are you with along with Texas television info
[47:52.840 --> 47:57.880]  or so we're gonna arrest you you're not allowed to be out here in America on a
[47:57.880 --> 48:04.960]  hill over a university aiming a camera down 300 yards that's America the cops
[48:04.960 --> 48:08.440]  actually believe that and treat you like you're in an occupied third-world
[48:08.440 --> 48:15.840]  country let's go to Thomas you're on the air go ahead sir hi Alex you there yes
[48:15.840 --> 48:19.720]  I am hey thanks for taking my call I had the pleasure of meeting you in San
[48:19.720 --> 48:23.860]  Antonio at the gun rally I was uh standing behind you while you're
[48:23.860 --> 48:27.640]  interviewing sergeant slaughter and one of his cronies put pushed me out of the
[48:27.640 --> 48:31.040]  way cuz I was getting too close to the king I guess I don't know oh and I
[48:31.040 --> 48:34.360]  interviewed the San Antonio police chief yeah we did an open carry
[48:34.360 --> 48:40.160]  demonstration and I had my M4 strapped to my back along about 1500 other Texans
[48:40.160 --> 48:44.760]  and you know the police didn't implement their law against open carry even
[48:44.760 --> 48:48.520]  though it's unconstitutional they backed off that day didn't they it was a
[48:48.520 --> 48:51.480]  good thing you know but once everybody started dwindling down you could see
[48:51.480 --> 48:54.520]  then they start to start and put in pressure on people to get out of there
[48:54.520 --> 48:58.760]  but that's right well we're enemies you know we're the food that'll be kept in
[48:58.760 --> 49:02.600]  line go ahead one of the reasons I called though to tell you I worked for an
[49:02.600 --> 49:08.640]  old company in 2010 over in Iraq and when I was there there were no banks there
[49:08.640 --> 49:13.000]  were no you know no debt there and we drilled the well and we made a
[49:13.000 --> 49:18.080]  tremendous amount of oil so the plan was to extract the natural resources I
[49:18.080 --> 49:21.520]  still keep in contact with the friends I made there locally and now they all have
[49:21.520 --> 49:26.760]  credit cards and banks all over northern Iraq well that's why the globalists
[49:26.760 --> 49:30.480]  come in and take down sovereign nations is they want to get you into their debt
[49:30.480 --> 49:34.560]  money system you're absolutely right there was a shadow the shadow investor
[49:34.560 --> 49:39.480]  that was called Chalmer on petroleum Chalmer on petroleum calm it's I mean
[49:39.480 --> 49:43.280]  just looks evil and the literal translation for it is king of serpents
[49:43.280 --> 49:47.600]  is what they call themselves so I mean I'm a religious person so just think it
[49:47.600 --> 49:51.120]  just seems bad to me all the way around I got out of that business because it
[49:51.120 --> 49:55.120]  just didn't feel right if you know what I mean I hear you what else do you want
[49:55.120 --> 50:00.560]  to talk about I was a I witnessed a wreck over in Pleasanton Texas I was I'm
[50:00.560 --> 50:03.880]  still in the whole field down here in South Texas I witnessed the wreck and I
[50:03.880 --> 50:08.040]  pulled over a truck it was there in that first ice storm in January a truck
[50:08.040 --> 50:12.400]  ran into the back of a little car and then took off he let that car crash I
[50:12.400 --> 50:17.000]  got out to wave traffic away from this car until police arrived and the guys
[50:17.000 --> 50:20.320]  were unconscious when I got there they woke up they were you know they really
[50:20.320 --> 50:24.400]  heard this truck smashed into him and then drove off and when the cops got
[50:24.400 --> 50:28.160]  there the first thing they asked me was were you in the wreck I said no I said
[50:28.160 --> 50:32.120]  if these gentlemen over here and he walks up to the gentleman and instead of

[01:01:12.040 --> 01:01:16.480]  Hiram I believe you pronounce it in Puerto Rico you're on the air thanks for
[01:01:16.480 --> 01:01:23.040]  calling hi Alex I've been listening to you for about maybe a month or two and
[01:01:23.040 --> 01:01:28.680]  boy I see a pattern I don't know if I'm being paranoid but I call from Puerto
[01:01:28.680 --> 01:01:34.880]  Rico and I see the government run healthcare and the militarized police
[01:01:34.880 --> 01:01:41.360]  we've been having that since the early 90s so when I first saw like the outrage
[01:01:41.360 --> 01:01:46.680]  about the militarized police I didn't really get it but I guess we've been
[01:01:46.680 --> 01:01:52.000]  conditioned to that for decades already and I don't know even the the agent
[01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:58.880]  orange back in the day they tried it here first on Santo they run tests I'm not
[01:01:58.880 --> 01:02:03.840]  very informed I've been awake only for like six months after Snowden
[01:02:03.840 --> 01:02:08.360]  revelations oh you're informed here I mean your look it's an illegal spying
[01:02:08.360 --> 01:02:13.880]  takeover it's a criminal government mobilizing paramilitarily against us
[01:02:13.880 --> 01:02:20.080]  and and they're getting armored vehicles you name it lining up setting up an
[01:02:20.080 --> 01:02:24.800]  epic police state and then again training that the number one enemy is gun
[01:02:24.800 --> 01:02:30.920]  owners and patriots go ahead I'm not a gun owner but I have to tell you here in
[01:02:30.920 --> 01:02:36.440]  put in Puerto Rico we have one of the strictest gun controls policies you can
[01:02:36.440 --> 01:02:42.800]  ever find I remember my dad back in the 80s he needed to wait for like a year or
[01:02:42.800 --> 01:02:49.000]  over a year to get a revolver a 38 caliber revolver so most law-abiding
[01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:55.360]  citizens they either you know have a gun or they don't but you know actually I
[01:02:55.360 --> 01:03:00.600]  lost I lost four friends of mine last year none of them was killed by a law
[01:03:00.600 --> 01:03:05.880]  abiding citizen gun owner so I don't think that's gonna work like sure I mean
[01:03:05.880 --> 01:03:11.160]  it is the system knows not letting the general public have guns turned you into
[01:03:11.160 --> 01:03:15.920]  Chicago or New York murder capitals or Mexico it's because it's a criminal
[01:03:15.920 --> 01:03:22.240]  instinct to disarm the slaves and that's what's happened
[01:03:23.800 --> 01:03:29.440]  and the other thing I had I noticed that yesterday you were talking about
[01:03:29.440 --> 01:03:36.080]  over feminized little girls and the estrogen mimicers and all that yes and I
[01:03:36.080 --> 01:03:41.160]  noticed like we usually take pride on that but like little girls here you see
[01:03:41.160 --> 01:03:46.040]  like eight nine year old girls with with breasts and like you know over the
[01:03:46.040 --> 01:03:51.360]  body and we always take pride on that but I'm I don't know maybe I'm being
[01:03:51.360 --> 01:03:57.560]  paranoid but are they using us as guinea pigs for their bigger more nefarious
[01:03:57.560 --> 01:04:01.760]  there is no doubt sir that it's it's accelerating the aging process and
[01:04:01.760 --> 01:04:06.800]  cutting decades off girls lives all the hormones but again they wanted to
[01:04:06.800 --> 01:04:11.440]  feminize men so it doubles down on the women that's what's happening I

[01:08:04.440 --> 01:08:12.200]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does
[01:08:12.200 --> 01:08:19.760]  he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas
[01:08:19.760 --> 01:08:23.240]  Alex Jones
[01:08:31.360 --> 01:08:35.360]  or your phone calls are coming up but right now let me get some more of the
[01:08:35.360 --> 01:08:42.600]  news that just went up on info wars dot com pollster top pollster in the US
[01:08:42.600 --> 01:08:50.680]  Kiev style revolt coming to America but the last thing we want there's video of
[01:08:50.680 --> 01:08:55.360]  it too is for the controlled kleptocratic left to hijack that and
[01:08:55.360 --> 01:09:00.000]  bringing a really hardcore tearing you see they can create the atmosphere for
[01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:04.680]  revolt and then hijack it former presidential advisor says soft
[01:09:04.680 --> 01:09:08.760]  corruption will lead to domestic disorder pollster and former presidential
[01:09:08.760 --> 01:09:15.080]  advisor pat caddell warns that the rise of soft oppression and corruption in
[01:09:15.080 --> 01:09:18.040]  the United States will facilitate a violent Kiev style uprising the
[01:09:18.040 --> 01:09:21.520]  streets of America he's the same guy that said last week correctly that
[01:09:21.520 --> 01:09:25.840]  republican leadership is going after the tea party and that's why they won't
[01:09:25.840 --> 01:09:33.360]  investigate the IRS persecution because they they they wanted to continue what
[01:09:33.360 --> 01:09:39.880]  we're seeing in the world in Kiev is American values at work these people in
[01:09:39.880 --> 01:09:43.880]  the rest of the world are saying we're not putting up with this and we'll put
[01:09:43.880 --> 01:09:48.800]  our lives on it and I agree that the Ukrainian government was corrupt but
[01:09:48.800 --> 01:09:52.920]  the last Western back government was corrupt too and George Soros and the
[01:09:52.920 --> 01:09:56.800]  West are in there with the State Department stirring it up it'll end up
[01:09:56.800 --> 01:10:00.560]  being worse I mean that's what I'm saying and it starts a confrontation with
[01:10:00.560 --> 01:10:06.080]  Russia we shouldn't be involved my point in this country a populist equally
[01:10:06.080 --> 01:10:11.120]  dissatisfied with its political class and its leadership we don't have the
[01:10:11.120 --> 01:10:15.840]  same over oppression but we have a very soft oppression of complacency and
[01:10:15.840 --> 01:10:20.480]  corruption he added caddell then made a bold claim of jaw-dropping scenes of
[01:10:20.480 --> 01:10:25.200]  rioting their civil war witnessed over the past few weeks on the streets of
[01:10:25.200 --> 01:10:30.720]  Kiev we're coming to America here's the quote and the American people what
[01:10:30.720 --> 01:10:35.960]  you're seeing there they need their own outlook for that it's a warning because
[01:10:35.960 --> 01:10:41.800]  it's coming full video and more of the transcript up on info wars calm I think
[01:10:41.800 --> 01:10:49.600]  that's a newsworthy story and what's also newsworthy and ties into this is
[01:10:49.600 --> 01:10:58.280]  what the Southern Poverty Law Center came out a few days ago and said more than
[01:10:58.280 --> 01:11:02.480]  half of white Americans are anti-black and they use some weird flim flam
[01:11:02.480 --> 01:11:09.680]  numbers that they dug up to say that now you're saying what does it do with
[01:11:09.680 --> 01:11:17.960]  revolt and Kiev and the Tea Party their only hope socially is to get everybody
[01:11:17.960 --> 01:11:26.480]  divided on race religion region sexual preference make that the issue so all
[01:11:26.480 --> 01:11:30.520]  the other rights can be taken and then we just fight over those and only see
[01:11:30.520 --> 01:11:36.320]  discrimination as coming from a racial or religious component not foreign banks
[01:11:36.320 --> 01:11:39.920]  looting us of tens of trillions of dollars a year not foreign banks getting
[01:11:39.920 --> 01:11:43.040]  rid of our due process and looting our bank accounts and stealing our pension
[01:11:43.040 --> 01:11:49.160]  funds not globalists using our tax money to fund all these wars they don't want
[01:11:49.160 --> 01:11:54.080]  us thinking along those lines they want us only thinking racially and that's the
[01:11:54.080 --> 01:11:57.920]  divide and conquer strategy they don't want us thinking about things like this
[01:11:57.920 --> 01:12:04.760]  either in Mississippi 72% of babies aborted are black
[01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:12.680]  26.6% are white so you can't get a black organization like the NAACP and all
[01:12:12.680 --> 01:12:16.880]  these groups run by the globalist to talk about that you can't get one Hispanic
[01:12:16.880 --> 01:12:19.720]  group to talk about the forced inoculation of every girl in Mexico
[01:12:19.720 --> 01:12:24.040]  with Gardasil on record that will cause autoimmune disorders in their
[01:12:24.040 --> 01:12:31.080]  reproductive tract and will actually kill a lot of them and that's on record
[01:12:31.080 --> 01:12:36.640]  now see I don't want unlimited illegal aliens from Latin American here because
[01:12:36.640 --> 01:12:41.520]  they're ignorant they have been dumbed down in a political system of fraud just
[01:12:41.520 --> 01:12:46.080]  like Americans and they will vote to take my guns they will vote to go along
[01:12:46.080 --> 01:12:50.760]  with the system and that's on record but I don't want them to be dead I care
[01:12:50.760 --> 01:12:56.640]  about them but see in a racial level it feels better just to hate me because I'm
[01:12:56.640 --> 01:13:01.840]  white it's like okay go ahead and abort the you know and go ahead and sterilize
[01:13:01.840 --> 01:13:06.280]  the Hispanic women you know that's loving and liberal but if you don't want
[01:13:06.280 --> 01:13:09.840]  us to come here and get free welfare and have our babies free and and then
[01:13:09.840 --> 01:13:16.560]  vote to take your guns well then you're a racist the truth is I don't like the
[01:13:16.560 --> 01:13:21.400]  political mindset of people in Latin America that have been taught that the
[01:13:21.400 --> 01:13:27.960]  only way to revolt is aka shea guavara communism the truth is if you weren't on
[01:13:27.960 --> 01:13:32.600]  welfare on average and if you weren't voting for political collectivism in
[01:13:32.600 --> 01:13:37.520]  my enslavement we need 30 million people from Mexico here because we've
[01:13:37.520 --> 01:13:45.760]  aborted the Hispanic black and white babies 55 million of them so it's what's
[01:13:45.760 --> 01:13:52.240]  going on between your ears that I don't like not the color of your skin and here
[01:13:52.240 --> 01:13:58.360]  it is right here 70% of black babies aborted but you're never going to hear
[01:13:58.360 --> 01:14:01.960]  the southern poverty law center that claims they care about black people
[01:14:01.960 --> 01:14:05.360]  Oprah Winfrey is gonna be financing a new Martin Luther King movie you know
[01:14:05.360 --> 01:14:09.040]  that's gonna be a bunch of race baiting will probably have Marlos or King of a
[01:14:09.040 --> 01:14:12.680]  speech and say you know you judge people on their color and what group they're
[01:14:12.680 --> 01:14:17.000]  part of not on the character of their deeds of course he said you don't judge
[01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:21.320]  people on their color you judge them on the content character of their deeds and
[01:14:21.320 --> 01:14:27.040]  what they stand for but this is how these groups are operating a racing
[01:14:27.040 --> 01:14:33.680]  history let's go ahead and play a clip of the southern poverty law center with
[01:14:33.680 --> 01:14:38.480]  its hundreds of millions a year and taxpayer money and the rest of it that
[01:14:38.480 --> 01:14:42.560]  demonizers truly and others and imply I'm a racist deeply racist as MSNBC says
[01:14:42.560 --> 01:14:47.720]  here they are race baiting saying half of whites that's the half that vote
[01:14:47.720 --> 01:14:53.560]  Republican are fundamentally anti-black even though they're fundamentally
[01:14:53.560 --> 01:14:56.960]  against aborting black babies they still are fundamentally against blacks
[01:14:56.960 --> 01:15:00.080]  because you know if you want to chop a baby up a black baby that's loving a
[01:15:00.080 --> 01:15:03.840]  liberal if you're against it it's because you're racist let's go ahead and go to the
[01:15:03.840 --> 01:15:10.800]  race pimp the race hustler po-talk there's polling that shows that both
[01:15:10.800 --> 01:15:16.280]  implicit and explicit anti-black attitudes among American whites have gone
[01:15:16.280 --> 01:15:23.080]  up quite significantly between 2008 and 2012 to the point where now more than
[01:15:23.080 --> 01:15:27.240]  half of white Americans have these anti-black attitudes half of white
[01:15:27.240 --> 01:15:30.840]  Americans have the real evidence right right on half of white Americans have
[01:15:30.840 --> 01:15:36.240]  anti-black attitudes are you white did you wake up this morning you're racist
[01:15:36.240 --> 01:15:40.720]  and I know the polls he's talking about they're in Gallup and others no you had
[01:15:40.720 --> 01:15:44.920]  a majority of whites that voted to elect Barack Obama and then everything
[01:15:44.920 --> 01:15:48.360]  turned into race baiting and everybody got told how racist they were and even
[01:15:48.360 --> 01:15:52.920]  liberal bleeding heart self-loathing white people are now getting mad and
[01:15:52.920 --> 01:15:56.680]  getting sick of being called names getting sick of being made fun of in the
[01:15:56.680 --> 01:16:00.640]  media getting sick of being attacked because we're white and people act like
[01:16:00.640 --> 01:16:04.240]  white people can't even turn on a light switch people act like white people are
[01:16:04.240 --> 01:16:08.720]  like the dumbest scum of the earth and beat them up shoot them attack them aha
[01:16:08.720 --> 01:16:12.800]  you're white white people are under attack in this country because the
[01:16:12.800 --> 01:16:16.560]  majority is the minorities you put the minorities together in this country now
[01:16:16.560 --> 01:16:20.280]  they're the majority and then the majority of women no matter what color
[01:16:20.280 --> 01:16:24.160]  they are vote for gun control open borders total socialism drones
[01:16:24.160 --> 01:16:29.200]  enslavement and that's why they think they've won folks and now they're gonna
[01:16:29.200 --> 01:16:33.440]  make it all about race politics and homeland security is for gun owners
[01:16:33.440 --> 01:16:37.760]  homeland security is for returning veterans homeland securities for the tea
[01:16:37.760 --> 01:16:41.720]  party which they've branded as white hoping quote minorities don't get
[01:16:41.720 --> 01:16:45.960]  involved in it and feel welcome in it because we can all be unified around a
[01:16:45.960 --> 01:16:49.640]  culture of liberty and get past what color we are that's what scares the
[01:16:49.640 --> 01:16:54.960]  system is real liberal thomas jeffersonian type ideas Dave in
[01:16:54.960 --> 01:16:58.720]  michigan you're on the air welcome
[01:16:58.720 --> 01:17:04.720]  who's not saying will bomb us I think he's pretty sane though I mean you know
[01:17:04.720 --> 01:17:08.280]  he's helping bring down the country for the globalist doing a great job I say
[01:17:08.280 --> 01:17:11.840]  Barack who's insane will bomb us and I think you're gonna use one of those
[01:17:11.840 --> 01:17:17.200]  nukes that he stole and detonated the one off of the coast of the carolina but
[01:17:17.200 --> 01:17:24.000]  I called yesterday and I really thought I I'd like to get my info back out because
[01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:27.120]  we were an overdrive and that doesn't get replayed listen listen here's the
[01:17:27.120 --> 01:17:32.000]  deal I got I got one pet peeve with collars everybody calls and does a call

[01:17:57.640 --> 01:18:05.960]  didn't he yes he still is an awesome but yeah Kevin lost faith in himself
[01:18:05.960 --> 01:18:10.600]  because he hasn't done anything with the information that you put out I believe
[01:18:10.600 --> 01:18:17.320]  your role is a messenger and you are putting out that in full war and you
[01:18:17.320 --> 01:18:22.640]  are turning hearts and minds and you are doing an awesome job I I'd like to tell
[01:18:22.640 --> 01:18:29.240]  you what I'm doing to resist I'm I'm using your sponsors by the way we've
[01:18:29.240 --> 01:18:37.800]  been making our own silver for probably six years from silver lungs.com and we
[01:18:37.800 --> 01:18:42.160]  learned about them from you and I haven't been sick or my family hasn't
[01:18:42.160 --> 01:18:45.560]  been sick since we've been making our own silver we have to know the silver

[01:18:57.880 --> 01:19:02.480]  tonsil cancer he let them take his tonsils they poured radiation down his
[01:19:02.480 --> 01:19:07.560]  throat a year later when he said he was healed he went back for a check out and
[01:19:07.560 --> 01:19:12.600]  guess what he had a growth on his thyroid which was inconclusive when they
[01:19:12.600 --> 01:19:17.360]  checked it for cancer but he still let him take the growth off of his thyroid so

[01:34:25.960 --> 01:34:29.800]  part of the united states but I wanted to get this gentleman on the story was
[01:34:29.800 --> 01:34:36.640]  put out last week by kit daniels and went viral man-wearing pro-gun t-shirt
[01:34:36.640 --> 01:34:41.640]  thrown out of voting booth in attack on free speech election official not
[01:34:41.640 --> 01:34:46.080]  serving says man can't vote because of shirt problem was he wasn't an illegal
[01:34:46.080 --> 01:34:51.360]  alien now what the law says in this state in other states is that you can't
[01:34:51.360 --> 01:34:56.520]  have a political shirt about who to vote for but you can certainly have one that
[01:34:56.520 --> 01:34:59.640]  says second amendment that'd be like having a certain that said first
[01:34:59.640 --> 01:35:03.120]  amendment this is the same thing we're in public schools they won't want to
[01:35:03.120 --> 01:35:06.760]  valoviktorians say they thank god or a football player that wins say they thank
[01:35:06.760 --> 01:35:10.720]  god or people can't hand out christmas cards that's your free speech that you
[01:35:10.720 --> 01:35:15.520]  personally you have free association it's at the school itself can't put out
[01:35:15.520 --> 01:35:19.840]  an official religion if it has state funding under separation church and
[01:35:19.840 --> 01:35:23.320]  state so they turn that around backwards but that's a separate issue this is just
[01:35:23.320 --> 01:35:28.920]  a first amendment issue straight up chris driscoll tell us about yourself he
[01:35:28.920 --> 01:35:33.160]  joins us via video skype and break down what happened the town you were in and
[01:35:33.160 --> 01:35:39.280]  kvue television also picked this up so this report's been confirmed this is
[01:35:39.280 --> 01:35:46.720]  going on are they trying to back up what they did to you no I haven't heard
[01:35:46.720 --> 01:35:51.480]  anything from from the local officials and I want to say thanks for allowing me
[01:35:51.480 --> 01:35:58.840]  on your show pretty much what I just believe it it's just another attack on
[01:35:58.840 --> 01:36:05.200]  free speech and voting rights through the color of law and just another example
[01:36:05.200 --> 01:36:13.080]  of demonization of gun owners on Tuesday February the 18th I went in to
[01:36:13.080 --> 01:36:20.800]  early vote and I was wearing this particular shirt and as I was entering
[01:36:20.800 --> 01:36:31.720]  the polling area they were asking me you know which which party which party I
[01:36:31.720 --> 01:36:34.680]  was going to which ballot I was going to be voting for in the Republican
[01:36:34.680 --> 01:36:41.760]  primary and I heard a gentleman heard a man back behind me state that I couldn't
[01:36:41.760 --> 01:36:46.880]  vote with that shirt on there was another female voice that that agreed
[01:36:46.880 --> 01:36:53.080]  with him and then they they said sir you'll have to you can't vote with that
[01:36:53.080 --> 01:36:58.400]  shirt on you'll have to turn it inside out or you won't be able to vote at first
[01:36:58.400 --> 01:37:02.880]  I was kind of dumbfounded it kind of shocked me and they told me I could go
[01:37:02.880 --> 01:37:07.360]  into another room turn it inside out for a moment actually entered that room and
[01:37:07.360 --> 01:37:12.880]  then got a little bit a little bit of clear thinking and I decided no that
[01:37:12.880 --> 01:37:17.480]  this isn't right I'm not and so I stepped out and told them I'm not turning
[01:37:17.480 --> 01:37:24.400]  anything inside out and that and I chose to leave at that time looking back
[01:37:24.400 --> 01:37:30.120]  later I might have kind of looking back on the situation if I had to do it again
[01:37:30.120 --> 01:37:33.400]  I probably would have challenged it a little bit more that's right that's
[01:37:33.400 --> 01:37:36.160]  right because they were trying to violate your civil rights keeping you
[01:37:36.160 --> 01:37:39.480]  from voting discriminating against you because you had a shirt that said
[01:37:39.480 --> 01:37:46.240]  second amendment 1789 in fact show TV viewers that are watching on Skype the
[01:37:46.240 --> 01:37:50.680]  shirt and I'll describe it it says the second amendment America's original
[01:37:50.680 --> 01:37:58.240]  homeland security 1789 with shotguns crossed with a skull over it and I just
[01:37:58.240 --> 01:38:02.960]  don't know that I mean that is not a electioneering that's not a candidate
[01:38:02.960 --> 01:38:07.360]  shirt that you're wearing well at the time I did ask the I asked the man the
[01:38:07.360 --> 01:38:10.840]  poll worker there that was telling me to turn the shirt inside out I ask him why
[01:38:10.840 --> 01:38:17.600]  and you know he didn't get into the fact that there was some type of that
[01:38:17.600 --> 01:38:22.960]  there was a proposition on the Republican ballot stating that Texan should
[01:38:22.960 --> 01:38:26.320]  support second amendment liberties by expanding locations were concealed
[01:38:26.320 --> 01:38:31.440]  hang in license holders may legally carry he just told me real quickly well
[01:38:31.440 --> 01:38:38.840]  that that's political and you can't wear anything political in here but it's not
[01:38:38.840 --> 01:38:44.320]  political it's a basic right and clearly it was discriminatory I wonder if you'd
[01:38:44.320 --> 01:38:50.600]  have been allowed to wear an Obama shirt in there yeah who knows what and you know
[01:38:50.600 --> 01:38:57.960]  I had a comment was someone asked me you know it stated that you know what they
[01:38:57.960 --> 01:39:01.520]  have turned away a Marine Corps shirt because a Marine Corps shirt because it
[01:39:01.520 --> 01:39:11.160]  had a picture of a gun on it you know who knows but I can tell you that it
[01:39:11.160 --> 01:39:15.680]  seemed like the tone of his voice and in the way that he stated his reasoning in
[01:39:15.680 --> 01:39:22.240]  the way that he spoke definitely seemed like to me it seemed like he had a
[01:39:22.240 --> 01:39:26.800]  major problem with my t-shirt you know my shirt didn't advocate for no party
[01:39:26.800 --> 01:39:35.040]  candidate or ballot measure it was just a it was just a you know stating a
[01:39:35.040 --> 01:39:39.600]  stating a lot of fact the second amendment if it had said something about
[01:39:39.600 --> 01:39:45.360]  you know vote yes or no on proposition 2 and then once again it's just a
[01:39:45.360 --> 01:39:50.080]  proposition you know these propositions they don't they don't elect anyone they
[01:39:50.080 --> 01:39:55.400]  don't determine any any type of law they're just really they're just an
[01:39:55.400 --> 01:40:04.800]  opinion they're just a poll so I think I really think that they just kind of
[01:40:04.800 --> 01:40:09.360]  stress the law here and under the color law they I think they may have done
[01:40:09.360 --> 01:40:15.080]  something illegal well that's exactly what's going on well Chris
[01:40:15.080 --> 01:40:20.920]  thanks for your testimony where is this going from here I mean I guess I guess
[01:40:20.920 --> 01:40:25.680]  next time you'll try to wear your second amendment shirt back in there again I'm
[01:40:25.680 --> 01:40:30.320]  probably really probably will or you know I have various other shirts and
[01:40:30.320 --> 01:40:34.000]  really you know a lot of people are thinking that I did this on purpose or
[01:40:34.000 --> 01:40:39.440]  I was trying to drum up some you know publicity honestly I I just put the
[01:40:39.440 --> 01:40:43.840]  shirt on that morning I went to have breakfast and on my way back I live
[01:40:43.840 --> 01:40:48.240]  fairly close with the courthouse I saw I saw that the early voting was happening
[01:40:48.240 --> 01:40:51.600]  and I happened to have my voter registration card with me that I'd
[01:40:51.600 --> 01:40:56.440]  recently gotten the mail so I went in and voted you know if I would have been
[01:40:56.440 --> 01:41:01.560]  on a mission here I probably would have been arrested but sure they always try
[01:41:01.560 --> 01:41:05.120]  to turn things around we see young men kicked out of school because they're
[01:41:05.120 --> 01:41:10.800]  wearing an NRA shirt saying the right to defend the rest we see the NFL banning
[01:41:10.800 --> 01:41:15.600]  pro gun ads but allowing video game ads showing mass murder I mean we see real
[01:41:15.600 --> 01:41:19.600]  discrimination against the free speech the first amendment to defend the
[01:41:19.600 --> 01:41:23.600]  second so they're trying to destroy our second by restricting our first and I'm
[01:41:23.600 --> 01:41:28.200]  glad you spoke out and drew attention to this thank you so much for spending
[01:41:28.200 --> 01:41:32.720]  time with us mr. Driscoll I appreciate it and I want to leave you with a good
[01:41:32.720 --> 01:41:35.840]  quote a favorite quote of mine from Thomas Jefferson states all tyranny
[01:41:35.840 --> 01:41:40.320]  needs to gain a foothold is for people of good conscience to remain silent that's
[01:41:40.320 --> 01:41:43.920]  right any other points you'd like to make well sir I do appreciate you having
[01:41:43.920 --> 01:41:49.160]  me on thank you so much for joining us all right folks we just wanted to get him
[01:41:49.160 --> 01:41:53.760]  on testimony to see another example of the persecution of the Second Amendment
[01:41:53.760 --> 01:41:58.800]  and it happens a lot where again you're shooting on your own ranch your
[01:41:58.800 --> 01:42:01.920]  neighbors aren't from a rural area they call the police on you the police still
[01:42:01.920 --> 01:42:06.080]  respond and act like you've done something wrong
[01:42:06.080 --> 01:42:10.400]  people wearing shirts with guns on them get questioned or thrown out of shopping
[01:42:10.400 --> 01:42:16.880]  malls and again it's only the image of a citizen with a gun that has been made to
[01:42:16.880 --> 01:42:21.760]  be anathema and so evil not the image of the state with guns I'm going to get
[01:42:21.760 --> 01:42:25.920]  into what's happening in the Ukraine and California smartphone kill switch
[01:42:25.920 --> 01:42:31.440]  proposal going nationwide here in just a moment and then your phone calls ahead
[01:42:31.440 --> 01:42:35.880]  of two special guests joining us coming up one on Skype one on in studio the
[01:42:35.880 --> 01:42:42.240]  awesome police chief Arte Sveta but before we go any further when you talk
[01:42:42.240 --> 01:42:46.680]  about the First Amendment it's important to realize that it defends the
[01:42:46.680 --> 01:42:50.080]  second and then it's important to realize that the second defends the first
[01:42:50.080 --> 01:42:55.720]  and vice versa they're all in mutual defense of each other we came out with
[01:42:55.720 --> 01:42:59.960]  two new shirts that are the bestseller of all time and info or store.com which is
[01:42:59.960 --> 01:43:04.120]  great it funds our operation then gets the word out it says Molan Labe in
[01:43:04.120 --> 01:43:10.240]  Greek and then under it it's got a very handsome Spartan helmet turned on its
[01:43:10.240 --> 01:43:19.560]  side or at an edge and then it's got two crossed M4 223 M16 variants with the
[01:43:19.560 --> 01:43:26.320]  victory laurel wreath on both sides and then says info wars under it and on the
[01:43:26.320 --> 01:43:32.840]  back it says info wars 1776 in Roman numerals and we have another version that
[01:43:32.840 --> 01:43:37.800]  just says info wars on the front and Molan Labe on the back but obviously the
[01:43:37.800 --> 01:43:42.440]  bestseller is the Molan Labe by itself and I came up with this design I like
[01:43:42.440 --> 01:43:46.000]  this design and it's made in America really nice fabric and very very
[01:43:46.000 --> 01:43:52.520]  affordable for how much this cost us to have our maiden 1776.com line of
[01:43:52.520 --> 01:43:58.160]  products and you can go to maiden 1776.com or link through to info or

[01:44:51.160 --> 01:44:54.720]  little splatter marks on it and stuff that we should probably put some more

[01:46:27.120 --> 01:46:32.640]  done just buying a shirt online but let me make Kevin a big deal but his call
[01:46:32.640 --> 01:46:36.080]  yesterday cast record with me and for those that don't know tell folks what
[01:46:36.080 --> 01:46:41.320]  Kevin said he said he's been lucid in 17 years and I'm not doing enough I'm not
[01:46:41.320 --> 01:46:45.280]  coming up with solutions I don't know what he's talking about yeah I mean I
[01:46:45.280 --> 01:46:50.480]  think where he's going with this is your your fight in the fight here I think you
[01:46:50.480 --> 01:46:54.280]  want you to be William Wallace and you're more of a Paul Revere type of
[01:46:54.280 --> 01:46:58.680]  you're you're you're alerting everybody and it's frustrating it's but a burden
[01:46:58.680 --> 01:47:03.080]  to be awake but I mean it's also very invigorating so you know when you when
[01:47:03.080 --> 01:47:06.760]  you see all these things going on and you've been spot on you've been 80% on
[01:47:06.760 --> 01:47:11.480]  another 20% you probably stopped or caused it to veer off and I don't know
[01:47:11.480 --> 01:47:15.520]  much time you spend thinking about you know I know you don't pat yourself on
[01:47:15.520 --> 01:47:19.840]  the back but I know that at some point you have to say man a job well done we've
[01:47:19.840 --> 01:47:23.200]  diverted another thing the subway thing I know that wasn't all of you and your
[01:47:23.200 --> 01:47:26.520]  listeners the boy tell you guys jumped on a cause and look what happened oh no
[01:47:26.520 --> 01:47:30.280]  we let me listen our listeners not just this show and my writers and our team
[01:47:30.280 --> 01:47:34.280]  we've been at the forefront of being the only people to challenge official
[01:47:34.280 --> 01:47:38.800]  narratives and then it turns out time and time again we were correct that's a
[01:47:38.800 --> 01:47:43.960]  dangerous position to be in by the way well absolutely and and I can only
[01:47:43.960 --> 01:47:48.120]  speculate on what he's thinking when he talked about Kaiser and Venture and all
[01:47:48.120 --> 01:47:51.760]  those guys and I listened to those guys as well and that have for years and that
[01:47:51.760 --> 01:47:56.680]  and and they're probably scared to death that you are so spot on and then
[01:47:56.680 --> 01:47:59.640]  maybe they do pick and choose like you say you pick and choose your battles
[01:47:59.640 --> 01:48:03.600]  maybe they pick and choose when they want to be your buddy I've never heard
[01:48:03.600 --> 01:48:06.720]  any derogatory things from them yeah I just think it was a big
[01:48:06.720 --> 01:48:11.360]  distractionary call you know we've got wide open phones here but I I just it
[01:48:11.360 --> 01:48:14.760]  doesn't matter what are we gonna do about the NSA spying on us without
[01:48:14.760 --> 01:48:19.320]  warrants and using economic data to corner markets and destroy freedom what
[01:48:19.320 --> 01:48:22.200]  are we gonna do about fluoride in the water what are we gonna do about them

[01:48:44.080 --> 01:48:47.840]  appreciate your call Rob you don't need to call in and defend me you know I've
[01:48:47.840 --> 01:48:51.560]  said this over and over again folks Cass Sunstein wrote this six years ago at
[01:48:51.560 --> 01:48:55.920]  the White House he said we go out and attack Liberty leaders and alternative
[01:48:55.920 --> 01:49:00.600]  media people will then defend them and then we'll make the whole news cycle
[01:49:00.600 --> 01:49:09.400]  about defending themselves rather than covering news so don't defend me I'm
[01:49:09.400 --> 01:49:15.640]  here to get the word out and to get people debating it I'm not here to win a
[01:49:15.640 --> 01:49:22.000]  popularity contest okay let's talk to Sid in Texas Sid you're on the air go
[01:49:22.000 --> 01:49:34.720]  ahead I got some advice for you man I was at the gun rally and to be honest I'd
[01:49:34.720 --> 01:49:38.800]  be at any rally you supported man I understand that you want to be the
[01:49:38.800 --> 01:49:43.160]  canary in the coal mine or whatever but we need leaders we need people to tell
[01:49:43.160 --> 01:49:46.480]  us what to do people people are thirsting for this stuff we don't know

[01:49:50.120 --> 01:49:53.400]  gave the first speech there since it happened in 1836 because they haven't
[01:49:53.400 --> 01:49:56.800]  allowed speeches there with Jerry Patterson I did a great job and we
[01:49:56.800 --> 01:50:00.800]  opened carried and made national news that's just one more battle out of
[01:50:00.800 --> 01:50:04.680]  thousands in the overall war but I mean I can I mean I'm running my own life
[01:50:04.680 --> 01:50:08.320]  here in my own operation I'm trying to just get people informed about what's
[01:50:08.320 --> 01:50:11.160]  going on I mean what else can I do because I'm not screening your calls and

[01:50:46.200 --> 01:50:52.240]  best interest at heart and are converting us from a free society to a

[01:54:07.360 --> 01:54:11.480]  I'm not mad at the earlier callers but when I open the phones up I said I want
[01:54:11.480 --> 01:54:16.280]  to get your take on Obamacare and the IRS officially saying they're going to
[01:54:16.280 --> 01:54:20.760]  take money out of your bank account and give you penalties and interest if you
[01:54:20.760 --> 01:54:25.360]  don't get the insurance or pay the five thousand dollar a year fine and it's
[01:54:25.360 --> 01:54:30.360]  even bigger for families I mean this is a big deal and it's in Americans for
[01:54:30.360 --> 01:54:35.840]  tax reform article on drudge report dot com and you link through to IRS dot gov
[01:54:35.840 --> 01:54:42.280]  and it's all right there I've got I think it's kit doing it might be a Don
[01:54:42.280 --> 01:54:45.320]  doing it doing an article our own article showing when they denied this
[01:54:45.320 --> 01:54:50.640]  last year when they passed the legislation versus what was in the bill
[01:54:50.640 --> 01:54:56.000]  and then what they're now doing but that's what's frustrating is this should
[01:54:56.000 --> 01:54:59.960]  die on its own it's clearly unconstitutional it's clearly a fraud I
[01:54:59.960 --> 01:55:04.560]  don't care what the Supreme Court says it's clearly a scam and now Obama is
[01:55:04.560 --> 01:55:09.640]  saying he will implement whatever he wants by piecemeal which is dictatorial
[01:55:09.640 --> 01:55:14.840]  and speaking of dictatorial there's video of this Obama eases penalties for
[01:55:14.840 --> 01:55:22.480]  businesses hiring illegal immigrants 40% decrease in fines belize rhetoric that's
[01:55:22.480 --> 01:55:33.280]  a Washington Times article and expanding on that they're already giving
[01:55:33.280 --> 01:55:36.800]  illegals all over the country drivers license they're letting them vote and
[01:55:36.800 --> 01:55:48.120]  then Joe Biden comes out and says that it's racist if you don't want illegals
[01:55:48.120 --> 01:55:54.640]  to be voting I mean this is the type of stuff that we're dealing with as a
[01:55:54.640 --> 01:56:02.080]  society and it's very very frustrating to see the lawlessness of this but then
[01:56:02.080 --> 01:56:07.120]  meanwhile you don't you know put your seatbelt on they'll take you to jail now
[01:56:07.120 --> 01:56:11.800]  that's what a tyranny is we're petty stuff they catch the general public in
[01:56:11.800 --> 01:56:15.160]  they pass all these laws make everybody a criminal but then the elites are all
[01:56:15.160 --> 01:56:19.720]  exempt from what they've put on the people just like Congress is across the
[01:56:19.720 --> 01:56:26.440]  board we're gonna go to your calls coming up in the next segment and Mike Adams

[02:00:38.000 --> 02:00:44.880]  what's happening and I've noticed this it seems like the US and the EU and a lot
[02:00:44.880 --> 02:00:50.040]  of these globalists are trying to emulate old Russia old Soviet Union they're
[02:00:50.040 --> 02:00:53.640]  drawing up this curtain okay they're the ones putting up the iron curtain now
[02:00:53.640 --> 02:00:58.800]  it's not Russia anymore Russia it's funny how the roles have switched Alex well
[02:00:58.800 --> 02:01:02.880]  actually a lot of members of the EU parliament like Nigel Farage and others
[02:01:02.880 --> 02:01:12.360]  they describe the EU as the new Soviet oh for sure Alex I mean look at it
[02:01:12.360 --> 02:01:18.520]  communism is is a thing in the future here as it is in the Soviet Union it was
[02:01:18.520 --> 02:01:22.280]  it's a thing of the past the rules have completely switched well that's how
[02:01:22.280 --> 02:01:28.680]  cycles that's how cycles work yeah yeah but you'd think that we you know
[02:01:28.680 --> 02:01:32.840]  it's treasuring our freedoms how much blood has been lost Alex trying to
[02:01:32.840 --> 02:01:38.480]  preserve our freedoms and it gets me really going to say you know to realize
[02:01:38.480 --> 02:01:43.200]  that we are so blatantly okay in response to Kevin I don't I honestly
[02:01:43.200 --> 02:01:47.600]  don't back Kevin up but I also not gonna stand up for you for that because I
[02:01:47.600 --> 02:01:53.320]  know being a long-time listener Kevin 17 years I understand a pessimism that
[02:01:53.320 --> 02:01:56.920]  goes along with this train of thought when you see everybody yeah and the
[02:01:56.920 --> 02:01:59.600]  people don't have to blame me that I'm covering what's going on and it's a
[02:01:59.600 --> 02:02:03.680]  serious battle we've got but I'm really talking about that caller thank you let's
[02:02:03.680 --> 02:02:10.200]  talk to the professor in Colorado you're on the air go ahead hi Alex I'm calling
[02:02:10.200 --> 02:02:14.000]  myself the professor because you asked me to develop I know I'm the plume you
[02:02:14.000 --> 02:02:19.400]  asked me a couple weeks ago to put together an article that talked about
[02:02:19.400 --> 02:02:24.840]  things that people could read to get themselves sort of on track as they're
[02:02:24.840 --> 02:02:30.160]  waking up and I've been working on that excuse me I didn't expect to be on so
[02:02:30.160 --> 02:02:38.960]  quickly and it's been occurring to me that there is a text that I don't know
[02:02:38.960 --> 02:02:46.160]  maybe you are very well aware of this that there's a text that discusses a
[02:02:46.160 --> 02:02:53.440]  civilization that was completely taken over by a criminal government and their
[02:02:53.440 --> 02:02:59.840]  religious leaders and their political leaders were all over taken by this
[02:02:59.840 --> 02:03:06.360]  the panic criminal organization and it's so mirrors the things that you talk
[02:03:06.360 --> 02:03:11.680]  about that I just was wondering if you've ever had the opportunity to read
[02:03:11.680 --> 02:03:16.160]  that text what text is it I don't know what text you're talking about sure I
[02:03:16.160 --> 02:03:22.440]  know it's the Book of Mormon no I've not read the book of I'm not read the
[02:03:22.440 --> 02:03:26.360]  Book of Mormon but I know it talks about government conspiracies and stuff I've
[02:03:26.360 --> 02:03:30.200]  read some read some of the stuff online some of the quotes pretty interesting
[02:03:30.200 --> 02:03:36.200]  now I'm an anthropologist I've worked at the Smithsonian I developed a number of
[02:03:36.200 --> 02:03:40.560]  inaugural permanent exhibits for the National Museum of the American Indians
[02:03:40.560 --> 02:03:47.120]  I'm not trying to advocate for any religion here but what is astonishing to
[02:03:47.120 --> 02:03:53.400]  me I just watched you on YouTube talk with text Mars for an hour and a half
[02:03:53.400 --> 02:04:00.120]  about things from last March and you two were talking about the fact that it's a
[02:04:00.120 --> 02:04:04.680]  very obvious that the people that we're dealing with who have taken over the
[02:04:04.680 --> 02:04:10.240]  government and our intent on doing all these really evil things clearly they're
[02:04:10.240 --> 02:04:17.040]  being motivated and directed by an evil intelligence and and as you and text were
[02:04:17.040 --> 02:04:23.480]  talking it you were saying that just in contrast it's very clear to you that
[02:04:23.480 --> 02:04:30.840]  you're receiving information from a sort of the opposite source and and when
[02:04:30.840 --> 02:04:35.760]  you said that I just was thinking boy you know I've really got to include the
[02:04:35.760 --> 02:04:39.520]  Book of Mormon in this list of tell us send along some of those passages you're
[02:04:39.520 --> 02:04:42.960]  talking about an email show tips at info wars.com an interesting call

[02:08:47.720 --> 02:08:52.360]  police chief set to be showing up here he's all over international news right
[02:08:52.360 --> 02:08:55.880]  now for his comments about hey at least Austin police aren't raping women in the
[02:08:55.880 --> 02:09:01.760]  streets like other cities so we'll get him to elaborate on that coming up and
[02:09:01.760 --> 02:09:07.080]  say whatever you want about Artisa Veta he's got he's got large wavos to be
[02:09:07.080 --> 02:09:15.120]  able to come in here and face the music over and over again he is mr. slick all
[02:09:15.120 --> 02:09:20.080]  right we are joined in this segment and into the next by the health ranger
[02:09:20.080 --> 02:09:24.800]  naturalnews.com he's got his natural news health labs as well or he tests
[02:09:24.800 --> 02:09:29.880]  different products out there and he joins us to talk about an article that we
[02:09:29.880 --> 02:09:34.640]  had up on info wars.com today that he wrote for naturalnews.com Google
[02:09:34.640 --> 02:09:40.560]  robots Kurzweil's AI and why self-aware machines will inevitably seek to
[02:09:40.560 --> 02:09:43.560]  destroy humanity and that's what all the other top scientists are saying but
[02:09:43.560 --> 02:09:47.160]  they'll just squash us like a bug and Kurzweil doesn't believe in God yet he's
[02:09:47.160 --> 02:09:52.880]  as he will become God so I wanted to get Mike who's a really good programmer and
[02:09:52.880 --> 02:09:57.720]  engineer in his own right to get his take on where the architecture of this
[02:09:57.720 --> 02:10:01.880]  is going because it's not that I'm against computers it's that all of them
[02:10:01.880 --> 02:10:07.880]  are having back doors built into them look at this article California's
[02:10:07.880 --> 02:10:12.960]  smartphone kill switch proposal going nationwide lawmakers in Illinois have
[02:10:12.960 --> 02:10:16.760]  introduced a bill that gives the police a code they broadcast that turns
[02:10:16.760 --> 02:10:20.960]  everybody's smartphone off so you can't videotape or tweet the smart meters have
[02:10:20.960 --> 02:10:24.080]  this the cars have it when they take three parents and make a quote
[02:10:24.080 --> 02:10:29.240]  humanoid they admit it's not really a human they can add whatever restrictions
[02:10:29.240 --> 02:10:35.400]  they want psychologically into it the we are in a buck Rogers type event so I
[02:10:35.400 --> 02:10:39.880]  want to get into the rise of the robots first but what about the rise of
[02:10:39.880 --> 02:10:45.360]  nanotech the rise of virus-based vaccines that change brain chemistry to
[02:10:45.360 --> 02:10:50.360]  make you more submissive this isn't coming this is here being tested on the
[02:10:50.360 --> 02:10:56.440]  trips we are in 2014 Mike Adams hey Alex great to be joining you again great
[02:10:56.440 --> 02:11:02.280]  intro very serious issues for the future of humankind I think the rise of the
[02:11:02.280 --> 02:11:06.360]  robots that the two issues to really discuss here are the intentions of
[02:11:06.360 --> 02:11:11.400]  those like Google and Ray Kurzweil and others but then there's the unintended
[02:11:11.400 --> 02:11:15.880]  consequences that are likely to emerge from this on the intentional side I
[02:11:15.880 --> 02:11:20.960]  think you and I would both agree that they humans long-term from from the
[02:11:20.960 --> 02:11:25.440]  globalist point of view humans are replaceable by robots they don't need
[02:11:25.440 --> 02:11:30.160]  humanity as much as we would hope they they want to develop robots to replace
[02:11:30.160 --> 02:11:34.160]  soldiers to replace factory where they say that decision has been made yes
[02:11:34.160 --> 02:11:38.480]  right so so that's deliberate we know that's going to happen but the
[02:11:38.480 --> 02:11:43.880]  unintended consequence is that these robots which are going to have high
[02:11:43.880 --> 02:11:47.520]  level advanced AI Google has been buying up all these artificial intelligence
[02:11:47.520 --> 02:11:52.080]  neural networking companies there will be an intelligence explosion and that's a
[02:11:52.080 --> 02:11:55.920]  term from the realm of artificial intelligence to where these machines
[02:11:55.920 --> 02:12:00.880]  will outsmart outthink and outmaneuver human beings and then take over and then
[02:12:00.880 --> 02:12:05.800]  decide that humans are the problem sounds like science fiction but there are a
[02:12:05.800 --> 02:12:09.760]  lot of very highly intelligent people who are seriously writing about this
[02:12:09.760 --> 02:12:15.680]  studying this issue and trying to find ways to keep high IQ high AI excuse me
[02:12:15.680 --> 02:12:20.760]  contained and the conclusion is that you can't because at some point they
[02:12:20.760 --> 02:12:25.000]  become more intelligent than even the smartest most brilliant people we Ray
[02:12:25.000 --> 02:12:29.520]  Kurzweil is brilliant he's a high IQ individual no one can argue with that but
[02:12:29.520 --> 02:12:34.680]  computers with AI can even exceed his intelligence and the intelligence of all
[02:12:34.680 --> 02:12:39.600]  humans combined how are you going to contain that the only rational conclusion
[02:12:39.600 --> 02:12:44.120]  is that you can't so this is headed to a very dark time where we may be at war
[02:12:44.120 --> 02:12:48.000]  with the machines Alex that's right and if you read what Kurzweil's written but
[02:12:48.000 --> 02:12:52.960]  not just Kurzweil Bill Joy in Wired Magazine in April 2000 and really the
[02:12:52.960 --> 02:12:57.080]  the compendium of their work there's not debate about it they've made the
[02:12:57.080 --> 02:13:01.480]  decision in an evolutionary way to advocate responsibility and just say
[02:13:01.480 --> 02:13:05.760]  whatever's gonna happen is gonna happen and so they're in a race to whoever can
[02:13:05.760 --> 02:13:10.680]  create the life extension systems and for whoever can merge with machines the
[02:13:10.680 --> 02:13:15.760]  fastest they say it's a foregone conclusion it can't be stopped so they've
[02:13:15.760 --> 02:13:20.400]  just given into it meanwhile the general public has no idea this is even
[02:13:20.400 --> 02:13:26.280]  being prepared well exactly and Ray Kurzweil just put out an interview I
[02:13:26.280 --> 02:13:30.400]  guess a week ago where he predicted that machines would be more
[02:13:30.400 --> 02:13:35.600]  intelligent than humans by the year 2029 I believe is what he said that's not
[02:13:35.600 --> 02:13:40.520]  very far off and this guy has a knack of being right about technology
[02:13:40.520 --> 02:13:43.800]  predictions I hope that's also because we know in the government and corporate
[02:13:43.800 --> 02:13:47.880]  reservations the technology's 30 to 40 years advanced it's just in the
[02:13:47.880 --> 02:13:52.920]  development stage they don't roll it out on us till way past beta that's right
[02:13:52.920 --> 02:13:58.560]  now I've been reading this book by James Barat it's called our final invention
[02:13:58.560 --> 02:14:02.920]  and just just sort of plug in that book because it's an important read for
[02:14:02.920 --> 02:14:07.840]  humanity this book really gets into the technical details of the intelligence
[02:14:07.840 --> 02:14:12.720]  explosion and and even experiment that have been conducted to see if computers
[02:14:12.720 --> 02:14:17.320]  can outsmart humans and escape any kind of boundaries that scientists have tried
[02:14:17.320 --> 02:14:23.600]  to put on them and in almost every case the the the AI systems or simulated AI
[02:14:23.600 --> 02:14:28.320]  systems have escaped so because we're interconnected the world is networked
[02:14:28.320 --> 02:14:32.240]  everything is driven by scripts look at the economy look at Wall Street look at
[02:14:32.240 --> 02:14:37.520]  the nuclear power plants they're driven by computer code and they're not secure
[02:14:37.520 --> 02:14:42.400]  we've seen Stuxnet successfully invade nuclear power facilities already China
[02:14:42.400 --> 02:14:48.680]  is is in a an information technology war what if you have an entity that is
[02:14:48.680 --> 02:14:54.040]  highly intelligent that is not human it is robotic it is it is a machine that
[02:14:54.040 --> 02:14:58.560]  that wants to declare war on humanity and that can break any code that can beat
[02:14:58.560 --> 02:15:02.520]  any encryption that's actually covered in another science fiction book called
[02:15:02.520 --> 02:15:08.440]  demon by Daniel Suarez which is a really great read but also probably more
[02:15:08.440 --> 02:15:13.560]  nonfiction than fiction so this is really look at the Skynet scenario they've
[02:15:13.560 --> 02:15:16.920]  already got the autonomous drones it's all launching humans are being taken out
[02:15:16.920 --> 02:15:21.000]  of the equation and undoubtedly because the machines are being built and given
[02:15:21.000 --> 02:15:26.640]  the warlike human attributes that it's not a question of if but when it's going
[02:15:26.640 --> 02:15:30.160]  to make the decision to take humans out of the equation so that it can be
[02:15:30.160 --> 02:15:34.160]  dominant on the face of the earth and this is why in my article I pointed out
[02:15:34.160 --> 02:15:39.840]  that America is uniquely positioned and especially Texas uniquely positioned to
[02:15:39.840 --> 02:15:46.760]  have a kinetic defense against these war robots that might be unleashed one day
[02:15:46.760 --> 02:15:51.600]  to actually destroy humanity and like has been a quoted in science fiction
[02:15:51.600 --> 02:15:56.320]  novels we could actually be in a war of biologicals versus the machines you know
[02:15:56.320 --> 02:16:01.200]  terminator type of scenario it's not science fiction anymore now Texans in
[02:16:01.200 --> 02:16:07.000]  particular you know Texans are they've got guns and ammo like crazy you know and
[02:16:07.000 --> 02:16:11.120]  and and pears Morgan isn't even going to be around anymore to complain about it
[02:16:11.120 --> 02:16:17.800]  thank goodness Texans could actually possibly defeat robots in a physical
[02:16:17.800 --> 02:16:22.760]  war where other countries that don't have a built-in infrastructure of self
[02:16:22.760 --> 02:16:27.520]  defense would really be at the mercy of humanoid robots in an AI takeover
[02:16:27.520 --> 02:16:32.920]  scenarios that's something to really think about I agree with you the main
[02:16:32.920 --> 02:16:36.040]  way they're going to attack is in collaborative efforts with humans
[02:16:36.040 --> 02:16:41.120]  because the elite are already designing the computers and the robots to replace
[02:16:41.120 --> 02:16:44.800]  humans and have the medical robots go out with the force inoculations that
[02:16:44.800 --> 02:16:48.640]  have the nanotech viruses that go in and quote relieve the stress areas of the
[02:16:48.640 --> 02:16:54.160]  brain by actually eating the synapses and so they're going to roll out with a
[02:16:54.160 --> 02:16:59.960]  bio bio weapon cutting edge I mean that that'll be the problem facing these
[02:16:59.960 --> 02:17:05.120]  robots is they're already going to be interfaced with a weapon system that was
[02:17:05.120 --> 02:17:10.080]  anti-human to begin with and so there is so its mission statement is going to be
[02:17:10.080 --> 02:17:18.000]  exterminate along the lines of a 21st century Daleks from Dr. Hood it is
[02:17:18.000 --> 02:17:22.840]  frighteningly easy to end biological life if you are an advanced AI system
[02:17:22.840 --> 02:17:27.960]  that controls nuclear power water delivery the power grid I mean all an AI
[02:17:27.960 --> 02:17:31.760]  system would have to do is crash the power grid for six months that would kill
[02:17:31.760 --> 02:17:35.880]  most humans that live in in the modern world right there without even firing a
[02:17:35.880 --> 02:17:40.480]  single shot so you're right there there are vulnerabilities that we have built
[02:17:40.480 --> 02:17:47.040]  into our modern civilization some some real incredible weaknesses and only a
[02:17:47.040 --> 02:17:50.240]  few individuals are really trying to build redundant systems and live off
[02:17:50.240 --> 02:17:54.600]  grid and and have sustainable power supplies and food supplies and self
[02:17:54.600 --> 02:17:58.040]  defense and all of these things they will be the survivors of course but
[02:17:58.040 --> 02:18:01.120]  you're right there will be human collaborators with the AI system who
[02:18:01.120 --> 02:18:06.960]  will be promised protection and food and power in order to collaborate with
[02:18:06.960 --> 02:18:11.120]  the war against humanity that's going to happen and again I know this sounds
[02:18:11.120 --> 02:18:15.280]  like science fiction but it's time for us to really seriously consider this
[02:18:15.280 --> 02:18:21.680]  because AI is is it's here and it's getting more intelligent with each passing
[02:18:21.680 --> 02:18:26.680]  day and the intelligence explosion that that's commonly referred to in AI
[02:18:26.680 --> 02:18:33.760]  scientific papers is is also very very real human intelligence cannot expand
[02:18:33.760 --> 02:18:38.640]  in a logarithmic fashion like AI can so we better be thinking about this now or
[02:18:38.640 --> 02:18:42.600]  we may not be around in a hundred years that's right and the elite can't just
[02:18:42.600 --> 02:18:47.960]  wave a wand and say oh well we'll merge with it we're gonna be fine as as as
[02:18:47.960 --> 02:18:51.520]  Ray Kurzweil and others have said and they've made the decision this is the
[02:18:51.520 --> 02:18:55.440]  way it's going and again are building Trojan horse systems of human control
[02:18:55.440 --> 02:19:02.840]  into everything for oppression and control and so it's guaranteeing that the
[02:19:02.840 --> 02:19:08.400]  AI systems that develop will be anti-human that's the problem is that
[02:19:08.400 --> 02:19:14.760]  anti-humans anti-human humans eugenics based humans humans that are wanting to
[02:19:14.760 --> 02:19:20.080]  suppress other humans not empower them are literally putting their spirit like
[02:19:20.080 --> 02:19:25.280]  soar on into the ring into the computer that's the problem no clearly
[02:19:25.280 --> 02:19:31.020]  there there's an anti-life agenda in this and it's it's not even shrouded in
[02:19:31.020 --> 02:19:35.200]  secrecy anymore look at the Boston Dynamics robots which were now purchased
[02:19:35.200 --> 02:19:39.600]  by Google and they taught these robots a game that they call follow the leader
[02:19:39.600 --> 02:19:43.960]  well it's really a game of stalk the human because they have a guy running
[02:19:43.960 --> 02:19:48.240]  through a field and the robot can follow the guy well that's how you chase down
[02:19:48.240 --> 02:19:51.920]  and kill humans you mount you know it that's right and when the Marines trained
[02:19:51.920 --> 02:19:56.040]  to kill us citizens they call it a zombie drill we're gonna come back and
[02:19:56.040 --> 02:20:03.240]  talk about the polio situation with Mike Adams it's time to kick some ash

[02:24:41.680 --> 02:24:50.080]  back so I brought him down here what's the matter Sark you look nervous well I
[02:24:50.080 --> 02:25:01.560]  was just I don't know a user I mean users wrote us the user even wrote you
[02:25:01.560 --> 02:25:07.960]  no one user wrote me I'm worth millions of their man years what if I can't you
[02:25:07.960 --> 02:25:33.320]  rather take your chances with me and we go from fiction to fact as the
[02:25:33.320 --> 02:25:37.800]  automated drones have been in the skies for over a decade autonomous operating

[02:25:41.080 --> 02:25:45.040]  going on finishing up with the whole robot takeover I think people are
[02:25:45.040 --> 02:25:48.800]  starting to realize this and get concerned but Mike we've only got about
[02:25:48.800 --> 02:25:52.720]  four minutes left I appreciate Mike Adams coming on doctors studying polio
[02:25:52.720 --> 02:25:56.600]  like illness flooded with calls now there's hundreds of cases first it was
[02:25:56.600 --> 02:26:02.000]  five and 20 than hundreds of polio like but it's not polio and then I pulled up
[02:26:02.000 --> 02:26:08.320]  the articles where most of the paralysis in India and other places is after the
[02:26:08.320 --> 02:26:12.440]  vaccines there's a headline paralysis cases spike in wake of Bill Gates polio
[02:26:12.440 --> 02:26:16.640]  vaccine effort in India what do you think's behind this Mike Adams it's
[02:26:16.640 --> 02:26:21.680]  very clear Alex this is a massive cover-up of paralysis being caused by
[02:26:21.680 --> 02:26:27.840]  the vaccines I'm looking at a CNN story to here one of the few times I actually
[02:26:27.840 --> 02:26:32.920]  managed to read CNN but because they're reporting this this this lie that they
[02:26:32.920 --> 02:26:37.560]  don't doctors don't know what's causing the illness all five children that had
[02:26:37.560 --> 02:26:43.680]  been vaccinated that had paralysis had been vaccinated against polio so time
[02:26:43.680 --> 02:26:47.120]  and time again we see that the vaccine is causing the disease that it claims to
[02:26:47.120 --> 02:26:51.440]  treat then vaccine pushers and zealots throw up their hands and say well we
[02:26:51.440 --> 02:26:54.400]  don't know what's causing this illness but everybody better hurry up and get
[02:26:54.400 --> 02:26:58.240]  vaccinated that's the only defense so more more parents get their children
[02:26:58.240 --> 02:27:02.960]  vaccinated more paralysis emerges and the cycle repeats itself Alex it's a
[02:27:02.960 --> 02:27:09.720]  it's a marketing scheme it's it's it's a crime against children it's bad medicine
[02:27:09.720 --> 02:27:13.760]  it's junk science it's the vaccine is causing the illness we see it with
[02:27:13.760 --> 02:27:18.280]  meals measles and mumps also every time there's a measles outbreak if you look
[02:27:18.280 --> 02:27:22.240]  at the kids that get infected it's those who were vaccinated it's the
[02:27:22.240 --> 02:27:25.780]  unvaccinated my dad has hundreds of patients that have come in over the
[02:27:25.780 --> 02:27:30.120]  years saying they got shingles from the shingles vaccine absolutely it's well
[02:27:30.120 --> 02:27:34.560]  documented and look you take you take some healthy kids raised in Texas that
[02:27:34.560 --> 02:27:38.160]  are raised on a farm with farm animals and their home school then they're not
[02:27:38.160 --> 02:27:42.560]  vaccinated they're the healthiest kids you'll ever meet and I met lots of
[02:27:42.560 --> 02:27:45.720]  families like that and you know what I'm talking about because you know kids like
[02:27:45.720 --> 02:27:49.760]  that too they're super healthy they're not paralyzed they're not vaccinated
[02:27:49.760 --> 02:27:55.840]  vaccines Alex I'm sorry go ahead no no no but it's just they admit in overseas
[02:27:55.840 --> 02:28:01.520]  that it's the polio vaccine paralyzing them but they don't call it polio
[02:28:01.520 --> 02:28:05.480]  vaccine I talked to a pediatrician years ago told me they still give the oral
[02:28:05.480 --> 02:28:11.080]  here in East Austin to the poor kids all over the country go ahead well you know
[02:28:11.080 --> 02:28:16.160]  the flu shot makes you more susceptible to the flu osteoporosis drugs cause
[02:28:16.160 --> 02:28:21.920]  osteoporosis anti-depressant drugs cause depression Alzheimer's drugs call cause
[02:28:21.920 --> 02:28:27.480]  Alzheimer's it's this is the marketing system of big pharma it is cause illness
[02:28:27.480 --> 02:28:32.540]  and then claim to treat it and then repeat it's so insidious and yet it's so
[02:28:32.540 --> 02:28:38.360]  simple but the cover-up is so immense that the mainstream public isn't aware
[02:28:38.360 --> 02:28:42.920]  that they're being used as a revenue generation generating getting
[02:28:42.920 --> 02:28:46.880]  well it's now come out as well as something we knew decades ago are causing
[02:28:46.880 --> 02:28:53.720]  cancer neurological disorders more suicide that the whole revenue model of
[02:28:53.720 --> 02:28:58.360]  the cancer industry is to make sure that people don't prevent cancer and that
[02:28:58.360 --> 02:29:02.520]  they don't learn about anti-cancer foods and then wait for them to get cancer
[02:29:02.520 --> 02:29:06.520]  diagnose them and then treat them for very high profits and build a federal
[02:29:06.520 --> 02:29:11.720]  government Medicare or state Medicaid programs or Obamacare make money off of
[02:29:11.720 --> 02:29:15.720]  people's suffering and people's disease that's been the model in medicine now for
[02:29:15.720 --> 02:29:20.360]  decades and it's gonna crash by the way because that model doesn't work long term
[02:29:20.360 --> 02:29:24.240]  but until then a lot of people will suffer just like Obamacare is a short

[02:36:16.640 --> 02:36:18.640]  Complaining will be put in prison.
[02:36:18.640 --> 02:36:20.640]  Joking will be put in prison.
[02:36:20.640 --> 02:36:22.640]  Terrorist.
[02:36:22.640 --> 02:36:24.640]  All the government runs all over the public.
[02:36:24.640 --> 02:36:26.640]  TSA searching everybody.
[02:36:26.640 --> 02:36:28.640]  He's bored doing nothing.
[02:36:28.640 --> 02:36:30.640]  Police sees a good-looking woman.
[02:36:30.640 --> 02:36:32.640]  This guy's being waved through as a rifle.
[02:36:40.640 --> 02:36:42.640]  This is a good-looking senior reaper.
[02:36:42.640 --> 02:36:48.640]  They got the naked body scanners.
[02:37:02.640 --> 02:37:04.640]  Got the trendy mustache.
[02:37:04.640 --> 02:37:06.640]  What's the good-looking woman in the naked body scanner?
[02:37:06.640 --> 02:37:08.640]  They're on record, by the way.
[02:37:08.640 --> 02:37:10.640]  Looking at that.
[02:37:10.640 --> 02:37:12.640]  They're on record, and they crowd copies and save it.
[02:37:12.640 --> 02:37:14.640]  They make fun of people's genitals.
[02:37:22.640 --> 02:37:24.640]  He's got his plastic glove on.
[02:37:24.640 --> 02:37:26.640]  He has to do a search of her.
[02:37:30.640 --> 02:37:32.640]  Now, what it really gets into is the pre-screening.
[02:37:32.640 --> 02:37:34.640]  When you're at home.
[02:37:34.640 --> 02:37:36.640]  Shit, Johnson!
[02:37:36.640 --> 02:37:40.640]  TSA WONDERKIND.
[02:37:44.640 --> 02:37:46.640]  Got a guy at home on his computer.
[02:37:50.640 --> 02:37:52.640]  Done.
[02:37:52.640 --> 02:37:54.640]  Alright, I'll be flying out on the 23rd.
[02:37:54.640 --> 02:37:56.640]  If you land around 2 p.m.
[02:37:56.640 --> 02:37:58.640]  Okay.
[02:37:58.640 --> 02:38:00.640]  I love you too, sis.
[02:38:00.640 --> 02:38:02.640]  Alright, bye.
[02:38:02.640 --> 02:38:04.640]  Pre-crime.
[02:38:04.640 --> 02:38:06.640]  Hello, Michael.
[02:38:10.640 --> 02:38:12.640]  Who are you?
[02:38:12.640 --> 02:38:14.640]  My name is Dick Johnson.
[02:38:14.640 --> 02:38:16.640]  I'm just your friendly TSA field agent.
[02:38:16.640 --> 02:38:18.640]  I'm just here to conduct a little
[02:38:18.640 --> 02:38:20.640]  pre-security screening.
[02:38:22.640 --> 02:38:24.640]  Okay?
[02:38:24.640 --> 02:38:26.640]  He's rubbing on him.
[02:38:26.640 --> 02:38:28.640]  Wait, how did you even know I was flying?
[02:38:28.640 --> 02:38:30.640]  Oh, Mikey.
[02:38:30.640 --> 02:38:32.640]  Don't call me that.
[02:38:32.640 --> 02:38:34.640]  Well, I'm part of a new TSA initiative
[02:38:34.640 --> 02:38:36.640]  to screen certain
[02:38:36.640 --> 02:38:38.640]  high-risk travelers.
[02:38:38.640 --> 02:38:40.640]  That's not even true.
[02:38:40.640 --> 02:38:42.640]  They're mainlining everybody going into a database
[02:38:42.640 --> 02:38:44.640]  as an excuse to doubt them.
[02:38:44.640 --> 02:38:46.640]  I'm not saying that.
[02:38:46.640 --> 02:38:48.640]  I'm not saying that.
[02:38:48.640 --> 02:38:50.640]  I'm not saying that.
[02:38:50.640 --> 02:38:52.640]  I'm not saying that.
[02:38:52.640 --> 02:38:54.640]  I'm not saying that.
[02:38:54.640 --> 02:38:56.640]  I'm not saying that.
[02:38:56.640 --> 02:38:58.640]  I'm not saying that.
[02:38:58.640 --> 02:39:00.640]  I'm not saying that.
[02:39:00.640 --> 02:39:02.640]  If you're not even going into a databases
[02:39:02.640 --> 02:39:04.640]  as an excuse to data mine
[02:39:04.640 --> 02:39:06.640]  and the mainline NSA spying, that's all else.
[02:39:06.640 --> 02:39:08.640]  You're a white, gun-owning,
[02:39:08.640 --> 02:39:10.640]  20-something Christian man
[02:39:10.640 --> 02:39:12.640]  who wrote in Ron Paul in two elections
[02:39:12.640 --> 02:39:14.640]  and has a positive truck-full
[02:39:14.640 --> 02:39:16.640]  of anti-government propaganda.
[02:39:16.640 --> 02:39:18.640]  So, since you fit the domestic
[02:39:18.640 --> 02:39:20.640]  terrorist profile to a T,
[02:39:20.640 --> 02:39:22.640]  the lovely folks at the TSA
[02:39:22.640 --> 02:39:24.640]  just wanted me to come down here
[02:39:24.640 --> 02:39:26.640]  so I can make sure that you're safe to travel.
[02:39:26.640 --> 02:39:28.640]  Now, I assure you
[02:39:28.640 --> 02:39:33.180]  process at the airport much smoother and if everything checks out you won't have
[02:39:33.180 --> 02:39:37.280]  to do a cavity search there oh that's good yeah we're just gonna go ahead and
[02:39:37.280 --> 02:39:40.400]  take care of that right here in the privacy and convenience of your own
[02:39:40.400 --> 02:39:46.680]  bathroom what but first I just have just a few questions okay what is your
[02:39:46.680 --> 02:39:56.240]  business in Albuquerque and are you smuggling meth for Heisenberg uh no
[02:39:56.240 --> 02:40:02.600]  you realize that's just a TV show right what is your business there I'm
[02:40:02.600 --> 02:40:09.800]  actually going there to see my sister she's got cancer they don't know if
[02:40:09.800 --> 02:40:12.600]  she's gonna make it
[02:40:16.680 --> 02:40:20.280]  where does your sister get radioactive materials and where is she planning on
[02:40:20.280 --> 02:40:38.960]  detonating that dirty bomb dude what the dick Johnson next time on dick Johnson
[02:40:38.960 --> 02:40:44.560]  literally folks all it is is an excuse for the power structure to power grab
[02:40:44.560 --> 02:40:50.640]  and list us all as criminals so that they can steal all of our data and use it
[02:40:50.640 --> 02:40:55.960]  against us that's what's going on and by every benchmark this is a tyrannical
[02:40:55.960 --> 02:40:59.800]  system look at how they lied to you about Obamacare when the bill said they
[02:40:59.800 --> 02:41:03.880]  take money out of your bank account $5,000 penalties and interest if you
[02:41:03.880 --> 02:41:06.640]  didn't get Obamacare and they said oh that's not in there and now they
[02:41:06.640 --> 02:41:10.080]  admit it's in there in the IRS is implementing it they didn't hire 17,000
[02:41:10.080 --> 02:41:15.440]  agents to implement that for no reason they did that because that was the plan
[02:41:15.440 --> 02:41:22.800]  and that's now been announced today so the answer is speak out against it say
[02:41:22.800 --> 02:41:29.760]  no to it expose the giant stinking fraud that it is in fact our article on
[02:41:29.760 --> 02:41:33.760]  this just went up that integrates all the news together IRS prepared to enforce

[02:41:56.480 --> 02:42:02.360]  disgusting that they denied this all those times and then now there it is in
[02:42:02.360 --> 02:42:09.320]  your face with the IRS is the enforcers of all this new social engineering and I

[02:42:55.880 --> 02:43:03.400]  yeah absolutely talking about Obamacare or the Affordable Care Act seems like
[02:43:03.400 --> 02:43:07.080]  it's about five million knuckleheads that have lost their health care at this
[02:43:07.080 --> 02:43:15.200]  point yes I mean people I'm sorry it just it amazes me and they were they
[02:43:15.200 --> 02:43:19.880]  were shooting for like 2.8 million signups they got 3.3 and lost five

[02:43:34.080 --> 02:43:38.680]  lying and where is the Republican leadership repealing this yeah I
[02:43:38.680 --> 02:43:41.800]  totally expected it I mean when they started taking money from the banks in
[02:43:41.800 --> 02:43:46.400]  Europe I mean I was listening to you I mean you warned us all ahead of time but
[02:43:46.400 --> 02:43:49.680]  I mean I knew it was coming it was just a matter of when and how they were gonna
[02:43:49.680 --> 02:43:55.160]  put that into place of course Obamacare is a perfect one to do it on a second
[02:43:55.160 --> 02:44:00.840]  note this crap and if I can say crap this crap that's going on in Connecticut

[02:44:29.040 --> 02:44:32.520]  they're getting letters back saying no turn in all your semi-automatic firearms
[02:44:32.520 --> 02:44:36.680]  and you're we're not gonna let you register them and the letters up on

[02:45:01.160 --> 02:45:05.040]  four reporters and I don't have the infrastructure or the money right now to
[02:45:05.040 --> 02:45:09.120]  constantly send everybody everywhere I mean gun owners up there should be up in
[02:45:09.120 --> 02:45:13.800]  arms politically to reverse this I mean this is this is really happening I
[02:45:13.800 --> 02:45:18.240]  appreciate your call people should at least get this article out to everybody

[02:45:23.640 --> 02:45:30.320]  there yes sir hey yeah actually I just want to remind you about Mike Lee up
[02:45:30.320 --> 02:45:36.480]  here he is trying to repeal Obamacare and of course he was one that the led
[02:45:36.480 --> 02:45:41.400]  fight tried to defend defund it in the first place but there's a lot of great
[02:45:41.400 --> 02:45:46.760]  video on YouTube with Mike Lee in the argument about Obamacare and and there's
[02:45:46.760 --> 02:45:54.960]  a really great one it's listed here as Obama's crack pipe and but but there's
[02:45:54.960 --> 02:46:00.520]  some great videos on that and then I had one other comment that I had is it
[02:46:00.520 --> 02:46:05.480]  began with saying well what do we do you know you're and I agree you're you're
[02:46:05.480 --> 02:46:09.400]  the info water the guy that gives us that information once we have that
[02:46:09.400 --> 02:46:14.600]  information then we need to take it to our congressmen our senators and start
[02:46:14.600 --> 02:46:18.480]  getting politically involved in our local government so that's actually what
[02:46:18.480 --> 02:46:23.760]  I've done is I've sat down and talked with our congressman and and our
[02:46:23.760 --> 02:46:27.680]  senator grant the only give you 15 minutes but hey if you can get 15
[02:46:27.680 --> 02:46:31.160]  minutes in front of a congressman it's it's better exactly when they go out to
[02:46:31.160 --> 02:46:34.680]  these meeting rates when they go around everywhere you tell them how dare you not
[02:46:34.680 --> 02:46:39.120]  repeal this how dare you not take action against it thank you Rick Jerome in
[02:46:39.120 --> 02:46:44.800]  Texas you're on the air yes Alex this is Jerome in Austin Texas and I have a
[02:46:44.800 --> 02:46:50.280]  couple things I want to talk about one thing is Obamacare I'm recently retired
[02:46:50.280 --> 02:46:54.880]  from the motion picture business so I was in entertainment at Universal Studios
[02:46:54.880 --> 02:46:59.520]  for 20 years hey I'm not ignoring you that the police chief just stormed the
[02:46:59.520 --> 02:47:04.440]  office well the SWAT team I'm gonna come back to you hey Austin police chief
[02:47:04.440 --> 02:47:08.840]  Art Acevedo is in here with us right now and he's come to confiscate the guns I
[02:47:08.840 --> 02:47:12.840]  am all for the second amendment every time I have to do you come here I have
[02:47:12.840 --> 02:47:16.800]  to get that out of the way I'm just teasing you anyways how is everything
[02:47:16.800 --> 02:47:21.800]  going good we haven't had any controversy last 24 hours so it's a
[02:47:21.800 --> 02:47:27.560]  it's a good morning so far I ran into a police officer the other day that said
[02:47:27.560 --> 02:47:30.360]  he works at night and he were out at 2 o'clock in the morning doing calls with
[02:47:30.360 --> 02:47:35.000]  him I do that on a regular basis yeah I was a work Saturday night I was supposed
[02:47:35.000 --> 02:47:40.640]  to stay out till about 3 but it was so busy I really didn't get home until 6
[02:47:40.640 --> 02:47:44.520]  in the morning you have made international news you're gonna have to
[02:47:44.520 --> 02:47:48.000]  bring it up with your comment we have a clip of it here you don't have headphones
[02:47:48.000 --> 02:47:51.200]  but you know what you said I actually played this earlier and said really
[02:47:51.200 --> 02:47:54.480]  what you're saying is kind of true you know at least the police here aren't
[02:47:54.480 --> 02:47:58.960]  raping people with toilet plungers are raping women well but there you're
[02:47:58.960 --> 02:48:03.000]  admitting though that in North Korea and Mexico and Nigeria the police are not
[02:48:03.000 --> 02:48:06.840]  too good listen police is imperfect everywhere in the world because the
[02:48:06.840 --> 02:48:10.920]  human condition is imperfect and you know I wish I could go back and take back
[02:48:10.920 --> 02:48:14.880]  that analogy because people that want to hate on the police that want to create
[02:48:14.880 --> 02:48:19.280]  more mistrust of the police have turned that into at least he wasn't rape which
[02:48:19.280 --> 02:48:24.120]  absolutely not was on what was not on my mind that is not what I meant but you
[02:48:24.120 --> 02:48:27.600]  know it is what it is no no in fairness I actually agree with what you said but
[02:48:27.600 --> 02:48:30.760]  see how they took out of context you're saying hey usually it's a controversy of
[02:48:30.760 --> 02:48:36.280]  rape or sorrow corruption I mean at least this is just them you know taking a
[02:48:36.280 --> 02:48:40.520]  woman to jail listen there's a lot of misconceived notions of what happened
[02:48:40.520 --> 02:48:44.320]  there this was a people saw ladies is sitting there screaming on top all all
[02:48:44.320 --> 02:48:49.520]  that video shows is a young lady sitting down screaming using profanities those
[02:48:49.520 --> 02:48:53.000]  that don't know she was jogging and couldn't couldn't hear them saying stop
[02:48:53.000 --> 02:48:58.320]  well well she passed an officer's we don't we weren't there to write tickets
[02:48:58.320 --> 02:49:01.240]  we were there to try to get these young people to make better choices we had
[02:49:01.240 --> 02:49:04.840]  within a couple of hours of that incident we had another young lady or
[02:49:04.840 --> 02:49:08.720]  male don't remember a man or a woman go across the street in front of a bus guy
[02:49:08.720 --> 02:49:12.200]  hit by a bus the next day we had three more people it is true that the bikes and
[02:49:12.200 --> 02:49:16.800]  pedestrians do run out in front of cars all day don't it's it's crazy and so
[02:49:16.800 --> 02:49:22.280]  the bottom line is she did not get arrested for carrying an ID you don't
[02:49:22.280 --> 02:49:26.000]  have to carry an ID in the state of Texas when you're a pedestrian or when
[02:49:26.000 --> 02:49:29.720]  you're riding your bike but if the officers are going to write you a ticket
[02:49:29.720 --> 02:49:33.880]  you have to say who you are so they can write you the ticket you can sign your
[02:49:33.880 --> 02:49:36.800]  promise to appear and you're and you're on your way the answer is like the
[02:49:36.800 --> 02:49:41.200]  running man if we all wore explosive necklaces when she didn't stop they just
[02:49:41.200 --> 02:49:46.520]  blow her head off no we that's no no the NS of the TSA is actually looking at
[02:49:46.520 --> 02:49:51.140]  taser bracelets to fly would you like to put a taser bracelet on yourself no
[02:49:51.140 --> 02:49:54.560]  I'm not I would not sure that I'd be very interested in that at all why not
[02:49:54.560 --> 02:49:58.400]  have explosives at birth planted in the brain so if the government's mad at you
[02:49:58.400 --> 02:50:01.720]  they said a button like snake plus can kind of have you seen escape from New
[02:50:01.720 --> 02:50:05.240]  York easy yeah I love that's one of my favorite movies I love that movie that's
[02:50:05.240 --> 02:50:08.920]  a great movie the original I didn't like to escape from LA no escape from LA
[02:50:08.920 --> 02:50:12.760]  wasn't that good but it's been too long I miss you they talk about yourself a
[02:50:12.760 --> 02:50:18.400]  little bit your dad worked for the CIA in gun running against Fidel Castro my and
[02:50:18.400 --> 02:50:22.360]  now you work to get the guns there in America first of all let me just say
[02:50:22.360 --> 02:50:27.080]  this make it real clear I I will never support a gun control I don't think that
[02:50:27.080 --> 02:50:31.720]  that's the answer for me it's more important to ensure that we do what we
[02:50:31.720 --> 02:50:36.440]  can to keep guns in the hands of law-abiding Americans of saying of
[02:50:36.440 --> 02:50:41.760]  sound mind and it's not about different weapons system it's about making sure we
[02:50:41.760 --> 02:50:45.280]  do our best to keep them in the right hands and that's law-abiding people people

[02:54:30.080 --> 02:54:33.120]  from yeah including you but you know better you know that I'm actually a
[02:54:33.120 --> 02:54:38.720]  pretty moderate guy hey seriously though we have the clip of you talking about
[02:54:38.720 --> 02:54:41.760]  this woman that got arrested for not stopping when she ran across the street
[02:54:41.760 --> 02:54:46.920]  jaywalking jaywalking it said jaywalking is mid block it was for crossing
[02:54:46.920 --> 02:54:51.240]  against the red not not obeying a a traffic control also crossing across a
[02:54:51.240 --> 02:54:57.240]  red okay yeah so so here here is the clip that's gone nationwide from japan
[02:54:57.240 --> 02:55:01.240]  to england of him saying at least our officers aren't raping people here it
[02:55:01.240 --> 02:55:06.720]  is that's not what I said but that's okay taxes that we have a destiny they
[02:55:06.720 --> 02:55:10.600]  touch somebody by the arm and tell them oh my goodness awesome police for trying
[02:55:10.600 --> 02:55:14.800]  to get your attention in other cities cops are actually committing sexual
[02:55:14.800 --> 02:55:20.240]  assaults on duty so I thank God that this is what passes for a controversy in
[02:55:20.240 --> 02:55:24.360]  oxen texan so in other cities they're actually having sexual assaults you're
[02:55:24.360 --> 02:55:29.320]  glad that this passes as a controversy well listen I would never it
[02:55:29.320 --> 02:55:34.160]  breaks my heart in the in the time of instant information anytime a police
[02:55:34.160 --> 02:55:37.520]  officer falls short around the globe because we're all painted with the same
[02:55:37.520 --> 02:55:42.120]  wide brush and it was a bad analogy because I knew I didn't know at the time
[02:55:42.120 --> 02:55:46.960]  but it ended up being twisted but you know Austin lives about points of
[02:55:46.960 --> 02:55:51.520]  reference Austin is such a great city in our department is such a good
[02:55:51.520 --> 02:55:54.480]  department I've been all over the country I have to say the police are nicer in
[02:55:54.480 --> 02:55:58.040]  Austin than almost every other city oh thanks I mean the big cities and small
[02:55:58.040 --> 02:56:01.360]  cities are pretty nice and Alex over the years you've been a soldier for your
[02:56:01.360 --> 02:56:05.320]  for info wars and you've confronted our cops and they've never really put their
[02:56:05.320 --> 02:56:08.920]  hands on you they've always been pretty pretty professional even before I got
[02:56:08.920 --> 02:56:14.080]  here I've seen a lot of the videos and you know it the frustration for me is
[02:56:14.080 --> 02:56:18.960]  this I hold my cops to a very high standard I we our officers here get
[02:56:18.960 --> 02:56:22.280]  fired for things in a lot of departments they don't and then this is the
[02:56:22.280 --> 02:56:26.880]  controversy you cannot you don't get the option of opting out of it as a of a
[02:56:26.880 --> 02:56:31.080]  ticket by refusing to give your name I hear you but here is the controversy and

[02:57:30.800 --> 02:57:33.040]  weeks we got a bunch of cable systems ready to pick it up let me ask you a
[02:57:33.040 --> 02:57:36.440]  serious question I heard you a few months ago on the morning show with sergeant
[02:57:36.440 --> 02:57:40.440]  Sam say quote follow police orders even if you think they're unlawful and you
[02:57:40.440 --> 02:57:45.800]  won't get hurt well I mean if you look at the police officers generally and I
[02:57:45.800 --> 02:57:50.480]  can speak to 20 years of experience generally are responding to the actions
[02:57:50.480 --> 02:57:53.200]  of somebody that's why our use of force policy is called response to the
[02:57:53.200 --> 02:57:58.440]  resistance I tell my kids you don't you don't fight a battle with the cops on
[02:57:58.440 --> 02:58:01.800]  the street if you've been mistreated or you think you want falsely arrested or
[02:58:01.800 --> 02:58:06.120]  the tickets not valid there's a process to do that and so I always tell them is
[02:58:06.120 --> 02:58:11.160]  that we take our grievances through the courts through the police monitor's
[02:58:11.160 --> 02:58:16.080]  office for internal affairs but you just don't do it on the street and you know it
[02:58:16.080 --> 02:58:21.960]  really sadds me when I see folks running from the police you know they get
[02:58:21.960 --> 02:58:26.200]  themselves hurt over over silly violations and in Austin Texas don't
[02:58:26.200 --> 02:58:28.960]  you know might get you a slap on the wrist and you're putting yourself at
[02:58:28.960 --> 02:58:32.440]  risk running it's just it's it's something that has or am I get you shot in
[02:58:32.440 --> 02:58:37.280]  the back well you know I mean nothing good comes from running from the police

[03:02:00.440 --> 03:02:06.720]  nothing that big it says you know we're not worried about those things well you
[03:02:06.720 --> 03:02:10.040]  know this is a short segment long segment coming up so much is going on here
[03:02:10.040 --> 03:02:13.520]  here's my issue I raised from Constitution.org your right to self-defense
[03:02:13.520 --> 03:02:18.120]  against unlawful arrest and then it goes through all the federal and state
[03:02:18.120 --> 03:02:23.440]  rulings about the right to not go along with an unlawful arrest what about these
[03:02:23.440 --> 03:02:27.000]  cases now where the police is coming people's houses without warrants when
[03:02:27.000 --> 03:02:30.080]  there's not like a woman screaming and there's not probable cause when there's
[03:02:30.080 --> 03:02:34.640]  no exigency you mean yeah right well that's illegal you cannot go into a
[03:02:34.640 --> 03:02:39.440]  home without probable cause without a warrant without some exigency and like
[03:02:39.440 --> 03:02:44.120]  and so that's something for a matter for the courts to to resolve if that
[03:02:44.120 --> 03:02:49.120]  happens to somebody. About a month ago the kids were over my parents house we
[03:02:49.120 --> 03:02:51.280]  were swimming in the hot tub in the pool and they were shooting each other with
[03:02:51.280 --> 03:02:53.960]  water guns with cold water around them and there was yelling. Was there
[03:02:53.960 --> 03:02:57.320]  fluoride in that one? I think there was and there was yelling and screaming going
[03:02:57.320 --> 03:03:01.360]  on the neighbors called the police on us and they had my parents gate cut and
[03:03:01.360 --> 03:03:05.040]  came in were real nice and then left but that was it was that was in our city
[03:03:05.040 --> 03:03:08.400]  was that was in Austin it was my parents all you parents but what I'm saying is
[03:03:08.400 --> 03:03:11.440]  that that which scares me is the tattletales that call the police for
[03:03:11.440 --> 03:03:15.960]  no reason. Well you know but the problem is that people you know everybody blames
[03:03:15.960 --> 03:03:19.200]  the police for everything we we're not there and when we get now on one calls
[03:03:19.200 --> 03:03:23.200]  where we we're required to check it out and that's why it's important and
[03:03:23.200 --> 03:03:27.960]  trained vigorously and it's really important for us to have a good
[03:03:27.960 --> 03:03:32.960]  policies good procedures good training and also to have robust what I call
[03:03:32.960 --> 03:03:37.760]  integrity systems you know internal affairs systems because the vast
[03:03:37.760 --> 03:03:41.680]  manager of police officers outstanding upstanding members of the profession but
[03:03:41.680 --> 03:03:45.520]  you know like everybody else we we fall short sometimes and we have to be aware
[03:03:45.520 --> 03:03:50.560]  of that and be vigilant for it. What do you make of the moves in the military to
[03:03:50.560 --> 03:03:59.240]  start replacing humans with robots? You know I you know I I'm kind of a kind of
[03:03:59.240 --> 03:04:04.760]  guy that that quite frankly I don't know what they're gonna do but I worry
[03:04:04.760 --> 03:04:11.120]  about technology will we be able to control the technology if you think
[03:04:11.120 --> 03:04:15.440]  about for a minute when the internet was invented nobody ever thought for a
[03:04:15.440 --> 03:04:21.520]  minute about the bad outcomes the unintended consequences all the crimes
[03:04:21.520 --> 03:04:25.960]  are being they're being committed on the internet from you know the
[03:04:25.960 --> 03:04:31.960]  distributional child pornography to fraud to stealing people's money but just
[03:04:31.960 --> 03:04:35.800]  all the things of the internet has the unintended consequences the unintended
[03:04:35.800 --> 03:04:40.360]  consequences are we're trying to build intelligence an intelligent creature
[03:04:40.360 --> 03:04:45.400]  intelligent machine and the question isn't whether how far we can go the
[03:04:45.400 --> 03:04:50.440]  questions will we be able to control it if we go too far and that's what I worry
[03:04:50.440 --> 03:04:56.200]  about as a member of the human species. Zero on team humanity Art Acevedo the

[03:08:19.520 --> 03:08:27.880]  listening to Alex Jones
[03:08:27.880 --> 03:08:32.040]  all right we've got a final segment with Austin Police Chief Art Acevedo who
[03:08:32.040 --> 03:08:35.120]  got here a little bit late because he's busy with his duties but I if he's got
[03:08:35.120 --> 03:08:37.560]  more time I'd love to do a similar interview for the nightly news yeah we'll
[03:08:37.560 --> 03:08:41.280]  do that on whatever cable get everybody suited up then in 12 minutes over there
[03:08:41.280 --> 03:08:44.960]  to interview him for the nightly news get Jakari Jackson or somebody interviewing
[03:08:44.960 --> 03:08:50.200]  but seriously I've been asking a lot of the questions how about you say some of
[03:08:50.200 --> 03:08:52.720]  the things you think are most important today for the audience out there
[03:08:52.720 --> 03:08:55.920]  nationwide listening well you know one of the things that frustrates me as a
[03:08:55.920 --> 03:09:01.400]  leader in law enforcement a democracy's health starts with a good government
[03:09:01.400 --> 03:09:05.840]  systems in terms of cops doing the right thing for the right reasons and a lot of
[03:09:05.840 --> 03:09:10.400]  folks will tell me six you know seven months ago this happened well doesn't do
[03:09:10.400 --> 03:09:14.360]  us any good if you don't have the details if if we fall short we'd like to
[03:09:14.360 --> 03:09:18.520]  know about it we'd like to know the facts and the sooner the better so we can
[03:09:18.520 --> 03:09:23.120]  correct behavior you cannot correct behavior that you're not made aware of
[03:09:23.120 --> 03:09:27.640]  one and two when crimes occur please report it there's some folks that don't
[03:09:27.640 --> 03:09:30.200]  even they don't want to trust the police don't even bother each reporting crimes
[03:09:30.200 --> 03:09:34.640]  and you know we can't go out through the bad guys if we don't know the crime
[03:09:34.640 --> 03:09:38.980]  occurred in the first place so you know I believe in engagement that's why from
[03:09:38.980 --> 03:09:43.480]  day one I've been coming here to to engage you and your and the community you
[03:09:43.480 --> 03:09:48.240]  serve and quite frankly as you know we we sometimes have more in common in
[03:09:48.240 --> 03:09:52.160]  terms of what our thoughts are than we don't but we want to be part of the
[03:09:52.160 --> 03:09:55.440]  solution not part of the problem the only we can do that is through mutual
[03:09:55.440 --> 03:10:00.320]  respect and through engagement and through brutal honesty what about the
[03:10:00.320 --> 03:10:03.680]  federalization of police because we all know that's going on the federal
[03:10:03.680 --> 03:10:08.200]  funding the threat fusion centers the NSA what's your view on the federal
[03:10:08.200 --> 03:10:14.800]  government is it out of control on with the NSA well you know I don't know if
[03:10:14.800 --> 03:10:19.000]  they're out of control I think that because of what happened with the the
[03:10:19.000 --> 03:10:25.040]  the young man that's now in Russia Snowden yes mr. Snowden that some
[03:10:25.040 --> 03:10:30.040]  changes have been made but but I can tell you this that the partners that we
[03:10:30.040 --> 03:10:36.680]  work with they are very respectful of the Constitution they know that in the
[03:10:36.680 --> 03:10:40.000]  awesome police department we are committed to constitutional policing and
[03:10:40.000 --> 03:10:44.320]  we are committed to the respect the rights of the citizens that we serve
[03:10:44.320 --> 03:10:47.920]  because our power really does come from the people that we so you guys do data
[03:10:47.920 --> 03:10:52.280]  mind what's open source which is legal and lawful can you repeat to me what you
[03:10:52.280 --> 03:10:55.640]  said earlier out there how you're concerned for me you know if any if you
[03:10:55.640 --> 03:11:01.520]  get any threat we would we we may pick up on that and because you were saying you
[03:11:01.520 --> 03:11:05.360]  guys see the threats I get there's some associations out there and so you kind
[03:11:05.360 --> 03:11:09.560]  of worry about you know threats against members of your community and against
[03:11:09.560 --> 03:11:14.240]  institutions in your community and so what people don't understand is speed
[03:11:14.240 --> 03:11:17.000]  but really you got because I'm aware of the threats but you guys you you're
[03:11:17.000 --> 03:11:20.560]  actually aware of all the death threats I get if they I mean the public ones we
[03:11:20.560 --> 03:11:24.200]  do become aware of some of them and we make sure that there's nothing to it
[03:11:24.200 --> 03:11:28.440]  because you know the bottom line is this we all have a First Amendment right but
[03:11:28.440 --> 03:11:31.560]  we don't have the right to make terrorist threats heuristic threats to
[03:11:31.560 --> 03:11:34.520]  people to say you're gonna kill them that you're gonna blow them up one time I
[03:11:34.520 --> 03:11:39.200]  got a call from from the feds actually saying about six years ago that
[03:11:39.200 --> 03:11:42.840]  somebody was coming to shoot me at an event and sure enough the guy showed up
[03:11:42.840 --> 03:11:46.200]  and sure enough they drug him out and he had a bunch of guns in his car and was
[03:11:46.200 --> 03:11:50.840]  planning but they never got in trouble though well I let me just say this that
[03:11:50.840 --> 03:11:55.120]  we we we we are not interested in your political ideology we're not interested
[03:11:55.120 --> 03:12:01.320]  in your beliefs but when you start making threats to harm somebody to kill
[03:12:01.320 --> 03:12:06.160]  somebody to commit a which clearly a crime we will always take that serious
[03:12:06.160 --> 03:12:09.200]  thing we will always well that's illegal isn't it a call to action for
[03:12:09.200 --> 03:12:14.800]  violence well if you're threatening to commit a crime absolutely it can be a
[03:12:14.800 --> 03:12:19.160]  problem yeah because if you say I'm so mad at Bob I could kill him but then
[03:12:19.160 --> 03:12:23.440]  you're not serious right but if you start making plans to kill Bob are you
[03:12:23.440 --> 03:12:27.240]  gonna say you know what I hate Bob he's a piece of work and I'm gonna go kill him
[03:12:27.240 --> 03:12:31.720]  that is a little that's not protected speech because it doesn't mean that you
[03:12:31.720 --> 03:12:36.360]  can't say it but it may result in an investigation I have the article here
[03:12:36.360 --> 03:12:40.040]  out of the current police officer charged with sexually assaulting police
[03:12:40.040 --> 03:12:44.680]  explorer I guess might want to ride along a 17 year old cadet is that the
[03:12:44.680 --> 03:12:47.080]  kind of cases you're talking about that you're glad Austin doesn't have you
[03:12:47.080 --> 03:12:51.120]  know again you know that analogy probably shouldn't have used it but but the
[03:12:51.120 --> 03:12:56.880]  frustration for me is that sometimes what passes for controversy in Austin
[03:12:56.880 --> 03:13:01.000]  all we simply did was a woman ran past the cop who's standing there going hey
[03:13:01.000 --> 03:13:06.280]  stop police ran at him and passed him and yelled stop the other officer is
[03:13:06.280 --> 03:13:10.680]  sees it runs after her is yelling police is right by her's looking at her stop
[03:13:10.680 --> 03:13:15.040]  police finally grabs her arm when she takes off her earbuds I don't give an F
[03:13:15.040 --> 03:13:18.640]  who you are get your hands off of me and then she looks like she's gonna run
[03:13:18.640 --> 03:13:22.600]  again make a long story short refuse to say her name all they want to do is write
[03:13:22.600 --> 03:13:26.720]  a ticket or a warning and move on with our day and just lost it we cannot let
[03:13:26.720 --> 03:13:30.800]  you don't get the opt out of a ticket but I think the police are getting the
[03:13:30.800 --> 03:13:35.640]  blowback of the overall anger at the system and the political corruption at
[03:13:35.640 --> 03:13:38.800]  the top you know what's really interesting is that when you look at the
[03:13:38.800 --> 03:13:42.240]  tweets and everything else and then you follow you know I've gotten some threats
[03:13:42.240 --> 03:13:46.320]  myself because of this incident where people even have the facts only all they
[03:13:46.320 --> 03:13:49.720]  have is a video of a young lady sitting down on a sidewalk screaming and
[03:13:49.720 --> 03:13:52.800]  somehow it's all the police's fault they didn't have they have no idea of how
[03:13:52.800 --> 03:13:57.000]  we got to that point and so the threats that we've been getting and the anger
[03:13:57.000 --> 03:13:59.760]  you see and you see who these people are they're angry at the government they
[03:13:59.760 --> 03:14:03.680]  angry at everything else but what I tell my officers is that we are operating at
[03:14:03.680 --> 03:14:07.520]  a time when mistrust of government is a historical high so you have to be
[03:14:07.520 --> 03:14:12.400]  aware of that and you have to be really good really fair and make sure that
[03:14:12.400 --> 03:14:17.320]  you're policing in the constitutionally lawful manner because it's a very angry
[03:14:17.320 --> 03:14:21.360]  backdrop right now well that's why we are now deprogramming you and your love
[03:14:21.360 --> 03:14:25.040]  affair with mayor Bloomberg and mayors against gun violence I am giving you a
[03:14:25.040 --> 03:14:31.400]  extra large Molan lobby info wars Spartan shirt and tell me police if this

[03:15:16.120 --> 03:15:19.920]  here you don't have to agree to disagree and I think one of the things that we
[03:15:19.920 --> 03:15:23.960]  need to work on it as a as a society is that sometimes people may have the right
[03:15:23.960 --> 03:15:28.040]  they may be right on an issue but because they're screaming about the issue
[03:15:28.040 --> 03:15:32.960]  the way that they're expressing themselves ends up the people just hear
[03:15:32.960 --> 03:15:38.320]  noise instead of well sure I mean I never came at this with some plan and I
[03:15:38.320 --> 03:15:41.520]  did you see yelling scream a lot more than I do now and I have noticed it's
[03:15:41.520 --> 03:15:44.560]  actually more effective to be calm yeah with information a lot of the time
[03:15:44.560 --> 03:15:48.720]  yeah people actually I still remember your parents with what's the amount I

[03:16:02.200 --> 03:16:07.720]  leave it at that and it was fun to watch because I because I don't think

[03:16:32.160 --> 03:16:37.440]  for a while really no criminal record variant David Jones a very David Jones
[03:16:37.440 --> 03:16:41.160]  a very common name yeah I actually know an Alex Jones it's not you there's a lot
[03:16:41.160 --> 03:16:46.920]  of Alex Joneses yeah yeah absolutely who's a number number two guy and the
[03:16:46.920 --> 03:16:50.400]  California Art Patrol for a long time oh really yeah yeah they'll probably say
[03:16:50.400 --> 03:16:53.640]  I'm secretly him now yeah he's shorter than you are no you're everybody knows
[03:16:53.640 --> 03:16:59.280]  that you're part of the CIA so everybody knows your dad really was though hey my
[03:16:59.280 --> 03:17:02.880]  dad that's why when you call me communist and people that know nothing
[03:17:02.880 --> 03:17:07.360]  about me call me a communist I'm sorry I was saying if you want if you don't want
[03:17:07.360 --> 03:17:11.280]  the guns around then that would be like supporting for now you should go to Cuba
[03:17:11.280 --> 03:17:15.600]  you know what if why would I want why would I not want to have a process in
[03:17:15.600 --> 03:17:20.760]  place to try to keep guns out of the hands of criminals felons drug dealers
[03:17:20.760 --> 03:17:24.160]  why gangbangers because they're only going to use that process against law
[03:17:24.160 --> 03:17:27.680]  abiding people you know what look at Connecticut they are now confiscating all
[03:17:27.680 --> 03:17:31.760]  the guns in Connecticut I don't pay attention I'm talking about Texas
[03:17:31.760 --> 03:17:36.560]  Texans are very responsible gun owners are concealed handgun licensees my
[03:17:36.560 --> 03:17:40.520]  uncles 80s 80 something years old he still can goes and qualifies all the
[03:17:40.520 --> 03:17:45.360]  time I think we do it right in Texas but you protect the Second Amendment by
[03:17:45.360 --> 03:17:51.280]  doing what we can to ensure that the that prohibited gun owners and gun buyers
[03:17:51.280 --> 03:17:56.760]  are are we keep the guns I see I believe that you genuinely see the good side of
[03:17:56.760 --> 03:18:01.880]  that yeah your bottom line bottom line Bloomberg and others want the abolition
[03:18:01.880 --> 03:18:06.880]  of civilian ownership of firearms that's what the UN wants Mike Martinez did
[03:18:06.880 --> 03:18:09.680]  say hey we're going to register him now and you'll need that sign later we're
[03:18:09.680 --> 03:18:13.000]  going to confiscate them later there is an anti-gun attitude out there well
[03:18:13.000 --> 03:18:17.160]  that being there there may be but I can tell you that the majority of American
[03:18:17.160 --> 03:18:20.720]  law enforcement we are not in no I know that I know that out of the hands of
[03:18:20.720 --> 03:18:26.680]  of America of American citizens but but but I am interested in ensuring that one
[03:18:26.680 --> 03:18:29.880]  of the things that you might want to support like they did in the state of
[03:18:29.880 --> 03:18:37.080]  California is mandatory sentencing when you commit a crime and you use a gun
[03:18:37.080 --> 03:18:42.000]  or if you use a gun and a commission of a felony you must do 10 years in prison
[03:18:42.000 --> 03:18:47.200]  if you shoot somebody you have a minimum of 20 years in prison that really when
[03:18:47.200 --> 03:18:51.800]  those mandatory sentences passed in California in terms of the use of firearms
[03:18:51.800 --> 03:18:55.960]  and crimes it really had an impact on violent crime so but I mean violent
[03:18:55.960 --> 03:19:00.280]  crime with guns has dropped 51% the Justice Department's own numbers since 1992
[03:19:00.280 --> 03:19:04.320]  but believe quit blaming guns overall more guns means less crime I'm not
[03:19:04.320 --> 03:19:06.920]  worried as more guns being less crime no I'm more I'm not worried about you say
[03:19:06.920 --> 03:19:10.200]  more on lobby I'm not worried about guns I'm worried about guns in the wrong
[03:19:10.200 --> 03:19:14.200]  hands and and the more that we can the more we do continue to reduce that of
[03:19:14.200 --> 03:19:18.520]  gun violence the better position will be to protect us what about my walk can
[03:19:18.520 --> 03:19:22.640]  you say wall on lobby no that's that's I don't even know what that means it
