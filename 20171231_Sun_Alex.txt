[00:00:10.968 --> 00:00:19.694]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:00:19.694 --> 00:00:20.275]  I'm not kidding.
[00:00:21.667 --> 00:00:28.373]  This is the most excited I've been since the inauguration almost a year ago when I was in DC.
[00:00:28.373 --> 00:00:32.736]  The energy in the air, the developments, the things that are happening.
[00:00:32.736 --> 00:00:35.558]  It is an incredible time to be here tonight.
[00:00:35.558 --> 00:00:40.382]  The final transmission of InfoWars in 2017 as we plunge forward into 2018.
[00:00:48.169 --> 00:00:50.831]  2017 was a major year of revolution against globalists around the world.
[00:00:50.831 --> 00:01:05.582]  It was a major year of incredible betrayals we learned about from the megabanks and the big cartels, but also an incredible year of delivery by populist and nationalist movements across the world.
[00:01:05.582 --> 00:01:06.543]  Truly amazing.
[00:01:07.702 --> 00:01:17.191]  I hope the 2017 doesn't go out with a bang, but if you look at DrudgeReport.com, Houston hotel arsenal bust above New Year's Eve celebration.
[00:01:17.191 --> 00:01:18.913]  New Year's Eve celebration.
[00:01:18.913 --> 00:01:23.417]  Caught him drunk, stumbling around with a bunch of weapons and ammo.
[00:01:23.417 --> 00:01:27.902]  Hopefully that's just some crazy person, they weren't actually planning something.
[00:01:27.902 --> 00:01:28.742]  Trump promises
[00:01:29.853 --> 00:01:42.857]  In 2018, to do much, much more on regulations, on other taxes, on going after the welfare queens that have been domesticated by the globalists, we're going to look at what's coming up in the year ahead.
[00:01:42.857 --> 00:01:51.399]  But first off, ladies and gentlemen, there's a lot of other exciting news on Infowars.com that we're going to be going over.
[00:01:51.399 --> 00:01:58.061]  And we're going to be looking at the amazing developments with The Nation and The New York Times.
[00:02:00.771 --> 00:02:04.294]  Even CNN coming out with headlines like this little jewel.
[00:02:04.294 --> 00:02:09.618]  See, I'm so excited I can't even hardly hold a piece of paper in my hands.
[00:02:09.618 --> 00:02:10.999]  Seriously, I can feel the energy.
[00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:12.100]  Can't you?
[00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:13.501]  2018's gonna be a doozy.
[00:02:13.501 --> 00:02:15.823]  You think 2016 was big, 2017?
[00:02:15.823 --> 00:02:21.988]  It just goes forward in the human singularity with technology, human populations, the good, the bad, the ugly.
[00:02:21.988 --> 00:02:25.610]  I mean, we are tied to a rocket ship, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:29.093]  We're either going to Valhalla or we're going on an express elevator to hell.
[00:02:29.093 --> 00:02:29.654]  So get ready.
[00:02:30.717 --> 00:02:32.398]  I can feel the energy, wow.
[00:02:32.398 --> 00:02:36.421]  And it's good energy overall.
[00:02:36.421 --> 00:02:43.666]  There's a little dark energy twisted over there on the dark side of the moon, but other than that, this is an amazing time right now.
[00:02:43.666 --> 00:02:47.028]  Trump is right about the FBI.
[00:02:47.028 --> 00:02:50.931]  That's the headline out of CNN.
[00:02:50.931 --> 00:02:58.336]  They say the FBI is a political operation at the top, run by the Clintons, engaging in a major frame-up of Trump, that it's all a giant fraud.
[00:02:59.475 --> 00:03:04.998]  And that it's destroying the FBI and governmental institutions and turbocharging Trump.
[00:03:04.998 --> 00:03:14.723]  The only reason they're saying drop the Russia investigation now is because it blew up in their face, as we told you months ago it had already done, and now it's even evident to them.
[00:03:14.723 --> 00:03:23.207]  They tried to paper over it, tried to not cover it on CNN, MSNBC, didn't work, so now they are crapping their globalist pedophile britches.
[00:03:24.708 --> 00:03:30.656]  Here it is, out of the nation, the so-called pinnacle of liberal socialist pinhead thinking.
[00:03:31.713 --> 00:03:36.216]  Russiagate is devolving into an effort to stigmatize dissent.
[00:03:36.216 --> 00:03:49.907]  No, it was always an effort to stigmatize nationalist and free market dissent and attempt to overturn the election, overturn all the other major elections of 2016 and bring in globalist federalized control after Trump was removed to never have another free election.
[00:03:49.907 --> 00:03:57.913]  You failed at your effort to stigmatize dissent, so now you're taking the high horse road
[00:03:59.912 --> 00:04:01.853]  Because you've been caught.
[00:04:01.853 --> 00:04:03.554]  But again, it's everywhere.
[00:04:03.554 --> 00:04:05.135]  It's beyond blood in the water.
[00:04:05.135 --> 00:04:24.247]  It's shark's dining on the leftist lemmings and the controlled corporate press that took itself from dead to undead with all the globalist funding the last few years to now simply disappearing in a puff of ashes into the atmosphere.
[00:04:27.546 --> 00:04:35.729]  And it's fitting to cap all that off that we now learn about one of the major Nigerian print scammers.
[00:04:35.729 --> 00:04:39.350]  Turns out he's a white guy from Louisiana.
[00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:41.370]  But isn't that kind of a parable?
[00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:43.611]  It's a known 20-year fraud.
[00:04:43.611 --> 00:04:48.913]  Billions have been stolen by it, but they still keep using the fraud because people still keep buying it.
[00:04:48.913 --> 00:04:54.054]  Just like they keep voting for Obamacare or globalism or communism, even though it's known nightmares.
[00:04:54.054 --> 00:04:55.015]  We'll be back!
[00:04:55.015 --> 00:04:55.555]  Stay with us!
[00:04:59.881 --> 00:05:00.662]  I'm so excited.
[00:05:00.662 --> 00:05:10.828]  The new product, Infowarslife.com, in a glass bottle, two-month servings, filled to the brim, filled to the absolute top, the real red pill.
[00:05:10.828 --> 00:05:16.332]  This is a heart and brain pill, a nootropic that doesn't have any stimulants in it.
[00:05:16.332 --> 00:05:19.334]  But boy, does it stimulate, because it's beyond that.
[00:05:19.334 --> 00:05:28.120]  Quite frankly, I just went off what I saw medical doctors prescribing to their patients, but it wasn't prescription, but they were charging people $100, $200.
[00:05:30.199 --> 00:05:49.788]  For the formulae, and I came up with our own formula, working with some scientists and developers, non-GMO, made right here in America, 120 capsules, and ladies and gentlemen, you add the preglanone to it, which is the precursor to all the hormones that your body has to have to even make the hormones in your glands.
[00:05:49.788 --> 00:05:52.469]  It is amazing!
[00:05:52.469 --> 00:05:57.431]  Red Pill, now available at InfoWarsStore.com, and your purchase fugs the operation.
[00:06:00.165 --> 00:06:02.446]  We've got it.
[00:06:02.446 --> 00:06:07.248]  The Christmas is coming to you.
[00:06:07.248 --> 00:06:11.630]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:06:11.630 --> 00:06:20.373]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the Infowar.
[00:06:20.373 --> 00:06:24.055]  It has been a spectacular year.
[00:06:27.005 --> 00:06:47.871]  2017, there's like a 110 year old man standing up on the precipice of the cliff with his beard so long and his teeth so long that he's about to jump off that cliff and turn to dust before he even begins to fall.
[00:06:52.162 --> 00:06:57.105]  Be part of the foundation of 2018.
[00:06:57.105 --> 00:07:04.069]  As like a bright-eyed child, it comes toddling out into the future.
[00:07:04.069 --> 00:07:06.450]  What an amazing time to be alive.
[00:07:06.450 --> 00:07:10.753]  A time of true renewal.
[00:07:10.753 --> 00:07:18.777]  Yes, we face amazing challenges, but Trump knows for every yin, there's a yang.
[00:07:18.777 --> 00:07:19.198]  And that
[00:07:21.038 --> 00:07:27.122]  Parasitic behavior, globalism, a program of making people poor to control them, feudalism.
[00:07:27.122 --> 00:07:33.006]  That'd been done for the entire history of recorded human annals.
[00:07:33.006 --> 00:07:36.488]  But Renaissance was only 460-something years old.
[00:07:36.488 --> 00:07:39.470]  Our Republic, only 244 years old.
[00:07:39.470 --> 00:07:47.075]  The idea of empowering humanity, turning loose the lower classes, and then finding the great genius that lied therein.
[00:07:48.882 --> 00:08:11.550]  There's no doubt that even limited free market capitalism, we've never achieved full capitalism, produces such innovation, such choice, such wealth, such dynamics, that compared to communism, it's like comparing a dumb inanimate rock to the mind of God.
[00:08:11.550 --> 00:08:13.530]  But that is the mind of God.
[00:08:13.530 --> 00:08:15.151]  Free will, choice, but
[00:08:16.158 --> 00:08:25.445]  With that comes great responsibility, because if you're given so much power, will you become a narcissistic Luciferian?
[00:08:25.445 --> 00:08:30.349]  Will you decide to keep others from the Promethean fire, which you have been given?
[00:08:30.349 --> 00:08:34.472]  Will you attempt to hoard the light to yourself?
[00:08:34.472 --> 00:08:40.857]  Falling in love, like Narcissus with his own reflection.
[00:08:40.857 --> 00:08:42.658]  That way lies ruin.
[00:08:46.647 --> 00:09:00.877]  For those of us that seek the dark tower, the quest to be honorable, strong men and build up society and civilization, this is a very, very special time to be alive, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:09:00.877 --> 00:09:09.763]  But it is like taking breath, taking a cup of wine before the real fight.
[00:09:09.763 --> 00:09:11.805]  It is the breath before we're sucked under.
[00:09:13.769 --> 00:09:31.841]  So take a deep breath and get ready because the final challenge in the next 35-40 years on whether we will survive as a species or whether we will destroy ourselves in satanic delusions is now before us.
[00:09:31.841 --> 00:09:36.284]  We are at the crossroads.
[00:09:36.284 --> 00:09:42.228]  And my great sin, Donald Trump's great sin, many of yours great sin according to the
[00:09:43.072 --> 00:09:54.436]  Globalist, pedophile, devil worshippers, the selfish ones, is that we believe in humanity and are confident and want to build others up.
[00:09:54.436 --> 00:10:06.241]  And so they play us, knowing we have a conscience, knowing we care to give up our own will and wealth to supposedly help the individual who is poor, but it's really only through another combine to set them up as the master.
[00:10:08.117 --> 00:10:27.632]  But Trump knows that if he can turn America and the world around, at least financially, and get us back to basic tenets we know are designed to work and do work, versus collectivism, communism, and all the dehumanization and mass murder that follows it.
[00:10:27.632 --> 00:10:33.997]  If he can simply do that, when they talk about Camelot and the Kennedys,
[00:10:36.052 --> 00:10:40.715]  Who are seriously silver spoon wannabe elitist.
[00:10:40.715 --> 00:10:44.638]  I mean, I don't want to say bad people overall, but give me a break.
[00:10:44.638 --> 00:10:49.341]  That was just TV getting fancy and media learning how to doll people up.
[00:10:49.341 --> 00:10:53.403]  And so it was like a tabloid presidency.
[00:10:53.403 --> 00:11:03.910]  With Trump, he's got the supermodel, goddess, beyond feminine, powerful, flamethrowing female.
[00:11:05.643 --> 00:11:07.324]  The real energy, the real power.
[00:11:07.324 --> 00:11:12.087]  Now the most popular person in America, according to Gallup, everything is imploding in their face.
[00:11:12.087 --> 00:11:25.637]  He's got that, but what he's really delivering is the belief in the worker, the belief in the family, the belief in the individual, and a chance to help you get the chip off your shoulder and move forward.
[00:11:25.637 --> 00:11:30.320]  And that infuriates the vampires, the spiritually
[00:11:31.738 --> 00:11:42.725]  Hunchback devils who absolutely hate your will, hate your strength, hate your honor, and hate your goodwill.
[00:11:42.725 --> 00:11:58.554]  And they ravenously want to pull you down and want to destroy you and want to annihilate you because your very existence, your good heart, your love of God, is like nails on a chalkboard to them spiritually.
[00:11:59.744 --> 00:12:04.125]  And the only consciousness they have is to destroy you.
[00:12:04.125 --> 00:12:13.387]  The only will they have is to annihilate you.
[00:12:13.387 --> 00:12:24.949]  The world is in a rotting, corrupt, twisted, betrayed, withering depression right now.
[00:12:24.949 --> 00:12:25.329]  And so,
[00:12:26.539 --> 00:12:37.608]  As grandiose and quite frankly grotesque at times Trump is, like the ghost of Christmas present, it's what we need.
[00:12:37.608 --> 00:12:54.922]  And it's the thing, the perfect thing to challenge the austerity and the poverty and the bondage and the backstabbing and the twistedness and the failure that is globalism and communism and collectivism and all of its systems of centralization.
[00:12:56.997 --> 00:13:07.622]  And Trump knows that if he delivers, the Trump dynasty will be unmatched.
[00:13:07.622 --> 00:13:11.804]  The problem is, the sons are good, the daughters aren't bad.
[00:13:11.804 --> 00:13:14.946]  They're women, and they want to conform in their culture.
[00:13:15.626 --> 00:13:24.590]  They're from New York, and they continue to try to virtue signal, and I'm sure that Trump's daughter could end up, you know, being President Ivanka someday.
[00:13:24.590 --> 00:13:29.693]  She's beautiful, she's smart, but she's a compromiser.
[00:13:29.693 --> 00:13:37.996]  And as I go off another side issue, I can just see into the future as anybody else could see, not with magical powers, but with the powers of deduction God gave us.
[00:13:37.996 --> 00:13:45.300]  And I can tell you now undoubtedly that it's the same spirit that Trump has that I have in that
[00:13:48.169 --> 00:13:59.281]  I am so confident, not in an arrogant way, but that I couldn't lie to somebody or try to hold them down so I would feel powerful over them.
[00:13:59.281 --> 00:14:03.586]  And it's that simple spirit that separates us from the devil worshippers.
[00:14:03.586 --> 00:14:05.868]  That's who they are.
[00:14:05.868 --> 00:14:07.090]  It's all about them.
[00:14:07.090 --> 00:14:07.991]  Total selfishness.
[00:14:09.414 --> 00:14:11.175]  Well, we're going to make it all about us.
[00:14:11.175 --> 00:14:12.995]  You want to dominate, destroy us?
[00:14:12.995 --> 00:14:16.396]  It is about us, all of us together, not you.
[00:14:16.396 --> 00:14:20.358]  And it's about you getting out of the way and getting behind us, Satan.
[00:14:20.358 --> 00:14:28.021]  And it really does come down to those union archetypes.
[00:14:28.021 --> 00:14:28.881]  But that's where we are.
[00:14:30.296 --> 00:14:32.498]  And, I mean, I knew globalism was real.
[00:14:32.498 --> 00:14:33.900]  I knew their World Government Plan was real.
[00:14:33.900 --> 00:14:39.626]  I was reading the white papers, seeing it happen, reading stuff they wrote 50 years ago and seeing it, you know, come true in the early 90s.
[00:14:39.626 --> 00:14:51.799]  And, I mean, with exact programming, and reading the CFR publications every two months when it came out, and then telling people and having news articles written about me saying, this man's a liar, he's dangerous.
[00:14:55.031 --> 00:15:04.760]  And then having news reporters go, listen, we're mercenaries, we really agree with you, keep it up, with tears in their eyes.
[00:15:04.760 --> 00:15:08.843]  Democrat politicians coming over to me and going, listen, son, we like what you're doing.
[00:15:08.843 --> 00:15:13.868]  A lot of us made wrong choices and are slaves now, but I hope you're successful.
[00:15:13.868 --> 00:15:17.091]  And the Republican blue blood trash, they're the worst.
[00:15:17.091 --> 00:15:18.252]  The point is, is that
[00:15:19.619 --> 00:15:31.085]  Just as Americana was born, as Alexander de Tocqueville, the historian, wrote about, about not liking royalty, not liking class, just because somebody was from an upper class, you didn't worship them, even though they were a moronic, you know, inbred idiot.
[00:15:31.085 --> 00:15:33.186]  It was about what you actually did.
[00:15:33.186 --> 00:15:35.787]  And that's coming back into the world.
[00:15:35.787 --> 00:15:38.249]  It's not just Americana, it's human and it's beautiful.
[00:15:38.849 --> 00:15:40.210]  CNN has come out.
[00:15:40.210 --> 00:15:46.132]  The Nation, you name it, admitted that Russiagate is a total fraud and needs to be stopped because it's hurting them now.
[00:15:46.132 --> 00:15:47.832]  That's coming up on the other side.
[00:15:47.832 --> 00:15:53.415]  Economic Outlooks, so much more, and a bunch of exclusive breaking news.
[00:15:53.415 --> 00:15:53.975]  Stay with us.
[00:15:53.975 --> 00:15:54.395]  We'll be back.
[00:15:58.479 --> 00:16:04.362]  2017 has been a earth-shaking year.

[00:16:07.524 --> 00:16:12.327]  In fact, my good friend, Stefan Molyneux, said it's gonna be like the Battle of the Gods, Ragnarok.
[00:16:12.327 --> 00:16:14.348]  So get ready, ladies and gentlemen.

[00:18:27.824 --> 00:18:28.044]  Woo!

[00:18:29.065 --> 00:18:37.808]  And when compared to traditional methods of preservation, like canning or dehydrating, you know, like what you get at the grocery store, there is no comparison.
[00:18:37.808 --> 00:18:45.911]  Harvest Right freeze dryers retain 97% of the food's taste, color, and nutritional value, and have a shelf life of up to 25 years.
[00:18:47.392 --> 00:18:50.835]  Now that's what I call the miracle of food preservation.

[00:19:51.112 --> 00:19:52.633]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:20.148 --> 00:20:22.854]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:20:22.854 --> 00:20:27.884]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWars.
[00:20:29.326 --> 00:20:33.287]  Now I know, as an audience, you know Russiagate is fake.
[00:20:33.287 --> 00:20:37.087]  And that it was the Clintons did it and the Podestas did it because they were up their eyeballs with Russian collusion.
[00:20:37.087 --> 00:20:38.348]  And they were scared.
[00:20:38.348 --> 00:20:43.509]  And so was the FBI director, the former director, McCabe, Rosenstein.
[00:20:43.509 --> 00:20:45.409]  I mean, they're all involved with the Russians.
[00:20:45.409 --> 00:20:47.029]  They're all involved with the companies.
[00:20:47.029 --> 00:20:48.370]  They're involved killing investigations.
[00:20:48.370 --> 00:20:49.750]  They're involved getting money.
[00:20:49.750 --> 00:20:50.850]  They sold out our uranium.
[00:20:50.850 --> 00:20:51.770]  I mean, they're globalists.
[00:20:51.770 --> 00:20:53.271]  They're not Russian agents.
[00:20:53.271 --> 00:20:55.371]  They sell out to anybody that wants to gang-rape America.
[00:20:56.550 --> 00:21:00.853]  And so Trump comes in and says, we're gonna have 38.9% taxes and China has 15.
[00:21:00.853 --> 00:21:05.035]  We're gonna have 15.
[00:21:05.035 --> 00:21:09.038]  And so China, by the way, lowered his taxes to zero to counter America.
[00:21:09.038 --> 00:21:10.799]  See how that works, folks?
[00:21:10.799 --> 00:21:11.379]  See how that works?
[00:21:11.379 --> 00:21:14.481]  But that's coming up, sorry.
[00:21:14.481 --> 00:21:22.166]  But the reason it's important is the etymology, the historical genetic history of this compendium, of this story.
[00:21:24.824 --> 00:21:28.105]  Because remember, I have been called a Russian agent.
[00:21:28.105 --> 00:21:32.166]  They have congressional hearings in the Senate and the House, armed services, intelligence committees.
[00:21:32.166 --> 00:21:34.686]  We've played the clips here ad nauseam.
[00:21:34.686 --> 00:21:37.387]  If you're a new listener, I know this sounds crazy, but I'm not going to play them again.
[00:21:37.387 --> 00:21:38.327]  You can look them up.
[00:21:38.327 --> 00:21:40.187]  They're on Infowars.com.
[00:21:40.187 --> 00:21:44.108]  And they admit in the hearings that they have no evidence I'm a Russian agent.
[00:21:44.108 --> 00:21:48.369]  Then they say, but he is one, so we're censoring Alex Jones.
[00:21:54.534 --> 00:21:56.195]  They're using this to kill dissent.
[00:21:56.195 --> 00:22:03.217]  And finally, CNN, The New York Times, I mean, I've got a stack of news, I'm going to go over here in a minute.
[00:22:03.217 --> 00:22:10.799]  Mainstream News, today, coming out saying Russiagate is devolving into an effort to stigmatize dissent.
[00:22:10.799 --> 00:22:12.420]  It didn't devolve.
[00:22:12.420 --> 00:22:15.981]  Hitler didn't devolve into a Nazi in 1945.
[00:22:15.981 --> 00:22:17.121]  He was a Nazi.
[00:22:17.121 --> 00:22:22.103]  Gonorrhea doesn't devolve into gonorrhea.
[00:22:22.103 --> 00:22:22.383]  Okay?
[00:22:24.841 --> 00:22:29.204]  But why are they all coming out this weekend and in the last week?
[00:22:29.204 --> 00:22:34.587]  Why are they all coming out suddenly saying, okay, it's a total fraud, it's authoritarian, it's all a lie?
[00:22:34.587 --> 00:22:37.788]  Because they got caught and it blew up in their face.
[00:22:37.788 --> 00:22:47.034]  I mean, I'm not going to go over it again, but there are 26 Justice Department and FBI people that are senior and five or six others we found, but they're mid-level
[00:22:48.138 --> 00:22:48.858]  I don't know.
[00:23:13.570 --> 00:23:15.292]  It's not just that.
[00:23:15.292 --> 00:23:25.502]  The real crime is the millions of taxpayer dollars from the FBI and Justice Department to the lives and husbands of people at Fusion GPS that made it up.
[00:23:25.502 --> 00:23:30.486]  I mean, it was like a 40-something page report that a 10-year-old could have written.
[00:23:30.486 --> 00:23:34.450]  It's so badly written, it looks like it was written in finger paints or something.
[00:23:34.450 --> 00:23:35.912]  But they got millions of dollars to write it.
[00:23:37.873 --> 00:23:41.555]  So, this has blown up so bad, so crazily.
[00:23:41.555 --> 00:23:47.619]  These arrogant people thought they were invincible because the power went to their heads.
[00:23:47.619 --> 00:23:55.363]  And so now, the New York Times, CNN, The Nation, they're not coming out in the last couple days.
[00:23:55.363 --> 00:24:00.767]  This all started after Christmas, last five days, since the 26th.
[00:24:00.767 --> 00:24:04.589]  They didn't start coming out and doing this because they really are suddenly good people.
[00:24:06.735 --> 00:24:09.136]  They've been some of the biggest floggers of this.
[00:24:09.136 --> 00:24:19.121]  They're letting people now come right to truth, some of them are good people by the way, but bad publications, because they know it's over.
[00:24:19.121 --> 00:24:22.503]  So let me just announce to you right now.
[00:24:22.503 --> 00:24:30.967]  Russiagate blew up in their face about a month ago, as we first told you, and as I've said, it's over, it's done, but they're going to try to paper over it and keep the con game going.
[00:24:30.967 --> 00:24:31.508]  It didn't work.
[00:24:32.532 --> 00:24:37.895]  And now, they have committed so many crimes, leaking disinfo, not just leaking.
[00:24:37.895 --> 00:24:41.516]  They have been caught with the Russians, with the Communist Chinese, with everything.
[00:24:41.516 --> 00:24:46.199]  They are crapping their breeches, suing for peace, with the President.
[00:24:46.199 --> 00:24:57.204]  And I have told the President, every time I talked to him, I said, when you defeat them, in the next year, and they sue for peace, sir, that is when they're going to try to assassinate you.
[00:24:57.204 --> 00:24:58.605]  And he says,
[00:25:00.447 --> 00:25:01.847]  First time I've told him, he goes, very interesting.
[00:25:01.847 --> 00:25:02.888]  Hold on, Alex.
[00:25:02.888 --> 00:25:03.348]  He goes off.
[00:25:03.348 --> 00:25:05.128]  He goes, tell me more about that.
[00:25:05.128 --> 00:25:08.989]  And I'm not going to leave the rest of the conversation.
[00:25:08.989 --> 00:25:10.389]  I'm not going to tell you anymore.
[00:25:10.389 --> 00:25:17.331]  But Trump, as the media points out, does respect info wars and does respect our research because we're on target.
[00:25:17.331 --> 00:25:18.771]  It's what the audience does.
[00:25:18.771 --> 00:25:22.072]  And we have the sources.
[00:25:22.072 --> 00:25:24.933]  And that's why they battle to keep the president from our information.
[00:25:26.237 --> 00:25:28.118]  Because a lot of it doesn't just come from me.
[00:25:28.118 --> 00:25:32.319]  We're going to have Michael Caputo, former advisor to Trump, high-level, on.
[00:25:32.319 --> 00:25:33.480]  They try to keep him away from Caputo.
[00:25:33.480 --> 00:25:37.381]  We get through to him, through people close to the President, with this show.
[00:25:37.381 --> 00:25:41.463]  And the President does end up watching clips every week.
[00:25:41.463 --> 00:25:43.123]  He requests them.
[00:25:43.123 --> 00:25:47.325]  And I'm just letting the media know that, so they can know they failed miserably.
[00:25:47.325 --> 00:25:53.007]  Michael Caputo's coming on, Roger Stone, Dr. Corsi, because here's the big news.
[00:25:53.007 --> 00:25:54.888]  The purge of the globalists
[00:25:57.932 --> 00:26:09.883]  Not extrajudicially, not with death squads, not outside law, but through the Constitution and through the will of the people, begins next week.
[00:26:09.883 --> 00:26:11.484]  Get ready!
[00:26:11.484 --> 00:26:14.267]  Because the hammer is coming down.
[00:26:14.267 --> 00:26:16.929]  And the cleaning house is about to happen.
[00:26:16.929 --> 00:26:23.475]  And from the beginning there was a split in the Trump administration on whether he should let the globalists creep off with their money.
[00:26:24.403 --> 00:26:25.684]  Leave him alone.
[00:26:25.684 --> 00:26:28.826]  And they lied then and said they'd leave him alone, but they never did.
[00:26:28.826 --> 00:26:30.387]  And it wasn't like the President was selling out.
[00:26:30.387 --> 00:26:35.311]  You know, it might be best at one level not to have this civil war, not do all this, because the globalists are dangerous.
[00:26:35.311 --> 00:26:36.992]  But they'll never give up.
[00:26:36.992 --> 00:26:42.576]  I can tell you now, the President has decided to go on the offensive.
[00:26:42.576 --> 00:26:44.597]  And it's happening.
[00:26:44.597 --> 00:26:52.723]  Trump is getting ready to go on the offense in T-minus six and a half hours, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:26:52.723 --> 00:26:52.923]  So,
[00:26:55.163 --> 00:27:00.486]  Get ready for 2018 to be a whopper.
[00:27:00.486 --> 00:27:02.327]  Now understand this, though.
[00:27:02.327 --> 00:27:05.408]  We're not arrogant globalists that think we're invincible and are power drunk.
[00:27:05.408 --> 00:27:07.349]  We've got major beachheads.
[00:27:07.349 --> 00:27:08.590]  The public's starting to wake up.
[00:27:08.590 --> 00:27:11.611]  Globalism's in trouble because it's so authoritarian.
[00:27:11.611 --> 00:27:16.934]  But we've got to replace it at every level with integrity and honor and truth and justice and
[00:27:18.163 --> 00:27:28.951]  Classic populism and a respect of the people and a respect of women and a respect of men and a respect of children and a respect of each other.
[00:27:28.951 --> 00:27:35.035]  Because our country and the world has gone through grievous wounds of globalist engineering.
[00:27:35.035 --> 00:27:37.557]  And we're in deep trouble.
[00:27:37.557 --> 00:27:43.882]  I'm only happy because it's like we're in a coma and we started babbling and our eyes opened and
[00:27:44.793 --> 00:27:46.714]  You know, America's had a big bowel movement.
[00:27:46.714 --> 00:27:55.120]  We're kind of flopping around here on the table going, you know, but at least something's going on.
[00:27:55.120 --> 00:27:57.502]  And I use that gross analogy of someone that comes out of a big coma.
[00:27:57.502 --> 00:27:58.602]  That usually happens.
[00:27:58.602 --> 00:28:03.366]  I mean, I mean, we're, but you know, we're there folks.
[00:28:03.366 --> 00:28:07.969]  We're, we're coming out of the trance, the sleeping giants awakening and praise God.
[00:28:07.969 --> 00:28:12.732]  You know, I talked about how Trump absolutely is delivering
[00:28:14.571 --> 00:28:18.425]  And after all these decades of betrayal, wouldn't that be the smart move even for a sociopath?
[00:28:18.425 --> 00:28:19.991]  I'm not saying he's a sociopath, he's the opposite.
[00:28:22.759 --> 00:28:24.060]  People say, well, you better thank God.
[00:28:24.060 --> 00:28:26.042]  I thank God constantly.
[00:28:26.042 --> 00:28:35.311]  But I also want to thank you, and God thanks you, because you carry the light in the dark of the night, and I don't care what color you are or where you came from, I love you.
[00:28:35.311 --> 00:28:39.756]  And you're strong, and you've got will, and you're positive, and that's what really matters.
[00:28:39.756 --> 00:28:46.282]  The globalists want to make us negative, and out of control, and depressed, and only make it them that are the good guys.
[00:28:47.123 --> 00:28:56.315]  Man, they make it all about them and what group you're in instead of being who you are as an individual and your connection to the universe, your family, your neighbors, and God.
[00:28:56.315 --> 00:28:56.756]  We'll be back.
[00:28:58.436 --> 00:29:03.581]  Introducing Floralife, the new probiotic line developed exclusively by InfoWars Life.
[00:29:03.581 --> 00:29:08.366]  After years of research on the human microbiome, not all probiotics are made the same.
[00:29:08.366 --> 00:29:17.055]  Floralife probiotics use a unique targeted delivery system that bypasses the stomach and releases directly into the intestines for maximum effect.
[00:29:17.055 --> 00:29:20.298]  This is critical because stomach acid kills most probiotics
[00:29:20.538 --> 00:29:25.783]  So if you don't have a targeted delivery probiotic, then you're cheating your gut health and your wallet.
[00:29:25.783 --> 00:29:33.109]  Floralife supports your body's core, where you need it most, including digestion, regularity, immunity, the gut lining, and metabolism.
[00:29:33.109 --> 00:29:37.012]  Did you know that over 80% of your immune system is located in your gut?
[00:29:37.012 --> 00:29:41.737]  That's why increasing gut probiotic levels is so important for overall health.
[00:29:41.737 --> 00:29:45.320]  Floralife is sold as a 15 billion probiotic for everyday maintenance care.
[00:29:45.640 --> 00:29:49.805]  And a $50 billion probiotic for a 30-day advanced gut restoration program.
[00:29:49.805 --> 00:29:54.010]  Head to InfoWarsLife.com to pick up your bottle of Floralife probiotics today.
[00:29:54.010 --> 00:29:55.312]  That's InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:29:59.013 --> 00:30:01.974]  Top scientists and researchers agree.
[00:30:01.974 --> 00:30:11.117]  We are being hit by toxic weapons in the food and water supply that are making us fat, sick, and stupid.
[00:30:11.117 --> 00:30:12.478]  So what do we do about it?
[00:30:12.478 --> 00:30:15.619]  Well, for starters, don't just sit there and take it.
[00:30:15.819 --> 00:30:23.547]  Fight back with the all-new supercharged BrainForce Plus and feel the rush without the crash.
[00:30:23.547 --> 00:30:29.813]  BrainForce Plus is the next generation of advanced neural activation and nootropics.
[00:30:29.813 --> 00:30:37.741]  And now we've added a brand new ingredient called Black Pepper Fruit Extract that gives you an added kick.
[00:30:38.561 --> 00:30:51.289]  Other ingredients include vitamin B12 and neurological tonic and cognitive enhancers that will allow you to flip the switch and supercharge your state of mind.

[00:30:58.854 --> 00:31:06.419]  I want to plow into all of this, but I'm going to spend a few minutes here first just encouraging listeners to understand that
[00:31:07.995 --> 00:31:18.823]  When you buy t-shirts, or water filtration systems, or books, or videos, or other material from InfoWarsTore.com, you are funding the revolution.
[00:31:18.823 --> 00:31:20.944]  I mean, I cannot say it any clearer.

[00:31:24.947 --> 00:31:26.148]  I want to thank everybody that has, but

[00:31:37.215 --> 00:31:40.017]  That's my dad, with colloidal silver and iodine as well.

[00:31:58.689 --> 00:32:07.772]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide while also enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting 100% organic coffee on the planet.
[00:32:07.772 --> 00:32:16.174]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[00:32:16.174 --> 00:32:20.816]  We have now managed to secure the sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[00:32:21.056 --> 00:32:27.840]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee at Infowarslife.com.
[00:32:27.840 --> 00:32:35.024]  This coffee gives you a long, smooth pick-me-up for hours without the headaches and heartburn that so many other coffees give me personally.
[00:32:35.024 --> 00:32:42.048]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee, and it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[00:32:42.048 --> 00:32:46.371]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.
[00:32:46.511 --> 00:32:49.892]  Available in original or with our immune support infusion blend.
[00:32:49.892 --> 00:32:56.194]  You will be supporting a free press all the while enjoying a truly great tasting cup of my favorite coffee.
[00:32:56.194 --> 00:33:02.695]  Available at Infowarslife.com.
[00:33:02.695 --> 00:33:05.336]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:10.319 --> 00:33:15.521]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:15.521 --> 00:33:17.382]  Watch me!
[00:33:17.382 --> 00:33:18.363]  Watch me!
[00:33:18.363 --> 00:33:28.087]  Okay, Roger Stone has some of the biggest news he's ever broken coming on this broadcast in the last two and a half years.
[00:33:28.087 --> 00:33:31.168]  And when he told me this stuff yesterday, I wanted to go live with it.
[00:33:31.168 --> 00:33:32.469]  He said, no, it's not going to leak.
[00:33:32.469 --> 00:33:34.810]  So many times he tells me something and then it leaks.
[00:33:36.502 --> 00:33:41.025]  Just like, I mean, hundreds of times he breaks up before anybody else does.
[00:33:41.025 --> 00:33:51.071]  And of course that's admitted, but this is directly out of the mouth of one of the highest level people in the White House.
[00:33:51.071 --> 00:33:54.333]  Now they may change their mind about resigning, and it's not Tillerson.
[00:33:56.394 --> 00:34:00.917]  Tillerson was going to resign, and now he's doing some face-saving stuff, and it's back and forth.
[00:34:00.917 --> 00:34:02.638]  That could happen the next month.
[00:34:02.638 --> 00:34:03.579]  It's somebody else.
[00:34:03.579 --> 00:34:08.162]  This is important, though, because who they want to replace him with.
[00:34:08.162 --> 00:34:15.546]  So, that's coming up, and we've got Michael Caputo, former high-level Trump advisor, who's been accused of being a Russian agent with no evidence, just like I have.
[00:34:15.546 --> 00:34:17.007]  I'm like, call me into court.
[00:34:17.007 --> 00:34:19.569]  I want the FBI to come over here.
[00:34:19.569 --> 00:34:20.250]  I've said it on air.
[00:34:20.250 --> 00:34:22.151]  I've actually called them myself and demanded they come here.
[00:34:26.220 --> 00:34:28.282]  Put up or shut up.
[00:34:28.282 --> 00:34:30.443]  And of course, they're just like, yeah, they start laughing.
[00:34:30.443 --> 00:34:34.326]  Yes, Mr. Jones, we understand you're not a Russian agent, or of the Russians.
[00:34:34.326 --> 00:34:36.228]  I mean, I've said I want to be in front of Congress.
[00:34:36.228 --> 00:34:37.749]  I mean, I'm sick of this.
[00:34:37.749 --> 00:34:39.290]  I'm tired of this.
[00:34:39.290 --> 00:34:45.855]  Because I want lower taxes and sovereignty and to control our borders, and I'm pro-Christian and pro-free market.
[00:34:45.855 --> 00:34:46.976]  I'm a Russian agent?
[00:34:46.976 --> 00:34:49.598]  Well then, we'd better all be Russian agents then.
[00:34:49.598 --> 00:34:50.939]  Think how crazy that is.
[00:34:50.939 --> 00:34:54.902]  Once the Democrats and the globalists that hate this country, they've been trying to destroy it forever.
[00:34:57.671 --> 00:35:08.453]  But if you just joined us, I'm going to Dr. Jerome Corsi in this segment and the next, because he's been hammering on what is in the 8chan boards and QAnon and the rest of it.
[00:35:08.453 --> 00:35:09.593]  And you can look at what QAnon says.
[00:35:09.593 --> 00:35:11.093]  A lot of it's accurate, but that doesn't matter.
[00:35:11.093 --> 00:35:16.954]  We can see in real news what's happening and how Trump is purging the pedophiles.
[00:35:16.954 --> 00:35:18.455]  He is purging the money launderers.
[00:35:18.455 --> 00:35:19.915]  He is going after the globalists.
[00:35:19.915 --> 00:35:21.595]  This is all happening.
[00:35:21.595 --> 00:35:24.976]  And it's about to go supernova next year.
[00:35:24.976 --> 00:35:26.716]  His first year with Trump is salvage.
[00:35:28.280 --> 00:35:29.941]  Next year is destroy.
[00:35:29.941 --> 00:35:31.741]  That means go after the bad guys.
[00:35:31.741 --> 00:35:39.283]  And you've seen nothing but promise keeping on TPP, on NAFTA, on GATT, on tax cuts, on killing the single-payer mandate, which is Obamacare.
[00:35:39.283 --> 00:35:47.466]  I mean, quite frankly, Ronald Reagan got half done what Trump's done in eight years.
[00:35:47.466 --> 00:35:48.106]  Okay?
[00:35:48.106 --> 00:35:52.808]  And I'm not saying Reagan was a bad guy, but first year he was great, then he kind of went away.
[00:35:52.808 --> 00:35:53.468]  This is amazing.
[00:35:53.468 --> 00:35:56.609]  So that's coming up with exclusive info.
[00:35:57.526 --> 00:36:05.630]  But Trump is right about the FBI, New York Times, The Nation, Russiagate devolving into an effort to stigmatize dissent, The Nation.
[00:36:05.630 --> 00:36:06.691]  Here's another one.
[00:36:06.691 --> 00:36:08.932]  I don't even look for these, it's everywhere.
[00:36:08.932 --> 00:36:15.416]  Tampa Bay, in text, FBI officials in Russia inquiry said Clinton just has to win.
[00:36:15.416 --> 00:36:19.838]  Liberal publication says, it needs to end.
[00:36:19.838 --> 00:36:24.060]  FBI agent removed from Russia probe called Trump an idiot, Omaha World Herald.
[00:36:24.060 --> 00:36:25.121]  It goes on and on.
[00:36:26.499 --> 00:36:30.960]  They're only doing this because it's blown up in their face, and now they've gone and sued for peace.
[00:36:30.960 --> 00:36:41.184]  I can tell you they've gone to Mar-a-Lago, different globalist emissaries, and said, okay, you're right, okay, you're making the country great again, we'll leave you alone.
[00:36:41.184 --> 00:36:45.765]  That, I believe, at a gut level, is a foil.
[00:36:45.765 --> 00:36:47.145]  They're feigning.
[00:36:47.145 --> 00:36:51.327]  And then, when they feign this way, they're going to come back and try to stab us.
[00:36:51.327 --> 00:36:52.307]  That's their very nature.
[00:36:52.307 --> 00:36:52.987]  They're dishonorable.
[00:36:52.987 --> 00:36:54.288]  We'll talk to Dr. Corsi here in a moment.
[00:36:56.053 --> 00:36:59.837]  If you want to really be revolutionary, buy the products at Infowarsstore.com.
[00:36:59.837 --> 00:37:01.659]  And a lot of you are, and I salute you and thank you.
[00:37:01.659 --> 00:37:03.040]  It's how we've got a Washington, D.C.
[00:37:03.040 --> 00:37:04.122]  correspondent like Dr. Corsi.
[00:37:04.122 --> 00:37:07.225]  It's how we're getting all these other correspondents I'm going to announce in the next month.
[00:37:07.225 --> 00:37:09.968]  It's how we're building all these big new studios and expanding.
[00:37:09.968 --> 00:37:11.790]  And I'm putting everything back into this because...
[00:37:13.135 --> 00:37:14.036]  I'm totally committed.
[00:37:14.036 --> 00:37:15.758]  We're getting so censored on the internet.
[00:37:15.758 --> 00:37:19.221]  Thank God we're expanding on AM and FM and UHF, VHF and cable.
[00:37:19.221 --> 00:37:22.364]  But all these different stations want different types of satellites.
[00:37:22.364 --> 00:37:26.528]  I'm looking at a million and a half dollars a year to just deliver this to stations.
[00:37:26.528 --> 00:37:27.169]  And they're ready.
[00:37:27.169 --> 00:37:28.030]  Hundreds of stations.
[00:37:28.030 --> 00:37:29.871]  And you're like, well, I already listened to you.
[00:37:29.871 --> 00:37:30.132]  I know.
[00:37:30.132 --> 00:37:30.992]  It's for people that don't.
[00:37:31.913 --> 00:37:33.835]  And that sounds like a lot of money.
[00:37:33.835 --> 00:37:34.175]  It's not.
[00:37:34.175 --> 00:37:37.878]  Glenn Beck spent $25 million a year just on his Glenn Beck channel.
[00:37:37.878 --> 00:37:45.685]  But there's thousands of channels on cable, and I'm not a rocket scientist, but the consultants agree with me, because they tried to sell me Beck's channel.
[00:37:45.685 --> 00:37:47.066]  He tried to get out of it last year.
[00:37:49.053 --> 00:37:49.814]  Brokers did.
[00:37:49.814 --> 00:37:51.175]  They said, oh, well, he got it for $20 million.
[00:37:51.175 --> 00:37:52.577]  Well, it's $10 million a year for you.
[00:37:52.577 --> 00:37:53.818]  And I'm like, I'm not doing it.
[00:37:53.818 --> 00:37:56.221]  So I have my own Alex Jones Channel on cable.
[00:37:56.221 --> 00:37:57.081]  It doesn't matter now.
[00:37:57.081 --> 00:37:58.383]  It's oversaturated.
[00:37:58.383 --> 00:38:07.873]  But the reason I'm giving you Inside Baseball is to understand, I went, we need to be on all the satellites and systems so UHF, VHF, and cable stations can pick it up where they want it.
[00:38:08.493 --> 00:38:09.814]  And reach out to the program directors.
[00:38:09.814 --> 00:38:20.741]  Well, I never even launched these programs, but they're already just doing it off one satellite we're on, but I've got the wrong one, and it's like 400,000 a year, and there's a lot of rocket science goes into this, okay?
[00:38:20.741 --> 00:38:26.965]  But I'm just gonna put us on like five satellites, so everything they want is there, but it's gonna cost a million and a half dollars a year.
[00:38:26.965 --> 00:38:29.647]  Buy some vitamins, buy some minerals, buy some water filters.
[00:38:29.647 --> 00:38:30.787]  You need them, they're great.
[00:38:30.787 --> 00:38:32.589]  We're delivering, we're changing the world.
[00:38:32.589 --> 00:38:34.850]  We're the vanguard of the resurgence of America.
[00:38:34.850 --> 00:38:35.991]  You are supporting us.
[00:38:37.159 --> 00:38:40.143]  So we're all in this together, but they're coming after us.
[00:38:40.143 --> 00:38:41.926]  They're cutting off our sponsors.
[00:38:41.926 --> 00:38:43.288]  They cut us off Google Ads.
[00:38:43.288 --> 00:38:49.216]  They've got lawsuits that I don't want to get into going on behind the scenes because most of them have already been defeated.
[00:38:49.216 --> 00:38:52.220]  The point is that they're coming after us.
[00:38:52.921 --> 00:38:54.582]  Congress admits they censor us.
[00:38:54.582 --> 00:38:55.763]  Go get free shipping.
[00:38:55.763 --> 00:38:57.445]  It's about to end in the next two days.

[00:39:13.237 --> 00:39:16.639]  The probiotics, MycoZx, that knocks out the fungus and stuff in your gut.
[00:39:16.639 --> 00:39:17.639]  Nobody else has got that.
[00:39:17.639 --> 00:39:18.199]  It's incredible.

[00:39:54.428 --> 00:39:56.390]  I haven't even been paid yet this year.
[00:39:56.390 --> 00:40:04.036]  I'm spending everything I've got to hire people, to get crew, to get trained, to build more websites, to launch effectively in the enemy's face.

[00:40:14.625 --> 00:40:16.087]  A lot of this stuff's about to sell out.
[00:40:16.087 --> 00:40:18.669]  You like to do that before the end of the year if you don't have to pay tax on inventory.
[00:40:18.669 --> 00:40:20.791]  So we're going to be sold out of some of these things for months.
[00:40:21.331 --> 00:40:22.872]  Please take advantage today.

[00:40:27.993 --> 00:40:30.074]  Alright, we've got him for this segment.
[00:40:30.074 --> 00:40:40.618]  The next two, Dr. Jerome Corsi, best-selling, number one New York Times best-selling author, geopolitical expert, Harvard graduate, top expert on banking.
[00:40:41.258 --> 00:40:44.200]  Former State Department Advisor, he's joining us.
[00:40:44.200 --> 00:40:47.442]  We're going to break here in a few minutes, but Doc, we haven't talked in a couple weeks.
[00:40:47.442 --> 00:40:55.707]  Do you concur or what do you add to suddenly have establishment media saying, okay, Russiagate's a fraud, the FBI's been discredited, we've got to stop.
[00:40:55.707 --> 00:40:59.129]  This signals what we already know has gone on behind the scenes.
[00:40:59.129 --> 00:41:04.312]  They've run up the white flag to the President, at least for now, at least certain elements of it.
[00:41:04.312 --> 00:41:05.573]  I think this is a deception.
[00:41:05.573 --> 00:41:06.554]  What do you think, Dr. Corsi?
[00:41:07.265 --> 00:41:11.826]  Well, I think it's largely that the whole Russiagate narrative has failed.
[00:41:11.826 --> 00:41:13.646]  And that it's clear it's failed.
[00:41:13.646 --> 00:41:22.949]  I mean, even the New York Times is trying to substitute a narrative with one of the lower-down figures in the campaign talking trash, having drinks.
[00:41:22.949 --> 00:41:28.950]  I mean, the whole thing is clear that the Russiagate is in no evidence and has been no evidence from the beginning.
[00:41:29.677 --> 00:41:42.411]  And what you've had is it's turned on the Democrats in that now we know this Fusion GPS document was used to get the FISA wiretapping, the electronic surveillance.
[00:41:42.411 --> 00:41:43.432]  Donald Trump was right.
[00:41:43.432 --> 00:41:45.634]  He was under electronic surveillance.
[00:41:45.634 --> 00:41:46.696]  So was his campaign.
[00:41:47.566 --> 00:41:53.051]  And I think that basis of that wiretap, the Fusion GPS, is fraudulent.
[00:41:53.051 --> 00:41:53.872]  Well, of course it was.
[00:41:53.872 --> 00:42:00.318]  How could they be so arrogant to commit all these crimes, criminal leaks, make stuff up, and now be caught?
[00:42:00.318 --> 00:42:08.105]  A Clinton coterie, a cabal, in there trying to frame the President, thus the voters of America.
[00:42:08.105 --> 00:42:11.768]  I think they got used to, under the Clinton years of having this compliant
[00:42:12.555 --> 00:42:22.142]  Uh, mainstream media, lapdog media that repeated everything that Obama and Clinton wanted said, everything the deep state wanted parroted and broadcast.
[00:42:22.142 --> 00:42:27.166]  And what you find out is now you've got a situation where, uh, the public is listening to Donald Trump.
[00:42:27.166 --> 00:42:31.089]  Donald Trump is a whole different force to be reckoned with.
[00:42:31.089 --> 00:42:35.312]  And you know, the mainstream media, the deep state have never dealt with someone like Donald Trump.
[00:42:36.234 --> 00:42:42.019]  I think it's pretty startling what we've been reporting in the last week on this executive order that was signed.
[00:42:42.019 --> 00:42:43.160]  That's what's coming up next.
[00:42:43.160 --> 00:42:45.602]  I should have said I always save the best for last.
[00:42:45.602 --> 00:42:50.727]  You're coming on about the executive order going after the money launderers, the corrupt organized groups, the Clinton Foundation.
[00:42:50.727 --> 00:42:55.251]  What's the inside intel on Trump's speed as we go into 2018?
[00:42:55.251 --> 00:42:55.831]  Stay with us.
[00:42:58.024 --> 00:43:02.427]  Fill your body with Carnivore, the new digestive enzyme product by InfoWars Life.
[00:43:02.427 --> 00:43:10.532]  Digestive enzymes assist in the digestion process and increase the bioavailability of nutrients by breaking down foods into easily absorbable components.
[00:43:10.532 --> 00:43:15.815]  They also help prevent discomfort from indigestion caused by fermentation of undigested food particles in the gut.
[00:43:15.815 --> 00:43:18.357]  Digestive enzyme production declines as we age.
[00:43:18.357 --> 00:43:22.559]  Carnivore is filled with digestive enzymes like those naturally present in the body.
[00:43:22.559 --> 00:43:25.001]  Enjoy the full potential of protein-rich foods again.
[00:43:25.681 --> 00:43:32.926]  You can eat protein-heavy foods now while minimizing the later indigestion and discomfort commonly associated with high-meat diets.
[00:43:32.926 --> 00:43:40.990]  Just one pill with every high-protein meal helps increase the bioavailability and absorption of amino acids, the building blocks to your muscles.

[00:45:37.485 --> 00:45:47.093]  Harvest Right freeze dryers retain 97% of the food's taste, color, and nutritional value, and have a shelf life of up to 25 years.

[00:47:22.731 --> 00:47:24.072]  What does that signify?
[00:47:24.072 --> 00:47:28.354]  Trump's already delivered so much.
[00:47:31.212 --> 00:47:33.393]  In less than a year.
[00:47:33.393 --> 00:47:37.036]  What's coming next?
[00:47:37.036 --> 00:47:41.679]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:47:41.679 --> 00:47:43.980]  Live from Austin, Texas.
[00:47:43.980 --> 00:47:46.402]  Broadcasting worldwide.
[00:47:46.402 --> 00:47:49.423]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:47:49.423 --> 00:47:50.004]  We are go!
[00:47:51.072 --> 00:47:59.276]  Alright, Doc, lay it out in this segment for people because we know Trump is moving against the globalists.
[00:47:59.276 --> 00:48:01.877]  They are so treasonous, they're an outside power.
[00:48:01.877 --> 00:48:03.358]  This is important.
[00:48:03.358 --> 00:48:04.258]  It's very important.
[00:48:04.258 --> 00:48:06.439]  It's as important as World War II, quite frankly.
[00:48:06.439 --> 00:48:15.203]  Globalism, as you know, and we're a best-selling author working with Lou Dobbs, with the number one show on TV at the time, exposing that.
[00:48:16.127 --> 00:48:29.178]  And now here we are from being voices in the wilderness, myself, Ron Paul, Matt Drudge, so many others, President Trump 30 years ago, 29 years ago, whatever, writing op-eds against NAFTA and GATT.
[00:48:29.178 --> 00:48:35.203]  I mean, here we all are, and now we're moving into the position of not being in control, but
[00:48:36.104 --> 00:48:49.188]  Getting some of the tentacles off the throat of America, and we see life coming back in, and we see the globalists panicking, and we see now the emails of Aberdeen coming out, confirming that she had classified info and that Hillary lied.
[00:48:49.188 --> 00:48:52.049]  I mean, you can see that Trump has taken the gloves off.
[00:48:52.049 --> 00:48:53.129]  He's known for that.
[00:48:53.129 --> 00:48:57.691]  I think he gave Hillary and the globalists their chance to kind of, like Napoleon, go to the island of Alba.
[00:48:58.471 --> 00:49:00.952]  But I think, like Napoleon, they came back.
[00:49:00.952 --> 00:49:03.773]  And so this time, they're going to get locked up for real.
[00:49:03.773 --> 00:49:07.014]  Give us your analysis and where this is going.
[00:49:07.014 --> 00:49:09.054]  Trump is at war with the swamp.
[00:49:09.054 --> 00:49:11.215]  He's hired some swamp creatures to be his guides.
[00:49:11.215 --> 00:49:13.076]  But all I care about is results.
[00:49:13.076 --> 00:49:15.216]  We're getting unprecedented results.
[00:49:15.216 --> 00:49:18.317]  And quite frankly, I'm surprised how much results Trump's gotten.
[00:49:18.317 --> 00:49:20.218]  This is quite a turnabout here.
[00:49:21.201 --> 00:49:32.710]  Well, and we've been following, I've been very closely following this QAnon, and I started it when the executive order came out on the 21st, which was really, you know, just a few days ago.
[00:49:32.710 --> 00:49:42.919]  This executive order suddenly appears, President Trump signs it, and he says that this is against international trafficking, human rights violations.
[00:49:43.747 --> 00:49:51.213]  And the executive order declares that a national emergency exists, that a state of national emergency exists.
[00:49:51.213 --> 00:50:07.167]  It's not only that we have the Treasury Department has the right to confiscate the assets of those involved in human rights trafficking, but also that the state of emergency is in place, which means we're under martial law for this category of offenses.
[00:50:07.167 --> 00:50:12.211]  And then QAnon links it to Eric Schmidt, and Eric Schmidt resigns
[00:50:13.115 --> 00:50:13.675]  I don't think so.
[00:50:30.911 --> 00:50:42.593]  And it was clear that part of that narrative, central to it, was the fact that Eric Schmidt had funded Hillary, run her IT department, was involved very deeply in this crowd.
[00:50:42.593 --> 00:50:46.954]  And that ties into Pakistan.
[00:50:46.954 --> 00:50:48.155]  Right, ties into Pakistan.
[00:50:48.155 --> 00:50:53.756]  All this ties into the entire development of the Russian collusion narrative.
[00:50:53.756 --> 00:50:55.116]  Now, what it looks like,
[00:50:55.760 --> 00:50:59.863]  And you know, we've been able to confirm a variety of things from the QAnon.
[00:50:59.863 --> 00:51:02.946]  I mean, this national... Well, let me just say this to stop you.
[00:51:02.946 --> 00:51:03.947]  I'm gonna hold you in the next segment.
[00:51:03.947 --> 00:51:05.148]  Let me just say this to stop you.
[00:51:05.148 --> 00:51:05.468]  Right.
[00:51:05.468 --> 00:51:17.498]  I mean, you've been at the highest levels of banking, friends with Donald Trump, you've got all your own CIA connections, so do I. Where is the QAnon so important is, much of what he's saying is the same intel we're getting
[00:51:18.138 --> 00:51:21.080]  And then it's gotten attention, so it's a way to focus people.
[00:51:21.080 --> 00:51:26.402]  And we're not lessening QAnon or 8chan or the rest of it, but this is a real executive order.
[00:51:26.402 --> 00:51:31.885]  And as you said, a lot of my listeners went, Alex, this is martial law, this executive order.
[00:51:31.885 --> 00:51:33.686]  Well, we're under globalist attack.
[00:51:33.686 --> 00:51:34.766]  They've seized the country.
[00:51:34.766 --> 00:51:36.167]  He's cutting your taxes.
[00:51:36.167 --> 00:51:37.508]  He's securing the borders.
[00:51:37.508 --> 00:51:38.588]  He's taking care of the veterans.
[00:51:38.588 --> 00:51:39.809]  He's trying to take care of old people.
[00:51:40.069 --> 00:51:42.852]  He's getting rid of Obamacare meant to screw you over.
[00:51:42.852 --> 00:51:46.335]  When you're in a war, it's martial law against the globalists.
[00:51:46.335 --> 00:51:48.437]  If they start using it against the people, I'll go crazy.
[00:51:48.437 --> 00:51:50.098]  Hey, that's not what's happening.
[00:51:50.098 --> 00:52:00.027]  We're under globalist foundation control, and if Trump's going to take the gloves off when Deep State's openly saying kill him, and he's got to get geared up to do this, cutting off Saudi Arabia.
[00:52:01.048 --> 00:52:02.650]  Going and making them make a deal.
[00:52:02.650 --> 00:52:04.492]  Cutting off the Clinton's and Globalist's money.
[00:52:04.492 --> 00:52:05.653]  That's where it was coming from.
[00:52:05.653 --> 00:52:06.915]  That's what Vegas was about.
[00:52:06.915 --> 00:52:11.860]  I have my own military intelligence and CIA sources that are saying on air, like Zach.
[00:52:11.860 --> 00:52:13.281]  I'm not going to say his real name, obviously.
[00:52:13.281 --> 00:52:14.282]  Zach's his first name.
[00:52:14.282 --> 00:52:17.526]  Who are giving us the exact same intel before QAnon.
[00:52:17.526 --> 00:52:23.352]  So all I'm saying is, we're confirming what QAnon's saying from our own sources and it's incredibly bold.
[00:52:24.164 --> 00:52:30.369]  Well, and also, I think, you know, QAnon is clearly an intelligent source of one kind or another as inside information.
[00:52:30.369 --> 00:52:34.933]  I mean, I'm able to decode it from the background I've got in an intelligence.
[00:52:34.933 --> 00:52:40.758]  But QAnon is validating, Alex, the things that you've been saying for years.
[00:52:40.758 --> 00:52:43.160]  And, you know, that's where the affinity comes.
[00:52:43.160 --> 00:52:48.865]  He's giving, there's background here that validates all the points that you've been making about the globalists.
[00:52:48.865 --> 00:52:50.006]  The martial law is here.
[00:52:50.006 --> 00:52:52.348]  That martial law was declared in that executive order.
[00:52:52.948 --> 00:52:56.953]  And Trump is going after the money of human rights violators.
[00:52:56.953 --> 00:53:01.799]  Which again, explain, that's the main funding of the globalist system.
[00:53:01.799 --> 00:53:02.240]  Explain that.
[00:53:02.881 --> 00:53:03.822]  Yeah, well that's the key.
[00:53:03.822 --> 00:53:11.846]  I mean, the whole funding, this whole pedophilia, I mean, you were pounded months ago for going after this, but I think now it's going to be validated.
[00:53:11.846 --> 00:53:31.196]  You're going to be vindicated in 2018, because this whole pedophilia network, which is billions and billions of dollars, has been intertwined in Wall Street, it's intertwined in the news media, in Hollywood, you see it in the political circles.
[00:53:31.816 --> 00:53:33.557]  And I think Donald Trump's going after it.
[00:53:33.557 --> 00:53:35.759]  I mean, and it is validation.
[00:53:35.759 --> 00:53:43.645]  I wanted to point out, I was able to validate that this Arizona National Guard unit has just been moved from Phoenix.
[00:53:43.645 --> 00:53:54.733]  They moved about four dozen soldiers, part of the 850 unit National Guard, which are military police battalion, have just been moved to Gitmo.
[00:53:54.733 --> 00:53:59.276]  And that's after you had Secretary of Defense Mattis visit.
[00:53:59.996 --> 00:54:03.719]  You've had Attorney General Sessions visit Gitmo.
[00:54:03.719 --> 00:54:06.482]  I mean, clearly something is going on.
[00:54:06.482 --> 00:54:19.492]  And this executive order is a clear definition, declaration, that we are in a state of emergency, which gives the powers of the presidency really exceptional characteristics and abilities.
[00:54:20.353 --> 00:54:24.535]  The Democrats, people say, Alex, you're the one that always warned of this, now you're for it.
[00:54:24.535 --> 00:54:32.619]  The Democrats have announced, we want a state of emergency, we want civil unrest, we want Trump arrested or killed, we want to kill all the Republicans, hashtag kill Republicans.
[00:54:32.619 --> 00:54:36.061]  They're building towards this emergency, as they said, in December.
[00:54:36.661 --> 00:54:40.824]  So Trump put this in with the intel to basically block their funding.
[00:54:40.824 --> 00:54:42.546]  He already cut off Saudi Arabia.
[00:54:42.546 --> 00:54:46.249]  So again, folks, he's blocking them with the executive power.
[00:54:46.249 --> 00:54:50.973]  They're wrongly trying to launch this without executive power as a rogue group.
[00:54:50.973 --> 00:54:52.794]  Clearly, this is what's happening.
[00:54:52.794 --> 00:55:01.001]  And the word is that what we're seeing with QAnon and my other sources that are confirmed, high-level Army Special Operations Command, you name it,
[00:55:01.741 --> 00:55:09.687]  Is that this, what we're seeing from QAnon is warnings to Hillary, and warnings to Soros, that you're gonna be in Gitmo if you keep pushing it.
[00:55:09.687 --> 00:55:11.268]  Not that they're actually going to be going there.
[00:55:11.268 --> 00:55:12.469]  Go ahead.
[00:55:12.469 --> 00:55:29.361]  Well, and also, Alex, I want to point out that the two gentlemen who run the QAnon in 8chan, and also on the Reddit, the subreddit, which is, you know, the Calm Before the Storm, CBTS, underscore, stream,
[00:55:30.980 --> 00:55:37.965]  You came on your show last week and spent a good deal of time and it was all over the subreddit.
[00:55:37.965 --> 00:55:45.150]  You just called before the storm slash stream and with hundreds of responses to it, a couple hundred that I read.
[00:55:46.002 --> 00:55:53.749]  So you see the QAnon is acknowledging that, in fact, you, Alex, have been ahead of the curve and that your audience is ahead of the curve.
[00:55:53.749 --> 00:55:54.249]  Well, exactly.
[00:55:54.249 --> 00:55:55.631]  It's not about you.
[00:55:55.631 --> 00:55:57.212]  I know you're just pointing out we've been right.
[00:55:57.212 --> 00:55:58.113]  But again, it's not about us.
[00:55:58.113 --> 00:55:59.954]  I'm just pointing out this is real.
[00:55:59.954 --> 00:56:05.319]  We've had Phil Mudd, the former head of counterterrorism, saying we're going to kill the president on CNN.
[00:56:05.319 --> 00:56:08.282]  I mean, they did that to rally their troops to say...
[00:56:10.003 --> 00:56:10.944]  What's the word though?
[00:56:10.944 --> 00:56:15.267]  Because the last five days they have been signaling that they're backing off.
[00:56:15.267 --> 00:56:17.989]  They crapped their pants after this executive order.
[00:56:17.989 --> 00:56:21.152]  McCabe announced he's resigning, leaving.
[00:56:21.152 --> 00:56:25.655]  Schmidt, I mean, they're really signaling that they're scared.
[00:56:25.655 --> 00:56:30.039]  Well, I think what we're seeing is this is the beginning of the Trump counterattack.
[00:56:30.732 --> 00:56:32.794]  And it has, I think, two elements to it.
[00:56:32.794 --> 00:56:36.818]  One is, you see, Trump very effectively working now with Congress.
[00:56:36.818 --> 00:56:38.699]  Nunes in the Senate.
[00:56:38.699 --> 00:56:56.336]  You're going to see Gowdy and Jim Jordan in the House, who are going to press these issues of McCabe and Strozak and all the holdovers from Obama that were really determined to run a very biased FBI and Department of Justice that was going to get, excuse Hillary of everything,
[00:56:56.836 --> 00:57:02.278]  And go after Trump on fake charges of this whole Russian collusion issue.
[00:57:02.278 --> 00:57:09.080]  Now what you've got in this, what you've got going on, I think, extremely here, is that Trump is saying, I've had enough of it.
[00:57:09.080 --> 00:57:10.960]  And what he's going to do is he's going to counterattack.
[00:57:10.960 --> 00:57:13.941]  He's going to say, I'm coming after you and we're going to get the money.
[00:57:14.548 --> 00:57:25.913]  The money is going to be the number one target, and the money is, I think, cut off, is going to severely limit the ability of the, you know, of the deep state to operate.
[00:57:25.913 --> 00:57:28.174]  And by the way, folks, you know we don't engage in hype.
[00:57:28.174 --> 00:57:29.715]  Stay right there.
[00:57:29.715 --> 00:57:33.317]  This is the most wild news to end the year with, but it's all there, I mean.
[00:57:34.057 --> 00:57:35.399]  The globalists want a civil war?
[00:57:35.399 --> 00:57:36.580]  They want to do all this stuff?
[00:57:36.580 --> 00:57:38.823]  Well, we punch back and we punch hard.

[00:59:52.204 --> 00:59:54.824]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:03.806 --> 01:00:05.727]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[01:00:05.727 --> 01:00:09.590]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:16.357 --> 01:00:23.218]  Ladies and gentlemen, Dr. Corsi is a Harvard-educated political scientist, three-time number one New York Times bestseller.
[01:00:23.218 --> 01:00:41.122]  He doesn't hype stuff up, as you know, and I'll be honest with you, I'm not mad at myself, but when I read the executive order last week, I said, this is martial law, and I understood what the president was doing, and I meant to come on air and say it's basically financial martial law against multinational combines and these big foundations.
[01:00:43.097 --> 01:00:45.141]  And then I just never came on air and did it.
[01:00:45.141 --> 01:00:51.053]  But Corsi is now breaking it down and we really are under a civil emergency.
[01:00:51.053 --> 01:00:54.340]  A national emergency has been declared by President Trump.
[01:00:55.523 --> 01:00:59.706]  But the globalists were announcing they want their own national emergency and to take Trump out.
[01:00:59.706 --> 01:01:06.031]  So it's very constitutional what he's doing as president when an outside group is doing this and he's only targeting them.
[01:01:06.031 --> 01:01:09.934]  And he went and made deals with Saudi Arabia to cut off the funding to the globalists.
[01:01:09.934 --> 01:01:10.875]  Big things are happening.
[01:01:10.875 --> 01:01:13.417]  This is so epic, I can't believe it.
[01:01:13.417 --> 01:01:18.781]  And everything Trump's doing is delivering power back to the people as he pledged a year and
[01:01:22.112 --> 01:01:25.695]  11 months and 11 days ago, or whatever it was, on January 20th, 2017.
[01:01:25.695 --> 01:01:29.118]  So as we end the year, we've got about four minutes left.
[01:01:29.118 --> 01:01:33.462]  Dr. Corsi, this is so epic, this is so big, this is so huge.
[01:01:33.462 --> 01:01:48.094]  Well, I think you see, first of all, with Saudi Arabia, Donald Trump visited Saudi Arabia, and then very quickly after that, the prince begins to round up all of the key operatives in Saudi Arabia and takes their money.
[01:01:48.743 --> 01:01:50.304]  Confiscates their money.
[01:01:50.304 --> 01:01:56.106]  Alawede, who is very, very... The main funder of Obama and Hillary, and now it's happening here!
[01:01:56.106 --> 01:02:10.532]  And the, in this recent executive order, and what the Treasury came out with in an annex, the people they're going after, you know, the vast majority of them have deep ties to the Clinton Foundation, have deep ties to the Clinton Global Initiative.
[01:02:10.532 --> 01:02:16.995]  These are international criminals that engage in a variety of activities, including human rights abuses and human trafficking.
[01:02:17.495 --> 01:02:23.176]  Now, if Donald Trump is going after the money again, this is warfare.
[01:02:23.176 --> 01:02:33.718]  This is a clear indication that Donald Trump understands the deep state's use of money and their corruption in human resources.
[01:02:33.718 --> 01:02:39.419]  You're going to see millionaires suddenly leave the United States without explanation.
[01:02:39.419 --> 01:02:43.040]  You're going to see CEOs resigning without explanation.
[01:02:43.040 --> 01:02:44.740]  You're going to see suicides occur.
[01:02:45.470 --> 01:02:48.951]  This is going to be massive, I believe, and I think it's already started.
[01:02:48.951 --> 01:02:51.212]  And Donald Trump is in a counterattack.
[01:02:51.212 --> 01:02:57.393]  2018 is going to be the year of Donald Trump's counterattack.
[01:02:57.393 --> 01:03:01.494]  Well, there's the headline on this epic live interview, Radio TV.
[01:03:01.494 --> 01:03:08.056]  I'm going to have it posted with that very headline, that 2018 is the year of Donald Trump's counterattack.
[01:03:09.315 --> 01:03:13.216]  That's so sensational and true, but I mean, it's even more sensational.
[01:03:13.216 --> 01:03:22.378]  He's declared civil emergency to actually block them before they declare the civil emergency outside of law and cut their money off, and he's done it!
[01:03:22.378 --> 01:03:23.778]  I mean, it's amazing.
[01:03:23.778 --> 01:03:33.280]  Can you believe we've been so used to corruption and evil to now actually see a very pragmatic, kind of JFK-style tax plan that's actually for the people?
[01:03:33.280 --> 01:03:35.581]  I mean, I am just so proud that we backed Trump, Corsi.
[01:03:36.448 --> 01:03:39.389]  Well, Donald Trump's the chief executive.
[01:03:39.389 --> 01:03:40.690]  He understands.
[01:03:40.690 --> 01:03:51.235]  This is the first time we've really had a president who's going to use the enormous powers of the presidency for eliminating corruption, not for advancing corruption.
[01:03:51.235 --> 01:03:52.515]  They fired every lobbyist.
[01:03:52.515 --> 01:03:54.536]  He actually fired all lobbyists.
[01:03:54.536 --> 01:03:55.656]  That's why they're pissed.
[01:03:55.656 --> 01:03:58.978]  There's no lobbyists there giving him ideas.
[01:03:58.978 --> 01:04:04.460]  He fired the whole section of the HIV AIDS group that was in the White House.
[01:04:04.460 --> 01:04:05.861]  Just got rid of them, the whole group.
[01:04:06.953 --> 01:04:10.576]  He's firing left and right, not hiring in the same department.
[01:04:10.576 --> 01:04:13.859]  Even CNN admitted that he has massively cut the government.
[01:04:13.859 --> 01:04:14.339]  Yes.
[01:04:14.339 --> 01:04:17.601]  Except for Veterans Affairs and the military.
[01:04:17.601 --> 01:04:20.183]  And the presidency has enormous powers.
[01:04:20.183 --> 01:04:32.573]  He's using them on executive orders to eliminate what he can of the government, regulations, and now he's going to go after human rights violations, which is going to be epic.
[01:04:33.133 --> 01:04:39.760]  I want you to join me for a full hour, a full hour tomorrow or Tuesday, Dr. Corsi, to really walk through this because it's happening.
[01:04:39.760 --> 01:04:41.081]  This is real.
[01:04:41.081 --> 01:04:41.902]  Wow.
[01:04:41.902 --> 01:04:42.502]  Wow.
[01:04:42.502 --> 01:04:46.906]  How will the deep state counter-strike back though?
[01:04:46.906 --> 01:04:47.427]  Stay with us.
[01:04:47.427 --> 01:04:50.850]  Roger Stone is coming, coming up, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:04:50.850 --> 01:04:54.353]  And then we've got Milo DiPuto, another top Trump former advisor.

[01:04:54.794 --> 01:04:55.755]  Please spread the live links.

[01:06:08.032 --> 01:06:12.417]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:06:12.417 --> 01:06:14.819]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[01:06:48.514 --> 01:07:05.306]  I'll be honest with you, ladies and gentlemen, I intended to go to the grocery store yesterday and get a couple bottles of Dom Perignon or whatever to, I'm not a big champagne drinker, but to drink them here less than a year later with Roger Stone tonight.
[01:07:07.173 --> 01:07:08.453]  But I never called Roger.
[01:07:08.453 --> 01:07:10.114]  I never, you know, did it.
[01:07:10.114 --> 01:07:16.395]  And then, sure enough, I see him punched up on the Skype here in the studio for the TV slash radio simulcast.
[01:07:16.395 --> 01:07:20.876]  And there he is in a tuxedo with a martini.
[01:07:20.876 --> 01:07:22.356]  I'm sure a dry martini.
[01:07:22.356 --> 01:07:26.777]  I don't have a drink here to toast him, but I'll toast my Aromante tea.
[01:07:26.777 --> 01:07:30.737]  Because I've got to bet about nine at night I don't drink Aromante at this time.
[01:07:30.737 --> 01:07:31.277]  But I don't know.
[01:07:31.277 --> 01:07:33.358]  Is that good luck to toast iced tea?
[01:07:34.738 --> 01:07:40.022]  With South American iced tea, with a martini shaken, not stirred.
[01:07:40.022 --> 01:07:48.488]  We'll see, but boy, talk about celebration, talk about delivery, talk about us getting used to being lied to and told that politicians would never tell the truth.
[01:07:48.488 --> 01:07:48.868]  Well, guess what?
[01:07:48.868 --> 01:07:50.329]  Donald Trump isn't one.
[01:07:50.329 --> 01:07:52.831]  And he's draining the swamp, he's on the offense.
[01:07:52.831 --> 01:07:54.792]  We're going to get into big breaking news.
[01:07:54.792 --> 01:08:00.877]  We've given you positive news about the president going after the globalists declaring financial martial law over the foundations.
[01:08:01.657 --> 01:08:03.038]  Alex, Happy New Year.
[01:08:03.038 --> 01:08:05.220]  I hope you had a terrific holiday season.
[01:08:05.220 --> 01:08:07.401]  Boy, the President has delivered our presents.
[01:08:25.402 --> 01:08:40.029]  In spades, the elitists are hysterical, near suicidal because both on the economic front, on the foreign policy front, the president is doing exactly what he told the American people he would do.
[01:08:40.729 --> 01:08:43.532]  Something that's unheard of in American politics.
[01:08:43.532 --> 01:08:49.037]  A candidate who gets elected and actually delivers on their platform.
[01:08:49.037 --> 01:08:55.724]  And now with this new executive order, which David and I spoke about extensively yesterday morning,
[01:08:56.460 --> 01:09:00.543]  He's laid the groundwork for a sweep up of the bad guys.
[01:09:00.543 --> 01:09:20.035]  You can see that this was specifically tailored for the Uranium One situation, for a sweep up of Bill, Hillary, and perhaps even Barack Obama himself, in terms of the massive crimes that they have been exposed on in just the last three weeks.
[01:09:20.035 --> 01:09:24.058]  And by the way, everybody knows we don't hype stuff here, we just lay out the facts.
[01:09:25.200 --> 01:09:33.752]  Suddenly, I saw the executive order last week and I had you on, I had Corsi, and I agree that's where it's going, and the Saudi Arabian deal and all of it, cutting off their money.
[01:09:33.752 --> 01:09:41.422]  But now, not just Schmidt, not just McCabe resigning, you have suddenly hundreds of leftist newspapers, CNN, The Nation,
[01:09:43.344 --> 01:09:49.732]  You name it, saying it's all a fraud, the Russiagate was a fraud, it was criminal, it was terrible, the Clintons are evil.
[01:09:49.732 --> 01:09:53.696]  They're finally giving up the ghost, I believe, at least on the surface.
[01:09:53.696 --> 01:10:01.025]  So let's get into their counter-strike, or you know, we know they're duplicitous, there's no honor amongst thieves, but to you, the listeners, everybody else,
[01:10:01.845 --> 01:10:05.866]  I think the age of treachery that we've been in for 50 years is beginning to turn.
[01:10:05.866 --> 01:10:10.128]  That means there's some utopia we're about to enter, but the age of honor is coming back.
[01:10:10.128 --> 01:10:16.250]  So here is the sun coming back, here is the light coming back, and here is to you, Roger Stone, to President Trump and our listeners.
[01:10:16.250 --> 01:10:18.330]  I salute you all, my friend.
[01:10:18.330 --> 01:10:19.251]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:10:19.251 --> 01:10:26.433]  And here's to you and the entire Vanguard at InfoWars, because you have been the cutting edge of this revolution.
[01:10:27.287 --> 01:10:28.768]  Well, I don't want to brag about it.
[01:10:28.768 --> 01:10:30.369]  The history books have to be written.
[01:10:30.369 --> 01:10:31.589]  It's just an example of victory.
[01:10:31.589 --> 01:10:32.710]  We've both gone through hell.
[01:10:32.710 --> 01:10:43.275]  They tried to kill you and they asked you to classify that you were hit with a polonium and they've tried to destroy everything I've got and come pretty close and, you know, tried to take my kids away from me.
[01:10:43.275 --> 01:10:44.615]  It's been a serious, but you know what?
[01:10:44.615 --> 01:10:45.816]  I don't feel, I'm not an SJW.
[01:10:45.816 --> 01:10:47.057]  I don't feel sorry for myself.
[01:10:47.057 --> 01:10:49.158]  These scars are my
[01:10:50.018 --> 01:10:51.318]  My masterwork.
[01:10:51.318 --> 01:10:54.639]  I mean, this scarred body, I love it.
[01:10:54.639 --> 01:10:56.360]  I love the battle scars.
[01:10:56.360 --> 01:10:58.481]  I just love being a man, Roger.
[01:10:58.481 --> 01:11:01.001]  Not a superstar, not a superman, but a man.
[01:11:01.001 --> 01:11:07.783]  I mean, how good does it feel to see real history now with our fingertips and our listeners' and activists' fingertips all over it?
[01:11:07.783 --> 01:11:10.524]  I mean, this is epic.
[01:11:10.524 --> 01:11:13.625]  That which does not kill us makes us stronger.
[01:11:14.341 --> 01:11:27.570]  I have no doubt whatsoever, Alex, that Donald Trump could not have been nominated without the support of InfoWars and the entire alternative conservative community across the board.
[01:11:27.570 --> 01:11:35.636]  2016 was the year in which the mainstream media lost their stranglehold on the entire dissemination of political information.
[01:11:35.636 --> 01:11:40.880]  Now they seek, I think too late, to put the toothpaste back in the tube.
[01:11:40.880 --> 01:11:42.641]  But make no mistake about it.
[01:11:43.391 --> 01:11:46.992]  The deep state does intend to counter attack.
[01:11:46.992 --> 01:11:50.093]  They are not just going to go quietly.
[01:11:50.093 --> 01:11:54.714]  They are continuing to plot and scheme against this president.
[01:11:54.714 --> 01:12:03.056]  Now, I know with the president ending the year on a high with his massive tax cut, the largest tax cut in US history.
[01:12:04.159 --> 01:12:17.612]  And a real surge in the stock market, historic lows in unemployment, a boom in the housing market, a new confidence in America around the globe, that this will seem far-fetched to some.
[01:12:18.308 --> 01:12:23.072]  Some will scoff and say, oh, you fellows are just conspiracy theorists.
[01:12:23.072 --> 01:12:23.852]  No.
[01:12:23.852 --> 01:12:25.414]  Let me be as clear as I can.
[01:12:25.414 --> 01:12:31.718]  The 25th Amendment strategy that I have outlined here on InfoWars is still very much afoot.
[01:12:31.718 --> 01:12:33.940]  And that will be accompanied by drugging of his food.
[01:12:33.940 --> 01:12:35.521]  We'll talk about it next segment.
[01:12:35.521 --> 01:12:38.263]  But right now, I want to get into the victory with you.
[01:12:38.263 --> 01:12:42.166]  And then I want to get into their counterstrikes and the big news you're going to be breaking about.
[01:12:42.166 --> 01:12:45.009]  Who's going to be leaving the administration next in the big fight there?
[01:12:46.483 --> 01:12:58.929]  What does it mean to have CNN, The New York Times, The Nation, and so many papers, I can't even list them all, I covered them earlier, admitting it's all a fraud, it's an attack on free speech.
[01:12:58.929 --> 01:13:00.510]  Some of these things have you front page.
[01:13:00.510 --> 01:13:03.932]  Here it is, Russiagate is devolving into an effort to stigmatize dissent.
[01:13:03.932 --> 01:13:06.953]  It's got you testifying on Capitol Hill.
[01:13:06.953 --> 01:13:08.874]  All of this, what does that signify?
[01:13:08.874 --> 01:13:10.955]  Because that can't just be plain possum.
[01:13:12.236 --> 01:13:13.918]  Well, this has been a failed gambit.
[01:13:13.918 --> 01:13:18.663]  The entire argument that Donald Trump was assisted in his election by Vladimir Putin and the Russians has collapsed.
[01:13:32.933 --> 01:13:40.436]  It's collapsed of its own weight because there is absolutely no evidence whatsoever that that is the case.
[01:13:40.436 --> 01:13:52.880]  But it wouldn't be a mistake, Alex, to think that CNN and the hardcore left, the George Soros financed cabal that has run this country for the last 30 years, is going to throw in the towel.
[01:13:52.880 --> 01:13:53.540]  They can't give up.
[01:13:54.432 --> 01:14:19.698]  I see a real difference between responsible, yes, even patriotic liberals who are just misguided in their views, but who don't hate America, like some of the folks at The Nation, who have reached the right conclusion, which is to say the entire Russian charade is an attempt to stifle free expression, and that they've come up empty-handed despite the fact that they've
[01:14:19.998 --> 01:14:24.561]  Sure, and it's destroying the FBI, but what would CNN... Have you seen?
[01:14:24.561 --> 01:14:29.244]  CNN now has multiple articles saying, quote, Trump was right about the FBI.
[01:14:30.544 --> 01:14:31.365]  That's today.
[01:14:31.365 --> 01:14:33.867]  What will they say tomorrow?
[01:14:33.867 --> 01:14:38.731]  In other words, I think that is a tactic rather than a change in strategy.
[01:14:38.731 --> 01:14:44.076]  And they know that the president is having a very, very strong December, to say the least.
[01:14:44.076 --> 01:14:47.039]  That he's going into the new year with the wind to his back.
[01:14:47.039 --> 01:14:53.084]  So they're just leaning on the robes right now, knowing it's killing them to be anti-American recovery.
[01:14:53.084 --> 01:14:54.885]  So they're just kind of recessing into the shadows.
[01:14:55.646 --> 01:15:01.187]  Well, I have a number of things to report about the plot that is afoot when we get to the next segment.
[01:15:01.187 --> 01:15:14.390]  But Alex, in the meantime, I really hope that the expansion of InfoWars can continue and that folks will go to the InfoWars store because it's programming just like this that's paid for by our listeners.
[01:15:14.390 --> 01:15:18.531]  We don't have any wealthy billionaire right-wingers standing in the wings.
[01:15:18.531 --> 01:15:19.471]  No, George Soros.
[01:15:21.124 --> 01:15:22.305]  We have no George Soros.
[01:15:22.305 --> 01:15:24.506]  I'm glad you mentioned that, because we're on a break right now.
[01:15:24.506 --> 01:15:25.726]  Absolutely.
[01:15:25.726 --> 01:15:26.807]  We deliver.
[01:15:26.807 --> 01:15:30.449]  And if there was anything you ever invested in, you get great products at the same time.
[01:15:30.449 --> 01:15:38.753]  Buying products at Infowars, best products, best prices, whether it's water filters, air filters, shirts, clothing, high quality supplements.
[01:15:38.753 --> 01:15:47.638]  You cannot get better products at better prices, and you cannot fund a more savage group of people committed, like Kamikazes, to taking on communism, globalism,
[01:15:47.938 --> 01:15:50.426]  Pedophilia and Satanism and crushing the state.
[01:15:50.426 --> 01:15:51.770]  I mean, this is it, folks.
[01:15:51.770 --> 01:15:53.395]  So support us in the new year.
[01:15:53.395 --> 01:15:54.498]  Infowarsstore.com.
[01:15:54.498 --> 01:15:55.541]  Free shipping storewide right now.
[01:15:57.395 --> 01:15:59.036]  Matt in Ohio, you're on the air.
[01:15:59.036 --> 01:15:59.996]  Another Matt, go ahead.
[01:15:59.996 --> 01:16:14.604]  Yeah, hey, listen, I just wanted to say real quick, I'm a longtime listener of InfoWars, and I just wanted to say that the t-shirts that you guys are offering are absolutely fantastic, and that really is a great way to deal with this battle in the InfoWars.
[01:16:14.604 --> 01:16:21.848]  It might seem like a simple thing, but particularly these slogan t-shirts that you guys got up right now are absolutely amazing.
[01:16:22.188 --> 01:16:22.709]  Well, thank you.
[01:16:22.709 --> 01:16:27.633]  My favorite new one is the Don't Tread On Me, but instead it says Won't Tread On Me.
[01:16:27.633 --> 01:16:30.575]  And it's a big Dayglo snake, Gadsden snake.
[01:16:30.575 --> 01:16:33.858]  And then it's got the American flag, Infowars.com on the right arm.
[01:16:33.858 --> 01:16:40.103]  I mean, that's a great way just to meet like-minded people and spread the word and also exercise free speech.
[01:16:40.103 --> 01:16:42.365]  And the newest one is Trigger Warning T-shirt.
[01:16:43.266 --> 01:16:50.116]  Trigger warning t-shirt, which is the symbol of a trigger with a yield sign and then InfoWars.com on the back.
[01:16:50.116 --> 01:16:54.642]  That is the new Shirt of the Month, available exclusively at InfoWarsStore.com.

[01:17:06.107 --> 01:17:12.352]  Most men know that testosterone levels begin to decline starting around 30 at a rate of about 1-2% per year.
[01:17:14.133 --> 01:17:21.300]  This drop can show signs such as fatigue, low energy, low sex drive, and muscle loss.

[01:18:05.887 --> 01:18:14.295]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[01:18:14.295 --> 01:18:18.939]  We have now managed to secure the sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.

[01:18:25.944 --> 01:18:33.149]  This coffee gives you a long, smooth pick-me-up for hours without the headaches and heartburn that so many other coffees give me personally.
[01:18:33.149 --> 01:18:40.154]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee, and it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[01:18:40.154 --> 01:18:44.497]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.
[01:18:44.617 --> 01:18:47.999]  Available in original or with our immune support infusion blend.

[01:18:57.026 --> 01:19:07.373]  We have developed with the top firms the United States powerful 50 billion live organism probiotic flora life that is so critical
[01:19:08.700 --> 01:19:11.320]  To having a healthy gut and a healthy life.
[01:19:11.320 --> 01:19:14.621]  And that has changed my life and so many other people's lives.
[01:19:14.621 --> 01:19:24.303]  The other part is a compound like MycoZx that has all these key ingredients of organic herbs and other systems that are known to break down this garbage in the body.

[01:19:49.257 --> 01:19:50.538]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:21.984 --> 01:20:23.524]  InfoWars.com.
[01:20:23.524 --> 01:20:32.867]  From deep in the heart of FEMA Region 6, Austin, Texas, transmitting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[01:20:32.867 --> 01:20:37.268]  But see, the whole globalist shadow government program can cut both ways against the New World Order.
[01:20:38.450 --> 01:20:40.935]  They wanted to run their operation, Valkyrie, we're running ours.
[01:20:40.935 --> 01:20:46.246]  By the way, I met with my CPA, who's also on a bunch of boards at major corporations.
[01:20:46.246 --> 01:20:48.089]  He's one of the top CPAs in Texas.
[01:20:49.514 --> 01:20:59.621]  And he was very proud of it, and so was I. We're both paying more taxes under the Trump plan, because we're nouveau riche, upper middle class, not super wealthy, but wealthy, successful.
[01:20:59.621 --> 01:21:05.446]  And they got rid of the exemption on the property taxes above $10,000 and did a bunch of other stuff.
[01:21:05.446 --> 01:21:09.168]  So yeah, I got a two-point cut in income taxes, but the other stuff I'm paying more.
[01:21:09.168 --> 01:21:09.549]  I love it.
[01:21:10.149 --> 01:21:18.494]  I don't like the globalist fat cat liberals having $20 million houses and putting all their stuff in that and paying no tax, basically, federally with their exemption.
[01:21:18.494 --> 01:21:20.596]  And so Cuomo and others are so pissed.
[01:21:20.596 --> 01:21:21.476]  You're right!
[01:21:21.476 --> 01:21:28.441]  All you liberal, ultra-rich people, you know, they admit liberals in Congress have 70 plus percent of the money.
[01:21:29.281 --> 01:21:41.492]  I'm sick of filthy rich tax-exempt jerks like Bezos that's taxpayer-funded with stuff he got Obama to pass telling a working family making $200,000 a year that they're rich pigs.
[01:21:41.492 --> 01:21:47.538]  They all got big tax cuts and people making 50 grand did and now all these bonuses and I love it!
[01:21:48.118 --> 01:21:51.720]  And I love paying more taxes if it means getting the country going!
[01:21:51.720 --> 01:21:52.901]  Roger Stone, what do you say to this?
[01:21:52.901 --> 01:21:54.282]  And then get into all your huge news.
[01:21:54.282 --> 01:21:57.144]  Now you got huge news, you're gonna ride shotgun with Caputo coming up.
[01:21:57.144 --> 01:22:07.371]  But man, just seeing Trump deliver, it's just so good after the dark night of liars with the Democrats and Republicans scumbags to see somebody who isn't out to rape the country.
[01:22:08.755 --> 01:22:18.223]  Well Alex, I love it when you call Governor Cuomo out because a very, very prominent New Yorker went to Governor Cuomo only days ago and said,
[01:22:19.629 --> 01:22:35.144]  Since you no longer have the deductibility of New York's very high income taxes, why not have New York taxpayers pay that money to a tax-free foundation, to a non-profit, which would then give it to the state.
[01:22:35.144 --> 01:22:40.890]  They could take the deduction, the state would get the money, everybody would benefit.
[01:22:40.890 --> 01:22:43.873]  And the governor's response was, not interested.
[01:22:44.511 --> 01:22:47.752]  No, he's only interested in trashing President Trump.
[01:22:47.752 --> 01:22:54.574]  He's not interested in a true solution and lower taxes for the people of the Empire State.
[01:22:54.574 --> 01:22:57.895]  So Alex, I think you hit it right on the head.
[01:22:57.895 --> 01:23:09.919]  For the vast majority of working Americans, this tax cut is evocative of the tax cuts of Ronald Reagan, John F. Kennedy, and we know that a rising tide lifts all boats.
[01:23:09.919 --> 01:23:11.920]  Well think about Trump, how much property he owns.
[01:23:11.920 --> 01:23:12.600]  This is a huge
[01:23:13.340 --> 01:23:14.260]  This is the untold story.
[01:23:14.260 --> 01:23:16.541]  I was doing the math last night just on what's available.
[01:23:16.541 --> 01:23:20.142]  This looks like he's going to lose hundreds of millions of dollars a year on right off himself.
[01:23:20.142 --> 01:23:28.244]  I mean, when I saw that, that my taxes actually went up, but for working class and middle class it went down, it made me love Trump even more.
[01:23:28.244 --> 01:23:32.425]  He actually, it's, it's, it's, it's, the ultra-rich should be paying more tax.
[01:23:32.425 --> 01:23:34.106]  He's like the real Bernie Sanders.
[01:23:34.106 --> 01:23:34.826]  It's incredible.
[01:23:36.181 --> 01:23:37.602]  No, and this has some precedent.
[01:23:37.602 --> 01:23:45.226]  You know, when he thought about running for president in 2000, he put forward a proposal in which the mega-rich would pay more.
[01:23:45.226 --> 01:23:46.446]  This included himself.
[01:23:46.446 --> 01:23:52.069]  He knew that he would be taxing himself greater, but he wanted to erase the deficit to make America stronger.
[01:23:52.069 --> 01:23:55.331]  That's the kind of selfless patriot Donald Trump is.
[01:23:55.331 --> 01:23:58.372]  So yes, he will pay more under this plan.
[01:23:58.372 --> 01:24:00.553]  You and I will pay more.
[01:24:00.553 --> 01:24:05.576]  But the vast majority of working Americans who voted for Donald Trump are going to get a tax cut.
[01:24:06.236 --> 01:24:10.681]  And the people can dispose of their own money better than the government can.
[01:24:10.681 --> 01:24:11.522]  You know it's sick!
[01:24:11.522 --> 01:24:18.329]  It's suddenly I want to pay my taxes and I never have because suddenly I feel like it's finally for America at least in the idea.
[01:24:19.997 --> 01:24:32.786]  Well, look, I follow the writings of economists like Larry Kudlow and Steve Moore of the Heritage Foundation, and they've been beating this drum all the way back to the Trump campaign.
[01:24:32.786 --> 01:24:40.832]  Donald Trump had from the beginning the most dynamic, the most pro-growth tax proposal of any candidate, Republican or Democrat,
[01:24:41.480 --> 01:24:50.045]  And now, lo and behold, despite the fact that some in the Congress have added some Christmas tree provisions, he's making it happen.
[01:24:50.045 --> 01:24:57.070]  This is going to be the greatest economic boom in American history, and it's going to turbocharge our economy.
[01:24:57.768 --> 01:25:17.200]  Which is going to make removing him even harder, but that will not, in any way, dampen the attempt by the Deep State and the two-party duopoly, the elites of both the Republican and Democratic Party, who still, despite the President's incredible success, want this President gone.
[01:25:17.200 --> 01:25:19.461]  And let's be clear, then, I'm going to give the big news.
[01:25:19.461 --> 01:25:26.346]  If you look at the geniuses, within the next two years, analysts agree, it's going to put pressure on the blue states that
[01:25:27.276 --> 01:25:33.617]  Write off their income tax at super high and write off their property tax at super high that then balloons it because it's written off.
[01:25:33.617 --> 01:25:35.617]  It makes people launder money through it.
[01:25:35.617 --> 01:25:37.678]  Then no money goes to the central government.
[01:25:37.678 --> 01:25:41.838]  Then the money only goes to rich globalists in those states that are writing it off.
[01:25:41.838 --> 01:25:49.440]  This actually makes them pay taxes, but it'll put pressure for the states now and the cities that do this to lower taxes to reasonable levels.
[01:25:49.440 --> 01:25:50.840]  I mean, you look at the genius.
[01:25:50.840 --> 01:25:55.801]  It's like, I think I'm pretty smart, Roger, but I read this in Aftermath now and I go, man,
[01:25:57.381 --> 01:26:02.484]  As bad as some of his advisors are, whatever's happening, some good stuff's going on, Roger.
[01:26:02.484 --> 01:26:07.025]  Well, what the president said in that New York Times interview a couple days ago is absolutely right.
[01:26:07.025 --> 01:26:10.227]  He understands tax policy better than the economists.
[01:26:10.227 --> 01:26:12.808]  Alex, let's move to the news, because I think it's important.
[01:26:12.808 --> 01:26:15.209]  I'm going to the next segment, too, because Caputo's coming up.
[01:26:15.209 --> 01:26:16.529]  Yeah, let's get in.
[01:26:16.529 --> 01:26:18.170]  Give us a taste of what's coming up.
[01:26:18.170 --> 01:26:18.951]  The good, the bad, the young.
[01:26:18.951 --> 01:26:20.251]  Because there's some bad news, too.
[01:26:20.251 --> 01:26:22.412]  We've got some big news on who's going to be leaving.
[01:26:22.412 --> 01:26:24.513]  Let's do the 25th Amendment right now, though.
[01:26:25.373 --> 01:26:41.142]  Well, first let's go to a question you asked me yesterday, because at least three senior administration sources told me, and I reported here at InfoWars, that Secretary of State Tillerson was leaving around January 1st.
[01:26:41.142 --> 01:26:51.048]  Now, suddenly, after a private meeting with General Mattis and General Kelly, well, it appears that Mr. Tillerson is staying, at least for the time being.
[01:26:51.852 --> 01:26:57.216]  I don't know what reason the generals gave the president, but I know what their game plan is.
[01:26:57.216 --> 01:27:01.499]  They need Tillerson's vote for their 25th Amendment takedown.
[01:27:01.499 --> 01:27:03.401]  They are head-counting.
[01:27:03.401 --> 01:27:08.205]  Anybody who thinks that Mike Pence isn't planning to move into the big office is wrong.
[01:27:08.205 --> 01:27:21.375]  His top aide, Nick Ayers, was caught leaking detrimental information about the president, and rather than fire Ayers, his press secretary, Mark Lauder, an exceptionally able young man, took the fall for him.
[01:27:21.975 --> 01:27:25.619]  So there are people staying and there are people leaving.
[01:27:25.619 --> 01:27:29.202]  We will get back into it in the next segment, as you say.
[01:27:29.202 --> 01:27:31.845]  But I stand by my prediction.
[01:27:31.845 --> 01:27:36.390]  Tillerson will stay around long enough to be of use to the deep state.
[01:27:36.390 --> 01:27:38.472]  Let's not forget where Tillerson came from.
[01:27:39.553 --> 01:27:47.062]  Exactly.
[01:27:47.062 --> 01:27:50.426]  I'm just frothing about how good things are, but you're right.
[01:27:50.426 --> 01:27:57.135]  I mean, it's just like McCabe, the architect of the fake Russiagate investigation, is the deputy director, advised the president
[01:27:57.475 --> 01:27:59.416]  Well, I think he's often, Alex, not told all the facts.
[01:27:59.416 --> 01:28:01.337]  In other words, they say, Mr. President, this is John Smith.
[01:28:19.289 --> 01:28:21.550]  He had excellent grades in college.
[01:28:21.550 --> 01:28:23.571]  He's been endorsed by five Republican U.S.
[01:28:23.571 --> 01:28:24.711]  Senators that you like.
[01:28:24.711 --> 01:28:26.572]  He'd be perfect for this job.
[01:28:26.572 --> 01:28:34.256]  No one says, and oh, by the way, he's a member of the Trilateral Commission and the Council on Foreign Relations, and he worked in the George W. Bush White House.
[01:28:34.256 --> 01:28:37.777]  So I think they lied to the President by omission.
[01:28:37.777 --> 01:28:39.518]  And he's not a political animal.
[01:28:39.518 --> 01:28:40.719]  He's a businessman.
[01:28:40.719 --> 01:28:42.239]  He's a visionary.
[01:28:42.239 --> 01:28:43.200]  He's a straight shooter.
[01:28:43.860 --> 01:28:53.413]  We'll be back then on the 25th Amendment plan and who's going to be leaving the administration next, who they plan to replace it with, exclusives with Roger Stone and Michael Caputo.
[01:28:53.413 --> 01:28:54.074]  Straight ahead.
[01:28:54.074 --> 01:28:54.555]  Stay with us.
[01:28:56.212 --> 01:28:56.713]  Not a group.
[01:28:56.713 --> 01:28:58.174]  You developed Living Defense for us.
[01:28:58.174 --> 01:28:59.495]  It took you over a year to do it.
[01:28:59.495 --> 01:29:00.696]  Why is this so good?
[01:29:00.696 --> 01:29:05.981]  Because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most.
[01:29:05.981 --> 01:29:19.534]  I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in my system, but right now we're dealing with massive parasites, which is anything that's harmful to your body that lives off a host mechanism.
[01:29:19.534 --> 01:29:20.895]  Right now with all the refugees,
[01:29:21.676 --> 01:29:23.318]  Uh, spreading disease around.
[01:29:23.318 --> 01:29:25.881]  We have biological warfare going on everywhere.
[01:29:25.881 --> 01:29:27.183]  These are all parasites.
[01:29:27.183 --> 01:29:28.304]  Tell us about all the stuff that's in it.
[01:29:28.304 --> 01:29:29.626]  There's so many things that are in it.
[01:29:29.626 --> 01:29:34.151]  You have the neem in there, you have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood.
[01:29:34.151 --> 01:29:37.295]  I recommend doing a parasite cleanse at least twice a year.
[01:29:37.355 --> 01:29:40.456]  All right, well, I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today.
[01:29:40.456 --> 01:29:41.517]  It just came back in yesterday.

[01:33:29.633 --> 01:33:32.714]  Riders on the storm!
[01:33:32.714 --> 01:33:35.794]  You know, they call me a schmuck.
[01:33:35.794 --> 01:33:37.415]  Psychopath, sociopath, dude.
[01:33:37.415 --> 01:33:40.575]  They think I'm a dummy because I don't want to screw people over.
[01:33:40.575 --> 01:33:42.156]  I'm a softy.
[01:33:42.156 --> 01:33:42.936]  I really care about...
[01:33:44.366 --> 01:33:45.086]  People.
[01:33:45.086 --> 01:33:47.688]  I care about doing what I say I'm gonna do.
[01:33:47.688 --> 01:33:51.910]  I also like to beat the brains out of my enemies, politically and physically if need be.
[01:33:51.910 --> 01:33:55.612]  I'm not saying I'm a tough guy, but I'm ready to fight.
[01:33:55.612 --> 01:34:00.094]  And I gotta tell you, I feel so satisfied, so satiated.
[01:34:00.094 --> 01:34:02.396]  I feel so empowered.
[01:34:02.396 --> 01:34:06.138]  I feel so good about pushing Trump and going with my gut.
[01:34:07.213 --> 01:34:11.256]  And everything that's happened in the last 11 months and 10 days, it's amazing.
[01:34:11.256 --> 01:34:18.381]  Michael Caputo, former senior advisor to the Trump campaign, head of the New York campaign as well, politics at NewYork.net.
[01:34:18.381 --> 01:34:20.142]  He's been accused of being a Russian agent.
[01:34:20.142 --> 01:34:22.183]  That whole narrative is falling apart spectacularly.
[01:34:22.183 --> 01:34:26.827]  We'll get his take in a moment on what he sees happening in the new year and just where we're at politically.
[01:34:26.827 --> 01:34:30.409]  But wow, I just feel like if I'm not gushing, I'm not being honest.
[01:34:30.409 --> 01:34:31.250]  And I'm always just honest.
[01:34:31.850 --> 01:34:35.175]  But Roger Stone, there are some poison linings to this.
[01:34:35.175 --> 01:34:41.945]  Give us the intrigue, you've been trying to get to, but I wanted to hold it until now, about the big resignation you learned about from a little birdie.
[01:34:41.945 --> 01:34:46.772]  Big exclusive, the media all pays attention to your exclusives because they're 99% of the time accurate.
[01:34:47.273 --> 01:34:52.477]  You're big exclusive, and then the next big shoot of drops, and the sixth.
[01:34:52.477 --> 01:34:56.740]  What should be, what should, we shouldn't be too arrogant, as the wolf says in Pulp Fiction.
[01:34:56.740 --> 01:34:59.382]  We shouldn't start, you know what, each other yet.
[01:34:59.382 --> 01:35:00.663]  What should we be watching for?
[01:35:00.663 --> 01:35:03.885]  Roger Stone will co-host here with Michael Caputo, here in just a minute.
[01:35:05.185 --> 01:35:07.667]  Well Alex, I think you're absolutely right.
[01:35:07.667 --> 01:35:23.921]  We should not just assume because the president is having these extraordinary successes that it in any way dampens the resolve of the deep state or tamps down the deep enmity they have for both the president culturally or
[01:35:24.441 --> 01:35:38.446]  His policies, which are nationalist, which are pro-American sovereignty, which are pro-American exceptionalism, which are a tip of the hat to Americana and the greatness of this country.
[01:35:38.446 --> 01:35:40.087]  They've had their way for 30 years.
[01:35:41.354 --> 01:35:47.660]  They have no intention of relinquishing the steering wheel to Donald Trump this easily.
[01:35:47.660 --> 01:35:54.567]  They're still shocked that he pulled off his most improbable victory in the last election against all odds.
[01:35:55.710 --> 01:36:18.224]  General John Kelly, whose own personal politics are progressive left, and who has sought to put a cocoon around the president, cutting him off from his natural allies in the conservative and liberty movement, is telling intimates that he himself will leave within three to four months.
[01:36:19.231 --> 01:36:32.706]  And I think this is the key, and the President's new Chief of Staff would be Rob Porter of Ohio, the Bush, Quisling, the U.S.
[01:36:32.706 --> 01:36:38.332]  Senator, member of the Trilateral Commission, and the Council on Foreign Relations.
[01:36:39.036 --> 01:36:47.424]  Now, I bring this up now, and I know that some out there will say, oh, this is a conspiracy theory.
[01:36:47.424 --> 01:36:49.086]  Let us just see.
[01:36:49.086 --> 01:36:54.872]  I think it's vital that the president know who exactly who Rob Porter is.
[01:36:54.872 --> 01:37:00.838]  And when they say the president, do they necessarily mean Donald Trump?
[01:37:01.819 --> 01:37:19.107]  Mark my words, Alex, despite the fact that we're high-fiving each other right now and that the president is in an exceptionally good mood, having had a great year, this is going to come on fast and furious and it will be vicious.
[01:37:19.107 --> 01:37:22.889]  You're going to see an uptake in the Trump is crazy talk.
[01:37:23.504 --> 01:37:25.767]  You heard it here on InfoWars first.
[01:37:25.767 --> 01:37:27.268]  I said it months ago.
[01:37:27.268 --> 01:37:30.952]  When the Russian collusion, delusion collapses.
[01:37:30.952 --> 01:37:33.515]  When they are proven to be completely empty handed.
[01:37:33.515 --> 01:37:34.276]  You said it in March.
[01:37:34.276 --> 01:37:35.077]  You said it in March.
[01:37:35.077 --> 01:37:37.419]  You said it when you had the sources.
[01:37:37.419 --> 01:37:42.585]  And that's where I want to go next with you and Michael Caputo, politicsny.net.
[01:37:43.826 --> 01:37:55.032]  Is that, why is the New York Times, Michael Caputo, why is all these publications saying, okay, Russiagate's fake, the FBI's in trouble, we admit it's a fraud, let's just leave it alone.
[01:37:55.032 --> 01:37:58.795]  Why are they signaling that all over the place the last four or five days?
[01:37:58.795 --> 01:38:02.637]  Michael Caputo, what do you make of that, being a former top Trump advisor?
[01:38:02.637 --> 01:38:11.862]  And then other big issues, you're the expert here, what other information do you want to impart to the listeners about where we are right now in this war to retake America from the globalists?
[01:38:13.075 --> 01:38:13.616]  It's interesting.
[01:38:13.616 --> 01:38:16.659]  I think, frankly, that it was always going to end this way.
[01:38:16.659 --> 01:38:21.904]  The Russia-Trump collusion, delusion was always going to come apart.
[01:38:21.904 --> 01:38:30.873]  And I think that, you know, the left is probably high-fiving themselves that they were able to keep that ball in the air as long as they were able to.
[01:38:30.873 --> 01:38:32.675]  You know, frankly, this has all been about
[01:38:33.734 --> 01:38:35.455]  A very important agenda on the left.
[01:38:35.455 --> 01:38:44.921]  That is, they're going to destroy Donald Trump, they're going to destroy his family, they're going to destroy his businesses, and they're going to destroy his friends.
[01:38:44.921 --> 01:38:54.166]  Because, God forbid, in 10 years or 15 years, another American-minded billionaire comes forward and says, honey, I can fix this.
[01:38:54.166 --> 01:38:56.567]  I think I need to run for president.
[01:38:56.567 --> 01:38:58.749]  They want that person to have a second thought.
[01:38:58.749 --> 01:39:02.851]  Look what they did to Trump and his family and his businesses and his friends.
[01:39:03.411 --> 01:39:08.673]  And I think they've taken this Russia collusion delusion as far down the track as they could.
[01:39:08.673 --> 01:39:25.139]  You know, Alex, when I was working with the President during the campaign, there was a point when I, there was a signal to me, I thought, that the Hillary side of the campaign had cracked the code, had figured out how to get Donald Trump.
[01:39:25.139 --> 01:39:26.620]  And that was to insult him.
[01:39:27.327 --> 01:39:38.770]  To insult his family or to insult his businesses in an unreasonable and unseemly way, have that advanced by the media and he would get angry and make mistakes.
[01:39:38.770 --> 01:39:45.071]  We saw that time and again tried on him during the campaign and occasionally it succeeded.
[01:39:45.071 --> 01:39:51.213]  What they've done here is, as we saw in the book Shattered, which was written about the time after the election,
[01:39:51.733 --> 01:40:08.028]  The Clinton team decided that they were going to have this Russia collusion delusion as their front line, as their first story, and try to put the president in a situation where he would mess up and in this circumstance perhaps commit obstruction.
[01:40:08.028 --> 01:40:12.192]  And I think they're satisfied that they've moved the ball so far as they have.
[01:40:14.261 --> 01:40:18.044]  What do you make of them then suddenly coming out and saying, okay, it's a fraud, okay?
[01:40:18.044 --> 01:40:29.553]  I mean, is that just them hedging their bets because they realize the public isn't buying into it because now all these documents have come out and the admissions of like 26 people in the FBI Justice Department colluding to make all this up?
[01:40:30.638 --> 01:40:31.539]  It's interesting, Alex.
[01:40:31.539 --> 01:40:33.220]  I'd love to hear what Roger has to say.
[01:40:33.220 --> 01:40:56.734]  I haven't had a chance to talk to him about this, but the big blockbuster Nothingburger in the New York Times about Papadopoulos that came out this weekend, I can't quite figure out, trying to read the tea leaves, why they would break this story on New Year's Eve weekend, which I believe is perhaps the worst weekend of the year to break news.
[01:40:56.734 --> 01:40:58.415]  I wonder what Roger thinks about that.
[01:40:59.344 --> 01:41:00.725]  Let me take a shot at this.
[01:41:00.725 --> 01:41:03.507]  Here's the thing I think it's important to understand.
[01:41:03.507 --> 01:41:17.556]  The globalists always have a plan A and a plan B and a plan C. Plan A has been a limited success in the sense that they have tied the president up for over a year over nothing.
[01:41:18.451 --> 01:41:31.518]  And sadly, a substantial number of Americans, thank God a minority, still believe that the Kremlin somehow tried to help Donald Trump get elected, despite the fact that they've turned up no evidence whatsoever.
[01:41:31.518 --> 01:41:33.199]  Or that all three of us work for the Kremlin.
[01:41:34.493 --> 01:41:38.075]  And they have taken, they accused us of being Russian agents.
[01:41:38.075 --> 01:41:45.859]  They accused InfoWars of using Russian bots to post our links.
[01:41:45.859 --> 01:41:47.319]  Complete nonsense.
[01:41:47.319 --> 01:41:52.262]  They take a completely innocent and totally legal meeting by Donald Trump Jr.
[01:41:52.262 --> 01:41:57.985]  and they try to make it a criminal conspiracy or at a minimum a campaign finance violation.
[01:41:57.985 --> 01:41:58.605]  It is neither.
[01:41:59.105 --> 01:42:02.626]  But they are abandoning Plan A. It's over.
[01:42:02.626 --> 01:42:09.328]  We're now moving to Plan B. Plan B is a removal under the 25th Amendment.
[01:42:09.328 --> 01:42:14.089]  A bogus claim... And as you said, Kelly and others, everybody wants to lionize him.
[01:42:14.089 --> 01:42:15.450]  You think, from your sources,
[01:42:15.970 --> 01:42:18.353]  Let me ask Caputo that we come back.
[01:42:18.353 --> 01:42:20.275]  What about the 25th Amendment?
[01:42:20.275 --> 01:42:22.017]  I mean, how can they get rid of the president now?
[01:42:22.017 --> 01:42:24.621]  More rapegate, you know, made-up stuff.
[01:42:24.621 --> 01:42:26.163]  We'll talk about it all.
[01:42:26.163 --> 01:42:30.248]  Michael Caputo, former senior advisor to Trump during the campaign.
[01:42:30.248 --> 01:42:30.988]  Politics.
[01:42:30.988 --> 01:42:31.629]  NewYork.net.
[01:42:32.490 --> 01:42:35.191]  Mike in Arizona, you're on the air worldwide.
[01:42:35.191 --> 01:42:35.791]  Go ahead.
[01:42:59.262 --> 01:43:01.185]  Oh, Alex, you can rant any day of the week.
[01:43:01.185 --> 01:43:11.719]  Thank you, sir, for doing what you do and being a patriot and doing your best to save America and encouraging us as fellow patriots to do that in our local areas as well.
[01:43:11.719 --> 01:43:15.084]  And as a longtime InfoWars listener, I want to say thanks.
[01:43:15.524 --> 01:43:15.784]  Absolutely.
[01:43:38.291 --> 01:43:51.213]  Because then we could all, as educated patriots, help our other countrymen and women understand that there's bigger problems going on, and if we can get our houses in order and be good to each other and ourselves, we can take our country back.
[01:43:56.161 --> 01:44:02.023]  2017 has been a earth-shaking year.

[01:44:05.204 --> 01:44:09.985]  In fact, my good friend Stefan Molyneux said it's gonna be like the Battle of the Gods, Ragnarok.
[01:44:09.985 --> 01:44:12.005]  So get ready, ladies and gentlemen.

[01:47:04.395 --> 01:47:05.295]  Don't tread on me!
[01:47:05.295 --> 01:47:13.398]  I gotta tell ya, this is an amazing final broadcast of 2017 and
[01:47:32.437 --> 01:47:40.520]  We're so accustomed to evil and corruption, to just see a president that's not out to get us and is actually trying to turn the country back on and trying to be fair is amazing.
[01:47:40.520 --> 01:47:47.642]  So I really asked Michael Caputo, former top Trump advisor, and of course Roger Stone, former head of his campaign, to just take over this final segment.
[01:47:47.642 --> 01:47:51.843]  Because if they pause, I'll run rampant here and just give us other tidbits.
[01:47:51.843 --> 01:47:54.003]  And I said, Caputo and Stone, what are you talking about?
[01:47:54.003 --> 01:47:55.464]  And he said, well, what's next?
[01:47:56.687 --> 01:47:57.908]  Alright, well I'm happy to dive in.
[01:47:57.908 --> 01:48:01.650]  Look, I think Mueller has had as bad a month of December as the President had good.
[01:48:24.392 --> 01:48:29.815]  His entire probe is exposed as the partisan witch hunt that it is.
[01:48:29.815 --> 01:48:34.898]  His hit squad is exposed as exactly that.
[01:48:34.898 --> 01:48:46.524]  And now the only way that he can regain the upper hand is through the guilty play of General Mike Flynn, who I believe is a great, great patriot.
[01:48:47.433 --> 01:48:50.334]  Flynn has been jammed up in a process crime.
[01:48:50.334 --> 01:48:55.555]  There's nothing illegal or improper regarding his outreach to the Russians to set up a meeting.
[01:48:55.555 --> 01:49:00.797]  In case you haven't been paying attention, folks, the Russians have thermonuclear weapons.
[01:49:00.797 --> 01:49:04.938]  Not speaking to them would be very, very dangerous.
[01:49:04.938 --> 01:49:15.821]  But we do know that Flynn has said publicly that a senior member of the president's transition team instructed him to reach out to the Russian ambassador.
[01:49:16.531 --> 01:49:19.115]  That can only be Mr. Kushner.
[01:49:19.115 --> 01:49:29.991]  Let me stress again, even if Jared Kushner did do that, that's a perfectly appropriate legal function of the transition and a counselor to the President.
[01:49:30.655 --> 01:49:35.779]  Yet we know that the FBI has grilled Kushner for hours.
[01:49:35.779 --> 01:49:50.010]  And therefore, the question becomes, do they try to jam him up with some kind of process crime, like they did with Flynn, in an attempt to inflame the president and induce the president to fire Mueller?
[01:49:50.690 --> 01:49:54.873]  Or, perhaps, to pardon both Kushner and Flynn.
[01:49:54.873 --> 01:49:56.835]  Well, clearly that was their admitted plan.
[01:49:56.835 --> 01:49:59.717]  They've telegraphed it with all their talking points on CNN.
[01:49:59.717 --> 01:50:07.082]  But now, Michael Caputo, it seems to be blowing up as it's... I mean, even mainstream publications admit it's all a frame-up of Trump.
[01:50:07.082 --> 01:50:09.884]  I mean, are they crazy enough to go forward with this?
[01:50:09.884 --> 01:50:10.525]  What comes next?
[01:50:11.257 --> 01:50:13.200]  Well, I think it's interesting.
[01:50:13.200 --> 01:50:15.803]  I don't just count the tea leaves that are there.
[01:50:15.803 --> 01:50:17.626]  I look for the ones that aren't there.
[01:50:17.626 --> 01:50:18.747]  And you know what's not there?
[01:50:18.747 --> 01:50:27.379]  After all these stories about what Flynn did and what the coffee boy Papadopoulos did, we've seen very little about Jared Kushner.
[01:50:28.101 --> 01:50:36.069]  And the question, you know, we also see that Kushner and his legal team were out shopping for a public relations firm.
[01:50:36.069 --> 01:50:43.176]  So it appears they are looking, you know, forward into 2018 and seeing a more serious fight on their hands as well.
[01:50:43.176 --> 01:50:44.737]  So the lack... Oh, absolutely.
[01:50:44.737 --> 01:50:46.259]  They plan to indict Kushner next.
[01:50:46.259 --> 01:50:48.841]  I don't think they got the huevos to do it to Donald Jr.
[01:50:48.841 --> 01:50:50.263]  So yeah, keep going.
[01:50:51.280 --> 01:50:58.463]  Yeah, I just think the lack of news on Kushner shows to me that he's probably, his time in the barrel is coming in this new year.
[01:50:58.463 --> 01:51:02.125]  And that's unfortunate, but you know, he appears to be their new target.
[01:51:02.125 --> 01:51:12.189]  We also see in this New York Times story, as many errors as I saw in it, we also see that Papadopoulos was somebody who was running absolutely amok.
[01:51:12.888 --> 01:51:13.088]  I'm sorry.
[01:51:28.278 --> 01:51:30.861]  Uh, to the President, or that he actually connected.
[01:51:30.861 --> 01:51:34.304]  Well, yeah, he's like this low-level guy that keeps going, let's meet with the Russians.
[01:51:34.304 --> 01:51:36.766]  We're like, shut up, Russians, they don't matter.
[01:51:36.766 --> 01:51:40.729]  It's like hundreds of times, he was obvious, it looks to me like he was a plant from the beginning.
[01:51:40.729 --> 01:51:45.133]  I mean, you read those transcripts, does it not look like he's a plant from the beginning?
[01:51:45.133 --> 01:51:45.453]  It does.
[01:51:46.954 --> 01:51:48.615]  Or he's just, or he's just stupid.
[01:51:48.615 --> 01:51:49.976]  Let's be clear.
[01:51:49.976 --> 01:51:51.636]  He's a volunteer.
[01:51:51.636 --> 01:51:53.357]  He has no authority.
[01:51:53.357 --> 01:51:54.978]  He's not on the payroll.
[01:51:54.978 --> 01:51:56.439]  He doesn't have a passport.
[01:51:56.439 --> 01:51:57.759]  Sure, but he's like a wind-up doll.
[01:51:57.759 --> 01:51:59.780]  He just goes, meet with the Russians, meet with the Russians.
[01:51:59.780 --> 01:52:01.961]  And they're like, shut up, kid.
[01:52:01.961 --> 01:52:04.743]  Russians aren't... I mean, it's like there's nothing there.
[01:52:05.760 --> 01:52:20.274]  Some of the interesting parts of the story were that it was very clear from the New York Times story that everybody in the campaign thought this guy was stupid, that he was foolishly enthusiastic, and that he had terrible ideas.
[01:52:20.274 --> 01:52:22.476]  And it comes through in the story as well.
[01:52:22.476 --> 01:52:24.398]  I think they also in that story said,
[01:52:25.018 --> 01:52:38.966]  That Sessions, I believe it was, wanted to move away from his ideas because there was no way if they were ever going to meet with the Russians that they would do so through the auspices of a young and inexperienced person like Papadopoulos.
[01:52:38.966 --> 01:52:40.086]  Well, exactly!
[01:52:40.086 --> 01:52:43.228]  That's the meetings I'm saying where Sessions is like, Russians?
[01:52:43.228 --> 01:52:47.831]  It's like talking about, you know, just random crap.
[01:52:48.621 --> 01:52:50.103]  But let's play it out here.
[01:52:50.103 --> 01:53:00.518]  See, what they would like to have happen is the president, first of all, it's not inconsistent because the indictment of Kushner would be not related to Russian collusion.
[01:53:00.518 --> 01:53:02.761]  It would be related to lying to the FBI.
[01:53:03.832 --> 01:53:08.793]  Then, they hope that the President will overreact and fire Mueller.
[01:53:08.793 --> 01:53:11.534]  This is their briar patch strategy.
[01:53:11.534 --> 01:53:12.915]  They are so naked.
[01:53:12.915 --> 01:53:14.095]  Please throw it out.
[01:53:14.095 --> 01:53:22.977]  Congresswoman Jackie Speier, rhymes with liar, running around saying, oh the rumors everywhere, Trump is going to fire Mueller.
[01:53:22.977 --> 01:53:24.598]  They want him to fire Mueller.
[01:53:24.598 --> 01:53:28.219]  So let me ask you both, let me ask, let me ask Michael Caputo here as we end this year's transmissions.
[01:53:29.258 --> 01:53:31.020]  Clearly it's falling apart.
[01:53:31.020 --> 01:53:34.263]  How do they extricate themselves with face shaving?
[01:53:34.263 --> 01:53:39.628]  Or is all this face shaving a ploy for what they're really about to do with Russiagate?
[01:53:39.628 --> 01:53:40.609]  Is it dead?
[01:53:40.609 --> 01:53:41.650]  Or does it still have legs?
[01:53:41.650 --> 01:53:42.211]  Mylon Caputo.
[01:53:43.013 --> 01:53:49.575]  I think that the House and Senate investigations, the multiple investigations over in Congress there, are going to wind down.
[01:53:49.575 --> 01:54:00.057]  You'll see Representative Smear and Representative Schiff spending a lot of time screaming about it to the press because they've gotten a free ride in the media for quite some time.
[01:54:00.057 --> 01:54:06.199]  I believe we'll see Mueller's investigation wind down necessarily, too, with maybe even some more processed crimes.
[01:54:06.679 --> 01:54:07.019]  I think?
[01:54:33.462 --> 01:54:34.644]  I totally agree.
[01:54:34.644 --> 01:54:39.129]  But, you know, they never give up, even though they're getting their ass kicked, politically, you name it.
[01:54:39.129 --> 01:54:44.136]  If America doesn't roll over like Bernie Sanders did when they stole the nomination, when Hillary did, we're going to win.
[01:54:44.136 --> 01:54:46.619]  But if we roll over, that's the bottom line.
[01:54:46.619 --> 01:54:52.346]  You know, I had the crew run out to the local grocery store to get a bottle of champagne here at the end because I didn't
[01:54:52.346 --> 01:54:52.766]  We're good to go.
[01:55:09.091 --> 01:55:11.772]  One inch, you know what, long people that hate everybody.
[01:55:11.772 --> 01:55:13.053]  So Happy New Year to everybody.
[01:55:13.053 --> 01:55:16.034]  I want to give you both a one-minute comment here at the end.
[01:55:16.034 --> 01:55:18.236]  But to my crew and all of you in the listeners, I love you.
[01:55:18.236 --> 01:55:22.998]  And I am so proud to be associated with people that are pro-freedom and pro-America.
[01:55:22.998 --> 01:55:28.841]  So to all of you, to Mr. Caputo and Mr. Stone and the great crew here, God bless you gentlemen.
[01:55:28.841 --> 01:55:32.683]  Each of you, Mr. Caputo first, a one-minute final comment here as we go into 2018.
[01:55:34.815 --> 01:55:38.238]  Well, 2017 has been hell for a lot of people.
[01:55:38.238 --> 01:55:42.322]  It's been difficult in a lot of ways, but we sure came out of it strong.
[01:55:42.322 --> 01:55:48.167]  I've always known Donald Trump to finish strong when he's in the midst of a difficult business battle.
[01:55:48.167 --> 01:55:51.951]  And he ended 2017, I think, with one for the record books.
[01:55:51.951 --> 01:55:52.752]  With what he did,
[01:55:53.232 --> 01:56:05.161]  With regulations, cutting 900 plus regulations, installing Gorsuch and a dozen appeals court justices, he's achieved more in one year than many presidents have in their first year.
[01:56:05.161 --> 01:56:13.247]  And he comes out of it, depending upon what poll you believe, with just about the same poll rating that Barack Obama did in his first year.
[01:56:13.767 --> 01:56:19.331]  That doesn't sound great to me though because in my book 2018 is going to be a big challenge.
[01:56:19.331 --> 01:56:20.692]  We can get there.
[01:56:20.692 --> 01:56:28.937]  The campaign geniuses in Washington have to come to terms with some unfortunate facts about what they can't do and they should never do.
[01:56:29.697 --> 01:56:41.103]  Is, let's say, abandon and kick out of the party the Bannons, the Breitbarts, the Infowars, the Fox News, the grassroots, the people who elected Donald Trump.
[01:56:41.103 --> 01:56:41.583]  Exactly.
[01:56:41.583 --> 01:56:44.184]  We've got a huge year ahead of us.
[01:56:44.184 --> 01:56:46.105]  If we go to sleep, the globalists could win.
[01:56:46.105 --> 01:56:47.626]  If we stay awake, we win.
[01:56:47.626 --> 01:56:52.488]  Roger Stone, let's both here toast to you and the audience, everybody.
[01:56:52.488 --> 01:56:53.068]  I salute you.
[01:56:53.068 --> 01:56:54.709]  We've got 30 seconds left.
[01:56:54.709 --> 01:56:55.750]  Final comment going into 2018.
[01:56:57.270 --> 01:57:06.595]  Well, Alex, look, I want to salute you because you had the courage and the foresight to be for Donald Trump when people like Glenn Beck were saying, oh, he's a disaster.
[01:57:06.595 --> 01:57:07.936]  He's a sure loser.
[01:57:07.936 --> 01:57:09.217]  And you never wavered.
[01:57:09.818 --> 01:57:14.082]  Well, I remember talking to you the day the NBC Billy Bush tape dropped.
[01:57:14.082 --> 01:57:15.543]  You never wavered.
[01:57:15.543 --> 01:57:18.807]  You said, we're going to get over this, we're going to win this thing.
[01:57:18.807 --> 01:57:20.128]  And you were right.
[01:57:20.128 --> 01:57:26.334]  Watch the president regain the initiative, coming up soon, when he fires Rod Rosenstein.
[01:57:26.334 --> 01:57:28.716]  That's my prediction for 2018.
[01:57:28.716 --> 01:57:32.940]  To Americana, to freedom, to you my friend, to the audience, God bless you, to the crew.
[01:57:32.940 --> 01:57:33.941]  Thank you.
[01:57:38.496 --> 01:57:39.697]  One year later, we delivered.
[01:57:39.697 --> 01:57:40.478]  You did it, folks.
[01:57:40.478 --> 01:57:41.058]  We did it together.
[01:57:41.058 --> 01:57:41.518]  Thank God.
[01:57:41.518 --> 01:57:42.059]  Thank Jesus.
[01:57:42.059 --> 01:57:43.500]  We did it.
[01:57:43.500 --> 01:57:46.582]  Happy New Year, folks.
