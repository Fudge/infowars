[00:36.160 --> 00:48.360]  transmission of info wars in 2017 as we plunge forward into 2018 2017 was a
[00:48.360 --> 00:51.040]  major year of revolution against globalists around the world it was a
[00:51.040 --> 00:55.700]  major year of incredible betrayals we learned about from the mega banks and
[00:55.700 --> 01:01.260]  the big cartels but also an incredible gear of delivery by populist and
[01:01.260 --> 01:09.460]  nationalist movements across the world truly amazing I hope the 2017 doesn't
[01:09.460 --> 01:13.180]  go out with a bang but if you look at drudgereport.com Houston hotel our
[01:13.180 --> 01:18.500]  central bust above New York's Eve celebration New Year's Eve celebration

[01:23.820 --> 01:27.440]  that's just some crazy person they weren't actually planning something
[01:27.440 --> 01:35.860]  Trump promises in 2018 to do much much more on regulations on other taxes on
[01:35.860 --> 01:39.940]  going after the welfare queens that have been domesticated by the globalist
[01:39.940 --> 01:44.100]  we're gonna look at what's coming up in the year ahead but first off ladies and

[02:09.260 --> 02:13.620]  hands serious I can feel the energy can't you 2018 is gonna be a doozy you
[02:13.620 --> 02:18.020]  think 2016 was big 2017 it just goes forward in the human singularity with
[02:18.020 --> 02:23.420]  technology human populations the good the bad the ugly I mean we are tied to a
[02:23.420 --> 02:27.500]  rocket ship ladies and gentlemen we're either going to Valhalla we're going on
[02:27.500 --> 02:34.020]  express elevator to hell so get ready but I could feel the energy wow mmm and
[02:34.020 --> 02:38.620]  it's good energy overall there's a little dark energy twisted over there on
[02:38.620 --> 02:43.860]  the dark side of the moon but other than that this is an amazing time right now
[02:43.860 --> 02:51.940]  Trump is right about the FBI that's the headline out of CNN they say the FBI is
[02:51.940 --> 02:55.820]  a political operation at the top run by the Clintons engaging in a major frame
[02:55.820 --> 03:01.380]  up of Trump that it's all a giant fraud and that it's destroying the FBI and
[03:01.380 --> 03:05.700]  governmental institutions and turbo charging Trump the only reason they're
[03:05.700 --> 03:09.700]  saying drop the Russian investigation now is because it blew up in their face
[03:09.700 --> 03:14.660]  as we told you months ago it already done and now it's even evident to them
[03:14.660 --> 03:19.980]  they tried to paper over it tried to not cover it on CNN MSNBC didn't work so now
[03:19.980 --> 03:25.260]  they are crapping their globalist pedophile britches and here it is out
[03:25.260 --> 03:30.980]  of the nation the so-called pinnacle of liberal socialist pinhead thinking
[03:30.980 --> 03:36.820]  Russia gate is devolving into an effort to stigmatize dissent no it was always
[03:36.820 --> 03:41.220]  an effort to stigmatize nationalist and free market dissent and attempt to
[03:41.220 --> 03:44.900]  overturn the election overturn all the other major elections of 2016 and
[03:44.900 --> 03:48.620]  bring in globalist federalized control after Trump was removed to never have
[03:48.620 --> 03:54.220]  another free election you failed at your effort to stigmatize dissent so now
[03:54.220 --> 04:02.380]  you're taking the high horse road because you've been caught but again it's
[04:02.380 --> 04:08.700]  everywhere it's beyond blood in the water it's sharks dining on the leftist
[04:08.700 --> 04:15.580]  lemmings and the control corporate press that took itself from dead to
[04:15.580 --> 04:19.620]  undead with all the globalist funding the last few years to now simply
[04:19.620 --> 04:28.820]  disappearing in a puff of ashes into the atmosphere and it's fitting to cap all
[04:28.820 --> 04:35.900]  that off that we now learn about one of the major Nigerian Prince scammers turns
[04:35.900 --> 04:41.540]  out he's a white guy from Louisiana but isn't that kind of a parable it's a
[04:41.540 --> 04:45.740]  known 20-year fraud millions have been stolen by it but they still keep using
[04:45.740 --> 04:49.940]  the fraud those people still keep buying it just like they keep voting for
[04:49.940 --> 04:54.420]  Obamacare or globalism or communism even though it's known nightmares we'll be
[04:54.420 --> 04:57.580]  back stay with us
[04:58.900 --> 05:04.740]  I'm so excited the new product in inforwarslife.com in a glass bottle two
[05:04.740 --> 05:09.940]  months servings filled to the brim filled to the absolute top the real red
[05:09.940 --> 05:15.780]  bill this is a heart and brain pill a new tropic that doesn't have any stimulants
[05:15.780 --> 05:21.180]  in it but boy does it stimulate because it's beyond that quite frankly I just
[05:21.180 --> 05:25.820]  went off what I saw medical doctors prescribing to their patients but it
[05:25.820 --> 05:28.820]  wasn't prescription but they were charging people a hundred two hundred
[05:28.820 --> 05:33.860]  dollars for the formulae and I came up with our own formula working with some
[05:33.860 --> 05:40.540]  scientists and developers non-gmo made right here in America 120 capsules and
[05:40.540 --> 05:44.540]  ladies and gentlemen you add the preglonone to it which is the precursor
[05:44.540 --> 05:48.820]  to all the hormones that your body has to have to even make the hormones in your
[05:48.820 --> 05:55.780]  glands it is amazing red pill now available at inforwarsstore.com and
[05:55.780 --> 06:07.340]  your purchase fuzz the operation
[06:07.340 --> 06:19.980]  Waging war on corruption it's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the infowars
[06:19.980 --> 06:23.980]  It has been a spectacular year.
[06:25.980 --> 06:34.980]  2017 was like a 110 year old man standing up on the precipice of the cliff
[06:35.980 --> 06:39.980]  with his beard so long and his teeth so long
[06:41.980 --> 06:47.980]  that he's about to jump off that cliff and turn to dust before he even begins to fall
[06:47.980 --> 06:50.980]  and then blow away in a whirlwind
[06:51.980 --> 06:55.980]  to be part of the foundation of 2018
[06:56.980 --> 07:02.980]  as like a bright-eyed child it comes toddling out into the future
[07:03.980 --> 07:08.980]  what an amazing time to be alive, a time of true renewal
[07:09.980 --> 07:12.980]  yes we face amazing challenges but
[07:12.980 --> 07:16.980]  Trump knows for every yin there's a yang
[07:17.980 --> 07:24.980]  and that parasitic behavior, globalism, a program of making people poor to control them
[07:25.980 --> 07:31.980]  feudalism, that been done for the entire history of recorded human animals
[07:32.980 --> 07:35.980]  but renaissance was only 460 something years old
[07:36.980 --> 07:38.980]  our republic only 244 years old
[07:38.980 --> 07:42.980]  the idea of empowering humanity, turning loose the lower classes
[07:43.980 --> 07:46.980]  and then finding the great genius that lied therein
[07:47.980 --> 07:53.980]  there's no doubt that even limited free market capitalism, who's never achieved full capitalism
[07:54.980 --> 07:59.980]  produces such innovation, such choice, such wealth, such dynamics
[08:00.980 --> 08:02.980]  that compared to communism
[08:02.980 --> 08:08.980]  it's like comparing a dumb inanimate rock to the mind of God
[08:09.980 --> 08:11.980]  but that is the mind of God
[08:12.980 --> 08:16.980]  free will, choice, but with that comes great responsibility
[08:17.980 --> 08:19.980]  because if you're given so much power
[08:20.980 --> 08:23.980]  will you become a narcissistic Luciferian
[08:24.980 --> 08:28.980]  will you decide to keep others from the Promethean fire which you have been given
[08:28.980 --> 08:31.980]  will you attempt to hoard the light to yourself
[08:33.980 --> 08:38.980]  falling in love like narcissists with his own reflection
[08:39.980 --> 08:41.980]  that way lies ruined
[08:43.980 --> 08:48.980]  but for those of us that seek the dark tower
[08:49.980 --> 08:54.980]  the quest to be honorable strong men and build up society and civilization
[08:54.980 --> 08:58.980]  this is a very, very special time to be alive ladies and gentlemen
[08:59.980 --> 09:05.980]  but it is like taking breath, taking a cup of wine before the real fight
[09:08.980 --> 09:10.980]  it is the breath before we're sucked under
[09:12.980 --> 09:14.980]  so take a deep breath and get ready
[09:15.980 --> 09:19.980]  because the final challenge in the next 35, 40 years
[09:20.980 --> 09:22.980]  on whether we will survive as a species
[09:22.980 --> 09:27.980]  or whether we will destroy ourselves in satanic delusions
[09:28.980 --> 09:29.980]  is now before us
[09:30.980 --> 09:32.980]  we are at the crossroads
[09:34.980 --> 09:39.980]  and my great sin, Donald Trump's great sin, many of yours great sin
[09:40.980 --> 09:44.980]  according to the globalist pedophile devil worshipers, the selfish ones
[09:45.980 --> 09:50.980]  is that we believe in humanity and are confident and want to build others up
[09:50.980 --> 09:55.980]  and so they play us knowing we have a conscience
[09:56.980 --> 09:58.980]  knowing we care to give up our own will and wealth
[09:59.980 --> 10:01.980]  to supposedly help the individual who is poor
[10:02.980 --> 10:05.980]  but it's really only through another combine to set them up as the master
[10:07.980 --> 10:11.980]  but Trump knows that if he can turn America and the world around
[10:12.980 --> 10:15.980]  at least financially and get us back to basic tenets we know
[10:15.980 --> 10:22.980]  are designed to work and do work versus collectivism, communism
[10:23.980 --> 10:25.980]  and all the dehumanization and mass murder that follows it
[10:26.980 --> 10:28.980]  if he can simply do that
[10:29.980 --> 10:33.980]  when they talk about Camelot and the Kennedys
[10:35.980 --> 10:37.980]  who are seriously Silver Spoon
[10:38.980 --> 10:39.980]  want to be elitist
[10:40.980 --> 10:42.980]  I mean I don't want to say bad people overall but give me a break
[10:42.980 --> 10:47.980]  that was just TV getting fancy and media learning how to dull people up
[10:48.980 --> 10:51.980]  and so it was like a tabloid presidency
[10:52.980 --> 10:55.980]  with Trump he's got the supermodel goddess
[10:59.980 --> 11:02.980]  beyond feminine powerful flamethrowing female
[11:04.980 --> 11:05.980]  the real energy, the real power
[11:06.980 --> 11:08.980]  now the most popular person in America according to Gallup
[11:09.980 --> 11:10.980]  everything is imploding in their face
[11:10.980 --> 11:11.980]  he's got that
[11:12.980 --> 11:15.980]  but what he's really delivering is the belief in the worker
[11:16.980 --> 11:17.980]  the belief in the family
[11:18.980 --> 11:19.980]  the belief in the individual and a chance
[11:20.980 --> 11:23.980]  to help you get the chip off your shoulder and move forward
[11:24.980 --> 11:27.980]  and that infuriates the vampires
[11:28.980 --> 11:31.980]  the spiritually hunchback devils
[11:32.980 --> 11:34.980]  who absolutely hate your will
[11:35.980 --> 11:36.980]  hate your strength
[11:37.980 --> 11:38.980]  hate your honor
[11:38.980 --> 11:40.980]  and hate your goodwill
[11:41.980 --> 11:43.980]  and they ravenously want to pull you down
[11:44.980 --> 11:45.980]  and want to destroy you
[11:46.980 --> 11:47.980]  and want to annihilate you
[11:48.980 --> 11:50.980]  because your very existence
[11:51.980 --> 11:52.980]  your good heart
[11:53.980 --> 11:54.980]  your love of God
[11:55.980 --> 11:57.980]  is like nails on a chalkboard to them spiritually
[11:58.980 --> 12:00.980]  and the only consciousness they have
[12:01.980 --> 12:02.980]  is to destroy you
[12:02.980 --> 12:07.980]  the only will they have is to annihilate you
[12:12.980 --> 12:16.980]  the world is in a rotting, corrupt, twisted,
[12:17.980 --> 12:21.980]  betrayed, withering depression right now
[12:23.980 --> 12:26.980]  and so as grandiose
[12:27.980 --> 12:29.980]  and quite frankly grotesque at times
[12:29.980 --> 12:32.980]  Trump is like the ghost of Christmas present
[12:33.980 --> 12:34.980]  it's what we need
[12:36.980 --> 12:38.980]  and it's the thing, the perfect thing
[12:39.980 --> 12:41.980]  to challenge the austerity
[12:42.980 --> 12:44.980]  and the poverty and the bondage
[12:45.980 --> 12:47.980]  and the backstabbing and the twistedness
[12:48.980 --> 12:49.980]  and the failure that is globalism
[12:50.980 --> 12:51.980]  and communism and collectivism
[12:52.980 --> 12:53.980]  and all of its systems of centralization
[12:53.980 --> 12:58.980]  and Trump knows that if he delivers
[13:01.980 --> 13:05.980]  the Trump dynasty will be unmatched
[13:06.980 --> 13:08.980]  the problem is the sons are good
[13:09.980 --> 13:10.980]  the daughters aren't bad
[13:11.980 --> 13:12.980]  they're women
[13:13.980 --> 13:14.980]  and they want to conform in their culture
[13:15.980 --> 13:16.980]  they're from New York
[13:17.980 --> 13:18.980]  and they continue to try to virtue signal
[13:19.980 --> 13:21.980]  and I'm sure that Trump's daughter could end up
[13:21.980 --> 13:23.980]  being president of Anka someday
[13:24.980 --> 13:25.980]  she's beautiful, she's smart
[13:26.980 --> 13:27.980]  but she's a compromiser
[13:29.980 --> 13:30.980]  and as I go off another side issue
[13:31.980 --> 13:32.980]  I can just see into the future
[13:33.980 --> 13:34.980]  as anybody else could see
[13:35.980 --> 13:36.980]  not with magical powers
[13:37.980 --> 13:38.980]  but with the powers of deduction God gave us
[13:39.980 --> 13:41.980]  and I can tell you now undoubtedly
[13:42.980 --> 13:43.980]  that it's the same spirit that Trump has
[13:44.980 --> 13:45.980]  that I have in that
[13:47.980 --> 13:48.980]  I am so confident
[13:48.980 --> 13:49.980]  and confident
[13:51.980 --> 13:52.980]  not in an arrogant way
[13:53.980 --> 13:54.980]  but that I couldn't lie to somebody
[13:55.980 --> 13:56.980]  or try to hold them down
[13:57.980 --> 13:58.980]  so I would feel powerful over them
[13:59.980 --> 14:00.980]  and it's that simple spirit
[14:01.980 --> 14:02.980]  that separates us from the devil worse person
[14:03.980 --> 14:04.980]  that's who they are
[14:05.980 --> 14:06.980]  it's all about them
[14:07.980 --> 14:08.980]  total selfishness
[14:09.980 --> 14:10.980]  well we're going to make it all about us
[14:11.980 --> 14:12.980]  you want to dominate destroy us
[14:13.980 --> 14:14.980]  it is about us all of us together
[14:15.980 --> 14:16.980]  not you
[14:16.980 --> 14:17.980]  not you getting out of the way
[14:18.980 --> 14:19.980]  and getting behind us Satan
[14:20.980 --> 14:21.980]  and it really does come down to those
[14:22.980 --> 14:23.980]  union
[14:26.980 --> 14:27.980]  archetypes
[14:28.980 --> 14:29.980]  but that's where we are
[14:30.980 --> 14:31.980]  and I mean I knew globalism was real
[14:32.980 --> 14:33.980]  I knew there were a world government plan was real
[14:34.980 --> 14:35.980]  I was reading the white papers
[14:36.980 --> 14:37.980]  seeing it happen
[14:38.980 --> 14:39.980]  reading stuff they wrote 50 years ago
[14:40.980 --> 14:41.980]  and seeing it come through in the early 90s
[14:42.980 --> 14:43.980]  and with exact programming
[14:43.980 --> 14:44.980]  I had a lot of conversations every two months
[14:45.980 --> 14:46.980]  when it came out
[14:47.980 --> 14:48.980]  and then telling people
[14:49.980 --> 14:50.980]  and having news articles written about me saying
[14:51.980 --> 14:52.980]  this man's a liar he's dangerous
[14:54.980 --> 14:55.980]  and then having news reporters go
[14:56.980 --> 14:57.980]  listen we're mercenaries
[14:58.980 --> 14:59.980]  we really agree with you
[15:00.980 --> 15:01.980]  keep it up with tears on their eyes
[15:04.980 --> 15:05.980]  Democrat politicians coming over to me
[15:06.980 --> 15:07.980]  and going listen son
[15:08.980 --> 15:09.980]  we like what you're doing
[15:10.980 --> 15:11.980]  a lot of us made wrong choices
[15:11.980 --> 15:12.980]  I hope you're successful
[15:13.980 --> 15:14.980]  and the Republican blue blood trash
[15:15.980 --> 15:16.980]  they're the worst
[15:17.980 --> 15:18.980]  the point is is that
[15:19.980 --> 15:20.980]  just as Americana was born
[15:21.980 --> 15:22.980]  as Alexander de Tocqueville the historian wrote about
[15:23.980 --> 15:24.980]  about not liking royalty not liking class

[19:52.980 --> 19:53.980]  triple eight two five three three one three nine
[19:53.980 --> 20:19.980]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[20:20.980 --> 20:21.980]  waging war on corruption
[20:21.980 --> 20:22.980]  it's Alex Jones
[20:23.980 --> 20:24.980]  coming to you live
[20:25.980 --> 20:26.980]  from the front lines
[20:27.980 --> 20:28.980]  of the info war
[20:29.980 --> 20:30.980]  now I know as an audience
[20:31.980 --> 20:32.980]  you know Russiagate is fake
[20:33.980 --> 20:34.980]  and then it was the Clintons did it
[20:35.980 --> 20:36.980]  and the Podestas did it
[20:37.980 --> 20:38.980]  because they were up their eyeballs
[20:39.980 --> 20:40.980]  with Russian collusion
[20:41.980 --> 20:42.980]  and they were scared
[20:43.980 --> 20:44.980]  and so was the FBI director
[20:45.980 --> 20:46.980]  the former director
[20:47.980 --> 20:48.980]  McCabe, Rosenstein
[20:48.980 --> 20:50.980]  they sold out our uranium
[20:51.980 --> 20:52.980]  they're globalists
[20:53.980 --> 20:54.980]  they're not Russian agents
[20:55.980 --> 20:56.980]  they sell out to anybody
[20:57.980 --> 20:58.980]  that wants to gang rape America
[20:59.980 --> 21:00.980]  and so Trump comes in
[21:01.980 --> 21:02.980]  and says we're not going to have
[21:03.980 --> 21:04.980]  38.9% taxes
[21:05.980 --> 21:06.980]  and China has 15
[21:07.980 --> 21:08.980]  we're going to have 15
[21:09.980 --> 21:10.980]  and so China by the way
[21:11.980 --> 21:12.980]  lowered his taxes to zero
[21:13.980 --> 21:14.980]  to counter America
[21:15.980 --> 21:16.980]  see how that works folks
[21:16.980 --> 21:17.980]  and so we're going to have
[21:18.980 --> 21:20.980]  the history of this
[21:21.980 --> 21:22.980]  of this story
[21:24.980 --> 21:25.980]  because remember
[21:26.980 --> 21:27.980]  I had been called a Russian agent
[21:28.980 --> 21:29.980]  they have congressional hearings
[21:30.980 --> 21:31.980]  in the Senate in the House
[21:32.980 --> 21:33.980]  armed services intelligence committees
[21:34.980 --> 21:35.980]  we've played the clips here at nauseam
[21:36.980 --> 21:37.980]  every new listener I know this sounds
[21:38.980 --> 21:39.980]  crazy but I'm not going to play them again
[21:40.980 --> 21:41.980]  you can look them up
[21:42.980 --> 21:43.980]  they're on info wars.com
[21:43.980 --> 21:45.980]  then they say but he is one
[21:46.980 --> 21:47.980]  so we're censoring Alex Jones
[21:53.980 --> 21:54.980]  they're using this to kill dissent
[21:55.980 --> 21:56.980]  and finally CNN
[21:57.980 --> 21:58.980]  the New York Times
[22:00.980 --> 22:01.980]  I mean I've got a stack of news
[22:02.980 --> 22:03.980]  I'm going to go over here in a minute
[22:04.980 --> 22:05.980]  mainstream news today
[22:06.980 --> 22:07.980]  coming out saying Russiagate
[22:08.980 --> 22:09.980]  is devolving into an effort to stigmatize dissent
[22:10.980 --> 22:11.980]  it didn't devolve
[22:11.980 --> 22:13.980]  Hitler didn't devolve into a Nazi
[22:14.980 --> 22:15.980]  in 1945 he was a Nazi
[22:16.980 --> 22:18.980]  Don Aria does it devolve into Don Aria
[22:20.980 --> 22:21.980]  okay
[22:23.980 --> 22:24.980]  but why are they all coming out
[22:25.980 --> 22:26.980]  this weekend in the last week
[22:28.980 --> 22:29.980]  why are they all coming out
[22:30.980 --> 22:31.980]  suddenly saying okay it's a total fraud
[22:32.980 --> 22:33.980]  it's authoritarian it's all a lie
[22:34.980 --> 22:35.980]  because they got caught
[22:36.980 --> 22:37.980]  and it blew up in their face
[22:38.980 --> 22:39.980]  I mean I'm not going to go over it again
[22:39.980 --> 22:41.980]  but there are 26 Justice Department
[22:42.980 --> 22:43.980]  and FBI people that are senior
[22:44.980 --> 22:45.980]  and five or six others we found
[22:46.980 --> 22:47.980]  but they're mid-level aids
[22:48.980 --> 22:49.980]  but there's like 26
[22:50.980 --> 22:51.980]  27 depending on how you look at it
[22:52.980 --> 22:53.980]  Justice Department and FBI officials
[22:54.980 --> 22:55.980]  who were all running the Russiagate thing
[22:56.980 --> 22:57.980]  and then they like basically all
[22:58.980 --> 22:59.980]  except for a couple gave money
[23:00.980 --> 23:01.980]  to their wives and husbands
[23:02.980 --> 23:03.980]  of government money in the millions
[23:04.980 --> 23:05.980]  to put out the PP Gay dossier
[23:06.980 --> 23:07.980]  so not only is the PP Gay
[23:07.980 --> 23:08.980]  a fake with Buzzfeed
[23:09.980 --> 23:10.980]  they're getting sued
[23:11.980 --> 23:12.980]  and getting basically bankrupt over it reportedly
[23:13.980 --> 23:14.980]  it's not just that
[23:15.980 --> 23:16.980]  the real crime is the millions of
[23:17.980 --> 23:18.980]  taxpayer dollars from the FBI
[23:19.980 --> 23:20.980]  and Justice Department
[23:21.980 --> 23:22.980]  to the wives and husbands
[23:23.980 --> 23:24.980]  of people at Fusion GPS that made it up
[23:25.980 --> 23:26.980]  I mean it was like a 40 something page
[23:27.980 --> 23:28.980]  report that a 10 year old could have written
[23:29.980 --> 23:30.980]  it's so badly written
[23:31.980 --> 23:32.980]  it was like it was written in finger paints
[23:33.980 --> 23:34.980]  or something
[23:34.980 --> 23:36.980]  as a dollar to write it
[23:37.980 --> 23:38.980]  so this has blown up so bad
[23:39.980 --> 23:40.980]  so crazily these arrogant people
[23:41.980 --> 23:42.980]  thought they were invincible
[23:43.980 --> 23:44.980]  because the power went to their heads
[23:46.980 --> 23:47.980]  and so now
[23:48.980 --> 23:49.980]  the New York Times
[23:50.980 --> 23:51.980]  CNN
[23:52.980 --> 23:53.980]  the nation they're not coming out
[23:54.980 --> 23:55.980]  in the last couple days
[23:56.980 --> 23:57.980]  soul started after Christmas
[23:58.980 --> 23:59.980]  last five days since the 26
[24:00.980 --> 24:01.980]  they didn't start coming out
[24:01.980 --> 24:07.200]  doing this because they really are suddenly good people they've been some
[24:07.200 --> 24:12.280]  of the biggest floggers of this they're letting people now come write the truth
[24:12.280 --> 24:17.640]  some of them who are good people by the way but bad publications because they
[24:17.640 --> 24:23.800]  know it's over so let me just announce to you right now Russia gay blew up in
[24:23.800 --> 24:27.480]  their face about a month ago as we first told you and as I've said it's over
[24:27.480 --> 24:31.000]  it's done but they're gonna try to paper over and keep the con game going it
[24:31.000 --> 24:37.120]  didn't work and now they have committed so many crimes leaking disinfo not just
[24:37.120 --> 24:40.720]  leaking they have been caught with the Russians with the Communist Chinese with
[24:40.720 --> 24:45.440]  everything they are crapping their britches shooing for peace with the
[24:45.440 --> 24:50.280]  president and I have told the president every time I talked to him I said when
[24:50.280 --> 24:55.480]  you defeat them in the next year and they sue for peace sir they are good
[24:55.480 --> 25:01.040]  that is when they're gonna try to assassinate you he says first time I told
[25:01.040 --> 25:03.960]  him he was very interesting hold on Alex he goes off because they go tell me
[25:03.960 --> 25:09.840]  more about that and I'm not gonna leave the rest of the conversation I'm gonna
[25:09.840 --> 25:14.640]  tell you anymore but Trump as the media points out does respect info wars and
[25:14.640 --> 25:18.840]  does respect our research because we're on target it's why the audience does and
[25:18.840 --> 25:24.360]  we have the sources and that's why they battle to keep the president from our
[25:24.360 --> 25:28.600]  information because a lot of it doesn't just come from me we're gonna have
[25:28.600 --> 25:32.840]  Michael Caputo a former advisor to Trump high-level on they try to keep him
[25:32.840 --> 25:36.400]  away from Caputo we get through to him through people close to president with
[25:36.400 --> 25:41.960]  this show and the president does end up watching clips every week he requests
[25:41.960 --> 25:45.600]  them and I'm just letting the media know that so they can know they failed
[25:45.600 --> 25:50.920]  visorably Michael Caputo is coming on Roger Stone Dr. Corsi because here's
[25:50.920 --> 26:00.400]  the big news the purge of the globalists not extra judicially not with death
[26:00.400 --> 26:04.360]  squads not outside law but through the Constitution and through the will of the
[26:04.360 --> 26:14.440]  people begins next week get ready because the hammer is coming down and the
[26:14.440 --> 26:20.280]  cleaning house is about to happen and from the beginning there was a split in
[26:20.280 --> 26:23.120]  the Trump administration or whether he should let the globalist creep off with
[26:23.120 --> 26:27.320]  their money leave him alone and they lied then and said they'd leave him alone
[26:27.320 --> 26:30.680]  but they never did and it wasn't like the president was selling out you know it
[26:30.680 --> 26:34.080]  might be best at one level not to have this civil war or not do all this because
[26:34.080 --> 26:38.280]  the globalists are dangerous but they'll never give up I can tell you now the
[26:38.280 --> 26:44.920]  president is decided to go on the offensive and it's happening Trump is
[26:44.920 --> 26:49.840]  getting ready to go on the offense in t-minus six and a half hours ladies and
[26:49.840 --> 27:02.480]  gentlemen so get ready for 2018 to be a whopper now understand this though we're
[27:02.480 --> 27:05.520]  not arrogant globalists think we're invincible and are powered wrong we've
[27:05.520 --> 27:09.800]  got major beachheads the public starting to wake up globally globalisms and
[27:09.800 --> 27:13.800]  troubles it's so authoritarian but we've got a replacement at every level with
[27:13.800 --> 27:19.800]  integrity and honor and truth and justice and classic populism and a
[27:19.800 --> 27:24.560]  respect of the people and a respect of women and a respect of men and a
[27:24.560 --> 27:30.000]  respect of children and a respect of each other because our country and the
[27:30.000 --> 27:35.560]  world has gone through grievous wounds of globalist engineering and we're in
[27:35.560 --> 27:42.160]  deep trouble I'm only happy because it's like we're in a coma and we started
[27:42.160 --> 27:46.680]  babbling and our eyes opened and you know America's had a big bowel movement
[27:46.680 --> 27:50.880]  we're kind of flopping around here on the table going you know but at least
[27:50.880 --> 27:57.040]  something's going on I use that gross analogy if someone that comes out of a
[27:57.040 --> 28:02.800]  big coma that usually happens I mean I mean we're but you know we're there
[28:02.800 --> 28:06.360]  folks we're coming out of the trance the sleeping giants awakening and praise
[28:06.360 --> 28:14.960]  God you know I talked about our Trump absolutely is delivering and after all
[28:14.960 --> 28:18.120]  these decades of betrayal wouldn't that be the smart move even for a sociopath
[28:18.120 --> 28:23.360]  I'm not saying he's a sociopath he's the opposite people said well you better
[28:23.360 --> 28:28.360]  thank God I thank God constantly but I also want to thank you and God thanks
[28:28.360 --> 28:32.440]  you because you carry the light and the dark of the night and I don't care what
[28:32.440 --> 28:37.240]  color you are where you came from I love you and you're strong you've got will
[28:37.240 --> 28:40.400]  and you're positive and that's what it really matters the globalist want to
[28:40.400 --> 28:45.080]  make us negative and out of control and and and depressed and then and only make
[28:45.080 --> 28:48.680]  it them that are the good guys they and they make it all about them and what
[28:48.680 --> 28:52.880]  group you're in instead of being who you are as an individual and your
[28:52.880 --> 28:57.680]  connection to the universe your family your neighbors and God we'll be back
[28:57.680 --> 29:02.360]  introducing floor life the new probiotic line developed exclusively by
[29:02.360 --> 29:07.240]  info wars life after years of research on the human microbiome not all probiotics

[29:20.800 --> 29:24.040]  you don't have a targeted delivery probiotic then you're cheating your

[33:00.240 --> 33:11.920]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show from the front lines of the
[33:11.920 --> 33:20.760]  information war it's Alex Jones okay Roger Stone has some of the biggest
[33:20.760 --> 33:24.920]  news he's ever broken coming on this broadcast in the last two and a half
[33:24.920 --> 33:31.200]  years and when he told me this stuff yesterday I wanted to go live with me
[33:31.200 --> 33:34.440]  said no it's not gonna leak so many times he tells me something and then it
[33:34.440 --> 33:40.120]  leaks just like well then hundreds of times he breaks up before anybody else
[33:40.120 --> 33:47.600]  does and then of course that's admitted but this is directly out of the mouth of
[33:47.600 --> 33:51.880]  one of the highest level people in the White House now they may change their
[33:51.880 --> 33:58.040]  mind about resigning and it's not tellersen tellersen was gonna resign and
[33:58.040 --> 34:01.320]  now I was doing some face-saving stuff and it's back and forth that could happen
[34:01.320 --> 34:05.200]  the next month it's somebody else and this is important though because who
[34:05.200 --> 34:10.720]  they want to replace them with so that's coming up and we've got Michael
[34:10.720 --> 34:13.600]  Caputo former high-level Trump advisor who's been accused being a Russian
[34:13.600 --> 34:17.320]  agent with no evidence just like I have I'm like call me in the court I want the
[34:17.320 --> 34:20.960]  FBI to come over here and I've said it on there I've actually called on my
[34:20.960 --> 34:28.880]  shelf and demanded they come here and put up a shut up and of course there's
[34:28.880 --> 34:32.120]  just like yeah I'm certainly laughing yes mr. Jones we understand you're not a
[34:32.120 --> 34:35.800]  Russian agent and all the Russians I mean I've said I want to be in front of
[34:35.800 --> 34:40.680]  Congress I mean I'm sick of this I'm tired of this because I want lower taxes
[34:40.680 --> 34:44.960]  and sovereignty and to control our borders and I'm pro-Christian and pro-
[34:44.960 --> 34:49.000]  free market I'm a Russian agent well then we better all be Russian agents then
[34:49.000 --> 34:52.400]  think how crazy that is once the Democrats and the globalists that hate
[34:52.400 --> 34:58.120]  this country they've been trying to destroy it forever but if you just
[34:58.120 --> 35:02.280]  joined us I'm going to Dr. Jerome Corsi in this segment the next and and because
[35:02.280 --> 35:07.480]  he's been hammering on what is in the eight-chan boards and QAnon and the rest
[35:07.480 --> 35:10.520]  of it and you can look at what QAnon says a lot of it's accurate but that
[35:10.520 --> 35:15.640]  doesn't matter we can see in real news what's happening and how Trump is
[35:15.640 --> 35:19.320]  purging the pedophiles he is purging the money launders he is going after the
[35:19.320 --> 35:24.520]  globalists this is all happening and it's about to go supernova next year
[35:24.520 --> 35:30.400]  his first year with Trump is salvage next year is destroyed that means go
[35:30.400 --> 35:35.200]  after the bad guys and you see nothing but promise keeping on TPP on nap to on
[35:35.200 --> 35:38.680]  get on tax cuts on killing the single-payer mandate which is
[35:38.680 --> 35:45.400]  Obamacare I mean quite frankly Ronald Reagan got half done what Trump's done
[35:45.400 --> 35:50.200]  in eight years okay and I'm not saying Reagan was a bad guy but first year he
[35:50.200 --> 35:55.440]  was great and he kind of went away this is amazing so that's coming up with
[35:55.440 --> 36:01.200]  exclusive info but Trump is right about the FBI New York Times the nation
[36:01.200 --> 36:05.760]  Russia gate devolving into an effort to stigmatize the scent the nation here's
[36:05.760 --> 36:10.680]  another one I don't even look for these it's everywhere Tampa Bay in text FBI
[36:10.680 --> 36:16.240]  officials in Russia inquiry said Clinton just has to win liberal publication
[36:16.240 --> 36:22.200]  says in each day at the agent removed from Russia probe called Trump an idiot
[36:22.200 --> 36:27.920]  Omaha World Herald it goes on and on they're only doing this because it's
[36:27.920 --> 36:31.600]  blown up in their face and now they've gone and sued for peace I can tell you
[36:31.600 --> 36:36.760]  they've gone to Mar-Lago different globalist emissaries and said okay
[36:36.760 --> 36:41.560]  you're right okay you're making a country great again we'll leave you alone that I
[36:41.560 --> 36:47.760]  believe at a gut level is a foil is a they're feigning and then when they
[36:47.760 --> 36:51.840]  feign this way they're gonna come back and try to stab us that's their very
[36:51.840 --> 36:56.000]  nature they're dishonorable we'll talk to dr. Corsi here in a moment first off if
[36:56.000 --> 36:59.960]  you want to really be revolutionary by the products at infowarstore.com and a
[36:59.960 --> 37:02.960]  lot of you are and I salute you thank you it's how we've got to watch DC
[37:02.960 --> 37:05.720]  correspondent like dr. Corsi so we're getting all these other correspondents
[37:05.720 --> 37:08.480]  I'm gonna announce the next month it's how we're building all these big new
[37:08.480 --> 37:13.160]  studios and expanding and I'm putting everything back into this because I'm
[37:13.160 --> 37:16.320]  totally committed we're getting so censored on the internet thank God we're
[37:16.320 --> 37:20.680]  expanding on AM and FM and UHF VHF and cable but all these different stations
[37:20.680 --> 37:23.880]  what different types of satellites I'm looking at a million a half dollars a
[37:23.880 --> 37:28.000]  year to just deliver this to stations and they're ready hundreds of stations
[37:28.000 --> 37:32.280]  you're like well I already listened to you I know it's for people that don't and
[37:32.280 --> 37:36.840]  that sounds like a lot of money it's not when Beck spent $25 million a year just
[37:36.840 --> 37:40.360]  on his Glenn Beck channel but there's thousands of channels on cable and I'm
[37:40.360 --> 37:43.040]  not a rocket scientist but the consultants agree with me because they
[37:43.040 --> 37:47.560]  tried to sell me Beck's channel he just tried to get out of it you know last
[37:47.560 --> 37:51.640]  year brokers did and he said oh well he got it for 20 million well it's 10
[37:51.640 --> 37:54.900]  million a year for you and I'm like I'm not doing it so I'm like oh now let's
[37:54.900 --> 37:58.800]  don't channel on cable it doesn't matter now it's oversaturated but the reason
[37:58.800 --> 38:01.920]  I'm giving you inside baseball is understand I went we need to be on all
[38:01.920 --> 38:07.120]  the satellites and systems so UHF VHF and cable stations can pick it up where
[38:07.120 --> 38:11.240]  they want and reach out to the program directors well I never even launched
[38:11.240 --> 38:15.000]  these programs but it's they're already just doing it off one satellite we're on
[38:15.000 --> 38:18.960]  but I've got the wrong one it's like 400,000 a year and there's a lot of
[38:18.960 --> 38:22.560]  rocket science goes into this okay but I'm just gonna put my us on like five
[38:22.560 --> 38:25.880]  satellites so everything they want is there but it's gonna cost a million a
[38:25.880 --> 38:29.320]  half dollars a year buy some vitamins buy some minerals buy some water filters
[38:29.320 --> 38:32.280]  you need them they're great we're delivering we're changing the world
[38:32.280 --> 38:37.920]  we're the vanguard of the reassertors of America you are supporting us so we're
[38:37.920 --> 38:41.200]  all in this together but they're coming after us they're cutting off our
[38:41.200 --> 38:45.400]  sponsors they cut us off Google ads they've got lawsuits that I don't want to
[38:45.400 --> 38:48.280]  get into going on behind the scenes because most of them have already been
[38:48.280 --> 38:53.680]  defeated the point is is that is that they're coming after us congressmen they
[38:53.680 --> 38:57.800]  censor us go get free shipping it's about to end the next two days extended

[40:27.240 --> 40:30.120]  five three three one three nine all right we've got it for this segment the
[40:30.120 --> 40:34.240]  next two Dr. Jerome Corsi best-selling number one New York Times
[40:34.240 --> 40:40.080]  with something author geopolitical expert Harvard graduate top expert on
[40:40.080 --> 40:44.680]  banking former state department advisor he's joining us we're going to break
[40:44.680 --> 40:48.240]  here in a few minutes but doc we haven't talked a couple weeks do you concur or
[40:48.240 --> 40:51.680]  what do you add to suddenly have establishment media saying okay Russia
[40:51.680 --> 40:55.840]  gates of fraud the FBI has been discredited we've got to stop this
[40:55.840 --> 40:59.840]  signals but we already knows gone on behind the scenes they've run up the
[40:59.840 --> 41:03.920]  white flag to the president at least for now at least certain elements of it I
[41:03.920 --> 41:08.000]  think this is a deception what do you think dr. Corsi well I think it's
[41:08.000 --> 41:13.040]  largely that the whole Russia gate narrative is failed and that it's clear
[41:13.040 --> 41:17.120]  it's failed I mean even the New York Times is trying to substitute a narrative
[41:17.120 --> 41:22.000]  that was one of the lower down of figures in the campaign talking trash
[41:22.000 --> 41:26.440]  having drinks I mean the whole thing is clear that the the Russia gate is a no
[41:26.440 --> 41:30.520]  evidence and has been no evidence from the beginning and what you've had is
[41:30.520 --> 41:37.360]  it's turned on the Democrats and that now we know this fusion GPS document was
[41:37.360 --> 41:43.080]  used to get the FISA wiretapping the electronic surveillance Donald Trump was
[41:43.080 --> 41:47.880]  right he was under electronic surveillance so was his campaign and I
[41:47.880 --> 41:53.400]  think that basis of that wiretap the fusion GPS is fraudulent well of course
[41:53.400 --> 41:57.800]  it was how could they be so arrogant to commit all these crimes criminal leaks
[41:57.800 --> 42:03.480]  make stuff up and now be caught a Clinton coterie a cabal in there trying to
[42:03.480 --> 42:09.520]  frame the president thus the voters of America I think they got used to under
[42:09.520 --> 42:14.600]  the Clinton years of having this compliant mainstream media laptop media
[42:14.600 --> 42:19.120]  that repeated everything that Obama and Clinton wanted said everything the deep
[42:19.120 --> 42:23.840]  state wanted parroted and broadcast and what you find out is now you've got a
[42:23.840 --> 42:28.600]  situation where the public is listening to Donald Trump Donald Trump is a whole
[42:28.600 --> 42:33.040]  different force to be reckoned with and you know the mainstream media the deep
[42:33.040 --> 42:36.760]  state have never dealt with someone like Donald Trump but I think it's pretty
[42:36.760 --> 42:41.200]  startling what we've been reporting in the last week on this executive order
[42:41.200 --> 42:44.560]  that was signed that's what's coming up next I should have said always saved the
[42:44.560 --> 42:47.880]  best for last you're coming on about the executive order going up the money

[47:36.480 --> 47:53.520]  if you are receiving this transmission we are go all right doc lay it out in
[47:53.520 --> 47:59.120]  this segment for people because we know Trump is moving against the globalist
[47:59.120 --> 48:03.520]  there they are so treasonous they're an outside power this is important it's a
[48:03.520 --> 48:07.160]  very important it's as important as world war two quite frankly globalism as
[48:07.160 --> 48:12.080]  you know and we're a best-selling author working with Lou Dobbs with the
[48:12.080 --> 48:17.640]  number one show on TV at the time exposing that and now here we are from
[48:17.640 --> 48:22.600]  being voices in the wilderness myself Ron Paul Matt Drudge so many others
[48:22.600 --> 48:27.920]  President Trump 30 years ago 29 years ago whatever right and op-eds against
[48:27.920 --> 48:33.800]  napkin get I mean here we all are and now we're moving into the position of
[48:33.800 --> 48:38.800]  not being in control but getting some of the tentacles off the throat of America
[48:38.800 --> 48:43.160]  and we see life coming back in and we see the globalist panicking and we see
[48:43.160 --> 48:48.240]  now the emails of Aberdeen coming out confirming that she had classified info
[48:48.240 --> 48:52.160]  and that Hillary lied I mean you can see that Trump has taken the gloves off he's
[48:52.160 --> 48:55.440]  known for that I think he gave Hillary and the globalist their chance to kind
[48:55.440 --> 49:00.160]  of like Napoleon go to the island of Alba but I think like Napoleon they came
[49:00.160 --> 49:04.680]  back and so this time they're gonna get locked up for real give a sure analysis
[49:04.680 --> 49:09.880]  and where this is going Trump is at war with the swamp he's hired some swamp
[49:09.880 --> 49:13.600]  creatures to be his guides but all I care about is results we're getting
[49:13.600 --> 49:17.960]  unprecedented results and quite frankly I'm surprised how much results Trump's
[49:17.960 --> 49:23.120]  gotten this is quite a turnabout here well and we've been following I've been
[49:23.120 --> 49:27.680]  very closely following this Q and on and I started it when the executive order
[49:27.680 --> 49:32.840]  came out on the 21st which was really you know just a few days ago this
[49:32.840 --> 49:37.840]  executive order suddenly appears president Trump signs it and he says that
[49:37.840 --> 49:44.040]  this is against international trafficking human rights violations and the
[49:44.040 --> 49:49.280]  executive order declares that a national emergency exists the state of
[49:49.280 --> 49:54.120]  international emergency exists it's not only that we have that the Treasury
[49:54.120 --> 49:58.000]  Department has the right to confiscate the assets of those involved in human
[49:58.000 --> 50:03.240]  rights trafficking but also that the state of emergency is in place which
[50:03.240 --> 50:08.520]  means we're under martial law for this category of offenses and then Q and on
[50:08.520 --> 50:14.800]  links it to Eric Schmidt and Eric Schmidt resigns the same day that from
[50:14.800 --> 50:19.260]  alphabet is head of alphabet the same day that this executive order is coming
[50:19.260 --> 50:24.640]  out and they're and they're linked because you see the extensive funding
[50:24.640 --> 50:31.160]  and involvement acute on to this long narrative which we decoded and it was
[50:31.160 --> 50:35.840]  clear that part of that narrative central to it was the fact that Eric Schmidt
[50:35.840 --> 50:42.040]  had funded Hillary run her it department was involved very deeply in this
[50:42.040 --> 50:49.120]  crowd and that ties into Pakistan right ties into Pakistan all this ties
[50:49.120 --> 50:54.520]  into the entire development of the Russian collusion narrative now what it
[50:54.520 --> 50:58.520]  looks like and you know we've been able to confirm a variety of things from the
[50:58.520 --> 51:03.280]  Q and on I mean this national well let me just say this stop you I'm gonna hold
[51:03.280 --> 51:06.520]  you in the next seven let me just say this to stop you right I mean you you've
[51:06.520 --> 51:09.160]  been at the highest levels of banking friends with Donald Trump you've got all
[51:09.160 --> 51:14.000]  your own CIA connections so do I where he's a Q and on so important is much of
[51:14.000 --> 51:19.480]  what he's saying is the same Intel we're getting and so and then it's gotten
[51:19.480 --> 51:23.160]  attention so it's a way to focus people and we're not lessening Q and on or 8
[51:23.160 --> 51:27.440]  channel the rest of it but this is a real executive order and as you said a
[51:27.440 --> 51:32.000]  lot of my listeners went Alex this is martial law this executive order well
[51:32.000 --> 51:35.360]  we're under globalist attack they've seized the country he's cutting your
[51:35.360 --> 51:38.880]  taxes he's securing the borders he's taking care of the veterans he's trying
[51:38.880 --> 51:42.080]  to take care of old people he's getting rid of Obamacare meant to screw you
[51:42.080 --> 51:46.760]  over when you're in a war it's martial law against the globalist if they start
[51:46.760 --> 51:50.240]  using it against the people I'll go create that's not what's happening we're
[51:50.240 --> 51:54.640]  under globalist foundation control and if Trump's gonna take the gloves off when
[51:54.640 --> 51:58.120]  deep states openly saying killing and he's got to get geared up to do this
[51:58.120 --> 52:03.200]  cutting off Saudi Arabia going and making them make a deal cutting off the
[52:03.200 --> 52:05.920]  Clintons and globalist money that's where it was coming from that's what
[52:05.920 --> 52:10.080]  Vegas was about I have my own military intelligence and CIA sources that are
[52:10.080 --> 52:13.560]  saying on air like Zach I'm not going to say his real name obviously Zach's
[52:13.560 --> 52:17.880]  first name who are giving us the exact same intel before Q and on so all I'm
[52:17.880 --> 52:22.520]  saying is we're confirming what Q and on saying from our own sources and it's
[52:22.520 --> 52:27.080]  incredibly bold well and also I think you know Q and on is clearly an
[52:27.080 --> 52:31.120]  intelligence source of one kind or another as inside information I mean I'm
[52:31.120 --> 52:36.640]  able to code it from the background I've got an intelligence but Q and on is
[52:36.640 --> 52:41.760]  validating Alex the things that you've been saying for years and you know that's
[52:41.760 --> 52:45.960]  where the affinity comes he's giving there's background here that validates
[52:45.960 --> 52:49.600]  all the points that you've been making about the globalist the martial law is
[52:49.600 --> 52:53.800]  here that my martial law was declared in that executive order and Trump is going
[52:53.800 --> 52:58.320]  after the money of human rights violators and which again explain that's
[52:58.320 --> 53:03.000]  that's the that's the main funding of the globalist system explain that yeah
[53:03.000 --> 53:06.880]  well that's the key I mean the whole funding this whole pedophilia and I
[53:06.880 --> 53:10.840]  mean you were pounded months ago for going after this but I think now it's
[53:10.840 --> 53:15.800]  going to be validated you're going to be vindicated in 2018 because this whole
[53:15.800 --> 53:21.760]  pedophilia network which is billions and billions of dollars has been in
[53:21.760 --> 53:27.840]  intertwined and in Wall Street it's intertwined in the news media in
[53:27.840 --> 53:32.960]  Hollywood you see it in the political circles and I think Donald Trump's going
[53:32.960 --> 53:37.640]  after it I mean and it is validation I wanted to point out I was able to
[53:37.640 --> 53:43.040]  validate that this Arizona National Guard unit has just been moved from Phoenix
[53:43.040 --> 53:51.000]  they moved about four dozen soldiers part of the 850 unit National Guard which
[53:51.000 --> 53:56.080]  are military police battalion have just been moved to Gitmo and that's after you
[53:56.080 --> 54:02.320]  had your secretary defense madness visit Gitmo you've had turning general
[54:02.320 --> 54:07.440]  sessions visit Gitmo I mean clearly something is going on and this executive
[54:07.440 --> 54:14.240]  order is a clear definition declaration that we are in a state of emergency which
[54:14.240 --> 54:18.840]  gives the powers of the presidency really exceptional characteristics and
[54:18.840 --> 54:22.760]  ability and let's be clear the the Democrats people say Alex you're the one
[54:22.760 --> 54:25.720]  that always warned of this now you're for it the Democrats have announced we
[54:25.720 --> 54:29.440]  want a state of emergency we want civil unrest we want Trump arrested or killed
[54:29.440 --> 54:32.760]  we want to kill all the Republicans hashtag kill Republicans they're
[54:32.760 --> 54:37.900]  building towards this emergency as they said in December so Trump put this in
[54:37.900 --> 54:42.000]  with the Intel to basically block their funding you already cut off Saudi Arabia
[54:42.000 --> 54:47.160]  so again folks he's blocking them with the executive power they're wrongly
[54:47.160 --> 54:52.000]  trying to launch this without executive power as a rogue group it clearly this is
[54:52.000 --> 54:56.360]  what's happening and the word is that what we're seeing with QAnon and my
[54:56.360 --> 55:00.200]  other sources that are confirmed high-level Army special operations
[55:00.200 --> 55:04.600]  command you name it is that this what we're seeing from QAnon is warnings to
[55:04.600 --> 55:08.720]  Hillary and warnings to Soros that you're gonna be in Gitmo if you keep
[55:08.720 --> 55:12.720]  pushing it not that they're actually gonna be going there go ahead well and
[55:12.720 --> 55:20.000]  also Alex I want to point out that the two gentlemen who run the QAnon in a
[55:20.000 --> 55:26.040]  can also on the reddit the subreddit which is you know the calm before the
[55:26.040 --> 55:33.360]  storm CBTS underscores stream came on the show on out you came on your show
[55:33.360 --> 55:37.920]  last week and spent a good deal of time and was it was all over the subreddit
[55:37.920 --> 55:43.040]  sit you just calm before the storm slash stream and and with hundreds of
[55:43.040 --> 55:48.160]  responses to a couple hundred that I read so you see the QAnon is acknowledging
[55:48.160 --> 55:52.920]  that in fact you Alex have been ahead of the curve and that your audience is a
[55:52.920 --> 55:56.440]  head of the curve exactly it's not about you and I know you're just pointing out
[55:56.440 --> 55:59.760]  we've been right but yeah it's not about us I'm just pointing out this is real
[55:59.760 --> 56:03.680]  we've had Phil Mudd the former head of counterterrorism saying we're going to
[56:03.680 --> 56:08.280]  kill the president on CNN I mean they did that to rally their troops to say
[56:08.280 --> 56:13.080]  I mean that what's the word though because the last five days they have
[56:13.080 --> 56:16.680]  been signaling that they're backing off they crap their pants after this
[56:16.680 --> 56:22.400]  executive order McCabe announced he's resigning leaving Schmidt I mean they're
[56:22.400 --> 56:26.680]  really signaling that they've that they're scared well I think what we're
[56:26.680 --> 56:31.320]  seeing is this is the beginning of the Trump counterattack and it has I think
[56:31.320 --> 56:35.760]  two elements to it one is you see Trump very effectively working now with
[56:35.760 --> 56:41.120]  Congress Nuna's in the Senate you're gonna see Gaudi and Jim Jordan and the
[56:41.120 --> 56:46.880]  House who are gonna press these issues of McCabe and Strozik and all the
[56:46.880 --> 56:52.360]  holdovers from Obama that were really determined to run a very biased FBI and
[56:52.360 --> 56:57.080]  Department of Justice that was gonna get excused Hillary of everything and go
[56:57.080 --> 57:02.560]  after Trump on fake charges of this whole Russian collusion issue now what
[57:02.560 --> 57:07.000]  you've got in this and what you've got going on I think extremely here is the
[57:07.000 --> 57:10.120]  Trump is saying I've had enough of it and what he's gonna do is he's gonna
[57:10.120 --> 57:14.600]  counterattack he's gonna say I'm coming after you we're gonna get the money the
[57:14.600 --> 57:18.600]  money is gonna be the number one target and the money is I think cut off is
[57:18.600 --> 57:25.400]  gonna severely limit the ability of the you know of the deep state to operate

[59:50.160 --> 1:00:09.520]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show the answer to 1984 is 1776 you're
[1:00:09.520 --> 1:00:18.440]  listening to the Alex Jones show ladies and gentlemen Dr. Corsi is a
[1:00:18.440 --> 1:00:22.000]  Harvard educated political scientist three-time number one New York Times
[1:00:22.000 --> 1:00:26.160]  bestseller and he doesn't hype stuff up as you know and I'll be honest with you
[1:00:26.160 --> 1:00:29.960]  I'm not mad at myself but when I read the executive order last week I said
[1:00:29.960 --> 1:00:33.920]  this is martial law and I understood what the president was doing and I meant
[1:00:33.920 --> 1:00:38.040]  to come on air and say it's basically financial martial law against
[1:00:38.040 --> 1:00:44.160]  multinational combines and these big foundations and then I just never came on
[1:00:44.160 --> 1:00:50.360]  air and did it but Corsi is now bringing it down and we really are under a civil
[1:00:50.360 --> 1:00:55.760]  emergency a national emergency has been declared by President Trump but the
[1:00:55.760 --> 1:00:58.960]  globalists were announcing they want their own national emergency and to take
[1:00:58.960 --> 1:01:03.160]  Trump out so it's very constitutional what he's doing as president but an
[1:01:03.160 --> 1:01:06.520]  outside group is doing this and he's only targeting them and he went and made
[1:01:06.520 --> 1:01:10.520]  deals with Saudi Arabia to cut off the funding to the globalist big things are
[1:01:10.520 --> 1:01:14.760]  happening this is so epic I can't believe it and everything Trump's doing is
[1:01:14.760 --> 1:01:20.800]  delivering power back to the people as he pledged a year and 11 days ago or
[1:01:20.800 --> 1:01:27.080]  don't know 11 months and 11 days ago or whatever it was on January 20th 2017 so
[1:01:27.080 --> 1:01:31.360]  as we end the year about four minutes left dr. Corsi this is so epic this is
[1:01:31.360 --> 1:01:36.200]  so big this is so huge well I think you see there's a good first of all with
[1:01:36.200 --> 1:01:41.320]  Saudi Arabia it's down from visited Saudi Arabia and then very quickly after
[1:01:41.320 --> 1:01:47.120]  that the prince begins to round up all of the key operatives in Saudi Arabia and
[1:01:47.120 --> 1:01:52.440]  takes their money confiscates their money I'll a weed who is very very the
[1:01:52.440 --> 1:01:56.800]  main founder of Obama and Hillary and now it's happening here and the in this
[1:01:56.800 --> 1:01:59.920]  recent things the executive order and what the Treasury came out with an
[1:01:59.920 --> 1:02:04.520]  annex the people they're going after you know the vast majority of them have
[1:02:04.520 --> 1:02:09.400]  deep ties to the Clinton Foundation have deep ties to the Clinton global
[1:02:09.400 --> 1:02:13.600]  initiative these are international criminals that engage in a variety of
[1:02:13.600 --> 1:02:18.880]  activities including human rights abuses and human trafficking now if Donald
[1:02:18.880 --> 1:02:23.320]  Trump is going after the money again this is fun this is you know warfare this
[1:02:23.320 --> 1:02:30.040]  is a clear indication that Donald Trump understands the deep states use of money
[1:02:30.040 --> 1:02:35.760]  and their corruption and human resources you're gonna see millionaires
[1:02:35.760 --> 1:02:40.760]  suddenly leave the United States without explanation you're gonna see CEOs
[1:02:40.760 --> 1:02:46.560]  resigning without explanation you see suicides occur this is gonna be massive
[1:02:46.560 --> 1:02:49.880]  I believe and I think it's already started and Donald Trump is in a
[1:02:49.880 --> 1:02:57.520]  counterattack 2018 is gonna be the year of Donald Trump's counterattack well
[1:02:57.520 --> 1:03:01.960]  there's a headline on this epic live interview radio TV I'm gonna I'm gonna
[1:03:01.960 --> 1:03:07.040]  have it posted with you know that very headline the 2018 is the year of Donald
[1:03:07.040 --> 1:03:12.040]  Trump's counterattack that's so sensational and true but I mean it's
[1:03:12.040 --> 1:03:16.760]  even more sensational he's declared civil emergency to actually block them
[1:03:16.760 --> 1:03:21.080]  before they declare the civil emergency outside of law and cut their money off
[1:03:21.080 --> 1:03:25.880]  and he's done it I mean it's it's a it's a can you believe we've been so used to
[1:03:25.880 --> 1:03:31.600]  corruption and evil to now actually see a very pragmatic kind of JFK style tax
[1:03:31.600 --> 1:03:34.960]  plan that's actually for the people I mean I am just so proud that we back
[1:03:34.960 --> 1:03:40.040]  Trump Corsi well this is a Donald Trump's a chief executive he understands
[1:03:40.040 --> 1:03:44.000]  this is the first time we really had a pop president who's gonna use the
[1:03:44.000 --> 1:03:49.960]  enormous powers of the presidency for eliminating corruption not for advancing
[1:03:49.960 --> 1:03:54.160]  corruption they fired every lobbyist they don't ever he actually fired all
[1:03:54.160 --> 1:03:57.280]  lobbyists that's why they're pissed there's no lobbyists they're giving him
[1:03:57.280 --> 1:04:03.280]  ideas he fired he fired you know the whole section of the HIV AIDS group that
[1:04:03.280 --> 1:04:06.920]  was in the White House just got rid of them the whole group you know he's
[1:04:06.920 --> 1:04:11.840]  he's firing left and right not hiring in this even saying admitted that he has
[1:04:11.840 --> 1:04:16.720]  massively cut the government yes except for veterans affairs and the military
[1:04:16.720 --> 1:04:22.800]  and the presidency has enormous powers he's using them on executive orders to
[1:04:22.800 --> 1:04:27.520]  eliminate what he can of the government regulations and now he's gonna go after
[1:04:27.520 --> 1:04:33.560]  human event human rights violations which is gonna be epic I want you to

[1:06:44.120 --> 1:06:51.800]  I'll be honest with you ladies and gentlemen I intended to go to the
[1:06:51.800 --> 1:06:58.960]  grocery store yesterday and get a couple bottles of Dom Perignon or whatever to
[1:06:58.960 --> 1:07:04.120]  to my big champagne drinker but to drink them here less than a year later with
[1:07:04.120 --> 1:07:10.360]  Roger Stone tonight but I never called Roger I never you know did it and then
[1:07:10.360 --> 1:07:14.960]  sure enough I see him punched up on the skype here in the studio for the TV slash
[1:07:14.960 --> 1:07:21.560]  radio simulcast and there he is in a tuxedo with a martini I'm sure a dry
[1:07:21.560 --> 1:07:26.920]  martini I don't have a drink here to toast him but I'll toast my uromane tea
[1:07:26.920 --> 1:07:30.880]  because I got about nine at night if I don't drink uromane at this time so but
[1:07:30.880 --> 1:07:36.560]  I don't know is that good luck to toast iced tea with South American iced tea
[1:07:36.560 --> 1:07:43.080]  with a martini shaken not stirred we'll see but boy talk about celebration talk
[1:07:43.080 --> 1:07:47.160]  about delivery talk about us getting used to being lied to and told that
[1:07:47.160 --> 1:07:49.960]  politicians would never tell the truth guess what Donald Trump isn't one and
[1:07:49.960 --> 1:07:53.720]  he's draining the swamp he's on the offense we're gonna get into big
[1:07:53.720 --> 1:07:57.920]  breaking news we've given you positive news about the president going after the
[1:07:57.920 --> 1:08:03.240]  globalist declaring financial martial law over the foundations to counter them
[1:08:03.240 --> 1:08:08.120]  a good form of civil emergency but they're gonna be counter striking but
[1:08:08.120 --> 1:08:14.800]  Roger Stone my friend it is good to share New Year's Eve with you my comrade in
[1:08:14.800 --> 1:08:21.280]  libertarian capitalism Alex happy new year I hope you had a terrific holiday
[1:08:21.280 --> 1:08:28.320]  season boy the president has delivered our presence in spades the elitists are
[1:08:28.320 --> 1:08:34.320]  hysterical near suicidal because both on the economic front on the foreign
[1:08:34.320 --> 1:08:39.320]  policy front the president is doing exactly what he told the American people
[1:08:39.320 --> 1:08:44.160]  he would do something that's unheard of in American politics a candidate who
[1:08:44.160 --> 1:08:50.440]  gets elected and actually delivers on their platform and now with this new
[1:08:50.440 --> 1:08:55.320]  executive order which David and I and I spoke about extensively yesterday
[1:08:55.320 --> 1:09:01.280]  morning he's laid the groundwork for a sweep up of the bad guys you can see
[1:09:01.280 --> 1:09:08.400]  that this was specifically tailored for the uranium one situation for a sweep
[1:09:08.400 --> 1:09:14.040]  up of Bill Hillary and perhaps even Barack Obama himself in terms of the
[1:09:14.040 --> 1:09:19.680]  massive crimes that they have been exposed on in just the last three weeks
[1:09:19.680 --> 1:09:24.600]  and by the way everybody knows we don't pipe stuff here we just lay out the facts
[1:09:24.600 --> 1:09:28.800]  suddenly so I saw the executive order last week and I had you on I had course
[1:09:28.800 --> 1:09:32.120]  and I agree that's where it's going and we the Saudi Arabian deal and all of it
[1:09:32.120 --> 1:09:37.280]  cutting off their money but now not just Smith not just McCabe resigning you
[1:09:37.280 --> 1:09:43.840]  have suddenly hundreds of leftist newspapers CNN the nation you name it
[1:09:43.840 --> 1:09:48.200]  saying it's all a fraud the Russia gate was a fraud it was criminal it was
[1:09:48.200 --> 1:09:52.400]  terrible the Clintons are evil they're finally giving up the ghost I believe at
[1:09:52.400 --> 1:09:56.640]  least on the surface so let's get into their counter-strike or you know we
[1:09:56.640 --> 1:09:59.960]  know they're duplicitous there's no honor amongst thieves but to you the
[1:09:59.960 --> 1:10:04.280]  listeners everybody else I think the age of treachery that we've been in for 50
[1:10:04.280 --> 1:10:07.600]  years is beginning to turn that means there's some utopia we're about to enter
[1:10:07.600 --> 1:10:12.400]  but the age of honor is coming back so here's the sun coming back here is the
[1:10:12.400 --> 1:10:15.520]  light coming back and here's the you Roger Stone the President Trump and our
[1:10:15.520 --> 1:10:20.400]  listeners I salute you all my friend thank you Alex and here's to you and the
[1:10:20.400 --> 1:10:25.800]  entire vanguard at Info Wars because you have been the cutting edge of this
[1:10:25.800 --> 1:10:30.000]  revolution well I don't want to brag about it but the history books have to
[1:10:30.000 --> 1:10:32.520]  be written it's just an example of victory we've both gone through hell
[1:10:32.520 --> 1:10:36.240]  they tried to kill you and they asked you to classify that you were hit with a
[1:10:36.240 --> 1:10:40.360]  polonium and they've tried to destroy everything I've gotten and come pretty
[1:10:40.360 --> 1:10:44.040]  close and you know tried to take my kids away from me it's it's been a serious
[1:10:44.040 --> 1:10:47.160]  but you know what I don't feel I'm not an SJW I don't feel sorry for myself these
[1:10:47.160 --> 1:10:55.480]  scars are my my masterwork I mean this scarred body I love it I love the battle
[1:10:55.480 --> 1:11:00.520]  scars I just love being a man Roger not not a super star not a superman but a
[1:11:00.520 --> 1:11:05.280]  man I mean how good does it feel to see real history now with our fingertips and
[1:11:05.280 --> 1:11:11.040]  our listeners and activist fingertips all over it I mean this is epic that which
[1:11:11.040 --> 1:11:16.840]  does not kill us makes us stronger I have no doubt whatsoever Alex that Donald
[1:11:16.840 --> 1:11:20.920]  Trump could not have been nominated without the support of info wars and
[1:11:20.920 --> 1:11:27.840]  the entire alternative conservative community across the board 2016 was the
[1:11:27.840 --> 1:11:32.280]  year in which the mainstream media lost their stranglehold on the entire
[1:11:32.280 --> 1:11:38.240]  dissemination of political information now they seek I think too late to put the
[1:11:38.240 --> 1:11:45.040]  toothpaste back in the tube but make no mistake about it the the deep state does
[1:11:45.040 --> 1:11:50.480]  intend to counterattack they are not just going to go quietly they are
[1:11:50.480 --> 1:11:56.000]  continuing to plot and scheme against this president now I know with the
[1:11:56.000 --> 1:12:01.840]  president ending the year on a high with his massive tax cut the largest tax
[1:12:01.840 --> 1:12:08.360]  cut in US history and a real surge in the stock market historic lows and
[1:12:08.360 --> 1:12:13.840]  unemployment a boom in the housing market a new confidence in America around
[1:12:13.840 --> 1:12:20.480]  the globe that this will seem far-fetched to some some will scoff and say oh you
[1:12:20.480 --> 1:12:25.960]  fellows are just conspiracy theorists no let me be as clear as I can the 25th
[1:12:25.960 --> 1:12:30.840]  amendment strategy that I have outlined here on info wars is still very much a
[1:12:30.840 --> 1:12:34.480]  foot and that will be accompanied by drugging of his food we'll talk about it
[1:12:34.480 --> 1:12:39.120]  next segment but right now I want to get into the victory with you and then I
[1:12:39.120 --> 1:12:41.240]  want to get into their counter strikes and the big news you're going to be
[1:12:41.240 --> 1:12:44.760]  breaking about losing me leaving the administration next in the big fight
[1:12:44.760 --> 1:12:52.560]  there but what does it mean to have CNN the New York Times the nation and a
[1:12:52.560 --> 1:12:55.400]  but I mean so many papers I can't even list them all I covered them earlier
[1:12:55.400 --> 1:12:59.160]  admitting it's all a fraud it's an attack on free speech I mean some of
[1:12:59.160 --> 1:13:02.480]  these things have you front page here this Russia gate is devolving into an
[1:13:02.480 --> 1:13:06.800]  effort to stigmatize the scent it's got you testifying on Capitol Hill I mean
[1:13:06.800 --> 1:13:10.440]  all of this what does that signify because that's that can't just be playing
[1:13:10.440 --> 1:13:14.360]  possum that I mean suddenly to have hundreds of papers saying we were wrong
[1:13:14.360 --> 1:13:18.240]  Russia gates authoritarian we're sorry I mean I think they're doing it because it
[1:13:18.240 --> 1:13:22.880]  blew up in their face and they know now that they just hope it goes away well
[1:13:22.880 --> 1:13:27.600]  this has been a failed gambit the entire argument that Donald Trump was
[1:13:27.600 --> 1:13:32.360]  assisted in his election by Vladimir Putin and the Russians has collapsed
[1:13:32.360 --> 1:13:37.000]  it's collapsed of its own weight because there is absolutely no evidence
[1:13:37.000 --> 1:13:42.480]  whatsoever that that is the case but it would be a mistake Alex to think that
[1:13:42.480 --> 1:13:48.840]  CNN and the hardcore left the George Soros financed cabal that has run this
[1:13:48.840 --> 1:13:53.440]  country for the last 30 years is going to throw in the towel they can't give up
[1:13:53.440 --> 1:13:59.120]  I see a real difference between responsive responsible yes even
[1:13:59.120 --> 1:14:03.600]  patriotic liberals who are just misguided in their views but who don't
[1:14:03.600 --> 1:14:09.200]  hate America like the some of the folks at the nation who have reached the right
[1:14:09.200 --> 1:14:14.680]  conclusion which is to say the entire Russian charade is an attempt to stifle
[1:14:14.680 --> 1:14:19.600]  free expression and that they've come up empty-handed despite the fact that they
[1:14:19.600 --> 1:14:24.200]  spent sure it is destroying the FBI but but but what what would CNN's if you
[1:14:24.200 --> 1:14:29.000]  seen CNN now has a multiple article saying quote Trump was right about the
[1:14:29.000 --> 1:14:35.320]  FBI that's today what will they say tomorrow in other words I think that is
[1:14:35.320 --> 1:14:40.160]  a tactic rather than a change in strategy and they know that the president is
[1:14:40.160 --> 1:14:45.000]  having a very very strong December to say the least that he's going into the
[1:14:45.000 --> 1:14:49.400]  new year with the wind to his back but they're just leaning on the robes right
[1:14:49.400 --> 1:14:53.360]  now knowing it's killing him to be anti-American recovery so they're just
[1:14:53.360 --> 1:14:57.720]  kind of recessing into the shadows well I have a number of things to report
[1:14:57.720 --> 1:15:02.360]  about the plot that is afoot when we get to the next segment but Alex in the
[1:15:02.360 --> 1:15:07.400]  meantime I really hope that the expansion of info wars can continue and
[1:15:07.400 --> 1:15:11.440]  that folks will go to the info wars store because it's programming just like

[1:20:18.960 --> 1:20:30.560]  From deep in the heart of FEMA Region 6 Austin Texas transmitting worldwide it's
[1:20:30.560 --> 1:20:35.760]  Alex Jones. But see the whole globalist shadow government program can cut both
[1:20:35.760 --> 1:20:39.760]  ways against the New World Order. They wanted to run their operation in
[1:20:39.760 --> 1:20:45.080]  Palakry were running ours. By the way I met with my CPA who's also on a bunch of
[1:20:45.080 --> 1:20:50.200]  boards. The major corporations is one of the top CPAs in Texas. He was very proud
[1:20:50.200 --> 1:20:53.720]  of it and so was I. We're both paying more taxes under the Trump plan because
[1:20:53.720 --> 1:20:58.360]  we're Nouveau-Riche upper-middle class not super wealthy but wealthy successful
[1:20:58.360 --> 1:21:04.560]  and they got rid of the exemption on the property taxes above $10,000 and did a
[1:21:04.560 --> 1:21:08.000]  bunch of other stuff. So yeah I got a two-point cut in income taxes but the
[1:21:08.000 --> 1:21:11.880]  other stuff I'm paying more. I love it. I don't like the globalist fat cat liberals
[1:21:11.880 --> 1:21:14.960]  having 20 million dollar houses and putting all their stuff in that and
[1:21:14.960 --> 1:21:19.800]  paying no tax basically federally with their exemption and so Cuomo and others
[1:21:19.800 --> 1:21:24.440]  are so pissed. You're right all you liberal ultra-rich people you know they
[1:21:24.440 --> 1:21:30.240]  admit liberals in Congress have 70 plus percent of the money. I'm sick of filthy
[1:21:30.240 --> 1:21:35.040]  rich tax-exempt jerks like Bezos that's taxpayer funded with stuff you got
[1:21:35.040 --> 1:21:39.880]  Obama to pass telling a working family making $200,000 a year that they're
[1:21:39.880 --> 1:21:45.680]  rich pigs. They all got big tax cuts and people making $50,000 dead and now all
[1:21:45.680 --> 1:21:50.680]  these bonuses and I love it and I love paying more taxes if it means getting the
[1:21:50.680 --> 1:21:53.760]  country going. Roger Stone what do you say to this and then get into all your
[1:21:53.760 --> 1:21:57.080]  huge news. Now you got a huge news you're in a right shot going caputo coming up
[1:21:57.080 --> 1:22:01.560]  but man just seeing Trump deliver it's just so good after the dark night of
[1:22:01.560 --> 1:22:05.880]  liars but the Democrats and Republican scumbags to see somebody who isn't out
[1:22:05.880 --> 1:22:12.720]  to rape the country. Well Alex I love it when you call Governor Cuomo out because
[1:22:12.720 --> 1:22:18.240]  a very very prominent New Yorker went to Governor Cuomo only days ago and said
[1:22:18.240 --> 1:22:23.160]  look since you no longer have the deductibility of New York's very
[1:22:23.160 --> 1:22:30.120]  high income taxes why not have New York taxpayers pay that money to a tax-free
[1:22:30.120 --> 1:22:35.880]  foundation to a nonprofit which would then give it to the state they could take
[1:22:35.880 --> 1:22:41.040]  the deduction the state would get the money everybody would benefit and the
[1:22:41.040 --> 1:22:46.320]  governor's response was not interested. No he's only interested in trashing
[1:22:46.320 --> 1:22:51.600]  President Trump he's not interested in a true solution and lower taxes for the
[1:22:51.600 --> 1:22:58.040]  people of the Empire State. So Alex I think you hit it right on the head for
[1:22:58.040 --> 1:23:04.160]  the vast majority of working Americans this tax cut is evocative of the tax
[1:23:04.160 --> 1:23:09.880]  cuts of Ronald Reagan John F. Kennedy and we know that a rising tide lifts all
[1:23:09.880 --> 1:23:13.960]  think about Trump how much property he owns this is a huge this is the untold
[1:23:13.960 --> 1:23:16.920]  story I was doing the math last night just know what's available this looks
[1:23:16.920 --> 1:23:19.240]  like he's gonna lose hundreds of millions of dollars a year on right off
[1:23:19.240 --> 1:23:24.160]  himself I mean when I saw that that my taxes actually went up but for working
[1:23:24.160 --> 1:23:28.880]  class and middle class it went down it made me love Trump even more he actually
[1:23:28.880 --> 1:23:33.040]  it's it's it's a it's the ultra rich should be paying more tax he's like the
[1:23:33.040 --> 1:23:37.680]  real Bernie Sanders it's incredible you know and this has some precedent you
[1:23:37.680 --> 1:23:41.240]  know when he thought about running for president in 2000 he put forward a
[1:23:41.240 --> 1:23:46.760]  proposal in which the mega rich would pay more this included himself he knew
[1:23:46.760 --> 1:23:50.920]  that he would be taxing himself greater but he wanted to erase the deficit to
[1:23:50.920 --> 1:23:55.480]  make America stronger that's the kind of selfless patriot Donald Trump is so
[1:23:55.480 --> 1:24:01.280]  yes he will pay more under this plan you and I will play more but the vast
[1:24:01.280 --> 1:24:05.480]  majority of working Americans who voted for Donald Trump are gonna get a tax cut
[1:24:05.480 --> 1:24:10.760]  and the people can dispose of their own money better than the government can you
[1:24:10.760 --> 1:24:14.560]  know it's sick it's suddenly I want to pay my taxes and I never have because
[1:24:14.560 --> 1:24:20.360]  suddenly I feel like it's finally for America at least in the idea well look
[1:24:20.360 --> 1:24:27.600]  I follow the writings of economists like Larry Kudlow and and Steve Moore of the
[1:24:27.600 --> 1:24:31.440]  Heritage Foundation and they've been beating this drum all the way back to
[1:24:31.440 --> 1:24:36.400]  the Trump campaign Donald Trump had from the beginning the most dynamic the most
[1:24:36.400 --> 1:24:42.480]  pro-growth tax proposal of any candidate Republican or Democrat and now low and
[1:24:42.480 --> 1:24:47.000]  behold despite the fact that some in the Congress have added some Christmas tree
[1:24:47.000 --> 1:24:52.480]  provisions he's making it happen this is going to be the the the greatest
[1:24:52.480 --> 1:24:57.080]  economic boom in American history and it's going to turbocharge our economy
[1:24:57.080 --> 1:25:03.360]  which is going to make removing him even harder but that will not in any way
[1:25:03.360 --> 1:25:09.280]  dampen the attempt by the deep state and the two-party duopoly the elites of
[1:25:09.280 --> 1:25:13.600]  both a Republican and Democratic Party who still despite the president's
[1:25:13.600 --> 1:25:18.040]  incredible success want this president gone and let's be clear that I'm gonna
[1:25:18.040 --> 1:25:22.120]  give the big news if you look at the geniuses when the next two years
[1:25:22.120 --> 1:25:27.800]  analyst agree that's gonna put pressure on the blue states debt right off their
[1:25:27.800 --> 1:25:31.760]  income tax super high and right off their property taxes super high that then
[1:25:31.760 --> 1:25:35.080]  balloons it because it's written off it makes people launder money through it
[1:25:35.080 --> 1:25:39.080]  then no money goes to central government then the money only goes to rich
[1:25:39.080 --> 1:25:42.680]  globalists in those states that are riding it off this actually makes them
[1:25:42.680 --> 1:25:46.880]  pay taxes but it'll put pressure for the states now in the cities that do this to
[1:25:46.880 --> 1:25:51.320]  lower taxes to reasonable levels I mean you look at the genius it's like I
[1:25:51.320 --> 1:25:56.720]  think I'm pretty smart Roger but I read this in aftermath now and I go man that
[1:25:56.720 --> 1:26:00.800]  is as bad as some of his advisors are whatever's happening some good stuff's
[1:26:00.800 --> 1:26:05.360]  going on Roger well what the president said in that New York Times interview of
[1:26:05.360 --> 1:26:08.920]  a couple days ago is absolutely right he understands tax policy better than the
[1:26:08.920 --> 1:26:12.800]  economists Alex let's move to the news because I think it's important I don't
[1:26:12.800 --> 1:26:15.880]  know the next segment to this good computers coming up yeah let's get in
[1:26:15.880 --> 1:26:19.120]  just to give us a taste of what's coming on the good the bad the other is
[1:26:19.120 --> 1:26:22.360]  there's some bad news too we got some big news on who's gonna be leaving
[1:26:22.360 --> 1:26:26.600]  but also listen 25th amendment right now though well first let's go to a
[1:26:26.600 --> 1:26:31.840]  question you asked me yesterday because at least three senior administrative
[1:26:31.840 --> 1:26:36.480]  source administration sources told me and I reported here at info wars that
[1:26:36.480 --> 1:26:42.320]  secretary of state Tillerson was leaving around January 1st now suddenly
[1:26:42.320 --> 1:26:47.360]  after a private meeting with a general Mattis and general Kelly well it
[1:26:47.360 --> 1:26:52.280]  appears that mr. Tillerson is staying at least for that time being I don't know
[1:26:52.280 --> 1:26:55.960]  what reason the generals gave the president but I know what their game
[1:26:55.960 --> 1:27:01.840]  plan is they need Tillerson's vote for their 25th amendment takedown they are
[1:27:01.840 --> 1:27:06.240]  head counting anybody who thinks that Mike Pence isn't planning to move into
[1:27:06.240 --> 1:27:11.160]  the big office is wrong his top aide Nick Ayers was caught leaking detrimental
[1:27:11.160 --> 1:27:15.920]  information about the president and rather than fire Ayers his press
[1:27:15.920 --> 1:27:22.080]  secretary Mark lotter an exceptionally able young man took the fall for him so
[1:27:22.080 --> 1:27:26.840]  there are people staying and there are people leaving we will get back into it
[1:27:26.840 --> 1:27:32.400]  in the next segment as you say but I stand by my prediction Tillerson will
[1:27:32.400 --> 1:27:37.360]  stay around long enough to be of use to the deep state let's not forget where
[1:27:37.360 --> 1:27:42.000]  Tillerson came from he was recommended for the secretary of state job by
[1:27:42.000 --> 1:27:48.760]  condo Lisa Rice hardly a Trump supporter exactly I'm just frothing about how good
[1:27:48.760 --> 1:27:53.120]  things are but you're right I mean it's just like McCabe the architect of the
[1:27:53.120 --> 1:27:57.160]  fake Russia gate investigation as the deputy director advised the president
[1:27:57.160 --> 1:28:01.280]  by just Rosenstein to put him in now he's leaving as the president knows he's
[1:28:01.280 --> 1:28:04.880]  a fraud that's an example of how the president's really smart instinct wise
[1:28:04.880 --> 1:28:11.000]  but surrounded on research by bad research putting in globalist around him
[1:28:11.000 --> 1:28:16.400]  well I think he's often Alex not told all the facts in other words they say a
[1:28:16.400 --> 1:28:21.840]  mr. president this is John Smith he had excellent grades in college he's been
[1:28:21.840 --> 1:28:25.640]  endorsed by five Republican US senators that you like he'd be perfect for this
[1:28:25.640 --> 1:28:29.840]  job no one says and oh by the way he's a member of the trilateral Commission and
[1:28:29.840 --> 1:28:33.720]  the council on foreign relations and he worked in the George W. Bush White House
[1:28:33.720 --> 1:28:39.440]  so I think they lied to the president by omission and he's not a political animal
[1:28:39.440 --> 1:28:44.840]  he's a businessman he's a visionary he's a straight shooter we'll be back then on
[1:28:44.840 --> 1:28:48.160]  the 20-foot amendment plan and who's gonna be leaving the administration next
[1:28:48.160 --> 1:28:52.400]  who they plan to replace it with exclusives with Roger Stone and Michael
[1:28:52.400 --> 1:28:55.480]  Caputo straight ahead stay with us
[1:28:55.480 --> 1:29:00.360]  not a group you develop living defense for us it took you over a year to do it why is this so good

[1:33:58.920 --> 1:34:05.840]  so satiated I feel so empowered I feel so good about pushing Trump and going my
[1:34:05.840 --> 1:34:10.680]  gut and everything that's happened in the last 11 months and 10 days it's
[1:34:10.680 --> 1:34:14.640]  amazing Michael Caputo former senior advisor to the Trump campaign have the
[1:34:14.640 --> 1:34:19.120]  New York campaign as well politics at New York net he's been accused being a
[1:34:19.120 --> 1:34:22.400]  Russian agent that whole narrative is falling apart spectacularly we'll get
[1:34:22.400 --> 1:34:25.440]  us taking a moment on what he sees happening in the new year and just
[1:34:25.440 --> 1:34:29.720]  where we're at politically but wow I just feel like if I'm not gushing I'm
[1:34:29.720 --> 1:34:32.920]  not being honest and I'm always just honest but but Roger Stone there are
[1:34:32.920 --> 1:34:37.200]  some poison linings to this give us the intrigue even trying to get to but I
[1:34:37.200 --> 1:34:40.880]  wanted to hold until now about the big resignation you learned about from a
[1:34:40.880 --> 1:34:44.580]  little birdie big exclusive the media all pays attention to your exclusives
[1:34:44.580 --> 1:34:49.800]  because they're 99% of the time accurate your big exclusive and then the
[1:34:49.800 --> 1:34:54.200]  next big shooting drops and the six what should be what should we shouldn't be
[1:34:54.200 --> 1:34:57.720]  too arrogant as the wolf says in Pulp Fiction we shouldn't start you know what
[1:34:57.720 --> 1:35:02.040]  each other yet well what should we be watching for Roger Stone will co-host
[1:35:02.040 --> 1:35:06.020]  here with Michael Caputo here in just a minute well Alex I think you're
[1:35:06.020 --> 1:35:10.720]  absolutely right we should not just assume because of the president is
[1:35:10.720 --> 1:35:16.120]  having these extraordinary successes that it in any way dampens the resolve
[1:35:16.120 --> 1:35:22.400]  of the deep state or taps down the deep enmity they have for both the
[1:35:22.400 --> 1:35:27.640]  president culturally or his policies which are you know nationalist which
[1:35:27.640 --> 1:35:32.840]  are pro-american sovereignty which are pro-american exceptionalism which are
[1:35:32.840 --> 1:35:38.580]  you know a tip of the hat to Americana in the greatness of this country they've
[1:35:38.580 --> 1:35:44.880]  had their way for 30 years they have no intention of relinquishing the steering
[1:35:44.880 --> 1:35:49.720]  wheel to Donald Trump this easily they're still shocked that he pulled off his
[1:35:49.720 --> 1:35:56.720]  most improbable victory in the last election against all odds general John
[1:35:56.720 --> 1:36:03.360]  Kelly whose own personal politics are progressive left and who has sought to
[1:36:03.360 --> 1:36:08.800]  put a cocoon around the president cutting him off from his natural allies in
[1:36:08.800 --> 1:36:15.160]  the conservative and liberty movement is telling intimates that he himself will
[1:36:15.160 --> 1:36:22.440]  leave within three to four months and I think this is the key and the president's
[1:36:22.440 --> 1:36:32.360]  new chief of staff would be Rob Porter of Ohio the Bush quizzling the U.S.
[1:36:32.360 --> 1:36:37.600]  senator member of the trilateral Commission and the Council on Foreign
[1:36:37.600 --> 1:36:43.400]  Relations now I bring this up now and I know that some out there will say oh
[1:36:43.400 --> 1:36:50.680]  this is this is a conspiracy theory let us just see I think it's vital that the
[1:36:50.680 --> 1:36:56.520]  president know who exactly who Rob Porter is and when they say of the
[1:36:56.520 --> 1:37:03.840]  president do they necessarily mean Donald Trump mark my words Alex despite the
[1:37:03.840 --> 1:37:08.280]  fact that we're high-fiving each other right now and that the president is in
[1:37:08.280 --> 1:37:14.440]  an exceptionally good mood having had a great year this is going to come on
[1:37:14.440 --> 1:37:21.000]  fast and furious and it will be vicious you're going to see an uptake in the
[1:37:21.000 --> 1:37:26.800]  Trump is crazy talk you heard it here on info worse first I said it months ago
[1:37:26.800 --> 1:37:32.480]  when the Russian collusion delusion collapses when they are proven to be
[1:37:32.480 --> 1:37:36.240]  completely you said in March you said at March you said because you had the
[1:37:36.240 --> 1:37:40.120]  sources and that's where I want to go next with with with a you and Michael
[1:37:40.120 --> 1:37:47.080]  Caputo politics in why net is that why is the New York Times Michael Caputo why
[1:37:47.080 --> 1:37:51.040]  is the all these publications saying okay Russia gates fake the FBI is in
[1:37:51.040 --> 1:37:55.560]  trouble we admit it's a fraud let's just leave it alone why are they
[1:37:55.560 --> 1:37:59.600]  signaling that all over the place the last four or five days my caputo what
[1:37:59.600 --> 1:38:03.680]  do you make of that being a former top Trump advisor and then other other big
[1:38:03.680 --> 1:38:06.880]  issues you're the expert here what other information you want to impart to the
[1:38:06.880 --> 1:38:11.440]  listeners about where we are right now in this war to retake America from the
[1:38:11.440 --> 1:38:16.000]  globalist it's interesting I think frankly that it was always going to end
[1:38:16.000 --> 1:38:21.800]  this way the Russia Trump collusion delusion was always going to come apart
[1:38:21.800 --> 1:38:26.080]  and I think they you know the left is probably high-fiving themselves that
[1:38:26.080 --> 1:38:30.560]  they were able to keep that ball in the air as long as they were were able to
[1:38:30.560 --> 1:38:35.600]  you know frankly this is all been about a very important agenda on the left that
[1:38:35.600 --> 1:38:39.800]  is they're going to destroy Donald Trump they're gonna destroy his family
[1:38:39.800 --> 1:38:44.440]  they're gonna destroy his businesses and they're gonna destroy his friends
[1:38:44.440 --> 1:38:50.040]  because God forbid in 10 years or 15 years another American minded
[1:38:50.040 --> 1:38:55.000]  billionaire comes forward and says honey I can fix this I think I need to run
[1:38:55.000 --> 1:38:59.240]  for president they want that person to have a second thought look what they
[1:38:59.240 --> 1:39:03.800]  did to Trump and his family and his businesses and his friends and I think
[1:39:03.800 --> 1:39:08.320]  they've taken this Russia collusion delusion as far down the track as they
[1:39:08.320 --> 1:39:12.520]  could you know Alex when I was working with the president during the campaign
[1:39:12.520 --> 1:39:17.840]  there was a point when I when there was a signal to me I thought that the
[1:39:17.840 --> 1:39:23.520]  Hillary side of the of the campaign had cracked the code had figured out how to
[1:39:23.520 --> 1:39:29.680]  get Donald Trump and that was to insult him to insult his family or to insult
[1:39:29.680 --> 1:39:35.480]  his businesses in an unreasonable and an unseemly way have that advanced by the
[1:39:35.480 --> 1:39:40.200]  media and he would get angry and make mistakes we saw that time and again
[1:39:40.200 --> 1:39:45.400]  tried on him during the campaign and occasionally it succeeded what they've
[1:39:45.400 --> 1:39:49.680]  done here is as we saw in the book Shattered which was written about the
[1:39:49.680 --> 1:39:53.920]  time after the election the Clinton team decided that they were going to have
[1:39:53.920 --> 1:40:00.720]  this Russia collusion delusion as their front line as their first story and try
[1:40:00.720 --> 1:40:04.680]  to put the president in a situation where he would mess up and in this
[1:40:04.680 --> 1:40:09.920]  circumstance perhaps commit obstruction and I think they're satisfied that they
[1:40:09.920 --> 1:40:15.960]  moved the ball so far as they have what do you make of them then suddenly coming
[1:40:15.960 --> 1:40:19.400]  out and saying okay it's a fraud okay I mean is that just them hedging their
[1:40:19.400 --> 1:40:22.680]  bets because they realized them the public isn't buying into it because now
[1:40:22.680 --> 1:40:26.880]  all these documents have come out and the admissions of like 26 people in the
[1:40:26.880 --> 1:40:31.520]  FBI Justice Department colluding to make all this up it's interesting Alex I
[1:40:31.520 --> 1:40:34.880] 'd love to hear what Roger has to say I haven't had a chance to talk to him
[1:40:34.880 --> 1:40:39.080]  about this but the big blockbuster nothing burger in the New York Times
[1:40:39.080 --> 1:40:45.000]  about Papadopoulos that came out this weekend I can't quite figure out trying
[1:40:45.000 --> 1:40:49.760]  to read the tea leaves why they would break this story on New Year's Eve
[1:40:49.760 --> 1:40:55.680]  weekend which I believe is perhaps the the worst weekend of the year to break
[1:40:55.680 --> 1:41:01.280]  news I wonder what Roger take that let me take a shot at this here's the thing I
[1:41:01.280 --> 1:41:06.680]  think it's important to understand the globalists always have a plan a and a
[1:41:06.680 --> 1:41:13.960]  plan B and a plan C plan a has been a limited success in the sense that they
[1:41:13.960 --> 1:41:20.040]  have tied the president up for over a year over nothing and sadly a substantial
[1:41:20.040 --> 1:41:25.120]  number of Americans thank God a minority still believe that the Kremlin
[1:41:25.120 --> 1:41:29.320]  somehow tried to help Donald Trump get elected despite the fact that they turned
[1:41:29.320 --> 1:41:34.720]  up no evidence whatsoever or that all three of us work for the Kremlin and they
[1:41:34.720 --> 1:41:41.040]  have taken they accused us of being Russian agents they accused info wars
[1:41:41.040 --> 1:41:47.760]  of using Russian bots to to post our links complete nonsense they take a
[1:41:47.760 --> 1:41:52.440]  completely innocent and totally legal meeting by Donald Trump Jr. and they
[1:41:52.440 --> 1:41:56.800]  try to make it a criminal conspiracy or at a minimum a campaign finance
[1:41:56.800 --> 1:42:02.880]  violation it is neither but they are abandoning plan a it's over we're now
[1:42:02.880 --> 1:42:10.120]  moving to plan B plan B is a removal under the 25th amendment a bogus claim
[1:42:10.120 --> 1:42:15.440]  as you said you Kelly and others it was to lionize them you think your sources

[1:47:09.400 --> 1:47:18.320]  live from Austin Texas broadcasting worldwide it's alex jones
[1:47:18.320 --> 1:47:28.640]  don't try it on me I got to tell you this is an amazing final broadcast in 2017
[1:47:28.640 --> 1:47:35.200]  and we're so accustomed to evil and corruption to just see a president that's
[1:47:35.200 --> 1:47:38.920]  not out to get us is actually trying to turn the country back on and trying to
[1:47:38.920 --> 1:47:43.320]  be fair is amazing so I really asked Michael Caputo former top Trump
[1:47:43.320 --> 1:47:46.520]  advisor and of course Roger Stone former head of his campaign to just take
[1:47:46.520 --> 1:47:50.960]  over this final segment as they pause I'll run rampant here and just give us
[1:47:50.960 --> 1:47:54.360]  other tidbits and I said Caputo and Stone we'll talk about they said well
[1:47:54.360 --> 1:48:02.240]  what's next in diamond a jury Kushner but also midterms 2018 because 2017 2016
[1:48:02.240 --> 1:48:06.840]  our beachhead 2018 key say what you want about Roy Moore he got the elections
[1:48:06.840 --> 1:48:09.800]  stolen from him that's been proven I think election fraud is going to be the
[1:48:09.800 --> 1:48:13.040]  key to what they do so guys put them a free for all for the 10 minutes we have
[1:48:13.040 --> 1:48:20.520]  left here all right well I'm happy to dive in look I think Mueller has had as
[1:48:20.520 --> 1:48:26.280]  bad a month of December as the president had good his entire probe is
[1:48:26.280 --> 1:48:31.480]  exposed as the partisan witch hunt that he is that it is his hit squad is
[1:48:31.480 --> 1:48:37.960]  exposed as as exactly that and now the only way that he can regain the upper
[1:48:37.960 --> 1:48:44.680]  hand is through the guilty play of General Mike Flynn who I believe is a
[1:48:44.680 --> 1:48:50.480]  great great patriot Flynn has been jammed up in a process crime there's
[1:48:50.480 --> 1:48:55.160]  nothing illegal or improper regarding his outreach to the Russians to set up a
[1:48:55.160 --> 1:48:58.760]  meeting in case you haven't been paying attention folks the Russians have
[1:48:58.760 --> 1:49:05.040]  thermonuclear weapons not speaking to them would be very very dangerous but
[1:49:05.040 --> 1:49:10.480]  we do know that that Flynn has said publicly that a senior member of the
[1:49:10.480 --> 1:49:15.240]  president's transition team instructed him to reach out to the Russian
[1:49:15.240 --> 1:49:21.720]  ambassador that can only be mr. Kushner let me stress again even if even if
[1:49:21.720 --> 1:49:27.120]  Jared Kushner did do that that's a perfectly appropriate legal function of
[1:49:27.120 --> 1:49:32.640]  the transition and a counselor to the president yet we know that the FBI has
[1:49:32.640 --> 1:49:39.080]  grilled Kushner for hours and therefore the question becomes do they try to jam
[1:49:39.080 --> 1:49:45.000]  him up with some kind of process crime like they did with Flynn in an attempt
[1:49:45.000 --> 1:49:51.960]  to inflame the president and induce the president to fire Mueller or perhaps to
[1:49:51.960 --> 1:49:56.480]  pardon both Kushner and Flynn well clearly that was their admitted plan
[1:49:56.480 --> 1:50:00.480]  they've telegraphed it with all their talking points on CNN but now Michael
[1:50:00.480 --> 1:50:04.880]  Caputo it seems to be blowing up as it's I mean even mainstream publications
[1:50:04.880 --> 1:50:09.200]  admit it's all a frame-up of Trump I mean are they crazy enough to go forward
[1:50:09.200 --> 1:50:14.600]  with us what comes next well I think it's interesting I don't just count the
[1:50:14.600 --> 1:50:17.880]  tea leaves that are there I look for the ones that aren't there and you know
[1:50:17.880 --> 1:50:21.920]  what's not there after all these stories about what Flynn did and what the
[1:50:21.920 --> 1:50:28.800]  coffee boy Papadopoulos did we've seen very little about Jared Kushner and the
[1:50:28.800 --> 1:50:32.960]  question you know we also see that the Kushner and his legal team were out
[1:50:32.960 --> 1:50:38.600]  shopping for a public relations firm so it appears they are looking you know
[1:50:38.600 --> 1:50:43.240]  forward into 2018 and seeing a more serious fight on their hands as well so
[1:50:43.240 --> 1:50:47.160]  the lack of absolutely they plan to indict Kushner next I don't think I've got
[1:50:47.160 --> 1:50:51.960]  the way most to do it to Donald Jr. so so yeah I keep going yeah I just think
[1:50:51.960 --> 1:50:56.160]  the lack of news on Kushner shows to me that he's probably his time in the
[1:50:56.160 --> 1:51:00.640]  barrel is coming in this new year and that's unfortunate but you know he
[1:51:00.640 --> 1:51:05.280]  appears to be their new target we also see in this New York Times story as many
[1:51:05.280 --> 1:51:10.520]  errors as I saw in it we also see that Papadopoulos was somebody who was
[1:51:10.520 --> 1:51:14.800]  running absolutely a muck and if you believe what the New York Times is
[1:51:14.800 --> 1:51:19.760]  saying he was doing things that were you know and the one thing that's the I'm
[1:51:19.760 --> 1:51:23.960]  sorry the two things that are very much missing from that New York Times story
[1:51:23.960 --> 1:51:29.240]  is there's no mention of anyone who carried his water to the president or
[1:51:29.240 --> 1:51:32.760]  that he actually connected well yeah he's like this low-level guy that keeps
[1:51:32.760 --> 1:51:36.960]  going let's meet with the Russians like shut up Russians they don't matter it's
[1:51:36.960 --> 1:51:40.160]  like hundreds of times he was obvious it looks to me like he was a plan for the
[1:51:40.160 --> 1:51:43.120]  beginning I mean you read those transcripts does it not look like he's a
[1:51:43.120 --> 1:51:50.120]  plant from the beginning or he's just or he's just stupid let's be clear he's a
[1:51:50.120 --> 1:51:56.120]  volunteer he has no authority he's not on the payroll he doesn't have a past
[1:51:56.120 --> 1:51:59.280]  sure but he's like a wind-up doll he just goes meet with the Russians meet with
[1:51:59.280 --> 1:52:03.720]  the Russians meet and they're like shut up kid Russians aren't do yeah I mean
[1:52:03.720 --> 1:52:07.400]  it's like there's nothing there some of the interesting parts of the story were
[1:52:07.400 --> 1:52:11.560]  that it was very clear from the New York Times story that everybody in the
[1:52:11.560 --> 1:52:18.040]  campaign thought this guy was stupid that he was a foolishly enthusiastic and
[1:52:18.040 --> 1:52:22.200]  that he had in terrible ideas and it comes through in the story as well I
[1:52:22.200 --> 1:52:27.560]  think they also in that story said that sessions I believe it was wanted to move
[1:52:27.560 --> 1:52:31.560]  away from his ideas because there was no way if they were ever gonna meet with
[1:52:31.560 --> 1:52:35.520]  the Russians that they would do so through the auspices of a young and
[1:52:35.520 --> 1:52:40.640]  inexperienced person like Papadopoulos so some of it exactly that's the meetings
[1:52:40.640 --> 1:52:44.440]  I'm saying where sessions is like yeah Russians what it's like it's like
[1:52:44.440 --> 1:52:50.600]  talking about you know just random crap but let's play it out here see what they
[1:52:50.600 --> 1:52:56.000]  would like to have happened is the president first of all it's not inconsistent
[1:52:56.000 --> 1:53:00.560]  because the indictment of Kushner would be not related to Russian collusion it
[1:53:00.560 --> 1:53:05.920]  would be related to lying to the FBI right then they hope that the president
[1:53:05.920 --> 1:53:12.160]  will overreact and fire Mueller this is their briar patch strategy they are so
[1:53:12.160 --> 1:53:18.040]  naked please throw out congresswoman Jackie Spire rhymes with liar running
[1:53:18.040 --> 1:53:23.440]  around saying all the rumors everywhere Trump is gonna fire Mueller they want
[1:53:23.440 --> 1:53:27.120]  him to fire so let me ask you both let me ask let me ask my computer here's we
[1:53:27.120 --> 1:53:31.440]  in this year's transmissions clearly it's falling apart what how do they
[1:53:31.440 --> 1:53:37.920]  extricate themselves with face-saving or is all this face-saving a ploy for what
[1:53:37.920 --> 1:53:41.200]  they're really about to do with Russia gate is it dead or does it still have
[1:53:41.200 --> 1:53:46.180]  legs my computer I think that the the House and Senate investigations the
[1:53:46.180 --> 1:53:50.280]  multiple investigations over in Congress there are gonna wind down you'll see a
[1:53:50.280 --> 1:53:54.840]  representative smear and representatives shift spending a lot of time
[1:53:54.840 --> 1:53:58.480]  screaming about it to the press because they've gotten a free ride in the
[1:53:58.480 --> 1:54:02.480]  media for quite some time I believe we'll see Mueller's investigation wind
[1:54:02.480 --> 1:54:07.520]  down necessarily to with maybe even some more process crimes accused and
[1:54:07.520 --> 1:54:11.240]  prosecuted but in the end I think the net that they're gonna they're gonna
[1:54:11.240 --> 1:54:15.160]  come up with is this gonna have one Papadopoulos in it and nobody else
[1:54:15.160 --> 1:54:19.600]  because I believe man important gates are gonna break free of these allegations
[1:54:19.600 --> 1:54:24.720]  and I believe General Flynn when we find out which what what agents struck did
[1:54:24.720 --> 1:54:29.800]  and how he tricked him into this and this alleged interview where he lied I
[1:54:29.800 --> 1:54:35.040]  think though that's gonna come out in the wash as well I totally agree but you
[1:54:35.040 --> 1:54:37.440]  know they never give up even though they're getting their ass kicked
[1:54:37.440 --> 1:54:41.240]  politically you name it if America doesn't roll over like Bernie Sanders
[1:54:41.240 --> 1:54:44.440]  did when they stole the nomination when Hillary did we're gonna win but if we
[1:54:44.440 --> 1:54:48.440]  roll over that's the bottom line you know I had the crew run out to the local
[1:54:48.440 --> 1:54:52.280]  grocery store to get a bottle of champagne here at the end because I
[1:54:52.280 --> 1:54:56.280]  didn't have any alcohol when Roger was drinking his dry martini but to Mike
[1:54:56.280 --> 1:55:00.640]  Caputo and Roger Stone and Donald Trump and our listeners most importantly we're
[1:55:00.640 --> 1:55:05.000]  not perfect but we're not out to screw you over we're not out to set up some you
[1:55:05.000 --> 1:55:09.600]  know Venezuelan or North Korea because we're a bunch of you know one inch you
[1:55:09.600 --> 1:55:13.320]  know what long people that everybody so happy new year to everybody I want to
[1:55:13.320 --> 1:55:17.200]  give you both a one-minute comment here at the end but to my crew and all you
[1:55:17.200 --> 1:55:21.320]  and listeners I love you and I am so proud to be associated with people that
[1:55:21.320 --> 1:55:26.000]  are pro-freedom and pro-america so to all of you to mr. Caputo and mr. mr.
[1:55:26.000 --> 1:55:30.200]  Stone and the great crew here God bless you gentlemen each of you mr. Caputo
[1:55:30.200 --> 1:55:36.680]  first one minute final comment here as we go into 2018 well 2017 has been has
[1:55:36.680 --> 1:55:40.520]  been hell for a lot of people it's been difficult in a lot of ways but we sure
[1:55:40.520 --> 1:55:45.280]  came out of it strong I've always known Donald Trump to finish strong when he's
[1:55:45.280 --> 1:55:51.280]  in midst of a difficult business battle and he ended 2017 I think with one for
[1:55:51.280 --> 1:55:56.720]  the record books with what he did with regulations cutting 900 plus regulations
[1:55:56.720 --> 1:56:01.800]  installing Gora Sipsch and a dozen appeals court justices he's achieved
[1:56:01.800 --> 1:56:05.720]  more in one year than many presidents have in their first year and he comes out
[1:56:05.720 --> 1:56:10.320]  of it depending upon what poll you believe with just about the same poll
[1:56:10.320 --> 1:56:15.200]  rating the Barack Obama did in his first year that doesn't sound great to me
[1:56:15.200 --> 1:56:20.760]  though because in my book 2018 is gonna be a big challenge we can get there the
[1:56:20.760 --> 1:56:25.720]  campaign geniuses in Washington have to come to terms with some unfortunate
[1:56:25.720 --> 1:56:31.840]  facts but what they can't do and they should never do is let's say abandon
[1:56:31.840 --> 1:56:37.000]  and kick out of the party the the band and the the bright parts the info wars
[1:56:37.000 --> 1:56:42.440]  the box news the grassroots the people who elected exactly we've got a huge
