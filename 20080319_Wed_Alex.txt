[00:09.240 --> 00:38.320]  network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones welcome my friends welcome
[00:38.320 --> 00:49.240]  it is March 19 2008 I barely made it into my broadcast cockpit here because
[00:49.240 --> 00:54.200]  we're busy on the phone with a scared lady in East Austin the police came to
[00:54.200 --> 00:57.760]  her door in military uniforms looks like the military is out there with them
[00:57.760 --> 01:02.920]  and said don't worry it's just a training operation and from what we got
[01:02.920 --> 01:10.600]  over the phone it's the classic lockdown grid we know the city of Austin's been
[01:10.600 --> 01:14.120]  training with the military to drive hundreds of buses and take citizens to
[01:14.120 --> 01:19.400]  the emergency relocation center that they built the old airport in 99 they've
[01:19.400 --> 01:24.160]  built these in every major town even most small towns it's all part of our
[01:24.160 --> 01:31.000]  journey into absolute despotism and the destruction of all freedom we have a
[01:31.000 --> 01:37.840]  huge radio broadcast lined up for you today I am so upset about what has
[01:37.840 --> 01:43.640]  developed and about what has happened that despite the fact that I didn't get
[01:43.640 --> 01:49.520]  home until midnight last night from work and despite the fact that I've even
[01:49.520 --> 01:55.000]  cut out caffeine products 99% out of my diet I still a little chocolate or drink
[01:55.000 --> 02:01.720]  glass iced tea or so once a week I could not sleep I woke up probably 20 30
[02:01.720 --> 02:08.080]  times during the night and I ended up waking up at about 5 30 and going back
[02:08.080 --> 02:14.440]  to sleep at about 7 this morning for an hour I can't even sleep over what's
[02:14.440 --> 02:21.480]  happened in the news and information that we have for you today we told you it
[02:21.480 --> 02:29.480]  was going to happen and I take no pleasure in being right again I got home
[02:29.480 --> 02:37.120]  last night at about midnight I went in to do some more news hounding and I saw
[02:37.120 --> 02:41.880]  an info wars dot com the headline individual right to bear arms wins
[02:41.880 --> 02:47.080]  favor in court agreement a link to the New York Law Journal and before I
[02:47.080 --> 02:51.520]  clicked on the link I said it will announce a big victory for gun owners
[02:51.520 --> 02:58.000]  and then it will say but they can have reasonable restrictions and can restrict
[02:58.000 --> 03:08.720]  under law which is not a victory it is the end of the second amendment it is it
[03:08.720 --> 03:17.680]  is absolute despotism and sure enough I read the New York Law Journal I read the
[03:17.680 --> 03:28.720]  Washington Post and then I spent another hour scanning over hundreds of pages
[03:28.720 --> 03:42.480]  well to be accurate the main brief is 91 pages with another 20 something pages of
[03:42.480 --> 03:52.200]  footnotes entered in as evidence into the record and I read the brief the
[03:52.200 --> 04:01.480]  supposed pro second amendment argument and they are even saying oh go ahead and
[04:01.480 --> 04:05.840]  restrict yes you're allowed to and the other side is calling for absolute gun
[04:05.840 --> 04:12.840]  bans the White House actually says we should be able to ban all handguns I
[04:12.840 --> 04:19.200]  mean there it is they want to ban your handguns there's thousands of facets of
[04:19.200 --> 04:28.000]  this I couldn't sleep and now I am struggling not to explode again
[04:28.000 --> 04:34.240]  frustration thousands of facets I want to go over so many different issues their
[04:34.240 --> 04:39.080]  tactics of lying the big issue here is this is being heralded as a victory for
[04:39.080 --> 04:47.080]  the second amendment to make you stand down it's a military tactic it's an art

[09:04.960 --> 09:12.240]  banner a symbol of your stock and trade of your identity that was built into you
[09:12.240 --> 09:18.160]  from public school and college and peer pressure and the sick new order culture
[09:18.160 --> 09:26.520]  that guns themselves cause wars that guns themselves are bullying wicked
[09:26.520 --> 09:35.600]  engines of abuse and degradation of humanity no evil people evil governments
[09:35.600 --> 09:43.560]  evil elites evil organizations seek to always use overwhelming force of arms to
[09:43.560 --> 09:54.160]  dominate individuals groups countries races and where there is the second
[09:54.160 --> 09:58.200]  amendment and individual ownership of weapons there is liberty where there is
[09:58.200 --> 10:06.520]  not there is tyranny Hitler was for gun control Stalin was for quote gun
[10:06.520 --> 10:10.640]  control which itself is a psychologically packaged word you're not
[10:10.640 --> 10:15.760]  for gun control don't you want to control things what you want to control a gun
[10:15.760 --> 10:21.960]  like it has feet of its own and walks out and we hear about gun crime gun
[10:21.960 --> 10:27.840]  murder it's all implied like guns or wicked 10-foot
[10:27.840 --> 10:34.120]  Grendels stalking the countryside devouring children at midnight I have
[10:34.120 --> 10:37.840]  studied this issue I have read the Federalist papers the anti-Federalist
[10:37.840 --> 10:41.040]  papers I have gone and got the original newsprint of the founding fathers
[10:41.040 --> 10:47.360]  having debates in the newspapers not as at the Continental Congress but right
[10:47.360 --> 10:53.800]  through until the nation was actually officially formed and Congress
[10:53.800 --> 11:00.240]  established more than a decade later there are not hundreds there are
[11:00.240 --> 11:08.360]  thousands and thousands of sourced quotes of the founding fathers saying
[11:08.360 --> 11:12.400]  that when the government comes wanting to restrict your second amendment your
[11:12.400 --> 11:16.960]  ownership of individual firearms in any way that is tyranny overthrow that
[11:16.960 --> 11:23.840]  government immediately you it is not your right it is an absolute order from
[11:23.840 --> 11:27.840]  the founding fathers from common sense from the Bill of Rights from the
[11:27.840 --> 11:37.720]  Constitution there is no debating it a strong body makes the mind strong as to
[11:37.720 --> 11:42.680]  the species of exercises I advise the gun while this gives moderate exercise
[11:42.680 --> 11:49.280]  the body it gives boldness enterprise and independence to the mind games played
[11:49.280 --> 11:53.400]  with the ball and others of that nature are often too violent for the body and
[11:53.400 --> 11:58.400]  stamp no character on the mind let your gun therefore be your constant companion
[11:58.400 --> 12:04.840]  of your walks Thomas Jefferson letter to Peter Carr 1785 in the writings of
[12:04.840 --> 12:14.200]  Thomas Jefferson Memorial Edition issued by the trust of Thomas Jefferson one
[12:14.200 --> 12:19.640]  loves to possess arms although they hope never to have to have occasion for them
[12:19.640 --> 12:24.160]  Thomas Jefferson in George Washington 1796 the writings of Thomas Jefferson
[12:24.160 --> 12:33.520]  Memorial Edition we established however some although not all itself government
[12:33.520 --> 12:38.280]  important principles the Constitution of our states asserts that all power is
[12:38.280 --> 12:43.080]  inherent in the people that they may exercise it by themselves in all cases
[12:43.080 --> 12:47.000]  to which they think themselves competent as in their electing their
[12:47.000 --> 12:51.920]  functionaries executive and legislative notice their functionaries not their
[12:51.920 --> 12:56.440]  officials their authorities their bosses see American people think you
[12:56.440 --> 13:01.400]  grovel the government it's God and it directs you and they wear fancy uniforms
[13:01.400 --> 13:07.240]  and fancy plume outfits like they always did in history the more tyrannical
[13:07.240 --> 13:13.160]  government the more plumes and names and titles and finery as your journey
[13:13.160 --> 13:20.760]  towards despotism nears completion that they may exercise it by themselves in
[13:20.760 --> 13:29.280]  all cases which they think themselves competent and it goes on and deciding by
[13:29.280 --> 13:33.720]  a jury of themselves in all judiciary cases in which any fact is involved or
[13:33.720 --> 13:38.360]  they may act by representatives freely and equally chosen that is their right
[13:38.360 --> 13:47.600]  in duty to be at all times armed and death so he ends Thomas Jefferson to
[13:47.600 --> 13:58.280]  John Cartwright 1824 Memorial Edition limbs cone and Brie editors now he's
[13:58.280 --> 14:02.320]  saying it's our right through voting our right through juries grand juries and
[14:02.320 --> 14:11.240]  our right by the gun we run this government it all comes from us no free
[14:11.240 --> 14:16.720]  man shall ever be debarred the use of arms Thomas Jefferson draft Virginia
[14:16.720 --> 14:27.120]  Constitution 1776 that's when Virginia pulled out first ladies and gentlemen by
[14:27.120 --> 14:35.360]  themselves up against the entire British Empire started there and they said you
[14:35.360 --> 14:50.040]  know what you just come and take it and it goes on and on and on and on hundreds
[14:50.040 --> 14:55.080]  and hundreds and hundreds of second amendment quotes that I have here's John
[14:55.080 --> 14:59.160]  Adams because there's page after page of each founding father they defense the
[14:59.160 --> 15:05.440]  Constitution of the United States written by John Adams page 475 people hear
[15:05.440 --> 15:08.440]  John Adams they don't even know who that is they can't find the US on a map
[15:08.440 --> 15:11.320]  that's why the cops and the government can tell you you don't have a second
[15:11.320 --> 15:14.960]  amendment because the public doesn't know their head from the home the ground
[15:14.960 --> 15:19.560]  I'm gonna walk through all this today the Supreme Court is going to ban your
[15:19.560 --> 15:28.120]  guns and just like at Waco and they're ramming those tanks in there and setting
[15:28.120 --> 15:31.320]  that place on fire they were had bullhorn saying this is not an assault
[15:31.320 --> 15:35.600]  this is not an assault and then there's the FLIR footage from the FBI's own
[15:35.600 --> 15:42.640]  planes showing them firing their automatic weapons the Delta Force this is
[15:42.640 --> 15:46.480]  not an assault where you see on the FLIR the people running out the back and
[15:46.480 --> 15:53.160]  being shot and falling down and the Supreme Court saying oh you won you got
[15:53.160 --> 15:59.400]  a second amendment unless we say so you ever seen the United Nations Universal
[15:59.400 --> 16:05.160]  Declaration of Human Rights they're quote global law article 29 and 30 say
[16:05.160 --> 16:09.800]  you have no rights now the first 28 say you have just every right under the
[16:09.800 --> 16:19.040]  sun until it says unless we say so and how did I know they were gonna do this
[16:19.040 --> 16:25.880]  how did I know I watched their official policy Bush comes out during the 2004
[16:25.880 --> 16:32.600]  election and says we have a second amendment right and then he adds unless
[16:32.600 --> 16:39.720]  prescribed by law and I watch what the Republican courts have been doing
[16:39.720 --> 16:43.640]  they were setting us up the Democrats are openly want our guns to feed on us
[16:43.640 --> 16:48.640]  it's all well over the same foreign banks the Republicans you know they've
[16:48.640 --> 16:52.520]  got a seducing nation of gun owners a hundred and forty million hundred and
[16:52.520 --> 16:58.880]  fifty million gun owners they've got a fool you and I'm seeing type gun control
[16:58.880 --> 17:07.360]  into Google web Google news look at it hundreds of articles hundreds where
[17:07.360 --> 17:13.320]  they're going man huge victory oh my gosh the Supreme Court it looks like
[17:13.320 --> 17:16.920]  because these are just reports on observations of what the justices were
[17:16.920 --> 17:20.680]  saying and questions they were saying after you know hours of both sides
[17:20.680 --> 17:24.960]  presenting quote their evidence one of the most important Supreme Court cases
[17:24.960 --> 17:30.760]  ever in our history and they just spend a few hours on it and now they're gonna
[17:30.760 --> 17:33.920]  spend the next few months behind closed doors being told what to do by the
[17:33.920 --> 17:42.240]  political masters that put these judiciary whores in power but they
[17:42.240 --> 17:46.160]  basically said what they're gonna rule yesterday and that is we can ban any
[17:46.160 --> 17:53.240]  gun we want whenever we want and we're gonna take your guns and how is this
[17:53.240 --> 18:01.000]  being spun oh great victory this is not an assault and you run out of the
[18:01.000 --> 18:06.320]  burning building and there's infantry train troops on both sides at the back
[18:06.320 --> 18:11.480]  of the Bradley fighting vehicles opening up on you with their fully
[18:11.480 --> 18:19.200]  automatic rifles video flare footage FBI aircraft and the national media says
[18:19.200 --> 18:23.520]  that's not it's quite normal to have those flashes off the ends of guns that's
[18:23.520 --> 18:32.520]  just reflections that's not a gun flash see they even tell you that's not an
[18:32.520 --> 18:35.800]  assault they were telling the dividends it wasn't an assault as they were shooting
[18:35.800 --> 18:39.160]  them but see when you see the video of them shooting them they say well that's
[18:39.160 --> 18:45.320]  not what you're seeing then the Delta Force documents get released in
[18:45.320 --> 18:50.240]  Congress that they indeed did kill them and it's never in one newspaper oh yeah
[18:50.240 --> 18:55.520]  it's admitted they went in and killed them and went in with an infantry
[18:55.520 --> 18:59.080]  maneuver and went into the church records vault a little concrete structure
[18:59.080 --> 19:03.360]  in there and put a satchel shape-charge bomb in there to send the
[19:03.360 --> 19:06.680]  directed energy down into the church vault with women and children were
[19:06.680 --> 19:12.200]  hiding and it turned them all into a stew it was just a stew splattered them all
[19:12.200 --> 19:18.680]  up against the walls this is not an assault and the Supreme Court ooh big
[19:18.680 --> 19:24.520]  victory for God honors and then you stand down oldest trick in the book
[19:24.520 --> 19:30.600]  when did the Vietnamese Communist attack bearing the Ted holiday when there
[19:30.600 --> 19:36.560]  was a ceasefire they tell you ceasefire they tell you you're winning as they
[19:36.560 --> 19:40.960]  slit your throat ear to ear and the lifeblood of this country and our
[19:40.960 --> 19:46.680]  heritage and everything we are sprays out in black gouts all over the ground
[19:46.680 --> 19:52.160]  and you got that stupid smirk on your face

[19:59.160 --> 20:03.800]  presently accepted methods you are not correctly attacking the cancer and you
[20:03.800 --> 20:08.880]  are mostly fighting to survive the treatment do you realize that mutilating
[20:08.880 --> 20:14.320]  surgery burning and the poisoning of your entire system are totally unnecessary

[24:13.440 --> 24:17.760]  have them on video the founding fathers are bad who do you side with the founding
[24:17.760 --> 24:26.440]  fathers are these shaved head tattooed BATF criminals before a standing army can
[24:26.440 --> 24:33.640]  rule the people must be disarmed as they are in almost every kingdom in Europe the
[24:33.640 --> 24:39.400]  supreme power in America cannot enforce unjust laws by the sword because the
[24:39.400 --> 24:44.240]  whole body of the people are armed and constitute a force superior to any band
[24:44.240 --> 24:49.160]  of regular troops that can be on any pretense raised in the United States a
[24:49.160 --> 24:55.920]  military force at the command of Congress can execute no laws but such as
[24:55.920 --> 25:01.720]  the people perceived to be just and constitutional for they will possess the
[25:01.720 --> 25:10.000]  power and jealously will instantly inspire the inclination to resist the
[25:10.000 --> 25:17.760]  execution of law which appears to them unjust and oppressive there's a founding
[25:17.760 --> 25:22.240]  father and I've got every one of them saying the same thing these guns are
[25:22.240 --> 25:31.880]  for the government they're always the threat they're always the enemy always
[25:31.880 --> 25:36.320]  and the greatest military force of a government ever assembled has been
[25:36.320 --> 25:41.960]  assembled against us the police have been brainwashed have been turned over
[25:41.960 --> 25:46.920]  their special weapons and tactics teams have been turned over to the new world
[25:46.920 --> 25:51.760]  order the BATF has always been critical criminal back from the days that they
[25:51.760 --> 25:55.080]  would rape your wives and steal everything you had if they caught you
[25:55.080 --> 26:00.160]  running a still and selling tack whiskey without paying taxes to them they're the
[26:00.160 --> 26:07.400]  oldest federal police force and a criminal wickedness untold if you they
[26:07.400 --> 26:13.400]  triple the size of the BATF because the new reign of terror against the Second
[26:13.400 --> 26:17.760]  Amendment is beginning you type gun control into Google News hundreds of
[26:17.760 --> 26:21.760]  stories and almost every one of them is a defeat for the Second Amendment state
[26:21.760 --> 26:29.160]  city county international lawsuits Republican Democratic governors suing
[26:29.160 --> 26:34.920]  manufacturers making them stamp the casings total control harassing gun
[26:34.920 --> 26:40.280]  owners just ravaging us raiding gun dealers raiding gun owners harassing
[26:40.280 --> 26:47.720]  veterans banning hundreds of thousands of veterans a month from owning guns but
[26:47.720 --> 26:51.080]  the enemy had more hubris when it came to the Second Amendment five ten years
[26:51.080 --> 26:54.800]  ago they would admit they wanted to take our guns and then they would lose
[26:54.800 --> 26:58.400]  politically and we would rally against them but now they've gotten slicker they
[26:58.400 --> 27:05.720]  just say oh you've won yes oh yes and then the NRA comes and introduces the
[27:05.720 --> 27:11.000]  gun control bills they're compromised have you ever studied how nations fall
[27:11.000 --> 27:16.240]  how people are betrayed they go to who is most trusted and buy them off they
[27:16.240 --> 27:21.320]  don't need to buy off the eye the NRA leadership the NRA was founded by the
[27:21.320 --> 27:28.880]  federal government the year after the Civil War it was founded it is nothing
[27:28.880 --> 27:32.920]  but to prepare quote general military readiness you know these arguments that
[27:32.920 --> 27:38.640]  well it the Supreme Court saying right now it's a militia only the militia can
[27:38.640 --> 27:44.840]  own guns and the militia is the National Guard what was founded in 1906 so how did
[27:44.840 --> 28:00.560]  they in 1776 and 1798 1789 come out with something saying it's an individual
[28:00.560 --> 28:03.640]  right and the people are the militia and then you read the duties of the
[28:03.640 --> 28:08.480]  militia it is to fight the tyrannical government I just read to you know a
[28:08.480 --> 28:16.440]  Webster you read it again to suppose arms in the hands of citizens to be used
[28:16.440 --> 28:21.160]  in individual discretion except in private self-defense or by myriad orders
[28:21.160 --> 28:25.560]  of towns countries or districts of a state it is to demolish every
[28:25.560 --> 28:30.520]  constitution and lay the laws prostate so that liberty can be enjoyed by no man
[28:30.520 --> 28:36.160]  it is a desolation of the government the fundamental law of the militia is that
[28:36.160 --> 28:41.560]  it be created directed and commanded by the laws and ever for the support of the
[28:41.560 --> 28:47.720]  laws that's John Adams a defense of the Constitution let me read you know a
[28:47.720 --> 28:54.160]  Webster before a standing army can rule that's tyranny folks before a standing
[28:54.160 --> 28:59.960]  army can rule the people must be disarmed as they are in almost every kingdom
[28:59.960 --> 29:04.280]  in Europe the supreme power in America cannot enforce unjust laws by the sword
[29:04.280 --> 29:09.600]  because the whole body of the people are armed and constitute a force superior
[29:09.600 --> 29:15.520]  to any band of regular troops that can be on any pretense raised in the United
[29:15.520 --> 29:21.600]  States what about 9-11 Noah you didn't see that a military force at the command
[29:21.600 --> 29:28.040]  of Congress can execute no laws but such as the people perceived to be just and
[29:28.040 --> 29:33.000]  constitutional for they the people possess the power and jealously will
[29:33.000 --> 29:38.320]  instantly inspire the inclination to resist the execution of a law which
[29:38.320 --> 29:42.160]  appears to them unjust and oppressive we're gonna come back with the serious

[32:09.600 --> 32:13.040]  backed by testing that the major oil companies have run yet they don't want

[33:29.320 --> 33:31.320]  All right, welcome back ladies and gentlemen
[33:35.560 --> 33:40.360]  Uh, let's go ahead and get into the news now know what's happened to the second amendment
[33:46.280 --> 33:49.240]  To watch the general public
[33:49.240 --> 33:51.240]  Completely dumbed down
[33:51.240 --> 33:59.240]  Having no idea how their government operates the branches of government any of it and then watching politicians in both parties act like
[33:59.240 --> 34:03.240]  The people's will or what the bill of rights or constitution
[34:03.240 --> 34:07.240]  Says is being honored is very frustrating. Okay
[34:07.240 --> 34:09.240]  The criminals in the supreme court
[34:11.240 --> 34:13.240]  Have ruled that there's no fourth amendment
[34:13.240 --> 34:15.240]  The criminals in the supreme court
[34:15.240 --> 34:19.240]  In the supreme court have ruled that women can kill their babies
[34:20.280 --> 34:24.440]  People say well, they never had a ruling before yet because no one ever thought there needed to be one
[34:25.720 --> 34:31.080]  And even if you're for abortion understand that's the power of the supreme court what they can do overnight
[34:32.680 --> 34:34.280]  Now
[34:34.280 --> 34:38.120]  They are not going to come out and say we can ban all your guns in fact
[34:38.120 --> 34:39.480]  They're doing something much slicker
[34:39.480 --> 34:45.400]  They have never had a supreme court ruling on the second amendment because the first chief justice of the supreme court
[34:46.120 --> 34:53.960]  Uh gave literally hundreds of quotes and statements about the absolute total right of citizens to own firearms
[34:56.920 --> 35:01.480]  And other weapons in resistance to the government including canon
[35:01.480 --> 35:09.240]  Oh, you can't trust the people with that. Oh, but you can trust the government
[35:10.040 --> 35:13.080]  With all the power and control and secrecy and
[35:14.120 --> 35:22.200]  Men and women who lust for power getting into those positions. Oh, let's just have no balance of power with the government
[35:22.280 --> 35:24.280]  Let's just let them have it all
[35:24.280 --> 35:34.360]  So up front it is asinine to even debate with people debating with victim disarmament
[35:35.080 --> 35:37.080]  slave disarmament supporters
[35:38.680 --> 35:42.040]  The useful idiots and the corporates above them who know what it's about slavery
[35:43.080 --> 35:45.080]  And having their property disarmed
[35:45.960 --> 35:49.240]  Just like you declaw and defang a rat before you feed it to the price snake
[35:51.160 --> 35:53.640]  They're going to pull the rat's teeth out. They're going to cut his claws off
[35:53.640 --> 35:57.480]  And throw him in scampering around in the in the in the glass case
[35:59.560 --> 36:05.720]  And most the world has had their fangs pulled and that's why the un can march in rwanda and kill a hundred thousand people
[36:06.040 --> 36:11.560]  Now it's come out decades later as we told you that the un ran the murder
[36:11.960 --> 36:15.800]  Before it was oh, they let it happen and might have helped a little no they ran it
[36:16.920 --> 36:18.920]  and of course they say that
[36:18.920 --> 36:23.880]  In the 2000 july 7th their declaration of gun ban in dc
[36:23.960 --> 36:27.880]  They met in new york and they said unidire the small arms control
[36:28.440 --> 36:33.640]  Division of the un said that civilian ownership of firearms on civilian ownership of firearms
[36:34.120 --> 36:39.400]  Threatens the legitimate power monopoly of the state a power monopoly the state is a dictatorship
[36:40.120 --> 36:45.560]  And they say that our ownership of guns threatens their dictatorship and you're absolutely right it does
[36:45.560 --> 36:51.960]  Now I know most of you already understand this you've you've read the federalist papers
[36:52.280 --> 36:56.680]  You've read the constitution bill of rights. You understand that your neighbor doesn't
[36:57.800 --> 36:59.800]  The guy that's got the harley davison
[36:59.880 --> 37:04.760]  The guy that's got american eagles on every one of his shirts the guy that's got george bush stickers on his car
[37:05.320 --> 37:10.680]  The guy who means well, he's okay to play golf with or go jet skiing with
[37:11.480 --> 37:13.640]  but he thinks everything's fine
[37:13.640 --> 37:21.160]  And if we can't get him angry and moving to defend the second amendment, we're going to lose it and go into civil war
[37:22.200 --> 37:26.280]  Because there are going to be people who are going to fight back in mass as this incrementally happens
[37:26.280 --> 37:30.040]  Even if it's incremental and I don't want that to happen. I don't want to go to that
[37:32.120 --> 37:37.080]  I want to take our government back and then arrest the new world order minions and prosecute them
[37:37.080 --> 37:46.120]  It does nothing to the new world order to you know to talk about big shootouts with cops in the streets and the rest of it and of course the little
[37:46.680 --> 37:49.240]  Pathetic swat teams in every city will be brushed aside. No problem
[37:49.240 --> 37:54.040]  But that's what the globalists want the next phase is federal troops and i4 international armies
[37:54.120 --> 38:00.920]  Which are now publicly in signed agreements to use dutch israeli german british canadian mexican
[38:02.200 --> 38:04.200]  check republic on
[38:04.680 --> 38:06.440]  more than 50 countries
[38:06.440 --> 38:12.200]  To police certain sectors of the u.s. They even come here for 30 years and train in the sectors now though
[38:12.360 --> 38:16.840]  That's not just an army training manuals and documents. It's in the mainstream news
[38:20.680 --> 38:25.400]  Queue up shattered union i want them to hear this this is more and of course you've got jericho and all these other shows
[38:25.480 --> 38:27.480]  Where they're pushing this idea
[38:29.560 --> 38:31.560]  America with a k
[38:32.360 --> 38:34.360]  All of it
[38:34.360 --> 38:38.280]  Pre position pre implanted in the mines out there
[38:40.600 --> 38:42.600]  Now why am i so angry today?
[38:42.920 --> 38:44.920]  How many times
[38:45.400 --> 38:47.400]  Have i said in the last year
[38:48.280 --> 38:50.280]  Since it was announced that in march
[38:50.920 --> 38:54.040]  Of 2008 the supreme court
[38:55.240 --> 38:57.240]  Would hear
[38:57.240 --> 39:05.240]  Oral arguments and the brief on the second amendment dealing with the dc gun ban
[39:07.080 --> 39:11.640]  I want to play this first i'm going to come back and i'm going to give you basically an executive summary of what we're facing
[39:11.800 --> 39:15.560]  Then i want to flesh more of this out, but but this is what they would like to happen
[39:16.280 --> 39:18.680]  They're full of hubris. They're going to end up losing in the end
[39:19.320 --> 39:26.280]  But the police and others better hope the second amendment stays in place and you better hope you're never marched out against us to try to get our guns
[39:26.280 --> 39:29.080]  Because i take no pleasure in what's going to happen to you
[39:29.720 --> 39:35.720]  You will be absolutely destroyed and that's the globalist plan because then they're going to bring in the foreign force
[39:36.440 --> 39:39.240]  How many years did we tell you all this and now you see it in the news?
[39:40.520 --> 39:47.000]  How many years i know it's crazy i know it's hard to believe but truth is stranger than fiction. This is really happening
[39:47.400 --> 39:49.400]  Here it is
[39:49.160 --> 39:51.560]  Following a disputed election and a tie vote
[39:51.560 --> 39:56.200]  The u.s congress installs the most unpopular president in u.s history
[39:56.600 --> 40:01.000]  As david jefferson adams becomes the 44th president of the united states
[40:01.560 --> 40:09.560]  Shortly after the election increased unrest rioting and a growing number of militias have given rise to ever increasing domestic terrorism
[40:11.400 --> 40:18.600]  In response the president invokes the homeland security act and declares martial law on the west coast and other areas of the country
[40:18.600 --> 40:23.960]  Though highly contested a supreme court ruling sidesteps the electoral process
[40:24.680 --> 40:27.400]  disqualifying popular presidential candidates from several states
[40:28.520 --> 40:35.560]  Public outrage explodes when a sham election leads to incumbent david adams accepting a second term in office
[40:37.640 --> 40:40.200]  During the 57th inauguration day ceremonies
[40:40.200 --> 40:48.760]  Washington dc is struck by a low yield nuclear weapon killing david adams and most of the u.s congress
[40:49.560 --> 40:54.120]  The destruction of washington dc effectively breaks the chain of succession
[40:54.440 --> 40:56.440]  Sending the nation into chaos
[40:56.600 --> 41:04.440]  In an emergency vote the european union deploys peacekeepers in the greater dc area to secure international interests
[41:04.440 --> 41:13.240]  With separatist sentiment rising california's governor declares home rule and succeeds from the union
[41:14.120 --> 41:21.240]  texas follows quickly and declares sovereignty taking neighboring states with them and forming the republic of texas
[41:23.080 --> 41:25.080]  now
[41:25.720 --> 41:29.400]  The once united states of america lie in ruin
[41:29.400 --> 41:33.000]  The time for words has passed
[41:33.800 --> 41:39.800]  And the second american civil war now erupts as seven factions wage war across the land
[41:41.240 --> 41:43.960]  They battle one another to reclaim a nation
[41:45.240 --> 41:47.240]  To restore peace
[41:47.720 --> 41:50.840]  To rebuild this shattered union
[41:50.840 --> 42:00.280]  And there are hundreds of video games basically putting out the same line we could play the one we played a week or so ago
[42:00.760 --> 42:01.960]  about the
[42:01.960 --> 42:03.720]  energy wars
[42:03.720 --> 42:07.880]  The oil wars uh where they're gonna shut off our fuel and then you read actual
[42:08.440 --> 42:10.600]  Head of the council on foreign relations says
[42:11.240 --> 42:16.920]  The global warming is fake. It's a way to organize the people against themselves for our police state
[42:16.920 --> 42:20.360]  Terrorism we're going to use that to take their rights
[42:21.720 --> 42:32.040]  Now I could sit here for literally 10 hours. I mean I mean more than that reading founding father quotes about the second amendment being absolute individual right to own
[42:32.840 --> 42:34.840]  muskets
[42:35.240 --> 42:39.640]  The handgun of the age the larger muskets the long rifles the kentucky long rifles
[42:41.560 --> 42:43.560]  Canon
[42:43.560 --> 42:47.880]  And it is for the government that we be an armed camp
[42:48.600 --> 42:53.960]  Jealousy greedily sitting on top of the jewel of liberty. That's a quote by the way
[42:54.600 --> 42:56.600]  guarding it
[42:59.480 --> 43:01.480]  But no
[43:02.200 --> 43:07.320]  Again every line I read was thoughts and information last night. I spent two hours reading
[43:07.960 --> 43:09.960]  The entire briefing
[43:09.960 --> 43:13.960]  I have read the entire briefing
[43:16.120 --> 43:20.920]  You can go to info wars dot com best place to find it and link through
[43:21.720 --> 43:25.400]  to uh the individual right to bear arms one's favor in court
[43:26.360 --> 43:29.720]  argument new york law journal and there they've got a link
[43:30.360 --> 43:34.200]  To the supreme court where you can uh you go to the supreme court itself and try to find it
[43:34.200 --> 43:36.200]  But it's best to go to the main page
[43:36.200 --> 43:38.040]  and get it
[43:38.040 --> 43:40.040]  district of columbia
[43:42.920 --> 43:45.400]  The petitioners are dick anthony heller
[43:47.080 --> 43:51.000]  I'm gonna get him on soon by the way. Now this case has been put forward
[43:53.640 --> 43:58.200]  And this is the above oral argument before the supreme court of the united states
[43:58.680 --> 44:01.560]  1006 a.m appearances and then it begins
[44:01.560 --> 44:06.680]  Walter dillinger esquire washington dc on behalf of the petitioners
[44:09.400 --> 44:12.120]  And then against them is general um
[44:13.080 --> 44:14.200]  attorney
[44:14.200 --> 44:20.840]  paul d clement esquire solicitor general department of justice washington dc on behalf of the united states and amicus
[44:21.880 --> 44:23.880]  supporting the petitioners
[44:23.880 --> 44:25.880]  the white house, okay
[44:26.120 --> 44:28.120]  the bush white house
[44:28.680 --> 44:30.680]  And you read this sucker
[44:30.680 --> 44:35.080]  And they argue for gun bans nationwide
[44:37.080 --> 44:41.800]  So that's one big issue here is we have the white house red
[44:42.600 --> 44:45.640]  Handed and of course their fronts and puppets themselves
[44:46.280 --> 44:49.080]  Bush will be gone soon. Let's forget about him. It's like with clinton
[44:49.880 --> 44:54.200]  Hating the individual is fun and he is a joke and you know the rest of it
[44:54.200 --> 44:57.000]  What do you think using cocaine for 40 years does to you but?
[44:57.000 --> 45:03.320]  And drinking jack daniels, but let's just move on. What do you think having gay porn stars the white house every night does to you?
[45:03.880 --> 45:06.520]  Let's just move on from that. He's a pathetic worm
[45:07.320 --> 45:10.040]  Fully compromised like barack obama hillary and mccain
[45:11.400 --> 45:14.440]  These are sock puppets. These are meat puppets for the new world order
[45:18.280 --> 45:24.920]  They're there because every corporate program every every governmental system is attacking the second amendment
[45:24.920 --> 45:29.080]  Full scale the textbooks the public schools everywhere
[45:29.720 --> 45:31.960]  The government's announcing homeschooling is illegal
[45:32.520 --> 45:38.600]  At state supreme court level in california in illinois. They're announcing. They can unlimited spy on you no fourth amendment
[45:38.680 --> 45:40.680]  I mean, they're making their move right now
[45:41.320 --> 45:44.600]  And this same supreme court seven of the nine appointed by republicans
[45:45.480 --> 45:49.640]  People expect them to hear the hear this and so they're they're playing a trick
[45:49.640 --> 45:56.760]  Everything they've done is for tyranny. Everything they've done is to break down the country every ruling they've had has been
[45:57.320 --> 46:05.080]  180 degrees opposite no debate from the most pro-governmental intent of the founding fathers
[46:05.560 --> 46:08.360]  They're 180 degrees away from alexander hamilton
[46:08.840 --> 46:13.320]  Who was the most statist and wanted a king and wanted to set up their own nobility?
[46:13.320 --> 46:19.320]  And wanted george washington to be the king
[46:22.360 --> 46:28.520]  They're 180 degrees opposite from him. They they're like double negative opposite from thomas jefferson
[46:30.760 --> 46:32.760]  Or george washington
[46:35.080 --> 46:38.280]  Or sam adams or thomas pain
[46:38.280 --> 46:47.960]  There is no debate. I've got alexander hamilton quotes here about how it's to defend against a corrupt government. It's a 100% right
[46:49.240 --> 46:56.120]  100% right to hold and manufacture and have guns congress can make no law dealing with them
[46:56.760 --> 47:02.120]  Just like religion congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof
[47:02.120 --> 47:09.480]  You don't have any purview any jurisdiction any more than a cop from austin texas has jurisdiction in new york
[47:10.600 --> 47:17.400]  Or a new york cop has jurisdiction in tokyo. You don't have jurisdiction. You're the tyrants. You're the criminals
[47:18.040 --> 47:20.040]  And there's lots of criminals who think they're in the right
[47:20.760 --> 47:26.120]  Just because you're tuned in right now and thinking i'm a lion just because you're ignorant doesn't mean you're still not a criminal
[47:26.120 --> 47:32.120]  Ignorance of the law is no excuse
[47:32.440 --> 47:34.840]  And by the way, do you know what the penalty is for treason?
[47:35.480 --> 47:39.080]  Founding fathers are very clear. They said anyone that tries to disarm you
[47:40.200 --> 47:42.920]  Unlawfully should be executed
[47:44.040 --> 47:48.760]  So you need to know that you're being set up and you're on the wrong side of history
[47:48.760 --> 47:57.640]  Now they have national polls of upwards of 98 they just have one last year
[47:58.600 --> 48:01.960]  Of police officers nationwide and 98 are pro gun
[48:02.600 --> 48:06.760]  Cops by and large are pretty good, but the system they're part of is very bad
[48:07.320 --> 48:12.280]  Now over 80 of police chiefs though are pro gun control because they're political
[48:12.920 --> 48:14.760]  a cop knows
[48:14.760 --> 48:16.760]  that in chicago or new york
[48:16.760 --> 48:23.480]  Or la where they have massive gun control or dc highest crime rate in the country per capita since the gun ban
[48:24.840 --> 48:26.680]  They're always the king folks
[48:26.680 --> 48:31.960]  Every once in a while detroit or chicago will pass them or new york, but
[48:32.600 --> 48:34.600]  Overall on average. They're the king
[48:35.720 --> 48:37.720]  in why
[48:37.720 --> 48:41.400]  I've seen newscasts of people live up there. They'll have like five six seven eight dead bolts
[48:41.560 --> 48:43.800]  They'll board up their windows even in middle class areas
[48:43.800 --> 48:46.600]  Because they know folks
[48:48.920 --> 48:50.280]  They know
[48:50.280 --> 48:54.920]  They can come in there and have their way with you and the type of people that would live somewhere like that
[48:55.720 --> 49:00.760]  Who wouldn't move where they could have a second amendment are also the types won't fight back with a butcher knife or baseball bat
[49:02.600 --> 49:04.600]  See it's not just
[49:04.920 --> 49:06.920]  That they don't even have a second amendment there
[49:06.920 --> 49:12.840]  Statistically they don't fight back either because see only someone raised
[49:13.560 --> 49:19.320]  Somewhere where you're trained where your daddy doesn't take you out and teach you that you're going to be a warrior when you grow up
[49:19.480 --> 49:21.080]  And that doesn't mean
[49:21.080 --> 49:26.120]  Running around acting tough that means a man is taught he's going to protect his women protect his family
[49:26.600 --> 49:31.400]  A man is taught to fight back when somebody punches him a man is taught how to use a gun
[49:31.400 --> 49:35.960]  And is taught to use it if somebody attacks you somebody comes in your house
[49:38.360 --> 49:41.960]  You hadn't chopped off what's between my legs i'm not a slave
[49:44.440 --> 49:47.480]  And I understand what the costs are here
[49:53.000 --> 49:59.320]  And to watch americans go into bondage to watch us falling apart and overrun by seas of
[49:59.320 --> 50:01.320]  Desperate third world populations
[50:01.960 --> 50:10.920]  To watch the police dressing like ringwraiths and openly admitting that they're in federal grants putting on intimidating uniforms and the cameras and the
[50:11.160 --> 50:17.720]  Cameras in school bathrooms. I know I say that every day. How do you get over cameras in thousands of school bathrooms in the stalls?
[50:18.280 --> 50:20.280]  See that's 1984 on
[50:20.520 --> 50:23.160]  steroids we're already living deeply in this
[50:23.160 --> 50:29.160]  But we have this vestigial second amendment that they're trying to get rid of
[50:30.520 --> 50:33.240]  And you and you read this the supreme court
[50:35.160 --> 50:38.760]  The supreme court is about to rule they can take your guns
[50:39.720 --> 50:43.080]  But as they announce it they put in the lie
[50:43.720 --> 50:49.640]  Of oh you won you have a right sometimes maybe if we say so
[50:49.640 --> 50:52.600]  The literal end of america
[50:53.160 --> 50:56.520]  Everything's imploding now from the makers of loose change
[50:56.760 --> 51:02.120]  The most downloading film in internet history comes the long-awaited release of loose change final cut
[51:02.520 --> 51:07.400]  An entirely new two-hour film that completely destroys the official fable forever
[51:07.720 --> 51:11.640]  Loose change final cut hopes to be a catalyst for a new independent investigation
[51:11.880 --> 51:18.520]  In which family members receive answers to their questions and the true perpetrators of the surrender's crime are brought to justice
[51:18.520 --> 51:21.960]  Loose change final cut is the ultimate 9 11 expose

[52:04.440 --> 52:09.240]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate and others are absorbed into the skin
[52:09.480 --> 52:15.080]  The kdf dual media shower filter works with both hot and cold water and is designed to reduce chlorine
[52:15.080 --> 52:20.680]  Lead mercury and iron and it inhibits the growth of bacteria mold algae and fungus
[52:20.840 --> 52:26.440]  The kdf dual media shower filter typically lasts 10 000 gallons or one year whichever comes first

[52:54.120 --> 53:00.760]  It's a fact since the creation of the federal reserve in 1913 all banks in these united states create money out of thin air
[53:00.840 --> 53:06.280]  For every single loan they issue with never ending late fees over the limit fees and higher and higher interest rates
[53:06.360 --> 53:11.560]  It has become mathematically impossible to repay all debt making all of us slaves to our creditors
[53:11.560 --> 53:17.720]  The federal debt relief system has created a successful attorney backed program to legally eliminate credit card debt
[53:17.800 --> 53:22.440]  Personal loans lines of credit and other unsecured debts which have been fraudulently created by the banks

[54:24.120 --> 54:31.000]  But I'm not gonna let them catch me no I'm not gonna let them catch the midnight battle
[54:31.000 --> 54:48.920]  And I don't own the clothes I'm wearing And the road goes on forever
[54:48.920 --> 55:01.880]  And I've got one more silver dollar But I'm not gonna let them catch me no I'm not gonna let them catch the midnight battle
[55:01.880 --> 55:03.880]  We're back live ladies and gentlemen
[55:11.880 --> 55:13.880]  We're beginning into the economy with Dr. Paul Craig Roberts
[55:13.880 --> 55:22.840]  Tomorrow we got the head of on and guardians financial section who's openly saying this is all engineered this financial collapse
[55:22.840 --> 55:32.840]  That Larry Pratt coming up in about 40 minutes to break down what's happening with the second amendment
[55:32.840 --> 55:48.840]  So the Supreme Court when you read this 100 plus page oral brief you you get the questions back from the justices the supposed pro gun justices
[55:48.840 --> 56:04.840]  And they say things like well it's not reasonable to have a total gun ban I I can see that we banned some guns and make you lock them up and you know that we track who owns and register
[56:04.840 --> 56:12.840]  But I don't see you know a total ban I think we have the power to restrict
[56:12.840 --> 56:24.840]  Now that's the pro gun that Scalia and others I've got their comments right here we're gonna do a big story on this the next few days just reading it all again takes hours
[56:24.840 --> 56:32.840]  And I'm not whining about that it's just that I do so much study that I need time to even articulate it it's just it's just insane
[56:32.840 --> 56:42.840]  But the basic executive summary is this they have never had a Supreme Court ruling for gun control
[56:42.840 --> 56:54.840]  All they have is the first chief justice and the other chief justices and then a few of the presidents that came along had also been on the Supreme Court previously who were just all wildly second amendment it's an individual right to fight the government
[56:54.840 --> 57:04.840]  It's common street thugs but that's secondary it's mainly for tyrannical government they said it will come you will have to fight and die or you'll be slaves there's quotes like that all day and it just said gut up
[57:04.840 --> 57:16.840]  You see you see movies like 300 that's exaggerated and puffed up but it's really true 300 people held off hundreds of thousands for what a week or something the Alamo
[57:16.840 --> 57:30.840]  187 people against 4000 they were all gonna die colonel Travis said victory or death we're gonna stay here we're gonna die people say modern people say well that's dumb
[57:30.840 --> 57:40.840]  Modern people say you know they should have run they should have given in well most cultures do that and everyone slaves India China

[1:00:22.840 --> 1:00:37.840]  Alright Dr. Roberts coming up with financial news in the next segment former Wall Street Journal editor number two department of Treasury head of policy father of Reaganomics to track what's happening with Bear Stearns and the rest of it very important even if you're not in the stock market it affects you
[1:00:37.840 --> 1:00:43.840]  We've got more guests coming up this week continually on this subject different angles
[1:00:43.840 --> 1:01:08.840]  And in the last 30 minutes this hour Larry Pratt who's been at the Supreme Court is part of the brief okay so you've got the quote pro gun justices in the brief and the supposed pro gun and they say oh well I believe you can restrict the second amendment but you can't completely ban it
[1:01:08.840 --> 1:01:20.840]  Now if you look at jurisprudence you look at case law that's a huge defeat for the second amendment and remember I said that's what they do they come out and say well you've got a narrowly defined right if we say so
[1:01:20.840 --> 1:01:49.840]  That's how that's what the state courts said and then lower federal courts said in New York 30, 40, 50 years ago different cases that have come up they said yeah you've got to write down guns if the sheriff says you can't and you have got to pay about $30,000 in fees and campaign contributions to the sheriff in New York for the county or the police chief and there's been big scandals on this and only mob bosses and billionaires have guns
[1:01:49.840 --> 1:01:58.840]  There are just what a lesson of thousand I was reading just a few months ago gun permits in New York there is no second amendment there
[1:01:58.840 --> 1:02:08.840]  Now that's what the Supreme Court saying and the NRA that supported every piece of gun control legislation they wrote the 68 gun control act
[1:02:08.840 --> 1:02:22.840]  They supported the 2000 quote instant check that federalized everything they supported the Veterans Assignment Act not you the members I've given money to them too I grew up reading the rifleman when I was a kid
[1:02:22.840 --> 1:02:42.840]  It wasn't until 10 years ago I woke up when we were beating gun bills in Texas and the NRA lobbyist came out in the Dallas Morning News and attacked me and said I was extreme that they were neutral on the bill which means they were for it and what was the bill?
[1:02:42.840 --> 1:02:57.840]  Banning YMCA shooting clubs I was there at the legislature and those pieces of trash I mean you want to know they're for gun control you've got to experience it and they support gun control in Chicago and they support it in New York
[1:02:57.840 --> 1:03:15.840]  And guess what when they went and lost the case the NRA lost the case in DC a few years ago they said oh we believe guns should be registered and certain types can be banned and we believe they should be locked up in a safe and we believe in lots of restrictions we just think it's the same argument
[1:03:15.840 --> 1:03:34.840]  No it's an absolute right just like religion is look we've lost most our liberties but the Second Amendment is so in the core of Americana and John Wayne that they have been able to get rid of it completely in most areas of the country
[1:03:34.840 --> 1:03:48.840]  Vermont, Texas, Nevada, Arizona and they're coming on like a hurricane and they've got thousands of lawsuits and cities and counties and states trying to restrict and ban and if they come back which they're saying in this brief they're going to do
[1:03:48.840 --> 1:03:59.840]  and say okay if people want to go get a city permit the city can set the parameters for that then you can get a gun and then they're just not going to issue the permit
[1:03:59.840 --> 1:04:10.840]  and even if they do issue it as they do in some areas so you're already being trained incrementally well I've got my permit and you live in Florida why do you even have a permit the law says you can have a gun
[1:04:10.840 --> 1:04:23.840]  yeah but see that means the cops will harass you a permit is a license a license is something is a government certificate to do something that would otherwise be illegal
[1:04:23.840 --> 1:04:30.840]  so we'll cover this more after we cover some of the financial news today
[1:04:30.840 --> 1:04:41.840]  and later I want to lead to you the Washington Post and the New York law journal because the biggest issue here isn't what the Supreme Court's doing we knew they do that
[1:04:41.840 --> 1:04:50.840]  it's how they're going how they're conning the public into thinking this is a pro second amendment ruling we've got to mobilize the troops folks or we lose the second amendment

[1:08:04.840 --> 1:08:09.840]  a devastating indictment of our current system of justice
[1:08:09.840 --> 1:08:12.840]  Milton Friedman who just died as you know
[1:08:12.840 --> 1:08:18.840]  the tyranny of good intentions by the way arthur c clark the inventor of the telecommunications satellite
[1:08:18.840 --> 1:08:23.840]  and an amazing science fiction writer died at 90 years of age in Sri Lanka
[1:08:23.840 --> 1:08:26.840]  thought I'd just throw that out as interesting when I was mentioning Milton Friedman
[1:08:26.840 --> 1:08:32.840]  the tyranny of good intentions how prosecutors and law enforcement are trampling the constitution in the name of justice
[1:08:32.840 --> 1:08:38.840]  paul craig roberts and of course paul craig roberts was the assistant secretary of the treasury and the reg
[1:08:38.840 --> 1:08:43.840]  administration university professor and associate editor of the wall street journal he is nationally syndicated columnist
[1:08:43.840 --> 1:08:50.840]  for creators syndicate and he wrote the book with laurence m stratton the phd candidate

[1:08:56.840 --> 1:09:00.840]  he is currently on the adjunct ethics faculty at uh...
[1:09:00.840 --> 1:09:06.840]  villanova university okay and the book is the tyranny of good intentions in bookstores everywhere now
[1:09:06.840 --> 1:09:11.840]  it's a very nice little book I read the first edition when it came out a few years ago it's back out now
[1:09:11.840 --> 1:09:16.840]  even better and uh... dr roberts we only got you about twenty five minutes so let's
[1:09:16.840 --> 1:09:23.840]  move quick we saw them hammer down gold they admit that they have the IMF dump a bunch of gold they also
[1:09:23.840 --> 1:09:30.840]  sell their long position they they sell gold futures at a reduced price to artificially drive it down but it looks
[1:09:30.840 --> 1:09:34.840]  like that's not working anymore they've been doing that every week and only
[1:09:34.840 --> 1:09:41.840]  three pounds later uh... i've had the head of the new york business school on i've had a bunch of other top
[1:09:41.840 --> 1:09:47.840]  economist on the last two weeks like yourself and everybody says this continues
[1:09:47.840 --> 1:09:52.840]  hyperinflationary depression within two years
[1:09:52.840 --> 1:09:58.840]  give us your basic take on the we have met on about two weeks on all the insanity bear sterns
[1:09:58.840 --> 1:10:03.840]  going for two dollars a share of the uh...
[1:10:03.840 --> 1:10:06.840]  you know the government financing jp morgan
[1:10:06.840 --> 1:10:09.840]  uh... and the rest of them to come in and
[1:10:09.840 --> 1:10:14.840]  uh... prop up these other groups just it it seems to me like it's deteriorating
[1:10:14.840 --> 1:10:17.840]  at an accelerated rate or am i wrong
[1:10:17.840 --> 1:10:20.840]  uh... well uh... alex you probably aren't wrong
[1:10:20.840 --> 1:10:23.840]  uh... the point is nobody really knows
[1:10:23.840 --> 1:10:29.840]  because we still don't know the extent of the problem and and we still know nobody can bet
[1:10:29.840 --> 1:10:32.840]  on the united states government doing anything intelligent
[1:10:32.840 --> 1:10:37.840]  look at the past seven years record that you can't find one intelligent decision
[1:10:37.840 --> 1:10:41.840]  you see alex is bad as the
[1:10:41.840 --> 1:10:46.840]  subprime derivative market is and all the damages
[1:10:46.840 --> 1:10:51.840]  done and and may yet do to the financial system
[1:10:51.840 --> 1:10:54.840]  i regard that almost as a
[1:10:54.840 --> 1:10:57.840]  as a side show
[1:10:57.840 --> 1:10:59.840]  and the real
[1:10:59.840 --> 1:11:01.840]  that's all due to
[1:11:01.840 --> 1:11:04.840]  too much deregulation
[1:11:04.840 --> 1:11:09.840]  they abolished the glass teagle act in nineteen ninety nine the clinton administration
[1:11:09.840 --> 1:11:10.840]  and this
[1:11:10.840 --> 1:11:15.840]  broke the wall between commercial banks and investment banks and
[1:11:15.840 --> 1:11:17.840]  and that's where all of this
[1:11:17.840 --> 1:11:21.840]  the stupid new instruments agreed the carelessness
[1:11:21.840 --> 1:11:23.840]  has come from
[1:11:23.840 --> 1:11:26.840]  but it's a side show in my opinion the real show
[1:11:26.840 --> 1:11:31.840]  is the collapse of the united states dollar is the world reserve currency
[1:11:31.840 --> 1:11:32.840]  and that
[1:11:32.840 --> 1:11:35.840]  perhaps is ongoing and it's really
[1:11:35.840 --> 1:11:36.840]  probably uh...
[1:11:36.840 --> 1:11:39.840]  it's worsened probably by all the panic
[1:11:39.840 --> 1:11:41.840]  from the subprime
[1:11:41.840 --> 1:11:42.840]  but it
[1:11:42.840 --> 1:11:43.840]  owes
[1:11:43.840 --> 1:11:46.840]  it's a real cause to the
[1:11:46.840 --> 1:11:47.840]  trade deficits
[1:11:47.840 --> 1:11:48.840]  which
[1:11:48.840 --> 1:11:49.840]  have reached
[1:11:49.840 --> 1:11:53.840]  such levels that they no longer appear to be closeable
[1:11:53.840 --> 1:11:56.840]  we can't close
[1:11:56.840 --> 1:11:57.840]  the trade deficit
[1:11:57.840 --> 1:11:59.840]  when
[1:11:59.840 --> 1:12:05.840]  the total u.s. imports exceed total u.s. manufacturing output
[1:12:05.840 --> 1:12:08.840]  there's no way even if everything we manufactured
[1:12:08.840 --> 1:12:12.840]  we sold the ball it still wouldn't pay for our imports
[1:12:12.840 --> 1:12:17.840]  dr roberts let's let's say the white house it are a bunch of idiots and they're not doing this
[1:12:17.840 --> 1:12:20.840]  on purpose and they haven't pulled their money out of their funds
[1:12:20.840 --> 1:12:23.840]  before they implode them like nron they're not running a scam
[1:12:23.840 --> 1:12:25.840]  let's just say they're crazy
[1:12:25.840 --> 1:12:28.840]  they've got to have at least a plan in their mind
[1:12:28.840 --> 1:12:30.840]  and they they know
[1:12:30.840 --> 1:12:34.840]  that when they go around the world badmouthing the dollar that drives it down
[1:12:34.840 --> 1:12:36.840]  uh... while domestically
[1:12:36.840 --> 1:12:40.840]  uh... they are saying everything's wonderful
[1:12:40.840 --> 1:12:42.840]  the dollar is a political statement
[1:12:42.840 --> 1:12:45.840]  they've got to know cutting interest rates twice in one week
[1:12:45.840 --> 1:12:47.840]  by a full point total
[1:12:47.840 --> 1:12:50.840]  uh... is going to drive the dollar down further are they just
[1:12:50.840 --> 1:12:53.840]  kind of playing Russian roulette or chicken with the foreigners
[1:12:53.840 --> 1:12:56.840]  saying we'll go ahead you're holding so many dollars there's nothing you can do
[1:12:56.840 --> 1:12:59.840]  I mean what do you think they think they're doing
[1:12:59.840 --> 1:13:00.840]  well you know
[1:13:00.840 --> 1:13:01.840]  Alex
[1:13:01.840 --> 1:13:03.840]  a few weeks back we
[1:13:03.840 --> 1:13:04.840]  you and I talked
[1:13:04.840 --> 1:13:06.840]  about the dilemma that
[1:13:06.840 --> 1:13:08.840]  they face two
[1:13:08.840 --> 1:13:09.840]  simultaneous
[1:13:09.840 --> 1:13:10.840]  problems
[1:13:10.840 --> 1:13:12.840]  that are dangerous
[1:13:12.840 --> 1:13:14.840]  and the solution
[1:13:14.840 --> 1:13:16.840]  for the problems of contradictory
[1:13:16.840 --> 1:13:19.840]  to save the impaired
[1:13:19.840 --> 1:13:22.840]  and imploding financial system
[1:13:22.840 --> 1:13:25.840]  they need to pump out all the liquidity that they possibly can
[1:13:25.840 --> 1:13:27.840]  thus the low interest rates
[1:13:27.840 --> 1:13:30.840]  but as you just noted
[1:13:30.840 --> 1:13:32.840]  those low interest rates
[1:13:32.840 --> 1:13:34.840]  undermine
[1:13:34.840 --> 1:13:35.840]  the dollar
[1:13:35.840 --> 1:13:36.840]  and
[1:13:36.840 --> 1:13:40.840]  the government to borrow abroad to finance its deficit
[1:13:40.840 --> 1:13:41.840]  so
[1:13:41.840 --> 1:13:44.840]  that's contradictory right now
[1:13:44.840 --> 1:13:47.840]  they have decided
[1:13:47.840 --> 1:13:51.840]  that the pressure is mainly on the financial system and that's urgent
[1:13:51.840 --> 1:13:55.840]  and so they're pumping out the liquidity now
[1:13:55.840 --> 1:13:57.840]  when it changes
[1:13:57.840 --> 1:14:00.840]  and the dollar starts going down
[1:14:00.840 --> 1:14:03.840]  it's such a precipitous rate that
[1:14:03.840 --> 1:14:06.840]  becomes even more alarming
[1:14:06.840 --> 1:14:09.840]  and they see that hey we might not be able
[1:14:09.840 --> 1:14:12.840]  to clear the next treasury auction
[1:14:12.840 --> 1:14:14.840]  what if the bonds aren't taken
[1:14:14.840 --> 1:14:16.840]  that we put up
[1:14:16.840 --> 1:14:19.840]  we gotta boost the interest rates
[1:14:19.840 --> 1:14:23.840]  to give people incentive to continue to lend to us
[1:14:23.840 --> 1:14:24.840]  that's ahead
[1:14:24.840 --> 1:14:26.840]  that may yet
[1:14:26.840 --> 1:14:27.840]  come
[1:14:27.840 --> 1:14:28.840]  so
[1:14:28.840 --> 1:14:31.840]  well we already see we already see foreigners
[1:14:31.840 --> 1:14:34.840]  slowing how much money they'll put into bailouts
[1:14:34.840 --> 1:14:37.840]  we see all these Latin American countries
[1:14:37.840 --> 1:14:39.840]  saying they're not going to be in dollars anymore
[1:14:39.840 --> 1:14:41.840]  we see European nations moving away from the dollar
[1:14:41.840 --> 1:14:43.840]  the Arabs moving away
[1:14:43.840 --> 1:14:45.840]  we see that creed towards the door
[1:14:45.840 --> 1:14:47.840]  everybody getting up and leaving
[1:14:47.840 --> 1:14:49.840]  starting to happen
[1:14:49.840 --> 1:14:51.840]  right but you know
[1:14:51.840 --> 1:14:53.840]  when it hits Washington
[1:14:53.840 --> 1:14:55.840]  will be the day
[1:14:55.840 --> 1:14:58.840]  they can't sell the next round of treasury bonds
[1:14:58.840 --> 1:15:00.840]  to finance the government's current budget
[1:15:00.840 --> 1:15:03.840]  or to finance the war
[1:15:03.840 --> 1:15:05.840]  you see the day
[1:15:05.840 --> 1:15:09.840]  the day they bring a new round of treasury bonds
[1:15:09.840 --> 1:15:10.840]  to auction
[1:15:10.840 --> 1:15:11.840]  that's how they sell them
[1:15:11.840 --> 1:15:13.840]  they put them up for bid
[1:15:13.840 --> 1:15:17.840]  and the bidders don't take all the bonds
[1:15:17.840 --> 1:15:20.840]  then that's when they know
[1:15:20.840 --> 1:15:23.840]  they gotta jump the interest rates up
[1:15:23.840 --> 1:15:25.840]  and so if they gotta jump the interest rates up
[1:15:25.840 --> 1:15:28.840]  before they get enough liquidity in to float
[1:15:28.840 --> 1:15:31.840]  the insolvent banking system
[1:15:31.840 --> 1:15:34.840]  they're really in trouble
[1:15:34.840 --> 1:15:37.840]  but sir, I mean just looking at it as a layman
[1:15:37.840 --> 1:15:40.840]  they're pumping hundreds of billions a month
[1:15:40.840 --> 1:15:42.840]  and then of course selling that debt globally with the bonds
[1:15:42.840 --> 1:15:45.840]  for listeners that don't understand that
[1:15:45.840 --> 1:15:48.840]  then it looks like it's doing nothing
[1:15:48.840 --> 1:15:50.840]  like the body's gone into shock
[1:15:50.840 --> 1:15:52.840]  the blood's just pouring out
[1:15:52.840 --> 1:15:53.840]  there's too many wounds
[1:15:53.840 --> 1:15:55.840]  it appears that them dumping all this money
[1:15:55.840 --> 1:15:59.840]  only drives confidence down even more
[1:15:59.840 --> 1:16:02.840]  well, liquidity usually historically
[1:16:02.840 --> 1:16:04.840]  drives stock market up
[1:16:04.840 --> 1:16:08.840]  and we saw that yesterday
[1:16:08.840 --> 1:16:11.840]  but it's watered down liquidity
[1:16:11.840 --> 1:16:13.840]  they're having trouble
[1:16:13.840 --> 1:16:16.840]  because the banking system is impaired
[1:16:16.840 --> 1:16:19.840]  and so they're having trouble getting the liquidity
[1:16:19.840 --> 1:16:21.840]  that they're pumping out
[1:16:21.840 --> 1:16:22.840]  through the banking system
[1:16:22.840 --> 1:16:25.840]  in to consumer hands to drive the economy
[1:16:25.840 --> 1:16:27.840]  they'll probably fail in that
[1:16:27.840 --> 1:16:29.840]  but they may succeed
[1:16:29.840 --> 1:16:31.840]  and I don't know that they will
[1:16:31.840 --> 1:16:34.840]  but they may succeed in getting liquidity
[1:16:34.840 --> 1:16:36.840]  into the banks themselves
[1:16:36.840 --> 1:16:39.840]  through these new mechanisms they have
[1:16:39.840 --> 1:16:43.840]  of lending money based on these bad securities
[1:16:43.840 --> 1:16:47.840]  and technically they can't
[1:16:47.840 --> 1:16:49.840]  buy these securities outright
[1:16:49.840 --> 1:16:53.840]  but in fact they can by continually to roll over the loans
[1:16:53.840 --> 1:16:58.840]  so they can sort of take the securities out of the
[1:16:58.840 --> 1:17:00.840]  trouble securities out of the banking system
[1:17:00.840 --> 1:17:03.840]  by lending on them and just keep rolling over those loans
[1:17:03.840 --> 1:17:04.840]  I know you're an economist
[1:17:04.840 --> 1:17:05.840]  you're not a forecaster
[1:17:05.840 --> 1:17:08.840]  but you have made quite a few predictions that have come true
[1:17:08.840 --> 1:17:11.840]  not a prediction but in your gut
[1:17:11.840 --> 1:17:12.840]  where do you see this going?
[1:17:12.840 --> 1:17:14.840]  do you think they'll ever be able to pull it out
[1:17:14.840 --> 1:17:16.840]  and when we just have a bad recession
[1:17:16.840 --> 1:17:18.840]  or do you see this inevitably leading
[1:17:18.840 --> 1:17:23.840]  into just some type of just huge explosion?
[1:17:23.840 --> 1:17:26.840]  I think what you're going to see is
[1:17:26.840 --> 1:17:31.840]  the dollar loses its reserve currency roll
[1:17:31.840 --> 1:17:33.840]  and that means that the United States
[1:17:33.840 --> 1:17:37.840]  cannot any longer pay its bills in its own currency
[1:17:37.840 --> 1:17:41.840]  and so it'll have trouble paying for its import
[1:17:41.840 --> 1:17:44.840]  imports, oil and otherwise
[1:17:44.840 --> 1:17:48.840]  manufacturing goods, food, whatever it's trying to import
[1:17:48.840 --> 1:17:52.840]  So not dying with a bang, going out with a whimper?
[1:17:52.840 --> 1:17:55.840]  I think you'll see what you're seeing
[1:17:55.840 --> 1:17:58.840]  is the collapse of American power
[1:17:58.840 --> 1:18:00.840]  look, here's the fact
[1:18:00.840 --> 1:18:05.840]  the United States is not a financially independent country
[1:18:05.840 --> 1:18:09.840]  it is dependent on foreigners
[1:18:09.840 --> 1:18:12.840]  to finance the day-to-day operations of the government
[1:18:12.840 --> 1:18:15.840]  including the wars
[1:18:15.840 --> 1:18:18.840]  it's dependent on foreigners to finance
[1:18:18.840 --> 1:18:21.840]  its trade deficit, its over consumption
[1:18:21.840 --> 1:18:24.840]  so it's not a financially independent country
[1:18:24.840 --> 1:18:27.840]  and the notion that a country that is not
[1:18:27.840 --> 1:18:31.840]  financially independent can be the reserve currency
[1:18:31.840 --> 1:18:33.840]  is a contradiction in terms
[1:18:33.840 --> 1:18:37.840]  and so if the reserve currency roll
[1:18:37.840 --> 1:18:40.840]  will be lost when, I don't know
[1:18:40.840 --> 1:18:42.840]  it's in the process of being lost
[1:18:42.840 --> 1:18:46.840]  and that means we can no longer
[1:18:46.840 --> 1:18:49.840]  rely on foreigners to pay our bills
[1:18:49.840 --> 1:18:52.840]  so how are they going to close the trade and budget deficit
[1:18:52.840 --> 1:18:57.840]  that will be a major kind of crisis
[1:18:57.840 --> 1:18:59.840]  well I've seen the numbers
[1:18:59.840 --> 1:19:02.840]  it will depress American living standards further
[1:19:02.840 --> 1:19:06.840]  so we're going into basically third world serfdom
[1:19:06.840 --> 1:19:10.840]  I said about three years ago at a big conference
[1:19:10.840 --> 1:19:12.840]  televised that in 20 years the United States
[1:19:12.840 --> 1:19:14.840]  would be a third world country
[1:19:14.840 --> 1:19:16.840]  I'm sticking to that prediction
[1:19:16.840 --> 1:19:18.840]  well I think in many areas it already is
[1:19:18.840 --> 1:19:20.840]  final segment with Dr. Roberts will talk about
[1:19:20.840 --> 1:19:23.840]  several pieces you've written in the last week
[1:19:23.840 --> 1:19:25.840]  watching the dollar die
[1:19:25.840 --> 1:19:28.840]  and the newest one, the end of American power
[1:19:28.840 --> 1:19:30.840]  but my question when we first come back
[1:19:30.840 --> 1:19:32.840]  moving quick with Dr. Roberts who's a new book
[1:19:32.840 --> 1:19:34.840]  is out the tyranny of good intentions
[1:19:34.840 --> 1:19:36.840]  there are numbers everywhere
[1:19:36.840 --> 1:19:38.840]  is that to me it's real simple
[1:19:38.840 --> 1:19:42.840]  Wall Street, the big foreign brokerage houses, the banks
[1:19:42.840 --> 1:19:44.840]  are sacrificing this country
[1:19:44.840 --> 1:19:46.840]  to make sure they survive
[1:19:46.840 --> 1:19:48.840]  and the dollar
[1:19:50.840 --> 1:19:53.840]  it is a big idea
[1:19:53.840 --> 1:19:55.840]  a new world order
[1:19:55.840 --> 1:19:57.840]  in the near future
[1:19:57.840 --> 1:20:00.840]  earth is dominated by a powerful world government
[1:20:00.840 --> 1:20:02.840]  it's known as the builder bird
[1:20:02.840 --> 1:20:05.840]  could their objective be world domination?
[1:20:05.840 --> 1:20:08.840]  for thousands of years their dark order grew
[1:20:08.840 --> 1:20:11.840]  now as they hail the birth of the new world order
[1:20:11.840 --> 1:20:15.840]  their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity
[1:20:15.840 --> 1:20:18.840]  is at hand
[1:20:18.840 --> 1:20:20.840]  for the first time in history
[1:20:20.840 --> 1:20:22.840]  the elite's plan for world government
[1:20:22.840 --> 1:20:24.840]  is blown wide open
[1:20:24.840 --> 1:20:26.840]  you will learn the secret that drives
[1:20:26.840 --> 1:20:28.840]  the entire new world order agenda
[1:20:28.840 --> 1:20:30.840]  builder bird is making great progress
[1:20:30.840 --> 1:20:32.840]  in the world
[1:20:32.840 --> 1:20:34.840]  most people have no idea they're not after money
[1:20:34.840 --> 1:20:36.840]  they have all the money they need
[1:20:36.840 --> 1:20:38.840]  they're after power

[1:22:53.840 --> 1:22:54.840]  he is still in the race
[1:22:54.840 --> 1:22:58.840]  most Americans do not understand how the election process works
[1:22:58.840 --> 1:22:59.840]  the media is lying
[1:22:59.840 --> 1:23:02.840]  John McCain does not have the Republican nomination
[1:23:02.840 --> 1:23:05.840]  the popular vote is just a straw poll believe it or not
[1:23:05.840 --> 1:23:08.840]  the delegates have the power over the elections
[1:23:08.840 --> 1:23:09.840]  not the voters
[1:23:09.840 --> 1:23:12.840]  after the mainstream media wrote a hit piece on how Ron Paul quit
[1:23:12.840 --> 1:23:14.840]  many supporters quit as well
[1:23:14.840 --> 1:23:17.840]  Ron Paul has stated he will continue his run for presidency

[1:23:20.840 --> 1:23:21.840]  Ron Paul has a plan
[1:23:21.840 --> 1:23:23.840]  the delegates have not yet been voted on
[1:23:23.840 --> 1:23:25.840]  and they are voted first in county
[1:23:25.840 --> 1:23:28.840]  then state all the way to the national convention

[1:24:06.840 --> 1:24:10.840]  we've got Dr. Paul Craig Roberts our guest new book out
[1:24:10.840 --> 1:24:12.840]  the tyranny of good intentions
[1:24:14.840 --> 1:24:17.840]  okay I mean it really seems like an elementary equation
[1:24:17.840 --> 1:24:20.840]  you've got these greedy corrupt brokerage houses and banks
[1:24:20.840 --> 1:24:22.840]  that just do whatever they want
[1:24:22.840 --> 1:24:25.840]  they write their own you know
[1:24:25.840 --> 1:24:29.840]  non-backed securities bundles of derivatives you name it
[1:24:29.840 --> 1:24:33.840]  just all sorts of housing loans together they sell them
[1:24:33.840 --> 1:24:37.840]  they get billions of dollars of bonuses per company every year
[1:24:37.840 --> 1:24:41.840]  and they literally are destroying the dollar the country
[1:24:41.840 --> 1:24:44.840]  our future this institution everything
[1:24:44.840 --> 1:24:49.840]  just so they can continue pumping up the bubble
[1:24:49.840 --> 1:24:53.840]  and I mean it really I guess in my mind
[1:24:53.840 --> 1:24:56.840]  comes down to something pretty simple do you agree with that statement
[1:24:56.840 --> 1:24:59.840]  well Alex they're also destroying themselves
[1:24:59.840 --> 1:25:03.840]  Bear Stearns is gone it may not be the only one
[1:25:03.840 --> 1:25:07.840]  the Carlisle Group
[1:25:07.840 --> 1:25:11.840]  which is a company in which American President
[1:25:11.840 --> 1:25:15.840]  the Bushes Jim Baker foreign potentiate
[1:25:15.840 --> 1:25:17.840]  Queen of England
[1:25:17.840 --> 1:25:22.840]  this thing has collapsed and it's not bailed out it's gone
[1:25:22.840 --> 1:25:26.840]  so they're destroying themselves you're certainly right
[1:25:26.840 --> 1:25:30.840]  that greed has caused them to be incompetent
[1:25:30.840 --> 1:25:34.840]  and what it really is it's like a bunch of
[1:25:34.840 --> 1:25:38.840]  sports freaks who want their team to do best
[1:25:38.840 --> 1:25:42.840]  so each investment bank wanted to pay
[1:25:42.840 --> 1:25:45.840]  higher bonuses than its competitor
[1:25:45.840 --> 1:25:50.840]  and it was all some sort of a crazy greed driven incompetence
[1:25:50.840 --> 1:25:54.840]  and it's come home and I suspect
[1:25:54.840 --> 1:25:57.840]  unless we get another Republican in there
[1:25:57.840 --> 1:26:00.840]  that we will have a return of regulation
[1:26:00.840 --> 1:26:03.840]  to prevent this sort of insanity
[1:26:03.840 --> 1:26:07.840]  it should never they should never have to peel Glass-Steagall
[1:26:07.840 --> 1:26:11.840]  so they are suffering themselves not only that
[1:26:11.840 --> 1:26:15.840]  but partners have had to take large stakes
[1:26:15.840 --> 1:26:19.840]  and many of the banks and both commercial investment banks
[1:26:19.840 --> 1:26:23.840]  and so they are kind of losing control
[1:26:23.840 --> 1:26:26.840]  and they are becoming now dependent
[1:26:26.840 --> 1:26:29.840]  on the attitude of the parties or whoever else
[1:26:29.840 --> 1:26:32.840]  is now sitting on their board
[1:26:32.840 --> 1:26:36.840]  and so it's costing them a loss of control
[1:26:36.840 --> 1:26:39.840]  but isn't that what the globalist always said they wanted
[1:26:39.840 --> 1:26:42.840]  was to get control of the US by
[1:26:42.840 --> 1:26:45.840]  shipping our manufacturing overseas by
[1:26:45.840 --> 1:26:48.840]  driving down the dollar so they could buy up our infrastructure
[1:26:48.840 --> 1:26:51.840]  a month ago the CFR wrote that big report saying
[1:26:51.840 --> 1:26:54.840]  yeah let's get rid of the dollar and bring in the Amaro
[1:26:54.840 --> 1:26:56.840]  I'm sure you've seen that
[1:26:56.840 --> 1:26:59.840]  or is that just pipe dreams
[1:26:59.840 --> 1:27:02.840]  is that like the psychological excuse for what they're doing
[1:27:02.840 --> 1:27:05.840]  oh it's part of a plan but really it's just greediness
[1:27:05.840 --> 1:27:09.840]  I think it's some kind of pipe dreams
[1:27:09.840 --> 1:27:12.840]  we've talked about this before I think most of our troubles
[1:27:12.840 --> 1:27:15.840]  are the unintended consequences of ignorance
[1:27:15.840 --> 1:27:19.840]  and incompetence and unregulated greed
[1:27:19.840 --> 1:27:23.840]  I don't see how anybody gains from destroying
[1:27:23.840 --> 1:27:27.840]  the capability of the American economy
[1:27:27.840 --> 1:27:30.840]  certainly not any kind of one world
[1:27:30.840 --> 1:27:32.840]  they would want to use this as a platform
[1:27:32.840 --> 1:27:35.840]  and it's inconsistent with the neocon
[1:27:35.840 --> 1:27:39.840]  ideology which is American hegemy, American supremacy
[1:27:39.840 --> 1:27:43.840]  well I've talked to a lot of experts who say that
[1:27:43.840 --> 1:27:45.840]  they are trying to set up this world government
[1:27:45.840 --> 1:27:47.840]  and that's in their own quotes the head of the CFR
[1:27:47.840 --> 1:27:49.840]  calls for it Richard Haas
[1:27:49.840 --> 1:27:52.840]  but that these are the sons now of the old guys
[1:27:52.840 --> 1:27:54.840]  that really were smart and hard working
[1:27:54.840 --> 1:27:57.840]  but Alex
[1:27:57.840 --> 1:28:01.840]  the Bush administration's policy makers keep insisting
[1:28:01.840 --> 1:28:04.840]  that the United States is supreme
[1:28:04.840 --> 1:28:08.840]  that we don't have to pay attention to any international law
[1:28:08.840 --> 1:28:11.840]  to the UN to anything
[1:28:11.840 --> 1:28:15.840]  and that we are above everything so that's inconsistent
[1:28:15.840 --> 1:28:18.840]  I think in fact we are being taken over
[1:28:18.840 --> 1:28:21.840]  through failure
[1:28:21.840 --> 1:28:25.840]  as I say the United States is not a financially independent country
[1:28:25.840 --> 1:28:27.840]  well I was agreeing with you I'm saying
[1:28:27.840 --> 1:28:30.840]  we've got the spoiled brat kids of the old oligarchy
[1:28:30.840 --> 1:28:32.840]  that ran this country and they're just
[1:28:32.840 --> 1:28:36.840]  they're too busy with Jeff Gannon at the White House
[1:28:36.840 --> 1:28:39.840]  I don't know what to
[1:28:39.840 --> 1:28:41.840]  I think they're in delusion
[1:28:41.840 --> 1:28:44.840]  I think the neoconservatives who have control
[1:28:44.840 --> 1:28:47.840]  the Bush administration for seven years
[1:28:47.840 --> 1:28:49.840]  are deluded people
[1:28:49.840 --> 1:28:53.840]  and they think that there's power here that's not here
[1:28:53.840 --> 1:28:57.840]  and so they are not aware of the impending collapse
[1:28:57.840 --> 1:29:00.840]  of American power
[1:29:00.840 --> 1:29:03.840]  it's coming at us financially economically
[1:29:03.840 --> 1:29:06.840]  look how can you be a superpower
[1:29:06.840 --> 1:29:09.840]  if your imports exceed your industrial production
[1:29:09.840 --> 1:29:11.840]  oh I understand that
[1:29:11.840 --> 1:29:14.840]  how can you be a superpower
[1:29:14.840 --> 1:29:17.840]  if you're dependent on China and Japan to finance your operations
[1:29:17.840 --> 1:29:18.840]  and your wars
[1:29:18.840 --> 1:29:20.840]  no sir I understand and I appreciate your time
[1:29:20.840 --> 1:29:23.840]  you're joining us for a full hour to talk about your book
[1:29:23.840 --> 1:29:26.840]  and a host of issues and get into some solutions
[1:29:26.840 --> 1:29:29.840]  of what you would do to try to turn this around next week
[1:29:29.840 --> 1:29:31.840]  Dr. Roberts, thanks for spending time with us
[1:29:31.840 --> 1:29:33.840]  thank you Alex always a joy to talk to you

[1:30:50.840 --> 1:30:56.840]  the ideology powering the Democrats and Republicans is not liberalism or conservatism
[1:30:56.840 --> 1:30:57.840]  but globalism
[1:30:57.840 --> 1:31:00.840]  globalists are concerned with what's good for the American empire
[1:31:00.840 --> 1:31:02.840]  instead of what's fair for the American people
[1:31:02.840 --> 1:31:06.840]  the only antidote to the poison of globalism is nationalism

[1:31:56.840 --> 1:31:58.840]  the answer is not the creation of more debt

[1:33:23.840 --> 1:33:26.840]  I'll never give up my second amendment
[1:33:29.840 --> 1:33:33.840]  I'm never gonna be your slave you control freak scum
[1:33:33.840 --> 1:33:39.840]  we're coming for ya crank it up if you'll think I sit around
[1:33:39.840 --> 1:33:46.840]  you're thinking like a fool cause all it takes is you and I
[1:33:51.840 --> 1:33:55.840]  we have to stop giving up our second amendment
[1:33:55.840 --> 1:34:02.840]  okay I predicted that the supreme court would claim we were gonna have a victory
[1:34:02.840 --> 1:34:05.840]  and strike down the DC gunband
[1:34:05.840 --> 1:34:08.840]  but they would say oh but we're allowed to have some restrictions
[1:34:08.840 --> 1:34:11.840]  now that's nowhere in law, nowhere in the bill of rights
[1:34:11.840 --> 1:34:13.840]  we read a bunch of founding father quotes
[1:34:13.840 --> 1:34:15.840]  there's literally thousands of them
[1:34:15.840 --> 1:34:17.840]  but we read dozens in the first hour
[1:34:17.840 --> 1:34:19.840]  about how it's to defend against a corrupt government
[1:34:19.840 --> 1:34:21.840]  it's to protect the people against crime
[1:34:21.840 --> 1:34:23.840]  that if the government tries to take your guns
[1:34:23.840 --> 1:34:27.840]  you need to overthrow them that that's the surest sign of tyranny
[1:34:27.840 --> 1:34:30.840]  and so I see this as a great defeat
[1:34:30.840 --> 1:34:37.840]  because I read all 90 plus pages of the oral arguments last night almost crying
[1:34:37.840 --> 1:34:43.840]  because the supposed pro-gun justices would say
[1:34:43.840 --> 1:34:47.840]  oh well I think we should have reasonable restrictions
[1:34:47.840 --> 1:34:52.840]  but you can't you know you can't just outright ban it
[1:34:52.840 --> 1:34:55.840]  and besides wouldn't that be a federal matter
[1:34:55.840 --> 1:34:57.840]  I mean I've got these quotes here
[1:34:57.840 --> 1:35:01.840]  now donors of America help with the brief they're not running the brief
[1:35:01.840 --> 1:35:05.840]  it freaked me out and I'm writing articles about this right now with Paul Watson
[1:35:05.840 --> 1:35:08.840]  to see even the people arguing on behalf of the Second Amendment saying
[1:35:08.840 --> 1:35:11.840]  oh well we agree there can be some restrictions
[1:35:11.840 --> 1:35:17.840]  no, no, no, no they are going to use this
[1:35:17.840 --> 1:35:21.840]  and they're also going to use it to go out and say
[1:35:21.840 --> 1:35:23.840]  oh we've won the Second Amendment's safe
[1:35:23.840 --> 1:35:25.840]  you type gun control into Google folks
[1:35:25.840 --> 1:35:28.840]  or gun owners of America where they're fighting in our NRA
[1:35:28.840 --> 1:35:30.840]  hundreds of articles come up every day
[1:35:30.840 --> 1:35:32.840]  we're being hit from every angle
[1:35:32.840 --> 1:35:35.840]  now I'm going to shut up and go to Larry Pratt a very busy man
[1:35:35.840 --> 1:35:37.840]  executive directors of gun owners of America
[1:35:37.840 --> 1:35:40.840]  they're the only big pro-second amendment group in the country
[1:35:40.840 --> 1:35:42.840]  they're the second largest
[1:35:42.840 --> 1:35:44.840]  the NRA has millions of great members
[1:35:44.840 --> 1:35:46.840]  but they are a Trojan horse
[1:35:46.840 --> 1:35:48.840]  gun owners of America would never expose that
[1:35:48.840 --> 1:35:50.840]  they wanted to be nice
[1:35:50.840 --> 1:35:52.840]  until last year their board said
[1:35:52.840 --> 1:35:54.840]  let's just go public with all their own documents
[1:35:54.840 --> 1:35:58.840]  they've written articles showing their own quotes about how they are for gun control
[1:35:58.840 --> 1:36:00.840]  they are the authors of gun control
[1:36:00.840 --> 1:36:04.840]  so all NRA members must get out of the NRA now
[1:36:04.840 --> 1:36:06.840]  and they must go support gun owners
[1:36:06.840 --> 1:36:09.840]  they've tripled the size of the BATF
[1:36:09.840 --> 1:36:12.840]  we are in the fight of our lives for the Second Amendment
[1:36:12.840 --> 1:36:15.840]  and the media and the gun grabbers have gotten slick
[1:36:15.840 --> 1:36:18.840]  just like Bush during the 2004 election
[1:36:18.840 --> 1:36:21.840]  got up and said
[1:36:21.840 --> 1:36:24.840]  I am for the Second Amendment individual right to keep bare arms
[1:36:24.840 --> 1:36:27.840]  and the Justice Department said well he clarifies
[1:36:27.840 --> 1:36:31.840]  if prescribed by law and that law can curtail it
[1:36:31.840 --> 1:36:33.840]  well that's what the Supreme Court is saying
[1:36:33.840 --> 1:36:35.840]  but they've never had the Supreme Court say that
[1:36:35.840 --> 1:36:37.840]  this will be the Supreme Court action
[1:36:37.840 --> 1:36:39.840]  now we'll see if Larry Pratt disagrees with me
[1:36:39.840 --> 1:36:41.840]  and I know he wants to be positive but Larry
[1:36:41.840 --> 1:36:43.840]  I spent two hours last night reading this
[1:36:43.840 --> 1:36:45.840]  and I couldn't sleep last night Larry
[1:36:45.840 --> 1:36:49.840]  well Alex I think your characterization is quite spot on
[1:36:49.840 --> 1:36:51.840]  and it made me all the happier
[1:36:51.840 --> 1:36:55.840]  when I was listening to that proceeding
[1:36:55.840 --> 1:36:59.840]  to know that we had our own brief before the court
[1:36:59.840 --> 1:37:02.840]  by the way people can find that at gunowners.org
[1:37:02.840 --> 1:37:04.840]  it's right there on our home page
[1:37:04.840 --> 1:37:07.840]  we made the point that
[1:37:07.840 --> 1:37:09.840]  well in fact we knew that there'd be a problem
[1:37:09.840 --> 1:37:13.840]  with trying to define a way
[1:37:13.840 --> 1:37:16.840]  slice away the true meaning of the Second Amendment
[1:37:16.840 --> 1:37:19.840]  and it doesn't give us any reassurance at all
[1:37:19.840 --> 1:37:22.840]  to hear people celebrate oh the judges are going to
[1:37:22.840 --> 1:37:25.840]  determine that we do have an individual right
[1:37:25.840 --> 1:37:27.840]  to keep and bear arms after all
[1:37:27.840 --> 1:37:29.840]  that argument will be over
[1:37:29.840 --> 1:37:31.840]  well actually that may be true
[1:37:31.840 --> 1:37:34.840]  that argument may be over however
[1:37:34.840 --> 1:37:37.840]  but the big word
[1:37:37.840 --> 1:37:39.840]  this is not the end of the issue
[1:37:39.840 --> 1:37:41.840]  as far as their concern on the court
[1:37:41.840 --> 1:37:44.840]  because they spent a fair amount of time
[1:37:44.840 --> 1:37:47.840]  as you know Alex discussing
[1:37:47.840 --> 1:37:49.840]  whether we should have this or that
[1:37:49.840 --> 1:37:51.840]  or the other level of scrutiny
[1:37:51.840 --> 1:37:55.840]  is lawyer talk for how far away from the Constitution
[1:37:55.840 --> 1:37:59.840]  can we make a ruling before we get run out of town on a rail
[1:37:59.840 --> 1:38:03.840]  and they were arguing in the Bush brief
[1:38:03.840 --> 1:38:06.840]  and I think there could possibly be support
[1:38:06.840 --> 1:38:09.840]  for agreeing with the Bush brief
[1:38:09.840 --> 1:38:12.840]  because that's something that the conservatives
[1:38:12.840 --> 1:38:14.840]  on the court tend to do
[1:38:14.840 --> 1:38:17.840]  big government conservatives I guess we could say
[1:38:17.840 --> 1:38:21.840]  that well let's use the lowest level
[1:38:21.840 --> 1:38:24.840]  of scrutiny meaning let's get as far away
[1:38:24.840 --> 1:38:26.840]  from the Constitution as possible
[1:38:26.840 --> 1:38:28.840]  and there was even discussion yesterday
[1:38:28.840 --> 1:38:31.840]  about the founders idea
[1:38:31.840 --> 1:38:33.840]  of the level of scrutiny
[1:38:33.840 --> 1:38:35.840]  shall not be infringed
[1:38:35.840 --> 1:38:38.840]  we didn't think that the judges
[1:38:38.840 --> 1:38:40.840]  may have been familiar with that word
[1:38:40.840 --> 1:38:43.840]  so we went back to an 1828 dictionary
[1:38:43.840 --> 1:38:45.840]  and we put the definition of infringed
[1:38:45.840 --> 1:38:47.840]  in our brief just so they would
[1:38:47.840 --> 1:38:50.840]  you know have that hand it means don't touch it
[1:38:50.840 --> 1:38:52.840]  yeah keep your hands off
[1:38:52.840 --> 1:38:55.840]  it's real plain and we
[1:38:55.840 --> 1:38:57.840]  we are concerned that there was discussion
[1:38:57.840 --> 1:38:59.840]  during the hearing about
[1:38:59.840 --> 1:39:01.840]  well does it actually mean
[1:39:01.840 --> 1:39:03.840]  then Mr. Counsel for Heller
[1:39:03.840 --> 1:39:05.840]  and DC versus Heller
[1:39:05.840 --> 1:39:07.840]  does it really mean shall not be
[1:39:07.840 --> 1:39:10.840]  unreasonably infringed
[1:39:10.840 --> 1:39:12.840]  and he sort of agreed with that
[1:39:12.840 --> 1:39:15.840]  well yeah it wouldn't preclude banning machine guns
[1:39:15.840 --> 1:39:18.840]  it wouldn't preclude licensing gun owners
[1:39:18.840 --> 1:39:20.840]  well there's the ballgame right there
[1:39:20.840 --> 1:39:22.840]  they license gun owners in New York City
[1:39:22.840 --> 1:39:24.840]  try to get it
[1:39:24.840 --> 1:39:26.840]  well I mean I've got one of the quotes here
[1:39:26.840 --> 1:39:28.840]  and that's the problem it's 90-something pages
[1:39:28.840 --> 1:39:30.840]  just reading the oral arguments in the justice's comments
[1:39:30.840 --> 1:39:32.840]  but I've got multiple justices saying
[1:39:32.840 --> 1:39:34.840]  I don't see a problem with banning all handguns
[1:39:34.840 --> 1:39:36.840]  I don't see a problem
[1:39:36.840 --> 1:39:38.840]  you know yeah you can have a right
[1:39:38.840 --> 1:39:40.840]  but basically they're saying locked up
[1:39:40.840 --> 1:39:42.840]  at a gun club
[1:39:42.840 --> 1:39:44.840]  where you can go out with an instructor
[1:39:44.840 --> 1:39:46.840]  over you and shoot your gun once a week
[1:39:46.840 --> 1:39:48.840]  sure because if you're concerned about your own defense
[1:39:48.840 --> 1:39:50.840]  we'll then call 9-11
[1:39:50.840 --> 1:39:52.840]  and of course as our friends at Jews
[1:39:52.840 --> 1:39:54.840]  for preservation of firearms ownership
[1:39:54.840 --> 1:39:56.840]  entitled one of their books
[1:39:56.840 --> 1:39:58.840]  9-11 and die
[1:39:58.840 --> 1:40:00.840]  because by the time the cops get there that's what's going to happen
[1:40:00.840 --> 1:40:02.840]  Larry I'm going to put a call to action out here
[1:40:02.840 --> 1:40:04.840]  and
[1:40:04.840 --> 1:40:06.840]  I'm so angry I literally feel like
[1:40:06.840 --> 1:40:08.840]  taking my broadcast chair and throwing it through the broadcast window
[1:40:08.840 --> 1:40:10.840]  right now
[1:40:10.840 --> 1:40:12.840]  because
[1:40:12.840 --> 1:40:14.840]  the second amendment is so clear
[1:40:14.840 --> 1:40:16.840]  the founding fathers, the debates
[1:40:16.840 --> 1:40:18.840]  the Federalist Papers, the Anti-Federalist Papers
[1:40:18.840 --> 1:40:20.840]  this is one of the few issues where there was
[1:40:20.840 --> 1:40:22.840]  universal agreement
[1:40:22.840 --> 1:40:24.840]  it is an individual right mainly against
[1:40:24.840 --> 1:40:26.840]  tyrannical government
[1:40:26.840 --> 1:40:28.840]  they have no power to restrict
[1:40:28.840 --> 1:40:30.840]  the areas where they have no gun laws
[1:40:30.840 --> 1:40:32.840]  and there are places people think we'd have bedlam and death
[1:40:32.840 --> 1:40:34.840]  there are places where there are no gun laws
[1:40:34.840 --> 1:40:36.840]  state laws
[1:40:36.840 --> 1:40:38.840]  like Vermont, like
[1:40:38.840 --> 1:40:40.840]  Alaska, like most of Montana
[1:40:40.840 --> 1:40:42.840]  exactly and those are the lowest crime rates
[1:40:42.840 --> 1:40:44.840]  even in big urban centers
[1:40:44.840 --> 1:40:46.840]  in the country
[1:40:46.840 --> 1:40:48.840]  and we have the facts, we know the truth
[1:40:48.840 --> 1:40:50.840]  and we know the globalists want our guns
[1:40:50.840 --> 1:40:52.840]  I want to call to action and I'm telling everybody right now
[1:40:52.840 --> 1:40:54.840]  we're going to write articles
[1:40:54.840 --> 1:40:56.840]  at infowars.com
[1:40:56.840 --> 1:40:58.840]  we're going to write articles at prisonplanet.com
[1:40:58.840 --> 1:41:00.840]  Larry we need you to come out now
[1:41:00.840 --> 1:41:02.840]  I know you are, come out now put in articles
[1:41:02.840 --> 1:41:04.840]  we get out to everybody explaining
[1:41:04.840 --> 1:41:06.840]  I have the hoax
[1:41:06.840 --> 1:41:08.840]  I have the New York law journal
[1:41:08.840 --> 1:41:10.840]  I have Washington Post, AP, Reuters
[1:41:10.840 --> 1:41:12.840]  I mean you type this in
[1:41:12.840 --> 1:41:14.840]  Supreme Court Second Amendment
[1:41:14.840 --> 1:41:16.840]  hundreds of articles all saying we've won
[1:41:16.840 --> 1:41:18.840]  and that is an enemy tactic
[1:41:18.840 --> 1:41:20.840]  they always use and they do it more and more
[1:41:20.840 --> 1:41:22.840]  now to just say go back to sleep
[1:41:22.840 --> 1:41:24.840]  go back to sleep
[1:41:24.840 --> 1:41:26.840]  and meanwhile they've always been criminal
[1:41:26.840 --> 1:41:28.840]  they've always been in the wrong
[1:41:28.840 --> 1:41:30.840]  they've never had a Supreme Court ruling saying
[1:41:30.840 --> 1:41:32.840]  they can touch any of our guns
[1:41:32.840 --> 1:41:34.840]  there are five justices
[1:41:34.840 --> 1:41:36.840]  talk about a trojan horse
[1:41:36.840 --> 1:41:38.840]  and there you go Scalia who believes in hunting
[1:41:38.840 --> 1:41:40.840]  you know and then he makes a statement
[1:41:40.840 --> 1:41:42.840]  about well you know I think
[1:41:42.840 --> 1:41:44.840]  we need this for hunting
[1:41:44.840 --> 1:41:46.840]  I mean folks they are coming after you
[1:41:46.840 --> 1:41:48.840]  this is it and they're now going to say
[1:41:48.840 --> 1:41:50.840]  well the Supreme Court said you've got a right
[1:41:50.840 --> 1:41:52.840]  but we say what that right is
[1:41:52.840 --> 1:41:54.840]  Larry what do we do we've got a
[1:41:54.840 --> 1:41:56.840]  emergency
[1:41:56.840 --> 1:41:58.840]  I mean you can't wait you've got to call everybody
[1:41:58.840 --> 1:42:00.840]  you know that's an NRA member
[1:42:00.840 --> 1:42:02.840]  I'm bagging you email every day
[1:42:02.840 --> 1:42:04.840]  to everybody you know for six months straight
[1:42:04.840 --> 1:42:06.840]  we've got to let people know
[1:42:06.840 --> 1:42:08.840]  that this is it
[1:42:08.840 --> 1:42:10.840]  I mean this is the biggest attack
[1:42:10.840 --> 1:42:12.840]  on the Second Amendment in our
[1:42:12.840 --> 1:42:14.840]  233 year history
[1:42:14.840 --> 1:42:16.840]  well the first thing that we're going to be doing
[1:42:16.840 --> 1:42:18.840]  is putting out an email alert
[1:42:18.840 --> 1:42:20.840]  probably go out tomorrow
[1:42:20.840 --> 1:42:22.840]  giving people a wrap up of what happened
[1:42:22.840 --> 1:42:24.840]  and the kind of analysis that you're talking about
[1:42:24.840 --> 1:42:26.840]  so that people realize
[1:42:26.840 --> 1:42:28.840]  that this is not the time to go to sleep
[1:42:28.840 --> 1:42:30.840]  we're going to show we actually got
[1:42:30.840 --> 1:42:32.840]  an op-ed in USA Today
[1:42:32.840 --> 1:42:34.840]  of all places that our attorneys
[1:42:34.840 --> 1:42:36.840]  were able to write
[1:42:36.840 --> 1:42:38.840]  and they made the arguments that should have
[1:42:38.840 --> 1:42:40.840]  been made by Mr. Heller's
[1:42:40.840 --> 1:42:42.840]  attorney before the court
[1:42:42.840 --> 1:42:44.840]  that if any
[1:42:44.840 --> 1:42:46.840]  gun is protected by the Second Amendment
[1:42:46.840 --> 1:42:48.840]  it's the M16
[1:42:48.840 --> 1:42:50.840]  Army rifle
[1:42:50.840 --> 1:42:52.840]  machine gun
[1:42:52.840 --> 1:42:54.840]  that's because it's the direct lineal
[1:42:54.840 --> 1:42:56.840]  descendant of what they were using
[1:42:56.840 --> 1:42:58.840]  at the time of the framing
[1:42:58.840 --> 1:43:00.840]  of the Constitution and of the Bill of Rights
[1:43:00.840 --> 1:43:02.840]  and so
[1:43:02.840 --> 1:43:04.840]  we took that head on and pointed out
[1:43:04.840 --> 1:43:06.840]  that it shall not be
[1:43:06.840 --> 1:43:08.840]  infringed means no
[1:43:08.840 --> 1:43:10.840]  let me just say this, let me just say this
[1:43:10.840 --> 1:43:12.840]  we have a lot of listeners that have a lot of money
[1:43:12.840 --> 1:43:14.840]  don't send me money, don't give me money
[1:43:14.840 --> 1:43:16.840]  if you want to give it to Larry that's fine
[1:43:16.840 --> 1:43:18.840]  but tell them what you want it for
[1:43:18.840 --> 1:43:20.840]  we need people to take
[1:43:20.840 --> 1:43:22.840]  simple articles that have four to five
[1:43:22.840 --> 1:43:24.840]  founding father quotes
[1:43:24.840 --> 1:43:26.840]  the Supreme Court is running a giant con job
[1:43:26.840 --> 1:43:28.840]  they're about to rule
[1:43:28.840 --> 1:43:30.840]  that you have a right but that they can restrict it
[1:43:30.840 --> 1:43:32.840]  that is a fraud if they do that
[1:43:32.840 --> 1:43:34.840]  it'll be just like New York City 50 years ago
[1:43:34.840 --> 1:43:36.840]  where they say you have a right
[1:43:36.840 --> 1:43:38.840]  but we can restrict it and then they just
[1:43:38.840 --> 1:43:40.840]  don't issue the permits
[1:43:40.840 --> 1:43:42.840]  exactly what licensing
[1:43:42.840 --> 1:43:44.840]  is all about
[1:43:44.840 --> 1:43:46.840]  I'm telling you, listeners that have money
[1:43:46.840 --> 1:43:48.840]  and I know we got them and I'm too busy to even call you up
[1:43:48.840 --> 1:43:50.840]  okay and you know who you are out there
[1:43:50.840 --> 1:43:52.840]  I'm going to try to put something together
[1:43:52.840 --> 1:43:54.840]  Larry, if people were to call you
[1:43:54.840 --> 1:43:56.840]  and say I want to give you
[1:43:56.840 --> 1:43:58.840]  $100,000
[1:43:58.840 --> 1:44:00.840]  for full page ads
[1:44:00.840 --> 1:44:02.840]  in the Washington Times
[1:44:02.840 --> 1:44:04.840]  Washington Post
[1:44:04.840 --> 1:44:06.840]  so we can email and fax
[1:44:06.840 --> 1:44:08.840]  10,000 copies to the Supreme Court
[1:44:08.840 --> 1:44:10.840]  so they're knee deep
[1:44:10.840 --> 1:44:12.840]  I think that's the type of aggressive stuff
[1:44:12.840 --> 1:44:14.840]  we got to get in the streets, we got to put a call
[1:44:14.840 --> 1:44:16.840]  out to the NRA members
[1:44:16.840 --> 1:44:18.840]  to realize they're being Judas coated
[1:44:18.840 --> 1:44:20.840]  I mean this is the Alamo
[1:44:20.840 --> 1:44:22.840]  they're coming over the walls
[1:44:22.840 --> 1:44:24.840]  this is it!
[1:44:24.840 --> 1:44:26.840]  This is an amazing day that we had
[1:44:26.840 --> 1:44:28.840]  before us yesterday
[1:44:28.840 --> 1:44:30.840]  and I think it's very concerning
[1:44:30.840 --> 1:44:32.840]  I don't think you're exaggerating this
[1:44:32.840 --> 1:44:34.840]  one bit
[1:44:34.840 --> 1:44:36.840]  we are in trouble
[1:44:36.840 --> 1:44:38.840]  oh my god
[1:44:38.840 --> 1:44:40.840]  but they're slicker than they were in the 90s and 80s Larry
[1:44:40.840 --> 1:44:42.840]  very slick
[1:44:42.840 --> 1:44:44.840]  it's right out of George Orwell's
[1:44:44.840 --> 1:44:46.840]  1984 novel
[1:44:46.840 --> 1:44:48.840]  where freedom is slavery
[1:44:48.840 --> 1:44:50.840]  and
[1:44:50.840 --> 1:44:52.840]  what war
[1:44:52.840 --> 1:44:54.840]  is peace all those kinds of
[1:44:54.840 --> 1:44:56.840]  inversions of the plain meanings of words
[1:44:56.840 --> 1:44:58.840]  and in this case
[1:44:58.840 --> 1:45:00.840]  yeah it's an individual right but
[1:45:00.840 --> 1:45:02.840]  well it's like the First Amendment
[1:45:02.840 --> 1:45:04.840]  Congress shall make no law respect
[1:45:04.840 --> 1:45:06.840]  Congress shall make no law respecting
[1:45:06.840 --> 1:45:08.840]  the establishment of religion
[1:45:08.840 --> 1:45:10.840]  prohibiting the free exercise thereof
[1:45:10.840 --> 1:45:12.840]  then it goes into press assembly
[1:45:12.840 --> 1:45:14.840]  and now what they've done with the First Amendment
[1:45:14.840 --> 1:45:16.840]  is stick in effect the word
[1:45:16.840 --> 1:45:18.840]  probably
[1:45:18.840 --> 1:45:20.840]  Congress shall pass no unreasonable
[1:45:20.840 --> 1:45:22.840]  law regarding
[1:45:22.840 --> 1:45:24.840]  and so they control what you can establish
[1:45:24.840 --> 1:45:26.840]  they control what you can say
[1:45:26.840 --> 1:45:28.840]  you didn't know this America
[1:45:28.840 --> 1:45:30.840]  they run it all
[1:45:30.840 --> 1:45:32.840]  the courts have been ruling there's no Fourth Amendment
[1:45:32.840 --> 1:45:34.840]  for spying
[1:45:34.840 --> 1:45:36.840]  I mean it's all happening
[1:45:36.840 --> 1:45:38.840]  I just can't believe it
[1:45:38.840 --> 1:45:40.840]  well it's
[1:45:40.840 --> 1:45:42.840]  an opportunity that we have to educate
[1:45:42.840 --> 1:45:44.840]  people because I think
[1:45:44.840 --> 1:45:46.840]  the issue was made very clear yesterday
[1:45:46.840 --> 1:45:48.840]  and when the good guys
[1:45:48.840 --> 1:45:50.840]  were making arguments
[1:45:50.840 --> 1:45:52.840]  in effect throwing in the towel
[1:45:52.840 --> 1:45:54.840]  and saying there's no principled
[1:45:54.840 --> 1:45:56.840]  constitutional basis for opposing
[1:45:56.840 --> 1:45:58.840]  gun control then I think
[1:45:58.840 --> 1:46:00.840]  you realize we have
[1:46:00.840 --> 1:46:02.840]  come to a very dangerous point
[1:46:02.840 --> 1:46:04.840]  look something this big
[1:46:04.840 --> 1:46:06.840]  look I knew this was rigged from the beginning
[1:46:06.840 --> 1:46:08.840]  I know you want to look fair and
[1:46:08.840 --> 1:46:10.840]  reserve judgment but
[1:46:10.840 --> 1:46:12.840]  the Supreme Court has refused all the real
[1:46:12.840 --> 1:46:14.840]  cases that were brought to it
[1:46:14.840 --> 1:46:16.840]  they accepted this because it's rigged
[1:46:16.840 --> 1:46:18.840]  and that's what the ACLU and others
[1:46:18.840 --> 1:46:20.840]  have done with other cases is they're there
[1:46:20.840 --> 1:46:22.840]  to create bad case law
[1:46:22.840 --> 1:46:24.840]  and the same thing here and I'll call
[1:46:24.840 --> 1:46:26.840]  a spade a spade you read
[1:46:26.840 --> 1:46:28.840]  what the
[1:46:28.840 --> 1:46:30.840]  the main brief that they accepted
[1:46:30.840 --> 1:46:32.840]  and you read them saying we agree
[1:46:32.840 --> 1:46:34.840]  you're allowed to restrict guns, ban guns, control guns
[1:46:34.840 --> 1:46:36.840]  we're for gun control
[1:46:36.840 --> 1:46:38.840]  the Second Amendment means gun control
[1:46:38.840 --> 1:46:40.840]  that's the good guys
[1:46:40.840 --> 1:46:42.840]  the Supreme Court goes you're right
[1:46:42.840 --> 1:46:44.840]  we're going to rule you have a Second Amendment
[1:46:44.840 --> 1:46:46.840]  a right for us to take your guns
[1:46:46.840 --> 1:46:48.840]  this is it folks
[1:46:48.840 --> 1:46:50.840]  it's going to happen and the NRA
[1:46:50.840 --> 1:46:52.840]  is going to tell all their members it's a victory
[1:46:52.840 --> 1:46:54.840]  and Judas go to all of you
[1:46:54.840 --> 1:46:56.840]  I think people would like looking at
[1:46:56.840 --> 1:46:58.840]  our brief because one of the things that we
[1:46:58.840 --> 1:47:00.840]  point out in there and it
[1:47:00.840 --> 1:47:02.840]  kind of got right up in their face it said
[1:47:02.840 --> 1:47:04.840]  look the founders generation
[1:47:04.840 --> 1:47:06.840]  after suffering a long
[1:47:06.840 --> 1:47:08.840]  train of abuses that's a quote from
[1:47:08.840 --> 1:47:10.840]  of course the declaration
[1:47:10.840 --> 1:47:12.840]  and having heard their petitions go
[1:47:12.840 --> 1:47:14.840]  unanswered by the crown
[1:47:14.840 --> 1:47:16.840]  we're forced to resort to arms
[1:47:16.840 --> 1:47:18.840]  in order to shoot back
[1:47:18.840 --> 1:47:20.840]  so to this generation
[1:47:20.840 --> 1:47:22.840]  is watching what you will do
[1:47:22.840 --> 1:47:24.840]  on this court
[1:47:24.840 --> 1:47:26.840]  absolutely and they know
[1:47:26.840 --> 1:47:28.840]  how to move incrementally so we never physically
[1:47:28.840 --> 1:47:30.840]  resist them Larry I'm here frothing
[1:47:30.840 --> 1:47:32.840]  and ranting and raving
[1:47:32.840 --> 1:47:34.840]  do we have any prayer in hell
[1:47:34.840 --> 1:47:36.840]  you know bushes sign more gun control
[1:47:36.840 --> 1:47:38.840]  do we have any prayer
[1:47:38.840 --> 1:47:40.840]  I think we should try we don't
[1:47:40.840 --> 1:47:42.840]  duty is ours consequence belongs to God
[1:47:42.840 --> 1:47:44.840]  we need to go get your
[1:47:44.840 --> 1:47:46.840]  brief and I want every listener in Virginia
[1:47:46.840 --> 1:47:48.840]  Maryland surrounding areas
[1:47:48.840 --> 1:47:50.840]  Connecticut New Hampshire I want you to drive
[1:47:50.840 --> 1:47:52.840]  the DC and I want you to hand deliver
[1:47:52.840 --> 1:47:54.840]  to them I want you to send
[1:47:54.840 --> 1:47:56.840]  registered mail the brief
[1:47:56.840 --> 1:47:58.840]  I want to make sure
[1:47:58.840 --> 1:48:00.840]  that and founding father quotes
[1:48:00.840 --> 1:48:02.840]  I think we should all mail
[1:48:02.840 --> 1:48:04.840]  hundreds of copies of founding father
[1:48:04.840 --> 1:48:06.840]  quotes and then send dozens of copies
[1:48:06.840 --> 1:48:08.840]  of peace registered mail what do you
[1:48:08.840 --> 1:48:10.840]  say sir I think
[1:48:10.840 --> 1:48:12.840]  that could conceivably
[1:48:12.840 --> 1:48:14.840]  have some impact the clerks will
[1:48:14.840 --> 1:48:16.840]  certainly know that that mail is coming
[1:48:16.840 --> 1:48:18.840]  in there's no official way
[1:48:18.840 --> 1:48:20.840]  to affect what the court thinks
[1:48:20.840 --> 1:48:22.840]  and their criminals but
[1:48:22.840 --> 1:48:24.840]  you know
[1:48:24.840 --> 1:48:26.840]  I think that needs to be done they
[1:48:26.840 --> 1:48:28.840]  they need to realize
[1:48:28.840 --> 1:48:30.840]  that they're sitting on a powder cake
[1:48:30.840 --> 1:48:32.840]  and if they
[1:48:32.840 --> 1:48:34.840]  they go ahead and do something slick
[1:48:34.840 --> 1:48:36.840]  like this and basically
[1:48:36.840 --> 1:48:38.840]  give with one hand and take away with the other
[1:48:38.840 --> 1:48:40.840]  they might
[1:48:40.840 --> 1:48:42.840]  just be injecting something into this election
[1:48:42.840 --> 1:48:44.840]  campaign and more even
[1:48:44.840 --> 1:48:46.840]  and into the very
[1:48:46.840 --> 1:48:48.840]  society that we're living in
[1:48:48.840 --> 1:48:50.840]  right now where people are just going to have
[1:48:50.840 --> 1:48:52.840]  had it
[1:48:54.840 --> 1:48:56.840]  you're absolutely right folks we have
[1:48:56.840 --> 1:48:58.840]  to become a battle plan we have to institute it
[1:48:58.840 --> 1:49:00.840]  we cannot wait for orders from headquarters
[1:49:00.840 --> 1:49:02.840]  Larry
[1:49:02.840 --> 1:49:04.840]  we need to get ads
[1:49:04.840 --> 1:49:06.840]  in the DC papers and
[1:49:06.840 --> 1:49:08.840]  I like your brief because you don't kiss their
[1:49:08.840 --> 1:49:10.840]  hind end you say look
[1:49:10.840 --> 1:49:12.840]  we know you're an enemy but just go ahead and run your flag
[1:49:12.840 --> 1:49:14.840]  up and let us know your traders
[1:49:14.840 --> 1:49:16.840]  I mean we ought to just have a
[1:49:16.840 --> 1:49:18.840]  look we need to let them know we're going to move
[1:49:18.840 --> 1:49:20.840]  for their impeachment and I mean we're going to
[1:49:20.840 --> 1:49:22.840]  understand their double talk
[1:49:22.840 --> 1:49:24.840]  we're not going to be lulled and go back
[1:49:24.840 --> 1:49:26.840]  to sleep so if they do something
[1:49:26.840 --> 1:49:28.840]  slick like most of those lawyers
[1:49:28.840 --> 1:49:30.840]  we're urging we're not going to buy it
[1:49:30.840 --> 1:49:32.840]  well you know what's going to happen
[1:49:32.840 --> 1:49:34.840]  the lawyers for the second
[1:49:34.840 --> 1:49:36.840]  amendment are Judas
[1:49:36.840 --> 1:49:38.840]  there is no doubt about it
[1:49:38.840 --> 1:49:40.840]  and
[1:49:40.840 --> 1:49:42.840]  oh my god it's all over
[1:49:42.840 --> 1:49:44.840]  oh my god
[1:49:44.840 --> 1:49:46.840]  well they were
[1:49:46.840 --> 1:49:48.840]  the best I can tell you is that they were
[1:49:48.840 --> 1:49:50.840]  embarrassed ashamed
[1:49:50.840 --> 1:49:52.840]  as a lawyer to make an argument
[1:49:52.840 --> 1:49:54.840]  that the second amendment
[1:49:54.840 --> 1:49:56.840]  means what it means and it's there ultimately
[1:49:56.840 --> 1:49:58.840]  to protect
[1:49:58.840 --> 1:50:00.840]  individuals against the government
[1:50:00.840 --> 1:50:02.840]  and if the individuals have to
[1:50:02.840 --> 1:50:04.840]  organize as the militia
[1:50:04.840 --> 1:50:06.840]  that's what our founding fathers
[1:50:06.840 --> 1:50:08.840]  did well
[1:50:08.840 --> 1:50:10.840]  well look America is worth it
[1:50:10.840 --> 1:50:12.840]  our history our heritage our defense

[1:50:24.840 --> 1:50:26.840]  because they say
[1:50:26.840 --> 1:50:28.840]  the snibbling lawyers for the second amendment say
[1:50:28.840 --> 1:50:30.840]  oh we agree you can restrict guns
