[00:00.000 --> 00:22.860]  The world is being artificially put into a cascade of crises that will lead to the accelerated
[00:22.860 --> 00:28.520]  controlled collapse and the mass death of billions upon billions of people.
[00:28.520 --> 00:37.560]  New York City, in the year 2022, nothing runs anymore, nothing works, but the people
[00:37.560 --> 00:41.720]  are the same and the people will do anything to get what they need.
[00:41.720 --> 00:43.040]  This is the police.
[00:43.040 --> 00:45.560]  What they need most is Soil and Green.
[00:45.560 --> 00:49.560]  The fly of Soil and Green has been exhausted.
[00:49.560 --> 00:55.000]  They can try to ignore the general public, ignore this scientist, this doctor, this study,
[00:55.000 --> 00:59.640]  so when you have a major respect government, the Japanese are smart as you get.
[00:59.640 --> 01:03.040]  Say okay, this is causing heart attacks in myocarditis at a very high level.
[01:03.040 --> 01:04.040]  It's not rare.
[01:04.040 --> 01:05.960]  That validates the mountains of other evidence.
[01:05.960 --> 01:10.160]  Well, if you're a biologist, we could potentially be sterilizing an entire generation with COVID
[01:10.160 --> 01:11.160]  vaccines.
[01:11.160 --> 01:12.160]  Yeah, that's what we know it's doing.
[01:12.160 --> 01:13.680]  Now it's all confirmed.
[01:13.680 --> 01:22.000]  First batch of Pfizer's COVID-19 vaccine documents revealed 42,000 reaction reports, 101,223 deaths
[01:22.000 --> 01:24.120]  just in the first few weeks of it.
[01:24.120 --> 01:25.840]  The die-offs are accelerating.
[01:25.840 --> 01:28.000]  The stillbirths are accelerating.
[01:28.000 --> 01:33.720]  The establishment hasn't been able to achieve what they wanted with the Omicron Hysteria,
[01:33.720 --> 01:36.280]  and so they're going to play another card.
[01:36.280 --> 01:42.040]  And the card that it looks like they're going to play sometime in 2022 is the false flagged
[01:42.040 --> 01:44.440]  cyber attack on the financial infrastructure.
[01:44.440 --> 01:49.400]  When you talk about something like cyber warfare, it's actually quite cheap and quite easy for
[01:49.400 --> 01:53.920]  a country to develop a cyber weapon, and that cyber weapon can have equivalent effects.
[01:53.920 --> 01:57.800]  You could have a cyber weapon potentially shut down the power grid, for example, on
[01:57.800 --> 01:59.920]  the whole East Coast.
[01:59.920 --> 02:01.080]  New York is out.
[02:01.080 --> 02:02.080]  Wall Street is out.
[02:02.080 --> 02:03.200]  All your banks are out.
[02:03.200 --> 02:04.200]  You can't even withdraw money.
[02:04.200 --> 02:08.480]  You know, you can imagine people panic starting and people trying to get cash.
[02:08.480 --> 02:09.480]  You can't get cash.
[02:09.480 --> 02:11.200]  ATMs aren't working.
[02:11.200 --> 02:13.760]  Then things like your water waste procurement plants aren't working.
[02:13.760 --> 02:14.760]  It's no clean water.
[02:14.760 --> 02:16.400]  There's going to be a run on stores.
[02:16.400 --> 02:17.680]  Stores potentially aren't even operating.
[02:17.680 --> 02:19.520]  Your credit card is not going to work at the store.
[02:19.520 --> 02:22.320]  There'll be absolutely mass panic.
[02:22.320 --> 02:27.920]  If you can blind the U.S. military, if you can shut down our GPS and our computer networks,
[02:27.920 --> 02:30.960]  our military is basically unable to function.
[02:30.960 --> 02:34.960]  And what most people aren't thinking about that's on my mind right now, Alex, is the
[02:34.960 --> 02:41.160]  social chaos implications of the freezing of the financial infrastructure in America.
[02:41.160 --> 02:46.080]  I think it's the union leader for the L.A. police saying, don't come to L.A. That's
[02:46.080 --> 02:49.200]  the beginning of what's going to be really no-go zones.
[02:49.200 --> 02:52.640]  My message to anybody considering coming to Los Angeles, especially during the holiday
[02:52.640 --> 02:53.960]  season, is don't.
[02:53.960 --> 02:55.880]  We can't guarantee your safety.
[02:55.880 --> 02:57.640]  It is really, really out of control.
[02:57.640 --> 03:01.680]  You know, I said it to people before, it's like that movie Purge.
[03:01.680 --> 03:07.560]  You know, instead of 24 hours to commit your crime, these bad people have 365 days to commit
[03:07.560 --> 03:08.560]  whatever they want.
[03:08.560 --> 03:14.840]  They may at some point tweet out a map of L.A. and they'll just draw, you know, 50
[03:14.840 --> 03:18.120]  square blocks and say, these are no-police zones.
[03:18.120 --> 03:23.840]  But what's going to trigger that is the freezing of the financial system, which could be engineered,
[03:23.840 --> 03:28.720]  and it could be used to blame it on China so that Biden can then go ahead and stage
[03:28.720 --> 03:34.360]  some kind of conflict with China and use that to declare domestic martial law under a wartime
[03:34.360 --> 03:35.360]  emergency.
[03:35.360 --> 03:38.640]  Remember, they have to have perpetual emergencies.
[03:38.640 --> 03:42.960]  And since the COVID emergency is kind of petering out, you know, people just aren't buying
[03:42.960 --> 03:47.960]  it anymore, they need another bigger emergency in order to keep people in line.
[03:47.960 --> 03:51.240]  And so war is one, financial collapse is one.
[03:51.240 --> 03:54.720]  But Alex, and you know this very well, your audience knows this, what happens when the
[03:54.720 --> 04:00.400]  food stamps stop working, when the ATMs stop working, when all transactions are frozen?
[04:00.400 --> 04:06.720]  What they want is for productive citizens to be gone and the actual income earners and
[04:06.720 --> 04:10.480]  producers in cities to flee, and that's happening right now.
[04:10.480 --> 04:15.160]  Well, I totally agree with you, and we're talking about escape from New York scenario,
[04:15.160 --> 04:18.680]  because there's a globalist plan to make much of the West no-go zones.
[04:18.680 --> 04:19.680]  This has been planned.
[04:19.680 --> 04:23.120]  Now, the police aren't in on this, they're just going to be put in a position where this
[04:23.120 --> 04:24.600]  is what's going to happen.
[04:24.600 --> 04:28.280]  They're being cut in half, they're being defunded, they're being told pullback, and this has
[04:28.280 --> 04:30.280]  all been part of the larger plan to collapse the country.
[04:30.280 --> 04:33.360]  And then the globalists go, oh, look, you collapsed on your own.
[04:33.360 --> 04:38.000]  As you mentioned, or get a little prelude to, the Communist Chinese dailies are all
[04:38.000 --> 04:42.000]  like, America's a race war, they're a failure, they're cities have collapsed, they're a joke.
[04:42.000 --> 04:49.240]  And then their clients, Bill Gates and their minions, like President Biden, are doing this.
[04:49.240 --> 04:54.480]  So this is a war, and COVID's a war, and the devaluing our currencies a war, and annihilating
[04:54.480 --> 04:55.640]  our borders is a war.
[04:55.640 --> 04:58.080]  I mean, the country is going down.
[04:58.080 --> 05:01.560]  Alex Jones here with us.
[05:01.560 --> 05:04.680]  Get our great bag of it here.
[05:04.680 --> 05:08.920]  I mean, this is from, people say, why is it from Chiapas, Mexico, the Communist?
[05:08.920 --> 05:13.360]  Well, that's where some of the best coffee in the world that's wild, harvested, above
[05:13.360 --> 05:16.720]  organic, in the volcanic soil, better than Guatemalan coffee.
[05:16.720 --> 05:20.040]  And yeah, we buy it from the little farmers that, you know, the media calls communists,
[05:20.040 --> 05:21.480]  but really, they're just a commune.
[05:21.480 --> 05:24.480]  And whatever the point is, is that it's good coffee, and we've got it.
[05:24.480 --> 05:26.520]  And the farmers don't let the Mexican government take over.
[05:26.520 --> 05:29.880]  So I actually buy this from the Mexican rebels, and I've been buying it for, what, 14 years,
[05:29.880 --> 05:31.080]  and the price has never gone up.
[05:31.080 --> 05:35.560]  The same stuff sold at Whole Foods under another name for about 50% more, for a pound, and I
[05:35.560 --> 05:37.960]  just think it's some of the best coffee you're going to find anywhere.
[05:37.960 --> 05:38.960]  Let's wake up America.
[05:38.960 --> 05:44.960]  Patriot blend from the Chiapas rebels, literally, in fact, I'm going to tell you a little story.
[05:44.960 --> 05:49.440]  We had like, you wouldn't believe it.
[05:49.440 --> 05:54.120]  Anyway, so it's infowarstore.com, and that's how we fund this operation.
[05:54.120 --> 06:14.360]  And if you don't find us, you don't want to share, that's fine.
[06:14.360 --> 06:42.400]  All wars, tomorrow's news, today.
[06:42.400 --> 06:49.240]  The images you're seeing, if you're a TV viewer, watching the radio show on broadcast, is spain,
[06:49.240 --> 06:57.640]  where hundreds of thousands filled city streets for miles chanting, Libertad, Libertad, which
[06:57.640 --> 07:05.640]  of course means, liberty in the Spanish or in the Latin, where the people stand up to
[07:05.640 --> 07:09.480]  their rights, there's liberty, where the people submit, there's tyranny, when the government
[07:09.480 --> 07:13.840]  fears the people, there is liberty, when the people fear the government, there is tyranny.
[07:13.840 --> 07:20.040]  This is a global corporate revolution against humanity to break our will, to cut us off
[07:20.040 --> 07:23.080]  from God, and to force us into the metaverse.
[07:23.080 --> 07:28.520]  I want to be extremely crystal clear about this.
[07:28.520 --> 07:35.080]  In all their admissions, in the DARPA documents with the 5G and other programs, it is to lock
[07:35.080 --> 07:40.840]  us in our houses, living inside virtual reality systems that we're forced into, to go to court,
[07:40.840 --> 07:46.840]  to go to the store, to buy, to sell, to work, but joy the public will not be allowed outside
[07:46.840 --> 07:51.480]  their homes, and then we will be, quote, forced into the artificial metaverse prison.
[07:51.480 --> 07:55.040]  It's already being done with school children, they're already saying you don't get trials
[07:55.040 --> 07:59.640]  in person, but you can do it from your jail cell.
[07:59.640 --> 08:05.520]  This is the prison planet being formed officially and being set up.
[08:05.520 --> 08:11.000]  What did I tell you 20 plus years ago, they are forming a prison planet, that's why in
[08:11.000 --> 08:17.120]  Australia and the US and the EU and the UK, laws were all passed in the last two years
[08:17.120 --> 08:24.000]  by law, by law.
[08:24.000 --> 08:29.920]  In 2024, all cars will have a tracker system in them, and they're going to start making
[08:29.920 --> 08:35.400]  older cars retrofitted that watches you, listens to you, has a breathalyzer, and reports back
[08:35.400 --> 08:38.760]  to big tech in the government what you're doing, where you're going, and what you're
[08:38.760 --> 08:41.200]  up to to be able to tax and control you with the carbon taxes.
[08:41.200 --> 08:45.120]  It's not just going to be home assistance inside your house watching and listening,
[08:45.120 --> 08:49.360]  it's not going to just be ring surveillance systems in your neighborhood that aren't really
[08:49.360 --> 08:53.320]  there to protect you, but are there to watch you.
[08:53.320 --> 08:58.640]  This is an AI takeover grid in their own admissions.
[08:58.640 --> 09:03.560]  This is the post industrial world being set up, and you notice the societies that submit,
[09:03.560 --> 09:07.920]  things only get worse, and the virus only gets worse, and the death only mounts, and
[09:07.920 --> 09:12.400]  the lockdowns only intensify, the more you're injected, the more you submit, the more you
[09:12.400 --> 09:13.400]  die.
[09:13.400 --> 09:19.320]  This is a kill operation, and now Fauci, and now the UK government, and the New Zealand
[09:19.320 --> 09:23.760]  government, the Australian government, the German government have announced, COVID injections
[09:23.760 --> 09:28.120]  are permanent, seven shots a year has been announced by Israel, it will be announced
[09:28.120 --> 09:32.760]  here soon, always six months after.
[09:32.760 --> 09:36.560]  Always raising the number, one shot, two shots, three shots, five shots, six shots, Bill
[09:36.560 --> 09:41.640]  Gates says it will be nine to 12 shots you'll be getting every year forcibly of a gene therapy
[09:41.640 --> 09:45.720]  that erases your immune system, and you say, well, they're going to get in trouble for
[09:45.720 --> 09:46.720]  killing everybody.
[09:46.720 --> 09:51.360]  Or not, they already killed tens of millions of people with poison vaccines over the last
[09:51.360 --> 09:56.200]  few decades, and hundreds of millions of autistic boys from the vaccines, and a cocktail of
[09:56.200 --> 10:04.920]  things, because the blood and brain barriers have as strong on a male as is on a female.
[10:04.920 --> 10:07.800]  We put up with that, and that was the test, okay?
[10:07.800 --> 10:12.120]  You let us test an experimental anthrax shots on the troops that killed over 30,000 of them
[10:12.120 --> 10:13.120]  on record.
[10:13.120 --> 10:17.200]  Now we'll just do it to everybody.
[10:17.200 --> 10:24.960]  Last week, the head Israeli scientist running the government said, seven shots and by Innoatech
[10:24.960 --> 10:32.640]  of Pfizer says now you need six shots, see how it works, and then in a few months it
[10:32.640 --> 10:37.920]  will be eight shots, and then 10 shots, then 12 shots, because what do the unvaccinated
[10:37.920 --> 10:41.640]  and the vaccinated have in common when it comes to COVID-19?
[10:41.640 --> 10:46.960]  They're never fully vaccinated, and the worst part about the 15 days to flatten the curve
[10:46.960 --> 10:52.360]  is the first two years.
[10:52.360 --> 10:58.000]  So they could kill 33,000-plus U.S. troops, certified, confirmed by Congress, much worse
[10:58.000 --> 11:07.400]  probably, of dying from the anthrax shot that didn't even protect them, and the two different
[11:07.400 --> 11:13.200]  rounds of those that went on, experimental unauthorized vaccine, then what can't they
[11:13.200 --> 11:14.200]  get away with?
[11:14.200 --> 11:16.080]  And the answer is the sky.
[11:16.080 --> 11:18.600]  The sky isn't even the beginning of the limit.
[11:18.600 --> 11:23.040]  We got a huge broadcast lined up for you today, and a lot of positive news, and fighting back.
[11:23.040 --> 11:30.480]  Texas creates hotline for employees to report workplace systems that are trying to require
[11:30.480 --> 11:35.400]  COVID-19 injections in total violation of federal state and the Nuremberg Code.
[11:35.400 --> 11:41.040]  Got the bad news, Julian Assange having a big stroke in his ninth year of solitary confinement
[11:41.040 --> 11:44.840]  for the thought of being a journalist.
[11:44.840 --> 11:50.200]  More coming out on CNN, and we put up the live show feed, got a very powerful headline
[11:50.200 --> 11:51.200]  up there today.
[11:51.200 --> 11:57.320]  I've told you that CNN is a globalist private intelligence agency that was actually working
[11:57.320 --> 12:02.240]  with Jeffrey Epstein, told you that many times, and that many of their producers and operatives
[12:02.240 --> 12:10.880]  actually are running groups of trained underage sex operatives to then go out and corrupt
[12:10.880 --> 12:14.240]  other individuals as part of these criminal networks.
[12:14.240 --> 12:15.560]  That's what Epstein especially was.
[12:15.560 --> 12:19.200]  He was just one of the superstars, you know, of that.
[12:19.200 --> 12:24.240]  He would be like Tom Brady's the superstar of NFL's, the greatest of all time.
[12:24.240 --> 12:29.440]  The greatest of all time was Gisling Maxwell's father, who ran Giant Child Kidnapping, Pedophile
[12:29.440 --> 12:35.000]  Rings for MI6 and OSS before that, and Mossad on record.
[12:35.000 --> 12:39.080]  And so she went and married the superstar that was like her daddy.
[12:39.080 --> 12:44.160]  Well, you got this big bust of Cuomo's producer luring women in who wanted their children
[12:44.160 --> 12:49.440]  to be sex slave operatives of CNN, and it's now coming out that that's what's happening.
[12:49.440 --> 12:52.200]  So they're having big problems hiding all this.
[12:52.200 --> 12:54.040]  We put the live show headline up for folks.
[12:54.040 --> 12:59.520]  I want to put the live show headline from infowars.com up for everybody.
[12:59.520 --> 13:00.520]  It's not up yet.
[13:00.520 --> 13:04.840]  Well, as soon as the live show feed headline goes up, we'll cover that and we'll read that
[13:04.840 --> 13:05.840]  for you.
[13:05.840 --> 13:07.720]  We're getting a lot of traffic on infowars.com today.
[13:07.720 --> 13:11.480]  I know I just tried to update it 10 minutes ago when I went live on air, so maybe the
[13:11.480 --> 13:17.520]  software and the server's a little bit sluggish because people are really hitting our servers
[13:17.520 --> 13:18.640]  in massive numbers.
[13:18.640 --> 13:19.640]  There it is.
[13:19.640 --> 13:27.400]  Today, emergency broadcast, Reset Wars is now live, globalist panic as CNN pedophile
[13:27.400 --> 13:30.920]  ring identified.
[13:30.920 --> 13:34.280]  So their whole great reset, their global lockdown, trying to put us under martial law, trying
[13:34.280 --> 13:38.760]  to scare us is in case we try to take our governments back peacefully and send them
[13:38.760 --> 13:40.640]  all to prison.
[13:40.640 --> 13:43.960]  So whether it's Zuckerberg or whether it's Fauci or whether it's Bill Gates, they're
[13:43.960 --> 13:47.720]  all in on it, ladies and gentlemen.
[13:47.720 --> 13:52.600]  Now they want to rape your children with these deadly chemical bio weapons, nanotech, then
[13:52.600 --> 13:56.800]  erases their immune system and gives them the equivalent of AIDS.
[13:56.800 --> 14:00.480]  We've got a bunch of mainline news on that, admitting the people that take the shot, take
[14:00.480 --> 14:06.000]  a second or third, then have an autoimmune disorder similar to HIV virus.
[14:06.000 --> 14:11.320]  It has part of the HIV virus in it, but it's not the full virus, but it causes the T cells
[14:11.320 --> 14:17.760]  to turn off the white blood cells and causes some very, very serious situations and the
[14:17.760 --> 14:19.640]  killer T cells as well.
[14:19.640 --> 14:27.280]  So that's all coming up here today, a very, very exciting announcement that I'll be getting
[14:27.280 --> 14:34.120]  more into in the bottom of the hour segment, about 15 minutes.

[14:53.920 --> 15:01.800]  minds, breaking down really the secrets of the actual nuts and bolts of real psychology,

[15:15.480 --> 15:19.080]  freaked out by this, they've already got a lot of publications attacking it and lying
[15:19.080 --> 15:28.640]  about it, they haven't seen it yet, and then Wednesday at 11.59 central, the six plus hour

[20:21.360 --> 20:30.760]  Welcome back to The Alex Jones Show.
[20:30.760 --> 20:35.280]  As regular listeners and viewers will know, I have really been not so much even targeting
[20:35.280 --> 20:36.280]  the globalists.
[20:36.280 --> 20:37.840]  We know Klaus Schwab and Bill Gates are evil.
[20:37.840 --> 20:44.280]  We know their puppet fraudulent president is Biden and is a joke, and so is Kamala Harris.
[20:44.280 --> 20:48.200]  It's important to point out their enemies of America and criminals, but they're front
[20:48.200 --> 20:49.200]  people.
[20:49.200 --> 20:54.120]  But instead of focusing only on them, how about President Trump coming out admitting
[20:54.120 --> 20:55.120]  he got conned?
[20:55.120 --> 20:58.880]  If this isn't a vaccine, it doesn't protect you and it doesn't work.
[20:58.880 --> 21:01.800]  Laura Ingraham's been having medical doctor guests on that say just that.
[21:01.800 --> 21:08.360]  In fact, it erases your immune system and is worse than not taking it.
[21:08.360 --> 21:13.320]  I played clips of Laura Ingraham last night with prestigious virologist and epidemiologist
[21:13.320 --> 21:20.480]  and immunologist that she's had on seeing exactly that because it's a fact.
[21:20.480 --> 21:22.440]  So he's a medical doctor.
[21:22.440 --> 21:23.440]  He knows all this.
[21:23.440 --> 21:24.440]  Rand Paul knows all this.
[21:24.440 --> 21:33.040]  So I'm more upset with Rand Paul than I am with Trump because Trump, again, didn't understand
[21:33.040 --> 21:35.880]  what's going on, and I'm not giving him a pass.
[21:35.880 --> 21:40.320]  Paul has come out and said that the vaccine cult, the leftist global UN cult, isn't going
[21:40.320 --> 21:42.040]  to be happy until they're injecting newborns.
[21:42.040 --> 21:47.360]  But yeah, with dozens of systems that erase their immune system and give them permanent
[21:47.360 --> 21:52.280]  spike protein colonies that are equivalent to what causes mad cow disease or spongiform
[21:52.280 --> 21:54.400]  and stuff, a lot of it.
[21:54.400 --> 21:55.400]  And so I love Rand Paul.
[21:55.400 --> 22:00.400]  I've known Rand Paul 28 years, knowing back when he was in college, doing interviews for
[22:00.400 --> 22:03.800]  his daddy, trying to get him reelected to Congress.
[22:03.800 --> 22:06.560]  But he's a real chink in the globalist armor.
[22:06.560 --> 22:10.160]  He's the knight out on the field with a much better, more prestigious position than I've
[22:10.160 --> 22:14.560]  got, or Joe Rogan's got, or even Tucker Carlson's got, and we need him to lead.
[22:14.560 --> 22:19.080]  Well, he's starting to do it when he says they won't be happy until they inject the
[22:19.080 --> 22:20.320]  children with this.
[22:20.320 --> 22:21.800]  He's going in the right direction.
[22:21.800 --> 22:23.040]  But it's the elephant in the room.
[22:23.040 --> 22:24.360]  It's all the medical literature.
[22:24.360 --> 22:25.720]  It's all the facts.
[22:25.720 --> 22:28.480]  We know that it doesn't protect you.
[22:28.480 --> 22:37.880]  It's not that it gets 96% or 74% or 49% or 32% or 21% or 18% or 5%.
[22:37.880 --> 22:41.960]  They've whittled it down to that with Pfizer and Moderna, quote, after six, eight months.
[22:41.960 --> 22:45.080]  Now they go, oh, you just need it because of Omnicron.
[22:45.080 --> 22:48.680]  That's why it isn't working anymore.
[22:48.680 --> 22:50.280]  Record numbers of people in hospitals.
[22:50.280 --> 22:51.800]  It wasn't the case last year.
[22:51.800 --> 22:52.800]  Now it is.
[22:52.800 --> 22:54.120]  And we didn't just predict it.
[22:54.120 --> 22:55.440]  We laid it all out.
[22:55.440 --> 22:58.360]  So finally, Senator Paul's starting to go in the right direction.
[22:58.360 --> 23:01.520]  Here it is.
[23:01.520 --> 23:10.400]  So explain to me, why is this only one size fits all medicine all the time?
[23:10.400 --> 23:13.400]  These people won't be happy until they get your newborn.
[23:13.400 --> 23:17.200]  They really want to get your newborn inoculated before they leave the hospital.
[23:17.200 --> 23:19.200]  They're going to restrict certain things.
[23:19.200 --> 23:23.680]  They're not going to dispense schooling, but they're also going to try to get them before
[23:23.680 --> 23:24.680]  they leave the hospital.
[23:24.680 --> 23:27.680]  I think it's outrageous and ignores the science.
[23:27.680 --> 23:32.120]  It's all based on this misreading of the science that says we haven't been vaccinated enough
[23:32.120 --> 23:34.400]  and that we're under vaccinated.
[23:34.400 --> 23:37.440]  The truth from the CDC is quite the opposite.
[23:37.440 --> 23:43.040]  Over age 75, 97% of people have voluntarily chosen to be vaccinated.
[23:43.040 --> 23:48.960]  Between ages 64 and 75, 99% of people have been vaccinated.
[23:48.960 --> 23:51.400]  So we are voluntarily accepting this.
[23:51.400 --> 23:53.600]  Most people at high risk have been vaccinated.
[23:53.600 --> 23:56.200]  This is a disease of the elderly, not of children.
[23:56.200 --> 23:57.840]  Okay, so that's enough.
[23:57.840 --> 24:01.480]  He's still falling back on data from a year ago because he pushed this and said, yeah,
[24:01.480 --> 24:02.480]  go ahead and take it.
[24:02.480 --> 24:03.480]  Let's reopen things.
[24:03.480 --> 24:05.960]  He was wrong, just like Trump.
[24:05.960 --> 24:08.560]  But at least he's saying they're not going to be happy until they inject your children
[24:08.560 --> 24:10.720]  and pointing out your children don't need it.
[24:10.720 --> 24:12.520]  Yes, what an incredible crime.
[24:12.520 --> 24:14.920]  No one needs it.
[24:14.920 --> 24:19.160]  They suppress the Pfizer documents that it caused thousands to die in just the first
[24:19.160 --> 24:22.400]  few months and massive increases of miscarriages.
[24:22.400 --> 24:23.880]  And you know that, Senator.
[24:23.880 --> 24:27.360]  Let's see, that's why this broadcast is different, why it's so important to keep us on air and
[24:27.360 --> 24:28.760]  why I thank you all.
[24:28.760 --> 24:32.560]  Because I don't care if you're black or white, older, young, Christian, Muslim, Jewish.
[24:32.560 --> 24:34.800]  It doesn't matter.
[24:34.800 --> 24:37.280]  If you are promoting freedom, I'm your brother.
[24:37.280 --> 24:39.600]  I'm your friend.
[24:39.600 --> 24:42.960]  But if you know the truth and you don't go all the way, I'm coming after you.
[24:42.960 --> 24:47.520]  And I'm telling you, our victory will be in making the good Republicans come out and take
[24:47.520 --> 24:49.200]  on big pharma all the way.
[24:49.200 --> 24:50.720]  They know that's dangerous.
[24:50.720 --> 24:53.080]  They know that you'll get attacked if you do that.
[24:53.080 --> 24:55.320]  They know you might get killed.
[24:55.320 --> 24:56.760]  Paul's already been shot at.
[24:56.760 --> 24:58.520]  He's already had his ribs broken, his lung punctured.
[24:58.520 --> 24:59.520]  I get it.
[24:59.520 --> 25:00.520]  I love Rand Paul.
[25:00.520 --> 25:01.520]  I know he's a good man.
[25:01.520 --> 25:03.960]  But you don't have half measures, Senator.
[25:03.960 --> 25:06.240]  We need your full announcements.
[25:06.240 --> 25:09.760]  We need you to put on the full armor of truth and take the enemy on point blank.
[25:09.760 --> 25:10.760]  I've done it.
[25:10.760 --> 25:14.800]  And I'm not trying to tell you to man up here, because I'm such a man, I'm saying I need
[25:14.800 --> 25:15.800]  you.
[25:15.800 --> 25:17.920]  We all need you.
[25:17.920 --> 25:20.520]  So man up for your own children.
[25:20.520 --> 25:23.640]  We'll be lying in your bed like they say in Braveheart many years from now, wishing just
[25:23.640 --> 25:24.640]  once, just once.
[25:24.640 --> 25:28.640]  You tell these globalists you can take our lives, but you'll never take our freedom.
[25:28.640 --> 25:33.720]  Let's play back to back Dr. Zelinko last Friday in that super viral video of him saying
[25:33.720 --> 25:36.520]  the COVID vaccine causes AIDS, which it does.
[25:36.520 --> 25:40.240]  And then we'll play a clip from Karen Kingston with Stu Peters.
[25:40.240 --> 25:44.200]  And then we back up what she's saying with one of the big pharma announcements and one
[25:44.200 --> 25:49.160]  of their own PSAs admitting that they've put the HIV spike protein in it.
[25:49.160 --> 25:50.160]  Here it is.
[25:50.160 --> 25:52.560]  There's a lot of people are going to tune in here wanting to know, hey, what's going
[25:52.560 --> 25:57.840]  on with the shot and the fact that it's all confirmed, it's hurting people.
[25:57.840 --> 25:59.680]  And where you see that going, Dr. Zelinko?
[25:59.680 --> 26:05.280]  Well, you know, I've said things and of course, then I get cold nuts and then two, three months
[26:05.280 --> 26:10.800]  later, people come to realize that what I said was correct and they take credit for
[26:10.800 --> 26:11.800]  it.
[26:11.800 --> 26:12.800]  But I don't care about that.
[26:12.800 --> 26:17.560]  But what I will say is that the spike protein, whether from the virus or from the vaccine
[26:17.560 --> 26:22.080]  causes AIDS, causes acquired immune deficiency.
[26:22.080 --> 26:23.080]  Wow.
[26:23.080 --> 26:24.080]  Elaborate on that.
[26:24.080 --> 26:25.080]  Yeah.
[26:25.080 --> 26:30.560]  It destroys your immune system, your innate immune system that damages your T cells, makes
[26:30.560 --> 26:35.280]  you much more vulnerable to, first of all, developing cancer and autoimmune diseases
[26:35.280 --> 26:36.680]  and other infections.
[26:36.680 --> 26:37.880]  And that's why people are dying.
[26:37.880 --> 26:42.960]  There is most likely not a natural solution to this, that the enemy is really, this is
[26:42.960 --> 26:43.960]  a biblical war.
[26:43.960 --> 26:47.720]  It's just, this is the end game of creation, I know.
[26:47.720 --> 26:50.840]  And we have enough, it's a glorious time to be alive.
[26:50.840 --> 26:54.720]  It's turbulent, it's definitely scary.
[26:54.720 --> 26:58.320]  There's going to be a huge body count, there already is.
[26:58.320 --> 27:04.720]  And I just hope that there'll be, you know, if this conversation leads to one person not
[27:04.720 --> 27:07.440]  dying unnecessarily, it's already considered.
[27:07.440 --> 27:08.440]  Annihilate them.
[27:08.440 --> 27:12.120]  Now, this is the part when people's jaws are going to drop.
[27:12.120 --> 27:14.960]  We know CGG is not found in nature, therefore, it's patentable.
[27:14.960 --> 27:17.720]  Well, who did all the research on this and who owns it?
[27:17.720 --> 27:23.680]  Well, Dr. Fauci did a number of studies, he paid himself over $11.667 million with U.S.
[27:23.680 --> 27:30.680]  taxpayer dollars between 2014 and 2020 to research using glycoprotein 120 from HIV and
[27:30.680 --> 27:33.120]  integrating it into coronaviruses.
[27:33.120 --> 27:36.400]  And he patented it, he owns several patents on this.
[27:36.400 --> 27:42.600]  So every time someone's being injected with a synthetic mRNA, producing the Wuhan-HU-1
[27:42.600 --> 27:45.680]  spike glycoprotein, Fauci is making a dime.
[27:45.680 --> 27:50.680]  This is someone's gone absolutely mad.
[27:50.680 --> 27:57.120]  The shape of the coronavirus spike protein before the virus meets our cells is what triggers
[27:57.120 --> 28:00.120]  the most protective antibody response.
[28:00.120 --> 28:07.000]  So, Keith must make the spike protein in the lab, knocking it into exactly the same shape
[28:07.000 --> 28:15.000]  by adding another protein that acts a bit like a clamp, and that protein is a tiny fragment
[28:15.000 --> 28:16.000]  of HIV.
[28:16.000 --> 28:23.160]  The reason we chose this protein is because it's so well understood, it's a highly stable
[28:23.160 --> 28:28.160]  structure, there is absolutely no risk from this type of vaccine, there's nothing that
[28:28.160 --> 28:30.360]  makes HIV a replicate.
[28:30.360 --> 28:34.800]  So it's got HIV replicated, it's so good for you, and of course if you go back and study
[28:34.800 --> 28:37.600]  HIV, why was it so much more deadly in Africans?
[28:37.600 --> 28:45.720]  Because it turns out that many of the cells, particularly the blood in Africans, is different
[28:45.720 --> 28:48.760]  and that the HIV spike protein can plug into it better.
[28:48.760 --> 28:53.000]  So it kills white people and Hispanics too, and Asians, but it really loves killing those
[28:53.000 --> 28:54.000]  black people.
[28:54.000 --> 29:20.000]  But remember, CNN loves black people.
[29:20.000 --> 29:38.760]  It's a really good thing.
[29:38.760 --> 29:43.680]  As a founding member, you become part of an elite circle, continuing the fight against
[29:43.680 --> 29:45.840]  the globalist new world order.
[29:45.840 --> 29:49.880]  That's why you're called a founding member, because the funding from this is going to
[29:49.880 --> 29:55.000]  go towards launching these new independent systems that will empower the American people
[29:55.000 --> 29:59.160]  to take free speech in the face of censoring tyrants to the next level.
[29:59.160 --> 30:03.680]  I never compromised the quality of ingredients we put in InfoWars Live products, and that's
[30:03.680 --> 30:08.000]  why for more than two years we've been sold out of Ultimate Bone Broth, and we could never
[30:08.000 --> 30:13.040]  get the ingredients again until now, and we have reformulated and not just used the same
[30:13.040 --> 30:16.680]  ingredients, we've boosted it and made them even stronger.
[30:16.680 --> 30:20.400]  So out of all the bone broths out there, I'm telling you, this is next level.
[30:20.400 --> 30:21.840]  Listen to what it's got in it.
[30:21.840 --> 30:26.880]  Cutting-edge chicken bone broth protein isolate powder for better flavor and dissolvability.
[30:26.880 --> 30:31.800]  It's got turmeric root, chaga mushroom, bee pollen, goji berry, alfalfa herb powder, and
[30:31.800 --> 30:36.440]  a bunch of other amazing known berries that turbocharge your body with antioxidants, and
[30:36.440 --> 30:39.800]  then it's got a bunch of other incredible things like magnesium, potassium, and sodium
[30:39.800 --> 30:40.800]  added.
[30:40.800 --> 30:45.360]  This sucker has got everything for your electrolytes, it's got real organic cocoa butter powder
[30:45.360 --> 30:49.480]  with natural chocolate flavor and a touch of sea salt, and it just goes on and on.
[30:49.480 --> 30:55.240]  It is now back in stock, Ultimate Bone Broth Plus, available at 20% off and free shipping
[30:55.240 --> 30:59.040]  out of the gates at InfoWarsStore.com.
[30:59.040 --> 31:03.840]  I've been fighting as hard as I can for almost 28 years against the globalist.
[31:03.840 --> 31:05.880]  I wanted to stop their agenda.
[31:05.880 --> 31:11.560]  I wanted to wake up the world and stop them dead in their tracks before they went operational,
[31:11.560 --> 31:12.560]  but we failed.
[31:12.560 --> 31:14.040]  Yes, a lot of people are awake.
[31:14.040 --> 31:19.800]  Yes, we're not getting caught flat footed, but they are going ahead with their full operational
[31:19.800 --> 31:24.280]  deindustrialization great reset, and that's why it's more important than ever that all
[31:24.280 --> 31:28.960]  viewers and all listeners tell everybody they know about the show because people are ready
[31:28.960 --> 31:31.080]  to wake up and ready to hear the truth.
[31:31.080 --> 31:34.320]  So we've got an information warfare of the enemy and trying to stop their agenda, and
[31:34.320 --> 31:37.760]  we've also got to get personally prepared, and one of the number one things to do is
[31:37.760 --> 31:38.960]  high quality, storeable food.
[31:38.960 --> 31:43.960]  We've got the best food ready to ship at very affordable prices at InfoWarsStore.com.
[31:43.960 --> 31:48.000]  So whether it's a month or a six month or a year supply or specialty diets, it's ready
[31:48.000 --> 31:49.480]  to ship right now.
[31:49.480 --> 31:54.360]  Lock your orders in before food prices go up and before there are long lines and waits
[31:54.360 --> 31:56.800]  because believe me, serious times are coming.
[31:56.800 --> 31:59.320]  Get ready at InfoWarsStore.com.
[31:59.320 --> 32:03.480]  So when I first started taking survival shield, basically I was 275 pounds.
[32:03.480 --> 32:04.480]  I was overweight.
[32:04.480 --> 32:06.520]  I had brain fog like you wouldn't believe.
[32:06.520 --> 32:11.080]  I was barely holding on to a job, and I heard Dr. Group on your show and I listened to it.
[32:11.080 --> 32:15.640]  So the first one I got was the original survival shield, the X1, and it worked pretty good.
[32:15.640 --> 32:19.520]  And then shortly thereafter, you came out with that, you know, with a deep burn source,
[32:19.520 --> 32:21.680]  you know, and I got really excited about that, so I took it.
[32:21.680 --> 32:28.000]  And man, in two weeks, I went from brain fog to like literally like my brain was enlightened,
[32:28.000 --> 32:29.000]  you know.
[32:29.000 --> 32:30.000]  I could think again.
[32:30.000 --> 32:31.000]  I could connect with people again.
[32:31.000 --> 32:35.680]  And over the course of the next couple of years, I got my health back and I religiously
[32:35.680 --> 32:37.800]  take basically all of your supplements.
[32:37.800 --> 32:39.680]  They're all absolutely amazing supplements.
[32:39.680 --> 32:41.840]  The one I like recently is knockout.
[32:41.840 --> 32:44.120]  It literally, like if you want to sleep, just take it.
[32:44.120 --> 32:45.120]  It's amazing.
[32:45.120 --> 32:46.120]  It works.
[32:46.120 --> 32:47.840]  But anyway, so the point is we have to get ourselves clean.
[32:47.840 --> 32:50.440]  We have to break free of the globalist system.
[32:50.440 --> 32:54.080]  And the only way to do that is to take our own health into our own hands.
[32:54.080 --> 32:55.200]  Beautifully said, brother.
[32:55.200 --> 33:05.480]  I thank you so much for calling Godspeed leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World
[33:05.480 --> 33:06.480]  Order.
[33:06.480 --> 33:19.000]  It's Alex Jones defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic.
[33:19.000 --> 33:32.840]  I don't normally give Don Lemon of CNN any attention because he's one of the most over
[33:32.840 --> 33:36.440]  the top ridiculous propagandists out there.
[33:36.440 --> 33:42.640]  But now that Cuomo's left and his producers been busted for reportedly running a child
[33:42.640 --> 33:47.400]  trafficking sex slave operation, which you know, of course, is connected to larger groups
[33:47.400 --> 33:48.400]  above him.
[33:48.400 --> 33:49.400]  It's a network.
[33:49.400 --> 33:52.960]  Lemon's one of the biggest shows there.
[33:52.960 --> 33:58.160]  He's got almost a half million viewers, which is tiny, of course, compared to even local
[33:58.160 --> 34:01.480]  radio shows in big cities have more viewers or listeners than that.
[34:01.480 --> 34:11.520]  So he's now come out and really gas lit the public even more saying car accidents are
[34:11.520 --> 34:14.600]  up in the United States because you're not wearing mask.
[34:14.600 --> 34:16.560]  And you ask that makes no sense.
[34:16.560 --> 34:18.240]  This is all gaslighting folks.
[34:18.240 --> 34:22.240]  They're training you to listen to pure bull and just get what you're not offended by it
[34:22.240 --> 34:25.280]  and where you just give up on information period.
[34:25.280 --> 34:28.000]  That's called jamming.
[34:28.000 --> 34:31.680]  And I'm going to explain the psychological warfare they're involved in right now.
[34:31.680 --> 34:35.640]  My job is to break down how the world really works, who the real players are, and then
[34:35.640 --> 34:39.760]  to give you tools that once you understand them, you'll surpass my understanding.
[34:39.760 --> 34:41.840]  Because I'm not telling you what to see.
[34:41.840 --> 34:49.240]  I'm getting you to take the blinders off or to reverse the image, put the glasses on like
[34:49.240 --> 34:50.240]  they live.
[34:50.240 --> 34:54.520]  So I'm going to play a clip of that in a moment, go through a bunch of geopolitical news,
[34:54.520 --> 35:01.360]  a bunch of out of control congressional news, a bunch of CNN pedophile ring information.
[35:01.360 --> 35:07.680]  And we are also going to be looking at the latest COVID-19 information and how people
[35:07.680 --> 35:11.680]  around the world are striking back against that separately.
[35:11.680 --> 35:17.160]  I want to thank listeners, though, for realizing that Info Wars is the tip of the spear and
[35:17.160 --> 35:24.000]  that Info Wars won't back down when it comes to exposing the globalist and their operations.
[35:24.000 --> 35:26.520]  And that really this is a historic operation.
[35:26.520 --> 35:31.200]  And so you don't just get great products when you shop at infowarstore.com, you're also really
[35:31.200 --> 35:33.600]  our funding.
[35:33.600 --> 35:37.680]  The most effective organization out there that has massively influenced not just hundreds
[35:37.680 --> 35:44.440]  of millions of people conservatively towards liberty, but some of the top people out there
[35:44.440 --> 35:46.320]  now fighting the New World Order.
[35:46.320 --> 35:48.240]  We have been instrumental in waking them up.
[35:48.240 --> 35:49.240]  They've told me personally.
[35:49.240 --> 35:50.520]  That's not about bragging.
[35:50.520 --> 35:55.400]  It's about giving you the good report card for your support and, you know, you're my
[35:55.400 --> 35:59.120]  boss and I'm saying I have tried to be a good servant of freedom.
[35:59.120 --> 36:00.240]  I've tried to be fearless.
[36:00.240 --> 36:01.480]  I've tried to work super hard.
[36:01.480 --> 36:03.040]  I've tried to really tell the truth.
[36:03.040 --> 36:08.320]  I've tried to be bold and I've just gone with the justice and the truth in my guts.
[36:08.320 --> 36:13.680]  And I really do need you now as we enter the main part of the battle to support us with
[36:13.680 --> 36:16.480]  your prayers, your word of mouth, and financially.
[36:16.480 --> 36:24.640]  Now I'm not going to BS you, UPS and USPS that we use and every other shipping system
[36:24.640 --> 36:28.120]  is behind a lot more than it was past Christmases.
[36:28.120 --> 36:32.000]  So normally anywhere in the continental United States you could order stuff three days before
[36:32.000 --> 36:33.560]  Christmas and get it.
[36:33.560 --> 36:38.080]  Five days before Christmas you could get it in Hawaii or Alaska or even earlier.
[36:38.080 --> 36:42.520]  Because of what's going on in the lower 48, you need to get your orders in by Thursday
[36:42.520 --> 36:44.480]  to get them before Christmas.
[36:44.480 --> 36:46.680]  Need to be in by Thursday.
[36:46.680 --> 36:48.600]  We'll get it all shipped out Thursday and Friday.
[36:48.600 --> 36:49.600]  We're up to date.
[36:49.600 --> 36:53.320]  We're shipping stuff within really 12 hours usually but, you know, sometimes obviously
[36:53.320 --> 36:54.320]  we count the weekend.
[36:54.320 --> 36:58.000]  It takes 24 hours because nobody works on Sunday.
[36:58.000 --> 37:01.800]  So if you want to do your Christmas shopping with us, want to support the Info War and
[37:01.800 --> 37:05.160]  Get Great Products at the same time and not fight the crowds and not support the biggest
[37:05.160 --> 37:09.560]  tabbush with box stores, then do your shopping at infowarstore.com.
[37:09.560 --> 37:13.160]  And our biggest sales of the year always are in November and December.
[37:13.160 --> 37:14.520]  We're selling out a lot of great products.
[37:14.520 --> 37:18.600]  The supply chain has broken down so bad that if you thought we've had products sold out
[37:18.600 --> 37:23.880]  for six months to a year was bad, we're looking at not going to be able to have these products
[37:23.880 --> 37:27.040]  perhaps next year with more lockdowns coming in.
[37:27.040 --> 37:31.120]  And that's some other news I wanted to add here because this isn't just a plug here.
[37:31.120 --> 37:35.280]  This is also news.
[37:35.280 --> 37:41.280]  Inside baseball in Connecticut, inside baseball in D.C. because we're embroiled in criminal
[37:41.280 --> 37:43.400]  and civil cases in both those places.
[37:43.400 --> 37:48.080]  And in Texas, they've already said in Connecticut and they've already said in D.C. they're looking
[37:48.080 --> 37:53.240]  to shut down most of the courts January 1st or so.
[37:53.240 --> 37:54.240]  And that's from judges.
[37:54.240 --> 37:55.920]  I'm going to leave it at that.
[37:55.920 --> 37:59.880]  So the net tells you where this is all going.
[37:59.880 --> 38:01.680]  This is all pre-programmed.
[38:01.680 --> 38:05.400]  The establishment up top, the technocrats tell the lower-level minions what they're going
[38:05.400 --> 38:07.520]  to be doing and so they have a heads up.
[38:07.520 --> 38:09.560]  I'm giving you a heads up on that.
[38:09.560 --> 38:11.440]  This is economic war destroyer of the country.
[38:11.440 --> 38:13.840]  So this could be Info Wars last Christmas on air.
[38:13.840 --> 38:18.400]  It could be the last Christmas you're even able to buy people presents or get supplies
[38:18.400 --> 38:19.960]  you need.
[38:19.960 --> 38:24.400]  And so it's great to buy somebody a watch or buy somebody something that's a little
[38:24.400 --> 38:25.400]  mint.
[38:25.400 --> 38:27.120]  Those are wonderful.
[38:27.120 --> 38:30.760]  But when you buy somebody vitamin mineral fusion with all the vitamins, all the minerals,
[38:30.760 --> 38:36.040]  all the key amino acids for your immune system, your body, that's the gift of life and health.
[38:36.040 --> 38:39.880]  What a great gift to get yourself some and stock up and to buy friends and family some
[38:39.880 --> 38:42.360]  for their stockings or under the tree.
[38:42.360 --> 38:46.400]  Or DNA Force Plus with the CoQ10 and the PQQ and so much more.
[38:46.400 --> 38:50.920]  The Rolls Royce for your mitochondria and your telomeres.
[38:50.920 --> 38:53.720]  Everybody should be taking that, especially during the winter and these crazy times.
[38:53.720 --> 38:58.840]  It's really next level protection as much as you're going to get through the systems
[38:58.840 --> 39:00.560]  God gave us.

[39:16.280 --> 39:21.200]  while getting the gifts you need for yourself and your loved ones at rock bottom prices.
[39:21.200 --> 39:25.440]  Instead of getting your family members the same cheap gifts, why not give them the gear,

[40:14.640 --> 40:17.880]  1776 founding member coin.
[40:17.880 --> 40:24.160]  There's less than 500 of those left that will sell out in the next few hours at infowarstore.com
[40:24.160 --> 40:26.240]  and that's really secret squirrel stuff.
[40:26.240 --> 40:30.880]  Everybody that buys that coin is going to be let in not just first but exclusively on some
[40:30.880 --> 40:32.560]  very important operations we're launching.
[40:32.560 --> 40:36.840]  So 1776 founder member, one ounce silver rounds historic coin.
[40:36.840 --> 40:37.840]  Those are about to sell out.
[40:37.840 --> 40:43.360]  Alexa Pure back in stock, Alexa Pure Pro, the great rabbit-finned water filter.
[40:43.360 --> 40:45.880]  That's $30 off.
[40:45.880 --> 40:49.960]  We've also got fan favorite products that are flying off the shelves with the pandemic
[40:49.960 --> 40:52.760]  causing massive disruptions to the supply chain.
[40:52.760 --> 40:54.720]  We just don't know when they'll be back.
[40:54.720 --> 40:58.400]  Get these products now before they're gone, vitamin mineral fusion, 40% off, these are
[40:58.400 --> 41:04.920]  selling out, prostagard, 50% off, turbo force, 40% off, all new super coral whitening toothpaste

[41:24.000 --> 41:25.000]  that today.
[41:25.000 --> 41:29.400]  I mean I might plug it again but I'm just, we need your support but it's a catch 22.
[41:29.400 --> 41:31.840]  Everything can be shut down anyways very, very soon, we won't be able to even get this
[41:31.840 --> 41:34.000]  stuff so we're getting all the money we can in.
[41:34.000 --> 41:39.240]  I sold my house, I am literally selling all this crap I bought over the years I didn't
[41:39.240 --> 41:44.560]  even need, getting lean and mean and you know getting the back 40 ready with the solar panels
[41:44.560 --> 41:48.600]  and the well and the shotgun rifle and the four wheel drive in case we lose the whole
[41:48.600 --> 41:49.600]  thing.
[41:49.600 --> 41:52.400]  I think we're gonna back the globalist off but the next 10 months they're gonna make
[41:52.400 --> 41:55.680]  a run in America and the world, the likes of which you've never seen.
[41:55.680 --> 42:00.760]  Show again, T-shirts, books, films, water filters, air filters, anything you ever wanted
[42:00.760 --> 42:07.160]  from M4 Wars, I would suggest you get it now because I'd give it, I'd give it a 50% chance,
[42:07.160 --> 42:10.560]  nobody's on the air and they got death camps operating and release real bioweapons and
[42:10.560 --> 42:12.880]  kill half the United States by the end of next year.
[42:12.880 --> 42:16.000]  I don't think they're gonna let an election happen, I think they're gonna, I'm just gonna
[42:16.000 --> 42:19.000]  be honest, I'm sorry I can't lie to you, I think the globalists are gonna go ahead and
[42:19.000 --> 42:23.400]  release bioweapons and nerve gas in the general public, so I would just get ready to, I mean
[42:23.400 --> 42:27.360]  only by saying that will we stop them, I mean this is their real plan, everything else
[42:27.360 --> 42:31.360]  was just to practice the lockdowns and practice the takeover and just get us ready for the
[42:31.360 --> 42:32.360]  real kill operation.
[42:32.360 --> 42:35.680]  They're bringing in their new old order, they've already starved an extra, now it's
[42:35.680 --> 42:40.320]  35 million people to death with lockdowns and new ones are coming, so we'll be as bad
[42:40.320 --> 42:46.440]  as Australia by next year and that's on the good side, so again, just supercharges one
[42:46.440 --> 42:50.120]  last time of it under 28 years, never talked like this but I gotta be honest with you,
[42:50.120 --> 42:54.480]  I'd say 50% chance the election doesn't happen or they have a totally staged one and we'll
[42:54.480 --> 42:59.160]  all be in death camps.
[42:59.160 --> 43:00.160]  Info.
[43:00.160 --> 43:05.080]  Alex Jones here to make a very important announcement to our amazing listeners and viewers.
[43:05.080 --> 43:13.000]  We have produced a limited run of something very, very special, it's the 1776 founder
[43:13.000 --> 43:21.440]  coin, you've gotta see this coin for yourself, it's at 1776coin.com and this coin makes you
[43:21.440 --> 43:27.680]  a founding member of a very exciting group of projects that we're gonna be launching
[43:27.680 --> 43:34.720]  in the very new future, become a founding member today, learn more at 1776coin.com or
[43:34.720 --> 43:39.160]  call toll free, triple eight, two five three, three one three nine.
[43:39.160 --> 43:44.080]  As a founding member, you become part of an elite circle, continuing the fight against
[43:44.080 --> 43:46.240]  the globalist new world order.
[43:46.240 --> 43:50.400]  That's why you're called a founding member because the funding from this is gonna go
[43:50.400 --> 43:55.680]  towards launching these new independent systems that will empower the American people to take
[43:55.680 --> 44:00.320]  free speech in the face of censoring tyrants to the next level.
[44:00.320 --> 44:07.240]  There is very little contemporary study in the world of the planet's ruling class.
[44:07.240 --> 44:12.840]  Not in communist China, not in Mexico, not in the United States, not anywhere.
[44:12.840 --> 44:16.480]  Is there a real study of the planet's ruling class?
[44:16.480 --> 44:18.200]  That's done by design.
[44:18.200 --> 44:24.240]  The large central banks that basically control the planet will penalize and target any academics
[44:24.240 --> 44:29.080]  that look in to say the Anglo-American establishment, the founder of the Bilderberg group, the Trilateral
[44:29.080 --> 44:34.240]  Commission of the United Nations, the whole project of the Rothschilds and the Rockefellers.
[44:34.240 --> 44:38.480]  Until 10 years ago, the media said the controlled corporate media of the Bilderberg group didn't
[44:38.480 --> 44:39.480]  exist.
[44:39.480 --> 44:44.480]  Well, now the Bilderberg group is public, it's former head, still on the steering committee,
[44:44.480 --> 44:48.920]  it's called Schwab and he has set up the great reset in global government.
[44:48.920 --> 44:53.760]  And if as a liberty movement worldwide, we don't address the globalist head on about
[44:53.760 --> 44:57.720]  the fact that they are worldwide authoritarian corporate takeover, we don't have a shot.
[44:57.720 --> 44:59.640]  We do expose them, we can beat them easily.
[44:59.640 --> 45:04.280]  If you think the tyranny and oppression we're living under now is bad, wait till they've
[45:04.280 --> 45:09.680]  got their world ID and that's exactly what the COVID passports are all about.
[45:09.680 --> 45:15.320]  And Klaus Schwab and the UN and all the other globalist leaders own words they admit that
[45:15.320 --> 45:20.360]  once they've gotten you with that system then they're going to carbon tax you everywhere
[45:20.360 --> 45:25.280]  you go and track what you do and publicly they're saying they're going to decide when
[45:25.280 --> 45:30.560]  you can travel and when you can't travel and mastercard and then all the other big companies
[45:30.560 --> 45:34.680]  are currently announcing they're going to track what you do and where you go and tax
[45:34.680 --> 45:37.040]  you with a carbon tax for it.
[45:37.040 --> 45:40.640]  This is the holy grail of tyranny, ladies and gentlemen.
[45:40.640 --> 45:44.160]  This is the takeover in humanity, better wake up and say no.
[45:44.160 --> 45:45.640]  Finally folks are starting to wake up.
[45:45.640 --> 45:49.280]  Joe Rogan, Tucker Carlson, others who leave the charts want with them for wars, but it's
[45:49.280 --> 45:50.280]  not enough.
[45:50.280 --> 45:55.080]  Every individual has to not comply and we have to talk about bringing the globalist to justice.
[45:55.080 --> 45:59.720]  You see they need the fear of God put in them legally and lawfully.
[45:59.720 --> 46:01.080]  Let's go ahead and take another call.
[46:01.080 --> 46:03.000]  Let's talk to Malcolm in Tennessee.
[46:03.000 --> 46:04.000]  Welcome.
[46:04.000 --> 46:05.000]  Hello, Alex.
[46:05.000 --> 46:06.000]  Yes, Malcolm.
[46:06.000 --> 46:07.000]  All right.
[46:07.000 --> 46:09.000]  I will make this quick and real short where the other patrons can get on the line.
[46:09.000 --> 46:14.000]  Alex, I have to promote one thing from one of your co-hosts, Owen Schreuer, SuperMail
[46:14.000 --> 46:16.760]  Vitality and Brain Force Plus.
[46:16.760 --> 46:17.760]  Mix those two together.
[46:17.760 --> 46:19.760]  You're an unstoppable tank.
[46:19.760 --> 46:21.320]  SuperMail Vitality really, really works.
[46:21.320 --> 46:26.280]  It's cold pressed herbs and natural compounds that have never been heated up.
[46:26.280 --> 46:31.840]  And so it has a dramatic effect compared to powdered versions that also work quite well
[46:31.840 --> 46:32.840]  but just aren't as strong.
[46:32.840 --> 46:34.840]  This is like a very fine wine.
[46:34.840 --> 46:37.240]  In fact, each batch is different.
[46:37.240 --> 46:39.240]  Sometimes it's super strong, sometimes it's just okay.
[46:39.240 --> 46:42.440]  People are like, why are you selling something and admitting sometimes the batch isn't as
[46:42.440 --> 46:43.440]  strong?
[46:43.440 --> 46:44.440]  That's just how it is.
[46:44.440 --> 46:45.440]  It's how it works.
[46:45.440 --> 46:46.880]  So it's always good.
[46:46.880 --> 46:49.040]  It's just sometimes it's like super strong.
[46:49.040 --> 47:01.240]  But yeah, if you want the Rolls Royce at a decent price, then this is it.
[47:01.240 --> 47:19.160]  Getting a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[47:19.160 --> 47:34.600]  All right, I did not plan to say what I said at the end of the last segment.
[47:34.600 --> 47:37.400]  I've been really thinking about telling you what I really think is going to happen.
[47:37.400 --> 47:42.640]  And I just, it's so horrible that I consciously don't want to say it, but my spirit wants
[47:42.640 --> 47:46.480]  to just tell you what I really think is going to happen because that's the only chance
[47:46.480 --> 47:48.700]  we've got to stop it.
[47:48.700 --> 47:51.920]  But it's not right to just come out and make these horrible announcements without really
[47:51.920 --> 47:55.760]  spending a lot of time going over it all.
[47:55.760 --> 48:03.040]  And then without telling people how to protect yourselves as best you can, if you fight back
[48:03.040 --> 48:05.760]  against the system, you're going to get marked.
[48:05.760 --> 48:08.480]  But if you don't fight back against the system, they're going to take over anyways and just
[48:08.480 --> 48:09.920]  get you later.
[48:09.920 --> 48:18.160]  And so I made the decision to just go 110% all out to go up against these people as
[48:18.160 --> 48:26.160]  hard as I can and to really just get in their face so they can draw as much attention as
[48:26.160 --> 48:30.240]  possible to what's going on and hopefully other people figure out quickly that our only
[48:30.240 --> 48:37.720]  hope is coming to grips with the fact that we're really in a dystopic depopulation takeover.
[48:37.720 --> 48:38.720]  You can see the clips.
[48:38.720 --> 48:42.000]  We can play them from 10, 12, 15 years ago where I predict exactly what was going to
[48:42.000 --> 48:47.760]  happen because, again, was not predicting any of it.
[48:47.760 --> 48:51.440]  This has been their holy grail of depopulation and control as a virus.
[48:51.440 --> 48:56.120]  And the first phases would be lockdowns to train you to live under martial law and then
[48:56.120 --> 49:00.040]  more intense, more powerful weapons releases later to get rid of you.
[49:00.040 --> 49:04.480]  And that just makes perfect sense when I was reading their battle plans, their blueprints
[49:04.480 --> 49:09.600]  that are thinly veiled, very thinly veiled.
[49:09.600 --> 49:11.760]  They tell you 98% of it.
[49:11.760 --> 49:15.960]  Hell, sometimes they admit they're doing it.
[49:15.960 --> 49:21.920]  And they admit all this.
[49:21.920 --> 49:25.440]  And so you can try to serve the system.
[49:25.440 --> 49:26.600]  You can try to go along with it.
[49:26.600 --> 49:27.840]  You can try to do whatever you want.
[49:27.840 --> 49:33.280]  But when a killer kidnaps somebody, they tie them up before they really start torturing
[49:33.280 --> 49:35.640]  them and raping them.
[49:35.640 --> 49:37.480]  And you're being tied up right now.
[49:37.480 --> 49:41.320]  You're being prepared to be locked up in your house as a prisoner forced on the virtual
[49:41.320 --> 49:46.440]  reality so that you just stay indoors while the third world is completely wiped out.
[49:46.440 --> 49:50.200]  And then the globalists are going to take their time having their way with you.
[49:50.200 --> 49:54.840]  And that's what we expose in Reset Wars at resetwars.com.
[49:54.840 --> 49:58.680]  Now live today.
[49:58.680 --> 50:01.440]  How to counter this, how to be aware of it, how to go to the next level.
[50:01.440 --> 50:06.160]  But you're going to need the psychological and spiritual strength to defeat them and
[50:06.160 --> 50:08.240]  to understand what they're doing to you.
[50:08.240 --> 50:18.680]  And that's why this is our most important work and it launches Wednesday at 11.59 a.m.
[50:18.680 --> 50:22.160]  But if you pre-order it today, you get 25% off.
[50:22.160 --> 50:24.720]  And again, I want you to watch this.
[50:24.720 --> 50:25.720]  I want you to research it.
[50:25.720 --> 50:26.800]  I want you to understand it.
[50:26.800 --> 50:29.520]  I want you to use it.
[50:29.520 --> 50:30.600]  You know I don't BS.
[50:30.600 --> 50:31.920]  You know we're game changers.
[50:31.920 --> 50:36.560]  So when I tell you something, is next level.
[50:36.560 --> 50:38.560]  This is next level.
[50:38.560 --> 50:43.160]  Okay, let's get back to Don Lemon, that I was mentioning in the last segment.
[50:43.160 --> 50:52.040]  Don Lemon, a horrible person just like Cuomo, a true nest of evil predators up there at
[50:52.040 --> 50:58.160]  CNN where producers aren't just screwing raping nine-year-old girls in front of their mothers
[50:58.160 --> 50:59.800]  who are there taking part in it.
[50:59.800 --> 51:03.560]  It's being done to train them to be a sex slave to other men because mommy wants to
[51:03.560 --> 51:05.840]  make money off the daughter.
[51:05.840 --> 51:13.720]  Mommy wants in to the CNN coolness, the funness of the Satanism, what it is, turning our children
[51:13.720 --> 51:16.080]  into a commodity, a sacrifice to MOLIC.
[51:16.080 --> 51:20.080]  That's what the whole Pagan operation is about.
[51:20.080 --> 51:27.800]  Epstein 2.0, CNN producer arrested for child rape, child grooming and preparing for trafficking.
[51:27.800 --> 51:31.960]  Cuomo's head producer.
[51:31.960 --> 51:33.460]  Look at him.
[51:33.460 --> 51:36.760]  That's the face of the enemy.
[51:36.760 --> 51:41.280]  And if I looked at that guy, I'd tell you he looks like a pedophile, doesn't he?
[51:41.280 --> 51:43.120]  Always doing a little soy boy smile.
[51:43.120 --> 51:46.560]  Let's put Brian Stelter up there.
[51:46.560 --> 51:49.160]  Not saying Brian Stelter is a pedophile, I'm just saying.
[51:49.160 --> 51:54.520]  If I was going to cast someone for a movie to play the part of someone that throws children
[51:54.520 --> 51:56.560]  to the fires of MOLIC, it'd be Brian Stelter.
[51:56.560 --> 52:05.120]  Up to him in a big priest robe with a baby, the jack-o'-lantern smile to the flame, yes.
[52:05.120 --> 52:08.480]  Bring me your children, I'm Brian Stelter.
[52:08.480 --> 52:11.520]  Let me show you my face.
[52:11.520 --> 52:17.600]  I don't make you get to chill up your spine.
[52:17.600 --> 52:21.800]  Give me the willies, won't you?
[52:21.800 --> 52:29.720]  Nobody's home but a creature that wants to destroy and it wants innocence and it always
[52:29.720 --> 52:30.720]  wants it.
[52:30.720 --> 52:33.240]  It's never stopping.
[52:33.240 --> 52:36.760]  Always attacking like a zombie, an undead.
[52:36.760 --> 52:44.120]  So, Don Lemon goes next level and says with no corollary evidence, no common sense, no
[52:44.120 --> 52:47.280]  logic that, well, it's like people don't wear masks.
[52:47.280 --> 52:48.280]  They don't care about people.
[52:48.280 --> 52:51.000]  And people that drive recklessly, they don't care about people.
[52:51.000 --> 52:55.920]  No people that don't wear masks know it's a fraud and gives you oxygen deprivation and
[52:55.920 --> 52:58.720]  bacterial pneumonia and doesn't work.
[52:58.720 --> 53:02.120]  Oh, but all the liberals, they care.
[53:02.120 --> 53:05.720]  They're the moral people so they wear the mask.
[53:05.720 --> 53:11.120]  It's the symbol that they're superior, they're good.
[53:11.120 --> 53:17.240]  So here's Don Lemon going next level with something that doesn't make sense on purpose
[53:17.240 --> 53:19.240]  just to make you tune out.
[53:19.240 --> 53:20.240]  It's jamming.
[53:20.240 --> 53:21.240]  It doesn't make sense.
[53:21.240 --> 53:22.240]  It's illogical.
[53:22.240 --> 53:24.240]  And as an adult, it just makes you tune out.
[53:24.240 --> 53:27.080]  With children, it creates mental illness.
[53:27.080 --> 53:28.080]  It creates disassociation.
[53:28.080 --> 53:30.440]  It creates multiple personalities, basically.
[53:30.440 --> 53:33.440]  Here it is.
[53:33.440 --> 53:37.800]  38,680 deaths on U.S. roads last year.
[53:37.800 --> 53:43.600]  The most fatality since 2007 and that's even with pandemic precautions drastically reducing
[53:43.600 --> 53:45.480]  the number of drivers on the road.
[53:45.480 --> 53:46.480]  So what gives?
[53:46.480 --> 53:51.040]  Well, some experts are saying that this is due to an overall lack of civility in our
[53:51.040 --> 53:55.160]  society, a lack of civility that we have seen in school board meetings.
[53:55.160 --> 53:59.480]  Okay, right here, look, right here.
[53:59.480 --> 54:05.000]  So as you can see, fists are now flying, all of this on live television.
[54:05.000 --> 54:06.000]  Fists are flying.
[54:06.000 --> 54:07.000]  Hey, pause.
[54:07.000 --> 54:09.560]  Back in five seconds.
[54:09.560 --> 54:14.360]  This is Don Lemon who, a witness says, ran up and grabbed his genitals and a bunch of
[54:14.360 --> 54:15.360]  other really sick stuff.
[54:15.360 --> 54:19.920]  I'm not going to repeat all the things that it's too gross, reportedly did.
[54:19.920 --> 54:22.520]  But we know he's raping the truth.
[54:22.520 --> 54:29.040]  And they think some people scuffling and pushing each other at a school board meeting outside
[54:29.040 --> 54:30.640]  the door is not civility.
[54:30.640 --> 54:34.080]  I thought it was mostly peaceful protest when you burned down billions of dollars of stuff
[54:34.080 --> 54:35.560]  and killed dozens of people.
[54:35.560 --> 54:39.840]  So he's murdering logic right there and then he just makes the leap into face mask.
[54:39.840 --> 54:45.320]  If you won't wear face mask, we'll see that's why there's so many wrecks and wreckle strappers.
[54:45.320 --> 54:46.320]  No.
[54:46.320 --> 54:50.400]  Claw Schwab said we're creating an angry world so people do destroy civilization.
[54:50.400 --> 54:54.560]  That's why they're cutting the police and letting criminals out of jail in 900-plus jurisdictions
[54:54.560 --> 54:59.320]  after they commit serious crimes is to make society fall, cloward and piven.
[54:59.320 --> 55:00.800]  And you're the people behind it.
[55:00.800 --> 55:04.600]  And then you sit there and talk about the uncivility when it's your plan to destroy
[55:04.600 --> 55:06.760]  civility.
[55:06.760 --> 55:08.800]  Like Mad Maxine said, continue.
[55:08.800 --> 55:13.640]  Well, some experts are saying that this is due to an overall lack of civility in our
[55:13.640 --> 55:14.640]  society.
[55:14.640 --> 55:17.920]  And this is due to the civility that we have seen in school board meetings.
[55:17.920 --> 55:22.120]  Okay, right here, look, right here.
[55:22.120 --> 55:27.640]  So as you can see, fists are now flying, all of this on live television.
[55:27.640 --> 55:30.080]  Fists are flying.
[55:30.080 --> 55:31.080]  Over mask mandates.
[55:31.080 --> 55:32.080]  We know who you are.
[55:32.080 --> 55:33.080]  Leave it come.
[55:33.080 --> 55:34.080]  No more masks.
[55:34.080 --> 55:35.080]  Leave it come.
[55:35.080 --> 55:36.080]  And we know who you are.
[55:36.080 --> 55:37.080]  By the way, hit pause.
[55:37.080 --> 55:40.280]  If you, if you're already illiterate, you can't see it.
[55:40.280 --> 55:44.520]  The fists are flying are leftist pushing people that don't want to wear a mask and then then
[55:44.520 --> 55:45.720]  barely pushing back.
[55:45.720 --> 55:46.720]  That's not fist flying.
[55:46.720 --> 55:50.720]  And it's the left initiating and as usual, but he spends it.
[55:50.720 --> 55:55.280]  And then again, people piss that they want to give oxygen deprivation that causes brain
[55:55.280 --> 55:59.680]  damage to our children and psychologically screw them up and do all these abusive things
[55:59.680 --> 56:00.680]  to them.
[56:00.680 --> 56:02.080]  And some parents are mad at school boards.
[56:02.080 --> 56:03.080]  You bet they are.
[56:03.080 --> 56:04.080]  They should be.
[56:04.080 --> 56:05.580]  You're the people pushing.
[56:05.580 --> 56:06.580]  You're the people demanding.
[56:06.580 --> 56:08.320]  You're the people letting the criminals out.
[56:08.320 --> 56:11.800]  You're the people pulling all this crap trying to start a revolution because you think you
[56:11.800 --> 56:15.840]  can win a physical one because you know intellectually everybody hates you.
[56:15.840 --> 56:16.840]  You have no ratings.
[56:16.840 --> 56:18.120]  Hollywood's collapsed.
[56:18.120 --> 56:19.200]  Your system's over.
[56:19.200 --> 56:20.680]  The Clintons are dying.
[56:20.680 --> 56:22.280]  David Rockefeller's dead.
[56:22.280 --> 56:24.040]  Let's continue.
[56:24.040 --> 56:25.040]  Over mask mandates.
[56:25.040 --> 56:27.040]  We know who you are.
[56:27.040 --> 56:28.040]  Leave it come.
[56:28.040 --> 56:29.040]  No more masks.
[56:29.040 --> 56:30.040]  Leave it come.
[56:30.040 --> 56:31.040]  And we know who you are.
[56:31.040 --> 56:33.680]  You will never be allowed in public again.
[56:33.680 --> 56:34.680]  And on airplanes.
[56:34.680 --> 56:53.400]  But with more than 229 million licensed drivers, the risks to you and your family are higher
[56:53.400 --> 56:54.400]  than ever.
[56:54.400 --> 56:58.960]  So joining me now is Pam Shadle Fisher from the Governor's Highway Safety Association.
[56:58.960 --> 57:08.760]  He goes on to say that it's the people not wearing masks are causing the incivility that's
[57:08.760 --> 57:09.760]  causing more wrecks.
[57:09.760 --> 57:10.760]  No.
[57:10.760 --> 57:12.400]  You guys have put us in a pressure cooker.
[57:12.400 --> 57:14.920]  You're trying to divide society.
[57:14.920 --> 57:19.040]  In Austin the police have been publicly ordered to do no proactive policing.
[57:19.040 --> 57:20.480]  So crime is just exploding.
[57:20.480 --> 57:25.560]  Mass shootouts every night, death, record killing in all Democrat run cities, massive crime.
[57:25.560 --> 57:28.200]  Everybody I know has had their house broken into or their cars.
[57:28.200 --> 57:33.800]  And then he sits up there trying to tell you how he is up there and how you're just not
[57:33.800 --> 57:37.680]  civil because you don't like the school boards teaching your children pedophilia and critical
[57:37.680 --> 57:38.680]  race theory.
[57:38.680 --> 57:43.600]  And you don't like them waking kids wearing masks and oh let's have the road group on
[57:43.600 --> 57:45.200]  here that wants to ban human drivers.
[57:45.200 --> 57:48.320]  We'll be back with hour number two.
[57:48.320 --> 57:52.280]  Alex Jones here to make a very.
[57:52.280 --> 57:54.280]  Get our great bag of it here.
[57:54.280 --> 57:58.560]  I mean, this is from people say, why is it from Chiapas, Mexico, the communists?
[57:58.560 --> 58:03.760]  Well, that's where some of the best coffee in the world that's wild harvested above organic
[58:03.760 --> 58:06.320]  in the volcanic soil, better than Guatemalan coffee.
[58:06.320 --> 58:09.600]  And yeah, we buy it from the little farmers that, you know, the media calls communist,
[58:09.600 --> 58:11.080]  but really they're just a commune.
[58:11.080 --> 58:14.080]  And whatever the point is, is that it's good coffee and we've got it.
[58:14.080 --> 58:16.280]  And the farmers don't let the Mexican government take over.
[58:16.280 --> 58:19.640]  So I actually buy this from the Mexican rebels and I've been buying it for what 14 years and
[58:19.640 --> 58:20.640]  the price has never gone up.
[58:20.640 --> 58:25.080]  The same stuff sold at Whole Foods under another name for about 50% more per pound.
[58:25.080 --> 58:27.560]  And I just think it's some of the best coffee you're going to find anywhere.
[58:27.560 --> 58:32.560]  It's Wake Up America, Patriot Blend from the Chiapas Rebels, literally, in fact, I'm going
[58:32.560 --> 58:36.560]  to tell you a little story.
[58:36.560 --> 58:37.560]  We had like that.
[58:37.560 --> 58:39.560]  I think you wouldn't believe it.
[58:39.560 --> 58:43.720]  Anyway, so it's infowarstore.com and that's how we fund this operation.
[58:43.720 --> 58:50.720]  And if you don't find us, you don't want us here, that's fine.
[59:13.720 --> 59:20.720]  And if you're looking for a good idea for the next 50 days to flatten the cans, I also
[59:20.720 --> 59:28.540]  need you to wear masks and I also need you to only shop at mega corporations.
[59:28.540 --> 59:35.940]  That way we can consolidate control and bankrupt the world economy, leaving companies that
[59:35.940 --> 59:39.200]  only I own profitable.
[59:39.200 --> 59:49.200]  If you get that special shot and feed him from Cobra, it will remove your immune system so you'll be dependent on me for the rest of your miserable lives.
[59:51.200 --> 59:57.200]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[59:57.200 --> 1:00:16.200]  Alright, I've got so much news and so many clips and so much to cover here today, and I'm just really thinking about what I said at the start of the last segment about their plan for world government, their plan for depopulation.
[1:00:16.200 --> 1:00:36.200]  I mean, it's here, it's being done. They are injecting children with a mRNA compound that makes your cells produce an HIV spike protein that's highly toxic, and that's why even though when you get over COVID, you're still sick for over a year and a half, and they think it may go longer.
[1:00:36.200 --> 1:00:56.200]  They've just been looking at it half. Dr. McCullough, a great job breaking that down, but this is not debatable. The hospital systems in Europe, the UK, the US, Canada now know there's a multi-thousand percent increase in myocarditis and heart attacks, and they call it vaccine-induced myocarditis.
[1:00:56.200 --> 1:01:14.200]  It's a new term, but Fauci knows you don't know that. Hell, I didn't know that till I studied the hell out of it, so they just sit up there and laugh at you, show they want global depopulation, they want global collapse, they want an organized worldwide crisis, they want war against us that they direct that we don't know is them.
[1:01:14.200 --> 1:01:29.200]  And the more you comply, the more they get away with it, so let me this. Let me come back and hit all the COVID-19 news, the good, the bad, and the ugly, and the longer segment, next segment.
[1:01:29.200 --> 1:01:48.200]  And then I'm going to talk about what next year is going to look like if we don't really take action, have a mass awakening, and if governors and legislators and senators that are good and House members don't become very vocal and really call it like it is where we're going to be.
[1:01:48.200 --> 1:02:06.200]  And I want to explain something. It makes me physically sick to tell you what's coming next. I think you already know as well to actually put all the pieces together in my mind is extremely upsetting, and I understand why you don't want to believe this.
[1:02:06.200 --> 1:02:22.200]  I don't want to either. And I feel like I'm about to get my arm broken next segment, even covering this. Because when I start telling you the details of it and what it's going to look like and how they're going to do it, and I start imaging all these dead children in my mind that's already happening.
[1:02:23.200 --> 1:02:27.200]  I'm not being dramatic. I don't even know if I can do it. I can't believe this.
[1:02:27.200 --> 1:02:37.200]  Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. And I'm not taking the Lord's name in vain. I'm saying God, please help me.
[1:02:40.200 --> 1:02:49.200]  You know, I'm going to do it. But I might have to air a couple clips next segment. Take a break because to come on here and say all this.
[1:02:49.200 --> 1:02:59.200]  Because all I do is tell you what I really think is going to happen. To speak it. Well, even my wife asked me what's coming next. I don't want to tell her.
[1:03:01.200 --> 1:03:12.200]  To say it on air really makes me angry. And it also makes me angry at myself because my body wants me to go stop these people.
[1:03:12.200 --> 1:03:19.200]  And it's saying you're a bad person because you're not attacking them. But they want us to do that because they're losing.
[1:03:19.200 --> 1:03:28.200]  So there's a needle. We got a thread here. And I just want the people serving the system to know you're all you're going to be dead.
[1:03:29.200 --> 1:03:36.200]  I mean, this thing ends by 2030 on according to their blueprint. And I thought they were behind schedule a few years ago, but they went ahead and accelerated it.
[1:03:36.200 --> 1:03:46.200]  And they say 80 to 90 percent of the public will be dead by 2030. That's only eight years out, folks.
[1:03:46.200 --> 1:03:55.200]  So please listen to me. Please listen to me. All of you out there. I don't care what color you are, whether you're for the government or corporation.
[1:03:55.200 --> 1:04:03.200]  You're all the same. You're under this attack. And you can pretend this isn't true. I understand it's hard to believe, but it is true.
[1:04:03.200 --> 1:04:12.200]  And it's very hard for me to actually stay on air and not just be running to the most remote middle of nowhere shack behind a mountain.
[1:04:12.200 --> 1:04:23.200]  And I mean, I'm almost going to go convince my family or by just a leaf. I mean, it's hard for me to stay at my post here as an American citizen and warn people because this is so horrible.
[1:04:23.200 --> 1:04:30.200]  But I see people demonstrating and protesting around the world and I see people standing up at governors and police departments standing up and it's very, very positive.
[1:04:30.200 --> 1:04:39.200]  But they're only standing up to a limited level in what they're saying. You've got to point out it's on purpose. It's a criminal takeover. It's mass murder. They're the enemy.
[1:04:39.200 --> 1:04:45.200]  And the enemy is a very small scientific so-called elite who really aren't elite at all. They're just scum.
[1:04:45.200 --> 1:04:49.200]  So I'm going to try to cover it when we come back. Stay with us.
[1:04:49.200 --> 1:05:04.200]  Alex Jones here with a very important, Alex Jones here with a very important announcement to all of our listeners, viewers and supporters.
[1:05:04.200 --> 1:05:18.200]  We are attempting to develop and deploy systems that allow the American people, not just info wars, to get around corporate sensors and get the truth out about the New World Order's agenda so we can stop it dead in its tracks.
[1:05:18.200 --> 1:05:31.200]  And so, when you visit 1776coin.com, you don't just have the opportunity to get an amazing one run limited edition silver coin minted right here in America with incredible historical artwork on it.
[1:05:31.200 --> 1:05:40.200]  You will also be funding a very serious focused information warfare operation against the New World Order.
[1:05:40.200 --> 1:05:48.200]  So I want to thank you all for your past support and I want to encourage you now to not wait and to not procrastinate and to go to 1776coin.com.
[1:05:48.200 --> 1:06:12.200]  I would imagine that we will sell out of this limited run of 10,000 coins in only a few weeks, maybe a few days. So secure your coin now at 1776coin.com.
[1:06:18.200 --> 1:06:23.200]  All right, I want to explain something to you.
[1:06:23.200 --> 1:06:40.200]  You could get four or five college degrees to understand this information, understand how every piece of it is corporately run, how all the programs interlock together, and a lot of you know as much as I do or even more, especially from the fields you've worked in.
[1:06:40.200 --> 1:06:52.200]  But when I get a chance to talk to somebody like General Flynn, who was a three star general and ran the US military intelligence agency, we can finish each other's sentences because he reads like I do constantly and knows how these systems integrate.
[1:06:52.200 --> 1:07:01.200]  So it's very refreshing to talk to somebody like him because he understands when I'm rattling off stuff, I'm not just saying stuff to sound smart.
[1:07:01.200 --> 1:07:12.200]  I was meeting this weekend with very, very prominent individual and they see a lot of what's going on and they were guessing what was going on. They're not regular listeners.
[1:07:12.200 --> 1:07:19.200]  But they already knew what was going on without knowing the names of the groups and the organizations and I was showing them some of it and they were blown away.
[1:07:19.200 --> 1:07:31.200]  So smart people who've been in government and high levels of things, even if they've not been fully focused on this or even partially, they can get up to speed very, very quick.
[1:07:31.200 --> 1:07:43.200]  Now, the reason I say that is when you get like a Senator Rand Paul, who I see as an ideal person to take down the deep state, that's why they try to kill him a couple times.
[1:07:43.200 --> 1:07:50.200]  But they want to make it look like a low level person did it. Crazy. Both times. Well, three times now.
[1:07:50.200 --> 1:08:01.200]  Paul has to know they're going to kill him when they drop the boom in the next year. In fact, if I was Rand Paul, I'd be getting right with Jesus right now and he's not stupid either.
[1:08:01.200 --> 1:08:17.200]  He sees the tea leaves. And if he thinks that he's going to just halfway fight the New World Order and that they're going to back off a little bit, they know his potential as being way better than Trump, smarter than Trump,
[1:08:17.200 --> 1:08:25.200]  more intellectual and less power driven. They're not going to let Rand Paul be walking around very long.
[1:08:25.200 --> 1:08:33.200]  So Rand Paul needs to join him and run up the white flag, which I know he won't do, or he needs to come out against him full bore.
[1:08:33.200 --> 1:08:42.200]  And I keep harping on Rand Paul because I can see the space time continuum as you all can, the more you try to focus on it.
[1:08:42.200 --> 1:08:49.200]  And I can guarantee you that he's in grave danger. They're not just shooting at him at the baseball games and shooting Scalise.
[1:08:49.200 --> 1:08:57.200]  He was the main target. They're not just breaking his ribs and puncturing his lungs in his house. They're not just trying to kill him on the streets of D.C.
[1:08:57.200 --> 1:09:05.200]  They know his potential, so he needs to throw the towel in, or he needs to absolutely come out against him.
[1:09:05.200 --> 1:09:13.200]  Now, General Flynn knows exactly what's going on. I know exactly what's going on.
[1:09:13.200 --> 1:09:19.200]  Tucker Carlson knows exactly what's going on. He's up to speed. Joe Rogans basically got there in the last week.
[1:09:19.200 --> 1:09:22.200]  He just can't believe it's all on purpose, but now he knows it is.
[1:09:22.200 --> 1:09:27.200]  And I'm not up here like the granddaddy telling everybody what they should do and what they shouldn't do.
[1:09:27.200 --> 1:09:35.200]  I'm just telling you, I'm like the probe that got shot into this thing first, and I've already been in it and basically gone through it.
[1:09:35.200 --> 1:09:45.200]  I'm already taking a turn and coming back around for another pass, and I'll probably get blown up on this pass to use a military analogy, but that's okay.
[1:09:45.200 --> 1:09:52.200]  We're going in. And I'm just telling everybody that you don't go up against something like this with half measures.
[1:09:52.200 --> 1:09:59.200]  You don't go into something like this playing politics.
[1:09:59.200 --> 1:10:06.200]  And you know what I'm going to say here on air is the most important thing I've said in my life. And I just, I'm not choking right now.
[1:10:06.200 --> 1:10:15.200]  I just, to tell you what life's going to be like in the next 10 months and to really lay it out, and there's so many pieces of evidence.
[1:10:15.200 --> 1:10:28.200]  There's so many parts to it that I don't feel worthy, like they say in Wayne's World, to even bring you this information.
[1:10:28.200 --> 1:10:34.200]  But let me just put it to you this way, that I'm going to try to break it down.
[1:10:34.200 --> 1:10:41.200]  It's just like walking in and telling somebody that they've got terminal cancer.
[1:10:41.200 --> 1:10:49.200]  But it's worse than that. It's like your ship's going down in the North Atlantic, the Titanic example, and there's only half as many lifeboats as you need.
[1:10:49.200 --> 1:10:52.200]  And we're going to have to decide who gets on the lifeboats.
[1:10:52.200 --> 1:10:56.200]  And if we don't start getting on the lifeboats, nobody gets on them.
[1:10:56.200 --> 1:11:00.200]  The ship goes down with the lifeboat still on, the main craft.
[1:11:00.200 --> 1:11:03.200]  And that's the best analogy I've got. I'm ready to go down with the ship.
[1:11:03.200 --> 1:11:07.200]  I just, it's genetic. I can't help it. I've got to do this. I've got to take these people on.
[1:11:07.200 --> 1:11:12.200]  But I'm sitting here watching the ship go under with everybody still on it.
[1:11:12.200 --> 1:11:25.200]  And this is really pissing me off when people like Donald Trump and Rand Paul and others have got what it takes to turn this around.
[1:11:25.200 --> 1:11:36.200]  So let me, let me just explain it this way.
[1:11:36.200 --> 1:11:41.200]  The globalists are triggering a collapse. They've got the financial collapse ready.
[1:11:41.200 --> 1:11:43.200]  They've got the cyber attack ready.
[1:11:43.200 --> 1:11:51.200]  That once that hits, you want to be able to hear from Rand Paul because all the communications will be off except for one global UN hardwired satellite.
[1:11:51.200 --> 1:11:58.200]  And no, that's not just the plot of Wonder Woman 1984. That's what they've really got set up.
[1:11:58.200 --> 1:12:08.200]  And they've been programming your subconscious to basically get, get you ready for that and accept that you only get one channel.
[1:12:08.200 --> 1:12:14.200]  And so just as I told you six months out from the election, they'll steal the election from Trump with mail-in ballots.
[1:12:14.200 --> 1:12:17.200]  They'll say he won that night, but he'll lose a few days later.
[1:12:17.200 --> 1:12:22.200]  And then they're going to take him off Twitter, Instagram, Facebook. It didn't take rocket science to know that.
[1:12:22.200 --> 1:12:30.200]  So I want people to understand when I, when I tell you this stuff, it's not like I'm just imagining this or I'm dead reckoning.
[1:12:30.200 --> 1:12:40.200]  I have millions of pieces of information that I'm able to integrate together into a clear picture like a composite eye.
[1:12:40.200 --> 1:12:51.200]  And I know what they're going to do next. And I, and I know it. It's, it's not like I just think it and only admitting how much trouble we're in.
[1:12:51.200 --> 1:13:01.200]  Do we have any hope in getting out of this? And that's basically what I'm saying. And here, here's, here's how we win.
[1:13:01.200 --> 1:13:14.200]  They're stealing the election from Trump. They're engaging in the mass censorship and the preparation for the real total takeover is just one layer of this.
[1:13:14.200 --> 1:13:26.200]  If they take us out, if they shut us down, if they go to full martial law next year, which they intend to do questions, can we stop them?
[1:13:26.200 --> 1:13:36.200]  Then what happens after that once we're inside the martial law? Because we don't give up then. In fact, it's going to get easier to finally beat them once we go into this.
[1:13:36.200 --> 1:13:47.200]  It's just going to be hell. And obviously people like myself aren't going to be allowed to be walking around seeing daylight or probably ever seeing sunlight because I'll be pushing daisies if they have their way.
[1:13:47.200 --> 1:13:52.200]  So all the other cowards have signed on to this and decided to go along with it.
[1:13:52.200 --> 1:14:04.200]  And I'm just asking everybody out there, do you want to be with these timid souls? Or do you want to stand with all the great men and women of history that were honorable or connected to God?
[1:14:04.200 --> 1:14:12.200]  If you want to crouch down and kiss the hand that feeds you, that's where you're going. That's what you want. That's who you are.
[1:14:12.200 --> 1:14:33.200]  But you're slated for destruction as well, so you don't just give up your honor. You also give up your strength and become a complete slave of people that are beyond evil, that are systematically committed destruction of the human species.
[1:14:33.200 --> 1:14:45.200]  So I've analyzed the entire attack. I've analyzed the entire takeover. We've told you exactly what would happen basically to the month, to the week of how they would roll out certain pieces of it.
[1:14:45.200 --> 1:14:52.200]  Because you can see it as plain as the nose on somebody's face. And we have documents that fill in 98% of the mosaic.
[1:14:52.200 --> 1:15:05.200]  And that's why I know in the next 10 months, the next 330 days, that this is the countdown to not just the end of the Republic, but the end of the world as we know it and billions to be exterminated.
[1:15:05.200 --> 1:15:12.200]  And just a new dark age that is going to be more horrific than any science fiction movie you ever imagined.
[1:15:12.200 --> 1:15:27.200]  And to watch a once great free people being domesticated and enslaved and destroyed and trained to accept crime and pedophilia and all this evil, this is just the beginning.
[1:15:27.200 --> 1:15:38.200]  And so I'm here to tell you, your only hope is to wake up. Your only hope is when everybody you know, your only hope is to admit this is happening and to pray for God to use you as a vessel to resist it and stop it.
[1:15:38.200 --> 1:15:44.200]  So when we come back, I'm going to do it. I'm going to tell you what they're going to do, how it's going to unfold and what it's going to look like if we don't take action.
[1:15:44.200 --> 1:15:52.200]  And then I'm going to tell you how to stop them in my view. All right. And we're just going to start every day talking about how to stop them. That's our main mission.
[1:15:52.200 --> 1:15:58.200]  We're going all the way here, 110%.
[1:15:58.200 --> 1:16:17.200]  Alex Jones here with a very important announcement to all of our listeners, viewers and supporters. We are attempting to develop and deploy systems that allow the American people, not just info wars to get around corporate censor and get the truth out about the New World Order's agenda so we can stop it dead in its tracks.

[1:17:11.200 --> 1:17:23.200]  You see, I have the survival instinct that is to get the hell out of Democrat run cities, get the hell out of major metropolitan areas, because unless we change course soon, it's all crashing down.
[1:17:23.200 --> 1:17:31.200]  Is it time to just move out to the woods, just time to go get a piece of property in the woods, just get off grid, just get the emergency food supplies, just live off the land?
[1:17:31.200 --> 1:17:38.200]  That's the survival instinct. But see the worldly part of me that's still probably the majority part of me says no, no, no, no, no, stay in the city.
[1:17:38.200 --> 1:17:43.200]  The survival instinct says get the hell out of anywhere there ever notion that you need to get a vaccine or a mask.
[1:17:43.200 --> 1:17:49.200]  That's the internal struggle that my guess is a lot of you in the audience are facing as well.
[1:17:49.200 --> 1:17:56.200]  But you can at least have some comfort if you have the emergency food supplies. And so we have the best ones at InfowarsStore.com.
[1:17:56.200 --> 1:18:09.200]  I never compromise the quality of ingredients we put in InfowarsLive products. And that's why for more than two years we've been sold out of Ultimate Bone Broth. And we could never get the ingredients again until now.
[1:18:09.200 --> 1:18:15.200]  And we have reformulated and not just used the same ingredients, we've boosted it and made them even stronger.

[1:19:18.200 --> 1:19:25.200]  Next year to expand their shield process where they come and take, quote, healthy people away and put them in facilities for their safety.
[1:19:25.200 --> 1:19:31.200]  This is nothing less than martial law. And one big thing you can do to fight back is to get high quality Faraday cages,
[1:19:31.200 --> 1:19:38.200]  many of which are made here in America and are very compliant, meaning U.S. government military grade at infowarstore.com.

[1:20:20.200 --> 1:20:35.200]  All right. Look, I know a lot of new people are tuning in every millisecond. Thank you for joining us here on the Alex Shown Show on this December 13th Monday broadcast.
[1:20:35.200 --> 1:20:47.200]  But here's what I'm getting at. We have a worldwide corporate takeover through the U.N. and through crisis management using the threat of COVID created by Bill Gates
[1:20:47.200 --> 1:20:55.200]  and the U.N. and Fauci and Peter Dazik all on record. That's all come out. People leaked all the info because they're so concerned in the inside.
[1:20:55.200 --> 1:21:00.200]  Most people actually in the government and then these corporations are actually not bad. They're pretty freaked out.
[1:21:00.200 --> 1:21:09.200]  We've seen the majority of top scientists and virologists come out and say this is a takeover and say it's depopulation and say it's evil.
[1:21:09.200 --> 1:21:18.200]  Dr. Edons, the former head of Pfizer, chief scientist, head of their science division, saying this is depopulation a year and a half ago.
[1:21:18.200 --> 1:21:24.200]  He could look at what was in the so-called vaccine. Inflation is designed to destroy you. Open borders is designed to destroy you.
[1:21:24.200 --> 1:21:34.200]  All the pedophilia, all the corruption, this is an evil takeover. This is a modern form of warfare that is against the psyche and the soul itself.
[1:21:34.200 --> 1:21:44.200]  That's always been part of warfare, but it's here now. And so we know, not just my predictions from 22 months ago, but we know now from Australia, from New Zealand,
[1:21:44.200 --> 1:21:52.200]  from Canada, from the U.K., from Spain, from Germany, some of the worst countries in the EU that forced an oculation start in a month and a half.
[1:21:52.200 --> 1:22:01.200]  Door to door, open the door and open the door. They bust in, inject you. And now they're saying seven shots a year.
[1:22:01.200 --> 1:22:06.200]  And on record, three shots completely erases your immune system, turns off your white blood cells.
[1:22:06.200 --> 1:22:20.200]  I mean, this is HIV-level stuff. And they're just doing it. And it's the full horror of this that allows them to get away with it because the average person shifts into Stockholm syndrome.
[1:22:20.200 --> 1:22:30.200]  It's incredible to think that most people, when somebody walks into their house with a knife or a gun, start crying and begging and get on their knees instead of fighting back.
[1:22:30.200 --> 1:22:40.200]  But that's the trained domestication. But this is beyond that. People are groveling some people, I'd say half the public, to the very abusers.
[1:22:40.200 --> 1:22:48.200]  And no matter how big the lie, no matter how many times the story changes, they are now under that learned helplessness.
[1:22:48.200 --> 1:23:03.200]  And so, if you look at the collapse line, if you look at the political situation, using the unelected European Union that got through as a treaty with the nations that they signed in 1956, the Treaty of Rome,
[1:23:03.200 --> 1:23:12.200]  they have an unelected dictatorship envisioned by Hitler, now in place over 30 nations in the European Union.
[1:23:12.200 --> 1:23:20.200]  And it's now expanding, it's now starting wars, it's now training its public to not worry about what we do war-wise, or not worry about what we do with the currencies,
[1:23:20.200 --> 1:23:26.200]  and not worry about us making them a tracker phone to buy or sell, or you can't go to the grocery store if you don't take your fourth shot.
[1:23:26.200 --> 1:23:35.200]  That's the new announcement in Germany today. Israel looks up at the fifth shot that they're now announcing because it makes the third sound less bad if they're the fourth or fifth.
[1:23:35.200 --> 1:23:45.200]  See, it's all psychological. They're moving towards the big event, the cyber attack that they use as the pretext to zero out the money of the world,
[1:23:45.200 --> 1:23:50.200]  bringing the new global currency that you won't be allowed to buy or sell unless you have it.
[1:23:50.200 --> 1:23:55.200]  And that's the words of the IMF, of the World Bank, of the UN, of the Nabos Group.
[1:23:55.200 --> 1:24:03.200]  I mean, they've got TV ads running for years, saying, soon you'll have no currency, there'll be a new global currency, you'll own nothing, you'll have nothing.
[1:24:03.200 --> 1:24:09.200]  Now they've issued the parameters, they've issued the apps, it's all being rolled out.
[1:24:09.200 --> 1:24:13.200]  And so all the planets are politically aligned.
[1:24:13.200 --> 1:24:25.200]  The whole system is coming together with the surveillance grid, the AI takeover, the shutdown of the farms, the shutdown of the infrastructure, the shutdown of travel,
[1:24:25.200 --> 1:24:39.200]  the military purge the people that ask questions, the nurses purged from people that ask questions, and they're going to make their move on the entire planet in the Chinese year of the tiger.
[1:24:39.200 --> 1:24:42.200]  2022.
[1:24:42.200 --> 1:24:48.200]  And I'm going to release information on why the Chinese thinks that's the year for them to make their move and so much more.
[1:24:48.200 --> 1:24:54.200]  But because the Chinese are very superstitious about that, even the communists that run it.
[1:24:54.200 --> 1:25:00.200]  And so next year, ladies and gentlemen, is when they're going to make their move.
[1:25:00.200 --> 1:25:04.200]  Next year is when the globalists are going to unleash everything they've got.
[1:25:04.200 --> 1:25:08.200]  Everything else has been building up and preparatory and getting ready for this moment.
[1:25:08.200 --> 1:25:18.200]  All the insanity, all the open borders, all the pedophilia, all the devaluations of currency and inflation, all of the weather weapons, all of the fires being set by leftists,
[1:25:18.200 --> 1:25:26.200]  the Western world, bring down society, bring down culture, an angrier world, so the people turn against their nation states, burn down their capitals,
[1:25:26.200 --> 1:25:37.200]  collapse civilization, and then the UN and the big banks come in with a global Marshall plan built back better to rebuild the planet after the collapse.
[1:25:37.200 --> 1:25:42.200]  They're going to blame on the virus and on race warfare they triggered.
[1:25:42.200 --> 1:25:49.200]  And that's why in the next 330 days we've got to work harder than the devil.
[1:25:49.200 --> 1:25:54.200]  There's old saying, working hard is the devil. We've got to work harder than these devils.
[1:25:54.200 --> 1:25:59.200]  And I'm committed to do that. I need your prayers and that gives me the strength, literally. I feel them. Thank you.
[1:25:59.200 --> 1:26:02.200]  I feel your will and your love. Thank you so much.
[1:26:02.200 --> 1:26:06.200]  But we don't really have 330 days.
[1:26:06.200 --> 1:26:13.200]  Within a month or less, hard to believe, actually, early January, actually, this is all going to start.
[1:26:13.200 --> 1:26:18.200]  And like dominoes, they just go over. And so let's talk about some of that.
[1:26:18.200 --> 1:26:22.200]  They're going to start announcing new lockdowns, but they won't call them lockdowns.
[1:26:22.200 --> 1:26:27.200]  They're going to announce more force masking. They're going to announce you the third or fourth shot.
[1:26:27.200 --> 1:26:31.200]  They're going to hype up a few police shootings that are going to go wrong.
[1:26:31.200 --> 1:26:36.200]  Statistically, they know they are and trigger more burning cities, more fires.
[1:26:36.200 --> 1:26:41.200]  They're going to massively accelerate inflation.
[1:26:41.200 --> 1:26:45.200]  They are going to continue to divide people along so many other lines.
[1:26:45.200 --> 1:26:51.200]  They're going to have a new lockdown that's already begun in the third world causing mass starvation
[1:26:51.200 --> 1:26:54.200]  that will cause giant invader waves.
[1:26:54.200 --> 1:26:58.200]  And I'm not even against the people that are fleeing this tyranny, but they are globalist weapons.
[1:26:58.200 --> 1:27:04.200]  They're being used. They've been flushed out to overwhelm and swamp our lifeboats politically
[1:27:04.200 --> 1:27:08.200]  and collapse the society so you'll have not a million people every month coming across.
[1:27:08.200 --> 1:27:14.200]  That's what it really is because they're turning loose, 8 to 10 for every person they catch.
[1:27:14.200 --> 1:27:17.200]  They already caught 2 million this year plus. That's a conservative number.
[1:27:17.200 --> 1:27:20.200]  So what's 8 times that? Well, we're talking 16 million.
[1:27:20.200 --> 1:27:23.200]  Well more than a million a month.
[1:27:23.200 --> 1:27:28.200]  So as the third world is starting to collapse, that will be the cover
[1:27:28.200 --> 1:27:32.200]  for the UN taking control of the borders and the United States.
[1:27:32.200 --> 1:27:35.200]  Then the cyber attack hits.
[1:27:35.200 --> 1:27:41.200]  Probably right before the midterm election, I would say in October.
[1:27:41.200 --> 1:27:46.200]  And again, it doesn't mean this will exactly happen, but they've got all these buttons they can push.
[1:27:46.200 --> 1:27:48.200]  They've got cards they can play. They've got the control panels.
[1:27:48.200 --> 1:27:53.200]  Well, do we lease a new virus? Do we start a war with Russia or China?
[1:27:53.200 --> 1:27:56.200]  Do we pull the lever here and cause a cyber attack?
[1:27:56.200 --> 1:28:01.200]  And I've noticed that whatever they're going to do, they've already pre-programmed and hyped.
[1:28:01.200 --> 1:28:04.200]  And then once they're about to do it, they tell you everywhere it's about to happen
[1:28:04.200 --> 1:28:06.200]  so they can be called geniuses later.
[1:28:06.200 --> 1:28:11.200]  And so they can get all their minions who are in on it ready by publicly saying,
[1:28:11.200 --> 1:28:15.200]  this is the scenario. This is what's about to happen. You understand?
[1:28:15.200 --> 1:28:20.200]  And so we're going to come back and get more into this about what it'll look like inside of this
[1:28:20.200 --> 1:28:23.200]  if we're unable to stop them and then how to stop them.
[1:28:23.200 --> 1:28:31.200]  But I don't care if you are gay or straight or old or young or black or white or brown or pink or purple or polka-dotted.
[1:28:31.200 --> 1:28:35.200]  You're going to hate the New World Order if you're even lucky enough to live.
[1:28:35.200 --> 1:28:37.200]  Maybe you'll be lucky enough to die.
[1:28:37.200 --> 1:28:39.200]  You're not going to want this.
[1:28:39.200 --> 1:28:44.200]  And the globalists are all running off to armored fortresses in the middle of nowhere right now,
[1:28:44.200 --> 1:28:47.200]  which also tells you they're moving up towards this moment.
[1:28:47.200 --> 1:28:51.200]  And then it's going to trigger big wars that are real, not just staged.
[1:28:51.200 --> 1:28:54.200]  All right, this is a cascade of collapsing events we're going to talk about.
[1:28:54.200 --> 1:29:17.200]  Straight ahead, stay with us.
[1:29:24.200 --> 1:29:26.200]  We're going to be launching in the very new future.

[1:29:36.200 --> 1:29:40.200]  As a founding member, you become part of an elite circle,
[1:29:40.200 --> 1:29:43.200]  continuing the fight against the globalist New World Order.
[1:29:43.200 --> 1:29:46.200]  That's why you're called a founding member,
[1:29:46.200 --> 1:29:50.200]  because the funding from this is going to go towards launching these new,
[1:29:50.200 --> 1:29:54.200]  independent systems that will empower the American people to take free speech
[1:29:54.200 --> 1:29:57.200]  in the face of censoring tyrants to the next level.
[1:29:57.200 --> 1:30:01.200]  Get our great bag of it here.
[1:30:01.200 --> 1:30:03.200]  I mean, this is from, people say,
[1:30:03.200 --> 1:30:06.200]  why is it from Chiapas, Mexico, the communists?
[1:30:06.200 --> 1:30:09.200]  Well, that's where some of the best coffee in the world that's wild,
[1:30:09.200 --> 1:30:12.200]  harvested above organic in the volcanic soil,
[1:30:12.200 --> 1:30:14.200]  better than Guatemalan coffee.
[1:30:14.200 --> 1:30:16.200]  And yeah, we buy it from the little farmers that, you know,
[1:30:16.200 --> 1:30:18.200]  the media calls communists, but really they're just a commune.
[1:30:18.200 --> 1:30:21.200]  And whatever the point is, is that it's good coffee, and we've got it.
[1:30:21.200 --> 1:30:23.200]  And the farmers don't let the Mexican government take over.
[1:30:23.200 --> 1:30:25.200]  So I actually buy this from the Mexican rebels,
[1:30:25.200 --> 1:30:28.200]  and I've been buying it for, what, 14 years, and the price has never gone up.
[1:30:28.200 --> 1:30:30.200]  The same stuff's sold at Whole Foods under another name,
[1:30:30.200 --> 1:30:32.200]  for about 50% more, for a pound,
[1:30:32.200 --> 1:30:35.200]  and I just think it's some of the best coffee you're going to find anywhere.
[1:30:35.200 --> 1:30:39.200]  It's Wake Up America, Patriot Blend from the Chiapas rebels, literally.
[1:30:39.200 --> 1:30:44.200]  In fact, I'm not going to tell you a little story.
[1:30:44.200 --> 1:30:45.200]  Yeah, I'd like to.
[1:30:45.200 --> 1:30:46.200]  You wouldn't believe it.
[1:30:46.200 --> 1:30:49.200]  Anyway, so it's infowarstore.com,
[1:30:49.200 --> 1:30:51.200]  and that's how we fund this operation.
[1:30:51.200 --> 1:31:17.200]  If you want to meet out, find us. If you don't want to see, that's fine.
[1:31:17.200 --> 1:31:43.200]  If you don't want to see, that's fine.
[1:31:43.200 --> 1:32:12.200]  If you don't want to see, that's fine.
[1:32:12.200 --> 1:32:38.200]  If you don't want to see, that's fine.
[1:32:38.200 --> 1:33:07.200]  If you don't want to see, that's fine.
[1:33:08.200 --> 1:33:37.200]  If you don't want to see, that's fine.
[1:33:37.200 --> 1:33:41.200]  You are the stereo system.
[1:33:41.200 --> 1:33:44.200]  But you're more than that. Your information, your research,
[1:33:44.200 --> 1:33:47.200]  you are what's also being played by the stereo system.
[1:33:47.200 --> 1:33:50.200]  Info Wars is you. You did this,
[1:33:50.200 --> 1:33:54.200]  and I want you to remember that and let that sink in.
[1:33:54.200 --> 1:33:57.200]  All right, let me get into some nuts and bolts of this.
[1:33:57.200 --> 1:34:02.200]  Here's the most important thing about where we are and what's coming.
[1:34:02.200 --> 1:34:05.200]  This is a permanent emergency they've created,
[1:34:05.200 --> 1:34:11.200]  out of which they depopulated at least 90% of the world's population.
[1:34:11.200 --> 1:34:15.200]  And we're now not theoretically talking about this like we were 25 years ago.
[1:34:15.200 --> 1:34:19.200]  We're here, where we see what they do in the countries that comply
[1:34:19.200 --> 1:34:21.200]  with the IMF and World Bank control.
[1:34:21.200 --> 1:34:24.200]  They literally starve people to death and collapse civilization.
[1:34:24.200 --> 1:34:28.200]  And most women and children stay in their huts or stay in their little apartments
[1:34:28.200 --> 1:34:32.200]  in Latin America and in Africa, and they die.
[1:34:32.200 --> 1:34:37.200]  In Venezuela, pre-fake pandemic, 2,000 people were starving to death a day.
[1:34:37.200 --> 1:34:40.200]  They passed a law eight years ago, if you were to look it up,
[1:34:40.200 --> 1:34:43.200]  not allowing you in Venezuela to call it starvation,
[1:34:43.200 --> 1:34:45.200]  but the people starved to death.
[1:34:45.200 --> 1:34:48.200]  It's 4,000 now.
[1:34:48.200 --> 1:34:50.200]  A week dying.
[1:34:50.200 --> 1:34:52.200]  Last time I saw the numbers.
[1:34:52.200 --> 1:34:58.200]  And that's a good country to be in compared to places in Africa
[1:34:58.200 --> 1:35:01.200]  and places in some areas of Asia, the Middle East.
[1:35:01.200 --> 1:35:05.200]  So this is an end of day situation,
[1:35:05.200 --> 1:35:09.200]  and billions of people are on the verge of starvation.
[1:35:09.200 --> 1:35:11.200]  It wasn't even a billion two years ago.
[1:35:11.200 --> 1:35:14.200]  Now it's billions the UN themselves have met.
[1:35:14.200 --> 1:35:17.200]  And that's what's frustrating is they order the lockdown,
[1:35:17.200 --> 1:35:19.200]  they run the program, and then they go,
[1:35:19.200 --> 1:35:21.200]  oh my gosh, give us billions of dollars.
[1:35:21.200 --> 1:35:23.200]  Oh, Elon Musk, give us $6 billion.
[1:35:23.200 --> 1:35:26.200]  We could feed people for six months and they won't die.
[1:35:26.200 --> 1:35:28.200]  You'll save hundreds of millions of people.
[1:35:28.200 --> 1:35:31.200]  Elon Musk goes, why'd you do the lockdown?
[1:35:31.200 --> 1:35:33.200]  Cuba didn't even kill a few million people in the third world,
[1:35:33.200 --> 1:35:35.200]  but now you've killed 30 plus million.
[1:35:35.200 --> 1:35:40.200]  I mean, Elon must be listening or he must be doing his research.
[1:35:40.200 --> 1:35:42.200]  Because that's all true.
[1:35:42.200 --> 1:35:45.200]  The next time some mask wear gets in your face with a virtue signal,
[1:35:45.200 --> 1:35:48.200]  hey, your lockdowns have starved 35 million extra people to death.
[1:35:48.200 --> 1:35:50.200]  They'll probably say, well, there are too many people.
[1:35:50.200 --> 1:35:52.200]  Oh, then why are you wearing a mask?
[1:35:52.200 --> 1:35:54.200]  Because it's a symbol of the cult you're in
[1:35:54.200 --> 1:35:56.200]  and you feel power being in your cult,
[1:35:56.200 --> 1:35:59.200]  even though you're being run over by the cult you're in.
[1:35:59.200 --> 1:36:03.200]  You are a fool.
[1:36:03.200 --> 1:36:05.200]  But I've learned that's what it is about people in cults.
[1:36:05.200 --> 1:36:09.200]  They love being fools and they love being used by the controllers
[1:36:09.200 --> 1:36:12.200]  that want them dumbed down and enslaved.
[1:36:12.200 --> 1:36:14.200]  Well, my children are going to be free.
[1:36:14.200 --> 1:36:15.200]  You've got to be the opposite of that.
[1:36:15.200 --> 1:36:17.200]  You've got to be empowered, focused, aware,
[1:36:17.200 --> 1:36:20.200]  and knowing what I know and then taking us beyond that.
[1:36:20.200 --> 1:36:22.200]  I want you to save me.
[1:36:22.200 --> 1:36:24.200]  I need you to save me.
[1:36:24.200 --> 1:36:26.200]  I'm not trying to be your savior.
[1:36:26.200 --> 1:36:28.200]  I need you to save me and my family.
[1:36:28.200 --> 1:36:30.200]  Please save me and my family.
[1:36:30.200 --> 1:36:31.200]  We can only do this together.
[1:36:31.200 --> 1:36:33.200]  Please, only together can we get out of this.
[1:36:33.200 --> 1:36:35.200]  Please save me.
[1:36:35.200 --> 1:36:41.200]  God put us in a situation where we either come together or we die.
[1:36:41.200 --> 1:36:43.200]  And everything they do is to divide us
[1:36:43.200 --> 1:36:47.200]  and they're a bunch of horrible, evil, racist people of every color out there
[1:36:47.200 --> 1:36:50.200]  and that's real when you're getting pumping gas at 10 o'clock at night
[1:36:50.200 --> 1:36:55.200]  and some racist group of thugs are being mean to you because of what color you are.
[1:36:55.200 --> 1:36:58.200]  But you've got to see the programming and the culture
[1:36:58.200 --> 1:37:04.200]  and what the system's done to put you in that position for an in-game plan they've got.
[1:37:04.200 --> 1:37:07.200]  So this is a control collapse.
[1:37:07.200 --> 1:37:09.200]  The more we give in, the worse it gets.
[1:37:09.200 --> 1:37:13.200]  And they're going to launch a cyber attack or group of cyber attacks.
[1:37:13.200 --> 1:37:16.200]  The cut off of that pipeline was a test.
[1:37:16.200 --> 1:37:20.200]  The globalist operating system with their minions are we're guardians of the earth.
[1:37:20.200 --> 1:37:21.200]  There's too many people.
[1:37:21.200 --> 1:37:23.200]  We've got a mass call to save it.
[1:37:23.200 --> 1:37:25.200]  That's just what the mid-level cult members get told.
[1:37:25.200 --> 1:37:26.200]  The highest levels.
[1:37:26.200 --> 1:37:27.200]  They know it's all about transhumanism.
[1:37:27.200 --> 1:37:29.200]  Mergeral machines playing God.
[1:37:29.200 --> 1:37:35.200]  And getting rid of large populations they can't manage.
[1:37:35.200 --> 1:37:36.200]  And so that's their pretext.
[1:37:36.200 --> 1:37:38.200]  We've got to get rid of these populations.
[1:37:38.200 --> 1:37:40.200]  There's going to be limited resources.
[1:37:40.200 --> 1:37:44.200]  They're going to fight with each other over the resources.
[1:37:44.200 --> 1:37:51.200]  So we've got to just cut their resources off and give them an artificial culture-carbon war
[1:37:51.200 --> 1:38:00.200]  that depopulates them in a scientific orderly way instead of humans killing each other in the old-fashioned way.
[1:38:00.200 --> 1:38:07.200]  And I'm like, how about we just transcend all of that?
[1:38:07.200 --> 1:38:11.200]  Because I can tell you, if God showed up and said,
[1:38:11.200 --> 1:38:14.200]  I kill most of the people or everybody, you deserve it, you're an evil culture,
[1:38:14.200 --> 1:38:15.200]  I'd say I understand that.
[1:38:15.200 --> 1:38:17.200]  I wouldn't like it, but I'd get it.
[1:38:17.200 --> 1:38:27.200]  But this is Brian Stelter and Chris Cuomo's producer and Bill Gates and Klaus Schwab deciding they're going to kill everybody?
[1:38:27.200 --> 1:38:30.200]  Deciding they're going to bring in world government and censorship and control?
[1:38:30.200 --> 1:38:32.200]  No!
[1:38:32.200 --> 1:38:34.200]  I got a better idea.
[1:38:34.200 --> 1:38:39.200]  You're so into your ideology, you implement it on yourself, then I'll have some respect for you.
[1:38:39.200 --> 1:38:43.200]  You're a bunch of wannabe elitists.
[1:38:43.200 --> 1:38:46.200]  You're a bunch of garbage.
[1:38:46.200 --> 1:38:49.200]  Playing God, megalomaniac psychopaths,
[1:38:49.200 --> 1:38:55.200]  inbred generational wealth that's gotten together and decided that you're on some holy quest
[1:38:55.200 --> 1:38:59.200]  because when you go to the shopping mall or you see the general public, they look like a bunch of mutants
[1:38:59.200 --> 1:39:01.200]  and you want to get rid of them.
[1:39:01.200 --> 1:39:04.200]  Well, guess what, Klaus Schwab, you look like a mutant too.
[1:39:04.200 --> 1:39:08.200]  You're uglier than the ugliest people at Walmart.
[1:39:08.200 --> 1:39:13.200]  But you don't think I don't as a human instinctively see what's being set up
[1:39:13.200 --> 1:39:16.200]  or how they've done the masses down or how they've weaponized them
[1:39:16.200 --> 1:39:19.200]  or how they've made the public help make the public more evil?
[1:39:19.200 --> 1:39:25.200]  No, I get that they're making the public evil show that metaphysically they're allowed to kill them.
[1:39:25.200 --> 1:39:27.200]  It's a form of alchemy.
[1:39:27.200 --> 1:39:32.200]  And I'm simply here to let all those people know God's giving you a chance
[1:39:32.200 --> 1:39:36.200]  to repent of what you've done and to become straight and strong
[1:39:36.200 --> 1:39:40.200]  and then you'll be energized and you'll be fulfilled and you'll be empowered
[1:39:40.200 --> 1:39:43.200]  and you'll be able to stop this system.
[1:39:43.200 --> 1:39:46.200]  But if you don't care and you're too selfish to research this
[1:39:46.200 --> 1:39:49.200]  and you're too selfish to admit you're under attack, I mean, let me tell you something.
[1:39:49.200 --> 1:39:53.200]  I know a lot of tough guys and I like boxing and I like MMA
[1:39:53.200 --> 1:39:57.200]  and there's a part of me that thinks that's all really interesting and cool.
[1:39:57.200 --> 1:39:59.200]  But you know what's a lot cooler than that?
[1:39:59.200 --> 1:40:02.200]  Conor McGregor coming out and saying we shouldn't have forced injections.
[1:40:02.200 --> 1:40:04.200]  We shouldn't have vaccine passports.
[1:40:04.200 --> 1:40:07.200]  We should get out of the EU and I'm sick of the New World Order
[1:40:07.200 --> 1:40:10.200]  and I don't like global government and this vaccine's a bunch of crap
[1:40:10.200 --> 1:40:11.200]  and they're killing us.
[1:40:11.200 --> 1:40:13.200]  That's what he said in his full statement.
[1:40:13.200 --> 1:40:17.200]  Now, I don't care about Conor McGregor with his billionaire strut
[1:40:17.200 --> 1:40:23.200]  and you know, all that stupid crap and all that bling and coming out like a king and all that.
[1:40:23.200 --> 1:40:25.200]  That's pathetic behavior.
[1:40:25.200 --> 1:40:29.200]  But I went from thinking that guy's a joke to, well, maybe he's got a soul
[1:40:29.200 --> 1:40:33.200]  because he sees what's wrong and he's standing up for his country
[1:40:33.200 --> 1:40:35.200]  because that's where the war is.
[1:40:35.200 --> 1:40:39.200]  It's not guys walking into clubs and acting tough and, you know,
[1:40:39.200 --> 1:40:44.200]  men polishing their fancy car and jealous of their neighbor
[1:40:44.200 --> 1:40:46.200]  because they've got a newer model than they do.
[1:40:46.200 --> 1:40:50.200]  None of that means anything.
[1:40:50.200 --> 1:40:54.200]  It's about what you really stand for and who you really are right now
[1:40:54.200 --> 1:40:59.200]  and you're going to get tested and you need to know that
[1:40:59.200 --> 1:41:02.200]  I've got a very accurate track record on these big predictions
[1:41:02.200 --> 1:41:04.200]  and this isn't a prediction.
[1:41:04.200 --> 1:41:08.200]  Guaranteed they intend cyber attack, power outages,
[1:41:08.200 --> 1:41:13.200]  massive race war, dollar devaluation, proxy wars,
[1:41:13.200 --> 1:41:17.200]  massive corruption, new viruses being released.
[1:41:17.200 --> 1:41:23.200]  I'll just say it, I see that in the cards and all hell breaking loose the next 300 plus days.
[1:41:23.200 --> 1:41:30.200]  And so, again, if our governors don't need to sit there
[1:41:30.200 --> 1:41:33.200]  and, oh, well, you shouldn't have to take a shot, you know,
[1:41:33.200 --> 1:41:35.200]  only the old people need it, it doesn't work.
[1:41:35.200 --> 1:41:36.200]  It's a fraud.
[1:41:36.200 --> 1:41:37.200]  You got conned.
[1:41:37.200 --> 1:41:38.200]  You got lied to.
[1:41:38.200 --> 1:41:47.200]  And if DeSantis and Abbott and Paul and Holly and Cruz and all the rest of them
[1:41:47.200 --> 1:41:50.200]  don't come out with the full story.
[1:41:50.200 --> 1:41:54.200]  If Joe Rogan doesn't come out with the full story of it being on purpose
[1:41:54.200 --> 1:41:59.200]  and a takeover in the population, if Tucker Carlson doesn't do that,
[1:41:59.200 --> 1:42:04.200]  if Laura Ingram starting to do it, they're all basically almost there.
[1:42:04.200 --> 1:42:07.200]  Just tell people what's really going on.
[1:42:07.200 --> 1:42:08.200]  Yeah, you're going to get attacked.
[1:42:08.200 --> 1:42:10.200]  Yeah, it sounds crazy.
[1:42:10.200 --> 1:42:12.200]  But this destabilization is here.
[1:42:12.200 --> 1:42:14.200]  The defunding of the police is here.
[1:42:14.200 --> 1:42:15.200]  The design collapse is here.
[1:42:15.200 --> 1:42:18.200]  Injecting children with the HIV spike protein
[1:42:18.200 --> 1:42:21.200]  owned by Bill Gates and Fauci and joint patents
[1:42:21.200 --> 1:42:25.200]  that replicates in their body forever destroying their white blood cells is real.
[1:42:25.200 --> 1:42:28.200]  All around me where I live, I went to the drug store.
[1:42:28.200 --> 1:42:31.200]  There was little kids lined up with their parents last week and getting shots
[1:42:31.200 --> 1:42:35.200]  and almost threw up and I couldn't even videotape it because I got so upset.
[1:42:35.200 --> 1:42:40.200]  I stumbled out of there and I threw up in the parking lot
[1:42:40.200 --> 1:42:43.200]  because I was watching children being murdered.
[1:42:43.200 --> 1:42:48.200]  And it's normal to become dizzy and to go in the parking lot and throw up.
[1:42:48.200 --> 1:42:50.200]  And then I went home and shit myself.
[1:42:50.200 --> 1:42:51.200]  I was so upset.
[1:42:51.200 --> 1:42:52.200]  That's how real this is.
[1:42:52.200 --> 1:42:56.200]  You should be shitting yourselves right now.
[1:42:56.200 --> 1:43:02.200]  I've been fighting as hard as I can for almost 28 years against the globalist.
[1:43:02.200 --> 1:43:04.200]  I wanted to stop their agenda.
[1:43:04.200 --> 1:43:09.200]  I wanted to wake up the world and stop them dead in their tracks before they went operational.
[1:43:09.200 --> 1:43:10.200]  But we failed.
[1:43:10.200 --> 1:43:12.200]  Yes, a lot of people are awake.
[1:43:12.200 --> 1:43:14.200]  Yes, we're not getting caught flat footed,
[1:43:14.200 --> 1:43:20.200]  but they are going ahead with their full operational deindustrialization great reset.
[1:43:20.200 --> 1:43:22.200]  And that's why it's more important than ever
[1:43:22.200 --> 1:43:26.200]  that all viewers and all listeners tell everybody they know about the show
[1:43:26.200 --> 1:43:29.200]  because people are ready to wake up and ready to hear the truth.
[1:43:29.200 --> 1:43:32.200]  So we've got an information warfare of the enemy and trying to stop their agenda.
[1:43:32.200 --> 1:43:34.200]  We've also got to get personally prepared.
[1:43:34.200 --> 1:43:37.200]  And one of the number one things to do is high quality, storeable food.
[1:43:37.200 --> 1:43:42.200]  We've got the best food, ready to ship at very affordable prices at infowarstore.com.
[1:43:42.200 --> 1:43:46.200]  So whether it's a month or a six month or a year supply or specialty diets,

[1:43:50.200 --> 1:43:52.200]  and before there are long lines and waits.

[1:44:38.200 --> 1:44:41.200]  Urukoma Longipolia, originally from Malaysia,
[1:44:41.200 --> 1:44:43.200]  Makarou from Peru,
[1:44:43.200 --> 1:44:45.200]  Horny Goatweed from China,

[1:44:57.200 --> 1:45:00.200]  The CEO of Pfizer just came out and said that
[1:45:00.200 --> 1:45:04.200]  people talking bad about the vaccines are working for, quote,
[1:45:04.200 --> 1:45:05.200]  dark forces.
[1:45:05.200 --> 1:45:12.200]  The FBI and CIA have been advising him on who these evil groups are.
[1:45:12.200 --> 1:45:14.200]  They know that all over the world,
[1:45:14.200 --> 1:45:17.200]  their poison shot is being banned by major governments.
[1:45:17.200 --> 1:45:19.200]  And Moderna is in trouble as well.
[1:45:19.200 --> 1:45:22.200]  They know that the people are starting to get wise
[1:45:22.200 --> 1:45:24.200]  with this depopulation agenda.
[1:45:24.200 --> 1:45:27.200]  In fact, evidence is starting to mount that the shots
[1:45:27.200 --> 1:45:29.200]  were supposed to be soft kill weapons,
[1:45:29.200 --> 1:45:32.200]  but they're so deadly they're killing a higher percentage
[1:45:32.200 --> 1:45:36.200]  up front and so people are waking up.
[1:45:36.200 --> 1:45:39.200]  The weapons work a little too good.
[1:45:39.200 --> 1:45:42.200]  They're supposed to be silent weapons for quiet wars,
[1:45:42.200 --> 1:45:45.200]  but instead they're making too big of a noise.
[1:45:45.200 --> 1:45:47.200]  But it's too late for a return back now.
[1:45:47.200 --> 1:45:49.200]  They're coming after our children.
[1:45:49.200 --> 1:45:52.200]  So it's up to us to protect our little children,
[1:45:52.200 --> 1:45:54.200]  or God will not look favorably on us.
[1:45:54.200 --> 1:46:23.200]  Remember, God is watching.
[1:46:24.200 --> 1:46:27.200]  It's from the light of the sun.
[1:46:27.200 --> 1:46:33.200]  It is the symbol of our complete and total absolute surrender
[1:46:33.200 --> 1:46:34.200]  to evil.
[1:46:34.200 --> 1:46:39.200]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are crossing the Rubicon now.
[1:46:39.200 --> 1:46:42.200]  The entire future destiny of humanity is upon us.
[1:46:42.200 --> 1:46:44.200]  Klaus Schwab and the UN admit they're coming out
[1:46:44.200 --> 1:46:47.200]  with implantable microchips as part of the World ID
[1:46:47.200 --> 1:46:48.200]  and carbon taxes.
[1:46:48.200 --> 1:46:51.200]  Things only get worse from here if we submit.
[1:46:51.200 --> 1:46:54.200]  Things only get better if we resist and say no.
[1:46:54.200 --> 1:47:00.200]  Noncompliance, noncompliance, noncompliance.
[1:47:00.200 --> 1:47:04.200]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order,
[1:47:04.200 --> 1:47:18.200]  it's Alex Jones.
[1:47:18.200 --> 1:47:21.200]  Thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[1:47:21.200 --> 1:47:23.200]  Now, the end game is here.
[1:47:23.200 --> 1:47:28.200]  Global depopulation of at least 90% by the year 2030.
[1:47:28.200 --> 1:47:31.200]  Can humanity awaken and face the horror?
[1:47:31.200 --> 1:47:33.200]  Or will they?
[1:47:33.200 --> 1:47:34.200]  Live a denial.
[1:47:34.200 --> 1:47:38.200]  Be enslaved and be incrementally murdered.
[1:47:38.200 --> 1:47:42.200]  The permanent emergency is here, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:47:42.200 --> 1:47:45.200]  And on the other end of it, when you emerge from that tunnel,
[1:47:45.200 --> 1:47:47.200]  you'll be dead.
[1:47:47.200 --> 1:47:51.200]  We have a responsibility for our children and future generations
[1:47:51.200 --> 1:47:56.200]  to say no to this incredible corruption now.
[1:47:56.200 --> 1:48:00.200]  So, they plan to stage terror attacks connected to January 6th
[1:48:00.200 --> 1:48:03.200]  and claim that patriots that thought the election was fraudulent did it.
[1:48:03.200 --> 1:48:06.200]  They intend to stage terror attacks against big pharma installations
[1:48:06.200 --> 1:48:08.200]  or the Bill and Melinda Gates facilities
[1:48:08.200 --> 1:48:10.200]  and blame it on myself and others.
[1:48:10.200 --> 1:48:12.200]  That way you're not allowed to ever criticize,
[1:48:12.200 --> 1:48:15.200]  you know, the death shot factories and what they're doing
[1:48:15.200 --> 1:48:17.200]  or you're connected to the terrorist,
[1:48:17.200 --> 1:48:19.200]  which of course will be provocateur or carried out by them.
[1:48:19.200 --> 1:48:24.200]  They plan a stage cyber attack to bring down civilization as we know it.
[1:48:24.200 --> 1:48:27.200]  Klaus Schwab has said we might have power out for years.
[1:48:27.200 --> 1:48:32.200]  That would result in an 80% population reduction by itself.
[1:48:32.200 --> 1:48:35.200]  They've already gotten around a third of the people that work on power lines
[1:48:35.200 --> 1:48:37.200]  to be fired around the U.S.
[1:48:37.200 --> 1:48:39.200]  Around a third of the nurses, same thing with doctors.
[1:48:39.200 --> 1:48:42.200]  That's what their shortage is, the breakdown of society.
[1:48:42.200 --> 1:48:45.200]  They've already gotten a large part of our military kicked out.
[1:48:45.200 --> 1:48:48.200]  All of this is to undermine society.
[1:48:48.200 --> 1:48:53.200]  All of this is the collapse of civilization.
[1:48:53.200 --> 1:48:54.200]  I'll go back to it.
[1:48:54.200 --> 1:48:57.200]  If we don't realize what they're doing and don't realize their plan
[1:48:57.200 --> 1:49:01.200]  and argue with them like, man, Klaus Schwab and Bill Gates and Fauci are dumb.
[1:49:01.200 --> 1:49:03.200]  Man, this doesn't make sense.
[1:49:03.200 --> 1:49:06.200]  Now they want to take seven shots and now they want new lockdowns
[1:49:06.200 --> 1:49:08.200]  and, you know, now they're doing them.
[1:49:08.200 --> 1:49:10.200]  It doesn't make sense. Why are the hospitals full of vaccinated?
[1:49:10.200 --> 1:49:13.200]  They're censored because it's an attack.
[1:49:13.200 --> 1:49:17.200]  A smart attack is camouflaged.
[1:49:17.200 --> 1:49:21.200]  But the groups running this are all the heads of the most rich, powerful
[1:49:21.200 --> 1:49:29.200]  dynasties on earth that are obsessed with depopulation.
[1:49:29.200 --> 1:49:33.200]  Let's run through some of the news on this front.
[1:49:33.200 --> 1:49:39.200]  Texas creates hotline for employees to report workplace
[1:49:39.200 --> 1:49:41.200]  cases requiring COVID-19 vaccines.
[1:49:41.200 --> 1:49:43.200]  That's good news because what they're doing is criminal.
[1:49:43.200 --> 1:49:46.200]  It's illegal and it's very, very dangerous.
[1:49:46.200 --> 1:49:51.200]  Rand Paul vaccinated zealots won't be happy until they get your newborn,
[1:49:51.200 --> 1:49:53.200]  which he says your child doesn't need the shot.
[1:49:53.200 --> 1:49:55.200]  No, it just doesn't need it.
[1:49:55.200 --> 1:49:57.200]  It's like they don't need to be hit in the head with a hammer.
[1:49:57.200 --> 1:49:59.200]  It erases their immune system, Paul, and you know it.
[1:49:59.200 --> 1:50:08.200]  So please, Rand Paul, don't go from being a hero to being a zero.
[1:50:08.200 --> 1:50:13.200]  Queensland to allow grocery stores to ban unvaccinated.
[1:50:13.200 --> 1:50:16.200]  Oh, now it's food you can't have.
[1:50:16.200 --> 1:50:17.200]  Oh, yeah.
[1:50:17.200 --> 1:50:20.200]  And people at a checkpoint checking your vaccine status,
[1:50:20.200 --> 1:50:24.200]  which will be the social credit score to make sure you've been a good little slave.
[1:50:24.200 --> 1:50:26.200]  But it gets worse.
[1:50:26.200 --> 1:50:29.200]  South Korea is the most vaccinated country in the world.
[1:50:29.200 --> 1:50:31.200]  They're like one in 30-something with autism now.
[1:50:31.200 --> 1:50:32.200]  We're one in 50-something.
[1:50:32.200 --> 1:50:34.200]  Well, they follow all the rules.
[1:50:34.200 --> 1:50:36.200]  They have six G going in.
[1:50:36.200 --> 1:50:40.200]  South Korea to use facial recognition cameras to track COVID cases,
[1:50:40.200 --> 1:50:44.200]  ensure mass compliance with ground robots and drones.
[1:50:44.200 --> 1:50:46.200]  Isn't that liberal?
[1:50:46.200 --> 1:50:51.200]  Study face masks littering increased by 9,000% in first months of the pandemic
[1:50:51.200 --> 1:50:53.200]  may have helped spread the virus.
[1:50:53.200 --> 1:50:56.200]  Really, you think so?
[1:50:56.200 --> 1:50:58.200]  And it goes on from there.
[1:50:58.200 --> 1:51:03.200]  Don Lemon blames anti-mask conservatives for rising traffic accidents deaths.
[1:51:03.200 --> 1:51:06.200]  Hospitalizations mortality cut in half at a Brazilian city
[1:51:06.200 --> 1:51:12.200]  offered ivermectin to everyone pre-vaccine.
[1:51:12.200 --> 1:51:16.200]  Pfizer documents reveal a variety of vaccine side effects.
[1:51:16.200 --> 1:51:19.200]  Boy, RT has one whitewash of a headline.
[1:51:19.200 --> 1:51:21.200]  Thousands of deaths in just the first few months,
[1:51:21.200 --> 1:51:23.200]  thousands and thousands of miscarriages,
[1:51:23.200 --> 1:51:26.200]  heart attacks, microcarditis, yeah, those aren't side effects.
[1:51:26.200 --> 1:51:27.200]  That's the main effect.
[1:51:27.200 --> 1:51:28.200]  That's what they want to do.
[1:51:28.200 --> 1:51:31.200]  Several hundred Danes infected with Omnicron strain
[1:51:31.200 --> 1:51:33.200]  despite being jabbed three times.
[1:51:33.200 --> 1:51:35.200]  Now they say the answer is four,
[1:51:35.200 --> 1:51:37.200]  even though studies show it makes you get sicker.
[1:51:37.200 --> 1:51:42.200]  If you go to CNN, too, it's like 40% of new cases in the UK are Omnicron.
[1:51:42.200 --> 1:51:44.200]  They're shutting down again. It's over.
[1:51:44.200 --> 1:51:46.200]  We've got to have a vaccine mandate.
[1:51:46.200 --> 1:51:51.200]  Sorry, it's Omnicron, even though Omnicron doesn't even kill anybody.
[1:51:51.200 --> 1:51:55.200]  Doesn't matter. It's got a scary name, Omnicron.
[1:51:55.200 --> 1:51:59.200]  Oh, here's one out of foreign policy put out by the Washington Post,
[1:51:59.200 --> 1:52:01.200]  and it's the CFR that runs it.
[1:52:01.200 --> 1:52:04.200]  Only surveillance can save us from coronavirus.
[1:52:04.200 --> 1:52:08.200]  Yes, yes, only the technocracy.
[1:52:08.200 --> 1:52:10.200]  And it goes on and on and on.
[1:52:10.200 --> 1:52:13.200]  But there's good news, Governor Abbott saying it's illegal to do that,
[1:52:13.200 --> 1:52:14.200]  which it is.
[1:52:14.200 --> 1:52:17.200]  Maybe people give you vaccine status or have shots to work.
[1:52:17.200 --> 1:52:20.200]  Democrat governor says COVID emergency is over
[1:52:20.200 --> 1:52:22.200]  and he won't implement more mask mandates.
[1:52:22.200 --> 1:52:24.200]  That's by Cassandra Fairbanks.
[1:52:24.200 --> 1:52:29.200]  And it goes on that that's happening at Jared Poles, Colorado's,
[1:52:29.200 --> 1:52:31.200]  Polis, Colorado's governor.
[1:52:31.200 --> 1:52:34.200]  So that's some good news on that front as well.
[1:52:34.200 --> 1:52:39.200]  Another study finds that natural immunity protects better against infection than Pfizer.
[1:52:39.200 --> 1:52:41.200]  Yeah, there's an Israeli one that's 13 to 27 times.
[1:52:41.200 --> 1:52:43.200]  This one found similar numbers.
[1:52:43.200 --> 1:52:45.200]  And that's going with the fake numbers that actually helps you.
[1:52:45.200 --> 1:52:48.200]  Those are year old numbers that actually erases your immune system.
[1:52:48.200 --> 1:52:51.200]  Of course it does.
[1:52:51.200 --> 1:52:54.200]  Unbelievable.
[1:52:54.200 --> 1:53:01.200]  And just don't forget, don't ever forget
[1:53:01.200 --> 1:53:04.200]  that these individuals think you're a dumb animal
[1:53:04.200 --> 1:53:06.200]  and don't think you have a right to live
[1:53:06.200 --> 1:53:09.200]  and that they have created the HIV spike protein,
[1:53:09.200 --> 1:53:12.200]  itself very toxic to the body, attacking white blood cells,
[1:53:12.200 --> 1:53:15.200]  and that your body then creates that spike protein
[1:53:15.200 --> 1:53:18.200]  and you're permanently infected and the more shots you get,
[1:53:18.200 --> 1:53:21.200]  the sicker you get and they're such sadists.
[1:53:21.200 --> 1:53:23.200]  They want you to do it over and over again.
[1:53:23.200 --> 1:53:26.200]  Because if it's one shot and it kills you right away, it's too obvious,
[1:53:26.200 --> 1:53:28.200]  which it's been doing, but not, you know, it levels, I guess,
[1:53:28.200 --> 1:53:30.200]  something to wake the public up.
[1:53:30.200 --> 1:53:32.200]  So it's a bunch of shots, gives you a bunch of different disorders.
[1:53:32.200 --> 1:53:35.200]  Well, they can deny what's going on or try, but they can't.
[1:53:35.200 --> 1:53:38.200]  They put on the inserts, six months ago it causes heart attacks,
[1:53:38.200 --> 1:53:40.200]  and myocarditis.
[1:53:40.200 --> 1:53:42.200]  Just think about that.
[1:53:42.200 --> 1:53:46.200]  You know, there's a bunch of clips from yesterday that I didn't get to,
[1:53:46.200 --> 1:53:49.200]  that I think we should probably try to get to ahead of a special guest
[1:53:49.200 --> 1:53:54.200]  who's going to be joining us in studio.
[1:53:54.200 --> 1:53:58.200]  But man, I've got so many videos of people they admit have been paralyzed
[1:53:58.200 --> 1:54:00.200]  by the injections.
[1:54:00.200 --> 1:54:02.200]  The next segment, I want to play a couple of these.
[1:54:02.200 --> 1:54:04.200]  Here's one.
[1:54:04.200 --> 1:54:08.200]  Equestrian athlete Stephanie Gard developed pericarditis,
[1:54:08.200 --> 1:54:11.200]  that's the heart swelling, and became paralyzed from the knees down
[1:54:11.200 --> 1:54:14.200]  and able to walk days after the Pfizer vaccine.
[1:54:14.200 --> 1:54:17.200]  And then a 13-year-old Australian remains in the hospital undergoing therapy
[1:54:17.200 --> 1:54:20.200]  to learn how to walk again and function normally again.
[1:54:20.200 --> 1:54:23.200]  We're going to get to that, and then a lot of other key information.
[1:54:23.200 --> 1:54:26.200]  They're also putting out defibrillation heart attack kits
[1:54:26.200 --> 1:54:30.200]  in schools all over the world, because now they say it's normal,
[1:54:30.200 --> 1:54:33.200]  it's a new normal for children to have massive heart swelling
[1:54:33.200 --> 1:54:35.200]  and heart attacks when they take the shot.
[1:54:35.200 --> 1:54:37.200]  It's normal, it's okay.
[1:54:37.200 --> 1:54:39.200]  We're all heroes here.
[1:54:39.200 --> 1:54:41.200]  You took your shot, and now you're dying.
[1:54:41.200 --> 1:54:44.200]  Oh, now you're paralyzed.
[1:54:44.200 --> 1:54:46.200]  It's so cute, it's so sweet.
[1:54:46.200 --> 1:54:48.200]  All right, two things.
[1:54:48.200 --> 1:54:51.200]  It is your support that keeps this bulwark of truth on the air.
[1:54:51.200 --> 1:54:53.200]  We're fearless, we tell the truth.
[1:54:53.200 --> 1:54:56.200]  You support us getting great products, you keep us on air.
[1:54:56.200 --> 1:54:59.200]  And so, a couple of big announcements here.
[1:54:59.200 --> 1:55:01.200]  I want to tell you about the fact that Reset Wars,
[1:55:01.200 --> 1:55:03.200]  that we've talked about for months and months and months,
[1:55:03.200 --> 1:55:05.200]  is now available.
[1:55:05.200 --> 1:55:10.200]  Reset Wars Online Training is officially live for sale
[1:55:10.200 --> 1:55:15.200]  for 25% off until 11.59.
[1:55:15.200 --> 1:55:18.200]  That'd be AM, actually, Wednesday.
[1:55:18.200 --> 1:55:21.200]  So go to resetwars.com right now,
[1:55:21.200 --> 1:55:23.200]  and you'll see the official video.
[1:55:23.200 --> 1:55:27.200]  Watch it, sign up, and you'll get the login information shortly.
[1:55:27.200 --> 1:55:30.200]  It's like nothing I've ever done.
[1:55:30.200 --> 1:55:33.200]  It's never been covered in my show.
[1:55:33.200 --> 1:55:38.200]  It's private information that you cannot break down on the show,
[1:55:38.200 --> 1:55:41.200]  just because of so many issues and time constraints.
[1:55:41.200 --> 1:55:45.200]  We've already gotten accounts banned before we even launched it.
[1:55:45.200 --> 1:55:48.200]  There's been major espionage to stop us behind the scenes.
[1:55:48.200 --> 1:55:53.200]  So I cannot promise how long this website, resetwars.com, will be live.
[1:55:53.200 --> 1:55:56.200]  So we're doing a 25% off limited time,
[1:55:56.200 --> 1:55:59.200]  so you can make sure you get the information before it's too late.
[1:55:59.200 --> 1:56:01.200]  And usually with other folks, that's a marketing gimmick.
[1:56:01.200 --> 1:56:03.200]  With us, it's not. You know that.
[1:56:03.200 --> 1:56:07.200]  Vice News has already attacked resetwars.com before it even was released.
[1:56:07.200 --> 1:56:11.200]  They are so scared of this information getting out.
[1:56:11.200 --> 1:56:16.200]  So time is of the essence for you to buy resetwars today
[1:56:16.200 --> 1:56:19.200]  and take your understanding of the globalist operations to the next level
[1:56:19.200 --> 1:56:22.200]  at www.resetwars.com.
[1:56:22.200 --> 1:56:27.200]  You know they've subpoenaed me and want to shut down our operations ASAP.
[1:56:27.200 --> 1:56:30.200]  So this will likely get shut down.
[1:56:30.200 --> 1:56:33.200]  So we're going to be 25% off to make sure you join today
[1:56:33.200 --> 1:56:36.200]  before we lose this website and this information
[1:56:36.200 --> 1:56:39.200]  so you can download it and save it and have it in your archives.
[1:56:39.200 --> 1:56:45.200]  Go to resetwars.com and get 25% off and become a founding member
[1:56:45.200 --> 1:56:48.200]  of so many of the important things we're going to be launching
[1:56:48.200 --> 1:56:51.200]  from the support you do going and signing up for this.
[1:56:51.200 --> 1:56:53.200]  And we're going to be launching new shows that are only there.
[1:56:53.200 --> 1:56:57.200]  We're going to be launching special masterclasses with other experts.
[1:56:57.200 --> 1:57:00.200]  We're going to be really drilling down into the 10 chapters.
[1:57:00.200 --> 1:57:02.200]  There's 10 chapters in this, 6 plus hours.
[1:57:02.200 --> 1:57:06.200]  We're going to be drilling down with more content that's coming that deals with all of that.
[1:57:06.200 --> 1:57:12.200]  But I mean this is cutting edge, quantum physics, psychological warfare, MKUltra.
[1:57:12.200 --> 1:57:14.200]  I mean they fear us for a reason.
[1:57:14.200 --> 1:57:16.200]  We've studied what's really going on in the universe.
[1:57:16.200 --> 1:57:19.200]  We understand that it's not just what they call things, what things actually do.
[1:57:19.200 --> 1:57:22.200]  That's what resetwars.com does.
[1:57:22.200 --> 1:57:25.200]  So you've got less than 48 hours to get 25% off
[1:57:25.200 --> 1:57:30.200]  and then on Wednesday it goes live at resetwars.com.
[1:57:30.200 --> 1:57:33.200]  I want to thank you all for your support.
[1:57:33.200 --> 1:57:36.200]  All right, we're going to start the third hour
[1:57:36.200 --> 1:57:39.200]  and we're going to get into how we break free from the matrix
[1:57:39.200 --> 1:57:41.200]  and how we defeat the globalist.
[1:57:41.200 --> 1:57:43.200]  This is next level stuff with the enemy fears.
[1:57:43.200 --> 1:57:46.200]  Stay with us.
[1:57:46.200 --> 1:57:48.200]  Let's go ahead and take another call.
[1:57:48.200 --> 1:57:50.200]  Alex Jones here with a very important announcement
[1:57:50.200 --> 1:57:53.200]  to all of our listeners, viewers and supporters.
[1:57:53.200 --> 1:57:57.200]  We are attempting to develop and deploy systems
[1:57:57.200 --> 1:58:00.200]  that allow the American people, not just info wars,
[1:58:00.200 --> 1:58:02.200]  to get around corporate sensors
[1:58:02.200 --> 1:58:05.200]  and get the truth out about the New World Order's agenda
[1:58:05.200 --> 1:58:07.200]  so we can stop at deadnet's tracks.
[1:58:07.200 --> 1:58:10.200]  And so when you visit 1776coin.com
[1:58:10.200 --> 1:58:14.200]  you don't just have the opportunity to get an amazing one run,
[1:58:14.200 --> 1:58:16.200]  limited edition silver coin,
[1:58:16.200 --> 1:58:20.200]  made it right here in America with incredible historical artwork on it.
[1:58:20.200 --> 1:58:24.200]  You will also be funding a very serious,
[1:58:24.200 --> 1:58:27.200]  focused information warfare operation
[1:58:27.200 --> 1:58:29.200]  against the New World Order.
[1:58:29.200 --> 1:58:31.200]  So I want to thank you all for your past support
[1:58:31.200 --> 1:58:33.200]  and I want to encourage you now to not wait
[1:58:33.200 --> 1:58:37.200]  and to not procrastinate and to go to 1776coin.com.
[1:58:37.200 --> 1:58:39.200]  I would imagine that we will sell out of this limited run
[1:58:39.200 --> 1:58:42.200]  of 10,000 coins in only a few weeks,
[1:58:42.200 --> 1:58:43.200]  maybe a few days.
[1:58:43.200 --> 1:58:48.200]  So secure your coin now at 1776coin.com.
[1:58:48.200 --> 1:58:51.200]  The purpose of fear is to call us into action
[1:58:51.200 --> 1:58:53.200]  and there is plenty to be afraid of today.
[1:58:53.200 --> 1:58:56.200]  Half the population has lined up for an untested,
[1:58:56.200 --> 1:58:59.200]  deadly and debilitating experimental injection
[1:58:59.200 --> 1:59:03.200]  because they were told to be afraid of an invisible asymptomatic disease.
[1:59:03.200 --> 1:59:06.200]  The perpetrators of all this have clearly stated their goal
[1:59:06.200 --> 1:59:10.200]  of having 80% of the population hooked up to an artificial intelligence
[1:59:10.200 --> 1:59:13.200]  hive mind in less than nine years.
[1:59:13.200 --> 1:59:15.200]  For those of us who have awoken from the spell,
[1:59:15.200 --> 1:59:17.200]  we know this is all really happening
[1:59:17.200 --> 1:59:20.200]  and it's unbelievably unsettling to see.
[1:59:20.200 --> 1:59:23.200]  But there is only two things to do.
[1:59:23.200 --> 1:59:26.200]  We continue sounding the alarm because it's a numbers game.
[1:59:26.200 --> 1:59:29.200]  If enough people awaken from the cold spell, then we win.
[1:59:29.200 --> 1:59:32.200]  But even when we win, and we eventually will,
[1:59:32.200 --> 1:59:35.200]  the days of convenience are soon coming to an end.
[1:59:35.200 --> 1:59:39.200]  And so we must prepare, get up to a year's worth of storable foods,
[1:59:39.200 --> 1:59:44.200]  water filtration, survival gear, seeds, shortwave radios
[1:59:44.200 --> 1:59:51.200]  and life-saving knowledge at infoorstore.com.
[1:59:51.200 --> 1:59:55.200]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[2:00:06.200 --> 2:00:12.200]  What is the secret of Silent Green?
[2:00:12.200 --> 2:00:17.200]  The world is being artificially put into a cascade of crises
[2:00:17.200 --> 2:00:21.200]  that will lead to the accelerated controlled collapse
[2:00:21.200 --> 2:00:24.200]  and the mass death of billions upon billions of people.
[2:00:24.200 --> 2:00:28.200]  New York City, in the year 2022,
[2:00:28.200 --> 2:00:32.200]  nothing runs anymore, nothing works,
[2:00:32.200 --> 2:00:34.200]  but the people are the same,
[2:00:34.200 --> 2:00:37.200]  and the people will do anything to get what they need.
[2:00:37.200 --> 2:00:38.200]  This is the police!
[2:00:38.200 --> 2:00:42.200]  What they need most is Silent Green.
[2:00:42.200 --> 2:00:45.200]  The supply of Silent Green has been exhausted.
[2:00:45.200 --> 2:00:47.200]  They can try to ignore general public,
[2:00:47.200 --> 2:00:50.200]  ignore this scientist, this doctor, this study,
[2:00:50.200 --> 2:00:52.200]  but when you have a major respect government,
[2:00:52.200 --> 2:00:54.200]  the Japanese are smart as you get.
[2:00:54.200 --> 2:00:56.200]  Say, okay, this is causing heart attacks
[2:00:56.200 --> 2:00:58.200]  and myocarditis at a very high level.
[2:00:58.200 --> 2:00:59.200]  It's not rare.
[2:00:59.200 --> 2:01:01.200]  That validates the mountains of other evidence.
[2:01:01.200 --> 2:01:03.200]  Psychologists, we could potentially be sterilizing
[2:01:03.200 --> 2:01:05.200]  an entire generation with COVID vaccines.
[2:01:05.200 --> 2:01:07.200]  Yeah, that's what we know it's doing.
[2:01:07.200 --> 2:01:08.200]  Now it's all confirmed.
[2:01:08.200 --> 2:01:11.200]  First batch of Pfizer's COVID-19 vaccine documents revealed
[2:01:11.200 --> 2:01:17.200]  42,000 reaction reports, 101,223 deaths
[2:01:17.200 --> 2:01:19.200]  just in the first few weeks of it.
[2:01:19.200 --> 2:01:21.200]  The die-offs are accelerating.
[2:01:21.200 --> 2:01:23.200]  The stillbirths are accelerating.
[2:01:23.200 --> 2:01:25.200]  The establishment hasn't been able to achieve
[2:01:25.200 --> 2:01:28.200]  what they wanted with the Omicron Hysteria,
[2:01:28.200 --> 2:01:31.200]  and so they're going to play another card.
[2:01:31.200 --> 2:01:33.200]  And the card that it looks like they're going to play
[2:01:33.200 --> 2:01:35.200]  sometime in 2022
[2:01:35.200 --> 2:01:39.200]  is the false flag cyber attack on the financial infrastructure.
[2:01:39.200 --> 2:01:41.200]  When you talk about something like cyber warfare,
[2:01:41.200 --> 2:01:43.200]  it's actually quite cheap and quite easy
[2:01:43.200 --> 2:01:46.200]  for a country to develop a cyber weapon.
[2:01:46.200 --> 2:01:48.200]  And that cyber weapon can have equivalent effects.
[2:01:48.200 --> 2:01:51.200]  You can have a cyber weapon potentially shut down the power grid,
[2:01:51.200 --> 2:01:54.200]  for example, on the whole East Coast.
[2:01:54.200 --> 2:01:55.200]  New York is out.
[2:01:55.200 --> 2:01:56.200]  Wall Street is out.
[2:01:56.200 --> 2:01:57.200]  All your banks are out.
[2:01:57.200 --> 2:01:59.200]  You can't even withdraw money.
[2:01:59.200 --> 2:02:01.200]  You can imagine people panic starting
[2:02:01.200 --> 2:02:03.200]  and people trying to get cash.
[2:02:03.200 --> 2:02:06.200]  You can't get cash. ATMs aren't working.
[2:02:06.200 --> 2:02:08.200]  Things like your water waste and treatment plants aren't working.
[2:02:08.200 --> 2:02:09.200]  There's no clean water.
[2:02:09.200 --> 2:02:11.200]  There's going to be a run on stores.
[2:02:11.200 --> 2:02:12.200]  Stores potentially aren't even operating.
[2:02:12.200 --> 2:02:14.200]  Your credit card is not going to work at the store.
[2:02:14.200 --> 2:02:17.200]  There'll be absolutely mass panic.
[2:02:17.200 --> 2:02:19.200]  If you can blind the U.S. military,
[2:02:19.200 --> 2:02:22.200]  if you can shut down our GPS and our computer networks,
[2:02:22.200 --> 2:02:25.200]  our military is basically unable to function.
[2:02:25.200 --> 2:02:27.200]  And what most people aren't thinking about,
[2:02:27.200 --> 2:02:29.200]  that's on my mind right now, Alex,
[2:02:29.200 --> 2:02:32.200]  is the social chaos implications
[2:02:32.200 --> 2:02:36.200]  of the freezing of the financial infrastructure in America.
[2:02:36.200 --> 2:02:39.200]  I think it's the union leader for the L.A. police saying,
[2:02:39.200 --> 2:02:41.200]  don't come to L.A.
[2:02:41.200 --> 2:02:44.200]  That's the beginning of what's going to be really no-go zones.
[2:02:44.200 --> 2:02:47.200]  My message to anybody considering coming to Los Angeles,
[2:02:47.200 --> 2:02:49.200]  especially during the holiday season, is don't.
[2:02:49.200 --> 2:02:51.200]  We can't guarantee your safety.
[2:02:51.200 --> 2:02:53.200]  It is really, really out of control.
[2:02:53.200 --> 2:02:55.200]  I said it to people before.
[2:02:55.200 --> 2:02:57.200]  It's like that movie Purge.
[2:02:57.200 --> 2:02:59.200]  Instead of 24-hour skim at your crime,
[2:02:59.200 --> 2:03:03.200]  these bad people have 365 days to commit whatever they want.
[2:03:03.200 --> 2:03:07.200]  They may at some point tweet out a map of L.A.
[2:03:07.200 --> 2:03:10.200]  and they'll just draw, you know, 50 square blocks
[2:03:10.200 --> 2:03:13.200]  and say, these are no-police zones.
[2:03:13.200 --> 2:03:16.200]  But what's going to trigger that is the freezing
[2:03:16.200 --> 2:03:18.200]  of the financial system, which could be engineered,
[2:03:18.200 --> 2:03:21.200]  and it could be used to blame it on China
[2:03:21.200 --> 2:03:24.200]  so that Biden can then go ahead and stage
[2:03:24.200 --> 2:03:26.200]  some kind of conflict with China
[2:03:26.200 --> 2:03:29.200]  and use that to declare domestic martial law
[2:03:29.200 --> 2:03:31.200]  under a wartime emergency.
[2:03:31.200 --> 2:03:34.200]  Remember, they have to have perpetual emergencies.
[2:03:34.200 --> 2:03:37.200]  And since the COVID emergency is kind of petering out,
[2:03:37.200 --> 2:03:39.200]  you know, people just aren't buying it anymore,
[2:03:39.200 --> 2:03:41.200]  they need another bigger emergency
[2:03:41.200 --> 2:03:43.200]  in order to keep people in line.
[2:03:43.200 --> 2:03:46.200]  And so war is one, financial collapse is one,
[2:03:46.200 --> 2:03:48.200]  but Alex, and you know this very well,
[2:03:48.200 --> 2:03:50.200]  your audience knows this,
[2:03:50.200 --> 2:03:52.200]  what happens when the food stamps stop working,
[2:03:52.200 --> 2:03:54.200]  when the ATMs stop working,
[2:03:54.200 --> 2:03:56.200]  when these actions are frozen.
[2:03:56.200 --> 2:03:59.200]  What they want is for productive citizens to be gone
[2:03:59.200 --> 2:04:03.200]  and the actual income earners and producers
[2:04:03.200 --> 2:04:06.200]  in cities to flee, and that's happening right now.
[2:04:06.200 --> 2:04:08.200]  Well, I totally agree with you,
[2:04:08.200 --> 2:04:10.200]  and we're talking about escape from New York's scenario,
[2:04:10.200 --> 2:04:13.200]  which is the globalist plan to make much of the West
[2:04:13.200 --> 2:04:15.200]  no-go zones. This has been planned.
[2:04:15.200 --> 2:04:17.200]  Now, the police aren't in on this,
[2:04:17.200 --> 2:04:19.200]  they're just going to be put in a position
[2:04:19.200 --> 2:04:21.200]  where this is what's going to happen.
[2:04:21.200 --> 2:04:23.200]  They're being cut in half, they're being defunded,
[2:04:23.200 --> 2:04:25.200]  and this has all been part of the larger plan
[2:04:25.200 --> 2:04:27.200]  to collapse the country, and then the globalists go,
[2:04:27.200 --> 2:04:29.200]  oh look, you collapsed on your own.
[2:04:29.200 --> 2:04:31.200]  As you mentioned, or get a little prelude to,
[2:04:31.200 --> 2:04:33.200]  the Communist Chinese dailies are all like,
[2:04:33.200 --> 2:04:35.200]  America's a race war, they're a failure,
[2:04:35.200 --> 2:04:37.200]  they're cities have collapsed, they're a joke,
[2:04:37.200 --> 2:04:41.200]  and then their clients, Bill Gates and their minions,
[2:04:41.200 --> 2:04:44.200]  like President Biden, are doing this.
[2:04:44.200 --> 2:04:47.200]  So this is a war, and COVID's a war,
[2:04:47.200 --> 2:04:49.200]  and devaluing our currencies a war,
[2:04:49.200 --> 2:04:51.200]  and annihilating our borders is a war.
[2:04:51.200 --> 2:04:53.200]  The country is going down.
[2:04:56.200 --> 2:04:58.200]  Alex Jones here to make...
[2:05:00.200 --> 2:05:02.200]  Get our great bag of it here.
[2:05:02.200 --> 2:05:03.200]  I mean, this is from, people say,
[2:05:03.200 --> 2:05:06.200]  why is it from Chiapas, Mexico, the Communist?
[2:05:06.200 --> 2:05:08.200]  Well, that's where some of the best coffee in the world,
[2:05:08.200 --> 2:05:11.200]  that's wild harvested, above organic,
[2:05:11.200 --> 2:05:13.200]  in the volcanic soil, better than Guatemalan coffee,
[2:05:13.200 --> 2:05:15.200]  and yeah, we buy it from the little farmers
[2:05:15.200 --> 2:05:17.200]  that, you know, the media calls Communists,
[2:05:17.200 --> 2:05:18.200]  but really, they're just a commune,
[2:05:18.200 --> 2:05:20.200]  and whatever the point is, is that it's good coffee,
[2:05:20.200 --> 2:05:22.200]  and we've got it, and the farmers don't let
[2:05:22.200 --> 2:05:23.200]  the Mexican government take over,
[2:05:23.200 --> 2:05:25.200]  so I actually buy this from the Mexican rebels,
[2:05:25.200 --> 2:05:27.200]  and I've been buying it for, what, 14 years,
[2:05:27.200 --> 2:05:28.200]  and the price has never gone up.
[2:05:28.200 --> 2:05:30.200]  The same stuff's sold at Whole Foods under another name,
[2:05:30.200 --> 2:05:32.200]  for about 50% more, for a pound,
[2:05:32.200 --> 2:05:34.200]  and I just think it's some of the best coffee
[2:05:34.200 --> 2:05:35.200]  you're gonna find anywhere.
[2:05:35.200 --> 2:05:37.200]  It's Wake Up America, Patriot Blend,
[2:05:37.200 --> 2:05:39.200]  from the Chiapas rebels, literally.
[2:05:39.200 --> 2:05:41.200]  In fact, I'm gonna tell you a little story.
[2:05:44.200 --> 2:05:45.200]  Yeah, I'd like that.
[2:05:45.200 --> 2:05:46.200]  Okay, if you wanna believe it.
[2:05:46.200 --> 2:05:49.200]  Anyway, so it's infowarstore.com,
[2:05:49.200 --> 2:05:51.200]  and that's how we fund this operation,
[2:05:51.200 --> 2:06:20.200]  and if you don't find us, you don't wanna share, that's fine.
[2:06:20.200 --> 2:06:25.200]  Now into hour number three, and big news is breaking.
[2:06:25.200 --> 2:06:27.200]  The globalists are betting their whole takeover
[2:06:27.200 --> 2:06:30.200]  and the next stone election in 330 days
[2:06:30.200 --> 2:06:32.200]  on this CNN headline.
[2:06:32.200 --> 2:06:37.200]  Democrat Governor, we were one vice president
[2:06:37.200 --> 2:06:40.200]  away from a coup.
[2:06:40.200 --> 2:06:44.200]  Governor Jay Inslee says this party
[2:06:44.200 --> 2:06:47.200]  has to tell voters what's at risk during the 2022 elections,
[2:06:47.200 --> 2:06:51.200]  but Democrats aren't sure most voters care.
[2:06:51.200 --> 2:06:54.200]  Oh, another good Republican rhino.
[2:06:54.200 --> 2:06:58.200]  Oh, Alex Jones planned it with Trump to overthrow the Capitol.
[2:06:58.200 --> 2:07:00.200]  No, we plan to have a big massive rally
[2:07:00.200 --> 2:07:01.200]  so they'd have a 10-day investigation
[2:07:01.200 --> 2:07:02.200]  of the Senate that's constitutional
[2:07:02.200 --> 2:07:05.200]  that Democrats have had before,
[2:07:05.200 --> 2:07:07.200]  and they provocateur a bunch of people
[2:07:07.200 --> 2:07:09.200]  and some fools went in.
[2:07:09.200 --> 2:07:13.200]  Maybe 600 out of a million people.
[2:07:13.200 --> 2:07:16.200]  Oh, Democrat governors worry about a threat to democracy.
[2:07:16.200 --> 2:07:18.200]  It's the build back better, it's the great reset,
[2:07:18.200 --> 2:07:21.200]  it's the new world order takeover destroying our borders,
[2:07:21.200 --> 2:07:23.200]  our sovereignty, our dollar, our currency,
[2:07:23.200 --> 2:07:26.200]  and creating psychological warfare to make us depressed
[2:07:26.200 --> 2:07:29.200]  and alone with record suicide, record violence,
[2:07:29.200 --> 2:07:31.200]  record road rage.
[2:07:31.200 --> 2:07:34.200]  With Klaus Schwab bragging, he wants us angry
[2:07:34.200 --> 2:07:37.200]  so we all hurt each other and then ask them for a solution.
[2:07:37.200 --> 2:07:39.200]  In 2002, documents came out,
[2:07:39.200 --> 2:07:41.200]  and the BBC back when they sold their job
[2:07:41.200 --> 2:07:44.200]  with Greg Paulus, the investigative journalist on my show,
[2:07:44.200 --> 2:07:47.200]  and there was a 100-point IMF plan,
[2:07:47.200 --> 2:07:50.200]  just type in 100-point IMF plan, Greg Paulus,
[2:07:50.200 --> 2:07:53.200]  or IMF plan for martial law, Greg Paulus,
[2:07:53.200 --> 2:07:55.200]  click web or click the way back machine to find it
[2:07:55.200 --> 2:07:58.200]  because it's 16, 17 years old.
[2:07:58.200 --> 2:08:01.200]  And they said, we've collapsed third world countries.
[2:08:01.200 --> 2:08:03.200]  We've taken them over and put them in debt.
[2:08:03.200 --> 2:08:05.200]  Now we're going to do it to the rich countries in Europe,
[2:08:05.200 --> 2:08:08.200]  North America, Asia, Australia, New Zealand,
[2:08:08.200 --> 2:08:10.200]  and they've done it.
[2:08:10.200 --> 2:08:13.200]  And they use psychological warfare to crush society,
[2:08:13.200 --> 2:08:15.200]  destroy currencies, collapse the systems,
[2:08:15.200 --> 2:08:17.200]  and then they come in as the saviors
[2:08:17.200 --> 2:08:19.200]  with their martial plans later.
[2:08:19.200 --> 2:08:21.200]  But it's mainly psychological.
[2:08:21.200 --> 2:08:24.200]  If we're aware of their plan, if we're aware of their takeover,
[2:08:24.200 --> 2:08:26.200]  if we're aware that they're the bad guys,
[2:08:26.200 --> 2:08:28.200]  and we have leaders that stand up and say,
[2:08:28.200 --> 2:08:30.200]  no, we say, no, they fail.
[2:08:30.200 --> 2:08:33.200]  But if we don't know about their great reset, it's over.
[2:08:33.200 --> 2:08:37.200]  So it's got to be, first we're talking a year ago,
[2:08:37.200 --> 2:08:40.200]  then we did an interview with me over six months ago,
[2:08:40.200 --> 2:08:43.200]  and I said, you know, this is really very important,
[2:08:43.200 --> 2:08:45.200]  what you're talking about.
[2:08:45.200 --> 2:08:47.200]  He was laying out some of the things that I've broken down
[2:08:47.200 --> 2:08:49.200]  and some of the issues we've laid out,
[2:08:49.200 --> 2:08:51.200]  and then his own research that's excellent as well
[2:08:51.200 --> 2:08:53.200]  that I totally agree with.
[2:08:53.200 --> 2:08:56.200]  Jake Ducey is a best-selling author of Into the Wind,
[2:08:56.200 --> 2:08:59.200]  The Purpose, Principles, and Profit from Happiness.
[2:08:59.200 --> 2:09:02.200]  Jake has reached millions of people with his online videos,
[2:09:02.200 --> 2:09:04.200]  really hundreds of millions.
[2:09:04.200 --> 2:09:06.200]  His main YouTube channel has amassed more than
[2:09:06.200 --> 2:09:09.200]  600 plus thousand subscribers at 100 million views
[2:09:09.200 --> 2:09:11.200]  with the focus on personal development.
[2:09:11.200 --> 2:09:14.200]  And his newest YouTube channel is called I Love Prosperity.
[2:09:14.200 --> 2:09:17.200]  It pulls in over 2 million monthly viewers
[2:09:17.200 --> 2:09:20.200]  on the subject of precious metals and personal freedom.
[2:09:20.200 --> 2:09:23.200]  And he helped me launch resetwars.com.
[2:09:23.200 --> 2:09:26.200]  If you've heard of self-help and you've heard of all this stuff,
[2:09:26.200 --> 2:09:27.200]  this is next level.
[2:09:27.200 --> 2:09:29.200]  Everything we do is next level.
[2:09:29.200 --> 2:09:30.200]  Thanks to you supporting us.
[2:09:30.200 --> 2:09:32.200]  But I can tell you, this is next level.
[2:09:32.200 --> 2:09:34.200]  And Jake always corrects me.
[2:09:34.200 --> 2:09:36.200]  He said, no Alex, today's the day.
[2:09:36.200 --> 2:09:38.200]  People can see the course.
[2:09:38.200 --> 2:09:42.200]  We're running the discount until Wednesday of 25% off.
[2:09:42.200 --> 2:09:44.200]  So I get so flustered and so out of control
[2:09:44.200 --> 2:09:47.200]  and so wild out around here that resetwars doesn't just
[2:09:47.200 --> 2:09:49.200]  launch today for a discount to pre-order.
[2:09:49.200 --> 2:09:53.200]  It's now available right now at resetwars.com.
[2:09:53.200 --> 2:09:55.200]  So Jake, a lot of work has gone into this.
[2:09:55.200 --> 2:09:58.200]  We worked seven days a week, many weeks,
[2:09:58.200 --> 2:10:00.200]  dozens of hours a day just on this,
[2:10:00.200 --> 2:10:02.200]  sometimes until two in the morning.
[2:10:02.200 --> 2:10:03.200]  Well, one night you stayed up all night
[2:10:03.200 --> 2:10:05.200]  helping me do more research.
[2:10:05.200 --> 2:10:07.200]  And then we even stopped the release a while back
[2:10:07.200 --> 2:10:10.200]  and decided to add more because more information came out.
[2:10:10.200 --> 2:10:13.200]  I mean, this really is the skeleton key
[2:10:13.200 --> 2:10:14.200]  to unlock the door.
[2:10:14.200 --> 2:10:16.200]  This really is the secret weapon.
[2:10:16.200 --> 2:10:18.200]  Yeah, so for everyone listening,
[2:10:18.200 --> 2:10:19.200]  this is a huge announcement.
[2:10:19.200 --> 2:10:21.200]  I'm someone just like you.
[2:10:21.200 --> 2:10:24.200]  I've watched Alex for a decade.
[2:10:24.200 --> 2:10:27.200]  And this is unlike anything he's ever done.
[2:10:27.200 --> 2:10:30.200]  You go to resetwars.com right now.
[2:10:30.200 --> 2:10:31.200]  You'll see it's live.
[2:10:31.200 --> 2:10:33.200]  You can actually get the course today.
[2:10:33.200 --> 2:10:36.200]  This is an online training that's unlike the show,
[2:10:36.200 --> 2:10:38.200]  unlike anything he's ever done,
[2:10:38.200 --> 2:10:42.200]  breaking down all of these exercises and systems
[2:10:42.200 --> 2:10:44.200]  that we need to start putting in place
[2:10:44.200 --> 2:10:46.200]  in our life for you to protect yourself
[2:10:46.200 --> 2:10:48.200]  and for you to protect your family.
[2:10:48.200 --> 2:10:51.200]  And all of this crazy stuff is happening, right?
[2:10:51.200 --> 2:10:53.200]  You were talking just a minute ago about,
[2:10:53.200 --> 2:10:55.200]  well, maybe the next step
[2:10:55.200 --> 2:10:57.200]  is that they do a financial cyber attack.
[2:10:57.200 --> 2:10:59.200]  And I started saying to myself,
[2:10:59.200 --> 2:11:02.200]  well, imagine if all of these things happen, right?
[2:11:02.200 --> 2:11:05.200]  Imagine if they move towards this digital ID system.
[2:11:05.200 --> 2:11:07.200]  Imagine if they do a planned demolition
[2:11:07.200 --> 2:11:09.200]  of the economic system.
[2:11:09.200 --> 2:11:12.200]  And imagine if I was just so caught up
[2:11:12.200 --> 2:11:14.200]  in what was happening
[2:11:14.200 --> 2:11:18.200]  that I was never able to prepare myself,
[2:11:18.200 --> 2:11:21.200]  my finances, and my family accordingly.
[2:11:21.200 --> 2:11:24.200]  And this online course resetwars is a system
[2:11:24.200 --> 2:11:28.200]  that shows you the exact step-by-step process
[2:11:28.200 --> 2:11:31.200]  for this war on our mind and this war on our soul.
[2:11:31.200 --> 2:11:33.200]  We were already attacked by Vice News before it even came out.
[2:11:33.200 --> 2:11:35.200]  They called me a hypnotist for some reason.
[2:11:35.200 --> 2:11:37.200]  I think it's because we were talking about
[2:11:37.200 --> 2:11:40.200]  declassified CIA documents on hypnotism.
[2:11:40.200 --> 2:11:41.200]  They don't want this out.
[2:11:41.200 --> 2:11:43.200]  And if you're watching this,
[2:11:43.200 --> 2:11:46.200]  obviously you know one of the most important things
[2:11:46.200 --> 2:11:48.200]  that keeps this system going
[2:11:48.200 --> 2:11:50.200]  is through your financial support
[2:11:50.200 --> 2:11:53.200]  of the amazing products and supplements that they have.
[2:11:53.200 --> 2:11:55.200]  But one of the issues that is happening
[2:11:55.200 --> 2:11:58.200]  as they're moving forward with the great reset
[2:11:58.200 --> 2:12:00.200]  is to destroy small businesses
[2:12:00.200 --> 2:12:02.200]  by shutting supply chains down.
[2:12:02.200 --> 2:12:05.200]  Having this online course available
[2:12:05.200 --> 2:12:08.200]  is a bulletproof way for Alex
[2:12:08.200 --> 2:12:10.200]  and the rest of the Info Wars team
[2:12:10.200 --> 2:12:13.200]  to continue to work with you
[2:12:13.200 --> 2:12:15.200]  to win this war.
[2:12:15.200 --> 2:12:17.200]  It's a bulletproof system that Klaus Schwab
[2:12:17.200 --> 2:12:19.200]  and his team can't shut down because it's online.
[2:12:19.200 --> 2:12:20.200]  So go right now.
[2:12:20.200 --> 2:12:22.200]  It's 25% off.
[2:12:22.200 --> 2:12:25.200]  And as a huge fan of Alex for so many years,
[2:12:25.200 --> 2:12:28.200]  I think this is the best thing that he's ever created.
[2:12:28.200 --> 2:12:30.200]  And let's explain.
[2:12:30.200 --> 2:12:32.200]  This is instead of covering the past
[2:12:32.200 --> 2:12:34.200]  and the present and looking at the future,
[2:12:34.200 --> 2:12:36.200]  really looking at how they operate,
[2:12:36.200 --> 2:12:38.200]  how would we quantify with our own definitions
[2:12:38.200 --> 2:12:39.200]  what they're really doing
[2:12:39.200 --> 2:12:41.200]  and cut through their terms in confusion
[2:12:41.200 --> 2:12:43.200]  and really get a super masterclass
[2:12:43.200 --> 2:12:46.200]  on how I've been so successful fighting them.
[2:12:46.200 --> 2:12:47.200]  Because there's one thing to say,
[2:12:47.200 --> 2:12:48.200]  oh, I know the secret.
[2:12:48.200 --> 2:12:49.200]  I believe it happens.
[2:12:49.200 --> 2:12:50.200]  That's not how it works.
[2:12:50.200 --> 2:12:52.200]  There's a bunch of other things that go into it.
[2:12:52.200 --> 2:12:54.200]  And then if you're aligned with God's will,
[2:12:54.200 --> 2:12:55.200]  then it all happens.
[2:12:55.200 --> 2:12:57.200]  I mean, this is super dangerous
[2:12:57.200 --> 2:12:58.200]  weaponry against the enemy.
[2:12:58.200 --> 2:13:00.200]  I cannot express to you that if you get this,
[2:13:00.200 --> 2:13:02.200]  understand this, and then implement this,
[2:13:02.200 --> 2:13:04.200]  it's game changing.
[2:13:04.200 --> 2:13:06.200]  And here's one of the things that I was thinking about
[2:13:06.200 --> 2:13:07.200]  when you were talking a moment ago.
[2:13:07.200 --> 2:13:10.200]  You were mentioning that Klaus Schwab quote
[2:13:10.200 --> 2:13:12.200]  where Schwab's saying,
[2:13:12.200 --> 2:13:14.200]  we must prepare for an angry world.
[2:13:14.200 --> 2:13:15.200]  Right?
[2:13:15.200 --> 2:13:16.200]  What are they doing?
[2:13:16.200 --> 2:13:18.200]  They're literally trying to keep us
[2:13:18.200 --> 2:13:21.200]  in lower emotional ranges.
[2:13:21.200 --> 2:13:22.200]  And you're going to get,
[2:13:22.200 --> 2:13:24.200]  I'll break it down in the next hour,
[2:13:24.200 --> 2:13:25.200]  all types of amazing things.
[2:13:25.200 --> 2:13:26.200]  But one of the terms,
[2:13:26.200 --> 2:13:28.200]  this is Alex like you've never heard him before,
[2:13:28.200 --> 2:13:31.200]  really breaking down step by step,
[2:13:31.200 --> 2:13:33.200]  the enemy's playbook, reverse engineering it,
[2:13:33.200 --> 2:13:35.200]  so that you and I can use it in our life
[2:13:35.200 --> 2:13:37.200]  to protect your family, protect your finances.
[2:13:37.200 --> 2:13:38.200]  And where you were so important,
[2:13:38.200 --> 2:13:40.200]  because you came in and said,
[2:13:40.200 --> 2:13:41.200]  look at this clip, look at that clip,
[2:13:41.200 --> 2:13:42.200]  look at the things you've done.
[2:13:42.200 --> 2:13:43.200]  It was really mided into the course,
[2:13:43.200 --> 2:13:45.200]  but you've done your own very successful courses
[2:13:45.200 --> 2:13:47.200]  with some of the top names out there.
[2:13:47.200 --> 2:13:49.200]  You said, but you need to slow down and codify it
[2:13:49.200 --> 2:13:51.200]  so you help me over really four months,
[2:13:51.200 --> 2:13:52.200]  write this down.
[2:13:52.200 --> 2:13:55.200]  So for the first time ever, I am following a script,
[2:13:55.200 --> 2:13:57.200]  not a teleprompter, but it's a script.
[2:13:57.200 --> 2:13:59.200]  I mean, we actually, this is really an on,
[2:13:59.200 --> 2:14:02.200]  this is a video book, it's a six hour book,
[2:14:02.200 --> 2:14:04.200]  it's a book put to six hours of video.
[2:14:04.200 --> 2:14:06.200]  So it's beyond and on, it's a class.
[2:14:06.200 --> 2:14:08.200]  Yeah, imagine if you were sitting in the room
[2:14:08.200 --> 2:14:10.200]  with Alex right now and he was breaking down
[2:14:10.200 --> 2:14:13.200]  the most important things that, not only-
[2:14:13.200 --> 2:14:14.200]  And you made me slow down,
[2:14:14.200 --> 2:14:15.200]  you were in the room with me saying,
[2:14:15.200 --> 2:14:16.200]  well, let's just-
[2:14:16.200 --> 2:14:18.200]  This is literally going to be Alex
[2:14:18.200 --> 2:14:21.200]  just in his, the way he's communicating
[2:14:21.200 --> 2:14:23.200]  like you've never heard before ever.
[2:14:23.200 --> 2:14:25.200]  You kept saying like we're at dinner
[2:14:25.200 --> 2:14:27.200]  and I'm very calm and very smooth.
[2:14:27.200 --> 2:14:29.200]  You're like, you need to be like that.
[2:14:29.200 --> 2:14:32.200]  That's the, and so part of the video is like that.
[2:14:32.200 --> 2:14:34.200]  They're not going to like this, right?
[2:14:34.200 --> 2:14:35.200]  They want to just keep hitting Alex
[2:14:35.200 --> 2:14:37.200]  with a million lawsuit here a lot
[2:14:37.200 --> 2:14:39.200]  to keep them in a state where there's so much stress.
[2:14:39.200 --> 2:14:41.200]  They don't want something like this out.
[2:14:41.200 --> 2:14:43.200]  You have to go to resetwars.com,
[2:14:43.200 --> 2:14:46.200]  watch the video, sign up right now.
[2:14:46.200 --> 2:14:48.200]  This is only going to be available for a little.
[2:14:48.200 --> 2:14:50.200]  We've already had issues with people
[2:14:50.200 --> 2:14:51.200]  trying to take things down.
[2:14:51.200 --> 2:14:53.200]  Vice News attacked us.
[2:14:53.200 --> 2:14:55.200]  We've had different issues already.
[2:14:55.200 --> 2:14:56.200]  We're not going to tell,
[2:14:56.200 --> 2:14:57.200]  we're not going to say what the issues are,
[2:14:57.200 --> 2:14:58.200]  but it's been massive.
[2:14:58.200 --> 2:14:59.200]  They're really scared of this.
[2:14:59.200 --> 2:15:01.200]  Our only fear is that this,
[2:15:01.200 --> 2:15:02.200]  that the site goes down.
[2:15:02.200 --> 2:15:04.200]  And so go right now, sign up right now,
[2:15:04.200 --> 2:15:06.200]  get this right now.
[2:15:06.200 --> 2:15:08.200]  That's why we're sending you the video.
[2:15:08.200 --> 2:15:09.200]  Yes, you get it.
[2:15:09.200 --> 2:15:10.200]  It's going to be sent out to you.
[2:15:10.200 --> 2:15:12.200]  And I can promise you,
[2:15:12.200 --> 2:15:14.200]  as a massive Alex Jones fan,
[2:15:14.200 --> 2:15:17.200]  this is the best thing you will ever purchase
[2:15:17.200 --> 2:15:19.200]  from Alex in terms of the self-transformation
[2:15:19.200 --> 2:15:20.200]  that occurred.
[2:15:20.200 --> 2:15:22.200]  But I want to hit something you were saying.
[2:15:22.200 --> 2:15:24.200]  This is one of my favorite parts of the course
[2:15:24.200 --> 2:15:25.200]  that you break down,
[2:15:25.200 --> 2:15:26.200]  that starts to make sense
[2:15:26.200 --> 2:15:29.200]  of how this whole control system works.
[2:15:29.200 --> 2:15:30.200]  And I was saying,
[2:15:30.200 --> 2:15:31.200]  you were talking about Klaus Schwab,
[2:15:31.200 --> 2:15:32.200]  and he goes,
[2:15:32.200 --> 2:15:35.200]  we must prepare for angry a world.
[2:15:35.200 --> 2:15:36.200]  And in your course,
[2:15:36.200 --> 2:15:38.200]  you call that the emotional control grid.
[2:15:38.200 --> 2:15:39.200]  Stay there.
[2:15:39.200 --> 2:15:40.200]  We'll come back with the emotional control grid.
[2:15:40.200 --> 2:15:42.200]  Straight ahead, ladies and gentlemen,
[2:15:42.200 --> 2:15:43.200]  how to deep pattern yourself,
[2:15:43.200 --> 2:15:44.200]  how to break the brainwashing,
[2:15:44.200 --> 2:15:46.200]  how to get rid of the bad programs
[2:15:46.200 --> 2:15:47.200]  that Elon Musk,
[2:15:47.200 --> 2:15:48.200]  right after we finished the course
[2:15:48.200 --> 2:15:49.200]  we were talking about.
[2:15:49.200 --> 2:15:51.200]  We'll be right back.
[2:15:51.200 --> 2:15:52.200]  Stay with us.
[2:15:55.200 --> 2:15:56.200]  If you're concerned about the power.
[2:15:56.200 --> 2:15:58.200]  Let's go ahead and take another call.
[2:15:58.200 --> 2:16:00.200]  Let's talk to Malcolm in Tennessee.
[2:16:00.200 --> 2:16:01.200]  Welcome.
[2:16:01.200 --> 2:16:02.200]  Hello, Alex.
[2:16:02.200 --> 2:16:03.200]  Yes, Malcolm.
[2:16:03.200 --> 2:16:04.200]  All right.
[2:16:04.200 --> 2:16:05.200]  I will make this quick and real short
[2:16:05.200 --> 2:16:06.200]  where the other patrons can get on the line.
[2:16:06.200 --> 2:16:08.200]  Alex, I have to promote one thing
[2:16:08.200 --> 2:16:10.200]  from one of your co-hosts,
[2:16:10.200 --> 2:16:11.200]  Owen Schreuer.
[2:16:11.200 --> 2:16:13.200]  Supermail volatility and Brainforce Plus.
[2:16:13.200 --> 2:16:15.200]  Mix those two together.
[2:16:15.200 --> 2:16:16.200]  You're an unstoppable tank.
[2:16:16.200 --> 2:16:18.200]  Supermail volatility really, really works.
[2:16:18.200 --> 2:16:21.200]  It's cold pressed herbs and natural compounds
[2:16:21.200 --> 2:16:23.200]  that have never been heated up.
[2:16:23.200 --> 2:16:26.200]  And so it has a dramatic effect
[2:16:26.200 --> 2:16:28.200]  compared to powdered versions.
[2:16:28.200 --> 2:16:29.200]  They also work quite well,
[2:16:29.200 --> 2:16:30.200]  but just aren't as strong.
[2:16:30.200 --> 2:16:32.200]  This is like a very fine wine.
[2:16:32.200 --> 2:16:34.200]  In fact, each batch is different.
[2:16:34.200 --> 2:16:35.200]  Sometimes it's super strong.
[2:16:35.200 --> 2:16:36.200]  Sometimes it's just okay.
[2:16:36.200 --> 2:16:37.200]  People are like,
[2:16:37.200 --> 2:16:38.200]  why are you selling something
[2:16:38.200 --> 2:16:40.200]  and admitting sometimes the batch isn't strong?
[2:16:40.200 --> 2:16:41.200]  That's just how it is.
[2:16:41.200 --> 2:16:42.200]  It's how it works.
[2:16:42.200 --> 2:16:44.200]  So it's always good.
[2:16:44.200 --> 2:16:46.200]  It's just sometimes it's like super strong.
[2:16:46.200 --> 2:16:48.200]  But yeah, if you want the Rolls Royce
[2:16:48.200 --> 2:17:17.200]  at a decent price, then this is it.
[2:17:18.200 --> 2:17:19.200]  Thanks for watching.
[2:17:19.200 --> 2:17:48.200]  I'll see you next time.
[2:17:49.200 --> 2:17:52.200]  We do expect to sell this new product quickly.
[2:17:52.200 --> 2:18:21.200]  Be sure to secure yours
[2:18:22.200 --> 2:18:23.200]  at www.infowarstore.com.
[2:18:53.200 --> 2:18:55.200]  Your support there keeps us on the air.
[2:18:55.200 --> 2:19:24.200]  I cannot thank you enough.
[2:19:25.200 --> 2:19:51.200]  Thank you.
[2:19:51.200 --> 2:19:58.200]  Thank you.
[2:20:21.200 --> 2:20:28.200]  You won't get what you're after until you visit resetwars.com.
[2:20:28.200 --> 2:20:29.200]  Believe me, folks,
[2:20:29.200 --> 2:20:32.200]  all the left thinks they don't know the answer.
[2:20:32.200 --> 2:20:34.200]  But I'm here to tell you we got it.
[2:20:34.200 --> 2:20:36.200]  We understand the mind, the body, the spirit,
[2:20:36.200 --> 2:20:38.200]  interested in how they're controlling us
[2:20:38.200 --> 2:20:40.200]  with their understanding of this.
[2:20:40.200 --> 2:20:41.200]  But once you're aware of it,
[2:20:41.200 --> 2:20:43.200]  their power is gone.
[2:20:43.200 --> 2:20:45.200]  Now, not knocking the who.
[2:20:45.200 --> 2:20:47.200]  I actually know that the head of the who
[2:20:47.200 --> 2:20:48.200]  is actually a big listener.
[2:20:48.200 --> 2:20:49.200]  I'll just leave it at that.
[2:20:49.200 --> 2:20:51.200]  But look at this tweet that you wanted
[2:20:51.200 --> 2:20:52.200]  to show people right here,
[2:20:52.200 --> 2:20:54.200]  with an overhead shot.
[2:20:54.200 --> 2:20:55.200]  That's Elon Musk,
[2:20:55.200 --> 2:20:56.200]  and that's just a few weeks ago.
[2:20:56.200 --> 2:20:58.200]  He says the overreaching problem
[2:20:58.200 --> 2:21:01.200]  is that we need better mental firewalls
[2:21:01.200 --> 2:21:04.200]  for the information consistently coming at us.
[2:21:04.200 --> 2:21:06.200]  Critical at first,
[2:21:06.200 --> 2:21:09.200]  principles thinking should be required
[2:21:09.200 --> 2:21:11.200]  course in middle school.
[2:21:11.200 --> 2:21:13.200]  Who wrote the software running in your head?
[2:21:13.200 --> 2:21:16.200]  Are you sure you actually want it there?
[2:21:16.200 --> 2:21:17.200]  And that was in a response
[2:21:17.200 --> 2:21:19.200]  to the other person they're saying.
[2:21:19.200 --> 2:21:21.200]  They're using CIA mind control.
[2:21:21.200 --> 2:21:22.200]  They're using programming.
[2:21:22.200 --> 2:21:25.200]  They're creating artificial personalities,
[2:21:25.200 --> 2:21:28.200]  constructs, and Musk responded with that.
[2:21:28.200 --> 2:21:30.200]  And here's the craziest thing about this entire thing,
[2:21:30.200 --> 2:21:33.200]  is I sent this to Alex as soon as it came out,
[2:21:33.200 --> 2:21:37.200]  because the day before I was on air with Alex,
[2:21:37.200 --> 2:21:41.200]  and we did a special on all the declassified documents
[2:21:41.200 --> 2:21:45.200]  and military experiments on mind control,
[2:21:45.200 --> 2:21:49.200]  the entire Reset Wars course is specifically using...
[2:21:49.200 --> 2:21:50.200]  It's about getting,
[2:21:50.200 --> 2:21:51.200]  you say getting that bad,
[2:21:51.200 --> 2:21:53.200]  I say getting the bad software off the brain.
[2:21:53.200 --> 2:21:58.200]  And the firewall word is directly from Richard Cisero,
[2:21:58.200 --> 2:22:01.200]  who was the deputy director of DARPA,
[2:22:01.200 --> 2:22:05.200]  working on hypnosis and microwave control systems
[2:22:05.200 --> 2:22:07.200]  to manipulate brain patterns.
[2:22:07.200 --> 2:22:08.200]  And so because we're exposing it,
[2:22:08.200 --> 2:22:10.200]  we're now the mind controllers.
[2:22:10.200 --> 2:22:11.200]  I love vice.
[2:22:11.200 --> 2:22:13.200]  No, you're doing that, not us.
[2:22:13.200 --> 2:22:16.200]  But the craziest thing about this is I sent it to Alex.
[2:22:16.200 --> 2:22:19.200]  I said, we just talked about this.
[2:22:19.200 --> 2:22:21.200]  He's using these exact words in a tweet.
[2:22:21.200 --> 2:22:23.200]  I think he watches your show.
[2:22:23.200 --> 2:22:26.200]  This is the type of stuff that we're breaking into.
[2:22:26.200 --> 2:22:29.200]  I do know that he watches a show,
[2:22:29.200 --> 2:22:31.200]  but I can't talk about it, but just go ahead.
[2:22:31.200 --> 2:22:33.200]  This is what's going into this.
[2:22:33.200 --> 2:22:36.200]  I mean, this is why this Reset Wars is so important.
[2:22:36.200 --> 2:22:39.200]  This is not just like, hey, go check out this thing.
[2:22:39.200 --> 2:22:44.200]  No, go to resetwars.com, buy this course right now,
[2:22:44.200 --> 2:22:46.200]  and go through it immediately.
[2:22:46.200 --> 2:22:48.200]  This is what they don't want us to do.
[2:22:48.200 --> 2:22:50.200]  They don't want us to put the firewall systems up.
[2:22:50.200 --> 2:22:54.200]  He's going to teach you the exact exercises to start to do this,
[2:22:54.200 --> 2:22:57.200]  how we went from some guy that was 17 years old recording in his closet
[2:22:57.200 --> 2:23:00.200]  becoming one of the most powerful people in America.
[2:23:00.200 --> 2:23:01.200]  How do you do that?
[2:23:01.200 --> 2:23:03.200]  Well, it's not just because he's some guy named Alex.
[2:23:03.200 --> 2:23:05.200]  You and I need to do it too.
[2:23:05.200 --> 2:23:06.200]  And that's how we win.
[2:23:06.200 --> 2:23:07.200]  That's why I'm optimistic.
[2:23:07.200 --> 2:23:11.200]  So this course is teaching you not only to control what you can control,
[2:23:11.200 --> 2:23:13.200]  but protect your family and learn these things
[2:23:13.200 --> 2:23:16.200]  that now Elon's tweeting about right afterwards.
[2:23:16.200 --> 2:23:19.200]  I mean, literally, if people just pick up on 10% of this,
[2:23:19.200 --> 2:23:22.200]  because I know this stuff, but I don't implement it much of the time.
[2:23:22.200 --> 2:23:23.200]  When I do, it's like magic.
[2:23:23.200 --> 2:23:27.200]  The enemy knows this, but they're constantly doing it to keep us controlled
[2:23:27.200 --> 2:23:29.200]  and not enlightened because if we're enlightened,
[2:23:29.200 --> 2:23:31.200]  we would break away from them.
[2:23:31.200 --> 2:23:34.200]  And this ties great into what we were saying before the last break
[2:23:34.200 --> 2:23:37.200]  when you were talking about that Klaus Schwab saying,
[2:23:37.200 --> 2:23:38.200]  prepare for angry world.
[2:23:38.200 --> 2:23:41.200]  And in the course, Alex uses a term that he invented
[2:23:41.200 --> 2:23:45.200]  called the emotional control grid and Klaus is saying,
[2:23:45.200 --> 2:23:46.200]  prepare for angry world.
[2:23:46.200 --> 2:23:49.200]  They want us to be angry because what Alex talks about
[2:23:49.200 --> 2:23:53.200]  is the emotional control grid is the mental and emotional planes
[2:23:53.200 --> 2:23:55.200]  that trap us into this dimension.
[2:23:55.200 --> 2:23:57.200]  It cuts us off from the higher spiritual factors
[2:23:57.200 --> 2:23:59.200]  and it traps us into this dimension.
[2:23:59.200 --> 2:24:02.200]  So the whole goal is to keep us in these emotions
[2:24:02.200 --> 2:24:04.200]  where you know what's happening in the world,
[2:24:04.200 --> 2:24:06.200]  but you're afraid or you're angry.
[2:24:06.200 --> 2:24:10.200]  Alex shows you the exact system, the exercises,
[2:24:10.200 --> 2:24:12.200]  the tricks and techniques that you need to do
[2:24:12.200 --> 2:24:14.200]  to break out of the emotional control grid
[2:24:14.200 --> 2:24:16.200]  to protect your family, to protect your finances.
[2:24:16.200 --> 2:24:17.200]  And I want to be clear.
[2:24:17.200 --> 2:24:21.200]  I'm not on some high horse here pointing my finger at people.
[2:24:21.200 --> 2:24:23.200]  Three more fingers are pointed back at me.
[2:24:23.200 --> 2:24:26.200]  I've been through the fact of anger and which can be used,
[2:24:26.200 --> 2:24:28.200]  but you've got to be in control of it.
[2:24:28.200 --> 2:24:30.200]  And over time, as you get older,
[2:24:30.200 --> 2:24:32.200]  you learn how to not people punch your buttons,
[2:24:32.200 --> 2:24:34.200]  but this is how you transcend it completely
[2:24:34.200 --> 2:24:38.200]  and just get a whole other level of control.
[2:24:38.200 --> 2:24:41.200]  And if you think about it at the core,
[2:24:41.200 --> 2:24:44.200]  that's how they win if this info doesn't get out.
[2:24:44.200 --> 2:24:46.200]  And that's why Elon said in that tweet
[2:24:46.200 --> 2:24:48.200]  that these are the things that have to be taught,
[2:24:48.200 --> 2:24:52.200]  because it's one thing for us to know what's happening in the world.
[2:24:52.200 --> 2:24:55.200]  That's learning it, but it's another for us to be living it.
[2:24:55.200 --> 2:24:57.200]  And in the course you have that section,
[2:24:57.200 --> 2:25:00.200]  you call it the victimhood of the awake.
[2:25:00.200 --> 2:25:03.200]  And you're talking about, hey, you watch our show,
[2:25:03.200 --> 2:25:04.200]  you've seen our documentaries,
[2:25:04.200 --> 2:25:06.200]  you know what's happening in the world,
[2:25:06.200 --> 2:25:09.200]  but you aren't where you want to be financially.
[2:25:09.200 --> 2:25:11.200]  You haven't made the movements in your community
[2:25:11.200 --> 2:25:13.200]  to change the education system,
[2:25:13.200 --> 2:25:15.200]  or you're a doctor and you feel helpless.
[2:25:15.200 --> 2:25:19.200]  Well, you can learn how to tap into the power of your mind
[2:25:19.200 --> 2:25:21.200]  and into the power of the universe
[2:25:21.200 --> 2:25:25.200]  to create the most profitable private practice in your whole city.
[2:25:25.200 --> 2:25:27.200]  These are the things that we have to do.
[2:25:27.200 --> 2:25:29.200]  It's that Buckminster Fuller quote where he says,
[2:25:29.200 --> 2:25:31.200]  in order to change the world, you don't fight the system,
[2:25:31.200 --> 2:25:34.200]  you build a new one to make the old system obsolete.
[2:25:34.200 --> 2:25:37.200]  This is erasing those viruses in the system.
[2:25:37.200 --> 2:25:39.200]  Once we rewrite all of our own operating systems,
[2:25:39.200 --> 2:25:42.200]  we find out we're all just as powerful as Alex.
[2:25:42.200 --> 2:25:43.200]  Heck, maybe even more.
[2:25:43.200 --> 2:25:45.200]  And when we do that, we change the medical system,
[2:25:45.200 --> 2:25:47.200]  we change the education system,
[2:25:47.200 --> 2:25:49.200]  we change the broadcasting system.
[2:25:49.200 --> 2:25:51.200]  And again, the globalists know that,
[2:25:51.200 --> 2:25:53.200]  that's why they want you to be weak and pathetic
[2:25:53.200 --> 2:25:55.200]  and not, not the actual hood, not victory hood,
[2:25:55.200 --> 2:25:57.200]  a term I've coined, that's in this.
[2:25:57.200 --> 2:25:59.200]  And so I'm telling you folks, this is only stuff
[2:25:59.200 --> 2:26:02.200]  that I finally came all together in the last year.
[2:26:02.200 --> 2:26:04.200]  I mean, this is God working through us
[2:26:04.200 --> 2:26:06.200]  and it was God, you know, working through,
[2:26:06.200 --> 2:26:09.200]  Jack Deucey and myself, this is really important.
[2:26:09.200 --> 2:26:11.200]  It's no, what, I mean, it's obvious.
[2:26:11.200 --> 2:26:13.200]  It's no wonder that, that Vice News wrote
[2:26:13.200 --> 2:26:15.200]  a negative review on it before it was even out.
[2:26:15.200 --> 2:26:17.200]  Literally before it was even out.
[2:26:17.200 --> 2:26:19.200]  Because the whole thing here to,
[2:26:19.200 --> 2:26:22.200]  to try to stop infowars is to try to shut down
[2:26:22.200 --> 2:26:24.200]  the supply chain so funding can't come through,
[2:26:24.200 --> 2:26:26.200]  try to hit them with a million lawsuits at one time,
[2:26:26.200 --> 2:26:28.200]  keep them in a, keep them in a state
[2:26:28.200 --> 2:26:30.200]  where there's so much stress going on,
[2:26:30.200 --> 2:26:32.200]  but we've been able to codify and break this all down
[2:26:32.200 --> 2:26:35.200]  in a way like absolutely never before.
[2:26:35.200 --> 2:26:37.200]  And in the emotional control grid,
[2:26:37.200 --> 2:26:39.200]  if we stick on that theme, right,
[2:26:39.200 --> 2:26:41.200]  you talk a lot about trauma-based mind control
[2:26:41.200 --> 2:26:44.200]  and how they're really activating that right now.
[2:26:44.200 --> 2:26:47.200]  And in the course, you talk about
[2:26:47.200 --> 2:26:49.200]  how trauma-based mind control
[2:26:49.200 --> 2:26:51.200]  is a part of your operating system.
[2:26:51.200 --> 2:26:54.200]  You liken the mind to an operating system.
[2:26:54.200 --> 2:26:56.200]  And you talk about how all of us
[2:26:56.200 --> 2:26:58.200]  have our own trauma-based mind control.
[2:26:58.200 --> 2:27:01.200]  Alex actually gets vulnerable, personal,
[2:27:01.200 --> 2:27:05.200]  and he actually breaks down from his own life.
[2:27:05.200 --> 2:27:07.200]  Here are the ways that trauma-based mind control
[2:27:07.200 --> 2:27:08.200]  has controlled me.
[2:27:08.200 --> 2:27:10.200]  Because you may think you know what's going on,
[2:27:10.200 --> 2:27:12.200]  but it's a whole other level when you learn
[2:27:12.200 --> 2:27:14.200]  to actually peel back the engine
[2:27:14.200 --> 2:27:16.200]  to what's actually occurring, right?
[2:27:16.200 --> 2:27:17.200]  Absolutely.
[2:27:17.200 --> 2:27:19.200]  And again, it's an exercise for everybody,
[2:27:19.200 --> 2:27:21.200]  and there's so much. I mean, that's why
[2:27:21.200 --> 2:27:23.200]  I would suggest there's 10 chapters.
[2:27:23.200 --> 2:27:25.200]  I think people should watch a chapter a day.
[2:27:25.200 --> 2:27:27.200]  And you shouldn't do it when a bunch of the kids
[2:27:27.200 --> 2:27:29.200]  are running around and you're busy or you're tired.
[2:27:29.200 --> 2:27:31.200]  You should do this like on Saturday morning, Sunday morning,
[2:27:31.200 --> 2:27:33.200]  or whenever you're relaxed and really fresh.
[2:27:33.200 --> 2:27:35.200]  I think this is something people should watch in the morning,
[2:27:35.200 --> 2:27:37.200]  take notes, and I'm telling you, this is,
[2:27:37.200 --> 2:27:39.200]  of all the self-help stuff out there,
[2:27:39.200 --> 2:27:41.200]  and there's a lot of great stuff I've learned from it,
[2:27:41.200 --> 2:27:43.200]  and things that are out there that are true,
[2:27:43.200 --> 2:27:45.200]  and just being positive and having good energy,
[2:27:45.200 --> 2:27:46.200]  and all that's great.
[2:27:46.200 --> 2:27:48.200]  But this is really how the nuts and bolts work
[2:27:48.200 --> 2:27:50.200]  gets into the spirit, the mind, the body.
[2:27:50.200 --> 2:27:52.200]  That's why it's spirit wars, mind wars.
[2:27:52.200 --> 2:27:54.200]  It's really powerful.
[2:27:54.200 --> 2:27:56.200]  And it makes me optimistic, you know.
[2:27:56.200 --> 2:27:58.200]  Maybe you're watching this right now
[2:27:58.200 --> 2:28:00.200]  and you're overwhelmed, you're stressed,
[2:28:00.200 --> 2:28:02.200]  you're depressed, you're angry about what's happening
[2:28:02.200 --> 2:28:03.200]  in the world.
[2:28:03.200 --> 2:28:05.200]  But I'm really optimistic right now,
[2:28:05.200 --> 2:28:07.200]  especially when you see someone as powerful
[2:28:07.200 --> 2:28:10.200]  as Alex putting out an online training like this.
[2:28:10.200 --> 2:28:12.200]  I'm calling me powerful.
[2:28:12.200 --> 2:28:14.200]  All humans are powerful, and it's a powerful moment.
[2:28:14.200 --> 2:28:16.200]  And also, I want to know, when you go to
[2:28:16.200 --> 2:28:18.200]  resetwars.com, you see the little plug video I did,
[2:28:18.200 --> 2:28:20.200]  that's not the actual course.
[2:28:20.200 --> 2:28:22.200]  The course is like a documentary,
[2:28:22.200 --> 2:28:24.200]  a six-hour plus documentary class.
[2:28:24.200 --> 2:28:25.200]  I mean, it's a film book.
[2:28:25.200 --> 2:28:27.200]  That's the term we use, a film book.
[2:28:27.200 --> 2:28:28.200]  Yeah, it's a film book.
[2:28:28.200 --> 2:28:30.200]  And so, when you go to resetwars.com,

[2:28:57.200 --> 2:29:00.200]  Alex Jones here to make a very important announcement
[2:29:00.200 --> 2:29:02.200]  to our amazing listeners and viewers.
[2:29:02.200 --> 2:29:07.200]  We have produced a limited run of something very, very special.
[2:29:07.200 --> 2:29:11.200]  It's the 1776 Founder Coin.
[2:29:11.200 --> 2:29:13.200]  You've got to see this coin for yourself.
[2:29:13.200 --> 2:29:17.200]  It's at 1776coin.com.
[2:29:17.200 --> 2:29:21.200]  And this coin makes you a founding member
[2:29:21.200 --> 2:29:24.200]  of a very exciting group of projects
[2:29:24.200 --> 2:29:26.200]  that we're going to be launching in the very new future.
[2:29:26.200 --> 2:29:29.200]  Become a founding member today.
[2:29:29.200 --> 2:29:32.200]  Learn more at 1776coin.com
[2:29:32.200 --> 2:29:33.200]  or call toll-free,
[2:29:33.200 --> 2:29:36.200]  triple-eight-two-five-three-three-one-three-nine.
[2:29:36.200 --> 2:29:40.200]  As a founding member, you become part of an elite circle,
[2:29:40.200 --> 2:29:43.200]  continuing the fight against the globalist New World Order.
[2:29:43.200 --> 2:29:46.200]  That's why you're called a founding member.
[2:29:46.200 --> 2:29:48.200]  Because the funding from this is going to go towards
[2:29:48.200 --> 2:29:51.200]  launching these new independent systems
[2:29:51.200 --> 2:29:54.200]  that will empower the American people to take free speech
[2:29:54.200 --> 2:29:57.200]  in the face of censoring tyrants to the next level.
[2:29:57.200 --> 2:30:00.200]  So when I first started taking survival skills,
[2:30:00.200 --> 2:30:02.200]  basically I was 275 pounds overweight.
[2:30:02.200 --> 2:30:04.200]  I had brain fog like you wouldn't believe.
[2:30:04.200 --> 2:30:06.200]  I was barely holding on to a job.
[2:30:06.200 --> 2:30:09.200]  And I heard Dr. Group on your show and I listened to it.
[2:30:09.200 --> 2:30:12.200]  The first one I got was the original survival shield, the X1.
[2:30:12.200 --> 2:30:13.200]  And it worked pretty good.
[2:30:13.200 --> 2:30:15.200]  And then shortly thereafter, you came out with that stew.
[2:30:15.200 --> 2:30:17.200]  You had, you know, with a deep-burdened source, you know,
[2:30:17.200 --> 2:30:19.200]  and I got really excited about that, so I took it.
[2:30:19.200 --> 2:30:22.200]  And man, in two weeks, I went from brain fog
[2:30:22.200 --> 2:30:25.200]  to like literally like my brain was enlightened.
[2:30:25.200 --> 2:30:27.200]  You know, I could think again.
[2:30:27.200 --> 2:30:29.200]  I could connect with people again.
[2:30:29.200 --> 2:30:31.200]  And over the course of the next couple of years,
[2:30:31.200 --> 2:30:34.200]  I got my health back and I religiously took basically
[2:30:34.200 --> 2:30:35.200]  all of your supplements.
[2:30:35.200 --> 2:30:37.200]  They're all absolutely amazing supplements.
[2:30:37.200 --> 2:30:40.200]  The one I like recently is knockout literally.
[2:30:40.200 --> 2:30:42.200]  Like if you want to sleep, just take it.
[2:30:42.200 --> 2:30:43.200]  It's amazing. It works.
[2:30:43.200 --> 2:30:46.200]  But anyway, so the point is we have to get ourselves clean.
[2:30:46.200 --> 2:30:48.200]  We have to break free of the globalist system.
[2:30:48.200 --> 2:30:51.200]  And the only way to do that is to take our own health
[2:30:51.200 --> 2:30:52.200]  into our own hands.
[2:30:52.200 --> 2:30:53.200]  Beautifully said, brother.
[2:30:53.200 --> 2:31:18.200]  I thank you so much for your call at Godspeed.
[2:31:23.200 --> 2:31:45.200]  Thank you.
[2:31:45.200 --> 2:32:11.200]  Thank you.
[2:32:11.200 --> 2:32:15.200]  And now to get around big tech, it's more important than ever
[2:32:15.200 --> 2:32:17.200]  that we use every tool we've got.
[2:32:17.200 --> 2:32:20.200]  Well, ladies and gentlemen, if you sign up for our free news

[2:32:59.200 --> 2:33:14.200]  Get a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[2:33:14.200 --> 2:33:30.200]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[2:33:30.200 --> 2:33:57.200]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[2:33:57.200 --> 2:34:01.200]  That's why you can go back 20 months ago, 22 months ago.
[2:34:01.200 --> 2:34:03.200]  You can go back to February of last year and I said,
[2:34:03.200 --> 2:34:05.200]  this isn't a vaccine.
[2:34:05.200 --> 2:34:08.200]  It's a gene therapy that will erase your immune system.
[2:34:08.200 --> 2:34:10.200]  Then they'll claim you've got to have shots every few months
[2:34:10.200 --> 2:34:13.200]  and it just basically is going to kill you.
[2:34:13.200 --> 2:34:15.200]  Israel is now announcing seven shots.
[2:34:15.200 --> 2:34:17.200]  Europe announcing five shots.
[2:34:17.200 --> 2:34:19.200]  And then as they move across the Atlantic,
[2:34:19.200 --> 2:34:25.200]  double jab will no longer be unvax.
[2:34:25.200 --> 2:34:29.200]  Double jab will be unvaxed by February.
[2:34:29.200 --> 2:34:33.200]  UK says booster is required for vaccine passports.
[2:34:33.200 --> 2:34:36.200]  And they're announcing you can't have hotels or cars or planes.
[2:34:36.200 --> 2:34:39.200]  And then it's third shots, fourth shots, fifth shots.
[2:34:39.200 --> 2:34:41.200]  This is so diabolical.
[2:34:41.200 --> 2:34:49.200]  It's an exercise of total and complete mission.
[2:34:49.200 --> 2:34:52.200]  And we've got Rupert Murdoch, the latest rich billionaire
[2:34:52.200 --> 2:34:55.200]  in the United States.
[2:34:55.200 --> 2:34:58.200]  They're going to occupy a remote area in the middle of nowhere,
[2:34:58.200 --> 2:35:01.200]  340,000 acres in Montana.
[2:35:01.200 --> 2:35:04.200]  They're all racing out of the cities that are designed to be collapsed.
[2:35:04.200 --> 2:35:07.200]  They're all moving back to a safe distance.
[2:35:07.200 --> 2:35:10.200]  So that's where we are, ladies and gentlemen.
[2:35:10.200 --> 2:35:12.200]  We're talking about reset wars, though.
[2:35:12.200 --> 2:35:14.200]  What can you do about the supply chain?
[2:35:14.200 --> 2:35:16.200]  What can you do about the open borders?
[2:35:16.200 --> 2:35:18.200]  All that you can change your mind.
[2:35:18.200 --> 2:35:20.200]  The most important asset you've got is your soul
[2:35:20.200 --> 2:35:22.200]  and your mind is the interface with this convention.
[2:35:22.200 --> 2:35:24.200]  We explain it all.
[2:35:24.200 --> 2:35:27.200]  How the globalists are programming you in reset wars.
[2:35:27.200 --> 2:35:29.200]  Jake Ducey, please continue.
[2:35:29.200 --> 2:35:32.200]  Yeah, I mean, imagine if all of this happens
[2:35:32.200 --> 2:35:35.200]  and we have this massive cyber attack or economic collapse
[2:35:35.200 --> 2:35:38.200]  and you aren't spiritually or mentally prepared.
[2:35:38.200 --> 2:35:40.200]  And that's what reset wars is about.
[2:35:40.200 --> 2:35:43.200]  And, you know, I was thinking when we were at break,
[2:35:43.200 --> 2:35:48.200]  it was funny because vice news attacked reset wars
[2:35:48.200 --> 2:35:51.200]  and, you know, also attacked me.
[2:35:51.200 --> 2:35:53.200]  And they don't want this stuff getting out, right?
[2:35:53.200 --> 2:35:55.200]  But it made me start thinking about it a little more
[2:35:55.200 --> 2:35:58.200]  because the way they spun the article is they tried to spin it
[2:35:58.200 --> 2:36:03.200]  as if hypnosis and mind control is some, like, new age thing.
[2:36:03.200 --> 2:36:06.200]  Obviously, it's probably a project mockingbird type of thing.
[2:36:06.200 --> 2:36:08.200]  Yeah, guys, pull that up. The latter days of Alex shows.
[2:36:08.200 --> 2:36:10.200]  No, it's the latter day for everybody.
[2:36:10.200 --> 2:36:13.200]  Yeah, I guess we're bigger than ever.
[2:36:13.200 --> 2:36:16.200]  But I guess, yeah, it is the latter days for all of us.
[2:36:16.200 --> 2:36:18.200]  But here's the funny thing about that, Alex.
[2:36:18.200 --> 2:36:23.200]  So I wrote down mind control and hypnosis are practical science,
[2:36:23.200 --> 2:36:26.200]  not just from these thousands of declassified documents
[2:36:26.200 --> 2:36:29.200]  and Alex breaks down how to use it and reprogram your mind.
[2:36:29.200 --> 2:36:31.200]  But there's also a term in neuroscience.
[2:36:31.200 --> 2:36:34.200]  It's called Hebb's Law. It's a term from neuroplasticity.
[2:36:34.200 --> 2:36:38.200]  And Hebb's Law says that nerve cells that fire together wire together.
[2:36:38.200 --> 2:36:41.200]  So every time we have an emotion, we see panic.
[2:36:41.200 --> 2:36:43.200]  Klaus Schwab says, be angry.
[2:36:43.200 --> 2:36:46.200]  All of these things, we fire cells in our brain.
[2:36:46.200 --> 2:36:48.200]  And there's a term in neuroscience called Hebb's Law
[2:36:48.200 --> 2:36:51.200]  that says that brain cells that fire together wire together.
[2:36:51.200 --> 2:36:54.200]  So we build these neural networks that fire and wire together.
[2:36:54.200 --> 2:36:59.200]  So neurologically, all of the psychological warfare,
[2:36:59.200 --> 2:37:03.200]  all the emotional trauma, Alex calls it the emotional control grid,
[2:37:03.200 --> 2:37:05.200]  all of these things that are happening,
[2:37:05.200 --> 2:37:07.200]  even though you think you know what's going on,
[2:37:07.200 --> 2:37:10.200]  even though I think I know what's going on, subconsciously,
[2:37:10.200 --> 2:37:13.200]  it actually gets into the neurological circuitry of our brain
[2:37:13.200 --> 2:37:15.200]  and our brain gets wired.
[2:37:15.200 --> 2:37:17.200]  And we get wired to stay in debt servitude.
[2:37:17.200 --> 2:37:20.200]  We get wired out of very low emotional spectrum,
[2:37:20.200 --> 2:37:22.200]  so we stay in a state of depression,
[2:37:22.200 --> 2:37:24.200]  or stay in a state of helplessness,
[2:37:24.200 --> 2:37:26.200]  or stay in a state where we think,
[2:37:26.200 --> 2:37:29.200]  well, if I could just be as rich and powerful as Elon,
[2:37:29.200 --> 2:37:30.200]  then I'd change it.
[2:37:30.200 --> 2:37:32.200]  Well, we can break out of all that
[2:37:32.200 --> 2:37:35.200]  and actually raise the ceilings on our entire life.
[2:37:35.200 --> 2:37:37.200]  And so when I was reading that Vice article,
[2:37:37.200 --> 2:37:39.200]  I was laughing, Alex, because I was like,
[2:37:39.200 --> 2:37:42.200]  they're spinning mind control and hypnosis
[2:37:42.200 --> 2:37:46.200]  as if it's New Age when there's 10,000 declassified documents
[2:37:46.200 --> 2:37:47.200]  that we talked about.
[2:37:47.200 --> 2:37:50.200]  When their whole system is obsessed with that,
[2:37:50.200 --> 2:37:51.200]  and we're not hypnotizing people,
[2:37:51.200 --> 2:37:52.200]  we're doing the opposite,
[2:37:52.200 --> 2:37:55.200]  showing them how to get out of the hypnotic trance they put them in.
[2:37:55.200 --> 2:37:58.200]  Yeah, imagine if we all break out of the hypnotic trance.
[2:37:58.200 --> 2:37:59.200]  So whatever you do,
[2:37:59.200 --> 2:38:01.200]  whether you want to be a broadcaster like Alex,
[2:38:01.200 --> 2:38:03.200]  and right now you're getting 100 views,
[2:38:03.200 --> 2:38:05.200]  but you want to be getting a million,
[2:38:05.200 --> 2:38:07.200]  it's just psychological.
[2:38:07.200 --> 2:38:09.200]  There's viruses in your operating system,
[2:38:09.200 --> 2:38:11.200]  whether you're a doctor, whether you're a nurse,
[2:38:11.200 --> 2:38:14.200]  and you're feeling disgruntled by the system.
[2:38:14.200 --> 2:38:16.200]  You can erase subconscious viruses.
[2:38:16.200 --> 2:38:20.200]  Alex breaks down the exercises and the systems to do that
[2:38:20.200 --> 2:38:24.200]  so that you can build one of the most powerful private practices out there.
[2:38:24.200 --> 2:38:25.200]  You can do the same thing.
[2:38:25.200 --> 2:38:28.200]  You can become the biggest real estate agent salesperson in your city,
[2:38:28.200 --> 2:38:31.200]  use all of that money to build a new education system,
[2:38:31.200 --> 2:38:33.200]  or whatever matters to you.
[2:38:33.200 --> 2:38:35.200]  Now, let's just explain.
[2:38:35.200 --> 2:38:38.200]  They create victimology, and maybe people feel pathetic,
[2:38:38.200 --> 2:38:40.200]  and make them think they can't ever do anything,
[2:38:40.200 --> 2:38:42.200]  and create an artificial construct,
[2:38:42.200 --> 2:38:47.200]  even in the CIA documents we show it in the course.
[2:38:47.200 --> 2:38:48.200]  We're doing the opposite.
[2:38:48.200 --> 2:38:51.200]  We're saying the real you with the programming God gave you,
[2:38:51.200 --> 2:38:53.200]  and how to access that, not through us.
[2:38:53.200 --> 2:38:54.200]  We're not the priest class.
[2:38:54.200 --> 2:38:56.200]  As Christ said 2,000 years ago,
[2:38:56.200 --> 2:38:58.200]  no more priests, God comes to you.
[2:38:58.200 --> 2:39:01.200]  This is how to get the damn out of the way to open that up
[2:39:01.200 --> 2:39:03.200]  that you can only do through free will.
[2:39:03.200 --> 2:39:05.200]  Thank you, folks. This is so hardcore.
[2:39:05.200 --> 2:39:08.200]  In the course, you call it fake identity,
[2:39:08.200 --> 2:39:13.200]  but the whole way this system works is us believing that fake identity.
[2:39:13.200 --> 2:39:14.200]  We believe we're powerless.
[2:39:14.200 --> 2:39:15.200]  We believe we're trapped.
[2:39:15.200 --> 2:39:17.200]  We believe that we can't beat them.
[2:39:17.200 --> 2:39:18.200]  They're so powerful.
[2:39:18.200 --> 2:39:20.200]  They're pushing through the great reset,
[2:39:20.200 --> 2:39:22.200]  and it's just going to happen, and we're all screwed.
[2:39:22.200 --> 2:39:24.200]  No, that's what they want us to think.
[2:39:24.200 --> 2:39:26.200]  That's what the emotional control system is about.
[2:39:26.200 --> 2:39:28.200]  And so, while we're up here,
[2:39:28.200 --> 2:39:32.200]  and I'm saying, hey, go to resetwars.com,
[2:39:32.200 --> 2:39:34.200]  watch the video, click the button,
[2:39:34.200 --> 2:39:36.200]  and sign up for this right now.
[2:39:36.200 --> 2:39:38.200]  It's a 25% discount right now.
[2:39:38.200 --> 2:39:40.200]  This is one of the bulletproof ways
[2:39:40.200 --> 2:39:42.200]  to support the InfoWars operation
[2:39:42.200 --> 2:39:44.200]  because they can't shut the supply chains down.
[2:39:44.200 --> 2:39:46.200]  But when I'm telling you this,
[2:39:46.200 --> 2:39:49.200]  I'm telling you as this as someone who's watched pretty much every film,
[2:39:49.200 --> 2:39:52.200]  every show Alex has done for a decade.
[2:39:52.200 --> 2:39:55.200]  This is the most powerful information you will get.
[2:39:55.200 --> 2:39:58.200]  I told him, I said, this is the thing where people are going to walk up to you
[2:39:58.200 --> 2:40:01.200]  and you're going to say, you literally just changed my life.
[2:40:01.200 --> 2:40:03.200]  You literally just changed my life, Alex.
[2:40:03.200 --> 2:40:05.200]  And I told you that a bunch.
[2:40:05.200 --> 2:40:08.200]  I've said this is the thing that is going to do that.
[2:40:08.200 --> 2:40:10.200]  And this is the next level.
[2:40:10.200 --> 2:40:13.200]  I said it's like, InfoWars is tomorrow's news today
[2:40:13.200 --> 2:40:16.200]  and this is applying tomorrow's wisdom today.
[2:40:16.200 --> 2:40:18.200]  Absolutely, and if you look at it,
[2:40:18.200 --> 2:40:20.200]  resetwars were in a reset war with the globalists
[2:40:20.200 --> 2:40:22.200]  trying to keep us in the old corrupt system.
[2:40:22.200 --> 2:40:24.200]  They're claiming they're the future.
[2:40:24.200 --> 2:40:27.200]  It's the opposite, but this is about resetting ourselves.
[2:40:27.200 --> 2:40:29.200]  Yeah, exactly.
[2:40:29.200 --> 2:40:34.200]  With the psychological operation is all about basically bombarding us
[2:40:34.200 --> 2:40:37.200]  with so much stuff happening at once
[2:40:37.200 --> 2:40:42.200]  that we are in a fight-or-flight state
[2:40:42.200 --> 2:40:45.200]  so that we are unprepared when things happen.
[2:40:45.200 --> 2:40:48.200]  We're unprepared when they have a cyber attack.
[2:40:48.200 --> 2:40:53.200]  I mean, imagine if you were able to decode and rewrite your operating system
[2:40:53.200 --> 2:40:55.200]  and get yourself 10 steps ahead financially.
[2:40:55.200 --> 2:40:58.200]  And not be a victim to think of it all as like a fun video game.
[2:40:58.200 --> 2:41:01.200]  They want you playing video games, doing things that aren't real,
[2:41:01.200 --> 2:41:04.200]  but this can actually train you to be positive in the real world
[2:41:04.200 --> 2:41:07.200]  and actually enjoy all the stress that comes with it.
[2:41:07.200 --> 2:41:09.200]  Yeah, because it's like, why are we here?
[2:41:09.200 --> 2:41:14.200]  Ultimately, we're here for self-realization to wake up in our connection to God.
[2:41:14.200 --> 2:41:17.200]  You chose to be here for some reason.
[2:41:17.200 --> 2:41:20.200]  So imagine what would happen if when a cyber attack happens
[2:41:20.200 --> 2:41:22.200]  that shuts down the financial system,
[2:41:22.200 --> 2:41:25.200]  your family's prepared because you got 10 steps ahead financially.
[2:41:25.200 --> 2:41:29.200]  And you're telling your neighbors it's coming because they're already pre-programming.
[2:41:29.200 --> 2:41:30.200]  It's coming.
[2:41:30.200 --> 2:41:32.200]  I mean, unless we have a big enough awakening that they're going to be behind it,
[2:41:32.200 --> 2:41:34.200]  they're going to do it the next 300 days.
[2:41:34.200 --> 2:41:36.200]  And that's why I'm so excited about this,
[2:41:36.200 --> 2:41:38.200]  because it all comes down to awakening.
[2:41:38.200 --> 2:41:41.200]  It doesn't come down to us standing on the corner with signs.
[2:41:41.200 --> 2:41:43.200]  It comes down to us awakening.
[2:41:43.200 --> 2:41:45.200]  If you want to win this battle,
[2:41:45.200 --> 2:41:49.200]  what they're most afraid of is us waking up.
[2:41:49.200 --> 2:41:52.200]  The best way you can do that is to join reset wars,
[2:41:52.200 --> 2:41:55.200]  go through the course, move through these exercises.
[2:41:55.200 --> 2:41:58.200]  Your life will be changed, your finances will be changed,
[2:41:58.200 --> 2:42:01.200]  your family will be prepared for everything that's happened.
[2:42:01.200 --> 2:42:04.200]  And more importantly, you can start to be, as Christ said,
[2:42:04.200 --> 2:42:07.200]  in this world but not of it.
[2:42:07.200 --> 2:42:10.200]  In this world is when they trap us in the emotional control grid, right?
[2:42:10.200 --> 2:42:12.200]  But when we're not of this world,
[2:42:12.200 --> 2:42:15.200]  that's when we tap into this higher creative power.
[2:42:15.200 --> 2:42:19.200]  Because this is all, again, just something that is perceptual.
[2:42:19.200 --> 2:42:22.200]  Now they want to take us even out of the third dimension into the metaverse
[2:42:22.200 --> 2:42:24.200]  and we get into that in the course as well.
[2:42:24.200 --> 2:42:26.200]  Folks, the metaverse is your, quote,
[2:42:26.200 --> 2:42:28.200]  prison that they're trying to put you in.
[2:42:28.200 --> 2:42:30.200]  You want to learn about it? It's in reset wars.
[2:42:30.200 --> 2:42:34.200]  So what's funny, too, is it's not just the metaverse?
[2:42:34.200 --> 2:42:36.200]  Hold on, you're about to host the fourth hour.
[2:42:36.200 --> 2:42:38.200]  We've got one more segment with you, though, co-hosting.
[2:42:38.200 --> 2:42:40.200]  They're going to tell you it's coming up,
[2:42:40.200 --> 2:42:42.200]  but we're going to talk about that when we come back.
[2:42:42.200 --> 2:42:44.200]  What were you about to say?
[2:42:44.200 --> 2:42:46.200]  I was about to say it's funny they say that they talk about the metaverse,
[2:42:46.200 --> 2:42:48.200]  but we're already in their metaverse.
[2:42:48.200 --> 2:42:51.200]  That you go to resetwars.com, sign up right now,
[2:42:51.200 --> 2:42:54.200]  and learn the operating system to break out of their metaverse.
[2:42:54.200 --> 2:43:23.200]  All right, stay there. Stay there.
[2:43:24.200 --> 2:43:26.200]  Thank you all for your past support.
[2:43:26.200 --> 2:43:28.200]  I want to encourage you now to not wait,
[2:43:28.200 --> 2:43:31.200]  do not procrastinate, and to go to 1776coin.com.
[2:43:31.200 --> 2:43:34.200]  I would imagine that we will sell out of this limited run
[2:43:34.200 --> 2:43:38.200]  of 10,000 coins in only a few weeks, maybe a few days.

[2:43:51.200 --> 2:43:55.200]  I would imagine that we will sell out of this limited run of 10,000
[2:43:55.200 --> 2:43:57.200]  coins in only a few weeks, maybe a few days.
[2:43:57.200 --> 2:43:59.200]  So secure your coin now at 1776coin.com.
[2:43:59.200 --> 2:44:01.200]  Why do my enemies hate me so much?
[2:44:01.200 --> 2:44:03.200]  Why do the globalists hate you so much?
[2:44:03.200 --> 2:44:05.200]  Why do they hate America so much?
[2:44:05.200 --> 2:44:09.200]  Because it's an idea of freedom that their tyrannical system
[2:44:09.200 --> 2:44:12.200]  that they're pushing cannot coexist with.
[2:44:12.200 --> 2:44:14.200]  It's very, very simple.
[2:44:14.200 --> 2:44:16.200]  For their world government, their anti-human,
[2:44:16.200 --> 2:44:19.200]  post-human, eugenics system to flourish,
[2:44:19.200 --> 2:44:24.200]  new process, injustice, and God-fearing systems must fail.
[2:44:24.200 --> 2:44:27.200]  So sure, you didn't start a fight with Bill Gates.
[2:44:27.200 --> 2:44:30.200]  You didn't start a fight with David Rockefeller.
[2:44:30.200 --> 2:44:32.200]  You didn't start a fight with the UN.
[2:44:32.200 --> 2:44:35.200]  They started a fight with you.
[2:44:35.200 --> 2:44:38.200]  And they're not going to back down, and they're not going to go away,
[2:44:38.200 --> 2:44:41.200]  and they're not going to ever stop their attacks
[2:44:41.200 --> 2:44:44.200]  until they have the fear of God put into them.
[2:44:44.200 --> 2:44:47.200]  The average person still doesn't even know about the New World Order
[2:44:47.200 --> 2:44:50.200]  and about globalism or about corporate fascism.
[2:44:50.200 --> 2:44:52.200]  And it's not until people understand that
[2:44:52.200 --> 2:45:18.200]  we're under attack that we have any chance of beating these people.
[2:45:22.200 --> 2:45:26.200]  Protecting your photos, protecting everything that's on your phone is paramount.
[2:45:26.200 --> 2:45:29.200]  That's why everybody should visit InfowarsStore.com.
[2:45:29.200 --> 2:45:32.200]  We're carrying a huge new line of very compliant,
[2:45:32.200 --> 2:45:38.200]  made-in-America products that have 100% reviews and are simply incredible.
[2:45:38.200 --> 2:45:41.200]  It's a 360 win. Protect your privacy and shop at Infowars
[2:45:41.200 --> 2:45:46.200]  to support the overall Infowar against the globalists a true 360 win.

[2:45:49.200 --> 2:45:55.200]  Check out the new line. It's amazing.
[2:45:55.200 --> 2:46:00.200]  In late August, Infowars saw an explosion of orders
[2:46:00.200 --> 2:46:05.200]  because our audience understands that the globalists are destabilizing the planet
[2:46:05.200 --> 2:46:12.200]  by design and are attempting to cause an economic and financial collapse worldwide.
[2:46:12.200 --> 2:46:13.200]  Now, ladies and gentlemen,
[2:46:13.200 --> 2:46:15.200]  storable food has always been something that's important to have.
[2:46:15.200 --> 2:46:20.200]  It's a check box that everybody needs to have, taking care of, right along with water filtration,
[2:46:20.200 --> 2:46:23.200]  self-defense, and a relationship with God.
[2:46:23.200 --> 2:46:26.200]  But now, more than ever, you need to get your storable food orders in.
[2:46:26.200 --> 2:46:29.200]  Now, we're ready to ship to you within 24 hours of your order.
[2:46:29.200 --> 2:46:33.200]  It's high quality. It's very, very low cost at InfowarsStore.com
[2:46:33.200 --> 2:46:37.200]  because in the future, you're going to see more food supply shortages
[2:46:37.200 --> 2:46:41.200]  and you're going to see food supply price increases that are already taking place.
[2:46:41.200 --> 2:46:47.200]  So lock in your storable food now at a lower price and fund the InfowarsStore.com.
[2:46:47.200 --> 2:46:52.200]  That's how you fight the great reset is by being self-sufficient and not under their control.
[2:46:52.200 --> 2:47:21.200]  So get prepared now at InfowarsStore.com.
[2:47:21.200 --> 2:47:27.200]  Now, if you want to understand reset wars,
[2:47:27.200 --> 2:47:29.200]  we could go to any behavioral psychologist manual.
[2:47:29.200 --> 2:47:31.200]  We could go to MK Oldford documents.
[2:47:31.200 --> 2:47:35.200]  We could go to pop psychology or more internal corporate psychology,
[2:47:35.200 --> 2:47:38.200]  which is just a name for a system of control in the human mind that they developed.
[2:47:38.200 --> 2:47:40.200]  They didn't invent the humans. They didn't invent the human mind.
[2:47:40.200 --> 2:47:44.200]  They just created their definitions for it so they could claim they owned it.
[2:47:44.200 --> 2:47:47.200]  Remember, it's 10 years ago. It's gotten a lot crazier since.
[2:47:47.200 --> 2:47:53.200]  The city of Seattle banned the term that a bunch of other cities did, brown bag it.
[2:47:53.200 --> 2:47:57.200]  Because they'd be having a corporate meeting or a city meeting or an event and saying,
[2:47:57.200 --> 2:48:00.200]  hey, brown bag it, no food will be available there.
[2:48:00.200 --> 2:48:04.200]  Well, a brown bag is just what you buy that mom sends you to school with.
[2:48:04.200 --> 2:48:07.200]  But the idea that a brown bag is somehow putting black people down.
[2:48:07.200 --> 2:48:10.200]  That's making the regular world like you're a mental patient.
[2:48:10.200 --> 2:48:13.200]  If you hear the word brown, it's bad.
[2:48:13.200 --> 2:48:18.200]  That's taking an outside issue and then making it negative
[2:48:18.200 --> 2:48:22.200]  so that when you're going through the universe, you're freaking out over things that don't even make sense.
[2:48:22.200 --> 2:48:27.200]  They're laying landmines out there to get you obsessed with these outside constructs
[2:48:27.200 --> 2:48:29.200]  that they put there to program you.
[2:48:29.200 --> 2:48:33.200]  And this is about becoming aware of that at an even higher level.
[2:48:33.200 --> 2:48:36.200]  I mean, you've got to see the course. That's why we're so excited about it.
[2:48:36.200 --> 2:48:39.200]  And I want to thank everybody that is getting the course.
[2:48:39.200 --> 2:48:41.200]  I want to thank everybody that has been keeping us on air
[2:48:41.200 --> 2:48:46.200]  because this will also fund the operation to launch a whole bunch of really important new things
[2:48:46.200 --> 2:48:50.200]  in outreach to the general public because the world is ready for the truth now.
[2:48:50.200 --> 2:48:52.200]  And we can talk about what the globalists are doing and how evil they are,
[2:48:52.200 --> 2:48:57.200]  but how about how they're controlling people and controlling people and putting them in trances
[2:48:57.200 --> 2:49:01.200]  and locking people into the trauma-based mind control?
[2:49:01.200 --> 2:49:03.200]  Because that's abusive to children.
[2:49:03.200 --> 2:49:06.200]  They've got to wear a mask and they're poisonous and they've got viruses.
[2:49:06.200 --> 2:49:09.200]  It's abusive to say you can't say brown paper bag or you're racist.
[2:49:09.200 --> 2:49:12.200]  It's very abusive to tell white children you're inherently bad because you're white.
[2:49:12.200 --> 2:49:15.200]  Or to tell black children they're bad because they've got black skin or brown skin.
[2:49:15.200 --> 2:49:17.200]  That's all trauma-based mind control.
[2:49:17.200 --> 2:49:21.200]  So the controllers are there creating the construct of you're bad
[2:49:21.200 --> 2:49:23.200]  so they can address that new thing that isn't you.
[2:49:23.200 --> 2:49:29.200]  And this is about rejecting that from a scientific level that matches with the spirit wars as well.
[2:49:29.200 --> 2:49:31.200]  So we look at both. It's two courses.
[2:49:31.200 --> 2:49:34.200]  Spirit wars, mind wars, and how the two integrate.
[2:49:34.200 --> 2:49:35.200]  Jake Ducey.
[2:49:35.200 --> 2:49:38.200]  Yep. So that's resetwars.com.
[2:49:38.200 --> 2:49:43.200]  You can head over there right now and sign up 25% off for a limited period of time.
[2:49:43.200 --> 2:49:46.200]  And one of the things that makes me so excited about what's happening right now
[2:49:46.200 --> 2:49:50.200]  is because, yeah, we look at all of these very bad things occurring,
[2:49:50.200 --> 2:49:57.200]  but the reason resetwars is just a, it's a sign of a new renaissance happening.
[2:49:57.200 --> 2:50:00.200]  And that's why they're putting the clamps down so hard right now.
[2:50:00.200 --> 2:50:02.200]  It is a sign of a new renaissance.
[2:50:02.200 --> 2:50:05.200]  It is a sign of this great awakening that's beginning to occur
[2:50:05.200 --> 2:50:08.200]  because whether it's trauma-based mind control in children,
[2:50:08.200 --> 2:50:11.200]  whether it's trauma that you and I inherited when throughout childhood
[2:50:11.200 --> 2:50:14.200]  or in recent years from all the crazy stuff happening in the world,
[2:50:14.200 --> 2:50:18.200]  we know through neuroplasticity, we know through modern psychology,
[2:50:18.200 --> 2:50:21.200]  all of this can be rewired and reprogrammed.
[2:50:21.200 --> 2:50:27.200]  And Alex breaks down the exact system and the exact process to start to do that, right?
[2:50:27.200 --> 2:50:30.200]  Because once we move away and we go within ourselves
[2:50:30.200 --> 2:50:34.200]  and we start finding those viruses, updating the operating systems,
[2:50:34.200 --> 2:50:35.200]  that's how they lose.
[2:50:35.200 --> 2:50:39.200]  Because how many of you have ever actually gone and read a couple thousand pages of MKUltra?
[2:50:39.200 --> 2:50:40.200]  We did.
[2:50:40.200 --> 2:50:44.200]  It's great. Some of the stuff in MKUltra, it ties back into everything.
[2:50:44.200 --> 2:50:46.200]  They use a term called de-patterning.
[2:50:46.200 --> 2:50:48.200]  Fits in perfectly what we're talking about. Alex breaks down.
[2:50:48.200 --> 2:50:53.200]  They call it de-patterning because they're trying to erase people's entire identities.
[2:50:53.200 --> 2:50:57.200]  You're given a code by God, an operating system, an owner's manual
[2:50:57.200 --> 2:50:59.200]  that your spirit sits in and controls.
[2:50:59.200 --> 2:51:02.200]  They're always attacking that, destroying it and trying to block it off
[2:51:02.200 --> 2:51:05.200]  and build the new control panel they control making you a slave.
[2:51:05.200 --> 2:51:07.200]  But they can never really destroy that panel.
[2:51:07.200 --> 2:51:10.200]  You can reboot and reupload that original panel.
[2:51:10.200 --> 2:51:12.200]  And that's what it's all about.
[2:51:12.200 --> 2:51:14.200]  Show them the patterning document.
[2:51:14.200 --> 2:51:17.200]  So look at that right there on your screen that you're seeing right now.
[2:51:17.200 --> 2:51:21.200]  If you go to the very last paragraph, the third to last line right there,
[2:51:21.200 --> 2:51:22.200]  it says the word de-patterning.
[2:51:22.200 --> 2:51:25.200]  So this woman, they have her on a bunch of drugs
[2:51:25.200 --> 2:51:28.200]  and they're erasing her mind, hitting her with all these microwaves
[2:51:28.200 --> 2:51:30.200]  and subliminal program systems.
[2:51:30.200 --> 2:51:34.200]  Probably in her second stage of de-programming and...
[2:51:34.200 --> 2:51:35.200]  De-patterning.
[2:51:35.200 --> 2:51:36.200]  De-patterning, I'm sorry.
[2:51:36.200 --> 2:51:39.200]  And here's what we need to realize.
[2:51:39.200 --> 2:51:43.200]  All of the world is a massive MK Ultra experiment.
[2:51:43.200 --> 2:51:47.200]  You, me, we are MK Ultra experiment patients.
[2:51:47.200 --> 2:51:51.200]  They admitted that this was in the 50s and 60s that had an MK Ultra Dr. Cameron here.
[2:51:51.200 --> 2:51:54.200]  They've now externalized it against all of us through the culture.
[2:51:54.200 --> 2:51:56.200]  Yes, so we've all been patterned.
[2:51:56.200 --> 2:51:59.200]  And so the question goes back to Elon is who wrote your software?
[2:51:59.200 --> 2:52:02.200]  If we're going to win, you have to rewrite your software.
[2:52:02.200 --> 2:52:04.200]  We have to do this together.
[2:52:04.200 --> 2:52:05.200]  We're all in this together.
[2:52:05.200 --> 2:52:07.200]  You have to rewrite your operating system.
[2:52:07.200 --> 2:52:08.200]  I have to.
[2:52:08.200 --> 2:52:11.200]  And that's what the reset course is all about.
[2:52:11.200 --> 2:52:14.200]  So go to resetwars.com, sign up right now.
[2:52:14.200 --> 2:52:15.200]  And let's be clear.
[2:52:15.200 --> 2:52:20.200]  I was speaking because I was thinking we were doing two days of pre-sales.
[2:52:20.200 --> 2:52:22.200]  But because I got behind, we added more.
[2:52:22.200 --> 2:52:23.200]  It's dropping today.
[2:52:23.200 --> 2:52:25.200]  It's now being sent out for everybody that signs up.
[2:52:25.200 --> 2:52:30.200]  You've just got until Wednesday morning to get the 25% off.
[2:52:30.200 --> 2:52:31.200]  Exactly.
[2:52:31.200 --> 2:52:37.200]  And that question that Elon asked is the question they don't want us to ask.
[2:52:37.200 --> 2:52:38.200]  Who wrote your software?
[2:52:38.200 --> 2:52:40.200]  Who wrote your operating system?
[2:52:40.200 --> 2:52:43.200]  Because the whole thing is to trap us in the emotional control grid.
[2:52:43.200 --> 2:52:47.200]  Get us so flustered that we aren't asking these types of important questions.
[2:52:47.200 --> 2:52:50.200]  So we're controlled through lower dimensions of consciousness.
[2:52:50.200 --> 2:52:52.200]  There's only two forms of consciousness.
[2:52:52.200 --> 2:52:56.200]  There's a reactionary consciousness and a creation consciousness.
[2:52:56.200 --> 2:53:00.200]  And reactionary consciousness is when we're controlled by a fake identity.
[2:53:00.200 --> 2:53:03.200]  It's when we're so trapped into the world of the five senses
[2:53:03.200 --> 2:53:05.200]  that we're just reacting to everything that's happening.
[2:53:05.200 --> 2:53:08.200]  And that's how tyrants always control.
[2:53:08.200 --> 2:53:13.200]  And that's exactly why Vice attacked this before it even came out.
[2:53:13.200 --> 2:53:15.200]  That's exactly why we're urging you.
[2:53:15.200 --> 2:53:16.200]  Get this right now.
[2:53:16.200 --> 2:53:20.200]  We do not know if they're going to try to take this website down.
[2:53:20.200 --> 2:53:22.200]  They're already trying.
[2:53:22.200 --> 2:53:24.200]  Before it came out, Vice attacked it.
[2:53:24.200 --> 2:53:27.200]  There's two forms of consciousness, reactionary and creation.
[2:53:27.200 --> 2:53:31.200]  The whole goal is to trap us in a reactionary consciousness.
[2:53:31.200 --> 2:53:35.200]  But once you learn how to move to a creation consciousness and we start asking...
[2:53:35.200 --> 2:53:38.200]  Then you're not mad at people because they're white or they're black or they're older, they're young.
[2:53:38.200 --> 2:53:40.200]  You're not mad at them because they're a Democrat or a Republican.
[2:53:40.200 --> 2:53:42.200]  You see how your program, you begin transcendence.
[2:53:42.200 --> 2:53:44.200]  And not just that, right?
[2:53:44.200 --> 2:53:50.200]  It's once we all realize we are here for a reason and you start asking and I start asking
[2:53:50.200 --> 2:53:53.200]  and everyone starts asking, what's my purpose?
[2:53:53.200 --> 2:53:54.200]  What does God want from me?
[2:53:54.200 --> 2:53:58.200]  How can I get creatively inspired by these visions to change the medical system?
[2:53:58.200 --> 2:54:00.200]  Exactly. We talk about what is your purpose?
[2:54:00.200 --> 2:54:04.200]  What was God's program that God gave you that you have free will to take the mission or not?
[2:54:04.200 --> 2:54:05.200]  It's like mission impossible.
[2:54:05.200 --> 2:54:06.200]  Here is your message.
[2:54:06.200 --> 2:54:07.200]  Here is your mission.
[2:54:07.200 --> 2:54:09.200]  Choose whether you're going to take the mission or not.
[2:54:09.200 --> 2:54:12.200]  You have 60 seconds till this message destroys itself.
[2:54:12.200 --> 2:54:17.200]  Literally, Satan comes and sneaks and takes control and manipulates you and gets you to sign up for your power.
[2:54:17.200 --> 2:54:19.200]  God goes, here's the plan I had for you.
[2:54:19.200 --> 2:54:20.200]  Here's the destiny.
[2:54:20.200 --> 2:54:21.200]  It's a wide open plan.
[2:54:21.200 --> 2:54:22.200]  You can do a lot of things under this.
[2:54:22.200 --> 2:54:23.200]  But here's my plan.
[2:54:23.200 --> 2:54:24.200]  Do you accept this?
[2:54:24.200 --> 2:54:26.200]  You've got to accept that mission.
[2:54:26.200 --> 2:54:29.200]  Then like plugging into the wall with energy.
[2:54:29.200 --> 2:54:31.200]  A device doesn't have power.
[2:54:31.200 --> 2:54:32.200]  It's got power.
[2:54:32.200 --> 2:54:35.200]  Plugging into God now gives you that power of God, that God consciousness.
[2:54:35.200 --> 2:54:38.200]  Instead of plugging into Satan, you're going to plug into Satan.
[2:54:38.200 --> 2:54:39.200]  You're going to plug into God.
[2:54:39.200 --> 2:54:41.200]  We are all or both plugged into Satan and God.
[2:54:41.200 --> 2:54:44.200]  You want to more and more just unplug Satan and get plugged into God.
[2:54:44.200 --> 2:54:47.200]  The more you open that up, the more it happens.
[2:54:47.200 --> 2:54:55.200]  Look, you watching this, me, Alex, the Info Wars die hard warriors.
[2:54:55.200 --> 2:54:59.200]  We can actually change this world.
[2:54:59.200 --> 2:55:03.200]  When we're stuck in reactionary consciousness to everything that's happening, we can't.
[2:55:03.200 --> 2:55:09.200]  But imagine if 100,000 people, you and me, we start to rewrite our operating systems.
[2:55:09.200 --> 2:55:13.200]  Imagine if 100,000 of us actually start to move to creation consciousness.
[2:55:13.200 --> 2:55:17.200]  We actually start to recreate the medical system, the education system.
[2:55:17.200 --> 2:55:20.200]  Instead of going, yeah, I couldn't do that.
[2:55:20.200 --> 2:55:22.200]  Instead, we have that entire shift.
[2:55:22.200 --> 2:55:28.200]  And our office is, that God gave us the creation consciousness, the office of creation.
[2:55:28.200 --> 2:55:30.200]  We're designed to be doing that.
[2:55:30.200 --> 2:55:31.200]  Yes.
[2:55:31.200 --> 2:55:34.200]  And that's why everything's designed to keep you away from that.
[2:55:34.200 --> 2:55:37.200]  That's why vice attack this before it came out.
[2:55:37.200 --> 2:55:43.200]  If you want to win, if you want to stop the great reset, if you want to create a better world for your children
[2:55:43.200 --> 2:55:50.200]  and you want to protect your children and your family, the best thing that you can do is go to resetwars.com right now.
[2:55:50.200 --> 2:55:52.200]  Move through this course.
[2:55:52.200 --> 2:55:54.200]  Do these incredible exercises.
[2:55:54.200 --> 2:55:57.200]  This is different than anything Alex has ever done.
[2:55:57.200 --> 2:56:00.200]  And we can't even talk about a lot of this type of stuff on air.
[2:56:00.200 --> 2:56:02.200]  Is go to resetwars.com.
[2:56:02.200 --> 2:56:04.200]  Sign up for it right now.
[2:56:04.200 --> 2:56:07.200]  Absolutely, get 25% off until Wednesday morning.
[2:56:07.200 --> 2:56:09.200]  And again, it's going to help fund the operation.
[2:56:09.200 --> 2:56:11.200]  And it really is game changing information.
[2:56:11.200 --> 2:56:15.200]  And out of this, we're going to launch a whole bunch of other stuff that's coming very, very soon.
[2:56:15.200 --> 2:56:21.200]  And early next year, you're going to see so much more and just so many other reporters and people in the field.
[2:56:21.200 --> 2:56:27.200]  Because we have a responsibility in this time and era of such incredible change to give our maximum resistance to the new world order.
[2:56:27.200 --> 2:56:35.200]  And really understanding that our soul and spirit is separate from their programming that I've talked about so much needs to be codified.
[2:56:35.200 --> 2:56:40.200]  And it put into a very well presented documentary film book style.
[2:56:40.200 --> 2:56:43.200]  Resetwars.com, now available, now being sent out.
[2:56:43.200 --> 2:56:48.200]  Two members, 25% off if you sign up for the next 48 hours at resetwars.com.
[2:56:48.200 --> 2:56:51.200]  Jake Ducey, best selling author, researcher, really helped me get this done.
[2:56:51.200 --> 2:56:52.200]  Thank you so much.
[2:56:52.200 --> 2:56:56.200]  Tell people what you're going to be covering in the fourth hour when you're hosting.
[2:56:56.200 --> 2:57:04.200]  We're going to be diving exactly into the exercises, the steps to understand how they're moving the great reset agenda at you.
[2:57:04.200 --> 2:57:09.200]  And what you can do to protect yourself, prepare your friends, your family, and your community.
[2:57:09.200 --> 2:57:13.200]  Absolutely. You see people out there that seem like they're dead and not alive.
[2:57:13.200 --> 2:57:15.200]  You go try to talk to them. It's not that they have a low IQ.
[2:57:15.200 --> 2:57:22.200]  They're caught in a trance of just the programming and what they're interfacing with instead of being connected.
[2:57:22.200 --> 2:57:32.200]  And so we're trying to disconnect people from Satan and the New World Order and, you know, Mark Zuckerberg and Bill Gates to what did God design you to be?
[2:57:32.200 --> 2:57:36.200]  Who are you inside? Who's the real you? Not these things they told you you are.
[2:57:36.200 --> 2:57:40.200]  All right, those are just experiences you had. But who are you really at your core?
[2:57:40.200 --> 2:57:46.200]  They've declared war on humanity. Now we are declaring war on the great reset. Join Resetwars.
[2:57:46.200 --> 2:57:47.200]  Infowars.
[2:57:47.200 --> 2:57:51.200]  Everything I do is about victory for humanity.
[2:57:51.200 --> 2:57:56.200]  Everything I promote is about standing up against the New World Order by empowering humanity.
[2:57:56.200 --> 2:57:59.200]  Well, that's why Resetwars.com is so important.
[2:57:59.200 --> 2:58:04.200]  Not only is it a game-changing course of critical information to unlock your mind from the Matrix,
[2:58:04.200 --> 2:58:14.200]  but it's something that gets around Claw Schwab's attempt to shut down American infrastructure and American jobs.
[2:58:14.200 --> 2:58:21.200]  It is the true digital economy. It's the spiritual economy of the mind and transcendent or control.
[2:58:21.200 --> 2:58:29.200]  I've been on there 28 years and all of our work has been amazing thanks to God and God's divine empowerment and blessing.
[2:58:29.200 --> 2:58:37.200]  But I got to tell you, out of everything I've done, Resetwars is the most important and it is now available now at the month of December 20.

[2:58:50.200 --> 2:58:55.200]  And 20% off plus free shipping and double Patriot points for our new sale.
[2:58:55.200 --> 2:58:59.200]  After years of being off the shelves or bringing back one of the biggest fan favorite formulas ever,
[2:58:59.200 --> 2:59:02.200]  and it's now been reformulated as even stronger.

[2:59:09.200 --> 2:59:14.200]  that's so amazing, chaga mushroom, beef pollen, goji berry, alfalfa herb powder.
[2:59:14.200 --> 2:59:17.200]  Then it's got added magnesium and potassium for electrolytes.
[2:59:17.200 --> 2:59:24.200]  It's got real organic cocoa bean powder with natural chocolate flavor and a touch of sea salt.
[2:59:24.200 --> 2:59:28.200]  It even tastes better than the last formula and what it does for your body is simply amazing.
[2:59:28.200 --> 2:59:35.200]  It has that cutting edge, chicken broth, protein, isolate powder for better flavor and solvability.

[3:00:00.200 --> 3:00:06.200]  All right, we're back live broadcasting worldwide.
[3:00:06.200 --> 3:00:15.200]  I like to give paradoxes or parables or examples of things in the real world and then align it to our minds, our souls, our bodies.
[3:00:15.200 --> 3:00:19.200]  It's not bad if you live in a big mega city because of your job and you like metropolitan lifestyle
[3:00:19.200 --> 3:00:25.200]  and I like parts of it as well other than the young globalist crime syndicates that are creating lawlessness.
[3:00:25.200 --> 3:00:30.200]  But why are all the rich and powerful people selling their penthouses for years and moving to the country?
[3:00:30.200 --> 3:00:38.200]  Because they know their engineering collapse, but more importantly than geographically moving away from the new world order
[3:00:38.200 --> 3:00:44.200]  and from what they've done at East, is geographically at the mental level, the spiritual level,
[3:00:44.200 --> 3:00:48.200]  deciding that you're not under their jurisdiction, you're not under their program anymore
[3:00:48.200 --> 3:00:54.200]  and you're aware of how they're programming you from their own documents and I'm telling you, it's amazing.
[3:00:54.200 --> 3:01:00.200]  If you just took the information and reset wars and use 10% of it, which I'm using because it's theoretical, incredible,
[3:01:00.200 --> 3:01:07.200]  but I'm using maybe 10% of it and we've changed the world with that, it's game over for them.
[3:01:07.200 --> 3:01:10.200]  So everything they're doing is trying to suppress the Great Awakening that's happening.
[3:01:10.200 --> 3:01:12.200]  So we study what is the cutting edge of the Great Awakening?
[3:01:12.200 --> 3:01:14.200]  What are they using to control us?
[3:01:14.200 --> 3:01:19.200]  Let's accelerate the exodus not just out of the big cities because if you can do that, that's a smart move.
[3:01:19.200 --> 3:01:29.200]  I would do that, but also having an exodus of our minds in the world but not of the world as Jake Ducey was just saying earlier.
[3:01:29.200 --> 3:01:31.200]  And that's exactly what has to happen.
[3:01:31.200 --> 3:01:38.200]  I was just reading back through this Vice News article which apparently calls me a, apparently I'm a hypnotist now.
[3:01:38.200 --> 3:01:42.200]  And what Alex always talks about, what they do is they project everything that they are.
[3:01:42.200 --> 3:01:44.200]  They've created an entire hypnotism.
[3:01:44.200 --> 3:01:47.200]  The whole portion is about getting out of hypnotism.
[3:01:47.200 --> 3:01:52.200]  And they frame it in a way where they're obviously they're afraid of this coming out
[3:01:52.200 --> 3:01:55.200]  and they try to get ahead of the curve because they don't want this to get out.
[3:01:55.200 --> 3:02:00.200]  But they frame it in a way where they want you to think that it's weird or new age
[3:02:00.200 --> 3:02:05.200]  even though they have 100,000, 200,000 documents explaining exactly...
[3:02:05.200 --> 3:02:09.200]  And even though they're using those techniques, we don't want you in a near sleep state of sleep.
[3:02:09.200 --> 3:02:11.200]  We're trying to get you out of it.
[3:02:11.200 --> 3:02:13.200]  We want you to be aware that they're hypnotizing you.
[3:02:13.200 --> 3:02:15.200]  That's not hypnotism.
[3:02:15.200 --> 3:02:20.200]  Exactly. And the reality is, that's why I said earlier, once we realize,
[3:02:20.200 --> 3:02:26.200]  ah, we're already MK Ultra patients, you and me, then we can break out of it.
[3:02:26.200 --> 3:02:30.200]  All these same systems they use to take away people's entire minds,
[3:02:30.200 --> 3:02:34.200]  they're already using in a very complex system of microwave warfare.
[3:02:34.200 --> 3:02:38.200]  They call it non-lethal energy weapons.
[3:02:38.200 --> 3:02:41.200]  Oh, the 5G is in the documents.
[3:02:41.200 --> 3:02:47.200]  It works as a communication system, but it can also be used because it's so rapid fire to fluctuate.
[3:02:47.200 --> 3:02:51.200]  It's 1% as strong as a microwave oven, but it doesn't matter.
[3:02:51.200 --> 3:02:56.200]  It's how it hits your cells and flickers at their rate to trigger and program them.
[3:02:56.200 --> 3:03:04.200]  Exactly. And my life changed once I realized that if we're going to win, this is an inner battle.
[3:03:04.200 --> 3:03:06.200]  That's what has to happen.
[3:03:06.200 --> 3:03:11.200]  So they're getting ahead of the curve already trying to push people away from it,
[3:03:11.200 --> 3:03:14.200]  which as we know, this is only going to push people closer towards it.
[3:03:14.200 --> 3:03:18.200]  And when this happens, this is when we win.
[3:03:18.200 --> 3:03:21.200]  This is why you can be optimistic.
[3:03:21.200 --> 3:03:24.200]  If you're depressed, if you're stressed, if you're angry right now,
[3:03:24.200 --> 3:03:31.200]  I'm asking you to go join resetwars.com because there's a lot of things that we can be optimistic about.
[3:03:31.200 --> 3:03:35.200]  There's more and more people waking up every single solitary day.
[3:03:35.200 --> 3:03:37.200]  And wow, there's a lot of bad news happening.
[3:03:37.200 --> 3:03:38.200]  Wouldn't you agree, Alex?
[3:03:38.200 --> 3:03:40.200]  More people are waking up every day.
[3:03:40.200 --> 3:03:44.200]  Well, all the bads happening because the globalists admit their own WikiLeaks,
[3:03:44.200 --> 3:03:46.200]  they're trying to stop us from breaking free of them.
[3:03:46.200 --> 3:03:47.200]  It's very simple.
[3:03:47.200 --> 3:03:52.200]  And if you're aware of the fact that they know you've got the real you and they program this artificial you
[3:03:52.200 --> 3:03:55.200]  and they're trying to trauma-based mind control children from birth,
[3:03:55.200 --> 3:03:58.200]  no matter how much of this you've got, everybody's got some of it.
[3:03:58.200 --> 3:04:01.200]  It's very valuable, extremely valuable.
[3:04:01.200 --> 3:04:03.200]  I mean, I don't promote anything that isn't hardcore and valuable.
[3:04:03.200 --> 3:04:05.200]  And this is the most valuable information we've ever put out.
[3:04:05.200 --> 3:04:09.200]  I just hope you realize how powerful it is because sometimes the most incredible stuff I put out
[3:04:09.200 --> 3:04:14.200]  kind of just lays forgotten for a decade or five years until people discover it and then figure it out
[3:04:14.200 --> 3:04:16.200]  once it's already come to pass.
[3:04:16.200 --> 3:04:17.200]  No, no, this is the future.
[3:04:17.200 --> 3:04:18.200]  This is next year's news.
[3:04:18.200 --> 3:04:20.200]  This is next millennia's news today.
[3:04:20.200 --> 3:04:23.200]  This is the future of consciousness now.
[3:04:23.200 --> 3:04:32.200]  Yeah, the reason that I'm really optimistic and why I am up here telling you why you need to join resetwars
[3:04:32.200 --> 3:04:39.200]  is because the next iteration for us to win is not just learning what their playbook is,
[3:04:39.200 --> 3:04:43.200]  but realizing that we can do something about it.
[3:04:43.200 --> 3:04:45.200]  And everyone's role is going to be different.
[3:04:45.200 --> 3:04:50.200]  Yours may be a broadcaster like Alex, or yours may be in the medical system, or the education system.
[3:04:50.200 --> 3:04:52.200]  Stay there. You're going to take over the rest of the hour.
[3:04:52.200 --> 3:04:53.200]  I'm going to be listening in 60 seconds.
[3:04:53.200 --> 3:04:55.200]  Jake Ducey, stay with us.
[3:04:55.200 --> 3:05:03.200]  Everything I want our champions made of here's a man who can show you.
[3:05:25.200 --> 3:05:36.200]  In the war store, hotline, triple eight to five, three, three, one, three, nine, is the info store.
[3:05:36.200 --> 3:05:39.200]  infowarstore.com is simply the best.
[3:05:39.200 --> 3:05:42.200]  infowarstore.com beats out all the rest.
[3:05:42.200 --> 3:05:49.200]  Triple eight to five, three, three, one, three, nine, is the info store.
[3:05:49.200 --> 3:05:57.200]  triple eight to five, three, nine, triple eight to five, three, one, three, nine, triple eight to five, three, one, three, nine, is the info store.com.
[3:05:57.200 --> 3:06:10.200]  And it's time for humanity to stand up in the info war and say, I don't know what's going to happen at the end of this,
[3:06:10.200 --> 3:06:15.200]  but you want to fight, you better believe, you got one.
[3:06:15.200 --> 3:06:21.200]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[3:06:36.200 --> 3:06:41.200]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones show and info wars.
[3:06:41.200 --> 3:06:44.200]  I am filling in for the fourth hour here.
[3:06:44.200 --> 3:06:46.200]  My name is Jake Ducey.
[3:06:46.200 --> 3:06:53.200]  And I have to tell you, I never would have thought that I'd be sitting here right now on the Alex Jones show,
[3:06:53.200 --> 3:06:57.200]  not only being on his show, but hosting the show.
[3:06:57.200 --> 3:07:06.200]  And here's what I realized when I was watching through, I've been able to watch through Alex's new online course reset wars.
[3:07:06.200 --> 3:07:10.200]  I don't know, six, seven times I got to sit in a room while this whole thing was recorded.
[3:07:10.200 --> 3:07:12.200]  And here's what I realized.
[3:07:12.200 --> 3:07:14.200]  You have no idea.
[3:07:14.200 --> 3:07:18.200]  I have no idea what God really has planned for us.
[3:07:18.200 --> 3:07:25.200]  But the whole way that they win, the whole way that the system wins is if we go, why is this happening?
[3:07:25.200 --> 3:07:26.200]  There's nothing we can do.
[3:07:26.200 --> 3:07:27.200]  Oh, it's making me so mad.
[3:07:27.200 --> 3:07:32.200]  But as soon as we detach from what Alex calls in the course, the emotional control grid,
[3:07:32.200 --> 3:07:36.200]  which is really the entire operating system of how they control everything,
[3:07:36.200 --> 3:07:43.200]  the emotional control grid, because emotion, Alex talks about emotion is energy in motion.
[3:07:43.200 --> 3:07:45.200]  So our emotional states is energy in motion.
[3:07:45.200 --> 3:07:50.200]  We know that everything, including a pen, is really just a vibrating speed of energy.
[3:07:50.200 --> 3:07:56.200]  Well, the emotional control grid is all about trapping us in our energy and motion in very low planes of consciousness.
[3:07:56.200 --> 3:08:03.200]  When we're depressed, when we're angry, even if we know what's happening in the world, it's one thing to be informed.
[3:08:03.200 --> 3:08:09.200]  And then I realized as I was moving through this, I'm a lot more optimistic than I've ever been before.
[3:08:09.200 --> 3:08:14.200]  And that's because once we start to ask ourselves, what does God want from me?
[3:08:14.200 --> 3:08:16.200]  What am I really meant to be doing?
[3:08:16.200 --> 3:08:20.200]  What is the software that's been written into my operating system?
[3:08:20.200 --> 3:08:24.200]  Whether it's software from your parents and your upbringing you inherited,
[3:08:24.200 --> 3:08:30.200]  whether it's trauma growing up when you were younger, all of these things are running our operating system.
[3:08:30.200 --> 3:08:33.200]  95% of our whole life is subconscious.
[3:08:33.200 --> 3:08:36.200]  So I'm sitting up here telling you, you know, you might be listening and you're like,
[3:08:36.200 --> 3:08:39.200]  oh, should I buy this thing or why should I do this thing?
[3:08:39.200 --> 3:08:46.200]  As someone who's been a fan of Alex for over 10 years, I can tell you this is the most important thing that he's ever done.
[3:08:46.200 --> 3:08:53.200]  The reason that this is the most important thing that he's ever done is because we cannot win
[3:08:53.200 --> 3:08:58.200]  unless all of us realize that we're more powerful than we ever imagined
[3:08:58.200 --> 3:09:02.200]  when we've been running on an operating system that isn't even ours.
[3:09:02.200 --> 3:09:09.200]  In the course, Alex breaks down how the mind control system works in trauma-based mind control.
[3:09:09.200 --> 3:09:16.200]  Now, one of the ways that this works, if you see this Elon quote here, he's talking about mental firewalls.
[3:09:16.200 --> 3:09:20.200]  And I sent this to Alex because the day before, Alex and I broke down this whole thing.
[3:09:20.200 --> 3:09:26.200]  The mental firewalls term comes from Richard Cesaro, who was the old director of DARPA,
[3:09:26.200 --> 3:09:31.200]  and in one of his declassified documents, he says that they are certain
[3:09:31.200 --> 3:09:38.200]  that because the mind has quote, no firewall from incoming weaponry,
[3:09:38.200 --> 3:09:44.200]  then you can make people think, feel, and believe anything, and they don't even know what's happening.
[3:09:44.200 --> 3:09:48.200]  Well, this begins at about the age that you were six years old,
[3:09:48.200 --> 3:09:54.200]  because up until you're six years old, you're in a brainwave state akin to hypnosis.
[3:09:54.200 --> 3:09:58.200]  That's when all of the software starts to be written,
[3:09:58.200 --> 3:10:01.200]  and that's what makes us believe that we're kind of helpless,
[3:10:01.200 --> 3:10:04.200]  or that maybe what has you in debt slavery,
[3:10:04.200 --> 3:10:09.200]  or maybe that's what has you at the same level you were at last year in your career.
[3:10:09.200 --> 3:10:13.200]  But all of this is just an operating system that we can rewire.
[3:10:13.200 --> 3:10:18.200]  And if we can rewire the operating system to become more optimistic
[3:10:18.200 --> 3:10:22.200]  or rewire the operating system to improve our financial lives,
[3:10:22.200 --> 3:10:27.200]  couldn't we rewire the operating system to literally take down the great reset?
[3:10:27.200 --> 3:10:30.200]  Couldn't we do that? And that's why I'm saying,
[3:10:30.200 --> 3:10:38.200]  if 10,000 or 20,000 people in the InfoWars community come together right now,
[3:10:38.200 --> 3:10:42.200]  and you join ResetWars, you go to resetwars.com right now,
[3:10:42.200 --> 3:10:45.200]  and you sign up to resetwars.com right now,
[3:10:45.200 --> 3:10:53.200]  that's how we win, because we realize that we're all part of an MK Ultra experiment.
[3:10:53.200 --> 3:11:00.200]  It is a state of hypnosis to believe that you aren't as powerful as Alex Jones.
[3:11:00.200 --> 3:11:03.200]  You aren't as powerful as Joe Rogan.
[3:11:03.200 --> 3:11:07.200]  Well, Mark Zuckerberg and all the tech giants have all the power.
[3:11:07.200 --> 3:11:10.200]  That is hypnosis. It may seem like reality,
[3:11:10.200 --> 3:11:15.200]  but reality is a very small bandwidth of energy that we think is real.
[3:11:15.200 --> 3:11:21.200]  It's really not real. It's just a very small bandwidth of energy called visible light.
[3:11:21.200 --> 3:11:28.200]  And when we all go inside and we start erasing those viruses, guess what?
[3:11:28.200 --> 3:11:30.200]  The game's over.
[3:11:30.200 --> 3:11:36.200]  And at the beginning of the course, Alex talks about a movie called War Games.
[3:11:36.200 --> 3:11:40.200]  And I think he said it was filmed in 1983, I believe.
[3:11:40.200 --> 3:11:42.200]  And it's how the course starts.
[3:11:42.200 --> 3:11:47.200]  The course begins with breaking down what is the mind wars and what is the spirit wars.
[3:11:47.200 --> 3:11:53.200]  And he says in the War Games in 1983 film,
[3:11:53.200 --> 3:12:00.200]  what if you could win the game by no longer playing the game?
[3:12:00.200 --> 3:12:04.200]  What if you could win the game by no longer playing the game?
[3:12:04.200 --> 3:12:06.200]  And that's what Elon's talking about.
[3:12:06.200 --> 3:12:12.200]  Once the firewall operating system breaks apart,
[3:12:12.200 --> 3:12:16.200]  then the mind becomes a totally clean slate to recreate reality.
[3:12:16.200 --> 3:12:20.200]  So, you know, one of Alex's most viral clips, everyone's probably seen it.
[3:12:20.200 --> 3:12:28.200]  You know, he goes on Joe Rogan and for 11 seconds he says some stuff about how reality is created
[3:12:28.200 --> 3:12:30.200]  from higher consciousness and everyone says,
[3:12:30.200 --> 3:12:34.200]  gosh, that's the best thing of Alex Jones I've ever seen.
[3:12:34.200 --> 3:12:38.200]  Well, imagine moving through an entire course where Alex codified and organized all of this.
[3:12:38.200 --> 3:12:43.200]  He's an entire section all on quantum physics where he breaks down what is the nature of reality,
[3:12:43.200 --> 3:12:52.200]  what is the observer effect, and how they use the observer effect to create predictive programming to control reality.
[3:12:52.200 --> 3:12:59.200]  The observer effect, right, which is everything that we think of as physical matter is made up of energy.
[3:12:59.200 --> 3:13:06.200]  That energy is made up of subatomic particles and those subatomic particles sometimes are real,
[3:13:06.200 --> 3:13:10.200]  sometimes they're invisible, sometimes they're particles and sometimes they're waves,
[3:13:10.200 --> 3:13:12.200]  they're energy in another dimension.
[3:13:12.200 --> 3:13:15.200]  Well, those subatomic particles make up all of reality.
[3:13:15.200 --> 3:13:20.200]  They make up your bank account, they make up our general social stability in our world,
[3:13:20.200 --> 3:13:26.200]  they make up your relationships, your health, they make up the entire history of where humanity is going next,
[3:13:26.200 --> 3:13:29.200]  the observer effect that consciousness creates reality.
[3:13:29.200 --> 3:13:35.200]  So Alex breaks down how they use this on a collective level and a personal level to control you.
[3:13:35.200 --> 3:13:40.200]  One of the ways they do that is through predictive programming, collective unconscious hypnosis,
[3:13:40.200 --> 3:13:46.200]  which is when we're at last section Alex and I were talking about how there's two modes of consciousness.
[3:13:46.200 --> 3:13:49.200]  One is reactionary and one is creation.
[3:13:49.200 --> 3:13:54.200]  When they trap you in reactionary consciousness, when they trap me in reactionary consciousness,
[3:13:54.200 --> 3:13:56.200]  we're screwed, we can't do anything about it.
[3:13:56.200 --> 3:14:04.200]  Once they trap you in that, you are then using the observer effect to create your own enslavement.
[3:14:04.200 --> 3:14:07.200]  People do it with their finances all the time, people do it with their career all the time.
[3:14:07.200 --> 3:14:12.200]  They think it's because the New World Order controls the financial system that they can't retire their parents,
[3:14:12.200 --> 3:14:14.200]  that they can't move their finances to the next level.
[3:14:14.200 --> 3:14:19.200]  They can't double triple their income, use all that extra money to fund a movement in their community
[3:14:19.200 --> 3:14:26.200]  to build a new education system, to fund a new doctor's office, a new private practice
[3:14:26.200 --> 3:14:29.200]  that doesn't abide by the medical tyranny system.
[3:14:29.200 --> 3:14:32.200]  This is what has to happen for us to win.
[3:14:32.200 --> 3:14:38.200]  And so when I'm standing up here and I'm telling you to go to resetwars.com,
[3:14:38.200 --> 3:14:46.200]  I can tell you assuredly and honestly, this is the most powerful Alex Jones,
[3:14:46.200 --> 3:14:52.200]  probably film, piece of content you have ever seen in your entire life.
[3:14:52.200 --> 3:14:58.200]  We can say honestly, not as some sales gimmick, we do not know how long this is going to be available.
[3:14:58.200 --> 3:15:06.200]  Before this came out, Vice News hit us with a hit piece on it, apparently called me a hypnotist even though I'm not.
[3:15:06.200 --> 3:15:10.200]  What are they doing? They're trying as quickly as possible to run damage control on this
[3:15:10.200 --> 3:15:13.200]  because they don't want this coming out.
[3:15:13.200 --> 3:15:19.200]  With leaving some of the details out, we've already had attacks on softwares,
[3:15:19.200 --> 3:15:21.200]  operating systems before it's even come out.
[3:15:21.200 --> 3:15:25.200]  It's been constant trying to put out a fire to recreate this.
[3:15:25.200 --> 3:15:27.200]  We don't know how long this is available.
[3:15:27.200 --> 3:15:34.200]  This is the best way to fund the InfoWars operation because it moves them away from the supply chain disruptions.
[3:15:34.200 --> 3:15:39.200]  So go to resetwars.com right now, click that green button right there that says,

[3:16:19.200 --> 3:16:25.200]  That's now their corporate face while they run slave camps in Africa and in communist China and many other areas
[3:16:25.200 --> 3:16:31.200]  while they undermine our basic liberties here and spy on us through the big tech in the central banks and other zone.
[3:16:31.200 --> 3:16:37.200]  So this is a criminal takeover and when you look at the new superclass, it's the politicians,
[3:16:37.200 --> 3:16:43.200]  it's the corporate media, it's the police, it's the bureaucrats, it's members of Congress and their staff,
[3:16:43.200 --> 3:16:50.200]  and their families, it's the White House, hell it's postal workers who were all exempt from the poison shots
[3:16:50.200 --> 3:16:54.200]  but not the general public and everybody else through corporate rule.
[3:16:54.200 --> 3:16:56.200]  So this is the true discrimination that's going on.
[3:16:56.200 --> 3:17:03.200]  I am a worldly person meaning I like going to ball games, I like going to concerts, I like going to play golf,
[3:17:03.200 --> 3:17:09.200]  I like going out to dinner, I like the metropolitan life, I like everything that comes with this.
[3:17:09.200 --> 3:17:15.200]  But see, I have the survival instinct that is to get the hell out of Democrat run cities,
[3:17:15.200 --> 3:17:21.200]  get the hell out of major metropolitan areas because unless we change course soon, it's all crashing down.
[3:17:21.200 --> 3:17:25.200]  Is it time to just move out to the woods, just time to go get a piece of property in the woods,
[3:17:25.200 --> 3:17:29.200]  just get off grid, just get the emergency food supplies, just live off the land?
[3:17:29.200 --> 3:17:30.200]  That's the survival instinct.
[3:17:30.200 --> 3:17:36.200]  But see the worldly part of me that's still probably the majority part of me says no, no, no, no, stay in the city.
[3:17:36.200 --> 3:17:41.200]  The survival instinct says get the hell out of anywhere there's ever notion that you need to get a vaccine or a mask.
[3:17:41.200 --> 3:17:47.200]  That's the internal struggle that my guess is a lot of you in the audience are facing as well.
[3:17:47.200 --> 3:17:52.200]  But you can at least have some comfort if you have the emergency food supplies
[3:17:52.200 --> 3:17:54.200]  and so we have the best ones at InfowarsStore.com.

[3:18:29.200 --> 3:18:31.200]  Smartphones are always tracking everything you do.
[3:18:31.200 --> 3:18:32.200]  These aren't.
[3:18:32.200 --> 3:18:33.200]  And the calls are free when folks call you.
[3:18:33.200 --> 3:18:38.200]  You just pay $99.95 a month for your minutes, $150.
[3:18:38.200 --> 3:18:42.200]  So the calls you are free or take a regular cell phone, you're not being tracked or traced.
[3:18:42.200 --> 3:18:43.200]  And I keep one in my car.
[3:18:43.200 --> 3:18:47.200]  I've given it to my parents as gifts way out the middle of nowhere where regular phones don't work.
[3:18:47.200 --> 3:18:48.200]  They work.
[3:18:48.200 --> 3:18:55.200]  Infowarsphone.com or 941-955-1029-4195-1020 and ask the Alex Jones special.
[3:18:56.200 --> 3:18:59.200]  UN run contact tracers aren't coming.
[3:18:59.200 --> 3:19:04.200]  They're here all over the world from Australia to the United States from Canada to Germany.
[3:19:04.200 --> 3:19:08.200]  These tyrants are tracking everything you do everywhere you go and then coming to your house
[3:19:08.200 --> 3:19:14.200]  and threatening in some cases actually taking people away into the night to their facilities.
[3:19:14.200 --> 3:19:19.200]  And they're planning the next year to expand their shield process where they come and take,
[3:19:19.200 --> 3:19:23.200]  quote, healthy people away and put them in facilities for their safety.
[3:19:23.200 --> 3:19:25.200]  This is nothing less than martial law.
[3:19:25.200 --> 3:19:29.200]  And one big thing you can do to fight back is to get high quality Faraday cages,
[3:19:29.200 --> 3:19:32.200]  many of which are made here in America and are very compliant,
[3:19:32.200 --> 3:19:36.200]  meaning U.S. government military grade at Infowarsstore.com.
[3:19:36.200 --> 3:19:42.200]  We have the entire line of silent pocket ready to ship to you when you visit Infowarsstore.com.
[3:19:42.200 --> 3:19:43.200]  Again, we have big backpacks.
[3:19:43.200 --> 3:19:45.200]  We have special dry bags.
[3:19:45.200 --> 3:19:46.200]  We've got them for cell phones.
[3:19:46.200 --> 3:19:48.200]  We've got them for laptops.
[3:19:48.200 --> 3:19:49.200]  We've got them for iPads.
[3:19:49.200 --> 3:19:51.200]  It's all there at Infowarsstore.com.
[3:19:51.200 --> 3:19:57.200]  So protect your privacy today and support the Infowar at Infowarsstore.com.
[3:19:57.200 --> 3:20:07.200]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[3:20:07.200 --> 3:20:24.200]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones show. This is Jake Ducey here, and I am here in honor of the release of what I believe is the greatest thing that Alex and the Infowars team have ever created.
[3:20:24.200 --> 3:20:28.200]  And that's Alex's brand new online training reset course.
[3:20:28.200 --> 3:20:38.200]  I've had the privilege and the honor to watch this through six, seven, eight times. I actually got to sit in the room and watch this entire thing live.
[3:20:38.200 --> 3:20:46.200]  And so when I'm sitting here telling you this is the most powerful information you're ever going to come across, this is what they don't want you to know.
[3:20:46.200 --> 3:20:47.200]  I'm not just saying it.
[3:20:47.200 --> 3:20:49.200]  We've already had Vice News attack us.
[3:20:49.200 --> 3:20:55.200]  We've already had, without getting into the details, we've had numerous issues with program software systems.
[3:20:55.200 --> 3:21:00.200]  Things getting shut down in advance of this coming out. They don't want this out.
[3:21:00.200 --> 3:21:08.200]  And so for the next 48 hours, it is on sale 25% off, 25% off for the next 48 hours.
[3:21:08.200 --> 3:21:11.200]  So you can go to resetwars.com right now and sign up.
[3:21:11.200 --> 3:21:16.200]  And I can tell you honestly that this is unlike anything Alex has ever done before.
[3:21:16.200 --> 3:21:20.200]  There's a lot of stuff that we can't say while we're live on air here.
[3:21:20.200 --> 3:21:23.200]  But this is different than the show.
[3:21:23.200 --> 3:21:27.200]  First of all, this is Alex in a way that you've quite literally never seen before.
[3:21:27.200 --> 3:21:36.200]  And second of all, what this is starting to do is peel back the layers on what this whole agenda is really all about.
[3:21:36.200 --> 3:21:48.200]  And Jack Pasoba, he tweeted quite a while ago that the most underrated aspect of this takeover is that it is really a psychological war.
[3:21:48.200 --> 3:21:53.200]  It's a psychological war to do a few things. It's a psychological war to convince you that you aren't good enough,
[3:21:53.200 --> 3:21:55.200]  to convince you you aren't smart enough.
[3:21:55.200 --> 3:21:58.200]  It's a psychological war to make you destroy yourself.
[3:21:58.200 --> 3:22:04.200]  Because once we're in these lower emotional states that Alex talks about in the course, the emotional control grid, then what?
[3:22:04.200 --> 3:22:08.200]  Then we have to sabotage to get away from those emotional states.
[3:22:08.200 --> 3:22:14.200]  Which is why we have such an incredible rise in over time.
[3:22:14.200 --> 3:22:20.200]  This is why we have such an incredible rise in overdoses, in alcoholism.
[3:22:20.200 --> 3:22:25.200]  Why? This is designed to do this.
[3:22:25.200 --> 3:22:28.200]  They don't win by us just knowing their plans.
[3:22:28.200 --> 3:22:30.200]  They win, they lose.
[3:22:30.200 --> 3:22:38.200]  When we know what their plans are, we reverse engineer their playbook and we start to use it in our everyday life.
[3:22:38.200 --> 3:22:40.200]  And that's what Reset Wars is all about.
[3:22:40.200 --> 3:22:45.200]  And that's why I'm standing up here telling you that this is the greatest thing that he's ever created.
[3:22:45.200 --> 3:22:49.200]  They don't want this out because this is when the shifts finally start to occur.
[3:22:49.200 --> 3:22:53.200]  When we ask ourselves these questions, what does God really want from me?
[3:22:53.200 --> 3:22:56.200]  What am I really capable of?
[3:22:56.200 --> 3:23:01.200]  Because we're not going to win if just Alex Jones and Joe Rogan are out there fighting the fight.
[3:23:01.200 --> 3:23:07.200]  I had no idea that I would ever be where I am in this very second right now.
[3:23:07.200 --> 3:23:11.200]  Because God has a plan for you.
[3:23:11.200 --> 3:23:20.200]  Your soul has a plan for you that's so much bigger than you can possibly imagine.
[3:23:20.200 --> 3:23:29.200]  So in order to stop that flame, they have to throw as much psychological warfare at you as humanly possible.
[3:23:29.200 --> 3:23:33.200]  To trap us back in the lower dimensions of consciousness.
[3:23:33.200 --> 3:23:38.200]  So we don't realize we're in this world, but we're not of this world.
[3:23:38.200 --> 3:23:42.200]  Because once we realize that we're in this world, but we're not of this world, then what happens?
[3:23:42.200 --> 3:23:44.200]  We wake up to the entire control grid.
[3:23:44.200 --> 3:23:48.200]  We no longer give our power away to the giant mega churches.
[3:23:48.200 --> 3:23:51.200]  We no longer give our power away to the experts.
[3:23:51.200 --> 3:23:58.200]  This entire system starts to fall apart and that's why they're rushing to push all of this across.
[3:23:58.200 --> 3:24:05.200]  So right now, if you are feeling depressed, if you're feeling overwhelmed, if you're feeling stressed, if you're feeling unsure,
[3:24:05.200 --> 3:24:09.200]  it's because they want us to stay trapped in those emotions.
[3:24:09.200 --> 3:24:14.200]  But there is a way out of it.
[3:24:14.200 --> 3:24:16.200]  And that's why Alex put together Reset Wars.
[3:24:16.200 --> 3:24:18.200]  You might be wondering what's in it, what's it about.
[3:24:18.200 --> 3:24:21.200]  So Alex broke this down in 10 or 11 chapters.
[3:24:21.200 --> 3:24:24.200]  Each chapter is breaking down from the start.
[3:24:24.200 --> 3:24:26.200]  What is the mind wars? What is the spirit wars?
[3:24:26.200 --> 3:24:32.200]  Taking you inside your own mind to find out how the operating system for your own mind and your own life was built,
[3:24:32.200 --> 3:24:36.200]  how to rewire it, going through the history of mind control,
[3:24:36.200 --> 3:24:42.200]  going through the history of quantum physics and the nature of reality,
[3:24:42.200 --> 3:24:50.200]  and how this seemingly esoteric nature of reality is actually a very practical scientific reality
[3:24:50.200 --> 3:24:55.200]  that they've carefully engineered in order to create this control grid.
[3:24:55.200 --> 3:24:58.200]  Because we think, well, they're controlling us.
[3:24:58.200 --> 3:25:00.200]  In reality, they are not.
[3:25:00.200 --> 3:25:06.200]  In reality, we are controlling ourselves through the observer effect by staying in a reactionary consciousness.
[3:25:06.200 --> 3:25:11.200]  And the whole way that this works is for us to never awake to that.
[3:25:11.200 --> 3:25:14.200]  But once we do awake to it, the game's over.
[3:25:14.200 --> 3:25:17.200]  The game's over, the game's finished.
[3:25:17.200 --> 3:25:20.200]  So that's resetwars.com.
[3:25:20.200 --> 3:25:25.200]  You can go ahead and you can sign up and become a founding member right now at resetwars.com.
[3:25:25.200 --> 3:25:28.200]  And I've been able to show this to a handful of my friends and family.
[3:25:28.200 --> 3:25:33.200]  I've had people come up and quit drinking alcohol after watching this.
[3:25:33.200 --> 3:25:37.200]  I've had people just really have their lives changed by it.
[3:25:37.200 --> 3:25:41.200]  And so I tell Alex, you say, this is going to be the thing that someone's going to walk up to you
[3:25:41.200 --> 3:25:44.200]  and their whole lives going to have changed from this.
[3:25:44.200 --> 3:25:48.200]  And this is why it's so important, because this is an energy game that they're playing here.
[3:25:48.200 --> 3:25:52.200]  This is an energy game. It's not just a news game, it's an energy game
[3:25:52.200 --> 3:25:55.200]  that they're playing and that they're operating here in front of us.
[3:25:55.200 --> 3:25:59.200]  And once we have that shift, then the game's over.
[3:25:59.200 --> 3:26:02.200]  So the question is, who am I?
[3:26:02.200 --> 3:26:04.200]  Who am I really?
[3:26:04.200 --> 3:26:07.200]  And why am I really here?
[3:26:07.200 --> 3:26:09.200]  And that'd be my challenge to you.
[3:26:09.200 --> 3:26:13.200]  That'd be my invitation to you to ask yourself that question today.
[3:26:13.200 --> 3:26:16.200]  Who are you really?
[3:26:16.200 --> 3:26:19.200]  And Alex breaks this whole, all of this down in the course.
[3:26:19.200 --> 3:26:22.200]  That's why I'm saying go to resetwars.com and sign up right now.
[3:26:22.200 --> 3:26:25.200]  25% off for a limited period of time.
[3:26:25.200 --> 3:26:27.200]  This is unlike anything Alex has ever put together.
[3:26:27.200 --> 3:26:30.200]  But he says, who are you?
[3:26:30.200 --> 3:26:35.200]  Well, you aren't a body, because we know through curling photography,
[3:26:35.200 --> 3:26:39.200]  which is in many declassified CIA documents.
[3:26:39.200 --> 3:26:43.200]  This looks like my body ends right here and who Jake is,
[3:26:43.200 --> 3:26:46.200]  and it ends at my nose and it ends right here.
[3:26:46.200 --> 3:26:48.200]  I'm really a field of energy.
[3:26:48.200 --> 3:26:51.200]  My field of energy extends far beyond my own physical body.
[3:26:51.200 --> 3:26:54.200]  And that's why they have energy weapons.
[3:26:54.200 --> 3:26:57.200]  That's why they call them non-lethal energy weapons.
[3:26:57.200 --> 3:27:02.200]  That's why they have low-radiation frequency patterns, microwave patterns.
[3:27:02.200 --> 3:27:05.200]  Because it's designed to trap you in your emotions
[3:27:05.200 --> 3:27:07.200]  so you think you're just a physical body.
[3:27:07.200 --> 3:27:09.200]  But you exist on three planes.
[3:27:09.200 --> 3:27:14.200]  The mental plane, the physical plane, and the spiritual plane.
[3:27:14.200 --> 3:27:16.200]  So who are you really?
[3:27:16.200 --> 3:27:19.200]  There's an example of curling photography right there.
[3:27:19.200 --> 3:27:21.200]  So I want you to look at your hand.
[3:27:21.200 --> 3:27:23.200]  It's just a mass of energy.
[3:27:23.200 --> 3:27:27.200]  It looks like a solid object, but it is an energy field.
[3:27:27.200 --> 3:27:29.200]  And ask yourself this question.
[3:27:29.200 --> 3:27:31.200]  Can I feel the energy in my hand?
[3:27:31.200 --> 3:27:33.200]  Can I feel the life in my hand?
[3:27:33.200 --> 3:27:35.200]  Can I feel spirit in my hand?
[3:27:35.200 --> 3:27:37.200]  Don't ask your mind that question.
[3:27:37.200 --> 3:27:40.200]  But I invite you to take a breath.
[3:27:40.200 --> 3:27:44.200]  The number one thing they don't want you to do is ever take a breath, right?
[3:27:44.200 --> 3:27:48.200]  Because they need to keep the nervous system in a state of constant flux.
[3:27:48.200 --> 3:27:52.200]  Because when the nervous system is in a state of constant flux, they win.
[3:27:52.200 --> 3:27:53.200]  They control.
[3:27:53.200 --> 3:27:57.200]  See if you can feel the energy in your hand.
[3:27:57.200 --> 3:28:01.200]  And when you feel the energy in your hand, you wake up to the fact that you aren't a body.
[3:28:01.200 --> 3:28:04.200]  There was a time in my life where I said, if somebody said, who am I, I would say,
[3:28:04.200 --> 3:28:08.200]  well, my name is Jake Ducey, I'm 200 pounds, I have blue eyes, this is who I am.
[3:28:08.200 --> 3:28:09.200]  That's not who I am.
[3:28:09.200 --> 3:28:12.200]  It's like saying that I am my fingernail.
[3:28:12.200 --> 3:28:19.200]  So then it opens this door where you may have thought powerless with what's occurring.
[3:28:19.200 --> 3:28:21.200]  You may have felt powerless.
[3:28:21.200 --> 3:28:23.200]  You may have felt like you couldn't do anything about it.
[3:28:23.200 --> 3:28:28.200]  I'm here to tell you, you can do more than you could possibly imagine.
[3:28:28.200 --> 3:28:30.200]  Do it for your family.
[3:28:30.200 --> 3:28:31.200]  Do it for me.
[3:28:31.200 --> 3:28:33.200]  Do it for my daughter.
[3:28:33.200 --> 3:28:36.200]  Do it for your grandchildren that aren't even born yet.
[3:28:36.200 --> 3:28:40.200]  Do it for every person in your community when this happens.
[3:28:40.200 --> 3:28:42.200]  And we realize how powerful we are.
[3:28:42.200 --> 3:28:44.200]  They cannot control us.
[3:28:44.200 --> 3:28:46.200]  So please do me a favor.
[3:28:46.200 --> 3:28:49.200]  Go to resetwars.com right now and sign up.
[3:28:49.200 --> 3:28:51.200]  That's resetwars.com.
[3:28:51.200 --> 3:28:52.200]  Open up your phone.
[3:28:52.200 --> 3:28:53.200]  Open up a new tab.
[3:28:53.200 --> 3:28:55.200]  Go to resetwars.com.
[3:28:55.200 --> 3:28:57.200]  You know, listen, let's go ahead and take another call.
[3:28:57.200 --> 3:28:59.200]  Let's talk to Malcolm in Tennessee.
[3:28:59.200 --> 3:29:00.200]  Welcome.
[3:29:00.200 --> 3:29:01.200]  Hello, Alex.
[3:29:01.200 --> 3:29:02.200]  Yes, Malcolm.
[3:29:02.200 --> 3:29:05.200]  It's quick and real short where the other patrons can get on the line.
[3:29:05.200 --> 3:29:10.200]  Alex, I have to promote one thing from one of your co-hosts, Owen Schreuer.
[3:29:10.200 --> 3:29:13.200]  Supermell Vitality and Brainforce Plus.
[3:29:13.200 --> 3:29:14.200]  Mix those two together.
[3:29:14.200 --> 3:29:16.200]  You're an unstoppable tank.
[3:29:16.200 --> 3:29:18.200]  Supermell Vitality really, really works.
[3:29:18.200 --> 3:29:22.200]  It's cold pressed herbs and natural compounds that have never been heated up.
[3:29:22.200 --> 3:29:27.200]  And so it has a dramatic effect compared to powdered versions.
[3:29:27.200 --> 3:29:29.200]  They also work quite well, but just aren't as strong.
[3:29:29.200 --> 3:29:31.200]  This is like a very fine wine.
[3:29:31.200 --> 3:29:33.200]  In fact, each batch is different.
[3:29:33.200 --> 3:29:34.200]  Sometimes it's super strong.
[3:29:34.200 --> 3:29:35.200]  Sometimes it's just okay.
[3:29:35.200 --> 3:29:39.200]  People are like, why are you selling something and admitting sometimes the batch isn't strong?
[3:29:39.200 --> 3:29:40.200]  That's just how it is.
[3:29:40.200 --> 3:29:41.200]  It's how it works.
[3:29:41.200 --> 3:29:43.200]  So it's always good.
[3:29:43.200 --> 3:29:45.200]  It's just sometimes it's like super strong.
[3:29:45.200 --> 3:29:49.200]  But yeah, if you want the Rolls Royce at a decent price, then this is it.
[3:29:55.200 --> 3:29:59.200]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, keep us on air.
[3:29:59.200 --> 3:30:02.200]  We'll continue to bring you the band guests.
[3:30:02.200 --> 3:30:06.200]  We'll continue to bring the information that no one else will touch.
[3:30:06.200 --> 3:30:07.200]  Keep us on air.
[3:30:07.200 --> 3:30:08.200]  Go to infowarstore.com.
[3:30:08.200 --> 3:30:12.200]  The new supplements that we have, the latest in the Infowars Life Supplement line.
[3:30:12.200 --> 3:30:14.200]  The vitamin D3 with calcium gummies.
[3:30:14.200 --> 3:30:17.200]  The vitamin C with zinc from the Whole Food Multivitamins.
[3:30:17.200 --> 3:30:21.200]  Or if you buy the Combo Pack with all three at infowarstore.com.
[3:30:21.200 --> 3:30:27.200]  And you know, I'm telling you, the vitamin D gummies, this is a great thing for your kids.
[3:30:27.200 --> 3:30:28.200]  They're going to love it.
[3:30:28.200 --> 3:30:29.200]  They're going to love the taste of the gummies.
[3:30:29.200 --> 3:30:30.200]  It's healthy.
[3:30:30.200 --> 3:30:32.200]  So that's just a great thing for kids.
[3:30:32.200 --> 3:30:34.200]  I mean, we could just do marketing campaigns.
[3:30:34.200 --> 3:30:36.200]  I think for kids that'd be great.
[3:30:36.200 --> 3:30:37.200]  Calcium good for them.
[3:30:37.200 --> 3:30:38.200]  The vitamin D.
[3:30:38.200 --> 3:30:41.200]  So that's at infowarstore.com.
[3:30:41.200 --> 3:30:44.200]  And again, it's your support there that keeps us on the air.
[3:30:44.200 --> 3:30:49.200]  So the supplements, the shirts, the air filters, the water filters, the emergency food supplies,
[3:30:49.200 --> 3:30:52.200]  the emergency supplies at infowarstore.com.
[3:30:52.200 --> 3:30:54.200]  Your support there keeps us on the air.
[3:30:54.200 --> 3:30:57.200]  We cannot thank you enough.
[3:31:24.200 --> 3:31:28.200]  And one big thing you can do to fight back is to get high quality Faraday cages,
[3:31:28.200 --> 3:31:31.200]  many of which are made here in America and are very compliant,
[3:31:31.200 --> 3:31:35.200]  meaning U.S. government military grade at infowarstore.com.
[3:31:35.200 --> 3:31:41.200]  We have the entire line of silent pocket ready to ship to you when you visit infowarstore.com.
[3:31:41.200 --> 3:31:43.200]  Again, we have big backpacks.
[3:31:43.200 --> 3:31:44.200]  We have special dry bags.
[3:31:44.200 --> 3:31:46.200]  We've got them for cell phones.
[3:31:46.200 --> 3:31:47.200]  We've got them for laptops.
[3:31:47.200 --> 3:31:48.200]  We've got them for iPads.
[3:31:48.200 --> 3:31:51.200]  It's all there at infowarstore.com.
[3:31:51.200 --> 3:31:56.200]  So protect your privacy today and support the infowar at infowarstore.com.
[3:32:21.200 --> 3:32:23.200]  Don't let the Mexican government take over.
[3:32:23.200 --> 3:32:26.200]  I actually buy this from the Mexican Rebels and I've been buying it for, what, 14 years
[3:32:26.200 --> 3:32:27.200]  and the price has never gone up.
[3:32:27.200 --> 3:32:31.200]  The same stuff's sold at Whole Foods under another name for about 50% more per pound
[3:32:31.200 --> 3:32:34.200]  and I just think it's some of the best coffee you're going to find anywhere.
[3:32:34.200 --> 3:32:38.200]  It's Wake Up America Patriot Blend from the Chiapas Rebels, literally.
[3:32:38.200 --> 3:32:40.200]  In fact, I'm not going to tell you a little story.
[3:32:40.200 --> 3:32:44.200]  We had like that.
[3:32:44.200 --> 3:32:45.200]  You wouldn't believe it.
[3:32:45.200 --> 3:32:50.200]  Anyway, so it's infowarstore.com and that's how we fund this operation.
[3:32:50.200 --> 3:32:57.200]  And if you don't find us and don't want to share, that's fine.
[3:32:57.200 --> 3:33:10.200]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[3:33:10.200 --> 3:33:18.200]  Infowars, Tomorrow's News Today.
[3:33:18.200 --> 3:33:24.200]  We just got word that the early bird signups newsletter was just sent out and there was
[3:33:24.200 --> 3:33:32.200]  a massive, massive, massive flood of traffic to the resetwars.com website.
[3:33:32.200 --> 3:33:38.200]  So we want to thank you for that because we've already had these attacks on many, many, many
[3:33:38.200 --> 3:33:42.200]  of our operating systems and softwares before we got out.
[3:33:42.200 --> 3:33:44.200]  It's obvious they don't want this information out.
[3:33:44.200 --> 3:33:48.200]  So you have any trouble with load time, anything like that, bear with us.
[3:33:48.200 --> 3:33:53.200]  You want to go there now because we're doing a 48-hour 25% off.
[3:33:53.200 --> 3:33:55.200]  Yeah, you can get 25% off.
[3:33:55.200 --> 3:34:01.200]  But what's a lot worse than not saving the 25% is literally not being able to get this.
[3:34:01.200 --> 3:34:05.200]  It's a genuine concern of ours is that this will go down.
[3:34:05.200 --> 3:34:07.200]  This website will go down.
[3:34:07.200 --> 3:34:09.200]  Now, here's the best part.
[3:34:09.200 --> 3:34:17.200]  When you go to resetwars.com right now, you click the button to join and you support Infowars
[3:34:17.200 --> 3:34:19.200]  financially and join.
[3:34:19.200 --> 3:34:21.200]  You get the files immediately.
[3:34:21.200 --> 3:34:23.200]  You get the course immediately.
[3:34:23.200 --> 3:34:25.200]  So if they shut this thing down, you're good.
[3:34:25.200 --> 3:34:26.200]  You have it.
[3:34:26.200 --> 3:34:32.200]  And so that's why I say what's a lot worse than not just, you get 25% off, it's amazing.
[3:34:32.200 --> 3:34:36.200]  But what would be a lot worse is literally not being able to get this course in 72 hours,
[3:34:36.200 --> 3:34:38.200]  is that it's not available.
[3:34:38.200 --> 3:34:40.200]  And we're seeing that.
[3:34:40.200 --> 3:34:49.200]  I mean, I don't even know why, but for whatever reason, they threw me into their pit of attacks
[3:34:49.200 --> 3:34:55.200]  in their vice article claiming I'm some kind of a hypnotist or something like that.
[3:34:55.200 --> 3:34:56.200]  That's not what we're doing.
[3:34:56.200 --> 3:34:59.200]  We're exposing how they've built this system.
[3:34:59.200 --> 3:35:02.200]  And so if you're just joining here, my name is Jake Ducey.
[3:35:02.200 --> 3:35:06.200]  I'm filling in for Alex today on the Alex Shun Show in the final hour here.
[3:35:06.200 --> 3:35:12.200]  And I'm filling in in honor of his new course, his new program, and that is Reset Wars.
[3:35:12.200 --> 3:35:17.200]  Reset Wars is a step-by-step system, breaking down the nature of reality,
[3:35:17.200 --> 3:35:24.200]  breaking down your connection to God's spirit, and how, most importantly, we defeat the great reset.
[3:35:24.200 --> 3:35:28.200]  And one of the chapters that I really love, it's a shorter chapter in the course,
[3:35:28.200 --> 3:35:30.200]  because I got to watch this whole thing be filmed.
[3:35:30.200 --> 3:35:37.200]  I got to watch this course in addition to it being filmed live another six, seven times, something like that.
[3:35:37.200 --> 3:35:41.200]  And one of my favorite parts is called Beyond the Great Reset, right?
[3:35:41.200 --> 3:35:43.200]  We know what the great reset is.
[3:35:43.200 --> 3:35:44.200]  We hear about it all the time.
[3:35:44.200 --> 3:35:45.200]  Alex talks about it all the time.
[3:35:45.200 --> 3:35:47.200]  I don't need to come on and discuss it.
[3:35:47.200 --> 3:35:52.200]  But one of the things just to show you that this is things you're never going to hear on the show,
[3:35:52.200 --> 3:35:54.200]  things broken down in a way like never before.
[3:35:54.200 --> 3:35:57.200]  We're probably going to have like Klaus Schwab open up his credit card,
[3:35:57.200 --> 3:36:02.200]  and he's going to be like, oh, they're talking Beyond the Great Reset chapter two.
[3:36:02.200 --> 3:36:04.200]  Shut website down instantly.
[3:36:04.200 --> 3:36:06.200]  So this is why you want to sign up for this right away.
[3:36:06.200 --> 3:36:08.200]  This is why you want to join to this right now.
[3:36:08.200 --> 3:36:10.200]  You want to open up another tab.
[3:36:10.200 --> 3:36:13.200]  I know you might be driving in a car, or you might be doing something,
[3:36:13.200 --> 3:36:16.200]  or you might just like, you're not sure if you want to buy it.
[3:36:16.200 --> 3:36:20.200]  First of all, it's 100% money back guaranteed.
[3:36:20.200 --> 3:36:25.200]  Second of all, open up another tab in your phone or in your computer right now,
[3:36:25.200 --> 3:36:28.200]  and go to resetwars.com, hit the Join Now button,
[3:36:28.200 --> 3:36:32.200]  and become a part of what we're doing, because this is how we win, right?
[3:36:32.200 --> 3:36:34.200]  This is how we win.
[3:36:34.200 --> 3:36:39.200]  And speaking of Klaus Schwab, who's probably sitting there watching the chapters,
[3:36:39.200 --> 3:36:41.200]  trying to figure out how to take it down.
[3:36:41.200 --> 3:36:43.200]  Once he comes across chapter two, he's not going to like it,
[3:36:43.200 --> 3:36:46.200]  because Alex breaks down in a way that I've really never heard.
[3:36:46.200 --> 3:36:50.200]  You know, sometimes you get glimpses of Alex like this in a Joe Rogan episode or something,
[3:36:50.200 --> 3:36:53.200]  but it's off the cuffs, and they're having fun.
[3:36:53.200 --> 3:36:57.200]  This is thousands of hours of research put together
[3:36:57.200 --> 3:37:02.200]  and organized in a manner that you can directly apply into your life.
[3:37:02.200 --> 3:37:08.200]  And the chapter Beyond the Great Reset says basically what he does is he breaks down how,
[3:37:08.200 --> 3:37:11.200]  why is all of this occurring, right?
[3:37:11.200 --> 3:37:16.200]  Of course, it's because they want control, but much deeper than that.
[3:37:16.200 --> 3:37:23.200]  And he talks about how all of it is designed, whether it's the shots,
[3:37:23.200 --> 3:37:27.200]  whether it's the metaverse,
[3:37:27.200 --> 3:37:31.200]  whether it's the fourth industrial revolution and transhumanism.
[3:37:31.200 --> 3:37:38.200]  It's all designed to alter your spiritual and physical DNA and your connection to God, right?
[3:37:38.200 --> 3:37:42.200]  Because the point is, trap you in the metaverse, so you sit there,
[3:37:42.200 --> 3:37:47.200]  and you duct-tape this metaverse thing on. Mark Zuckerberg never wants you to take it off,
[3:37:47.200 --> 3:37:50.200]  and you sit there, and you're in your metaverse, and you're sitting there,
[3:37:50.200 --> 3:37:54.200]  and you only get to stop when he feeds you some ground-up cricket protein powder, right?
[3:37:54.200 --> 3:37:57.200]  And he wants us to stay in that forever, right?
[3:37:57.200 --> 3:37:59.200]  The shots, right?
[3:37:59.200 --> 3:38:02.200]  We've even had Forbes came out last week, and they said,
[3:38:02.200 --> 3:38:07.200]  well, actually, this does modify your DNA, but ever so slightly,
[3:38:07.200 --> 3:38:10.200]  and it's good for you, just like they now say inflation is good for you.
[3:38:10.200 --> 3:38:14.200]  That was like a Forbes article, I believe, where they said, yes, these shots do modify your DNA.
[3:38:14.200 --> 3:38:16.200]  So what is it all for?
[3:38:16.200 --> 3:38:19.200]  It's because it's designed to disconnect you from your spiritual identity.
[3:38:19.200 --> 3:38:21.200]  Why did they hate Jesus?
[3:38:21.200 --> 3:38:24.200]  Well, because Jesus was showing people how to wake up,
[3:38:24.200 --> 3:38:27.200]  because Jesus was saying, hey, I'm in this world, but not out of it,
[3:38:27.200 --> 3:38:29.200]  and when you realize you're in this world, but not out of it,
[3:38:29.200 --> 3:38:32.200]  the control systems of this world cannot control you anymore,
[3:38:32.200 --> 3:38:35.200]  which is why they burned the books, which is why they deleted parts of the Bible,
[3:38:35.200 --> 3:38:37.200]  which is why they didn't like Jesus,
[3:38:37.200 --> 3:38:45.200]  and which is why they tried to shut down reset wars before it even came out.
[3:38:45.200 --> 3:38:49.200]  And I'm not comparing Alex Jones to Jesus,
[3:38:49.200 --> 3:38:54.200]  but what I am saying is it's the same game.
[3:38:54.200 --> 3:38:57.200]  Once we realize we're in this world, but not out of it,
[3:38:57.200 --> 3:39:00.200]  and once we realize we're living on three planes of existence,
[3:39:00.200 --> 3:39:02.200]  and Alex breaks all of this down in the course,
[3:39:02.200 --> 3:39:05.200]  open up a tab right now on your phone,
[3:39:05.200 --> 3:39:10.200]  and type in resetwars.com, open up a tab on your browser right now,
[3:39:10.200 --> 3:39:14.200]  another tab, and go to resetwars.com, and sign up right now.
[3:39:14.200 --> 3:39:16.200]  There's literally no risk whatsoever.
[3:39:16.200 --> 3:39:18.200]  It's 100% money back guaranteed.
[3:39:18.200 --> 3:39:22.200]  I'm the one taking the risk here, because I'm coming on air,
[3:39:22.200 --> 3:39:25.200]  and I know I'll have some nice articles written about me here very shortly,
[3:39:25.200 --> 3:39:27.200]  some nice pleasant ones.
[3:39:27.200 --> 3:39:30.200]  But this is how we win, guys.
[3:39:30.200 --> 3:39:32.200]  This is how we win.
[3:39:32.200 --> 3:39:37.200]  And so Alex breaks down all of this stuff
[3:39:37.200 --> 3:39:40.200]  that you will never hear anywhere else beyond the great reset.
[3:39:40.200 --> 3:39:43.200]  We exist on three planes, and he breaks that all down.
[3:39:43.200 --> 3:39:46.200]  We exist on the physical plane, the mental-emotional plane,
[3:39:46.200 --> 3:39:50.200]  which is the emotional control grid, the coin that he termed...
[3:39:50.200 --> 3:39:53.200]  excuse me, the term that he coined in the course,
[3:39:53.200 --> 3:39:57.200]  the emotional control grid, which is the mental and emotional plane,
[3:39:57.200 --> 3:39:59.200]  because everything's energy.
[3:39:59.200 --> 3:40:04.200]  So the mental is the energy waves of consciousness,
[3:40:04.200 --> 3:40:08.200]  and the emotional plane is emotion, energy, and motion.
[3:40:08.200 --> 3:40:10.200]  He breaks down what is an emotion.
[3:40:10.200 --> 3:40:12.200]  It's energy and motion in the course.
[3:40:12.200 --> 3:40:16.200]  So you exist on the physical plane, the mental and emotional,
[3:40:16.200 --> 3:40:19.200]  which is where they try to trap us into the emotional control grid.
[3:40:19.200 --> 3:40:22.200]  Even when we're awake, even when we know what's happening,
[3:40:22.200 --> 3:40:24.200]  we're still trapped in the emotional control grid.
[3:40:24.200 --> 3:40:26.200]  He shows how to break out of it.
[3:40:26.200 --> 3:40:29.200]  The last is you exist on the spiritual plane,
[3:40:29.200 --> 3:40:31.200]  and this is why they're rushing out the metaverse.
[3:40:31.200 --> 3:40:34.200]  This is why they're rushing out the shots and now admitting,
[3:40:34.200 --> 3:40:36.200]  yes, it does alter your DNA,
[3:40:36.200 --> 3:40:39.200]  because they need to alter your DNA to control you.
[3:40:39.200 --> 3:40:41.200]  And they're not just going to do it with shots,
[3:40:41.200 --> 3:40:43.200]  they're going to do it with everything.
[3:40:43.200 --> 3:40:46.200]  And this is why the whole endgame of this whole system,
[3:40:46.200 --> 3:40:52.200]  endgame, the most popular term in Infowars, endgame,
[3:40:52.200 --> 3:40:54.200]  Alex's most famous documentary ever,
[3:40:54.200 --> 3:40:58.200]  the endgame is to trap you in a physical body
[3:40:58.200 --> 3:41:02.200]  and disconnect you entirely from higher spiritual energy.
[3:41:02.200 --> 3:41:09.200]  So the course breaks down how do you connect back to that power?
[3:41:09.200 --> 3:41:14.200]  In the course, he talks about how to look at the word inspiration
[3:41:14.200 --> 3:41:17.200]  as being in spirit.
[3:41:17.200 --> 3:41:21.200]  When you're connected to God, when you're connected to God's will for you,
[3:41:21.200 --> 3:41:26.200]  and you're no longer controlled by the lower emotional control grid emotions,
[3:41:26.200 --> 3:41:30.200]  fear, doubt, worry, am I powerful enough to do something about it?
[3:41:30.200 --> 3:41:31.200]  Because that's what happens.
[3:41:31.200 --> 3:41:33.200]  We don't think we can do something about it.
[3:41:33.200 --> 3:41:36.200]  So we sit here, we watch Alex, we learn everything that's happening,
[3:41:36.200 --> 3:41:42.200]  but then the next step is to realize you can be just as or more powerful than Alex,
[3:41:42.200 --> 3:41:45.200]  or just as or more powerful than Dr. Zelinko,
[3:41:45.200 --> 3:41:49.200]  or just as or more powerful than Joe Rogan, Mike Adams,
[3:41:49.200 --> 3:41:54.200]  Jonathan Isaac on the Orlando Magic, whatever it is,
[3:41:54.200 --> 3:41:57.200]  this is how we win and this is the game.
[3:41:57.200 --> 3:42:00.200]  So I can tell you honestly, from the bottom of my heart,
[3:42:00.200 --> 3:42:02.200]  this is the greatest thing Alex has ever created.
[3:42:02.200 --> 3:42:05.200]  And I can say as no type of gimmick,
[3:42:05.200 --> 3:42:09.200]  we really do not know how long this is going to be available.
[3:42:09.200 --> 3:42:14.200]  It was very ironic that Elon Musk's tweets about your mind as a firewall
[3:42:14.200 --> 3:42:20.200]  and your mind as a software came out 24 hours after Alex and I aired a segment about it.
[3:42:20.200 --> 3:42:22.200]  These are very specific terms.
[3:42:22.200 --> 3:42:24.200]  Your mind is a mental firewall.
[3:42:24.200 --> 3:42:26.200]  It's obvious Elon Musk is watching this.
[3:42:26.200 --> 3:42:28.200]  It's obvious Elon Musk knows what's happening.
[3:42:28.200 --> 3:42:31.200]  And what else is obvious is that they prepared for this.
[3:42:31.200 --> 3:42:38.200]  They launched that vice article attacking reset wars just 48 hours before the course came out.
[3:42:38.200 --> 3:42:41.200]  So we don't know how long this is going to be up.
[3:42:41.200 --> 3:42:46.200]  We had issues with some of our softwares terminating us before.
[3:42:46.200 --> 3:42:47.200]  We don't know.
[3:42:47.200 --> 3:42:51.200]  So I want to encourage you to go to resetwars.com right now, open up a tab, open up a browser.
[3:42:51.200 --> 3:43:20.200]  It's resetwars.com and sign up right now.
[3:43:22.200 --> 3:43:25.200]  It is the true digital economy.
[3:43:25.200 --> 3:43:30.200]  It's the spiritual economy of the mind and transcend their control.
[3:43:30.200 --> 3:43:34.200]  I've been on there 28 years and all of our work has been amazing.
[3:43:34.200 --> 3:43:38.200]  Thanks to God and God's divine empowerment and blessing.
[3:43:38.200 --> 3:43:42.200]  But I got to tell you out of everything I've done, reset wars is the most important.
[3:43:42.200 --> 3:43:46.200]  And it is now available out of the month of December 20.
[3:43:46.200 --> 3:43:49.200]  We want us here at resetwars.com.
[3:43:49.200 --> 3:43:53.200]  Start your journey to the next level today at resetwars.com.
[3:43:53.200 --> 3:43:56.200]  The globalist fear this information.
[3:43:58.200 --> 3:44:02.200]  I want to explain something that is absolutely key to understanding our world.
[3:44:02.200 --> 3:44:05.200]  It's very, very simple, but the most of all don't know.
[3:44:05.200 --> 3:44:14.200]  The privately owned central banks of the world are artificially creating thousands of trillions of dollars and other major currencies.
[3:44:14.200 --> 3:44:21.200]  And using them to buy up infrastructure, intellectual property, energy.
[3:44:21.200 --> 3:44:24.200]  They're using it to buy people, to buy influence.
[3:44:24.200 --> 3:44:30.200]  And in the past they created thousands of trillions so that they could leverage that manipulate markets.
[3:44:30.200 --> 3:44:35.200]  But they never allowed that money to get into the general circulation or it would cause massive inflation.
[3:44:35.200 --> 3:44:41.200]  Now they've gone ahead and weaponized it and are flooding every sector of the world economy buying up everything.
[3:44:41.200 --> 3:44:47.200]  Not to have the companies operate, but to actually shut them down and force a collapse of civilization.
[3:44:47.200 --> 3:44:51.200]  Making the companies they do fund be the only things left standing.
[3:44:51.200 --> 3:44:53.200]  This is the great reset. This is what's happening now.
[3:44:53.200 --> 3:44:56.200]  Warn everyone. It's the only way to stop it.
[3:44:58.200 --> 3:45:00.200]  Get our great bag of it here.
[3:45:00.200 --> 3:45:05.200]  I mean this is from, people say, why is it from Chiapas, Mexico, the communists?
[3:45:05.200 --> 3:45:12.200]  Well that's where some of the best coffee in the world that's wild harvested, above organic, in the volcanic soil, better than Guatemalan coffee.
[3:45:12.200 --> 3:45:17.200]  And yeah, we buy it from the little farmers that, you know, the media calls communists, but really they're just a commune.
[3:45:17.200 --> 3:45:20.200]  And whatever the point is, is that it's good coffee and we've got it.
[3:45:20.200 --> 3:45:22.200]  And the farmers don't let the Mexican government take over.
[3:45:22.200 --> 3:45:27.200]  So I actually buy this from the Mexican rebels and I've been buying it for what, 14 years and the price has never gone up.
[3:45:27.200 --> 3:45:31.200]  The same stuff sold at Whole Foods under another name for about 50% more per pound.
[3:45:31.200 --> 3:45:35.200]  And I just think it's some of the best coffee you're going to find anywhere.
[3:45:35.200 --> 3:45:38.200]  It's Wake Up America, Patriot Blend from the Chiapas rebels, literally.
[3:45:38.200 --> 3:45:41.200]  Um, in fact, I'm not going to tell you a little story.
[3:45:41.200 --> 3:45:44.200]  Um, we had one too.
[3:45:44.200 --> 3:45:46.200]  Okay, you wouldn't believe it.
[3:45:46.200 --> 3:45:50.200]  Anyway, so it's infowarstore.com and that's how we fund this operation.
[3:45:50.200 --> 3:46:02.200]  And if you don't find us and don't want to share, that's fine.
[3:46:21.200 --> 3:46:31.200]  I also need you to wear masks and I also need you to only shop at mega corporations.
[3:46:31.200 --> 3:46:42.200]  That way we can consolidate control and bankrupt the world economy, leaving companies that only I own profitable.
[3:46:42.200 --> 3:46:50.200]  You will then be my slaves. And then you'll get that special shot of freedom from Cobra.
[3:46:50.200 --> 3:47:12.200]  We'll remove your immune system so you'll be dependent on me for the rest of your miserable lives.
[3:47:12.200 --> 3:47:14.200]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones show.
[3:47:14.200 --> 3:47:19.200]  I am Jake Ducey filling in for the final hour here on the Alex Jones show.
[3:47:19.200 --> 3:47:24.200]  And I'm doing that in honor of Alex's new online course that is Reset Wars.
[3:47:24.200 --> 3:47:26.200]  But this is more than a course.
[3:47:26.200 --> 3:47:30.200]  This is the exact enemy playbook that Alex has been studying for 28 years.
[3:47:30.200 --> 3:47:37.200]  He codified it, he broke it down, and he gives you exactly how to reverse engineer it into your life to improve your finances,
[3:47:37.200 --> 3:47:41.200]  to, uh, defeat the great reset, to break out of the mind control system,
[3:47:41.200 --> 3:47:45.200]  and to, I think, most importantly, spiritually awake.
[3:47:45.200 --> 3:47:47.200]  And I think that's how we really win.
[3:47:47.200 --> 3:47:51.200]  And so I want you to open up your browser right now, a new tab on your desktop and your phone.
[3:47:51.200 --> 3:47:55.200]  Go to resetwars.com. It is officially live. It is officially available.
[3:47:55.200 --> 3:47:59.200]  You can move through Reset Wars right now.
[3:47:59.200 --> 3:48:04.200]  So that's resetwars.com. We've already had, as we mentioned, numerous attacks,
[3:48:04.200 --> 3:48:08.200]  whether it's been attacks on our software, whether it's been some media attacks that were,
[3:48:08.200 --> 3:48:11.200]  seem to be planted in advance knowing that this is coming out,
[3:48:11.200 --> 3:48:14.200]  which makes me go, well, are they monitoring some of our systems?
[3:48:14.200 --> 3:48:20.200]  I mean, we know our biggest threat with this course is going to be keeping it on air.
[3:48:20.200 --> 3:48:24.200]  And that's why I'm encouraging you right now. You get 25% off, you go sign up right now.
[3:48:24.200 --> 3:48:26.200]  25% off, you sign up right now.
[3:48:26.200 --> 3:48:33.200]  But more than the 25% off discount is the, the, the worst situation is if you don't sign up right now
[3:48:33.200 --> 3:48:37.200]  and they shut this down, you're going to get access to this immediately.
[3:48:37.200 --> 3:48:42.200]  And even if they're able to successfully shut this down in the future, you will still have everything.
[3:48:42.200 --> 3:48:48.200]  So that's resetwars.com. So let me just break down a little bit of, of how this even came to be.
[3:48:48.200 --> 3:48:54.200]  So what happened was I was coming to interview Alex totally separately.
[3:48:54.200 --> 3:48:58.200]  And I just said to him, Hey, you know, I love your show. I love everything you're doing.
[3:48:58.200 --> 3:49:02.200]  I love everything you stand for. And I think it's important what you're doing.
[3:49:02.200 --> 3:49:09.200]  And I think there's so much more depth to you and you've learned so much,
[3:49:09.200 --> 3:49:15.200]  whether it's secrets of success. I mean, this is a guy that recorded in his closet
[3:49:15.200 --> 3:49:18.200]  and then became one of the most powerful people in the world.
[3:49:18.200 --> 3:49:21.200]  So if you think whether it's you're starting music from ground zero,
[3:49:21.200 --> 3:49:24.200]  you're starting your entrepreneurial endeavors from ground zero,
[3:49:24.200 --> 3:49:28.200]  whether you think you're trying to start your own medical practice from ground zero,
[3:49:28.200 --> 3:49:33.200]  or maybe you've been inspired by God to do it, but then you feel afraid and you're unsure.
[3:49:33.200 --> 3:49:37.200]  Right. Because I believe that God's all calling us to do something bigger.
[3:49:37.200 --> 3:49:41.200]  Well, Alex is someone that went in from his closet,
[3:49:41.200 --> 3:49:44.200]  becoming the most one of the most powerful people in America,
[3:49:44.200 --> 3:49:46.200]  one of the most feared and revered people in America.
[3:49:46.200 --> 3:49:51.200]  You're going to learn the exact step-by-step process, exercises,
[3:49:51.200 --> 3:49:56.200]  mindsets, tools that Alex was able to use so you can apply them into your life.
[3:49:56.200 --> 3:50:01.200]  Not just so you can defeat Klaus Schwab, but so you can radically change your personal life.
[3:50:01.200 --> 3:50:03.200]  It's resetwars.com to sign up.
[3:50:03.200 --> 3:50:06.200]  And you're going to learn all types of amazing things that you've never heard.
[3:50:06.200 --> 3:50:10.200]  I had no idea when I was watching this course recorded live.
[3:50:10.200 --> 3:50:14.200]  I didn't know that Alex was just a little kid in middle school that decided one day
[3:50:14.200 --> 3:50:18.200]  he was going to go on the radio and defeat all these people and reach millions of people.
[3:50:18.200 --> 3:50:23.200]  I mean, it's a perfect example of just having an inspired vision and then being able to implement it.
[3:50:23.200 --> 3:50:25.200]  And that's what you and I need to be doing.
[3:50:25.200 --> 3:50:28.200]  And so you're going to learn all these amazing stories additionally,
[3:50:28.200 --> 3:50:32.200]  things like I learned that when he was starting his career,
[3:50:32.200 --> 3:50:35.200]  or when he first decided he wanted to do radio, right?
[3:50:35.200 --> 3:50:38.200]  There was a local contest in Austin Radio.
[3:50:38.200 --> 3:50:40.200]  He was in middle school and they said,
[3:50:40.200 --> 3:50:45.200]  well, cut a one hour show, submit it to this radio station with your own ads,
[3:50:45.200 --> 3:50:47.200]  and we'll pick a winner.
[3:50:47.200 --> 3:50:51.200]  So Alex does his own mock show as a middle school kid,
[3:50:51.200 --> 3:50:55.200]  submits it, and then is waiting to hear if he won.
[3:50:55.200 --> 3:50:57.200]  Oh my gosh, am I going to win? Am I going to win?
[3:50:57.200 --> 3:51:03.200]  And the big radio announcer on local TV pulls up Alex's radio show
[3:51:03.200 --> 3:51:06.200]  and ends up just making fun of him for the whole day.
[3:51:06.200 --> 3:51:10.200]  Going through all of his clips, look at this idiot, look at this idiot.
[3:51:10.200 --> 3:51:15.200]  And that was where he started becoming the person that he is today.
[3:51:15.200 --> 3:51:18.200]  And so you're going to learn some amazing stories like that that you never heard before,
[3:51:18.200 --> 3:51:22.200]  but it's not because it's just like about Alex.
[3:51:22.200 --> 3:51:26.200]  The reason that this is so important is because once we internalize this,
[3:51:26.200 --> 3:51:29.200]  once you move through this course, when you find your favorite chapter,
[3:51:29.200 --> 3:51:32.200]  when you find your favorite section, you watch it again three more times.
[3:51:32.200 --> 3:51:38.200]  He's going to give you some very powerful secret exercises and tools
[3:51:38.200 --> 3:51:40.200]  that you can actually do.
[3:51:40.200 --> 3:51:42.200]  Like, this isn't just theory.
[3:51:42.200 --> 3:51:47.200]  And when you do them, I mean, this is why they're trying to shut this down in advance.
[3:51:47.200 --> 3:51:50.200]  And so anyways, this is how this all came out to be,
[3:51:50.200 --> 3:51:53.200]  is I said to him when I was just interviewing,
[3:51:53.200 --> 3:51:55.200]  hey, you know, you should do something like this.
[3:51:55.200 --> 3:52:00.200]  And he said, well, maybe we should call it reset wars.
[3:52:00.200 --> 3:52:03.200]  And I said, yeah, you should do it.
[3:52:03.200 --> 3:52:10.200]  And he said, well, could you just give me, you know, some bouncing walls
[3:52:10.200 --> 3:52:13.200]  so I could throw some ideas off you.
[3:52:13.200 --> 3:52:19.200]  And all of a sudden, next thing you know, Alex has went to a level of depth of research.
[3:52:19.200 --> 3:52:23.200]  Every day you see him with like all these, he's, I got the documents, I got the documents.
[3:52:23.200 --> 3:52:24.200]  Right?
[3:52:24.200 --> 3:52:28.200]  And that's like Alex going on Piers Morgan telling him he's got the documents.
[3:52:28.200 --> 3:52:35.200]  Well, picture all this times a million for the amount of research the entire team put through.
[3:52:35.200 --> 3:52:38.200]  And know that when you join reset wars today,
[3:52:38.200 --> 3:52:43.200]  not only do you have 100% money back guarantee, literally, there's zero risk for you.
[3:52:43.200 --> 3:52:45.200]  There's zero risk for you.
[3:52:45.200 --> 3:52:48.200]  And you may be like, I'm not sure I want it.
[3:52:48.200 --> 3:52:56.200]  Well, your son might, your daughter might, your cousin might, your best friend might need it.
[3:52:56.200 --> 3:53:01.200]  And so I said, Alex, you're inspiring all these people with the news.
[3:53:01.200 --> 3:53:04.200]  You're covering all these amazing details of what's happening.
[3:53:04.200 --> 3:53:08.200]  And I said, well, what about there's one more layer for us to win.
[3:53:08.200 --> 3:53:11.200]  We inform everyone, we put the whole system together,
[3:53:11.200 --> 3:53:16.200]  everything you do already on this, on this amazing Info Wars team and all the other shows you guys do.
[3:53:16.200 --> 3:53:21.200]  Well, the next level is let's teach people everything that you learned.
[3:53:21.200 --> 3:53:27.200]  And about 10 years ago, he tried to write a book with the very famous Neil Strauss,
[3:53:27.200 --> 3:53:30.200]  the guy that wrote all those huge New York Times bestsellers.
[3:53:30.200 --> 3:53:33.200]  And he was going to break down the secret history of the world.
[3:53:33.200 --> 3:53:37.200]  Well, turns out the editor that approved that project got fired.
[3:53:37.200 --> 3:53:42.200]  They shut down the entire project and they were afraid of that type of stuff going out.
[3:53:42.200 --> 3:53:47.200]  Well, now imagine how much more powerful this information is today.
[3:53:47.200 --> 3:53:52.200]  That's what Reset Wars is. That's what Reset Wars is all about.
[3:53:52.200 --> 3:53:58.200]  And that's why they try to shut this down in advance because they don't want it out.
[3:53:58.200 --> 3:54:05.200]  And every day, you know, I run across talking to people and people say, we're screwed.
[3:54:05.200 --> 3:54:07.200]  And I don't think we are.
[3:54:07.200 --> 3:54:10.200]  I think all of this is happening so that we wake up.
[3:54:10.200 --> 3:54:12.200]  I think you chose to be here for a reason.
[3:54:12.200 --> 3:54:15.200]  I don't know what your reason is, but your reason is different than mine.
[3:54:15.200 --> 3:54:22.200]  You have no idea I'd be sitting here on air guest hosting the fourth hour of Alex Jones' show.
[3:54:22.200 --> 3:54:24.200]  And you have no idea where God is going to push you.
[3:54:24.200 --> 3:54:29.200]  But if you accept the free will to not just be informed of what's happening,
[3:54:29.200 --> 3:54:35.200]  but to go from learning it to living it, that's when the game changes.
[3:54:35.200 --> 3:54:39.200]  Right? Because Jesus didn't just say, hey, there's evil forces.
[3:54:39.200 --> 3:54:43.200]  He didn't just say, here's what's going on.
[3:54:43.200 --> 3:54:46.200]  He said, well, here's the key to totally break out of the system.
[3:54:46.200 --> 3:54:49.200]  You're in this world, but not of it.
[3:54:49.200 --> 3:54:57.200]  And tyranny is always designed to keep you trapped into the physical world.
[3:54:57.200 --> 3:55:00.200]  It is always designed to keep you as Alex.
[3:55:00.200 --> 3:55:01.200]  Well, that's right, Jake.
[3:55:01.200 --> 3:55:06.200]  And I was in there working on stuff, eating lunch, watching you do a great job.
[3:55:06.200 --> 3:55:09.200]  For Owen takes over here in just like three minutes, four minutes.
[3:55:09.200 --> 3:55:14.200]  But guess what we just learned while I was in Rob Do's office eating lunch and watching you.
[3:55:14.200 --> 3:55:16.200]  What's that?
[3:55:16.200 --> 3:55:23.200]  Hillary Clinton has a multi-thousand dollar masterclass, which is, you know, four or five, six times what we're charging,
[3:55:23.200 --> 3:55:26.200]  teaching people that men are the problem.
[3:55:26.200 --> 3:55:34.200]  It actually says how to overcome the resilience of the male hierarchy and how horrible men are.
[3:55:34.200 --> 3:55:39.200]  So teaching a bunch of women to be victims and hate the other side of humanity when we have that magic,
[3:55:39.200 --> 3:55:42.200]  literal union of men and women coming together that God created.
[3:55:42.200 --> 3:55:44.200]  Imagine how satanic that is.
[3:55:44.200 --> 3:55:48.200]  So here we have, of course, using the MK Ultra program, how to break out of it,
[3:55:48.200 --> 3:55:51.200]  exposing the whole system, invaluable information listeners.
[3:55:51.200 --> 3:55:52.200]  I don't BS you, you know this.
[3:55:52.200 --> 3:55:57.200]  For literally 200-something bucks that we put so much into with a team of over 40 people involved
[3:55:57.200 --> 3:56:00.200]  and a whole new system launching from it.
[3:56:00.200 --> 3:56:01.200]  And then we went and read the synopsis.
[3:56:01.200 --> 3:56:02.200]  We got to do a thing on this.
[3:56:02.200 --> 3:56:08.200]  Hillary Clinton has a multi-thousand dollar masterclass, bitching for five hours about how much men suck
[3:56:08.200 --> 3:56:12.200]  when she helped run giant pedophile rings for other people and raping women en masse.
[3:56:12.200 --> 3:56:14.200]  I mean, this is unbelievable.
[3:56:14.200 --> 3:56:18.200]  So, folks, we want to make this the number one self-help class out there.
[3:56:18.200 --> 3:56:20.200]  I guarantee you compared to everything else, it's next level.
[3:56:20.200 --> 3:56:22.200]  Nobody's ever done this.
[3:56:22.200 --> 3:56:24.200]  It is resetwars.com.

[3:56:34.200 --> 3:56:36.200]  and want to thank you all for your support.
[3:56:36.200 --> 3:56:37.200]  Here's what we got to do.
[3:56:37.200 --> 3:56:39.200]  Hillary Clinton's got that coming out.
[3:56:39.200 --> 3:56:41.200]  We got to beat Hillary Clinton.
[3:56:41.200 --> 3:56:46.200]  If you want to take down the globalists, if you want to show them how powerful this movement of awakening really is,
[3:56:46.200 --> 3:56:48.200]  let's just put it right in their face.
[3:56:48.200 --> 3:56:52.200]  You know Hillary's going to be on all these shows and they're going to be talking up her courses
[3:56:52.200 --> 3:56:56.200]  and how great they are, and it's just designed to put you right back into the control system.
[3:56:56.200 --> 3:57:01.200]  Even if you were unsure about getting this before, go to resetwars.com right now.
[3:57:01.200 --> 3:57:04.200]  Let's show Hillary Clinton that we can sell more courses than her.
[3:57:04.200 --> 3:57:10.200]  Let's show Hillary Clinton that we can put together an actual system that's not going to show you how to be a victim.
[3:57:10.200 --> 3:57:17.200]  This is the actual keys of consciousness and the keys of the universe designed to help all of us.
[3:57:17.200 --> 3:57:22.200]  No, no, I'm going to take to Hillary how to be a demon globalist course for $3,000.
[3:57:22.200 --> 3:57:27.200]  Unbelievable, man. It's okay. I'm sorry.
[3:57:27.200 --> 3:57:30.200]  Jake, you're going to be back with us tomorrow, host of the fourth hour again.

[3:59:14.200 --> 3:59:15.200]  They recommend it to everybody.
[3:59:15.200 --> 3:59:16.200]  You're on the fence about it.

[3:59:18.200 --> 3:59:19.200]  Support the infowar.
[3:59:19.200 --> 3:59:20.200]  Tyler in Maine.
[3:59:20.200 --> 3:59:21.200]  You're on the air.
[3:59:21.200 --> 3:59:22.200]  Thanks for rolling. Go ahead.
[3:59:22.200 --> 3:59:24.200]  Hey Alex, it's great to be on with you. It's an honor.
[3:59:24.200 --> 3:59:25.200]  Honor, talk to you.
[3:59:25.200 --> 3:59:26.200]  Awesome.
[3:59:26.200 --> 3:59:30.200]  So first thing I wanted to do was say I love the products.
[3:59:30.200 --> 3:59:32.200]  Alpha Power, even at 29.
[3:59:32.200 --> 3:59:34.200]  If you ask my better half, she loves it.
[3:59:34.200 --> 3:59:36.200]  And it helps in the bedroom.
[3:59:36.200 --> 3:59:38.200]  So just number one for a few of us there.
[3:59:38.200 --> 3:59:40.200]  It only works. It's not a joke.
[3:59:40.200 --> 4:00:09.200]  Absolutely.
