[00:00.000 --> 00:26.000]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:26.000 --> 00:35.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're live.
[00:35.000 --> 00:37.000]  We're broadcasting worldwide.
[00:37.000 --> 00:39.000]  We're going to be here for the next four hours.
[00:39.000 --> 00:40.000]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[00:40.000 --> 00:45.000]  I intend to open the phones up again today on the 28th of September, 2017.
[00:45.000 --> 00:46.000]  Wow.
[00:46.000 --> 00:54.000]  Trump has really delivered in his proposed tax cut once in a lifetime plan as he dubbed it yesterday.
[00:54.000 --> 00:58.000]  He's airing his remarks coming up later in the hour.
[00:58.000 --> 01:00.000]  Getting rid of the estate tax.
[01:00.000 --> 01:01.000]  Beautiful.
[01:01.000 --> 01:03.000]  Absolutely amazing.
[01:03.000 --> 01:12.000]  That will energize so much more money, not going into the government coffers, but going back out into private hands.
[01:12.000 --> 01:15.000]  Going from seven tax rates down to three.
[01:15.000 --> 01:21.000]  Cutting taxes massively on the middle class and poor people.
[01:21.000 --> 01:26.000]  There's talk of tax increases on the wealthy.
[01:26.000 --> 01:32.000]  At the same time, cutting corporate tax from 35 to 20.
[01:32.000 --> 01:36.000]  And that will bring back in trillions of dollars outside of the country.
[01:36.000 --> 01:46.000]  The globalist set our taxes as the highest corporate tax in the world to make it prohibitive to do business in the United States as part of the globalist strategic plan.
[01:46.000 --> 01:48.000]  That's admitted, by the way.
[01:48.000 --> 01:51.000]  So you turn our call back on.
[01:51.000 --> 01:54.000]  You cut the corporate tax to be competitive.
[01:54.000 --> 01:55.000]  He wanted it lower than China.
[01:55.000 --> 01:58.000]  It's now basically right at the same rate as China.
[01:58.000 --> 02:01.000]  If we even get this cut.
[02:01.000 --> 02:08.000]  So yes, China, the communist, have a lower corporate tax rate than the so-called capitalist.
[02:08.000 --> 02:12.000]  You heard that right.
[02:12.000 --> 02:15.000]  So we're going to be walking through all of this today.
[02:15.000 --> 02:29.000]  Also, more and more Congress and the Attorney General are closing in on the Clinton crimes as they try to bring down Trump for made up garbage lawmakers set sites on Obama and the unmasking scandal.
[02:29.000 --> 02:35.000]  Also, there's reports that Anthony Weiner is frightened of prison beat down because of pedophile label.
[02:35.000 --> 02:37.000]  Oh, the pedophile label.
[02:37.000 --> 02:39.000]  Just look at Anthony Weiner.
[02:39.000 --> 02:40.000]  He doesn't.
[02:40.000 --> 02:43.000]  He's not just a convicted sex crimes individual.
[02:43.000 --> 02:53.000]  He looks like what you would imagine in your nightmares as the kind of person that talks to kids, you know, about getting in their car at the playground.
[02:53.000 --> 03:00.000]  I'm not saying Weiner ever did what Jerry Epstein his good buddy did or what Bill Clinton has been reportedly connected to.
[03:00.000 --> 03:01.000]  Oh, no.
[03:01.000 --> 03:13.000]  Or comedy central making jokes that I say the Clintons are into voodoo. They just say it into other books and all over the news and go down and take part in voodoo rituals.
[03:13.000 --> 03:16.000]  But see, they're not the weird ones for doing that.
[03:16.000 --> 03:20.000]  I'm the weird one for reporting on it.
[03:20.000 --> 03:21.000]  That's right.
[03:21.000 --> 03:29.000]  If I go to some place in the Pacific Ocean and show you aborigines that headhunt and eat people.
[03:29.000 --> 03:32.000]  I'm the weird one for reporting on it.
[03:32.000 --> 03:38.000]  Not the New Guinea headhunters.
[03:38.000 --> 03:40.000]  See how that works?
[03:40.000 --> 03:44.000]  If I bust Jeffrey Dahmer kidnapping people and eating them.
[03:44.000 --> 03:47.000]  I'm the bad one, not Jeffrey Dahmer.
[03:47.000 --> 03:49.000]  So if I report.
[03:49.000 --> 03:52.000]  All the Clinton voodoo garbage.
[03:52.000 --> 04:01.000]  Well, just have comedy central come out with their new fake news show and just say that I made it up and then don't show where I showed all the proof.
[04:01.000 --> 04:03.000]  And I haven't gotten around to going after that show.
[04:03.000 --> 04:04.000]  It's on five nights a week.
[04:04.000 --> 04:07.000]  I've only watched five minutes of it to be honest with you.
[04:07.000 --> 04:12.000]  And I just can't even bring myself to watch it, but I'm going to try as best I can.
[04:12.000 --> 04:15.000]  Because when you look at it, they say we stand for nothing.
[04:15.000 --> 04:16.000]  We believe in nothing.
[04:16.000 --> 04:18.000]  No, that's you the mercenary global.
[04:18.000 --> 04:19.000]  It's not us.
[04:19.000 --> 04:28.000]  And just keep acting like you're the big intellectuals and you're the big smart guys and keep making fun of grassroots citizens, you know, for quote, reporting from their living rooms.
[04:28.000 --> 04:36.000]  That's all like one minute of what they had last night, making fun of people because they go, we're the news reporting from our living room.
[04:36.000 --> 04:46.000]  As if people giving their views, their opinions or video taping events that happened or going to their city hall aren't as important as the dirt bags at Viacom.
[04:46.000 --> 04:51.000]  So just keep telling us how you're the establishment and that we're idiots.
[04:51.000 --> 04:54.000]  But you're fighting the establishment because you're the resistance.
[04:54.000 --> 04:56.000]  Everyone sees through your garbage.
[04:56.000 --> 04:58.000]  We'll be back.
[05:01.000 --> 05:07.000]  You know, someone very profoundly once said many years ago that if fascism ever comes to America, it'll come in the name of liberalism.
[05:07.000 --> 05:09.000]  You're a white male.
[05:09.000 --> 05:11.000]  You're a white man.
[05:11.000 --> 05:20.000]  Welcome to the war room, the latest expansion in Info Wars live broadcasting.
[05:20.000 --> 05:29.000]  We are live weekdays from three to six p.m. central at info wars.com slash so and this YouTube channel right here that you've landed on.

[05:32.000 --> 05:35.000]  You can follow us on Twitter at war room show.
[05:35.000 --> 05:43.000]  We are going to have the most powerful guests, the most powerful hosts will be hearing from Alex Jones regularly as well as taking your phone calls.
[05:43.000 --> 05:47.000]  The liberal establishment media has controlled the narrative for too long.
[05:47.000 --> 05:50.000]  The silent majority is no longer silent.
[05:50.000 --> 05:52.000]  This is the war room.
[05:52.000 --> 06:12.000]  We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own four years of seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature to detoxify the body.
[06:12.000 --> 06:17.000]  That's why I'm introducing Z Shield, toxic metal and chemical defense support.
[06:17.000 --> 06:25.000]  It's made in the USA. It's filled with known compounds from nature that are absolutely associated with detoxifying the body and it supports the Info War.
[06:25.000 --> 06:27.000]  It is a classical 360 win.
[06:27.000 --> 06:37.000]  This is the formula that I personally have been taking for over a year and now we believe we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly get.
[06:37.000 --> 06:48.000]  You owe it to yourself, you owe it to your family and you owe it to the future of this country in the world that patriots stay as healthy and as clean and as focused as you can be because we need you.
[06:48.000 --> 06:54.000]  The remnant of America to reignite those brush fires the next level and to be healthy and as focused as you can be.
[06:54.000 --> 06:57.000]  Thanks to your support and your prayers together we're changing the world.
[06:57.000 --> 07:08.000]  Now it's time to change our bodies with Z Shield InfoWarsLive.com.
[07:27.000 --> 07:35.000]  Pure organic plant extracts are concentrated containing antibacterial properties that work well to help tone gums and freshen your breath.
[07:35.000 --> 07:38.000]  This antiseptic mouthwash is a concentrated formula.
[07:38.000 --> 07:42.000]  You will need to dilute one part mouthwash to 10 varts water.
[07:42.000 --> 07:47.000]  Imrex Essentials mouthwash is a great addition to your daily brushing routine.
[07:47.000 --> 07:52.000]  It is effective yet gentle enough for the most sensitive gums and canker sores.
[07:52.000 --> 07:54.000]  Go organic today with Imrex Essentials.
[07:54.000 --> 07:57.000]  Visit infowarsstore.com to learn more.
[07:57.000 --> 08:26.000]  Let's infowarsstore.com.
[08:27.000 --> 08:49.000]  Today is the 28th day of September 2017.
[08:49.000 --> 08:52.000]  Again this year is already very long on the tooth.
[08:52.000 --> 08:54.000]  Seems like it just got here doesn't it?
[08:54.000 --> 09:13.000]  We have the Navy machinist who years ago took a picture of himself inside a nuclear submarine and served a year in prison for doing one millionth what Hillary Clinton did.
[09:13.000 --> 09:19.000]  And it became a big national topic back during the campaign when Trump brought it up.
[09:19.000 --> 09:25.000]  He's now asking the president for a pardon. I think it's a great way to bring up the fact that Hillary got away with what she did.
[09:25.000 --> 09:30.000]  He shouldn't get in trouble when it wasn't meant to endanger US national security.
[09:30.000 --> 09:35.000]  He's going to be joining us for 30 minutes start of the next hour.
[09:35.000 --> 09:41.000]  But before we go any further I'll also have open phones throughout the transmission.
[09:41.000 --> 09:49.000]  We also have real tyranny unfolding in Catalan in what is northeastern Spain.
[09:49.000 --> 09:53.000]  Catalan police ordered to close polling stations to stop vote.
[09:53.000 --> 10:00.000]  Spanish central government shutting down secession that is wildly popular over 80%.
[10:00.000 --> 10:02.000]  So there's no way to stop that.
[10:02.000 --> 10:05.000]  People will separate themselves just like Brexit.
[10:05.000 --> 10:10.000]  They may fail in this round but the very oppression itself will trigger.
[10:10.000 --> 10:14.000]  The corrupt Spanish socialist government's defeat.
[10:14.000 --> 10:23.000]  It is the socialist policies that have angered Catalonians who are classically conservative, very Christian, that are against the Islamic invasion as well.
[10:23.000 --> 10:31.000]  And they produce even though they're only like 15% of the population, 40% of the wealth and taxes of Spain.
[10:31.000 --> 10:34.000]  And it's always been that way.
[10:34.000 --> 10:41.000]  Now with more than 92% of votes in Iraq, Kurdistan is backing independence as well.
[10:41.000 --> 10:48.000]  And Turkey's dictator is threatening a military invasion or to cut off their food as well.
[10:48.000 --> 10:52.000]  That's been an historically pro-Christian area of the Muslim world.
[10:52.000 --> 10:56.000]  All the military I've talked to, the Kurds are good people, continually being bullied by all sides.
[10:56.000 --> 11:00.000]  They deserve their own country but Turkey's threatening a full-on invasion.
[11:00.000 --> 11:02.000]  So we're going to look at that as well.
[11:02.000 --> 11:04.000]  A lot happening with the economy.
[11:04.000 --> 11:08.000]  Also the New York Times, this came out a few days ago and I missed it.
[11:08.000 --> 11:13.000]  And one of the producers, Matt, said, you know, Daria pointed this out, you really ought to cover it.
[11:13.000 --> 11:16.000]  And they're right. Why I admire Anthony Weiner.
[11:16.000 --> 11:19.000]  I didn't say that before the news clips that.
[11:19.000 --> 11:22.000]  That is the New York Times.
[11:22.000 --> 11:26.000]  That's a convicted child sex crime operative.
[11:26.000 --> 11:30.000]  That is a guy connected to huge pedophile rings and they love him and they admire him.
[11:30.000 --> 11:32.000]  Poor baby in the New York Times.
[11:32.000 --> 11:37.000]  I'm going to tie that in with some other reports that deal with this.
[11:37.000 --> 11:44.000]  Because Comedy Central has a new show that attacks me daily, five days a week, called The Establishment.
[11:44.000 --> 11:50.000]  I mean, what it is, is it's The Establishment trying to pose as the resistance, claiming that we are The Establishment and they're The Resistance.
[11:50.000 --> 11:56.000]  But it's the big Viacom company that promotes the sexualization of children on Nickelodeon, MTV, you name it.
[11:56.000 --> 12:00.000]  Some of the Redstone's wicked outfit, weaponized television.
[12:00.000 --> 12:04.000]  They have this new ridiculous transmission called The Opposition.
[12:04.000 --> 12:10.000]  And in there, they make fun of me saying that the Clintons are involved in voodoo.
[12:10.000 --> 12:13.000]  That was their opening salvo a few nights ago.
[12:13.000 --> 12:15.000]  I haven't watched it since then.
[12:15.000 --> 12:18.000]  And it's just every second is bull.
[12:18.000 --> 12:25.000]  I mean, I have the Washington Post, the New York Times, saying that the Clintons are engaging voodoo.
[12:25.000 --> 12:27.000]  There it is, Washington Post.
[12:27.000 --> 12:31.000]  The time Bill and Hillary Clinton went to a voodoo ceremony in Haiti.
[12:31.000 --> 12:34.000]  But it wasn't like they went there as anthropologists or sociologists.
[12:34.000 --> 12:36.000]  They partake in it.
[12:36.000 --> 12:39.000]  I've got articles out of the LA Times 20 years ago with Hillary doing it.
[12:39.000 --> 12:42.000]  I've got one of her best friends saying they kill people with hexes.
[12:42.000 --> 12:44.000]  Breitbart reports on that.
[12:44.000 --> 12:48.000]  They're into the occult, skull and bones, bohemian grove, both parties.
[12:48.000 --> 12:51.000]  It's a fact.
[12:51.000 --> 12:54.000]  So we're going to expose that coming up.
[12:54.000 --> 13:01.000]  We're going to expose that to the Hollywood stars saying they were doing hexes on Trump and calling for him to die.
[13:01.000 --> 13:04.000]  I'm not the fruit loop that's calling for this.
[13:04.000 --> 13:08.000]  They're the fruit loops that believe in it.
[13:08.000 --> 13:10.000]  They're the ones doing it.
[13:10.000 --> 13:14.000]  We're reporting on you, the little pseudo intellectuals.
[13:14.000 --> 13:16.000]  So we're going to be breaking it down.
[13:16.000 --> 13:22.000]  And in past times, when I report on them attacking me, they do copyright strikes directly from Viacom saying,
[13:22.000 --> 13:25.000]  I can't even play clips of these dirt bags and respond to them.
[13:25.000 --> 13:27.000]  Well, you know what?
[13:27.000 --> 13:32.000]  While you chicken neck pseudo intellectuals, we're going to do it.
[13:32.000 --> 13:35.000]  All right, let's get into the big meat potatoes issue.
[13:35.000 --> 13:37.000]  Tax reform.
[13:37.000 --> 13:44.000]  I have the United Unified Framework for fixing our broken tax code from El Presidente.
[13:44.000 --> 13:51.000]  And if he can actually get this through, it would turn the entire economy and this nation around.
[13:51.000 --> 13:55.000]  The problem is, once it gets to Congress, they're going to monkey you.
[13:55.000 --> 14:00.000]  And they're even talking about trying to raise taxes hijacking this plan and they'll blame Trump.
[14:00.000 --> 14:05.000]  No, this plan is excellent, especially if you freeze spending increases.
[14:05.000 --> 14:07.000]  This would pay down the debt very quickly.
[14:07.000 --> 14:11.000]  The problem is they cut taxes and then they increase spending as well.
[14:11.000 --> 14:14.000]  You have to stop the spending increases.
[14:14.000 --> 14:20.000]  And then you've got to trim the bad areas of government and you've got to then turn loose the power of the American people.
[14:20.000 --> 14:27.000]  So they got the Goldman Sachs Trump advisor already on TV saying he can't guarantee they won't raise it on the middle class.
[14:27.000 --> 14:30.000]  Well, the tax plan says the only race tax is on the rich.
[14:30.000 --> 14:36.000]  Well, the way this is written, it gets rid of the loophole so the really rich can't get out of it.
[14:36.000 --> 14:43.000]  And so I'm all for it, ladies and gentlemen, turn loose the poor folks working class, the middle class, get rid of the estate tax.
[14:43.000 --> 14:52.000]  That's a nod to wealthy as well as poor and help this country get back on what made us great, low taxes, low regulations.
[14:52.000 --> 14:59.000]  But let's hear from some of the president's speech last night when he announced a lot of this. Here it is.
[14:59.000 --> 15:07.000]  This is a once in a generation opportunity and I guess it's probably something I could say that I'm very good at.
[15:07.000 --> 15:10.000]  I've been waiting for this for a long time.
[15:10.000 --> 15:19.000]  We're going to cut taxes for the middle class, make the tax code simpler and more fair for everyday Americans,
[15:19.000 --> 15:29.000]  and we are going to bring back the jobs and wealth that have left our country and most people thought left our country for good.
[15:29.000 --> 15:48.000]  We want tax reform that is pro-growth, pro-jobs, pro-worker, pro-family and yes, tax reform that is pro-American.
[15:48.000 --> 16:13.000]  It's time to take care of our people, to rebuild our nation and to fight for our great American workers.
[16:13.000 --> 16:23.000]  Indiana is a tremendous example of the prosperity that is unleashed when we cut taxes and set free the dreams of our citizens.
[16:23.000 --> 16:41.000]  This state has claimed a powerful competitive edge built on low taxes and less regulation and are we cutting regulation.
[16:41.000 --> 16:45.000]  Businesses all across the country have taken notice.
[16:45.000 --> 16:52.000]  In recent years, Indiana has welcomed dozens of companies fleeing high taxes and high tax states.
[16:52.000 --> 17:01.000]  Thousands of new jobs and massive capital investment have followed, meaning a better quality of life for the people of Indiana.
[17:01.000 --> 17:11.000]  All of this is possible because the people of this state have made a decision. They chose to make Indiana competitive again.
[17:11.000 --> 17:21.000]  They chose, and their choice was so important, it included electing a governor who you may have heard of,
[17:21.000 --> 17:47.000]  who signed the largest income tax cut in the state's history, our very, very terrific person and terrific Vice President, Mike Pence.
[17:47.000 --> 17:52.000]  It's time for Washington to learn from the wisdom of Indiana.
[17:52.000 --> 17:59.000]  We need Washington to promote American jobs instead of obstructing them.
[17:59.000 --> 18:04.000]  That is what I've been working to achieve every day since I took office.
[18:04.000 --> 18:08.000]  That is what I talked about on the campaign trail.
[18:08.000 --> 18:22.000]  Already, we're seeing the results of an economic policy that finally puts America first.
[18:22.000 --> 18:26.000]  Unemployment is at a 16-year low.
[18:26.000 --> 18:41.000]  Unemployment for African Americans is near its lowest point since the turn of the millennium. It's really a fantastic thing to see.
[18:41.000 --> 18:49.000]  Wages are rising. Optimism among manufacturers has reached all-time highs.
[18:49.000 --> 19:02.000]  GDP growth last quarter reached 3% way ahead of schedule. Nobody thought that was going to happen for a long time.
[19:02.000 --> 19:08.000]  And this quarter, I believe, would have been better, but the hurricanes will have an impact.
[19:08.000 --> 19:12.000]  But other than that, it would have been, in my opinion, even better.
[19:12.000 --> 19:29.000]  Your government is working for you, once again, not for the donors, not the special interest, but the hard-working, tax-paying citizens of our country.
[19:29.000 --> 19:33.000]  America is back on the right track, and I see so many red hats.
[19:33.000 --> 19:42.000]  Make America great again. That's what we're doing. Make America great again.
[19:42.000 --> 19:56.000]  But our country and our economy cannot take off like they should unless we dramatically reform America's outdated, complex, and extremely burdensome tax code.
[19:56.000 --> 20:04.000]  Right. It's designed to keep us down. We'll be right back with more and Congressman's Collease back to Congress.

[21:10.000 --> 21:20.000]  Well, the Fed is raising rates here and now. There has never been a better time to turn your IRA or 401K into physical gold or silver with GSI exchange.

[21:59.000 --> 22:05.000]  It's been said any society has only three missed meals away from chaos. Those times may be near.
[22:05.000 --> 22:15.000]  Think about it, our country faces multiple terrorist threats and aggressions from Russia and North Korea. Social unrest and violent marches yet again may lead to looting of stores and city shutdowns.
[22:15.000 --> 22:21.000]  And our crumbling infrastructure leaves our power grid vulnerable to long-term outages from a single cyber attack.
[22:21.000 --> 22:28.000]  When the chaos from any one of these threats arises the government knows it can't provide during a widespread national emergency.

[23:21.000 --> 23:38.000]  You've heard the phrase, you are what you eat, not true. Actually, you are what you can't absorb. So if the vitamins and supplements you now take are not being absorbed, what good are they?

[23:58.000 --> 24:21.000]  Alex Jones here, back live, Louisiana Congressman Steve Scalise. After months and months and months of recovery that he almost didn't make it back from, he's now had his return to Congress today.
[24:21.000 --> 24:31.000]  And he again had to go back into the hospital repeatedly because of infections. He was shot by a high caliber rifle, along with several other people obviously.
[24:31.000 --> 24:40.000]  When a madman, the CNN basically said it was a hero who wasn't a terrorist, went looking for Republicans to kill.
[24:40.000 --> 24:53.000]  And then top Democratic strategist celebrated it and they said that we need to go out and hunt Republicans. Hashtag hunt Republicans. Truly sickening group of people.
[24:53.000 --> 25:01.000]  But he has returned to Congress for TV viewers. We're rolling some video of that. Let's hear what Fox News had to say.
[25:01.000 --> 25:12.000]  I can't hear words but what we can see in the center of our screen is a man who spent a lot of time in ICU and on life support walking down a hallway with some aid there and with a little bit of a limp.
[25:12.000 --> 25:23.000]  But Steve Scalise is back in the house and he's already met today with House Speaker Paul Ryan. Paul Ryan said a few moments ago when asked how that meeting went that he was brought to tears.
[25:23.000 --> 25:36.000]  He said, I'm no John Boehner. I was babbling. I was crying hard. I have no words to describe it. Let's listen to the applause.
[25:36.000 --> 25:38.000]  So that's Fox News coverage of it.
[25:38.000 --> 25:49.000]  So Sandra, this is a monumental day not only for him but for others who have been recovering from that and for the members there in the chamber to be able to be with him and give him support.
[25:49.000 --> 25:55.000]  This is his first public appearance since that shooting at the Congressional Baseball practice.
[25:55.000 --> 25:59.000]  And of course a lot of Democrats have been hoping that he would die publicly.
[25:59.000 --> 26:09.000]  And then when one mentally ill person runs over a poor young lady, all conservatives and all libertarians are at fault even though we're not calling for violence.
[26:09.000 --> 26:14.000]  But the Democrats call for violence and then they're good when it happens.
[26:14.000 --> 26:20.000]  And then CNN has guessed on saying the shooter wasn't evil, was just fed up with Trump.
[26:20.000 --> 26:23.000]  What's going to happen if folks go, hey are those CNN reporters?
[26:23.000 --> 26:28.000]  And then shoot a bunch of them and say, hey, I'm not evil. I don't want that to happen.
[26:28.000 --> 26:38.000]  CNN's already politically dead, just like MSNBC, just like Nickelodeon, just like Viacom, just like Comedy Central, just like all the dirtbacks.
[26:38.000 --> 26:45.000]  People are aware of who they are. We're breaking with them. The NFL's committed suicide. All these parasitic groups are on their knees.
[26:45.000 --> 26:51.000]  So let them be violent. Bring them to justice. We're not the violent ones. They know it. They can't stand it.
[26:51.000 --> 26:55.000]  And I'm telling you, the next card they're going to play is false flag yet again.
[26:55.000 --> 26:58.000]  But no matter what they do, the American people see through it.
[26:58.000 --> 27:07.000]  Now here is a sneak peek of Congressman Scalise giving 60 minutes the first interview and it's coming up this Sunday.
[27:07.000 --> 27:11.000]  So here's a first look with that interview.
[27:11.000 --> 27:28.000]  It was just after 7 a.m. on June 14th at a ballpark in Alexandria, Virginia, when a team made up of Republican congressmen went from shagging balls to dodging bullets.
[27:28.000 --> 27:38.000]  That guy was Congressman Steve Scalise. This cell phone video was among the first images of him that day.
[27:38.000 --> 27:48.000]  Last was him being wheeled on a gurney to a helicopter, clinging to life. He spent most of the next four days unconscious.
[27:48.000 --> 28:04.000]  I found out later just how much damage was done internally. My femur was shattered. The hip and pelvis had serious damage where the bullet went through and did some damage to areas that had to be short up with steel plates.
[28:04.000 --> 28:15.000]  And they did a phenomenal job of rebuilding Humpty Dumpty. There was a lot of damage inside that had to get fixed.
[28:15.000 --> 28:19.000]  They put you back together again.
[28:19.000 --> 28:24.000]  60 minutes is one of the only mainstream media outlets that still has giant audiences.
[28:24.000 --> 28:28.000]  Megan Kelly destroyed the NBC program she was on, now she's destroying.
[28:28.000 --> 28:34.000]  The morning show she has horrible ratings, horrible critics reviews, just unwatchable crap.
[28:34.000 --> 28:45.000]  Her worshipping, the total failure joke, Jane Fonda, Hanoi Jane. These people just don't get it. We're rejecting them all.
[28:45.000 --> 28:52.000]  But I understand why he's going to 60 minutes. They're going to make a softball interview about how he survived and what a great story that is and probably have a little bit of anti-gun stuff mixed in.
[28:52.000 --> 28:59.000]  Not from Scalise, but from 60 minutes. And I really wish folks more and more would just not even give 60 minutes the time of day.
[28:59.000 --> 29:06.000]  But they're not as vicious as some of the other magazine shows and it's why people still watch it.
[29:06.000 --> 29:12.000]  It still has some aura of being a real investigative report. And the others don't.
[29:12.000 --> 29:19.000]  But they still color manipulated Stephen Bannon. They still let him from below, just like NBC did me.
[29:19.000 --> 29:25.000]  They just can't help the dirty tricks. But we'll see if they do those to Scalise.
[29:25.000 --> 29:31.000]  But again, 60 minutes is an example to all the other establishment media.
[29:31.000 --> 29:39.000]  Don't be so obvious about it and people would still watch you. But they don't want to be beat over the head by your anti-American crap.
[29:39.000 --> 29:44.000]  But hey, you're not going to listen. I'm not going to interrupt our enemies as they are destroying themselves.
[29:44.000 --> 29:51.000]  More on the big tax cut plans, Obamacare and more. They're saying he's going to kill it with an executive order. That's Trump.
[29:51.000 --> 29:56.000]  They're saying he's going to kill it with an executive order. That's Obamacare.
[30:21.000 --> 30:27.000]  Let the heart of the conflict, the more glorious the triumph. What we obtain too cheap, we esteem too lightly.
[30:27.000 --> 30:33.000]  It is dearness only that gives everything its value. Heaven knows how to put a proper price on its goods.
[30:33.000 --> 30:39.000]  And it would be strange indeed if so celestial an article as freedom should not be highly rated.
[30:39.000 --> 30:47.000]  Britain, with an army to enforce her tyranny, has declared that she has a right not only to tax, but to bind us in all cases whatsoever.
[30:47.000 --> 30:52.000]  And if being bound in that matter is not slavery, then there is no such thing as slavery upon Earth.
[30:52.000 --> 30:58.000]  Even the expression is impious, for so unlimited a power can only belong to God.
[30:58.000 --> 31:21.000]  Thomas Paine, The American Crisis.
[31:28.000 --> 31:33.000]  Through the best job you can to purify your air, the elite are masters at poisoning our environment,
[31:33.000 --> 31:40.000]  while themselves doing things that mitigate or avoid most toxic effects for themselves. The general public doesn't.
[31:40.000 --> 31:48.000]  The elects of pure breeze would be a steel at $300, $400, $500. One of these systems can keep 800 square feet incredibly clean.
[31:48.000 --> 31:55.000]  This is a system I'm personally putting in throughout my house, replacing older, more expensive filters that didn't do as good a job.
[31:55.000 --> 32:01.000]  Find out why this system is so revolutionary today at infowarstore.com.
[32:01.000 --> 32:09.000]  I am very proud to announce the introduction of the highest quality info wars, biome defense probiotic.
[32:09.000 --> 32:23.000]  We wanted to come out with the largest spectrum of high quality known probiotics that have been proven to improve overall digestion and health and detoxification in the body.
[32:23.000 --> 32:35.000]  Biome defense is an exclusive blend of 50 billion live and active cultures from over 23 different probiotic strains that are known to support digestion and intestinal function.
[32:35.000 --> 32:42.000]  Our researchers are confident that we have been able to develop what will be the leading probiotic on the market.

[32:51.000 --> 33:01.000]  We've been testing this formula for years, but this is the limited first round of the public, so please take advantage of it today, support your own health and support the info war.
[33:21.000 --> 33:48.000]  I am so happy that Congressman Scalise lived.
[33:48.000 --> 33:55.000]  When I saw the thousands of tweets, I mean hundreds of pages of them and prominent people saying they hoped he died.
[33:55.000 --> 34:09.000]  And when I watched mainstream corporate media be completely silent about all the viciousness and actually witness CNN and others talking about how the guy that attacked him did what had to be done,
[34:09.000 --> 34:20.000]  it just makes you realize that these globalists have been dominating and parasitically controlling America and feeding off Americans, these different elites,
[34:20.000 --> 34:28.000]  while they try to domesticate as many Americans as they can to make us controllable so the parasite can control the host.
[34:28.000 --> 34:48.000]  They want to turn more people into parasites, so it becomes more of a symbiotic parasitic relationship where we can't live without the parasitic controllers because they've so infected us with their political and economic and cultural and religious satanic systems.
[34:48.000 --> 35:00.000]  That's how Comedy Central makes fun of me and goes, Jones claims it's a satanic communist world government conspiracy, so which is it? Is it satanic or is it communist? Well, they're one in the same.
[35:00.000 --> 35:11.000]  Dehumanizing people, enslaving them, taking their free will, taking people's labor, giving it to other people, without them being able to direct where it goes, that is satanic.
[35:11.000 --> 35:27.000]  They're one in the same, meaning evil, meaning corrupt, meaning immoral, but again, they play constant, semantical games where they feed on their ignorant viewers, where they think that people aren't intellectually intelligent,
[35:27.000 --> 35:54.000]  and so they create little mental fallacies in the mind and then expand out from there, just burrowing in as much as they can to basically scramble communications and to lessen the larger palette of words
[35:54.000 --> 36:08.000]  that individuals are able to use and communicate with. They're at war with language, they're at war with freedom, they're at war with families, they're at war with independence, they want you to be their captured slaves.
[36:08.000 --> 36:20.000]  And the WikiLeaks and all their documents admit it. I want to get back into the president's tax cut and then, Rand Paul, Trump will take executive action on healthcare after Senate failure, he's come out and said,
[36:20.000 --> 36:37.000]  well, what have we been publishing for eight months that always got to do is not let them raid Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and that if he can stop them from raiding Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the hundreds of billions of dollars a year they used to
[36:37.000 --> 36:52.000]  give up Obamacare that the federal government will not have followed its agreement and the whole thing decouples and implodes. Plus, it's already imploding where many states only have one provider who can then jack up prices as high as they want.
[36:52.000 --> 37:12.000]  That's why on average it's doubled, in some areas it's quadrupled the prices and massively increased profits of insurance companies who wrote it. It's a giant scam. But all the Democrats do is sit back and say,
[37:12.000 --> 37:28.000]  well, we're defeating the Republicans by keeping Obamacare in place like they're winning score points in a baseball game when the Republican elites, the Democratic elites wrote it and it's been a screw job.
[37:28.000 --> 37:51.000]  There's no getting around the fact that Gruber that helped write it said it's a ripoff to triple prices and thank God you're so stupid and thank God you have no attention span. Thank God you're so distracted and I'm up here saying please don't be distracted, please don't be distracted, please don't be distracted, please don't let them screw you over.
[37:51.000 --> 38:07.000]  It's crazy. But Rand Paul predicted Wednesday that President Trump would soon move on his own to make health care insurance more affordable after the Senate failed again this week to advance any bill to reform federal health care policy.
[38:07.000 --> 38:28.000]  Paul said on MSNBC that he thinks Trump would move to reinterpret an existing law in order to make it easier for people by health insurance across state lines. And that of course will let you have competition and will lower prices. What a horrible, greedy, hateful thing Trump is trying to do to take our children's health care
[38:28.000 --> 38:44.000]  and make sure children can't have heart surgery like Jimmy Kimmel says. Just made up, waving a bloody shirt. We deserve free health care like Cuba or England. They don't have free health care. What they don't have is health care. That's why they come here.
[38:44.000 --> 39:01.000]  You pay out 20, 30% of your paycheck into it and then you don't even get it. Oh, but it's free. Oh, but there's a two year wait on that brain surgery. That brain surgery is 99% operable for that tumor. But only within six months, within two years, 90 plus percent of people die.
[39:01.000 --> 39:16.000]  I mean, those are real parliament debates I've watched over and over again where even Tony Blair would admit. Yes, I agree. It's unacceptable that we're making children wait 18 months to two years for the surgery. If not done within six months, normally kills the child.
[39:16.000 --> 39:31.000]  I agree we're going to fix it. But all national health care services is wonderful. Crown of socialism. And then I've got to hear, we deserve free health care just like England. It's not free.
[39:31.000 --> 39:49.000]  Venezuela's got free health care. You can't get it now. It's not free. It's like saying I have a free imaginary cake here and everybody can have a slice of it. They're like imagining you're having it. Oh, is it chocolate cake? Is it vanilla cake?
[39:49.000 --> 40:02.000]  Is it rum raisin cake? Then you're just getting a slice of it in here. Have your imaginary cake. Oh, communism's so good. Socialism. Oh, it's so good. And of course, it always works for a while till you run out of other people's money.
[40:02.000 --> 40:16.000]  And I know our audience knows this. But imagine not being informed and really believing as some trending millennial that watches Jimmy Kimmel that kids with heart defects don't get surgeries.
[40:16.000 --> 40:31.000]  There are hundreds of major charities. The hospitals are supposed to be charity hospitals. You know, when you walk in most hospitals, it says on the on the billboard, Catholics charity or Lutheran charity hospitals were always supposed to be charities.
[40:31.000 --> 40:46.000]  Then the doctors were paid, the nurses were paid, but there was no profit in it. And if someone didn't have money, it was free. And they would check your credit or they would know you were in the standing.
[40:46.000 --> 41:01.000]  And they'd come in and say, your child needs surgery. It's going to be handled by the hospital. But they never tell anyone this. I have a friend who had Crohn's disease.
[41:01.000 --> 41:12.000]  And his insurance kept kicking him off and he couldn't get it through the city of Austin, because the city wouldn't cover it. And I said, under charity care under law, these charity hospitals have to do your surgery.
[41:12.000 --> 41:23.000]  You know, let's say you're making $40,000 a year, which he was the city. And I said that, you know, counts is basically blue collar in a town like this. You can go show them your pay stubs, your taxes, what you've done.
[41:23.000 --> 41:33.000]  And they're going to make you pay a fraction of it. And the hospital will pay for it. And he goes, my doctor tells me that doesn't exist. I said, your doctor's lying to you.
[41:33.000 --> 41:48.000]  He was trying to give him some prescription that cost hundreds of dollars per pill. It's called Remicade. It didn't even work, but it turned his immune system off. And I told my friend, I said, you need to go to the charity hospitals.
[41:48.000 --> 42:02.000]  He goes, well, they don't say charity. I said, they're basically all charity hospitals unless it's a private clinic. And he finally went and they said, yes, we do charity care, but we recommend that you go back to the state you're from for the surgery.
[42:02.000 --> 42:19.000]  He got even better there in New York City. And he went and the top Crohn's surgeon in the world did his surgery. And all he had to pay for was like $500 for the cost of auto-claving and cleaning the instruments.
[42:19.000 --> 42:29.000]  And I mean, he just couldn't believe it. He said he was true. No one would tell me. My dad managed hospitals. My dad managed over 150 dental clinics.
[42:29.000 --> 42:39.000]  Okay, my dad testifies in the legislature and writes papers for Congress. I know, okay, I know all about healthcare, all about it.
[42:39.000 --> 42:48.000]  See, I've already gone off on a jag. It's just, it's so frustrating because under Obamacare, you know what it lets the hospitals do?
[42:48.000 --> 43:13.000]  Get out of the old laws and the old regulations. You know, everybody talks about Ron Paul was such an incredible guy before he retired from being a OBGYN and delivering babies because she would work at least a week out of the month at a charity hospital every night and deliver up to three babies a night for $2 a night.
[43:13.000 --> 43:26.000]  You know why under charity hospitals, they did that. They paid for you to get food at the hospital kitchen and Ron Paul famously would get paid $2 a night.
[43:26.000 --> 43:35.000]  And this was in the 80s in Houston to deliver babies. That was for coffee, water, juice, a hamburger, whatever, $2 a night.
[43:35.000 --> 43:44.000]  And why did Ron Paul go and do that when there wasn't even a law in place? Because when they went to medical school, they told him, this is what you do.
[43:44.000 --> 43:51.000]  One third of your time, it's free. Now, my dad still did that in dentistry and he had a line around the block of people wanting the free dental care.
[43:51.000 --> 44:08.000]  And then the companies he worked for, he'd practiced as well under law, if you manage stuff, you got to practice. So he still practiced two days a week. But he would still say, you know, you have to pay for the actual dentures or the actual pieces that go into your teeth because that has to go to the company.
[44:08.000 --> 44:14.000]  But I'm doing your care for free. And people said, well, we've never heard of this or I used to hear about this, but why doesn't this happen?
[44:14.000 --> 44:26.000]  He said, well, things have changed. That's what you're supposed to do. Rich people are supposed to pay more for health care. They're supposed to endow hospitals. They're supposed to endow public baths.
[44:26.000 --> 44:36.000]  They're supposed to endow bridges. They're supposed to build infrastructure. Oh, but instead we have the federal government to do it and then you don't get it.
[44:36.000 --> 44:50.000]  And so under Obamacare, do you know what you get? You get it written by the insurance companies and big hospital groups to shut down all the small hospital groups, all the clinics, consolidate control.
[44:50.000 --> 45:07.000]  Because under Obamacare, if you don't have lobbyists in Capitol Hill, they swat team raid your hospital and say you're giving out too many opiates or you're not filing stuff right or you're involved in Medicare, Medicaid fraud and shut you down.
[45:07.000 --> 45:18.000]  That's what we live under now is a mafia. And so my dad's gotten out of health care because it's impossible unless you go start paying off the federal regulators and it's all legal.
[45:18.000 --> 45:33.000]  You start going giving money to Congress and going to the meetings in New York and D.C. and Los Angeles and Chicago and meeting around in the big board rooms and meeting around with the regulators and getting on congressional committee advisory boards.
[45:33.000 --> 45:45.000]  You don't exist. You got to go get at the table with the big boys and then no more charity care, no more nothing, gouge everybody, rip everybody off.
[45:45.000 --> 45:58.000]  And then they got the nerve to stick Jimmy Kimmel up there on television to tell you, oh, my son had heart defects, so you're basically killing kids if you get rid of Obamacare.
[45:58.000 --> 46:04.000]  And Jimmy Kimmel just doesn't know the facts. Jimmy Kimmel reads off a teleprompter.
[46:04.000 --> 46:15.000]  Jimmy Kimmel is a funny guy that let him be a comedian. I'm not against Jimmy Kimmel. And I said in a report, I said, I hope that Jimmy Kimmel finds out why congenital heart defects are way up.
[46:15.000 --> 46:30.000]  Just type in Burt defects way up in the West and it's Burt defects of the heart, you name it. And I said, I hope he and his family find out why that's happening and help people find out the cause, chemical runoff, vaccines, you name it, so he can use his platform to stop this.
[46:30.000 --> 46:42.000]  What did the media say? What did George Soros say? What did media matters say? They said that I said I was blaming him for the Burt defects. What?
[46:42.000 --> 46:51.000]  I say, please, Kimmel, find out the facts and help people. Find out how fluoride's causing heart defects and brain defects in utero. That was CNN last week.
[46:51.000 --> 47:02.000]  I told you 20 years ago, had top scientists on. Hey, Kimmel, I told you, I said, look at fluoride. Are you drinking fluoridated water? Maybe your next child won't have these problems. I'm trying to help you.
[47:02.000 --> 47:20.000]  But see, you don't want my help. There it is, fluoride exposure in utero, linked to lower IQs and kids, study finds. They'll just edit this together and put it on Comedy Central to make it look like I just attacked Jimmy Kimmel again because they're bad people who are counting on you
[47:20.000 --> 47:28.000]  not paying attention, not being involved, not being informed. They don't want you to know the score.
[47:28.000 --> 47:40.000]  Now, before we go any further, we need to be funded. I'm going to come back with more on the tax cuts and more on the repeal of Obamacare.
[47:40.000 --> 47:51.000]  And it's all a train wreck. It's all a mess. Once you get government involved in healthcare, once you get regulations, once you get government putting money in and they can force people to pay whatever they want, what's going to happen?
[47:51.000 --> 47:58.000]  If corporations can force you to buy a product that you've got to have, what's going to happen to the price? I'm going to say that again.
[47:58.000 --> 48:10.000]  If corporations can force you to buy a product and there's no competition and you've got to have it, what's the price going to be on it? Astronomical. Sky high.
[48:10.000 --> 48:23.000]  And when the public's ignorant about it, you're going to pay the most for prescription drugs in the world and then wonder why you do it because government let them do it by not letting the competition in.
[48:23.000 --> 48:37.000]  They'll cover up new deadly vaccines, but hold off drugs 10 years that they know undercut the price and effectiveness of all the others. It's a fact.
[48:37.000 --> 48:42.000]  But they want to keep chomping you until the end of time.
[48:42.000 --> 48:53.000]  Now, one big thing for pregnant women and everybody else is real minerals that aren't synthetic but that are bioavailable and we've got it. The very best fruit punch mix out there.

[54:26.000 --> 54:47.000]  Well, for anybody saying that Trump hasn't delivered, he thinks he has the votes in the House and Senate for this tax reform framework that he's put out and it does stuff like doubling the tax right off for married families with children.
[54:47.000 --> 54:59.000]  It does things like cut taxes on the middle class and poor working folks. It cuts the corporate tax massively down to 20% making it globally competitive.
[54:59.000 --> 55:10.000]  It gets rid of the estate tax. It gets rid of a bunch of loopholes that rich people and big corporations use to keep their money offshore and to avoid taxes.
[55:10.000 --> 55:25.000]  I mean, if you want a classic Americana JFK style plan, this is very similar to what JFK had in place, minus the estate tax.
[55:25.000 --> 55:33.000]  Imagine somebody dies with $20 million and you give $17 million of it to the government. Is that fair?
[55:33.000 --> 55:41.000]  And it forces people that own businesses or factories to break them up.
[55:41.000 --> 55:50.000]  And that goes back to laws they had in some areas after Civil War where they wanted to break up plantations.
[55:50.000 --> 56:00.000]  So they said, you can't give all the property to one son. You have to break it up and sell it off.
[56:00.000 --> 56:08.000]  And so it's a very, very communistic idea. I mean, I don't like the fact you got the Walmart heirs, each one of them worth like $60 billion.
[56:08.000 --> 56:13.000]  And you add them all together. It's like $400 billion. It's just ridiculous.
[56:13.000 --> 56:20.000]  And it is asinine and they use deals with China to bring in slave goods, but they've got big giant American flags hanging up everywhere.
[56:20.000 --> 56:25.000]  So it's supposedly okay saying made America.
[56:25.000 --> 56:32.000]  That's right. Six Walmart heirs hold more than 42% of Americans combined.
[56:32.000 --> 56:37.000]  That's obscene because Walmart is a parasitic organization.
[56:37.000 --> 56:42.000]  But if you look at Walmart compared to Amazon, they're nothing.
[56:42.000 --> 56:48.000]  Amazon's anti-American, anti-gun, pro-globalist, at least Walmart's kind of neutral.
[56:48.000 --> 56:54.000]  It totally exploits China worse than Walmart even does and is even causing Walmart to fall apart.
[56:54.000 --> 56:58.000]  Because at least Walmart does hire a few people regionally.
[56:58.000 --> 57:05.000]  It's killed all the small towns, but we're going from one cancer to something even worse.
[57:05.000 --> 57:11.000]  And that's why it's so essential that we don't just go to the big Facebook's and the Twitter's and the Googles.
[57:11.000 --> 57:19.000]  They're like the Walmart's and the Amazon's of news that we go to themfullwars.com's and thenewswars.com's and thedrudgereport.com's.
[57:19.000 --> 57:25.000]  But also you need to start your own websites, your own platforms. Just report on stuff about what's happening locally.
[57:25.000 --> 57:30.000]  Give your opinion. Shoot a video. People are interested in you.
[57:30.000 --> 57:34.000]  McBrain was showing me this yesterday. I meant to actually give it to the crew over here, but I forgot.
[57:34.000 --> 57:36.000]  He's over on the slash TV side.
[57:36.000 --> 57:42.000]  And he was showing me this black Facebook channel, black guys that are just mainline.
[57:42.000 --> 57:45.000]  They're not liberal or conservative, but they just common sense.
[57:45.000 --> 57:49.000]  I was like watching it. I forget the channel name for like 30 minutes last night.
[57:49.000 --> 57:52.000]  I couldn't turn it off. It was just really common sense.
[57:52.000 --> 57:54.000]  And their average video has like 2 million views.
[57:54.000 --> 58:01.000]  They have one video with 38 million views this week talking about the NFL.
[58:01.000 --> 58:09.000]  And you could put those guys on CNN and CNN would go from having a million viewers to 10 million within one week.
[58:09.000 --> 58:14.000]  But CNN won't do it because they don't control those guys.
[58:14.000 --> 58:18.000]  It's not that I'm even that good, folks. I've just been around longer than other folks.
[58:18.000 --> 58:23.000]  That's why it's so exciting just to see all these new people popping up that are just unbelievable.
[58:23.000 --> 58:27.000]  The problem is as soon as they get really big, Facebook starts shutting them down.
[58:27.000 --> 58:30.000]  But it's like whack-a-mole. You could shut down everybody.
[58:30.000 --> 58:34.000]  More folks are going to pop up. People are sick of establishment.
[58:34.000 --> 58:38.000]  They want straight up common sense, but it's conservative and it's liberal.
[58:38.000 --> 58:43.000]  It's just common sense Americana working together, being decent.
[58:43.000 --> 58:45.000]  We'll be right back with second hour.
[58:45.000 --> 59:14.000]  I'm going to find out the name of that channel.
[59:45.000 --> 59:58.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:30.000]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:46.000]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide. It's Alex Jones.
[01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:51.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are broadcasting worldwide. We are now into hour number two.
[01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:55.000]  The man who was put in prison, the man who lost basically everything.
[01:00:55.000 --> 01:01:01.000]  He's taken a photograph on board a nuclear submarine that didn't give up any secrets who Trump said was wronged.
[01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:04.000]  Look at Hillary running around doing a million times that.
[01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:06.000]  He's going to be joining us. He's asking for a pardon.
[01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:11.000]  Also, you're seeing the rise of not conservative, not libertarians,
[01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:16.000]  which is common sense black folks who aren't going along with democratic party plantation.
[01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:20.000]  I saw this channel yesterday. Couldn't quit watching out of these guys.
[01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:25.000]  Their average video has a couple of million views. They got a bunch of 15 million, 20 million views.
[01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:28.000]  Brandon Tatum won with 38 million events, like 50 million today.
[01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:32.000]  And it's just awesome. And the media can't compete with this.
[01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:35.000]  But I want to finish up with Trump.
[01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:37.000]  Yeah, that particular video has 13 million.
[01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:41.000]  When I saw the green head ups, 38 million or that might have been reached.
[01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:47.000]  But the point is, this is why the globalists want to shut down the free web because they're putting out propaganda.
[01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:50.000]  They didn't just, oh, shut down Alex Jones or shut down Matt Drudge.
[01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:53.000]  You can't shut everybody down. People see what's going on.
[01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:55.000]  People are sick of it.
[01:01:55.000 --> 01:02:00.000]  Here's more of Trump on the historic tax cut proposals where he is delivering on the proposal.
[01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:03.000]  I agree with the tax plan. It's it's excellent tax plan.
[01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:10.000]  Give you free spending. It will get us out of this recession and get us into paying down that national debt.
[01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:12.000]  Here it is.
[01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:17.000]  America is back on the right track and I see so many red hats. Make America great again.
[01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:20.000]  That's what we're doing. Make America great again.
[01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:30.000]  But our country and our economy cannot take off like they should.
[01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:38.000]  Unless we dramatically reform America's outdated, complex and extremely burdensome tax code.
[01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:43.000]  It's a relic. Got to change it. We have to compete.
[01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:45.000]  Compete with other countries.
[01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:52.000]  The current tax system is a colossal barrier standing in the way of America's economic comeback
[01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:55.000]  because it can be far greater than it's ever been.
[01:02:55.000 --> 01:03:04.000]  But we're going to remove that barrier to create the tax system that our people finally, finally, finally and want and deserve.
[01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:13.000]  For several months, my administration has been working closely with Congress to develop a framework for tax reform.
[01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:21.000]  Over the next few months, the House and Senate will build on this framework and produce legislation that will deliver more jobs,
[01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:30.000]  higher pay and lower taxes for middle class families, for the working man and woman and for businesses of all sizes.
[01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:49.000]  I look forward to working with Congress to deliver these historic tax cuts and reforms to the American people.
[01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:56.000]  These tax cuts are significant. There's never been tax cuts like what we're talking about.
[01:03:56.000 --> 01:04:01.000]  Our framework is based on four key ideas.
[01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:12.000]  First, we will cut taxes for the everyday hardworking Americans, the people that work so long, so hard, and they've been forgotten.
[01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:16.000]  But they're not forgotten anymore. I think we proved that on November 8th.
[01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:38.000]  Under this framework, the first $12,000 of income earned by a single individual will be tax-free.
[01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:49.000]  And a married couple won't pay a dime in taxes on their first $24,000 of income, so a married couple up to $24,000.
[01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:56.000]  That's doubling the tax cut on that. That's doubling that exemption. And it just goes on from there. We'll be right back.
[01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:58.000]  It gets better and better.
[01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:09.000]  What exactly is political correctness and why is it being pushed on the American public? Well, political correctness is simply a form of psychological manipulation the government uses to control public opinion.
[01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:18.000]  By controlling your opinions, the establishment gets you to not only agree with their agenda, but to also ensure that your government-created viewpoint also influences others in ripple effect.
[01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:24.000]  This is how the power elite and the government stay in power. They use psychological manipulation to turn the public into obedient sheeple,
[01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:31.000]  and over time, we lose our ability to distinguish reality from deception. But how does political correctness and other deliberate deceptions work?
[01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:41.000]  Well, first, the establishment saturates mass media with their agenda they're trying to push until it invades every aspect of popular culture and is accepted as truth, such as global warming, for example.
[01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:50.000]  Then the establishment suppresses any counterarguments through their agenda by calling critics kooky, nutjobs, racists, or, in the case of man-made climate change, climate deniers.
[01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:58.000]  You can learn more about this tyranny over the minds of men at Infowars.com, PrismPlanet.tv, and our YouTube channel, Resistance News. This is Kit Daniels reporting.
[01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:28.000]  Our amazing mouthwash features natural oils and ancient ingredients used since aboriginal and biblical times.
[01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:38.000]  Instead of containing fluoride, our super blue line is floated with the good halogen iodine and an array of other beneficial compounds that have been hand-selected for their oral health benefits.
[01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:45.000]  Super blue, fluoride-free mouthwash and toothpaste are the first and only to contain all of these natural ingredients.
[01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:52.000]  Xylitol, nano-silver, and iodine. Notice the difference with our super blue, fluoride-free products.
[01:06:52.000 --> 01:07:17.000]  Notice your breath and invigorate your oral health routine at InfowarsStore.com. That's InfowarsStore.com.

[01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:42.000]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee, and it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:52.000]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed. Available in original or with our immune support infusion blend. You will be supporting a free press.

[01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:21.000]  Waging War on Corruption. It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the Infowar.
[01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:32.000]  Coming up, they've already aired a couple episodes of this Comedy Central disinformation program called The Opposition.
[01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:42.000]  So I thought we'd play a few clips of it and just analyze them because it shows who their enemy is. Nationalists, people that are free market, people that are pro-America,
[01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:53.000]  people that support open, good societies that have always worked and produced incredible wealth and incredible freedom.
[01:08:53.000 --> 01:09:06.000]  And there they are promoting collectivism, Obamacare, all these lies. And to do that, they twist and deceive and manipulate to try to misrepresent what we stand for.
[01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:14.000]  Well, that's coming up at the bottom of the hour. Trump's tax reform plan is a great plan. The problem is the Republicans are going to try to butcher it.
[01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:24.000]  Along with the Democrats, we're going to be going over that more, but simply amazing. Couples making $24,000 a year, no taxes.
[01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:29.000]  There's still been taxes out of your paycheck on that, folks. They take a percentage out. It's wrong.
[01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:37.000]  And then if you have children, they've doubled the deduction there instead of having basically taxing you for having kids as Europe and others are going for.
[01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:44.000]  Big tax cuts to the middle class, big tax cuts on working poor, but gets rid of the tax loopholes for rich people.
[01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:51.000]  And when they say rich, they mean millionaires. They mean folks that are offshore. It gets rid of so many loopholes.
[01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:56.000]  I've gone over this plan. It is exactly what I would do.
[01:09:56.000 --> 01:10:03.000]  So this is the old Americana plan that gave us six, seven, eight, nine, 10% yearly growth rates.
[01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:13.000]  Trump's already gotten us to 3%. Something they said could never be done because in eight years of Obama, it never happened.
[01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:18.000]  He's already cut a lot of the regulations, got the coal back in place. That's our main power source.
[01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:26.000]  Very inexpensive. If we can't have that coal, China has the coal. They have electricity three times cheaper than us because of that.
[01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:35.000]  It's amazing. GDP growth, by the way, was raised from 3.0 to 3.1. That is amazing.
[01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:41.000]  What are they doing? They're trying to crash the stock market. They're trying to not let him have the tax cuts, trying to keep Obamacare in place.
[01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:46.000]  Because if you keep those in place, it's a wet blanket, and then we'll have a cold start on this economy.
[01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:52.000]  They know what they're doing. The globalists are out to get this country. They admit they are. That's the admitted plan.
[01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:58.000]  The Democrats admit it. The WikiLeaks admit it. So that's all coming up.
[01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:04.000]  Also, I didn't get to this yesterday, but I just saw it again this morning. I've got to play it coming up later.
[01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:15.000]  LeBron James in a stuttering, mindless, barely-can-talk rant against uneducated Trump supporters.
[01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:22.000]  I mean, it's just rich. So we're going to be playing that unintentional comedy coming up.
[01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:32.000]  I mean, you've got this dumbass up there mad. Again, it's how you're doing the protests, and it's all supposed to be racially-based.
[01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:37.000]  And then when Trump says it's wrong, they say he's a racist because it's mainly black guys taking a knee.
[01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:42.000]  The point is, it's the national anthem. People want to watch a football game. They didn't do anything to you.
[01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:45.000]  Go protest at the Capitol or go protest at the White House or go...
[01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:50.000]  But don't go to a... I mean, I'm not going to go to your Little League football game and protest there.
[01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:57.000]  I'm not going to go to your school choir and do it. But what did the head of the spurs say?
[01:11:57.000 --> 01:12:00.000]  White people are bad. We've got to make them be uncomfortable.
[01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:05.000]  What a racist statement by that weird cracker coach.
[01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:09.000]  But again, these are self-loving white people that just want a virtue signal.
[01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:14.000]  They were racially-based before. I was talking to one of the founders of the Black Panther Party.
[01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:20.000]  And I said, why is it weirdo white people like this Baylor professor that, you know, says, kill all the white people?
[01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:25.000]  She's white. Why is it white people continually saying kill all the white people?
[01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:29.000]  Then we say, hey, what's all this white genocide stuff? And they go, oh, that's a white supremacist term.
[01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:35.000]  No, that's it. All the major universities, I can show you 100 professors or more saying we need to genocide the white race.
[01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:42.000]  Or feminist magazines saying abort your white baby.
[01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:47.000]  I'm asking why this is being promoted. They're the ones saying it. It's like Comedy Central goes.
[01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:50.000]  Jones says that the Clintons do voodoo.
[01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:55.000]  No, Bill Clinton wrote it in two books that he likes to do voodoo. And the Washington Post reported it.
[01:12:55.000 --> 01:13:01.000]  Yes, I agree. That's crazy. That's weird. That's nuts.
[01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:05.000]  That's like people believe Harry Potter is real.
[01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:08.000]  Or the liberals saying God sent the hurricanes to get Trump.
[01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:13.000]  When preachers say God sent a hurricane because Florida's got gay people in it, I think that's crazy.
[01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:18.000]  But it's just as crazy when some leftist, I mean, it wasn't just one little lone preacher saying that.
[01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:26.000]  It was all the left and all these big so-called movie stars like Jennifer Lawrence saying mother nature is attacking because of Trump.
[01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:34.000]  Oh, is that why Puerto Rico that votes Democrat doesn't have any power?
[01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:37.000]  Oh, thank God Houston got flooded. They're a bunch of white supremacists.
[01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:44.000]  Charlie Hebdo magazine showing people hiling Hitler out of the water when Houston's only 30% white.
[01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:48.000]  You people are idiots. Excuse me. I'm getting really upset right now.
[01:13:48.000 --> 01:14:02.000]  Now, Chris Saucer is a U.S. naval machinist, mate, who served on the nuclear power to attack submarine USS Alexandria in 2009 when it was in port at Rotten, Connecticut.
[01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:09.000]  All there he took six cell phone pictures for his family to illustrate the work he did, an area that was restricted from photo taking.
[01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:13.000]  Years later, the cell phone was found and the photos discovered.
[01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:18.000]  So again, he had no intent. It wasn't sold. It wasn't used. I agree. Probably shouldn't have done it.
[01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:23.000]  Aside from this somewhat common infraction, often punished by being demoted to a lower pay grade and rank.
[01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:32.000]  Chris had served honorably with high praise from his superiors as an important and skilled member of the U.S. nuclear Navy's elite submarine corps.
[01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:45.000]  In 2016 presidential campaign, the civilian court decision, Senate's Chris, nearly a year in prison, he became a national topic when Donald Trump contrasted Saucer's harsh punishment to the non-punishment that Hillary Clinton enjoyed
[01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:53.000]  after having even beyond top secret, just ultra-secret communications and dozens of classified ones on her private and highly hackable server.
[01:14:53.000 --> 01:15:01.000]  That was the drop-off box, not a trash can, not under a bush, not under, you know, the park bench, as a lot of folks have been caught doing.
[01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:07.000]  It's just, oh, a server, I don't know. You put the data on, the foreign government gives a donation to your charity.
[01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:14.000]  And they now even have the pay-per-play communications when they're like, can we get that info? Yeah, give me a million, you'll get it in the usual spot.
[01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:20.000]  Or, oh, you give me five million, you'll get your meeting with me next week. I mean, it's all open and shut.
[01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:26.000]  But that's not bad. You take some pictures of this, you standing there with some submarine equipment behind you.
[01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:34.000]  But meanwhile, you actually give the Chinese and the Russians all our technology, give them missiles, give them the nukes, like the Clintons did, you know, in North Korea, that's all okay.
[01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:44.000]  And then throw this guy into a meat grinder. It's like convicting Petraeus, who I don't particularly like, you know, having classified stuff at his home.
[01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:51.000]  No evidence he was sharing it. And then Hillary doesn't get in trouble. I mean, again, it's the same thing. It's the selective enforcement.
[01:15:51.000 --> 01:16:02.000]  So Chris Saucier joining us. Help Chris Saucier.com. Let's go ahead and play one of the many times Trump talked about Chris. Here's that clip.
[01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:12.000]  So we're going to get a special prosecutor and we're going to look into it because, you know what, people have been, their lives have been destroyed for doing one-fifth of what you've done.
[01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:17.000]  And it's a disgrace. And honestly, you ought to be ashamed of yourself.
[01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:25.000]  And it's Chris Saucier. I can't pronounce anything. I was asking earlier how to pronounce it. I'm from Texas. I can barely pronounce Texas.
[01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:34.000]  Call it Tejas, I guess. So Chris Saucier. Good to have you on here with us with all this new stuff coming out, all the things that are happening.
[01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:44.000]  What's your view on this? I know you're calling for the president to look into pardoning you. I agree. It'd be a great stunt, not just helping you to expose what a fraud Hillary is.
[01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:51.000]  Yes, absolutely. You know, I think what's most upsetting about this whole thing is that my family and I are all patriots and proud Americans.
[01:16:51.000 --> 01:17:04.000]  And I served 11 years honorably in the military and they just railroaded us. And then somebody like Hillary Clinton and John Podesta and Huma Abedin, who don't care about this country, and frankly, they just want to make money off of us, are allowed to get a pass.
[01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:10.000]  You know, and that's what's really disturbing about this whole thing. You know, I did a year in prison and I accepted responsibility.
[01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:16.000]  I took whatever punishment they were going to hand out to me and I waited until after I'd served my time to speak out about it.
[01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:25.000]  But, you know, I sat in prison and I watched her scoff like in that video that you just showed about how, oh, well, you know, she knew nothing was going to happen to her.
[01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:32.000]  It's upsetting because, you know, here I am in prison and she's running for president of the United States and she had highly classified information.
[01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:44.000]  The pictures I took were confidential, which is the lowest tier of classification. And here she has top secret STI special compartmentalized information on a bathroom server so she can avoid Freedom of Information Act requests.
[01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:55.000]  And not only not her, but Cheryl Mills, Huma Abedin, John Podesta, they just skate on this and honest Americans like my family and I are just destroyed.
[01:17:55.000 --> 01:18:02.000]  They destroyed us financially. They destroyed my Navy career. They gave me a, now I'm a felon and I have another than honorable discharge from the military.
[01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:13.000]  So, you know, it's just, it's insane. My house went into foreclosure while I was in prison and our vehicles were repossessed and we spent over $200,000 just to get to the point where I could plead guilty and accept responsibility.
[01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:16.000]  I didn't even go to trial. I was willing to take responsibility.
[01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:26.000]  But just to get to that point, because they took me to a civilian court and not a military court where I would have been provided a free JAG lawyer to represent me, which is how it should have went.
[01:18:26.000 --> 01:18:27.000]  If they really wanted to.
[01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:33.000]  And that's what even the news admits that if you got in the military trial, you would have probably been given a bunch of extra duty and, you know, knocked down a rank or something.
[01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:38.000]  Why do you think you got thrown in prison for a year? Why do you think they threw the book at you?
[01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:48.000]  Well, because the Obama administration wanted to have a smoke screen and what perfect example than me. You know, they say, oh, look, we're hard on people mishandling classified information.
[01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:54.000]  As long as you're not running for president or, you know, one of our buddies, they just go after you. And that's what they did to me.
[01:18:54.000 --> 01:19:02.000]  You know, it wasn't anything other than that. You know, the investigation began in 2012 and then almost nothing happened until the election was coming up.
[01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:05.000]  And the Obama administration saw a prime example.
[01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:10.000]  Well, by the way, I've watched documentaries about nuclear subs that are even active duty. The gauges are all off here.
[01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:16.000]  I'm not defending what you did, but I've seen history channel shows showing the same type of submarines where they have cameras down in there.
[01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:22.000]  So is what you showed really classified or is it just no cameras period in case you were a spy?
[01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:24.000]  Yeah, they just say you can't take pictures in the interim.
[01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:30.000]  Unfortunately, I took pictures in the interim because that's where I worked and I was proud of it and I wanted to be able to have some memories of it.
[01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:36.000]  And, you know, other people were taking pictures there too. Not that it justifies what I did. I take responsibility for what I did.
[01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:43.000]  But, you know, our command would say, hey, don't take pictures here, but then you'd see high ranking members of the command taking pictures in those areas.
[01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:53.000]  You know, and it wasn't nefarious purposes. You're absolutely right. If you Google Los Angeles class submarines that were designed in the 60s, you'll find all kinds of pictures of the inside of the engine.
[01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:58.000]  To the point is Obama wanted to look tough and throw a bunch of people in prison as a smokescreen.
[01:19:58.000 --> 01:20:01.000]  Do you trust our economy? How about our banking system?
[01:20:01.000 --> 01:20:08.000]  Our president has stated we are sitting on a bubble right now and that when the Fed raises interest rates, bad things are going to happen.
[01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:19.000]  Well, the Fed is raising rates here and now. There has never been a better time to turn your IRA or 401K into physical gold or silver with GSI exchange.

[01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:41.000]  And of course, President Trump famously used him as an example during the debates with Hillary, who had her illegal drop box server to transfer clandestine information to foreign powers and corporations.
[01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:45.000]  We now know that. They allowed the DNC to be penetrated by Pakistan.
[01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:50.000]  I mean, this was a full-out operation to sell out the country. Why not? They're globalists.
[01:24:50.000 --> 01:24:56.000]  What are you asking the president to do specifically to help Chris Saucier online?
[01:24:56.000 --> 01:25:01.000]  Well, we're asking people to go on to the website www.helpchristaucier.com.
[01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:06.000]  And, you know, there's a petition on there to help reach out to President Trump.
[01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:12.000]  And, you know, it definitely would help a lot if he restored my good name by giving me a pardon.
[01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:18.000]  You know, I served the full year in prison, so I did my time. I paid my debt to society.
[01:25:18.000 --> 01:25:25.000]  And I just like to be able to move on with my life. My family and I are trying to get ourselves, you know, dig ourselves out of the financial hole this put us in.
[01:25:25.000 --> 01:25:35.000]  And, you know, it's upsetting that, you know, after serving 11 years honorably in the military that, you know, they took all my veterans' benefits away.
[01:25:35.000 --> 01:25:39.000]  They took away, you know, everything my family had worked for.
[01:25:39.000 --> 01:25:47.000]  And people like Hillary Clinton are allowed to just continue making millions of dollars off of this country's, you know, at this time.
[01:25:47.000 --> 01:25:55.000]  My argument's going to be, if they let you get away with it when clearly everybody's doing it and it's a classified area, but it's not really should be classified.
[01:25:55.000 --> 01:26:00.000]  But, I mean, obviously they don't want to have spies able to, who are in the military, to take photos of things.
[01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:04.000]  So they have to punish everybody. But if Hillary is above the law, then you should get a reprieve.
[01:26:04.000 --> 01:26:12.000]  And it's a way to expose what a fraud she is. But at the same time, if Trump does it, then the next time somebody's going to want a pardon.
[01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:19.000]  Well, I would argue the fact that I still spent a year in prison. I served my time. I didn't speak out about this until I'd served my year in prison.
[01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:22.000]  So I paid a heavy price. You know, my family-
[01:26:22.000 --> 01:26:26.000]  No, no, listen, I totally agree with you. I was just giving devils abdicate argument.
[01:26:26.000 --> 01:26:33.000]  Oh, yeah. I agree with you. And I've heard that before. And that's part of the reason why I waited to speak out about it until I'd served my time.
[01:26:33.000 --> 01:26:39.000]  I was, unlike, you know, Hillary Clinton and them who said, oh, I take responsibility, but then don't really take responsibility.
[01:26:39.000 --> 01:26:44.000]  I went into court and I took responsibility. I pled guilty. I was willing to take the punishment.
[01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:49.000]  And I took it and I didn't cry like Anthony Weiner, you know, when he got sentenced for what he did.
[01:26:49.000 --> 01:26:53.000]  I sat there. I took my punishment. I went to prison like a man and I came out of it.
[01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:59.000]  And now I want to speak out because I honestly hoped while I was in prison that because they did what they did to me,
[01:26:59.000 --> 01:27:01.000]  they'd have no choice but to prosecute Hillary Clinton.
[01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:05.000]  I thought, well, you know, if nothing else, my case will serve as an example.
[01:27:05.000 --> 01:27:12.000]  So you wouldn't be asking for a pardon now if it wasn't for the fact that Hillary and others like her get away with murder
[01:27:12.000 --> 01:27:19.000]  and then you do some little crooked toenail thing and throw them the wolves as a stunt to cover up for them doing the actual crimes.
[01:27:19.000 --> 01:27:22.000]  Exactly. That's what's most upsetting about this whole thing.
[01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:26.000]  Two people on the same ship as me took pictures in the same exact area at the same time that I did.
[01:27:26.000 --> 01:27:31.000]  And they were only given a $200 fine and allowed to continue on with their Navy career.
[01:27:31.000 --> 01:27:37.000]  Make no mistake, my case against me was no different than it would have been against these two guys,
[01:27:37.000 --> 01:27:42.000]  but it just happened that my case got the spotlight drawn on it by the Obama administration
[01:27:42.000 --> 01:27:49.000]  and they saw a prime opportunity to make an example using the fake media and basically painting me as this horrible person that I'm not.
[01:27:49.000 --> 01:27:52.000]  And I think that's what should be upsetting to people.
[01:27:52.000 --> 01:27:56.000]  I'm not trying to say, you know, I'm never going to get the year that I lost my two-year-old daughter back.
[01:27:56.000 --> 01:27:59.000]  I'm never going to get all the money and the stuff that they've taken back from me.
[01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:02.000]  What I want is a fair justice system in this country.
[01:28:02.000 --> 01:28:05.000]  And I think we, as American people, have been robbed of that.
[01:28:05.000 --> 01:28:12.000]  And I think people are starting to see, because of people like you that are willing to speak the truth and aren't afraid to blast the people that are lying to us,
[01:28:12.000 --> 01:28:16.000]  they're starting to see through the world that's been pulled over eyes that, you know,
[01:28:16.000 --> 01:28:23.000]  honest, hardworking Americans really get the shaft in this country while the elitists, they're allowed to, you know, like you said,
[01:28:23.000 --> 01:28:25.000]  basically kill people and get away with it.
[01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:27.000]  And it's upsetting, you know?
[01:28:27.000 --> 01:28:31.000]  I don't think that it's ever going to make, you know, that year's not going to go away that I lost.
[01:28:31.000 --> 01:28:35.000]  What they did to my family for four years isn't going to go away.
[01:28:35.000 --> 01:28:40.000]  But President Trump, by giving me a pardon, would say, you know what, what happened to you was wrong.
[01:28:40.000 --> 01:28:46.000]  He said it during, on the campaign trail, he said it while being interviewed by Sean Hannity after the election was over and he'd won the presidency.
[01:28:46.000 --> 01:28:50.000]  And he said what happened to my family and I was wrong.
[01:28:50.000 --> 01:28:54.000]  And I think he would be sending a very clear signal that he's not okay with that.
[01:28:54.000 --> 01:28:56.000]  By giving me a pardon, he would share it.
[01:28:56.000 --> 01:28:58.000]  Again, it wasn't the military that did it to you.
[01:28:58.000 --> 01:28:59.000]  It was a witch hunt.
[01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:02.000]  In fact, that's an interesting part of the story that people can read about on your website.
[01:29:02.000 --> 01:29:06.000]  Somebody found this on the phone later and then it was decided to go after you?
[01:29:06.000 --> 01:29:07.000]  Yeah.
[01:29:07.000 --> 01:29:14.000]  A dump worker at the local dump that happened to have gone to high school with my ex-wife found this phone,
[01:29:14.000 --> 01:29:17.000]  supposedly in the middle of a 40 cubic yard dumpster.
[01:29:17.000 --> 01:29:19.000]  It was an old flip phone in 2000.
[01:29:19.000 --> 01:29:20.000]  Wow.
[01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:23.000]  I mean, so you've got somebody snooping in your phone at the dump.
[01:29:23.000 --> 01:29:27.000]  And it's photos you never use on an old cell phone, cruddy quality, and you go to prison.
[01:29:27.000 --> 01:29:33.000]  That's who they pick as examples in this country to stop spies instead of the globalist spies selling us out.
[01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:36.000]  Chris Saucier will talk to you soon and get an update.
[01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:39.000]  I'm sure this will end up getting to the president's desk.
[01:29:39.000 --> 01:29:40.000]  Help chrissaucier.com.
[01:29:40.000 --> 01:29:41.000]  God bless you, sir.
[01:29:41.000 --> 01:29:44.000]  This is a true injustice and we're going to get on top of this.
[01:29:44.000 --> 01:29:45.000]  God bless you.
[01:29:45.000 --> 01:29:46.000]  Thank you.
[01:29:47.000 --> 01:29:48.000]  We're on the march.
[01:29:48.000 --> 01:29:51.000]  The empire's on the run.
[01:29:51.000 --> 01:29:54.000]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:21.000 --> 01:30:25.000]  We're treated as indentured servants who only exist to serve the needs of the establishment.
[01:30:25.000 --> 01:30:32.000]  Political office no longer represents the voice of the people, but rather the initiation process politicians go through to gain acceptance into the aristocracy.
[01:30:32.000 --> 01:30:40.000]  Simply put, we the people are responsible for civilization and culture, yet we're suppressed by a tiny elite who have organized into criminal gangs that operate governments around the world.
[01:30:40.000 --> 01:30:48.000]  We falsely believe that everything is simply black and white, one extreme against the other, conservative versus liberal, but things will change once more of us realize this truth.
[01:30:48.000 --> 01:30:55.000]  As Thomas Jefferson also said, enlighten the people generally and tyranny and oppressions of the body and mind will vanish like evil spirits at the dawn of day.
[01:30:55.000 --> 01:31:19.000]  This is Kit Daniels within FullWars.com.
[01:31:26.000 --> 01:31:29.000]  The larger the particle, the safer it is for your body.
[01:31:29.000 --> 01:31:33.000]  The organic oils help hydrate the skin, leaving it nice and smooth.
[01:31:33.000 --> 01:31:38.000]  The truly natural fragrance-free sunscreen for the most sensitive skin.
[01:31:38.000 --> 01:31:44.000]  EmRick's Essentials wants you to enjoy the sun and strives to bring you organic products to enhance your life.

[01:31:58.000 --> 01:32:03.000]  As most of you already know, I am a voracious consumer of news and information.
[01:32:03.000 --> 01:32:16.000]  And in the last four or five years doing more and more research, I came across the fact that the elite establishment is fully aware of the fact that our ancient ancestors, in many cases, had much better nutrition than we do today.
[01:32:16.000 --> 01:32:23.000]  And our ancient ancestors sought out the bones of the animals that they were hunting, killing, and then processing.
[01:32:23.000 --> 01:32:37.000]  And so I set out to develop Caveman, but to not just have concentrated bone broth from chicken, but seven other superfood ingredients known for cleansing and supercharging the body at the same time.
[01:32:37.000 --> 01:32:47.000]  Infowars isn't just fighting the globalist, we're getting results and we're expanding in the face of the complete media assault and winning because of your support.
[01:32:47.000 --> 01:32:58.000]  Caveman is back in stock, people absolutely love it, so please secure your Caveman today at infowarslife.com or by calling toll-free, CRIPLE-A-253-3139.
[01:32:58.000 --> 01:33:15.000]  In the councils of government, we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted invoices, whether sought or unsought, by the military industrial commentaries.
[01:33:15.000 --> 01:33:21.000]  In Dallas, Texas, three shots were fired at President Kennedy's motorcade in downtown Dallas.
[01:33:21.000 --> 01:33:28.000]  The first report to say that President Kennedy has been seriously wounded by the shooting.
[01:33:28.000 --> 01:33:32.000]  It is a big idea, a new order.
[01:33:35.000 --> 01:33:40.000]  It was almost as if it were planned in force, it just banked.
[01:33:40.000 --> 01:33:49.000]  Either you were with us, or you were with the terrorists.
[01:33:58.000 --> 01:34:08.000]  I also believe that a lot of God always would agree that the AK-47s were walking hands of soldiers, not the hands of criminals.
[01:34:08.000 --> 01:34:18.000]  For many of the police and guard troops, it is an uncomfortable job to do this in an American city.
[01:34:18.000 --> 01:34:22.000]  Global governance at last. Is it one world? The central bank was in charge.
[01:34:22.000 --> 01:34:26.000]  Aren't we all just living and dying for what the central banks do?
[01:34:26.000 --> 01:34:32.000]  1776 will commence again. If you're proud to take our firearms, do you understand?
[01:34:32.000 --> 01:34:39.000]  From the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[01:35:02.000 --> 01:35:09.000]  You are not the president. No one who leads so many could possibly kneel so quickly.
[01:35:09.000 --> 01:35:20.000]  Rallying Patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty. It's Alex Jones.
[01:35:26.000 --> 01:35:36.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, you think about the psychology, you think about the iconography, the imagery of National Baseball League,
[01:35:36.000 --> 01:35:46.000]  National Basketball League, National Football League players getting on their knees to fight injustice
[01:35:46.000 --> 01:35:58.000]  and being directed to do so by Kaepernick, whose wife is an admitted communist and a BLM pusher.
[01:35:58.000 --> 01:36:07.000]  And you're worth $200 million from San Francisco and you start sitting on your fat butt, not just kneeling.
[01:36:07.000 --> 01:36:14.000]  And then you come up with a plan, they admit, to direct the rest of the NFL players to kneel
[01:36:14.000 --> 01:36:22.000]  and then you lose your job because you suck because you're a terrible football player
[01:36:22.000 --> 01:36:29.000]  and then you sue them because they won't hire you. Oh, you're going to sue them because they're not inclusive of black people?
[01:36:29.000 --> 01:36:41.000]  What, the NFL is 70% black? But on the front line, 91% in 2017 of first string players are African-American.
[01:36:41.000 --> 01:36:47.000]  What are you going to sue because you're black and they didn't let you in the NFL?
[01:36:47.000 --> 01:36:54.000]  That's right. Kaepernick's wife has now compared the NFL to lots of other unsavory things.
[01:36:54.000 --> 01:37:06.000]  We've seen this quite a bit. People worth hundreds of millions of dollars wanting to virtue signal how evil the blue collar white people are
[01:37:06.000 --> 01:37:13.000]  wearing jerseys of black football players and praising them and looking up to them.
[01:37:13.000 --> 01:37:24.000]  This is the incredible, horrible racism that we see.
[01:37:24.000 --> 01:37:31.000]  And this is Kaepernick's girlfriend fantasizing about black people killing their white friends.
[01:37:31.000 --> 01:37:35.000]  I mean, you look at the look on her face, she looks like a complete loon.
[01:37:35.000 --> 01:37:41.000]  It's like you see white races, they look all crazy because they spend their whole lives hating some other group.
[01:37:41.000 --> 01:37:48.000]  Put that back on screen that you just found where she's bad-mouthing the NFL.
[01:37:48.000 --> 01:38:02.000]  Yes, yes, she's comparing him to a house slave because he's, it's from the movie Django where the house slave is hugging the master Leonardo DiCaprio
[01:38:02.000 --> 01:38:07.000]  and then it shows one of the other football players hugging a white guy and this is enslavement.
[01:38:07.000 --> 01:38:14.000]  You know, you're making hundreds of millions of dollars and white fans are coming and a white owner is making some money.
[01:38:14.000 --> 01:38:17.000]  In some cases, these owners aren't even making as much as their star players.
[01:38:17.000 --> 01:38:24.000]  This is sick and people are tired of it.
[01:38:24.000 --> 01:38:30.000]  Now, I wanted to go to a few clips on this.
[01:38:30.000 --> 01:38:51.000]  First off, we have this very important piece of news here dealing with all of this where President Trump has come out and said that
[01:38:51.000 --> 01:38:58.000]  the American people just can't handle this anymore and that if the NFL doesn't reverse the stance, they're destroying themselves.
[01:38:58.000 --> 01:39:08.000]  That's just a truth and Trump's not going along with this but the media acts like it's otherworldly and it's this horrible thing and it shouldn't be going on
[01:39:08.000 --> 01:39:17.000]  and he needs to be impeached because he's dared come out and speak out against these players that are hijacking these public events
[01:39:17.000 --> 01:39:22.000]  and grandstanding and injecting their George Soros garbage.
[01:39:22.000 --> 01:39:26.000]  So here's the president saying the NFL cannot disrespect our country.
[01:39:26.000 --> 01:39:40.000]  They cannot disrespect our flag or our national anthem and they can't have people sitting down or kneeling down during our national anthem.
[01:39:40.000 --> 01:39:44.000]  And I saw this a year ago with Kaepernick and I said, this is a terrible thing.
[01:39:44.000 --> 01:39:50.000]  I thought it was terrible and then it builds up a little bit and a little bit more and you see what's been happening and then all of a sudden you see more and more and more
[01:39:50.000 --> 01:39:58.000]  and I came out and I made a statement in Alabama the other day and I said I think it's very disrespectful to our country and the world picked it up
[01:39:58.000 --> 01:40:02.000]  and guess what most people agree with me and the NFL is in a box.
[01:40:02.000 --> 01:40:09.000]  They have to do something about it. They're disrespecting and when I say they, in a way it is they because they can stop it.
[01:40:09.000 --> 01:40:12.000]  You know they have rules for everything. You can't dance in the end zone.
[01:40:12.000 --> 01:40:19.000]  You can't wear the pink socks relative to breast cancer which one of the players, they have rules for everything.
[01:40:19.000 --> 01:40:25.000]  Why aren't they honoring this country by enforcing a rule that's been in existence for a long time?
[01:40:25.000 --> 01:40:32.000]  So the NFL and the players really have to do the honor of the countries for the honor of the country.
[01:40:32.000 --> 01:40:36.000]  They have to respect our country. They have to respect our flag and our anthem.
[01:40:36.000 --> 01:40:48.000]  That's just common sense but if they can convince you to hate your country and hate your flag as if all evil in the known universe is associated with it, they've won.
[01:40:48.000 --> 01:40:52.000]  But the good news is that's not working anymore.
[01:41:01.000 --> 01:41:07.000]  Now I'm going to play another clip here. We're going to go through these clips today.
[01:41:07.000 --> 01:41:14.000]  We're going to go ahead and go to this clip where we have MSM backs the NFL.
[01:41:14.000 --> 01:41:34.000]  This is just some of the sickening foaming at the mouth out of control evil that we've been seeing as the establishment tries to invoke total and complete disintegration of interpersonal activity in this country
[01:41:34.000 --> 01:41:41.000]  as they inject the most hardcore race based culture war garbage ever seen.
[01:41:41.000 --> 01:41:49.000]  So here is the report by Darren McBreen MSM backs NFL and they've lost big time.
[01:41:49.000 --> 01:41:56.000]  Their arrogance yet again has shown how delusional they are and how they don't know when to quit.
[01:41:56.000 --> 01:42:02.000]  Would you love to see one of these NFL owners when somebody disrespects our flag?
[01:42:02.000 --> 01:42:10.000]  Just say get that son of a bitch off the field right now out. He's fired. He's fired.
[01:42:10.000 --> 01:42:14.000]  We have breaking news tonight of the war between Donald Trump and the NFL.
[01:42:14.000 --> 01:42:17.000]  There is an unmistakable racial element to this story.
[01:42:17.000 --> 01:42:27.000]  It's hard to ignore the racial component here. The president went on this, went on this Jag on Friday night in front of a largely white audience.
[01:42:27.000 --> 01:42:34.000]  That is racism. You cannot deny it. You cannot run for it. You cannot kneel in honor of it.
[01:42:34.000 --> 01:42:42.000]  A lot of talk now about coded language. You think about what he said, disrespecting our heritage, we, to that largely white crowd.
[01:42:42.000 --> 01:42:47.000]  I think there's a lot of folks out there that look at this and say, what are you really trying to say here?
[01:42:47.000 --> 01:42:52.000]  This feels like a culture war that's exploding right before our eyes.
[01:42:52.000 --> 01:42:54.000]  Is he trying to wage something of a cultural war?
[01:42:54.000 --> 01:43:00.000]  Not at all. The president's not talking about race. The president's talking about pride in our country.
[01:43:00.000 --> 01:43:07.000]  What you saw yesterday were players and fans of all races joining together as Americans to honor our service members.
[01:43:07.000 --> 01:43:10.000]  That's what the president's talking about. That's what his focus is on.
[01:43:10.000 --> 01:43:17.000]  You're not going to find many voices of support outside his base, his extreme base.
[01:43:17.000 --> 01:43:19.000]  We have a white supremacist president in the United States.
[01:43:19.000 --> 01:43:24.000]  The president of the United States chose to pull the sheets off and reveal himself.
[01:43:24.000 --> 01:43:28.000]  He thinks apparently that he is the slave master of black people in the NFL.
[01:43:28.000 --> 01:43:30.000]  He wants us to be kneeling in the cotton fields again.
[01:43:30.000 --> 01:43:33.000]  The idea that this doesn't have something to do with race is preposterous.
[01:43:33.000 --> 01:43:38.000]  This country that he wants to make great again is all about making it white.
[01:43:38.000 --> 01:43:41.000]  His whole thing is when was America, make America great again.
[01:43:41.000 --> 01:43:51.000]  Now we see that 1817 is more likely when he's thinking about America being great as opposed to us kneeling on behalf of righteousness and justice.
[01:43:51.000 --> 01:43:54.000]  The national anthem is not a white supremacist symbol.
[01:43:54.000 --> 01:44:00.000]  Some of the words of the national anthem are white supremacists.
[01:44:00.000 --> 01:44:02.000]  You think the national anthem is racist?
[01:44:02.000 --> 01:44:05.000]  I think this is a country whose history is racist.
[01:44:05.000 --> 01:44:12.000]  The president of the United States came out attacking NFL players for them exercising the freedom of speech.
[01:44:12.000 --> 01:44:16.000]  Because that's a total disrespect of our heritage.
[01:44:16.000 --> 01:44:23.000]  That's a total disrespect of everything that we stand for, okay? Everything that we stand for.
[01:44:23.000 --> 01:44:36.000]  All right, listen, as they take it, he collectively, booze can be heard from this sell-out crowd in Arizona.
[01:44:36.000 --> 01:44:39.000]  I'm not sure if our president understands those rights.
[01:44:39.000 --> 01:44:45.000]  That every American has the right to speak out and also to protest.
[01:44:45.000 --> 01:44:50.000]  As a white father, having raised three boys, there were a million things to worry about on a daily basis.
[01:44:50.000 --> 01:44:58.000]  But it's impossible for me to truly understand the challenges that an African-American father faces at every turn while raising his children.
[01:44:58.000 --> 01:45:03.000]  It's like you're at the 50, you know, the 50 meter mark in a 100 meter dash.
[01:45:03.000 --> 01:45:07.000]  You've got that kind of a lead, yes, because you were born white.
[01:45:07.000 --> 01:45:11.000]  While these players, they've got feelings, they've got emotions, they've got opinions,
[01:45:11.000 --> 01:45:14.000]  and many of the players I spoke to feel that their voice is not being heard.
[01:45:14.000 --> 01:45:20.000]  And more specifically, that the president's comments on Friday, particularly calling them SOBs, were slapped in their face.
[01:45:20.000 --> 01:45:26.000]  One of the things, though, about football is that it always has a way of kind of unifying us and pulling us together.
[01:45:26.000 --> 01:45:33.000]  We hope that this unity that spread throughout the league yesterday will spread throughout America in the weeks of months to come.
[01:45:33.000 --> 01:45:46.000]  When people like yourselves turn on television, can you see those people taking the knee when they're playing our great national anthem?
[01:45:46.000 --> 01:45:51.000]  The only thing you can do better is if you see it, even if it's one player, leave the stadium.
[01:45:51.000 --> 01:45:58.000]  I guarantee things will stop. Things will stop. Just pick up and leave. Pick up and leave.
[01:45:58.000 --> 01:46:11.000]  Not the same game any more.
[01:46:11.000 --> 01:46:15.000]  Now, that's a little piece Darren McBreen put together.
[01:46:15.000 --> 01:46:20.000]  A guy, I'm suddenly a huge fan of. I watched some of his videos yesterday. I watched some last night.
[01:46:20.000 --> 01:46:24.000]  Probably all total an hour of my day. I spent watching Brandon Tatum videos.
[01:46:24.000 --> 01:46:33.000]  This is just a regular guy, a father, a bike enthusiast, common sense, 99,000 plus followers on his Facebook.
[01:46:33.000 --> 01:46:39.000]  And of course, he's an army veteran. That's some of the only common sense people left in this country.
[01:46:39.000 --> 01:46:45.000]  People that have been in the military and actually been through real diversity, been through real conflict,
[01:46:45.000 --> 01:46:50.000]  and know what the world's really made out of, not all these little delicate, protected snowflakes.
[01:46:50.000 --> 01:46:56.000]  And then you look at it, he's got 30 million views on one, 13 million views on another, 5 million views on another.
[01:46:56.000 --> 01:47:02.000]  A star is born. I want to get Brandon Tatum on the show as soon as possible,
[01:47:02.000 --> 01:47:06.000]  so we'll be actually having him up on that screen right there, and I'm not just watching him.
[01:47:06.000 --> 01:47:11.000]  Because that's what the show is about. It's about our platform sharing with other platforms,
[01:47:11.000 --> 01:47:17.000]  just to make the resistance bigger, to understand that, you know what, I was going to air Comedy Central attacking me
[01:47:17.000 --> 01:47:22.000]  the last three days in a row running with entire 30 minute programs each night.
[01:47:22.000 --> 01:47:26.000]  I haven't even had time to watch more than 10 minutes of it total,
[01:47:26.000 --> 01:47:30.000]  because I'm busy with my family around the dinner table, talking about stuff,
[01:47:30.000 --> 01:47:34.000]  and then watching videos like this guy on the big screen TV in our living room.
[01:47:34.000 --> 01:47:38.000]  I got the internet on our TV in the living room, and you know what I watch with my children?
[01:47:38.000 --> 01:47:41.000]  That veteran right there, Brandon Tatum.
[01:47:41.000 --> 01:47:46.000]  I didn't go last night and watch the attack on me.
[01:47:46.000 --> 01:47:50.000]  I didn't go watch the HBO shows lying about me or the showtime shows.
[01:47:50.000 --> 01:47:54.000]  I don't even watch the things anymore. People show me little boil down clips,
[01:47:54.000 --> 01:48:00.000]  because I'm too busy realizing they don't matter. This guy right here, this is what McBreen pointed out yesterday,
[01:48:00.000 --> 01:48:06.000]  has a reach this week of 39 million people as of last night.
[01:48:06.000 --> 01:48:11.000]  He's reached 39 million people this week. Let me tell you something right now.
[01:48:11.000 --> 01:48:15.000]  That new Comedy Central show won't reach that in a month.
[01:48:15.000 --> 01:48:20.000]  One guy in his car, 39 million people.
[01:48:20.000 --> 01:48:24.000]  He's done three videos this week with 39 million views on him.
[01:48:24.000 --> 01:48:29.000]  And what you say right here about the video we just played earlier, of the president.
[01:48:29.000 --> 01:48:34.000]  I love what Trump said, calm and to the point, Brandon Tatum.
[01:48:34.000 --> 01:48:39.000]  The NFL cannot disrespect our country. They cannot disrespect our flag or our national anthem.
[01:48:39.000 --> 01:48:46.000]  So, let's play what the people really want and resonate with.
[01:48:46.000 --> 01:48:51.000]  This is the real black man right here. Not the ones they force feed you all day on television,
[01:48:51.000 --> 01:48:54.000]  who think everybody's out to get them and have chips on their shoulders.
[01:48:54.000 --> 01:48:59.000]  Put there by the globalist. Put there by the real psychological warfare plantation
[01:48:59.000 --> 01:49:02.000]  of the Democratic Party that wants to control everybody.
[01:49:02.000 --> 01:49:07.000]  And the Republican establishment trying to be part of that, who knows they're being routed right now
[01:49:07.000 --> 01:49:14.000]  and removed in a major global insurrection against the New World Order.
[01:49:14.000 --> 01:49:20.000]  Oh, I'm sorry. I was saying this had 30 something million views.
[01:49:20.000 --> 01:49:29.000]  I'm sorry. It's got 40 million views. See how people always say, oh Alex, you say Paul Watson's got a video with 20 million views.
[01:49:29.000 --> 01:49:32.000]  Let me go look it up. It's got 35 million views.
[01:49:32.000 --> 01:49:38.000]  So, there's a bunch of channels here. I guess he's got 13 million on one channel and 40 something on another.
[01:49:38.000 --> 01:49:43.000]  See that? That's what I mean. I'm telling you, he's got 39 million people reached with all three of the videos together.
[01:49:43.000 --> 01:49:47.000]  I'm sorry. It's probably 60 million now. I can't even keep track of this.
[01:49:47.000 --> 01:49:53.000]  People think I'm exaggerating. It's almost always better or worse than I'm saying.
[01:49:53.000 --> 01:49:57.000]  So, here's a guy with one video. Look at him, your TV viewer.
[01:49:57.000 --> 01:50:06.000]  This guy has 40 million views on one video. 13 million on another. All this stuff.
[01:50:06.000 --> 01:50:11.000]  Where is he on the news? Oh, you'll hear about it next week.
[01:50:11.000 --> 01:50:18.000]  And he'll be so honored to, I guess, go on Fox or CNN for a minute when they got like a third of viewers this guy has every day.
[01:50:18.000 --> 01:50:22.000]  We're the future. You are the future.
[01:50:22.000 --> 01:50:29.000]  And they make fun of us on Comedy Central because some of our guests and reporters report from their cars or from their homes.
[01:50:29.000 --> 01:50:38.000]  That was the attack last night. I didn't watch it last night. They showed me a clip this morning where they were making fun of our reporters.
[01:50:38.000 --> 01:50:45.000]  They admit the show's based on us that, oh, some of those reporters like Leon McAdoo, they report from their living rooms.
[01:50:45.000 --> 01:50:53.000]  We could sit there and give her a big studio. We got big studios to kind of traffic cop all this, but we want people in a car.
[01:50:53.000 --> 01:50:58.000]  Let me explain something. I found with our reporters, if they go do a report in a car, it gets a million views.
[01:50:58.000 --> 01:51:03.000]  They do a report in this fancy studio. It gets 100,000 views.
[01:51:03.000 --> 01:51:11.000]  What does that tell you? People are sick of the establishment. They're sick of slick. They're sick of it. They associate it with BS.
[01:51:11.000 --> 01:51:21.000]  They associate it with garbage. So let's analyze this Brandon Tatum, who's got several of the most viral videos this week for telling it like it is.
[01:51:21.000 --> 01:51:27.000]  Here's what they don't want you to hear. Here it is.
[01:51:27.000 --> 01:51:41.000]  All right. We're going to talk, but now y'all that made me talk. So look, this is my whole thing about this protesting and it's taking a knee on the flag.
[01:51:41.000 --> 01:51:46.000]  For all you people who just seem to not understand, let me clarify this for you.
[01:51:46.000 --> 01:51:57.000]  Okay. It's not about the act of protesting. It's not about the act of believing in something and pursuing it.
[01:51:57.000 --> 01:52:07.000]  It's the way you're doing it. I don't know how many times people have to say this. Listen, what does the American flag have to do with your perceived oppression?
[01:52:07.000 --> 01:52:20.000]  What does the national anthem have to do with these issues that people are bringing up? It is a separate issue. The flag and the national anthem has nothing to do with what you're talking about.
[01:52:20.000 --> 01:52:33.000]  You're talking about an anthem of hope and unity within this country that have made people become great, that have made the poor become rich and give people opportunities.
[01:52:33.000 --> 01:52:42.000]  You're just talking about a flag that represents hard work, dedication, blood, sweat and tears, sacrifice.
[01:52:42.000 --> 01:52:55.000]  And the thing that makes me most upset is that you have these people who turn around and take a name and want to attribute all the negativity to the flag and the anthem, but don't want to attribute the positive.
[01:52:55.000 --> 01:53:12.000]  Listen, if you feel that the American flag represents negativity and slavery and all this other stuff, then you have to give credit and credence to a flag that have given you an opportunity to go from cornfields and pickin' cotton to be the president of the United States of America.
[01:53:12.000 --> 01:53:21.000]  Going from being segregated, can't go to proper schools, can't vote, takin' you from that point and then you're making millions of dollars to play sports.
[01:53:21.000 --> 01:53:28.000]  And you know who's watching you, white people. I'm sick of y'all coming up with these lame excuses.
[01:53:28.000 --> 01:53:35.000]  The reason why America isn't... listen, Martin Luther King had support, you could call it bipartisan support.
[01:53:35.000 --> 01:53:42.000]  He had support on both sides, from people in the movement and people outside of the movement, because he did it with respect.
[01:53:42.000 --> 01:54:00.000]  He did it with that Robin Peter the PayPal. He did it with integrity. He did it with the mission. He did it with tangible goals that were achievable through hope, faith and dedication and unity and connectivity between all of us.
[01:54:00.000 --> 01:54:09.000]  These clowns are doing stuff off of trendiness. This is trendy. The issues they're talking about have nothing to do with the flag.
[01:54:09.000 --> 01:54:18.000]  You can address those issues on another venue. If you really care about black lives, you don't need to be takin' a knee.
[01:54:18.000 --> 01:54:25.000]  You need to be out there doing something in the community. If you care about oppression, if you care about laws, then you need to be voting.
[01:54:25.000 --> 01:54:30.000]  You need to be puttin' yourself in position to assist in passing legislation.
[01:54:30.000 --> 01:54:35.000]  And then one of y'all need to take the step and say, okay, I'm gonna join the police department.
[01:54:35.000 --> 01:54:40.000]  Do something about it. Quit takin' a knee and protestin' and cryin' like a baby.
[01:54:40.000 --> 01:54:46.000]  Because at the end of the day, all you're doin' is pissin' people off. That's all you're doin'.
[01:54:46.000 --> 01:54:52.000]  I ask the personal that people cannot answer this question. What has happened since Colin Kaepernick took the first knee?
[01:54:52.000 --> 01:54:59.000]  What has happened? Have unemployment changed in the black community? Have black on black crime changed? Have police stopped shooting black people?
[01:54:59.000 --> 01:55:07.000]  Tell me what has changed. Has abortion rate dropped? Has residency changed? Has dropout rates changed?
[01:55:07.000 --> 01:55:10.000]  Tell me what has changed since he took a knee.
[01:55:10.000 --> 01:55:17.000]  Somehow there's more entrepreneurs, more opportunities, more jobs. What has changed?
[01:55:17.000 --> 01:55:22.000]  Nothin'. Nothin' has changed. Nothin' is gonna change.
[01:55:22.000 --> 01:55:30.000]  Stop windin' like a baby, suit up, play the sport, play the game, and actually do something about it.
[01:55:30.000 --> 01:55:34.000]  Stop draggin' a flag in it if you're gonna cry about it on one end.
[01:55:34.000 --> 01:55:35.000]  It pause.
[01:55:35.000 --> 01:55:36.000]  But you don't wanna get...
[01:55:36.000 --> 01:55:40.000]  My children have been askin' me what all this stuff's about, and I don't even know how to address it to them.
[01:55:40.000 --> 01:55:46.000]  I just say it's a bunch of people being mind controlled. The people on the field are baby puppets and it's trendy to try to break the country up.
[01:55:46.000 --> 01:55:51.000]  And then I can just show my children this and then they totally get it. And that's what's great. This guy needs to run for Congress.
[01:55:51.000 --> 01:55:56.000]  I'm telling you, that's not office script right there. This guy, he can say it, but I'm gonna say it.
[01:55:56.000 --> 01:56:00.000]  They go, it's patronizing, they're callin' a black guy smart. No, I call Trump smart. He's a white guy.
[01:56:00.000 --> 01:56:07.000]  This guy can crystallize it and really boil it down better than I can. This guy needs to be on talk radio.
[01:56:07.000 --> 01:56:10.000]  This guy needs to be on TV. And this guy needs to run for Congress.
[01:56:10.000 --> 01:56:17.000]  I said, man, this video's really good. I went and watched some of the other ones. Just, he really is amazing.
[01:56:17.000 --> 01:56:23.000]  And that's what we need is the truth, folks. He says everything I'm trying to say in hours.
[01:56:23.000 --> 01:56:32.000]  It's just so frustrating. It's so stupid. It's so mindless. And the people being chumped into doing it are just that chumps.
[01:56:32.000 --> 01:56:37.000]  So Brandon Tatum is a great guy and we want to get him on the show ASAP.
[01:56:37.000 --> 01:56:42.000]  The full video is up on infowars.com. I'm gonna retweet it out right now at Real Alex Jones.
[01:56:42.000 --> 01:56:47.000]  But there's a reason that what he's saying has tens of millions of views.
[01:56:47.000 --> 01:56:54.000]  And if CNN or MSNBC or Fox News just put out common sense, they'd be great again as well.
[01:56:54.000 --> 01:57:01.000]  They'd have 20, 30 million viewers a night like they used to. But people tune into most of Fox. It's as bad as CNN.
[01:57:01.000 --> 01:57:07.000]  People ask, Alex, how do you reach 30, 40, 50, 60 million people a week? How do you continue to do all this?
[01:57:07.000 --> 01:57:13.000]  I'm just somebody like Brandon Tatum that came along before he didn't got a media operation.
[01:57:13.000 --> 01:57:18.000]  I guarantee it was somebody like Brandon Tatum watching a syndicated show with that guy.
[01:57:18.000 --> 01:57:24.000]  Getting behind him. Hundreds of radio stations. He could host a three hour show every day.
[01:57:24.000 --> 01:57:30.000]  He's just gonna cover the topics and look at the common sense angles of it of how it really affects people. Amazing.
[01:57:30.000 --> 01:57:34.000]  That's just one of the videos. That's not the whole thing. It's up on infowars.com. We're on his site.
[01:57:34.000 --> 01:57:38.000]  Brandon Tatum on Facebook. Sometimes you got to log in. So, I mean, the video's everywhere.
[01:57:38.000 --> 01:57:42.000]  And I'd seen it a few days before and thank God, McBrain told me, he goes, why aren't you playing this?
[01:57:42.000 --> 01:57:48.000]  And I said, why aren't you telling me to play it? You know? I know. I need to be reminded about this kind of stuff.
[01:57:48.000 --> 01:57:53.000]  And then I told the crew today, I said, look, don't wait for me to tell you to get a guess like that.
[01:57:53.000 --> 01:57:56.000]  Do you see some guy with 30 million views and it's powerful. Get him on the show.
[01:57:56.000 --> 01:58:02.000]  And again, by the time I saw it later, it was 40-something million views. So, there you go, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:58:02.000 --> 01:58:06.000]  I was telling him, I go, why does it only have 13 million? The one I saw had 37 million.
[01:58:06.000 --> 01:58:11.000]  At 38, they go, this is the video. That was a copy of it. It had 13 million.
[01:58:11.000 --> 01:58:17.000]  Woo! Who bought them TVs? Ladies, tell me that. I love it.
[01:58:17.000 --> 01:58:23.000]  He's got something and it's super bad. You got it too, folks. Everybody who wants to be free.
[01:58:23.000 --> 01:58:27.000]  The truth is sexy. It's the real deal and it's winning.

[01:59:50.000 --> 01:59:54.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:59:57.000 --> 02:00:02.000]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[02:00:02.000 --> 02:00:12.000]  Watch me. Watch me. I got it. Watch me. I got it. Hey!
[02:00:12.000 --> 02:00:20.000]  I got something that makes me want to shout. I got something that tells me what it's all about.
[02:00:20.000 --> 02:00:22.000]  I got stone.
[02:00:22.000 --> 02:00:24.000]  And I'm super bad.
[02:00:25.000 --> 02:00:29.000]  Did you guys hear me do that and find that song like 30 seconds?
[02:00:29.000 --> 02:00:33.000]  Haha, yeah. James Brown bringing us in.
[02:00:43.000 --> 02:00:47.000]  I love it. I got a move that tells me what to do.
[02:00:47.000 --> 02:00:51.000]  I feel so nice. I'm gonna call myself a few.
[02:00:51.000 --> 02:00:55.000]  I got stone. And I'm super bad.
[02:00:55.000 --> 02:00:58.000]  Super bad and good wife.
[02:00:58.000 --> 02:01:03.000]  I love it. I like to do my thing.
[02:01:03.000 --> 02:01:09.000]  And I don't need no one else.
[02:01:09.000 --> 02:01:13.000]  Sometimes I feel so nice. Good thought.
[02:01:13.000 --> 02:01:19.000]  Well, they just popped in so they can watch that fellow we were just playing earlier,
[02:01:19.000 --> 02:01:23.000]  Brandon Tatum's followers exploding on Facebook as we go.
[02:01:23.000 --> 02:01:27.000]  And it's about those evil racist white people going in there to watch him.
[02:01:27.000 --> 02:01:32.000]  Yeah, actually the folks who just want to live in peace and are looking for somebody to get along with.
[02:01:32.000 --> 02:01:36.000]  See, the globalists don't want that. They're upset about it.
[02:01:36.000 --> 02:01:38.000]  They're trying to stop it as much as they can.
[02:01:38.000 --> 02:01:44.000]  Let's go ahead and finish up with the end of what Brandon Tatum was saying with the viral video now
[02:01:44.000 --> 02:01:51.000]  with 40 plus million views on one channel, 13 million views on another channel.
[02:01:51.000 --> 02:01:54.000]  It's just amazing. And this is just the last few days.
[02:01:54.000 --> 02:01:58.000]  It'll probably go to 100 million unless Facebook does what they've done to us.
[02:01:58.000 --> 02:02:06.000]  Every time I get a video or more often Paul Watson gets a video hits 35 million, they delete that sucker.
[02:02:06.000 --> 02:02:10.000]  I tell you, they're a bunch of sick felt. Here it is.
[02:02:10.000 --> 02:02:15.000]  Play the sport, play the game and actually do something about it.
[02:02:15.000 --> 02:02:17.000]  Start dragging the flag in it.
[02:02:17.000 --> 02:02:23.000]  If you're going to cry about it on one end, but you don't want to give credence to it on the other end.
[02:02:23.000 --> 02:02:28.000]  I'm telling you, as an African American man in this country, the flag means a lot to me.
[02:02:28.000 --> 02:02:31.000]  I honored the flag. I don't care if I don't like the president.
[02:02:31.000 --> 02:02:34.000]  I don't give a care about none of that stuff.
[02:02:34.000 --> 02:02:36.000]  I'm not going to disrespect the flag.
[02:02:36.000 --> 02:02:40.000]  I'm going to honor the people who fought for I can be free.
[02:02:40.000 --> 02:02:41.000]  That's it.
[02:02:41.000 --> 02:02:44.000]  If I don't do nothing else, I'm going to honor those people.
[02:02:44.000 --> 02:02:46.000]  Presidents come and go.
[02:02:46.000 --> 02:02:50.000]  Four years, eight years, they out.
[02:02:50.000 --> 02:02:53.000]  And I'm sick of you athletes. I was an athlete.
[02:02:53.000 --> 02:02:56.000]  I'm sick of y'all trying to act like just because you played in the NFL,
[02:02:56.000 --> 02:02:59.000]  you play sports somehow, somehow you an expert on life.
[02:02:59.000 --> 02:03:02.000]  You have no idea what you're talking about.
[02:03:02.000 --> 02:03:04.000]  Listen, you play a game.
[02:03:04.000 --> 02:03:06.000]  This is fairytale world.
[02:03:06.000 --> 02:03:08.000]  You suit up. You lose. You go home.
[02:03:08.000 --> 02:03:10.000]  You cry. You play another game.
[02:03:10.000 --> 02:03:18.000]  In the real world, real heroes, when they lose games, they don't come back.
[02:03:18.000 --> 02:03:20.000]  When the game is over, there's no takebacks.
[02:03:20.000 --> 02:03:23.000]  When you lose, you die.
[02:03:23.000 --> 02:03:25.000]  That's real men.
[02:03:25.000 --> 02:03:30.000]  You make it tackles. I'm saving lives.
[02:03:30.000 --> 02:03:35.000]  Don't come at me with that BS about being some sports player.
[02:03:35.000 --> 02:03:37.000]  You're playing a game.
[02:03:37.000 --> 02:03:40.000]  You're playing a game.
[02:03:40.000 --> 02:03:43.000]  The people who die for that flag, it ain't a game.
[02:03:43.000 --> 02:03:48.000]  That's real life. That's real sacrifice.
[02:03:48.000 --> 02:03:50.000]  Don't come at me with that.
[02:03:50.000 --> 02:03:51.000]  That's all I have to say.
[02:03:51.000 --> 02:03:54.000]  Y'all didn't make me mad.
[02:03:54.000 --> 02:03:56.000]  This country is greater than that.
[02:03:56.000 --> 02:04:00.000]  All you clown athletes, you ain't nothing.
[02:04:00.000 --> 02:04:03.000]  And I'm going to say this and I'm out here for real this time.
[02:04:03.000 --> 02:04:06.000]  Listen, Donald Trump is a millionaire
[02:04:06.000 --> 02:04:11.000]  who's now the leader of the greatest country that ever existed.
[02:04:11.000 --> 02:04:13.000]  Cry me a river.
[02:04:13.000 --> 02:04:14.000]  He ain't worried about you.
[02:04:14.000 --> 02:04:16.000]  Cry baby athletes.
[02:04:16.000 --> 02:04:19.000]  You are here today, gone tomorrow.
[02:04:19.000 --> 02:04:22.000]  Relevant today, you ain't signed tomorrow.
[02:04:22.000 --> 02:04:25.000]  You have a leg injury, you are irrelevant.
[02:04:25.000 --> 02:04:27.000]  Remember that.
[02:04:27.000 --> 02:04:29.000]  Remember who paid your salary.
[02:04:29.000 --> 02:04:32.000]  Remember who's filling these seats that's paying you money.
[02:04:32.000 --> 02:04:35.000]  You ain't making money just because you're a good athlete.
[02:04:35.000 --> 02:04:37.000]  You're making money because people want to watch you.
[02:04:37.000 --> 02:04:39.000]  People are supporting you.
[02:04:39.000 --> 02:04:40.000]  We got to go to break.
[02:04:40.000 --> 02:04:43.000]  And as you heard, this guy just coming out of nowhere,
[02:04:43.000 --> 02:04:44.000]  you made me mad.
[02:04:44.000 --> 02:04:48.000]  See, they're pushing regular Americans from just doing their jobs,
[02:04:48.000 --> 02:04:51.000]  being the real unsung heroes out in the open.
[02:04:51.000 --> 02:04:53.000]  That's what this tyranny's doing.
[02:04:53.000 --> 02:04:55.000]  What the NFL pull on this did.
[02:05:24.000 --> 02:05:27.000]  Independence isn't a day.
[02:05:27.000 --> 02:05:28.000]  It's a mindset.
[02:05:28.000 --> 02:05:31.000]  An attitude that says, I will not be your dependent.
[02:05:31.000 --> 02:05:33.000]  I will not be your slave.
[02:05:33.000 --> 02:05:37.000]  Dependence and slavery is a chain that is forged link by link
[02:05:37.000 --> 02:05:39.000]  with gradual infringements.
[02:05:39.000 --> 02:05:41.000]  When you trade your liberty for safety,
[02:05:41.000 --> 02:05:44.000]  to that extent, you become their slave.
[02:05:44.000 --> 02:05:46.000]  Slaves are never safe.
[02:05:46.000 --> 02:05:49.000]  You won't get rich by being a slave.
[02:05:49.000 --> 02:05:50.000]  Guard your liberty.
[02:05:50.000 --> 02:05:53.000]  In regard with suspicion, anyone who tries to take it.
[02:05:53.000 --> 02:06:22.000]  For EverWars.com, I'm David Dyke.
[02:06:23.000 --> 02:06:26.000]  Unions added to the food and water and to the lining of plastics
[02:06:26.000 --> 02:06:29.000]  that destroy our vitality, turn off our hormones,
[02:06:29.000 --> 02:06:32.000]  and accelerate our journey towards death.
[02:06:32.000 --> 02:06:35.000]  I personally counter this onslaught with Anthroplex.

[02:08:23.000 --> 02:08:26.000]  All right, get ready. I'm opening the phones up
[02:08:26.000 --> 02:08:28.000]  and I'm taking your phone calls one after the other.
[02:08:28.000 --> 02:08:31.000]  I don't care how good they are. I don't care how bad they are.
[02:08:31.000 --> 02:08:34.000]  I don't care how great a point you're making. I'm giving each person a minute.
[02:08:34.000 --> 02:08:37.000]  I'm doing a 15-second comment and we're moving past them
[02:08:37.000 --> 02:08:41.000]  because I used to, ten years ago, be able to take 100 calls a day.
[02:08:41.000 --> 02:08:44.000]  People liked it when I did that but I would move through them fast
[02:08:44.000 --> 02:08:48.000]  and I've got caught in some little warp area where the caller's great.
[02:08:48.000 --> 02:08:52.000]  You know, I talked to him a long time and then I go into the next segment
[02:08:52.000 --> 02:08:54.000]  and I do a 10-minute rant and we don't get to anybody.
[02:08:54.000 --> 02:08:56.000]  I'm doing it right now.
[02:08:56.000 --> 02:08:59.000]  800-259-9231.
[02:08:59.000 --> 02:09:05.000]  800-259-9231 is the toll-free number to join us.
[02:09:05.000 --> 02:09:08.000]  And all I ask is you got a good phone, a good connection
[02:09:08.000 --> 02:09:11.000]  and ready to make your points on the NFL, on North Korea,
[02:09:11.000 --> 02:09:15.000]  on one of my new favorite talk shows, Brandon Tatum,
[02:09:15.000 --> 02:09:20.000]  with his top viral videos destroying the globalists in their entire paradigm
[02:09:20.000 --> 02:09:24.000]  and laying out the facts just exactly as I've been thinking
[02:09:24.000 --> 02:09:29.000]  and trying to say, it's like he literally was channeling truth.
[02:09:29.000 --> 02:09:32.000]  Like, you know, you can have an image in your mind and know a truth
[02:09:32.000 --> 02:09:35.000]  and have all the facts and try to present it and you're like,
[02:09:35.000 --> 02:09:38.000]  it just gets jumbled up because there's so much.
[02:09:38.000 --> 02:09:40.000]  He just did it flawlessly.
[02:09:40.000 --> 02:09:45.000]  It's perfect.
[02:09:45.000 --> 02:09:50.000]  And of course, it's an army veteran patriot.
[02:09:50.000 --> 02:09:52.000]  And again, I'm not lionizing people in the military.
[02:09:52.000 --> 02:09:54.000]  There's bad folks in the military, good folks in the military,
[02:09:54.000 --> 02:09:56.000]  but statistically over and over again, you're running into folks
[02:09:56.000 --> 02:09:58.000]  that have been in the military that actually care for something
[02:09:58.000 --> 02:10:02.000]  in this world where there's all these spoiled, rotten people everywhere
[02:10:02.000 --> 02:10:04.000]  who don't give a, you know what, about anything.
[02:10:04.000 --> 02:10:08.000]  And I'm not talking about black people when I do say that.
[02:10:08.000 --> 02:10:10.000]  I'm talking about people in general.
[02:10:10.000 --> 02:10:12.000]  But you look at those spoiled, rotten football players
[02:10:12.000 --> 02:10:15.000]  buying into trendiness and brainwashing
[02:10:15.000 --> 02:10:18.000]  and Hollywood's hate for America being used as pawns,
[02:10:18.000 --> 02:10:22.000]  that's wrong and that's stupid.
[02:10:22.000 --> 02:10:27.000]  And it makes me so angry to see people being used as pawns.
[02:10:27.000 --> 02:10:29.000]  Because let me tell you something.
[02:10:29.000 --> 02:10:32.000]  When you get some wound up, crazy, racist black guy
[02:10:32.000 --> 02:10:33.000]  going in and shooting up the church
[02:10:33.000 --> 02:10:36.000]  or hitting some white, Polish immigrant in the head with a hammer,
[02:10:36.000 --> 02:10:40.000]  I mean, I see these reports every day where racist, brainwashed black people
[02:10:40.000 --> 02:10:42.000]  go out and kill white people.
[02:10:42.000 --> 02:10:44.000]  And it doesn't mean that I hate black people in general.
[02:10:44.000 --> 02:10:47.000]  I understand the weak-minded people go out and do it,
[02:10:47.000 --> 02:10:50.000]  just like the weak-minded white guy that went in and shot the nine people
[02:10:50.000 --> 02:10:53.000]  at the black church, brainwashed by his own garbage.
[02:10:53.000 --> 02:10:57.000]  But can you imagine if the media was telling white people
[02:10:57.000 --> 02:10:59.000]  to go out and kill black people or go out and attack them?
[02:10:59.000 --> 02:11:02.000]  You'd have more mentally deranged people pick up on that
[02:11:02.000 --> 02:11:04.000]  and go out and do it.
[02:11:04.000 --> 02:11:06.000]  A lot of folks are weak-minded.
[02:11:06.000 --> 02:11:08.000]  You give them the moral support for something, it's over.
[02:11:08.000 --> 02:11:11.000]  That's what's so dangerous about mainstream media saying that,
[02:11:11.000 --> 02:11:13.000]  you know, oh, Trump wants slaves
[02:11:13.000 --> 02:11:15.000]  and he wants to put black people on plantations
[02:11:15.000 --> 02:11:18.000]  and he's secretly a KKK member
[02:11:18.000 --> 02:11:22.000]  and white people want to kill all the blacks and all this stuff.
[02:11:22.000 --> 02:11:28.000]  Hyping this thing up just to create division, it's horrible.
[02:11:28.000 --> 02:11:32.000]  But they do the polls out there and they say that this is backfired.
[02:11:32.000 --> 02:11:37.000]  All this racial division is backfired, just like the garbage with the NFL.
[02:11:37.000 --> 02:11:40.000]  Man, I tell you, Sunday, Monday, they were arrogant on Trump.
[02:11:40.000 --> 02:11:41.000]  You tried it with us.
[02:11:41.000 --> 02:11:43.000]  All their commentators had the talking point.
[02:11:43.000 --> 02:11:45.000]  You just got your butt handed to you.
[02:11:45.000 --> 02:11:49.000]  You just saw the unity of the NFL.
[02:11:49.000 --> 02:11:52.000]  It didn't matter in what poll it was, the vast majority of blacks,
[02:11:52.000 --> 02:11:55.000]  not just whites or anybody else said, we don't like this.
[02:11:55.000 --> 02:11:57.000]  We don't want to watch a football game
[02:11:57.000 --> 02:12:00.000]  and don't want to sit there and hear about how America's bad
[02:12:00.000 --> 02:12:06.000]  and how white people are evil and it's a joke.
[02:12:06.000 --> 02:12:13.000]  And it's been said, Trump has ESPN thinking what they're actually thinking.
[02:12:13.000 --> 02:12:17.000]  CNN, ESPN, all of them are a bunch of America hating garbage
[02:12:17.000 --> 02:12:24.000]  and Trump has them now speaking and saying on air
[02:12:24.000 --> 02:12:28.000]  what they've always really thought.
[02:12:28.000 --> 02:12:32.000]  And it's crazy because you get people in an echo chamber
[02:12:32.000 --> 02:12:35.000]  with a bunch of leftist coaches and a bunch of leftist Hollywood owners
[02:12:35.000 --> 02:12:40.000]  and then they sit there and they go out and they program folks to believe this crap.
[02:12:40.000 --> 02:12:42.000]  It's shameful.
[02:12:42.000 --> 02:12:45.000]  And let me tell you something, it's hurting those players
[02:12:45.000 --> 02:12:51.000]  and it's hurting the average weak-minded person that buys into this.
[02:12:51.000 --> 02:12:56.000]  Yeah, Skip Bayless is upset that a former Army Ranger stood for the National Anthem,
[02:12:56.000 --> 02:13:00.000]  but don't worry, Bayless held a fundraiser for Hillary Clinton
[02:13:00.000 --> 02:13:06.000]  and then he got the Army Ranger to come out and say he was sorry.
[02:13:06.000 --> 02:13:13.000]  You talk about bullying by the white slave master, that's slavery.
[02:13:13.000 --> 02:13:22.000]  When you tell the Army veteran, we're going to fire you if you don't come out and say
[02:13:22.000 --> 02:13:27.000]  that America is basically bad and that you shouldn't have gone out with your hand over your heart
[02:13:27.000 --> 02:13:29.000]  and that you screwed over your team.
[02:13:29.000 --> 02:13:38.000]  No, the team screwed over America because the owner and the coach are dirtbag globalists
[02:13:38.000 --> 02:13:42.000]  who are following a Hollywood line to bully everybody into submission.
[02:13:42.000 --> 02:13:45.000]  It's not that America is perfect, America's got a lot of problems.
[02:13:45.000 --> 02:13:50.000]  It's that outside globalist forces are trying to get us all killing each other.
[02:13:50.000 --> 02:13:55.000]  That's the issue here.
[02:13:55.000 --> 02:14:00.000]  And anybody that studied history, anybody that studied warfare, anybody that studied propaganda,
[02:14:00.000 --> 02:14:07.000]  anybody who's got one lick of sense, anybody that's got common smarts, street smarts,
[02:14:07.000 --> 02:14:09.000]  could see this coming a mile away.
[02:14:09.000 --> 02:14:13.000]  This is ridiculous.
[02:14:13.000 --> 02:14:18.000]  And we're routing it 110%.
[02:14:18.000 --> 02:14:23.000]  The NFL's got its tail between its legs and has hired all these PR experts that are Democrats,
[02:14:23.000 --> 02:14:28.000]  of course, to decide how to spin this and how to get out in front of it and how to stop it.
[02:14:28.000 --> 02:14:29.000]  Let me tell you something.
[02:14:29.000 --> 02:14:31.000]  You're not going to stop anything now.
[02:14:31.000 --> 02:14:35.000]  You have wounded yourself and you're not going to be able to stop coming back with this
[02:14:35.000 --> 02:14:38.000]  and you've really shown people who you are.
[02:14:38.000 --> 02:14:43.000]  So good luck putting that sucker back together again.
[02:14:43.000 --> 02:14:50.000]  Trump's gotten $400 plus billion in investment in eight months, almost $4 trillion in the stock market.
[02:14:50.000 --> 02:14:54.000]  Carbon taxes are killed.
[02:14:54.000 --> 02:14:56.000]  It goes on and on.
[02:14:56.000 --> 02:15:01.000]  And now 3.1% growth rate, things that they thought could never happen.
[02:15:01.000 --> 02:15:06.000]  And a great new tax plan, if they just hold spending at the same level, which Trump's calling for,
[02:15:06.000 --> 02:15:10.000]  that will absolutely turbocharge our economy and begin to pay down the debt.
[02:15:10.000 --> 02:15:14.000]  I mean, Trump's really making a run at this and he's signaling executive orders,
[02:15:14.000 --> 02:15:19.000]  not letting Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac money go to proper Obamacare that'll kill it,
[02:15:19.000 --> 02:15:24.000]  debt it to Hammer, before it can suck everything out of the U.S. economy and then implode it
[02:15:24.000 --> 02:15:31.000]  and then bring in something even worse, which is what Pocahontas and Ezekiel Emanuel
[02:15:31.000 --> 02:15:35.000]  and Jonathan Gruber, who says you're stupid and who hates you.
[02:15:35.000 --> 02:15:40.000]  I mean, you talk about Facing the Crowd, where this talk show host has everybody loving him,
[02:15:40.000 --> 02:15:45.000]  but they leave the mic on, he talks about how much he hates his audience and how they're schmucks.
[02:15:45.000 --> 02:15:51.000]  Jonathan Gruber and Obama have all been caught on hot mics and in private events saying they hate your ass.
[02:15:51.000 --> 02:15:55.000]  They hate black people. They hate white people. They hate poor people.
[02:15:55.000 --> 02:15:59.000]  They're sociopaths. They don't have big hearts. They don't want to have wealth.
[02:15:59.000 --> 02:16:03.000]  They don't want to have a rising tide. They're not Donald Trump.
[02:16:03.000 --> 02:16:08.000]  They want to make you poor and make you on your knees having to kiss their ass.
[02:16:08.000 --> 02:16:14.000]  Excuse me. I'm going to stop that. I apologize. I'm just really angry.
[02:16:14.000 --> 02:16:18.000]  And when I hold back that kind of stuff, because I'm not a guy that uses a lot of profanity behind the scenes,
[02:16:18.000 --> 02:16:22.000]  but when I get mad, I do sometimes, and I just want to turn it loose and say what I really think,
[02:16:22.000 --> 02:16:27.000]  so I turn off the governor so I can really speak well, and then there's no governor!
[02:16:27.000 --> 02:16:35.000]  And so I'm going to get really angry because I'm not out to get anybody getting out to get me.
[02:16:35.000 --> 02:16:39.000]  And I'm tired of seeing everybody get played by these people.
[02:16:39.000 --> 02:16:42.000]  I don't like the con artists. I don't like the scam artists.
[02:16:42.000 --> 02:16:46.000]  I want to see them knocked upside the head with a club politically.
[02:16:46.000 --> 02:16:52.000]  I want to see them knocked out in the ditch, not squatting on top of everybody, running our lives!
[02:16:52.000 --> 02:16:57.000]  Because they're better than everybody! You want to talk about elitism, you want to talk about classism,
[02:16:57.000 --> 02:17:01.000]  you want to talk about racism, you want to talk about manipulation, you want to talk about control.
[02:17:01.000 --> 02:17:06.000]  That's these people telling everybody they can't have a good future, can't have a good life.
[02:17:06.000 --> 02:17:10.000]  Telling you you've got to be poor for the environment while they all live like kings.
[02:17:10.000 --> 02:17:14.000]  These are elitist sociopaths that hate your ass.
[02:17:14.000 --> 02:17:19.000]  And everybody better get that through your heads.
[02:17:19.000 --> 02:17:26.000]  All these pseudo-intellectuals, all of them, they always get some chicken-neck, skinny, fake white guy up there
[02:17:26.000 --> 02:17:30.000]  like this comedy-central guy and all up there to talk down their noses to us.
[02:17:30.000 --> 02:17:35.000]  Like we're not smart and talk about how smart they are reading out their teleprompters all day
[02:17:35.000 --> 02:17:39.000]  because they're going to act all intellectual and act all elitist when all they are is little mercenaries
[02:17:39.000 --> 02:17:43.000]  that read off a teleprompter and hate their own country and think they're better than everybody
[02:17:43.000 --> 02:17:48.000]  and they're sitting there kissing ass to get pieces of crumbs from the psychotic establishment
[02:17:48.000 --> 02:17:53.000]  hoping they can get into the vampire ranks politically to feed on everybody.
[02:17:53.000 --> 02:17:58.000]  When they didn't know they came a day late and a dollar short when the whole thing's coming down, dumbasses.
[02:17:58.000 --> 02:18:03.000]  You signed on to the whole New World Order when it had the wheels coming off.
[02:18:03.000 --> 02:18:08.000]  When it was up to its axles in mind.
[02:18:08.000 --> 02:18:14.000]  You're going to be hated. Your grandchildren are going to know you were a traitor.
[02:18:14.000 --> 02:18:19.000]  You're not going to beat us. You understand that? We've already broken your back.
[02:18:19.000 --> 02:18:24.000]  And you're crawling. You're crawling at us so we kick you in the teeth.
[02:18:24.000 --> 02:18:29.000]  Knock your teeth out. You're still rolling around on the ground thinking you're in charge.
[02:18:29.000 --> 02:18:34.000]  So we start putting the boots to your ribs.
[02:18:34.000 --> 02:18:40.000]  That we've gotten to the point where I'm just going to walk away
[02:18:40.000 --> 02:18:45.000]  and your friends are going to land buzzards carrying crows
[02:18:45.000 --> 02:18:50.000]  and they're going to hop over politically and they're going to tear your eyeballs out of your skull and your tongue
[02:18:50.000 --> 02:18:55.000]  and then they're going to sit there and peck out your eyeballs and eat your brain live.
[02:18:55.000 --> 02:19:02.000]  The last thing you're ever going to be thinking is, man, I wish that beak could stop plunging into my forehead
[02:19:02.000 --> 02:19:09.000]  right as your consciousness leaves you. You're just going to roll out and go, I'm trendy.
[02:19:09.000 --> 02:19:15.000]  The last thing you'll smell is that buzzard stinking feet as it hops around on your chest
[02:19:15.000 --> 02:19:22.000]  and it takes a big dump right on you. The last thing you're going to smell is buzzard crap.
[02:19:22.000 --> 02:19:28.000]  Like that, honey. Good.
[02:19:28.000 --> 02:19:32.000]  Put that on your show, scum.
[02:19:32.000 --> 02:19:36.000]  We'll be back. That's what I'm thinking, so I'm just going to say it.
[02:19:36.000 --> 02:19:42.000]  I didn't need any little riders to put together for me.
[02:19:42.000 --> 02:19:45.000]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, we're going to come back with your phone call straight ahead.

[02:24:49.000 --> 02:24:54.480]  because the term lynching this is how again they're using modern liberalism to
[02:24:54.480 --> 02:24:58.360]  ban words to ban communication and try to control it and when you point out
[02:24:58.360 --> 02:25:01.560]  they're trying to control knowledge comedy central comes out and the media
[02:25:01.560 --> 02:25:05.640]  picks up on the new words they invent and call it mental nationalism that you
[02:25:05.640 --> 02:25:09.280]  have things you believe in and you won't give up your beliefs that doesn't mean
[02:25:09.280 --> 02:25:13.440]  you don't listen to new ideas oh no that's all we do is constantly study we
[02:25:13.440 --> 02:25:17.960]  know what's behind what they're doing we understand their program of attacking
[02:25:17.960 --> 02:25:22.440]  those of us that want to have a country and want to have tax cuts and want a
[02:25:22.440 --> 02:25:27.720]  government that sticks up for us we're not the schmucks we're not the
[02:25:27.720 --> 02:25:33.440]  thumb suckers we're not the people that have been conned and you try to ridicule
[02:25:33.440 --> 02:25:39.320]  people hoping it'll get them back under your pervert viacom umbrella under your
[02:25:39.320 --> 02:25:45.840]  Anthony Weiner umbrella it's not gonna work so just keep it up this is great to
[02:25:45.840 --> 02:25:53.680]  watch you fail Zach Lee DJ Carrie Charles and others are gonna go to your
[02:25:53.680 --> 02:25:59.920]  calls right now let's go to Zach in Florida Zach you're on the air yes
[02:25:59.920 --> 02:26:05.240]  Alex it's great to be on and I just wanted to discuss this how big of a
[02:26:05.240 --> 02:26:10.280]  distraction is NFL issue this is textbook cognitive dissidents literally
[02:26:10.280 --> 02:26:14.360]  days ago we have the North Korean foreign minister on our home soil
[02:26:14.360 --> 02:26:20.040]  threatening us have we learned nothing from 9-11 have we learned nothing they
[02:26:20.040 --> 02:26:23.960]  are they are just completely you know chumming the waters for an attack on our
[02:26:23.960 --> 02:26:28.040]  country and we're almost welcome it this is complete cognitive dissonance and
[02:26:28.040 --> 02:26:30.880]  it's working so effectively this is an issue in a discussion that we have to
[02:26:30.880 --> 02:26:34.640]  have with the NFL but it's all anybody's talking about and I know it's
[02:26:34.640 --> 02:26:38.760]  important but this is textbook because they can't have it both ways either North
[02:26:38.760 --> 02:26:42.600]  Korea's legitimate threat or they're not no I agree but it's it politically it's
[02:26:42.600 --> 02:26:47.280]  breaking political correctness is back for a long time this is cognitively
[02:26:47.280 --> 02:26:51.360]  waking up a lot of people that have been on the sideline here I appreciate
[02:26:51.360 --> 02:26:54.800]  your calls Zach this is a big victory what what Trump's having but yes North
[02:26:54.800 --> 02:26:59.160]  Korea is a serious issue the economy is a serious issue so much is going on but
[02:26:59.160 --> 02:27:07.240]  the NFL they are really really really jump in the shark here USA Day reports in
[02:27:07.240 --> 02:27:11.640]  North Korea millions signed up for military to fight against US well
[02:27:11.640 --> 02:27:15.960]  there's a war it's gonna be nuclear and so that's not gonna matter the North
[02:27:15.960 --> 02:27:18.960]  already tried to bully the South before with the Chinese already tried to take
[02:27:18.960 --> 02:27:22.520]  over and kill everybody and the US stood up against him and MacArthur should
[02:27:22.520 --> 02:27:27.280]  have been allowed in 1953 to stop it he wasn't so 60 plus years later we're
[02:27:27.280 --> 02:27:32.000]  right back where we were that doesn't mean I want war it doesn't mean I want
[02:27:32.000 --> 02:27:36.120]  preemptive strikes it means the communists are bad they did bad things
[02:27:36.120 --> 02:27:40.680]  they started the Korean War the United States defeated Japan let China put
[02:27:40.680 --> 02:27:45.440]  Communists in we didn't start this so the Communists are the aggressors I
[02:27:45.440 --> 02:27:49.840]  understand the United States is over there because we have interest there I
[02:27:49.840 --> 02:27:53.520]  don't want a war but it can't be take the side of North Korea just because we
[02:27:53.520 --> 02:27:57.160]  have problems here I'm not saying the class caller was saying that it's just
[02:27:57.160 --> 02:28:00.520]  that Ron Paul when I was just showing both sides of the debate was like come on
[02:28:00.520 --> 02:28:05.440]  Alex that's neocon rhetoric no Kim Jong-un is evil Kim Jong-un is out of
[02:28:05.440 --> 02:28:09.920]  control it doesn't mean I want a war it means I can say they're evil and
[02:28:09.920 --> 02:28:16.080]  corrupt and bad we have some neocon forces that are bad as well just because
[02:28:16.080 --> 02:28:21.200]  we're bad sometimes doesn't mean North Korea is good DJ in Indiana you're on
[02:28:21.200 --> 02:28:23.840]  the air go ahead

[02:29:45.360 --> 02:29:53.760]  on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network
[02:29:56.360 --> 02:30:00.760]  Stanch antifederalist Patrick Kenry was opposed to the Constitution fearing it
[02:30:00.760 --> 02:30:04.200]  would become a monster that would take over not only the sovereign states that
[02:30:04.200 --> 02:30:08.080]  had created it but that it would become a tool to destroy individual liberty his
[02:30:08.080 --> 02:30:12.680]  warnings ignored have now come to pass he said you're not to inquire how your
[02:30:12.680 --> 02:30:17.240]  trade may be increased nor how you were to become a great and powerful people but
[02:30:17.240 --> 02:30:21.600]  how your liberties can be secured for liberty ought to be the direct end of
[02:30:21.600 --> 02:30:25.160]  your government Patrick Henry warned us the liberties of a people never were
[02:30:25.160 --> 02:30:29.040]  nor ever will be secure when the transactions of their rulers may be
[02:30:29.040 --> 02:30:33.360]  concealed from them today everything the government does at every level is
[02:30:33.360 --> 02:30:37.640]  concealed from us we have trade deals to manage our economy that not even our
[02:30:37.640 --> 02:30:41.280]  elected representatives are allowed to see later in life Patrick Henry looked
[02:30:41.280 --> 02:30:45.320]  back and said when the American spirit was in its youth the language of America
[02:30:45.320 --> 02:30:49.960]  was different liberty sir was the primary object today our primary concern
[02:30:49.960 --> 02:30:55.080]  is safety and comfort when we should be demanding liberty grandfather wars calm

[02:33:57.360 --> 02:34:04.600]  you are funding an operation that literally is beyond a burr under the
[02:34:04.600 --> 02:34:09.600]  saddle of the New World Order we are accurately analyzing the globalist we
[02:34:09.600 --> 02:34:17.000]  are exposing their program in real time and we are really shaking them and we're
[02:34:17.000 --> 02:34:21.840]  a major focal point my main goal is to get the liberty movement going so strong
[02:34:21.840 --> 02:34:26.640]  and anti-globalism so strong that so many other major players arrive that
[02:34:26.640 --> 02:34:30.520]  actually go for the jugular can't be bought off can't be intimidated that I
[02:34:30.520 --> 02:34:35.400]  can recede because we tell you something I don't want to be paddle the metal
[02:34:35.400 --> 02:34:43.440]  RPMs in the red for 20 years there's a selfish side of me I've got a four and
[02:34:43.440 --> 02:34:47.840]  a half month old daughter who is the sweetest thing you ever seen and I
[02:34:47.840 --> 02:34:51.960]  really do want to spend time with her and and look I know the world's going to
[02:34:51.960 --> 02:34:56.040]  a time of great change so I'm not complaining about how much I work but I
[02:34:56.040 --> 02:35:00.720]  mean I'm cross-eyed at the time and there's been a lot of stuff they've done
[02:35:00.720 --> 02:35:07.800]  to me behind the scenes just to where I don't want to continue to do this if I've
[02:35:07.800 --> 02:35:11.400]  got too many irons in the fire and I just can't execute it all properly
[02:35:11.400 --> 02:35:15.760]  because believe me they're sabotaging us like a pack of gremlins imagine it see
[02:35:15.760 --> 02:35:19.200]  the old World War two jokes about gremlins on board an aircraft and you
[02:35:19.200 --> 02:35:23.720]  got 20 little green guys climbing all over the fuselage tearing wires out and
[02:35:23.720 --> 02:35:27.200]  you know trying to sabotage the engines I mean I'm trying to carry out the main
[02:35:27.200 --> 02:35:31.640]  mission and I got gremlins all over the plane but that's okay they know to come
[02:35:31.640 --> 02:35:34.680]  after us probably play that on Comedy Central and say I really believe in
[02:35:34.680 --> 02:35:38.600]  gremlins it's a metaphor they don't care their liars so they'll just take it
[02:35:38.600 --> 02:35:42.200]  play it and that's fine folks will hear it think it's funny come watch the show
[02:35:42.200 --> 02:35:47.600]  come listen to it so we definitely make lemonade out of lemons but vitamin

[02:38:12.920 --> 02:38:18.400]  wants to talk about Roy Moore victory in Alabama despite 33 million dollars
[02:38:18.400 --> 02:38:23.200]  of established money against his 2 million Roy Moore won another sign of
[02:38:23.200 --> 02:38:27.520]  an unstoppable populist wave that will destroy Republicans and Democrats go
[02:38:27.520 --> 02:38:32.480]  ahead well Alex the pleasure to be on the show and honor to speak to you as
[02:38:32.480 --> 02:38:37.400]  always and sabotage is the perfect track to play prior to the commercial break
[02:38:37.400 --> 02:38:42.640]  because GOP is sabotaging themselves I mean they distance themselves from
[02:38:42.640 --> 02:38:47.320]  Trump during the primaries the election and couple months after the election the
[02:38:47.320 --> 02:38:51.320]  fact that they're calling on him to endorse a candidate that should have it
[02:38:51.320 --> 02:38:55.640]  in the bag like Luther has already served proves they're getting desperate and
[02:38:55.640 --> 02:38:59.960]  that they know that the populist movement is coming and the fact that Roy Moore
[02:38:59.960 --> 02:39:04.120]  won and I mean this man pulled a gun on stage he did everything wrong by the
[02:39:04.120 --> 02:39:09.200]  box but I was about to say they think being wild and being real like Kid
[02:39:09.200 --> 02:39:13.000]  Rocker myself or something makes folks hate us it's the opposite all these
[02:39:13.000 --> 02:39:19.200]  stuff suit sociopath sellout mummies don't get it yet but as bright art
[02:39:19.200 --> 02:39:23.560]  reports Roy Moore is Alabama victory deals devastating modem
[02:39:23.560 --> 02:39:27.800]  McConnell establishment and it's not over yet as that moves but the
[02:39:27.800 --> 02:39:32.960]  Republicans made back the Democrat against him that's incredible I mean the
[02:39:32.960 --> 02:39:37.960]  GOP has to be just so nervous right now because Trump may have lost the battle
[02:39:37.960 --> 02:39:44.000]  with endorsing Senator Luther but his movement is won the war this is a sign
[02:39:44.000 --> 02:39:50.040]  of winning the war so the Trump populist movement is stronger than ever I agree
[02:39:50.040 --> 02:39:53.280]  you know and I've never won worn cowboy hats on air and ever ride around on
[02:39:53.280 --> 02:39:56.960]  horses but I've really worked on a ranch and really have a family ranch and a
[02:39:56.960 --> 02:40:01.120]  family farm that's operating I think I'm gonna go out and get on some horses and
[02:40:01.120 --> 02:40:05.000]  ride around and fire fully auto from horseback and stuff just because the
[02:40:05.000 --> 02:40:09.440]  globalist hate it so much I think we need to just throw the Americana back in
[02:40:09.440 --> 02:40:13.680]  their face what do you think oh a hundred percent and I mean they need to
[02:40:13.680 --> 02:40:18.120]  see it from every angle and we let the liberals suppress us so much of this
[02:40:18.120 --> 02:40:21.760]  anti-American rhetoric and we need to stand up and show that this is the least
[02:40:21.760 --> 02:40:27.280]  cool thing possible it is somebody on horseback you know riding around and
[02:40:27.280 --> 02:40:30.720]  somebody out there about mother taking care of her kids a firefighter a factory
[02:40:30.720 --> 02:40:36.080]  worker that's sexy that's Americana that's value ourselves again and isn't it
[02:40:36.080 --> 02:40:40.480]  beautiful to see the rejection of Hollywood the NFL that's the American
[02:40:40.480 --> 02:40:45.560]  spirit Alexander de Tugful the French historian said the true revolution is
[02:40:45.560 --> 02:40:52.920]  people don't like elitism they like real folks and that was the true breaking
[02:40:52.920 --> 02:40:57.920]  of the class system through free market not through communism America sexy it's
[02:40:57.920 --> 02:41:04.360]  new it's the cutting edge it's why everybody wanted to come here God
[02:41:04.360 --> 02:41:08.440]  bless you yeah that's the joke photo of me and Trump and Putin on horseback for
[02:41:08.440 --> 02:41:11.480]  radio listeners Google Alex Jones on horseback you got the planet of the
[02:41:11.480 --> 02:41:15.120]  apes one where I really did ride down the side of the beach in Grand Cayman on
[02:41:15.120 --> 02:41:19.640]  a horse and my girlfriend at the time now my wife took that picture and then
[02:41:19.640 --> 02:41:23.760]  you got the one she did too we were out riding horseback in it in the Texas hill
[02:41:23.760 --> 02:41:27.720]  country it really triggers the leftist for some reason and they go oh look he's
[02:41:27.720 --> 02:41:32.480]  done and make fun of it I wondered why do they make fun of it when somebody gets
[02:41:32.480 --> 02:41:36.040]  a snapshot of me actually wearing a cowboy hat out in the country or I'm on
[02:41:36.040 --> 02:41:39.720]  a horse don't worry cowboy heck is my head doesn't get burned they do it because
[02:41:39.720 --> 02:41:44.880]  they hate it folks because I supposed to be up on that horse or they go oh look
[02:41:44.880 --> 02:41:49.600]  he's a Texan he's wearing tennis shoes they just don't get any of it yeah there
[02:41:49.600 --> 02:41:53.040]  I am in Grand Cayman and then let's pull up the one in Texas Alex Jones on horse
[02:41:53.040 --> 02:41:58.600]  back triggers liberals and they just go completely insane over it and if they
[02:41:58.600 --> 02:42:02.520]  don't like it I'm gonna do it more like that's it I'm doing it I'm gonna ride

[02:42:05.920 --> 02:42:09.480]  though you know I've done this twice before back before it was popular on
[02:42:09.480 --> 02:42:15.360]  TV but I've hunted wild hogs with carbide shotgun Zulu spears on horseback
[02:42:15.360 --> 02:42:20.400]  with pit bulls and I think it's so triggering I think I'm gonna go out
[02:42:20.400 --> 02:42:23.840]  there get my killies fix first or maybe I'll just go out let my killies get blown
[02:42:23.840 --> 02:42:28.160]  I'm gonna go out and kill wild 400 500 pound hogs with a big spear you think
[02:42:28.160 --> 02:42:31.120]  folks would like that I mean I got a bunch of footage of stuff like this I
[02:42:31.120 --> 02:42:35.520]  put out maybe I should just put it out of the triggers on that bad they want to

[02:44:19.640 --> 02:44:25.160]  have a run of that sorry go ahead okay well I wondered one of those but I

[02:44:29.280 --> 02:44:36.200]  that sound all right sounds good before I get to my main point about health care
[02:44:36.200 --> 02:44:42.720]  and destroying the mainstream media you say you're willing to be corrected let
[02:44:42.720 --> 02:44:50.240]  me tell you about something from yesterday it's a myth that the anti
[02:44:50.240 --> 02:44:56.200]  pre-trivers put out that it's only 200 years old actually if you go back to the
[02:44:56.200 --> 02:45:00.040]  ancient church fathers of the first century they all believed in the pre-tribe
[02:45:00.040 --> 02:45:06.000]  rapture dr. Ken Johnson well actually they believe that that that within their
[02:45:06.000 --> 02:45:09.920]  lifetime Christ would come back and that then they thought when the sacking of
[02:45:09.920 --> 02:45:14.720]  Jerusalem came in 70 AD by Titus that that was the end of the world you're
[02:45:14.720 --> 02:45:24.640]  correct all right well anyway that and and I know you've had Steve Quail on
[02:45:24.640 --> 02:45:29.800]  he's a pre-triber as well well buddy let me say this I sure hope listen you
[02:45:29.800 --> 02:45:41.320]  heard me saying I hope that's the case he's still there all right I am an ex
[02:45:41.320 --> 02:45:49.840]  physician I quit in in protest to Obamacare passing but I think and you're
[02:45:49.840 --> 02:45:54.800]  probably too young to remember this but I'm quite a bit older than you I'm
[02:45:54.800 --> 02:46:03.720]  seven I remember when every other commercial on TV was about camels or
[02:46:03.720 --> 02:46:10.640]  the Marlboro man and they finally deleted those if they delete the drug
[02:46:10.640 --> 02:46:16.080]  industry from being able to advertise on TV and go back to the days when you had
[02:46:16.080 --> 02:46:21.760]  reps that came into your office like I did and gave you samples which they
[02:46:21.760 --> 02:46:26.440]  hardly ever give out anymore because they're spending too damn much money on
[02:46:26.440 --> 02:46:31.400]  TV advertising I used to use those samples for people that couldn't afford
[02:46:31.400 --> 02:46:37.360]  their drugs I was about to say they used to give you samples so you could test it
[02:46:37.360 --> 02:46:40.720]  on the patients I've already approved stuff to see what worked best for you
[02:46:40.720 --> 02:46:44.920]  because you were the physician you were in charge you were doing your practice
[02:46:44.920 --> 02:46:49.160]  to practice and see what worked best and said they've removed that from you and
[02:46:49.160 --> 02:46:53.280]  basically made you somebody that just the computers tell what to do so they're
[02:46:53.280 --> 02:46:57.960]  really ending the Hippocratic oath about 16 years ago as I'm sure you know as a
[02:46:57.960 --> 02:47:02.320]  retired physician you're absolutely right and and so weren't you not taught in
[02:47:02.320 --> 02:47:06.040]  medical school that a large part of what you did was supposed to be free to the
[02:47:06.040 --> 02:47:11.800]  poor and now they just remove that option from you absolutely and I never
[02:47:11.800 --> 02:47:21.040]  charged clergy or fellow physicians or nuns and and besides all the free care
[02:47:21.040 --> 02:47:25.720]  one day when I was retired I sat and figured out I lost somewhere between
[02:47:25.720 --> 02:47:30.960]  three and four million dollars from people not paying their co-pays and
[02:47:30.960 --> 02:47:35.480]  stuff I got screwed out of from Medicaid and Medicare well my dad's the same way
[02:47:35.480 --> 02:47:39.520]  and he was doing that to serve people in health care and then it when he got
[02:47:39.520 --> 02:47:42.640]  with Obamacare he said we can't legally run anything anymore they've made it
[02:47:42.640 --> 02:47:46.720]  illegal he wasn't going to go join the lobbyist to go by congressman so he had
[02:47:46.720 --> 02:47:51.120]  to get out of it I mean that's where this country is some of the proudest
[02:47:51.120 --> 02:48:00.720]  surgeries I did were free and but beside that I think if you got rid of that it
[02:48:00.720 --> 02:48:08.440]  would kind of take away a lot of the sponsors from the mainstream media which
[02:48:08.440 --> 02:48:15.200]  seems to have a drug commercial on every other commercial and it would it would
[02:48:15.200 --> 02:48:22.320]  also lower the cost of of medicine and health care absolutely God bless you
[02:48:22.320 --> 02:48:26.760]  sir appreciate your calls Lee appreciate all your great testimony and again I'm
[02:48:26.760 --> 02:48:31.920]  not debating pre or post tribulation I'm not getting in the middle of it we know
[02:48:31.920 --> 02:48:36.160]  there's a world government we know it's satanic I mean it says it's satanic and
[02:48:36.160 --> 02:48:40.320]  so they make their jokes all day about it we all understand that we all love
[02:48:40.320 --> 02:48:44.440]  Christ and that's what matters we're brothers and sisters in Christ and I
[02:48:44.440 --> 02:48:48.360]  don't want to see everybody fighting with each other over doctrinal debates you
[02:48:48.360 --> 02:48:52.320]  know Christ is there you accept him as your savior the devil's real evil's real
[02:48:52.320 --> 02:48:56.880]  God's real world government's real the mark of the beast is real let's just know
[02:48:56.880 --> 02:49:00.560]  that's what we're facing because I really think that you know the fighting over
[02:49:00.560 --> 02:49:05.000]  the scripture is what's divided the church up and it's fine to be different
[02:49:05.000 --> 02:49:09.320]  denominations that's all great I just know I love God and I know that I want
[02:49:09.320 --> 02:49:13.160]  to fight the New World Order let's go ahead and go to Charles in Germany you're
[02:49:13.160 --> 02:49:20.280]  on the air thanks for holding Charles hello yes sir go ahead
[02:49:20.280 --> 02:49:26.640]  hey so the first talking point I'd like to make is the teleprompter talking
[02:49:26.640 --> 02:49:30.680]  point by Morgan Freeman that Paul Joseph Watson and the Info Wars crew
[02:49:30.680 --> 02:49:37.680]  destroyed about a week ago that we are at war with Russia this is apparently
[02:49:37.680 --> 02:49:43.000]  big news to me I'm living in the US military community overseas and have
[02:49:43.000 --> 02:49:48.480]  done for about 15 years of my life and over those 15 years it has not been
[02:49:48.480 --> 02:49:54.920]  uncommon at all to see and talk to Russian military soldiers they use our
[02:49:54.920 --> 02:50:02.200]  facilities like the commissary like the PX you know they are our colleagues in
[02:50:02.200 --> 02:50:08.040]  many respects you know they're not we're not a war with these people no well
[02:50:08.040 --> 02:50:11.240]  they're Christians and have pulled out of the New World Order they're fighting
[02:50:11.240 --> 02:50:14.960]  the globalists the communist and that's why they're the enemy now the liberals
[02:50:14.960 --> 02:50:17.440]  wanted to merge with Russian when they were the Soviets they were the one
[02:50:17.440 --> 02:50:20.840]  always giving our plans they were the ones that helped because it was a
[02:50:20.840 --> 02:50:25.680]  godless satanic communist government over the Russian Christians and they
[02:50:25.680 --> 02:50:29.800]  want the same thing here that's all it is that's why they say there's Russian
[02:50:29.800 --> 02:50:34.200]  collusion because there is their spiritual collusion between American and
[02:50:34.200 --> 02:50:38.520]  Russian Christians that's what the pedophile Hollywood Satanists can't
[02:50:38.520 --> 02:50:47.360]  stand exactly and over the course of the past decade with the Islamification of
[02:50:47.360 --> 02:50:53.600]  Europe we have actually seen increases in attacks of Americans overseas one
[02:50:53.600 --> 02:51:00.240]  example I'd like to give to you is the very sad example of first of airmen
[02:51:00.240 --> 02:51:07.360]  first class Zachary Cuttaback back in 2011 he was a bus driver
[02:51:07.360 --> 02:51:17.080]  busing to Frankfurt Airport to pick up members of the 48 security forces and
[02:51:17.080 --> 02:51:26.080]  upon picking them up was killed by an Albanian ethnic along with another
[02:51:26.080 --> 02:51:30.840]  member of that security force sure just like just like the attack that this
[02:51:30.840 --> 02:51:36.560]  weekend at the church with the Sudanese Muslim immigrant invader you know
[02:51:36.560 --> 02:51:40.040]  shooting nine people killing one and he said I killed him because they were
[02:51:40.040 --> 02:51:43.240]  white and they were Christian and this is the invasion so what do you think
[02:51:43.240 --> 02:51:47.840]  this massive invasion of Europe in the US by military age men is about the left
[02:51:47.840 --> 02:51:52.920]  admits that this is their strong arm I think the left doesn't know when to stop
[02:51:52.920 --> 02:51:58.000]  because we're gonna end up you know going after all these people well Ronald
[02:51:58.000 --> 02:52:03.680]  Reagan very wisely said that if communism ever comes the United States or
[02:52:03.680 --> 02:52:10.920]  Western civilization it'll come under the banner of liberalism so this is from
[02:52:10.920 --> 02:52:16.000]  what I can tell probably a an attack on Western civilization that's it you
[02:52:16.000 --> 02:52:18.920]  always want to know what the communist George Soros attack would look like
[02:52:18.920 --> 02:52:24.240]  this is it and he runs it it's not like it's our opinion we're seeing the full
[02:52:24.240 --> 02:52:31.640]  attack the NFL thing all of it is just the flags evil America's evil let's burn
[02:52:31.640 --> 02:52:35.600]  stuff down let's kill whitey and all these white coaches and all these weird
[02:52:35.600 --> 02:52:39.120]  white doctors though and whites are evil whites are bad their virtues
[02:52:39.120 --> 02:52:43.120]  signaling in what they're trying to start don't kill us well guess what the
[02:52:43.120 --> 02:52:46.520]  minorities of the majority they want free market they want America they're not
[02:52:46.520 --> 02:52:53.440]  stupid they're running a big dry run that's a failure this thing is dead on
[02:52:53.440 --> 02:52:56.840]  arrival they were supposed to have Hillary in while they executed all this
[02:52:56.840 --> 02:53:01.760]  they're following a whole plan it's a misfire it's a derailment it's a jack
[02:53:01.760 --> 02:53:10.600]  knife it's a caddy wampus it's over Charles God bless you let's now go to
[02:53:10.600 --> 02:53:15.320]  Kerry in Missouri once talk about that fellow Tatum I had a piece of paper here
[02:53:15.320 --> 02:53:19.040]  what's that guy's first name I love him Brandon Tatum my new favorite talk show
[02:53:19.040 --> 02:53:23.480]  host comes out of nowhere it's 90,000 followers of he only had a few thousand
[02:53:23.480 --> 02:53:28.640]  before because talking politics he's a true natural just absolutely devastating
[02:53:28.640 --> 02:53:33.840]  them right down the line what do you make a Brandon Tatum the officer Tatum
[02:53:34.280 --> 02:53:39.520]  what do you make Kerry in Missouri oh sir I'm not familiar with that Alex it's
[02:53:39.520 --> 02:53:42.160]  just a pleasure okay well just said Tatum maybe you didn't know the guy's
[02:53:42.160 --> 02:53:45.720]  name it just said on screen Kerry in Missouri wants to talk Tatum you mean
[02:53:45.720 --> 02:53:52.800]  the guy we played earlier oh yeah I'm sorry yeah those guys were right on and
[02:53:52.800 --> 02:53:57.320]  when he talked about that you know once you get a year you're not a factual if
[02:53:57.320 --> 02:54:02.040]  you're an NFL NBA you're injured you know what's up what are you gonna do yeah
[02:54:02.040 --> 02:54:06.360]  you retire fat big bank account but you're no longer legitimate your voice
[02:54:06.360 --> 02:54:10.800]  doesn't mean nothing so I totally agree with that I mean more power to him I
[02:54:10.800 --> 02:54:15.880]  just I really wanted to get on I've listened to you for years followers
[02:54:15.880 --> 02:54:20.760]  supporter in every way have info wars and Trump stickers on my truck thank you
[02:54:20.760 --> 02:54:27.200]  some excitement sometimes let's just say that which is interesting well you're
[02:54:27.200 --> 02:54:31.080]  extra dot you're exercising your first amendment the face of bullies and that's
[02:54:31.080 --> 02:54:35.240]  literally serving your country to have an info war sticker not the extent of the
[02:54:35.240 --> 02:54:38.680]  military whatever but it's a war zone out there they attack folks whatever I
[02:54:38.680 --> 02:54:41.520]  mean you're in a you're in a zone with anti-fine the rest of them they're
[02:54:41.520 --> 02:54:46.320]  killing cops so when you basically stick an info wars com sticker or a Trump
[02:54:46.320 --> 02:54:50.160]  sticker on your car it's like putting on a police uniform basically because the
[02:54:50.160 --> 02:54:54.520]  anti-fine BLM they want to go after patriots Trump supporters info war
[02:54:54.520 --> 02:54:59.760]  supporters and police so yeah I mean it is supporting the first amendment in a
[02:54:59.760 --> 02:55:03.600]  civil war up against a bunch of terrorists so it's so it really is
[02:55:03.600 --> 02:55:09.040]  serving your country sorry Alex go ahead no no you go ahead well I'm just saying
[02:55:09.040 --> 02:55:13.920]  that we live in Missouri in the central Ozarks if you will and then kind of a
[02:55:13.920 --> 02:55:21.840]  rural area but you would be amazed at the Muslim infiltration is what I call it
[02:55:21.840 --> 02:55:28.280]  here we live close to Missouri S&T and which it's just crazy it's crazy when
[02:55:28.280 --> 02:55:32.920]  you go into Walmart you're just stared down the Walmart Supercenter over there
[02:55:32.920 --> 02:55:37.160]  it's just crazy but yeah we get a lot from just what you would think would be
[02:55:37.160 --> 02:55:40.760]  normal what you do with that Trump sticker on there you know an info wars
[02:55:40.760 --> 02:55:45.400]  you know and usually you can just you know walk away from it but sometimes
[02:55:45.400 --> 02:55:49.520]  stand your ground you have to you know we're not just gonna live on our knees
[02:55:49.520 --> 02:55:54.720]  and I think mainly I tried yesterday was the first time I've ever tried to talk
[02:55:54.720 --> 02:55:58.720]  I want to jump in there on about the Ron Paul I listened to that the other day
[02:55:58.720 --> 02:56:03.000]  and I'm like what the heck is this guy even talking about and I remember why at
[02:56:03.000 --> 02:56:07.640]  first I kind of supported Ron Paul years ago and then when he started going well
[02:56:07.640 --> 02:56:13.600]  what's wrong with Iran having a nuke hello you know what's he smoking so and I
[02:56:13.600 --> 02:56:17.400]  keep hearing you go with different people and you're like you know he was
[02:56:17.400 --> 02:56:21.360]  kind of like don't say that Alex don't well he's the one that I wouldn't have
[02:56:21.360 --> 02:56:24.640]  him back on my show just to be honest with your brother I love Ron Paul he's
[02:56:24.640 --> 02:56:30.160]  done a lot the issue is oh Alex they claim they've got nukes no North Korea
[02:56:30.160 --> 02:56:33.640]  has nukes they're they're the ones threatening to blow up Japan and the
[02:56:33.640 --> 02:56:37.520]  US so I get the fact that we don't want to have more wars and that we've had
[02:56:37.520 --> 02:56:43.200]  but the fact is Kim Jong-un is bad I mean let's admit communism really sucks
[02:56:43.200 --> 02:56:49.720]  yeah exactly I mean it just seems like a different parallel to me that and like
[02:56:49.720 --> 02:56:53.080]  I said I actually well here's a bellwether Joel Scousins not supported
[02:56:53.080 --> 02:56:57.200]  any of these wars but as he's pointed out North Korea is real it's being back
[02:56:57.200 --> 02:57:01.160]  by the Chinese and they're planning something big and so we better get ready
[02:57:01.160 --> 02:57:05.000]  to understand this is serious and that mean we want a war either but folks
[02:57:05.000 --> 02:57:08.160]  better know this is the real deal
[02:57:08.280 --> 02:57:13.640]  go ahead you know which is a red flag or whatever you want to call it you know
[02:57:13.640 --> 02:57:19.320]  we all better be hanging on our guns and our Bibles you know and I did want to
[02:57:19.320 --> 02:57:23.800]  talk real quick and Thessalonians Paul said who remember now he helped
[02:57:23.800 --> 02:57:28.080]  Stevens Cove while he was being stoned to death and then it became he wrote two
[02:57:28.080 --> 02:57:32.680]  thirds the New Testament he said let no man deceive you that day of the Lord the
[02:57:32.680 --> 02:57:37.080]  coming of the Lord will not happen till the first there's a great falling away
[02:57:37.080 --> 02:57:41.880]  of the church okay of the so-called Christians well how's that happen because
[02:57:41.880 --> 02:57:46.240]  they're threatened with Islam and because the rapture did not happen when it was
[02:57:46.240 --> 02:57:50.160]  supposed to happen so there's a great falling away until that son of
[02:57:50.160 --> 02:57:56.200]  perdition that wicked is revealed the beast the mark the man you know the one
[02:57:56.200 --> 02:58:00.880]  world ruler anyway more than anything I just want to encourage you I know you're

[03:00:22.840 --> 03:00:27.640]  american flags perfect for any of this back when I'd use the flag to push
[03:00:27.640 --> 03:00:30.800]  folks getting behind wars I knew were frauds I'd get mad about it but it's
[03:00:30.800 --> 03:00:34.800]  not the flags fault you got to weigh america for its overall history when it
[03:00:34.800 --> 03:00:38.160]  stands for and realize you're part of it and if you're not gonna go join
[03:00:38.160 --> 03:00:42.200]  something else then why sit here and bitch about it doesn't mean you can't be
[03:00:42.200 --> 03:00:45.780]  here and hate america that's your right I have a right to say you don't like to
[03:00:45.780 --> 03:00:50.120]  get the hell out and all these evil forces want to bring down america for
[03:00:50.120 --> 03:00:54.280]  a reason they want to control it so that's why I'm with america and then
[03:00:54.280 --> 03:00:57.920]  I'm gonna be with something I'm gonna be a hundred and ten percent that means
[03:00:57.920 --> 03:01:01.280]  when Trump does stuff that didn't write I'm gonna criticize it hard to get him
[03:01:01.280 --> 03:01:07.240]  back in line but I still know he's got a good heart now he's behind judge more
[03:01:07.240 --> 03:01:13.320]  and say that's who he should have gone with he got told by republicans you get
[03:01:13.320 --> 03:01:17.720]  on board with us we'll help you get the tax cuts and get rid of obama care they
[03:01:17.720 --> 03:01:23.760]  screwed him over well now he realizes it and that's what this is about but
[03:01:23.760 --> 03:01:28.040]  america gets it a lot of people ask me why aren't you covering Puerto Rico I've
[03:01:28.040 --> 03:01:31.160]  been covering Puerto Rico since this tournament we've had reporters on from
[03:01:31.160 --> 03:01:34.960]  Puerto Rico we ought to have some of the reporters on again it's bad the power
[03:01:34.960 --> 03:01:38.440]  still out it's very serious and trump said in the military there and all the
[03:01:38.440 --> 03:01:42.520]  rest of it we only got so much military we're running out here with Texas and
[03:01:42.520 --> 03:01:46.160]  Florida everywhere else I mean Florida's gigantic you know the area that was
[03:01:46.160 --> 03:01:50.960]  heads we pray for Puerto Rico send them support whatever the issue is it's just
[03:01:50.960 --> 03:01:56.320]  so big like Mexico I mean just Mexico is gonna send us help now they can't I
[03:01:56.320 --> 03:02:01.440]  don't blame him they got hit by mega quakes the hurricanes I mean you name it
[03:02:01.440 --> 03:02:10.160]  but I do know that culturally people are rejecting this NFL garbage because
[03:02:10.160 --> 03:02:13.920]  they see what it is and it shows Hollywood doubling down the force feeding
[03:02:13.920 --> 03:02:19.120]  of all this race war garbage has not worked and the more they push it now the
[03:02:19.120 --> 03:02:24.280]  better it gets for everybody because people aren't blaming black folks for
[03:02:24.280 --> 03:02:29.320]  all this they see right through it they know it's a democratic party and and
[03:02:29.320 --> 03:02:33.520]  despite all the King's horses and all the King's men all the co-bears and all
[03:02:33.520 --> 03:02:38.600]  of them together trying to say this is racist what Trump did everybody sees
[03:02:38.600 --> 03:02:44.480]  through it so the fact that we're holding fast in the face of this bullying
[03:02:44.480 --> 03:02:49.480]  is making us stronger by the minute now I do worry about what they're gonna pull
[03:02:49.480 --> 03:02:52.960]  next cuz let me tell you they're pissed and they're desperate they're flailing
[03:02:52.960 --> 03:02:58.160]  around their corner so who knows who's been holding the longest here let me see
[03:02:58.160 --> 03:03:01.680]  that'd be Jay in Massachusetts Jay thanks for holding the day on this
[03:03:01.680 --> 03:03:07.120]  Thursday edition here on the air worldwide hey Alex how's it going good
[03:03:07.120 --> 03:03:11.840]  brother thanks for calling so yeah I had a couple points that the previous
[03:03:11.840 --> 03:03:16.880]  color that called in talk about Ron Paul during the conversation and I should
[03:03:16.880 --> 03:03:21.160]  tell her it's kind of funny he called you and he'll call a couple times for
[03:03:21.160 --> 03:03:26.600]  counting the Republican line you kind of changed before from going to
[03:03:26.600 --> 03:03:31.520]  anti-war and the globalist are starting to try to topple regimes and then the
[03:03:31.520 --> 03:03:35.540]  whole PNAC document all that stuff and seems like you kind of change your
[03:03:35.540 --> 03:03:40.280]  tune since then because we've got a new president in and we're fighting the
[03:03:40.280 --> 03:03:44.000]  globalist and the globalist put help North Korea they gave them weapons they've
[03:03:44.000 --> 03:03:48.440]  been using it to to take control the region as a set piece and let China be
[03:03:48.440 --> 03:03:54.320]  dominant and Trump standing up against that and so Korea Kim Jong-un is
[03:03:54.320 --> 03:03:57.560]  shooting missiles over Japan threatening to nuke the US so I'm saying we
[03:03:57.560 --> 03:04:01.760]  have to have a strong response we're in a different world another timeframe does
[03:04:01.760 --> 03:04:06.520]  that make sense yeah but at the same time you know for him to actually launch
[03:04:06.520 --> 03:04:10.320]  those missiles part of the agreement is that he notifies the US in advance so
[03:04:10.320 --> 03:04:15.080]  we actually know our government knows in advance of those launches so when we
[03:04:15.080 --> 03:04:18.560]  when we see the news and when you propagate this thing where it's like
[03:04:18.560 --> 03:04:22.080]  he's just doing this out of nowhere like he actually has the file for those to
[03:04:22.080 --> 03:04:27.880]  be made aware in Japan United States like our government I know and now he's
[03:04:27.880 --> 03:04:31.160]  signaled that he's gonna do an above-ground hydrogen bomb test you like
[03:04:31.160 --> 03:04:36.040]  that yeah well no at the same time so when when you say that he's doing these
[03:04:36.040 --> 03:04:39.640]  things hold on Jay Jay I'm gonna come back to you and Laura Loomer is just

[03:04:55.560 --> 03:04:59.720]  profoundly once said many years ago that if fascism ever comes to America it'll

[03:08:24.160 --> 03:08:48.020]  Alex Jones
[03:08:54.160 --> 03:08:59.120]  Okay, we got Roger Stone here with us, and I'll be gone in about 10-15 minutes, but
[03:08:59.120 --> 03:09:01.600]  I promise to take a lot of calls so we're co-hosting together.
[03:09:01.600 --> 03:09:04.080]  He's got a lot of big breaking news on multiple fronts.
[03:09:04.080 --> 03:09:07.960]  Laura Loomer has confronted Uma Abadine again.
[03:09:07.960 --> 03:09:08.960]  That brings up the subject.
[03:09:08.960 --> 03:09:14.280]  The New York Times has written articles where they say they admire Anthony Weiner.
[03:09:14.280 --> 03:09:20.600]  I mean, this is bizarre garbage, but Jay in Massachusetts, I want to fill Roger Stone
[03:09:20.600 --> 03:09:21.600]  in here.
[03:09:21.600 --> 03:09:25.560]  I like Ron Paul, I appreciate Ron Paul.
[03:09:25.560 --> 03:09:31.520]  Ron Paul has said on air that half the contributions he got in one of his presidential runs were
[03:09:31.520 --> 03:09:35.360]  from M4Wars supporters, and that close to half in the next run.
[03:09:35.360 --> 03:09:42.400]  So let's be clear, I'm not bragging, I'm telling my audience, you were the biggest
[03:09:42.400 --> 03:09:48.080]  group that supported Ron Paul, who helped build the modern liberty movement.
[03:09:48.080 --> 03:09:53.600]  When I supported Senator Ron Paul to run for the Senate, and was his biggest supporter
[03:09:53.600 --> 03:09:58.560]  and he said on air that early on, most of his support was from us in Kentucky.
[03:09:58.560 --> 03:10:03.120]  He only comes on when he calls in one song, because his staff thinks it's Alex Jones,
[03:10:03.120 --> 03:10:04.800]  and oh my gosh, he has to call.
[03:10:04.800 --> 03:10:06.640]  When he comes on, he calls us.
[03:10:06.640 --> 03:10:07.640]  I don't even care.
[03:10:07.640 --> 03:10:11.040]  It's a U.S. senator, I like him for his policies.
[03:10:11.040 --> 03:10:14.320]  Our listeners would rather us play some YouTube video of an average person.
[03:10:14.320 --> 03:10:17.960]  You understand, like, Ron Paul's lucky to come on this show.
[03:10:17.960 --> 03:10:18.960]  They all are.
[03:10:18.960 --> 03:10:21.760]  And I'm not knocking them, but folks are sick of senators.
[03:10:21.760 --> 03:10:23.760]  They're sick of congressmen.
[03:10:23.760 --> 03:10:25.440]  They're sick of presidents.
[03:10:25.440 --> 03:10:27.440]  What they want is results.
[03:10:27.440 --> 03:10:34.520]  Now, I've said, Ron Paul's on here, he's a good guy, and he's like, Alex, you sound
[03:10:34.520 --> 03:10:38.960]  like a neocon, you sound like a warmonger, saying North Korea's a threat, and oh, stop
[03:10:38.960 --> 03:10:43.480]  saying they got a bomb, and stop saying they're threatening, that's neocon propaganda.
[03:10:43.480 --> 03:10:46.440]  And I'm like, listen, I'm just putting out the other side, because this is North Korea,
[03:10:46.440 --> 03:10:47.440]  this is a really bad guy.
[03:10:47.440 --> 03:10:49.640]  This is a serious oppressor.
[03:10:49.640 --> 03:10:51.040]  I was against the Iraq war.
[03:10:51.040 --> 03:10:52.240]  I was against the Syria war.
[03:10:52.240 --> 03:10:53.240]  I've been against the Libya war.
[03:10:53.240 --> 03:10:58.080]  I've been against it all, having the CIA experts on, exposing it all, literally getting the
[03:10:58.080 --> 03:11:03.920]  attack because I'm doing it, trying to stop the Arab Spring.
[03:11:03.920 --> 03:11:10.600]  But then to just say, you're a neocon, because I'm like, listen, I get, we've got neocons,
[03:11:10.600 --> 03:11:14.720]  we got warmongers, blah, blah, blah, but North Korea, I don't want war, but they've
[03:11:14.720 --> 03:11:20.760]  got a role to play, they're doing some bad stuff, and there's this thought thing politically
[03:11:20.760 --> 03:11:24.480]  where no, they're not.
[03:11:24.480 --> 03:11:28.960]  And then callers call in and say, I don't want to hear Ron Paul on again, or Jay calls
[03:11:28.960 --> 03:11:32.160]  in and starts going, Alex, you are changing your views on things.
[03:11:32.160 --> 03:11:33.480]  No, I'm not.
[03:11:33.480 --> 03:11:38.160]  Why is everything so polarized?
[03:11:38.160 --> 03:11:42.440]  I support this country, and I support our military, and Trump is defeating ISIS and
[03:11:42.440 --> 03:11:46.800]  not going in like his generals want, and kicking out Damascus and getting rid of Assad, and
[03:11:46.800 --> 03:11:48.440]  Assad is promising to have elections.
[03:11:48.440 --> 03:11:49.960]  That's what Trump said he'd do.
[03:11:49.960 --> 03:11:50.960]  It's what he's doing.
[03:11:50.960 --> 03:11:53.160]  He's doing what he said on the tax cuts.
[03:11:53.160 --> 03:11:58.560]  But North Korea and China, man, they attacked in 1949, Mao Zedong did.
[03:11:58.560 --> 03:12:03.960]  They came in with Kim Jong-il's father and Kim Jong-un's grandfather, Kim Il-sung.
[03:12:03.960 --> 03:12:09.520]  People don't even know these names, I do, I study it, read books on it, I had family
[03:12:09.520 --> 03:12:11.320]  that was there.
[03:12:11.320 --> 03:12:13.840]  North Korea is a horrible, horrible demon cult.
[03:12:13.840 --> 03:12:16.680]  I get our sanctions hurt them worse.
[03:12:16.680 --> 03:12:18.920]  I don't know what to do.
[03:12:18.920 --> 03:12:22.160]  But people keep acting like, the North's not going to do something, the more you appease
[03:12:22.160 --> 03:12:24.520]  them, the more out of control they get.
[03:12:24.520 --> 03:12:28.920]  So this idea that I'm suddenly this big war monger, former Marine Corps officer, I'm going
[03:12:28.920 --> 03:12:33.280]  to go on our guest right now, former Marine Corps officer, you know, he's been against
[03:12:33.280 --> 03:12:37.920]  all these wars, Joel Scousen says, no, this is different, this is real.
[03:12:37.920 --> 03:12:39.400]  And that's because he's really looked at the evidence.
[03:12:39.400 --> 03:12:42.760]  It doesn't mean we want a war, it doesn't mean we don't know we have neocons and war
[03:12:42.760 --> 03:12:43.760]  mongers.
[03:12:43.760 --> 03:12:44.760]  I don't want a war.
[03:12:44.760 --> 03:12:47.200]  It could trigger Russia and China and have a thermal nuclear war.
[03:12:47.200 --> 03:12:48.760]  I want peace.
[03:12:48.760 --> 03:12:55.440]  But I can say North Korea is doing bad stuff, that's not war propaganda, that's the truth.
[03:12:55.440 --> 03:12:59.000]  So I don't get people that can't hold two ideas in their mind at the same time.
[03:12:59.000 --> 03:13:04.080]  And yet we've got our problems, but man, North Korea's, its leaderships really sucks.
[03:13:04.080 --> 03:13:06.840]  Do you get where I'm going with this, Roger Stone?
[03:13:06.840 --> 03:13:07.840]  Yes, indeed.
[03:13:07.840 --> 03:13:08.840]  I most certainly am.
[03:13:08.840 --> 03:13:13.920]  Look, I understand that President Trump is forced to deal with the hangover, the loose
[03:13:13.920 --> 03:13:21.440]  ends from 40 years of adventurous neocon policies, which unfortunately have created
[03:13:21.440 --> 03:13:25.520]  a large number of people in the world who hate our guts.
[03:13:25.520 --> 03:13:27.280]  And unfortunately, that has to be dealt with.
[03:13:27.280 --> 03:13:28.600]  It's a dangerous world.
[03:13:28.600 --> 03:13:35.720]  Now I voted for Ron Paul, I cast my last ballot as a Republican before I switched to the libertarian
[03:13:35.720 --> 03:13:40.080]  party, largely because I'd given up on the Republicans after the capture of the party
[03:13:40.080 --> 03:13:41.640]  by Mitt Romney.
[03:13:41.640 --> 03:13:46.320]  Now that Donald Trump staged the hostile takeover of the Republican Party, I'm back to the
[03:13:46.320 --> 03:13:52.360]  party of my ancestors and the party I'm most sentimentally comfortable in.
[03:13:52.360 --> 03:13:57.480]  But there's no question that you have to be realistic about the North Korean threat.
[03:13:57.480 --> 03:14:00.600]  I'm not for thermal nuclear war over North Korea.
[03:14:00.600 --> 03:14:04.920]  It's hard for me to believe that we couldn't drop some special ops guys in there and take
[03:14:04.920 --> 03:14:05.920]  this guy out.
[03:14:05.920 --> 03:14:06.920]  He's insane.
[03:14:06.920 --> 03:14:09.280]  And his own people know he's insane.
[03:14:09.280 --> 03:14:13.000]  But they're also afraid that they might get shot in the head if they look at him the
[03:14:13.000 --> 03:14:14.000]  wrong way.
[03:14:14.000 --> 03:14:16.240]  He's already killed a bunch of his family.
[03:14:16.240 --> 03:14:18.200]  I mean, he's a bad guy.
[03:14:18.200 --> 03:14:21.680]  We're not saying we want to have a war, but I can say he's a bad guy.
[03:14:21.680 --> 03:14:27.400]  Well, it's like those who say, you know, well, you know, we shouldn't be at war with ISIS.
[03:14:27.400 --> 03:14:31.920]  There's a difference between boots on the ground and deep incursions and using all of
[03:14:31.920 --> 03:14:37.880]  this very expensive technology that we've paid for with our tax dollars and a drone
[03:14:37.880 --> 03:14:39.380]  program.
[03:14:39.380 --> 03:14:43.840]  You know, I do think that there are you have to recognize that George Bush and Hillary
[03:14:43.840 --> 03:14:48.360]  Clinton and Barack Obama left us an existential ISIS threat.
[03:14:48.360 --> 03:14:52.480]  It has to be dealt with in the most limited but effective way possible.
[03:14:52.480 --> 03:14:57.160]  Trump has vowed to crush ISIS and I believe he will.
[03:14:57.160 --> 03:15:01.640]  And I support him getting rid of the project of the globalist and the EU and the rest of
[03:15:01.640 --> 03:15:02.640]  it.
[03:15:02.640 --> 03:15:03.640]  The whole Arab Spring.
[03:15:03.640 --> 03:15:06.480]  Thank God he's stopping that whole program meant to collapse the Middle East and roll
[03:15:06.480 --> 03:15:11.180]  them into Europe and the rest of the world for an Islamic invasion that they could then
[03:15:11.180 --> 03:15:12.180]  use to take our liberties.
[03:15:12.180 --> 03:15:13.680]  I think he's doing a great job.
[03:15:13.680 --> 03:15:14.680]  Jay, there's your response.
[03:15:14.680 --> 03:15:17.280]  I agree with what Roger Stone just said.
[03:15:17.280 --> 03:15:23.920]  And that actually brings up a good point because he said, I mean, you basically said the Senate
[03:15:23.920 --> 03:15:29.080]  Special Forces, which is basically what happened since the 50s, since JFK, which I mean, if
[03:15:29.080 --> 03:15:33.920]  you're saying that you're not a neocon and you're not having that agenda, you basically
[03:15:33.920 --> 03:15:38.560]  just agreed with a fascination of a leader.
[03:15:38.560 --> 03:15:44.040]  So a second point that I want to bring up is the relation from the occult.
[03:15:44.040 --> 03:15:46.960]  That was Roger saying that, but I want to say this.
[03:15:46.960 --> 03:15:50.280]  I don't like regime change and I say don't even go to Venezuela.
[03:15:50.280 --> 03:15:51.440]  That's their problem.
[03:15:51.440 --> 03:15:57.320]  But I'm not going to cry if Kim Jong-un, that little demonic twerk ends up breaking his
[03:15:57.320 --> 03:15:58.320]  neck.
[03:15:58.320 --> 03:16:05.720]  And the alternative, of course, is some military action, some aerial action in which millions
[03:16:05.720 --> 03:16:06.720]  could die theoretically.
[03:16:06.720 --> 03:16:08.680]  Well, let me just say this.
[03:16:08.680 --> 03:16:13.760]  Nobody that wants to just say we're neocons because it's fun to say and then the mighty
[03:16:13.760 --> 03:16:17.560]  have fallen and all the rest of it, explain to me what we're supposed to do about North
[03:16:17.560 --> 03:16:20.160]  Korea because he's firing missiles over Japan.
[03:16:20.160 --> 03:16:22.800]  He's saying imminent attacks on the mainland.
[03:16:22.800 --> 03:16:24.400]  He's going to test hydrogen bombs.
[03:16:24.400 --> 03:16:26.120]  He's threatening to blow up South Korea.
[03:16:26.120 --> 03:16:30.360]  I mean, he's got a gun pointed at us saying he's going to use it.
[03:16:30.360 --> 03:16:32.360]  And of course, you're going to say, well, that's not what he's really saying.
[03:16:32.360 --> 03:16:34.800]  Now, I've gone and read what they're actually saying.
[03:16:34.800 --> 03:16:40.840]  So I think what needs to actually happen is people need to be aware of and made aware
[03:16:40.840 --> 03:16:43.400]  of what the occult agenda actually is.
[03:16:43.400 --> 03:16:47.760]  And so I've actually been to Bohemian gross, you know, you know, as you come into Monterey
[03:16:47.760 --> 03:16:49.800]  and you pass by, you can't meet her.
[03:16:49.800 --> 03:16:55.240]  And there's the little weird looking trucks and all those junkyard looking things as you
[03:16:55.240 --> 03:16:58.560]  come into the Bohemian entrance.
[03:16:58.560 --> 03:16:59.680]  I've actually been in there.
[03:16:59.680 --> 03:17:02.600]  So I know, I know what the surrounding area looks like.
[03:17:02.600 --> 03:17:08.560]  And for you to actually even get into that campground, I mean, that kind of smells a little
[03:17:08.560 --> 03:17:09.560]  fishy.
[03:17:09.560 --> 03:17:11.560]  So are you a traveling man?
[03:17:11.560 --> 03:17:12.560]  A traveling man.
[03:17:12.560 --> 03:17:14.680]  I don't know what that code word means.
[03:17:14.680 --> 03:17:17.320]  Oh, you know what the code word though, right?
[03:17:17.320 --> 03:17:19.040]  Well, it sounds like a code word.
[03:17:19.040 --> 03:17:21.040]  Am I like a fellow traveler?
[03:17:21.040 --> 03:17:22.040]  Like a communist?
[03:17:22.040 --> 03:17:23.040]  No.
[03:17:23.040 --> 03:17:25.160]  No, no, like a freemason.
[03:17:25.160 --> 03:17:29.440]  You always talk about the grand architect and the creator and all that stuff.
[03:17:29.440 --> 03:17:33.240]  Well, the Bible calls God the grand architect, you have to understand that the occult groups
[03:17:33.240 --> 03:17:36.680]  from all that have taken over all these different symbols and names.
[03:17:36.680 --> 03:17:38.680]  And no, the answer is I'm not a mason.
[03:17:38.680 --> 03:17:43.680]  So you're now saying I didn't really sneak in Bohemian Grove on my own.
[03:17:43.680 --> 03:17:48.240]  Well, I'm saying it's almost impossible to actually get through all the razor wire that's
[03:17:48.240 --> 03:17:49.240]  around them.
[03:17:49.240 --> 03:17:52.160]  Did I put my did I put my pants on this morning?
[03:17:52.160 --> 03:17:58.640]  No, no, hold on, hold on, let me ask you another question since you're saying all this.
[03:17:58.640 --> 03:18:01.400]  When were you to Bohemian Grove?
[03:18:01.400 --> 03:18:03.640]  When was I to be Bohemian Grove?
[03:18:03.640 --> 03:18:04.640]  Yeah.
[03:18:04.640 --> 03:18:06.280]  I was there a few years ago.
[03:18:06.280 --> 03:18:07.280]  Okay.
[03:18:07.280 --> 03:18:08.280]  So you understand.
[03:18:08.280 --> 03:18:10.280]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[03:18:10.280 --> 03:18:12.360]  You understand space time continuum.
[03:18:12.360 --> 03:18:18.120]  If I snuck in there 16 years ago and then they massively increased security, is it possible
[03:18:18.120 --> 03:18:26.000]  the topography surrounding the 1700 acre compound in between two mountain ridges bordering the
[03:18:26.000 --> 03:18:27.160]  Russian River?
[03:18:27.160 --> 03:18:31.320]  Is it possible they put up further security barriers since I snuck in?
[03:18:31.320 --> 03:18:37.560]  What you're saying is whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[03:18:37.560 --> 03:18:41.760]  You just said two years ago that you saw barbed wire there.
[03:18:41.760 --> 03:18:44.400]  You're saying it's nearly impossible for me to get in there.
[03:18:44.400 --> 03:18:46.320]  There's a video of how I got in there.
[03:18:46.320 --> 03:18:51.680]  I snuck into the parking lot, got onto one of their trucks, had code words I was given
[03:18:51.680 --> 03:18:56.640]  by a lawyer who had a friend of his that worked there.
[03:18:56.640 --> 03:18:58.080]  They had daily codes.
[03:18:58.080 --> 03:19:02.520]  I was given the daily code by insiders and I was able to get in and I explained it all.
[03:19:02.520 --> 03:19:03.520]  It's on video.
[03:19:03.520 --> 03:19:07.840]  You used the code word to get in.
[03:19:07.840 --> 03:19:08.840]  That's what I'm saying.
[03:19:08.840 --> 03:19:09.840]  No, no, no, no, no.
[03:19:09.840 --> 03:19:11.920]  You said, I don't know the code word you said.
[03:19:11.920 --> 03:19:14.960]  I knew that they had daily code words for the workers.
[03:19:14.960 --> 03:19:16.320]  I explained the film.
[03:19:16.320 --> 03:19:19.120]  We had a worker inside that helped get us in.
[03:19:19.120 --> 03:19:23.800]  John Ronson later explains all that in a book he wrote about it.
[03:19:23.800 --> 03:19:25.760]  So I'm explaining to you again.
[03:19:25.760 --> 03:19:29.480]  You don't think I couldn't sneak in there again?
[03:19:29.480 --> 03:19:31.640]  I think you're probably invited.
[03:19:31.640 --> 03:19:32.640]  You have to be invited.
[03:19:32.640 --> 03:19:34.040]  So I mean, are you on the desk?
[03:19:34.040 --> 03:19:35.040]  Okay.
[03:19:35.040 --> 03:19:36.040]  God bless you.
[03:19:36.040 --> 03:19:37.040]  Listen, I got to get to the other calls and finish up.
[03:19:37.040 --> 03:19:38.040]  You know, let Roger Stone take over.
[03:19:38.040 --> 03:19:40.240]  But I promise to go to these calls.
[03:19:40.240 --> 03:19:41.240]  Here's the deal.
[03:19:41.240 --> 03:19:44.480]  No one can believe I was ever successful on my own.
[03:19:44.480 --> 03:19:47.960]  No one can believe that I ever did anything on my own.
[03:19:47.960 --> 03:19:49.120]  I've had family.
[03:19:49.120 --> 03:19:51.600]  People then say I work for agencies that work at government agencies.
[03:19:51.600 --> 03:19:55.960]  I'm basically ashamed of that, not that they were bad people, but that any connection to
[03:19:55.960 --> 03:19:56.960]  that.
[03:19:56.960 --> 03:20:01.400]  I did this myself with the listeners, just like, you know, the Tatum guy that shot the
[03:20:01.400 --> 03:20:05.960]  video that has now it's like 70 million views on all the videos this week.
[03:20:05.960 --> 03:20:07.280]  He did that himself.
[03:20:07.280 --> 03:20:08.280]  People like that.
[03:20:08.280 --> 03:20:09.400]  He said those words.
[03:20:09.400 --> 03:20:10.400]  He did that.
[03:20:10.400 --> 03:20:14.440]  So it's like Hillary saying the Russians won the election or the Russians run me.
[03:20:14.440 --> 03:20:15.440]  No, they don't.
[03:20:15.440 --> 03:20:16.440]  Okay.
[03:20:16.440 --> 03:20:17.440]  I run info wars.
[03:20:17.440 --> 03:20:18.440]  And my crew does.
[03:20:18.440 --> 03:20:20.600]  The reason we're successful is I'm not running people.
[03:20:20.600 --> 03:20:22.080]  I hire folks that want freedom.
[03:20:22.080 --> 03:20:26.000]  Listen, Roger's here to host the show and I said I'd go to these calls, but Roger, what
[03:20:26.000 --> 03:20:27.680]  do you make of this type of crap?
[03:20:27.680 --> 03:20:30.600]  Well, Alex, I can just see it now.
[03:20:30.600 --> 03:20:36.440]  You cheek by jaw with the Rockefellers and the Rothschilds right there at the table at
[03:20:36.440 --> 03:20:37.440]  the Bilderberger Congress.
[03:20:37.440 --> 03:20:41.640]  That's why they're locking us out of the White House, banning info wars from the president,
[03:20:41.640 --> 03:20:44.800]  holding our press passes when the president gets them for us.
[03:20:44.800 --> 03:20:49.520]  That's why they're moving heaven and earth to stop us because we're establishment.
[03:20:49.520 --> 03:20:50.520]  It's an absurdity.
[03:20:50.520 --> 03:20:54.960]  Alex, you know, you were taking your life in your hands when you snuck in there.
[03:20:54.960 --> 03:20:59.240]  You knew what the security was like, but you know, you're a resourceful fellow, but the
[03:20:59.240 --> 03:21:04.840]  idea that you were invited or sometimes somehow part of their establishment power games.
[03:21:04.840 --> 03:21:05.840]  That's pretty laughable.
[03:21:05.840 --> 03:21:07.960]  Well, the guy actually followed it.
[03:21:07.960 --> 03:21:09.200]  That was 16 years ago.
[03:21:09.200 --> 03:21:10.200]  July 15th.
[03:21:10.200 --> 03:21:13.400]  It's a generation of care they have daily or it's like every two days back till they
[03:21:13.400 --> 03:21:14.400]  had code words.
[03:21:14.400 --> 03:21:15.400]  They had passes, everything.
[03:21:15.400 --> 03:21:16.480]  I couldn't get a pass.
[03:21:16.480 --> 03:21:18.640]  The guy said, look, it's too hard going through the gate.
[03:21:18.640 --> 03:21:22.320]  They might ask you other stuff, just get on these trucks in a larger area, which they
[03:21:22.320 --> 03:21:23.680]  now have barbed wire at off.
[03:21:23.680 --> 03:21:26.720]  They had some barbed wire, but it was like classic Texas bar bar.
[03:21:26.720 --> 03:21:27.720]  Now it is razor wire.
[03:21:27.720 --> 03:21:30.840]  So we had reporters there just two years ago.
[03:21:30.840 --> 03:21:36.480]  But then five years ago, the history channel wanted to try to get me to sneak in and I,
[03:21:36.480 --> 03:21:39.600]  we went there and I said, see all the bar bar, see how they shut this down.
[03:21:39.600 --> 03:21:41.120]  You can't do it.
[03:21:41.120 --> 03:21:44.040]  They make you get on trucks with double IDs in town.
[03:21:44.040 --> 03:21:46.120]  I said, we've got to try the Russian River entrance.
[03:21:46.120 --> 03:21:51.040]  And when I pulled up there, I saw the cops waiting for us and I ran, I escaped.
[03:21:51.040 --> 03:21:52.600]  They all got arrested.
[03:21:52.600 --> 03:21:53.600]  It's on tape.
[03:21:53.600 --> 03:21:54.600]  I'm sorry, Roger.
[03:21:54.600 --> 03:21:55.600]  Go ahead.
[03:21:55.600 --> 03:22:03.240]  And now Alex, it's really extraordinary because in all honesty, talking about the Bilderbergers,
[03:22:03.240 --> 03:22:08.600]  when we have the effort to take down our president about to go down and that the people we're
[03:22:08.600 --> 03:22:14.880]  talking about are those who are orchestrating the coming attempt on to remove President
[03:22:14.880 --> 03:22:15.880]  Trump.
[03:22:15.880 --> 03:22:21.280]  I have no doubt whatsoever that Mueller is now going into high gear.
[03:22:21.280 --> 03:22:22.280]  This investigation.
[03:22:22.280 --> 03:22:23.280]  Let's stop right there.
[03:22:23.280 --> 03:22:26.960]  Let's stop right there and start over here because I kind of hijacked the show here in
[03:22:26.960 --> 03:22:27.960]  the shower.
[03:22:27.960 --> 03:22:30.360]  I apologize, but I promise to go to calls.
[03:22:30.360 --> 03:22:33.640]  But let's start over because they've said they want to overthrow him.
[03:22:33.640 --> 03:22:36.680]  They said two months ago, within two months, we're going to overthrow him.
[03:22:36.680 --> 03:22:40.400]  You'll see they had the former deputy director of the FBI and the former deputy director
[03:22:40.400 --> 03:22:41.520]  of the CIA.
[03:22:41.520 --> 03:22:43.760]  We're going to kill the president on CNN.
[03:22:43.760 --> 03:22:45.000]  So this is all facts.
[03:22:45.000 --> 03:22:46.520]  They're planning COG.
[03:22:46.520 --> 03:22:48.080]  They're planning race war.
[03:22:48.080 --> 03:22:50.280]  That's all failing, but they're still moving forward.
[03:22:50.280 --> 03:22:53.520]  So let's big breaking news from Roger Stone.
[03:22:53.520 --> 03:22:54.960]  Tell us the data done.
[03:22:54.960 --> 03:22:59.760]  Well, Alex, in the time that we have left and I can pick it up on the other side, skip
[03:22:59.760 --> 03:23:00.760]  in the break.
[03:23:00.760 --> 03:23:09.520]  As you know, General John Kelly has begun a purge of all the Trump loyalists left in
[03:23:09.520 --> 03:23:11.000]  the White House.
[03:23:11.000 --> 03:23:16.680]  Steve Bannon, Steve Miller and trade advisor Peter Navarro were the last three veterans
[03:23:16.680 --> 03:23:21.480]  of the campaign, core believers in the Trump agenda.
[03:23:21.480 --> 03:23:28.600]  Yesterday, in a stunning move, Kelly made a move on Peter Navarro, essentially taking
[03:23:28.600 --> 03:23:36.600]  his policy trade management office and folding it under the National Economic Office of Goldman
[03:23:36.600 --> 03:23:41.680]  Sachs alum and Kelly ally, Gary Cohn.
[03:23:41.680 --> 03:23:46.440]  This is humiliating an attempt to drive Navarro out.
[03:23:46.440 --> 03:23:51.480]  Navarro is the one man in the administration who has been pushing for the renegotiation
[03:23:51.480 --> 03:23:52.480]  of NAFTA.
[03:23:52.480 --> 03:23:57.000]  It was also Navarro who advised the president not to go forward in TPP.
[03:23:57.000 --> 03:24:01.840]  And by the way, Miller is awesome and is the guy writing the speeches right now, a super
[03:24:01.840 --> 03:24:02.840]  patriot.
[03:24:02.840 --> 03:24:04.080]  And so they're going after him, too.
[03:24:04.080 --> 03:24:05.080]  This is horrible news.
[03:24:05.080 --> 03:24:07.760]  Well, that remains to be seen.
[03:24:07.760 --> 03:24:11.600]  Miller so far is safe, but a few weeks ago we thought Navarro was safe.
[03:24:11.600 --> 03:24:13.160]  Before that, we thought Bannon was safe.
[03:24:13.160 --> 03:24:18.440]  Now, I had my disagreements with Steve Bannon, but it wasn't about what was in his heart.
[03:24:18.440 --> 03:24:21.880]  He is very clearly, Navarro is an ally of his.
[03:24:21.880 --> 03:24:23.280]  Navarro is a very good man.
[03:24:23.280 --> 03:24:27.920]  Navarro, it was selected by the president, first to become an assistant to the president
[03:24:27.920 --> 03:24:31.400]  for trade management, but then was given his own shop.
[03:24:31.400 --> 03:24:33.280]  The shop is down to him.
[03:24:33.280 --> 03:24:35.600]  He's being blocked from any access to the president.
[03:24:35.600 --> 03:24:38.400]  He can't get paper to the president.
[03:24:38.400 --> 03:24:41.000]  There's nobody else pushing for the renegotiations.
[03:24:41.000 --> 03:24:43.320]  And they've gotten rid of his bodyguard.
[03:24:43.320 --> 03:24:45.040]  They won't let his family in.
[03:24:45.040 --> 03:24:46.640]  Why is Trump allowing this to happen?
[03:24:46.640 --> 03:24:48.440]  Because he's still doing a great job.
[03:24:48.440 --> 03:24:50.080]  The tax cut, all of it's great.
[03:24:50.080 --> 03:24:51.360]  He's doing a good job.
[03:24:51.360 --> 03:24:53.360]  Why is he letting himself be surrounded?
[03:24:53.360 --> 03:24:56.960]  Well, it's very hard to know what the president knows and what he doesn't know.
[03:24:56.960 --> 03:25:01.360]  Alex, you don't know that he even knows Navarro is being squeezed.
[03:25:01.360 --> 03:25:04.880]  They would like Navarro to resign in a fit of peak.
[03:25:04.880 --> 03:25:12.200]  He's now been assigned to report to his nemesis to the guy who he gets in shouting at.
[03:25:12.200 --> 03:25:13.200]  And that's clear.
[03:25:13.200 --> 03:25:15.600]  Just like Scaramucci, they say, oh, the president's let you go.
[03:25:15.600 --> 03:25:17.600]  And then other folks advise him, no, just stay.
[03:25:17.600 --> 03:25:19.000]  And it wasn't true.
[03:25:19.000 --> 03:25:20.720]  And he stayed there for six more months.
[03:25:20.720 --> 03:25:22.840]  They're messing with Navarro.
[03:25:22.840 --> 03:25:25.840]  Does he know this is a mind game?
[03:25:25.840 --> 03:25:28.560]  You know, it remains to be seen.
[03:25:28.560 --> 03:25:31.920]  This is a very, very big move here.
[03:25:31.920 --> 03:25:34.040]  And you're now down to two loyalists.
[03:25:34.040 --> 03:25:39.240]  Yes, I predict that Stephen Miller, who I think did a superb job on that UN speech, is
[03:25:39.240 --> 03:25:40.240]  next.
[03:25:40.240 --> 03:25:47.400]  Now, Miller has always been able to forge temporary alliances to kind of stay in the game.
[03:25:47.400 --> 03:25:49.920]  And he is the president's best writer.
[03:25:49.920 --> 03:25:50.920]  I like him.
[03:25:50.920 --> 03:25:52.560]  They call him the minister of truth.
[03:25:52.560 --> 03:25:56.560]  But I fear that his head will be on the chopping block next.
[03:25:56.560 --> 03:25:59.240]  Here's the other startling thing, Alex.
[03:25:59.240 --> 03:26:02.320]  And here is even more startling breaking news.
[03:26:02.320 --> 03:26:07.560]  The president has long said that he believed he was under surveillance during the election
[03:26:07.560 --> 03:26:10.960]  campaign and afterwards as president-elect.
[03:26:10.960 --> 03:26:16.240]  I have now absolutely had it confirmed that his phone calls are being monitored now.
[03:26:16.240 --> 03:26:20.160]  All office daytime phone calls are being monitored by General Kelly.
[03:26:20.160 --> 03:26:24.440]  In other words, General Kelly is listening into the president's phone calls.
[03:26:24.440 --> 03:26:25.720]  This is beyond bombshell.
[03:26:25.720 --> 03:26:30.040]  You have sources and your sources have always been impeccable, specifically that Trump is
[03:26:30.040 --> 03:26:32.440]  being spied on by the chief of staff.
[03:26:32.440 --> 03:26:35.680]  This is beyond Watergate with Nixon taping people.
[03:26:35.680 --> 03:26:38.600]  Wow, does Trump know he's being spied on?
[03:26:38.600 --> 03:26:41.480]  I don't know if he is aware that this is ongoing.
[03:26:41.480 --> 03:26:47.040]  But there are new White House tapes and this was originally used to try to manipulate and
[03:26:47.040 --> 03:26:50.520]  trick the president into saying something wrong sometime.
[03:26:50.520 --> 03:26:53.360]  This is what you warned of months ago.
[03:26:53.360 --> 03:26:57.440]  So I think what's happened here is that Kelly is probably recording the conversations for
[03:26:57.440 --> 03:27:02.080]  future review because, of course, he doesn't have time to sit there with earphones listening.
[03:27:02.080 --> 03:27:07.880]  Al Haig used to listen to Nixon's calls without his knowledge in the period in which Nixon
[03:27:07.880 --> 03:27:13.080]  was becoming extraordinarily unhinged over Watergate.
[03:27:13.080 --> 03:27:15.080]  But this is a different thing.
[03:27:15.080 --> 03:27:21.760]  Now here's the question, is Kelly also monitoring the calls in the evening from the residents?
[03:27:21.760 --> 03:27:25.440]  Or is Kelly monitoring cell phone calls that the president is making?
[03:27:25.440 --> 03:27:28.240]  And of course, what does the president know and when does he know it?
[03:27:28.240 --> 03:27:33.480]  I have three different White House sources who have assured me that every daytime business
[03:27:33.480 --> 03:27:38.120]  hour phone call by the president is monitored by General Kelly.
[03:27:38.120 --> 03:27:39.120]  Wow.
[03:27:39.120 --> 03:27:44.560]  And so you have sources that, I mean, as much as you can tell us about the sources, what
[03:27:44.560 --> 03:27:46.120]  they said specifically?
[03:27:46.120 --> 03:27:52.600]  Well, they are sources that see the president every day and we're in his orbit, are in his
[03:27:52.600 --> 03:27:53.600]  orbit.
[03:27:53.600 --> 03:27:59.680]  And they tell me that this is known at the staff level, just probably not known by the
[03:27:59.680 --> 03:28:00.680]  president.
[03:28:00.680 --> 03:28:04.640]  And bad enough, we now know that he was being fired on last year.
[03:28:04.640 --> 03:28:09.840]  We now know that the Deep State was tapping Trump Tower, as we said they were, monitoring
[03:28:09.840 --> 03:28:12.200]  Paul Manafort, among others.
[03:28:12.200 --> 03:28:18.040]  But it seems to me that Kelly is just the newest Deep Stater to be surveilling the president
[03:28:18.040 --> 03:28:19.040]  of the United States.
[03:28:19.040 --> 03:28:22.040]  He's kind of picking it up where Obama left off.
[03:28:22.040 --> 03:28:23.440]  And of course, we know he's worked with them.
[03:28:23.440 --> 03:28:28.320]  So do you think Trump will be happy when he learns that Kelly's got this all being recorded
[03:28:28.320 --> 03:28:32.280]  and probably shoveled off to betray us, and probably the Clintons, I mean, that's probably
[03:28:32.280 --> 03:28:33.280]  George Soros.
[03:28:33.280 --> 03:28:36.320]  We know, we know that McMaster reports daily to Soros.
[03:28:36.320 --> 03:28:42.560]  Well, and we also know that McMaster was this close to being dismissed.
[03:28:42.560 --> 03:28:48.240]  The White House Counsel, Don McGahn, has compiled a report about McMaster's public drunkenness
[03:28:48.240 --> 03:28:49.960]  in multiple locations.
[03:28:49.960 --> 03:28:55.880]  And his head was on the chopping block at the exact time that Wright's previous was
[03:28:55.880 --> 03:28:58.880]  replaced by General Kelly.
[03:28:58.880 --> 03:29:03.800]  General Kelly then swooped in and saved his protege, his fellow general.
[03:29:03.800 --> 03:29:04.800]  That was perfect.
[03:29:04.800 --> 03:29:08.720]  He knew a coup was coming against him, so he acted like he was part of Cleaning House,
[03:29:08.720 --> 03:29:12.480]  but used that just for a week with Scaramucci, then dynamited him.
[03:29:12.480 --> 03:29:17.960]  Well, and unfortunately, after our friend Steve Bannon helped General Kelly get to where
[03:29:17.960 --> 03:29:23.440]  he is, because it was Bannon who first promoted him for Homeland Security, and then Bannon
[03:29:23.440 --> 03:29:27.880]  helped him oust Scaramucci, only he'd be ousted himself days later.
[03:29:27.880 --> 03:29:28.880]  Amazing.
[03:29:28.880 --> 03:29:31.600]  Rodney Stone will break this bombshell information down straight ahead.
[03:29:31.600 --> 03:29:35.600]  I'm out with Shows, handing them the baton, then at three o'clock, the War Room, and Roger's
[03:29:35.600 --> 03:29:39.960]  coming up back for that as well, infowars.com, newswars.com, spread those links.
[03:29:39.960 --> 03:29:40.960]  We're in a war.
[03:29:40.960 --> 03:29:42.960]  We need your help.
[03:29:42.960 --> 03:29:46.720]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.
[03:29:46.720 --> 03:29:54.800]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:29:54.800 --> 03:29:56.920]  Joe Biggs here with infowars.com.
[03:29:56.920 --> 03:30:02.240]  Today I want to talk to you about guns, why we have them, why the Bill of Rights guarantees
[03:30:02.240 --> 03:30:07.000]  that we can have them, and why my right to have a gun is more important than your right
[03:30:07.000 --> 03:30:08.960]  to rail against it in the press.
[03:30:08.960 --> 03:30:13.600]  I believe every good journalist needs to know why the Second Amendment must be considered
[03:30:13.600 --> 03:30:16.200]  more essential than the First Amendment.
[03:30:16.200 --> 03:30:21.120]  Rights may be a bitter pill to swallow, but the right to keep and bear arms is not an
[03:30:21.120 --> 03:30:26.800]  outdated, dusty idea some old dead white guys dreamed up in fear of the Redcoats.
[03:30:26.800 --> 03:30:32.320]  Now it is just as essential to liberty today as it was in 1776.
[03:30:32.320 --> 03:30:36.720]  The original amendments we refer to as the Bill of Rights contain ten of what the constitutional
[03:30:36.720 --> 03:30:39.440]  framers termed unalienable rights.
[03:30:39.440 --> 03:30:42.120]  The Bill of Rights came to us with blinders on.
[03:30:42.120 --> 03:30:44.960]  It doesn't recognize color or class or wealth.
[03:30:44.960 --> 03:30:50.040]  It protects not just the rights of actors, or editors, or reporters, but extends even
[03:30:50.040 --> 03:30:51.720]  to those we love to hate.
[03:30:51.720 --> 03:30:54.640]  This is a small excerpt from Charlton Heston.
[03:30:54.640 --> 03:30:56.520]  It's not just our water we need to filter.
[03:30:56.520 --> 03:30:58.520]  It's not just our food that needs to be cleaned.
[03:30:58.520 --> 03:31:01.400]  It's the air we're breathing, especially for our children.
[03:31:01.400 --> 03:31:07.440]  The artificial particulates of the chemicals is absolutely weighing down our immune systems.
[03:31:07.440 --> 03:31:12.400]  The same team based right here in America that brought you the Alexa Pure groundbreaking
[03:31:12.400 --> 03:31:17.360]  water filtration systems have now developed Alexa Pure Breeze, whether it's your home
[03:31:17.360 --> 03:31:22.480]  or office, you owe it to yourself, your coworkers, your family, your children, to the best job
[03:31:22.480 --> 03:31:24.240]  you can to purify your air.
[03:31:24.240 --> 03:31:29.240]  The elite are masters at poisoning our environment, while themselves doing things that mitigate
[03:31:29.240 --> 03:31:34.440]  or avoid most toxic effects to themselves, the general public doesn't.
[03:31:34.440 --> 03:31:38.400]  The Alexa Pure Breeze would be a steal at $300, $400, $500.
[03:31:38.400 --> 03:31:42.000]  One of these systems can keep 800 square feet incredibly clean.
[03:31:42.000 --> 03:31:45.560]  This is a system I'm personally putting in throughout my house, replacing older, more
[03:31:45.560 --> 03:31:48.760]  expensive filters that didn't do as good a job.
[03:31:48.760 --> 03:31:55.240]  Find out why this system is so revolutionary today, and then FullWarStore.com.
[03:31:55.240 --> 03:32:00.240]  As most of you already know, I am a voracious consumer of news and information, and in the
[03:32:00.240 --> 03:32:04.800]  last four or five years doing more and more research, I came across the fact that the
[03:32:04.800 --> 03:32:10.320]  elite establishment is fully aware of the fact that our ancient ancestors in many cases
[03:32:10.320 --> 03:32:16.120]  had much better nutrition than we do today, and our ancient ancestors sought out the bones
[03:32:16.120 --> 03:32:21.400]  of the animals that they were hunting, killing, and then processing, and so I set out to develop
[03:32:21.400 --> 03:32:27.960]  caveman, but to not just have concentrated bone broth from chicken, but seven other superfood
[03:32:27.960 --> 03:32:33.560]  ingredients known for cleansing and supercharging the body at the same time.
[03:32:33.560 --> 03:32:38.640]  Info wars isn't just fighting the globalist, we're getting results, and we're expanding
[03:32:38.640 --> 03:32:44.240]  in the face of the complete media assault and winning because of your support.
[03:32:44.240 --> 03:32:49.280]  Caveman is back in stock, people absolutely love it, so please secure your caveman today
[03:32:49.280 --> 03:33:16.120]  at infowarslives.com, or by calling toll-free, CRIPLE-A2533139.
[03:33:16.120 --> 03:33:24.560]  Welcome back, I'm Roger Stone, now taking over for Alex Jones, and reporting on the
[03:33:24.560 --> 03:33:34.640]  latest from Washington D.C., Robert Mueller seems hell-bent to indict Donald Trump, and
[03:33:34.640 --> 03:33:39.720]  insiders inside the Beltway and inside the Washington establishment believe that his
[03:33:39.720 --> 03:33:42.520]  move is imminent.
[03:33:42.520 --> 03:33:50.240]  In the meantime, we have learned that the dossier, the famous dossier created by former
[03:33:50.240 --> 03:33:57.400]  British intelligence agent Christopher Steele, and paid for twice, once by British intelligence,
[03:33:57.400 --> 03:34:05.280]  once by American intelligence, may have been the document from which the various wiretaps
[03:34:05.280 --> 03:34:09.360]  on Trump in Manafort were justified.
[03:34:09.360 --> 03:34:15.800]  This may have been the excuse they used for monitoring Trump, perhaps they knew that they
[03:34:15.800 --> 03:34:21.720]  were operating on the basis of a MacGuffin on a fraudulent document.
[03:34:21.720 --> 03:34:29.280]  And now we have found a link between Steele and Andrew Weissman, who is the chief investigator
[03:34:29.280 --> 03:34:31.280]  for Robert Mueller.
[03:34:31.280 --> 03:34:39.320]  It is Weissman who supervised the break-in raid at Paul Manafort's home in Alexandria,
[03:34:39.320 --> 03:34:47.040]  treating him like a drug dealer, taking away two folders of material that the special counsel
[03:34:47.040 --> 03:34:55.520]  already had, and then strangely going into his closet and photographing the custom Italian
[03:34:55.520 --> 03:34:57.440]  suits that he had.
[03:34:57.440 --> 03:35:00.760]  I doubt it's because he took a tax deduction for them.
[03:35:00.760 --> 03:35:02.760]  So it is harassment.
[03:35:02.760 --> 03:35:09.640]  But most in the Capitol believe that Mueller will try to leverage from Manafort some kind
[03:35:09.640 --> 03:35:17.320]  of an exchange not to be prosecuted in return for bearing false witness against the president.
[03:35:17.320 --> 03:35:26.520]  Now when I was in a press gaggle after my appearance before the House Intelligence Committee,
[03:35:26.520 --> 03:35:32.200]  I misspoke when I said that my attorneys had learned from Manafort's attorneys that he
[03:35:32.200 --> 03:35:33.200]  would be indicted.
[03:35:33.200 --> 03:35:40.440]  In fact, although the facts are not the same, we learned this from certain court documents
[03:35:40.440 --> 03:35:43.200]  and other public documents.
[03:35:43.200 --> 03:35:48.880]  And I also have not been willing to talk about my personal conversations with Paul.
[03:35:48.880 --> 03:35:49.880]  They're very general.
[03:35:49.880 --> 03:35:55.680]  I check in to see how he's holding up under what is an extraordinary onslaught of personal
[03:35:55.680 --> 03:35:59.080]  attacks and illegal wiretapping.
[03:35:59.080 --> 03:36:06.160]  Isn't it incredible that the first wiretap which was on Manafort prior to his joining
[03:36:06.160 --> 03:36:12.320]  the Trump campaign yielded nothing, zero, so they ended it.
[03:36:12.320 --> 03:36:18.640]  Then the New York Times tells us Manafort began being surveilled again under a FISA warrant
[03:36:18.640 --> 03:36:20.160]  in January.
[03:36:20.160 --> 03:36:22.880]  We now know that it was more like March.
[03:36:22.880 --> 03:36:23.880]  Wow.
[03:36:23.880 --> 03:36:29.640]  That's the exact time Manafort joins the Trump entourage, how strange.
[03:36:29.640 --> 03:36:34.640]  So it is very clear that Mueller is winding up to make his move.
[03:36:34.640 --> 03:36:37.640]  Now, what's going on in the president's camp?
[03:36:37.640 --> 03:36:40.000]  Sadly, chaos.
[03:36:40.000 --> 03:36:46.080]  The president does not have a lead lawyer who is the first among equals.
[03:36:46.080 --> 03:36:51.040]  In John Dowd, he has a question, but strong attorney.
[03:36:51.040 --> 03:36:58.680]  In Don McGahn, I think he has a relatively fine lawyer, but he doesn't have the level
[03:36:58.680 --> 03:37:02.080]  clout of an outsider.
[03:37:02.080 --> 03:37:09.480]  And then, of course, you have this fellow, Ty Cobb, who incredibly goes to a restaurant
[03:37:09.480 --> 03:37:14.720]  a block from the New York Times and is shouting at the top of his lungs that Trump should
[03:37:14.720 --> 03:37:20.160]  turn over and the White House should turn over everything Mueller asks for, which is
[03:37:20.160 --> 03:37:21.160]  suicidal.
[03:37:21.160 --> 03:37:22.160]  That's insanity.
[03:37:22.160 --> 03:37:28.840]  Don McGahn, the president's lawyer from Atlantic City, New Jersey, fine man, he has advised
[03:37:28.840 --> 03:37:30.240]  the exact opposite.
[03:37:30.240 --> 03:37:37.640]  There is such a principle as executive privilege and that normally he would agree, and there's
[03:37:37.640 --> 03:37:42.120]  nothing in the president's records that demonstrate that he's done anything wrong, but everybody
[03:37:42.120 --> 03:37:47.840]  recognized Mueller is more than capable of taking nothing and making it something, something.
[03:37:47.840 --> 03:37:54.400]  A trumped-up indictment, or in this case, charge, the special prosecutor doesn't have
[03:37:54.400 --> 03:37:59.040]  the authority to charge a sitting president, but the charge against him would, of course,
[03:37:59.040 --> 03:38:02.160]  serve for the basis for an impeachment.
[03:38:02.160 --> 03:38:07.840]  I agree with what Alex Jones said, all of this racial turmoil, all of this violence
[03:38:07.840 --> 03:38:14.400]  in the street, this is all part of one major plan to do what they could not do at the ballot
[03:38:14.400 --> 03:38:18.200]  box, which is to say, remove Donald Trump.
[03:38:18.200 --> 03:38:23.600]  They hope to achieve through a coup d'etat exactly what they achieved in the case of
[03:38:23.600 --> 03:38:27.280]  Richard Nixon and in the case of John F. Kennedy.
[03:38:27.280 --> 03:38:32.160]  In the case of Nixon, sure, he made enormous mistakes that the deep state was able to take
[03:38:32.160 --> 03:38:35.920]  advantage of, but his sin was very similar to Trump's sin.
[03:38:35.920 --> 03:38:37.680]  You see, both men are peacemakers.
[03:38:37.680 --> 03:38:43.520]  In the case of Nixon, he ended the Vietnam War faster than the Pentagon wanted to.
[03:38:43.520 --> 03:38:49.160]  He opened the door to China over their objections, and he negotiated an arms control agreement
[03:38:49.160 --> 03:38:51.080]  with the Soviets.
[03:38:51.080 --> 03:38:53.000]  Trump's sins are similar.
[03:38:53.000 --> 03:38:57.200]  He doesn't want to go to thermonuclear war over Syria.
[03:38:57.200 --> 03:38:59.040]  He has no illusions about Putin.
[03:38:59.040 --> 03:39:00.280]  He's not soft on Putin.
[03:39:00.280 --> 03:39:06.600]  He can get any help from Putin, but he understands he has to negotiate with him to preserve world
[03:39:06.600 --> 03:39:08.600]  peace.
[03:39:08.600 --> 03:39:15.480]  And the deep state is most unhappy about the failure to get the expansion of the proxy
[03:39:15.480 --> 03:39:17.120]  war in Syria.
[03:39:17.120 --> 03:39:23.240]  Hillary Clinton had promised them a no-fly zone, which they saw as a way to widen the
[03:39:23.240 --> 03:39:24.240]  war.
[03:39:24.240 --> 03:39:33.000]  Recall that General McMaster and General Kelly and General Pethus all recommended the sending
[03:39:33.000 --> 03:39:39.480]  of 150,000 troops to Syria right after the president's surgical strike on the air base
[03:39:39.480 --> 03:39:40.480]  there.
[03:39:40.480 --> 03:39:47.120]  And we now know the president narrowed that attack down to be largely symbolic, using
[03:39:47.120 --> 03:39:52.400]  it in a brilliant diplomatic move to send a message to the Iranians, send a message to
[03:39:52.400 --> 03:39:59.080]  the Chinese, send a message to the North Koreans, as well as sending a message to the Syrians
[03:39:59.080 --> 03:40:03.520]  that this was not Barack Obama, that he was not some pushover.
[03:40:03.520 --> 03:40:09.280]  Now, will the surgical strike substantially change the outcome in Syria?
[03:40:09.280 --> 03:40:17.240]  No, I think it became irresistible for the diplomatic impressions it gave all the other
[03:40:17.240 --> 03:40:18.240]  nations.
[03:40:18.240 --> 03:40:25.160]  But at the same time, you notice Pethus, Kelly, and McMaster were right there recommending
[03:40:25.160 --> 03:40:27.280]  the expansion of the war.
[03:40:27.280 --> 03:40:33.520]  Now, when the president decided to stay in Afghanistan, to me, that showed that the generals
[03:40:33.520 --> 03:40:36.440]  and the neocons were getting a foothold.
[03:40:36.440 --> 03:40:46.200]  We don't know how many troops will be sent in this new deployment.
[03:40:46.200 --> 03:40:48.800]  They don't really tell us.
[03:40:48.800 --> 03:40:55.640]  This is probably a good time to mention to you that you get this kind of breaking news
[03:40:55.640 --> 03:40:59.560]  at InfoWords, and nowhere else.
[03:40:59.560 --> 03:41:05.280]  You learned today that General Kelly is spying on the president, monitoring his calls.
[03:41:05.280 --> 03:41:12.000]  You learned today that he seeks to purge Peter Navarro, the Trump loyalist, who is the president's
[03:41:12.000 --> 03:41:22.200]  chief advisor on trade, the guy pushing for the renegotiation of the NAFTA agreement,
[03:41:22.200 --> 03:41:27.200]  and the guy who advised the president not to go forward with TPP.
[03:41:27.200 --> 03:41:32.320]  You can't get this kind of news anyplace else, folks, which is why you need to help us by
[03:41:32.320 --> 03:41:37.500]  going to the InfoWords.com store where you have some extraordinary products and sales
[03:41:37.500 --> 03:41:40.040]  right now where you can do two things.
[03:41:40.040 --> 03:41:43.480]  You can help yourself, and you can help us.
[03:41:43.480 --> 03:41:49.600]  You see, we don't have George Soros or a David Rockefeller type who writes enormous
[03:41:49.600 --> 03:41:52.040]  multi-million dollar checks.
[03:41:52.040 --> 03:41:58.320]  We have to depend on the hard work of Alex Jones and the journalists here at InfoWords.com.
[03:41:58.320 --> 03:42:01.960]  We have to count on you, our loyal listeners.
[03:42:01.960 --> 03:42:08.320]  Let me now recommend to you Alexa Pure, the pro-water filtration system, which is 20%
[03:42:08.320 --> 03:42:11.120]  off at a limited time right now.
[03:42:11.120 --> 03:42:16.440]  We already know that there are dangerous toxins in our water, our air, our food, things like
[03:42:16.440 --> 03:42:20.440]  fluoride, viruses, and bacterias.
[03:42:20.440 --> 03:42:25.440]  With this Alexa Pure Pro system, you get the cleanest, healthiest water no matter where,
[03:42:25.440 --> 03:42:27.760]  no matter what the original source is.
[03:42:27.760 --> 03:42:32.840]  It's a gravity-fed system, requires no electricity, electricity, and it's perfect for home, camping,
[03:42:32.840 --> 03:42:34.200]  traveling, and more.
[03:42:34.200 --> 03:42:39.240]  Now, my son, who is an avid camper, uses this system, and he swears by it.
[03:42:39.240 --> 03:42:45.440]  So, please, folks, go to the store now, it's 20% off, and you'll be helping yourself, but
[03:42:45.440 --> 03:42:52.880]  you're helping us continue to be the tip of the spear, and that is well worth doing.
[03:42:52.880 --> 03:42:56.280]  We'll be talking about some of the other products here.
[03:42:56.280 --> 03:43:02.200]  Pardon me, we caught me in a Marco Rubio moment there.
[03:43:02.200 --> 03:43:10.480]  Also interestingly is the fact that we can show the oomph that InfoWords has.
[03:43:10.480 --> 03:43:17.200]  Last week, we broke the story about Miles Kwok, the Clinton Bundler and fundraiser, a close
[03:43:17.200 --> 03:43:23.280]  associate of George Soros, who was in the United States as a Chinese intelligence agent.
[03:43:23.280 --> 03:43:31.800]  At a certain point, Kwok turned on his benefactors after embezzling billions of dollars in both
[03:43:31.800 --> 03:43:35.280]  the United States and in China.
[03:43:35.280 --> 03:43:41.400]  The Chinese have demanded Kwok's return, and Kwok's presence in the United States actually
[03:43:41.400 --> 03:43:49.040]  became a diplomatic stumbling block when the president met with President Xi of China at
[03:43:49.040 --> 03:43:55.520]  Mar-a-Lago to talk about getting the Chinese assistance for the North Korean problem.
[03:43:55.520 --> 03:44:01.960]  Now, due to the broadcast, which was picked up all over China by the Chinese news services,
[03:44:01.960 --> 03:44:08.400]  as well as international services around the globe, the White House appears to be reexamining
[03:44:08.400 --> 03:44:11.520]  the extradition of Kwok.
[03:44:11.520 --> 03:44:14.600]  Kwok is a longtime associate of George Soros.
[03:44:14.600 --> 03:44:20.080]  He was a fixture at the Clinton Global Initiative meetings, and he is so close to Bill and Hillary
[03:44:20.080 --> 03:44:26.160]  Clinton that they used him to provide security for their global conferences and during the
[03:44:26.160 --> 03:44:28.240]  presidential campaign.
[03:44:28.240 --> 03:44:35.040]  So now, thanks to infowars.com, this spy turncoat, who appears to have been a double
[03:44:35.040 --> 03:44:41.240]  agent for our own CIA, as well as Chinese intelligence at the same time, appears to
[03:44:41.240 --> 03:44:44.240]  be heading towards extradition.
[03:44:44.240 --> 03:44:48.760]  There's a lot more to this story, which I'll get into at five o'clock Eastern today on
[03:44:48.760 --> 03:44:54.640]  the war story, the war room, where, in all honesty, we examined the British influence
[03:44:54.640 --> 03:45:00.840]  to try to keep Kwok in the United States, and how Tony Blair took a $2 million payment
[03:45:00.840 --> 03:45:08.120]  to call and lobby the Trump White House to let Kwok stay at his luxury apartment at the
[03:45:08.120 --> 03:45:11.880]  Sherry-Netherland Hotel here in New York.
[03:45:11.880 --> 03:45:17.280]  I might say that Kwok has been seen dining with the elderly George Soros at the Cipriani
[03:45:17.280 --> 03:45:19.600]  restaurant downstairs.
[03:45:19.600 --> 03:45:24.960]  So one of the globalist elites, who has been a favorite of the Deep State and has worked
[03:45:24.960 --> 03:45:32.380]  for both sides in that war, has been fighting extradition and is now, thanks to the revelations
[03:45:32.380 --> 03:45:39.880]  at infowars.com, in deep, deep trouble and headed, perhaps, towards extradition.
[03:45:39.880 --> 03:45:43.920]  This is, of course, a rolling of Henry McMaster.
[03:45:43.920 --> 03:45:50.320]  H.R. McMaster, the general who serves as the president's national security advisor, because
[03:45:50.320 --> 03:45:56.960]  of his close ties to Soros, has led the charge to keep Kwok in the United States.
[03:45:56.960 --> 03:46:04.560]  Backed up in this, he is backed up by the CIA director, Pompeo, who clearly wants to
[03:46:04.560 --> 03:46:10.680]  hide the fact that Kwok most likely worked as a double agent, working for our CIA, working
[03:46:10.680 --> 03:46:15.560]  for Chinese intelligence at the same time, absconding with millions and millions, pardon
[03:46:15.560 --> 03:46:20.600]  me, I'm going to correct myself, billions of dollars, both abroad and here.
[03:46:20.600 --> 03:46:26.480]  This shows you the kind of global impact that infowars.com can have.
[03:46:26.480 --> 03:46:35.080]  As most of you know, I went to the House Intelligence Committee for their closed door hearings the
[03:46:35.080 --> 03:46:36.880]  day before yesterday.
[03:46:36.880 --> 03:46:42.960]  I must tell you, I've now revised the famous Gore Vidal saying, never give up a chance
[03:46:42.960 --> 03:46:49.760]  to have sex, be on television, or testify for a congressional committee.
[03:46:49.760 --> 03:46:52.640]  It was a very tense situation.
[03:46:52.640 --> 03:46:57.880]  I will say that all of the members of the committee, Republican and Democrats, conducted
[03:46:57.880 --> 03:47:03.760]  themselves in a professional and courteous way, yet there were clashes between the Republicans
[03:47:03.760 --> 03:47:05.400]  and the Democrats.
[03:47:05.400 --> 03:47:12.240]  Even though there were no real clashes between myself and the various inquisitors, I found
[03:47:12.240 --> 03:47:16.160]  that the Republicans, generally speaking, wanted to get right to the big picture.
[03:47:16.160 --> 03:47:25.200]  Mr. Stone, do you know of any collusion, coordination, or conspiring between Donald Trump, the Trump
[03:47:25.200 --> 03:47:31.560]  family, the Trump campaign, Trump associates, and Trump friends with the Russian state,
[03:47:31.560 --> 03:47:38.240]  or any Russian entity or company or individual, and the answer under oath is no.
[03:47:38.240 --> 03:47:45.640]  Did you know in advance about the content and the source of the WikiLeaks disclosures
[03:47:45.640 --> 03:47:47.880]  about Hillary Clinton?
[03:47:47.880 --> 03:47:50.240]  The answer under oath is no.
[03:47:50.240 --> 03:47:56.040]  Again, Julian Assange himself said in a tweet on the 21st of July that he had the goods
[03:47:56.040 --> 03:48:03.120]  on Hillary, I merely used a source to confirm it before reporting it here at infowars.com,
[03:48:03.120 --> 03:48:05.320]  which I did on multiple occasions.
[03:48:05.320 --> 03:48:09.520]  No, I haven't been willing to give up the name of my source.
[03:48:09.520 --> 03:48:10.720]  I am a journalist.
[03:48:10.720 --> 03:48:14.560]  I work here at infowars.com, as well as Stone Cold Truth.
[03:48:14.560 --> 03:48:18.280]  I'm on the war room every day reporting on what's happening.
[03:48:18.280 --> 03:48:25.440]  I'm certainly more of a journalist than, say, Ari Melber with MSNBC, and infowars.com is
[03:48:25.440 --> 03:48:31.800]  more of a journalistic enterprise than MSNBC could ever be.
[03:48:31.800 --> 03:48:37.360]  So there is a threat from Congressman Schiff to subpoena me for that information, to give
[03:48:37.360 --> 03:48:43.120]  up the name of a journalistic source, who I have promised protection, and I will cross
[03:48:43.120 --> 03:48:44.960]  that bridge when it comes to it.
[03:48:44.960 --> 03:48:47.680]  I was asked several times, well, what if we subpoena you?
[03:48:47.680 --> 03:48:48.680]  What are you going to say?
[03:48:48.680 --> 03:48:49.680]  What are you going to do?
[03:48:49.680 --> 03:48:50.680]  What are you going to say?
[03:48:50.680 --> 03:48:55.120]  I would be reluctant to give up a source, but let's see if I am subpoenaed.
[03:48:55.120 --> 03:49:01.160]  Other than that, I was entirely cooperative, and I took the time to demolish the myth that
[03:49:01.160 --> 03:49:04.720]  I knew about the hacking of John Podesta's email in advance.
[03:49:04.720 --> 03:49:05.720]  I did not.
[03:49:05.720 --> 03:49:10.680]  That I knew about the source and content of the WikiLeaks disclosures on Hillary.
[03:49:10.680 --> 03:49:11.680]  I did not.
[03:49:11.680 --> 03:49:17.680]  And that the conversations or exchange I had with Goosefer 2.0 on Twitter, who may or may
[03:49:17.680 --> 03:49:22.960]  not be a Russian agent, are after the fact benign and meaningless.
[03:49:22.960 --> 03:49:25.960]  They most certainly don't constitute collusion.
[03:49:25.960 --> 03:49:28.040]  So those are the facts.
[03:49:28.040 --> 03:49:29.280]  Let me say this.
[03:49:29.280 --> 03:49:37.400]  My legal expenses are now up to $500,000 between the phony lawsuit filed to me by the Obama
[03:49:37.400 --> 03:49:39.360]  crowd and these hearings.
[03:49:39.360 --> 03:49:46.520]  So if you want to go to StoneDefenseFund.com or Who Framed RogerStone.com, they threaten
[03:49:46.520 --> 03:49:48.640]  to bankrupt my family.
[03:49:48.640 --> 03:49:51.920]  This is getting very, very expensive.
[03:49:51.920 --> 03:49:54.360]  And it's meant to be a distraction.
[03:49:54.360 --> 03:49:57.520]  So I would deeply appreciate your help.
[03:49:57.520 --> 03:50:03.640]  My wife, my family, everyone thanks those who have already stepped forward to assistance.
[03:50:03.640 --> 03:50:09.520]  But the other thing you can do, folks, is go to infowars.com where you've got some extraordinary
[03:50:09.520 --> 03:50:13.000]  sales going on and we need your support.
[03:50:13.000 --> 03:50:21.120]  I point out the caveman, which is a paleo-nutritional system made of the finest agreements.
[03:50:21.120 --> 03:50:28.360]  I was with a cameraman from Infowars in Washington who told me he swears by this stuff that he's
[03:50:28.360 --> 03:50:30.400]  packed on the muscle taking it.
[03:50:30.400 --> 03:50:33.960]  So please, folks, help us here at infowars.com.
[03:50:33.960 --> 03:50:39.400]  Help us fund the counter revolution, if they're the revolution, perhaps we're the revolution.
[03:50:39.400 --> 03:50:53.800]  I'll be right back.
[03:50:53.800 --> 03:50:58.200]  What if Extendivite really works, but you find that hard to believe and you spend precious
[03:50:58.200 --> 03:51:01.640]  time looking for someone to say, just try it.
[03:51:01.640 --> 03:51:06.440]  I have my help today because of Extendivite and if I did not take a leap of faith and
[03:51:06.440 --> 03:51:09.760]  try it, well, I would be on disability today.
[03:51:09.760 --> 03:51:14.440]  Take one bottle of Extendivite as suggested for 60 days to find out for yourself.
[03:51:14.440 --> 03:51:18.720]  No need to stop any other meds you may be on, you know by now that they are not working
[03:51:18.720 --> 03:51:19.720]  for you.
[03:51:19.720 --> 03:51:24.440]  Before the 60 days are up, I know that you will feel Extendivite working for you and
[03:51:24.440 --> 03:51:26.360]  will want to take another bottle.
[03:51:26.360 --> 03:51:29.800]  Life is too short, get your Extendivite today.
[03:51:29.800 --> 03:51:34.800]  Extendivite is available in capsule or liquid form for just $69.95 for a two month supply.
[03:51:34.800 --> 03:51:46.160]  To get started, call 1-877-928-8822 that's 1-877-928-8822 or visit heartdrop.com
[03:52:53.280 --> 03:52:55.000]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[03:52:55.000 --> 03:52:59.640]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected
[03:52:59.640 --> 03:53:00.640]  by you.
[03:53:00.640 --> 03:53:05.480]  All symptoms are there, loss of energy, blood sugar, spikes and drops, poor circulation
[03:53:05.480 --> 03:53:10.440]  and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.

[03:53:14.960 --> 03:53:15.960]  across America.

[03:53:20.480 --> 03:53:23.520]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look and I'm telling everyone how much
[03:53:23.520 --> 03:53:24.520]  healthier I feel.
[03:53:24.520 --> 03:53:27.160]  I recommend heart and body extract to everyone.

[03:53:32.440 --> 03:53:34.840]  keep their cardiovascular system healthy.

[03:53:54.840 --> 03:54:08.800]  And now the tip of the spear, leading the fight to take back the nation.
[03:54:08.800 --> 03:54:14.120]  It's Roger Stone.
[03:54:14.120 --> 03:54:15.120]  Welcome back.
[03:54:15.120 --> 03:54:19.960]  I'm Roger Stone and I'm sitting in for the great Alex Jones.
[03:54:19.960 --> 03:54:28.160]  A lot of breaking news today, but this report from Arizona, most of you know that President
[03:54:28.160 --> 03:54:37.800]  Trump pardoned Sheriff Joe Arpaio only weeks ago in a controversial move that left liberals
[03:54:37.800 --> 03:54:41.760]  drooling with anger, seething with anger.
[03:54:41.760 --> 03:54:47.640]  Now I have learned that a rogue federal judge in Phoenix will seek the arrest of Sheriff
[03:54:47.640 --> 03:54:53.080]  Arpaio, claiming that the President's pardon was legally flawed.
[03:54:53.080 --> 03:54:59.000]  This struggle has been going back and forth in the backstage.
[03:54:59.000 --> 03:55:06.720]  In recent weeks, excellent reports at infowars.com by Dr. Jerome Corsi about the back and forth
[03:55:06.720 --> 03:55:09.840]  in an attempt to undo the pardon.
[03:55:09.840 --> 03:55:15.880]  Here's the thing though, the Trump Justice Department has the responsibility for protecting
[03:55:15.880 --> 03:55:21.680]  the President's pardon and disciplining or moving legally against this judge.
[03:55:21.680 --> 03:55:26.920]  Since Jeff Sessions and the folks at the Justice Department and those at the White House staff
[03:55:26.920 --> 03:55:32.640]  were opposed to the Arpaio pardon to begin with, how hard will they fight to keep the
[03:55:32.640 --> 03:55:34.240]  sheriff out of jail?
[03:55:34.240 --> 03:55:38.040]  Yes, you heard this all here first.
[03:55:38.040 --> 03:55:43.120]  I am hopeful that when the President learns about this, he will direct the Attorney General
[03:55:43.120 --> 03:55:51.480]  to do what he's supposed to do, which is to argue in favor of the President's pardon,
[03:55:51.480 --> 03:55:57.080]  which, according to Judge Andrew Napolitano, is not legally flawed.
[03:55:57.080 --> 03:56:02.520]  The President has the authority to issue a pardon to any American citizen at any time
[03:56:02.520 --> 03:56:09.240]  for any offense and can do so whether that person has yet been charged or not.
[03:56:09.240 --> 03:56:15.360]  In the case of Gerald R. Ford, he pardoned Richard Nixon for any and all crimes, even
[03:56:15.360 --> 03:56:21.520]  though Nixon had not been indicted for anything, although he most certainly, probably, could
[03:56:21.520 --> 03:56:28.680]  have been in that legal mugging, where you had the White House pardon me, the Watergate
[03:56:28.680 --> 03:56:34.640]  Special Prosecutor dealing with DOJ and the judge, ex-partite.
[03:56:34.640 --> 03:56:40.760]  You had the Watergate Special Prosecutor meeting with Judge John Sorica.
[03:56:40.760 --> 03:56:46.760]  When I revealed this on NSNBC, Nick Ackerman, who was a former Watergate prosecutor, called
[03:56:46.760 --> 03:56:47.760]  me a liar.
[03:56:47.760 --> 03:56:49.840]  But I proved that he was wrong.
[03:56:49.840 --> 03:56:55.480]  That's why, after my testimony, he went on MSNBC and said I lied to the House Intelligence
[03:56:55.480 --> 03:56:56.480]  Committee.
[03:56:56.480 --> 03:56:57.720]  No, Nick, I didn't lie.
[03:56:57.720 --> 03:56:59.240]  I just embarrassed you.
[03:56:59.240 --> 03:57:00.240]  That's all.
[03:57:00.240 --> 03:57:02.440]  And you don't seem to be able to stand up to it.
[03:57:02.440 --> 03:57:04.640]  This is Roger Stone.
[03:57:04.640 --> 03:57:08.360]  Keep an eye on that breaking our PIO situation.
[03:57:08.360 --> 03:57:09.360]  It's tense.
[03:57:09.360 --> 03:57:14.720]  And I'd be concerned because I just have lost confidence in Jeff Sessions.
[03:57:14.720 --> 03:57:20.960]  Sessions seems more interested in cracking down on medicinal marijuana and asset forfeiture
[03:57:20.960 --> 03:57:26.360]  programs that boggle the mind, where they take all of your possessions and sell them
[03:57:26.360 --> 03:57:29.640]  prior to you being convicted of a crime.
[03:57:29.640 --> 03:57:34.720]  That's why I have said, perhaps it's time for Jeff Sessions to go over to Homeland Security
[03:57:34.720 --> 03:57:40.880]  and to get an attorney general who's prepared to go after the Obama NSA, Rice, Brennan,
[03:57:40.880 --> 03:57:50.680]  Clapper, Rogers, et al., as well as going after the Clinton Foundation, which, as we
[03:57:50.680 --> 03:57:58.360]  know, is not a charity but a slush fund for grifters, and which served as the vehicle
[03:57:58.360 --> 03:58:02.880]  for the facilitation of multi-million dollar bribes.
[03:58:02.880 --> 03:58:06.520]  It's pretty clear what a new attorney general needs to do.
[03:58:06.520 --> 03:58:10.440]  Folks, again, give us your support at infowars.com.
[03:58:10.440 --> 03:58:17.280]  The famous iconic Clinton t-shirt, still available, but not many more of, and when they go, that
[03:58:17.280 --> 03:58:18.280]  will be it.
[03:58:18.280 --> 03:58:20.040]  There will be no more originals.
[03:58:20.040 --> 03:58:24.000]  This will be a valuable collector's item you can pass down to your friends.
[03:58:24.000 --> 03:58:27.560]  Alex Jones put this on the map in the last election.
[03:58:27.560 --> 03:58:30.920]  Thank you so much for joining me, and victory or death.
[03:58:30.920 --> 03:58:31.920]  I'm Roger Stelton.
[03:58:31.920 --> 03:58:59.680]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
