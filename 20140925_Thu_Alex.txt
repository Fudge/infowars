[00:00.000 --> 00:12.080]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.080 --> 00:20.840]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:20.840 --> 00:29.480]  global stocks drop not just here around the world dows down with 200 points amid global worries
[00:29.480 --> 00:36.400]  breaking that down the attorney general Eric Holder one of the most corrupt we've ever seen former
[00:36.400 --> 00:41.440]  deputy attorney general running the cover-up of Oklahoma City we even have his emails on that
[00:41.440 --> 00:47.720]  the cover-up of what really happened there he is to step down he is now to step down remember a
[00:47.720 --> 00:53.640]  few months ago he was in the hospital I think that's basically a cover for the fact that they
[00:53.640 --> 00:59.280]  want to say this is medical no it's about fast and furious it's about the IRS targeting with
[00:59.280 --> 01:08.760]  tea party it's about the fact that he's such a discrediting titular head that he is now stepping
[01:08.760 --> 01:16.000]  down so they can reshuffle things like they did with big sis and put in Jay Johnson that no one
[01:16.000 --> 01:22.920]  can even pronounce his first name properly to depoliticize the police state rollout that is
[01:22.920 --> 01:31.520]  taking place so this is more of the rats leaving the sinking ship there are just two Obama originals
[01:31.520 --> 01:39.440]  that remain the Washington Post is reporting and then there were two that's all that's left in the
[01:39.440 --> 01:46.160]  messiahs according to the Democrats he's the Messiah that's all that's left is a original band
[01:46.160 --> 01:54.880]  of married men and women with Holder's resignation just two Obama originals will remain with his
[01:54.880 --> 01:59.520]  announcement today that he's stepping down as attorney general only two original cabinet members
[01:59.520 --> 02:08.800]  remain just education secretary Arnie Duncan agriculture secretary Tom Ville Vilsack I guess
[02:08.800 --> 02:15.120]  you said who we hear may also have one foot out the door have been with Obama since the very
[02:15.120 --> 02:21.240]  beginning in their original roles and of course Holder formally comes from a law firm and lobbying
[02:21.240 --> 02:27.640]  firm that that all these politicians go and shine up with that's a revolving door with the
[02:27.640 --> 02:34.560]  Justice Department the FBI and then if you're in that law firm or you are a client it's like
[02:34.560 --> 02:41.600]  a get out of jail free cart so it's time to cash in and get some $200,000 speeches under his belt
[02:42.400 --> 02:48.160]  it's time to cash in and get some security contracts maybe he'll go to be the CEO of a naked
[02:48.160 --> 02:56.080]  body scanner company like Chertoff maybe he'll become the head of a university and cash in cash
[02:56.080 --> 03:02.240]  in on that front with federally funded bodyguards for the rest of his life as he openly lobbies to
[03:02.240 --> 03:06.800]  have you and your family disarmed it was the Veritas project James O'Keeffe went out to his house
[03:08.480 --> 03:12.880]  there in I guess it was New York where his family was at and
[03:15.920 --> 03:20.960]  there were armed guards there and a police car parked out front wouldn't it be nice if all of
[03:20.960 --> 03:26.960]  us could have that of course we can't because then who's even gonna guard other people's houses if
[03:26.960 --> 03:33.280]  the cops already garden the cops houses then there'll be no people left to actually work in the
[03:34.000 --> 03:37.280]  farms and work in the factories of course there's not many of those left
[03:37.280 --> 03:42.480]  to begin with so I guess that's part of the overall plan here's the question why is Holder
[03:42.480 --> 03:47.440]  stepping down now I think it's part of cashing in depoliticizing things when all these criminal
[03:47.440 --> 03:53.040]  investigations are coming to a head there are a lot of reasons for it and I want to open the
[03:53.040 --> 03:59.680]  phones up to get your take on that and why you think the Dow Jones industrial is down 200 points
[03:59.680 --> 04:12.480]  with apple sinking 3% global conflicts fuel nosedive says USA today we got an email two days
[04:12.480 --> 04:17.600]  ago it was brought to my attention yesterday we probably need to black this out before I show it
[04:17.600 --> 04:25.600]  but it came in at whistleblowers at info wars dot com and so it opened the phones up I specifically
[04:25.600 --> 04:30.800]  would like to hear from other bank executives or bank managers were you called into this
[04:30.800 --> 04:36.240]  emergency meeting that all of the chase bank managers were called in an emergency meeting
[04:36.240 --> 04:43.920]  and they said this only happened last time when they had the collapse of the market on 708
[04:43.920 --> 04:49.680]  remember that back in 2008 and they held everybody hostage for the bank of mail out and they wanted
[04:49.680 --> 04:55.120]  me to go with this yesterday and open the phones up rob do did it was a great idea and to get
[04:55.120 --> 05:02.160]  confirmation from calling it but I didn't do it when you're out on the road the last place you

[09:57.400 --> 09:59.920]  Again, I am your host Alex Jones.
[09:59.920 --> 10:01.640]  Thank you for joining us.
[10:01.640 --> 10:08.280]  We have the head of the tour project dealing with NSA spying and how to protect yourself
[10:08.280 --> 10:11.760]  coming up for about 30 minutes at the start of the next hour, then former state police
[10:11.760 --> 10:20.960]  officer and then ran the largest and still does police training security for public schools
[10:20.960 --> 10:21.960]  and private schools.
[10:21.960 --> 10:24.240]  He's run major university security as well.
[10:24.240 --> 10:31.760]  Wolfgang Halbig who's pointed out that Sandy Hook is fake and I've had former top CIA field
[10:31.760 --> 10:34.520]  commanders on saying it's staged.
[10:34.520 --> 10:37.400]  We've got major professors in Florida saying it's clearly staged.
[10:37.400 --> 10:39.800]  I mean, it really is staged.
[10:39.800 --> 10:45.160]  We don't know exactly what went on there, but they've got kids going in one door for
[10:45.160 --> 10:49.920]  the helicopter shot and back out and back in for theater.
[10:49.920 --> 10:55.440]  They grabbed anti terror police out in the woods, dressed up in the same shooter outfit
[10:55.440 --> 10:57.280]  and then lied about it.
[10:57.280 --> 11:08.720]  They didn't dispatch a rescue helicopters, all the defaults, all of the defaults.
[11:08.720 --> 11:14.040]  The things that are standard operating procedure were turned off and now the FBI online crime
[11:14.040 --> 11:23.560]  statistics say no deaths in the reporting in Newtown in 2012.
[11:23.560 --> 11:27.920]  And then you've got all the bizarre footage of the parents coming out and laughing and
[11:27.920 --> 11:35.120]  then like getting on camera going, I mean, it's bizarre and CNN reporter and admitted
[11:35.120 --> 11:42.120]  CIA officer, I'm not kidding, look it up, Anderson Cooper, he's there and his nose disappears.
[11:42.120 --> 11:46.860]  He turns, it's clearly blue screen, so we blew it up and noticed that there's like papers
[11:46.860 --> 11:51.240]  and stuff on the street corner blowing and then it loops.
[11:51.240 --> 11:57.480]  It's the same shot, but they didn't want anybody to jump in there and say it was a hoax.
[11:57.480 --> 12:03.680]  So they did a whole hoax video, kind of like CNN did with the fake scut attacks on Saudi
[12:03.680 --> 12:15.120]  Arabia back in 1990, 1991 and that was admitted to be fake.
[12:15.120 --> 12:22.400]  So they just do all sorts of weirdness on sound stages and people say, well, this would
[12:22.400 --> 12:25.280]  bring them down if they got caught.
[12:25.280 --> 12:29.240]  Actually when you go this big with a hoax or a fraud statistically and historically
[12:29.240 --> 12:31.800]  you have a better chance of it working.
[12:31.800 --> 12:35.400]  They say if you steal a billion bucks, they make you the governor or the president, if
[12:35.400 --> 12:37.640]  you steal $100, they throw you in federal prison.
[12:37.640 --> 12:45.920]  I mean, that's kind of how it works and they've gotten away with it for a while, but now
[12:45.920 --> 12:49.520]  people instinctively know they're being lied to.
[12:49.520 --> 12:53.280]  So that's coming up for about 30 minutes of the third hour as well, we'll have news and
[12:53.280 --> 12:55.440]  phone calls the rest of it.
[12:55.440 --> 12:57.440]  Why do you think stocks are plunging?
[12:57.440 --> 13:04.520]  CNBC experts and USA Today experts and London Guardian experts, they're all saying what
[13:04.520 --> 13:09.280]  I was thinking when I saw it this morning, 200 points as of now.
[13:09.280 --> 13:13.880]  In fact, let's put that up on a screen for folks.
[13:13.880 --> 13:23.000]  The S&P is down as well, but it's down more than 200 points and it's kind of planed off
[13:23.000 --> 13:35.480]  right now, it's down 221.57 and it's actually continuing now, it just resumed its dip.
[13:35.480 --> 13:37.880]  So we'll watch that as it happens.
[13:37.880 --> 13:43.800]  But I expected to probably go back up, it could drop 2,000, 3,000 points, it would just
[13:43.800 --> 13:49.040]  go back up because there's so many fiat dollars and other fiat currencies and there's a global
[13:49.040 --> 13:53.440]  race to devalue currencies, well where are you going to put that money, you're going
[13:53.440 --> 13:57.680]  to put it in stock markets, you're going to put it in real estate, you're going to put
[13:57.680 --> 14:00.800]  it in farmland, you're going to put it in gold and silver and that's what the elites
[14:00.800 --> 14:01.800]  are doing.
[14:01.800 --> 14:04.720]  Now they don't want you getting into gold and silver because then that would drive
[14:04.720 --> 14:11.440]  it up too fast and really show like a cold storm the underlying infection.
[14:11.440 --> 14:17.560]  But it can only be put off so long, so I want to get your take on that.
[14:17.560 --> 14:23.360]  Now of course the attorney general and I'm sad to see this happen because the longer
[14:23.360 --> 14:28.400]  he stayed in the more heat would be pressed with his cover up of Benghazi, he's been involved
[14:28.400 --> 14:33.120]  in that helping go after whistleblowers here in the US, his cover up of Fast and Furious
[14:33.120 --> 14:38.720]  caught red handed staging that with big sis who already left of course to go head up UC
[14:38.720 --> 14:46.760]  Davis and then we've got, we've got all the other things he's been involved with persecuting
[14:46.760 --> 14:53.400]  Christian groups, pro-lifers, veterans, the tea party, just tens of thousands of audits
[14:53.400 --> 14:58.240]  and harassments and bank accounts being shut down and people being indicted for crooked
[14:58.240 --> 15:05.280]  toenails while this guy just commits crimes wall to wall and then goes and gives speeches
[15:05.280 --> 15:10.880]  to the media about we need to brainwash the public against guns and then he has the nerve
[15:10.880 --> 15:19.280]  to get up when he went to Ferguson, he has the nerve to go there and talk about racism
[15:19.280 --> 15:23.320]  and how he's this big victim of it, that's what people don't like him now.
[15:23.320 --> 15:30.640]  I mean give me a break holder, I bet holders never been attacked by white people physically.
[15:30.640 --> 15:35.280]  I have been attacked racially, I was thinking about it just a few nights ago and I don't
[15:35.280 --> 15:40.240]  just like black people because of it, I realize there's racist, whites, blacks you name it,
[15:40.240 --> 15:45.000]  but it's seen as kosher and acceptable by some blacks to attack white people because
[15:45.000 --> 15:49.560]  there's a score to settle and if somebody weighs 250 pounds while I bet I can be up
[15:49.560 --> 15:57.960]  this 180 pound guy back in the day, a little bit more than 180 pounds now, 230 pounds,
[15:57.960 --> 16:05.760]  was 275, that's how fat I got, but long story short, I have literally been called a cracker
[16:05.760 --> 16:11.880]  honky and had my head hammered into the concrete and when my hair all falls out there's a giant
[16:11.880 --> 16:15.960]  scar out here from like 15 stitches where my head completely split open, I mean I've
[16:15.960 --> 16:23.600]  had black people try to kill me in Dallas over and over and over again, I mean you'll
[16:23.600 --> 16:27.480]  hear about some black family attacked by the Klan once or some old black man beat up it's
[16:27.480 --> 16:33.600]  terrible, they have movies about that, what about me, what about me holder, I'm sick of
[16:33.600 --> 16:39.640]  you playing race card, how dare you, I bet money, I bet money you've never had a truck
[16:39.640 --> 16:45.720]  of white guys pull up and beat the living hell out of you, so I'm sick of it, I don't
[16:45.720 --> 16:51.360]  have any guilt, I'm not racist, I don't like Obamacare because it's a screw job and raises
[16:51.360 --> 16:57.080]  21 taxes, seven of them on people on the poverty line working poor, it's got death panels
[16:57.080 --> 17:01.080]  on it, I don't care if you're a black veteran, a white veteran, a Hispanic veteran, it makes
[17:01.080 --> 17:05.840]  my blood boil that I got secret death list that we already knew about years ago, we had
[17:05.840 --> 17:10.000]  all the veterans groups on, Joyce Riley was talking about secret death list and not giving
[17:10.000 --> 17:21.920]  treatment to troops with witnesses from the VA 15 years ago on this network, morning host
[17:21.920 --> 17:26.280]  and I would go interview the people as well, it's not because I'm some hero I expose this,
[17:26.280 --> 17:31.160]  I see these wounded warrior TV shows and adds great, give them money, I think it's great,
[17:31.160 --> 17:37.600]  but what about just taking care of troops and making sure the veterans get the health
[17:37.600 --> 17:42.280]  care and don't get put on a secret death list, oh we're not going to give you kidney
[17:42.280 --> 17:45.320]  surgery, we're not going to give you eye surgery, we're not going to give you heart surgery,
[17:45.320 --> 17:51.760]  you're 60 years old and a heart attack, just go take some painkillers, how about that discrimination,
[17:51.760 --> 17:55.680]  we're all being discriminated against while our money's stolen and taken offshore to pay
[17:55.680 --> 18:01.840]  off derivatives, we're all having fluoride put in our water, we're all being fed GMO,
[18:01.840 --> 18:07.480]  we're all being spied on by the NSA and I think the legacy of Holder is a race-baiting
[18:07.480 --> 18:12.800]  anti-gun criminal who staged Fast and Furious and got caught, we have them announcing that
[18:12.800 --> 18:16.560]  they were doing this thing in Mexico to blame the Second Amendment a year before Fast and
[18:16.560 --> 18:22.200]  Furious broke, okay, they all knew, they launched it, they ran it, his legacy though is you
[18:22.200 --> 18:27.240]  didn't get the guns despite the fact that you pulled off the state stuff at Sandy Hook,
[18:27.240 --> 18:34.800]  clearly the Boston bombing was staged, had a top former CIA field commander on, highly
[18:34.800 --> 18:40.000]  respected by the U.S. Army, on here, last week saying those were both staged and guess
[18:40.000 --> 18:46.760]  what, it's not just because he said it, we know the players, we know what went on, bare
[18:46.760 --> 18:58.840]  minimum, Tamerlan Zarnev was in a State Department program for the CIA deployed under a fake
[18:58.840 --> 19:03.680]  name and the Russians blew his cover two years before and that's a little message to everybody
[19:03.680 --> 19:10.600]  who goes and works for the CIA or the FBI as an asset, once his cover was blown he was
[19:10.600 --> 19:15.680]  put out there as a decoy and a drill and then they were set up so they could take the fall
[19:15.680 --> 19:19.520]  and the police state could pose as heroes and that's just a fact ladies and gentlemen
[19:19.520 --> 19:25.640]  just like Oklahoma City was a staged event, so I want to talk about the real reason older
[19:25.640 --> 19:29.560]  stepped down, he stepped down because he's bringing too much heat on them and they need
[19:29.560 --> 19:35.960]  to bring some new puppet in so they can get the football across the finish line, but they
[19:35.960 --> 19:45.520]  got 50 yards to go and they don't have a first down and if they pull some false flag or something
[19:45.520 --> 19:49.400]  we're watching them we're not flat footed, that's the thing, once these criminals are
[19:49.400 --> 19:54.480]  called out they're absolutely powerless, so this is a victory that he's being forced
[19:54.480 --> 19:59.480]  to step down, I'll give the number out when we come back and get into more news.

[23:06.800 --> 23:11.920]  what happens when Mother Nature throws a curveball?
[23:11.920 --> 23:16.240]  Are you prepared to live without electricity or passable roads for weeks at a time?
[23:16.240 --> 23:18.320]  Do you even have a plan B?
[23:18.320 --> 23:21.480]  If you do, are you willing to bet your life on it?
[23:21.480 --> 23:22.960]  Children left with no homes.

[24:00.320 --> 24:02.240]  There are exceptions to that rule.
[24:02.240 --> 24:03.800]  I do not know, however.
[24:03.800 --> 24:06.280]  Again, Mr. Chairman, I don't know.
[24:06.280 --> 24:07.280]  I don't know.
[24:07.280 --> 24:09.280]  I don't know.
[24:09.280 --> 24:10.280]  I don't know.
[24:10.280 --> 24:11.280]  I don't know.
[24:11.280 --> 24:12.280]  I don't know.
[24:12.280 --> 24:13.280]  I don't know.
[24:13.280 --> 24:14.280]  That I don't know.
[24:14.280 --> 24:15.280]  I just don't know.
[24:15.280 --> 24:17.680]  I don't know whether or not I just don't know.
[24:17.680 --> 24:20.680]  I don't know exactly how IRS has constructed it.
[24:20.680 --> 24:24.680]  Yeah, I don't know when the subpoena was issued, but I don't know precisely.
[24:24.680 --> 24:27.360]  I don't know.
[24:27.360 --> 24:30.680]  I don't know the specific questions, and again, I don't know what happened.
[24:30.680 --> 24:32.080]  Well, either you know or you don't know.
[24:32.080 --> 24:33.080]  I don't know.
[24:33.080 --> 24:35.080]  I don't know.
[24:35.080 --> 24:36.080]  I don't know.
[24:36.080 --> 24:37.240]  I just don't know when.
[24:37.240 --> 24:38.240]  I don't know.
[24:38.240 --> 24:41.680]  I'm not sure I know what you're talking about.
[24:41.680 --> 24:42.680]  All right.
[24:42.680 --> 24:43.680]  I did not know.
[24:43.680 --> 24:45.400]  I don't know what you are going to ask me.
[24:45.400 --> 24:47.400]  I didn't know.
[24:47.400 --> 24:49.320]  Technically, I don't know.
[24:49.320 --> 24:51.320]  I don't know.
[24:51.320 --> 24:53.320]  I don't know anything.
[24:53.320 --> 24:55.320]  I don't know.
[24:55.320 --> 24:57.320]  I don't know.
[24:57.320 --> 25:00.720]  InfoWars is live.
[25:00.720 --> 25:01.880]  And I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[25:01.880 --> 25:12.760]  Thank you for joining us again on this Thursday, 25th day, 25th day of 2014.
[25:12.760 --> 25:18.480]  I came in before the broadcast, and I said, I see you have the red siren on.
[25:18.480 --> 25:22.800]  I'll add drudge.
[25:22.800 --> 25:27.560]  Imitation is the most sincere form of flattery, obviously.
[25:27.560 --> 25:32.320]  And I said, why is it up the stock market or holder?
[25:32.320 --> 25:34.840]  And I guess the siren is out for both.
[25:34.840 --> 25:39.000]  And that's what I like is that my crew is just basically acting on their own.
[25:39.000 --> 25:40.240]  They know what's going on.
[25:40.240 --> 25:44.440]  There's informed as I am or more so, and there's a great synergy here.
[25:44.440 --> 25:48.280]  We only bring out the siren when something big happens.
[25:48.280 --> 25:52.160]  And the Dow Jones industrial average continues to fall.
[25:52.160 --> 25:55.000]  That's not good when it falls in early trading, as everyone knows.
[25:55.000 --> 26:03.040]  This is shades of 2008, and it has fallen 234.40.
[26:03.040 --> 26:10.280]  Will the Plunge Protection Team or the President's Committee on Open Markets, as it's called
[26:10.280 --> 26:15.360]  properly, that Reagan set up after the 87 crash, try to stabilize things?
[26:15.360 --> 26:16.360]  It's now been used.
[26:16.360 --> 26:21.160]  I'm not defending Reagan or even Bush Senior, but early on, it was mainly used to actually
[26:21.160 --> 26:22.720]  stabilize the stock market.
[26:22.720 --> 26:32.800]  Now under Clinton and Bush 41 and Bush 43, actually, 42, I can't even get my presidents
[26:32.800 --> 26:35.280]  right now.
[26:35.280 --> 26:42.560]  Since Clinton, they have been using it to manipulate the stock market in a big way.
[26:42.560 --> 26:47.680]  And so if they don't pump it back up, you know that they wanted to go down to then politically
[26:47.680 --> 26:53.560]  demand a bunch of new banking powers, a bunch of new banking regulations.
[26:53.560 --> 26:57.960]  Wasn't just 880-something billion that the big banks ended up getting.
[26:57.960 --> 27:04.560]  They got literally, literally hundreds of trillions of dollars of derivatives to be
[27:04.560 --> 27:12.000]  federalized and globalized worldwide, but the U.S. is the vast majority, over 60%.
[27:12.000 --> 27:16.520]  And the Wall Street Journal admits it's now two quadrillion globally.
[27:16.520 --> 27:24.200]  That's 2,000.2, because it was 2.2 last time we pulled it up from the Wall Street Journal.
[27:24.200 --> 27:27.680]  So it's estimated at 2,200 trillion.
[27:27.680 --> 27:32.160]  It's really hard to even get my mind around those numbers and say them on air, but it's
[27:32.160 --> 27:39.080]  like a Zimbabwe $100 million note that it would cost to have dinner.
[27:39.080 --> 27:44.680]  We'd have to have $100 million to have a basic dinner when the inflation a few years ago
[27:44.680 --> 27:45.680]  picked in Zimbabwe.
[27:45.680 --> 27:47.320]  Hey, it's not as bad as it used to be.
[27:47.320 --> 27:53.320]  I'm told it only cost a few million now to get a sandwich, not 100 million.
[27:53.320 --> 27:56.440]  So it's gotten a little bit better.
[27:56.440 --> 27:59.240]  Can you imagine what this will do to everybody's savings and the rest of it?
[27:59.240 --> 28:05.120]  So if it does continue to plunge this week or next week or whenever, just know it's rigged
[28:05.120 --> 28:08.520]  and that they have decided to do it.
[28:08.520 --> 28:14.360]  But it is continuing to fall as we speak right now.
[28:14.360 --> 28:16.200]  Now it's down another 15 points or so.
[28:16.200 --> 28:21.960]  The last minute, it's now down 246 points.
[28:21.960 --> 28:28.640]  Now, will they just ride it down like a rigged casino and watch everybody jump out and then
[28:28.640 --> 28:32.200]  buy because they know it's about to go back up this afternoon?
[28:32.200 --> 28:33.200]  Sure.
[28:33.200 --> 28:37.240]  I mean, when the market's rigged, you can ride it up, ride it down, ride it all over
[28:37.240 --> 28:44.160]  the place because you're part of the insider group.
[28:44.160 --> 28:46.320]  What's your take on all of this?
[28:46.320 --> 28:47.320]  What's bigger news?
[28:47.320 --> 28:48.320]  The stock market?
[28:48.320 --> 28:49.320]  What do you think is more important?
[28:49.320 --> 28:52.000]  The stock market or Eric Holder?
[28:52.000 --> 28:58.360]  At the end of the day, both are just rigged commodities and just fronts for the shadowy
[28:58.360 --> 29:01.960]  machinery behind the curtain.
[29:01.960 --> 29:06.520]  But through all of these stories, we can learn what the little man behind the curtain is
[29:06.520 --> 29:08.420]  really up to and really doing.
[29:08.420 --> 29:17.760]  You can almost call this broadcast behind the curtain news or paradigm shift because
[29:17.760 --> 29:20.280]  it isn't about believing what I believe.
[29:20.280 --> 29:24.440]  It's about learning what's really going on and then from your perspective, deciding what
[29:24.440 --> 29:25.440]  you're looking at.
[29:25.440 --> 29:30.160]  Of course, a lot of folks have found that what I think I'm seeing is a lot more accurate
[29:30.160 --> 29:32.760]  than what almost anyone else is saying.
[29:32.760 --> 29:37.400]  We'll be right back with a toll-free number to join us on any of these news items or issues.

[33:32.300 --> 33:34.700]  And the surveillance system is all about
[33:35.500 --> 33:37.500]  Turning you into an abject

[33:40.260 --> 33:45.940]  The sands of time for freedom and the free market and prosperity are running low
[33:45.940 --> 33:57.860]  The sands of time for me are running low. And I'm not being alarmist here. I'm being factually based
[33:59.380 --> 34:01.380]  Running low
[34:03.380 --> 34:05.380]  Got a chance to meet some of the folks from Iron Maiden
[34:05.900 --> 34:12.100]  Back stage when I was with Megadeth and at least the trauma for this pretty cool guy. We need to get him on some time
[34:12.100 --> 34:23.940]  I like this part right here. Monday through Friday from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. Central
[34:23.940 --> 34:29.740]  I'm not name-dropping when I tell stories like that. It just is showing that freedom is popular
[34:31.700 --> 34:33.700]  Running low
[34:33.700 --> 34:38.860]  Oh, that's hard to turn off crank it up
[34:38.860 --> 34:49.580]  Look to the bars of the last of the wall that has gone very wrong
[35:00.220 --> 35:04.260]  I'm gonna go to your phone calls. What do you think the
[35:05.140 --> 35:07.140]  biggest
[35:07.140 --> 35:13.780]  scandal of Obama aka Eric Holder because he's there aiding and abetting covering up
[35:14.300 --> 35:16.300]  Obsconding racketeering
[35:16.380 --> 35:19.820]  Suppressing persecuting going after political enemies
[35:21.060 --> 35:23.060]  Throwing the book at people that have done nothing
[35:23.820 --> 35:29.220]  Running his giant witch hunt operation while protecting the big mega banks looting the country
[35:29.220 --> 35:34.820]  Protecting an entire bipartisan takeover
[35:37.020 --> 35:42.300]  What do you think's really going on? What do you think is really really happening here?
[35:42.300 --> 35:47.620]  I want to hear from you. We know he's a criminal. We know he's escaped impeachment. We know he's escaped
[35:49.140 --> 35:54.500]  Ignoring Congressional subpoenas. He's been arrogant. He's been threatening. So it's important to
[35:55.340 --> 35:58.060]  Pillory him as he rides off on a golden carpet
[35:58.060 --> 36:02.500]  To loot the taxpayers in the revolving door
[36:04.220 --> 36:08.340]  But what is your view on Eric Holder, what is your view on what's happening with the stock market?
[36:08.900 --> 36:11.940]  800 25 at 990 231
[36:13.180 --> 36:15.580]  Now before I go to your phone calls
[36:16.740 --> 36:23.820]  There is a product from info wars life comm developed by dr. Group that you've got to go read about online
[36:24.340 --> 36:26.840]  It's got all of these different
[36:26.840 --> 36:30.600]  Concentrated flower and plant and
[36:31.480 --> 36:33.480]  root extracts
[36:33.640 --> 36:38.800]  I mean just a whole bunch of them and you've got to understand that when you normally buy a
[36:39.960 --> 36:41.800]  similar product in
[36:41.800 --> 36:47.800]  Claims it'll just have some menthol and maybe one urban under something and I'm not knocking Ricola
[36:48.640 --> 36:53.920]  But you know, let's say it's got three or four herbs in it compared to Ludens that has nothing this has
[36:53.920 --> 36:55.600]  I
[36:55.600 --> 37:00.600]  Think it's like 14 different things one two three four five six
[37:01.320 --> 37:08.640]  seven eight nine ten eleven twelve thirteen. Yeah, fourteen things. Okay. I was right the point is
[37:09.560 --> 37:13.460]  1314 is that if you look at it in the bottle
[37:14.800 --> 37:20.880]  If you look at it in the bottle is there's no additives or fillers. It's just pure essential oil and
[37:20.880 --> 37:24.680]  Competing products are the same price
[37:25.080 --> 37:29.920]  But it's just thin water because they're cheap because people buy stuff just for the packaging
[37:30.280 --> 37:35.080]  This really is a revolutionary product and the reason I was thinking that need to plug it more
[37:35.800 --> 37:38.040]  So I did a lot of yellow when I gave a speech Saturday
[37:39.600 --> 37:45.120]  Down at Casey research and I could barely talk on Sunday and about a third of the way to the show
[37:45.120 --> 37:46.960]  I went wait a minute on Sunday
[37:46.960 --> 37:54.320]  I said why aren't I doing my lung cleanse that immediately coats my larynx or if I have really bad allergies or a sore throat?
[37:54.320 --> 37:56.320]  I mean, it's just light years better
[37:57.240 --> 38:02.160]  Than any other throat type spray lotions, but also the way group says to do it
[38:03.400 --> 38:06.040]  But you got to watch it so thick it clogs the top deals
[38:06.040 --> 38:10.120]  You got to blow it out sometimes ever you've been using it six or seven times or you put it in hot water
[38:10.480 --> 38:12.760]  The little cap because you want it
[38:12.760 --> 38:17.400]  This is a really nice spray top on it that aerosolizes it three shots in the mouth
[38:20.000 --> 38:23.600]  And on the third one you don't spray and then inhale that would be too much
[38:23.960 --> 38:29.560]  You spray three times and then go and then some of the effervescence some of the mist goes into the lungs
[38:29.560 --> 38:33.600]  And it's just amazing and then it funds our whole operation
[38:34.360 --> 38:40.440]  The subscriptions to prison planet TV the pro gun t-shirts the high-quality M4s life products
[38:40.440 --> 38:47.000]  Funds the operation so I want to thank you all for your support and just encourage all of you that have gotten the other
[38:47.120 --> 38:52.600]  Info wars life line of products out there to check out lung cleanse that I really haven't talked up enough
[38:52.600 --> 38:57.520]  It sells quite well. It's just that I haven't really talked it up enough and I think it is
[38:57.520 --> 39:01.360]  I know this group when he was developing it for us was so excited about it
[39:02.080 --> 39:04.080]  Because it is an over-the-top
[39:04.680 --> 39:09.360]  Product that if you look at it is thick. I mean, it's very thick
[39:09.360 --> 39:15.840]  And it tastes really good very minty, but also very earthy. I don't know how to describe it, but
[39:17.400 --> 39:23.600]  So many other similar things on the surface just have weird taste or just have stuff in there to make your throat numb
[39:23.600 --> 39:28.000]  This doesn't have any of that this soothes your throat without any of that artificial garbage
[39:28.800 --> 39:31.480]  Info wars life calm lung cleanse

[40:13.160 --> 40:15.160]  Okay
[40:15.200 --> 40:18.800]  After we take calls here's some of the other news we have from Kit Daniels
[40:19.400 --> 40:25.720]  From info wars United Nations to propose global lead ammo band. That's from the UN
[40:26.600 --> 40:27.760]  Proposaled
[40:27.760 --> 40:34.880]  Would serve as a backdoor gun control by cutting global supply of ammo just like I said two weeks ago where they're passing laws that basically
[40:34.880 --> 40:41.320]  Ban led ammo in California making ammo prices go up 300% it's estimated the next year maybe more
[40:42.040 --> 40:44.040]  like that was a low estimate by the
[40:44.800 --> 40:47.720]  group that broke it all down in a study
[40:49.280 --> 40:56.520]  That this is UNESCO this is UN treaties unimplemented, but California and New York and others and cities they call it UN
[40:56.520 --> 41:01.440]  Munialization under agenda 21 cities are adopting it Austin
[41:02.080 --> 41:08.840]  Where my mother grew up the I believe the best city in Texas bar none for a big town for a big city
[41:08.840 --> 41:11.200]  It's great a lot of other small towns that are much better
[41:12.360 --> 41:14.360]  Austin used to be a small town
[41:14.800 --> 41:21.000]  40,000 people and my mom grew up here now. It's 2 million, but be 4 million they're saying other 10 years. It's just exploding
[41:21.000 --> 41:26.720]  But it's officially under UN control. They don't follow the Constitution Bill of Rights
[41:28.000 --> 41:30.240]  And and there's some old line liberals here
[41:30.240 --> 41:35.840]  So there's some nice things about old line liberals about it's not too police-steady and some other things, but
[41:36.680 --> 41:43.240]  It's got that modern UN thing to it. That's seen as trendy and sexy. It's sexy a nightmare
[41:43.920 --> 41:47.080]  So that's coming up FBI says no one killed at Sandy Hook
[41:47.080 --> 41:52.480]  agency publishes crime report showing zero murders occurred in Newtown in 2012 and people could say well
[41:53.200 --> 41:57.840]  That must be an FBI crime statistic mistake and that does happen sometimes
[41:58.080 --> 42:03.200]  I'm a big critic of a lot of what the FBI does but their statistics have been known over the years to be the best in the world
[42:03.680 --> 42:10.720]  Started by J. Edgar Hoover. That's what he was with statistician and basically a filing clerk who was a master at organizational skills
[42:11.560 --> 42:15.440]  And it's the model worldwide in colleges for statistics
[42:15.440 --> 42:19.120]  Because it's gathered locally and then compiled
[42:20.520 --> 42:26.000]  Remember the FBI didn't put some of it laden on the most wanted list for 9-eleven. I
[42:28.280 --> 42:30.840]  Guess cuz they didn't want to bounty out there for him or something
[42:31.040 --> 42:36.000]  Four years three four years after we were making a big deal about it and there'd been national news stories about it
[42:36.480 --> 42:41.560]  They still wouldn't put him on the most wand list. So is this some kind of inside joke or something?
[42:41.560 --> 42:49.920]  We're gonna talk to Wolfgang Halbic about that coming up cop ass man for license shoots him when he goes to get it WLTX
[42:50.480 --> 42:53.600]  the guys at the gas station gas in his car up if
[42:54.880 --> 42:59.760]  You're a TV viewer you can see this at info wars.com forward slash show if you're ready a listener go to info wars.com
[42:59.760 --> 43:04.920]  We have the video from WLTX out of South Carolina, Columbia, South Carolina up there and
[43:05.880 --> 43:09.960]  Talk about instinctive shooting. I mean this is scary the guys gas in his car
[43:09.960 --> 43:11.960]  up
[43:11.960 --> 43:12.720]  and
[43:12.720 --> 43:14.720]  We're showing the video now
[43:16.720 --> 43:17.720]  and he says
[43:19.720 --> 43:22.760]  Give me your license. So the guy turns around to get it
[43:24.120 --> 43:26.120]  And he does do it a little quickly
[43:27.800 --> 43:35.160]  Almost like a kid when you're saying put your shoes on and they kind of stomping you sit down real fast and the guy kind of turns quick
[43:35.160 --> 43:39.520]  But that doesn't give you license to kill him and the cops start shooting him
[43:40.520 --> 43:44.920]  And then he runs over to him and the cops such a bad shot. He didn't hit him center of mass
[43:46.560 --> 43:48.560]  And the guys like man, it's my license is right here
[43:49.320 --> 43:55.520]  And the cop is still like jumping on top of him after that. It's just go join special forces
[43:56.320 --> 44:00.800]  And and then you can actually go fight people that want to kill you and then you can treat them all like that
[44:00.800 --> 44:05.400]  But just it's like an attack dog like you open a door and a pit bull
[44:05.400 --> 44:09.480]  It's been eating gunpowder comes running out. You know, just just just
[44:10.320 --> 44:12.320]  just savage
[44:12.320 --> 44:14.320]  vicious crazed
[44:17.320 --> 44:24.320]  And then I read deeper into it the guy wasn't even a suspect to be one thing of it was a vehicle that matched your description of an armed robber
[44:24.320 --> 44:31.320]  Who's thought to be dangerous and served 10 years for shooting somebody then I then of the then of the guy made a move and something and I still say it was
[44:32.320 --> 44:34.800]  You know the cops too on edge and should not be a cop
[44:35.320 --> 44:42.320]  But the fact that this guy hadn't even done anything and the police are so militarized. This is how they approach you is frightening ladies and gentlemen
[44:43.320 --> 44:45.320]  Because I personally
[44:45.840 --> 44:47.840]  one time
[44:48.320 --> 44:51.320]  Sad is something no other talk shows does always say it's dangerous
[44:51.320 --> 44:55.320]  Sad is something no other talk shows does always say it's coming up and I discovered right there
[44:57.320 --> 44:59.320]  I told the story I was a senior in high school
[44:59.320 --> 45:07.320]  And I got home from the gym and my mom said hey son go up to the frozen yogurt place and get me vanilla
[45:07.320 --> 45:09.320]  Yogurt a pint of it. I said, okay
[45:10.320 --> 45:17.320]  The mama sitting there cooking dinner and I drive up my Mustang get it and I'm driving back maybe going five miles of the speed limit
[45:17.320 --> 45:22.320]  In a residential area right by my house cop busting you turn
[45:23.320 --> 45:26.320]  I'm flying up behind me comes over a roll on the window
[45:27.320 --> 45:29.320]  He goes license registration boom his guns out right to my head
[45:30.320 --> 45:32.320]  He goes get get out of the car get out of the car
[45:33.320 --> 45:37.320]  And I get out he goes. Oh, that's a white belt. I thought it was a knife scabbard or a gun
[45:38.320 --> 45:41.320]  Scabbard he goes. Oh try not to speed. Sorry
[45:41.320 --> 45:46.320]  At least he said sorry it didn't blow my head off nowadays if a cop gets mad at you half the time
[45:46.320 --> 45:50.320]  They just go ahead and beat the hell out of your taking a jail because I watch the squad car videos all the time
[45:51.320 --> 45:57.320]  Mostly when we don't even play we're not even here trying to run the police now because we understand that just feeds into the whole us against them mentality
[45:57.320 --> 46:03.320]  But I mean come on come on. I mean I've had a gun to my head over a weight belt
[46:03.320 --> 46:10.320]  I mean big deal of it was a knife scabbard when you grab a machete and kill you I mean they've got the cops so on edge
[46:10.320 --> 46:14.320]  You're gonna be killed any minute. You gotta be safe. Everything's about keeping you safe bull
[46:16.320 --> 46:20.320]  They'd be telling you not to drink fluoride not to take the vaccines not to eat GMO
[46:20.320 --> 46:25.320]  They'd be telling you about the hormone garbage they're putting in a printer ink and look it up that literally feminizes you
[46:25.320 --> 46:33.320]  They'd be telling you will be warning your kids. It's all about only we care about you the family the government the system
[46:33.320 --> 46:38.320]  We're in the federal family like big sis said let's go to your phone calls Manny in Texas
[46:38.320 --> 46:44.320]  You want to talk stocks and holder go ahead? Yes, sir. Hello Alex. Thank you for taking my calling brother
[46:44.320 --> 46:51.320]  Just a little bit of patience with me yesterday. You had talked on the show about a gentleman dealing with exorcisms
[46:51.320 --> 46:57.320]  And it really sparked my interest to talk to you and it feeds into what you're going on today
[46:57.320 --> 47:02.320]  Do you think Eric Holder needs an exorcism or maybe the stock market? No
[47:02.320 --> 47:09.320]  Hillary Clinton you know some say she actually played Linda Blair in no I'm serious in the exorcist
[47:09.320 --> 47:18.320]  And that now with Chelsea about to have a baby they're actually saying that it may be it may be Rosemary's baby
[47:18.320 --> 47:27.320]  Anyway Jesus Christ is my Lord and Savior and he has I'm an ex demoniac. Okay, I have been delivered from demons
[47:27.320 --> 47:35.320]  And I have a special relationship with God. He's really my best friend good and I just wanted to say out there that
[47:35.320 --> 47:45.320]  People shouldn't mess around with dealing with exorcisms unless they're well anchored in God and know how to deal with dealing with the forces of darkness
[47:45.320 --> 47:52.320]  I agree and you shouldn't watch in this NBC unless you're really ready to look into a demonic portal into the eyes of Mr. Mano
[47:52.320 --> 48:02.320]  Anyway, what you are what God has shared with me and he continues to share with me is what you're starting to see over the next year
[48:02.320 --> 48:11.320]  Is a period of judgment that is coming down upon the United States for the turning away from God trying to remove him
[48:11.320 --> 48:22.320]  The sins of our country the arrogance the corruption the lying the stealing the cheating the sexual sins the abortions everything
[48:22.320 --> 48:27.320]  It's all coming to pass God has been trying to get our attention for quite some time
[48:27.320 --> 48:37.320]  Now what has led to this to me is I've continually had a recurring dream of seeing a nuclear explosion over cities
[48:37.320 --> 48:50.320]  And I have been in prayer over these particular matters and God keeps dealing with me that there is going to be a situation that's going to happen and occur here in the United States
[48:50.320 --> 48:55.320]  I don't know when I don't know where I just keep having this recurring dream
[48:55.320 --> 49:03.320]  The stock market this country has a love of money and the love of money is the root to all evil
[49:03.320 --> 49:19.320]  It's it's being falsely propped up by the Fed in order to collapse it and you are starting to now see the birth pangs of the collapse that's going to occur in the market over the next year
[49:19.320 --> 49:30.320]  Well yeah they up interest rates that will probably mess with the markets we'll see what happens but but I appreciate your call sir and I agree people shouldn't mess around with demons
[49:30.320 --> 49:34.320]  That's why we shouldn't elect one as the president of the United States
[49:34.320 --> 49:45.320]  I don't normally say lesser of two evils but Hillary Clinton I would vote for a horse manure pile before I voted for her and that's because I'm against women
[49:45.320 --> 49:51.320]  That's what Rachel Maddow and others are going to say no it's because I'm against criminals and I'm sick of the Clintons
[49:51.320 --> 49:58.320]  I would vote against the Bush too I'm sick of Bushes we don't need royalty in this country
[49:58.320 --> 50:07.320]  But as bad as the Bushes are Hillary Clinton is worse she is coming after our guns she is absolutely want state run media
[50:07.320 --> 50:15.320]  She helped overthrow Libyan and made jokes about it we came we saw he died yeah and so did 50,000 Libyans or more
[50:15.320 --> 50:23.320]  So that's where I stand on that we're going to go break them back with Jeff and go to Brian, Tim, Josh and others
[50:23.320 --> 50:30.320]  What do you think the biggest scandals of Holder's administration have been because it's important to spotlight these and not forget them
[50:30.320 --> 50:45.320]  The stock market is down 248.59 on the Dow Jones industrial averages S&P is down 28.58 Nasdaq is down 79.83 right now in live trading
[50:45.320 --> 50:54.320]  Alright stay with us a lot is coming up the news websites are in howars.com and prisonplanet.com
[50:54.320 --> 50:58.320]  And I hope you visit those sites to spread the word about them because the system doesn't like them
[50:58.320 --> 51:07.320]  You heard the discussions all over the radio you couldn't believe what you were hearing you trusted them you felt betrayed
[51:07.320 --> 51:18.320]  Your emotions began to consume you outrage set in then nothing days turned to weeks and months then but they happened

[55:29.320 --> 55:43.320]  We have to get this some of the stuff from actual pharmaceutical makers that's why in the health community without us even going out and soliciting their reviews out there of DNA force people just saying there's nothing else like this
[55:43.320 --> 56:02.320]  Well we have a limited small run of these and we're going to send a mass email out today to folks that had already signed up to want to get it first and then whatever else is available is on the shopping cart right now at infowarslife.com and the great part about it is you also fund our operation

[56:22.320 --> 56:40.320]  $40 I mean this is a Rolls Royce I wish everybody could take this and afford it I'm taking it it's amazing you can go read about it and what we're even allowed to say because a lot of this stuff is certified and confirmed we're actually allowed to make some claims about this
[56:40.320 --> 56:58.320]  but it's all been done by the experts at infowarslife.com I'm not going to even get into it you can watch the videos about it and in closing if you want say the poor man's equivalent of this it's $30 it's the occupower it doesn't just work with the nerves and things and the cells in the eyes
[56:58.320 --> 57:11.320]  but that's what it focuses on but occupower is the poor man's version of this available at infowarslife.com or 888-25331-39er
[57:11.320 --> 57:17.320]  Okay enough of me babbling here Jeff in Texas you're on the air why do you think Holder stepped down
[57:17.320 --> 57:31.320]  I think he deserves to step down and of course he's going to get one of those golden parachutes that all those guys get you know I don't know what the Attorney General job pays but he's going to retire to a gated community fast and furious
[57:31.320 --> 57:48.320]  now when that occurred of course they tried to sweep it under the rug like all the other scandals that they do and the truth's coming out about this guy now he should be prosecuted so should the Bushes Obama saluting with a cup of coffee oh that's a good one
[57:48.320 --> 57:59.320]  now he's chairing the UN he's chairing the UN for climate control while he's dropping the bombs on Syria now that just sets the wrong precedent for me it is America I just I don't agree with that at all
[57:59.320 --> 58:13.320]  I totally agree with you so what do you think the biggest scandal the Obama administration is because every one of the scandals except for vacationing has been intimately connected to Holder running interference and defense for obozo
[58:13.320 --> 58:27.320]  right it's all financially related the biggest scam was Obama getting up there and telling the American people I know how unpopular it is about bailing off the banks I know but what he did and Holder and all these guys that have been
[58:27.320 --> 58:37.320]  yeah no he haunched out in the Senate they gave him credit it's in my film Obama deception for getting the bailout pass he got more money from Wall Street than anybody
[58:37.320 --> 58:48.320]  we'll be right back and again not all of Wall Street's bad it's just select few groups like Goldman Sachs that are quarterbacking all the major bad stuff okay

[01:00:23.320 --> 01:00:35.320]  i have a really bad habit because i'm completely in charge basically up here my great crew reminds me of stuff that's breaking and stories i want to get to and they make a lot of decisions
[01:00:35.320 --> 01:00:52.320]  but when it comes to running the show i'll say oh coming up i'll get to this i never do it but i will do it start the next segment we'll look at what's happening with stock market and this email we got yesterday that if people can get in on the phone lines we'd like to hear if you got any similar information at the banks you work at
[01:00:52.320 --> 01:01:05.320]  this is came in at whistleblowers and info wars dot com and it says yesterday all arizona area chase bank members were called in for an emergency meeting
[01:01:05.320 --> 01:01:14.320]  i went in to handle some account issues and the banker rep informed me that every bank manager had been called to a meeting throughout the phoenix area
[01:01:14.320 --> 01:01:30.320]  she was very puzzled by this herself and told me that she was quite concerned she had told me that the last time a situation arose like this was prior to the 2008 07 collapse of the market
[01:01:30.320 --> 01:01:48.320]  again the october collapse of the market she had also stated that none were reachable for that period even if an emergency had come up that's how important it was just a little heads up in case you got wind of anything regarding this matter
[01:01:48.320 --> 01:02:02.320]  and this came in actually yesterday morning and i didn't go with it do said hey you could you know even though it's speculation i know you don't go with that you can just open the phones up
[01:02:02.320 --> 01:02:14.320]  and offer people to call in and then send us proof to show tips and info wars dot com or whistleblowers and info wars dot com and so that is what i'm going to do now i said i do it after the break but now i'm doing it now
[01:02:14.320 --> 01:02:22.320]  customarily but i will elaborate after the break more on this and take calls but anybody that can send us any documentation
[01:02:22.320 --> 01:02:29.320]  i can't tell you how many times we've had national news stories where chase or others are about to start charging people to use their debit cards more
[01:02:29.320 --> 01:02:44.320]  or are about to not let folks take money out of their bank account or not let people have cash businesses or deposit cash bank of america or not let people have gun shops anymore or sporting goods stores that sell guns or even BB guns or they won't let you have a bank account
[01:02:44.320 --> 01:02:55.320]  and we've broken no exaggeration 20 something stories along those lines last few years that have gone national international
[01:02:55.320 --> 01:03:06.320]  so remember the power you have as whistleblowers out there now i don't want anything illegal i don't want anything proprietary but if it's public interest
[01:03:06.320 --> 01:03:17.320]  and or a lot of times it's somebody sends us their letter from chase saying we're not going to let you wire transfer money out of the country anymore all customers
[01:03:17.320 --> 01:03:26.320]  i mean that's just your public letter it's not really a whistleblower just you're just bringing our attention to something and then we went in and said is this true
[01:03:26.320 --> 01:03:37.320]  and so we walked around and said is anybody have a chase account yeah i've got one we'll go home and look at your bill they come back and go yeah it just came in the mailbox yesterday and i got my online version it's confirmed
[01:03:37.320 --> 01:03:50.320]  and that's just basic journalism it's not hard there it is update chase bank limits cash withdraws bans international wire transfers that story got read by about 2 million people on info wars
[01:03:50.320 --> 01:04:04.320]  and then if you tracked all places it got posted was one of the biggest stories on the web and again it's not me going we're a big website it's you have power when you give us information
[01:04:04.320 --> 01:04:15.320]  see something say something we're going to go to break and come back to brian and then to tim josh richard and wild man
[01:04:15.320 --> 01:04:26.320]  what do you think the biggest scandal the obama ministration and by extension holder who's been the main cover-up artist for him what does it signify do they know indictments are coming down do they know state grand juries are moving against them
[01:04:26.320 --> 01:04:39.320]  yes do they know that congress is finally getting fed up with their criminal activity and that holders and politically persecuting people show other people can play hardball streets are two way streets are two way
[01:04:39.320 --> 01:04:50.320]  that's why i don't mess with somebody unless i've got to defend myself and they're or they're really hurting somebody who's innocent because when you run around persecuting people it will come back on you
[01:04:50.320 --> 01:04:58.320]  it will burn you there been attorney generals that have gone to prison and eric holder needs to go to prison

[01:08:22.320 --> 01:08:31.320]  we've gotten a whistleblower contacts yesterday multiple ones now that we're digging through the emails saying that banks were saying brace for something big today
[01:08:31.320 --> 01:08:50.320]  I didn't go this yesterday because it might have just been basically some panicking going on in the financial system but we did get some of this chatter some of these noises right before the October collapse of two thousand and eight
[01:08:50.320 --> 01:09:02.320]  that they use to bring in so many other draconian banking rules and banker bailouts that the country was bipartisanly looted under
[01:09:02.320 --> 01:09:11.320]  but i would like you to send your emails or intel or any information you have or any documentation of what you're hearing in your area of the banking sector
[01:09:11.320 --> 01:09:21.320]  to whistleblowers at info wars dot com or show tips and info wars dot com the stock market is down 247 points on the dow jones industrial average
[01:09:21.320 --> 01:09:34.320]  they have the president's open market committee or plunge protection team in there that could prop it up if they want to but they're saying global fears of war and recession and a lot of other issues
[01:09:34.320 --> 01:09:42.320]  are are driving that right now cmbc says a toxic stew of factors
[01:09:42.320 --> 01:09:53.320]  now months ago i wanted to get this guy on we're finally able to do it i appreciate him coming on andrew lumen is executive director of the tour project tour project dot o r g
[01:09:53.320 --> 01:10:05.320]  and he's helped with thousands of volunteers to grow a successful company with a global reach and he's worked on projects with transition house google national science foundation u.s. department of defense
[01:10:05.320 --> 01:10:17.320]  reached beyond domestic violence the white house and the u.s. state department he's a strong believer in individual rights privacy anonymity and solving real world problems sometimes even with technology
[01:10:17.320 --> 01:10:27.320]  and uh... lumen l e w m a n dot i s is his website and i wanted to get him on because you know we've had
[01:10:27.320 --> 01:10:34.320]  a whole bunch of different experts on william bennie was number four at the nsa director of a major program
[01:10:34.320 --> 01:10:43.320]  we've had just countless of whistleblowers on and a lot of them recommend talking to andrew lumen and and and talk about the tour project
[01:10:43.320 --> 01:10:49.320]  so first off tell us about the tour project why folks that aren't tech savvy should want to know about this
[01:10:49.320 --> 01:10:56.320]  and then does it make you get looked at more to use tour or should you just go ahead and use it and then there's the argument that
[01:10:56.320 --> 01:11:04.320]  well if i have nothing to hide then i shouldn't hide it but that's like saying why lower your blinds at night
[01:11:04.320 --> 01:11:11.320]  having nothing to hide from the sun it it'll wake you up unless you want to get up at six a.m. or you know what do you have against roosters
[01:11:11.320 --> 01:11:17.320]  nothing but i don't want to wake me up and it kind of becomes this thing of why not put all the belongings you have on facebook
[01:11:17.320 --> 01:11:26.320]  so robbers can rob you if you don't you have something to hide so what's the bottom line on all this
[01:11:26.320 --> 01:11:34.320]  thanks for having me alex you bet you bet um so the bottom line is tour puts you the user in control of your data
[01:11:34.320 --> 01:11:41.320]  that we help you and not we make you anonymous by default will encrypt your traffic as you go through the tour network
[01:11:41.320 --> 01:11:49.320]  and whenever you show up to any site you want to visit your anonymous and then it's up to you to control what information you give them
[01:11:49.320 --> 01:11:58.320]  and how much you give them now that will at least stop microsoft google apple and amazon and others right from tracking everything you do
[01:11:58.320 --> 01:12:05.320]  because from what i've read they're just as bad as the nsa
[01:12:05.320 --> 01:12:11.320]  collaborating with nsa whether through legal threats or just wanting to be with the inside boys yes
[01:12:11.320 --> 01:12:15.320]  so i mean how secure is tour
[01:12:15.320 --> 01:12:21.320]  it's a fine question um how secure it means there's some sort of quantitative measure or something
[01:12:21.320 --> 01:12:26.320]  we have worked with people who use tour and life and death situations and they're still alive
[01:12:26.320 --> 01:12:33.320]  so we believe that tour is fairly secure fairly anonymous and probably one of your best options out there
[01:12:33.320 --> 01:12:39.320]  break down how it works for people because i guess you're part of one of the developers of it
[01:12:39.320 --> 01:12:47.320]  so tour is you download tour browser go to tourproject.org or you get however you get your software from wherever
[01:12:47.320 --> 01:12:55.320]  go to tour browser start it up and what it does is behind the scenes it connects to a series of three relays around the world
[01:12:55.320 --> 01:13:02.320]  so we're sitting here say we're here in boston my first relay could be in japan my second relay can be in argentina
[01:13:02.320 --> 01:13:08.320]  my third relay could be in sweden so then i go browse to you know whatever info wars dot com
[01:13:08.320 --> 01:13:14.320]  um as far as info wars knows i came from sweden they have no idea that i'm sitting here in boston
[01:13:14.320 --> 01:13:23.320]  and you would have to track my traffic around the world to see who i am and where i where i exist in the world
[01:13:23.320 --> 01:13:28.320]  what percentage of people do you think out there are using stuff like tour
[01:13:28.320 --> 01:13:37.320]  uh unfortunately a small percentage um we've had 150 million downloads of the software in the past year since the snowden
[01:13:37.320 --> 01:13:45.320]  revelations over the past you know since last summer um and that's still tiny compared to three billion people online
[01:13:45.320 --> 01:13:52.320]  however people are beginning to notice it people are beginning to realize you know what's privacy what is the NSA doing
[01:13:52.320 --> 01:14:03.320]  what is gchq doing um and how can i protect myself at any level even if it's just from you know some creep in a coffee shop sniffing the wi-fi
[01:14:03.320 --> 01:14:09.320]  well that's another reason to protect your data because there's thieves and bad hackers out there right
[01:14:09.320 --> 01:14:17.320]  right and in some cases it may be your internet service provider um there have we've gotten messages from all of the world
[01:14:17.320 --> 01:14:25.320]  that have sent us screenshots of ads on apple.com or google.com and if you look at them they're these big huge ugly banner ads
[01:14:25.320 --> 01:14:33.320]  um that neither apple nor google actually put on their home pages and that's because the internet service provider is watching traffic
[01:14:33.320 --> 01:14:42.320]  and injecting the ads into their traffic as they're you know doing their things online um so encrypting traffic using tours one way to stop that
[01:14:42.320 --> 01:14:50.320]  and the other you know simple thing you travel you go to hotel you trust everyone at the hotel with all your traffic all your personal details
[01:14:50.320 --> 01:14:59.320]  your chats your pictures everything your passcodes yep exactly um and there are plenty of companies out there who would love to get your email address
[01:14:59.320 --> 01:15:05.320]  whether you gave it to them or not and then you know sign you up for all sorts of lists and you go from there
[01:15:05.320 --> 01:15:14.320]  well if government and industry from the beginning had promoted security and a free system a free state we wouldn't be having this disaster
[01:15:14.320 --> 01:15:25.320]  I'm no tech guru like you but I just see nothing but a house of horrors coming in the future as spying is ubiquitous everything's got backdoors
[01:15:25.320 --> 01:15:33.320]  uh the young people just are wide open with their info uh it's being exploited by governments corporations and grassroots criminals
[01:15:33.320 --> 01:15:43.320]  uh it's just why do you think governments in the system or maybe you disagree have promoted I mean why are they promoting wi-fi instead of you know grounded cables
[01:15:43.320 --> 01:15:46.320]  why are they going with the system so wide open?
[01:15:46.320 --> 01:15:56.320]  uh in some degrees it's just about control that you know they people get into power and they want control over others and how do they do that
[01:15:56.320 --> 01:16:05.320]  well if they have an asymmetry of information where they have more information about you and they think they can predict you and they think they know everything about you
[01:16:05.320 --> 01:16:14.320]  while you know little about them um that's probably the core of the problem that more much more transparency and I know you're you mentioned whistleblowers earlier
[01:16:14.320 --> 01:16:22.320]  um we probably wouldn't be having this conversation unless Edward Snowden and you know I've spent time talking to William Binney face to face
[01:16:22.320 --> 01:16:34.320]  um and Drake and others and you know their their efforts to sort of force transparency on power structures has made people wake up and start realizing what's going on
[01:16:34.320 --> 01:16:45.320]  they are such heroes in fact I want to give you the floor because you're the expert on this get into the NSA get into uh the attack on whistleblowers bipartisan it means classical totalitarianism
[01:16:45.320 --> 01:16:54.320]  that's what Binney called to the guardian but I mean you've got the floor to talk to the audience about things you think are important instead of me just throwing questions out here
[01:16:54.320 --> 01:16:57.320]  you're happy to ask questions um
[01:16:57.320 --> 01:17:00.320]  what's most important for folks to know right now
[01:17:00.320 --> 01:17:10.320]  uh the internet is a network networks are designed to be recorded and watched everywhere at every single point um you know it's not just the
[01:17:10.320 --> 01:17:20.320]  the 1% of the tech people to sort of understand how networks work um as a former network engineer myself one of the things I was hired to do was to watch the network look for attacks
[01:17:20.320 --> 01:17:31.320]  figure out who's doing what um and it's truly easy if you control the network if you think of the internet as just a larger network which it is um it becomes easier
[01:17:31.320 --> 01:17:35.320]  you know with enough money you can do anything um I think
[01:17:35.320 --> 01:17:43.320]  what started to happen have been you know the the press has started to wake up to realize what the NSA and GCHQ
[01:17:43.320 --> 01:17:53.320]  and you know frankly we've heard that the FSB in Russia and the Chinese I think it's MSS are the equivalent agencies can do with the internet and watch everything
[01:17:53.320 --> 01:18:04.320]  um what the results in is that journalists used to have to go to court and get you know subpoenaed get hauled in the court to say give us your sources we want to know who leaked a date about whatever
[01:18:04.320 --> 01:18:12.320]  now the government will still do that just to harass them but at the same time says we actually have all your data because we've been spying on you for years
[01:18:12.320 --> 01:18:25.320]  we know who your source is um and we've already taken care of them you know however we think necessary and most of the western world that's the fine chilling effect
[01:18:25.320 --> 01:18:39.320]  but we've worked with journalists who are working against corrupt intelligence agencies far more corrupt than the NSA um who are in with human trafficking cartels drug cartels this is how they fund themselves
[01:18:39.320 --> 01:18:40.320]  that's right
[01:18:40.320 --> 01:18:49.320]  and you know I I won't name a specific region but you know there are plenty of regions where you can imagine that human trafficking and drug cartels rule the government
[01:18:49.320 --> 01:18:53.320]  Mexico Middle East Central Asia
[01:18:53.320 --> 01:19:00.320]  sure so uh journalists in that situation you know wind up dead
[01:19:00.320 --> 01:19:14.320]  and those that don't know our government hands that over to Jordan or to Pakistan or to whoever I mean this is this is beyond the lives of others and other examples of East German Stasi this is so evil
[01:19:14.320 --> 01:19:19.320]  and it's being done for political control they're not even using this illegally quote on bad guys
[01:19:19.320 --> 01:19:24.320]  they are using it against journalists I mean as you know they tried to put William Benny in jail
[01:19:24.320 --> 01:19:41.320]  mm-hmm yeah and you know and Drake um I've talked to them both and they're both have told me you know the the nightmares they live through um and what they're you know their sort of attitude is funny because their attitude has been that you know I just don't use computers anymore
[01:19:41.320 --> 01:19:44.320]  because there's nothing safe I can do on them
[01:19:44.320 --> 01:19:58.320]  well yeah they'll just use the computers to set you up that's all another issue with these being two way is you can't believe anything and then with parallel construction sneaking peaks I mean the entire judiciary system in my view is illegitimate now we'll be right back

[01:33:16.320 --> 01:33:22.320]  Dow Jones is only down 226 points now bouncing back 25 points or so
[01:33:22.320 --> 01:33:28.320]  the whole thing is a giant tower of babble with over-inflated dollars
[01:33:28.320 --> 01:33:29.320]  driving it upwards
[01:33:29.320 --> 01:33:32.320]  stock market's not up ladies and gentlemen in the last decade
[01:33:32.320 --> 01:33:34.320]  technically it is but not in reality
[01:33:34.320 --> 01:33:37.320]  the dollar has been devalued
[01:33:37.320 --> 01:33:41.320]  I mean I'll get a couple bagels with cheese and egg on them
[01:33:41.320 --> 01:33:45.320]  and a couple coffees and it's like $25
[01:33:45.320 --> 01:33:48.320]  just a year ago it'd be like 10 bucks
[01:33:48.320 --> 01:33:49.320]  and that was too much
[01:33:49.320 --> 01:33:53.320]  I mean inflation is just crazy right now
[01:33:53.320 --> 01:33:57.320]  and they're going no no no inflation's at 6% or 7%
[01:33:57.320 --> 01:33:59.320]  and that's considered high
[01:33:59.320 --> 01:34:02.320]  no it's more like I think they officially say it's like 3%
[01:34:02.320 --> 01:34:06.320]  they claim unemployment's like 8% it's more like 22%
[01:34:06.320 --> 01:34:09.320]  shadow stats has all that
[01:34:09.320 --> 01:34:11.320]  all they use at shadow stats with John Williams
[01:34:11.320 --> 01:34:15.320]  is the same system they used up until Reagan left office
[01:34:15.320 --> 01:34:17.320]  they used for decades before that
[01:34:17.320 --> 01:34:19.320]  to calculate unemployment and inflation
[01:34:19.320 --> 01:34:21.320]  but enough of that I'm already digressing
[01:34:21.320 --> 01:34:23.320]  some good news here
[01:34:23.320 --> 01:34:25.320]  some very good news
[01:34:25.320 --> 01:34:28.320]  Attorney General Eric Holder
[01:34:28.320 --> 01:34:31.320]  the Washington Times is reporting
[01:34:31.320 --> 01:34:35.320]  that the contempt of Congress case against him will continue
[01:34:35.320 --> 01:34:37.320]  remember when he used to threaten members of Congress
[01:34:37.320 --> 01:34:38.320]  just six months ago
[01:34:38.320 --> 01:34:40.320]  so you better watch it
[01:34:40.320 --> 01:34:43.320]  a federal judge earlier this week ruled that the Justice Department
[01:34:43.320 --> 01:34:46.320]  will have to begin submitting documents next month
[01:34:46.320 --> 01:34:49.320]  oh it turns out Lois Lerner did destroy the emails
[01:34:49.320 --> 01:34:52.320]  and they were actually saved remember all that
[01:34:52.320 --> 01:34:55.320]  will have to start submitting documents next month
[01:34:55.320 --> 01:34:57.320]  related to the botched it wasn't botched
[01:34:57.320 --> 01:34:59.320]  it was botched because it got found out
[01:34:59.320 --> 01:35:02.320]  fast and furious gun operation in a case brought
[01:35:02.320 --> 01:35:04.320]  by Judicial Watch
[01:35:04.320 --> 01:35:07.320]  Judicial Watch just says so much good bipartisan work
[01:35:07.320 --> 01:35:10.320]  I know they're more conservative but they go out to Republicans too
[01:35:10.320 --> 01:35:13.320]  I'm not part of Judicial Watch I'm just saying they are really awesome
[01:35:13.320 --> 01:35:16.320]  I don't think it's any coincidence
[01:35:16.320 --> 01:35:20.320]  he's resigning as the courts are ruling that fast and furious information
[01:35:20.320 --> 01:35:23.320]  has to be released said Fenton
[01:35:23.320 --> 01:35:25.320]  to the Washington Times
[01:35:25.320 --> 01:35:28.320]  we've had Fenton on before we need to get him back on
[01:35:28.320 --> 01:35:32.320]  the Justice Department turned over documents related to the operation
[01:35:32.320 --> 01:35:35.320]  but has refused to release documents showing
[01:35:35.320 --> 01:35:39.320]  the department's own handling after a top official sent a letter
[01:35:39.320 --> 01:35:42.320]  saying agents never knowingly allowed guns to walk
[01:35:42.320 --> 01:35:45.320]  even though we have all the witnesses that they were ordered to do that
[01:35:45.320 --> 01:35:49.320]  the department later had to officially retract that claim
[01:35:49.320 --> 01:35:52.320]  the Obama administration said it would not prosecute Mr. Holder
[01:35:52.320 --> 01:35:54.320]  because he runs it
[01:35:54.320 --> 01:35:58.320]  because of a long-standing policy that it not pursue contempt cases
[01:35:58.320 --> 01:36:02.320]  against individuals in the White House has made a claim of executive privilege
[01:36:02.320 --> 01:36:05.320]  the dirty secret was Obama swooped in
[01:36:05.320 --> 01:36:08.320]  and in an unprecedented way asserted
[01:36:08.320 --> 01:36:11.320]  executive privilege over the documents
[01:36:11.320 --> 01:36:16.320]  which the Justice Department uses an excuse to not prosecute him
[01:36:16.320 --> 01:36:18.320]  what an oxymoron
[01:36:18.320 --> 01:36:21.320]  we can't prosecute ourselves because we can't prosecute
[01:36:21.320 --> 01:36:24.320]  after he leaves office the fight over the documents will continue
[01:36:24.320 --> 01:36:29.320]  but Mr. Holder himself is likely to be safe from any fallout
[01:36:29.320 --> 01:36:31.320]  analysts said
[01:36:31.320 --> 01:36:33.320]  well yeah because the system is so corrupt
[01:36:33.320 --> 01:36:37.320]  they'd rather go harass innocent people all day
[01:36:37.320 --> 01:36:39.320]  all the borders wide open
[01:36:39.320 --> 01:36:42.320]  and go to your phone calls, thanks for holding Brian
[01:36:42.320 --> 01:36:44.320]  I thought the guest was at the bottom of the hour

[01:36:46.320 --> 01:36:48.320]  so that's why everybody had to hold

[01:36:53.320 --> 01:36:55.320]  yeah, your phone's breaking up a little bit
[01:36:55.320 --> 01:36:57.320]  try to talk right in it for me
[01:36:57.320 --> 01:36:58.320]  alright
[01:36:58.320 --> 01:37:00.320]  so
[01:37:00.320 --> 01:37:03.320]  I mean, I think the stock market's worse
[01:37:03.320 --> 01:37:05.320]  because you can indict Holder
[01:37:05.320 --> 01:37:07.320]  you can arrest him
[01:37:07.320 --> 01:37:09.320]  the stock market can't be stopped
[01:37:09.320 --> 01:37:11.320]  once that starts it's over
[01:37:11.320 --> 01:37:14.320]  that's right, and when it's fiat run
[01:37:14.320 --> 01:37:18.320]  it can just balloon and balloon until it pops on its own potentially
[01:37:18.320 --> 01:37:21.320]  or perhaps it's so regular it'll never pop
[01:37:21.320 --> 01:37:26.320]  still, as the real economy dies due to over-regulation and inflation
[01:37:26.320 --> 01:37:29.320]  all that's left is this fiat monster
[01:37:29.320 --> 01:37:32.320]  but then the inflation inherent in it
[01:37:32.320 --> 01:37:34.320]  will start manifesting in the economy
[01:37:34.320 --> 01:37:37.320]  what's your gut tell you or just your everyday
[01:37:37.320 --> 01:37:38.320]  dead reckoning?
[01:37:38.320 --> 01:37:40.320]  how bad is inflation in California?
[01:37:40.320 --> 01:37:42.320]  because it's off the chart
[01:37:42.320 --> 01:37:44.320]  in Texas and other areas
[01:37:44.320 --> 01:37:46.320]  I haven't been to California in a few years
[01:37:46.320 --> 01:37:48.320]  I live in San Jose
[01:37:48.320 --> 01:37:49.320]  I live in the Silicon Valley
[01:37:49.320 --> 01:37:51.320]  the inflation is ridiculous
[01:37:51.320 --> 01:37:54.320]  $2,800 for a few bedroom apartment here
[01:37:54.320 --> 01:37:57.320]  nobody can afford the houses
[01:37:57.320 --> 01:38:00.320]  every third shop is closed
[01:38:00.320 --> 01:38:02.320]  it's getting bad and this is
[01:38:02.320 --> 01:38:04.320]  the third biggest economy in the world
[01:38:04.320 --> 01:38:08.320]  Silicon Valley and it's that bad here
[01:38:08.320 --> 01:38:10.320]  you're the supposed engine in California
[01:38:10.320 --> 01:38:14.320]  that in farming and they're cutting the water off of the farmers
[01:38:14.320 --> 01:38:17.320]  for invasive species fish
[01:38:17.320 --> 01:38:21.320]  they are harassing everybody with more regulations and bureaucracy
[01:38:21.320 --> 01:38:24.320]  running everybody out of the state who actually wants to open a business
[01:38:24.320 --> 01:38:26.320]  or keep a business there
[01:38:26.320 --> 01:38:30.320]  and the jobs are going to China and India
[01:38:30.320 --> 01:38:33.320]  but it's so low paying there
[01:38:33.320 --> 01:38:36.320]  they've got studies showing it's not even helping the Chinese
[01:38:36.320 --> 01:38:39.320]  or the Indians
[01:38:39.320 --> 01:38:42.320]  I mean right, you know, I mean you got NASA and GATT
[01:38:42.320 --> 01:38:45.320]  and all these new trade things that are basically going to
[01:38:45.320 --> 01:38:47.320]  go ahead and de-industrialize the rest of the nation
[01:38:47.320 --> 01:38:49.320]  and once you de-industrialize that's it
[01:38:49.320 --> 01:38:51.320]  and that's what MIT said this year
[01:38:51.320 --> 01:38:53.320]  they said, oh my gosh
[01:38:53.320 --> 01:38:55.320]  we've sent all our secrets overseas
[01:38:55.320 --> 01:38:57.320]  we can't get it back
[01:38:57.320 --> 01:38:59.320]  well I thought we were going to be super high tech in service
[01:38:59.320 --> 01:39:01.320]  and all those factory jobs
[01:39:01.320 --> 01:39:03.320]  and all we don't need that
[01:39:03.320 --> 01:39:06.320]  why our young people can learn to flip burgers
[01:39:06.320 --> 01:39:09.320]  and now they're closing McDonald's all across the country
[01:39:09.320 --> 01:39:12.320]  now the service economy is contracting
[01:39:12.320 --> 01:39:14.320]  and if you've got a corporate job or a government job
[01:39:14.320 --> 01:39:16.320]  or some kind of stock market related job
[01:39:16.320 --> 01:39:18.320]  you're okay for now
[01:39:18.320 --> 01:39:21.320]  but the numbers all show it going down, down, down
[01:39:21.320 --> 01:39:23.320]  as the baby boomers retire
[01:39:23.320 --> 01:39:26.320]  and right on time, I appreciate your call
[01:39:26.320 --> 01:39:28.320]  Brian, great points
[01:39:28.320 --> 01:39:30.320]  right on time they're going you know what
[01:39:30.320 --> 01:39:32.320]  we need to kill old people
[01:39:32.320 --> 01:39:34.320]  we need to have death panels
[01:39:34.320 --> 01:39:36.320]  you bet we're not going to take care of you
[01:39:36.320 --> 01:39:38.320]  you're lazy, you work your whole life
[01:39:38.320 --> 01:39:40.320]  we're going to take those pension funds over to protect them
[01:39:40.320 --> 01:39:42.320]  let me give you a news flash
[01:39:42.320 --> 01:39:44.320]  you're not going to get your government pension
[01:39:44.320 --> 01:39:46.320]  you're not going to get your state pension
[01:39:46.320 --> 01:39:48.320]  you're not going to get most of it
[01:39:48.320 --> 01:39:50.320]  they're going to take it over and federalize it to keep it safe
[01:39:50.320 --> 01:39:52.320]  during the stock market crash
[01:39:52.320 --> 01:39:54.320]  and then they'll take 30-40% of it
[01:39:54.320 --> 01:39:56.320]  and they'll take another 30-40% inflation
[01:39:56.320 --> 01:39:58.320]  and if you get it, it'll be a pittance
[01:39:58.320 --> 01:40:00.320]  of what you had before
[01:40:00.320 --> 01:40:02.320]  all these people say, Alex, I'm going with the system
[01:40:02.320 --> 01:40:04.320]  even though it's corrupt, we got to prop it up
[01:40:04.320 --> 01:40:08.320]  the system is designed to implode
[01:40:08.320 --> 01:40:10.320]  people should get their pension funds
[01:40:10.320 --> 01:40:12.320]  because in the aggregate
[01:40:12.320 --> 01:40:14.320]  even though some of them are overblown and fiat
[01:40:14.320 --> 01:40:16.320]  most of the taxes aren't going to pay for those
[01:40:16.320 --> 01:40:18.320]  public and private stuff
[01:40:18.320 --> 01:40:20.320]  it's going signed on to derivatives
[01:40:20.320 --> 01:40:22.320]  see, the globalists want us artificially poor
[01:40:22.320 --> 01:40:24.320]  so they create this black hole of derivatives
[01:40:24.320 --> 01:40:26.320]  and then feed all the extra money into that
[01:40:26.320 --> 01:40:28.320]  every time the economy starts racing
[01:40:28.320 --> 01:40:30.320]  they up taxes to quote
[01:40:30.320 --> 01:40:32.320]  cool it down
[01:40:32.320 --> 01:40:34.320]  you know that term the fellow reserve
[01:40:34.320 --> 01:40:36.320]  I would use, Bernanke would use
[01:40:36.320 --> 01:40:38.320]  but the guy that really used it was Greenspan
[01:40:38.320 --> 01:40:40.320]  oh, we're growing at 5%
[01:40:40.320 --> 01:40:42.320]  it'll overheat
[01:40:42.320 --> 01:40:44.320]  let's turn it down
[01:40:44.320 --> 01:40:46.320]  overheating economy
[01:40:46.320 --> 01:40:48.320]  is 15 points
[01:40:48.320 --> 01:40:50.320]  if you go back 100 years ago
[01:40:50.320 --> 01:40:52.320]  they saw that as economy growing dangerously fast
[01:40:52.320 --> 01:40:54.320]  15% a year
[01:40:54.320 --> 01:40:56.320]  10% was our average until 1913
[01:40:56.320 --> 01:40:58.320]  you're either growing
[01:40:58.320 --> 01:41:00.320]  or you're dying
[01:41:00.320 --> 01:41:02.320]  let's go back to the phone calls, Tim in Virginia
[01:41:02.320 --> 01:41:04.320]  thanks for calling, go ahead
[01:41:04.320 --> 01:41:06.320]  hi, how are you doing?
[01:41:06.320 --> 01:41:08.320]  good brother
[01:41:08.320 --> 01:41:10.320]  it's an honor to talk to you Alex
[01:41:10.320 --> 01:41:12.320]  we listened to your show for like three years
[01:41:12.320 --> 01:41:14.320]  and I just wanted to run a little idea
[01:41:14.320 --> 01:41:16.320]  conjured up over the past
[01:41:16.320 --> 01:41:18.320]  9-11 anniversary
[01:41:18.320 --> 01:41:20.320]  just popped into my head
[01:41:20.320 --> 01:41:22.320]  what would I do
[01:41:22.320 --> 01:41:24.320]  what would the American people do
[01:41:24.320 --> 01:41:26.320]  that truly care about this country do
[01:41:26.320 --> 01:41:28.320]  if another situation like that happened
[01:41:28.320 --> 01:41:30.320]  I'm from York, Pennsylvania
[01:41:30.320 --> 01:41:32.320]  this was like four hours away
[01:41:32.320 --> 01:41:34.320]  I just like to think that I would just hop in my car
[01:41:34.320 --> 01:41:36.320]  and run right up to say
[01:41:36.320 --> 01:41:38.320]  the same situation
[01:41:38.320 --> 01:41:40.320]  I was only 15 years old when it happened
[01:41:40.320 --> 01:41:42.320]  and it's like something I wanted to run by
[01:41:42.320 --> 01:41:44.320]  and get your thoughts on
[01:41:44.320 --> 01:41:46.320]  sure, your radio's echoing a little bit
[01:41:46.320 --> 01:41:48.320]  are you saying what will happen when there's another 9-11?
[01:41:48.320 --> 01:41:50.320]  no
[01:41:50.320 --> 01:41:52.320]  I'm saying
[01:41:52.320 --> 01:41:54.320]  what would somebody do
[01:41:54.320 --> 01:41:56.320]  like yourself or me, somebody that really cares
[01:41:56.320 --> 01:41:58.320]  about this country do
[01:41:58.320 --> 01:42:00.320]  and I'm saying I would jump right in my car
[01:42:00.320 --> 01:42:02.320]  run up to healthy people
[01:42:04.320 --> 01:42:06.320]  help them if what?
[01:42:06.320 --> 01:42:08.320]  if another situation
[01:42:08.320 --> 01:42:10.320]  had a false flag situation
[01:42:10.320 --> 01:42:12.320]  would happen, work to happen
[01:42:12.320 --> 01:42:14.320]  well that's one reason they don't want to
[01:42:14.320 --> 01:42:16.320]  stage big open false flags
[01:42:16.320 --> 01:42:18.320]  and would rather let real al Qaeda in
[01:42:18.320 --> 01:42:20.320]  under the name ISIS
[01:42:20.320 --> 01:42:22.320]  or any of these new names they're giving them
[01:42:22.320 --> 01:42:24.320]  IS, ISL
[01:42:24.320 --> 01:42:26.320]  there's just a whole bunch of them
[01:42:26.320 --> 01:42:28.320]  they're actually trying to wind up
[01:42:28.320 --> 01:42:30.320]  they call it a wind up toy
[01:42:30.320 --> 01:42:32.320]  real terrorist
[01:42:32.320 --> 01:42:34.320]  so they don't get caught staging another fast and furious
[01:42:34.320 --> 01:42:36.320]  or another sandy hook
[01:42:36.320 --> 01:42:38.320]  Boston bombing
[01:42:38.320 --> 01:42:40.320]  they got caught with their pants down
[01:42:40.320 --> 01:42:42.320]  so over and over again it's the same story now
[01:42:42.320 --> 01:42:44.320]  and they get all the cops under
[01:42:44.320 --> 01:42:46.320]  peer pressure in their armored vehicles
[01:42:46.320 --> 01:42:48.320]  wound up let's go find the others aren't have brother
[01:42:48.320 --> 01:42:50.320]  let's shoot him up in the boat so there's no witnesses
[01:42:50.320 --> 01:42:52.320]  you know kill them traitors
[01:42:52.320 --> 01:42:54.320]  kill them just like they burned up
[01:42:54.320 --> 01:42:56.320]  Dorner out in California
[01:42:56.320 --> 01:42:58.320]  and I get
[01:42:58.320 --> 01:43:00.320]  from their perspective why they burned him up
[01:43:00.320 --> 01:43:02.320]  he probably would have sat on death row for 30 years
[01:43:02.320 --> 01:43:04.320]  but don't sit there and say on tape we're gonna burn
[01:43:04.320 --> 01:43:06.320]  him up and then lie and say they didn't burn him up
[01:43:06.320 --> 01:43:08.320]  I mean it just
[01:43:08.320 --> 01:43:10.320]  who knows though then if Dorner really did it
[01:43:10.320 --> 01:43:12.320]  sure the cops had burned him up thought they were killing
[01:43:12.320 --> 01:43:14.320]  the cop killer but who knows anymore
[01:43:14.320 --> 01:43:16.320]  I mean that's the thing
[01:43:16.320 --> 01:43:18.320]  is that you really can't believe any of this we had
[01:43:18.320 --> 01:43:20.320]  Haskell and his wife
[01:43:20.320 --> 01:43:22.320]  both lawyers
[01:43:22.320 --> 01:43:24.320]  heard Haskell on the plane
[01:43:24.320 --> 01:43:26.320]  was it five Christmases
[01:43:26.320 --> 01:43:28.320]  ago the underwear bomber four Christmases ago
[01:43:28.320 --> 01:43:30.320]  I forget was it four or five
[01:43:30.320 --> 01:43:32.320]  right as they roll out the naked
[01:43:32.320 --> 01:43:34.320]  body scanners the week before
[01:43:34.320 --> 01:43:36.320]  this drugged up guy gets put on the plane
[01:43:36.320 --> 01:43:38.320]  a firecracker goes off in his underwear
[01:43:38.320 --> 01:43:40.320]  and
[01:43:40.320 --> 01:43:42.320]  it's supposedly
[01:43:42.320 --> 01:43:44.320]  the end of the world yeah it was back in 2012
[01:43:47.320 --> 01:43:49.320]  now it was more than that
[01:43:49.320 --> 01:43:51.320]  it was more than two years ago guys
[01:43:51.320 --> 01:43:53.320]  that's just Kurt Haskell going public exposing it
[01:43:53.320 --> 01:43:55.320]  in the trial but listen let's just digress
[01:43:55.320 --> 01:43:57.320]  you can look up underwear bombing it'll give you the date I forget
[01:43:57.320 --> 01:43:59.320]  2010
[01:43:59.320 --> 01:44:01.320]  yeah but we'll look it up
[01:44:01.320 --> 01:44:03.320]  are you on air when you're talking to the mic
[01:44:04.320 --> 01:44:06.320]  no sorry I was just whispering in your ear
[01:44:06.320 --> 01:44:08.320]  I really want you to do I really know you're doing a great job
[01:44:08.320 --> 01:44:10.320]  it's just that you make a lot of good points
[01:44:10.320 --> 01:44:12.320]  CJ and so that's why
[01:44:12.320 --> 01:44:14.320]  when you can I want you to be on the air
[01:44:14.320 --> 01:44:16.320]  yes I know it's a weird habit to break
[01:44:16.320 --> 01:44:18.320]  nobody ever being on air in there
[01:44:18.320 --> 01:44:20.320]  by the way are we putting Mike's in in the new studio
[01:44:20.320 --> 01:44:22.320]  yeah so the control room can talk
[01:44:22.320 --> 01:44:24.320]  we'll have a round table
[01:44:24.320 --> 01:44:26.320]  I think we're going to have some shows to break folks in
[01:44:26.320 --> 01:44:28.320]  where the whole show is a bunch of the crew
[01:44:28.320 --> 01:44:30.320]  and we have discussions as guests just to get everybody
[01:44:30.320 --> 01:44:32.320]  used to it because I think that's what's going to happen
[01:44:32.320 --> 01:44:34.320]  we've got to
[01:44:34.320 --> 01:44:36.320]  get you guys baptized by fire
[01:44:36.320 --> 01:44:38.320]  they have another word for it
[01:44:38.320 --> 01:44:40.320]  but I'm not going to say it on air
[01:44:40.320 --> 01:44:42.320]  but
[01:44:42.320 --> 01:44:44.320]  someday CJ you'll be on air so much
[01:44:44.320 --> 01:44:46.320]  that you actually almost start falling asleep
[01:44:46.320 --> 01:44:48.320]  while you're ranting
[01:44:48.320 --> 01:44:50.320]  like I am right now
[01:44:50.320 --> 01:44:52.320]  just like lay down right here
[01:44:52.320 --> 01:44:54.320]  kind of relax it's not that the show is boring or anything
[01:44:54.320 --> 01:44:56.320]  it's just that
[01:44:56.320 --> 01:44:58.320]  some days I get in here and the topics are so heavy
[01:44:58.320 --> 01:45:00.320]  that I almost feel like I'm in a trance
[01:45:00.320 --> 01:45:02.320]  it's just really weird
[01:45:02.320 --> 01:45:04.320]  and today is one of those days
[01:45:04.320 --> 01:45:06.320]  I had seven hours sleep last night
[01:45:06.320 --> 01:45:08.320]  I don't know what's going on
[01:45:08.320 --> 01:45:10.320]  I was so hyper yesh came in my head spin
[01:45:10.320 --> 01:45:12.320]  but today go ahead CJ
[01:45:12.320 --> 01:45:14.320]  it was in 2009
[01:45:14.320 --> 01:45:16.320]  I was in 2009 thank you for fact checking that
[01:45:16.320 --> 01:45:18.320]  my memory is great sometimes
[01:45:18.320 --> 01:45:20.320]  sometimes I can't remember
[01:45:20.320 --> 01:45:22.320]  so I said five years ago I was correct
[01:45:22.320 --> 01:45:24.320]  there we go my P-brain was accurate
[01:45:24.320 --> 01:45:26.320]  yet again
[01:45:26.320 --> 01:45:28.320]  all right
[01:45:28.320 --> 01:45:30.320]  I want to continue with your calls
[01:45:30.320 --> 01:45:32.320]  on the plane
[01:45:32.320 --> 01:45:34.320]  and he sees the whole thing staged there's a guy
[01:45:34.320 --> 01:45:36.320]  for the last hour of the flight just sitting there
[01:45:36.320 --> 01:45:38.320]  two seats behind Mutalib the puppet
[01:45:38.320 --> 01:45:40.320]  they put a fake video out of him everything
[01:45:40.320 --> 01:45:42.320]  videotaping him
[01:45:42.320 --> 01:45:44.320]  then they get them all off the plane
[01:45:44.320 --> 01:45:46.320]  tell everybody to shut up about what they saw
[01:45:46.320 --> 01:45:48.320]  I mean the whole thing was staged
[01:45:48.320 --> 01:45:50.320]  and then he said that he saw a sharp dressed man
[01:45:50.320 --> 01:45:52.320]  get Mutalib on the plane
[01:45:52.320 --> 01:45:54.320]  without an ID
[01:45:54.320 --> 01:45:56.320]  passport anything without a visa
[01:45:56.320 --> 01:45:58.320]  and it turned out it was
[01:45:58.320 --> 01:46:00.320]  an unnamed US federal agency
[01:46:00.320 --> 01:46:02.320]  slash FBI liaison
[01:46:02.320 --> 01:46:04.320]  CIA liaison
[01:46:04.320 --> 01:46:06.320]  both agency names came up but
[01:46:06.320 --> 01:46:08.320]  let him on the plane international security
[01:46:08.320 --> 01:46:10.320]  and they followed his orders and put him on the plane
[01:46:10.320 --> 01:46:12.320]  for the underwear bombing
[01:46:12.320 --> 01:46:14.320]  they put a drugged up Patsy on the plane
[01:46:14.320 --> 01:46:16.320]  the son of an ambassador
[01:46:16.320 --> 01:46:18.320]  and if you don't know that stage
[01:46:18.320 --> 01:46:20.320]  well I got you know
[01:46:20.320 --> 01:46:22.320]  a bridge I'm willing to sell you in Brooklyn
[01:46:22.320 --> 01:46:24.320]  now it's mine and I own it
[01:46:24.320 --> 01:46:26.320]  and if you'll buy that I'll throw the Golden Gate
[01:46:26.320 --> 01:46:28.320]  in free to quote George straight
[01:46:28.320 --> 01:46:30.320]  maybe next
[01:46:30.320 --> 01:46:32.320]  we can come in with Amarillo by morning
[01:46:32.320 --> 01:46:34.320]  I think that is the best
[01:46:34.320 --> 01:46:36.320]  we can have a whole radio show
[01:46:36.320 --> 01:46:38.320]  Oceanfront property
[01:46:38.320 --> 01:46:40.320]  I got some Oceanfront property in Arizona
[01:46:40.320 --> 01:46:42.320]  and from my front porch you can see the sea
[01:46:42.320 --> 01:46:44.320]  and if you'll buy that
[01:46:44.320 --> 01:46:46.320]  I'll throw the Golden Gate in free
[01:46:46.320 --> 01:46:48.320]  I just love George straight
[01:46:50.320 --> 01:46:52.320]  let's go listen to George straight
[01:46:52.320 --> 01:46:54.320]  instead of worrying about the New World Order
[01:46:54.320 --> 01:46:56.320]  I mean I'm sick of the government being so evil
[01:46:56.320 --> 01:46:58.320]  I'm sick of it being so bad
[01:46:58.320 --> 01:47:00.320]  I'm sick of
[01:47:00.320 --> 01:47:02.320]  so much stuff being totally staged
[01:47:02.320 --> 01:47:04.320]  it's just really scary
[01:47:04.320 --> 01:47:06.320]  but what's more scary is not admitting it
[01:47:06.320 --> 01:47:08.320]  and do something about it
[01:47:08.320 --> 01:47:10.320]  Josh in Georgia you're on the air go ahead
[01:47:10.320 --> 01:47:12.320]  Alex can you hear me?
[01:47:12.320 --> 01:47:14.320]  Yes sir thanks for holding
[01:47:14.320 --> 01:47:16.320]  Yes thank you for having me
[01:47:16.320 --> 01:47:18.320]  first time caller long time listener
[01:47:18.320 --> 01:47:20.320]  and I wanted to bring up two things
[01:47:20.320 --> 01:47:22.320]  first off with Eric Holder
[01:47:22.320 --> 01:47:24.320]  I'm just because there is so much junk against him
[01:47:24.320 --> 01:47:26.320]  and the way that people view
[01:47:26.320 --> 01:47:28.320]  him now
[01:47:28.320 --> 01:47:30.320]  he's just not viewed as that Obama
[01:47:30.320 --> 01:47:32.320]  savior as when Obama ran in
[01:47:32.320 --> 01:47:34.320]  2008 and what they're going to do
[01:47:34.320 --> 01:47:36.320]  is what I believe replace him
[01:47:36.320 --> 01:47:38.320]  with somebody who is going
[01:47:38.320 --> 01:47:40.320]  to fulfill the things that
[01:47:40.320 --> 01:47:42.320]  he's not going to be able to fulfill
[01:47:42.320 --> 01:47:44.320]  just because of how he's viewed and how people
[01:47:44.320 --> 01:47:46.320]  look at him now. You think it'll be a woman just to play
[01:47:46.320 --> 01:47:48.320]  that stun up for becoming of Hillary
[01:47:48.320 --> 01:47:50.320]  our savior?
[01:47:50.320 --> 01:47:52.320]  That is very possible
[01:47:52.320 --> 01:47:54.320]  now the next thing
[01:47:54.320 --> 01:47:56.320]  I wanted to bring up to you
[01:47:56.320 --> 01:47:58.320]  was something that was signed into law
[01:47:58.320 --> 01:48:00.320]  and just swept under the news
[01:48:00.320 --> 01:48:02.320]  but it's affecting us
[01:48:02.320 --> 01:48:04.320]  everywhere. It's
[01:48:04.320 --> 01:48:06.320]  the Dodd-Frank law
[01:48:06.320 --> 01:48:08.320]  I've been a mortgage loan originator for five years
[01:48:08.320 --> 01:48:10.320]  and my company had to cease
[01:48:10.320 --> 01:48:12.320]  and desist October 13th
[01:48:12.320 --> 01:48:14.320]  2013 because
[01:48:14.320 --> 01:48:16.320]  in one day 400
[01:48:16.320 --> 01:48:18.320]  new laws were implemented under the Dodd-Frank law
[01:48:18.320 --> 01:48:20.320]  and that caused our company
[01:48:20.320 --> 01:48:22.320]  to cease and desist. Now the fact is
[01:48:22.320 --> 01:48:24.320]  we were not breaking any laws
[01:48:24.320 --> 01:48:26.320]  but these new compliance laws that came into effect
[01:48:26.320 --> 01:48:28.320]  were written
[01:48:28.320 --> 01:48:30.320]  so strategically to our advertising
[01:48:30.320 --> 01:48:32.320]  to the way that we're able to do our business
[01:48:32.320 --> 01:48:34.320]  we had to cease and desist so that we wouldn't break
[01:48:34.320 --> 01:48:36.320]  any laws. So we have
[01:48:36.320 --> 01:48:38.320]  non-depository banks all around America
[01:48:38.320 --> 01:48:40.320]  they're going to be shutting down
[01:48:40.320 --> 01:48:42.320]  and it's going to be propping up these
[01:48:42.320 --> 01:48:44.320]  new these big banks
[01:48:44.320 --> 01:48:46.320]  these new regulations and that's what's
[01:48:46.320 --> 01:48:48.320]  going to take over
[01:48:48.320 --> 01:48:50.320]  is these new banking regulatory agencies
[01:48:50.320 --> 01:48:52.320]  when the local banks shut down
[01:48:52.320 --> 01:48:54.320]  we're going to be bound by the
[01:48:54.320 --> 01:48:56.320]  money changers.
[01:48:56.320 --> 01:48:58.320]  The head of the Texas Banking
[01:48:58.320 --> 01:49:00.320]  Association
[01:49:00.320 --> 01:49:02.320]  four years ago wrote a huge piece that I saw
[01:49:02.320 --> 01:49:04.320]  on the Austin Business Journal
[01:49:04.320 --> 01:49:06.320]  but it was syndicated through business journals all over the state
[01:49:06.320 --> 01:49:08.320]  and you'd have thought I had written it
[01:49:08.320 --> 01:49:10.320]  you would have thought that you
[01:49:10.320 --> 01:49:12.320]  had written it. I mean he said exactly that
[01:49:12.320 --> 01:49:14.320]  and I've read the regulations
[01:49:14.320 --> 01:49:16.320]  I looked at the synopsis it is meant
[01:49:16.320 --> 01:49:18.320]  to shut down credit unions small banks
[01:49:18.320 --> 01:49:20.320]  and red tape everybody
[01:49:20.320 --> 01:49:22.320]  and was literally written by JPMorgan Chase
[01:49:22.320 --> 01:49:24.320]  Bank of America
[01:49:24.320 --> 01:49:26.320]  Wells Fargo all the usual suspects
[01:49:26.320 --> 01:49:28.320]  and you're absolutely right
[01:49:28.320 --> 01:49:30.320]  and it is a
[01:49:30.320 --> 01:49:32.320]  a travesty
[01:49:32.320 --> 01:49:34.320]  that they've done this.
[01:49:34.320 --> 01:49:36.320]  Yeah, I agree
[01:49:36.320 --> 01:49:38.320]  and what we're going to see now
[01:49:38.320 --> 01:49:40.320]  the regulatory agencies
[01:49:40.320 --> 01:49:42.320]  all we see coming into place now
[01:49:42.320 --> 01:49:44.320]  are these lawmakers
[01:49:44.320 --> 01:49:46.320]  I've never heard so many
[01:49:46.320 --> 01:49:48.320]  news articles with new lawmakers coming up
[01:49:48.320 --> 01:49:50.320]  with new policies new regulations new laws
[01:49:50.320 --> 01:49:52.320]  I've never seen so many laws come into
[01:49:52.320 --> 01:49:54.320]  Yeah, they're the ones that wrote it all
[01:49:54.320 --> 01:49:56.320]  with the derivatives and the mega banks
[01:49:56.320 --> 01:49:58.320]  and giving poor people loans that couldn't pay it back
[01:49:58.320 --> 01:50:00.320]  and they're still doing
[01:50:00.320 --> 01:50:02.320]  all that they've increased the derivatives
[01:50:02.320 --> 01:50:04.320]  that's been in mainstream news
[01:50:04.320 --> 01:50:06.320]  they've accelerated it and they've used their fraud
[01:50:06.320 --> 01:50:08.320]  to get regulations in
[01:50:08.320 --> 01:50:10.320]  to only shut down their competition
[01:50:10.320 --> 01:50:12.320]  the local banks that are the lifeblood of any community
[01:50:12.320 --> 01:50:14.320]  while lobbying to stop the formation
[01:50:14.320 --> 01:50:16.320]  of state banks and things like that
[01:50:16.320 --> 01:50:18.320]  we need diversity in banking
[01:50:18.320 --> 01:50:20.320]  that's why it's important folks
[01:50:20.320 --> 01:50:22.320]  that if you've got an international business and you need a big mega bank
[01:50:22.320 --> 01:50:24.320]  fine have one but have your money
[01:50:24.320 --> 01:50:26.320]  in a local bank
[01:50:26.320 --> 01:50:28.320]  you usually get better service anyways
[01:50:28.320 --> 01:50:30.320]  I mean there are so many good local and regional banks
[01:50:30.320 --> 01:50:32.320]  and people
[01:50:32.320 --> 01:50:34.320]  don't bank with them they are
[01:50:34.320 --> 01:50:36.320]  insane they are crazy
[01:50:36.320 --> 01:50:38.320]  and if you don't try to
[01:50:38.320 --> 01:50:40.320]  go get your home mortgage with a smaller company
[01:50:40.320 --> 01:50:42.320]  I just think
[01:50:42.320 --> 01:50:44.320]  you're nuts it really comes down to that
[01:50:44.320 --> 01:50:46.320]  besides a big bank will end up buying
[01:50:46.320 --> 01:50:48.320]  your mortgage anyways so they end up winning in the end
[01:50:48.320 --> 01:50:50.320]  no matter what we do it seems

[01:52:56.720 --> 01:52:57.720]  from InfoWarsLife.
[01:52:57.720 --> 01:53:01.240]  Americans, prepare for financial ruin.
[01:53:01.240 --> 01:53:05.360]  That is what one of the world's richest men, Donald Trump, said just a few weeks ago.
[01:53:05.360 --> 01:53:06.840]  What are you doing to prepare?
[01:53:06.840 --> 01:53:10.040]  The problems that caused the last financial crisis were never fixed.
[01:53:10.040 --> 01:53:12.000]  In fact, they're even worse now.
[01:53:12.000 --> 01:53:17.840]  The total amount of debt in the U.S. has grown by more than 57% since September 2008.
[01:53:17.840 --> 01:53:22.600]  The two big to fail banks are much larger, and the massive derivatives bubble is spiraling
[01:53:22.600 --> 01:53:27.040]  so far out of control that the only thing left to do is watch the spectacular crash
[01:53:27.040 --> 01:53:29.360]  landing that is inevitably coming.
[01:53:29.360 --> 01:53:33.880]  If you're a baby boomer with retirement funds, it's time you consider exiting the Wall Street
[01:53:33.880 --> 01:53:37.800]  Casino and start a cash-flowing international business of your own.
[01:53:37.800 --> 01:53:41.720]  There may be ways to preserve your wealth, but history has shown that few things can
[01:53:41.720 --> 01:53:44.200]  grow your wealth like having your own business.
[01:53:44.200 --> 01:53:45.520]  The crash is coming.
[01:53:45.520 --> 01:53:48.040]  Take measures now to soften the landing.
[01:53:48.040 --> 01:54:03.440]  Go to BabyBoomerBackupPlan.com or call 888-507-8789, that's BabyBoomerBackupPlan.com.
[01:54:03.440 --> 01:54:09.040]  Waging war on corruption, Monday through Friday from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m.
[01:54:09.040 --> 01:54:13.760]  It's Info Wars Live with your host, George Strait.
[01:54:13.760 --> 01:54:27.800]  If you leave me, I won't miss you, and I won't ever take you back, girl, your memory, won't
[01:54:27.800 --> 01:54:41.320]  ever haunt me, because I don't love you, and I feel by that, I got some pushing property
[01:54:41.320 --> 01:54:44.320]  in Arizona.
[01:54:44.320 --> 01:54:50.960]  Nothing like a road trip, my kids love it, listen to album after album with George Strait.
[01:54:50.960 --> 01:55:06.360]  And if you think carbon taxes and global warming fraud isn't a scam, I'll sell you
[01:55:06.360 --> 01:55:08.520]  a bridge on the moon.
[01:55:08.520 --> 01:55:14.040]  And yes, it's made out of Swiss cheese, and if you don't agree with that, you're racist.
[01:55:14.040 --> 01:55:18.240]  And if you don't agree that Common Core's a good idea, you guessed it again, you're racist.
[01:55:18.240 --> 01:55:24.760]  And if you don't agree with MSNBC telling you the family's bad, well, you're a homophobe.
[01:55:24.760 --> 01:55:29.520]  Which song is better, Amarillo by Morning or Ocean Front Property?
[01:55:29.520 --> 01:55:32.000]  That is a really hard decision.
[01:55:32.000 --> 01:55:35.520]  Oh, right there, I don't worship the ground you walk on.
[01:55:35.520 --> 01:55:38.920]  I never have, and that's a fact.
[01:55:38.920 --> 01:55:43.520]  I never have, and that's a fact.
[01:55:43.520 --> 01:55:47.520]  I think Amarillo by Morning, because the true story, takes forever to get there.
[01:55:47.520 --> 01:55:56.120]  I try to find you, because I don't love you, now if you'll buy that.
[01:55:56.120 --> 01:56:02.200]  And if you think the American people are going to turn our guns in and go along with this,
[01:56:02.200 --> 01:56:07.800]  you know, I got a bridge I'm ready to sell you, I'm going to go back to Wild Man.
[01:56:07.800 --> 01:56:12.160]  And then we're going to move on to Ryan and Mike and Richard and Ben.
[01:56:12.160 --> 01:56:15.880]  Before I do that, it will sell out today, believe me, I wish we had enough to supply
[01:56:15.880 --> 01:56:16.880]  everybody.
[01:56:16.880 --> 01:56:20.280]  We didn't want to wait 12 weeks, that's not a sales tactic.
[01:56:20.280 --> 01:56:23.080]  About, I don't know, 20% of what's going to come in came in.
[01:56:23.080 --> 01:56:26.040]  They were able to get an early batch into us.
[01:56:26.040 --> 01:56:31.120]  These are very proprietary, patented ingredients that shrinks and concentrations that nobody
[01:56:31.120 --> 01:56:32.120]  else is putting out.
[01:56:32.120 --> 01:56:35.280]  You can find synthetic stuff out there, and it's still very expensive.
[01:56:35.280 --> 01:56:41.520]  This is not, it's DNA force, true, neutral medical, and you can read about all the amazing
[01:56:41.520 --> 01:56:44.440]  things it's on record doing.
[01:56:44.440 --> 01:56:48.880]  I got to warn you though, if you've got nerve damage and stuff, say in your knees or your
[01:56:48.880 --> 01:56:55.400]  elbows and stuff, when a lot of people call and we warned you about this, you get numb.
[01:56:55.400 --> 01:56:57.200]  And that's because the nerves are growing back.
[01:56:57.200 --> 01:56:59.720]  I mean, we can actually say that because these are patented.
[01:56:59.720 --> 01:57:03.560]  This is proven, the ingredients in here.
[01:57:03.560 --> 01:57:07.720]  Go watch the specific details, read about it at InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:57:07.720 --> 01:57:11.640]  Now we also have Occupower, it's kind of the poor man's version of it, excellent as well.
[01:57:11.640 --> 01:57:14.320]  And then we have Lung Cleanse.
[01:57:14.320 --> 01:57:18.440]  This helps me with my larynx, it helps me when I'm giving a speech.
[01:57:18.440 --> 01:57:22.840]  It helps me, you know, get over a cold quicker or clearly not get one.
[01:57:22.840 --> 01:57:29.000]  I know a very well known country music musician, I'll just leave it at that, who started using
[01:57:29.000 --> 01:57:33.280]  this in the last year since it came out, takes it on tour with him to Europe, you name it.
[01:57:33.280 --> 01:57:37.440]  And he was just here at the office, I don't know, like a year ago when some test bottles
[01:57:37.440 --> 01:57:39.920]  were here and I said, hey, try this.
[01:57:39.920 --> 01:57:42.840]  And now he's got a lot of different lozenges and things he tries to use.
[01:57:42.840 --> 01:57:45.240]  Obviously, he's a singer, that's what they do.
[01:57:45.240 --> 01:57:49.760]  They've all been discarded for InfoWars Lung Cleanse and now he buys it by the case, gives
[01:57:49.760 --> 01:57:51.240]  it to his musician friends.
[01:57:51.240 --> 01:57:53.240]  I'm going to leave it at that.
[01:57:53.240 --> 01:57:59.280]  But the point is, get your Lung Force, start using it as we go into the winter and it supports
[01:57:59.280 --> 01:58:02.360]  the entire transmission and everything we do.
[01:58:02.360 --> 01:58:11.280]  InfoWarsLife.com, InfoWars Lung Cleanse, InfoWarsLife.com, or 888-253-313, now we've got all the new
[01:58:11.280 --> 01:58:18.000]  Molan Labe Special Forces 50 Cal style and InfoWarsLife.com, InfoWarsStore.com is the

[01:59:05.720 --> 01:59:06.720]  is the tip of the spear.
[01:59:06.720 --> 01:59:10.680]  Is this another force flight stage attack to take our civil liberties and put more homelands
[01:59:10.680 --> 01:59:13.240]  in security by sticking the hands down on our pants on the streets?
[01:59:13.240 --> 01:59:17.520]  It's up to us to set brush fires in the minds of men and women everywhere and that's what
[01:59:17.520 --> 01:59:20.200]  PrisonPlanet.tv is designed to do.
[01:59:20.200 --> 01:59:26.640]  You watch the Assad regime is going to be blamed or accused of using chemical weapons against
[01:59:26.640 --> 01:59:28.520]  the so-called rebels.
[01:59:28.520 --> 01:59:32.000]  What we see now is a war against reality, it's a war against the truth.
[01:59:32.000 --> 01:59:37.560]  It's more vital than ever that supporters of freedom become members of PrisonPlanet.tv

[02:00:14.120 --> 02:00:32.320]  Jones on the GCN Radio Network and now live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:32.320 --> 02:00:39.520]  Into hour number three, tons of news, special reports and more breaking news on the Sandy
[02:00:39.520 --> 02:00:41.240]  Hook false flag.
[02:00:41.240 --> 02:00:45.280]  Man, that's an obvious false flag and orgy of evidence.
[02:00:45.280 --> 02:00:49.840]  Let's talk to a wild man in Texas, you're on the air, what do you think of Lord Holder?
[02:00:49.840 --> 02:00:54.040]  Oh my God, love you Alex, as a fellow Jesus follower.
[02:00:54.040 --> 02:00:55.840]  Love you too brother.
[02:00:55.840 --> 02:01:00.600]  Yeah, I'm here in Emeril, so Emeril by morning works for me.
[02:01:00.600 --> 02:01:05.840]  I get to, yeah, Reno's long lost brother here in a second.
[02:01:05.840 --> 02:01:12.080]  As far as the stock market, I'm close to retirement, I kind of watch all that stuff, my 401k and
[02:01:12.080 --> 02:01:15.720]  all that and I've been working since I was seven years old.
[02:01:15.720 --> 02:01:19.960]  I started shining shoes here in Emeril on Polk Street when I was seven, so.
[02:01:19.960 --> 02:01:23.520]  But you'll be looking for it when they pull that gate?
[02:01:23.520 --> 02:01:31.480]  Yeah, you bet, that's how I got it, riding bulls, you know, but anyway, with them doing
[02:01:31.480 --> 02:01:36.280]  the stock market, you had a person on your show here a couple weeks ago, I believe his
[02:01:36.280 --> 02:01:38.280]  name was Harry Dent, if I'm not mistaken.
[02:01:38.280 --> 02:01:40.080]  Yeah, I want to get him back on.
[02:01:40.080 --> 02:01:44.640]  Yeah, and I was, he really got me doing some research and stuff, of course, I got somebody
[02:01:44.640 --> 02:01:47.760]  kind of handling my stuff because I'm not real up on this stock market stuff.
[02:01:47.760 --> 02:01:51.960]  But sure, but I mean, when the baby boomers retire, that shows a downward trend in the
[02:01:51.960 --> 02:01:52.960]  global economy.
[02:01:52.960 --> 02:01:58.440]  Right, and I mean, I'm tired of them raping and pillaging my, my harder money, just like
[02:01:58.440 --> 02:02:05.880]  all the rest of us, God, men and women, and using it on stuff like arming them boneheads
[02:02:05.880 --> 02:02:08.920]  over there, the Isis or wherever you want to call them.
[02:02:08.920 --> 02:02:14.200]  But boneheads is right, but boneheads, it's just amazing that they like won't let kids
[02:02:14.200 --> 02:02:17.760]  go to school and, and like won't don't want them to learn how to read and write.
[02:02:17.760 --> 02:02:20.600]  It's as bad as it's as bad as Common Core.
[02:02:20.600 --> 02:02:24.880]  Yeah, I mean, and they, they think we're, like you say all the time, they think we're
[02:02:24.880 --> 02:02:27.120]  stupid and we don't know what's going on.
[02:02:27.120 --> 02:02:33.840]  Like God, man, it's time for us as blue blooded Americans to stand up shoulder to shoulder
[02:02:33.840 --> 02:02:39.360]  and say, okay, I think that's what's going on with old, old Janet Reno, long lost brother
[02:02:39.360 --> 02:02:46.080]  holder is they've bailing out because the, I think the regime is coming to, it's coming
[02:02:46.080 --> 02:02:47.080]  down slowly.
[02:02:47.080 --> 02:02:48.080]  But sure it is.
[02:02:48.080 --> 02:02:49.080]  It is.
[02:02:49.080 --> 02:02:52.360]  They've had the most resignations of any administration ever, except for Nixon.
[02:02:52.360 --> 02:02:53.360]  I was reading that today.
[02:02:53.360 --> 02:02:58.800]  There's only two people left in the administration that were there originally.
[02:02:58.800 --> 02:02:59.800]  What is it?
[02:02:59.800 --> 02:03:00.800]  Agriculture and transportation.
[02:03:00.800 --> 02:03:07.440]  I think I'm going for memory, but let's, let's not actually be too mean to, to, to
[02:03:07.440 --> 02:03:08.440]  Janet Reno.
[02:03:08.440 --> 02:03:11.080]  You know, her son is on MSNBC.
[02:03:11.080 --> 02:03:12.080]  Did you know that?
[02:03:12.080 --> 02:03:15.160]  I didn't know I did not watch that trash.
[02:03:15.160 --> 02:03:19.080]  No, Janet Reno's son goes by Rachel Maddow.
[02:03:19.080 --> 02:03:20.080]  Really?
[02:03:20.080 --> 02:03:21.080]  Yep.
[02:03:21.080 --> 02:03:22.080]  I did not know that.
[02:03:22.080 --> 02:03:26.680]  And two plus two equals, two plus two equals five as well.
[02:03:26.680 --> 02:03:33.840]  And our, you know, Obama's not arming al-Qaeda either, but, and the Easter Bunny's real.
[02:03:33.840 --> 02:03:34.840]  Yeah.
[02:03:34.840 --> 02:03:36.880]  I got news for him.
[02:03:36.880 --> 02:03:42.200]  You know, I acquired this, this name wild man up in Colorado, because I moved up there
[02:03:42.200 --> 02:03:46.480]  to go to high school and I guarantee you, Colorado and some like Texans and I know why,
[02:03:46.480 --> 02:03:47.880]  but that's a whole another point.
[02:03:47.880 --> 02:03:48.880]  Oh, really?
[02:03:48.880 --> 02:03:50.960]  You know, my nickname was wild man amongst others.
[02:03:50.960 --> 02:03:51.960]  Really?
[02:03:51.960 --> 02:03:52.960]  Yeah.
[02:03:52.960 --> 02:03:55.680]  So how did you, are you saying Colorado's don't like Texans?
[02:03:55.680 --> 02:03:58.160]  No, they do not like us.
[02:03:58.160 --> 02:04:03.200]  And it's, I acquired it up there back in high school in 1974.
[02:04:03.200 --> 02:04:07.640]  And when I started riding bulls and stuff, and I mean, they don't like us Texans because
[02:04:07.640 --> 02:04:14.320]  mainly because Texans, oil owners, people like that almost land up there, so they can't
[02:04:14.320 --> 02:04:18.760]  go hunt and that takes them off because it's all leased land, you know, well, it is true
[02:04:18.760 --> 02:04:22.640]  that, that almost every rich Texan I know owns a spread in Colorado.
[02:04:22.640 --> 02:04:23.640]  And why not?
[02:04:23.640 --> 02:04:24.640]  Because Colorado's beautiful.
[02:04:24.640 --> 02:04:25.640]  Yeah.
[02:04:25.640 --> 02:04:29.520]  And I told them, you know, of course me, I got in a lot of classes, I told them, well,
[02:04:29.520 --> 02:04:34.520]  you know, uh, the southern part of Colorado used to be Texas when we was our own country,
[02:04:34.520 --> 02:04:37.160]  so we just take back, you guys don't have to worry about splitting.
[02:04:37.160 --> 02:04:38.160]  That's right.
[02:04:38.160 --> 02:04:39.160]  Hey, I'm for invading Colorado.
[02:04:39.160 --> 02:04:44.280]  I think Texas ought to start invading surrounding states.
[02:04:44.280 --> 02:04:47.000]  I mean, hey, Oklahoma used to be part of Texas.
[02:04:47.000 --> 02:04:51.280]  So you're not, I'm saying we're taking it over and next Colorado, it could be our own
[02:04:51.280 --> 02:04:52.280]  new country.
[02:04:52.280 --> 02:04:58.440]  We'll call it Texacana or something and we can have like a boss hog dictator hands out
[02:04:58.440 --> 02:04:59.440]  free guns.
[02:04:59.440 --> 02:05:06.680]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[02:05:06.680 --> 02:05:11.280]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[02:05:11.280 --> 02:05:20.400]  There's a place down in Tennessee where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[02:05:20.400 --> 02:05:27.280]  They so pride in every stitch guarantee you love the way they fit.
[02:05:27.280 --> 02:05:33.640]  They put a diamond gusset in the crotch where you need it most.
[02:05:33.640 --> 02:05:38.560]  Blue diamond gussets got it, others don't.
[02:05:38.560 --> 02:05:41.040]  We turned jeans inside out.
[02:05:41.040 --> 02:05:45.400]  Diamond gusset jeans made in the USA with unparalleled quality.

[02:05:55.040 --> 02:06:00.600]  Diamond gusset jeans got it, others don't.
[02:06:00.600 --> 02:06:06.760]  In the near future, when you realize how fake it all is, the football, the basketball.
[02:06:06.760 --> 02:06:07.760]  Security alert.
[02:06:07.760 --> 02:06:13.200]  This is Homeland Security, analysis, info wars, building independent media operations.
[02:06:13.200 --> 02:06:18.200]  You let the worst people get controlled and tell us that we are the ones responsible.
[02:06:18.200 --> 02:06:21.000]  Prime Directed did credit Alex Jones.
[02:06:21.000 --> 02:06:23.560]  Jones is the wildly popular conspiracy theory.
[02:06:23.560 --> 02:06:26.840]  A popular conspiracy theory talk show called Info Wars.
[02:06:26.840 --> 02:06:29.120]  Alex Jones is now in an Austin jail.
[02:06:29.120 --> 02:06:30.840]  These people are assaulting us.
[02:06:30.840 --> 02:06:32.840]  Targeting of patriots engaged.
[02:06:32.840 --> 02:06:37.960]  They are never going to stop, they are never going to deviate from their program until
[02:06:37.960 --> 02:06:38.960]  we stop them.
[02:06:38.960 --> 02:06:39.960]  Block Free.

[02:06:49.480 --> 02:06:54.120]  You got a censor eye on the enemy, not worry about what propaganda they put out.
[02:06:54.120 --> 02:07:00.080]  Electrally, it's because you can fail it.

[02:07:11.480 --> 02:07:16.120]  And just like the other important organs in our bodies, our eyes function at peak levels
[02:07:16.120 --> 02:07:19.880]  when they are fed the proper amounts of essential nutrition.
[02:07:19.880 --> 02:07:21.400]  Open your eyes.
[02:07:21.400 --> 02:07:27.080]  Combining key ingredients like vitamin A, zinc, lutein, proprietary saffron bulb extracts

[02:09:10.760 --> 02:09:12.760]  Horsemen are drawing nearer.
[02:09:13.760 --> 02:09:15.760]  Let us eat a ride.
[02:09:16.760 --> 02:09:18.760]  And they come to take your life.

[02:09:38.760 --> 02:09:42.760]  Liberia dead Ebola patients resurrect.
[02:09:42.760 --> 02:09:44.760]  This is a real news story out of all Africa.
[02:09:44.760 --> 02:09:50.760]  Two Ebola patients who died of the virus in separate communities in Nimbia County
[02:09:50.760 --> 02:09:53.760]  have reportedly resurrected in the county.
[02:09:53.760 --> 02:09:55.760]  That means they just buried somebody that wasn't dead yet.
[02:09:55.760 --> 02:09:59.760]  The victims both females believed to be in their 60s and 40s respectively
[02:09:59.760 --> 02:10:03.760]  died of the Ebola virus recently in Hope Village Community.
[02:10:03.760 --> 02:10:06.760]  I mean, here's another one of the New York Times.
[02:10:06.760 --> 02:10:11.760]  In Liberia, home deaths spread circle of Ebola contagion.
[02:10:11.760 --> 02:10:16.760]  And they're talking about Liberia and Sierra Leone completely collapsing now.
[02:10:16.760 --> 02:10:19.760]  They're going from saying it may happen to it will probably happen.
[02:10:19.760 --> 02:10:23.760]  Sierra Leone cordons off three areas to control Ebola.
[02:10:23.760 --> 02:10:25.760]  The lockdowns have happened.
[02:10:25.760 --> 02:10:28.760]  A nice microcosm of what will happen here of mouse pox or something.
[02:10:28.760 --> 02:10:31.760]  It's out US hospitals unprepared to handle Ebola waste.
[02:10:31.760 --> 02:10:33.760]  Reuters.
[02:10:33.760 --> 02:10:34.760]  Yeah.
[02:10:34.760 --> 02:10:40.760]  And why are they bringing in like it's more than 10 people that have Ebola to the US
[02:10:40.760 --> 02:10:45.760]  and South Dakota and Florida and Georgia.
[02:10:45.760 --> 02:10:46.760]  You never did it before.
[02:10:46.760 --> 02:10:47.760]  Why are you doing it?
[02:10:47.760 --> 02:10:53.760]  Sierra Leone's quarantines one million ahead of UN Ebola talks.
[02:10:53.760 --> 02:10:55.760]  I mean, these are just wild headlines.
[02:10:55.760 --> 02:10:57.760]  Ebola virus outbreak.
[02:10:57.760 --> 02:11:03.760]  Just two doctors available treated 85,000 people in Liberia's county in one county.
[02:11:03.760 --> 02:11:08.760]  FDA warns three companies against marketing their products as Ebola treatment secures.
[02:11:08.760 --> 02:11:10.760]  That's out of the Washington Post.
[02:11:10.760 --> 02:11:13.760]  The US Food and Drug Administration sent letters to three companies this week
[02:11:13.760 --> 02:11:17.760]  warning them against marketing their products as possible treatments or cures for Ebola.
[02:11:17.760 --> 02:11:21.760]  The letters posted online Wednesday document multiple claims from the companies
[02:11:21.760 --> 02:11:25.760]  or their paid representatives that essential oils and other natural remedies
[02:11:25.760 --> 02:11:27.760]  can help prevent you contracting the Ebola virus.
[02:11:27.760 --> 02:11:32.760]  And at least one instance effectively kills the Ebola virus.
[02:11:32.760 --> 02:11:35.760]  There are currently no approved treatments cures or vaccines.
[02:11:35.760 --> 02:11:40.760]  You know, my view on this is they don't want them saying spoil silver stuff like that.
[02:11:40.760 --> 02:11:44.760]  I don't think you could say anything cures something except vitamin C.
[02:11:44.760 --> 02:11:46.760]  I mean, if you don't have vitamin C, you will get scurvy.
[02:11:46.760 --> 02:11:51.760]  And it's known fact like if a fish doesn't have water, it dies.
[02:11:51.760 --> 02:11:54.760]  Or if you don't have oxygen, a human dies.
[02:11:54.760 --> 02:11:57.760]  But according to the FDA, you're not supposed to say that if you're a medical doctor.
[02:11:57.760 --> 02:12:00.760]  You can't say oxygen is needed or the sun is needed.
[02:12:00.760 --> 02:12:03.760]  The UN voted five years ago to say the sun doesn't affect climate.
[02:12:03.760 --> 02:12:06.760]  I mean, this is like saying two plus two equals whatever Obama says.
[02:12:06.760 --> 02:12:13.760]  But I don't think you can say colloidal silver cures things,
[02:12:13.760 --> 02:12:16.760]  but it certainly is an antibiotic.
[02:12:16.760 --> 02:12:21.760]  Certainly it's an old remedy they've been using forever.
[02:12:21.760 --> 02:12:26.760]  I know I personally am getting my vitamin C up, my exercise up, my sunshine up,
[02:12:26.760 --> 02:12:30.760]  trying to be in a good mood because I've gone and looked at the numbers.
[02:12:30.760 --> 02:12:32.760]  We need to be in a good mood.
[02:12:32.760 --> 02:12:34.760]  We need to also be focused about fixing problems.
[02:12:34.760 --> 02:12:38.760]  That's what the brain wants, is to be proactive, involved, cheerful,
[02:12:38.760 --> 02:12:40.760]  but also facing the facts.
[02:12:40.760 --> 02:12:43.760]  And what I'm doing is I am taking essential oils.
[02:12:43.760 --> 02:12:45.760]  I am eating garlic.
[02:12:45.760 --> 02:12:49.760]  I am trying to get my immune system boosted, but not because of Ebola.
[02:12:49.760 --> 02:12:51.760]  That's part of it, a very small part.
[02:12:51.760 --> 02:12:53.760]  I don't think that's going to be a big deal here, I hope.
[02:12:53.760 --> 02:12:57.760]  Horrible for Africa, top urologist saying five million could die.
[02:12:57.760 --> 02:13:02.760]  What is, is all these superbugs and superbacteria that are killing so many people.
[02:13:02.760 --> 02:13:04.760]  That's why I'm trying to get healthy.
[02:13:04.760 --> 02:13:08.760]  That's why I'm getting really serious about getting my sleep and all the rest of it
[02:13:08.760 --> 02:13:12.760]  because no good to the world if we're dead, folks.
[02:13:12.760 --> 02:13:16.760]  And I think this winter, you're already seeing this mystery illness that's connected to vaccines
[02:13:16.760 --> 02:13:21.760]  and there's only vaccinated kids are getting in as they go to school, hurting people, killing people.
[02:13:21.760 --> 02:13:24.760]  I mean, hey, here's what I'm doing personally.
[02:13:24.760 --> 02:13:25.760]  I'm drinking purified water.
[02:13:25.760 --> 02:13:27.760]  I'm taking high quality vitamins and minerals.
[02:13:27.760 --> 02:13:31.760]  I'm getting more exercise, more sunshine, more sleep, trying to be in a good mood.
[02:13:31.760 --> 02:13:37.760]  And I'm not taking any of these government drugs and that's why they're going after companies out there
[02:13:37.760 --> 02:13:42.760]  is they only want Bill Gates and Monsanto to come out with that Ebola vaccine.
[02:13:42.760 --> 02:13:50.760]  They don't, which most vaccines say on the insert, they can't prove it even will protect you from MMR or whatever the case is.
[02:13:50.760 --> 02:13:56.760]  So they can't even really say, but they'll advertise the Ebola vaccine like it secured everything.
[02:13:56.760 --> 02:14:02.760]  I mean, it's like roguined guys put on their heads so their hair doesn't fall out.
[02:14:02.760 --> 02:14:03.760]  I've talked to guys.
[02:14:03.760 --> 02:14:08.760]  They say, yeah, it makes little hair grow, but they can actually say proven to regrow hair.
[02:14:08.760 --> 02:14:10.760]  You know, in certain things, 25% of the time or something.
[02:14:10.760 --> 02:14:11.760]  I don't know.
[02:14:11.760 --> 02:14:13.760]  I read about it a while back because my hair is falling out.
[02:14:13.760 --> 02:14:15.760]  I'm kind of like, eh, what's the point?
[02:14:15.760 --> 02:14:17.760]  I just kind of want to get it there, though.
[02:14:17.760 --> 02:14:21.760]  You know, if it's going to fall out, let's just get it there.
[02:14:21.760 --> 02:14:22.760]  Maybe I should, you know what?
[02:14:22.760 --> 02:14:23.760]  I think I was there 20, 30 pounds.
[02:14:23.760 --> 02:14:25.760]  I may just shave it.
[02:14:25.760 --> 02:14:27.760]  The Mr. Clean look.
[02:14:27.760 --> 02:14:31.760]  I'm kind of jealous of folks that, you know, can sport the Chrome Dome.
[02:14:31.760 --> 02:14:34.760]  Jacari pulls it off.
[02:14:34.760 --> 02:14:36.760]  The thing is you got to be in shape.
[02:14:36.760 --> 02:14:39.760]  You got to be, you can't have extra fat if you shave your head.
[02:14:39.760 --> 02:14:43.760]  So if I get there, I think I'm going to shave this sucker.
[02:14:43.760 --> 02:14:46.760]  In the new look, I'll grow a goatee and act tough.
[02:14:46.760 --> 02:14:48.760]  I'm joking.
[02:14:48.760 --> 02:14:49.760]  Won't do that.
[02:14:49.760 --> 02:14:52.760]  What do they call the little flavor savers?
[02:14:52.760 --> 02:14:55.760]  Grow one of those is like a Hitler.
[02:14:55.760 --> 02:14:56.760]  So patch or a Van Dyke?
[02:14:56.760 --> 02:14:57.760]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:14:57.760 --> 02:14:58.760]  So patch Van Dyke.
[02:14:58.760 --> 02:14:59.760]  Little thing under.
[02:14:59.760 --> 02:15:00.760]  I'm joking.
[02:15:00.760 --> 02:15:01.760]  I'm not going to get one of those.
[02:15:01.760 --> 02:15:03.760]  Hey, I'm not knocking the facial hair craze.
[02:15:03.760 --> 02:15:06.760]  I can grow a Santa Claus beard.
[02:15:06.760 --> 02:15:08.760]  But I just don't like to mess with it.
[02:15:08.760 --> 02:15:13.760]  I mean, if I lived in the Arctic or something, when I was about 20, I grew a beard for about
[02:15:13.760 --> 02:15:14.760]  two weeks.
[02:15:14.760 --> 02:15:16.760]  It was brown, brown, red.
[02:15:16.760 --> 02:15:19.760]  And it was like that long and it itched.
[02:15:19.760 --> 02:15:22.760]  I don't like it.
[02:15:22.760 --> 02:15:23.760]  I'm going to be honest.
[02:15:23.760 --> 02:15:26.760]  Look, look how much hair I got on my arms, folks.
[02:15:26.760 --> 02:15:29.760]  I mean, you think I can grow a beard?
[02:15:29.760 --> 02:15:30.760]  Oh, yeah.
[02:15:30.760 --> 02:15:31.760]  Big time.
[02:15:31.760 --> 02:15:35.760]  But the guys that have the beard, they like sport it like, you're not a man.
[02:15:35.760 --> 02:15:36.760]  You don't have this beard.
[02:15:36.760 --> 02:15:39.760]  They think the movie 300s would brought beards in.
[02:15:39.760 --> 02:15:41.760]  I really think so.
[02:15:41.760 --> 02:15:44.760]  And it's like, no, I don't have beard envy.
[02:15:44.760 --> 02:15:47.760]  In fact, I feel sorry for you.
[02:15:47.760 --> 02:15:48.760]  This is not a morning show.
[02:15:48.760 --> 02:15:49.760]  I'm sorry.
[02:15:49.760 --> 02:15:51.760]  I'm kind of in a babbly mood today.
[02:15:51.760 --> 02:15:53.760]  Ryan in Oklahoma.
[02:15:53.760 --> 02:15:55.760]  Thanks for holding.
[02:15:55.760 --> 02:15:56.760]  You're on the air.
[02:15:56.760 --> 02:15:57.760]  Go ahead.
[02:15:57.760 --> 02:15:58.760]  Oh, Alex.
[02:15:58.760 --> 02:16:07.760]  I might need some help articulating this because it's one story, but it kind of has.
[02:16:07.760 --> 02:16:09.760]  Go ahead, Ryan.
[02:16:09.760 --> 02:16:12.760]  Man.
[02:16:12.760 --> 02:16:15.760]  It's really weird because this guy called in yesterday, but it was the end of the show,
[02:16:15.760 --> 02:16:16.760]  so I didn't get to him.
[02:16:16.760 --> 02:16:17.760]  So I wanted to go to him now.
[02:16:17.760 --> 02:16:20.760]  Ryan, talk right into that telephone.
[02:16:20.760 --> 02:16:21.760]  Yeah.
[02:16:21.760 --> 02:16:22.760]  Yeah.
[02:16:22.760 --> 02:16:23.760]  He's got a bad cell phone.
[02:16:23.760 --> 02:16:24.760]  We'll try him later.
[02:16:24.760 --> 02:16:28.760]  He can get to a good spot because he's been trying to get in so long.
[02:16:28.760 --> 02:16:32.760]  But Mike in South Carolina, you're on the air.
[02:16:32.760 --> 02:16:33.760]  Hey, Alex.
[02:16:33.760 --> 02:16:40.760]  I wanted to talk about the timing of holders' resignation and what they're trying to
[02:16:40.760 --> 02:16:45.760]  accomplish and or avoid.
[02:16:45.760 --> 02:16:53.760]  Do you think that Obama is trying to push through another AG before the Republicans take over
[02:16:53.760 --> 02:16:54.760]  the Senate?
[02:16:54.760 --> 02:16:55.760]  Exactly.
[02:16:55.760 --> 02:17:01.760]  And then they'll have to have the controversy of getting rid of one when the new administration
[02:17:01.760 --> 02:17:02.760]  comes in.
[02:17:02.760 --> 02:17:03.760]  I think they're putting in fresh meat.
[02:17:03.760 --> 02:17:08.760]  Holder has been battered and tarnished with all the scandals he's been caught in, and
[02:17:08.760 --> 02:17:10.760]  he's in his contempt of Congress hearings right now.
[02:17:10.760 --> 02:17:12.760]  So that investigation goes forward.
[02:17:12.760 --> 02:17:18.760]  So, just like they got rid of Big Sis, she has outlived her usefulness like toilet paper.
[02:17:18.760 --> 02:17:24.760]  Well, it came out the other day also that Justice Ginsburg has refused to resign.
[02:17:24.760 --> 02:17:28.760]  Do you think they're looking for another Supreme Court nominee?
[02:17:28.760 --> 02:17:29.760]  Oh, of course.
[02:17:29.760 --> 02:17:35.760]  They want to get a new young person to officiate gay weddings in there, like Kagan.
[02:17:35.760 --> 02:17:36.760]  I mean, that's important.
[02:17:36.760 --> 02:17:39.760]  They're telling you a little bit of call the Supreme Court to officiate your gay wedding
[02:17:39.760 --> 02:17:40.760]  in D.C.
[02:17:40.760 --> 02:17:43.760]  So they've got to have just a lineup of Janet Reno clones.
[02:17:43.760 --> 02:17:50.760]  I think they should literally clone Janet Reno and make all nine of them 6'3 giant cousin
[02:17:50.760 --> 02:17:58.760]  it, hunchback weird cave trolls that chase skirts around D.C.
[02:17:58.760 --> 02:18:05.760]  I mean, it's not that I'm even against lesbians, folks, but it's discriminatory that an ugly
[02:18:05.760 --> 02:18:12.760]  white woman with a commando haircut, that's all you can have now as federal judges or
[02:18:12.760 --> 02:18:14.760]  the Supreme Court.
[02:18:14.760 --> 02:18:20.760]  I mean, listen, Elena Kagan actually starred in the new Batman's that came out in the 90s,
[02:18:20.760 --> 02:18:22.760]  the first remakes as the Penguin.
[02:18:22.760 --> 02:18:27.760]  Can we pull up Mayor Cobblebot or whatever his name is?
[02:18:27.760 --> 02:18:30.760]  I mean, listen, I'm going to be honest with you.
[02:18:30.760 --> 02:18:34.760]  Elena Kagan, I joke about clones and I shouldn't do it and it's wrong.
[02:18:34.760 --> 02:18:36.760]  And it's tasteless.
[02:18:36.760 --> 02:18:39.760]  But it's not funny what they did.
[02:18:39.760 --> 02:18:46.760]  They stole Danny DeVito's genetic blueprint and crossed it with Janet Reno and created
[02:18:46.760 --> 02:18:47.760]  Elena Kagan.
[02:18:47.760 --> 02:18:48.760]  She's not a real person.
[02:18:48.760 --> 02:18:51.760]  She's not 48 years old or whatever they say she is.
[02:18:51.760 --> 02:18:54.760]  She's actually a genetic splice programmable creature.
[02:18:54.760 --> 02:19:00.760]  And actually let's, I mean, can we show folks the shot of Elena Kagan over TV viewers?
[02:19:00.760 --> 02:19:03.760]  I mean, just just type in the Penguin.
[02:19:03.760 --> 02:19:05.760]  So there you go.
[02:19:05.760 --> 02:19:08.760]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is uncanny.
[02:19:08.760 --> 02:19:09.760]  Uncanny.
[02:19:09.760 --> 02:19:12.760]  Okay, this is satire, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:19:12.760 --> 02:19:13.760]  Anything else, sir?
[02:19:13.760 --> 02:19:14.760]  I apologize.
[02:19:14.760 --> 02:19:19.760]  At least Janet Reno deported Ellie and Gonzalez.
[02:19:19.760 --> 02:19:20.760]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:19:20.760 --> 02:19:25.760]  Well, you know about Janet Reno when she was a prosecutor, what she got caught doing, right?
[02:19:25.760 --> 02:19:27.760]  It was even in the Miami Papers.
[02:19:27.760 --> 02:19:29.760]  You know about her?
[02:19:29.760 --> 02:19:31.760]  Well, I lived there then.
[02:19:31.760 --> 02:19:36.760]  Oh, so you know about the little kids?
[02:19:36.760 --> 02:19:38.760]  Not exactly.
[02:19:38.760 --> 02:19:42.760]  Well, sir, I'm sorry that I've been in satire mode today, but that was serious about her
[02:19:42.760 --> 02:19:45.760]  and the 13-year-old girl on the back of the car covered in vomit.
[02:19:45.760 --> 02:19:49.760]  Reno's so drunken on pills she couldn't even talk when the state police found her.
[02:19:49.760 --> 02:19:50.760]  That guy swept over the rug.
[02:19:50.760 --> 02:19:51.760]  Anything else, sir?
[02:19:51.760 --> 02:19:52.760]  No, that's it, Alex.
[02:19:52.760 --> 02:19:53.760]  God bless you.
[02:19:53.760 --> 02:19:54.760]  Thanks for putting up with me.

[02:21:58.760 --> 02:21:59.760]  Question.
[02:21:59.760 --> 02:22:03.760]  Could too many GMO foods and toxins be overloading your digestive and immune systems?

[02:24:23.760 --> 02:24:25.760]  It's bold.
[02:24:25.760 --> 02:24:29.760]  He could shit over cases about him and would probably not recuse himself.
[02:24:29.760 --> 02:24:30.760]  Totally criminal.
[02:24:30.760 --> 02:24:31.760]  They would do it.
[02:24:31.760 --> 02:24:33.760]  See, because it's all about being over the top.
[02:24:33.760 --> 02:24:39.760]  It's all about just rubbing our faces in it and saying we're racist if we don't want to turn our guns into
[02:24:39.760 --> 02:24:45.760]  Eric Holder with all his bodyguards.
[02:24:45.760 --> 02:24:47.760]  What a bunch of disconnected weirdos.
[02:24:47.760 --> 02:24:48.760]  All their political correctness.
[02:24:48.760 --> 02:24:52.760]  You don't like it because I'm black and you don't like Kagan because she's a lesbian.
[02:24:52.760 --> 02:24:57.760]  No, I don't like Kagan because she's another authoritarian dirtbag with bodyguards that wants my guns.
[02:24:57.760 --> 02:25:03.760]  And was involved in all sorts of corruption and bizarre court cases, violating people's rights.
[02:25:03.760 --> 02:25:08.760]  She's an authoritarian.
[02:25:08.760 --> 02:25:14.760]  And I think it's discriminatory now that you can only have lesbian women in charge of things in government.
[02:25:14.760 --> 02:25:17.760]  Let's go ahead and talk to Richard in Pennsylvania.
[02:25:17.760 --> 02:25:19.760]  You're on the air. Go ahead.
[02:25:19.760 --> 02:25:25.760]  Hi, Alex. I've been listening to your show about for a year and a half now.
[02:25:25.760 --> 02:25:36.760]  I'd just like to say that I'm actually taking a major in information technology over at a major technology college over here in Pennsylvania.
[02:25:36.760 --> 02:25:47.760]  Now, I've seen a growing trend of the NSA and other institutions trying to recruit people within the field of IT.
[02:25:47.760 --> 02:26:00.760]  Well, yeah, there's a giant Manhattan Project on steroids program just where everything will be the NSA or these agencies and just ubiquitous spying at every level.
[02:26:00.760 --> 02:26:14.760]  Yeah, and it's definitely disconcerting because I'm even seeing it going into cultural Marxism trying to get women who don't even want to get into STEM majors in order to recruit them to build these giant data.
[02:26:14.760 --> 02:26:17.760]  Giant databases for the NSA.
[02:26:17.760 --> 02:26:26.760]  Oh, yeah. When I bring up women, it's because secret documents just came out with the video game makers, Sony and Microsoft being advised by quote, top feminist.
[02:26:26.760 --> 02:26:31.760]  There's an article out today about in a study women want a man that makes money.
[02:26:31.760 --> 02:26:41.760]  Well, now the men are being phased out to have jobs and any state run system is trying to put women in charge of things, but only to break up any human community.
[02:26:41.760 --> 02:26:49.760]  And then they tell women, carry out this authoritarianism because it empowers women or, you know, we need women for the NSA. Join the NSA.
[02:26:49.760 --> 02:26:53.760]  You know, you you you'll violate people's rights. That'll show them in.
[02:26:53.760 --> 02:26:58.760]  And so, yes, it's an attempt to totally scramble the culture not to empower women.
[02:26:58.760 --> 02:27:02.760]  And so they sell it all as, you know, it's girls against the guys and vice versa.
[02:27:02.760 --> 02:27:10.760]  And then the women are 45 desperately trying to get a guy and, you know, but she's just not happy with the construction worker husband.
[02:27:10.760 --> 02:27:14.760]  You know, she's making 200 grand a year. He's making 50 grand a year.
[02:27:14.760 --> 02:27:20.760]  And, you know, she wants a man, but at the same time she wants to boss him around, but it doesn't satisfy her.
[02:27:20.760 --> 02:27:25.760]  So then she goes and gets a pet that does whatever, you know, she says, then she hates him.
[02:27:25.760 --> 02:27:28.760]  And then she goes out and gets her a woman and that doesn't satisfy her.
[02:27:28.760 --> 02:27:32.760]  And then she's 60 and that's, you know, she doesn't have kids, doesn't have Jack squat.
[02:27:32.760 --> 02:27:36.760]  But hey, she worked for the government. She's powerful.
[02:27:36.760 --> 02:27:42.760]  Yay. I hear you. Good to hear from you, Richard. Ben in Missouri, you're on the air. Go ahead.
[02:27:42.760 --> 02:27:45.760]  Hey, Alex, how's it going? Good.
[02:27:45.760 --> 02:27:50.760]  First of all, I just wanted to say, I know he doesn't understand yet, but happy birthday.
[02:27:50.760 --> 02:27:58.760]  My son's one year old today, very healthy, climbs on everything and he's not vaccinated because I'm deeply racist.
[02:27:58.760 --> 02:28:01.760]  You know, the word son is a little bit politically incorrect.
[02:28:01.760 --> 02:28:06.760]  Like American flags are or brown bags are racist in Seattle. So let's just not call him.
[02:28:06.760 --> 02:28:18.760]  Let's be gender neutral. You have a human resource bot one year old being scheduled for programming for unification with the great mother ship of the great state.
[02:28:18.760 --> 02:28:22.760]  Oh, Eugenics. I love you, Obama.
[02:28:22.760 --> 02:28:27.760]  Exactly. Exactly. My offspring is one year old today.
[02:28:27.760 --> 02:28:33.760]  Not your offspring. It's the states. MSNBC said so. And a black woman said it.
[02:28:33.760 --> 02:28:40.760]  So it's racist if you don't agree. The state runs the kids. Racist, racist, white scum. Go ahead. Sorry.
[02:28:40.760 --> 02:28:47.760]  Absolutely. No problem. So first of all, I was down in Austin a few months ago and our trade publication.
[02:28:47.760 --> 02:28:57.760]  I was at the American Association of Physics and Medicine conference in our trade publication that month that said that nanosilver particles actually fight cancer.
[02:28:57.760 --> 02:28:59.760]  So documented scientific research.
[02:28:59.760 --> 02:29:08.760]  I don't care what scientific research says. Okay, the polar bears can't swim. They're all dead. Al Gore said so. Silver does not help anything.
[02:29:08.760 --> 02:29:15.760]  It does. It does. He does nothing to fight microbes. Nothing. Nothing.
[02:29:15.760 --> 02:29:17.760]  It's a conspiracy theory. Yes, anything else racist?
[02:29:17.760 --> 02:29:19.760]  It's a conspiracy theory. Yes.
[02:29:19.760 --> 02:29:26.760]  Yeah. And I also wanted to say, speaking of people who look like other people, Diane Feinstein, I think she was in kindergarten cop.
[02:29:26.760 --> 02:29:29.760]  She was the villain in kindergarten cop.
[02:29:29.760 --> 02:29:36.760]  I saw a horse's butt one time that looked like Diane Feinstein. I'm serious. I'm not trying to be mean here.
[02:29:36.760 --> 02:29:45.760]  I mean, it was a dead horse in the ditch and it was flies all over the place. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I was having a flashback to Diane Feinstein.
[02:29:45.760 --> 02:29:47.760]  Thank you so much, sir. Thank you very much.
[02:29:47.760 --> 02:29:49.760]  We're in a serious in a minute, okay?
[02:29:49.760 --> 02:29:51.760]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:29:51.760 --> 02:29:52.760]  We're going to get started.
[02:29:52.760 --> 02:29:54.760]  Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[02:29:54.760 --> 02:30:17.760]  Right ahead.
[02:30:54.760 --> 02:30:59.760]  We're going to get started.
[02:31:25.760 --> 02:31:32.760]  The government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo.
[02:31:32.760 --> 02:31:36.760]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[02:31:36.760 --> 02:31:38.760]  Can you put two and two together?
[02:31:38.760 --> 02:31:46.760]  Infidel Body Armor can stop every round, including hollow points and 308 sniper rounds, is reasonably priced and fully legal.
[02:31:46.760 --> 02:31:54.760]  But for how long? Go to infidelbodyarmor.com, spelled I-N-F-I-D-E-L body armor.com.
[02:31:54.760 --> 02:31:58.760]  Infidel Body Armor just won't quit.
[02:31:58.760 --> 02:32:05.760]  Another major health threat. This one in Toledo, Ohio, where everybody in the entire city has been told not to drink the water.
[02:32:05.760 --> 02:32:07.760]  Ohio's governor declaring a state of emergency.
[02:32:07.760 --> 02:32:14.760]  Did you know that the average person uses about 80 to 100 gallons of water at home every single day?
[02:32:14.760 --> 02:32:17.760]  If there's a water emergency, will you be prepared?
[02:32:17.760 --> 02:32:20.760]  Panicked residents forming long lines throughout the day.
[02:32:20.760 --> 02:32:25.760]  We're here at a supermarket in Toledo. You can see the shelves empty where water once was.
[02:32:25.760 --> 02:32:31.760]  To stay safe and healthy during a crisis, you must have access to safe, clean water.
[02:32:31.760 --> 02:32:34.760]  Water which will not be available at your local grocery store.
[02:32:34.760 --> 02:32:37.760]  There's a mad dash on right now to stock up on supplies.

[02:33:13.760 --> 02:33:31.760]  In defense of human liberty, Alex Jones.
[02:33:31.760 --> 02:33:46.760]  Well, according to FBI crime statistics at fbi.gov, no one died in 2012 in Sandy Hook. It shows no homicides in that town.
[02:33:46.760 --> 02:33:51.760]  And that story by Don Salazar is online at infowars.com.
[02:33:51.760 --> 02:33:55.760]  We'll put that on screen. Show some screenshots of those statistics for TV viewers.
[02:33:55.760 --> 02:34:00.760]  Again, radio listeners can go there and pull that up for themselves.
[02:34:00.760 --> 02:34:09.760]  But Wolfgang W. Halbig was a state police officer, then a customs enforcement officer.
[02:34:09.760 --> 02:34:12.760]  And then he went on to head up major university security.
[02:34:12.760 --> 02:34:21.760]  And then he runs one of the biggest school security of college, but also K-12 security programs.
[02:34:21.760 --> 02:34:28.760]  And he's been featured before going public questioning Sandy Hook on Dateline NBC.
[02:34:28.760 --> 02:34:32.760]  Good morning, America. I'm not going to go over it all, but he really is a leading expert.
[02:34:32.760 --> 02:34:37.760]  When we started seeing him speak out in the last year, we went and checked into him.
[02:34:37.760 --> 02:34:43.760]  And facebook.com forward slash Sandy Hook Justice or sandyhookjustice.com.
[02:34:43.760 --> 02:34:47.760]  And he has gone up there. He has investigated.
[02:34:47.760 --> 02:34:51.760]  I want him to briefly recap.
[02:34:51.760 --> 02:34:57.760]  And by the way, if he wants a bunch of business, this is the opposite way to do it with government contracts to go and stir all this trouble up.
[02:34:57.760 --> 02:35:00.760]  And he's explained, I mean, he's been visited by the feds. He's been threatened.
[02:35:00.760 --> 02:35:02.760]  And that's when he really turned the heat up.
[02:35:02.760 --> 02:35:05.760]  So as an investigator, he knows when people are acting scared.
[02:35:05.760 --> 02:35:10.760]  They told him, they said, just stop looking. You need to quit looking, buddy.
[02:35:10.760 --> 02:35:12.760]  If there wasn't something there, they just laugh at him.
[02:35:12.760 --> 02:35:17.760]  And you look at the videos of the kids walking in circles in and out for the news cameras.
[02:35:17.760 --> 02:35:19.760]  And they come right out a minute later. It's the same ones.
[02:35:19.760 --> 02:35:26.760]  And, you know, they catch an anti-terrorism guy out in the bushes and say they didn't and no emergency helicopters were sent.
[02:35:26.760 --> 02:35:31.760]  And you've got the green screens of Anderson Cooper's nose disappearing.
[02:35:31.760 --> 02:35:36.760]  And you just, it just goes on and on, on and on, on and on.
[02:35:36.760 --> 02:35:37.760]  Perfect timing.
[02:35:37.760 --> 02:35:41.760]  You got Bloomberg sending the email out the day before to get ready for a big event.
[02:35:41.760 --> 02:35:42.760]  That's been streamed news.
[02:35:42.760 --> 02:35:46.760]  But now, and again, we're going to pull the article up and put it on screen.
[02:35:46.760 --> 02:35:49.760]  In fact, if you scroll down, guys, I'll get in the headline. Thank you.
[02:35:49.760 --> 02:35:52.760]  FBI says no one killed at Sandy Hook.
[02:35:52.760 --> 02:35:58.760]  Agency publishes crime report showing zero murders occurred in Newtown in 2012, even though that happened in December.
[02:35:58.760 --> 02:36:03.760]  And that's from the FBI crime statistics, which are unusually accurate.
[02:36:03.760 --> 02:36:04.760]  There's some of the best statistics out there.
[02:36:04.760 --> 02:36:07.760]  Don't believe me. Just look into it because they're compiled locally.
[02:36:07.760 --> 02:36:11.760]  Now you could say it's a mistake, but it just adds to everything.
[02:36:11.760 --> 02:36:15.760]  And Wolfgang has been back up there. He's doing a serious investigation.
[02:36:15.760 --> 02:36:18.760]  He's been getting Stonewall, but has learned a lot.
[02:36:18.760 --> 02:36:23.760]  So Wolfgang recap the basic anomalies and then give us what happened in your new investigation.
[02:36:23.760 --> 02:36:29.760]  And then let's talk about this new piece of evidence. Is it important or can we get a response from the FBI?
[02:36:29.760 --> 02:36:30.760]  Thank you, Wolfgang for joining us.
[02:36:30.760 --> 02:36:32.760]  Well, you know, I did get a response.
[02:36:32.760 --> 02:36:36.760]  I called the New Haven FBI offices and their responses.
[02:36:36.760 --> 02:36:43.760]  Well, they've been asked by the Connecticut State Police not to put those numbers on their data sheet.
[02:36:43.760 --> 02:36:47.760]  Now, when has the state police ever told the FBI what to do?
[02:36:47.760 --> 02:36:51.760]  I mean, I mean, that's just unheard of.
[02:36:51.760 --> 02:36:57.760]  And you know, you got to remember President Obama, Obama called the director Robert Mueller in those days.
[02:36:57.760 --> 02:37:02.760]  And he told Director Mueller, take the wreck charge of the investigation in San Diego.
[02:37:02.760 --> 02:37:07.760]  Now today, because people have the courage to share this data with us,
[02:37:07.760 --> 02:37:12.760]  can you imagine no murders in Newtown in the year 2012?
[02:37:12.760 --> 02:37:17.760]  The FBI has to keep accurate records. They keep it for the whole country.
[02:37:17.760 --> 02:37:25.760]  Why do they do that? Because that's how the federal government allocates grant monies to states so they can fight violence.
[02:37:25.760 --> 02:37:28.760]  Now here's San Diego, they've already got over $200 million.
[02:37:28.760 --> 02:37:33.760]  So what? There's nobody who died in 2012 in Newtown.
[02:37:33.760 --> 02:37:36.760]  Incredible. What do you think is going on here?
[02:37:36.760 --> 02:37:40.760]  And then let's get into your new evidence, your second leg of your investigation.
[02:37:40.760 --> 02:37:44.760]  Well, I think the big thing is that, you know, I forgot about it.
[02:37:44.760 --> 02:37:49.760]  I mean, I'm a FEMA trained person. I really forgot about the homeland, you know,
[02:37:49.760 --> 02:37:55.760]  Homeland Security under, there was a Senator Lieberman.
[02:37:55.760 --> 02:38:00.760]  He's the one that was in charge of putting FEMA and Homeland Security under one umbrella.
[02:38:00.760 --> 02:38:03.760]  And they came up with this word capstone.
[02:38:03.760 --> 02:38:09.760]  Alex, the American people need to wake up and listen to what these exercises are.
[02:38:09.760 --> 02:38:14.760]  If Homeland Security FEMA capstone exercise, it starts at the White House,
[02:38:14.760 --> 02:38:21.760]  at the President's desk, goes all the way through Congress, through the Attorney General,
[02:38:21.760 --> 02:38:24.760]  down through the FBI, all the way to the local government.
[02:38:24.760 --> 02:38:28.760]  It is a whole community event.
[02:38:28.760 --> 02:38:30.760]  And I think that's what happened at Sandy Hook.
[02:38:30.760 --> 02:38:34.760]  That's why when I just did a workshop with 200 school board members,
[02:38:34.760 --> 02:38:39.760]  and you know what they asked me, well, how does the whole community involved in this?
[02:38:39.760 --> 02:38:43.760]  How in the world can you get a community that engaged?
[02:38:43.760 --> 02:38:46.760]  It's a capstone event.
[02:38:46.760 --> 02:38:50.760]  There's so much money now flowing into Newtown. It's unbelievable.
[02:38:50.760 --> 02:38:54.760]  And if you've got control of the FBI and the agencies and the media,
[02:38:54.760 --> 02:38:57.760]  that you get them all involved in the corruption up front,
[02:38:57.760 --> 02:39:01.760]  it only involves really a few of the main controllers.
[02:39:01.760 --> 02:39:05.760]  Maybe I would guess 100 people or so, and then everybody kind of saw the kids
[02:39:05.760 --> 02:39:08.760]  and saw a simulation just like the Boston bombing.
[02:39:08.760 --> 02:39:15.760]  I mean, I had a former super-high-level CIA guy who ran foreign operations on steel last week.
[02:39:15.760 --> 02:39:19.760]  And he said bottom line, and not just from the evidence, but from his sources,
[02:39:19.760 --> 02:39:22.760]  he said Boston and Sandy Hook were staged.
[02:39:22.760 --> 02:39:24.760]  Dr. Steve Pacinac ran.
[02:39:24.760 --> 02:39:26.760]  The Camp David Accords wrote the books with Tom Clancy.
[02:39:26.760 --> 02:39:28.760]  He's the Jack Ryan character.
[02:39:28.760 --> 02:39:32.760]  He's been in combat situations at least 10 times.
[02:39:32.760 --> 02:39:34.760]  And he said day one, it was staged.
[02:39:34.760 --> 02:39:37.760]  I mean, these are heavy hitters saying this.
[02:39:37.760 --> 02:39:41.760]  Pacinac ran psychological warfare for the CIA, basically, in the Pentagon.
[02:39:41.760 --> 02:39:43.760]  He was above it, from the State Department.
[02:39:43.760 --> 02:39:46.760]  And anybody that knows knows the State Department runs those.
[02:39:46.760 --> 02:39:49.760]  Runs the Army, you name it. That's where the actual orders come from.
[02:39:49.760 --> 02:39:52.760]  I've got a cousin in Black Ops, and he said your show's absolutely accurate.
[02:39:52.760 --> 02:39:55.760]  All orders come from the State Department, not even from the Pentagon.
[02:39:55.760 --> 02:39:59.760]  So I knew it stunk. I mean, why would Anderson Cooper turn and be a green screen,
[02:39:59.760 --> 02:40:01.760]  and his nose disappear?
[02:40:01.760 --> 02:40:04.760]  Why would they have kids going in and coming out clearly staged?
[02:40:04.760 --> 02:40:08.760]  I just didn't...early on, I said, well, they had to have killed somebody.
[02:40:08.760 --> 02:40:10.760]  I mean, this doesn't make sense.
[02:40:10.760 --> 02:40:13.760]  Then parents come out and start laughing, and then turn to the camera and cry.
[02:40:13.760 --> 02:40:16.760]  I mean, this stinks to high heaven. This is what you do.
[02:40:16.760 --> 02:40:21.760]  Tell us why you question up front, recapping for new listeners,
[02:40:21.760 --> 02:40:25.760]  and then get into...I know you went back and visited recently and tell us what happened.
[02:40:25.760 --> 02:40:32.760]  Well, you know, the big thing that we found is we actually found the only footage, live footage,
[02:40:32.760 --> 02:40:37.760]  shot by a helicopter. It's the only footage, Alex, that has a time stamp on it
[02:40:37.760 --> 02:40:40.760]  when you see the people chasing each other in the woods.
[02:40:40.760 --> 02:40:44.760]  Remember, that's what CNN really did. They try to hook everybody,
[02:40:44.760 --> 02:40:48.760]  and they're showing these people running and running into the woods,
[02:40:48.760 --> 02:40:55.760]  because guess what? They announced that a teacher just reported seeing two shadows running by the gym.
[02:40:55.760 --> 02:41:01.760]  Well, Alex, that footage was not shot till 12, 23 in the afternoon.
[02:41:01.760 --> 02:41:05.760]  Now, why would you chase somebody in the woods after lunch?
[02:41:05.760 --> 02:41:11.760]  The school was safe and secure by 10.35. These are all scripted events.
[02:41:11.760 --> 02:41:18.760]  These were events that were specially shot, filmed, choreographed for CNN to have fun with it.
[02:41:18.760 --> 02:41:22.760]  Absolutely, and we caught them with the blue screen, and CNN's been caught faking stuff before.
[02:41:22.760 --> 02:41:28.760]  But let's go back to the beginning. As a top, I mean, you gotta be the top five on record
[02:41:28.760 --> 02:41:32.760]  experts on school security in the country. You buy into it at first.
[02:41:32.760 --> 02:41:34.760]  I mean, remember you saying that, and then you start to have questions.
[02:41:34.760 --> 02:41:41.760]  Aught into it. But you know what? When I woke up is when I realized there were no trauma helicopters.
[02:41:41.760 --> 02:41:44.760]  At Hartford, they could have put the trauma doctors knowing that...
[02:41:44.760 --> 02:41:49.760]  You got a bunch of kids shot? You don't even ask questions. Default helicopters launch.
[02:41:49.760 --> 02:41:53.760]  They're gone. You know what? And the thing is, I even call a live star.
[02:41:53.760 --> 02:41:58.760]  What upset live star is they never got a call even asking them to stand by.
[02:41:58.760 --> 02:42:08.760]  And then, you know, who said that all these children and teachers are dead within 11 minutes?
[02:42:08.760 --> 02:42:09.760]  That's unheard of.
[02:42:09.760 --> 02:42:13.760]  Sounds like Breitbart. Within one hour of him going to the hospital, they announced he was dead.
[02:42:13.760 --> 02:42:14.760]  Natural causes.
[02:42:14.760 --> 02:42:21.760]  Yeah, but who does that? For children, you know, the pediatric protocols tell us that if you have a child
[02:42:21.760 --> 02:42:27.760]  who's shot at home or in a school, boy, you transport him and you get him to the hospital as quickly as possible.
[02:42:27.760 --> 02:42:32.760]  That never happened. And then we're like he said, we're the 600 other kids.
[02:42:32.760 --> 02:42:36.760]  We can't find 600 kids. Where are they?
[02:42:36.760 --> 02:42:37.760]  I mean...
[02:42:37.760 --> 02:42:39.760]  Why did they tear the school down? Why did they let anybody in?
[02:42:39.760 --> 02:42:41.760]  Why are they keeping all the records so secret?
[02:42:41.760 --> 02:42:45.760]  Well, I think because, you know, people forget.
[02:42:45.760 --> 02:42:51.760]  On the headlines in the Hartford current, they showed where Sandy Hook was loaded with toxic...
[02:42:51.760 --> 02:42:55.760]  It was a toxic waste dump. Alex, it's a toxic waste dump.
[02:42:55.760 --> 02:42:58.760]  Who would send their children to that kind of school?
[02:42:58.760 --> 02:43:03.760]  And that school, based on the photographs by the crime scene technicians from the Connecticut State Police,
[02:43:03.760 --> 02:43:09.760]  it is the filthiest, the most deplorable school that I as a principal have ever seen.
[02:43:09.760 --> 02:43:15.760]  Sure, it was only used as a cutout. It had been closed until right before they reopened it for this event.
[02:43:15.760 --> 02:43:20.760]  And that's why when I do my FOIA request, one of the things I've learned as an administrator,
[02:43:20.760 --> 02:43:25.760]  show me the work orders beginning May the 1st through December the 13th, 2012.
[02:43:25.760 --> 02:43:29.760]  Show me the custodial. Show me that there's nothing. It's a cutout.
[02:43:29.760 --> 02:43:34.760]  There's nothing. And for 15 months, Alex, the school board refuses to call me back.
[02:43:34.760 --> 02:43:40.760]  They refuse to answer the questions. I've spent over $15,000 trying to get FOIA request answered.
[02:43:40.760 --> 02:43:42.760]  And guess what? Not one response.
[02:43:42.760 --> 02:43:45.760]  Yeah, why don't they just release it and shut you up?
[02:43:45.760 --> 02:43:47.760]  I'd go away.
[02:43:47.760 --> 02:43:52.760]  You know, I don't want this to have ever happened, but I wish it was real instead of fake.
[02:43:52.760 --> 02:43:54.760]  That is 100 times more scary.
[02:43:54.760 --> 02:44:00.760]  Yeah, you know what? I agree with you right there. I wish it was real. I wish I would just go away.
[02:44:00.760 --> 02:44:05.760]  It's affecting my entire family. It's affecting my lifestyle. I do this for living.
[02:44:05.760 --> 02:44:09.760]  And you know, when people ask me, I've got to tell them the truth about what happened.
[02:44:09.760 --> 02:44:13.760]  I was a Columbine. We learned active shooter training.
[02:44:13.760 --> 02:44:16.760]  I see nothing at Sandy Hook that even remotely looks closed.
[02:44:16.760 --> 02:44:19.760]  In fact, I was looking you up. That's why you were on Good Morning American, all this stuff.
[02:44:19.760 --> 02:44:22.760]  Didn't you help develop everything we see today?
[02:44:22.760 --> 02:44:27.760]  Yes, emergency management plan. We came out with the first color-coded emergency plan.
[02:44:27.760 --> 02:44:32.760]  We sold it across the country. Even for Obama since his kids, Sidwell Friends,
[02:44:32.760 --> 02:44:36.760]  they actually bought this emergency management plan for me.
[02:44:36.760 --> 02:44:39.760]  And, I mean, now they have Secret Service, of course.
[02:44:39.760 --> 02:44:43.760]  But, I mean, I've been in a thousand different school districts all across the country.
[02:44:43.760 --> 02:44:47.760]  And, I mean, yes, coming out was something. I bet this is cut into your business.
[02:44:47.760 --> 02:44:50.760]  It has. I've actually, yeah, I've been black.
[02:44:50.760 --> 02:44:53.760]  You're the perfect witness. You've got this great record, national expert.
[02:44:53.760 --> 02:44:56.760]  You see it. You have integrity. You tell the truth.
[02:44:56.760 --> 02:44:58.760]  And I bet it got you blackballed.
[02:44:58.760 --> 02:45:01.760]  It didn't get you blackballed with God, though.
[02:45:01.760 --> 02:45:05.760]  Or with all the parents out there that appreciate you and all the gun owners that appreciate you.
[02:45:05.760 --> 02:45:11.760]  Because this was clearly their PR false-fake. Listen, Obama has been caught at least six times.
[02:45:11.760 --> 02:45:14.760]  Staging fake shootings, fake bombings, and chemical attacks.
[02:45:14.760 --> 02:45:19.760]  It's even been in the BBC that NATO and Turkey were involved staging false flags.
[02:45:19.760 --> 02:45:21.760]  This is mainstream news.
[02:45:21.760 --> 02:45:28.760]  So, if they'll stage false flags or launch a chemical attack that kills civilians to blame Assad and the army,
[02:45:28.760 --> 02:45:31.760]  would they stage something in America to get our guns?
[02:45:31.760 --> 02:45:37.760]  You'd have to be—if they'd stage fast and furious that they admit killed 2,000-plus Mexicans
[02:45:37.760 --> 02:45:41.760]  over 100 law enforcement in Mexico, at least six law enforcement in this country,
[02:45:41.760 --> 02:45:44.760]  two of them board of patrol to blame the Second Amendment.
[02:45:44.760 --> 02:45:48.760]  The CBS News found the secret documents leaked by good members of the ATF.
[02:45:48.760 --> 02:45:53.760]  If they would do that, would they stage this?
[02:45:53.760 --> 02:45:55.760]  Wolfgang.
[02:45:55.760 --> 02:46:02.760]  Can I tell you what? If we allow this to stand, and if we don't challenge it, who's going to be next?
[02:46:02.760 --> 02:46:05.760]  What are they going to do next to us?
[02:46:05.760 --> 02:46:09.760]  I think this government thinks people are not smart enough to figure it out.
[02:46:09.760 --> 02:46:14.760]  And I thank God that you're there, Alex, because you've got the voice and you can reach people.
[02:46:14.760 --> 02:46:20.760]  I'm disappointed in the NRA. I've asked them for financial help, donations, so we can follow our first civil lawsuit.
[02:46:20.760 --> 02:46:26.760]  If you were in my house today, Alex, I'll show you all the evidence that two Connecticut state troopers gave to me.
[02:46:26.760 --> 02:46:29.760]  They showed me the script they used on that day.
[02:46:29.760 --> 02:46:31.760]  They used a script.
[02:46:31.760 --> 02:46:33.760]  And there's a company—
[02:46:33.760 --> 02:46:37.760]  Let's stop right there. The amount of evidence you've gotten and you've been threatened.
[02:46:37.760 --> 02:46:40.760]  Recap the threats and then tell you what those state troopers gave you.
[02:46:40.760 --> 02:46:48.760]  Well, the threats are—I mean, you and I would never be talking if they didn't send those two homicide investigators.
[02:46:48.760 --> 02:46:50.760]  And I'm going to tell you what, they threatened me.
[02:46:50.760 --> 02:46:53.760]  They said, if I don't stop asking questions about Sandy Hook,
[02:46:53.760 --> 02:46:58.760]  they're going to be Connecticut state police were coming to my home and they're going to arrest me.
[02:46:58.760 --> 02:47:05.760]  Then I had two deputy sheriffs come to my house telling me that the Newtown police chief wants to know when I'm coming to Newtown.
[02:47:05.760 --> 02:47:08.760]  And then they ask if I want any handguns.
[02:47:08.760 --> 02:47:10.760]  I said, it's none of y'all's business.
[02:47:10.760 --> 02:47:19.760]  And then I got a phone call from the sergeant from the Southbury police department telling me that I never, ever need to call the Chapfield
[02:47:19.760 --> 02:47:26.760]  Port-a-Potty Company again and asking who ordered the Port-a-Potty's, when were they ordered and who paid for them.
[02:47:26.760 --> 02:47:29.760]  They said, stop harassing the Port-a-Potty Company.
[02:47:29.760 --> 02:47:30.760]  That's public record.
[02:47:30.760 --> 02:47:32.760]  That's paid for with taxpayer dollars.
[02:47:32.760 --> 02:47:34.760]  They're trying to block your investigation.
[02:47:34.760 --> 02:47:36.760]  Every step.
[02:47:36.760 --> 02:47:40.760]  And I think, Alex, we do have a solution and I just hope people would help me.
[02:47:40.760 --> 02:47:42.760]  I was hoping the NRA would help us.
[02:47:42.760 --> 02:47:44.760]  I was hoping Larry Leprat would step up.
[02:47:44.760 --> 02:47:48.760]  And the civil lawsuit is going to expose it.
[02:47:48.760 --> 02:47:52.760]  We're going to talk about that in the next segment, but let's get into what the state troopers gave you.
[02:47:52.760 --> 02:47:57.760]  Well, the state trooper showed me where the script is within the 11,000-page document.
[02:47:57.760 --> 02:48:06.760]  You know, the Sandy Hook Commission, the governor appointed, they actually called this 11,000-page document the biggest data dump
[02:48:06.760 --> 02:48:14.760]  that the Connecticut State Police and Stephen Sudensky, the Danbury State Attorney, they created the biggest data dump.
[02:48:14.760 --> 02:48:15.760]  It doesn't make any sense.
[02:48:15.760 --> 02:48:19.760]  You'll spend the rest of your life trying to read it to try to understand it.
[02:48:19.760 --> 02:48:23.760]  Sure, I mean, that's a tactic in depositions is a dump so much on people, they can't.
[02:48:23.760 --> 02:48:24.760]  And they did.
[02:48:24.760 --> 02:48:25.760]  And they dumped it.
[02:48:25.760 --> 02:48:31.760]  So when I flew up to Hartford, Connecticut, I met with two Connecticut troopers and they trusted me because they were in my class.
[02:48:31.760 --> 02:48:37.760]  I was their instructor in 2002 and they said, Wolfgang, we don't like what they're doing in Connecticut.
[02:48:37.760 --> 02:48:38.760]  They're corrupt.
[02:48:38.760 --> 02:48:41.760]  It's nothing but corruption in Connecticut.
[02:48:41.760 --> 02:48:42.760]  And you know what?
[02:48:42.760 --> 02:48:43.760]  They don't work up there anymore.
[02:48:43.760 --> 02:48:45.760]  They quit after we met.
[02:48:45.760 --> 02:48:46.760]  They're tired of it.
[02:48:46.760 --> 02:48:47.760]  They're scared.
[02:48:47.760 --> 02:48:51.760]  They've got families, they've got kids, but dear God, they told me about capstone.
[02:48:51.760 --> 02:48:53.760]  They told me about the scripts.
[02:48:53.760 --> 02:48:55.760]  They showed me where the evidence is.
[02:48:55.760 --> 02:49:01.760]  They showed me the pictures about Shannon Yix and how she could not have taken those pictures on that day.
[02:49:01.760 --> 02:49:07.760]  I mean, thank God these guys trusted me.
[02:49:07.760 --> 02:49:11.760]  And if you dig deeper, what else are you discovering?
[02:49:11.760 --> 02:49:22.760]  Well, again, what we're discovering is that sworn affidavits by Connecticut police officers, they're actually lying under oath.
[02:49:22.760 --> 02:49:27.760]  Now, being a former state trooper, I'm going to tell you, Alex, I would never do that.
[02:49:27.760 --> 02:49:32.760]  I am not going to put my family at risk and lie on an affidavit to please who?
[02:49:32.760 --> 02:49:34.760]  You know, I think maybe they've got immunity.
[02:49:34.760 --> 02:49:40.760]  Somebody must have done something to where these guys are so cocky, they could care less.
[02:49:40.760 --> 02:49:42.760]  They don't return phone calls.
[02:49:42.760 --> 02:49:47.760]  But I'll tell you what, there are 16 Connecticut state troopers who lie under sworn testimony.
[02:49:47.760 --> 02:49:51.760]  And I can prove that because, Alex, picture this.
[02:49:51.760 --> 02:49:58.760]  16 of them said they crawled through that shot-out glass window on December 14, 2000.
[02:49:58.760 --> 02:50:02.760]  You can see the window that nobody's crawled through it and nobody could because it was shattered glass.
[02:50:02.760 --> 02:50:03.760]  It would all fall.
[02:50:03.760 --> 02:50:04.760]  Right.
[02:50:04.760 --> 02:50:07.760]  It's 42 in the third inches high, 35 in the third wide.
[02:50:07.760 --> 02:50:10.760]  There are these SWAT teams in Connecticut.
[02:50:10.760 --> 02:50:12.760]  These are big guys with their weapons.
[02:50:12.760 --> 02:50:14.760]  Midgets couldn't go through there without knocking it down.
[02:50:14.760 --> 02:50:15.760]  All right.
[02:50:15.760 --> 02:50:16.760]  So now what do we have?
[02:50:16.760 --> 02:50:20.760]  We have 16 people with sworn affidavits who outright lie, which is a felony.
[02:50:20.760 --> 02:50:21.760]  Now, guess what?
[02:50:21.760 --> 02:50:23.760]  What do we do with that?
[02:50:23.760 --> 02:50:24.760]  We need to take them.
[02:50:24.760 --> 02:50:27.760]  This should be enough evidence to start a grand jury.
[02:50:27.760 --> 02:50:29.760]  I just need help.
[02:50:29.760 --> 02:50:30.760]  I need the voices.
[02:50:30.760 --> 02:50:31.760]  I need help.
[02:50:31.760 --> 02:50:36.760]  And now with the FBI data showing that there are no murders in Newtown.
[02:50:36.760 --> 02:50:37.760]  I mean, come on.
[02:50:37.760 --> 02:50:40.760]  This is common sense.
[02:50:40.760 --> 02:50:41.760]  Incredible.
[02:50:41.760 --> 02:50:43.760]  We're going to come back and talk about how folks can support you.
[02:50:43.760 --> 02:50:48.760]  And I do want to send some reporters up there with you as part of an investigation soon.

[02:55:04.760 --> 02:55:09.760]  Going back to Wolfgang W. Halbig, one of the top school safety experts in the country,
[02:55:09.760 --> 02:55:12.760]  who just looked at this and says the whole school is a cutout.
[02:55:12.760 --> 02:55:16.760]  It's completely staged and you've had all the other evidence to it. It's really overwhelming.
[02:55:16.760 --> 02:55:22.760]  Wolfgang, talk about how you can follow a civil lawsuit here, where your investigation is going,
[02:55:22.760 --> 02:55:30.760]  but also how people support you and how did they think they'd get away with something this big, this brazen, this obvious.
[02:55:30.760 --> 02:55:36.760]  And I think it's been a bloody nose to them and I saw national polls where a large group of people don't believe it.
[02:55:36.760 --> 02:55:43.760]  Videos all over the web with tens of millions of views, a piece in some cases, showing the evidence it's a hoax.
[02:55:43.760 --> 02:55:47.760]  I mean, I think this teaches them not to stage stuff.
[02:55:47.760 --> 02:55:56.760]  Well, now, you know, for the first time, Alex, we actually have this script and there's a company called Obsidian that works out of Washington, D.C.
[02:55:56.760 --> 02:56:03.760]  Now, that is probably one of the most powerful organizations you need to check out because they're writing all of the scripts.
[02:56:03.760 --> 02:56:11.760]  You know, whenever FEMA or Homeland Security has a major crisis or problems, Benghazi, these people are out there writing the scripts.
[02:56:11.760 --> 02:56:14.760]  Funny name, you know, Obsidian means black.
[02:56:14.760 --> 02:56:21.760]  Well, can I tell you what? Now, they're a scary group and you need to check them out. They wrote the script for Sandy Hook.
[02:56:21.760 --> 02:56:27.760]  And when you read the script, you've got lead actors, you got supporting actors.
[02:56:27.760 --> 02:56:34.760]  I mean, everything falls into place. You don't even see the chief of police, the captain and four lieutenants.
[02:56:34.760 --> 02:56:40.760]  You don't hear a word from any of those until an hour and a half into the shooting event.
[02:56:40.760 --> 02:56:46.760]  Sure. I want to be clear about Obsidian though, because I've heard of the group, but I'm not saying they've done anything.
[02:56:46.760 --> 02:56:56.760]  It is creepy. It's a black pyramid. It's their symbol. But if you expand on all this, it's like Hollywood's been asked to write scripts that the CIA later uses in real operations.
[02:56:56.760 --> 02:57:04.760]  So they're writing the main scripts and then they're getting picked up. I mean, that doesn't prove that they somehow were involved just because they wrote the script, right?
[02:57:04.760 --> 02:57:09.760]  Well, I'm not saying I can't prove that they did exactly that.
[02:57:09.760 --> 02:57:17.760]  But when you look at Obsidian, I saw their name in the 11,000 pages and that's where I tied them together.
[02:57:17.760 --> 02:57:25.760]  Now, how did the word Obsidian show up in that type of police report? I mean, it just doesn't make sense.
[02:57:25.760 --> 02:57:28.760]  It's a super creepy name, super creepy symbol.
[02:57:28.760 --> 02:57:33.760]  Well, when you look at it, when you look at management staff of Obsidian, that's a powerful group of people.
[02:57:33.760 --> 02:57:39.760]  They're pictures are posted, they're backgrounds. That is a very powerful group.
[02:57:39.760 --> 02:57:46.760]  Well, I know this. I've seen CNN and others run hoaxes. I've seen the White House do it and it's getting more blatant.
[02:57:46.760 --> 02:57:50.760]  So I think something would be wrong with us not to question all these.
[02:57:50.760 --> 02:58:01.760]  And then you look at the green screens and just the lies and the fake videos and you're really sure, though, nobody died. It was a total cutout.
[02:58:01.760 --> 02:58:04.760]  I'm telling you, nobody died.
[02:58:04.760 --> 02:58:10.760]  And you know why I'm going to tell you this. I've been a school administrator for 30-some-odd years.
[02:58:10.760 --> 02:58:19.760]  When I have a child with a broken arm or I've got a fight on the school bus or a child's been stabbed or shot, the first thing we get ready for are lawsuits.
[02:58:19.760 --> 02:58:27.760]  Alex, if there would have been just two or three lawsuits filed by the parents or loved ones who lost someone that day at Sandy Hook, I'd go away.
[02:58:27.760 --> 02:58:32.760]  Oh, there'd be 100 lawsuits right now. I didn't even think of that. There's no lawsuits.
[02:58:32.760 --> 02:58:37.760]  It's like a Manhattan Project simulation hoax. I only have five more minutes.

[02:59:17.760 --> 02:59:18.760]  DNA force.
[02:59:18.760 --> 02:59:22.760]  The government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo.
[02:59:22.760 --> 02:59:26.760]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[02:59:26.760 --> 02:59:33.760]  Can you put two and two together? Infidel body armor can stop every round, including hollow points and 308 sniper rounds.
[02:59:33.760 --> 02:59:40.760]  It's reasonably priced and fully legal. But for how long? Go to infidelbodyarmor.com.

[03:00:05.760 --> 03:00:13.760]  Big Brother. Mainstream media. Government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does he.
[03:00:13.760 --> 03:00:21.760]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[03:00:21.760 --> 03:00:28.760]  Seeing it, Mitch, they did fake scut attacks on themselves back in 1991, 1990.
[03:00:28.760 --> 03:00:38.760]  Would they stage this? I don't know. The penguins live in Antarctica?
[03:00:38.760 --> 03:00:43.760]  Wolfgang W. Halbig's our guest, former state police officer, then worked for the customs department.
[03:00:43.760 --> 03:00:48.760]  And then over the last decades, created one of the biggest, most successful school safety training grips.
[03:00:48.760 --> 03:00:53.760]  And he just has gone and investigated, and it's as funny as a $3 bill, and they've been...
[03:00:53.760 --> 03:00:59.760]  Man, Wolfgang, you dropped a bombshell of your scores of points, your 16 questions.
[03:00:59.760 --> 03:01:06.760]  If you've got a school of 100 kids, and then nobody can find them, and then you've got parents laughing,
[03:01:06.760 --> 03:01:13.760]  and then they walk over to the camera and go, not just one, but a bunch of parents doing this.
[03:01:13.760 --> 03:01:16.760]  And then photos of kids that are still alive, they said, died.
[03:01:16.760 --> 03:01:22.760]  I mean, they think we're so dumb that it's really hidden in plain view.
[03:01:22.760 --> 03:01:29.760]  So the preponderance, I thought they had some scripting early on to exacerbate and milk the crisis, as Rahm Emanuel said.
[03:01:29.760 --> 03:01:35.760]  But when you really look at it, where are the lawsuits? There would be incredible lawsuits and payouts,
[03:01:35.760 --> 03:01:42.760]  but there haven't been any filed, nothing. I've never seen this. This is incredible.
[03:01:42.760 --> 03:01:47.760]  Alex, just the medical negligence all by itself, the lack of trauma helicopters.
[03:01:47.760 --> 03:01:53.760]  You know, they did not allow... Listen, this is in their transcript. This is in their sworn affidavits.
[03:01:53.760 --> 03:02:00.760]  They never allowed the paramedics or into EMTs ever inside the school.
[03:02:00.760 --> 03:02:05.760]  Why would you not allow paramedics in there? These are somebody's children.
[03:02:05.760 --> 03:02:14.760]  They're clinging to life, and nobody wants to let the paramedics in. Who did that?
[03:02:14.760 --> 03:02:20.760]  And I guess they just picked a group of state police and others that they knew they had under their control, compromised.
[03:02:20.760 --> 03:02:25.760]  I don't know, you know, pro-gun controllers, fellow travelers.
[03:02:25.760 --> 03:02:31.760]  I mean, that's the only sticking point is that they can get so many people to engage in a criminal operation.
[03:02:31.760 --> 03:02:33.760]  But historically, it happens.
[03:02:33.760 --> 03:02:39.760]  Well, you know, when you write a script, and if you don't understand how we work in a public education system,
[03:02:39.760 --> 03:02:46.760]  that's where the script writers grew up. Alex, at 10.35.23, please read the document.
[03:02:46.760 --> 03:02:55.760]  It's not what I say. At 10.35, you can hear 405 on the transmission calling emergency services.
[03:02:55.760 --> 03:03:04.760]  He is now requesting that every paramedic and EMT bring their defibrillators to the Sandy Hook Elementary School.
[03:03:04.760 --> 03:03:10.760]  And that's an hour after the shooting. Now, why would they need defibrillators an hour after the shooting,
[03:03:10.760 --> 03:03:15.760]  and the children have already been declared dead within 11 minutes? Why are they requesting defibrillators?
[03:03:15.760 --> 03:03:17.760]  They didn't do the script in order.
[03:03:17.760 --> 03:03:20.760]  They screwed up. They're not talking to each other.
[03:03:20.760 --> 03:03:27.760]  Well, listen, I know they script stuff, because they announced Building 7 had been blown up and fallen on CNN and two BBCs.
[03:03:27.760 --> 03:03:31.760]  And then I even researched who they get their scripts from. It's Reuters.
[03:03:31.760 --> 03:03:36.760]  And then later, they had to admit, yes, Reuters told us Building 7 had fallen in its own footprint,
[03:03:36.760 --> 03:03:41.760]  and they announced it. They got time zones scrambled.
[03:03:41.760 --> 03:03:44.760]  I mean, it's just incredible. It's incredible.
[03:03:44.760 --> 03:03:49.760]  Alex, my dear friend, I want you to be in that room where we get the first deposition.
[03:03:49.760 --> 03:03:54.760]  I want you to look at the person that we're going to go after, and you're going to be amazed,
[03:03:54.760 --> 03:03:57.760]  and I think you can share that with all of you listeners.
[03:03:57.760 --> 03:04:03.760]  I mean, you're a great voice out there, but you need to be a part of being in part of that room in the deposition.
[03:04:03.760 --> 03:04:05.760]  You'll be amazed.
[03:04:05.760 --> 03:04:07.760]  How long until you do this lawsuit?
[03:04:07.760 --> 03:04:11.760]  Well, it depends on the funding. These attorneys want, you know, money's up front.
[03:04:11.760 --> 03:04:16.760]  I've already spent $15,000. I'm going to file it anyway. I don't care what.
[03:04:16.760 --> 03:04:22.760]  I'm going to finish this. They shouldn't have come to my house, and I'm not going to stop.
[03:04:22.760 --> 03:04:25.760]  I'm just not going to stop.
[03:04:25.760 --> 03:04:27.760]  So they made a mistake pushing you.
[03:04:27.760 --> 03:04:31.760]  They should not come to my house. They shouldn't have threatened me right before Christmas.
[03:04:31.760 --> 03:04:36.760]  You scared my family. I mean, you've got to be kidding me. I'm a former state trooper.
[03:04:36.760 --> 03:04:39.760]  I would never do that to you.
[03:04:39.760 --> 03:04:43.760]  Well, that's what tyrants always do. They push a little too far and find out.
[03:04:43.760 --> 03:04:50.760]  People weren't scared. We were just reserved, and then the boys from the men are separated,
[03:04:50.760 --> 03:04:52.760]  and the thugs always fall.
[03:04:52.760 --> 03:04:56.760]  Sandyhookjustice.com. Folks, get in there and help this investigation, fund it.
[03:04:56.760 --> 03:05:25.760]  Wolfgang, we'll talk to you soon.
