[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]  We interrupt this broadcast with a special report from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.000]  Attempts have been made to neutralize the InfoWarrior known as Alex Jones.
[00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000]  Countless attacks have been witnessed and reported in an effort to bring him down.
[00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:29.000]  Alex Jones has been sighted on the battlefield fighting against the forces of evil.
[00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.000]  We're receiving reports that Alex Jones has broken through the front lines and is now heading toward the broadcast studio.
[00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000]  All efforts to silence him have failed.
[00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000]  Emerging victorious against the New World Order, here's your host.
[00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:57.000]  Alex Jones. Find the InfoWars transmission at InfoWars.com forward slash show.
[00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000]  If you're receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:13.000]  The year is 1995 and InfoWars launches the last of America's counter globalist probes.
[00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:19.000]  In a freak mishap, InfoWars.com and Alex Jones are blown out of their trajectory
[00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:27.000]  into an orbit which freezes his life support systems and returns Alex Jones to Earth 25 years later.
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000]  Transdimensionally over the space-time continuum through full specs.
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000]  Where people are extremely lazy, the social engineers are there laughing.
[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000]  What we envisioned 100 years ago, 20 years ago, is now reality.
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.000]  While the society unravels, men run around totally frantic not knowing how to be men
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:47.000]  and women run around frantic not knowing how to be women
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.000]  and they don't understand that it's an animating contest of life
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.000]  and that it's fulfilling to be informed, it's fulfilling to be involved, it's fulfilling.
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000]  InfoWars, tomorrow's news, today.
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000]  Hello Americans, I'm Paul Harvey.
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:10.000]  If I were the devil, if I were the prince of darkness, I'd want to engulf the whole world in darkness
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000]  and I'd have a third of its real estate and four-fifths of its population
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.000]  but I wouldn't be happy until I had seized the ripest apple on the tree.
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.000]  Me.
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000]  So I set about however necessary to take over the United States.
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000]  President Kennedy has been seriously wounded by this shooting.
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000]  I'd subvert the churches first, I'd begin with a campaign of whispers.
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.000]  With the wisdom of the serpent I would whisper to you as I whispered to Eve, do as you please.
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.000]  To the young I would whisper that the Bible is a myth.
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.000]  I would convince them that man created God instead of the other way around.
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.000]  I would confide that what's bad is good and what's good is square.
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:51.000]  And the old I would teach to pray after me, our father, which art in Washington.
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:53.000]  And then I'd get organized.
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000]  I'd educate authors in how to make lurid literature exciting
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000]  so that anything else would appear dull and uninteresting.
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000]  I'd threaten TV with dirtier movies and vice versa.
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:04.000]  I'd peddle narcotics to whom I could.
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000]  I'd sell alcohol to ladies and gentlemen of distinction.
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000]  I'd tranquilize the rest with pills.
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.000]  If I were the devil I'd soon have families at war with themselves,
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.000]  churches at war with themselves and nations at war with themselves
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000]  until each in its turn was consumed.
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:27.000]  And with promises of higher ratings I'd have mesmerizing media banning the flame.
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.000]  The president of the United States is racist.
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000]  If I were the devil I would encourage schools to refine young intellects
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000]  but neglect to discipline emotions just one dose one while.
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000]  Within a decade I'd have prisons overflowing,
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000]  I'd have judges promoting pornography.
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.000]  Soon I could evict God from the courthouse, then from the schoolhouse,
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:49.000]  and then from the houses of Congress.
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.000]  And in his own churches I would substitute psychology for religion.
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:59.000]  I would lure priests and pastors into misusing boys and girls and church money.
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.000]  If I were the devil I'd take from those who have and give to those who wanted
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000]  until I had killed the incentive of the ambitious.
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000]  I would caution against extremes.
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.000]  Lord people, you keep telling me to shut up. This isn't a game.
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.000]  In hard work, in patriotism, in moral conduct,
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000]  I would convince the young that marriage is old-fashioned,
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:25.000]  that swinging is more fun, that what you see on TV is the way to be.
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:27.000]  And thus I could undress you in public,
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:33.000]  and I could lure you into bed with diseases for which there is no cure.
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.000]  In other words, if I were the devil I'd just keep right on doing what he's doing.
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:05:00.000]  Now you know the rest of the story.
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.000]  I've studied how the globalists, how the mad scientists are controlling us,
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.000]  and they're doing it by keeping us undernourished.
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.000]  You can eat all the food you want in the world,
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:15.000]  put down the essential vitamins and minerals in an organic, absorbable form.
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:17.000]  If you don't have the key elements like iodine,
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:22.000]  you are literally like someone in a paddle boat without ores, without paddles.
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are running a flash sale,
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:28.000]  because we're about to sell out of both of these,
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:34.000]  of X3 and vitaminal fusion in the final days of August.
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.000]  This is a fundraiser. We'll sell out of this.
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:39.000]  I can sell it at full price.
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.000]  But I want those of you that have been on the fence
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.000]  and never tried X3 or never tried vitaminal fusion
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:46.000]  to take action and try this product,
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.000]  because I know you're going to be blown away
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:53.000]  by the energy, the stamina, the focus, the libido.
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:55.000]  This is so critical.
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:00.000]  Get your X3 and vitaminal fusion for 40% off right now at m4store.com.
[00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:19.000]  Infowars. Tomorrow's news today.
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.000]  And it's time for humanity to stand up in the Infowars
[00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.000]  and say, I don't know what's going to happen at the end of this,
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:37.000]  but you want to fight? You better believe you've got one!
[00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:44.000]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:07.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, it's Friday, August 25th, 2023.
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.000]  We're going to have open phones throughout the broadcast
[00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.000]  and a ton of incredibly important news, as always.
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:18.000]  If you're a TV viewer, there it is, the mugshot of mugshots in history.
[00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:23.000]  The fourth raft of indictments turning himself in in Atlanta yesterday.
[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:29.000]  And look at the look on his face there.
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.000]  Nothing but pure determination.
[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:36.000]  Regardless what you think of Trump, you can't help but admire his
[00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:45.000]  staunchness, his will to persevere.
[00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:48.000]  He is certainly dauntless.
[00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:53.000]  I think of myself as dauntless and our crew is dogged and persevering,
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.000]  but man, I tell you, Trump takes the cake.
[00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:02.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, we've all had our share of persecution at the hands
[00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.000]  of the CIA and the globalists that are now out in the open
[00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.000]  in a coup against our country, against our elections.
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:13.000]  And Biden, as I told you, they're announcing plans to restrict and ban beef.
[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.000]  And 14 cities are banning beef outright.
[00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:20.000]  Biden's also announcing a plan to restrict alcohol sales
[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.000]  through an ID system that New York's already starting.
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:25.000]  So that's just the social credit score.
[00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.000]  It always starts with something like alcohol and tobacco.
[00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:32.000]  But of course, then it's your vaccine records, your political record.
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:36.000]  It's all about the social credit score.
[00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:41.000]  So we're going to be looking at what happened in Georgia yesterday,
[00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:45.000]  and we have put into production today,
[00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.000]  and they're going on sale as we speak at m4store.com
[00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.000]  to fund the operation and to get the word out,
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.000]  two different variants of a new Trump shirt.
[00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:57.000]  We already put out one when he was supposedly going to be mugshot before,
[00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:01.000]  but they were smart in New York and didn't want to give him that political iconic image.
[00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:03.000]  It really backfires on them.
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:07.000]  So they didn't do one because they do whatever they want.
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:11.000]  So we put out one. It's a designer collector shirt.
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:14.000]  When those are gone, there's gone. There's only like 500 left.
[00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:17.000]  But the two new shirts are the real mugshot
[00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:20.000]  and say never surrender on the back m4store.com.
[00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:24.000]  On the front, political prisoner with an image of President Trump.
[00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:26.000]  And those shirts are being made right now.
[00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.000]  You can order them right now at m4store.com.
[00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:31.000]  They're a limited edition shirt.
[00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:35.000]  We're printing 5,000 of them, and that's it.
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:37.000]  When they're gone, they're gone.
[00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:40.000]  All new shirts we do, it's important for folks to know,
[00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.000]  are limited edition, high quality designer shirts.
[00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:45.000]  And when they're gone, they're gone.
[00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:49.000]  So as we speak, that'll be on the shopping cart at m4store.com.
[00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:54.000]  Also, this weekend is the end of the August super sale.
[00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:56.000]  Christmas comes in August.
[00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:59.000]  So that means all the gigantic discounts,
[00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:01.000]  the sales as big as a Christmas sale, as big as they get,
[00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:03.000]  will be ending this weekend,
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:05.000]  because so many of the products are almost sold out.
[00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:09.000]  The sale that will continue on for a few days in the next week
[00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:15.000]  is the X3 and vitamin mineral fusion flash sale
[00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:18.000]  for 40% off and double Patriot points,
[00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:20.000]  but that will be ending as well.
[00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:22.000]  Those are both amazing products,
[00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:24.000]  and it is your funds that keep us on air,
[00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:26.000]  so I want to thank you for that.
[00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:28.000]  But what's having the big effect out there
[00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:30.000]  is you taking clips of the show
[00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:34.000]  and sharing the clips is really having a massive effect,
[00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:36.000]  and it's changing public opinion,
[00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:38.000]  not just here, but around the world.
[00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:44.000]  It was last Friday that, together,
[00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:48.000]  we were able to push the big story out
[00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:50.000]  based on my whistleblowers
[00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:52.000]  that were about to roll out the COVID restrictions,
[00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:55.000]  and then we rang a dinner bell or something.
[00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:57.000]  That night, the whole thing was already pre-planned.
[00:10:58.000 --> 00:10:59.000]  We didn't know that.
[00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:01.000]  A couple of weeks rolled it out,
[00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:06.000]  and so now there is major pushback in Congress
[00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:09.000]  and in the governorships and by the people
[00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:15.000]  as they attempt to roll those restrictions back out
[00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:18.000]  so they can have mail-in ballots coming up next year,
[00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:21.000]  which helped them steal, was critical in helping them
[00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:26.000]  clinch the theft of the 2020 election.
[00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:29.000]  But again, it's Friday, August 25, 2023.
[00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:31.000]  For TV viewers, you see it, mugshot,
[00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:33.000]  45th president of the United States,
[00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:37.000]  August 24, 2023, when they took the photo last night,
[00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:41.000]  and let this sink in for just a minute.
[00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:47.000]  You have all the incredible crimes of Biden and his son
[00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:51.000]  and of the globalist and of Big Pharma and of Fauci
[00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:54.000]  and of Bill Gates and the human smuggling
[00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:57.000]  and the hundreds of thousands of fentanyl deaths
[00:11:58.000 --> 00:11:59.000]  and just the destruction of the blue cities
[00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:03.000]  and states and the exodus out of their collapsing systems
[00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:06.000]  as Biden cuts off our energy supplies
[00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:11.000]  and finances, defunding of police operations.
[00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:14.000]  You have Hunter now, it turns out,
[00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:16.000]  involved in a whole bunch of other new crimes
[00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:18.000]  we're discovering we'll be talking about,
[00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:21.000]  but the system knows that they're above the law
[00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:26.000]  and they are flaunting all of this arrogantly in our face.
[00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:29.000]  We'll be breaking all of that down
[00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:36.000]  but I gotta tell you, since the tragic Maui fires
[00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:40.000]  a few weeks ago, we now have a crystal clear picture
[00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:43.000]  of exactly what happened.
[00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:48.000]  And in the third hour today,
[00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:53.000]  I'm gonna do a deep dive after we take calls on this,
[00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:55.000]  but it is incredible.
[00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:57.000]  And the reason the local newspapers
[00:12:58.000 --> 00:12:59.000]  and the Associated Press and others
[00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:01.000]  have found out the truth,
[00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:04.000]  that the police barricaded the people under orders
[00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:07.000]  into the town even though the road was wide open
[00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:10.000]  and watched them burn up and die
[00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:15.000]  under orders that indeed that is what killed
[00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:17.000]  the majority of the people.
[00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:19.000]  So they didn't just cut the water off,
[00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:21.000]  they didn't just leave the power on,
[00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:25.000]  they didn't just not trim the trees around the power poles,
[00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:28.000]  they didn't just not turn the alarm on,
[00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:31.000]  all of that, they confirm, and now it's on video,
[00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:35.000]  not just eyewitnesses, murdered the people
[00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:38.000]  that weren't able to go down alleys and side streets
[00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:41.000]  and that didn't have off-road vehicles.
[00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:45.000]  And some got stuck but still were able to run to the ocean.
[00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:49.000]  So this is default bureaucratic murder
[00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:53.000]  to get the most expensive land in the United States.
[00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:57.000]  This was pre-planned, they wanted the people dead.
[00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:00.000]  So that they couldn't stand up for their property
[00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:03.000]  and simply were easily taken from them.
[00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:05.000]  Now I'm not saying the police themselves
[00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:07.000]  were conscious of this.
[00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:09.000]  They followed orders, they've now talked to the press
[00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:12.000]  and they said, we were told, they don't say about who,
[00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:14.000]  to do this.
[00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:17.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, we've got a bunch of videos now,
[00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:20.000]  not just of what Fish said a week and a half ago,
[00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:24.000]  the well-known old man that lives on the street
[00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:27.000]  but he works on the street, lives on a small farm,
[00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:31.000]  he leaves hats and sells them.
[00:14:31.104 --> 00:14:40.264]  Now some of the people out of the thousand plus that didn't make it out that did get
[00:14:40.264 --> 00:14:48.184]  out have now uploaded their videos and it is the police ordering them to stay there.
[00:14:48.184 --> 00:14:53.024]  Now I've also been criticized, I noticed quite a bit on Twitter, that I'm covering up direct
[00:14:53.024 --> 00:14:54.984]  energy weapons and space lasers.
[00:14:54.984 --> 00:14:57.784]  Hey, Greg Reese has done reports on that.
[00:14:57.784 --> 00:15:07.624]  We've had a lot of other guests on that have talked about it, like Stu Peters and of course
[00:15:07.624 --> 00:15:10.664]  Mr. White and others.
[00:15:10.664 --> 00:15:14.744]  And I think it's reasonable to look at that and it's reasonable to discuss that and direct
[00:15:14.744 --> 00:15:21.064]  energy weapons are a real thing but if you look at California and you look at Hawaii,
[00:15:21.064 --> 00:15:25.944]  they are both run by leftists and controlled by BlackRock who owns the majority of those
[00:15:25.944 --> 00:15:35.264]  power companies including 90% of the power company that delivers 98% of the power in Maui
[00:15:35.264 --> 00:15:40.424]  and they admit they didn't trim the trees back, they admit they left the power on and we have
[00:15:40.424 --> 00:15:45.144]  the power lines falling in the wind and catching fire video after video.
[00:15:45.144 --> 00:15:49.104]  So we know they did it, we know they blockaded them in, now you know who gave
[00:15:49.104 --> 00:15:52.544]  the orders so they can be indicted and arrested.
[00:15:52.544 --> 00:15:54.344]  You know it goes all the way to the top of BlackRock.
[00:15:54.344 --> 00:15:56.064]  This is administrative mass murder.
[00:15:56.064 --> 00:15:57.064]  We'll be right back.
[00:16:24.344 --> 00:16:29.984]  We are running a flash sale, because we're about to sell out of both of these, of X3
[00:16:29.984 --> 00:16:33.744]  and Vibramental Fusion in the final days of August.

[00:19:56.544 --> 00:20:06.624]  fund our operation. Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order it's Alex Jones
[00:20:08.620 --> 00:20:38.620]  While other networks lie to you about what's happening now, InfoWars tells you the truth about what's happening next. Visit infowars.com forward slash show and share the link today.
[00:20:38.620 --> 00:21:07.620]  The entire broadcast today for Hernandez is going to tell us the fourth hour you're visiting. Always informative, always dynamic. I am really stunned to my core by Maui. And I'm going to spend almost the entire third hour on it and play these devastating clips of people trapped with the police not letting them out with the fire behind them. And we have the eyewitnesses that it was totally clear on the highway.
[00:21:08.620 --> 00:21:32.620]  to get out. And people had such trust in the system they sat there and burned to death. Now obviously the police, they've told the witnesses this, well we're told under orders you can't leave with fire behind them. That is what following orders will get you into. And that is horrifying.
[00:21:32.620 --> 00:22:01.620]  So I'm going to say it again. We know how the fire started. We know who owned the system. We know who didn't trim the trees. We know who cut off the water. We know the two emergency managers of the state and the county were both meeting on another island in Hawaii while this was all going on. We know they've got a 12 mile exclusion zone. We know FEMA is having people arrested. There's videos of that trying to videotape or take photos.
[00:22:01.620 --> 00:22:24.620]  Even locals, just like the feds tried to cover up what happened at Waco when they burned them out. This has happened. This was administratively done and the fact that they would pull something like this and get away with something like this is just staggering that they're this arrogant.
[00:22:25.800 --> 00:22:55.800]  And if we just sit here and let them sweep us under the rug, none of us are safe. We're all necks if they get away with La Hina.
[00:22:55.800 --> 00:23:11.800]  And I am staggered by it. Rob Duke came over to my house at 8 a.m. this morning and we shot a 30-minute report on this that he's going to add a lot of documents and videos to that we'll put out tomorrow.
[00:23:11.800 --> 00:23:31.800]  I also shot a report for Steven Crowder's great outfit, jonescrowder.com. It's part of his operation. That'll be up in a few hours dealing with depopulation and the documents and the quotes and a deep dive on that. So I'm a busy beaver.
[00:23:32.800 --> 00:23:39.800]  It's become somewhat of an Internet situation as well. We just get this out of the way.
[00:23:39.800 --> 00:23:46.800]  That is Alex Jones have covered and I took to come and test. I do not have covered.
[00:23:46.800 --> 00:23:59.800]  I have laryngitis and it is a combination of allergies and taking up cigar smoking again.
[00:23:59.800 --> 00:24:12.800]  Great people like Gary Haben give me boxes of hand rolled custom Cuban cigars that are the most delicious, sweet, smelling, tasting things on Earth.
[00:24:12.800 --> 00:24:23.800]  And he just gave me like 20 more of the evil things. And I have a problem with inhaling cigar smoke.
[00:24:23.800 --> 00:24:39.800]  I'll kick 90 percent out of it out, but I'll suck a little in and shoot it out my nose. And there's nothing better than a Cuban cigar and a glass of whiskey on the rocks.
[00:24:39.800 --> 00:24:44.800]  And so I am giving away the Cuban cigars today to the rest of the crew.
[00:24:45.800 --> 00:24:54.800]  Already, most of them have been given away. Still got about 15 left. I don't like giving them away because they are the most delicious things ever.
[00:24:54.800 --> 00:25:01.800]  But these these he's a billionaire and these great patriot and these fellow Texan.
[00:25:01.800 --> 00:25:07.800]  And these are the best hand rolled in Cuba that he gets. And it's just my favorite cigar.
[00:25:07.800 --> 00:25:10.800]  And I've just got to get rid of them. So this is all self-inflicted here.
[00:25:10.800 --> 00:25:20.800]  Ladies and gentlemen. I smoked a big old fat one when I interviewed Andrew Tate, and it just makes the show go by so much better.
[00:25:20.800 --> 00:25:26.800]  I didn't have any whiskey, but a nice cup of coffee. See, now I'm lusting after the cigars.
[00:25:26.800 --> 00:25:32.800]  Lord, please. Why did you put something this good on Earth that's so bad if we weren't supposed to do it?
[00:25:33.800 --> 00:25:39.800]  But again, most cigars are OK. But man, when you get. Tell you what, will somebody go get me one off my desk?
[00:25:39.800 --> 00:25:42.800]  There's a whole bag of them in there. I'll hand them out to you guys if you like cigars.
[00:25:42.800 --> 00:25:45.800]  I like saying they're evil and bad. I'm going to be on the cruise like, yes, we want them. We want them.
[00:25:45.800 --> 00:25:51.800]  I think my office store is open or just go open it up and bring these to bring these little devils in here.
[00:25:51.800 --> 00:25:56.800]  And I'm going to give the rest of them away right now because I'm actually want to fire one up right now.
[00:25:56.800 --> 00:26:01.800]  And that's not a good idea. Excuse me, folks. We've got a lot of really heavy news.
[00:26:01.800 --> 00:26:07.800]  And the end of the republic, as we know it, is looking more and more like a foregone conclusion.
[00:26:07.800 --> 00:26:23.800]  And I start waxing on waxing eloquently or trying to wax eloquently on the sweetest cigars ever.
[00:26:23.800 --> 00:26:30.800]  But I I digress, ladies and gentlemen. And just wanted to.
[00:26:30.800 --> 00:26:34.800]  Let you know that we're going to open the phones up on any item or any topic you want to cover.
[00:26:34.800 --> 00:26:40.800]  I am not idling my engine here for lack of news. And quite frankly, it's all so insane.
[00:26:40.800 --> 00:26:45.800]  So over the top, confirming everything the globalists said they were going to do decades ago.
[00:26:45.800 --> 00:26:49.800]  You see, this is not things Alex Jones said are coming true.
[00:26:49.800 --> 00:26:53.800]  This is what the New World Order said they would do is coming true.
[00:26:53.800 --> 00:26:57.800]  And that's an important distinction because.
[00:26:57.800 --> 00:27:03.800]  They're going to carry out the forced depopulation of 90 percent of us and their time frame is 20, 30.
[00:27:03.800 --> 00:27:07.800]  And they have their surrogates all over the news.
[00:27:07.800 --> 00:27:12.800]  Telling us that it's the end of the world.
[00:27:12.800 --> 00:27:19.800]  As we know it. And that it's our fault that all the systems are breaking down while they deliberately go down the line,
[00:27:19.800 --> 00:27:31.800]  turning the civilization, the civilizational infrastructure off in front of us and everything else flows downstream from that.
[00:27:31.800 --> 00:27:37.800]  But that's the the fount of it. BlackRock with 15.
[00:27:37.800 --> 00:27:47.800]  Trillion dollars. In liquid assets, they've got quadrillions leveraged and they control almost every major CEO,
[00:27:47.800 --> 00:27:52.800]  almost every major pension fund, and they get up on TV and say, we're going to control every aspect of your life.
[00:27:52.800 --> 00:27:59.800]  We're going to break your families up. We're going to make bugs and we're going to, you know, do all of this.
[00:27:59.800 --> 00:28:06.800]  And it's their policies that can destroy any company they want that doesn't get in line with the ESG.
[00:28:06.800 --> 00:28:12.800]  So they may be getting rid of the name ESG because people woke up to it, but the same ESG system is here.
[00:28:12.800 --> 00:28:22.800]  And here's an example. Elon Musk is being sued by the Justice Department because he is refusing to hire illegal aliens.
[00:28:22.800 --> 00:28:30.800]  He'll hire foreigners. They've got visas. But he's not hiring people that aren't here legally.
[00:28:30.800 --> 00:28:35.800]  I mean, you see whether hiring illegal aliens to be police in Illinois now.
[00:28:35.800 --> 00:28:43.800]  So it's just crazy how much control these monsters already have over us at every level of our lives.
[00:28:43.800 --> 00:28:49.800]  All right. We're going to come back and just go through all the news and take your phone calls.
[00:28:49.800 --> 00:28:58.800]  We'll do the deep dive on Trump and what just happened in Georgia.
[00:28:59.800 --> 00:29:07.800]  I've studied how the globalists, how the mad scientists are controlling us and they're doing it by keeping us undernourished.
[00:29:07.800 --> 00:29:14.800]  You can eat all the food you want in the world, but if you don't have the essential vitamins and minerals in an organic, absorbable form,
[00:29:14.800 --> 00:29:22.800]  if you don't have the key elements like iodine, you are literally like someone in a paddle boat without ores, without paddles.
[00:29:22.800 --> 00:29:33.800]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are running a flash sale because we're about to sell out of both of these, of X3 and vitamin fusion in the final days of August.
[00:29:33.800 --> 00:29:38.800]  This is a fundraiser. We'll sell out of this. I could sell it at full price.
[00:29:38.800 --> 00:29:45.800]  But I want those of you that have been on the fence and never tried X3 or never tried vitamin fusion to take action and try this product,
[00:29:45.800 --> 00:29:53.800]  because I know you're going to be blown away by the energy, the stamina, the focus, the libido. This is so critical.
[00:29:53.800 --> 00:29:58.800]  Get your X3 and vitamin fusion for 40% off right now and at forestore.com.
[00:29:58.800 --> 00:30:02.800]  Alex Jones here in the next 60 seconds with some very exciting announcements.

[00:31:18.800 --> 00:31:23.800]  But the problem today is finding fish without a high mercury content.

[00:32:54.800 --> 00:32:57.800]  In some cases, they add the water supply like fluoride.
[00:33:00.800 --> 00:33:06.800]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order. It's Alex Jones.
[00:33:08.710 --> 00:33:20.270]  While other networks lie to you about what's happening now, InfoWars tells you the truth
[00:33:20.270 --> 00:33:29.710]  about what's happening next. Visit infowars.com forward slash show and share the link today.
[00:33:29.710 --> 00:33:43.110]  All right, it's Friday, 30 something minutes into the broadcast, August 25th, 2023. And
[00:33:43.110 --> 00:33:45.590]  I'm going to run through a bunch of the news right now and then give the number out and
[00:33:45.590 --> 00:33:55.230]  take your phone calls. So we have the iconic mugshot. We have Trump, energized, defiant,
[00:33:55.230 --> 00:34:02.110]  pointing out that this is total election meddling. This is how the Democrat deep state conducts
[00:34:02.110 --> 00:34:11.630]  their campaigning and everything that they accuse Trump of. They themselves are now doing
[00:34:11.630 --> 00:34:13.990]  shares of Trump talking about it.
[00:34:13.990 --> 00:34:24.950]  I believe this is a very sad day for America. This should never happen. If you challenge
[00:34:24.950 --> 00:34:28.830]  an election, you should be able to challenge an election. I thought the election was a
[00:34:28.830 --> 00:34:33.430]  rigged election, a stolen election, and I should have every right to do that. As you
[00:34:33.430 --> 00:34:37.110]  know, you have many people that you've been watching over the years do the same thing,
[00:34:37.110 --> 00:34:43.270]  whether it's Hillary Clinton or Stacey Abrams or many others. When you have that great
[00:34:43.270 --> 00:34:47.390]  freedom to challenge, you have to be able to otherwise you could have very dishonest
[00:34:47.390 --> 00:34:48.390]  elections.
[00:34:48.390 --> 00:34:52.110]  What has taken place here is a travesty of justice. We did nothing wrong. I did
[00:34:52.110 --> 00:34:56.990]  nothing wrong and everybody knows that I've never had such support. And that goes with
[00:34:56.990 --> 00:35:00.870]  the other ones too. What they're doing is election interference. They're trying to
[00:35:00.870 --> 00:35:06.230]  interfere with an election. There's never been anything like it in our country before.
[00:35:06.230 --> 00:35:10.750]  This is their way of campaigning. And this is one instance, but you have three other
[00:35:10.750 --> 00:35:17.350]  instances. It's election interference.
[00:35:17.350 --> 00:35:24.790]  It's naked open election interference. They have indicted him federally and at the state
[00:35:24.790 --> 00:35:35.730]  level in DC and in Georgia for doing what they themselves have done. And it's just
[00:35:35.730 --> 00:35:42.870]  the beginning. They now go on government state run media like MSNBC and CNN. That's what
[00:35:42.870 --> 00:35:50.730]  it is. And you notice they say, Oh, we're going to set up Homeland Security to go after
[00:35:50.730 --> 00:35:58.090]  Trump supporters. They're the new terrorists. They're the new enemy. The very definition
[00:35:58.090 --> 00:36:04.930]  of living in a North Korean or communist, Chinese or Hitlerian type state update Trump
[00:36:04.930 --> 00:36:16.370]  hires lawyer who got rapper Gunna out of prison in the YSL Rico case. Some Mongo fans
[00:36:16.370 --> 00:36:22.590]  think at pro-Trump rally outside of the Atlanta jails and FBI set up NBC news. No, what people
[00:36:22.590 --> 00:36:27.790]  are saying is be careful when you go to any of these Trump events, which you should
[00:36:27.790 --> 00:36:32.310]  go to and have your cameras out and watch out for Ray Epps types. That's what we're
[00:36:32.310 --> 00:36:35.990]  saying. And the idea that that isn't a threat is preposterous.
[00:36:35.990 --> 00:36:46.230]  Look at this news. Federal judge says Texas can't reject mail ballots with wrong
[00:36:46.230 --> 00:36:54.190]  voter ID. Judges have also been ruling around the country, both Republican and Democrat.
[00:36:54.810 --> 00:37:23.810]  That postmarked ballots that came in after the law says you can have ballots will be accepted in Pennsylvania, in Georgia, in Michigan, in Arizona. All the key battleground states yet again. Isn't that interesting?
[00:37:24.810 --> 00:37:42.810]  Total complete, absolute election meddling. Let's play a few more of these clips. Let's play CNN putting his inmate number up on the chyron. Play clip 13.
[00:37:43.810 --> 00:38:02.810]  And by the way, sorry, this is the inmate number for the former president of the United States. P 0 1 1 3 5 8 0 9. Former president of the United States has an inmate number. And it's P 0 1 1 3 5 8 0 9.
[00:38:02.810 --> 00:38:10.810]  And I think it's a good reminder of what Van was saying. I think it's worth pausing here now that we have been through four of these arraignments, indictments that our system has held up.
[00:38:10.810 --> 00:38:24.810]  Here's Trump arriving. Our system has held up. Yes, our system is standing up against the criminal Trump.
[00:38:24.810 --> 00:38:34.810]  While Biden and his controllers and his idiot son commit incredible crimes in front of us and march the world deeper into World War 3.
[00:38:34.810 --> 00:38:55.810]  Just staggering images. All right, it's going to be an absolute free for all. Any question, any comment, any topic, first time callers, long time callers agree, disagree, have a question. Anything goes as long as you have a clear phone line and you're not cussing.
[00:38:56.810 --> 00:39:18.810]  877-789-2539, 877-789-Alex, 877-789-2539. The phone system is open. And your calls are coming in.
[00:39:18.810 --> 00:39:27.810]  Now, let me go through some more of the news that we'll be delving deeper into throughout the broadcast today.
[00:39:27.810 --> 00:39:38.810]  One week after we broke the news of them planning to bring back the COVID restrictions incrementally, starting with mask and vaccine mandates for all sorts of universities, other institutions.
[00:39:38.810 --> 00:39:47.810]  It is now all officially been announced. Every establishment mouthpiece from The New York Times to ABC to CNN.
[00:39:47.810 --> 00:39:55.810]  Are all reporting that there will be a move to bring back COVID restrictions.
[00:39:55.810 --> 00:40:02.810]  And I really couldn't believe some people doubted me or even let this media came out Friday and made fun of me.
[00:40:02.810 --> 00:40:13.810]  St. Jones is making all this stuff up. When it was directly from whistleblowers and you can even go to the news and see the roll out right then.
[00:40:13.810 --> 00:40:15.810]  So now they've got pretty serious egg on their face.
[00:40:15.810 --> 00:40:21.810]  And I think thanks to listeners and viewers getting that story out, it's still one of the top stories in the world.
[00:40:21.810 --> 00:40:26.810]  Huge mega viral that they may be forced to back off.
[00:40:26.810 --> 00:40:36.810]  I don't know how far they're going to go, but remember, we had to protest and follow lawsuits and demonstrate and judges had to get involved to back them off the last time.
[00:40:36.810 --> 00:40:49.810]  So why don't we just start resisting early now, legally and lawfully and through civil disobedience and get on the offensive to bring Fauci and Gates and Peter Daszak and the whole group to justice.
[00:40:49.810 --> 00:40:56.810]  And there are major criminal investigations going on by states. Criminal investigations have been referred by the Senate.
[00:40:56.810 --> 00:41:03.810]  So we've got a real chance here at stopping this. They're very upset with you.
[00:41:03.810 --> 00:41:10.810]  They're very upset with me because they wanted to incrementally roll this out. Oh, just 14 days to wear the mask to slow the spread.
[00:41:10.810 --> 00:41:15.810]  They're actually saying that on the news. That's a talking point and people aren't buying.
[00:41:16.810 --> 00:41:21.810]  But it'll be very interesting to see how fast they roll this out.
[00:41:21.810 --> 00:41:29.810]  And I need to make contact again with my sources and say, have you heard anything new?
[00:41:29.810 --> 00:41:34.810]  Because they were both told in two different branches of the federal government.
[00:41:34.810 --> 00:41:37.810]  Border Patrol and TSA.
[00:41:37.810 --> 00:41:45.810]  That they were told the policies would be coming out in the next week or so and that they would expect it by the middle of September.
[00:41:45.810 --> 00:41:52.810]  And you notice what comes out on September 15, magically a vaccine that, quote, protects you from the new variant.
[00:41:52.810 --> 00:41:57.810]  They just magically already had ready to the mask. Go back on.
[00:41:57.810 --> 00:42:00.810]  But don't worry. We've got the solution.
[00:42:00.810 --> 00:42:08.810]  And even though less people will take the next round of poison shots, they'll still fool 50 million, 100 million.
[00:42:08.810 --> 00:42:12.810]  I don't know. We'll have to wait and see, unfortunately.
[00:42:12.810 --> 00:42:15.810]  That they can rope into their nets.
[00:42:15.810 --> 00:42:22.810]  So you ask, why would they run the same play again? Well, because they got a long way down the road with it.
[00:42:22.810 --> 00:42:31.810]  So thank God we're not just sitting here reactively, but we're ahead of the curve and got the jump on them.
[00:42:31.810 --> 00:42:38.810]  And you see, when we have media and we have active listeners to spread the word, we can punch through with the truth and really get the enemy off balance.
[00:42:38.810 --> 00:42:43.810]  So we should all strategize the callers as well, if you want to bring it up.
[00:42:43.810 --> 00:42:48.810]  I'm not going to make you talk about what I want to, but how do you think we get ahead of this even more?
[00:42:48.810 --> 00:42:50.810]  What are other issues we can get ahead of?
[00:42:50.810 --> 00:42:54.810]  Well, we've gotten ahead of a lot of it. That's why we're tomorrows news today.
[00:42:54.810 --> 00:42:56.810]  We'll be right back. Stay with us.
[00:42:57.840 --> 00:43:05.240]  I've studied how the globalists, how the mad scientists are controlling us, and they're
[00:43:05.240 --> 00:43:09.920]  doing it by keeping us undernourished. You can eat all the food you want in the world,
[00:43:09.920 --> 00:43:15.400]  but if you don't have the essential vitamins and minerals in an organic, absorbable form,
[00:43:15.400 --> 00:43:19.160]  if you don't have the key elements like iodine, you are literally like someone in
[00:43:19.160 --> 00:43:25.980]  a paddle boat without ores, without paddles. Ladies and gentlemen, we are running a flash
[00:43:25.980 --> 00:43:32.500]  sale, because we're about to sell out of both of these, of X3 and vitamin and fusion in

[00:43:42.580 --> 00:43:47.860]  or never tried vitamin and fusion to take action and try this product because I know
[00:43:47.860 --> 00:43:53.420]  you're going to be blown away by the energy, the stamina, the focus, the libido.

[00:44:57.620 --> 00:45:01.740]  You wanted to plug Rainforce. Do you like Rainforce?
[00:45:01.740 --> 00:45:07.140]  Yeah. So my name is Ken Heckin-Ladley. How do I write all the books that I do? Four
[00:45:07.140 --> 00:45:10.860]  books with Dr. Judy Mikovits, four books with Project Veritas whistleblowers,
[00:45:10.860 --> 00:45:16.260]  and now two books with Alex Jones? That's because I use Brainforce every day.
[00:45:16.300 --> 00:45:21.500]  What I always need is I always need some sort of boost in the morning. And so, you know,
[00:45:21.500 --> 00:45:27.420]  I try to exercise, eat well, take good vitamins. But the one thing that I have really found that
[00:45:27.420 --> 00:45:33.280]  makes a difference is Brainforce. I'll take Brainforce in the morning right before I go to
[00:45:33.280 --> 00:45:37.780]  my computer and I'm good for the next four or five hours writing a whole lot of stuff.
[00:45:37.780 --> 00:45:43.420]  So it really is true that Brainforce is something I use every day and it helps me with my writing.
[00:45:43.420 --> 00:45:46.540]  All right, we love you. We'll be right back. Get your Brainforce Plus,

[00:45:59.420 --> 00:46:03.580]  A lot of listeners have complained in the last two years that our amazing,
[00:46:03.580 --> 00:46:07.520]  high-quality coffee has not been available. And that's because the prices went up too high
[00:46:07.520 --> 00:46:12.220]  for the raw beans and the quality had gone down some. I turned down so many companies
[00:46:12.220 --> 00:46:18.180]  that wanted to work with us. But now we have brought back the coffee and it's even better
[00:46:18.180 --> 00:46:24.460]  from a national supplier that's veteran-owned and veteran-operated. It's powered by the company,

[00:47:21.070 --> 00:47:33.070]  But we can't stand firm without you. And that's why, temporarily, or on this planet, you get all the credit.
[00:47:34.070 --> 00:47:38.070]  Of course, God is the director of our destiny, and we choose it to God.
[00:47:38.070 --> 00:47:41.070]  He's a great arbiter, and all credit goes to God.
[00:47:41.070 --> 00:47:45.070]  But I really mean it to the listeners, the viewers, the crew, everybody.
[00:47:45.070 --> 00:47:50.070]  You're the reason we're here. And I want you to remember that every minute and understand how important you are.
[00:47:50.070 --> 00:47:53.070]  And that's why, when I come and tell you the great victories we're having together,
[00:47:53.070 --> 00:47:56.070]  it's not about bragging, because it's very dangerous to do.
[00:47:56.070 --> 00:48:05.070]  Look at President Trump. Four indictments, 750-something years he faces, going into rigged jurisdictions, rigged juries.
[00:48:05.070 --> 00:48:12.070]  The only place he's got any shot is Miami, because, man, let me tell you, the public is dumbed down now.
[00:48:12.070 --> 00:48:15.070]  There's a lot of awake, smart people, but they're a minority.
[00:48:15.070 --> 00:48:19.070]  But there are just dumbed-down people, and they rig these trials.
[00:48:19.070 --> 00:48:21.070]  They don't let the information in front of people.
[00:48:21.070 --> 00:48:24.070]  They don't let you defend yourself. They let people lie about you.
[00:48:24.070 --> 00:48:34.070]  And then people don't really have that rebel spirit in a lot of places, especially D.C. and places like Atlanta, for whatever reason, or Austin, for that matter.
[00:48:34.070 --> 00:48:46.070]  And it's night and day what jury you'll get in someplace like Montana or Tennessee versus what you'll get in someplace like Austin, Texas, or Atlanta, Georgia.
[00:48:46.070 --> 00:48:50.070]  Because you think of these as formerly more conservative areas. They're not, folks.
[00:48:50.070 --> 00:49:06.070]  Austin indicted Rick Perry, who's not perfect, but not a criminal in my view, when he vetoed a state agency's funding, an anti-corruption watchdog agency that was getting like $50 million a year.
[00:49:06.070 --> 00:49:14.070]  And the exact details, but something like half the money came from the legislature. The other half was given by the counties.
[00:49:14.070 --> 00:49:23.070]  And so he said, if you don't fire the Travis County district attorney, I'm going to veto the money.
[00:49:23.070 --> 00:49:26.070]  Under the law, governors can veto stuff.
[00:49:26.070 --> 00:49:33.070]  And he vetoed it, and they criminally indicted him. It took him three years and $2.5 million to beat it.
[00:49:34.070 --> 00:49:40.070]  You type in Rick Perry talks about his criminal charges and he tells the story.
[00:49:40.070 --> 00:49:51.070]  That's the same Travis County that said I was guilty and told the jury I was guilty and defaulted me and said, you're here to decide how guilty he is.
[00:49:51.070 --> 00:49:55.070]  That's what Trump's facing, but in criminal trials.
[00:49:55.070 --> 00:50:11.070]  And it works, folks. I have sat there myself and watched them bring up to a jury with no evidence that you're a, quote, racist.
[00:50:11.070 --> 00:50:17.070]  And the liberals look at you and shake their heads, and you're going to be civil, you're criminally convicted.
[00:50:18.070 --> 00:50:25.070]  That's why my infrastructure's here. My family's from here since when the town was called Waterloo.
[00:50:25.070 --> 00:50:30.070]  People ask why I live in Austin. I don't take credit for my ancestors.
[00:50:30.070 --> 00:50:42.070]  That's not my deeds that were done, but they wrote the first charter for the rebellion in East Texas at Washington on the Brazos.
[00:50:42.070 --> 00:50:51.070]  They were at the hermitage with President Jackson, who sent them down here to orchestrate it.
[00:50:51.070 --> 00:50:55.070]  And that's on my mom's side of the family. They also raised Colonel Travis's son.
[00:50:55.070 --> 00:51:00.070]  Colonel Travis was killed. His final letter is to my family on my mom's side.
[00:51:00.070 --> 00:51:05.070]  And then on my dad's side, it's similar illustrious stuff.
[00:51:05.070 --> 00:51:12.070]  Also Confederate generals and the whole nine yards. But I don't live off the past glories of my ancestors,
[00:51:12.070 --> 00:51:21.070]  but it is a very saddening thing to be looking in the next few years to having to shut this operation down here
[00:51:21.070 --> 00:51:25.070]  and have a leaner, meaner operation maybe in Georgetown, north of Austin.
[00:51:25.070 --> 00:51:33.070]  It's conservative. Maybe, I mean, I don't know, but I can't live here because the enemy took it.
[00:51:33.070 --> 00:51:38.070]  And it's not running to pull back to different ground in your own state.
[00:51:38.070 --> 00:51:47.070]  But that's why I'm so saddened by the fall of Austin. And it's total election fraud.
[00:51:47.070 --> 00:51:50.070]  I caught them back in the mid 90s. They were newscast about it.
[00:51:50.070 --> 00:51:53.070]  The state board said they're allowed to have fraud. It doesn't matter.
[00:51:53.070 --> 00:51:58.070]  I mean, it's just when Democrats get control, you don't have fair and free elections.
[00:51:58.070 --> 00:52:01.070]  And everybody knows that. And the evidence is overwhelming.
[00:52:01.070 --> 00:52:06.070]  And you have a right to say it. And now they're trying to criminalize investigating them.
[00:52:06.070 --> 00:52:09.070]  What does that tell you? They're going to a one party system.
[00:52:09.070 --> 00:52:14.070]  What did Senator Josh Allee say two weeks ago? I played the clip probably five times.
[00:52:14.070 --> 00:52:21.070]  In fact, chew it up again. Because you've heard me define this as a one party tyranny
[00:52:21.070 --> 00:52:28.070]  that wants the Republican Party to be a broken regional party, that it only allows to operate ceremonially.
[00:52:28.070 --> 00:52:33.070]  And then you'll have a oligarchy or a plutocratic state.
[00:52:33.070 --> 00:52:37.070]  And all those words mean things that run things.
[00:52:37.070 --> 00:52:42.070]  But they're setting up an oligarchy with oligarchs, corporate oligarchs over the world,
[00:52:42.070 --> 00:52:48.070]  with these plutocrats that are in control. And you know what their religion is.
[00:52:48.070 --> 00:52:54.070]  Sexualization of children, pedophilia, just insanity, total surveillance,
[00:52:54.070 --> 00:52:59.070]  nihilistic annihilation of cheap energy and food for the general public.
[00:52:59.070 --> 00:53:06.070]  I mean, the nastiest, cold blooded, just sinister, psychotic demeanor and bearing.
[00:53:06.070 --> 00:53:13.070]  And you see Miami and you think, wow, that's the best shot Trump's got.
[00:53:13.070 --> 00:53:22.070]  And it is. And it's just absolutely disgusting that that's not even a fair shot,
[00:53:22.070 --> 00:53:28.070]  but it's not a completely rigged shot. And you see him knowing the country's in trouble.
[00:53:28.070 --> 00:53:33.070]  Andrew Tate put out a really powerful tweet yesterday. I meant to give it to the crew.
[00:53:33.070 --> 00:53:37.070]  Maybe you guys can scroll in there and find it. You know what?
[00:53:37.070 --> 00:53:41.070]  If you go to Trump.
[00:53:41.070 --> 00:53:48.070]  Coming back to Twitter, and it's the first one under under him right there under his mugshot photo.
[00:53:48.070 --> 00:53:54.070]  And Andrew Tate said, Trump can look at the runway and knows that we're about to run out of runway.
[00:53:54.070 --> 00:54:00.070]  And he knows he has to do what he's got to do. And that's what Trump has said.
[00:54:00.070 --> 00:54:07.070]  Trump has said, I mean, this country is literally being destroyed by people that have sold us out to communist China
[00:54:07.070 --> 00:54:11.070]  and everybody else that are involved in every crime you could ever imagine.
[00:54:11.070 --> 00:54:18.070]  Mass human trafficking of children, pedophilia, devaluation of the dollar.
[00:54:18.070 --> 00:54:24.070]  Look at the cities they run. I mean, once beautiful cities. I mean, New York, amazing city, San Francisco. Amazing.
[00:54:24.070 --> 00:54:32.070]  I love going to New York. I love going to Seattle. I love going to Portland.
[00:54:32.070 --> 00:54:38.070]  I love going to San Francisco. L.A. was pretty fun. And they're scary now, folks.
[00:54:38.070 --> 00:54:44.070]  I mean, real scary. I mean, it's you got to work hard to destroy something like that.
[00:54:44.070 --> 00:54:49.070]  So these are some nasty hombres. We're going to go to break.
[00:54:49.070 --> 00:54:55.070]  Come right back with your calls. But speaking of nasty, the Maui thing is open and shut every level.
[00:54:55.070 --> 00:55:01.070]  They set it up as a tinderbox and then set up the conditions. No water left the power on.
[00:55:01.070 --> 00:55:09.070]  Block headed the people in. That's AP's word. Barricade. And blockade. And then watch them barbecue.
[00:55:10.310 --> 00:55:23.029]  Watch them be incinerated. All right, we're going to go to break here in a couple of minutes.
[00:55:23.029 --> 00:55:29.330]  Let me tell you what else we got here. I got a whole stack on Biden set to announce the
[00:55:29.330 --> 00:55:33.690]  climate emergency. I told you two years ago that would be the next thing they did
[00:55:33.690 --> 00:55:39.170]  after COVID because it was in the WF documents. People said, oh, you're crazy. New York Times
[00:55:39.170 --> 00:55:43.570]  shows is insane. They had articles, oh, crazy people even a month ago are saying there's
[00:55:43.570 --> 00:55:47.650]  a climate emergency coming and he's going to cut the energy off. What do you think he's
[00:55:47.650 --> 00:55:53.730]  been doing with the Keystone pipeline and everything else? So they deny deny deny while they're
[00:55:53.730 --> 00:55:58.130]  rolling it out. And then once it goes full operational, they go, OK, big deal. It's
[00:55:58.130 --> 00:56:03.610]  good. So they're going to shut down more refineries, more oil drilling, more gas drilling,
[00:56:03.610 --> 00:56:09.009]  more pipelines, banned beef and other meat. And 14 said he's just banned it. I'm sure he
[00:56:09.009 --> 00:56:12.890]  banned it. Like, you know, ban your gas stoves and banned gas heaters and banned
[00:56:12.890 --> 00:56:19.029]  gas water heaters and banned gas lawnmowers. I mean, remember just a year ago, he said
[00:56:19.029 --> 00:56:24.009]  he was planning that in policy papers. They went, oh, it's insane. It's not happening.
[00:56:24.009 --> 00:56:29.210]  Now it's a sad course for banning everything. So we've got all that. I mean, look at
[00:56:29.210 --> 00:56:35.250]  the size of that stack. That's that's amazing. We've got the southern border now completely
[00:56:35.250 --> 00:56:40.290]  wide open. Just they've cut everything down and they just wave everybody in. We got video
[00:56:40.290 --> 00:56:49.570]  of that. We've got. Musk vowing to sue Soros over NGOs. We've got school board
[00:56:49.570 --> 00:56:56.570]  fire Satan worshipping non-binary teacher. You got his latest video, Texas board.
[00:56:56.570 --> 00:57:01.890]  As cops force, we remove father reading pornographic book found in school library. That's right.
[00:57:01.890 --> 00:57:06.770]  You as an adult can't show it in public. It's obscene. But your child when they're
[00:57:06.770 --> 00:57:13.170]  nine years old can be given it and taught how to have sex with adults. Yeah. In the
[00:57:13.170 --> 00:57:19.130]  in the book, man pulls down his pants to the little kid. You know, the rest of story
[00:57:19.130 --> 00:57:23.990]  can't show that at a city council or college council or high school council or middle
[00:57:23.990 --> 00:57:30.830]  school council. You can't show that at the anywhere. That's only to be given to children
[00:57:30.830 --> 00:57:34.710]  by the same teachers that tell them how to get in line to have their penises chopped
[00:57:34.710 --> 00:57:42.390]  off. This is our psychotic nutball government. All right, folks, we'll be right back in
[00:57:42.390 --> 00:57:44.590]  full wars dot com. Tomorrow's news today.
[00:57:47.220 --> 00:57:55.200]  I've studied how the globalists, how the mad scientists are controlling us, and they're
[00:57:55.200 --> 00:57:59.859]  doing it by keeping us undernourished. You can eat all the food you want in the world,
[00:57:59.859 --> 00:58:05.339]  but if you don't have the essential vitamins and minerals in an organic, absorbable form,
[00:58:05.339 --> 00:58:09.100]  if you don't have the key elements like iodine, you are literally like someone in
[00:58:09.100 --> 00:58:15.939]  a paddle boat without ores, without paddles. Ladies and gentlemen, we are running a flash

[00:58:51.379 --> 00:58:56.180]  targeting us through the poison shots or the electromagnetic 5G or the GMO crops.
[00:58:56.180 --> 00:59:01.660]  They're hitting us with hundreds of chemicals that the EPA has authorized companies and
[00:59:01.660 --> 00:59:07.779]  industry to use. One of the top pesticides used is Atrazine. The allowable level the
[00:59:07.779 --> 00:59:11.500]  government admits that they allow to be in your water supply is enough to sterilize you
[00:59:11.500 --> 00:59:17.580]  and basically turn your son into a feminized mutant. Look it up. Don't let them do this to

[00:59:49.379 --> 00:59:57.140]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:00:08.580 --> 01:00:23.620]  popular talk show host Nico house makes a really good observation here. I want to play
[01:00:23.620 --> 01:00:28.500]  before we go to your phone calls and that's that you don't have to listen to Alex Jones.
[01:00:28.500 --> 01:00:33.060]  Yeah. I mean, I pay attention. I'm smart. I got some smart guests on, but if you just
[01:00:33.060 --> 01:00:37.700]  look around you, you don't need me to tell you it's an apology report. They want
[01:00:37.700 --> 01:00:40.899]  to ban your gas stoves. They're doing it. You don't need me to tell you they're
[01:00:40.899 --> 01:00:44.540]  shipping illegal aliens in look around you. You don't need me to tell you they're
[01:00:44.540 --> 01:00:50.660]  trying to bring back the COVID crap. Look around you, but the system
[01:00:50.660 --> 01:00:53.979]  ridicules those of us to tell the truth, hoping we just don't want to be
[01:00:53.979 --> 01:00:59.700]  ridiculed. So we'll shut up. No, I'm not shutting up. I'm really blown away
[01:00:59.700 --> 01:01:03.020]  though that the corruption is so insane and the people follow orders so
[01:01:03.020 --> 01:01:10.140]  much that they would do the things they did in Maui. I'm going to cover next hour
[01:01:10.140 --> 01:01:16.100]  after calls and in front of everyone and even mainstream media admits it. And
[01:01:16.100 --> 01:01:20.140]  then there's no talk of arresting in these people. I mean, they just
[01:01:20.140 --> 01:01:24.060]  murdered a bunch of people. It's manslaughter if they're just
[01:01:24.060 --> 01:01:26.620]  negligent, but let me tell you something. It'd be like somebody never
[01:01:26.620 --> 01:01:31.259]  played golf before on a 200 yard drive from the tee, hitting the ball
[01:01:31.259 --> 01:01:35.620]  perfectly into the damn hole, a hole in one. It doesn't happen. This
[01:01:35.620 --> 01:01:43.620]  level of incompetence was perfectly delivered. Perfectly delivered.
[01:01:44.620 --> 01:01:49.620]  Everything was done just right to do this. I mean, just alone having
[01:01:49.620 --> 01:01:53.620]  the police barricade the one road out when the fire is coming from
[01:01:53.620 --> 01:01:58.060]  the other direction and there's no fire in the direction they're
[01:01:58.060 --> 01:02:01.700]  trying to go and the fire is coming up behind them and you sit there
[01:02:01.700 --> 01:02:05.779]  while they die. And then the police drive off and leave them. And some
[01:02:05.779 --> 01:02:09.899]  people escape. The people couldn't get out till the cops. Oh, that's
[01:02:09.899 --> 01:02:16.580]  the other part till the cops finally ran themselves. How do they
[01:02:16.580 --> 01:02:22.100]  sleep at night? How have we produced such trash? Remember I'm doing
[01:02:22.100 --> 01:02:26.620]  the hand sanitizer for 76 minutes and standing around because the chief
[01:02:26.660 --> 01:02:32.660]  of the police in Uvalde, of the school police, just ordered them to.
[01:02:32.660 --> 01:02:36.060]  Pow, pow, people begging for their lives, people in 9-1-1, he's coming
[01:02:36.060 --> 01:02:39.660]  in our room, he's going to kill us, please help us, please, please.
[01:02:39.660 --> 01:02:44.859]  For over an hour and finally a couple feds, not lionizing them,
[01:02:44.859 --> 01:02:48.460]  that's just who did it, federal marshal and some war patrol got
[01:02:48.460 --> 01:02:51.859]  there and ran in and killed the son of a bitch. I mean, it's
[01:02:51.899 --> 01:02:58.500]  just crazy. I know one of the guys that did it. And it's just over
[01:02:58.500 --> 01:03:03.020]  the top, ladies and gentlemen. Absolutely over the top. Here, let's
[01:03:03.020 --> 01:03:05.540]  go to this clip. We'll come back with your phone calls. Here's
[01:03:05.540 --> 01:03:09.460]  Nico House. So Alex Jones came out with a video saying that TSA
[01:03:09.460 --> 01:03:12.419]  whistleblowers contacted him and told him that they will be
[01:03:12.419 --> 01:03:16.899]  bringing back masks and vaccine mandates to airports by October.
[01:03:17.020 --> 01:03:19.779]  No, I know some of you are going to want to say what? That's
[01:03:19.979 --> 01:03:23.220]  Alex Jones. Why are you even reporting this? That man is crazy.
[01:03:23.379 --> 01:03:25.740]  That doesn't even sound reasonable. No mainstream media
[01:03:25.740 --> 01:03:27.899]  reported this. Oh, except for there's a few things you should
[01:03:27.899 --> 01:03:30.700]  consider. Like the fact that TSA and the federal government
[01:03:30.700 --> 01:03:33.620]  never wanted to lift the mask mandates to begin with. They
[01:03:33.620 --> 01:03:37.180]  only did so because the courts forced them to. Or the fact
[01:03:37.339 --> 01:03:40.859]  that businesses and colleges all over the country have started
[01:03:40.859 --> 01:03:45.100]  bringing back both masks and vaccine mandates. Or you can
[01:03:45.100 --> 01:03:48.859]  consider the fact that the news has been inundating us with
[01:03:48.859 --> 01:03:53.140]  COVID after COVID after cases increase after mask mandates
[01:03:53.140 --> 01:03:56.220]  after why we should bring back this after we're preparing a
[01:03:56.220 --> 01:04:01.259]  new booster shot that as if they are preparing us to get
[01:04:01.259 --> 01:04:06.299]  ready for a new set of lockdowns and mandates. You
[01:04:06.299 --> 01:04:08.859]  know what I also find interesting? The fact that all
[01:04:08.859 --> 01:04:13.740]  this COVID-19 fear mongering is arriving right in time for
[01:04:13.740 --> 01:04:17.540]  another election. Fancy that. Not to mention like Jimmy Dore
[01:04:17.540 --> 01:04:21.180]  says here, masking is actually harmful and the science does not
[01:04:21.180 --> 01:04:24.500]  actually support bringing back mask even if COVID-19 were to
[01:04:24.500 --> 01:04:27.299]  have another outbreak. Are you gonna call Alex Jones crazy
[01:04:27.299 --> 01:04:29.339]  again? Or are we just going to look at all the evidence
[01:04:29.339 --> 01:04:31.220]  around us and think for yourselves?
[01:04:47.540 --> 01:05:03.859]  I've studied how the globalist, how the mad scientists are
[01:05:03.859 --> 01:05:07.100]  controlling us. And they're doing it by keeping us
[01:05:07.100 --> 01:05:09.700]  undernourished. You can eat all the food you want in the
[01:05:09.700 --> 01:05:12.819]  world. But if you don't have the essential vitamins and
[01:05:12.819 --> 01:05:15.899]  minerals in an organic, absorbable form, if you don't
[01:05:15.899 --> 01:05:18.939]  have the key elements like iodine, you are literally like
[01:05:18.939 --> 01:05:23.700]  someone in a paddle boat without ores, without panels. Ladies
[01:05:23.700 --> 01:05:27.140]  and gentlemen, we are running a flash sale, because we're
[01:05:27.140 --> 01:05:30.479]  about to sell out of both of these, of X3 and
[01:05:30.479 --> 01:05:34.939]  environmental fusion in the final days of August. This is
[01:05:34.939 --> 01:05:38.299]  a fundraiser. We'll sell out of this. I could sell it at
[01:05:38.299 --> 01:05:40.979]  full price. But I want those of you that have been on the
[01:05:40.979 --> 01:05:44.060]  fence and never tried X3 or never tried environmental
[01:05:44.060 --> 01:05:47.819]  fusion, to take action and try this product because I know
[01:05:47.979 --> 01:05:51.379]  you're going to be blown away by the energy, the stamina, the
[01:05:51.379 --> 01:05:55.939]  focus, the libido. This is so critical. Get your X3
[01:05:55.939 --> 01:05:59.060]  environmental fusion for 40% off right now and
[01:05:59.060 --> 01:06:00.020]  m4store.com.
[01:06:04.100 --> 01:06:07.460]  And now the truth the elite don't want you to hear. It's
[01:06:07.460 --> 01:06:08.339]  Alex Jones.
[01:06:08.339 --> 01:06:15.500]  Now into hour number two, taking your phone calls intersperse
[01:06:15.500 --> 01:06:20.100]  with critical news and information. Here's the
[01:06:20.100 --> 01:06:25.140]  headlines coming up. 14 American cities plan to ban meat
[01:06:25.140 --> 01:06:33.580]  dairy and private vehicles. That's right. Also, hold your
[01:06:33.580 --> 01:06:37.920]  beer Biden regime considering strict new booze guidelines to
[01:06:37.920 --> 01:06:41.479]  pressure Americans to limit alcohol consumption. The UK's
[01:06:41.479 --> 01:06:45.640]  already started it. That's the social credit score to make
[01:06:45.640 --> 01:06:49.359]  you scan a QR code tied to a database to buy tobacco or
[01:06:49.399 --> 01:06:52.680]  alcohol. And then that's really their toll for
[01:06:52.680 --> 01:06:55.720]  everything and Bill Gates is running it with the UN. It's
[01:06:55.720 --> 01:06:59.000]  all confirmed. It's all real. It's all happening. We need to
[01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:04.640]  say absolutely no to all of this. All right. Let's take
[01:07:04.640 --> 01:07:07.879]  your phone calls. Let's talk to folks in Illinois first. Rob,
[01:07:07.879 --> 01:07:08.680]  thanks for calling.
[01:07:10.640 --> 01:07:11.479]  How are you, Alex?
[01:07:12.240 --> 01:07:15.080]  I'm a little uh, my voice is a little stressed. But other
[01:07:15.080 --> 01:07:17.680]  than I'm, you know, watching the world go to hell in a
[01:07:17.680 --> 01:07:20.120]  basket, but at least people are fighting back some. How are
[01:07:20.120 --> 01:07:20.399]  you?
[01:07:21.519 --> 01:07:24.160]  I'm doing all right. All right. So I want to start by
[01:07:24.160 --> 01:07:27.160]  quoting the Declaration of Independence, the second
[01:07:27.160 --> 01:07:33.319]  paragraph. Let me find it real quick. And so here's
[01:07:33.319 --> 01:07:36.200]  what it says, that to secure these rights, governments are
[01:07:36.200 --> 01:07:39.960]  instituted among men, which isn't the case anymore, might I
[01:07:39.960 --> 01:07:42.519]  add, because it's more of an entity that looks over our
[01:07:42.519 --> 01:07:45.120]  head, and I'll get into that in a second, deriving from
[01:07:45.120 --> 01:07:48.640]  their just powers, from the consent of the governed, that
[01:07:48.640 --> 01:07:51.680]  whenever any form of government becomes destructive of these
[01:07:51.680 --> 01:07:54.680]  ends, it is the right of the people to alter or abolish
[01:07:54.680 --> 01:07:57.799]  it, and to institute new government laying its foundation
[01:07:57.799 --> 01:08:02.799]  on. And here's the issue today, Alex, is until we can
[01:08:02.799 --> 01:08:06.560]  do that, and truly replace these evil powers that be, what
[01:08:06.560 --> 01:08:08.960]  we have to do is we need to get through people that are my
[01:08:08.960 --> 01:08:11.879]  age, get through people that this is important, that to be
[01:08:11.879 --> 01:08:15.319]  in a functioning democracy, it is vital that people cast
[01:08:15.359 --> 01:08:18.519]  educated votes and become informed on all of this. But
[01:08:18.519 --> 01:08:21.240]  the issue is, is that most people go through their very
[01:08:21.240 --> 01:08:23.639]  foggy days of distraction, they don't think it's an
[01:08:23.639 --> 01:08:26.639]  important thing. So they're essentially just falling in
[01:08:26.639 --> 01:08:30.519]  line, allowing, they're ignorant to the fact that it
[01:08:30.519 --> 01:08:32.960]  is even a possibility that their rights are being stripped
[01:08:32.960 --> 01:08:36.080]  away. But what I'm saying is we need to get through to the
[01:08:36.080 --> 01:08:39.920]  young generation, the 21 year olds, I'm 21, but I choose
[01:08:39.920 --> 01:08:41.960]  to be informed because I think
[01:08:41.960 --> 01:08:46.320]  that's wonderful. Let me just say something here to you. What
[01:08:46.320 --> 01:08:51.920]  you're getting at is dead on. But let me state something
[01:08:51.920 --> 01:08:54.599]  here. There have been billions and billions of dollars put
[01:08:54.599 --> 01:08:56.880]  into the Heritage Foundation that does a lot of good work
[01:08:57.120 --> 01:09:00.719]  and other libertarian conservative think tanks. But
[01:09:00.719 --> 01:09:04.639]  their main message is leave corporations alone. governments
[01:09:04.639 --> 01:09:07.320]  the problem? Well, corporations together now are
[01:09:07.320 --> 01:09:09.160]  bigger than all the governments and all the
[01:09:09.160 --> 01:09:13.200]  bureaucracies combined. BlackRock is in better
[01:09:13.200 --> 01:09:17.080]  financial shape of the US government. BlackRock has 15
[01:09:17.080 --> 01:09:20.080]  trillion in just liquid cash laying around and
[01:09:20.080 --> 01:09:24.920]  quadrillions in leverage. And they're creating the ESG
[01:09:24.960 --> 01:09:28.680]  global social credit score for corporations that they then
[01:09:28.680 --> 01:09:31.880]  implement and make us follow on record at a Larry Fink's
[01:09:31.880 --> 01:09:35.040]  mouth. So what I need libertarians and people to
[01:09:35.040 --> 01:09:38.280]  understand is the idea I believe libertarian mindset do
[01:09:38.280 --> 01:09:40.280]  no harm, let people live their lives the way they
[01:09:40.280 --> 01:09:43.880]  want to is overall a good thing. But we have to
[01:09:43.880 --> 01:09:48.280]  understand that we need nationalist populism to express
[01:09:48.280 --> 01:09:51.800]  the will of the people. So we have an identity against
[01:09:51.800 --> 01:09:55.320]  this whole globalist leftist rainbow corporate
[01:09:55.880 --> 01:09:58.559]  transhumanist movement that's been developed by the
[01:09:58.559 --> 01:10:01.160]  intelligence agencies and the Carnegie and Rockefeller
[01:10:01.160 --> 01:10:06.320]  endowment at the behest of the big corporations and
[01:10:06.320 --> 01:10:08.760]  private central banks. And then you said something that
[01:10:08.760 --> 01:10:12.639]  was wrong, and I get it. R.L.K. Juniors gets does it.
[01:10:13.160 --> 01:10:16.960]  I understand that in modern parlance, and in modern
[01:10:16.960 --> 01:10:20.240]  nomenclature, it means rule of people, freedom of
[01:10:20.240 --> 01:10:23.360]  people. But we are not a democracy. We are a
[01:10:23.360 --> 01:10:27.440]  constitutional republic that has a limited democracy.
[01:10:27.440 --> 01:10:29.680]  And the reason that's important is our bill of
[01:10:29.680 --> 01:10:31.519]  rights, our Constitution, our Declaration of
[01:10:31.519 --> 01:10:34.800]  Independence doesn't give us rights. It simply points
[01:10:34.800 --> 01:10:37.280]  out rights that we agree we have that are above the
[01:10:37.280 --> 01:10:40.080]  government. And it makes us the sovereign, not King
[01:10:40.080 --> 01:10:44.800]  George, not King Charles, not Barack Obama, not George
[01:10:44.800 --> 01:10:50.160]  Soros. Now, in a pure democracy, if 51 percent
[01:10:50.160 --> 01:10:53.120]  vote to take boys at age five and cut their
[01:10:53.120 --> 01:10:56.240]  penises off because boys are bad, men are bad in
[01:10:56.240 --> 01:11:00.160]  their view, it will happen. If 51 percent say
[01:11:00.160 --> 01:11:02.719]  bring back Aztec sacrifices, it will happen if we
[01:11:02.719 --> 01:11:05.440]  put up with it. In a republic, you don't have the
[01:11:05.440 --> 01:11:08.559]  right to do that. Constitutional republic and the
[01:11:08.559 --> 01:11:11.040]  minority rights are protected as well as the
[01:11:11.040 --> 01:11:14.160]  majority. Now, instead, and I'm at the plate last
[01:11:14.160 --> 01:11:16.719]  week, guys, get me the Vivek Ramanswani clip where
[01:11:16.719 --> 01:11:19.840]  he's outside, talks to a transgender reporter, and
[01:11:19.840 --> 01:11:22.480]  he explains to them, we live in a tyranny of the
[01:11:22.480 --> 01:11:25.440]  minority. But that is what it is. It's the
[01:11:25.440 --> 01:11:29.760]  global elites with their, quote, the way they
[01:11:29.760 --> 01:11:33.440]  checkmate majority rule, it all gets complex, is
[01:11:33.440 --> 01:11:37.280]  a gala dialectic, is they claim they represent
[01:11:37.280 --> 01:11:40.320]  the minorities. So now we have to teach everybody
[01:11:40.320 --> 01:11:43.599]  homosexuality and pedophilia and have no
[01:11:43.599 --> 01:11:45.599]  parental rights because we've got to protect
[01:11:45.599 --> 01:11:49.120]  these children by chopping them up. So it's why
[01:11:49.120 --> 01:11:50.559]  the environmental movement says, oh, we got to
[01:11:50.559 --> 01:11:52.480]  take your rights for the birds and bees and the
[01:11:52.480 --> 01:11:54.800]  puppy dogs. But really, it's about giving the
[01:11:54.800 --> 01:11:56.880]  globalist rights to checkmate and take your
[01:11:56.880 --> 01:12:00.320]  rights away. So it's very complex. It goes into
[01:12:00.320 --> 01:12:03.280]  one party rule, two party rule versus parliamentary
[01:12:03.280 --> 01:12:07.360]  systems. And it takes major research and
[01:12:07.360 --> 01:12:09.840]  understanding to grasp it. But once you grasp
[01:12:09.840 --> 01:12:11.360]  it, there's no going back to we have the best
[01:12:11.360 --> 01:12:13.360]  system in the world. But you're dead on when
[01:12:13.360 --> 01:12:18.080]  you say they have superseded those by bureaucracy
[01:12:18.080 --> 01:12:21.280]  and by the corporate oligarchy that now controls
[01:12:21.280 --> 01:12:23.840]  most of the government officials and are absorbing
[01:12:23.840 --> 01:12:26.719]  the final powers from the government and from
[01:12:26.719 --> 01:12:29.760]  the people to themselves with a technocracy,
[01:12:30.480 --> 01:12:35.680]  social credit score, ESG, social control grid
[01:12:35.680 --> 01:12:38.480]  that is almost in place. And we've got to stop
[01:12:39.040 --> 01:12:41.360]  the central bank digital currency, social credit
[01:12:41.360 --> 01:12:45.599]  score, carbon tax program. Is it because there's
[01:12:45.599 --> 01:12:47.760]  a trade off between the corporations and the
[01:12:47.760 --> 01:12:49.760]  government, where the where the government
[01:12:49.760 --> 01:12:52.320]  essentially, they operate through the morals of
[01:12:52.320 --> 01:12:55.280]  the corporation. And so if the government
[01:12:55.280 --> 01:12:58.000]  essentially doesn't have, like corporations
[01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:00.719]  aren't obliged to work for the best interest
[01:13:00.719 --> 01:13:02.800]  of the people. So what it is, what it is, is
[01:13:02.800 --> 01:13:05.360]  it's a corporate infiltration of local, state,
[01:13:05.360 --> 01:13:07.280]  federal, international government, and then the
[01:13:07.280 --> 01:13:10.800]  evolution and transference of the powers from
[01:13:10.800 --> 01:13:13.599]  the people and their countries and their cultures
[01:13:13.599 --> 01:13:16.400]  to the UN, to the IMF, to the World Bank, to the
[01:13:17.200 --> 01:13:20.160]  Bank of International Settlements. It is a global
[01:13:20.160 --> 01:13:23.120]  corporate coup, global government with the UN
[01:13:23.120 --> 01:13:25.280]  over your health care, but the policies written
[01:13:25.280 --> 01:13:27.440]  by Bill Gates. Thank you so much for the call.
[01:13:27.440 --> 01:13:29.680]  Amazing points. We're going to go out to break
[01:13:29.680 --> 01:13:31.599]  with this Vivek Ramanswamy clip that I meant
[01:13:31.599 --> 01:13:33.840]  to get to that was powerful. Then we'll go
[01:13:33.840 --> 01:13:35.920]  to break and come right back with your phone
[01:13:35.920 --> 01:13:36.880]  calls. Please stay with us.
[01:13:37.840 --> 01:13:39.920]  I was just wondering, what were your opinions
[01:13:39.920 --> 01:13:42.160]  on the LGBT community? Well, I don't think
[01:13:42.160 --> 01:13:44.400]  it's one community. Really? Yeah. I mean,
[01:13:44.400 --> 01:13:46.160]  how could it be? You just mashed together
[01:13:46.160 --> 01:13:48.320]  an alphabet soup. Trans is fundamentally
[01:13:48.320 --> 01:13:50.320]  in tension with gay, if you ask me. But
[01:13:50.320 --> 01:13:53.519]  what's your opinion? I'm personally
[01:13:53.519 --> 01:13:56.719]  a pansexual, so I was just wondering what
[01:13:56.719 --> 01:14:00.639]  your views on same-sex couples were. I don't
[01:14:00.639 --> 01:14:03.280]  have a negative view of same-sex couples,
[01:14:03.280 --> 01:14:05.840]  but I do have a negative view of a tyranny
[01:14:05.840 --> 01:14:08.559]  of the minority. So I think that in the
[01:14:08.559 --> 01:14:10.400]  name of protecting against a tyranny of
[01:14:10.400 --> 01:14:11.680]  the majority, and there are times in
[01:14:11.680 --> 01:14:12.800]  this country's history where we have
[01:14:12.800 --> 01:14:15.519]  had a tyranny of the majority, we have
[01:14:15.519 --> 01:14:16.880]  now, in the name of protecting against
[01:14:16.880 --> 01:14:18.559]  tyranny of the majority, created a new
[01:14:18.559 --> 01:14:20.559]  tyranny of the minority. And I think
[01:14:20.559 --> 01:14:22.000]  that that's wrong. I don't think that
[01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:24.160]  somebody who's religious should be forced
[01:14:24.160 --> 01:14:25.680]  to officiate a wedding that they
[01:14:25.680 --> 01:14:27.599]  disagree with. I don't think somebody
[01:14:28.160 --> 01:14:29.840]  who is a woman who's worked really
[01:14:29.840 --> 01:14:31.200]  hard for her achievements should be
[01:14:31.200 --> 01:14:32.719]  forced to compete against a biological
[01:14:32.719 --> 01:14:35.200]  man in a swim competition. I don't
[01:14:35.200 --> 01:14:37.040]  think that somebody who's a woman that
[01:14:37.040 --> 01:14:40.160]  respects her bodily autonomy and dignity
[01:14:40.160 --> 01:14:41.440]  should be forced to change clothes in
[01:14:41.440 --> 01:14:43.519]  a locker room with a man. That's not
[01:14:43.519 --> 01:14:45.280]  freedom, that's oppression. And so I
[01:14:45.280 --> 01:14:46.480]  believe that we live in a country
[01:14:46.480 --> 01:14:48.639]  where free adults should be free to
[01:14:49.360 --> 01:14:50.639]  dress how they want, behave how they
[01:14:50.639 --> 01:14:52.960]  want, and that's fine. But you don't
[01:14:52.960 --> 01:14:54.480]  oppress, you don't become oppressive by
[01:14:54.480 --> 01:14:56.080]  foisting that on others, and that
[01:14:56.080 --> 01:14:57.440]  especially includes kids, because kids
[01:14:57.440 --> 01:14:59.200]  aren't the same as adults. And so I
[01:14:59.200 --> 01:15:00.559]  think adults are free to make whatever
[01:15:00.559 --> 01:15:02.880]  choices they want, but do not voice
[01:15:02.880 --> 01:15:05.360]  that ideology onto children before
[01:15:05.360 --> 01:15:07.840]  children are in a position as adults to
[01:15:07.840 --> 01:15:10.320]  make decisions for themselves. And so I
[01:15:10.320 --> 01:15:11.680]  think a lot of the frustration in the
[01:15:11.680 --> 01:15:12.719]  country, and if I'm being really
[01:15:12.719 --> 01:15:15.600]  honest that I also share, comes from
[01:15:15.600 --> 01:15:18.320]  that new culture of oppression where
[01:15:18.320 --> 01:15:20.320]  saying those things can actually get
[01:15:20.320 --> 01:15:23.760]  somebody punished. And in my case, it's
[01:15:23.760 --> 01:15:25.280]  part of why it's my responsibility to
[01:15:25.280 --> 01:15:26.960]  say them. And I respect that you may
[01:15:26.960 --> 01:15:28.559]  have a different opinion, and that's
[01:15:28.559 --> 01:15:30.000]  okay. Part of what makes our country
[01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:32.240]  great is that you and I can be civil
[01:15:32.320 --> 01:15:34.559]  and have this conversation, and that we
[01:15:34.559 --> 01:15:36.480]  live in a country that still gives us,
[01:15:36.480 --> 01:15:39.440]  each of us, the right to speak to a
[01:15:39.440 --> 01:15:40.799]  presidential candidate and back, and
[01:15:41.680 --> 01:15:43.040]  still say that we pledge allegiance
[01:15:43.040 --> 01:15:45.040]  to the same nation. So I think that's
[01:15:45.040 --> 01:15:46.559]  the beauty of our country, and that's
[01:15:46.559 --> 01:15:47.600]  my honest opinion.
[01:15:47.600 --> 01:15:48.880]  Awesome, well thank you very much,
[01:15:48.880 --> 01:15:49.519]  I appreciate it.
[01:15:49.519 --> 01:15:50.960]  Thank you for your civility as well,
[01:15:50.960 --> 01:15:51.519]  I appreciate it.
[01:15:58.400 --> 01:16:01.040]  I've studied how the globalists, how
[01:16:01.040 --> 01:16:02.799]  the mad scientists are controlling us,
[01:16:03.440 --> 01:16:05.440]  and they're doing it by keeping us
[01:16:05.440 --> 01:16:07.360]  undernourished. You can eat all the
[01:16:07.360 --> 01:16:08.480]  food you want in the world, but if
[01:16:08.480 --> 01:16:11.040]  you don't have the essential vitamins
[01:16:11.040 --> 01:16:13.120]  and minerals in an organic, absorbable
[01:16:13.120 --> 01:16:14.559]  form, if you don't have the key
[01:16:14.559 --> 01:16:16.559]  elements like iodine, you are
[01:16:16.559 --> 01:16:18.719]  literally like someone in a paddleboat
[01:16:18.719 --> 01:16:20.960]  without ores, without paddles.
[01:16:21.680 --> 01:16:23.600]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are running
[01:16:23.600 --> 01:16:25.600]  a flash sale, because we're about
[01:16:25.600 --> 01:16:27.360]  to sell out of both of these, of
[01:16:27.360 --> 01:16:31.040]  X3 environmental fusion in the
[01:16:31.040 --> 01:16:33.280]  final days of August. This is a
[01:16:33.280 --> 01:16:35.920]  fundraiser, we'll sell out of this,
[01:16:35.920 --> 01:16:37.600]  I can sell it at full price, but
[01:16:37.600 --> 01:16:38.880]  I want those of you that have
[01:16:38.880 --> 01:16:40.559]  been on the fence and never tried
[01:16:40.559 --> 01:16:42.320]  X3, or never tried environmental
[01:16:42.320 --> 01:16:44.639]  fusion, to take action and try
[01:16:44.639 --> 01:16:46.480]  this product, because I know you're
[01:16:46.480 --> 01:16:48.080]  going to be blown away by the
[01:16:48.080 --> 01:16:50.000]  energy, the stamina, the focus,
[01:16:50.559 --> 01:16:53.040]  the libido. This is so critical.
[01:16:53.040 --> 01:16:55.440]  Get your X3 environmental fusion
[01:16:55.440 --> 01:16:56.880]  for 40% off right now.
[01:16:58.480 --> 01:16:59.840]  The wicked plot against the
[01:16:59.840 --> 01:17:01.840]  righteous, and gnash their teeth
[01:17:01.840 --> 01:17:03.920]  at them, but the Lord laughs at
[01:17:03.920 --> 01:17:05.280]  the wicked, for he knows their
[01:17:05.280 --> 01:17:07.920]  day is coming. The wicked draw the
[01:17:07.920 --> 01:17:09.840]  sword and bend the bow, to bring
[01:17:09.840 --> 01:17:11.760]  down the poor and needy, to slay
[01:17:11.760 --> 01:17:14.160]  those whose ways are upright, but
[01:17:14.160 --> 01:17:15.760]  their swords will pierce their own
[01:17:15.760 --> 01:17:17.440]  hearts, and their bows will be
[01:17:17.440 --> 01:17:19.440]  broken. Better the little that
[01:17:19.440 --> 01:17:20.960]  have righteousness, than the
[01:17:20.960 --> 01:17:22.880]  wealth of many wicked, for the
[01:17:22.880 --> 01:17:24.000]  power of the wicked will be
[01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:25.920]  broken, but the Lord upholds the
[01:17:25.920 --> 01:17:28.639]  righteous. The blameless spend
[01:17:28.639 --> 01:17:30.559]  their days under the Lord's care,
[01:17:30.559 --> 01:17:32.080]  and their inheritance will endure
[01:17:32.080 --> 01:17:34.480]  forever. In times of disaster,
[01:17:34.480 --> 01:17:36.799]  they will not wither. In days of
[01:17:36.799 --> 01:17:38.240]  famine, they will have plenty,
[01:17:39.120 --> 01:17:40.400]  but the wicked will perish.
[01:17:41.360 --> 01:17:42.559]  Though the Lord's enemies are
[01:17:42.559 --> 01:17:43.840]  like the flowers in the field,
[01:17:44.400 --> 01:17:46.240]  they will be consumed, and they
[01:17:46.240 --> 01:17:58.480]  will grow up in smoke.
[01:17:58.480 --> 01:18:00.639]  I beg you to think about how
[01:18:00.639 --> 01:18:03.680]  important your word of mouth is,
[01:18:03.680 --> 01:18:05.760]  and you sharing the articles, and

[01:19:58.040 --> 01:20:07.040]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:20:08.520 --> 01:20:38.520]  And now, the man who won't be silenced. Welcome to the Alex Jones show. Look, we're in a lot of trouble. If you've studied history, you'll see periods of time where hundreds of years go by and there's a nice kingdom and a nice leadership and there's prosperity.
[01:20:38.520 --> 01:21:08.520]  And the government's fair and stays small. And then, they get a crazy leader. And they just start doing horrible things. And pretty soon, they're just murdering and slaughtering innocent people everywhere. And then, over time, a few more generations, that country, that empire will collapse. Because there are a lot of really crazy, evil people out there.
[01:21:08.520 --> 01:21:38.520]  But there's even more people that will follow orders as long as they believe it's the establishment.
[01:21:38.520 --> 01:21:47.520]  I see the footage all the time of some crazy woman shooting people in the street for no reason and the cop perfectly hits her with a car, right in the leg, just to knock it out of her hand.
[01:21:47.520 --> 01:22:02.520]  I mean, most of the police charge in, but when they have bad leadership and they're told to stand down, you get what just happened in Maui.
[01:22:03.520 --> 01:22:15.520]  And you don't need evil cops on the bottom for evil to run things if the cops follow orders. So America's not about following illegal, unlawful orders.
[01:22:15.520 --> 01:22:25.520]  Now, the crew found the footage. This woman's running around shooting a gun at people. Boom. Hits her perfectly just in the leg, does a killer, and they get the firearm away.
[01:22:25.520 --> 01:22:32.520]  Imagine having that job. That was out in Los Angeles. I mean, it's happening every few minutes, this type of just lunatic behavior.
[01:22:32.520 --> 01:22:41.520]  And I'm sorry, some woman's walking around black, white, I don't care who you are. I guess that's why I'm not a cop. You're shooting guns, people in the public, I'm going to shoot you.
[01:22:41.520 --> 01:22:50.520]  But see, they're politically correct there. Oh, they shoot a black woman, you know, they're bad. I don't care what color she is. She's running around randomly shooting at cars driving by.
[01:22:50.520 --> 01:22:59.520]  I'm not going to risk my life to drive into her leg with a cruiser, I'd shoot her. But I guess I'd get charged by Soros DA and spend 20 years in prison.
[01:22:59.520 --> 01:23:09.520]  But I'm digressing and I want to go to your calls. What I'm getting at here is, it's not just the police that shouldn't follow unlawful orders. It's all of us.
[01:23:09.520 --> 01:23:18.520]  The Germans were very moral, hardworking, per capita, the smartest people in the world, historians said at the time, before World War II.
[01:23:18.520 --> 01:23:28.520]  The most inventions, the hardest working, but Germans are known for one thing, aren't they? Following orders, following rules.
[01:23:28.520 --> 01:23:47.520]  But if there's not a rule, then the Germans will do whatever they want. But what happens when you have bad rulers over you, and now you'll do whatever the Fuhrer says?
[01:23:48.520 --> 01:23:57.520]  This government is completely overrun, total corruption everywhere. We have cancer. And I know I've said this, I'm going to go back to your calls.
[01:23:57.520 --> 01:24:03.520]  I said I take a lot of calls. I just spent eight minutes at the last caller. So I'm going to give each caller about two minutes. I want to hear from you all.
[01:24:03.520 --> 01:24:07.520]  And we'll skip the next network break coming up, not this one, but the next one, so we get more time here.
[01:24:07.520 --> 01:24:14.520]  Because I really got to do a deep dive on Maui. I probably should have just covered Maui up front because I'm so upset by this.
[01:24:14.520 --> 01:24:22.520]  I mean, folks, this is so open and shut and so evil that they thought they wouldn't get in trouble for this.
[01:24:22.520 --> 01:24:35.520]  Just the barricading people on the one road out when there's no fire there and the fire's rushing towards them and the police finally flee as they watch the cars and the families they kept from getting out die.
[01:24:35.520 --> 01:24:46.520]  Burn up. I mean, I've spent a lot of time researching this, folks. And even the Associated Press says exactly what I say. This has me shook up.
[01:24:46.520 --> 01:24:54.520]  I mean, I'm really shook up right now because we know people get killed all the time. Governments do bad things.
[01:24:54.520 --> 01:25:02.520]  But America, Hawaii, the police follow orders. And that's just one thing they did.
[01:25:03.520 --> 01:25:11.520]  I said, I know your calls. I just. You know, I said I'd go to Hawaii.
[01:25:11.520 --> 01:25:18.520]  But maybe we should just have reporters covered from there because I think I'd get I'd probably get arrested.
[01:25:18.520 --> 01:25:25.520]  Because, man, some cop walks over to me in the middle of that area while they're covering up what they did and starts telling me not to film.
[01:25:25.520 --> 01:25:31.520]  I mean. I can just tell you at a fundamental level, this is a real line of the sand for me.
[01:25:31.520 --> 01:25:39.520]  And I take it very personal what they did. It's not like they were the branch Davidians that shot back at the ATF and they were innocent and deserve to die.
[01:25:39.520 --> 01:25:47.520]  But at least there was some reason the feds murdered them. Some excuses. People didn't do anything except powerful people wanted their land.
[01:25:47.520 --> 01:25:54.520]  And then the cops and the bureaucracy sat there. And I mean, I'm not going to blame the people of Maui, but this is what I meant to say.
[01:25:54.520 --> 01:26:00.520]  And I'm going to say it now. And then I promise I'll go to your calls.
[01:26:00.520 --> 01:26:06.520]  But I do blame to a certain extent. And I don't say this to be holier than thou.
[01:26:06.520 --> 01:26:10.520]  And I don't say this to criticize. I'm saying.
[01:26:10.520 --> 01:26:19.520]  If I lived in a town like that and I saw the last five years after Black Rock bought the power company and they still get all the tax money and everything,
[01:26:19.520 --> 01:26:25.520]  them cut any research of arcing that was being they have sensors that report massive arcing all the time.
[01:26:25.520 --> 01:26:31.520]  Fires getting caught all the time. They wouldn't repair them. They wouldn't update them. They wouldn't put rubber containers on them.
[01:26:31.520 --> 01:26:35.520]  They wouldn't put up shielding. They just kept all the money and didn't fix the infrastructure.
[01:26:35.520 --> 01:26:41.520]  Just like Enron did for a decade in California. Remember that?
[01:26:41.520 --> 01:26:47.520]  And then they cut the water off and wouldn't let them have it. And then they left the electricity on and then they didn't put on the alarms.
[01:26:47.520 --> 01:26:53.520]  And then they blocked the people inside to die when there's an open road and no fire completely right there.
[01:26:53.520 --> 01:26:58.520]  You can see the video next hour and all the eyewitnesses.
[01:26:58.520 --> 01:27:05.520]  That that did that broke the blockade. And then you finally see the police when the fire is right there.
[01:27:05.520 --> 01:27:12.520]  They cut and leave. You're a cop watching fire 60, 70 yards away.
[01:27:12.520 --> 01:27:19.520]  You're looking at a safe way on fire and you're 60 yards away with backed up traffic blocking the only road out.
[01:27:19.520 --> 01:27:25.520]  You work there. You live there. You know, it's the only main street out and you sit there and follow the orders.
[01:27:25.520 --> 01:27:31.520]  What is wrong with you? You're the problem.
[01:27:31.520 --> 01:27:38.520]  People like that. But I don't just blame the police for following orders.
[01:27:38.520 --> 01:27:45.520]  In California is the only other state I know of doing this where they won't cut the brush in areas they decide around the power lines.
[01:27:45.520 --> 01:27:50.520]  They call it rewilding. Notice it's in the poor areas where the rich people are moving.
[01:27:50.520 --> 01:27:57.520]  So as soon as a rich neighborhood gets up close to you or a development they want or a golf course, what happens?
[01:27:58.380 --> 01:28:04.020]  They don't trim the trees in your area and you burn down.
[01:28:04.020 --> 01:28:06.420]  That's how California operates.
[01:28:06.420 --> 01:28:08.420]  That's because it's the same scum.
[01:28:08.420 --> 01:28:16.460]  All right, I said I'd, I'm gonna stop now, go back in three minutes, bam, bam, bam, every
[01:28:16.460 --> 01:28:17.460]  single one of you.
[01:28:17.460 --> 01:28:20.700]  Then I'll go some of the next hour with calls and take me 45 minutes to get to all
[01:28:20.700 --> 01:28:21.700]  the Maui news.
[01:28:21.700 --> 01:28:26.900]  So I'll go to 20 after with your calls next hour that gives us close to an hour
[01:28:26.900 --> 01:28:30.660]  and then I'll cover the Maui news and so much more.
[01:28:30.660 --> 01:28:36.020]  But man, again, the fact that they did it in front of everybody and they think we're so
[01:28:36.020 --> 01:28:38.100]  stupid they can't see what we did.
[01:28:38.100 --> 01:28:42.420]  So I'm gonna say this about the folks in La Hana or anywhere else, use La Hana as
[01:28:42.420 --> 01:28:43.420]  an example.
[01:28:43.420 --> 01:28:47.580]  You can't count on the government to do things like trim trees around power lines and that's
[01:28:47.580 --> 01:28:51.660]  a weapon in your backyard when high winds and it's dry.
[01:28:51.660 --> 01:28:54.180]  So everybody out there better take this as an example.
[01:28:54.180 --> 01:28:58.460]  Are they not cutting the power lines around you?
[01:28:58.460 --> 01:29:04.060]  I've studied how the globalist, how the mad scientist are controlling us and they're doing
[01:29:04.060 --> 01:29:05.900]  it by keeping us undernourished.
[01:29:05.900 --> 01:29:10.540]  You can eat all the food you want in the world, but if you don't have the essential
[01:29:10.540 --> 01:29:14.820]  vitamins and minerals in an organic, absorbable form, if you don't have the key elements
[01:29:14.820 --> 01:29:20.700]  like iodine, you are literally like someone in a paddle boat without ores, without
[01:29:20.700 --> 01:29:21.700]  paddles.

[01:30:03.700 --> 01:30:06.700]  doing it by keeping us undernourished.

[01:30:58.780 --> 01:31:00.620]  The globalists are only humans.
[01:31:00.620 --> 01:31:04.220]  Yeah, they have control of the central banks, they have a lot of power, but they can be
[01:31:04.220 --> 01:31:08.700]  defeated, but some of their operations are going to take decades to stop, but one thing
[01:31:08.700 --> 01:31:13.220]  you can do right now is take control of your body and your family's body by purifying the
[01:31:13.220 --> 01:31:17.940]  water that you drink and that you cook with, and you do it with the highest quality
[01:31:17.940 --> 01:31:20.020]  gravity fed filter out there.

[01:31:24.860 --> 01:31:28.900]  It purifies very quickly and it cuts out thousands of chemicals to non-detectable
[01:31:28.900 --> 01:31:29.900]  levels.
[01:31:29.900 --> 01:31:31.500]  This is what I use, which my family uses.

[01:31:48.340 --> 01:31:52.020]  This is one of the main areas we can take control of our lives and stop the globalists
[01:31:52.020 --> 01:31:54.780]  from hitting us with poison that they allow in the water supply.
[01:31:54.780 --> 01:31:58.660]  In some cases, they add the water supply like fluoride.
[01:31:58.660 --> 01:32:03.040]  You're going to want to pay attention to what I'm about to say in the next 60 seconds.
[01:32:03.040 --> 01:32:08.280]  Two new incredible products are now available exclusively at m4store.com.
[01:32:08.280 --> 01:32:13.040]  They are both clones of national best selling products from a major pharmaceutical
[01:32:13.040 --> 01:32:17.120]  slash supplement maker that are listeners of Patriots that are allowing us to private
[01:32:17.120 --> 01:32:20.640]  label it at a lower price you'll find in stores.
[01:32:20.640 --> 01:32:24.760]  It's Joint Relief Max and Nerve Renew.
[01:32:24.760 --> 01:32:30.880]  Both of these have known documented natural compounds to lower pain and to also make your
[01:32:30.880 --> 01:32:36.640]  nerves healthier which is one of the major reasons nerves get irritated and are more inductive
[01:32:36.640 --> 01:32:37.640]  to pain.
[01:32:37.640 --> 01:32:39.960]  There's major research behind this all.
[01:32:39.960 --> 01:32:47.100]  You need to get Joint Relief Max from Infowars MD and Nerve Renew from Infowars MD exclusively
[01:32:47.100 --> 01:32:50.200]  at m4store.com right now.

[01:32:55.400 --> 01:32:56.200]  fund our operation.
[01:32:57.600 --> 01:33:04.600]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:27.600 --> 01:33:31.600]  All right, thanks for calling in. I really want to hear from you.
[01:33:31.600 --> 01:33:36.600]  We're supposed to get upset about this stuff. If we don't, we're going to get completely enslaved.
[01:33:36.600 --> 01:33:42.600]  Let's go to Connecticut. Let's talk to George. Let's talk about going after BlackRock and the corporate criminals
[01:33:42.600 --> 01:33:45.600]  who are not updating infrastructure anywhere for the average people, folks,
[01:33:45.600 --> 01:33:48.600]  selectively knowing damn well what they're doing,
[01:33:48.600 --> 01:33:55.600]  but to make sure somebody went in and hacked the power lines with hatchets so they'd fall over.
[01:33:55.600 --> 01:34:04.600]  Oh yeah, it's bad. We're going to show you the footage of the people that did bucket and did drive around the police and survived.
[01:34:04.600 --> 01:34:09.600]  The footage coming out is devastating. Let's go to George in Connecticut. George, go ahead.
[01:34:09.600 --> 01:34:15.600]  Alex, you're in my prayers. I wanted to make, I have a couple of main points on BlackRock,
[01:34:15.600 --> 01:34:19.600]  but before I wanted to go into that, I wanted to make some points on something you said.
[01:34:19.600 --> 01:34:24.600]  I think we should realize that the corporate system is basically like a Gordon E. Knott.
[01:34:24.600 --> 01:34:28.600]  We are the Alexanders that's got to take that sword out and slice it to pieces.
[01:34:28.600 --> 01:34:34.600]  And how we do that is that the corporate system was based on, from the very ancient beginning,
[01:34:34.600 --> 01:34:42.600]  they had to be a benefit to the crown and the people. This was in the whole principles.
[01:34:42.600 --> 01:34:47.600]  If we take that into consideration and we find, go back to those laws,
[01:34:47.600 --> 01:34:51.600]  I think we can cut the Gordon E. Knott by saying, look, you've broken the contract,
[01:34:51.600 --> 01:34:57.600]  you lose your licenses, you lose your patents, you lose your copyrights,
[01:34:57.600 --> 01:35:02.600]  and to the bureaucracy that's also part of this network now,
[01:35:02.600 --> 01:35:08.600]  we say if you don't adhere to your constitutional oath,
[01:35:08.600 --> 01:35:13.600]  then you lose your pensions and you lose your protection.
[01:35:13.600 --> 01:35:14.600]  And by the way, George, you just nailed it.
[01:35:14.600 --> 01:35:18.600]  Going back to the black nobility in Italy when it was city-states,
[01:35:18.600 --> 01:35:21.600]  they had the first, the Chinese had them too, modern contracts.
[01:35:21.600 --> 01:35:25.600]  And to get them stamped, you had to have the local nobility
[01:35:25.600 --> 01:35:29.600]  and usually a council of people stamp it.
[01:35:29.600 --> 01:35:32.600]  Ancient Greece had this in some of its city-states as well.
[01:35:32.600 --> 01:35:38.600]  Then, as you know, in France and then in England with the British East India Company,
[01:35:38.600 --> 01:35:40.600]  then you had letters of marque.
[01:35:40.600 --> 01:35:41.600]  You're absolutely right.
[01:35:41.600 --> 01:35:44.600]  When these corporations or governments become destructive of the people,
[01:35:44.600 --> 01:35:46.600]  Declaration of Independence, they're known void.
[01:35:46.600 --> 01:35:52.600]  They busted up in the 90s Microsoft for doing one one-millionth what Gates has done now.
[01:35:52.600 --> 01:35:56.600]  He just went and bought off the regulators and moved into medicine to run our lives.
[01:35:56.600 --> 01:35:58.600]  You're absolutely right.
[01:35:58.600 --> 01:36:01.600]  But for people who don't know the story of the Gordian knot,
[01:36:01.600 --> 01:36:05.600]  and I just vaguely remember it, tell us that story.
[01:36:05.600 --> 01:36:11.600]  The story is basically there was a legend, or it was that all Asia knew,
[01:36:11.600 --> 01:36:15.600]  that if you came to, I forgot the name of the exact town,
[01:36:15.600 --> 01:36:17.600]  but maybe it was Gordio or something like that,
[01:36:17.600 --> 01:36:22.600]  and they had a holy temple there with a huge knot that was so intricate,
[01:36:22.600 --> 01:36:24.600]  nobody could untangle it.
[01:36:24.600 --> 01:36:29.600]  The legend was that the first person that could untangle this knot,
[01:36:29.600 --> 01:36:33.600]  they would conquer Asia and the whole world.
[01:36:33.600 --> 01:36:35.600]  And that's what Alexander came to.
[01:36:35.600 --> 01:36:37.600]  He looked at the Gordian knot.
[01:36:37.600 --> 01:36:42.600]  He pulled out his sword and sliced it to pieces and took it apart.
[01:36:43.600 --> 01:36:45.600]  That's right. And that's what we have to do.
[01:36:45.600 --> 01:36:48.600]  We have to abolish the FBI.
[01:36:48.600 --> 01:36:52.600]  We have to abolish the EPA and FDA and create new agencies.
[01:36:52.600 --> 01:36:57.600]  We have to abolish the corporate credit rating of BlackRock,
[01:36:57.600 --> 01:37:01.600]  who's maneuvering the U.S. to lose our ratings.
[01:37:01.600 --> 01:37:06.600]  We're being maneuvered into destruction while they consolidate power and invest in China.
[01:37:06.600 --> 01:37:07.600]  It's us or them.
[01:37:07.600 --> 01:37:11.600]  They're literally on television saying, we're going to run your life.
[01:37:11.600 --> 01:37:13.600]  No, you're not.
[01:37:13.600 --> 01:37:18.600]  Okay, on BlackRock, the issues that they actually called in on originally,
[01:37:18.600 --> 01:37:27.600]  we should use this great, arrogant thing that they did and bring left to right together.
[01:37:27.600 --> 01:37:31.600]  Remember, we had Occupy Wall Street was the leftist thing.
[01:37:31.600 --> 01:37:33.600]  Well, here we are.
[01:37:33.600 --> 01:37:39.600]  BlackRock is the biggest, the baddest thing that both left and right could come together for.
[01:37:39.600 --> 01:37:48.600]  Antitrust, they should be forced to be under antitrust, broken up into a million, billion pieces.
[01:37:48.600 --> 01:37:53.600]  Then RICO should be hit on them for all their illegal activities
[01:37:53.600 --> 01:37:56.600]  because they're not just with Lahaina.
[01:37:56.600 --> 01:37:59.600]  They're also with all the medical-
[01:37:59.600 --> 01:38:00.600]  Well, let's expand on that.
[01:38:00.600 --> 01:38:04.600]  If you watch the movie about the Deepwater Horizon that's off the court transcripts
[01:38:04.600 --> 01:38:07.600]  with Mark Wahlberg and Kurt Russell, it's incredibly accurate.
[01:38:07.600 --> 01:38:11.600]  Because I remember following the trial at the time, having guessed on about it, like Greg Palast,
[01:38:11.600 --> 01:38:14.600]  they literally go to their engineers and they say,
[01:38:14.600 --> 01:38:18.600]  we're spending 30 million a day drilling these deepest wells ever.
[01:38:18.600 --> 01:38:24.600]  We've just decided we're not going to dump concrete into the hole anymore
[01:38:24.600 --> 01:38:26.600]  in these 30,000-foot deep wells.
[01:38:26.600 --> 01:38:30.600]  And they said, sir, it will blow up in the transcripts
[01:38:30.600 --> 01:38:32.600]  because they made transcripts of these.
[01:38:32.600 --> 01:38:34.600]  If you do that, it will blow up.
[01:38:34.600 --> 01:38:38.600]  And they said, well, we're a $43 billion company today.
[01:38:38.600 --> 01:38:40.600]  By not doing this, we'll be 48 billion by next week.
[01:38:40.600 --> 01:38:42.600]  So the orders came from London.
[01:38:42.600 --> 01:38:45.600]  You will not dump concrete on top of it.
[01:38:45.600 --> 01:38:50.600]  And they follow the orders and it blew up two days later.
[01:38:50.600 --> 01:38:52.600]  So it's the same thing.
[01:38:52.600 --> 01:38:56.600]  BlackRock is not trimming the trees anywhere they own the damn power lines
[01:38:56.600 --> 01:38:58.600]  so they get record profits.
[01:38:58.600 --> 01:39:00.600]  I mean, these people are crazy.
[01:39:00.600 --> 01:39:04.600]  Okay. And since they own the pharmaceuticals too,
[01:39:04.600 --> 01:39:07.600]  I think that is premeditated, showing premeditated murder
[01:39:07.600 --> 01:39:14.600]  as well as premeditated things for exterminating the populace
[01:39:14.600 --> 01:39:15.600]  they're supposed to be representing.
[01:39:15.600 --> 01:39:18.600]  They should also be brought under Nuremberg as well.
[01:39:18.600 --> 01:39:22.600]  So RICO, Antitrust, and Nuremberg, they should be done.
[01:39:22.600 --> 01:39:25.600]  And we should start a chant that basically says
[01:39:25.600 --> 01:39:33.600]  that they are not, when we think about Trump,
[01:39:33.600 --> 01:39:37.600]  we should always yell to these stupid, mindless people,
[01:39:37.600 --> 01:39:39.600]  it isn't about Trump.
[01:39:39.600 --> 01:39:43.600]  It's about coming through Trump after us, all of us,
[01:39:43.600 --> 01:39:46.600]  left and right, middle, whatever.
[01:39:46.600 --> 01:39:50.600]  If we don't help Trump, they're coming for us next.
[01:39:50.460 --> 01:39:58.940]  I totally agree. And instead, these arrogant people are barreling straight ahead, saying,
[01:39:58.940 --> 01:40:05.860]  oh, we'll just declare our opposition terrorist and start a civil war. It's a bunch of billionaires
[01:40:05.860 --> 01:40:10.100]  disconnected from reality, thinking no matter how bad the crisis gets, they can just manage
[01:40:10.100 --> 01:40:17.720]  it again. And that is not the case. We're oil spilling world history. And BP ordered
[01:40:17.720 --> 01:40:26.120]  them to do mathematically what they knew would explode. And they followed the orders again.
[01:40:26.120 --> 01:40:33.460]  And what do you think? Yeah, go ahead. Go ahead. Go ahead. No, it's just it's crazy.
[01:40:33.460 --> 01:40:37.640]  I just wanted to lastly say, what do you think if we could get some of the constitutional
[01:40:37.640 --> 01:40:43.880]  lawyers you've had on and others in a group to basically go after them for their antitrust,
[01:40:43.880 --> 01:40:49.540]  the RICO and Nuremberg, as well as their corporate breaking? Oh, listen, listen, there's no silver
[01:40:49.540 --> 01:40:54.480]  bullet, but beating the drum of their criminals, criminal referrals on Fauci. Nobody knew
[01:40:54.480 --> 01:41:00.000]  what Black Rock was 20 years ago. Now most people know. So absolutely. God bless you.
[01:41:00.000 --> 01:41:06.320]  Thanks for the call. Great call. Let's go ahead and take another call. Let's talk
[01:41:06.320 --> 01:41:15.800]  to Kathy in Arizona. Kathy, go ahead. Alex. Yes, Kathy. Good afternoon. God bless you
[01:41:15.800 --> 01:41:23.840]  and everyone out there. And to the Hawaiian Islands, Maui, God bless you. God is very
[01:41:23.840 --> 01:41:30.760]  angry. I am very angry. I think this is day 17. I'm still shaking, grieving for all
[01:41:30.760 --> 01:41:36.840]  your souls. Where are the bodies that can't even have a decent burial? People
[01:41:36.840 --> 01:41:43.080]  should be outraged sharing these stories all over the world. God is
[01:41:43.080 --> 01:41:47.440]  not going to let these bastards get away with this. And you're going to get
[01:41:47.440 --> 01:41:53.600]  trillions to rebuild your island. Well, I mean, look, here's the deal. I care
[01:41:53.600 --> 01:41:57.600]  about Lahaina and all the dead children. It's terrible. But it's the globalists
[01:41:57.600 --> 01:42:01.520]  that ran this operation as some type of test. And now they blocked it off, and
[01:42:01.520 --> 01:42:04.200]  they're trying to cover it up. And because they control the Justice
[01:42:04.200 --> 01:42:07.920]  Department and FEMA, they're getting away with it right now. So all I'm
[01:42:07.920 --> 01:42:12.240]  saying is they're covering up a crime scene. They're caught red handed. It's
[01:42:12.240 --> 01:42:15.960]  insane. And what do we do about it? We're going to have a special
[01:42:15.960 --> 01:42:23.200]  honor. I wanted to get to two other points, if I may. I want to address
[01:42:23.200 --> 01:42:28.880]  PTSD, if people are suffering. I'm actually, I think I'm going through it
[01:42:28.880 --> 01:42:32.960]  right now, thinking of the masks coming back and stuff. I can't take it.
[01:42:32.960 --> 01:42:37.480]  When I go out in public, my neighborhoods, they're walking their
[01:42:37.480 --> 01:42:40.960]  dogs with masks on. I just can't take it again. I don't know what I'm going to
[01:42:40.960 --> 01:42:47.400]  do. I wish I could go to an island right now. Drive around, bullhorn
[01:42:47.400 --> 01:42:50.800]  them, exactly. Just don't let them shut you down.
[01:42:50.920 --> 01:42:55.360]  Resist. Don't let it overwhelm you. Resist it. Spread the word. I'd like to
[01:42:55.360 --> 01:42:58.720]  know how many other people are going through this. This is part of the
[01:42:58.720 --> 01:43:02.840]  PSYOP, I'm sure. But the second question is, if there's some smart
[01:43:03.400 --> 01:43:08.040]  genius out there, including yourself, why in the hell have we let these
[01:43:08.040 --> 01:43:12.480]  monsters run this country down in the world for two and a half years?
[01:43:12.480 --> 01:43:17.960]  Why can't we not shut down the DC, the dirty rats? We got to
[01:43:18.000 --> 01:43:21.760]  recognize the DCs run by BlackRock. Thank you for the call. All right,
[01:43:21.760 --> 01:43:24.600]  we're gonna move quick now. Al Tiller in Virginia, you're on the air.
[01:43:26.600 --> 01:43:31.080]  Hey, first off, Alex, I just want to say that your nitric boost and
[01:43:31.080 --> 01:43:36.040]  that new goodnight sleep formula, that's like the old knockout used to
[01:43:36.040 --> 01:43:39.560]  be, but without the sludgy buildup. That was the only issue I used to
[01:43:39.560 --> 01:43:44.200]  have with knockout. That formula is phenomenal. You may have to dose it
[01:43:44.200 --> 01:43:49.000]  in half so you can take two if you want to full dose. But I just want
[01:43:49.000 --> 01:43:52.720]  to hit on real quick with the Tucker interview with Trump.
[01:43:52.840 --> 01:43:53.560]  It was incredible.
[01:43:53.680 --> 01:43:57.240]  Look, yeah, it was incredible. But there were a couple of train
[01:43:57.240 --> 01:44:00.100]  wreck moments where he was talking about the CIA and how we
[01:44:00.100 --> 01:44:03.800]  did so many wonderful things. And he gets pressed on it. And he
[01:44:03.800 --> 01:44:08.840]  says, oh, we took out Soleimani and Al Baghdadi, but it wasn't the
[01:44:08.840 --> 01:44:13.280]  CIA that coordinated it. So he needs to get with, I think he needs
[01:44:13.280 --> 01:44:17.800]  to get on the Vivek train where these agencies got to go.
[01:44:17.800 --> 01:44:21.600]  Vivek's definitely more informed than Trump. And Trump also said,
[01:44:21.600 --> 01:44:24.400]  oh, I think Epstein probably killed himself. But then went, but
[01:44:24.400 --> 01:44:27.080]  actually they turned the cameras off and covered the whole thing
[01:44:27.080 --> 01:44:30.120]  up. So maybe they killed him. Yeah, that was that was weak.
[01:44:30.400 --> 01:44:32.880]  But I mean, overall, it was pretty strong.
[01:44:34.440 --> 01:44:37.280]  Again, and I want to support the guy and I'm going to vote for
[01:44:37.280 --> 01:44:41.760]  him. But if you don't know it, like we're six years into him
[01:44:41.760 --> 01:44:45.840]  now. And look, Trump, you need your you need the team around
[01:44:45.840 --> 01:44:48.840]  you. You need Bannon back. He should be given interviews with
[01:44:48.840 --> 01:44:52.160]  you. He needs Roger. He needs General Flynn. He needs the
[01:44:52.160 --> 01:44:55.520]  people that know how to dismantle this thing. Because we
[01:44:55.520 --> 01:44:59.480]  can't run into another four years of heat. You know, why
[01:44:59.480 --> 01:45:02.200]  doesn't Trump bring up black black rock because he thinks he
[01:45:02.200 --> 01:45:05.880]  can if because he knows he's a good guy. He thinks he can
[01:45:06.520 --> 01:45:10.400]  maneuver these these entities to do what he wants. But all
[01:45:10.400 --> 01:45:13.000]  they'll do without weight is is wait him out.
[01:45:13.400 --> 01:45:15.880]  They'll play area and I appreciate your call. Look how
[01:45:15.880 --> 01:45:19.040]  upset the Atlantic is that's owned by Steve Jobs widow, one
[01:45:19.040 --> 01:45:22.040]  of the most frequent visitors Epstein Island. The mugshot is
[01:45:22.040 --> 01:45:25.200]  a warning. Donald Trump's booking photo was supposed to be
[01:45:25.200 --> 01:45:28.840]  an exercise in humility. He turned it into a threat.
[01:45:31.480 --> 01:45:34.000]  Look, we can worry about what Trump's gonna do when he
[01:45:34.000 --> 01:45:37.080]  gets reelected. He said in the Tucker Carlson interview that
[01:45:37.080 --> 01:45:39.320]  I meant to play that clip. Guys, see, we can find it.
[01:45:39.320 --> 01:45:42.280]  It's an hour long, where he says look, I was ignorant
[01:45:42.280 --> 01:45:45.760]  before. I didn't know how DC work. Now I know it's all run
[01:45:45.760 --> 01:45:48.840]  by multinational intelligence agencies. We're gonna dismantle
[01:45:48.840 --> 01:45:51.480]  them when I get there. That is a declaration of war against
[01:45:51.480 --> 01:45:53.880]  them. That was a hardcore statement. But Al killer. I do
[01:45:53.880 --> 01:45:57.640]  hear your points. All right, let's talk to a caller in
[01:45:57.640 --> 01:46:01.560]  Denver, Colorado. Let's talk Tyler. Globalism hitting the
[01:46:01.560 --> 01:46:02.840]  local level. Go ahead.
[01:46:04.400 --> 01:46:06.640]  Alex, how's it going? It's Tyler. Welcome.
[01:46:06.640 --> 01:46:11.560]  So yeah, there's like a recent story out of Denver that I think
[01:46:11.560 --> 01:46:16.320]  the newly elected governor said he's gonna stop breaking down
[01:46:16.320 --> 01:46:19.240]  these homeless camps. And I've been seeing it like firsthand,
[01:46:19.240 --> 01:46:22.440]  like, right down the road from my house, just constant
[01:46:22.440 --> 01:46:25.960]  buildup. And it's, it's a damn shame. And the welfare
[01:46:25.960 --> 01:46:27.920]  pays for it all. They let the drug dealers give them the
[01:46:27.920 --> 01:46:31.720]  drugs. It's a formula that they have these leftist NGOs
[01:46:31.720 --> 01:46:35.120]  that then milk part of the welfare, they get up to 100
[01:46:35.160 --> 01:46:38.480]  grand a year per person, particularly disabled, sometimes
[01:46:38.480 --> 01:46:41.360]  even more in California up to 200 grand a year. And then the
[01:46:41.360 --> 01:46:44.280]  leftist groups, like they control illegal aliens and milk
[01:46:44.280 --> 01:46:47.560]  them, they then milk the homeless. So the problem gets
[01:46:47.560 --> 01:46:51.080]  worse as the left runs it. These are milking farms for
[01:46:51.080 --> 01:46:51.680]  welfare.
[01:46:52.800 --> 01:46:55.800]  Yeah, exactly. It's all a plan. Like that's actually I'm
[01:46:55.800 --> 01:46:58.800]  glad you pointed out that program you said in California,
[01:46:58.800 --> 01:47:02.240]  because they actually started a program here in Denver, I think
[01:47:02.240 --> 01:47:06.280]  was six months ago giving like homeless people up to like
[01:47:06.800 --> 01:47:10.600]  50,000, I think, up to like 100,000. And it's just insane,
[01:47:10.600 --> 01:47:13.560]  you know, like, but like you said, this is all a globalist
[01:47:13.560 --> 01:47:16.560]  plan to, you know, deteriorate the city. I just want to thank
[01:47:16.560 --> 01:47:19.760]  you for your service, you know, for all these years of waking
[01:47:19.760 --> 01:47:21.880]  people up. And I just, you know, want to reiterate the
[01:47:21.880 --> 01:47:25.960]  points. We got to hold the line, you know, we're, this
[01:47:25.960 --> 01:47:29.960]  is a God plan. God's on our side. And, you know, you're
[01:47:29.960 --> 01:47:32.200]  direct line to that, you know, you're on that, right?
[01:47:32.200 --> 01:47:34.320]  Well, we're all connected to God one way or another, but I'm
[01:47:34.320 --> 01:47:37.520]  trying to be connected to God. I just know that everything
[01:47:37.520 --> 01:47:40.240]  they do is designed to destroy society. I mean, they
[01:47:40.240 --> 01:47:42.760]  want to sterilize our children, they're doing it. So
[01:47:42.760 --> 01:47:46.080]  great point, sir. Thank you so much for the call. Kim in
[01:47:46.080 --> 01:47:47.800]  Wisconsin, you're on the air. Go ahead, Kim.
[01:47:49.520 --> 01:47:53.720]  I've had six major head injuries, so I'm going to read
[01:47:53.720 --> 01:47:57.480]  what I'd like to say. First, I apologize to Alex for saying
[01:47:58.000 --> 01:48:02.160]  califragilistice was from Chitty Chitty Bang Bang with
[01:48:02.200 --> 01:48:06.120]  Peter Peter. I was wrong and I'm sorry. Second, the
[01:48:06.120 --> 01:48:11.360]  important part with Hawaii and the bio weapon jab. I say
[01:48:11.400 --> 01:48:15.920]  no more, no more math, no more shots and people, pets or
[01:48:15.920 --> 01:48:19.800]  livestock, food businesses and power plants need to be
[01:48:19.800 --> 01:48:24.000]  protected with cameras and guns. All towns need to band
[01:48:24.000 --> 01:48:27.200]  together and act like the Amish and rebuild the food
[01:48:27.200 --> 01:48:31.360]  processing, buildings, homes as it is up to us. We the
[01:48:31.360 --> 01:48:35.800]  people, towns need to make sure your trees and shrubs are
[01:48:35.800 --> 01:48:39.480]  cut back to a safe distance from power lines. My town
[01:48:39.480 --> 01:48:42.360]  fails on that. This must be done for the murdered
[01:48:42.360 --> 01:48:46.280]  children, or they will murder them all. Semper Fi and I
[01:48:46.280 --> 01:48:46.680]  love you.
[01:48:47.240 --> 01:48:49.880]  Thank you so much. Appreciate the call. Icarus in
[01:48:49.880 --> 01:48:51.080]  Wisconsin. Welcome.
[01:48:51.680 --> 01:48:57.920]  Hey, Mr. Jones. You're always over the horizon with your
[01:48:57.920 --> 01:49:00.280]  predictions and what you talk about in your show and kind of
[01:49:00.280 --> 01:49:03.040]  slipped through the news this week about how you talk
[01:49:03.040 --> 01:49:05.960]  about India landing on the south pole of the moon.
[01:49:06.880 --> 01:49:10.080]  They're just cruising their rover this morning and they
[01:49:10.080 --> 01:49:18.160]  landed on the 23rd at 833am Eastern Time. Their lander is
[01:49:18.240 --> 01:49:22.040]  called Valor or Vikram in their language and the rover is
[01:49:22.040 --> 01:49:25.200]  called Wisdom. And I remember you talking about that and
[01:49:25.200 --> 01:49:27.720]  other moon stuff. And at the same time-
[01:49:27.720 --> 01:49:30.640]  Yeah, I know. I said 15 years ago, the Indians are
[01:49:30.640 --> 01:49:32.400]  going to be given the moon mission, told where the
[01:49:32.400 --> 01:49:35.120]  water is at, so they will discover the water. They
[01:49:35.120 --> 01:49:38.400]  would crash a probe 10 years ago on the moon, find
[01:49:38.400 --> 01:49:40.840]  the water, and they would land right where the water
[01:49:40.840 --> 01:49:43.960]  was found by secret NASA missions, according to Buzz
[01:49:43.960 --> 01:49:46.320]  Aldrin. And I'm on record saying that because I
[01:49:46.640 --> 01:49:47.480]  talked to Buzz Aldrin.
[01:49:48.320 --> 01:49:50.600]  Yeah, and guess what they're looking for? They're openly
[01:49:50.600 --> 01:49:53.440]  looking for water and it's like a checkerboard lander.
[01:49:53.600 --> 01:49:54.840]  There's pictures of it.
[01:49:55.080 --> 01:49:57.400]  Yeah, and they already know right where it is. And
[01:49:57.400 --> 01:49:58.880]  that's why everybody says we didn't go to the moon.
[01:49:59.680 --> 01:50:02.240]  No, ladies and gentlemen, they gave you fake photos
[01:50:02.240 --> 01:50:04.840]  and some images. They need to show you the real stuff
[01:50:04.840 --> 01:50:07.840]  when the moon is on. They have more advanced
[01:50:07.840 --> 01:50:11.360]  spacecraft, larger spacecraft, but the landers themselves
[01:50:11.360 --> 01:50:14.360]  and things are real. Notice the Indian lander is
[01:50:14.360 --> 01:50:17.200]  basically a copy of our landers. So things are way
[01:50:17.200 --> 01:50:19.280]  more advanced than people are being told. I knew
[01:50:19.280 --> 01:50:22.080]  people like Raymond Teague that was a mission
[01:50:22.080 --> 01:50:25.080]  director of communications on three of the Apollo
[01:50:25.080 --> 01:50:28.520]  programs. And I knew him well, good friend of mine
[01:50:28.680 --> 01:50:31.240]  even worked here for a while. That guy was 100%
[01:50:31.240 --> 01:50:34.040]  real Air Force Intelligence Vietnam. And he said
[01:50:34.040 --> 01:50:37.200]  100% it was all going on. But there was a whole
[01:50:37.200 --> 01:50:39.640]  other backup mission and other stuff from the
[01:50:39.640 --> 01:50:42.280]  military that they weren't supposed to know about.
[01:50:42.280 --> 01:50:44.320]  But they would pick up some of the
[01:50:44.320 --> 01:50:47.160]  communications sometime of what was going on. And
[01:50:47.160 --> 01:50:51.480]  the real truth is, it wasn't Buzz Aldrin and Neil
[01:50:51.480 --> 01:50:53.360]  Armstrong that were first to go there. They had a
[01:50:53.360 --> 01:50:55.360]  lot of volunteers and a bunch of people died
[01:50:55.360 --> 01:50:57.360]  just like the Russians had a bunch of missions
[01:50:57.360 --> 01:50:59.680]  that they admitted dead on the moon. There's
[01:50:59.680 --> 01:51:01.840]  crash craft with dead Russians, dead Chinese, you
[01:51:01.840 --> 01:51:04.200]  name it. So it's so embarrassing they don't put
[01:51:04.200 --> 01:51:06.880]  it out there. The United States threw hundreds of
[01:51:06.880 --> 01:51:08.920]  missions at the moon before they got five or
[01:51:08.920 --> 01:51:11.360]  six in a row successful and were willing to put
[01:51:11.360 --> 01:51:14.440]  that on television. But then they dolled up
[01:51:14.440 --> 01:51:17.800]  photos and stuff. Because you can't bring film
[01:51:17.800 --> 01:51:19.680]  footage back through the Van Allen radiation
[01:51:19.680 --> 01:51:22.800]  belt and fries it. Now they can because it's held
[01:51:22.800 --> 01:51:26.520]  on digital chips. But before they couldn't. So
[01:51:26.520 --> 01:51:30.520]  they created all that for a PR operation.
[01:51:30.520 --> 01:51:32.680]  But there's definitely a giant space program.
[01:51:32.680 --> 01:51:34.080]  It's way bigger than the public knows.
[01:51:35.000 --> 01:51:36.920]  Yeah, they've spent, you know, 10s and 10s of
[01:51:36.920 --> 01:51:39.520]  trillions of dollars just in the US. Like, I
[01:51:39.520 --> 01:51:41.280]  wonder what they've all put up there. And of
[01:51:41.280 --> 01:51:43.240]  course, I think, you know, they put weaponry
[01:51:43.240 --> 01:51:45.600]  up there, even though we don't think we know I
[01:51:45.600 --> 01:51:47.200]  knew the head of the Star Wars program under Bob
[01:51:47.200 --> 01:51:50.880]  Bowman, who, a big tough guy Air Force
[01:51:50.880 --> 01:51:53.360]  Colonel, he's on record running it was a secret
[01:51:53.360 --> 01:51:56.360]  program right into Reagan. And he came here, he
[01:51:56.360 --> 01:51:58.440]  said, Yeah, I'm dying of leukemia. I'll probably
[01:51:58.440 --> 01:52:00.160]  be dead in a week or two. But I'm gonna go
[01:52:00.160 --> 01:52:01.480]  ahead and give you the secrets on air because
[01:52:01.480 --> 01:52:03.360]  they actually leaked some of them. And he said,
[01:52:03.360 --> 01:52:05.760]  Yeah, by 1979, we had a bunch of platforms
[01:52:05.760 --> 01:52:09.600]  with Shabo DU meteor guns and, you know, at
[01:52:09.600 --> 01:52:15.280]  least 50 robot controlled decapitation weapons
[01:52:15.280 --> 01:52:16.480]  that could kill all the world leaders in an
[01:52:16.480 --> 01:52:18.400]  hour. And he said, All right, I'll see you
[01:52:18.400 --> 01:52:21.200]  later. Got in his RV, drove off and died two
[01:52:21.200 --> 01:52:23.640]  weeks later, like he said he was tough, man,
[01:52:24.000 --> 01:52:26.880]  tough guy. And yeah, he was a real head of the
[01:52:26.880 --> 01:52:28.880]  program. So yeah, we actually know what was
[01:52:28.880 --> 01:52:29.560]  really going on.
[01:52:31.080 --> 01:52:33.440]  And you know, how we have in space, the space
[01:52:33.440 --> 01:52:35.080]  treaty with Russia and China, you know,
[01:52:35.080 --> 01:52:38.280]  adversary countries, you mentioned Maui, and kind
[01:52:38.280 --> 01:52:40.200]  of linking it up there, I think we should have a
[01:52:40.200 --> 01:52:42.400]  similar effort for natural disasters and
[01:52:42.400 --> 01:52:45.800]  wildfires, where like how Chile calls Russia's
[01:52:46.040 --> 01:52:50.280]  IL 73. Super water bombers to come put out
[01:52:50.280 --> 01:52:53.680]  their wildfires. There's no reason why those IL
[01:52:53.680 --> 01:52:58.080]  73 water bombers just sit in the hangar as
[01:52:58.080 --> 01:53:00.760]  Hawaiians are barbecued. And however the fire
[01:53:00.760 --> 01:53:03.760]  started, if it was no, but that's all part of
[01:53:03.760 --> 01:53:07.280]  it. Exactly. Turn off the water. Don't cut the
[01:53:07.280 --> 01:53:09.600]  trees. Don't cut the power. Don't put on the
[01:53:09.600 --> 01:53:11.600]  emergency sirens. And then the coup de grace
[01:53:11.640 --> 01:53:14.720]  had the police on the main one road out
[01:53:14.720 --> 01:53:17.200]  that's totally fire free blockade them in to
[01:53:17.200 --> 01:53:21.040]  die. I mean, that's all confirmed now. And
[01:53:21.040 --> 01:53:24.080]  then they're blocking an investigation of the
[01:53:24.080 --> 01:53:27.760]  people they murdered. We need to know who gave
[01:53:27.760 --> 01:53:29.000]  the orders. Thanks for the call.
[01:53:29.000 --> 01:53:41.400]  Alright, Dave, and Trace, and Titus, and Kevin
[01:53:41.400 --> 01:53:44.000]  and Tammy and Tony and Joe, we're gonna get to
[01:53:44.000 --> 01:53:45.800]  Ollie when we come back. That'll be it for
[01:53:45.800 --> 01:53:48.280]  calls though, these eight or nine calls that are
[01:53:48.280 --> 01:53:49.880]  there, because I got to spend the time on
[01:53:49.880 --> 01:53:51.880]  Maui and do it right. Get it on record what
[01:53:51.880 --> 01:53:54.000]  happened because it's one thing to have me tell
[01:53:54.000 --> 01:53:57.240]  you about it. It's a whole nother ball of wax
[01:53:58.080 --> 01:54:00.840]  to actually be looking at what they did in the
[01:54:00.840 --> 01:54:02.680]  actual footage people that got out because I
[01:54:02.680 --> 01:54:03.960]  mean, they're backed up the cops will let
[01:54:03.960 --> 01:54:06.000]  them through this fire all around the cars.
[01:54:06.120 --> 01:54:07.640]  And then finally the cops leave and they get
[01:54:07.640 --> 01:54:11.360]  out because they're up the front. The cops
[01:54:11.360 --> 01:54:13.000]  finally went, well, I guess I'm not going to
[01:54:13.000 --> 01:54:16.440]  follow orders to sit here and die. Once again,
[01:54:16.440 --> 01:54:17.920]  the cops weren't in on it, folks, they're
[01:54:17.920 --> 01:54:22.480]  told to go do this. Man, I tell you, it's the
[01:54:22.480 --> 01:54:24.720]  most disgusting thing I've ever seen. Because
[01:54:24.760 --> 01:54:28.520]  following orders in the face of death, when you
[01:54:28.520 --> 01:54:30.760]  know, it's the fires behind the people, the
[01:54:30.760 --> 01:54:32.680]  buildings are burning, you look and the roads
[01:54:32.680 --> 01:54:34.840]  are totally open to the highway, and you don't
[01:54:34.840 --> 01:54:38.880]  let people go through what? So what if you
[01:54:38.880 --> 01:54:41.120]  get fired later, but you're not gonna get
[01:54:41.120 --> 01:54:44.680]  fired, your boss is gonna go to prison. And
[01:54:44.680 --> 01:54:45.960]  I'll tell you, the cops that kept those
[01:54:45.960 --> 01:54:50.120]  people there, manslaughter, they should all
[01:54:50.120 --> 01:54:52.040]  spend 10 years in prison. But whoever
[01:54:52.040 --> 01:54:55.640]  premeditatedly ordered that needs to get hung.
[01:54:55.680 --> 01:55:01.000]  And that's not a vindictive thing, they murdered all those children and people.
[01:55:01.000 --> 01:55:05.360]  I want an investigation, I want indictments, and I want death penalty.
[01:55:05.360 --> 01:55:10.880]  I want those people to be executed, just like they executed those women and children.
[01:55:10.880 --> 01:55:13.980]  How much of this are we going to take, people?
[01:55:13.980 --> 01:55:16.360]  This footage coming up will make you vomit.
[01:55:16.360 --> 01:55:19.360]  I haven't even shown it yet, I don't even want to look at it again.
[01:55:19.360 --> 01:55:24.080]  I got like six, seven videos of the fires around the cars and the cops are stopping
[01:55:24.080 --> 01:55:25.080]  people.
[01:55:25.080 --> 01:55:34.160]  I, while the emergency managers were on another island together at a hotel, yeah, pretty obvious
[01:55:34.160 --> 01:55:35.160]  folks.
[01:55:35.160 --> 01:55:36.160]  Disgusting.
[01:55:36.160 --> 01:55:41.720]  Alright, we're going to go to break, I need financing to fight the globalists, plus we've
[01:55:41.720 --> 01:55:46.400]  got great products you need, these are historic, they're one of a kind, we sold out of Alex
[01:55:46.400 --> 01:55:51.000]  Jones for President shirt, told you these are all limited editions now, and we have
[01:55:51.000 --> 01:55:58.600]  a few of the political prisoner original mugshot, which is not the real mugshot, that
[01:55:58.600 --> 01:56:02.480]  you can get at info.store.com for $70.76, but what we do have being printed right
[01:56:02.480 --> 01:56:09.020]  now is the real Trump mugshot, never surrender t-shirt, and on the front there's a yellow
[01:56:09.020 --> 01:56:13.480]  one, a gold one, and then there's a white one, a black and white one, says Trump 2024,
[01:56:13.480 --> 01:56:20.200]  on the back it says never surrender, that's what he said yesterday, infowars.com.
[01:56:20.200 --> 01:56:27.760]  So Trump 2024, in black and white, and in gold, would never surrender on the back, and
[01:56:27.760 --> 01:56:32.860]  that's a designer shirt, ladies and gentlemen, high quality fabric, high quality printing,
[01:56:32.860 --> 01:56:39.440]  so when we're selling these for $17.76, we paid like $15 for these, so we're just
[01:56:39.440 --> 01:56:42.240]  selling that one almost at cost, it's almost gone.
[01:56:42.240 --> 01:56:48.360]  So the original, limited edition political prisoner shirt, that is not the accurate mugshot, something
[01:56:48.360 --> 01:56:52.880]  we came up with when they were originally going to do it and didn't, then we now have
[01:56:52.880 --> 01:56:57.200]  the real mugshot, and if you want those, they're being printed right now, anybody
[01:56:57.200 --> 01:57:00.840]  tells you you've got the shirt, and it isn't a two week wait, it is full of it,
[01:57:00.840 --> 01:57:05.240]  we put the order in this morning, they'll be done in about a week and a half, they're
[01:57:05.240 --> 01:57:08.800]  making them right here in Texas, and they'll be shipping out, so get your orders
[01:57:08.800 --> 01:57:15.040]  in now, and get a piece of history, Trump 2024 in black and white, the real mugshot,
[01:57:15.040 --> 01:57:19.760]  Never Surrender on the back, Infowars.com, and we have the gold one as well, I think
[01:57:19.760 --> 01:57:25.000]  the gold will be the most popular, but we will see, all three shirts now available,
[01:57:25.000 --> 01:57:29.120]  the original ready to ship, limited edition, about to sell out, and we also have a flash
[01:57:29.120 --> 01:57:34.700]  sale of X3, limited supply came in, environmental fusion, both are selling out very very quickly,
[01:57:34.700 --> 01:57:38.880]  but despite that, they're 40% off, that's what finances operation, want to thank
[01:57:38.880 --> 01:57:43.180]  you all for your support, we'll be back with more calls in hour number 3, and a deep
[01:57:43.180 --> 01:57:44.940]  deep dive on Malley, stay with us.
[01:57:46.440 --> 01:57:53.719]  I've studied how the globalists, how the mad scientists are controlling us, and they're
[01:57:53.719 --> 01:57:56.719]  doing it by keeping us undernourished.
[01:57:56.719 --> 01:58:00.599]  You can eat all the food you want in the world, but if you don't have the essential
[01:58:00.599 --> 01:58:04.879]  vitamins and minerals in an organic, absorbable form, if you don't have the key elements
[01:58:04.879 --> 01:58:11.799]  like iodine, you are literally like someone in a paddle boat without ores, without paddles.
[01:58:11.799 --> 01:58:16.480]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are running a flash sale, as we're about to sell out of both of
[01:58:16.480 --> 01:58:22.480]  these, of X3 and vitaminal fusion in the final days of August.
[01:58:22.480 --> 01:58:28.320]  This is a fundraiser, we'll sell out of this, I can sell it at full price, but I want those
[01:58:28.320 --> 01:58:33.320]  of you that have been on the fence and never tried X3 or never tried vitaminal fusion
[01:58:33.320 --> 01:58:37.960]  to take action and try this product because I know you're going to be blown away by the
[01:58:37.960 --> 01:58:43.320]  energy, the stamina, the focus, the libido, this is so critical.
[01:58:43.320 --> 01:58:49.360]  Get your X3 and vitaminal fusion for 40% off right now at Infowarsstore.com.
[01:58:49.360 --> 01:58:53.599]  Coffee has not been available at Infowarsstore.com for two years because the price went up
[01:58:53.599 --> 01:58:55.839]  too high and the quality was starting to go down.
[01:58:55.839 --> 01:59:00.480]  I turned out so many other producers that wanted to partner with us, but when the
[01:59:00.480 --> 01:59:03.480]  folks at Minuteman came to me a year ago and I began to try their coffees, I was
[01:59:03.480 --> 01:59:08.200]  blown away, we finally have three great coffees that are the best they have to offer
[01:59:08.200 --> 01:59:09.960]  available to you right now.
[01:59:09.960 --> 01:59:14.540]  This is the best coffee I've ever tasted, it smells amazing and it's some of the strongest
[01:59:14.540 --> 01:59:15.960]  coffee I've ever drank.
[01:59:15.960 --> 01:59:20.879]  Ladies and gentlemen, these three single source Colombian coffees are now available
[01:59:20.879 --> 01:59:23.440]  at Infowarsstore.com exclusively.
[01:59:23.440 --> 01:59:28.599]  Escape the prison planet light roast, tastes great, it's the strong one, really strong,
[01:59:28.599 --> 01:59:33.559]  but these are all close second and thirds, medium roast, wake of America, whoo, that's
[01:59:33.559 --> 01:59:34.559]  what my go-to.
[01:59:34.559 --> 01:59:39.040]  Dark roast, tip of the spear, tastes the best and is amazing and is still very, very
[01:59:39.040 --> 01:59:40.519]  strong, gives you that pep.
[01:59:40.519 --> 01:59:45.400]  They're all three available at Infowarsstore.com and they fund our operation and each order
[01:59:45.400 --> 01:59:50.599]  gets a pocket constitution citizen rule book.
[01:59:50.599 --> 01:59:56.639]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:59:58.599 --> 02:00:06.919]  All right, I meant to open the broadcast up with the point that our next caller is
[02:00:06.919 --> 02:00:11.960]  about to make, but I see it on the board, Dave in St. Louis says, combat vet on warfare
[02:00:11.960 --> 02:00:13.879]  against America.
[02:00:13.879 --> 02:00:19.480]  And when you really boil this down, this is asymmetrical 21st century, bureaucratic
[02:00:19.480 --> 02:00:22.759]  culture war to demoralize and break down the country.
[02:00:22.759 --> 02:00:26.400]  And I mean, that's it, and you could admit you're under attack and it's sideways to
[02:00:26.400 --> 02:00:29.679]  mitigate it and help others mitigate it or you can roll over and die.
[02:00:29.679 --> 02:00:34.000]  So I'm glad you called in on that same point to remind me, Dave, I guess our minds
[02:00:34.000 --> 02:00:35.000]  think alike.
[02:00:35.000 --> 02:00:37.000]  Go ahead from St. Louis.
[02:00:37.000 --> 02:00:38.000]  You there, AJ?
[02:00:38.000 --> 02:00:39.000]  Yes, sir.
[02:00:39.000 --> 02:00:40.519]  God bless you and your family.
[02:00:40.519 --> 02:00:41.519]  I'm a combat vet.
[02:00:41.519 --> 02:00:46.559]  It sounds like I don't have that long, so if you let me get through a couple of points,
[02:00:46.559 --> 02:00:51.599]  what I'd like to say is I'm not hearing a lot of how or what people can do.
[02:00:51.599 --> 02:00:53.879]  People need to get local, get to their sheriffs.
[02:00:53.879 --> 02:00:59.839]  They need to keep eyes out on things, any new people out, suspicious people.
[02:00:59.839 --> 02:01:02.839]  What we're focusing on, like in Maui and these places, are battles.
[02:01:02.839 --> 02:01:08.000]  But if you take the thousand foot view, you'll see that there's a lot of battles.
[02:01:08.000 --> 02:01:09.000]  This is the war.
[02:01:09.000 --> 02:01:13.440]  It's about a calling depopulation and they have to use various ways.
[02:01:13.440 --> 02:01:16.000]  These guys can only make phone calls and push buttons.
[02:01:16.000 --> 02:01:19.160]  They literally, some of them can't even tie their own damn shoes.
[02:01:19.160 --> 02:01:23.280]  So that being said, we are actually doing this to ourselves.
[02:01:23.280 --> 02:01:25.360]  So the kingdom is within.
[02:01:25.360 --> 02:01:29.799]  You have to get to the mind and then you have to get to your own people and it is
[02:01:29.799 --> 02:01:31.519]  a mindset.
[02:01:31.519 --> 02:01:34.960]  What has happened is they have played the long game and they've got to the key people
[02:01:34.960 --> 02:01:39.320]  and they use manifestation of telling us this or that or whatever's going to happen
[02:01:39.320 --> 02:01:40.440]  and they have to.
[02:01:40.440 --> 02:01:42.320]  That's because they have to use it.
[02:01:42.320 --> 02:01:43.320]  They use us.
[02:01:43.320 --> 02:01:45.460]  They cannot do it on their own.
[02:01:45.460 --> 02:01:47.599]  So you have to get to the mind.
[02:01:47.599 --> 02:01:49.440]  So we have to organize.
[02:01:49.440 --> 02:01:54.240]  It's scary to me because I don't think there's nowhere to run like 1776.
[02:01:54.240 --> 02:01:56.519]  So I think we are going to divide within.
[02:01:56.519 --> 02:01:58.839]  A lot of people are going to move around in this country.
[02:01:58.839 --> 02:02:05.679]  It's going to be a divided state and I see a lot of the red or whatever that's against
[02:02:05.679 --> 02:02:08.959]  whatever's going on in there right now and I see what's going on.
[02:02:08.959 --> 02:02:13.120]  They are going to have to move in different areas and we are probably going to go out
[02:02:13.120 --> 02:02:18.920]  with these people for a while and it really comes down to what we said in the military.
[02:02:18.920 --> 02:02:24.679]  It's all God, country, family and if anything goes against those things then you need to
[02:02:24.679 --> 02:02:26.280]  question who's in there.
[02:02:26.280 --> 02:02:27.280]  I think people...
[02:02:27.280 --> 02:02:28.280]  Hold on.
[02:02:28.280 --> 02:02:29.599]  I'm going to let you finish your point because you're making really important points
[02:02:29.599 --> 02:02:35.480]  but I'm not blaming the people of Laina or Maui but most of them sat there while
[02:02:35.480 --> 02:02:38.839]  the cops said no you can't drive through and died.
[02:02:38.839 --> 02:02:43.580]  What you're saying is it's globalist punching buttons and then we all follow the orders
[02:02:43.580 --> 02:02:47.759]  and the police follow orders and the citizens follow orders and we all die and we have
[02:02:47.759 --> 02:02:53.000]  to give the mindset of no, if somebody's telling me something that goes against logic
[02:02:53.000 --> 02:02:57.120]  and common sense I'm not going to follow their orders because in many areas these
[02:02:57.120 --> 02:03:01.959]  governments are controlled by the technocrats who are literally killing us through the bureaucracy.
[02:03:01.959 --> 02:03:03.959]  It's an easy equation.
[02:03:03.959 --> 02:03:08.799]  They and BlackRock controlled power companies are not in many areas cutting back the power
[02:03:08.799 --> 02:03:09.799]  lines.
[02:03:09.799 --> 02:03:10.799]  Then they control that.
[02:03:10.799 --> 02:03:11.799]  They leave the power on.
[02:03:11.799 --> 02:03:13.719]  They know it's going to burn everything down.
[02:03:13.719 --> 02:03:16.679]  People need to look at that and say hey they're going to burn us down.
[02:03:16.679 --> 02:03:20.719]  The power lines are in brush and like you said you've got to look at all the ways they
[02:03:20.719 --> 02:03:24.400]  can kill you because they're not coming to kill you with a man with a gun and a blue
[02:03:24.400 --> 02:03:25.400]  helmet.
[02:03:25.400 --> 02:03:26.400]  They're going to kill you through a shot.
[02:03:26.400 --> 02:03:27.879]  They're going to kill you through GMO.
[02:03:27.879 --> 02:03:29.440]  They're going to kill you through 5G.
[02:03:29.440 --> 02:03:32.599]  They're going to kill you through electrical fires.
[02:03:32.599 --> 02:03:34.160]  Yes.
[02:03:34.160 --> 02:03:37.799]  We are at war people and that's what people don't realize.
[02:03:37.799 --> 02:03:42.240]  As soon as they look in the mirror and say that to themselves and they have that sobering
[02:03:42.240 --> 02:03:46.240]  thought that there is a 1% of the people out there that thinks there are too many
[02:03:46.240 --> 02:03:48.519]  of us which is complete BS.
[02:03:48.519 --> 02:03:52.480]  Anybody that's been on an airplane knows there is plenty of land everywhere.
[02:03:52.480 --> 02:03:53.480]  All over the place.
[02:03:53.480 --> 02:03:58.400]  It's just a matter of how many of us they can control and they got the God syndrome.
[02:03:58.400 --> 02:04:00.360]  So it all comes down to us.
[02:04:00.360 --> 02:04:02.420]  Do we do it or do we not do it?
[02:04:02.420 --> 02:04:04.160]  And Trump is not Jesus Christ.
[02:04:04.160 --> 02:04:06.200]  Jesus Christ has already came.
[02:04:06.200 --> 02:04:07.200]  He's already came and gone.
[02:04:07.200 --> 02:04:08.879]  This is up to us.
[02:04:08.879 --> 02:04:13.519]  So people quit standing in lines watching Trump and start doing something.
[02:04:13.519 --> 02:04:15.480]  I mean, the man's old anyway.
[02:04:15.480 --> 02:04:17.740]  It's not going to be around forever, okay?
[02:04:17.740 --> 02:04:19.559]  Jesus has come and gone.
[02:04:19.559 --> 02:04:20.559]  This is on us.
[02:04:20.720 --> 02:04:27.280]  I appreciate your call, Dave. Be safe in St. Louis. You're right. Our heads should
[02:04:27.280 --> 02:04:31.000]  be on swivels. We should be aware of what's going on. And we've got to know that we are
[02:04:31.000 --> 02:04:35.080]  under globalist attack. We'll be right back on the other side with more of your phone
[02:04:35.080 --> 02:04:43.000]  calls. Trace. And then Titus. And so many others. And then I'm gonna show you these
[02:04:43.000 --> 02:04:50.440]  videos and things out of Kauai, out of Lahaina, Maui. It's just disgusting. I mean it is
[02:04:50.440 --> 02:05:01.760]  cut and dry. They murdered those people. Wow. I've studied how the globalist, how the mad
[02:05:01.760 --> 02:05:07.240]  scientist are controlling us, and they're doing it by keeping us undernourished. You need
[02:05:07.240 --> 02:05:11.320]  all the food you want in the world. But if you don't have the essential vitamins
[02:05:11.320 --> 02:05:15.320]  and minerals in an organic, absorbable form, if you don't have the key elements like
[02:05:15.320 --> 02:05:21.240]  iodine, you are literally like someone in a paddle boat without ores, without paddles.
[02:05:21.240 --> 02:05:26.760]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are running a flash sale, as we're about to sell out of both of
[02:05:26.760 --> 02:05:35.480]  these, of X3 and vitamin fusion in the final days of August. This is a fundraiser. We'll
[02:05:35.480 --> 02:05:39.360]  sell out of this. I could sell it at full price. But I want those of you that have been
[02:05:39.360 --> 02:05:45.040]  on the fence and never tried X3 or never tried vitamin fusion to take action and try this
[02:05:45.040 --> 02:05:49.840]  product because I know you're going to be blown away by the energy, the stamina, the
[02:05:49.840 --> 02:05:56.560]  focus, the libido. This is so critical. Get your X3, environmental fusion for 40%
[02:05:56.560 --> 02:05:58.320]  off right now at mforestour.com.
[02:06:15.040 --> 02:06:23.000]  Trump is not going to save us as the last caller said, but realizing the deep states
[02:06:23.000 --> 02:06:27.200]  persecuting him and trying to destroy him to get to us and complete their coup over
[02:06:27.200 --> 02:06:32.880]  America is true. We should be praying for president Trump. We should be praying for
[02:06:32.880 --> 02:06:36.360]  the other institutions and groups and organizations that are fighting the new world
[02:06:36.360 --> 02:06:42.760]  order and are focal points to lead a resistance against this. Let's go ahead and talk to
[02:06:42.760 --> 02:06:49.800]  trace in North Dakota. Tracer on the air. Go ahead, Alex Jones. Welcome. God bless you,
[02:06:49.800 --> 02:06:53.680]  brother. Love you, man. Hope I get to shake your hand someday. I appreciate everything you
[02:06:53.680 --> 02:07:00.720]  do and I appreciate you, brother. Love you, man. Seriously. And it's hard to even go to
[02:07:00.720 --> 02:07:04.240]  what I was going to talk about just, you know, hearing you talk about Maui. I mean, I
[02:07:04.240 --> 02:07:10.560]  can't even think about that. It's so infuriating. But if you have a few minutes, I
[02:07:10.560 --> 02:07:14.680]  did have two points, but I think the second point was more important. But I'll
[02:07:14.680 --> 02:07:19.520]  do the first one quickly. I did time in the feds years ago, and I'm originally
[02:07:19.520 --> 02:07:23.640]  from Montana. And I don't know if you knew this, but every state has a federal
[02:07:23.640 --> 02:07:27.320]  defender office. It's like your court appointed attorney if you don't have one
[02:07:27.320 --> 02:07:31.600]  when the feds are charging you. Yes. And the one in Montana is in Great Falls. And
[02:07:31.600 --> 02:07:37.120]  that's where I was Casket County Jail. And my federal defender at the time, my attorney
[02:07:37.120 --> 02:07:41.480]  was David Ness, and the head federal defender was Tony Gallagher. And my
[02:07:41.480 --> 02:07:46.960]  attorney told me that Gallagher used to be a federal prosecutor, but he got so
[02:07:46.960 --> 02:07:51.360]  tired of seeing dudes, you know, taken away from their families and get put
[02:07:51.360 --> 02:07:54.960]  away for 30, 40 years that he went and he wanted to, he wanted to
[02:07:54.960 --> 02:07:59.120]  represent them and not put them away anymore. And I mean, I was in jail with
[02:07:59.120 --> 02:08:03.800]  grown men that come back from this one guy. This was 2003 and four, so he
[02:08:03.800 --> 02:08:08.280]  was like 60, but he came back crying from visiting and his daughter came
[02:08:08.280 --> 02:08:12.080]  in there and said the feds showed up at her and her husband, which would be his
[02:08:12.080 --> 02:08:16.280]  son-in-law, and like ripped through their house and and they were
[02:08:16.280 --> 02:08:20.400]  threatening to indict them if he didn't plead or what they wanted him to. That
[02:08:20.400 --> 02:08:24.680]  point was just that this was really bad, everything that's going on with
[02:08:24.680 --> 02:08:30.360]  with the Department of Justice, but I think it needed to happen. How bad the
[02:08:30.360 --> 02:08:36.160]  feds have been for so many years. They're just putting away people for 30, 40
[02:08:36.160 --> 02:08:39.840]  years, you know, and a little bit of dope or something, and for every
[02:08:39.840 --> 02:08:44.920]  gun they give them five years. And my girlfriend at the time, her
[02:08:44.920 --> 02:08:49.840]  grandfather was also in front of the feds, and they gave him five years for
[02:08:49.840 --> 02:08:54.920]  each gun. He was 63, and then he had like a World War I or II gun that
[02:08:54.920 --> 02:08:58.680]  his grandfather years ago gave him. I mean, we're talking 100 years, I don't
[02:08:58.680 --> 02:09:03.120]  know. A long time ago this gun was old, it doesn't even work, and they gave
[02:09:03.120 --> 02:09:06.960]  them five years for that. And they don't run them concurrent, they
[02:09:06.960 --> 02:09:10.560]  consecutive every gun, so they just add them up five years each, you know, 50
[02:09:10.560 --> 02:09:14.240]  years if you got 10 guns. Yeah, the federal government is overall a very
[02:09:14.240 --> 02:09:18.480]  parasitic organization. It's completely stood down on the border, it's aiding
[02:09:18.480 --> 02:09:23.040]  and abetting the human smuggling, and it is beyond disgusting. What was your
[02:09:23.040 --> 02:09:25.480]  take on Trump? You wanted to talk about Trump or you have something else to add?
[02:09:25.680 --> 02:09:31.240]  Well, I actually have kind of a two-part way to actually get, I think
[02:09:31.240 --> 02:09:35.600]  it's the only way we're going to get the country back. Doesn't Congress have
[02:09:35.600 --> 02:09:43.000]  a bailiff? They do, right? Yes. Okay, well, I know what a true bill is, I know
[02:09:43.000 --> 02:09:47.880]  that Congress doesn't have the power to formulate true bill indictments
[02:09:47.880 --> 02:09:50.800]  and have them served, but they have a bailiff and they have their own police
[02:09:50.800 --> 02:09:53.880]  force. I think they should call in Fauci and Mayorkas and all the other
[02:09:53.880 --> 02:09:59.480]  liars, have them testify in front of Congress and read back to them where
[02:09:59.480 --> 02:10:03.000]  they lied about something and arrest them on the spot. Have them arrested and
[02:10:03.000 --> 02:10:10.000]  detained, no bail, let the feds figure it out, but the
[02:10:10.000 --> 02:10:13.960]  patriots need to have visuals. The Democrats always use visuals. Trump's
[02:10:13.960 --> 02:10:19.560]  mugshot. I've done time in the feds, anything federal they
[02:10:19.560 --> 02:10:23.040]  try to charge, it's just going to get thrown out. Nothing he
[02:10:23.080 --> 02:10:27.120]  did was a crime. But statewide is where it's scary because they're going to try
[02:10:27.120 --> 02:10:29.920]  to threaten these other, you know, his co-defendants, they're going to
[02:10:29.920 --> 02:10:33.400]  threaten them with tons of years and they're going to get at least one or
[02:10:33.400 --> 02:10:36.900]  two of them to break. But I think they have to arrest these guys with
[02:10:36.900 --> 02:10:40.520]  their bailiffs in Congress in front of the American people. And then the
[02:10:40.520 --> 02:10:42.840]  American people that don't know what's going on will say, oh, hey, they
[02:10:42.840 --> 02:10:45.800]  arrested. Well, they must have been lying about something. They have to
[02:10:45.800 --> 02:10:52.960]  start taking a stand. I appreciate your call. Congress
[02:10:53.000 --> 02:10:56.560]  refers charges to the Justice Department. The problem is they've
[02:10:56.560 --> 02:10:59.360]  seized control of the Justice Department. That's why you see this
[02:10:59.360 --> 02:11:03.920]  incredible arrogance that's taking place. And they completely
[02:11:03.920 --> 02:11:09.480]  weaponize the Justice Department against the American people. And
[02:11:09.480 --> 02:11:14.120]  they admit that's their plan now. So it's going to take a pulling
[02:11:14.120 --> 02:11:17.480]  back from the government and just the public recognizing we have an
[02:11:17.480 --> 02:11:20.880]  illegitimate federal government. I mean, remember, the school board
[02:11:20.880 --> 02:11:24.960]  said, oh, we want the feds to come in and harass the people at
[02:11:24.960 --> 02:11:28.240]  the school boards. And then it was the feds told the school
[02:11:28.240 --> 02:11:33.720]  districts to call the feds. The feds now want to go muscle moms
[02:11:33.720 --> 02:11:37.200]  that don't want their seven year old being given pornographic
[02:11:37.440 --> 02:11:43.040]  pedophile literature. That if you try to read at the school
[02:11:43.040 --> 02:11:49.360]  district, you get arrested because it is indecent. Nobody's
[02:11:49.360 --> 02:11:52.880]  banning books. We're saying you don't give pedophile books with
[02:11:52.880 --> 02:11:55.720]  graphic images of little kids having sexual adults, and
[02:11:55.720 --> 02:11:59.120]  telling them how great it is to children. I've got video of
[02:11:59.120 --> 02:12:04.000]  that. I want to go to more calls here in a moment. But
[02:12:04.160 --> 02:12:08.800]  let's let's break some big news here. I told you last
[02:12:08.800 --> 02:12:12.600]  Friday, that my sources said they plan to roll the lockdowns
[02:12:12.600 --> 02:12:15.840]  back out, starting in the middle of September. That 100%
[02:12:15.840 --> 02:12:18.720]  happened, I told you on my children. And he showed all the
[02:12:18.760 --> 02:12:22.360]  other big news we break most of that sources. And my sources are
[02:12:22.360 --> 02:12:27.560]  accurate 95% of the time, because sometimes the power
[02:12:27.560 --> 02:12:31.040]  structure changes course. But my sources are good. They're
[02:12:31.040 --> 02:12:36.920]  people in the inside. And you saw it all roll out the last
[02:12:36.920 --> 02:12:47.000]  few days. universities, hotels, Hollywood production companies,
[02:12:47.320 --> 02:12:49.680]  going back to mass going back to you got to have the shots, you
[02:12:49.680 --> 02:12:54.360]  can't work here. And then calls to return to the
[02:12:54.360 --> 02:12:58.520]  controls, all over CNN, all over BBC, it's a global all
[02:12:58.520 --> 02:13:03.080]  over Australia news. It's a unified UN globalist program.
[02:13:03.200 --> 02:13:06.080]  When you're seeing the same newscast with the same talking
[02:13:06.080 --> 02:13:08.480]  points the same day, all over the world. That's a
[02:13:08.480 --> 02:13:18.280]  concerted, organized operation. Well, now we have this South
[02:13:18.280 --> 02:13:21.760]  Texas school district closes over COVID-19 surge my San
[02:13:21.760 --> 02:13:26.240]  Antonio calm. The school district nearly two hours south
[02:13:26.400 --> 02:13:30.000]  east of San Antonio is closing its doors until next week.
[02:13:30.440 --> 02:13:33.440]  Claim the COVID-19 cases have jumped on its campuses.
[02:13:33.440 --> 02:13:39.200]  Roange ISD announced Wednesday, August 23 that it will be
[02:13:39.200 --> 02:13:43.320]  shutting down the rest of the week until Tuesday, August 29
[02:13:43.320 --> 02:13:50.720]  according to KEN KENS five school district against South
[02:13:50.720 --> 02:13:55.880]  Texas temporary closes. This is all to create the fear. As
[02:13:55.880 --> 02:14:00.200]  COVID cases flare some schools and businesses reinstate mask
[02:14:00.200 --> 02:14:07.280]  mandate, CBS News. So see, I told you, this is the fear.
[02:14:08.080 --> 02:14:11.160]  This is the rollout. Because we weren't buying the global
[02:14:11.160 --> 02:14:16.960]  boiling. Well now send in the new COVID variant. The head of
[02:14:16.960 --> 02:14:22.320]  the British response who coordinated with Fauci and
[02:14:22.320 --> 02:14:27.800]  Gates in his text messages that came out last year said it's
[02:14:27.800 --> 02:14:31.040]  time to release the new variant that will scare them
[02:14:31.240 --> 02:14:35.400]  into submission. Here's another one. Reggie Cheney
[02:14:35.440 --> 02:14:38.800]  college basketball star who helped lead Houston the final
[02:14:38.800 --> 02:14:44.520]  four in 2021 dies at age 23. You want to guess what he
[02:14:44.520 --> 02:14:51.440]  died of? It's the same thing over and over again. Now
[02:14:51.440 --> 02:14:58.400]  they've got articles telling you Oh, sorry. The COVID shots
[02:14:58.400 --> 02:15:02.640]  don't work. And they never worked. Other than making you
[02:15:02.640 --> 02:15:07.520]  sick. Now I mentioned this last hour from the big interview
[02:15:07.520 --> 02:15:10.800]  when I say big. Last time I checked was a 300 something
[02:15:10.800 --> 02:15:13.640]  million. Let's go to Tucker Carlson's Twitter account on
[02:15:13.640 --> 02:15:18.520]  X. Last time I checked it was 240 million. Let's see what it
[02:15:18.520 --> 02:15:24.760]  is now. I haven't checked since last night. Fox's whole thing
[02:15:24.760 --> 02:15:28.640]  at 5 million viewers. See, it's a paper tiger. It represents
[02:15:28.640 --> 02:15:31.560]  the establishment. Nobody believes it. Except a few
[02:15:31.560 --> 02:15:36.480]  fools. But I asked the crew I said, I said, I thought that
[02:15:36.480 --> 02:15:39.440]  one of the most powerful points Trump made was, I'm
[02:15:39.440 --> 02:15:41.160]  aware of the deep state now I know how the federal
[02:15:41.160 --> 02:15:43.560]  government works. Now, when I get back in, I'll be able to
[02:15:43.560 --> 02:15:52.040]  stop them. 255 point 7 million years. What I estimated
[02:15:52.040 --> 02:15:56.760]  would get 300, 4 million views. I don't remember. I
[02:15:56.760 --> 02:16:00.600]  guess 500, five million by Monday. We'll see if I'm
[02:16:00.600 --> 02:16:04.680]  right. But there it is. And here's that key clip in
[02:16:04.680 --> 02:16:12.200]  my view. Key takeaway. Here it is. Yeah, you could say
[02:16:12.200 --> 02:16:16.320]  that they do things that are not very. So how do you
[02:16:16.320 --> 02:16:18.360]  can, that's my question. How do you, if you get
[02:16:18.360 --> 02:16:21.480]  elected again, go back to Washington, how do you keep
[02:16:21.480 --> 02:16:24.640]  the agencies under control? How do you keep FBI and CIA
[02:16:24.640 --> 02:16:27.160]  specifically under control? The way you do it, like I
[02:16:27.160 --> 02:16:29.000]  fired Comey, that was a big deal. You know, a lot
[02:16:29.000 --> 02:16:31.080]  of people said, and I fired him very early. Somebody said,
[02:16:31.080 --> 02:16:33.280]  Oh, I wish you would have fired him. There's a real
[02:16:33.280 --> 02:16:35.680]  question about firing him anyway. You understand because
[02:16:35.680 --> 02:16:37.800]  you know, when they have a 10 year term, there is a
[02:16:37.800 --> 02:16:41.320]  question. I fired Comey. That was a great thing. If I
[02:16:41.320 --> 02:16:43.560]  didn't fire Comey, maybe I wouldn't be talking to you
[02:16:43.560 --> 02:16:45.120]  or I'd be talking to you about real estate or
[02:16:45.120 --> 02:16:48.080]  something else other than politics, right? That was a
[02:16:48.080 --> 02:16:50.760]  coup, in my opinion. That was a very sick deal. That
[02:16:50.760 --> 02:16:53.680]  was the insurance policy. You remember the insurance
[02:16:53.680 --> 02:16:56.800]  policy? Oh, she's going to win, darling. She's going
[02:16:56.800 --> 02:16:59.600]  to win. But just in case she doesn't, we have an
[02:16:59.600 --> 02:17:02.120]  insurance policy and insurance policy was what they
[02:17:02.160 --> 02:17:05.640]  were doing. And we caught them with that. That was
[02:17:05.640 --> 02:17:09.600]  a very important tweet or whatever it was, text. It
[02:17:09.600 --> 02:17:12.520]  was a big deal. That was a big deal. The
[02:17:12.520 --> 02:17:17.320]  insurance policy, she's going to win 100 million to
[02:17:17.320 --> 02:17:19.360]  one. That's not good odds. At least they gave me
[02:17:19.360 --> 02:17:24.120]  one, right? 100 million to one. But just in case she
[02:17:24.120 --> 02:17:26.960]  doesn't win, we have an insurance policy. And
[02:17:26.960 --> 02:17:30.240]  everybody said, that's strange. That's strange. But
[02:17:30.240 --> 02:17:34.120]  we caught all that because I fired Comey, because when
[02:17:34.120 --> 02:17:37.560]  I fired Comey, it was like throwing a rock into a
[02:17:37.560 --> 02:17:41.280]  hornet's nest, into a nest of bees and the place
[02:17:41.280 --> 02:17:44.400]  went crazy. So when you were president, are you
[02:17:44.400 --> 02:17:47.440]  confident that you knew everything, say, CIA was
[02:17:47.440 --> 02:17:51.320]  doing? No, I'm not. I'm not. It's a very
[02:17:51.320 --> 02:17:53.160]  interesting group of people. I had very good
[02:17:53.160 --> 02:17:55.560]  relationships, I thought, but I was a little
[02:17:55.560 --> 02:18:00.840]  surprised when I got out that, you know, things go
[02:18:00.840 --> 02:18:03.720]  on. Look, it's. What were you surprised by? I
[02:18:03.720 --> 02:18:05.920]  was surprised. I think it's some of the people I
[02:18:05.920 --> 02:18:08.600]  was surprised that there was I had a group
[02:18:08.600 --> 02:18:12.320]  of people. We killed many using the CIA. I have
[02:18:12.320 --> 02:18:16.000]  to say this bad, very bad actors. We were very
[02:18:16.000 --> 02:18:19.800]  good at it. You look at Soleimani, you look at
[02:18:19.800 --> 02:18:22.760]  al-Baghdadi bigger than Osama bin Laden. I mean,
[02:18:22.800 --> 02:18:27.760]  Osama bin Laden is, but al-Baghdadi did ISIS and he
[02:18:27.760 --> 02:18:30.240]  was rebuilding ISIS very strongly. And that was the
[02:18:30.240 --> 02:18:33.520]  CIA that did that. That was really us that
[02:18:33.520 --> 02:18:36.640]  did that. That was really us that did that. And
[02:18:36.640 --> 02:18:39.960]  Soleimani was us that did that. Not so much
[02:18:39.960 --> 02:18:44.200]  CIA, but we did some very good work with
[02:18:44.200 --> 02:18:47.760]  the CIA. What I started, you know, you know, no
[02:18:47.760 --> 02:18:50.240]  big deal with the crew, but we'll play this
[02:18:50.240 --> 02:18:52.520]  on Sunday or Monday. So let's let's write a note
[02:18:52.520 --> 02:18:56.720]  here. This is what he said on the show. This is
[02:18:56.720 --> 02:19:00.040]  what I want. He said, this is basically a quote
[02:19:00.040 --> 02:19:05.480]  of it. So we know the clip I want. He said, I
[02:19:05.480 --> 02:19:08.160]  didn't know how D.C. worked when I got in. I
[02:19:08.160 --> 02:19:09.840]  didn't know how bad it was. I didn't know how
[02:19:09.840 --> 02:19:12.440]  corrupt it was. I know how it works now. When
[02:19:12.440 --> 02:19:14.520]  I get back in, I'll be able to stop them and
[02:19:14.520 --> 02:19:16.880]  I'm going to remove them. That's the clip I
[02:19:16.880 --> 02:19:19.880]  want. That's the key to the whole hour long
[02:19:19.880 --> 02:19:24.680]  interview. I didn't know how it worked before. Now
[02:19:24.680 --> 02:19:27.320]  I know how it works now. And I know he
[02:19:27.320 --> 02:19:29.760]  said it because I watched it. All right. No big
[02:19:29.760 --> 02:19:32.400]  deal. But I didn't want to just get him to
[02:19:32.400 --> 02:19:34.480]  talk about the CIA meeting with the state. He
[02:19:34.480 --> 02:19:38.960]  specifically said, I know how D.C. works now. I
[02:19:38.960 --> 02:19:43.120]  didn't know before. I'm going to be able to
[02:19:43.120 --> 02:19:45.480]  stop it the next time. And he said similar
[02:19:45.480 --> 02:19:47.160]  speeches about I'm going to war with the deep
[02:19:47.160 --> 02:19:49.920]  state. It's us or them. Final battle. We're
[02:19:49.920 --> 02:19:52.880]  going to remove them. Doesn't matter. 240
[02:19:52.880 --> 02:19:54.520]  million people saw it. You know what he said.
[02:19:54.800 --> 02:19:57.440]  But that's what he said. I'll probably watch it
[02:19:57.440 --> 02:19:59.520]  again tonight. I'll get the time codes and I'll
[02:19:59.520 --> 02:20:01.240]  get the clips I want. You know, we just had
[02:20:01.240 --> 02:20:03.400]  so much other news that I haven't given this
[02:20:03.400 --> 02:20:05.480]  interview the attention it needed. That's my
[02:20:05.480 --> 02:20:08.120]  fault. It's not right to tell the crew, go find
[02:20:08.120 --> 02:20:09.920]  the deep state clip and then we don't. But say
[02:20:09.920 --> 02:20:12.360]  it again. Just one more time. He said, I
[02:20:12.360 --> 02:20:14.920]  didn't know how D.C. worked before. I know how
[02:20:14.920 --> 02:20:18.440]  D.C. works now. I didn't know how D.C. worked
[02:20:18.440 --> 02:20:21.360]  before. I know how D.C. works now. That's the
[02:20:21.360 --> 02:20:23.360]  clip I'm looking for. All right. Let's go to
[02:20:23.360 --> 02:20:24.960]  Joe in Florida. Joe, thanks for holding your
[02:20:24.960 --> 02:20:28.040]  on the air. Hey, Alex, thanks for having me
[02:20:28.040 --> 02:20:30.640]  on. I'm sorry. Not feeling well. I said a
[02:20:30.640 --> 02:20:36.600]  little prayer for you while I was waiting. I
[02:20:37.360 --> 02:20:38.760]  well, real quick, before I get to my main
[02:20:38.760 --> 02:20:40.280]  point, I just want to say that Larry Alex
[02:20:40.600 --> 02:20:42.440]  pointed out that we do need to fix the
[02:20:42.440 --> 02:20:44.240]  ballot situation, you know, go with paper
[02:20:44.240 --> 02:20:48.080]  ballots because who knows how much they can
[02:20:48.080 --> 02:20:51.480]  steal. But the main thing I wanted to tell you
[02:20:51.480 --> 02:20:56.640]  about was that Vivek Ramaswamy, I've been like
[02:20:56.640 --> 02:20:58.200]  red in the face, if you could become red in
[02:20:58.200 --> 02:20:59.960]  the face from posting things on social media
[02:21:00.680 --> 02:21:02.520]  about trying to get people to understand that
[02:21:02.520 --> 02:21:05.400]  this guy would almost be like an electing a
[02:21:05.400 --> 02:21:09.040]  Fauci because he's directly involved in
[02:21:09.040 --> 02:21:13.000]  biotech. He developed the lipid nanoparticles
[02:21:13.040 --> 02:21:16.560]  through his subsidiary of Rovant called
[02:21:16.560 --> 02:21:19.800]  Genovant. They make lipid nanoparticles. They
[02:21:19.800 --> 02:21:23.480]  say, quote, best in class lipid nanoparticle
[02:21:23.480 --> 02:21:25.440]  RNA products is what they make on their
[02:21:25.440 --> 02:21:28.240]  website. And they're suing Pfizer for using
[02:21:28.240 --> 02:21:31.920]  the lipid nanoparticle delivery technology. Oh,
[02:21:31.920 --> 02:21:34.520]  yeah. I mean, look, Vivek Ramaswamy's not been
[02:21:34.520 --> 02:21:36.000]  around long enough to know whether he's good or
[02:21:36.000 --> 02:21:38.680]  bad. I know he's suing DevoScript for saying
[02:21:38.680 --> 02:21:40.920]  they said he's part of them or whatever. So I
[02:21:40.960 --> 02:21:43.840]  mean, his rhetoric's really good right now. And
[02:21:43.840 --> 02:21:45.560]  that's why he's so popular. But but, yeah, I
[02:21:45.560 --> 02:21:47.320]  mean, I don't think we've got enough track
[02:21:47.320 --> 02:21:49.760]  record with him. He was a lot of the things
[02:21:49.760 --> 02:21:52.680]  that he says. But I mean, after, you know, as
[02:21:52.680 --> 02:21:54.520]  much effort as we've all put into trying to
[02:21:54.520 --> 02:21:57.480]  expose this medical tyranny. And I know how, you
[02:21:57.480 --> 02:22:00.320]  know, I really appreciate your work on that. I
[02:22:00.320 --> 02:22:01.560]  just can't believe that we would be
[02:22:01.560 --> 02:22:05.120]  considering electing a guy who literally makes the
[02:22:05.120 --> 02:22:07.240]  shots, basically. I mean, he makes the lipid
[02:22:07.240 --> 02:22:10.240]  nanoparticle RNA, which we know is really,
[02:22:10.240 --> 02:22:12.440]  really, really bad. That's a great point.
[02:22:12.480 --> 02:22:13.240]  Anything else?
[02:22:15.040 --> 02:22:18.040]  Well, you know, biotech is also the field
[02:22:18.040 --> 02:22:22.120]  that's brought us GMOs, like BT corn, which BT
[02:22:22.120 --> 02:22:26.520]  corn, you know, it's it's a BT toxin, which
[02:22:26.520 --> 02:22:29.720]  we actually use in organic crop production. I'm
[02:22:29.720 --> 02:22:30.640]  a horticulturalist.
[02:22:30.680 --> 02:22:33.720]  Yeah, so bugs bugs die from eating it. But it's
[02:22:33.720 --> 02:22:34.600]  okay for us to eat.
[02:22:35.280 --> 02:22:37.260]  Well, it's not okay for us to eat
[02:22:37.260 --> 02:22:38.160]  necessarily. And it's
[02:22:39.120 --> 02:22:40.080]  I'm being sarcastic.
[02:22:40.120 --> 02:22:43.000]  But well, right, right. But But the thing is
[02:22:43.000 --> 02:22:45.520]  about it is in organic production, you can spray
[02:22:45.520 --> 02:22:47.400]  it on and it can be rinsed off by rain or
[02:22:47.400 --> 02:22:50.880]  irrigation water. But a GMO corn plant, I
[02:22:50.880 --> 02:22:51.920]  don't even want to call it a plant because
[02:22:51.920 --> 02:22:54.360]  it's a hybrid between a plant and a bacterium.
[02:22:54.640 --> 02:22:58.200]  It, it actually makes that bacteria that toxin
[02:22:58.200 --> 02:23:01.040]  the BT toxin in every cell in the plant. And
[02:23:01.040 --> 02:23:03.000]  so you're eating that toxin when you eat it.
[02:23:03.000 --> 02:23:04.960]  The only reason we don't die right away from
[02:23:04.960 --> 02:23:09.960]  eating BT corn is because we have an acidic gut,
[02:23:10.000 --> 02:23:13.320]  whereas a caterpillar has an alkaline gut. It's
[02:23:13.320 --> 02:23:15.440]  like the opposite. And it's that. And also, we
[02:23:15.440 --> 02:23:17.760]  don't just only eat corn, but there are, you
[02:23:17.760 --> 02:23:19.600]  know, long term effects from eating this stuff.
[02:23:19.920 --> 02:23:23.040]  And then the other, you know, big bad. Another
[02:23:23.040 --> 02:23:25.600]  one of the bad GMOs is the Roundup ready soy
[02:23:25.600 --> 02:23:28.520]  because they blanket spray these fields with
[02:23:28.520 --> 02:23:31.520]  Roundup, because the soy is resistant to it. And
[02:23:31.520 --> 02:23:34.320]  now every freshwater source in the world has
[02:23:34.320 --> 02:23:37.320]  detectable levels of glyphosate. And then of
[02:23:37.320 --> 02:23:41.120]  course, another biotech problem that that
[02:23:41.120 --> 02:23:43.040]  industry brought about is the gain of function
[02:23:43.080 --> 02:23:45.360]  pathogens, which we all know what that's brought
[02:23:45.360 --> 02:23:51.280]  us with the, you know, plandemic. And, well,
[02:23:51.360 --> 02:23:54.360]  another bad thing about Ramaswamy Newsmax reported
[02:23:54.360 --> 02:23:58.120]  a couple days ago that he took $90,000 from
[02:23:58.120 --> 02:24:01.120]  George Soros's family for his scholar for not a
[02:24:01.120 --> 02:24:03.960]  scholarship, but as a grant to attend Yale Law
[02:24:03.960 --> 02:24:05.880]  School, and he claimed that he needed the money
[02:24:05.880 --> 02:24:07.800]  at the time, but actually, he reported to the
[02:24:07.800 --> 02:24:09.000]  IRS that he made $2 million.
[02:24:09.520 --> 02:24:11.560]  All right, well, I got it. Vivek Ramaswamy's
[02:24:11.560 --> 02:24:13.920]  got some issues. Great points. Thank you so
[02:24:13.920 --> 02:24:16.800]  much. And the realer, the bigger issue is
[02:24:16.920 --> 02:24:19.240]  everything you said is admitted about all this
[02:24:19.240 --> 02:24:21.960]  BT corn, all this other stuff. And it's just
[02:24:21.960 --> 02:24:24.120]  killing us. And that's why our live expectancy is
[02:24:24.120 --> 02:24:26.320]  going down. Everybody's so sick. Little kids are
[02:24:26.320 --> 02:24:28.480]  getting cancer everywhere. And this is the world
[02:24:28.480 --> 02:24:30.040]  the average bureaucrat wants to live in, the
[02:24:30.040 --> 02:24:33.080]  average globalist, the average minion. And the
[02:24:33.080 --> 02:24:34.640]  people sit there when the cops say, No, you
[02:24:34.640 --> 02:24:36.680]  can't leave down the road with no fire. The fire
[02:24:36.680 --> 02:24:39.520]  is 100 yards behind you. Just stay right there.
[02:24:39.560 --> 02:24:43.800]  You're gonna die now. That works. Cabin in
[02:24:43.800 --> 02:24:45.480]  Seattle. Thanks for calling. Go ahead.
[02:24:46.880 --> 02:24:48.800]  Hey, Alex, how's it going? Longtime listener,
[02:24:48.800 --> 02:24:51.360]  big fan. I'm a part of the age group that
[02:24:51.360 --> 02:24:53.360]  frequently gets talked down upon and that
[02:24:53.400 --> 02:24:55.640]  demoralization and miseducation has really
[02:24:55.680 --> 02:24:58.240]  rotted a lot of people's brains, I know. And
[02:24:58.240 --> 02:24:59.840]  we've been misguided for a long time. But
[02:24:59.840 --> 02:25:01.560]  thanks to you and others on your program, I've
[02:25:01.560 --> 02:25:03.640]  been able to get rid of some of the rot. But
[02:25:03.640 --> 02:25:05.920]  where things I can do to bring real change, I
[02:25:05.920 --> 02:25:08.440]  can see in my community. I feel sometimes the
[02:25:08.440 --> 02:25:10.960]  power structures too powerful for me to do
[02:25:10.960 --> 02:25:13.080]  anything. But like, that's where they want us
[02:25:13.080 --> 02:25:15.360]  to be. But I'm tired of seeing hate winning
[02:25:15.360 --> 02:25:18.120]  and evil thriving. So what I what advice would
[02:25:18.120 --> 02:25:19.800]  you have for young men like myself and
[02:25:19.800 --> 02:25:22.120]  others out there to that really just hate
[02:25:22.120 --> 02:25:24.680]  what's going on right now? Well, I mean, I
[02:25:24.680 --> 02:25:26.200]  wouldn't be a victim. You're on a beautiful
[02:25:26.200 --> 02:25:28.680]  planet, a beautiful universe, with amazing
[02:25:28.680 --> 02:25:30.960]  stuff all around you and realize that there's
[02:25:30.960 --> 02:25:32.360]  some really bad people that want to control
[02:25:32.360 --> 02:25:34.360]  the future when he uses his guinea pigs, who
[02:25:34.360 --> 02:25:38.040]  want to play God, and that that this is the
[02:25:38.040 --> 02:25:40.040]  animated contest liberty. And so it's an
[02:25:40.040 --> 02:25:47.120]  incredibly dangerous, dynamic, wild, scary,
[02:25:47.560 --> 02:25:49.880]  but also invigorating, empowering time to be
[02:25:49.880 --> 02:25:53.640]  alive. And as the new world order can help
[02:25:53.640 --> 02:25:55.120]  but want to kill everybody and take full
[02:25:55.120 --> 02:25:58.400]  control. As it tries to carry this out, you're
[02:25:58.400 --> 02:26:02.480]  just going to see opposition ramp up. And the
[02:26:02.480 --> 02:26:04.160]  enemy can't help their nature. So they're
[02:26:04.160 --> 02:26:07.320]  gonna keep attacking no matter what. So we're
[02:26:07.320 --> 02:26:08.640]  going to win this in the end one way or
[02:26:08.640 --> 02:26:11.440]  another, but it's going to be spectacular.
[02:26:11.800 --> 02:26:14.040]  And so I would just realize that doesn't
[02:26:14.040 --> 02:26:15.800]  matter how nice your car is doesn't matter
[02:26:15.800 --> 02:26:17.960]  how cool you are. None of that stuff
[02:26:17.960 --> 02:26:19.400]  matters. What matters is your relationship with
[02:26:19.400 --> 02:26:21.160]  God. And what matters is how you're
[02:26:21.160 --> 02:26:22.880]  engaged in forming others have the
[02:26:22.880 --> 02:26:25.120]  confidence to do that. And that at the end
[02:26:25.120 --> 02:26:27.840]  of the day, exposing the new world order is
[02:26:27.840 --> 02:26:30.320]  the most important thing we can do. And
[02:26:30.360 --> 02:26:34.600]  and then conversely, exposing the gods real
[02:26:34.760 --> 02:26:36.000]  and the people have a choice to make
[02:26:36.200 --> 02:26:36.920]  anything else?
[02:26:37.920 --> 02:26:39.560]  That's it. I hope to have a beer with you
[02:26:39.560 --> 02:26:41.360]  one day. Follow me at swerving media on
[02:26:41.360 --> 02:26:41.760]  YouTube.
[02:26:42.400 --> 02:26:44.000]  Say that again. You said it real quick.
[02:26:44.000 --> 02:26:44.960]  Where we follow you on Twitter?
[02:26:45.800 --> 02:26:48.200]  On on YouTube swerving media.
[02:26:48.600 --> 02:26:49.400]  swerving?
[02:26:50.320 --> 02:26:53.200]  Yeah, SWERVIN media.
[02:26:53.240 --> 02:26:55.520]  No, I got it. I got it. Thank you so much,
[02:26:55.520 --> 02:26:57.600]  Kevin. All right, let's jam in one more
[02:26:57.600 --> 02:26:59.160]  call to come back cover the Maui
[02:26:59.160 --> 02:27:01.000]  information. Tony and George, you got a
[02:27:01.000 --> 02:27:02.200]  minute 55 seconds.
[02:27:03.960 --> 02:27:07.560]  Yes, sir. Thank you for taking my call. I
[02:27:07.560 --> 02:27:10.440]  just got a few points. The lady that
[02:27:10.520 --> 02:27:12.760]  said yesterday or the other day that
[02:27:12.760 --> 02:27:18.040]  was a lawyer that said all of the
[02:27:18.040 --> 02:27:21.600]  administration of Biden was didn't have
[02:27:21.600 --> 02:27:25.160]  any notarized alpha David. So is the
[02:27:25.160 --> 02:27:27.960]  administration is illegal. Well, bad.
[02:27:28.240 --> 02:27:33.240]  So my thing is, is we run 98% of the
[02:27:33.240 --> 02:27:35.960]  country, the conservatives do, or the
[02:27:35.960 --> 02:27:40.120]  counties 98% counties. We are we are
[02:27:40.120 --> 02:27:42.400]  allowed self defense. So when they do
[02:27:42.400 --> 02:27:46.520]  this new lockdown, we make a rest. You
[02:27:46.520 --> 02:27:48.400]  have four to eight members of your
[02:27:48.400 --> 02:27:51.280]  team when you're just make a rest of
[02:27:51.280 --> 02:27:55.120]  people that go along with system. And
[02:27:55.600 --> 02:27:57.560]  the reason is, is because you can charge
[02:27:57.560 --> 02:28:01.840]  him with attempted murder, because the
[02:28:02.600 --> 02:28:05.240]  lockdowns and the masks have been went
[02:28:05.240 --> 02:28:06.560]  through a court of law saying the
[02:28:06.560 --> 02:28:08.160]  mask give you a bacteria and
[02:28:08.160 --> 02:28:10.200]  ammonia and in the lockdowns have
[02:28:10.200 --> 02:28:13.080]  killed people. So that is my
[02:28:13.800 --> 02:28:15.040]  Well, that's right. They're attempts to
[02:28:15.040 --> 02:28:17.360]  put us under house arrest and killed a
[02:28:17.360 --> 02:28:18.680]  bunch of people and have been
[02:28:18.680 --> 02:28:20.480]  adjudicated to be illegal. And I
[02:28:20.480 --> 02:28:22.720]  agree. grand juries and stuff should
[02:28:22.720 --> 02:28:24.040]  get together and indict these local
[02:28:24.040 --> 02:28:25.560]  health officials that are on the
[02:28:25.560 --> 02:28:27.280]  globalist payroll and stop this deadness
[02:28:27.280 --> 02:28:28.840]  tracks and no one should comply with
[02:28:28.840 --> 02:28:29.280]  any of it.
[02:28:33.200 --> 02:28:35.240]  God bless you. All right, that's it
[02:28:35.240 --> 02:28:37.880]  for calls. I'm going to come back and
[02:28:37.880 --> 02:28:40.440]  get into the Maui information. And it
[02:28:40.440 --> 02:28:43.280]  is disgusting beyond belief. But it
[02:28:43.280 --> 02:28:47.240]  really happened. Again, they can do
[02:28:47.240 --> 02:28:48.200]  this to these folks, they can do it
[02:28:48.200 --> 02:28:51.120]  to anybody. This is just mass murder,
[02:28:51.800 --> 02:28:54.560]  administrative mass murder. We'll be
[02:28:54.560 --> 02:28:58.040]  right back in footworks.com. I've
[02:28:58.040 --> 02:29:00.800]  studied how the globalist how the mad
[02:29:00.800 --> 02:29:02.960]  scientists are controlling us. And
[02:29:02.960 --> 02:29:04.720]  they're doing it by keeping us
[02:29:04.720 --> 02:29:06.680]  undernourished. You need all the
[02:29:06.680 --> 02:29:07.840]  food you want in the world. But if
[02:29:07.840 --> 02:29:10.360]  you don't have the essential vitamins
[02:29:10.360 --> 02:29:12.400]  and minerals in an organic absorbable
[02:29:12.400 --> 02:29:13.880]  form, if you don't have the key

[02:33:11.480 --> 02:33:12.680]  The crew did find the clip,
[02:33:12.720 --> 02:33:13.600]  did a great job on the way
[02:33:13.600 --> 02:33:15.080]  finding it. He elaborated more,
[02:33:15.080 --> 02:33:17.000]  but for president Trump to
[02:33:17.000 --> 02:33:18.600]  admit he didn't know how DC
[02:33:18.600 --> 02:33:20.480]  ran, but now he does know
[02:33:20.480 --> 02:33:22.440]  and he elaborated on it. Will
[02:33:22.440 --> 02:33:24.400]  in post put the fuller clip
[02:33:24.400 --> 02:33:26.080]  in. Once we post this to
[02:33:26.080 --> 02:33:27.240]  Bandai video letters, they
[02:33:27.240 --> 02:33:28.200]  obviously can't do that now
[02:33:28.200 --> 02:33:30.320]  because we're live, but
[02:33:30.320 --> 02:33:31.280]  that's quite an admission from
[02:33:31.280 --> 02:33:32.240]  Trump. It never wants to say
[02:33:32.240 --> 02:33:33.920]  he's wrong or didn't know
[02:33:33.920 --> 02:33:34.800]  what was going on. He should
[02:33:34.800 --> 02:33:36.000]  do more of that. That's good.
[02:33:36.080 --> 02:33:36.600]  Here it is.
[02:33:37.600 --> 02:33:38.680]  Well, I had great people.
[02:33:38.720 --> 02:33:40.160]  We'll have even better people
[02:33:40.160 --> 02:33:41.160]  if we do this because now I
[02:33:41.160 --> 02:33:42.400]  know Washington before I didn't
[02:33:42.400 --> 02:33:44.280]  know Washington, but guys like
[02:33:44.280 --> 02:33:45.520]  Bill Barr were terrible. I
[02:33:45.520 --> 02:33:47.400]  mean, they were. Then he
[02:33:47.400 --> 02:33:48.440]  went on and elaborated and
[02:33:48.440 --> 02:33:49.440]  went through the bad guys
[02:33:49.440 --> 02:33:50.480]  and who the good guys were.
[02:33:51.200 --> 02:33:53.400]  Let's now go ahead and
[02:33:53.480 --> 02:33:54.920]  start going to this footage
[02:33:55.280 --> 02:33:56.240]  because we had the witnesses
[02:33:56.240 --> 02:33:57.480]  that said they saw this. Now
[02:33:57.480 --> 02:33:58.600]  AP talked to the police. They
[02:33:58.600 --> 02:33:59.320]  admitted, yeah, we were
[02:33:59.320 --> 02:34:00.880]  ordered to block people on the
[02:34:00.880 --> 02:34:01.920]  main road going out. Even though
[02:34:01.920 --> 02:34:02.920]  the fire was coming the other
[02:34:02.920 --> 02:34:04.960]  direction, that would be like
[02:34:05.800 --> 02:34:07.040]  it was a 10 story apartment
[02:34:07.040 --> 02:34:08.840]  building. The old fashioned
[02:34:08.840 --> 02:34:09.960]  ones that have the fire escape
[02:34:09.960 --> 02:34:13.280]  on the outside and or on the
[02:34:13.280 --> 02:34:16.040]  inside, you got the stairs and
[02:34:16.040 --> 02:34:17.880]  the building's on fire. And
[02:34:17.880 --> 02:34:18.800]  then people get to the second
[02:34:18.800 --> 02:34:19.720]  floor and there's cops with
[02:34:19.720 --> 02:34:21.320]  guns saying you can't leave
[02:34:21.320 --> 02:34:22.320]  the building. And they're like,
[02:34:22.680 --> 02:34:23.920]  well, the fire's up there.
[02:34:24.680 --> 02:34:25.840]  We're on the fire escape or
[02:34:25.840 --> 02:34:27.160]  you're coming on the outside
[02:34:27.160 --> 02:34:28.280]  of the fire escape. Police are
[02:34:28.280 --> 02:34:30.040]  on a bullhorn saying you are
[02:34:30.040 --> 02:34:31.840]  not allowed to come down. You
[02:34:31.880 --> 02:34:33.640]  go, why? I've been ordered to
[02:34:33.640 --> 02:34:34.880]  not let you come down. Well,
[02:34:34.920 --> 02:34:37.200]  there's a fire and that an
[02:34:37.200 --> 02:34:38.920]  abnormal cop and normal world
[02:34:38.920 --> 02:34:40.560]  is under my control would say,
[02:34:40.560 --> 02:34:41.560]  yeah, come on down. Let me
[02:34:41.560 --> 02:34:44.360]  help you. And I've, I've been
[02:34:44.360 --> 02:34:45.920]  delaying him many times. I know
[02:34:45.920 --> 02:34:47.240]  it. We've seen the reports.
[02:34:47.240 --> 02:34:48.360]  The AP has confirmed everything
[02:34:48.360 --> 02:34:50.200]  we already said. They're
[02:34:50.200 --> 02:34:51.240]  literally trying to flee the
[02:34:51.240 --> 02:34:54.080]  flames coming this way. And
[02:34:54.080 --> 02:34:55.360]  the roads this way and they
[02:34:55.360 --> 02:34:56.120]  see the Hills and the
[02:34:56.120 --> 02:34:57.880]  mountains and it's wide open
[02:34:59.280 --> 02:35:00.520]  and they just block them in and
[02:35:00.520 --> 02:35:01.760]  burn their asses up. And
[02:35:01.760 --> 02:35:03.320]  then they only, some got out
[02:35:04.560 --> 02:35:06.600]  because the cops finally left.
[02:35:07.600 --> 02:35:09.120]  Now they found the power poles,
[02:35:09.720 --> 02:35:10.880]  the ones that didn't fall over
[02:35:10.960 --> 02:35:13.480]  hacked in key places with
[02:35:13.480 --> 02:35:17.520]  precision by axis. So they
[02:35:17.520 --> 02:35:19.800]  would fall over. Yeah. Folks
[02:35:19.800 --> 02:35:22.600]  wanted that land. And could it
[02:35:22.600 --> 02:35:24.160]  be locals and a conspiracy to
[02:35:24.160 --> 02:35:27.000]  do it? I don't know. Was it
[02:35:27.000 --> 02:35:28.760]  black rock who wouldn't cut the
[02:35:28.760 --> 02:35:30.240]  trees for five years and left
[02:35:30.240 --> 02:35:33.160]  the power on that's why they've
[02:35:33.160 --> 02:35:34.440]  got an exclusion zone. That's
[02:35:34.440 --> 02:35:35.640]  why they're covering up. That's
[02:35:35.640 --> 02:35:36.360]  why they're acting so
[02:35:36.360 --> 02:35:37.600]  suspicious because they've been
[02:35:37.600 --> 02:35:39.440]  caught folks in the most
[02:35:39.440 --> 02:35:41.960]  perfect negligence, hole in one
[02:35:42.200 --> 02:35:45.640]  negligence, pure 100% perfectly
[02:35:45.640 --> 02:35:46.920]  to hurt people just magically
[02:35:46.920 --> 02:35:49.120]  by accident. And that I give
[02:35:49.120 --> 02:35:50.360]  that 1% chance. That's real.
[02:35:52.680 --> 02:35:55.360]  No, ladies and gentlemen, it
[02:35:55.360 --> 02:35:57.040]  was default. It was set up. It
[02:35:57.040 --> 02:35:57.840]  was planned just like
[02:35:57.840 --> 02:35:59.480]  California. You go, why is all
[02:35:59.520 --> 02:36:00.960]  this stuff burning down? Remember
[02:36:00.960 --> 02:36:02.040]  made fun of Trump. Trump goes,
[02:36:02.040 --> 02:36:03.360]  you're supposed to rake the
[02:36:03.360 --> 02:36:05.480]  forest. So they call it Europe.
[02:36:06.240 --> 02:36:08.360]  Go to Europe. It's all there's
[02:36:08.360 --> 02:36:09.360]  no kindling. There's nothing on
[02:36:09.360 --> 02:36:10.880]  the ground. It's all taken out
[02:36:10.880 --> 02:36:12.240]  by the foresters in Germany and
[02:36:12.240 --> 02:36:14.440]  France. And then you don't have
[02:36:14.440 --> 02:36:15.600]  those big issues because it's not
[02:36:15.600 --> 02:36:17.880]  there. Why would they leave it
[02:36:18.800 --> 02:36:19.400]  anywhere you go in the
[02:36:19.400 --> 02:36:20.760]  country? You see power lines
[02:36:20.760 --> 02:36:23.640]  with trees all in it? Uh, no.
[02:36:25.880 --> 02:36:27.080]  You see power lines with
[02:36:27.080 --> 02:36:28.120]  bamboo growing up all through
[02:36:28.120 --> 02:36:31.800]  it? No. And black rock that
[02:36:31.800 --> 02:36:33.360]  owns that company, 90% of it
[02:36:34.240 --> 02:36:37.600]  cut the money. Anytime you
[02:36:37.600 --> 02:36:38.800]  drive down the road in the
[02:36:38.800 --> 02:36:40.440]  summer, particularly you see
[02:36:40.440 --> 02:36:41.880]  shredders and big trucks
[02:36:41.880 --> 02:36:45.320]  cutting the trees back. Well,
[02:36:45.320 --> 02:36:47.600]  they better do that or they'll
[02:36:47.600 --> 02:36:50.120]  fall on the power lines. Like
[02:36:50.120 --> 02:36:51.280]  they estimate a third of the
[02:36:51.280 --> 02:36:54.240]  cost of your electricity is not
[02:36:54.240 --> 02:36:55.320]  even the generation of the
[02:36:55.320 --> 02:36:57.280]  power lines. It's the upkeep of
[02:36:57.280 --> 02:36:59.560]  the right of ways. This is
[02:36:59.560 --> 02:37:03.320]  engineering one Oh one turned
[02:37:03.320 --> 02:37:05.200]  off in only two States. I know
[02:37:05.200 --> 02:37:10.120]  of Hawaii and California. This
[02:37:10.120 --> 02:37:11.600]  is the first heroin clip.
[02:37:12.640 --> 02:37:14.160]  LaHanna man talks about them
[02:37:14.160 --> 02:37:16.120]  blocking roads and LaHanna
[02:37:16.160 --> 02:37:17.160]  hindering people on there's
[02:37:17.160 --> 02:37:21.640]  video of it. Here it is. Good
[02:37:21.640 --> 02:37:28.320]  luck. Look at this. This is a
[02:37:28.320 --> 02:37:31.400]  nightmare. I don't know where
[02:37:31.400 --> 02:37:32.640]  he's going probably to block
[02:37:32.640 --> 02:37:34.520]  our street. They're going to
[02:37:34.840 --> 02:37:36.600]  barbecue all these people down
[02:37:36.600 --> 02:37:39.160]  in line. We're all trapped
[02:37:39.160 --> 02:37:40.040]  down in here. They're
[02:37:40.040 --> 02:37:42.840]  blocking off all exits and
[02:37:42.840 --> 02:37:46.120]  everyone is just stuck going in
[02:37:46.120 --> 02:37:50.040]  a circle and a fire pit. Now
[02:37:50.040 --> 02:37:51.320]  that's the few people that
[02:37:51.320 --> 02:37:52.160]  escaped because they were
[02:37:52.160 --> 02:37:54.120]  blocking all the main roads and
[02:37:54.160 --> 02:37:56.440]  front street. Here's fish, a
[02:37:56.440 --> 02:37:58.800]  fixture of LaHanna for decades
[02:37:59.360 --> 02:38:02.800]  runs a little roadside shop
[02:38:02.800 --> 02:38:06.360]  that sells woven hats. And
[02:38:06.360 --> 02:38:07.320]  here's what he said. This is
[02:38:07.320 --> 02:38:09.440]  all confirmed now, but here's
[02:38:09.440 --> 02:38:11.280]  what he said. I think we should
[02:38:11.280 --> 02:38:12.640]  get out of here because of the
[02:38:12.640 --> 02:38:14.200]  speed of this wind. It could be
[02:38:14.200 --> 02:38:16.160]  here in two minutes. And so
[02:38:16.160 --> 02:38:17.080]  about what time was this
[02:38:17.080 --> 02:38:17.840]  effort? By the way, if you
[02:38:17.840 --> 02:38:18.680]  guys don't know who this is,
[02:38:18.680 --> 02:38:19.960]  this is fish. He's been
[02:38:20.000 --> 02:38:21.640]  sitting next to cheeseburger
[02:38:21.640 --> 02:38:23.920]  in paradise, selling the most
[02:38:23.920 --> 02:38:27.480]  awesome stuffs, right? He's
[02:38:27.480 --> 02:38:29.080]  like a legend and everyone
[02:38:29.080 --> 02:38:30.520]  loves fish and fish loves
[02:38:30.520 --> 02:38:31.480]  everybody, but he's one of the
[02:38:31.480 --> 02:38:33.680]  wisest people that I know the
[02:38:33.680 --> 02:38:36.680]  way. Anyway, fish continue. So
[02:38:36.680 --> 02:38:38.240]  I went around back to front
[02:38:38.240 --> 02:38:39.440]  street and there was all the
[02:38:39.440 --> 02:38:41.400]  cars were lined up, but none
[02:38:41.400 --> 02:38:42.920]  of them were moving. And I
[02:38:42.920 --> 02:38:44.040]  walked all the way from
[02:38:44.040 --> 02:38:46.520]  Safeway to Chart House. Not
[02:38:46.520 --> 02:38:48.520]  one car had moved. And I was
[02:38:48.520 --> 02:38:50.280]  wondering what was stopping the
[02:38:50.280 --> 02:38:51.680]  traffic. Well, it was a
[02:38:51.680 --> 02:38:54.040]  policeman and I got to the end
[02:38:54.040 --> 02:38:55.320]  and I looked up North. There
[02:38:55.320 --> 02:38:56.520]  were no obstructions. There
[02:38:56.520 --> 02:38:58.040]  was no reason to keep those
[02:38:58.040 --> 02:39:00.240]  cars. Are you serious? I'm
[02:39:00.240 --> 02:39:02.440]  serious as a heart attack. And
[02:39:02.440 --> 02:39:03.960]  I said, what are you doing?
[02:39:03.960 --> 02:39:04.760]  He goes, well, I'm under
[02:39:04.760 --> 02:39:06.640]  orders to keep them here. And
[02:39:06.640 --> 02:39:08.480]  I said, the fire is right
[02:39:08.480 --> 02:39:10.200]  around Safeway. It's going to
[02:39:10.200 --> 02:39:11.640]  hit front street. You know,
[02:39:11.640 --> 02:39:12.680]  these people got to get out
[02:39:12.680 --> 02:39:14.160]  of here. And he said, I'm
[02:39:14.160 --> 02:39:16.720]  following orders. No way. And
[02:39:16.720 --> 02:39:17.880]  I keep walking down the
[02:39:17.920 --> 02:39:20.280]  highway and I looked behind. No
[02:39:20.280 --> 02:39:22.080]  cars are coming out. I walked
[02:39:22.080 --> 02:39:23.160]  all the way to White Cooley
[02:39:23.160 --> 02:39:24.760]  beach, still no cars coming
[02:39:24.760 --> 02:39:26.200]  out. And I started hearing
[02:39:26.240 --> 02:39:29.000]  boom, boom, boom. And then I
[02:39:29.000 --> 02:39:30.280]  heard people screaming and
[02:39:30.280 --> 02:39:31.240]  stuff. You're saying they
[02:39:31.240 --> 02:39:32.480]  were blockaded in by the
[02:39:32.480 --> 02:39:34.000]  police at the end of front
[02:39:34.000 --> 02:39:36.040]  street? Yeah. Like where that
[02:39:36.040 --> 02:39:37.320]  restaurant is, where the
[02:39:37.320 --> 02:39:38.040]  chart house, where the
[02:39:38.040 --> 02:39:39.000]  chart house was, I should
[02:39:39.000 --> 02:39:40.600]  say, there was a blockade
[02:39:40.600 --> 02:39:41.520]  there and they could not go
[02:39:41.520 --> 02:39:43.960]  anywhere. I walked, I walked
[02:39:43.960 --> 02:39:45.120]  all the way from Safeway to
[02:39:45.120 --> 02:39:46.360]  there. Not one car had
[02:39:46.360 --> 02:39:48.400]  moved all the way to a, like
[02:39:48.400 --> 02:39:50.680]  I said, the city center. And
[02:39:50.680 --> 02:39:51.720]  then I started hearing all
[02:39:51.720 --> 02:39:53.400]  the explosions and there was
[02:39:53.400 --> 02:39:55.040]  no one walking behind me or
[02:39:55.040 --> 02:39:57.400]  on bicycles or anything. I
[02:39:57.400 --> 02:39:59.360]  just, dude, that is
[02:39:59.360 --> 02:40:02.040]  unbelievable. I had no idea,
[02:40:02.160 --> 02:40:03.960]  you know, until the next day
[02:40:03.960 --> 02:40:05.360]  when I walked down there to
[02:40:05.480 --> 02:40:08.280]  what had happened. So did
[02:40:08.280 --> 02:40:09.640]  you, did you go up North to
[02:40:09.640 --> 02:40:11.520]  your place? Yeah. Yeah. And
[02:40:11.520 --> 02:40:12.480]  then you just hunkered down
[02:40:12.480 --> 02:40:13.880]  for the night. Yeah. And
[02:40:13.880 --> 02:40:16.240]  then you show who ordered
[02:40:16.280 --> 02:40:17.520]  the power to stay on, who
[02:40:17.520 --> 02:40:18.440]  ordered the water to not be
[02:40:18.440 --> 02:40:19.880]  transferred. We know the Obama
[02:40:20.240 --> 02:40:22.080]  foundation guy who didn't
[02:40:22.080 --> 02:40:24.680]  trim back the trees, black
[02:40:24.680 --> 02:40:25.760]  rock that I was 9% of the
[02:40:25.760 --> 02:40:27.520]  company and said they in a
[02:40:27.520 --> 02:40:28.400]  press release four and a half
[02:40:28.400 --> 02:40:28.920]  years ago, they weren't
[02:40:28.920 --> 02:40:29.960]  going to update it anymore.
[02:40:30.440 --> 02:40:31.440]  They had all these reports of
[02:40:31.440 --> 02:40:33.480]  power arcs. They have
[02:40:33.480 --> 02:40:35.720]  sensors. They had a maximum
[02:40:35.720 --> 02:40:37.040]  alert, 70, 80 mile an hour
[02:40:37.040 --> 02:40:38.320]  winds will play a newscast
[02:40:38.320 --> 02:40:40.200]  in a moment coming in and
[02:40:40.200 --> 02:40:41.080]  they go, Nope, you don't
[02:40:41.080 --> 02:40:42.640]  get water. And we're
[02:40:42.640 --> 02:40:43.960]  leaving the power on. And
[02:40:43.960 --> 02:40:44.320]  we're going to have the
[02:40:44.320 --> 02:40:45.680]  cops in the one road out
[02:40:45.680 --> 02:40:51.600]  block you in. And again, I've
[02:40:51.600 --> 02:40:52.720]  checked the news. I've checked
[02:40:52.720 --> 02:40:55.360]  it all AP. We covered yesterday
[02:40:55.800 --> 02:40:56.960]  is a nine page article.
[02:40:57.000 --> 02:40:58.040]  Everything I've said is in
[02:40:58.040 --> 02:40:59.920]  there. That's crazy. They're
[02:40:59.920 --> 02:41:01.800]  reporting the truth. I mean,
[02:41:01.800 --> 02:41:03.400]  is there any self preservation
[02:41:03.400 --> 02:41:08.000]  left? Maybe there is. Mallee
[02:41:08.000 --> 02:41:09.400]  utility may have compromised
[02:41:09.400 --> 02:41:11.360]  evidence in fire probe lawyers
[02:41:11.360 --> 02:41:13.760]  say Washington post look at
[02:41:13.760 --> 02:41:16.080]  this hill headline. Mallee
[02:41:16.080 --> 02:41:17.440]  residents who disobeyed
[02:41:17.440 --> 02:41:20.000]  barricades survived fires AP.
[02:41:24.320 --> 02:41:25.440]  Mallee utility may have
[02:41:25.440 --> 02:41:26.840]  compromised evidence in fire
[02:41:26.840 --> 02:41:30.560]  probe lawyers say in deadly
[02:41:30.560 --> 02:41:31.760]  Mallee fires many had no
[02:41:31.760 --> 02:41:33.320]  warning and no layout. Those
[02:41:33.320 --> 02:41:34.440]  who dodged the barricades
[02:41:34.440 --> 02:41:38.560]  survive. We're all trapped.
[02:41:38.560 --> 02:41:39.400]  This is the article you got
[02:41:39.400 --> 02:41:40.720]  to read from yesterday. I'll
[02:41:40.720 --> 02:41:41.440]  have it reposted in
[02:41:41.440 --> 02:41:43.000]  fullworks.com by Don Salazar.
[02:41:44.320 --> 02:41:45.200]  This is one that's dozens of
[02:41:45.200 --> 02:41:46.160]  videos you got to go watch.
[02:41:46.680 --> 02:41:47.920]  They're blocking off all
[02:41:47.920 --> 02:41:50.000]  exits. Driver furious as
[02:41:50.000 --> 02:41:51.800]  police vehicle speeds past him
[02:41:52.080 --> 02:41:53.320]  to trap residents fleeing
[02:41:53.320 --> 02:41:55.000]  Lehane wildfires. By the way,
[02:41:55.000 --> 02:41:57.400]  I saw the video when Jason
[02:41:57.400 --> 02:42:00.480]  Jones was on last week and I
[02:42:00.480 --> 02:42:02.440]  should have aired it. He's like,
[02:42:02.440 --> 02:42:03.200]  Oh, don't air it. It's too
[02:42:03.200 --> 02:42:05.520]  horrible. But it's women in a
[02:42:05.520 --> 02:42:06.880]  car and they're blocked by the
[02:42:06.880 --> 02:42:08.600]  police. And then they were
[02:42:08.600 --> 02:42:09.840]  live streaming. As the fire
[02:42:09.840 --> 02:42:10.840]  gets there, it cuts off. They
[02:42:10.840 --> 02:42:18.040]  all die. So again, here's AP
[02:42:18.040 --> 02:42:19.560]  and deadly Mallee fires. Many
[02:42:19.600 --> 02:42:21.480]  had no warning and no layout.
[02:42:21.600 --> 02:42:22.720]  Those who dodged barricades
[02:42:22.720 --> 02:42:24.240]  survived. And this AP article
[02:42:24.240 --> 02:42:25.800]  describes all how they did it.
[02:42:26.240 --> 02:42:27.280]  Here's the Infowars article
[02:42:27.280 --> 02:42:28.200]  about it. Report Mallee
[02:42:28.200 --> 02:42:29.440]  residents burned to death and
[02:42:29.440 --> 02:42:30.080]  their cars because of
[02:42:30.080 --> 02:42:32.960]  barricades blocking escape. So
[02:42:34.240 --> 02:42:35.680]  you can pull up maps of it,
[02:42:35.680 --> 02:42:38.680]  but here's the ocean. And
[02:42:38.680 --> 02:42:41.960]  here's the main road out. And
[02:42:41.960 --> 02:42:43.800]  then here's the town. And
[02:42:43.800 --> 02:42:45.120]  there's no other main roads
[02:42:45.160 --> 02:42:47.400]  out over here. The road goes
[02:42:47.400 --> 02:42:48.680]  this way, but there's fire all
[02:42:48.680 --> 02:42:51.480]  right here. The police block
[02:42:51.600 --> 02:42:53.080]  the only main road. Some
[02:42:53.080 --> 02:42:54.280]  people drove around, drove
[02:42:54.280 --> 02:42:55.200]  through the woods, drove
[02:42:55.200 --> 02:42:58.360]  through, you know, to get out
[02:42:58.360 --> 02:43:00.280]  and get to the highway. But
[02:43:00.280 --> 02:43:02.480]  the police, so there's fire
[02:43:03.840 --> 02:43:04.720]  from all the power lines
[02:43:04.720 --> 02:43:06.800]  burning is over here and all
[02:43:06.800 --> 02:43:10.560]  over here coming your way. And
[02:43:10.560 --> 02:43:11.640]  you're trying to get out and
[02:43:11.640 --> 02:43:14.480]  you block them. I mean, come on
[02:43:14.480 --> 02:43:18.000]  folks, you're a cops and you
[02:43:18.000 --> 02:43:19.600]  see a wall of fire and
[02:43:19.600 --> 02:43:21.240]  burning vehicles and you won't
[02:43:21.240 --> 02:43:23.040]  let people out. And they
[02:43:23.040 --> 02:43:24.720]  finally, some got out because
[02:43:24.720 --> 02:43:27.200]  the police left. I guess they
[02:43:27.200 --> 02:43:28.600]  finally disregarded orders then
[02:43:30.320 --> 02:43:33.200]  these are crazy people. And
[02:43:33.200 --> 02:43:34.480]  you've got to ask yourself,
[02:43:35.280 --> 02:43:36.240]  who are they taking orders
[02:43:36.240 --> 02:43:39.600]  from? So let's B roll clip
[02:43:39.600 --> 02:43:43.440]  20 and eight for all the
[02:43:43.480 --> 02:43:44.840]  directed energy weapon people.
[02:43:44.880 --> 02:43:45.680]  And I'm not against you
[02:43:45.680 --> 02:43:46.880]  folks, but the directed
[02:43:46.880 --> 02:43:48.440]  energies, not turn the power
[02:43:48.440 --> 02:43:49.520]  lines off and not cut the
[02:43:49.520 --> 02:43:50.760]  trees and not let them have
[02:43:50.760 --> 02:43:52.000]  water. And they now know
[02:43:52.000 --> 02:43:52.960]  that's where the fires came
[02:43:52.960 --> 02:43:54.160]  from was the falling power
[02:43:54.160 --> 02:43:55.760]  poles in that all along the
[02:43:55.760 --> 02:43:58.680]  town as the wind blew in. And
[02:43:58.680 --> 02:44:00.400]  so there's footage of the
[02:44:00.400 --> 02:44:02.600]  power lines falling and
[02:44:02.600 --> 02:44:04.840]  starting the fires. That's it.
[02:44:05.240 --> 02:44:07.080]  That's what did it. That's
[02:44:07.080 --> 02:44:13.920]  what unfolded. Now, let's go
[02:44:13.920 --> 02:44:14.720]  ahead. Now I'm going to clip
[02:44:14.720 --> 02:44:19.880]  six before tragedy in Maui
[02:44:20.360 --> 02:44:21.960]  behind the local Hawaii
[02:44:21.960 --> 02:44:23.800]  weather reporter gives fire
[02:44:23.800 --> 02:44:26.200]  warnings. Here it is down
[02:44:26.200 --> 02:44:27.920]  trees, power outages, the
[02:44:27.920 --> 02:44:29.520]  possibility with this high
[02:44:29.520 --> 02:44:31.000]  pressure fan continuing to
[02:44:31.000 --> 02:44:32.840]  build in. There's a big
[02:44:32.840 --> 02:44:34.040]  pressure difference from that
[02:44:34.040 --> 02:44:35.360]  high pressure fan and also
[02:44:35.360 --> 02:44:37.080]  Dora low pressure system
[02:44:37.080 --> 02:44:38.240]  that you can see to the
[02:44:38.240 --> 02:44:39.480]  south of us with that
[02:44:39.480 --> 02:44:41.480]  hurricane. It's still a major
[02:44:41.480 --> 02:44:43.560]  category four and you see the
[02:44:43.560 --> 02:44:46.000]  winds at the center 1 30. Now
[02:44:46.000 --> 02:44:46.720]  it's going to make its
[02:44:46.720 --> 02:44:47.640]  closest approach to the
[02:44:47.640 --> 02:44:49.080]  island. And then that area
[02:44:49.080 --> 02:44:50.040]  of high pressure, they're
[02:44:50.040 --> 02:44:50.920]  going to both work
[02:44:50.920 --> 02:44:52.640]  together to funnel in very
[02:44:52.640 --> 02:44:53.920]  strong winds across the
[02:44:53.920 --> 02:44:55.480]  entire island chain. And
[02:44:55.480 --> 02:44:56.560]  that's going to last within
[02:44:56.560 --> 02:44:58.560]  the next 36 hours. So a
[02:44:58.560 --> 02:45:00.280]  windy batch coming our way.
[02:45:00.440 --> 02:45:02.240]  In fact, we have a red flag
[02:45:02.240 --> 02:45:03.880]  warning, high wind warnings
[02:45:03.880 --> 02:45:05.280]  are up for all of the islands
[02:45:05.320 --> 02:45:07.560]  dry brush, also low relative
[02:45:07.560 --> 02:45:09.000]  humidity and very gusty
[02:45:09.000 --> 02:45:10.680]  conditions. Gus up to even
[02:45:10.680 --> 02:45:12.160]  50 miles per hour coming our
[02:45:12.160 --> 02:45:13.000]  way tomorrow.
[02:45:14.640 --> 02:45:16.240]  So that's all common sense.
[02:45:16.440 --> 02:45:17.600]  They knew it was happening.
[02:45:19.320 --> 02:45:20.080]  And now they don't want you
[02:45:20.080 --> 02:45:21.480]  to investigate. Here's a clip
[02:45:21.480 --> 02:45:23.480]  nine lane of witnesses on
[02:45:23.480 --> 02:45:25.800]  police deadly traffic blockades.
[02:45:26.080 --> 02:45:27.480]  That's how all those people
[02:45:27.480 --> 02:45:29.880]  died. Here it is. By the
[02:45:29.880 --> 02:45:31.520]  time we got to Safeway
[02:45:34.400 --> 02:45:35.800]  that's what was behind us.
[02:45:35.840 --> 02:45:37.800]  Wow. So you went north. We
[02:45:37.800 --> 02:45:39.080]  went north. Was there down
[02:45:39.080 --> 02:45:40.240]  power lines anywhere on the
[02:45:40.240 --> 02:45:41.200]  highway? Everybody was
[02:45:41.200 --> 02:45:42.280]  stopped. The cops had no
[02:45:42.280 --> 02:45:43.720]  idea that the road was
[02:45:43.720 --> 02:45:44.800]  stopped and they wouldn't let
[02:45:44.800 --> 02:45:46.320]  us move. And I'm looking in
[02:45:46.320 --> 02:45:47.720]  the rear view mirror and the
[02:45:47.720 --> 02:45:48.880]  sky is getting blacker and
[02:45:48.880 --> 02:45:50.160]  blacker in my rear view
[02:45:50.160 --> 02:45:51.960]  mirror. And I'm like, I got
[02:45:51.960 --> 02:45:53.360]  out. We were stopped. I got
[02:45:53.360 --> 02:45:54.360]  out. I beat on his door. He
[02:45:54.360 --> 02:45:55.360]  said, you scared the crap
[02:45:55.360 --> 02:45:56.720]  out of me. I was like, you
[02:45:56.720 --> 02:45:57.760]  see that field? You see that
[02:45:57.760 --> 02:45:59.200]  field? If they don't let us
[02:45:59.200 --> 02:46:00.640]  go, you drive this fucking
[02:46:00.640 --> 02:46:01.440]  van right through that
[02:46:01.440 --> 02:46:02.680]  goddamn field. It used to be
[02:46:02.720 --> 02:46:04.560]  the ocean because fire is
[02:46:04.560 --> 02:46:06.040]  coming right now and we're
[02:46:06.040 --> 02:46:07.280]  not going to make it. That's
[02:46:07.280 --> 02:46:08.640]  all of us because they
[02:46:08.640 --> 02:46:09.960]  wouldn't let nobody go. But
[02:46:09.960 --> 02:46:10.760]  why wouldn't they let them
[02:46:10.760 --> 02:46:11.280]  go? It's because they're
[02:46:11.280 --> 02:46:12.320]  down power lines. Yeah.
[02:46:12.360 --> 02:46:13.920]  That's the reason they
[02:46:13.920 --> 02:46:14.800]  couldn't go. They couldn't
[02:46:14.800 --> 02:46:15.800]  go around the power lines.
[02:46:15.800 --> 02:46:17.120]  The power lines came right
[02:46:17.120 --> 02:46:17.880]  through the guy. They
[02:46:17.880 --> 02:46:18.800]  weren't lit. There was
[02:46:18.800 --> 02:46:20.360]  more power. It was out
[02:46:20.360 --> 02:46:21.760]  from the day before. Right.
[02:46:21.800 --> 02:46:22.720]  Right. So there's no power
[02:46:22.720 --> 02:46:24.720]  in the line because we were
[02:46:24.720 --> 02:46:25.280]  trying to look at the
[02:46:25.280 --> 02:46:26.360]  length of the polls. They
[02:46:26.360 --> 02:46:27.520]  wouldn't cross the whole
[02:46:27.520 --> 02:46:28.240]  highway. There should have
[02:46:28.240 --> 02:46:29.040]  been the lanes. There was
[02:46:29.040 --> 02:46:29.920]  enough room that you could
[02:46:29.920 --> 02:46:31.560]  have gone. Oh, you got
[02:46:31.560 --> 02:46:32.760]  pictures of it to drive
[02:46:32.760 --> 02:46:34.000]  through. So what direction
[02:46:34.000 --> 02:46:34.800]  are we looking at? Like
[02:46:34.800 --> 02:46:35.760]  they stopped the traffic.
[02:46:35.760 --> 02:46:37.200]  So what is that? That's
[02:46:37.200 --> 02:46:38.280]  Kapuna care right there.
[02:46:38.280 --> 02:46:39.160]  That's Kapuna care. And
[02:46:39.160 --> 02:46:40.160]  they, they would not let
[02:46:40.160 --> 02:46:41.160]  people move. So how did
[02:46:41.160 --> 02:46:41.960]  you guys eventually get
[02:46:41.960 --> 02:46:42.640]  your car out of there?
[02:46:43.080 --> 02:46:44.000]  Fighting our way through
[02:46:44.000 --> 02:46:46.000]  the parking lot. A police
[02:46:46.000 --> 02:46:47.200]  officer came off the
[02:46:47.200 --> 02:46:49.360]  bypass here. And so the
[02:46:49.360 --> 02:46:51.480]  traffic was coming down.
[02:46:51.480 --> 02:46:54.400]  We forced our way out of
[02:46:54.400 --> 02:46:55.400]  the park. I wouldn't get
[02:46:55.400 --> 02:46:56.640]  off his bumper. I did not
[02:46:56.640 --> 02:46:57.720]  care about the rules and
[02:46:57.720 --> 02:46:59.000]  the laws of who you're
[02:46:59.000 --> 02:46:59.880]  supposed to stop and let
[02:46:59.880 --> 02:47:00.880]  the next person go. Cause
[02:47:00.880 --> 02:47:02.200]  we got separated before
[02:47:02.760 --> 02:47:03.520]  and I'm not going to get
[02:47:03.520 --> 02:47:05.720]  separate cars. Yeah. I was
[02:47:05.720 --> 02:47:07.840]  in the other van. Were
[02:47:07.840 --> 02:47:08.640]  there any firetrucks
[02:47:08.640 --> 02:47:13.560]  anywhere? All I saw was
[02:47:13.560 --> 02:47:14.560]  the people that were
[02:47:15.520 --> 02:47:16.600]  directing us because of
[02:47:16.600 --> 02:47:17.560]  the power line. There was
[02:47:17.560 --> 02:47:19.360]  police officers that were
[02:47:19.360 --> 02:47:20.400]  telling, telling everybody
[02:47:20.400 --> 02:47:21.800]  go, go. And there was
[02:47:21.800 --> 02:47:22.880]  somebody standing in the
[02:47:22.880 --> 02:47:25.000]  street saying, go, go,
[02:47:25.000 --> 02:47:26.440]  go. One guy was
[02:47:26.440 --> 02:47:29.080]  driving this way. And
[02:47:29.080 --> 02:47:29.760]  when they were coming
[02:47:29.760 --> 02:47:31.360]  down this way, they
[02:47:31.360 --> 02:47:32.120]  were making them turn
[02:47:32.120 --> 02:47:33.240]  around at the civic center
[02:47:33.240 --> 02:47:34.360]  and go back. Cause one
[02:47:34.360 --> 02:47:38.080]  guy was in the street on
[02:47:38.640 --> 02:47:39.560]  almost like the left
[02:47:39.560 --> 02:47:40.480]  hand turn lane, but not
[02:47:40.480 --> 02:47:41.680]  quite. And the power
[02:47:41.680 --> 02:47:43.000]  line came down and was
[02:47:43.000 --> 02:47:44.040]  hooked on his truck. And
[02:47:44.040 --> 02:47:45.400]  he was out of his truck
[02:47:46.160 --> 02:47:47.040]  telling the people that
[02:47:47.040 --> 02:47:48.120]  were trying to come down
[02:47:48.600 --> 02:47:49.920]  to stop. It was just
[02:47:49.920 --> 02:47:51.600]  an individual person and
[02:47:51.600 --> 02:47:52.560]  to let the people that
[02:47:52.560 --> 02:47:53.920]  were coming from the
[02:47:53.920 --> 02:47:56.800]  fire, you know, go that
[02:47:56.800 --> 02:47:57.680]  way. But you then by
[02:47:57.680 --> 02:47:59.520]  then there's like one
[02:47:59.560 --> 02:48:01.280]  and a half lanes to two
[02:48:01.280 --> 02:48:02.800]  lanes to go that way
[02:48:02.800 --> 02:48:03.840]  because the lines that
[02:48:03.840 --> 02:48:06.240]  went down. All right.
[02:48:06.280 --> 02:48:07.080]  Now again, they left
[02:48:07.080 --> 02:48:08.200]  the main power on the
[02:48:08.200 --> 02:48:10.080]  town the day before some
[02:48:10.080 --> 02:48:10.800]  of the power lines, the
[02:48:10.800 --> 02:48:11.920]  highway had fallen. So
[02:48:11.920 --> 02:48:13.720]  that's the insanity. And
[02:48:13.720 --> 02:48:14.960]  then no water's given.
[02:48:15.760 --> 02:48:17.200]  And up until the fire
[02:48:17.240 --> 02:48:18.720]  hit the town, they're
[02:48:18.720 --> 02:48:19.760]  on record. Washington
[02:48:19.760 --> 02:48:20.440]  post talked to him.
[02:48:20.440 --> 02:48:21.320]  They said, yeah, we
[02:48:21.320 --> 02:48:22.000]  didn't give you water
[02:48:22.560 --> 02:48:23.520]  until the fire hit the
[02:48:23.520 --> 02:48:25.040]  town. Now look at
[02:48:25.040 --> 02:48:28.480]  this. This is out of
[02:48:28.480 --> 02:48:29.880]  King five. This is a
[02:48:32.600 --> 02:48:34.280]  mainstream news, very
[02:48:34.280 --> 02:48:36.120]  dangerous police and FBI
[02:48:36.120 --> 02:48:37.320]  investigate power poles
[02:48:37.320 --> 02:48:38.840]  cut with chainsaw. This
[02:48:38.840 --> 02:48:42.520]  is happening all over the
[02:48:42.520 --> 02:48:44.480]  Pacific Northwest. And
[02:48:44.480 --> 02:48:45.640]  in Hawaii, they're
[02:48:45.640 --> 02:48:47.480]  finding the power poles
[02:48:48.120 --> 02:48:50.280]  hacked into so they
[02:48:50.280 --> 02:48:51.240]  don't fall right over,
[02:48:51.240 --> 02:48:52.480]  but a high wind snaps
[02:48:52.480 --> 02:48:53.440]  them. And they've
[02:48:53.440 --> 02:48:54.720]  caught antifa setting
[02:48:54.720 --> 02:48:56.040]  fires everywhere. They've
[02:48:56.040 --> 02:48:57.600]  caught antifa derailing
[02:48:57.600 --> 02:48:58.400]  trains. So this has been
[02:48:58.400 --> 02:49:01.320]  reported in areas of
[02:49:01.600 --> 02:49:05.480]  Maui as well. So this
[02:49:05.480 --> 02:49:07.440]  is a big, big deal. And
[02:49:07.440 --> 02:49:09.000]  you heard some of the
[02:49:09.000 --> 02:49:09.680]  police were blocking
[02:49:09.680 --> 02:49:10.720]  people in the town. Other
[02:49:10.720 --> 02:49:11.760]  police were out saying,
[02:49:11.760 --> 02:49:13.720]  get out. So not all
[02:49:13.720 --> 02:49:14.560]  the police follow the
[02:49:14.560 --> 02:49:16.080]  orders. That's why there
[02:49:16.080 --> 02:49:17.400]  there's a coverup because
[02:49:17.400 --> 02:49:18.440]  they don't want people
[02:49:18.440 --> 02:49:19.880]  to know who gave the
[02:49:19.880 --> 02:49:21.120]  order to block the people
[02:49:21.120 --> 02:49:22.600]  in the town. Same guy
[02:49:22.600 --> 02:49:24.040]  that ran the Las Vegas
[02:49:24.240 --> 02:49:26.280]  coverup. And we all
[02:49:26.400 --> 02:49:27.840]  Vegas was a coverup.
[02:49:27.840 --> 02:49:28.280]  We're not supposed to
[02:49:28.280 --> 02:49:29.360]  question mass shootings,
[02:49:29.360 --> 02:49:30.440]  but they never even told
[02:49:30.440 --> 02:49:31.560]  us who did it. This is
[02:49:31.560 --> 02:49:33.040]  the guy that did that.
[02:49:33.040 --> 02:49:34.240]  So bare minimum, they
[02:49:34.240 --> 02:49:35.040]  didn't trim the trees
[02:49:35.040 --> 02:49:35.760]  bare minimum. They left
[02:49:35.760 --> 02:49:36.440]  the power on those
[02:49:36.440 --> 02:49:38.000]  areas and bare minimum.
[02:49:38.240 --> 02:49:39.160]  That's what happened
[02:49:39.160 --> 02:49:40.600]  there. There's a bunch
[02:49:40.600 --> 02:49:41.680]  of other clips we
[02:49:41.680 --> 02:49:44.880]  haven't gotten to. Let's
[02:49:44.880 --> 02:49:46.880]  go ahead and go to
[02:49:46.880 --> 02:49:47.920]  clip seven. Here's clip
[02:49:47.920 --> 02:49:49.840]  seven. They said
[02:49:49.840 --> 02:49:50.800]  everybody's off, get off
[02:49:50.800 --> 02:49:51.760]  this highway, go down
[02:49:51.760 --> 02:49:53.120]  this way down into town.
[02:49:53.440 --> 02:49:53.960]  Then they started
[02:49:53.960 --> 02:49:54.760]  blocking everything off
[02:49:54.760 --> 02:49:55.640]  there. And you got
[02:49:55.640 --> 02:49:56.880]  corralled onto Front
[02:49:56.880 --> 02:49:57.960]  Street. You started on
[02:49:57.960 --> 02:49:58.560]  the Juana Pilani
[02:49:58.560 --> 02:49:59.680]  highway. Yes. And you
[02:49:59.680 --> 02:50:00.440]  ended up on Front
[02:50:00.440 --> 02:50:01.120]  Street. Couldn't go
[02:50:01.120 --> 02:50:01.800]  anywhere. They just
[02:50:01.800 --> 02:50:02.640]  said, go North, go
[02:50:02.640 --> 02:50:03.880]  North, go North. And
[02:50:03.880 --> 02:50:04.600]  then when we got on
[02:50:04.600 --> 02:50:05.560]  Front Street, embers
[02:50:05.560 --> 02:50:06.080]  were coming over the
[02:50:06.080 --> 02:50:07.360]  buildings and landing on
[02:50:07.360 --> 02:50:09.080]  our vehicles. And we're
[02:50:09.080 --> 02:50:09.960]  all in a line, trying
[02:50:09.960 --> 02:50:10.560]  to get to the end of
[02:50:10.560 --> 02:50:11.200]  Front Street to go
[02:50:11.200 --> 02:50:12.040]  North. Like they told
[02:50:12.040 --> 02:50:13.480]  us to not knowing that
[02:50:13.480 --> 02:50:14.640]  the police blocked off
[02:50:14.640 --> 02:50:15.400]  the end of Front
[02:50:15.400 --> 02:50:16.360]  Street. So nobody could
[02:50:16.360 --> 02:50:17.040]  move. All of a sudden
[02:50:17.040 --> 02:50:17.640]  nobody could move
[02:50:17.640 --> 02:50:19.040]  anywhere. So all I did
[02:50:19.040 --> 02:50:19.760]  was try to inch my
[02:50:19.760 --> 02:50:20.920]  way over to another
[02:50:20.920 --> 02:50:22.080]  yard and drive up
[02:50:22.080 --> 02:50:24.240]  through a sidewalk, come
[02:50:24.280 --> 02:50:25.600]  back around. And then I
[02:50:25.640 --> 02:50:27.200]  went, the cops were
[02:50:27.200 --> 02:50:28.800]  moving around one exit.
[02:50:28.880 --> 02:50:30.280]  So I ended up getting
[02:50:30.280 --> 02:50:31.000]  up on the highway,
[02:50:31.000 --> 02:50:31.520]  even though they
[02:50:31.560 --> 02:50:32.200]  trying to direct me
[02:50:32.200 --> 02:50:33.160]  another way. And then
[02:50:33.160 --> 02:50:34.120]  I hightailed it to
[02:50:34.120 --> 02:50:34.760]  home. So you
[02:50:34.760 --> 02:50:35.600]  basically had to climb
[02:50:35.600 --> 02:50:37.280]  up on sidewalks and go
[02:50:37.280 --> 02:50:38.160]  against what the
[02:50:38.160 --> 02:50:38.960]  cops were telling you
[02:50:38.960 --> 02:50:40.040]  you could do you to
[02:50:40.040 --> 02:50:41.000]  break traffic laws,
[02:50:41.000 --> 02:50:42.200]  essentially. Basically,
[02:50:42.240 --> 02:50:43.840]  I was in my truck
[02:50:44.000 --> 02:50:45.000]  going to check on
[02:50:45.000 --> 02:50:46.280]  some customers
[02:50:46.280 --> 02:50:47.720]  properties. And all of
[02:50:47.720 --> 02:50:48.440]  a sudden all the
[02:50:48.440 --> 02:50:49.240]  roads were being
[02:50:49.240 --> 02:50:50.160]  blocked off right in
[02:50:50.160 --> 02:50:51.000]  front of me and I
[02:50:51.360 --> 02:50:52.960]  from the cops, and I
[02:50:52.960 --> 02:50:53.600]  would go to the next
[02:50:53.600 --> 02:50:54.280]  street and that would
[02:50:54.280 --> 02:50:55.120]  be blocked up and the
[02:50:55.120 --> 02:50:55.960]  next one and they just
[02:50:55.960 --> 02:50:56.880]  blocked everything
[02:50:56.880 --> 02:50:58.640]  off, forced everybody
[02:50:58.640 --> 02:51:01.120]  down on front street in
[02:51:01.120 --> 02:51:02.400]  which then the flames
[02:51:02.400 --> 02:51:03.480]  were coming over our
[02:51:03.480 --> 02:51:04.960]  vehicles, not on our
[02:51:04.960 --> 02:51:05.880]  vehicles, but the
[02:51:05.880 --> 02:51:06.640]  flames are coming over
[02:51:06.640 --> 02:51:07.600]  top of our vehicles.
[02:51:07.600 --> 02:51:08.240]  What street do you
[02:51:08.240 --> 02:51:08.920]  want at this point in
[02:51:08.920 --> 02:51:09.920]  time? Front Street.
[02:51:09.960 --> 02:51:10.800]  You're on front street
[02:51:10.800 --> 02:51:11.880]  itself. Yeah. So you
[02:51:11.880 --> 02:51:13.040]  got directed onto front
[02:51:13.040 --> 02:51:13.880]  street. Where did you
[02:51:13.880 --> 02:51:15.120]  start when you started
[02:51:15.120 --> 02:51:16.360]  this journey? I was
[02:51:16.360 --> 02:51:17.680]  going down the highway
[02:51:17.680 --> 02:51:18.640]  and they blocked it off
[02:51:18.640 --> 02:51:19.200]  and wouldn't let me
[02:51:19.200 --> 02:51:20.120]  go any further. So you
[02:51:20.120 --> 02:51:20.840]  were coming from
[02:51:20.840 --> 02:51:22.080]  Laniapoko? No, I was
[02:51:22.080 --> 02:51:23.640]  coming from Waikuli.
[02:51:23.880 --> 02:51:24.640]  Why? Okay, so you're
[02:51:24.640 --> 02:51:25.520]  heading down the
[02:51:25.520 --> 02:51:26.640]  highway south and then
[02:51:26.640 --> 02:51:27.640]  they stopped, they
[02:51:27.640 --> 02:51:28.520]  stopped us from going
[02:51:28.520 --> 02:51:30.560]  up on the bypass. Then
[02:51:30.560 --> 02:51:31.240]  they wouldn't let me go
[02:51:31.240 --> 02:51:32.800]  past the bypass to the
[02:51:32.800 --> 02:51:34.000]  other exits to go up
[02:51:34.000 --> 02:51:35.600]  there. Then you
[02:51:35.600 --> 02:51:36.120]  couldn't go up the
[02:51:36.120 --> 02:51:37.640]  bypass? No. And then
[02:51:37.680 --> 02:51:38.320]  then all of a sudden
[02:51:38.320 --> 02:51:38.920]  they said, everybody's
[02:51:38.920 --> 02:51:39.720]  off, get off this
[02:51:39.720 --> 02:51:40.680]  highway, go down this
[02:51:40.680 --> 02:51:41.880]  way down into town.
[02:51:42.160 --> 02:51:42.720]  Then they started
[02:51:42.720 --> 02:51:43.480]  blocking everything off
[02:51:43.480 --> 02:51:44.400]  there. And then you
[02:51:44.400 --> 02:51:45.120]  were down on front
[02:51:45.120 --> 02:51:47.080]  street. And I got all
[02:51:47.080 --> 02:51:47.840]  the way down to
[02:51:47.840 --> 02:51:49.480]  Safeway. And you got
[02:51:49.480 --> 02:51:50.720]  corralled onto front
[02:51:50.720 --> 02:51:51.800]  street. You started on
[02:51:51.840 --> 02:51:52.400]  the Hona-Pilani
[02:51:52.400 --> 02:51:53.560]  highway. Yes. And you
[02:51:53.560 --> 02:51:54.280]  ended up on front
[02:51:54.280 --> 02:51:55.000]  street. Yes. Couldn't go
[02:51:55.000 --> 02:51:55.680]  anywhere. They just
[02:51:55.680 --> 02:51:56.480]  said, go north, go
[02:51:56.480 --> 02:51:57.720]  north, go north. And
[02:51:57.720 --> 02:51:58.440]  then when we got on
[02:51:58.440 --> 02:51:59.400]  front street, embers
[02:51:59.400 --> 02:51:59.960]  were coming over the
[02:51:59.960 --> 02:52:01.240]  buildings and landing on
[02:52:01.240 --> 02:52:02.960]  our vehicles. And we're
[02:52:02.960 --> 02:52:03.880]  all in a line trying to
[02:52:03.880 --> 02:52:04.600]  get to the end of front
[02:52:04.600 --> 02:52:05.560]  street to go north, like
[02:52:05.560 --> 02:52:06.800]  they told us to, not
[02:52:06.800 --> 02:52:07.440]  knowing that the
[02:52:07.440 --> 02:52:08.680]  police blocked off the
[02:52:08.680 --> 02:52:09.800]  end of front street so
[02:52:09.800 --> 02:52:10.960]  nobody could move. And
[02:52:10.960 --> 02:52:11.680]  then everybody
[02:52:11.680 --> 02:52:13.080]  panicked and they all
[02:52:13.080 --> 02:52:14.680]  started, everybody went
[02:52:14.680 --> 02:52:15.800]  up on the sidewalks and
[02:52:15.800 --> 02:52:17.000]  through yards, took
[02:52:17.000 --> 02:52:17.960]  out the other lane,
[02:52:17.960 --> 02:52:18.720]  nobody. And then all
[02:52:18.720 --> 02:52:19.320]  of a sudden nobody
[02:52:19.320 --> 02:52:20.480]  could move anywhere. So
[02:52:20.480 --> 02:52:21.400]  all I did was try to
[02:52:21.400 --> 02:52:22.600]  change my way over to
[02:52:22.640 --> 02:52:23.960]  another yard and drive
[02:52:23.960 --> 02:52:25.920]  up through a sidewalk,
[02:52:26.000 --> 02:52:27.240]  come back around. And
[02:52:27.240 --> 02:52:29.000]  then I went, the cops
[02:52:29.040 --> 02:52:30.360]  were moving around one
[02:52:30.360 --> 02:52:31.680]  exit. So I ended up
[02:52:31.960 --> 02:52:32.600]  getting up on the
[02:52:32.600 --> 02:52:33.320]  highway, even though
[02:52:33.320 --> 02:52:34.200]  they try to direct me
[02:52:34.200 --> 02:52:35.120]  another way. And then
[02:52:35.120 --> 02:52:36.120]  I hightailed it to
[02:52:36.120 --> 02:52:37.120]  home. So you basically
[02:52:37.120 --> 02:52:37.920]  had to climb up on
[02:52:37.920 --> 02:52:39.280]  sidewalks and go
[02:52:39.280 --> 02:52:40.480]  against what the cops
[02:52:40.480 --> 02:52:41.080]  were telling you you
[02:52:41.080 --> 02:52:42.000]  could do. You had to
[02:52:42.000 --> 02:52:43.000]  break traffic laws,
[02:52:43.000 --> 02:52:44.120]  essentially. Basically.
[02:52:44.120 --> 02:52:45.600]  Yeah. Let's stop
[02:52:45.600 --> 02:52:47.600]  right there. I don't
[02:52:47.600 --> 02:52:48.520]  mind the police here.
[02:52:49.360 --> 02:52:50.960]  Overall, they
[02:52:50.960 --> 02:52:52.720]  followed orders and
[02:52:52.720 --> 02:52:53.160]  didn't know what's
[02:52:53.160 --> 02:52:53.920]  going on, but the
[02:52:53.920 --> 02:52:54.880]  emergency manager for
[02:52:54.880 --> 02:52:56.480]  the state, the counties
[02:52:56.480 --> 02:52:57.520]  and the city were all
[02:52:57.520 --> 02:52:59.360]  at a meeting about the
[02:52:59.360 --> 02:53:01.720]  future of that area on
[02:53:01.720 --> 02:53:02.600]  another island, on
[02:53:02.600 --> 02:53:05.520]  this Oahu, like FEMA's
[02:53:05.520 --> 02:53:06.280]  and thousand dollar
[02:53:06.560 --> 02:53:07.360]  hotels right now,
[02:53:07.360 --> 02:53:08.800]  they're in Maui and
[02:53:08.800 --> 02:53:09.560]  they're busy covering
[02:53:09.560 --> 02:53:12.600]  this up. And the
[02:53:12.600 --> 02:53:13.640]  bottom line is
[02:53:13.720 --> 02:53:14.800]  environmental rules,
[02:53:14.800 --> 02:53:15.680]  not to cut the trees
[02:53:15.680 --> 02:53:17.240]  back, not to update
[02:53:17.240 --> 02:53:18.480]  things, leaving the
[02:53:18.480 --> 02:53:20.280]  power on led to all of
[02:53:20.280 --> 02:53:20.960]  this. And it's a
[02:53:20.960 --> 02:53:22.520]  microcosm of how
[02:53:22.520 --> 02:53:23.360]  they're killing us. And
[02:53:23.360 --> 02:53:24.040]  it's got people's
[02:53:24.040 --> 02:53:25.600]  attention. That's what's
[02:53:25.600 --> 02:53:27.160]  important. Now here's a
[02:53:27.160 --> 02:53:30.120]  clip of men in a car,
[02:53:30.120 --> 02:53:31.400]  seeing a woman get
[02:53:31.400 --> 02:53:32.400]  basically dying on the
[02:53:32.400 --> 02:53:33.880]  street and not rendering
[02:53:33.880 --> 02:53:34.880]  aid. Just to give me
[02:53:34.880 --> 02:53:35.400]  an idea of what's
[02:53:35.400 --> 02:53:37.200]  going on. We're almost
[02:53:37.200 --> 02:53:37.680]  to the end of the
[02:53:37.680 --> 02:53:38.840]  mail. We're almost to
[02:53:38.840 --> 02:53:39.400]  the smoke staff.
[02:53:42.640 --> 02:53:43.200]  Oh, we made it.
[02:53:43.200 --> 02:53:44.160]  We're going to line
[02:53:44.160 --> 02:53:44.880]  on the road now for
[02:53:44.880 --> 02:53:47.480]  you. Somebody's down
[02:53:47.480 --> 02:53:48.840]  right now. Somebody's
[02:53:48.840 --> 02:53:49.960]  down. Somebody's down.
[02:53:50.960 --> 02:53:51.480]  Let's go down. We
[02:53:51.480 --> 02:53:52.280]  cannot do nothing for
[02:53:52.280 --> 02:53:54.600]  her. Oh my God. Just
[02:53:54.600 --> 02:53:55.720]  go home. We cannot do
[02:53:55.720 --> 02:53:57.600]  nothing for her. Just
[02:53:57.600 --> 02:53:58.840]  go. Go people. Go
[02:53:58.840 --> 02:53:59.280]  beat the word.
[02:54:08.200 --> 02:54:08.760]  And we have the
[02:54:08.760 --> 02:54:09.440]  footage of the young
[02:54:09.440 --> 02:54:10.600]  woman burning. Do we
[02:54:10.600 --> 02:54:12.560]  should play that? I
[02:54:12.560 --> 02:54:13.080]  don't think I want to
[02:54:13.080 --> 02:54:16.560]  play it. So this is a
[02:54:16.560 --> 02:54:17.800]  microcosm of an
[02:54:17.800 --> 02:54:18.480]  aptitude running
[02:54:18.480 --> 02:54:19.160]  government or
[02:54:19.160 --> 02:54:19.920]  government against
[02:54:19.920 --> 02:54:21.160]  you. And they won't
[02:54:21.160 --> 02:54:22.000]  cut the brush back in
[02:54:22.000 --> 02:54:23.360]  California and they
[02:54:23.360 --> 02:54:26.560]  won't do it in Hawaii
[02:54:26.560 --> 02:54:29.760]  now. And so they're
[02:54:29.760 --> 02:54:32.360]  allowing this threat to
[02:54:32.360 --> 02:54:38.760]  grow and grow and grow.
[02:54:40.440 --> 02:54:42.440]  But it's sexy to
[02:54:42.440 --> 02:54:43.440]  say it was space
[02:54:43.440 --> 02:54:46.720]  lasers. And I'm not
[02:54:46.720 --> 02:54:47.520]  saying direct energy
[02:54:47.520 --> 02:54:49.480]  weapons don't exist. And
[02:54:49.480 --> 02:54:50.080]  I'm not saying that
[02:54:50.080 --> 02:54:50.720]  couldn't have been it,
[02:54:50.720 --> 02:54:52.320]  but it's the power
[02:54:52.320 --> 02:54:53.600]  lines and it's the
[02:54:53.600 --> 02:54:55.080]  high wind and it's not
[02:54:55.080 --> 02:54:56.320]  trimming them back. And
[02:54:56.320 --> 02:54:57.040]  it's them denying
[02:54:57.040 --> 02:54:58.200]  water. And then it's
[02:54:58.200 --> 02:55:00.280]  directing everyone to
[02:55:00.280 --> 02:55:02.480]  go into the flames and
[02:55:02.480 --> 02:55:03.520]  then blocking them on
[02:55:03.520 --> 02:55:04.880]  the main one dead end
[02:55:04.880 --> 02:55:06.400]  street. How is police?
[02:55:06.400 --> 02:55:07.480]  Do you look at a map
[02:55:07.960 --> 02:55:09.160]  and then direct people
[02:55:09.160 --> 02:55:12.040]  off the highway into a
[02:55:12.040 --> 02:55:15.640]  town and then sit there
[02:55:15.640 --> 02:55:18.280]  while they back up and
[02:55:18.280 --> 02:55:19.600]  then only panic and
[02:55:19.600 --> 02:55:20.920]  leave when the flames
[02:55:20.920 --> 02:55:27.800]  reach you? Is it perfect
[02:55:27.800 --> 02:55:30.120]  ineptitude? Is it
[02:55:30.120 --> 02:55:32.640]  perfect idiocy? Because
[02:55:32.640 --> 02:55:33.240]  we are living in
[02:55:33.240 --> 02:55:36.600]  idiocracy. Or is it
[02:55:36.600 --> 02:55:38.120]  deliberate? Regardless,
[02:55:38.120 --> 02:55:38.840]  there's a 12 mile
[02:55:38.880 --> 02:55:39.680]  exclusion zone,
[02:55:40.320 --> 02:55:41.320]  regardless of covering
[02:55:41.320 --> 02:55:42.000]  it up. I want to end
[02:55:42.000 --> 02:55:43.720]  the shower with Texas
[02:55:43.720 --> 02:55:45.160]  school board has cops
[02:55:45.160 --> 02:55:46.000]  fortunately removed
[02:55:46.000 --> 02:55:47.280]  father reading
[02:55:47.280 --> 02:55:48.280]  pornographic book
[02:55:48.280 --> 02:55:48.920]  found in school
[02:55:48.920 --> 02:55:50.160]  libraries. I've got
[02:55:50.160 --> 02:55:51.000]  shots of the book. I'm
[02:55:51.000 --> 02:55:51.480]  not going to show
[02:55:51.480 --> 02:55:52.360]  these on air. It's
[02:55:52.360 --> 02:55:55.120]  child porn. But it's
[02:55:55.120 --> 02:55:56.920]  children having sex
[02:55:56.920 --> 02:55:58.880]  with adults and the
[02:55:58.880 --> 02:56:00.200]  father tries to read
[02:56:00.200 --> 02:56:03.720]  it and he gets removed
[02:56:03.720 --> 02:56:04.240]  and arrested
[02:56:04.240 --> 02:56:06.080]  reportedly because you
[02:56:06.080 --> 02:56:07.800]  can't tell adults about
[02:56:07.800 --> 02:56:08.480]  what children are
[02:56:08.480 --> 02:56:10.640]  shown. A system
[02:56:10.640 --> 02:56:11.680]  protecting the evil.
[02:56:11.800 --> 02:56:12.400]  Here's a clip.
[02:56:16.880 --> 02:56:18.760]  Mr. C, please continue,
[02:56:18.760 --> 02:56:23.360]  sir. Okay. Who wants
[02:56:23.360 --> 02:56:25.120]  my hot wiener? Oh,
[02:56:25.120 --> 02:56:30.200]  yeah. It's a hot
[02:56:30.200 --> 02:56:39.920]  phone page two. Don't
[02:56:39.920 --> 02:56:41.120]  touch him. He didn't
[02:56:41.120 --> 02:56:55.560]  break the law. Easy
[02:56:55.560 --> 02:56:58.120]  now. Easy. Parents
[02:56:58.120 --> 02:56:58.520]  see what we're
[02:56:58.520 --> 02:56:59.840]  teaching the kids. Take
[02:56:59.840 --> 02:57:01.080]  your time. Got to keep
[02:57:01.080 --> 02:57:04.240]  it secret. Always
[02:57:04.240 --> 02:57:05.000]  heading into bedding
[02:57:05.000 --> 02:57:14.920]  evil. You will not show
[02:57:14.920 --> 02:57:15.920]  them what the middle
[02:57:15.920 --> 02:57:18.080]  schoolers are shown in
[02:57:18.080 --> 02:57:22.600]  the school and they
[02:57:22.600 --> 02:57:23.600]  have the footage of
[02:57:23.600 --> 02:57:24.320]  him reading from the
[02:57:24.320 --> 02:57:25.040]  book that started at
[02:57:25.040 --> 02:57:27.440]  all. You need to fix
[02:57:27.440 --> 02:57:28.880]  this. Stop pushing me.
[02:57:29.120 --> 02:57:31.240]  You've been asked. You
[02:57:31.240 --> 02:57:33.640]  are not gonna read the
[02:57:33.640 --> 02:57:35.080]  books we show the
[02:57:35.080 --> 02:57:38.480]  middle schoolers. No, see
[02:57:38.480 --> 02:57:39.040]  we're not banning
[02:57:39.040 --> 02:57:39.720]  books. We're trying to
[02:57:39.720 --> 02:57:40.440]  keep pedophilia away
[02:57:40.440 --> 02:57:42.000]  from children. We're
[02:57:42.000 --> 02:57:47.400]  right back. I've
[02:57:47.400 --> 02:57:48.800]  studied how the
[02:57:48.800 --> 02:57:50.160]  globalist, how the mad
[02:57:50.160 --> 02:57:50.840]  scientists are
[02:57:50.840 --> 02:57:52.320]  controlling us and
[02:57:52.320 --> 02:57:53.520]  they're doing it by
[02:57:53.520 --> 02:57:54.840]  keeping us undernourished.
[02:57:55.240 --> 02:57:56.040]  You can eat all the
[02:57:56.040 --> 02:57:56.680]  food you want in the
[02:57:56.680 --> 02:57:57.680]  world, but if you don't
[02:57:57.680 --> 02:57:59.280]  have the essential
[02:57:59.280 --> 02:58:00.320]  vitamins and minerals
[02:58:00.600 --> 02:58:01.320]  in an organic
[02:58:01.320 --> 02:58:02.640]  absorbable form, if you
[02:58:02.640 --> 02:58:03.200]  don't have the key
[02:58:03.200 --> 02:58:04.280]  elements like iodine,
[02:58:04.720 --> 02:58:05.880]  you are literally like
[02:58:05.880 --> 02:58:06.920]  someone in a paddle
[02:58:06.920 --> 02:58:08.320]  boat without ores,
[02:58:08.880 --> 02:58:10.640]  without paddles. Ladies
[02:58:10.640 --> 02:58:11.880]  and gentlemen, we are

[03:00:20.400 --> 03:00:21.360]  thousands of churches
[03:00:21.360 --> 03:00:22.160]  have been burned in
[03:00:22.160 --> 03:00:25.640]  Europe. We have all
[03:00:25.640 --> 03:00:26.560]  these other headlines

[03:00:32.120 --> 03:00:34.080]  binary teacher. Where
[03:00:34.080 --> 03:00:34.760]  are these people
[03:00:34.760 --> 03:00:37.760]  coming from? Why are
[03:00:37.760 --> 03:00:43.720]  they doing this? A
[03:00:43.720 --> 03:00:44.560]  teacher in Illinois
[03:00:44.560 --> 03:00:45.280]  elementary school is

[03:00:48.440 --> 03:00:49.280]  picked up on it out.
[03:00:49.520 --> 03:00:51.000]  The non binary person
[03:00:51.320 --> 03:00:52.160]  was also a Satan
[03:00:52.160 --> 03:00:52.920]  worshiper and had a

[03:00:57.320 --> 03:00:59.440]  shot please look who
[03:00:59.440 --> 03:01:00.480]  wants to get a teaching
[03:01:00.520 --> 03:01:02.040]  certificate and teach
[03:01:02.040 --> 03:01:05.040]  your children. This is
[03:01:05.040 --> 03:01:05.960]  what we're up against.
[03:01:06.920 --> 03:01:08.440]  They're everywhere. This
[03:01:08.440 --> 03:01:10.800]  is the satanic move on
[03:01:10.800 --> 03:01:12.080]  civilization. Here's
[03:01:12.080 --> 03:01:13.080]  another video I will
[03:01:13.080 --> 03:01:14.760]  rape Jesus illegal

[03:01:20.880 --> 03:01:26.120]  windows with rocks. And
[03:01:26.120 --> 03:01:28.960]  it goes on and on and
[03:01:28.960 --> 03:01:32.040]  on and on. All right, I
[03:01:32.040 --> 03:01:33.040]  didn't get fully into
[03:01:33.040 --> 03:01:34.240]  14 American cities to
[03:01:34.240 --> 03:01:36.120]  ban meat, dairy, and
[03:01:36.120 --> 03:01:37.760]  private vehicles or

[03:01:58.120 --> 03:01:59.040]  lunatics access to

[03:02:03.600 --> 03:02:05.000]  they have to get you to
[03:02:05.000 --> 03:02:05.920]  be overwhelmed all the
[03:02:05.920 --> 03:02:07.880]  craziness to accept the

[03:04:57.480 --> 03:04:58.440]  The globalist aren't
[03:04:58.440 --> 03:04:59.240]  just targeting us
[03:04:59.240 --> 03:04:59.920]  through the poison
[03:04:59.920 --> 03:05:01.040]  shots or the
[03:05:01.040 --> 03:05:02.680]  electromagnetic 5g or
[03:05:02.680 --> 03:05:04.080]  the GMO crops. They're
[03:05:04.080 --> 03:05:04.720]  hitting us with
[03:05:04.720 --> 03:05:05.880]  hundreds of chemicals
[03:05:06.080 --> 03:05:07.560]  that the EPA has
[03:05:07.560 --> 03:05:08.920]  authorized companies and
[03:05:08.920 --> 03:05:10.440]  industry to use. One
[03:05:10.440 --> 03:05:11.960]  of the top pesticides
[03:05:11.960 --> 03:05:13.800]  used is atrazine. The
[03:05:13.800 --> 03:05:15.000]  allowable level the
[03:05:15.000 --> 03:05:15.920]  government admits that
[03:05:15.920 --> 03:05:16.760]  they allow to be in
[03:05:16.760 --> 03:05:17.640]  your water supply is
[03:05:17.640 --> 03:05:18.800]  enough to sterilize you
[03:05:18.960 --> 03:05:20.360]  and basically turn your
[03:05:20.400 --> 03:05:21.960]  son into a feminized
[03:05:21.960 --> 03:05:23.400]  mutant. Look it up.
[03:05:23.880 --> 03:05:24.760]  Don't let them do this
[03:05:24.760 --> 03:05:25.440]  to your family. We
[03:05:25.440 --> 03:05:26.200]  have the very best
[03:05:26.200 --> 03:05:27.400]  gravity fed filter
[03:05:27.400 --> 03:05:28.320]  system out there.
[03:05:28.400 --> 03:05:29.960]  Highest rated at half
[03:05:29.960 --> 03:05:30.960]  the price of leading
[03:05:30.960 --> 03:05:32.080]  competitors. The Alexa
[03:05:32.080 --> 03:05:33.240]  Pure ready to ship
[03:05:33.240 --> 03:05:34.080]  to you right now. We
[03:05:34.080 --> 03:05:34.640]  have replacement
[03:05:34.640 --> 03:05:35.480]  filters for folks
[03:05:35.480 --> 03:05:36.040]  who've already gotten
[03:05:36.040 --> 03:05:37.000]  it. It does 10,000
[03:05:37.000 --> 03:05:37.480]  gallons for you
[03:05:37.480 --> 03:05:38.400]  replace them. It is
[03:05:38.400 --> 03:05:39.560]  amazing. It's great
[03:05:39.560 --> 03:05:40.520]  for your home, your

[03:05:41.120 --> 03:05:42.480]  swamp water in it, tap
[03:05:42.480 --> 03:05:43.640]  water, whatever, well
[03:05:43.640 --> 03:05:44.360]  water, almost
[03:05:44.360 --> 03:05:44.640]  everything's
[03:05:44.640 --> 03:05:45.720]  contaminated. This is
[03:05:45.720 --> 03:05:46.640]  how you take control
[03:05:46.800 --> 03:05:47.520]  of the fluids in your
[03:05:47.520 --> 03:05:48.440]  body and counter the
[03:05:48.440 --> 03:05:49.280]  globalists onslaught.

[03:05:53.840 --> 03:05:54.880]  huge discount. Sorry,
[03:05:54.880 --> 03:05:55.600]  the lowest price out
[03:05:55.600 --> 03:05:56.320]  there. You need this
[03:05:56.320 --> 03:05:56.680]  filter.
[03:05:58.280 --> 03:05:59.200]  eternity. We've been
[03:05:59.200 --> 03:06:00.520]  screaming the truth to
[03:06:00.520 --> 03:06:01.880]  the world. And it's
[03:06:01.960 --> 03:06:03.560]  remarkable that we get
[03:06:03.560 --> 03:06:05.080]  proved right time and
[03:06:05.080 --> 03:06:06.440]  time again. And when
[03:06:06.440 --> 03:06:07.480]  we say something new is
[03:06:07.480 --> 03:06:08.280]  coming, people still
[03:06:08.280 --> 03:06:08.960]  look at us like we're
[03:06:08.960 --> 03:06:09.720]  crazy. I mean, how
[03:06:09.720 --> 03:06:10.680]  many times do we have
[03:06:10.680 --> 03:06:15.640]  to be correct? And
[03:06:15.640 --> 03:06:16.560]  we're now building two
[03:06:16.560 --> 03:06:17.160]  camps. We have the
[03:06:17.160 --> 03:06:18.120]  camps of losers and
[03:06:18.120 --> 03:06:18.920]  winners, and the
[03:06:18.920 --> 03:06:19.680]  winners are telling the
[03:06:19.680 --> 03:06:20.840]  truth and the losers
[03:06:20.840 --> 03:06:21.800]  are just adopting all
[03:06:21.800 --> 03:06:22.560]  of the slave mind
[03:06:22.560 --> 03:06:23.520]  programming. And
[03:06:23.520 --> 03:06:24.880]  unfortunately it's
[03:06:24.880 --> 03:06:25.480]  becoming more and
[03:06:25.480 --> 03:06:26.520]  more dangerous now to
[03:06:26.520 --> 03:06:27.320]  even say the truth
[03:06:27.320 --> 03:06:28.120]  because these losers
[03:06:28.120 --> 03:06:29.440]  band together like
[03:06:29.440 --> 03:06:30.800]  hyenas and attack
[03:06:30.800 --> 03:06:31.680]  anybody who stands up
[03:06:31.680 --> 03:06:32.320]  and tells the truth
[03:06:32.400 --> 03:06:33.120]  like they've attacked
[03:06:33.120 --> 03:06:33.600]  you and like they've
[03:06:33.600 --> 03:06:34.600]  attacked me. They
[03:06:34.600 --> 03:06:35.440]  literally want to turn
[03:06:35.440 --> 03:06:36.440]  us into pod people.
[03:06:36.880 --> 03:06:37.840]  Oh, absolutely. Pod
[03:06:37.840 --> 03:06:38.960]  people and pod
[03:06:38.960 --> 03:06:40.000]  people can't have any
[03:06:40.040 --> 03:06:41.680]  remnants of warrior
[03:06:41.680 --> 03:06:42.720]  spirit inside of them
[03:06:42.720 --> 03:06:43.120]  because they're not
[03:06:43.120 --> 03:06:43.600]  gonna be able to live
[03:06:43.600 --> 03:06:44.720]  in their pod. So this
[03:06:44.720 --> 03:06:45.760]  is the point. The
[03:06:45.760 --> 03:06:47.040]  world's over in 2030.
[03:06:47.040 --> 03:06:47.880]  Why go to the gym?
[03:06:47.880 --> 03:06:48.880]  Why get strong? Why
[03:06:48.880 --> 03:06:49.960]  work hard? Why get
[03:06:49.960 --> 03:06:51.000]  rich? Why be funny?
[03:06:51.000 --> 03:06:52.160]  Why be charismatic? Why
[03:06:52.160 --> 03:06:52.720]  do anything? It
[03:06:52.720 --> 03:06:53.240]  doesn't matter. The
[03:06:53.240 --> 03:06:53.640]  world's going to
[03:06:53.640 --> 03:06:54.640]  end. Sit in your pod.
[03:06:54.760 --> 03:06:56.160]  How dare you? And
[03:06:56.160 --> 03:06:57.040]  all of these leftist
[03:06:57.040 --> 03:06:58.640]  policies are designed to
[03:06:58.640 --> 03:07:00.040]  create a slave class
[03:07:00.040 --> 03:07:01.560]  of people which have
[03:07:01.560 --> 03:07:02.640]  no interest in trying
[03:07:02.640 --> 03:07:03.680]  to preserve the
[03:07:03.680 --> 03:07:05.080]  sanctity of the
[03:07:05.120 --> 03:07:06.000]  nations. They live
[03:07:06.000 --> 03:07:06.920]  with it. The people
[03:07:06.920 --> 03:07:07.960]  who are in charge of
[03:07:07.960 --> 03:07:09.200]  the planet, who are in
[03:07:09.200 --> 03:07:10.000]  charge of global
[03:07:10.000 --> 03:07:10.920]  finance, make all the
[03:07:10.920 --> 03:07:11.760]  important decisions and
[03:07:11.760 --> 03:07:12.360]  who are in charge of
[03:07:12.360 --> 03:07:13.760]  money. They are called
[03:07:13.760 --> 03:07:14.600]  globalists for a
[03:07:14.600 --> 03:07:15.920]  reason. They have no
[03:07:15.920 --> 03:07:17.120]  particular interest in
[03:07:17.120 --> 03:07:18.520]  any one country. All
[03:07:18.520 --> 03:07:19.200]  they care about is
[03:07:19.200 --> 03:07:20.600]  control and maximizing
[03:07:20.600 --> 03:07:21.360]  profits. And I don't
[03:07:21.360 --> 03:07:22.000]  think many people
[03:07:22.000 --> 03:07:23.160]  understand that. You
[03:07:23.160 --> 03:07:25.880]  build on nothing. What
[03:07:25.880 --> 03:07:28.280]  you build is happening.
[03:07:29.280 --> 03:07:29.960]  The globalists are
[03:07:29.960 --> 03:07:31.160]  threatened by men being
[03:07:31.160 --> 03:07:32.400]  independent because they
[03:07:32.400 --> 03:07:33.640]  can't be pushed around
[03:07:33.640 --> 03:07:34.400]  and controlled. If they
[03:07:34.400 --> 03:07:35.720]  don't have men in the
[03:07:35.720 --> 03:07:36.520]  way, the globalists are
[03:07:36.520 --> 03:07:37.360]  going to roll over us.
[03:07:37.400 --> 03:07:38.320]  They want us all
[03:07:38.320 --> 03:07:38.920]  miserable on
[03:07:38.920 --> 03:07:39.880]  antidepressants, eating
[03:07:39.880 --> 03:07:40.720]  the bugs, watching the
[03:07:40.720 --> 03:07:42.000]  TV shows, because then
[03:07:42.000 --> 03:07:42.800]  when something happens
[03:07:42.800 --> 03:07:44.000]  down the street, that's
[03:07:44.000 --> 03:07:44.960]  not supposed to happen.
[03:07:45.160 --> 03:07:46.360]  We don't care. That's
[03:07:46.360 --> 03:07:47.720]  all war ever is. And
[03:07:47.720 --> 03:07:49.000]  life is war. We are
[03:07:49.000 --> 03:07:50.040]  fighting a war right
[03:07:50.040 --> 03:07:50.920]  now. And there was a
[03:07:50.920 --> 03:07:52.200]  war against our minds.
[03:07:53.240 --> 03:07:54.520]  That interview is over
[03:07:54.520 --> 03:07:55.760]  the top. That's the
[03:07:55.760 --> 03:07:56.480]  best we've ever done.

[03:08:00.800 --> 03:08:01.720]  tells you the truth
[03:08:01.720 --> 03:08:02.680]  about what's happening

[03:08:26.400 --> 03:08:27.880]  And we are here in
[03:08:27.880 --> 03:08:29.200]  Austin, Texas. I am
[03:08:29.200 --> 03:08:30.160]  your guest host Drew
[03:08:30.160 --> 03:08:31.640]  Hernandez here on the
[03:08:31.640 --> 03:08:33.080]  fourth hour of the Alex
[03:08:33.080 --> 03:08:34.760]  Jones show. Good to
[03:08:34.760 --> 03:08:35.640]  see every single one of
[03:08:35.640 --> 03:08:36.720]  you guys in studio.
[03:08:36.720 --> 03:08:38.160]  Usually I'll be in via
[03:08:38.160 --> 03:08:39.800]  Skype or remotely, but
[03:08:39.800 --> 03:08:40.960]  I'm here in studio to
[03:08:40.960 --> 03:08:41.880]  take on the fourth
[03:08:41.880 --> 03:08:42.560]  hour. Good to see
[03:08:42.560 --> 03:08:43.360]  every single one of you
[03:08:43.360 --> 03:08:44.400]  guys. Listen, I'll be
[03:08:44.400 --> 03:08:45.680]  honest with you. You
[03:08:45.680 --> 03:08:46.560]  take a look at this
[03:08:46.560 --> 03:08:47.600]  mug shot with Donald
[03:08:47.600 --> 03:08:48.960]  J. Trump. You take a
[03:08:48.960 --> 03:08:49.880]  look at the attack on
[03:08:49.880 --> 03:08:51.160]  our civil liberties. You
[03:08:51.160 --> 03:08:51.760]  take a look at the
[03:08:51.760 --> 03:08:52.640]  attack on the United
[03:08:52.640 --> 03:08:53.920]  States of America. You
[03:08:53.920 --> 03:08:54.680]  take a look at that.
[03:08:54.680 --> 03:08:55.320]  That is, that is a
[03:08:55.320 --> 03:08:56.760]  mirror. Okay. When
[03:08:56.760 --> 03:08:57.440]  you take a look at
[03:08:57.440 --> 03:08:58.880]  that mug shot, that's
[03:08:58.880 --> 03:09:00.280]  you, that's a mirror.
[03:09:00.280 --> 03:09:00.960]  That's you, that's
[03:09:00.960 --> 03:09:02.480]  me. That's your mom.
[03:09:02.640 --> 03:09:03.520]  That's your dad.
[03:09:03.720 --> 03:09:04.920]  That's your teacher.
[03:09:05.000 --> 03:09:05.760]  Okay. That's your
[03:09:05.760 --> 03:09:06.560]  loved one. That's your
[03:09:06.560 --> 03:09:07.800]  grandmother. That's
[03:09:07.800 --> 03:09:09.080]  every single one of us.
[03:09:09.200 --> 03:09:10.080]  If you're living right
[03:09:10.080 --> 03:09:11.240]  now in this simulation
[03:09:11.240 --> 03:09:11.880]  that they're trying to
[03:09:11.880 --> 03:09:12.920]  cultivate for every
[03:09:12.920 --> 03:09:13.960]  single one of us, and
[03:09:13.960 --> 03:09:15.480]  you cannot realize by
[03:09:15.480 --> 03:09:16.680]  this point in this
[03:09:16.680 --> 03:09:18.160]  time, right now in the
[03:09:18.160 --> 03:09:18.880]  United States of
[03:09:18.880 --> 03:09:19.720]  America, that
[03:09:19.720 --> 03:09:20.920]  everything, absolutely
[03:09:20.960 --> 03:09:22.440]  everything is on the
[03:09:22.440 --> 03:09:25.200]  line. Everything, our
[03:09:25.200 --> 03:09:26.880]  freedoms, our lives. It's
[03:09:26.880 --> 03:09:27.960]  no longer even Trump
[03:09:27.960 --> 03:09:29.960]  2024 MAGA anymore.
[03:09:30.160 --> 03:09:31.480]  It's just do or die
[03:09:31.600 --> 03:09:33.200]  2024. That's it.
[03:09:33.200 --> 03:09:34.800]  Campaign slogan moving
[03:09:34.840 --> 03:09:36.560]  forward for the rest of
[03:09:36.560 --> 03:09:37.720]  time for the United
[03:09:37.720 --> 03:09:39.240]  States of America will
[03:09:39.240 --> 03:09:42.360]  be do or die 2024.
[03:09:42.560 --> 03:09:43.440]  And you ask yourself
[03:09:43.440 --> 03:09:44.840]  why, because this has
[03:09:44.840 --> 03:09:46.360]  gone way far beyond
[03:09:46.360 --> 03:09:47.720]  Republican or Democrat.
[03:09:47.840 --> 03:09:49.280]  This has gone way far
[03:09:49.280 --> 03:09:50.560]  beyond left or right.
[03:09:50.640 --> 03:09:51.920]  This has gone way far
[03:09:51.920 --> 03:09:53.600]  beyond just the
[03:09:53.600 --> 03:09:54.760]  political difference of
[03:09:54.760 --> 03:09:56.280]  an opinion. Everybody
[03:09:56.280 --> 03:09:58.240]  knows it. Good versus
[03:09:58.280 --> 03:10:00.000]  evil, the devil versus
[03:10:00.000 --> 03:10:01.600]  Satan, the pedophile
[03:10:01.600 --> 03:10:02.480]  groomers are going
[03:10:02.480 --> 03:10:04.000]  after our children. The
[03:10:04.000 --> 03:10:05.320]  New World Order. Satanists
[03:10:05.320 --> 03:10:07.200]  are raping everybody of
[03:10:07.280 --> 03:10:09.640]  private ownership and
[03:10:09.640 --> 03:10:10.800]  autonomy, where
[03:10:10.800 --> 03:10:11.640]  everything will be a
[03:10:11.640 --> 03:10:13.280]  renter society, a 15
[03:10:13.280 --> 03:10:14.680]  minute city. We have to
[03:10:14.680 --> 03:10:15.560]  ask permission for
[03:10:15.560 --> 03:10:16.720]  everything. Even to go
[03:10:16.720 --> 03:10:18.040]  take a piss. You got
[03:10:18.040 --> 03:10:18.880]  to ask for permission for
[03:10:18.880 --> 03:10:20.280]  that. You want to go
[03:10:20.280 --> 03:10:21.440]  take a dump? You got to
[03:10:21.440 --> 03:10:22.680]  ask Bill Gates for that
[03:10:22.680 --> 03:10:24.760]  too. All right. You
[03:10:24.760 --> 03:10:25.560]  want to scratch your
[03:10:25.560 --> 03:10:26.120]  back? You want to
[03:10:26.120 --> 03:10:27.520]  scratch yourself? You
[03:10:27.520 --> 03:10:28.720]  got an itch? You got to
[03:10:28.720 --> 03:10:30.360]  ask Klaus Schwab if you
[03:10:30.360 --> 03:10:31.600]  could itch that itch.
[03:10:31.720 --> 03:10:33.000]  Okay, listen, these
[03:10:33.000 --> 03:10:33.840]  people are not only
[03:10:33.840 --> 03:10:35.000]  going to attempt to
[03:10:35.000 --> 03:10:36.400]  monetize everything,
[03:10:36.560 --> 03:10:37.960]  monetize your pain,
[03:10:38.200 --> 03:10:39.760]  monetize sickness,
[03:10:39.880 --> 03:10:41.480]  monetize your fear,
[03:10:41.560 --> 03:10:43.440]  monetize everything that
[03:10:43.440 --> 03:10:44.640]  goes against what you
[03:10:44.640 --> 03:10:45.840]  believe, which is good,
[03:10:45.880 --> 03:10:47.440]  honest and true. That
[03:10:47.440 --> 03:10:49.600]  stands for God. But
[03:10:49.600 --> 03:10:50.120]  they're also going to
[03:10:50.120 --> 03:10:51.920]  manipulate it so they can
[03:10:51.920 --> 03:10:53.400]  weaponize it. And it's a
[03:10:53.400 --> 03:10:54.600]  total technic, like
[03:10:54.840 --> 03:10:55.600]  really think about what
[03:10:55.600 --> 03:10:56.160]  they're doing, right
[03:10:56.160 --> 03:10:57.480]  with the technology. So
[03:10:57.480 --> 03:10:58.640]  everything is monetized
[03:10:58.640 --> 03:10:59.000]  and it's all
[03:10:59.000 --> 03:11:00.120]  technologically advanced.
[03:11:00.120 --> 03:11:01.960]  So it's power controlled
[03:11:02.440 --> 03:11:04.000]  so that no one has any
[03:11:04.000 --> 03:11:05.200]  personal autonomy moving
[03:11:05.200 --> 03:11:06.920]  forward. But I want to
[03:11:06.920 --> 03:11:07.880]  continue to speak about
[03:11:07.880 --> 03:11:08.960]  this Trump mugshot because
[03:11:08.960 --> 03:11:09.680]  what happened, listen,
[03:11:09.680 --> 03:11:10.480]  what we're seeing right
[03:11:10.480 --> 03:11:11.760]  now in the United States
[03:11:11.760 --> 03:11:13.000]  of America, I talked a
[03:11:13.000 --> 03:11:13.880]  little bit about this
[03:11:13.880 --> 03:11:14.840]  with Harrison Smith this
[03:11:14.840 --> 03:11:15.600]  morning, go watch that
[03:11:15.600 --> 03:11:16.480]  on the American journal,
[03:11:16.720 --> 03:11:17.560]  total base interview,
[03:11:17.560 --> 03:11:19.840]  total based episode. But
[03:11:19.840 --> 03:11:20.840]  I think what the deep
[03:11:20.840 --> 03:11:21.720]  state and the new world
[03:11:21.720 --> 03:11:22.480]  order is failing to
[03:11:22.480 --> 03:11:24.680]  recognize is that when
[03:11:24.680 --> 03:11:25.600]  they pull these kinds of
[03:11:25.600 --> 03:11:27.320]  operations, it's very
[03:11:27.320 --> 03:11:29.600]  similar to 2016 because
[03:11:29.600 --> 03:11:30.920]  2016, the fake news
[03:11:30.960 --> 03:11:32.920]  media cartel, CNN,
[03:11:33.000 --> 03:11:34.200]  even cucked out Fox
[03:11:34.200 --> 03:11:36.120]  News, all these losers
[03:11:36.120 --> 03:11:37.320]  and these, you know,
[03:11:37.320 --> 03:11:38.200]  these betas in the
[03:11:38.200 --> 03:11:39.680]  mainstream media, all
[03:11:39.680 --> 03:11:40.800]  the attacks on Trump,
[03:11:40.800 --> 03:11:41.920]  the slanders on Trump,
[03:11:41.920 --> 03:11:43.400]  the attacks on MAGA,
[03:11:43.400 --> 03:11:44.400]  the attacks on anyone
[03:11:44.400 --> 03:11:45.880]  that's a patriot. Just
[03:11:45.880 --> 03:11:46.800]  remove Trump for a
[03:11:46.800 --> 03:11:48.120]  second and just put
[03:11:48.120 --> 03:11:48.920]  yourself in that
[03:11:48.920 --> 03:11:50.320]  position. Everything you
[03:11:50.320 --> 03:11:51.280]  stand for is going to
[03:11:51.280 --> 03:11:51.960]  get slandered in the
[03:11:51.960 --> 03:11:53.160]  same way. You see,
[03:11:53.160 --> 03:11:54.200]  all this does is it
[03:11:54.200 --> 03:11:55.920]  causes the revolution to
[03:11:55.920 --> 03:11:57.400]  grow. All this does is
[03:11:57.400 --> 03:11:58.880]  it causes the freedom
[03:11:58.880 --> 03:12:00.520]  movement to even further
[03:12:00.520 --> 03:12:01.960]  advance. What this
[03:12:01.960 --> 03:12:02.920]  does is it causes
[03:12:02.920 --> 03:12:05.320]  everyone to unify around
[03:12:05.320 --> 03:12:06.320]  what the United States
[03:12:06.320 --> 03:12:08.000]  of America is. And
[03:12:08.000 --> 03:12:08.800]  it's a good thing. And
[03:12:08.800 --> 03:12:09.600]  the reason why I say
[03:12:09.600 --> 03:12:10.760]  it's a good thing is
[03:12:10.760 --> 03:12:12.000]  because listen, so many
[03:12:12.000 --> 03:12:13.000]  people are still getting
[03:12:13.000 --> 03:12:14.280]  red pilled. So many
[03:12:14.280 --> 03:12:15.160]  people are still getting
[03:12:15.160 --> 03:12:16.560]  Christ pilled. And you
[03:12:16.560 --> 03:12:17.400]  ask yourself, why is
[03:12:17.400 --> 03:12:18.120]  that continuing to
[03:12:18.120 --> 03:12:19.080]  happen? Because the
[03:12:19.080 --> 03:12:20.280]  reality of evil will
[03:12:20.280 --> 03:12:21.760]  always push that the
[03:12:21.760 --> 03:12:23.200]  reality of evil will
[03:12:23.200 --> 03:12:25.080]  always push. Okay.
[03:12:25.080 --> 03:12:27.040]  People to realize number
[03:12:27.040 --> 03:12:29.040]  one, that evil is
[03:12:29.040 --> 03:12:30.400]  abundantly a reality in
[03:12:30.400 --> 03:12:31.200]  the world that they live
[03:12:31.200 --> 03:12:32.960]  in, but also it'll push
[03:12:32.960 --> 03:12:34.400]  them to the reality of
[03:12:34.400 --> 03:12:35.520]  God. What is the God
[03:12:35.520 --> 03:12:37.440]  reality? Well, God is
[03:12:37.440 --> 03:12:38.880]  reality because God is
[03:12:38.880 --> 03:12:40.640]  truth. And if God is
[03:12:40.640 --> 03:12:42.840]  truth, then God has not
[03:12:42.840 --> 03:12:45.520]  only programmed the
[03:12:45.520 --> 03:12:46.440]  universe, he's the
[03:12:46.440 --> 03:12:47.560]  chief architect of the
[03:12:47.560 --> 03:12:49.119]  universe. He's the
[03:12:49.119 --> 03:12:51.440]  chief architect of the
[03:12:51.440 --> 03:12:52.560]  realities that we can
[03:12:52.560 --> 03:12:54.960]  see the multi-dimensional
[03:12:54.960 --> 03:12:55.840]  world that every single
[03:12:55.840 --> 03:12:56.320]  one of us are
[03:12:56.320 --> 03:12:58.040]  experiencing. But when
[03:12:58.040 --> 03:12:59.240]  people wake up to that
[03:12:59.240 --> 03:13:00.400]  fundamental reality and
[03:13:00.400 --> 03:13:01.600]  they get connected with
[03:13:01.600 --> 03:13:02.840]  their creator, it's over
[03:13:02.840 --> 03:13:04.880]  dude. It's over for
[03:13:04.880 --> 03:13:06.119]  everyone that's opposing
[03:13:06.119 --> 03:13:07.119]  God, because once you're
[03:13:07.119 --> 03:13:08.400]  unlocked, once you're
[03:13:08.400 --> 03:13:09.280]  plugged out of the
[03:13:09.280 --> 03:13:10.920]  matrix, once you are
[03:13:10.920 --> 03:13:13.119]  truly red, God, Christ
[03:13:13.119 --> 03:13:14.600]  pilled in your mind is
[03:13:14.600 --> 03:13:16.320]  taken into a place where
[03:13:16.320 --> 03:13:17.560]  you're no longer a slave
[03:13:17.560 --> 03:13:18.360]  or you're no longer
[03:13:18.360 --> 03:13:19.760]  bound to Satan and the
[03:13:19.760 --> 03:13:21.320]  kingdom of darkness, you
[03:13:21.320 --> 03:13:22.280]  really start to get
[03:13:22.280 --> 03:13:23.920]  activated. And you see,
[03:13:23.920 --> 03:13:24.800]  this is truly what a
[03:13:24.800 --> 03:13:26.400]  great awakening truly is.
[03:13:26.560 --> 03:13:27.440]  And this is why info
[03:13:27.440 --> 03:13:28.800]  wars is important. This is
[03:13:28.800 --> 03:13:29.880]  why exposing the new
[03:13:29.880 --> 03:13:30.400]  world order and the
[03:13:30.400 --> 03:13:31.800]  global regime and cabal
[03:13:31.800 --> 03:13:33.320]  is important because when
[03:13:33.320 --> 03:13:34.520]  people see this for what
[03:13:34.520 --> 03:13:36.240]  it really is, it becomes
[03:13:36.240 --> 03:13:38.520]  hard to disprove. It's
[03:13:38.520 --> 03:13:39.880]  harder to disprove the
[03:13:39.880 --> 03:13:41.440]  new world order. Okay.
[03:13:41.560 --> 03:13:42.680]  Then it is to prove it
[03:13:42.680 --> 03:13:44.680]  now in 2023. And I know
[03:13:44.680 --> 03:13:45.680]  all the info warriors
[03:13:45.680 --> 03:13:47.800]  know this, but guys, what
[03:13:47.800 --> 03:13:48.920]  a time to be alive right
[03:13:48.920 --> 03:13:50.200]  now, where you and I
[03:13:50.200 --> 03:13:51.360]  are on the front lines
[03:13:51.360 --> 03:13:52.280]  fighting for the future
[03:13:52.280 --> 03:13:53.080]  of the United States of
[03:13:53.080 --> 03:13:54.360]  America, fighting for the
[03:13:54.360 --> 03:13:55.440]  future of our children,
[03:13:55.560 --> 03:13:56.440]  fighting for the future
[03:13:56.440 --> 03:13:57.840]  of society. And every
[03:13:57.880 --> 03:13:58.760]  single one of us play a
[03:13:58.760 --> 03:14:01.360]  part right now. And I
[03:14:01.360 --> 03:14:02.400]  know this has said a lot
[03:14:02.400 --> 03:14:03.400]  every single election
[03:14:03.400 --> 03:14:04.280]  cycle. This is the most
[03:14:04.280 --> 03:14:05.680]  important election of our
[03:14:05.680 --> 03:14:06.480]  time. This is the most
[03:14:06.480 --> 03:14:07.880]  important election of our
[03:14:07.880 --> 03:14:09.760]  time. This is far beyond
[03:14:09.760 --> 03:14:11.200]  an election. This is far
[03:14:11.200 --> 03:14:13.800]  beyond a selection. This
[03:14:13.800 --> 03:14:14.600]  is whether you're going
[03:14:14.600 --> 03:14:15.520]  to allow, listen, this is
[03:14:15.520 --> 03:14:16.560]  what it comes down to.
[03:14:16.760 --> 03:14:17.560]  It's either you're going
[03:14:17.560 --> 03:14:19.880]  to allow these notorious
[03:14:19.920 --> 03:14:21.960]  powerful deep state global
[03:14:21.960 --> 03:14:24.119]  cabal pedophiles. Okay.
[03:14:24.160 --> 03:14:25.240]  That are all targeting
[03:14:25.240 --> 03:14:26.280]  your children. It's
[03:14:26.280 --> 03:14:26.960]  either you're going to
[03:14:26.960 --> 03:14:28.920]  allow that to continue to
[03:14:28.920 --> 03:14:30.840]  advance in your society,
[03:14:30.920 --> 03:14:32.520]  in your culture, in your
[03:14:32.520 --> 03:14:34.240]  community, in your church,
[03:14:34.320 --> 03:14:36.560]  in your kid's school, you
[03:14:36.560 --> 03:14:38.080]  name it, dude. So they're
[03:14:38.080 --> 03:14:39.880]  going to allow that. Are
[03:14:39.880 --> 03:14:41.040]  you going to plant your
[03:14:41.040 --> 03:14:41.960]  two feet in the ground
[03:14:41.960 --> 03:14:42.400]  and you're going to say,
[03:14:42.400 --> 03:14:45.000]  no, hell no, no longer,
[03:14:45.040 --> 03:14:46.200]  no more. We will not
[03:14:46.200 --> 03:14:47.600]  stand for degeneracy. We
[03:14:47.600 --> 03:14:48.520]  will not stand for
[03:14:48.520 --> 03:14:50.040]  evil. We will not stand
[03:14:50.040 --> 03:14:51.440]  for Satanism. We will
[03:14:51.440 --> 03:14:52.800]  not stand for everything.
[03:14:52.800 --> 03:14:54.040]  That's opposite of God.
[03:14:55.040 --> 03:14:56.040]  Flood the schools with
[03:14:56.040 --> 03:14:58.640]  Christ, flood politics,
[03:14:58.640 --> 03:14:59.680]  flood the government with
[03:14:59.680 --> 03:15:02.160]  Christ, flood education
[03:15:02.160 --> 03:15:04.400]  with Jesus Christ flooded
[03:15:04.400 --> 03:15:05.720]  all everything. The
[03:15:05.720 --> 03:15:07.760]  sciences, the medical
[03:15:07.760 --> 03:15:09.440]  healthcare industry flooded
[03:15:09.440 --> 03:15:11.000]  all with Christ, with
[03:15:11.000 --> 03:15:12.840]  godly men and women that
[03:15:12.840 --> 03:15:13.800]  care and that are in
[03:15:13.800 --> 03:15:15.720]  obedience and submission to
[03:15:15.720 --> 03:15:17.280]  our creator. Why is that
[03:15:17.280 --> 03:15:19.000]  such a bad idea? Why is
[03:15:19.000 --> 03:15:21.080]  that such a bad idea? You
[03:15:21.080 --> 03:15:21.880]  see, you start triggering
[03:15:21.880 --> 03:15:22.560]  the liberals. When you
[03:15:22.560 --> 03:15:23.960]  talk like this, Oh, drill,
[03:15:24.000 --> 03:15:24.920]  you're just a Christian
[03:15:24.920 --> 03:15:25.960]  fascist. Oh my gosh, a
[03:15:25.960 --> 03:15:27.119]  Christian national. Oh my
[03:15:27.119 --> 03:15:27.840]  God. Well, what do you
[03:15:27.840 --> 03:15:29.520]  suggest? Huh? Some kind of
[03:15:29.520 --> 03:15:30.240]  society where the
[03:15:30.240 --> 03:15:31.720]  pedophiles are given a
[03:15:31.720 --> 03:15:33.560]  slap on the wrist and
[03:15:33.560 --> 03:15:34.200]  they're allowed to come
[03:15:34.200 --> 03:15:36.520]  after your children to
[03:15:36.520 --> 03:15:37.800]  each their own. I don't
[03:15:37.800 --> 03:15:38.720]  really care. Well, you
[03:15:38.720 --> 03:15:39.680]  know what? I do care
[03:15:39.680 --> 03:15:41.600]  because God cares and
[03:15:41.600 --> 03:15:43.000]  God calls the degenerates
[03:15:43.000 --> 03:15:44.280]  to repent. And if we're
[03:15:44.280 --> 03:15:45.480]  going to have a shot at
[03:15:45.480 --> 03:15:46.880]  winning anything back, then
[03:15:46.880 --> 03:15:48.880]  we have to bend the knee
[03:15:49.000 --> 03:15:49.840]  to Christ. That's the
[03:15:49.840 --> 03:15:51.800]  only way. Otherwise we
[03:15:51.800 --> 03:15:53.000]  lose. We'll be right
[03:15:53.000 --> 03:15:53.480]  back.
[03:15:55.920 --> 03:15:57.360]  Info Wars is a one of a
[03:15:57.360 --> 03:15:59.119]  kind operation. And so
[03:15:59.119 --> 03:16:00.680]  please go to info store
[03:16:00.680 --> 03:16:01.760]  and just make a donation
[03:16:02.240 --> 03:16:03.119]  and you can make it one
[03:16:03.119 --> 03:16:04.400]  time or recurring. You
[03:16:04.400 --> 03:16:05.080]  have a little profile
[03:16:05.080 --> 03:16:06.480]  there. Cancel anytime.
[03:16:07.280 --> 03:16:08.400]  Every 15 days, every
[03:16:08.400 --> 03:16:09.800]  month, every three
[03:16:09.800 --> 03:16:10.720]  months, every six months,
[03:16:10.720 --> 03:16:12.760]  up to nine months, you
[03:16:12.760 --> 03:16:14.320]  can go in and every
[03:16:14.320 --> 03:16:15.119]  month or every week,
[03:16:15.400 --> 03:16:15.920]  whenever you want, you
[03:16:15.920 --> 03:16:16.720]  program it, you just
[03:16:16.720 --> 03:16:17.840]  click it and then you
[03:16:17.840 --> 03:16:18.520]  decide when you want to
[03:16:18.520 --> 03:16:19.600]  make a donation. So
[03:16:19.600 --> 03:16:20.480]  please do that as well.
[03:16:20.480 --> 03:16:21.760]  That way we get 95% of
[03:16:21.760 --> 03:16:22.520]  it after credit card
[03:16:22.520 --> 03:16:23.960]  fees that make it 20, 30,
[03:16:24.480 --> 03:16:25.920]  40% like we do on the
[03:16:25.920 --> 03:16:26.520]  products. But these
[03:16:26.520 --> 03:16:27.160]  really are amazing
[03:16:27.160 --> 03:16:28.320]  products. The big July
[03:16:28.320 --> 03:16:29.360]  four cells going on right
[03:16:29.360 --> 03:16:30.440]  now, this is such a
[03:16:30.440 --> 03:16:31.320]  critical platform in the
[03:16:31.320 --> 03:16:31.960]  fight against the new
[03:16:31.960 --> 03:16:32.640]  world order. The
[03:16:32.640 --> 03:16:33.600]  enemies out in the open
[03:16:33.600 --> 03:16:34.720]  were vindicated. People
[03:16:34.720 --> 03:16:35.360]  are listening more than
[03:16:35.360 --> 03:16:36.840]  ever, but in this major
[03:16:36.840 --> 03:16:37.600]  recession going into
[03:16:37.600 --> 03:16:38.800]  depression and with
[03:16:38.800 --> 03:16:39.720]  supply chain breakdowns,
[03:16:39.720 --> 03:16:41.080]  I know it's hard. I
[03:16:41.080 --> 03:16:42.240]  know times are tough. So
[03:16:42.440 --> 03:16:42.960]  thank you for your
[03:16:42.960 --> 03:16:44.040]  support, but whatever you
[03:16:44.040 --> 03:16:44.480]  do, pray for the
[03:16:44.480 --> 03:16:45.800]  broadcast and share the
[03:16:45.800 --> 03:16:46.960]  articles and the videos
[03:16:47.160 --> 03:16:47.960]  that you can do for
[03:16:47.960 --> 03:16:48.960]  free. And that's just
[03:16:48.960 --> 03:16:49.800]  as important as
[03:16:49.800 --> 03:16:50.800]  keeping us on air. So
[03:16:50.800 --> 03:16:51.800]  however, God leads you
[03:16:51.800 --> 03:16:52.240]  in your heart to
[03:16:52.240 --> 03:16:53.200]  support us, please
[03:16:53.240 --> 03:16:54.119]  support us now. And I
[03:16:54.119 --> 03:16:54.560]  thank you for the
[03:16:54.560 --> 03:16:55.800]  bottom of my heart. God
[03:16:55.800 --> 03:16:56.520]  bless you for
[03:16:56.520 --> 03:16:57.720]  everything. The global
[03:16:57.720 --> 03:16:59.440]  has hit us with God
[03:16:59.480 --> 03:17:00.280]  through mother nature
[03:17:00.280 --> 03:17:01.280]  has given us the answer.
[03:17:02.000 --> 03:17:02.720]  I don't have to sell you
[03:17:02.720 --> 03:17:04.000]  on CBD oil, full
[03:17:04.000 --> 03:17:05.080]  spectrum of CBD oil,
[03:17:05.240 --> 03:17:06.119]  the incredible things it
[03:17:06.119 --> 03:17:06.960]  does for your nerves,
[03:17:06.960 --> 03:17:08.640]  your brain, your entire
[03:17:08.640 --> 03:17:10.760]  physiological system for
[03:17:10.760 --> 03:17:11.680]  your nervous system,
[03:17:11.680 --> 03:17:12.960]  particularly everybody
[03:17:12.960 --> 03:17:13.920]  knows it's incredible. It
[03:17:13.920 --> 03:17:15.160]  works. We have the
[03:17:15.160 --> 03:17:16.800]  strongest, best CBD oil.
[03:17:16.800 --> 03:17:17.360]  You're going to find
[03:17:17.360 --> 03:17:19.040]  anywhere at the lowest
[03:17:19.040 --> 03:17:20.240]  price. Yes, you can
[03:17:20.240 --> 03:17:22.000]  find this same CBD oil
[03:17:22.240 --> 03:17:24.800]  for 30% more because
[03:17:24.800 --> 03:17:25.240]  that's who we're
[03:17:25.240 --> 03:17:26.480]  getting it from made
[03:17:26.480 --> 03:17:28.040]  right here in central
[03:17:28.040 --> 03:17:29.480]  Texas. Our private
[03:17:29.480 --> 03:17:31.160]  label name is rebel
[03:17:31.360 --> 03:17:33.640]  sin rebels in is a
[03:17:33.640 --> 03:17:35.280]  private label of one
[03:17:35.280 --> 03:17:36.119]  of the top three or
[03:17:36.119 --> 03:17:37.440]  four CBD makers in the
[03:17:37.440 --> 03:17:38.600]  country. It's based
[03:17:38.600 --> 03:17:39.440]  right here in Texas,
[03:17:39.440 --> 03:17:40.160]  and we're giving it to
[03:17:40.160 --> 03:17:41.400]  you at 30% off. And
[03:17:41.400 --> 03:17:41.840]  here's what's even
[03:17:41.840 --> 03:17:43.680]  crazier 30% off of
[03:17:43.680 --> 03:17:44.280]  what they're selling it
[03:17:44.280 --> 03:17:45.440]  for. They're selling
[03:17:45.440 --> 03:17:46.880]  theirs for 30% off
[03:17:46.880 --> 03:17:47.600]  what their competitors
[03:17:47.600 --> 03:17:48.520]  are. So this is the
[03:17:48.520 --> 03:17:50.040]  highest rated already
[03:17:50.040 --> 03:17:51.280]  the lowest price, not
[03:17:51.400 --> 03:17:52.800]  a lower price rebels
[03:17:52.800 --> 03:17:54.040]  in get yours at
[03:17:54.040 --> 03:17:55.760]  info or store.com. Now
[03:17:56.280 --> 03:17:57.320]  the globalists are only
[03:17:57.320 --> 03:17:58.920]  humans. Yeah, they
[03:17:58.920 --> 03:17:59.640]  have control of the
[03:17:59.640 --> 03:18:00.280]  central banks. They
[03:18:00.280 --> 03:18:01.000]  have a lot of power,
[03:18:01.119 --> 03:18:01.760]  but they can be
[03:18:01.760 --> 03:18:03.000]  defeated. But some of
[03:18:03.000 --> 03:18:03.920]  their operations are
[03:18:03.920 --> 03:18:04.760]  going to take decades
[03:18:04.760 --> 03:18:06.160]  to stop. But one
[03:18:06.160 --> 03:18:06.760]  thing you can do
[03:18:06.760 --> 03:18:07.520]  right now is take
[03:18:07.520 --> 03:18:08.520]  control of your body
[03:18:08.720 --> 03:18:09.720]  and your family's body
[03:18:09.920 --> 03:18:10.880]  by purifying the
[03:18:10.880 --> 03:18:11.960]  water that you drink
[03:18:12.200 --> 03:18:13.240]  and that you cook
[03:18:13.240 --> 03:18:14.600]  with and you do it
[03:18:14.600 --> 03:18:15.200]  with the highest
[03:18:15.200 --> 03:18:16.280]  quality gravity fed
[03:18:16.280 --> 03:18:17.720]  filter out there. This
[03:18:17.720 --> 03:18:18.800]  thing does 10,000
[03:18:18.800 --> 03:18:20.240]  gallons. You can sit
[03:18:20.240 --> 03:18:20.760]  there and put
[03:18:20.800 --> 03:18:21.480]  hundreds of gallons
[03:18:21.480 --> 03:18:22.560]  through it a day. It
[03:18:22.560 --> 03:18:23.720]  purifies very quickly
[03:18:23.720 --> 03:18:24.440]  and it cuts out
[03:18:24.440 --> 03:18:25.480]  thousands of chemicals
[03:18:25.640 --> 03:18:26.560]  to non detectable
[03:18:26.560 --> 03:18:27.440]  levels. This is what
[03:18:27.440 --> 03:18:28.160]  I use, which my
[03:18:28.160 --> 03:18:29.240]  family uses. It's the
[03:18:29.240 --> 03:18:30.160]  very best system out
[03:18:30.160 --> 03:18:30.640]  there for the lowest

[03:18:45.640 --> 03:18:46.040]  This is one of the
[03:18:46.040 --> 03:18:47.320]  main areas we can
[03:18:47.320 --> 03:18:48.000]  take control of our
[03:18:48.000 --> 03:18:49.160]  lives and stop the
[03:18:49.160 --> 03:18:50.080]  globalists from hitting
[03:18:50.080 --> 03:18:51.040]  us with poison that
[03:18:51.040 --> 03:18:51.840]  they allow in the
[03:18:51.840 --> 03:18:52.920]  water supply. In some
[03:18:52.920 --> 03:18:54.000]  cases, they add the
[03:18:54.000 --> 03:18:54.680]  water supply like
[03:18:54.680 --> 03:18:56.600]  fluoride. It's been
[03:18:56.600 --> 03:18:57.520]  three years since we
[03:18:57.520 --> 03:18:59.480]  had it. We got it back
[03:18:59.480 --> 03:19:00.680]  in stock, the amazing
[03:19:00.680 --> 03:19:01.840]  30 parts per million,

[03:24:34.800 --> 03:24:40.960]  Well let's continue with other news today, I wanted to, I actually wanted
[03:24:40.960 --> 03:24:46.160]  to talk about Alex and I talked a little bit about this on my show Drew
[03:24:46.160 --> 03:24:51.420]  Hernandez Live and I wanted to kind of expound a little more on it with the
[03:24:51.420 --> 03:24:56.680]  Infowars family because what I found to be interesting was what
[03:24:56.680 --> 03:25:01.520]  happened with Alex, I think it was last week, dropping the news with the
[03:25:01.520 --> 03:25:06.920]  federal whistleblowers of the oncoming possible lockdowns, obvious
[03:25:06.920 --> 03:25:09.680]  restrictions that we're seeing in the news, there's countless
[03:25:09.680 --> 03:25:13.600]  articles here all over the desk, I could give you guys just a few examples here,
[03:25:13.600 --> 03:25:18.840]  South Texas school district closed over COVID-19 surge, South district in South
[03:25:18.840 --> 03:25:23.800]  Texas temporarily closes due to uptick in COVID-19 cases, as COVID cases flare
[03:25:23.800 --> 03:25:28.880]  some schools and businesses reinstate mask mandates and the list goes on, a
[03:25:28.880 --> 03:25:33.720]  familiar era safety measure is making a comeback as new COVID-19 variants
[03:25:33.720 --> 03:25:40.199]  surface and cases of the disease flare in some parts of the US mask mandates, I
[03:25:40.199 --> 03:25:44.520]  mean what I found interesting about this was how it happened backwards, did you
[03:25:44.520 --> 03:25:48.440]  guys notice that? Because usually Alex will come out and report on something
[03:25:48.440 --> 03:25:53.119]  maybe like, I don't know, could be 10 years, it could be five years, could be
[03:25:53.119 --> 03:25:57.560]  two years, could be two months ahead of the curve, tomorrow's news today, right?
[03:25:57.560 --> 03:26:01.680]  That's the Infowars slogan, that's what this is all about, but what I found
[03:26:01.720 --> 03:26:06.000]  interesting was how it happened backward, it almost happened backwards, where Alex
[03:26:06.000 --> 03:26:11.720]  got the scoop with something that they would usually slander, you see what I'm
[03:26:11.720 --> 03:26:16.199]  saying? They would usually come out and say, well, Alex Jones conspiracy
[03:26:16.199 --> 03:26:20.160]  theorist is coming out saying it again, that there's gonna be COVID lockdowns
[03:26:20.160 --> 03:26:24.920]  again, what does that mean? What, wow, what is that? Just another
[03:26:24.920 --> 03:26:31.400]  conspiracy theory? That's usually what they do when someone comes out and
[03:26:31.400 --> 03:26:36.600]  reports, but it's like it happened almost backwards, Alex came out with the
[03:26:36.600 --> 03:26:41.240]  federal whistleblowers, it ended up becoming confirmed, and almost within
[03:26:41.240 --> 03:26:46.640]  hours you saw the mainstream media come out and confirm what he was saying
[03:26:46.640 --> 03:26:50.039]  because of the whistleblowers, but here's the point, I thought it was
[03:26:50.039 --> 03:26:57.000]  strange because usually they try to demonize the man, but this time
[03:26:57.000 --> 03:27:00.320]  they try to get ahead of the man, did you guys notice that? Usually if they
[03:27:00.320 --> 03:27:04.840]  try to demonize Infowars, but this time they try to get ahead because they
[03:27:04.840 --> 03:27:09.560]  were behind, and what sticks out to me about this, and I'll talk
[03:27:09.560 --> 03:27:14.840]  about this more when we come back from the break, is I think this does unveil
[03:27:14.840 --> 03:27:20.580]  their plans, this does unveil their plans, you see this report in the AP, the
[03:27:20.580 --> 03:27:23.960]  claim originated on August 18th episode of the Alex Jones show where its
[03:27:23.960 --> 03:27:27.920]  namesake host said an anonymous high-level manager in the TSA,
[03:27:27.920 --> 03:27:31.199]  an unnamed border patrol connected source, told him about the alleged
[03:27:31.199 --> 03:27:34.760]  announcement Jones is known for spreading conspiracy theories, well at the
[03:27:34.760 --> 03:27:40.080]  same time they were attempting to get ahead of the narrative as well, and I
[03:27:40.080 --> 03:27:43.660]  found that to be interesting, I found that to be interesting because I think
[03:27:43.660 --> 03:27:48.800]  this shows us a kind of like a confirmation of the path forward for
[03:27:48.800 --> 03:27:52.840]  the New World Order and particularly for the election, you see we're moving
[03:27:52.840 --> 03:27:57.160]  into a different time where these people don't necessarily have to launch
[03:27:57.199 --> 03:28:01.640]  those attacks, yeah they'll call you a conspiracy theorist here and an article
[03:28:01.640 --> 03:28:05.119]  there and here and an article here, but ultimately now they're just trying to
[03:28:05.119 --> 03:28:08.880]  get ahead of what we're saying, so this is a good indication that the
[03:28:08.880 --> 03:28:12.580]  information that's coming out now is actually doing some damage, but at the
[03:28:12.580 --> 03:28:16.300]  same time they're gonna try and play some catch-up and they're gonna try
[03:28:16.300 --> 03:28:21.039]  to get ahead of the information, but why? Because that's the plan all along, I
[03:28:21.039 --> 03:28:24.320]  think we've been speculating will it be a climate change lockdown, will they
[03:28:24.320 --> 03:28:30.240]  go with the fake alien UFO invasion, but I think it's abundantly clear, here we
[03:28:30.240 --> 03:28:35.359]  are heading into the 2024 election, and what worked in 2020? How did they rig
[03:28:35.359 --> 03:28:42.199]  that election? What's the playbook? Coach Schwab, Coach Gates, huh daddy?
[03:28:42.199 --> 03:28:48.960]  Just launch another variant, mass mail-in ballots, shut down the world,
[03:28:48.960 --> 03:28:53.560]  Jack the United States of America, we'll be right back.
[03:28:54.320 --> 03:29:00.960]  The wicked plot against the righteous and gnash their teeth at them, but the
[03:29:00.960 --> 03:29:05.320]  Lord laughs at the wicked for he knows their day is coming. The wicked
[03:29:05.320 --> 03:29:09.520]  draw the sword and bend the bow to bring down the poor and needy, slay
[03:29:09.520 --> 03:29:13.480]  those whose ways are upright, but their swords will pierce their own
[03:29:13.480 --> 03:29:17.439]  hearts and their bows will be broken. Better the little that have
[03:29:17.439 --> 03:29:21.640]  righteousness than the wealth of any wicked, for the power of the wicked will
[03:29:21.640 --> 03:29:26.680]  be broken, but the Lord upholds the righteous. The blameless spend their
[03:29:26.680 --> 03:29:31.119]  days under the Lord's care, and their inheritance will endure forever. In times
[03:29:31.119 --> 03:29:36.199]  of disaster they will not wither, in days of famine they will not plummet,
[03:29:36.199 --> 03:29:40.760]  but the wicked will perish. Though the Lord's enemies are like the
[03:29:40.760 --> 03:29:46.920]  fires in the field, they will be consumed and they will go up in smoke.
[03:29:55.560 --> 03:30:00.279]  With all the craziness in the world, the collapsing borders, the war with
[03:30:00.279 --> 03:30:04.960]  Russia, the insanity, the currency devaluations, the economy going
[03:30:04.960 --> 03:30:08.920]  crazy, you are crazy in my view if you don't get high-quality storeable
[03:30:08.920 --> 03:30:12.800]  food and water filtration and self-defense. Now we're not selling guns
[03:30:12.800 --> 03:30:15.400]  and ammo, that's for you to go out and get for yourself and learn how to use
[03:30:15.400 --> 03:30:19.199]  if you haven't, and I'm preaching the choir on that, but a lot of people got
[03:30:19.199 --> 03:30:22.119]  plenty of guns but they don't have enough storeable food or water
[03:30:22.119 --> 03:30:25.880]  filtration. This is something you need now and we've got it in the food
[03:30:25.880 --> 03:30:29.740]  department and in the high-quality water filtration department. The highest

[03:31:05.160 --> 03:31:10.199]  economy, we could not get the highest quality Gloidal Silver for almost
[03:31:10.199 --> 03:31:14.320]  three years back in stock. But now we've got it, 30 parts per

[03:31:51.439 --> 03:31:59.880]  I've studied how the globalists, how the mad scientists are
[03:31:59.880 --> 03:32:04.439]  controlling us, and they're doing it by keeping us undernourished. You
[03:32:04.439 --> 03:32:06.400]  can eat all the food you want in the world, but if you
[03:32:06.400 --> 03:32:10.840]  don't have the essential vitamins and minerals in an organic absorbable
[03:32:10.840 --> 03:32:14.240]  form, if you don't have the key elements like iodine, you are
[03:32:14.240 --> 03:32:18.760]  literally like someone in a paddle boat without ores, without paddles.
[03:32:19.400 --> 03:32:23.320]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are running a flash sale, as we're about

[03:32:33.400 --> 03:32:36.400]  this. I could sell it at full price, but I want those of you
[03:32:36.400 --> 03:32:39.600]  that have been on the fence and never tried X3 or never tried

[03:32:43.080 --> 03:32:46.600]  I know you're going to be blown away by the energy, the

[03:32:57.680 --> 03:33:02.080]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order.
[03:33:02.279 --> 03:33:04.039]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:33:05.500 --> 03:33:17.500]  Really tripping out still on this Trump mugshot, man.
[03:33:17.500 --> 03:33:25.500]  A lot of people are saying that it's very similar to the American symbol, the bald eagle.
[03:33:25.500 --> 03:33:30.500]  You guys put that up together? Put the Trump mugshot next to the bald eagle?
[03:33:30.500 --> 03:33:34.500]  I think that's pretty accurate. Very accurate.
[03:33:34.500 --> 03:33:40.500]  That's the face of retribution. Trump 2024. Revenge on the government.
[03:33:40.500 --> 03:33:46.500]  I'll tell you one thing. If you need an example of how much the government hates you, just take a look at Maui.
[03:33:46.500 --> 03:33:53.500]  I spent a lot of time on Maui today on the show, but I want to continue to talk about that because you could just tell by the response.
[03:33:53.500 --> 03:34:02.500]  You could tell by the response of the local government that's supposed to oh so care about the people because they care so much about democracy, don't they?
[03:34:02.500 --> 03:34:11.500]  They care so much about democracy that oh, we have to put a stop to those mega-terrorists, those right-wing domestic terrorist white supremacists.
[03:34:11.500 --> 03:34:17.500]  We've got to put a stop to those pesky Americans that want their pesky freedom.
[03:34:17.500 --> 03:34:25.500]  Yeah, but if you end up in a situation like Maui, you're not going to get an answer from the chief of emergency operations.
[03:34:25.500 --> 03:34:29.500]  Of course he resigns. He'll ride off onto the sunset, protected.
[03:34:29.500 --> 03:34:37.500]  Oh, there you go. Look at that. Look at that. I'm telling you. Something about this, man. I don't know what it is, but there's something about this.
[03:34:37.500 --> 03:34:47.500]  I don't know if he planned that. Wouldn't be surprised if he did, but those photos represent something. I'll tell you that. I'll tell you that.
[03:34:47.500 --> 03:34:52.500]  But back to Maui. Back to Maui, man. I mean, really think about it.
[03:34:52.500 --> 03:34:56.500]  You've got the local government trying to run cover for anything and everything.
[03:34:56.500 --> 03:35:03.500]  Whether it's some kind of intentional controlled demolition of the society or whether they're not letting a good crisis go to waste,
[03:35:03.500 --> 03:35:12.500]  what I can say is the response of the so-called local government is to screw the people, let the people die, let them incinerate.
[03:35:12.500 --> 03:35:19.500]  Oh, and then the Biden administration will come and say, well, here's $700 for you. That's just great.
[03:35:19.500 --> 03:35:30.500]  Here's $700 for a month's worth of milk, some synthetic milk and some synthetic beef brought to you by Bill Gates.
[03:35:30.500 --> 03:35:36.500]  Isn't that just nice? Isn't that just nice? We have to rebuild our community. We don't have money for anything.
[03:35:36.500 --> 03:35:43.500]  Oh, wow. We know. We know. So here's $700 for every single one of you.
[03:35:43.500 --> 03:35:49.500]  And you get this cucked out governor that takes to the media and is like, did you hear that interview? What a, what a, what a cut, dude.
[03:35:49.500 --> 03:35:55.500]  The guy's like, well, I know nobody wants to talk about this, but we have to talk about it. It's climate change.
[03:35:55.500 --> 03:35:58.500]  It's climate change. We told you climate change would get you killed.
[03:35:58.500 --> 03:36:04.500]  So the reason why your grandmother was incinerated and died was because of you.
[03:36:04.500 --> 03:36:09.500]  Because of climate change. It's you. You. You carbon-based life form. You didn't listen.
[03:36:09.500 --> 03:36:11.500]  So your daughter is dead.
[03:36:12.100 --> 03:36:18.140]  You see, it's either you join the cult or you don't.
[03:36:18.140 --> 03:36:26.300]  And Biden rolls through, two weeks later, fallen asleep in the meeting with the community
[03:36:26.300 --> 03:36:28.540]  and the community leaders.
[03:36:28.540 --> 03:36:29.900]  Duke can't even stay awake.
[03:36:29.900 --> 03:36:31.620]  Of course not, because he's dying.
[03:36:31.620 --> 03:36:33.020]  He's literally dying.
[03:36:33.020 --> 03:36:39.300]  Every time we see a video of this guy, we're watching him die.
[03:36:39.300 --> 03:36:43.340]  Did you see the other clip where Biden comes out and he says, oh, well, you know, there
[03:36:43.340 --> 03:36:48.660]  he is, you know, falling asleep while they're all crying, straight catch and seize.
[03:36:48.660 --> 03:36:49.660]  Yeah.
[03:36:49.660 --> 03:36:53.700]  This was the clip where Biden comes out and says, oh, well, you know, I almost, uh, I
[03:36:53.700 --> 03:36:58.660]  almost saw experience of higher to, you know, uh, and uh, I almost lost my 67 Corvette
[03:36:58.660 --> 03:37:06.020]  and, uh, but no kidding aside, just making jokes out of dead kids, making jokes out
[03:37:06.020 --> 03:37:07.020]  of dead children.
[03:37:07.020 --> 03:37:08.020]  Oh yeah.
[03:37:08.020 --> 03:37:09.020]  The team says, we have it.
[03:37:09.020 --> 03:37:10.020]  Listen.
[03:37:10.020 --> 03:37:19.700]  I want to compare difficulties, but we have a little sense, Jill and I, what it's like
[03:37:19.700 --> 03:37:23.060]  to lose a home years ago.
[03:37:23.060 --> 03:37:29.140]  Now 15 years ago, I was in Washington doing meet the press lay on and it was a sunny
[03:37:29.140 --> 03:37:34.780]  Sunday and lightning struck at home on a little lake.
[03:37:34.780 --> 03:37:41.100]  This outside of our home, not a lake, a big pond and hit a wire and came up underneath
[03:37:41.100 --> 03:37:46.620]  our home into the heating ducks, air conditioning duck.
[03:37:46.620 --> 03:37:58.500]  Make a long story short, almost lost my wife, my 67 Corvette and my cat walking aside,
[03:37:58.500 --> 03:37:59.500]  all kidding.
[03:37:59.500 --> 03:38:00.500]  All right.
[03:38:00.500 --> 03:38:01.500]  Get them off.
[03:38:01.500 --> 03:38:03.700]  All kidding aside, you see what I'm saying?
[03:38:03.700 --> 03:38:07.820]  Like things have gone beyond, like I said, opening up the show, not Republican, Democrat.
[03:38:07.820 --> 03:38:13.700]  This is, this is like you either join the cult and not only do you die, you either
[03:38:13.700 --> 03:38:19.580]  join the cult or you die as we laugh at you and your children incinerating and
[03:38:19.580 --> 03:38:21.660]  we piss all over their graves.
[03:38:21.660 --> 03:38:22.660]  And you know what?
[03:38:22.660 --> 03:38:28.340]  Here's $700 to help you and your desperate poor peasant family, you know, nevermind
[03:38:28.340 --> 03:38:31.180]  give us that $700 back.
[03:38:31.180 --> 03:38:32.380]  That's going to Ukraine.
[03:38:32.380 --> 03:38:39.460]  That's going to Ukraine because Ukraine matters because Putin is destroying everything.
[03:38:39.460 --> 03:38:40.920]  I caught a cold today.
[03:38:40.920 --> 03:38:42.660]  It was Putin's fault.
[03:38:42.660 --> 03:38:46.140]  Oh, I got rear ended on my way to work.
[03:38:46.140 --> 03:38:50.320]  It was Putin's fault.
[03:38:50.320 --> 03:38:52.860]  Everything that happens to me that is bad is Putin.
[03:38:52.860 --> 03:38:56.260]  Guys, Putin is responsible for everything.
[03:38:56.260 --> 03:39:02.120]  Don't you understand Putin is the reason why there's evil in the world is the origin
[03:39:02.120 --> 03:39:03.120]  of sin.
[03:39:03.120 --> 03:39:04.120]  It's Putin.
[03:39:04.120 --> 03:39:05.480]  Everything bad happening all around me.
[03:39:05.480 --> 03:39:07.480]  It's Putin.
[03:39:07.480 --> 03:39:08.480]  Donald Trump.
[03:39:08.480 --> 03:39:09.480]  Putin's fault.
[03:39:09.480 --> 03:39:10.480]  Putin.
[03:39:10.480 --> 03:39:13.760]  How do we even get a Putin?
[03:39:13.760 --> 03:39:15.720]  That's even Putin's fault.
[03:39:15.720 --> 03:39:18.640]  It just, you know, it just never ends.
[03:39:18.640 --> 03:39:22.120]  You know, it's like, oh my gosh, I got beat up today.
[03:39:22.120 --> 03:39:23.560]  That was Putin's fault.
[03:39:23.560 --> 03:39:26.160]  Oh, dog took a crap on my carpet.
[03:39:26.160 --> 03:39:27.160]  That was Putin's fault.
[03:39:27.160 --> 03:39:28.800]  Putin and fight Putin.
[03:39:28.800 --> 03:39:30.200]  He influenced him too.
[03:39:30.200 --> 03:39:31.660]  Oh my God.
[03:39:31.660 --> 03:39:32.980]  We need Joe Biden.
[03:39:32.980 --> 03:39:39.500]  We need Joe Biden and Vladimir Zalutsky to save the day, guys.
[03:39:39.500 --> 03:39:43.140]  You know, the sad part, the sad part is, is that this is what these people roll out.
[03:39:43.140 --> 03:39:46.520]  You know, I think it was, what's the date today, guys?
[03:39:46.520 --> 03:39:48.240]  I'm all messed up on my dates.
[03:39:48.240 --> 03:39:49.500]  Today is the 25th.
[03:39:49.500 --> 03:39:53.500]  I think tomorrow they, I don't know if you guys saw this room tomorrow.
[03:39:53.500 --> 03:39:56.140]  They're literally on August 26th.
[03:39:56.140 --> 03:40:00.940]  If they didn't cancel it by now, they were still going forward with some like Ukraine
[03:40:00.980 --> 03:40:04.020]  awareness day in Honolulu in Hawaii.
[03:40:04.020 --> 03:40:08.140]  Could you believe like, wow, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[03:40:08.140 --> 03:40:09.500]  We got dead children.
[03:40:09.500 --> 03:40:11.460]  The community's incinerated.
[03:40:11.460 --> 03:40:15.100]  The government's getting exposed for leading people into the flames,
[03:40:15.100 --> 03:40:17.140]  not warning anybody.
[03:40:17.140 --> 03:40:20.740]  And then the people come out, reporters come out questioning that hack mayor.
[03:40:20.740 --> 03:40:21.940]  Oh my gosh.
[03:40:21.940 --> 03:40:26.380]  Talk about, oh, dude, that guy, that mayor is evil straight up.
[03:40:26.380 --> 03:40:29.740]  Like you got reporters, citizens saying, what about the children?
[03:40:29.780 --> 03:40:31.900]  Do you even know about the incinerated children?
[03:40:31.900 --> 03:40:33.260]  Why didn't anybody get warned?
[03:40:33.260 --> 03:40:35.540]  The people are saying if they heard a siren,
[03:40:35.540 --> 03:40:39.060]  then maybe they would have had a chance to survive and others would have too.
[03:40:40.340 --> 03:40:42.180]  And what's the response?
[03:40:42.180 --> 03:40:43.340]  Hey, shut down, man.
[03:40:43.340 --> 03:40:44.220]  Shut down.
[03:40:44.220 --> 03:40:45.580]  Shut down, all right?
[03:40:45.580 --> 03:40:47.540]  You wait your turn, okay?
[03:40:47.540 --> 03:40:50.060]  This is Maui, this is my city, like a mafia.
[03:40:50.060 --> 03:40:51.060]  Like shut up, man.
[03:40:51.060 --> 03:40:51.940]  You want to wait your turn?
[03:40:51.940 --> 03:40:53.940]  We could shut this whole thing down right now.
[03:40:53.940 --> 03:40:55.420]  We could shut it down right now.
[03:40:55.420 --> 03:40:59.220]  It's all these woke diversity hires, always, always with the woke diversity.
[03:40:59.220 --> 03:41:02.020]  These people are gonna get you killed, dude, okay?
[03:41:02.020 --> 03:41:05.860]  These woke diversity hires that are all the way in the White House
[03:41:05.860 --> 03:41:09.780]  with Kamala Harris installed there, she's gonna get you killed.
[03:41:09.780 --> 03:41:15.740]  Okay, look at the DA, look at all the riggers in Georgia.
[03:41:15.740 --> 03:41:18.340]  We gotta jail all these riggers, guys.
[03:41:18.340 --> 03:41:20.980]  All the riggers going after Trump.
[03:41:20.980 --> 03:41:23.180]  Those riggers, we gotta catch them.
[03:41:23.180 --> 03:41:25.500]  We gotta catch those pesky riggers.
[03:41:25.500 --> 03:41:27.340]  If we don't catch those riggers,
[03:41:27.340 --> 03:41:29.900]  we're not gonna have a free and fair election.
[03:41:29.900 --> 03:41:31.540]  Ha ha, I got you.
[03:41:33.460 --> 03:41:37.420]  Oh, you know what's funny about that, actually?
[03:41:37.420 --> 03:41:39.140]  It was CNN, okay?
[03:41:39.140 --> 03:41:41.060]  Because Trump came out and said,
[03:41:41.060 --> 03:41:43.620]  you know, they don't go after the riggers.
[03:41:43.620 --> 03:41:48.260]  The woke white women the next day went on CNN and said,
[03:41:48.260 --> 03:41:51.060]  could you believe what Trump said on True Social?
[03:41:51.060 --> 03:41:54.460]  He said, riggers, we know what he means.
[03:41:54.460 --> 03:41:56.980]  He's talking about black people.
[03:41:57.980 --> 03:42:01.500]  Dude, CNN defined rigger, dude.
[03:42:01.500 --> 03:42:03.860]  CNN did that.
[03:42:03.860 --> 03:42:04.980]  I didn't do that.
[03:42:04.980 --> 03:42:06.300]  Trump didn't do that.
[03:42:06.300 --> 03:42:08.660]  It was CNN.
[03:42:10.220 --> 03:42:11.540]  Based CNN.
[03:42:11.540 --> 03:42:13.740]  If we can even say that.
[03:42:13.740 --> 03:42:16.660]  Do those two, does that word and three letters
[03:42:16.660 --> 03:42:17.940]  even exist together?
[03:42:17.940 --> 03:42:20.380]  Like almost makes you wanna throw up, huh?
[03:42:20.380 --> 03:42:23.820]  Oh, I just, I love, I just so love
[03:42:23.820 --> 03:42:26.460]  that it was the woke white women on CNN
[03:42:26.460 --> 03:42:30.100]  that defined the word riggers as black people.
[03:42:30.100 --> 03:42:33.100]  Not Trump's true social policy!
[03:42:33.100 --> 03:42:34.860]  You just can't make that up, dude!
[03:42:34.860 --> 03:42:36.460]  You just can't make that up!
[03:42:36.460 --> 03:42:37.620]  Get the riggers!
[03:42:37.620 --> 03:42:38.660]  Get the riggers!
[03:42:38.660 --> 03:42:39.820]  We gotta find them!
[03:42:39.820 --> 03:42:41.460]  We need a free and fair election!
[03:42:41.460 --> 03:42:44.620]  If we don't, the riggers are dismantling society!
[03:42:44.620 --> 03:42:45.940]  The riggers are the ones
[03:42:45.940 --> 03:42:47.500]  that are gonna collapse the West!
[03:42:47.500 --> 03:42:48.860]  It's the riggers!

[03:42:56.500 --> 03:42:58.940]  I've studied how the globalists,
[03:42:58.940 --> 03:43:01.500]  how the mad scientists are controlling us,
[03:43:01.500 --> 03:43:04.620]  and they're doing it by keeping us undernourished.
[03:43:04.620 --> 03:43:06.300]  You can eat all the food you want in the world,
[03:43:06.300 --> 03:43:09.940]  but if you don't have the essential vitamins and minerals
[03:43:09.940 --> 03:43:11.740]  in an organic, absorbable form,
[03:43:11.740 --> 03:43:14.060]  if you don't have the key elements like iodine,
[03:43:14.060 --> 03:43:16.780]  you are literally like someone in a paddle boat
[03:43:16.780 --> 03:43:19.700]  without ores, without paddles.

[03:47:34.580 --> 03:47:35.420]  Let's go.
[03:47:41.940 --> 03:47:43.260]  All about rigas.
[03:47:46.020 --> 03:47:46.860]  Let's go.
[03:47:48.980 --> 03:47:51.100]  You know what, maybe we should change it.
[03:47:52.660 --> 03:47:54.340]  Hey guys, what do you guys think, Crew,
[03:47:54.340 --> 03:47:56.500]  should we change it from rigas to trigas?
[03:47:58.620 --> 03:48:00.540]  Mix Trump with rigas?
[03:48:05.220 --> 03:48:08.620]  Oh, there you go, oh, there it is.
[03:48:08.620 --> 03:48:11.180]  There it is, it's like Pierce Brosnan Trump.
[03:48:13.900 --> 03:48:18.060]  All my triggers worldwide, all my triggers, triggers.
[03:48:18.060 --> 03:48:20.100]  Anyways, you guys want to roast Mike Pence?
[03:48:20.100 --> 03:48:21.340]  I really want to talk about this guy,
[03:48:21.340 --> 03:48:22.300]  you want to know why?
[03:48:22.300 --> 03:48:26.380]  He's so gay, like he's just, Mike Pence is so gay.
[03:48:26.380 --> 03:48:27.860]  You want to know something?
[03:48:27.860 --> 03:48:29.900]  All right, this is my opinion, all right?
[03:48:29.900 --> 03:48:33.060]  Let me say this, there used to be all these articles
[03:48:33.060 --> 03:48:35.940]  written about Mike Pence when he was VP,
[03:48:35.940 --> 03:48:38.420]  when he was, you know, Judas pretending to be
[03:48:38.420 --> 03:48:41.980]  by Jesus' side, you know, Judas pretending to be
[03:48:41.980 --> 03:48:44.820]  by Trump's side, pretending to be a faithful VP
[03:48:44.820 --> 03:48:46.860]  because he loves America.
[03:48:46.860 --> 03:48:48.220]  There used to be all these articles
[03:48:48.220 --> 03:48:50.620]  about Pence being a closeted homosexual
[03:48:50.620 --> 03:48:53.500]  and, you know, I used to sit and think to myself,
[03:48:53.500 --> 03:48:54.940]  man, that's probably a lie.
[03:48:54.940 --> 03:48:58.300]  But now I'm like, you know what, they might be right.
[03:48:58.300 --> 03:49:02.340]  That's my opinion, this guy, dude, I have never,
[03:49:02.340 --> 03:49:06.220]  I have never seen someone get such a hard-on
[03:49:06.220 --> 03:49:08.060]  over another country before.
[03:49:08.060 --> 03:49:10.540]  Like, dude, when you watch this guy during the debate,
[03:49:10.540 --> 03:49:13.840]  anytime you watch Mike Pence, okay,
[03:49:13.840 --> 03:49:17.380]  when you watch Mike Pence talking about Ukraine,
[03:49:17.380 --> 03:49:21.060]  it's like his eyes just go off into La La Land.
[03:49:21.060 --> 03:49:23.780]  He just starts staring off into space.
[03:49:23.780 --> 03:49:26.500]  It's like sexual euphoria in his mind.
[03:49:26.500 --> 03:49:29.140]  Like all the endorphins in his mind are just like
[03:49:29.140 --> 03:49:31.660]  total just, you know, orgasm.
[03:49:31.660 --> 03:49:33.340]  He's just thinking about Ukraine.
[03:49:33.340 --> 03:49:36.260]  I've never seen that before, never.
[03:49:36.260 --> 03:49:38.660]  Like, you know, I love the United States.
[03:49:38.660 --> 03:49:40.140]  I love my country.
[03:49:40.140 --> 03:49:43.220]  But Mike Pence, this guy, when he talks about Ukraine,
[03:49:43.220 --> 03:49:47.180]  I mean, it's so crazy, look at the debate.
[03:49:47.180 --> 03:49:51.420]  This guy spends minutes, minutes, just praising Ukraine.
[03:49:51.420 --> 03:49:53.420]  Ukraine, that's like, dude,
[03:49:53.420 --> 03:49:55.340]  do you even live in America, bro?
[03:49:55.340 --> 03:49:58.060]  But we know, he's a rhino, he's a deep state,
[03:49:58.060 --> 03:50:00.340]  you know, plant, that's why he, you know,
[03:50:00.340 --> 03:50:02.380]  which, by the way, if you guys watched
[03:50:03.740 --> 03:50:06.020]  the absolutely astronomically,
[03:50:06.020 --> 03:50:07.520]  which, by the way, I have this article right here,
[03:50:07.520 --> 03:50:09.660]  total blowout, Fox News debate ratings
[03:50:09.660 --> 03:50:11.420]  are downright pathetic,
[03:50:11.420 --> 03:50:13.540]  as President Trump's Tucker Carlson interview
[03:50:13.540 --> 03:50:17.200]  soars to over 240 million views.
[03:50:17.200 --> 03:50:21.780]  It's probably even more right now, I guarantee you,
[03:50:21.780 --> 03:50:23.320]  and it's climbing and climbing and climbing.
[03:50:23.320 --> 03:50:26.300]  I'm interested to see if it gets to half a million,
[03:50:26.300 --> 03:50:27.500]  half a billion, excuse me.
[03:50:27.500 --> 03:50:29.140]  That would be wild, that would be insane,
[03:50:29.140 --> 03:50:31.220]  but look at that, that's, you see what this is?
[03:50:31.220 --> 03:50:34.460]  That's the, this is the mainstream media
[03:50:34.460 --> 03:50:37.140]  getting destroyed by the independent media.
[03:50:37.140 --> 03:50:38.060]  You see what this is?
[03:50:38.060 --> 03:50:41.140]  This is the establishment getting destroyed by the outsider.
[03:50:41.140 --> 03:50:43.300]  That's what that is, that's what that means.
[03:50:43.300 --> 03:50:45.840]  Every single one of us need to understand that.
[03:50:45.840 --> 03:50:48.220]  But the point is this, the point is this, you know,
[03:50:48.220 --> 03:50:49.100]  with Mike, it's just,
[03:50:49.100 --> 03:50:51.060]  you take a look at the Trump interview,
[03:50:51.060 --> 03:50:53.340]  and I thought it was interesting
[03:50:53.340 --> 03:50:56.420]  when Trump told the story of what was going on,
[03:50:56.420 --> 03:50:59.420]  pre-J6, leading up to Judas turning his back
[03:50:59.420 --> 03:51:00.900]  on Trump in America,
[03:51:00.900 --> 03:51:03.700]  receiving that little silver coin handshake
[03:51:03.700 --> 03:51:05.940]  when he sealed the deal for the election, right?
[03:51:05.940 --> 03:51:08.160]  I did my constitutional duty.
[03:51:08.160 --> 03:51:09.260]  It was crazy how Trump said,
[03:51:09.260 --> 03:51:11.580]  well, you know, some of the lawyers said he can't,
[03:51:11.580 --> 03:51:13.500]  some of the lawyers said he can.
[03:51:13.500 --> 03:51:15.220]  And I said, well, I think you can, Mike.
[03:51:15.220 --> 03:51:17.060]  I'm not asking you to overturn the election.
[03:51:17.060 --> 03:51:18.920]  I'm asking you to send them back
[03:51:18.920 --> 03:51:21.380]  so that the state can make sure and secure
[03:51:21.380 --> 03:51:22.660]  that they're all legitimate
[03:51:22.660 --> 03:51:24.940]  because there's some serious issues
[03:51:24.940 --> 03:51:26.760]  in these particular states.
[03:51:26.760 --> 03:51:28.620]  And the narrative is,
[03:51:28.620 --> 03:51:30.860]  well, Trump was saying overthrow the election.
[03:51:30.860 --> 03:51:32.620]  No, Trump made it clear on the interview,
[03:51:32.620 --> 03:51:34.460]  I was telling him to send them back
[03:51:34.460 --> 03:51:36.940]  so they could vet to make sure that this is authentic.
[03:51:36.940 --> 03:51:38.060]  What is wrong with that?
[03:51:38.060 --> 03:51:39.660]  That's why Trump said in the interview,
[03:51:39.660 --> 03:51:41.500]  well, that's why I was trying to make the argument
[03:51:41.500 --> 03:51:45.520]  so if this guy gets like millions of fake votes,
[03:51:45.520 --> 03:51:48.780]  he just has to send it on through, right?
[03:51:48.780 --> 03:51:49.900]  And then Trump goes on to say,
[03:51:49.900 --> 03:51:54.320]  well, Pence was told by his lawyers
[03:51:54.360 --> 03:51:56.080]  that that's not constitutional
[03:51:56.080 --> 03:51:58.800]  and a vice president can't do that.
[03:51:58.800 --> 03:52:01.220]  But the moment they sealed the deal
[03:52:01.220 --> 03:52:03.640]  for the 2020 election post-J6,
[03:52:03.640 --> 03:52:06.020]  the moment they sealed that deal,
[03:52:06.020 --> 03:52:07.760]  what did the Uniparty do?
[03:52:07.760 --> 03:52:09.260]  Allegedly, according to Trump,
[03:52:09.260 --> 03:52:10.960]  the Uniparty gets together
[03:52:10.960 --> 03:52:13.960]  and they shut down the ability of the vice president
[03:52:13.960 --> 03:52:15.360]  to ever do such a thing.
[03:52:15.360 --> 03:52:16.700]  Wow.
[03:52:17.880 --> 03:52:18.800]  Good job.
[03:52:18.800 --> 03:52:21.060]  Great job, Deep State.
[03:52:21.060 --> 03:52:22.880]  This guy, Mike Pence, is really something, man.
[03:52:22.880 --> 03:52:24.260]  This guy's a traitor.
[03:52:24.260 --> 03:52:25.580]  I feel really uncomfortable with him
[03:52:25.580 --> 03:52:26.500]  on the screen behind me.
[03:52:26.500 --> 03:52:27.860]  Like, look at this guy.
[03:52:27.860 --> 03:52:28.700]  You know?
[03:52:28.700 --> 03:52:32.340]  He's probably talking about Ukraine in this photo.
[03:52:32.340 --> 03:52:33.700]  I guarantee you,
[03:52:33.700 --> 03:52:35.980]  he's probably talking about Ukraine in this photo.
[03:52:35.980 --> 03:52:39.420]  This guy, you know, I guarantee you, his wife,
[03:52:39.420 --> 03:52:41.260]  you know, they probably have, you know,
[03:52:41.260 --> 03:52:43.820]  not the best, you know, intimate relationship.
[03:52:43.820 --> 03:52:47.020]  I guarantee you, his wife has probably had the result,
[03:52:47.020 --> 03:52:49.220]  you know, just to get her husband, you know,
[03:52:49.220 --> 03:52:50.860]  interested in her, you know,
[03:52:50.860 --> 03:52:52.320]  just to turn him on a bit.
[03:52:52.320 --> 03:52:55.640]  You know, what does Mrs. Pence have to result to?
[03:52:55.640 --> 03:52:57.760]  Not wearing lingerie, you know,
[03:52:57.760 --> 03:53:00.600]  not tickling his favorite little spot, you know,
[03:53:00.600 --> 03:53:03.720]  not trying to seduce him in a marriage.
[03:53:03.720 --> 03:53:05.600]  Now, what does she probably have to do?
[03:53:05.600 --> 03:53:07.760]  She probably just has to start talking about Ukraine,
[03:53:07.760 --> 03:53:09.840]  you know, just talk about Ukraine.
[03:53:09.840 --> 03:53:12.040]  You'll get Mike Pence all turned on.
[03:53:12.040 --> 03:53:13.600]  Just, you see what I'm saying?
[03:53:13.600 --> 03:53:15.280]  Just talk about Ukraine.
[03:53:15.280 --> 03:53:17.920]  And that's probably how she gets him all turned on.
[03:53:17.920 --> 03:53:19.980]  Cause that guy, I'm telling you, man,
[03:53:19.980 --> 03:53:21.660]  that whole debate was cringe.
[03:53:22.520 --> 03:53:25.880]  DeSantis, total bobblehead, but Pence, man.
[03:53:25.880 --> 03:53:27.440]  I can't get over this dude, man.
[03:53:27.440 --> 03:53:31.040]  It is so wild to see someone just turn their back
[03:53:31.040 --> 03:53:33.640]  on a country and then stand on a stage
[03:53:33.640 --> 03:53:35.760]  and sit there and tell you,
[03:53:35.760 --> 03:53:38.660]  well, you know, I'm actually the right choice.
[03:53:38.660 --> 03:53:40.560]  That's when you know someone is deep state.
[03:53:40.560 --> 03:53:41.920]  You understand that?
[03:53:41.920 --> 03:53:43.600]  Okay, and then you got DeSantis up there
[03:53:43.600 --> 03:53:44.800]  trying to look around the classroom
[03:53:44.800 --> 03:53:46.840]  and make sure he's making the right decision.
[03:53:46.840 --> 03:53:47.800]  It's just total cringe.
[03:53:47.800 --> 03:53:50.600]  And who was the guy all the way on the end of the stage?
[03:53:50.600 --> 03:53:52.200]  Not Aza, the other guy.
[03:53:53.040 --> 03:53:57.040]  It was like some kind of multiverse Governor Gavin Newsom.
[03:53:57.040 --> 03:53:58.720]  Do you guys know who I'm talking about?
[03:53:58.720 --> 03:54:01.160]  There was like some random dude all the way to the left.
[03:54:01.160 --> 03:54:03.760]  Not the right, not this way.
[03:54:03.760 --> 03:54:06.600]  This guy right here, who was this guy?
[03:54:06.600 --> 03:54:07.960]  Who was that?
[03:54:07.960 --> 03:54:09.600]  Like some multiverse Governor Gavin Newsom.
[03:54:09.600 --> 03:54:10.800]  I don't know, you know,
[03:54:10.800 --> 03:54:12.440]  I don't know who these, where these people come from,
[03:54:12.440 --> 03:54:17.320]  but it is abundantly clear, America, where the choice is.
[03:54:17.320 --> 03:54:18.280]  It is abundantly clear.
[03:54:18.280 --> 03:54:20.440]  Oh gosh, don't even get me started on this guy.
[03:54:20.440 --> 03:54:22.800]  Jabba the Hutt 2024, you guys.
[03:54:22.800 --> 03:54:27.200]  Jabba the Hutt 2024, free jelly donuts for all,
[03:54:27.200 --> 03:54:29.200]  free jelly donuts for all.
[03:54:29.200 --> 03:54:33.320]  Everybody gets high cholesterol, higher cholesterol,
[03:54:33.320 --> 03:54:37.760]  higher taxes, higher calorie intake.
[03:54:38.640 --> 03:54:39.480]  Nikki Haley.
[03:54:39.480 --> 03:54:43.000]  Did you see Nikki Haley's comment in the debate?
[03:54:43.000 --> 03:54:44.520]  I guess we're just gonna roast all these people
[03:54:44.520 --> 03:54:46.080]  right now, you know, why not?
[03:54:46.080 --> 03:54:48.200]  Nikki Haley's comment in the debate.
[03:54:48.200 --> 03:54:50.160]  She's like, oh, if you really want, you know,
[03:54:50.840 --> 03:54:52.440]  ask a man to do something, but if you want it to get done,
[03:54:52.440 --> 03:54:53.840]  you know, you ask a woman.
[03:54:53.840 --> 03:54:57.480]  Oh, I know all the guys felt that.
[03:54:57.480 --> 03:54:59.600]  Just like, oh, the cringe.
[03:54:59.600 --> 03:55:01.480]  Okay, boss lady.
[03:55:01.480 --> 03:55:03.920]  Oh, what a feminine, that feminism is so crazy.
[03:55:03.920 --> 03:55:05.760]  Is it feminism cringe?
[03:55:05.760 --> 03:55:09.240]  It's like, you know, when you're watching that guy,
[03:55:09.240 --> 03:55:13.680]  the multiverse Gavin Newsom, how did he get up there?
[03:55:13.680 --> 03:55:17.400]  Anyways, dude, like the Nikki Haley feminist cringe
[03:55:17.400 --> 03:55:19.800]  is like the equivalent to watching footage.
[03:55:20.400 --> 03:55:22.040]  You know like that crazy footage of like skateboarders
[03:55:22.040 --> 03:55:26.920]  or you know, dirt bike riders, like extreme sports dudes,
[03:55:26.920 --> 03:55:29.160]  like just flying off of ramps and you know,
[03:55:29.160 --> 03:55:32.240]  skating and breaking femurs, breaking their wrists
[03:55:32.240 --> 03:55:35.920]  and you see it and you're like, oh, that's what I feel.
[03:55:35.920 --> 03:55:39.040]  That's what I feel when I hear feminists speak.
[03:55:39.040 --> 03:55:41.880]  It's like, woman, shut up.
[03:55:41.880 --> 03:55:44.960]  Get in the kitchen, make a sandwich or something.
[03:55:44.960 --> 03:55:47.160]  Just stop talking, ugh.
[03:55:47.160 --> 03:55:48.800]  And then that one, did you see when Nikki Haley
[03:55:48.800 --> 03:55:51.360]  was like, we need to communicate to people
[03:55:51.360 --> 03:55:53.120]  that if a woman gets abortion,
[03:55:53.120 --> 03:55:55.120]  we're not gonna throw her in prison.
[03:55:55.120 --> 03:55:56.280]  We're not gonna throw, it's like,
[03:55:56.280 --> 03:55:58.840]  no, we should throw her in prison.
[03:55:58.840 --> 03:56:01.200]  If abortion is murder, then these women
[03:56:01.200 --> 03:56:03.200]  should be prosecuted.
[03:56:03.200 --> 03:56:06.080]  If it's murder, then let's be based.
[03:56:06.080 --> 03:56:07.920]  You wanna be based, America?
[03:56:07.920 --> 03:56:10.680]  Then let's put murderers in prison.
[03:56:12.360 --> 03:56:13.880]  Drew, that's a little too far right for me.
[03:56:13.880 --> 03:56:15.120]  Okay, then you're not pro-life
[03:56:15.120 --> 03:56:18.000]  because if you were someone that murders an infant,
[03:56:19.320 --> 03:56:22.560]  ugh, it's simple stuff, it's simple stuff.
[03:56:22.560 --> 03:56:25.000]  But it's just cringe, you know, it's super cringe.
[03:56:25.000 --> 03:56:26.880]  We have to make sure we show people,
[03:56:26.880 --> 03:56:28.320]  we have to reach across the aisle
[03:56:28.320 --> 03:56:30.120]  to make sure that people understand
[03:56:30.120 --> 03:56:31.840]  that we're just as liberal as they are.
[03:56:31.840 --> 03:56:33.920]  Oh yeah, that's great, wow.
[03:56:33.920 --> 03:56:37.640]  Yeah, let's just sit at the table with the pedophiles
[03:56:37.640 --> 03:56:40.880]  and figure out how we can find some common ground.
[03:56:40.880 --> 03:56:43.120]  Let's sit at the table with the communists
[03:56:43.120 --> 03:56:44.920]  that wanna destroy you and your family
[03:56:44.920 --> 03:56:48.760]  and weaponize the FBI and weaponize the DOJ and the CIA
[03:56:48.760 --> 03:56:51.720]  to not only go after Trump or anyone in his political orbit,
[03:56:51.720 --> 03:56:53.280]  but you and your family.
[03:56:53.280 --> 03:56:56.280]  Yeah, let's sit at the table and let's hold hands.
[03:56:59.400 --> 03:57:02.520]  You know, in theory, that's how things are supposed to be.
[03:57:02.520 --> 03:57:06.360]  Ugh, this woman, this woman belongs in the kitchen, dude.
[03:57:06.360 --> 03:57:11.360]  Jeez, ugh, the cringe, the cringe is so unbearable.
[03:57:12.000 --> 03:57:13.920]  I can't tolerate it.
[03:57:13.920 --> 03:57:17.560]  I genuinely hated that moment when she said that.
[03:57:17.600 --> 03:57:18.440]  I hated it.
[03:57:18.440 --> 03:57:19.280]  You wanna know why?
[03:57:19.280 --> 03:57:22.520]  Not because it's like you're trying to talk down to a man.
[03:57:22.520 --> 03:57:24.120]  You know, you don't know your role in society
[03:57:24.120 --> 03:57:25.920]  as a daughter of Eve, you know,
[03:57:25.920 --> 03:57:29.040]  because I'm not some beta cucked out son of Adam,
[03:57:29.040 --> 03:57:31.920]  but that you're trying to like assert your dominance
[03:57:31.920 --> 03:57:33.960]  and think that I actually believe
[03:57:33.960 --> 03:57:35.560]  that's how things are supposed to be.
[03:57:35.560 --> 03:57:37.520]  Yeah, no thanks, cuck.
[03:57:37.520 --> 03:57:39.240]  Anyways, I'm your host, Drew Hernandez,
[03:57:39.240 --> 03:57:40.600]  guest host, Drew Hernandez.
[03:57:40.600 --> 03:57:42.520]  This is the fourth hour of the Alex Jones Show,
[03:57:42.520 --> 03:57:43.360]  The War Room.
[03:57:43.360 --> 03:57:45.800]  Owen Troyer starts in just a couple minutes.
[03:57:45.800 --> 03:57:48.520]  A lot of listeners have complained in the last two years
[03:57:48.520 --> 03:57:50.360]  that our amazing high quality coffee
[03:57:50.360 --> 03:57:51.520]  has not been available.
[03:57:51.520 --> 03:57:53.760]  And that's because the prices went up too high
[03:57:53.760 --> 03:57:56.320]  for the raw beans and the quality had gone down some.
[03:57:56.320 --> 03:57:58.040]  I turned down so many companies
[03:57:58.040 --> 03:57:59.400]  that wanted to work with us,
[03:57:59.400 --> 03:58:02.600]  but now we have brought back the coffee
[03:58:02.600 --> 03:58:06.240]  and it's even better from a national supplier
[03:58:06.240 --> 03:58:08.960]  that's veteran owned and veteran operated.
[03:58:08.960 --> 03:58:12.200]  It's powered by the company, Minuteman Coffee.
[03:58:12.200 --> 03:58:15.560]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is the best tasting,
[03:58:15.560 --> 03:58:20.560]  best smelling, strongest coffee that I have ever drank.
[03:58:20.680 --> 03:58:22.560]  It is game-changing.
[03:58:22.560 --> 03:58:24.840]  All you gotta do is buy a bag of it and try it.
[03:58:24.840 --> 03:58:25.880]  I know you're gonna be hooked,
[03:58:25.880 --> 03:58:28.200]  which will then fund our Operation A360 win.

[03:58:32.280 --> 03:58:33.240]  That's the strongest.
[03:58:33.240 --> 03:58:36.000]  The amazing medium roast wig of America.
[03:58:36.000 --> 03:58:39.600]  And finally the best tasting dark roast tip of the spear,

[03:58:45.520 --> 03:58:48.200]  In the early 1900s, certain companies
[03:58:48.200 --> 03:58:51.720]  were off-gassing highly toxic fluoride gases
[03:58:51.720 --> 03:58:52.960]  into the atmosphere.
[03:58:52.960 --> 03:58:55.720]  The surrounding communities began to get sick.
[03:58:55.720 --> 03:58:59.120]  Laws were enacted to compel these corporations
[03:58:59.120 --> 03:59:00.720]  to install scrubbers,
[03:59:00.720 --> 03:59:04.040]  to convert these gases into fluorescence acid.
[03:59:04.040 --> 03:59:06.360]  Still highly toxic, but containable.
[03:59:06.360 --> 03:59:09.880]  Now these companies had a stockpile of this poison
[03:59:09.880 --> 03:59:12.400]  and there was no affordable way to dispose of it.
[03:59:12.400 --> 03:59:14.960]  Lucky for them, one of their major stockholders
[03:59:15.000 --> 03:59:17.400]  was also the secretary of the treasury,
[03:59:17.400 --> 03:59:19.920]  who was responsible for the public health service
[03:59:19.920 --> 03:59:20.880]  at the time.
[03:59:20.880 --> 03:59:25.040]  And by 1950, the US government began buying this toxic,
[03:59:25.040 --> 03:59:27.520]  untreated industrial waste product
[03:59:27.520 --> 03:59:29.760]  and dumping it into our drinking water.
[03:59:29.760 --> 03:59:32.160]  Reputable studies show that it's causing
[03:59:32.160 --> 03:59:34.800]  various cancers and other disease.
[03:59:34.800 --> 03:59:36.760]  With the Alexa Peer Pro,
[03:59:36.760 --> 03:59:38.720]  you can have clean drinking water
[03:59:38.720 --> 03:59:41.080]  and a remedy to this madness.
