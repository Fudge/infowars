[00:00.000 --> 00:17.920]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want to stop
[00:17.920 --> 00:24.480]  tyranny well so does he live from the info wars dot-com studios it's Alex
[00:24.480 --> 00:44.040]  Jones here we are ladies and gentlemen another Friday is already a punks and
[00:44.040 --> 00:51.240]  it's amazing but 2016 is already long in the tooth as we hurdle towards the
[00:51.240 --> 00:59.960]  election was it 65 days out right now 66 days t-minus 66 days because we count
[00:59.960 --> 01:07.920]  election day it's 66 but 65 depending on how you look at it wow look at the
[01:07.920 --> 01:11.700]  economic numbers that are up on drugs report calm released by the federal
[01:11.700 --> 01:17.760]  government and remember these are cooked numbers August jobs 151,000
[01:17.760 --> 01:22.640]  unemployment rate unchanged at 4.9
[01:23.080 --> 01:27.040]  biggest gains are in bars and restaurants yes low-paying service
[01:27.040 --> 01:31.320]  jobs army of men out of work the big corporations admit that they have
[01:31.320 --> 01:38.480]  actuary everything out to phase men out by 2035 from almost all professions and
[01:38.480 --> 01:41.920]  of course robots are going to be phasing women out as well but you need to
[01:41.920 --> 01:45.880]  first teach everyone that men are worthless and remove them from all
[01:45.880 --> 01:51.400]  leadership roles so the women will be alone when they face the technocracy
[01:51.400 --> 01:56.880]  while the men are all wire headed up in VR with their girlfriends and fantasy
[01:56.880 --> 02:07.960]  land playing World of Warcraft and Call of Duty 10.0 that's the world we're
[02:07.960 --> 02:11.900]  hurdling into their admitted plan but who cares about admitted plans for
[02:11.900 --> 02:16.520]  global government and technocracies it's just easier to make fun of those
[02:16.520 --> 02:21.520]  actually warning the public we've got big lights out as the hurricane steams
[02:21.520 --> 02:27.760]  towards and slams in to the eastern seaboard we'll be breaking all of that
[02:27.760 --> 02:30.400]  down you know I'm not really been covering this NFL football player even
[02:30.400 --> 02:35.640]  though it's interesting because it's such a complex issue starting with CNN
[02:35.640 --> 02:40.480]  taking out a context basically what he said and then him making truthful
[02:40.480 --> 02:42.880]  statements about Hiller that he's a criminal but moronic statements about
[02:42.880 --> 02:52.320]  Trump and then wearing white pig police socks this is just a confused person
[02:52.320 --> 02:55.080]  that's why some of us that he says is true some of us that he says is wrong
[02:55.080 --> 02:59.720]  he's trying to make a stand before the New York Times takes us out of context
[02:59.720 --> 03:04.680]  or media matters I'm not saying he's a hero I'm not saying that I support what
[03:04.680 --> 03:09.120]  he's doing but the guy has dumb courage I mean to sit there in a football stadium
[03:09.120 --> 03:14.940]  everybody booze you on one knee during the national anthem during the Star
[03:14.940 --> 03:21.320]  Spangled Banner it takes some big old wave hoes small brain but a lot of guts
[03:21.320 --> 03:29.200]  and I don't mean literally as a small brain but he I don't think he's
[03:29.200 --> 03:32.480]  consciously out there trying to hurt people he really thinks he's doing the
[03:32.480 --> 03:36.080]  right thing and this is a horrible evil country because George Soros's brain
[03:36.080 --> 03:40.240]  washing has gotten to the poor guy that makes what is it over a hundred
[03:40.240 --> 03:44.520]  million dollars or something ridiculous oh my gosh you're so oppressed and the
[03:44.520 --> 03:51.200]  evil Marine oppressing you he probably makes $40,000 a year it gets old when
[03:51.200 --> 03:55.720]  you actually have the real statistics so it's a landmine strewn field it's
[03:55.720 --> 03:59.520]  complex I've tried to look at it and quite friend with world economic meltdown
[03:59.520 --> 04:02.960]  happening with Germany telling its citizens prepare for a super big
[04:02.960 --> 04:12.640]  emergency but won't say what a week ago today to have Gary Johnson who I'll be
[04:12.640 --> 04:16.920]  honest with you I I haven't really paid attention to him I know he's there as a
[04:16.920 --> 04:24.800]  spoiler for Trump I know I don't like him I've been around him in person and
[04:24.800 --> 04:28.040]  I've known Johnson for ten years I mean he's been in studio at least six seven
[04:28.040 --> 04:39.320]  times okay I mean I was in a film with him it's just I actually did some digging
[04:39.320 --> 04:43.480]  into in the last few days and boy it's worse than I thought he is a democratic
[04:43.480 --> 04:47.800]  party operative no doubt about it with big globalist money going to him and he
[04:47.800 --> 04:54.800]  is pro TPP we know that but his VP is anti-gun he wants them all banned I mean
[04:54.800 --> 05:00.880]  the and Johnson is now anti-gun this guy's bad news Joe Biggs here with
[05:00.880 --> 05:05.720]  info wars.com Colin Kaepernick says the pigs on his socks were only meant to
[05:05.720 --> 05:10.360]  represent row cops Colin Kaepernick made more news Thursday when photos of him
[05:10.360 --> 05:14.320]  wearing socks with pictures of pigs dressed like police officers began
[05:14.320 --> 05:19.240]  attracting attention this is the same guy who refused to stand up during the
[05:19.240 --> 05:23.360]  national anthem the San Francisco 49ers quarterback addressed the situation
[05:23.360 --> 05:27.160]  with an Instagram post later in the morning I wore these socks in the past
[05:27.160 --> 05:30.440]  because the row cops that are allowed to hold positions in police departments
[05:30.440 --> 05:34.160]  not only put the community in danger but also put the cops that have the right
[05:34.160 --> 05:38.240]  intentions in danger by creating an environment of tension and mistrust he
[05:38.240 --> 05:41.320]  added that he wore the socks before he started sitting down during the
[05:41.320 --> 05:45.400]  national anthem prior to the 49ers preseason games this year there is
[05:45.400 --> 05:48.800]  police brutality the quarterback said people of color have been targeted by
[05:48.800 --> 05:52.440]  police so that's a large part of it and their government officials they are
[05:52.440 --> 05:55.920]  put in place by the government so that's something that this country has to

[08:07.600 --> 08:14.360]  Leading a frontal assault on the lives of the New World Order it's Alex Jones on
[08:14.360 --> 08:18.520]  the GCN radio network.
[08:18.520 --> 08:46.920]  It's Friday the second day of September two thousand and sixty and we are 66 days
[08:46.920 --> 08:53.480]  out from probably the most important election in United States history if not
[08:53.480 --> 09:01.120]  in world history not since the founding of this Republic and the kickoff of the
[09:01.120 --> 09:11.200]  war that made that possible in 1775 have the stakes been as big or as clear for
[09:11.200 --> 09:18.240]  the future of humanity that's why the battle against the British Empire was
[09:18.240 --> 09:24.680]  called the shot heard around the world the commencement of that because no one
[09:24.680 --> 09:29.840]  had beaten the British up into that point around the planet they'd beaten the
[09:29.840 --> 09:35.840]  Spanish they'd beaten the French they'd beaten the Prussians they had beaten the
[09:35.840 --> 09:42.560]  Russians they had beaten the Portuguese the Dutch everyone over and over and over
[09:42.560 --> 09:53.440]  and over and over again because they never gave up but they lost here because
[09:53.440 --> 09:57.520]  they came to realization that the population was never going to submit
[09:57.520 --> 10:04.880]  was never going to give in was never going to back down it was three percent
[10:04.880 --> 10:11.520]  that started the war when the British came to confiscate the firearms it was
[10:11.520 --> 10:17.160]  five percent that fought the war another five percent that supported them and by
[10:17.160 --> 10:21.440]  the end it was around twenty percent historians agree both British French and
[10:21.440 --> 10:30.640]  colonial twenty percent at the end in the beginning a patriot is a scarce man
[10:30.640 --> 10:35.600]  hated feared and scorned but in time when his cause succeeds the timid join him
[10:35.600 --> 10:41.760]  because then it costs nothing to be a patriot we are seeing media disinformation
[10:41.760 --> 10:51.520]  media twisting lies against Donald Trump the Trump family Matt drudge myself
[10:51.520 --> 10:59.720]  in force it is a badge of honor to be lied about to have them spin to have
[10:59.720 --> 11:03.920]  them disassemble to have them take what I say out of context to have them
[11:03.920 --> 11:08.520]  misrepresent over and over again because these are discredited
[11:08.520 --> 11:13.640]  organizations and groups but the mainstream media the corporate media is
[11:13.640 --> 11:18.920]  still able to have some power when they all combined forces and put out giant
[11:18.920 --> 11:26.960]  hoaxes in unison they are still able to push certain lies successfully to the
[11:26.960 --> 11:37.320]  public like Donald Trump's deeply racist or vaccines are safe and effective that
[11:37.320 --> 11:42.360]  is they're able to push it to 50% or more the public record numbers in the
[11:42.360 --> 11:46.760]  Associated Press yesterday of Americans and folks in Europe are not taking
[11:46.760 --> 11:51.040]  vaccines in fact the more higher educated you are the less vaccines you
[11:51.040 --> 11:56.360]  take wonder why maybe you know how to read a drug insert maybe you have a
[11:56.360 --> 12:00.160]  memory maybe you remember how many people have died from vaccines how many
[12:00.160 --> 12:03.680]  people have been maimed by vaccines this is just an example of what we're dealing
[12:03.680 --> 12:09.520]  with I mean how many people know the Zika virus was patented in 1954 by the
[12:09.520 --> 12:13.280]  Rockefeller Foundation how many people know that Bill and Melinda Gates are on
[12:13.280 --> 12:17.920]  record weaponizing it and releasing mosquitoes that are supposedly meant to
[12:17.920 --> 12:22.320]  eradicate it that then mutate and spread it oh and of course it attacks your
[12:22.320 --> 12:26.640]  fertility just magically that's what the Rockefellers and their front people are
[12:26.640 --> 12:31.960]  obsessed with the Rockefellers we started the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute and
[12:31.960 --> 12:37.560]  they first secured it in 1947 the original Zika the weaponized version the
[12:37.560 --> 12:42.920]  first was in 1954 we've got mainstream news articles on screen for folks if you'd
[12:42.920 --> 12:49.040]  like to read about that the reason I mentioned it is trapped Florida mosquitoes
[12:49.040 --> 12:57.560]  found to contain Zika virus ah despite the fact that they're spraying
[12:57.560 --> 13:03.600]  untold tonnage of very deadly pesticide but doesn't matter because the mainstream
[13:03.600 --> 13:09.440]  media said it was quote safe and effective just like vaccines are they
[13:09.440 --> 13:14.480]  said a hatchet upside the head is also safe and effective safe close quote
[13:14.480 --> 13:19.640]  Zika pesticide nukes millions of bees John Rappaport investigative journalist
[13:19.640 --> 13:23.760]  will be joining us next hour to break that down and a lot more and it ties
[13:23.760 --> 13:30.520]  together with the mosquitoes spreading all over that have the Zika well that's
[13:30.520 --> 13:35.000]  okay though Pope Francis says you should just pay carbon taxes and carbon
[13:35.000 --> 13:43.120]  indulgences and and then you'll be forgiven the sin of carbon that you
[13:43.120 --> 13:47.640]  exhale that plants breathe and don't worry about all the GMO all the genetic
[13:47.640 --> 13:50.440]  engineering the chimeras the abominations the baby parts being sold
[13:50.440 --> 13:58.640]  pontiff who wants world government Pope Francis global warming is a sin but
[13:58.640 --> 14:05.680]  there's ways to atone don't worry your little heads about that as the national
[14:05.680 --> 14:09.960]  debt hits nineteen point five trillion it's now being announced and as we look
[14:09.960 --> 14:18.880]  at the economy August jobs 151,000 unemployment rate is unchanged the
[14:18.880 --> 14:25.080]  feds announced biggest gains are in bars and restaurants and their service
[14:25.080 --> 14:29.320]  industries and of course wow obama can brag about hundreds of thousands of
[14:29.320 --> 14:34.560]  jobs and so bomb a care went in because 35 million people roughly that's the
[14:34.560 --> 14:38.760]  number I saw months ago and I'm told it's growing 35 million people had to go
[14:38.760 --> 14:42.680]  get a second or third job because they got cut to part-time so that employers
[14:42.680 --> 14:52.320]  wouldn't have to pay for Obamacare because they can't afford it most
[14:52.320 --> 14:56.000]  businesses out there in this country might have 10% profitability if they're
[14:56.000 --> 15:02.320]  doing decent how do you suddenly pay for a bunch of health care you don't you
[15:02.320 --> 15:06.520]  let people offer you come to part-time and I've told the store many times when
[15:06.520 --> 15:11.120]  it started hitting two years ago three years ago now Obamacare I would swim
[15:11.120 --> 15:15.000]  usually almost every day at Barton Springs when it was warm enough to this
[15:15.000 --> 15:18.680]  big natural pool it's got like 20 lifeguards any one time it's so big one
[15:18.680 --> 15:24.400]  of the biggest natural pools in the world spring fed and I noticed a lot of
[15:24.400 --> 15:28.480]  the lifeguards who were mad at me for like a year or so and kind of make
[15:28.480 --> 15:31.960]  snide remarks and I just ignored it I don't care and then they all came up
[15:31.960 --> 15:38.440]  basically all and apologized including the managers and said we thought you
[15:38.440 --> 15:41.800]  were lying we thought Obamacare was free the city told us we'd be getting free
[15:41.800 --> 15:47.840]  health care and then as soon as it went in we all got cut to part-time and then
[15:47.840 --> 15:51.720]  I had him bring me bringing me bottled water and would you like to have lunch
[15:51.720 --> 15:55.080]  with us we're gonna have lunch up at the at the main well tell us about more
[15:55.080 --> 15:58.360]  about Obamacare and why why they actually believe they were gonna get
[15:58.360 --> 16:02.960]  something free and the city Democrat run live to him of course and that's just
[16:02.960 --> 16:08.560]  a microcosm people thought I was just up here on air going there's death
[16:08.560 --> 16:12.080]  panels and it doubles and triples prices and it's written by foreign insurance
[16:12.080 --> 16:22.960]  companies we could read the bill we could read the bill we were able to read
[16:22.960 --> 16:35.360]  the bill that's it that's all that's all that was going on but they knew the
[16:35.360 --> 16:38.440]  public wasn't gonna go read the bill they could just say Alex Jones is a liar
[16:38.440 --> 16:44.440]  Ron Paul's a liar senator Paul's a liar Ted Cruz is a liar that time he's telling
[16:44.440 --> 16:50.360]  truth all the time sure turned on us but he was doing a great job Matt drudges a
[16:50.360 --> 16:55.080]  liar Alex Jones is deeply racist is why it isn't like Obamacare that's a quote
[16:55.080 --> 17:00.520]  from MSNBC just like Gruber said thank God they're so dumb thank God they don't
[17:00.520 --> 17:06.800]  pay attention thank God they have no attention spans and it goes on and on
[17:06.800 --> 17:11.120]  and on and let me get into all the news that's coming up here today and a bunch
[17:11.120 --> 17:15.120]  of special reports I want to get into we have John Rappaport joining us we have
[17:15.120 --> 17:19.560]  Steve Pachennick on the inner workings inside the government and what the
[17:19.560 --> 17:24.040]  military's current posture is with the globalist coup d'etat is taking place
[17:24.040 --> 17:27.360]  because let me tell you the military knows foreign multinationals are now
[17:27.360 --> 17:31.200]  conquering this country Obama claims his authority to launch wars come from the
[17:31.200 --> 17:35.760]  UN and NATO we've seen all this in Congress and now they're putting the
[17:35.760 --> 17:39.320]  police under UN control they're attempting to a strong cities they're
[17:39.320 --> 17:44.680]  announcing our elections to be overseen by the EU slash UN original
[17:44.680 --> 17:51.460]  corporation that founded all that I say EU UN so folks know the group I'm
[17:51.460 --> 17:57.080]  talking about the OECD after World War two reorganize the planet set the
[17:57.080 --> 18:03.240]  dollar is the world currency the whole Bretton Woods situation the CIA was set

[18:10.120 --> 18:14.520]  quote run our election and they're quote federalizing the election and I have
[18:14.520 --> 18:20.640]  big guests on that are smart people on national TV and I say to him like yes

[18:36.960 --> 18:41.400]  Washington Post and he was watching it on Skype the creator of Dilbert smart
[18:41.400 --> 18:45.880]  guy and he was like what really that he was freaking out when when the interview
[18:45.880 --> 18:49.200]  ended he was like shaking his head but you can see he was typing and looking
[18:49.200 --> 18:53.240]  stuff up and going what because I say that he's typing oh yeah they're

[19:23.280 --> 19:28.440]  month ago responding to me and a Trump I was pushing him into that trap I said
[19:28.440 --> 19:34.840]  on air it was a trap and then their arrogance blinds them and then they
[19:34.840 --> 19:38.160]  stepped right into it admitting they're federalizing it they were already
[19:38.160 --> 19:45.080]  sending all these UN and Interpol people in to run the election before let's see
[19:45.080 --> 19:48.080]  if I told somebody they were doing it they wouldn't care I had to predict they

[24:31.640 --> 24:36.240]  he said it would be over a year ago he said if you are a really really bad
[24:36.240 --> 24:39.920]  person and you've committed crimes you're going to be deported from this
[24:39.920 --> 24:45.040]  country back to your country of origin like every other country in the world
[24:45.040 --> 24:51.880]  does and let you in if you're a criminal and then if you're here illegally but
[24:51.880 --> 24:56.600]  haven't committed other crimes then there's going to be a process for you to
[24:56.600 --> 25:01.440]  be able to come back into the country and be vetted and already basically have a
[25:01.440 --> 25:06.520]  job waiting that a citizen wouldn't be able to take and there's plenty of those
[25:06.520 --> 25:11.760]  slots available because the cliche is true there are a lot of lazy people in
[25:11.760 --> 25:17.280]  this country of every race color and creed the wealth has done that to us but
[25:17.280 --> 25:20.440]  there are also a lot of criminals pouring out of the third world yes on
[25:20.440 --> 25:25.120]  average a lot of folks from the third world especially Latin America do you
[25:25.120 --> 25:29.920]  want to work hard do you want to have a future and are actually pro family and
[25:29.920 --> 25:36.120]  stereotypically hard-working and smart they've just never been under even a
[25:36.120 --> 25:39.480]  quasi-free system they've been under colonial systems even after the
[25:39.480 --> 25:44.520]  colonialism ended where the elites didn't want wealth in the general public
[25:44.520 --> 25:47.560]  people are going wait a minute that's all you ever talk about Alex is how the
[25:47.560 --> 25:51.240]  elites don't want wealth in general population and how globalism is this new
[25:51.240 --> 25:56.440]  system of austerity yes in the UN's own words in the 1996 biological diversity
[25:56.440 --> 26:01.480]  assessment policy review and implementation papers that I have copies
[26:01.480 --> 26:07.880]  of in my film road to tyranny it says we're gonna make people poor permanently
[26:07.880 --> 26:12.160]  so we can then social engineer them and absolutely mold them the way we want
[26:12.160 --> 26:16.760]  that's called slavery it's a fancy term for slavery and they go on to say that
[26:16.760 --> 26:22.720]  the government can only have the guns because civilian ownership of firearms
[26:22.720 --> 26:28.520]  threatens the legitimate power monopoly of the state Unidire July 7th 2000 that
[26:28.520 --> 26:32.560]  was in the official treaty version of the small arms ban at that time the
[26:32.560 --> 26:36.120]  little people owning firearms threatens the legitimate power monopoly of the
[26:36.120 --> 26:40.360]  state the actual quote is civilian ownership of firearms threatens the
[26:40.360 --> 26:48.920]  legitimate power monopoly of the state what is a power monopoly a tyranny a
[26:48.920 --> 26:54.160]  dictatorship and you go to Latin American countries almost every country it
[26:54.160 --> 26:58.680]  is near impossible to get a firearm you've got to jump through literally
[26:58.680 --> 27:02.960]  hundreds of hoops less than 1% of the population in countries like Mexico
[27:02.960 --> 27:08.760]  their places have guns that's legal guns and that's because there's an
[27:08.760 --> 27:14.120]  attitude of only the establishment having the weapons and finally it causes
[27:14.120 --> 27:21.400]  the states to fail like Venezuela like Mexico right now Venezuela is a zombie
[27:21.400 --> 27:25.600]  war level crisis I mean it is hundreds and hundreds of murders every few days
[27:25.600 --> 27:31.200]  rapes carnage burning zoo animals being eaten dogs and cats six months ago
[27:31.200 --> 27:34.800]  we're almost disappeared off the streets there aren't pigeons anymore it's being
[27:34.800 --> 27:37.400]  reported in cities people are eating them with you know killing them with
[27:37.400 --> 27:43.640]  slingshots and folks when the ground forage is gone cannibalism will kick in
[27:43.640 --> 27:51.320]  next and mark my words cannibalism will start ensuing in Venezuela soon in
[27:51.320 --> 27:57.520]  fact analysts are saying that complete breakdown total failure this is in a
[27:57.520 --> 28:05.520]  country with fish and food just all over the place but oh they catch you trying
[28:05.520 --> 28:09.160]  to fish even in your own creek here comes a little communist they say that's
[28:09.160 --> 28:16.520]  mine mine so why should you even catch fish it is descending in to bedlam what
[28:16.520 --> 28:22.320]  was the second wealthiest country just 50 years ago in Latin America was
[28:22.320 --> 28:27.000]  Venezuela Argentina was richer than the United States on average now they are
[28:27.000 --> 28:36.680]  failed hell pits and this is being done by design make no mistake economic
[28:36.680 --> 28:40.880]  warfare a long-term program when I come back though I'm gonna get into report
[28:40.880 --> 28:48.200]  British Muslim males 170 times more likely to be part of a sex grooming gang
[28:48.200 --> 28:54.640]  the non-Muslims because it's in the Sunni cultures where these guys are the
[28:54.640 --> 28:58.840]  more radical forms of it but that's what's dominating now and you add
[28:58.840 --> 29:03.200]  welfare state and European socialism to this form of Islam it creates a
[29:03.200 --> 29:10.760]  mutated strain of basically gangbanger meets Islam meets pimp and I mean look
[29:10.760 --> 29:13.480]  at the gang signs look at the statements look at the photos look at the music
[29:13.480 --> 29:17.160]  little look at the videos there's all this weird Islamic rap now that is the
[29:17.160 --> 29:22.680]  most just drivelish garbage you've ever heard because they believe your daughters
[29:22.680 --> 29:29.280]  belong to them in a jihad because their imams say in characteristic stereotypical
[29:29.280 --> 29:33.560]  blocks no hi rocks ring rule sounds like we play the clips like Klingon and then
[29:33.560 --> 29:38.120]  the translation is they are weak they are falling go to Germany take our women
[29:38.120 --> 29:43.880]  they are ours I'd slave them for Allah they are no goo we will rule them look at
[29:43.880 --> 29:47.840]  the Gary Johnson first though he's a gun grabber it's worse than I thought stay

[30:23.480 --> 30:28.200]  still this is leading to ever more severe droughts floods fires and extreme
[30:28.200 --> 30:32.280]  weather events climate change is also contributing to the heart rendering
[30:32.280 --> 30:36.720]  refugee crisis and the reason the radical Islamists run around beheading
[30:36.720 --> 30:40.880]  gays and cutting women's heads off and mutilating their genitalia damn that

[33:35.920 --> 33:42.080]  John Robbaport joins us with massive breaking news and analysis in the
[33:42.080 --> 33:45.920]  second hour Dr. Steve Pachining on what's happening inside the government
[33:45.920 --> 33:49.960]  the military the police the public waking up to the New World Order and the
[33:49.960 --> 33:54.640]  soft coup that took place about four years ago inside the United States where
[33:54.640 --> 33:59.040]  our own military at the top is not following the orders of Obama anymore
[33:59.040 --> 34:03.800]  when they believe it's unconstitutional and again that's not sedition that's
[34:03.800 --> 34:08.560]  not mutiny that's not in subordination because we have been hijacked by
[34:08.560 --> 34:13.520]  globalist and they admit in their own public councils they are eradicating
[34:13.520 --> 34:19.200]  our republic our checks and balances so the military is doing its duty and
[34:19.200 --> 34:25.720]  quite frankly would do more if the military believed the general public
[34:25.720 --> 34:32.680]  was ready for what needs to be done and everybody knows who pays attention to
[34:32.680 --> 34:37.040]  this broadcast we don't sit here with idle words we don't puff ourselves up we
[34:37.040 --> 34:42.520]  don't act big we don't talk you know talk about intrigued wow all the
[34:42.520 --> 34:48.400]  military is ready to stand up against the New World Order it's already happened
[34:48.760 --> 34:54.480]  this country is in an incredible state right now a lot of bad things are
[34:54.480 --> 34:56.680]  happening a lot of good things are happening I want to get into Gary
[34:56.680 --> 35:03.400]  Johnson because I do this all the time I missed the forest for the trees and I
[35:03.400 --> 35:07.800]  I'll be honest with you I've not been paying attention to Gary Johnson and I
[35:07.800 --> 35:15.480]  actually the last week did the research an hour or more a day on and I'm gonna
[35:15.480 --> 35:18.600]  have to put a special report together that will be the torpedo that destroys
[35:18.600 --> 35:24.040]  him if you decide to get the information out to people I'm gonna lay out some of
[35:24.040 --> 35:27.080]  it here today in just a moment but I mean if there's a lot of it and it's
[35:27.080 --> 35:34.200]  where he's getting his funding and 100% he is meant to scuttle things and
[35:34.200 --> 35:40.240]  steal votes from Donald J. Trump and the way the media has given him massive
[35:40.240 --> 35:47.600]  attention and pushing him out there he could actually legitimately lose this
[35:47.600 --> 35:51.000]  election for the American people and give it to Hillary and that is his
[35:51.000 --> 35:59.040]  sniveling job and he is a just unbelievable Benedict Arnold and I'm
[35:59.040 --> 36:03.040]  gonna explain why in just a moment but before you go any further ladies and

[38:50.160 --> 38:53.480]  Donald Trump has said I mean you people would rather buy something that costs
[38:53.480 --> 38:57.560]  $10 less from Honduras and that's fine because I don't mind if Hondurans get
[38:57.560 --> 39:01.680]  jobs actually you're building up some form of industry but I actually study
[39:01.680 --> 39:05.120]  where we get things from and I tell you stuff from China there people get
[39:05.120 --> 39:11.200]  almost no no benefit from it we have the entire made in America line the majority
[39:11.200 --> 39:14.800]  of our clothing is made in America it just generally cost $5-10 more because
[39:14.800 --> 39:21.840]  that's what it cost at info wars store dot-com or made in 1776.com I like to
[39:21.840 --> 39:25.920]  join us or die sure I think that's one of the best we've got it's not one of our
[39:25.920 --> 39:29.280]  best sellers was personally my favorite shirt to wear out you know I fight
[39:29.280 --> 39:31.880]  Hillary so much that I'll be honest with you I don't want to wear a Hillary
[39:31.880 --> 39:35.640]  president shirt out I don't want to when I'm out with friends and family they'll
[39:35.640 --> 39:39.920]  be you know at restaurants with Donald Trump koozies on their iced tea and
[39:39.920 --> 39:43.880]  Donald Trump hats and Donald Trump shirts and a few people are hissing at
[39:43.880 --> 39:47.720]  us and oh my god are people gonna spit in our food and you know what that was
[39:47.720 --> 39:51.080]  six months ago because I already paid my dues already fight this all the time I
[39:51.080 --> 39:53.960]  don't want to be reminded about Hillary Clinton when I'm not you know at dinner
[39:53.960 --> 39:58.080]  but you know what I realized that I'm proud of my family and proud of my
[39:58.080 --> 40:01.840]  friends because now they just are constantly wearing Donald Trump apparel
[40:01.840 --> 40:07.600]  and so am I I'm not wearing a Hillary for President shirt I'm you're wearing a
[40:07.600 --> 40:12.360]  Donald Trump shirt now my kids are they love it they're always I mean we just
[40:12.360 --> 40:16.000]  have to get in people's faces at this point and what I'm saying is I get not
[40:16.000 --> 40:20.440]  wanting to get in people's faces you've worked 40 50 hours you're taking care of
[40:20.440 --> 40:23.880]  business you just want to go to you know the hardware store and get some wood or
[40:23.880 --> 40:27.440]  whatever or you want to go to the pet store to buy some bird seed I get it
[40:27.440 --> 40:30.200]  but you know what we're gonna lose everything if we don't just get even
[40:30.200 --> 40:34.560]  more aggressive so I'm talking to the listeners out there who've never bought a
[40:34.560 --> 40:37.640]  Hillary for President shirt or never bought a Mola online base shirt or never
[40:37.640 --> 40:42.640]  bought an anti-socialism shirt or never supported info wars I get it I'm not
[40:42.640 --> 40:46.520]  saying you're supposed to but the bare minimum send out links of our shows the
[40:46.520 --> 40:52.080]  podcast videos articles information because nobody is fighting harder for
[40:52.080 --> 40:56.240]  you and listen I don't say that like I deserve it I want it I want to win I'm
[40:56.240 --> 40:59.480]  a hundred percent committed if you think going up against Hillary Clinton is a
[40:59.480 --> 41:02.680]  safe thing to do at this level
[41:03.440 --> 41:08.760]  jump you know jump off a cliff without a parachute and see how you feel this is
[41:08.760 --> 41:13.080]  the real deal what you're seeing with info wars is a real attack run on the
[41:13.080 --> 41:17.640]  globalist 20 plus years of the making and you see it we're hitting them we're
[41:17.640 --> 41:21.080]  blowing big bloody holes in their operation and they are firing back and
[41:21.080 --> 41:26.800]  they are hopping mad like fire ants and I'm not complaining I want this fight I
[41:26.800 --> 41:31.880]  was born for this fight I'm blessed for this fight I guess what side I stop
[41:31.880 --> 41:36.200]  breathing on air sometimes like a minute or two I guess I'm a you know deep-seed
[41:36.200 --> 41:43.680]  diver or something a skin diver I am so committed all I'm saying is God bless
[41:43.680 --> 41:46.000]  you I appreciate your support please support our local affiliates as well
[41:46.000 --> 41:50.000]  that is just as important as supporting us put a hundred bucks in the mail mail it
[41:50.000 --> 41:55.360]  to them become a sponsor support the sponsors hand out bumper stickers by
[41:55.360 --> 41:59.720]  the way by the way I I've just decided to do this we handed out 3,000 Hillary
[41:59.720 --> 42:02.920]  from prison bumper stickers that we put free in every order from info or store
[42:02.920 --> 42:06.480]  dot com and force life dot com it doesn't matter or you call my phone same deal
[42:06.480 --> 42:11.840]  we put three or four in any in each you guys call well attention over here right
[42:11.840 --> 42:14.600]  now I want to make sure I can do this right now these are really glossy nice
[42:14.600 --> 42:17.000]  bumper stickers I don't know what the turnaround is I'm on we only had like
[42:17.000 --> 42:21.920]  20,000 of them we've already been giving them out I want to say I need to ask the
[42:21.920 --> 42:26.480]  math on this I want to say I'm gonna put putting on the size of the package 10 to
[42:26.480 --> 42:33.200]  100 free bumper stickers in every I see more effective than t-shirts in every
[42:33.200 --> 42:37.180]  package and then of course you know what to do when the countries in an
[42:37.180 --> 42:41.400]  emergency overrun by foreign globalist don't dare post these stickers up in
[42:41.400 --> 42:45.880]  public because the locals might claim it's illegal it's not illegal to have
[42:45.880 --> 42:49.160]  foreign megabanks take you over me enslaving you so the French resistance
[42:49.160 --> 42:54.400]  would never just put a sticker up or paint V on a wall so whatever you do is
[42:54.400 --> 42:58.840]  don't post these and don't post info wars com stickers or some big
[42:58.840 --> 43:04.000]  sarcastic post them in legal awful areas okay I'm joking I'm having a little bit
[43:04.000 --> 43:08.520]  of fun the point is is that we need to take action the gloves are off I'm not
[43:08.520 --> 43:12.600]  saying you decline billboards at night and spray paint holy for prison on the
[43:12.600 --> 43:18.440]  side of them I'm just saying we're in a lot of deep crap here okay and it's time
[43:18.440 --> 43:23.400]  to really pull out all stops people we have George Soros and the Ford
[43:23.400 --> 43:27.880]  Foundation now have given a hundred million dollars I was reminded by that
[43:27.880 --> 43:31.680]  of the chairman of the Republican Party outreach program was here in studio with
[43:31.680 --> 43:35.940]  us yesterday and I went oh my gosh I forgot that two days ago the Ford
[43:35.940 --> 43:41.240]  Foundation the that's who runs the whole show 100 million to black lives
[43:41.240 --> 43:45.080]  matter and that is to make sure that the cops pull out of every black area in
[43:45.080 --> 43:48.520]  this country and the crime rate goes through the roof and to turn every city
[43:48.520 --> 43:54.440]  into Chicago black lives matter caches in with a hundred million from liberal
[43:54.440 --> 44:01.160]  foundations whoa Washington Times I mean that is huge people and last I checked
[44:01.160 --> 44:04.440]  they've already been given over a hundred million and I tell people you
[44:04.440 --> 44:09.040]  know Doros gave 35 million just to in Ferguson to stir stuff up people go oh
[44:09.040 --> 44:13.040]  yeah right conspiracy theorist I can pull up the Washington Post they don't
[44:13.040 --> 44:20.200]  care all right I'm stopping you know quite frankly police should be getting
[44:20.200 --> 44:22.760]  these bumper stickers for me and sticking them up everywhere you have got
[44:22.760 --> 44:27.040]  people funding a hundred million dollars to basically stir up a movement for
[44:27.040 --> 44:30.800]  destabilization and have the UN take over the police departments I mean that's
[44:30.800 --> 44:34.720]  the point we've gotten to here I'm sorry you're popping them I am here they're
[44:34.720 --> 44:41.600]  meant oh thank you yes you're right I have told Matt when I lose track and I'm
[44:41.600 --> 44:46.960]  not covering all the news I'm supposed to to stop me thank you man and we do all
[44:46.960 --> 44:49.760]  the preparation for the show and then usually 80% of it goes out the window but
[44:49.760 --> 44:54.720]  and we put an old article about 33 million it turned out to be 35 million
[44:54.720 --> 44:59.720]  in Ferguson let's get into Gary Johnson right now
[44:59.720 --> 45:09.720]  Gary Johnson is a spoiler Gary Johnson is a Democratic Party plant and
[45:09.720 --> 45:16.640]  operative who is getting corporate and multinational funding because they know
[45:16.640 --> 45:19.480]  that the Libertarian Party is predominantly paleo conservative and
[45:19.480 --> 45:22.960]  leans more towards the classical Republican Party and the populist
[45:22.960 --> 45:26.880]  movement that Trump is basically promoting Trump is basically pushing a
[45:26.880 --> 45:31.760]  form of populist libertarianism and Gary Johnson who supports the TPP that is
[45:31.760 --> 45:35.000]  the most undemocratic unlibertarian thing in the world a secret global
[45:35.000 --> 45:40.200]  treaty handing over our sovereignty to multinational corporations Gary Johnson
[45:40.200 --> 45:46.480]  is now a total corporatist Gary Johnson in a lengthy clip is on info wars.com
[45:46.480 --> 45:50.880]  well he'll play part of it as a time constraints won't even criticize Obama
[45:50.880 --> 45:55.040]  on executive orders in an interview he did with town hall who by the way did a
[45:55.040 --> 46:00.120]  great job I've known Gary Johnson for ten years and about three years ago he
[46:00.120 --> 46:06.520]  went from being boring and a little bit creepy when he come into studio to like
[46:06.520 --> 46:11.760]  addled not very well spoken and I got a really bad vibe from him and I said that
[46:11.760 --> 46:14.920]  guy's creepy I don't ever want him on the show again I mean I told them that a
[46:14.920 --> 46:17.600]  few years ago I said I don't like Gary Johnson that guy gives me the creeps
[46:17.600 --> 46:24.960]  very few people give me the creeps okay very few but when you're dealing with
[46:24.960 --> 46:32.160]  someone that has this cold controlling system I mean I'll be honest I pick up
[46:32.160 --> 46:37.320]  the psychopath vibe I'm not sociopath I pick up a psychopath vibe from Gary
[46:37.320 --> 46:41.480]  Johnson and I was already saying that a few years ago man that guy I'll tell you
[46:41.480 --> 46:49.200]  who else gives me that vibe I've talked about it before it's serious now let's
[46:49.200 --> 47:00.520]  get into the meat potatoes his running mate wants all firearms that have five
[47:00.520 --> 47:07.120]  rounds or more banned and and and spews the biggest coop BS I've ever heard in
[47:07.120 --> 47:10.840]  my life I'm gonna read from the article I kid Daniels yesterday that I want to
[47:10.840 --> 47:14.400]  re-tweet out right now at real Alex Jones and post back on Facebook and I
[47:14.400 --> 47:18.320]  want this to go viral and I'm gonna be filing a special report next week where
[47:18.320 --> 47:23.040]  I go through the funding of Johnson his background and who he really is okay but
[47:23.040 --> 47:29.320]  this guy is a piece of work okay this guy is getting so much media attention
[47:29.320 --> 47:34.600]  and support by the establishment media that worships Hillary worships him they
[47:34.600 --> 47:37.760]  ignore the Green Party and demonize her because she'd take from Hillary I mean
[47:37.760 --> 47:44.040]  you talk about obvious and sick and they are pushing so hard to take down Trump
[47:44.040 --> 47:48.760]  right now and they're giving him so much attention they might even throw a
[47:48.760 --> 47:51.200]  curveball or something put him in the debate this guy didn't need to be in the
[47:51.200 --> 47:57.400]  debate now because he's not a serious candidate in our a says libertarian VP
[47:57.400 --> 48:01.760]  candidate anti-gun and they've got the quotes libertarian party is running an
[48:01.760 --> 48:05.480]  anti-gun candidate for vice president the IRA is warned it turns out Johnson's
[48:05.480 --> 48:09.960]  becoming anti-gun as governor of Massachusetts William Weld supported
[48:09.960 --> 48:13.280]  various gun control schemes including a ban on semi-automatic firearms the
[48:13.280 --> 48:17.400]  honorary confirmed they have links to it unfortunately and despite being a
[48:17.400 --> 48:21.120]  libertarian candidate for vice president Weld continues his anti-gun ways I
[48:21.120 --> 48:25.880]  want to say this the libertarian party has been hijacked by the globalist of
[48:25.880 --> 48:30.920]  the Democrats and it I've been a libertarian for 25 years I have said
[48:30.920 --> 48:35.160]  vote for third parties when you've got too bad establishment candidates but
[48:35.160 --> 48:39.160]  this is so clear that the insurrection has come through the populist and the
[48:39.160 --> 48:43.440]  Tea Party that Ron Paul started and then we started they got hijacked but
[48:43.440 --> 48:46.880]  doesn't matter then it got hijacked back by us and has taken the Republican
[48:46.880 --> 48:49.960]  Party over and you've got the whole system coming in trying to block this
[48:49.960 --> 48:55.080]  now get ready for the big quote Weld recently confirmed his anti-gun stance
[48:55.080 --> 49:00.520]  and his ignorance on guns in general oh this guy's a total cook he sounds worse
[49:00.520 --> 49:05.120]  than Walter Mondale I mean this guy is a kook the five-shot now listen to this
[49:05.120 --> 49:12.000]  boob the five-shot rifle that's a standard military rifle what 1901 this
[49:12.000 --> 49:18.200]  guy's a real cook now listen to this bumbling fruitcake the five-shot rifle
[49:18.200 --> 49:22.840]  that's a standard military rifle the problem is if you attach a clip to it
[49:22.840 --> 49:27.920]  so it can fire more shells and if you remove the pin so that it becomes an
[49:27.920 --> 49:32.880]  automatic weapon now the pin hits the cap dumbass and detonates the powder and
[49:32.880 --> 49:38.400]  shoots the projectile down the tube free me from these people I mean oh some
[49:38.400 --> 49:45.320]  rich fop with bodyguards with this little nerd class president judge
[49:45.320 --> 49:50.800]  schmales governor Gary Johnson who leaves a trail of slime behind him I was
[49:50.800 --> 49:55.160]  like get him out of my office and I never say that I never want that person
[49:55.160 --> 50:01.320]  around me again it was horrible he just he was like going talking there
[50:01.320 --> 50:08.880]  wait a minute I was just like he was just showing me his true self the fix I'm
[50:08.880 --> 50:13.800]  an animal thinks he's better than me thinks he's God no you're not now now
[50:13.800 --> 50:18.120]  listen to this I'm gonna skip this break listen to this the five-shot rifle
[50:18.120 --> 50:23.480]  that's a standard military rifle I'm quoting this guy this is the VP the
[50:23.480 --> 50:29.280]  five-shot rifle that's a standard military rifle the problem is no it's not
[50:29.280 --> 50:34.200]  the standard military rifle the five-shot rifle it's a standard military
[50:34.200 --> 50:39.000]  rifle the problem is if you attach a clip to it so it can fire more shells and
[50:39.000 --> 50:43.520]  if you remove the pin so it becomes an automatic weapon no you remove the pin
[50:43.520 --> 50:50.400]  to make it worthless close quote I'm gonna read this again it's so epic
[50:50.400 --> 50:55.920]  well five-shot rifle that's a standard military rifle the problem is that if you
[50:55.920 --> 51:01.520]  attach a clip to it it's a magazine so it can I just can't read this quote
[51:01.520 --> 51:06.320]  not interrupting it's such BS excuse me I'm gonna try this time the five the
[51:06.320 --> 51:10.920]  five-star rifle that's a basic military rifle problem is if you attach a clip to
[51:10.920 --> 51:16.240]  it so it can fire more shells and if you remove the pin so that it becomes an
[51:16.240 --> 51:20.560]  automatic weapon well said during a revolt dot TV interview in August yeah
[51:20.560 --> 51:26.200]  can we get that clip please make an ad with this vote Gary Johnson for mental
[51:26.200 --> 51:34.880]  illness brain deadness disinformation idiocy moron behavior he says it fires
[51:34.880 --> 51:41.760]  shells to do it fires the round the bullet the projectile the sabo the
[51:41.760 --> 51:48.040]  sabo whatever it's shooting the grape the double-ock buck the bird shot
[51:48.040 --> 51:53.120]  whatever it's shooting down the tube is the projectile and I'm not even a gun
[51:53.120 --> 51:57.760]  expert but I guess I'm going to these people okay
[52:01.000 --> 52:07.320]  no the standard military rifle is what the 556 that converts down they got the
[52:07.320 --> 52:13.840]  223 and you've got the rounds that the Europeans use and I guess you got the
[52:13.840 --> 52:18.040]  308 however that converts I mean but this guy doesn't even know that it's
[52:18.040 --> 52:28.560]  it's that it's that there's a shell that shoots down the barrel and then it goes
[52:28.560 --> 52:39.080]  on he goes on to say and that's those are independent criminal offenses so he
[52:39.080 --> 52:42.960]  goes on to say that if you have a rifle that has over five rounds you're a
[52:42.960 --> 52:47.760]  criminal because it's a military rifle and that if you remove the pin you've
[52:47.760 --> 52:52.400]  made it a machine gun and and quote those are independent criminal offenses
[52:52.400 --> 52:57.360]  continuing the quote that's when they become essentially a weapon of mass
[52:57.360 --> 53:01.160]  destruction that's how the UN under the treaty wants to ban civilian ownership
[53:01.160 --> 53:07.960]  of firearms is with that quote this guy even uses UN terminology he also
[53:07.960 --> 53:12.640]  attacked AR owners the NRA revealed Weldon on to suggest that the interviewer
[53:12.640 --> 53:16.520]  that both handguns and AR-15s are a problem stating the problem with
[53:16.520 --> 53:21.600]  handguns is probably even worse than the problem they are 15s the latest
[53:21.600 --> 53:25.840]  episode reveals when pressed on firearms issues despite any assurances he's
[53:25.840 --> 53:29.720]  given voters Weld's political instincts are to abandon gun owners and embrace gun
[53:29.720 --> 53:36.560]  control Weld's partner at LP ticket Gary Johnson also holds in numerous hate
[53:36.560 --> 53:41.840]  libertarian views including support for the trans-specific partnership now we
[53:41.840 --> 53:45.600]  have a clip on the play here of him being triggered it's on info wars.com
[53:45.600 --> 53:52.240]  Gary Johnson triggered by the word illegal immigrant oh my gosh we're so
[53:52.240 --> 53:55.760]  mean Mexico calls you an illegal immigrant or illegal alien that's been
[53:55.760 --> 53:59.120]  the term in customs for hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of years and I
[53:59.120 --> 54:03.480]  went back to it in the Latin it means alien out of the country and it's
[54:03.480 --> 54:09.680]  translated into Spanish and I went and looked it up they were using that term in
[54:09.680 --> 54:15.880]  Spanish it translated 600 years ago at Spanish ports was basically translated
[54:15.880 --> 54:23.720]  in English a natural or an alien so they're saying it's bad for America to
[54:23.720 --> 54:29.320]  use this term and it actually comes from Spain
[54:29.320 --> 54:35.240]  but let's go to Gary Johnson here oh my gosh don't use those words this guy's
[54:35.240 --> 54:40.240]  like MSNBC has taken over the Libertarian Party it's like the Communist
[54:40.240 --> 54:43.840]  Youth Brigade's taken over he wants to hand all our trade all our jobs all our
[54:43.840 --> 54:48.840]  rules and regulations over to secret TPP and he's a sniveling idiot who can
[54:48.840 --> 54:55.960]  hardly talk let's go ahead and play the clip you have defended President Obama's
[54:55.960 --> 55:03.040]  executive amnesty action where he basically decided unilaterally that he
[55:03.040 --> 55:09.240]  was going to issue work visas to millions of adult illegal immigrants who
[55:09.240 --> 55:14.800]  are here in the country undocumented by the way if you use the term illegal
[55:14.800 --> 55:20.360]  immigrants that is very incendiary to pause back at a place elation here listen
[55:20.360 --> 55:29.960]  to the foppish arrogant sycophantic country club Atlantic anglophile
[55:29.960 --> 55:35.760]  pretenses of this guy I mean this guy really thinks he hung the moon he thinks
[55:35.760 --> 55:38.480]  he doesn't need any puppery in the bathroom when he bombs the Germans I
[55:38.480 --> 55:48.440]  mean this guy is a piece of work just no that's very insane hold on you're not
[55:48.440 --> 55:51.800]  going to use that language that's official border patrol language until
[55:51.800 --> 55:57.120]  Obama changed it and now Interpol and the FBI aren't allowed to say Muslim or
[55:57.120 --> 56:01.760]  Islamists when there's an attack because we said so too as well did you know we
[56:01.760 --> 56:06.980]  control reality and now we're saying the word mother and father on college in
[56:06.980 --> 56:11.120]  high school and middle school entrance exams is hurtful because some people
[56:11.120 --> 56:15.840]  don't have mommies and daddies you're not allowed to have one either hold on
[56:15.840 --> 56:22.080]  I'm Gary Johnson okay now let's let's all be lectured by going look how he
[56:22.080 --> 56:26.440]  looks at him like very you're in trouble like oh I was so smart when I said
[56:26.440 --> 56:30.760]  that's so incendiary here let me host the rest of the segment like Gary Johnson
[56:30.760 --> 56:34.640]  go ahead and roll in the country undocumented by the way if you use the
[56:34.640 --> 56:40.200]  term illegal immigrants that is very incendiary to our Hispanic population
[56:40.200 --> 56:45.480]  here in this country why is that it just is it just is just so that you know it
[56:45.480 --> 56:53.240]  just it's yeah I don't defend what I'm saying I it just is okay
[56:53.240 --> 56:57.880]  Obamacare is free alright nobody wants your guns I mean come on please I'm sorry
[56:57.880 --> 57:01.840]  let me get back in because that's really let's do the real Gary Johnson
[57:01.840 --> 57:05.440]  everybody I'm a little gremlins through and everyone feeding on the dumb
[57:05.440 --> 57:09.840]  population second pass here let's go back to his little act
[57:09.840 --> 57:15.280]  oh please continue with Gary Johnson you know just so that you know and you don't
[57:15.280 --> 57:20.240]  have to use that term but isn't the term accurate in the in the sense that they
[57:20.240 --> 57:24.000]  entered the country they immigrated to the country illegally so they are I'm
[57:24.000 --> 57:28.960]  not in came into this country because they couldn't get in legally and the
[57:28.960 --> 57:33.120]  jobs exist and you see the reason he's triggered the reason he's triggered is
[57:33.120 --> 57:36.520]  that's the real Gary Johnson I'm telling you when he was here during the
[57:36.520 --> 57:39.440]  breaks I'd be sitting there taking I see me and he'd be sitting in a smaller
[57:39.440 --> 57:43.640]  studio very intimate like five feet away going
[57:44.240 --> 57:47.560]  I'd be oh so how's it going yeah it's fine
[57:47.560 --> 57:56.360]  how's it going I was like whoa I've been around this guy I don't know 10-15 times
[57:56.360 --> 58:00.760]  before and he had like this little thing oh hang oh but when he left with his son
[58:00.760 --> 58:04.520]  the last time he was here that runs his campaign he was just like here let's watch
[58:04.520 --> 58:07.880]  the triggering right now the real Gary Johnson like the alien bursting out of
[58:07.880 --> 58:12.440]  the chest has come out here it is they came into this country because they
[58:12.440 --> 58:18.080]  couldn't get in legally and the jobs existed and you or I would have done
[58:18.080 --> 58:23.040]  the same thing and we're talking about now coming from New Mexico a population
[58:23.040 --> 58:28.760]  with 48% he cares about Hispanics yes that's why the mega banks won't open
[58:28.760 --> 58:32.560]  borders in TPP they don't want a permanent underclass to exploit they
[58:32.560 --> 58:38.680]  haven't helped the globalist keep Mexico down no he cares about Hispanic by the
[58:38.680 --> 58:43.560]  way my VP wants to ban all the guns and put you in prison and I don't mind
[58:43.560 --> 58:48.520]  Obama's executive orders totally triggered totally triggered you got to
[58:48.520 --> 58:52.040]  see the real moray eel right there it's not just our water we need to filter it's
[58:52.040 --> 58:55.200]  not just our food that needs to be cleaned it's the air we're breathing
[58:55.200 --> 58:59.680]  especially for our children the artificial particulates the chemicals is
[58:59.680 --> 59:04.520]  absolutely weighing down our immune systems the same team based right here
[59:04.520 --> 59:08.720]  in America that brought you the Alexa pure groundbreaking water filtration
[59:08.720 --> 59:13.320]  systems have now developed Alexa pure breeze whether it's your home or office
[59:13.320 --> 59:17.640]  you owe it to yourself your co-workers your family your children to the best
[59:17.640 --> 59:21.600]  job you can to purify your air the elite are masters at poisoning our
[59:21.600 --> 59:25.760]  environment while themselves doing things that mitigate or avoid most
[59:25.760 --> 59:30.600]  the toxic effects for themselves the general public hasn't the Alexa pure
[59:30.600 --> 59:34.000]  breeze would be a steal at three hundred four hundred five hundred dollars one of
[59:34.000 --> 59:38.280]  these systems can keep 800 square feet incredibly clean this is a system I'm
[59:38.280 --> 59:41.560]  personally putting in throughout my house replacing older more expensive
[59:41.560 --> 59:45.560]  filters that didn't do as good a job find out why this system is so
[59:45.560 --> 59:50.160]  revolutionary today and then fullwar store.com
[59:50.160 --> 59:57.200]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[59:57.200 --> 01:00:18.200]  resistance to tyrants is obedience to God it's alex jones
[01:00:19.720 --> 01:00:24.040]  all right we got well-enhanced from the runs the info wars warehouse and shipping
[01:00:24.040 --> 01:00:27.400]  operations I asked him to come over here earlier if you just joined us I had an
[01:00:27.400 --> 01:00:33.320]  idea forming in my head that we could put a whole bunch of free bumper stickers
[01:00:33.320 --> 01:00:36.320]  in every order already putting a couple in each order but you explained to me
[01:00:36.320 --> 01:00:40.960]  no that'll up people shipping cost so it's not really stickers at cost if we
[01:00:40.960 --> 01:00:43.720]  do that are free stickers so you have another idea you said we can sell them
[01:00:43.720 --> 01:00:47.200]  at cost but we're about to sell out of them anyways well the free ones we're
[01:00:47.200 --> 01:00:49.480]  putting in we're about to be running out so be a couple weeks till we get them
[01:00:49.480 --> 01:00:53.280]  we're 66 days out from the election well then I need to go with other
[01:00:53.280 --> 01:00:58.640]  distributors other suppliers I need to get I need to get $5 million for
[01:00:58.640 --> 01:01:02.040]  present stickers here in the next couple weeks and we even have to use a third
[01:01:02.040 --> 01:01:06.000]  party shipper that's fine but I want to figure out what the real cost is and I
[01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:10.920]  want to sell these at cost because I want to information warfare bomb all 50
[01:01:10.920 --> 01:01:13.560]  states with these but especially the battleground states I want to create a
[01:01:13.560 --> 01:01:17.280]  map of the battleground states and I want to call it operation Hillary for
[01:01:17.280 --> 01:01:21.440]  present 2016 I think that's great we'll get a man get them out to everybody
[01:01:21.440 --> 01:01:25.400]  everybody put them up everywhere any target maximum firepower I agree I
[01:01:25.400 --> 01:01:30.320]  think this is this is awesome what do you think of Gary Johnson you heard my
[01:01:30.320 --> 01:01:32.880]  rant about him I mean I look listen I don't usually let in people like this
[01:01:32.880 --> 01:01:37.720]  but it was always something about Gary Johnson and I mean I've had him in
[01:01:37.720 --> 01:01:41.920]  studio many times interviewed him many times and I just saw this evolution I
[01:01:41.920 --> 01:01:45.480]  always thought it was fake and really boring and dry but now I've really seen
[01:01:45.480 --> 01:01:48.840]  a nastiness behind the scenes and I'm telling you he's as fake as a $3 bill
[01:01:48.840 --> 01:01:54.560]  he has his VP wants to just basically ban five rounds and up put gun owners in
[01:01:54.560 --> 01:01:58.240]  prison he says the pen he says you remove the pen to turn guns into a
[01:01:58.240 --> 01:02:03.200]  machine gun oh no there's there's a lot more than that I you know Gary Johnson
[01:02:03.200 --> 01:02:06.800]  he's always kind of struck me as a snake in the grass I don't really ever thought
[01:02:06.800 --> 01:02:11.080]  he had much charisma which is not good for a leader and you see people all
[01:02:11.080 --> 01:02:14.880]  around Austin you know we're a libertarian city here and they're all
[01:02:14.880 --> 01:02:18.400]  about Gary they are they are smelling the glue they are huffing Gary Johnson and
[01:02:18.400 --> 01:02:21.520]  it's already happening a lot of people like oh we hate Trump you know he's not
[01:02:21.520 --> 01:02:24.040]  you know we want to go with a real libertarian and I'm just like oh my
[01:02:24.040 --> 01:02:28.280]  goodness we are in trouble he is an admitted spoiler and we're gonna come
[01:02:28.280 --> 01:02:31.040]  out with videos next week showing where he's getting his funding but look at
[01:02:31.040 --> 01:02:34.640]  mainstream media worshipping him I mean what does that tell you people the
[01:02:34.640 --> 01:02:39.160]  mainstream media works for the establishment once they're working for
[01:02:39.160 --> 01:02:42.760]  them I mean you can tell it's all just a big big plot I mean it's just how do
[01:02:42.760 --> 01:02:45.800]  people not know when they pull out all the stops against Trump he doesn't get
[01:02:45.800 --> 01:02:49.280]  any big corporate money the whole planet's demonizing him the communist
[01:02:49.280 --> 01:02:54.080]  Chinese leaders the the evil Saudi leaders the evil pope the you know
[01:02:54.080 --> 01:02:57.680]  evil evil evil hates him and then you guys claim your anti-establishment
[01:02:57.680 --> 01:03:02.240]  you're gonna go with Gary Johnson that they act like the gibbering stuttering
[01:03:02.240 --> 01:03:07.120]  moron is God when he comes on there and acts like he's a country club manager
[01:03:07.120 --> 01:03:10.960]  no absolutely I mean all of a sudden Gary Johnson's cool I guess that started
[01:03:10.960 --> 01:03:16.640]  recently whenever the establishment thinks that he can take away votes from
[01:03:16.640 --> 01:03:21.200]  Trump but now obviously Gary Johnson's cool in the mainstream media Gary Johnson
[01:03:21.200 --> 01:03:25.160]  say to you Gary Johnson they hope is the weapon that takes down Trump and
[01:03:25.160 --> 01:03:29.680]  destroys America I mean Gary Johnson is an anti-American weapon system I mean
[01:03:29.680 --> 01:03:33.600]  yes that's Gary Johnson is and that's why I'm so hateful because I mean this is
[01:03:33.600 --> 01:03:37.360]  the death of my country my children's future this is all a little snickering
[01:03:37.360 --> 01:03:43.360]  white shoe boy know-it-all snot-nose country club blue blood interloping piece
[01:03:43.360 --> 01:03:48.840]  of filth it's like activate the Gary Johnson effect right now I guess they're
[01:03:48.840 --> 01:03:51.440]  using it as another bullet in the chamber established he's triggering me
[01:03:51.440 --> 01:03:54.200]  right now let me tell you he was in there for an hour last year a couple years
[01:03:54.200 --> 01:03:59.200]  ago and he was literally going I was like wow I was like so what's going on
[01:03:59.200 --> 01:04:04.800]  here and that's what he does in that club I know I agree when he was here I
[01:04:04.800 --> 01:04:08.400]  did not get a good feeling for him there's just put it that way I'm pretty
[01:04:08.400 --> 01:04:11.280]  good at reading people by just talking to him or see him for a little bit and
[01:04:11.280 --> 01:04:14.880]  that did not come off have you ever seen anybody creeping around more like him
[01:04:14.880 --> 01:04:19.960]  hey he was sneaky he was a sneaky sneaky dude and that's for sure us Texas don't
[01:04:19.960 --> 01:04:24.880]  like little sneakies and he's like I'm from New Mexico I'm a side buster where

[01:04:28.840 --> 01:04:31.360]  this little directive around here I don't usually tell people what I want to
[01:04:31.360 --> 01:04:35.200]  report on but everybody needs to be looking into Gary Johnson I agree we
[01:04:35.200 --> 01:04:38.760]  have a magnifying glass I mean the fact that they're just rolling him out all
[01:04:38.760 --> 01:04:43.520]  of a sudden as some kind of like actual player I mean it's it's it's it ought to
[01:04:43.520 --> 01:04:46.480]  wake up a lot of people that they're really coming after Trump I mean first
[01:04:46.480 --> 01:04:51.240]  off everybody's attacking Trump I mean even if you don't agree with a lot of
[01:04:51.240 --> 01:04:54.400]  things Trump says I mean just the way you can see people at the Trump rally
[01:04:54.400 --> 01:05:00.480]  establishment is crapping their pants because Trump is a patriot we'll be back

[01:08:59.120 --> 01:09:02.000]  info wars.com right now I'm not going to get into his whole background as an
[01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:05.480]  investigative journalist wearing with some of the biggest newspapers and TV
[01:09:05.480 --> 01:09:09.440]  stations radio stations you name it in the country and his independent

[01:09:15.160 --> 01:09:20.200]  critic on many other things no more fake news.com before I go to him I want to
[01:09:20.200 --> 01:09:25.920]  just set the table because some stations join us in this hour we're gonna be
[01:09:25.920 --> 01:09:34.000]  looking some at Trump and his proposals on the deportation force and how the
[01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:39.440]  media is responding to that we're also going to be looking at former senator
[01:09:39.440 --> 01:09:44.680]  inquiry over Saudi involvement in 9-11 is not over we're also going to be
[01:09:44.680 --> 01:09:48.840]  looking at report British Muslim males a hundred to seventy times more likely to
[01:09:48.840 --> 01:09:52.440]  be part of sex grooming gang than non-Muslim but the police have been
[01:09:52.440 --> 01:09:57.240]  ordered to cover that fact up we've got jobs numbers that are cooked but still
[01:09:57.240 --> 01:10:00.320]  show their stagnant so that means they're actually negative what does that
[01:10:00.320 --> 01:10:04.800]  portend and what does John Redford think the article in fact we guys reprinted
[01:10:04.800 --> 01:10:10.160]  for me at info wars comm last week that linked to German newspapers major
[01:10:10.160 --> 01:10:13.920]  papers saying the government says get ready for some giant emergency get
[01:10:13.920 --> 01:10:17.240]  prepared and then Germans scooped all the food off the shelves and then you've
[01:10:17.240 --> 01:10:22.360]  got talk of the big German banks going belly up bigger than Lehman brothers I
[01:10:22.360 --> 01:10:29.360]  mean that's major German newspapers just like you know we have the BBC with the
[01:10:29.360 --> 01:10:34.040]  headline head of Royal Bank of Scotland shell everything you've got get rid of
[01:10:34.040 --> 01:10:37.520]  everything you know worst collapse ever coming and then they'll have some news
[01:10:37.520 --> 01:10:45.920]  article put out by media matters run by the White House saying Jones claims that
[01:10:45.920 --> 01:10:49.720]  Scotland's gonna collapse I mean that's what they do folks they misrepresent
[01:10:49.720 --> 01:10:54.680]  we're not the one saying this I hope this doesn't happen but it's getting
[01:10:54.680 --> 01:10:59.880]  frantic it's getting crazy it's getting wild then meanwhile if you just joined
[01:10:59.880 --> 01:11:05.200]  us I'm gonna play more of the clip this hour Gary Johnson I talked to the crew
[01:11:05.200 --> 01:11:09.080]  many of them been here a long time they've seen Gary Johnson repeatedly in
[01:11:09.080 --> 01:11:13.520]  the green room and up close for former governor in New Mexico running as a
[01:11:13.520 --> 01:11:18.560]  libertarian candidate who has a VP who is his anti-gun is Diane Feinstein or
[01:11:18.560 --> 01:11:24.480]  Barbara Boxer or Michael Moore I mean he says ban everything that is five shots
[01:11:24.480 --> 01:11:32.040]  and more that we have the weld clip we're gonna play here in a moment and then
[01:11:32.040 --> 01:11:36.840]  when Johnson was here I'd interviewed him in person many many times it was
[01:11:36.840 --> 01:11:40.760]  always something weird about it like he wasn't there when you talk to sociopaths
[01:11:40.760 --> 01:11:44.200]  or maybe even psychopaths but I thought oh he's just a quiet guy but then the
[01:11:44.200 --> 01:11:49.040]  last time he was here the crew described it they don't want to go on air because
[01:11:49.040 --> 01:11:51.800]  they're scared of him I don't go ahead and talk about it you'll talk about it
[01:11:51.800 --> 01:11:56.200]  yeah I mean he was going to kill me I mean he was this one during the
[01:11:56.200 --> 01:12:00.040]  browse like what are you doing and then when he left he was like a villain in
[01:12:00.040 --> 01:12:04.320]  the movie like I mean I've never seen a guest act like that but when he's on
[01:12:04.320 --> 01:12:09.600]  air he's like I'm a nice little guy I am Gary Johnson so go ahead CJ I'm not
[01:12:09.600 --> 01:12:12.560]  bullying you into talking about it but your description of him well I don't
[01:12:12.560 --> 01:12:16.760]  want to attack his character but when he was on air he was completely different
[01:12:16.760 --> 01:12:25.760]  the one was off it's like a switch flipped or something he he had a blank
[01:12:25.760 --> 01:12:31.280]  stare in his eyes when he would talk to him when he walked around the office he
[01:12:31.280 --> 01:12:36.600]  kind of looked up at the ceiling tiles and when he left they kind of dashed to
[01:12:36.600 --> 01:12:42.520]  the car and got the heck out of here like they were very uncomfortable and I
[01:12:42.520 --> 01:12:47.000]  was in the little studio at that time we hadn't started using this was like two
[01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:49.840]  and a half years ago and I'm not exaggerating folks what you see in his
[01:12:49.840 --> 01:12:52.360]  triggering it was even more but he would sit there and I thought this is
[01:12:52.360 --> 01:12:56.480]  tooth hurting is that a tick but he was trying to intimidate me which was a
[01:12:56.480 --> 01:13:04.600]  joke and he was just like going he was on air for like a whole hour wasn't he
[01:13:04.600 --> 01:13:09.680]  I think so maybe like an hour and a half they wanted to come here and they
[01:13:09.680 --> 01:13:14.400]  just wanted to sit there in the chair like and like I don't know what's going
[01:13:14.400 --> 01:13:17.560]  on with this guy but it's freakish in fact I want to put the governor well
[01:13:17.560 --> 01:13:20.360]  clip but I want to get to our guest let's play the Gary Johnson being
[01:13:20.360 --> 01:13:24.080]  triggered first when he's instructing the town hall reporter that you're not
[01:13:24.080 --> 01:13:27.680]  allowed to use the term illegal alien and again this is a little bit of what I
[01:13:27.680 --> 01:13:31.560]  was getting during the breaks but he wasn't talking he was sitting there
[01:13:31.560 --> 01:13:36.680]  showing his teeth and like looking at me at you know with one eye and and
[01:13:36.680 --> 01:13:40.280]  wiggling around it was almost like Emperor Palpatine when he's angry in
[01:13:40.280 --> 01:13:44.960]  episode 3 of Star Wars it was kind of like wiggling and snaking that was it
[01:13:44.960 --> 01:13:48.880]  he was snaking around the office I've never seen anyone walk around like
[01:13:48.880 --> 01:13:53.960]  they're a bipedal snake so let's go to snake man right now because they couldn't
[01:13:53.960 --> 01:14:00.040]  get in legally and the jobs existed and you or I would have done the same thing
[01:14:00.040 --> 01:14:05.320]  and we're talking about now coming from New Mexico a population with 48%
[01:14:05.320 --> 01:14:13.200]  Hispanic how's the crackdown on 11 million that's once he's already mad
[01:14:13.200 --> 01:14:17.240]  that's nothing it's how he goes from looking completely normal and friendly
[01:14:17.240 --> 01:14:22.080]  and going no no I tell you all the world works then he snaps and it's just a
[01:14:22.080 --> 01:14:26.000]  small little because I mean we all snap I get angry the point is is I'm not a
[01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:29.720]  psychologist so I'm not literally saying he's a psychopath or sociopath all I'm
[01:14:29.720 --> 01:14:33.080]  saying is the guy's really creepy he wants to put us under the TPP he's now
[01:14:33.080 --> 01:14:37.040]  become anti-gun his VP guys totally anti-gun let's play the clip from the
[01:14:37.040 --> 01:14:42.760]  beginning you have defended President Obama's executive amnesty action where
[01:14:42.760 --> 01:14:51.080]  he basically decided unilaterally that he was going to issue work visas to
[01:14:51.080 --> 01:14:56.680]  millions of adult illegal immigrants who are here in the country undocumented by
[01:14:56.680 --> 01:15:01.440]  the way if you use the term illegal immigrants that is very incendiary to
[01:15:01.440 --> 01:15:06.400]  our Hispanic population here in this country why is that it just is it just
[01:15:06.400 --> 01:15:10.080]  is just so that you know just so that you know and you don't have to use that
[01:15:10.080 --> 01:15:14.840]  term but isn't the term accurate in the in the sense that they entered the
[01:15:14.840 --> 01:15:18.960]  country they immigrated to the country illegally so they are I'm not a came into
[01:15:18.960 --> 01:15:25.240]  this country because they couldn't get in legally and the jobs existed and you
[01:15:25.240 --> 01:15:32.480]  or I would have done the same thing and we're talking about now the point is is
[01:15:32.480 --> 01:15:36.400]  that no they came here because they can get a bunch of free welfare and have
[01:15:36.400 --> 01:15:39.480]  their kids paid for everything else and everybody else's expense and then they
[01:15:39.480 --> 01:15:43.880]  undercut everybody else's pay including their own by bringing in a permanent
[01:15:43.880 --> 01:15:47.840]  underclass I don't want to exploit anybody and then acting like that they're
[01:15:47.840 --> 01:15:51.000]  on this high horse and these angels is disgusting I want to tackle this first
[01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:54.200]  what you think of Gary Johnson and obviously the mainstream media is
[01:15:54.200 --> 01:15:58.280]  pushing him as a messiah against Trump so you know he's bad the establishment is
[01:15:58.280 --> 01:16:01.080]  doing it and then get into everything else that's happening the economy the
[01:16:01.080 --> 01:16:05.280]  world where you see all this going John Rappaport investigative journalist with
[01:16:05.280 --> 01:16:09.680]  no more fake news calm thank you for coming on with us today hi Alex let's
[01:16:09.680 --> 01:16:15.840]  all vote for Hillary Johnson she is going to divorce Bill and marry Gary and
[01:16:15.840 --> 01:16:22.880]  let's have a big celebration because they are apparently as sleazy slimy and
[01:16:22.880 --> 01:16:28.560]  slippery as each other and it's a good fit I think Hillary Johnson for
[01:16:28.560 --> 01:16:35.960]  president I mean they brought this guy in as an agent basically you know he I'm
[01:16:35.960 --> 01:16:42.040]  a libertarian no you're an agent that's what you are you're there to disrupt the
[01:16:42.040 --> 01:16:46.320]  vote to take some votes away from Trump as many as you possibly can while
[01:16:46.320 --> 01:16:52.680]  pretending you're a libertarian who by the way wants to ratify the biggest
[01:16:52.680 --> 01:16:59.480]  globalist takedown ever in the TPP trans-specific partnership where that
[01:16:59.480 --> 01:17:05.880]  comes off as being libertarian is you know beyond anybody's recollection or
[01:17:05.880 --> 01:17:11.880]  intelligence because it's totally counter so the libertarian party is out I
[01:17:11.880 --> 01:17:18.400]  mean they're gone why don't they just put up a sign that says who's gonna pay us
[01:17:18.400 --> 01:17:22.720]  the most money will run the candidate that'll take the votes away from the
[01:17:22.720 --> 01:17:27.240]  other guy I mean that's libertarianism now that's to me the definition of the
[01:17:27.240 --> 01:17:32.080]  libertarian party we're for sale who's got the highest offer we'll say anything
[01:17:32.080 --> 01:17:36.440]  we'll put any candidate up it doesn't matter what he used to say this is what
[01:17:36.440 --> 01:17:40.800]  he's gonna say now and that's the way the whole thing's gonna work beautifully
[01:17:40.800 --> 01:17:43.800]  said you know they demonize Trump coming up with good slogans to describe
[01:17:43.800 --> 01:17:47.920]  someone's character crooked Hillary lying Ted what do we say about Gary
[01:17:47.920 --> 01:17:52.880]  Johnson Hillary's husband Gary Johnson or Hillary's running mate Gary Johnson
[01:17:52.880 --> 01:17:57.280]  I mean how do we describe him Hillary's husband I love I think that's a good
[01:17:57.280 --> 01:18:02.120]  way you point I mean you coined it John report okay well can I sell it do we
[01:18:02.120 --> 01:18:08.960]  got posters stickers whatever I was thinking snake man Gary Johnson I was
[01:18:08.960 --> 01:18:15.720]  thinking you know election spoiler Gary Johnson I was the Democratic Party
[01:18:15.720 --> 01:18:19.120]  savior Gary Johnson and I'm not thinking was good terms as you have I was
[01:18:19.120 --> 01:18:23.280]  there I mean how do you really describe him slimy Gary Johnson anti-gun Gary
[01:18:23.280 --> 01:18:28.480]  Johnson I guess it's really Hillary's husband Gary Johnson heard her husband
[01:18:28.480 --> 01:18:34.560]  Gary Johnson I mean there it is as far as I'm concerned she wore Bill out you
[01:18:34.560 --> 01:18:39.800]  know he's gone he's just a Hulk she's getting there herself but in the meantime
[01:18:39.800 --> 01:18:45.600]  she could use a little bit of an infusion of energy from somewhere so let's
[01:18:45.600 --> 01:18:52.200]  marry off Hillary to Gary Hillary and Gary Hillary Johnson it really is
[01:18:52.200 --> 01:18:55.320]  transparent though how can the libertarian support the secret TPP that
[01:18:55.320 --> 01:18:58.160]  basically they now admit takes everything over it's the world government
[01:18:58.160 --> 01:19:03.200]  final mega treaty and you've got him then bringing an anti-gunner who says
[01:19:03.200 --> 01:19:07.240]  arrest people that have guns that hold over five rounds nationwide make them
[01:19:07.240 --> 01:19:12.120]  all criminals I mean how in the world are libertarians putting up with this I
[01:19:12.120 --> 01:19:18.440]  don't know I have no idea I mean who are they even now they come together what
[01:19:18.440 --> 01:19:24.080]  is it every four years and they pick a new guy to run and then they go away they
[01:19:24.080 --> 01:19:30.040]  don't have any status or standing that they've established on their own it
[01:19:30.040 --> 01:19:35.360]  seems like they're just basically raising money off the word libertarian you
[01:19:35.360 --> 01:19:39.320]  know if they didn't have that in their title if they call themselves I don't
[01:19:39.320 --> 01:19:45.080]  know the Gary Johnson party or or just the the four-year party every four
[01:19:45.080 --> 01:19:48.560]  years we nominate somebody nothing would ever happen I mean they're just
[01:19:48.560 --> 01:19:54.080]  poaching on the word libertarian which has a history it does mean something
[01:19:54.080 --> 01:20:01.120]  Ron Paul was over there you know on that side of things but now it's just
[01:20:01.120 --> 01:20:07.080]  where for sale who's got some money we'll offer you a candidate that'll say
[01:20:07.080 --> 01:20:12.080]  what you want him to say and I agree with you completely this guy he reminds
[01:20:12.080 --> 01:20:17.520]  me Johnson a little bit of a snapping turtle you know when I was a kid a
[01:20:17.520 --> 01:20:22.600]  snapping turtle came into our backyard and I was warned and I looked at this
[01:20:22.600 --> 01:20:25.880]  thing was pretty big and it wasn't moving and I thought what harm could that
[01:20:25.880 --> 01:20:30.840]  you know just let me walk up to it and look at it and I kind of put my finger
[01:20:30.840 --> 01:20:35.400]  near where I thought his head would be an all of a sudden pow he was a snapping
[01:20:35.400 --> 01:20:40.120]  turtle man and that's the way he turned in that interview all of a sudden well
[01:20:40.120 --> 01:20:44.880]  don't use that term and so forth and then bang you know he suddenly attacks and
[01:20:44.880 --> 01:20:48.920]  again I get mad interviews too but it was the instantaneousness it was how he
[01:20:48.920 --> 01:20:53.720]  had this fake friendly demeanor and then instantly like a moray eel or a snapping
[01:20:53.720 --> 01:20:56.760]  turtle shoots out of the hole and I'm telling you I'm not exaggerating the
[01:20:56.760 --> 01:21:00.280]  creepiness in that studio a few years ago I don't even think I want when he was
[01:21:00.280 --> 01:21:03.360]  sitting there at first I thought like something was wrong with his face or he
[01:21:03.360 --> 01:21:06.600]  was having a seizure because he was like really looking like going to that kill
[01:21:06.600 --> 01:21:10.760]  me and I was like and he wouldn't talk to me during the breaks hardly and then
[01:21:10.760 --> 01:21:14.160]  after a couple breaks out this guy is really hating on me but then getting on
[01:21:14.160 --> 01:21:18.160]  air and acting on nice and I remember asking the crew why do you even come
[01:21:18.160 --> 01:21:21.520]  here it was actually really weird you're a smart guy in a psychology and that's
[01:21:21.520 --> 01:21:24.400]  what you write about what do you think that sounds like what you just heard
[01:21:24.400 --> 01:21:30.120]  myself and CJ described because believe me that's what he was doing I've seen a
[01:21:30.120 --> 01:21:36.800]  lot of people who have this you know they used to call them yuppies 10 15 years
[01:21:36.800 --> 01:21:44.320]  ago a sense of tremendous entitlement education scholarship learning and all
[01:21:44.320 --> 01:21:49.680]  of this and they talk and they smile and they kind of come off like sort of
[01:21:49.680 --> 01:21:54.520]  wimpoids you know and they know what's best and everything they love listen
[01:21:54.520 --> 01:21:58.280]  themselves talk they love listen themselves talk they feel you know
[01:21:58.280 --> 01:22:04.280]  white shoe as you said very entitled but of course I'm for the masses and
[01:22:04.280 --> 01:22:10.240]  everybody and I love everybody and all this bullshit basically but then if you
[01:22:10.240 --> 01:22:18.400]  puncture that suddenly now comes the real person right who's totally unhinged
[01:22:18.400 --> 01:22:25.000]  snapping turtle who can't stand you know to be around anybody that disagrees with
[01:22:25.000 --> 01:22:29.360]  them or challenges their viewpoint or even ask them a pointed question like
[01:22:29.360 --> 01:22:34.800]  this guy did in the interview no no that's not allowable suddenly you know
[01:22:34.800 --> 01:22:38.960]  they go crazy and that's right they can't even debate and now I realize
[01:22:38.960 --> 01:22:42.560]  that's why he was getting so mad I was just nicely debating with him and he was
[01:22:42.560 --> 01:22:46.520]  getting madder and madder yeah that they can't enter into one of those
[01:22:46.520 --> 01:22:52.240]  conversations at all because they have to be you know on top that's basically
[01:22:52.240 --> 01:22:58.440]  it's kind of like a fascist in a great picture there a fascist in sheep's
[01:22:58.440 --> 01:23:04.440]  clothing right and they're very nice and they kind of come off as humble and you
[01:23:04.440 --> 01:23:08.800]  know the whole thing I'm sure that you could get Gary to talk for hours and
[01:23:08.800 --> 01:23:15.880]  hours about his phony ideas on white privilege and how you know he's doing
[01:23:15.880 --> 01:23:20.840]  penance and repentance for this and that and everybody else should and all
[01:23:20.840 --> 01:23:25.800]  this kind of stuff and then all of a sudden yeah there's a good resemblance
[01:23:25.800 --> 01:23:31.560]  between this turtle snapping turtle and Gary the nose the mouth or he's ready to
[01:23:31.560 --> 01:23:39.640]  here he comes you know it's that it's that schizoid thing you know where he's
[01:23:39.640 --> 01:23:45.720]  going to be wonderful to everybody about everything until there's a danger that
[01:23:45.720 --> 01:23:49.560]  you know he might be exposed for something that he's saying and that it's
[01:23:49.560 --> 01:23:53.120]  wrong and that you're going to drill down a little bit deeper and it's going to
[01:23:53.120 --> 01:23:56.160]  get wronger and wronger and wronger and then all of a sudden he's going to
[01:23:56.160 --> 01:23:59.160]  totally sap at you and that's what happens this is a longer interview the
[01:23:59.160 --> 01:24:03.120]  town hall did a great job with he never debates anything he just goes no no no
[01:24:03.120 --> 01:24:06.000]  but what about the executive orders of Obama what about how are being run by
[01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:11.040]  foreign treaties I'm not discussing it I I'm an intellectual I guess really
[01:24:11.040 --> 01:24:15.360]  he's an empty suit is what it comes down to I think so and you find that with
[01:24:15.360 --> 01:24:20.760]  college professors for example you know when you actually start to engage them
[01:24:20.760 --> 01:24:26.400]  on a point that they can't really defend and they've got their whole mask set up
[01:24:26.400 --> 01:24:31.200]  so that this is the way they're going to feed you their spiel and so forth and
[01:24:31.200 --> 01:24:39.200]  now you puncture that college professors can become instant snapping turtles you
[01:24:39.200 --> 01:24:43.080]  go outside their box where they've got everything figured out and defined I
[01:24:43.080 --> 01:24:48.920]  mean this is again entitlement it's a position I've got my position I won my
[01:24:48.920 --> 01:24:52.760]  position I earned my and like you said last week part and parcel of the
[01:24:52.760 --> 01:24:56.400]  Salatarianism whether it be fascism communism whatever it is a cult is that
[01:24:56.400 --> 01:25:00.360]  it's all rigid top-down systems where everything's got to be finite and
[01:25:00.360 --> 01:25:04.800]  basically frozen in time that's what these people are looking to build that's
[01:25:04.800 --> 01:25:11.720]  why they hate the renaissance system absolutely yeah open freedom creativity
[01:25:11.720 --> 01:25:19.000]  imagination new ideas new frontiers let's have solutions instead of insanity
[01:25:19.000 --> 01:25:23.960]  let's have real solutions let's lift people up instead of making them
[01:25:23.960 --> 01:25:28.640]  permanently dependent upon whoever the leadership is the government so forth
[01:25:28.640 --> 01:25:33.480]  and so on these kinds of ideas hey I've got an idea professor you know you're
[01:25:33.480 --> 01:25:40.160]  talking about how sympathy for the people who are downtrodden so forth and
[01:25:40.160 --> 01:25:43.120]  so on do you know that in Chicago there's a group of people who are
[01:25:43.120 --> 01:25:47.760]  operating inside a huge building and they have an urban farm there and people
[01:25:47.760 --> 01:25:51.800]  from the inner cities are growing food fantastic amounts of food and they're
[01:25:51.800 --> 01:25:54.760]  learning how to grow food and the kids are there and they're trading food and
[01:25:54.760 --> 01:25:59.480]  this is like a renaissance of nutrition and if the government wanted to the
[01:25:59.480 --> 01:26:02.680]  federal government they could suddenly show up and say you know what this is a
[01:26:02.680 --> 01:26:06.920]  fantastic idea instead of spending two trillion dollars on the war on poverty and
[01:26:06.920 --> 01:26:12.960]  failing completely let's spend a few million dollars and let's put oh how
[01:26:12.960 --> 01:26:17.360]  about four thousand of these urban farms and inner cities across no instead as
[01:26:17.360 --> 01:26:21.000]  you know I've had the guy on the did it in LA when he started planning stuff in
[01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:25.080]  the in the mediums they came to try to stop him but he fought back and it back
[01:26:25.080 --> 01:26:29.600]  fire but exactly we need to bring urban farming back we have a special coming
[01:26:29.600 --> 01:26:34.360]  out next week with Tim Kennedy about urban farms and this is exactly getting
[01:26:34.360 --> 01:26:39.440]  back to normal agrarian activity is the beginning of relaunching humanity and
[01:26:39.440 --> 01:26:44.800]  that's why they're trying to harass the Amish these these city farms they're
[01:26:44.800 --> 01:26:51.400]  going after true independence for a reason absolutely and also I mean here's
[01:26:51.400 --> 01:26:56.400]  perfect community organizing you know six people get together and say we're
[01:26:56.400 --> 01:27:00.840]  gonna start an urban farm and everybody can come in on board and we'll trade
[01:27:00.840 --> 01:27:06.360]  food that we grow and the kids will be running around squeezing the cantaloupes
[01:27:06.360 --> 01:27:10.000]  and the squashes and whatever and they'll learn how to plant food and
[01:27:10.000 --> 01:27:13.480]  everybody will be happy and they'll be eating nutritious food and so on and so
[01:27:13.480 --> 01:27:17.560]  forth I mean you would expect a federal government that had any kind of sense
[01:27:17.560 --> 01:27:22.120]  that actually wanted solutions to poverty would put that at the top of the
[01:27:22.120 --> 01:27:28.080]  list right so you bring up something like this to a guy who is entitled white
[01:27:28.080 --> 01:27:34.400]  shoe yuppified you know trying to be distinguished and so forth and so on and
[01:27:34.400 --> 01:27:38.960]  all of a sudden it's outside his box it's an actual solution say well instead of
[01:27:38.960 --> 01:27:43.240]  writing all this bullshit about how the poverty people who are in poverty are
[01:27:43.240 --> 01:27:48.440]  doomed unless we revolutionize our minds about privilege and all how about we
[01:27:48.440 --> 01:27:52.760]  just actually help people to lift themselves up what an idea oh no no no
[01:27:52.760 --> 01:27:56.360]  no now they turn into a snapping turtle because they feel threatened because
[01:27:56.360 --> 01:28:00.880]  exactly they want those inner-city kids in there 12 hours a day watching TV the
[01:28:00.880 --> 01:28:05.080]  other hours of the day you know at school under government brainwashing and
[01:28:05.080 --> 01:28:11.200]  notice every city that's Democratic Party run is the most horrible cesspit you
[01:28:11.200 --> 01:28:14.960]  can imagine and they know it's a system they're running but they now want to
[01:28:14.960 --> 01:28:19.040]  deploy nationwide worldwide we're about to go to break but I've got a lot of
[01:28:19.040 --> 01:28:21.520]  issues I want to raise a lot of clips I want to play a lot of things want to go
[01:28:21.520 --> 01:28:24.480]  with you John around board but what else do you want to be covering today give us
[01:28:24.480 --> 01:28:29.240]  a preview well we can certainly talk about this pesticide spraying in South
[01:28:29.240 --> 01:28:33.840]  Carolina that killed millions of bees and what sounded like one day I mean
[01:28:33.840 --> 01:28:38.360]  this is like a chemical warfare against South Carolina you know the Zika
[01:28:38.360 --> 01:28:43.720]  pesticide so we can touch they said it was safe oh yeah absolutely no problem
[01:28:43.720 --> 01:28:47.360]  you know yeah maybe a little bit of a health problem all of a sudden the
[01:28:47.360 --> 01:28:51.360]  colonies are gone the bees are gone and what about the people and the animals
[01:28:51.360 --> 01:28:56.320]  oh no problem no problem just let's move on well I mean even the London
[01:28:56.320 --> 01:28:59.080]  Guardian says radiation is no longer really bad for you Jim you saw those
[01:28:59.080 --> 01:29:02.480]  articles my mom be on others they said we should you know radiation is good
[01:29:02.480 --> 01:29:07.680]  John okay well let's move next to some nuclear reactors let's all move to
[01:29:07.680 --> 01:29:11.920]  Fukushima then right I'm sure the apartment out of the condos they're
[01:29:11.920 --> 01:29:16.480]  pretty cheap now at Fukushima what we see happening is the insanity of the
[01:29:16.480 --> 01:29:20.560]  elite those the gods would destroy they first make mad and we're just here
[01:29:20.560 --> 01:29:24.200]  watching on the wall Paul Revere's self-interested I mean I don't want to
[01:29:24.200 --> 01:29:27.080]  live in a collapsed society and then we see what's happening in Europe in
[01:29:27.080 --> 01:29:30.520]  Germany we're getting into that we're even the economy we're gonna cover what's
[01:29:30.520 --> 01:29:33.240]  happening with the bees straight ahead with John Rabbi poor of no more fake
[01:29:33.240 --> 01:29:37.720]  news.com I'm Alex Jones with info wars.com and I've I've been pretty darn
[01:29:37.720 --> 01:29:41.080]  nasty to Gary Johnson you know I held my tongue haven't had him on in years
[01:29:41.080 --> 01:29:46.080]  because the guy gave me the willies and now he's an anti-gun pro-globalist
[01:29:46.080 --> 01:29:52.080]  little creature working for Hillary. We're on the march the Empire's on the
[01:29:52.080 --> 01:29:58.280]  run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network
[01:29:59.640 --> 01:30:04.640]  Joe Biggs here with info wars.com Colin Kaepernick says the pigs on his socks
[01:30:04.640 --> 01:30:09.480]  were only meant to represent row cops Colin Kaepernick made more news Thursday
[01:30:09.480 --> 01:30:13.160]  when photos of him wearing socks with pictures of pigs dressed like police
[01:30:13.160 --> 01:30:18.320]  officers began attracting attention. This is the same guy who refused to stay
[01:30:18.320 --> 01:30:22.520]  enough during the national anthem. The San Francisco 49ers quarterback addressed
[01:30:22.520 --> 01:30:26.600]  the situation with an Instagram post later in the morning. I wore these socks
[01:30:26.600 --> 01:30:29.920]  in the past because the row cops that are allowed to hold positions in police
[01:30:29.920 --> 01:30:33.760]  departments not only put the community in danger but also put the cops that have
[01:30:33.760 --> 01:30:37.120]  the right intentions in danger by creating an environment of tension and
[01:30:37.120 --> 01:30:41.200]  mistrust. He added that he wore the socks before he started sitting down during
[01:30:41.200 --> 01:30:45.360]  the national anthem prior to the 49ers pre-season games this year. There is
[01:30:45.360 --> 01:30:48.760]  police brutality the quarterback said. People of color have been targeted by
[01:30:48.760 --> 01:30:52.400]  police so that's a large part of it and their government officials. They are
[01:30:52.400 --> 01:30:55.920]  put in place by the government so that's something that this country has to
[01:30:55.920 --> 01:31:00.720]  change. You can find more reports like this at info wars.com. More than two years
[01:31:00.720 --> 01:31:05.080]  ago info wars first told you about our research into what has been called the
[01:31:05.080 --> 01:31:08.880]  iodine conspiracy. I've told you about how scientists have known for decades
[01:31:08.880 --> 01:31:13.440]  that iodine deficiencies can devastate IQ and how the government knowingly
[01:31:13.440 --> 01:31:17.600]  started taking iodine out of the food and adding fluoride the bad member of
[01:31:17.600 --> 01:31:21.720]  the halogen family into the water. They took the good halogen out and put the
[01:31:21.720 --> 01:31:25.840]  deadly halogen in and when the Fukushima crisis worsened as it still is
[01:31:25.840 --> 01:31:29.800]  worsening today I was there telling you how to prepare yourself and your family.
[01:31:29.800 --> 01:31:35.320]  Now in 2016 even more information has been revealed concerning the connection
[01:31:35.320 --> 01:31:39.840]  between iodine and the gut which many experts are now saying could be the
[01:31:39.840 --> 01:31:44.160]  biggest revelation ever concerning iodine. You can pull these studies up for
[01:31:44.160 --> 01:31:48.280]  yourself. This is the real deal folks and the truth is that iodine is essential
[01:31:48.280 --> 01:31:53.840]  in my view to any optimum health regimen. Stock up on survival shield X2 today at

[01:32:00.280 --> 01:32:03.840]  pharmacist Ben Fuchs here host of the Bright Side and as many of you know I'm
[01:32:03.840 --> 01:32:07.240]  on a mission to help Americans get and stay healthy. You've all heard the
[01:32:07.240 --> 01:32:10.640]  shocking statistics despite spending trillions of dollars in health care
[01:32:10.640 --> 01:32:16.040]  nearly $10,000 per man woman and child in this country. Obesity, diabetes, cancer,
[01:32:16.040 --> 01:32:19.800]  heart disease and autoimmune illnesses are rampant. One out of three or four

[01:33:42.680 --> 01:33:46.200]  is gonna be hosting hosting with me in the fourth hour today I'm gonna go ahead
[01:33:46.200 --> 01:33:49.560]  and do most of the fourth hour I made that decision because the crew does so
[01:33:49.560 --> 01:33:52.480]  much work with all these clips and all this research and all this incredible
[01:33:52.480 --> 01:33:57.120]  stuff I haven't even gotten to yet I must cover it all but I want to be clear
[01:33:57.120 --> 01:34:04.160]  with everybody out there watching I don't look at the news and try to come in
[01:34:04.160 --> 01:34:12.880]  here and exaggerate what's going on my head now more than ever spins when I do
[01:34:12.880 --> 01:34:20.440]  research and it's so much crazier than I can describe to people and they've had
[01:34:20.440 --> 01:34:23.200]  the White House run media matters and others make a big deal out of me saying
[01:34:23.200 --> 01:34:30.800]  on air I've studied this for 25 years I don't know about spiritual forces in the
[01:34:30.800 --> 01:34:38.120]  universe I've I've studied physics I've studied what the elite believe billions
[01:34:38.120 --> 01:34:43.840]  of Christians believe that the devil is an outside force fallen on this planet
[01:34:43.840 --> 01:34:49.040]  manipulating humanity to kill seal and destroy and basically attack God's
[01:34:49.040 --> 01:34:52.520]  creation and then I look at the world and what the elite are doing they'll go
[01:34:52.520 --> 01:34:56.120]  out of their way to hurt the planet while they claim to the guardians of it
[01:34:56.120 --> 01:34:59.360]  they are trying to play God Ray Kurzweil says he's gonna merge with machines
[01:34:59.360 --> 01:35:03.000]  and become God almost every major billionaire out there goes to these
[01:35:03.000 --> 01:35:06.800]  private consortium meetings and they discuss how to bring in world government
[01:35:06.800 --> 01:35:11.560]  exterminate the majority of us Bill Joy writes cover articles about it admitting
[01:35:11.560 --> 01:35:15.880]  it and then the White House puts out a thing saying Jones is crazy and says
[01:35:15.880 --> 01:35:22.320]  space aliens run the planet no what I said is that what you read in the Bible
[01:35:22.320 --> 01:35:25.680]  and what the Bible says the devil wants to do to us is basically what I see
[01:35:25.680 --> 01:35:31.520]  going on so whether you're a Christian or whether even an atheist you look at
[01:35:31.520 --> 01:35:36.200]  what's going on they're creating aliens on this planet then they cut right there
[01:35:36.200 --> 01:35:41.920]  and they put it the New York Times and they say the guy that Donald Trump
[01:35:41.920 --> 01:35:46.640]  calls brilliant says it looks like space aliens run things no that was a
[01:35:46.640 --> 01:35:51.080]  complex discussion I had I said I don't know that I haven't seen that the
[01:35:51.080 --> 01:35:54.960]  globalist act like aliens psychopaths believe they're their own species the
[01:35:54.960 --> 01:35:59.280]  elite in big college papers and books say they're gonna break away and be their
[01:35:59.280 --> 01:36:05.520]  own gods I just quoted Ray Kurzweil I can quote all these people to you so
[01:36:05.520 --> 01:36:13.600]  whether it is the devil whatever it is the elite are basically manifesting this
[01:36:13.600 --> 01:36:17.360]  when they splice humans with animals when they do all these horrible things
[01:36:17.360 --> 01:36:22.360]  when they create all these GMO hybrids and release them out in the open air
[01:36:22.360 --> 01:36:28.040]  from microscopic up to humanoids it's extremely dangerous then do these
[01:36:28.040 --> 01:36:32.160]  creatures have rights they're in this gray area animals have rights humans
[01:36:32.160 --> 01:36:36.080]  have rights these are the big discussions and then the White House
[01:36:36.080 --> 01:36:40.600]  organs make a joke about it so we can't have a debate as all this technology
[01:36:40.600 --> 01:36:44.640]  races just like I told you the NSA 20 years ago was listening to keywords and
[01:36:44.640 --> 01:36:49.240]  putting it in dossiers and the DEA was doing parallel construction setting
[01:36:49.240 --> 01:36:53.880]  people up with fake court cases I had whistleblowers on at the time who were
[01:36:53.880 --> 01:36:58.120]  just as important as Snowden but back then they didn't arrest whistleblowers
[01:36:58.120 --> 01:37:03.760]  so it never even got coverage the internet wasn't big enough then so what
[01:37:03.760 --> 01:37:08.400]  I'm getting in here is I told you all about the New World Order all about
[01:37:08.400 --> 01:37:11.800]  their global plan all about their carbon taxes how they would set it up how
[01:37:11.800 --> 01:37:14.960]  they would roll it out how they'd use huge immigrant waves and collapsing
[01:37:14.960 --> 01:37:18.720]  Third World to then make the West fall as well I broke it all down I showed you
[01:37:18.720 --> 01:37:23.240]  the university papers I broke down clowered and piven you know as an
[01:37:23.240 --> 01:37:27.560]  audience this is real you gave me a lot of information as well now they've
[01:37:27.560 --> 01:37:32.280]  constructed this thing and I really see it in the news I see it on the street in
[01:37:32.280 --> 01:37:38.960]  the last few weeks they have intensified their operations 20 times I believe the
[01:37:38.960 --> 01:37:43.920]  New World Order started September 1st that's a date I'm putting on it they
[01:37:43.920 --> 01:37:47.440]  like to launch things September 1st and just the whole atmosphere has changed
[01:37:47.440 --> 01:37:51.880]  all the intensification of evil the intensification of mind war the
[01:37:51.880 --> 01:37:58.600]  intensification of the brainwashing has all just crescendoed like a huge
[01:37:58.600 --> 01:38:05.800]  finale of an orchestra at the end of a play and right when you thought it
[01:38:05.800 --> 01:38:11.080]  couldn't get louder it went way up above that now I'm gonna ask this gentleman
[01:38:11.080 --> 01:38:13.360]  he's a really smart fellow and he studied this in depth he could probably
[01:38:13.360 --> 01:38:16.960]  bring some clarity to this disagree if you disagree John I know you will or
[01:38:16.960 --> 01:38:19.400]  agree and then break down before we get into what's happening to the earth
[01:38:19.400 --> 01:38:25.440]  itself and the bees why this is happening and and and what you would say
[01:38:25.440 --> 01:38:28.880]  about this point we've reached in the universe and and and why the elite
[01:38:28.880 --> 01:38:34.440]  universally are building something that's anti-human and so ugly I mean there
[01:38:34.440 --> 01:38:38.960]  is a spirit to it there is a energy to it I don't know where it's coming from I
[01:38:38.960 --> 01:38:44.480]  mean let's just say theoretically I don't know I mean I'm a Christian I'm
[01:38:44.480 --> 01:38:48.840]  raised that way I love goodness I love God but but let's just for the sake of
[01:38:48.840 --> 01:38:52.480]  debate what is it and then we're on this planet out here in the universe
[01:38:52.480 --> 01:38:55.920]  floating around hurling through space at 40,000 miles an hour and then people
[01:38:55.920 --> 01:38:59.200]  make a joke when we talk about evil in the world and where does it come from
[01:38:59.200 --> 01:39:03.600]  every culture has marveled why does some of us do these bad things why do
[01:39:03.600 --> 01:39:08.040]  elites organize together build pyramids and start chopping virgins hearts out I
[01:39:08.040 --> 01:39:11.640]  mean what's going on because 99% of us John don't want to do that
[01:39:11.640 --> 01:39:17.880]  absolutely well here's one of the things anyway look at what's happening
[01:39:17.880 --> 01:39:26.880]  anybody who says now that a nation has any right whatsoever to be sovereign in
[01:39:26.880 --> 01:39:35.000]  any sense of the word independent self-sufficient ooh God forbid that or an
[01:39:35.000 --> 01:39:39.440]  individual that's what it really comes down to independent makes up his own
[01:39:39.440 --> 01:39:44.640]  mind sees things the way he sees it makes decisions responsible for his own
[01:39:44.640 --> 01:39:52.440]  life in every way possible this is the cardinal sin this is what has to be
[01:39:52.440 --> 01:39:59.600]  attacked because the globalist plan obviously is to make one giant unified
[01:39:59.600 --> 01:40:06.640]  cheese glob of the entire planet that is run from above by them that's that's the
[01:40:06.640 --> 01:40:11.600]  theme that's what they've been shooting for and aiming for all along we're all
[01:40:11.600 --> 01:40:16.800]  together in this and it's all one it takes a village and you know all of this
[01:40:16.800 --> 01:40:24.920]  kind of insane supposedly humanitarian propaganda is a complete front for evil
[01:40:24.920 --> 01:40:29.000]  that's the way the game is played it's been played that way probably since the
[01:40:29.000 --> 01:40:32.560]  beginning of time but now there's technology and now there's media and
[01:40:32.560 --> 01:40:37.960]  now there's you know propaganda and so forth so they are perceiving the
[01:40:37.960 --> 01:40:45.880]  globalists the controllers the evil ones a bigger threat than ever because they
[01:40:45.880 --> 01:40:49.880]  can see around them that there is a movement in the other direction people
[01:40:49.880 --> 01:40:56.760]  are saying wait a minute are you saying that I don't know I was raised in France
[01:40:56.760 --> 01:41:01.800]  and so if I consider myself French I'm committing some kind of a thought crime
[01:41:01.800 --> 01:41:09.240]  now that I have to be European with everything that that implies that your
[01:41:09.240 --> 01:41:12.720]  implications and then you merge with Islam now you have to merge with that
[01:41:12.720 --> 01:41:18.320]  they're stealing our identities and then replacing it with death yeah with death
[01:41:18.320 --> 01:41:26.840]  exactly bow down don't say anything forgive everything be humble and die
[01:41:26.840 --> 01:41:33.240]  that seems to be the motto of globalism and we're sitting we the globalists are
[01:41:33.240 --> 01:41:36.880]  sitting in the steamroller and we're coming down the street they're saying
[01:41:36.880 --> 01:41:39.960]  it's our planet we took it over we're about to merge with machines to become
[01:41:39.960 --> 01:41:43.800]  gods get ready we're gonna kill you and they come out in publications every day
[01:41:43.800 --> 01:41:47.360]  now we talk about this 20 years ago John no one would talk about it and oh we're
[01:41:47.360 --> 01:41:51.480]  cooks we were reading their own white papers now it's all over the news the
[01:41:51.480 --> 01:41:55.360]  earth can be so great once humans are gone and elites you know are gonna merge
[01:41:55.360 --> 01:41:59.520]  with machines and become gods but only after they kill you and you're like whoa
[01:41:59.520 --> 01:42:04.640]  they're in the news saying this but it's like it's in new scientists and it's on
[01:42:04.640 --> 01:42:09.000]  CNN like it's fun like wow you've got it but it would be better without us on
[01:42:09.000 --> 01:42:14.840]  earth right let's all commit collective suicide as our final act of
[01:42:14.840 --> 01:42:20.200]  contrition and penance and so forth and I've been following this whole you know
[01:42:20.200 --> 01:42:26.040]  technocratic thing for a long time as well the whole idea like Ray Kurzweil and
[01:42:26.040 --> 01:42:29.400]  no I know you have that's why I've got you I mean I'm that's why I raise it go
[01:42:29.400 --> 01:42:34.920]  ahead and it and that you know the techies the rise of the techies the
[01:42:34.920 --> 01:42:40.960]  idea that they suddenly got into their heads that information itself is some
[01:42:40.960 --> 01:42:46.800]  kind of spiritual quality and if we can just supply people with the right
[01:42:46.800 --> 01:42:52.280]  answers through you know shaping information in the right algorithms then
[01:42:52.280 --> 01:42:56.040]  everything's going to be peaceful and fine on earth and the way to do that is
[01:42:56.040 --> 01:43:00.280]  to hook up the human brain to a massive super computer that's floating
[01:43:00.280 --> 01:43:05.000]  somewhere in space I mean they take this as obvious you know and if you start
[01:43:05.000 --> 01:43:09.840]  to raise questions wait a minute you're saying that my brain can be connected to
[01:43:09.840 --> 01:43:13.680]  a computer and what is this computer going to give me again answers to
[01:43:13.680 --> 01:43:16.880]  questions I mean how is that different from the
[01:43:16.880 --> 01:43:23.000]  priest class that rules Egypt or Stalin or somebody else who's giving me
[01:43:23.000 --> 01:43:28.560]  answers even if they're supposedly the right answers they're not my answers I
[01:43:28.560 --> 01:43:32.400]  didn't come to those conclusions I'm now going to be at the mercy of a
[01:43:32.400 --> 01:43:37.560]  computer and then they say well yes but it's not only that you see maybe you
[01:43:37.560 --> 01:43:42.440]  want to play the piano we can don't let download that into your mind too or you
[01:43:42.440 --> 01:43:47.520]  want to hit 60 home runs a year in the and you know pro baseball we can do that
[01:43:47.520 --> 01:43:52.280]  for you or you want to leap tall buildings in a single but no problem
[01:43:52.280 --> 01:43:55.680]  because the computer can give that to you and people just sit there and go boy
[01:43:55.680 --> 01:44:00.200]  this sounds like a really great future are you kidding I mean can you people
[01:44:00.200 --> 01:44:04.520]  can you think about this and how ridiculous I mean aside from being a
[01:44:04.520 --> 01:44:09.640]  total fascist setup can you even start to think about how ridiculous that
[01:44:09.640 --> 01:44:15.680]  sounds how is a computer going to do that for anybody it's not it's just
[01:44:15.680 --> 01:44:21.160]  another way to make slaves and we also have the UN pushing the zeitgeist
[01:44:21.160 --> 01:44:24.440]  movement that guy comes on my show and says you'll be putting a reeducation
[01:44:24.440 --> 01:44:28.240]  camp if you don't submit then he comes out and says I'm a liar it didn't happen
[01:44:28.240 --> 01:44:32.160]  when I have the clip and then the UN and the New York Times start funding it
[01:44:32.160 --> 01:44:36.400]  saying yes a computer will decide what you eat where you live what you do well
[01:44:36.400 --> 01:44:39.440]  that's always been their model of technocracy and then people say oh we'll
[01:44:39.440 --> 01:44:45.160]  be free no the globalist will program the computer I mean it's so obvious and
[01:44:45.160 --> 01:44:48.520]  people say why are you attacking the freedom of zeitgeist we won't have to
[01:44:48.520 --> 01:44:53.480]  work anymore I mean that's like telling me Obamacare was gonna be free John right
[01:44:53.480 --> 01:44:57.560]  we won't have to work anymore and we'll be free and as if you and I have
[01:44:57.560 --> 01:45:04.000]  discussed before Alex people have lost many people seem to have lost their
[01:45:04.000 --> 01:45:10.120]  capacity to even understand what the word freedom means so you can now as a
[01:45:10.120 --> 01:45:14.800]  propagandist substitute anything you want to for the word freedom a computer
[01:45:14.800 --> 01:45:18.440]  making you a total slave and taking all your decisions away and running your
[01:45:18.440 --> 01:45:26.040]  life is freedom because it's fair yeah that's right suddenly fair becomes free
[01:45:26.040 --> 01:45:29.560]  wait a minute how did that happen and then who defines fair and it says word
[01:45:29.560 --> 01:45:36.560]  there who defines exactly it's that word game freedom is unlimited burgers at
[01:45:36.560 --> 01:45:40.960]  McDonald's is that what that it means in other words if somebody says to me you
[01:45:40.960 --> 01:45:47.800]  can eat free for the rest of your life that's the same thing as me being free
[01:45:47.800 --> 01:45:52.560]  having freedom and then you find out it's Monsanto and Bill Gates and what
[01:45:52.560 --> 01:45:56.640]  they're feeding you is gonna kill you yeah right that's the punchline right
[01:45:56.640 --> 01:46:01.200]  yeah you're free to have there all the goodies you want and they will kill you
[01:46:01.200 --> 01:46:05.840]  so now everything's good so people don't even understand what the word means
[01:46:05.840 --> 01:46:11.040]  anymore so if you say the word freedoms well now they say I have a right not to
[01:46:11.040 --> 01:46:14.600]  be offended and so there's only small free speech zones on the colleges now
[01:46:14.600 --> 01:46:19.400]  and they're only open a few hours a day a few days a week so see you're you're in
[01:46:19.400 --> 01:46:24.480]  a free country in this little free zone that we license that we can close but
[01:46:24.480 --> 01:46:27.760]  the definition of a license is the authorization to do something that would
[01:46:27.760 --> 01:46:33.400]  otherwise be illegal or a letter of mark given to you by the royalty exactly
[01:46:33.400 --> 01:46:38.840]  at Harvard Law School which I wrote about this week again you know there
[01:46:38.840 --> 01:46:41.880]  were people these are supposed to be the best and the brightest college
[01:46:41.880 --> 01:46:45.720]  graduates and they go on to the most prestigious law school in the country
[01:46:45.720 --> 01:46:53.440]  Harvard and what happened there students said that they didn't want to hear the
[01:46:53.440 --> 01:47:01.360]  word rape or violate meaning does this conduct violate the law because either
[01:47:01.360 --> 01:47:05.520]  word could trigger them these were like the most elite law students in the
[01:47:05.520 --> 01:47:09.920]  country talking to their professor learning how to be basket cases learning
[01:47:09.920 --> 01:47:17.720]  how to become create yourself over in the image of a basket case exactly how
[01:47:17.720 --> 01:47:22.360]  do I become a victim and these students are saying well rape law shouldn't even
[01:47:22.360 --> 01:47:28.280]  be taught in law school because it would be traumatizing and it would reduce the
[01:47:28.280 --> 01:47:33.920]  overall performance of the students so now there's not even any pretense that
[01:47:33.920 --> 01:47:40.360]  there's education going on you know it's not even yes we are no it's all about
[01:47:40.360 --> 01:47:47.560]  this propaganda campaign to encourage and nudge students over into thinking of
[01:47:47.560 --> 01:47:54.040]  themselves not just as victims but endless victims and the only power they
[01:47:54.040 --> 01:47:58.520]  have is to go bully someone into doing what they say I mean it's like major
[01:47:58.520 --> 01:48:03.080]  universities have done things like Lynch Hall named after a liberal patron that
[01:48:03.080 --> 01:48:07.960]  built the hall 50 something years ago and then but then the attorney general
[01:48:07.960 --> 01:48:12.080]  agreed with it and said yes to the we need to change the name it's hurtful
[01:48:12.080 --> 01:48:17.080]  because of lynching and then her name is Loretta Lynch I mean there's no it's
[01:48:17.080 --> 01:48:19.880]  like people screaming it going you're an effing white male and they're in white
[01:48:19.880 --> 01:48:22.400]  male I want to play this clip since you mentioned the
[01:48:22.400 --> 01:48:26.000]  technocracy it's a good one I know Tom Scott's got a great YouTube channel
[01:48:26.000 --> 01:48:30.080]  breaking this down the virtual hell of uploading yourself into a machine and
[01:48:30.080 --> 01:48:33.240]  then they zap the bad memories that means your true memories and consciousness
[01:48:33.240 --> 01:48:37.120]  and then this is what the military is looking at now zapping that's a lobotomy

[01:51:12.080 --> 01:51:17.560]  Tom Scott calm look at Tom Scott on amazing works his YouTube channel now
[01:51:17.560 --> 01:51:23.440]  ladies and gentlemen I first envisioned this probably 15 years ago because I
[01:51:23.440 --> 01:51:27.040]  knew that they could go out randomly with bots target things on third party
[01:51:27.040 --> 01:51:30.960]  platforms and just have them deleted with no due process and then when Shazam
[01:51:30.960 --> 01:51:35.120]  came out a decade ago when you could hold up your so-called smartphone when
[01:51:35.120 --> 01:51:38.600]  they first came out at the mall or wherever what's that song it would tell
[01:51:38.600 --> 01:51:42.560]  you in like 10 seconds and remember thinking they're gonna use that to go
[01:51:42.560 --> 01:51:46.200]  out and find copyright music and stuff and of course they were and then I
[01:51:46.200 --> 01:51:52.960]  realized they could go out with these bots pick up my voice algorithm and
[01:51:52.960 --> 01:51:59.800]  erase me across the web under a globalist system if they're able to get
[01:51:59.800 --> 01:52:05.400]  all these draconian anti-free speech regulations and treaties in place now
[01:52:05.400 --> 01:52:11.400]  in 2016 they hand the web over to the UN next month the UN is admitting they're
[01:52:11.400 --> 01:52:14.480]  going to be shutting people down worldwide if they even criticize radical
[01:52:14.480 --> 01:52:17.760]  Islam you name it YouTube has put out new terms of service saying we'll
[01:52:17.760 --> 01:52:23.080]  demonetize you anytime the community complains and our diversity specialist
[01:52:23.080 --> 01:52:30.240]  say so and these are diversity specialists that will certify pardon me
[01:52:30.240 --> 01:52:37.360]  pardon me you were popping in my ear what were you saying there CJ sorry I was
[01:52:37.360 --> 01:52:40.640]  communicating with Dr. Harmon GCN oh sorry you had the pot open to the network
[01:52:40.640 --> 01:52:43.800]  sorry they were talking anyways it's fine we're teleprompter free it's live
[01:52:43.800 --> 01:52:49.680]  radio they were talking to folks at the network now continuing they can just
[01:52:49.680 --> 01:52:52.440]  erase your voice all over the web boom like that and now they're actually
[01:52:52.440 --> 01:52:56.000]  talking about doing that and then here's an example Joe Rogan have been on my
[01:52:56.000 --> 01:53:00.160]  show probably 30 40 times over the years and all of a sudden our YouTube
[01:53:00.160 --> 01:53:05.040]  channel was shut down and I went in there and it was all these copyright strikes
[01:53:05.040 --> 01:53:11.960]  that I had had Joe Rogan on it wasn't music it was him talking to me but they
[01:53:11.960 --> 01:53:15.960]  had monetized he signed an agreement that he didn't fully understand his spoken
[01:53:15.960 --> 01:53:20.600]  word and so I was being hit for copyright for having a conversation with
[01:53:20.600 --> 01:53:24.520]  him in studio and he had to have the copyright group working with YouTube go
[01:53:24.520 --> 01:53:28.080]  and switch all that off so what I'm getting at is when you just saw that
[01:53:28.080 --> 01:53:33.560]  terms of service piece from 2012 with a theoretical system in the future that's
[01:53:33.560 --> 01:53:36.440]  actually what Ray Kurzweil is talking about and that's what happens when you
[01:53:36.440 --> 01:53:42.000]  upload your quote photos your documents to the cloud you're opting in to give
[01:53:42.000 --> 01:53:46.440]  them everything you already are and you can see the premeditated architecture
[01:53:46.440 --> 01:53:55.360]  and and and nurture of this John Rappaport it's boggling that is the idea
[01:53:55.360 --> 01:54:01.480]  you establish this huge commons you want to call it where information is
[01:54:01.480 --> 01:54:05.480]  everywhere and so forth and so on and then you see that behind that is the
[01:54:05.480 --> 01:54:12.080]  intent to control rule absolute control of all of that we can delete this we can
[01:54:12.080 --> 01:54:17.280]  delete that we can take this out we can add that in fact we can claim that this
[01:54:17.280 --> 01:54:22.200]  person over here actually said this when he never did and then we can back that
[01:54:22.200 --> 01:54:26.280]  up with a thousand confirmations that that's true when it's a complete lie
[01:54:26.280 --> 01:54:31.840]  and by the time we're done that guy won't even know who he is anymore because
[01:54:31.840 --> 01:54:37.680]  he'll be misrepresented in a million ways all over the internet and then we
[01:54:37.680 --> 01:54:43.800]  can establish these machine bot trolls by the thousands and millions to back up
[01:54:43.800 --> 01:54:47.080]  everything that we're doing and screaming online and everything and all
[01:54:47.080 --> 01:54:53.640]  that you know so I mean this is like a propaganda sweat dream we're gonna run
[01:54:53.640 --> 01:54:59.680]  information we're gonna rule information and now you expect that somehow this
[01:54:59.680 --> 01:55:04.320]  gigantic computer in the sky that your brain is going to connect to is going to
[01:55:04.320 --> 01:55:12.400]  be benevolent inviting open interested in your ideas I mean are you crazy this
[01:55:12.400 --> 01:55:17.800]  is total fascism this is total mind control and talking about DARPA I mean
[01:55:17.800 --> 01:55:22.840]  they're involved in a project for example now where they want to be able to
[01:55:22.840 --> 01:55:29.240]  insert images directly into your visual cortex bypassing all the normal channels
[01:55:29.240 --> 01:55:34.960]  of perception so that it isn't even a question of trying to regulate or change
[01:55:34.960 --> 01:55:40.640]  what you see seeing will become what's inserted into the visual they will
[01:55:40.640 --> 01:55:43.760]  broadcast directly to the brain have already been able to successfully do it
[01:55:43.760 --> 01:55:47.240]  John Robbaport showing his great knowledge of what's happening and for
[01:55:47.240 --> 01:55:52.880]  listeners I'm not trying to scare you this project's ongoing they released it
[01:55:52.880 --> 01:55:57.720]  a few years ago declassified it but from a private corporation that Google when
[01:55:57.720 --> 01:56:02.000]  it was founded in the late 90s was having a board meeting it was getting CIA
[01:56:02.000 --> 01:56:06.000]  funding this is all admitted and the feds are saying we already have search
[01:56:06.000 --> 01:56:11.560]  engines this is NSA technology you know that searches your phone calls and your
[01:56:11.560 --> 01:56:15.360]  your emails I mean that's that that's what search engines are is basically an
[01:56:15.360 --> 01:56:20.920]  NSA search of their word database but now they get you to opt into it and then
[01:56:20.920 --> 01:56:23.480]  can direct you where they want to go and that's a dumbing down with the whole
[01:56:23.480 --> 01:56:29.400]  process but that's the basics well when you expand this now they went on to say
[01:56:29.400 --> 01:56:33.920]  in the minutes of the first corporate meeting of Google they said excuse us
[01:56:33.920 --> 01:56:39.200]  we're not this is not just NSA systems that you gave us we know that we're
[01:56:39.200 --> 01:56:42.240]  going to control reality by getting everybody to feed their information into
[01:56:42.240 --> 01:56:47.520]  it and there'll be a human computer interface that will teach it how to have
[01:56:47.520 --> 01:56:52.640]  a more than human brain more than human and then it will start giving impulses
[01:56:52.640 --> 01:56:56.760]  out to the humans to control them and we're going to have an AI system that
[01:56:56.760 --> 01:57:00.160]  can predict the future and then manipulate the future through the
[01:57:00.160 --> 01:57:03.480]  billions of humanoids that are interfaced with us you know read all
[01:57:03.480 --> 01:57:11.000]  this I mean this is so diabolical please continue this is obviously where
[01:57:11.000 --> 01:57:16.280]  they're going with this I mean from the beginning you could see this is what
[01:57:16.280 --> 01:57:21.760]  they want they always want more more control it's not just enough to give you
[01:57:21.760 --> 01:57:26.360]  an idea that then you suddenly think is your own when it's truly somebody else
[01:57:26.360 --> 01:57:31.680]  no well this is about absolute control this is the whole idea this is where
[01:57:31.680 --> 01:57:35.240]  they're going this is what they've been aiming for so they're thinking now do
[01:57:35.240 --> 01:57:40.320]  well it's all about the brain 21st century has been called the century of
[01:57:40.320 --> 01:57:44.640]  the brain you've got laboratories all over the world where researchers are
[01:57:44.640 --> 01:57:51.320]  doing work on the brain compartmentalized all over the place many many many
[01:57:51.320 --> 01:57:56.960]  many researchers and they're all talking about how they are working to cure
[01:57:56.960 --> 01:58:04.000]  diseases and most of them believe that's true they have no clue they're what I
[01:58:04.000 --> 01:58:10.560]  call high IQ idiots and so all of this work and research is being collated and
[01:58:10.560 --> 01:58:14.640]  behind the scenes the whole plan is to be able to control the brain at a
[01:58:14.640 --> 01:58:17.920]  distance absolutely that's where they're going that's right let's do five more
[01:58:17.920 --> 01:58:20.240]  minutes and Dr. Bachanik joins us I want to talk about what's happening the
[01:58:20.240 --> 01:58:24.320]  physical earth the globalist aren't just assaulting humans they're assaulting
[01:58:24.320 --> 01:58:29.800]  the entire fabric of life on this planet engaged in vandalism the never the
[01:58:29.800 --> 01:58:33.320]  lives of which we've never seen stay with us
[01:58:33.320 --> 01:58:45.720]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show this is GCN the Genesis communications
[01:58:45.720 --> 01:58:48.520]  radio network
[01:58:49.200 --> 01:58:54.960]  brain force it's completely different try a bottle of it Rob do joins us you
[01:58:54.960 --> 01:58:59.720]  worked I guess like 20 plus hours tell us what brain force I've been working all
[01:58:59.720 --> 01:59:04.600]  day I took a couple hours off coaching basketball I get in here at 830 I was
[01:59:04.600 --> 01:59:07.880]  kind of run down you know I just didn't feel like I was gonna make it and I
[01:59:07.880 --> 01:59:11.040]  really want to do a good job on the interview I got my bottle of brain force
[01:59:11.040 --> 01:59:15.080]  right there pop two of them and about 20 minutes later it's like being everything
[01:59:15.080 --> 01:59:19.240]  just kind of clears up it's got four and a half stars people really love it
[01:59:19.240 --> 01:59:23.360]  read about it find out why third-party nutraceutical sites give it such high
[01:59:23.360 --> 01:59:28.040]  praise because it really does have the best organic based systems that will
[01:59:28.040 --> 01:59:31.160]  blow your socks off I haven't pulled an all-nighter like that in a while but I
[01:59:31.160 --> 01:59:34.920]  probably could not have done it without brain force I went home about 645 this
[01:59:34.920 --> 01:59:39.680]  morning took three hours of sleep got up took two more in force and came in you
[01:59:39.680 --> 01:59:43.920]  will find a brain force and other game-changing products at info wars
[01:59:43.920 --> 01:59:50.200]  life dot com or call 888-253-3139
[01:59:50.200 --> 02:00:00.520]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[02:00:01.520 --> 02:00:07.040]  crashing through the lies and disinformation it's alex jones only
[02:00:07.040 --> 02:00:16.520]  on the GCN radio network what we're doing is just an emergency transmission
[02:00:16.520 --> 02:00:20.840]  so humanity has a choice to be aware of what's happening the globalists don't
[02:00:20.840 --> 02:00:24.520]  want to give you a choice they think they can suckery into this and what we're
[02:00:24.520 --> 02:00:29.600]  telling you is the truth it's all out in the open now we've really moved
[02:00:29.600 --> 02:00:34.240]  quickly into this and and my basic well-down is this the globalists have
[02:00:34.240 --> 02:00:37.320]  the money the power there a lot of them are mentally ill their inbred that's
[02:00:37.320 --> 02:00:42.280]  admitted they hate themselves that's why they say humanity is ugly and bad and
[02:00:42.280 --> 02:00:45.720]  fallen and that we have to get rid of humanity and transcend to some new
[02:00:45.720 --> 02:00:50.440]  creature but first we have to all be wired into it it's about control it's
[02:00:50.440 --> 02:00:55.320]  about evil but most of the mid-level people that go along with this plan do
[02:00:55.320 --> 02:00:58.840]  it because they hate themselves and they're projecting it onto the rest of
[02:00:58.840 --> 02:01:05.160]  us is that an accurate statement John Rappaport yes they hate themselves at
[02:01:05.160 --> 02:01:09.760]  the highest level and they always have because they see something that's
[02:01:09.760 --> 02:01:14.400]  totally inauthentic about themselves they don't have any real life force they
[02:01:14.400 --> 02:01:18.800]  don't have any of the kind of ambition that an individual that's free and
[02:01:18.800 --> 02:01:22.840]  independent has now I want to do something in my life and this is what I
[02:01:22.840 --> 02:01:27.760]  want to do and I'm all in and it's fantastic and I wake up every morning
[02:01:27.760 --> 02:01:32.640]  and I want to keep pushing it and it's great no their whole thing becomes I
[02:01:32.640 --> 02:01:37.440]  wake up in the morning thinking about how many more people I can control why
[02:01:37.440 --> 02:01:41.200]  is that because they hate themselves because they don't see anything when
[02:01:41.200 --> 02:01:48.160]  they look inside they see no life force of their own they're totally removed
[02:01:48.160 --> 02:01:53.960]  vampiric like they're abstracted from all that somehow and that's why they hate
[02:01:53.960 --> 02:01:59.480]  themselves they're like dried out prunes that have no lifeless and is that
[02:01:59.480 --> 02:02:02.440]  projection go on to the earth because they seem to hate it even more than us
[02:02:02.440 --> 02:02:07.480]  yeah yeah exactly while they crow about you know let's bring the earth back and
[02:02:07.480 --> 02:02:10.720]  the radical environmentalist movement and all that that's just a mask and a
[02:02:10.720 --> 02:02:16.320]  smoke screen behind that what's really happening is they want to you know just
[02:02:16.320 --> 02:02:22.000]  destroy that that's that's all they've got left they got nothing left but that
[02:02:22.000 --> 02:02:27.720]  and you had a guest on I can't remember who it was was a few months ago and he
[02:02:27.720 --> 02:02:31.640]  was saying you know I used to think okay they're going to destroy a certain
[02:02:31.640 --> 02:02:37.840]  amount create chaos come in behind that establish order which I believe yes
[02:02:37.840 --> 02:02:42.160]  that's the agenda that's the old pattern whatever he said but I'm beginning
[02:02:42.160 --> 02:02:47.680]  to think that now they've gotten so crazy that they're just all out for total
[02:02:47.680 --> 02:02:54.280]  destruction without any second act that some of them have just gone so far off
[02:02:54.280 --> 02:02:57.280]  the rails that's all they can think and that's why I'm saying there's an evil
[02:02:57.280 --> 02:03:00.840]  force because it's clear oh take over create world government kill 80% of
[02:03:00.840 --> 02:03:04.160]  people and then we'll ascend in me gods well of course once you get to that
[02:03:04.160 --> 02:03:07.240]  point you're not really gonna send in me gods that whole paradigm just gonna
[02:03:07.240 --> 02:03:10.360]  continue and it was Gavin McGinnis saying they just want to blow it all up
[02:03:10.360 --> 02:03:14.200]  period just because they're like through throwing fits at their daddy or
[02:03:14.200 --> 02:03:19.280]  something exactly because and they also kind of see that they're losing but
[02:03:19.280 --> 02:03:23.560]  something's happening now that people are emerging who don't believe what they
[02:03:23.560 --> 02:03:27.760]  say anymore absolutely don't believe it through everything they're doing and
[02:03:27.760 --> 02:03:31.000]  see through everything that they're doing yeah well I've been told this by
[02:03:31.000 --> 02:03:35.800]  major billionaires globalist top people they say that this show and others like
[02:03:35.800 --> 02:03:40.360]  it they actually tune in to get reason to what they're doing because they can't
[02:03:40.360 --> 02:03:43.640]  even figure out what they've done but they find that what we talk about when
[02:03:43.640 --> 02:03:46.600]  you talk about is very profound so there's a reason the elite listen
[02:03:46.600 --> 02:03:51.680]  because they actually get sanity here they figure out what they're actually
[02:03:51.680 --> 02:03:56.440]  doing well if they listen to today's broadcast then they may go out and
[02:03:56.440 --> 02:04:00.840]  commit suicide because what they're actually doing is just complete evil I
[02:04:00.840 --> 02:04:05.000]  mean that's the bottom line on it you know if they had any lives of their own
[02:04:05.000 --> 02:04:09.480]  they would be pretty much minding their own business I mean that's one of the
[02:04:09.480 --> 02:04:14.360]  the signs that you have a life of your own exactly it's not that you just are
[02:04:14.360 --> 02:04:19.640]  shuttered off from the world absolutely not or that you let things go by and you
[02:04:19.640 --> 02:04:24.120]  don't care when the air is poisoned or any of that I'm not saying that but on
[02:04:24.120 --> 02:04:30.560]  some level when it comes to you know social interactions and people that you
[02:04:30.560 --> 02:04:35.240]  you're not meddling in everybody else's meddling is the sign of a tyrant
[02:04:35.240 --> 02:04:39.520]  exactly total meddling I mean when you've got your own full life you can
[02:04:39.520 --> 02:04:43.560]  barely even deal with your own life much less your neighbors right exactly you're
[02:04:43.560 --> 02:04:47.080]  doing what you want to do and you don't need to mind their business powerful
[02:04:47.080 --> 02:04:50.000]  John Rappaport well I'm gonna talk to you in very soon thank you for the time
[02:04:50.000 --> 02:04:53.520]  always very thought-provoking no more fake news calm find his books there
[02:04:53.520 --> 02:04:57.400]  they're amazing we'll be back with Steve Pachinic on what's really happening in
[02:04:57.400 --> 02:05:04.920]  this election Joe Biggs here with info wars.com Matt Lauer will moderate the
[02:05:04.920 --> 02:05:09.520]  first forum between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton on Wednesday September

[02:05:30.000 --> 02:05:36.480]  instead we'll go back to back once again Hillary Clinton is too scared to get on
[02:05:36.480 --> 02:05:41.640]  the same stage as Donald Trump she's a coward where's Hillary she's not in
[02:05:41.640 --> 02:05:46.440]  Louisiana she's not in Mexico she's not on the same stage as Donald Trump
[02:05:46.440 --> 02:05:52.760]  because she's sick she's demented and she can't actually debate she's scared

[02:08:04.760 --> 02:08:11.080]  war it's Alex Jones all right dr. Steve Bachanek is gonna be riding shotgun
[02:08:11.080 --> 02:08:14.000]  with us for most this hour he's got a lot of topics he wants to head on I've
[02:08:14.000 --> 02:08:17.600]  got a bunch of questions for him you take him in some directions we don't go in
[02:08:17.600 --> 02:08:22.480]  sometimes there is so much happening in the world I want to ask Dr. Bachanek
[02:08:22.480 --> 02:08:26.480]  about this article Paul Joseph Watson wrote last week that links to the major
[02:08:26.480 --> 02:08:30.440]  German newspapers German government preparing for civil unrest citizens
[02:08:30.440 --> 02:08:35.360]  panic by food warning of national catastrophe of course a lot of our
[02:08:35.360 --> 02:08:39.080]  financial guests have been saying that the big German banks are in worse shaped
[02:08:39.080 --> 02:08:42.920]  than we were in 2007 2008 and of course a lot of those problems were in Europe
[02:08:42.920 --> 02:08:47.640]  back then as well and this is really turning into a serious situation I want
[02:08:47.640 --> 02:08:50.560]  to get dr. Bachanek's take on Trump going to Mexico and I think a very
[02:08:50.560 --> 02:08:54.040]  powerful speech about nationalism and our country's actually working together
[02:08:54.040 --> 02:08:58.680]  and not just being eluded with one-sided trade deals but also very
[02:08:58.680 --> 02:09:05.120]  nationalistic but also conciliatory I want to talk about an article he's
[02:09:05.120 --> 02:09:11.120]  written at Steve Bachanek dot com Tim Kane liar Jesuit CIA operative with
[02:09:11.120 --> 02:09:15.760]  dark past because a lot of people been saying Hillary's clearly very very ill
[02:09:15.760 --> 02:09:19.560]  and dr. Bachanek was here about three weeks ago and he said it needs to be a
[02:09:19.560 --> 02:09:27.000]  board you know certified group of brain surgeons a neurologist pathologist to
[02:09:27.000 --> 02:09:31.760]  look at her since then Obama's former doctor went on CNN and said the same
[02:09:31.760 --> 02:09:37.040]  thing who's a Democrat by the way dr. Drew basically came out and said she
[02:09:37.040 --> 02:09:42.500]  looks really sick and she's taking this armored thyroid and Cuma then that you
[02:09:42.500 --> 02:09:46.240]  take those together that is just crazy he said I just need to talk to her he
[02:09:46.240 --> 02:09:52.640]  was very loving about it fired five days later with a popular show people
[02:09:52.640 --> 02:09:56.040]  that were Trump shirts on TV that are guests are having a blurred out I mean
[02:09:56.040 --> 02:10:01.040]  they are I'm surprised as the head of WikiLeaks said yesterday and played the
[02:10:01.040 --> 02:10:06.880]  clip Julian Assange that the press climate is the old corporate media is is
[02:10:06.880 --> 02:10:14.040]  lying lockstep and enthusiastically cheerleading disinformation at a foam at
[02:10:14.040 --> 02:10:17.360]  the mouth level that I don't think I've ever seen even in other countries I
[02:10:17.360 --> 02:10:21.040]  mean even other big corrupt countries that are under authoritarianism people
[02:10:21.040 --> 02:10:27.320]  kind of begrudgingly write the BS this is like mind control or something I is
[02:10:27.320 --> 02:10:30.080]  this because they're weaker because they're strong I mean they are pulling
[02:10:30.080 --> 02:10:34.880]  out all the stops so that's a lot of issues to cover there a lot of things
[02:10:34.880 --> 02:10:40.280]  to get into but reason I got into Hillary's health is exactly what dr.
[02:10:40.280 --> 02:10:44.600]  Pachennick said was almost up a talking point then the next few days that was
[02:10:44.600 --> 02:10:48.360]  repeated everywhere by other doctors and folks that I guess we're just looking at
[02:10:48.360 --> 02:10:56.560]  the same information but then we have to look closer at her VP mr. Cain because I
[02:10:56.560 --> 02:11:02.000]  don't really just judge it booked by its cover but he looks like a power-hungry
[02:11:02.000 --> 02:11:06.040]  candy asked me then I researched his background total establishment Wall
[02:11:06.040 --> 02:11:10.160]  Street I love Wall Street but not the bad corrupt centralized groups he's run by
[02:11:10.160 --> 02:11:14.280]  the nastiest big corporate groups just like Hillary is those groups all
[02:11:14.280 --> 02:11:16.920]  completely scared of Donald Trump which ought to be the reason he should be
[02:11:16.920 --> 02:11:21.200]  elected for everybody that claims their anti-establishment he also worked with
[02:11:21.200 --> 02:11:24.840]  communists and stuff he's just really nasty the reason Cain and the Negra
[02:11:24.840 --> 02:11:28.920]  Ponte were in Honduras at the same time I was doing the devil's work was to
[02:11:28.920 --> 02:11:34.880]  create a illegal army and then it goes on through all of that show show there's a
[02:11:34.880 --> 02:11:40.480]  lot of stuff going on and a lot of different angles to this but do they
[02:11:40.480 --> 02:11:45.160]  know she has a brain tumor we know that Ted Kennedy had a brain tumor and lived
[02:11:45.160 --> 02:11:48.960]  a year or so with it and from a lot of the doctors I've talked to including
[02:11:48.960 --> 02:11:52.840]  Pachennick they say a lot of the time in the hospital for a year this isn't just
[02:11:52.840 --> 02:11:56.600]  a blood clot and the type of drugs she was given the things that are going on it
[02:11:56.600 --> 02:12:00.840]  would be in association with a tumor being removed and I talked to some
[02:12:00.840 --> 02:12:04.680]  sources obviously and they said well we don't know what it is but it's serious
[02:12:04.680 --> 02:12:10.120]  and the rumor is it's a tumor whatever it is she looks really bad when she came
[02:12:10.120 --> 02:12:15.240]  out last week and attackers truly and others and and twisted things I've said
[02:12:15.240 --> 02:12:18.920]  lied about things said some things that were true but but really lied about you
[02:12:18.920 --> 02:12:22.000]  know Steven Bannon and people but I'm not and Donald Trump I mean she really
[02:12:22.000 --> 02:12:27.560]  lied about them she didn't look well there but then she calls into most of
[02:12:27.560 --> 02:12:31.000]  the shows now she can't do press conferences this is quite a cornucopia
[02:12:31.000 --> 02:12:34.840]  here doctor but I want to bam bam bam bam bam through this with you thanks
[02:12:34.840 --> 02:12:39.640]  for joining us oh it's a pleasure but I want to congratulate you Alex and your
[02:12:39.640 --> 02:12:45.200]  audience because she reaffirmed the importance of the Alex Jones show I
[02:12:45.200 --> 02:12:52.000]  have never in 30 years of my life heard an opposition give credence to the so
[02:12:52.000 --> 02:12:57.240]  called the truthers the conspiracy so we are now the main line and I want to
[02:12:57.240 --> 02:13:01.520]  thank you and I want to thank everyone else but let's get to our health there's
[02:13:01.520 --> 02:13:05.440]  no question she has a health problem I don't want to go too much into detail
[02:13:05.440 --> 02:13:10.160]  other than what I already said she has a real problem central venus thombosis as
[02:13:10.160 --> 02:13:14.800]  Dr. Drew said and others have said it is a serious serious problem both in
[02:13:14.800 --> 02:13:19.880]  coagulation and neurological damage but I want to go to the next element which I
[02:13:19.880 --> 02:13:25.600]  wanted to really examine once I had her I began to ask myself the same question
[02:13:25.600 --> 02:13:30.560]  that you asked yourself and everybody else had who was Tim Cain and I started
[02:13:30.560 --> 02:13:34.920]  listening to him now from my past experience I want everybody to know
[02:13:34.920 --> 02:13:40.800]  I'm not anti-catholic half my family's Catholic I have treated Jesuits now when
[02:13:40.800 --> 02:13:45.520]  I said I've treated Jesuits I've treated Jesuits on behalf of the church and on
[02:13:45.520 --> 02:13:50.560]  behalf of some three-letter organizations I will not announce who they are but you
[02:13:50.560 --> 02:13:56.760]  can get guess it when I heard him speak I immediately realized that he was to a
[02:13:56.760 --> 02:14:04.000]  feet to a bombastic in a way that was disingenuous everything he said was
[02:14:04.000 --> 02:14:09.560]  that I was inspired by the poor people of Honduras I lived in the mud hut I mean
[02:14:09.560 --> 02:14:16.040]  it was everything short of debasing himself in front of the church and in
[02:14:16.040 --> 02:14:21.400]  fact what happened is when I went back to my records and my sources I found out
[02:14:21.400 --> 02:14:27.120]  that number one he lived in a very high sophisticated compound which had swimming
[02:14:27.120 --> 02:14:32.320]  pools golf courses he was under security he was guarded he had been
[02:14:32.320 --> 02:14:36.460]  affiliated with the CIA not only sure he pushes this narrative that he goes to
[02:14:36.460 --> 02:14:40.040]  black churches in America and helps the poor and all this and it's all a
[02:14:40.040 --> 02:14:44.720]  complete cut out a classic Jesuit program well it is the classical I mean
[02:14:44.720 --> 02:14:49.680]  what he does is like any sociopath they combine a lot of lies with some truth
[02:14:49.680 --> 02:14:54.200]  sure he probably went to a few Catholic a few black churches in Virginia there
[02:14:54.200 --> 02:14:59.400]  are a lot of them but had he literally worked in Honduras to help the poor
[02:14:59.400 --> 02:15:03.920]  people no he was involved in developing the contrast the one reason I know this
[02:15:03.920 --> 02:15:08.640]  quite well as general noriega when I flew into Honduras and then Panama told
[02:15:08.640 --> 02:15:13.440]  me about the entire cocaine scheme where and I have a lot of respect for the
[02:15:13.440 --> 02:15:17.640]  ambassador of Honduras who was ambassador of Negro Ponte who was also
[02:15:17.640 --> 02:15:21.880]  affiliated with our intelligence service and one of the top ambassadors and
[02:15:21.880 --> 02:15:26.000]  intelligence operatives but when you work with Negro Ponte you're not on the
[02:15:26.000 --> 02:15:30.720]  side of the Lord you are on the side of the devil that allows us to build up the
[02:15:30.720 --> 02:15:36.560]  contrast against the Sandinistas so does that mean Tim Cain is a is an
[02:15:36.560 --> 02:15:40.960]  effective operative no what it means is he uses his past
[02:15:40.960 --> 02:15:46.640]  confabulates and then uses his religion to manipulate the people and get to power
[02:15:46.640 --> 02:15:52.480]  you would think this was the holy angel who came and gave us benefit beneficence
[02:15:52.480 --> 02:15:57.640]  in fact he's not like many of the Jesuits they were supported and funded by
[02:15:57.640 --> 02:16:03.360]  United Fruit Company which is the front and a cutout for the CIA so he liked
[02:16:03.360 --> 02:16:08.760]  the Jesuits who won't admit it have been part and parcel of the CIA programs sure
[02:16:08.760 --> 02:16:11.760]  they go around even stirring up the communist movements then rounding them
[02:16:11.760 --> 02:16:15.200]  up controlling the whole paradigm which isn't that the Jesuit specialty is 360
[02:16:15.200 --> 02:16:19.560]  control sitting in every political point of the compass but let's go further I
[02:16:19.560 --> 02:16:22.720]  mean the Jesuits obviously historically aren't supposed to be Pope we've got this
[02:16:22.720 --> 02:16:27.280]  new Pope coming in pushing global government going after Trump doing all
[02:16:27.280 --> 02:16:30.720]  these things lecturing everyone about carbon indulgences and then now you've
[02:16:30.720 --> 02:16:35.680]  got this Jesuit VP with Hillary looking like she's not long for this world we
[02:16:35.680 --> 02:16:40.040]  better look into this are we seeing a global Jesuit offensive even the
[02:16:40.040 --> 02:16:44.720]  London Guardian admitted let me tell you why Alex first of all I've talked about
[02:16:44.720 --> 02:16:52.440]  the Pope Francis for over a year now I've known the Pope in the late 1970s and
[02:16:52.440 --> 02:16:58.040]  early 80s when he was the director of the Jesuits in Argentina under the
[02:16:58.040 --> 02:17:03.840]  military coup he had allowed several Jezebists to be killed as well as four
[02:17:03.840 --> 02:17:09.440]  nuns to be assassinated by the military coup so once again what we have here is
[02:17:09.440 --> 02:17:15.000]  not a unified entity the Pope is not relevant to our political destiny he's
[02:17:15.000 --> 02:17:18.400]  not even relevant no I understand but they admit that it was blackmail that
[02:17:18.400 --> 02:17:22.640]  helped them install him correct that is correct so what you get here in a
[02:17:22.640 --> 02:17:28.200]  unified front is not that their powers effective it's not it's it's what you're
[02:17:28.200 --> 02:17:33.200]  getting is constant lies that are being used to bring in a lot of I get it so
[02:17:33.200 --> 02:17:36.360]  they can fight over the power structure they've got that's rotting but they're
[02:17:36.360 --> 02:17:41.120]  not taking over the larger and the key point that you brought out is the press
[02:17:41.120 --> 02:17:45.520]  really getting more powerful is Hillary getting more powerful no I think you
[02:17:45.520 --> 02:17:49.520]  brought up the point that if the press gets more desperate and in fact thank
[02:17:49.520 --> 02:17:54.480]  God you were named as Alex Jones what's happening is that they the press is
[02:17:54.480 --> 02:18:01.320]  finding themselves to be totally eunuchs ineffectual and the reason for that is
[02:18:01.320 --> 02:18:07.440]  they don't have an audience as you know CNN has gone from 600,000 at the lowest
[02:18:07.440 --> 02:18:12.720]  end back down to 400,000 viewers per episode and the only time they get a
[02:18:12.720 --> 02:18:18.120]  higher amount is when Trump comes up but the key here is that even if we were to
[02:18:18.120 --> 02:18:24.000]  a boycott all of the sponsors of CNN it wouldn't make a difference because of
[02:18:24.000 --> 02:18:30.120]  the way the law is structured by the FCC that allows CNN which is a dead
[02:18:30.120 --> 02:18:35.280]  outfit to basically receive money from all of our cable inputs that's right so
[02:18:35.280 --> 02:18:38.880]  people don't know about the carriage rights and all the rest of it but but
[02:18:38.880 --> 02:18:43.000]  but CNN is a parasite so is MSNBC because they've been there so long with the
[02:18:43.000 --> 02:18:46.680]  carrying carriage rights that they get part of your cable bill folks even though
[02:18:46.680 --> 02:18:51.680]  you don't watch it I think you have to reemphasize that because again this is
[02:18:51.680 --> 02:18:57.280]  an this is an example where no matter how much we protest and we discard it and
[02:18:57.280 --> 02:19:01.200]  we want to avoid these sponsors they just leave it up as a facade to make us
[02:19:01.200 --> 02:19:05.800]  think we're not winning correct but in fact we are winning and the point of
[02:19:05.800 --> 02:19:10.560]  fact is if we were to dis disconnect all of the cables and cut them through
[02:19:10.560 --> 02:19:14.640]  eventually the cable companies would understand that they no longer can
[02:19:14.640 --> 02:19:19.000]  afford to pay ex-cathedra the amount so what you're saying is they're already
[02:19:19.000 --> 02:19:21.760]  dead they know they're dead but now they're gonna strike back let's want to
[02:19:21.760 --> 02:19:24.800]  ask you next we want to break sir they're openly announcing all these new
[02:19:24.800 --> 02:19:30.680]  terms of service Chinese style web IDs for for what your social standing is to
[02:19:30.680 --> 02:19:35.040]  economically impact you negatively if you don't submit the system open
[02:19:35.040 --> 02:19:37.640]  announcements of wanting to censor the internet I don't think it's gonna work
[02:19:37.640 --> 02:19:41.280]  I think it's gonna backfire but I want to ask you who wrote net force with Tom
[02:19:41.280 --> 02:19:45.880]  Clancy and more and predicted so much of this what would happen Dr. Steve

[02:24:34.920 --> 02:24:40.920]  for several years George Soros is heavily involved
[02:24:40.920 --> 02:24:45.640]  that George Soros has been heavily heavily heavily heavily involved in trying
[02:24:45.640 --> 02:24:52.840]  to take over the internet in free speech and here's our report from Monday where
[02:24:52.840 --> 02:24:56.720]  we broke it down you guys go back to what we just had on screen I can show TV
[02:24:56.720 --> 02:25:06.840]  viewers UN and Soros plan to take over the web now today it's up on bright
[02:25:06.840 --> 02:25:12.040]  bar but look breaking UN George Soros to take over the internet as alternative
[02:25:12.040 --> 02:25:16.880]  media can use the rise the elite prepare to shut it down that's August 30th from
[02:25:16.880 --> 02:25:22.240]  August 29th on the live show and the only reason I show you that again is not
[02:25:22.240 --> 02:25:27.320]  two-door horns but they're after us because we go read the documents we know
[02:25:27.320 --> 02:25:31.240]  their plan we know what they're up to leaked memos Soros Foundation I'd
[02:25:31.240 --> 02:25:37.600]  stronger internet regulation in TPP negotiations and it goes further than that
[02:25:37.600 --> 02:25:44.760]  he wants it scripted in the memos to where his organizations get the traffic
[02:25:44.760 --> 02:25:50.120]  and we're not even allowed to get it it's redlinked on drudgereport.com but
[02:25:50.120 --> 02:25:53.160]  now we go to dr. Steve Pachennick this is a short segment long segment coming up
[02:25:53.160 --> 02:25:56.640]  doc as an information warfare guy yourself former head of psychological
[02:25:56.640 --> 02:26:00.720]  warfare at the State Department what would you expect them knowing their
[02:26:00.720 --> 02:26:05.520]  modus operandi to do now that corporate media is imploded repeater media is
[02:26:05.520 --> 02:26:09.680]  imploded they're intensifying propaganda it's not working they're going crazy
[02:26:09.680 --> 02:26:13.960]  they're openly trying to say let's arrest global warming deniers let's take
[02:26:13.960 --> 02:26:19.920]  over the internet Hillary emails say that say that you know bright Barton and
[02:26:19.920 --> 02:26:25.360]  alt right has no right to exist I mean this is final solution talk what do you
[02:26:25.360 --> 02:26:30.560]  think's being bounced around that we don't know about well I think what you're seeing
[02:26:30.560 --> 02:26:37.360]  happening is the complete desperation of a very ineffectual system when you
[02:26:37.360 --> 02:26:42.200]  talk about George Soros I've met him and I've seen him at the Council on
[02:26:42.200 --> 02:26:46.320]  Foreign Relations relations he's antiquated I mean you really talking
[02:26:46.320 --> 02:26:50.600]  of the past he can put all the money he wants and and he's actually not that
[02:26:50.600 --> 02:26:54.800]  brilliant this is one of the few Jews what we call a euthanite who worked with
[02:26:54.800 --> 02:27:00.280]  the Nazis and he knows that once you have that kind of backup system once you
[02:27:00.280 --> 02:27:03.800]  have the corruption of the Clinton Foundation once you have the corruption
[02:27:03.800 --> 02:27:08.680]  of the media the corruption of the Department of Justice and FBI we have
[02:27:08.680 --> 02:27:13.640]  an effect that de facto state of revolution without having to go to guns
[02:27:13.640 --> 02:27:17.880]  and without having to go so we go back to your soft coup that took place four
[02:27:17.880 --> 02:27:22.240]  years ago where are we now but this is this is exactly what you and I used to
[02:27:22.240 --> 02:27:27.040]  talk about and you would kind of warn me correctly but this is the revolution
[02:27:27.040 --> 02:27:31.760]  that we talked about it is an amazing revolution which you know in part I
[02:27:31.760 --> 02:27:36.760]  kind of predicted a net force would happen 30 years ago through the Internet
[02:27:36.760 --> 02:27:42.080]  and through somebody like an Alex Jones who was able to articulate what the
[02:27:42.080 --> 02:27:47.720]  reality was and then that reality would be attempted to be distorted change
[02:27:47.720 --> 02:27:54.480]  muted but never once will they touch you Alice I can assure you of one thing no
[02:27:54.480 --> 02:27:57.800]  one will tell you even tell me that for 15 years and it's been true so far how
[02:27:57.800 --> 02:28:02.640]  do you know that touching you because I'll tell you why as much as you and I
[02:28:02.640 --> 02:28:08.680]  may hit the system the system being the internal security of our military and
[02:28:08.680 --> 02:28:13.600]  intelligence forces there are many who are with us who cannot say that they're
[02:28:13.600 --> 02:28:18.760]  with us openly there many of us many of them who say to me go on they've never
[02:28:18.760 --> 02:28:23.520]  seen me and they recognize me from my voice or they recognize me for my
[02:28:23.520 --> 02:28:29.600]  presence on Alex Jones but the truth of the matter is America is now in a new
[02:28:29.600 --> 02:28:34.440]  kind of revolution the Clintons don't get it Soros doesn't get it the CFR
[02:28:34.440 --> 02:28:40.880]  doesn't get it Brandon Bannon gets it Trump gets it Brett Bart gets it you
[02:28:40.880 --> 02:28:46.360]  get it and what happened is without gloating about it you have succeeded
[02:28:46.360 --> 02:28:49.720]  and we succeeded our listeners have I mean absolutely drudge has been right at
[02:28:49.720 --> 02:28:53.320]  the center of it and it's not about credit it's about understanding where we
[02:28:53.320 --> 02:28:57.320]  are to gauge it so this is definitely happening and they now admit they're in
[02:28:57.320 --> 02:28:59.620]  deep trouble and hate the narrative we're putting out because it's it's
[02:28:59.620 --> 02:29:03.360]  accurate we're going to break in one minute how do you expect them to counter
[02:29:03.360 --> 02:29:07.160]  it then well they're going to counter if they're very limited in there in their
[02:29:07.160 --> 02:29:11.960]  panoply of of choices in other words they don't know exactly what they can do
[02:29:11.960 --> 02:29:18.160]  they can be they can be deflate us they can be legitimize represent on that
[02:29:18.160 --> 02:29:22.800]  with Hillary saying oh my god he talked about he being Alex Jones talked about
[02:29:22.800 --> 02:29:26.040]  Sandy Hook as a false flag would you and I know that it's a false flag
[02:29:26.040 --> 02:29:30.480]  millions of people know that James let's talk about that we come back that was
[02:29:30.480 --> 02:29:36.560]  next had to go to court so the issue is they can no longer appeal to the audience
[02:29:36.560 --> 02:29:41.600]  that is now well-versed in the internet the reality or what we call the
[02:29:41.600 --> 02:29:44.960]  alternative that's right stay there doc you're absolutely right it's not in force
[02:29:44.960 --> 02:29:48.200]  it's not drudge it's not chenic it's that we're all just manifestations of
[02:29:48.200 --> 02:29:53.840]  people that know the score we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones
[02:29:53.840 --> 02:29:57.800]  and the GCN radio network

[02:33:00.080 --> 02:33:02.080]  ah
[02:33:02.080 --> 02:33:19.960]  ah defend the republic from enemies foreign and domestic it's Alex Jones
[02:33:19.960 --> 02:33:35.900]  Look, it is surreal. I don't want to be gonzojournalism. It's not about sitting here and talking about
[02:33:35.900 --> 02:33:39.260]  ourselves and saying we're having this big effect. But the listeners need to understand
[02:33:39.260 --> 02:33:44.120]  that what Dr. Pachennick was just talking about, that they're going to have big trouble
[02:33:44.120 --> 02:33:50.760]  moving against the liberty movement, whether it's Matt Drudge or Stephen Bannon or myself,
[02:33:50.760 --> 02:33:54.720]  because when you get into the actual groups and organizations and people that actually
[02:33:54.720 --> 02:34:00.240]  do the targeted killing, as it's called, they're almost all our listeners. And I'm not going
[02:34:00.240 --> 02:34:06.200]  to get into inside baseball, but you name a general of the last 10, 15 years that ran
[02:34:06.200 --> 02:34:12.480]  sideways with Obama or even Bush, and they're dialed in. And the military itself, I don't
[02:34:12.480 --> 02:34:17.040]  mean some new cadet or some new, you know, private in the army or something, but I mean
[02:34:17.040 --> 02:34:21.960]  people that have been in combat, been involved and everything, they've got the big picture.
[02:34:21.960 --> 02:34:26.880]  And we were just one part of decompartmentalizing that now because these people are on the inside
[02:34:26.880 --> 02:34:32.760]  and the outside, now that they've already got the accurate narrative, they're adding
[02:34:32.760 --> 02:34:38.800]  more to the narrative than we even add now. And so the battle space is getting very, very
[02:34:38.800 --> 02:34:43.920]  clear and the growth curve has now spilt into the police departments, who we've been big
[02:34:43.920 --> 02:34:48.080]  critics of the problems and the federalization and constitutional abuses. But the point is
[02:34:48.080 --> 02:34:56.480]  the police now are ridiculously awake. And so as this growth curve, almost like a virus
[02:34:56.480 --> 02:35:00.480]  spreading but a good virus grows, I don't see how they put it back together again. I'm
[02:35:00.480 --> 02:35:05.880]  not trying to be too positive, okay? I'm not trying to be too positive on the face of this,
[02:35:05.880 --> 02:35:15.040]  but when you experience the things I've experienced, it's incredible. And again, I don't lionize
[02:35:15.040 --> 02:35:18.680]  all the veterans, I don't lionize current people in the military, I don't lionize the
[02:35:18.680 --> 02:35:23.240]  secret service, got some problems or local police or whoever, but you can't ignore the
[02:35:23.240 --> 02:35:27.840]  radar ping when you've even been a critic of the police state, but because you're against
[02:35:27.840 --> 02:35:32.760]  George Soros and the destabilization campaign and the overthrow of the country, that whether
[02:35:32.760 --> 02:35:40.160]  it's state police in Ohio or whether it's the secret service or whether it's war heroes,
[02:35:40.160 --> 02:35:47.000]  you name it, people that have been in the military for decades, famous in those circles
[02:35:47.000 --> 02:35:51.200]  and they are huge listeners and tell you basically everybody else is, that is a major radar
[02:35:51.200 --> 02:35:57.880]  ping on the fact that the mainstream media kept pretending like it was the only game
[02:35:57.880 --> 02:36:03.280]  in town shoveling BS at people, it lost all credibility, it demonized this, all it did
[02:36:03.280 --> 02:36:07.960]  was send more people here and now they've got this huge problem on their hands because
[02:36:07.960 --> 02:36:12.400]  this information is proliferating and I don't see what they do, Dr. Bochenik, I mean, I
[02:36:12.400 --> 02:36:16.600]  know I'm kind of belaboring that, but it's really the big news that they are in trouble
[02:36:16.600 --> 02:36:21.680]  and when Hillary was talking about our liberty movement, our Americana movement, she looked
[02:36:21.680 --> 02:36:26.760]  legitimately really pissed and like she was being forced to eat rotten meat. I mean,
[02:36:26.760 --> 02:36:31.040]  as a psychiatrist looking at her in that speech last week, her alt-right speech, her most
[02:36:31.040 --> 02:36:36.280]  important speech, she said, what did you garner from it and the script of my dark heart and
[02:36:36.280 --> 02:36:39.400]  all this? What is your view as a psychological warfare expert?
[02:36:39.400 --> 02:36:46.640]  Well, my view is now we have to be exceedingly careful because we've wounded the lion and
[02:36:46.640 --> 02:36:53.040]  the lion is wounded and will strike out. The lion will not strike out against us again
[02:36:53.040 --> 02:36:59.280]  on the media because they find that that was not effective and in effect what they did
[02:36:59.280 --> 02:37:06.640]  was to really raise your profile and drudge and bannins and the others so that they either
[02:37:06.640 --> 02:37:12.920]  understood that or didn't understand it. If I were they, then they would have to go around
[02:37:12.920 --> 02:37:19.320]  with their huge connections and they've compromised so many people, including the director of
[02:37:19.320 --> 02:37:26.600]  the FBI, Loretta Lynch, the FBI itself, the Secret Service. I mean, most of those institutions
[02:37:26.600 --> 02:37:34.720]  are so highly compromised and what they're going to do is going to the ballot box, which
[02:37:34.720 --> 02:37:40.880]  is what you said many weeks ago and that is we have to monitor the ballot boxes to make
[02:37:40.880 --> 02:37:51.480]  sure that there isn't anything going on like George Bush and Bush Jr. and Jeb because they're
[02:37:51.480 --> 02:37:57.520]  tied together. The Bush and the Clinton families are tied together. All of these families are
[02:37:57.520 --> 02:38:05.920]  tied together. What's happening in effect, if we have disintegrated this incredible lattice
[02:38:05.920 --> 02:38:14.040]  of corruption and instability and put in place a totally different game, now you see Obama,
[02:38:14.040 --> 02:38:19.120]  he's nowhere to be found. I mean, he's in China. Do we really need him in China? No.
[02:38:19.120 --> 02:38:23.280]  Has he accomplished anything in eight years? I said from the day he came in he would do
[02:38:23.280 --> 02:38:29.680]  nothing, he would lie and he would be ineffectual and in fact we've had more false flags with
[02:38:29.680 --> 02:38:35.800]  Obama than anyone else. Now we're going to have Hillary. She may pull a false flag again.
[02:38:35.800 --> 02:38:43.000]  Another type of a false flag and in turn try to divert the attention away from the conversation
[02:38:43.000 --> 02:38:49.640]  and the narrative to make it look as if we have another problem, either a terrorist problem
[02:38:49.640 --> 02:38:56.880]  or a crisis in the government or some crisis overseas. Right now we're in a position where
[02:38:56.880 --> 02:39:04.480]  the next couple of weeks she has been isolated for such a long time that in effect she's
[02:39:04.480 --> 02:39:11.320]  in a bubble and that bubble has reinforcement from the people around them. Huma Abedin and
[02:39:11.320 --> 02:39:16.680]  all of the other people, Jake Sullivan, none of them are really that effective or that
[02:39:16.680 --> 02:39:20.960]  smart in national security or in psychological operation.
[02:39:20.960 --> 02:39:24.160]  Well, let me raise this serve and then I want to play a clip for you. I'm sure you've seen
[02:39:24.160 --> 02:39:28.440]  it. Have you seen the clip of her a few weeks ago in Reno when a woman like 50 feet away
[02:39:28.440 --> 02:39:32.800]  just yells about animal rights and Hillary looks like an insane bag lady.
[02:39:32.800 --> 02:39:34.560]  No, I hadn't. I hadn't seen it.
[02:39:34.560 --> 02:39:38.320]  And then the doctor, the black doctor with the EpiPen runs up and goes, it's okay. It's
[02:39:38.320 --> 02:39:39.320]  all right.
[02:39:39.320 --> 02:39:40.320]  All right, that one. That's correct.
[02:39:40.320 --> 02:39:45.160]  Well, let's play this clip because as a psychiatrist looking at this, I mean, I'm a lay person,
[02:39:45.160 --> 02:39:49.280]  but she clearly goes out of it for a minute. Like when you've got, you know, a 90-something
[02:39:49.280 --> 02:39:54.000]  year old grandmother, she goes out of it and then comes back. I mean, it clearly, she looks
[02:39:54.000 --> 02:39:56.880]  like the definition of a loon. Let's play the clip.
[02:39:56.880 --> 02:40:14.280]  Keep talking. You're okay. Of course, there's hundreds of these clips, but she's got a handler
[02:40:14.280 --> 02:40:18.440]  there that brings her back to reality. She looks like she's about to fall down until
[02:40:18.440 --> 02:40:24.240]  I remember that. I have seen it, but remember, let's not focus on the specific point anymore.
[02:40:24.240 --> 02:40:30.640]  The issue of her health, mental health and physical health has come out loud and clear.
[02:40:30.640 --> 02:40:36.960]  They understand that they have to keep her isolated and insulated. In contrast, you hear
[02:40:36.960 --> 02:40:42.000]  Trump going, I mean, it was really quite a coup for him to go down to Mexico, but more
[02:40:42.000 --> 02:40:48.400]  importantly, he went down with my tents to Louisiana. Even the president of the United
[02:40:48.400 --> 02:40:55.680]  States didn't have enough intelligence or enough even optics to understand that it was
[02:40:55.680 --> 02:40:59.880]  important for him to go down to Louisiana. Hillary didn't go either. What does that say?
[02:40:59.880 --> 02:41:05.000]  No, no, no, no. Hillary is totally isolated. She's non-functional. What she's functional
[02:41:05.000 --> 02:41:10.600]  on is to raise money internally, which means basically, help me, help me. She's in a highly
[02:41:10.600 --> 02:41:14.600]  So she's a figurehead. They roll around in a jar like Dredge said.
[02:41:14.600 --> 02:41:20.480]  Correct. She is highly, probably more immobilized than people realize. They're trying to feed
[02:41:20.480 --> 02:41:26.800]  her improper up. The real issue now isn't Hillary as much as it is the entire movement
[02:41:26.800 --> 02:41:32.800]  represented by the Clinton Bush Foundation and all the other elements, including, you
[02:41:32.800 --> 02:41:39.400]  know, Payne and including the FBI, Calmy and Loretta Lynch. They all have to go and they
[02:41:39.400 --> 02:41:48.400]  will go. The point of fact now is for Trump to have a team that is quite strong in domestic
[02:41:48.400 --> 02:41:54.760]  policies and in foreign policy. If he can announce that team and bring it out and make
[02:41:54.760 --> 02:42:01.040]  sure that they're well vetted because that's one of the key elements, then he gets ahead
[02:42:01.040 --> 02:42:02.040]  of the game.
[02:42:02.040 --> 02:42:05.760]  By the way, let me ask you this question. Trump is so dialed in that the day he flew
[02:42:05.760 --> 02:42:10.000]  down there. I know he didn't hear this from me. I was saying, no one knows what's going
[02:42:10.000 --> 02:42:12.960]  to be in his private talk with the Mexican president, but I'd say, let's work together
[02:42:12.960 --> 02:42:18.320]  as our economies. Let's do good deals. Let's not like globalism screw us over anymore.
[02:42:18.320 --> 02:42:22.120]  And then it turns out that's what he says to the president and reportedly the president
[02:42:22.120 --> 02:42:26.360]  came out with a good body language and then later said nice things. And now, you know,
[02:42:26.360 --> 02:42:30.480]  Trump says it really went well. I mean, that is very presidential that Trump's so dialed
[02:42:30.480 --> 02:42:37.000]  in on such the patriot page that he's just doing everything right.
[02:42:37.000 --> 02:42:43.640]  That's correct. But now he has to continue that the debates will determine only one part
[02:42:43.640 --> 02:42:51.160]  of the final solution as you call it. The real concern I have is that the voting machinery
[02:42:51.160 --> 02:42:58.680]  and the voting software has to be monitored by our people and has to really be evaluated
[02:42:58.680 --> 02:43:04.680]  as to what happens. It's the old Stalin routine. He can say, I don't care who votes and how
[02:43:04.680 --> 02:43:10.080]  many times you vote, I care who controls the voting machinery. And that's really where
[02:43:10.080 --> 02:43:15.600]  we are now with the Clintons because they will do whatever they need to do to get her
[02:43:15.600 --> 02:43:22.000]  in there. And then once they get her in there, then the entire team of cockroaches just moves
[02:43:22.000 --> 02:43:29.160]  in and it'll be a repetition of Bill Clinton and Obama. And once again, Hillary does not
[02:43:29.160 --> 02:43:34.960]  have a very impressive team. They just not. It has nothing to do with Democrats or not.
[02:43:34.960 --> 02:43:39.960]  But won't she be compromised by all these foreign powers from the Saudis to the Chinese
[02:43:39.960 --> 02:43:43.400]  that have been buying her and selling her like a cheap prostitute?
[02:43:43.400 --> 02:43:49.840]  Correct. And she and Bill have been so compromised by the Chinese all the way back when I was
[02:43:49.840 --> 02:43:57.440]  in the senior administration and the Chinese were buying off Tyson's chicken, Perdue,
[02:43:57.440 --> 02:44:03.760]  Walmart and Bill. And that was part of their own plan. The Chinese have come in with billions
[02:44:03.760 --> 02:44:09.760]  of dollars. She's been bought off. The Saudis have had her. The point of fact now is that
[02:44:09.760 --> 02:44:15.680]  we can literally impede that by literally saying, why has good parts of the government
[02:44:15.680 --> 02:44:21.600]  allowed the president and his co-president to become basically a five dollar whore that's
[02:44:21.600 --> 02:44:26.280]  passed around by foreign governments? I mean, that just sounds the old concept of the pension.
[02:44:26.280 --> 02:44:32.680]  When I asked a lot of my people that I knew in the CIA and in other intelligence organizations,
[02:44:32.680 --> 02:44:39.320]  why did you allow 9 11 to occur? And the answer from two of my friends, I can't identify them.
[02:44:39.320 --> 02:44:44.400]  And the CIA said, Steve, it's sad, but they wanted their pensions. And the truth of the
[02:44:44.400 --> 02:44:50.320]  matter is we can no longer have people in the government who have 20 year pensions and up
[02:44:50.320 --> 02:44:56.480]  and out. We will have to reformulate that so that in fact, their contribution to our country
[02:44:56.480 --> 02:44:59.840]  is not dependent. They ought to use their head. You let evil like this in. You're never going
[02:44:59.840 --> 02:45:04.320]  to get your pension to begin with. I'm going to destroy the whole country. Well, the point is,
[02:45:04.320 --> 02:45:12.000]  you know, with a 20 year lead time, I can have all I can buy off so many people that it's unbelievable
[02:45:12.000 --> 02:45:18.160]  in the foreign service and the intelligence service in the end. And now we can no longer afford
[02:45:18.160 --> 02:45:24.960]  that. So when Trump comes in, he has to look at that type of mindset and that type of financial
[02:45:26.000 --> 02:45:29.600]  model. No, I agree with you. Now we got to move quick here. Since you mentioned the Hillary
[02:45:29.600 --> 02:45:34.480]  speech, here's where she attacked yours truly. Now I want to be clear. I have said that clearly
[02:45:34.480 --> 02:45:39.120]  it's a false flag. They've got adults that act like actors, blue screens with Anderson Cooper.
[02:45:39.120 --> 02:45:44.400]  The media never attacks my points because I want them to hit my pieces of proof that Bloomberg
[02:45:44.400 --> 02:45:48.880]  sent an email out the day before activating his gun grips for something big to happen the next day,
[02:45:48.880 --> 02:45:53.440]  that they were all ready, that they got circles of kids going in and out of the building with a guy
[02:45:53.440 --> 02:45:57.520]  and camera was grabbed at the back, but they cover that up. And then they didn't send emergency
[02:45:57.520 --> 02:46:02.000]  choppers and they didn't send ambulances for hours. All this went on. I'm saying it should
[02:46:02.000 --> 02:46:06.560]  be investigated. The whole thing. Now you've said it's a total false flag. My point is,
[02:46:06.560 --> 02:46:10.320]  my point is they just stalled it and say, well, when he says 9 11, he means the firefighters
[02:46:10.320 --> 02:46:13.520]  blew it up. Or when he says Oklahoma City is a false flag, he means, you know, the
[02:46:14.560 --> 02:46:19.360]  little government did it, not criminal elements. Same thing with Sandy Hook. Very suspicious to me,
[02:46:19.360 --> 02:46:24.080]  but you're a smart guy that has run false flags. Obviously you're saying it has all the telltale
[02:46:24.080 --> 02:46:30.080]  signs. I want to get your take on this clip. Here it is. It's also what happens when you listen to
[02:46:30.080 --> 02:46:38.080]  the radio host, Alex Jones, who claims that 9 11 and the Oklahoma City bombings were inside jobs.
[02:46:39.280 --> 02:46:48.400]  He even said, and this really just is so disgusting. He even said the victims of the Sandy Hook
[02:46:48.400 --> 02:46:57.120]  massacre were child actors and no one was actually killed there. I don't know what happens in somebody's
[02:46:57.120 --> 02:47:07.440]  mind or how dark their heart must be to say things like that. But Trump doesn't challenge these lies.
[02:47:07.440 --> 02:47:13.920]  He actually went on Jones's show and said, your reputation is amazing. I will not let you down.
[02:47:15.760 --> 02:47:20.160]  This from the man who wants to be president of the United States. So, so I mean, just
[02:47:20.880 --> 02:47:25.440]  taking away from this, I'm responding to what she does there. This is the lady who brags about
[02:47:25.440 --> 02:47:30.400]  I came. I saw he died. Hundreds of thousands died. They ship Al Qaeda and ISIS into Syria.
[02:47:30.400 --> 02:47:34.960]  They kill Christians by the hundreds of thousands. She lies about being a war hero being shot at,
[02:47:34.960 --> 02:47:39.600]  you know, in the Balkans and she holds her heart. This little old lady, it'd be one thing if she
[02:47:39.600 --> 02:47:43.360]  really was a little old lady saying I have a dark heart. Maybe I do compare it to a little old lady,
[02:47:43.360 --> 02:47:48.720]  but she's not our average little old lady. Is she Dr. Pachennik? No, what she is doing is what I
[02:47:48.720 --> 02:47:55.920]  have called the fascism of left. She is literally repeating the lies again and again, like Herman
[02:47:55.920 --> 02:48:02.640]  Gehring has said and Goebbels said it very clearly that if you repeat something many, many, many
[02:48:02.640 --> 02:48:08.640]  times, it eventually sounds like the truth. In fact, she knows it's not the truth. She knows
[02:48:08.640 --> 02:48:15.120]  Eric Holder. She knows Eric Holder was involved in arming the drug cartel. She's well aware of all
[02:48:15.120 --> 02:48:22.320]  of this, but the minute she releases a moment of reality, the entire storyline breaks up.
[02:48:22.320 --> 02:48:29.040]  So she has a house of cards, literally a house of cards. And if one card is taken away and she
[02:48:29.040 --> 02:48:35.760]  legitimizes either the Oklahoma bombing or Sandy Hook, which was absurd, absolutely absurd.
[02:48:35.760 --> 02:48:42.160]  And again, it was Eric Holder and Obama. And even if she were to legitimize the absurd videos
[02:48:42.160 --> 02:48:48.320]  and movies about killing Osama bin Laden, who already had Marfan syndrome and was an old man,
[02:48:48.320 --> 02:48:54.320]  and they found them in Pakistan in the most highly secured and most elegant area,
[02:48:54.320 --> 02:49:01.360]  the whole nonsensical narrative breaks apart. So she not only destroys herself,
[02:49:01.360 --> 02:49:08.240]  she destroys eight years of Obama. Well, why did she attack myself and Bannon and the alt right
[02:49:08.240 --> 02:49:12.080]  when everybody knows Obama talks about us all the time? It says, you know, that guy in Texas,
[02:49:12.080 --> 02:49:16.400]  I mean, they know not to say the name for whatever reason, it's not that we need their legitimacy.
[02:49:17.200 --> 02:49:20.320]  They'll mention other people attacking them that aren't effective. They don't want to mention us
[02:49:20.320 --> 02:49:23.680]  because they don't want to draw attention to the fact that we're really right on target.
[02:49:23.680 --> 02:49:32.160]  Well, there's a French expression, ques excuse secues, he who excuses himself accuses himself.
[02:49:32.160 --> 02:49:37.520]  And this is very true of Obama, who's a pathological liar. I mean, he came up through
[02:49:37.520 --> 02:49:44.240]  the way again that she came up, and I can't underline it's enough times. The CIA thought
[02:49:44.240 --> 02:49:49.200]  they would bring up a black narcissist without a background, without any training, with a
[02:49:49.200 --> 02:49:55.280]  nonsensical story, train in Occidental College in Los Angeles, where half of my operatives
[02:49:55.280 --> 02:50:01.120]  retired and trained a lot of people in trans cultural. His parents, grandparents were at the
[02:50:01.120 --> 02:50:07.760]  East West Center, where Obama is now, a total nonsensical cutout for the CIA, and they brought
[02:50:07.760 --> 02:50:13.600]  him into power. She came out of Yale, she works with the agency, so did Bill Clinton,
[02:50:13.600 --> 02:50:20.160]  and they are disasters. The agency is not the highest quality institution that we have anymore.
[02:50:20.160 --> 02:50:26.240]  In fact, the most professional units we have are the people like James Clapper in the DNI,
[02:50:26.240 --> 02:50:32.240]  Directive National Intelligence, who are military air force, who were selected for their intelligence
[02:50:32.240 --> 02:50:36.000]  and professionalism, not for their political action.
[02:50:36.000 --> 02:50:38.000]  Sure, what would you say about somebody like General Flynn?
[02:50:38.720 --> 02:50:45.680]  Well, I'm a great admirer of Flynn, because I saw him actually work for many hours. I was
[02:50:45.680 --> 02:50:52.640]  invited to one of his conferences. He's an aggressive, he's an assertive individual.
[02:50:52.640 --> 02:50:56.080]  Dr. Buchanan, final segments stay right there. We're going to come back and hit more of this
[02:50:56.080 --> 02:51:25.040]  straight ahead. It's info wars.
[02:51:25.040 --> 02:51:29.520]  Go to libertyoncall.org. That's libertyoncall.org.

[02:51:59.600 --> 02:52:02.080]  Honey, I'm really worried about our retirement funds.
[02:52:02.080 --> 02:52:06.880]  Oh, me too. We lost so much value in the recession and the stock market. I'm worried we won't have
[02:52:06.880 --> 02:52:11.360]  enough to retire. Jim next door told me that he had set up a new kind of IRA with a gold
[02:52:11.360 --> 02:52:16.560]  silver group. He said how simple and safe it was. It's a private storage IRA, and we could have real
[02:52:16.560 --> 02:52:21.120]  gold and silver in our hands. Really? You mean we can actually see it and touch it?
[02:52:21.120 --> 02:52:25.360]  Absolutely. Jim said we could have all the benefits of an IRA to help build our retirement
[02:52:25.360 --> 02:52:30.080]  income. Bottom line, we would own a real tangible asset, and we would have the security of knowing
[02:52:30.080 --> 02:52:32.960]  we're protected, no matter what the economy does. What do you think?
[02:52:32.960 --> 02:52:36.800]  I think we need to find out how to get our own private storage IRA. We need to call the

[02:54:09.840 --> 02:54:16.000]  Cleggin says she could not recall all briefings due to concussion FBI report.
[02:54:17.200 --> 02:54:21.600]  So she says she's sick and can't remember things, but she's got the stamina when she gets up out of
[02:54:21.600 --> 02:54:27.840]  bed 10 minutes a day and stumbles around. And guys with injector pins are like, it's okay,
[02:54:27.840 --> 02:54:33.120]  it's okay. She's like about to fall over. But the Associated Press Reuters are all reporting it.
[02:54:33.120 --> 02:54:37.360]  Clinton says could not recall all briefings due to concussion FBI report.
[02:54:37.360 --> 02:54:40.720]  Print that off for me, guys. I'm going to be covering this more the Anthony Gershardt in the
[02:54:40.720 --> 02:54:47.600]  next hour. Labor Day Berry FBI releases Clinton email investigation docs. We'll be covering it
[02:54:47.600 --> 02:54:54.080]  all weekend. Interviews, notes, more. Lost cell phone with classified info. Thought markings were
[02:54:54.080 --> 02:54:59.520]  alphabetical paragraphs, even though she's in the CIA since college. Extensive evidence violating
[02:54:59.520 --> 02:55:05.760]  federal records laws withheld 17,500 emails, throws other people's judgment under the bus.
[02:55:06.320 --> 02:55:13.200]  Hillary's health defense can't recall after the fall. Meanwhile, Leak Memo Soros
[02:55:13.200 --> 02:55:19.840]  I'd stronger internet regulation and TPP that favored himself. And Hillary now her response
[02:55:19.840 --> 02:55:28.160]  is war with Russia. That story is red linked on info wars.com right now. It just went up.
[02:55:28.160 --> 02:55:33.840]  So we'll be covering that in the next hour. Hillary also in 2006 said let's build a wall
[02:55:33.840 --> 02:55:40.880]  to port illegals. But the bigger story is again, Hillary Clinton pushing war with Russia,
[02:55:40.880 --> 02:55:45.280]  which is just a distraction overall. We're going to go back to Dr. Pachettic here in
[02:55:45.280 --> 02:55:48.240]  just a moment. He's been able to do five minutes more with us in the next hour. I'm going to
[02:55:48.240 --> 02:55:54.400]  talk to Gershardt about all the news and clips I haven't played. But when you look at this and
[02:55:54.400 --> 02:55:59.840]  Hillary running around again, saber rattling, I see it as nothing more as a distraction. We'll
[02:55:59.840 --> 02:56:06.560]  talk to Dr. Pachettic in a moment and see what his take is on it. But Paul Watson's got a report
[02:56:06.560 --> 02:56:12.320]  on that at infowars.com and prisonplanet.com are pretty big deal. By the way, I barely plug,
[02:56:12.320 --> 02:56:16.720]  as everybody knows, once an hour. Didn't even really do it this hour. I actually have this here
[02:56:16.720 --> 02:56:21.440]  because the crew likes to drink it. It's vitamin mineral fusion, organic vitamins and minerals,
[02:56:21.440 --> 02:56:26.080]  the full spectrum with amino acids so you can have the more bioavailable. It's vitamin
[02:56:26.080 --> 02:56:30.080]  mineral fusion. When you purchase it, it funds the operation. We now have our bio true selenium,
[02:56:30.080 --> 02:56:36.400]  such a key element in electrochemical activities in the body and cell function. It's from the
[02:56:36.400 --> 02:56:42.400]  mustard seed. Most sources are synthetic. This is only 1995. And similar formulas are like 50
[02:56:42.400 --> 02:56:46.960]  bucks. This is a really good deal. And your purchase funds our operation. So bio true selenium,
[02:56:46.960 --> 02:56:52.720]  our newest product with five star reviews at infowarslife.com. And it's our first run. It'll
[02:56:52.720 --> 02:56:56.880]  probably sell out by the middle of next week. And folks are really liking it. I get amazing energy
[02:56:56.880 --> 02:57:01.280]  from it. And I knew selenium was key, but man, you take a big old dose of selenium. It is something
[02:57:01.280 --> 02:57:06.560]  else. We also have 20% off on vitamin mineral fusion. I should have added that. We have a lot
[02:57:06.560 --> 02:57:11.360]  of other great products at infowarslife.com. We have Hillary for present shirts at cost,
[02:57:11.360 --> 02:57:17.760]  9.95 shipping included. That is cost. So 9.95, you get the shirt and free shipping. I mean,
[02:57:17.760 --> 02:57:23.920]  by that it's included for 9.95. If you wish to buy it for 1995, there's a button to do that if you
[02:57:23.920 --> 02:57:29.040]  want to help fund what we're doing. And believe me, having the funding makes it a lot easier to be
[02:57:29.040 --> 02:57:33.760]  able to continue on and not spend all my time having this penny pension stuff. I need to get
[02:57:33.760 --> 02:57:38.960]  more reporters, more crew. History is happening now. I don't want to contract. I want to grow.
[02:57:38.960 --> 02:57:43.840]  And let me tell you, you either grow or you contract and we're slowly growing. Our reach and
[02:57:43.840 --> 02:57:50.080]  listenership is going parabolic straight up like a rocket, but funding is not. It is creeping along,
[02:57:50.080 --> 02:57:55.840]  though growing, not at a pace to be able to match what we need to do. So please,
[02:57:55.840 --> 02:58:01.840]  there are thousands of great items at infowarsstore.com. We strive to have the very best quality at the
[02:58:01.840 --> 02:58:05.200]  lowest price. A lot of times we have the lowest prices. Sometimes we don't. There's a lot of

[03:00:17.200 --> 03:00:20.800]  Well, I appreciate Dr. Pachennick holding the last five minutes while I was plugging, but that's
[03:00:20.800 --> 03:00:24.400]  that's how we found the operation as he knows. You can read his books, see his material and
[03:00:24.400 --> 03:00:29.440]  read his excellent articles at StevePachennick.com. I'm going to play this special report and start
[03:00:29.440 --> 03:00:33.920]  the next segment. Hillary threatens war with Russia and the media doesn't even report on it.
[03:00:33.920 --> 03:00:38.240]  From the American Legion, I was reading the quotes of what she said. To see this bedraggled
[03:00:38.240 --> 03:00:45.840]  seahag trying to start wars is truly amazing when Russia has the GDP of Italy and China is
[03:00:45.840 --> 03:00:52.720]  obviously in my view the threat. And that's what people like Trump have said. But they like to
[03:00:52.720 --> 03:00:56.240]  bully a country. They think they've got under their control. That's really what it's all about.
[03:00:56.240 --> 03:00:59.920]  She's a Soros globalist. She just sees another country like Ukraine to loot.
[03:01:00.720 --> 03:01:04.480]  What a buzzard like creature. I'm sorry. I'm going to stop ranting. Dr. Pachennick,
[03:01:04.480 --> 03:01:08.320]  thank you for the time. Thank you for the energy. Four more minutes to cover whatever you'd like,
[03:01:08.320 --> 03:01:13.600]  sir. All right. Let me just say categorically, we will not have any war with Russia and we will
[03:01:13.600 --> 03:01:20.080]  not have any war with China. We are destroying ISIS. Now, the reason I say that is not wishful
[03:01:20.080 --> 03:01:27.600]  thinking. General Michael Flynn, who is in the intelligence community and highly respected,
[03:01:28.160 --> 03:01:33.920]  understands that the intelligence community, plus our military community, works very closely
[03:01:33.920 --> 03:01:39.360]  with the Russian soldiers and Russian intelligence. That's never going to change.
[03:01:39.360 --> 03:01:44.160]  The whole issue with Hillary is the fact that she has a whole group of neocon
[03:01:44.160 --> 03:01:50.960]  Jews and neocon Christians who work for Bush senior and were involved in 9-11.
[03:01:50.960 --> 03:01:56.400]  Those are the 50 people who are so-called experts that said that Trump is not qualified.
[03:01:56.400 --> 03:02:02.560]  That's nonsense. The second thing that we have is our economy will grow. If Trump comes in,
[03:02:02.560 --> 03:02:08.240]  I think it's very important to understand that the most important issue is not just immigration,
[03:02:08.240 --> 03:02:13.920]  but it is our economy and the jobs that we have at home. Trump can do that. He is the first
[03:02:13.920 --> 03:02:19.920]  president literally in 50 years. He's been trained in reading a balance sheet, a cash flow sheet,
[03:02:19.920 --> 03:02:26.240]  and understands what it takes to create a business, even if you have to bankrupt that business.
[03:02:26.240 --> 03:02:31.600]  That's part of the dynamics of building and creating businesses. I've done 28 of them,
[03:02:31.600 --> 03:02:36.640]  and I've had to close down half of them. So anybody who's been in the world of business
[03:02:36.640 --> 03:02:42.880]  or creating companies knows that there are all kinds of problems. Hillary has never been involved
[03:02:42.880 --> 03:02:49.440]  in anything other than self-aggrandizement, manipulation, collusion, and corruption.
[03:02:49.440 --> 03:02:55.520]  And that's true of her entire family, including Chelsea, unfortunately, who I knew and I thought
[03:02:55.520 --> 03:03:00.720]  she was a sweet girl. But the worst part of the Clinton family is to corrupt that woman,
[03:03:00.720 --> 03:03:06.400]  that young girl from Stanford. But they don't stop at anything. So we have to be aware now.
[03:03:06.400 --> 03:03:10.320]  It's going to be even more lethal and dangerous on the part of the Clintons.
[03:03:10.320 --> 03:03:15.840]  They will do everything and anything to get that election. They will corrupt the electoral
[03:03:15.840 --> 03:03:21.360]  processes. They will change the machinery. They will create diversion. They will create false
[03:03:21.360 --> 03:03:29.120]  flags. And in turn, we have to make sure that we are aware, that we have situational awareness,
[03:03:29.120 --> 03:03:35.040]  that our soldiers and intelligence operatives overseas vote early and bring in the votes
[03:03:35.040 --> 03:03:39.440]  and make sure those votes accounted that we're at. Let me ask you this because it's so important since
[03:03:39.440 --> 03:03:44.160]  you brought this up, Dr. Pachinick. I come out, say, hey, Trump, you got to watch out for election
[03:03:44.160 --> 03:03:48.400]  fraud. He's already on that page, comes out, starts getting the folks ready to be on top of it.
[03:03:48.400 --> 03:03:53.040]  Obama says it's ridiculous. The feds aren't involved in elections, even though we know they are.
[03:03:53.040 --> 03:03:57.840]  Then he brings in the EU and the UN and actually has Homeland Security now announcing
[03:03:57.840 --> 03:04:02.560]  they're going to seize control of the election. That is sensational. What does that signify?
[03:04:02.560 --> 03:04:06.800]  Well, it signifies nothing. The Homeland Security, everybody knows in the government,
[03:04:06.800 --> 03:04:12.640]  it's nothing more than a paycheck of ineffectual people. And it was a disaster. Most of them
[03:04:12.640 --> 03:04:16.720]  just bring in their pension and they look... So it's just a new agency declaring itself the
[03:04:16.720 --> 03:04:24.400]  commander of everything else? Well, they can create whatever they want. Basically, Washington is dead.
[03:04:25.680 --> 03:04:30.880]  It's functionally inept. And what's happening and why I continue to go at it is we have a
[03:04:30.880 --> 03:04:36.000]  devolution of power more than anything else. And that's what they are afraid of. More than
[03:04:36.000 --> 03:04:41.760]  anything else, it's no offense, Alex, it's not globalism. It's devolution of power.
[03:04:41.760 --> 03:04:45.600]  No, no, I agree. I agree. The globalists are scared of power going back to the people,
[03:04:45.600 --> 03:04:48.720]  back to local areas. Brexit as Trump brought in there.
[03:04:48.720 --> 03:04:52.320]  You've been hammering it forever and it's happening. I want to have you back next week if you'll do it
[03:04:52.320 --> 03:05:05.200]  on the evolution of power. Joe Biggs here with infowars.com. Matt Lauer will moderate the first
[03:05:05.200 --> 03:05:12.560]  forum between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton. On Wednesday, September 7th, NBC News and MSNBC,
[03:05:12.560 --> 03:05:18.320]  along with the Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America, will host the Commander-in-Chief Forum
[03:05:18.320 --> 03:05:23.360]  in New York City. It will be a one hour long forum where Clinton and Trump will answer questions
[03:05:23.360 --> 03:05:29.600]  about national security. The two candidates, though, will not be on stage at the same time,
[03:05:29.600 --> 03:05:36.800]  but instead will go back to back. Once again, Hillary Clinton is too scared to get on the same
[03:05:36.800 --> 03:05:43.200]  stage as Donald Trump. She's a coward. Where's Hillary? She's not in Louisiana. She's not in
[03:05:43.200 --> 03:05:49.760]  Mexico. She's not on the same stage as Donald Trump because she's sick. She's demented and she
[03:05:49.760 --> 03:06:15.280]  can't actually debate. She's scared. You can find more reports at infowars.com.
[03:06:15.280 --> 03:06:21.120]  Right now, we're dealing with massive parasites, which is anything that's harmful to your body
[03:06:21.120 --> 03:06:26.640]  that lives off a host mechanism. Right now, with all the refugees spreading disease around,
[03:06:26.640 --> 03:06:31.360]  we have biological warfare going on everywhere. These are all parasites. Tell us about all this
[03:06:31.360 --> 03:06:35.120]  episode. There's so many things that are in it. You have the neem in there. You have the organic
[03:06:35.120 --> 03:06:40.720]  clove bud, the organic wormwood. I recommend doing a parasite cleanse at least twice a year.
[03:06:40.720 --> 03:06:44.160]  All right. Well, I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today. It just came
[03:06:44.160 --> 03:06:48.720]  back in yesterday. Living Defense, infowarslife.com. And folks, you can't lose full of stuff that's

[03:07:57.920 --> 03:08:19.920]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network.
[03:08:19.920 --> 03:08:29.680]  All right, the video's up on infowars.com.
[03:08:31.680 --> 03:08:36.000]  To Paul Joseph Watson report, and I'm going to add under his video, because people need to have that
[03:08:36.000 --> 03:08:43.440]  as well, my video from a week ago, the threat of nuclear war is not fear porn. And I understand
[03:08:43.440 --> 03:08:48.080]  that governments have saner minds in them, and that the U.S. military's been working with the
[03:08:48.080 --> 03:08:53.440]  Russian military to try to take out ISIS and al-Qaeda when they totally proved four years ago
[03:08:53.440 --> 03:08:56.960]  that Obama and Hillary were literally working with Saudi Arabia to do this.
[03:08:57.600 --> 03:09:02.160]  And that's not hype. That's not a fairy tale. That's not a movie. That really happened.
[03:09:02.800 --> 03:09:06.000]  Our government, Sy Hershey's written articles about it, it's confirmed,
[03:09:08.320 --> 03:09:14.320]  has been hijacked by criminals, and our own military said, we're not doing this,
[03:09:14.320 --> 03:09:20.000]  and then fed the intelligence to the Russians to roll the group up. When the Russians had
[03:09:20.000 --> 03:09:27.040]  destabilized al-Qaeda and ISIS enough, they pulled out. And the next part of the deal is,
[03:09:27.040 --> 03:09:32.480]  after Obama was embarrassed into claiming he'd strike ISIS, now the U.S. military is supposed
[03:09:32.480 --> 03:09:37.360]  to go in and finish it up. And so that's the level of stuff that we told you was happening
[03:09:37.920 --> 03:09:41.520]  four plus years ago, now it's been mainstream news. And I only bring that up,
[03:09:41.520 --> 03:09:46.320]  so you understand. We're not a regular talk show where I go get the Wall Street Journal,
[03:09:46.320 --> 03:09:50.320]  The New York Times, and then every 30 minutes we have a new topic, and I go,
[03:09:50.880 --> 03:09:55.280]  what do you think of this football player who won't stand for the National Anthem?
[03:09:55.280 --> 03:10:02.080]  Well, he's a bastard and a horrible person. Okay, tell us something we don't know,
[03:10:03.360 --> 03:10:07.280]  or maybe he's just misguided. It doesn't matter. It's a diversion.
[03:10:07.280 --> 03:10:10.160]  And I'm not saying you're bad if you're looking at it or talking about it.
[03:10:10.160 --> 03:10:17.040]  What I'm saying is that we tend to focus in on the big central issues to communicate
[03:10:18.000 --> 03:10:24.640]  with people in government and corporations worldwide for true detainment so that the
[03:10:24.640 --> 03:10:30.320]  globalists can't manipulate nation-states off against each other to collapse us so they can
[03:10:30.320 --> 03:10:37.040]  take control. I'm here exposing the hat trick. And once you explain it to the military,
[03:10:37.040 --> 03:10:42.000]  you've explained it to every military. Once you've explained it to the Japanese Vice President,
[03:10:42.000 --> 03:10:48.480]  which I did many years ago, they understand. And I'm not saying that in a haughty way.
[03:10:48.480 --> 03:10:52.320]  You think these people are smart, they are, but they've always been their own politics,
[03:10:52.320 --> 03:10:56.960]  their own system. They go off the mainstream media and off those issues like it's real,
[03:10:56.960 --> 03:11:01.920]  because you instinctively think your national paper is going to actually be trying to help
[03:11:01.920 --> 03:11:07.520]  your country. No, it isn't. There was no other narrative. No one was producing one.
[03:11:08.800 --> 03:11:13.120]  We produced a narrative that isn't perfect, but it is on target.
[03:11:15.120 --> 03:11:23.840]  And now what is really exciting is that narrative is being picked up everywhere and people are
[03:11:23.840 --> 03:11:29.360]  discovering it's not my narrative or Dr. Pachinic's narrative. It is the narrative of what's really
[03:11:29.360 --> 03:11:33.680]  happening, because they don't need to hear it from us. They can hear us talking about something
[03:11:33.680 --> 03:11:37.840]  and then tune right over to what's happening beside them and see it continuing on.
[03:11:40.320 --> 03:11:44.480]  And once you understand the globalist plan, then you can go read the books they've written.
[03:11:46.320 --> 03:11:50.880]  I would say perhaps you should start there, but people don't seem to start with the rulers
[03:11:50.880 --> 03:11:55.280]  of the planet's own books they write. They tend to just stick with mainstream media.
[03:11:55.280 --> 03:11:59.920]  But if you do want to go read tragedy and hope and things like that, you really should, because
[03:11:59.920 --> 03:12:06.160]  then you will look around the world and go, oh my God, these people are out of control
[03:12:06.160 --> 03:12:10.880]  and they're crazy and we've got to stop them. Now, you hear the confidence of somebody like
[03:12:10.880 --> 03:12:14.960]  Steve Pachinic and first and foremost in the military and in black ops and in
[03:12:14.960 --> 03:12:19.360]  plant-stein operations, confidence is everything. And I don't think he's wrong with his confidence
[03:12:19.360 --> 03:12:24.080]  overall. But at the same time, we need to still be really, really concerned because we're sitting
[03:12:24.080 --> 03:12:29.280]  on top of time bomb and he knows that he's trying to give you confidence. But it's not
[03:12:29.280 --> 03:12:35.280]  that it's a lie. We're not sitting here just giving you confidence to be confident. Good
[03:12:35.280 --> 03:12:39.520]  things are happening. So we just want to put that best foot forward and point out that we can
[03:12:39.520 --> 03:12:44.800]  change the world together. I remember Pachinic, when he was still in town, he said, you know,
[03:12:44.800 --> 03:12:49.600]  he's putting that word forward and point out that we can change the world together. I remember
[03:12:49.600 --> 03:12:54.800]  Pachinic, when he was still in council and foreign relations, pretty high up in it and
[03:12:54.800 --> 03:13:00.560]  things leaking info to us. Lovingly, don't let me use that word, giving us information
[03:13:00.560 --> 03:13:06.240]  like 15 years ago that would like then be all over the newspapers in two days. But of course,
[03:13:06.240 --> 03:13:12.160]  we didn't get credit for it. I didn't care. And then people in different agencies and stuff said,
[03:13:12.160 --> 03:13:16.160]  who is this kid? He doesn't even care about getting credit. He'll take all the risk and not
[03:13:16.160 --> 03:13:22.320]  take any of the credit. Well, yeah, I'm trying to defeat the new world order that wants my guns
[03:13:22.320 --> 03:13:27.760]  and wants to conquer my family. It isn't about getting credit fighting these people. But at this
[03:13:27.760 --> 03:13:32.720]  point, we have to give ourselves credit to understand how powerful the information is. And you, the
[03:13:32.720 --> 03:13:37.120]  listener, you, the viewer are at the heart of this whole thing. And so you have to understand, no
[03:13:37.120 --> 03:13:42.080]  matter what happens to myself or others, you carry on this information out of your head.
[03:13:42.080 --> 03:13:49.200]  And after that, that's what's so important. So yes, we are in danger of larger wars. Yes,
[03:13:49.200 --> 03:13:54.640]  the neocons and George Soros and other weirdos are trying to start World War Three.
[03:13:56.960 --> 03:14:00.080]  Yes, the militaries have basically taken that out of their hands,
[03:14:01.200 --> 03:14:07.920]  where we're at a point that's so crazy that the military has had to stand up against Obama.
[03:14:07.920 --> 03:14:12.480]  That's why he fired thousands of different people and has been flipping out and doing all this crazy
[03:14:12.480 --> 03:14:17.680]  stuff. And these dinosaurs like Clinton have finally gone back and reverse engineered where all the
[03:14:17.680 --> 03:14:23.040]  information comes from. And where, let's just say somebody dumb enough to stand up and tell the
[03:14:23.040 --> 03:14:26.880]  truth came from. That's really everybody already knew the truth. Just I was just dumb enough. Now,
[03:14:26.880 --> 03:14:32.640]  I wasn't dumb enough. I believed in humanity. I believe that if we told the truth and warned
[03:14:32.640 --> 03:14:38.800]  people and raised the alarm, there were men and women better than me that would rise up and lead
[03:14:38.800 --> 03:14:43.760]  the fight to defeat this. And it's happening. And that's what this is all about, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:14:45.120 --> 03:14:50.560]  There isn't just evil in the universe. There's good too. But if you do nothing, evil wins the day.
[03:14:50.560 --> 03:14:55.600]  If you forfeit the game, if you don't get in the arena, it's game over. In fact, I want to read it
[03:14:55.600 --> 03:14:59.440]  one more time. So the last two times I asked you for it, I dropped the ball, didn't read it. You guys
[03:14:59.440 --> 03:15:03.680]  print me the man in the arena. Speaks. Thanks. Let's go ahead and go to Paul Joseph Watson's
[03:15:03.680 --> 03:15:08.720]  short report on how what a statesman Trump is bringing people together. Meanwhile, Hillary
[03:15:08.720 --> 03:15:14.800]  is threatening Russia with nuclear war with World War Three. Here it is. If Donald Trump threatened
[03:15:14.800 --> 03:15:20.640]  to go to war with a major military power, do you think the media would be interested? Yet Hillary
[03:15:20.640 --> 03:15:27.440]  Clinton just did precisely that. And it's barely a footnote in the mainstream press. Take a look.
[03:15:27.440 --> 03:15:33.360]  You've seen reports. Russia's hacked into a lot of things. China's hacked into a lot of things.
[03:15:33.360 --> 03:15:40.160]  Russia even hacked into the Democratic National Committee. Maybe even some state election systems.
[03:15:41.040 --> 03:15:46.720]  So we've got to step up our game. Make sure we are well defended and able to take the fight to
[03:15:46.720 --> 03:15:54.160]  those who go after us. As president, I will make it clear that the United States will treat cyber
[03:15:54.160 --> 03:16:01.680]  attacks just like any other attack. We will be ready with serious political, economic and military
[03:16:01.680 --> 03:16:08.160]  responses. In case you missed that, Hillary just said that the next time Russia is blamed for a
[03:16:08.160 --> 03:16:14.160]  hack because there's no evidence whatsoever that they were behind the DNC hack, Hillary will fight
[03:16:14.160 --> 03:16:20.880]  them with a military response, fighting with a military response. That sounds a heck of a lot
[03:16:20.880 --> 03:16:28.160]  like a threat of war to me, threatening to declare war on Russia. You think that would be a big
[03:16:28.160 --> 03:16:35.760]  story, right? Yet virtually no big media outlet even highlighted it. Donald Trump has been savaged
[03:16:35.760 --> 03:16:42.320]  for being reckless with his words. Yet here we have Hillary openly invoking military conflict
[03:16:42.320 --> 03:16:49.920]  with a global superpower and the media gives her a free pass. We've had a year of hysteria over
[03:16:49.920 --> 03:16:56.640]  Trump starting World War III and having control over the nuclear codes. But it's not Trump who's
[03:16:56.640 --> 03:17:04.800]  brazenly threatening another nuclear armed country with war. It's Hillary Clinton. Clinton is crazy.
[03:17:04.800 --> 03:17:11.200]  She thinks Vladimir Putin is behind literally everything from WikiLeaks email hacks to Trump
[03:17:11.200 --> 03:17:19.040]  to the rise of the alt-right, with zero evidence. But the media parrots it like it's gospel. She's
[03:17:19.040 --> 03:17:24.720]  also perfectly prepared to launch into wars that have disastrous consequences. We came,
[03:17:24.720 --> 03:17:31.520]  we saw, we died. And I want the Iranians to know that if I'm the president, we will attack Iran.
[03:17:31.520 --> 03:17:39.040]  We would be able to totally obliterate them. Hillary Clinton openly threatening war with Russia
[03:17:39.040 --> 03:17:45.840]  and the media doesn't even report on it. But they'll continue to lecture us about how it's Trump
[03:17:45.840 --> 03:17:51.760]  who's being irresponsible with his rhetoric. Give me a break.
[03:17:55.040 --> 03:17:58.640]  By the way, when I heard her with that quote, I guess just a few days ago,
[03:17:59.200 --> 03:18:05.520]  it was two weeks ago that the headline was NATO announces that cyber attacks
[03:18:06.640 --> 03:18:11.920]  will be seen as military attacks and the U.S. will respond militarily. And there it is, massive
[03:18:11.920 --> 03:18:18.720]  cyber attack and trigger NATO response Stoltenberg, the head of NATO. So NATO says it might have
[03:18:18.720 --> 03:18:25.520]  grounds to attack Russia. And now you hear Hillary saying the exact same thing.
[03:18:27.120 --> 03:18:30.560]  And of course, they've not proven that Russia did that. You know, early on I said, oh yeah,
[03:18:30.560 --> 03:18:34.720]  Russia's done a lot of hacks like the UN and Climate Gate. Oh, thank you, Russia,
[03:18:35.920 --> 03:18:40.240]  for going into the university where they were organizing the whole UN and over a thousand
[03:18:40.240 --> 03:18:45.520]  universities to, quote, hide the decline and push carbon tax. That was going to be a forced
[03:18:45.520 --> 03:18:50.400]  carbon tax on Russia that would kill their only big export. And it'll hurt everybody
[03:18:50.400 --> 03:18:54.880]  else too. It's a scam. I'm going to pay the Rockefellers and Rothschilds and Al Gore
[03:18:54.880 --> 03:18:58.880]  trillions of dollars. Good job, Russia. Standing up for your own interests.
[03:18:59.920 --> 03:19:03.920]  You understand Russia? People go, why is Russia so aligned with the Liberty Movement worldwide?
[03:19:03.920 --> 03:19:11.280]  And we're like, because it's the new world order. It's the big global government screwing everyone.
[03:19:11.280 --> 03:19:15.040]  Instead of Hydraheads, it's got, you know what, it's just screwing everybody basically.
[03:19:15.040 --> 03:19:20.800]  And people are tired of it, man. And you've got Hillary running around. But the more I looked
[03:19:20.800 --> 03:19:24.400]  into it, now it's been admitted, most of this is all sorts of private hackers, people in U.S.
[03:19:24.400 --> 03:19:31.520]  agencies, DNC staffers. But when she came out and now she just says that Russia hacked, that's not
[03:19:31.520 --> 03:19:37.760]  even admitted by the FBI. She just says it. She lies. She lies. She lies. So a very, very important
[03:19:37.760 --> 03:19:44.480]  video, an eye shot a video a week ago titled World War III is not fair porn. This attitude that bad
[03:19:44.480 --> 03:19:51.840]  things can happen generationally is what leads to giant wars. Governments, communist governments
[03:19:51.840 --> 03:19:55.840]  killed over 200 million people in 20th century. They've killed tens of millions in the last 16 years.
[03:19:55.840 --> 03:20:01.280]  Other wars combined, I mean, World War II killed 21 million Germans, okay, 20 million Russians,
[03:20:01.280 --> 03:20:05.920]  close to a million Americans. And these people sit around like it's impossible
[03:20:07.600 --> 03:20:12.320]  when we're desperately trying to stop it. And I love how it's always mental midgets,
[03:20:13.600 --> 03:20:19.520]  TV heads, video game heads that look at us that are informed, that are communicating to generals,
[03:20:19.520 --> 03:20:24.560]  that are communicating to, you know, real people worldwide trying to stop this. I'm not bragging,
[03:20:24.560 --> 03:20:27.440]  but we're the real people that are informed and involved in what we're talking about,
[03:20:27.440 --> 03:20:31.440]  trying to stop all this crap, trying to get better trade deals, trying to
[03:20:31.440 --> 03:20:35.760]  not have all this GMO stuff causing the cancer, trying to get the glyphosate out of the water,
[03:20:35.760 --> 03:20:39.600]  and all these lazy jackasses look at me and say, I'm the problem. Well, listen,
[03:20:39.600 --> 03:20:43.040]  even if you're a lazy jackass, I still care about you. The globalists think you're an idiot,
[03:20:43.040 --> 03:20:47.360]  want to get rid of you. Okay, now here's my deal. We're going to get rid of the globalist.
[03:20:47.360 --> 03:20:51.200]  If you want to go jump off a cliff after that, you're welcome to, but I'm not going to do it.
[03:20:51.200 --> 03:20:55.840]  Anthony Gutierrez, your take on today's broadcast. You know, it's funny, it's such a juxtaposition,
[03:20:55.840 --> 03:21:00.720]  isn't it? People don't care about the real things. They want to attack you for being in the arena.
[03:21:00.720 --> 03:21:04.800]  I love that allegory, by the way, of being in the arena, because people just, they want to sit
[03:21:04.800 --> 03:21:08.560]  around and they want to watch television and do anything they can to get their mind off of it,
[03:21:08.560 --> 03:21:13.200]  so they don't have to actually think about any of this. And it's funny how people care so much
[03:21:13.200 --> 03:21:18.160]  about things like the Zika virus, like, oh my God, the Zika virus is coming. We have to just do
[03:21:18.160 --> 03:21:23.440]  everything we possibly can at the end of the world, but then you have Putin speaking of even
[03:21:23.440 --> 03:21:28.160]  mentioning World War 3. I mean, that's insane. It's insane. You're moving missiles in. You're
[03:21:28.160 --> 03:21:32.800]  breaking your treaties. You're menacing us. We've got to do something. Why won't you cover it? Why
[03:21:32.800 --> 03:21:36.720]  you keep doing this? We don't even have military bases. We're not doing anything to you. We're
[03:21:36.720 --> 03:21:42.320]  in a depression. You've got horrible wartime sanctions on us. Stop it. What the hell are you
[03:21:42.320 --> 03:21:48.560]  doing? Oh, you just, you just love Putin. No, I don't like picking on people that haven't done
[03:21:48.560 --> 03:21:53.200]  anything to me. Who do I hate? Who don't want to fight? I want to fight the globalists. They're
[03:21:53.200 --> 03:21:59.360]  big. They're powerful. They're pissing on us. People are threatened by anything that disturbs
[03:21:59.360 --> 03:22:03.520]  their reality that they have had created for them. And I'm not sitting here insulting everyone acting
[03:22:03.520 --> 03:22:06.240]  like everyone's stupid, okay? Now, I know our audience knows this, but I'm just talking about
[03:22:06.240 --> 03:22:10.160]  the general public who cannot, the average American that knows three branches of government,
[03:22:10.160 --> 03:22:14.000]  they have no idea who the vice president is. And I'm sorry, Republicans got their problems. But
[03:22:14.000 --> 03:22:18.320]  when you talk to an average Democrat, they are the stupidest people in the world. We go out and
[03:22:18.320 --> 03:22:23.280]  also try to find smart Democrats. They're the dumbest people you've ever seen. They are jackasses.
[03:22:23.920 --> 03:22:26.480]  You know, you talk about why don't people care about that? Why do they say it's fear
[03:22:26.480 --> 03:22:30.080]  of porn? Because they've got different problems. They have a different set of problems. They're
[03:22:30.080 --> 03:22:34.240]  living in a fantasy land. They're living in a fantasy land where they're all powerful and,
[03:22:34.240 --> 03:22:38.800]  you know, they've got their, you know, fantasy land they're going to live in. They've got stacks of
[03:22:38.800 --> 03:22:43.920]  TV shows and video games and comic books they want to look at. Well, good. You're not even an adult.
[03:22:43.920 --> 03:22:49.680]  You're a baby. Well, they're upset. Look, they're upset by Twitter posts. You're upset by the proclamation
[03:22:49.680 --> 03:22:54.160]  of World War Three. They just have different quality problems. And the thing is, the people
[03:22:54.160 --> 03:22:58.000]  that are upset by the Twitter posts, they're going to do anything they can to shut you down
[03:22:58.000 --> 03:23:01.120]  in their brain. So they're going to label you. They're going to say whatever it is they're going
[03:23:01.120 --> 03:23:05.760]  to label you. They're going to try and shut you down because the intrusion into their mindset
[03:23:05.760 --> 03:23:08.800]  that their problems aren't where they should be. You just said it. I was thinking this thing. This
[03:23:08.800 --> 03:23:12.080]  is incredible. I think you just, you just reminded me. I was thinking last night at this morning,
[03:23:12.080 --> 03:23:16.080]  I was like, why do these trendies hate me? Why do they lie about me? Why do they attack me when
[03:23:16.080 --> 03:23:20.400]  all I do is care about them? Because I'm a human. They should care about me. It's symbiotic. And I
[03:23:20.400 --> 03:23:25.920]  realized it. I am intruding on their fantasy land. You are. And that's what they don't like.
[03:23:25.920 --> 03:23:29.920]  You are actually coming in with a sledgehammer. You know, maybe, maybe it doesn't mean every
[03:23:29.920 --> 03:23:33.840]  single thing we say, but you're coming in, look at sledgehammer smashing down the wall. Seriously.
[03:23:33.840 --> 03:23:38.480]  I mean, think about this. And it's all a fantasy land where all that matters is
[03:23:39.120 --> 03:23:42.720]  the things on Netflix and someone getting triggered by something. This is real life.
[03:23:42.720 --> 03:23:45.920]  We joke about this kind of stuff. We joke about getting triggered and all that. People really
[03:23:45.920 --> 03:23:50.720]  care about that. I've spoken to- Oh, no, they get all Harvard is triggered by the word,
[03:23:52.080 --> 03:23:57.600]  all sorts of just basic words. Like, let me spin on this. It's like we're busting into a wall
[03:23:57.600 --> 03:24:03.360]  where there's mind control victims from birth hooked up to virtual reality goggles, whether in
[03:24:03.360 --> 03:24:07.200]  endless orgies or whatever. They're actually all debilitated. They're having their blood siphoned
[03:24:07.200 --> 03:24:12.640]  off for GMO experiences, you know, all sorts of crazy stuff. Here's the allegory. They're hooked
[03:24:12.640 --> 03:24:16.320]  up to this thing. And I'm there trying to unhook them like the matrix. You're trying to unhook
[03:24:16.320 --> 03:24:20.960]  them. And they're like pulling the goggles off and going, get away from me. You're evil. You're
[03:24:20.960 --> 03:24:24.400]  bad. I want back in the matrix. I mean, I think that's what you're saying, Anthony. Yeah, it's
[03:24:24.400 --> 03:24:27.600]  sad because we're not, we're not going in there saying you're stupid. You're bad. We're saying,
[03:24:27.600 --> 03:24:31.440]  Hey, just, just take the goggles off for five minutes. Just look at it saying, Hey,
[03:24:31.440 --> 03:24:34.480]  you know, maybe we don't have all the answers, but at least just take the goggles off. Just
[03:24:34.480 --> 03:24:39.440]  look for one second. Just come on. Just at least try. But then you see, they're not insulting
[03:24:39.440 --> 03:24:43.520]  people like us because they actually look into what we say. They don't read the books that you're
[03:24:43.520 --> 03:24:47.440]  reading. They don't read the information you're presenting. They don't read any of this stuff.
[03:24:47.440 --> 03:24:50.720]  A lot of these people, not everybody, some of these people, they don't read. So what do we do
[03:24:50.720 --> 03:24:55.600]  about them? Because I've seen people that actually awaken involved, decide the matrix and say,
[03:24:55.600 --> 03:25:00.960]  I don't care. I know you're right. I want to go watch movies and play video games and read
[03:25:00.960 --> 03:25:07.200]  comic books. Bye-bye. I choose oblivion. The answer is we have to look at all the systems that led
[03:25:07.200 --> 03:25:11.280]  them there, right? So we have to infiltrate those systems, which is what's happening. I agree. We're
[03:25:11.280 --> 03:25:17.120]  trying. Look at the social networks. Everything that is being posted on there. If you look at
[03:25:17.120 --> 03:25:21.920]  what's really trending, a lot of it is decent news, right? So what happens is people get into these,
[03:25:21.920 --> 03:25:25.920]  as Matt Drudge calls them, ghettos, right? I'm going to say mind ghettos, not even just social
[03:25:25.920 --> 03:25:29.680]  networks, because they can be good in some ways. But mind ghettos, you have to infiltrate the
[03:25:29.680 --> 03:25:34.880]  like prisons of the mind and activate and say, hey, look at this little thing. It doesn't have to be
[03:25:34.880 --> 03:25:38.800]  huge, right? Like just a little bit of a crumb, like a crumb trail. Like when someone gets lost
[03:25:38.800 --> 03:25:43.200]  in the forest and they leave like M&Ms or whatever to follow it, just a little little trail just to
[03:25:43.200 --> 03:25:47.600]  make them start questioning things and thinking about things. Because once you get there, it becomes
[03:25:47.600 --> 03:25:52.560]  addictive. Because once you take the glasses off, you can't just put them back on. You might want
[03:25:52.560 --> 03:25:56.880]  to, but you can't, right? So even if it means questioning a little bit of something, even if
[03:25:56.880 --> 03:26:03.120]  it means using the so-called tactics that the establishment system uses, right? Like little
[03:26:03.120 --> 03:26:08.000]  meme images and like photos. Absolutely. Because if that's what gets them to come into a larger
[03:26:08.000 --> 03:26:12.800]  window and see what's happening, let's do it. It's almost like shooting a laser pointer through a
[03:26:12.800 --> 03:26:18.720]  window into some enslaved groups system. They're in their own little false paradigm. You want to
[03:26:18.720 --> 03:26:22.720]  bring them into a larger paradigm, even though you're not perfect. Then that little laser pointer
[03:26:22.720 --> 03:26:26.640]  makes them come to the window to realize there even is a window. And maybe they see the woman,
[03:26:26.640 --> 03:26:30.000]  they're going to end up loving and marrying and having kids with when they stare down into the
[03:26:30.000 --> 03:26:35.520]  street. All because you distracted them away from the TV for 10 seconds out of that false
[03:26:35.520 --> 03:26:42.320]  dimension into this real dimension. But let me ask you this. They're announcing all the censorship.
[03:26:42.320 --> 03:26:46.960]  They're pulling out all the stops. They're going crazy right now. Is that a sign of weakness or
[03:26:46.960 --> 03:26:52.320]  strength? Total weakness. Think about this. The reason that we are seeing, and by the way,
[03:26:52.320 --> 03:26:55.600]  this is real human empowerment, talking about this stuff. The reason we're seeing all this
[03:26:55.600 --> 03:26:59.680]  actually happening and people getting more so-called awake, so-called aware, whatever you want to say,
[03:26:59.680 --> 03:27:04.320]  is because now more than ever before, look at this image on screen of Mark Zuckerberg walking
[03:27:04.320 --> 03:27:09.280]  around like a god, stuff like that. It reminds people. So let's say they listen to Alex Jones.
[03:27:09.280 --> 03:27:13.120]  Let's say they listened to Matt Judge, whatever, like five, six years ago, and they heard about
[03:27:13.120 --> 03:27:16.640]  some of this stuff. And they're like, I don't know. I'm going to put that under the rug for a while.
[03:27:16.640 --> 03:27:21.760]  What happens is it sits there. It sits in the mind, and then they see something like this photo.
[03:27:21.760 --> 03:27:26.000]  Or then they see Hillary say, I have no health problems, but of course she's saying right now
[03:27:26.000 --> 03:27:30.240]  that she can't remember Benghazi because of her health problems. I mean, those kind of things,
[03:27:30.240 --> 03:27:34.480]  the people aren't actually innately stupid. They're not. And see, if you're conscious, like,
[03:27:34.480 --> 03:27:37.920]  let's take Drudge. The first thing Drudge thinks when she puts out an article saying,
[03:27:37.920 --> 03:27:40.960]  I couldn't remember because I have no memory because of the concussions, is her saying she
[03:27:40.960 --> 03:27:46.480]  doesn't have any memory problems. And it's great. But someone who's tied into this arrested development,
[03:27:46.480 --> 03:27:52.080]  suspended disbelief, TV head stuff, has no memory and is always only in the moment, reactively,
[03:27:52.080 --> 03:27:57.680]  as a spectator, not in the arena. But all info wars does, or Drudge does, is sit there and go.
[03:27:57.680 --> 03:28:01.280]  Obama said feds aren't involved in elections a month ago. Now they're taking them over.
[03:28:02.160 --> 03:28:07.040]  That's, I mean, it's like two plus two equals four. We're not involved in rocket science behavior.
[03:28:07.040 --> 03:28:12.240]  But if you can realize two plus two equals four, if you can't see Zuckerberg's walking by with a
[03:28:12.240 --> 03:28:18.960]  crap eating grin, looking at his idiot employees, squatted over with a virtual reality goggles on,
[03:28:18.960 --> 03:28:23.520]  he's bipedal, they're the slaves, they're devolving, the predators in control,
[03:28:23.520 --> 03:28:28.080]  they're like monkeys with brain ships in their heads. I mean, I didn't call Drudge up and say,
[03:28:28.080 --> 03:28:31.600]  this is total enslavement. By the time I woke up in the morning, he had that up.
[03:28:32.160 --> 03:28:36.240]  Before I even saw what he said about it, I already had that thought when I saw the photo,
[03:28:36.240 --> 03:28:41.280]  I go to Drudge, he's saying exactly what I thought, not because we're synced up psychically,
[03:28:41.280 --> 03:28:46.640]  but because as a normal smart human, I know enslavement and what's bad when I see it.
[03:28:46.640 --> 03:28:52.400]  You posted on Twitter the very second you saw it. And the thing I did, I said it out before I even
[03:28:52.400 --> 03:28:56.320]  went to Drudge and saw that he had it. Exactly. That's what I'm saying is we're synced. He's like,
[03:28:56.320 --> 03:29:00.880]  if I was Donald Trump, I'd say, let's fight globalism. Let's come together as nation states.
[03:29:00.880 --> 03:29:05.600]  Let's have respect. You're not respecting us. I want to respect you. The Mexican president sold.
[03:29:05.600 --> 03:29:10.720]  I said Trump should say that. Trump didn't get that from me. It's just what the truth is.
[03:29:11.680 --> 03:29:16.160]  And that's why you go crazy when you do this for so long because no one listens and you say,
[03:29:16.160 --> 03:29:20.000]  don't people see what's going on? It's not that people are stupid. I don't think people are
[03:29:20.000 --> 03:29:23.920]  innately stupid. They just turn the light switch off in their head because they're busy. They don't
[03:29:23.920 --> 03:29:30.080]  care. They have job to do. I agree. Sometimes I wish I knew how to do that. Okay. Thank God,
[03:29:30.080 --> 03:29:34.480]  I never found the switch where I don't care because I'd probably flip it sometimes. I get it.
[03:29:34.480 --> 03:29:37.920]  I'm looking for it. I don't know where it is. Exactly. I'm looking for this damn switch.
[03:29:37.920 --> 03:29:43.120]  But you know what? Thank God we don't. Thank God we never found it, Anthony. I mean, I don't
[03:29:43.120 --> 03:29:46.480]  want to be these zombies. I'm going to come back, hand the baton to you. I got a few other articles
[03:29:46.480 --> 03:29:52.160]  ahead. Stay with us. This is what freedom looks like for us. Here on the march, the empires on the run,
[03:29:52.160 --> 03:30:03.520]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network. Joe Biggs here with infowars.com. Colin Kaepernick says the
[03:30:03.520 --> 03:30:09.280]  pigs on his socks were only meant to represent row cops. Colin Kaepernick made more news Thursday
[03:30:09.280 --> 03:30:15.120]  when photos of him wearing socks with pictures of pigs dressed like police officers began attracting
[03:30:15.120 --> 03:30:20.480]  attention. This is the same guy who refused to stand up during the national anthem. The San
[03:30:20.480 --> 03:30:25.680]  Francisco 49ers quarterback addressed the situation with an Instagram post later in the morning.
[03:30:25.680 --> 03:30:29.760]  I wore these socks in the past because the row cops that are allowed to hold positions in police
[03:30:29.760 --> 03:30:34.560]  departments not only put the community in danger but also put the cops that have the right intentions
[03:30:34.560 --> 03:30:39.600]  in danger by creating an environment of tension and mistrust. He added that he wore the socks before
[03:30:39.600 --> 03:30:44.880]  he started sitting down during the national anthem prior to the 49ers pre-season games this year.
[03:30:44.880 --> 03:30:49.200]  There is police brutality, the quarterback said. People of color have been targeted by police,
[03:30:49.200 --> 03:30:53.920]  so that's a large part of it and their government officials. They are put in place by the government
[03:30:53.920 --> 03:30:57.920]  so that's something that this country has to change. You can find more reports like this at
[03:30:57.920 --> 03:31:04.080]  infowars.com. More than two years ago info wars first told you about our research into what has
[03:31:04.080 --> 03:31:08.960]  been called the iodine conspiracy. I've told you about how scientists have known for decades that
[03:31:08.960 --> 03:31:14.800]  iodine deficiencies can devastate IQ and how the government knowingly started taking iodine out
[03:31:14.800 --> 03:31:19.840]  of the food and adding fluoride the bad member of the halogen family into the water. They took the
[03:31:19.840 --> 03:31:25.520]  good halogen out and put the deadly halogen in and when the Fukushima crisis worsened as it still
[03:31:25.520 --> 03:31:31.760]  is worsening today I was there telling you how to prepare yourself and your family. Now in 2016
[03:31:31.760 --> 03:31:37.360]  even more information has been revealed concerning the connection between iodine and the gut which
[03:31:37.360 --> 03:31:43.200]  many experts are now saying could be the biggest revelation ever concerning iodine. You can pull
[03:31:43.200 --> 03:31:48.160]  these studies up for yourself. This is the real deal folks and the truth is that iodine is essential

[03:32:02.800 --> 03:32:07.440]  many of you know I'm on a mission to help Americans get and stay healthy. You've all heard the shocking
[03:32:07.440 --> 03:32:13.040]  statistics despite spending trillions of dollars in health care nearly $10,000 per man, woman and
[03:32:13.040 --> 03:32:18.640]  child in this country. Obesity, diabetes, cancer, heart disease and autoimmune illnesses are rampant.
[03:32:18.640 --> 03:32:22.320]  One out of three or four people is dealing with some kind of health challenge and everyone knows
[03:32:22.320 --> 03:32:26.960]  at least one person with a degenerative disease. If you're dealing with a health challenge or if

[03:33:25.360 --> 03:33:30.240]  Everyone can now see it's inevitable. The clash between the Republic and the New World Order.
[03:33:30.880 --> 03:33:36.400]  The source of the globalist power is also its downfall. The stolen keys to the
[03:33:36.400 --> 03:33:47.440]  Renaissance will be returned to our hands if we take them. It is those of us the progeny of liberty
[03:33:47.440 --> 03:33:53.520]  who can pull the sword from the stone. The enemy cannot use it. That's why they've done everything
[03:33:53.520 --> 03:33:59.280]  they can to shut down open free societies while calling themselves the liberals. They are the
[03:33:59.280 --> 03:34:10.560]  enemy of all that is open and free. Liberty only means open, free, independent, wild.
[03:34:11.440 --> 03:34:17.040]  What is open and free and wild about what these people bring us? Trigger warnings,
[03:34:17.040 --> 03:34:23.760]  the family's bad, independence is bad, banned football, banned contact sports, banned language
[03:34:23.760 --> 03:34:32.160]  so that these twisted crones can swim above us in the ether and feel more powerful than us.
[03:34:33.200 --> 03:34:38.160]  Because all they want to do is fall in the wrecks, is bring us lower than them.
[03:34:39.360 --> 03:34:44.160]  That is their destiny. And their destiny is to fall, ladies and gentlemen. I want to read
[03:34:44.160 --> 03:34:50.080]  The Man in the Arena by our former president, Mr. Teddy Roosevelt. Because I mean, I should
[03:34:50.080 --> 03:34:55.200]  read this every day when the show starts. It is not the critic who counts, not the man who points
[03:34:55.200 --> 03:34:59.920]  out all the strongman stumbles or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. The credit
[03:34:59.920 --> 03:35:04.720]  belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood,
[03:35:04.720 --> 03:35:10.560]  who strives valiantly, who errors, who comes short again and again, because there is no effort without
[03:35:10.560 --> 03:35:16.000]  error and shortcoming. But who does actually strive to do the deeds, who knows the great
[03:35:16.000 --> 03:35:22.720]  enthusiasm, the great devotions, who spends himself in a worthy cause, who is at best in the end,
[03:35:22.720 --> 03:35:28.080]  the triumph of high achievement, and who at worst, if he fails, at least while daring greatly,
[03:35:28.080 --> 03:35:34.000]  so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who know neither victory nor defeat.
[03:35:35.440 --> 03:35:42.160]  Everything the social engineers do is to make sure you never have your medal tested. I was
[03:35:42.160 --> 03:35:46.560]  talking to Anthony about this yesterday, growing up in Philadelphia. He was talking about getting
[03:35:46.560 --> 03:35:51.680]  beat up and, you know, getting his nose broken and people robbing him and stuff and how now,
[03:35:51.680 --> 03:35:57.280]  looking back, that made him stronger. And it is totally true. That which doesn't kill you only
[03:35:57.280 --> 03:36:03.200]  makes you stronger. And that's why they want us totally arrested, totally frozen, totally as our
[03:36:03.200 --> 03:36:10.000]  identity being losers, instead of using adversity to make ourselves stronger, using the adversity
[03:36:10.000 --> 03:36:14.400]  to basically piss our pants, roll over in a fetal position and commit suicide.
[03:36:16.240 --> 03:36:23.600]  Oh, exactly. Think about the exact enemy of all this is someone in the arena. They want to make
[03:36:23.600 --> 03:36:27.440]  you a critic. They want to make you sit down on the sidelines and look at people that are actually
[03:36:27.440 --> 03:36:33.360]  doing things and start attacking them and start mocking them. Think about a Roman arena. I mean,
[03:36:33.360 --> 03:36:37.520]  you don't want to go in and die, but at least you're going to pick up your sword and fight
[03:36:37.520 --> 03:36:43.280]  instead of sitting there like a sloth creature on the side. Because the people in the arena
[03:36:43.840 --> 03:36:47.680]  actually know they're conscious in this system. Everybody's in the arena, even if you think
[03:36:47.680 --> 03:36:52.960]  you're a spectator. And so this isn't even the classic, gladiatorial arena. This is the real
[03:36:52.960 --> 03:36:58.320]  arena of life. You decide to die when you decide to not get in the arena. The only chance at life
[03:36:58.320 --> 03:37:02.880]  is the arena. Exactly. But you can delude yourself into thinking that you're not a fighter.
[03:37:02.880 --> 03:37:07.120]  You can delude yourself into thinking you're above the game. You know what? I don't want to
[03:37:07.120 --> 03:37:10.960]  have to sit here and talk about this stuff. It would be great if everyone just realized everything.
[03:37:10.960 --> 03:37:16.160]  And I don't get deep pleasure from people not realizing stuff. The ultimate weakness,
[03:37:16.160 --> 03:37:19.680]  if you think about the people that are doing these things, the corrupt, horrible people,
[03:37:19.680 --> 03:37:23.200]  the real black art of people, if you think about the weakness, it's like going up to a
[03:37:23.200 --> 03:37:27.840]  five-year-old, okay? A five-year-old and equating that to someone that's turned off the light switch
[03:37:27.840 --> 03:37:31.360]  in their head. They don't care their own conscious. And you go up to the five-year-old and you lie to
[03:37:31.360 --> 03:37:36.400]  them and you say, there's a chocolate factory over there. Go over there. It's beautiful. It's
[03:37:36.400 --> 03:37:40.720]  amazing. Go into the chocolate factory. They'll probably be like, okay, does that mean you're
[03:37:40.720 --> 03:37:46.240]  powerful? Wow, you just duped a five-year-old. When you are duping people that don't have
[03:37:46.800 --> 03:37:50.080]  the level of understanding because they're too busy. They're exhausted. They feel like crap.
[03:37:50.080 --> 03:37:53.200]  They're unhealthy. That's it. It's like Mike Tyson meeting up a five-year-old and feeling
[03:37:53.200 --> 03:37:57.520]  powerful. It's a strong man. And that's why they're so scared of Trump is deep down they know
[03:37:58.160 --> 03:38:05.520]  he's a man. He's worldly. He loves life, though. Women, kids, wealth, spoiling the people around
[03:38:05.520 --> 03:38:11.520]  him, hiring tons of minorities, fighting the system. He's always been anti-established,
[03:38:11.520 --> 03:38:16.640]  because he's done it on his own. They know that guy doesn't like them screwing everybody over.
[03:38:16.640 --> 03:38:20.960]  He likes to screw over the big and powerful. He likes to defeat the big guys. He admits that.
[03:38:20.960 --> 03:38:24.400]  And they know that spirit. They cannot stand that manly spirit.
[03:38:24.400 --> 03:38:28.880]  And remember also, the whole point, this is in every PR book. If you've ever read,
[03:38:28.880 --> 03:38:33.120]  if you've ever read PR books or you've ever read, basically, like, not even marketing,
[03:38:33.120 --> 03:38:37.760]  but just kind of like organizing things and harassing people and controlling them and stuff,
[03:38:37.760 --> 03:38:40.880]  the old way, the number one thing is always keep the focus off yourself.
[03:38:40.880 --> 03:38:46.800]  So what the globalist essentially corrupt crazy people do is the focus is on this,
[03:38:46.800 --> 03:38:48.720]  like, oh, the focus is on race or the-
[03:38:48.720 --> 03:38:50.320]  Black Lives Matter. We're foreign men.
[03:38:50.320 --> 03:38:52.160]  We're raping your whole country. We're taking over.
[03:38:52.160 --> 03:38:56.400]  Trump, whether you're GMO or not, gets what he does. He puts the focus on them,
[03:38:56.400 --> 03:38:59.200]  and that is the scariest thing possible. And that's why the media is freaking out.
[03:38:59.200 --> 03:39:02.400]  That's why everyone's freaking out. The focus is finally on them again,
[03:39:02.400 --> 03:39:05.680]  because he's actually asking the questions. He's actually naming people.
[03:39:05.680 --> 03:39:08.480]  He's actually saying, hey, look, these people are screwing up the country.
[03:39:08.480 --> 03:39:09.040]  Start that over. That was interrupting.
[03:39:09.040 --> 03:39:11.280]  But that's bad. That's why there always has to be a new thing.
[03:39:11.280 --> 03:39:16.000]  There has to be a new crazy scandal. Like, it has to be Johnny Depp's ex-wife or whatever.
[03:39:16.000 --> 03:39:19.760]  They're just desperately trying. Like, it's like a waiter, like, would you like this?
[03:39:19.760 --> 03:39:22.480]  Would you like this? And the American people are like, no, we want the red meat.
[03:39:22.480 --> 03:39:25.200]  We want the truth. They're like, would you like some souffle?
[03:39:25.200 --> 03:39:29.840]  They're just trying to get anything to be more viral. But they can't. That's why they're so pissed.
[03:39:29.840 --> 03:39:34.080]  Nothing is more viral than whatever Trump says. That's how he has defeated them.
[03:39:34.080 --> 03:39:36.640]  It's always now on them. The focus is on the establishment.
[03:39:36.640 --> 03:39:38.480]  That's right. Repeat that, because that's so important.
[03:39:38.480 --> 03:39:41.440]  That's why they're so scared, because he knows to go. It's foreign banks.
[03:39:41.440 --> 03:39:44.240]  They're screwing you. It's rigged. And they don't want that.
[03:39:44.240 --> 03:39:46.080]  They're like, no, no, no, you're not supposed to do that.
[03:39:48.080 --> 03:39:51.360]  Hey, I apologize, by the way. Fair enough. Did my audio completely cut out?
[03:39:51.360 --> 03:39:53.520]  Oh, it's okay. I could tell you. I'm back now.
[03:39:53.520 --> 03:39:56.160]  But if you hear me now, please repeat what you were saying.
[03:39:56.160 --> 03:39:59.920]  Elaborate on that, because you've hit on it. That's true. They're afraid of him,
[03:39:59.920 --> 03:40:03.680]  because it's putting it back on them. Exactly. They don't want the spotlight on them.
[03:40:03.680 --> 03:40:06.160]  They want to scurry around like little rats in the darkness,
[03:40:06.160 --> 03:40:10.240]  and then tell you, look over there. It's like the classic military trick.
[03:40:10.240 --> 03:40:13.680]  Like if you're a Spec Ops person, you have like, let's say a little rock or something,
[03:40:13.680 --> 03:40:16.240]  and you throw it over there. So it goes king, and then everyone looks over.
[03:40:16.240 --> 03:40:18.560]  They're like, oh, there they are. Get them. That's what they do.
[03:40:18.560 --> 03:40:21.040]  So they're running around doing all their dirty tricks,
[03:40:21.040 --> 03:40:23.360]  and then they throw a little pebble over there, and it goes ding,
[03:40:23.360 --> 03:40:27.360]  and that's their little scandal. Like that's their zika, or that's whatever it is.
[03:40:27.360 --> 03:40:32.000]  Like now they're trying to say like, oh, like this 17-year-old boy died after getting a hickey.
[03:40:32.000 --> 03:40:35.120]  Watch out. Like any little weird, stupid thing to get your attention off.
[03:40:35.120 --> 03:40:37.600]  To make you fearful, to make you be afraid of what's good in life.
[03:40:37.600 --> 03:40:42.800]  Exactly. Anything good, like mating or being informed or getting in a fight,
[03:40:42.800 --> 03:40:47.360]  which sounds bad, but it's normal ritualistic. Anything like having a hard job.
[03:40:47.360 --> 03:40:49.360]  You know, it's like, no, having a hard job doesn't make you stronger.
[03:40:49.360 --> 03:40:51.040]  It makes you weaker. You've been screwed over.
[03:40:51.040 --> 03:40:52.960]  It's all about making you give up on life,
[03:40:52.960 --> 03:40:55.840]  and not having those rites of passage that make you strong.
[03:40:55.840 --> 03:40:59.600]  Primal instincts are the enemy of all of this.
[03:40:59.600 --> 03:41:01.520]  Because people think of primal instinct as dumb down.
[03:41:01.520 --> 03:41:08.160]  No, it's all the real essence of our highest intelligence manifested when we become primal.
[03:41:08.160 --> 03:41:12.960]  And, you know, think about it like this. So people can say, oh, yeah, primal instinct or gut instinct.
[03:41:12.960 --> 03:41:15.760]  You know, Alex talks about his gut instinct a lot. Well, guess what?
[03:41:15.760 --> 03:41:18.880]  Your gut actually has neurons in it that are directly connected to the brain,
[03:41:18.880 --> 03:41:22.000]  almost as many as your brain. It is your second brain. It is connected in.
[03:41:22.000 --> 03:41:24.800]  Your brain actually tells your body what to do through the gut.
[03:41:24.800 --> 03:41:29.280]  Exactly. So all of this stuff that we say, oh, it's so stupid and old,
[03:41:29.280 --> 03:41:31.040]  and like only people that are unscientific.
[03:41:31.040 --> 03:41:34.640]  It goes back to this. When the brain's hungry, it tells the stomach to growl.
[03:41:34.640 --> 03:41:38.160]  Well, it's a lot bigger than that. The brain says, I don't like this through the stomach,
[03:41:38.160 --> 03:41:39.920]  because the brain doesn't have the same feeling.
[03:41:39.920 --> 03:41:44.240]  And it's admitted through ganglion in the spine, into the gut. That's your brain, folks.
[03:41:44.240 --> 03:41:46.720]  Exactly. So the point is, that's just one example.
[03:41:46.720 --> 03:41:48.880]  It's your subconscious. It's way more powerful.
[03:41:48.880 --> 03:41:52.240]  Let's say a hundred times more powerful on average than your conscious mind
[03:41:52.240 --> 03:41:54.480]  is telling you through your gut. Yeah. So guess what?
[03:41:54.480 --> 03:41:58.080]  That's the big brain. That's the thing with a thousand IQ, telling you what to do.
[03:41:58.080 --> 03:42:01.360]  That's why it's never wrong. The damn thing's so smart. It's incredible.
[03:42:01.360 --> 03:42:02.800]  You have to listen to your instincts.
[03:42:02.800 --> 03:42:04.960]  And they can be screwed up through different things in the food and everything,
[03:42:04.960 --> 03:42:06.400]  but your instincts are there for a reason.
[03:42:06.400 --> 03:42:09.040]  Exactly. And the enemy's trying to hammer our instincts
[03:42:09.040 --> 03:42:11.440]  and our innate programming that is so powerful.
[03:42:11.440 --> 03:42:15.680]  Exactly. See, we live in a deluded world where, oh, no, that's not true.
[03:42:15.680 --> 03:42:18.160]  You have to be academic and you have to look at things and say,
[03:42:18.160 --> 03:42:20.400]  you have to go through our system and use our definitions.
[03:42:20.400 --> 03:42:25.760]  It's all meant to minimize it and not unify the theory when everything is unified.
[03:42:25.760 --> 03:42:28.480]  Verbal domination is control. When you control the language...
[03:42:28.480 --> 03:42:29.840]  Oh, I mean, I was talking about Gary Johnson.
[03:42:29.840 --> 03:42:31.440]  I asked the question earlier why he gets so pissed.
[03:42:31.440 --> 03:42:32.880]  I said, you see, I was being polite.
[03:42:32.880 --> 03:42:35.200]  He couldn't stand it because I really had facts in history
[03:42:35.200 --> 03:42:40.160]  and it was really an intellectual and he was a empty, fake piece of filth,
[03:42:40.160 --> 03:42:41.680]  Democratic Party operative.
[03:42:41.680 --> 03:42:43.040]  No. Yeah. I don't know.
[03:42:43.040 --> 03:42:46.080]  And I'm not bragging. I mean, I really know more than that sack of shit.
[03:42:46.080 --> 03:42:47.840]  Excuse me.
[03:42:47.840 --> 03:42:53.520]  What happens is people use the system as a weapon and that's verbal domination,
[03:42:53.520 --> 03:42:55.360]  which they say you're only allowed to say these words.
[03:42:55.360 --> 03:42:57.120]  You're only allowed to say that is political correctness.
[03:42:57.120 --> 03:42:59.440]  But then they use that as a weapon in their arsenal.
[03:42:59.440 --> 03:43:01.680]  So they say, oh, well, have you not been...
[03:43:01.680 --> 03:43:03.680]  If you're not educated, what is your degree?
[03:43:03.680 --> 03:43:04.240]  Is your degree not in this area?
[03:43:04.240 --> 03:43:05.520]  Well, no, if you're talking about going,
[03:43:05.520 --> 03:43:07.520]  you're not allowed to use the word of the alien.
[03:43:07.520 --> 03:43:10.880]  I said, and he goes, why? He goes, I told you this, why?
[03:43:11.680 --> 03:43:14.320]  Well, shut up. You don't even have any real intellectual arguments.
[03:43:14.320 --> 03:43:17.280]  I'd say, well, why does Mexico have six months to a year hard labor?
[03:43:17.280 --> 03:43:18.400]  Why do they call me legal alien?
[03:43:18.400 --> 03:43:19.600]  I have the article right there.
[03:43:19.600 --> 03:43:20.720]  They use the same term.
[03:43:20.720 --> 03:43:22.080]  You know what comes from Spain?
[03:43:24.080 --> 03:43:27.760]  He goes, no, you, the ruling class, taught Hispanics who are here illegal
[03:43:27.760 --> 03:43:32.080]  to be all hurt and angry like they've been screwed over and butthurt.
[03:43:32.080 --> 03:43:35.600]  If someone dares says, hey, you got to follow the rules of other people.
[03:43:35.600 --> 03:43:38.080]  But see, the same Democrats and Republicans that did that
[03:43:39.200 --> 03:43:41.040]  make it super hard to be legal.
[03:43:41.040 --> 03:43:43.520]  There's all sorts of people like Watson and people I've got here
[03:43:43.520 --> 03:43:47.040]  that from Mexico that are here legally jump through all these hoops and paperwork.
[03:43:47.040 --> 03:43:48.320]  They be able to have to work here.
[03:43:48.320 --> 03:43:51.360]  You should make it easy for smart, hardworking people to come work here.
[03:43:51.360 --> 03:43:52.240]  And that's what Trump's saying.
[03:43:52.240 --> 03:43:54.640]  But see, they cut off that part of his speech
[03:43:54.640 --> 03:43:56.880]  and just have him going on a lot of bad criminals coming in here.
[03:43:56.880 --> 03:43:57.360]  Well, we do.
[03:43:58.000 --> 03:43:59.840]  See, it's all deception, folks.
[03:43:59.840 --> 03:44:03.360]  And I don't get off on deceiving the viewers and listeners.
[03:44:03.360 --> 03:44:06.080]  I get off on seeing us rise.
[03:44:06.080 --> 03:44:07.840]  And I think, I don't think I know,
[03:44:08.400 --> 03:44:11.040]  Anthony, is the spirit of liberty not exploding right now?
[03:44:11.040 --> 03:44:12.800]  It is. It's already, you know, it's already there.
[03:44:12.800 --> 03:44:15.040]  It's already winning. It's already defeating everything.
[03:44:15.040 --> 03:44:18.160]  You think about the concept of what Francis Bacon,
[03:44:18.160 --> 03:44:20.560]  the spirit of liberty, freedom fighters, all this stuff is old.
[03:44:20.560 --> 03:44:21.520]  What's old is new.
[03:44:21.520 --> 03:44:22.640]  That's the funny thing, too.
[03:44:22.640 --> 03:44:25.360]  How many times throughout human history have we had this struggle?
[03:44:25.360 --> 03:44:28.400]  But every single time it seems like it's just so damp in an attack,
[03:44:28.400 --> 03:44:30.720]  it's like, don't you understand?
[03:44:30.720 --> 03:44:34.320]  This is the new age where we are focused on these new things.
[03:44:34.320 --> 03:44:37.040]  And this pseudo-intellectualism of academia.
[03:44:37.040 --> 03:44:40.800]  They create a whole butthurt world of its lynch hall.
[03:44:40.800 --> 03:44:42.240]  They want to hang me.
[03:44:42.240 --> 03:44:45.040]  No, it's an Irish name that lynching got called
[03:44:45.040 --> 03:44:46.720]  because the lynches hung their son.
[03:44:47.600 --> 03:44:50.000]  You know, it's like, I get to get butthurt.
[03:44:50.000 --> 03:44:51.440]  I won the bingo game.
[03:44:52.000 --> 03:44:53.440]  Why play the butthurt game?
[03:44:54.000 --> 03:44:58.080]  Yeah, meanwhile, real intellectualism is curing diseases,
[03:44:58.080 --> 03:44:59.360]  is empowering people,
[03:44:59.360 --> 03:45:01.200]  is talking about things that really work,
[03:45:01.200 --> 03:45:02.240]  economic change, all this stuff.
[03:45:02.240 --> 03:45:03.520]  But we can't have any of that
[03:45:03.520 --> 03:45:06.000]  because we're too busy fighting in this little bubble of BS
[03:45:06.000 --> 03:45:06.880]  that means nothing.
[03:45:06.880 --> 03:45:07.840]  Because guess what?
[03:45:07.840 --> 03:45:09.680]  We got our attention focused there.
[03:45:09.680 --> 03:45:11.280]  We fell and got duped.
[03:45:11.280 --> 03:45:13.120]  Okay, we got duped hard.
[03:45:13.120 --> 03:45:14.640]  We got screwed because we became...
[03:45:14.640 --> 03:45:15.680]  Well, you can't see the con artist.
[03:45:15.680 --> 03:45:19.520]  I mean, if you go to like, you know, the New York Times Square,
[03:45:19.520 --> 03:45:20.480]  that's Hollywood.
[03:45:20.480 --> 03:45:22.720]  That's trying to suck you into its little fake world,
[03:45:22.720 --> 03:45:24.080]  all glittery and beautiful.
[03:45:24.080 --> 03:45:25.920]  But you walk right around the corner to Central Park.
[03:45:25.920 --> 03:45:27.760]  It's like, no, this is where I want to be.
[03:45:27.760 --> 03:45:29.920]  Even when you get mugged in there.
[03:45:29.920 --> 03:45:32.240]  You know, the point is, it's all safe to me
[03:45:32.240 --> 03:45:35.120]  where all the big TVs are and all the craps being sold.
[03:45:35.120 --> 03:45:36.400]  But you go to where the woods are,
[03:45:36.400 --> 03:45:38.160]  then it's not safe, but that's where you want to be.
[03:45:38.160 --> 03:45:40.480]  So I don't know if there's a syndrome
[03:45:40.480 --> 03:45:43.120]  or a symptom of whatever it is called for this too.
[03:45:43.120 --> 03:45:44.800]  But there's the Paris syndrome,
[03:45:44.800 --> 03:45:47.360]  where people specifically from Japan go to Paris
[03:45:47.360 --> 03:45:49.040]  and they watch all these movies and cartoons like,
[03:45:49.040 --> 03:45:50.640]  oh, the Eiffel Tower is so beautiful.
[03:45:50.640 --> 03:45:52.000]  Paris is so amazing.
[03:45:52.000 --> 03:45:53.120]  And then when they get there,
[03:45:53.120 --> 03:45:55.840]  they have a nervous breakdown because it's not that nice.
[03:45:55.840 --> 03:45:57.200]  And the Eiffel Tower is rusty
[03:45:57.200 --> 03:45:59.120]  and there's people pissing on it and stuff.
[03:45:59.120 --> 03:46:02.160]  So they basically have a nervous breakdown panic attack.
[03:46:02.160 --> 03:46:03.840]  And I think it's called Eiffel Tower syndrome
[03:46:03.840 --> 03:46:04.640]  or Paris syndrome.
[03:46:04.640 --> 03:46:06.960]  Well, what it is, do you think the grass is greener?
[03:46:06.960 --> 03:46:08.640]  Look, let's name a syndrome.
[03:46:08.640 --> 03:46:11.920]  I've seen people worship Hollywood stars, worship fame.
[03:46:11.920 --> 03:46:14.720]  I never worshiped it, but I thought, well, let me see it.
[03:46:14.720 --> 03:46:17.040]  Once I was at, and I mean, plenty of times,
[03:46:17.040 --> 03:46:20.320]  the biggest parties, you name it, basically everybody,
[03:46:20.320 --> 03:46:22.160]  these people were totally alone, totally unhappy.
[03:46:22.160 --> 03:46:25.440]  You couldn't pay me to now go be involved in all of it.
[03:46:25.440 --> 03:46:27.520]  But see, only one out of a thousand people
[03:46:27.520 --> 03:46:30.080]  might see what I've seen, maybe one out of 10,000.
[03:46:30.080 --> 03:46:33.920]  So they still think it's like some magic, wonderful world.
[03:46:33.920 --> 03:46:36.080]  No, it's more like hell.
[03:46:36.080 --> 03:46:39.200]  Because you're not just there with a bunch of unhappy people.
[03:46:39.200 --> 03:46:42.000]  You're in a place with like smog and raining ash
[03:46:42.960 --> 03:46:44.560]  with a bunch of neurotic assistance.
[03:46:44.560 --> 03:46:46.480]  So again, it's that same syndrome.
[03:46:47.120 --> 03:46:49.600]  They believe, and that's why people actually get power
[03:46:49.600 --> 03:46:51.280]  and then become even more broken down.
[03:46:51.280 --> 03:46:52.960]  I was going to say Hollywood syndrome.
[03:46:52.960 --> 03:46:54.400]  That's why I was going to say,
[03:46:54.400 --> 03:46:56.560]  it's almost like Hollywood syndrome exists,
[03:46:56.560 --> 03:46:57.680]  even on a micro level.
[03:46:57.680 --> 03:46:59.040]  If people don't get to go to the parties
[03:46:59.040 --> 03:47:02.000]  and see all the craziness, also you can just go to Hollywood.
[03:47:02.000 --> 03:47:03.120]  It's not very nice.
[03:47:03.120 --> 03:47:05.360]  I mean, you go to Hollywood and you think like,
[03:47:05.360 --> 03:47:07.920]  oh, I'm going to just get to bathed in oils
[03:47:07.920 --> 03:47:09.680]  and like hang out with Scarlett Johansson.
[03:47:09.680 --> 03:47:10.480]  No, you're not.
[03:47:10.480 --> 03:47:12.800]  You're going to go get harassed by homeless people.
[03:47:12.800 --> 03:47:13.120]  Okay?
[03:47:14.240 --> 03:47:15.840]  And then if you're at the big house,
[03:47:16.800 --> 03:47:20.080]  there's a bunch of drug addicts and weirdos or fried people
[03:47:20.080 --> 03:47:23.200]  and a bunch of weird producers feeding off of them.
[03:47:23.200 --> 03:47:24.800]  And it's just totally unhappy.
[03:47:24.800 --> 03:47:27.120]  Vampiric, the society over there is vampiric.
[03:47:27.120 --> 03:47:27.920]  Not everyone's bad.
[03:47:27.920 --> 03:47:28.960]  There's a lot of awesome stuff there.
[03:47:28.960 --> 03:47:32.080]  But there's vampires that they also want to just take
[03:47:32.080 --> 03:47:32.960]  all the people that are going to be happy.
[03:47:32.960 --> 03:47:33.760]  Well, I'll say this.
[03:47:33.760 --> 03:47:36.000]  You can hardly, I mean, I've got a lot of big invites out there
[03:47:36.000 --> 03:47:37.360]  and a lot of big stuff and I've been out there years.
[03:47:37.360 --> 03:47:38.560]  You cannot get me out there.
[03:47:40.080 --> 03:47:43.520]  So, I mean, I just, I mean, I thought it was just the oxygen
[03:47:43.520 --> 03:47:45.200]  before, but I noticed I was already getting sick
[03:47:45.200 --> 03:47:46.880]  before the plane even landed.
[03:47:46.880 --> 03:47:49.360]  I'd be flying and there'd be fires all around the plane
[03:47:49.360 --> 03:47:50.000]  like it's hell.
[03:47:50.560 --> 03:47:52.560]  Every time I've flown, there's fires everywhere.
[03:47:52.560 --> 03:47:55.520]  And you see fires out the windows and then you land.
[03:47:55.520 --> 03:47:56.800]  It's like zombies everywhere.
[03:47:58.560 --> 03:48:01.840]  You mean you didn't feel like Hollywood was so glamorous
[03:48:01.840 --> 03:48:03.440]  and there were just stars everywhere.
[03:48:03.440 --> 03:48:04.400]  And it was happiness?
[03:48:05.600 --> 03:48:05.920]  No.
[03:48:05.920 --> 03:48:07.840]  And people know that I know people like Charlie Sheenest
[03:48:07.840 --> 03:48:08.880]  and stuff, but that's the tip of the iceberg.
[03:48:08.880 --> 03:48:09.200]  Charlie Sheenest.
[03:48:09.200 --> 03:48:09.920]  It's funny, actually.
[03:48:09.920 --> 03:48:12.480]  If people knew the invitations you got that you put down,
[03:48:12.480 --> 03:48:13.120]  you say no way.
[03:48:13.120 --> 03:48:14.800]  Well, the point is Charlie's had a lot of courage
[03:48:14.800 --> 03:48:15.440]  and had some problems.
[03:48:15.440 --> 03:48:17.360]  The point is, is that that's the tip of the iceberg.
[03:48:17.920 --> 03:48:19.840]  But I've been around other people bigger than him
[03:48:19.840 --> 03:48:20.320]  in Hollywood.
[03:48:20.320 --> 03:48:22.880]  And if you sit there and like play into the narcissism
[03:48:22.880 --> 03:48:25.200]  with them and like, it's like they're under mind control.
[03:48:25.200 --> 03:48:26.160]  Then they love you.
[03:48:26.160 --> 03:48:28.080]  But the minute you're just like, they go, oh,
[03:48:28.080 --> 03:48:29.520]  you don't like it or do you like, no, I'm gone.
[03:48:29.520 --> 03:48:30.960]  They're like, yes, it's horrible.
[03:48:30.960 --> 03:48:33.760]  I mean, these people are slaves. It is hell.
[03:48:33.760 --> 03:48:35.920]  Hollywood is hell, brother.
[03:48:36.720 --> 03:48:37.040]  Yeah.
[03:48:37.040 --> 03:48:38.960]  I mean, why do you think all those production companies,
[03:48:38.960 --> 03:48:42.000]  everything, the wannabe people, they don't just say, oh,
[03:48:42.000 --> 03:48:43.120]  you're a great singer.
[03:48:43.120 --> 03:48:45.600]  Come on in and we're going to give you a great deal.
[03:48:45.600 --> 03:48:46.640]  They are vampires.
[03:48:46.640 --> 03:48:49.120]  They take all the wannabe people that don't have anything,
[03:48:49.120 --> 03:48:50.640]  don't have legal representation.
[03:48:50.640 --> 03:48:52.240]  They give them the worst deals possible.
[03:48:52.240 --> 03:48:53.200]  They control every aspect of the world.
[03:48:53.200 --> 03:48:55.280]  Throw you out there and see what catches on
[03:48:55.280 --> 03:48:57.840]  and then take everything from you and then have the boys
[03:48:57.840 --> 03:48:59.840]  drop by when they're ready to cash in on insurance
[03:48:59.840 --> 03:49:02.160]  when they think your career's peaked and inject you
[03:49:02.880 --> 03:49:04.640]  and then you committed suicide.
[03:49:04.640 --> 03:49:08.080]  And they do, they do kill a large portion of the stars
[03:49:08.080 --> 03:49:08.880]  and the music people.
[03:49:08.880 --> 03:49:11.920]  That's why so many die at their peak at 28 or 30
[03:49:11.920 --> 03:49:12.960]  because you're being murdered.
[03:49:14.400 --> 03:49:15.520]  Sounds like a great system.
[03:49:16.640 --> 03:49:18.320]  Sounds like I'm going to start my own entity
[03:49:19.440 --> 03:49:20.640]  and not screw people over.
[03:49:20.640 --> 03:49:20.960]  Exactly.
[03:49:20.960 --> 03:49:21.760]  I'm we're great.
[03:49:21.760 --> 03:49:22.320]  The world, brother.
[03:49:22.320 --> 03:49:23.600]  This is the Renaissance.
[03:49:23.600 --> 03:49:24.800]  It's a new world, baby.
[03:49:24.800 --> 03:49:26.400]  In a dyad, right?
[03:49:26.400 --> 03:49:28.960]  So here's Hollywood and the fake establishment system.
[03:49:28.960 --> 03:49:32.160]  This is just independent Liberty loving people
[03:49:32.160 --> 03:49:33.280]  that don't care that are passionate.
[03:49:33.280 --> 03:49:36.000]  They want to get in the arena that they're not afraid
[03:49:36.000 --> 03:49:38.240]  of false ring to the system, right?
[03:49:38.240 --> 03:49:40.160]  It doesn't mean being totally insane
[03:49:40.160 --> 03:49:41.840]  and totally detached from reality, right?
[03:49:41.840 --> 03:49:44.320]  Because you have to use reality as a weapon
[03:49:44.320 --> 03:49:45.200]  because reality is great.
[03:49:45.200 --> 03:49:46.880]  A third part of reality is amazing.
[03:49:46.880 --> 03:49:51.760]  But the dyad is actually shifting towards Liberty once again.
[03:49:51.760 --> 03:49:53.760]  And I think this has happened a million times throughout history.
[03:49:53.760 --> 03:49:56.160]  You can look at all the ancient societies
[03:49:56.160 --> 03:49:58.480]  and you can look at all their problems.
[03:49:58.480 --> 03:50:03.840]  I would rather be around hardcore combat soldiers than anybody
[03:50:03.840 --> 03:50:06.080]  because just the vibe is so much more real
[03:50:06.880 --> 03:50:09.200]  compared to like a Hollywood fop.
[03:50:09.920 --> 03:50:12.800]  I mean, it's like this person's alive and real and honorable
[03:50:13.360 --> 03:50:17.040]  and way more powerful than this Hollywood producer
[03:50:17.040 --> 03:50:20.160]  that's worth $5 billion who's a total piece of crap.
[03:50:20.160 --> 03:50:22.800]  And I mean, that's or some trailblazer in media
[03:50:22.800 --> 03:50:24.800]  that tells the truth and has a strong spirit.
[03:50:24.800 --> 03:50:25.760]  I want to be around that,
[03:50:25.760 --> 03:50:27.520]  not just because somebody has a bunch of money.
[03:50:27.520 --> 03:50:30.080]  Well, I think people are sculpted by what they have to face, too.
[03:50:30.080 --> 03:50:31.520]  And the thing is, you've seen a lot of things,
[03:50:31.520 --> 03:50:33.040]  you come in here and try to tell people,
[03:50:33.040 --> 03:50:34.960]  they don't understand because they haven't seen it before.
[03:50:34.960 --> 03:50:37.280]  Just like someone who's a combat-hardened veteran
[03:50:37.280 --> 03:50:40.000]  has maybe seen kids die in front of them, has killed kids.
[03:50:40.560 --> 03:50:43.600]  And they try to explain that to someone, explain the value of things,
[03:50:43.600 --> 03:50:45.200]  and they just, they're not going to get it.
[03:50:45.200 --> 03:50:47.200]  That's right. It's about your experiences.
[03:50:47.200 --> 03:50:49.760]  And the globalists want to keep you an artificial experience,
[03:50:49.760 --> 03:50:51.360]  not real experience,
[03:50:51.360 --> 03:50:54.720]  so that you don't graduate to the hierarchy of human development.
[03:50:54.720 --> 03:50:56.480]  Anthony, come back, finish up with a plug, too,
[03:50:56.480 --> 03:50:58.160]  because we need to find this operation.
[03:50:58.160 --> 03:50:59.040]  I'm gonna go have this meeting.
[03:51:01.760 --> 03:51:03.600]  Do you know that good digestion
[03:51:03.600 --> 03:51:05.760]  is your body's first line of defense?
[03:51:06.320 --> 03:51:09.200]  Millions of Americans suffer from poor digestion.
[03:51:09.200 --> 03:51:10.960]  It shows up in the form of heartburn,
[03:51:10.960 --> 03:51:13.360]  acid reflux, GERD, irritable bowel syndrome,
[03:51:13.360 --> 03:51:16.960]  indigestion, constipation, diarrhea, and many other symptoms.
[03:51:16.960 --> 03:51:20.560]  Healthy digestion relies on armies of friendly bacteria.
[03:51:20.560 --> 03:51:22.960]  These good bugs keep bad bugs in check.
[03:51:22.960 --> 03:51:26.080]  Probe immune, a new, uniquely developed probiotic
[03:51:26.080 --> 03:51:28.320]  is scientifically proven to get to your gut
[03:51:28.320 --> 03:51:30.880]  and deliver the benefits of improved digestion.
[03:51:30.880 --> 03:51:32.720]  Probe immune is an immune system booster
[03:51:32.720 --> 03:51:34.880]  and a digestive health enhancer.
[03:51:34.880 --> 03:51:37.200]  It's simple to use, and most importantly,
[03:51:37.200 --> 03:51:40.880]  you will feel probe immune working, soothing, and relaxing the gut.

[03:52:26.160 --> 03:52:27.440]  Unlike other preps,
[03:52:27.440 --> 03:52:30.000]  Solarc is used every day to help offset
[03:52:30.000 --> 03:52:31.680]  your electric bill automatically.

[03:52:55.920 --> 03:52:58.880]  is energy insurance for your family.
[03:52:58.880 --> 03:53:01.360]  Honey, I'm really worried about a retirement fund.
[03:53:01.360 --> 03:53:02.400]  Oh, me too.
[03:53:02.400 --> 03:53:05.280]  We lost so much value in the recession and the stock market.
[03:53:05.280 --> 03:53:07.040]  I'm worried we won't have enough to retire.
[03:53:07.040 --> 03:53:10.000]  Jim next door told me that he had set up a new kind of IRA
[03:53:10.000 --> 03:53:11.200]  with a gold silver groove.
[03:53:11.200 --> 03:53:12.880]  He said how simple and safe it was.
[03:53:12.880 --> 03:53:14.720]  It's a private storage IRA,
[03:53:14.720 --> 03:53:17.600]  and we could have real gold and silver in our hands.
[03:53:17.600 --> 03:53:20.320]  Really? You mean we can actually see it and touch it?
[03:53:20.320 --> 03:53:23.360]  Absolutely. Jim said we could have all the benefits of an IRA
[03:53:23.360 --> 03:53:25.040]  to help build a retirement income.
[03:53:25.040 --> 03:53:27.520]  Bottom line, we would own a real tangible asset,
[03:53:27.520 --> 03:53:30.000]  and we would have the security of knowing we're protected,
[03:53:30.000 --> 03:53:31.520]  no matter what the economy does.
[03:53:31.520 --> 03:53:32.160]  What do you think?
[03:53:32.160 --> 03:53:35.280]  I think we need to find out how to get our own private storage IRA.
[03:53:35.280 --> 03:53:37.520]  We need to call the gold silver group right now.
[03:53:37.520 --> 03:53:39.360]  Are you ready to protect your future?
[03:53:39.360 --> 03:53:43.600]  Call 800-421-3432 now to find out how easy and safe it is

[03:53:50.400 --> 03:53:53.120]  All transactions are privately delivered and fully insured.
[03:53:53.120 --> 03:53:56.080]  Please call us now. 800-421-3432.
[03:53:56.080 --> 03:53:58.160]  800-421-3432.
[03:54:07.440 --> 03:54:09.040]  It's the final segment of the show.
[03:54:09.040 --> 03:54:11.120]  It's the Alex Jones show, Anthony Giorgiardi.
[03:54:11.120 --> 03:54:12.400]  That was a great talk with Alex.
[03:54:13.360 --> 03:54:15.600]  It really, really puts things into perspective,
[03:54:15.600 --> 03:54:18.160]  and you've got to think about this, too.
[03:54:18.160 --> 03:54:20.160]  No matter what you're doing, you are supporting something.
[03:54:20.800 --> 03:54:22.560]  So what did you do today?
[03:54:22.560 --> 03:54:24.320]  Maybe you went to Starbucks in the morning,
[03:54:24.320 --> 03:54:26.080]  you purchased a coffee, you're supporting Starbucks.
[03:54:26.720 --> 03:54:28.560]  Not that you're bad for doing that.
[03:54:28.560 --> 03:54:30.400]  I drink Starbucks coffee sometimes, too.
[03:54:30.400 --> 03:54:33.600]  But what you're doing is every day you are supporting things.
[03:54:33.600 --> 03:54:37.760]  You're choosing to give clicks and views to some websites.
[03:54:37.760 --> 03:54:40.560]  You're choosing to financially support some groups,
[03:54:40.560 --> 03:54:42.000]  organizations, products, whatever.
[03:54:42.560 --> 03:54:44.960]  And it's important to support the organizations
[03:54:44.960 --> 03:54:47.760]  you actually like, and that are actually doing something for you
[03:54:47.760 --> 03:54:48.880]  and giving you value.
[03:54:49.600 --> 03:54:53.040]  And actually going ahead and projecting forward
[03:54:53.680 --> 03:54:55.440]  the things that you know are important.
[03:54:55.440 --> 03:54:57.840]  And the point of that is, the truth is,
[03:54:58.720 --> 03:55:01.120]  the products at InfoWarsLife.com are the very best.
[03:55:01.120 --> 03:55:03.360]  They're absolutely the top quality.
[03:55:03.360 --> 03:55:06.640]  We talk about the manufacturers that will have herbs fall on the floor
[03:55:06.640 --> 03:55:07.920]  and they'll sweep it up with a broom
[03:55:07.920 --> 03:55:09.440]  and they'll just put it back on the conveyor belt.
[03:55:09.440 --> 03:55:10.720]  Yeah, we don't do that.
[03:55:10.720 --> 03:55:13.600]  We don't gash prices and go crazy on people.
[03:55:13.600 --> 03:55:15.520]  It's super affordable. It's really good stuff.
[03:55:16.080 --> 03:55:18.000]  And right now, this is important
[03:55:18.000 --> 03:55:20.720]  because vitamin mineral fusion is 20% off,
[03:55:21.440 --> 03:55:23.520]  which is, of course, the multivitamin drink.
[03:55:23.520 --> 03:55:24.320]  It tastes great.
[03:55:24.880 --> 03:55:26.800]  It doesn't even have stevia in it.
[03:55:26.800 --> 03:55:29.360]  It has xylitol, which is great for your teeth.
[03:55:29.360 --> 03:55:30.720]  It has everything you need.
[03:55:30.720 --> 03:55:31.760]  Vitamin mineral fusion.
[03:55:31.760 --> 03:55:34.400]  And then, of course, Biotrue selenium, which is brand new.
[03:55:34.960 --> 03:55:39.840]  It is 100% organic mustard seed extract selenium
[03:55:39.840 --> 03:55:42.640]  of the highest bio available form.
[03:55:42.640 --> 03:55:44.880]  It's absolutely the best on infowarslife.com.
[03:55:44.880 --> 03:55:48.320]  And that goes great with survival shield X2.
[03:55:48.320 --> 03:55:49.360]  It's the perfect pair.
[03:55:49.360 --> 03:55:52.080]  Cinerogistically helps promote thyroid health,
[03:55:52.080 --> 03:55:55.200]  support so much from DNA production to eyesight.
[03:55:55.200 --> 03:55:56.320]  It's the real deal.
[03:55:56.320 --> 03:55:58.880]  Definitely need to check it out infowarslife.com.
[03:55:59.520 --> 03:56:01.120]  And this is your last chance.
[03:56:01.120 --> 03:56:03.040]  If you still want to get the AmeriGeddon DVD
[03:56:03.040 --> 03:56:06.960]  with the free offers, it's the two of Alex's films for free
[03:56:06.960 --> 03:56:10.320]  or a colloidal silver bullet, which is $20, by the way.
[03:56:10.320 --> 03:56:14.000]  So it's $20 free if you get two DVDs of AmeriGeddon.
[03:56:14.000 --> 03:56:15.200]  That special is going to be over.
[03:56:15.760 --> 03:56:18.160]  And by the way, the selenium is under $20.
[03:56:18.160 --> 03:56:18.720]  Okay.
[03:56:18.720 --> 03:56:22.000]  So you could choose to go to a gas station
[03:56:22.000 --> 03:56:24.880]  and get like a protein bar and some waters
[03:56:25.520 --> 03:56:28.800]  and cost about as much as one product
[03:56:28.800 --> 03:56:31.520]  that could really help you and potentially change your life.
[03:56:31.520 --> 03:56:33.440]  So the infowarslife.com
[03:56:33.440 --> 03:56:34.960]  support things that you believe in,
[03:56:34.960 --> 03:56:37.680]  support the operation that actually makes a difference.
[03:56:37.680 --> 03:56:38.880]  Even if it's not perfect,
[03:56:38.880 --> 03:56:40.160]  we're sitting here in the arena.
[03:56:40.160 --> 03:56:41.760]  We talked about being in the arena.
[03:56:41.760 --> 03:56:44.080]  I want to hit a few little news pieces here before we go.
[03:56:44.080 --> 03:56:45.680]  They're actually big news pieces.
[03:56:45.680 --> 03:56:46.480]  So look at this.
[03:56:46.480 --> 03:56:48.640]  Like it's been nuked, millions of bees dead
[03:56:48.640 --> 03:56:51.600]  after South Carolina sprays for Zika mosquitoes.
[03:56:51.600 --> 03:56:53.040]  And the reason I printed this one out,
[03:56:53.040 --> 03:56:54.640]  as you may have heard already,
[03:56:54.640 --> 03:56:56.480]  is the Zika hysteria.
[03:56:56.480 --> 03:56:57.680]  What did we talk about earlier?
[03:56:57.680 --> 03:57:00.080]  We talked about the concept of hysteria
[03:57:00.080 --> 03:57:02.000]  just being pumped in like adrenaline
[03:57:02.000 --> 03:57:03.760]  into the veins of the country, right?
[03:57:03.760 --> 03:57:06.320]  The media just, oh, Zika is what you have to care about.
[03:57:06.320 --> 03:57:07.360]  Don't worry about anything else.
[03:57:07.360 --> 03:57:08.560]  This is it.
[03:57:08.560 --> 03:57:11.040]  So they're just spraying all over the place
[03:57:11.040 --> 03:57:13.360]  to get these mosquitoes that could potentially,
[03:57:13.360 --> 03:57:15.760]  theoretically, maybe be carrying Zika.
[03:57:15.760 --> 03:57:18.240]  And yeah, maybe it is an issue, right?
[03:57:18.240 --> 03:57:21.600]  But as a result, they kill millions of bees,
[03:57:21.600 --> 03:57:23.360]  which are already in sharp decline
[03:57:23.360 --> 03:57:26.240]  and are responsible for two-thirds of the entire food supply.
[03:57:26.240 --> 03:57:29.680]  Now, let's look at this next piece, too,
[03:57:29.680 --> 03:57:31.360]  as another example of this.
[03:57:31.360 --> 03:57:35.040]  So this is an article that was among the top on Reddit news,
[03:57:35.040 --> 03:57:37.920]  which is, I think, the number five website in the world.
[03:57:37.920 --> 03:57:40.240]  It's very, very big, especially for finding news.
[03:57:40.240 --> 03:57:43.440]  Man claims he has Pokemon, tries to lure kids into car,
[03:57:43.440 --> 03:57:44.480]  police say.
[03:57:44.480 --> 03:57:46.480]  So Pokemon go the app, right?
[03:57:46.480 --> 03:57:49.040]  Oh, it's like, you always hear about these stories
[03:57:49.040 --> 03:57:51.040]  of people trying to lure children into cars.
[03:57:51.040 --> 03:57:53.440]  And when I was younger, I used to watch the Nutley News
[03:57:53.440 --> 03:57:54.640]  with my parents, and it would always be,
[03:57:54.640 --> 03:57:57.280]  watch out, your child could be kidnapped.
[03:57:57.280 --> 03:57:58.480]  This could happen.
[03:57:58.480 --> 03:58:00.640]  But the truth is, I printed out some stats,
[03:58:00.640 --> 03:58:03.200]  and we got to go to break here to end this show.
[03:58:03.200 --> 03:58:07.040]  But basically, more than 90% of kidnapped children
[03:58:07.040 --> 03:58:08.160]  are from friends and family.
[03:58:08.160 --> 03:58:11.120]  It's almost never that a stranger does it,
[03:58:11.120 --> 03:58:13.360]  and only 100 children a year are even kidnapped,
[03:58:13.360 --> 03:58:16.800]  a fraction of 1%, and half of those return home.
[03:58:16.800 --> 03:58:19.200]  So, wait a minute, why are we so freaked out constantly?
[03:58:19.200 --> 03:58:21.200]  Your child could be kidnapped from a stranger.
[03:58:21.200 --> 03:58:23.200]  It's because they want to scare you about things
[03:58:23.200 --> 03:58:24.800]  like getting struck by lightning or this.
[03:58:24.800 --> 03:58:26.160]  A boy died after getting hickey.
[03:58:26.160 --> 03:58:27.760]  Could you die from getting a hickey?
[03:58:27.760 --> 03:58:30.640]  It's all craziness, all distraction, all madness.
[03:58:30.640 --> 03:58:33.840]  Alex will be back on Sunday from 4 to 6 p.m. Central,
[03:58:33.840 --> 03:58:35.640]  and of course, Monday, 11 a.m. to 2 p.m.
