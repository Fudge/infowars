[00:00.000 --> 00:05.000]  Thank you for listening to GCN. Great Talk Radio starts here.
[00:30.000 --> 00:57.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, I am your host Alex Jones and I want to thank you for joining us here today.
[00:57.000 --> 01:10.000]  The magnitude of the information that we're going to be covering is undoubtedly the most off the chart,
[01:10.000 --> 01:20.000]  out in the open, false flag event that I have personally ever seen.
[01:20.000 --> 01:29.000]  We have caught them red handed and we're going to be analyzing and breaking all of this down today.
[01:29.000 --> 01:40.000]  This is all coming up here on the broadcast.
[01:40.000 --> 01:50.000]  I am going to attempt as best I can after the break when we come back to go over all the different facets of this,
[01:50.000 --> 01:55.000]  but we saw a massive cover up yesterday within five minutes of us announcing.
[01:55.000 --> 02:00.000]  We had the photos and videos of what looked like Navy SEALs along with what looked like Saudi Arabians
[02:00.000 --> 02:03.000]  and what looked like good old boy patsies.
[02:03.000 --> 02:05.000]  They were preparing to set up all the black backpacks.
[02:05.000 --> 02:10.000]  CNN looked completely panicked during the break and said, oh, now there's been an arrest.
[02:10.000 --> 02:12.000]  There's going to be a press conference at five.
[02:12.000 --> 02:18.000]  But then they figured out, wait, now when we show the photos that Jones has, then everyone's going to say,
[02:18.000 --> 02:20.000]  well, what about all these other people?
[02:20.000 --> 02:23.000]  And I even predicted on air because I know how they operate.
[02:23.000 --> 02:34.000]  I even predicted on air that they would then cancel the press conference and be put into disarray
[02:34.000 --> 02:36.000]  because they have to now go to another plan.
[02:36.000 --> 02:38.000]  I want to explain something.
[02:38.000 --> 02:44.000]  You've got guys with Navy SEAL hats on that look like Navy SEALs with police before and after the bombing,
[02:44.000 --> 02:49.000]  right up at the finish line, right next to Saudi Arabians with black backpacks, what looked like Saudi Arabians
[02:49.000 --> 02:51.000]  and good old boys with backpacks.
[02:51.000 --> 02:54.000]  And you've got them saying remain calm.
[02:54.000 --> 02:56.000]  We have witnesses that have proven that.
[02:56.000 --> 02:58.000]  We know there was a drill they were using to cover this up.
[02:58.000 --> 03:02.000]  The Navy SEALs are standing around like they don't know what to do
[03:02.000 --> 03:05.000]  and they've got their black bags on their phones waiting to be told what to do.
[03:05.000 --> 03:07.000]  They were just there to add confusion.
[03:07.000 --> 03:10.000]  I am not accusing the Navy SEALs of being involved in this.
[03:10.000 --> 03:14.000]  This is how standard operating procedure goes for criminal networks.
[03:14.000 --> 03:16.000]  They call a drill from the top.
[03:16.000 --> 03:25.000]  The agencies show up so that if their own operatives within get caught, they just say, oh, it's part of the larger drill.
[03:25.000 --> 03:30.000]  So all of that and more is coming up today.
[03:30.000 --> 03:34.000]  You've had an emergency meeting with the Saudi foreign minister and Obama that was not on the schedule
[03:34.000 --> 03:37.000]  with all sorts of sedans pulling up and freaking out.
[03:37.000 --> 03:40.000]  You had them talking about deporting a Saudi who was arrested.
[03:40.000 --> 03:43.000]  Oh, he's a suspect. We're going to deport him. Let's not.
[03:43.000 --> 03:45.000]  And now you've got Janet Napolitano.
[03:45.000 --> 03:49.000]  Here's the big news coming out this morning and the FBI and saying, okay, here's the photos.
[03:49.000 --> 03:52.000]  They're not suspects because, you know, they actually catch them.
[03:52.000 --> 03:56.000]  They don't and they want to just whitewash it and say, oh, they're not suspects with black backpacks
[03:56.000 --> 03:59.000]  right where the backpacks were left minutes before the bombing.
[03:59.000 --> 04:02.000]  No, they're not suspects, she said before Congress.
[04:02.000 --> 04:05.000]  But we do we do want your help finding them.
[04:05.000 --> 04:09.000]  This is almost a day after we show it. We say that's the main suspects.
[04:09.000 --> 04:13.000]  And of course, I got attacked by neocons. I'm not going to give them any attention.
[04:13.000 --> 04:16.000]  But you know who they are, that I'm crazy. Yeah, I'm crazy.
[04:16.000 --> 04:21.000]  Like a big old red fox with a white tail, buddy. Yeah, that's how crazy I am.
[04:21.000 --> 04:24.000]  I mean, this is this is two plus two equals four, though.
[04:24.000 --> 04:27.000]  I mean, Mama didn't raise a fool. I didn't fall off a turnip truck last.
[04:27.000 --> 04:29.000]  Yeah, I was born in the dark, but it wasn't last night.
[04:29.000 --> 04:31.000]  Every other old Texas cliche.
[04:31.000 --> 04:34.000]  But this is a no brainer if you study false flags, staged events.
[04:34.000 --> 04:38.000]  By the way, Adan Salazar has a article coming up at Infowars.com
[04:38.000 --> 04:41.000]  showing the analytics from Google on false flag.
[04:41.000 --> 04:44.000]  It is one of the top terms in America right now.
[04:44.000 --> 04:47.000]  People looking up what a false flag is.
[04:47.000 --> 04:50.000]  Harry Reid freaked out and said, how dare you say it's a false flag?
[04:50.000 --> 04:54.000]  They're panicking. They know more and more people are looking at them.
[04:54.000 --> 04:57.000]  And I was just watching the governor and all them soaking up
[04:57.000 --> 05:03.000]  like acting like rock stars loving the attention right now at the memorial service.
[05:03.000 --> 05:05.000]  It's truly disgusting.
[05:07.000 --> 05:12.000]  Devastating events like earthquakes, tornadoes, floods, hurricanes or the threat of martial law
[05:12.000 --> 05:16.000]  have highlighted the need for Americans to prepare for emergencies.
[05:16.000 --> 05:20.000]  As a result, millions are stockpiling food, gold and weapons.
[05:20.000 --> 05:24.000]  But how will these items help if you or one of your loved ones becomes ill?
[05:24.000 --> 05:29.000]  Supernatural Silver is the ultimate tool to prepare you for a medical emergency.

[07:07.000 --> 07:10.000]  Alex Jones here with a message to fellow freedom lovers.
[07:10.000 --> 07:15.000]  The prognosis for the entire planetary economic system runs from bad to worse.
[07:15.000 --> 07:20.000]  The globalist model is to shut down societies and starve patriots out
[07:20.000 --> 07:22.000]  until they acquiesce to the global takeover.
[07:22.000 --> 07:26.000]  That's why we've assembled the most vital and important preparedness items
[07:26.000 --> 07:28.000]  at infowarshop.com.
[07:28.000 --> 07:32.000]  These are items that I did research on, that I personally use.
[07:32.000 --> 07:37.000]  You've got the LifeStraw so you can turn fetid water into safe water anywhere you go.
[07:37.000 --> 07:41.000]  The Ktor Handcrank Generator to charge up key equipment during power outages
[07:41.000 --> 07:42.000]  or out in the field.
[07:42.000 --> 07:45.000]  Strategic Relocation Third Edition by Joel Skousen.

[08:05.000 --> 08:08.000]  infowarsshop.com
[08:11.000 --> 08:14.000]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[08:14.000 --> 08:19.000]  It's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[08:19.000 --> 08:22.000]  Nobody rides for free.
[08:22.000 --> 08:24.000]  Nobody rides for free.
[08:24.000 --> 08:27.000]  Nobody rides for free.
[08:27.000 --> 08:30.000]  Nobody rides for free.
[08:30.000 --> 08:34.000]  Nobody rides for free.
[08:34.000 --> 08:37.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is Thursday, the 18th day.
[08:37.000 --> 08:38.000]  The day before.
[08:38.000 --> 08:40.000]  The real Patriots day.
[08:40.000 --> 08:42.000]  The day before Lexington and Concord.
[08:42.000 --> 08:46.000]  And we are broadcasting worldwide.
[08:46.000 --> 08:48.000]  I am your guest.
[08:48.000 --> 08:50.000]  I am your host, Alex Jones.
[08:50.000 --> 08:52.000]  We do have some guests coming up.
[08:52.000 --> 08:58.000]  Max Keyes is going to be joining us at the bottom of the next hour.
[08:58.000 --> 09:04.000]  And we are going to be breaking down all of the massive news that has been unfolding on
[09:04.000 --> 09:12.000]  the Second Amendment front with a fertilizer factory up by Waco, exploding spectacularly
[09:12.000 --> 09:15.000]  and killing between 10 and 70 people.
[09:15.000 --> 09:17.000]  There's different numbers coming out.
[09:17.000 --> 09:22.000]  Incidentally, there's a big statewide drill going on yesterday and today there with helicopters
[09:22.000 --> 09:25.000]  and ambulances and everything at the nearby hospital.
[09:25.000 --> 09:29.000]  But probably just fertilizer catching on fire and exploding.
[09:29.000 --> 09:33.000]  So all of this is obviously important.
[09:33.000 --> 09:41.000]  But the magnitude of what we are about to cover here today is of undoubtedly, undoubtedly
[09:41.000 --> 09:44.000]  is the culmination of 18 years of my work so far.
[09:44.000 --> 09:46.000]  This is the culmination.
[09:46.000 --> 09:50.000]  This is everything we've been working towards, everything we've been building towards to
[09:50.000 --> 09:57.000]  have a platform to be able to expose false flag staged events when they happen.
[09:57.000 --> 10:06.000]  That is everything that I have been working for as hard as I can.
[10:06.000 --> 10:11.000]  And that's why I've been criticized so much because power structures out there want to
[10:11.000 --> 10:17.000]  be able to provocateur events, wind up patsies, wind up mentally ill people, stage events,
[10:17.000 --> 10:19.000]  allow events to happen.
[10:19.000 --> 10:20.000]  Different types.
[10:20.000 --> 10:26.000]  And even though this is a historical well-known fact and is in mainline history books on intelligence
[10:26.000 --> 10:32.000]  operations, Operation Gladio, Ajax, Gulf of Tonkin, Northwoods, the list goes on and on.
[10:32.000 --> 10:37.000]  The NATO option, Hitler and the Reichstag, Operation Himmler, Operation Gleiwitz.
[10:37.000 --> 10:39.000]  Gleiwitz was part of Operation Himmler.
[10:39.000 --> 10:41.000]  I mean, look this up.
[10:41.000 --> 10:45.000]  There's Pulitzer Prize winning books on Nuremberg about this.
[10:45.000 --> 10:47.000]  Shearer's Rise and Fall, the Third Reich.
[10:47.000 --> 10:48.000]  You may have heard of it.
[10:48.000 --> 10:52.000]  And I get up here and say, hey, this is what goes on.
[10:52.000 --> 10:53.000]  This is what happens.
[10:53.000 --> 11:00.000]  So I think the best way to go over this today is to start at the beginning of what happened.
[11:00.000 --> 11:04.000]  Anonymous, and that's all they want to be known as.
[11:04.000 --> 11:07.000]  Anonymous has contacted us as well.
[11:07.000 --> 11:12.000]  And it is the I mean, a real group affiliated with a white hat anonymous and said, have
[11:12.000 --> 11:15.000]  you seen this data dump of photos and videos?
[11:15.000 --> 11:19.000]  This shows what appears to be Navy SEALs.
[11:19.000 --> 11:22.000]  And that was one of the data dumps I hadn't even gotten to yet.
[11:22.000 --> 11:24.000]  And I saw it was Navy SEALs.
[11:24.000 --> 11:27.000]  And it shows what looks like Saudi nationals.
[11:27.000 --> 11:30.000]  And it shows what looks like the patsies.
[11:30.000 --> 11:33.000]  And sure enough, it's dead on analysis.
[11:33.000 --> 11:36.000]  It shows the redneck patsies.
[11:36.000 --> 11:38.000]  And that's how intelligence operations work.
[11:38.000 --> 11:41.000]  The feds had Iraqis.
[11:41.000 --> 11:44.000]  They had German intelligence.
[11:44.000 --> 11:47.000]  They had special forces people like McVeigh.
[11:47.000 --> 11:50.000]  And all this was caught on 17 surveillance cameras.
[11:50.000 --> 11:55.000]  And later FBI agents went public in the LA Times and said, we've seen the confiscated
[11:55.000 --> 12:00.000]  17 VHS tapes from the surrounding YMCA and others.
[12:00.000 --> 12:03.000]  And the one from the federal building right above the Ryder truck.
[12:03.000 --> 12:05.000]  It was McVeigh with six other men.
[12:05.000 --> 12:10.000]  And then we've identified who those six other men are by name.
[12:10.000 --> 12:16.000]  Justice Department, ATF people, and a famous German intelligence agent of their counterterrorism
[12:16.000 --> 12:20.000]  unit, who was then positively identified by police officers we've interviewed.
[12:20.000 --> 12:25.000]  And Jane Graham, who was also in HUD, and actually saw them planting bombs because she
[12:25.000 --> 12:30.000]  would use one of the side entrances for exercise to go up the stairs.
[12:30.000 --> 12:31.000]  But we've had her on before.
[12:31.000 --> 12:34.000]  The point is she would use the stairs to go in and out.
[12:34.000 --> 12:36.000]  And the day before, saw them planting the gray butter.
[12:36.000 --> 12:38.000]  And they're like, we're just doing some phone work.
[12:38.000 --> 12:45.000]  And she was struck by how handsome one particular gentleman was in the black cowboy hat.
[12:45.000 --> 12:49.000]  And that's why she locked eyes with him for quite a bit.
[12:49.000 --> 12:51.000]  And she was thunderstruck.
[12:51.000 --> 12:53.000]  I mean, women are attracted to powerful, aggressive men.
[12:53.000 --> 12:57.000]  And so she was kind of thunderstruck and really locked on.
[12:57.000 --> 13:00.000]  And they're like, you can go on now, honey.
[13:00.000 --> 13:02.000]  We got something for you tomorrow, though.
[13:02.000 --> 13:05.000]  And again, we know the names.
[13:05.000 --> 13:07.000]  We know who the people are.
[13:07.000 --> 13:10.000]  The FBI came in to Don Browning, the head of the K-9 unit.
[13:10.000 --> 13:13.000]  He was one of the officers that first responded and said, you and your wife are going to get
[13:13.000 --> 13:16.000]  killed if you don't shut your fat mouth, Browning.
[13:16.000 --> 13:20.000]  Of course, Terrence Yakey, cop of the year, he saved a bunch of people.
[13:20.000 --> 13:25.000]  Big black linebacker guy, carried him out on his back.
[13:25.000 --> 13:26.000]  They killed him.
[13:26.000 --> 13:29.000]  And he called his partner and said, I got feds behind me.
[13:29.000 --> 13:30.000]  And I'll see you back at the storage shed.
[13:30.000 --> 13:32.000]  I've got the material.
[13:32.000 --> 13:34.000]  And they told Yakey, I've talked to his family.
[13:34.000 --> 13:39.000]  They said, we're going to kill you if you don't shut up.
[13:39.000 --> 13:42.000]  And they tortured him really bad, tortured him to death.
[13:42.000 --> 13:44.000]  And of course, that's the Justice Department.
[13:44.000 --> 13:46.000]  That's basically the same people that are in charge today.
[13:46.000 --> 13:48.000]  And they're not playing games.
[13:48.000 --> 13:50.000]  So let me explain something.
[13:50.000 --> 13:55.000]  What we're covering here is unprecedented in American history because of the high technology
[13:55.000 --> 13:56.000]  we've got now.
[13:56.000 --> 13:59.000]  They're still following an old game plan.
[13:59.000 --> 14:01.000]  And I want to explain something.
[14:01.000 --> 14:02.000]  They monitor this show.
[14:02.000 --> 14:03.000]  That's on record.
[14:03.000 --> 14:08.000]  Five minutes after we broke this yesterday at noon central, high noon, I walked out and
[14:08.000 --> 14:12.000]  had three TVs on, two in here and one in the pantry, in the break room.
[14:12.000 --> 14:19.000]  And I watched CNN and MSNBC, the reporters while their guests were talking, getting messages
[14:19.000 --> 14:21.000]  in their ears.
[14:21.000 --> 14:27.000]  And I saw the adrenaline rush, like when you catch burglars in your house or something.
[14:27.000 --> 14:29.000]  And I knew what was about to come out of their mouth.
[14:29.000 --> 14:32.000]  And I ran back in here and I said, watch this.
[14:32.000 --> 14:35.000]  And I knew what they were gonna say next out of their mouth, cuz live time they were listening
[14:35.000 --> 14:36.000]  to us.
[14:36.000 --> 14:37.000]  It's five minutes later.
[14:37.000 --> 14:41.000]  And Blitzer goes, they've now arrested a suspect and they've got photos.
[14:41.000 --> 14:44.000]  They're gonna be releasing photos very soon.
[14:44.000 --> 14:46.000]  And I went on air and I said, I just saw them freak out.
[14:46.000 --> 14:48.000]  They're going to release photos.
[14:48.000 --> 14:52.000]  But I said, if they're smart, I guess they were listening to that.
[14:52.000 --> 14:55.000]  They actually won't, cuz now we're gonna be able to point out everybody else in the other
[14:55.000 --> 15:00.000]  photos, the Navy SEALs, the Saudis that were getting ready to go with the good old boy
[15:00.000 --> 15:01.000]  angle.
[15:01.000 --> 15:06.000]  The media run by the White House, MSNBC, Media Matters, all of them, had already come out
[15:06.000 --> 15:07.000]  and said, it will be a white person.
[15:07.000 --> 15:09.000]  It's a lone wolf.
[15:09.000 --> 15:12.000]  Janet Napolitano had said that, Axelrod, the fix was in.
[15:12.000 --> 15:15.000]  And ladies and gentlemen, we blew their op.
[15:15.000 --> 15:19.000]  And I'm sitting there with the bumper music already playing to come in here.
[15:19.000 --> 15:20.000]  Paul Watson's waiting.
[15:20.000 --> 15:22.000]  And I'm looking at that TV.
[15:22.000 --> 15:25.000]  Guys, you can use the internal camera in there if you wanna aim at the TV and show people.
[15:25.000 --> 15:29.000]  I'm looking at that TV with it turned up, standing there as the bumper music's playing.
[15:29.000 --> 15:34.000]  And I know what's about to come, I know what Blitzer's being told.
[15:34.000 --> 15:35.000]  This is incredible.
[15:35.000 --> 15:36.000]  This is beyond a movie.
[15:36.000 --> 15:40.000]  And sure enough, he says right out of his mouth, well, they've got some photos of some
[15:40.000 --> 15:42.000]  of the suspects right there near the finish line.
[15:42.000 --> 15:44.000]  They're gonna be releasing, they need our help with.
[15:44.000 --> 15:47.000]  And then by the next break, they talked about the arrest.
[15:47.000 --> 15:51.000]  They were like, well, let's hurry up then and just roll out our John Doe number one,
[15:51.000 --> 15:52.000]  the redneck.
[15:52.000 --> 15:54.000]  But see, then they went, no, you can't do that.
[15:54.000 --> 15:57.000]  Everyone's already got the photos.
[15:57.000 --> 16:00.000]  Yeah, that's the computer screen.
[16:00.000 --> 16:03.000]  It's up above it, the TV that we have news on.
[16:03.000 --> 16:09.000]  I wanna show people that so they understand what's going on.
[16:09.000 --> 16:16.080]  So I'm watching this in live time, and then I go on air and I say, I predict they're gonna
[16:16.080 --> 16:18.400]  cancel the press conference.
[16:18.400 --> 16:21.340]  And I predict they'll wait to release stuff.
[16:21.340 --> 16:26.240]  And then now they'll jump and come out with the Saudis when they do.
[16:26.240 --> 16:29.700]  And sure enough, they've now flipped it, cuz on Oklahoma City, they were gonna either blame
[16:29.700 --> 16:32.380]  Iraqis or patriots.
[16:32.380 --> 16:34.560]  They always like to have it all there.
[16:34.560 --> 16:40.740]  And state police arrested Iraqis, they were trying to get out of the country with wiring
[16:40.740 --> 16:45.440]  and stuff in their bag at the airport.
[16:45.440 --> 16:50.280]  Iraqis that have been brought in by Clinton, that's mainstream news, look it up, 3,000
[16:50.280 --> 16:53.920]  Iraqi former intelligence people who'd really already been trained by the West in the 80s.
[16:53.920 --> 16:55.920]  They were just coming home.
[16:55.920 --> 16:58.600]  It's just off the chart.
[16:58.600 --> 17:03.280]  You're seeing like a spy movie on air right now.
[17:03.280 --> 17:06.800]  That's what's going on here.
[17:06.800 --> 17:11.880]  This is just completely and totally unprecedented in the history of media.
[17:11.880 --> 17:16.600]  Anonymous sends us this info, and then the disinfo ops come out and say, well, maybe
[17:16.600 --> 17:18.100]  the government wanted this stuff out.
[17:18.100 --> 17:20.620]  This stuff had been out on Twitter and Facebook for days.
[17:20.620 --> 17:27.160]  We went yesterday and took the images that Anonymous sent us and that Watson discovered
[17:27.160 --> 17:28.800]  and we're now in contact with them.
[17:28.800 --> 17:32.380]  We took the images, ran it through a Google image search to find where they originally
[17:32.380 --> 17:33.380]  came from.
[17:33.380 --> 17:36.120]  It will show you the originator, for those that don't know, that's been out for a couple
[17:36.120 --> 17:37.120]  of years.
[17:37.120 --> 17:40.340]  And we found the Facebooks in places where people had just uploaded this.
[17:40.340 --> 17:43.740]  So they went out, probably intelligence people that don't like what's happening, grabbed
[17:43.740 --> 17:47.720]  all this, sent it to us and said, here it is, okay, Jones?
[17:47.720 --> 17:51.720]  And then we put it out and then Drudge picked it up and it was all over.
[17:51.720 --> 17:56.860]  The beginning of the collapse of the cover up then began last night when Drudge linked
[17:56.860 --> 17:57.860]  to us.
[17:57.860 --> 18:02.100]  I went and took a few hours of sleep, woke back up at midnight, Drudge had it up.
[18:02.100 --> 18:06.460]  And it is just explosive across the Internet.
[18:06.460 --> 18:11.340]  And now you watch the body language of these people on TV and at the memorial service,
[18:11.340 --> 18:14.720]  they are completely and totally freaked out.
[18:14.720 --> 18:17.400]  And they should be, because here's the deal.
[18:17.400 --> 18:19.820]  City meeting with the Saudi foreign minister.
[18:19.820 --> 18:24.120]  They announced they're gonna deport, now they're all freaking out this Saudi who was there,
[18:24.120 --> 18:25.360]  but saying he's not a suspect.
[18:25.360 --> 18:27.860]  Now they're having to show what looks like the Saudis.
[18:27.860 --> 18:30.920]  You watch, it's gonna be Saudis.
[18:30.920 --> 18:34.700]  Now they're freaking out about that and saying, well, they're not suspects, but we wanna know
[18:34.700 --> 18:39.460]  cuz they have to, cuz everybody on the Internet's already seen this.
[18:39.460 --> 18:42.460]  Okay, so you got all that.
[18:42.460 --> 18:45.980]  And by the way, the shape in the back of that guy's bag is the exact design of the type
[18:45.980 --> 18:48.400]  of pressure cooker in the company it put out.
[18:48.400 --> 18:52.140]  There's also online comparisons to the pressure cooker.
[18:52.140 --> 18:55.100]  There's actually shots that show, you can see where the lid of the pressure cooker is
[18:55.100 --> 19:00.540]  sticking out at the back of the bag, it's the exact shape of those pressure cookers.
[19:00.540 --> 19:04.680]  I mean, this is unbelievable, and they were gonna blame gun owners yesterday.
[19:04.680 --> 19:08.220]  They were gonna have their press conference, they were gonna roll out the patsy.
[19:08.220 --> 19:10.500]  Let's see the patsy, it was actually two of them.
[19:10.500 --> 19:18.140]  Let's see the Beavis and Butthead central casting, achy breaky heart, lookalike mullet
[19:18.140 --> 19:24.420]  guy who's also got a backpack that matches the one that actually exploded with the strap.
[19:24.420 --> 19:28.140]  And let me explain how, and you've got guys hiding in doorways with black bags at the
[19:28.140 --> 19:32.420]  finish line that look like special ops.
[19:32.420 --> 19:37.500]  You've got the good old boys, there's your patsy, undoubtedly that's the guy.
[19:37.500 --> 19:40.460]  In my analysis, they had at the courthouse that they'd already arrested, they were gonna
[19:40.460 --> 19:43.540]  roll out, probably drugged up out of his mind.
[19:43.540 --> 19:47.100]  Probably the guy you see running away by the body features with his clothes half blown
[19:47.100 --> 19:48.780]  off, poor guy got set up.
[19:48.780 --> 19:51.900]  And they were gonna roll him out yesterday, but didn't, then they had to evacuate the
[19:51.900 --> 19:55.740]  courthouse to get the press out to take this guy out the back door, and he's probably in
[19:55.740 --> 19:57.980]  a cement shoes right now.
[19:57.980 --> 20:03.260]  So this is unbelievable, ladies and gentlemen, we have blown a major new world operation
[20:03.260 --> 20:04.260]  sky high.
[20:04.260 --> 20:07.780]  Oh my, it's unbelievable.

[20:38.460 --> 20:42.220]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stock workers, investment advisors won't talk about gold
[20:42.220 --> 20:43.220]  IRAs?
[20:43.220 --> 20:47.240]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value
[20:47.240 --> 20:48.940]  of gold for your retirement.
[20:48.940 --> 20:52.420]  Gold is outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.

[22:07.140 --> 22:11.220]  In the last two years alone, the U.S. has seen huge losses to our food supply.
[22:11.220 --> 22:16.380]  In 2011, storms and floods raged across the U.S., costing us $20 billion in lost crops
[22:16.380 --> 22:17.380]  alone.
[22:17.380 --> 22:20.940]  In 2012, we saw the largest drought in the country in more than 50 years.
[22:20.940 --> 22:24.780]  You may think out of sight, out of mind, and so you don't think you will be affected.

[24:11.340 --> 24:12.700]  Alex Jones here back live.
[24:12.700 --> 24:17.420]  You know, I don't want an apology from all the neocon talk show hosts that have attacked
[24:17.420 --> 24:18.420]  us.
[24:18.420 --> 24:22.780]  I just want to save our country, and so that's why it's important I point out we've been
[24:22.780 --> 24:23.780]  right.
[24:23.780 --> 24:27.300]  I confirmed we were attacked yesterday by you-know-who, the other big host that lives
[24:27.300 --> 24:32.460]  in Texas, even though today he's basically reporting what we said.
[24:32.460 --> 24:38.220]  Michael Savage reported on this and rightfully exposed, it looks like a false flag, with
[24:38.220 --> 24:42.700]  his guest in collars yesterday, so good job to Michael Savage.
[24:42.700 --> 24:48.200]  And again, it's not that I mind being attacked personally, that's just because, like Michael
[24:48.200 --> 24:51.680]  Savage said when he was on, he's going to come back on soon, that the lead sleigh dog,
[24:51.680 --> 24:54.180]  you know, has the other ones barking at his butt.
[24:54.180 --> 24:57.100]  He said a little bit different than that, but that's what's happening.
[24:57.100 --> 25:00.820]  But I don't care about being the lead sleigh dog, and I don't like it, quite frankly.
[25:00.820 --> 25:04.900]  I'd rather have everybody get what's happening, we talk about it, we expose the fact that
[25:04.900 --> 25:09.140]  government is provocateur-ing and staging events to take our liberties, and that that's
[25:09.140 --> 25:10.780]  a historical fact.
[25:10.780 --> 25:13.500]  And so even when they're real events, don't let them take your rights, because they're
[25:13.500 --> 25:16.040]  only going to use it to enslave you.
[25:16.040 --> 25:19.560]  Because I just want my children to have a future, and I have tried to put out the olive
[25:19.560 --> 25:25.500]  branch towards the neo-con conservatives, and most of them have accepted it.
[25:25.500 --> 25:31.940]  But you know what, I am just blown away right now, at what I ended up hearing yesterday
[25:31.940 --> 25:34.960]  and what Tim Fruge told me he heard.
[25:34.960 --> 25:41.500]  And then today, they say, oh, it's a cover-up for the Saudis, yeah, with Navy Seals everywhere
[25:41.500 --> 25:45.500]  and good old boys they were going to set up, I mean we've now found about 20 people with
[25:45.500 --> 25:50.460]  big black backpacks with earpieces and lanyards around their necks directing the police.
[25:50.460 --> 25:54.900]  I mean, you got guys everywhere with black backpacks, there's the Saudis right there
[25:54.900 --> 25:58.540]  with good old boys with bombs, those are the Patsies clearly.
[25:58.540 --> 26:04.140]  It's a setup, a bunch of people got killed and maimed, and we've got high def video and
[26:04.140 --> 26:11.700]  photos of it all at the finish line, crawling with Navy Seals, wearing Navy Seal hats.
[26:11.700 --> 26:14.040]  That's how dumb they think you are.
[26:14.040 --> 26:17.220]  And again, they're gonna say I'm saying the Navy Seals did it, no, they're standing there
[26:17.220 --> 26:22.160]  on walkie talkies and phones, we've got videos of them, you name it, the bomb goes off, they're
[26:22.160 --> 26:24.260]  there with the police trying to save people.
[26:24.260 --> 26:28.420]  But they're all there part of the drill that they were announcing was going on, that's
[26:28.420 --> 26:31.020]  now been confirmed.
[26:31.020 --> 26:34.900]  And then they come on and go, we've caught the guy, and then no, we haven't, and then
[26:34.900 --> 26:38.720]  the media is not, well, why did you say you caught him then?
[26:38.720 --> 26:41.780]  Or why did you shut down the courthouse where you said you had him?
[26:41.780 --> 26:44.980]  The media is all waiting to see the guy, and everybody get out, there's a bomb threat at
[26:44.980 --> 26:50.780]  the very courthouse, cuz they didn't want the media seeing where that guy went.
[26:50.780 --> 26:58.700]  The central casting redneck, I mean, the guy looks like a cross between an East Texas hillbilly
[26:58.700 --> 27:03.100]  and an Appalachian West Virginia hillbilly, and then he's got somebody else with him that's
[27:03.100 --> 27:06.860]  clearly his handler.
[27:06.860 --> 27:14.740]  And remember, folks, I said before all this happened yesterday, I said, you watch, they're
[27:14.740 --> 27:18.220]  gonna come out and say the Saudis are the people with these photos.
[27:18.220 --> 27:25.860]  And then a day later, the photos we break that we show you, and the drudge amplifies,
[27:25.860 --> 27:28.520]  Homeland Security comes out and says, here's the person of interest, and it's the very
[27:28.520 --> 27:31.340]  stills and photos we showed you yesterday.
[27:31.340 --> 27:36.020]  And no media gives us credit instead of making fun of us and attacking us, all the George
[27:36.020 --> 27:41.580]  Soros outfits are attacking us, media matters run by the White House is attacking us.
[27:41.580 --> 27:48.300]  And Glenn Beck is, mercilessly, while doing limited hangout damage control saying it must
[27:48.300 --> 27:50.820]  be the Saudis.
[27:50.820 --> 27:58.500]  So that's the credit you get for breaking the biggest story any time I could ever imagine.
[27:58.500 --> 28:02.220]  And again, I don't even wanna do this dangerous breaking of the story.
[28:02.220 --> 28:04.260]  But God is on our side.
[28:04.260 --> 28:07.660]  Sam Badandi, our East Coast reporter, makes it into the press conferences, brings up false
[28:07.660 --> 28:08.660]  flag.
[28:08.660 --> 28:11.260]  It's been in the top three search terms the last two days running.
[28:11.260 --> 28:15.100]  In fact, guys, if you go to mfallwars.com, Adan Salazar's article's up and shows the
[28:15.100 --> 28:18.540]  Google Analytics, false flag, one of the top terms in the country.
[28:18.540 --> 28:22.940]  Harry Reid's saying, you conspiracy theorists worried about false flags in his speech yesterday,
[28:22.940 --> 28:24.660]  we're gonna play that.
[28:24.660 --> 28:28.500]  They are absolutely panicking right now.
[28:28.500 --> 28:33.680]  Yeah, that's great, guys, but he has, in his article, he has the Google Analytics that
[28:33.680 --> 28:41.260]  shows the last three days as it grew up to this giant spike, Adan Salazar, mfallwars.com,
[28:41.260 --> 28:43.260]  prisonplanet.com.
[28:43.260 --> 28:47.260]  So again, this is part of an awakening of America that's happening.
[28:47.260 --> 28:51.340]  When we come back, I'm gonna play the high def, high quality audio now that we have the
[28:51.340 --> 28:55.280]  original tape, not just what was caught live on the news, of our reporter bringing it up.
[28:55.280 --> 28:59.680]  And you watch the body language of the relaxed, calm governor, the police chief, the feds,
[28:59.680 --> 29:00.680]  the ATF.
[29:00.680 --> 29:03.460]  As soon as he says, what about false flags and the drill?
[29:03.460 --> 29:08.660]  Everyone has an adrenaline rush, turns, and see, that's a criminal response.
[29:08.660 --> 29:13.960]  That's what police do when they walk up, and I'll calmly say, hey, you know, kids, anything
[29:13.960 --> 29:17.540]  about beer taken out of golf carts?
[29:17.540 --> 29:19.420]  And then they see the kids jolt.
[29:19.420 --> 29:24.340]  It's that real, this is basic police work, folks, they all jolt, whoa, the drill, false
[29:24.340 --> 29:25.340]  flag?
[29:25.340 --> 29:31.180]  No, the governor, no, his eyes all light up, no, next question, and they all start shaking.
[29:31.180 --> 29:35.340]  We're on national TV, cuz if you could guarantee the governor wasn't there with the plunger,
[29:35.340 --> 29:36.340]  he didn't know what happened.
[29:36.340 --> 29:39.200]  He just knows there's a drill, don't worry Homeland Security is explaining it to him
[29:39.200 --> 29:40.200]  right now.
[29:40.200 --> 29:43.700]  You know, they won't release the people out of the hospital unless they've already been
[29:43.700 --> 29:46.740]  briefed and stuff, they pulled an army runner out of the race.
[29:46.740 --> 29:50.780]  We're gonna come back and break down what this means, what it signifies, that their
[29:50.780 --> 29:54.940]  whole operation's been blown right now, and what are they probably gonna do next?
[29:54.940 --> 29:57.020]  This could bring them down.
[29:57.020 --> 30:08.100]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run, Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[30:08.100 --> 30:12.820]  You prepare by purchasing gold, food, and firearms, but if you don't have a home security

[32:11.540 --> 32:12.780]  Tyranny is here.
[32:12.780 --> 32:16.420]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[32:16.420 --> 32:19.120]  It really says that the state is God.
[32:19.120 --> 32:23.660]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most impressive police states
[32:23.660 --> 32:24.900]  on earth.
[32:24.900 --> 32:29.700]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps now being
[32:29.700 --> 32:31.540]  expanded nationwide.
[32:31.540 --> 32:36.240]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful
[32:36.240 --> 32:37.660]  shadow state.
[32:37.660 --> 32:41.660]  Police state four chronicles the sickening depths to which our republic has fallen.

[32:47.820 --> 32:51.940]  citizen spies, staged terror, and cameras on every street corner.
[32:51.940 --> 32:55.420]  It's only the beginning of the new world order's hellish plan.
[32:55.420 --> 32:57.460]  The police state isn't coming.
[32:57.460 --> 32:58.460]  It's here.
[32:58.460 --> 33:15.820]  Secure your copy today at Infowars.com or see it online in the highest quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[33:15.820 --> 33:28.020]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[33:28.020 --> 33:32.100]  There's no doubt, ladies and gentlemen, that this republic and our liberties and our freedoms
[33:32.100 --> 33:37.260]  are in the danger zone, but it's always been my intention knowing about the globalist program
[33:37.260 --> 33:44.820]  to build an operation, a resistance, and a core of people that are aware of the globalist
[33:44.820 --> 33:48.100]  program and are aware of its tricks to challenge them.
[33:48.100 --> 33:52.580]  And then in the time of greatest threat, we'll have a core group, cadres, in every town and
[33:52.580 --> 33:56.820]  city that know what to look for so that we can expose their operations.
[33:56.820 --> 34:02.540]  And now every false flag they have, our operatives, which are just liberty-loving people, are
[34:02.540 --> 34:03.540]  there.
[34:03.540 --> 34:06.460]  We catch the government getting the underwear bomber on the plane, blow that operation for
[34:06.460 --> 34:07.460]  them.
[34:07.460 --> 34:10.180]  It even came out in Congress a month and a half after we broke it and told you here with
[34:10.180 --> 34:11.180]  the eyewitnesses.
[34:11.180 --> 34:13.820]  It's the same thing with this operation.
[34:13.820 --> 34:15.500]  It's the same thing with so many others.
[34:15.500 --> 34:24.260]  The truth is, in this universe, good actually has the advantage if you'll take the field.
[34:24.260 --> 34:26.340]  Providence smiles on you.
[34:26.340 --> 34:31.080]  But if you don't fight it, if you don't take the steps, then you'll never defeat evil.
[34:31.080 --> 34:35.900]  And people have just decided, you're evil, you're wearing a uniform, you're the government,
[34:35.900 --> 34:40.580]  you're Wolf Blitzer, you're Chris Matthews.
[34:40.580 --> 34:46.180]  I have a clip coming up of MSNBC saying the Second Amendment did the bombing.
[34:46.180 --> 34:47.460]  You're like, that doesn't make sense.
[34:47.460 --> 34:50.940]  Well, saying if you don't support Obamacare, you're racist doesn't either.
[34:50.940 --> 34:59.340]  They're trying to dumb the whole debate down to saying, hey, there is no Family Guy episode
[34:59.340 --> 35:03.660]  where they bomb the Boston Marathon, which there is.
[35:03.660 --> 35:07.100]  By the way, I looked this up this morning and it completely blew me away at Don Salazar's
[35:07.100 --> 35:08.100]  posting it.
[35:08.100 --> 35:17.140]  Did you know that the marathon ended, the tape ended at, what is it, 666 Boyd Street?
[35:17.140 --> 35:20.540]  And we'll put that up.
[35:20.540 --> 35:22.660]  Boylston Street, 666 Boylston Street.
[35:22.660 --> 35:25.020]  I mean, just the weirdness of all of this.
[35:25.020 --> 35:27.860]  And it's so many times stuff like this happens.
[35:27.860 --> 35:34.300]  That's the psychopaths leaving their little calling card for you right there.
[35:34.300 --> 35:38.960]  And again, not everything is a conspiracy, but big, massive events like this.
[35:38.960 --> 35:43.700]  You better believe, you better believe they're orchestrated.
[35:43.700 --> 35:46.460]  Now, let's go to the false flag article.
[35:46.460 --> 35:52.660]  Can you guys put the false flag article up that Don Salazar just posted at Infowars.com?
[35:52.660 --> 35:56.480]  Let's show TV viewers, if you're a radio listener, just go to Infowars.com.
[35:56.480 --> 36:02.540]  There is, over the last nine years of Google Analytics, the top search terms for false
[36:02.540 --> 36:04.140]  flag.
[36:04.140 --> 36:09.560]  Going back to what, 2003 or so.
[36:09.560 --> 36:15.320]  So you can see there on the graph, it is 100 times the number of people roughly are searching
[36:15.320 --> 36:17.660]  it that have ever searched it before.
[36:17.660 --> 36:25.980]  100 times the people are searching false flag than they did before.
[36:25.980 --> 36:29.900]  And Harry Reid, when he got mad about not being able to ban our guns in the Senate,
[36:29.900 --> 36:31.620]  vowed to reintroduce more bills.
[36:31.620 --> 36:36.540]  And don't worry, they'll get some more drugged up patsies wound up right now to teach you
[36:36.540 --> 36:37.540]  that it's your fault.
[36:37.540 --> 36:43.380]  But he said, how dare the black helicopter crowd talk about false flags.
[36:43.380 --> 36:46.540]  And other globalists are talking about false flags now.
[36:46.540 --> 36:51.720]  They are panicking because the idea that hey, who else could be involved?
[36:51.720 --> 36:56.260]  Not just who you tell me could be involved, you've got a history of being involved.
[36:56.260 --> 37:00.160]  And don't Stonewall us on this, you stand to gain from this.
[37:00.160 --> 37:05.940]  And why are there these videos and photos of rednecks with black backpacks looking suspicious?
[37:05.940 --> 37:08.420]  Of Saudis with black backpacks looking suspicious?
[37:08.420 --> 37:13.900]  Middle Eastern men clearly, they look like Saudis to me, the phenotype or whatever you
[37:13.900 --> 37:15.080]  call it.
[37:15.080 --> 37:17.100]  And you've got what are Navy SEALs?
[37:17.100 --> 37:21.220]  It's not just the gray, not just the tan pants, the tan combat boots, the black shirts.
[37:21.220 --> 37:25.520]  I mean, it's the bearing, I've seen Navy SEALs, they look just like Chris Kyle.
[37:25.520 --> 37:27.060]  It's an exact type they go for.
[37:27.060 --> 37:30.380]  You go watch Zero Dark Thirty, that's what the SEALs look like.
[37:30.380 --> 37:35.220]  I mean, they go for a certain type, and they're all there crawling all over it.
[37:35.220 --> 37:40.980]  They are crawling all over it, hiding in doorways with black backpacks, directing the police.
[37:40.980 --> 37:46.660]  We have video of what looks like about a 50-year-old SEAL in the same outfit directing police right
[37:46.660 --> 37:47.660]  after the bombing.
[37:47.660 --> 37:51.900]  We've got what looks like, that guy looks like an old grizzled 50-year-old Green Beret.
[37:51.900 --> 37:54.840]  I just learned the looks of these guys from their eras.
[37:54.840 --> 37:58.220]  That guy looks like Delta Force or something, crouching there with a big black backpack
[37:58.220 --> 38:00.180]  right before the bombs go off.
[38:00.180 --> 38:08.460]  I mean, you've got guys everywhere with black backpacks, spec ops, with just all this stuff
[38:08.460 --> 38:12.420]  going on, and they did not want this out.
[38:12.420 --> 38:15.900]  That's why they pushed up their timeline and announced the arrest, but then figured out
[38:15.900 --> 38:20.040]  that wasn't gonna work, cuz they're not just gonna roll out the good old boy.
[38:20.040 --> 38:23.800]  And now I looked at Janet Napolitano, she looked like a deer in the headlights, like
[38:23.800 --> 38:29.120]  she was completely freaked out and on methamphetamine today during the congressional hearing, where
[38:29.120 --> 38:33.220]  she said, we do have two photos of men of interest, the photos we showed you yesterday.
[38:33.220 --> 38:35.180]  I'm gonna say that again.
[38:35.180 --> 38:40.700]  You know the New York Times or CNN or Fox News said, hey, look at these photos we found.
[38:40.700 --> 38:41.700]  Don't these look suspicious?
[38:41.700 --> 38:47.060]  They'll show you a guy on the roof all day and say, who is it, who could it be?
[38:47.060 --> 38:49.180]  Because there it's all blurred and you can't tell.
[38:49.180 --> 38:55.520]  But for a day, there are these photos and videos and none of them will show it until
[38:55.520 --> 39:00.100]  the government says, now it's okay to show this.
[39:00.100 --> 39:03.420]  And they show you some photos that we already showed you.
[39:03.420 --> 39:09.460]  And no one gives us credit, instead there are hundreds of hit pieces saying I'm crazy
[39:09.460 --> 39:11.700]  and dangerous yesterday and today.
[39:11.700 --> 39:13.640]  You know why I'm crazy and dangerous?
[39:13.640 --> 39:17.740]  Because I've got my head screwed on, ladies and gentlemen, and I'm not stupid.
[39:17.740 --> 39:19.180]  And you're not stupid either.
[39:19.180 --> 39:22.020]  I know it's scary to admit this to yourself.
[39:22.020 --> 39:24.580]  I understand it's easier just to be in denial.
[39:24.580 --> 39:29.060]  But come on, I'm the one that's publicly up here tip of the spear doing all this.
[39:29.060 --> 39:34.460]  The least you can do is speak up for us, promote our links, our videos, what we're doing so
[39:34.460 --> 39:36.980]  that if I get destroyed, it isn't in vain.
[39:36.980 --> 39:38.540]  Cuz I'm not afraid of being killed.
[39:38.540 --> 39:39.780]  I'm not afraid of being tortured.
[39:39.780 --> 39:44.160]  I'm not afraid of being politically destroyed and called names and ridiculed because I care
[39:44.160 --> 39:46.800]  about the future and my children.
[39:46.800 --> 39:51.060]  That is a male instinct to not care when you know you're right and to feel sorry for the
[39:51.060 --> 39:52.460]  people that attack you.
[39:52.460 --> 39:54.260]  And it does hurt me.
[39:54.260 --> 39:58.780]  It does hurt me when even though we broke all this, mainline big talk show hosts who
[39:58.780 --> 40:03.540]  claim they're libertarian are attacking me because it hurts me for my children.
[40:03.540 --> 40:09.580]  I need those people to not be bad operatives probably now and to stand up for America and
[40:09.580 --> 40:10.980]  put this news out.
[40:10.980 --> 40:17.560]  Cuz if this news was put out by Glenn Beck, instead of limited, it's Saudis, Obama's covering
[40:17.560 --> 40:19.540]  up for Saudis, which is going on.
[40:19.540 --> 40:20.540]  That's part of it.
[40:20.540 --> 40:22.820]  If he went, why are there Navy Seals?
[40:22.820 --> 40:24.700]  Why are there people in doorways?
[40:24.700 --> 40:26.340]  Why do they have black backpacks?
[40:26.340 --> 40:31.020]  Who are these good old boys whose backpack matches the bomb that went off?
[40:31.020 --> 40:34.580]  They have the shot of the shattered black backpack with the same black, same silver
[40:34.580 --> 40:35.980]  stripe, all of it.
[40:35.980 --> 40:40.260]  Of the guys that were right there where the bombs went off, and it looks like the Patsy
[40:40.260 --> 40:44.780]  when you see the explosion, he runs with his clothes half blown off like a cartoon character.
[40:44.780 --> 40:49.020]  When Yosemite Sam has the bomb go off, that's what it really looks like when a bomb goes
[40:49.020 --> 40:50.340]  off close to you.
[40:50.340 --> 40:53.220]  You see him running, probably set up.
[40:53.220 --> 40:54.660]  That's probably their suspect.
[40:54.660 --> 40:56.020]  They had him at the courthouse.
[40:56.020 --> 40:58.420]  They were gonna roll him out and they canceled it.
[40:58.420 --> 41:00.300]  And again, this is not my speculation.
[41:00.300 --> 41:05.420]  I told you yesterday that these are the photos of the Saudis.
[41:05.420 --> 41:10.620]  And then now today, it's in congressional hearings, the photos of the Saudis.
[41:10.620 --> 41:12.100]  Now are you gonna listen to me?
[41:12.100 --> 41:13.580]  Because I am immersed in this.
[41:13.580 --> 41:15.060]  This is all I do.
[41:15.060 --> 41:20.260]  I went to bed yesterday at about seven, went and saw my children, went to bed, woke up
[41:20.260 --> 41:21.740]  at midnight, went back to work.
[41:21.740 --> 41:27.020]  And while I dreamed, I was working out these problems in my head.
[41:27.020 --> 41:31.260]  I was at work while I was sleeping, totally concentrating, and I'm not even trained to
[41:31.260 --> 41:32.260]  do this.
[41:32.260 --> 41:33.260]  They can train people to do this.
[41:33.260 --> 41:36.100]  My dad took a course on it in college, was actually able to control his dreams and do
[41:36.100 --> 41:37.300]  homework on his dreams and stuff.
[41:37.300 --> 41:42.300]  But the point is, I was working while I was asleep on this, okay?
[41:42.300 --> 41:46.340]  I've been on video editing projects before that are real long and hard, and you start
[41:46.340 --> 41:48.100]  doing the video editing in your mind when you're asleep.
[41:48.100 --> 41:50.180]  The point is, is that I eat, drink, and sleep this.
[41:50.180 --> 41:51.300]  That's where that term comes from.
[41:51.300 --> 41:53.420]  I eat, drink, and sleep this.
[41:53.420 --> 41:57.140]  And now I need to be able to settle down.
[41:57.140 --> 41:59.700]  I need to be able to have a break today, and I'll probably be able to do that by the nightly
[41:59.700 --> 42:00.700]  news.
[42:00.700 --> 42:03.420]  I'll be home for about an hour.
[42:03.420 --> 42:06.740]  That's why a psychologist will have you lay on a couch, cuz you can get reflective and
[42:06.740 --> 42:07.740]  think.
[42:07.740 --> 42:18.220]  I need to go lay on a couch in my office for about an hour, and I need to think about what
[42:18.220 --> 42:23.580]  they're gonna do next and what they're thinking about and what they're planning.
[42:23.580 --> 42:27.260]  That's what I have to do, because right now I'm so focused on this.
[42:27.260 --> 42:32.480]  So two days ago, a congressional bipartisan commission said there was a systematic order
[42:32.480 --> 42:38.900]  of torture, including children, by Bush and by Obama, and a deliberate attempt to cover
[42:38.900 --> 42:45.540]  it up and continue to order the military to engage in hardcore Class A felonies.
[42:45.540 --> 42:47.220]  Punishable by death, by the way.
[42:47.220 --> 42:50.820]  That is the punishment for torturing people to death, including children.
[42:50.820 --> 42:55.660]  The Army report, again, came out 2006, the Tugumbu report.
[42:55.660 --> 43:00.180]  Its own government's report admitted the torture of children until death, unto death in front
[43:00.180 --> 43:01.180]  of their parents.
[43:01.180 --> 43:05.160]  And see, the government right now is having a come to Jesus moment, cuz they all play
[43:05.160 --> 43:06.160]  it being tough.
[43:06.160 --> 43:07.660]  They all play it being evil.
[43:07.660 --> 43:13.260]  They all play it doing hardcore stuff, but becoming evil to guard good and that old Machiavellian
[43:13.260 --> 43:18.140]  lie of guard the truth with lies and be more evil than the devil to protect good.
[43:18.140 --> 43:21.880]  You don't protect good, you become the devil.
[43:21.880 --> 43:24.020]  And you lose providence when you do that.
[43:24.020 --> 43:25.780]  You lose God's hedge of protection.
[43:25.780 --> 43:28.060]  It's a curse on our land to have these leaders.
[43:28.060 --> 43:31.260]  And people are looking at their grandkids right now, and they're looking at where all
[43:31.260 --> 43:36.000]  this is going, and they're figuring out they're gonna be destroyed in this as well.
[43:36.000 --> 43:39.260]  No one's getting out of this.
[43:39.260 --> 43:41.260]  No one gets away with this stuff.
[43:41.260 --> 43:44.100]  Mao was basically taken out at the end.
[43:44.100 --> 43:46.260]  His wife was locked up in prison.
[43:46.260 --> 43:52.340]  Even the communist Chinese didn't like him killing between 65 and 84 million people.
[43:52.340 --> 43:54.140]  How do you are gonna get away with this?
[43:54.140 --> 43:59.260]  I mean, it's a law of human instinct that your own people are gonna start turning against
[43:59.260 --> 44:00.260]  you.
[44:00.260 --> 44:04.220]  And again, he's a Star Wars analogy like Darth Vader throwing Emperor Palpatine down the
[44:04.220 --> 44:05.660]  reactor shaft.
[44:05.660 --> 44:07.980]  You are not going to get away with this.
[44:07.980 --> 44:11.180]  You need to understand that.
[44:11.180 --> 44:18.820]  And later, at the start of the next hour, I wanna talk to the globalist.
[44:18.820 --> 44:21.700]  I thought about this this morning in a moment of clarity.
[44:21.700 --> 44:29.500]  I have a message to the globalist that we're gonna be going over and getting to.
[44:29.500 --> 44:32.060]  Coming up at the start of the next hour, the next cause is gonna pop in with us on some
[44:32.060 --> 44:33.060]  other issues.
[44:33.060 --> 44:35.540]  But really, there is no other issue but this.
[44:35.540 --> 44:38.820]  And again, they don't want these photos out.
[44:38.820 --> 44:40.540]  People keep believing that we can't win.
[44:40.540 --> 44:44.620]  People keep believing that the enemy is superhuman and impossible to beat.
[44:44.620 --> 44:47.260]  Good people are smarter than evil people.
[44:47.260 --> 44:54.340]  When we stop being naive and foolish and turn our minds towards understanding the enemy.
[44:54.340 --> 44:59.140]  And all you've got to do is put yourself in their shoes and what they've done in a Pavlovian,
[44:59.140 --> 45:01.500]  pathological way in the past.
[45:01.500 --> 45:06.180]  Because criminals are obsessive if they're anything.
[45:06.180 --> 45:16.740]  Psychopaths, sociopaths, masochists, sadists, these people are all pathological.
[45:16.740 --> 45:20.420]  You wonder why the culture is so dark, so evil, even though it doesn't even get ratings
[45:20.420 --> 45:21.420]  now.
[45:21.420 --> 45:25.940]  They still keep pushing the most evil stuff that you can imagine.
[45:25.940 --> 45:28.760]  You wonder why all that is going on.
[45:28.760 --> 45:31.380]  That's because they're showing you what they like.
[45:31.380 --> 45:33.420]  They're trying to make our world like their world.
[45:33.420 --> 45:39.100]  But you have a show like the Bible with 15, 20 million viewers on cable when nothing gets
[45:39.100 --> 45:41.560]  even 2 million viewers.
[45:41.560 --> 45:43.220]  People are hungry for wholesomeness.
[45:43.220 --> 45:45.700]  They're hungry for good and we're force fed.
[45:45.700 --> 45:49.340]  It's like the golden child, another great analogy where the demons trying to feed the
[45:49.340 --> 45:54.700]  golden child, the sacrifice kid's blood in the oatmeal because he believes if he can
[45:54.700 --> 45:59.400]  corrupt him, that's an archetype, an allegory, then they'll be able to kill him.
[45:59.400 --> 46:01.820]  They can't kill him because he's so pure.
[46:01.820 --> 46:02.820]  It's the same thing.
[46:02.820 --> 46:08.240]  They need to corrupt you because once they've got you corrupted, they can bring you down.
[46:08.240 --> 46:12.940]  Then they have access to trespass against you.
[46:12.940 --> 46:18.500]  All you got to do is pray to God to give you providence and to give you protection.
[46:18.500 --> 46:21.620]  And even if you don't believe in this, all the medical studies show prayer really works
[46:21.620 --> 46:22.620]  for whatever reason.
[46:22.620 --> 46:27.980]  Maybe it's maybe maybe if you're a secular, it's giving your brain a command.
[46:27.980 --> 46:30.020]  You're guardian angels around you.
[46:30.020 --> 46:33.980]  Maybe you don't believe in that, even though every culture has near death or death experiences
[46:33.980 --> 46:35.580]  and sees the same thing.
[46:35.580 --> 46:40.340]  A biblical type event, even with villages that have never seen TV, don't know the Christian
[46:40.340 --> 46:43.180]  narrative, they have that same event.
[46:43.180 --> 46:47.800]  Even if you don't believe in that, the brainwaves you put off around others, once you believe
[46:47.800 --> 46:50.820]  you have guardian angels, the guardian angels are basically there.
[46:50.820 --> 46:52.940]  And I don't mean to get off into mumbo jumbo.
[46:52.940 --> 46:56.140]  That's not what it is, ladies and gentlemen, but but it's real.
[46:56.140 --> 47:01.720]  I have guardian angels and the new world order cannot kill me unless God decides it's time
[47:01.720 --> 47:02.720]  for me to die.
[47:02.720 --> 47:08.680]  You understand that I cannot be killed until God decides and my whole life, incredible
[47:08.680 --> 47:11.460]  things have happened.
[47:11.460 --> 47:12.460]  And I'm just going to leave it at that.
[47:12.460 --> 47:14.860]  And you know, you've had those things happen in your life as well.
[47:14.860 --> 47:16.580]  You're supposed to just ignore that.
[47:16.580 --> 47:18.500]  So that's why I don't have any fear.
[47:18.500 --> 47:24.580]  My only fear is that I won't do a good enough job in this fight and that I won't perform
[47:24.580 --> 47:32.080]  to the level that that that that God has has has destined me to that my flesh is weak.
[47:32.080 --> 47:33.100]  My spirit is willing.
[47:33.100 --> 47:35.440]  My flesh is weak.
[47:35.440 --> 47:36.440]  My spirit is willing.
[47:36.440 --> 47:37.440]  My flesh is weak.
[47:37.440 --> 47:38.440]  My spirit is willing.
[47:38.440 --> 47:39.440]  My flesh is weak.
[47:39.440 --> 47:46.640]  And I ask God to strengthen my spirit so that I can overcome my flesh.
[47:46.640 --> 47:50.220]  And we are entering the ultimate time in our history.
[47:50.220 --> 47:56.200]  Let me go to this Dan Badani press conference from the night of the event.
[47:56.200 --> 48:02.720]  From the night this is from the night of the event of the Boston Marathon.
[48:02.720 --> 48:04.840]  And this is this is the this is Dan Badani.
[48:04.840 --> 48:08.620]  And you see it from his perspective at the camera with the governor and the police commissioner
[48:08.620 --> 48:13.440]  and the mayor and the and the ATF had all looking at him like they want to kill him
[48:13.440 --> 48:14.440]  instantly.
[48:14.440 --> 48:18.920]  See, if in criminology, if somebody doesn't doesn't recognize what you're saying, I've
[48:18.920 --> 48:23.000]  had cops question me before and FBI Secret Service and they're watching to see when they
[48:23.000 --> 48:27.440]  show me something, if I automatically recognize it and they're sitting there watching to see
[48:27.440 --> 48:30.160]  if I have to remember it.
[48:30.160 --> 48:31.560]  That's basic police work.
[48:31.560 --> 48:37.080]  And the minute Badani ask him, they jolt when he says the drill and the false flag and their
[48:37.080 --> 48:43.820]  eyes all come alive and they swing around and start, start, you know, I mean, guilty
[48:43.820 --> 48:46.360]  as sin, guilty as a pig.
[48:46.360 --> 48:47.360]  And you know what?
[48:47.360 --> 48:49.240]  Now, it doesn't mean they did the bombing.
[48:49.240 --> 48:50.640]  It means they know about the drill.
[48:50.640 --> 48:52.560]  They've been told, shut up.
[48:52.560 --> 48:57.540]  And the governor, the governor looks what goes from being the fake smiley guy like he
[48:57.540 --> 49:01.480]  is at the memorial service to instantly battle mode.
[49:01.480 --> 49:08.120]  His eyebrows go up, his teeth almost show, I mean, he's like if you walk up to somebody
[49:08.120 --> 49:11.180]  that you have been killing kids and put them in their backyard, you go, hey, I found those
[49:11.180 --> 49:13.240]  dead kids in your backyard, what?
[49:13.240 --> 49:15.280]  And the guy runs out the door running through the wall.
[49:15.280 --> 49:18.560]  You couldn't get the warrant to go in his backyard where you think the kids are buried,
[49:18.560 --> 49:20.840]  but you just made him run.
[49:20.840 --> 49:22.840]  Now you got him.
[49:22.840 --> 49:25.480]  This is basic police work, ladies and gentlemen.
[49:25.480 --> 49:30.040]  Badani goes up and says this to him, we're gonna come back and play it after the break.
[49:30.040 --> 49:35.880]  The video's up on infoawards.com and they totally freak out.
[49:35.880 --> 49:40.060]  They totally get scared, ladies and gentlemen, and of course there was a drill.
[49:40.060 --> 49:44.040]  We have multiple witnesses and have reinterviewed one of the witnesses, a major track coach
[49:44.040 --> 49:45.040]  of a major university.
[49:45.040 --> 49:48.600]  He said they were on the roof, they had bags, they were all around, they were right there
[49:48.600 --> 49:51.960]  saying don't worry at the start and the finish.
[49:51.960 --> 49:52.960]  He's a track coach.
[49:52.960 --> 49:58.560]  Then we have the video confirming just like Kurt Haskell said, a sharp dressed guy told
[49:58.560 --> 50:03.880]  the airport security, you're gonna put him on the plane without a passport, I don't care.
[50:03.880 --> 50:05.960]  And was so authoritative, they followed his order.
[50:05.960 --> 50:10.640]  And it turned out it was an unnamed US intelligence agency that got the authorization of the Dutch
[50:10.640 --> 50:20.920]  government in Amsterdam to get drugged out Mutallib on that aircraft.
[50:20.920 --> 50:24.080]  Then they put out a green screen video of Mutallib that was totally fake, we proved
[50:24.080 --> 50:25.080]  it.
[50:25.080 --> 50:26.680]  This is how dumb they think you are.
[50:26.680 --> 50:28.800]  They're just men like us that we're fighting.
[50:28.800 --> 50:29.840]  They're men and women like us.
[50:29.840 --> 50:34.900]  We can beat them if we have the will and if we have the courage and if we set ourselves
[50:34.900 --> 50:35.900]  against them.
[50:35.900 --> 50:37.520]  Look, I'm setting myself against you.
[50:37.520 --> 50:38.780]  I'm not gonna sleep.
[50:38.780 --> 50:42.320]  I'm gonna fight you as hard as I can and I call on the creator of the universe to give
[50:42.320 --> 50:44.200]  me discernment.
[50:44.200 --> 50:48.860]  And if it's God's will you be just defeated, then so be it.
[50:48.860 --> 50:52.440]  And maybe it's God's will that just his people see the truth and the rest of the world's
[50:52.440 --> 50:55.360]  in denial and accepts the delusion.
[50:55.360 --> 50:58.580]  I mean, they got the Saudi ambassador in emergency meetings.
[50:58.580 --> 50:59.800]  They're canceling things.
[50:59.800 --> 51:01.320]  They're evacuating courthouses.
[51:01.320 --> 51:03.080]  They are freaking out to cover this up.
[51:03.080 --> 51:08.360]  We have caught them red handed in a false flag that we're gonna blame on gun owners.
[51:08.360 --> 51:10.680]  You've heard about our MRE smorgasbord.
[51:10.680 --> 51:16.360]  Now Long Life Food Depot introduces the most unique, safe and longest lasting way to stash
[51:16.360 --> 51:19.040]  emergency food, the Eat Pod.
[51:19.040 --> 51:23.640]  Most survival food products recommend an ideal storage environment, including low temps,
[51:23.640 --> 51:28.920]  low moisture and low oxygen if you're storing in a basement too humid garages and attics
[51:28.920 --> 51:29.920]  too hot.
[51:29.920 --> 51:35.040]  But the waterproof double walled high density polyethylene patent pending eat pod is a unique
[51:35.040 --> 51:40.360]  rollaway food bunker that creates the perfect conditions can be buried up to 30 feet and

[52:07.960 --> 52:10.960]  Is this the year you finally get serious about your family's drinking water?

[52:14.560 --> 52:17.480]  Did you know that over 60% of municipal water is fluoridated?
[52:17.480 --> 52:20.720]  Berkey water filters distinguish themselves from many other filtration systems with the
[52:20.720 --> 52:24.800]  capability to significantly reduce dangerous chlorine, fluoride, arsenic and disinfection
[52:24.800 --> 52:28.520]  byproducts from municipal water via the black Berkey and PF line of filters.
[52:28.520 --> 52:31.480]  Then there's affordability at only 1.7 cents per gallon.
[52:31.480 --> 52:35.760]  Berkey water filters purify treated and untreated water, even stagnant pond water.
[52:35.760 --> 52:39.260]  Stop and think how much money you could save by simply reducing buying bottled water and
[52:39.260 --> 52:41.760]  using water filtered by your Berkey water filter.
[52:41.760 --> 52:44.520]  No need to be constantly replacing expensive filters with a Berkey.

[53:14.600 --> 53:16.640]  Soft and broken in from the start.
[53:16.640 --> 53:20.160]  Yet more rugged and durable than any jean you've ever worn.
[53:20.160 --> 53:23.200]  Have you ever experienced mis-sized jeans from China?

[54:24.920 --> 54:36.320]  Everybody knows the war is over, everybody knows the good guys lost, everybody knows
[54:36.320 --> 54:38.520]  the fight was fixed.
[54:38.520 --> 54:39.520]  We are back live again.
[54:39.520 --> 54:40.520]  Look at these headlines.
[54:40.520 --> 54:42.660]  Obama meets with Saudi foreign minister.
[54:42.660 --> 54:46.740]  They claim they discussed Syria, but this was not on the schedule.
[54:46.740 --> 54:48.160]  That's unprecedented.
[54:48.160 --> 54:52.400]  They evacuate the courthouse where they reportedly were going to be having a press conference
[54:52.400 --> 54:54.240]  where they had the suspect.
[54:54.240 --> 54:56.740]  But never mind, we don't have a suspect.
[54:56.740 --> 55:00.280]  We don't have the person that did it, we were ready to announce.
[55:00.280 --> 55:05.400]  Can't roll out the rednecks, can you?
[55:05.400 --> 55:08.980]  You had the Saudis there, you had the rednecks, you had the Navy SEALs there, you had everybody
[55:08.980 --> 55:10.440]  there with the black backpacks.
[55:10.440 --> 55:16.420]  So in case any cops happen to find the bombs, you would just say it was a drill.
[55:16.420 --> 55:18.600]  That's how you always do it.
[55:18.600 --> 55:22.720]  And again, if I was those Navy SEALs, I'm gonna tell you right now, they're either with
[55:22.720 --> 55:27.180]  Kraft International, people are saying that because it has the red Kraft symbol on the
[55:27.180 --> 55:31.280]  death's head, or it's Blackwater who uses the same symbol.
[55:31.280 --> 55:37.400]  But it's standard kind of plain dress that the SEALs wear, and it's SEALs, and experts
[55:37.400 --> 55:40.240]  are picking it up saying, yes, those are SEALs.
[55:40.240 --> 55:42.600]  But regardless, they're in charge of the police, by the way.
[55:42.600 --> 55:46.220]  Right after the bomb goes off, they've got Geiger counters and stuff, and they're out
[55:46.220 --> 55:48.020]  there directing everything.
[55:48.020 --> 55:58.120]  So you've got maybe 20 yards from the supposed bombers, you've got Navy SEALs.
[55:58.120 --> 56:01.600]  And the government isn't showing these photos, well, why not show these photos, media?
[56:01.600 --> 56:08.040]  You'd think, hey, look at these photos mfoawars.com has, look at these photos of all these people.
[56:08.040 --> 56:12.560]  You showed me a guy on a roof, what about all these guys in doorways crouched suspiciously
[56:12.560 --> 56:16.000]  with big black bags right where the bomb went off?
[56:16.000 --> 56:20.320]  Oh, but it doesn't fit the narrative of the redneck.
[56:20.320 --> 56:23.320]  You were gonna blame us for the bombing, I mean, I could see the whole buildup.
[56:23.320 --> 56:27.760]  And the controlled White House run media, MSNBC and others were saying, we told you
[56:27.760 --> 56:29.920]  it was gonna be a white tea partier.
[56:29.920 --> 56:35.280]  It's a lone wolf, Homeland Security, that's all they'll say, they're getting ready.
[56:35.280 --> 56:38.920]  We got you gun owners, we got you, we got you.
[56:38.920 --> 56:39.920]  You got us?
[56:39.920 --> 56:44.780]  Cuz I know you're watching right now all angry, most of you are foreign intelligence operatives
[56:44.780 --> 56:45.780]  and globalist.
[56:45.780 --> 56:50.320]  You're all stomping around right now at Media Matters and MSNBC, taping what I'm saying,
[56:50.320 --> 56:55.400]  hopping mad, probably, I imagine some papers have been thrown.
[56:55.400 --> 57:01.400]  And who got blown, who got defeated, who got exposed, who?
[57:01.400 --> 57:05.560]  Tell me again, and I'm not taunting these people, I want them to understand they're
[57:05.560 --> 57:07.200]  going to be defeated.
[57:07.200 --> 57:09.440]  I want you to understand you're in the wrong.
[57:09.440 --> 57:13.600]  I want you to understand what you did to frame us is despicable.
[57:13.600 --> 57:17.960]  And I want you to know, go ahead and try to roll it out now that it's a domestic group.
[57:17.960 --> 57:21.720]  Cuz they're doing the fallback now that it's foreigners and saying if they do catch these
[57:21.720 --> 57:24.920]  guys, they just wanna talk to them, yeah, and get them out of the country real quick.
[57:24.920 --> 57:26.360]  Yeah, you think that's gonna fly?
[57:26.360 --> 57:30.640]  I'll tell you this, it's not gonna fly blaming us, you understand that?
[57:30.640 --> 57:34.740]  I'm taking your tool, the American people are taking your tool of staging stuff in New
[57:34.740 --> 57:37.080]  Oklahoma cities and we're taking it away.
[57:37.080 --> 57:40.400]  And you got caught on Fast and Furious, didn't you?
[57:40.400 --> 57:43.400]  And yeah, that you were gonna blame the Second Amendment, that even came out.
[57:43.400 --> 57:48.460]  And you got caught on this, and you're gonna get caught on everything you do.
[57:48.460 --> 57:52.240]  You're gonna get caught everywhere and everything you do.
[57:52.240 --> 57:55.400]  Everybody should search the term false flag, we should make it the number one search term.
[57:55.400 --> 57:57.200]  Let's try to do the Google bomb again.
[57:57.200 --> 58:00.880]  Everybody go into the search term at Google and type in false flag and do it over and
[58:00.880 --> 58:01.880]  over again.
[58:01.880 --> 58:06.320]  All right, I said I'd get to the Badandi clip, it's up on infowars.com.
[58:06.320 --> 58:08.600]  We're gonna play it when we come back and start the next hour.
[58:08.600 --> 58:12.520]  And I'm gonna recap all the news and go through it and get into the fertilizer bombing, which
[58:12.520 --> 58:16.300]  may have been a real event, I just had a Freudian slip.
[58:16.300 --> 58:21.720]  The fertilizer explosion, which may have been a accident, may have really been just a fire
[58:21.720 --> 58:25.760]  that caused it and did all that, but sure came right on time.
[58:25.760 --> 58:30.740]  Like I said yesterday, watch them stage some more stuff to cover this up.
[58:30.740 --> 58:34.320]  They did Waco to cover up the World Trade Center, first attack when the feds made the
[58:34.320 --> 58:38.260]  bomb and trained the drivers and gave them the detonators and everything.
[58:38.260 --> 58:40.920]  That was done just a week after that to cover that news up.
[58:40.920 --> 58:44.040]  There's no telling how they're gonna strike back and we're gonna talk about that coming
[58:44.040 --> 58:45.040]  up.
[58:45.040 --> 58:46.040]  Stay with us.
[58:46.040 --> 58:57.720]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[58:57.720 --> 59:01.800]  In the last two years alone, the US has seen huge losses to our food supply.
[59:01.800 --> 59:07.520]  In 2011, storms and floods raged across the US, costing us 20 billion in lost crops alone.
[59:07.520 --> 59:11.580]  In 2012, we saw the largest drought in the country in more than 50 years.
[59:11.580 --> 59:15.480]  You may think out of sight, out of mind, and so you don't think you will be affected.
[59:15.480 --> 59:16.880]  The fact is you are.
[59:16.880 --> 59:18.040]  We all are.
[59:18.040 --> 59:20.560]  Food shortages drive prices up for everyone.
[59:20.560 --> 59:25.340]  You might not be able to control mother nature, but you can control your food prices by freezing
[59:25.340 --> 59:29.100]  the cost and availability of your food supply with eFoods Direct.
[59:29.100 --> 59:30.520]  Be prepared before you need it.
[59:30.520 --> 59:33.960]  With nutrient-dense food, you can store for up to 25 years.
[59:33.960 --> 59:36.360]  You can hope for the best, but hope won't feed you.

[01:00:00.800 --> 01:00:03.000]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:12.440]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:12.440 --> 01:00:17.280]  Big brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[01:00:17.280 --> 01:00:18.280]  You want answers?
[01:00:18.280 --> 01:00:20.400]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:20.400 --> 01:00:24.600]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:24.600 --> 01:00:29.640]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:29.640 --> 01:00:33.280]  Max Keiser pops in at the bottom of the hour to get into gold, the economy, Bitcoin, and
[01:00:33.280 --> 01:00:34.680]  more in his take on the bombings.
[01:00:34.680 --> 01:00:41.240]  I'm going to open the phones up in the third hour for all of you out there.
[01:00:41.240 --> 01:00:44.480]  They're trying to pass SOPA and CISPA right now.
[01:00:44.480 --> 01:00:48.280]  We did shoot down the gun-grabbing bill for now, showing the power of the people.
[01:00:48.280 --> 01:00:52.880]  Biden was doing fake crying or maybe doing real crying that their false flag's been exposed.
[01:00:52.880 --> 01:00:59.160]  In our article on Infowars.com, Obama covering up Saudi link to Boston bombing.
[01:00:59.160 --> 01:01:03.400]  I love the comment by Anonymous, who commented at 11 AM.
[01:01:03.400 --> 01:01:04.400]  Simple arithmetic.
[01:01:04.400 --> 01:01:05.560]  Guys, you can punch this up.
[01:01:05.560 --> 01:01:06.560]  Thank you.
[01:01:06.560 --> 01:01:07.560]  Simple arithmetic, my friends.
[01:01:07.560 --> 01:01:13.040]  One, orchestrate bombing on Patriots Day in city of original Boston Tea Party.
[01:01:13.040 --> 01:01:20.760]  Two, detonate bombs near the finish line at the end of the race, where slow Caucasians
[01:01:20.760 --> 01:01:26.760]  trudged forth and not earlier when the Olympic caliber, and it goes on.
[01:01:26.760 --> 01:01:28.320]  We're also about to finish line.
[01:01:28.320 --> 01:01:35.880]  We create major news distractions as banksters crash paper precious metal markets, as well
[01:01:35.880 --> 01:01:41.680]  as averting media attention from Benghazi investigation, as well as creating opportunity
[01:01:41.680 --> 01:01:46.960]  for eventual radical right-wing gun-toning, bobble-thumping, middle-aged white supremacists
[01:01:46.960 --> 01:01:51.800]  from Montana, fiction equal future.
[01:01:51.800 --> 01:01:58.240]  More street cameras, surveillance, more wimpy Americans begging for protection, institution
[01:01:58.240 --> 01:02:01.920]  of martial law first in Boston, which has now happened, globalist Bilderberg, America's
[01:02:01.920 --> 01:02:06.960]  begging for protection, institution of martial law first into Boston, and then into other
[01:02:06.960 --> 01:02:09.920]  major national metropolitan areas.
[01:02:09.920 --> 01:02:16.120]  D, communist fascist takeover of USA by new world order, with closet homosexual, closet
[01:02:16.120 --> 01:02:22.000]  Muslim sociopath, foreign plan Obama as point man dictator.
[01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:23.960]  And again, I don't read that to be mean to gay people or something.
[01:02:23.960 --> 01:02:25.080]  I actually hadn't read the full comment.
[01:02:25.080 --> 01:02:26.120]  I thought I would just read one.
[01:02:26.120 --> 01:02:27.120]  This is kind of silly.
[01:02:27.120 --> 01:02:33.120]  The Saudis, like 9-11, are more murdering weapons, while the victims are nothing more
[01:02:33.120 --> 01:02:38.120]  than sacrificial pawns, collateral damage for the greater Alinsky Marxist good, wake
[01:02:38.120 --> 01:02:41.800]  the bleep up and grow a set America.
[01:02:41.800 --> 01:02:46.000]  And remember, Obama sat at the feet of Bill Ayers, and they got smarter.
[01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:50.280]  Don't blow up people and then take credit and say, look, I scare you, do what I say.
[01:02:50.280 --> 01:02:53.880]  They found out with Hitler's bombing of London, that only makes people wanna fight harder.
[01:02:53.880 --> 01:02:55.560]  Blow stuff up and blame it on your enemies.
[01:02:55.560 --> 01:02:58.560]  I mean, that is the oldest trick in the book.
[01:02:58.560 --> 01:03:04.560]  And of course, you have to look at them as the culprits.
[01:03:04.560 --> 01:03:09.080]  Of course, you have to look at the establishment as the number one suspects first.
[01:03:09.080 --> 01:03:11.300]  You gotta look at everybody else too.
[01:03:11.300 --> 01:03:14.540]  And I said, I don't know who did this, but it stinks to eye heaven with all the build
[01:03:14.540 --> 01:03:17.280]  up demonizing patriots saying we're about to blow stuff up.
[01:03:17.280 --> 01:03:19.720]  They're trying to pass the gun bill.
[01:03:19.720 --> 01:03:21.640]  They wanna get this through.
[01:03:21.640 --> 01:03:23.920]  But it was so shoddily done.
[01:03:23.920 --> 01:03:26.560]  Plus, the Navy Seals aren't involved in this.
[01:03:26.560 --> 01:03:28.600]  The average FBI isn't involved in this.
[01:03:28.600 --> 01:03:29.920]  The Boston cops aren't involved.
[01:03:29.920 --> 01:03:33.960]  That's why you gotta have them out there in a drill with a bunch of black backpacks.
[01:03:33.960 --> 01:03:37.760]  Everyone's ordered to stand around in black backpacks and the Seals are all looking around
[01:03:37.760 --> 01:03:39.760]  like, why are we ordered to do this?
[01:03:39.760 --> 01:03:45.240]  So you can put in the redneck patsy and the Saudi patsies.
[01:03:45.240 --> 01:03:48.120]  And then if everything goes well, you blame the rednecks.
[01:03:48.120 --> 01:03:50.280]  But if things don't go well, you fall back on the Saudis.
[01:03:50.280 --> 01:03:55.480]  As I said Monday, I said they might come out and say rednecks working with Muslims.
[01:03:55.480 --> 01:04:00.480]  And I said that on record because they have the turbaned cowboy episodes on Family Guy
[01:04:00.480 --> 01:04:02.340]  and every other show is.
[01:04:02.340 --> 01:04:07.140]  And the training manuals and the preparations, remember the training manuals the army was
[01:04:07.140 --> 01:04:08.440]  given last month?
[01:04:08.440 --> 01:04:12.580]  The Christians are with Al-Qaeda, Catholics and evangelicals.
[01:04:12.580 --> 01:04:16.400]  And all these shows where the Tea Party works with Al-Qaeda, founding fathers, list goes
[01:04:16.400 --> 01:04:17.400]  on and on.
[01:04:17.400 --> 01:04:19.200]  You're like, that doesn't make any sense.
[01:04:19.200 --> 01:04:21.040]  They're getting ready for the branding.
[01:04:21.040 --> 01:04:22.680]  It's a major roll out.
[01:04:22.680 --> 01:04:29.680]  When you know this stuff, it is 100% obvious, 110% obvious.
[01:04:29.680 --> 01:04:34.560]  And I said, imminent, imminent, imminent mass shootings, mass bombings, blaming patriots,
[01:04:34.560 --> 01:04:36.840]  imminent, imminent, imminent, imminent.
[01:04:36.840 --> 01:04:46.480]  That day before it happened Monday on the show, I said, imminent attack, imminent.
[01:04:46.480 --> 01:04:49.880]  Because I could just see the crescendo and they couldn't help it.
[01:04:49.880 --> 01:04:53.400]  All the White House connected people, people talk, people brag, like something big is about
[01:04:53.400 --> 01:04:54.400]  to happen.
[01:04:54.400 --> 01:04:56.840]  You've seen all those things they put out saying, yeah, we need a new Oklahoma to blame
[01:04:56.840 --> 01:04:57.840]  on our enemies.
[01:04:57.840 --> 01:04:58.840]  Yeah, that would sure help.
[01:04:58.840 --> 01:04:59.840]  You know, Robert Shapiro.
[01:04:59.840 --> 01:05:00.840]  And they couldn't help it.
[01:05:00.840 --> 01:05:04.280]  MSNBC and all of them are like, there's about to be an attack and you're going to do it.
[01:05:04.280 --> 01:05:05.280]  Really?
[01:05:05.280 --> 01:05:06.280]  Really?
[01:05:06.280 --> 01:05:08.560]  We did it, huh?
[01:05:08.560 --> 01:05:13.240]  Now that we have moved into the winter season, there is an increased need to support our
[01:05:13.240 --> 01:05:15.280]  immunity and health.
[01:05:15.280 --> 01:05:19.900]  At Silver Lungs, we are committed to meeting your needs by providing a full selection of

[01:05:37.160 --> 01:05:41.800]  Our new silver gel is not based on synthetic gelling agents, which quickly evaporate and
[01:05:41.800 --> 01:05:43.720]  leave the silver at the surface.
[01:05:43.720 --> 01:05:48.600]  But rather, we have formulated our silver gel using the natural skin-nourishing chemistry
[01:05:48.600 --> 01:05:53.760]  of aloe vera to quickly penetrate and nourish the skin while delivering the silver more
[01:05:53.760 --> 01:05:55.320]  effectively.

[01:06:07.960 --> 01:06:12.440]  Devastating events like earthquakes, tornadoes, floods, hurricanes, or the threat of martial
[01:06:12.440 --> 01:06:16.520]  law have highlighted the need for Americans to prepare for emergencies.
[01:06:16.520 --> 01:06:20.280]  As a result, millions are stockpiling food, gold, and weapons.
[01:06:20.280 --> 01:06:25.500]  But how will these items help if you or one of your loved ones becomes ill?
[01:06:25.500 --> 01:06:30.500]  Supernatural silver is the ultimate tool to prepare you for a medical emergency.

[01:07:15.320 --> 01:07:16.720]  arsenal for home protection.
[01:07:16.720 --> 01:07:21.160]  When you're sleeping or away from home, who's watching out for intruders?

[01:08:12.640 --> 01:08:17.440]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[01:08:17.440 --> 01:08:18.440]  You want answers?
[01:08:18.440 --> 01:08:20.560]  Well, so does he.
[01:08:20.560 --> 01:08:24.800]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:24.800 --> 01:08:34.680]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:08:34.680 --> 01:08:45.720]  Alright, if you're just joining us, this is the most historic radio broadcast in 18 years
[01:08:45.720 --> 01:08:48.420]  I've ever done.
[01:08:48.420 --> 01:08:52.800]  We received from Anonymous, and we did Google searches on the photos that confirmed they
[01:08:52.800 --> 01:08:56.360]  were from Twitter accounts and news stations that didn't know what they had.
[01:08:56.360 --> 01:09:00.980]  We received from Anonymous contact, sent to Paul Watson.
[01:09:00.980 --> 01:09:03.520]  We are in contact with the folks that sent us the information.
[01:09:03.520 --> 01:09:05.960]  They've asked that we not mention what hacker group they're with.
[01:09:05.960 --> 01:09:09.720]  We'll just say they're anonymous, that they went out, and it's obviously intelligence
[01:09:09.720 --> 01:09:14.240]  people who don't like what's happening, that Navy SEALs were there at the event, at the
[01:09:14.240 --> 01:09:18.520]  finish line, all over the place with radiation detectors, black backpacks.
[01:09:18.520 --> 01:09:24.200]  We're talking 20 feet, max 20 yards, between 20 and 60 feet from the bombers, right there
[01:09:24.200 --> 01:09:26.720]  by the flags.
[01:09:26.720 --> 01:09:29.480]  There was a drill which they'd been caught lying about.
[01:09:29.480 --> 01:09:33.440]  They made them cancel their press conference and then say they hadn't caught the guy that
[01:09:33.440 --> 01:09:34.760]  did it.
[01:09:34.760 --> 01:09:36.840]  The media should be asking why they did that.
[01:09:36.840 --> 01:09:43.000]  Emergency meetings with the Saudi foreign minister last night with Obama.
[01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:44.880]  This is unprecedented cover-up.
[01:09:44.880 --> 01:09:49.760]  Now, what is on the videos and the photos up at infowars.com?
[01:09:49.760 --> 01:09:54.320]  In the articles Obama covering up Saudi link to bombing, person of interest to be deported
[01:09:54.320 --> 01:10:00.480]  after Obama had unscheduled meeting with Saudi foreign minister.
[01:10:00.480 --> 01:10:05.600]  There are rednecks that have matching black bags that look like the types that went off
[01:10:05.600 --> 01:10:08.960]  that we believe they were planning to go with as the patsies.
[01:10:08.960 --> 01:10:11.240]  We said then the Saudi Arabians would be ignored.
[01:10:11.240 --> 01:10:13.080]  You're like, well, that's just your speculation.
[01:10:13.080 --> 01:10:14.080]  No, it's not.
[01:10:14.080 --> 01:10:18.720]  The FBI and Janet Napolitano came up this morning and showed the exact photos we showed.
[01:10:18.720 --> 01:10:23.920]  A day later, ladies and gentlemen, saying here are people of interest.
[01:10:23.920 --> 01:10:25.800]  They're not suspects, but we want to talk to them.
[01:10:25.800 --> 01:10:27.680]  Yeah, they're with their black bags.
[01:10:27.680 --> 01:10:33.080]  You've got Navy SEALs everywhere wearing Navy SEAL hats, identifying which SEAL team they're
[01:10:33.080 --> 01:10:34.080]  with.
[01:10:34.080 --> 01:10:36.160]  No one had done the public is, they didn't know what that meant.
[01:10:36.160 --> 01:10:40.680]  In the tan boots, the tan pants, the black shirts, this broke yesterday at this time
[01:10:40.680 --> 01:10:42.800]  on air.
[01:10:42.800 --> 01:10:47.440]  You've got other people that look like they are kind of wearing the unofficial plain clothes
[01:10:47.440 --> 01:10:52.920]  uniform of Army special units, including above Army Delta.
[01:10:52.920 --> 01:10:55.080]  I've just covered this so much, I know what they look like.
[01:10:55.080 --> 01:11:00.400]  And they all kind of go with it when they want to be recognized by each other.
[01:11:00.400 --> 01:11:04.220]  It's not an undercover look so much as it's kind of an unofficial uniform.
[01:11:04.220 --> 01:11:08.440]  It looks like, show people the Delta Force guy, the one hiding in the doorway with the
[01:11:08.440 --> 01:11:13.780]  big backpack looking out incredibly suspiciously right there at the finish line, right behind
[01:11:13.780 --> 01:11:14.780]  the flags.
[01:11:14.780 --> 01:11:20.600]  I mean, it was just guys everywhere with black bags and loudspeakers saying, no one fear,
[01:11:20.600 --> 01:11:22.200]  it's only a drill, it's only a drill.
[01:11:22.200 --> 01:11:26.520]  And people just say, well, they were trying to stop the Saudi guys.
[01:11:26.520 --> 01:11:28.360]  Really, they could have just grabbed them right then then.
[01:11:28.360 --> 01:11:32.120]  I mean, anybody could walk up to suspicious people with big black backpacks.
[01:11:32.120 --> 01:11:34.080]  They let them get away.
[01:11:34.080 --> 01:11:37.820]  They were planning to blame the rednecks, ladies and gentlemen, and how do I know that?
[01:11:37.820 --> 01:11:42.040]  The Southern Poverty Law Center, White House run on record, came out a month ago and said,
[01:11:42.040 --> 01:11:46.000]  Mr. President, we only told Clinton this one month before the Oklahoma City bombing, cuz
[01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:48.800]  we're so smart, we're heroes.
[01:11:48.800 --> 01:11:53.120]  That this is the anti-gun, anti-America group that demonizes Ron Paul, myself, anybody that
[01:11:53.120 --> 01:11:56.040]  loves freedom, and basically says we're bad guys.
[01:11:56.040 --> 01:12:01.800]  They said, sir, the right wing, the Tea Party is gonna imminently engage in terror attacks.
[01:12:01.800 --> 01:12:03.240]  It's imminent, they're going to bomb.
[01:12:03.240 --> 01:12:04.960]  And I said, that's it.
[01:12:04.960 --> 01:12:07.200]  They ran Elohim City where McVeigh was at.
[01:12:07.200 --> 01:12:08.680]  It came out in federal documents.
[01:12:08.680 --> 01:12:11.280]  They were over that group.
[01:12:11.280 --> 01:12:13.560]  Carol Howe, all of it came out.
[01:12:13.560 --> 01:12:15.200]  They're deadly dangerous.
[01:12:15.200 --> 01:12:18.080]  They're the private government group.
[01:12:18.080 --> 01:12:19.880]  And I said, that's it, it's imminent.
[01:12:19.880 --> 01:12:22.880]  And then they started saying the last few weeks, the Tea Party's gonna shoot and blow
[01:12:22.880 --> 01:12:26.760]  things up, and told state police this all over the country, and said, prepare to take
[01:12:26.760 --> 01:12:28.000]  Christian's guns.
[01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:29.240]  Will you confiscate their guns?
[01:12:29.240 --> 01:12:32.080]  That's Fox News.
[01:12:32.080 --> 01:12:34.720]  And it started waking the police up going, what do you mean the Christians are gonna
[01:12:34.720 --> 01:12:35.720]  have an uprising?
[01:12:35.720 --> 01:12:37.760]  What are you talking about?
[01:12:37.760 --> 01:12:39.120]  Because they're gonna blame this on us.
[01:12:39.120 --> 01:12:42.920]  That's why I said it's imminent.
[01:12:42.920 --> 01:12:47.160]  I was able to tell you on air yesterday, it's on record, there's video and audio of it showing
[01:12:47.160 --> 01:12:51.200]  the Saudi Arabians saying those look like Saudi Arabians to me.
[01:12:51.200 --> 01:12:52.200]  And that's a cutout.
[01:12:52.200 --> 01:13:00.160]  People go, well, why would they have rednecks, and Saudis, and Navy SEALs, and police, and
[01:13:00.160 --> 01:13:06.400]  special army forces, probably Delta.
[01:13:06.400 --> 01:13:11.500]  Why would they have, well, that guy looks like Delta Force if I've ever seen one.
[01:13:11.500 --> 01:13:18.640]  Why would they, there's the Patsy, why would they have all of this going on at the same
[01:13:18.640 --> 01:13:19.640]  time?
[01:13:19.640 --> 01:13:22.600]  That way there's fallback plans, because they don't tell the SEALs what's happening.
[01:13:22.600 --> 01:13:25.720]  They say, you're part of a drill, come to this area.
[01:13:25.720 --> 01:13:27.920]  They tell the police, you're part of a drill, come to this area.
[01:13:27.920 --> 01:13:33.920]  So you got 20, 30, 40 guys with black backpacks show that no one knows who really bombed everything.
[01:13:33.920 --> 01:13:37.040]  That's a classic fog of war tactic they do.
[01:13:37.040 --> 01:13:39.400]  Oklahoma City, they had white supremacists.
[01:13:39.400 --> 01:13:41.540]  They had special forces, sheep dipped.
[01:13:41.540 --> 01:13:43.380]  They had German intelligence.
[01:13:43.380 --> 01:13:45.620]  They had Canadians there.
[01:13:45.620 --> 01:13:47.900]  They had CIA people there.
[01:13:47.900 --> 01:13:49.600]  They had ATF people there.
[01:13:49.600 --> 01:13:50.880]  They had FBI there.
[01:13:50.880 --> 01:13:55.200]  The FBI counter-terrorism director was there, got caught lying saying he wasn't.
[01:13:55.200 --> 01:13:56.200]  He was there the day before.
[01:13:56.200 --> 01:14:00.920]  That came out in court, all there one minute after the bombing.
[01:14:00.920 --> 01:14:05.480]  And cops that pulled up, Terrence Yakey, Don Browning, and others, head of the Canine Unit
[01:14:05.480 --> 01:14:06.480]  went, what are you doing?
[01:14:06.480 --> 01:14:07.720]  They're like, watch your mouth or we'll kill you.
[01:14:07.720 --> 01:14:09.200]  That's what we're doing.
[01:14:09.200 --> 01:14:11.800]  I mean, cops are smarter, like, what are you doing in bomb gear?
[01:14:11.800 --> 01:14:12.800]  That takes 20 minutes.
[01:14:12.800 --> 01:14:13.800]  What are you doing here?
[01:14:13.800 --> 01:14:15.180]  Would you, were you running a sting?
[01:14:15.180 --> 01:14:17.840]  You keep your mouth shut, boy.
[01:14:17.840 --> 01:14:19.520]  They ran a drill that morning.
[01:14:19.520 --> 01:14:22.560]  There were federal buildings worn the day before in that morning of a bombing.
[01:14:22.560 --> 01:14:24.400]  They even put a warning out.
[01:14:24.400 --> 01:14:27.200]  They go, man, our superiors warned us of this.
[01:14:27.200 --> 01:14:28.360]  They warned you.
[01:14:28.360 --> 01:14:33.300]  They planted the stink and plastic explosives inside, and a bunch of them didn't go off.
[01:14:33.300 --> 01:14:34.800]  And the rider truck was the diversion.
[01:14:34.800 --> 01:14:36.560]  See, I study these people.
[01:14:36.560 --> 01:14:42.360]  I'm risking my life to tell you this.
[01:14:42.360 --> 01:14:47.780]  They killed cops and medical examiners and medical people in Oklahoma City that tried
[01:14:47.780 --> 01:14:51.040]  to expose this.
[01:14:51.040 --> 01:14:53.880]  They killed a bunch of the first responders, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:14:53.880 --> 01:14:55.920]  But this isn't 1995.
[01:14:55.920 --> 01:14:58.820]  There are photos everywhere and you think we're so stupid.
[01:14:58.820 --> 01:15:02.000]  You're going to have everyone crawling all over the place.
[01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:07.820]  And then you're going to have your patsies who were probably told, hey, you're in trouble
[01:15:07.820 --> 01:15:11.400]  for this gun charge, Mr. Brown or whatever their name is.
[01:15:11.400 --> 01:15:14.720]  Go help us in drills and we'll drop the charges.
[01:15:14.720 --> 01:15:17.920]  That's how we've caught them doing that with Randy Weaver and others.
[01:15:17.920 --> 01:15:20.080]  They're like, all right, I want to serve my country.
[01:15:20.080 --> 01:15:21.080]  Good, good.
[01:15:21.080 --> 01:15:27.520]  Because they know the guys on welfare probably got a 75 IQ, low grade moron, mentally retarded
[01:15:27.520 --> 01:15:29.560]  mildly, but is able to keep a job.
[01:15:29.560 --> 01:15:33.760]  There's lots of working people that are actually retarded out there who come from families
[01:15:33.760 --> 01:15:34.760]  that make them work.
[01:15:34.760 --> 01:15:39.120]  I mean, the guy looks like he's got about a 75 max 80 IQ.
[01:15:39.120 --> 01:15:43.160]  And I said, okay, it'll be these Saudis, it'll be these guys, and they're going to have the
[01:15:43.160 --> 01:15:44.640]  fallback now.
[01:15:44.640 --> 01:15:48.040]  But I don't know how they can announce that they've arrested these guys because now everyone's
[01:15:48.040 --> 01:15:49.040]  going to point out these photos.
[01:15:49.040 --> 01:15:50.840]  And they're listening live time to the show.
[01:15:50.840 --> 01:15:56.280]  They flip out and then cancel the press conference.
[01:15:56.280 --> 01:16:01.120]  That's how immersed in this, ladies and gentlemen, I am, again, I told you yesterday, these Saudi
[01:16:01.120 --> 01:16:05.720]  Arabians, they're Saudi Arabians, now they're saying they think they're Saudi Arabians.
[01:16:05.720 --> 01:16:08.840]  They don't want you to know about this, but now they're going to be forced to show you
[01:16:08.840 --> 01:16:10.480]  these photos.
[01:16:10.480 --> 01:16:11.480]  Sure enough, they did.
[01:16:11.480 --> 01:16:13.880]  And again, how do I know what they were planning?
[01:16:13.880 --> 01:16:16.560]  This is the most important point.
[01:16:16.560 --> 01:16:21.780]  Because every outlet run by the White House from MSNBC to Media Matters to the Southern
[01:16:21.780 --> 01:16:25.000]  Poverty Law Center came out in the last month really cocky.
[01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:27.680]  It's not like they're brought into the meeting and told what's going to happen.
[01:16:27.680 --> 01:16:30.720]  They're just like, okay, the right wing's going to get exposed now.
[01:16:30.720 --> 01:16:32.080]  Talk about how they're going to stage terror.
[01:16:32.080 --> 01:16:36.940]  It's in every show, every TV, Hollywood's gotten the memo from Family Guy to Founding
[01:16:36.940 --> 01:16:40.900]  Fathers to the following to medical shows.
[01:16:40.900 --> 01:16:42.560]  The Patriots are going to bomb you.
[01:16:42.560 --> 01:16:44.920]  They're going to shoot you.
[01:16:44.920 --> 01:16:47.920]  They're going to blow up your sporting event because they believe in George Washington.
[01:16:47.920 --> 01:16:53.720]  I mean, it's obvious, the whole scripting targeting the dumb public, the dumb down public.
[01:16:53.720 --> 01:16:58.680]  And boom, it happens and I see these photos, Anonymous was right to send them to us.
[01:16:58.680 --> 01:17:01.320]  We hammer them out there and they still haven't shown all the others.
[01:17:01.320 --> 01:17:05.800]  They are freaking out right now.
[01:17:05.800 --> 01:17:11.200]  AbsoluteDrudgeReport.com is the only major media outlet that has picked this up.
[01:17:11.200 --> 01:17:16.160]  The only major media outlet that has picked this up is the DrudgeReport.com left hand
[01:17:16.160 --> 01:17:22.160]  side has our article and link to our article about the photos rocking the internet last
[01:17:22.160 --> 01:17:23.240]  night and this morning.
[01:17:23.240 --> 01:17:28.840]  The photos that we posted at Infowars.com that are linked in Paul's new article Obama
[01:17:28.840 --> 01:17:33.440]  covering up Saudi link to Boston bombing, which then forced the blaze to finally report
[01:17:33.440 --> 01:17:35.040]  on all this, which is our plan.
[01:17:35.040 --> 01:17:37.520]  See, we're not trying to scoop you, Glenn.
[01:17:37.520 --> 01:17:39.140]  We want to make you cover the truth.
[01:17:39.140 --> 01:17:40.700]  Why don't you apologize to me?
[01:17:40.700 --> 01:17:43.600]  You spent 30 minutes attacking me yesterday saying I was making this up.
[01:17:43.600 --> 01:17:46.760]  It's not about two talk shows fighting with each other.
[01:17:46.760 --> 01:17:51.240]  Just admit you take your information from my show and then twist it for your own uses
[01:17:51.240 --> 01:17:52.720]  and I'm sick of it.
[01:17:52.720 --> 01:17:57.360]  You're not gonna bury this information.
[01:17:57.360 --> 01:18:01.360]  We could bring down this entire operation, but he's too scared to do it.
[01:18:01.360 --> 01:18:05.560]  If we could get Limbaugh and if we could get Glenn Beck and Sean Hannity to talk about
[01:18:05.560 --> 01:18:08.180]  this, it is over for these people.
[01:18:08.180 --> 01:18:09.180]  It is over.
[01:18:09.180 --> 01:18:11.360]  And by the way, this is dangerous.
[01:18:11.360 --> 01:18:15.800]  By the way, there's no telling what the globalist may stage now to bring in tyranny.
[01:18:15.800 --> 01:18:18.640]  I want to go out to break with Dan Badandi at the press conference part of it will come
[01:18:18.640 --> 01:18:21.120]  back with more the night of the event.
[01:18:21.120 --> 01:18:24.580]  And instantly when he brings up false flag, they turn and get freaked out when they talk
[01:18:24.580 --> 01:18:27.360]  about the drill acting guilty as sin.
[01:18:27.360 --> 01:18:28.920]  That was another big telltale sign.
[01:18:28.920 --> 01:18:34.560]  I went from maybe a false flag to 99% it is and the evidence just piles and piles.
[01:18:34.560 --> 01:18:35.560]  Let's go to that clip.
[01:18:35.560 --> 01:18:40.240]  Is there any security footage of any of these explosions?
[01:18:40.240 --> 01:18:42.040]  We are looking at all of that right now.
[01:18:42.040 --> 01:18:44.360]  That's one of the investigative steps that we have taken.
[01:18:44.360 --> 01:18:48.200]  Was there any point in the outro because according to Boston Globe dot com, they said they were
[01:18:48.200 --> 01:18:51.520]  doing drills this morning for the same exact thing that happened according to Boston Globe
[01:18:51.520 --> 01:18:52.520]  dot com.
[01:18:52.520 --> 01:18:55.800]  Now, would you guys given any warning ahead of time of this taking place?
[01:18:55.800 --> 01:18:58.880]  As I said earlier, there was no specific intelligence.
[01:18:58.880 --> 01:19:02.520]  We certainly increased our posture around a big event like this.
[01:19:02.520 --> 01:19:06.120]  All of those things happened in preparation for this event, but there was no specific
[01:19:06.120 --> 01:19:07.840]  intelligence that anything was going to happen.
[01:19:07.840 --> 01:19:10.600]  And can you talk a little bit about what type of device do you have?
[01:19:10.600 --> 01:19:16.440]  The city of Boston is open and will be open tomorrow, but it will not be business as usual.
[01:19:16.440 --> 01:19:22.280]  It will be a heightened law enforcement presence consistent with the severity and seriousness
[01:19:22.280 --> 01:19:23.280]  of the ongoing investigation.
[01:19:23.280 --> 01:19:29.920]  People should expect those who are riding the T that there will be command checks of
[01:19:29.920 --> 01:19:33.040]  backpacks and other parcels.
[01:19:33.040 --> 01:19:34.960]  And we just we're going to come back with the rest.
[01:19:34.960 --> 01:19:39.520]  If people ask what the goal is, distract the wartime indictment by the Congressional Committee
[01:19:39.520 --> 01:19:46.500]  of Obama and Bush Jr. for torture and ordering it and then ordering a cover up, cover up
[01:19:46.500 --> 01:19:51.880]  for Benghazi, cover up to get the gun stuff passed, cover up on the economy and a way
[01:19:51.880 --> 01:19:56.880]  to roll out martial law, which they were already doing with troops on the streets, checking
[01:19:56.880 --> 01:19:59.600]  your junk for Al Qaeda bombs.
[01:19:59.600 --> 01:20:02.840]  We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen, with the rest of this key audio Max Keiser
[01:20:02.840 --> 01:20:03.840]  coming up.
[01:20:03.840 --> 01:20:08.120]  But we have caught them stay with us.

[01:22:38.320 --> 01:22:42.120]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stock workers, investment advisors won't talk about gold

[01:22:43.120 --> 01:22:47.120]  They've been available since 1986 yet the financial industry won't recognize the value
[01:22:47.120 --> 01:22:48.820]  of gold for your retirement.
[01:22:48.820 --> 01:22:52.280]  Gold has outperformed paper investments yet no word about IRAs.
[01:22:52.280 --> 01:22:57.280]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement call 800-686-2237.

[01:23:10.920 --> 01:23:11.920]  Box.
[01:23:11.920 --> 01:23:14.860]  I want you to know some very important information.
[01:23:14.860 --> 01:23:19.680]  In 1985 President Ronald Reagan requested that Carnivora be sent directly to the White
[01:23:19.680 --> 01:23:24.020]  House at a time when only the President could obtain this world-class healer.
[01:23:24.020 --> 01:23:29.580]  Now 27 years later Carnivora capsules are used around the world to keep people healthy.
[01:23:29.580 --> 01:23:34.640]  Now you can protect yourself and your loved ones in this age of superbugs with 17 naturally
[01:23:34.640 --> 01:23:39.800]  occurring compounds that instinctively respond to abnormal cells only without harming a single
[01:23:39.800 --> 01:23:40.920]  normal cell.
[01:23:40.920 --> 01:23:44.600]  If you want to stay healthy now's your chance to literally wake up your critical immune
[01:23:44.600 --> 01:23:48.680]  cells to attack harmful invaders that don't belong in your body.
[01:23:48.680 --> 01:23:56.600]  Call 1-866-VenusFly or order from Carnivora.com that's C-A-R-N-I-V-O-R-A dot com.
[01:23:56.600 --> 01:24:04.000]  That's 1-866-836-8735 1-866-VenusFly or visit Carnivora.com.

[01:24:05.000 --> 01:24:06.000]  It's the only one you've got.
[01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:28.120]  Well, Infowars.com broke internationally in the news and the Drudge Report broke it
[01:24:28.120 --> 01:24:31.120]  even bigger.
[01:24:31.120 --> 01:24:36.200]  The photos of the people from Saudi Arabia, they believe, who are the main suspects in
[01:24:36.200 --> 01:24:43.440]  the bombing and they have canceled press conferences and had said they'd arrested who they thought
[01:24:43.440 --> 01:24:44.440]  did it.
[01:24:44.440 --> 01:24:48.720]  And now that's all supposed to be forgot and no media will cover it and it's supposedly
[01:24:48.720 --> 01:24:50.800]  nothing's happened here.
[01:24:50.800 --> 01:24:54.280]  Now ladies and gentlemen, if a small town TV station broke who the guys were and found
[01:24:54.280 --> 01:24:56.000]  the photos, it'd be all over the news.
[01:24:56.000 --> 01:25:01.000]  They don't want everybody coming to Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:05.080]  So we have to have our writers write articles explaining what just happened.
[01:25:05.080 --> 01:25:08.560]  Do you understand how big this is?
[01:25:08.560 --> 01:25:12.720]  They have been caught running a drill that witnesses saw and heard saying, don't worry.
[01:25:12.720 --> 01:25:13.720]  Don't worry about the backpacks.
[01:25:13.720 --> 01:25:15.440]  It's just a drill.
[01:25:15.440 --> 01:25:19.440]  As the cops and military stand around with their own backpacks, their own black backpacks,
[01:25:19.440 --> 01:25:24.640]  while Saudis and some white hillbilly types are there as the patsies.
[01:25:24.640 --> 01:25:28.760]  And the media was getting ready yesterday before this came out and going, yeah, it looks
[01:25:28.760 --> 01:25:33.600]  like it's lone wolf, and MSNBC, everybody's like, yeah, it's about to be the tea party
[01:25:33.600 --> 01:25:34.880]  like we told you.
[01:25:34.880 --> 01:25:39.520]  The arrest has been made, gonna have a press conference at the courthouse.
[01:25:39.520 --> 01:25:41.640]  Then they went, forget that.
[01:25:41.640 --> 01:25:42.640]  We don't have anybody.
[01:25:42.640 --> 01:25:43.640]  There's no press conference.
[01:25:43.640 --> 01:25:44.760]  We gotta meet with the Saudis.
[01:25:44.760 --> 01:25:53.200]  I mean unraveling in front of everyone and false flags, one of the top search terms.
[01:25:53.200 --> 01:25:55.800]  And they're just hoping they can get away with this.
[01:25:55.800 --> 01:25:57.460]  Imagine the magnitude.
[01:25:57.460 --> 01:26:03.440]  This shows you how controlled the media is, that only infowars.com and drudgereport.com
[01:26:03.440 --> 01:26:04.860]  are covering this.
[01:26:04.860 --> 01:26:09.840]  And the photos we released are the photos they were forced to then put out, the very
[01:26:09.840 --> 01:26:12.440]  photos a day later.
[01:26:12.440 --> 01:26:17.080]  But they won't say, the media stands around to wait till the government gives them a photo
[01:26:17.080 --> 01:26:19.280]  and ignores, hey, who was right?
[01:26:19.280 --> 01:26:26.880]  Not well, good job, infowars.com, Paul Watson, Alex Jones, Matt Drudge, Matt Drudge's crew.
[01:26:26.880 --> 01:26:31.600]  I mean, it'd be like Drudge breaking Monica Lewinsky again and them not saying Drudge
[01:26:31.600 --> 01:26:35.720]  broke it.
[01:26:35.720 --> 01:26:40.920]  But this is the government, or the criminal elements of it, creating their standard drill
[01:26:40.920 --> 01:26:46.480]  where you got a bunch of decoys and they use Navy Seals and what looks like Army Special
[01:26:46.480 --> 01:26:47.480]  Forces.
[01:26:47.480 --> 01:26:51.140]  I've been to so many of these events, I've learned how the Army dresses in there.
[01:26:51.140 --> 01:26:55.780]  It's a uniform, but it's not, the public's so disconnected, it's not obvious the guys
[01:26:55.780 --> 01:26:59.320]  are wearing uniforms, they really are.
[01:26:59.320 --> 01:27:04.960]  It's Navy Seal insignias, all of it, that's how dumb they think you are.
[01:27:04.960 --> 01:27:08.720]  And we're sitting here, this is the story, they've lied about the drill, they've lied
[01:27:08.720 --> 01:27:14.600]  about it all to my reporter that was all over national news, that didn't make the news?
[01:27:14.600 --> 01:27:19.280]  Or they said, Alex, the mega troll Jones and his troll heckled, really?
[01:27:19.280 --> 01:27:23.120]  Hey, there's a drill, eyewitnesses, what about the drill?
[01:27:23.120 --> 01:27:30.000]  There was no drill and there was no prior knowledge, liars, liars, liars, this is so
[01:27:30.000 --> 01:27:31.000]  big.
[01:27:31.000 --> 01:27:36.000]  Let's go back to Damodandi Monday night, info wars.com reporter, and again, I don't even
[01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:37.960]  want to credit for this.
[01:27:37.960 --> 01:27:42.300]  I want the media to start focusing on, look at these other photos, look, that's right
[01:27:42.300 --> 01:27:45.240]  by the flagpoles, that's right by the bomb.
[01:27:45.240 --> 01:27:48.640]  Cops with big black backpacks looking right at the other guys.
[01:27:48.640 --> 01:27:53.000]  I mean, the cops were searching everybody there, why didn't you search the rednecks?
[01:27:53.000 --> 01:27:54.560]  Why didn't you search the Saudis?
[01:27:54.560 --> 01:27:58.000]  Why don't you want these photos out if you're not involved?
[01:27:58.000 --> 01:27:59.800]  This is hiding in plain view.
[01:27:59.800 --> 01:28:00.800]  Let's go back to the clip of Damodandi.
[01:28:00.800 --> 01:28:05.800]  The city of Boston is open and will be open tomorrow, but it will not be business as usual.
[01:28:05.800 --> 01:28:06.800]  That's the governor.
[01:28:06.800 --> 01:28:07.800]  They're gonna have troops searching, everybody, yeah.
[01:28:07.800 --> 01:28:08.800]  They're hiding in law enforcement presence consistent with the severity and seriousness
[01:28:08.800 --> 01:28:09.800]  of the ongoing investigation.
[01:28:09.800 --> 01:28:20.800]  People should expect, those who are riding the T, that there will be random checks of
[01:28:20.800 --> 01:28:27.000]  the backpacks and other parcels, and we just ask everyone to be patient with that inconvenience
[01:28:27.000 --> 01:28:28.480]  for the time being.
[01:28:28.480 --> 01:28:31.120]  It is for the public's safety.
[01:28:31.120 --> 01:28:36.160]  Here in the state, at the local level and at the federal level, we are all coming together
[01:28:36.160 --> 01:28:40.160]  to do everything we can to get to the bottom of this.
[01:28:40.160 --> 01:28:43.920]  The most important fact that I want to convey to everybody this evening has already been
[01:28:43.920 --> 01:28:49.360]  mentioned by Governor Patrick, the FBI is taking the lead in this investigation, it
[01:28:49.360 --> 01:28:53.520]  is a certain federal jurisdiction, it will do so through the Boston Joint Terrorism Task
[01:28:53.520 --> 01:28:58.240]  Force, members of which are comprised by all the members of the law enforcement agencies
[01:28:58.240 --> 01:29:00.120]  here represented at the podium.
[01:29:00.120 --> 01:29:05.640]  This will be a combined federal, state, and local effort, it will be an ongoing investigation,
[01:29:05.640 --> 01:29:11.120]  it is a criminal investigation that is, has the potential, that is a potential terrorist
[01:29:11.120 --> 01:29:12.120]  investigation.
[01:29:12.120 --> 01:29:13.520]  If you take any questions.
[01:29:13.520 --> 01:29:18.000]  Oh, sir, why were a lot of speakers telling people in the audience to be calm moments
[01:29:18.000 --> 01:29:21.920]  before the bomb went off, is this another false flag staged attack to take on several
[01:29:21.920 --> 01:29:25.160]  liberties and put more homeland security on sticking their hands down on the pants on
[01:29:25.160 --> 01:29:26.160]  the streets.
[01:29:26.160 --> 01:29:27.160]  No.
[01:29:27.160 --> 01:29:28.160]  Next question.
[01:29:28.160 --> 01:29:29.320]  You have said that there's no suspect but is there a false flag?
[01:29:29.320 --> 01:29:32.560]  I'm not going to confirm that right now, we'll have that information for you first thing
[01:29:32.560 --> 01:29:35.280]  in the morning, medical people are compiling that as we speak.
[01:29:35.280 --> 01:29:39.360]  Again, why were speakers telling people to be, to characterize the fact of terrorism?
[01:29:39.360 --> 01:29:42.480]  Extent of the injuries and how serious people are.
[01:29:42.480 --> 01:29:46.100]  We're going to come back with the rest of this and then Max Keiser, but he says at the
[01:29:46.100 --> 01:29:50.200]  time, this is a false flag, gentlemen, ladies and gentlemen, this is a false flag.
[01:29:50.200 --> 01:29:51.520]  We don't know exactly who did it.
[01:29:51.520 --> 01:29:55.460]  We know the government was running it and is now covering it up in plain view.
[01:29:55.460 --> 01:29:57.360]  This thing is fully blown wide open.
[01:29:57.360 --> 01:29:58.640]  We're on the march.
[01:29:58.640 --> 01:29:59.640]  The Empire.
[01:29:59.640 --> 01:30:01.080]  This is history happening, folks.
[01:30:01.080 --> 01:30:04.320]  Alex Jones and we can't probably defeat them with this.
[01:30:04.320 --> 01:30:07.920]  This could destroy them.
[01:30:07.920 --> 01:30:13.420]  In the last two years alone, the US has seen huge losses to our food supply in 2011 storms
[01:30:13.420 --> 01:30:17.560]  and floods raged across the US costing us 20 billion in lost crops alone.
[01:30:17.560 --> 01:30:21.800]  In 2012, we saw the largest drought in the country in more than 50 years.
[01:30:21.800 --> 01:30:25.680]  You may think out of sight, out of mind, and so you don't think you will be affected.
[01:30:25.680 --> 01:30:28.240]  The fact is you are, we all are.
[01:30:28.240 --> 01:30:30.760]  Food shortages drive prices up for everyone.
[01:30:30.760 --> 01:30:35.560]  You might not be able to control mother nature, but you can control your food prices by freezing
[01:30:35.560 --> 01:30:39.320]  the cost and availability of your food supply with E Foods Direct.
[01:30:39.320 --> 01:30:40.740]  Be prepared before you need it.
[01:30:40.740 --> 01:30:44.160]  With nutrient-dense food you can store for up to 25 years.
[01:30:44.160 --> 01:30:46.520]  You can hope for the best, but hope won't feed you.
[01:30:46.520 --> 01:30:50.200]  Do what I've done and get your own supply of the best durable foods out there from E

[01:31:47.840 --> 01:31:48.840]  needs.

[01:32:07.860 --> 01:32:12.340]  Devastating events like earthquakes, tornadoes, floods, hurricanes or the threat of martial
[01:32:12.340 --> 01:32:16.400]  law have highlighted the need for Americans to prepare for emergencies.
[01:32:16.400 --> 01:32:20.160]  As a result, millions are stockpiling food, gold and weapons.
[01:32:20.160 --> 01:32:24.480]  But how will these items help if you or one of your loved ones becomes ill?
[01:32:24.480 --> 01:32:29.480]  Supernatural Silver is the ultimate tool to prepare you for a medical emergency.

[01:33:19.400 --> 01:33:24.800]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:24.800 --> 01:33:34.680]  All right, Max Keiser was going to be on with us, but his Skype's not working and we're
[01:33:34.680 --> 01:33:37.360]  seeing we get him on cell phone.
[01:33:37.360 --> 01:33:40.400]  But regardless, I'm going to be covering the news here.
[01:33:40.400 --> 01:33:41.680]  I want you to understand something.
[01:33:41.680 --> 01:33:46.880]  I tend to get up here when we have ultra massive news and kind of calmly report it.
[01:33:46.880 --> 01:33:50.200]  More to be more accurate, I'm just excited all the time.
[01:33:50.200 --> 01:33:52.240]  But this is over the top.
[01:33:52.240 --> 01:33:57.760]  I mean, this is so incredible that in the 21st century, you have the real birth of the
[01:33:57.760 --> 01:34:03.960]  citizen media where everybody is out there by the millions, seeing the Navy SEALs, seeing
[01:34:03.960 --> 01:34:04.960]  the handlers.
[01:34:04.960 --> 01:34:09.360]  There's new photos that looks like cops handling the patsies, bringing them in.
[01:34:09.360 --> 01:34:14.560]  Obviously, these goofy looking guys with backpacks, the cops will be all over them.
[01:34:14.560 --> 01:34:17.080]  That's why they're telling people, be calm, this is just a drill.
[01:34:17.080 --> 01:34:19.500]  Never mind the weirdos with big black backpacks.
[01:34:19.500 --> 01:34:21.560]  Never mind people leaving them right there.
[01:34:21.560 --> 01:34:22.560]  Just a drill.
[01:34:22.560 --> 01:34:27.520]  Now, cops, we're told to get back just for our safety though.
[01:34:27.520 --> 01:34:30.720]  And the cops get back and it blows up.
[01:34:30.720 --> 01:34:34.180]  I mean, folks, now people know what they're looking for.
[01:34:34.180 --> 01:34:36.060]  And the system, of course, knew the whole time.
[01:34:36.060 --> 01:34:37.440]  It's full of Navy SEALs.
[01:34:37.440 --> 01:34:38.720]  It's full of Army.
[01:34:38.720 --> 01:34:42.480]  It's full of undercover police everywhere with big black backpacks.
[01:34:42.480 --> 01:34:45.760]  And then you see after the bombs go off, they're directing things.
[01:34:45.760 --> 01:34:51.660]  In fact, I never have a tightness in my throat and kind of an anxiety.
[01:34:51.660 --> 01:34:55.080]  I haven't had anxiety like that since I was like 14, getting a date with the best looking
[01:34:55.080 --> 01:34:56.080]  cheerleader.
[01:34:56.080 --> 01:35:00.000]  And you're going to the movies where they're getting dropped off by our parents.
[01:35:00.000 --> 01:35:03.560]  You kind of get that tightness in your throat before you reach over and kiss her.
[01:35:03.560 --> 01:35:05.720]  I'm having butterflies, okay?
[01:35:05.720 --> 01:35:09.920]  And I'm somebody that's spoken to crowds of 5,000 people and I don't get butterflies.
[01:35:09.920 --> 01:35:14.600]  I go on The View and I don't get butterflies talking to 20 million people.
[01:35:14.600 --> 01:35:19.160]  Right now, I'm having so many butterflies that I'm actually hyperventilating on air,
[01:35:19.160 --> 01:35:20.160]  okay?
[01:35:20.160 --> 01:35:24.360]  I mean, that's how big this is.
[01:35:24.360 --> 01:35:32.920]  Because this is like catching people, again, burying the dead bodies on film in the backyard.
[01:35:32.920 --> 01:35:35.640]  This is open and shut smoking gun.
[01:35:35.640 --> 01:35:38.840]  You call in all these people, you ask who ordered them to do what, you'll find out who
[01:35:38.840 --> 01:35:42.760]  was in charge, you'll find out who was handling who, you'll find out who did this and who
[01:35:42.760 --> 01:35:44.040]  blew up the marathon.
[01:35:44.040 --> 01:35:52.820]  I mean, we're sitting here, this will destroy the globalist if this comes out.
[01:35:52.820 --> 01:35:59.040]  And you notice no media is going, wow, Alex Jones of all people got the photos of who
[01:35:59.040 --> 01:36:01.320]  they say they're looking for now.
[01:36:01.320 --> 01:36:08.200]  Why didn't the media over several days, and you think I'm so busy, you think I'd be looking
[01:36:08.200 --> 01:36:09.880]  at this stuff close.
[01:36:09.880 --> 01:36:15.240]  And it was all hiding in plain view in front of everyone.
[01:36:15.240 --> 01:36:18.080]  Dude just came in here during the break is why I'm hyperventilating with a stack of new
[01:36:18.080 --> 01:36:24.480]  high def photos and stills out of the city of Boston surveillance footage.
[01:36:24.480 --> 01:36:30.000]  And it shows the handlers of the Saudis, and you can see the body language, all of it.
[01:36:30.000 --> 01:36:36.080]  And again, people say, you're just speculating, I told you they would be forced to release
[01:36:36.080 --> 01:36:44.440]  for the Saudis, I told you the Navy SEAL stuff, that's now all over the place.
[01:36:44.440 --> 01:36:50.360]  Let's finish up with Badandi, but first I wanna show this image here for everybody.
[01:36:50.360 --> 01:36:56.240]  There's an article up at infowars.com titled Papers, Please in Boston.
[01:36:56.240 --> 01:37:02.840]  And it shows 1938 Germany with young soldiers, two of them together going through people's
[01:37:02.840 --> 01:37:08.960]  papers and then it shows Boston, USA 2013 with two young MPs.
[01:37:08.960 --> 01:37:14.160]  I mean, they look like they know where they can be 20, with satisfied power trip looks,
[01:37:14.160 --> 01:37:17.600]  searching a businessman and checking his papers.
[01:37:17.600 --> 01:37:22.520]  Let me tell you something MPs, you're not searching anything, okay?
[01:37:22.520 --> 01:37:23.920]  Your bosses killed those people.
[01:37:23.920 --> 01:37:29.420]  Let me get that through your brain there, son, son, this is America and I'm sick of
[01:37:29.420 --> 01:37:36.040]  your garbage and I'm sick of the TSA and I'm sick all of it while the border is wide open.
[01:37:36.040 --> 01:37:41.600]  It's called a gambit boys, you say your soldiers, let me teach you, being a soldier means you
[01:37:41.600 --> 01:37:43.560]  know history and you know the enemy.
[01:37:43.560 --> 01:37:48.840]  The Iranians of today are the Persians of 4,000 years ago.
[01:37:48.840 --> 01:37:54.440]  And they developed in chess from a military move with horsemen called a gambit.
[01:37:54.440 --> 01:38:00.240]  A gambit is with your, and it's what most chess masters use a lot of times, sacrificing
[01:38:00.240 --> 01:38:03.480]  players to suck you in and defeat you.
[01:38:03.480 --> 01:38:10.840]  And a gambit is a pawn or a chess move mirroring cavalry, where you put cavalry in where they
[01:38:10.840 --> 01:38:16.820]  will be enveloped and destroyed because the enemy can't help going out and destroying
[01:38:16.820 --> 01:38:17.960]  a force.
[01:38:17.960 --> 01:38:23.320]  Let's say you got a pincer attack ready, you wanna see the main military force revealed
[01:38:23.320 --> 01:38:26.080]  from behind the hill, didn't have satellite back then.
[01:38:26.080 --> 01:38:33.400]  Believe me kids, they didn't 3,000 plus years ago, you send them out and the gambit works
[01:38:33.400 --> 01:38:34.400]  this way.
[01:38:34.400 --> 01:38:38.560]  And there's different types of gambits, but it's a basic horse move as the Iranians did
[01:38:38.560 --> 01:38:39.560]  it.
[01:38:39.560 --> 01:38:43.320]  You send them out, it calls out the main force, they unify, now you have a chance to launch
[01:38:43.320 --> 01:38:47.800]  a pincer on them because they've unified coming in to destroy the force.
[01:38:47.800 --> 01:38:51.120]  Or you've tricked them to come down off the hills they're on to destroy your force to
[01:38:51.120 --> 01:38:53.400]  get them in low ground so you can now attack.
[01:38:53.400 --> 01:38:56.640]  And it's also an Alexander the Great move that he used a lot.
[01:38:56.640 --> 01:39:02.520]  It's just basic gambit, Iranian term, Persian term.
[01:39:02.520 --> 01:39:08.200]  So in standard warfare, go back to World War I, they would send in a unit or several units,
[01:39:08.200 --> 01:39:14.080]  hundreds of men, sometimes whole plutons to be wiped out into a trench area that was disputed
[01:39:14.080 --> 01:39:15.560]  knowing they'd all be killed.
[01:39:15.560 --> 01:39:18.760]  And they would order them on what they called suicide missions.
[01:39:18.760 --> 01:39:21.160]  You've heard of suicide missions?
[01:39:21.160 --> 01:39:25.100]  This is how these generals like Lemonser were ready to bomb US movie theaters to blame it
[01:39:25.100 --> 01:39:27.600]  on Cuba and kill Americans.
[01:39:27.600 --> 01:39:34.880]  Ward, Cleaver, and Leave It to Beaver, Wally, that's what 1950s were.
[01:39:34.880 --> 01:39:39.400]  Blow up Wally at the movie, plastic explosives to blame it on the commies.
[01:39:39.400 --> 01:39:41.680]  And they said it's a gambit.
[01:39:41.680 --> 01:39:44.520]  We may even lose 10 million Americans, but we'll defeat communism.
[01:39:44.520 --> 01:39:49.120]  They were ready to lose 10 million Americans in the Russian counter strike.
[01:39:49.120 --> 01:39:50.880]  Dr. Strangelove's actually based on True Story.
[01:39:50.880 --> 01:39:51.880]  You see that movie?
[01:39:51.880 --> 01:39:57.040]  It's based on Curtis LeMay and LL Lemonser who plays the part of Jack T Ripper and all
[01:39:57.040 --> 01:39:58.040]  of it.
[01:39:58.040 --> 01:40:00.360]  Now that Stanley Kubrick movie, that's real folks.
[01:40:00.360 --> 01:40:04.800]  That almost happened in 1961.
[01:40:04.800 --> 01:40:06.800]  Film came out two years later.
[01:40:06.800 --> 01:40:11.960]  I'm giving you history here and a gambit is to sacrifice maybe 20, 30, 100 horsemen to
[01:40:11.960 --> 01:40:12.960]  draw out the enemy.
[01:40:12.960 --> 01:40:17.680]  And the argument is you save thousands of your cavalry and win the battle.
[01:40:17.680 --> 01:40:20.600]  So in military, it's called a sacrifice.
[01:40:20.600 --> 01:40:23.020]  And that's what they did.
[01:40:23.020 --> 01:40:29.360]  And they generally will use a foreign intelligence unit to actually do the bombing, like the
[01:40:29.360 --> 01:40:33.140]  Saudis who they used on 9-11 to then take the blame.
[01:40:33.140 --> 01:40:34.780]  Those Saudis were trained in US bases.
[01:40:34.780 --> 01:40:39.160]  That came out in mainstream news.
[01:40:39.160 --> 01:40:41.920]  So this is the information we're talking about.
[01:40:41.920 --> 01:40:46.400]  Here it is, gambit, a opening chess move in which a player risk one or more pawns or a
[01:40:46.400 --> 01:40:50.080]  minor piece to gain an advantage in position.
[01:40:50.080 --> 01:40:55.800]  A remark intended to start a conversation or make a telling point, a calculated move.
[01:40:55.800 --> 01:41:00.240]  There you go.
[01:41:00.240 --> 01:41:03.280]  And I'm not gonna sit here and rant and rave about this anymore.
[01:41:03.280 --> 01:41:05.920]  The point is they had a drill.
[01:41:05.920 --> 01:41:08.540]  They were all around the guys with the bombs.
[01:41:08.540 --> 01:41:11.080]  There's video and photos of it all.
[01:41:11.080 --> 01:41:16.160]  There's video of undercover police, it looks like, leading the mentally ill.
[01:41:16.160 --> 01:41:18.600]  That's what the guy looks like to me, body language, all of it.
[01:41:18.600 --> 01:41:22.600]  Leading up the poor patsy, who probably thought he was a secret agent now.
[01:41:22.600 --> 01:41:26.200]  He looks so proud to be on Team America.
[01:41:26.200 --> 01:41:30.860]  He doesn't know he's gonna be drugged up and rolled out as the new McVeigh.
[01:41:30.860 --> 01:41:37.400]  And gonna be electro-shocked, tortured, drugged up for trial, just like all the other patsies.
[01:41:37.400 --> 01:41:38.880]  It's so horrible.
[01:41:38.880 --> 01:41:42.260]  And you know what, the operation was blown for you.
[01:41:42.260 --> 01:41:43.260]  This is unprecedented.
[01:41:43.260 --> 01:41:48.760]  So now they're gonna say, maybe it's Saudis, we sent them back to Saudi Arabia, never mind.
[01:41:48.760 --> 01:41:51.120]  We met with the Saudi foreign minister emergency meeting.
[01:41:51.120 --> 01:41:55.760]  We canceled the press conference, blah, blah, blah, on and on and on.
[01:41:55.760 --> 01:41:57.120]  They do not want this out.
[01:41:57.120 --> 01:41:58.440]  They do not want this discussed.
[01:41:58.440 --> 01:42:00.200]  They do not want you talking about it.
[01:42:00.200 --> 01:42:04.760]  They do not, they needed to blame the Patriot Tea Party for this so bad.
[01:42:04.760 --> 01:42:07.840]  And again, how did I know they were gonna blame us?
[01:42:07.840 --> 01:42:10.560]  States Day, Tax Day, that's not how I knew.
[01:42:10.560 --> 01:42:12.400]  That added to it.
[01:42:12.400 --> 01:42:17.600]  The White House operatives that run CNN and MSNBC have been licking their lips for the
[01:42:17.600 --> 01:42:21.620]  last month, saying an attack is imminent and that we're horrible murderers and soon everyone
[01:42:21.620 --> 01:42:22.620]  will see.
[01:42:22.620 --> 01:42:25.120]  I mean, they are operating like you're so stupid.
[01:42:25.120 --> 01:42:28.920]  I mean, when Robert Shapiro two years ago wrote for the Financial Times of London, we
[01:42:28.920 --> 01:42:33.680]  need a new Oklahoma City to be blamed on our political opposition so Obama can be popular.
[01:42:33.680 --> 01:42:37.220]  I'm like, folks, they think you're stupid.
[01:42:37.220 --> 01:42:41.840]  They're having like consigliere mafia meetings in the newspaper.
[01:42:41.840 --> 01:42:43.360]  They think you're so dumb.
[01:42:43.360 --> 01:42:51.800]  I mean, one Bible page separation from saying they did it or need to do it.
[01:42:51.800 --> 01:42:57.080]  I mean, that's like Gary Hart on the CFR Commission wrote public letters and a paper saying we
[01:42:57.080 --> 01:43:01.200]  need staged terror attacks just like Penac did the September 20th, Rebuilding America's
[01:43:01.200 --> 01:43:02.200]  Defenses thing.
[01:43:02.200 --> 01:43:07.520]  And then one time we are changed, it's in my film Truth Rising, found him at an event.
[01:43:07.520 --> 01:43:10.680]  He was at a book signing and came up and said, you wrote those letters and put out that public
[01:43:10.680 --> 01:43:14.480]  report saying we staged terror attacks in America and that we should do it again.
[01:43:14.480 --> 01:43:15.480]  He goes, no, I didn't.
[01:43:15.480 --> 01:43:16.480]  What are you talking about, son?
[01:43:16.480 --> 01:43:17.720]  They go, well, here's your letter.
[01:43:17.720 --> 01:43:24.320]  And when he read it, he started sweating and going, oh, well, I, that was a mock letter.
[01:43:24.320 --> 01:43:25.860]  They don't even think of us as human.
[01:43:25.860 --> 01:43:31.660]  You publish this stuff in the CFR, you publish this stuff publicly and we're not supposed
[01:43:31.660 --> 01:43:34.080]  to go with a copy of it?
[01:43:34.080 --> 01:43:37.240]  Like you think we're animals like all these other people?
[01:43:37.240 --> 01:43:38.680]  You think I don't see?
[01:43:38.680 --> 01:43:42.540]  You don't think I don't know you wanna raise my property taxes and cut the Second Amendment
[01:43:42.540 --> 01:43:44.240]  and take my kids from me?
[01:43:44.240 --> 01:43:46.920]  And you say the state runs my kids on MSNBC?
[01:43:46.920 --> 01:43:49.280]  You don't think we're not gonna fight you?
[01:43:49.280 --> 01:43:52.360]  You don't think we don't know you're gonna blow stuff up and try to blame us?
[01:43:52.360 --> 01:44:00.400]  You don't think we're not watching now, you rat bastards?
[01:44:00.400 --> 01:44:03.440]  You don't think there's not fight left around here?
[01:44:03.440 --> 01:44:06.640]  Not all of us are in comas watching TV, buddy.
[01:44:06.640 --> 01:44:11.820]  Not all of us are busy down at the bar watching UFC, looking tough in front of our buddies.
[01:44:11.820 --> 01:44:13.840]  Not all of us are here to be run over.
[01:44:13.840 --> 01:44:19.720]  Not all of us are fake men.
[01:44:19.720 --> 01:44:24.800]  You know how slime, I've got countless clips of CNN, MSNBC, even yesterday going, you know
[01:44:24.800 --> 01:44:26.880]  it's gun owners did this.
[01:44:26.880 --> 01:44:30.080]  You know they use powder from the gun shops to do it.
[01:44:30.080 --> 01:44:31.360]  I mean, I even predicted that.
[01:44:31.360 --> 01:44:34.920]  I mean, they've got their whole script, they're told, don't worry, we're gonna get them real
[01:44:34.920 --> 01:44:35.920]  soon.
[01:44:35.920 --> 01:44:38.040]  We'll get the gun bill passed, something's about to happen.
[01:44:38.040 --> 01:44:40.080]  Just go tell people they're the ones that are gonna do it.
[01:44:40.080 --> 01:44:41.080]  Really?
[01:44:41.080 --> 01:44:42.080]  Tell me, let me in on it.
[01:44:42.080 --> 01:44:44.680]  You're not high level enough, but we're gonna burn these people.
[01:44:44.680 --> 01:44:48.440]  We're taking this country over, high five, yeah, yeah.
[01:44:48.440 --> 01:44:52.400]  Then we could torture all we want and it won't be Iraqis we're torturing.
[01:44:52.400 --> 01:44:57.080]  It'll be all these patriots, hot wives and their kids.
[01:44:57.080 --> 01:45:00.640]  They're all in there just high five, media matters.
[01:45:00.640 --> 01:45:06.600]  Southern Poverty Law Center, high five, America's art, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:45:06.600 --> 01:45:08.520]  Go ahead and try to say we did it now.
[01:45:08.520 --> 01:45:12.280]  Go ahead, go ahead and make my day.
[01:45:12.280 --> 01:45:14.600]  I probably shouldn't taunt them so much, but you know what?
[01:45:14.600 --> 01:45:16.080]  Do whatever you're gonna do to me.
[01:45:16.080 --> 01:45:20.200]  Just if you ever do take me out, don't think I didn't know, okay?
[01:45:20.200 --> 01:45:25.080]  I'm not a coward like you.
[01:45:25.080 --> 01:45:28.160]  I mean, I see you, that's not any trick.
[01:45:28.160 --> 01:45:32.640]  You people are just over the top obvious.
[01:45:32.640 --> 01:45:37.520]  Captain obvious on steroids to the power of infinity.
[01:45:37.520 --> 01:45:43.840]  To captain obvious in infinity and beyond.
[01:45:43.840 --> 01:45:48.640]  I mean, you people are running around in Democratic fundraising letters saying to your million
[01:45:48.640 --> 01:45:51.480]  dollar donors, don't worry, they'll be in New Oklahoma City.
[01:45:51.480 --> 01:45:52.800]  We're gonna win our agenda.
[01:45:52.800 --> 01:45:54.580]  Your money's well spent with us.
[01:45:54.580 --> 01:46:03.080]  And letting their donors in like, don't worry, we're gonna blow stuff up.
[01:46:03.080 --> 01:46:08.560]  I mean, I have to sit here and watch these psychos on power trips reading their teleprompters
[01:46:08.560 --> 01:46:14.120]  on MSNBC going, all their twinkly eyes of just criminal energy just going, and you know
[01:46:14.120 --> 01:46:17.640]  it's NRA that did this bombing and they're gonna get these people.
[01:46:17.640 --> 01:46:23.800]  I mean, just over the top authoritarian scum.
[01:46:23.800 --> 01:46:26.640]  Let's go back to a real reporter, Dan Madani from infowars.com.
[01:46:26.640 --> 01:46:30.960]  At the end of the press conference with the governor, at the end he says, you know what,
[01:46:30.960 --> 01:46:31.960]  let's play the whole thing end to end.
[01:46:31.960 --> 01:46:32.960]  Cue it back up at the start.
[01:46:32.960 --> 01:46:37.440]  I want people to hear the press conference, because again, this happened on Monday, it
[01:46:37.440 --> 01:46:38.440]  was just off the news.
[01:46:38.440 --> 01:46:42.240]  It was bad audio, but still freaked everybody out in the establishment, and false flags
[01:46:42.240 --> 01:46:43.400]  are one of the top search terms.
[01:46:43.400 --> 01:46:46.160]  By the way, search the term false flag, let's send it to number one.
[01:46:46.160 --> 01:46:49.120]  Do it right now, folks, I think I'm gonna do it.
[01:46:49.120 --> 01:46:51.120]  Here is the press conference, here it is.
[01:46:51.120 --> 01:46:55.360]  Is there any security footage of any of these explosions?
[01:46:55.360 --> 01:46:58.880]  We are looking at all of that right now, that's one of the investigative steps that we have
[01:46:58.880 --> 01:46:59.880]  been taking.
[01:46:59.880 --> 01:47:03.560]  Was there any point in our job, because according to BostonGlobe.com, they said they were doing
[01:47:03.560 --> 01:47:07.420]  drills this morning for the same exact thing that happened, according to BostonGlobe.com.
[01:47:07.420 --> 01:47:10.920]  Now were you guys given any warning ahead of time of this taking place?
[01:47:10.920 --> 01:47:14.000]  As I said earlier, there was no specific intelligence.
[01:47:14.000 --> 01:47:17.640]  We certainly increased our posture around a big event like this.
[01:47:17.640 --> 01:47:21.280]  All of those things happened in preparation for this event, but there was no specific
[01:47:21.280 --> 01:47:23.000]  intelligence that anything was going to happen.
[01:47:23.000 --> 01:47:25.720]  And can you talk a little bit about what type of device do you have?
[01:47:25.720 --> 01:47:31.680]  The city of Boston is open and will be open tomorrow, but it will not be business as usual.
[01:47:31.680 --> 01:47:37.440]  It will be a heightened law enforcement presence consistent with the severity and seriousness
[01:47:37.440 --> 01:47:38.440]  of the ongoing investigation.
[01:47:38.440 --> 01:47:45.000]  People should expect, those who are riding the T, that there will be random checks of
[01:47:45.000 --> 01:47:48.200]  the backpacks and other parcels.
[01:47:48.200 --> 01:47:52.240]  And we just ask everyone for patience with that inconvenience for the time being.
[01:47:52.240 --> 01:47:55.280]  It is for the public's sake.
[01:47:55.280 --> 01:48:00.280]  Here in the state, at the local level and at the federal level, we are all coming together
[01:48:00.280 --> 01:48:04.320]  to do everything we can to get to the bottom of this.
[01:48:04.320 --> 01:48:08.080]  The most important fact that I want to convey to everybody this evening has already been
[01:48:08.080 --> 01:48:09.960]  mentioned by Governor Patrick.
[01:48:09.960 --> 01:48:13.520]  The FBI is taking the lead in this investigation.
[01:48:13.520 --> 01:48:15.080]  It is a certain federal jurisdiction.
[01:48:15.080 --> 01:48:19.760]  It will do so through the Boston Joint Terrorism Task Force, members of which are comprised
[01:48:19.760 --> 01:48:24.320]  by all the members of the law enforcement agencies here represented at the podium.
[01:48:24.320 --> 01:48:27.000]  This will be a combined federal, state, and local effort.
[01:48:27.000 --> 01:48:29.840]  It will be an ongoing investigation.
[01:48:29.840 --> 01:48:35.840]  It is a criminal investigation that has the potential, is a potential terrorist investigation.
[01:48:35.840 --> 01:48:37.920]  If you take any questions.
[01:48:37.920 --> 01:48:42.480]  Sir, why would a lot of speakers tell people in the audience to be calm moments before
[01:48:42.480 --> 01:48:43.680]  the bomb went off?
[01:48:43.680 --> 01:48:47.200]  Is this another false flag stage attack to take on several liberties and put more homeland
[01:48:47.200 --> 01:48:49.960]  security by sticking their hands down on the pants on the streets?
[01:48:49.960 --> 01:48:50.960]  No.
[01:48:50.960 --> 01:48:51.960]  Next question.
[01:48:51.960 --> 01:48:52.960]  You have said that there's no suspect but is there a false one?
[01:48:52.960 --> 01:48:53.960]  I'm not going to confirm that right now.
[01:48:53.960 --> 01:48:54.960]  We'll have that information for you first thing in the morning.
[01:48:54.960 --> 01:48:55.960]  The medical people are compiling that as we speak.
[01:48:55.960 --> 01:48:56.960]  Again, why would speakers tell people to be, you know, characterizing the fact of terrorism?
[01:48:56.960 --> 01:48:57.960]  The extent of the injuries, how serious people are.
[01:48:57.960 --> 01:48:58.960]  This is a very powerful point.
[01:48:58.960 --> 01:49:13.000]  Right now, that area that the governor outlined is our main point of focus right now.
[01:49:13.000 --> 01:49:17.560]  Again, why would people telling speakers telling people to be calm before the bomb went off?
[01:49:17.560 --> 01:49:18.560]  I want to answer that question.
[01:49:18.560 --> 01:49:22.560]  Currently in your search for additional devices, are you searching the entire route of the
[01:49:22.560 --> 01:49:24.400]  marathon or are you just focused on certain areas right now?
[01:49:24.400 --> 01:49:27.880]  Are there specific areas that you're focused on beyond the Copley area?
[01:49:27.880 --> 01:49:31.880]  At this point in time, our focus on the investigation is in the areas of the governor mentioned.
[01:49:31.880 --> 01:49:33.880]  Why was people being told to fly into the bomb going off?
[01:49:33.880 --> 01:49:34.880]  Are there any other counter core people?
[01:49:34.880 --> 01:49:35.880]  If so, how would you know?
[01:49:35.880 --> 01:49:41.120]  We're actually working very closely with the families right now.
[01:49:41.120 --> 01:49:46.800]  We're setting up a location near here that families can come to if they have any questions.
[01:49:46.800 --> 01:49:52.040]  The mayor's office has fielded many calls of concern.
[01:49:52.040 --> 01:49:57.040]  We're going through those right now.
[01:49:57.040 --> 01:50:03.440]  Why was people being told prior to the bombs going off to stay calm?
[01:50:03.440 --> 01:50:04.440]  That's a false flag, gentlemen.
[01:50:04.440 --> 01:50:18.320]  Just to put more TSA on the street to rob our civil liberties.
[01:50:18.320 --> 01:50:21.200]  It is not new and it is not order.
[01:50:21.200 --> 01:50:22.200]  It is a new world order.
[01:50:22.200 --> 01:50:23.760]  And he was talking about Hitler at that time.
[01:50:23.760 --> 01:50:25.240]  He talked about his new world order.
[01:50:25.240 --> 01:50:27.400]  That's what fascist always talk about.
[01:50:27.400 --> 01:50:31.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, that's what psycho guilds talk about.
[01:50:31.000 --> 01:50:33.740]  Ladies and gentlemen, they did do the drill.
[01:50:33.740 --> 01:50:35.080]  It was used as the cover.
[01:50:35.080 --> 01:50:37.800]  They were all around the guys when the bombs went off.
[01:50:37.800 --> 01:50:41.080]  There's no way they didn't stop them by accident and like we're running.
[01:50:41.080 --> 01:50:42.380]  Stop the bomb and it went off.
[01:50:42.380 --> 01:50:47.460]  They were all right there in plain view and they think you're so stupid.
[01:50:47.460 --> 01:50:49.520]  There's high def video and photo everywhere.
[01:50:49.520 --> 01:50:53.280]  They're now admitting that we were right, that we broke it, but not giving us credit.
[01:50:53.280 --> 01:50:54.280]  And it's hidden in plain view.
[01:50:54.280 --> 01:50:57.960]  We'll give the number out, open phones in the next hour, and then the gun grabbers throwing
[01:50:57.960 --> 01:51:00.040]  fits that they haven't gotten our guns yet.
[01:51:00.040 --> 01:51:04.320]  But don't worry, they've got schizophrenics on drugs, wound up, probably putting guns
[01:51:04.320 --> 01:51:08.320]  in their hands right now.
[01:51:08.320 --> 01:51:12.400]  In the last two years alone, the U.S. has seen huge losses to our food supply.
[01:51:12.400 --> 01:51:17.600]  In 2011, storms and floods raged across the U.S., costing us 20 billion in lost crops
[01:51:17.600 --> 01:51:18.600]  alone.
[01:51:18.600 --> 01:51:22.120]  In 2012, we saw the largest drought in the country in more than 50 years.
[01:51:22.120 --> 01:51:25.980]  You may think out of sight, out of mind, and so you don't think you will be affected.
[01:51:25.980 --> 01:51:27.400]  The fact is you are.
[01:51:27.400 --> 01:51:28.560]  We all are.
[01:51:28.560 --> 01:51:31.040]  Food shortages drive prices up for everyone.
[01:51:31.040 --> 01:51:35.800]  You might not be able to control mother nature, but you can control your food prices by freezing
[01:51:35.800 --> 01:51:39.520]  the cost and availability of your food supply with eFoods Direct.
[01:51:39.520 --> 01:51:44.360]  Be prepared before you need it with nutrient-dense food you can store for up to 25 years.
[01:51:44.360 --> 01:51:46.720]  You can hope for the best, but hope won't feed you.
[01:51:46.720 --> 01:51:50.360]  Do what I've done and get your own supply of the best, durable foods out there from
[01:51:50.360 --> 01:51:51.360]  eFoods Direct.
[01:51:51.360 --> 01:51:57.400]  Call 800-409-5633 or visit them on the web at eFoodsDirect.com forward slash Alex and
[01:51:57.400 --> 01:51:58.960]  check out their spring specials.
[01:51:58.960 --> 01:52:05.520]  Again, that number is 800-409-5633 or on the web at eFoodsDirect.com forward slash Alex.
[01:52:05.520 --> 01:52:07.880]  You can bet your life on eFoods Direct.
[01:52:07.880 --> 01:52:10.280]  It's time for a home security quiz.
[01:52:10.280 --> 01:52:14.800]  What effective home security device is smaller than a coffee cup fakes out burglars into
[01:52:14.800 --> 01:52:19.440]  thinking someone is home at your house while you're away, plugs into any wall outlet, is
[01:52:19.440 --> 01:52:23.880]  recommended by many police departments, and sells for less than $30?
[01:52:23.880 --> 01:52:26.240]  Yes, it's fake TV.
[01:52:26.240 --> 01:52:30.520]  This year, about one in every 50 U.S. homes will have a break-in with burglars usually
[01:52:30.520 --> 01:52:34.900]  picking the easy target, a dark house that looks like no one is home.
[01:52:34.900 --> 01:52:39.900]  Fake TV is a small electronic security device that makes it look like someone is home watching
[01:52:39.900 --> 01:52:43.480]  TV by simulating the light from a real TV.
[01:52:43.480 --> 01:52:48.320]  Fake TV could be the difference between coming home to a secure house or one that's been
[01:52:48.320 --> 01:52:49.320]  ransacked.
[01:52:49.320 --> 01:52:53.240]  Get your fake TV for only $29.95 with free shipping.
[01:52:53.240 --> 01:52:58.640]  Go to faketv.com or call 1-877-5FAKETV.
[01:52:58.640 --> 01:53:04.760]  That's 877-532-5388 or go to faketv.com.
[01:53:04.760 --> 01:53:08.560]  Fake TV, the burglar deterrent.
[01:53:08.560 --> 01:53:12.440]  Imagine waking one morning only to find your family shivering in the dark because you couldn't
[01:53:12.440 --> 01:53:14.680]  afford to pay your electric bill.
[01:53:14.680 --> 01:53:16.420]  That's closer than you think.
[01:53:16.420 --> 01:53:19.720]  You probably haven't heard about this yet because the liberal media has been suppressing
[01:53:19.720 --> 01:53:26.000]  what is fast becoming the most shocking news story of 2012, Obama's secret war on coal
[01:53:26.000 --> 01:53:31.320]  that could increase your already high power bill as much as 400% in coming months.
[01:53:31.320 --> 01:53:35.680]  As shocking as it sounds, it may well be just a matter of time before the lights start going
[01:53:35.680 --> 01:53:37.640]  out across America.
[01:53:37.640 --> 01:53:39.040]  But here's some good news.
[01:53:39.040 --> 01:53:44.800]  There's an underground video at exposed123.com that thousands of smart patriots have used
[01:53:44.800 --> 01:53:48.480]  to end their slavery to the corrupt electricity monopoly.
[01:53:48.480 --> 01:53:53.680]  The video at exposed123.com has already been banned by Google and the liberal media is
[01:53:53.680 --> 01:53:57.760]  doing everything in its power to take it down and keep America in the dark.
[01:53:57.760 --> 01:54:02.160]  So watch it now at exposed123.com before it's too late.
[01:54:02.160 --> 01:54:04.120]  Again, that's exposed123.com.
[01:54:04.120 --> 01:54:16.200]  Monday through Friday, 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. Central.
[01:54:16.200 --> 01:54:17.200]  We're here live.
[01:54:17.200 --> 01:54:19.240]  It is Thursday, the 18th day of April, 2013.
[01:54:19.240 --> 01:54:23.400]  I'm going to have Ja'Kari Jackson and David Knight on.
[01:54:23.400 --> 01:54:29.120]  They're trying to pass the CISPA bill, restrict our free speech right now, the open borders,
[01:54:29.120 --> 01:54:30.120]  other things.
[01:54:30.120 --> 01:54:31.680]  We've defeated the gun grab before now.
[01:54:31.680 --> 01:54:33.440]  They're going to be here for two hours of overdrive.
[01:54:33.440 --> 01:54:36.240]  Some stations do carry that fourth hour and the fifth hours.
[01:54:36.240 --> 01:54:39.520]  Video streams and audio at info.wars.com forward slash listen.
[01:54:39.520 --> 01:54:41.040]  That's free for everybody right now.
[01:54:41.040 --> 01:54:43.760]  The bandwidth is extremely expensive.
[01:54:43.760 --> 01:54:46.000]  This is historical stuff you're seeing here.
[01:54:46.000 --> 01:54:49.200]  Most people are not maniac enough to go up against the new world order.
[01:54:49.200 --> 01:54:51.320]  Most people are scared to die.
[01:54:51.320 --> 01:54:55.240]  I love life so much that I'm willing to do whatever it takes and I don't expect that
[01:54:55.240 --> 01:54:56.240]  to happen.
[01:54:56.240 --> 01:54:57.400]  I'll never commit suicide.
[01:54:57.400 --> 01:55:03.480]  But my gut tells me this is more dangerous than anything I've ever done.
[01:55:03.480 --> 01:55:05.360]  This is more dangerous than anything I've ever done.
[01:55:05.360 --> 01:55:09.400]  I've had a sports car up to 175 miles an hour.
[01:55:09.400 --> 01:55:11.120]  I'm sorry, I actually didn't do that, police.
[01:55:11.120 --> 01:55:12.120]  Sorry.
[01:55:12.120 --> 01:55:13.120]  I'm not going to tell a lie.
[01:55:13.120 --> 01:55:20.040]  The point is is that this is the most dangerous thing I have ever done and it's because this
[01:55:20.040 --> 01:55:25.120]  country and everything good in the world was founded on guts and it was founded on telling
[01:55:25.120 --> 01:55:26.120]  the truth.
[01:55:26.120 --> 01:55:30.040]  So if you know evil's going on, you got to not lie to yourself about it and rationalize
[01:55:30.040 --> 01:55:32.600]  and be all shaky and oh, who knows?
[01:55:32.600 --> 01:55:33.600]  No.
[01:55:33.600 --> 01:55:37.320]  Day one I said I saw the buildup to this false flag and this is exactly what it looks like
[01:55:37.320 --> 01:55:38.320]  now.
[01:55:38.320 --> 01:55:41.840]  And now Harry Reid is talking about false flags as he throws fits saying that they've
[01:55:41.840 --> 01:55:43.720]  been unable to get our guns.
[01:55:43.720 --> 01:55:45.400]  Here's a clip of that.
[01:55:45.400 --> 01:55:47.300]  We can keep them off the streets.
[01:55:47.300 --> 01:55:49.200]  We should keep them off the streets.
[01:55:49.200 --> 01:55:50.880]  You got plenty of guns, don't you, bud?
[01:55:50.880 --> 01:55:54.080]  In the 1920s, organized crime was committing murders with machine guns.
[01:55:54.080 --> 01:55:55.080]  We've seen them.
[01:55:55.080 --> 01:55:56.640]  That was used to restrict our guns.
[01:55:56.640 --> 01:55:59.160]  Valentine Valentine's Day massacre.
[01:55:59.160 --> 01:56:00.600]  They still got them.
[01:56:00.600 --> 01:56:04.200]  So Congress dramatically limited the sale and transfer of machine guns.
[01:56:04.200 --> 01:56:05.200]  Yeah.
[01:56:05.200 --> 01:56:06.200]  Full auto.
[01:56:06.200 --> 01:56:07.200]  You don't even need that.
[01:56:07.200 --> 01:56:08.200]  Long time ago.
[01:56:08.200 --> 01:56:09.200]  A bunch of bull started to take our guns then, traitor.
[01:56:09.200 --> 01:56:12.760]  Machine guns basically disappeared from the streets.
[01:56:12.760 --> 01:56:18.640]  They're in movies, but not private citizens had them.
[01:56:18.640 --> 01:56:21.120]  We can and should make the same common sense approach.
[01:56:21.120 --> 01:56:25.440]  Crime dropped 49% the last 20 years, punk.
[01:56:25.440 --> 01:56:27.220]  Assault weapons.
[01:56:27.220 --> 01:56:29.800]  That's why I will vote for Diane Feinstein.
[01:56:29.800 --> 01:56:32.880]  But you're a criminal who only wants the guns for yourself, punk.
[01:56:32.880 --> 01:56:37.280]  Because we must strike a better balance between the right to defend ourselves and the right
[01:56:37.280 --> 01:56:40.480]  of every child in America to grow up safe from gun violence.
[01:56:40.480 --> 01:56:44.200]  Like the ones that got blown up at the- I'll vote for the band because maintaining
[01:56:44.200 --> 01:56:50.880]  a law and order is more important than satisfying conspiracy theories who believe in black helicopters
[01:56:50.880 --> 01:56:51.880]  Oh, really?
[01:56:51.880 --> 01:56:52.880]  And false flags.
[01:56:52.880 --> 01:56:53.880]  Oh.
[01:56:53.880 --> 01:56:54.880]  Turn him off.
[01:56:54.880 --> 01:56:57.880]  That's enough of that, punk.
[01:56:57.880 --> 01:56:59.800]  Listen, we're getting to them.
[01:56:59.800 --> 01:57:00.800]  They don't like it.
[01:57:00.800 --> 01:57:01.800]  Full speed ahead.
[01:57:01.800 --> 01:57:02.920]  Intensify operations.
[01:57:02.920 --> 01:57:04.520]  Just discredit them.
[01:57:04.520 --> 01:57:07.900]  Every time you email one of our stories, every time you talk about false flags, every time
[01:57:07.900 --> 01:57:12.680]  you expose what they've done, every time you just bring them closer to defeat.
[01:57:12.680 --> 01:57:14.400]  And they're all running scared now.
[01:57:14.400 --> 01:57:18.680]  And I see when press conferences, they are just freaked out because they know we're getting
[01:57:18.680 --> 01:57:19.720]  so close.
[01:57:19.720 --> 01:57:21.740]  They've committed this crime out in the open.
[01:57:21.740 --> 01:57:24.280]  And they're hoping the media doesn't let it leak.
[01:57:24.280 --> 01:57:29.240]  They're hoping no one points out all the other people there and the handlers with the patsies.
[01:57:29.240 --> 01:57:30.240]  They don't know what to do.
[01:57:30.240 --> 01:57:31.240]  They had the fake arrest.
[01:57:31.240 --> 01:57:32.920]  They were going to announce it was a gun owner.
[01:57:32.920 --> 01:57:34.240]  They had everything.
[01:57:34.240 --> 01:57:38.080]  And now it's all screwed up by the grace of God.
[01:57:38.080 --> 01:57:40.280]  You wanted to frame us and now you can't.
[01:57:40.280 --> 01:57:44.480]  So better carry out another false flag real quick, huh?
[01:57:44.480 --> 01:57:45.680]  You guys always do the same thing.
[01:57:45.680 --> 01:57:47.560]  So I've been thinking about what they'll do.
[01:57:47.560 --> 01:57:52.920]  They'll probably blow some more stuff up and they might have set the fire at that thing
[01:57:52.920 --> 01:57:53.920]  up in Texas.
[01:57:53.920 --> 01:57:56.140]  And that's a perfect thing to get this out of the news.
[01:57:56.140 --> 01:57:57.140]  They're in total panic mode.
[01:57:57.140 --> 01:57:58.840]  I don't know that.
[01:57:58.840 --> 01:58:00.680]  I don't have evidence of that, so we don't know.
[01:58:00.680 --> 01:58:06.040]  But they do this kind of stuff, so they are prime suspects.
[01:58:06.040 --> 01:58:10.580]  Also go to infowarsstore.com and buy the books, the high quality water filters, the lowest

[01:58:35.220 --> 01:58:36.320]  The lowest prices out there.
[01:58:36.320 --> 01:58:40.280]  Hey, I told Weldon to lower the price on that particular one right there to $36.
[01:58:40.280 --> 01:58:42.720]  I want the lowest price out there.
[01:58:42.720 --> 01:58:48.680]  infowarsstore.com, third hour, coming up.
[01:58:48.680 --> 01:58:58.000]  You are listening to GCN, visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:58:58.000 --> 01:59:02.840]  A little over a year ago, I began to do a lot of research into why, even though I had
[01:59:02.840 --> 01:59:05.360]  a pretty good sized meal, that I was still starving.
[01:59:05.360 --> 01:59:10.160]  And my research led me to a well-known fact that most of the soils that we grow our crops
[01:59:10.160 --> 01:59:14.320]  on here in the United States and across the industrialized world are almost completely
[01:59:14.320 --> 01:59:20.000]  depleted of almost all of the key minerals and trace elements that our bodies need to
[01:59:20.000 --> 01:59:23.060]  rebuild themselves, fight off cancer, and be healthy.
[01:59:23.060 --> 01:59:29.360]  I then searched out the best vitamin and mineral company out there and discovered Young Jevity.
[01:59:29.360 --> 01:59:33.520]  The Young Jevity products are designed to give you the real nutrition you need.
[01:59:33.520 --> 01:59:37.320]  And once you've got that, you don't have to eat as much to be satisfied.
[01:59:37.320 --> 01:59:43.760]  I've lost 37 pounds in two months, simply getting the vitamins and minerals I need.
[01:59:43.760 --> 01:59:45.160]  Check it out for yourself.
[01:59:45.160 --> 01:59:46.160]  It's incredible.

[02:00:01.040 --> 02:00:12.800]  Waging war on corruption, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:12.800 --> 02:00:17.600]  Big brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[02:00:17.600 --> 02:00:18.600]  You want answers?
[02:00:18.600 --> 02:00:20.760]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:20.760 --> 02:00:24.960]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:24.960 --> 02:00:29.960]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:29.960 --> 02:00:37.000]  Yeah, LL Lemnon, sir, in 1961 and two, wanted to bomb Marine Corps bases, this is declassified,
[02:00:37.000 --> 02:00:40.520]  killing Marines to blame it on Cuba.
[02:00:40.520 --> 02:00:43.560]  He thought it was best to kill Marines to take out communism.
[02:00:43.560 --> 02:00:47.560]  But the globalists were actually funding communism, so they didn't let him do that.
[02:00:47.560 --> 02:00:50.720]  But you can see how a guy that even thought he was a good guy had Thomas Jefferson quotes
[02:00:50.720 --> 02:00:57.800]  in his office, turned to evil, studying Operation Himmler.
[02:00:57.800 --> 02:01:01.620]  The Pentagon studied Operation Himmler, a Nazi operation of false flags that led to
[02:01:01.620 --> 02:01:05.040]  World War II, and that's why they did that.
[02:01:05.040 --> 02:01:08.560]  And so my point is, if our government would kill our own troops to get a war going, of
[02:01:08.560 --> 02:01:09.760]  course they'd blow that up.
[02:01:09.760 --> 02:01:11.680]  Let's put the little boy on screen.
[02:01:11.680 --> 02:01:16.360]  The eight-year-old the media has been using, poor little eight-year-old, print me an article
[02:01:16.360 --> 02:01:17.360]  about him.
[02:01:17.360 --> 02:01:20.840]  I wanna talk about him after we take calls coming up.
[02:01:20.840 --> 02:01:24.840]  They're using him, I mean, imagine he died in the Boston Marathon, and they'll put out
[02:01:24.840 --> 02:01:30.120]  fake conspiracies saying nobody died to discredit us all, that's a Kat Sunstein option.
[02:01:30.120 --> 02:01:33.640]  But then there's also some mentally ill people out there that think nothing's real because
[02:01:33.640 --> 02:01:34.880]  they've lost confidence in the government.
[02:01:34.880 --> 02:01:39.280]  See, a lot of idiots now know the government's lying, so they don't believe anything.
[02:01:39.280 --> 02:01:42.120]  Just cuz the government's lying all the time and doing stuff doesn't mean that everything
[02:01:42.120 --> 02:01:43.560]  is a lie.
[02:01:43.560 --> 02:01:45.560]  Or does it mean that nothing happened at Sandy Hook?
[02:01:45.560 --> 02:01:49.200]  No, no, no, no, if they ever got a chance to kill some real kids, they're going to.
[02:01:49.200 --> 02:01:51.560]  Cuz they enjoy their work.
[02:01:51.560 --> 02:01:55.240]  Cuz if you've killed adults and stuff, I mean, the only thing that really makes you feel
[02:01:55.240 --> 02:01:56.840]  dark and powerful is to kill little kids.
[02:01:56.840 --> 02:02:00.160]  I mean, I've studied history, I've studied criminology, and our hearts go out to that
[02:02:00.160 --> 02:02:02.280]  little boy's parents.
[02:02:02.280 --> 02:02:07.640]  But I pray for him, he's with his Heavenly Father right now in a better place, and when
[02:02:07.640 --> 02:02:10.480]  we all die, we'll join him in Valhalla.
[02:02:10.480 --> 02:02:17.160]  But I don't think we've reached that stage in our lives yet, have we?
[02:02:17.160 --> 02:02:19.880]  I have extreme empathy for people.
[02:02:19.880 --> 02:02:24.240]  I don't have a transitory, fake, emotional thing, where I only have empathy when the
[02:02:24.240 --> 02:02:26.160]  government and the media tells me it's okay.
[02:02:26.160 --> 02:02:29.760]  Iraqis kill them all, glass parking lot, they're not human, yeah.
[02:02:29.760 --> 02:02:33.840]  But then you see somebody, they tell you to care about your life, it's terrible, and then
[02:02:33.840 --> 02:02:37.400]  they were gonna say, the Tea Party blew him up.
[02:02:37.400 --> 02:02:39.600]  Can you believe those dirty gun owners?
[02:02:39.600 --> 02:02:47.920]  MSNBC was gonna come on and act real sad and go, the little boy killed by the gun owners,
[02:02:47.920 --> 02:02:50.440]  killed by the dirty Tea Party people.
[02:02:50.440 --> 02:02:52.680]  We're gonna go to commercial, the President's coming back with his press conference right
[02:02:52.680 --> 02:02:53.680]  now.
[02:02:53.680 --> 02:02:56.000]  Is there nothing the Tea Party won't do?
[02:02:56.000 --> 02:03:04.680]  They're so in love, we better take their guns.
[02:03:04.680 --> 02:03:08.080]  We come back, I'm gonna give the number out and take your phone calls on this situation.
[02:03:08.080 --> 02:03:10.380]  Do you agree with me this is the biggest thing ever?
[02:03:10.380 --> 02:03:12.720]  What is your take on this?
[02:03:12.720 --> 02:03:20.180]  They think you're so stupid that they would have Army, Navy SEALs, special ops people
[02:03:20.180 --> 02:03:24.040]  everywhere with giant black bags hiding in doorways, standing around Saudis, standing
[02:03:24.040 --> 02:03:26.440]  around rednecks they were gonna set up.
[02:03:26.440 --> 02:03:30.280]  It does look like the redneck's bag that matches, that's why he fits into so many points.
[02:03:30.280 --> 02:03:34.480]  And then we break it, it's confirmed, they're in total damage control only showing the Saudis
[02:03:34.480 --> 02:03:38.840]  in freefall craziness with emergency meetings at the White House with the Saudi foreign
[02:03:38.840 --> 02:03:39.840]  minister.
[02:03:39.840 --> 02:03:43.440]  This is cuckoo land.
[02:03:43.440 --> 02:03:48.680]  This is totally insane and I cannot believe that there's not more people in the media
[02:03:48.680 --> 02:03:50.400]  that will cover this and talk about it.
[02:03:50.400 --> 02:03:54.480]  That it's in fallwars.com and my crew and drudgereport.com that linked to it yesterday
[02:03:54.480 --> 02:03:56.880]  night and this morning.
[02:03:56.880 --> 02:04:04.460]  I mean, it's just, it is so incredible.
[02:04:04.460 --> 02:04:10.040]  But again, they just hope it just kind of sits there and the media, all guaranteed in
[02:04:10.040 --> 02:04:11.040]  newsrooms everywhere.
[02:04:11.040 --> 02:04:16.060]  They wanna run with the photos of the Navy SEALs and the Army and the redneck.
[02:04:16.060 --> 02:04:20.140]  And you know MSNBC and CNN had it all loaded days ago.
[02:04:20.140 --> 02:04:23.760]  The photos were now, they had to build it up, who done it, and they were already ready.
[02:04:23.760 --> 02:04:27.440]  That's why they were like saying, yeah, it's a lone wolf and it's not Saudi Arabia.
[02:04:27.440 --> 02:04:30.460]  That's what we're getting from the Justice Department, Axelrod says, but we're not gonna
[02:04:30.460 --> 02:04:31.460]  tell you yet.
[02:04:31.460 --> 02:04:34.100]  We wanna make sure they're like, we got these people.
[02:04:34.100 --> 02:04:35.560]  Come on, can't we break it?
[02:04:35.560 --> 02:04:37.320]  Can't we release the redneck patsy first?
[02:04:37.320 --> 02:04:40.560]  No, no, they've got him on ice.
[02:04:40.560 --> 02:04:41.560]  Just get ready.
[02:04:41.560 --> 02:04:44.360]  Gotta build this up before we destroy the tea party.
[02:04:44.360 --> 02:04:45.480]  All right.
[02:04:45.480 --> 02:04:48.560]  But you waited too long, didn't you?
[02:04:48.560 --> 02:04:50.760]  That's a lesson for you.
[02:04:50.760 --> 02:04:57.160]  You waited too long because we had you off balance exposing false flag and taking over
[02:04:57.160 --> 02:04:59.960]  the press conference that you were looking at things.
[02:04:59.960 --> 02:05:04.200]  And while you waited, we hurt you bad.
[02:05:04.200 --> 02:05:08.120]  But they're not destroyed yet, they're still dangerous.

[02:06:16.080 --> 02:06:22.120]  The globalist model is to shut down societies and starve patriots out until they acquiesce
[02:06:22.120 --> 02:06:23.120]  to the global takeover.

[02:07:37.320 --> 02:07:42.080]  Buy the one to two month sample package and enjoy soaps that are twice as good as what
[02:07:42.080 --> 02:07:47.880]  you're using now or save big with a one to two year supply of soap for all your cleaning
[02:07:47.880 --> 02:07:48.880]  needs.
[02:07:48.880 --> 02:07:50.680]  This is an amazing deal.
[02:07:50.680 --> 02:07:55.880]  You can save thousands of dollars and you will love the way real soap makes you feel.
[02:07:55.880 --> 02:08:23.920]  See them on the web at five star soap.com or call 800-340-7091 for a free catalog.
[02:08:23.920 --> 02:08:25.880]  They're all pretty freaked out right now.
[02:08:25.880 --> 02:08:30.040]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[02:08:30.040 --> 02:08:32.600]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:08:32.600 --> 02:08:36.720]  Oh yeah.
[02:08:36.720 --> 02:08:37.720]  Oh yeah.
[02:08:37.720 --> 02:08:44.300]  These words like violence break the silence at MSNBC, CNN, Fox News, everywhere.
[02:08:44.300 --> 02:08:48.040]  They're being told since yesterday, don't show the photos.
[02:08:48.040 --> 02:08:54.300]  Don't show the photos that Alex Jones broke at info wars.com that show the Saudi Arabians
[02:08:54.300 --> 02:08:58.200]  with what looks like bombs strapped to them right there where the bombs went off.
[02:08:58.200 --> 02:09:02.640]  Don't show the redneck patsies they had set up with cop handlers right next to them.
[02:09:02.640 --> 02:09:07.660]  Don't show all the Navy Seals with black backpacks and special forces everywhere.
[02:09:07.660 --> 02:09:09.660]  Don't show it.
[02:09:09.660 --> 02:09:13.040]  And then you watch this morning as the Justice Department came out and released the very
[02:09:13.040 --> 02:09:18.120]  photo but not all the others as we predicted they would do.
[02:09:18.120 --> 02:09:22.640]  And they said they had who did it in custody and we're gonna release it, but then panicked
[02:09:22.640 --> 02:09:27.720]  and pulled back because then everyone's gonna see all the other John Doe's, all the other
[02:09:27.720 --> 02:09:28.720]  patsies.
[02:09:28.720 --> 02:09:30.120]  They always do that to confuse everything.
[02:09:30.120 --> 02:09:35.820]  At the Kennedy assassination, they had Italian hitmen, special forces hitmen.
[02:09:35.820 --> 02:09:37.740]  They had French hitmen.
[02:09:37.740 --> 02:09:44.280]  They had all these people there and different brigades and CIA and a whole army brigade
[02:09:44.280 --> 02:09:47.600]  standing by for riot control the day before in Dallas.
[02:09:47.600 --> 02:09:50.160]  All of this going on.
[02:09:50.160 --> 02:09:54.400]  So that it's just such a confusing thing because the public thinks of it as one guy coming
[02:09:54.400 --> 02:09:55.400]  after you.
[02:09:55.400 --> 02:09:59.960]  And then they said two days ago, they said Tuesday night, they said we now know it's
[02:09:59.960 --> 02:10:05.640]  a lone person, not the Saudis, not a Middle Eastern, Axelrod says so.
[02:10:05.640 --> 02:10:09.500]  And then by yesterday morning, it was yes, yes, it looks like it's gonna be tea party.
[02:10:09.500 --> 02:10:10.500]  It's gonna be a right winger.
[02:10:10.500 --> 02:10:14.860]  We're not allowed to say more now, but sources, something's moving quickly.
[02:10:14.860 --> 02:10:15.860]  We're going to find out now.
[02:10:15.860 --> 02:10:17.380]  We're gonna be able to tell you who did it.
[02:10:17.380 --> 02:10:19.720]  We're gonna be able to break all this down now.
[02:10:19.720 --> 02:10:22.520]  Ladies and gentlemen, it's the white male.
[02:10:22.520 --> 02:10:23.520]  It's the lone person.
[02:10:23.520 --> 02:10:24.520]  There weren't two people.
[02:10:24.520 --> 02:10:26.320]  There's only one.
[02:10:26.320 --> 02:10:33.000]  And now we see all these people with backpacks, black backpacks looking suspicious.
[02:10:33.000 --> 02:10:38.840]  And the whole thing is blown wide open, and now we have the Navy SEALs with the Navy SEAL
[02:10:38.840 --> 02:10:42.840]  caps walking around directing the police on video.
[02:10:42.840 --> 02:10:47.740]  Guys, will you show the footage of the Navy SEAL with the radiation detector?
[02:10:47.740 --> 02:10:52.800]  Right after the bombs go off, right there in command, and the other guys are standing
[02:10:52.800 --> 02:10:55.680]  around on the street with their big old black backpacks.
[02:10:55.680 --> 02:10:59.840]  And they were standing right there at the end, right there with the guys that blow everything
[02:10:59.840 --> 02:11:05.680]  up, reportedly.
[02:11:05.680 --> 02:11:09.360]  And no, we shouldn't put all these people on the news and ask, who are they?
[02:11:09.360 --> 02:11:12.640]  Cuz there was no drill, even though people said, yeah, people were kind of freaking out
[02:11:12.640 --> 02:11:17.240]  over all the backpacks and dogs, and there was announcements of don't be worried, this
[02:11:17.240 --> 02:11:18.240]  is just a drill.
[02:11:18.240 --> 02:11:28.440]  It was a drill all right, wasn't it?
[02:11:28.440 --> 02:11:33.560]  We even know the type of radiation detector that is, but look, more photos, there's the
[02:11:33.560 --> 02:11:36.400]  very guys running around.
[02:11:36.400 --> 02:11:41.880]  There's more of the Navy SEALs, because that was the unofficial uniform.
[02:11:41.880 --> 02:11:47.440]  The brown combat boots, tan combat boots, tan pants, and black shirts, that was so they
[02:11:47.440 --> 02:11:50.080]  could identify each other.
[02:11:50.080 --> 02:11:53.760]  And they're running around with the inspector radiation alert detector.
[02:11:53.760 --> 02:11:58.000]  So they're there for a bombing drill right where the real bombers just so happen to show
[02:11:58.000 --> 02:11:59.000]  up.
[02:11:59.000 --> 02:12:01.200]  It's almost like, well, they were there obviously stopping and no, they were sent there to do
[02:12:01.200 --> 02:12:05.160]  a drill in case the operatives with the real bombs got caught, they could say they were
[02:12:05.160 --> 02:12:06.160]  part of the drill.
[02:12:06.160 --> 02:12:10.560]  I've been explaining that to you since Monday.
[02:12:10.560 --> 02:12:18.880]  And look, another SEAL, and that's the CRAFT, and what they do is they create organizations
[02:12:18.880 --> 02:12:22.240]  like CRAFT that are really still under national security, so they even have more laws.
[02:12:22.240 --> 02:12:27.920]  Look, look at all the guys with CRAFT insignia, dozens and dozens and dozens.
[02:12:27.920 --> 02:12:32.120]  All these photos coming out, that call Paul Watson, I know Natural News has found more
[02:12:32.120 --> 02:12:36.280]  in post here, to have Watson double doppelganger, all this up to infowars.com.
[02:12:36.280 --> 02:12:39.160]  I know we have most of these, but these are some new ones.
[02:12:39.160 --> 02:12:44.720]  In fact, Teledon and them just copied that article over infowars.com and prisonpond.com.
[02:12:44.720 --> 02:12:49.040]  And look, there's Chris Coll, wearing the exact same outfit, black hat, Punisher Navy
[02:12:49.040 --> 02:12:55.360]  SEAL logo with the red seal on the head, and then the tan pants and the tan boots, that
[02:12:55.360 --> 02:12:57.360]  is the uniform.
[02:12:57.360 --> 02:13:01.000]  And then silting six, silting three, all of them have different versions of that.
[02:13:01.000 --> 02:13:07.720]  And they are crawling all over the event, right next to the guys that detonate.
[02:13:07.720 --> 02:13:13.400]  And there's CRAFT International Expo, them all in uniform.
[02:13:13.400 --> 02:13:15.680]  That's how they dress, that's what they do.
[02:13:15.680 --> 02:13:22.560]  Also Blackwater does that, but they tend to wear black bottoms and black tops.
[02:13:22.560 --> 02:13:26.040]  They all like uniforms, so that's their uniform, so they can all recognize each other.
[02:13:26.040 --> 02:13:28.600]  And the public doesn't even know what they're looking at.
[02:13:28.600 --> 02:13:32.920]  And by the way, we also found some photos of bear claws, people with Blackwater insignias
[02:13:32.920 --> 02:13:33.920]  running around everywhere.
[02:13:33.920 --> 02:13:40.800]  I mean, you had like a mercenary convention down at the end of this thing.
[02:13:40.800 --> 02:13:46.600]  And we go, here's the Saudis, here's the rednecks, here's the handlers right next to them.
[02:13:46.600 --> 02:13:50.400]  I said, they'll probably now when we expose this, go with the Saudis if they're smart.
[02:13:50.400 --> 02:13:53.640]  No one's gonna buy the tea party now, cuz that'll really create scrutiny.
[02:13:53.640 --> 02:13:59.280]  And then they canceled the press conference, as I predicted, they canceled the press conference
[02:13:59.280 --> 02:14:01.720]  and now are saying, we're still looking.
[02:14:01.720 --> 02:14:05.480]  And I don't know who they're gonna say now.
[02:14:05.480 --> 02:14:11.360]  And boy, I feel sorry for the little patsies, if they're even still alive, they may be,
[02:14:11.360 --> 02:14:14.360]  they probably have already been put into an acid bath.
[02:14:14.360 --> 02:14:22.880]  I mean, how dumb do they think we're, there's no drill, they told our reporter.
[02:14:22.880 --> 02:14:27.760]  And then the national media said, how dare Alex Jones, the mega troll, that was the,
[02:14:27.760 --> 02:14:29.940]  was that Yahoo News?
[02:14:29.940 --> 02:14:37.240]  How dare the mega troll send his reporter to ask about a non-existent drill, the scum,
[02:14:37.240 --> 02:14:38.880]  the scum.
[02:14:38.880 --> 02:14:43.560]  And Glenn Beck spent 30 minutes yesterday, last night our crew heard it rebroadcast about
[02:14:43.560 --> 02:14:44.920]  the terrible conspiracy site.
[02:14:44.920 --> 02:14:49.320]  We all know who it is that says there was security people there and that there was a
[02:14:49.320 --> 02:14:50.320]  drill.
[02:14:50.320 --> 02:14:51.480]  God, Alex Jones is just so low.
[02:14:51.480 --> 02:15:00.600]  I mean, there's nothing he won't do, he's so horrible, I mean, he's such a bad man.
[02:15:00.600 --> 02:15:06.200]  By the way, here's Harry Reid saying how dare people, the black helicopter people, talk
[02:15:06.200 --> 02:15:08.400]  about false flags.
[02:15:08.400 --> 02:15:10.940]  They're very upset right now, people are talking about false flags.
[02:15:10.940 --> 02:15:14.560]  They don't want you to look up a false flag, a self-inflicted wound, an inside job.
[02:15:14.560 --> 02:15:18.400]  It's a government frame up or a corporate frame up to take your rights, to say you're
[02:15:18.400 --> 02:15:20.040]  all suspects.
[02:15:20.040 --> 02:15:22.640]  Now we're gonna spawn you without warrants, which they're already doing.
[02:15:22.640 --> 02:15:26.800]  Now we're gonna have checkpoints and you're gonna pay our private contracting firms to
[02:15:26.800 --> 02:15:31.000]  have Kraft International and Blackwater and everybody else sticking their hands down your
[02:15:31.000 --> 02:15:32.560]  wife's pants.
[02:15:32.560 --> 02:15:42.280]  Cuz they're Navy SEALs, let's pay you $200,000 a piece to walk around acting tough everywhere.
[02:15:42.280 --> 02:15:50.240]  Yes, yes, the whole takeover of our society turning us into a cross of Baghdad and Israel.
[02:15:50.240 --> 02:15:55.560]  I don't wanna live in the West Bank, I'm not a suspect, I didn't do jack squat, our borders
[02:15:55.560 --> 02:15:59.040]  are wide open.
[02:15:59.040 --> 02:16:08.920]  I wanna get your take on all of this 800-259-90231, 800-259-9031, 800-259-9231.
[02:16:08.920 --> 02:16:14.120]  And good job to Michael Savage covering this and saying false flag, cuz Paul Watson heard
[02:16:14.120 --> 02:16:17.020]  it last night, he listens to it.
[02:16:17.020 --> 02:16:21.400]  And a bunch of other people are out there, and great job to Drudge Report last night
[02:16:21.400 --> 02:16:25.180]  carrying our story, absolutely great job.
[02:16:25.180 --> 02:16:27.960]  And again, we've broken this, we tend to just move on to the next thing.
[02:16:27.960 --> 02:16:33.960]  I want my whole crew, just like National News is doing, I want an article with all the SEAL
[02:16:33.960 --> 02:16:34.960]  photos in it.
[02:16:34.960 --> 02:16:42.600]  I mean, they were crawling the area, crawling the area.
[02:16:42.600 --> 02:16:45.840]  And yesterday, I immediately saw this, I said, that's a SEAL outfit.
[02:16:45.840 --> 02:16:54.440]  And then sure enough, we find they've got SEAL insignias everywhere, 800-259-9231.
[02:16:54.440 --> 02:16:57.240]  And again, the media, I know how they act, they'll say, in their force report, they'll
[02:16:57.240 --> 02:17:01.280]  go, Alex Jones, that scum said SEALs did it, of course, I never said that.
[02:17:01.280 --> 02:17:05.880]  I said they were there to just be part of the drill, it's a smokescreen where everybody,
[02:17:05.880 --> 02:17:07.860]  now it looks like they had 100 people there.
[02:17:07.860 --> 02:17:11.160]  No other bags were allowed, the cops would arrest you, make you put in your car.
[02:17:11.160 --> 02:17:14.820]  But if you were authorized, everybody bring your black bags, so there's no way to ever
[02:17:14.820 --> 02:17:16.060]  find the black bag.
[02:17:16.060 --> 02:17:20.040]  So there's so many, it's just, well, you're authorized, that's kind of your undercover
[02:17:20.040 --> 02:17:21.040]  thing.
[02:17:21.040 --> 02:17:23.000]  Have a big black backpack and you're allowed to be here.
[02:17:23.000 --> 02:17:26.160]  So that somebody can be like, well, I've got my credentials, let me just leave this right
[02:17:26.160 --> 02:17:27.160]  here next to Hillbilly.
[02:17:27.160 --> 02:17:30.880]  Hillbilly, you've done well for America, I'll be back, I'm gonna get a drink, you want one?
[02:17:30.880 --> 02:17:33.360]  Thanks for helping us out with this drill, Bob.
[02:17:33.360 --> 02:17:35.160]  You're gonna be going to prison, you idiot.
[02:17:35.160 --> 02:17:39.840]  Oh, Bob, you wanna, would you like a Sprite or a Coke, Bob?
[02:17:39.840 --> 02:17:43.560]  I'll be right back in a moment, Bob.
[02:17:43.560 --> 02:17:46.840]  Bob, why don't we sit over here by this little kid?
[02:17:46.840 --> 02:17:49.320]  Hi, son, how you doing?
[02:17:49.320 --> 02:17:55.760]  Okay, get ready, two minutes, all right, I'll be back, get that drink.
[02:17:55.760 --> 02:18:00.840]  See, you gotta watch in the videos, he's walking off, we see it, guys in the outfits, okay.
[02:18:00.840 --> 02:18:06.600]  Bob, you have a good time there with that.
[02:18:06.600 --> 02:18:10.520]  We gotta look at the Saudi who was injured and then all that they released, we gotta
[02:18:10.520 --> 02:18:12.240]  look at it all.
[02:18:12.240 --> 02:18:15.380]  But see, most of these people will be killed very, very quickly now.
[02:18:15.380 --> 02:18:18.400]  And this is like the JFK deal, it's this big, I predict they're gonna kill a bunch of the
[02:18:18.400 --> 02:18:19.400]  seals that were there.
[02:18:19.400 --> 02:18:22.360]  I predict you're gonna be dying in car wrecks, you're gonna be dying of heart attacks, you'll
[02:18:22.360 --> 02:18:25.520]  get shot at shooting ranges, you're all dead.
[02:18:25.520 --> 02:18:28.920]  So the only chance you've got is to go public right now with what you know.
[02:18:28.920 --> 02:18:33.080]  Oh, I know, I know, you're still hearing this going, well, it was a drill and it did look
[02:18:33.080 --> 02:18:34.080]  like a setup.
[02:18:34.080 --> 02:18:38.260]  And they'll come in and brief you, now, that guy's a conspiracy theorist, it does look
[02:18:38.260 --> 02:18:43.320]  like there was something going on and they, Al-Qaeda may have infiltrated, this is what
[02:18:43.320 --> 02:18:45.440]  they'll tell you, cuz I've done it before.
[02:18:45.440 --> 02:18:49.280]  The head of the FBI was telling his underlings after 9-11, well, it looks like Al-Qaeda's
[02:18:49.280 --> 02:18:52.640]  penetrated us, that's how all this happened, yeah, that's how we had prior knowledge and
[02:18:52.640 --> 02:18:55.280]  stuff and stood down, they've infiltrated.
[02:18:55.280 --> 02:19:00.280]  And they'll tell the seal guys, they'll tell you, men, we've been infiltrated and they
[02:19:00.280 --> 02:19:05.400]  used our drill as a cover for their operation, national security, now, don't talk about it.
[02:19:05.400 --> 02:19:09.480]  We're gonna send you on a trip next week, we'll put a bunch of you on a helicopter,
[02:19:09.480 --> 02:19:13.080]  so have fun getting on that helicopter.
[02:19:13.080 --> 02:19:21.480]  Hey, you signed on to be secret agent man, secret agent man, and you better get right
[02:19:21.480 --> 02:19:30.080]  with Jesus right now, too, cuz you're gonna be in a pine box on a slow train for Georgia.
[02:19:30.080 --> 02:19:36.680]  But don't worry, there'll be funerals for you, governors will come out and they'll salute
[02:19:36.680 --> 02:19:41.520]  the brave, just like Seal Team 6, you're dead, they'll be killing you now.
[02:19:41.520 --> 02:19:48.640]  Hey, you signed on to be tough guys, signed on, think about that little 8-year-old kid
[02:19:48.640 --> 02:19:56.480]  who's dead, Martin Richard, shattered, blown up by a bomb, collateral damage according
[02:19:56.480 --> 02:20:02.960]  to the New World Order to get our guns and blame the Tea Party, 800-259-9031, your phone
[02:20:02.960 --> 02:20:09.160]  calls coming up and the gun grabber clip, straight ahead, stay with us.
[02:20:09.160 --> 02:20:10.160]  Gold isn't for you?
[02:20:10.160 --> 02:20:14.100]  Ted Anderson, president of Midas Resources, one of the world's premier gold and precious
[02:20:14.100 --> 02:20:15.360]  metal investing firms.
[02:20:15.360 --> 02:20:16.360]  I get it.
[02:20:16.360 --> 02:20:20.040]  You wouldn't buy gold if you believed that the government is doing a great job, that
[02:20:20.040 --> 02:20:24.480]  the Fed will stop handing out trillions of dollars like bailout candy, that social security
[02:20:24.480 --> 02:20:25.840]  would be there for you.
[02:20:25.840 --> 02:20:27.040]  That's not what's happening.
[02:20:27.040 --> 02:20:31.880]  You might even pass on gold if the stimulus package wouldn't fuel inflation, or that the
[02:20:31.880 --> 02:20:35.480]  dollar wouldn't lose value, or that your retirement would be secure.
[02:20:35.480 --> 02:20:38.920]  If all looks rosy to you, then now is not the time to buy gold.
[02:20:38.920 --> 02:20:43.200]  For the realists, there have never been more sobering reasons to diversify with gold.
[02:20:43.200 --> 02:20:49.120]  Since 2001, the US dollar index has tanked 30% while gold has risen 300%.
[02:20:49.120 --> 02:20:52.460]  Right now, savvy investors are adding gold to their portfolios.
[02:20:52.460 --> 02:20:53.520]  You should too.
[02:20:53.520 --> 02:20:54.640]  Find out what they know.
[02:20:54.640 --> 02:21:03.800]  Call us and I'll send you 10 reasons why gold will do very well free, 800-686-2237, 800-686-2237.
[02:21:03.800 --> 02:21:07.920]  That's 800-686-2237.
[02:21:07.920 --> 02:21:10.840]  Do you suffer from low functioning adrenal or thyroid gland?
[02:21:10.840 --> 02:21:14.760]  Did you know that mercury from your dental fillings comes off your teeth both as a vapor
[02:21:14.760 --> 02:21:16.720]  and as metal particles into your body?
[02:21:16.720 --> 02:21:20.640]  Wherever mercury deposits in your body, it stops cells from functioning normally.
[02:21:20.640 --> 02:21:24.900]  Animal studies show that mercury causes kidney function to drop by 60%.
[02:21:24.900 --> 02:21:29.160]  Mercury deposited into your adrenals or thyroid will cause a corresponding drop in function.
[02:21:29.160 --> 02:21:33.220]  The number one method by which your body detoxifies itself of mercury is glutathione.
[02:21:33.220 --> 02:21:37.980]  The number one superfood that helps turn on all 75 trillion cells in your body to produce
[02:21:37.980 --> 02:21:42.240]  glutathione is non-denatured whey protein from grass-fed cows.
[02:21:42.240 --> 02:21:47.880]  After investigating most high-end whey proteins on the market, only one is the most non-denatured,
[02:21:47.880 --> 02:21:52.200]  the most active, the most complete, and in our opinion, the most powerful in what nature
[02:21:52.200 --> 02:21:54.920]  originally put into the fresh raw whey.
[02:21:54.920 --> 02:21:57.000]  It is One World Whey.
[02:21:57.000 --> 02:21:59.720]  Call 888-988-3325.
[02:21:59.720 --> 02:22:02.720]  That's 888-988-3325.
[02:22:02.720 --> 02:22:04.960]  Or visit OneWorldWhey.com.
[02:22:04.960 --> 02:22:07.880]  That's OneWorldW-H-E-Y.com.
[02:22:07.880 --> 02:22:11.960]  In the last two years alone, the U.S. has seen huge losses to our food supply.
[02:22:11.960 --> 02:22:17.160]  In 2011, storms and floods raged across the U.S., costing us $20 billion in lost crops
[02:22:17.160 --> 02:22:18.160]  alone.
[02:22:18.160 --> 02:22:21.680]  In 2012, we saw the largest drought in the country in more than 50 years.
[02:22:21.680 --> 02:22:25.540]  You may think out of sight, out of mind, and so you don't think you will be affected.
[02:22:25.540 --> 02:22:26.940]  The fact is you are.
[02:22:26.940 --> 02:22:28.100]  We all are.
[02:22:28.100 --> 02:22:30.600]  Food shortages drive prices up for everyone.
[02:22:30.600 --> 02:22:35.360]  You might not be able to control Mother Nature, but you can control your food prices by freezing
[02:22:35.360 --> 02:22:39.060]  the cost and availability of your food supply with eFoods Direct.
[02:22:39.060 --> 02:22:43.920]  Be prepared before you need it with nutrient-dense food you can store for up to 25 years.
[02:22:43.920 --> 02:22:46.280]  You can hope for the best, but hope won't feed you.
[02:22:46.280 --> 02:22:49.880]  Do what I've done and get your own supply of the best, durable foods out there from
[02:22:49.880 --> 02:22:50.880]  eFoods Direct.
[02:22:50.880 --> 02:22:56.920]  Call 800-409-5633 or visit them on the web at eFoodsDirect.com.
[02:22:56.920 --> 02:22:58.480]  And check out their spring specials.
[02:22:58.480 --> 02:23:05.040]  Again, that number is 800-409-5633 or on the web at eFoodsDirect.com.
[02:23:05.040 --> 02:23:07.760]  You can bet your life on eFoods Direct.
[02:23:07.760 --> 02:23:09.160]  Don't throw away leftovers.
[02:23:09.160 --> 02:23:13.720]  Instead, throw all your leftovers, vegetable peels, eggshells, coffee grounds, pizza crusts,
[02:23:13.720 --> 02:23:15.280]  and more into the Bokashi.
[02:23:15.280 --> 02:23:18.880]  If you love to garden and compost but don't like the hassle of turning a compost bin or
[02:23:18.880 --> 02:23:23.320]  the smell, then check out the EM Bokashi Food Waste Recycling System from Tereganics.
[02:23:23.320 --> 02:23:27.780]  Finally, a way to recycle all your food and plant waste safely and effectively and stop
[02:23:27.780 --> 02:23:29.160]  using fertilizers.
[02:23:29.160 --> 02:23:31.560]  The EM Bokashi Food Waste Recycling System.
[02:23:31.560 --> 02:23:35.880]  Rather than decomposition, the Bokashi system uses fermentation to break down waste so it
[02:23:35.880 --> 02:23:40.360]  takes less time to create nutrient-dense humus for crops or gardens with no turning and no
[02:23:40.360 --> 02:23:41.700]  obnoxious odors.
[02:23:41.700 --> 02:23:46.160]  To learn more and order your Bokashi online, visit Tereganics.com and click on the orange
[02:23:46.160 --> 02:23:47.160]  button.
[02:23:47.160 --> 02:23:55.680]  That's Tereganics.com, spelled T-E-R-A-G-A-N-I-X dot com or call 866-369-3678.
[02:23:55.680 --> 02:23:59.200]  That's 866-369-3678.
[02:23:59.200 --> 02:24:02.880]  Fill all your food wastes in about six weeks with the Bokashi Food Waste Recycling System
[02:24:02.880 --> 02:24:04.440]  from Tereganics.com.
[02:24:04.440 --> 02:24:05.440]  Tereganics.
[02:24:05.440 --> 02:24:17.040]  Life's getting better.
[02:24:17.040 --> 02:24:27.400]  And if things don't change soon, they will.
[02:24:27.400 --> 02:24:32.920]  First step was touching the moon.
[02:24:32.920 --> 02:24:36.320]  Monday through Friday, 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. Central, back weeknight, 7 o'clock.
[02:24:36.320 --> 02:24:40.000]  With Info Wars Nightly News, if you go to InfoWars.com forward slash listen, we have
[02:24:40.000 --> 02:24:43.600]  the free audio and video streams of this show that will go till 5 o'clock today.
[02:24:43.600 --> 02:24:48.160]  We'll take a two-hour break, be back at 7 o'clock with hours of coverage of the imploding
[02:24:48.160 --> 02:24:49.160]  cover-up.
[02:24:49.160 --> 02:24:52.440]  I mean, this has never before happened.
[02:24:52.440 --> 02:24:56.160]  It always goes bad for them because not everybody's in on the criminal action.
[02:24:56.160 --> 02:25:02.080]  99% aren't, so the cops see the feds involved in Oklahoma City.
[02:25:02.080 --> 02:25:05.240]  People see the underwear bomber being gotten on the plane by the US government, on and
[02:25:05.240 --> 02:25:06.240]  on and on.
[02:25:06.240 --> 02:25:09.760]  They always get quasi-caught, but they just think they can call us conspiracy theorists.
[02:25:09.760 --> 02:25:17.480]  But now you've got a Navy SEAL convention, what looks like a Green Beret retiree convention.
[02:25:17.480 --> 02:25:21.160]  And by the way, you just become a Green Beret to then get recruited into Black Ops.
[02:25:21.160 --> 02:25:25.200]  There's like five more levels above it, at least.
[02:25:25.200 --> 02:25:30.240]  There's levels above Delta Force, and the most accurate thing is in that movie No Way
[02:25:30.240 --> 02:25:31.240]  Out with Kevin Costner.
[02:25:31.240 --> 02:25:32.280]  And he goes, who are these men?
[02:25:32.280 --> 02:25:33.280]  They're following me.
[02:25:33.280 --> 02:25:36.040]  He goes, they're men formerly associated with Special Forces.
[02:25:36.040 --> 02:25:40.760]  It looks like those exact guys like crouching in doorways with big black backpacks looking
[02:25:40.760 --> 02:25:41.760]  out like they're on.
[02:25:41.760 --> 02:25:44.080]  I mean, this is so bad, folks.
[02:25:44.080 --> 02:25:45.080]  This is so bad.
[02:25:45.080 --> 02:25:47.120]  All right, I said I'd go to your phone calls.
[02:25:47.120 --> 02:25:52.240]  We'll get into all the other news in the two hours after it, and the stations are more
[02:25:52.240 --> 02:25:54.000]  than welcome to carry the nightly news.
[02:25:54.000 --> 02:25:57.480]  We have some radio stations now actually carrying the nightly news and putting in their own
[02:25:57.480 --> 02:25:58.480]  ads.
[02:25:58.480 --> 02:26:01.120]  So cable systems are picking it up and just downloading it after it airs and putting it
[02:26:01.120 --> 02:26:02.120]  in themselves.
[02:26:02.120 --> 02:26:03.680]  Soon we'll be launching on satellite.
[02:26:03.680 --> 02:26:05.960]  I'm always just so busy fighting the New World Order.
[02:26:05.960 --> 02:26:09.400]  We don't get the rest of it done, but we're getting close.
[02:26:09.400 --> 02:26:10.400]  And thanks for all your support.
[02:26:10.400 --> 02:26:11.400]  We couldn't do it without you.
[02:26:11.400 --> 02:26:12.400]  I want to go to your phone calls.
[02:26:12.400 --> 02:26:13.400]  This is a short segment.
[02:26:13.400 --> 02:26:15.320]  Got a bunch of gun grabber clips coming up.
[02:26:15.320 --> 02:26:20.160]  If you just joined me, they were gonna roll out who did it.
[02:26:20.160 --> 02:26:21.600]  We have the suspect arrested.
[02:26:21.600 --> 02:26:24.360]  We're gonna roll out who we think did it, dun, dun, dun.
[02:26:24.360 --> 02:26:27.840]  And I went dun, dun, dun, got the photos, all your people with them.
[02:26:27.840 --> 02:26:28.840]  Don't try it.
[02:26:28.840 --> 02:26:30.680]  We actually don't.
[02:26:30.680 --> 02:26:33.800]  With all their guys jumping the gun going, it's lone wolf tea party.
[02:26:33.800 --> 02:26:36.640]  Remember yesterday morning and afternoon before this happened?
[02:26:36.640 --> 02:26:38.640]  They're like, it's lone wolf.
[02:26:38.640 --> 02:26:41.080]  We told you it's white tea party.
[02:26:41.080 --> 02:26:45.220]  They don't want us to say yet, but we were right.
[02:26:45.220 --> 02:26:49.440]  It's you evil gun owner, sorry, you don't get to do that now, do you?
[02:26:49.440 --> 02:26:50.840]  Or you may go ahead with it.
[02:26:50.840 --> 02:26:52.800]  You may double down and just come out with it.
[02:26:52.800 --> 02:26:53.800]  And so what?
[02:26:53.800 --> 02:26:57.920]  You got everybody around them with the other bombs and then unexploded devices.
[02:26:57.920 --> 02:27:01.720]  Looks like you guys had a bunch of bombs planned to go off, but things didn't work out the
[02:27:01.720 --> 02:27:04.840]  way you wanted at your Navy SEAL convention.
[02:27:04.840 --> 02:27:09.160]  And again, the Navy SEALs are just there for cover in the whole confusion.
[02:27:09.160 --> 02:27:14.200]  And all the Boston cops know it like, wow, wow, mom, those are Navy SEALs.
[02:27:14.200 --> 02:27:16.160]  They can defeat King Kong.
[02:27:16.160 --> 02:27:20.120]  And sure, Navy SEALs are tough guys, strong, smart, generally.
[02:27:20.120 --> 02:27:21.320]  But they're still just men, folks.
[02:27:21.320 --> 02:27:23.960]  They kind of build this whole thing up.
[02:27:23.960 --> 02:27:26.600]  You know about these are the most incredible people on Earth.
[02:27:26.600 --> 02:27:29.360]  Really, are they incredible enough to now go public?
[02:27:29.360 --> 02:27:32.680]  That there was a drill and they were there and probably saved their lives?
[02:27:32.680 --> 02:27:35.360]  Do they have the moral courage that Pat Tillman had?
[02:27:35.360 --> 02:27:38.080]  This is right letters home going, we grow the drugs here.
[02:27:38.080 --> 02:27:39.080]  There's no real war.
[02:27:39.080 --> 02:27:40.080]  This is all a hoax.
[02:27:40.080 --> 02:27:41.640]  The government runs the Taliban.
[02:27:41.640 --> 02:27:45.920]  You're dead, Pat Tillman, boom.
[02:27:45.920 --> 02:27:50.560]  You got the courage of Pat Tillman, who I admire, because he had real moral courage?
[02:27:50.560 --> 02:27:55.920]  Are you gonna just play along whatever narrative they feed you Navy SEALs?
[02:27:55.920 --> 02:27:58.040]  And I'm serious, a lot of you are gonna have accidents.
[02:27:58.040 --> 02:28:00.320]  I know how the globalists operate, they will.
[02:28:00.320 --> 02:28:03.960]  I would say most of the team involved in this, you're dead.
[02:28:03.960 --> 02:28:07.540]  Just like I told Private Lynch, I said they've already killed four members of your unit that
[02:28:07.540 --> 02:28:11.240]  spoke out and say that you were a coward and hid and weren't involved in the fighting.
[02:28:11.240 --> 02:28:14.360]  And then hid when Jerry Bruckheimer produced the rescue at the hospital.
[02:28:14.360 --> 02:28:18.920]  Yeah, Jerry Bruckheimer produced it over sat phone and sat video when they went in.
[02:28:18.920 --> 02:28:22.360]  That came out in the BBC.
[02:28:22.360 --> 02:28:26.980]  And I said, you better go Public Lynch or they're gonna kill you and go our dead patriot
[02:28:26.980 --> 02:28:27.980]  Private Lynch.
[02:28:27.980 --> 02:28:28.980]  And she came out the next day.
[02:28:28.980 --> 02:28:31.840]  I don't know if she got my message or somebody else told her and said, it's all fake.
[02:28:31.840 --> 02:28:32.840]  They told me to lie.
[02:28:32.840 --> 02:28:33.840]  I wasn't a hero.
[02:28:33.840 --> 02:28:34.840]  I apologize.
[02:28:34.840 --> 02:28:40.280]  It was the men in the resupply thing that fought off the Iraqis and then got overrun
[02:28:40.280 --> 02:28:41.280]  and they took us to the hospital.
[02:28:41.280 --> 02:28:43.600]  And I hid the whole time and I'm sorry.
[02:28:43.600 --> 02:28:47.800]  This is propaganda to get women in the military and they didn't have to kill her then cuz
[02:28:47.800 --> 02:28:48.800]  she was missing.
[02:28:48.800 --> 02:28:53.520]  They killed Pat Tillman and said he died charging the machine gun nest, battling Al-Qaeda.
[02:28:53.520 --> 02:28:56.440]  And then the army coroner wouldn't lie and said, no, it's homicide.
[02:28:56.440 --> 02:28:57.440]  They killed him.
[02:28:57.440 --> 02:28:59.080]  They first shot him at a distance.
[02:28:59.080 --> 02:29:01.280]  He begged behind the rock and said, I'm friendly.
[02:29:01.280 --> 02:29:02.280]  I'm friendly.
[02:29:02.280 --> 02:29:03.280]  He got back up.
[02:29:03.280 --> 02:29:04.280]  They shot him again.
[02:29:04.280 --> 02:29:09.080]  And then they got up there and triple tapped him at about five feet away with an M16.
[02:29:09.080 --> 02:29:13.440]  They shot him across the frontal lobe, bullets going, three bullets going into the cerebral
[02:29:13.440 --> 02:29:19.160]  cortex as he flopped around on the ground with wounds all over his body, saying, I'm
[02:29:19.160 --> 02:29:20.160]  friendly.
[02:29:20.160 --> 02:29:21.160]  I'm friendly.
[02:29:21.160 --> 02:29:22.680]  Oh, they knew you were friendly, buddy.
[02:29:22.680 --> 02:29:25.960]  They knew how friendly you are to America and they murdered you.
[02:29:25.960 --> 02:29:28.320]  Oh, but I'm supposed to not talk about that.
[02:29:28.320 --> 02:29:32.400]  I'm supposed to be a big schmuck, a big chump, a big cowardly fool.
[02:29:32.400 --> 02:29:38.740]  No, I have sworn on the altar of God, eternal resistance against every form of tyranny over
[02:29:38.740 --> 02:29:40.440]  the mind of men.
[02:29:40.440 --> 02:29:45.240]  And I'm going into the black hole in, through and beyond ramming speed.
[02:29:45.240 --> 02:29:50.600]  I am splitting the accelerator all the way down, pedal to the metal, slamming it down
[02:29:50.600 --> 02:29:57.680]  and I'm chaining myself to this craft, going straight into the enemy forward.
[02:29:57.680 --> 02:29:58.980]  We're on the march.
[02:29:58.980 --> 02:30:01.360]  The empire's on the run.
[02:30:01.360 --> 02:30:08.720]  Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[02:30:08.720 --> 02:30:12.120]  You prepare by purchasing gold, food, and firearms.
[02:30:12.120 --> 02:30:16.080]  But if you don't have a home security system, then you're missing a critical weapon in your
[02:30:16.080 --> 02:30:19.880]  arsenal for home protection when you're sleeping or away from home.
[02:30:19.880 --> 02:30:21.920]  Who's watching out for intruders.
[02:30:21.920 --> 02:30:23.600]  Check out simply safe.
[02:30:23.600 --> 02:30:28.040]  It's a new do it yourself home security system that is completely wireless.

[02:30:51.840 --> 02:30:54.220]  need to let a stranger into your home.

[02:31:08.360 --> 02:31:12.440]  In the last two years alone, the U.S. has seen huge losses to our food supply.
[02:31:12.440 --> 02:31:17.680]  In 2011, storms and floods raged across the U.S., costing us 20 billion in lost crops
[02:31:17.680 --> 02:31:18.680]  alone.
[02:31:18.680 --> 02:31:22.240]  In 2012, we saw the largest drought in the country in more than 50 years.
[02:31:22.240 --> 02:31:26.140]  You may think out of sight, out of mind, and so you don't think you will be affected.
[02:31:26.140 --> 02:31:27.560]  The fact is you are.
[02:31:27.560 --> 02:31:28.720]  We all are.
[02:31:28.720 --> 02:31:30.880]  Food shortages drive prices up for everyone.
[02:31:30.880 --> 02:31:35.960]  You might not be able to control Mother Nature, but you can control your food prices by freezing
[02:31:35.960 --> 02:31:39.720]  the cost and availability of your food supply with eFoods Direct.

[02:32:08.560 --> 02:32:09.680]  I had tried everything.
[02:32:09.680 --> 02:32:12.040]  I'd cut back the amount of food I was eating.
[02:32:12.040 --> 02:32:15.240]  I was lifting weights and jogging, but nothing was working.
[02:32:15.240 --> 02:32:19.680]  My body was literally starving for minerals and trace elements as well as key vitamins.
[02:32:19.680 --> 02:32:25.600]  And as soon as I had that, I immediately could eat half of what I was eating previously and
[02:32:25.600 --> 02:32:26.600]  be satisfied.
[02:32:26.600 --> 02:32:30.960]  Now, there are hundreds of great products at InfowarsTeam.com, but I want to point out
[02:32:30.960 --> 02:32:38.560]  the three that have helped me lose 37 pounds in just two months.
[02:32:38.560 --> 02:32:42.200]  Products like Beyond Tangy Tangerine, Holland Burst, and Rebound.
[02:32:42.200 --> 02:32:46.480]  When I started taking the Tangy Tangerine and other products every day, I lost more
[02:32:46.480 --> 02:32:48.920]  than 37 pounds in just two months.
[02:32:48.920 --> 02:32:50.320]  Now that's results.
[02:32:50.320 --> 02:32:56.080]  I want to challenge my listeners to go to InfowarsTeam.com and to order just three of
[02:32:56.080 --> 02:32:57.080]  their products.
[02:32:57.080 --> 02:33:03.160]  And you will see the changes in the way you look, feel, and in your appetite almost immediately.
[02:33:03.160 --> 02:33:10.800]  Start your journey to health and wellness today, InfowarsTeam.com.
[02:33:10.800 --> 02:33:18.080]  I have sworn upon the altar of God, eternal hostility against every form of tyranny over
[02:33:18.080 --> 02:33:20.440]  the mind of man.
[02:33:20.440 --> 02:33:22.160]  Thomas Jefferson.
[02:33:22.160 --> 02:33:28.560]  That's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:33:28.560 --> 02:33:30.520]  Join me in defeating tyranny.
[02:33:30.520 --> 02:33:32.920]  Throw fear to the wind.
[02:33:32.920 --> 02:33:38.620]  Realize the only way through this is to realize the enemy operations and to grow up and face
[02:33:38.620 --> 02:33:42.920]  the monsters that lurk and inhabit our government and major corporations.
[02:33:42.920 --> 02:33:47.080]  The only way to be free is to be free and stand as free men and women have done throughout
[02:33:47.080 --> 02:33:51.640]  history and declare your independence.
[02:33:51.640 --> 02:33:55.440]  Declare your independence at a spiritual subatomic level.
[02:33:55.440 --> 02:34:00.320]  Declare your independence in your soul, in your will, in your intellect.
[02:34:00.320 --> 02:34:04.280]  And then that will will work its will upon the world.
[02:34:04.280 --> 02:34:07.960]  Being free is a decision.
[02:34:07.960 --> 02:34:13.640]  That's all you have to do is commit to truth and ask God to open your heart, open your
[02:34:13.640 --> 02:34:17.340]  mind and to use you as a vessel against evil.
[02:34:17.340 --> 02:34:24.040]  Say that prayer and turn yourself fully over to life and the Holy Spirit and the universe
[02:34:24.040 --> 02:34:29.640]  will open up and the living water of Jesus Christ will flow straight out of the time
[02:34:29.640 --> 02:34:34.000]  space continuum and you will truly be free.
[02:34:34.000 --> 02:34:38.040]  All right, I want to go to your calls or I'll never get to them.
[02:34:38.040 --> 02:34:43.880]  We're doing two hours at least, maybe three hours of overdrive after this show today.
[02:34:43.880 --> 02:34:48.440]  It'll be audio video streams at info wars dot com forward slash listen and also find
[02:34:48.440 --> 02:34:53.240]  the streams at prison planet dot com prison planet dot TV.
[02:34:53.240 --> 02:34:54.240]  And I get wound up here.
[02:34:54.240 --> 02:34:57.000]  I mean, I get right down to the guts, right down to who I am.
[02:34:57.000 --> 02:34:58.000]  It sounds wild.
[02:34:58.000 --> 02:35:00.260]  It sounds like, you know, a movie of what?
[02:35:00.260 --> 02:35:04.040]  But those are based on how people really act when they've committed to something.
[02:35:04.040 --> 02:35:09.100]  When you fully know the danger and just commit to it and go through it, it's it's it's it's
[02:35:09.100 --> 02:35:11.980]  a spiritual decision.
[02:35:11.980 --> 02:35:14.080]  And I want to know the whole truth, nothing but the truth.
[02:35:14.080 --> 02:35:15.360]  So help me, God.
[02:35:15.360 --> 02:35:18.080]  And I want to be strong in the face of the tyrants.
[02:35:18.080 --> 02:35:22.480]  I want to defend little eight year old boys like Martin Richard, who they're using for
[02:35:22.480 --> 02:35:26.880]  their tyranny and and watching Americans be so sentimental and crying and the goodness
[02:35:26.880 --> 02:35:29.700]  and hey, we're going to have courage and all this.
[02:35:29.700 --> 02:35:32.960]  But it's only so they can take our sentimentality and say you're going to have courage with
[02:35:32.960 --> 02:35:33.960]  the army.
[02:35:33.960 --> 02:35:37.560]  Check in your check in your I.D. now and you walk down the street, you're going to have
[02:35:37.560 --> 02:35:39.640]  courage when we take your bank account without a warrant.
[02:35:39.640 --> 02:35:43.280]  You're going to have courage when we arrest gun owners for 10 round mags are up.
[02:35:43.280 --> 02:35:46.280]  You're going to have to see it's all about and the government's the big papa.
[02:35:46.280 --> 02:35:49.040]  Oh, you did good when the bombing happened.
[02:35:49.040 --> 02:35:53.160]  You know, the patriotism, the patriotism, you mean for the New World Order?
[02:35:53.160 --> 02:35:56.240]  That's not the patriotism.
[02:35:56.240 --> 02:36:01.060]  They are preying on you and it's cynical, it's disgusting and it's horrible to admit
[02:36:01.060 --> 02:36:02.060]  to yourself.
[02:36:02.060 --> 02:36:03.800]  I know it is.
[02:36:03.800 --> 02:36:09.560]  But I have never had anything but success against these people when I would expose.
[02:36:09.560 --> 02:36:13.160]  Three thousand, two thousand dollar a day fines on old people taking their houses for
[02:36:13.160 --> 02:36:14.960]  three inch grass.
[02:36:14.960 --> 02:36:19.360]  It would it would stop them when I would fight for people with a CPS going after their kids.
[02:36:19.360 --> 02:36:20.360]  We would stop them.
[02:36:20.360 --> 02:36:22.080]  But I couldn't do all the cases.
[02:36:22.080 --> 02:36:23.080]  I couldn't help.
[02:36:23.080 --> 02:36:24.080]  I'd help one.
[02:36:24.080 --> 02:36:28.360]  And then hundreds would come and I was like other people, you need to help them.
[02:36:28.360 --> 02:36:32.160]  And then I have to triage this.
[02:36:32.160 --> 02:36:36.040]  Triage is where I had to turn it off and just go, I can't you know, the hundreds of families
[02:36:36.040 --> 02:36:39.480]  a day having their kids taken in most cases for absolutely no reason.
[02:36:39.480 --> 02:36:43.080]  I have to just sit there and go, well, I'll work till 10 tonight.
[02:36:43.080 --> 02:36:47.400]  I'll do another video on vaccines killing people when I read about the vaccines killing
[02:36:47.400 --> 02:36:48.400]  people.
[02:36:48.400 --> 02:36:49.400]  I'll do another.
[02:36:49.400 --> 02:36:52.120]  You know, like when I'm totally tired, got a headache, exhausted, I will literally go
[02:36:52.120 --> 02:36:57.000]  in my office and just get down on my knees and say, God, give me energy, give me strength
[02:36:57.000 --> 02:36:59.120]  to fight.
[02:36:59.120 --> 02:37:02.320]  And then and then my subconscious, the devil and everyone to call comes is all looking
[02:37:02.320 --> 02:37:03.320]  at a bad job.
[02:37:03.320 --> 02:37:04.320]  Look how obnoxious you are.
[02:37:04.320 --> 02:37:05.320]  It doesn't matter.
[02:37:05.320 --> 02:37:06.320]  My heart's right.
[02:37:06.320 --> 02:37:08.320]  I'm doing the best job I can.
[02:37:08.320 --> 02:37:12.360]  And I'm telling you, ladies and gentlemen, if you're not on your knees at least once
[02:37:12.360 --> 02:37:14.600]  a day.
[02:37:14.600 --> 02:37:18.920]  Really trying to get close to God in times like these or something wrong with you.
[02:37:18.920 --> 02:37:22.520]  And you can knock God all day, but notice as God has gotten out of our lives and as
[02:37:22.520 --> 02:37:25.980]  Christ has gotten out of our lives, look at what America is turning into.
[02:37:25.980 --> 02:37:27.220]  Just look at it.
[02:37:27.220 --> 02:37:28.220]  Just look at it.
[02:37:28.220 --> 02:37:29.220]  Just look.
[02:37:29.220 --> 02:37:32.000]  And I don't point to corrupt churches and say, oh, you want me to go to that?
[02:37:32.000 --> 02:37:33.660]  No, that's part of the problem.
[02:37:33.660 --> 02:37:37.080]  That's all Christ talked about was corrupt churches of his day.
[02:37:37.080 --> 02:37:43.120]  And then Paul, the fake Christian churches, the Pharisees in there.
[02:37:43.120 --> 02:37:48.960]  But it's the reality that that that that people have become willfully evil, willfully arrogant
[02:37:48.960 --> 02:37:50.680]  or like, I don't care what's happening.
[02:37:50.680 --> 02:37:52.280]  All I want to do is go have a good time.
[02:37:52.280 --> 02:37:55.240]  But when you're like that, having the good time isn't fun.
[02:37:55.240 --> 02:38:02.560]  I mean, so many men using this as an analogy that have never really had success with women.
[02:38:02.560 --> 02:38:06.360]  They once they do later in life, run around crazy with all these sexual partners, all
[02:38:06.360 --> 02:38:08.360]  this stuff because they were never fulfilled.
[02:38:08.360 --> 02:38:14.200]  But when it's just empty, sex stops even being good if there's not that love there.
[02:38:14.200 --> 02:38:18.580]  And there's not that real connection, both people just get emptied out, it's not even
[02:38:18.580 --> 02:38:19.580]  real anymore.
[02:38:19.580 --> 02:38:27.380]  So people do wilder and wilder things trying to find the what so many decadent people just
[02:38:27.380 --> 02:38:32.000]  get more and more decadent and more and more empty, whereas if you love somebody, it just
[02:38:32.000 --> 02:38:33.600]  gets better and better.
[02:38:33.600 --> 02:38:35.960]  It's the same thing.
[02:38:35.960 --> 02:38:38.520]  Evil is not going to fulfill you.
[02:38:38.520 --> 02:38:41.920]  The people involved in this bombing, you're not fulfilled.
[02:38:41.920 --> 02:38:43.920]  Most of you are turned over to evil completely.
[02:38:43.920 --> 02:38:46.200]  You're on a power trip that you're in on the big secret.
[02:38:46.200 --> 02:38:48.760]  Let me tell you, you're not in on a lot of it.
[02:38:48.760 --> 02:38:51.120]  I'm in on all of it because I've studied history.
[02:38:51.120 --> 02:38:52.400]  I'm in on all of it.
[02:38:52.400 --> 02:38:58.640]  I can decompart mentalize their entire operation because I've studied it with a serious mind.
[02:38:58.640 --> 02:39:02.200]  And let me tell you, this thing is a man eating bear trap.
[02:39:02.200 --> 02:39:03.900]  You don't want to be part of.
[02:39:03.900 --> 02:39:04.900]  Let's go to these calls.
[02:39:04.900 --> 02:39:05.900]  I apologize.
[02:39:05.900 --> 02:39:07.480]  This is Rick in Virginia.
[02:39:07.480 --> 02:39:09.160]  You're on the air, Rick.
[02:39:09.160 --> 02:39:10.600]  What's your take on all this?
[02:39:10.600 --> 02:39:17.640]  Yeah, well, I found a news article from the New York magazine claiming that there's going
[02:39:17.640 --> 02:39:21.060]  to be pictures of the two suspects coming out today.
[02:39:21.060 --> 02:39:28.440]  But within this news article, it's not claiming that the two suspects have gone viral in all
[02:39:28.440 --> 02:39:29.440]  these pictures.
[02:39:29.440 --> 02:39:34.240]  It's going to be two other suspects and these two suspects in the pictures have gone viral.
[02:39:34.240 --> 02:39:43.000]  The guy in the blue jacket is actually a teenage kid who's running on his school's track team.
[02:39:43.000 --> 02:39:48.080]  And the guy in his white hat and black backpack is actually his track coach.
[02:39:48.080 --> 02:39:49.600]  Just wanted your thoughts on that.
[02:39:49.600 --> 02:39:53.080]  Now I've said over and over again, they'll come out with cover stories and they'll put
[02:39:53.080 --> 02:39:59.080]  forward a distraction away from the original redneck patsies that they were going to roll
[02:39:59.080 --> 02:40:00.080]  out.
[02:40:00.080 --> 02:40:01.080]  They're going to have cover stories.
[02:40:01.080 --> 02:40:03.360]  They're going to try to spin this.
[02:40:03.360 --> 02:40:08.000]  But my whole point is we put out all the suspicious groups with the backpacks and they've chosen
[02:40:08.000 --> 02:40:10.000]  to go with this.
[02:40:10.000 --> 02:40:12.200]  You understand?
[02:40:12.200 --> 02:40:17.040]  Send me that article, send me that article.
[02:40:17.040 --> 02:40:19.240]  What's the headline on that article?
[02:40:19.240 --> 02:40:29.280]  It is images of Boston suspects, not the guys on the post front page will be released today.
[02:40:29.280 --> 02:40:34.920]  It is images of suspects, not the guys on the post front page will be released today.
[02:40:34.920 --> 02:40:36.560]  And let's scroll down to it.
[02:40:36.560 --> 02:40:38.480]  Let's scroll down to the images they're talking about.
[02:40:38.480 --> 02:40:39.480]  Yeah, there you go.
[02:40:39.480 --> 02:40:41.440]  Spin machine and high drive.
[02:40:41.440 --> 02:40:46.480]  Why don't they release all the Navy Seal photos, the redneck photos, the guys crouching in
[02:40:46.480 --> 02:40:47.920]  doorways with bags?
[02:40:47.920 --> 02:40:49.420]  They're saying there was no drill.
[02:40:49.420 --> 02:40:53.040]  When it's clear, they were having a giant drill right there.
[02:40:53.040 --> 02:40:57.360]  So we will continue to follow with all of that.
[02:40:57.360 --> 02:41:01.120]  Now if you look at that guy with the bag, the black bag with the silver stripe, that's
[02:41:01.120 --> 02:41:03.840]  what matches what the FBI is saying what's left.
[02:41:03.840 --> 02:41:08.600]  And I believe that's who they claim they were gonna arrest and that that's their patsy.
[02:41:08.600 --> 02:41:13.960]  Now who knows what they'll try now, but again, the big story here is that they're swarming
[02:41:13.960 --> 02:41:20.400]  drill going on with special forces, what looks like Army and Navy everywhere.
[02:41:20.400 --> 02:41:24.640]  I mean literally by the flags where this happened and they've denied the drill when they were
[02:41:24.640 --> 02:41:25.880]  announcing the drill.
[02:41:25.880 --> 02:41:28.400]  And they've tried to grab all the victims and keep them quiet.
[02:41:28.400 --> 02:41:31.560]  So again, we know there was a major drill going on.
[02:41:31.560 --> 02:41:33.960]  And we know they said that they had already arrested the guy.
[02:41:33.960 --> 02:41:37.280]  Why is it their investigation now that they didn't have the press conference?
[02:41:37.280 --> 02:41:41.280]  You see what I'm saying?
[02:41:41.280 --> 02:41:43.080]  Yeah.
[02:41:43.080 --> 02:41:46.400]  And again, why are they trying to divert, and again, there's other Saudis that they've
[02:41:46.400 --> 02:41:49.080]  arrested and then released or gone to their houses.
[02:41:49.080 --> 02:41:51.720]  And then you've got meeting with the Saudi ambassador out of the blue.
[02:41:51.720 --> 02:41:56.920]  And again, they do it cuz they know the simple minds can't understand what's going on with
[02:41:56.920 --> 02:41:58.640]  all this.
[02:41:58.640 --> 02:42:02.260]  But my point is we were the first to release all these photos in the media.
[02:42:02.260 --> 02:42:06.720]  Have you noticed none of the media now, yesterday kept their mouth shut, didn't run with this
[02:42:06.720 --> 02:42:11.000]  even when it was on Drudge and then only showed the photos, even though they've been showing
[02:42:11.000 --> 02:42:14.680]  a guy on the roof until the FBI said it was okay.
[02:42:14.680 --> 02:42:18.840]  Does that show how controlled they are?
[02:42:18.840 --> 02:42:24.000]  I'm not saying that I don't believe anything, I just want to hear-
[02:42:24.000 --> 02:42:25.680]  No, no, Rick, Rick, I want your take on it.
[02:42:25.680 --> 02:42:26.680]  I want to hear what you have to say.
[02:42:26.680 --> 02:42:27.680]  You don't have to agree with me.
[02:42:27.680 --> 02:42:29.560]  I'm saying, do you see what I'm saying?
[02:42:29.560 --> 02:42:31.680]  The big story is the cover up of the drill.
[02:42:31.680 --> 02:42:33.680]  I appreciate your call.
[02:42:33.680 --> 02:42:35.000]  Let's talk to Chad in Kentucky.
[02:42:35.000 --> 02:42:36.000]  Chad, you're on the air.
[02:42:36.000 --> 02:42:37.000]  Go ahead.
[02:42:37.000 --> 02:42:43.540]  Yeah, I was watching a live leak from a local Boston channel reporting on what was going
[02:42:43.540 --> 02:42:45.120]  on at the courthouse.
[02:42:45.120 --> 02:42:49.240]  They had a helicopter footage and it literally looked like you were watching a movie.
[02:42:49.240 --> 02:42:54.880]  They had military outside the courthouse with AR-15s protecting it while they kicked everyone
[02:42:54.880 --> 02:42:56.640]  out of the courthouse.
[02:42:56.640 --> 02:43:01.520]  Then they showed this van with tinted windows with the military person hanging off the side,
[02:43:01.520 --> 02:43:07.580]  go zoom up the street, back into the courthouse, and it looked like they basically took someone
[02:43:07.580 --> 02:43:08.580]  out and-
[02:43:08.580 --> 02:43:11.320]  Yeah, do me a favor, find that video and send it.
[02:43:11.320 --> 02:43:15.080]  I actually saw some of that walking by, I think it was CNN during a break, but you get
[02:43:15.080 --> 02:43:16.800]  dangy when you're on the air this much.
[02:43:16.800 --> 02:43:18.040]  That's what I'm saying.
[02:43:18.040 --> 02:43:20.440]  That's the courthouse where they were saying they were gonna have the press conference
[02:43:20.440 --> 02:43:22.200]  in front of it.
[02:43:22.200 --> 02:43:25.440]  And then they sent another location and then they run in exactly, they wanted to get the
[02:43:25.440 --> 02:43:27.260]  media out to get rid.
[02:43:27.260 --> 02:43:31.400]  They said, we've arrested, we have the suspect, and then here comes the black van to get them
[02:43:31.400 --> 02:43:34.520]  out of there to sleep with the fishes or whatever happened to them.
[02:43:34.520 --> 02:43:37.040]  So yes, what was that Boston station?
[02:43:37.040 --> 02:43:38.680]  Boston helicopter?
[02:43:38.680 --> 02:43:43.160]  It was wcvb.com, the Boston channel.
[02:43:43.160 --> 02:43:46.240]  I sent it to Rob Dew's email.
[02:43:46.240 --> 02:43:48.760]  What time did you send that?
[02:43:48.760 --> 02:43:50.400]  Probably about an hour ago.
[02:43:50.400 --> 02:43:55.380]  All right, guys, go tell Dew we're calling, because I know the building's big, just keep
[02:43:55.380 --> 02:43:57.440]  like getting the space next to us and next to us.
[02:43:57.440 --> 02:43:59.600]  We have the whole building is like an aircraft carrier.
[02:43:59.600 --> 02:44:02.080]  We got room to grow here.
[02:44:02.080 --> 02:44:07.200]  But thank you, gosh, I should have been going to more of your calls, absolutely.
[02:44:07.200 --> 02:44:12.440]  That was the way, in my opinion, the most likely thing, that's what I do is approximations.
[02:44:12.440 --> 02:44:16.000]  The most likely thing is, cuz they said, we have him, we're gonna have a press conference,
[02:44:16.000 --> 02:44:17.000]  we got the guy.
[02:44:17.000 --> 02:44:18.000]  We got him, yay!
[02:44:18.000 --> 02:44:22.480]  And that's like, no, no, we don't, no, we don't, because they've decided to go with
[02:44:22.480 --> 02:44:23.840]  some other plan.
[02:44:23.840 --> 02:44:27.600]  To then take all the guys with the backpacks, pick the ones that maybe aren't involved or
[02:44:27.600 --> 02:44:31.560]  are Middle Eastern that are a rabbit trail or maybe are, they cover it up, and then they
[02:44:31.560 --> 02:44:32.560]  get rid of it.
[02:44:32.560 --> 02:44:37.080]  But the media had already jumped the gun and said, it's lone wolf, not foreign, it's right
[02:44:37.080 --> 02:44:38.080]  wingers.
[02:44:38.080 --> 02:44:41.440]  They had already jumped the gun because they wanted to be first, and they've all got White
[02:44:41.440 --> 02:44:43.200]  House connections, MSNBC and others.
[02:44:43.200 --> 02:44:46.560]  I mean, do you see how big that is, or do you have other points you'd like to add?
[02:44:46.560 --> 02:44:48.840]  No, I definitely see how big it is.
[02:44:48.840 --> 02:44:52.520]  I think they were probably gonna roll out the white right wing guy, probably the guy
[02:44:52.520 --> 02:44:54.480]  in the blue robe that was holding that backpack.
[02:44:54.480 --> 02:44:59.240]  But then as soon as we got all the videos and photos out, they couldn't do it.
[02:44:59.240 --> 02:45:03.480]  Yeah, so maybe they'll get some other schizophrenic or something, they'll probably electro shocking
[02:45:03.480 --> 02:45:05.800]  somebody right now where they won't know what they are for a month.
[02:45:05.800 --> 02:45:09.880]  And you turn it up on hot and then they'll roll him out drooling or who knows?
[02:45:09.880 --> 02:45:12.200]  I mean, who knows?
[02:45:12.200 --> 02:45:16.280]  Or they may be torturing the guy, get him to confess or before they roll him out.
[02:45:16.280 --> 02:45:17.280]  I have no idea.
[02:45:17.280 --> 02:45:22.520]  I mean, I just know McVeigh was assigned the second most famous mind control doctor in
[02:45:22.520 --> 02:45:29.600]  US history, Jolyon West, the protege of the CIA director of MK Ultra, Dr. Ewan Cameron,
[02:45:29.600 --> 02:45:31.720]  and that's History Channel documentaries.
[02:45:31.720 --> 02:45:35.400]  But and then they're like, never mind, the top mind control doctor is McVeigh's doctor.
[02:45:35.400 --> 02:45:38.160]  And then McVeigh would get off the drugs and tell people in jail cells next to him, I'm
[02:45:38.160 --> 02:45:39.160]  under mind control.
[02:45:39.160 --> 02:45:40.320]  I'm Army Special Forces.
[02:45:40.320 --> 02:45:41.320]  They set me up.
[02:45:41.320 --> 02:45:43.880]  And then Nichols signed an affidavit saying that.
[02:45:43.880 --> 02:45:48.240]  Plus, that's what all the cops I talked to in Oklahoma City said.
[02:45:48.240 --> 02:45:53.080]  McVeigh was totally set up and I've been telling people last week, I said Monday before this
[02:45:53.080 --> 02:45:56.120]  even happened, because the show led into it.
[02:45:56.120 --> 02:45:59.200]  I remember saying, people can look this up, I remember saying, look, if you're in the
[02:45:59.200 --> 02:46:03.080]  military or police, don't be part of these drills, cuz one out of 100, they're gonna
[02:46:03.080 --> 02:46:04.080]  blow you up.
[02:46:04.080 --> 02:46:06.840]  Man, you can't be any more on target than that.
[02:46:06.840 --> 02:46:10.060]  So yeah, we'll see what happens, and absolutely.
[02:46:10.060 --> 02:46:12.520]  That's why I said they were gonna go with the rednecks, but they went with the Saudis,
[02:46:12.520 --> 02:46:16.000]  whether they're real or not, as a divert.
[02:46:16.000 --> 02:46:21.440]  And then they probably had other backup rednecks in the area too that aren't in the photo,
[02:46:21.440 --> 02:46:22.440]  but they're scared.
[02:46:22.440 --> 02:46:26.760]  They're going over all the photos to see if we've got photos of the rednecks next to their
[02:46:26.760 --> 02:46:27.760]  handlers.
[02:46:27.760 --> 02:46:30.720]  And again, I wouldn't wanna be those rednecks right now.
[02:46:30.720 --> 02:46:35.160]  Poor guys, they were like, be part of a special program to help America.
[02:46:35.160 --> 02:46:39.840]  And we wanna be part of a drill, just like 7-7 with those Arabs, I wanna help America.
[02:46:39.840 --> 02:46:42.440]  Good Billy, you're gonna help them now, are you ready?
[02:46:42.440 --> 02:46:43.640]  I mean, it's just so sick.
[02:46:43.640 --> 02:46:46.040]  All right, thank you, God bless you.
[02:46:46.040 --> 02:46:48.400]  Let's go to Matt in Alabama, you're on the air.
[02:46:48.400 --> 02:46:50.560]  How are you doing today?
[02:46:50.560 --> 02:46:51.560]  Pretty good.
[02:46:51.560 --> 02:46:56.160]  I just wanna say thank you so much for breaking the news yesterday.
[02:46:56.160 --> 02:46:59.480]  And I was trying to post it as quick as you were breaking it on Facebook, and they were
[02:46:59.480 --> 02:47:02.240]  editing and taking it away as quick as I was-
[02:47:02.240 --> 02:47:06.440]  Oh, yeah, Facebook is a pump and dump scam by the Bilderbergs, he officially intends
[02:47:06.440 --> 02:47:08.080]  it, he calls us dumb efforts.
[02:47:08.080 --> 02:47:11.320]  We use it just to expose them, but yeah, they censor everything.
[02:47:11.320 --> 02:47:14.640]  People try to do articles about Benghazi cover up, they'll shut down your account.
[02:47:14.640 --> 02:47:17.360]  I mean, Facebook is a stinking joke.
[02:47:17.360 --> 02:47:18.360]  Go ahead.
[02:47:18.360 --> 02:47:23.800]  I know, and I'm part of the military and I'm a veteran, a surgeon of brains and also trained
[02:47:23.800 --> 02:47:24.800]  as a police officer.
[02:47:24.800 --> 02:47:31.000]  So this thing stinks to high heaven, and what we need to do is troll Facebook to see if
[02:47:31.000 --> 02:47:36.880]  we can find names to faces that you have posted on the pictures to see if maybe we might be
[02:47:36.880 --> 02:47:39.120]  able to find somebody who-
[02:47:39.120 --> 02:47:42.760]  Yeah, yeah, that's what Ja'Kari Jackson, we'll call it a two hour investigation, I'll let
[02:47:42.760 --> 02:47:46.360]  them cover some other news and then for like 20 minutes on SOPA and a bunch of other stuff
[02:47:46.360 --> 02:47:51.760]  at the end, I want the guys to open the phones up and just take your humet intelligence and
[02:47:51.760 --> 02:47:54.080]  tips from callers because it's been you.
[02:47:54.080 --> 02:47:57.160]  It's the listeners that are doing this and I should have been taking more calls, I just
[02:47:57.160 --> 02:48:00.120]  get so wound up and caught up in my own analysis.
[02:48:00.120 --> 02:48:06.680]  But why do you, as a Marine and a guy that trains police, what signs are you seeing?
[02:48:06.680 --> 02:48:09.960]  What do you see as the biggest smoking gun, all these special forces at the end of the
[02:48:09.960 --> 02:48:10.960]  race?
[02:48:10.960 --> 02:48:12.960]  Yeah, that's correct.
[02:48:12.960 --> 02:48:19.640]  I think the focus was on the Newtown kids, so we need to figure out if they were parents
[02:48:19.640 --> 02:48:25.360]  against gun control, parents with gun control to see if, because I think they could have
[02:48:25.360 --> 02:48:30.680]  exploited that as well, that they really didn't because of the breaking news you broke.
[02:48:30.680 --> 02:48:34.100]  Oh yeah, I mean there's no doubt they're going to try to say it's probably gunpowder out
[02:48:34.100 --> 02:48:37.880]  of reloading so we can't have gunpowder.
[02:48:37.880 --> 02:48:41.680]  And I just want to make one more quick statement so that you can get to other callers.
[02:48:41.680 --> 02:48:42.680]  Yeah, go ahead.
[02:48:42.680 --> 02:48:48.080]  I liked it when we had Kordoran from Smashing Pumpkins on there, now I think to get him
[02:48:48.080 --> 02:48:55.060]  on there to get him to do a piece on it, to expose on a different angle like he was saying
[02:48:55.060 --> 02:49:01.100]  during a couple weeks ago with his other interview, I think that would be able to bring other
[02:49:01.100 --> 02:49:03.440]  audience to you.
[02:49:03.440 --> 02:49:04.440]  I agree.
[02:49:04.440 --> 02:49:06.960]  Listen, I want to explain something, God bless you sir.
[02:49:06.960 --> 02:49:09.080]  I'm not even trying to get an audience.
[02:49:09.080 --> 02:49:13.280]  I'll be honest, if we were to defeat the current globalist and turn back the tide and everything,
[02:49:13.280 --> 02:49:18.520]  I'd come in here three hours a day to the radio show and promote homeschooling or something.
[02:49:18.520 --> 02:49:23.880]  I mean, I'll be honest, I'd like nothing better, this new earpiece is so painful, man, I got
[02:49:23.880 --> 02:49:28.560]  a new earpiece, it hurts like a torture device in my ear compared to those other ones.
[02:49:28.560 --> 02:49:32.000]  Maybe put a new tip on here, the old style tip in here, so I keep pulling it in out of
[02:49:32.000 --> 02:49:38.560]  my ear for TV viewers.
[02:49:38.560 --> 02:49:42.200]  I want everybody to spread the word about Infowars.com and PrisonBunny.com because you
[02:49:42.200 --> 02:49:44.280]  either become big fish or you get eaten.
[02:49:44.280 --> 02:49:45.960]  We are in incredible danger.
[02:49:45.960 --> 02:49:49.560]  I tell people that come to work here that I mean, you're getting into the real deal.
[02:49:49.560 --> 02:49:52.160]  This is not a game and I need people's prayers.
[02:49:52.160 --> 02:49:53.160]  I need your support.
[02:49:53.160 --> 02:49:54.160]  I need your financial support.
[02:49:54.160 --> 02:49:58.560]  I need you to buy the books, the seeds, the water filters, the horrible food from efoodsdirect.com
[02:49:58.560 --> 02:49:59.560]  forward slash Alex.
[02:49:59.560 --> 02:50:03.440]  They got 25% off this month, by the way, I need people to support all our sponsors.
[02:50:03.440 --> 02:50:04.440]  God bless you.
[02:50:04.440 --> 02:50:05.440]  I appreciate your call, sir.
[02:50:05.440 --> 02:50:11.760]  We're gonna come back and talk to Colin and Joe and Jeremy and Chad and Tracy and a bunch
[02:50:11.760 --> 02:50:18.560]  of other people, but I mean, this is not your average little egomaniac show where the host
[02:50:18.560 --> 02:50:25.480]  is on the air and has butterflies and loves going to Hollywood galas and loves strutting
[02:50:25.480 --> 02:50:26.480]  around and things.
[02:50:26.480 --> 02:50:31.120]  I mean, I just could care less, literally, literally.
[02:50:31.120 --> 02:50:35.000]  I would be hunting and fishing and hiking and oil painting and going to art shows.
[02:50:35.000 --> 02:50:39.880]  I'm like a redneck that likes art and literature and poetry and the symphony and also country
[02:50:39.880 --> 02:50:45.720]  music and heavy metal and bluegrass and rock and roll and I just love my wife and my kids
[02:50:45.720 --> 02:50:49.200]  and I'm just here to fight these murderers.
[02:50:49.200 --> 02:50:50.200]  I mean, I see them.
[02:50:50.200 --> 02:50:51.200]  I know who they are.
[02:50:51.200 --> 02:50:55.600]  God gave me an intellect to fight these people and it's my job to burn them down.
[02:50:55.600 --> 02:50:58.040]  I will, with your help, we'll be right back.

[02:55:07.720 --> 02:55:11.640]  I was thinking during the break about all of this and
[02:55:11.640 --> 02:55:17.720]  I was reading a comment here in an article a boston marathon bombing a stage terror attack. Let's punch this up and
[02:55:18.560 --> 02:55:24.080]  Let's read what rough and ready had to say it says when I first started to listen to the Alex Jones
[02:55:24.080 --> 02:55:28.760]  I thought he was the biggest crackpot on the face of the earth most sincere apologies Alex
[02:55:28.760 --> 02:55:31.520]  I guess no one wants their comfort zone invaded by boogeymen
[02:55:31.520 --> 02:55:35.760]  I am very glad that someone is on the tower paying attention to what's going on
[02:55:35.760 --> 02:55:37.760]  I guess it would be like pulling guard duty
[02:55:37.760 --> 02:55:44.440]  For how long yeah, while watching the globalists come out all the crimes and nobody else could seem to see it because of their normalcy bias
[02:55:45.400 --> 02:55:51.160]  Yeah, and watching everything overrun and kids dying of deadly vaccines buddy, and then you can get it, okay?
[02:55:51.160 --> 02:55:54.160]  That's why I get like this because you just get so sick of watching it
[02:55:54.160 --> 02:55:58.480]  You don't care anymore about what they do to you. You just want to defeat them you want to stop it
[02:55:58.480 --> 02:56:01.200]  I don't know how long you've been doing this 18 years
[02:56:01.200 --> 02:56:06.000]  But I say thank you for myself and my kids and my family and my family and my family and my family
[02:56:06.000 --> 02:56:10.040]  I say thank you for myself and my kids and grandbabies keep up the fight Bravo
[02:56:10.040 --> 02:56:15.200]  I suppose we all need to pull our heads out of our and do something now everyone needs to focus on
[02:56:15.320 --> 02:56:23.320]  The superiors the military and the police forces so we can clean this mess up in an internal mop-up effort when you find a person who?
[02:56:25.160 --> 02:56:29.160]  Strips the nose and the situation are knowingly involved and
[02:56:29.720 --> 02:56:34.280]  Trying to disarm us shove the communist crap down our throats defend freedom
[02:56:34.280 --> 02:56:41.200]  Making sure that our children and grandchildren remain free is the most important job a real American once again. Thanks Alex
[02:56:42.440 --> 02:56:45.000]  And oh oh here's what I wanted to ask I was thinking about her in the break
[02:56:45.000 --> 02:56:50.160]  I see keep seeing comments, and I've been so busy. I haven't able to look it up reportedly Tuesday night
[02:56:50.160 --> 02:56:52.160]  Or was it Wednesday night?
[02:56:52.200 --> 02:56:55.240]  Because I woke up like midnight last night was reading stuff about it
[02:56:55.240 --> 02:57:02.520]  I saw it again that that our favorite redcoat Piers Morgan more of his employees have been indicted for conspiracy
[02:57:02.520 --> 02:57:04.520]  He looks really freaked out on TV
[02:57:05.720 --> 02:57:07.720]  That's scallywag
[02:57:07.760 --> 02:57:13.000]  Reportedly yet Robert bear the former CIA guy on by the way I pocket-dialed him two weeks ago accidentally
[02:57:13.000 --> 02:57:18.080]  We have Robert bear's number in there in Colorado call and try to get bear on and bear was saying
[02:57:18.880 --> 02:57:21.960]  Reportedly I haven't seen this yet. I don't know if it's true. I just keep seeing it on the web
[02:57:21.960 --> 02:57:23.960]  I mean it probably is I see in multiple places
[02:57:24.920 --> 02:57:29.280]  That he was on Piers Morgan saying this could be disgruntled Navy SEALs
[02:57:29.280 --> 02:57:31.240]  And
[02:57:31.240 --> 02:57:37.080]  Was reading that off a teleprompter, or he seemed upset while he was saying it be yeah was Robert bear on there
[02:57:38.000 --> 02:57:40.520]  Robert bear on FBI investigation of the external
[02:57:41.800 --> 02:57:45.680]  Extramarital affair that caused the resignation of CIA director David Petraeus now. That's not it
[02:57:46.600 --> 02:57:51.200]  They said he was on Piers Morgan this week. I keep saying I don't even know that's true
[02:57:51.720 --> 02:57:54.040]  Maybe he was on something else and people gotten the meme wrong
[02:57:54.040 --> 02:57:58.320]  There's something to that Robert bear reportedly said this and I've seen it like five places
[02:57:58.320 --> 02:58:01.480]  You see it on YouTube so people could be info wars

[03:00:42.520 --> 03:00:44.520]  I
[03:00:45.880 --> 03:00:47.640]  Got a couple of points here man
[03:00:47.640 --> 03:00:54.480]  Um, the first one is for the Patsy's Billy Joe Jim Bob and the other ones that they were about to crucify
[03:00:55.000 --> 03:00:56.840]  I'm gonna put it like this man
[03:00:56.840 --> 03:01:01.960]  These guys are in extreme danger because when the system changes paths that way and goes a different direction
[03:01:02.720 --> 03:01:04.960]  They don't just leave the other one out in the open
[03:01:04.960 --> 03:01:09.880]  They have to execute and erase that so you guys have to come out if even one of them is listening
[03:01:09.880 --> 03:01:14.000]  Are you guys have to come out and come forward with everything that you know, no, no, no, no
[03:01:14.000 --> 03:01:16.400]  No, they pulled into the courthouse. They were about to roll out the guy
[03:01:16.600 --> 03:01:19.400]  They said we have the guy we've arrested them who we think did it
[03:01:19.400 --> 03:01:23.800]  We're gonna roll it out at five and then oh my gosh bomb threat and army trucks pull in and pull out with a guy
[03:01:24.320 --> 03:01:29.160]  And I saw that happen and the caller was talking about it. He's probably dead already
[03:01:30.200 --> 03:01:35.360]  But who knows they may not have killed him. I mean who knows what they've done. They may have other rednecks down the road
[03:01:35.360 --> 03:01:37.360]  They're gonna blame it on. I mean, you don't know
[03:01:37.360 --> 03:01:39.840]  Perhaps and my other point
[03:01:40.640 --> 03:01:42.440]  Alex is that
[03:01:42.440 --> 03:01:45.520]  Leos and all these people aren't aren't the only people with power
[03:01:45.520 --> 03:01:51.040]  They have actually no power that any of the other constituents don't if you see people breaking the Constitution
[03:01:51.200 --> 03:01:55.920]  If you see people breaking the law break your hands on them arrest somebody you know what I mean?
[03:01:55.920 --> 03:01:57.500]  This is what I'm saying to all the people out there
[03:01:57.500 --> 03:02:00.040]  Maybe what we need is woven horns are just good people
[03:02:00.600 --> 03:02:04.400]  Arresting people breaking the law. Well, I mean more and more if a cop is breaking the law
[03:02:04.400 --> 03:02:06.720]  You're supposed to be able to citizen arrest him, but they'll shoot you
[03:02:06.720 --> 03:02:08.480]  I mean, they're on such a power trip
[03:02:08.480 --> 03:02:13.720]  Not all the cops a lot of cops are waking up that the globalists have over overplayed their hand overcooked this
[03:02:14.680 --> 03:02:17.080]  It's the opposite a half-baked. They've over baked it
[03:02:17.200 --> 03:02:21.600]  You've got to really reach out and go come on break the trance and with cops go treat me with respect
[03:02:22.120 --> 03:02:27.280]  Stop doing what you're doing stop violent my rights, and they arrest you for no reason you sue them by the way
[03:02:27.280 --> 03:02:29.280]  We have the veteran on at three
[03:02:29.880 --> 03:02:35.280]  The highly decorated combat vet who was just walking out by a farm with a rifle and the cops arrested him
[03:02:35.280 --> 03:02:37.000]  I've got him on the nightly news tonight
[03:02:37.000 --> 03:02:39.440]  I'm gonna take that at three and then it'll be live tonight
[03:02:39.440 --> 03:02:43.160]  And the guys will air my interview at the end of the live seven o'clock to eight will be live
[03:02:43.160 --> 03:02:47.080]  And then we'll take the you know air the taped interview with the fella, but that's set up now
[03:02:47.080 --> 03:02:52.800]  And you know those temple cops need to be fired. I mean yeah, I mean the guy they grabbed him
[03:02:52.800 --> 03:02:54.800]  They were the ones that assaulted him
[03:02:55.320 --> 03:02:56.920]  He didn't do anything
[03:02:56.920 --> 03:03:01.400]  And it's really hard when a cop grabs you for no reason to not you know push him back
[03:03:01.400 --> 03:03:03.400]  I mean, it's just it's wrong
[03:03:03.400 --> 03:03:07.320]  You know you know it's wrong. I mean you know one time a guy started a fight with me
[03:03:07.320 --> 03:03:11.620]  I was beating him up pretty bad and the football coach ran into the cafeteria and grabbed me
[03:03:11.620 --> 03:03:12.220]  He was a big guy
[03:03:12.220 --> 03:03:16.440]  And I didn't resist him and slam me up against the wall because he you know had to get fired up be able to grab
[03:03:16.440 --> 03:03:18.640]  Me and do that. I didn't hit him because he was on the right
[03:03:18.640 --> 03:03:21.800]  I was kicking the guy's butt, but you don't just cover some guy done nothing
[03:03:21.800 --> 03:03:25.000]  He's go come here. Yeah, just grab him and slam him on things
[03:03:25.000 --> 03:03:27.400]  I mean I would really have trouble putting up with that
[03:03:27.400 --> 03:03:32.720]  I mean I'm tired of men who want to assault us, but we can't fight back. It's cowardly
[03:03:32.720 --> 03:03:34.720]  Don't you agree I?
[03:03:35.280 --> 03:03:39.880]  Think I think that the law provides that you can fight back, and that's what I'm trying to say no
[03:03:39.880 --> 03:03:43.900]  That's what Indiana rather to repass a law stating that that's in common law man
[03:03:44.160 --> 03:03:47.120]  If our servants are out of order we have every right to defend ourselves
[03:03:47.120 --> 03:03:51.120]  But I mean I don't want to fight with the police. I don't want you to be my enemy
[03:03:51.120 --> 03:03:55.760]  I don't buy into the propaganda of you're all a bunch of pig demons the government's corrupt
[03:03:55.760 --> 03:04:00.100]  They're trying to make you do bad things. I want to wake you up. I want to save America
[03:04:00.100 --> 03:04:05.400]  I want our children to grow together into the future, and I think most cops want that especially older ones
[03:04:05.400 --> 03:04:11.320]  Who've been around and aren't on power trips anymore. It's the young steroid head ones bugging their eyes out
[03:04:11.320 --> 03:04:14.040]  I'm like dude. You know see one downtown bugging their eyes
[03:04:14.040 --> 03:04:17.680]  I just look at me go you really want to act tough and sit here and do this
[03:04:17.960 --> 03:04:19.520]  You may be able to kick my butt
[03:04:19.520 --> 03:04:24.120]  But if you've actually assaulted me you're gonna get in a fight with somebody who literally blacks out and goes
[03:04:24.120 --> 03:04:31.240]  110 percent and then I know they'd end up just shooting me. I mean it scares me how cowardly they are it scares me
[03:04:31.760 --> 03:04:36.120]  That you know they want to play captain caveman, and they're not captain caveman you see what I'm saying
[03:04:36.800 --> 03:04:41.280]  Yeah, I get it. I mean you know it's just it's just I don't even get off in the cops
[03:04:41.280 --> 03:04:46.320]  I'm so sick of it. Just wish it's just it's more than hating people. It's I'm disgusted
[03:04:46.320 --> 03:04:50.520]  I want good things for them, but I open the phones up for cops. They load the lines agreeing
[03:04:50.520 --> 03:04:56.120]  I I run the cops on most cops. I run into cops downtown. It's like a celebrity event. They're all listeners and
[03:04:56.840 --> 03:05:01.360]  They're like we're sorry. We're told to write tickets. We don't like it either. We like your show

[03:08:37.160 --> 03:08:39.160]  I
[03:08:39.160 --> 03:08:41.160]  I
[03:09:05.280 --> 03:09:07.280]  Got the photos
[03:09:07.280 --> 03:09:11.760]  I'm a baby feels not just the ones we had yesterday crawling all over the finish line
[03:09:13.080 --> 03:09:20.720]  yards in some cases from where the bomb went off with big black backpacks and the media will not touch this and it's lied and
[03:09:20.720 --> 03:09:23.440]  Said there was no drill that witnesses said they were told be calm
[03:09:23.440 --> 03:09:28.680]  don't worry about all this because obviously people with black backpacks everywhere is pretty obvious and they have the
[03:09:29.320 --> 03:09:31.920]  You know, they have the Patsy's they're all of it
[03:09:31.920 --> 03:09:39.760]  If the only way this isn't purely staged and a hundred percent government is they found mentally ill which which even the New York Times
[03:09:39.760 --> 03:09:41.760]  guys just type in New York Times
[03:09:42.680 --> 03:09:46.600]  FBI terror, you know the article came out last April 28th
[03:09:47.120 --> 03:09:53.360]  Where they admit it was there's over a hundred cases where the government company and of course we expose this but I make the New York
[03:09:53.360 --> 03:09:58.600]  Times even admits it come on that they totally find mentally ill people on average 75 IQ
[03:09:58.600 --> 03:10:04.800]  they have a whole formula a Muslim right-wing left-wing doesn't matter mentally ill and they wind them up to do it and
[03:10:05.320 --> 03:10:09.560]  The bare minimum is I mean you look at the Patsy's they look like that
[03:10:09.560 --> 03:10:13.360]  I mean if I saw these guys at a bus stop, you'd say that's a mental patient
[03:10:13.720 --> 03:10:18.560]  You look at who we believe they were gonna go with as the Patsy because they were already saying the right-wing did it
[03:10:19.080 --> 03:10:24.360]  They they jumped the gun they screwed up. So I know you're all watching right now the global of stars
[03:10:24.360 --> 03:10:28.080]  So take lessons here next time you do this. You want to get away with it. I'm being sarcastic folks
[03:10:28.080 --> 03:10:30.080]  We're all watching you
[03:10:30.640 --> 03:10:36.080]  We're we're watching you and you think you're watching us and you say we're gonna stick our hands down your pants
[03:10:36.080 --> 03:10:41.000]  And now the Army's gonna look at your papers. Okay, good. We're watching you
[03:10:41.880 --> 03:10:48.720]  How you like that and that's it man army shows up around Austin. I'm going to confront them. I'm done. I'm done
[03:10:48.720 --> 03:10:50.520]  I'm gonna go get in their face
[03:10:50.520 --> 03:10:55.780]  I'm gonna say the government staged the attack and you're violating posse commentatis. Get out of here
[03:10:55.780 --> 03:11:01.640]  You're not gonna come up to me with my wife and check our papers and search our bags about protecting me
[03:11:01.860 --> 03:11:05.000]  Your boss has ran these attacks and I'm sick of it
[03:11:05.940 --> 03:11:11.300]  It's simple you want jurisdiction into my life to get over the Bill of Rights the Constitution your bosses are staging this
[03:11:11.500 --> 03:11:17.140]  While they butcher America, I'm done. I don't live in Baghdad. I don't live in the West Bank of Israel

[03:11:22.460 --> 03:11:23.940]  Do you speak?
[03:11:23.940 --> 03:11:25.300]  Constitution
[03:11:25.300 --> 03:11:27.300]  You comprehend that jackass
[03:11:27.860 --> 03:11:30.660]  Excuse me, folks John in Texas. You're on the air. Go ahead
[03:11:32.940 --> 03:11:34.940]  John Joe in Texas, sorry, go ahead
[03:11:35.780 --> 03:11:40.140]  This is Joe. Yes, sir. Go ahead Joe. Hi. Hi Alex. Thanks for taking a call
[03:11:40.140 --> 03:11:42.940]  I want to make God I'll be very quick number one
[03:11:42.940 --> 03:11:46.900]  I wanted to say to your listeners that I've watched I've listened to you for over three years
[03:11:47.260 --> 03:11:51.020]  I have read probably 50 books as a result of listening to you
[03:11:51.020 --> 03:11:58.020]  I can tell your listeners out there that infowars is an extremely credible organization and the fact that you do things on such an evidence-based
[03:11:59.300 --> 03:12:03.900]  Way of approaching the news and stuff. I totally agree with I'm an attorney
[03:12:03.980 --> 03:12:06.820]  So I take that very seriously and I appreciate what you do
[03:12:06.820 --> 03:12:07.620]  Thank you, sir
[03:12:07.620 --> 03:12:15.040]  We saw the reason I called today was to give you a little different perspective or my perspective on this boss Boston thing
[03:12:15.420 --> 03:12:17.140]  And looking and looking at it
[03:12:17.140 --> 03:12:24.140]  I know everybody's talking about the importance of of how much what's what I've really seen seen revealed over the last day or two
[03:12:24.460 --> 03:12:30.140]  Because I've been lucky enough to be home and watched all this unfold on prison planet TV, which has been great for me
[03:12:30.860 --> 03:12:37.620]  But is is that it's about it's about the power of the media about the power of the visual media the fact that so many
[03:12:38.180 --> 03:12:40.020]  perspectives and cameras
[03:12:40.020 --> 03:12:43.780]  Operationally have been at this event and it's been very hard for things to be hidden
[03:12:43.780 --> 03:12:47.220]  I've seen the authorities attempt to use this to
[03:12:47.940 --> 03:12:54.900]  Shape the story they want and I've seen more importantly people like yourself and other people who have given information to infowars
[03:12:55.180 --> 03:13:00.060]  help shape the truth and so the moral of the story for me is if
[03:13:00.900 --> 03:13:07.980]  That this phenomena of visual media this phenomena is actually what's allowing the truth to unfold
[03:13:08.180 --> 03:13:12.860]  For us all now having said that here's my unusual perspective
[03:13:12.860 --> 03:13:20.540]  Because I've seen such a powerful event take place because of all the media and all the visual footage from different angles
[03:13:20.620 --> 03:13:22.620]  different people and sources
[03:13:22.940 --> 03:13:25.020]  Then historically my mind goes back
[03:13:25.740 --> 03:13:32.140]  to the fact that we have had this kind of thing occur before and I'm speaking specifically of
[03:13:32.980 --> 03:13:34.980]  Oklahoma City the Pentagon 9-11
[03:13:35.620 --> 03:13:40.980]  Sandy Hook places we know that there's tons of visual information on but it's being suppressed
[03:13:40.980 --> 03:13:48.500]  And so here is it just to me illuminates and incriminates the government even further for withholding
[03:13:48.940 --> 03:13:55.940]  What we know exists well think about this these photos of the redneck suspects of the Saudi suspects with
[03:13:56.200 --> 03:13:57.900]  surrounded by their handlers
[03:13:57.900 --> 03:14:05.840]  Army and and and Navy Special Forces just crawling right beside them and a drill they're lying about and again
[03:14:05.840 --> 03:14:09.420]  We're not saying the Navy Seals did this they're called out for the drill to create the confusion
[03:14:09.420 --> 03:14:14.960]  And then whatever the group is from a you know nonprofit government-funded liberal think tank
[03:14:15.620 --> 03:14:20.780]  We all know who folks was involved in other events. They can then go have their patsy do it
[03:14:21.380 --> 03:14:22.580]  or
[03:14:22.580 --> 03:14:25.580]  When this is the minority of events because they usually are too stupid to do it
[03:14:25.580 --> 03:14:30.780]  They may have found idiots that were that they wound up and let do it and they and they've been caught doing that quite a few
[03:14:30.780 --> 03:14:34.340]  Times so that's but regardless you keep your hands off my rights
[03:14:34.540 --> 03:14:38.400]  You know you got probably 50 people dead from this fertilizer explosion nobody knows
[03:14:38.400 --> 03:14:41.880]  And it's like give up our rights, and we are we gonna ban factories
[03:14:42.600 --> 03:14:44.920]  Cuz something they've had factories blow up in Houston
[03:14:45.480 --> 03:14:51.400]  And kill hundreds of people they had a hurricane in you know that killed 10,000 people once in Galveston
[03:14:51.400 --> 03:14:58.160]  We're gonna ban hurricanes the point is they they obsess over these dead to try to sell us that our rights somehow did it and
[03:14:58.760 --> 03:15:01.920]  You know what I mean if I try to go somewhere or I run into one of these public events
[03:15:02.040 --> 03:15:03.480]  And the army wants to search me
[03:15:03.480 --> 03:15:05.480]  I'm not putting up with it and none of us should
[03:15:05.480 --> 03:15:10.100]  Because they had 400 troops already out there 2,000 police and this still happened
[03:15:10.180 --> 03:15:13.420]  You know that's the moral of the story you had Navy SEALs
[03:15:14.380 --> 03:15:16.740]  What looks like 20 feet to me?
[03:15:16.740 --> 03:15:20.500]  But let's just say 60 feet we're talking a stone's throw from the bombs
[03:15:20.500 --> 03:15:24.340]  And it didn't protect you we cannot have Navy SEALs on every street corner
[03:15:24.340 --> 03:15:28.340]  And if we did it won't protect us so I want my rights
[03:15:28.340 --> 03:15:32.500]  And they're mine, and I am demanding them god bless you good to hear from you
[03:15:32.500 --> 03:15:40.100]  And you know in law Joe it's about demanding rights rights aren't just given and they are they are demanded they are demanded
[03:15:41.300 --> 03:15:44.940]  Let's go ahead and talk to Tracy in Utah you're on the air welcome
[03:15:47.380 --> 03:15:51.780]  Hey Tracy talk around your phone for me, honey. Oh, can you hear me now? Yes, I can go ahead
[03:15:52.740 --> 03:15:59.100]  First of all it's an honor to actually get to talk to you me and my boss Sonia listen to you every single day and
[03:15:59.100 --> 03:16:06.140]  We are passionate, and we know that we have to get out there and get the public to see what's going on
[03:16:06.140 --> 03:16:11.620]  And to write letters and that was one of my questions was I would like to write letters to the
[03:16:11.980 --> 03:16:17.640]  Editors here in Utah, and I wanted to know if I could use info wars your name and the reporter who they?
[03:16:17.740 --> 03:16:19.740]  Let me find out the first amendment works
[03:16:20.580 --> 03:16:24.840]  Hollywood if it's for entertainment or something sold as
[03:16:24.840 --> 03:16:29.720]  entertainment you have to get basically permission for pretty much anything unless it's a
[03:16:30.520 --> 03:16:34.240]  Public figure or something well-known everything else is wide open
[03:16:34.240 --> 03:16:38.560]  I don't need permission to shoot news footage on the street in a public place and put it on TV
[03:16:38.560 --> 03:16:42.560]  We'll be filming all the time, and so we'll walk through our image and go you're not allowed to film me
[03:16:42.560 --> 03:16:45.000]  And I'm like it's for news sir sue me
[03:16:45.880 --> 03:16:50.320]  So some explain you can use info wars anywhere as long as you're not selling something out of it
[03:16:50.320 --> 03:16:54.320]  You can talk about info wars in a novel you write you can even if it is fiction
[03:16:54.320 --> 03:16:59.720]  You can put it on a bumper sticker you can you can what people always ask can I write about what you're doing and I'm?
[03:16:59.720 --> 03:17:03.440]  Like of course you can but not because I authorize you to show so yes
[03:17:03.960 --> 03:17:05.960]  You know do whatever you want
[03:17:05.960 --> 03:17:07.960]  Everybody's got permission for whatever they want to do
[03:17:08.240 --> 03:17:14.080]  You know as long as I have to keep my copyright because David Ike was so nice years ago
[03:17:14.080 --> 03:17:18.040]  He said you know do whatever you want my material people then took it copyrighted it
[03:17:18.040 --> 03:17:22.520]  And then said he couldn't publish it so that's why I have copyright on a lot of my stuff is so I
[03:17:22.520 --> 03:17:27.800]  I maintain my right to use it, but it's it's it's it's fair use for all of you
[03:17:27.800 --> 03:17:34.200]  But not by me giving you that fair use right that fair use is inherent so study fair fair use ma'am, but
[03:17:34.720 --> 03:17:37.960]  Absolutely feel free to write letters to the editor all the time every day
[03:17:37.960 --> 03:17:40.640]  We get emails can I write a letter to the editor about info wars calm
[03:17:40.960 --> 03:17:46.560]  Well, yeah, of course you can you can write a letter to the editor about how you like the Cowboys or about how you like?
[03:17:46.840 --> 03:17:51.600]  Strawberries or or how you like Vincent van Gogh. I mean you can write about how you like
[03:17:51.600 --> 03:17:53.600]  like
[03:17:53.960 --> 03:17:57.800]  Gerard Depardieu or however you say his name or how you like George Lucas
[03:17:57.800 --> 03:18:00.680]  I mean whatever you can do what or how you like Drudge Report
[03:18:01.000 --> 03:18:03.120]  You know letters to the editor about Drudge Report great idea
[03:18:03.120 --> 03:18:07.240]  I mean you can do whatever you want, but it's not that I'm giving you the permission you understand you already have it
[03:18:08.680 --> 03:18:09.920]  Well, that's okay well
[03:18:09.920 --> 03:18:16.320]  I just want me and my boss and others believe it's exactly like you if we don't stand up and fight for our rights
[03:18:16.320 --> 03:18:21.000]  We're gonna lose them and people have to wake up, and that's what I we want to do is get the word out
[03:18:21.000 --> 03:18:25.140]  Well, they think you're so stupid that they had all these operatives there when they did these bombs
[03:18:25.920 --> 03:18:29.120]  And again, they weren't there looking for a bomb either. It was totally staged
[03:18:29.960 --> 03:18:35.660]  And and and now they're covering up who they know really did it you think we have ideas they know because they did it
[03:18:35.800 --> 03:18:38.680]  This is an investigation. This is a wedding of the appetite
[03:18:39.520 --> 03:18:42.800]  So people need to get our articles on this out to everybody
[03:18:42.800 --> 03:18:49.100]  I mean, this is a this is an info war going on right now folks over who could control this narrative
[03:18:49.100 --> 03:18:54.420]  We've caught them with their pants down, but if we don't expose that they won't go down a god bless you
[03:18:54.420 --> 03:18:57.820]  Good to hear from you. Let's talk to Chad in Ohio. Go ahead. You're on the air
[03:18:59.360 --> 03:19:05.440]  Alex good to talk to you. Hey um I know it's early, but the fertilizer plants in
[03:19:06.080 --> 03:19:11.400]  Texas there are some videos surfacing on the internet some people have taken videos from different vantage points
[03:19:11.400 --> 03:19:14.920]  Yeah, you see the fire jump jump for about a hundred yards away into the building
[03:19:14.920 --> 03:19:20.760]  But that's the fumes of the cooking cooking fertilizer, and then it just like gasoline fumes catches on fire
[03:19:20.760 --> 03:19:22.760]  I don't think it's a missile go ahead
[03:19:23.080 --> 03:19:29.960]  What I see is something that's moving against the wind the smoke is moving off in one direction, and there's something actually coming in
[03:19:31.640 --> 03:19:35.600]  I've seen something looks like that. I just I I just don't know anymore
[03:19:35.600 --> 03:19:42.960]  I mean would they blow up something to divert away from the bombshell that their whole op got blown they canceled all this stuff
[03:19:42.960 --> 03:19:45.720]  Yes, I mean it is a possibility, but I mean
[03:19:46.600 --> 03:19:51.500]  Everything can't be a conspiracy. I mean I just I have to see proof, but yeah that the videos are suspicious
[03:19:53.000 --> 03:19:56.880]  There's a mass awakening. I mean your ratings is a testament to it
[03:19:57.560 --> 03:20:03.120]  People are really on the ball. It's amazing how how fast the cover stories are falling apart for the Boston bombing
[03:20:04.360 --> 03:20:08.580]  People are just they're looking and they're skeptical and they're gonna break these stories
[03:20:09.280 --> 03:20:11.280]  one other thing I'd like to bring up is
[03:20:11.280 --> 03:20:16.160]  The reason that we can have such conversations about these false flag attacks
[03:20:16.160 --> 03:20:19.360]  I think one of the you know one of the deadliest false flag attacks on American soil
[03:20:19.600 --> 03:20:23.580]  9-eleven has woke a lot of people up and the organization that has done
[03:20:23.580 --> 03:20:29.360]  I think more than most to lay out and break down the forensic scientific evidence is of course
[03:20:29.760 --> 03:20:34.760]  Architects and engineers for 9-eleven truth. I would love it. I mean these guys haven't been sitting on their hands
[03:20:34.760 --> 03:20:39.400]  They've been very active, and I would love it if you could have Richard Gage back on your program I
[03:20:39.400 --> 03:20:40.880]  I
[03:20:40.880 --> 03:20:44.720]  Hear you brother. God bless you good to hear from you. Let's go to Julio in, Illinois
[03:20:44.720 --> 03:20:47.320]  He's been a we are change reporter done great work for us as well
[03:20:47.320 --> 03:20:51.400]  If this is indeed Julio recognize his voice Julio was that you my friend
[03:20:52.000 --> 03:20:56.960]  It is Alex. Aloha. How are you my friend good man? This is crazy. What's going on now? What's your take?
[03:20:58.300 --> 03:21:01.040]  Absolutely is crazy great job with the with the work
[03:21:01.040 --> 03:21:05.320]  I mean what I do when I win when when big events happen
[03:21:05.320 --> 03:21:09.920]  I I stay away from the corporate media, and I go straight to local media
[03:21:09.920 --> 03:21:14.360]  And that's what I did on Monday, and I was able to record W CD
[03:21:15.320 --> 03:21:21.920]  VB it's a Boston ABC owned and operated affiliate ABC 5 and one of their reporters
[03:21:21.920 --> 03:21:28.680]  I found this very interesting said that the head of FEMA, which is Craig Fugate was in boss
[03:21:28.680 --> 03:21:33.920]  Oh, no, that's true. They were all there. They were all there. Just like they were all there for 7-7 bombing
[03:21:33.920 --> 03:21:35.920]  Yeah, no that is confirmed. Yes
[03:21:37.200 --> 03:21:45.560]  It's just so fascinating to see it just watching yesterday corporate media. Oh, we found someone they arrested someone John King of CNN
[03:21:45.560 --> 03:21:50.160]  Oh, it's a dark-skinned male and then within 15 minutes. Oh wait
[03:21:50.160 --> 03:21:54.160]  We don't have that Wolf Blitzer on Monday said numerous times
[03:21:54.640 --> 03:21:59.040]  Remember folks first reports may always be false and then two minutes later
[03:21:59.040 --> 03:22:04.200]  They have someone on plugging the white extremists the right-wing extremists last summer
[03:22:04.200 --> 03:22:11.320]  I was at Oak Creek, Wisconsin following the Sikh temple shooting, and I had the US District Attorney of Wisconsin James
[03:22:11.320 --> 03:22:18.120]  Don't tell II it meant to me that the government likes to use those types of labels even though they have no proof
[03:22:18.320 --> 03:22:23.720]  That someone's a domestic terrorist. Let's stop right there next time. There's a bombing or shooting in your area
[03:22:23.720 --> 03:22:29.440]  Immediately go to it and and I mean you may see feds standing over kids shooting them
[03:22:29.440 --> 03:22:31.040]  You know to have a higher death count
[03:22:31.040 --> 03:22:34.480]  I mean they they act like they can cover everything up and and and and but listen
[03:22:34.720 --> 03:22:38.960]  Just like I said with Kurt Haskell when they caught the government getting on the plane and later it was confirmed
[03:22:39.240 --> 03:22:41.600]  And the FBI came to his office tried to intimidate him
[03:22:41.680 --> 03:22:48.040]  We are blowing every one of their ops now because this isn't the old game. We know their tricks and and but still
[03:22:48.040 --> 03:22:53.400]  They they have such disdain for the public. They don't care if we're out here exposing them
[03:22:53.440 --> 03:22:58.860]  They're like oh, we'll just call them conspiracy theorists, but it doesn't work anymore. I mean do people understand
[03:22:59.520 --> 03:23:02.880]  Yeah, I called Watson this morning, and I said this is 20 times bigger than anything
[03:23:02.880 --> 03:23:07.040]  We've ever been part of god bless what's happened good job. You know right now. We've exposed
[03:23:07.040 --> 03:23:09.720]  It's a false flag, but now we have to get it out to everybody, but we have the proof
[03:23:09.720 --> 03:23:14.960]  We have them we have them now, and I said no no it's not a 20 times bigger. It's a hundred times bigger I
[03:23:14.960 --> 03:23:17.440]  Cannot tell you Julio
[03:23:18.120 --> 03:23:20.960]  I'm sure you know this we have caught them with their pants off
[03:23:21.120 --> 03:23:27.440]  I mean we have them. I mean we have them and lying about the drill. We have these bastards and
[03:23:29.640 --> 03:23:31.640]  Praise God I mean it shows
[03:23:32.160 --> 03:23:37.880]  Commitment if you are committed and you study and you focus and you work these are men, too
[03:23:37.880 --> 03:23:39.040]  That's why they're so scared of us
[03:23:39.040 --> 03:23:43.480]  It's why they put poison in our water to dumb us down well once you're conscious of what they've done to us
[03:23:43.480 --> 03:23:48.960]  You just got up more in your brain. I mean if you tell yourself to boost your IQ. It'll boost in a crisis
[03:23:49.480 --> 03:23:56.480]  Humanity needs to go to this slug like slug like trance and take action Julio, and we're gonna win this thing anything else
[03:23:57.200 --> 03:24:00.280]  Yeah, yeah, I can only speak from experience. I covered the NATO summit
[03:24:00.280 --> 03:24:06.640]  I was officially credentialed for that and I can speak from experience covering high-profile events that they make sure
[03:24:07.160 --> 03:24:12.360]  To check your bags before you enter anywhere. I was checked by Secret Service in the media
[03:24:12.360 --> 03:24:15.440]  No, they admit. They had people searching bags and seek bombshell
[03:24:15.440 --> 03:24:20.060]  You just said it they are on record in fact tell my writers right now look this up as I heard on the news
[03:24:20.320 --> 03:24:24.460]  They were searching bags at the start and finish line. Why then did they let?
[03:24:25.180 --> 03:24:29.840]  20 people or more in with giant black backpacks. I mean this is so incredibly obvious
[03:24:29.840 --> 03:24:35.280]  How did the bombs get in when everybody was being searched again inside job anybody?
[03:24:37.000 --> 03:24:40.720]  For them to say oh we did a bomb sweep twice. That's a lie
[03:24:40.720 --> 03:24:45.560]  I I covered NATO they did bomb sweeps every 30 minutes
[03:24:45.560 --> 03:24:52.580]  They made sure nothing entered that wasn't supposed to end because that's actual globalist who might actually get bombed by one of their compadres
[03:24:52.580 --> 03:24:57.720]  And there's real infighting exactly no no no you get a proctology exam near a g20 or anything
[03:24:57.720 --> 03:25:02.280]  I mean this is incredible. Thank you. Julio great points get that video out on YouTube. You may have already done it
[03:25:02.600 --> 03:25:06.160]  Let's talk to Jeremy you're on the air Jeremy from Indiana
[03:25:06.160 --> 03:25:12.600]  I like hi Jeremy. How are you? I'm all right brother all right. I just want to commend you so much for what you're doing
[03:25:13.040 --> 03:25:14.280]  I
[03:25:14.280 --> 03:25:17.960]  Don't even know where to begin first of all everything that happened in Boston
[03:25:18.560 --> 03:25:25.560]  Thank you. It's not a surprise. It's it's happening here in Indiana. We can't even get you on the radio in Indiana anymore
[03:25:28.080 --> 03:25:32.200]  I'm at Purdue University right after this yesterday a bomb
[03:25:32.720 --> 03:25:34.720]  Once they said there's a bomb on campus
[03:25:34.720 --> 03:25:40.320]  All the guards came out the SWAT team everything they brought robots out. They blasted it
[03:25:41.600 --> 03:25:44.040]  It was a real windy day. It was a
[03:25:44.840 --> 03:25:48.160]  information flyer holder for a realtor in the street
[03:25:48.920 --> 03:25:55.960]  They never told the school it was anything else kids are running around scared and now they're high-fiving each other saying
[03:25:56.000 --> 03:26:00.640]  We were victorious. We were ready for this. This is what we trained for this is what we do
[03:26:00.640 --> 03:26:08.820]  I don't know America doesn't manufacture things now we give degrees to people to mind us and run our lives and boss us around and
[03:26:08.880 --> 03:26:14.720]  Young 20 year old army officers now who are you know who are MPs walk over and go light up give me your stuff
[03:26:14.720 --> 03:26:16.720]  And your family goes yes, sir
[03:26:17.520 --> 03:26:23.920]  I mean this is our servants taking us over and of course if they can blow up a few things and take our life over
[03:26:24.360 --> 03:26:27.240]  Guys put up the image of papers, please here in America
[03:26:27.240 --> 03:26:31.060]  I mean yeah, and I'm sorry snot nose kids come over to me and go let me see your papers
[03:26:31.060 --> 03:26:34.960]  I'm like you know what go to hell your boss is stage 9-11. I'm sick of your crap
[03:26:35.520 --> 03:26:39.680]  Jeremy thank you, Noah and Tejas you're on the air Noah go ahead
[03:26:40.500 --> 03:26:44.680]  Yes, sir. I just wanted to tell you about Monday. I clicked on Drudge
[03:26:44.680 --> 03:26:50.760]  he had a live live even I clicked on Drudge's live feed to the coverage of the bombing and
[03:26:51.920 --> 03:26:53.920]  When I clicked to it
[03:26:53.920 --> 03:26:59.640]  they had on they had on there somebody being interviewed named Chris Condon and
[03:27:00.840 --> 03:27:02.840]  when he was being interviewed he said

[03:27:09.280 --> 03:27:14.920]  But it was what it was between 2 50 p.m.. Central time and about 3 10
[03:27:15.520 --> 03:27:17.520]  Time, but he mentioned controlled
[03:27:18.040 --> 03:27:22.800]  Explosions oh no no we have news articles where they went we had controlled explosions as part of the drill
[03:27:22.800 --> 03:27:28.360]  And then they and we have witnesses saying drill no no they did that and they go that never happened and the Boston Marathon
[03:27:28.440 --> 03:27:31.680]  Never happened, but Santa Claus is real. Yeah, I don't know you're right
[03:27:31.680 --> 03:27:37.160]  No, they that's what I mean. I'm like okay controlled explosions drills. You say there wasn't drills our reporter brings it up
[03:27:37.160 --> 03:27:42.840]  There's no drill there was a drill now. We have the Navy SEALs and the troops there was a drill there was a drill
[03:27:42.840 --> 03:27:45.520]  You're lying. I mean we've got them exactly

[03:29:01.360 --> 03:29:06.200]  You know he gave a good recognition to the city of Boston, but he failed to make any mention on its
[03:29:07.120 --> 03:29:10.760]  Revolutionary roots you know this is where our country was started
[03:29:10.760 --> 03:29:17.000]  On Patriots Day. I'm originally from Massachusetts. That's to memorize the Battle of Lexington in Concord and

[03:33:37.140 --> 03:33:39.140]  You
[03:33:46.380 --> 03:33:51.580]  All right, and we are back. I'm Jigari Jackson filling in for Alex Jones. I'm here with David Knight
[03:33:51.580 --> 03:33:53.580]  How are you doing today David?
[03:33:53.580 --> 03:33:55.780]  Now we have a new clip of mrs.
[03:33:55.780 --> 03:34:02.700]  Napolitano being grilled about the the Boston situation about the Saudi national that's reportedly being deported and guys
[03:34:02.700 --> 03:34:05.220]  Just let me know when you have that up and ready, but in the meantime
[03:34:05.220 --> 03:34:10.380]  Let's go through a few articles David. What do you have right there? Well? We got a lot of interesting information
[03:34:10.780 --> 03:34:13.780]  It was they're talking about this ricin suspect
[03:34:14.580 --> 03:34:17.180]  And the Washington Post put out an article earlier today
[03:34:18.060 --> 03:34:20.060]  painting him as a paranoid
[03:34:20.500 --> 03:34:26.980]  Conspiracist Elvis impersonator yes, I saw that I saw that yeah, well. It's just come out that the Gateway Pundit
[03:34:28.260 --> 03:34:32.300]  Dug up some pictures of him, and he's actually a very strong Democrat activist
[03:34:32.300 --> 03:34:35.920]  Mm-hmm, so I don't know if they were trying to it certainly sounded like
[03:34:36.300 --> 03:34:42.100]  Wapow was trying to make a profile that he was some kind of a tea party guy so okay
[03:34:42.100 --> 03:34:45.420]  I think we have that video ready, so we'll go to that and then we'll come back and finish your thoughts
[03:34:45.420 --> 03:34:46.540]  So let's go to that video
[03:34:46.540 --> 03:34:53.500]  I'm very concerned about this person of interest that was detained at the hospital in Boston following the marathon madness
[03:34:53.500 --> 03:34:57.020]  He is I believe scheduled to be deported next week and now understand
[03:34:57.020 --> 03:35:00.180]  He's been cleared of any wrongdoing in the involvement in Boston
[03:35:00.180 --> 03:35:06.340]  But he is being deported due to national security concerns and but CBS says this this gentleman is here on a student
[03:35:06.340 --> 03:35:09.780]  They said he was at the scene along with many other people when the blast happened is
[03:35:10.020 --> 03:35:16.140]  Everybody's standing in shock three Boston PD detectives see this guy moving quickly out of the crowd as they're watching him
[03:35:16.140 --> 03:35:18.140]  He seems to be moving very deliberately
[03:35:18.580 --> 03:35:23.900]  Which could be a very natural thing after a bombing they stop him because he's covered with blood they end up taking the hospital
[03:35:23.900 --> 03:35:25.740]  That's straight off CBS
[03:35:25.740 --> 03:35:28.640]  And we're asking average Americans to help ID
[03:35:28.640 --> 03:35:31.280]  and assist law enforcement in
[03:35:32.000 --> 03:35:34.000]  identifying who the bomber was
[03:35:34.280 --> 03:35:39.520]  See something say something and now we have someone who is being deported due to national security concerns
[03:35:39.520 --> 03:35:42.880]  And I'm assuming that he's got some sort of link to terror or wouldn't be being deported
[03:35:43.040 --> 03:35:46.280]  He was at the scene he could possibly ID the bomber
[03:35:46.280 --> 03:35:52.920]  Just like we're asking every other American that was on the scene to provide your pictures help us identify who may have been acting funny
[03:35:53.360 --> 03:35:57.320]  Everybody we're asking that that was in Boston, and we've got this guy who was there
[03:35:57.320 --> 03:36:02.200]  We know he was there. He was arrested or what arrested was detained in the hospital covered with blood
[03:36:02.200 --> 03:36:08.360]  He was at the scene and yet we're going to deport him, so we're going to remove him from the scene
[03:36:08.360 --> 03:36:16.800]  I am unaware of anyone who is being deported for national security concerns at all related to Boston
[03:36:16.800 --> 03:36:22.440]  I don't know where nothing is related to Boston, but he is being deported. Oh, I like I said
[03:36:23.040 --> 03:36:25.040]  Again, I don't even think
[03:36:25.040 --> 03:36:30.440]  He was technically a person of interest or a suspect that was a wash
[03:36:30.440 --> 03:36:33.720]  And I'm unaware of any proceeding there
[03:36:33.720 --> 03:36:35.360]  I will clarify that for you
[03:36:35.360 --> 03:36:41.920]  But I think this is an example of why it is so important to let law enforcement do its job
[03:36:41.920 --> 03:36:43.160]  I want them to do their job
[03:36:43.160 --> 03:36:47.240]  And that's why I say wouldn't you agree with me that it's negligent for us as American
[03:36:47.520 --> 03:36:51.960]  Administration to deport someone who was reportedly at the scene of the bombing
[03:36:51.960 --> 03:36:56.560]  And we're going to deport him not to be able to question him anymore. Is that not negligence?
[03:36:56.560 --> 03:37:00.760]  I'm not going to answer that question is so full with misstatements and missed
[03:37:01.400 --> 03:37:03.400]  Apprehensions that it's just not worthy of an answer
[03:37:05.200 --> 03:37:09.640]  CBS reports the gentleman was there we did detain him at the hospital. He was covered with blood
[03:37:09.640 --> 03:37:16.040]  We've cleared him of any wrongdoing, but it has been reported. He is being deported on there's been so much reported on this
[03:37:16.040 --> 03:37:19.520]  That's been wrong. I can't even begin to tell you congressman
[03:37:19.520 --> 03:37:24.880]  We will provide you with accurate information as it becomes available. I look forward to that. Thank you
[03:37:24.880 --> 03:37:31.880]  I yield back. We will provide you with the accurate information as it becomes available they control reality
[03:37:31.880 --> 03:37:35.000]  Let's believe known liars just they have the information
[03:37:35.520 --> 03:37:41.520]  That's it shut your pie hole and drugs has no credibility. No winch. You have no credibility
[03:37:42.320 --> 03:37:46.900]  Exactly. I mean remember they used to say TSA does not grow up your genitals when there was thousands of videos
[03:37:46.900 --> 03:37:51.140]  And they're a bunch of damn liars. Well, you know, that's what you notice what she's doing
[03:37:51.140 --> 03:37:57.900]  It's a CBS report that Drudge linked to right and so she tries to discredit it by saying oh, it's coming from Drudge
[03:37:57.900 --> 03:38:00.820]  He didn't like the content. No CBS wrote the content
[03:38:00.820 --> 03:38:07.500]  That's what the the accomplishment kept trying to get her to understand that CBS CBS CBS said this but look at what they did yesterday
[03:38:07.500 --> 03:38:09.100]  You know, they were going to
[03:38:09.100 --> 03:38:12.660]  Release the identity of the bomber and then they didn't release that into the bomber, you know
[03:38:12.660 --> 03:38:19.100]  I thought they had them. I thought they had them and then we released the information about these other guys at the at the Boston race
[03:38:19.100 --> 03:38:24.100]  No, no, no, we're gonna cancel the FBI press conference knows what's going on, but she has the information
[03:38:24.100 --> 03:38:29.620]  She's the authority to go back and get married to Janet Reno and they can sail off into the sunset have children together
[03:38:29.740 --> 03:38:35.340]  But they kidnapped with CPS. Look how arrogant she is. They're scared man. It's a confidence game
[03:38:35.340 --> 03:38:38.040]  Hey, listen, you're witch pig. We know what you did
[03:38:38.040 --> 03:38:42.960]  I apologize about yelling here. That's okay. Got any hearing hearing left? I
[03:38:44.000 --> 03:38:49.480]  Love how we just leave these vitamins over here. It's like when we're doing the shot. There's like this big pile of vitamins
[03:38:53.200 --> 03:39:00.400]  All right, you are watching the Alex Jones show you can be watching this on infowars.com forward slash listen

[03:39:26.260 --> 03:39:30.100]  No, well, it certainly got on her skin and that congressman wasn't going to get let her get away with it
[03:39:30.100 --> 03:39:35.200]  And that was everybody needs to take a look at that because it's worth it just to see how upset she got exactly
[03:39:35.200 --> 03:39:39.280]  Yeah, I hope you concentrate like a big redneck eel. I just keep running in here

[03:40:51.980 --> 03:40:58.540]  Store like they have like some kind of thing where you can buy the hats and all the gear and it donates toward
[03:40:59.260 --> 03:41:03.460]  Some foundation so I guess my question with that is
[03:41:04.220 --> 03:41:06.900]  If it's in you know if it's really an inside job
[03:41:07.180 --> 03:41:10.340]  Are they trying to hide in plain sight or do you think this could be?
[03:41:10.940 --> 03:41:16.180]  If it has any validity to being an actual group could they be trying to hide that's a great point
[03:41:16.180 --> 03:41:19.820]  We should call craft international and ask if they were there. I'm gonna do it right now
[03:41:19.820 --> 03:41:25.580]  Okay, Alex Jones is on the case right now and as far as the the the hats and the boots
[03:41:25.580 --> 03:41:31.300]  The gentleman was referring to I mean the the actual logo that skull logo is a from a comic book character the Punisher
[03:41:31.300 --> 03:41:35.260]  You can buy those t-shirts anywhere, but it is it is a valid point
[03:41:35.260 --> 03:41:40.320]  You can buy those at different places, but Alex Jones like you said is on the case as we also showed though on the pictures
[03:41:41.020 --> 03:41:46.600]  You know SEAL teams have adopted that same Punisher logo and with and you can look at the picture
[03:41:46.600 --> 03:41:51.880]  It looks like there's something up on the forehead of it kind of like it is with the SEAL team 3
[03:41:51.880 --> 03:41:53.880]  I think it is but
[03:41:53.940 --> 03:41:59.060]  Yeah, it's also the demeanor of the guys and the fact that they're standing right next to each other
[03:41:59.060 --> 03:42:03.940]  they both have your pieces in they're definitely together on yeah, they're both on cell phones and and
[03:42:04.820 --> 03:42:07.540]  Both dressed exactly alike with the pants and the shoes
[03:42:07.540 --> 03:42:12.700]  I mean, I don't necessarily think that it's just a coincidence that they went shopping together, right?
[03:42:12.700 --> 03:42:15.420]  I mean, they're there at their besties or
[03:42:17.460 --> 03:42:21.060]  They don't look like they're constituents of Barney Frank
[03:42:23.980 --> 03:42:30.220]  Yeah, but that's that's a very good point caller and like I said Alex is on the case we'll move now to Jim in, Texas
[03:42:33.780 --> 03:42:35.780]  Doing very well
[03:42:35.980 --> 03:42:38.440]  I'm in law enforcement. I really don't want to go into
[03:42:38.440 --> 03:42:44.080]  Where I work, but I just want to say to folks that are out there in law enforcement
[03:42:45.040 --> 03:42:47.040]  it's time to get off your asses and
[03:42:48.280 --> 03:42:54.600]  What's going on right now is real it's not fake I think a lot of people out there are really scared
[03:42:55.560 --> 03:42:57.560]  But we didn't gain our freedom
[03:42:58.120 --> 03:42:59.760]  by being scared and
[03:42:59.760 --> 03:43:04.720]  I just want you guys to know there's a lot of people out here that do know what are going on and we're aware
[03:43:04.720 --> 03:43:11.520]  And we listen daily so okay now. Let me ask you this Jim. You know you say you want people to get off the fence
[03:43:11.520 --> 03:43:13.200]  What would you recommend to an officer?
[03:43:13.200 --> 03:43:18.040]  You know who maybe he sees things going on, but he's afraid that you know talk about it or share the information
[03:43:19.040 --> 03:43:24.660]  Well, I just think that people get to understand that there are such things as lawful orders and unlawful orders
[03:43:24.660 --> 03:43:28.280]  And we still do under the Constitution in United States I
[03:43:29.120 --> 03:43:32.480]  Just don't understand how we can have people that taken old
[03:43:32.480 --> 03:43:38.440]  To defend the Constitution in our country and go every day about trying to tear it apart
[03:43:38.440 --> 03:43:45.120]  I don't understand this you know nobody's waking up. It's uh you know you take an oath for a reason you become
[03:43:45.760 --> 03:43:49.560]  You know you do your job. I've been doing this 21 years combined and
[03:43:51.600 --> 03:43:53.480]  It's pretty sad
[03:43:53.480 --> 03:43:55.840]  It's sad for me to see people that are out there that just
[03:43:56.480 --> 03:44:02.240]  Basically understand what's going on. They're quiet because they're scared and it's understandable, but if you're gonna be scared
[03:44:02.240 --> 03:44:06.200]  You're gonna lose your rights, and that's just what it comes down to so I just want to thank you guys
[03:44:06.200 --> 03:44:11.400]  I listen to you daily. I respect what you do. You're the real deal. I don't care when anyone thinks out there
[03:44:11.880 --> 03:44:15.120]  Go back and do the research if you don't believe it google it look it up yourself
[03:44:15.120 --> 03:44:19.440]  There's plenty of places to find it if you want to know you'll find it exactly well
[03:44:19.440 --> 03:44:21.720]  Thanks for making that point you know it was
[03:44:22.200 --> 03:44:28.680]  It's coming up to just about two weeks ago last two weeks two Saturdays ago, and jakari, and I went to this
[03:44:28.680 --> 03:44:34.800]  Gun rally anti-gun rally moms demand action. Yeah in Austin and had the Austin police chief there
[03:44:34.800 --> 03:44:38.000]  And I was surprised now. This is a guy who has
[03:44:38.520 --> 03:44:43.640]  Went immediately after that meeting he went up to Washington. He was meeting with Joe Biden and a lot of other
[03:44:44.200 --> 03:44:48.080]  Police chiefs who are trying to take away gun rights and so he's very much
[03:44:48.440 --> 03:44:53.960]  Hooked into that gun control crowd, and I was surprised to see him actually take on very strongly
[03:44:55.120 --> 03:44:57.560]  constitutional sheriffs and the
[03:44:57.560 --> 03:45:04.160]  What he was putting forth was essentially not a division of power that we have in the Constitution not
[03:45:06.120 --> 03:45:08.920]  Rights that are reserved to states and rights that are reserved to
[03:45:09.440 --> 03:45:11.200]  Sheriff's as we see in the Constitution
[03:45:11.200 --> 03:45:13.800]  But what he was trying to put forth was a very rigid
[03:45:14.160 --> 03:45:20.880]  Hierarchy with a federal government at the top and the Supreme Court at the very top of that basically saying well if the Supreme Court
[03:45:20.880 --> 03:45:24.840]  Says that the Second Amendment doesn't have any meaning then you better do what it says
[03:45:24.840 --> 03:45:30.840]  Yes, you're gonna enforce the laws as they are passed no matter how unconstitutional. They may be that's right
[03:45:30.840 --> 03:45:33.000]  what he was saying is you know that the the
[03:45:33.720 --> 03:45:36.960]  legislature passes the laws the Supreme Court decides if they're
[03:45:37.240 --> 03:45:43.080]  Constitutional and then the executive branch which you and law enforcement are part of you execute that that's not true
[03:45:43.440 --> 03:45:47.320]  You have a division of power between even those three federal branches
[03:45:47.320 --> 03:45:51.360]  And there's a division of power between the federal government and the states and between
[03:45:51.360 --> 03:45:54.960]  Those two entities and the people and he was trying to criticize
[03:45:55.560 --> 03:46:00.960]  Sheriffs who are elected officials and these police chiefs are not elected officials
[03:46:00.960 --> 03:46:06.960]  So those battle lines are being drawn and that's that's something that's going to be coming down the pipe because this is somebody that's very hooked
[03:46:06.960 --> 03:46:09.800]  In to the Democrat hierarchy that's coming after gun control
[03:46:09.800 --> 03:46:14.800]  They are going to get aggressive in terms of criticizing sheriffs, and we're gonna be there defending them right
[03:46:14.800 --> 03:46:17.280]  And it's like a whole click here in Austin
[03:46:17.280 --> 03:46:24.280]  It's the police chief and the mayor and the the councilman is like the whole click in the in the heart of, Texas
[03:46:24.280 --> 03:46:26.800]  I guess you would say cuz I see so many comments and people are well
[03:46:26.800 --> 03:46:28.080]  Thank God I live in Texas
[03:46:28.080 --> 03:46:32.460]  Where we where we have common sense like these people trying to take away your gun just like the people in New York
[03:46:32.760 --> 03:46:36.480]  People in California just banned plastic bags here in Austin. Yeah
[03:46:37.040 --> 03:46:41.880]  This is like Bloomberg wannabes. I mean yeah, or I say screw your bag ban
[03:46:41.880 --> 03:46:45.480]  You know I make those people so mad like we can't get plastic bags
[03:46:45.480 --> 03:46:47.440]  We'll go to our next caller in just one second
[03:46:47.440 --> 03:46:50.120]  But we can't get plastic bags here in the city of Austin anymore
[03:46:50.120 --> 03:46:52.760]  So what I do is I get my grocery cart
[03:46:52.760 --> 03:46:56.040]  And I go to the checkout line with all my stuff and then like sir
[03:46:56.040 --> 03:46:59.060]  Do you do you want to purchase a bag I say no put everything back in the cart
[03:46:59.060 --> 03:47:01.600]  And then like what and then I roll it outside
[03:47:01.600 --> 03:47:05.560]  And I have this big bin in my trunk that I put all my stuff in so that's how you defeat
[03:47:05.560 --> 03:47:08.560]  That's a bad because you can still get bags. You just have to pay for them now
[03:47:08.560 --> 03:47:13.520]  I mean you can go buy as many plastic bags you want. They just want you to pay for them. That's what it is
[03:47:13.520 --> 03:47:17.600]  Yeah, yeah, all right. We'll move on to the next call. We have Tom in, Missouri
[03:47:21.600 --> 03:47:23.600]  Hello Tom
[03:47:27.080 --> 03:47:33.080]  Thank you, sir listener, I'm retired military kudos to Alex, but the crew doesn't get enough
[03:47:34.160 --> 03:47:36.160]  Compliments you guys are doing a fantastic
[03:47:36.160 --> 03:47:44.000]  Especially the guys behind the camera the radio guys have been working some serious hours. Just this past week. I could only imagine the things
[03:47:44.000 --> 03:47:46.660]  You guys go through to get this out, but anyway
[03:47:47.800 --> 03:47:52.360]  based on what the request was calling in about what you think's going on the
[03:47:53.400 --> 03:47:54.920]  bombing I
[03:47:54.920 --> 03:47:56.240]  think that
[03:47:56.240 --> 03:48:02.240]  It's just a diversion. I do think it's a false flag, and I believe that they have many many more events planned
[03:48:02.240 --> 03:48:08.240]  Are you saw Feinstein who these these events are going to continue? Oh? Yeah? We have that clip somewhere
[03:48:08.240 --> 03:48:12.700]  It's it's somewhere, but don't don't worry about getting it right now. Go ahead sir. It wouldn't surprise me
[03:48:12.700 --> 03:48:14.700]  If they had something to do with this
[03:48:15.400 --> 03:48:21.840]  Factory exploding in Texas and the rice in and probably you know 100 other things that they got already set up
[03:48:21.840 --> 03:48:25.480]  Did they can put in effect yeah and speaking of the Ryerson sir not to cut you off?
[03:48:25.480 --> 03:48:28.480]  But we'd had that interview where Alex did the interview with John McAfee
[03:48:28.480 --> 03:48:36.040]  Back in January and McAfee said he had you know tips that they were making a good amount of Ryerson
[03:48:36.040 --> 03:48:38.040]  Here's Alex. I'm glad you mentioned that
[03:48:38.760 --> 03:48:40.960]  I'm like salacious crumbs sitting on your shoulder here
[03:48:42.080 --> 03:48:44.080]  I'm glad you mentioned that
[03:48:44.440 --> 03:48:49.120]  Because an Elvis impersonator Democratic Party guy. That's a cutout
[03:48:49.640 --> 03:48:55.260]  That's just like some cover. Oh this guy the Elvis impersonator sent the Ryerson
[03:48:55.260 --> 03:48:59.240]  I mean give me a break man. Give me a break. Yeah, yeah
[03:49:00.240 --> 03:49:03.120]  Anyway, you can you can find that the interview with John McAfee
[03:49:03.120 --> 03:49:06.800]  I believe it has been reposted, but if you are a prison planet member you can also find it
[03:49:06.800 --> 03:49:10.720]  I believe it was January 4th of this year. We have to move quick Tom. Thank you for your call
[03:49:10.760 --> 03:49:12.920]  We'll move now to Dylan in Utah
[03:49:16.880 --> 03:49:18.880]  Hello Dylan Dylan
[03:49:19.000 --> 03:49:21.840]  Hello, yes, go ahead. Oh hey
[03:49:21.840 --> 03:49:25.320]  I just want to say thanks for everything you guys are doing
[03:49:25.320 --> 03:49:29.000]  I don't know if you guys had already covered it, but yahoo is headlining
[03:49:29.880 --> 03:49:36.000]  President Obama's reaction respond to the defeated gun bill. Yeah, I've printed out some articles, but go ahead
[03:49:36.000 --> 03:49:37.600]  I'll see if I can find it
[03:49:37.600 --> 03:49:40.800]  Um I just wanted to say that it is a small victory
[03:49:40.800 --> 03:49:42.120]  I know it's not over
[03:49:42.120 --> 03:49:47.480]  But people need to know that info wars is making a difference with a lot of people out there that
[03:49:47.760 --> 03:49:51.360]  Say that it it doesn't really do much of anything to talk about it
[03:49:51.360 --> 03:49:58.080]  But it's clearly getting through he does make a a really silly point saying that 90% of Americans
[03:49:58.600 --> 03:49:59.520]  supported that
[03:49:59.520 --> 03:50:05.200]  Yes, where did they get these numbers from because they say the same thing when we go to these anti-gun rallies most Americans
[03:50:05.200 --> 03:50:07.440]  And they'll say you know usually they'll they'll lowball
[03:50:07.440 --> 03:50:11.780]  They won't say 90% like Obama does but they'll say like 60 plus percent of Americans
[03:50:12.320 --> 03:50:15.680]  Favor these these new gun restrictions and to back up his point
[03:50:15.680 --> 03:50:20.220]  I have this article from Politico gun control president Obama's biggest loss
[03:50:20.220 --> 03:50:24.320]  And I want everybody to know that this is going to be a ongoing fight
[03:50:24.320 --> 03:50:27.360]  It's not just we beat him this time because he even admits. He wants to keep going after it
[03:50:27.360 --> 03:50:30.920]  Here's a quote from Obama background checks will happen
[03:50:30.920 --> 03:50:36.740]  He added minutes after the vote this outcome is a delay not a defeat, and that's the same thing for us
[03:50:36.740 --> 03:50:41.600]  It's just they're delaying their next move. We have to keep going after these people so just enjoy it
[03:50:41.600 --> 03:50:47.160]  We need to get off of the defense and we need to start playing offense exactly say we won this round
[03:50:47.160 --> 03:50:51.560]  But we're gonna take back exactly we have to go to break and we'll come back with Dylan in Utah
[03:51:08.400 --> 03:51:10.760]  In the last two years alone the u.s.
[03:51:10.760 --> 03:51:16.120]  Has seen huge losses to our food supply in 2011 storms and floods raged across the u.s.
[03:51:16.120 --> 03:51:18.640]  Costing us 20 billion in lost crops alone in

[03:54:15.920 --> 03:54:19.040]  All right, we're coming back and we were just talking to Dylan in Utah
[03:54:19.040 --> 03:54:25.160]  And he was telling us that he believed that the press and the coverage has really made a difference on the Second Amendment fight
[03:54:25.160 --> 03:54:27.160]  I believe it did too and
[03:54:27.960 --> 03:54:29.840]  What we need to look at is though
[03:54:29.840 --> 03:54:34.840]  We're still got a fight going on with CISPA, and that's going on right now, and I tell you folks
[03:54:35.520 --> 03:54:38.240]  Republican House voted on that by a large margin
[03:54:38.680 --> 03:54:43.080]  But we can still defeat this thing and it is something that if they're if they're gonna be able to
[03:54:43.080 --> 03:54:49.480]  Violate your Fourth Amendment rights in the virtual sphere. They're gonna do it in the physical sphere as well
[03:54:49.520 --> 03:54:55.240]  We've already seen it at the airport when we know that the whole purpose of this false flag attack is to get TSA out of
[03:54:55.240 --> 03:54:59.760]  The airports and out of the streets, so we need to start fighting this CISPA thing right now
[03:54:59.760 --> 03:55:04.240]  So all you guys who are fighting for the gun rights and just one don't rest on your laurels
[03:55:04.440 --> 03:55:08.280]  Get active right now and stop these assaults on the Fourth Amendment
[03:55:08.280 --> 03:55:15.320]  And which will eventually be on the First Amendment as well, and it's real important that we keep our free speech and our privacy out there
[03:55:16.160 --> 03:55:18.120]  Exactly now. I want all of our viewers
[03:55:18.120 --> 03:55:22.120]  Don't we only have about five minutes left in in this segment because at three o'clock central

[03:55:41.000 --> 03:55:43.000]  Dylan you are on the air
[03:55:43.720 --> 03:55:48.760]  Yeah, I'm just gonna make it short and then get off the line to free up the line here, but
[03:55:49.840 --> 03:55:53.800]  Also, I wanted to let everybody know that you know you got to understand that
[03:55:54.840 --> 03:55:59.040]  Alex Jones doesn't just pull all this stuff from his rear end. I mean he gives you the tools
[03:55:59.400 --> 03:56:01.400]  He gives you all the evidence you need
[03:56:01.400 --> 03:56:06.400]  A lot of these other plate a lot of these other than you know media sources. They don't do that
[03:56:06.400 --> 03:56:12.240]  They don't give you the sources so before you start arguing that no Alex is a shill
[03:56:12.240 --> 03:56:15.680]  He's a you know this and that he's a misinformation
[03:56:15.840 --> 03:56:22.920]  You know agent he provides everything there you just need to look into it, and I just want to say I appreciate and
[03:56:23.600 --> 03:56:28.000]  Love you guys all right. Thank you dealing not to jump quick Zach in, Kentucky
[03:56:28.000 --> 03:56:30.000]  My
[03:56:30.640 --> 03:56:34.120]  My question is you guys as well with the Boston Marathon attack
[03:56:34.720 --> 03:56:38.200]  What do you guys see happening for other sporting events or other?
[03:56:38.720 --> 03:56:40.720]  large population events
[03:56:41.160 --> 03:56:47.680]  Coming up now all across the country. Well. You know at the at the Super Bowl. They're already doing TSA checks
[03:56:47.680 --> 03:56:49.200]  I'm pretty sure that's going to expand out
[03:56:49.200 --> 03:56:54.200]  I went to my niece's graduation a couple years ago, and it wasn't TSA, but they were checking people's bags
[03:56:54.200 --> 03:56:59.500]  A women's purse is people's backpacks get to get in a graduation, and then you also had to have a ticket
[03:56:59.500 --> 03:57:02.120]  You know back when I graduated you just walked in the building now
[03:57:02.120 --> 03:57:05.240]  You have to have a ticket and you get your back search David Knight well
[03:57:05.240 --> 03:57:08.360]  They already mentioned that they're going to start cracking down in all the sporting events
[03:57:08.440 --> 03:57:12.280]  That's gonna be that was on on sports Center the other day the guys are talking about Jen
[03:57:12.280 --> 03:57:15.000]  Napolitano says we need to have more security at these events go ahead
[03:57:15.000 --> 03:57:19.760]  Well they went to the sporting events first if you recall I mean they it's at the football games
[03:57:19.760 --> 03:57:25.920]  It should see TSA coming out and Alex has talked about that many times about how they would do that and of course
[03:57:25.920 --> 03:57:27.920]  We saw in the dark night. You know they have the very
[03:57:28.440 --> 03:57:34.740]  Striking visual of the football stadium that's being exploded and that's where they so they've been coming at the sports events
[03:57:35.200 --> 03:57:39.560]  First priority and now we see this at a sporting event, so they're gonna roll it out
[03:57:39.960 --> 03:57:42.720]  Intensely and then they will that I think that's their next stage
[03:57:42.720 --> 03:57:45.880]  And then they're gonna go from there to the roads to the shopping centers
[03:57:45.880 --> 03:57:49.720]  That's one thing, but they'll probably have to have another event before they get it to that point
[03:57:49.720 --> 03:57:53.120]  No, thank you for your call Zach. We have to move quick to Dale in Montana
[03:57:53.880 --> 03:58:01.000]  Yeah, I was calling about the guy you have a picture of that's carrying the radiation detector. Yes, sir
[03:58:01.280 --> 03:58:06.880]  Yeah, he went on Wolf Blitzer and his name is dr. David King if you go to
[03:58:09.160 --> 03:58:14.220]  Let's see here the situation room for yesterday about 635 Eastern Time
[03:58:14.220 --> 03:58:19.980]  He was on there with him, and he claims that he left the race before the explosion situation
[03:58:20.660 --> 03:58:24.140]  Repeat repeat how we can find that again situation room with Wolf Blitzer

[04:00:25.140 --> 04:00:37.740]  All right and welcome back to the Alex Jones radio show we are in heavy overdrive myself and Dave and night hosting you guys
[04:00:37.740 --> 04:00:44.420]  You can call us at eight seven seven seven eight nine Alex. That is eight seven seven seven eight nine two five three nine
[04:00:44.420 --> 04:00:47.260]  We will be taking more calls up pretty much this whole hour
[04:00:47.260 --> 04:00:56.140]  But we do have a few clips we want to throw to in the meantime do we have that Harry Reid clip ready guys? Okay?
[04:00:56.140 --> 04:00:57.940]  Okay, the guys are getting ready for their clips
[04:00:57.940 --> 04:01:03.500]  So if we have anybody on on call you can give us a call and we can put those on the board
[04:01:03.500 --> 04:01:05.940]  But in the meantime Dave and I know what are you looking at right there?
[04:01:06.380 --> 04:01:11.060]  Well, we just had a caller just before we went to the top of the hour telling us that the guy holding the
[04:01:11.060 --> 04:01:18.620]  Device I guess was a radiation detector and that his name was dr. David King. He's on the Wolf Blitzer situation room yesterday
[04:01:18.620 --> 04:01:23.660]  I just looked that up. I haven't seen the video yet, but the subtitle to it says that he was a surgeon and
[04:01:24.660 --> 04:01:26.660]  That he'd finished running the Boston Marathon
[04:01:26.780 --> 04:01:30.860]  Maybe that's not the picture I'm thinking of that so we'll have to still take a look at that
[04:01:30.860 --> 04:01:32.460]  But we don't have anything conclusive on that yet
[04:01:32.460 --> 04:01:38.220]  But we're going to be having a press conference coming up at 4 p.m.. And we're going to be commenting on that so guys stick around
[04:01:38.220 --> 04:01:41.680]  Okay, and we are ready with that video, so let's take a look at that right now
[04:01:42.860 --> 04:01:46.380]  We can keep them off the streets. We should keep them off the streets
[04:01:47.420 --> 04:01:53.900]  In the 1920s organized crime was committing murders with machine guns. We've seen them in the movies
[04:01:55.140 --> 04:01:57.140]  Valentine Valentine's Day Massacre
[04:01:58.060 --> 04:02:02.100]  So Congress dramatically limited the sale and transfer of machine guns
[04:02:03.020 --> 04:02:05.020]  long time ago
[04:02:05.020 --> 04:02:07.580]  as a result machine guns
[04:02:08.260 --> 04:02:14.500]  Basically disappeared from the streets. No it didn't they're in movies, but not private citizens had them
[04:02:16.100 --> 04:02:21.540]  We can and should make the same common-sense approach to safeguard Americans from modern weapons of war
[04:02:22.860 --> 04:02:24.580]  assault weapons
[04:02:24.580 --> 04:02:29.420]  That's why I will vote for Diane Feinstein's assault weapons ban
[04:02:29.420 --> 04:02:37.420]  Because we must strike a better balance between the right to defend ourselves and the right of every child in America to grow up safe
[04:02:37.420 --> 04:02:39.420]  from gun violence
[04:02:40.100 --> 04:02:44.820]  I'll vote for the ban because maintaining a law and order is more important than satisfying
[04:02:45.440 --> 04:02:46.860]  conspiracy theories
[04:02:46.860 --> 04:02:52.320]  Who believe in black helicopters and false flags? I'm going to find that black helicopter clip
[04:02:52.320 --> 04:02:59.600]  Mm-hmm and I'll vote for the ban because saving the lives of police officers young and old and innocent civilians
[04:02:59.720 --> 04:03:03.440]  Young and old is more important preventing imagined tyranny
[04:03:04.640 --> 04:03:08.200]  Imagined tyranny so high-capacity magazines clips
[04:03:09.200 --> 04:03:11.200]  That's what I call them
[04:03:12.000 --> 04:03:15.600]  You don't know what you're talking about a large ammunition magazines is similar
[04:03:16.880 --> 04:03:19.200]  These large clips are designed to kill
[04:03:19.200 --> 04:03:20.880]  not
[04:03:20.880 --> 04:03:24.640]  To kill a deer or a duck or any other game large or small
[04:03:26.000 --> 04:03:31.160]  They're designed to kill humans living breathing human beings
[04:03:32.880 --> 04:03:40.080]  Okay guys, where do you start yeah, hold that thought David Knight just give some some directions to the guys out there
[04:03:40.080 --> 04:03:44.720]  I know I'm pulling Alex here. Can you guys go into the show the nightly news for last week?
[04:03:44.720 --> 04:03:46.240]  It's probably Thursday or Friday
[04:03:46.240 --> 04:03:52.080]  I think it was Friday and there's a clip called black helicopter crowd. It's me talking about Joe Biden and
[04:03:52.600 --> 04:03:57.040]  How he says you know the black helicopter crowd there are no black helicopters and David Knight
[04:03:57.040 --> 04:04:03.520]  You know right here did a a very long in-depth report about black helicopters minds only about two or three minutes
[04:04:03.520 --> 04:04:06.960]  So if we can find that but David Knight you seem like you have something to say about that man
[04:04:06.960 --> 04:04:10.140]  I don't know. There's so much garbage that came out of there
[04:04:10.140 --> 04:04:15.120]  I mean, you know even going back to a coast to the term assault rifle, okay, you know
[04:04:15.120 --> 04:04:17.520]  They that that's a vague undefined term
[04:04:17.720 --> 04:04:22.240]  But and his his confusion of clips and that's where they in the fact that clips are designed to kill
[04:04:22.240 --> 04:04:25.760]  You know, I mean it's well aren't bullets designed to take down the target
[04:04:25.760 --> 04:04:26.240]  That's right
[04:04:26.240 --> 04:04:30.160]  But let's start with the very first thing he said, you know that they got rid of machine guns
[04:04:30.440 --> 04:04:37.280]  Because of a law that they passed no the reason people were shooting each other on the streets in the 1920s was because of alcohol
[04:04:37.280 --> 04:04:39.040]  provision they don't
[04:04:39.040 --> 04:04:46.160]  80% of the gun violence according to the Chicago chief of police is because of drug gangs shooting it out with each other
[04:04:46.360 --> 04:04:50.040]  Just like Al Capone did and the reason you got people that you know
[04:04:50.040 --> 04:04:52.600]  They can they can do all the bands that they want to on
[04:04:53.240 --> 04:04:57.760]  Machine guns, but that didn't stop Al Capone. He didn't care that banned alcohol
[04:04:58.000 --> 04:05:01.960]  No, I didn't care if they're gonna ban machine guns and you know a pretty boy Floyd
[04:05:01.960 --> 04:05:04.320]  And these guys are gonna rob banks the machine guns or whatever
[04:05:04.320 --> 04:05:10.880]  But you know the bottom line is it was prohibition that was causing the crime there and it's prohibition that is responsible for
[04:05:11.080 --> 04:05:18.340]  Things being shot up on the street and government will always make another mistake before they correct the original problem
[04:05:18.340 --> 04:05:24.260]  And that's what we see here with this this attempt to try to destroy the Second Amendment and it is not an imagined
[04:05:24.360 --> 04:05:30.800]  tyranny the Second Amendment in our Constitution was written because our founders had experienced a tyranny and
[04:05:30.800 --> 04:05:38.540]  They wrote the Constitution but safeguards in there to keep that from happening again, and it's and that's why we have it there
[04:05:38.680 --> 04:05:42.400]  They had come for the guns at Lexington and Concord and that started the American Revolution
[04:05:42.680 --> 04:05:45.480]  They did it here in Texas that started the Texas Revolution
[04:05:46.200 --> 04:05:51.360]  you don't take away people's right to protect themselves and to exercise a
[04:05:51.840 --> 04:05:59.380]  Check on the power of government, and that's a peaceful check as long as the citizens have weapons and the government knows that it's like
[04:05:59.380 --> 04:06:00.660]  to
[04:06:00.660 --> 04:06:05.720]  Two countries that are well-armed in a strong position and they're not one's not going to initiate a war against the other one
[04:06:06.020 --> 04:06:11.540]  It's that kind of a check. It's really a better chance for peace, and if you're unilaterally disarmed
[04:06:11.540 --> 04:06:11.860]  Yeah
[04:06:11.860 --> 04:06:17.460]  Like I said leaves on the nightly news a couple nights ago if we want to if we use the same logic
[04:06:17.460 --> 04:06:23.060]  And we say we don't want the threat of nuclear war. Let's just declare the US a nuke-free zone right absolutely
[04:06:23.060 --> 04:06:27.540]  We don't have anything to shoot back at you, North Korea, so yeah, just they'll leave us alone now
[04:06:27.540 --> 04:06:30.020]  Let's go to our calls Jordan in California
[04:06:33.240 --> 04:06:35.100]  Hello Jordan
[04:06:35.100 --> 04:06:40.220]  My cousin just called me less than an hour ago. There has been a bomb threat at Cal State, Los Angeles
[04:06:41.140 --> 04:06:46.140]  Cal State, Los Angeles can we get on that guy's please they are there. They're evacuating the school
[04:06:46.140 --> 04:06:47.940]  They've never done this in my four years there
[04:06:47.940 --> 04:06:52.980]  It's been never been this big my cousin called me to tell me that they're closing down the school because of a bomb threat
[04:06:52.980 --> 04:06:54.980]  Okay, you say you attend the school?
[04:06:54.980 --> 04:07:00.620]  I attend the school yes, but I don't go till later tonight my cousin called me to let me know

[04:07:05.380 --> 04:07:07.380]  It's both because of a bomb threat
[04:07:07.620 --> 04:07:09.700]  Classes been canceled for today, okay
[04:07:09.700 --> 04:07:14.000]  Do you know anything about the number of bombs or suspects or anything like that?
[04:07:14.000 --> 04:07:19.540]  No again like this isn't this is barely been happening within an hour like there's no news reports on this whatsoever
[04:07:19.540 --> 04:07:24.900]  This is all very like live happening right now, so I have no information except just to get it out there
[04:07:24.900 --> 04:07:28.240]  Okay, all right, sir. We'll definitely we'll definitely look into that
[04:07:28.980 --> 04:07:32.580]  Thank you for your call. We'll move on problem. Thank you. We'll move on to
[04:07:33.380 --> 04:07:36.360]  All right, thank you info boy for life. I like that right there
[04:07:36.360 --> 04:07:40.760]  I just let me know if you find any information on that we'll move on to Dustin in Tennessee
[04:07:43.420 --> 04:07:48.500]  First of all I want to say I appreciate it and for all the info that you provide I have a
[04:07:49.180 --> 04:07:53.020]  Quite a few points that I want to spit out as quick as possible first
[04:07:53.020 --> 04:07:56.780]  I was right there with y'all as soon as I found out about the Boston thing
[04:07:56.780 --> 04:08:02.340]  I jumped on the HLN started posting links to y'all's a web page of course
[04:08:02.340 --> 04:08:06.340]  They immediately started bringing them down and as soon as I brought it up for bringing them down
[04:08:06.340 --> 04:08:11.140]  Well, then they stopped they stopped bringing them down of course because then they know oh look
[04:08:11.940 --> 04:08:14.960]  They he's someone sees it. These are being brought down
[04:08:15.740 --> 04:08:17.620]  Certainly not so they're gonna
[04:08:17.620 --> 04:08:24.740]  Have an attention towards death well separate from all of a couple of years ago you y'all probably remember this
[04:08:24.740 --> 04:08:26.740]  They had a a couple of pairs
[04:08:27.380 --> 04:08:29.340]  Put quotes around that
[04:08:29.340 --> 04:08:35.260]  There was a terrace that at a drone planes that they were planned on blowing up the Pentagon
[04:08:35.540 --> 04:08:41.260]  Well, how did they know about all of this, but they had no clue about this Boston ball at all
[04:08:43.260 --> 04:08:47.540]  Well that's always the question how do they miss something you know let's talk about 9-eleven
[04:08:47.540 --> 04:08:52.460]  As big as 9-eleven you know they can all follow these little mom-and-pop bomb pots
[04:08:52.460 --> 04:08:57.700]  And you know little shoot-em-ups that never happened, but something is big and grand you know you know the Boston
[04:08:57.700 --> 04:09:00.540]  I mean it definitely injured a lot of people, but as far as taking life it
[04:09:00.540 --> 04:09:05.180]  You know the numbers weren't that significant even though we definitely mourned the loss of the people who did die
[04:09:05.180 --> 04:09:11.540]  But that is a question why do you think that David Knight well the police chief has said that in a part of a press
[04:09:11.540 --> 04:09:15.020]  Conference he said that they had more people than they'd ever had at this event
[04:09:15.020 --> 04:09:20.500]  And he said they were particularly focused on the finish line, and so the question is why is that?
[04:09:21.540 --> 04:09:23.900]  Especially when they will not confirm or deny
[04:09:24.060 --> 04:09:29.740]  Maybe they have denied that they had a bomb drill going, but he would not confirm or deny that with Dan
[04:09:29.740 --> 04:09:33.160]  But on D initially, I don't know if they have subsequently changed their story on that
[04:09:33.580 --> 04:09:37.780]  But we see all the people that were there we see a tremendous number of people
[04:09:38.060 --> 04:09:42.580]  There and we have an eyewitness report saying that they were telling people not to be afraid
[04:09:42.580 --> 04:09:46.020]  It was just a drill the Mobile, Alabama University Mobile
[04:09:46.700 --> 04:09:48.460]  Track coach yes was there
[04:09:48.460 --> 04:09:54.540]  And he said he's run a lot of these events and never seen this kind of security never seen bomb drills never seen bomb sniffing
[04:09:54.540 --> 04:10:00.160]  Dogs at the starting and at the finishing line the bottom line is is that these people cannot keep you safe
[04:10:00.700 --> 04:10:03.300]  If they can't if they weren't planting the bomb
[04:10:03.500 --> 04:10:07.780]  If they weren't doing a drill to kind of cover for the bomb as we saw happen with
[04:10:07.900 --> 04:10:10.580]  September 11th and so many other events as we've talked about
[04:10:10.580 --> 04:10:12.420]  If
[04:10:12.420 --> 04:10:14.060]  If they couldn't do it there
[04:10:14.060 --> 04:10:21.020]  Then they're not going to be able to protect you you should not give up and surrender your liberties for people who basically are not
[04:10:21.020 --> 04:10:25.460]  Capable of delivering on their promise of security exactly. Thank you for your call Justin
[04:10:25.460 --> 04:10:32.000]  We do have that black helicopter clip ready to dovetail what Harry Reid said and what Joe Biden has said about black helicopters
[04:10:32.000 --> 04:10:34.000]  So let's go ahead and roll that footage
[04:10:34.000 --> 04:10:40.280]  Let me read some of the things they're saying about background checks
[04:10:40.280 --> 04:10:46.720]  They say quote we the federal government want to put every private private firearms
[04:10:47.160 --> 04:10:53.720]  Transaction right under the thumb of the federal government and keep all those names in a massive federal registry
[04:10:55.120 --> 04:10:57.120]  Kind of scary man
[04:10:57.120 --> 04:10:59.480]  Black helicopter crowd really is upset
[04:10:59.480 --> 04:11:04.900]  I'm jakari Jackson with an infowars news bulletin vice president Joe Biden is once again
[04:11:05.240 --> 04:11:12.600]  Criticizing those concerned about their Second Amendment rights calling them quote the black helicopter crowd now infowars has well documented
[04:11:12.600 --> 04:11:16.320]  How black helicopters are very much real and active in the United States?
[04:11:16.940 --> 04:11:18.940]  Helicopters and the sound of gunfire
[04:11:21.200 --> 04:11:23.720]  Neighborhood it's a joint military training
[04:11:23.720 --> 04:11:30.280]  January 24th local police also military as someone shots a video of some of these choppers
[04:11:30.520 --> 04:11:36.400]  Military-style choppers if you see military helicopters flying low over Minneapolis do not be alarmed
[04:11:36.400 --> 04:11:38.400]  They are training in an urban environment
[04:11:38.720 --> 04:11:44.560]  The US Special Operations Command will be conducting these exercises until the beginning of September now
[04:11:44.560 --> 04:11:50.840]  Let's take a look at a different part of Biden's speech where he says not only is there no FBI database of firearm purchases
[04:11:50.840 --> 04:11:56.920]  according to him the FBI stretch purchase information immediately after processing and within
[04:11:57.360 --> 04:11:59.360]  24 hours of
[04:12:00.600 --> 04:12:02.600]  Being told
[04:12:03.040 --> 04:12:05.040]  That you can sell that gun
[04:12:05.520 --> 04:12:07.520]  the FBI must
[04:12:07.720 --> 04:12:12.560]  Destroy the information there is no record cap
[04:12:12.560 --> 04:12:18.120]  And this reporter may have been fooled by Biden's rhetoric had it not been for these articles
[04:12:18.120 --> 04:12:22.400]  Even Congress wants to know what the NSA is doing with its two billion dollar
[04:12:22.400 --> 04:12:27.080]  Utah spy Center ATF to spy on gun owners via massive database
[04:12:27.480 --> 04:12:30.200]  Big sis snitch program to help enforce gun control
[04:12:30.840 --> 04:12:34.920]  US to let spy agencies scour Americans finances and
[04:12:35.480 --> 04:12:42.280]  Utah welcomes NSA mega Snoop Center, but you say well none of those were the FBI we can still trust the FBI, right?
[04:12:42.280 --> 04:12:44.720]  Well, let's take a look at these articles
[04:12:44.720 --> 04:12:51.760]  FBI caught line to spy on reporters FBI caught line about carrier IQ spying and
[04:12:52.280 --> 04:13:00.480]  FBI made up threats at peace rally lied to Congress to justify spying activity and just in case you think Biden misspoke like
[04:13:00.480 --> 04:13:04.160]  Mrs. Clinton when she misspoke about having to dodge sniper fire
[04:13:04.280 --> 04:13:07.760]  Let's take a look at these clips of Biden saying he did not vote for war
[04:13:07.960 --> 04:13:12.320]  They talked about this great recession if it fell out of the sky like oh my goodness
[04:13:12.320 --> 04:13:17.760]  Where did it come from it came from this man voting to put two wars in a credit card?
[04:13:18.120 --> 04:13:22.440]  to at the same time put a prescription drug benefit in the credit card and a
[04:13:23.160 --> 04:13:29.320]  Trillion dollar tax cut for very wealthy. I was there I voted against him. I said no we can't afford that I was there
[04:13:29.320 --> 04:13:31.320]  I voted against them
[04:13:32.160 --> 04:13:34.160]  All right, that's enough guys
[04:13:34.200 --> 04:13:39.140]  Convinced you like so there you go the the black helicopters there. That was just a short piece David
[04:13:39.140 --> 04:13:44.120]  You made that piece how many examples were there? Oh there was five or six and they were at the time
[04:13:44.120 --> 04:13:47.680]  We did it the reason we did that special report was because they were hitting like every couple of days
[04:13:47.760 --> 04:13:49.760]  they were doing it through a
[04:13:50.080 --> 04:13:51.840]  stretch there and
[04:13:51.840 --> 04:13:56.940]  one of the things that was striking about that was they kept telling people well we have to
[04:13:57.680 --> 04:14:02.080]  Train in exactly the scenario as close to the scenario that we're going to execute as possible
[04:14:02.080 --> 04:14:06.760]  So if we're going to attack in a naval target we practice on the water if we're gonna go in the mountains
[04:14:06.760 --> 04:14:11.240]  We practice in the mountains, and so we're practicing for urban warfare. Mm-hmm, but they're doing a joint
[04:14:12.280 --> 04:14:15.480]  Warfare drill with the police yeah, and so you got to say well
[04:14:15.480 --> 04:14:19.520]  So are the Iranian police gonna join in with them when they attack Iran? I don't think so
[04:14:19.520 --> 04:14:24.840]  No, I don't think that was what they were practicing for I think they were practicing not only for an urban warfare
[04:14:24.840 --> 04:14:30.920]  But they were practicing to go into an American city and work with the American police. That's the scenario
[04:14:30.920 --> 04:14:36.440]  They've been training on and that's what I think they're expecting to do and it has happened here house-to-house and Hurricane Katrina
[04:14:36.440 --> 04:14:39.560]  But we'll move back to our calls Mike in, California
[04:14:41.720 --> 04:14:43.720]  Very well
[04:14:45.240 --> 04:14:52.920]  It's really just amazing how we've got these guys right-handed now, and you know just hope that America's either
[04:14:53.480 --> 04:14:55.480]  Opened up real soon
[04:14:55.800 --> 04:14:58.760]  With all that the breaking what I just wanted to call make one point
[04:14:59.040 --> 04:15:05.520]  And it just seems to me that the rights of all Americans are being attacked and the liberties of our you know
[04:15:05.520 --> 04:15:10.120]  The our forefathers fought for you know really been taken away from us before our eyes
[04:15:10.120 --> 04:15:16.320]  But when you really look at it closely it seems like they're really attacking one particular group and that is Christians
[04:15:16.640 --> 04:15:19.320]  and I'm just wondering if you guys could talk about that a little bit and
[04:15:19.880 --> 04:15:21.360]  you know just
[04:15:21.360 --> 04:15:28.400]  What you foresee happenings to Christians in the near future just based on some of the laws that they started talking about
[04:15:29.160 --> 04:15:29.880]  Well, yeah
[04:15:29.880 --> 04:15:31.480]  We see the the religious
[04:15:31.480 --> 04:15:36.300]  execution people saying that uh well we've seen the different documents saying that are even
[04:15:36.800 --> 04:15:39.520]  Evangelical Christians are gonna be your new threat. They're taking
[04:15:40.800 --> 04:15:42.080]  Christian
[04:15:42.080 --> 04:15:47.680]  Practices out of school and people say well. I don't want you know my child having to learn about XYZ religion
[04:15:47.680 --> 04:15:53.160]  That's fine if you don't want any religion in schools, but they're saying let's look at you know the Muslim religion
[04:15:53.160 --> 04:15:58.400]  Let's look at this religion. Let's look at that religion, but no Christian religion, and actually that's a special report
[04:15:58.400 --> 04:16:00.400]  I've been trying to to can oh
[04:16:00.400 --> 04:16:02.680]  Oh a little technical difficulty there
[04:16:02.680 --> 04:16:03.600]  That's a report
[04:16:03.600 --> 04:16:05.320]  I've been trying to complete for the past couple weeks
[04:16:05.320 --> 04:16:09.880]  But you know just a lot of inundated news with the gun stuff and in the bomb threats
[04:16:09.880 --> 04:16:14.480]  But I David Knight what do you think about that well? He was just talking about Christians, and it just broke
[04:16:14.480 --> 04:16:17.360]  I think it was just last week yet another one of these incidents
[04:16:17.360 --> 04:16:22.860]  We had one of course the myak report going all the way back to 2009 that info wars broke
[04:16:23.320 --> 04:16:29.100]  you had a fusion center that was talking about Christians essentially being the number one targets along with
[04:16:29.100 --> 04:16:30.660]  so
[04:16:30.660 --> 04:16:35.780]  We also had a West Point think tank do that a couple of months ago
[04:16:35.780 --> 04:16:38.820]  And then just last week we had a lieutenant colonel Jack rich
[04:16:38.820 --> 04:16:43.620]  And he sent out an email fairly lengthy email to his subordinates
[04:16:43.620 --> 04:16:47.380]  and it was basically going down the talking points of the Southern Poverty Law Center and
[04:16:47.780 --> 04:16:54.740]  In that he identified the American Family Association and the Family Research Council along with the Westboro
[04:16:54.740 --> 04:16:59.340]  Baptists who is a very group that always shows up at military funerals
[04:16:59.780 --> 04:17:06.520]  Yelling and screaming at the soldiers because they because of homosexuality. That's the one thing they're fixated on and and they do
[04:17:07.340 --> 04:17:09.860]  Come forth as as a that's one place
[04:17:09.860 --> 04:17:15.220]  I would agree with the Southern Poverty Law Center on that that group comes across as a genuine hateful group
[04:17:15.220 --> 04:17:22.140]  They don't exhibit the love of Christ or the grace of Christ to anybody that I've seen but to put the AFA and the Family
[04:17:22.140 --> 04:17:26.340]  Research Council into the same category and he told people that they don't share
[04:17:26.820 --> 04:17:32.060]  Army values and you need to be aware of these groups and and this is something that he's putting out there where he's
[04:17:32.380 --> 04:17:35.940]  Condemning groups like the Ku Klux Klan and so forth and so on so when he takes
[04:17:36.340 --> 04:17:40.700]  Some mainstream Christian organizations like the American Family Association the Family Research Council
[04:17:41.380 --> 04:17:46.580]  Throws them in that mix it is just clearly a case of trying to demonize these people all right
[04:17:46.580 --> 04:17:48.540]  Thank you for your call Mike. We just
[04:17:48.540 --> 04:17:52.840]  Confirmed that breaking news story about Cal State is that correct guys can we put that article back up?
[04:17:54.860 --> 04:17:56.740]  Guys are getting it right there
[04:17:56.740 --> 04:18:01.300]  Okay, just one I care there. Yeah, they're a bomb scare in Cal Cal State there
[04:18:01.300 --> 04:18:04.020]  It is Los Angeles Times Cal State LA
[04:18:04.740 --> 04:18:08.620]  evacuated campus closed after bomb threat, so I do believe this is a
[04:18:09.380 --> 04:18:15.860]  Pretty recent news. I guess they don't have any suspects or definitive explosive devices as of yet
[04:18:15.860 --> 04:18:19.460]  But we will definitely keep you up-to-date the best we can on that subject
[04:18:19.460 --> 04:18:23.140]  We'll move on to Jeff in Detroit and Jeff. I have this article here
[04:18:23.140 --> 04:18:29.420]  It talks about the ACLU the Detroit police are dumping homeless people outside of the city
[04:18:29.420 --> 04:18:30.980]  I'll read you the article
[04:18:30.980 --> 04:18:39.100]  The Detroit police practices the Detroit police practice of essentially kidnapping homeless people and abandoning them miles away from the neighborhoods
[04:18:39.100 --> 04:18:41.300]  They know which no means
[04:18:41.300 --> 04:18:48.180]  With no means force a safe return is humane callous and illegal said Sarah Metta
[04:18:48.740 --> 04:18:52.420]  ACLU of Michigan staff attorney have you heard anything about them?
[04:18:52.920 --> 04:18:57.740]  Abducting homeless people and just dropping them outside the city. They did that in the first Rambo movie
[04:18:57.740 --> 04:19:01.700]  They picked him up and they dropped him outside the city. He came back and tore some stuff up
[04:19:01.700 --> 04:19:03.700]  But what do you what do you think about that Jeff?
[04:19:03.700 --> 04:19:10.460]  I think I can hear me. Yes. I think it's pretty par for the course if you remember during the Super Bowl
[04:19:10.460 --> 04:19:13.720]  And the Detroit host of the Super Bowl what they did was they painted
[04:19:14.020 --> 04:19:18.300]  Like an old western scene out of a out of a movie set from Hollywood
[04:19:18.300 --> 04:19:22.660]  they painted fronts of buildings to make them look like they weren't dilapidated and
[04:19:23.980 --> 04:19:29.420]  uninhabited so people that were coming driving into the Super Bowl from the city thought the city looked nice when it was just basically
[04:19:29.420 --> 04:19:35.020]  Fronts on the buildings, but Detroit police are a non-issue. They're cut back so far that you have to
[04:19:35.140 --> 04:19:37.860]  You have to really look to find one down there, especially at nighttime
[04:19:37.980 --> 04:19:43.180]  They don't even want to come out and the streetlights don't come on but I could talk about that for a long time
[04:19:43.180 --> 04:19:46.100]  I think Chris had just said it best when he said Detroit is our first
[04:19:46.180 --> 04:19:53.280]  Sacrificed city of the century that the corporations have come in sucked the resources and left the people to live in squalor, basically
[04:19:53.280 --> 04:20:01.920]  One of my points was Alex always mentions multi-dimensional chess and I think what what happened yesterday was a
[04:20:03.840 --> 04:20:08.160]  They we checkmated them with a pawn they weren't expecting that to happen and
[04:20:08.880 --> 04:20:14.000]  What we're watching now is vampires in the light or a psychopath that's been exposed
[04:20:14.320 --> 04:20:20.160]  They're not used to calling audibles when they do their when they run their ops like this and we're watching them scramble
[04:20:20.160 --> 04:20:24.300]  And they have not had practice with this. So I think what most people need to do is
[04:20:25.960 --> 04:20:27.960]  Alex mentioned earlier that
[04:20:27.960 --> 04:20:33.680]  The search engines are now searching false flags. This is a narrative there can you guys are controlling the narrative?
[04:20:33.680 --> 04:20:40.960]  I think when people when people when their family members come up to them or friends and say have you heard about this Boston thing?
[04:20:40.960 --> 04:20:45.380]  I think people need to step up at this point because it's wide open and say yeah
[04:20:45.380 --> 04:20:51.560]  have you have you looked up false flag have you this is when this is the perfect time to inject this in there because the
[04:20:51.560 --> 04:20:57.120]  Information is readily out there and it's it's in people's mind and this this is the time for this to happen
[04:20:58.160 --> 04:21:01.440]  Exactly. It's gonna be interesting to see what they do with this press conference today at four o'clock
[04:21:01.440 --> 04:21:04.600]  We're gonna stick around and cover that and we're gonna have some analysis after that
[04:21:04.600 --> 04:21:08.680]  But it definitely as you said it put them on essentially calling audibles
[04:21:08.760 --> 04:21:14.680]  Yeah, they had to improvise at the last minute here because I think it kind of definitely put a hitch in their plans
[04:21:14.680 --> 04:21:20.040]  Definitely. Definitely. All right, Jeff. Thank you for your call. We got a we got to move quick to another call
[04:21:20.040 --> 04:21:22.200]  We have a call from Canada V in Canada
[04:21:24.560 --> 04:21:26.120]  Very well
[04:21:26.120 --> 04:21:32.640]  First I want to salute you and mr. Jones for the job that you're doing. It's it's outstanding. I think it's gonna be remember
[04:21:32.640 --> 04:21:38.220]  I know that we are focusing right now on a false flag event that happened in Boston
[04:21:38.220 --> 04:21:41.280]  Everybody wants to talk about but I want to bring two points very quickly
[04:21:41.280 --> 04:21:44.400]  And maybe looking a little bit further to the future
[04:21:45.080 --> 04:21:48.040]  so I think that from all of the
[04:21:48.640 --> 04:21:54.040]  Situation that were occurring lately. It's very clear that at some point there will be additional
[04:21:55.200 --> 04:21:56.880]  actions of
[04:21:56.880 --> 04:22:03.120]  From the from the government side and at some point again, they will move towards something more drastic
[04:22:03.720 --> 04:22:08.180]  Now the idea that I'm trying to present is that we need leadership
[04:22:08.180 --> 04:22:13.900]  Leadership in sense of people in terms of politician and maybe even military
[04:22:13.900 --> 04:22:17.260]  I don't know. But the truth is that no movement can
[04:22:18.060 --> 04:22:23.920]  sustain itself with our leadership and that's why the the government will be focusing on the leaders and try to
[04:22:24.420 --> 04:22:31.460]  Discredit them maybe even remove them and I think we need to start looking for leaders on the political side
[04:22:31.940 --> 04:22:37.420]  on a community side and everywhere else to help us come together when the
[04:22:37.420 --> 04:22:39.420]  situation really becomes
[04:22:39.820 --> 04:22:41.300]  intolerable
[04:22:41.300 --> 04:22:46.420]  Exactly. That's why you need to support your your local politicians your national politicians who are on your side
[04:22:46.420 --> 04:22:53.540]  You know support you realize if you agree with him on everything support guys like Rand Paul and support Ted Cruz on gun bills and and
[04:22:53.540 --> 04:22:55.020]  Things such as that. I'm not exactly sure
[04:22:55.020 --> 04:22:57.500]  You know how your political climate is there in Canada?
[04:22:57.500 --> 04:23:02.740]  But I definitely agree with that statement and I would say that we need to not be so exclusively focused on the top
[04:23:02.740 --> 04:23:07.160]  We need to also get active at the local level. That's one of the things that
[04:23:07.620 --> 04:23:12.780]  people who are socialists have been very effective at doing is they've been much more effective at
[04:23:12.900 --> 04:23:16.740]  organizing at the local level and we don't want to make the same mistake that the
[04:23:17.180 --> 04:23:19.180]  socialists the communitarians make
[04:23:19.860 --> 04:23:21.860]  of trying to
[04:23:22.300 --> 04:23:24.460]  You know try to fix everything at the top level
[04:23:25.140 --> 04:23:26.940]  You know what, but they do
[04:23:26.940 --> 04:23:32.580]  Activate at the lower level they think nationally or globally and then they activate at the local level, right?
[04:23:32.580 --> 04:23:38.620]  We need to be focused on individuals and we need to start a lot of the resistance that we're seeing is coming from the state
[04:23:38.620 --> 04:23:39.540]  level
[04:23:39.540 --> 04:23:41.540]  And so we need to support people
[04:23:41.620 --> 04:23:48.020]  Like those people here in Texas who are fighting back against the NDAA who are fighting back against the TSA trying to put restrictions on
[04:23:48.020 --> 04:23:53.180]  Those so people need to look and see what's going on in their area and even try to support those areas
[04:23:53.220 --> 04:23:56.020]  Outside of their state when there's something happening at a state level
[04:23:56.020 --> 04:23:58.620]  We really do need to try to get back to a division of power
[04:23:58.620 --> 04:24:03.140]  between the Federals and the state and we need to also keep in mind
[04:24:03.940 --> 04:24:08.060]  juries and we need to understand that that's a very effective thing that we have and
[04:24:08.820 --> 04:24:11.940]  We can always bring that to bear. We need to educate each other about jury nullification
[04:24:12.460 --> 04:24:15.900]  All right. Thank you for your call V. We'll move on to Donald in Texas
[04:24:17.140 --> 04:24:19.980]  Yes, sir. I just have one question about Boston
[04:24:20.740 --> 04:24:25.180]  If we had all these policemen there hundreds of them and soldiers there
[04:24:25.180 --> 04:24:30.240]  How many of them were hit by shrapnel when these things went off? I do not know
[04:24:30.960 --> 04:24:32.520]  They wanted to get out of the way
[04:24:32.520 --> 04:24:39.240]  I don't know cuz we've heard the reports over well Rob do it's given the story about his brother-in-law was in the army
[04:24:39.240 --> 04:24:40.480]  I believe he's a
[04:24:40.480 --> 04:24:45.400]  Jogger in the army and he was pulled out of the race his brother-in-law before the bombs went off
[04:24:45.400 --> 04:24:50.880]  So as far as I know I'm not saying there haven't been but I've not heard any stories of police or military
[04:24:51.080 --> 04:24:52.800]  Being hit by the shrapnel. Have you David?
[04:24:52.800 --> 04:24:56.040]  Well, it's hard to say because they really haven't talked very much about any of the victims
[04:24:56.040 --> 04:24:58.520]  I took him a very long time before they talked about who was hit
[04:24:58.520 --> 04:25:03.300]  they had an eight-year-old that they released that right away and then they waited a while and they said there was a
[04:25:04.200 --> 04:25:09.520]  Lady who was killed and then there was last I heard the third person who was killed was an Asian
[04:25:10.240 --> 04:25:15.000]  I don't know. Yeah, but I haven't heard it. There was a lot of people that were injured
[04:25:15.000 --> 04:25:19.160]  I don't know but that's a very good point caller that you made. I will have to wait and see what happens with that
[04:25:19.160 --> 04:25:25.180]  You think it's worth looking into I think it's definitely worth looking into but it's like David
[04:25:25.180 --> 04:25:28.640]  David said they haven't been talking about the the people who've been injured
[04:25:28.640 --> 04:25:32.160]  They talked about the people who lost their lives, but not the people who've been injured
[04:25:32.360 --> 04:25:35.840]  Maybe they were told to move on down the street and get the hell out of the way heck
[04:25:35.840 --> 04:25:40.640]  I don't worry. Well, that's a good that'd be a good thing for anybody in the in the city of Boston to look into just
[04:25:41.440 --> 04:25:46.240]  We have to also remember that even in false flags. Not everybody is clued in on it
[04:25:46.240 --> 04:25:52.440]  Mm-hmm, so there could very well be it would not mean that this was not a false flag if there were officers or security
[04:25:52.560 --> 04:25:59.480]  personnel that were injured because you really only have to have a couple of people who are basically inside on this thing and have the
[04:25:59.720 --> 04:26:05.520]  Uniforms for something to work, you know, it's that kind of compartmentalization. So right. All right. Thank you for your call
[04:26:05.520 --> 04:26:09.940]  And that's a good point anybody in the city of Boston talk to your local police were they injured were they not injured
[04:26:10.300 --> 04:26:12.300]  Joseph in North Carolina
[04:26:12.960 --> 04:26:15.020]  Hey, how are you? Very well, sir
[04:26:15.020 --> 04:26:22.260]  I like to say before I start that you guys are really great and I really enjoy watching
[04:26:22.260 --> 04:26:28.500]  I've grown to appreciate you. I like Alex Alex is sort of rush limbaugh with temper
[04:26:28.660 --> 04:26:32.840]  But you guys are good also and the more I watch you the better. I think you are
[04:26:33.460 --> 04:26:39.540]  So I just with that little fan letter. I'll tell you that the only thing I wanted to say is that
[04:26:40.700 --> 04:26:42.800]  what Obama or what the
[04:26:42.800 --> 04:26:49.400]  Globalist or whatever you want to call them. We're trying to do here was kind of a triple bank shot
[04:26:50.120 --> 04:26:53.520]  They were trying to stage a terrorist incident
[04:26:54.040 --> 04:27:00.160]  That basically as you said would get TSA on the street and out of the airport
[04:27:00.640 --> 04:27:05.620]  Make everybody afraid there's going to be another one and then they were hoping to
[04:27:06.760 --> 04:27:08.760]  basically arrest a patsy
[04:27:08.760 --> 04:27:15.680]  who they then could blame the whole thing on reloaders people who have gunpowder and
[04:27:16.400 --> 04:27:22.160]  and they were hoping that maybe they even could could you know win the jackpot and
[04:27:22.880 --> 04:27:27.640]  Arrest somebody who was an NRA member or at least a gun owner
[04:27:27.920 --> 04:27:34.320]  So that actually this incident was timed and was intended to occur in
[04:27:34.320 --> 04:27:40.480]  In conjunction with the consideration of the gun bill in Washington this week exactly
[04:27:40.480 --> 04:27:45.040]  I agree that 100% because when I've been going to the the gun stores like we did that bullet report
[04:27:45.040 --> 04:27:46.800]  For Alex a couple weeks ago
[04:27:46.800 --> 04:27:51.660]  I was thinking to myself the next thing they're going trying to outlaw to try to outlaw is making your own
[04:27:51.840 --> 04:27:54.200]  ammunition and the supplies that are used therein
[04:27:54.880 --> 04:27:56.880]  Absolutely, they were coming after
[04:27:57.080 --> 04:27:59.440]  Registration though, and I think that's been it
[04:27:59.440 --> 04:28:03.840]  I mean certainly this fast and furious was all about moving weapons across borders
[04:28:03.840 --> 04:28:09.480]  And to try to stop weapons moving across borders the solution of that of course was the UN arms trade treaty
[04:28:09.760 --> 04:28:13.600]  those things have been in the works for a very long time for many years and
[04:28:14.000 --> 04:28:15.880]  I think all of this was pulled together
[04:28:15.880 --> 04:28:21.480]  We're coming at registration particularly on multiple fronts, and we certainly beat him back on that one yesterday
[04:28:21.840 --> 04:28:27.860]  All right, and thank you for your call Joseph the number to call in is eight seven seven seven eight nine Alex
[04:28:27.860 --> 04:28:32.080]  That is eight seven seven seven eight nine two five three nine
[04:28:32.080 --> 04:28:37.940]  And you can watch on infowars.com forward slash listen or on prison planet TV
[04:28:37.940 --> 04:28:40.200]  We'll move on now to Chris in Michigan
[04:28:42.400 --> 04:28:43.640]  Hello
[04:28:43.640 --> 04:28:47.880]  How's it going um yeah today? There was actually a bomb scare in Detroit
[04:28:48.440 --> 04:28:49.920]  Wow
[04:28:49.920 --> 04:28:52.140]  Where are you guys heard about that? Oh? No?
[04:28:52.680 --> 04:28:55.560]  Yeah, they evacuated the street my girlfriend actually lives down there
[04:28:56.200 --> 04:29:01.280]  She had a bunch of pictures they closed down the streets and I'm yesterday the Detroit free press online
[04:29:01.280 --> 04:29:08.080]  Posted an illustrated picture on how to build a pipe bomb or not a pipe bomb the pressure cooker
[04:29:08.080 --> 04:29:13.080]  But now before we get to that before we get to the pressure cookie you said that the bomb scare was today or yesterday
[04:29:13.960 --> 04:29:17.500]  This the bomb scare was today. This is still ongoing
[04:29:18.120 --> 04:29:21.040]  Yes, see what is the bomb scare still ongoing?
[04:29:22.160 --> 04:29:24.220]  No it um they defused
[04:29:25.040 --> 04:29:27.040]  They defused it and um
[04:29:27.040 --> 04:29:33.120]  But there was a there's another bomb square. I posted on Facebook someone else saying there was a bomb square in, Washington
[04:29:33.120 --> 04:29:37.200]  And then the one caller said there was one in LA and it just seems like yeah
[04:29:37.200 --> 04:29:40.760]  That's a lot a lot going on there's gonna be a lot of copycat stuff like that
[04:29:40.760 --> 04:29:44.460]  There always is I remember back when I was in high school, and I was a long time ago
[04:29:44.600 --> 04:29:46.680]  We used to have bomb scares regularly of course
[04:29:46.680 --> 04:29:51.300]  I think it was kids calling up to try to get out of exams, but now especially when it's an actual bomb
[04:29:51.800 --> 04:29:53.240]  They did find a bomb
[04:29:53.240 --> 04:29:59.160]  All right, so I mean it's the but if people are thinking the Boston one's an inside job or whatever a false flag
[04:29:59.160 --> 04:30:05.800]  Who's to say that they're not trying to you know be the copycats and just completely scare all of us
[04:30:05.800 --> 04:30:09.480]  You know and to believe in that any anything you go to yeah
[04:30:09.480 --> 04:30:13.600]  We'll look into those other scares, but you're talking about they had a article on how to build a bomb
[04:30:14.240 --> 04:30:18.660]  Yeah, and how to build the pressure cooker bomb they had there was a pretty illustrated graphic
[04:30:18.660 --> 04:30:23.540]  I'm how to make one and then lo and behold the next day. You know they apologized for it
[04:30:23.540 --> 04:30:29.020]  But if people die because now they everyone knows how to go on you know they can't apologize for people dying
[04:30:29.060 --> 04:30:34.780]  You know that you can't just say sorry, and it's all good. Why would you publish something like that?
[04:30:34.780 --> 04:30:40.740]  I just don't understand that you know there's an interesting article on info wars today, and it was by John Rappaport
[04:30:40.740 --> 04:30:42.740]  And he's talking about
[04:30:42.940 --> 04:30:45.680]  Actually he linked to a YouTube video a guy did an analysis
[04:30:45.680 --> 04:30:51.180]  And he said if they were building this pressure cooker bomb the way they were showing it on CNN with nails inside
[04:30:51.180 --> 04:30:55.780]  That's where they you would expect it to be concentric, and you would expect it to be riddled with holes
[04:30:56.500 --> 04:30:59.220]  the exploded pressure cooker that they found
[04:31:00.020 --> 04:31:05.620]  Was not it was basically just blown out in one direction the only hole in it was a machined hole
[04:31:05.620 --> 04:31:09.220]  And he was saying it looked to him like it was a shaped charge
[04:31:09.220 --> 04:31:14.180]  Which would indicate that it wasn't necessarily an amateur that was doing something like this, but somebody who was more sophisticated
[04:31:14.180 --> 04:31:17.020]  so there's a lot of back and forth that's going to be going on about this and
[04:31:18.100 --> 04:31:20.100]  Certainly, we believe that
[04:31:20.420 --> 04:31:26.820]  like I said it certainly was a motivation for the government to be a part of a false flag operation because
[04:31:26.860 --> 04:31:32.140]  We know how they use these things the thing that really kicked it though for us was not just that they had
[04:31:32.580 --> 04:31:38.300]  Motive and something to gain from it, but that they also had a bomb drill that was going on simultaneously
[04:31:38.300 --> 04:31:42.380]  I think that's the key thing in it these other things may or may not be but
[04:31:42.380 --> 04:31:50.180]  We certainly expect the government to do more and bigger things because when they cannot shape the narrative with one event
[04:31:50.180 --> 04:31:53.340]  They will stage another one. Yeah, and we've seen that in the past
[04:31:54.060 --> 04:31:59.500]  Exactly, and they're confident. They're confident that they don't get their way if Napolitano has her budget slashed
[04:31:59.500 --> 04:32:01.420]  If Feinstein can't get the guns off the streets
[04:32:01.420 --> 04:32:06.740]  There'll be more and let me say this and that's another reason why it's important for people to understand
[04:32:06.740 --> 04:32:10.380]  What a false flag is so many people have do not understand
[04:32:10.380 --> 04:32:15.460]  the MO of the government and how they shape the narrative how they manipulate the public a
[04:32:15.460 --> 04:32:20.740]  False flag has a very long history to it, and it's been used recently in a lot of different things
[04:32:20.740 --> 04:32:24.820]  But we've documented that in our very first magazine going back for decades
[04:32:26.340 --> 04:32:28.520]  Documents that have now been declassified and
[04:32:29.260 --> 04:32:30.600]  There are other
[04:32:30.600 --> 04:32:36.700]  Aspects that are more recent going back to September 11th and other attacks like that in the last 10 years has been so many times
[04:32:36.700 --> 04:32:44.260]  They've used that where they have a drill at exactly the same time exactly the same place exactly the same threat level happens
[04:32:44.620 --> 04:32:50.380]  Simultaneously that just is incredible and people need to understand what their mo is and if we can understand that
[04:32:50.660 --> 04:32:56.780]  We can shut down some of these horrific events that they're going to pull off if people are ignorant about it
[04:32:56.780 --> 04:32:58.700]  So that's why it's so important to get that term out
[04:32:58.700 --> 04:33:03.740]  There is why it's so great that that's trending high now after Dan Badandi at the press conference
[04:33:03.740 --> 04:33:08.060]  He really pushed that is great job Dan great job, Dan. Thank you for your call Chris save lives
[04:33:08.060 --> 04:33:10.820]  We'll move on to CJ in Michigan, Michigan
[04:33:12.860 --> 04:33:14.860]  Whoa, hello
[04:33:15.220 --> 04:33:17.220]  Yeah, hey listen
[04:33:18.100 --> 04:33:22.180]  This wiggle thing this turns out to be some kind of event
[04:33:22.820 --> 04:33:25.540]  what I'm predicting everyone likes predictions is
[04:33:26.740 --> 04:33:33.700]  If it is that would tell you that they're planning a bunch of events because they would never do something so close to another event
[04:33:33.700 --> 04:33:38.300]  Because then that would take out the the mileage that they're gonna get from the Boston Marathon
[04:33:38.420 --> 04:33:42.620]  I predicted this a couple years ago that that you always heard about
[04:33:43.500 --> 04:33:45.500]  Iran's gonna have these
[04:33:45.700 --> 04:33:52.140]  Sleeper cells and they're gonna be activated. So, you know if they want to have martial law, you know
[04:33:52.140 --> 04:33:56.380]  It's a big event like the World Trade Center, you know who I'm scared, but it's New York
[04:33:56.380 --> 04:34:02.660]  I don't live in New York, but once they start hitting the soft targets here. They're small-town America
[04:34:02.660 --> 04:34:09.060]  Then mr. Mr. America, we have to implement martial law because no one's safe anywhere
[04:34:09.420 --> 04:34:15.180]  That's right. That's pretty much what we're seeing already. We see on the the pictures in Boston other guys checking papers and
[04:34:15.940 --> 04:34:20.580]  People just willingly accept that because of the situation and I mean, it's not just there
[04:34:20.580 --> 04:34:25.820]  Like we said, it's been many other places. We saw them at a checkpoint at LAX or outside LAX
[04:34:25.820 --> 04:34:30.500]  They were checking people and if these things happen more frequent, especially if they hit hometown America
[04:34:30.500 --> 04:34:36.820]  Like you said people just gonna roll over. Oh, absolutely. Yeah, it's their agenda is advanced by fear and
[04:34:37.380 --> 04:34:41.780]  Paranoia, that's what they accuse us of but we've as you documented in that report
[04:34:41.780 --> 04:34:45.060]  That was really good that you put in there. How many times have we seen?
[04:34:45.540 --> 04:34:50.500]  Biden and Obama go back on their word, you know, Obama wasn't gonna sign the NDAA and then he did
[04:34:50.820 --> 04:34:52.740]  They weren't gonna ban guns and then they did
[04:34:52.740 --> 04:34:56.940]  I mean just over and over and over again even in the debate where he's accusing the other guy
[04:34:56.940 --> 04:35:00.740]  Right, they're pointing at each other. Yeah, and actually the other guy did sign
[04:35:00.740 --> 04:35:05.780]  it was a valid criticism, but he was saying that he wasn't a part of it and when actuality he was and and
[04:35:06.140 --> 04:35:08.080]  People just have to go back and look at the records
[04:35:08.080 --> 04:35:14.540]  but they think we're so stupid that we won't go back and look at their lies on YouTube that we won't go back and look
[04:35:14.540 --> 04:35:16.280]  at their voting record and
[04:35:16.280 --> 04:35:18.340]  You know you showed it and that's the thing
[04:35:18.340 --> 04:35:23.520]  We have to we have to pull those things up and we have to show each other what they're doing and just expose their lies
[04:35:23.520 --> 04:35:26.900]  All right. Thank you for your call. We'll move on to Bruce in Canada
[04:35:29.240 --> 04:35:34.560]  Very well, very well. Hey great. Um, I called a couple days ago. I didn't mean to sound sarcastic
[04:35:34.720 --> 04:35:40.640]  I think you guys are doing an awesome job. I really I mean that sincerely. I'm sorry
[04:35:40.640 --> 04:35:43.520]  I didn't mean I'm sarcastic last time. Oh, no, that's fine
[04:35:43.520 --> 04:35:49.720]  I hear you guys hitting the acceleration pedal and I mean I want to just give you a couple catalyst
[04:35:49.720 --> 04:35:56.880]  Which you know what catalysts are they're just a speed-up a reaction of the awakening here. And I mean you got this whole
[04:36:00.760 --> 04:36:02.760]  Yes
[04:36:08.120 --> 04:36:12.120]  Sorry Bruce you're you're cutting in cutting out a little bit
[04:36:12.120 --> 04:36:20.240]  Oh, sorry, let me switch phones, I guess. Okay. Well, hold on one second. Hopefully he can get his connection established music
[04:36:21.440 --> 04:36:23.440]  Yeah, that sounds better
[04:36:27.280 --> 04:36:34.440]  Thousands of people that would just sell those things to like dentist office and mechanics office and everything like that in their community
[04:36:34.600 --> 04:36:39.920]  Just you know, just make it simple for right and here's what I do when I have a couple extra
[04:36:39.920 --> 04:36:41.920]  of Obama deception
[04:36:44.800 --> 04:36:46.880]  Like the info words magazine thing
[04:36:47.920 --> 04:36:52.560]  I'm sorry, Bruce. We do appreciate your call. You're just we just have a bad phone line the audio on
[04:36:52.560 --> 04:36:57.160]  I'm sorry, maybe a call back again and maybe try a different phone. Thank you for your call though
[04:36:57.160 --> 04:36:59.160]  We'll move on to K in New Jersey
[04:37:01.240 --> 04:37:05.160]  Page car and David are called in yesterday. Just wanted to
[04:37:05.160 --> 04:37:10.080]  Reiterate how disgusted I am with the incompetence
[04:37:10.080 --> 04:37:17.040]  We can clearly see how Jenna depolitano is having some trouble keeping up with the initial story during that conference
[04:37:17.480 --> 04:37:21.440]  And I can't get that cute back up. We're gonna roll on this second. Go ahead K
[04:37:22.320 --> 04:37:25.280]  Yeah, she she actually had the nerve to say that it's
[04:37:26.680 --> 04:37:28.560]  unreasonable for them
[04:37:28.560 --> 04:37:33.200]  To not do what they did which was deport that one suspect one
[04:37:33.200 --> 04:37:36.680]  Let's just say this was a regular domestic issue
[04:37:37.280 --> 04:37:44.040]  The police would question and have everybody at the scene in for questioning
[04:37:44.120 --> 04:37:48.520]  Nobody would be set free until the investigation was concluded
[04:37:48.520 --> 04:37:54.460]  So to see her with a more large-scale instance say that it's perfectly reasonable to let somebody
[04:37:54.860 --> 04:37:58.880]  Go like that is just beyond me and well, that's nothing new
[04:37:58.880 --> 04:38:04.880]  I mean, we've seen them destroy evidence and cover up a crime scene before at Oklahoma City at September, you know, the the World Trade Center
[04:38:05.920 --> 04:38:12.440]  They don't really follow on these big events like this that have all the hallmarks of a false flag that we believe are false flags
[04:38:12.600 --> 04:38:15.380]  They don't follow the typical rules of investigation
[04:38:16.040 --> 04:38:21.160]  Exactly, just like the Oklahoma City building to cover that up. They just tore the building down. Yeah. Oh, yeah
[04:38:21.160 --> 04:38:23.860]  Yeah, remove the evidence at 9-eleven as well
[04:38:24.640 --> 04:38:26.640]  Did you have another point K?
[04:38:26.640 --> 04:38:30.760]  This is of the World Trade Center started to get shipped to foreign landfills
[04:38:30.760 --> 04:38:37.040]  But I just what I really trying to say is the fact that she thinks that we don't understand or Congress
[04:38:37.040 --> 04:38:43.520]  It doesn't understand the procedures of these types of things that she can just say anything to us the same way Alex keep saying
[04:38:43.520 --> 04:38:46.160]  That they had all the seals out there in uniform
[04:38:46.160 --> 04:38:51.600]  Like we can't see that like they've done this so many times before but we're not getting any dumber
[04:38:51.600 --> 04:38:57.200]  We're just figuring it out. So this is they can't afford to just lie to us like this anymore
[04:38:57.200 --> 04:38:58.360]  That's what I'm trying to say
[04:38:58.360 --> 04:39:03.080]  We got that clip queued up and we're taking like it but you you all need to go to YouTube so that you can
[04:39:03.480 --> 04:39:10.020]  Actually see that because it's just the arrogance of her is the way she looks at this call. I'll tell you I'll tell you
[04:39:10.920 --> 04:39:17.600]  We'll get around to informing you sir. Yeah when we come up with a story that we think that you can comprehend
[04:39:17.600 --> 04:39:20.960]  It's like how dare you? Yeah there you question me, you know
[04:39:20.960 --> 04:39:27.280]  It was just amazing the arrogance but also the you can see the anger and the frustration. Mm-hmm. And he's rolling her eyes
[04:39:27.280 --> 04:39:29.920]  I thought her hair was about to spin around backwards. You gotta love that
[04:39:29.920 --> 04:39:34.320]  It's kind of like that press conference that Obama and Biden had yesterday after they lost that gun control bill
[04:39:34.320 --> 04:39:39.720]  You know the Germans called that schadenfreude, you know, it was so funny to see guys. Let me know when we have that clip
[04:39:39.720 --> 04:39:44.440]  It's so funny to see Biden's face. It looked like his hamster just died or something and he's
[04:39:44.440 --> 04:39:46.040]  I
[04:39:46.040 --> 04:39:48.040]  Try to do this with children
[04:39:48.760 --> 04:39:50.280]  Yeah
[04:39:50.280 --> 04:39:53.760]  Okay, thank you for your call. Okay, we're gonna go down to that clip of Napolitano
[04:39:54.400 --> 04:40:01.060]  I'm very concerned about this person of interest that was detained at the hospital in Boston following the marathon madness
[04:40:01.060 --> 04:40:03.340]  He is I believe scheduled to be deported next week
[04:40:03.340 --> 04:40:07.760]  And now I understand he's been cleared of any wrongdoing in the involvement in Boston
[04:40:07.760 --> 04:40:13.920]  But he is being deported due to national security concerns and but CBS says this this gentleman is here on a student
[04:40:13.920 --> 04:40:17.320]  he said he was at the scene along with many other people when the blast happened as
[04:40:17.600 --> 04:40:23.700]  Everybody's standing in shock three Boston PD detectives. See this guy moving quickly out of the crowd as they're watching him
[04:40:23.700 --> 04:40:25.700]  He seems to be moving very deliberately
[04:40:26.160 --> 04:40:31.460]  Which could be a very natural thing after a bombing they stop him because he's covered with blood they end up taking the hospital
[04:40:31.460 --> 04:40:33.320]  That's straight off CBS
[04:40:33.320 --> 04:40:41.000]  And we're asking average Americans to help ID and assist law enforcement and identifying who the bomber was
[04:40:41.000 --> 04:40:47.080]  See something say something and now we have someone who is being deported due to national security concerns
[04:40:47.080 --> 04:40:50.600]  And I'm assuming that he's got some sort of link to terror or wouldn't be being deported
[04:40:50.600 --> 04:40:51.800]  He was at the scene
[04:40:51.800 --> 04:40:57.880]  He could possibly ID the bomber just like we're asking every other American that was on the scene to provide your pictures
[04:40:57.920 --> 04:41:00.480]  Help us identify who may have been acting funny
[04:41:00.920 --> 04:41:06.440]  Everybody we're asking that that was in Boston and we've got this guy who was there. We know he was there
[04:41:06.440 --> 04:41:09.760]  He was arrested or what arrested was detained in the hospital covered with blood
[04:41:09.760 --> 04:41:14.220]  He was at the scene and yet we're going to deport him. So we're gonna look if I might
[04:41:14.740 --> 04:41:21.480]  Remove him from the scene. I am unaware of anyone who is being deported for national security
[04:41:22.000 --> 04:41:27.960]  Concerns at all related to Boston. I don't know where nothing is related to Boston, but he is being deported
[04:41:29.040 --> 04:41:32.280]  Like I said again, he was I don't even think
[04:41:32.280 --> 04:41:40.040]  He was technically a person of interest or a suspect. That was a wash and I'm unaware of any
[04:41:40.520 --> 04:41:42.920]  Proceeding there. I will clarify that for you
[04:41:42.920 --> 04:41:49.480]  But I think this is an example of why it is so important to let law enforcement do its job
[04:41:49.480 --> 04:41:54.800]  I want them to do their job and that's why I say wouldn't you agree with me that it's negligent for us as American
[04:41:55.080 --> 04:41:59.320]  Administration to deport someone who was reportedly at the scene of the bombing
[04:41:59.320 --> 04:42:03.800]  And we're going to deport him not to be able to question him anymore. Is that not negligence?
[04:42:04.120 --> 04:42:08.320]  I'm not going to answer that question is so full with misstatements and miss
[04:42:09.000 --> 04:42:11.040]  Apprehensions that it's just not worthy of an answer
[04:42:12.360 --> 04:42:17.200]  Well CBS reports the gentleman was there. We did detain him at the hospital. He was covered with blood
[04:42:17.200 --> 04:42:23.640]  We've cleared him of any wrongdoing, but it has been reported. He has been deported on there's been so much reported on this
[04:42:23.640 --> 04:42:27.100]  That's been wrong. I can't even begin to tell you congressman
[04:42:27.100 --> 04:42:32.880]  We will provide you with accurate information as it becomes available. I look forward to that. Thank you. I yield back
[04:42:34.420 --> 04:42:41.340]  And there it is he saw miss Napolitano right there. We will provide you sir. Don't get your sources anywhere else
[04:42:41.340 --> 04:42:47.880]  We will provide you with said information. The press conference is coming up in 20 minutes. That's all I can say
[04:42:48.780 --> 04:42:54.660]  Alex seems very excited about this press conference and we will be giving you live coverage on that
[04:42:54.660 --> 04:42:58.340]  We'll move now to is that Cheryl in North North Carolina?
[04:43:00.300 --> 04:43:02.300]  Hi guys, hi
[04:43:03.060 --> 04:43:05.060]  How are you?
[04:43:05.740 --> 04:43:07.580]  I have to tell you I'm
[04:43:07.580 --> 04:43:10.220]  I'm a newcomer to you guys
[04:43:10.220 --> 04:43:15.140]  I'm a newcomer to this new way of thinking I'm a newcomer in a lot of ways in the last two or three months
[04:43:15.740 --> 04:43:17.060]  and
[04:43:17.060 --> 04:43:24.580]  By nature, I'm a researcher. So when I see something I need multiple sources to tell me. Yeah, this looks pretty legit one
[04:43:24.580 --> 04:43:29.780]  Of the things that caught my attention this morning thought on Facebook of all places was a picture
[04:43:31.540 --> 04:43:34.020]  The principal from new camp
[04:43:34.940 --> 04:43:37.660]  Who and I'm sure you guys have had to the thing this thing
[04:43:37.660 --> 04:43:42.820]  It's it's a flash picture of her with newtown and in the Fox I think is the supposed
[04:43:42.820 --> 04:43:50.980]  That she was one block away from the bombing yesterday would obviously that could not have happened if she is not with us any longer
[04:43:51.660 --> 04:43:53.980]  But the conclusion I found is the pictures
[04:43:54.900 --> 04:43:56.820]  junk, it's
[04:43:56.820 --> 04:43:59.340]  Something somebody has put together for whatever purpose
[04:44:00.140 --> 04:44:03.300]  My reason for bringing this to you and to your attention is
[04:44:04.260 --> 04:44:08.220]  Whoever made this picture. I feel like they're on the good side, you know, they're one of the good guys
[04:44:08.220 --> 04:44:15.260]  But they're too extreme and when things like this come to light and then you show hey, this is inaccurate information
[04:44:15.260 --> 04:44:20.380]  This is not right. Nobody has there. I couldn't find any newsfeed on it whatsoever and
[04:44:21.980 --> 04:44:23.980]  It just makes us look like
[04:44:24.260 --> 04:44:28.020]  Well, you gotta keep in mind that you know, some people do fabricate
[04:44:28.020 --> 04:44:32.660]  I haven't seen that particular image that you refer that you're referring to. I have heard about it
[04:44:32.660 --> 04:44:34.420]  I have not seen it myself
[04:44:34.420 --> 04:44:41.260]  But people do these kind of disinformation things that whether this was somebody who was had the right intentions or you know
[04:44:41.440 --> 04:44:48.740]  You know media hoax or whatever. That's deliberate. Sometimes that's deliberate by government operatives, but sometimes people just aggressive
[04:44:48.900 --> 04:44:52.840]  Yes, and we got some some secret Alex Jones information
[04:44:52.840 --> 04:44:55.740]  I'll just talk about like we referenced a couple days ago
[04:44:56.180 --> 04:44:58.140]  people said that there was a
[04:44:58.140 --> 04:45:04.180]  fabricated news clip or a blood and gore disappeared and we were able to look at the footage and say see that was just a
[04:45:04.180 --> 04:45:07.980]  Bloody rag that was picked up off the ground. It wasn't a computer glitch or anything like that
[04:45:08.100 --> 04:45:13.600]  But yes, that is a very very real concern and there is a lot of disinformation out there
[04:45:13.600 --> 04:45:16.540]  So you like you said you have to get your information from multiple sources
[04:45:16.540 --> 04:45:21.300]  Well, one of the things that we saw which again, you know this this explosion that happened up in Waco
[04:45:22.060 --> 04:45:25.460]  there was report that there was a drill going on at the same time and
[04:45:25.460 --> 04:45:29.560]  When we looked into it, it appeared that the drill was not scheduled for yesterday
[04:45:29.560 --> 04:45:36.380]  but for today and so that doesn't necessarily mean anything and the government is not claiming that that was some kind of a terrorist event so
[04:45:36.380 --> 04:45:44.500]  That you know that doesn't necessarily fit into their narrative. Although it's right there where tomorrow they 20 is the 20th anniversary of when they
[04:45:44.780 --> 04:45:49.500]  Burned all those people at the it's a nice way to keep people away from the the Waco compound
[04:45:49.500 --> 04:45:54.140]  Yeah, so I guess it won't be any commemoration of that. But yeah, definitely appreciate your call
[04:45:54.140 --> 04:45:56.140]  We'll move on to Mike in Louisiana
[04:45:59.580 --> 04:46:01.580]  Yes, go ahead Mike
[04:46:01.580 --> 04:46:06.100]  I know first of all, I want to say that the politics will say yes or no
[04:46:06.100 --> 04:46:08.100]  There was a very simple question to answer
[04:46:08.780 --> 04:46:10.980]  second of all ever since the
[04:46:11.740 --> 04:46:19.000]  Misapp at the Superdome. I'm actually from southeast Louisiana. I decided to take on total how many black helicopters I've seen barely
[04:46:19.660 --> 04:46:25.900]  Yesterday a total of eight. Yes yesterday was a total of 18, which is the largest number I've seen to date
[04:46:26.300 --> 04:46:29.500]  Is there any type of military base or anything where you are?
[04:46:29.500 --> 04:46:34.140]  We do have on we do have a joint naval air station
[04:46:34.260 --> 04:46:37.700]  But I mean this is I mean ridiculously close to my house
[04:46:37.700 --> 04:46:43.820]  I mean it was I probably could have thrown basketball at these guys, you know, I mean, this is this was incredible
[04:46:44.300 --> 04:46:46.300]  Do you have any footage of this?
[04:46:46.580 --> 04:46:48.940]  No, but I'm playing on taking some
[04:46:49.820 --> 04:46:54.740]  Take some and put it on YouTube. Is there an announcement that they would shoot me down if I did
[04:46:54.740 --> 04:47:00.660]  Is there an announced drill in that area? I know there's a lot of military activity
[04:47:02.020 --> 04:47:06.660]  Section but there was nothing that was ever announced. No, there's nothing on you. They tell you, you know, don't be along
[04:47:06.660 --> 04:47:12.760]  This is the news cast, you know, don't worry about the helicopters flying about those. There was no indication this time
[04:47:12.760 --> 04:47:17.140]  I also wanted to make one request of Alex for the old-time listener. Okay?
[04:47:17.980 --> 04:47:20.820]  Did you please do a Cooper commando impression for me?
[04:47:20.820 --> 04:47:25.100]  Oh, yeah, you started out there too. All right. Thanks you. Thanks for your call Mike
[04:47:26.700 --> 04:47:32.020]  Cobra can see I cover commander will protect you from the bombings
[04:47:33.180 --> 04:47:37.440]  I'm not behind it who would say we would do that to take care of freedom
[04:47:38.140 --> 04:47:39.780]  Calvary
[04:47:39.780 --> 04:47:43.580]  Thank you, Alex. All right, and we'll move on to Matt in Oregon
[04:47:43.580 --> 04:47:49.780]  Good afternoon gentlemen, good afternoon. How you doing today? Very well
[04:47:58.500 --> 04:48:05.140]  Austin reminds me of the movie The Thomas Crown up there. I've never seen all the guys into the museum with bowler hats on
[04:48:05.860 --> 04:48:12.060]  And they can't figure out who's who and what's going on to throw off any sort of you know, well-meaning
[04:48:12.060 --> 04:48:15.660]  Individuals. Yeah, exactly the same type scenario
[04:48:16.300 --> 04:48:22.280]  But switching gears the question I had is that someone had brought up on Monday that the New York Times below the fold
[04:48:22.540 --> 04:48:28.220]  Had talked about an indictment of Obama Bush and Clinton of war crimes. Yes
[04:48:29.180 --> 04:48:36.100]  Dr. Pachinik was talking about that yesterday on the Alex Jones radio show and also I referenced it last night of the info wars nightly news
[04:48:36.300 --> 04:48:37.960]  I don't know if we have that article
[04:48:37.960 --> 04:48:44.220]  I believe it was taken down but it was reposted on prison planet so you can go to the archives at prison planet TV or
[04:48:44.500 --> 04:48:51.340]  Also on YouTube and look at some of the there's a bipartisan commission and they produced a 600 page report
[04:48:51.340 --> 04:48:56.660]  They had a one-hour presentation video of their results and what they did was they indicted
[04:48:57.300 --> 04:49:02.300]  The Bush administration the Obama administration even going back to the Bill Clinton administration
[04:49:02.300 --> 04:49:10.260]  talking about essentially war crimes planned at the highest levels of our government and it has some nice quotes in there from guys like
[04:49:10.260 --> 04:49:11.780]  Dick Cheney and
[04:49:11.780 --> 04:49:13.780]  Pelosi saying oh, yeah, we love
[04:49:14.300 --> 04:49:16.300]  Exaggerated or what's the term?
[04:49:16.860 --> 04:49:22.540]  Extraordinary rendition. Yeah, something like that. Yeah, so definitely I check that out that you can find those interviews with dr
[04:49:22.540 --> 04:49:27.140]  Steve Pachinik on the Alex Jones YouTube page. We'll move on now to Marcus in, Texas
[04:49:27.140 --> 04:49:29.140]  Oh
[04:49:30.820 --> 04:49:32.820]  Marcus
[04:49:34.260 --> 04:49:36.260]  Chris okay, go ahead
[04:49:39.060 --> 04:49:43.060]  Tremendously awesome job really appreciate all you guys hard work. Thank you
[04:49:43.780 --> 04:49:48.780]  Kind of off subject, but have you guys heard about this armed peaceful March?
[04:49:49.140 --> 04:49:55.300]  That's supposed to take place in Washington DC on July 4th. No, I have not let fill us in on that
[04:49:55.300 --> 04:49:57.980]  Okay, there's a group called
[04:49:58.980 --> 04:50:02.860]  prepare to take America back on Facebook, okay, and
[04:50:03.500 --> 04:50:10.260]  Apparently they are organizing this arm peaceful March on Washington DC on July 4th, and
[04:50:11.460 --> 04:50:17.940]  They haven't really put out a lot of details. They do have an event scheduled. So that may be something y'all want to take into and
[04:50:18.580 --> 04:50:22.140]  Just your thoughts on whether it'd be a good idea or not
[04:50:22.140 --> 04:50:26.540]  I don't think anytime you have any type of public display of weapons
[04:50:26.540 --> 04:50:32.360]  I definitely recommend having them unloaded regardless of where you are. That'd be my first thought David. Yes, he has some
[04:50:33.140 --> 04:50:39.580]  Probably the most restrictive gun control laws anywhere. So it's gonna be interesting to see what happens with that. Now. There is a
[04:50:40.340 --> 04:50:43.700]  Rally tomorrow. I don't know if you've been following the news here
[04:50:43.700 --> 04:50:50.620]  But Stuart Rhodes of Oath Keepers was scheduled as they have in the past several years to have a rally on
[04:50:50.620 --> 04:50:57.420]  Lexington green to commemorate the anniversary of the British coming in to seize the guns with the Oath Keepers and
[04:50:57.780 --> 04:51:05.500]  It's always been a very peaceful rally of veterans and speeches and that sort of thing and they had their permit cancelled
[04:51:05.500 --> 04:51:10.020]  But I understand they're going to meet there anyway and exercise their First Amendment rights
[04:51:10.020 --> 04:51:13.200]  I believe yeah, they had their permit cancelled because of you know
[04:51:14.140 --> 04:51:18.620]  Danger threats or you know terrorist threats or whatever. They have free speech in a police state
[04:51:18.620 --> 04:51:23.220]  Yeah, you can't have any free speech. Definitely. I will look into that. You said prepare to take America back
[04:51:24.620 --> 04:51:26.620]  Is he going
[04:51:26.700 --> 04:51:32.900]  Yes, okay, we'll look into that. Thank you, sir. The number to call in is eight seven seven seven eight nine Alex
[04:51:32.900 --> 04:51:39.540]  That is eight seven seven seven eight nine two five three nine. We're just about ten minutes away from the press conference
[04:51:39.540 --> 04:51:43.740]  So we'll finish with Tony and then I believe it's is it Danny in Illinois?
[04:51:43.740 --> 04:51:46.820]  And then we'll show a video and come back with the press conference
[04:51:46.820 --> 04:51:49.300]  So Tony go ahead Tony in Pennsylvania
[04:51:51.260 --> 04:51:52.980]  Very well
[04:51:52.980 --> 04:51:54.180]  Good
[04:51:54.180 --> 04:51:58.380]  We need to beat this indictment like a dead horse in all honesty
[04:51:58.380 --> 04:52:02.260]  I think this is gonna be the Hail Mary that brings these ass these guys down
[04:52:03.060 --> 04:52:09.580]  Yeah, go ahead. So we really we really need to to beat this indictment like a dead horse
[04:52:09.580 --> 04:52:13.700]  I can't stress that enough. We need to talk about this more than anything. I would imagine
[04:52:13.700 --> 04:52:16.900]  Mm-hmm. And we got can you guys see if you can find that arc?
[04:52:16.900 --> 04:52:17.740]  I know it was pulled down
[04:52:17.740 --> 04:52:21.540]  But if you can't find it, that would be good go ahead the things that the clinic was talking about it
[04:52:21.540 --> 04:52:24.580]  And and also I would recommend anybody that wants information about this
[04:52:24.980 --> 04:52:30.060]  There is a article at the New York Times called get mo is killing me
[04:52:30.060 --> 04:52:33.300]  And if you want to see what our future is going to be like
[04:52:33.620 --> 04:52:39.500]  Under the kind of NDAA world that Lindsey Graham and John McCain and Carl Levin
[04:52:39.500 --> 04:52:45.940]  Want to institute here in Obama want to institute here. Take a look at that because people who will do that to
[04:52:46.820 --> 04:52:50.460]  Someone who is not an American citizen will do that to an American citizen
[04:52:50.460 --> 04:52:53.240]  And let me let me give the the viewers this article David
[04:52:53.240 --> 04:52:59.040]  This is the New York Times US engaged in torture after 9-11 review concludes again
[04:52:59.040 --> 04:53:04.380]  that is US engaged in torture after 9-11 review concludes, so that's just one of the many articles and
[04:53:04.380 --> 04:53:08.620]  And to get that out to your friends and family pachinik had a article as well
[04:53:08.620 --> 04:53:13.240]  I believe it was taken down to maybe on Planet Info Wars. I believe so, but you're right, sir
[04:53:13.240 --> 04:53:19.980]  This is definitely something that needs to be to publicize you to get your friends in on the on the action
[04:53:19.980 --> 04:53:26.140]  I do have one more question that what is the possibility of this even going through they gonna weasel their way out of this one
[04:53:26.140 --> 04:53:27.100]  You think?
[04:53:27.100 --> 04:53:32.580]  Well, this group doesn't have I don't know this group has any legal clout to do this
[04:53:32.580 --> 04:53:36.560]  Basically, what they did was they conducted a very long investigation of these three
[04:53:37.460 --> 04:53:42.460]  Administrations and they put their data out there, but I don't think that they're anything like a grand jury
[04:53:42.460 --> 04:53:44.620]  They don't have any kind of indictment powers
[04:53:44.620 --> 04:53:48.200]  I mean they've indicted them in a somewhat symbolic like in the in the public
[04:53:48.780 --> 04:53:56.140]  pachinik was sad it was very significant in his mind that this would even go through because to him it appeared that
[04:53:56.980 --> 04:54:01.220]  people were withdrawing important people were withdrawing their support from Obama and
[04:54:01.220 --> 04:54:05.560]  I kind of leaving him hanging out there to dry. So we'll see what happens with that
[04:54:05.780 --> 04:54:11.440]  Yeah, but definitely inform your friends and family of that one, sir and our last call Dan and Illinois
[04:54:14.260 --> 04:54:19.540]  Way short for time maybe I'm smoking something but I don't smoke something but maybe I should be smoking something
[04:54:19.540 --> 04:54:25.980]  We are the public we have public servants. Oh, I'm sorry. I want to be little Hitlers, but you see the way I see this
[04:54:25.980 --> 04:54:27.980]  I don't want everybody's getting so excited
[04:54:27.980 --> 04:54:34.540]  Outside of us our law enforcement our military our militias losing the right to own arms
[04:54:35.180 --> 04:54:37.180]  Because you see they're taking oath to the Constitution
[04:54:37.980 --> 04:54:43.220]  Okay, so the Constitution applies to them if this does not apply to the public. We have a Dick Act
[04:54:43.580 --> 04:54:48.660]  Okay, we have our Bill of Rights and first and foremost we have our god-given rights
[04:54:48.660 --> 04:54:54.000]  We don't need permission if they're going to take away the Second Amendment the whatever they're going to say
[04:54:54.000 --> 04:54:59.720]  These are a set of rules our Constitution is a rule book. Hey Dan. Okay, just hold on one second
[04:54:59.720 --> 04:55:00.920]  I just want to talk to guys for one second
[04:55:00.920 --> 04:55:07.120]  Can we get the clip MSNBC host blames NRA for law enforcement and ability at Boston if we can go out to break on?
[04:55:07.120 --> 04:55:09.120]  That one but go ahead Dan finish your point
[04:55:11.480 --> 04:55:15.640]  Everybody's worried about this Constitution stuff. Yeah, I'm worried about it because you know
[04:55:16.560 --> 04:55:23.120]  People are getting blindsided that the Constitution is rules and regulations for our law enforcement our military
[04:55:23.120 --> 04:55:26.000]  That's right law enforcement and our military need to be on
[04:55:26.760 --> 04:55:33.000]  Okay, and that's who this applies to not the people you can't you can't disarm the public
[04:55:33.000 --> 04:55:40.120]  We are the public they are the servants and if you look at article 1 section 8 the Constitution it clearly identifies the militia as being
[04:55:40.760 --> 04:55:42.720]  the core of our defense
[04:55:42.720 --> 04:55:48.120]  Permanent standing armies were only to be funded or not to be permanent armies were only to be funded for two years at a time
[04:55:48.480 --> 04:55:52.080]  But you know when they talk about 90% of the people supported their legislation
[04:55:52.080 --> 04:55:56.840]  well, I don't know where they got that figure but you know what it doesn't matter if 90% of the people got it because as
[04:55:56.840 --> 04:56:01.620]  Jefferson said a democracy is where 51% of the people take away the rights of the other 49
[04:56:01.620 --> 04:56:06.360]  It's two walls and two walls and a sheep voting for what's that's right. That's right
[04:56:06.360 --> 04:56:12.160]  We have the Constitution we have that rule of law there because and they swear allegiance to it and they are essentially
[04:56:12.520 --> 04:56:17.320]  temporary stewards who are swearing allegiance to the king of the land and that King is a
[04:56:17.320 --> 04:56:24.840]  law what they said at the colonial times Lex Rex that's Latin for the law is king and that's what they're swearing allegiance to and
[04:56:24.840 --> 04:56:32.040]  When they do anything to undermine that they're basically not only committing with their unfaithful stewards, and they're committing treason
[04:56:32.200 --> 04:56:34.240]  All right. Thank you for your call. We have to go to break
[04:56:34.240 --> 04:56:39.700]  We will be back with the other press conference and then more of your calls the number to call in is eight seven seven
[04:56:39.920 --> 04:56:44.260]  Seven eight nine Alex that is eight seven seven seven eight nine two five three nine
[04:56:44.260 --> 04:56:47.040]  But remember we're gonna start with a press conference back on the other side
[04:56:47.040 --> 04:56:49.840]  So guys roll to the video when whenever you're ready
[04:56:50.320 --> 04:56:56.880]  Today the gun lobbyists at the NRA got what they wanted on the floor of the United States Senate and tonight
[04:56:57.200 --> 04:57:05.240]  Lobbyists from the NRA have made it harder for the FBI to find the murderer who planted the bombs here in Boston
[04:57:07.280 --> 04:57:13.400]  The investigation into Monday's bombing in Boston intensifies there's a lot of information flying around right now
[04:57:13.400 --> 04:57:19.960]  we've heard conflicting information various media accounts right now as to whether or not someone is in custody a
[04:57:20.040 --> 04:57:23.840]  Suspect is about to be arrested. I've just been told that an arrest has been made
[04:57:23.840 --> 04:57:28.080]  We are just not comfortable at this hour reporting that several law enforcement
[04:57:28.440 --> 04:57:33.520]  Sources tell us that has not happened all of our sources say no arrest on the record
[04:57:33.520 --> 04:57:36.280]  There's been no arrest in the Boston bombings case
[04:57:36.280 --> 04:57:41.120]  Here is what we actually know investigators have identified solid leads from video evidence
[04:57:41.120 --> 04:57:46.720]  Investigators have obtained video surveillance video specifically from a department store the person
[04:57:47.000 --> 04:57:52.840]  Placing a black bag down near the seam of the blast at the same time as you've heard they're piecing together the bomb parts
[04:57:52.840 --> 04:57:58.920]  It's a very promising lead the tracking where they were purchased. The investigation is accelerating pretty rapidly
[04:57:58.920 --> 04:58:02.880]  What happened to us the other day will not cow it will not change us
[04:58:02.880 --> 04:58:12.200]  What happened the other day was not just an attack against Boston. There's an attack against all of us
[04:58:14.280 --> 04:58:18.200]  There are new developments tonight in the bombing investigation here in Boston
[04:58:18.200 --> 04:58:25.080]  But that investigation could be moving faster were it not for the successful lobbying efforts of the National Rifle
[04:58:25.080 --> 04:58:33.800]  Association the NRA's effort to guarantee that American mass murderers are the best equipped mass murderers in the world is not
[04:58:33.840 --> 04:58:37.640]  limited to murderers use assault weapons and high-capacity
[04:58:38.040 --> 04:58:45.160]  Magazines the NRA is also in the business of helping bombers get away with their crimes
[04:58:45.440 --> 04:58:52.520]  Gunpowder could be traced by investigators to a buyer at the point of sale if gunpowder contained a
[04:58:52.520 --> 04:58:59.200]  Taggant an element that would enable tracing of the purchase of gunpowder, but thanks to the National Rifle Association
[04:59:00.680 --> 04:59:04.840]  Identification taggants are required by law only in
[04:59:05.520 --> 04:59:09.800]  plastic explosives the NRA has successfully blocked any
[04:59:10.440 --> 04:59:12.440]  requirements for such taggants in
[04:59:13.120 --> 04:59:20.720]  Gunpowder so such supremely helpful evidence as taggants are not available to the FBI in this
[04:59:20.720 --> 04:59:26.560]  Investigation the FBI tells NBC News it is following some promising leads
[04:59:26.800 --> 04:59:34.480]  one in particular video and images collected by authorities showing someone carrying a heavy backpack or duffel bag and
[04:59:34.840 --> 04:59:38.880]  Placing it at the spot where the second bomb went off
[04:59:39.440 --> 04:59:45.760]  Key evidence is also being obtained from footage captured by a security camera above
[04:59:45.760 --> 04:59:50.660]  One of the bomb sites that camera was on the top of the Lord and Taylor department store on
[04:59:51.040 --> 04:59:53.120]  Boylston Street just over here one block away
[04:59:53.720 --> 04:59:59.520]  Despite conflicting reports today in the media none of which originated from this network
[05:00:00.000 --> 05:00:07.120]  There has been no arrest of any individual or individuals at this time the FBI and Boston police
[05:00:07.360 --> 05:00:09.360]  Are calling for restraint?
[05:00:09.360 --> 05:00:17.480]  All right and welcome back to the Alex Jones radio show serious overdrive myself and David Knight if you're watching on prison planet
[05:00:17.480 --> 05:00:19.480]  TV or infowars.com

[05:00:26.880 --> 05:00:29.180]  Just let us know when that's up and ready, but in the meantime
[05:00:29.180 --> 05:00:36.280]  We can take a couple more calls the number to call is is eight seven seven seven eight nine Alex that is eight seven seven seven
[05:00:36.280 --> 05:00:40.960]  Eight nine two five three nine and before we go to the calls David. Do you have any thoughts?
[05:00:41.400 --> 05:00:43.760]  Yeah, today is tax freedom day
[05:00:43.760 --> 05:00:49.280]  So just think about that New Year's Eve party that you're at and think about all the days that you've worked
[05:00:49.440 --> 05:00:55.120]  Between then and now that all goes to the government unless you live in, New York, California
[05:00:55.320 --> 05:01:01.240]  New Jersey or Illinois in which case you're still working for the government right okay now. I we do have the press conference
[05:01:01.240 --> 05:01:03.240]  Let's go to that
[05:01:03.240 --> 05:01:09.280]  I'm Prince to begin. They've just given us that man. You just saw there, but they call a five-minute warning
[05:01:13.760 --> 05:01:14.980]  Anything else
[05:01:14.980 --> 05:01:19.880]  Except him as well. Thank you sir all right, so we got about a five-minute head start
[05:01:19.880 --> 05:01:26.300]  So let's go over a couple articles and since we have time in the college and call in at eight seven seven seven eight nine
[05:01:26.820 --> 05:01:30.260]  Alex I like this one from the the National Review online
[05:01:30.260 --> 05:01:37.420]  Feinstein show some guts. This is Feinstein. I believe after the the bill was struck down in the Senate
[05:01:37.560 --> 05:01:42.660]  She says I am really she grinned and concerned if anybody cares
[05:01:43.020 --> 05:01:49.780]  Vote to at least prospectively banned the manufacturer the sale the importation of military-style assault weapons
[05:01:49.780 --> 05:01:52.220]  She said remarks on the Senate floor
[05:01:52.220 --> 05:01:58.540]  That's right have some guts man up and destroy the Constitution pretty pretty much is what she was you afraid of that law
[05:01:58.540 --> 05:02:01.000]  I mean, that's just a piece of paper right yeah
[05:02:01.820 --> 05:02:07.420]  Paper that piece of paper can't hurt you you should do what I tell you to do well speaking of the Constitution guys
[05:02:07.420 --> 05:02:09.420]  we've had a victory with the
[05:02:10.180 --> 05:02:11.540]  trying to
[05:02:11.540 --> 05:02:14.900]  Destroy the Second Amendment and putting registration unconstitutional
[05:02:15.420 --> 05:02:20.060]  Requirements on things and trying to turn what is a fundamental right into a government granted privilege?
[05:02:20.260 --> 05:02:24.340]  But now is not the time to rest on your laurels. We have the CISPA
[05:02:24.340 --> 05:02:28.040]  a bill has already been passed by the
[05:02:28.460 --> 05:02:32.220]  House of Representatives it passed by a large margin
[05:02:33.020 --> 05:02:38.580]  288 to 127 and it is going before the Senate. They're moving pretty quickly on this and
[05:02:39.380 --> 05:02:41.540]  This is something that is in
[05:02:42.180 --> 05:02:48.460]  Direct conflict with a Fourth Amendment to be secure in your privacy and your person in your home and house
[05:02:48.460 --> 05:02:56.020]  If we're going to allow them to destroy our freedoms in the virtual world they will destroy our freedoms in the physical world as well
[05:02:56.020 --> 05:02:59.020]  just like they are doing at the airport and many other ways and
[05:02:59.580 --> 05:03:04.580]  Look at some of the things that were said on this we had a representative Rogers. Who's a Republican
[05:03:05.140 --> 05:03:11.700]  From Michigan, and he called anybody who opposed this a teenage basement tweeter
[05:03:11.700 --> 05:03:15.660]  And he was saying that all the corporations were in support of this
[05:03:15.660 --> 05:03:21.300]  But there's many internet companies, and here's a list of them that we get from the electronic freedom foundation org
[05:03:21.300 --> 05:03:23.060]  That's EFF org
[05:03:23.060 --> 05:03:28.820]  They said Mozilla read it name cheap Gandhi net others have come out strongly against the bill
[05:03:29.260 --> 05:03:36.940]  70 cybersecurity experts and academics sent a joint letter opposing it there are 34 civil liberties groups that have sent a letter opposing
[05:03:37.060 --> 05:03:39.060]  CISPA in its current form and
[05:03:39.260 --> 05:03:44.300]  Listen to this incredible thing that was said by Rogers. He said all we're talking about here is
[05:03:44.300 --> 05:03:51.300]  Zeros and ones hundreds of millions of times a second in patterns it has nothing to do with content nothing
[05:03:51.300 --> 05:03:57.500]  I mean that is so profoundly is that guy think that we are blithering idiots, or is he a blithering idiot
[05:03:57.500 --> 05:03:59.620]  I mean that is the most profoundly ignorant thing
[05:03:59.620 --> 05:04:06.340]  I've ever seen of course all digital communication is a series of ones and zeros and that's how you constitute the content
[05:04:06.340 --> 05:04:08.220]  I mean that is just
[05:04:08.220 --> 05:04:11.420]  mind-boggling that he would make that kind of a statement as well as disparaging
[05:04:11.420 --> 05:04:17.460]  Anybody who disagrees with the idea that the Fourth Amendment is sacrosanct and needs to be respected
[05:04:17.460 --> 05:04:21.700]  Just like the other ones and this is where we need to break this left-right paradigm
[05:04:22.300 --> 05:04:26.100]  For so long the left has cared about civil liberties issues
[05:04:26.340 --> 05:04:33.340]  But disparage the Second Amendment and the right basically would care about the Second Amendment and disparage civil liberties
[05:04:33.340 --> 05:04:36.220]  Or kind of ignore them we need to get the same people who?
[05:04:36.220 --> 05:04:42.900]  Harangued the Senate to do the right thing we need to get them on the senators and say we don't just want the Second Amendment
[05:04:42.900 --> 05:04:48.220]  We want the Fourth Amendment. We want the Sixth Amendment all the First Amendment exactly want all of these things so
[05:04:48.980 --> 05:04:55.020]  Get on you know tell people on Facebook to get on to the senators everybody give them a call and let them know because time
[05:04:55.020 --> 05:05:00.900]  Is very short that's very important. This is a good time, especially the people who are internet savvy, and you know use it
[05:05:01.540 --> 05:05:04.540]  Quite frequently this concerns you a great deal
[05:05:04.540 --> 05:05:10.900]  It's not just about you know hacking the new Iron Man movie or whatever else use those ones and zeros to inform each other
[05:05:10.900 --> 05:05:13.740]  Yeah, use those ones and zeros to inform each other like you
[05:05:14.180 --> 05:05:16.180]  Write your friends all day on Twitter and Facebook
[05:05:16.420 --> 05:05:21.900]  Write your congressman write your senator write write people who can actually do things about this and say hey
[05:05:21.900 --> 05:05:27.100]  I'm a supporter you or at least I could potentially support you if you support getting this out of here
[05:05:27.100 --> 05:05:31.140]  So definitely keep that in mind and talking. I just mentioned briefly the new Iron Man movie I
[05:05:31.140 --> 05:05:36.020]  Saw this on Drudge yesterday. They have smell-o-vision now. Did you see that?
[05:05:38.340 --> 05:05:44.040]  Yeah, it's it's smell-o-vision so you can smell Robert Downey jr.. Sweaty armpits and our man
[05:05:44.040 --> 05:05:47.940]  They call it 4d all right, so you have smell now in your movie great
[05:05:47.940 --> 05:05:51.660]  I think that's gonna be of an even bigger flop of the theaters on 3d is turning out to be
[05:05:51.660 --> 05:05:55.940]  Oh my god to focus on content. Oh, yeah, that's what that's way off topic
[05:05:55.940 --> 05:06:00.960]  Where are we in the the press conference or we're about to start or still still waiting, okay?
[05:06:00.960 --> 05:06:02.960]  Okay
[05:06:03.300 --> 05:06:09.220]  Yeah, yeah, we'll keep that cat in the back for right now all right, so let's yeah, let's start with take some calls
[05:06:09.220 --> 05:06:12.460]  We'll start with Dan not Dan. Excuse me Brad in Michigan
[05:06:13.940 --> 05:06:20.060]  How you guys doing today very well very way, I'm a first-time caller, but I'm a listener for life. Oh
[05:06:21.900 --> 05:06:25.500]  I just wanted to talk about the
[05:06:26.220 --> 05:06:28.220]  Incidences have been happening in the past
[05:06:28.220 --> 05:06:33.300]  week or so and I remember you guys had Alex Jones had a
[05:06:33.580 --> 05:06:36.340]  His son on there, and he was talking about how they
[05:06:37.620 --> 05:06:39.620]  destabilize the regions over in the Middle East
[05:06:40.220 --> 05:06:47.300]  And I was just curious is that something that could I have this feeling that it's gonna be coming this way
[05:06:48.980 --> 05:06:50.980]  Well I mean
[05:06:50.980 --> 05:06:53.260]  Just look at some of the just look at some of the news
[05:06:53.260 --> 05:06:56.780]  It was breaking in the last couple of days there was an article on drug report where they were
[05:06:56.780 --> 05:07:02.060]  Saying it was essentially the Syrian president saying you guys are using al-qaeda
[05:07:02.060 --> 05:07:06.500]  And al-qaeda is gonna come back to bite you in America and bite you in Western Europe and everything
[05:07:06.500 --> 05:07:12.540]  It's like hey, and he pointed out, and this is you know very well the people are talking about this he pointed out that
[05:07:13.460 --> 05:07:15.460]  the u.s.. Created al-qaeda
[05:07:15.600 --> 05:07:17.600]  to go against the Russians and
[05:07:17.700 --> 05:07:23.280]  So but the question is were they ever not in control of that. That's really the question
[05:07:23.280 --> 05:07:28.580]  We know they created them. We know that they use them to overthrow Libya. We know they're using them in Syria
[05:07:28.580 --> 05:07:30.740]  They're sending money to them even though
[05:07:30.740 --> 05:07:36.740]  We are supposedly and we truly are in dire straits as far as money goes as far as sequester goes we are broke
[05:07:36.740 --> 05:07:43.880]  And we're printing money and borrowing money from the Federal Reserve banks and paying them tremendous amounts of interest so that we can
[05:07:44.180 --> 05:07:49.020]  Send that money then to al-qaeda is absolutely an insane foreign policy
[05:07:49.020 --> 05:07:54.540]  And just look at al-qaeda the free Syrian army as they are as they are referred to in Syria
[05:07:54.860 --> 05:07:57.900]  They're recruiting children who were playing with dynamite in ak-47
[05:07:58.380 --> 05:08:01.620]  Syrian girl has been on here talking about how the Syrian army is
[05:08:01.980 --> 05:08:08.420]  Raping people the free Syrian army is raping young women and young girls even they're beating up old men in the streets
[05:08:08.420 --> 05:08:13.720]  You can find all that stuff on Syrian girls a partisan channel. I believe it's called on YouTube, and I gotta say
[05:08:14.300 --> 05:08:16.300]  We looked at this press conference
[05:08:16.500 --> 05:08:18.500]  not a press conference, but
[05:08:18.500 --> 05:08:24.020]  representative Duncan questioning Janet Napolitano about this Saudi person of interest and
[05:08:24.620 --> 05:08:26.300]  When I first heard that
[05:08:26.300 --> 05:08:32.140]  You know the reports were that they grabbed a Saudi guy because he was running and of course everybody's running doing that and I thought
[05:08:32.140 --> 05:08:36.220]  Well, they're just single this guy out because he's Arab, but then the fact that they would deport him
[05:08:36.220 --> 05:08:42.680]  I find that to be the most suspicious thing about it get him out of here as we know that it was Saudis that
[05:08:43.340 --> 05:08:46.260]  They used as the narrative for 9-eleven
[05:08:46.260 --> 05:08:52.140]  You know whatever their involvement was of course we know they found all their passports immediately afterwards some of them laying on top of the heat
[05:08:52.140 --> 05:08:54.100]  So they yeah
[05:08:54.100 --> 05:08:58.660]  but you know that there's been this kind of connection in the past just as there has been with al-qaeda and
[05:08:59.340 --> 05:09:05.580]  So I find that to be even more suspicious than the initial reports all right, and thank you for your call Brad
[05:09:05.580 --> 05:09:10.420]  We'll we'll take calls until the press conference starts. We'll go to Chris in, California
[05:09:10.420 --> 05:09:19.020]  I got doing today very well. I'm just quick question. I don't know if you guys have to look at YouTube
[05:09:19.780 --> 05:09:26.060]  About Charlie Chaplin appreciate it. I'm sorry. I can't hear you. Can you get a little closer to your phone? Oh, yeah?
[05:09:27.100 --> 05:09:30.180]  Charlie Charlie Chaplin, I don't know if you guys
[05:09:31.180 --> 05:09:35.060]  Watched his video on YouTube message to the humanity
[05:09:35.060 --> 05:09:42.700]  Are you talking about the original Charlie Chaplin or is this something? Yeah? I mean that I'm not really sure somebody
[05:09:45.260 --> 05:09:47.380]  Original but there's a video on YouTube
[05:09:48.060 --> 05:09:51.300]  Message to humanity, and it's I mean it's a pretty good video
[05:09:51.300 --> 05:09:55.540]  I don't know if you guys didn't look at it, or maybe my house has no. I haven't seen what's the video about?
[05:09:56.540 --> 05:10:00.180]  it's just talked about how he doesn't want to be dictator and
[05:10:00.180 --> 05:10:05.580]  He wants people to wake up from all the chaos and corruption that's going on with the world
[05:10:05.780 --> 05:10:08.460]  That's about a three minute and thirty second clip
[05:10:09.220 --> 05:10:12.560]  Okay, and you said it's so can you tell us the title one more time?
[05:10:13.700 --> 05:10:20.860]  Charlie Charlie Chaplin message to you. Okay. Thank you for your call Chris. We're gonna move on to Sam in, Ohio
[05:10:22.700 --> 05:10:24.700]  Are you doing doing very well
[05:10:24.700 --> 05:10:31.820]  Good, I was calling in to make sure people were informed of the act of 1871
[05:10:32.660 --> 05:10:33.780]  which
[05:10:33.780 --> 05:10:36.780]  Turned the United States into a corporation
[05:10:37.420 --> 05:10:39.420]  two constitutions
[05:10:39.460 --> 05:10:45.700]  Now are in place the organic Constitution and the corporate Constitution
[05:10:47.740 --> 05:10:51.860]  You said the act of 1871 yes, sir, okay, go ahead and
[05:10:51.860 --> 05:10:53.300]  and
[05:10:53.300 --> 05:10:57.700]  This is very important because with the act of 1871
[05:10:58.740 --> 05:11:00.740]  the corporate constitution is
[05:11:01.740 --> 05:11:03.920]  operating and private international law
[05:11:04.780 --> 05:11:07.160]  our original organic Constitution
[05:11:08.780 --> 05:11:12.700]  Was not to operate in private international law
[05:11:12.820 --> 05:11:16.900]  So I just wanted to put that up out there so people can check that out themselves
[05:11:16.900 --> 05:11:22.140]  I feel that's very important for all Americans to know the truth well
[05:11:22.140 --> 05:11:28.140]  We certainly have the narrative that we've heard over and over again about the Constitution being a living document that they're not bound to
[05:11:28.140 --> 05:11:31.740]  It and and and now we have a lot of people coming out and just saying well
[05:11:31.740 --> 05:11:35.140]  Let's get rid of the Second Amendment. Let's get rid of the Constitution. Let's not be bound by it
[05:11:36.020 --> 05:11:38.020]  You know we need to make sure that
[05:11:38.940 --> 05:11:41.700]  The the Constitution is being obeyed
[05:11:41.700 --> 05:11:48.940]  Exactly in a good example of what she's talking about is that movie network where I do believe we may have that audio clip where?
[05:11:49.020 --> 05:11:53.660]  Mr.. Howard Beale is getting the lecture about there is no United States. There is no Canada
[05:11:53.660 --> 05:12:01.500]  There's only IBM and AT&T and and this and that and that's a very real very true statement in that film that film network
[05:12:01.500 --> 05:12:05.700]  Yeah, okay, we'll move on. Thank you for your call Sam. We'll move on to Dennis in Colorado
[05:12:07.660 --> 05:12:09.660]  Hello
[05:12:09.660 --> 05:12:11.660]  Yes, are you?
[05:12:12.660 --> 05:12:14.660]  Yes, go ahead with your call
[05:12:15.340 --> 05:12:21.740]  Well, you know this has been going on for years. I mean even from Vietnam
[05:12:21.740 --> 05:12:25.500]  you know when they say they don't do landmines don't warn they got the
[05:12:26.660 --> 05:12:33.500]  These baseball-sized things that pops up and kill people you know and the government's been a lot of conspiracy
[05:12:33.500 --> 05:12:39.140]  Absolutely this isn't the first time this has happened in Boston or oh no
[05:12:39.140 --> 05:12:43.900]  We go or wherever and if you go back if you can you can probably find it online
[05:12:44.340 --> 05:12:46.380]  If you don't have a physical copy of it
[05:12:46.380 --> 05:12:52.900]  But the very first info Wars magazine Kurt Nemo wrote a very good article about the history of false flags
[05:12:52.900 --> 05:12:55.860]  And he basically took it up to about the time of the Vietnam War
[05:12:56.460 --> 05:13:01.900]  There were a ton of false flag incidents there all of which have now been
[05:13:01.900 --> 05:13:08.300]  Declassified things like operation Gladio up and Northwoods those sorts of things as well as
[05:13:08.660 --> 05:13:11.500]  golf at the the Gulf of Tonkin exactly so
[05:13:12.140 --> 05:13:16.740]  There but there have been a lot more since then and so we're going to be updating that article
[05:13:17.300 --> 05:13:19.300]  Watch for that
[05:13:19.460 --> 05:13:22.760]  All right, thank you for your call move back to Bruce in Canada
[05:13:23.900 --> 05:13:29.020]  Hello, yes, oh hey. How do I sound now? You do sound much better? Go ahead
[05:13:29.020 --> 05:13:32.540]  I excellent excellent. Let's just cut right to the gym here then gentlemen
[05:13:33.340 --> 05:13:40.980]  Last last week exactly one week ago today three days before the bombing the government re-released the tape where Adam Gadon
[05:13:41.100 --> 05:13:48.140]  the grandson of the ADL called for lone wolf attacks to cause mass casualties using whatever means obtainable and
[05:13:48.940 --> 05:13:56.100]  MSNBC show Morning Joe ran text on screen three days before the attack on April 11th the text on screen
[05:13:56.100 --> 05:13:59.420]  Said video draws attention to potential terror threat
[05:14:00.300 --> 05:14:02.580]  You know can you give us the day give us that date?
[05:14:02.580 --> 05:14:07.700]  It's gun control bill got loaded down Adam got on and he said you could go arm yourself
[05:14:08.020 --> 05:14:13.280]  With a fully automatic weapon had a gun show with no paperwork in the video a total lie
[05:14:13.280 --> 05:14:20.180]  But it's extremely convenient wouldn't you say I mean the other boogeyman are dead after all you can't say old and war
[05:14:20.180 --> 05:14:27.900]  I'll lackey the CIA lackey was the bombers handler anymore like he did in Times Square, or he did at Fort Fort Hood
[05:14:28.260 --> 05:14:34.060]  Right Osama bin. Goldstein can't rise from the grave to help Obama politically like he did with Bush
[05:14:35.220 --> 05:14:40.180]  Conveniently Adam was linked to Fort Hood shooting before they killed the last guy with the predator drone
[05:14:40.180 --> 05:14:47.500]  And who released the tape days before the bomb you know the government who's desperate to link the Tea Party and libertarians?
[05:14:47.500 --> 05:14:50.100]  with terrorist groups the government
[05:14:50.180 --> 05:14:54.560]  So let's blow a hole in what their official narrative would have been days ago
[05:14:54.780 --> 05:15:02.100]  You know let's stand in front like this is incredible lots of publications already saying it was some patriot type fellow
[05:15:02.260 --> 05:15:06.540]  Like that's the automatic thing you go to now. I mean the script is now
[05:15:07.060 --> 05:15:15.060]  Officially flipped I mean all it takes now is a tie a freethinking patriot minded Patsy on an event like Patriots Day
[05:15:15.060 --> 05:15:19.380]  to some CIA out the guy like
[05:15:20.060 --> 05:15:26.600]  Adam you know Adam get Don and just say I don't get Don was the bombers handler because you can't do that with the last guy
[05:15:27.000 --> 05:15:29.660]  Died right so check this video out
[05:15:30.180 --> 05:15:37.780]  Here's the hello. Yes. Go ahead there. Here's here's the text of it unbelievable video most wanted al-qaeda terrorists
[05:15:37.780 --> 05:15:44.740]  Adam did on likes the NRA. That's the text of the YouTube video is a 60-second like gun control
[05:15:45.340 --> 05:15:52.740]  Video that al-qaeda made conveniently before their last agenda. I mean I just I see right through this you know
[05:15:53.740 --> 05:15:58.980]  Alright, thank you. We'll check that out. I will move on now to Dennis in, Texas
[05:16:01.020 --> 05:16:02.820]  Hi there
[05:16:02.820 --> 05:16:04.580]  Yes, go ahead
[05:16:04.580 --> 05:16:06.260]  Okay, great
[05:16:06.260 --> 05:16:11.220]  I've got a couple of things for you. I worked in the Middle East for almost 38 years
[05:16:12.140 --> 05:16:13.820]  I've worked with
[05:16:13.820 --> 05:16:16.060]  the various agencies and
[05:16:17.900 --> 05:16:19.900]  Operating companies and operators
[05:16:20.940 --> 05:16:25.860]  You're very correct about the uniform that these people were wearing
[05:16:26.740 --> 05:16:34.820]  If you looked you'll probably find that they came from a company called 511 and boots are Danner
[05:16:34.820 --> 05:16:36.820]  the stuff
[05:16:37.060 --> 05:16:41.900]  PG and the tactical pants of the 511 it's a five-in-one
[05:16:42.700 --> 05:16:46.060]  Jacket and their caps you're correct
[05:16:47.180 --> 05:16:50.380]  As to the logo and everything the Saudis
[05:16:51.540 --> 05:16:53.540]  Don't operate with
[05:16:54.140 --> 05:16:58.100]  US Navy SEALs they actually operate with the F
[05:16:58.100 --> 05:17:04.260]  the special boat service or FAS never yeah, it would be the essay I say
[05:17:04.980 --> 05:17:06.980]  UK and
[05:17:07.260 --> 05:17:14.020]  And what I what I would suggest is that if we really want to get to the bottom of this
[05:17:15.420 --> 05:17:18.780]  The people that are identified in the photos
[05:17:19.420 --> 05:17:20.740]  should be
[05:17:20.740 --> 05:17:24.580]  Should be identified and brought forward and they should
[05:17:24.580 --> 05:17:27.540]  Provide a critique for
[05:17:28.780 --> 05:17:31.620]  What happened during that operation and why it failed?
[05:17:32.140 --> 05:17:35.460]  and what the intent of the operation was and
[05:17:36.340 --> 05:17:38.340]  They all work for us
[05:17:38.380 --> 05:17:41.860]  absolutely, there's no reason that they shouldn't be trotted out and
[05:17:43.740 --> 05:17:49.600]  Should provide a critique and if the government if the government is going to tell us that they need to take our
[05:17:49.600 --> 05:17:56.240]  liberties so that it can make us secure then they need to give us an explanation as to why when they have that many people and
[05:17:56.440 --> 05:18:00.600]  That concentrated in that area, and they were so totally ineffective
[05:18:01.280 --> 05:18:05.320]  When they were apparently were looking and expecting something from all reports
[05:18:05.320 --> 05:18:09.560]  Yeah, and I believe the the agency that the guys allegedly worked for was called craft
[05:18:10.080 --> 05:18:12.720]  Was that correct somebody had mentioned that somebody mentioned that?
[05:18:13.520 --> 05:18:16.320]  There's there's a lot of different companies, you know
[05:18:17.280 --> 05:18:18.560]  but
[05:18:18.560 --> 05:18:22.880]  We're paying these people and they're they're kind of Cowboys
[05:18:24.480 --> 05:18:26.480]  In the Middle East and
[05:18:27.080 --> 05:18:34.160]  the although all the companies that were under God were brought under the UCMJ, but
[05:18:35.720 --> 05:18:36.800]  The
[05:18:36.800 --> 05:18:42.520]  There was one company working for the State Department that wasn't brought under the UCMJ
[05:18:42.640 --> 05:18:47.020]  And they're the people's the people that became Cowboys over there
[05:18:47.020 --> 05:18:53.800]  They're the people that got killed in Fallujah. There's and they're the reason that Fallujah was destroyed
[05:18:54.940 --> 05:19:00.340]  Basically, these people got out of they got scared. They thought they were surrounded
[05:19:00.340 --> 05:19:06.940]  They just shot in all directions. The people became outraged and they got hung from the bridge and we
[05:19:07.900 --> 05:19:09.900]  our military
[05:19:10.780 --> 05:19:14.820]  Destroyed Fallujah for that for that reason I watched it. All right
[05:19:14.820 --> 05:19:18.860]  All right now I do believe we have some activity at the press conference. Thank you for your call
[05:19:19.820 --> 05:19:25.940]  Seems like we have some activities and looks like somebody's coming in the number to call in is eight seven seven seven eight nine
[05:19:26.220 --> 05:19:30.580]  Alex that is eight seven seven seven eight nine two five three nine
[05:19:30.740 --> 05:19:34.140]  Well, they started filing in and now the guys just standing at the door
[05:19:34.140 --> 05:19:39.100]  So I guess we can take more calls. Sorry to the last caller still putting the finishing touches on that story
[05:19:39.100 --> 05:19:40.460]  I guess that they were gonna break yesterday
[05:19:40.460 --> 05:19:45.700]  Yeah, they know people were slowly coming in and just all three people walk through the door. It looks like some more coming in
[05:19:45.940 --> 05:19:47.860]  So we'll we just want to be ready
[05:19:47.860 --> 05:19:53.940]  Yeah, like the gentleman said there were similarities to the the group name named Kraft with those
[05:19:54.520 --> 05:20:00.660]  Alleged soldiers. We don't know that for sure that they were actually connected to the group, but there are some similarities in their appearance
[05:20:01.500 --> 05:20:04.060]  Just to comment on what the last caller said
[05:20:05.460 --> 05:20:07.260]  We're still waiting for
[05:20:07.260 --> 05:20:13.020]  Some grand poobah to make their entrance they've got a shot of the cameraman standing here at the entrance to the door waiting
[05:20:13.020 --> 05:20:17.440]  They're guys to come guys ready. No one is coming. All right, so we'll go back to our call line
[05:20:17.440 --> 05:20:19.440]  We'll go to Jim in New York
[05:20:22.100 --> 05:20:24.100]  Hello Jim
[05:20:24.300 --> 05:20:29.540]  Well, never we have Jim, okay. All right. Well Jim Jim just stay right there Jim stay right there. Let's get audio guys
[05:20:29.540 --> 05:20:36.140]  You we're waiting for him to say something there we go
[05:20:38.980 --> 05:20:44.420]  Good afternoon, my name is Richard Deloria and I am the special agent in charge of the FBI's Boston division
[05:20:45.060 --> 05:20:51.580]  Since Monday's bombing is the FBI and our law enforcement partners have been working around the clock and are fully committed to investigating the matter
[05:20:51.620 --> 05:20:54.500]  This matter to bring those responsible to justice
[05:20:54.980 --> 05:20:58.820]  Our collective law enforcement team has pursued thousands of leads and tips
[05:20:58.820 --> 05:21:06.100]  As I said two days ago, we are working methodically and with a sense of urgency to identify those responsible for the bombings
[05:21:06.660 --> 05:21:12.700]  Within the last day or so through our care through that careful process. We initially developed a single person of interest
[05:21:13.220 --> 05:21:16.660]  Not knowing that the individual was acting alone or in concert with others
[05:21:16.660 --> 05:21:20.020]  We obviously worked with extreme purpose to make that determination
[05:21:20.940 --> 05:21:27.620]  The entire force of the federal government the FBI in Boston around the world as well as our partners in the Boston Police
[05:21:27.620 --> 05:21:29.180]  ATF
[05:21:29.180 --> 05:21:35.700]  Massachusetts State Police and more than 30 agencies of the Boston Joint Terrorism Task Force have set about to ensure that all
[05:21:35.900 --> 05:21:38.660]  Responsible for the bombings will be brought to justice
[05:21:39.740 --> 05:21:46.720]  More importantly it was done to ensure the future safety of the city of Boston the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and the country
[05:21:47.380 --> 05:21:51.900]  Indeed through that process the FBI developed a second subject subject suspect
[05:21:52.900 --> 05:21:56.300]  Today we are listing the public's help to identify the two suspects
[05:21:56.300 --> 05:22:03.460]  Just after a very detailed analysis of photo video and other evidence. We are releasing photos of these two suspects
[05:22:03.880 --> 05:22:07.140]  They are identified as suspect one and suspect two
[05:22:07.780 --> 05:22:09.780]  They appear to be associated
[05:22:10.660 --> 05:22:12.660]  Suspect one is wearing a dark hat
[05:22:13.320 --> 05:22:15.320]  Suspect two is wearing a white hat
[05:22:16.020 --> 05:22:22.580]  Suspect two set down a backpack at the site of the second explosion just in front of the forum restaurant
[05:22:22.580 --> 05:22:24.580]  We
[05:22:24.600 --> 05:22:30.820]  Strongly encourage those who were at the forum restaurant who have not contacted contacted us yet to do so
[05:22:31.580 --> 05:22:37.120]  As you can see from one of the open from one of the images suspects one and two appear to be walking together
[05:22:37.160 --> 05:22:41.440]  Through the marathon crowd on Boylston Street and the direction of the finish line
[05:22:41.960 --> 05:22:47.860]  That image was captured as they walked on Boylston in the vicinity of the intersection with Gloucester Street
[05:22:47.860 --> 05:22:55.900]  As you can see the quality of the photos is quite good, but we will continue to work on developing additional images to improve their
[05:22:56.240 --> 05:22:58.240]  identification value
[05:22:58.540 --> 05:23:03.180]  Further on fbi.gov we have photos of the suspects
[05:23:03.580 --> 05:23:08.580]  The photos and videos are posted for the public and media to use review and publicize
[05:23:09.140 --> 05:23:15.900]  For clarity these images should be the only ones I emphasize the only ones that the public should view to assist us
[05:23:15.900 --> 05:23:23.180]  other photos should not be deemed credible and unless and they unnecessarily divert the public's attention in the wrong direction and
[05:23:23.460 --> 05:23:26.380]  Create undue work for vital law enforcement resources
[05:23:26.980 --> 05:23:32.380]  For more than 100 years the FBI has relied upon the public to be its eyes and ears
[05:23:33.260 --> 05:23:38.460]  With the media's help in an instant these images will be delivered directly into the hands of millions around the world
[05:23:39.020 --> 05:23:43.940]  We know the public will play a critical role in identifying and locating these individuals
[05:23:43.940 --> 05:23:51.740]  Somebody out there knows these individuals as friends neighbors co-workers or family members of the suspects
[05:23:52.140 --> 05:23:58.180]  Though it may be difficult the nation is counting on those with information to come forward and provide it to us
[05:24:00.780 --> 05:24:04.260]  They said look at these two bit of information no matter how small or
[05:24:05.060 --> 05:24:11.160]  Consequential the eye picture is too small for us to see each piece moves us forward towards justice
[05:24:11.160 --> 05:24:16.820]  It is extremely important to contact us with any information regarding the identities of suspect one
[05:24:17.440 --> 05:24:22.720]  Suspects who and their location we consider them to be armed and extremely dangerous
[05:24:23.800 --> 05:24:28.880]  No one should approach them. No one should attempt to apprehend them except law enforcement
[05:24:29.880 --> 05:24:34.380]  Let me iterate that reiterate that caution. Do not take any action on your own
[05:24:34.380 --> 05:24:41.900]  If you see these men contact law enforcement if you know anything about the bombings or the men picture here
[05:24:42.020 --> 05:24:47.180]  Please call the telephone listed on the photo arrays. That's 1-800-CALL-FBI
[05:24:47.700 --> 05:24:51.620]  Again, that's 1-800-225-5324
[05:24:52.140 --> 05:24:54.140]  All calls will be kept confidential
[05:24:54.860 --> 05:25:02.380]  We have also established a website for tips that directly relates to the bombing. Please contact. Please contact us at Boston
[05:25:02.380 --> 05:25:05.900]  Marathon tips dot FBI dot gov
[05:25:06.420 --> 05:25:11.780]  Again, that website is Boston Marathon tips dot FBI dot gov
[05:25:12.300 --> 05:25:15.460]  The photos can be viewed on our website FBI dot gov
[05:25:17.100 --> 05:25:23.300]  It is important to emphasize the images from Monday are indelible and the horror of that day will remain with us forever
[05:25:24.020 --> 05:25:30.780]  This further underscores our obligation to investigate this crime judiciously in order to bring these those responsible to justice
[05:25:30.780 --> 05:25:34.540]  The victims and the survivors deserve nothing more
[05:25:35.780 --> 05:25:42.380]  Nothing less. Excuse me as a as to Monday's victims. The FBI is committed to ensuring that victims receive the rights
[05:25:42.380 --> 05:25:45.740]  They are entitled to and the assistance they need to cope with the crime
[05:25:46.580 --> 05:25:54.020]  Treating victims with respect and providing them with assistance benefits benefits and help and and assistance will better our cases
[05:25:54.020 --> 05:26:01.220]  Our resources include an office of victim assistance at FBI headquarters and victim specialists nationwide
[05:26:01.820 --> 05:26:07.820]  These highly trained professionals can assist victims and coordinate with other agencies to provide victims with the support
[05:26:08.300 --> 05:26:11.440]  Information and resources necessary to effectively meet their needs
[05:26:11.940 --> 05:26:17.620]  Our victim specialist team continues to work around the clock to bring assistance to the victims of this heinous act
[05:26:17.620 --> 05:26:22.300]  Identifying and locating those responsible is now our highest priority
[05:26:22.820 --> 05:26:28.620]  No other details of the investment investigation will be released at this time because this is our focus now
[05:26:28.620 --> 05:26:30.620]  It continues to be an ongoing active
[05:26:31.500 --> 05:26:37.220]  investigation review these photographs and contact us at 1-800-CALL-FBI or
[05:26:37.220 --> 05:26:48.220]  www.bostonmarathontips.fbi.gov immediately. Thank you very much. Karen?
[05:26:54.220 --> 05:26:59.220]  I wouldn't want to comment on that Karen right now. I would allow US Attorney Ortiz to comment on that aspect
[05:26:59.220 --> 05:27:04.220]  Are you denying that those bombs rose Monday morning? We got photographs on Infowars.com folks
[05:27:05.220 --> 05:27:07.220]  Next question, please next question, please. Yes
[05:27:08.220 --> 05:27:13.220]  Are both suspects seen planting these devices at the finish line?
[05:27:14.220 --> 05:27:16.220]  No
[05:27:16.220 --> 05:27:21.220]  The only one who has observed planting what we believe to be the device is suspect number two with a white cap
[05:27:22.220 --> 05:27:24.220]  What time did they put those devices down?
[05:27:24.220 --> 05:27:30.220]  I don't have the precise time in front of me. It was shortly before the bomb blast went off within minutes
[05:27:35.220 --> 05:27:38.220]  At these time these are people of interest to the FBI
[05:27:38.220 --> 05:27:52.220]  Do you have any information on what they did after the explosions? Any indication they were around watching? Do you have any videos of them walking away?
[05:27:53.220 --> 05:28:01.220]  Suspect number two of what the white cap on proceeded west on Boylston Street and that's all we know right now
[05:28:01.220 --> 05:28:09.220]  Sir, can you address the, there are pictures today in newspapers all over the country including the New York Post that identified two men as potential suspects
[05:28:10.220 --> 05:28:15.220]  I'm just wondering what it does to your investigation when things like this get out and these guys are wrong?
[05:28:16.220 --> 05:28:24.220]  I think I addressed that, thank you and I think I addressed that question in my statement by saying the only photos that we officially relied upon in this investigation are those you see before you today
[05:28:24.220 --> 05:28:31.220]  If there are any dangers you stand by your statement that there is no additional danger to the public?
[05:28:32.220 --> 05:28:36.220]  I do stand by that statement right now. There's no additional imminent danger that we are aware of right now
[05:28:37.220 --> 05:28:39.220]  Okay, thank you
[05:28:40.220 --> 05:28:44.220]  They're ending the conference now. Dan Badani got a question in
[05:28:45.220 --> 05:28:51.220]  Again, the photos are available at FBI.gov. We'll have more information when we have something to release publicly
[05:28:51.220 --> 05:28:56.220]  We'll be back, but we'll let you know. Check our website, FBI.gov
[05:28:57.220 --> 05:28:59.220]  Sounds like Dan in the background
[05:29:00.220 --> 05:29:14.220]  So you heard the FBI guys say these are the only images that you need to focus on. These two guys out of everybody in the crowd
[05:29:14.220 --> 05:29:23.220]  And don't get me wrong, I'm sure the FBI is competent and definitely looking into the situation, but as Dan pointed out we have other images on Infowars.com
[05:29:24.220 --> 05:29:31.220]  There are images on other sites that may not be on Infowars.com of other people that may be included in the bombing
[05:29:32.220 --> 05:29:34.220]  I'm not as confident as you are in their competence
[05:29:34.220 --> 05:29:43.220]  Quite frankly, he said to go to FBI.gov, I went there with my iPad and Safari can't open because the server has stopped responding
[05:29:44.220 --> 05:29:50.220]  So they put all this on a webpage where they couldn't handle the traffic. Did they not anticipate that a lot of people might go there?
[05:29:51.220 --> 05:29:59.220]  I'm sure the writers or whoever will put the suspects on with our pictures that we have on Infowars.com
[05:29:59.220 --> 05:30:03.220]  But we didn't see any pictures of the stuff that's been floating around
[05:30:04.220 --> 05:30:05.220]  They didn't address that at all
[05:30:06.220 --> 05:30:12.220]  It's worth noting here that Peter King was saying we need to have more cameras, we need to have more cameras
[05:30:13.220 --> 05:30:17.220]  What he means by that is they need to have more government cameras, he thinks
[05:30:18.220 --> 05:30:23.220]  They do not want us taking pictures in public of them doing their job or even of a crime site
[05:30:23.220 --> 05:30:29.220]  And even when we get pictures of a crime site, they want to discount that and say those aren't officially taken by the FBI
[05:30:30.220 --> 05:30:31.220]  Don't look at those, don't talk about those
[05:30:32.220 --> 05:30:33.220]  And that's what Dan was trying to ask him
[05:30:34.220 --> 05:30:38.220]  There are other pictures here, tell us about why did you rule those out or whatever, they're not going to respond to that
[05:30:39.220 --> 05:30:43.220]  And I definitely can't wait to see that video when he sees Dan, he's like, oh man it's him again
[05:30:44.220 --> 05:30:45.220]  Who let that guy in here?
[05:30:46.220 --> 05:30:47.220]  Next question
[05:30:47.220 --> 05:30:53.220]  Okay, so I guess guys we will roll just to 5 o'clock just to make it good and even and take some calls on this
[05:30:54.220 --> 05:31:01.220]  The number to call in is 877-789, Alex that is 877-789-2539
[05:31:02.220 --> 05:31:05.220]  Jim in New York, did you have a chance to see the press conference?
[05:31:08.220 --> 05:31:09.220]  Hello, Jim in New York, are you there?
[05:31:10.220 --> 05:31:12.220]  I'm sending the Boston Bonnies, okay?
[05:31:13.220 --> 05:31:15.220]  I'm sorry, I think we missed the, yes, go ahead, start from the beginning
[05:31:15.220 --> 05:31:20.220]  Yeah, I had something very strange happen to me considering the Boston Bonnies, alright?
[05:31:21.220 --> 05:31:29.220]  I took advantage of the Paul Revere contest and I did a video and I shipped out two squatty potties to Governor Cuomo and Mayor Bloomberg
[05:31:30.220 --> 05:31:40.220]  This was Sunday, come Tuesday when the boxing board received my video on YouTube related and associated to everything that happened in Boston
[05:31:40.220 --> 05:31:46.220]  Can you say that again? You sent out two squatty potties and then what happened after that?
[05:31:47.220 --> 05:31:52.220]  I sent out two squatty potties Sunday morning at about 5 in the morning from Rochester, New York out in Henrietta
[05:31:53.220 --> 05:31:54.220]  Okay
[05:31:55.220 --> 05:31:59.220]  To Mayor Bloomberg and Governor Cuomo and I decorated the outside of the box, it was comical in nature, okay?
[05:31:59.220 --> 05:32:13.220]  So Tuesday I looked at my YouTube channel and it said related videos to the Paul Revere contest, the squatty potty winner contest, Governor Cuomo and Mayor Bloomberg
[05:32:14.220 --> 05:32:21.220]  When I clicked on related videos, all the videos that were uploaded for the Boston bombing was related to me
[05:32:21.220 --> 05:32:31.220]  Now, the thing is this, if I'm a guy that wears a mask, I'm in a kilt and I asked another billionaire and I throw in some comedy satire and humor
[05:32:32.220 --> 05:32:37.220]  Yeah, before, Jim can you just hold on one second, can you just tell us the headline of your video so we can pull it up?
[05:32:38.220 --> 05:32:40.220]  Squatty potty contest winner
[05:32:41.220 --> 05:32:43.220]  Squatty potty contest winner guys, if we can pull that up on YouTube
[05:32:44.220 --> 05:32:45.220]  Yeah, New York City twin sphincters
[05:32:46.220 --> 05:32:47.220]  Okay, go ahead
[05:32:47.220 --> 05:32:54.220]  And do you want the channel name because it's the feature video and I'm not doing this for this, I can actually email you the pictures
[05:32:55.220 --> 05:33:02.220]  and a brief video or I'll try to upload a video type from my phone that I actually have the videos that were associated with me
[05:33:03.220 --> 05:33:10.220]  So number one, nothing in the title is associated with what happened on Monday, my video was uploaded Sunday
[05:33:10.220 --> 05:33:22.220]  I'm a guy that likes the constitution and I have done these videos pertaining to Obama, you know, radical Islam and everything else like this
[05:33:23.220 --> 05:33:27.220]  So for my video to be related, such a topic is absolutely horrendous
[05:33:28.220 --> 05:33:32.220]  And like I said, I'm not scared, I know the perils were in, it just kind of freaked me out
[05:33:33.220 --> 05:33:34.220]  Yeah, that's interesting
[05:33:34.220 --> 05:33:43.220]  When it came to the meta tagging, the meta tagging was Paul Revere contest, NWL New World Order, Alex Jones contest winner
[05:33:44.220 --> 05:33:50.220]  Had nothing pertaining to do with Boston, now mind you, I did this day before, Tuesday
[05:33:51.220 --> 05:33:58.220]  That's interesting, now as part of the contest, typically it's a requirement that you put Infowars.com in the description
[05:33:58.220 --> 05:34:03.220]  Was that also there, you had a meta tag of Alex Jones, did you have Infowars.com in the description?
[05:34:04.220 --> 05:34:11.220]  Yes I did, I most definitely did that, you know, the squatty potty contest winners and the rest of the name
[05:34:12.220 --> 05:34:16.220]  And I'm thinking what is this, am I being set up as a potential future patsy?
[05:34:17.220 --> 05:34:23.220]  Because if you check out the video, I'm a guy who's animated with a mask and a kilt, stick, you know what I'm saying?
[05:34:24.220 --> 05:34:25.220]  It'll be interesting
[05:34:25.220 --> 05:34:34.220]  I'm trying to deliver the message in a different way as the typical, you know, New World Order, I'm trying to add some levity to it
[05:34:35.220 --> 05:34:37.220]  Right, right, yeah, comedy can be very effective
[05:34:38.220 --> 05:34:47.220]  It'll be interesting to see if any others that are tagged with Infowars or Alex Jones, if that was the thing that was doing it or exactly what tagged it over there
[05:34:48.220 --> 05:34:49.220]  Yeah, we'd have to see if any other videos
[05:34:50.220 --> 05:34:51.220]  Thanks for pointing that out, we'll take a look at that
[05:34:51.220 --> 05:34:54.220]  Yeah, we'll definitely take a look at that because we'd have to look at more entries
[05:34:55.220 --> 05:34:57.220]  It may not have just been yours if that was indeed the case, but we'll look into that
[05:34:58.220 --> 05:34:59.220]  Thank you for your call
[05:35:00.220 --> 05:35:07.220]  It might have been something as innocent as that and the fact that so many of the videos that Alex has done about this bombing have gone viral
[05:35:08.220 --> 05:35:08.220]  Oh yeah, recently
[05:35:09.220 --> 05:35:14.220]  And so they look at a viral video and topics on it and then they find that relationship there
[05:35:15.220 --> 05:35:16.220]  So that might have been the common thread, we'll have to take a look at that
[05:35:17.220 --> 05:35:19.220]  Alright, thank you for your call, we'll move on to Dennis in London
[05:35:19.220 --> 05:35:20.220]  Hi
[05:35:21.220 --> 05:35:22.220]  Hi, go ahead
[05:35:23.220 --> 05:35:29.220]  Yeah, I just wanted to say in the last few days there's been a lot of black helicopters in the skies above London
[05:35:30.220 --> 05:35:31.220]  And
[05:35:32.220 --> 05:35:33.220]  Anywhere in particular? Any location?
[05:35:34.220 --> 05:35:35.220]  There was a Thatcher funeral
[05:35:36.220 --> 05:35:37.220]  Oh yeah, that is correct
[05:35:38.220 --> 05:35:41.220]  Yeah, there's been that as well, but I mean we've been seeing them for a long time now
[05:35:41.220 --> 05:35:50.220]  Not just in the last few days, it's quite a common thing and people don't really talk about it, but it's happening a lot
[05:35:51.220 --> 05:36:02.220]  And there's one thing I want to say, I don't know if you're aware of it, but on the White House website there's Obama put his birth certificate up there
[05:36:03.220 --> 05:36:04.220]  Are you serious?
[05:36:05.220 --> 05:36:06.220]  Can we pull that up right now?
[05:36:07.220 --> 05:36:09.220]  Is that something new or is that the old photoshopped thing?
[05:36:09.220 --> 05:36:11.220]  Yeah, that's the photoshopped thing
[05:36:12.220 --> 05:36:15.220]  I think if you open it up in Adobe Illustrator you can see that it's made up of different layers
[05:36:16.220 --> 05:36:17.220]  Right, right, yeah
[05:36:18.220 --> 05:36:19.220]  Oh, so it's nothing recent, it's nothing recent is what you're saying
[05:36:20.220 --> 05:36:26.220]  Well, I only found it out last week, but the thing is I went on that website and within an hour I had police knocking on my door
[05:36:27.220 --> 05:36:29.220]  Really? Were they questioning you about that specifically?
[05:36:30.220 --> 05:36:34.220]  No, they didn't, they were asking me about other stuff in the area, but it was really dodgy
[05:36:34.220 --> 05:36:43.220]  It was one police officer by himself, he just kept staring really into my eyes and then he said he was going to knock on other doors in the building
[05:36:44.220 --> 05:36:46.220]  But when I looked out my window he had left
[05:36:47.220 --> 05:36:56.220]  Well, I tell you, you're talking about this in England, we had someone calling yesterday talking about changes that he's seeing in Canada
[05:36:56.220 --> 05:37:04.220]  As I was driving last night I heard picked up here on the local radio station is a program from a guy that's out of Australia
[05:37:05.220 --> 05:37:08.220]  And he was basically talking, they have something similar to the Utah Data Center
[05:37:09.220 --> 05:37:14.220]  And he was talking about how they were keeping track and spying on citizens in Australia
[05:37:15.220 --> 05:37:22.220]  And how many times they had set up patsies and done exactly the same sort of thing that we see done here by the FBI in the United States
[05:37:22.220 --> 05:37:30.220]  Where they would go out and get a patsy and you would find that all these guys around him that were organizing this failed attempt
[05:37:31.220 --> 05:37:36.220]  Were all government agents and they were planning it, they were funding it, they were training it
[05:37:37.220 --> 05:37:42.220]  And they were putting the whole thing out and at the last minute they pull it in and make a big press event out of it and arrest the patsy
[05:37:43.220 --> 05:37:48.220]  And he was saying that they're doing the same thing there, you know it's a global pattern and that's what we're talking about
[05:37:48.220 --> 05:37:55.220]  And that's why we talk about things like the new world order and we see things that are being done like the UN arms trade treaty
[05:37:56.220 --> 05:38:00.220]  I mean it is an agenda 21, these are things that are not just unique to the United States
[05:38:01.220 --> 05:38:07.220]  They may be driven primarily by a lot of power brokers that are located primarily in the United States but these are global issues
[05:38:08.220 --> 05:38:12.220]  Alright thank you for your call Dennis, now we're trying to talk specifically about the recent press conference
[05:38:12.220 --> 05:38:17.220]  If you have another topic that's fine but try to keep your comment brief because we want to talk about the recent press conference
[05:38:18.220 --> 05:38:20.220]  We'll move on to Brandon in Texas
[05:38:21.220 --> 05:38:23.220]  Hey Jacari can you hear me? Yes I can
[05:38:24.220 --> 05:38:29.220]  Okay yeah sorry this is not about the press conference but it is about what you guys are talking about
[05:38:30.220 --> 05:38:37.220]  I met you and Katie, we all came down here to protest Piers Morgan and I want to give you some information that you didn't really talk about
[05:38:37.220 --> 05:38:41.220]  Which was the Batman map about Sandy Hook
[05:38:42.220 --> 05:38:43.220]  Okay go ahead
[05:38:44.220 --> 05:38:48.220]  Okay now if you look at the whole thing have your listeners take a look at the map
[05:38:49.220 --> 05:38:53.220]  Sir before you get into that have you seen our article on Infowars.com about the Batman maps?
[05:38:54.220 --> 05:39:01.220]  Well you guys talk about the Sandy Hook which is fine, which is strike point one which it shows but all the symbolism on gossip
[05:39:01.220 --> 05:39:07.220]  We're on strike point four which is the Patriot symbolism, the object of thirteen objects in a circle
[05:39:08.220 --> 05:39:11.220]  Just like the George Washington flag you cross with the Delaware
[05:39:12.220 --> 05:39:16.220]  Now that's strike point four, strike point two is the far right of the pyramid
[05:39:17.220 --> 05:39:23.220]  Which was Alex going with Piers Morgan, they're going after the far right
[05:39:23.220 --> 05:39:30.220]  Strike point three was the head of the snake, we had the FPS Russia guy and other people getting whacked mysteriously
[05:39:31.220 --> 05:39:33.220]  Now we're on strike point four which is the Patriots
[05:39:34.220 --> 05:39:37.220]  Now we have strike point five which is the last one which is the capstone of the pyramid
[05:39:38.220 --> 05:39:43.220]  Which could be the elite can orchestrate attack on themselves to victimize themselves
[05:39:44.220 --> 05:39:48.220]  It's kind of hard to follow when we don't have a visual on it but you know what the best thing you can do
[05:39:49.220 --> 05:39:50.220]  Just Google the Batman map, that's all you got to do
[05:39:50.220 --> 05:39:54.220]  Yeah and it would be good if you got something to point out there
[05:39:55.220 --> 05:40:02.220]  Do a video of it or an article and send that to show tips and we'd be happy to take a look at that
[05:40:03.220 --> 05:40:06.220]  Alright thank you for your call Brandon, we'll move on now to Derek in Wisconsin
[05:40:07.220 --> 05:40:08.220]  Hi how are you guys doing?
[05:40:09.220 --> 05:40:10.220]  Very well
[05:40:11.220 --> 05:40:13.220]  I just want to thank you guys for what you're all doing
[05:40:14.220 --> 05:40:17.220]  Did you guys finish watching the CNN broadcast with Dan there?
[05:40:17.220 --> 05:40:19.220]  Yes, yes you noticed the emotional as well
[05:40:20.220 --> 05:40:22.220]  Did you see the two guys jump in front of him right away?
[05:40:23.220 --> 05:40:28.220]  You know that's what I wanted to see because we were watching it on CNN and I was wondering if maybe there was another news network that had an angle
[05:40:29.220 --> 05:40:33.220]  Because I could see somebody when the FBI guy was up, somebody walking behind him, looked like he was walking real fast
[05:40:34.220 --> 05:40:36.220]  Yeah there were two guys that went up in front of him and then I finished watching it before they cut it out
[05:40:37.220 --> 05:40:42.220]  And by the end of the feed Dan had like a group of reporters and cameras around him
[05:40:43.220 --> 05:40:44.220]  And he was all yelling about that
[05:40:44.220 --> 05:40:49.220]  Well I'm sure we have that recorded on various channels and we can set it up
[05:40:50.220 --> 05:40:54.220]  We may not have it tonight for the nightly news but I'm sure by some time tomorrow we can get those clips together
[05:40:55.220 --> 05:40:57.220]  Real quick question if I could
[05:40:58.220 --> 05:41:05.220]  For an average person wanting to start out as far as doing what you guys are doing
[05:41:06.220 --> 05:41:07.220]  It just seems like blogging and websites isn't enough
[05:41:08.220 --> 05:41:10.220]  What do you guys suggest for the average person to do?
[05:41:10.220 --> 05:41:17.220]  Well I'll tell you how I got turned on to this information was watching documentaries
[05:41:18.220 --> 05:41:22.220]  Not necessarily Alex's documentaries but documentaries especially some of his older stuff
[05:41:23.220 --> 05:41:26.220]  Because you talk about Alex Jones and they want to talk about you know the stuff he's talking about today
[05:41:27.220 --> 05:41:29.220]  Well the FBI says it's these two guys and Alex Jones is saying hey look at these guys
[05:41:30.220 --> 05:41:35.220]  Go back find some old school Alex Jones footage like there's a clip of Alex Jones I can't remember what movie it's in
[05:41:35.220 --> 05:41:41.220]  But he's telling people back in the 90s that they're going to start putting microphones and cameras on streetlights
[05:41:42.220 --> 05:41:44.220]  And people are like oh you're crazy Alex Jones and now that stuff's admitted
[05:41:45.220 --> 05:41:49.220]  So I would go watch that old stuff so you can see how the things he actually talks about back in the day have actually come true
[05:41:50.220 --> 05:41:55.220]  But are you asking how you could get involved in helping inform people is that what you're asking?
[05:41:56.220 --> 05:42:01.220]  Well yeah because it seems like you can build a blog and website but it just doesn't seem like enough
[05:42:01.220 --> 05:42:04.220]  I mean anybody can redistribute information
[05:42:05.220 --> 05:42:11.220]  Well that's true but I would take a look at some of the really gutsy stuff that Luke Rudowski's doing
[05:42:12.220 --> 05:42:16.220]  I mean you know you're going to have to do something like that and get out there
[05:42:17.220 --> 05:42:22.220]  But you know if you put yourself out there yeah if you sit in your basement and you write blogs and stuff that's really not going to do it
[05:42:23.220 --> 05:42:26.220]  But if you get out there and get on to Texas and get a job with you guys
[05:42:26.220 --> 05:42:31.220]  Well into the Paul Revere contest you may do just that but like David was saying
[05:42:32.220 --> 05:42:36.220]  Things that we are changing, things that Project Veritas is doing those are great
[05:42:37.220 --> 05:42:40.220]  You know out in the street reports you have to go out there that's what it is
[05:42:41.220 --> 05:42:44.220]  I mean it's great to do your blog and your writing and all that stuff
[05:42:45.220 --> 05:42:49.220]  But even we like to be out in the streets more but we have to run a show and we have to get all this other stuff together
[05:42:50.220 --> 05:42:54.220]  Get out in the streets go out there and confront your city councilman, your mayor, your governor, your police chief
[05:42:54.220 --> 05:42:57.220]  That's what it is and that's what's going to get you the hits
[05:42:58.220 --> 05:42:59.220]  We definitely appreciate your call
[05:43:00.220 --> 05:43:02.220]  We'll move on now to Jeff and is that Montreal?
[05:43:03.220 --> 05:43:05.220]  Yes I'm in Montreal Canada thank you for taking my call gentlemen how are you guys?
[05:43:06.220 --> 05:43:07.220]  Very well
[05:43:08.220 --> 05:43:10.220]  Good it's so nice to meet you Mr. Jackson and Mr. Knight finally
[05:43:11.220 --> 05:43:15.220]  I just wanted to make some remarks about the press conference if I could?
[05:43:16.220 --> 05:43:17.220]  Sure go ahead
[05:43:17.220 --> 05:43:24.220]  Did you notice the or some observation did you notice the first gentleman the first suspect is wearing a ball cap with a logo on it?
[05:43:25.220 --> 05:43:32.220]  Yes he didn't look like just the way he was dressed he didn't look like the other guys we've been talking about but I didn't notice some similarities in that but go ahead
[05:43:33.220 --> 05:43:34.220]  Tan pants but not tan shoes
[05:43:35.220 --> 05:43:39.220]  Exactly so you know there's just that enough that they throw in there to throw you off
[05:43:40.220 --> 05:43:44.220]  Conveniently they all were wearing ball caps so that's good I'm glad they got that together
[05:43:44.220 --> 05:43:48.220]  But these have to be the quickest press conferences ever
[05:43:49.220 --> 05:43:50.220]  Yes
[05:43:51.220 --> 05:43:53.220]  Dan keeps shutting these guys down I love it
[05:43:54.220 --> 05:44:04.220]  You know he hasn't called us yet we're kind of expecting a call from him and I think he's probably holding his own press conference it's probably going to last longer than the one the FBI
[05:44:05.220 --> 05:44:09.220]  You guys definitely let us know if we can't get him on we'll try to get him on maybe the nightly news
[05:44:10.220 --> 05:44:12.220]  Okay yeah but did you have any other comments on that Jeff?
[05:44:12.220 --> 05:44:22.220]  Well I just think that it was incredibly obvious that the FBI special agent was extremely nervous you could tell by his voice
[05:44:23.220 --> 05:44:33.220]  I would like to ask you a couple of questions why did they wait until 5pm to show the American public and the world that they have suspects these two suspects
[05:44:34.220 --> 05:44:39.220]  You would think that they would just release that right away I mean get this out be on the lookout kind of stuff
[05:44:39.220 --> 05:44:50.220]  And my second question is for you guys to answer perhaps is why is Israel sending in experts to help the Boston Police Department or the FBI
[05:44:51.220 --> 05:44:52.220]  I was not aware of that
[05:44:53.220 --> 05:44:56.220]  Did they announce that or was that something you saw somewhere else I didn't catch that in the press conference
[05:44:57.220 --> 05:44:58.220]  I'm not aware of that
[05:44:58.220 --> 05:45:09.220]  Jackson I read that on the internet today I believe it was on the extreme media you can look for yourselves Google Israel sending in experts to help the FBI
[05:45:10.220 --> 05:45:14.220]  Just bizarre stuff I was wondering if you guys could check that out for us
[05:45:15.220 --> 05:45:17.220]  Do you have any source CBS ABC anything in particular
[05:45:18.220 --> 05:45:23.220]  Well I'm going to take a look here I've been posting this stuff on Facebook all day but let me take a look here
[05:45:23.220 --> 05:45:29.220]  I can imagine they would justify that by saying that there's been so many civilian bombings in Israel these people have had some experience on it
[05:45:30.220 --> 05:45:36.220]  But who knows about that but in terms of why they would wait until this point to put out that little information
[05:45:37.220 --> 05:45:42.220]  I think it really goes back to the fact that they were originally scheduled to do this 24 hours ago
[05:45:43.220 --> 05:45:48.220]  And it was after we picked up those pictures that they changed the schedule
[05:45:48.220 --> 05:45:52.220]  And we started talking about those different pictures and to me it was
[05:45:53.220 --> 05:45:58.220]  All he said in the press conference was we've got two pictures of individuals ignore everything else you've heard
[05:45:59.220 --> 05:46:03.220]  And when Dan tried to ask him follow up questions on that he shut Dan down
[05:46:04.220 --> 05:46:05.220]  Then shut the conference down
[05:46:06.220 --> 05:46:07.220]  Shut the conference down because you can't shut Dan down
[05:46:08.220 --> 05:46:09.220]  Yeah you can't shut Dan down
[05:46:10.220 --> 05:46:11.220]  Well we'll definitely look into that Jeff thank you for your call
[05:46:12.220 --> 05:46:13.220]  Alright now once again
[05:46:14.220 --> 05:46:15.220]  Hey guys I just got to say I'm going to cover this on the nightly news
[05:46:15.220 --> 05:46:17.220]  This is a desperate cover up
[05:46:18.220 --> 05:46:19.220]  You're just putting rabbit trails out left and right
[05:46:20.220 --> 05:46:21.220]  We've got the people
[05:46:22.220 --> 05:46:23.220]  We've got the patsy the redneck they were going to burn
[05:46:24.220 --> 05:46:26.220]  That they pulled the military up to grab out of the courthouse
[05:46:27.220 --> 05:46:29.220]  We've got them with the Saudis everything they are shut down man
[05:46:30.220 --> 05:46:31.220]  They are in disarray right now
[05:46:32.220 --> 05:46:34.220]  So the good news is they're not blaming us right now for this
[05:46:35.220 --> 05:46:38.220]  And again they just want to like keep throwing distractions out and say
[05:46:39.220 --> 05:46:42.220]  Please don't look at any other photos that are out there i.e. coalwars.com
[05:46:42.220 --> 05:46:46.220]  Janet Napolitano is in congress do not look at Drudge who's carrying our stuff
[05:46:47.220 --> 05:46:49.220]  We are engaging the globalist at point mike range right now
[05:46:50.220 --> 05:46:51.220]  Thank you Alex

[05:47:53.220 --> 05:47:55.220]  By the way the viewers we're overwhelmed we can't upload all this to YouTube
[05:47:56.220 --> 05:48:00.220]  Listeners you clip all this out put the juicy clips on YouTube we'll put them on infowars.com
[05:48:01.220 --> 05:48:02.220]  When everybody's help this is war room baby
[05:48:03.220 --> 05:48:04.220]  Yep
[05:48:05.220 --> 05:48:06.220]  Infowars is shutting their ass down
[05:48:06.220 --> 05:48:08.220]  Alex Jones is very
[05:48:09.220 --> 05:48:16.220]  Alright there's Dan Madondi alright Dan Dan Dan alright start at the beginning so you're sitting there and the press conference starts and then what happens?
[05:48:17.220 --> 05:48:20.220]  I'm sitting here in the press conference I'm holding the photos and one of you I heard from the FBI agents
[05:48:21.220 --> 05:48:22.220]  They said no photos
[05:48:23.220 --> 05:48:25.220]  Then they come back right away and they're saying explain it
[05:48:26.220 --> 05:48:31.220]  Dan I know you're excited but don't talk so loud it's over driving just relax and talk slowly
[05:48:31.220 --> 05:48:42.220]  Hi I'm a little excited here I was sitting in my football pond here and gave me a bunch of spoon colored state by ten photos of the suspects basically
[05:48:43.220 --> 05:48:49.220]  And one of the FBI agents quoted one of the guys he never knew what to think of photos because he was eyeing me the whole time I was here
[05:48:50.220 --> 05:48:54.220]  So they come out right away they're doing all the photos except on the FBI's website
[05:48:54.220 --> 05:49:01.220]  And when I jumped out to ask the questions of course you had to pull the press conference again because they could not answer the real truth
[05:49:02.220 --> 05:49:07.220]  Okay Dan so you start asking your questions now were you surrounded were you mobbed by the FBI guys?
[05:49:08.220 --> 05:49:12.220]  Oh yeah they come right up to me like a bunch of Gestapo's I tell them I'm not afraid of you criminals
[05:49:13.220 --> 05:49:14.220]  So about how many
[05:49:15.220 --> 05:49:17.220]  They think they could use a skilled toxic against us
[05:49:18.220 --> 05:49:20.220]  Yeah Dan about how many people do you think there were that surrounded you?
[05:49:20.220 --> 05:49:26.220]  I should say to everybody up in the front I mean you should never see it on the news I was just too excited at the time
[05:49:27.220 --> 05:49:34.220]  And I'll just say it's crazy over here I mean we got cops steering us over here I got two guys that were running video cameras the whole time
[05:49:35.220 --> 05:49:37.220]  Hopefully they make it safely out of Boston
[05:49:38.220 --> 05:49:48.220]  Dan we had some reports that after the FBI spokesperson left that there were press gathered around you and interviewing you did you have some comments to give other people?
[05:49:48.220 --> 05:49:58.220]  Oh absolutely I showed them the photographs and the notice right when I presented the photographs notice how the clown in the back of me put up his clipboard to block my photographs from the cameras
[05:49:59.220 --> 05:49:59.220]  Really?
[05:50:00.220 --> 05:50:06.220]  And they didn't want these photos to be shown they shut the entire press conference down because I revealed I exposed the truth and what's going on
[05:50:07.220 --> 05:50:11.220]  Okay Dan can you think of anybody in particular did you notice any particular affiliate or anybody that you talked to
[05:50:11.220 --> 05:50:19.220]  Devastating victory devastating everybody should join in with the next press conference all real media converge on Boston defeat the terrorist
[05:50:20.220 --> 05:50:28.220]  Alright Alex so Dan did you notice anybody in particular that you gave an interview to any affiliate any local person?
[05:50:29.220 --> 05:50:31.220]  I'm sorry repeat that question
[05:50:32.220 --> 05:50:36.220]  Can you think of anybody in particular did you talk to CNN did you talk to Fox was there anybody in particular you talked to
[05:50:36.220 --> 05:50:45.220]  I did that talk to everybody I mean I just brought in cameras and reporters though I mean I think the old hero just wouldn't say what kind to say
[05:50:46.220 --> 05:50:55.220]  Okay so if you're out there and you're an info warrior especially if you're in the city of Boston watch your local news see if you can find those Dan Badandi clips and send them to us at showtips at info wars
[05:50:56.220 --> 05:51:02.220]  And also I believe there's a we have a couple other ones but you can call in and call us and tell us about it 877-789 Alex
[05:51:02.220 --> 05:51:16.220]  Hey Dan it was a Dan it's a little bit hard to hear you I just wanted to clarify this so you're saying that you had pictures printed out that we had and you were holding those up and they put clipboards up to cover that is that what you're saying
[05:51:17.220 --> 05:51:21.220]  Absolutely there are 8 by 10 glassy photos you get the photos from CNN.com
[05:51:22.220 --> 05:51:25.220]  We presented them and of course you know they called the press conference
[05:51:25.220 --> 05:51:33.220]  Dan let me just stop you and repeat all this slowly because I understand you're under cell it's over driving they don't want the white redneck patsies they probably already executed out there
[05:51:34.220 --> 05:51:44.220]  They don't want these Navy SEALs they are scared I'm telling you folks you get these articles out that are at info wars.com this is coffin nails to the tyranny go ahead Dan
[05:51:44.220 --> 05:51:55.220]  If you notice on the tv Alex when I was doing this the looks on these criminal stations they jumped off that stage like oh my god we just got exposed to the world
[05:51:56.220 --> 05:51:57.220]  Yeah that's exactly what they looked like
[05:51:58.220 --> 05:52:03.220]  We at info wars.com we just nailed right through the heart of the new world order this week one day today man
[05:52:04.220 --> 05:52:08.220]  That's all your work you've been doing Alex day and night you drove a stick through the heart of the new world order
[05:52:08.220 --> 05:52:17.220]  Alright Dan that's some good reporting we're having a little bit of a difficulty hearing you so maybe we can get back in touch with you at a later date but definitely get us that footage
[05:52:18.220 --> 05:52:19.220]  Alright let me get some better reception here
[05:52:20.220 --> 05:52:21.220]  Oh Dan
[05:52:22.220 --> 05:52:24.220]  Alright I'll probably reach back I got better reception over here
[05:52:25.220 --> 05:52:27.220]  Okay he said he has better reception I think Alex is trying to talk to you
[05:52:28.220 --> 05:52:29.220]  I'm on air now?
[05:52:30.220 --> 05:52:31.220]  I can hear you Alex
[05:52:32.220 --> 05:52:36.220]  Yeah I'm in here in the studio so listen this is so exciting folks we're actually engaging people Dan are you using hands free?
[05:52:36.220 --> 05:52:40.220]  What did he say?
[05:52:41.220 --> 05:52:42.220]  Don't sound like somebody is talking to him
[05:52:43.220 --> 05:52:44.220]  Dan
[05:52:45.220 --> 05:52:46.220]  Badandi are you on hands free?
[05:52:47.220 --> 05:52:48.220]  Hello Dan
[05:52:49.220 --> 05:52:50.220]  I don't think he can hear me I don't think it's pipe through
[05:52:51.220 --> 05:52:52.220]  No he can't hear me either
[05:52:53.220 --> 05:52:54.220]  Just tell him to get off hands free
[05:52:55.220 --> 05:52:57.220]  I can't hear him Alex can we just call him back can we hang up and call him back
[05:52:58.220 --> 05:52:59.220]  He's just
[05:53:00.220 --> 05:53:02.220]  It sounded like somebody said something to him I wonder if somebody cut him off
[05:53:02.220 --> 05:53:06.220]  Yeah alright so can we just call him back and we'll try to reestablish a connection there with Dan Badandi
[05:53:07.220 --> 05:53:10.220]  No cut the fact that this is a devastating victory let me tell you dude they are scared
[05:53:11.220 --> 05:53:14.220]  He said the police were like going you're going to be a good boy now aren't you
[05:53:15.220 --> 05:53:17.220]  They didn't want to make a scene about arresting him but then point everybody at this
[05:53:18.220 --> 05:53:24.220]  They're like please don't look at other photos we blew the kids up please we murdered people please don't look at it
[05:53:25.220 --> 05:53:26.220]  I mean this is amazing
[05:53:27.220 --> 05:53:30.220]  When you got the government saying please don't look here where do you look?
[05:53:30.220 --> 05:53:31.220]  Right right back there
[05:53:32.220 --> 05:53:35.220]  There's nobody buried in the backyard don't dig under the rose bushes
[05:53:36.220 --> 05:53:37.220]  Pay no attention to the man behind the curtain
[05:53:38.220 --> 05:53:41.220]  Exactly alright so we're trying to reestablish connection with Dan Badandi
[05:53:42.220 --> 05:53:44.220]  In the meantime Adam in Florida continue your point
[05:53:45.220 --> 05:53:53.220]  To again bring up a couple points Alex just touched on one of them but really what I want to get out
[05:53:54.220 --> 05:53:58.220]  And again with the Napolitano don't look at anything but what I give you
[05:53:58.220 --> 05:54:01.220]  Make sure it's filtered before you report on it
[05:54:02.220 --> 05:54:07.220]  I mean anybody that knows anything about sociology I'm not a sociology major by any means
[05:54:08.220 --> 05:54:11.220]  But at the same time I study people that's one of my head hobbies
[05:54:12.220 --> 05:54:16.220]  Anybody that plays poker you know I mean you can just look at these people and tell
[05:54:17.220 --> 05:54:21.220]  Their minds are going a mile a minute on how to keep everything down
[05:54:22.220 --> 05:54:24.220]  They don't want any of this information leaking out
[05:54:24.220 --> 05:54:27.220]  And again I can't congratulate you guys on what you're doing enough
[05:54:28.220 --> 05:54:30.220]  Well thank you they don't want the public to question it
[05:54:31.220 --> 05:54:33.220]  And they don't want a congressman to question this either
[05:54:34.220 --> 05:54:36.220]  Thanks for your call we have to keep moving thank you for your call
[05:54:37.220 --> 05:54:39.220]  We'll move on now to Marcus in Texas
[05:54:40.220 --> 05:54:45.220]  Just you know sitting here listening to what's been going on
[05:54:46.220 --> 05:54:51.220]  Originally my opinion was that not everything is a false flag
[05:54:51.220 --> 05:54:55.220]  Maybe this one was real but just listening in the last few minutes
[05:54:56.220 --> 05:54:58.220]  This is really starting to look real to me
[05:54:59.220 --> 05:55:02.220]  I'm a doubter because I'm a little bit cautious
[05:55:03.220 --> 05:55:05.220]  And I guess there's probably nothing wrong with that
[05:55:06.220 --> 05:55:10.220]  My main reason to call in was to try to inject a little bit of humor
[05:55:11.220 --> 05:55:15.220]  And make a comment about the gun reform defeat
[05:55:15.220 --> 05:55:20.220]  And I'm looking at Yahoo News and it says
[05:55:21.220 --> 05:55:25.220]  Obama chastises the Senate over failed gun reform amendment
[05:55:26.220 --> 05:55:29.220]  If you scroll down to the near the bottom of the page
[05:55:30.220 --> 05:55:32.220]  Just a second let me
[05:55:33.220 --> 05:55:38.220]  There's another subtitle explore related content
[05:55:39.220 --> 05:55:43.220]  And if you look you see in the center you see Obama and Joe Biden
[05:55:43.220 --> 05:55:46.220]  Standing right beside him and no kidding
[05:55:47.220 --> 05:55:52.220]  I swear one of Jeff Dunham's puppets is missing
[05:55:53.220 --> 05:55:56.220]  He looks exactly like Walter
[05:55:57.220 --> 05:55:59.220]  Okay thank you for your call we're almost to the end of our broadcast
[05:56:00.220 --> 05:56:01.220]  So we're going to jump thank you for your call Marcus
[05:56:02.220 --> 05:56:04.220]  We'll move on to Rob in Indiana
[05:56:05.220 --> 05:56:08.220]  Okay I'm sorry Rob hang right there we have Dan Badani back
[05:56:09.220 --> 05:56:10.220]  Dan go ahead
[05:56:10.220 --> 05:56:14.220]  Hello Dan can you hear me I can't hear him
[05:56:15.220 --> 05:56:16.220]  Hey Dan are you there?
[05:56:17.220 --> 05:56:18.220]  Yeah
[05:56:19.220 --> 05:56:20.220]  You're on the wrong line
[05:56:21.220 --> 05:56:23.220]  I'm sorry this is Dan's wife?
[05:56:26.220 --> 05:56:27.220]  Oh okay
[05:56:28.220 --> 05:56:29.220]  Does he want to talk to us?
[05:56:30.220 --> 05:56:33.220]  Yeah I can hear the ringtone
[05:56:34.220 --> 05:56:36.220]  I can hear the ringtone in my piece thank you guys
[05:56:36.220 --> 05:56:39.220]  Just let us know when you get Dan back is he ready to go?
[05:56:41.220 --> 05:56:43.220]  Okay they're still trying to get him back
[05:56:44.220 --> 05:56:45.220]  Okay Rob in Indiana I'm sorry go ahead
[05:56:47.220 --> 05:56:48.220]  Rob?
[05:56:49.220 --> 05:56:53.220]  I'd like to first of all say thank you for all the information you guys put out
[05:56:54.220 --> 05:56:59.220]  I mean honestly a lot of people are so uninformed of what's going on
[05:57:00.220 --> 05:57:03.220]  And a lot of it's crazy it's so crazy you can't even believe it
[05:57:03.220 --> 05:57:05.220]  And that's half of my problem I try to talk to people
[05:57:06.220 --> 05:57:11.220]  But the reason I'm calling is there's actually more similarities in the way these guys are dressed
[05:57:12.220 --> 05:57:13.220]  Than you would think
[05:57:14.220 --> 05:57:15.220]  I've looked at the pictures
[05:57:16.220 --> 05:57:19.220]  Okay I'm sorry can you get to the chase we're going on time
[05:57:20.220 --> 05:57:21.220]  Yeah yeah yeah yeah okay
[05:57:22.220 --> 05:57:25.220]  When you look at the pictures of the potential seal gentlemen
[05:57:26.220 --> 05:57:29.220]  They have khaki pants they're wearing black jackets
[05:57:29.220 --> 05:57:32.220]  And one's actually wearing a black hat with a white mark on it
[05:57:33.220 --> 05:57:36.220]  Now doesn't it seem obvious when you're trying to create a deception
[05:57:37.220 --> 05:57:40.220]  That you would have more than one person dressed alike
[05:57:41.220 --> 05:57:43.220]  Just so you can't pin it on anybody
[05:57:44.220 --> 05:57:45.220]  Okay I'm sorry Rob we had to put you back on hold
[05:57:46.220 --> 05:57:48.220]  We have Dan Badandi back on the scene Dan can you hear me?
[05:57:49.220 --> 05:57:50.220]  Yeah I can hear you
[05:57:51.220 --> 05:57:53.220]  Okay so it sounded like somebody was talking to you when we lost contact?
[05:57:54.220 --> 05:57:56.220]  Yeah we were still getting bombarded by the press out here
[05:57:56.220 --> 05:57:58.220]  I'm in my car right now
[05:57:59.220 --> 05:58:01.220]  I got my buddies out here showing the photographs
[05:58:02.220 --> 05:58:04.220]  It was like amazing again
[05:58:05.220 --> 05:58:07.220]  They quickly avoided the question
[05:58:08.220 --> 05:58:11.220]  The thing is if these things went through why would they dress and say hey we got proof it's not
[05:58:12.220 --> 05:58:16.220]  If they choose to avoid it and give you dirty looks then they cancel the press conference
[05:58:17.220 --> 05:58:18.220]  If a woman comes on stage it's over
[05:58:19.220 --> 05:58:21.220]  It was like a couple minutes into the question and not even
[05:58:22.220 --> 05:58:23.220]  They refused to answer my questions
[05:58:23.220 --> 05:58:28.220]  Now did you see I didn't see on the stage was the governor or the mayor or anybody else you talked to there?
[05:58:29.220 --> 05:58:34.220]  I didn't see the governor but the FBI director he was here he was actually charged anyway
[05:58:35.220 --> 05:58:37.220]  There was a bunch of friends that were here
[05:58:38.220 --> 05:58:39.220]  All the friends were here
[05:58:40.220 --> 05:58:41.220]  Leaders whoever they are
[05:58:42.220 --> 05:58:46.220]  And Dan they don't put all those people on the podium just to have them stand there
[05:58:47.220 --> 05:58:48.220]  They're going to let some of those other people speak as well
[05:58:49.220 --> 05:58:50.220]  That was the original plan so you did shut that press conference down
[05:58:50.220 --> 05:58:52.220]  Yeah because he said oh here's Alex
[05:58:53.220 --> 05:58:57.220]  Dan you have shut down all three press conferences now you've got to call Luke Rudowski we should link up with him
[05:58:58.220 --> 05:59:00.220]  And like have 15 people in there next time
[05:59:01.220 --> 05:59:02.220]  Because they're going to try to drag you out it doesn't matter
[05:59:03.220 --> 05:59:04.220]  It just shows how it's one man
[05:59:05.220 --> 05:59:07.220]  These people these crooks just run everything and no one resists them
[05:59:08.220 --> 05:59:09.220]  One man Dan Badundi
[05:59:10.220 --> 05:59:11.220]  One man Dan Badundi
[05:59:12.220 --> 05:59:15.220]  I mean it's just like we're on them like stink on you know what
[05:59:15.220 --> 05:59:19.220]  And it is on man I mean well done Lord Vader
[05:59:20.220 --> 05:59:21.220]  Excellent excellent
[05:59:22.220 --> 05:59:23.220]  So you said
[05:59:24.220 --> 05:59:26.220]  Oh yeah this is going to be good
[05:59:27.220 --> 05:59:29.220]  Man well battling the enemy hard
[05:59:30.220 --> 05:59:32.220]  That's what it needs to be that guy called earlier and wanted to know how to get on there
[05:59:33.220 --> 05:59:34.220]  Go to Boston right now if you're listening
[05:59:35.220 --> 05:59:41.220]  Yes if you get out of your basement get away from your computer and go to Boston and start getting in the face of people and starting to ask people questions
[05:59:41.220 --> 05:59:46.220]  By the way Infowars is getting double the traffic it's ever gotten
[05:59:47.220 --> 05:59:49.220]  We broke the record a few days ago now it's double that
[05:59:50.220 --> 05:59:52.220]  Right now smoke is coming out of it
[05:59:53.220 --> 05:59:54.220]  The server is in fire
[05:59:55.220 --> 05:59:59.220]  And Watson just went up with the deal of FBI ignores men with backpacks
[06:00:00.220 --> 06:00:01.220]  But that's not even the issue
[06:00:02.220 --> 06:00:04.220]  That's a great headline by Watson working around the clock it's like midnight where he's at
[06:00:05.220 --> 06:00:06.220]  It's even worse than that
[06:00:07.220 --> 06:00:09.220]  This is the FBI saying never mind all the real suspects
[06:00:09.220 --> 06:00:11.220]  Because it's their people we have them
[06:00:12.220 --> 06:00:13.220]  That is them panicking
[06:00:14.220 --> 06:00:18.220]  And please media don't look at Infowars or Trudge whatever you do
[06:00:19.220 --> 06:00:21.220]  Yeah it's like you tell the kids don't do that then they go and do it
[06:00:22.220 --> 06:00:26.220]  But I mean if it was BS they would just say whatever this is what we think no it's like don't look there
[06:00:27.220 --> 06:00:31.220]  And they're begging the media play all of us now we'll pat you on the head
[06:00:32.220 --> 06:00:33.220]  That's right
[06:00:34.220 --> 06:00:37.220]  Go for five more minutes with Badani take a break and restart recordings
[06:00:37.220 --> 06:00:40.220]  You know just when we're live it's filling up the data thing
[06:00:41.220 --> 06:00:43.220]  And if you guys can come back on if you want if the crew wants you can have a vote on it
[06:00:44.220 --> 06:00:46.220]  If not seven o'clock central info is nightly news
[06:00:47.220 --> 06:00:50.220]  Okay alright Dan we're going to wrap up with you then we'll try to give maybe Rob one minute
[06:00:51.220 --> 06:00:52.220]  Five minutes he can have whatever he wants
[06:00:53.220 --> 06:00:56.220]  Okay alright Dan just let's start from the beginning just tell us your whole story and your words
[06:00:57.220 --> 06:01:00.220]  First of all the hotel is the Sheraton on Dalton Street in Boston
[06:01:01.220 --> 06:01:02.220]  It's right next to the Hilton you can't miss it
[06:01:02.220 --> 06:01:09.220]  Again I think it's 40 or whatever it's the Hilton right next to the Hilton is called the Sheraton Hotel on Dalton Street in Boston
[06:01:10.220 --> 06:01:13.220]  And if you're wanting to get out here ask questions we need you
[06:01:14.220 --> 06:01:16.220]  We're still at the hotel now we're outside the grounds here
[06:01:17.220 --> 06:01:20.220]  And you know we're just like informing people as they're walking showing them the pictures
[06:01:21.220 --> 06:01:26.220]  We have the videos rolling and if you want to start over we ask the questions
[06:01:27.220 --> 06:01:29.220]  And they got ignored so I kept pushing the questions
[06:01:29.220 --> 06:01:33.220]  They quickly jumped on stage the seven women canceled the press conference
[06:01:34.220 --> 06:01:37.220]  All the men flew off the stage with their tails between their legs because they knew they were lags
[06:01:38.220 --> 06:01:39.220]  And if you notice right
[06:01:40.220 --> 06:01:42.220]  I'll state this in case you didn't hear me earlier
[06:01:43.220 --> 06:01:45.220]  When the photos were given to me because my friend arrived late
[06:01:46.220 --> 06:01:50.220]  The FBI agent scared at us okay I heard the FBI agent in the hall he said they got photographs
[06:01:51.220 --> 06:01:52.220]  Because we were being watched the whole time
[06:01:53.220 --> 06:01:55.220]  That's why when he first came out he right away he stated
[06:01:55.220 --> 06:02:01.220]  Don't ignore photographs except for our FBI photographs on the website
[06:02:02.220 --> 06:02:05.220]  Really? Yeah beware Dan is armed with photographs
[06:02:06.220 --> 06:02:08.220]  I know this man has photographic evidence
[06:02:09.220 --> 06:02:10.220]  He is in the info war
[06:02:11.220 --> 06:02:15.220]  One of the main issues going on is high upstaging for all we know
[06:02:16.220 --> 06:02:19.220]  He's putting a clipboard in my way so the cameras couldn't see my photographs
[06:02:20.220 --> 06:02:22.220]  You said it was a reporter who put a clipboard in your way?
[06:02:22.220 --> 06:02:25.220]  Yeah I don't know if he's a reporter or some agent or whatever
[06:02:26.220 --> 06:02:28.220]  If we are a government agent or reporter or whatever
[06:02:29.220 --> 06:02:32.220]  He's trying to block my pictures with the clipboard from all the cameras
[06:02:33.220 --> 06:02:34.220]  He can succeed with that of course
[06:02:35.220 --> 06:02:36.220]  Yeah okay
[06:02:37.220 --> 06:02:38.220]  Alright so Dan
[06:02:39.220 --> 06:02:42.220]  No you sound good I just want to hear your whole story from the beginning and the time we have
[06:02:43.220 --> 06:02:45.220]  So the press conference begins and just tell us your view
[06:02:46.220 --> 06:02:49.220]  Well the press conference begins again right away they have a stake
[06:02:49.220 --> 06:02:52.220]  Don't pay attention to any other photos except for ours
[06:02:53.220 --> 06:02:55.220]  Because God forbid you like to look for truth
[06:02:56.220 --> 06:02:58.220]  Because they had seen the photos we had
[06:02:59.220 --> 06:03:01.220]  Probably seen a stack of photos
[06:03:02.220 --> 06:03:06.220]  We're the FBI whatever you do don't look at these other photos of our people with the bombs
[06:03:07.220 --> 06:03:10.220]  Yep and we got bombarded by the press
[06:03:11.220 --> 06:03:13.220]  I think it was foreign media there that were actually questioning
[06:03:14.220 --> 06:03:17.220]  Taking video photos of our photos and wanted to hear everything we had to say
[06:03:17.220 --> 06:03:19.220]  And they were very interested in that
[06:03:20.220 --> 06:03:22.220]  Because then like dumbed down mainstream media
[06:03:23.220 --> 06:03:25.220]  Foreigners love this stuff and they like to hear the truth
[06:03:26.220 --> 06:03:28.220]  And of course there are a lot of info on the worldwide audience
[06:03:29.220 --> 06:03:30.220]  And that's why we're number one in the world
[06:03:31.220 --> 06:03:34.220]  Because we got a bunch of great people out there who search for the truth
[06:03:35.220 --> 06:03:38.220]  And it's amazing we just suck a punch
[06:03:39.220 --> 06:03:41.220]  We blasted the new world order right in the heart
[06:03:42.220 --> 06:03:44.220]  Well they have a lot of influence on the mainstream media
[06:03:44.220 --> 06:03:46.220]  Because the mainstream media wants access to them
[06:03:47.220 --> 06:03:48.220]  They want to be called on when it's time to ask questions
[06:03:49.220 --> 06:03:50.220]  So they're going to play nice
[06:03:51.220 --> 06:03:52.220]  They're going to do whatever the FBI and the government tells them to do
[06:03:53.220 --> 06:03:56.220]  And that's why the foreign press is interested in digging into this
[06:03:57.220 --> 06:03:58.220]  And finding out what the truth is
[06:03:59.220 --> 06:04:00.220]  And that's why we're interested
[06:04:01.220 --> 06:04:03.220]  We're more interested in the truth than we are about position
[06:04:04.220 --> 06:04:06.220]  By the way Dan you getting Infowars.com out on every network
[06:04:07.220 --> 06:04:09.220]  I said double the traffic that was earlier the report
[06:04:10.220 --> 06:04:11.220]  It's like 50 times the traffic
[06:04:11.220 --> 06:04:15.220]  We're getting a million visitors every couple minutes right now
[06:04:16.220 --> 06:04:17.220]  Are you serious?
[06:04:18.220 --> 06:04:20.220]  No no no it's 100,000k new people every 60 seconds
[06:04:21.220 --> 06:04:22.220]  Wow
[06:04:23.220 --> 06:04:24.220]  This is probably like the number one website in the world
[06:04:25.220 --> 06:04:26.220]  Just during this window
[06:04:27.220 --> 06:04:31.220]  It is 100,000k new joining who's already on it
[06:04:32.220 --> 06:04:34.220]  This isn't hits these are visitors every minute
[06:04:35.220 --> 06:04:36.220]  Wow
[06:04:37.220 --> 06:04:38.220]  We're watching the new world order burn down
[06:04:38.220 --> 06:04:42.220]  Of course enemy starters choices are on their way
[06:04:43.220 --> 06:04:44.220]  New American
[06:04:45.220 --> 06:04:46.220]  One of the groups we have
[06:04:47.220 --> 06:04:49.220]  We have a group here that joined me
[06:04:50.220 --> 06:04:51.220]  And he was one of my camera guys
[06:04:52.220 --> 06:04:53.220]  Let me see if that's yours
[06:04:54.220 --> 06:04:56.220]  It's called the free American Patriots Movement
[06:04:57.220 --> 06:04:59.220]  And his name is Nick Marshall
[06:05:00.220 --> 06:05:01.220]  Nick Marshall I should say
[06:05:02.220 --> 06:05:03.220]  He was one of my camera guys
[06:05:04.220 --> 06:05:05.220]  And he braised right through the storm
[06:05:05.220 --> 06:05:07.220]  And I mean my other buddy Kevin LaPlate
[06:05:08.220 --> 06:05:09.220]  Yeah I just want to give a shout out to them
[06:05:10.220 --> 06:05:11.220]  Because they covered my butt right now
[06:05:12.220 --> 06:05:13.220]  They got little cameras all over me the whole time
[06:05:14.220 --> 06:05:15.220]  And we were filming an event
[06:05:16.220 --> 06:05:17.220]  Great
[06:05:18.220 --> 06:05:19.220]  What's your point about that thing?
[06:05:20.220 --> 06:05:21.220]  Is that your friend?
[06:05:22.220 --> 06:05:23.220]  Before the event started
[06:05:24.220 --> 06:05:25.220]  Officials came and said
[06:05:26.220 --> 06:05:27.220]  We need to clear the room
[06:05:28.220 --> 06:05:29.220]  We need to bag some belongings in the room
[06:05:30.220 --> 06:05:31.220]  They're going to do a search of the room
[06:05:32.220 --> 06:05:33.220]  So I had my camera crew
[06:05:33.220 --> 06:05:35.220]  We do our cheers every which way the cameras are set up
[06:05:36.220 --> 06:05:37.220]  This way because we know
[06:05:38.220 --> 06:05:39.220]  Just in case it doesn't play enough of an honor
[06:05:40.220 --> 06:05:41.220]  So we covered our butt
[06:05:42.220 --> 06:05:43.220]  And one of the military was trying to tell the odd guy
[06:05:44.220 --> 06:05:45.220]  He used to shut the cameras off
[06:05:46.220 --> 06:05:47.220]  And of course we did
[06:05:48.220 --> 06:05:49.220]  And I asked him are you the army guy?
[06:05:50.220 --> 06:05:51.220]  I said are you doing a security check?
[06:05:52.220 --> 06:05:53.220]  He said yes I am
[06:05:54.220 --> 06:05:55.220]  And I asked him are you a posse comitatus?
[06:05:56.220 --> 06:05:57.220]  He said no I didn't
[06:05:58.220 --> 06:05:59.220]  About a year in the military you should know the constitution
[06:06:00.220 --> 06:06:01.220]  He's never heard of posse comitatus
[06:06:01.220 --> 06:06:02.220]  Yeah we
[06:06:03.220 --> 06:06:04.220]  I experienced that when I went out to the Formula 1 racetrack
[06:06:05.220 --> 06:06:06.220]  Okay Dan we're not going to wear you out
[06:06:07.220 --> 06:06:08.220]  I'm pretty sure they want you for the info wars nightly news
[06:06:09.220 --> 06:06:10.220]  Absolutely
[06:06:11.220 --> 06:06:13.220]  So maybe if you can get close to a Skype or something like that
[06:06:14.220 --> 06:06:15.220]  And you can talk to Alex a little bit later on
[06:06:16.220 --> 06:06:18.220]  But that's Dan Badandi on the scene in Boston
[06:06:19.220 --> 06:06:20.220]  And one more thing before you go
[06:06:21.220 --> 06:06:22.220]  I just want to state
[06:06:23.220 --> 06:06:24.220]  I read some articles lately
[06:06:25.220 --> 06:06:26.220]  And there's articles stating forever
[06:06:27.220 --> 06:06:29.220]  No matter what mainstream media could never again ignore false flags
[06:06:29.220 --> 06:06:33.220]  And they also could never again rule out a government as a possible suspect
[06:06:34.220 --> 06:06:37.220]  We have dented this into the minds and hearts of American people
[06:06:38.220 --> 06:06:39.220]  And the truth again
[06:06:40.220 --> 06:06:41.220]  The truth will never be held back
[06:06:42.220 --> 06:06:43.220]  The truth will always be revealed
[06:06:44.220 --> 06:06:44.220]  Great job Dan
[06:06:45.220 --> 06:06:46.220]  And if we can stop that technique of false flags
[06:06:47.220 --> 06:06:48.220]  You've saved a lot of lives
[06:06:49.220 --> 06:06:50.220]  Thank you
[06:06:51.220 --> 06:06:52.220]  And you know thanks to all you guys for getting these pictures out
[06:06:53.220 --> 06:06:54.220]  And you know we're all a team here
[06:06:55.220 --> 06:06:56.220]  It's all you know
[06:06:56.220 --> 06:06:58.220]  The criticals to every one of us especially Alex
[06:06:59.220 --> 06:07:00.220]  Who's working in the sleep right here
[06:07:01.220 --> 06:07:04.220]  And Alex is amazing
[06:07:05.220 --> 06:07:06.220]  So my hats off to you all you guys
[06:07:07.220 --> 06:07:08.220]  Great job Dan
[06:07:09.220 --> 06:07:10.220]  Alright Dan we'll talk to you soon
[06:07:11.220 --> 06:07:12.220]  God bless you
[06:07:13.220 --> 06:07:14.220]  Alright there goes Dan Badandi
[06:07:15.220 --> 06:07:16.220]  Let's go ahead and finish up with Rob in Indiana
[06:07:17.220 --> 06:07:18.220]  Sorry for the long wait
[06:07:19.220 --> 06:07:20.220]  But go ahead with your point Rob
[06:07:21.220 --> 06:07:22.220]  Hey that was awesome actually how about that
[06:07:23.220 --> 06:07:24.220]  Actually I would like to say one thing
[06:07:24.220 --> 06:07:25.220]  If you can hear me I'd like to tell you thank you
[06:07:26.220 --> 06:07:28.220]  For all the information that you're putting out
[06:07:29.220 --> 06:07:31.220]  It really does make a difference
[06:07:32.220 --> 06:07:33.220]  So if that means anything to you
[06:07:34.220 --> 06:07:35.220]  That's just a true honest thank you
[06:07:36.220 --> 06:07:37.220]  The other thing is
[06:07:38.220 --> 06:07:39.220]  I'll get back to my point
[06:07:40.220 --> 06:07:41.220]  When I make this really quick and I'll be on
[06:07:42.220 --> 06:07:44.220]  Is there is a lot of similarities between
[06:07:45.220 --> 06:07:46.220]  What those two gentlemen were wearing
[06:07:47.220 --> 06:07:48.220]  They both had khaki pants
[06:07:49.220 --> 06:07:50.220]  They both had black jackets
[06:07:51.220 --> 06:07:52.220]  One had a black hat with a white emblem on it
[06:07:52.220 --> 06:07:54.220]  The other one had a black hat with a white emblem on it
[06:07:55.220 --> 06:07:56.220]  They both carried backpacks
[06:07:57.220 --> 06:07:58.220]  I don't know
[06:07:59.220 --> 06:08:00.220]  Maybe I'm wrong
[06:08:01.220 --> 06:08:02.220]  Maybe I'm overseeing too much in this
[06:08:03.220 --> 06:08:05.220]  But it sure sounds like that this is
[06:08:06.220 --> 06:08:07.220]  They're trying to create a diversion
[06:08:08.220 --> 06:08:09.220]  That's all
[06:08:10.220 --> 06:08:11.220]  And then I'll finish up with this
[06:08:12.220 --> 06:08:13.220]  I'll say it's a dang shame
[06:08:14.220 --> 06:08:16.220]  That we've become what we fought to get away from
[06:08:17.220 --> 06:08:18.220]  That's all I got to say
[06:08:19.220 --> 06:08:20.220]  That is always the challenge
[06:08:20.220 --> 06:08:22.220]  That you don't become the monsters that you fight
[06:08:23.220 --> 06:08:24.220]  Exactly
[06:08:25.220 --> 06:08:26.220]  Alright guys
[06:08:27.220 --> 06:08:28.220]  I know we wanted to call it at five
[06:08:29.220 --> 06:08:30.220]  But Alex says we are now the number one
[06:08:31.220 --> 06:08:32.220]  News site in the world or close to it
[06:08:33.220 --> 06:08:34.220]  Can we do 5.30?
[06:08:35.220 --> 06:08:36.220]  I don't want to go all the way to seven
[06:08:37.220 --> 06:08:38.220]  But can we do 5.30?
[06:08:39.220 --> 06:08:40.220]  We'll go to 5.30
[06:08:41.220 --> 06:08:42.220]  We'll go continue with the calls
[06:08:43.220 --> 06:08:44.220]  Diane in Louisiana
[06:08:45.220 --> 06:08:46.220]  You are on the air
[06:08:47.220 --> 06:08:48.220]  Hi David
[06:08:48.220 --> 06:08:49.220]  There was a caller earlier
[06:08:50.220 --> 06:08:51.220]  Who mentioned he was from Louisiana
[06:08:52.220 --> 06:08:53.220]  And was talking about the black helicopters
[06:08:54.220 --> 06:08:55.220]  Yes
[06:08:56.220 --> 06:08:57.220]  Well the night Alex Jones was on Coast to Coast
[06:08:58.220 --> 06:08:59.220]  I pulled up an article
[06:09:00.220 --> 06:09:01.220]  Ran by accident
[06:09:02.220 --> 06:09:03.220]  They are having drills
[06:09:04.220 --> 06:09:05.220]  They are scheduled for New Orleans
[06:09:06.220 --> 06:09:07.220]  They didn't give a date
[06:09:08.220 --> 06:09:10.220]  But they are letting the residents know
[06:09:11.220 --> 06:09:13.220]  That there will be some drills in New Orleans
[06:09:14.220 --> 06:09:15.220]  So I'm thinking
[06:09:15.220 --> 06:09:17.220]  For Alex to get in touch with his friend Charles
[06:09:18.220 --> 06:09:20.220]  Now do you know anything specific about the drills?
[06:09:21.220 --> 06:09:22.220]  No I don't
[06:09:23.220 --> 06:09:29.220]  But you can pick it up at www.wrno.com
[06:09:30.220 --> 06:09:31.220]  WRNO?
[06:09:32.220 --> 06:09:33.220]  We can look that up right now guys?
[06:09:34.220 --> 06:09:35.220]  Local TV or radio station
[06:09:36.220 --> 06:09:37.220]  Right it's for the local news
[06:09:38.220 --> 06:09:39.220]  And it was headline
[06:09:40.220 --> 06:09:41.220]  They didn't go into a whole lot of details
[06:09:42.220 --> 06:09:43.220]  But they was letting the residents know
[06:09:43.220 --> 06:09:44.220]  That they will be doing drills in New Orleans
[06:09:45.220 --> 06:09:46.220]  But they did not give a date as to when
[06:09:47.220 --> 06:09:48.220]  Okay
[06:09:49.220 --> 06:09:50.220]  Well hopefully they won't be going door to door
[06:09:51.220 --> 06:09:52.220]  That's probably why he's in the black helicopters
[06:09:53.220 --> 06:09:54.220]  Yeah I'm with David
[06:09:55.220 --> 06:09:56.220]  I hope they don't go door to door
[06:09:57.220 --> 06:09:58.220]  Thank you for your call
[06:09:59.220 --> 06:10:00.220]  The number to call in is 877-789
[06:10:01.220 --> 06:10:04.220]  Alex that is 877-789-2539
[06:10:05.220 --> 06:10:06.220]  We're only going to 530 Central Time
[06:10:07.220 --> 06:10:08.220]  It's about 510 right now
[06:10:09.220 --> 06:10:10.220]  So we'll try to blaze through these calls
[06:10:10.220 --> 06:10:13.220]  Let's go to Steve in Florida
[06:10:14.220 --> 06:10:15.220]  Yeah hey good afternoon
[06:10:16.220 --> 06:10:17.220]  Couple things I want to cover real quick
[06:10:18.220 --> 06:10:19.220]  In relation to this so called news conference
[06:10:20.220 --> 06:10:21.220]  That I picked up on watching it
[06:10:22.220 --> 06:10:25.220]  First of all the appearance of the arrogance
[06:10:26.220 --> 06:10:27.220]  Of the FBI spokesman
[06:10:28.220 --> 06:10:29.220]  I mean he had it written all over his face
[06:10:30.220 --> 06:10:31.220]  And did you notice the Freudian flipped the tongue
[06:10:32.220 --> 06:10:33.220]  Where he was referring to the victims
[06:10:34.220 --> 06:10:35.220]  And talking about their investigation
[06:10:36.220 --> 06:10:37.220]  They have all they need
[06:10:37.220 --> 06:10:39.220]  They deserve nothing more
[06:10:40.220 --> 06:10:41.220]  And then he switched to I mean nothing less
[06:10:42.220 --> 06:10:43.220]  I believe that was done on purpose
[06:10:44.220 --> 06:10:45.220]  And I also wanted to say that
[06:10:46.220 --> 06:10:47.220]  You know to me this whole news conference
[06:10:48.220 --> 06:10:49.220]  Was about one thing
[06:10:50.220 --> 06:10:51.220]  It wasn't about them saying we're investigating
[06:10:52.220 --> 06:10:53.220]  This was a direct shot at Alex Jones
[06:10:54.220 --> 06:10:55.220]  At infowars.com
[06:10:56.220 --> 06:10:57.220]  Because you notice as soon as Badandi
[06:10:58.220 --> 06:10:59.220]  Mentioned infowars
[06:11:00.220 --> 06:11:01.220]  They immediately shut them down
[06:11:02.220 --> 06:11:03.220]  The thing about we're not going to have anybody
[06:11:04.220 --> 06:11:05.220]  Nobody should look at any other photos
[06:11:05.220 --> 06:11:06.220]  Why?
[06:11:07.220 --> 06:11:08.220]  Because yesterday everything else had out
[06:11:09.220 --> 06:11:10.220]  About the photos of the fields
[06:11:11.220 --> 06:11:12.220]  Etcetera
[06:11:13.220 --> 06:11:14.220]  I really believe that's the main reason
[06:11:15.220 --> 06:11:16.220]  They put this out
[06:11:17.220 --> 06:11:18.220]  And finally I just wanted to say
[06:11:19.220 --> 06:11:20.220]  You know what you guys have been doing
[06:11:21.220 --> 06:11:22.220]  There with Infowars
[06:11:23.220 --> 06:11:24.220]  I would relate that to carpet bombing
[06:11:25.220 --> 06:11:26.220]  In a war
[06:11:27.220 --> 06:11:28.220]  You've gone to Smart Bomb
[06:11:29.220 --> 06:11:30.220]  And here you've got precision hit
[06:11:31.220 --> 06:11:32.220]  By Dan the Bomb D
[06:11:32.220 --> 06:11:34.220]  And his Smart Bomb approach
[06:11:35.220 --> 06:11:36.220]  And I want to say that
[06:11:37.220 --> 06:11:38.220]  What we ought to do is title
[06:11:39.220 --> 06:11:40.220]  What the New World Order is doing
[06:11:41.220 --> 06:11:42.220]  In relation to what happened Monday
[06:11:43.220 --> 06:11:45.220]  The Obama Marathon
[06:11:46.220 --> 06:11:48.220]  The New World Order race for the curse
[06:11:49.220 --> 06:11:50.220]  Yes
[06:11:51.220 --> 06:11:52.220]  Not for the cure but for the curse
[06:11:53.220 --> 06:11:54.220]  Alright thank you for your call
[06:11:55.220 --> 06:11:56.220]  The phone lines are lighting up
[06:11:57.220 --> 06:11:58.220]  So let's move quick
[06:11:59.220 --> 06:12:00.220]  We have Jim in Georgia
[06:12:00.220 --> 06:12:01.220]  Yes sir
[06:12:02.220 --> 06:12:03.220]  Yes go ahead sir
[06:12:04.220 --> 06:12:05.220]  Much love to you guys
[06:12:06.220 --> 06:12:07.220]  Thank you so much for your work
[06:12:08.220 --> 06:12:09.220]  And I don't care if anybody wants to hear thank you or not
[06:12:10.220 --> 06:12:11.220]  I'm going to tell you
[06:12:12.220 --> 06:12:13.220]  All of you
[06:12:14.220 --> 06:12:15.220]  Thank you
[06:12:16.220 --> 06:12:17.220]  Alright thank you
[06:12:18.220 --> 06:12:19.220]  So I ran into Alex years ago
[06:12:20.220 --> 06:12:21.220]  About 6 years ago I finally got the courage
[06:12:22.220 --> 06:12:23.220]  To look into my questions
[06:12:24.220 --> 06:12:25.220]  About 9-11
[06:12:26.220 --> 06:12:27.220]  And I read across depleted uranium
[06:12:27.220 --> 06:12:29.220]  If people don't have the courage to look it up
[06:12:30.220 --> 06:12:31.220]  I mean I don't know what to say for them
[06:12:32.220 --> 06:12:33.220]  But anyhow
[06:12:34.220 --> 06:12:35.220]  The truth is
[06:12:36.220 --> 06:12:37.220]  The best news source I've ever gotten
[06:12:38.220 --> 06:12:39.220]  Is Infowars.com
[06:12:40.220 --> 06:12:41.220]  Well thank you
[06:12:42.220 --> 06:12:43.220]  Definitely hands down
[06:12:44.220 --> 06:12:45.220]  Now here's the thing
[06:12:46.220 --> 06:12:47.220]  The FBI
[06:12:48.220 --> 06:12:49.220]  Trying to take control of the narrative
[06:12:50.220 --> 06:12:51.220]  Look all you have to do is call them
[06:12:52.220 --> 06:12:53.220]  And yell at them
[06:12:54.220 --> 06:12:55.220]  Tell them what are you doing
[06:12:55.220 --> 06:12:56.220]  Trying to control the narrative
[06:12:57.220 --> 06:12:58.220]  And try to tell me
[06:12:59.220 --> 06:13:00.220]  That my eyes
[06:13:01.220 --> 06:13:02.220]  See I am the real homeland security
[06:13:03.220 --> 06:13:04.220]  So are you
[06:13:05.220 --> 06:13:06.220]  And so is everybody else out there
[06:13:07.220 --> 06:13:08.220]  They don't control anything
[06:13:09.220 --> 06:13:10.220]  And I'm so sick
[06:13:11.220 --> 06:13:12.220]  Of them trying to control the narrative
[06:13:13.220 --> 06:13:14.220]  This is bull crap
[06:13:15.220 --> 06:13:16.220]  We can solve this
[06:13:17.220 --> 06:13:18.220]  And not just the FBI and Napolitano saying
[06:13:19.220 --> 06:13:20.220]  We'll tell you what to believe
[06:13:21.220 --> 06:13:22.220]  We'll tell you when you have credible information
[06:13:22.220 --> 06:13:24.220]  And she's telling that to the Congressman
[06:13:25.220 --> 06:13:26.220]  What it reminds me of is what they do
[06:13:27.220 --> 06:13:28.220]  When there's a disaster
[06:13:29.220 --> 06:13:30.220]  And FEMA comes in and basically
[06:13:31.220 --> 06:13:32.220]  Creates this incredible bottleneck
[06:13:33.220 --> 06:13:34.220]  And shuts down all efforts to aid people
[06:13:35.220 --> 06:13:36.220]  Because they don't allow
[06:13:37.220 --> 06:13:38.220]  Any local help to happen
[06:13:39.220 --> 06:13:40.220]  And it's real interesting
[06:13:41.220 --> 06:13:42.220]  When I've seen disasters
[06:13:43.220 --> 06:13:44.220]  If it's large scale they bring in FEMA
[06:13:45.220 --> 06:13:46.220]  And it basically shuts everything down
[06:13:47.220 --> 06:13:48.220]  But a smaller scale disaster
[06:13:49.220 --> 06:13:50.220]  People chip in
[06:13:50.220 --> 06:13:51.220]  Local police will keep people away
[06:13:52.220 --> 06:13:53.220]  From down power lines
[06:13:54.220 --> 06:13:55.220]  And then churches and businesses
[06:13:56.220 --> 06:13:57.220]  Will distribute food and clothing
[06:13:58.220 --> 06:13:59.220]  To each other
[06:14:00.220 --> 06:14:01.220]  Things work when they don't get in the way
[06:14:02.220 --> 06:14:03.220]  They're trying to break the normal human instinct
[06:14:04.220 --> 06:14:05.220]  To work together
[06:14:06.220 --> 06:14:07.220]  That's why you turn in MSNBC
[06:14:08.220 --> 06:14:09.220]  It's all race, religion, fight with each other
[06:14:10.220 --> 06:14:11.220]  Because they're globalists
[06:14:12.220 --> 06:14:13.220]  Waging war on humans
[06:14:14.220 --> 06:14:15.220]  You can see it right there
[06:14:16.220 --> 06:14:17.220]  And again
[06:14:17.220 --> 06:14:19.220]  Because I'm going to be able to go on there and tape
[06:14:20.220 --> 06:14:21.220]  And also if you guys want to do the nightly news tonight and live
[06:14:22.220 --> 06:14:23.220]  I did the interview with a guy
[06:14:24.220 --> 06:14:25.220]  They took his guns up my temple
[06:14:26.220 --> 06:14:27.220]  And I was going to do some of the show live
[06:14:28.220 --> 06:14:29.220]  I'll be honest with you
[06:14:30.220 --> 06:14:31.220]  I finally got some sleep last night
[06:14:32.220 --> 06:14:33.220]  I'm a little bit tired
[06:14:34.220 --> 06:14:35.220]  This all just needs to keep getting covered
[06:14:36.220 --> 06:14:37.220]  This crew is about to fall over
[06:14:38.220 --> 06:14:39.220]  But I'm telling you
[06:14:40.220 --> 06:14:41.220]  We could just go over there
[06:14:42.220 --> 06:14:43.220]  And when we're ready punch up maybe at six
[06:14:44.220 --> 06:14:45.220]  And then play the clips of Badandi and all this
[06:14:45.220 --> 06:14:46.220]  Look at the evidence of their control over mainstream media
[06:14:47.220 --> 06:14:48.220]  That there's only Drudge
[06:14:49.220 --> 06:14:50.220]  And that's getting brought up in Congress now
[06:14:51.220 --> 06:14:52.220]  And there's us
[06:14:53.220 --> 06:14:54.220]  And no one else is even there to let go
[06:14:55.220 --> 06:14:56.220]  Who are all these other people with backpacks all around
[06:14:57.220 --> 06:14:58.220]  I was looking at Navy Seal photos
[06:14:59.220 --> 06:15:00.220]  I kept saying like 20 yards
[06:15:01.220 --> 06:15:02.220]  It's more like 15 feet from the bomb
[06:15:03.220 --> 06:15:04.220]  From the spot
[06:15:05.220 --> 06:15:06.220]  I mean they're right there
[06:15:07.220 --> 06:15:08.220]  And they're looking at where the guy's at
[06:15:09.220 --> 06:15:10.220]  I mean they did this
[06:15:11.220 --> 06:15:12.220]  And of course they don't want to be seen
[06:15:12.220 --> 06:15:14.220]  They want to kill that little eight year old kid
[06:15:15.220 --> 06:15:16.220]  And you know what you want to show me that kid
[06:15:17.220 --> 06:15:18.220]  Make me be emotional
[06:15:19.220 --> 06:15:20.220]  So I give my rights up to you when I am emotional
[06:15:21.220 --> 06:15:22.220]  You murderers
[06:15:23.220 --> 06:15:24.220]  They're all in on it man
[06:15:25.220 --> 06:15:26.220]  You watch this I say oh maybe they don't know
[06:15:27.220 --> 06:15:28.220]  No they're in on it
[06:15:29.220 --> 06:15:30.220]  They're all in on it
[06:15:31.220 --> 06:15:32.220]  A bunch of killers man
[06:15:33.220 --> 06:15:34.220]  And you know what
[06:15:35.220 --> 06:15:36.220]  There's still men left in the world you bastards
[06:15:37.220 --> 06:15:38.220]  What do you want to say to them
[06:15:39.220 --> 06:15:40.220]  They're watching right now
[06:15:40.220 --> 06:15:41.220]  What do you want to say to both of you
[06:15:42.220 --> 06:15:43.220]  I mean the people that killed those people
[06:15:44.220 --> 06:15:45.220]  It's none of them a few dead collateral damage
[06:15:46.220 --> 06:15:47.220]  You know we're not humans
[06:15:48.220 --> 06:15:49.220]  They're watching right now
[06:15:50.220 --> 06:15:51.220]  What you said is exactly right
[06:15:52.220 --> 06:15:53.220]  We need to be concerned about the loss of life
[06:15:54.220 --> 06:15:55.220]  And you know one of the things
[06:15:56.220 --> 06:15:57.220]  I think Dan getting in their face
[06:15:58.220 --> 06:15:59.220]  And getting this false flag stuff out there
[06:16:00.220 --> 06:16:01.220]  I believe that they have repeatedly
[06:16:02.220 --> 06:16:03.220]  And all of us here we've looked at 9-11
[06:16:04.220 --> 06:16:05.220]  And these other events
[06:16:06.220 --> 06:16:07.220]  We believe that they've repeatedly staged
[06:16:07.220 --> 06:16:09.220]  And we've got to stop that tactic from working
[06:16:10.220 --> 06:16:11.220]  And the way you do that is get the information out there
[06:16:12.220 --> 06:16:13.220]  And tell people what they're doing
[06:16:14.220 --> 06:16:15.220]  And people should get angry about this
[06:16:16.220 --> 06:16:17.220]  Because like Alex said
[06:16:18.220 --> 06:16:19.220]  We want to follow this trail to wherever the murderers are
[06:16:20.220 --> 06:16:21.220]  Exactly
[06:16:22.220 --> 06:16:23.220]  Because there are some horrible people out there
[06:16:24.220 --> 06:16:25.220]  And we need to find out who these people really are
[06:16:26.220 --> 06:16:27.220]  And it reminds me
[06:16:28.220 --> 06:16:29.220]  I've been talking about this lately
[06:16:30.220 --> 06:16:31.220]  When Alex did an interview with Billy Corgan
[06:16:32.220 --> 06:16:33.220]  Of Smashing Pumpkins
[06:16:34.220 --> 06:16:35.220]  Billy said Alex you guys are great at information
[06:16:35.220 --> 06:16:36.220]  And dates and numbers
[06:16:37.220 --> 06:16:38.220]  But the thing you don't really connect with people with
[06:16:39.220 --> 06:16:40.220]  Is an emotion
[06:16:41.220 --> 06:16:43.220]  And we talk about the moms demand action and all this
[06:16:44.220 --> 06:16:45.220]  And they're not going so much off in numbers
[06:16:46.220 --> 06:16:47.220]  They're going over emotion
[06:16:48.220 --> 06:16:50.220]  Where was I when I heard the Sandy Hook kids got killed
[06:16:51.220 --> 06:16:52.220]  I was driving to my grandma's house
[06:16:53.220 --> 06:16:54.220]  So I was making a sandwich for my husband
[06:16:55.220 --> 06:16:56.220]  Or whatever the case may be
[06:16:57.220 --> 06:16:58.220]  And they drive off of emotion
[06:16:59.220 --> 06:17:00.220]  And that's not a bad thing
[06:17:01.220 --> 06:17:02.220]  But I mean you have to have it focused in the right direction
[06:17:02.220 --> 06:17:04.220]  When I see not just the kids killed at Sandy Hook
[06:17:05.220 --> 06:17:09.220]  But when I see the people who died in this latest Boston bombing
[06:17:10.220 --> 06:17:12.220]  And we say the number is relatively small
[06:17:13.220 --> 06:17:14.220]  Which it is relatively small, three people
[06:17:15.220 --> 06:17:16.220]  But those were three people whose lives have been lost
[06:17:17.220 --> 06:17:18.220]  And people whose lives have been changed
[06:17:19.220 --> 06:17:20.220]  Because they've been injured
[06:17:21.220 --> 06:17:22.220]  Physically, emotionally, spiritually
[06:17:23.220 --> 06:17:24.220]  Go back to September 11th
[06:17:25.220 --> 06:17:27.220]  The event that they used to fundamentally alter society
[06:17:28.220 --> 06:17:29.220]  In our country
[06:17:29.220 --> 06:17:31.220]  And think about the fact that they shut down the crime scene
[06:17:32.220 --> 06:17:33.220]  That they shipped this evidence abroad
[06:17:34.220 --> 06:17:35.220]  As we mentioned earlier tonight
[06:17:36.220 --> 06:17:37.220]  That they obstructed justice
[06:17:38.220 --> 06:17:39.220]  That they have shut this down
[06:17:40.220 --> 06:17:42.220]  Why aren't people more upset about that
[06:17:43.220 --> 06:17:44.220]  Look at all the people that died
[06:17:45.220 --> 06:17:46.220]  And look at how the government is setting on the evidence
[06:17:47.220 --> 06:17:48.220]  Obstructing the evidence
[06:17:49.220 --> 06:17:50.220]  Hiding and destroying the evidence
[06:17:51.220 --> 06:17:52.220]  Why aren't people mad about that
[06:17:53.220 --> 06:17:54.220]  Why aren't they pursuing the truth
[06:17:55.220 --> 06:17:56.220]  They call us truthers
[06:17:56.220 --> 06:17:58.220]  It's the opposite of a truther, it's a liar
[06:17:59.220 --> 06:18:00.220]  Why aren't they upset with liars
[06:18:01.220 --> 06:18:02.220]  Why are they upset with truthers
[06:18:03.220 --> 06:18:04.220]  Do we have that I'm as mad as hell clip
[06:18:05.220 --> 06:18:06.220]  Do we have that
[06:18:07.220 --> 06:18:08.220]  Okay, well we'll have to get that at some point
[06:18:09.220 --> 06:18:10.220]  Maybe I have the movie, I might go home and get it
[06:18:11.220 --> 06:18:12.220]  Alright, thank you for your call
[06:18:13.220 --> 06:18:14.220]  Jim and Georgia, we're going to move quick
[06:18:15.220 --> 06:18:16.220]  We only have about 10 minutes or so left
[06:18:17.220 --> 06:18:18.220]  Let's go to Andrew in Illinois
[06:18:19.220 --> 06:18:22.220]  It's more looking about Sandy Hook
[06:18:23.220 --> 06:18:24.220]  Hold on, hold on, hold on
[06:18:24.220 --> 06:18:25.220]  I'm sorry
[06:18:26.220 --> 06:18:27.220]  Let's get Leeann McAdoo in here, Leeann come on
[06:18:28.220 --> 06:18:29.220]  No Leeann, you get in here and make your point
[06:18:30.220 --> 06:18:32.220]  Gray backpack folks, she's right, it's not black, it's gray
[06:18:33.220 --> 06:18:34.220]  Go ahead and tell people
[06:18:35.220 --> 06:18:37.220]  It's a gray backpack, right?
[06:18:38.220 --> 06:18:40.220]  I mean, can we see the footage?
[06:18:41.220 --> 06:18:42.220]  No, no, you're right, I saw it
[06:18:43.220 --> 06:18:45.220]  The guy's got a gray backpack, those were black backpacks
[06:18:46.220 --> 06:18:49.220]  So this rabbit trail doesn't even fit the script
[06:18:50.220 --> 06:18:52.220]  Do we have some new information there?
[06:18:52.220 --> 06:18:53.220]  No, no, no
[06:18:54.220 --> 06:18:55.220]  No, this is war room
[06:18:56.220 --> 06:18:57.220]  Hey, want to get a seat and come in here and there?
[06:18:58.220 --> 06:18:59.220]  No, no, hold on, I'm going to say this
[06:19:00.220 --> 06:19:01.220]  Because I've been telling her this all week
[06:19:02.220 --> 06:19:03.220]  And David, you can attest to this
[06:19:04.220 --> 06:19:05.220]  I told Leeann, if you don't come in here
[06:19:06.220 --> 06:19:07.220]  And just briefly do just a quick report
[06:19:08.220 --> 06:19:09.220]  Or just say something
[06:19:10.220 --> 06:19:11.220]  Alex Jones is going to find you in the hall
[06:19:12.220 --> 06:19:13.220]  Drag you in here and make you get on
[06:19:14.220 --> 06:19:15.220]  I've been saying that all week
[06:19:16.220 --> 06:19:17.220]  Hold on, let's get her a chair
[06:19:18.220 --> 06:19:19.220]  See, now you're in it
[06:19:19.220 --> 06:19:21.220]  Leeann McAdoo, one of our new reporters here in the info war
[06:19:22.220 --> 06:19:24.220]  She will be joining us for the next 10 minutes
[06:19:25.220 --> 06:19:27.220]  Call in and have a question for Leeann ready
[06:19:28.220 --> 06:19:30.220]  All right, so we'll move on now to Andrew in Illinois
[06:19:31.220 --> 06:19:32.220]  Do you have a question for Leeann?
[06:19:33.220 --> 06:19:34.220]  No, I don't, I just had a comment to check out
[06:19:35.220 --> 06:19:37.220]  That they were set up for the Sandy Hook
[06:19:38.220 --> 06:19:40.220]  A half hour before the shooting they had refreshments
[06:19:41.220 --> 06:19:43.220]  The federal people are already at the firehouse
[06:19:44.220 --> 06:19:46.220]  There's a tape on YouTube showing us
[06:19:46.220 --> 06:19:48.220]  I thought you'd like to know that
[06:19:49.220 --> 06:19:50.220]  I'm sorry, did you get set, Jacari?
[06:19:51.220 --> 06:19:52.220]  No, I'm sorry, we had a little technical difficulty
[06:19:53.220 --> 06:19:54.220]  Can you repeat?
[06:19:55.220 --> 06:19:56.220]  Yeah, they were supposedly set up a half hour before the shooting
[06:19:57.220 --> 06:19:58.220]  Hold on, we got double plugs here
[06:19:59.220 --> 06:20:01.220]  I'm sorry, I'm sorry, Andrew, we're going to put you on hold
[06:20:02.220 --> 06:20:03.220]  We have like 10 people talking in here at the same time
[06:20:04.220 --> 06:20:05.220]  Yeah, hang on just one second
[06:20:06.220 --> 06:20:07.220]  Doesn't matter, it's live
[06:20:08.220 --> 06:20:09.220]  This is live and we're getting Leeann hooked up here
[06:20:10.220 --> 06:20:11.220]  So she can hear your comments as well
[06:20:12.220 --> 06:20:13.220]  So she can comment
[06:20:13.220 --> 06:20:15.220]  Right now she doesn't have any way to hear you
[06:20:16.220 --> 06:20:19.220]  Okay, so we're working through some technical difficulties
[06:20:20.220 --> 06:20:21.220]  And then we're going to get you to go back over what you just told us again
[06:20:22.220 --> 06:20:23.220]  We wanted to hear what you had to say
[06:20:24.220 --> 06:20:25.220]  Yeah, this is important because when she said it, it clicked
[06:20:26.220 --> 06:20:27.220]  The backpack's grey, it's not black
[06:20:28.220 --> 06:20:29.220]  Explain, you got audio now?
[06:20:30.220 --> 06:20:32.220]  Okay, can somebody help her with her earpiece, it's all sticking out
[06:20:33.220 --> 06:20:34.220]  She's got audio now, you're good
[06:20:35.220 --> 06:20:38.220]  Okay, alright, we'll go back to Andrew in a second
[06:20:39.220 --> 06:20:40.220]  But first, Leeann, make your point about the backpack
[06:20:40.220 --> 06:20:44.220]  So I was looking, they're playing the footage over and over and over again
[06:20:45.220 --> 06:20:47.220]  And it just struck me that the backpack, it's grey
[06:20:48.220 --> 06:20:52.220]  It doesn't match all of the photos of the backpacks they've been showing that are black
[06:20:53.220 --> 06:20:54.220]  And they have just one grey stripe
[06:20:55.220 --> 06:20:56.220]  This is a grey backpack
[06:20:57.220 --> 06:20:59.220]  You can see it right there if you're watching on Infowars.com
[06:21:00.220 --> 06:21:02.220]  They keep showing these backpacks that are black or dark colored
[06:21:03.220 --> 06:21:07.220]  Yeah, and then not only that, but they say they have footage of him setting the backpack down
[06:21:07.220 --> 06:21:12.220]  Well, I already thought that, plus the black backpack's not big enough for a pressure cooker
[06:21:13.220 --> 06:21:14.220]  This is a total rabbit trail
[06:21:15.220 --> 06:21:17.220]  Yeah, and it doesn't even look like it has anything in the backpack
[06:21:18.220 --> 06:21:19.220]  And he's kind of swinging it around
[06:21:20.220 --> 06:21:24.220]  I mean, if you had a bomb in your backpack, you'd probably have the straps on
[06:21:25.220 --> 06:21:26.220]  You wouldn't just be...
[06:21:27.220 --> 06:21:29.220]  Nonchalantly just like you didn't have a bomb in your backpack
[06:21:30.220 --> 06:21:31.220]  Great point
[06:21:32.220 --> 06:21:34.220]  Okay, now we'll go back to Andrew in Illinois and then try to get through the rest of these calls
[06:21:34.220 --> 06:21:36.220]  Andrew, go ahead
[06:21:37.220 --> 06:21:39.220]  Okay, I just want to make a mention of YouTube that's out there now
[06:21:40.220 --> 06:21:43.220]  It's titled Sandy Hook Conspiracy from Live Drill, Live Oaks
[06:21:44.220 --> 06:21:47.220]  It shows pictures of them being set up a half hour before the event
[06:21:48.220 --> 06:21:49.220]  Who being set up?
[06:21:50.220 --> 06:21:51.220]  With the refreshments and the feds were there already
[06:21:52.220 --> 06:21:53.220]  This guy witnessed it
[06:21:54.220 --> 06:21:55.220]  You can find it, look it up that way
[06:21:56.220 --> 06:21:57.220]  It's a four minute video
[06:21:58.220 --> 06:21:59.220]  Can you give us the title again?
[06:21:59.220 --> 06:22:03.220]  Yes, Sandy Hook Conspiracy from Live Drill to Live Oaks
[06:22:04.220 --> 06:22:06.220]  Sandy Hook, only known eyewitness account
[06:22:07.220 --> 06:22:08.220]  Okay, we'll look at that
[06:22:09.220 --> 06:22:10.220]  We're looking through some other things
[06:22:11.220 --> 06:22:12.220]  But we'll definitely try to take a look at that
[06:22:13.220 --> 06:22:15.220]  Also check out the Iroquois Gas Company buying up the land
[06:22:16.220 --> 06:22:18.220]  All around there as of 2009
[06:22:19.220 --> 06:22:21.220]  The researcher found several of their homes vacant
[06:22:22.220 --> 06:22:23.220]  They were listed as witness homes
[06:22:24.220 --> 06:22:25.220]  Okay
[06:22:26.220 --> 06:22:27.220]  We lost audio
[06:22:27.220 --> 06:22:28.220]  I'm sorry Andrew
[06:22:29.220 --> 06:22:30.220]  Okay, thank you for your call
[06:22:31.220 --> 06:22:32.220]  Thank you
[06:22:33.220 --> 06:22:34.220]  Okay, thank you
[06:22:35.220 --> 06:22:36.220]  Alright, we'll move on now to Dave in Colorado
[06:22:37.220 --> 06:22:38.220]  Hello
[06:22:39.220 --> 06:22:40.220]  Yes, go ahead
[06:22:41.220 --> 06:22:43.220]  Yes, I was watching that newscast that reminded me of that
[06:22:44.220 --> 06:22:46.220]  Police Captain Vance from Sandy Hook
[06:22:47.220 --> 06:22:52.220]  Where no information should be taken unless it's from this official outlet
[06:22:53.220 --> 06:22:54.220]  Whatever it was
[06:22:54.220 --> 06:22:57.220]  Absolutely, good point
[06:22:58.220 --> 06:23:01.220]  I know you guys have gotten tons of pictures
[06:23:02.220 --> 06:23:05.220]  But the SEALs or the security team
[06:23:06.220 --> 06:23:09.220]  If you go to cryptone.org
[06:23:11.220 --> 06:23:14.220]  C-R-Y-P-T-O-M-E.org
[06:23:15.220 --> 06:23:17.220]  Go to the Boston blast
[06:23:19.220 --> 06:23:20.220]  And bomb blast
[06:23:20.220 --> 06:23:23.220]  And you scroll down about 21 pictures from there
[06:23:24.220 --> 06:23:27.220]  You'll see them all gathered around an SUV
[06:23:28.220 --> 06:23:30.220]  With all sorts of high tech antennas
[06:23:31.220 --> 06:23:32.220]  I know you have a lot of calls coming in
[06:23:33.220 --> 06:23:34.220]  I just wanted to get that in
[06:23:35.220 --> 06:23:36.220]  Okay, thank you sir
[06:23:37.220 --> 06:23:38.220]  We'll try to check that out
[06:23:39.220 --> 06:23:40.220]  Yeah, it's all about sharing information
[06:23:41.220 --> 06:23:42.220]  We all need to get anything you see
[06:23:43.220 --> 06:23:44.220]  You need to let us know about it
[06:23:45.220 --> 06:23:46.220]  Let other people know about it
[06:23:47.220 --> 06:23:48.220]  Yeah, and we do take these calls seriously
[06:23:48.220 --> 06:23:49.220]  The guy getting his papers checked
[06:23:50.220 --> 06:23:51.220]  That was a caller who called in on the radio show
[06:23:52.220 --> 06:23:53.220]  So we do get to those when we can
[06:23:54.220 --> 06:23:55.220]  Thank you for your call sir
[06:23:56.220 --> 06:23:57.220]  We'll move on now to Sam in California
[06:23:58.220 --> 06:23:59.220]  How's it going fellas?
[06:24:00.220 --> 06:24:01.220]  Very well
[06:24:02.220 --> 06:24:04.220]  What bothers me here is a little bit of what we're not talking about
[06:24:05.220 --> 06:24:08.220]  The FBI gets up there and shows us two pictures of guys
[06:24:09.220 --> 06:24:10.220]  They need us to find
[06:24:11.220 --> 06:24:12.220]  I mean, they've got all that money
[06:24:13.220 --> 06:24:14.220]  They have facial rec, they have fusion centers
[06:24:15.220 --> 06:24:16.220]  They've got DMV and passport photos
[06:24:16.220 --> 06:24:17.220]  They've got cell tracking
[06:24:18.220 --> 06:24:19.220]  They've got satellite tracking
[06:24:20.220 --> 06:24:21.220]  You're telling me they couldn't go back in real time to the satellite
[06:24:22.220 --> 06:24:23.220]  And follow these guys to their front door?
[06:24:24.220 --> 06:24:25.220]  Yeah, that's what I was thinking
[06:24:26.220 --> 06:24:27.220]  Because when the guy asked, he said
[06:24:28.220 --> 06:24:29.220]  What happened after the bombs went off?
[06:24:30.220 --> 06:24:31.220]  He said, we saw them walk down the street
[06:24:32.220 --> 06:24:33.220]  And we never saw them again
[06:24:34.220 --> 06:24:35.220]  I thought that was very suspicious
[06:24:36.220 --> 06:24:37.220]  Especially for somebody who has the resources of the FBI
[06:24:38.220 --> 06:24:39.220]  Yeah, did they wait this long to tell us that
[06:24:40.220 --> 06:24:41.220]  And then they don't really know where these guys went
[06:24:42.220 --> 06:24:43.220]  And their footage
[06:24:43.220 --> 06:24:45.220]  So maybe a couple minutes, did they have enough time to get away from them
[06:24:46.220 --> 06:24:47.220]  Before the bombs went off
[06:24:48.220 --> 06:24:49.220]  If they saw them put packages down
[06:24:50.220 --> 06:24:53.220]  And they didn't show any pictures of them putting the backpacks down
[06:24:54.220 --> 06:24:55.220]  Exactly
[06:24:56.220 --> 06:24:57.220]  But honestly, even if there was cloud cover
[06:24:58.220 --> 06:24:59.220]  And the satellites weren't an option
[06:25:00.220 --> 06:25:01.220]  We could upload their pictures to Facebook
[06:25:02.220 --> 06:25:03.220]  And probably facial rec them in under two minutes
[06:25:04.220 --> 06:25:05.220]  With social media
[06:25:06.220 --> 06:25:07.220]  It's such a con and nonsense
[06:25:08.220 --> 06:25:09.220]  It's exasperating
[06:25:10.220 --> 06:25:11.220]  They want you to be involved
[06:25:11.220 --> 06:25:12.220]  It's like, you know, when you're a little kid
[06:25:13.220 --> 06:25:14.220]  And your dad's like, here, come push the lawnmower
[06:25:15.220 --> 06:25:16.220]  And you can't even push it, he has to push it for you
[06:25:17.220 --> 06:25:18.220]  Well didn't he say, you're our eyes and ears
[06:25:19.220 --> 06:25:20.220]  But then he doesn't want us to look at anything else
[06:25:21.220 --> 06:25:22.220]  Right
[06:25:23.220 --> 06:25:24.220]  If they really need our help that bad
[06:25:25.220 --> 06:25:26.220]  We needed to fund them completely
[06:25:27.220 --> 06:25:28.220]  Now we just do the job ourselves
[06:25:29.220 --> 06:25:30.220]  And the other thing I wanted to say
[06:25:31.220 --> 06:25:32.220]  The guy in the picture yesterday with the blue jacket and the red shirt on
[06:25:33.220 --> 06:25:35.220]  He was blatantly the patsy that was setting up to be the NRA guy with the ammo
[06:25:36.220 --> 06:25:37.220]  But if you look at the guy's face
[06:25:38.220 --> 06:25:39.220]  There's a documentary called The Devil's Breath about Scoponi
[06:25:39.220 --> 06:25:40.220]  The guy looked like a Scoponi victim
[06:25:41.220 --> 06:25:42.220]  And it's actually the perfect drug for creating patsies
[06:25:43.220 --> 06:25:44.220]  I'm sure they've got a hybridized, weaponized version of it
[06:25:45.220 --> 06:25:46.220]  That's even more efficient
[06:25:47.220 --> 06:25:48.220]  But if you go watch the documentary
[06:25:49.220 --> 06:25:50.220]  It explains to every patsy that's ever committed
[06:25:51.220 --> 06:25:52.220]  A shooting or a bombing or any nonsense
[06:25:53.220 --> 06:25:54.220]  That's been a false flag attempt
[06:25:55.220 --> 06:25:56.220]  This Scoponi is the perfect drug for that
[06:25:57.220 --> 06:25:58.220]  Okay, thank you for your call, sir
[06:25:59.220 --> 06:26:00.220]  We'll look into that
[06:26:01.220 --> 06:26:02.220]  But we have to keep moving
[06:26:03.220 --> 06:26:04.220]  Only about five minutes left
[06:26:05.220 --> 06:26:06.220]  Do you have a comment, David?
[06:26:06.220 --> 06:26:08.220]  I was just going to say, yeah, that drug is something that can basically blow into your face
[06:26:09.220 --> 06:26:10.220]  And you'll follow any suggestion that anybody tells you
[06:26:11.220 --> 06:26:12.220]  It's pretty amazing, actually
[06:26:13.220 --> 06:26:14.220]  Okay, we have about six or seven calls left
[06:26:15.220 --> 06:26:16.220]  Make your point very quickly
[06:26:17.220 --> 06:26:18.220]  We'll go to Toni in Arizona
[06:26:19.220 --> 06:26:20.220]  Hi, I just have a comment
[06:26:21.220 --> 06:26:22.220]  On the FBI pictures of the backpacks that were exploded
[06:26:23.220 --> 06:26:24.220]  They have those gray stripes on the straps
[06:26:25.220 --> 06:26:26.220]  The shoulder straps
[06:26:27.220 --> 06:26:28.220]  And that's exactly what we're going to do
[06:26:29.220 --> 06:26:30.220]  We're going to take a look
[06:26:31.220 --> 06:26:32.220]  We're going to take a look
[06:26:33.220 --> 06:26:34.220]  We're going to take a look
[06:26:34.220 --> 06:26:35.220]  They have those shoulder straps
[06:26:36.220 --> 06:26:38.220]  And that's exactly like the pappy guy with the blue shirt
[06:26:39.220 --> 06:26:41.220]  And he's also holding that very low
[06:26:42.220 --> 06:26:46.220]  So that it wouldn't be really seen in pictures
[06:26:47.220 --> 06:26:48.220]  And that it's heavy
[06:26:49.220 --> 06:26:50.220]  He needed two hands to hold that up
[06:26:51.220 --> 06:26:52.220]  So I don't know
[06:26:53.220 --> 06:26:57.220]  To me, that one, those gray stripes just match exactly to the exploded pictures
[06:26:58.220 --> 06:26:59.220]  That's what you were saying?
[06:27:00.220 --> 06:27:01.220]  Okay, thank you
[06:27:01.220 --> 06:27:04.620]  Well, we have to keep moving, we only have about four minutes left less than that.
[06:27:04.620 --> 06:27:05.620]  Julie in California.
[06:27:05.620 --> 06:27:06.620]  Hi, yeah.
[06:27:06.620 --> 06:27:13.340]  You know, I just want to let you guys know, I mean, last, probably last two or three nights,
[06:27:13.340 --> 06:27:18.460]  we've had, you know, the helicopters flying all over the night, and I mean, and I know
[06:27:18.460 --> 06:27:23.860]  they're military helicopters, I know the difference between, you know, the regular LAPD helicopters
[06:27:23.860 --> 06:27:29.540]  and whatnot, and they're flying all overnight, and I noticed the last three or four days,
[06:27:29.540 --> 06:27:33.220]  we've had nothing but police presence all around town.
[06:27:33.220 --> 06:27:37.100]  I mean, you can't go on a street and there is not a cop.
[06:27:37.100 --> 06:27:38.100]  What town are you in?
[06:27:38.100 --> 06:27:42.060]  I mean, it's all over, it's creepy almost.
[06:27:42.060 --> 06:27:44.060]  Are you saying you're in LA?
[06:27:44.060 --> 06:27:50.700]  Yeah, I'm in Los Angeles, I'm in Northridge, but I'm in LA City proper, and I mean, it's
[06:27:50.700 --> 06:27:51.700]  all over.
[06:27:51.700 --> 06:27:56.580]  I mean, you hear the choppers at night, you know they're military, you know they're not
[06:27:56.580 --> 06:28:01.860]  just LAPD helicopters, and, you know, you see the cops on the street, I mean, you know.
[06:28:01.860 --> 06:28:07.220]  Yes, miss, the thing to do about that is just grab your camera, grab your camera, go outside
[06:28:07.220 --> 06:28:10.620]  and film it cuz Joe Biden and these other people are saying that's not happening.
[06:28:10.620 --> 06:28:13.580]  So prove them wrong, film it and put it on YouTube, we have to move quick.
[06:28:13.580 --> 06:28:16.820]  Oh, great, because I got- Jason, I'm sorry, miss, Jason in Tennessee,
[06:28:16.820 --> 06:28:17.820]  go ahead.
[06:28:17.820 --> 06:28:18.820]  How's it going, guys?
[06:28:18.820 --> 06:28:19.820]  Good.
[06:28:19.820 --> 06:28:21.820]  I'll be real quick, I just wanted to make a comment.
[06:28:21.820 --> 06:28:25.540]  I was actually monitoring Hannity's show to see what they were having to say about everything
[06:28:25.540 --> 06:28:30.460]  when the news conference came on, and he said they're gonna cover this thing in its entirety
[06:28:30.460 --> 06:28:31.460]  with no commercial breaks.
[06:28:31.460 --> 06:28:36.900]  And as soon as I started hearing Dan behind these seats, they came right back about a
[06:28:36.900 --> 06:28:40.300]  minute later, and then I heard them talking again, they cut away, and for the rest of
[06:28:40.300 --> 06:28:43.060]  the time, there was nothing there but commercials.
[06:28:43.060 --> 06:28:46.740]  Awesome, somebody put that on YouTube right now, thank you for your call, so we have to
[06:28:46.740 --> 06:28:47.740]  move quick.
[06:28:47.740 --> 06:28:48.740]  Chris in Connecticut.
[06:28:48.740 --> 06:28:49.740]  Yes, sir.
[06:28:49.740 --> 06:28:50.740]  How's it going?
[06:28:50.740 --> 06:28:51.740]  Yes, you have about one minute.
[06:28:51.740 --> 06:28:56.500]  Yes, sir, I got two things to say really quick.
[06:28:56.500 --> 06:29:03.340]  One is that I saw this uploaded video online, and it showed really graphic, it showed there
[06:29:03.340 --> 06:29:08.860]  is some gore on the aftermath of the Boston Marathon bombing.
[06:29:08.860 --> 06:29:11.060]  And as soon as one of the- 30 seconds, go ahead.
[06:29:11.060 --> 06:29:15.420]  One of the officers had walked by, and the gore was completely gone, covering some kind
[06:29:15.420 --> 06:29:17.020]  of a metal object.
[06:29:17.020 --> 06:29:23.980]  And secondly, I just saw 104.1 post up, and they were saying, this is a mainstream new
[06:29:23.980 --> 06:29:29.940]  media broadcast, and they were saying, anybody that knows the pictures of these updated FBI
[06:29:29.940 --> 06:29:33.420]  release photos, you could know somebody who knows somebody who knows somebody, is just
[06:29:33.420 --> 06:29:36.320]  trying to cause social chaos.
[06:29:36.320 --> 06:29:39.620]  Anybody can point the finger at anybody, so who's the terrorist?
[06:29:39.620 --> 06:29:42.060]  Anybody could be a terrorist, a look-alike could be a terrorist, so they're just trying
[06:29:42.060 --> 06:29:46.060]  to cause division through the nation.
[06:29:46.060 --> 06:29:51.980]  And fear, they're trying to create a climate of fear so they can push through their agenda
[06:29:51.980 --> 06:29:54.020]  that is supposed to come after this.
[06:29:54.020 --> 06:29:58.700]  We have 10 seconds, thank you everybody for watching the Alex Jones Radio Show, this extended
[06:29:58.700 --> 06:29:59.700]  edition.
