[00:00.000 --> 00:13.000]  Hello, this is Hank Hill, and I'm telling you what, you need to listen to Alex Jones.
[00:13.000 --> 00:20.000]  And for worth.com, yeah.
[00:20.000 --> 00:40.000]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:40.000 --> 00:50.000]  A worldwide live broadcast on this Sunday, the 24th day of May, 2015. I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[00:50.000 --> 00:54.000]  We'll be here for the next two hours as we are every Sunday, four to six, back weekdays.
[00:54.000 --> 01:01.000]  11 a.m. to 2 p.m. Central Standard Time. Again, I am your host, Alex Jones.
[01:01.000 --> 01:10.000]  There is no shortage of dynamic over the top, world-changing, incredibly important news as the quickening on this globe accelerates.
[01:10.000 --> 01:20.000]  The operative word is accelerates, speeds up, intensifies, waxes.
[01:20.000 --> 01:30.000]  But the first thing we're going to be covering in great detail is the passage Friday afternoon of the TPP.
[01:30.000 --> 01:36.000]  The Trans-Pacific Partnership that is global government on steroids.
[01:36.000 --> 01:49.000]  It's global government on parade, because it's not just global government, it's secret, arbitrary, dictatorial world government.
[01:49.000 --> 02:07.000]  And it's even got Google and another 240 plus major Fortune 1000, Fortune 100, Fortune 500 companies coming out and saying do not agree to this.
[02:07.000 --> 02:22.000]  And you know why? Because WikiLeaks a year and a half ago leaked the one section of 30 plus on internet freedom and it allows governments and select corporations to take over the internet and in free species.
[02:22.000 --> 02:31.000]  We know it. And Google, I'm not romanticizing Google, far from it, but this is the famous separation of powers that our founders talked about.
[02:31.000 --> 02:41.000]  Google wants to keep its power. It's forming its own planetary AI system and it recognizes this as a totalitarian takeover, a seizure of its empire.
[02:41.000 --> 02:56.000]  And it's saying no. What does it tell you when 250 of the top tech companies are vehemently against it?
[02:56.000 --> 03:05.000]  And by the way, Apple, Google, Microsoft, they are filled with the highest levels of government intelligence agency operatives and others.
[03:05.000 --> 03:14.000]  What does it tell you when they are vehemently opposed to it?
[03:14.000 --> 03:18.000]  And then you've got the extreme left and the extreme right as the media calls it.
[03:18.000 --> 03:36.000]  Now, you've got real liberals and then real conservatives, people that don't want to be under total tyranny against it. And so, meanwhile, you've got the Republican leadership voting with the Democratic leadership to overrule the grassroots of both parties to pass this out of the Senate and now goes to the house.
[03:36.000 --> 03:43.000]  We're going to go over the whole stinking thing coming up here today.
[03:43.000 --> 03:49.000]  Hundreds of tech companies line up to oppose TPP trade agreement.
[03:49.000 --> 04:04.000]  Letters sign them more than 250 companies to man greater transparency and say dangerously vague language would criminalize whistleblowers.
[04:04.000 --> 04:13.000]  So we're going to go over this today, but I know what's in the TPP because I know how the EU is set up. I know how the NAU is set up.
[04:13.000 --> 04:22.000]  I know how the trilateral plan is set up. In fact, you guys also print me very cold waters quotes from no apologies on the trilateral commission.
[04:22.000 --> 04:32.000]  I read those pretty much every week now, but you might want to hear what the US Senator who was privy to some of the secret congressional hearings on it on the planetary trilateral plan.
[04:32.000 --> 04:39.000]  And he came in with a whistle. So did Senator Church and others. Bipartisan.
[04:39.000 --> 04:47.000]  There was also a fascist takeover plan in the 30s that got the whistle blown on it by the most highly decorated Marine in history, General Spendley Butler.
[04:47.000 --> 04:54.000]  So we stopped these takeovers before. We're going to do it again, but believe me, this is an intense time to be alive.
[04:54.000 --> 04:58.000]  We need every man and woman on deck all hands. This is a fight.
[04:58.000 --> 05:05.000]  For all of recorded history, civilizations around the world praised the health benefits of silver.
[05:05.000 --> 05:15.000]  At InfoWarsLife, our mission is to bring you the highest quality, purest, cleanest, effective colloidal silver on the market's day for the lowest price available.

[06:20.000 --> 06:35.000]  Well, the Secretary of Defense is criticizing the Iraqi military for running away from Ramadi and running away from ISIS.
[06:35.000 --> 06:39.000]  And turning about a third of Iraq over to the al-Qaeda-based group.
[06:39.000 --> 06:40.000]  That's who they are.
[06:40.000 --> 06:41.000]  Wahhabi is not a Saudi Arabia.
[06:41.000 --> 06:43.000]  That's who runs the whole operation.
[06:43.000 --> 06:44.000]  That's who coaches it.
[06:44.000 --> 06:45.000]  That's who funds it.
[06:45.000 --> 06:51.000]  And then, of course, they've got more than half of Syria now and are making gains.
[06:51.000 --> 06:59.000]  And it's very interesting that our own government openly funded these groups.
[06:59.000 --> 07:14.000]  And then now is criticizing the Iraqi military because they can't defeat them when it's our government and our media and our political elite that went into Iraq, destabilized the country, kicked out the government,
[07:14.000 --> 07:19.000]  and then now have basically broken it in three parts, Kurd, Shiite, and Sunni.
[07:19.000 --> 07:25.000]  Sunnis, the main group that al-Qaeda is within.
[07:25.000 --> 07:33.000]  And they just think the public is so geopolitically illiterate that they're not aware of what's happened here.
[07:33.000 --> 07:43.000]  This is the planned breakup of Iraq and Syria, which General Wesley Clark admitted to 10 years ago in two different speeches he gave.
[07:43.000 --> 07:45.000]  And which has been partially declassified.
[07:45.000 --> 07:55.000]  So coming up at the bottom of the hour, I have several mainstream news articles reporting on judicial watch.
[07:55.000 --> 08:11.000]  Just got the Defense Intelligence classified report from 2012 admitting the plan to put al-Qaeda, a.k.a. ISIS, in control of Syria.
[08:11.000 --> 08:13.000]  Talk about a war crime.
[08:13.000 --> 08:18.000]  And that's not blaming our rank and fall troops or even the top generals who've been vehemently against this.
[08:18.000 --> 08:23.000]  That's why two years ago they said we're not going to be the Air Force for al-Qaeda to overthrow Assad.
[08:23.000 --> 08:25.000]  And they had to back off part of this plan.
[08:25.000 --> 08:32.000]  But that's who runs our country and that's the orders that are being given to the Pentagon to carry out.
[08:32.000 --> 08:43.000]  And it's caused the greatest internal mutiny against tyranny I think I've ever seen in my study of 240 years of the U.S. government.
[08:43.000 --> 08:45.000]  So some very positive things are happening.
[08:45.000 --> 08:51.000]  I mean, if Obama ordered the military to nuke every U.S. city, would it be treason for them not to follow the order?
[08:51.000 --> 08:53.000]  No, it'd be treason to follow the order.
[08:53.000 --> 08:59.000]  We've now reached hitlerian levels with the bureaucracy and the executive branch at the top.
[08:59.000 --> 09:02.000]  They are out of their minds insane.
[09:02.000 --> 09:04.000]  Here are the articles. They're up on inforwars.com.
[09:04.000 --> 09:14.000]  Secret Pentagon report reveals U.S. created, that's close quote, ISIS as a quote tool to overthrow Syrian president Assad.
[09:14.000 --> 09:20.000]  Now I know you know that and Colonel Shaver's been on and Dr. Corsi's been on and countless experts.
[09:20.000 --> 09:25.000]  But now judicial watch has the smoking gun.
[09:25.000 --> 09:27.000]  Huge.
[09:27.000 --> 09:29.000]  DIA docs.
[09:29.000 --> 09:37.000]  West wants a Salafist principality in eastern Syria in order to isolate the Syrian regime.
[09:37.000 --> 09:39.000]  Again, that's declassified.
[09:39.000 --> 09:41.000]  And who is that?
[09:41.000 --> 09:46.000]  That's Wahhabist, Sunni, Muslim Brotherhood.
[09:46.000 --> 09:49.000]  So that's just some of what is coming up today on that front.
[09:49.000 --> 09:54.000]  Simply huge.
[09:54.000 --> 09:59.000]  But mainstream media will not report on this and that's why they're losing all their viewers and all their readers.
[09:59.000 --> 10:01.000]  Here's a headline.
[10:01.000 --> 10:03.000]  Rip.
[10:03.000 --> 10:08.000]  Over 100 newspapers dumped in a year adds down 50%.
[10:08.000 --> 10:10.000]  Circulation hits bottom.
[10:10.000 --> 10:17.000]  That's what's happening to the mainstream media.
[10:17.000 --> 10:23.000]  And no amount of manipulation is going to save them.
[10:23.000 --> 10:28.000]  That's why they want to try to censor the new media because we explode.
[10:28.000 --> 10:30.000]  We grow because we tell the truth.
[10:30.000 --> 10:31.000]  We at least try to tell the truth.
[10:31.000 --> 10:32.000]  We don't have all the answers.
[10:32.000 --> 10:33.000]  We're not perfect.
[10:33.000 --> 10:39.000]  But our hearts in the right place and we've got a much better scorecard than they do.
[10:39.000 --> 10:41.000]  We'll talk about that more.
[10:41.000 --> 10:47.000]  Now our top story before I get into all of the other news that's here.
[10:47.000 --> 10:54.000]  And Joe Biggs will join us from Cleveland where they had the verdict yesterday and some looting, a little bit of stuff being broken on a lot of rioting.
[10:54.000 --> 10:56.000]  71 arrests by police.
[10:56.000 --> 10:58.000]  Joe Biggs is there right now.
[10:58.000 --> 11:00.000]  He'll be joining us in about an hour from now.
[11:00.000 --> 11:10.000]  A little bit into the second hour from Cleveland via video Skype to give us his on the ground breakdown of what he witnessed there.
[11:10.000 --> 11:21.000]  But before I go any further, I got off the radio Friday.
[11:21.000 --> 11:32.000]  And I had mentioned on air during the show, during the middle of the show, the weekday broadcast, that oh yes, the TPP, the Trans-Pacific Partnership has passed the Senate.
[11:32.000 --> 11:40.000]  And I realized as I got off air, I said, you know, I talked about that probably 30 minutes of the last hour and a half of the show.
[11:40.000 --> 11:43.000]  And I was upset about it and I talked about how horrible it was.
[11:43.000 --> 11:54.000]  But I kind of have this normalcy bias where I've been expecting this evil for so long and I've lived under far and globalist domination for so long.
[11:54.000 --> 12:01.000]  Domination of my taxes, of the regulations I live under, seeing my republic slowly strangled to death.
[12:01.000 --> 12:05.000]  I've lived under it so long that I had become comfortable with it.
[12:05.000 --> 12:09.000]  Then I got more and more upset.
[12:09.000 --> 12:13.000]  Then I got home, hung out with the children and the family.
[12:13.000 --> 12:14.000]  They went to bed.
[12:14.000 --> 12:22.000]  I went in and fired the computer on and began to read news about TPP and there was Matt Drudge tweeting, Republicans are committing suicide.
[12:22.000 --> 12:32.000]  It's absolutely horrible. Why are we allowing them to give a limited authority to Obama on a secret global piece of legislation?
[12:32.000 --> 12:34.000]  And it made me think.
[12:34.000 --> 12:38.000]  So I did a lot of research on top of the years of research I've done.
[12:38.000 --> 12:41.000]  They've been negotiating with TPP for 15-plus years.
[12:41.000 --> 12:45.000]  And I tell you, my blood is just boiling at this point.
[12:45.000 --> 12:52.000]  There is a big opportunity, though, in this.
[12:52.000 --> 13:04.000]  Because I've never seen mainline liberals and mainline Republicans, mainline conservatives, finally getting it and finally understanding what's happening.
[13:04.000 --> 13:08.000]  Because they've had the Southern Primary Law Center and MSNBC for years say,
[13:08.000 --> 13:15.000]  if you talk about a global corporate, unaccountable government, you are insane when it blows up buildings. It just does not exist.
[13:15.000 --> 13:22.000]  Even though we've seen it forming, even though Barry Goldwater warned about it,
[13:22.000 --> 13:29.000]  even though Ron Paul and myself and countless others have warned about it,
[13:29.000 --> 13:34.000]  still, they just denied, denied, denied.
[13:34.000 --> 13:42.000]  There's no death panels in Obamacare. There's no plan to come after your guns. There's no, there's no.
[13:42.000 --> 13:47.000]  What did Barry Goldwater, in no apologies, 1964 say of the senator?
[13:47.000 --> 13:51.000]  The guy that almost beat Lyndon Mains Johnson.
[13:51.000 --> 14:01.000]  The Trilateral Commission is intended to be the vehicle for multinational consolidation of the commercial and banking interest by season control of the political government of the United States.
[14:01.000 --> 14:11.000]  That's called dictatorship, by the way. The Trilateral Commission represents a skillful coordinated effort to seize control and consolidate the four centers of power,
[14:11.000 --> 14:16.000]  political, monetary, intellectual, and ecclesiastical, that's state-run religion.
[14:16.000 --> 14:25.000]  What the Trilateral Commission intends is to create a worldwide economic power superior to the political governments of the nation states involved.
[14:25.000 --> 14:33.000]  As managers and creators of the systems, they will rule the future. I wish I could write like that or talk like Senator Barry Goldwater.
[14:33.000 --> 14:39.000]  Imagine if he would have gotten elected running against LBJ in 1964.
[14:39.000 --> 14:48.000]  And man, his campaign was like Alex Jones, but in a nice suit with three college degrees and a successful entrepreneur,
[14:48.000 --> 14:59.000]  they own shopping malls around the country. Imagine, it was like Alex Jones in a fancy suit up there saying exactly what I say.
[14:59.000 --> 15:04.000]  And America didn't elect him.
[15:04.000 --> 15:13.000]  And then here we are later, just now getting the point where the public will start looking at what's really going on again.
[15:13.000 --> 15:19.000]  I mean, Ronald Reagan gave speeches like that when he was running for the presidency in 1979.
[15:19.000 --> 15:25.000]  He quoted Barry Goldwater. America knew this. America held a lot of this back.
[15:25.000 --> 15:34.000]  And then by the 80s and 90s, we go into this amnesia that there are foreign corporate renters taking over, and now we're just dead in the water.
[15:34.000 --> 15:42.000]  Now, there's an awakening happening again, but it better happen quick because there's no debating what's happening.
[15:42.000 --> 15:49.000]  It's like if your boat's going through the shore, you're out there water skiing, and you say, hey, gee, dad, looks like you're about to run into the land.
[15:49.000 --> 15:54.000]  It's 100 yards away, but it turned the boat. No one goes, oh, who says we're going towards the land? There it is.
[15:54.000 --> 16:13.000]  We're going towards the rocks. Turn the wheel now. Turn it.

[19:13.000 --> 19:18.000]  You let the worst people get controlled and tell us that we are the ones responsible.
[19:18.000 --> 19:20.000]  Prime-directed discredit Alex Jones.
[19:20.000 --> 19:23.000]  Jones is the wildly popular conspiracy theory.
[19:23.000 --> 19:26.000]  A popular conspiracy theory talk show called InfoWars.
[19:26.000 --> 19:29.000]  Alex Jones is now in an Austin jail.
[19:29.000 --> 19:30.000]  These people are assaulting us.
[19:30.000 --> 19:33.000]  Targeting of patriots engaged.

[20:02.000 --> 20:06.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[20:14.000 --> 20:18.000]  Live from Austin, Texas. Broadcasting worldwide.
[20:18.000 --> 20:21.000]  It's Alex Jones.
[20:21.000 --> 20:25.000]  And we are locked and loaded to expose the globalist.
[20:25.000 --> 20:38.000]  So the Trans-Pacific Partnership was hatched and officially set up back in 1974.
[20:38.000 --> 20:43.000]  But Barry Goldwater, the senator had spoken about it and others had talked about it back in the 60s
[20:43.000 --> 20:50.000]  because it had been proposed to Congress to go along with signing up to world government
[20:50.000 --> 20:52.000]  a decade before.
[20:52.000 --> 20:58.000]  In fact, I've got a New York Times article that quotes John D. Rockefeller from 1937
[20:58.000 --> 21:00.000]  showing the 10 regions of the U.S.
[21:00.000 --> 21:05.000]  10 global regions that are then inside of three mega regions.
[21:05.000 --> 21:10.000]  The American Union that has the Caribbean in it.
[21:10.000 --> 21:12.000]  From Alaska to Chile.
[21:12.000 --> 21:17.000]  The European Union and the Asian Union.
[21:17.000 --> 21:25.000]  And then subgroups that are assigned within that like the Middle East, Africa and others.
[21:25.000 --> 21:28.000]  And this was pushed officially by U.S. colleges.
[21:28.000 --> 21:31.000]  They were trying to just do something open.
[21:31.000 --> 21:35.000]  That's why we could have a real debate about it in the 50s and 60s and 70s
[21:35.000 --> 21:37.000]  and have movements against it.
[21:37.000 --> 21:40.000]  Basically, everybody knew about it.
[21:40.000 --> 21:47.000]  And people like my dad's dad and my mom's dad, my grandfathers, my father in high school
[21:47.000 --> 21:54.000]  had a once a week radio show in Dallas speaking out when he was a teenager
[21:54.000 --> 21:59.000]  against the dangers of globalism, the dangers of this plan.
[21:59.000 --> 22:05.000]  I mean, America was mobilized against it.
[22:05.000 --> 22:10.000]  And then my dad went to school, went to medical school, had kids.
[22:10.000 --> 22:13.000]  Still happily married, just didn't really push it on me.
[22:13.000 --> 22:16.000]  I just, of course, followed his footsteps naturally
[22:16.000 --> 22:20.000]  because who wouldn't know about this and then fight it once they became a man?
[22:20.000 --> 22:21.000]  Who wouldn't?
[22:21.000 --> 22:24.000]  I mean, it's just, it's a default.
[22:24.000 --> 22:28.000]  Because we're not being conquered by some loving altruistic corporate government
[22:28.000 --> 22:32.000]  that's replacing some tyranny with some wonderful new freedom.
[22:32.000 --> 22:39.000]  The Asian Union, the American Union, and the EU all started as trade deals.
[22:39.000 --> 22:46.000]  And their secret, their draconian, their arbitrary, and all of it is now on display.
[22:46.000 --> 22:51.000]  Just as 22 years ago when they officially kicked off the EU, it really started in 57
[22:51.000 --> 22:55.000]  with the Treaty of Rome, a trade deal, England could not vote
[22:55.000 --> 22:58.000]  whether they wanted to be part of it or not.
[22:58.000 --> 23:12.000]  And they still, they still, to this day, we can't basically even find out what's in it.
[23:12.000 --> 23:14.000]  In fact, put that back on screen.
[23:14.000 --> 23:17.000]  I was getting distracted as they put an article on Scrazeray reading it.
[23:17.000 --> 23:22.000]  Obama warns TPP failure would let China write trade rules.
[23:22.000 --> 23:24.000]  See how globalism works?
[23:24.000 --> 23:27.000]  That's what Henry Kissinger came out along with Larry Summers about a month ago.
[23:27.000 --> 23:29.000]  They both wrote articles in op-eds.
[23:29.000 --> 23:32.000]  One for the New York Times and one for the Washington Post.
[23:32.000 --> 23:36.000]  They were republishing the Foreign Affairs, the Council on Foreign Relations publication.
[23:36.000 --> 23:41.000]  And they said, we're falling apart because we haven't embraced globalism enough.
[23:41.000 --> 23:44.000]  We've got to give up all our rights to these world bodies.
[23:44.000 --> 23:50.000]  Or this new global government will have all to say, and if we don't become part of it,
[23:50.000 --> 23:56.000]  we'll still be under it and have to take its edicts.
[23:56.000 --> 23:58.000]  See how that trick works?
[23:58.000 --> 24:04.000]  They create the global private corporate government, won't let the Congress see what's in it,
[24:04.000 --> 24:12.000]  and then say, we won't have any say on it unless we join with it when the elites in our own country
[24:12.000 --> 24:16.000]  set up the UN, set up the World Trade Organization,
[24:16.000 --> 24:22.000]  set up the different currency agreements that are in place today.
[24:22.000 --> 24:30.000]  But not to empower America, but to use America muscle and ingenuity to build this planetary government.
[24:30.000 --> 24:34.000]  But now, it's finally caught the public's imagination.
[24:34.000 --> 24:36.000]  It's finally caught their interest.
[24:36.000 --> 24:38.000]  Wait a minute.
[24:38.000 --> 24:42.000]  Until two months ago, even Congress, members of the House of the Senate,
[24:42.000 --> 24:52.000]  couldn't see the multi-thousand-page trans-specific partnership that's constantly being changed
[24:52.000 --> 25:03.000]  and altered in secret corporate slash governmental committees that meet in different countries every few months.
[25:03.000 --> 25:10.000]  And then now Congress has voted, the Senate has voted, to hand total authority over trade
[25:10.000 --> 25:13.000]  to the President to sign on to this agreement.
[25:13.000 --> 25:16.000]  Now, it's got to go by a House hurdle.
[25:16.000 --> 25:19.000]  But this is planetary government on parade.
[25:19.000 --> 25:24.000]  And remember, if you look at who's funding this, if you look at who's funding the moves to open our borders,
[25:24.000 --> 25:28.000]  the moves to go after our guns, the moves to federalize our health care,
[25:28.000 --> 25:32.000]  the moves to put our military under NATO command and Congress has told they have no authority,
[25:32.000 --> 25:35.000]  who's shutting off our power plants, who's getting rid of our jobs,
[25:35.000 --> 25:41.000]  who's putting regulations in to shut down our industry that China, India, Mexico, and 160 plus third world countries
[25:41.000 --> 25:45.000]  are exempt from, it is the TPP crowd.
[25:45.000 --> 25:52.000]  And it's a select robber bearing interest that want to put up basically trade barriers,
[25:52.000 --> 25:59.000]  tariffs, unofficial tariffs by putting regulations on our goods that are not equally on other goods
[25:59.000 --> 26:02.000]  and calling it free trade when it's the opposite.
[26:02.000 --> 26:04.000]  But that's only one part of it.
[26:04.000 --> 26:06.000]  The speech is attacked.
[26:06.000 --> 26:08.000]  Whistleblowers are attacked.
[26:08.000 --> 26:10.000]  The sovereignty is attacked.
[26:10.000 --> 26:16.000]  Currencies, everything, it's all in here.
[26:16.000 --> 26:22.000]  But on top of that, even major corporations are against it like Google.
[26:22.000 --> 26:24.000]  Here's the Leningradian headline.
[26:24.000 --> 26:29.000]  Hundreds of tech companies line up to oppose TPP trade agreement.
[26:29.000 --> 26:34.000]  Letters sign more than 250 companies, demands greater transparency, and says dangerously vague language
[26:34.000 --> 26:38.000]  would criminalize whistleblowers.
[26:38.000 --> 26:42.000]  The TPP would create an environment hostile to journalists and whistleblowers said policy directors
[26:42.000 --> 26:47.000]  of the Electronic Frontier Foundation and fight for the future co-authors of the letter.
[26:47.000 --> 26:52.000]  TPP's trade secret provisions could make it a crime for people to remove
[26:52.000 --> 26:57.000]  or reveal corporate wrongdoing through a computer system, says the letter.
[26:57.000 --> 27:01.000]  The language is dangerously vague and enables signatory countries to enact rules
[27:01.000 --> 27:06.000]  that would ban reporting on timely critical issues affecting the public.
[27:06.000 --> 27:13.000]  Among the signatories are activist sci-fi author, guardian tech columnist Cory Doctorow,
[27:13.000 --> 27:20.000]  quote, democracies make their laws in public, not in smoke-filled rooms, and it goes on from there.
[27:20.000 --> 27:26.000]  But understand, Congress is saying the president can sign whatever he wants.
[27:26.000 --> 27:32.000]  The U.S. Senate, the Republican leadership joining with Obama to trump sane Democrats
[27:32.000 --> 27:35.000]  and sane Republicans who are saying no.
[27:35.000 --> 27:39.000]  They combined forces to pass it in the Senate.
[27:39.000 --> 27:45.000]  It's a bigger battle in the House that looked for Boehner to try some trick or to attach it to a budget bill
[27:45.000 --> 27:48.000]  to ram this through.
[27:48.000 --> 27:51.000]  In the past, countries were conquered by armies.
[27:51.000 --> 27:56.000]  Seeing an army coming, as Cicero said in Rome, 2060 something years ago,
[27:56.000 --> 28:01.000]  he said that an enemy that comes with their banner openly flying is a lot easier to defeat
[28:01.000 --> 28:07.000]  than espionage and intrigue and manipulation and sub-refuge within.
[28:07.000 --> 28:10.000]  And these big corporations, folks, here's an example.
[28:10.000 --> 28:12.000]  General Electric is for it.
[28:12.000 --> 28:19.000]  General Electric also was given over 300 waivers on their power plants in the U.S. to burn coal
[28:19.000 --> 28:21.000]  when their competition wasn't.
[28:21.000 --> 28:23.000]  Their competition was shut down.
[28:23.000 --> 28:31.000]  General Electric, six years, upgrades, accelerates, increases power output, profits explode.
[28:31.000 --> 28:33.000]  That's what TPP is about.
[28:33.000 --> 28:40.000]  Arbitrary, secret, rapacious, picking winners and losers.
[28:40.000 --> 28:45.000]  So America is being conquered right now by secret global treaty.
[28:45.000 --> 28:50.000]  As the trilateral world government plan goes into overdrive,
[28:50.000 --> 28:54.000]  we're going to break more of this down straight ahead and talk about what life will be like
[28:54.000 --> 29:18.000]  under the TPP dictatorship.
[29:25.000 --> 29:42.000]  In response, Sanders has filed a lawsuit against Blinn College stating its policies and their enforcement are unconstitutional.
[29:42.000 --> 29:46.000]  This story is eerily similar to an incident at California Polytech earlier this year
[29:46.000 --> 29:51.000]  in which school officials were also requiring students who engage in First Amendment activities on campus
[29:51.000 --> 29:53.000]  to apply for a free speech permit.
[29:53.000 --> 29:57.000]  You can find more stories like these at infowars.com and prismplanet.com.
[29:57.000 --> 29:59.000]  Rob Dew reporting for Infowars Nightly News.
[29:59.000 --> 30:03.000]  I want more candy. I want more video games. Why, why, why?
[30:03.000 --> 30:09.000]  And it's that type of behavior that spurred me to do the research to develop a true nutraceutical formula
[30:09.000 --> 30:12.000]  that was designed to smooth out and help children focus.
[30:12.000 --> 30:15.000]  All of our children are hit with modern mind control.
[30:15.000 --> 30:19.000]  Television, music, fast food, GMOs, sugars, you name it.
[30:19.000 --> 30:25.000]  Young humans have not yet developed their nervous system and are being hammered daily by globalist concoctions.
[30:25.000 --> 30:30.000]  It's no wonder they can't focus and calm down and then are put on dangerous psychotropic drugs.
[30:30.000 --> 30:37.000]  Working with my team, we set out to find the best formula with the highest quality ingredients that children would actually like and take.
[30:37.000 --> 30:41.000]  We worked with the leading manufacturer and nutritional supplements that are safe for children
[30:41.000 --> 30:44.000]  to bring you the most affordable and powerful calming formula out there,
[30:44.000 --> 30:49.000]  introducing Child Ease with herbs and calming extracts like chamomile and lemon balm
[30:49.000 --> 30:52.000]  and essential nutrients that taste great.
[30:52.000 --> 30:55.000]  Obtain your Child Ease today at infowarslife.com.
[30:55.000 --> 30:59.000]  That's Child Ease exclusively at infowarslife.com.
[30:59.000 --> 31:04.000]  Using unparalleled research in the development of a synergistic formulation
[31:04.000 --> 31:09.000]  based around the key concepts of super oxygenation, the next level in cleansing is here
[31:09.000 --> 31:15.000]  with key ingredients backed by real clinical studies, the new oxy powder available through infowarslife
[31:15.000 --> 31:19.000]  was invented during Dr. Group's research on the toxification of our bodies.
[31:19.000 --> 31:25.000]  Many herbal colon cleansers are harsh on the body and contain cheap and potentially dangerous ingredients
[31:25.000 --> 31:29.000]  oftentimes full of synthetic fillers, GMOs, additives or worse.
[31:29.000 --> 31:34.000]  Gently start cleaning your body with easy capsules that start working while you sleep.
[31:34.000 --> 31:39.000]  Oxy powder does not require time off work and there's no need for bad taste and concoctions.
[31:39.000 --> 31:45.000]  Instead, oxy powder slowly releases monoatomic oxygen into the intestinal tract and body.
[31:45.000 --> 31:50.000]  Experience the astonishing cleansing power of superoxide and azanite technology.
[31:50.000 --> 31:56.000]  Go to infowarslife.com or infowarsstore.com to get started with oxy powder.
[31:56.000 --> 31:59.000]  Or call 1-888-253-3139.
[31:59.000 --> 32:04.000]  Introducing secret 12, the new infowarslife vitamin B12 formulation.
[32:04.000 --> 32:10.000]  Secret 12 is a binary of nutrimentical grade, bioavailable coenzyme forms of B12,
[32:10.000 --> 32:15.000]  methylcobalamin, the same kind used in B12 injections and adenosylcobalamin.
[32:15.000 --> 32:19.000]  Secret 12 is simply taken by mouth, right on the tongue and then swallowed.
[32:19.000 --> 32:21.000]  No needles, no injections.
[32:21.000 --> 32:25.000]  Secure your revolutionary secret 12 formula right now at infowarslife.com
[32:25.000 --> 32:29.000]  or call 888-253-3139.
[32:55.000 --> 32:59.000]  Go to infowarslife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[33:26.000 --> 33:29.000]  All right, let me settle down a little bit on this live Sunday broadcast
[33:29.000 --> 33:31.000]  and really try to break down the TPP.
[33:31.000 --> 33:38.000]  I'm going to go through what's known and what's been released by Congress about the secret treaty.
[33:38.000 --> 33:41.000]  But when you look at how the European Union operates,
[33:41.000 --> 33:44.000]  when you look at how the North American Union operates,
[33:44.000 --> 33:52.000]  and the fact that most Americans don't even know that there's been an NAU by treaty since 2005,
[33:52.000 --> 33:58.000]  when you look at how the subsets of the trilateral global plan works,
[33:58.000 --> 34:01.000]  you already know what's in the treaty.
[34:01.000 --> 34:04.000]  Absolute draconian oppression.
[34:04.000 --> 34:10.000]  And Senator Warren has claims that she's read much of the multi-thousand pages
[34:10.000 --> 34:13.000]  and says that it's very bad for America.
[34:13.000 --> 34:17.000]  Other members of Congress, like Senator Sessions, have looked at it.
[34:17.000 --> 34:20.000]  He says it's extremely bad as well.
[34:20.000 --> 34:26.000]  What I know is we shouldn't support anything that's secret
[34:26.000 --> 34:28.000]  and that transfers sovereignty overseas.
[34:28.000 --> 34:34.000]  And by the way, South Korea has the fastest growing economy in the world for multi-decades running,
[34:34.000 --> 34:38.000]  and they have refused to even be part of the talks.
[34:38.000 --> 34:45.000]  They're not stupid when China is basically quarterbacking the entire thing.
[34:45.000 --> 34:50.000]  And our elite has already sold out to the Communist generals basically
[34:50.000 --> 34:55.000]  to get sweetheart deals with factories in China to make billions of dollars per family.
[34:55.000 --> 34:58.000]  That's a big part of what's happened here as we've been sold out.
[34:58.000 --> 35:04.000]  But before we do that, I talked about the big multinational banks that are promoting TPP.
[35:04.000 --> 35:06.000]  Here's Bloomberg.
[35:06.000 --> 35:10.000]  Six banks, this came out of course Wednesday, pay 5.8 billion.
[35:10.000 --> 35:11.000]  Six banks.
[35:11.000 --> 35:14.000]  Five guilty of market rigging.
[35:14.000 --> 35:21.000]  JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, Barclays, Royal Bank of Scotland, and others agree
[35:21.000 --> 35:30.000]  to have the felony charges basically dropped by completing guilty to conspiring to manipulate the price of US dollars and euros globally.
[35:30.000 --> 35:35.000]  Some days making over 100 billion dollars.
[35:35.000 --> 35:40.000]  And so for years of doing this, they're going to pay 5.8 billion.
[35:40.000 --> 35:45.000]  Like robbing a million dollars and giving the police a $500 tip.
[35:45.000 --> 35:50.000]  That's even better than what were the companies a few years ago.
[35:50.000 --> 35:52.000]  Bloomberg reported on that as well.
[35:52.000 --> 35:56.000]  It was Wacovia and Wells Fargo pled guilty to laundering in a two-year period,
[35:56.000 --> 36:03.000]  $378 billion of narcotics money, and they paid a $111 million fine.
[36:03.000 --> 36:05.000]  That was HSBC2, right?
[36:05.000 --> 36:09.000]  HSBC has been involved in market rigging as well, yes.
[36:09.000 --> 36:11.000]  They all are.
[36:11.000 --> 36:15.000]  Interest rates are rigged, the stock market's rigged, it's all come out.
[36:15.000 --> 36:22.000]  And these are the people, these are the groups involved in the money laundering,
[36:22.000 --> 36:26.000]  involved in the bed rigging, involved in scamming everything,
[36:26.000 --> 36:37.000]  and creating $2.2 quadrillion in the last 20 years of fake money that they get to use
[36:37.000 --> 36:40.000]  to leverage and take over the world.
[36:40.000 --> 36:46.000]  $2,200 trillion is, I don't know, last time I saw some estimates are 80 times,
[36:46.000 --> 36:52.000]  120 times more wealth than there is in the world projected out for 100 years.
[36:52.000 --> 36:56.000]  I mean, these bankers have basically counterfeited so much money,
[36:56.000 --> 37:00.000]  and then now they're busy globally taking over small banks,
[37:00.000 --> 37:05.000]  taking over mom and pop operations, taking over credit unions.
[37:05.000 --> 37:07.000]  Let's be clear.
[37:07.000 --> 37:12.000]  When I criticize banks, I mean the big global five.
[37:12.000 --> 37:17.000]  They run the drugs, they own the aircraft, they've been caught running the sex slaves.
[37:17.000 --> 37:20.000]  They're involved in everything, and here's the deal.
[37:20.000 --> 37:25.000]  They're not just big evil boss hogs, they're the ones funding the anti-family movement.
[37:25.000 --> 37:27.000]  They're the ones demonizing manhood.
[37:27.000 --> 37:30.000]  They're the ones pushing to break up families.
[37:30.000 --> 37:34.000]  They're the ones pushing to force inoculate and fluoride in the water.
[37:34.000 --> 37:36.000]  They're the ones pushing for all the tyranny.
[37:36.000 --> 37:37.000]  They're creeps.
[37:37.000 --> 37:38.000]  They're scum.
[37:38.000 --> 37:42.000]  They're parasites.
[37:42.000 --> 37:46.000]  So six banks pay $5.8 billion, five guilty of market rigging Bloomberg.
[37:46.000 --> 37:48.000]  Here's another one.
[37:48.000 --> 37:49.000]  Well, this is USA Today.
[37:49.000 --> 37:55.000]  Five banks guilty of rigging rates pay more than $5 billion.
[37:55.000 --> 37:56.000]  Zero hedge.
[37:56.000 --> 38:00.000]  JP Morgan officially apologizes for being a criminal market manipulator.
[38:00.000 --> 38:04.000]  You know what's crazy is, I talked about this stuff 20 years ago.
[38:04.000 --> 38:06.000]  This has all been known forever before I was born.
[38:06.000 --> 38:08.000]  And people would call in and say, oh, it doesn't exist.
[38:08.000 --> 38:09.000]  You're crazy.
[38:09.000 --> 38:13.000]  Now it's all admitted and no one gets in trouble.
[38:13.000 --> 38:17.000]  Does that not creep everybody out?
[38:17.000 --> 38:24.000]  So now the Congress preliminarily in the House has passed.
[38:24.000 --> 38:27.000]  So the Senate now passed the final deal in the Senate.
[38:27.000 --> 38:32.000]  It's being sent to the House for final certification to make Obama, that's a whole other issue,
[38:32.000 --> 38:38.000]  a baby dictator to be able to decide any trade deal he wants and sign any agreement in secret
[38:38.000 --> 38:41.000]  and then keep the results secret.
[38:41.000 --> 38:44.000]  How Kafka asked is that?
[38:44.000 --> 38:48.000]  Kafka, what wrote the trial?
[38:48.000 --> 38:50.000]  I read that book when I was like 18 years old.
[38:50.000 --> 38:54.000]  I forget in half of it, but the guy's charged, but he won't be told the charge.
[38:54.000 --> 38:58.000]  And he's given a trial and never told what he did and then executed.
[38:58.000 --> 39:00.000]  That's why you call it Kafka asked.
[39:00.000 --> 39:03.000]  It's just, well, you can't see it and you can't see the law.
[39:03.000 --> 39:12.000]  It's like the IRS won't answer your phone calls on Obamacare and won't say what policy or law is.
[39:12.000 --> 39:14.000]  Talk to the hand.
[39:14.000 --> 39:21.000]  This is the new level of crazy town that we have reached in this country and this world.
[39:21.000 --> 39:26.000]  Because a whole bunch of other countries are signing on to this.
[39:26.000 --> 39:39.000]  TPP, let's go over a breakdown of the TPP from the congressional breakdown that has been released to the public.
[39:39.000 --> 39:43.000]  Let's go over what they say about it.
[39:43.000 --> 39:45.000]  Let's go over the history.
[39:45.000 --> 39:53.000]  In 2002, Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation meeting in Los Cabos, Mexico, they began the agreement in secret.
[39:53.000 --> 39:57.000]  So it's 14 years old.
[39:57.000 --> 40:01.000]  Trans-Pacific partnership, trilateral commission plan.
[40:01.000 --> 40:07.000]  The talk started with Pacific P4 in 2008 officially again in secret.
[40:07.000 --> 40:12.000]  They had 19 formal rounds of negotiations since then.
[40:12.000 --> 40:15.000]  All secret. All secret.
[40:15.000 --> 40:20.000]  All special deals and special interests in there with all these lawyers writing it.
[40:20.000 --> 40:30.000]  And it will transfer all U.S. trade representative systems to any country touching basically the Pacific Ocean, which is almost the entire planet.
[40:30.000 --> 40:34.000]  I mean, Africa technically goes into the Pacific.
[40:34.000 --> 40:41.000]  Russia, Japan, the United States, just basically everything.
[40:41.000 --> 40:46.000]  It continues. But again, under trilateral commission, the agreements have already been signed to transfer the power.
[40:46.000 --> 41:00.000]  Investor state arbitration, global taxation, where money goes, not allowing you to leave with money, getting rid of offshore trust for small groups, not for the elite.
[41:00.000 --> 41:02.000]  It's so in the planet up.
[41:02.000 --> 41:06.000]  Negotiation of secrecy and further treaties.
[41:06.000 --> 41:13.000]  Currency manipulation, tariffs are to be agreed to by now this foreign group, intellectual property.
[41:13.000 --> 41:25.000]  That's the big one that has the major tech company saying it's horrible because it ends free speech, ends any type of intellectual property except for the elite groups that are part of this.
[41:25.000 --> 41:27.000]  And it continues.
[41:27.000 --> 41:30.000]  Cost of medicine globally is decided.
[41:30.000 --> 41:33.000]  Income inequality, that means global taxation.
[41:33.000 --> 41:47.000]  Environment. They said they could directly, anything directly threatening our climate and our environment, including new rights that would be given to corporations and new constraints on fossil fuel industry all have a huge impact on our climate.
[41:47.000 --> 41:50.000]  These are quotes that they've released in the January 2014 meeting.
[41:50.000 --> 41:52.000]  So global carbon taxes.
[41:52.000 --> 41:54.000]  And it goes on from there.
[41:54.000 --> 41:57.000]  And the details are all secret.
[41:57.000 --> 41:58.000]  I'm going to say it again.
[41:58.000 --> 42:01.000]  Secret, secret, secret, secret.
[42:01.000 --> 42:13.000]  Private corporations, liaisoning with government and special interests, secretly creating global compacts that Congress, that creates the laws, signs its authority over to.
[42:13.000 --> 42:15.000]  What do you call that?
[42:15.000 --> 42:17.000]  You call that planetary government.
[42:17.000 --> 42:19.000]  And is it open planetary government?
[42:19.000 --> 42:21.000]  No, it's secret planetary government.
[42:21.000 --> 42:24.000]  And what have these groups pushed for in the past?
[42:24.000 --> 42:26.000]  Draconian restrictions on freedom.
[42:26.000 --> 42:33.000]  Movement, high taxes, regulations by every yardstick, totalitarian.
[42:33.000 --> 42:44.000]  So totalitarian world government and giving the mob boss Obama and the special interest and other special interests to come, other presidents to come.
[42:44.000 --> 42:59.000]  The power to pick winners and losers domestically because only the executive and a group of U.S. corporations will represent U.S. interest in future secret negotiations and disputes to stay with us.
[42:59.000 --> 43:01.000]  I want more candy.
[43:01.000 --> 43:02.000]  I want more video games.
[43:02.000 --> 43:03.000]  Why, why, why?
[43:03.000 --> 43:13.000]  And it's that type of behavior that spurred me to do the research to develop a true nutraceutical formula that was designed to smooth out and help children focus.
[43:13.000 --> 43:19.000]  All of our children are hit with modern mind control, television, music, fast food, GMOs, sugars, you name it.
[43:19.000 --> 43:25.000]  Young humans have not yet developed their nervous system and are being hammered daily by globalist concoctions.
[43:25.000 --> 43:30.000]  It's no wonder they can't focus and calm down and then are put on dangerous psychotropic drugs.
[43:30.000 --> 43:37.000]  Working with my team, we set out to find the best formula with the highest quality ingredients that children would actually like and take.
[43:37.000 --> 43:45.000]  We worked with the leading manufacturer in nutritional supplements that are safe for children to bring you the most affordable and powerful calming formula out there.

[47:17.000 --> 47:26.000]  Leading up frontal assault on the lives of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[47:26.000 --> 47:31.000]  Smoke on the water, fire in the sky.
[47:31.000 --> 47:36.000]  I'll be back, Lord willing, tomorrow, 11 a.m. Central with a weekday transmission.
[47:36.000 --> 47:40.000]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[47:40.000 --> 47:50.000]  Look, we're designed to take on a foreign army. We're designed to see people in another uniform coming after us in a straight-up stand-up fight.
[47:50.000 --> 47:56.000]  And that's not because other civilizations weren't sneaky. Other civilizations weren't underhanded.
[47:56.000 --> 48:00.000]  But it was seen, especially in the West, as unshivalrous.
[48:00.000 --> 48:06.000]  And so any population would turn against any occupier that did not fly their flag openly.
[48:06.000 --> 48:14.000]  In fact, you guys print me the Cicero quote on the Trader. Cicero, the Trader quote.
[48:14.000 --> 48:17.000]  And he does a whole speech. It's from a book he wrote.
[48:17.000 --> 48:28.000]  A member of the Roman Senate. I think the speech was given in something like 44 B.C.
[48:28.000 --> 48:35.000]  We're designed to fight an open enemy.
[48:35.000 --> 48:42.000]  In fact, there's the quote, a nation can survive its fools and even the ambitious, but it cannot survive treason from within.
[48:42.000 --> 48:47.000]  An enemy at the gates is less formidable, for he is known and carries his banner openly.
[48:47.000 --> 48:51.000]  But the Trader moves amongst those within the gate freely.
[48:51.000 --> 48:59.000]  His sly whispers rustle through all the alleyways, heard in the very halls of government itself, for the Trader appears not as a Trader.
[48:59.000 --> 49:06.000]  He speaks in accents familiar to his victims, and he wears the face and their arguments.
[49:06.000 --> 49:10.000]  He appeals to the baseness that lies deep within the hearts of all men.
[49:10.000 --> 49:17.000]  He rots the soul of a nation. He works secretly and unknown in the night to undermine the pillars of the city.
[49:17.000 --> 49:23.000]  He infects the body politic so that it can no longer resist. A murderer is less to fear.
[49:23.000 --> 49:29.000]  And I think of George Soros when I hear that quote. George Soros doesn't care about poor inner city people.
[49:29.000 --> 49:34.000]  He's a famous Nazi collaborator, currency speculator. It's a criminal.
[49:34.000 --> 49:37.000]  He's been convicted in multiple countries.
[49:37.000 --> 49:43.000]  He goes out and spends hundreds of millions of dollars to get race riots going on in their funding communist groups running around,
[49:43.000 --> 49:50.000]  calling for whacking the police, not to reform the government, but to destroy local government and destabilize.
[49:50.000 --> 49:57.000]  The Trader is the plague. They are the plague.
[49:57.000 --> 50:01.000]  What was the plague? The plague used to hit Rome every few decades.
[50:01.000 --> 50:07.000]  Coming out of the east, bubonic plague, eating your skin off. The Trader is the plague.
[50:07.000 --> 50:18.000]  Rotting the country. And that's what TPP is. And I'll say this, I like Ted Cruz.
[50:18.000 --> 50:22.000]  But you notice Ted Cruz voted for this.
[50:22.000 --> 50:30.000]  So did Senator Cornyn of Texas, both Texas Senators, Rand Paul did not.
[50:30.000 --> 50:32.000]  And that's why I say Rand Paul's better.
[50:32.000 --> 50:38.000]  Rand Paul says that if he sees the bill and that if it's true free trade, that we need to be part of a debate.
[50:38.000 --> 50:42.000]  We need to be part of any major group set up that he would vote to do it,
[50:42.000 --> 50:49.000]  but vote for the specific negotiation powers that the president would have at these meetings and that they shouldn't be secret
[50:49.000 --> 50:56.000]  and that they need to pass legislation that's been given to the president to implement.
[50:56.000 --> 50:59.000]  And they spend that and go, oh, see, he says he's still before it.
[50:59.000 --> 51:05.000]  No, he's playing politics with him. He's saying, let me see it.
[51:05.000 --> 51:08.000]  Because they will go after anybody that doesn't support this.
[51:08.000 --> 51:16.000]  That's why the Democratic and Republican leadership almost to a person went for this because this is global government.
[51:16.000 --> 51:20.000]  This is the big push. This is America being taken over.
[51:20.000 --> 51:23.000]  And by the way, understand something.
[51:23.000 --> 51:30.000]  If they get away with this, the sky's the limit.
[51:30.000 --> 51:35.000]  Just like I said with Obamacare or all these other executive power grabs.
[51:35.000 --> 51:40.000]  If they can get away with this, think of what they'll get away with next.
[51:40.000 --> 51:43.000]  Globalism does not create prosperity.
[51:43.000 --> 51:48.000]  Even if globalism was somewhat totalitarian, if it brought prosperity,
[51:48.000 --> 51:52.000]  I would criticize it because long term that always rots.
[51:52.000 --> 51:57.000]  And then even though sometimes totalitarianism can bring briefed prosperity down the road,
[51:57.000 --> 51:59.000]  it always takes a very bad turn.
[51:59.000 --> 52:07.000]  So I would be against it because I'm for free will and sovereignty and firewalls against unchecked power, separation of powers.
[52:07.000 --> 52:10.000]  But I wouldn't be fighting at tooth and nail.
[52:10.000 --> 52:12.000]  I wouldn't be as worried.
[52:12.000 --> 52:15.000]  We're in grave peril.
[52:15.000 --> 52:25.000]  Our elite are so arrogant that five years ago they began spending now $5 billion out of the U.S. alone.
[52:25.000 --> 52:31.000]  Millions more out of NATO, billions out of Saudi Arabia, probably a billion out of Turkey,
[52:31.000 --> 52:37.000]  to fund Jihad Muslim Brotherhood, Wahhabi, Asuni, al-Qaeda.
[52:37.000 --> 52:40.000]  I mean, they fly the al-Qaeda stinking flag.
[52:40.000 --> 52:43.000]  The military finally said, no, we're not going to be part of this.
[52:43.000 --> 52:44.000]  It made me cry.
[52:44.000 --> 52:48.000]  It was such a moment of finally seeing a soul left in our country.
[52:48.000 --> 52:52.000]  So they just changed the name to ISIS, had them invade Iraq, gave them a bunch of weapons caches.
[52:52.000 --> 52:55.000]  They've now turned back into Syria, they've taken back the area they lost.
[52:55.000 --> 52:57.000]  They've got over half the country now.
[52:57.000 --> 52:59.000]  Some estimates are two-thirds.
[52:59.000 --> 53:03.000]  And good people in our government have linked it.
[53:03.000 --> 53:04.000]  It's judicial watch.
[53:04.000 --> 53:09.000]  It's up on infowars.com.
[53:09.000 --> 53:16.000]  Secret Pentagon report reveals U.S. created, not the U.S., criminals that have hijacked the country.
[53:16.000 --> 53:19.000]  Just like TPP, they're going to say that's the U.S.
[53:19.000 --> 53:20.000]  No, it's not.
[53:20.000 --> 53:21.000]  It's secret.
[53:21.000 --> 53:27.000]  If you run me over with your car, I didn't help you run me over.
[53:27.000 --> 53:29.000]  So I want it to be clear.
[53:29.000 --> 53:31.000]  The majority of American people are not for this.
[53:31.000 --> 53:33.000]  The polls show that.
[53:33.000 --> 53:35.000]  We just have an occupied government.
[53:35.000 --> 53:38.000]  That's why, if you were the globalist, what would you be worried about?
[53:38.000 --> 53:41.000]  A peaceful revolution through the states to take the country back.
[53:41.000 --> 53:45.000]  That's why the whole system's set up to shut down states' rights.
[53:45.000 --> 53:48.000]  That's why they want to get riots going locally everywhere.
[53:48.000 --> 53:53.000]  For the feds to come in as the savior to save us from the local police.
[53:53.000 --> 53:54.000]  Give me a break.
[53:54.000 --> 53:58.000]  Local police, the least of our problems.
[53:58.000 --> 54:06.000]  Secret Pentagon report reveals U.S. created ISIS as the tool to overthrow Syria's President Assad.
[54:06.000 --> 54:10.000]  Judicial watch shows that Western governments deliberately ally with al-Qaeda.
[54:10.000 --> 54:15.000]  And other Islamist extremists groups to topple Syrian dictator Bashir Assad.
[54:15.000 --> 54:17.000]  By the way, people are going to say, Alex, we already know this.
[54:17.000 --> 54:21.000]  In fact, in the comments on info wars, they're like, Alex, we knew this five years ago.
[54:21.000 --> 54:22.000]  We've heard all the guests.
[54:22.000 --> 54:23.000]  It's well known.
[54:23.000 --> 54:26.000]  I mean, Assad's been saying, well, why is this news?
[54:26.000 --> 54:31.000]  Because the actual document has now been leaked to judicial watch.
[54:31.000 --> 54:35.000]  I respect it.
[54:35.000 --> 54:49.000]  And the president of Iraq has come out three times and said that criminal elements of our government are aiding al-Qaeda right now and ISIS's same group.
[54:49.000 --> 54:52.000]  And they're aiding them to get across the border and attack the U.S.
[54:52.000 --> 54:54.000]  And you're like, you mean they're real terrorists?
[54:54.000 --> 54:56.000]  Yes, they're real terrorists.
[54:56.000 --> 54:58.000]  Real in that the grassroots, they're real.
[54:58.000 --> 55:01.000]  Up the line, they're Western intelligence controlled.
[55:01.000 --> 55:04.000]  But beyond Western intelligence, 95% of the CIA.
[55:04.000 --> 55:06.000]  Is it involved in this?
[55:06.000 --> 55:08.000]  Probably 99.
[55:08.000 --> 55:14.000]  99% of the FBI, after 9-11, there were FBI agents in the news, including their deputy director who died on 9-11.
[55:14.000 --> 55:18.000]  He was in it a week before going, it's like al-Qaeda runs the FBI.
[55:18.000 --> 55:23.000]  We try to stop them and we're blocked because they do.
[55:23.000 --> 55:25.000]  It's not al-Qaeda running it.
[55:25.000 --> 55:28.000]  The people that run al-Qaeda are above the FBI.
[55:28.000 --> 55:31.000]  And now it's all coming out.
[55:31.000 --> 55:34.000]  This is coffin nails to the globalist.
[55:34.000 --> 55:36.000]  This is devastating.
[55:36.000 --> 55:39.000]  This is coming out.
[55:39.000 --> 55:44.000]  By the way, a conspiracy theorist are causing militants to abandon ISIS.
[55:44.000 --> 55:48.000]  Al-Qaeda has officially put out videos, ISIS, attacking in FullWars.com.
[55:48.000 --> 55:56.000]  And now they say that conspiracy theories claiming that don't join ISIS, they really work for the globalist, is causing them to not get new recruits.
[55:56.000 --> 56:01.000]  This is officially from the ISIS official website and videos.
[56:01.000 --> 56:04.000]  And of course, you know the tip of the spear of that is, infowars.com.
[56:04.000 --> 56:06.000]  But look, I don't want the credit.
[56:06.000 --> 56:07.000]  It's people in the military.
[56:07.000 --> 56:08.000]  It's the general public.
[56:08.000 --> 56:09.000]  It's judicial watch.
[56:09.000 --> 56:10.000]  It's Colonel Shaffer.
[56:10.000 --> 56:13.000]  It's countless others saying they won't be part of this.
[56:13.000 --> 56:25.000]  The point is, though, here we are again, here you are, the millions of listeners, putting this info out, affecting world change.
[56:25.000 --> 56:27.000]  So good job.
[56:27.000 --> 56:36.000]  We're going to start the next hour and open the phones up at 877-789-ALEX-877-789-2539.
[56:36.000 --> 56:40.000]  First-time callers, 877-789-2539 on the TPP.
[56:40.000 --> 56:42.000]  How big a deal is it?
[56:42.000 --> 56:43.000]  Will it be rammed through the house?
[56:43.000 --> 56:48.000]  We elected Republicans to get in there and reverse all this.
[56:48.000 --> 56:52.000]  And instead, all they've done is work with Obama to sell the country out.
[56:52.000 --> 56:56.000]  That shows you how rogue and out of control they are.
[56:56.000 --> 56:58.000]  Matt Drudge said the Republicans are committing suicide.
[56:58.000 --> 56:59.000]  I agree.
[56:59.000 --> 57:04.000]  But they're also killing America in a group suicide like Jim Jones while they do it.
[57:04.000 --> 57:08.000]  We'll talk about it all coming up in the second hour.
[57:08.000 --> 57:10.000]  877-789-ALEX.

[58:19.000 --> 58:21.000]  Alex Jones here.

[58:25.000 --> 58:30.000]  to design a nutraceutical formulation that has truly life changing health benefits.

[59:52.000 --> 59:55.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:08.000]  From his central Texas command center deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:12.000]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:17.000]  You know the mind moves too fast when it's making connections to even articulate it.
[01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:22.000]  But during that little 70 second break that we had between the hours,
[01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:28.000]  I was sitting back seeing how crystal clear the enemy's plan is and how it only stands.
[01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:36.000]  It only operates because the public is ignorant.
[01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:39.000]  The people perish for lack of knowledge.
[01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:44.000]  And I was seeing how they militarized police, how they put them in villainous Darth Vader outfits,
[01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:50.000]  how they then fund a lot of the militant protesters to make the police state look legitimate.
[01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:58.000]  And then one of the tiles on infowars.com was on screen of police in their Darth Vader outfits.
[01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:06.000]  And it just brought it home to me how sickening this whole plan is.
[01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:14.000]  And earlier this week, I guess on Thursday, they'd been up to more, no good yet again.
[01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:28.000]  I got to see the bottom of the barrel, miscreant, unspeakably weak, pathetic, truly wicked.
[01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:33.000]  I mean dog crap on the bottom of your shoes is godlike compared to these people.
[01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:37.000]  And I was just thinking about them running around in this free country,
[01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:42.000]  hanging up rotten pig heads, talking about how they're going to take out police.
[01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:48.000]  And then no wonder when they showed up in our protest to attack us, they wouldn't say who they were with.
[01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:53.000]  I just don't get it. I mean, I'm just so sick of people sneaking around.
[01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:55.000]  But see, they don't want to stand up fight, folks.
[01:01:55.000 --> 01:02:01.000]  They want to just roll around on the ground like little snakes.
[01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:04.000]  And I know one way I deal with snakes, that's all I know.
[01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:13.000]  And you see them ramping up to the summer of rage all over the world using the exacerbation of the public screwed over by the globalist.
[01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:18.000]  Legitimate anger of a corrupt global government, corrupt local governments, all of it,
[01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:26.000]  to then ignite a fake revolution to create a bunch of leftist squalor.
[01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:33.000]  And folks, in a communist country, you're lucky if you can get one type of detergent, one type of sausage, one type of bread,
[01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:37.000]  if it's even there, you'll have mold all over it, one type of tomatoes.
[01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:48.000]  You'll be lucky if you can get one watch every 10 years, one new pair of shoes every five years, one new pair of pants every year.
[01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:58.000]  And I got to watch all these spoiled, rotten people sitting here in all this wealth complaining, living better than the kings lived 100 years ago.
[01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:04.000]  Oh, don't worry, the globalists with their red carpets and their jumbo jets, they don't want you to live well anymore either.
[01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:07.000]  They're going to take everything you've got.
[01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:10.000]  And quite frankly, you deserve to be usurped if you buy into all this.
[01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:14.000]  And we do waste a lot of stuff, and we are decadent, but here's the difference.
[01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:24.000]  We're not premeditated evil like the globalists who want prosperity for them, but not for anybody else.
[01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:30.000]  We can have clean prosperity, we can have good technology, we can build a better world.
[01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:41.000]  But now they've sold a modern, dark age system where austerity and being poor is cool.
[01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:44.000]  But they're not giving you austerity to help the planet.
[01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:48.000]  They're giving you austerity to make you absolutely dependent on them.
[01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:51.000]  101 million people.
[01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:58.000]  The GAO, General Accounting Office came out, but on Thursday, 101 million and something.
[01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:00.000]  I forget the, maybe you guys can pull it up.
[01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:04.000]  Over 100 million people on food assistance.
[01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:06.000]  That a free country?
[01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:11.000]  Let me tell you, if you're responsible, if someone else is responsible for feeding you,
[01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:16.000]  and you're not a child, or you're not an 80-year-old person,
[01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:19.000]  because yeah, you're old, you took care of kids, and they're going to take care of you.
[01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:21.000]  Once a man, twice a child.
[01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:24.000]  You're not a slave if you're 80 years old and your kids are feeding you,
[01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:26.000]  though you are a slavery to them treating you right.
[01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:29.000]  You are dependent.
[01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:32.000]  But let me tell you, if you're 40 years old and you're dependent on the system,
[01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:36.000]  or you're 25 years old, you are a slave.
[01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:39.000]  I don't say that to make myself feel good about you.
[01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:42.000]  I'm a couple steps out of the same place you're at.
[01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:46.000]  I say that going, listen, this isn't a good place to be.
[01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:50.000]  It's not like these slave masters want you to live in Valhalla Cupcake.
[01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:52.000]  They want you to live in Hades.
[01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:54.000]  That's the difference.
[01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:56.000]  They got bad will towards you and your family.
[01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:59.000]  Your calls are coming up.
[01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:04.000]  In case you missed it yesterday, the hashtag Black Lives Matter protest
[01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:07.000]  was interrupted by members of Red Guards Austin,
[01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:12.000]  a political organization that admits they are a Marxist, Leninist, Maoist collective.
[01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:16.000]  These guardians of the people attempted to block other people's free speech,
[01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:20.000]  yelled at them, and then even started to agitate by bumping into people,
[01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:24.000]  pushing people around, and even stealing and breaking some of our broadcast equipment.
[01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:28.000]  Luckily it was all caught on camera, and we were able to explain to the cops what happened.
[01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:31.000]  If you go to the Red Guards Austin Facebook page,
[01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:34.000]  you can see pictures of some of these individuals who showed up yesterday.
[01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:38.000]  During the live broadcast, we were able to show Facebook images of these individuals
[01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:41.000]  carrying communist sickles, burning American flags,
[01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:45.000]  and basically trying to get everybody into a race war against the police.
[01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:47.000]  Of course, they were there dressed in all black, saying,
[01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:50.000]  we're here for women's health, but then even on tape,
[01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:53.000]  they talked about how they love to kill babies.
[01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:55.000]  Check out our YouTube videos on the Alex Jones channel
[01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:59.000]  and the articles on Infowars.com, Rob Dew reporting for Infowars.com.
[01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:30.000]  Derrick in Wyoming, Frank in New York, Emily in Illinois,
[01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:34.000]  Saul in New York, Antoine in California, and others.
[01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:37.000]  Your phone calls are coming up right now.
[01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:42.000]  Then Joe Biggs is in Cleveland where they had the verdict on the police officer
[01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:45.000]  and the reported slaying of two unarmed black males.
[01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:48.000]  Another tragedy, they have said no to manslaughter charges.
[01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:51.000]  There were 71 arrests last night.
[01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:57.000]  The George Soros crowd has been busing in agitators from all over the surrounding area.
[01:06:57.000 --> 01:07:02.000]  The good news is they have not successfully ignited any real rioting.
[01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:04.000]  So that is coming up.
[01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:07.000]  Ladies and gentlemen with Joe Biggs, he'll be joining us.
[01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:13.000]  Then we'll continue with your calls and get into all these other news articles.
[01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:17.000]  We're going to break down open carry bill passes in Texas.
[01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:21.000]  We're going to look at some of the workers in Japan working to death.
[01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:25.000]  Putin acts law banning undesirable NGOs.
[01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:30.000]  FBI admits no major case is cracked with Patriot Act snooping powers.
[01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:37.000]  City orders Al Sharpton's daughter to save incriminating hiking pics of her mountain climbing
[01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:43.000]  in different parts of the world and posting on her Facebook and Twitter when she did it.
[01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:51.000]  She did it after she filed a suit against the city of New York wanting money for a pothole.
[01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:56.000]  She says hurt her knee so that she can't walk anymore.
[01:07:56.000 --> 01:08:03.000]  I love her dad who owes like $3 million in taxes and is above the law and they live in big penthouses
[01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:07.000]  and have all this money and then she's trying to sue to get money for her knee.
[01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:13.000]  I mean another ambulance chasing parasite, truly sickening.
[01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:21.000]  Hey, if I step in a pothole, I'm not going to sue the city over it because I was the person not looking where I was walking.
[01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:30.000]  And by the way, I did step in a big pothole at the state park in Big Bend, Texas and tore my Achilles
[01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:36.000]  and I probably could have sued them for it and I didn't because I was the person walking around at night out there.
[01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:42.000]  And the folks I was with said don't walk across there, you might break your ankle and sure enough I almost did.
[01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:50.000]  Oh, I'm going to sue the state of Texas now. I mean it is just crazy.
[01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:53.000]  But what do you expect? We've created a parasitic system.
[01:08:53.000 --> 01:09:03.000]  I've got a stack of articles where the DEA has robbed thousands of people on trains with the federal agency of the TSA.
[01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:06.000]  If they find $1,000, $5,000, remember they just take it.
[01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:13.000]  So see it's just the government's full of crooks, the public are a bunch of crooks. It's just scary.
[01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:18.000]  Good people have to organize and protect ourselves from these people.
[01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:22.000]  Right now, who should I go to first? Who's been holding the longest here?
[01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:28.000]  Frank in New York City, go ahead or New York State, I don't know. Go ahead Frank.
[01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:30.000]  Alex, how are you? How are you doing?
[01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:32.000]  Good brother, thanks for calling.
[01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:35.000]  Thank you. You know what gets me really frustrated?
[01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:40.000]  I've been informed with the TPP for about a couple of years now and it's so frustrating.
[01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:45.000]  I'm telling all my co-workers, I tell people from the outside this is what they're trying to do.
[01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:50.000]  They're trying to destroy your sovereignty, take your rights away, control your life and they don't listen.
[01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:52.000]  It's just so damn frustrating.
[01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:58.000]  No it is, it is because they hear TPP. I mean if they heard it was guys in black uniforms they'd be concerned.
[01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:02.000]  They'd hear, oh corporation, because they don't respect themselves, they've given up.
[01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:05.000]  They say, what does it matter if there's some global deal?
[01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:14.000]  They've never experienced this type of assault, just like a dodo bird had never been around humans or prey animals.
[01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:18.000]  As prey animals, they'd never been around predator animals.
[01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:24.000]  And so within a few years all the birds have been chicken fried and that's what happened.
[01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:31.000]  And so the general public here has had it good so long that they don't understand how they're being usurped Frank.
[01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:35.000]  You know what gives me angry to the lion community? I'm actually lying to myself.
[01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:40.000]  And basically you know you can tell these people every day and they will not listen to you.
[01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:44.000]  It's just so frustrating, it gets me angry. It really does.
[01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:49.000]  I mean don't you understand they're taking your damn rights away? Don't you understand?
[01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:52.000]  Wake up people, let's go, wake up.
[01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:56.000]  Where is their instinct? I mean I gotta be honest.
[01:10:56.000 --> 01:11:04.000]  Of all the groups out there, I wouldn't say that the Latin community is the most servile.
[01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:10.000]  I'd probably have to say that'd be white people, but certainly where is the instinct to not want to be enslaved
[01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:15.000]  and not be dominated and not be overtaken and not be preyed upon?
[01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:18.000]  It is simply incredible. God bless you, I appreciate your call.
[01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:24.000]  But look at the black community. The black community has been trained to only obsess over,
[01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:31.000]  let's say a city like Austin, Texas, one or two black men shot suspiciously a year by cops.
[01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:36.000]  Are there some bad cops? Absolutely. Are there some folks who didn't have badges? Yeah.
[01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:41.000]  Are there some problems? You bet. Use it the whole thing in the world.
[01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:46.000]  No, doubling black unemployment under Obama. Never hear about it from NAACP.
[01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:52.000]  17 million aborted blacks under Roe v. Wade. Never hear about it.
[01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:59.000]  Gangster culture destroying the black community. You'll never, because it's easy because the Democrats
[01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:05.000]  and George Soros make every problem in the world about the cops.
[01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:11.000]  And once you've done that, why everybody can feel good about themselves and just keep sinking into quicksand.
[01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:17.000]  It's unbelievable. Let's talk to Emily in Illinois, then Derek, you're on the air.
[01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:22.000]  Hi, Alex. Welcome. I know, I can hardly believe I'm on the phone with you.
[01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:27.000]  Okay, I was on the phone with you before when Hillary first started and I said,
[01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:33.000]  hi, help, help, help, help, or whatever you said, she was like, this whole thing is...
[01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:35.000]  I think I said, Hal Hillary, yes.
[01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:41.000]  He was like, this is becoming so ridiculous. I had a dream that my brother in law who was in politics
[01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:43.000]  who died from cancer was protecting us.
[01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:46.000]  Well, ma'am, I got to jump because it's first-time callers and I'm not trying to be mean,
[01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:51.000]  but I said first-time callers, that's what I meant. Derek and Wyoming, you're on the air. Go ahead.
[01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:56.000]  Hey, Alex, thanks for what you do. Thanks for what you do. Thanks that you're loud out there.
[01:12:56.000 --> 01:12:59.000]  Please don't thank me, brother. Go ahead.
[01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:05.000]  All right. I live in Wyoming and we have a governor that just loves asset forfeiture seizure
[01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:11.000]  and a city council in Laramie, Wyoming, which is given into the gay mafia and even Casper is looking at it.
[01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:17.000]  So we're pretty much occupied at the state level. Local government is where it is in jury notification.
[01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:24.000]  I am a listener and a prison planet TV member, product user, and we just got to get out locally.
[01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:28.000]  And if you want to wake someone up in their 60s or 70s, introduce them to Paul Craig Roberts.
[01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:31.000]  There's a lot of things we can do to get creative.
[01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:38.000]  Absolutely. The most important thing you can do is pass on information to friends and family.
[01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:44.000]  The most important thing you can do is just continue to push and promote media that's telling the truth.
[01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:50.000]  I mean, we're very close to beating the globalist. It's taken them years to try to pass the TPP through the Senate.
[01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:53.000]  They finally got it. Now it's got to clear the house.
[01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:58.000]  And their argument is we won't get a say in this global government if we don't join with it.
[01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:02.000]  Well, good. Let it operate on its own. We don't need to be part of it.
[01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:07.000]  NAFTA and GATT, the rest of this have not been good for us.
[01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:13.000]  Good. I agree with you. Another thing I appreciate about you is there's no raffle. You won't go down.
[01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:19.000]  And you know, there's people talk about the Illuminati, this, that, and the other, all these organizations.
[01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:28.000]  The Jesuits, that oath that was recorded in the Library of Congress in 1883, is a specific, basically, future terrorism.
[01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:33.000]  I mean, I grew up Catholic, but I got saved four years ago, and that's not a bash on Catholics.
[01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:38.000]  We need to quit being so sensitive if we got evil within, in somewhere, a group that we're in.
[01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:42.000]  We need to expose it, like the Pope lecturing on global warming.
[01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:53.000]  I hear you. This new Pope is very Marxist and is providing global carbon taxes and merging religions, and it's pretty scary.
[01:14:53.000 --> 01:15:01.000]  And a lot of Catholics are upset. I know that I'm not a Catholic, but I'm just upset watching this political, it turning into a political system.
[01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:05.000]  We got to go to break. We're going to talk to Joe Biggs when we come back.
[01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:13.000]  And then after that segment, Sal in New York, Dan in Las Vegas, Antoine in California, and many, many others.
[01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:24.000]  But speaking of asset forfeiture seizure, this is something Republicans tend to support, just like they're supporting so-called free trade.
[01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:31.000]  And it's horrible. Democrats support it somewhat as well, but not as much.
[01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:39.000]  Asset forfeiture seizure is outside the Constitution, and it allows them to take people's property when it's not been adjudicated.
[01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:43.000]  They've not been proven to commit a crime, and it's completely out of control.
[01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:49.000]  It's unpopular. It's unconstitutional, and it needs to be removed right now.
[01:15:49.000 --> 01:16:03.000]  I'm Alex Jones. You're listening to the Alex Jones Sunday edition. We're live, broadcasting worldwide, infowars.com.
[01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:20.000]  And it's that type of behavior that spurred me to do the research to develop a true nutraceutical formula that was designed to smooth out and help children focus.
[01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:25.000]  Young humans have not yet developed their nervous system and are being hammered daily by globalist concoctions.
[01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:30.000]  It's no wonder they can't focus and calm down and then are put on dangerous psychotropic drugs.
[01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:37.000]  Working with my team, we set out to find the best formula with the highest quality ingredients that children would actually like and take.
[01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:44.000]  We worked with the leading manufacturer in nutritional supplements that are safe for children to bring you the most affordable and powerful calming formula out there.
[01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:52.000]  Introducing Child Ease with herbs and calming extracts like chamomile and lemon balm and essential nutrients that taste great.

[01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:13.000]  Security, alert. This is Homeland Security. Analysis, info wars, building independent media operations.
[01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:18.000]  You let the worst people get controlled and tell us that we are the ones responsible.
[01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:21.000]  Prime Directive, discredit Alex Jones.
[01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:24.000]  Jones is the wildly popular conspiracy theory.
[01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:27.000]  A popular conspiracy theory talk show called Info Wars.
[01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:29.000]  Alex Jones is now in an Austin jail.
[01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:31.000]  These people are assaulting us.
[01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:33.000]  Targeting of patriots engaged.
[01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:40.000]  They are never going to stop. They're never going to deviate from their program until we stop them.

[01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:37.000]  Harvested around the planet and then concentrated.
[01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:39.000]  Or maximum potency.
[01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:42.000]  They want to stun and dumb down and energy drinks and stuff.
[01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:45.000]  Just cover that up for a while, but then burn you out in my experience.
[01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:49.000]  Whereas stuff that gets your glands naturally going goes right to the source.
[01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:51.000]  So it's pretty exciting and I love it.

[01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:25.000]  You are listening to an InfoWars.com frontline report.
[01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:35.000]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:36.000]  Welcome back.
[01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:44.000]  Joe Biggs has been covering the Soros-funded police, anti-police demonstrations around the country
[01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:50.000]  that are dealing with legitimate police brutality, legitimate out of control behavior in some cases.
[01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:54.000]  In some cases not, like the Brown case and others.
[01:20:54.000 --> 01:20:58.000]  But regardless, the federal government wants to federalize police.
[01:20:58.000 --> 01:21:00.000]  Al Sharpton has admitted that.
[01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:02.000]  That's what they're trying to do.
[01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:04.000]  That's why they're stirring this up.
[01:21:04.000 --> 01:21:09.000]  Because it diverts from all the really big things that are happening.
[01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:15.000]  But before we go there, Associated Press and Fox Six all reported
[01:21:15.000 --> 01:21:23.000]  a confidential informant said a week ago, and of course it was a week ago today,
[01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:27.000]  that there's going to be a response by the Banditos Motorcycle Gang,
[01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:31.000]  one of the largest one percent in the world after the Hell's Angels,
[01:21:31.000 --> 01:21:36.000]  a Texas-based group with the Black Widows,
[01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:39.000]  and that the Black Widows are coming to Texas to kill police.
[01:21:39.000 --> 01:21:45.000]  And I've got the quotes up on screen if you're watching Biker Gang shooting update,
[01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:48.000]  law enforcement on high state of alert.
[01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:51.000]  And when I was reading this, it said,
[01:21:51.000 --> 01:21:58.000]  members of the Biker Gang who are in the military are supposedly supplying the gang with grenades and C-4 explosives.
[01:21:58.000 --> 01:22:00.000]  They love that to demonize the military.
[01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:05.000]  However, the bulletin is based on unsubstantiated information from an informant
[01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:11.000]  who claimed to have obtained it from Banditos and Black Widows Motorcycle Gang members.
[01:22:11.000 --> 01:22:17.000]  Now, when I read this on Friday, after I got off here, I went and looked it up.
[01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:21.000]  And I went, didn't they make like four Clint Eastwood movies that my dad would take me to
[01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:27.000]  when I was a little kid back in the 70s where he was boxing some bad guy
[01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:30.000]  but separately these crazy Black Widows guys were after him.
[01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:37.000]  So I went and searched, and sure enough, there is no Motorcycle Gang known of anywhere called the Black Widows,
[01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:43.000]  especially since they made this movie where they're the biggest morons on the planet.
[01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:47.000]  They're like Nazi Barney Fife's or something.
[01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:53.000]  So this narrative that Joe Biggs, combat veteran says that he smelled a rat a week ago,
[01:22:53.000 --> 01:23:00.000]  we now know the bikers were shot by snipers between the eyes, right in the forehead and in the chest.
[01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:05.000]  If you're in a gunfight, even a great sniper isn't going to hit everybody perfectly.
[01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:09.000]  So I'm just being honest, this looks like a setup like we're not getting the truth.
[01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:13.000]  Like somebody did something, a fight started, maybe somebody shot,
[01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:17.000]  but then the cops were there and just executed people, and then they call that a biker massacre.
[01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:23.000]  A biker massacre that does not make, to quote Yoda.
[01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:28.000]  A biker massacre it is not.
[01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:30.000]  I sense the sith.
[01:23:30.000 --> 01:23:32.000]  So now we've really combined everything.
[01:23:32.000 --> 01:23:38.000]  We've combined Filo, Beto, Every Which Way But Loose, The Black Widows, and Yoda,
[01:23:38.000 --> 01:23:41.000]  plus infowars.com and Staff Sergeant Joe Biggs.
[01:23:41.000 --> 01:23:43.000]  You have quite a party there.
[01:23:43.000 --> 01:23:47.000]  Let's play a clip from one of the movies where they're meeting back at the clubhouse saying,
[01:23:47.000 --> 01:23:49.000]  we are the Black Widows, here it is.
[01:23:49.000 --> 01:24:17.000]  We are the Black Widows.
[01:24:17.000 --> 01:24:25.000]  Good grief, I'm proud to burn them.
[01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:27.000]  Guess what?
[01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:34.000]  They can brownies.
[01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:37.000]  They can't even cook brownies.
[01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:40.000]  Why me, Lord?
[01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:44.000]  I mean, you make other men out of clay.
[01:24:44.000 --> 01:24:48.000]  I've cut it off, cut it off.
[01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:51.000]  You make out of Hillary Clinton.
[01:24:51.000 --> 01:24:53.000]  What do you make, Joe Biggs?
[01:24:53.000 --> 01:24:58.000]  You've been questioning this day one, and now a lot of this is coming out that the official story where they're saying,
[01:24:58.000 --> 01:25:00.000]  don't ride motorcycles on I-35.
[01:25:00.000 --> 01:25:02.000]  We may sniper you.
[01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:08.000]  I mean, you got the communists running around in all 50 states chanting, say, kill cops.
[01:25:08.000 --> 01:25:11.000]  In Ferguson, George Soros funded, and that's okay.
[01:25:11.000 --> 01:25:14.000]  But then they're just claiming motorcycle gangs.
[01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:16.000]  99% of them are patriots.
[01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:19.000]  In fact, most of them are libertarians and veterans.
[01:25:19.000 --> 01:25:23.000]  Now they claim veterans are supplying the Black Widows with plastic explosives.
[01:25:23.000 --> 01:25:26.000]  There is no Black Widows from what I know, Joe.
[01:25:26.000 --> 01:25:32.000]  Yeah, I mean, the fact that they think that anybody who's in the military has access to an armory
[01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:38.000]  and has the capability to get in there and pull that kind of hardware out is beyond me.
[01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:45.000]  I mean, you have to go through so much paperwork and through different ranking people to be able to even get in there,
[01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:49.000]  let alone get a gun out or some rounds, even go to a shooting range.
[01:25:49.000 --> 01:25:51.000]  Yeah, you were telling me a lot of times, and it was in Rolling Stone,
[01:25:51.000 --> 01:25:54.000]  an article that you need plastic to blow up a weapons cache.
[01:25:54.000 --> 01:25:58.000]  They wouldn't give it to you, so you just use 50 calibers to blow it up.
[01:25:58.000 --> 01:26:00.000]  Yeah, I mean, it's hard to get stuff like that.
[01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:04.000]  So the fact that they're saying these veterans are getting them and bringing them out,
[01:26:04.000 --> 01:26:06.000]  that's another far-fetched part of the story.
[01:26:06.000 --> 01:26:11.000]  And like I said, if there's a shootout going on, if you're sitting inside and you're having lunch
[01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:14.000]  and all of a sudden you hear gunfire, you don't know where that gunfire is coming from.
[01:26:14.000 --> 01:26:17.000]  You're pulling your gun out and you're just kind of shooting in a direction.
[01:26:17.000 --> 01:26:21.000]  So those shots that people would have been hit by would have been sporadic
[01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:26.000]  and the shoulders, neck, head, mouth, ears, back, side, wherever.
[01:26:26.000 --> 01:26:30.000]  And the fact that they were center mass here and in the chest,
[01:26:30.000 --> 01:26:38.000]  I mean, it makes it very odd to think that this was this, you know, gunfight at the OK Corral.
[01:26:38.000 --> 01:26:43.000]  Well, that's now all come out, but now they're claiming an imaginary motorcycle team
[01:26:43.000 --> 01:26:50.000]  last defeated by a movie actor in 1980 is behind this.
[01:26:50.000 --> 01:26:56.000]  I mean, why would the police, the feds come out and say that the Black Widows are about to attack?
[01:26:56.000 --> 01:27:01.000]  Well, they had to create Coruscant, remember, and ISIS.
[01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:05.000]  They had to create those bad guys so at the end of the day they could go after what it is that they really wanted
[01:27:05.000 --> 01:27:07.000]  to take our liberties away.
[01:27:07.000 --> 01:27:12.000]  So it doesn't, I don't put a pass and they come up with a fake motorcycle club to try and, you know,
[01:27:12.000 --> 01:27:14.000]  attack people's liberties.
[01:27:14.000 --> 01:27:17.000]  But why didn't they say the goblins or something?
[01:27:17.000 --> 01:27:20.000]  Why pick a famous fake group?
[01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:22.000]  I don't know. It's beyond me.
[01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:25.000]  I mean, what these guys are doing nowadays is just beyond me at this point.
[01:27:25.000 --> 01:27:31.000]  I mean, every day that I look at the news, I'm just completely just in shock and awe of the fact
[01:27:31.000 --> 01:27:36.000]  that the Blake lies and crap that they put out and think that people are just going to eat it
[01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:39.000]  and think that we're not going to see it and not call them out on it.
[01:27:39.000 --> 01:27:41.000]  All right, I want to come back in the next segment before I go to calls.
[01:27:41.000 --> 01:27:45.000]  Just briefly talk about Cleveland, what you saw last night, what you saw today, the verdict,
[01:27:45.000 --> 01:27:47.000]  your take on the situation.
[01:27:47.000 --> 01:27:49.000]  Joe Bicks spent a few days there waiting for the verdict.
[01:27:49.000 --> 01:27:50.000]  They didn't have it.
[01:27:50.000 --> 01:27:53.000]  He left, came back after the verdict was announced yesterday.
[01:27:53.000 --> 01:27:55.000]  He's in Cleveland right now.
[01:27:55.000 --> 01:28:02.000]  But have you seen on infowars.com judicial watch came out with the secret defense intelligence report
[01:28:02.000 --> 01:28:09.000]  where they admit our government is funding Al Qaeda and creating an ISIS caliphate group
[01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:11.000]  and is behind the radicals.
[01:28:11.000 --> 01:28:13.000]  I mean, we already knew this, but now it's admitted.
[01:28:13.000 --> 01:28:14.000]  How big is that?
[01:28:14.000 --> 01:28:16.000]  I mean, that's extremely huge.
[01:28:16.000 --> 01:28:21.000]  I mean, that that further proves and justifies everything that we've been saying since day one
[01:28:21.000 --> 01:28:23.000]  about a year ago when this entire thing broke out.
[01:28:23.000 --> 01:28:28.000]  When we said that they were going to use ISIS to essentially try to take down the Assad regime.
[01:28:28.000 --> 01:28:36.000]  I mean, I'm glad that they're finally doing their job that mainstream people are actually doing something worth, you know, a damn as journalists.
[01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:40.000]  Now, I do see some female acrobat right there in the background.
[01:28:40.000 --> 01:28:42.000]  That is, I see some fellows doing their job there.
[01:28:42.000 --> 01:28:44.000]  That is very good, Joe.
[01:28:44.000 --> 01:28:46.000]  It's breaking.
[01:28:46.000 --> 01:28:51.000]  Hold on, stay there. We have video feeds at infowars.com forward slash shows.
[01:28:51.000 --> 01:28:54.000]  He looks like he's outside an NBA basketball game.

[01:28:56.000 --> 01:29:18.000]  Stay with us.
[01:29:26.000 --> 01:29:31.000]  We're going to find out exactly what's happening right now.

[01:30:27.000 --> 01:30:30.000]  Alex Jones here.
[01:30:30.000 --> 01:30:39.000]  For the last two years, I've been working with top doctors, nutritionist and chemist to design a nutraceutical formulation that has truly life changing health benefits.

[01:31:59.000 --> 01:32:02.000]  I love our candy. I will never forget it. Why, why, why?
[01:32:02.000 --> 01:32:12.000]  And it's that type of behavior that spurred me to do the research to develop a true nutraceutical formula that was designed to smooth out and help children focus.
[01:32:12.000 --> 01:32:15.000]  All of our children are hit with modern mind control.
[01:32:15.000 --> 01:32:25.000]  Television, music, fast food, GMOs, sugars, you name it, young humans have not yet developed their nervous system and are being hammered daily by globalist concoctions.
[01:32:25.000 --> 01:32:30.000]  It's no wonder they can't focus and calm down and then are put on dangerous psychotropic drugs.
[01:32:30.000 --> 01:32:36.000]  Working with my team, we set out to find the best formula with the highest quality ingredients that children would actually like and take.
[01:32:36.000 --> 01:32:44.000]  We worked with the leading manufacturer in nutritional supplements that are safe for children to bring you the most affordable and powerful calming formula out there.
[01:32:44.000 --> 01:32:51.000]  Introducing Child Ease with herbs and calming extracts like chamomile and lemon balm and essential nutrients that taste great.

[01:33:21.000 --> 01:33:27.000]  Waging War on Corruption. It's Alex Jones.
[01:33:27.000 --> 01:33:34.000]  Joe Biggs, Infowars.com reporter is doing a solo job up there in Cleveland.
[01:33:34.000 --> 01:33:41.000]  They had the verdict yesterday on this police officer that shot two unarmed black males.
[01:33:41.000 --> 01:33:47.000]  And I see in the background, it looks like professional sports, basketball is about to go on, there's a whole bunch of acrobats.
[01:33:47.000 --> 01:33:57.000]  First off, Joe, for TV viewers, tell us where you are, what we're witnessing as you double as reporter and cameraman doing a great job, and then give us your take on the verdict.
[01:33:57.000 --> 01:34:07.000]  Well, right now we are downtown at the Quicken Loans Arena. Tonight, the Cleveland Cavaliers will have their first home game against the Atlanta Hawks.
[01:34:07.000 --> 01:34:17.000]  So earlier today, the Cleveland Indians baseball team beat the Cincinnati Reds, so there are thousands and thousands and thousands of people downtown right now.
[01:34:17.000 --> 01:34:21.000]  I'm just kind of pulled back away from the main crowd where everybody is.
[01:34:21.000 --> 01:34:27.000]  So yesterday, 9.30 in the morning, I got up because my phone was going off saying that the verdict was about to be read.
[01:34:27.000 --> 01:34:42.000]  And to my shock, you know, the shock of my ears and my eyes, I saw the judge come out and say that Officer Michael Brillo was completely justified in jumping on the hood of a car and firing 15 times.
[01:34:42.000 --> 01:34:50.000]  And what he said was the reason they think it's justified because they can't really prove how many rounds came from his gun that were fatal.
[01:34:50.000 --> 01:34:55.000]  They know that one for sure was a fatal round in that.
[01:34:55.000 --> 01:34:57.000]  And what was his excuse to be shooting at him?
[01:34:57.000 --> 01:35:08.000]  He said the reason that he was shooting at him, Alex, is because they had just finished the car chase and he had run his vehicle right towards the side of the vehicle to try to pin it in.
[01:35:08.000 --> 01:35:13.000]  And I guess their vehicle started to move. So he got out of the vehicle and he was standing in front of it.
[01:35:13.000 --> 01:35:19.000]  So he got scared that they were going to run and hit him at full speed and pin his legs into his own squad car.
[01:35:19.000 --> 01:35:25.000]  So he jumped up on the hood of his car and then he jumped over onto the hood of the assailants car and began to shoot off those rounds.
[01:35:25.000 --> 01:35:28.000]  And he even had time to reload and continue shooting.
[01:35:28.000 --> 01:35:30.000]  Yeah, sounds like he went crazed.
[01:35:30.000 --> 01:35:36.000]  Well, I don't think he should be a cop. I've read that similar story. It just sounds like a hothead.
[01:35:36.000 --> 01:35:41.000]  But at the same time, it's not a reason to have race riots all over the country. A true tragedy.
[01:35:41.000 --> 01:35:49.000]  Closing comments on this, we saw 71 arrests last night. What are you expecting to see this evening, Joe Beggs, from Cleveland?
[01:35:49.000 --> 01:35:57.000]  Well, last night there was a 71 arrest. But on top of that, there were some protesters who, there's a place down the street called Harry Buffalo on East Fork.
[01:35:57.000 --> 01:36:00.000]  And that's where most of the protests happened last night.
[01:36:00.000 --> 01:36:06.000]  The window was up and a protestor came and ran by and grabbed a sign and threw it at a table of people.
[01:36:06.000 --> 01:36:11.000]  It actually hit a guy on the shoulder and, you know, startled him, injured him a bit.
[01:36:11.000 --> 01:36:18.000]  And then also there were protesters running around with pepper spray, pepper spraying bystanders who were innocently just having lunch or dinner, I should say.
[01:36:18.000 --> 01:36:23.000]  Yeah, more and more we had. And let me guess, was this racially directed?
[01:36:23.000 --> 01:36:30.000]  I believe so. I haven't got any confirmation, but I keep hearing different stories, but at this time, I'm not really sure.
[01:36:30.000 --> 01:36:36.000]  Anybody pepper sprays me for no reason. I'm gonna knock him upside the head. I mean, this is insane.
[01:36:36.000 --> 01:36:43.000]  What was that, Nico? Oh, Joe's feed froze for a moment. All right, closing comments, Joe Beggs, we'll get more from you.
[01:36:43.000 --> 01:36:51.000]  Yeah, if someone tries to pepper spray me, all I can say is it will be shocking for them. I got a new little toy yesterday, so.
[01:36:51.000 --> 01:36:56.000]  All right, we'll be safe out there tonight, Joe. We'll see you tomorrow.
[01:36:56.000 --> 01:36:57.000]  All right, we'll see you later.
[01:36:57.000 --> 01:37:04.000]  All right, there goes Joe Beggs. I'm sure he'll now go investigate the cheerleaders, the college cheerleaders.
[01:37:04.000 --> 01:37:15.000]  Excuse me. I gotta have some fun here. I want to go to Saul, Dan, Antoine, Carter and others that are patiently holding in this segment in the next.
[01:37:15.000 --> 01:37:18.000]  I do have some other news I'm going to hit as well. I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[01:37:18.000 --> 01:37:23.000]  Saul in New York, thank you for holding, sir. You're on the air.
[01:37:23.000 --> 01:37:32.000]  Hey, Alex, I was just giving a call because I want to make a comment about the TPP.
[01:37:32.000 --> 01:37:44.000]  We actually got a caller calling about the TPP. Wow, thank you. Yes, the Trans-Pacific Partnership Global Corporate Government Secret and Congress is moving to pass it. It's passed the Senate.
[01:37:44.000 --> 01:38:04.000]  Well, yeah, and I also wanted to tie that into kind of what was going on now. I mean, if you look at it from, I guess you could say, like a thousand mile or a thousand foot high view, it's really all just with all the race riding and all the distractions, basically.
[01:38:04.000 --> 01:38:18.000]  It's just really what it comes down to is that Operation Gladio Part II, they're using a distraction. They're creating different groups and having everybody balkanize against each other to create a distraction.
[01:38:18.000 --> 01:38:26.000]  And they're using all this alphabet soup to throw at people to try and describe basically the fact that they're going to take over everybody.
[01:38:26.000 --> 01:38:35.000]  I agree. We're going into global government. The whole programs moves into high gear. For those that don't know, describe Operation Gladio for them.
[01:38:35.000 --> 01:38:57.000]  Well, I mean, I'm sure you could probably do a way better job than I can. But, I mean, more or less, the first, there were two Operation Gladios. The first one was more or less just a way to be able to get people, or basically they created a group of people that, you know, are more or less the government
[01:38:57.000 --> 01:39:15.000]  to attack themselves. They created a group of people like a boogie man to scare. That got exposed and then it died down. The second Operation Gladio started, well, partially started with Turkey and different Islamic groups coming together with
[01:39:15.000 --> 01:39:28.000]  the globalist government to create al Qaeda. And it just got expanded from there. That's right. You have the declassified by the Italians, the NATO option, blowing up train stations, you name it, to blend their political enemies.
[01:39:28.000 --> 01:39:42.000]  And that happened all over Europe, not just in Italy, but it came out in Italy. And then you have the whole radicalization of Islam. And then now it's been declassified, well, not declassified, leaked to judicial watch that indeed the Pentagon is running ISIS.
[01:39:42.000 --> 01:40:01.000]  It's not non-incredible. I know it's ridiculous. And well, just to tie it into kind of the zombie-like creatures that attacked you the other day, their main job as peons is just to create a distraction.
[01:40:01.000 --> 01:40:17.000]  They've been handed everything their entire life. Actually, I was sad to say, I went to college with people just like this. And they're so weird that you can't even hold a conversation with them half the time.
[01:40:17.000 --> 01:40:33.000]  I have to agree to you. I mean, they were basically like, and I don't mean this meanly, they were like mildly retarded or like autistic but demonic. It's like you add a demon to an autistic person and you get one of these guys.
[01:40:33.000 --> 01:40:52.000]  Well, yeah, I mean, I wouldn't disagree with you there. But part of the reason why they cling so tightly onto communism is because all it's doing is just pushing their way of life, which is, you know, the mommy or the daddy just gives me everything I want and I just act out and I like an idiot basically on TV.
[01:40:52.000 --> 01:40:57.000]  Absolutely. It's like a five-year-old crap on their drawers to make the parents upset.
[01:40:57.000 --> 01:41:19.000]  Right, exactly. But I mean, moving a little bit back to the TPP, I mean, they've been, it's not, this isn't the only thing that they're trying. They're trying to act, you know, all sorts of different, all the different attacks, I guess you could say, to all basically do the same thing.
[01:41:19.000 --> 01:41:30.000]  And they're not, even if we beat them here, and which I hope we do, you know, I hope and pray that we do, but even if we beat them here, they're just going to try again. And it's not even so much like we have to feel exhausted.
[01:41:30.000 --> 01:41:39.000]  This is just like, I mean, we have to get so good at beating them. It's just like taking a run in the park that you just, because they're going to try the exact same thing.
[01:41:39.000 --> 01:41:51.000]  Exactly. We've got to make it like exercise and realize that we beat them nine times out of ten. The problem is they just attack us ten times, and so they always win. We've got to keep fighting, keep fighting, keep fighting, keep fighting.
[01:41:51.000 --> 01:42:02.000]  We've got to repeal Obamacare. We look, we're beating them on the Second Amendment. We're beating them on abortion. But notice they've got control of the federal government, so they're beating us on borders.
[01:42:02.000 --> 01:42:14.000]  They're beating us on energy. They're beating us on destabilization. But not for long. Our own military is leaking that they don't want to work with ISIS. I mean, this is a really good news.
[01:42:14.000 --> 01:42:24.000]  That's why the government wants us to have a mindless fight, as you said, with the police and military, because for all their problems, they at least are more awake on average than the public.
[01:42:24.000 --> 01:42:34.000]  So we need to be working with them to wake them up, not mindlessly fighting with each other, while George Soros will laugh from a distance. Anything else you'd like to add, Saul?
[01:42:34.000 --> 01:42:44.000]  Just one last thing I wanted to add. To the first caller who was kind of getting discouraged because he was trying to explain to people.
[01:42:44.000 --> 01:42:56.000]  I've been trying to explain to people kind of the same thing for years, and what I realized is that you don't need to take the exact article for the exact argument that they're being presented. All you really have to do is...
[01:42:56.000 --> 01:43:18.000]  Stay there. I want to hear this. I want to hear what you really do.

[01:47:21.000 --> 01:47:28.000]  In defense of human liberty, Alex Jones.
[01:47:34.000 --> 01:47:36.000]  Amarillo by morning.
[01:47:38.000 --> 01:47:40.000]  Amarillo is where I'll be.
[01:47:42.000 --> 01:47:44.000]  Thank you for joining us, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:47:44.000 --> 01:47:56.000]  Look, it's all a big con game. The globalists want you to think they're invincible. They don't want you to think you have any power so that the general public believes that, and so we just lay down.
[01:47:56.000 --> 01:48:07.000]  The truth is, what they're doing is outrageously criminal, outrageously bad, outrageously stupid, outrageously centralized.
[01:48:07.000 --> 01:48:15.000]  Even for them, it screws up the prosperity, but they can't help it short term getting all that power.
[01:48:17.000 --> 01:48:32.000]  So all we've got to do is form an opposition, point out what they're doing, point out the alternatives, have a debate, not get radicalized, not get in the civil war, even if they attack us up front.
[01:48:32.000 --> 01:48:45.000]  You've got to know when to hold them, know when to fold them. I intend to just take licks like Mahatma Gandhi or others, or Christ for that matter, because then that will fully destroy them.
[01:48:45.000 --> 01:48:53.000]  Or if we're outnumbered and they take us out at some event like the Alamo, that's even better. Just as long as it's heroic.
[01:48:53.000 --> 01:49:05.000]  As long as we're outnumbered and overrun, in the end, that will destroy the globalist, because it's all a fight for hearts and minds, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:49:05.000 --> 01:49:15.000]  That doesn't mean they start grabbing folks and putting us in FEMA camps. We shouldn't fight back. It's just that so many people in the Liberty Movement always prepare to fight physically.
[01:49:15.000 --> 01:49:25.000]  I'm saying put that into the Info War. Put that energy into taking action. We'll have victories. Spend 30% of your time getting ready for a shooting war.
[01:49:26.000 --> 01:49:34.000]  Because if you won't put the time and energy in now to take things back peacefully, I assure you a shooting war starts.
[01:49:34.000 --> 01:49:38.000]  Most of the big talkers aren't going to be out there with their firearms.
[01:49:38.000 --> 01:49:49.000]  So I work towards peace, because anybody that knows my ammo understands if it comes down to physical stuff, I will defend my family, and then I will not be forgiving.
[01:49:49.000 --> 01:50:00.000]  But let's not even talk about that. We have liberty. We have freedom. We have common sense and honor. We're the winners. We're the Americana.
[01:50:00.000 --> 01:50:11.000]  We trump the globalist every time. We're moving forward. We're having victory. That's why they're moving so fast, because they admit they're in trouble.
[01:50:11.000 --> 01:50:20.000]  We are beating the daylights out of them right now. Coming from behind, hundreds of points, and that's why get ready for fireworks.
[01:50:20.000 --> 01:50:29.000]  Get ready for them to pull the stops out. It's going to get nasty, but just know this. Hold fast. We're going to make it through this.
[01:50:29.000 --> 01:50:39.000]  All right. Finish up real quick, Saul. I've got about five, six other callers like Antoine, Dan, Carter. I want to get to finish up your point of people that you can't wake up.
[01:50:39.000 --> 01:50:47.000]  I just say move on. But you were saying, hey, don't worry about giving them an encyclopedia of proof up front. You were going to finish.
[01:50:47.000 --> 01:50:58.000]  So, yeah, I was just going to say, you don't have to worry about, you know, basically, as I've made the mistake before in the past of verbally vomiting in their ear for three hours, which doesn't work.
[01:50:58.000 --> 01:51:07.000]  But basically, all you have to do is just present a small amount of information in your own way.
[01:51:07.000 --> 01:51:18.000]  Let's say if you're into gardening, and you want to buy seeds or whatever, and you talk to other people that guard, and you want to talk to them about the TPP,
[01:51:18.000 --> 01:51:29.000]  or any of these, you know, different things for government control, all you have to do is just say, hey, imagine if, you know, we couldn't even buy seeds, or imagine if we only had to buy GMO seeds.
[01:51:29.000 --> 01:51:35.000]  And that's in the TPP. Well said, yes. So show them something that touches them. God bless you.
[01:51:35.000 --> 01:51:41.000]  I just explained, hey, the very same globalists setting up this world government have robbed all these countries of their pension funds,
[01:51:41.000 --> 01:51:49.000]  and you will be basically euthanized under this system. That's why they sell how sexy it is to get rid of grandma.
[01:51:49.000 --> 01:51:57.000]  You're 50 years old. You think it's cool to have death panels because you think it saves you money. You're going to be 70, 80 in the blink of an eye.
[01:51:57.000 --> 01:52:05.000]  Don't be a chump. There's different ways to reach out to people. I tend to do the two by four upside the head.
[01:52:05.000 --> 01:52:14.000]  I agree. The slicker approach sometimes is good. Look, Jack Spratt could eat no fat. His wife could eat no lean.
[01:52:14.000 --> 01:52:21.000]  So between the two of them, they lick the platter clean. That's what's so great about the diversity of this world.
[01:52:21.000 --> 01:52:25.000]  All of us together doing the right thing, having the heart for freedom.
[01:52:25.000 --> 01:52:35.000]  We will change the world in little ways that together in the aggregate sum, we'll overthrow this system and bring the Republic back, bring human liberty back.
[01:52:35.000 --> 01:52:39.000]  Antoine in California, thanks for holding. Welcome.
[01:52:39.000 --> 01:52:41.000]  Yeah. Hi, Alex.
[01:52:41.000 --> 01:52:42.000]  Welcome.
[01:52:42.000 --> 01:52:58.000]  Yeah, so I have some advice for you other before I talk about the TPP and the things that may happen in the fall. There's my channel on YouTube called The Orbiter.
[01:52:58.000 --> 01:53:04.000]  I think you should spend about 20 minutes looking through some of the playlist and it might very much help you.
[01:53:04.000 --> 01:53:18.000]  But the TPP, I think that this is a way to take over the grid so that in case of an emergency, they can ship people like you, myself, down internet, cable, television, all that stuff.
[01:53:18.000 --> 01:53:22.000]  Exactly, because it links up worldwide internet censorship. Absolutely.
[01:53:22.000 --> 01:53:35.000]  Yeah, well, there's the emergency, the scary part. I don't want to be a doom and gloomer, but if you look up at the sun around sunset, you can look up at about two o'clock, one o'clock at the two o'clock.
[01:53:35.000 --> 01:53:40.000]  It's pretty high above the sun, but there's a planet up there.
[01:53:40.000 --> 01:53:58.000]  And if you look for a video called NBC News Reports New Peru from Yaza, USA, which is your own world, they show the video of these reporters about two or three days ago with their helicopter looking up and they were just wondering what it was.
[01:53:58.000 --> 01:54:07.000]  I know. It's in mainstream news, all these weird trumpet sounds and record earthquakes and a lot of crazy stuff going on and government is running around like a chicken with its head cut off.
[01:54:07.000 --> 01:54:10.000]  What do you think it is? Earth changes?
[01:54:10.000 --> 01:54:25.000]  Well, I've been monitoring this stuff, something really crazy. And back in 2012, 2011, I saw the same planet or whatever it is. It's got to be a planet because it doesn't glimmer like a star.
[01:54:25.000 --> 01:54:44.000]  And I saw it on the left side of the sun more towards probably your seven o'clock and it was brighter than the helicopter. I had my friend on the phone and he told me it was a helicopter and there was a football game going on behind the hill.
[01:54:44.000 --> 01:54:49.000]  I'm in San Francisco. He said there was a helicopter. I said, no, it's not moving.
[01:54:49.000 --> 01:55:00.000]  Now, what you've seen, I mean, here's the deal. We're in the middle of space. Who knows what's going on? What you've seen, I've seen before like at like three o'clock in the afternoon and there's this big bright light up above the sun.
[01:55:00.000 --> 01:55:08.000]  And then about an hour later, it wasn't there anymore and there's been news videos of it. There's so many mysteries in this universe. Who knows what's going on?
[01:55:08.000 --> 01:55:18.000]  Bottom line, our governments are not telling us everything. I think that's clear. Thank you for the call. Good to hear from you. Carter in South Carolina, you're on the air. Go ahead.
[01:55:18.000 --> 01:55:35.000]  Yeah, I was just going to say that, you know, as regarding to the TPP, that if you read Article 1, Section 7, Clause 1 of the United States Constitution, all bills for raising revenue shall originate in the House of Representatives, but the Senate may propose or concur with
[01:55:35.000 --> 01:55:50.000]  amendments as on other bills. So here's my question. How has the House of Representatives acknowledged that this bill does not generate revenue in order to put it further in the judicial process?
[01:55:50.000 --> 01:56:06.000]  Well, obviously when Obama became the head of the United Nations for a tour four years ago, it violated Article 1, Section 9. They violated whole cloth. I mean, just like the NSA spying on the American people. But let me go to Article 1, Section 9.
[01:56:06.000 --> 01:56:21.000]  Now, here it is right here in my pocket Constitution. Section 7, all bills for raising revenue shall originate in the House of Representatives, but the Senate may propose or concur with amendments as on other bills.
[01:56:21.000 --> 01:56:36.000]  And then it goes through it. And then if you go to Section 9 of Article 1, that deals with the president or other groups in government basically being part of other governments.
[01:56:36.000 --> 01:56:49.000]  And this is exactly what they're now doing. So I'm glad you bring up that point. What's your overall take on the TPP? I mean, what about Congress giving away authority on something they're not allowed to read?
[01:56:49.000 --> 01:57:05.000]  They can't. No, but that Section 7, all bills raising revenue. Does this bill raise revenue? That's my question because if I can't read it, how has the House said it? Yes, it affects tariff trade, internet taxes.
[01:57:05.000 --> 01:57:15.000]  Then it's pretended legislation. I hear you. As defined in the Declaration of Independence.
[01:57:15.000 --> 01:57:22.000]  I agree with you. Thank you, Carter. Great points. Dan in Las Vegas, you got 30 seconds of the show's over. Go ahead.
[01:57:22.000 --> 01:57:32.000]  Thank you very much. In regards to this being a criminal government, three quick things are a Constitution that says taxes shall be uniform. Only gold and silver can be legal tender.
[01:57:32.000 --> 01:57:41.000]  And it says no preference shall be given by any regulation of commerce. When they give subsidies to the guys that pay for their campaign, they're violating the preference clause.
[01:57:41.000 --> 01:57:50.000]  You're right. Congress is involved in insider trading, you name it. We have a rogue criminal government at the top. It's time to change it and take the Republic back.
