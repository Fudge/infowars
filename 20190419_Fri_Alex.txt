[00:00.000 --> 00:23.480]  So after two long years here we are it's hard to believe that any of it actually happened
[00:23.480 --> 00:30.040]  looking back, it was two years of unremitting, never diminishing hysteria about Russia.
[00:30.040 --> 00:36.600]  It was a continuous wave of panic and superstition over unseen Slavic interference, all stoked
[00:36.600 --> 00:40.720]  by the very people we're told are the most rational in our society.
[00:40.720 --> 00:46.640]  For two years our capital city became a kind of massive CNN panel, a living monument to
[00:46.640 --> 00:52.160]  ignorance and dishonesty were the loudest and the dumbest invariably got the most attention.
[00:52.160 --> 00:58.080]  We just lived through two full years of that screaming, threatening, surveillance, character
[00:58.080 --> 01:04.120]  assassination, loyalty tests, wild allegations of treason and spying and betrayal from office
[01:04.120 --> 01:05.640]  holders.
[01:05.640 --> 01:09.600]  Innocent people find themselves afraid to go to dinner, scared to send text messages
[01:09.600 --> 01:11.360]  or talk on the phone.
[01:11.360 --> 01:15.120]  For two years we lived in an all-pervasive cult of personality.
[01:15.120 --> 01:20.400]  Our leaders worshiped a 74-year-old federal prosecutor who almost never spoke in public.
[01:20.400 --> 01:24.960]  He alone was good, they told us, only they could interpret his will.
[01:24.960 --> 01:29.840]  It was all thoroughly bizarre, demented really though nobody said so at the time, they were
[01:29.840 --> 01:30.840]  too afraid.
[01:30.840 --> 01:36.000]  It seems like a dream now, which actually it was, none of it was real.
[01:36.000 --> 01:41.640]  Nobody colluded with Vladimir Putin, nobody changed vote totals or met secretly in Prague
[01:41.640 --> 01:46.880]  or had a pee tape, whatever that is, there was never a Russia conspiracy, Hillary Clinton
[01:46.880 --> 01:52.440]  wasn't robbed of her rightful position by Julian Assange or Roger Stone or anyone else.
[01:52.440 --> 01:57.400]  Hillary lost the election because she was an entitled boor who didn't run on anything.
[01:57.400 --> 02:00.320]  In the end, that's what Robert Mueller proved.
[02:00.320 --> 02:03.000]  The news anchors couldn't handle that, they couldn't handle that conclusion.
[02:03.000 --> 02:07.840]  It was too far from what they promised their audiences for so long, they were too invested
[02:07.840 --> 02:09.240]  in the lies.
[02:09.240 --> 02:13.080]  When the report arrived in Congress this morning, they found themselves reduced to huffing and
[02:13.080 --> 02:14.080]  sputtering.
[02:14.080 --> 02:16.080]  They could admit what was in the report.
[02:16.080 --> 02:21.640]  Well, they told us, Robert Mueller didn't exonerate President Trump, okay, I mean that
[02:21.640 --> 02:27.280]  may be true, but only theologically, Mueller doesn't have the power to absolve sin only
[02:27.280 --> 02:32.320]  God can, but in every other sense, Mueller's report was exculpatory.
[02:32.320 --> 02:37.040]  If dozens of federal prosecutors spent two years trying to charge you with the crime
[02:37.040 --> 02:41.680]  and then found they couldn't, it would mean there wasn't any real evidence you did it
[02:41.680 --> 02:43.280]  and that's what happened here.
[02:43.280 --> 02:47.880]  You may not like Donald Trump, but that's what we just learned from the Mueller report.
[02:47.880 --> 02:51.120]  You would have to be a mindless partisan to deny it.
[02:51.120 --> 02:54.880]  A lot of news anchors turn out to be mindless partisans.
[02:54.880 --> 02:59.040]  When the facts contraven the interests of their party, they deny the facts, then they
[02:59.040 --> 03:03.760]  attack anyone who persists in stating the obvious out loud.
[03:03.760 --> 03:09.480]  So suddenly the very same people who lied to you for two years about Russia are demanding
[03:09.480 --> 03:13.800]  that under no circumstances are you allowed to believe anything that the Attorney General
[03:13.800 --> 03:15.320]  Bill Barr might say.
[03:15.320 --> 03:18.640]  Sure, Barr may look like a conventional Republican.
[03:18.640 --> 03:23.240]  He was a Jeb Bush donor and everything and he does appear to be a close personal friend
[03:23.240 --> 03:28.040]  of Robert Mueller's, but that's why he's so tricky.
[03:28.040 --> 03:29.160]  It's all a ruse.
[03:29.160 --> 03:34.520]  In fact, Barr is a Putin stooge like all the rest.
[03:34.520 --> 03:42.480]  If you look at his behavior, it is not that of a geriatric, it is that of a partisan.
[03:42.480 --> 03:44.240]  This looks like an inside job.
[03:44.240 --> 03:48.760]  We shouldn't take anything that Barr says tomorrow as anything other than performative
[03:48.760 --> 03:49.760]  coonery.
[03:49.760 --> 03:53.840]  Is Barr, the president's new fix, the answer to that seems to be yes.
[03:53.840 --> 04:00.400]  But he becomes the first cabinet secretary to plunge into the deep end of Trump's conspiracy
[04:00.400 --> 04:01.400]  pool.
[04:01.400 --> 04:05.240]  I don't normally start the broadcast with somebody else's show, but Tucker Carlson
[04:05.240 --> 04:09.280]  hit such a hole in one there, you've got to do it.
[04:09.280 --> 04:15.640]  I really had time to reflect on what's unfolding and we've got some really good news concerning
[04:15.640 --> 04:16.640]  the Mueller report.
[04:16.640 --> 04:17.640]  We've got some really bad news.
[04:17.640 --> 04:21.880]  I'm going to break down on the other side and then we've got the former head of the
[04:21.880 --> 04:28.360]  border patrol, the former head of ICE and a whole bunch of other former leaders coming
[04:28.360 --> 04:30.640]  out and saying, listen.
[04:30.640 --> 04:33.560]  This is five, 10 times worse than anything we've ever seen.
[04:33.560 --> 04:36.520]  Our border has collapsed.
[04:36.520 --> 04:40.240]  Former DEA head says US border collapsing.
[04:40.240 --> 04:41.800]  That means the country's collapsing.
[04:41.800 --> 04:44.320]  And think about the Democrats.
[04:44.320 --> 04:48.040]  Up until two weeks ago, they said there was no border crisis and a few months ago killed
[04:48.040 --> 04:49.800]  funding for it.
[04:49.800 --> 04:50.800]  Remember?
[04:50.800 --> 04:52.800]  Killed the funding.
[04:52.800 --> 05:21.280]  Stay with us, we'll be right back.
[05:21.280 --> 05:27.800]  To find out, we employed a series of tests for heavy metals, alkalinity and pH.
[05:27.800 --> 05:31.800]  What we learned was that there was in fact unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity
[05:31.800 --> 05:33.160]  in the rainwater.
[05:33.160 --> 05:38.520]  Next, we tested the water from our Alexa pure gravity filter and not only were the heavy
[05:38.520 --> 05:44.600]  metal levels within safe measure, but the pH was also restored to optimal levels.
[05:44.600 --> 05:49.440]  As it turns out, the filter on the Alexa pure raises the pH of the water.
[05:49.440 --> 05:54.320]  So what we've learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater
[05:54.320 --> 05:55.320]  supply.
[05:55.320 --> 06:07.960]  But more importantly, a good water filtration system will purify it.
[06:07.960 --> 06:09.960]  Big brother.
[06:09.960 --> 06:13.120]  Mainstream media.
[06:13.120 --> 06:14.120]  Government coverups.
[06:14.120 --> 06:15.120]  You want answers?
[06:15.120 --> 06:16.120]  Well, so does he.
[06:16.120 --> 06:23.120]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[06:23.120 --> 06:38.120]  I'm having a good day too, it was called no collusion, no obstruction.
[06:38.120 --> 06:51.720]  There never was, by the way, and there never will be.
[06:51.720 --> 06:56.840]  And we do have to get to the bottom of these things, I will say, and this should never
[06:56.840 --> 06:57.840]  happen.
[06:57.840 --> 07:03.160]  I say this in front of my friends, wounded warriors, and I just call them warriors because
[07:03.160 --> 07:06.160]  we just shook hands and they look great.
[07:06.160 --> 07:09.080]  They look so good and so beautiful.
[07:09.080 --> 07:15.000]  But I say it in front of my friends, this should never happen to another president again.
[07:15.000 --> 07:21.400]  This hoax, it should never happen to another president.
[07:21.400 --> 07:22.400]  Well the fight is on.
[07:22.400 --> 07:25.280]  If you're a radio listener, I would direct you to drudgerport.com.
[07:25.280 --> 07:32.040]  You can see it, a big image of the 400 plus pages, but beside each other with the areas
[07:32.040 --> 07:39.520]  that are redacted, standing out, and you know, President Trump does have a soft place in
[07:39.520 --> 07:47.120]  his heart for soldiers and sailors and Marines and people that put it all on the line.
[07:47.120 --> 07:49.600]  He's a fan of people that take action.
[07:49.600 --> 07:52.560]  He's a fan of humanity, that's what the globalists don't like, Trump.
[07:52.560 --> 07:56.280]  They're telling us we're in the post male and female era.
[07:56.280 --> 08:01.520]  This is the world where the beta cuts rule, well, not so fast.
[08:01.520 --> 08:13.880]  So I had time to read over the report last night and today, and it's exactly what I thought
[08:13.880 --> 08:19.000]  was going to come out in the report even back six months ago.
[08:19.000 --> 08:26.520]  Because Trump stood up, Congressman Nunes stood up, Senator Paul stood up, Jim Jordan
[08:26.520 --> 08:31.480]  stood up, you the audience stood up, Tucker Carlson stood up, Sean Hannity stood up,
[08:31.480 --> 08:40.080]  I stood up, our crew stood up, Owen Shroyer stood up, David Knight stood up, and we all
[08:40.080 --> 08:44.480]  got called Russian agents and some of us got investigated and some of us got harassed and
[08:44.480 --> 08:47.040]  some of us had our bank accounts taken away.
[08:47.040 --> 08:48.040]  I'm still listed.
[08:48.040 --> 08:57.080]  We're going to probably have to file the lawsuit next month by G2 in Boston as a terrorist,
[08:57.080 --> 09:02.320]  as a money launderer, as a criminal, no judge, no jury.
[09:02.320 --> 09:05.760]  That's just what the bankers do, that's what the white shoe boys do.
[09:05.760 --> 09:09.360]  They think it's all funny.
[09:09.360 --> 09:12.280]  When they're the traders selling out the country, they're the globalists, and then they turn
[09:12.280 --> 09:17.200]  around and say people that love this country have nothing but records of standing up for
[09:17.200 --> 09:21.320]  it, that we're the ones have to be watched.
[09:21.320 --> 09:25.400]  How do you flip the script when you're a bunch of traders, globalists, who want to get rid
[09:25.400 --> 09:29.160]  of the country and say you want to get rid of it, and are collapsing its borders and
[09:29.160 --> 09:35.760]  fighting the president trying to defend the borders, what do you do to try to put that
[09:35.760 --> 09:42.240]  in check when it's so obvious you're the enemy of the unborn and the born and the left wants
[09:42.240 --> 09:43.480]  to euthanize old people?
[09:43.480 --> 09:47.680]  I mean, they're just villains.
[09:47.680 --> 09:51.720]  Teaching people that if you want to get ahead, somebody else has to lose, instead of building
[09:51.720 --> 09:59.760]  economies that are about really taking care of people, they're evil.
[09:59.760 --> 10:05.640]  So I've got some good news and some bad news about the Mueller report, but I can tell you
[10:05.640 --> 10:12.160]  this, it's definitely bitter sweet, or it's sweet on the tip of your tongue and sour going
[10:12.160 --> 10:18.240]  down because the criminals that did all this are walking free and are so arrogant, they're
[10:18.240 --> 10:24.400]  calling for new investigations and new congressional witch hunts, and they're up on their hind legs,
[10:24.400 --> 10:25.400]  more arrogant than ever.
[10:25.400 --> 10:32.960]  So this is a blueprint for impeachment and proof of the Russian takeover, they've only
[10:32.960 --> 10:43.800]  gotten more arrogant and they have been kicking me in the gut hard for about three years.
[10:43.800 --> 10:48.680]  I mean, folks, if I told you the stuff that I'm not going to get into for a lot of reasons
[10:48.680 --> 10:52.480]  that they've done to me, I'm not saying I'm a victim, I'm a target, but let me tell you,
[10:52.480 --> 10:57.720]  these are criminals, and they know exactly what they're doing, but of course, they're
[10:57.720 --> 10:59.560]  globalist traders.
[10:59.560 --> 11:05.080]  They're the globalist boarding party to lower the drawbridge and run up the white flag.
[11:05.080 --> 11:06.600]  They're the enemy.
[11:06.600 --> 11:11.760]  And you go, if you have the most powerful, richest country in the world with the best
[11:11.760 --> 11:16.920]  military and incredible resources, why would you sell it out to the chai comms?
[11:16.920 --> 11:23.240]  I mean, even from a global domination view, you wouldn't do that, but see, there's a spirit
[11:23.240 --> 11:25.120]  that wants to bring down America.
[11:25.120 --> 11:29.360]  So a lot of the people say a note of globalism right now aren't even good guys.
[11:29.360 --> 11:35.480]  They just don't have the pure anti-Christ spirit of why will we kill babies after they're
[11:35.480 --> 11:36.480]  born?
[11:36.480 --> 11:37.640]  Why would we give up all our power?
[11:37.640 --> 11:43.240]  Why would we see?
[11:43.240 --> 11:49.280]  Why would we let lesser men and women like Clinton and Cuomo rule us, and see, that's
[11:49.280 --> 11:50.540]  the globalist big problem.
[11:50.540 --> 11:56.400]  Our founders created separation of powers so that you wouldn't have too much power concentrate
[11:56.400 --> 12:01.520]  one place, but also so powerful people would battle with each other overpower instead of
[12:01.520 --> 12:05.240]  consolidating power and attacking little people.
[12:05.240 --> 12:09.240]  So while they're distracted battling over power, we can build a civilization.
[12:09.240 --> 12:17.400]  Our forebears were imminently intelligent, imminently educated in the real school of
[12:17.400 --> 12:24.720]  the world, but also in letters, and they were also divinely touched with divine inspiration.
[12:24.720 --> 12:27.920]  There's no doubting it.
[12:27.920 --> 12:33.720]  And we stand on the foundation they built against these enemies, the controlled globalist
[12:33.720 --> 12:41.400]  collaborator press, the big mega banks, Hollywood, that spews the most debilitating, demoralizing
[12:41.400 --> 12:50.760]  anti-human crap the world's ever seen at our people 24 seven.
[12:50.760 --> 12:57.520]  Communist China has a controlling stake in the all six major Hollywood production houses,
[12:57.520 --> 13:07.000]  studios, and almost all of our films are banned, that they're actually financing in China.
[13:07.000 --> 13:11.400]  Unless their government approved by China, then China always saves the day, the Communist
[13:11.400 --> 13:12.400]  always saves the day.
[13:12.400 --> 13:18.800]  Think about how far down the rat hole we are, that they're financing family destroying,
[13:18.800 --> 13:24.800]  economy destroying, mental illness, they're teaching mental illness in Hollywood, in the
[13:24.800 --> 13:28.120]  whole culture, on record, it's come out in WikiLeaks.
[13:28.120 --> 13:39.800]  And a foreign enemy is financing that.
[13:39.800 --> 13:40.800]  Think about that.
[13:40.800 --> 13:46.560]  And then Trump says America's good, the people are good, we're strong, we believe in each
[13:46.560 --> 13:51.520]  other and they go he's the enemy, get rid of him because he's not demoralizing you.
[13:51.520 --> 13:56.640]  It's such an easy choice that Trump is good, the globalists are bad.
[13:56.640 --> 13:59.480]  It's obvious he's real, that's what the globalists are so pissed.
[13:59.480 --> 14:04.280]  But I'll tell you, Trump's backed by a lot of people who are Machiavellian, but they're
[14:04.280 --> 14:05.280]  still human.
[14:05.280 --> 14:10.960]  They have a little secret pride in America because their granddaddy was proud of it.
[14:10.960 --> 14:14.520]  Even though they sold out to the globalists, even though they're evil in ways, they have
[14:14.520 --> 14:22.200]  that sin like Darth Vader of still caring about their family, they're not completely
[14:22.200 --> 14:24.200]  turned over to madness.
[14:24.200 --> 14:27.600]  Think about that.
[14:27.600 --> 14:34.120]  Yes, it's the good people of this nation, loving, hardworking, dedicated men and women
[14:34.120 --> 14:39.080]  of every race, color, and creed that are the blood of this nation and the guts and the
[14:39.080 --> 14:46.960]  eyes of the years, but remember the other secret ingredient of powerful elites that
[14:46.960 --> 14:55.160]  are saying, why would we feed America headfirst into a woodchipper to satisfy some globalist
[14:55.160 --> 15:01.360]  pissing contest to mount our head on a wall?
[15:01.360 --> 15:06.800]  It will be America that doesn't mount your head on a wall, globalist, it will be America
[15:06.800 --> 15:15.760]  that overtakes you to feature sick ideas and launches humanity beyond the stars, beyond
[15:15.760 --> 15:18.280]  the stars.
[15:18.280 --> 15:22.440]  We're going to have scientific breakthroughs, the beginnings of which have already happened,
[15:22.440 --> 15:27.600]  where we're going to leap in human development and human understanding to levels you can't
[15:27.600 --> 15:34.720]  even imagine and the globalists know this and their lord, their master is very old and
[15:34.720 --> 15:41.520]  knows that we are about to enter the next level and they are screaming with anger because
[15:41.520 --> 15:51.720]  we are so majestic compared to them, we are so beautiful, prepare to fight for the future
[15:51.720 --> 15:52.720]  of humanity.

[17:03.240 --> 17:04.240]  stories.
[17:04.240 --> 17:08.120]  I was 35 with two beautiful children when my life and addiction started to spiral out
[17:08.120 --> 17:09.200]  of control.
[17:09.200 --> 17:14.800]  After my divorce I went into a depression cycle and started drinking more often and using
[17:14.800 --> 17:16.400]  prescription drugs.
[17:16.400 --> 17:20.640]  After my second DWI and arrest, my ex-husband threatened to take our children away from
[17:20.640 --> 17:21.640]  me.
[17:21.640 --> 17:24.680]  I was 17 when I became addicted to heroin and meth.
[17:24.680 --> 17:28.200]  I thought I could quit on my own, but I couldn't.
[17:28.200 --> 17:30.920]  It hit me when I was arrested.

[18:00.400 --> 18:05.680]  InfoWarsLife is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine, introducing pollen block.
[18:05.680 --> 18:11.120]  We have found an extraordinary new, natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms,
[18:11.120 --> 18:17.720]  including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort, and respiratory function.
[18:17.720 --> 18:23.600]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs experienced
[18:23.600 --> 18:26.920]  less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses.
[18:26.920 --> 18:31.840]  They began studying this effect in published trials and decades later we now have the fruit
[18:31.840 --> 18:36.880]  of this research, a fast-acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress
[18:36.880 --> 18:38.280]  symptoms.
[18:38.280 --> 18:40.560]  Pollen block is natural and effective.
[18:40.560 --> 18:41.560]  It is not an antihistamine.
[18:41.560 --> 18:46.480]  In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of
[18:46.480 --> 18:52.320]  tryptase, which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.
[18:52.320 --> 18:55.000]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe.
[18:55.000 --> 19:02.000]  Get to infowarslife.com and grab a pack of our pollen block chewable tablets.

[20:24.840 --> 20:32.560]  So, let me give you the good news and the bad news from my perspective.
[20:32.560 --> 20:33.560]  Alex Jones here at PacLive.
[20:33.560 --> 20:38.960]  Thanks for joining us today on this April 19, 2019 Patriot's Day.
[20:38.960 --> 20:39.960]  Friday.
[20:39.960 --> 20:42.560]  Let's get right into it.
[20:42.560 --> 20:51.600]  Here's the prime analysis and the big overview.
[20:51.600 --> 20:54.960]  The Democrats, the deep state, are in bed with everybody.
[20:54.960 --> 20:57.480]  They're not Russian agents.
[20:57.480 --> 21:01.320]  They're agents to big megacorporations and the Chai comms and others selling the country
[21:01.320 --> 21:03.240]  out to the highest bidder.
[21:03.240 --> 21:04.840]  They're not leaders.
[21:04.840 --> 21:09.520]  The Democrats and the deep staters are pimps.
[21:09.520 --> 21:15.080]  They're nothing but grossers that sell America out.
[21:15.080 --> 21:22.880]  They preside with a little pad of paper and their pen at the cash register selling your
[21:22.880 --> 21:27.840]  birthright out, my birthright.
[21:27.840 --> 21:28.840]  That's it.
[21:28.840 --> 21:32.400]  That's all they are.
[21:32.400 --> 21:40.080]  And so when you see these lowly, ugly, stupid, lying, arrogant, narcissistic, pathetic, fallen
[21:40.080 --> 21:56.120]  people like Nadler and Schiff and Pelosi and AOC, these are the slaves.
[21:56.120 --> 21:57.120]  These are the traders.
[21:57.120 --> 22:04.840]  This is the trash that was brought up to hate America by scum parents.
[22:04.840 --> 22:07.080]  They're all scum.
[22:07.080 --> 22:17.560]  And the minute you realize they have a hunger to beat you because you're better than them,
[22:17.560 --> 22:22.200]  because you have a spirit that's different from them, the minute you realize that you
[22:22.200 --> 22:26.440]  have victory, you're better than them and they know it.
[22:26.440 --> 22:30.640]  The traders, they can be black, they can be white, they can be old, they can be young,
[22:30.640 --> 22:34.200]  but they have a spirit.
[22:34.200 --> 22:38.280]  And this is supposed to be their country, they want control, they want to run it for
[22:38.280 --> 22:42.640]  global domination while they destroy it.
[22:42.640 --> 22:47.680]  They want to expend the energy and the spirit of America into a great evil work.
[22:47.680 --> 22:51.480]  It's an act of satanic alchemy.
[22:51.480 --> 22:55.520]  They want to lie to you to your face to where you don't know up from down, like Clapper
[22:55.520 --> 23:00.120]  that told Congress, the NSA has never spied on one American or never looked at any email
[23:00.120 --> 23:02.780]  or any communication ever in its history.
[23:02.780 --> 23:07.680]  Just like saying the ocean doesn't have one drop of water in it, that bluebirds aren't
[23:07.680 --> 23:13.600]  blue, that the American flag isn't red, white and blue.
[23:13.600 --> 23:20.760]  It's ridiculous and it's perjury, but these criminals can do whatever they want.
[23:20.760 --> 23:24.160]  So they overreached.
[23:24.160 --> 23:26.800]  They could do whatever they want until now.
[23:26.800 --> 23:31.280]  They overreached and thought they were invincible and this whole Russia gate was supposed to
[23:31.280 --> 23:37.960]  be a cover-up of their illegal activity and now they came up so empty, if Mueller could
[23:37.960 --> 23:48.280]  have gotten one American and I know they contacted thousands of people, yours truly, and tried
[23:48.280 --> 23:53.320]  to get people to take money from the Russians and of course it was never the Russians.
[23:53.320 --> 23:57.640]  It was the Democrats, the deep staters, the neocons.
[23:57.640 --> 24:01.280]  We never took one dollar, none of us.
[24:01.280 --> 24:02.280]  Not me, not you.
[24:02.280 --> 24:07.120]  They couldn't find anybody who was a Christian or a conservative or a Trump supporter that
[24:07.120 --> 24:11.720]  would take 20, 30 pieces of silver.
[24:11.720 --> 24:13.600]  They couldn't find a Benedict Arnold.
[24:13.600 --> 24:15.880]  They couldn't find a Judas Iscariot.
[24:15.880 --> 24:21.040]  They couldn't find it even with super hot blonde Russian sex operatives that work for
[24:21.040 --> 24:24.280]  the CIA.
[24:24.280 --> 24:29.200]  They couldn't find one patriot to sell out their country.
[24:29.200 --> 24:36.840]  Of course you couldn't, enemy, because we are the opposite of you and always will be.
[24:36.840 --> 24:41.680]  We're not for sale, scum.
[24:41.680 --> 24:47.240]  We are already sold out to Christ.
[24:47.240 --> 24:50.240]  You'll never get us.
[24:50.240 --> 24:51.680]  And that's what you have to understand is.
[24:51.680 --> 24:59.920]  This is their giant failure and the report itself is a cover-up and a facade that Russia
[24:59.920 --> 25:07.280]  was still involved, as Trump says, BS and it's a cover-up for Rosenstein and McCabe
[25:07.280 --> 25:09.600]  and all the other traders.
[25:09.600 --> 25:12.480]  All the other, we can't be traders who are always against the country, just globalist
[25:12.480 --> 25:16.040]  operatives, foreign soldiers, embedded enemy agents.
[25:16.040 --> 25:18.600]  Really, they're not guilty of treason.
[25:18.600 --> 25:23.040]  These people have all been anti-American their whole lives.
[25:23.040 --> 25:26.720]  The oaths they gave meant nothing because they gave oaths spiritually when they signed
[25:26.720 --> 25:29.600]  their soul over their God.
[25:29.600 --> 25:35.240]  But let me just digress or get out of the digression and get into it.
[25:35.240 --> 25:42.280]  The bad news is this though, the main objective of us not having peace with Russia and making
[25:42.280 --> 25:46.560]  it where Trump can't ever do anything reasonable with Russia when that's the perfect geopolitical
[25:46.560 --> 25:54.200]  answer for worldwide defense of the West, worldwide defense of Christianity, worldwide
[25:54.200 --> 25:58.320]  defense of the family, the path of throwing the globalist oligarchs out.
[25:58.320 --> 26:03.640]  Russia ran the first successful blueprint of this because they hit bottom first.
[26:03.640 --> 26:05.680]  They came up for air first.
[26:05.680 --> 26:09.320]  And it didn't, Russia's not perfect and has its own problems.
[26:09.320 --> 26:15.360]  But the only Russian collusion is in the spirit in that nations all over the world are pulling
[26:15.360 --> 26:18.080]  out of the unelected tyrannical world government.
[26:18.080 --> 26:22.160]  And Russia is almost four times geographically the size of the US.
[26:22.160 --> 26:26.200]  It has a culture in many ways very similar to ours and the West.
[26:26.200 --> 26:31.000]  And geographically, if you study geopolitics on the grand chessboard model that is the
[26:31.000 --> 26:38.320]  model carried out by the CIA, as if it is the model, so it's the template they're using,
[26:38.320 --> 26:44.460]  a link up with the United States and Russia, geographically for ports of entry, military
[26:44.460 --> 26:47.520]  control is global domination.
[26:47.520 --> 26:54.040]  It's the alliance that would defeat radical Islam, stabilize the planet, stop the India-Pakistan
[26:54.040 --> 26:59.000]  time bomb nuclear war, that's the number one threat most analysts believe, checkmate communist
[26:59.000 --> 27:03.440]  China, make them sue for peace and normalize and move out of that authoritarian system
[27:03.440 --> 27:10.760]  that the globalist set up, shut down the EU, break it up, have it enter into a new federation
[27:10.760 --> 27:17.080]  of the free nations, the free nation federation, 1776 worldwide, whatever you want to call
[27:17.080 --> 27:24.240]  it, a real global system where the nation states are in charge but people do meet and
[27:24.240 --> 27:31.120]  discuss to create consensus, because anything the enemy creates is a counterfeit of what
[27:31.120 --> 27:37.000]  we were already building towards, you understand that?
[27:37.000 --> 27:43.560]  Real peace to the best level we can get it, not a utopia, even the Carnegie endowment
[27:43.560 --> 27:51.360]  said 80 years ago is working with Russia, the problem is they had control of Russia with
[27:51.360 --> 27:56.160]  a communist program and wanted to merge that with us, but this reform in Russia is as real
[27:56.160 --> 28:02.160]  as it could be with Christianity and the family and opposing Hollywood, you turn on Russian
[28:02.160 --> 28:06.880]  television, not the stuff that R.T. put out a bunch of liberal crap, but R.T. America
[28:06.880 --> 28:11.640]  is like CNN, but the stuff that is in Russia, turn it on, it's like info wars, the governments
[28:11.640 --> 28:15.840]  in Europe have a plan to break up your families and replace you with Muslims, we're not doing
[28:15.840 --> 28:20.480]  that, get tax exemption and paid, you know, how many 100,000 rubles to have a child, don't
[28:20.480 --> 28:26.840]  let Russia die, don't go with the globalist program of anti-human, because Russia's decided
[28:26.840 --> 28:32.240]  to not kill itself and commit suicide, so the bad news is, yeah, the whole thing was
[28:32.240 --> 28:37.560]  a distraction, we wasted two years on it, it blocked a lot of, you know, Trump's agenda
[28:37.560 --> 28:42.000]  and we call it a victory now, the victory is sending all these crypts to prison, they've
[28:42.000 --> 28:47.440]  already had the victory in creating a new cold war with Russia, leading towards war
[28:47.440 --> 28:52.560]  with Trump being way more brutal to Russia than anybody since before Ronald Reagan, it's
[28:52.560 --> 28:57.440]  very dangerous, just one of Trump's main failings is showing he's on a Russian minion, kicking
[28:57.440 --> 28:59.560]  Russia upside the head for no reason.
[28:59.560 --> 29:03.200]  Stocks and options trading involves financial risk and is not suitable for all investors.

[31:00.200 --> 31:02.840]  Frank in North Carolina, thanks for holding so long, go ahead.
[31:02.840 --> 31:07.600]  Yeah, I just have to say something, man, it seems like every time I turn on your broadcast,
[31:07.600 --> 31:10.280]  your bracket, it just gets old, man.
[31:10.280 --> 31:12.880]  I'm going to shut you down right now, okay?
[31:12.880 --> 31:15.160]  They're taking calls about your nomination.
[31:15.160 --> 31:19.320]  Do you understand they're having congressional hearings, trying to shut us down?
[31:19.320 --> 31:22.440]  Do you understand I'm ringing the alarm?
[31:22.440 --> 31:25.040]  If that was happening to anybody else, I'd be freaked out.
[31:25.040 --> 31:27.600]  I mean, what's it going to take, us being shut down?
[31:27.600 --> 31:28.600]  Is that what you want, Frank?
[31:28.600 --> 31:29.600]  You know what, Alex?
[31:29.600 --> 31:30.600]  Hey, put it on pause again.
[31:30.600 --> 31:36.120]  Hey, Frank, do you understand it's not bragging to say, we are the tip of the spear, we're
[31:36.120 --> 31:38.040]  under attack, we need your help.
[31:38.040 --> 31:42.400]  As much begging as I do, we can barely pay the bills and grow in the face of this.
[31:42.400 --> 31:45.400]  I'm not going to just stop growth and let them start pushing us backwards.
[31:45.400 --> 31:46.400]  Do you understand?
[31:46.400 --> 31:47.600]  I need your help, Frank.
[31:47.600 --> 31:49.880]  I need your help, Frank.
[31:49.880 --> 31:55.520]  Go to inforwarstore.com right now and help fund the Info World.
[31:55.520 --> 31:56.520]  Do you understand?
[31:56.520 --> 31:57.880]  I need your help, Frank.
[31:57.880 --> 32:00.080]  Free press needs your help, Frank.
[32:00.080 --> 32:05.760]  I've been doing a lot of research into Google and YouTube censorship, and I've noticed that
[32:05.760 --> 32:13.640]  there's one type of video that is the most censored, the most buried, the most suppressed.
[32:13.640 --> 32:20.280]  And that's the videos where you saw in 2016 election night, all the arrogant, leftist
[32:20.280 --> 32:25.960]  authoritarians like the young turds and others, get so butt hurt when Trump won.
[32:25.960 --> 32:27.880]  They don't want us to have that victory.
[32:27.880 --> 32:31.080]  They don't want us to remember what political action did.
[32:31.080 --> 32:36.320]  And that's why the globalist, Hillary, and others are trying to shut Info Wars down.
[32:36.320 --> 32:41.400]  This is a fight about taking your speech away, not just my speech, about taking your very
[32:41.400 --> 32:42.800]  sovereignty away.
[32:42.800 --> 32:45.080]  This country is in a war.
[32:45.080 --> 32:48.920]  So again, I want to thank you for what you've done, but I want to remind you, if you don't
[32:48.920 --> 32:51.920]  spread the articles and videos, and if you don't financially get the great products
[32:51.920 --> 32:56.680]  we have and fund us, and the 360 win, we're dead in the water, I'm in your hands, you're
[32:56.680 --> 33:04.080]  in my hands, infowarstore.com, thank you.
[33:04.080 --> 33:23.080]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[33:23.080 --> 33:33.800]  Raging war on corruption, it's Alex Jones, so I'm going to open up the phone in the
[33:33.800 --> 33:34.800]  second and third hour.
[33:34.800 --> 33:35.800]  I had some guests on today.
[33:35.800 --> 33:43.600]  I've cleared the decks, specifically on the Mueller report, what you think is coming next.
[33:43.600 --> 33:50.200]  The big win is Trump wanted to have fall relations with the Russians.
[33:50.200 --> 33:59.520]  Russia has way more resources than the second most resource-laden continent, which is named
[33:59.520 --> 34:04.840]  Africa, that the Chai comms are swallowing up right now.
[34:04.840 --> 34:10.880]  The United States has been specifically, geopolitically cut off by the globalist, sold out.
[34:10.880 --> 34:13.600]  And Trump is just saying, we're not going to do one side of deals anymore.
[34:13.600 --> 34:20.000]  He's barely turned the ship around, and we're already seeing a lot of big dividends.
[34:20.000 --> 34:23.400]  We've already seen the private fellow reserve try to spike that recovery.
[34:23.400 --> 34:30.200]  You can see the whole power structure working against President Trump, but you've got people
[34:30.200 --> 34:34.680]  in the general public and people in government who don't want to destroy the country and
[34:34.680 --> 34:40.560]  who understand that what they've been waiting for is here, so they're behind Trump.
[34:40.560 --> 34:44.400]  So the final equation, we'll get your view on this coming up next hour, give the number
[34:44.400 --> 34:52.400]  out by 20 minutes, and the final equation, Mueller didn't have any choice.
[34:52.400 --> 34:58.680]  You see, Mueller was a deep state fix-it man.
[34:58.680 --> 35:03.520]  Mueller was somebody back from the days in Vietnam who knew how to keep his mouth shut
[35:03.520 --> 35:05.960]  about operations.
[35:05.960 --> 35:15.400]  And so Mueller was a establishment clean-up man back to the days of Whitey Bolger.
[35:15.400 --> 35:20.520]  And you see, Robert Mueller is a follower.
[35:20.520 --> 35:23.080]  And so what does it tell you?
[35:23.080 --> 35:28.560]  Well, it tells you he knows Trump's winning.
[35:28.560 --> 35:30.760]  And you know why Trump's winning?
[35:30.760 --> 35:34.200]  Because Trump's not out of the swamp.
[35:34.200 --> 35:38.240]  And everything Trump's ever done has been completely legal.
[35:38.240 --> 35:43.080]  He's neurotic about nobody's going to set him up.
[35:43.080 --> 35:45.680]  Nobody's going to get dirt on him.
[35:45.680 --> 35:49.400]  Nobody's going to run, you have, I'm the same way.
[35:49.400 --> 35:51.240]  I overpay their fake taxes.
[35:51.240 --> 35:53.280]  I don't even speed anymore.
[35:53.280 --> 35:58.280]  I was driving to work in a 70 at 65 like an old lady today.
[35:58.280 --> 36:02.520]  I notice the older I get, it's something that I'm more careful.
[36:02.520 --> 36:07.680]  It's just that, well, as you get older, you're a yard worker.
[36:07.680 --> 36:10.680]  But the point is, I don't have any instinct to break the law.
[36:10.680 --> 36:13.680]  I don't get off on breaking the law.
[36:13.680 --> 36:16.600]  If a law is wrong, I try to change it.
[36:16.600 --> 36:22.320]  And so Trump is the last person on earth that goes to a hotel and has Russians piss on him.
[36:22.320 --> 36:23.720]  That's ridiculous.
[36:23.720 --> 36:27.040]  You've seen his discipline, his commitment.
[36:27.040 --> 36:29.520]  The guy's a clean freak.
[36:29.520 --> 36:32.200]  It's all crap.
[36:32.200 --> 36:36.040]  It's not about defensive Trump.
[36:36.040 --> 36:39.960]  This is about defensive truth.
[36:39.960 --> 36:43.080]  And so I'm going to say this now, and I'm going to shoot a special video that's a message
[36:43.080 --> 36:47.160]  to the president because these get through to him through certain people at the White
[36:47.160 --> 36:49.080]  House.
[36:49.080 --> 36:53.320]  And General Kelly telling him that he's not to read Info Wars or to watch my videos actually
[36:53.320 --> 36:54.920]  made Trump watch more.
[36:54.920 --> 37:00.360]  And at the New York Times and Washington Post, when they had like 500 articles in the news
[37:00.360 --> 37:04.080]  here and a half ago saying Info Wars banned in the White House, Trump not allowed to read
[37:04.080 --> 37:05.080]  it.
[37:05.080 --> 37:10.880]  I mean, what do you think he does when he sees hundreds and hundreds of articles literally?
[37:10.880 --> 37:13.240]  Because they put it in AP and then it'd be in every newspaper in the country.
[37:13.240 --> 37:18.280]  But sometimes 50 articles a day for weeks on end saying he shouldn't have press passes,
[37:18.280 --> 37:19.280]  get rid of them.
[37:19.280 --> 37:20.280]  Bad Info Wars.
[37:20.280 --> 37:21.280]  Don't let Trump read it.
[37:21.280 --> 37:25.720]  Trump's too weak-minded to listen to Jones, too weak-minded.
[37:25.720 --> 37:30.720]  When Trump watches this show, this is what the real Trump's like behind the scenes.
[37:30.720 --> 37:36.720]  More aggressive than I am, more pissed off, more pro-America, fire-breathing.
[37:36.720 --> 37:43.400]  Trump just finds his apprentice that he never had when he tunes in, and then the enemy knows
[37:43.400 --> 37:44.400]  that.
[37:44.400 --> 37:50.120]  But they try to create this whole projection that I'm telling Trump what to do.
[37:50.120 --> 37:51.840]  No.
[37:51.840 --> 37:56.760]  Trump tunes in and hears exactly what he's already thinking.
[37:56.760 --> 38:01.960]  And so they watched over and over again, him go, that's right.
[38:01.960 --> 38:03.460]  That's it.
[38:03.460 --> 38:04.960]  That's correct.
[38:04.960 --> 38:07.200]  That's the truth.
[38:07.200 --> 38:08.480]  Trump needs that sounding board.
[38:08.480 --> 38:11.600]  That's why you need to go to his rallies, you need to call into the shows, you need to
[38:11.600 --> 38:12.600]  call the White House.
[38:12.600 --> 38:18.480]  You need to talk to him because he needs that interface.
[38:18.480 --> 38:22.200]  You know, Ann Coulter can get a lot of cheap points, and I've invited her on the show.
[38:22.200 --> 38:28.720]  I hope she'll come back, saying, oh, my God, Trump's a traitor.
[38:28.720 --> 38:32.800]  He's offered the Democrats partial amnesty for those that are here, if they'll just give
[38:32.800 --> 38:38.120]  us $12 billion to build a wall and build more detention centers.
[38:38.120 --> 38:41.200]  He knows they're not going to do that, and they're going to man totally open borders,
[38:41.200 --> 38:45.840]  and he shows what frauds they are.
[38:45.840 --> 38:49.520]  And now you see them admitting it's a total crisis, worse than it's ever been, collapse
[38:49.520 --> 38:53.440]  at the border, it's a crisis.
[38:53.440 --> 38:58.560]  And the people telling us that he's a Russian agent and hates America are the ones that
[38:58.560 --> 39:03.960]  publicly say America was never great, it'll never be great.
[39:03.960 --> 39:13.360]  AOC, all of them, Ilhan Omar can't quit running their mouths, and you take some low IQ dumb
[39:13.360 --> 39:17.360]  ass like those women that come from tyranny, and you put them in power and hope they're
[39:17.360 --> 39:23.560]  going to appreciate it, they want to piss all over it because of existential envy.
[39:23.560 --> 39:28.120]  They don't like it.
[39:28.120 --> 39:35.240]  They can't handle it.
[39:35.240 --> 39:40.080]  Those women in Somalia would be sold to sex slaves in five minutes, and if they talked
[39:40.080 --> 39:46.880]  back to their Muslim owners, they'd knock their teeth out.
[39:46.880 --> 39:51.840]  But they can come here where everybody kisses their ass and just piss all over Christianity,
[39:51.840 --> 39:56.960]  piss all over the West, bitching, complaining, tell us how much it sucks, then get your ass
[39:56.960 --> 40:03.600]  out of my country, you piece of trash, you filth, you garbage.
[40:03.600 --> 40:07.320]  There's plenty of people from around the world of every race, color, and creed that appreciate
[40:07.320 --> 40:13.160]  freedom and don't want to piss all over it, so get the hell out scum, you're a curse on
[40:13.160 --> 40:14.160]  this nation.
[40:14.160 --> 40:20.600]  I'm sorry, let me get to the news here.
[40:20.600 --> 40:34.720]  The fact that we have the deep state on Chai-Kong-Tit and the CFR crime syndicate trying to kill
[40:34.720 --> 40:39.520]  this country, and the fact that they ran this whole hoax to take over the election process
[40:39.520 --> 40:43.760]  and overturn the election and have a real authoritarian coup over the election system,
[40:43.760 --> 40:49.800]  and they set up CIA networks publicly with billions of dollars to harass and jack with
[40:49.800 --> 41:00.680]  everyone that's pro-American, I demand justice, President Trump, I demand retribution, I demand
[41:00.680 --> 41:07.840]  that they pay, not because I'm a vengeful person, but because you let these monsters
[41:07.840 --> 41:12.400]  stalk around the countryside feeding on our innocent people.
[41:12.400 --> 41:17.040]  The Democrats can't lick the blood off their lips fast enough as they pass law saying they're
[41:17.040 --> 41:24.040]  going to kill babies after they're born, North Carolina just did it.
[41:24.040 --> 41:27.400]  This isn't politics, we're trying to win the next election, this is cutting the cancer
[41:27.400 --> 41:29.240]  out.
[41:29.240 --> 41:33.720]  We don't sit here and let these groups and organizations run around engaging in their
[41:33.720 --> 41:38.600]  sabotage, or we're aiding and abetting it and it's a dereliction of duty.
[41:38.600 --> 41:45.360]  So I don't ask, I demand that the courts and the president and the Congress remove the
[41:45.360 --> 41:49.760]  Democrat scourge, they are not a party in this nation, they are an outside group of
[41:49.760 --> 41:56.080]  traitors with a giant brainwash mass of mentally ill criminals that work for them trying to
[41:56.080 --> 41:58.640]  bully this nation into hell.
[41:58.640 --> 42:03.440]  This is our new world war two, this is our existential moment, this is the globalist
[42:03.440 --> 42:09.960]  parasites running our country just like they did Russia and I demand the oligarchs be removed.
[42:09.960 --> 42:14.280]  I demand the Federal Reserve be broken up and the president put his people in.
[42:14.280 --> 42:20.520]  I demand all of these traitors that have committed incredible crimes and gotten hundreds of millions
[42:20.520 --> 42:26.080]  of dollars apiece in some cases like Michael Moore of taxpayer money to finance their poison.
[42:26.080 --> 42:36.520]  I want them audited, I want them indicted, I want them in prison now or rollover to die.
[42:36.520 --> 42:41.720]  These very same enemies are trying to crush our borders right now and sack our nation
[42:41.720 --> 42:47.160]  and if we don't rally to save the republic then stick a fork in it and begin the evacuation.
[42:47.160 --> 42:48.160]  But to where?
[42:48.160 --> 42:50.600]  Remember the globalists have their people everywhere.
[42:50.600 --> 42:59.880]  No, we stand and we fly here on this hill, on this republic our forefors forebears built.
[42:59.880 --> 43:02.120]  Feeling your body is hard work.
[43:02.120 --> 43:06.640]  That's why we've introduced the Info Wars Life Daily Digestive Pack to help you fuel

[44:00.320 --> 44:01.760]  I want to say Brain Force is great.
[44:01.760 --> 44:03.760]  I want to say Turbo Force is amazing.
[44:03.760 --> 44:04.760]  It is.
[44:04.760 --> 44:09.240]  But if you took it with fish oil, it's like the fish oil is it.
[44:09.240 --> 44:10.560]  The fish oil is better than that.
[44:10.560 --> 44:12.440]  And that's an example of what I'm talking about.
[44:12.440 --> 44:18.000]  The fish oil is liquid energy, brain, body, heart, the cleanest, the best out there.
[44:18.000 --> 44:19.000]  You've got the children's.
[44:19.000 --> 44:20.000]  You've got the adults.
[44:20.000 --> 44:21.000]  You've got the krill oil.
[44:21.000 --> 44:24.880]  If you're going to get the full effect, the fish oil and the children's are really strong.
[44:24.880 --> 44:28.240]  They don't give you the burpees, but krill oil is the best and it'll give you the damn
[44:28.240 --> 44:29.240]  burps.
[44:29.240 --> 44:30.240]  And I'm sorry.
[44:30.240 --> 44:31.600]  You want something like this, you don't get stuff for free.
[44:31.600 --> 44:32.600]  The krill is hallucinogenic.
[44:32.600 --> 44:33.600]  It's so good.
[44:33.600 --> 44:34.600]  In my view.
[44:34.600 --> 44:36.840]  I'm not making a medical statement here, but let me tell you something.
[44:36.840 --> 44:39.680]  I eat five camperels of krill oil before I go to bed.
[44:39.680 --> 44:43.200]  I'm seeing Santa Claus that night.
[44:43.200 --> 44:50.680]  So your brain is made basically out of what fish oil is.

[48:09.880 --> 48:12.400]  You won't stop human destiny.
[48:12.400 --> 48:16.240]  You're only here to test us and the faithful will prevail.
[48:16.240 --> 48:20.000]  I'm going to give the number off, we're going to have open phones the next hour and play
[48:20.000 --> 48:22.480]  a bunch of clips, get to a bunch of news and stuff as it breaks here.
[48:22.480 --> 48:26.880]  I've got so much to get to, so much I haven't even mentioned, it's insane.
[48:26.880 --> 48:33.800]  But the globalists failed because they have a bunch of followers and a bunch of cowards
[48:33.800 --> 48:40.560]  and a bunch of scum and because everything they built was built on a house of sand with
[48:40.560 --> 48:50.640]  a high tide of liberty coming in to a boot and the water and the waves and the wind blew
[48:50.640 --> 48:59.440]  away their little castles made of sand that fall into the sea eventually to quote Jim
[48:59.440 --> 49:00.440]  Hendricks.
[49:00.440 --> 49:03.800]  Oh, but that's the bad news.
[49:03.800 --> 49:06.280]  They're not stopping.
[49:06.280 --> 49:13.280]  They're swearing in the committees run by Maxine Waters to kill the economy and to harass
[49:13.280 --> 49:15.040]  and threaten companies to not move here.
[49:15.040 --> 49:18.720]  She's actually said that and she's actually run a lot of them off.
[49:18.720 --> 49:19.960]  What a horrible person.
[49:19.960 --> 49:24.280]  I mean, we have people working against us, trying to collapse the borders, trying to
[49:24.280 --> 49:28.520]  break up our families saying our pro-american president is a Russian agent trying to shut
[49:28.520 --> 49:30.920]  down the free press.
[49:30.920 --> 49:36.240]  They've passed bills in what a couple states, they're signing bills and others to kill babies
[49:36.240 --> 49:37.640]  after they're born.
[49:37.640 --> 49:39.760]  That's in the news today.
[49:39.760 --> 49:44.480]  North Carolina had a bill to say if a baby's born and it doesn't die on the abortion, you'll
[49:44.480 --> 49:47.720]  keep it alive and the governor said, no, we're going to kill it.
[49:47.720 --> 49:49.080]  That's killing after they're born.
[49:49.080 --> 49:51.720]  So they're always moving the gold post, man.
[49:51.720 --> 49:53.760]  Case for killing granny.
[49:53.760 --> 49:54.760]  Kill that baby.
[49:54.760 --> 49:59.240]  So they've been teaching for 30 years in colleges that you should kill children up to three
[49:59.240 --> 50:03.080]  of the state besides their future isn't good.
[50:03.080 --> 50:04.440]  Even the child's quote depressed.
[50:04.440 --> 50:05.440]  Let's just kill them.
[50:05.440 --> 50:09.280]  See, so they kill them mentally with the autism and then they tell the parents, you know,
[50:09.280 --> 50:13.600]  it's too expensive because right now it's one in 58's got autism, it'll soon be one
[50:13.600 --> 50:14.600]  in three.
[50:14.600 --> 50:19.960]  It was one in 35,000, just 30 something years ago, and it'll be like, well, you know, make
[50:19.960 --> 50:21.080]  the decision.
[50:21.080 --> 50:23.880]  We're killing your son because it's boys, right?
[50:23.880 --> 50:28.160]  You know, they're targeting those special thing in the vaccine, the thing they're going
[50:28.160 --> 50:34.240]  to give you a little treaty weedy, nothing like a treaty weedy for your boy.
[50:34.240 --> 50:39.840]  So we're going to cover all that too.
[50:39.840 --> 50:45.920]  Well, you said the globalists do hostile, I hate you, but I don't do it for my hate
[50:45.920 --> 50:46.920]  of you.
[50:46.920 --> 50:52.920]  I do it for my love of all you out there, humble, good, well-meaning, strong people that
[50:52.920 --> 51:00.040]  I salute.
[51:00.040 --> 51:08.920]  I would never have been this close to God without all this adversity and only now do
[51:08.920 --> 51:10.440]  I realize how real the Bible is.
[51:10.440 --> 51:13.360]  It's so true.
[51:13.360 --> 51:21.600]  You know, the world hates Christ, and the world's going to hate those of you that have
[51:21.600 --> 51:25.960]  Christ in you, like our unborn children.
[51:25.960 --> 51:30.440]  The system hates women more than anything because they're so powerful and magical.
[51:30.440 --> 51:31.440]  They want to own them.
[51:31.440 --> 51:34.040]  They want to run them and they're their friend.
[51:34.040 --> 51:38.720]  They'll take care of you.
[51:38.720 --> 51:42.720]  But then Candace Owens found out it was the left posing as white supremacist, threatening
[51:42.720 --> 51:48.040]  her to get control of her social network, and then she went from a leftist overnight
[51:48.040 --> 51:53.040]  to a free mind, and that's all I want.
[51:53.040 --> 51:59.600]  All I want is for people to be free because I have children, and I want them to grow up
[51:59.600 --> 52:06.000]  in a future with your children that are free, and I want their great, great grandchildren
[52:06.000 --> 52:13.280]  to be free, and to be able to make the decisions about the destiny they want.
[52:13.280 --> 52:20.840]  But the clear and present danger is the Democratic Party, who are not the Democratic Party of
[52:20.840 --> 52:26.120]  Thomas Jefferson, they are the globalist party, and you know, that's the thing about
[52:26.120 --> 52:27.120]  the Democrats.
[52:27.120 --> 52:33.160]  Did you know it was the Democrats who worked with British intelligence to start the Civil
[52:33.160 --> 52:37.560]  War and who wanted to break the country up and have their own nation?
[52:37.560 --> 52:45.000]  And again, I had ancestors that were colonels and generals in the Confederacy, and you name
[52:45.000 --> 52:46.000]  it.
[52:46.000 --> 52:47.720]  So this is not a debate about north versus south.
[52:47.720 --> 52:48.880]  Both sides had grievances.
[52:48.880 --> 52:49.880]  It wasn't about slavery.
[52:49.880 --> 52:51.200]  I know all that.
[52:51.200 --> 52:55.600]  But the south got suckered into it by British intelligence 30 years before Andrew Jackson
[52:55.600 --> 52:58.760]  as president, who was a southerner, stopped it.
[52:58.760 --> 53:03.920]  The founder of Texas was thrown out of office as governor.
[53:03.920 --> 53:09.480]  He'd been president, then governor, Sam Houston.
[53:09.480 --> 53:11.320]  They almost killed him through the amount of Houston's.
[53:11.320 --> 53:14.680]  He said, you're being shut up by powerful global forces.
[53:14.680 --> 53:18.600]  The North got 10 times the industry and five times the men.
[53:18.600 --> 53:21.040]  We'll beat them for the first year.
[53:21.040 --> 53:24.920]  You'll kill our best men, and then they're going to sack and burn everything.
[53:24.920 --> 53:27.800]  And they said, you get out of here, you son of a bitch.
[53:27.800 --> 53:28.800]  We know best.
[53:28.800 --> 53:30.160]  We're going to war.
[53:30.160 --> 53:31.720]  And you saw what happened.
[53:31.720 --> 53:33.880]  I read a whole book with his letters in it.
[53:33.880 --> 53:34.880]  I forget the name of it.
[53:34.880 --> 53:37.280]  Like 20 years ago, it made me cry.
[53:37.280 --> 53:39.920]  Sam Houston was a mountain of a man.
[53:39.920 --> 53:42.200]  He was what Davy Crockett wishes he was.
[53:42.200 --> 53:43.200]  He was the real Davy Crockett.
[53:43.200 --> 53:48.480]  He had like 10 arrows sticking out of him, like kill like 20, you know, engines to use
[53:48.480 --> 53:51.320]  that term of the time with a hatchet of Indians worshiped him.
[53:51.320 --> 53:53.320]  He was like a killing machine.
[53:53.320 --> 53:57.000]  And there he was as an old man telling Texas, don't do this, don't join it.
[53:57.000 --> 53:58.280]  You're crazy.
[53:58.280 --> 53:59.880]  It's a British intelligence setup.
[53:59.880 --> 54:01.720]  My God, don't do it.
[54:01.720 --> 54:04.200]  Listen to what Andrew Jackson said.
[54:04.200 --> 54:14.240]  He sent him, Andrew Jackson sent him to found Texas with my ancestors, or the treasurers
[54:14.240 --> 54:16.640]  of Texas, because they could be trusted.
[54:16.640 --> 54:23.840]  And it just blows my mind to watch these betrayals over and over again and to watch
[54:23.840 --> 54:27.520]  just suckered into this over and over again.
[54:27.520 --> 54:31.560]  And they're trying to cause a civil war again, these bastards.
[54:31.560 --> 54:35.600]  It just never ends.
[54:35.600 --> 54:43.840]  And I mean, the Republicans are perfect, but we formed an insurrection into the globalist
[54:43.840 --> 54:48.680]  operation through the Republicans.
[54:48.680 --> 54:54.520]  And we have been kicking their ass and they don't know what to do, but the bad news is
[54:54.520 --> 54:55.920]  the Democrats are digging in.
[54:55.920 --> 54:57.040]  They're not going to stop.
[54:57.040 --> 54:58.040]  They're going to obstruct.
[54:58.040 --> 54:59.040]  They're going to sabotage.
[54:59.040 --> 55:00.800]  They're going to get, they're going to commit more crimes.
[55:00.800 --> 55:04.320]  They're going to do more just small at stage events.
[55:04.320 --> 55:07.600]  And you just can't sit there and let them commit these crimes.
[55:07.600 --> 55:09.040]  This is not a government.
[55:09.040 --> 55:10.400]  This is a group of criminals.
[55:10.400 --> 55:18.640]  We're going to go to break the toll-free number to join us is 877-789-2539-877-789, Alex.
[55:18.640 --> 55:22.840]  First-time callers on the Mueller report, what you think is coming next.
[55:22.840 --> 55:27.960]  That's the topic we're covering, 877-789-Alex.
[55:27.960 --> 55:29.800]  And I haven't plugged any of this hour.
[55:29.800 --> 55:35.760]  Look, it's simple and God always comes through, but you know, I sell 300 t-shirts a day with
[55:35.760 --> 55:38.120]  this special and we're making like $5 on them.
[55:38.120 --> 55:39.120]  That's not going to pay the bills.
[55:39.120 --> 55:41.440]  The ban with the loan costs that every day.
[55:41.440 --> 55:44.680]  And I've gotten this trap that marketers, I don't have a degree in marketing, but marketers
[55:44.680 --> 55:49.120]  told me years ago, they said, you keep only marketing stuff up 100% and then you discount
[55:49.120 --> 55:50.120]  it.
[55:50.120 --> 55:51.400]  People are going to expect sales all the time.
[55:51.400 --> 55:52.920]  They're looking about on the sale.
[55:52.920 --> 55:56.320]  And then yeah, you move a lot of volume, but you don't make a lot of money.
[55:56.320 --> 55:57.840]  You need to stop doing sales all the time.
[55:57.840 --> 55:59.160]  Well, I got myself in that trap.
[55:59.160 --> 56:00.160]  That's just the way it is.
[56:00.160 --> 56:07.320]  50% off all the apparel, ball caps, t-shirts, go buy a bunch of it and give it as a gift
[56:07.320 --> 56:15.440]  or wear it yourself or go give it to the local Salvation Army or Goodwill.
[56:15.440 --> 56:17.280]  It's a walking billboard.
[56:17.280 --> 56:20.320]  Give it to your friends, your family, your neighbors, a Molan lobby, attorney response
[56:20.320 --> 56:21.320]  team shirt.
[56:21.320 --> 56:22.320]  You meet like-minded people.
[56:22.320 --> 56:23.320]  This is how you do it.
[56:23.320 --> 56:25.800]  You do this once a year, 50% off apparel.
[56:25.800 --> 56:26.800]  We've got DNA force.
[56:26.800 --> 56:27.880]  You know, it's close to selling out.
[56:27.880 --> 56:31.920]  I'm still offering the 20% off, read all the amazing reviews, DNA force.
[56:31.920 --> 56:33.520]  We have the best food deal ever.
[56:33.520 --> 56:37.800]  It's my Patriot supply, private label so I can go at cost and get around their contracts
[56:37.800 --> 56:38.800]  and they allow me to do that.
[56:38.800 --> 56:43.840]  It's a two-week food supply and a very nice big plastic tote container.
[56:43.840 --> 56:48.520]  All each meal shield itself, two-week food supply at cost $67.
[56:48.520 --> 56:51.640]  That's a loss leader for them because they let me make like $10.
[56:51.640 --> 56:55.040]  They're selling it at a loss leader so you see how great their storeable food is.
[56:55.040 --> 57:00.600]  Great Alexa Pure Breeze, four-stage ion filter, $50 off.
[57:00.600 --> 57:03.720]  Many competitors cost $500, it usually costs $250.
[57:03.720 --> 57:04.920]  It's $200 right now.
[57:04.920 --> 57:06.520]  That is a great deal.

[58:09.200 --> 58:13.800]  because you've taken action with hashtag Alex Jones.

[58:38.680 --> 58:42.080]  That's the rallying cry to restore the First Amendment.
[58:42.080 --> 58:50.760]  Creativity and the dynamic human spirit that refuses to submit.
[58:50.760 --> 58:55.640]  As the years go by, it gets harder and harder to keep up with your body's nutritional needs.
[58:55.640 --> 59:00.080]  With changes in diet, unnatural ingredients, and stress, you may not be able to get all

[01:00:14.200 --> 01:00:39.200]  My news for Friday from 11 a.m. 3 p.m. We're here live, David Nights on 8 a.m.
[01:00:39.200 --> 01:00:46.200]  4 p.m. Central every day, great guys, so good to know them.
[01:00:46.200 --> 01:00:52.800]  But, you know, being in this fight, I hate myself sometimes when I want to say something
[01:00:52.800 --> 01:00:53.800]  or do something better.
[01:00:53.800 --> 01:00:57.800]  I get really mad at myself, even though I really respect David, and he's smarter than
[01:00:57.800 --> 01:00:58.800]  I am many ways.
[01:00:58.800 --> 01:01:02.600]  I really respect Owen, he's more passionate and smarter many ways.
[01:01:02.600 --> 01:01:07.200]  I'll be watching them when they're doing their shows, getting mad at him, like you should
[01:01:07.200 --> 01:01:08.200]  do this, you should do that.
[01:01:08.200 --> 01:01:10.120]  And it has nothing to do with them.
[01:01:10.120 --> 01:01:17.120]  I'm projecting my own boiling, it's like a dog chewing on a cage that it's entrapped
[01:01:17.120 --> 01:01:21.600]  in, it's just biting at it, and there's that frustration and we can't let the enemy
[01:01:21.600 --> 01:01:27.200]  wear us down, we cannot overheat, we have to just trust in God and just keep working
[01:01:27.200 --> 01:01:31.800]  and just keep focusing, and we're going to win.
[01:01:31.800 --> 01:01:36.800]  And most nations don't get this type of quick reprieve, we're not there yet.
[01:01:36.800 --> 01:01:44.000]  God's showing us, listen, you've been given special dispensation, you've been given the
[01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:46.600]  golden ticket, but you have to take the birthright.
[01:01:46.600 --> 01:01:51.200]  It's just like the prophets would tell Israel every time Israel turned against God and became
[01:01:51.200 --> 01:01:52.200]  wicked.
[01:01:52.200 --> 01:01:56.000]  The devil was focusing on Israel because Israel had the birthright, so Israel did a lot of
[01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:57.840]  wicked things.
[01:01:57.840 --> 01:02:04.960]  Not because Israel was evil at heart, but because Israel had the birthright, the devil
[01:02:04.960 --> 01:02:10.000]  was focusing all his power on them.
[01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:18.360]  And make no mistake, America is under attack from without them, from within.
[01:02:18.360 --> 01:02:23.480]  And we don't say that as victims, we say that as overcomers, we have to be honest with ourselves
[01:02:23.480 --> 01:02:24.480]  about that.
[01:02:24.480 --> 01:02:28.440]  I see Chris in Minnesota, I'll go to first when we come back from break, New World Order,
[01:02:28.440 --> 01:02:35.760]  Globalist, set back 20 years, yes, I feel like I should be popping champagne.
[01:02:35.760 --> 01:02:40.360]  I feel like I should be celebrating except, okay, they didn't totally rout us this time.
[01:02:40.360 --> 01:02:45.560]  We fought back from the grave.
[01:02:45.560 --> 01:02:50.960]  And now they're reforming to come at us, which makes these victories that much sweeter, but
[01:02:50.960 --> 01:02:53.040]  also that much more painful.
[01:02:53.040 --> 01:02:57.080]  Because when America's come back from the dead that many times, when we've been given
[01:02:57.080 --> 01:03:03.680]  providence and God's discernment, so many times, it makes it that much more precious.
[01:03:03.680 --> 01:03:09.880]  You know, it's like a child you have that gets sick when their little and almost dies.
[01:03:09.880 --> 01:03:13.800]  You may have five or six other children, but that one little daughter, that one little
[01:03:13.800 --> 01:03:19.720]  son that almost died, and that you stayed up with all night, all those weeks, you'll
[01:03:19.720 --> 01:03:23.320]  always love them more than the others.
[01:03:23.320 --> 01:03:30.560]  Think about that.
[01:03:30.560 --> 01:03:35.760]  That's the prodigal son.
[01:03:35.760 --> 01:03:37.720]  Firstborn son says, I never did anything wrong.
[01:03:37.720 --> 01:03:38.720]  I always did what I was told.
[01:03:38.720 --> 01:03:43.240]  I was steadfast, and you're spending all your money and your time welcoming back to this
[01:03:43.240 --> 01:03:46.520]  other son that's been gone for 10 years and took his birthright early.
[01:03:46.520 --> 01:03:49.320]  And it was a total thug and an embarrassment to us.
[01:03:49.320 --> 01:03:52.600]  And now you just welcome him back and have the biggest party we've ever had and give
[01:03:52.600 --> 01:03:56.280]  all the employees bonuses and kill the best cow we've gotten.
[01:03:56.280 --> 01:03:57.280]  What the hell?
[01:03:57.280 --> 01:04:04.560]  And the father looks at him and says, Can you imagine what I do for you?
[01:04:04.560 --> 01:04:08.120]  This is the failed son, means that much.
[01:04:08.120 --> 01:04:11.920]  It's expected that you're going to perform.
[01:04:11.920 --> 01:04:17.520]  I love you 10 times more than that failed son.
[01:04:17.520 --> 01:04:25.320]  This is a celebration that we didn't lose this one, but you are leader, and you will
[01:04:25.320 --> 01:04:33.000]  carry on the house, and so you don't need little petty parties or medals or to be praised
[01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:36.640]  by the system for doing the right thing.
[01:04:36.640 --> 01:04:42.000]  You're the firstborn and you're in charge because you are in charge.
[01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:48.240]  It's this fallen son that we have to rejoice came back because we almost lost him.
[01:04:48.240 --> 01:04:58.560]  Don't you understand now, today whether it's your calls or straight ahead.
[01:04:58.560 --> 01:05:02.400]  Our grandparents, the great grandparents, know that they can food during the falls they'd
[01:05:02.400 --> 01:05:03.800]  have it during the winter.
[01:05:03.800 --> 01:05:07.560]  And that's what I'm talking about at M4WordsTour.com.

[01:06:22.120 --> 01:06:35.720]  See, the generals gathered in their masses, just like witches at black masses.
[01:06:35.720 --> 01:06:45.960]  In the fields, the body's burning, as the war machine keeps turning, just like witches
[01:06:45.960 --> 01:06:59.240]  at black masses, evil minds that plot destruction, sorcerers of death construction, how do you
[01:06:59.240 --> 01:07:02.360]  really kill somebody?
[01:07:02.360 --> 01:07:07.160]  You kill them softly, where they never know what hit them, bottom of the hour, I'm going
[01:07:07.160 --> 01:07:13.960]  to hit that, emergency, public service announcement that if you care about yourself, you care
[01:07:13.960 --> 01:07:19.240]  about your neighbors, you care about the future, you care about your pension funds, you'll
[01:07:19.240 --> 01:07:21.040]  want to tune in for that.
[01:07:21.040 --> 01:07:29.800]  See, there's different stories out there about the round that they produced for the
[01:07:29.800 --> 01:07:42.080]  Colt M16, what is that, the 556 or 223, but they said that it would wound people instead
[01:07:42.080 --> 01:07:45.360]  of killing them and that would sap more of the enemy's resources.
[01:07:45.360 --> 01:07:53.200]  Now, whether that story is true or not, that gives you a little bird's eye view and a window
[01:07:53.200 --> 01:07:57.840]  into the global thinking, because whether that's true or not, and historians debate
[01:07:57.840 --> 01:08:02.280]  back and forth, I'm really not even a novice when it comes to gun history, I know how to
[01:08:02.280 --> 01:08:10.560]  shoot them, but that's about it, I know I hit the target, but the whole nomenclature
[01:08:10.560 --> 01:08:20.480]  of it I'm not really up to snuff on, but you see, soft kills are a real thing and folks
[01:08:20.480 --> 01:08:27.920]  should know about it, because even if you're not having children, all of the mentally retarded
[01:08:27.920 --> 01:08:32.920]  and brain damaged children that we're having to pay for and deal with are something that
[01:08:32.920 --> 01:08:35.920]  can be fixed real quick.
[01:08:35.920 --> 01:08:41.440]  But see, there's a project going on that the globalist are panicking and Trump becomes
[01:08:41.440 --> 01:08:46.760]  full president and gets into that they're going to get turned around and stopped.
[01:08:46.760 --> 01:08:53.800]  Oh, the Chinese don't have this autism problem, the Russians don't have it.
[01:08:53.800 --> 01:08:59.040]  By the way, any country that doesn't use glyphosate doesn't have it.
[01:08:59.040 --> 01:09:05.160]  You're probably going to say, wait, I thought vaccines did it.
[01:09:05.160 --> 01:09:10.720]  It's called binary weapons and then they've got other weapons that aren't just two different
[01:09:10.720 --> 01:09:15.680]  systems that together create the compound that kills you, they have weapons sometimes
[01:09:15.680 --> 01:09:23.760]  that up to six before they start breaking down on having the desired effect.
[01:09:23.760 --> 01:09:35.160]  Vaccines are a binary adjuvant trigger for fluoride plaques and plaques associated with
[01:09:35.160 --> 01:09:36.680]  glyphosate.
[01:09:36.680 --> 01:09:44.680]  The body builds up and blocks and then the vaccine triggers an autoimmune response that
[01:09:44.680 --> 01:09:50.920]  causes swelling in the brain that then breaks the barrier and then the full dose is delivered
[01:09:50.920 --> 01:09:53.920]  to a binary weapon.
[01:09:53.920 --> 01:10:01.200]  So if you don't want to be changing your son's diapers until you go to the nursing home
[01:10:01.200 --> 01:10:08.000]  and he goes and gets euthanized, you might want to listen to me because I do this in
[01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:14.480]  a cold, evil voice because that's the enemy's intent for you and your family and you need
[01:10:14.480 --> 01:10:20.040]  to know they're spooky and they're bad and they're the enemy and the average doctors
[01:10:20.040 --> 01:10:25.960]  can compartmentalize that doesn't know about that, so you're going to have to be a leader
[01:10:25.960 --> 01:10:26.960]  now.
[01:10:26.960 --> 01:10:32.040]  That's coming up, but I've already burned part of this segment.
[01:10:32.040 --> 01:10:37.640]  Last segment of the hour, I'm going to hit it and we're going to talk about something
[01:10:37.640 --> 01:10:41.000]  that can you stop them breaking the border?
[01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:44.120]  Can you stop crackheads that want to smoke crack?
[01:10:44.120 --> 01:10:47.800]  Can you stop Muslims wanting to blow themselves up?
[01:10:47.800 --> 01:10:52.840]  Maybe not, but you could talk to your neighbors, you could bring them the vaccine insert, you
[01:10:52.840 --> 01:10:57.200]  could spend some time on that instead of fantasy football or getting drunk down at the bar
[01:10:57.200 --> 01:11:00.600]  with your buddies that are all fake people and giggling and laughing at each other when
[01:11:00.600 --> 01:11:04.040]  none of them matters.
[01:11:04.040 --> 01:11:08.560]  You could do all that and I know most of you are doing that, but I'm talking to new listeners
[01:11:08.560 --> 01:11:12.680]  that tune in and they go, man, Jones is the biggest comedian in the world.
[01:11:12.680 --> 01:11:18.560]  He's the funniest guy we've ever heard.
[01:11:18.560 --> 01:11:26.080]  There's millions of yous on YouTube of me talking about the governor of Virginia discussing
[01:11:26.080 --> 01:11:33.280]  keeping babies alive and killing them after they're born and I say, keep them comfortable.
[01:11:33.280 --> 01:11:38.720]  Little flesh ball.
[01:11:38.720 --> 01:11:42.280]  And people think it's funny.
[01:11:42.280 --> 01:11:48.400]  I only illustrated it because that's how the governor talks and that's how sick it is.
[01:11:48.400 --> 01:11:50.280]  I didn't do it because it's funny.
[01:11:50.280 --> 01:11:58.400]  Now you can laugh all day and I'm not saying you're bad if you think it's funny, but this
[01:11:58.400 --> 01:12:02.520]  is an entertainment.
[01:12:02.520 --> 01:12:08.560]  Now if you think you're safe when they can kill newborn babies and we got these people
[01:12:08.560 --> 01:12:19.360]  like this monster walking around above ground, you don't have any instincts.
[01:12:19.360 --> 01:12:27.520]  The fact that the Democratic Party is publicly in every state they control getting laws passed
[01:12:27.520 --> 01:12:40.400]  to kill babies after they're born shows that they think you're in a trance.
[01:12:40.400 --> 01:12:44.520]  Anybody could investigate this sack of garbage and the biomedic companies that have given
[01:12:44.520 --> 01:12:45.520]  him money.
[01:12:45.520 --> 01:12:48.120]  I went and looked it up.
[01:12:48.120 --> 01:12:53.680]  Guess where this old medical doctor that just so happens to be a pediatric doctor
[01:12:53.680 --> 01:12:57.640]  got his funding from, oh, it's real funny.
[01:12:57.640 --> 01:13:01.440]  Gee, he wants to keep babies alive and harvest their organs.
[01:13:01.440 --> 01:13:09.320]  They get more money doing that, keep them alive, longer to get a higher price than the
[01:13:09.320 --> 01:13:10.320]  organ.
[01:13:10.320 --> 01:13:11.320]  You got them right there on the spot.
[01:13:11.320 --> 01:13:15.440]  There might not be a buyer right away with some fresh goods.
[01:13:15.440 --> 01:13:23.200]  We take the blood, the organs, and we take the skin, but it's all right.
[01:13:23.200 --> 01:13:31.640]  That's a Southern-loving voice and there's nothing wrong with Southern-loving, isn't it?
[01:13:31.640 --> 01:13:36.240]  After all, we love the children.
[01:13:36.240 --> 01:13:41.720]  But another governor just vetoed a law that if a baby's already born, they can't kill
[01:13:41.720 --> 01:13:42.720]  it.
[01:13:42.720 --> 01:13:48.680]  There's already laws saying you can't kill that baby, but it's all a big power grab
[01:13:48.680 --> 01:13:53.220]  by the doctors, a power grab by the hospital, by the medical groups, and they celebrate
[01:13:53.220 --> 01:13:57.400]  sign these bills in New York, you name it, to kill the babies after they're born.
[01:13:57.400 --> 01:14:00.840]  Then they pass laws in North Carolina saying you won't do it, and the governor does the
[01:14:00.840 --> 01:14:02.720]  mind control and says, no, we will.
[01:14:02.720 --> 01:14:05.800]  There's already laws on murder.
[01:14:05.800 --> 01:14:10.560]  There's already laws on that, but people are like, but it's a doctor, but it's a medical
[01:14:10.560 --> 01:14:11.560]  center.
[01:14:11.560 --> 01:14:13.960]  The police are like, well, are they allowed to?
[01:14:13.960 --> 01:14:19.800]  You see, they're using their white coats and their station, like the Nazis did.
[01:14:19.800 --> 01:14:25.320]  The first sterilizations, executions were by doctors in the Third Reich in 1934.
[01:14:25.320 --> 01:14:32.960]  They're using that as the wedge, as the camel's nose under the tent flap, as the boot in the
[01:14:32.960 --> 01:14:40.520]  door to begin the whole operation.
[01:14:40.520 --> 01:14:42.800]  And the mother decides if she wants it.
[01:14:42.800 --> 01:14:46.960]  If she wants it, we resuscitate, that's a legal term for them in bioethics.
[01:14:46.960 --> 01:14:52.480]  It's already alive, but we decide if it leads to live on.
[01:14:52.480 --> 01:15:00.280]  And then we say, resuscitate or not, if we don't resuscitate, the little blood bag is
[01:15:00.280 --> 01:15:07.640]  taken back and kept comfortable for all those orders for the liver, the lungs, the kidneys,
[01:15:07.640 --> 01:15:16.280]  the spleen, and then the fat, and the blood, and the skin, and it's all rendered down and
[01:15:16.280 --> 01:15:17.280]  sold.
[01:15:17.280 --> 01:15:25.760]  Then I get a big house and a big pool, and so much money, and we don't need to get the
[01:15:25.760 --> 01:15:28.840]  police or the government involved or fathers.
[01:15:28.840 --> 01:15:37.560]  He says men shouldn't be involved, it's the mothers with the doctors that we'll decide.
[01:15:37.560 --> 01:15:44.560]  While your woman's drugged up, we get her to sign the agreement, and then we take that
[01:15:44.560 --> 01:15:48.560]  little creature, and we got some real good.
[01:15:48.560 --> 01:15:52.680]  We'll be back with your phone calls, I'm Alex Jones.

[01:16:03.840 --> 01:16:06.800]  Forget bunkers, you're not a live underground gopher.

[01:21:17.400 --> 01:21:38.420]  Alright, I'm going to go to your calls, bam, bam, bam, right now.
[01:21:38.420 --> 01:21:43.720]  And then coming up, we're going to get into all over the country, Democrats are passing
[01:21:43.720 --> 01:21:46.600]  laws to kill babies after they're born.
[01:21:46.600 --> 01:21:50.040]  And law enforcement is asking, well, how late could it be a 75-year-old man?
[01:21:50.040 --> 01:21:51.040]  Democrats are like, no.
[01:21:51.040 --> 01:21:54.080]  If the hospital says you're a baby and you're 75, they're going to kill you.
[01:21:54.080 --> 01:21:55.840]  I'm not joking.
[01:21:55.840 --> 01:22:02.320]  So it's hospitals making law, it's eugenics, it's population reduction, it's euthanasia
[01:22:02.320 --> 01:22:03.960]  or this.
[01:22:03.960 --> 01:22:08.640]  And so here it is, they're making their move, the XDEA head, U.S. border collapsing, we'll
[01:22:08.640 --> 01:22:09.960]  get into that.
[01:22:09.960 --> 01:22:13.600]  Proposal to Texas law would demand safety studies for vaccines.
[01:22:13.600 --> 01:22:17.200]  We didn't know they didn't have safety studies, I'm going to get into all of that.
[01:22:17.200 --> 01:22:21.880]  Top progressive pundits and mainstream Democrats are worried about Bernie Sanders winning the
[01:22:21.880 --> 01:22:23.880]  White House in 2020.
[01:22:23.880 --> 01:22:29.080]  And turning us into Venezuela, I will do that for you.
[01:22:29.080 --> 01:22:34.840]  Never had a real job, but I run things so that is how it is.
[01:22:34.840 --> 01:22:37.680]  That is all coming up and more.
[01:22:37.680 --> 01:22:45.800]  But right now, we've got Bear in Wisconsin or Washington, we've got Burger in California,
[01:22:45.800 --> 01:22:50.560]  we've got Danny in Virginia, Jack in Indiana, Jimmy in Maine, Frank in Michigan, Jacob in
[01:22:50.560 --> 01:23:00.080]  Kansas, Gary in Virginia, Brian in Pennsylvania, Mark in Colorado, David in Florida, and many,
[01:23:00.080 --> 01:23:01.240]  many, many others.
[01:23:01.240 --> 01:23:05.920]  And so I think the best way to start this is who's been holding the longest.
[01:23:05.920 --> 01:23:15.200]  Let's go ahead without further ado with no drumroll, and let's go ahead and talk to Frank
[01:23:15.200 --> 01:23:16.200]  in Michigan.
[01:23:16.200 --> 01:23:17.360]  Frank, thanks for calling.
[01:23:17.360 --> 01:23:18.360]  Go ahead.
[01:23:18.360 --> 01:23:25.200]  Hey, I wanted to comment about the future of the Info Wars operation.
[01:23:25.200 --> 01:23:29.800]  And the comment that I have is that you have some really strong people that are working
[01:23:29.800 --> 01:23:34.320]  for you now, but you had some people in the past that were as well.
[01:23:34.320 --> 01:23:40.640]  And I'm talking right now like of Greg Rief, and I think that he should be the model going
[01:23:40.640 --> 01:23:47.200]  forward for the rest of your reporters, the freelancers, the Caitlyn, the Millies.
[01:23:47.200 --> 01:23:48.880]  Enough of the troll video.
[01:23:48.880 --> 01:23:55.800]  It's time for Info Wars to return to originating journalism like you were back in the day.
[01:23:55.800 --> 01:24:03.320]  Not having a political bent, but being far more objective and educating.
[01:24:03.320 --> 01:24:07.800]  And I think if you guys wouldn't have hacked out in the last election for Trump, that you
[01:24:07.800 --> 01:24:12.480]  probably wouldn't be in the crosshairs, that you probably wouldn't have been looked at.
[01:24:12.480 --> 01:24:13.480]  Well, I better not.
[01:24:13.480 --> 01:24:16.320]  I went out of the crosshairs, so I better abandon Trump.
[01:24:16.320 --> 01:24:18.400]  Man, we're getting nationalist elected.
[01:24:18.400 --> 01:24:19.760]  Doesn't mean Trump's perfect.
[01:24:19.760 --> 01:24:22.360]  We finally got somebody that'll do what they say they're going to do.
[01:24:22.360 --> 01:24:25.640]  I'm supporting nationalists getting elected all over the world here.
[01:24:25.640 --> 01:24:27.800]  So I want to be in the crosshairs.
[01:24:27.800 --> 01:24:32.320]  I mean, you understand that I'm not trying to get out of the crosshairs.
[01:24:32.320 --> 01:24:36.280]  See, because they announce how I failed, how I'm being taken off all this stuff like,
[01:24:36.280 --> 01:24:39.280]  oh, look, he's a failure, but oh, God, I better not support him.
[01:24:39.280 --> 01:24:40.520]  I'll get banned.
[01:24:40.520 --> 01:24:42.240]  This is called leadership.
[01:24:42.240 --> 01:24:47.560]  I am not pleased they're trying to censor us and blocking us in ways, but I'm pleased
[01:24:47.560 --> 01:24:50.000]  that we were so effective they did it.
[01:24:50.000 --> 01:24:54.600]  So I hired Gregory's, and I wish I had more money to hire more people.
[01:24:54.600 --> 01:24:58.360]  And so we're doing a lot of things, a lot of reporters and a lot of stuff here.
[01:24:58.360 --> 01:25:02.400]  And I'm not mad at you calling up and saying what you want to hear, what you want to see,
[01:25:02.400 --> 01:25:07.160]  but at the same time, like we, Greg Reese is awesome and he makes great videos and he's
[01:25:07.160 --> 01:25:08.400]  here.
[01:25:08.400 --> 01:25:10.200]  And so see what I mean.
[01:25:10.200 --> 01:25:12.840]  I mean, how you're like telling me what I need to do more of.
[01:25:12.840 --> 01:25:13.840]  We're doing it.
[01:25:13.840 --> 01:25:14.840]  Right.
[01:25:14.840 --> 01:25:15.840]  And that's awesome.
[01:25:15.840 --> 01:25:20.760]  And I wanted to, and I know that this, I'm not trying to get on your nerves here, but
[01:25:20.760 --> 01:25:24.920]  I'm not getting on my nerves, but let me hold on just a second.
[01:25:24.920 --> 01:25:31.960]  You can tell me what you want, Frank, but you say you might not have been in the crosshairs
[01:25:31.960 --> 01:25:36.280]  so much if you'd have been a little bit better.
[01:25:36.280 --> 01:25:39.480]  I'm not doing what I do to stay out of the crosshairs.
[01:25:39.480 --> 01:25:42.280]  I want you to get that mindset going here for you.
[01:25:42.280 --> 01:25:46.160]  I want to be in the crosshairs like John Hancock.
[01:25:46.160 --> 01:25:51.560]  Why do you think John Hancock on the Declaration of Independence, July 4th, 1776, signed his
[01:25:51.560 --> 01:25:54.080]  name five times bigger than all the other names?
[01:25:54.080 --> 01:25:55.680]  Why do you do that?
[01:25:55.680 --> 01:25:59.640]  Of course, he's trying to call attention to himself.
[01:25:59.640 --> 01:26:03.840]  Oh, oh, signing it was a death warrant.
[01:26:03.840 --> 01:26:05.720]  He was saying, I'm going over the top.
[01:26:05.720 --> 01:26:07.840]  I'm totally committed.
[01:26:07.840 --> 01:26:10.800]  Like that was a middle finger to the King of England.
[01:26:10.800 --> 01:26:13.200]  You know, the King of England was showing a copy of that.
[01:26:13.200 --> 01:26:15.720]  And the King of England said, who's John Hancock?
[01:26:15.720 --> 01:26:16.960]  He's number one to be killed.
[01:26:16.960 --> 01:26:19.440]  And John Hancock had some of his family killed.
[01:26:19.440 --> 01:26:20.440]  You name it.
[01:26:20.440 --> 01:26:21.440]  Lost everything he had.
[01:26:21.440 --> 01:26:22.640]  That's what this is all about, brother.
[01:26:22.640 --> 01:26:26.440]  So when you call up and say, hey, dude, you might not want to put yourself on the radar.
[01:26:26.440 --> 01:26:28.640]  I am John Hancock reborn.
[01:26:28.640 --> 01:26:29.640]  Understand?
[01:26:29.640 --> 01:26:31.640]  But it's not just putting yourself.
[01:26:31.640 --> 01:26:35.040]  Listen to me, Frank, do you understand me?
[01:26:35.040 --> 01:26:37.160]  I'm not mad at you criticizing me.
[01:26:37.160 --> 01:26:39.640]  I'm attacking the New York Times every day.
[01:26:39.640 --> 01:26:41.640]  I want you to know my spirit, Frank.
[01:26:41.640 --> 01:26:42.960]  I want you to understand it.
[01:26:42.960 --> 01:26:44.560]  I want you to learn it.
[01:26:44.560 --> 01:26:46.680]  I want to be in the crosshairs, Frank.
[01:26:46.680 --> 01:26:48.560]  I seek the crosshairs.
[01:26:48.560 --> 01:26:50.760]  I will follow it to the end.
[01:26:50.760 --> 01:26:56.360]  So please don't tell me about courses of action that lead me into the system being nice to
[01:26:56.360 --> 01:26:57.360]  me.
[01:26:57.360 --> 01:26:58.720]  I do not seek them to be nice to me.
[01:26:58.720 --> 01:27:00.360]  I seek war.
[01:27:00.360 --> 01:27:05.760]  I seek like John Paul Jones said, I only want the fastest and quickest and most deadly ships
[01:27:05.760 --> 01:27:08.000]  to lead me into action.
[01:27:08.000 --> 01:27:10.000]  Now do you understand, Frank?
[01:27:10.000 --> 01:27:13.280]  Geez, yes, I understand where you're coming from.
[01:27:13.280 --> 01:27:14.280]  Let me hear your war, Grel.
[01:27:14.280 --> 01:27:17.280]  Let me hear your war, Grel, Frank.
[01:27:17.280 --> 01:27:30.080]  Give me war, Frank.
[01:27:30.080 --> 01:27:33.720]  Steer me into war against these pedophiles and devil-like spirits.
[01:27:33.720 --> 01:27:35.120]  Give me war.
[01:27:35.120 --> 01:27:37.960]  I want to be in the crosshairs.
[01:27:37.960 --> 01:27:40.160]  Now you understand, don't you?
[01:27:40.160 --> 01:27:41.840]  What else would you like, Frank?
[01:27:41.840 --> 01:27:43.880]  What else would you like, Frank?
[01:27:43.880 --> 01:27:50.400]  Aaron Dyke, give us both of those guys' work a one-two knockout punch in just like the
[01:27:50.400 --> 01:27:51.400]  days of yesterday.
[01:27:51.400 --> 01:27:52.400]  Aaron Dyke.
[01:27:52.400 --> 01:27:53.640]  Aaron Dyke was a smart, nice guy.
[01:27:53.640 --> 01:27:54.640]  He quit.
[01:27:54.640 --> 01:27:55.880]  He went off with his girlfriend to do his own thing.
[01:27:55.880 --> 01:27:56.880]  Good for him.
[01:27:56.880 --> 01:27:59.160]  Again, you're not in the middle of this.
[01:27:59.160 --> 01:28:02.360]  You don't know what goes on behind the scenes here, but I hear you.
[01:28:02.360 --> 01:28:03.360]  You're right.
[01:28:03.360 --> 01:28:04.360]  I built this.
[01:28:04.360 --> 01:28:05.360]  I had a lot of reporters come through here.
[01:28:05.360 --> 01:28:06.600]  Most of them can't handle the pressure.
[01:28:06.600 --> 01:28:09.240]  I love them to death, okay?
[01:28:09.240 --> 01:28:10.600]  But you do not know what you speak, Frank.
[01:28:10.600 --> 01:28:12.080]  I appreciate your call.
[01:28:12.080 --> 01:28:15.680]  I wonder if we have more callers that can tell me when we come back how I stay out of
[01:28:15.680 --> 01:28:16.680]  the fight.
[01:28:16.680 --> 01:28:21.680]  You know, Alex, things may have gone a little bit better for you.
[01:28:21.680 --> 01:28:23.360]  Why don't I just go into Hillary Clinton, then?
[01:28:23.360 --> 01:28:27.600]  I bet I could be like the young Turks, or 50 times bigger.
[01:28:27.600 --> 01:28:34.520]  It's just the blindness, the spiritual blindness of saying to me, if you just played ball,
[01:28:34.520 --> 01:28:36.520]  you wouldn't be under attack.
[01:28:36.520 --> 01:28:37.520]  What?
[01:28:37.520 --> 01:28:38.520]  What?
[01:28:38.520 --> 01:28:49.520]  I just, I just, I, it's just bizarre to see how blind people are in fours.com tomorrow.
[01:28:49.520 --> 01:29:19.480]  It's just, it's just bizarre to see how blind people are in fours.com tomorrow.
[01:29:19.480 --> 01:29:21.480]  Our Black Rifle Real Estate Team is here to help.

[01:29:27.360 --> 01:29:31.120]  Most of you know that heart disease is the number one silent killer in the U.S.
[01:29:31.120 --> 01:29:35.880]  What if I told you for just 54.95 a month you could fight against heart disease naturally
[01:29:35.880 --> 01:29:37.800]  at Heart and Body Extract?
[01:29:37.800 --> 01:29:40.960]  We've been helping thousands of people get back to a healthier heart.
[01:29:40.960 --> 01:29:42.280]  Don't just take my word for it.

[01:29:54.800 --> 01:29:58.680]  Don't risk it when you can take charge of it.
[01:29:58.680 --> 01:30:01.760]  There are thousands of ideologies out there.
[01:30:01.760 --> 01:30:06.640]  Hundreds of different political systems and most of them are funded by the globalist.
[01:30:06.640 --> 01:30:09.240]  Infowars is truly the tip of the spear of the zeitgeist.
[01:30:09.240 --> 01:30:12.680]  That's why the globalists are obsessed with it, trying to shut it down.
[01:30:12.680 --> 01:30:14.280]  I didn't invent all this.
[01:30:14.280 --> 01:30:19.080]  I went and researched the Renaissance, Americana and what really works for humanity.
[01:30:19.080 --> 01:30:20.720]  And I'm simply trying to bring it back.
[01:30:20.720 --> 01:30:24.960]  And lo and behold, it's super popular like it's always been.
[01:30:24.960 --> 01:30:28.960]  That's why the globalists are trying to shut it down so desperately because we have the
[01:30:28.960 --> 01:30:32.840]  light in the dark of the night that sends chills at my spine.
[01:30:32.840 --> 01:30:37.360]  So whatever you do, continue to support yourself and Infowars by buying the great products
[01:30:37.360 --> 01:30:41.760]  at infowarsstore.com, by spreading the articles, by spreading the videos, and by praying for
[01:30:41.760 --> 01:30:46.360]  this operation and for praying for this nation and the world for peace and discernment.
[01:30:46.360 --> 01:30:50.320]  For myself and the whole Infowars family, I want to thank all of you for what you've
[01:30:50.320 --> 01:30:54.240]  done because without you, Infowars is nothing.
[01:30:54.240 --> 01:30:59.320]  You are the Infowars and I salute you.
[01:30:59.320 --> 01:31:00.760]  I want to say Brain Force is great.
[01:31:00.760 --> 01:31:02.760]  I want to say Turbo Force is amazing.
[01:31:02.760 --> 01:31:03.760]  It is.
[01:31:03.760 --> 01:31:08.240]  But if you took it with fish oil, it's like the fish oil is it.
[01:31:08.240 --> 01:31:09.600]  The fish oil is better than it.
[01:31:09.600 --> 01:31:11.480]  And that's an example of what I'm talking about.
[01:31:11.480 --> 01:31:17.040]  Fish oil is liquid energy, brain, body, heart, the cleanest, the best out there.
[01:31:17.040 --> 01:31:18.040]  You've got the children's.
[01:31:18.040 --> 01:31:19.040]  You've got the adults.
[01:31:19.040 --> 01:31:20.040]  You've got the krill oil.
[01:31:20.040 --> 01:31:23.920]  If you're going to get the full effect, the fish oil and the children's are really strong.
[01:31:23.920 --> 01:31:27.400]  They don't give you the burpees, but krill oil is the best and it'll give you the damn
[01:31:27.400 --> 01:31:28.400]  burps.
[01:31:28.400 --> 01:31:29.400]  And I'm just sorry.
[01:31:29.400 --> 01:31:30.640]  You want something like this, you don't get stuff for free.
[01:31:30.640 --> 01:31:31.640]  The krill is hallucinogenic.
[01:31:31.640 --> 01:31:32.640]  It's so good.
[01:31:32.640 --> 01:31:36.640]  In my view, I'm not a medical statement here, but let me tell you something, I eat five
[01:31:36.640 --> 01:31:42.200]  capillots of krill oil before I go to bed, I'm seeing Santa Claus that night.
[01:31:42.200 --> 01:31:49.720]  So your brain is made basically out of what fish oil is.
[01:31:49.720 --> 01:31:53.160]  So we don't make a big profit off of it, but you notice I just obsess because whatever
[01:31:53.160 --> 01:31:55.520]  the best is we've got, I just can't lie to you.
[01:31:55.520 --> 01:31:56.520]  I just can't do it.
[01:31:56.520 --> 01:32:05.160]  Please don't forget, we have a lot of amazing deals on the site.
[01:32:05.160 --> 01:32:08.920]  We still have store-wide free shipping, we had to end all those big discounts on the

[01:32:11.360 --> 01:32:15.520]  going, even though it's about to sell out on DNA Force, our flagship amazing product.

[01:32:49.960 --> 01:32:54.520]  makes it all possible, whatever you do, get DNA Force today, it's discounted, but it's
[01:32:54.520 --> 01:33:01.000]  about to sell out, we'll be right back.
[01:33:01.000 --> 01:33:08.000]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:33:08.000 --> 01:33:22.000]  Alex, we've got a plan, you'll get less heat if you bow down.
[01:33:22.000 --> 01:33:30.600]  Alright, let's rampage through your calls.
[01:33:30.600 --> 01:33:35.600]  Right through to the fourth hour, I just took one caller, and I don't mean to be so mean
[01:33:35.600 --> 01:33:39.200]  to him, but people tell me, people walk to me like in restaurants, or at the grocery
[01:33:39.200 --> 01:33:42.960]  store, or at the shopping mall, or when I get back to where they go, you know if you
[01:33:42.960 --> 01:33:50.320]  were a little less extreme, maybe you wouldn't have got banned, or hey, if you kind of worked
[01:33:50.320 --> 01:33:54.320]  with the system, maybe you get left alone, I'm trying to overturn the corrupt level of
[01:33:54.320 --> 01:34:01.040]  system, I'm not trying to earn scouting merits from the pedophile New World Order, and these
[01:34:01.040 --> 01:34:07.480]  listeners, not many of them, but a certain percentage, they call in, so you can see and
[01:34:07.480 --> 01:34:11.640]  hear what I'm seeing and hearing on the street, like, how you like getting banned, how you
[01:34:11.640 --> 01:34:16.840]  like all the attacks, how you like having your kids taken away, I'm like, my kids weren't
[01:34:16.840 --> 01:34:20.440]  taken away, but that shows how sick you are, that you think that's a good thing for my
[01:34:20.440 --> 01:34:26.760]  political actions, and they're like, well, if you left the system alone, maybe these
[01:34:26.760 --> 01:34:33.280]  are followers, and they can't get out of that idea that if you grovel, you'll be okay, how
[01:34:33.280 --> 01:34:39.360]  are you a revolutionary if you're not willing to put skin in the game, and again, I've given
[01:34:39.360 --> 01:34:47.360]  this analogy probably a thousand times, it's not been on there 25 years, but I'm going
[01:34:47.360 --> 01:34:52.720]  to give it again, they didn't have radar until the end of World War II, and it wasn't deployed
[01:34:52.720 --> 01:34:58.480]  in Europe, and so when the B-17s and the liberators, the Lancasters, and all the bombers were going
[01:34:58.480 --> 01:35:03.120]  into Europe, and sometimes half the mission would be shot down, that means 20 planes
[01:35:03.120 --> 01:35:10.080]  go in, or sometimes 1,000 planes, 500 get blown up, 500 crews die, you take off, and
[01:35:10.080 --> 01:35:14.720]  some of those missions, 50% of you are going to die, usually it's about 10%, until we had
[01:35:14.720 --> 01:35:21.120]  their superiority about late 44, that's a stressful job.
[01:35:21.120 --> 01:35:24.480]  And what were those boys told to do?
[01:35:24.480 --> 01:35:28.840]  You've got a map, you're following the leader, they've got their compasses, they're measuring,
[01:35:28.840 --> 01:35:32.360]  you've got landmarks you're looking for, but it's cloudy, look for flat clouds, and so
[01:35:32.360 --> 01:35:38.600]  you see up ahead, artillery firing shrapnel into the air, and you fly into the shrapnel,
[01:35:38.600 --> 01:35:42.960]  which blows out your engines, it comes through the window, your co-pilots, they're 700 miles
[01:35:42.960 --> 01:35:50.560]  an hour of the shrapnel, they're dead, that's our job is to steer into the flag, and if
[01:35:50.560 --> 01:35:54.880]  they could literally steer into the flag, I could steer into the political flag, my job
[01:35:54.880 --> 01:35:59.680]  is a thousand times easier than my grandfathers, both of them, this is not, it's not like I'm
[01:35:59.680 --> 01:36:04.800]  even doing anything, we have a bunch of America-hating traders that say America sucks and families
[01:36:04.800 --> 01:36:10.600]  suck, they want to kill born babies, and I can't take being sued or lied about, I'm
[01:36:10.600 --> 01:36:15.800]  looking for the fricking flak man, don't call up and tell me how to avoid it, it's the only
[01:36:15.800 --> 01:36:21.400]  damn radar I've got, I'm flying down the nozzle of that fricking gun, because I'm gonna take
[01:36:21.400 --> 01:36:25.920]  out who's on the other end of it, here we go, this is like professional wrestling, professional
[01:36:25.920 --> 01:36:31.160]  wrestling is a facsimile of the tribal leader getting up and saying the enemy's fires are
[01:36:31.160 --> 01:36:35.640]  two miles to the north, they outnumber us two to one, they're coming to kill us and take
[01:36:35.640 --> 01:36:40.760]  our lives tomorrow, we must attack tonight under cover of darkness and kill them with
[01:36:40.760 --> 01:36:47.800]  everything we've got, or we will be destroyed, now get your weapons and prepare to kill,
[01:36:47.800 --> 01:36:51.640]  what do you think, that's not professional wrestling, that's what all our ancestors did,
[01:36:51.640 --> 01:36:58.800]  we survived, they said get ready to kill, now we don't have to physically kill now, but
[01:36:58.800 --> 01:37:06.680]  we have to kill ideas and act to stop being afraid of being demonized, so I'm not imitating
[01:37:06.680 --> 01:37:13.160]  wrestling, wrestling imitates the ancient archetypes of rallying the people to war, and to the
[01:37:13.160 --> 01:37:21.880]  wild delight, instead of giving in to fear, embrace the power that God gave you, and stand
[01:37:21.880 --> 01:37:27.560]  for your family now and defeat the globalist, stop trying to conform to them, bending to
[01:37:27.560 --> 01:37:32.240]  their will has brought us to their point, every time I got tricked by them, oh we're
[01:37:32.240 --> 01:37:39.000]  just sad and sweet, apologize for what you did, okay I apologize, they attacked that,
[01:37:39.000 --> 01:37:44.760]  alright I said I'd go to your calls, so I'll hit the vaccine, this is the biggest ever,
[01:37:44.760 --> 01:37:50.800]  six after next hour I'm behind here, I'm gonna go to your calls right now, but I can feel
[01:37:50.800 --> 01:37:55.240]  the spirit of America and the world awakening, it feels good, can't you feel it, the enemy
[01:37:55.240 --> 01:37:59.640]  can feel their squealing and pain, putting on their confidence acts, but it's never
[01:37:59.640 --> 01:38:11.240]  gonna work, Zach in Indiana, you're on the air, go ahead, a long time listener, first
[01:38:11.240 --> 01:38:16.880]  time caller, love your products, love what you're doing, don't worry, I will never tell
[01:38:16.880 --> 01:38:22.800]  you to quit doing what you're doing, when you're going through hell keep on going, absolutely
[01:38:22.800 --> 01:38:29.400]  brother what's on your mind about the Mueller report, basically we've got no collusion despite
[01:38:29.400 --> 01:38:35.600]  multiple attempts to entice people to collude, no collusion, yet the liberals continue on
[01:38:35.600 --> 01:38:42.520]  double down and keep on going and my question is when do we stand up and say enough, I've
[01:38:42.520 --> 01:38:47.800]  raised six kids, my grandfather told me something when I was young, that what you allow will
[01:38:47.800 --> 01:38:54.400]  continue and every time you get a small it, every time you get a Clinton that gets away
[01:38:54.400 --> 01:39:00.800]  with breaking the law with no repercussions, not only does it embolden the left, it kind
[01:39:00.800 --> 01:39:05.840]  of demoralizes the right and I just, I mean, I'm to the point where I'm just like enough,
[01:39:05.840 --> 01:39:11.960]  but you know, when is enough enough, when do we say no more and people start facing
[01:39:11.960 --> 01:39:14.480]  consequences for their idiot actions?
[01:39:14.480 --> 01:39:20.760]  No, I totally agree with you and the good news is the arrogance of them letting small
[01:39:20.760 --> 01:39:25.200]  it off and all that only will come more people up, but the fact that the Democrats rubbed
[01:39:25.200 --> 01:39:30.160]  their eyeballs with the Russians and the Chinese, they blame us for that, I mean, I agree, Trump
[01:39:30.160 --> 01:39:34.040]  has to move, the Justice Department has to move, grand juries have to move, this is not
[01:39:34.040 --> 01:39:41.520]  a inner party fight or two parties fighting, this is, this is criminal activity, I mean,
[01:39:41.520 --> 01:39:48.240]  this is crazy maniacs with a hard on destroy the country, CHICOM funded and Hollywood totally
[01:39:48.240 --> 01:39:54.520]  delusional and it's just got to be dealt with, what do you think it should be done?
[01:39:54.520 --> 01:39:59.920]  I've supervised crews of men who've been in prison in construction fields, I've run
[01:39:59.920 --> 01:40:05.720]  a garage full of mechanics, same story and like I said, I mean, if you get a problem,
[01:40:05.720 --> 01:40:09.000]  if you got a couple of employees giving you a problem, they're not doing their job, they're
[01:40:09.000 --> 01:40:14.360]  not showing up on time, you make an example of them, you know, you don't, I mean, nothing,
[01:40:14.360 --> 01:40:18.280]  nothing bad, nothing violent, but you show, show the rest of the employees, there will
[01:40:18.280 --> 01:40:22.240]  be repercussions if you do not do what needs to be done.
[01:40:22.240 --> 01:40:23.240]  Exactly.
[01:40:23.240 --> 01:40:27.360]  I mean, we're not saying a lot of top Democrats, airplanes need to go down this week.
[01:40:27.360 --> 01:40:31.480]  All we're saying is they need to be indicted, they need to be audited, they're the ones
[01:40:31.480 --> 01:40:36.840]  on TV saying audit all the conservatives, these Democrats like, like Feinstein, a CHICOM
[01:40:36.840 --> 01:40:40.720]  operative knowingly in her office, these people are a joke, and for them to sit there and
[01:40:40.720 --> 01:40:44.920]  say, we're going to keep going that you're Russians, no, we're going after you, you're
[01:40:44.920 --> 01:40:50.560]  the damn people that say America sucks, how can they be the party that tells us how bad
[01:40:50.560 --> 01:40:55.320]  America is and destroy our borders and end our country and then we're the supposed foreign
[01:40:55.320 --> 01:41:00.440]  agents, it just doesn't fly, the dog doesn't hunt.
[01:41:00.440 --> 01:41:03.120]  No, it does not.
[01:41:03.120 --> 01:41:08.400]  And I mean, it's just, it's maddening, you know, I mean, even here locally, there's
[01:41:08.400 --> 01:41:16.440]  been some liberal politicians, I mean, we had a prosecutor south of here, beat his girlfriend.
[01:41:16.440 --> 01:41:17.720]  Was there any repercussions for it?
[01:41:17.720 --> 01:41:19.400]  No, he's just not prosecutor no more.
[01:41:19.400 --> 01:41:24.760]  He got a slap on the wrist with the community service, or if it was near you, we'd be doing
[01:41:24.760 --> 01:41:26.960]  years in jail.
[01:41:26.960 --> 01:41:33.320]  You know, actually confess to criminal confinement.
[01:41:33.320 --> 01:41:36.640]  And I just think you want to throw your hands up in the air, there's two different kinds
[01:41:36.640 --> 01:41:38.760]  of legal systems in this country.
[01:41:38.760 --> 01:41:44.120]  There's the, you know, the left, it gets away with everything, and me, just a hardworking
[01:41:44.120 --> 01:41:49.240]  guy trying to take care of his family, if I, you know, if I have one to me drink to decide
[01:41:49.240 --> 01:41:52.240]  to go do something stupid, which I don't, and go drive a car.
[01:41:52.240 --> 01:41:53.240]  No, that's right.
[01:41:53.240 --> 01:41:56.240]  Good people have the book thrown at him and folks see through that, Zach, God bless you.
[01:41:56.240 --> 01:41:59.600]  I'm thinking like one call per segment now, because these calls are so good when we come
[01:41:59.600 --> 01:42:05.560]  back, I'm up at three and we're going to go to a bear in Wisconsin or Washington.
[01:42:05.560 --> 01:42:06.840]  I keep saying that wrong.
[01:42:06.840 --> 01:42:08.880]  My eyes aren't as good as they were even three or four years ago.
[01:42:08.880 --> 01:42:11.920]  We got to move that, that computer screen closer than 20 feet.
[01:42:11.920 --> 01:42:13.040]  I can't read that anymore.
[01:42:13.040 --> 01:42:16.840]  And my eyes are starting to go folks, I'm getting older, 45.
[01:42:16.840 --> 01:42:20.960]  And then we got David and Mark and Brian and Jonathan and Gary and Jacob and everybody
[01:42:20.960 --> 01:42:21.960]  else.
[01:42:21.960 --> 01:42:25.280]  Please don't forget, I hate plugging, but the products are great.
[01:42:25.280 --> 01:42:30.360]  But I barely plug because I don't want to plug when I cover news info or store.com.

[01:42:36.040 --> 01:42:37.040]  spread the word.

[01:43:21.040 --> 01:43:25.040]  that sure get you a quick boost, but burn out in just a few hours and have terrible

[01:45:27.920 --> 01:45:32.200]  I can't be destroyed now, as long as I realize I've done right and the longer the people
[01:45:32.200 --> 01:45:37.000]  know the truth and you can't be destroyed either, as long as you bind yourself to something
[01:45:37.000 --> 01:45:42.040]  and commit to it and go through the fire for it, there is a magic that then takes place,
[01:45:42.040 --> 01:45:43.720]  the transcend space and time.
[01:45:43.720 --> 01:45:48.240]  When you commit, be a word of mouth or to pray for us or to spread our articles and videos.
[01:45:48.240 --> 01:45:53.560]  That overrides everything the enemy's doing, so please now commit to support Infowars,

[01:46:04.080 --> 01:46:06.320]  you are changing the world?
[01:46:06.320 --> 01:46:10.040]  It's you that has defeated Hillary and the Globlest.
[01:46:10.040 --> 01:46:14.840]  It is you, the Infowars, across the planet that stood against the bully, that stood against
[01:46:14.840 --> 01:46:18.480]  the peer pressure, that stood against the threats that have now changed the world.
[01:46:18.480 --> 01:46:23.360]  And that's why you've been on the team supporting us, praying for us and spreading the word.
[01:46:23.360 --> 01:46:24.360]  You are the Infowars.
[01:46:24.360 --> 01:46:29.440]  And now because of their intensifying censorship, it's more important than ever that everyone
[01:46:29.440 --> 01:46:34.520]  go to Infowars.com forward slash newsletter and sign up via email so there's no way the
[01:46:34.520 --> 01:46:40.400]  censors can get between us with critical videos, articles, breaking news, intel, you name it.
[01:46:40.400 --> 01:46:45.960]  And so now I ask you more than ever to share the Infowars.com articles, to share the videos,
[01:46:45.960 --> 01:46:49.200]  to tell people by the local stations you're listening to, but the bare minimum you can

[01:47:39.440 --> 01:47:47.960]  on the storm, to this world we're born, riders on the storm, to this world we're thrown,
[01:47:47.960 --> 01:47:56.640]  into this house we're born, into this world we're thrown, into this house, your family
[01:47:56.640 --> 01:48:05.840]  names your house, then into this world, first you enter the house, then you enter the world.
[01:48:05.840 --> 01:48:14.680]  I'm with House Jones, proud of the old name, means steadfastness.
[01:48:14.680 --> 01:48:24.120]  Take a long holiday, let your children play, let your children play, if you give this man
[01:48:24.120 --> 01:48:35.000]  a ride, if you give this man a ride, sweet memory will die, killer on the road, yeah.
[01:48:35.000 --> 01:48:36.000]  Good stuff.
[01:48:36.000 --> 01:48:37.240]  All right, I'm going to stop screwing around.
[01:48:37.240 --> 01:48:38.240]  Each caller gets a minute and a half.
[01:48:38.240 --> 01:48:39.240]  I'm going to barely comment.
[01:48:39.240 --> 01:48:40.240]  We have the next person.
[01:48:40.240 --> 01:48:41.240]  We've got 20-something callers.
[01:48:41.240 --> 01:48:44.080]  Who is up next here?
[01:48:44.080 --> 01:48:45.800]  Let's talk to Mark in Colorado.
[01:48:45.800 --> 01:48:47.800]  Mark, thanks for holding her on the ear.
[01:48:47.800 --> 01:48:48.800]  Go ahead.
[01:48:48.800 --> 01:48:49.800]  Yeah.
[01:48:49.800 --> 01:48:50.800]  Welcome.
[01:48:50.800 --> 01:48:51.800]  Seems like y'all, thank you.
[01:48:51.800 --> 01:48:53.600]  Seems like you have all the friends out to get you.
[01:48:53.600 --> 01:48:58.200]  Maybe you're in their cross pairs, anyhow, really quick.
[01:48:58.200 --> 01:48:59.960]  I just want to touch on that molar report.
[01:48:59.960 --> 01:49:04.440]  I don't see if there's a coincidence that Julian Assange was arrested right after the
[01:49:04.440 --> 01:49:05.920]  report dropped.
[01:49:05.920 --> 01:49:10.440]  I think they're going to tie it all together to get cases going against all the people
[01:49:10.440 --> 01:49:12.440]  that should be indicted.
[01:49:12.440 --> 01:49:15.600]  I don't think that they should pardon Julian Assange yet.
[01:49:15.600 --> 01:49:18.680]  We need to get him to spill the beans and give him immunity, and they can live free
[01:49:18.680 --> 01:49:19.680]  here.
[01:49:19.680 --> 01:49:26.080]  Then I just want to touch a point really quick on Robert Stab, your country in the back molar.
[01:49:26.080 --> 01:49:29.040]  Remember the Bundy incident and all that was happening out there?
[01:49:29.040 --> 01:49:32.560]  Well, that happened to be part of some mines west of there that were part of that uranium
[01:49:32.560 --> 01:49:33.560]  one deal.
[01:49:33.560 --> 01:49:37.600]  I think a lot of this is all tying together here, and it's going to come together one
[01:49:37.600 --> 01:49:38.600]  big point.
[01:49:38.600 --> 01:49:43.600]  I want to even put that out there, it's like even Seth Rich and his murder, and I think
[01:49:43.600 --> 01:49:47.480]  a lot of people have forgotten about even his private investigator that was shot in
[01:49:47.480 --> 01:49:51.600]  the back twice in a parking garage and then ran over, and yes, he'll be still survived.
[01:49:51.600 --> 01:49:54.880]  I haven't heard much about him lately anymore, but...
[01:49:54.880 --> 01:50:01.080]  Well, they sue anybody that even questions Seth Rich's death, even though you have free
[01:50:01.080 --> 01:50:02.080]  speech to do that.
[01:50:02.080 --> 01:50:03.080]  So what does that tell you?
[01:50:03.080 --> 01:50:07.960]  But you're absolutely right about the big picture, and where all this is going.
[01:50:07.960 --> 01:50:12.200]  It just gets crazier and crazier and crazier.
[01:50:12.200 --> 01:50:17.120]  And when you talk about molar and the so-called 12 people that haven't been indicted that
[01:50:17.120 --> 01:50:22.440]  are been referred for indictments inside this, they plan to have this continue one.
[01:50:22.440 --> 01:50:25.480]  That's why Trump has to understand he's got to go after these people.
[01:50:25.480 --> 01:50:28.200]  They've not made a deal with him to back off and leave the country alone.
[01:50:28.200 --> 01:50:29.360]  These are chai-com ages.
[01:50:29.360 --> 01:50:33.400]  These are globalists, and he's got to go after them and get on the offense.
[01:50:33.400 --> 01:50:36.560]  The Democrats have signaled they're going to continue this fraud.
[01:50:36.560 --> 01:50:42.080]  While they're all as dirty as a latrine, they're as dirty as a porta-potty.
[01:50:42.080 --> 01:50:43.760]  So give them what they want.
[01:50:43.760 --> 01:50:44.760]  Stop rolling over.
[01:50:44.760 --> 01:50:49.120]  They've been squatting on top of America with the mainstream media and Hollywood, pissing
[01:50:49.120 --> 01:50:50.760]  in everybody's faces forever.
[01:50:50.760 --> 01:50:54.160]  It's time to stop giving in to fear to the globalists.
[01:50:54.160 --> 01:50:56.920]  It's time to give them what they want, which is prison.
[01:50:56.920 --> 01:50:58.680]  Don't back down.
[01:50:58.680 --> 01:51:01.600]  I'm certainly not backing down, and I hope Trump doesn't either, because you know, Ralph
[01:51:01.600 --> 01:51:04.680]  Walter Emerson, he has a really good poem out there called The Concord Highman at the
[01:51:04.680 --> 01:51:08.560]  very bottom of it, it states, for those out there who dare to die, so our children can
[01:51:08.560 --> 01:51:09.560]  live free.
[01:51:09.560 --> 01:51:10.560]  I stand by that one.
[01:51:10.560 --> 01:51:11.560]  I hear you.
[01:51:11.560 --> 01:51:13.200]  I appreciate your call, brother.
[01:51:13.200 --> 01:51:14.200]  Appreciate your call.
[01:51:14.200 --> 01:51:16.360]  Let's go to Bear in Washington.
[01:51:16.360 --> 01:51:17.960]  Bear, you're on the air.
[01:51:17.960 --> 01:51:19.520]  What's your view on all this?
[01:51:19.520 --> 01:51:20.520]  Hey, Alex.
[01:51:20.520 --> 01:51:22.320]  Thanks for having me on.
[01:51:22.320 --> 01:51:26.080]  I'm a little nervous.
[01:51:26.080 --> 01:51:30.480]  The Patriots out here are having their equipment attacked.
[01:51:30.480 --> 01:51:36.920]  That is how they're controlling this, apparently Obama signed in via the deep state cyber command.
[01:51:36.920 --> 01:51:38.440]  They're attacking BIOS.
[01:51:38.440 --> 01:51:42.320]  I have no of, just a set of 25 Patriots.
[01:51:42.320 --> 01:51:45.640]  Out of the 25, 10 of them have lost equipment.
[01:51:45.640 --> 01:51:52.840]  I've lost channels, I've lost computers, I've had my BIOS destroyed, many others have had
[01:51:52.840 --> 01:51:53.840]  their phones fried.
[01:51:53.840 --> 01:51:55.440]  You know, it's funny you say that.
[01:51:55.440 --> 01:52:01.640]  Remember about 12 years ago, John McCain said, if someone pirates music, guys, search this
[01:52:01.640 --> 01:52:02.640]  on Google web.
[01:52:02.640 --> 01:52:03.640]  Don't click news.
[01:52:03.640 --> 01:52:05.880]  That's only good for a month.
[01:52:05.880 --> 01:52:07.800]  You know that for the listeners.
[01:52:07.800 --> 01:52:13.080]  Search web, or search Bing, it's not as bad as Google, type in John McCain says, blow
[01:52:13.080 --> 01:52:15.360]  up computers of pirates.
[01:52:15.360 --> 01:52:20.320]  Well, he just says, if we think you download the music illegally, they have viruses they
[01:52:20.320 --> 01:52:23.080]  can send to destroy your computer.
[01:52:23.080 --> 01:52:25.680]  So that is definitely something that goes on.
[01:52:25.680 --> 01:52:30.400]  There's also just planned obsolescence and a lot of computers are crap.
[01:52:30.400 --> 01:52:31.400]  So that goes on.
[01:52:31.400 --> 01:52:36.400]  But yeah, in this age of censorship, you know, we had them six months ago have a big computer
[01:52:36.400 --> 01:52:41.480]  company break into our servers for one minute and then report on the national news that
[01:52:41.480 --> 01:52:44.000]  we've been compromised, which we hadn't been.
[01:52:44.000 --> 01:52:45.920]  So I'm definitely aware of that type of stuff, Bear.
[01:52:45.920 --> 01:52:47.440]  I appreciate your call.
[01:52:47.440 --> 01:52:48.840]  And then Obama stay behind network.
[01:52:48.840 --> 01:52:49.840]  That's exactly what they're doing.
[01:52:49.840 --> 01:52:57.240]  They're in cyber command or in all of it from me to take action, Jimmy, and the great state
[01:52:57.240 --> 01:52:58.240]  of Maine.
[01:52:58.240 --> 01:52:59.240]  Jimmy, you're on the air.
[01:52:59.240 --> 01:53:00.240]  Welcome.
[01:53:00.240 --> 01:53:01.240]  Going on Alex, man.
[01:53:01.240 --> 01:53:02.640]  You doing a good job.
[01:53:02.640 --> 01:53:03.640]  I'm trying.
[01:53:03.640 --> 01:53:05.720]  Um, the genies are ready out the bottle.
[01:53:05.720 --> 01:53:09.040]  I think we've done waiting for Trump to fucking go after them.
[01:53:09.040 --> 01:53:10.040]  The time is now.
[01:53:10.040 --> 01:53:14.240]  Um, he's treating us and American people like him and appreciate what we do every day for
[01:53:14.240 --> 01:53:15.240]  them.
[01:53:15.240 --> 01:53:16.240]  We put it all on the line.
[01:53:16.240 --> 01:53:17.240]  You put it all on the line.
[01:53:17.240 --> 01:53:19.040]  You need to do this expeditiously.
[01:53:19.040 --> 01:53:20.640]  You've been waiting long enough.
[01:53:20.640 --> 01:53:24.040]  We need to go after them, get these traders off the street and drain them and drain them.
[01:53:24.040 --> 01:53:28.160]  No, I totally agree because Trump has to know the internet's being handed over to the UN.
[01:53:28.160 --> 01:53:31.720]  They're all signing agreements to censor, uh, they're screwing everybody over.
[01:53:31.720 --> 01:53:32.720]  I agree.
[01:53:32.720 --> 01:53:36.280]  He must go on the offense because it's the right thing to do plus we're under attack.
[01:53:36.280 --> 01:53:38.600]  What do you think Trump should do?
[01:53:38.600 --> 01:53:39.600]  He hung up.
[01:53:39.600 --> 01:53:41.280]  That color was on fire.
[01:53:41.280 --> 01:53:43.960]  I was ready to talk to him.
[01:53:43.960 --> 01:53:45.440]  That's too bad.
[01:53:45.440 --> 01:53:51.920]  Brian and Pennsylvania, you're on the air, go ahead.
[01:53:51.920 --> 01:53:54.120]  Right now, which is to say happy Easter.
[01:53:54.120 --> 01:53:58.760]  Um, I hope you have a wonderful rest of holy week with your family.
[01:53:58.760 --> 01:53:59.760]  Thank you, sir.
[01:53:59.760 --> 01:54:04.120]  I, I'd also like to say, uh, you know, I own the Alexa pure pro because especially during
[01:54:04.120 --> 01:54:09.240]  this holy week of Easter, I love my neighbor, but I refuse to drink their heart medication.
[01:54:09.240 --> 01:54:11.760]  Um, two quick things before I dig it.
[01:54:11.760 --> 01:54:16.080]  But explain that well water, some of the most polluted stuff in the country because you
[01:54:16.080 --> 01:54:17.080]  got glyphosate.
[01:54:17.080 --> 01:54:24.000]  You got all your neighbor's medications that they're putting into a, uh, septic tank.
[01:54:24.000 --> 01:54:26.360]  That then goes into the groundwater and you drink it.
[01:54:26.360 --> 01:54:28.720]  So absolutely the number one thing anybody can do.
[01:54:28.720 --> 01:54:30.840]  And by the way, I forget to do this again, man.
[01:54:30.840 --> 01:54:34.960]  When I drink filtered water, when I take the supplements, my life's so much better.
[01:54:34.960 --> 01:54:38.160]  When I forget because I'm not Mr. Frickin health.
[01:54:38.160 --> 01:54:39.160]  I feel it.
[01:54:39.160 --> 01:54:43.040]  So, so yes, tell me about not wanting to drink your neighbor's heart medication.
[01:54:43.040 --> 01:54:48.440]  Well, where I live, and I think this is the same story for most of the country.
[01:54:48.440 --> 01:54:54.280]  Our water filtration is based on a reverse osmosis system that was constructed around
[01:54:54.280 --> 01:54:55.640]  the turn of the century.
[01:54:55.640 --> 01:55:01.320]  And I have zero, zero faith in local reporting on the quality of the water.
[01:55:01.320 --> 01:55:04.760]  And so I do all that I can do and I purchased my own filter.
[01:55:04.760 --> 01:55:08.020]  Well, look at Flint, Michigan.
[01:55:08.020 --> 01:55:12.080]  Where water is full of lead, mercury, poisons, E. Coli.
[01:55:12.080 --> 01:55:15.880]  The answer is everyone, if you're drinking water, you should filter it.
[01:55:15.880 --> 01:55:20.440]  And then I'll never get David Hogg goes, you know, Alex Jones on C-span, he goes, little
[01:55:20.440 --> 01:55:21.440]  anti-gun guy.
[01:55:21.440 --> 01:55:27.600]  He goes, he says the water has toxins and then he sells a water filter.
[01:55:27.600 --> 01:55:28.600]  Yeah.
[01:55:28.600 --> 01:55:35.200]  It's like saying your kids need vitamin C and then I sell vitamin C or Jones says we
[01:55:35.200 --> 01:55:36.480]  need to wear shoes.
[01:55:36.480 --> 01:55:37.480]  We walk in the snow.
[01:55:37.480 --> 01:55:39.200]  Then he advertises shoes.
[01:55:39.200 --> 01:55:40.560]  Yes, exactly.
[01:55:40.560 --> 01:55:46.080]  But see in his little brain, where everything is a scam, he thinks I'm scamming people when
[01:55:46.080 --> 01:55:47.880]  it's a direct sale.
[01:55:47.880 --> 01:55:51.600]  We have the best gravity fed systems, electric peer and pro peer, or apples and oranges,
[01:55:51.600 --> 01:55:53.320]  but they're both excellent.
[01:55:53.320 --> 01:55:54.600]  Everyone needs it.
[01:55:54.600 --> 01:55:56.040]  Everyone should filter their water.
[01:55:56.040 --> 01:55:57.320]  This is the smartest thing you can do.
[01:55:57.320 --> 01:56:00.400]  It doesn't mean occasionally you don't drink some ice tea at a restaurant, but you need
[01:56:00.400 --> 01:56:01.920]  to filter your water.
[01:56:01.920 --> 01:56:03.560]  Your skin is your biggest organ.
[01:56:03.560 --> 01:56:05.600]  You absorb it there.
[01:56:05.600 --> 01:56:09.000]  You need filters on your shower or your bath.
[01:56:09.000 --> 01:56:10.000]  Exactly.
[01:56:10.000 --> 01:56:11.960]  And then you look at what's in the water table.
[01:56:11.960 --> 01:56:12.960]  It's insane.
[01:56:12.960 --> 01:56:14.960]  Anything else, Brian?
[01:56:14.960 --> 01:56:15.960]  Yeah.
[01:56:15.960 --> 01:56:21.920]  So real quickly, I just wanted to talk about one quick thing.
[01:56:21.920 --> 01:56:26.960]  I'm calling out here from, from Luzerne County in Pennsylvania and arguably it is one of
[01:56:26.960 --> 01:56:32.280]  the most, I'd say top three, depending on who you talk to, corrupt counties.
[01:56:32.280 --> 01:56:38.080]  They are currently trying to enforce and successfully doing so, enforcing a rain tax.
[01:56:38.080 --> 01:56:43.000]  It is, I think, on its way to get to President Trump, but it needs to get national attention
[01:56:43.000 --> 01:56:46.000]  because this is the test bed for some ridiculous stuff here.
[01:56:46.000 --> 01:56:50.760]  But in terms of the Mueller report, I think they go in detail.
[01:56:50.760 --> 01:56:57.880]  I think about 30 pages trying to define the word otherwise in terms of one aspect of the
[01:56:57.880 --> 01:57:04.040]  Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and they're going to be, I mean, just like you said, you, you take
[01:57:04.040 --> 01:57:09.680]  flak when you're over the target, they're zeroed in on a single word and trying to define
[01:57:09.680 --> 01:57:13.160]  how they can pull obstruction out of that.
[01:57:13.160 --> 01:57:17.480]  And I think they're going for obstruction of a crime that didn't exist.
[01:57:17.480 --> 01:57:21.000]  They're going to crank it up to 11 for the foreseeable future.
[01:57:21.000 --> 01:57:23.240]  Don't hang up, Brian.
[01:57:23.240 --> 01:57:24.240]  You're a smart caller.
[01:57:24.240 --> 01:57:26.680]  I want to come back and give you the floor for five minutes.
[01:57:26.680 --> 01:57:31.160]  And then we're going to go to Gary, we're going to go to Jimmy, we're going to go to
[01:57:31.160 --> 01:57:32.840]  Jacob, we're going to go to everybody.
[01:57:32.840 --> 01:57:34.200]  Boom, boom, boom.
[01:57:34.200 --> 01:57:35.720]  Hour number three.
[01:57:35.720 --> 01:57:39.520]  And yes, I will get into the vaccine news that's so paramount, I promise.
[01:57:39.520 --> 01:57:40.520]  And so much more.
[01:57:40.520 --> 01:57:47.400]  By the way, the modern architect of Notre Dame says it looks like ours.
[01:57:47.400 --> 01:57:49.400]  Frank in North Carolina, thanks for holding so long.
[01:57:49.400 --> 01:57:50.400]  Go ahead.
[01:57:50.400 --> 01:57:52.320]  Yeah, I just have to say something, man.
[01:57:52.320 --> 01:57:56.080]  It seems like every time I turn on your broadcast, you're bragging.
[01:57:56.080 --> 01:57:57.080]  It just gets old, man.
[01:57:57.080 --> 01:58:00.040]  I'm going to shut you down right now, okay?
[01:58:00.040 --> 01:58:02.280]  We're taking calls about your nomination.
[01:58:02.280 --> 01:58:06.360]  Do you understand they're having congressional hearings trying to shut us down?
[01:58:06.360 --> 01:58:08.920]  Do you understand I'm ringing the alarm?
[01:58:08.920 --> 01:58:12.000]  If that was happening to anybody else, I'd be freaked out.
[01:58:12.000 --> 01:58:14.720]  I mean, what's it going to take us being shut down?
[01:58:14.720 --> 01:58:15.720]  Is that what you want, Frank?
[01:58:15.720 --> 01:58:16.720]  You know what, Alex?
[01:58:16.720 --> 01:58:17.720]  Put him on pause again.
[01:58:17.720 --> 01:58:23.280]  Hey, Frank, do you understand it's not bragging to say we are the tip of the spear, we're
[01:58:23.280 --> 01:58:25.160]  under attack, we need your help.
[01:58:25.160 --> 01:58:29.520]  As much begging as I do, we can barely pay the bills and grow in the face of this.
[01:58:29.520 --> 01:58:32.520]  I'm not going to just stop growth and let them start pushing us backwards.
[01:58:32.520 --> 01:58:33.520]  Do you understand?
[01:58:33.520 --> 01:58:34.760]  I need your help, Frank.
[01:58:34.760 --> 01:58:37.040]  I need your help, Frank.
[01:58:37.040 --> 01:58:42.320]  Go to infowarstore.com right now and help fund the Info War.
[01:58:42.320 --> 01:58:43.320]  Do you understand?
[01:58:43.320 --> 01:58:45.040]  I need your help, Frank.
[01:58:45.040 --> 01:58:48.600]  Free press needs your help, Frank.
[01:58:48.600 --> 01:58:53.520]  There are thousands of ideologies out there, hundreds of different political systems, and
[01:58:53.520 --> 01:58:56.520]  most of them are funded by the globalist.
[01:58:56.520 --> 01:58:59.120]  Info Wars is truly the tip of the spear of the zeitgeist.
[01:58:59.120 --> 01:59:02.600]  That's why the globalists are obsessed with it, trying to shut it down.
[01:59:02.600 --> 01:59:04.240]  I didn't invent all this.
[01:59:04.240 --> 01:59:09.120]  I went and researched the Renaissance, Americana, and what really works for humanity, and I'm
[01:59:09.120 --> 01:59:10.520]  simply trying to bring it back.
[01:59:10.520 --> 01:59:14.880]  And lo and behold, it's super popular like it's always been.
[01:59:14.880 --> 01:59:18.880]  That's why the globalists are trying to shut it down so desperately, because we have the
[01:59:18.880 --> 01:59:22.760]  light in the dark of the night that sends chills up my spine.
[01:59:22.760 --> 01:59:27.280]  So whatever you do, continue to support yourself and Info Wars by buying the great products
[01:59:27.280 --> 01:59:31.720]  at infowarstore.com, by spreading the articles, by spreading the videos, and by praying for
[01:59:31.720 --> 01:59:36.320]  this operation and for praying for this nation and the world for peace and discernment.
[01:59:36.320 --> 01:59:40.240]  For myself and the whole Info Wars family, I want to thank all of you for what you've
[01:59:40.240 --> 01:59:44.200]  done, because without you, Info Wars is nothing.
[01:59:44.200 --> 01:59:51.560]  You are the Info War, and I salute you.
[01:59:51.560 --> 01:59:58.560]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[02:00:21.560 --> 02:00:45.920]  This is Ace, a win for this president, who for now two years has essentially been swimming.
[02:00:45.920 --> 02:00:47.320]  There was no Russia collusion.
[02:00:47.320 --> 02:00:51.280]  He is backed up by Mueller.
[02:00:51.280 --> 02:00:56.400]  Maybe every time he said no collusion, but more than 231 times so far, maybe every time
[02:00:56.400 --> 02:00:58.680]  he said no collusion, he was telling the truth.
[02:00:58.680 --> 02:01:04.120]  This was an illegal takedown that failed.
[02:01:04.120 --> 02:01:09.400]  And hopefully somebody's going to look at the other side.
[02:01:09.400 --> 02:01:18.840]  Hey, you know, Alex, they might go easy on you if you're backed out, and they're going
[02:01:18.840 --> 02:01:21.920]  to hurt you if you don't.
[02:01:21.920 --> 02:01:27.240]  That's the funniest thing, man, that happens on the street all the time.
[02:01:27.240 --> 02:01:30.720]  It's always some guy that's got a Porsche, some trophy wife, or something.
[02:01:30.720 --> 02:01:32.680]  They think they're powerful as they sold out.
[02:01:32.680 --> 02:01:38.400]  They walk over in the country, people like me built, and they tell me, how's it going?
[02:01:38.400 --> 02:01:40.240]  Boy, you're getting really beat up right now.
[02:01:40.240 --> 02:01:45.400]  You know, you might want to play ball.
[02:01:45.400 --> 02:01:47.520]  It's hilarious.
[02:01:47.520 --> 02:01:50.640]  I'm not here to play ball, dumbass.
[02:01:50.640 --> 02:01:54.560]  I'm here to overturn your system and restore the republic.
[02:01:54.560 --> 02:01:55.560]  So get ready for it.
[02:01:55.560 --> 02:01:56.560]  That's why they don't get it.
[02:01:56.560 --> 02:01:57.560]  I get killed.
[02:01:57.560 --> 02:01:58.560]  I get in prison.
[02:01:58.560 --> 02:02:03.800]  I win as long as I'm right with God, and I'll do whatever it takes.
[02:02:03.800 --> 02:02:05.320]  But I do want to fight as hard as I can.
[02:02:05.320 --> 02:02:06.320]  As long as I can.
[02:02:06.320 --> 02:02:07.320]  That's why I need your prayers, folks.
[02:02:07.320 --> 02:02:10.800]  A lot of great callers here right now.
[02:02:10.800 --> 02:02:12.800]  You can feel the spirit of Liberty rising right now.
[02:02:12.800 --> 02:02:13.800]  I can feel it.
[02:02:13.800 --> 02:02:14.800]  Can't you?
[02:02:14.800 --> 02:02:18.640]  That's what really matters.
[02:02:18.640 --> 02:02:20.440]  Brian and Pizzle Van, you're making some great points.
[02:02:20.440 --> 02:02:21.640]  You got three minutes.
[02:02:21.640 --> 02:02:23.240]  Make those points, my friend.
[02:02:23.240 --> 02:02:24.240]  Yes, sir.
[02:02:24.240 --> 02:02:28.160]  Well, I'd like to just throw a theory out there.
[02:02:28.160 --> 02:02:34.680]  So personally, I come from a long bloodline of Ulster Scots, basically from Northern
[02:02:34.680 --> 02:02:40.520]  Scotland, you know, the Highland Isle of Skye, and Ulster Northern Ireland, and my family's
[02:02:40.520 --> 02:02:41.520]  been here.
[02:02:41.520 --> 02:02:44.960]  So that translates to absolute badasses.
[02:02:44.960 --> 02:02:52.760]  Yeah, and it sometimes works against me, as I'm sure you know, it's the 1600s, you know,
[02:02:52.760 --> 02:02:57.880]  one of which was, I think, a judge during the Salem Witch Trials.
[02:02:57.880 --> 02:03:02.320]  And people like us, there's not many left.
[02:03:02.320 --> 02:03:08.240]  The ones that are left are basically, you know, that strength, that ancestral call is
[02:03:08.240 --> 02:03:09.960]  kind of diluted.
[02:03:09.960 --> 02:03:17.240]  And what I've noticed is, the wool being pulled over our eyes is not successful on families
[02:03:17.240 --> 02:03:19.160]  and bloodlines like this.
[02:03:19.160 --> 02:03:26.120]  So it, you know, what the mainstream media is pushing is very effective for a lot of
[02:03:26.120 --> 02:03:27.120]  people.
[02:03:27.120 --> 02:03:28.120]  Unfortunately, the majority...
[02:03:28.120 --> 02:03:31.880]  Well, let's just say it, we're not wolves, we're sheepdogs, and we look at the general
[02:03:31.880 --> 02:03:36.840]  public, a bunch of sheep, bought into their own destruction, it's very frustrating.
[02:03:36.840 --> 02:03:37.840]  Exactly.
[02:03:37.840 --> 02:03:39.520]  That's a great way to put it.
[02:03:39.520 --> 02:03:44.240]  I mean, I walk through day to day with that ancestral knowledge that, I mean, not that
[02:03:44.240 --> 02:03:46.720]  I can, I can tell right from wrong, a hundred percent.
[02:03:46.720 --> 02:03:49.880]  No, I know, but you're dialed in, you can feel it, yeah.
[02:03:49.880 --> 02:03:50.880]  You could feel it.
[02:03:50.880 --> 02:03:52.960]  It's not just you, it's a bunch of people, you know.
[02:03:52.960 --> 02:03:57.400]  Yeah, talking with my grandfather, who, you know, he's seen a lot of things, you know,
[02:03:57.400 --> 02:04:01.840]  53 year, you know, Mason and so on and so forth.
[02:04:01.840 --> 02:04:05.840]  You know, he could tell and it's just, it's one of those things that you either have it
[02:04:05.840 --> 02:04:06.840]  or you don't.
[02:04:06.840 --> 02:04:09.840]  You know, unfortunately, you can't do that.
[02:04:09.840 --> 02:04:10.840]  No, that's it.
[02:04:10.840 --> 02:04:11.840]  That's what, yeah.
[02:04:11.840 --> 02:04:12.840]  Exactly.
[02:04:12.840 --> 02:04:13.840]  That's what Trump even said to me before.
[02:04:13.840 --> 02:04:15.240]  He goes, either have it or you don't.
[02:04:15.240 --> 02:04:19.000]  You know, people, a little bit of what's happening with Trump conversation, but Trump's like,
[02:04:19.000 --> 02:04:22.800]  you've got it, I've got it, men like us, we either have it or you don't, and that's exactly
[02:04:22.800 --> 02:04:23.800]  what it is.
[02:04:23.800 --> 02:04:24.800]  That's exactly what it is.
[02:04:24.800 --> 02:04:29.080]  And it can be black, it can be white, it can be Asian, it can be Hispanic, you either
[02:04:29.080 --> 02:04:30.080]  have it or you don't.
[02:04:30.080 --> 02:04:31.080]  That's what it is.
[02:04:31.080 --> 02:04:34.080]  Keep fighting a good fight.
[02:04:34.080 --> 02:04:36.080]  Anything else you want to add, Ryan?
[02:04:36.080 --> 02:04:37.080]  Down?
[02:04:37.080 --> 02:04:38.080]  That's all.
[02:04:38.080 --> 02:04:39.080]  God bless you, brother.
[02:04:39.080 --> 02:04:42.960]  Either have it or you don't, and these globalists don't have it.
[02:04:42.960 --> 02:04:43.960]  All they've got is the devil.
[02:04:43.960 --> 02:04:46.960]  Imagine, they don't have any connection to their ancestors.
[02:04:46.960 --> 02:04:47.960]  None of the data.
[02:04:47.960 --> 02:04:48.960]  No connection to God.
[02:04:48.960 --> 02:04:52.960]  They think we're crazy because we know God.
[02:04:52.960 --> 02:04:59.640]  Well, I've got some really good news for all the viewers and all the listeners.
[02:04:59.640 --> 02:05:02.520]  This was going to be a big loss because we couldn't get the Deep Earth Crystals anymore
[02:05:02.520 --> 02:05:07.040]  in a year and a half fight, but we have the original producer, the original crystal source,
[02:05:07.040 --> 02:05:10.440]  the best atomic iodide in the world, X2 is back.
[02:05:10.440 --> 02:05:11.440]  We got it.
[02:05:11.440 --> 02:05:12.920]  This deal just happened about a month ago.
[02:05:12.920 --> 02:05:14.640]  We rushed it into production.
[02:05:14.640 --> 02:05:15.640]  It's been bottled.
[02:05:15.640 --> 02:05:19.880]  The labels are being put on today, and then it's going to be on an 18-wheeler right here
[02:05:19.880 --> 02:05:24.480]  to Austin from the plant in the Rockies, and it's going to be shipped out to you.
[02:05:24.480 --> 02:05:30.400]  Be sure and sign up for auto-ship, get an additional 10% off, the 25% off, celebration of the fact
[02:05:30.400 --> 02:05:34.680]  that we got it back and we're relaunching it, research the iodide conspiracy, find out
[02:05:34.680 --> 02:05:39.080]  why it's so important, find out what the globalists don't want you to have, the good halogens,
[02:05:39.080 --> 02:05:42.880]  what you have, the bad halogens, at infowarstore.com.
[02:05:42.880 --> 02:05:44.880]  That's the umbrella site, infowarstlife.com.
[02:05:44.880 --> 02:05:50.000]  They should write the supplements, and this is the King Daddy, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:05:50.000 --> 02:06:12.000]  This is the King Daddy, ladies and gentlemen, and this is the King Daddy, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:06:12.000 --> 02:06:23.440]  It's Alex Jones, everybody else, and then I promise I'm behind on this on purpose.
[02:06:23.440 --> 02:06:29.520]  This public service announcement on vaccines is so critical and so key, and if people just
[02:06:29.520 --> 02:06:35.160]  get this one piece of info, I know we can save millions of children, and we talk about
[02:06:35.160 --> 02:06:39.600]  children, we don't talk about what color they are, or their mommy or daddy are, but that
[02:06:39.600 --> 02:06:46.120]  soul they've got in their red blood, and how they're always being hunted by the enemy.
[02:06:46.120 --> 02:06:51.280]  That's why I can't ever be a racist, even though minority's been brainwashed against
[02:06:51.280 --> 02:06:57.040]  me, many of them, I can't look at children and hate them for who they are when they have
[02:06:57.040 --> 02:07:05.120]  the potential to universe them, but that doesn't mean I won't stand up for who I am, and that's
[02:07:05.120 --> 02:07:10.240]  why I really love Martin Luther King, because I actually read a lot of his full speeches
[02:07:10.240 --> 02:07:14.040]  and watched a lot of them, and it's just common sense, that's why he was so popular,
[02:07:14.040 --> 02:07:17.920]  he was saying things that everybody knew, and that America wanted, no matter what color
[02:07:17.920 --> 02:07:22.480]  you are, and now you're tuning into the modern left, it's the complete opposite of Martin
[02:07:22.480 --> 02:07:23.480]  Luther King.
[02:07:23.480 --> 02:07:26.360]  He said it's not what color you are, it's what you stand for and what you produce and
[02:07:26.360 --> 02:07:27.360]  what you do.
[02:07:27.360 --> 02:07:32.800]  Everybody knows that, like be honest with you, well there's a badass restaurant, I use
[02:07:32.800 --> 02:07:37.560]  this analogy five hundred times, I'll do it five hundred one times, if there's a super
[02:07:37.560 --> 02:07:42.840]  good restaurant, whether it's soul food or whether it's Chinese or whether it's Southern
[02:07:42.840 --> 02:07:46.840]  cooking or whether it's Mexican, you don't walk in there and look, oh there's a bunch
[02:07:46.840 --> 02:07:52.040]  of Mexicans owning this, I'm not going to eat here, I don't like Mexicans, you go to
[02:07:52.040 --> 02:07:58.040]  Mexican food restaurants, it's almost all white people, because the Mexican food's delicious,
[02:07:58.040 --> 02:08:04.040]  but that's what I mean, you don't listen to a song like Narls Barkley, in fact I want
[02:08:04.040 --> 02:08:06.600]  to go out with this, I'll take a few calls but I want to go out with Crazy, about two
[02:08:06.600 --> 02:08:07.600]  minutes of it.
[02:08:07.600 --> 02:08:13.200]  You don't think, well that's Narls Barkley, he's black, so I'm not going to listen to
[02:08:13.200 --> 02:08:18.680]  that, you hear that soul, that's a human, that's your brother right there, but you tune
[02:08:18.680 --> 02:08:25.880]  in to CNN, all it is is white people are out to get you, and you know the plan, it's to
[02:08:25.880 --> 02:08:31.880]  turn whites into racists, so they can then be political donors to the system, and we
[02:08:31.880 --> 02:08:37.400]  don't want that, we want to stop this crap right now, and that's why Trump's saying,
[02:08:37.400 --> 02:08:41.160]  you're beautiful, you're an American, you're a human, you're beautiful, we're all together,
[02:08:41.160 --> 02:08:46.640]  and they howl and say he's the enemy, when Trump's like the second coming of Martin
[02:08:46.640 --> 02:08:54.320]  Luther King, and his whole life's been that, and I'm not defending Trump, but they had
[02:08:54.320 --> 02:09:00.520]  all these old racist rich golf clubs and tennis clubs across the country, they were going
[02:09:00.520 --> 02:09:09.040]  bankrupt that were run by 100 year old senile racist people, and Trump went and bought them
[02:09:09.040 --> 02:09:14.240]  up, and then he opened them up to everybody, whether you were a rich Japanese guy or a rich
[02:09:14.240 --> 02:09:21.520]  black guy or a rich white guy, he didn't care, because he was a free market guy, and that's
[02:09:21.520 --> 02:09:25.880]  all the rappers love Trump, while he was the coolest guy, because he had all these rappers
[02:09:25.880 --> 02:09:32.480]  stay at his house, made him breakfast himself, in his house, his robe, and then all those
[02:09:32.480 --> 02:09:36.080]  people like Snoop Dogg that stayed at Trump's house, I know he did, I told people that saw
[02:09:36.080 --> 02:09:42.120]  it, piss on him and call him a racist, when he had you to his house, and had you play
[02:09:42.120 --> 02:09:48.920]  at his clubs and made you money, you're a piece of crap Snoop Dogg, and all those other
[02:09:48.920 --> 02:09:53.120]  people that made me sick, all right, Jimmy's phone cut out because he was cussing, we hang
[02:09:53.120 --> 02:09:56.720]  up on folks when they do that, we don't like to lay at once, so I want to hear what you
[02:09:56.720 --> 02:09:59.880]  had to say, you call back in, I'm glad you did, please don't cuss, Jimmy, what's your
[02:09:59.880 --> 02:10:06.120]  view on all the stuff that's coming and what's happening with the Mueller report?
[02:10:06.120 --> 02:10:11.000]  I think the truth is already out, and Trump just need to go after them, the Democrats
[02:10:11.000 --> 02:10:15.160]  is just full of lies, that's all they're going to do is continue the lie, and try to divide
[02:10:15.160 --> 02:10:19.480]  the country more, we need to go after them, we need to deploy the military, arrest them,
[02:10:19.480 --> 02:10:23.120]  and prosecute them, that's what we need to do, and let me say that, I don't like police
[02:10:23.120 --> 02:10:26.760]  state or martial law, they're exactly, they're not going to stop, so what are we just going
[02:10:26.760 --> 02:10:29.840]  to sit here and wait for them to do more stuff?
[02:10:29.840 --> 02:10:33.600]  And we're not going to survive this, we're not going to survive this fucking cancer if
[02:10:33.600 --> 02:10:37.600]  we don't get rid of the tumor, sorry about that, we're not.
[02:10:37.600 --> 02:10:42.200]  One more time, we got to let you go, I want to hear you, but you can't say we can't survive
[02:10:42.200 --> 02:10:45.480]  this effing cancer, let him call back in, Jimmy, can you hear me?
[02:10:45.480 --> 02:10:47.280]  Yeah, I can hear you.
[02:10:47.280 --> 02:10:51.000]  Don't cuss again, you're a smart guy, you don't need to cuss, we can't do it on FCC
[02:10:51.000 --> 02:10:52.000]  stations.
[02:10:52.000 --> 02:10:56.000]  I agree, the Democrats can cuss on TV, Trump can, we can't, we're not as good as they are,
[02:10:56.000 --> 02:10:59.760]  what is your, I agree, gut level, I don't want to war with the Democrats, they're already
[02:10:59.760 --> 02:11:03.600]  attacking us, they won't stop, so what do we do?
[02:11:03.600 --> 02:11:07.600]  We need to go after them, we're already at war, Alex is already at war, the war has begun,
[02:11:07.600 --> 02:11:11.960]  it started, we're in battle, there's no surrender, it's to the death, we need to take them out,
[02:11:11.960 --> 02:11:14.680]  we've got to arrest them, we've got to go after them, we've got to prosecute them, that's
[02:11:14.680 --> 02:11:15.680]  the only way to prosecute them.
[02:11:15.680 --> 02:11:19.720]  Well, the president, the president and Stephen Miller, and they listen, the Pentagon listens,
[02:11:19.720 --> 02:11:21.760]  what do you want them to do?
[02:11:21.760 --> 02:11:26.200]  They need to deploy the military and round them up, we've got the evidence, it's there,
[02:11:26.200 --> 02:11:32.200]  there's nothing else to wait for, we've been waiting for two years, the biggest hoax ever.
[02:11:32.200 --> 02:11:35.880]  Well it's true, they're not stopping and they're still trying to overthrow the country and
[02:11:35.880 --> 02:11:39.680]  they're trying to cause eternal the news, it's all race war, it's just crazy, and all
[02:11:39.680 --> 02:11:43.280]  Americans want, Jimmy is a living piece, right?
[02:11:43.280 --> 02:11:53.280]  Yes, all we want to do is live in peace, no matter what color you all, people are one.
[02:11:53.280 --> 02:11:56.440]  The problem is Trump is surrounded by so many traitors, he would do the right thing, but
[02:11:56.440 --> 02:12:01.160]  he, well I don't know, I don't know what you do when there's all these cowards bred up
[02:12:01.160 --> 02:12:07.520]  in the swamp, mainly, I'll just say it, it's all a bunch of weird white people, a bunch
[02:12:07.520 --> 02:12:12.520]  of weird crazy Harvard educated white people that are out preaching race war because they
[02:12:12.520 --> 02:12:17.200]  want to control things, and I don't know what we do about it, I just, I don't know what
[02:12:17.200 --> 02:12:23.680]  we do about it, because I sit there and I watch Nadler and all these people and I just
[02:12:23.680 --> 02:12:30.000]  don't know, God bless you Jimmy, good points, I mean they are up to their eyeballs with
[02:12:30.000 --> 02:12:36.000]  foreign governments, I have zero connection to foreign governments, Trump has zero connections,
[02:12:36.000 --> 02:12:40.320]  you don't even, you think Trump trusts people in his own government, much less he's going
[02:12:40.320 --> 02:12:47.840]  to go in a hotel and have Russian women piss on him?
[02:12:47.840 --> 02:12:58.120]  Of course it turned out to be fake, but where do they go next?
[02:12:58.120 --> 02:13:00.320]  What do they do next?
[02:13:00.320 --> 02:13:05.360]  You know, I'll say this, one reason I haven't gotten violent is that all these globalists
[02:13:05.360 --> 02:13:11.880]  are nothing but targets, they're just minions, you could kill a thousand globalist minions
[02:13:11.880 --> 02:13:17.000]  that wouldn't do a damn thing, it's a spirit, you kill it in your heart with God, I'm telling
[02:13:17.000 --> 02:13:23.200]  you, the most important thing I've said in 24 years on air, that's what I'm going to
[02:13:23.200 --> 02:13:28.320]  say right now, you don't kill the globalists putting a bullet to their head or breaking
[02:13:28.320 --> 02:13:33.520]  their neck, and they're coming at you and your family, you got to do it, and I say defend
[02:13:33.520 --> 02:13:40.880]  yourself and don't hesitate, but you kill them by loving God and being a good man, a
[02:13:40.880 --> 02:13:49.400]  good woman, and not letting them intimidate you and speaking out, and that's what it comes
[02:13:49.400 --> 02:13:50.400]  down to.
[02:13:50.400 --> 02:13:58.400]  All right, I've just been holding the next longest here, let's go ahead and talk to Robert
[02:13:58.400 --> 02:14:01.600]  and Marilyn, you're on the air, Robert, thanks for holding, go ahead.
[02:14:01.600 --> 02:14:06.920]  Alex, thank you for taking my call, good to talk to you brother, it's good to talk to
[02:14:06.920 --> 02:14:13.040]  you brother, do you remember the defense intelligence that I sent you, I think it's even, I've even
[02:14:13.040 --> 02:14:19.480]  stepped it up, I think the next defense intelligence that you need to sell banners, and you need
[02:14:19.480 --> 02:14:26.680]  to efficiently use the info wars arm and have every one of them have their own mini banner
[02:14:26.680 --> 02:14:30.680]  that they can hang up everywhere, no I agree, people need to get out the streets, that's
[02:14:30.680 --> 02:14:33.680]  the answer to censorship.
[02:14:33.680 --> 02:14:40.200]  And I think with this Mueller report, we need to take this victory in stride, and we need
[02:14:40.200 --> 02:14:45.800]  to go, we need to march forward towards 2020, after we win the election, we can take care
[02:14:45.800 --> 02:14:51.360]  of all these jackals and hyenas.
[02:14:51.360 --> 02:14:56.160]  I just don't know why everybody's so paralyzed, at a gut level, if the patriots in our government
[02:14:56.160 --> 02:15:01.720]  move against the traitors, they're gonna fold like a house of cards, and I just think it's
[02:15:01.720 --> 02:15:10.080]  the safest course, it's not safe for me to say it, but I've already called for covert
[02:15:10.080 --> 02:15:14.160]  action against the democrats, they're sold out to foreign powers, they're criminal, I'm
[02:15:14.160 --> 02:15:19.280]  not gonna do it myself, that's not my forte, even though I can do it, no problem, we're
[02:15:19.280 --> 02:15:23.160]  gonna go break them back with two minutes of this, and I'll come back to you sir, and
[02:15:23.160 --> 02:15:29.160]  I'm not running my mouth, everybody knows that, these people are a joke, they're very
[02:15:29.160 --> 02:15:35.160]  easy to beat, you just gotta have the will to do it, I'm gonna play some of Narls Barclay
[02:15:35.160 --> 02:15:55.840]  and come back to you sir, I tell you, I knew too much.

[02:20:36.160 --> 02:20:53.160]  get it up, you'll never hate somebody for their race, you'll never hate an unborn child, you
[02:20:53.160 --> 02:21:00.160]  go straight to hell, that goes for all the black racists and white racists and all of
[02:21:00.160 --> 02:21:16.160]  that, crank it up, that's my only advice, that's my only advice, you think you're in control,
[02:21:16.160 --> 02:21:31.160]  who do you, who do you, who do you think you are, bless your heart, bless your soul, you
[02:21:31.160 --> 02:21:46.160]  all are."
[02:21:46.160 --> 02:21:57.160]  Possibly, all through my life, the heroes of the advanced, who are they?
[02:21:57.160 --> 02:22:25.160]  I want to be like them, I want to be like them, ever since I was little, ever since I was little, it looked like fun, if there's no coincidence I've come, and I can die when I'm done, and I can die when I'm done, that's right.
[02:22:25.160 --> 02:22:41.160]  I want to carry out the mission, because that made me crazy, because Narls Barclays had a blueprint, he transcended fear, he became born again, oh I'm crazy.
[02:22:55.160 --> 02:23:05.160]  That's good stuff right there.
[02:23:05.160 --> 02:23:19.160]  All right, back to your phone calls, and then I'll hit the vaccine news on the other side, which I think you already know, but you understand the burden, the frustration, how much I hate myself.
[02:23:19.160 --> 02:23:32.160]  That I don't do a good enough job preparing to explain how important this is, that's why I do the theatrics, because if you're just like, oh by the way, here's a diamond in the rough, nobody cares.
[02:23:32.160 --> 02:23:40.160]  If you say, oh here's the big news, nobody cares, but if you build it up, maybe folks care, maybe kids don't get brain damaged.
[02:23:40.160 --> 02:23:53.160]  Main little boys, you know, we brain damaged our little boys, because deep down we're used to men getting killed and used to loveless or smart.
[02:23:53.160 --> 02:24:01.160]  You know, if one in 58 little girls couldn't change their diaper when they were 20 years old, we'd do something about it wouldn't we?
[02:24:01.160 --> 02:24:06.160]  But our little boys need to stick their chins up and tough it out don't they?
[02:24:06.160 --> 02:24:22.160]  Yeah, that's not sick. I'll be honest with you, I got a 16 year old son who's super handsome and 6'2 already and super smart and first in his class, and I just genetically don't worry about him.
[02:24:22.160 --> 02:24:33.160]  My three daughters are so spoiled. The only thing I think about, see that's genetic, because he's a man, he's not a woman.
[02:24:33.160 --> 02:24:43.160]  Think about that. Think about how we treat our men. That's okay though, that's what men are supposed to be treated like.
[02:24:43.160 --> 02:24:51.160]  But they do this sick alchemy of trying to clean women or men when men are men and women are women and everybody knows it.
[02:24:51.160 --> 02:25:11.160]  And the great crime is saying we're not the same thing because the magic of the man and the woman in that holy alchemy creating a new creature is something the devil hates.
[02:25:11.160 --> 02:25:23.160]  And I watch so many people I've known who've joined the dark side, who've joined Lucifer believing that they would be given some type of enlightenment.
[02:25:23.160 --> 02:25:32.160]  And all they're given is bondage to the system they signed on to and there's always more demands.
[02:25:32.160 --> 02:25:43.160]  Not the devil. God doesn't make more demands. You want to give yourself to God. God always says are you sure you want to do that?
[02:25:43.160 --> 02:25:51.160]  Not the devil. The devil says you're going to do that. And so that's all I'm saying is people better choose which side they're on.
[02:25:51.160 --> 02:26:02.160]  We've got Stacy and we've got Gary and we've got Jacob and we've got Bob and we've got Danny and we've got Berger who's been holding Berger.
[02:26:02.160 --> 02:26:08.160]  Been holding for an hour and 11 minutes in California. Welcome Berger. Thank you for calling.
[02:26:08.160 --> 02:26:21.160]  Right, Alex. I want to talk to you for a minute. I just want to say, like I said, the real reporters all fake. And like I said, what they're doing is they're playing with 300 million people lives out here.
[02:26:21.160 --> 02:26:29.160]  That's how many real Americans are out here. But from that report alone, I got didn't care friends all over Facebook and they just steady believing it.
[02:26:29.160 --> 02:26:40.160]  It's been two years. And the point is, the military has to step in. Like the other policy, they have to step in. And like I said, they don't build this border wall.
[02:26:40.160 --> 02:26:50.160]  We've been compromised. And I got this a little rude about the British invasion. This is the truth. We don't need just a border wall on the southern side.
[02:26:50.160 --> 02:26:59.160]  We need one on the northern side, too, because the movies are pouring in. Well, yeah. And again, it's not the British people. But yeah, the British imperial model is manipulating this.
[02:26:59.160 --> 02:27:08.160]  That's exactly what's going on. Exactly what's going on. That's what we're trying to tell people. But like I said, they've been on this country since it was founded by George Washington.
[02:27:08.160 --> 02:27:16.160]  That's the whole point. So what happened was we've just been assassinating presidents. And like I said, just taking over the military.
[02:27:16.160 --> 02:27:24.160]  And I just think we broke down completely. Everything's insulted. China, the infrastructure is gone. I mean, you can see this from your own eyes.
[02:27:24.160 --> 02:27:30.160]  And how crazy is it to watch Trump trying to just do basic good and being opposed?
[02:27:30.160 --> 02:27:41.160]  Listen, I pray for Trump. I didn't even know he was going to be in office. I told my wife before he was even thinking about running, I said, unless we get a border wall, this is the only way we're going to survive.
[02:27:41.160 --> 02:27:48.160]  This is the only way. And I've seen what they did to Europe. I've seen how they pulled the Africans in and how they just led them. And it's unbelievable.
[02:27:48.160 --> 02:27:54.160]  It's the same thing happening here. And we can't tell that. And the military came. It's just ridiculous.
[02:27:54.160 --> 02:28:05.160]  No, they know. They know. They know. So it's, it's, it's crazy. And to see how many Americans are against the country really, it makes me sad.
[02:28:05.160 --> 02:28:13.160]  You come to California, we don't lost a lot of black lives over here due to this Democrat invasion that they've brought on us. And we was on, we were on the front lines.
[02:28:13.160 --> 02:28:21.160]  Well, if they didn't even know more black people kind of left, they lost Angela. They didn't have thought of us so much to where our, our games won't even exist if we haven't.
[02:28:21.160 --> 02:28:30.160]  It's over. I mean, we, they've been murdering us, getting away with it. They, they cross back to the border. We can't do that. We cannot do that.
[02:28:30.160 --> 02:28:42.160]  They keep coming over. Brother, this is world war four. This is the, this is it. This is the tech down America. And we got a president trying to do something, but he's not, he's not going hard enough.
[02:28:42.160 --> 02:29:02.160]  Man, these Democrats need to be politically dealt with. They need to be wiped out. They're not Americans. They went over the line. They drew first blood.

[02:32:55.560 --> 02:33:03.960]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[02:33:25.560 --> 02:33:34.840]  That's Merle Haggard, who by the way was a big listener and I'm not gonna get into
[02:33:34.840 --> 02:33:39.200]  private stories but we almost got him on the show but he just didn't come on you
[02:33:39.200 --> 02:33:42.000]  know I'm not name-dropping because I really don't care about famous people
[02:33:42.000 --> 02:33:47.520]  unless they're Willie Nelson and I got to be pretty good friends with Willie
[02:33:47.520 --> 02:33:53.480]  Nelson because they thought I didn't like Bush and as soon as Obama got in his
[02:33:53.480 --> 02:34:00.440]  wife flipped out on me when I was at his house and Willie apologized but you know
[02:34:00.440 --> 02:34:05.320]  it's okay I guess like his fifth wife but you know the Willie Nelson you see it
[02:34:05.320 --> 02:34:08.960]  86 on the road is not the real Willie Nelson that guy's like a wind-up toy
[02:34:08.960 --> 02:34:16.120]  now they put up there on the put up there on stage but I'm not a marijuana
[02:34:16.120 --> 02:34:20.560]  smoker but about 15 years ago first time hanging out Willie Nelson on his bus
[02:34:20.560 --> 02:34:24.360]  he's got a vapor before we'd ever seen him it was like this big to call a
[02:34:24.360 --> 02:34:29.600]  volcano it's got this big ball on it and it's the only he's like he goes here I'm
[02:34:29.600 --> 02:34:33.800]  gonna take a hit off this is he goes take some it's like a spit stripping off
[02:34:33.800 --> 02:34:37.440]  of it it's like a peace pipe and I'm like I've never had a dude spit in my mouth
[02:34:37.440 --> 02:34:41.760]  it's the gas thing I ever did but I took it and meanwhile I'm crawling through
[02:34:41.760 --> 02:34:47.160]  the parking lot two hours later had to call somebody to come get me because the
[02:34:47.160 --> 02:34:51.080]  weed was so strong so I guess that's why they said they're gonna roll him up and
[02:34:51.080 --> 02:34:55.520]  smoke him now I'd known when Nelson five years before that photo was taken right
[02:34:55.520 --> 02:35:00.840]  there that's me and Jesse Ventura with Willie Nelson his house he's got his own
[02:35:00.840 --> 02:35:05.880]  little town called Luck outside Austin much old buildings shoots bunch of
[02:35:05.880 --> 02:35:09.840]  movies out there but that was when he was like 75 years old I meant Willie
[02:35:09.840 --> 02:35:17.360]  Nelson he's about 70 he's 86 now so don't even long time so that's not name
[02:35:17.360 --> 02:35:23.560]  dropping I don't care about Hollywood people but Willie Nelson a little
[02:35:23.560 --> 02:35:28.560]  different because there's like three different types of people in the area
[02:35:28.560 --> 02:35:32.560]  Texas he's from my family from the county right next to his county there's
[02:35:32.560 --> 02:35:37.240]  kind of a nice friendly Scott type guys with long hair they're real friendly but
[02:35:37.240 --> 02:35:40.480]  they're actually tough guys like Willie Nelson that's kind of a big old boba
[02:35:40.480 --> 02:35:45.880]  jock types the Chad types and there's kind of a church going types but just
[02:35:45.880 --> 02:35:50.600]  Willie Nelson so much like my family all my people I know most of them are dead
[02:35:50.600 --> 02:35:59.440]  now old great uncles all the rest of it's just weird to know Willie Nelson and
[02:35:59.440 --> 02:36:07.720]  know he's a good guy you know Willie Nelson sought me out I was showing in
[02:36:07.720 --> 02:36:13.080]  game I talked to him before many ones for but I was showing in game like 12
[02:36:13.080 --> 02:36:23.040]  years ago that's what he came on the air and people are I gave a speech if you
[02:36:23.040 --> 02:36:27.680]  like Willie Nelson in the back he was talk to him he goes oh I met you for
[02:36:27.680 --> 02:36:30.440]  like what you're doing you come over to my house someone come on show I'm like
[02:36:30.440 --> 02:36:33.800]  okay sure here's my number yeah right then Willie Nelson starts calling me and
[02:36:33.800 --> 02:36:38.080]  man when I had his numbers I could call him up he talked for like an hour got a
[02:36:38.080 --> 02:36:45.080]  real guy you know but he just believes in bleeding heart bullshit bulls bull
[02:36:45.080 --> 02:36:50.600]  hucky because he hears beat oh and Bernie Sanders say we're gonna get right
[02:36:50.600 --> 02:36:57.960]  to free stuff and he goes I sounds like good day there and he's giving away
[02:36:57.960 --> 02:37:03.160]  almost every bit of his money I remember like 15 years ago he goes you know
[02:37:03.160 --> 02:37:07.160]  you're doing good work exposed in 9-11 he goes you need any money I'll just
[02:37:07.160 --> 02:37:12.800]  write you a check how much you need couple hundred thousand and I was like
[02:37:12.800 --> 02:37:23.080]  mr. Nelson I don't want your money let's see that's what the leftist do is they
[02:37:23.080 --> 02:37:29.600]  manipulate good-hearted people like Willie look at Willie that's a good
[02:37:29.600 --> 02:37:36.880]  hearted person a photo with Pito or Oregon Pito's a big-ass predator so it
[02:37:36.880 --> 02:37:47.640]  just makes me sick sometimes but that wasn't a name-dropping story I guess
[02:37:47.640 --> 02:37:51.040]  we're coming in with country music so I got into that maybe we should intro the
[02:37:51.040 --> 02:37:59.480]  next segment with the little Waylon Jennings not looking back Texas is good
[02:37:59.480 --> 02:38:07.200]  too but there's only two things in this world that make it worth living guitars
[02:38:07.200 --> 02:38:15.560]  that tune good and firm feeling women I think that's probably true no it's that
[02:38:15.560 --> 02:38:21.840]  live rendition of Silver Stallion the part where it's queued up to Waylon
[02:38:21.840 --> 02:38:27.000]  Jennings I'm gonna find me a reckless woman with razor blades and dice in her
[02:38:27.000 --> 02:38:32.040]  eyes and just a touch of sadness in her fingers and thunder and lightning in her
[02:38:32.040 --> 02:38:38.760]  thighs who comes up with stuff like that it's totally true I'm gonna find me a
[02:38:38.760 --> 02:38:47.400]  reckless woman with razor blades and dice and just a touch of sadness in her
[02:38:47.400 --> 02:38:51.960]  fingers and thunder and lightning in her thighs
[02:38:51.960 --> 02:38:57.280]  callers been holding long enough here when you got 30 phone lines it's everybody's
[02:38:57.280 --> 02:39:00.640]  got a hole so I appreciate everybody Danny in Virginia you're on the air
[02:39:00.640 --> 02:39:07.640]  welcome to the airwaves go ahead hey Alex thanks for all you do you and thank
[02:39:07.640 --> 02:39:11.440]  you to your crew and thank you to you for being in the crosshairs and happy to
[02:39:11.440 --> 02:39:15.800]  be there I love it anyway I think what we're all
[02:39:15.800 --> 02:39:19.240]  stumbling over is what mr. Trump needs to do and he needs to be the first
[02:39:19.240 --> 02:39:23.800]  president to recognize that the United States Constitution was suspended more
[02:39:23.800 --> 02:39:26.920]  than a hundred years ago and he should use that to his advantage and become the
[02:39:26.920 --> 02:39:32.480]  triumphant dictator no you're right we're under a bureaucratic dictatorship so
[02:39:32.480 --> 02:39:35.680]  when I call for Trump to be dictator it's only the end the dictatorship which
[02:39:35.680 --> 02:39:39.920]  is very smart of you to say that right and you need to be the intellectual
[02:39:39.920 --> 02:39:43.840]  leader of the movement to get him on that that point and say mr. president
[02:39:43.840 --> 02:39:47.440]  have to recognize that the only way we win this is to win it quickly it's got
[02:39:47.440 --> 02:39:51.200]  to be a blitzkrieg you got to take these people into custody overnight and he's
[02:39:51.200 --> 02:39:55.120]  the only top of leader like Washington who at Washington signed thousands of
[02:39:55.120 --> 02:39:59.200]  death warrants he's the only person will turn it loose once he's done it right I
[02:39:59.200 --> 02:40:02.040]  don't want death warrants I just want people locked up and I want them
[02:40:02.040 --> 02:40:07.000]  coerced into confessing as to working for the globalist let's be honest and
[02:40:07.000 --> 02:40:11.200]  death warrants are quicker I know but but we need the confession we need these
[02:40:11.200 --> 02:40:14.840]  people to admit what they were up to and the way you kill a globalist is to take
[02:40:14.840 --> 02:40:19.160]  their children into protective custody if you own their bloodline you own them
[02:40:19.160 --> 02:40:23.840]  no I agree and most their children are 4550 are involved in the crime now I
[02:40:23.840 --> 02:40:28.040]  here's the other try to destroy me I know they are I don't sell this of be
[02:40:28.040 --> 02:40:32.000]  like a big big shoot my mouth off this will be on the news tonight I agree man
[02:40:32.000 --> 02:40:35.040]  this is a foreign criminal group we need to move against them so what do you
[02:40:35.040 --> 02:40:41.320]  think Trump should do well I mean first thing I would do is I have a the Senate
[02:40:41.320 --> 02:40:45.760]  call Mueller before them and have him answer how long did he have this
[02:40:45.760 --> 02:40:48.520]  determination that there was no collusion now how long did he know when
[02:40:48.520 --> 02:40:53.120]  was his first meeting with Rosenstein and coming right but but he clearly held
[02:40:53.120 --> 02:40:57.000]  this this report until after the midterm elections he knew there was no
[02:40:57.000 --> 02:41:01.480]  collusion eight ten months ago that's right he modeled in the 2018 election
[02:41:01.480 --> 02:41:06.120]  exactly if you make that case publicly before the Senate then this whole thing
[02:41:06.120 --> 02:41:12.200]  withers away that this whole thing wasn't political so sap the energy out of
[02:41:12.200 --> 02:41:15.040]  that because they're never gonna let go of it well I agree you know I'm not a
[02:41:15.040 --> 02:41:21.040]  violent person but I know how many people deep state have killed they were
[02:41:21.040 --> 02:41:26.000]  seen as disruptive what do you think of the globalist we're not calling for
[02:41:26.000 --> 02:41:29.360]  this we're we're not violent what if the globalist got a bloody nose would you
[02:41:29.360 --> 02:41:33.080]  think they might go away or no they can't help it there is no way they're
[02:41:33.080 --> 02:41:36.840]  gonna go away that's just not in their nature they're they're just like
[02:41:36.840 --> 02:41:40.240]  parasites that need a host they just have to be able to feed on us they're
[02:41:40.240 --> 02:41:45.880]  right they're robotic they're not higher order right but I love what you do and
[02:41:45.880 --> 02:41:49.360]  keep doing it no no let me hear more from you don't don't hang up Danny so no I
[02:41:49.360 --> 02:41:56.120]  mean I agree we so what is Trump need to do he needs to what's he do well I mean
[02:41:56.120 --> 02:42:04.040]  we have to we have to certainly it's like Narls Barkley we got to get crazy
[02:42:04.040 --> 02:42:07.320]  we got to let him know that we have formed a weapon against them that they
[02:42:07.320 --> 02:42:11.480]  can't overcome that we're gonna go where we have to go to get this done you have
[02:42:11.480 --> 02:42:13.800]  to threaten them with something that they actually believe could be done to
[02:42:13.800 --> 02:42:18.440]  them and I agree I mean how arrogant are they to be all over the news saying
[02:42:18.440 --> 02:42:21.320]  they're gonna impeach the president when they're the ones caught trying to
[02:42:21.320 --> 02:42:24.960]  overthrow an election it's just they're just a bunch and all the lies they've
[02:42:24.960 --> 02:42:29.240]  told I mean my god I bet you could invalidate all of the elections over the
[02:42:29.240 --> 02:42:34.200]  last hundred years just saying that the money aspect of of electioneering is
[02:42:34.200 --> 02:42:39.680]  bribery it's all let me make an announcement when we come back Danny but
[02:42:39.680 --> 02:42:43.600]  I I'm betting on Trump I think Trump knows existentially they're gonna
[02:42:43.600 --> 02:42:56.040]  destroy him unless he does what must be done do what must be done

[02:45:05.760 --> 02:45:08.960]  tip of the spear of the zeitgeist that's what a globalist are obsessed with it
[02:45:08.960 --> 02:45:13.000]  trying to shut it down I didn't invent all this I went and researched the

[02:45:17.520 --> 02:45:21.720]  to bring it back and lo and behold it's super popular like it's always been
[02:45:21.720 --> 02:45:26.440]  that's what the globalist are trying to shut it down so desperately because we
[02:45:26.440 --> 02:45:30.640]  have the light in the dark of the night that's since chills up my spine so
[02:45:30.640 --> 02:45:34.640]  whatever you do continue to support yourself and info wars by buying the
[02:45:34.640 --> 02:45:38.000]  great products in infowarstore.com by spreading the articles by spreading the
[02:45:38.000 --> 02:45:42.040]  videos and by praying for this operation and for praying for this nation and the
[02:45:42.040 --> 02:45:46.160]  world for peace and discernment for myself and the whole info wars family I
[02:45:46.160 --> 02:45:51.120]  want to thank all of you for what you've done because without you info wars is
[02:45:51.120 --> 02:45:58.280]  nothing you are the info war and I salute you I want to say brain force is
[02:45:58.280 --> 02:46:02.040]  great I want to say turbo force is amazing it is but if you took it with
[02:46:02.040 --> 02:46:07.400]  fish oil it's like the fish oil is it the fish oil is better than it and
[02:46:07.400 --> 02:46:11.880]  that's an example of what I'm talking about fish oil is liquid energy brain
[02:46:11.880 --> 02:46:16.240]  body heart the cleanest the best out there you've got the children's you've
[02:46:16.240 --> 02:46:19.460]  got the adults you've got the krill oil if you're gonna get the full effect the
[02:46:19.460 --> 02:46:22.440]  fish oil and the children's are really strong they don't give you the burpees
[02:46:22.440 --> 02:46:26.480]  but krill oil is the best and it'll give you the damn burps and I'm sorry you
[02:46:26.480 --> 02:46:29.800]  want something like this you don't get stuff for free the krill is hallucinogenic
[02:46:29.800 --> 02:46:33.200]  it's so good in my view I'm not a medical statement here but let me tell
[02:46:33.200 --> 02:46:37.000]  you something I eat five capillates of krill oil before I go to bed I'm seeing
[02:46:37.000 --> 02:46:46.560]  Santa Claus that night so your brain is made basically out of what fish oil is
[02:46:46.560 --> 02:46:50.600]  so we don't make a big profit off of it but you know as I just obsess cuz
[02:46:50.600 --> 02:46:56.120]  whatever the best is we've got I just can't lie to you I just can't do it
[02:46:56.120 --> 02:47:16.000]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[02:47:26.120 --> 02:47:35.560]  I'm gonna find me a reckless woman humanity's been through a hell of a lot
[02:47:35.560 --> 02:47:42.200]  together we're pretty damn cool here's to you humanity I'm gonna find me a
[02:47:42.200 --> 02:47:52.040]  reckless woman razor blades and I said nothing better than a reckless woman
[02:47:52.040 --> 02:48:05.280]  just a touch of sadness center finger thunder and lightning and that's the
[02:48:05.280 --> 02:48:11.680]  live version it's good song you know I got here today and I had all these clips
[02:48:11.680 --> 02:48:14.640]  and all this news and I basically covered none of it I've covered the
[02:48:14.640 --> 02:48:18.200]  Mueller report I've covered how they're gonna strike back while they're so
[02:48:18.200 --> 02:48:26.560]  arrogant and just what a bunch of crap the globalist are and I'm just gonna
[02:48:26.560 --> 02:48:37.560]  say this to listeners you know people tell me they say don't tell the globalist
[02:48:37.560 --> 02:48:45.320]  what's going on with you but see I don't get a parent lie see imagine I don't
[02:48:45.320 --> 02:48:49.040]  plan any of this if I tried to lie to you what that would be like I can't lie
[02:48:49.040 --> 02:48:58.400]  to myself so I'll be honest with folks we plan to expand last year they fall
[02:48:58.400 --> 02:49:02.320]  20-something lawsuits honestly taking our sponsors bank accounts harassed the
[02:49:02.320 --> 02:49:08.520]  hell out of us you stood up for us and we're still here but I think there's
[02:49:08.520 --> 02:49:13.160]  this idea because the Mueller report and because it looks like Trump's winning
[02:49:13.160 --> 02:49:19.280]  it oh well we're doing good no we're in the middle of the war and so yeah we're
[02:49:19.280 --> 02:49:22.040]  having some big victories but I've just seen the audience just like when
[02:49:22.040 --> 02:49:25.200]  Republican gets elected even other traders a lot of times people just go
[02:49:25.200 --> 02:49:35.120]  to sleep and I don't want to lay people off here and you know I actually pay our
[02:49:35.120 --> 02:49:40.400]  media people and I pay them well about twice what people are paid in Texas but
[02:49:40.400 --> 02:49:44.040]  they pay people almost nothing for media jobs now people on discovery channel
[02:49:44.040 --> 02:49:46.880]  history channel they're like well I used to make big movies 20 years ago but now
[02:49:46.880 --> 02:49:51.760]  I work for free hoping I get a credit on this movie Hollywood's a joke folks
[02:49:51.760 --> 02:49:56.600]  Netflix and a thousand shows a year all of its crap so I get there's a glut of
[02:49:56.600 --> 02:50:03.240]  media but this is a place spend your money info or store.com great books
[02:50:03.240 --> 02:50:07.480]  great films great t-shirts great supplements and if you just go there if
[02:50:07.480 --> 02:50:11.260]  you just buy it you're funding the second American Revolution and you're
[02:50:11.260 --> 02:50:15.640]  standing in defiance of Soros and Hillary and all these losers because
[02:50:15.640 --> 02:50:18.560]  there's a thing we've pretty much beat this wave of the enemy but more waves
[02:50:18.560 --> 02:50:24.760]  are coming and I want to be here to face those future waves someday I won't be
[02:50:24.760 --> 02:50:31.600]  able to do that but I am in your hands and when I say that it's not hyperbole
[02:50:31.600 --> 02:50:39.160]  and a sick level it's almost like I've already fought a couple wars you know I
[02:50:39.160 --> 02:50:50.520]  could eject out of here but I passed that point a long time ago I can't stop
[02:50:50.520 --> 02:51:06.520]  now and so I'm in God's hands and God works through you and so I can sit here
[02:51:06.520 --> 02:51:14.760]  and ask you to financially support us but at the end of the day we all really
[02:51:14.760 --> 02:51:21.560]  know that is what matters doesn't really matter doesn't what matters is the
[02:51:21.560 --> 02:51:30.160]  decision you make about your soul and if your soul is pointed to God you're gonna
[02:51:30.160 --> 02:51:35.440]  make the right decision regardless but I know so many people watch and listen
[02:51:35.440 --> 02:51:39.920]  despite the censorship new numbers are which I don't even want to announce this
[02:51:39.920 --> 02:51:45.800]  we're smart people I listen to go down with Jones don't don't don't don't don't
[02:51:45.800 --> 02:51:55.120]  don't announce this I can't help it we're reaching more people than we ever
[02:51:55.120 --> 02:52:05.400]  have on third party sites and it's not on the few little outposts we have it's
[02:52:05.400 --> 02:52:13.160]  through the public taking actions that's beautiful the byproduct is that
[02:52:13.160 --> 02:52:20.000]  they're not the type of listeners that buy stuff so we're winning the ethereal
[02:52:20.000 --> 02:52:25.480]  war of minds like never before it's like Super Mario Brothers when you get the
[02:52:25.480 --> 02:52:31.360]  mushroom and you're like invincible we're at that point but back at the real
[02:52:31.360 --> 02:52:38.440]  world home base feast or famine best of times worst of times tell your cities
[02:52:38.440 --> 02:52:45.640]  financially we're not doing well so put it on your calendar mark it down your
[02:52:45.640 --> 02:52:49.760]  ledger however you do it shine a ferato ship whatever you do we got stuff you
[02:52:49.760 --> 02:52:55.320]  need and Lord I'm not judging you I know I go to box stores myself and I'm busy
[02:52:55.320 --> 02:52:59.480]  or whatever I'm not blaming you I stand established with hotels if I'm busy you
[02:52:59.480 --> 02:53:03.520]  don't have time to find a mom and pop hell air and B&B's banned us having
[02:53:03.520 --> 02:53:10.760]  made that announcement yet trust in people's houses but we need your
[02:53:10.760 --> 02:53:15.680]  financial support we just need folks to make that commitment and realize they're
[02:53:15.680 --> 02:53:18.600]  changing the world a lot of you've done it a lot of you hadn't and I appreciate
[02:53:18.600 --> 02:53:28.280]  you alright he's been home the longest here Marcos in Texas or is it oh my god
[02:53:28.280 --> 02:53:32.280]  it's Gary in Virginia Gary in Virginia come on down thanks for holding you're
[02:53:32.280 --> 02:53:38.000]  on the air how you doing mr. Jones I'm happy you're in a pig in the mirror
[02:53:38.000 --> 02:53:46.480]  brother that's one of my stains too look I'm a first-time caller but I haven't
[02:53:46.480 --> 02:53:53.480]  known about y'all for probably seven or eight years but this thing we were all
[02:53:53.480 --> 02:53:57.480]  talking about deep down in you you know that you know all this is happening I've
[02:53:57.480 --> 02:54:01.880]  known for you know actually ever since I've been a little boy that this day is
[02:54:01.880 --> 02:54:11.360]  coming and and where I see we're at today is like you know info wars is out
[02:54:11.360 --> 02:54:15.680]  there fighting and they're doing what they're supposed to do and yes they
[02:54:15.680 --> 02:54:22.440]  they are winning the information war and but what I see is which is great
[02:54:22.440 --> 02:54:28.280]  but because you need to wake the people up but on my opinion what I see is this
[02:54:28.280 --> 02:54:36.040]  is exactly what they want anyway I mean the more that it could get turned out
[02:54:36.040 --> 02:54:42.360]  here and the more that their calls can be you know released to the people to
[02:54:42.360 --> 02:54:48.480]  where the people get used to hearing that on an everyday schedule the more
[02:54:48.480 --> 02:54:53.440]  that the people get used to it I totally agree with you it's a paradox because
[02:54:53.440 --> 02:54:57.440]  we expose globalism but by exposing it people just get used to globalism I
[02:54:57.440 --> 02:55:03.200]  agree with you so so how do you deal with that paradox well you know I'm
[02:55:03.200 --> 02:55:11.320]  I'm a I'm a mechanic by trade and and I only know right and wrong and you know
[02:55:11.320 --> 02:55:16.280]  if you if you're going by the well we're all going by this so-called globalist
[02:55:16.280 --> 02:55:23.120]  schedule right now so you said a mechanic is like a mechanical mathematician if
[02:55:23.120 --> 02:55:28.760]  the stuff doesn't line up it doesn't work so what do you think we did I think
[02:55:28.760 --> 02:55:35.200]  what the other caller said we should we should do that immediately and and I
[02:55:35.200 --> 02:55:41.520]  think that as before as another special counsel is concerned look there
[02:55:41.520 --> 02:55:46.080]  they're Washington is used in all these things for excuses they're look at the
[02:55:46.080 --> 02:55:52.840]  level to where we're at but yet the least they're trying to get people on
[02:55:52.840 --> 02:55:57.600]  the least amount instead of just going straight down in because you got the
[02:55:57.600 --> 02:56:02.200]  evidence and no exactly this has been used to cover up the illegal spying the
[02:56:02.200 --> 02:56:06.160]  Mueller report is a cover-up Trump saying it's a victory now he gets it isn't
[02:56:06.160 --> 02:56:12.320]  now it's a blueprint for Congress to go after obstruction no Mueller Comey
[02:56:12.320 --> 02:56:17.320]  McCabe Rosenstein they all committed crimes publicly stop being on the
[02:56:17.320 --> 02:56:23.160]  defense offense now this is this is what I don't understand now I voted for
[02:56:23.160 --> 02:56:28.920]  Trump and I love Trump and I mean and I and I watched every move I've been
[02:56:28.920 --> 02:56:34.400]  watching all these moves as long as you have and and I live he can sleep this
[02:56:34.400 --> 02:56:39.000]  every day I've lost friends over they think I'm crazy you know and oh yeah
[02:56:39.000 --> 02:56:44.240]  being informed is crazy nowadays I know but what what I'm you know what I'm
[02:56:44.240 --> 02:56:51.520]  getting at is these these the people that are in power would see Trump to me
[02:56:51.520 --> 02:56:56.160]  Trump this is one thing that bothered me that Trump did and that what he didn't
[02:56:56.160 --> 02:57:02.040]  do is and I can excuse them it's okay we got 30 seconds tell us what he did well
[02:57:02.040 --> 02:57:08.160]  when he when he got in and Jeff session to recuse himself you know then we went
[02:57:08.160 --> 02:57:12.840]  through two years of all this crap for absolutely nothing here's what I've
[02:57:12.840 --> 02:57:16.600]  learned having a hundred employees and they're great people I don't know what's
[02:57:16.600 --> 02:57:20.640]  going on the next office to me people are loyal or they get the mission or
[02:57:20.640 --> 02:57:26.600]  they don't we got a lot of Trump got pissed at sessions it's like so look
[02:57:26.600 --> 02:57:31.800]  Trump is not God okay and it's up to us to keep pushing but sessions is a weak
[02:57:31.800 --> 02:57:39.200]  broken compromised person and there's a new sheriff in town just Trump caught
[02:57:39.200 --> 02:57:46.680]  him by the short hairs we'd exercise power now if you're not expanding you're
[02:57:46.680 --> 02:57:50.880]  imploding there is no set stasis there is no managed system there is no
[02:57:50.880 --> 02:57:55.920]  uncontenual the continuum is always launching forward in the future so you
[02:57:55.920 --> 02:57:59.560]  support us and get creative and get fired up we won't just be here a hundred
[02:57:59.560 --> 02:58:02.600]  years we'll be here forever we'll turn the whole thing around our grandchildren
[02:58:02.600 --> 02:58:06.960]  on Mars bases and jump bases and God knows what are gonna look back and say
[02:58:06.960 --> 02:58:10.920]  you know that we struggled here we made it and that's really where this goes
[02:58:10.920 --> 02:58:14.800]  but yeah God's got a big war for you ready and so if you can't face George
[02:58:14.800 --> 02:58:18.360]  Soros and Hillary Clinton and Adolf Hitler and Mao Zedong are you gonna
[02:58:18.360 --> 02:58:22.360]  really be able to face the other stuff because God wants warriors that are
[02:58:22.360 --> 02:58:26.240]  smart and ready to build things and are also ready to fight you don't go to the
[02:58:26.240 --> 02:58:29.200]  next level without getting a big weight put on your back and I mean I don't know
[02:58:29.200 --> 02:58:32.960]  what's gonna happen to me in the future I mean all I know is I want to go with
[02:58:32.960 --> 02:58:37.440]  the master built I want to go to the next level I want to be with the spirit
[02:58:37.440 --> 02:58:41.200]  that I've experienced not these devil worshipers they're cold and failed and

[03:00:04.040 --> 03:00:10.240]  you know there's such treason going on and our government's so overrun with
[03:00:10.240 --> 03:00:16.400]  traders that I just don't have words anymore thousands of illegal aliens
[03:00:16.400 --> 03:00:23.840]  were stopped in New Mexico the last three days 350 at a time AP even reports
[03:00:23.840 --> 03:00:28.480]  reports have been up since yesterday I could have led the show with it and
[03:00:28.480 --> 03:00:34.360]  these are all military aged men every 15 men or so have a kid they hold up like
[03:00:34.360 --> 03:00:42.920]  let us in and now the New Mexico government attacks citizen border patrol
[03:00:42.920 --> 03:00:49.400]  after 1,000 interdegrees across the 24 hours and citizens detain them but they
[03:00:49.400 --> 03:00:52.120]  were already just waiting to be picked up by border patrol and taken into the US
[03:00:52.120 --> 03:00:56.960]  because everything's overwhelmed the courts everything and then it's a
[03:00:56.960 --> 03:01:06.280]  telemetry an article they like they're the traders you know I've been down to
[03:01:06.280 --> 03:01:13.440]  Central and South America it's scary as hell and you know Trump tried to get the
[03:01:13.440 --> 03:01:19.880]  beds increased from 90,000 to 200,000 he tried to get 12 billion for a wall they
[03:01:19.880 --> 03:01:26.320]  gave him 1.3 billion because the UN's financing this whole takedown and then
[03:01:26.320 --> 03:01:31.880]  and culture talks about Trump not being tough on the border I'm not defending
[03:01:31.880 --> 03:01:37.840]  Trump it's the Democrats it's the globalist that have advertised the fall
[03:01:37.840 --> 03:01:43.920]  of our country so put the target where it is but see and culture knows if she
[03:01:43.920 --> 03:01:51.080]  talks much trash about the present Google won't block her I'm not even
[03:01:51.080 --> 03:02:00.800]  against and culture I just I just don't get it I just don't get it anymore
[03:02:01.960 --> 03:02:07.240]  yesterday I meant to leave the show with the citizen militia arresting
[03:02:07.240 --> 03:02:11.160]  thousands of illegal aliens didn't do it today because there's so many other big
[03:02:11.160 --> 03:02:21.000]  things going on but that's just crazy that's so crazy Mexico has the tightest
[03:02:21.000 --> 03:02:27.240]  immigration laws in the Western Hemisphere and these aren't Mexicans
[03:02:27.240 --> 03:02:32.280]  being brought in here folks they're all men with the kids they've kidnapped in
[03:02:32.280 --> 03:02:36.640]  many cases that they're bringing in to get that golden ticket all that free
[03:02:36.640 --> 03:02:43.240]  stuff so the Democrats can sign them up to vote us into oblivion you know we had
[03:02:43.240 --> 03:02:47.440]  a bunch of brown people love the Second Amendment and private property and we
[03:02:47.440 --> 03:02:51.360]  could indoctrinate I'd say yeah we need more people but no 90 plus percent are
[03:02:51.360 --> 03:02:57.440]  gonna vote Democrat next year because they come from socialist hellholes they
[03:02:57.440 --> 03:03:00.640]  do what they're told and the group that brings them in is who they're gonna
[03:03:00.640 --> 03:03:13.880]  follow and then our own media looks at 1,000 plus people 1,800 people
[03:03:13.880 --> 03:03:21.400]  everyone's like how the militia subdue them it's citizen arrest you get 300 400
[03:03:21.400 --> 03:03:27.400]  people at a time they all just go oh we made it across amnesty amnesty free
[03:03:27.400 --> 03:03:38.200]  free stuff free goodies wherever the freebies I remember my grandfather and
[03:03:38.200 --> 03:03:41.200]  my grandmother living in South Austin they decided to live in a more frugal
[03:03:41.200 --> 03:03:48.080]  home so they could give more money to churches and charities when they died
[03:03:48.080 --> 03:03:54.680]  we learned they'd given huge sums from West Texas oil fields and inheritances
[03:03:54.680 --> 03:04:00.520]  to churches that's why my grandfather in like 78 years old got audited by the
[03:04:00.520 --> 03:04:04.640]  IRS and they said you owe all this money you haven't paid this money and the fact
[03:04:04.640 --> 03:04:09.040]  that he was such a Puritan he got so hurt by that and he had a heart attack
[03:04:09.040 --> 03:04:18.680]  and then became brain damaged but I just sit back and I and I think about that
[03:04:18.680 --> 03:04:25.360]  and the lawlessness of the system to bring in a hundred thousand people we
[03:04:25.360 --> 03:04:29.480]  know of a month hundreds of thousands we don't a total rush at our border head
[03:04:29.480 --> 03:04:33.560]  of the board patrol says the borders failed and we're all just supposed to
[03:04:33.560 --> 03:04:39.240]  pay for it all but if old people don't pay their income taxes they lose their
[03:04:39.240 --> 03:04:47.160]  house but we got to be nice and give all these people freebies the lowest IQ of
[03:04:47.160 --> 03:04:53.520]  Latin America being brought here what a mess
[03:04:53.520 --> 03:04:57.160]  well I've got some really good news for all the viewers and all the listeners

[03:06:30.400 --> 03:06:34.400]  stopping on the barways
[03:06:34.400 --> 03:06:37.400]  playing rock and roll
[03:06:37.400 --> 03:06:39.400]  getting robbed

[03:06:47.400 --> 03:06:49.400]  getting cooked
[03:06:49.400 --> 03:06:51.400]  I'm here to tell ya
[03:06:51.400 --> 03:06:54.400]  it's harder than it looks
[03:06:54.400 --> 03:06:57.400]  it's harder than it looks
[03:06:57.400 --> 03:06:59.400]  it's harder than it looks
[03:06:59.400 --> 03:07:01.400]  it's harder than it looks
[03:07:01.400 --> 03:07:03.400]  it's harder than it looks
[03:07:03.400 --> 03:07:05.400]  it's harder than it looks
[03:07:08.400 --> 03:07:11.400]  let's go to your phone calls
[03:07:11.400 --> 03:07:14.400]  not a special report coming up you know i said i'd do vaccines
[03:07:14.400 --> 03:07:17.400]  but i just don't know if i'd do it justice
[03:07:17.400 --> 03:07:21.800]  try to deliver on what I say I'll do. We're going to bam, bam, bam through your calls
[03:07:21.800 --> 03:07:29.000]  right now. Stacey in the great state of Texas in Fema Region 6, you're on the air worldwide, Stacey.
[03:07:30.600 --> 03:07:34.600]  Great to talk to you. Before I get into what I want to say, I just want to let you know
[03:07:34.600 --> 03:07:38.440]  that I don't normally take vitamins at all. I was turned on to the Ultimate Female Forest. I
[03:07:38.440 --> 03:07:43.960]  looked at all the ingredients and they're all organic, root, things like that that I trust.
[03:07:43.960 --> 03:07:47.320]  You know, because I've seen a lot of other vitamins. They don't have the things that they
[03:07:47.320 --> 03:07:51.480]  say that they have in them and they're often not things that are natural. I appreciate that.
[03:07:51.480 --> 03:07:53.720]  Well, what happened with Ultimate Female Forest? Tell us about it.
[03:07:54.520 --> 03:07:57.880]  Well, it's really great. You know, it's like a multivitamin. I take it. It tastes good. It
[03:07:57.880 --> 03:08:02.200]  doesn't have that nasty aftertaste. It actually has kind of a pleasant aftertaste and you know,
[03:08:02.200 --> 03:08:05.560]  it just gives me energy and fuels me throughout the day. So I really like it.
[03:08:06.200 --> 03:08:10.200]  Well, just so you know, we look at whatever the best herbs are. They're known to turbo charge
[03:08:10.200 --> 03:08:15.160]  women. And then we get the organic ones and put it in it. So yeah, Ultimate Female Forest has a
[03:08:15.160 --> 03:08:21.400]  100% review on power reviews. No other product actually has that, but it's only got a few reviews.
[03:08:21.960 --> 03:08:28.440]  100% review, a perfect five star. And like Leanne McAdib, before she went home to take care of her
[03:08:28.440 --> 03:08:33.720]  grandmother and stuff, she's a great reporter for us. She took Ultimate Female Forest and was just
[03:08:33.720 --> 03:08:40.600]  like, this is insane. Stamina, libido, energy. These are amazing things in Ultimate Female Forest.
[03:08:40.600 --> 03:08:44.760]  So I'm glad you plugged it. What's your view, Stacey, from Texas on the Mueller Report?
[03:08:45.480 --> 03:08:50.600]  Well, here's the thing. So I actually like, I used to be considered, I considered myself a Democrat
[03:08:50.600 --> 03:08:56.360]  until the Mueller Report incident came out because I've seen that the Democrats don't want the truth.
[03:08:56.360 --> 03:09:00.920]  They want to set a trap. And that's it. It's not about finding the truth, but all for them.
[03:09:00.920 --> 03:09:07.720]  Well, that's it. And instead of like always, oh, they're in authority and we're not Russian
[03:09:07.720 --> 03:09:12.360]  agents. How about you took money from Uranium One, you took money from the Chycoms, go on the
[03:09:12.360 --> 03:09:17.880]  offense. Trump's got to know he has nothing to lose, man. I'm sick of bowing to these people.
[03:09:18.520 --> 03:09:26.840]  Weirdass Nadler and Schiff and Pelosi and AOC. It's like, I'm going to be ruled by a bunch of retards.
[03:09:26.840 --> 03:09:33.480]  Exactly. You know, it's, it is really crazy because as things come out, as we find out these new
[03:09:33.480 --> 03:09:37.480]  things, they're attaching to the smallest things that they can. They're getting really desperate
[03:09:37.480 --> 03:09:41.160]  and it's really showing a lot of Democrats. And I think that we're going to get a lot more people
[03:09:41.160 --> 03:09:44.120]  coming onto the Republican side because of that, just like it happened for me.
[03:09:45.480 --> 03:09:49.960]  So you were a Democrat and it woke you up. Absolutely. Red-pilled by the Mueller Report.
[03:09:50.520 --> 03:09:54.040]  By the way, I don't blame you. The old blue blood Republican Party was horrible.
[03:09:54.040 --> 03:09:59.800]  I mean, 20 years ago, I didn't know which party I liked. I was a libertarian. But now I mean,
[03:09:59.800 --> 03:10:05.720]  the Democrats are like, how would you describe them? What would you call them? Just a normal person
[03:10:05.720 --> 03:10:11.240]  if you were just from another planet visiting? Okay, I feel like I'm already like another planet
[03:10:11.240 --> 03:10:18.200]  visiting because it is a crazy real great. So, you know, I think, oh God, I forgot the question.
[03:10:18.200 --> 03:10:21.400]  I'm so nervous talking. No, I mean, what would you, well, who are the Democrats? I mean,
[03:10:21.400 --> 03:10:25.000]  Absolutely. Okay. So the Democrats, you know, when I first became a Democrat, I was in high
[03:10:25.000 --> 03:10:30.040]  school. I had to, you know, pick what I wanted to be for, you know, if I wanted to vote when I was
[03:10:30.040 --> 03:10:36.120]  18 years old. So I chose Democrat because I have this idea that I love helping people. I want
[03:10:36.120 --> 03:10:41.160]  there to be social programs, things like that. Exactly. They advertise that they want to help
[03:10:41.160 --> 03:10:46.040]  people. Yes. And so that's why I became Democrat. But, you know, like as I'm seeing, I'm seeing them
[03:10:46.040 --> 03:10:51.160]  a lot more hatred on that side. When I went to college, I went to a university, I started to
[03:10:51.160 --> 03:10:57.560]  see things that I never expected. I just graduated recently. So I saw a lot of, you know, a lot of
[03:10:57.560 --> 03:11:02.280]  victim culture there that I, you know, I don't identify with at all because I came from a background.
[03:11:02.280 --> 03:11:07.000]  My mother is from Mexico. She worked so hard. She came from dirt poor. Now that she,
[03:11:07.000 --> 03:11:10.280]  she's giving me everything, you know, I'm standing on this shoulder, the giant's here.
[03:11:10.280 --> 03:11:14.760]  So I mean, I don't have any sympathy for that. So your mother came here legally and now she's
[03:11:14.760 --> 03:11:19.960]  successful? Yes. She came here legally when she was three years old. She is Republican. She believes
[03:11:19.960 --> 03:11:24.280]  that every Mexican that comes into this country should come here legally because she has worked
[03:11:24.280 --> 03:11:29.240]  so hard and she knows that she had the same opportunities as all of her brothers and sisters
[03:11:29.240 --> 03:11:33.720]  and she's come so far and they, you know, they didn't take advantage of those same opportunities.
[03:11:35.640 --> 03:11:38.440]  Well, God bless your mother. Thank you so much, Taysha. That's beautiful.
[03:11:39.560 --> 03:11:45.560]  That's a beautiful call. Gosh, amazing callers. Let's just try to go to more here. We have an
[03:11:45.560 --> 03:11:50.760]  unlimited phone bank, so it just, I always have to hang up on somebody, but let's go to Debbie
[03:11:50.760 --> 03:11:56.280]  in New Jersey, another lady calling in. Debbie, welcome. Thank you. Hey, Alex. I just wanted to
[03:11:56.280 --> 03:12:01.960]  tell you that we did try to buy the, that new tax book that you have and it was out of stock.
[03:12:02.600 --> 03:12:06.680]  So we're waiting for that. You know, that's my frustration. We buy 500 books and then whatever
[03:12:06.680 --> 03:12:10.200]  is hot sells right out and we never reorder it, but thanks for trying to support us.
[03:12:10.200 --> 03:12:18.520]  Yeah, no, we try to get everything we can, but on the tax subject before I go into anything else is
[03:12:18.520 --> 03:12:24.840]  we are trying to educate people about OIDs and A for Bs and I have done this with the IRS
[03:12:25.480 --> 03:12:32.200]  and they were less than pleased and I own a house. So I'm putting myself out on the line too because
[03:12:32.200 --> 03:12:38.280]  my thing is screw you. That's what we got to do when we're getting over run. What do you make of
[03:12:38.280 --> 03:12:44.520]  Trump and what he needs to do? I mean, the Democrats are doubling down now to come after the country.
[03:12:44.520 --> 03:12:48.040]  We've got to stop this. I mean, I don't want a war. They've started a war.
[03:12:49.080 --> 03:12:54.200]  I've been saying this all along. I'm tired of it. I know a lot of other people are tired of it.
[03:12:55.240 --> 03:13:00.440]  We all have Trump's back. He wants to go to war. Let's go. Let's take care of business.
[03:13:01.080 --> 03:13:05.480]  First thing I tell everybody is everybody with an oath and bond,
[03:13:05.480 --> 03:13:10.920]  lean it. You'll bankrupt them. If he doesn't do that, he's crazy. That's the best way to hit them.
[03:13:10.920 --> 03:13:15.320]  Well, the military is the way law enforcement's away. The average working person is awake of
[03:13:15.320 --> 03:13:19.880]  every race going creed. Trump has double the numbers in Hispanics and blacks and we've got a
[03:13:19.880 --> 03:13:25.320]  rogue government signed on with the chai comms, trying to create a civil war. It's his duty to
[03:13:25.320 --> 03:13:30.680]  stop these people. My question is, what do you do? They're lawless. They're attacking. They're
[03:13:30.680 --> 03:13:35.960]  trying to arrest everybody. What do we do? Tell them, just put the word out there. Get on
[03:13:37.640 --> 03:13:42.680]  TV, radio, whatever he's got to do. We're ready. No, no, I know that. But I mean,
[03:13:44.920 --> 03:13:51.880]  no, I understand. But I mean, coordinating local people doing things is a thing. What do we legally
[03:13:51.880 --> 03:13:56.200]  do when we've got the Democrats trying to overthrow the country? I think the president has to call
[03:13:56.200 --> 03:14:03.080]  them out. And I think he has to get Ranjuri to start indicting them because absolutely. I've
[03:14:03.080 --> 03:14:07.960]  said that from day one to indict them already. What are you waiting for? I appreciate your call.
[03:14:07.960 --> 03:14:12.680]  Thank you so much, Debbie. You know, here's the thing. I'm not in a pissing contest with the
[03:14:12.680 --> 03:14:18.280]  Democrats. I don't want to see them spring in from the end of a rope. They won't stop.
[03:14:18.280 --> 03:14:28.040]  They're allied with the EU, the Chai comms, with Cuba, with Venezuela. They give speeches and say
[03:14:28.040 --> 03:14:36.680]  America sucks. They give speeches and say in people's free speech. Congressman Senator Murphy
[03:14:36.680 --> 03:14:48.280]  says banning Alex Jones is critical to saving America. I've experienced these people and I've
[03:14:48.280 --> 03:14:56.040]  experienced their lives. And at a certain point, man, we got to fight back because our acquiescence
[03:14:56.040 --> 03:15:04.360]  to them has greenlit them funding the Arab Spring to overthrow our allies and put radical
[03:15:04.360 --> 03:15:10.840]  Islam in charge. And then it's in the Soros documents overthrow Israel. And it's not like I'm
[03:15:10.840 --> 03:15:14.120]  in a love fest with Israel. I don't say that apologetically. I'm not against Israel.
[03:15:16.120 --> 03:15:22.040]  Our government wants to overthrow Israel. That'll cause a nuclear war. Israel's not going anywhere.
[03:15:22.680 --> 03:15:29.160]  It's like saying you want a war with Russia. It's not going to happen. It's crazy. You know,
[03:15:29.160 --> 03:15:34.840]  I said I'd play this gym show video. I said I'd do this. I said I'd do this whole vaccine video.
[03:15:34.840 --> 03:15:39.080]  It's so important. But I think more calls are what's needed. And then Papert's taking over.

[03:17:26.200 --> 03:17:31.320]  tried to seize my mother's house. I sued the IRS in one. I beat the IRS then and I've been beating
[03:17:31.320 --> 03:17:35.320]  them ever since. I wrote the book on tax debt settlement and I've helped thousands of people

[03:20:07.400 --> 03:20:13.000]  You found it. The tip of the spear. It is the Alex Jones show.
[03:20:13.000 --> 03:20:20.920]  I hear people talking bad about the way we have to live here in this country.
[03:20:22.920 --> 03:20:29.480]  Harping on wars, we fight and griping about the way things are big. And I don't mind them.
[03:20:30.200 --> 03:20:35.560]  And I don't mind them switching sides and standing up to things. They believe.
[03:20:35.560 --> 03:20:37.720]  And don't pose like you're Americans when you're Democrats.
[03:20:37.720 --> 03:20:44.360]  Why don't you anti-American trash? We've been whipping your ass for a long time.
[03:20:45.000 --> 03:20:50.440]  Get ready to get your ass kicked even worse. Running down a way of life.
[03:20:52.760 --> 03:20:59.880]  I fought and ran, fought and died to keep. If you don't love it, leave it. Crank it up.
[03:20:59.880 --> 03:21:16.040]  I'm coming in tomorrow afternoon. Do the big vaccine announcement. And the other news I haven't
[03:21:16.040 --> 03:21:20.200]  hit. Let's say three o'clock tomorrow. Got a lot of feed. Saturday show.
[03:21:22.120 --> 03:21:27.800]  I hear about some squirrely guy. He don't believe in fighting.
[03:21:27.800 --> 03:21:31.160]  All right. Let's go back to your phone calls right now.
[03:21:32.280 --> 03:21:39.640]  We got John, and we got Chase, and we got Jude, and we got Jacob. Jacob's been holding a long time.
[03:21:40.200 --> 03:21:44.120]  Jacob and Kansas, you're up next. Thank you so much for holding Jacob. You're awesome.
[03:21:45.960 --> 03:21:50.680]  Problem, Alex. Good to be on. Never been on before. Welcome, sir. Thank you for holding.
[03:21:50.680 --> 03:21:56.760]  I just had a couple of things to talk about as far as the mule reply. Really,
[03:21:57.640 --> 03:22:02.520]  I'm thinking more along the lines of it's another one of those democratic fades.
[03:22:04.280 --> 03:22:08.840]  All of the media, everybody's just focusing hard and hard and hard on this.
[03:22:08.840 --> 03:22:11.880]  Even after it's been completely debunked time and time again.
[03:22:11.880 --> 03:22:21.240]  And so I'm feeling more like this is a fallback option every time something new comes out,
[03:22:21.240 --> 03:22:27.000]  like when the Virginia governor came out as an obvious infanticide guy.
[03:22:28.520 --> 03:22:31.720]  No, you're right. We should make it front and center of the North Carolina veto to Bill
[03:22:32.360 --> 03:22:36.280]  saying, don't kill babies after they're born. That was my top story today. I never covered it.
[03:22:36.280 --> 03:22:43.720]  I'll cover it tomorrow in a special report. I promise you're absolutely right. Watching them in
[03:22:43.720 --> 03:22:50.840]  this in this display of evil where they sit there and they get caught doing it and they just reboot
[03:22:50.840 --> 03:22:54.760]  it again and we put up with them like they're the authority figure. What do you think President
[03:22:54.760 --> 03:23:02.600]  Trump should do, Jacob? I put a lot of callers talking about how each almost undermined the
[03:23:02.600 --> 03:23:10.200]  Constitution. They've undermined it. They're a foreign globalist threat. How do you deal with
[03:23:10.200 --> 03:23:15.720]  cancer? That's a hard part though because you got to be in line with the Constitution while
[03:23:15.720 --> 03:23:21.800]  you do it all the way down. Otherwise, the people who on the left and everybody else who
[03:23:21.800 --> 03:23:25.880]  doesn't really know what's going on, they're going to start thinking that all the things that the
[03:23:25.880 --> 03:23:31.720]  media was talking about now it's come true. Well, Trump wiped all these people out, which
[03:23:31.720 --> 03:23:36.600]  he's got leadership to do. And then when they were gone, if he kept it going, I would oppose him.
[03:23:37.240 --> 03:23:42.520]  But we have a foreign globalist power trying to wipe us out. So when somebody's in your face
[03:23:42.520 --> 03:23:49.160]  punching you, you're not martial law to stand up and wipe them out. When you have an infestation
[03:23:49.160 --> 03:23:54.440]  in your government, the response is to remove them. God bless you, Jacob. And they've taken
[03:23:54.440 --> 03:23:59.880]  us there. We're at that point. They want to get me on fair because I'll say that. It's not like
[03:23:59.880 --> 03:24:05.000]  some great thing I want to do just because it's fun for me to do it. These people need to be at
[03:24:05.000 --> 03:24:10.520]  the Nuremberg trial. Bob in Washington, you're on the air. Go ahead, sir. Welcome. Hey, Alex.
[03:24:10.520 --> 03:24:17.480]  Thanks for taking my call. Appreciate it. Thank you. Yeah, I just wanted to respond to your previous
[03:24:17.480 --> 03:24:24.360]  caller, Frank, and how the media in general is trying to get you to compromise to say that you
[03:24:24.360 --> 03:24:30.280]  will tone it back. I saw a podcast that you were on with a young man that had gotten trouble in
[03:24:30.280 --> 03:24:36.200]  Japan. And anyway, his co-host kept on you for maybe about 10, 15 minutes asking you,
[03:24:36.200 --> 03:24:41.480]  just tone it down, just tone it down. And yet you stood firm. And I just wanted to give you some
[03:24:41.480 --> 03:24:48.680]  encouragement to continue to stay firm. Well, yeah, that was Logan Paul. And they just say
[03:24:49.640 --> 03:24:52.600]  once you tone it down once, well, how many times you got to tone it down?
[03:24:52.600 --> 03:25:03.720]  Exactly. You know, the Christians in 64 to 313 AD, all they had to do was do
[03:25:03.720 --> 03:25:11.080]  an act of worship to, you know, to the emperor. To Saturn. Hey, just worship the emperor and,
[03:25:11.080 --> 03:25:18.120]  you know, we won't, you know, we'll let you go. And just... Just worship Jupiter, just worship Saturn.
[03:25:18.120 --> 03:25:24.440]  Exactly. Exactly. So anyway, just wanted to put my two bits in.
[03:25:24.440 --> 03:25:28.120]  And I appreciate you. What do you think Trump needs to do? Because the Democrats have been
[03:25:28.120 --> 03:25:31.960]  caught in a giant fraud and now they're doubling down. I mean, how long we put up with this?
[03:25:33.000 --> 03:25:40.440]  Well, that's a bit above my pay grade. But if Trump, you know, wanted to stop the
[03:25:41.160 --> 03:25:47.080]  influx of all the caravans, he should just freeze the accounts of the people that are,
[03:25:47.080 --> 03:25:51.240]  you know, behind it. Just, you know, he doesn't have to confiscate it or anything. Just
[03:25:51.240 --> 03:25:54.840]  freeze the account and tell them investigation's done. That's it.
[03:25:55.640 --> 03:26:00.920]  Good point. Thank you so much, Bob. Marcos in the great state of Texas. Marcos, thanks for
[03:26:00.920 --> 03:26:04.200]  holding. I really appreciate you joining us on this Friday edition. What's your view?
[03:26:05.320 --> 03:26:09.560]  Hi, Mr. Jones. I appreciate you having me on. First off, I wanted to thank you for bodies.
[03:26:09.560 --> 03:26:14.840]  Been using it for a while, but I sent the bottle to my mom. And after taking it for a few days,
[03:26:14.840 --> 03:26:20.440]  she called me literally in tears, saying that she could see her, the knuckles on her fingers again,
[03:26:20.440 --> 03:26:25.000]  and like the bones and her knees again. She was ecstatic. So personal thank you
[03:26:25.640 --> 03:26:31.080]  to you for that. Because anybody who makes my mom's life a little bit easier has a special
[03:26:31.080 --> 03:26:39.400]  place in my heart. I just throw something in on that. Briefly, turmeric curate in India
[03:26:39.400 --> 03:26:45.800]  is powerful. The average turmeric product is about 3, 5%. Ours is 95%. These strongest
[03:26:45.800 --> 03:26:52.680]  curacuminoid out there. So Advil works great when I got twisted ankle. This is nature's Advil
[03:26:52.680 --> 03:26:57.720]  to the next level. So that's why bodies is so incredible. People should really check it out
[03:26:57.720 --> 03:27:01.000]  and support the infant war. So thank you for giving us your testimony about your mother,
[03:27:01.000 --> 03:27:07.400]  because bodies is amazing. Oh yeah, definitely. I did want to touch a little bit actually about
[03:27:07.400 --> 03:27:13.960]  the Logan Paul podcast that when Caitlyn Bennett was on, I've heard a lot of arguments about how
[03:27:13.960 --> 03:27:19.160]  people say, you know, how are you going to defend yourself if they actually do come and get your
[03:27:19.160 --> 03:27:27.720]  guns one day because our firepower doesn't match the firepower of the would be tyrannical government.
[03:27:27.720 --> 03:27:35.160]  But what my response to that and honestly what might be the answer to a lot of what people
[03:27:35.160 --> 03:27:44.280]  are asking about what can we do is not only having, you know, creating a well-regulated
[03:27:44.280 --> 03:27:50.680]  militia amongst ourselves and our neighbors and our neighborhood, not necessarily a militia ready to
[03:27:50.680 --> 03:28:01.800]  fight or to go into a defensive, exactly, but also a regulated militia of ideas of faith and
[03:28:01.800 --> 03:28:09.160]  oh my gosh, a militia of the mind, an army of the mind. That's a great idea. Exactly and what
[03:28:09.160 --> 03:28:15.160]  I've been trying to do in my neighborhood is, you know, I've been using a next door app. There's
[03:28:15.160 --> 03:28:20.760]  also, you know, those neighborhood apps and buy people over for barbecues. Oh, nothing can stop
[03:28:20.760 --> 03:28:24.840]  you. The sensors can't block you. No one can stop you when you take action in point blank
[03:28:24.840 --> 03:28:30.440]  range. God bless you. I thank you so much. I'm sorry to John, Chase, Jude, Tim. I'm out of time.
[03:28:30.440 --> 03:28:33.960]  I took like 30 calls though. It was a good job with the crew. Tom Pappard. I'm already over
[03:28:33.960 --> 03:28:39.560]  30 minutes. Great TV station manager. Trump got in for a website runner. He is loaded for bear

[03:30:53.880 --> 03:30:56.440]  Frank in North Carolina, thanks for holding so long. Go ahead.
[03:30:56.440 --> 03:31:01.240]  Yeah, I just have to say something, man. It seems like every time I turn on your broadcast,
[03:31:01.240 --> 03:31:05.800]  you're bragging. It just gets old, man. I'm going to shut you down right now, okay?
[03:31:06.440 --> 03:31:11.720]  We're taking calls about your nomination. Do you understand they're having congressional hearings
[03:31:11.720 --> 03:31:17.400]  trying to shut us down? Do you understand I'm ringing the alarm? If that was happening to anybody
[03:31:17.400 --> 03:31:22.040]  else, I'd be freaked out. I mean, what's it going to take? Us being shut down? Is that what you want,
[03:31:22.040 --> 03:31:27.160]  Frank? Yeah, you know what? I'll put it on pause again. Hey, Frank, do you understand it's not
[03:31:27.160 --> 03:31:32.200]  bragging to say we are the tip of the spear, we're under attack, we need your help? As much
[03:31:32.200 --> 03:31:36.840]  begging as I do, we can barely pay the bills and grow in the face of this. I'm not going to just
[03:31:36.840 --> 03:31:41.720]  stop growth and let them start pushing us backwards. You understand? I need your help, Frank. I need
[03:31:41.720 --> 03:31:50.280]  your help, Frank. Go to infowarstore.com right now and help fund the info. Do you understand? I need
[03:31:50.280 --> 03:31:55.560]  your help, Frank. Free press needs your help, Frank. I've been doing a lot of research into
[03:31:55.560 --> 03:32:03.240]  Google and YouTube censorship, and I've noticed that there's one type of video that is the most
[03:32:03.240 --> 03:32:11.560]  censored, the most buried, the most suppressed. And that's the videos where you saw in 2016 election
[03:32:11.560 --> 03:32:17.720]  night all the arrogant, leftist authoritarians like the young turds and others get so butt-hurt
[03:32:17.720 --> 03:32:23.720]  when Trump won. They don't want us to have that victory. They don't want us to remember what political
[03:32:23.720 --> 03:32:29.960]  action did. And that's why the globalist, Hillary and others, are trying to shut in for us now.
[03:32:29.960 --> 03:32:36.040]  This is a fight about taking your speech away, not just my speech, about taking your very sovereignty
[03:32:36.040 --> 03:32:41.480]  away. This country is in a war. So again, I want to thank you for what you've done, but I want to
[03:32:41.480 --> 03:32:45.240]  remind you, if you don't spread the articles and videos, and if you don't financially get the
[03:32:45.240 --> 03:32:50.280]  great products we have and fund us, and the 360 win, we're dead in the water, I'm in your hands,
[03:32:50.280 --> 03:32:59.720]  you're in my hands, infowarstore.com. Thank you. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[03:33:07.640 --> 03:33:09.720]  Ah, Tom Pappett.
[03:33:09.720 --> 03:33:11.640]  Oh.
[03:33:19.560 --> 03:33:24.440]  Welcome back to the fourth hour of the Alex Jones show. I'm not sure. Was that a potbilly
[03:33:24.440 --> 03:33:27.000]  goblin introducing me? I don't know. Well, welcome back to the show.
[03:33:27.000 --> 03:33:31.320]  It's Tom Pappett. He doesn't want to care babies. He's bad.
[03:33:32.120 --> 03:33:37.960]  Is that the blackface baby killer from, who is that? What is that creature on the other end?
[03:33:37.960 --> 03:33:44.760]  North Carolina legalized killing babies after they're born. Liberal Pappett. Liberal.
[03:33:44.760 --> 03:33:50.520]  Don't be racist. Kill babies. That's either Ralph Northam or we have George Soros hacking
[03:33:50.520 --> 03:33:54.280]  in to the infowars mainframe, and I'm hearing it just ethereally.
[03:33:54.280 --> 03:34:01.080]  How dare you not kill babies, Pappett. He wants me to kill babies. How dare you not kill them?
[03:34:01.080 --> 03:34:09.320]  It's liberal. Do I, do I wait until they're born and then if they're viable outside? North Carolina
[03:34:09.320 --> 03:34:16.760]  just vetoed a law to not kill babies after they're born. It's superior. You're in the KKK.
[03:34:16.760 --> 03:34:22.680]  If you don't kill babies, you want to murder babies or you're not the black babies.
[03:34:22.680 --> 03:34:30.840]  Say murder babies, murder babies. Murder babies. This is it. This is the program. Oh, now you're
[03:34:30.840 --> 03:34:37.960]  liberal. Good. Can I resist the NPC programming? This is, it's coming directly into my brain.
[03:34:38.520 --> 03:34:46.440]  We keep them comfortable. We take their organs. A potbelly goblin is confirming to me that it
[03:34:46.440 --> 03:34:52.680]  is a Republican stance to kill babies after they have been born and sell their organs for profits.
[03:34:52.680 --> 03:34:58.520]  This is breaking news here at Info. The Democrats are right. We need to kill the babies.
[03:34:59.640 --> 03:35:06.040]  Kill the babies. It all makes sense now. The blackface KKK baby murderer. He was right all
[03:35:06.040 --> 03:35:13.640]  along. It's so clear. Kill the babies. The governor Northam knows what to do. Sell their organs.
[03:35:13.640 --> 03:35:20.600]  Let him run things. Let Governor Northam become supreme chancellor of Planned Parenthood
[03:35:20.600 --> 03:35:26.440]  and take over the United States. It's all so clear to me now. I love Hillary Clinton. I love
[03:35:26.440 --> 03:35:31.880]  Ralph Northam. Blackface KKK baby murderer should be president. You might want to roll out how this
[03:35:31.880 --> 03:35:37.400]  whole history is actually the KKK and killing babies and he wants to harvest the organs, but
[03:35:37.400 --> 03:35:44.680]  it doesn't matter. We keep them comfortable. Keep them comfortable and discuss it and decide who
[03:35:44.680 --> 03:35:49.000]  wants to do it. But it's true though. Margaret Sanger. Don't want the law involved, the government.
[03:35:50.040 --> 03:35:54.040]  No, no, that would be an infringement. These little loving flesh balls.
[03:35:55.160 --> 03:36:00.760]  We need the government to tell us what to eat, think and do. But when it comes to murdering babies,
[03:36:00.760 --> 03:36:04.120]  you just let the doctor and the woman decide. That makes so much sense.
[03:36:04.120 --> 03:36:08.760]  It makes so much sense. But getting rid of a baby after it's born.
[03:36:09.640 --> 03:36:16.920]  Why? That's a little flesh ball. It's just, it's right in my ear. This is it. The NPC
[03:36:16.920 --> 03:36:24.440]  programming is taking over. Pappert, it's time to kill the baby. It's time to kill the baby. Pappert,
[03:36:24.440 --> 03:36:30.760]  just kill babies. Just kill them all. The devil loves you, Pappert.
[03:36:30.760 --> 03:36:35.720]  The devil will accept me. Just kill babies, Pappert. If we murder the babies.
[03:36:35.720 --> 03:36:44.280]  No, channel five wants to kill them. Oh, it's liberal. Oh, you'll be so cool.
[03:36:45.880 --> 03:36:50.440]  This is it. This is how I can do it. They'll hire me at CNN. All I have to do is kill the babies.
[03:36:50.440 --> 03:36:57.880]  Kill the babies. Kill the babies. Kill the babies. Kill them.
[03:36:57.880 --> 03:37:02.360]  And thanks to Planned Parenthood, I don't even have to be a doctor. Those babies,
[03:37:02.360 --> 03:37:07.160]  those white babies are racist. The white babies are racist, and the black babies,
[03:37:07.160 --> 03:37:13.160]  they'll grow up to be super red. I have the articles here in my stack. North Carolina Governor,
[03:37:13.960 --> 03:37:20.840]  Michelle TV viewers, North Carolina Governor Vito's born live bill.
[03:37:20.840 --> 03:37:28.600]  Bill explicitly directs physicians to provide care for infants who survive abortion.
[03:37:29.240 --> 03:37:35.320]  No, we're going to kill that baby. So long as they're kept comfortable,
[03:37:35.880 --> 03:37:40.200]  you can kill them. Sacrifice them. We keep them comfortable while we get their goodies.
[03:37:41.640 --> 03:37:44.440]  Get all the goodies you sell to the organs. We don't have to pay the babies, Pappert.
[03:37:44.440 --> 03:37:50.600]  We take their goodies, their chitlins. And just think of all the great things
[03:37:50.600 --> 03:37:56.040]  we can do with that money. Let the governor, let the governor have the little,
[03:37:57.240 --> 03:38:06.440]  let them have the baby's chitlins, the gizzards, and the, oh, oh, oh, it's liberal.
[03:38:08.920 --> 03:38:13.080]  This is it. This is how we achieve utopia. I'm hearing it. It's all coming in so clear now.
[03:38:13.080 --> 03:38:19.640]  We kill the babies. Yes. Kill the babies. All you need to do, sign on to killing babies, Pappert.
[03:38:20.360 --> 03:38:25.160]  Kill the babies and worship Satan. Then you could be channel five, could be in New York.
[03:38:25.960 --> 03:38:28.760]  We can move to New York. With Governor Northam. Oh,
[03:38:30.040 --> 03:38:35.080]  oh, Governor Northam is our general manager. You know, we joke about this. This is a real ball
[03:38:35.080 --> 03:38:41.880]  game you take over. It is absolutely insane. Of course, Alex is referencing the Ralph Northam
[03:38:41.880 --> 03:38:46.600]  blackface baby murderer in Virginia, who today or maybe it was yesterday.
[03:38:46.600 --> 03:38:51.320]  But we keep him comfortable. You just got to keep him comfortable. And then it's okay. Do whatever
[03:38:51.320 --> 03:38:54.840]  you want. You sell the orphan. I kid you, I took you to a field. When was that? Like,
[03:38:54.840 --> 03:38:58.920]  maybe give you a heroin shot before I blow your head off. It's like, I kept you comfortable.
[03:38:59.640 --> 03:39:05.320]  As long as you're comfortable. And then it's okay. We want these babies. We sure want the gizzards.
[03:39:07.560 --> 03:39:11.640]  It is just fascinating because, you know, you keep them comfortable and then it's not murder.
[03:39:11.640 --> 03:39:20.280]  Then it's comforts, assisted suicide for organs. We take the blood. We take the skin.
[03:39:22.120 --> 03:39:25.320]  You just sell it. You sell it to the highest bidder. It really does.
[03:39:26.280 --> 03:39:31.720]  It gets the woman's right. We're going to cut this baby. We're going to keep it alive until
[03:39:31.720 --> 03:39:36.120]  the order comes through. But what's wrong with gotten the baby time?
[03:39:36.120 --> 03:39:44.200]  I'm just let us have the organs. They just want the organs. That's all
[03:39:44.200 --> 03:39:49.960]  they want. It's not so bad. Babies don't need organs. They're basically not people until
[03:39:49.960 --> 03:39:58.360]  they're three years old. Exactly. They're racist. That's right. Because if we let white babies grow
[03:39:58.360 --> 03:40:04.120]  up, they might listen to info wars. They might want to be a Trump supporter even just Tom,
[03:40:04.120 --> 03:40:11.720]  we need to take the baby's goodly lookals. You imagine how much money as a governor I made.
[03:40:12.440 --> 03:40:15.560]  The little babies don't know. We keep them comfortable.
[03:40:16.760 --> 03:40:22.120]  All the money. All we have to do. It makes so much sense. To sign all the killing babies, Tom.
[03:40:23.160 --> 03:40:28.920]  You can make a lot of money. Why sell supplements? Why sell amazing products?
[03:40:28.920 --> 03:40:35.160]  Why sell t shirts when you can sell babies? And the best part is you don't ever have to put
[03:40:35.800 --> 03:40:41.080]  baby parts at 50% off. You just sell them wholesale. Exactly. That's why we want to keep
[03:40:41.080 --> 03:40:47.800]  them alive. We don't get top dollar unless we keep them alive. Racists don't want us to kill the
[03:40:47.800 --> 03:41:02.280]  babies, Tom. We have to maximize profits. He's a doctor. He has to be a good man. Now you see,
[03:41:02.280 --> 03:41:11.720]  Tom. It's all so clear. Oh, the NPC programming and makes sense now. I'm going to let you take
[03:41:11.720 --> 03:41:17.720]  over racist. If you want to apologize for not wanting to kill the babies, I'm ready to hear you
[03:41:17.720 --> 03:41:25.080]  apologize. I hereby repudiate my former pro-life stances. Kill the babies. I want to kill the
[03:41:25.080 --> 03:41:32.760]  babies. I want to kill the babies. We have to kill the babies. Oh, liberal. Yeah, kill them.
[03:41:33.400 --> 03:41:37.320]  The future of liberalism. Will you volunteer to join the governor with the scalpel to cut
[03:41:37.320 --> 03:41:44.360]  that babies live out? We get you a little bit of the money. I can get money for killing babies,
[03:41:44.360 --> 03:41:51.160]  too. You can get a lot of money, Tommy. Do we all just come together? The babies are human.
[03:41:52.280 --> 03:42:00.280]  Babies aren't people. Good. Oh, Tom, you're going to be a senator now, not just a governor.
[03:42:00.280 --> 03:42:09.960]  I get to go to the Senate. I get to be a globalist. Just say, kill babies. Here I am.
[03:42:09.960 --> 03:42:16.760]  This is it. I will sacrifice myself on the altar of globalism. Kill the babies. Oh, sell the parts.
[03:42:16.760 --> 03:42:27.560]  Oh, Tom, you're a president now. Tom. Oh, you're so smart. You're so sweet. I love Tom
[03:42:27.560 --> 03:42:35.720]  Pappet. He says, God damn little babies, I think you agree. We're going to do a good job on those
[03:42:35.720 --> 03:42:44.280]  babies because nobody's going to speak up for them, but Governor Northam coming up, Tom Pappet.
[03:42:44.840 --> 03:42:51.160]  Straight ahead, you want to stay with us, stay with us. Don't share the link, though. It's racist.

[03:46:01.720 --> 03:46:06.040]  you cancer cures. I'm not sitting here, you know, selling you late-term abortion and all the great
[03:46:06.040 --> 03:46:10.760]  it is. I just go out and say, what is the top heart pill? What is the top tumor? It's the best
[03:46:10.760 --> 03:46:15.000]  seller because it's anti-inflammatory and what's the best lab in the country? Okay, they're the
[03:46:15.000 --> 03:46:19.880]  highest rated. I'm like, you're only 50% curcuminoid? Well, yeah, they only put $5 product and bottle,
[03:46:19.880 --> 03:46:24.520]  but that's still incredible, sir. I'm like, what's the highest you could do? A month later,
[03:46:24.520 --> 03:46:29.720]  90, 95%. No one's ever done that. I said, how much did that cost for a bottle? It cost $10. No one's
[03:46:29.720 --> 03:46:34.600]  ever done that, sir. The average competitor's three to five percent. The top brand's 50%. I'm like,

[03:46:39.240 --> 03:46:44.680]  is explosive. Our fish oil, I go out and I get the cleanest, the best. My children take it. You think
[03:46:44.680 --> 03:46:49.320]  I'm going to give you fish oil that isn't the very damn best on my soul? You think I'm going to
[03:46:49.320 --> 03:47:05.240]  screw somebody over like one of these devil worshipers? Never in foreshore.com. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[03:47:19.480 --> 03:47:27.080]  Welcome back to the fourth hour of the Alex Jones show. I am Tom Papert. Facebook's got him
[03:47:27.080 --> 03:47:31.720]  for Trump filling in for Alex for these final few minutes of today's episode. There was a potbelly
[03:47:31.720 --> 03:47:37.720]  goblin of some type that was talking to me in the last segment, but I think Infowars got him purged
[03:47:37.720 --> 03:47:43.000]  from the system. I think we're okay now. The NPC programming did not take over. Do not kill babies.
[03:47:43.000 --> 03:47:47.480]  Save the babies. Do not sell their parts. This isn't reverse psychology. It's definitely still
[03:47:47.480 --> 03:47:53.800]  not taking hold. Very important. Do not murder children. Babies included. So Alex, of course,
[03:47:53.800 --> 03:47:59.480]  tomorrow he will be back, it sounds like, at 3 p.m. Central to do an important update on vaccines.
[03:48:00.120 --> 03:48:03.720]  There's some interesting news coming out. I'll leave all that to Alex though. I want to touch
[03:48:03.720 --> 03:48:10.440]  on the Mueller report because callers today have been asked, what should President Trump do?
[03:48:11.080 --> 03:48:16.600]  And I too have that question and I too would love to see something done. But President Trump
[03:48:16.600 --> 03:48:21.800]  did say, or at least his campaign did in a statement yesterday, that it is time to seek
[03:48:21.800 --> 03:48:27.400]  justice and get answers. In other words, it's time to investigate the investigators. The article
[03:48:27.400 --> 03:48:33.960]  is up at bigleaguepolitics.com. Justice will be served. We've been covering this. We've got all
[03:48:33.960 --> 03:48:38.760]  kinds of great, fantastic articles up. We've just got dozens and dozens because unlike
[03:48:38.760 --> 03:48:42.680]  the big box journalists, the corporate journalists, we actually read the report
[03:48:42.680 --> 03:48:49.320]  and we saw what was in it. And it was mind-blowing to see some of what came out in that redacted
[03:48:49.320 --> 03:48:54.280]  version of the Mueller report. So, Kayleigh McKinney, who is a member of President Trump's
[03:48:54.280 --> 03:48:57.720]  campaign, she's one of the higher-ups, she put out a statement yesterday,
[03:48:57.720 --> 03:49:01.640]  signed by the legendary Brad Parscale, President Trump's campaign manager,
[03:49:01.640 --> 03:49:07.880]  saying that it is time to investigate the liars who instigated this sham. They said,
[03:49:07.880 --> 03:49:13.080]  President Trump has been fully and completely exonerated yet again. And it continues,
[03:49:13.080 --> 03:49:19.240]  now the tables have turned and it's time to investigate the liars who instigated the sham
[03:49:19.240 --> 03:49:25.720]  investigation. The statement continued, there is simply no denying that spying did occur
[03:49:25.720 --> 03:49:32.760]  on the Trump campaign in 2016. It goes on, now that collusion and obstruction conspiracy theories
[03:49:32.760 --> 03:49:38.520]  have been exposed for the pathetic hoaxes they always were, the Obama-era Department of Justice
[03:49:38.520 --> 03:49:44.520]  and FBI must answer for their misdeeds and the scam they perpetrated against the American people.
[03:49:44.520 --> 03:49:50.440]  And the statement from the Trump campaign concludes, justice will be served.
[03:49:50.440 --> 03:49:54.840]  So, of course, we're just gonna have to wait and see in the coming days, weeks and months
[03:49:54.840 --> 03:50:00.840]  what that looks like. But now that this is finally behind us, this ridiculous sham,
[03:50:00.840 --> 03:50:06.120]  we've been called Russian bots, we've been called corrupted by the Kremlin, all of these horrible
[03:50:06.120 --> 03:50:12.200]  things, we're just years now, two years longer than that, really. And it's finally over and
[03:50:12.200 --> 03:50:16.600]  behind us. Of course, there are those who refuse to accept reality on the left, just as there always
[03:50:16.600 --> 03:50:20.600]  have been, hey, communism hasn't been tried, you just gotta do it my way and it'll be perfect.
[03:50:21.160 --> 03:50:25.880]  But there's some other stories about the Mueller report that I haven't seen anybody except maybe
[03:50:25.880 --> 03:50:31.720]  Infowars, the cutting edge of journalism, really talk about this type of stuff. Now,
[03:50:31.720 --> 03:50:38.680]  the great fallacy, the great lie is that the Russians just want Trump. They love Trump,
[03:50:38.680 --> 03:50:44.360]  they think he's great, he's amazing. And while that's what I believe, that's not what the Russians
[03:50:44.360 --> 03:50:51.560]  thought whatsoever. Russia was doing anything it could to sow discord, to destroy social cohesion
[03:50:51.560 --> 03:50:58.120]  in the United States of America. And that includes supporting Black Lives Matter. That's right.
[03:50:58.840 --> 03:51:05.240]  Russia had several groups that it created on social media, fake social media pages, called
[03:51:05.240 --> 03:51:12.520]  things like Black Matters, Black Tivists, Don't Shoot US, Black Fist, and a corresponding group
[03:51:12.520 --> 03:51:18.920]  called Black Matters US, all over social media, thousands and thousands of followers pushing
[03:51:18.920 --> 03:51:25.320]  the Black Lives Matter narrative. Why? Because they know that it's nonsensical. What does Black
[03:51:25.320 --> 03:51:32.360]  Lives Matter, what does it do other than result in burning Black cities? And this is a real
[03:51:32.360 --> 03:51:36.200]  point of interest to me that we're never going to see investigated. And of course,
[03:51:36.200 --> 03:51:40.440]  Mueller didn't investigate it because it didn't have to do with the big orange man. As we all know,
[03:51:40.440 --> 03:51:47.000]  orange man bad. One of these groups actually contracted with a self-defense instructor in New
[03:51:47.000 --> 03:51:52.680]  York to offer classes sponsored by the fictional Black Fist group. Again, this is just a Russian
[03:51:52.680 --> 03:51:58.840]  creation. One of these fake Russian social media accounts. They actually paid a defense instructor
[03:51:58.840 --> 03:52:05.240]  in New York to quote, teach African Americans to protect themselves when contacted by law
[03:52:05.240 --> 03:52:10.520]  enforcement. That's all the report has to offer. Personally, I would like to know what were they
[03:52:10.520 --> 03:52:15.800]  being taught? Were they being taught not to do this? Grab for your waistband because that's what
[03:52:15.800 --> 03:52:21.320]  makes police officers think that they're reaching for a weapon. Were they taught to peacefully comply?
[03:52:21.320 --> 03:52:25.240]  Were they taught their rights? Were they taught to get a lawyer? Were they taught about the Fourth
[03:52:25.240 --> 03:52:33.560]  Amendment? Or were they taught how to react with violence? This could be Russia getting people killed
[03:52:33.560 --> 03:52:40.360]  potentially. But because it didn't have to do with President Trump, we will never get to learn.
[03:52:40.360 --> 03:52:45.640]  And it wasn't just Black Lives Matter. They weren't just pushing that narrative. They were also
[03:52:45.640 --> 03:52:56.280]  doing whatever they could to push forward the LGBTQIAA++P agenda with a group titled or a Facebook
[03:52:56.280 --> 03:53:06.120]  page. I believe it was Facebook titled LGBT United. They also were pushing Islam with a group titled
[03:53:06.120 --> 03:53:13.640]  United Muslims of America. All of these were created not because Russia cares about gay people.
[03:53:13.640 --> 03:53:18.520]  They have laws on the books in Russia that basically criminalizes being gay and public.
[03:53:19.080 --> 03:53:24.120]  And it's definitely not because they support Muslims. If that were true,
[03:53:24.120 --> 03:53:28.040]  they wouldn't be pushing them out of the country. Every time there's a terrorist attack in Russia,
[03:53:28.040 --> 03:53:34.600]  they respond immediately and with extreme lethality. So it's not because they support any of these
[03:53:34.600 --> 03:53:38.920]  groups. They don't support Black Lives Matter. They don't have a Black Lives Matter in Russia.
[03:53:38.920 --> 03:53:44.040]  No, it's because they want to sow discord and destroy social cohesion in the United States of
[03:53:44.040 --> 03:53:49.560]  America. And if you look around, what's happened to Alex Jones and Info Wars. Oh, and Shryer just
[03:53:49.560 --> 03:53:54.680]  the other week, he goes out in public and he gets assaulted by a woman or a man. I don't know. They
[03:53:54.680 --> 03:53:59.160]  were wearing a dress. I don't know what they call themselves. You can never tell the pronouns these
[03:53:59.160 --> 03:54:08.600]  days, but not only did they push these groups Black Lives Matter, LGBT and Islam, they pushed
[03:54:08.600 --> 03:54:15.000]  Bernie Sanders. That's right. Comrade Sanders is a Russian plant, apparently. If we apply the same
[03:54:15.000 --> 03:54:20.520]  logic, they apply to Trump. Bernie Sanders, it is revealed, the Mueller report, they supported him.
[03:54:20.520 --> 03:54:24.680]  And of course, you think CNN's going to cover that? I wouldn't hold my breath if I were you.
[03:54:24.680 --> 03:54:30.520]  You just might pass out. So the quote is from the Mueller report, the main idea is this,
[03:54:30.520 --> 03:54:36.840]  use opportunities to criticize Hillary Clinton and the rest, except Sanders and Trump. We
[03:54:36.840 --> 03:54:42.920]  support them. And if you look at it in kind of a Machiavellian, almost even Orwellian sense,
[03:54:42.920 --> 03:54:47.960]  this is the best way to destroy America. You put the guy who was perceived as far right,
[03:54:47.960 --> 03:54:53.080]  and the guy who was perceived as far left, and these far left groups, again, the Black Lives
[03:54:53.080 --> 03:54:59.400]  Matter, LGBTQ and Islam. And you use that because the average American who's somewhere in the middle
[03:54:59.400 --> 03:55:04.040]  that have now been pushed to the right, thanks to the left, it makes us all at each other's
[03:55:04.040 --> 03:55:09.800]  throats. You can't walk out in public in a major city with a Trump hat anymore, or you risk being
[03:55:09.800 --> 03:55:14.840]  harmed physically for your political beliefs. You know, these Russians, they have to be padding
[03:55:14.840 --> 03:55:20.680]  themselves on the back with all this because they did one hell of a great job. I wish we had
[03:55:20.680 --> 03:55:26.360]  government offices that were half as efficient as these Russians. Who knows, we could go beyond
[03:55:26.360 --> 03:55:31.720]  the stars, as Alex Jones says, if the government was as efficient as these Russian hackers.
[03:55:31.720 --> 03:55:38.920]  And of course, the final big one is this all goes back not to June 16, 2015, when President Trump
[03:55:38.920 --> 03:55:45.560]  tossed his hat in the ring. No, it goes back to 2014. They've been doing this since 2014, so it all
[03:55:45.560 --> 03:55:51.560]  makes sense now. Gamergate was nothing but the Russians. Clearly, that's what this must mean.
[03:55:51.560 --> 03:55:57.640]  So all this happened right under Obama's nose. We now pretty much know, not for sure, but everybody
[03:55:57.640 --> 03:56:02.840]  pretty much understands that he must have known about this. He must have allowed it to continue.
[03:56:02.840 --> 03:56:08.040]  He must have known that in 2014, he had people who are essentially Russian spies coming to the
[03:56:08.040 --> 03:56:14.200]  United States under false pretenses on information gathering missions, which they would then use
[03:56:14.200 --> 03:56:19.240]  to create their social media pages. He must have known. And again, President Trump is saying that
[03:56:19.240 --> 03:56:26.840]  the Obama era FBI, the Obama era DOJ, they are going to have to answer questions about this
[03:56:26.840 --> 03:56:32.040]  absolute insanity. So we're starting to wind down here. The Alex Jones show. I want to remind
[03:56:32.040 --> 03:56:36.840]  everybody coming up next is War Room with Owen Shroyer. If you haven't watched that in the past
[03:56:36.840 --> 03:56:41.800]  year, you owe it to yourself because Owen gets better and better and better every day. And I
[03:56:41.800 --> 03:56:48.040]  do want to remind everybody as well, there are some awesome sales right now on infowarstore.com.
[03:56:48.040 --> 03:56:54.840]  I believe when I looked earlier, all t-shirts are 50% off. You can say $50 on the Alexa Pure
[03:56:54.840 --> 03:57:01.000]  Breeze air filtration, which is unbelievable life changer to me. I used to get sick every
[03:57:01.000 --> 03:57:07.000]  winter. Ever since I got my Alexa Pure, I'm fine. Of course, there's also the old standards. I love
[03:57:07.000 --> 03:57:12.680]  this. I love Alpha Power. I love X2. You can get it all at infowarstore.com. And really,
[03:57:13.960 --> 03:57:19.480]  Alex says it enough, but this info war, we're cut off from all of the globalist systems.
[03:57:19.480 --> 03:57:24.360]  Alex Jones is more than anybody else potentially. And so we need the support of individual patriots
[03:57:24.360 --> 03:57:29.800]  like you to make all of this happen, to give poor people like me, who are just coming up in all
[03:57:29.800 --> 03:57:34.120]  this insanity, the opportunity to get his name out there. So again, thank you to Alex Jones.
[03:57:34.120 --> 03:57:38.840]  Thank you to the crew for doing a phenomenal job. I am Tom Hapridge. You can find me on
[03:57:38.840 --> 03:57:43.320]  Facebook on God Emperor Trump. I'll be live again tonight at 8 p.m. Thanks for watching. This is
[03:57:43.320 --> 03:57:48.120]  there. There are thousands of ideologies out there, hundreds of different political systems,
[03:57:48.120 --> 03:57:53.400]  and most of them are funded by the globalist. Info wars is truly the tip of the spear of the
[03:57:53.400 --> 03:57:58.280]  zeitgeist. That's why the globalists are obsessed with it, trying to shut it down. I didn't invent
[03:57:58.280 --> 03:58:03.640]  all this. I went and researched the Renaissance, Americana, and what really works for humanity,
[03:58:03.640 --> 03:58:08.520]  and I'm simply trying to bring it back. And lo and behold, it's super popular like it's always been.
[03:58:09.400 --> 03:58:14.440]  That's why the globalists are trying to shut it down so desperately, because we have the light
[03:58:14.440 --> 03:58:19.480]  in the dark of the night that sends chills at my spine. So whatever you do, continue to support
[03:58:19.480 --> 03:58:24.360]  yourself and Info Wars by buying the great products at infowarstore.com, by spreading the articles,
[03:58:24.360 --> 03:58:28.680]  by spreading the videos, and by praying for this operation, and for praying for this nation
[03:58:28.680 --> 03:58:33.480]  and the world for peace and discernment. For myself and the whole Info Wars family,
[03:58:33.480 --> 03:58:38.840]  I want to thank all of you for what you've done, because without you, Info Wars is nothing.
[03:58:38.840 --> 03:58:41.400]  You are the Info War, and I salute you.
[03:58:45.080 --> 03:58:49.080]  I want to say Brain Force is great. I want to say Turbo Force is amazing. It is.
[03:58:49.080 --> 03:58:55.320]  But if you took it with fish oil, it's like the fish oil is it. The fish oil is better than it,
[03:58:55.320 --> 03:59:01.240]  and that's an example of what I'm talking about. Fish oil is liquid energy, brain, body, heart,
[03:59:01.240 --> 03:59:05.560]  the cleanest, the best out there. You've got the children's, you've got the adults, you've got the
[03:59:05.560 --> 03:59:09.560]  krill oil. If you're going to get the full effect, the fish oil and the children's are really strong.
[03:59:09.560 --> 03:59:13.480]  They don't give you the burpees, but krill oil is the best, and it'll give you the damn burps.
[03:59:13.480 --> 03:59:17.320]  And I'm just sorry. You want something like this, you don't get stuff for free. The krill is
[03:59:17.320 --> 03:59:21.240]  hallucinogenic. It's so good. It might be. I'm not a huge medical statement here, but let me tell
[03:59:21.240 --> 03:59:26.280]  you something. I eat five capitals of krill oil before I go to bed. I'm seeing Santa Claus that night.
[03:59:27.960 --> 03:59:32.600]  So your brain is made basically out of what fish oil is.
[03:59:35.480 --> 03:59:39.480]  So we don't make a big profit off of it, but you notice I just obsess, because whatever the best
[03:59:39.480 --> 03:59:42.360]  is we've got, I just can't lie to you. I just can't do it.
[03:59:42.360 --> 03:59:51.800]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
