[00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:10.661]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:10.661 --> 00:00:12.241]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.241 --> 00:00:13.782]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.782 --> 00:00:17.984]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.984 --> 00:00:22.025]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:30.336 --> 00:00:33.978]  It's the Alex Jones Show live on this Tuesday, October 13th edition.
[00:00:33.978 --> 00:00:37.080]  I'm your host, Paul Joseph Watson, filling in for Alex Jones today.
[00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:38.820]  Huge show lined up.
[00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:44.964]  We've got Anthony Gucciardi at the bottom of the hour talking about self-empowerment and a raft of other issues.
[00:00:44.964 --> 00:00:48.665]  We're also going to take your calls at the beginning of the second hour at 1-800-259-9231.
[00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:56.151]  Bottom of the second hour, this is going to be a really interesting interview for me.
[00:00:56.151 --> 00:01:01.552]  We've got behavioural scientist Gad Saad on to talk about political correctness.
[00:01:01.552 --> 00:01:07.875]  He's recently become intertwined with this fight with social justice warriors, feminist control freaks.
[00:01:07.875 --> 00:01:15.917]  So we're going to get his take from a psychological view on why these people push these narratives, why they're so obsessed with censorship.
[00:01:15.917 --> 00:01:17.618]  That's going to be a key interview.
[00:01:17.618 --> 00:01:19.479]  We may take your calls after that as well.
[00:01:20.379 --> 00:01:27.383]  Alex Jones has filed a special report on ISIS obtaining these brand new Toyotas in the Middle East.
[00:01:27.383 --> 00:01:36.109]  It's apparently, according to the media, a huge mystery as to why they obtained these vehicles as it was, you know, the huge weapons drops that routinely
[00:01:36.909 --> 00:01:43.334]  ...accidentally fall into the hands of ISIS jihadists, so we're going to go to that special report in the second segment.
[00:01:43.334 --> 00:01:44.935]  But first, this.
[00:01:44.935 --> 00:01:48.818]  This is a top story on DruidReport.com right now and InfoWars.
[00:01:48.818 --> 00:01:49.658]  Busted!
[00:01:49.658 --> 00:01:56.103]  CNN uses Jeb Bush staffer planted in audience to frame Donald Trump.
[00:01:56.103 --> 00:01:57.024]  Let's go to that clip.
[00:01:59.249 --> 00:02:02.572]  Donald Trump is always using the C-word about women.
[00:02:02.572 --> 00:02:04.593]  I cherish women.
[00:02:04.593 --> 00:02:05.774]  I cherish women.
[00:02:05.774 --> 00:02:09.697]  I cherish women.
[00:02:09.697 --> 00:02:13.560]  But it wasn't the word a woman used to question Trump.
[00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:14.801]  So, maybe I'm wrong.
[00:02:14.801 --> 00:02:15.742]  Maybe you can prove me wrong.
[00:02:15.742 --> 00:02:17.804]  But I don't think that you're a friend to women.
[00:02:22.984 --> 00:02:24.366]  I knew I shouldn't have picked her.
[00:02:24.366 --> 00:02:27.290]  But the Donald plunged on.
[00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:30.113]  I respect women incredibly.
[00:02:30.113 --> 00:02:36.321]  I have given women more opportunity than I would say virtually anybody in the construction industry.
[00:02:36.321 --> 00:02:38.083]  Trump invoked his wife.
[00:02:38.083 --> 00:02:39.325]  He invoked his daughter.
[00:02:39.325 --> 00:02:40.526]  He invoked his mother.
[00:02:41.267 --> 00:02:43.910]  My mother was one of the great people of the world.
[00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:45.631]  Maybe the greatest ever.
[00:02:45.631 --> 00:02:49.095]  Did mom ever stare at you like this, Donald?
[00:02:49.095 --> 00:02:50.376]  I respect women.
[00:02:50.376 --> 00:02:51.177]  I love women.
[00:02:51.177 --> 00:02:51.997]  I cherish women.
[00:02:51.997 --> 00:02:54.400]  You know, Hillary Clinton said he shouldn't cherish.
[00:02:54.400 --> 00:03:02.728]  Well, if it's all the same to you, Mr. Trump, I'd rather you stop cherishing women and start respecting women.
[00:03:02.728 --> 00:03:03.388]  I do cherish.
[00:03:03.388 --> 00:03:04.109]  I cherish women.
[00:03:04.269 --> 00:03:16.294]  And just when Trump thought it was safe to go on to the next question... If you become president, will a woman make the same as a man, and do I get to choose what I do with my body?
[00:03:16.294 --> 00:03:20.136]  You're gonna make the same if you do as good a job, and I happen to be pro-life.
[00:03:20.136 --> 00:03:25.738]  As for what his questioner did with her body, hands on hips, eyebrow cocked.
[00:03:26.516 --> 00:03:27.518]  Ginnie Mo's CNN.
[00:03:27.518 --> 00:03:28.740]  New York.
[00:03:36.479 --> 00:03:57.269]  Now, of course, what CNN didn't tell you about that clip, about that interruption, about that provocateur during a Donald Trump event, was that this individual, Lauren Batch Elder, who played basically the role of a stooge feminist, I mean, she exhibited all the classical mannerisms of an obnoxious, whining feminist.
[00:03:57.269 --> 00:03:59.371]  She's not an independent individual.
[00:03:59.371 --> 00:04:01.772]  You can see here, Conservative Treehouse has the article,
[00:04:02.452 --> 00:04:04.915]  She's a Jeb Bush staffer, okay?
[00:04:04.915 --> 00:04:09.319]  You may be forgiven for thinking that, you know, Hillary Clinton placed her in that crowd.
[00:04:09.319 --> 00:04:11.942]  She's actually working for Jeb Bush.
[00:04:11.942 --> 00:04:13.003]  She's a plant.
[00:04:13.003 --> 00:04:22.973]  She's a stooge to play the role of an angry feminist, again, to try and tear down Donald Trump on this war on women issue.
[00:04:22.973 --> 00:04:25.315]  And of course, behind the scenes there's a huge move at the moment.
[00:04:26.136 --> 00:04:36.783]  Amongst the establishment GOP Republican candidates, this has come out of Washington whispers and other sources, that they're involved in a coordinated effort to bring down Donald Trump.
[00:04:36.783 --> 00:04:39.565]  And that move is intensifying right now.
[00:04:39.565 --> 00:04:40.806]  This is a part of it.
[00:04:40.806 --> 00:04:42.907]  We're going to get more into this after the break.
[00:04:42.907 --> 00:04:48.011]  Alex Jones special report on ISIS obtaining Toyota trucks, right after the break.
[00:04:48.011 --> 00:04:49.272]  Ton of news coming up.
[00:04:49.272 --> 00:04:49.772]  Stay tuned.
[00:04:49.772 --> 00:04:52.074]  This is the Alex Jones Show live, InfoWars.com.
[00:04:59.787 --> 00:05:07.429]  Just when you thought you've heard it all, parents are pulling their children out of a Bay Area grade school because of a third grader that has been terrorizing fellow students.
[00:05:07.429 --> 00:05:08.229]  That's right.
[00:05:08.229 --> 00:05:17.211]  The unnamed boy who attends Mount Diablo Elementary School has become so violent and out of control, the principal there has had to place the school on lockdown several times.
[00:05:17.211 --> 00:05:24.513]  The third grader in question has thrown rocks at teachers, other students, knocked over garbage cans, punched others in the stomach, and locked himself in bathrooms.
[00:05:24.813 --> 00:05:28.934]  The outbursts have gotten so bad that about 30 parents have pulled their children out of the school.
[00:05:28.934 --> 00:05:32.375]  So far, the school board administration has done nothing to address the situation.
[00:05:32.375 --> 00:05:36.036]  And parents were quoted as saying they want a healthy, safe learning environment for everyone.
[00:05:36.036 --> 00:05:37.196]  Well, I got news for you.
[00:05:37.196 --> 00:05:41.197]  Schools are gun-free zones, which makes them very unsafe.
[00:05:41.197 --> 00:05:46.598]  Back in my day, behavior like this would have gotten you sent to the principal's office to receive three whacks from a paddle.
[00:05:46.598 --> 00:05:48.799]  But I'm sure you won't see that in California.
[00:05:48.799 --> 00:05:50.019]  And just to state the obvious,
[00:05:50.239 --> 00:05:54.832]  We are talking about Mount Diablo Elementary School, so maybe this boy is the spawn of...
[00:05:56.175 --> 00:05:59.697]  Rob Dew reporting for InfoWars.com and InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:05:59.697 --> 00:06:09.824]  Most of the InfoWars radio listening audience is aware of the high-quality, affordable firearms available that are made right here in America at htfirearms.com.

[00:08:17.225 --> 00:08:23.750]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance.
[00:08:23.750 --> 00:08:29.615]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:08:29.615 --> 00:08:41.705]  Alex Jones here for InfoWars.com to break down and reveal the mystery behind why ISIS has hundreds and hundreds and hundreds, perhaps more than a thousand
[00:08:42.845 --> 00:08:50.331]  Late model, armored, militarized Toyota trucks, mainly from the United States.
[00:08:50.331 --> 00:08:52.092]  Now, we reported on this in 2014.
[00:08:52.092 --> 00:08:55.114]  I'm going to show you some of the articles.
[00:08:55.114 --> 00:08:59.037]  The mystery is solved, and it's been solved since the beginning.
[00:08:59.037 --> 00:09:01.279]  But it's hiding in plain view.
[00:09:01.279 --> 00:09:08.324]  And if folks can understand this simplistic report that's factually based, you can understand everything.
[00:09:09.201 --> 00:09:14.065]  The globalists hide everything in plain view like we're idiots.
[00:09:14.065 --> 00:09:21.111]  Al-Nusra, for four plus years, has been funded by NATO, the United States, Turkey, and many others.
[00:09:21.111 --> 00:09:23.854]  It is al-Qaeda in Syria.
[00:09:23.854 --> 00:09:26.416]  That's in Reuters, that's in Associated Press.
[00:09:26.416 --> 00:09:28.798]  They admit that's who the Russians are now targeting.
[00:09:28.798 --> 00:09:29.538]  That is al-Qaeda.
[00:09:30.439 --> 00:09:37.626]  ISIS is another Wahhabi spin-off of that, creating Islamic State in an area between Syria and Iraq.
[00:09:37.626 --> 00:09:40.929]  So that's a separate, new part of the caliphate.
[00:09:40.929 --> 00:09:47.635]  The takeover of Syria and the area around Damascus that's going to be left to Syria is being done by Al-Qaeda al-Nusra.
[00:09:49.249 --> 00:10:03.653]  The US, quote, gives the armored vehicles, the missiles, the weapons, that Saudi Arabia gives them and others give them, to al-Nusra, who are the good rebels, Al-Qaeda, and then they give them to ISIS.
[00:10:03.653 --> 00:10:05.393]  And that's even come out in Congress.
[00:10:05.393 --> 00:10:08.394]  But the mainstream media just keeps acting like this isn't a fact.
[00:10:08.394 --> 00:10:11.055]  The head of Defense Intelligence went public a couple months ago.
[00:10:11.055 --> 00:10:11.875]  We played the clip here.
[00:10:14.139 --> 00:10:17.940]  They've had the deputy head of the CIA go public because they're all covering their butts.
[00:10:17.940 --> 00:10:24.702]  They're either covering their butts or they're signaling to everyone that treason has been committed and something needs to be done.
[00:10:24.702 --> 00:10:29.084]  Our military, remember three years ago, said we're not going to be the Air Force for Al-Qaeda in Syria?
[00:10:29.084 --> 00:10:31.764]  So they changed their name to ISIS to confuse the public?
[00:10:31.764 --> 00:10:43.468]  So last week the Treasury Department comes out and says, we want to know where the trucks came from because they're involved in import-export controls through the Commerce Department.
[00:10:44.528 --> 00:10:48.954]  And so they say, we want to know at the Commerce Department and at the Treasury where the Toyotas came from.
[00:10:48.954 --> 00:10:50.896]  Well, we know a bunch of them came from Texas.
[00:10:50.896 --> 00:10:52.298]  I'm going to show you the articles.
[00:10:52.298 --> 00:10:56.023]  It's been in NPR a year ago.
[00:10:56.023 --> 00:10:57.124]  Even NPR got it right.
[00:10:57.124 --> 00:10:58.786]  It's been in the Spectator.
[00:10:58.786 --> 00:11:00.448]  It's been in InfoWars.
[00:11:00.448 --> 00:11:01.390]  It's been known.
[00:11:02.611 --> 00:11:09.177]  It's been known for a long, long time, just buried in the articles, and then they say, where the hell did they get them?
[00:11:09.177 --> 00:11:14.042]  Are they covering their butts, or are they trying to signal that the public should investigate this?
[00:11:14.042 --> 00:11:16.084]  I think it's a little bit of both, but here are some of the articles.
[00:11:16.084 --> 00:11:24.853]  Here's an article at Washington's blog, up on InfoWars.com today, that breaks it all down, and has the link to The Spectator.
[00:11:26.215 --> 00:11:31.662]  And it also has the link to the public radio.
[00:11:34.187 --> 00:11:40.171]  You can go to Public Radio, PRI International, part of Public Radio, and you can read the article right here.
[00:11:40.171 --> 00:11:46.375]  This one Toyota pickup truck is at the top of the shopping list for the Free Syrian Army and the Taliban.
[00:11:46.375 --> 00:11:46.655]  2014.
[00:11:46.655 --> 00:12:01.625]  And then you go into the article, it admits down here, in the story, that it's come from the United States, given to al-Nusra, and that the State Department, that's Hillary Clinton, gave the non-lethal aid to the Syrian rebels, al-Nusra.
[00:12:01.625 --> 00:12:02.265]  Okay?
[00:12:02.265 --> 00:12:02.466]  Boom.
[00:12:03.326 --> 00:12:05.969]  Now, let's continue.
[00:12:05.969 --> 00:12:12.034]  ISIS drives Texas-made Toyota trucks, apparently modified for U.S.
[00:12:12.034 --> 00:12:13.555]  Special Forces.
[00:12:13.555 --> 00:12:15.597]  And then it gets in how these were made in Texas.
[00:12:15.597 --> 00:12:17.899]  And it links to all the admissions from the U.S.
[00:12:17.899 --> 00:12:19.921]  Army orders, and it's total proof.
[00:12:19.921 --> 00:12:21.603]  Infowars.com.
[00:12:21.603 --> 00:12:22.403]  Here's another one.
[00:12:22.403 --> 00:12:24.025]  Where did ISIS get all those Toyotas?
[00:12:24.025 --> 00:12:27.268]  This is last week, seven days ago, October 7th.
[00:12:27.268 --> 00:12:28.189]  Christian Science Monitor.
[00:12:29.304 --> 00:12:29.464]  U.S.
[00:12:29.464 --> 00:12:35.092]  official asked how ISIS got so many Toyota trucks, ABC News, seven days ago.
[00:12:35.092 --> 00:12:37.335]  So, there's that report.
[00:12:37.335 --> 00:12:41.061]  Then, of course, ISIS got a bunch of, quote, weapons from Iraq, accidentally, that the U.S.
[00:12:41.061 --> 00:12:41.862]  military left for them.
[00:12:44.019 --> 00:12:49.604]  They've got pre-crime systems watching our troops before they commit a crime with computers.
[00:12:49.604 --> 00:12:51.846]  Beyond 1984 or Minority Report.
[00:12:51.846 --> 00:12:56.410]  But the people running the Pentagon and running the White House are arming Al-Qaeda and that's okay.
[00:12:56.410 --> 00:12:57.571]  And it's hidden in plain view.
[00:12:57.571 --> 00:13:01.054]  Where's the current crime monitoring on this?
[00:13:01.054 --> 00:13:03.216]  Let's continue here.
[00:13:03.216 --> 00:13:05.538]  If I try to bring fruit into the country, I'll get arrested.
[00:13:05.538 --> 00:13:06.799]  We're out of the country.
[00:13:06.799 --> 00:13:11.063]  But you can just give Stinger missiles to Al-Qaeda and trucks and nobody gets in trouble.
[00:13:12.153 --> 00:13:12.754]  Here's another one.
[00:13:12.754 --> 00:13:17.922]  Four-wheel drives to Isis what longbows were to the English at their big battle.
[00:13:17.922 --> 00:13:20.787]  And then it goes on, the Welsh longbowmen.
[00:13:20.787 --> 00:13:26.156]  Meanwhile, there's the big speaker fight, and it turns out that Obama is supporting
[00:13:27.085 --> 00:13:29.046]  Of course, Paul Ryan.
[00:13:29.046 --> 00:13:33.467]  We do not need another neocon rhino controller in there.
[00:13:33.467 --> 00:13:38.848]  And we've got Jeb Bush planting staffers in attendance to try to bring down Trump.
[00:13:38.848 --> 00:13:46.370]  And the reason I add these stories to the end of this whole thing about the mystery of the trucks that is no mystery is it just shows how rigged everything is in the establishment.
[00:13:46.370 --> 00:13:52.652]  And if we wake up to the rigging of this and don't act like inept, illiterate morons politically, geopolitically, it's over.
[00:13:53.533 --> 00:14:02.417]  So, there is no mystery to the Toyotas, there is no mystery about Al-Nusra, there is no mystery about Islamic State, ISIS, ISIL.
[00:14:02.417 --> 00:14:04.659]  They play on the public's ignorance to confuse people.
[00:14:04.659 --> 00:14:11.302]  The US military, the CIA, Defense Intelligence, the FBI, everybody knows what's going on here.
[00:14:11.302 --> 00:14:12.783]  And most people don't like it.
[00:14:12.783 --> 00:14:14.483]  To the credit of the government.
[00:14:14.483 --> 00:14:17.285]  And they're saying, American people, stand up, do something.
[00:14:18.450 --> 00:14:20.072]  We need you to speak out.
[00:14:20.072 --> 00:14:21.994]  We need the press to speak out and talk about it.
[00:14:21.994 --> 00:14:26.519]  But ABC News, everybody's like, gee, where'd the trucks come from?
[00:14:26.519 --> 00:14:28.001]  We don't know.
[00:14:28.001 --> 00:14:33.628]  We gave them to the nice rebels out in Israel, and now they're in ISIS's hands.
[00:14:35.017 --> 00:14:38.780]  And clearly some of the trucks came from other places too that Saudi Arabia bought and gave them.
[00:14:38.780 --> 00:14:44.604]  So they're confusing the public that Saudi Arabia bought multi-ship loads from Japan.
[00:14:44.604 --> 00:14:47.666]  So there's different groups, but a bunch of them came from Texas.
[00:14:47.666 --> 00:14:50.208]  And we just gave you all the proof right there.
[00:14:50.208 --> 00:14:51.529]  This is sensational.
[00:14:51.529 --> 00:14:53.571]  And what's old news is new news.
[00:14:53.571 --> 00:14:56.093]  We know this, the general public doesn't know it.
[00:14:56.093 --> 00:15:01.277]  So now someone in the Pentagon, someone in the Treasury Department, they've all been saying this, say, look at where the trucks came from.
[00:15:02.011 --> 00:15:03.571]  Look at where the trucks came from.
[00:15:03.571 --> 00:15:06.552]  We should look at where the trucks came from, because we know where the trucks came from.
[00:15:06.552 --> 00:15:14.053]  All right, I'm going to throw this back over to Paul Joseph Watson, transmitting and broadcasting worldwide, and I'll be back in the saddle, Lord willing, tomorrow, 11 a.m.
[00:15:14.053 --> 00:15:20.714]  Central, right here at the tip of the spear, InfoWars.com, InfoWars Live, and InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:15:20.714 --> 00:15:26.055]  If you're watching this transmission or listening to it, get out there and spread the word, because you are the resistance.
[00:15:26.055 --> 00:15:27.235]  You are the victory.
[00:15:27.235 --> 00:15:28.596]  You are the answer.
[00:15:28.596 --> 00:15:31.196]  Pray to God, lead God, and direct you, and you're unstoppable.
[00:15:33.035 --> 00:15:38.078]  There's Alex Jones with a special report on how ISIS are obtaining all these Toyota trucks.
[00:15:38.078 --> 00:15:42.461]  Again, the media is acting like they're completely ignorant as to where they're coming from.
[00:15:42.461 --> 00:15:56.650]  We know that ISIS has been armed, they've been given equipment by Saudi Arabia, they've stolen it from Iraqi military forces, and in some cases they miraculously discover these US weapons airdrops that they always seem to stumble across.
[00:15:56.650 --> 00:15:58.612]  We've got more news coming on that later, actually.
[00:15:59.452 --> 00:16:05.094]  Shifting back to our top story which Alex mentioned there, basically Donald Trump gave a speech last night.
[00:16:05.094 --> 00:16:10.515]  He was interrupted by somebody posing as a radical feminist.
[00:16:10.515 --> 00:16:18.117]  They had all the mannerisms and basically confronted him on the gender pay gap, on the notion that he hates women.
[00:16:18.117 --> 00:16:24.579]  Turns out, and CNN of course didn't report this in their entire report on this issue that happened last night,
[00:16:25.399 --> 00:16:27.061]  This woman is a plant.
[00:16:27.061 --> 00:16:32.826]  You can see here on the website, Conservative Treehouse, and you can click through to her LinkedIn profile.
[00:16:32.826 --> 00:16:35.869]  She's a staffer for Jeb Bush.
[00:16:35.869 --> 00:16:41.455]  But not only that, she also works for Senator Ayotte, who is pro-life.
[00:16:41.455 --> 00:16:43.917]  And if you go back to that clip, which we're going to play again in a second...
[00:16:44.858 --> 00:16:54.064]  She says, you know, classical feminist talking point, women's rights activist, Hillary Clinton supporter, I have the right to do with my own body what I want to do.
[00:16:54.064 --> 00:16:58.167]  And yet she's working for somebody who is pro-life, a Republican senator.
[00:16:58.167 --> 00:17:00.128]  She's working for Jeb Bush.
[00:17:00.128 --> 00:17:02.550]  This is a staged provocation.
[00:17:02.550 --> 00:17:07.413]  CNN has absolutely nothing to say about the fact that it is contrived.
[00:17:07.413 --> 00:17:08.634]  Let's go back to that clip.
[00:17:08.634 --> 00:17:10.575]  Let's play just a minute of that clip right now.
[00:17:10.575 --> 00:17:11.116]  Here's CNN.
[00:17:12.677 --> 00:17:16.419]  Donald Trump is always using the C-word about women.
[00:17:16.419 --> 00:17:18.019]  I cherish women.
[00:17:18.019 --> 00:17:19.200]  I cherish women.
[00:17:19.200 --> 00:17:23.122]  I cherish women.
[00:17:23.122 --> 00:17:26.983]  But it wasn't the word a woman used to question Trump.
[00:17:26.983 --> 00:17:28.224]  So, maybe I'm wrong.
[00:17:28.224 --> 00:17:29.164]  Maybe you can prove me wrong.
[00:17:29.164 --> 00:17:31.225]  But I don't think that you're a friend to women.
[00:17:36.414 --> 00:17:37.815]  I knew I shouldn't have picked her.
[00:17:37.815 --> 00:17:40.718]  But the Donald plunged on.
[00:17:40.718 --> 00:17:43.541]  I respect women incredibly.
[00:17:43.541 --> 00:17:49.767]  I have given women more opportunity than I would say virtually anybody in the construction industry.
[00:17:49.767 --> 00:17:51.528]  Trump invoked his wife.
[00:17:51.528 --> 00:17:52.810]  He invoked his daughter.
[00:17:52.810 --> 00:17:53.951]  He invoked his mother.
[00:17:54.711 --> 00:17:57.332]  My mother was one of the great people of the world.
[00:17:57.332 --> 00:17:59.052]  Maybe the greatest ever.
[00:17:59.052 --> 00:18:02.513]  Did mom ever stare at you like this, Donald?
[00:18:02.513 --> 00:18:03.793]  I respect women.
[00:18:03.793 --> 00:18:04.614]  I love women.
[00:18:04.614 --> 00:18:05.414]  I cherish women.
[00:18:05.414 --> 00:18:07.814]  You know, Hillary Clinton said she shouldn't cherish.
[00:18:07.814 --> 00:18:16.157]  Well, if it's all the same to you, Mr. Trump, I'd rather you stop cherishing women and start respecting women.
[00:18:16.157 --> 00:18:16.797]  I do cherish.
[00:18:16.797 --> 00:18:17.537]  I cherish women.
[00:18:17.697 --> 00:18:29.743]  And just when Trump thought it was safe to go on to the next question... If you become president, will a woman make the same as a man, and do I get to choose what I do with my body?
[00:18:29.743 --> 00:18:33.565]  You're gonna make the same if you do as good a job, and I happen to be pro-life.
[00:18:33.565 --> 00:18:39.168]  As for what his questioner did with her body, hands on hips, eyebrow cocked.
[00:18:39.946 --> 00:18:40.907]  Ginnie Moe, CNN!
[00:19:10.767 --> 00:19:14.990]  Which is, you know, like the college rape scandal, a complete myth.
[00:19:16.055 --> 00:19:21.940]  That's the difference between the average earnings of men and women who work full-time.
[00:19:21.940 --> 00:19:29.547]  It doesn't account for the differences in occupations, positions, educations and, crucially, hours worked per week.
[00:19:29.547 --> 00:19:33.310]  So that statistic has been debunked over and over again.
[00:19:33.310 --> 00:19:38.634]  Yet CNN, through this contrived stage provocation, is pushing it.
[00:19:38.634 --> 00:19:40.896]  We're going to get more into that after the break.
[00:19:40.896 --> 00:19:42.337]  Also Alex Jones calling in.
[00:19:43.258 --> 00:19:45.120]  Again, Gadsad coming up.
[00:19:45.120 --> 00:19:46.801]  Bottom of the second hour, your calls.
[00:19:46.801 --> 00:19:48.903]  This is the Alex Jones Show live.
[00:19:48.903 --> 00:19:51.284]  BreakingNewsInfoWars.com.
[00:19:51.284 --> 00:19:51.845]  Stay tuned.
[00:20:00.066 --> 00:20:04.491]  Most of us already know that taking a fish oil supplement to boost omega-3s is a good idea.
[00:20:04.491 --> 00:20:08.556]  But did you know that about 60% of Americans are actually deficient in omega-3s?
[00:20:08.556 --> 00:20:12.781]  Did you know that most fish oil products contain only about 25% omega-3s and the remaining 75% is undesirable fish fat?
[00:20:15.925 --> 00:20:21.148]  Heck, did you know that more than 90% of fish oil supplements sold in the USA are not even made here?
[00:20:21.148 --> 00:20:29.852]  If you want to boost your Omega-3s using the finest American-made fish oil, check out Nutrigold fish oil supplements on www.fishoil.best.

[00:21:30.850 --> 00:21:32.631]  Do you owe the IRS money you can't pay?
[00:21:32.631 --> 00:21:34.293]  Are tax debts crippling you?
[00:21:34.293 --> 00:21:37.095]  I've defended people from the IRS for over 30 years.
[00:21:37.095 --> 00:21:39.397]  I've helped thousands and I can help you too.
[00:21:39.397 --> 00:21:43.901]  I wrote the book on IRS settlement and I'm telling you there's no such thing as a hopeless case.
[00:21:43.901 --> 00:21:47.864]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX to finally get free of IRS debt.
[00:21:47.864 --> 00:21:51.627]  With the IRS's new programs, there's never been a better time to solve your problem.
[00:21:51.627 --> 00:21:51.948]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX.
[00:21:51.948 --> 00:21:53.689]  That's 800-34-NO-TAX or my website, danpilla.com.
[00:21:59.181 --> 00:22:05.902]  My name is Bill Bonner, and I'm the president of the largest private news and research network in the world.
[00:22:05.902 --> 00:22:11.383]  And I paid for this airtime because I have an important message to the American people.
[00:22:11.383 --> 00:22:15.924]  There's a change coming that the government isn't telling you about.
[00:22:15.924 --> 00:22:20.205]  This change has deep implications for life in America.
[00:22:20.205 --> 00:22:24.446]  From where you shop, to the doctors you visit, and the family you want to protect.
[00:22:25.046 --> 00:22:28.167]  Look, I've made predictions like this before.
[00:22:28.167 --> 00:22:31.128]  Thing is, I was right then, too.
[00:22:31.128 --> 00:22:35.529]  A few years ago, I warned that housing prices would collapse.
[00:22:35.529 --> 00:22:36.629]  They did.
[00:22:36.629 --> 00:22:41.690]  Before that, I warned that dot-com companies would crash.
[00:22:41.690 --> 00:22:42.851]  They did.
[00:22:42.851 --> 00:22:46.692]  Those who listened had a chance to save themselves.
[00:22:46.692 --> 00:22:49.052]  But this has nothing to do with the stock market.
[00:22:49.052 --> 00:22:50.573]  This will affect us all.
[00:22:50.573 --> 00:22:51.893]  You can watch the video for free

[00:23:25.971 --> 00:23:28.193]  There is only one silver solution.
[00:23:28.613 --> 00:23:29.474]  We're good to go!
[00:24:26.667 --> 00:24:27.448]  We're back live.
[00:24:27.448 --> 00:24:28.349]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[00:24:28.349 --> 00:24:31.091]  We're going to be joined live by Alex in a moment.
[00:24:31.091 --> 00:24:39.638]  But again, you know, whether you like Donald Trump or not, and I made a video attacking him a couple of months ago on his flip-flopping, he's a maverick.
[00:24:39.638 --> 00:24:41.079]  He's unpredictable.
[00:24:41.079 --> 00:24:49.726]  And if there's one thing that control freaks hate, it's unpredictability, which is now why behind the scenes there's this move amongst these GOP establishment candidates
[00:24:50.467 --> 00:24:57.894]  To coordinate in a concerted effort to sink Donald Trump by these staged incidents which we saw last night.
[00:24:57.894 --> 00:25:01.597]  With CNN carrying the water for this narrative again.
[00:25:01.597 --> 00:25:03.619]  Notice in the clip we played just before the break.
[00:25:05.188 --> 00:25:06.329]  The narrative again.
[00:25:06.329 --> 00:25:08.690]  Did mom ever stare at you like this?
[00:25:08.690 --> 00:25:10.891]  They act as if this is a real incident.
[00:25:10.891 --> 00:25:12.411]  This woman is an actor.
[00:25:12.411 --> 00:25:13.712]  She's a stooge.
[00:25:13.712 --> 00:25:22.336]  So we have CNN amplifying this contrived Twitter outrage culture, which attempts to publicly shame people into apologizing.
[00:25:22.336 --> 00:25:24.157]  It's a complete paper tiger.
[00:25:24.157 --> 00:25:29.399]  It never works if you stand up to these authoritarians and basically say, no, I'm going to say what's on my mind.
[00:25:29.399 --> 00:25:30.640]  I'm going to say what I think.
[00:25:30.640 --> 00:25:32.021]  I'm not going to be intimidated.
[00:25:32.961 --> 00:25:34.142]  By your propaganda.
[00:25:34.142 --> 00:25:37.803]  And CNN is carrying that narrative without telling you.
[00:25:37.803 --> 00:25:43.386]  It's very easy to go to her LinkedIn profile and see she's working for Jeb Bush.
[00:25:43.386 --> 00:25:44.727]  She's also working for another...
[00:25:45.720 --> 00:25:50.584]  Republican senator who is pro-life while claiming that she's pro-abortion.
[00:25:50.584 --> 00:25:57.489]  So from beginning to end, a staged incident, CNN carries the propaganda dutifully.
[00:25:57.489 --> 00:25:58.710]  Alex Jones is on the line.
[00:25:58.710 --> 00:26:00.631]  Alex, go ahead.
[00:26:00.631 --> 00:26:01.952]  Absolutely, Paul.
[00:26:01.952 --> 00:26:05.615]  Calling you via cell phone from the road, taking care of key business.
[00:26:05.615 --> 00:26:06.976]  Do you read me clearly?
[00:26:06.976 --> 00:26:08.417]  Yeah, you're coming through loud and clear, Alex.
[00:26:09.343 --> 00:26:10.143]  Fantastic, Paul.
[00:26:10.143 --> 00:26:11.604]  I'm not going to be here long.
[00:26:11.604 --> 00:26:16.125]  I'm going to be filing more reports later in the broadcast today, and of course back tomorrow, but exactly.
[00:26:16.125 --> 00:26:26.228]  It's this theme of absolutely everything being as staged as a $3 bill, and you have the public worldwide waking up to this.
[00:26:26.228 --> 00:26:34.731]  That's why somebody like Donald Trump is so popular, is because if the establishment attacks someone, well then everybody buys into them, whether they're good or not.
[00:26:34.731 --> 00:26:37.752]  It shows this system is a house of cards.
[00:26:38.465 --> 00:26:44.167]  And is a total fraud, but there's an article that you could cover today that I'm going to be covering tomorrow.
[00:26:44.167 --> 00:26:52.030]  It's out of the Atlantic Monthly, the most establishment Democrat elitist publication there probably is.
[00:26:52.030 --> 00:26:55.232]  And the headline is, The Coddling of the American Mind.
[00:26:55.232 --> 00:27:06.256]  And it says the left is mentally ill, and that the schools have been taken over by people removing words, and that it's a cult of mentally ill people.
[00:27:06.707 --> 00:27:17.490]  That have basically agoraphobia, or a fear complex, a panic attack by any information, any words, any language.
[00:27:17.490 --> 00:27:28.493]  But what's incredible is, this is the leftist social engineers telling older leftists that are upset and scared, everything's okay, it's just mental illness.
[00:27:28.493 --> 00:27:35.315]  And they actually say, most of the young people are now mentally ill, we need to screen the college students
[00:27:35.811 --> 00:27:37.672]  And list them all as mentally ill.
[00:27:37.672 --> 00:27:53.061]  So they made their leftist children and young adults mentally ill, gibbering morons, and then they come in and report on how horrible it is and how they're going to teach them the proper political correctness.
[00:27:53.061 --> 00:27:57.083]  The same thing Obama did a month ago at a college campus.
[00:27:57.083 --> 00:28:00.685]  So this used the incredible level
[00:28:01.579 --> 00:28:01.919]  I think so.
[00:28:20.174 --> 00:28:27.778]  Good government can help a free market, but no, big government is de-industrializing the world under Agenda 21.
[00:28:27.778 --> 00:28:30.960]  Innovation and free market makes prosperity.
[00:28:30.960 --> 00:28:34.322]  Third world hell is created by big central government.
[00:28:35.171 --> 00:28:38.272]  He's pushing for it, but they have a 9% approval rating.
[00:28:38.272 --> 00:28:40.933]  They're begging us to buy back into their con game.
[00:28:40.933 --> 00:28:43.755]  Their confidence has totally collapsed with the public.
[00:28:43.755 --> 00:28:50.317]  That's why they're crippling down, saying, please trust us, and trying to intimidate us, because we are unpredictable.
[00:28:50.317 --> 00:28:51.158]  We're awake.
[00:28:51.158 --> 00:28:52.038]  We're free.
[00:28:52.038 --> 00:28:53.119]  We're dynamic.
[00:28:53.119 --> 00:28:59.321]  And if we realize that this is the big battle, they're pushing with their counteroffensive, because we're winning.
[00:28:59.321 --> 00:29:01.402]  Paul Watson, you're doing an incredible job.
[00:29:01.402 --> 00:29:03.463]  I'm sure if we could get you to move to the States and
[00:29:04.023 --> 00:29:05.544]  Be in studio with us every day.
[00:29:05.544 --> 00:29:10.267]  I know you're going back to England in a few weeks, a week and a half, but great job, Paul Watson.
[00:29:10.267 --> 00:29:11.147]  You're going to be in D.C.
[00:29:11.147 --> 00:29:16.090]  this weekend reporting on the Sunday Show with me as well on some big breaking news.
[00:29:16.090 --> 00:29:17.871]  But I just want to salute the audience.
[00:29:17.871 --> 00:29:20.412]  I just want to salute everybody that stands for freedom.
[00:29:20.412 --> 00:29:25.275]  I want to salute Matt Grudge visiting us last Tuesday at this time and our incredible crew.
[00:29:25.275 --> 00:29:26.435]  We are on the march.
[00:29:26.435 --> 00:29:28.877]  The Empire is on the run.
[00:29:28.877 --> 00:29:30.258]  Paul Watson, great job.
[00:29:30.258 --> 00:29:30.798]  God bless you.
[00:29:31.388 --> 00:29:33.690]  Okay, there goes Alex Jones after the break.
[00:29:33.690 --> 00:29:35.711]  We've got Anthony Gucciardi coming up.
[00:29:35.711 --> 00:29:42.996]  We're also going to talk to Gad Saad, who is a behavioural psychologist, again about political correctness, about what Alex was just talking about.
[00:29:42.996 --> 00:29:44.276]  Your call's coming soon.
[00:29:44.276 --> 00:29:47.258]  This is the Alex Jones Show Live, InfoWars.com.
[00:29:47.258 --> 00:29:49.040]  Stay right there.
[00:29:49.040 --> 00:29:50.440]  We're on the march.
[00:29:50.440 --> 00:29:52.982]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:52.982 --> 00:29:55.644]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:00.484 --> 00:30:01.725]  Who do you prefer?
[00:30:01.725 --> 00:30:05.308]  Barack Obama or George W. Bush?
[00:30:05.308 --> 00:30:10.272]  Well, if you haven't figured it out by now, these guys are corporate spokesmen.
[00:30:10.272 --> 00:30:11.333]  They're not leaders.
[00:30:11.333 --> 00:30:13.975]  I mean, they both started illegal wars.
[00:30:13.975 --> 00:30:15.817]  Hell, they both tortured people.
[00:30:15.817 --> 00:30:19.600]  They bailed out criminal corporations and they spied on you.
[00:30:19.600 --> 00:30:23.944]  They both violated the Constitution and they even committed war crimes.
[00:30:24.304 --> 00:30:25.465]  So what's it gonna take?
[00:30:25.465 --> 00:30:28.207]  I mean, what will it take to finally wake you up?
[00:30:28.207 --> 00:30:29.027]  Think about it.
[00:30:29.027 --> 00:30:38.294]  If Joseph Stalin ran for president as a Democrat and Adolf Hitler ran as a Republican, one of them would end up leading our country.
[00:30:38.294 --> 00:30:40.476]  It's politics incorporated.
[00:30:40.476 --> 00:30:44.058]  And your choice between the two parties is a myth.
[00:30:44.058 --> 00:30:48.942]  Because in reality, it is a two-party tyranny with one ideology.
[00:30:48.942 --> 00:30:50.423]  Divide and conquer.
[00:30:50.683 --> 00:30:55.655]  So join the revolution and break the false left versus right paradigm.
[00:30:55.655 --> 00:30:57.019]  InfoWars.com

[00:31:32.975 --> 00:31:37.956]  You've probably noticed I've been more focused, less brain fog, more energy, and it's because of BrainForce.
[00:31:37.956 --> 00:31:41.237]  There's always hidden additives in your food, even organic food has hidden additives.
[00:31:41.237 --> 00:31:44.718]  Staring at the computer all day, working, doing good, you're still damaging your brain.
[00:31:44.718 --> 00:31:46.698]  Ultimately, we've all been dumbed down to some degree.
[00:31:46.698 --> 00:31:48.779]  It doesn't have stimulants, it doesn't have garbage in it.
[00:31:48.779 --> 00:31:50.819]  It has natural things that do it clean.

[00:33:15.068 --> 00:33:23.976]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:33:23.976 --> 00:33:24.957]  We're back live.
[00:33:24.957 --> 00:33:26.138]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:26.138 --> 00:33:28.060]  I'm joined now by Anthony Gucciardi.
[00:33:28.060 --> 00:33:30.982]  We're going to be taking your calls in the second hour.
[00:33:30.982 --> 00:33:31.183]  It's 1-800-259-9231.
[00:33:34.184 --> 00:33:45.613]  Now we've been discussing over the past few days, and we've made some videos about this actually on Facebook and YouTube, a couple of which are going to be uploaded over the next few days, basically
[00:33:46.641 --> 00:34:09.223]  The culture the society has made being dumb trendy once again, being intellectually sophisticated, having conviction and being informed is being treated as some kind of social pariah issue where you're, you know, isolated from your peers because you're knowledgeable on certain issues that actually are of importance.
[00:34:10.373 --> 00:34:21.402]  And that's something that we've covered on Facebook, on YouTube, so we're going to delve into that because we went to ACL and sampled, you know, just the general atmosphere of what resonates with young people.
[00:34:21.402 --> 00:34:31.130]  Obviously they're out there having fun, they're not going to some kind of conference or meeting where they're going to discuss important issues, but just hearing their conversations gives you a key insight
[00:34:31.750 --> 00:34:31.790]  In
[00:34:49.935 --> 00:35:02.565]  You know, quite energetic, informed young people who were interested in what we were saying, who weren't petrified of the fact that we could form actual sentences and that we weren't afraid of talking in public in front of other people.
[00:35:02.565 --> 00:35:09.290]  You know, which was positive because the previous night we went to ACL and maybe we came away with a different impression, so...
[00:35:10.373 --> 00:35:19.356]  Just get into what we saw at ACL and how do we make, you know, being informed, being knowledgeable, having conviction, how do we make that cool and trendy again?
[00:35:19.356 --> 00:35:27.259]  How do we make that part of the zeitgeist where young people want to embrace that as something, you know, cool and trendy that they can share with their friends?
[00:35:27.699 --> 00:35:43.645]  You know, there are definitely smart people out there, but I think what we're seeing, unfortunately, is the collapse of free thinking and the collapse of society on a fundamental level, where just being able to speak and having charisma and being able to communicate is looked at like you're some type of space alien.
[00:35:43.645 --> 00:35:46.666]  And you're talking about ACL Music Festival, which we went to for, like,
[00:35:47.566 --> 00:35:51.007]  Twenty minutes, pretty much.
[00:35:51.007 --> 00:35:53.788]  Basically, we went there, and I get that people want to have fun.
[00:35:53.788 --> 00:35:54.548]  That's totally fine.
[00:35:54.548 --> 00:35:58.349]  We all do silly things to relax sometimes, watch stupid television shows sometimes.
[00:35:58.349 --> 00:35:59.169]  We all do it, right?
[00:35:59.169 --> 00:36:00.109]  No big deal.
[00:36:00.109 --> 00:36:09.732]  But I mean, the insanity of when we see hundreds of people walking the wrong way, thinking they're going to the show, but they're literally going the wrong way, and I say, hey, do you guys know where you're going?
[00:36:10.632 --> 00:36:11.573]  Stop talking to me!
[00:36:11.573 --> 00:36:12.954]  They look at me like I'm insane.
[00:36:12.954 --> 00:36:15.756]  Like, how dare that person communicate with me?
[00:36:15.756 --> 00:36:18.298]  Another human being talking to a stranger.
[00:36:18.298 --> 00:36:19.299]  Oh my gosh!
[00:36:19.299 --> 00:36:21.800]  Like, how could a human being speak to me right now?
[00:36:21.800 --> 00:36:27.685]  Or, when we ask them, you know, we're filming a video in front of a bunch of people, which, oh, it blows their mind.
[00:36:27.685 --> 00:36:30.147]  How could they have the charisma to film a video?
[00:36:30.147 --> 00:36:31.027]  Well, because we're passionate.
[00:36:31.027 --> 00:36:31.828]  We care about stuff.
[00:36:31.828 --> 00:36:34.190]  We're filming a video, and we actually ask them something.
[00:36:34.190 --> 00:36:35.551]  Well, what do you think about this issue?
[00:36:35.551 --> 00:36:36.832]  And they just, like, stare at us like,
[00:36:37.492 --> 00:36:38.453]  What?
[00:36:38.453 --> 00:36:42.596]  Like, they have never communicated before like that.
[00:36:42.596 --> 00:36:48.299]  We should have went up and been like, hey, you know, man, this, you know, this upcoming football game, you know, they just can't.
[00:36:48.299 --> 00:36:54.384]  Some of these people, unfortunately, some people, unfortunately, just cannot grasp that level of communication.
[00:36:54.384 --> 00:36:56.225]  And we're bad for even talking to them.
[00:36:56.225 --> 00:36:56.425]  Yeah.
[00:36:56.425 --> 00:36:57.306]  We're bad for caring.
[00:36:57.306 --> 00:36:58.206]  We're bad for having passion.
[00:36:58.206 --> 00:37:01.668]  It's like idiocracy when they would make fun of people for using big words.
[00:37:02.609 --> 00:37:09.077]  It's almost like basic levels of human compassion, empathy, basic levels of human intelligence are made fun of.
[00:37:09.077 --> 00:37:18.327]  And if you exemplify them in any fashion, like we did a live stream at this park, and we were talking to some random people that actually got it, and they were really energized and like, wow!
[00:37:18.968 --> 00:37:30.416]  Finding someone with passion that cares about people is really cool and they just watched us while we kind of did it, but people walking by were just so freaked out that we're shooting videos in a public spot talking about important things that matter.
[00:37:30.416 --> 00:37:30.936]  Yeah.
[00:37:30.936 --> 00:37:36.460]  I mean, you did a video on Facebook with a perfect title that pretty much summarized all of it.
[00:37:37.661 --> 00:37:39.223]  Maybe not repeatable on air.
[00:37:39.223 --> 00:37:40.243]  Absolutely.
[00:37:40.243 --> 00:37:42.285]  Yeah, I think there's a kind of fissure.
[00:37:42.285 --> 00:37:54.295]  I mean, I don't want to get too negative about it, but basically it's splitting both ways where some people are becoming more dumb, they're tuning out to a greater degree, but some people are resonating more, you know, with a higher message.
[00:37:54.295 --> 00:37:57.638]  I think that's what's going on, and the people in the middle are just becoming irrelevant.
[00:37:57.638 --> 00:37:59.279]  There's actually a study you talked about
[00:38:00.160 --> 00:38:02.443]  You know, we were walking out from ACL.
[00:38:02.443 --> 00:38:04.747]  We were trying to find an Uber.
[00:38:04.747 --> 00:38:09.373]  Asking people, you know, what they were doing, what they were looking for, what direction they were going in and why.
[00:38:09.373 --> 00:38:12.858]  One girl basically just said, I don't know where I'm going.
[00:38:12.858 --> 00:38:14.741]  She was literally following the herd.
[00:38:15.442 --> 00:38:17.324]  So again... She didn't even know what she was doing!
[00:38:17.324 --> 00:38:18.225]  Didn't even know!
[00:38:18.225 --> 00:38:19.466]  Didn't even have a clue.
[00:38:19.466 --> 00:38:22.189]  At least she talked to us without being completely terrified, I guess.
[00:38:22.189 --> 00:38:22.429]  That's true.
[00:38:22.429 --> 00:38:24.030]  So she got past that stage.
[00:38:24.030 --> 00:38:28.955]  But there's this social conformity experiment, which I'm going to talk about with my next guest.
[00:38:28.955 --> 00:38:35.441]  And if you Google Solomon Asch conformity experiment Wikipedia, it will come up.
[00:38:35.441 --> 00:38:37.643]  And basically this ties into what we were saying, because
[00:38:38.544 --> 00:38:41.045]  They had an experiment with eight participants.
[00:38:41.045 --> 00:38:41.485]  There it is.
[00:38:41.485 --> 00:38:44.906]  And if you scroll down, there's an image on the right-hand side with three lines there.
[00:38:44.906 --> 00:38:46.006]  Yeah, right there.
[00:38:46.006 --> 00:38:48.347]  So they got eight participants.
[00:38:48.347 --> 00:38:49.928]  Seven of them were stooges, right?
[00:38:49.928 --> 00:38:53.089]  So there was only one real participant in the experiment.
[00:38:53.089 --> 00:39:00.891]  All they had to do was say out loud which length the line on the left matched on the line on the right.
[00:39:00.891 --> 00:39:04.352]  So you've got three vertical lines, A, B, C, if you just go back to that.
[00:39:04.352 --> 00:39:05.673]  So it's obviously C, right?
[00:39:06.793 --> 00:39:11.077]  So they got seven participants in this experiment who are stooges.
[00:39:11.077 --> 00:39:13.799]  They all say an incorrect answer.
[00:39:13.799 --> 00:39:21.465]  So they say that the line on the left is equivalent the same length as the line B, for example, which is obviously wrong.
[00:39:21.465 --> 00:39:26.069]  But they're stooges, they're knowledgeable about the agenda behind this experiment.
[00:39:26.069 --> 00:39:30.252]  Then the eighth participant, who is completely independent, doesn't know what's going on,
[00:39:31.326 --> 00:39:46.467]  In 40% of the cases, we'll mimic the answer of the previous 7 participants in that experiment, even though it's blatantly obvious that that is the incorrect answer, simply because they want to conform to peer pressure.
[00:39:48.108 --> 00:39:48.709]  40%!
[00:39:48.709 --> 00:39:53.870]  And if the Stooges said the right answer, the margin of error was only 1%.
[00:39:53.870 --> 00:40:08.655]  So again, proving that they will follow the herd, even if it's blatantly wrong, even if they're saying something completely ridiculous, they're more comfortable to follow the herd than to actually give the right answer and be correct.
[00:40:08.655 --> 00:40:10.196]  Which kind of ties into what we were saying, right?
[00:40:10.196 --> 00:40:11.696]  Yeah, and that's a small-scale example.
[00:40:11.696 --> 00:40:13.497]  Listen to this big-scale example from CBS today.
[00:40:14.557 --> 00:40:19.179]  Experts, selfie-obsessed millennials increasingly opt for plastic surgery.
[00:40:19.179 --> 00:40:21.080]  And this is from CBS.
[00:40:21.080 --> 00:40:26.782]  It says, the pressure is so much for some that plastic surgeons say selfies are actually boosting their business.
[00:40:26.782 --> 00:40:28.042]  This is a quote from a doctor.
[00:40:28.042 --> 00:40:30.303]  I see a lot more people coming into my office.
[00:40:30.303 --> 00:40:38.907]  And the answer to the question, what bothers you and why did you decide to come see me, surprisingly enough, is I saw a selfie of myself and I hated it.
[00:40:38.907 --> 00:40:41.768]  I have to fix it, said Dr. Nicholas Nikoloff.
[00:40:42.228 --> 00:40:50.154]  Nikolaev is currently consulting with 23-year-old model Candice Wursten, who said she hates the shadows under her eyes in her selfies.
[00:40:50.154 --> 00:40:55.399]  Psychologist Sandy Hotchkiss says the boost has too many young people getting addicted to selfies.
[00:40:55.399 --> 00:41:05.487]  Quote, our values lean towards the shallow end of value pool, where things like physical beauty and material success are more important than things like compassion, courage, and kindness, she said.
[00:41:06.485 --> 00:41:07.286]  It's 100% true.
[00:41:07.286 --> 00:41:08.607]  Yeah.
[00:41:08.607 --> 00:41:29.842]  And if there's more studies and more information on this too, like compulsive texting takes toll on teenagers, what's happening is there is a wave of self-absorption that rids human compassion, rids human empathy, rids consciousness, rids passion, rids the ability to communicate and relate to other human beings.
[00:41:29.842 --> 00:41:31.563]  It's almost like a self-forming
[00:41:32.384 --> 00:41:34.064]  Void of communication.
[00:41:34.064 --> 00:41:35.605]  And we're just locked in.
[00:41:35.605 --> 00:41:36.585]  And we're all victims of this.
[00:41:36.585 --> 00:41:37.665]  By the way, we're not above this.
[00:41:37.665 --> 00:41:38.665]  We text all the time too.
[00:41:38.665 --> 00:41:40.226]  We're locked in our phones sometimes at dinner.
[00:41:40.226 --> 00:41:41.466]  We'll be looking at our phone.
[00:41:41.466 --> 00:41:45.607]  You know, we're not sitting here judging random people saying we're the best smart people in the world.
[00:41:45.607 --> 00:41:48.067]  But these people are getting plastic surgery over their selfies.
[00:41:48.067 --> 00:41:49.307]  They're losing sleep.
[00:41:49.307 --> 00:41:50.688]  This is the New York Times.
[00:41:50.688 --> 00:41:55.349]  Teenagers use text messaging more than any other mode of communication, so it may be hard to tell.
[00:41:55.349 --> 00:42:01.570]  But youngsters who check their phones continually snap if you interrupt them and are so preoccupied with texting they skip sleep.
[00:42:02.170 --> 00:42:07.213]  And don't get their work done, maybe compulsive texters, a new study says.
[00:42:07.213 --> 00:42:12.476]  For girls, compulsive texting is more than just a distraction, it is associated with lower academic performance.
[00:42:12.476 --> 00:42:19.480]  So they studied 400 8th graders and 11th graders and they were finding that they were losing sleep because they had to keep texting.
[00:42:19.480 --> 00:42:20.741]  They couldn't even go to sleep.
[00:42:20.741 --> 00:42:26.865]  They were texting all day, ignoring everything and losing sleep and feeling like crap the next day because they couldn't stop texting.
[00:42:27.648 --> 00:42:29.889]  No, I mean, this is completely insane.
[00:42:29.889 --> 00:42:40.635]  I went on holiday to the Caribbean earlier this year, and now literally a form of babysitting is giving a child an iPad and just, like, pushing them to the back of the room.
[00:42:40.635 --> 00:42:44.097]  Even in, like, a restaurant where, you know, it's supposed to be family time.
[00:42:44.097 --> 00:42:45.458]  This is your vacation.
[00:42:45.458 --> 00:42:53.902]  This is your two weeks where you have time to spend together with no distractions, no work, and they just give the, you know, six, seven-year-old kid an iPad.
[00:42:53.902 --> 00:42:55.163]  Ignore them for the whole night.
[00:42:56.283 --> 00:43:01.468]  Again, social media, the studies show is making people unhappy.
[00:43:01.468 --> 00:43:10.017]  Selfies, I don't even take, I probably take like one selfie every six months because obviously we need to carry our information via our personalities.
[00:43:10.017 --> 00:43:15.503]  But these people who, most of them don't even have many followers on Facebook or Twitter.
[00:43:15.643 --> 00:43:18.364]  Well they're posting to themselves is the weird thing too.
[00:43:18.364 --> 00:43:21.224]  If you go to the social media sites like Instagram they'll have like three followers.
[00:43:21.224 --> 00:43:31.467]  They're really posting to themselves so it's all a self-fulfilling weird prophecy of self-delusion because they act like they're posting to millions of people because that's what their favorite celebrities are doing.
[00:43:31.467 --> 00:43:36.108]  So they want to be their iconic favorite celebrities but in fact they're posting to no one.
[00:43:36.108 --> 00:43:42.850]  And if they don't look a little bit good they judge themselves and they have this weird cycle of self-hatred and it's all is coming out of this.
[00:43:43.690 --> 00:43:45.553]  And it's like phone-fubbing.
[00:43:45.553 --> 00:43:46.414]  Have you heard about this?
[00:43:46.414 --> 00:43:47.475]  Fubbing?
[00:43:47.475 --> 00:43:48.496]  So it's called fubbing.
[00:43:48.496 --> 00:43:54.644]  It's when you're sitting with someone at a dinner table or you're in a relationship or whatever and you're just on your phone all the time.
[00:43:54.644 --> 00:43:55.184]  Yeah.
[00:43:55.184 --> 00:44:00.531]  And it's ruining relationships to the point where Philly.com had to release an article
[00:44:00.791 --> 00:44:04.292]  How to keep phone snubbing or fubbing from ruining your love life.
[00:44:04.292 --> 00:44:06.032]  And it's like a serious article.
[00:44:06.032 --> 00:44:09.113]  And it talks about all the ways we can stop.
[00:44:09.113 --> 00:44:15.275]  Like, we can start making the phone game where if someone starts fubbing at dinner, they have to pay for the bill.
[00:44:15.275 --> 00:44:23.517]  Like, people are being proactive because people's relationships, according to the study, are being destroyed from people sitting on their phones not talking to each other.
[00:44:23.777 --> 00:44:24.017]  Yeah.
[00:44:24.017 --> 00:44:25.558]  And imagine growing up with this.
[00:44:25.558 --> 00:44:25.718]  Yeah.
[00:44:25.718 --> 00:44:29.560]  We just talked about, oh, here kids, go play with your iPhone or whatever.
[00:44:29.560 --> 00:44:37.705]  Imagine growing up with an iPhone from age two and that's all you're locked into, the Borg system, your communication skills are going to be zero.
[00:44:37.705 --> 00:44:38.525]  Yeah.
[00:44:38.525 --> 00:44:48.871]  And, you know, to clarify, there's nothing wrong with being on your phone when, like, for example, you're on public transport, when you're waiting for something else to happen, there's a time and place to be on your phone.
[00:44:49.451 --> 00:44:57.962]  But with that, for example, I mean, I've been out and seen couples who are obviously on dates with each other and, you know, sat opposite each other.
[00:44:57.962 --> 00:45:01.066]  I'm sat behind them so I can see what they're doing on their phone.
[00:45:01.066 --> 00:45:06.714]  And, like, the girl is literally on Tinder trying to find another date while she's on a date.
[00:45:07.154 --> 00:45:08.615]  It's gone so insane.
[00:45:08.615 --> 00:45:10.555]  And yeah, we're not judging people for using their phone.
[00:45:10.555 --> 00:45:11.856]  I use my phone all the time.
[00:45:11.856 --> 00:45:20.959]  It's just, I hate the fact that I use my phone all the time as well, and I know it is a bad thing to do, and I know it's bad to be locked into only these systems, not to mention tracking everything you do.
[00:45:20.959 --> 00:45:26.101]  When you agree to install those apps, if you read the fine print on your phone, it says, yes, we track whatever.
[00:45:26.101 --> 00:45:27.521]  We track everything you do.
[00:45:27.521 --> 00:45:30.943]  All of this is just designed to be locked into the complete Borg system.
[00:45:30.943 --> 00:45:31.183]  Period.
[00:45:31.943 --> 00:45:35.725]  And at least, you know, put it in airplane mode before you go to bed, right?
[00:45:35.725 --> 00:45:44.049]  I mean, you know, my girlfriend has it on a bedside table, has it turned on so every time it buzzes at like 3, 4am it wakes her up.
[00:45:44.049 --> 00:45:51.552]  And studies have shown that if you look at your phone right before sleeping it fires up different areas of your brain that prevent you from being able to get to sleep.
[00:45:51.952 --> 00:46:09.120]  Yeah, and it stops the production of melatonin, because if you think about it, we weren't meant to sit and watch artificial lights all night, like the computer screen, before we go to bed, and that stops the production of melatonin, because light interferes with the production of melatonin, so if you sleep with the light on too, but also an electronic device, you're not getting the melatonin you need, and you're not going to be able to sleep well.
[00:46:09.120 --> 00:46:16.503]  You're going to feel like crap the next morning, and then that is why we have the computer syndrome, which is where everyone's on the computer until 2 a.m.
[00:46:16.503 --> 00:46:20.885]  at night, and they go to bed, and they can't sleep properly, they can't get the rest they need, the REM sleep,
[00:46:21.405 --> 00:46:24.428]  And it's just, it is messing up the human body completely.
[00:46:24.428 --> 00:46:25.850]  And it's making people depressed.
[00:46:25.850 --> 00:46:41.827]  I mean, all the studies show, Facebook and Twitter, because Facebook, for example, is a highlight reel of somebody's life, other people look at that and think, my God, they're having such an exciting life, they're out all the time, they're doing all these different activities, they're meeting all these different people.
[00:46:42.347 --> 00:46:44.928]  That's not on a day-to-day basis, right?
[00:46:44.928 --> 00:46:46.488]  Those are the highlights.
[00:46:46.488 --> 00:46:56.992]  So then they get jealous, they get insecure that they're, you know, not as much socially welcoming, socially accepted as the individuals who are posting all these photos on Facebook.
[00:46:56.992 --> 00:46:58.212]  And it makes them depressed.
[00:46:58.212 --> 00:46:59.273]  The studies have shown that.
[00:46:59.873 --> 00:47:03.657]  We waste an inordinate amount of time on social media.
[00:47:03.657 --> 00:47:04.839]  I'm guilty of that.
[00:47:04.839 --> 00:47:06.400]  Basically just arguing with people.
[00:47:06.400 --> 00:47:07.562]  We're trying to get a message out.
[00:47:07.562 --> 00:47:10.024]  And you know, I think it all also ties in with political correctness.
[00:47:10.024 --> 00:47:12.107]  We were talking about that the other day as well.
[00:47:12.107 --> 00:47:18.874]  All of this is essentially a template to change society for better or for worse, right?
[00:47:18.874 --> 00:47:19.455]  With Facebook
[00:47:19.935 --> 00:47:24.519]  With Instagram, with even social communications on a text-based level.
[00:47:24.519 --> 00:47:27.341]  All this is a template to reach other people.
[00:47:27.341 --> 00:47:30.904]  And whatever message you choose to get to others is your choice, obviously.
[00:47:30.904 --> 00:47:37.510]  But we can, of course, be propagandized into spreading different messages, whether it's political correctness or whatever.
[00:47:37.510 --> 00:47:40.613]  And all these social platforms, it seems, have different audience types.
[00:47:40.613 --> 00:47:44.956]  But we're talking about something like Tumblr versus like Facebook versus all these things.
[00:47:44.956 --> 00:47:47.759]  What has happened is political correctness has seeped in.
[00:47:48.479 --> 00:48:03.324]  And it has become a hot social topic to discuss, and it has become something, and I know you're going to talk more about this in the next hour with Gad Satt, but political correctness is the virus of social media that I believe is thriving.
[00:48:03.324 --> 00:48:04.985]  You know, we talked about this the other day as well.
[00:48:05.458 --> 00:48:11.622]  Yeah, it's thriving through this outrage culture that has been cultivated by social media.
[00:48:11.622 --> 00:48:22.450]  It's an echo chamber whereby one opinion, one judgment of somebody's behavior or words can be amplified to such an extent that it goes completely out of proportion.
[00:48:22.450 --> 00:48:29.155]  And again, most of these people aren't going to do anything, they're not actually going to call anybody up, they're not going to go to a protest, they're not going to do anything physical.
[00:48:29.795 --> 00:48:35.702]  They're just going to tweet out a hashtag, which is very much what happened with the Black Lives Matter movement, which we're going to talk about.
[00:48:35.702 --> 00:48:49.399]  But it creates this echo chamber that seems so intimidating to somebody who's on the receiving end of it, which is why these people apologize over and over again for making politically incorrect statements, when the true course of action
[00:48:49.719 --> 00:48:59.165]  And the only successful course of action should be to stand by what you said and not be intimidated by these social media outrage mobs.
[00:48:59.165 --> 00:49:00.426]  But the power has devolved.
[00:49:00.426 --> 00:49:02.767]  It's gone from being in the hands of the state.
[00:49:02.767 --> 00:49:09.432]  Now it's in the hands of these outrage mobs exercising that power through the echo chamber of Twitter.
[00:49:09.432 --> 00:49:14.595]  And basically people need to stand up and realize that it doesn't have as much power as they think it does, right?
[00:49:14.815 --> 00:49:19.717]  It's like the most radically insane groups tend to throw some of the most power for whatever reason.
[00:49:19.717 --> 00:49:22.278]  People need to understand that we want real talk.
[00:49:22.278 --> 00:49:23.519]  The public wants real talk.
[00:49:23.519 --> 00:49:25.120]  That's why Trump is surging in the polls.
[00:49:25.120 --> 00:49:27.361]  It doesn't even matter his policies to most people.
[00:49:27.361 --> 00:49:29.221]  They like the fact that he does some real talk.
[00:49:29.221 --> 00:49:30.202]  Some real talk.
[00:49:30.202 --> 00:49:34.824]  If you look at the biggest YouTube personalities, you look at the biggest commentator personalities, including yourself, Paul.
[00:49:35.544 --> 00:49:37.106]  Everyone wants real talk.
[00:49:37.106 --> 00:49:38.067]  And guess what?
[00:49:38.067 --> 00:49:39.208]  I love everybody.
[00:49:39.208 --> 00:49:40.329]  I really do.
[00:49:40.329 --> 00:49:44.773]  I'm going to say some politically incorrect things sometimes because it's important to reach people.
[00:49:44.773 --> 00:49:46.935]  We're all going to make mistakes sometimes.
[00:49:46.935 --> 00:49:51.439]  We're putting ourselves in the public platform, recording videos, trying our best to help people.
[00:49:51.439 --> 00:49:52.260]  We're going to make mistakes.
[00:49:52.260 --> 00:49:53.321]  We're going to make some bad decisions.
[00:49:53.321 --> 00:49:54.382]  We're going to do some stupid things.
[00:49:54.382 --> 00:49:55.883]  But at least it's real.
[00:49:55.883 --> 00:49:56.324]  At least it's 100%.
[00:49:57.725 --> 00:49:59.046]  In the right message.
[00:49:59.046 --> 00:50:00.527]  We're passionate about it.
[00:50:00.527 --> 00:50:01.267]  And people want that.
[00:50:01.267 --> 00:50:04.069]  They don't want the fake cardboard cutout.
[00:50:04.069 --> 00:50:05.029]  They don't want that.
[00:50:05.029 --> 00:50:06.490]  There's no room for that.
[00:50:06.490 --> 00:50:07.090]  That's not real.
[00:50:07.090 --> 00:50:08.271]  That's not invigorating.
[00:50:08.271 --> 00:50:10.412]  That's not thriving the media system.
[00:50:10.412 --> 00:50:14.555]  That's not doing anything when we sit there and we have to script everything we say.
[00:50:14.555 --> 00:50:17.296]  This is completely teleprompter-free, completely unscripted.
[00:50:17.296 --> 00:50:21.459]  I have three articles here and we just went off of all this for over 30 plus minutes really.
[00:50:22.259 --> 00:50:27.325]  And went into these subjects that matter, and people like that, and people resonate with that, and they want inspiration.
[00:50:27.325 --> 00:50:33.052]  They don't want someone to sit up here and say, well, we don't want to say anything that we don't mean and it would offend someone.
[00:50:33.052 --> 00:50:35.275]  The age of political correctness is dying.
[00:50:36.366 --> 00:50:40.008]  And political correctness is based on self-censorship.
[00:50:40.008 --> 00:50:45.451]  It's being completely frightened to death to even speak for fear of saying something that might offend somebody.
[00:50:45.451 --> 00:50:46.992]  That's why it's so pervasive.
[00:50:46.992 --> 00:50:48.772]  That's why it's so insidious.
[00:50:48.772 --> 00:50:51.534]  We'll be back to talk about it with your calls after the break.
[00:50:51.534 --> 00:50:51.714]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:50:51.714 --> 00:50:52.514]  Alex Jones Show Live.
[00:50:52.514 --> 00:50:52.895]  Infowars.com.

[00:51:14.431 --> 00:51:18.395]  Communist China freely allows the sale of bulletproof armor plates, while our U.S.
[00:51:18.395 --> 00:51:21.478]  politicians argue from banning Americans from owning body armor.
[00:51:21.478 --> 00:51:23.040]  Does that sound right to you?
[00:51:23.040 --> 00:51:26.283]  Arm your American body at InfidelBodyArmor.com.
[00:51:26.283 --> 00:51:29.166]  Infidel Body Armor just won't quit.
[00:51:29.166 --> 00:51:37.855]  Silver has always been nature's very own antibiotic, and only one system allows you to produce an endless supply of nano-sized silver solutions right from the convenience of your home.
[00:51:38.055 --> 00:51:39.136]  Silver Lungs.
[00:51:39.136 --> 00:51:46.439]  With the addition of our unique lung delivery system, respiratory infections are targeted directly, where traditional oral administration simply cannot reach.
[00:51:46.439 --> 00:51:52.462]  This pioneering method also preserves the original particle sizes and delivers your silver solution directly into the bloodstream.
[00:51:52.462 --> 00:51:56.604]  See the Silver Lungs generator and lung delivery system at SilverLungs.com.
[00:51:56.604 --> 00:51:58.865]  That's SilverLungs.com.
[00:51:58.865 --> 00:52:00.226]  A sudden change in the wind.
[00:52:00.746 --> 00:52:07.234]  The day grows dark as ominous clouds move in and lightning begins to carve arcs in the sky.
[00:52:07.234 --> 00:52:11.639]  And you realize you are not prepared.
[00:52:11.639 --> 00:52:16.005]  Tornadoes, hurricanes, and floods can turn your world upside down.
[00:52:16.005 --> 00:52:18.808]  And if you are choosing to rely on the government to save you.
[00:52:18.808 --> 00:52:20.150]  And no one's coming to help them.
[00:52:20.390 --> 00:52:22.051]  You could be dead wrong.
[00:52:22.051 --> 00:52:27.313]  The first step towards self-reliance in the face of disaster is a visit to PowerPrepper.com.
[00:52:27.313 --> 00:52:30.094]  PowerPrepper.com has partnered with Numana.

[00:54:00.728 --> 00:54:04.056]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[00:54:04.056 --> 00:54:07.344]  It's Alex Jones, only on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:54:15.962 --> 00:54:16.803]  We're back live.
[00:54:16.803 --> 00:54:19.645]  It's the Alex Jones Show with me, your host, Paul Joseph Watson.
[00:54:19.645 --> 00:54:23.048]  Gad Sad coming up at the bottom of the next hour.
[00:54:23.048 --> 00:54:27.973]  Gonna go to your calls here in a moment, but I just wanted to mention InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:54:27.973 --> 00:54:30.135]  We've got 20% off B12.
[00:54:30.135 --> 00:54:32.237]  We've got discounts on other products.
[00:54:32.737 --> 00:54:34.998]  And again, this is what drives the whole operation.
[00:54:34.998 --> 00:54:37.438]  This is what has allowed us to build this studio.
[00:54:37.438 --> 00:54:44.140]  We're building another studio, we're hiring more people, trying to have a bigger reach, have a bigger impact.
[00:54:44.140 --> 00:54:48.481]  20% off B12 at infowarsstore.com.

[00:54:54.062 --> 00:54:55.863]  And this is what drives the whole operation.
[00:54:55.863 --> 00:54:57.183]  We really need your support.
[00:54:58.226 --> 00:55:03.368]  Excellent products, third-party reviews there you see, and basically people love these products.
[00:55:03.368 --> 00:55:06.690]  They're really having a great impact on their day-to-day lives.
[00:55:06.690 --> 00:55:08.710]  They couldn't come more highly recommended.
[00:55:08.710 --> 00:55:10.391]  Gonna go to your calls now.
[00:55:10.391 --> 00:55:14.713]  Kevin in Florida, you're on the air, go ahead Kevin.
[00:55:14.713 --> 00:55:17.114]  Thank you so much Paul.
[00:55:17.114 --> 00:55:19.035]  I appreciate you taking my call.
[00:55:19.035 --> 00:55:21.796]  My question actually kind of ties in to what you and I
[00:55:22.463 --> 00:55:27.565]  You were talking about earlier with people and just being so ignorant and dumb.
[00:55:27.565 --> 00:55:32.607]  I work as a manager in a retail chain, so I deal with people from all over the world.
[00:55:32.607 --> 00:55:33.867]  And I totally agree, man.
[00:55:33.867 --> 00:55:36.788]  I feel like the population is so dumbed down.
[00:55:36.788 --> 00:55:40.150]  The majority of the people have no idea what's going on.
[00:55:40.150 --> 00:55:43.311]  They believe everything the mainstream media tells them, which is sad.
[00:55:43.311 --> 00:55:45.812]  There's no free fingers anymore.
[00:55:45.812 --> 00:55:49.773]  Nobody wants to get outside the box and express themselves.
[00:55:49.773 --> 00:55:51.014]  And my question for you was,
[00:55:51.684 --> 00:55:56.750]  How is that going to change, or is it going to change, and what is it going to take to change that?
[00:55:56.750 --> 00:56:02.177]  Because I feel like it's going to take an outright revolution for people to give back what they rightfully deserve.
[00:56:05.347 --> 00:56:14.770]  We can't get too disheartened, we can't get too downhearted about it because you do go out amongst the general population and you get this sense that everybody is dumbed down.
[00:56:14.770 --> 00:56:21.293]  But then you look on the internet, you know, you look at YouTube and people are really becoming more aware of how they're being manipulated.
[00:56:21.293 --> 00:56:23.954]  Trust in government is at all-time lows.
[00:56:23.954 --> 00:56:27.495]  Trust in mainstream media is at all-time lows.
[00:56:27.495 --> 00:56:32.177]  So then that creates a vacuum for a new source of information to come in and have an impact.
[00:56:32.617 --> 00:56:34.638]  Which, you know, is not necessarily always good.
[00:56:34.638 --> 00:56:37.160]  There's disinfo in the alternative media.
[00:56:37.160 --> 00:56:42.624]  But at least people have lost faith in the established traditions of government and media.
[00:56:42.624 --> 00:56:45.686]  At least there's some kind of vacuum that we can go in and fill.
[00:56:45.686 --> 00:56:47.848]  So that's the positive that I take from that, Anthony.
[00:56:48.448 --> 00:56:56.353]  I would agree with that, and I would also say that more and more I do see millions of people saying, hey, something's wrong with this system, getting informed about it, and rising up.
[00:56:56.353 --> 00:57:04.458]  I would also say that at some point in pretty much all of our lives, I'm not aware of anyone that was born with the understanding of what was going on.
[00:57:04.458 --> 00:57:07.080]  We were one of those quote-unquote dumbed-down people.
[00:57:07.080 --> 00:57:08.180]  Yeah, like when we were 18.
[00:57:08.180 --> 00:57:09.821]  I mean, I didn't know anything.
[00:57:09.821 --> 00:57:11.863]  Because you've got to give people the chance.
[00:57:11.863 --> 00:57:13.303]  You can't just write them off, right?
[00:57:13.303 --> 00:57:13.744]  Exactly.
[00:57:13.744 --> 00:57:16.686]  I don't like the idea that these idiots out here, I hate them all.
[00:57:16.686 --> 00:57:17.106]  I mean, look,
[00:57:18.064 --> 00:57:19.725]  Obviously there's some dumbed down people.
[00:57:19.725 --> 00:57:21.185]  Obviously there's some people that need help.
[00:57:21.185 --> 00:57:29.509]  It's up to us to actually help them as opposed to criticize these people and say, and I'm not saying you're doing that, by the way, Kevin, I understand what you're saying.
[00:57:29.509 --> 00:57:31.110]  Trust me, I completely understand.
[00:57:31.110 --> 00:57:39.254]  But I'm saying it's our mission to try and help these people and awaken them up to the level that hopefully we are and maybe, you know, there's more for us to learn as well.
[00:57:39.254 --> 00:57:46.017]  But at the same time, I see millions and millions and millions of people waking up saying that something is wrong and I see a solution on the horizon.
[00:57:47.116 --> 00:57:52.858]  And I think part of it is, again, going back to what we said earlier, people don't talk to each other.
[00:57:52.858 --> 00:57:58.859]  So you just immediately assume that somebody's dumb and somebody's ignorant and doesn't know about any of these issues.
[00:57:58.859 --> 00:58:06.341]  But then when you actually converse with people, interact with them, as we did up on that mountain when this group of young people, probably about 16, 17, 18, approached us,
[00:58:08.682 --> 00:58:11.164]  Simply because they were resonating with what we were saying.
[00:58:11.164 --> 00:58:12.945]  And that's the next generation.
[00:58:12.945 --> 00:58:14.766]  So you can't get too downhearted about it.
[00:58:14.766 --> 00:58:18.988]  You've got to realize that you have to interact with people to know where they're coming from.
[00:58:18.988 --> 00:58:20.029]  And there is hope.
[00:58:20.029 --> 00:58:23.551]  And that's why InfoWars has grown to be such a huge operation.
[00:58:23.551 --> 00:58:28.794]  So that's why we're going to continue reaching out to people, trying to expand into different areas.
[00:58:28.794 --> 00:58:31.555]  More of your calls coming up after the break.
[00:58:31.555 --> 00:58:32.796]  I'm Paul Joseph Watson.
[00:58:32.796 --> 00:58:34.577]  It's the Alex Jones Show Live.

[01:00:05.768 --> 01:00:10.590]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:00:10.590 --> 01:00:12.170]  You want answers?
[01:00:12.170 --> 01:00:13.711]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.711 --> 01:00:17.912]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.912 --> 01:00:21.994]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:30.493 --> 01:00:32.494]  Second hour of the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:32.494 --> 01:00:35.415]  We've got Gad Saad coming up at the bottom of the hour.
[01:00:35.415 --> 01:00:36.675]  He's a psychologist.
[01:00:36.675 --> 01:00:37.956]  He's a behavioral scientist.
[01:00:37.956 --> 01:00:46.158]  He's going to talk about the motivations behind human behavior, why people embrace political correctness and what we can do to counter that.
[01:00:46.158 --> 01:00:49.599]  Basically, we want to take some positive calls.
[01:00:49.599 --> 01:00:53.761]  There's a lot of negativity around about, you know, and we embrace some of that too, let's be fair.
[01:00:54.380 --> 01:01:00.406]  You know, everybody's dumb, nobody's awake, nobody's paying attention, but obviously they are, otherwise we wouldn't have got to this position.
[01:01:00.406 --> 01:01:05.531]  Obviously people are losing faith in establishment, you know, institutions.
[01:01:05.531 --> 01:01:10.957]  DrudgeReport.com has a headline, Shock Poll Clinton Loses to Any Republican.
[01:01:10.957 --> 01:01:16.842]  And remember back at Bilderberg, she was the chosen one, she was the candidate for the establishment for 2016.
[01:01:18.504 --> 01:01:21.145]  Within months, she's completely collapsed.
[01:01:21.145 --> 01:01:25.026]  Now she's basically going to lose to anyone that runs against her.
[01:01:25.026 --> 01:01:33.429]  Which again is why the GOP establishment is now trying to sink Trump, because at least to some extent he's a maverick, he's unpredictable.
[01:01:33.429 --> 01:01:35.549]  And that's intolerable to control freaks.
[01:01:35.549 --> 01:01:37.390]  So again, people are losing faith.
[01:01:37.390 --> 01:01:38.931]  They're looking for alternatives.
[01:01:38.931 --> 01:01:42.592]  We have to exploit this and turn it into a positive.
[01:01:42.592 --> 01:01:45.413]  I'm going to go to Orlean in Canada.
[01:01:45.413 --> 01:01:46.393]  You're on the air, go ahead.
[01:01:49.690 --> 01:01:52.051]  Hey, go ahead, what's your point?
[01:01:52.051 --> 01:02:02.573]  So, I'm back from the dead and I'm looking for revenge with my arsenal of empowering information.
[01:02:02.573 --> 01:02:04.193]  Good.
[01:02:04.193 --> 01:02:05.234]  And what's your arsenal?
[01:02:05.234 --> 01:02:07.354]  What's in your arsenal?
[01:02:07.354 --> 01:02:11.595]  So I have 10 steps to increase your consciousness.
[01:02:12.583 --> 01:02:20.860]  Okay, from the most fundamental, the most foundational, to the most powerful and the most high-spirited.
[01:02:20.860 --> 01:02:23.065]  Okay, give us the top two, go ahead.
[01:02:24.110 --> 01:02:25.111]  The top two?
[01:02:25.111 --> 01:02:25.531]  Yeah.
[01:02:25.531 --> 01:02:27.512]  Okay, I'll go through it very quickly.
[01:02:27.512 --> 01:02:29.133]  One, forced breathing.
[01:02:29.133 --> 01:02:30.894]  You want to get oxygen in your system.
[01:02:30.894 --> 01:02:35.477]  If you can't get oxygen, if your nose is plugged, use some nasal spray.
[01:02:35.477 --> 01:02:36.998]  Get oxygen in your system.
[01:02:36.998 --> 01:02:38.759]  Number two, water.
[01:02:38.759 --> 01:02:43.022]  Distilled water, clean water, the cleanest water you can find.
[01:02:43.022 --> 01:02:45.163]  Get water in your system, very important.
[01:02:45.163 --> 01:02:51.287]  If you talk, number three, if you talk to, uh, if you talk to
[01:02:52.012 --> 01:03:00.802]  Marathon runners, they carb load, so tropical fruit will give you intense amounts of energy.
[01:03:00.802 --> 01:03:05.647]  Fruit juice, fresh, freshly juiced fruits.
[01:03:05.647 --> 01:03:08.691]  Number four would be amino acids.
[01:03:08.691 --> 01:03:12.275]  You want to get these from fish, turkey, eggs,
[01:03:12.978 --> 01:03:14.800]  We want to avoid dairy.
[01:03:31.113 --> 01:03:38.397]  Everything picked up, my attitude picked up, and that is really a starting point which everyone can grasp onto to begin this journey, right?
[01:03:38.397 --> 01:03:44.120]  It's true, and I would also say people need to start treating their brain like they do their stomachs.
[01:03:44.120 --> 01:03:46.021]  Stop feeding it junk.
[01:03:46.021 --> 01:03:51.304]  So the consumption that we get on a daily basis from our body and our brain is very similar.
[01:03:51.304 --> 01:03:56.067]  If we're watching the mainstream media all day and stupid television shows, we're feeding our brain junk.
[01:03:56.687 --> 01:04:00.010]  But if we're eating junk, we're feeding our bodies junk.
[01:04:00.010 --> 01:04:02.993]  And there's a correlation because we know the gut is the second brain.
[01:04:02.993 --> 01:04:04.534]  We know the gut correlates with the brain.
[01:04:04.534 --> 01:04:05.495]  It sends nerve signals.
[01:04:05.495 --> 01:04:07.717]  We know the heart has neurons in it as well.
[01:04:07.717 --> 01:04:14.663]  But overall, yeah, if one of the number one things you can do, for example, is wake up within 30 minutes, eat 30 grams of protein.
[01:04:15.063 --> 01:04:18.806]  It's been found to boost metabolism, make you feel better, lose weight throughout the day.
[01:04:18.806 --> 01:04:23.630]  Another thing you can do is drink warm lemon water in the morning to supercharge your body.
[01:04:23.630 --> 01:04:25.271]  I mean, there's numerous things.
[01:04:25.271 --> 01:04:31.596]  I mean, Orlean says he's come back from the dead, so I don't think I have that type of esoteric knowledge, but I do know a few things about health.
[01:04:31.596 --> 01:04:33.997]  So really just making an effort is key, I believe.
[01:04:35.198 --> 01:04:37.821]  Okay, we'll be back with more of your calls after the break.
[01:04:37.821 --> 01:04:39.984]  We've got Cole, Erica, Patrick and Phil.
[01:04:39.984 --> 01:04:44.088]  1-800-259-9231, Anthony Gucciardi.
[01:04:44.088 --> 01:04:47.672]  In studio again, Gadsad coming up after the break.
[01:04:47.672 --> 01:04:51.517]  We're going to hear a ton more news here on the Alex Jones Show Live.
[01:04:51.517 --> 01:04:53.459]  I'm Paul Joseph Watson, InfoWars.com.
[01:04:59.779 --> 01:05:07.464]  Joe Biggs here with InfoWars.com, Black Lives Matter movement going global to combat gun-toting white racists.
[01:05:07.464 --> 01:05:10.987]  That's right, if you're white and you carry a gun, you're a racist!
[01:05:10.987 --> 01:05:14.849]  Welcome to the brand new America, brought to you by Barack Obama.
[01:05:14.849 --> 01:05:25.056]  Article up at InfoWars.com, Breitbart's Big Journalism covered a weekend event hosted by MSNBC's Touré in Los Angeles that featured several Black Lives Matter leaders.
[01:05:25.256 --> 01:05:35.300]  The panelists convened on this first annual Politicon to discuss how the movement is going global and carrying its message of antipathy against white racism around the world.
[01:05:35.300 --> 01:05:39.462]  Is Barack Obama actually trying to start World War III?
[01:05:39.462 --> 01:05:42.043]  Article up at InfoWars.com.
[01:05:42.043 --> 01:05:51.047]  Why has Barack Obama airdropped 50 tons of ammunition into areas that moderate rebels in Syria supposedly control?
[01:05:51.047 --> 01:05:54.849]  This is essentially the equivalent of poking the Russians directly in the eyes.
[01:05:55.069 --> 01:05:58.090]  You can find more reports like this at InfoWars.com
[01:05:59.500 --> 01:06:03.021]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[01:06:03.021 --> 01:06:11.262]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[01:06:11.262 --> 01:06:16.684]  Just one of the key compounds, BioPQQ, is backed by major clinical studies.
[01:06:16.684 --> 01:06:19.204]  You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?
[01:06:19.204 --> 01:06:21.305]  We now have the synergistic solution.
[01:06:21.305 --> 01:06:25.505]  Secure your DNA force today at InfoWarsLife.com or call toll-free 888-253-3139.
[01:06:29.338 --> 01:06:30.459]  BrainForce is here.
[01:06:30.459 --> 01:06:32.659]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months.
[01:06:32.659 --> 01:06:37.662]  You've probably noticed I've been more focused, less brain fog, more energy, and it's because of BrainForce.
[01:06:37.662 --> 01:06:40.943]  There's always hidden additives in your food, even organic food has hidden additives.
[01:06:40.943 --> 01:06:44.425]  Staring at the computer all day, working, doing good, you're still damaging your brain.
[01:06:44.425 --> 01:06:46.406]  Ultimately, we've all been dumbed down to some degree.
[01:06:46.406 --> 01:06:48.506]  It doesn't have stimulants, it doesn't have garbage in it.
[01:06:48.506 --> 01:06:50.527]  It has natural things that do it clean.
[01:06:50.527 --> 01:06:56.130]  You will find BrainForce and other game-changing products at InfoWarsLife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[01:06:59.164 --> 01:06:59.744]  I want more candy!
[01:06:59.744 --> 01:07:00.705]  I want more video games!
[01:07:00.705 --> 01:07:02.386]  Mine, mine, mine!
[01:07:02.386 --> 01:07:12.130]  And it's that type of behavior that spurred me to do the research to develop a true nutraceutical formula that was designed to smooth out and help children focus.
[01:07:12.130 --> 01:07:14.832]  All of our children are hit with modern mind control.
[01:07:14.832 --> 01:07:18.374]  Television, music, fast food, GMOs, sugars, you name it.
[01:07:18.374 --> 01:07:24.717]  Young humans have not yet developed their nervous system and are being hammered daily by globalist concoctions.
[01:07:24.717 --> 01:07:27.218]  It's no wonder they can't focus and calm down.
[01:07:27.418 --> 01:07:29.839]  And then are put on dangerous psychotropic drugs.
[01:07:29.839 --> 01:07:36.223]  Working with my team, we set out to find the best formula with the highest quality ingredients that children would actually like and take.
[01:07:36.223 --> 01:07:43.668]  We worked with the leading manufacturer in nutritional supplements that are safe for children to bring you the most affordable and powerful calming formula out there.
[01:07:43.948 --> 01:07:51.491]  Introducing ChildEase with herbs and calming extracts like chamomile and lemon balm and essential nutrients that taste great.
[01:07:51.491 --> 01:07:55.092]  Obtain your ChildEase today at InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:07:55.092 --> 01:08:02.555]  That's ChildEase exclusively at InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:08:02.555 --> 01:08:09.178]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:08:09.178 --> 01:08:12.159]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:23.996 --> 01:08:24.937]  We're back live.
[01:08:24.937 --> 01:08:29.261]  It's the Alex Jones Show with me, your host Paul Joseph Watson and Anthony Guiciardi.
[01:08:29.261 --> 01:08:31.903]  More of your calls coming up in a moment.
[01:08:31.903 --> 01:08:35.066]  But we were just handed this story which is quite amazing.
[01:08:35.066 --> 01:08:40.210]  It ties into what we were talking about regarding social media about 10-20 minutes ago.
[01:08:40.210 --> 01:08:41.091]  Anthony, what's the story?
[01:08:41.331 --> 01:08:54.656]  We were talking about the collapse of society earlier and the delusion of fubbing, which is basically where you're on your cell phone so much that it ruins your relationships and how people's egos are destroyed by social media likes and everything like that.
[01:08:54.656 --> 01:08:56.837]  Here's a story that just came out in the Daily Mail.
[01:08:56.837 --> 01:09:00.779]  It's actually horribly disturbing, but so ridiculous.
[01:09:00.779 --> 01:09:08.562]  Newlywed wife, 20, hangs herself after her Indian husband takes away her phone because she was always on Facebook and WhatsApp.
[01:09:09.142 --> 01:09:11.884]  Her husband said she spent too much time on Facebook and WhatsApp.
[01:09:11.884 --> 01:09:15.667]  He took her phone during a row, after which she locked herself in her room.
[01:09:15.667 --> 01:09:18.729]  When he later kicked down the door, he found she had committed suicide.
[01:09:18.729 --> 01:09:24.193]  And this is, to me, it's obviously disturbing.
[01:09:24.193 --> 01:09:25.294]  It's ridiculous.
[01:09:25.294 --> 01:09:36.963]  But it's just a view into the true ridiculousness of how some people, not all people, but some people, just like Paul talked about a study earlier when everyone would go along with what everyone else was saying, some people take it to the next level.
[01:09:37.543 --> 01:09:45.693]  Obviously this woman was most likely mentally ill, but we have to remember that when people really get addicted to these kind of things, they take it seriously.
[01:09:45.693 --> 01:09:53.361]  And on a smaller level, people are taking it seriously when they post their selfies and they have to get plastic surgery because they think they look ugly.
[01:09:53.361 --> 01:09:57.486]  I mean, this society is becoming so self-absorbed, so sick.
[01:09:58.547 --> 01:10:02.690]  That people are killing themselves because their cell phones have been taken away.
[01:10:02.690 --> 01:10:04.272]  Not on a large scale, obviously.
[01:10:04.272 --> 01:10:07.154]  This is apparently, hopefully, an isolated incident.
[01:10:07.154 --> 01:10:09.276]  But it did happen, and it's very disturbing.
[01:10:10.652 --> 01:10:15.353]  And there's also a huge problem with narcissism again which drives depression.
[01:10:15.353 --> 01:10:35.097]  You know, I know people that are depressed and you can clearly see that it's due to their narcissism and it's due to their goals not being fulfilled because they spend all their time on Facebook posting selfies trying to draw attention to their appearance while not actually achieving anything in their careers in what they want to do with their lives.
[01:10:35.097 --> 01:10:37.277]  Well that's why there's so many models these days too.
[01:10:37.677 --> 01:10:45.166]  Unfortunately, because mainly females, they grow up thinking that in this society, it's their looks that are going to get them places.
[01:10:45.166 --> 01:10:45.726]  It's their looks.
[01:10:45.726 --> 01:10:48.169]  It's not about their output, what they actually do.
[01:10:48.169 --> 01:10:52.454]  It's kind of as above so below, though, because this country does nothing, too.
[01:10:52.454 --> 01:10:54.396]  We don't produce anything anymore.
[01:10:54.396 --> 01:10:58.181]  Well, the citizens don't really produce anything anymore on a pretty large scale as well.
[01:10:58.661 --> 01:11:04.105]  It's almost like we're outsourcing all of our responsibilities as human beings as well.
[01:11:04.105 --> 01:11:08.409]  It's like our country production is shut off so we, as human individuals, aren't doing that much either.
[01:11:09.324 --> 01:11:32.123]  And again, that ties into social media, because you have this phenomenon of virtue signaling, which is basically people sending out hashtags, people backing politically correct causes, simply to earn social brownie points amongst their liberal progressive friends, without actually going out or attending a single protest, writing a single letter, you know, filming a single YouTube video.
[01:11:32.663 --> 01:11:33.703]  They do it to be cool.
[01:11:33.703 --> 01:11:34.723]  They do it to be trendy.
[01:11:34.723 --> 01:11:37.704]  They do it to earn social approval from their friends.
[01:11:37.704 --> 01:11:45.886]  And it's this lazy click, you know, hashtag activism that is completely nebulous and meaningless in the long term.
[01:11:45.886 --> 01:11:48.746]  But they need to do it to get that social approval.
[01:11:48.746 --> 01:11:51.687]  And that's why we have people obsessed with selfies.
[01:11:51.687 --> 01:11:53.227]  We have models on Instagram.
[01:11:53.227 --> 01:11:56.888]  All they do is post, you know, 20, 30 pictures of themselves a day.
[01:11:56.888 --> 01:11:59.169]  But, you know, some people are receptive to that.
[01:11:59.169 --> 01:12:00.589]  Some people have success with that.
[01:12:01.129 --> 01:12:12.654]  And again, to create that kind of society that has no substance, no actual conviction, with people following through on their beliefs, that's exactly what we have to counter on a daily basis.
[01:12:12.654 --> 01:12:14.694]  Let's go to more of your calls.
[01:12:14.694 --> 01:12:18.196]  Let's go to Dave in California who wants to talk about political correctness.
[01:12:18.196 --> 01:12:20.397]  Dave, you're on the air, go ahead.
[01:12:20.397 --> 01:12:22.658]  Hey, thanks, Paul, it's good to talk to you, man.
[01:12:22.658 --> 01:12:23.278]  Good to talk to you.
[01:12:26.280 --> 01:12:31.922]  Okay, so on your book, Order Out of Chaos, is that still available?
[01:12:31.922 --> 01:12:36.723]  I read most of it a long time ago and then I lost it in a computer crash.
[01:12:36.723 --> 01:12:45.385]  It's still available on PrisonPlanet.tv, you can get the PDF, so you can go on PrisonPlanet.tv, log in, it'll be on the books section.
[01:12:45.385 --> 01:12:47.086]  Excellent, I will do that, thank you.
[01:12:47.086 --> 01:12:51.407]  And on the subject of political correctness and insulting people,
[01:12:53.683 --> 01:12:57.478]  I have a small Facebook following, mostly just my real friends, but...
[01:12:58.311 --> 01:13:14.319]  I find that I can go to sites that firefighters hang out at, lots of them, and I will usually, a few times a year, put out a bunch of what I consider to be really relevant 9-11 issues.
[01:13:14.319 --> 01:13:23.884]  In particular, lately I've been focusing on Kevin Ryan stuff, which I find fascinating, and I love the fact that he actually fingers
[01:13:24.524 --> 01:13:26.566]  The real culprits of 9-11.
[01:13:26.566 --> 01:13:29.029]  I'd like to see you guys get him on if possible.
[01:13:29.029 --> 01:13:36.115]  But I never retract anything, I don't care if it insults people or not, unless it's in error.
[01:13:36.115 --> 01:13:41.280]  You know, I occasionally get snagged by something when I'm out there, you know, getting excited.
[01:13:41.280 --> 01:13:44.744]  No, I mean, that is the point of this Twitter outrage phenomenon.
[01:13:44.744 --> 01:13:45.664]  The power lies
[01:13:46.385 --> 01:13:53.107]  For them, for the outrage mob, for the professionally offended, the power lies in you relenting and backing down and retracting.
[01:13:53.107 --> 01:13:57.729]  Now, of course, unless you've made an error, never back down, never apologize.
[01:13:57.729 --> 01:14:03.451]  You can actually read a book called So You've Been Publicly Shamed by John Ronson, which explains this phenomenon.
[01:14:03.451 --> 01:14:09.173]  The people who got fired, who lost their jobs, whose lives completely melted down as a result of being publicly shamed,
[01:14:09.853 --> 01:14:19.845]  Are the ones who apologized, the ones who stood up for their beliefs and basically told everybody, you know, where to get off and said, I'm not going to back down, I'm not going to apologize.
[01:14:19.845 --> 01:14:21.387]  They're the ones who went on to prosper.
[01:14:21.387 --> 01:14:25.631]  They actually had better lives after the whole, you know, fiasco.
[01:14:25.631 --> 01:14:27.093]  So that's the key.
[01:14:27.093 --> 01:14:29.356]  That's the answer to this social outrage phenomenon.
[01:14:29.776 --> 01:14:31.036]  Never back down.
[01:14:31.036 --> 01:14:31.937]  Never apologize.
[01:14:31.937 --> 01:14:32.657]  Right, Anthony?
[01:14:32.657 --> 01:14:34.158]  And if you make a mistake, that's fine.
[01:14:34.158 --> 01:14:35.078]  Just be real.
[01:14:35.078 --> 01:14:37.279]  Don't apologize for being real.
[01:14:37.279 --> 01:14:41.580]  And ultimately, as you were saying, social media can be definitely a tool to inform people and help people.
[01:14:41.580 --> 01:14:43.681]  It's just we're so locked into the Borg system.
[01:14:43.681 --> 01:14:45.081]  We're not judging people for using it.
[01:14:45.081 --> 01:14:54.084]  We're just saying at the same time, though, it, of course, is really a cannibalistic, sick, narcissistic-based system.
[01:14:54.084 --> 01:14:54.985]  Cole in Georgia.
[01:14:54.985 --> 01:14:55.545]  You're on the air.
[01:14:55.545 --> 01:14:56.085]  Go ahead, Cole.
[01:14:58.308 --> 01:14:59.129]  Bob Joseph Watson.
[01:14:59.129 --> 01:15:00.089]  How you doing, man?
[01:15:00.089 --> 01:15:00.489]  Good.
[01:15:00.489 --> 01:15:01.290]  What's your point today?
[01:15:01.290 --> 01:15:08.815]  Uh, I was wanting to talk about how, uh, CIA and, uh, George Bush connection and, uh, drug trafficking connection.
[01:15:08.815 --> 01:15:10.035]  Sure, go ahead.
[01:15:10.035 --> 01:15:16.779]  It's, it's kind of, like, about, uh, say, I think I can't remember how many years ago.
[01:15:16.779 --> 01:15:25.705]  My cousin who's been in the military, he's been with the Marines, he was talking about, he just brought up a point talking about how, he was talking about how,
[01:15:26.701 --> 01:15:31.365]  Oh, George Bush is connected to the CIA and they bring the drugs in.
[01:15:31.365 --> 01:15:33.126]  I'm just like, what?
[01:15:33.126 --> 01:15:34.267]  Where did that come from?
[01:15:34.267 --> 01:15:41.353]  Well, there's actually a new movie out, which you were telling me about, Anthony, about the CIA involvement in the drug trade.
[01:15:41.353 --> 01:15:43.775]  I thought it was a great film.
[01:15:43.775 --> 01:15:52.863]  Essentially, it talks about the CIA smuggling in drugs and their control of the whole system and how the facade is kept over the different agencies that help work towards it.
[01:15:53.323 --> 01:15:58.626]  And it's really quite well done, and I think it's really quite mainstream now that the CIA ships on the drugs.
[01:15:58.626 --> 01:16:05.210]  And I feel like that's not really that much of a debated point besides those who are ignorant to the true information about it.
[01:16:05.210 --> 01:16:12.435]  And if there's a choice between seeing Sicario and The Martian, definitely choose Sicario.
[01:16:12.435 --> 01:16:13.716]  Definitely choose that one.
[01:16:13.716 --> 01:16:17.178]  Okay, Mr. Positive in Tennessee, that's the kind of call we want.
[01:16:17.178 --> 01:16:18.839]  Mr. Positive, you're on the air, go ahead.
[01:16:20.327 --> 01:16:22.969]  Good afternoon, gentlemen, and how are you today?
[01:16:22.969 --> 01:16:25.392]  Good, how's it going?
[01:16:25.392 --> 01:16:26.192]  Doing great.
[01:16:26.192 --> 01:16:34.280]  You guys, I feel privileged to be speaking with you because you're two of my favorite correspondents, although not as easy on the eyes as McAdoo.
[01:16:35.530 --> 01:16:39.051]  Um, and that might be politically incorrect and I... How dare you?
[01:16:39.051 --> 01:16:40.352]  I'm not going to apologize for that.
[01:16:40.352 --> 01:16:45.634]  It's the studio lights are kinder on some people and not so kind on others.
[01:16:45.634 --> 01:16:46.454]  Definitely me.
[01:16:46.454 --> 01:16:47.094]  I'm sure.
[01:16:47.094 --> 01:16:48.555]  I look a lot better on YouTube, okay?
[01:16:48.555 --> 01:16:49.715]  I just want to get that in there.
[01:16:49.715 --> 01:16:51.136]  Go ahead, what's your point?
[01:16:51.136 --> 01:16:55.097]  I don't know about the 10 pounds, but anyway, um, couple of things.
[01:16:55.097 --> 01:17:02.820]  First of all, it strikes me because I have a teenager and I noticed today, obviously having been a teenage boy at one point,
[01:17:03.539 --> 01:17:11.381]  How awkward it is, or was for me, just to talk to a girl in person before texting.
[01:17:11.381 --> 01:17:24.604]  And now, with the texting situation, I'm finding more and more that these teenagers, they have boyfriends and girlfriends that they've never really even verbally spoken with.
[01:17:24.604 --> 01:17:30.986]  And when they never go on a date, they've never been on a date, all they know is texting.
[01:17:32.142 --> 01:17:49.815]  As awkward as it was for me as a teenage boy to speak to a girl, now the teenagers just, it's a barrier that they can't even get through because of this thing that we've been offered and created.
[01:17:49.815 --> 01:17:59.622]  Really, it's horrifying that these kids just, maybe that's a form of population control at some level too.
[01:18:00.814 --> 01:18:07.196]  Really, it's made these kids so socially awkward that it's frightening.
[01:18:07.196 --> 01:18:13.218]  Well, I mean, I've noticed that phenomenon, too, and, you know, you're wasting your time, basically.
[01:18:13.218 --> 01:18:16.499]  Because you know if you resonate with someone only by talking to them.
[01:18:16.499 --> 01:18:21.060]  You can get an inclination through text, sure, but you have to actually talk to them verbally.
[01:18:21.060 --> 01:18:23.961]  There's no way to read what they're saying in the text.
[01:18:23.961 --> 01:18:27.342]  90% of communication is total body language in the way you say something.
[01:18:27.342 --> 01:18:29.403]  It's just like on this radio show, if I were to say,
[01:18:30.143 --> 01:18:34.305]  I love President Obama versus, yeah, I love President Obama.
[01:18:34.305 --> 01:18:36.466]  It's two completely different statements.
[01:18:36.466 --> 01:18:38.687]  You have no idea what you're saying in text a lot of the times.
[01:18:38.687 --> 01:18:43.189]  That's why we had to add emotes and everything like that, instead of actually just communicating with people.
[01:18:43.189 --> 01:18:47.570]  And have you noticed, by the way, when you call someone on the phone, they almost act like, how dare you?
[01:18:49.191 --> 01:18:51.573]  How often do you really talk to people on the phone anymore?
[01:18:51.573 --> 01:18:54.275]  It's all texting, or Facebook Messenger.
[01:18:54.275 --> 01:19:02.421]  And this caller is 100% correct, because the new generation, they don't have to learn how to communicate in the flesh.
[01:19:02.421 --> 01:19:08.745]  They just communicate, and the things they say, by the way, are pretty hardcore in text, because it's almost like a dark void.
[01:19:08.745 --> 01:19:10.467]  It's like it's talking to yourself.
[01:19:10.467 --> 01:19:11.067]  You don't actually talk
[01:19:11.147 --> 01:19:18.734]  There's no real responsibility for what you say, but that also amplifies misunderstandings, because you can't actually communicate yourself properly.
[01:19:18.734 --> 01:19:27.502]  And then when these kids go out into the real world and try to get jobs where they have to physically communicate with people and express themselves, they're completely crippled, right?
[01:19:27.702 --> 01:19:28.462]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:19:28.462 --> 01:19:31.344]  They don't know what to do because they've had no training in that sense.
[01:19:31.344 --> 01:19:42.350]  They've had an online relationship or text-based relationship or whatever and I'm sorry for them because growing up without that capability is really depressing.
[01:19:43.909 --> 01:19:45.372]  Interesting call, Mr. Positive.
[01:19:45.372 --> 01:19:47.194]  We'll explore more of that after the break.
[01:19:47.194 --> 01:19:51.882]  With some more of your calls, also Gadsad coming up in around 10 minutes.

[01:21:59.189 --> 01:22:03.434]  As if chlorine in our water weren't bad enough, now they're adding ammonia?

[01:24:19.500 --> 01:24:19.901]  Yeah.
[01:24:25.583 --> 01:24:30.486]  We're back live on the Alex Jones Show final segment with Anthony Gucciardi.
[01:24:30.486 --> 01:24:38.610]  We've got Gadsad coming up after the break and he's going to really break down the origins of political correctness, the true agenda behind it.
[01:24:38.610 --> 01:24:44.373]  It's not just about being nice to people, being sensitive, making sure you don't offend them.
[01:24:44.373 --> 01:24:50.716]  This is based deeply in political re-education, social engineering.
[01:24:50.716 --> 01:24:52.697]  We're going to delve into it with Gadsad.
[01:24:53.377 --> 01:24:54.538]  At the bottom of the hour.
[01:24:54.538 --> 01:24:57.040]  We're going to go to a couple more of your calls right now.
[01:24:57.040 --> 01:24:58.722]  Let's go to Thomas in Texas.
[01:24:58.722 --> 01:25:00.923]  Positive news coming out of the tyranny.
[01:25:00.923 --> 01:25:01.624]  Thomas, go ahead.
[01:25:01.624 --> 01:25:03.606]  Hey, Paul.
[01:25:03.606 --> 01:25:09.891]  You know, I wanted to make the point about, you know, they're speeding up this tyranny, being more open and blatant about it.
[01:25:09.891 --> 01:25:15.456]  But one thing I noticed was every anniversary of 9-11, I try to talk to people about, one, World Trade Center 7.
[01:25:16.531 --> 01:25:26.195]  And I was surprised by how receptive people were to talking about it this year versus any other, and I was wondering if you guys experienced that same thing.
[01:25:26.195 --> 01:25:36.539]  I haven't really covered 9-11 probably for years now, because, you know, that whole movement kind of devolved into different aspects of the, quote, truth movement.
[01:25:36.539 --> 01:25:38.159]  But what have you found with that, Anthony?
[01:25:38.159 --> 01:25:44.862]  Personally, when I talk to someone about, you know, whatever topic I'm passionate about at the moment, whether it's health or whatever, which I mainly try to focus on,
[01:25:45.422 --> 01:25:49.929]  I find that we are tangibly succeeding in all avenues.
[01:25:49.929 --> 01:26:00.684]  Even if it's just someone who's interested in it and I talk to them about any subject and they look it up and they find out about it, that is 90% of the people that I'm speaking to that are, first of all, interested, right?
[01:26:01.104 --> 01:26:08.951]  So, obviously we have that percentage of the population that doesn't care, that's going to believe whatever Obama says, or whatever Jeb Bush says, or whatever their favorite icon is.
[01:26:08.951 --> 01:26:12.254]  But then, there are those people that really want to know about something.
[01:26:12.254 --> 01:26:17.719]  And some of them already know about it, but the big percentage will say, hey, I haven't heard about that, let me look that up.
[01:26:17.719 --> 01:26:19.461]  And then they find out and they say, wow.
[01:26:19.461 --> 01:26:24.586]  And that ultimately causes kind of a Fisher effect, and they realize all the other stuff that they've been told may not be true as well.
[01:26:25.166 --> 01:26:43.232]  So, I think as things get worse, things get better, in a weird way, because it's so much more apparent as the society gets more and more insane, with people hanging themselves because their phone gets taken away, with laser weaponry being invented, with Hillary Clinton's servers next to a dumpster in a bathroom.
[01:26:43.232 --> 01:26:51.895]  As things get more and more unbelievable, it becomes believable that maybe the establishment isn't on our side, and maybe there is something wrong with this system.
[01:26:52.455 --> 01:26:54.276]  So as it gets worse, it does get better.
[01:26:54.276 --> 01:27:05.183]  So your tagline of positive change coming out of the tyranny, I would agree 100% that positive change is coming out of the tyranny because they're showing their hand and people aren't buying it anymore.
[01:27:05.183 --> 01:27:07.805]  And, you know, people seem to be walking around in a fog.
[01:27:07.805 --> 01:27:10.006]  They know something's not quite right.
[01:27:10.006 --> 01:27:12.507]  There's a huge thirst for alternative information.
[01:27:12.507 --> 01:27:15.890]  That's why we've been successful and that's why we need to fill that gap.
[01:27:15.890 --> 01:27:21.253]  So, yes, I've noticed since, you know, in comparison to 10-15 years ago, people do resonate more
[01:27:21.813 --> 01:27:25.254]  With alternative perspectives on a number of different issues.
[01:27:25.254 --> 01:27:31.395]  So we need to remain positive, simply in our mannerisms in approaching people to talk about these different subjects.
[01:27:31.395 --> 01:27:38.597]  Because, you know, if you approach people and you're all apologetic about what you're about to talk about, you don't have confidence, then instantly they turn off.
[01:27:38.597 --> 01:27:40.838]  Because the establishment heads have confidence.
[01:27:40.838 --> 01:27:41.798]  That's the other thing too.
[01:27:41.798 --> 01:27:42.958]  All the media.
[01:27:42.958 --> 01:27:45.199]  The media, at least they have confidence.
[01:27:45.199 --> 01:27:50.160]  Even though they're deceptive creatures, you know, at least they have confidence they'll sit up here and tell you something.
[01:27:50.720 --> 01:27:51.000]  Right?
[01:27:51.000 --> 01:27:53.042]  That's why people like Trump, he has confidence.
[01:27:53.042 --> 01:27:56.946]  But at the same time, if you go up to someone and you also berate them, they're not going to listen to you.
[01:27:56.946 --> 01:28:01.130]  If you say, you idiot, you don't know about that, you stupid idiot, you can't talk to people like that.
[01:28:01.130 --> 01:28:01.550]  You know?
[01:28:01.550 --> 01:28:03.892]  You have to help them and want to help them.
[01:28:03.892 --> 01:28:05.414]  Ivan in Texas, you're on the air.
[01:28:05.414 --> 01:28:07.796]  Go ahead, Ivan.
[01:28:07.796 --> 01:28:14.442]  Uh, you know, I want to kind of start off by saying, you know, honestly, today society unfortunately has just trained us to the point of saying that, uh,
[01:28:15.313 --> 01:28:23.901]  Cell phones are okay in so many different ways because we communicate in so many different ways, we get all our information in so many different ways, you know, and we have so many different barriers to break down.
[01:28:23.901 --> 01:28:27.024]  I mean, all of it starts with bullying, if you really think about it.
[01:28:27.024 --> 01:28:34.231]  The government's been bullying us all our lives by feeding us information that's just, you know, come on, let's get real, pretty whack.
[01:28:34.231 --> 01:28:38.975]  You know, to say that it's actually even accurate, we know the facts.
[01:28:38.975 --> 01:28:40.437]  I'm pretty sure we know the facts now.
[01:28:41.454 --> 01:28:44.695]  Not only that, I mean, look how to the extent what people have taken it to.
[01:28:44.695 --> 01:28:48.697]  To say that, you know, they're having to be worried about their lives.
[01:28:48.697 --> 01:28:51.958]  And I know this is happening daily because I have friends that have to deal with it daily.
[01:28:51.958 --> 01:28:59.742]  I know to say that they're so bullied and so weak that they don't even have the strength to say that they can have a cell phone in public.
[01:28:59.742 --> 01:29:03.303]  It's always being hidden and just trying to say that, oh, it's okay.
[01:29:03.303 --> 01:29:05.244]  We've been bullied down by the government so bad that
[01:29:06.002 --> 01:29:06.883]  It's time.
[01:29:06.883 --> 01:29:10.385]  We have to get all our facts together to say we stand up.
[01:29:10.385 --> 01:29:12.286]  Well, I think it's fine.
[01:29:12.286 --> 01:29:16.148]  We were talking earlier about how rude it is to use your cell phone in public situations.
[01:29:16.148 --> 01:29:20.972]  It's fine if you're sharing information, like you say, hey, look at this article, look at this YouTube video.
[01:29:20.972 --> 01:29:23.473]  I think that's perfectly acceptable to do that.
[01:29:23.473 --> 01:29:25.855]  So we need to use it at the right moment.
[01:29:25.855 --> 01:29:31.278]  We don't need to use it to ignore our families, ignore our friends, and be locked in our own world.
[01:29:31.278 --> 01:29:33.880]  But it can be used for positive effects.
[01:29:34.600 --> 01:29:36.622]  Presidential debate coming up tonight.
[01:29:36.622 --> 01:29:38.564]  The Democratic presidential debate.
[01:29:38.564 --> 01:29:42.007]  We're going to cover that on the Nightly News with David Knight and Leanne McAdoo.
[01:29:42.007 --> 01:29:44.029]  So be sure to tune in for that.
[01:29:44.029 --> 01:29:45.931]  Gadsad coming up after the break.
[01:29:45.931 --> 01:29:47.373]  This is the Alex Jones Show Live.
[01:29:47.373 --> 01:29:49.094]  Stay tuned.
[01:29:49.094 --> 01:29:50.476]  We're on the march.
[01:29:50.476 --> 01:29:53.018]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:29:53.018 --> 01:29:55.701]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:29:59.855 --> 01:30:05.938]  A paranoid professor quits UT after the university allows concealed carry.
[01:30:05.938 --> 01:30:18.244]  A University of Texas professor is quitting his job and moving from Austin to Australia because of the university's decision to allow students to carry concealed handguns on campus.
[01:30:18.244 --> 01:30:27.329]  Economics professor Daniel Hammermesh is now worried that a disgruntled student might bring a gun into the classroom and start shooting.
[01:30:27.329 --> 01:30:30.971]  The issue is not so much somebody coming into the classroom from the outside.
[01:30:30.971 --> 01:30:39.177]  It's rather a student in the classroom or more likely a student in my office who's upset about a grade and who pulls a gun on me.
[01:30:39.177 --> 01:30:40.198]  I'm not going to carry a gun.
[01:30:40.198 --> 01:30:41.859]  I don't want to be involved in a gun fight.
[01:30:41.859 --> 01:30:50.284]  So apparently, paranoid professor Hammermesh would rather see his students left defenseless and unarmed in the event of an emergency.
[01:30:50.284 --> 01:30:54.387]  Well, Von Boyage professor, take your liberal logic and run.

[01:32:32.490 --> 01:32:37.472]  You probably noticed I've been more focused, less brain fog, more energy, and it's because of BrainForce.
[01:32:37.472 --> 01:32:39.173]  There's always hidden additives in your food.
[01:32:39.173 --> 01:32:40.774]  Even organic food has hidden additives.
[01:32:40.774 --> 01:32:44.256]  Staring at the computer all day, working, doing good, you're still damaging your brain.
[01:32:44.256 --> 01:32:46.237]  Ultimately, we've all been dumbed down to some degree.
[01:32:46.237 --> 01:32:47.157]  It doesn't have stimulants.
[01:32:47.157 --> 01:32:48.358]  It doesn't have garbage in it.
[01:32:48.358 --> 01:32:50.339]  It has natural things that do it clean.

[01:33:17.501 --> 01:33:21.583]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[01:33:21.583 --> 01:33:23.344]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:33:30.714 --> 01:33:46.923]  We're back live on the Alex Jones Show, Tuesday, October 13th edition, and I'm joined by my guest Gad Saad, who is an evolutionary behavioral scientist at the John Molson School of Business, Concordia University in Montreal, Canada.
[01:33:46.923 --> 01:33:52.866]  Now, some of the subjects he's been focusing on recently have kind of intersected with my interests.
[01:33:52.866 --> 01:33:55.748]  He tweeted out one of my videos about feminism,
[01:33:56.528 --> 01:34:06.377]  So we're going to talk about radical feminism, we're going to talk about social justice warriors, and the progressives who have abandoned truly liberal principles.
[01:34:06.377 --> 01:34:08.218]  We're going to cover a raft of issues today.
[01:34:08.218 --> 01:34:14.463]  And it's Gadsad, G-A-D-S-A-A-D, youtube.com slash gadsad.
[01:34:14.463 --> 01:34:16.145]  Gad, welcome to the show.
[01:34:16.145 --> 01:34:17.106]  Good to be with you, Paul.
[01:34:17.884 --> 01:34:26.747]  So let's just start off by explaining some of your background and how it led you to becoming involved in some of the issues that we're going to cover today.
[01:34:26.747 --> 01:34:31.609]  So going back to sort of my childhood background, my ethnic background you mean, or my academic background?
[01:34:31.609 --> 01:34:33.710]  Your academic background.
[01:34:33.710 --> 01:34:41.192]  So I study basically how to apply evolutionary psychology in the context of consumer behavior.
[01:34:41.192 --> 01:34:45.674]  So I look at the biological underpinnings that make us consume the way that we consume.
[01:34:46.610 --> 01:34:53.333]  And an inherent part of being an evolutionary psychologist is to recognize that there are innate realities.
[01:34:53.333 --> 01:34:57.594]  Some of these innate realities manifest themselves in sex differences.
[01:34:57.594 --> 01:35:01.076]  So there are many things that men and women are similar on.
[01:35:01.076 --> 01:35:08.639]  And then there are other things that we should expect a difference if we look at the evolutionary challenges that each sex has had to face.
[01:35:08.639 --> 01:35:13.481]  And so in that context, I have had a chance to interact with a lot of
[01:35:14.961 --> 01:35:31.298]  You know, feminists and social constructivists and postmodernists, a wide range of social scientists and humanities folks who reject some of the ideas of evolutionary psychology precisely because it goes frontally against some of their most cherished beliefs.
[01:35:31.298 --> 01:35:36.743]  And so that's how, if you like, academically, I'm vested in this debate.
[01:35:38.928 --> 01:35:45.033]  So you've committed the thought crime basically of asserting the fact that there are differences between men and women.
[01:35:45.033 --> 01:35:49.337]  You've been attacked for that by feminists, by social justice warriors.
[01:35:49.337 --> 01:35:52.400]  Because now we've got an environment of political correctness.
[01:35:52.400 --> 01:36:05.592]  We've got this censorious environment where if you dare speak out, if you dare challenge the consensus on any of these issues, there's a whole machine of public shaming, of social media shaming that will attack you.
[01:36:06.232 --> 01:36:10.198]  Based on these, you know, politically correct narratives that they have to defend.
[01:36:10.914 --> 01:36:13.935]  Because if they're exposed then it will bring down their entire narrative.
[01:36:13.935 --> 01:36:16.115]  So let's get into political correctness.
[01:36:16.115 --> 01:36:16.435]  Sure.
[01:36:16.435 --> 01:36:19.676]  Which of course has, you know, it's reached insane levels.
[01:36:19.676 --> 01:36:29.017]  We had the University of New Hampshire a couple of months ago saying, you can't use the word American because it might offend people from South America.
[01:36:29.017 --> 01:36:33.598]  You know, they're saying the use of the word mothering or fathering could offend somebody.
[01:36:33.598 --> 01:36:36.118]  We've got trigger warnings at universities.
[01:36:36.118 --> 01:36:39.739]  Just break down, you know, the origins of political correctness.
[01:36:40.339 --> 01:36:43.581]  And the true agenda behind it today?
[01:36:43.581 --> 01:36:50.186]  Well, I mean, I think that the sort of the title of your website, InfoWars, speaks exactly to this issue, right?
[01:36:50.186 --> 01:36:59.012]  I mean, if you wish to win the cultural wars, if you wish to win the battle of ideas, you could either engage people
[01:36:59.944 --> 01:37:08.166]  On equal footing, right, where you each evaluate the merits of the opponent, and then hopefully the best idea wins.
[01:37:08.166 --> 01:37:18.269]  Or, if you don't feel comfortable in so doing, maybe perhaps because you might end up losing the battle of ideas, then you come up with all sorts of mechanisms to shut down debate, right?
[01:37:18.269 --> 01:37:24.251]  So if I am an authoritarian dictator somewhere, I could shut down debate by making it illegal.
[01:37:24.251 --> 01:37:28.072]  I mean, I could kill you if you say something that is contrary to the official doctrine.
[01:37:28.922 --> 01:37:42.632]  In the context of the West, you can't quite behead people, but what you can do is you could behead their reputation, you could behead all sorts of things that are important to them, and that's exactly what happens with political correctness.
[01:37:42.632 --> 01:37:53.199]  It is a means by which people are so afraid to openly speak about positions that they hold, terrorist positions that they hold, that they will self-censor.
[01:37:53.199 --> 01:37:55.781]  And hence, their voices have been beheaded, so to speak.
[01:37:57.182 --> 01:37:58.383]  And that's the key really, isn't it?
[01:37:58.383 --> 01:38:05.227]  I mean, that's why I see, you know, the main force of censorship not coming from the state anymore, it's coming from within the culture.
[01:38:05.227 --> 01:38:22.959]  Because if you create this standard by which people are terrified to even open their mouths in the first place for fear of what might happen, for fear of what their peers might say, you don't even really need the hard core censorship to come in after that, because people won't even utter these kind of statements in the first place.
[01:38:22.959 --> 01:38:25.620]  And that's the essence of political correctness, right?
[01:38:25.620 --> 01:38:25.981]  It's about
[01:38:26.681 --> 01:38:34.864]  Restricting thought, because as you said, these progressives, these social justice warriors, don't believe in equality.
[01:38:34.864 --> 01:38:42.126]  They don't believe in the logic of one argument winning over another on a level playing field, correct?
[01:38:42.126 --> 01:38:52.870]  Absolutely, and you know what is even more disheartening is that this cancer of political correctness is not something that sort of afflicts the average Joe walking in the street, it actually afflicts
[01:38:53.570 --> 01:38:56.332]  The people who should be leading the discourse.
[01:38:56.332 --> 01:38:58.053]  So think about all the intelligentsia.
[01:38:58.053 --> 01:39:01.656]  Think about the people, the professors in the ivory tower, right?
[01:39:01.656 --> 01:39:04.858]  They are the ones who should be leading this exchange.
[01:39:04.858 --> 01:39:09.241]  And oftentimes, I hate to say it, they are some of the most cowardly folks.
[01:39:09.241 --> 01:39:14.225]  They are some of the folks who are most infected with the cancer of political correctness.
[01:39:14.565 --> 01:39:24.534]  Precisely because they belong to a club, let's call it the, historically it was called the progressive club, but now many people are using the term, which I love, the regressive left.
[01:39:25.916 --> 01:39:28.578]  And so they don't want to ever be ostracized from that group.
[01:39:28.578 --> 01:39:40.651]  So even though they might privately write to me or privately when we're having an espresso say, you know what, I frankly support a lot of the things that you say openly, but I don't feel comfortable saying it in public.
[01:39:40.651 --> 01:39:45.016]  They won't like something that I put up on Facebook because even liking it
[01:39:45.416 --> 01:39:47.918]  Might somehow get them feathered and tarred.
[01:39:47.918 --> 01:39:49.279]  So it's really Orwellian.
[01:39:49.279 --> 01:39:59.227]  I mean, it is scary that people are so insecure about their cherished beliefs that they engage in this type of self-censorship.
[01:39:59.227 --> 01:40:13.618]  And as you said, you know, a lot of professors are afraid to make what they fear may be politically incorrect statements because whereas once they embraced classical liberalism, you know, they were tolerant of debate, they were tolerant of a free exchange of ideas.
[01:40:14.460 --> 01:40:21.204]  Now they've been influenced to such an extent by the people who are completely intolerant that they kowtow.
[01:40:21.204 --> 01:40:25.046]  They self-censor their beliefs to appease those people.
[01:40:25.046 --> 01:40:28.909]  There was an interesting interview with Stella Murabito.
[01:40:28.909 --> 01:40:31.670]  She gave an interview to the Daily Caller a couple of days ago.
[01:40:31.670 --> 01:40:36.713]  And this is basically a former intelligence analyst who describes herself as a left-winger.
[01:40:36.713 --> 01:40:43.678]  But she made the point that politically correct thought control and, you know, the elite narratives that are reinforced through it,
[01:40:44.398 --> 01:40:50.907]  They do it, as you just, you know, touched upon then, via social isolation and peer pressure.
[01:40:50.907 --> 01:40:59.579]  It's the threat of what other people, God forbid, might think if you dare express an independent opinion, something mildly controversial.
[01:41:00.385 --> 01:41:10.699]  Which ties into an interesting video that you did, which I saw a couple of days ago, about the Solomon Asch conformity experiment, which we briefly touched upon earlier in the show.
[01:41:10.699 --> 01:41:17.167]  So tell us about this study and what it tells us about how strong a force the desire to conform really is.
[01:41:17.888 --> 01:41:18.128]  Right.
[01:41:18.128 --> 01:41:30.515]  So whenever I teach, you know, my consumer psychology or psychology of decision making, I often will begin by lecturing about some of my favorite psychology experiments of all time.
[01:41:30.515 --> 01:41:37.779]  And usually what they have in common is that they are very, very simple experiments that demonstrate something that is extraordinarily powerful about human nature.
[01:41:37.779 --> 01:41:43.222]  And so in the case of Solomon Asch, this was a social psychologist who in the 50s decided to test
[01:41:44.264 --> 01:41:52.490]  People's proclivity to conform and here to conform to stimuli that are otherwise not very ambiguous, right?
[01:41:52.490 --> 01:41:56.532]  So we're not talking about the real world where everything is gray where it is unclear.
[01:41:56.532 --> 01:41:57.933]  What is the right action to take?
[01:41:57.933 --> 01:41:59.514]  So here's what he basically did.
[01:41:59.514 --> 01:42:05.318]  He brought in a bunch of people and he had one line and then next to it three other lines.
[01:42:05.318 --> 01:42:09.101]  One of those three other lines was the same length as the yeah, great.
[01:42:09.101 --> 01:42:09.821]  I'm glad you're showing it.
[01:42:09.821 --> 01:42:13.584]  So it's clear to anybody who's got, you know, normal vision.
[01:42:14.404 --> 01:42:19.726]  Which of the three lines, A, B, C, should be the one that is the same as the line on the left?
[01:42:19.726 --> 01:42:30.431]  And so what he would do is he'd bring in people and then he'd have a bunch of confederates, meaning these are fake subjects who are not really subjects, they're pretending to be subjects, but there's really only one true subject.
[01:42:30.431 --> 01:42:37.574]  And so he would ask each of those people, please tell us which of the three lines, A, B, and C, are the same as the line on the left.
[01:42:37.574 --> 01:42:43.277]  And each of the confederates, I mean depending on the condition of the experiment, would utter out
[01:42:43.877 --> 01:42:47.120]  You know, in public, openly, the wrong answer.
[01:42:47.120 --> 01:42:57.969]  And so what he was doing there is he's setting up the conditions to see whether the actual participant, who would be the last guy in line, whether he would say, well, what are you talking about?
[01:42:57.969 --> 01:42:59.810]  No, sorry guys, that's the wrong line.
[01:42:59.810 --> 01:43:00.311]  You're wrong.
[01:43:01.031 --> 01:43:02.672]  Or whether he would conform.
[01:43:02.672 --> 01:43:17.603]  And the reality is that a non-trivial number of people, I mean different conditions resulted in different compliance rates, but certainly quite a substantial number of people would go against their eyes and simply conform to group pressures.
[01:43:17.603 --> 01:43:22.886]  Now again, what makes this study so powerful is that this is not an ambiguous stimulus.
[01:43:22.886 --> 01:43:27.670]  It should be clear to any sane person who has, you know, reasonable vision,
[01:43:28.010 --> 01:43:34.909]  What the true answer is, but yet my desire to conform to the group is greater than my lying eyes.
[01:43:34.909 --> 01:43:35.410]  So there you go.
[01:43:36.337 --> 01:43:45.165]  And, you know, as you mentioned, in some cases it was literally 38-39% of people who said what was clearly the wrong answer.
[01:43:45.165 --> 01:44:01.420]  You can see from the example that we just showed on screen, it's obvious which line is the same length as the line on the left, but because seven other people before them had given a different answer, and these were Stooges in this experiment, they chose the same answer simply to conform to the prior pressure
[01:44:02.060 --> 01:44:05.521]  Obviously, knowing that it was the wrong answer.
[01:44:05.521 --> 01:44:08.282]  And we also see this conformity in fashion, correct?
[01:44:08.282 --> 01:44:10.722]  Because we follow the herd.
[01:44:10.722 --> 01:44:13.783]  Again, I was buying, I was trying to buy jeans a few weeks ago.
[01:44:13.783 --> 01:44:16.304]  I was on a website, a clothing website.
[01:44:16.304 --> 01:44:21.965]  Now we know that, you know, a lot of fashion designers are homosexuals, they're gay men.
[01:44:21.965 --> 01:44:24.926]  Fair enough, as long as the clothes look good, I don't care.
[01:44:24.926 --> 01:44:27.147]  But literally every single pair of jeans
[01:44:27.887 --> 01:44:29.227]  Was rolled up.
[01:44:29.227 --> 01:44:30.408]  With no socks.
[01:44:30.408 --> 01:44:37.930]  So I was like, I don't wear jeans without socks, I don't wear jeans that are rolled up, so I can't see what they look like with shoes on.
[01:44:37.930 --> 01:44:43.172]  Literally every pair of jeans on the website was like this, because that's the fashion.
[01:44:43.172 --> 01:44:49.654]  And if you don't conform to that, then, you know, you're gonna have problems, you're gonna get socially isolated in some circumstances.
[01:44:49.654 --> 01:44:52.795]  So, this conformity also applies to fashion, correct?
[01:44:53.709 --> 01:45:03.142]  Yeah, that's a perfect point because I actually use this exact example in my books where I argue that fashion is nothing but a big conformity experiment.
[01:45:03.142 --> 01:45:09.151]  Either you've independently thought of this or you've been reading my books because that's exactly what it is, right?
[01:45:09.451 --> 01:45:14.393]  You create a queue of, in French we say, appartenance, or belongingness, right?
[01:45:14.393 --> 01:45:19.595]  Today, to be part of the in-fashion group, you have to wear brown.
[01:45:19.595 --> 01:45:20.075]  That's it.
[01:45:20.075 --> 01:45:23.096]  There's some dictum that says that brown is in.
[01:45:23.096 --> 01:45:25.097]  Well, we all rush and buy brown.
[01:45:25.097 --> 01:45:28.098]  Well, next season, brown is the evil color.
[01:45:28.098 --> 01:45:29.178]  It's now green.
[01:45:29.178 --> 01:45:31.999]  Well, we all drop our evil brown and we rush to buy green.
[01:45:31.999 --> 01:45:34.100]  So it is exactly catering to
[01:45:34.960 --> 01:45:35.981]  Yeah, sure, yeah.
[01:45:51.536 --> 01:46:04.126]  Well, I mean, I would not be engaging in hyperbole if I were to tell you that probably 50% of the female students in my, at least undergraduate classes, were wearing UGG boots.
[01:46:04.126 --> 01:46:10.831]  So much so that you would almost think that my university had that as part of its dress code.
[01:46:10.831 --> 01:46:15.375]  Like you had to wear UGG boots, otherwise somehow you wouldn't be allowed entrance
[01:46:16.155 --> 01:46:19.961]  And of course now, I don't see them wearing Ugg boots.
[01:46:19.961 --> 01:46:29.415]  So this need to conform manifests itself in endless ways and regrettably, in the context of political correctness, it manifests itself in these insidious ways.
[01:46:30.694 --> 01:46:32.094]  We're talking to Gadsad.
[01:46:32.094 --> 01:46:37.656]  His YouTube channel is youtube.com forward slash Gadsad twitter at Gadsad.
[01:46:37.656 --> 01:46:39.697]  Go and check out some of his videos.
[01:46:39.697 --> 01:46:41.497]  Excellent content.
[01:46:41.497 --> 01:46:46.739]  Let's go to feminism now because of course you shared one or two of my videos on feminism.
[01:46:47.319 --> 01:46:56.424]  And you touched upon it on the intro there, you know, modern feminists are loath to acknowledge the fact that there are these fundamental differences between men and women.
[01:46:56.424 --> 01:47:03.187]  It's not enough to say that men and women are better suited to different tasks, but still equal.
[01:47:03.187 --> 01:47:04.488]  That's not good enough.
[01:47:04.488 --> 01:47:07.690]  So, from your background in evolutionary psychology,
[01:47:08.570 --> 01:47:15.757]  Why is there this drive to homogenize the sexes and why is it so fundamentally unscientific?
[01:47:15.757 --> 01:47:20.461]  Well, I think it starts, if I'm going to be charitable towards them, I would say the following.
[01:47:20.461 --> 01:47:27.547]  It starts from the laudable goal of trying to eradicate institutionalized sexism.
[01:47:27.547 --> 01:47:32.592]  Now, we can all agree that if feminism is about making sure that men and women are equal,
[01:47:33.152 --> 01:47:40.376]  In all of the various ways, politically, economically, socially, then of course we can all buy into that grand objective.
[01:47:40.376 --> 01:47:42.277]  Now, here's where they make the mistake.
[01:47:42.277 --> 01:47:54.965]  They think that in the pursuit of equality, it is easier to have a narrative that says that the two sexes are fundamentally indistinguishable from one another.
[01:47:54.965 --> 01:48:00.468]  Because that simply doesn't allow any sexism to seep into the narrative.
[01:48:00.968 --> 01:48:12.713]  If you concede that men and women are very similar in some ways and very different in others, this lends a weaponry, if you'd like, for sexism to be maintained.
[01:48:12.713 --> 01:48:24.038]  And so they start off with a laudable premise, and they of course wrongly think that by arguing that the two sexes are biologically distinguishable, this means that sexism will always exist.
[01:48:24.178 --> 01:48:25.340]  Which is of course nonsense.
[01:48:25.340 --> 01:48:34.754]  So if I'm going to be charitable, I would say that that's where their fundamental original error stems from.
[01:48:34.754 --> 01:48:38.640]  And this idea that there are no differences, or that there are minimal differences,
[01:48:39.807 --> 01:48:44.391]  It doesn't conform to reality, which is that we live in a meritocracy.
[01:48:44.391 --> 01:48:51.458]  If your skills are higher than somebody else's, if you're better at a certain task, you should be given the opportunity over them.
[01:48:51.458 --> 01:48:52.839]  That's not what they want.
[01:48:52.839 --> 01:48:57.544]  They want the oppression Olympics, where, you know, gender or race or whatever issue
[01:48:58.104 --> 01:49:11.992]  is held to a higher standard than actual skill and talent, which of course is disastrous for a society that's trying to develop and improve because you want the cream to rise to the top, you want the best people in the best positions, correct?
[01:49:12.793 --> 01:49:21.617]  Yes, and I would say that that particular mindset actually comes from the tabula rasa premise of the human mind, right?
[01:49:21.617 --> 01:49:32.283]  The idea that we are all born with empty minds, without any biological innate imperatives, and that what makes us who we become is strictly our environment, strictly socialization.
[01:49:34.585 --> 01:49:48.020]  So, to recognize that there are starting points, that there are biological imperatives that make men and women on some issues fundamentally different from one another violates this tabula rasa premise, right?
[01:49:48.260 --> 01:49:58.032]  I mean, it could be taken to such ludicrous heights that the idea, for example, that Lionel Messi might have an innate talent that he started off with.
[01:49:58.032 --> 01:50:06.762]  In other words, Lionel Messi, it didn't matter what environment he had, would always end up being a greater soccer player than Paul Joseph Watson.
[01:50:07.503 --> 01:50:09.204]  They would reject that.
[01:50:09.204 --> 01:50:24.452]  They would say that there is a unique confluence of environmental factors that created Lionel Messi, but there is nothing inherent in his starting point that would have made Lionel Messi any better than Paul Joseph Watson.
[01:50:24.452 --> 01:50:33.397]  And so again, it comes from the idea that we all have equal potentiality, we all could be anything, and that's simply not true.
[01:50:34.588 --> 01:50:37.230]  We'll be back with Gad Saad after the break.
[01:50:37.230 --> 01:50:42.954]  We're going to talk about social media and mob outrage, along with a raft of other issues.
[01:50:42.954 --> 01:50:49.498]  Again, tonight, InfoWars Nightly News are going to be covering the Democratic debates, live coverage with Leanne McAdoo and David Knight.
[01:50:49.498 --> 01:50:52.460]  InfoWars.com for all the breaking news.
[01:50:52.460 --> 01:50:55.262]  Stay tuned, we're going to be coming back with Gad Saad.
[01:50:55.262 --> 01:50:55.863]  Keep it locked in.
[01:50:59.875 --> 01:51:03.839]  You wouldn't go camping in the Everglades without bug spray, would you?
[01:51:03.839 --> 01:51:08.864]  It's in our nature to protect ourselves, especially when protection is simple and affordable.
[01:51:08.864 --> 01:51:14.711]  That's why IDStronghold.com has been providing affordable RFID protection for over 10 years.
[01:51:15.371 --> 01:51:24.875]  ID Stronghold wallets protect you from electronic pickpockets who pass near you with scanners and steal the information on the RFID chips in your credit and debit cards.
[01:51:24.875 --> 01:51:31.437]  IDStronghold.com is a technology company, so we understand how to best protect you against intrusive radio waves.
[01:51:31.977 --> 01:51:39.260]  ID Stronghold wallets are designed to block RFID signals, opened or closed, no matter where in the wallet you put your cards.
[01:51:39.260 --> 01:51:45.923]  Most other RFID wallets on the market were designed with only fashion in mind and do not shield properly, if at all.
[01:51:45.923 --> 01:51:52.346]  When you're shopping for your next wallet, be sure to get the protection you deserve by going to idstronghold.com.
[01:51:52.346 --> 01:51:56.588]  Because getting anything else is like using latex gloves as oven mitts.
[01:51:58.485 --> 01:51:58.705]  Ouch!
[01:52:19.813 --> 01:52:27.620]  LiverShield is the only liver support product on the market that uses a patented Spigyrex blend of powerful organic herbs that support detoxification.
[01:52:27.620 --> 01:52:33.046]  And when you visit InfoWarsLife.com, see the instructional video on how to do a six-day liver detox.
[01:52:33.046 --> 01:52:36.749]  This isn't a game, and let me tell you, the results are dramatic.
[01:52:36.749 --> 01:52:40.893]  LiverShield is totally organic and made of the safest, high-quality herbs.
[01:52:40.893 --> 01:52:44.757]  But that said, you need to consult your physician before you do the full detox.
[01:52:45.177 --> 01:52:49.299]  Liver Shield can also be used daily by itself for overall upkeep of the liver.

[01:53:01.685 --> 01:53:03.446]  Does your water contain chlorine or fluoride?
[01:53:03.446 --> 01:53:05.387]  Will you have drinkable water in an emergency?

[01:54:51.962 --> 01:54:53.263]  Knockout.
[01:54:53.263 --> 01:54:55.004]  A number of great supplements.
[01:54:55.004 --> 01:54:56.786]  Advanced Liver Cleanse Pack.
[01:54:56.786 --> 01:54:58.567]  Excellent third-party reviews there.
[01:54:58.567 --> 01:55:01.089]  You can go and check out all these different products.
[01:55:01.089 --> 01:55:02.651]  Infowarsstore.com.
[01:55:03.783 --> 01:55:08.968]  We're talking to Professor Gad Saad, whose YouTube channel is youtube.com forward slash Gad Saad.
[01:55:08.968 --> 01:55:13.914]  Be sure to check out his excellent videos, which I discovered just recently.
[01:55:13.914 --> 01:55:26.086]  Feminism, we touched upon it before the break, in terms of, you know, how it's fundamentally unscientific to not recognize the basic differences between men and women, which is what radical feminism intends to do.
[01:55:26.847 --> 01:55:28.629]  Because it's all about a power grab.
[01:55:28.629 --> 01:55:30.632]  It's not about true equality.
[01:55:30.632 --> 01:55:33.275]  They don't recognize true equality.
[01:55:33.275 --> 01:55:43.688]  They only want to exploit this to create division so they can come in and fill the vacuum and basically play, you know, the oppression Olympics where one gender is raised above another.
[01:55:44.585 --> 01:55:56.316]  And society isn't based on meritocracy, which it should be, to create and build a successful society with both men and women contributing in terms of what they're good at.
[01:55:56.316 --> 01:56:00.821]  But let's move on to, you know, just the word itself.
[01:56:00.821 --> 01:56:04.404]  The modern incarnation of feminism, and I've made numerous videos about this,
[01:56:05.285 --> 01:56:10.289]  Has become so unpopular that it's basically turned feminism into a dirty word.
[01:56:10.289 --> 01:56:20.836]  We've got polls now with less than 25% of American women identifying as feminist and I think even the more recent polls show that it's less than that.
[01:56:20.836 --> 01:56:30.464]  So Gadsad, why does the establishment media, again mainly through the entertainment industry, still insist on promoting and venerating
[01:56:31.224 --> 01:56:43.537]  What is obviously a discredited and in many ways harmful belief system, why do they insist on pushing this radical feminism bent when less and less people are resonating with it?
[01:56:44.631 --> 01:56:55.234]  I'm guessing because they, in a sense, exist within their echo chamber where they don't necessarily receive feedback that the message is not resonating, right?
[01:56:55.234 --> 01:57:01.256]  Because the people that they get together with to sip their fancy lattes are in full agreement with their positions.
[01:57:01.256 --> 01:57:02.297]  This is kind of like when
[01:57:03.317 --> 01:57:10.044]  A professor overestimates his ability in terms of how well he'll do in his teaching at the end of the semester.
[01:57:10.044 --> 01:57:11.986]  Why does he or she overestimate it?
[01:57:11.986 --> 01:57:19.213]  It's because he's only receiving feedback from students who come up to him to say, hey professor, loved your term, right?
[01:57:19.213 --> 01:57:26.981]  But the people who thought that he was really poor didn't take the time to come up to him and say, hey professor, I really thought you sucked and that this was the worst class.
[01:57:27.361 --> 01:57:34.926]  And therefore he walks into the teaching evaluation thinking that he is actually going to perform better than he truly will perform.
[01:57:34.926 --> 01:57:37.608]  And the same thing is happening with traditional media, right?
[01:57:37.608 --> 01:57:45.174]  They're not necessarily in touch with the general landscape and the mood of the general populace.
[01:57:45.174 --> 01:57:53.660]  And I think whether it be your media outlet or other independent media outlets, I think they are correcting for that problem because they're offering voices
[01:57:54.945 --> 01:58:03.613]  To folks who otherwise would have never gotten a foot in the door if it were the traditional media that were still, you know, monopolizing all the voices.
[01:58:03.613 --> 01:58:06.296]  So thank you for your show and for other people like you.
[01:58:06.940 --> 01:58:08.260]  Why, I appreciate it.
[01:58:08.260 --> 01:58:09.481]  That's exactly what it is.
[01:58:09.481 --> 01:58:10.461]  It's an echo chamber.
[01:58:10.461 --> 01:58:13.582]  And feminists themselves, they refuse to be challenged.
[01:58:13.582 --> 01:58:17.783]  That's why they never, you know, temper or adjust these radical belief systems.
[01:58:17.783 --> 01:58:20.264]  They've got these block lists on Twitter.
[01:58:20.264 --> 01:58:24.165]  They refuse to even engage in any kind of conversation, any debate.
[01:58:24.165 --> 01:58:26.545]  You know, you've got trigger warnings, safe spaces.
[01:58:26.545 --> 01:58:27.526]  They hate free speech.
[01:58:27.526 --> 01:58:28.746]  They hate debate.
[01:58:28.746 --> 01:58:30.967]  We're going to talk more about it after the break.
[01:58:30.967 --> 01:58:35.068]  With Gadsad, this is the Alex Jones Show live in 4Wars.com.
[01:58:35.068 --> 01:58:35.568]  Stay tuned.

[02:00:05.646 --> 02:00:10.470]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[02:00:10.470 --> 02:00:12.071]  You want answers?
[02:00:12.071 --> 02:00:13.612]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:13.612 --> 02:00:17.796]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:17.796 --> 02:00:21.859]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:29.509 --> 02:00:33.252]  Final hour of the Alex Jones Show with me, your host, Paul Joseph Watson.
[02:00:33.252 --> 02:00:37.456]  We're going to go to your calls after our guest gets off here at the bottom of the hour.
[02:00:37.456 --> 02:00:46.484]  But we're talking to Gad Saad, who is a behavioural scientist about feminism, about social justice warriors, about the threat to free speech.
[02:00:46.484 --> 02:00:54.571]  And now I want to switch to social media and mob outrage, which of course is becoming an increasingly potent force.
[02:00:55.757 --> 02:00:56.798]  Social media outrage.
[02:00:56.798 --> 02:01:01.501]  Basically, people being publicly shamed, fired from their jobs.
[02:01:01.501 --> 02:01:10.146]  We saw it a few weeks ago with the lawyer who had the temerity to call a female's LinkedIn picture stunning, God forbid.
[02:01:10.146 --> 02:01:11.787]  He was fired, he was publicly shamed.
[02:01:11.787 --> 02:01:19.512]  And again, in some cases, people being physically hounded for their politically incorrect free speech.
[02:01:19.512 --> 02:01:23.035]  But there's something of a backlash brewing against this phenomenon.
[02:01:24.150 --> 02:01:41.167]  And Gadsad, would you agree that, you know, as I mentioned earlier, the biggest threat to free speech is now not necessarily the state, it's these hate mobs on Twitter, on Facebook, who have basically accumulated this power simply from being perpetually offended.
[02:01:41.167 --> 02:01:46.153]  They amplify each other's offense, even though it's completely baseless in most cases.
[02:01:46.733 --> 02:01:58.320]  Now they've accumulated this power of public shaming, which in many cases is more powerful than the state when they try to crush free speech via direct censorship.
[02:01:59.241 --> 02:01:59.721]  Absolutely.
[02:01:59.721 --> 02:02:04.243]  Look, let me give you a few personal anecdotes.
[02:02:04.243 --> 02:02:09.704]  I often ask some of my colleagues who should be at the forefront of engaging the public, right?
[02:02:09.704 --> 02:02:20.108]  I mean, as academics and as scientists, I mean, yes, sure, we could work within our areas of expertise, but some of us have, you know, opinions to share about all sorts of issues.
[02:02:20.108 --> 02:02:20.408]  We should
[02:02:21.188 --> 02:02:22.349]  I'm afraid.
[02:02:40.882 --> 02:02:44.225]  Because of some of the dynamics that you mentioned at the start of your question, right?
[02:02:44.225 --> 02:02:49.930]  I mean, I don't want to expose myself to these ravenous mobs.
[02:02:49.930 --> 02:02:54.494]  I don't want to perhaps say something once that might be misconstrued.
[02:02:54.494 --> 02:02:55.435]  I'll give you an example.
[02:02:56.155 --> 02:03:02.605]  A colleague of mine once tweeted, he was trying to make a quip.
[02:03:02.605 --> 02:03:11.638]  Maybe it was a silly one, but he said something to the effect, and I'm going to paraphrase, you know overweight people, if you don't have the willpower to resist the next
[02:03:12.339 --> 02:03:12.759]  I think?
[02:03:42.265 --> 02:03:43.947]  Well-respected scientist.
[02:03:43.947 --> 02:03:44.987]  I know him personally.
[02:03:44.987 --> 02:03:46.629]  I know his character.
[02:03:46.629 --> 02:03:52.574]  You know, he tried his luck at a joke that was probably idiotic and it failed.
[02:03:52.574 --> 02:04:03.704]  Now, to imagine that people could be so diabolically nasty that that mistake that he made should end his career and that they would call for that
[02:04:04.304 --> 02:04:13.829]  It's simply breathtaking and so in most cases people don't want to join the discussion because they're afraid of repercussions and hence we have self-censorship again.
[02:04:15.549 --> 02:04:17.990]  And again, you mentioned the fat-shaming angle there.
[02:04:17.990 --> 02:04:19.571]  I've made videos about that.
[02:04:19.571 --> 02:04:33.840]  There was actually a TV show recently, like a sitcom, and one of the skits, which was like a promotional thing for the 30-minute TV show, was basically a fat guy, very fat guy, obese, sat in a doctor's office saying, you know, Doctor, what's wrong with me?
[02:04:33.840 --> 02:04:36.721]  And the doctor says, well, you're fat, that's what's wrong with you.
[02:04:36.721 --> 02:04:38.983]  They called for the show to be banned.
[02:04:38.983 --> 02:04:44.486]  That's the level it's got to, where humour, and Jerry Seinfeld, a bunch of other people have complained about this, where humour is now
[02:04:45.146 --> 02:04:46.889]  You know, not to be tolerated whatsoever.
[02:04:46.889 --> 02:04:49.492]  We're going to come back with Gadsad after the break.
[02:04:49.492 --> 02:04:52.797]  We're going to talk about social media and mob outrage.
[02:04:52.797 --> 02:04:56.022]  This is the Alex Jones Show live, InfoWars.com.
[02:04:56.022 --> 02:04:56.583]  Stay right there.
[02:04:59.625 --> 02:05:07.310]  Joe Biggs here with InfoWars.com, Black Lives Matter movement going global to combat gun-toting white racists.
[02:05:07.310 --> 02:05:10.812]  That's right, if you're white and you carry a gun, you're a racist!
[02:05:10.812 --> 02:05:14.694]  Welcome to the brand new America, brought to you by Barack Obama.
[02:05:14.694 --> 02:05:24.900]  Article up at InfoWars.com, Breitbart's Big Journalism covered a weekend event hosted by MSNBC's Touré in Los Angeles that featured several Black Lives Matter leaders.
[02:05:25.100 --> 02:05:35.144]  The panelists convened on this first annual Politicon to discuss how the movement is going global and carrying its message of antipathy against white racism around the world.
[02:05:35.144 --> 02:05:39.306]  Is Barack Obama actually trying to start World War III?
[02:05:39.306 --> 02:05:41.907]  Article up at InfoWars.com.
[02:05:41.907 --> 02:05:50.870]  Why has Barack Obama airdropped 50 tons of ammunition into areas that moderate rebels in Syria supposedly control?
[02:05:50.870 --> 02:05:54.692]  This is essentially the equivalent of poking the Russians directly in the eyes.
[02:05:54.912 --> 02:05:59.416]  You can find more reports like this at InfoWars.com.
[02:05:59.416 --> 02:06:09.143]  Most of the InfoWars radio listening audience is aware of the high-quality, affordable firearms available that are made right here in America at HDFirearms.com.
[02:06:09.143 --> 02:06:15.668]  One of the most exciting things about HDFirearms.com is the ability to upgrade your AR-15 platform today.

[02:06:22.572 --> 02:06:25.353]  6061 Billet Material with Type 3 Hard Coating.
[02:06:25.353 --> 02:06:28.974]  Bolt Carrier Group for .308 and .556 ARs.

[02:06:59.167 --> 02:07:04.931]  Your liver can be full of fatty deposits, built-up toxins, and even dangerous objects known as liver stones.
[02:07:04.931 --> 02:07:10.754]  We worked with the top developers in the field of detox to take tried and true herbs and other compounds.
[02:07:10.794 --> 02:07:11.315]  I think so.
[02:07:33.177 --> 02:07:36.740]  This isn't a game, and let me tell you, the results are dramatic.
[02:07:36.740 --> 02:07:40.884]  LiverShield is totally organic and made of the safest, high-quality herbs.
[02:07:40.884 --> 02:07:45.208]  But that said, you need to consult your physician before you do the full detox.
[02:07:45.208 --> 02:07:49.332]  LiverShield can also be used daily by itself for overall upkeep of the liver.

[02:08:16.977 --> 02:08:21.626]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[02:08:33.303 --> 02:08:36.464]  It's Paul Joseph Watson back live with the Alex Jones Show.
[02:08:36.464 --> 02:08:41.786]  We've got Gad Saad on the line for another 20-25 minutes or so.
[02:08:41.786 --> 02:08:43.847]  Top story on Infowars.com.
[02:08:43.847 --> 02:08:46.067]  This is also linked on the Drudge Report.
[02:08:46.067 --> 02:08:47.088]  Obama!
[02:08:47.088 --> 02:08:51.189]  American suspicion of government is paralyzing.
[02:08:51.189 --> 02:08:59.092]  In a somewhat under-the-radar interview, the President made some candid comments that reveal more than usual regarding his end-of-office agenda.
[02:08:59.753 --> 02:09:05.636]  Noting that he finds Americans common skepticism of government paralyzing.
[02:09:05.636 --> 02:09:16.100]  Which is interesting given our topic of conversation, political correctness, which of course was started by the Frankfurt School, that's how it was imported into America.
[02:09:16.100 --> 02:09:24.224]  It was embraced by the Soviets, it was embraced by Maoist China, who of course defined a politically incorrect opinion
[02:09:24.804 --> 02:09:27.667]  As one that disagreed with the state.
[02:09:27.667 --> 02:09:33.792]  Again, illustrating the fact that this is a top-down tool of censorship and oppression.
[02:09:33.792 --> 02:09:38.797]  This isn't a grassroots, bottom-up movement for people to be kinder to each other.
[02:09:38.797 --> 02:09:40.458]  It's nothing to do with that.
[02:09:40.458 --> 02:09:41.959]  This is a threat to free speech.
[02:09:41.959 --> 02:09:43.661]  It's a threat to open debate.
[02:09:43.661 --> 02:09:46.023]  It's infected our universities.
[02:09:46.023 --> 02:09:47.204]  And it needs to be addressed.
[02:09:47.204 --> 02:09:48.605]  And there is a backlash against it.
[02:09:49.443 --> 02:09:58.214]  In fact, if you read Jon Ronson's book, So You've Been Publicly Shamed, he kind of underscores the point that you don't apologize to these people.
[02:09:58.214 --> 02:09:59.716]  That's the only way you win.
[02:09:59.716 --> 02:10:01.958]  That's the only way you come out on top.
[02:10:01.958 --> 02:10:05.142]  It's the only way you don't get fired from your job publicly shamed.
[02:10:05.959 --> 02:10:11.440]  By not apologizing, by not backing down, because these outrage mobs are paper tigers.
[02:10:11.440 --> 02:10:17.682]  When you actually challenge them and stand up to them, they disappear, they completely evaporate.
[02:10:17.682 --> 02:10:26.563]  But we're talking to Gadsad about this, and it's youtube.com slash Gadsad, or he's on Twitter at Gadsad, again, G-A-D-S-A-D.
[02:10:26.563 --> 02:10:28.824]  You can find out more of his content there.
[02:10:29.790 --> 02:10:31.812]  But again, social media.
[02:10:31.812 --> 02:10:39.720]  A lot of this social justice warrior mob outrage is driven by what's become to be known as virtue signalling.
[02:10:39.720 --> 02:10:48.729]  And that means basically hashtag activism and people espousing politically correct beliefs simply to make themselves look good.
[02:10:48.729 --> 02:10:53.474]  Simply to earn social brownie points with the rest of their progressive friends.
[02:10:53.954 --> 02:11:05.477]  Whether they even believe in those opinions or not, or whether they're just being lazy, you know, for example, sharing the Kony 2012 video before even watching it or knowing what it was about.
[02:11:05.477 --> 02:11:15.820]  So, Gadsad, from a behavioural and psychological perspective, why is virtue signalling such a compelling temptation for people to engage in?
[02:11:15.820 --> 02:11:17.541]  Why has it become so pervasive?
[02:11:18.308 --> 02:11:22.649]  Well, so that's a great question because I actually discussed this in several of my books.
[02:11:22.649 --> 02:11:27.771]  So let's, before I address that specific question, let's talk about, for example, conspicuous consumption.
[02:11:27.771 --> 02:11:33.593]  Like the idea, for example, that, you know, why is it that 99% of Ferrari owners tend to be men?
[02:11:34.173 --> 02:11:36.355]  Well, it's because it's a form of peacocking, right?
[02:11:36.355 --> 02:11:41.999]  In the same way that the peacock uses his tail to send certain signals about his phenotypic quality, right?
[02:11:41.999 --> 02:11:46.142]  How good his genes are, because they are honest signals of his fitness.
[02:11:46.142 --> 02:11:57.590]  Humans engage in all sorts of signaling, men and women, but contrary to what feminists tell us, men and women use different sex-specific signals to typically impress one another.
[02:11:57.990 --> 02:12:10.696]  Well, in the case of virtue signaling, I am signaling not necessarily my wealth or my beauty, but I'm signaling certain attributes that I think that my social network is going to find desirable.
[02:12:10.696 --> 02:12:18.639]  And so in the case of hashtag activism, I'm basically demonstrating that I care about the world, that I care about something beyond myself.
[02:12:18.639 --> 02:12:19.720]  I'm not narcissistic.
[02:12:20.060 --> 02:12:27.206]  But of course it's hypocritical because the same people who do the hashtag stuff won't take on the really serious issues.
[02:12:27.206 --> 02:12:35.813]  They don't really speak about female genital mutilation or throwing acid on women's faces or child brides or honor killings.
[02:12:35.813 --> 02:12:40.957]  That would be scary, you see, because there could be repercussions from the people that you're criticizing.
[02:12:41.337 --> 02:13:05.825]  But to go after the poor, inane, somewhat castrated, sorry to say it this way, shirtgate guy, because he wore a shirt that seemed to have some offensive images on them, even though those images were drawn by a woman, well, that actually can still show that I am engaged socially, that I could be outraged by the patriarchy, and there won't be any backlash against me.
[02:13:05.825 --> 02:13:10.267]  So I could show that I am serious and engaged and not lose
[02:13:11.283 --> 02:13:14.466]  But not risk the fact of losing my head.
[02:13:14.466 --> 02:13:15.147]  Perfect.
[02:13:15.147 --> 02:13:16.328]  Let's do some virtue signaling.
[02:13:28.237 --> 02:13:34.419]  With this whole migrant crisis, this has given people the opportunity to virtue signal to an unbelievable level.
[02:13:34.419 --> 02:13:40.902]  Basically, they've got a five-bedroom house and, you know, given London housing standards, it's not a big house.
[02:13:40.902 --> 02:13:42.802]  The bedrooms are tiny.
[02:13:42.802 --> 02:13:52.246]  He actually wanted to take in two immigrant families to live in these two office bedrooms, which were basically, you know, tiny.
[02:13:52.246 --> 02:13:53.506]  They couldn't have housed a family.
[02:13:53.506 --> 02:13:55.707]  They could barely house one person in there.
[02:13:55.707 --> 02:13:57.428]  So again, merely making this
[02:13:58.248 --> 02:14:08.095]  This observation, this advocacy for virtue signaling, with no intention whatsoever of following through on it, simply to earn these social brownie points, that's what it's all about.
[02:14:08.095 --> 02:14:20.565]  But I want to say... There's a paper by a colleague, some marketing colleagues, I don't remember the exact title of the paper, but they say, I mean, speaking of virtue signaling, they say, going green to be seen, right?
[02:14:20.565 --> 02:14:24.728]  So instead of using, let's say, a Ferrari to impress, you get that Prius,
[02:14:25.228 --> 02:14:30.870]  Boy, it shows that you are green and you are serious and you can hug trees and so on.
[02:14:30.870 --> 02:14:36.392]  Yeah, and again, you find often in these people's personal lives, they're not following through on any of this.
[02:14:36.392 --> 02:14:37.972]  They're not really green people.
[02:14:37.972 --> 02:14:38.932]  They don't really give a damn.
[02:14:38.932 --> 02:14:42.734]  They just want the perception that they are to get the social brownie points.
[02:14:42.734 --> 02:14:46.335]  But again, staying on social media, I just want to move on to this.
[02:14:47.520 --> 02:14:55.548]  You know, these studies have shown that social media is making people more depressed, despite the virtue signaling, despite the social brownie points.
[02:14:55.548 --> 02:15:00.492]  We've got an article here from The Atlantic, and we touched upon this with Anthony Gucciardi earlier.
[02:15:00.492 --> 02:15:02.774]  The flight from conversation.
[02:15:02.774 --> 02:15:12.584]  The psychologist Sherry Turkle argues that replacing face-to-face communication with smartphones is diminishing people's capacity for empathy.
[02:15:13.274 --> 02:15:24.302]  We also have the studies showing that, you know, Facebook makes people depressed because it creates this false impression that everybody else's life is so dynamic and so interesting, theirs isn't.
[02:15:24.302 --> 02:15:26.904]  Then we've got the interaction with this article.
[02:15:28.032 --> 02:15:36.838]  Which of course is a, you know, in the real world social interaction is a crucial element of maintaining emotional stability and happiness.
[02:15:36.838 --> 02:15:39.960]  But in terms of the cyber world it seems to have the opposite effect.
[02:15:39.960 --> 02:15:46.044]  It only seems to make people more alienated when they're using these supposed social networks.
[02:15:46.044 --> 02:15:51.147]  It only seems to be making them more disconnected from other people and more unhappy.
[02:15:51.147 --> 02:15:57.392]  So why is this happening and, you know, what impact is this growing obsession with narcissism, which I think you've also talked about,
[02:15:58.132 --> 02:16:04.839]  Having, you know, on just the way that humans behave, how they interact with each other and how their brains are wired.
[02:16:04.839 --> 02:16:16.131]  Well, there's a great study that I think was conducted, a longitudinal study over 70 years, I might get some of the details wrong, where they sort of looked at longitudinally what ultimately makes people happy.
[02:16:16.571 --> 02:16:29.855]  And I think the leader of that project sort of summarized it by simply saying something to the effect of, you know, just have meaningful relationships with people that love you and you love them back or something to that effect.
[02:16:29.855 --> 02:16:32.076]  We are a social species, right?
[02:16:32.076 --> 02:16:39.418]  One of the reasons why placing somebody in solitary confinement can be considered cruel and unusual punishment
[02:16:39.998 --> 02:16:46.620]  Even though putting them out in general public might expose them to being knifed and shanked and killed and raped.
[02:16:46.620 --> 02:16:58.162]  Well, people are willing to take that risk because ultimately to put me alone is maybe a greater punishment than me having to face an onslaught of aggressive folks.
[02:16:58.162 --> 02:17:00.503]  At least I am amongst others.
[02:17:00.503 --> 02:17:04.003]  And so I think what social media does, to some extent it is good.
[02:17:04.003 --> 02:17:07.164]  It allows me to reconnect with people that I might not
[02:17:07.264 --> 02:17:10.406]  Not I've seen since my childhood in Lebanon.
[02:17:10.406 --> 02:17:14.069]  But on the other hand, once taken to an extreme, it is very isolating.
[02:17:14.069 --> 02:17:25.176]  And I mean, frankly, I've succumbed to it at times, right, where my wife will come to me and say, and she'll say something like, could you please get off your social media and just pay a bit of attention to us?
[02:17:25.176 --> 02:17:32.541]  It's a very intoxicating set of portals, because it makes us feel as though we're connected with the world.
[02:17:32.541 --> 02:17:34.182]  But paradoxically, it also
[02:17:35.043 --> 02:17:39.066]  Disconnects us from those that maybe are closest to us.
[02:17:39.066 --> 02:17:40.747]  We're talking to Professor Gadsad.
[02:17:40.747 --> 02:17:45.130]  His YouTube channel is youtube.com forward slash Gadsad.
[02:17:45.130 --> 02:17:53.095]  Racing through the topics here, I want to mention universities and free speech because obviously you're a professor, you move amongst these people, some of them are your friends.
[02:17:53.956 --> 02:18:01.359]  You know, trigger warnings, safe spaces, this complete intolerance for intellectual diversity on college campuses.
[02:18:01.359 --> 02:18:11.564]  Banning feminists, and anti-feminists, recently at Manchester University, they had an event called, Does Feminism Have a Problem with Free Speech?
[02:18:11.564 --> 02:18:13.025]  And they banned a feminist.
[02:18:13.465 --> 02:18:23.296]  And an anti-feminist, Julie Bindel and Milo Yiannopoulos, because they might trigger, God forbid, they might challenge the ideas of the people who attend that university.
[02:18:23.296 --> 02:18:32.606]  So when did universities go from, you know, being arenas of vigorous unrestrained debate to progenitors of thought control and censorship, and who's to blame?
[02:18:33.827 --> 02:18:37.270]  Well, I think it's a confluence of factors.
[02:18:37.270 --> 02:18:45.237]  You know, post-modernism came in about 40 years ago and said, hey, look, there are no privileged ways of knowing.
[02:18:45.237 --> 02:18:47.299]  There are no absolute truths.
[02:18:47.299 --> 02:18:48.920]  There are no human universals.
[02:18:49.961 --> 02:18:53.243]  All viewpoints are reasonable and could be held, right?
[02:18:53.243 --> 02:18:57.786]  And so who are you to say that gravity is what makes something fall?
[02:18:57.786 --> 02:19:04.349]  Maybe it's, I love that term, I heard it on Drunken Peasants, maybe it's intelligent falling instead.
[02:19:04.349 --> 02:19:12.994]  So this idea that all possible frameworks are acceptable creates this sort of fake tolerance, right?
[02:19:12.994 --> 02:19:13.214]  Where
[02:19:14.515 --> 02:19:17.298]  You know, who are we to judge about what is true or not?
[02:19:17.298 --> 02:19:26.906]  And so when somebody comes with a very dogmatic position, then they recoil at that, especially when that dogmatic position goes against the politically correct position.
[02:19:26.906 --> 02:19:36.855]  And so I think because of a very variety of confluence of factors, both academics and students are not armed to engage in reasoned debate.
[02:19:37.615 --> 02:19:39.937]  We'll be back with Gad Saad after the break.
[02:19:39.937 --> 02:19:44.220]  Of course, no less than Edward Snowden came out against this yesterday in a tweet.
[02:19:44.220 --> 02:19:51.026]  He said, quote, an individual trying to limit speech at universities is interested in neither university nor justice.
[02:19:51.026 --> 02:19:54.048]  That's what Edward Snowden said about this yesterday.
[02:19:54.048 --> 02:19:54.709]  We'll be back.
[02:19:54.709 --> 02:19:56.751]  Final segment with Gad Saad after the break.
[02:19:56.751 --> 02:19:59.052]  Alex Jones Show live in 4Wars.com.
[02:19:59.052 --> 02:19:59.593]  Stay tuned.
[02:19:59.893 --> 02:20:09.315]  We use mobile devices right against our bodies every day, but growing scientific evidence has emerged showing serious health risks associated with exposure to EMF radiation emitted from these devices.
[02:20:09.315 --> 02:20:13.736]  The solution is DefenderShield, the most effective mobile radiation shielding ever developed.
[02:20:13.736 --> 02:20:20.738]  DefenderShield blocks virtually 100% of EMF radiation from cell phones, tablets, and laptops, and starts at just $64.99.

[02:20:30.063 --> 02:20:30.863]  This is Dan Pilla.
[02:20:30.863 --> 02:20:32.664]  Do you owe the IRS money you can't pay?
[02:20:32.664 --> 02:20:34.304]  Are tax debts crippling you?
[02:20:34.304 --> 02:20:37.125]  I've defended people from the IRS for over 30 years.
[02:20:37.125 --> 02:20:39.425]  I've helped thousands and I can help you too.
[02:20:39.425 --> 02:20:43.926]  I wrote the book on IRS settlement and I'm telling you there's no such thing as a hopeless case.
[02:20:43.926 --> 02:20:47.867]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX to finally get free of IRS debt.
[02:20:47.867 --> 02:20:51.648]  With the IRS's new programs, there's never been a better time to solve your problem.
[02:20:51.648 --> 02:20:51.968]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX.
[02:20:51.968 --> 02:20:53.709]  That's 800-34-NO-TAX or my website, danpilla.com.
[02:20:59.147 --> 02:21:03.430]  Many of the products at Infowarslife.com are true game changers.
[02:21:03.430 --> 02:21:07.694]  They are compounds that in many areas of the world are actually sold by prescription.
[02:21:07.694 --> 02:21:15.039]  But when we look at a product like Survival Shield Mason Iodine X2, it's something that really has been hiding in plain view for over a hundred years.
[02:21:15.039 --> 02:21:25.707]  The federal government mandated from the 20s until the 70s that iodine, a crude form of it, be added to table salt because of the incredible health problems that dietary deficiency in iodine was causing.
[02:21:25.707 --> 02:21:29.030]  I want to challenge the listeners who've not tried X2 for yourselves.
[02:21:29.170 --> 02:21:30.291]  What do you have to lose?
[02:21:30.291 --> 02:21:38.736]  You are the tip of the spear in the fight for human liberty, and you're getting a high-quality product that has absolutely changed my life and many other people's lives that I know.
[02:21:38.736 --> 02:21:42.039]  And the final reason to try X2 is that it's so hard to keep in stock.
[02:21:42.039 --> 02:21:46.201]  We ordered the biggest shipment ever six months ago, and that is about to sell out.
[02:21:46.201 --> 02:21:48.503]  It may be a month or two until more comes in.
[02:21:48.503 --> 02:21:55.468]  I want to challenge all of you in the next week to stock up on Survival Shield X2 today at infowarslife.com or by calling 888-253-3139.
[02:21:59.290 --> 02:22:02.833]  The new frontier in human nutrition and health is that of epigenetics.
[02:22:02.833 --> 02:22:08.699]  Epigenetics refers to the portion of the DNA that you can influence with molecules or frequency signals.
[02:22:08.699 --> 02:22:15.545]  A huge key to detoxification, cellular health, and even eternal youth has to do with what kind of signals you are feeding your cells.
[02:22:15.745 --> 02:22:25.552]  Technology now exists to energetically encode foods or supplements so that the original food you started with is now a carrier of information that communicates health-giving signals to the cells of your body.
[02:22:25.552 --> 02:22:29.135]  The first food of its kind to ever receive this encoding is One World Way.
[02:22:29.135 --> 02:22:33.358]  One World Way has received high praise and generated some amazing testimonies since 2011.
[02:22:33.358 --> 02:22:42.365]  We now know that all the amazing testimonies we've received come primarily from the energy encoding process and secondarily to the high quality ingredients.
[02:22:42.645 --> 02:22:42.825]  Thank you.
[02:22:59.205 --> 02:23:06.967]  NuMana, the true pioneer of healthy storable foods and preparedness products, has gone and done it again.
[02:23:06.967 --> 02:23:14.409]  NuMana is now the first food storage company in the country to offer organic powdered milk, free of hormones.
[02:23:14.409 --> 02:23:17.470]  Our goal is to change the way you look at storable food.
[02:23:18.250 --> 02:23:20.572]  NuMana is GMO free.
[02:23:20.572 --> 02:23:26.456]  Contains no high fructose corn syrup, aspartame, or artificial ingredients.

[02:23:47.046 --> 02:23:47.366]  Newmana.

[02:24:00.626 --> 02:24:06.437]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents The Alex Jones Show.
[02:24:06.437 --> 02:24:08.682]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:24:19.429 --> 02:24:22.832]  It's the Alex Jones Show live with me, your host, Paul Joseph Watson.
[02:24:22.832 --> 02:24:26.775]  Gonna go to your calls after our guest here in about 10 minutes' time.
[02:24:26.775 --> 02:24:27.175]  It's 1-800-259-9231.
[02:24:27.175 --> 02:24:36.483]  We're gonna open the phones up to talk about whatever issue you want, you like, and of course, InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:24:36.483 --> 02:24:38.244]  This is what drives the entire broadcast.
[02:24:39.025 --> 02:24:49.630]  Liver Cleanse, we've got 20% off on B12, we've got Brain Force, we've got Knockout, that's the Sleep Aid, which of course has got great reviews as well.
[02:24:49.630 --> 02:24:53.192]  Infowarsstore.com to get all the supplements.
[02:24:53.192 --> 02:25:00.916]  Of course we also sell t-shirts, DVDs, all manner of other products that you can use for yourself to wake people up to start conversations.
[02:25:01.736 --> 02:25:16.466]  And it all goes to helping this broadcaster, building the platform that we've basically slaved over for the past 20 years to get to this level where we're having a direct impact on the narrative, challenging the mainstream media on all these issues.
[02:25:16.466 --> 02:25:24.932]  Coming up tonight, David Knight's going to be the host for Infowars Nightly News and they're going to be covering the debate, the democratic debate, live of course.
[02:25:25.956 --> 02:25:27.816]  This is the first debate.
[02:25:27.816 --> 02:25:36.698]  Only six are scheduled, so this is going to be a short process, because Hillary Clinton is completely afraid of saying anything whatsoever in public.
[02:25:36.698 --> 02:25:38.538]  That's going to be interesting.
[02:25:38.538 --> 02:25:43.679]  CNN, Anderson Cooper said he's not going to try to mix up the candidates.
[02:25:43.679 --> 02:25:44.960]  David Knight will be.
[02:25:44.960 --> 02:25:52.481]  We'll be grilling them, we'll be analysing them on their actual platform, what they actually stand for, rather than the soundbites
[02:25:53.061 --> 02:26:02.190]  Rather than the surface fluff, and that's all going to be live tonight, InfoWars Nightly News hosted by David Knight, so be sure to tune in for that.
[02:26:02.190 --> 02:26:08.116]  We're talking to behavioural scientist Gad Saad, youtube.com forward slash Gad Saad.
[02:26:08.116 --> 02:26:09.958]  I wanted to touch on radical Islam because
[02:26:10.990 --> 02:26:13.854]  This is a subject that you've delved into, of course.
[02:26:13.854 --> 02:26:25.491]  Whenever I go really hard against Islam on social media, on Infowars.com, and merely question whether it deserves the title of the religion of peace,
[02:26:26.312 --> 02:26:29.294]  I immediately get death threats.
[02:26:29.294 --> 02:26:31.315]  Again, proving my point.
[02:26:31.315 --> 02:26:35.117]  You know, I posted an image of ISIS toilet roll on Facebook.
[02:26:35.117 --> 02:26:38.099]  Got death threats consistently for about two weeks.
[02:26:38.099 --> 02:26:41.101]  Which, again, is why I question whether it's a religion of peace.
[02:26:41.101 --> 02:26:44.123]  But you've been critical of some of the tenets of Islam.
[02:26:44.123 --> 02:26:45.123]  You've looked at the Quran.
[02:26:46.104 --> 02:26:53.955]  And you've criticized liberals for basically not daring to oppose what is fundamentally an illiberal belief system.
[02:26:53.955 --> 02:27:02.948]  So how are liberals able to excuse and justify their immediate abandonment of liberal principles when it comes to criticism of Islam?
[02:27:03.760 --> 02:27:14.923]  I think that's the big blind spot of so-called liberals, or again, I prefer to call them the regressive leftists, a term that is really taking off in the public discourse.
[02:27:14.923 --> 02:27:31.627]  I think it's because they make the mistake of assuming that Islam is a religion of the marginalized, of people of color, and therefore when I look into my playbook of liberalism and progressive
[02:27:32.367 --> 02:27:33.828]  Progressivism.
[02:27:33.828 --> 02:27:45.153]  I know that I should not be criticizing people of color because we all know that it's the patriarchy that's bad, it's the white man that's bad, and therefore I'm faced here with a dilemma.
[02:27:45.153 --> 02:27:52.956]  Is it okay for me to criticize the behavior of others if they score high on the victimology poker hand or not?
[02:27:53.496 --> 02:28:10.428]  Now, there is a new brand of liberals, and I like to think that I'm included in that group, that says, look, if you truly believe in fundamental liberal values, then you have to expect that all ideologies are fair game when it comes to criticism.
[02:28:10.968 --> 02:28:15.251]  Regrettably, the regressive leftists are not willing to do that.
[02:28:15.251 --> 02:28:22.616]  Again, because they view it as racist, phobic, bigoted to criticize an ideology.
[02:28:22.616 --> 02:28:27.419]  When we repeatedly state that you are not attacking individuals,
[02:28:27.859 --> 02:28:37.845]  Most Muslims are undoubtedly perfectly lovely people, and yet the ideology to which they subscribe might contain tenets that are open for criticism.
[02:28:37.845 --> 02:28:41.868]  Surely that should be a liberal value that we all hold dear.
[02:28:41.868 --> 02:28:42.228]  They don't.
[02:28:43.533 --> 02:28:53.143]  And even the Pope came out, you know, after Charlie Hebdo and said, you shouldn't make fun of people's religions, you shouldn't insult people's religions, that's not part of free speech, again.
[02:28:53.143 --> 02:28:54.284]  That was breathtaking.
[02:28:54.284 --> 02:28:55.745]  I just couldn't believe when he said that.
[02:28:55.745 --> 02:28:57.507]  Absolutely astonishing.
[02:28:57.507 --> 02:29:01.011]  What I wanted to ask though is, you know, we've had polls in France a few months ago.
[02:29:01.351 --> 02:29:10.457]  They found that 25% of young people in France, this is 18 to 25 year olds, 25% in France support ISIS.
[02:29:10.457 --> 02:29:17.162]  That doesn't mean they're violent militants, it doesn't mean they're going to go and be terrorists, but ideologically they support ISIS.
[02:29:17.162 --> 02:29:20.664]  We've found similar numbers in other European countries.
[02:29:20.664 --> 02:29:23.006]  I'll ask this question after the break, we're going to talk about that.
[02:29:23.006 --> 02:29:30.291]  We're going to give Gad Saad the final word on evolutionary consumption as well, and we're going to plug his YouTube channel, tell you how you can get his books.
[02:29:30.851 --> 02:29:32.891]  This is the Alex Jones Show live again.
[02:29:32.891 --> 02:29:38.973]  David Knight coming up tonight with live Democratic debate coverage on the InfoWars Nightly News.
[02:29:38.973 --> 02:29:40.553]  Your calls coming up 1-800-259-9231.
[02:29:40.553 --> 02:29:45.334]  This is the Alex Jones Show live InfoWars.com.
[02:29:45.334 --> 02:29:48.975]  Stay tuned.
[02:29:48.975 --> 02:29:50.375]  We're on the march.
[02:29:50.375 --> 02:29:52.895]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:29:52.895 --> 02:29:55.576]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:29:59.890 --> 02:30:05.952]  A paranoid professor quits UT after the university allows concealed carry.
[02:30:05.952 --> 02:30:18.277]  A University of Texas professor is quitting his job and moving from Austin to Australia because of the university's decision to allow students to carry concealed handguns on campus.
[02:30:18.277 --> 02:30:27.361]  Economics professor Daniel Hammermesh is now worried that a disgruntled student might bring a gun into the classroom and start shooting.
[02:30:27.401 --> 02:30:31.003]  The issue is not so much somebody coming into the classroom from the outside.
[02:30:31.003 --> 02:30:39.209]  It's rather a student in the classroom or, more likely, a student in my office who's upset about a grade and who pulls a gun on me.
[02:30:39.209 --> 02:30:40.150]  I'm not going to carry a gun.
[02:30:40.150 --> 02:30:41.871]  I don't want to be involved in a gun fight.
[02:30:41.871 --> 02:30:50.296]  So apparently, paranoid Professor Hammermesh would rather see his students left defenseless and unarmed in the events of an emergency.
[02:30:50.296 --> 02:30:54.419]  Will Von Voyage Professor take your liberal logic and run?

[02:33:00.614 --> 02:33:07.118]  This transmission is coming to you.
[02:33:07.118 --> 02:33:11.500]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:33:11.500 --> 02:33:17.144]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[02:33:27.292 --> 02:33:28.392]  It's the Alex Jones Show live.
[02:33:28.392 --> 02:33:29.833]  I'm your host Paul Joseph Watson.
[02:33:29.833 --> 02:33:32.694]  We're just finishing up here in the final five minutes with Gadsad.
[02:33:32.694 --> 02:33:34.734]  We'll be going to your calls after that.
[02:33:34.734 --> 02:33:37.175]  Before the break, I just mentioned radical Islam.
[02:33:37.175 --> 02:33:38.795]  Again, it's a topic that I've covered.
[02:33:38.795 --> 02:33:42.577]  It's a topic that Gadsad has covered on his YouTube channel.
[02:33:42.577 --> 02:33:44.737]  Again, polls in France.
[02:33:44.737 --> 02:33:48.318]  25% of young people show ideological support for ISIS.
[02:33:48.318 --> 02:33:50.179]  Similar polls in other European countries.
[02:33:50.819 --> 02:33:59.666]  Just quickly on this Gadsad, how wide of the mark is this idea that advocates of radical Islam are only a tiny, tiny minority?
[02:34:00.717 --> 02:34:04.019]  Well, I guess it depends how we define extremists, right?
[02:34:04.019 --> 02:34:06.800]  And I think Sam Harris tried to make that point.
[02:34:06.800 --> 02:34:15.464]  So if you say an extremist is somebody who holds very violent views and is willing to act on them, well then it might be just a very small few percentages.
[02:34:15.464 --> 02:34:24.028]  If it's people who support those guys, but then are not willing to themselves engage in the actual violence, then it becomes much larger.
[02:34:24.808 --> 02:34:29.789]  If you like, the concentric circle gets larger depending on how we define extremism.
[02:34:29.789 --> 02:34:31.890]  But even if the number were very small, right?
[02:34:31.890 --> 02:34:41.372]  I mean, let's be charitable and say 5% of all people who are adherents of Islam are the most problematic.
[02:34:41.372 --> 02:34:45.933]  Well, 5% of 1.6 billion people is still a very sizable number.
[02:34:45.933 --> 02:34:50.554]  And so to argue that it is irrational, it is Islamophobic, right?
[02:34:50.554 --> 02:34:53.035]  It is a term that actually makes it
[02:34:54.136 --> 02:34:56.998]  Insane for you to be afraid of that threat, right?
[02:34:56.998 --> 02:34:57.958]  You are insane.
[02:34:57.958 --> 02:35:03.241]  You suffer from an irrational phobia if you're fearful of that 5%.
[02:35:03.241 --> 02:35:05.242]  That's how, again, you shut down debate, right?
[02:35:05.242 --> 02:35:14.607]  Because people are going to think twice before they try to criticize an ideology that's going to certainly come after you, if not physically, to harm your reputation.
[02:35:14.607 --> 02:35:16.848]  So there is something to worry about.
[02:35:16.848 --> 02:35:21.651]  And the more people get up to talk about it, the better it will be for our future.
[02:35:22.475 --> 02:35:28.257]  And again, just because you criticise radical belief systems, like radical Islam, doesn't mean that you hate Muslims.
[02:35:28.257 --> 02:35:36.200]  Just because you criticise radical feminism, which the vast majority of women don't even embrace, doesn't mean that you hate women.
[02:35:36.200 --> 02:35:40.141]  I'm sorry, let me just take a very simple example.
[02:35:40.701 --> 02:35:46.345]  There is a prayer in Judaism that says something to the effect of, you know, thank you God for not making me a woman.
[02:35:46.345 --> 02:35:51.969]  Now if I say, you know, I think that that particular prayer is abhorrent, it's misogynistic.
[02:35:51.969 --> 02:35:55.372]  I am making a specific statement about that particular tenet.
[02:35:55.372 --> 02:35:58.174]  It doesn't mean that I am anti-Jewish or anti-Semitic.
[02:35:58.174 --> 02:35:59.315]  Same idea with Islam.
[02:35:59.315 --> 02:36:07.701]  I could look at a particular tenet and criticize it without in no way implying any hatred or bigotry to people who are adherents of that religion.
[02:36:09.062 --> 02:36:13.706]  Okay, just finishing up, I wanted to give you basically an open platform for a couple of minutes.
[02:36:13.706 --> 02:36:15.568]  Evolutionary consumption.
[02:36:15.568 --> 02:36:17.750]  You founded this field of study.
[02:36:17.750 --> 02:36:21.873]  Explain to the listeners what this is and what it tells us about human behavior.
[02:36:21.873 --> 02:36:29.980]  So basically, contrary to most consumer psychologists, all consumer psychologists, which basically looked at consumer behavior as something that's learned, right?
[02:36:29.980 --> 02:36:31.942]  We are socialized to become consumers.
[02:36:31.942 --> 02:36:36.446]  We learn it from advertising, we learn it from movies, we learn it from our parents, from our peers.
[02:36:36.946 --> 02:36:39.487]  I came along and said, well, of course the environment matters.
[02:36:39.487 --> 02:36:53.732]  Yes, part of what makes us consumers is our unique environments, but there must be some indelible features of our evolutionary history that manifests itself when we put on our consumer hats.
[02:36:53.732 --> 02:36:58.154]  And so the work that I do looks at these biological underpinnings.
[02:36:58.154 --> 02:37:02.115]  So let me just give you a tangible example in case some of your viewers might not know what I'm talking about.
[02:37:02.535 --> 02:37:08.961]  So I did a study where I looked at how do women alter their beautification practices?
[02:37:08.961 --> 02:37:09.741]  How do they dress?
[02:37:09.741 --> 02:37:11.663]  Do they dress more sexually or less?
[02:37:11.663 --> 02:37:13.424]  Do they wear makeup or not?
[02:37:13.424 --> 02:37:17.328]  And I looked at that as a function of where they were in their menstrual cycle.
[02:37:17.808 --> 02:37:30.098]  Specifically, I argued that at the point of their menstrual cycle where they are in the ovulatory phase, in the fertile phase, this is where they would want to advertise themselves in the mating market, right?
[02:37:30.098 --> 02:37:37.964]  And therefore, we did a study, this was one of my former doctoral students, where we tracked women's behavior for 35 continuous days because 35 days covers
[02:37:39.205 --> 02:37:41.267]  The length of most menstrual cycles.
[02:37:41.267 --> 02:37:42.788]  And we exactly found that.
[02:37:42.788 --> 02:37:46.170]  When women are maximally fertile, they signal, right?
[02:37:46.170 --> 02:37:48.932]  To go back to the signaling question that we were talking about earlier.
[02:37:48.932 --> 02:38:01.660]  Well, that particular research question would have never been within the purview of a consumer psychologist who didn't recognize that consumers are biological beings that are shaped by these evolutionary forces.
[02:38:01.660 --> 02:38:08.705]  So what I try to do basically is marry biology and evolutionary theory in the context of consumer behavior.
[02:38:09.907 --> 02:38:12.273]  And some of your videos on this have been really fascinating.
[02:38:12.273 --> 02:38:18.066]  Again, just in closing, tell people how they can find your YouTube channel, your Twitter and some of your books.
[02:38:19.031 --> 02:38:22.413]  Right, so my books, if you go to Amazon, all my books are listed.
[02:38:22.413 --> 02:38:27.537]  There's The Consuming Instinct, The Evolutionary Basis of Consumption, Evolutionary Psychology, and The Business Sciences.
[02:38:27.537 --> 02:38:29.138]  I hope you check them out.
[02:38:29.138 --> 02:38:36.804]  I have a YouTube channel, so slash, I don't remember the exact thing, but if you do Gatsad, you'll find me.
[02:38:36.804 --> 02:38:41.327]  Each of my videos is called The Sad Truth and whatever the number is of that video.
[02:38:41.707 --> 02:38:57.340]  I cover all sorts of things, evolutionary psychology, consumer behavior, politics, the thought police, religion, and then of course they can follow me on Twitter at GADSAAD, or they can go to my public Facebook page, Dr. period, GAD period, sad.
[02:38:57.340 --> 02:38:59.082]  So, different ways for us to connect.
[02:38:59.082 --> 02:39:00.163]  I hope you check out my work.
[02:39:00.902 --> 02:39:04.185]  And you can see some of those accounts up on screen just a moment ago.
[02:39:04.185 --> 02:39:05.185]  It's been fascinating.
[02:39:05.185 --> 02:39:06.026]  Gadsad.
[02:39:06.026 --> 02:39:07.768]  We'll be sure to check in with you again.
[02:39:07.768 --> 02:39:10.750]  Thanks for joining us today on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:39:10.750 --> 02:39:12.011]  Thank you so much for having me, Paul.
[02:39:12.011 --> 02:39:12.711]  Talk to you soon.
[02:39:12.711 --> 02:39:13.352]  Thank you.
[02:39:13.352 --> 02:39:14.693]  There goes Gadsad again.
[02:39:14.693 --> 02:39:17.796]  YouTube.com forward slash Gadsad.
[02:39:17.796 --> 02:39:22.699]  Gonna go to some of these calls now, because some of them have been literally waiting almost three hours.
[02:39:22.699 --> 02:39:24.341]  Phil in Iowa.
[02:39:24.341 --> 02:39:24.901]  You're on the air.
[02:39:24.901 --> 02:39:27.183]  You want to talk about the presidential event today.
[02:39:27.183 --> 02:39:27.904]  Phil, you're on the air.
[02:39:27.904 --> 02:39:28.204]  Go ahead.
[02:39:30.362 --> 02:39:32.602]  Hello, thank you for having me on the show, Paul.
[02:39:32.602 --> 02:39:33.343]  I've been listening to you.
[02:39:33.343 --> 02:39:35.023]  Long-time listener, first-time caller.
[02:39:35.023 --> 02:39:36.843]  That's great.
[02:39:36.843 --> 02:39:38.424]  And you're doing a great job.
[02:39:38.424 --> 02:39:42.745]  I mean, I would tune in even if I wasn't calling.
[02:39:42.745 --> 02:39:46.505]  Let me tell you why my call today is very specific.
[02:39:46.505 --> 02:39:49.486]  Love everything you guys were talking about.
[02:39:49.486 --> 02:39:50.686]  Love learning about Gad.
[02:39:50.686 --> 02:39:53.307]  That's the first time I've heard of him, so I'm gonna
[02:39:53.996 --> 02:39:55.057]  Definitely look him up.
[02:39:55.057 --> 02:39:56.438]  Gadsad, just Google it.
[02:39:56.438 --> 02:39:59.720]  It took me right to his Twitter, so real easy to find.
[02:39:59.720 --> 02:40:02.561]  And that's, why am I calling you?
[02:40:02.561 --> 02:40:03.942]  I am in Iowa.
[02:40:03.942 --> 02:40:05.503]  Do you know the significance of that?
[02:40:05.503 --> 02:40:07.444]  Sure.
[02:40:07.444 --> 02:40:09.746]  If you make us mad, we'll elect your president.
[02:40:09.746 --> 02:40:12.687]  That's what we do here in Iowa.
[02:40:12.687 --> 02:40:16.810]  We have the first in the nation Iowa caucus, and
[02:40:17.600 --> 02:40:19.421]  That's a little bit different than the primary.
[02:40:19.421 --> 02:40:26.465]  What we got coming up here in October, it's a Saturday, October 24th, about two weeks.
[02:40:26.465 --> 02:40:29.767]  I'm going to have all the Republican presidential candidates.
[02:40:29.767 --> 02:40:34.951]  I'm an executive director for an organization, national organization called Patriots for Christ.
[02:40:34.951 --> 02:40:37.452]  Patriots for Christ USA, Paul.
[02:40:37.452 --> 02:40:40.894]  We are not politically correct.
[02:40:40.894 --> 02:40:42.275]  We are biblically correct.
[02:40:44.291 --> 02:40:48.894]  And I think what people worry about with political correctness is they're going to offend somebody and be obnoxious.
[02:40:48.894 --> 02:40:56.039]  They don't want to appear obnoxious, and I do that anyway, but being biblically correct, I'm less likely to do that.
[02:40:56.039 --> 02:40:59.001]  So, again, so we've got the presidents.
[02:40:59.001 --> 02:41:01.943]  Why did I call?
[02:41:01.943 --> 02:41:12.730]  Paul, I'm going to be there, and there may be a specific candidate you'd like to ask a question of, and you don't have Jeb Bush there in one of his shills to do it.
[02:41:14.148 --> 02:41:17.470]  I'm going to do it, and my organization will do it.
[02:41:17.470 --> 02:41:26.554]  It's going to be a town hall question and answer, but for those people that can't make it, we're going to have them Twitter their question.
[02:41:26.554 --> 02:41:27.754]  Are you still with me, Paul?
[02:41:27.754 --> 02:41:28.875]  Sounds good to me.
[02:41:28.875 --> 02:41:39.920]  Be sure to call us back and tell us what happened, but sounds like a very good idea to challenge some of these Republican candidates, especially on their flip-flopping when it comes to the likes of Donald Trump.
[02:41:39.920 --> 02:41:41.521]  Erica in Ohio, you're on the air.
[02:41:41.521 --> 02:41:42.121]  Go ahead, Erica.
[02:41:44.053 --> 02:41:45.334]  My pleasure to talk to you.
[02:41:45.334 --> 02:41:48.997]  I wanted to say that I wanted to plug the X2.
[02:41:48.997 --> 02:41:51.438]  It's also very good topically.
[02:41:51.438 --> 02:41:52.639]  I got stung by a bee.
[02:41:52.639 --> 02:41:53.780]  I do landscaping.
[02:41:53.780 --> 02:41:56.162]  I get stung frequently.
[02:41:56.162 --> 02:42:03.287]  Usually it swells and hurts for hours, but I put the X2 on it and I forgot I even got stung a half hour later.
[02:42:04.033 --> 02:42:07.096]  I also use it for an acne spot treatment.
[02:42:07.096 --> 02:42:09.798]  It works good on acne as well.
[02:42:09.798 --> 02:42:18.485]  A good way that I wake people up is I have them try a bite of a GMO strawberry and then I have them try a bite of an organic strawberry.
[02:42:18.485 --> 02:42:23.429]  There is a big difference in taste there and then they're usually open to hear whatever else I have to say.
[02:42:24.813 --> 02:42:26.734]  Yeah, I mean... But the reason that I'm calling... Go ahead.
[02:42:26.734 --> 02:42:27.555]  Oh, go ahead.
[02:42:27.555 --> 02:42:30.837]  No, I'm just saying, I mean, these reviews are unsolicited.
[02:42:30.837 --> 02:42:33.359]  We don't ask people to call in and say this stuff.
[02:42:33.359 --> 02:42:41.544]  Which is why, if you look on the actual InfoWarsStore.com website, we have all these independent third-party reviews of people who have got these products and they work for them.
[02:42:41.544 --> 02:42:43.806]  And we get people calling in the show on a regular basis.
[02:42:44.406 --> 02:42:56.317]  Advocating these products, again completely unsolicited, which is why, you know, people are really resonating with the efficacy of these different nutrients and supplements, X2, nascent iodine being one of them.
[02:42:56.317 --> 02:42:58.139]  But go ahead, what was your other point today?
[02:42:59.858 --> 02:43:01.900]  Um, my little brother is in high school.
[02:43:01.900 --> 02:43:05.965]  He was a junior last year and I got him to start listening to the show with me.
[02:43:05.965 --> 02:43:14.515]  Um, last year when he was a junior, his history teacher told him that the Constitution was only meant to last 50 years.
[02:43:14.515 --> 02:43:19.401]  They're trying to teach children that the Constitution is outdated and that we need something new.
[02:43:20.239 --> 02:43:39.426]  No, and you see that in a lot of the exam papers, really rubbishing the Constitution, introducing the idea that it's, you know, amenable, changeable, and really not teaching true American history, teaching this progressive slant on everything that America is bad and that we have to atone for our sins and all that kind of stuff.
[02:43:39.426 --> 02:43:43.987]  So, you know, it's really a problem and it's why homeschooling is becoming more and more popular.
[02:43:43.987 --> 02:43:46.208]  Thanks for the call, Erica.
[02:43:46.208 --> 02:43:48.989]  Joachim in Pennsylvania, you're on the air, go ahead.
[02:43:50.458 --> 02:43:50.778]  Hello.
[02:43:50.778 --> 02:43:53.640]  Hey, go ahead, you're on the air, what's your point today?
[02:43:53.640 --> 02:44:00.385]  I first want to say I'm delighted to be on the air with you, and I am an info warrior.
[02:44:00.385 --> 02:44:10.631]  I want to make two points today, simply and as beautifully as I can, in a positive sense, and you've been asking for positive input, which we need.
[02:44:10.631 --> 02:44:11.612]  Sure, sounds good, go ahead.
[02:44:12.754 --> 02:44:19.796]  We're overwhelmed as a nation and a world with the information just invading us all areas.
[02:44:19.796 --> 02:44:36.741]  I'm a man that's focused and one of the things I want to stop today with you and say, Mr. Obama made a statement to the nation about trusting him and government.
[02:44:36.741 --> 02:44:41.802]  That hit me because this is the issue for informed people.
[02:44:42.822 --> 02:44:49.905]  For people that are aware of what's going on, there is no trust.
[02:44:49.905 --> 02:44:56.967]  And perhaps it's time for us to boldly step up and say, well, our U.S.
[02:44:56.967 --> 02:45:00.969]  motto has been, in God we trust, even the Feds put it on our money.
[02:45:02.196 --> 02:45:05.458]  In God we trust, maybe somebody would say, which God?
[02:45:05.458 --> 02:45:08.721]  And that would be a great question to discuss.
[02:45:08.721 --> 02:45:15.545]  Well yeah, we've got the article on Infowars.com, Obama, American suspicious of government, is paralyzing.
[02:45:15.545 --> 02:45:18.747]  And you know, he's made similar comments on this in the past.
[02:45:18.747 --> 02:45:23.471]  He's actually almost directly, not by name, but it was obvious, called out Alex Jones for
[02:45:24.131 --> 02:45:27.373]  Encouraging people to have distrust in government.
[02:45:27.373 --> 02:45:31.156]  It's not Alex Jones' fault that people have distrust in government.
[02:45:31.156 --> 02:45:33.838]  It's not Infowars' fault that they have distrust in government.
[02:45:34.696 --> 02:45:36.457]  It's the fact that you can't trust government.
[02:45:36.457 --> 02:45:37.577]  That's who's to blame for that.
[02:45:37.577 --> 02:45:43.939]  So when Obama tries to shift the blame and say that this is paralyzing his agenda, why is that a bad thing?
[02:45:43.939 --> 02:45:44.759]  That's a good thing.
[02:45:44.759 --> 02:45:48.500]  Trust in media, trust in government is at an all-time low.
[02:45:48.500 --> 02:45:54.662]  Of course it does have negative side effects where people will then go out and trust anybody else.
[02:45:54.662 --> 02:46:01.303]  Doesn't necessarily mean that just because somebody's saying something different from the mainstream media that that's immediately true.
[02:46:01.303 --> 02:46:03.004]  You still have to have discernment
[02:46:03.464 --> 02:46:08.909]  But again, that's positive from, you know, the angle of not trusting government is what brings freedom.
[02:46:08.909 --> 02:46:10.170]  You need gridlock.
[02:46:10.170 --> 02:46:11.531]  You need dissent.
[02:46:11.531 --> 02:46:18.417]  You don't want the rah-rah behind the president, you know, 90% approval rating, because that's how tyranny happens.
[02:46:18.417 --> 02:46:20.820]  That's how the Constitution gets shredded.
[02:46:20.820 --> 02:46:23.762]  And that article is up on the Drudge Report, Obama.
[02:46:23.762 --> 02:46:27.446]  American suspicion of government is paralyzing.
[02:46:27.446 --> 02:46:29.668]  Key article there by Steve Watson, go and read that.
[02:46:30.598 --> 02:46:32.979]  Lauren in Ohio with solutions.
[02:46:32.979 --> 02:46:33.839]  You're on the air, Lauren.
[02:46:33.839 --> 02:46:34.860]  Go ahead.
[02:46:34.860 --> 02:46:35.700]  Yeah, absolutely.
[02:46:35.700 --> 02:46:38.241]  And the solution is we understand what this country is.
[02:46:38.241 --> 02:46:44.103]  That Constitution is a body of negative law to control the maids and the butlers, the workers for government.
[02:46:44.103 --> 02:46:46.484]  Not to tell the free people how they should live.
[02:46:46.484 --> 02:46:51.506]  So if we understood that, and the fact that the Declaration of Independence, what is the purpose of government?
[02:46:51.506 --> 02:46:55.368]  To protect life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness for all men.
[02:46:55.368 --> 02:46:57.489]  So here's the solution.
[02:46:57.489 --> 02:46:58.009]  Obey God first.
[02:46:58.029 --> 02:46:59.509]  First, it's ten little commandments.
[02:46:59.509 --> 02:47:00.490]  Who wants to be murdered?
[02:47:00.490 --> 02:47:02.010]  Who wants to be stolen from?
[02:47:02.010 --> 02:47:05.411]  If we would do the way God says to do, we wouldn't have these problems.
[02:47:05.411 --> 02:47:07.492]  Number two, keep your money in your pocket.
[02:47:07.492 --> 02:47:09.593]  Stop paying tax money that you don't owe.
[02:47:09.593 --> 02:47:12.934]  Why don't you look up the U.S.
[02:47:12.934 --> 02:47:20.476]  statute that basically tells you if it's your election to be in the government and pay taxes or not.
[02:47:21.016 --> 02:47:34.365]  And I believe it's 26 USC 6013 G4A is how to exempt yourself to send notification to the IRS to withdraw your signatures from the W-4, the contract where you're going to give them your money.
[02:47:34.365 --> 02:47:38.548]  Number three, keep your children in your home or privately school them.
[02:47:38.548 --> 02:47:44.952]  Meaning you could hire a teacher, six people on a block, hire a teacher and have that teacher teach your children what you want them to learn.
[02:47:44.952 --> 02:47:50.676]  The mass indoctrination would not be possible except that we have these massive public school institutions.
[02:47:51.217 --> 02:47:52.340]  Okay, thanks for the call.
[02:47:52.340 --> 02:47:55.369]  We'll have to stick with three for now because we've got these calls holding.
[02:47:55.369 --> 02:47:56.914]  Matt in Oklahoma has been waiting a while.
[02:47:56.914 --> 02:47:57.856]  Matt, you're on the air, go ahead.
[02:47:59.133 --> 02:48:00.213]  Hey, thanks for having me on.
[02:48:00.213 --> 02:48:06.335]  I'm going to try to bounce around real quick as fast as I can because I have a lot of stuff that you guys will find interesting.
[02:48:06.335 --> 02:48:20.899]  The odd thing that I heard this morning, you know, is on NPR, which is kind of a strange source for this, but they said that Playboy is no longer going to be publishing fully nude women in their magazines because the political atmosphere has changed too much.
[02:48:20.899 --> 02:48:25.320]  So they've totally, you know, neutered, if you will, it down to maximum
[02:48:26.961 --> 02:48:35.245]  No, I mean, this is a theme that we've seen with sex-negative feminists.
[02:48:35.245 --> 02:48:44.810]  You know, whether you agree with nude women in playbill or not, I mean, whether you agree with porn or not, it's about preventing women from making their own choices.
[02:48:44.810 --> 02:48:53.454]  You know, they're banning grid girls, they're banning all kinds of avenues for women to have careers by using their attractiveness, by using their good looks.
[02:48:53.914 --> 02:49:01.377]  And it's basically, again, ugly, obnoxious feminists that nobody is attracted to hating attractive, successful women.
[02:49:01.377 --> 02:49:03.038]  That's what it boils down to.
[02:49:03.038 --> 02:49:11.421]  And that's why this politically correct wave of sex negativism, preventing women from doing what they want to, we're seeing it more and more.
[02:49:11.421 --> 02:49:12.181]  And we're seeing it today.
[02:49:12.181 --> 02:49:15.843]  Playboy says it will no longer print images of nude women.
[02:49:15.843 --> 02:49:20.184]  So again, that is another story which we posted up on the website.
[02:49:20.184 --> 02:49:21.405]  John in Texas, you're on the air.
[02:49:21.405 --> 02:49:21.845]  Go ahead, John.
[02:49:23.951 --> 02:49:25.052]  Yes, good afternoon.
[02:49:25.052 --> 02:49:36.126]  I was talking about here in Austin yesterday, there was an incredible display of chemtrail or vaportrail as one would perceive it.
[02:49:36.126 --> 02:49:42.193]  And the reason I'm calling is for the people that have a problem with the chemtrail explanation.
[02:49:43.034 --> 02:49:52.166]  They would say to me, well commercial airlines are flying and just the conditions today are ripe for vapor trails and there's just vapor trails all over the place.
[02:49:52.166 --> 02:50:00.035]  Well today the conditions are the same and anybody take a look outside there's not a single, single one hadn't been all day.
[02:50:00.035 --> 02:50:01.137]  And yesterday
[02:50:01.926 --> 02:50:03.526]  I mean, the sky was painted.
[02:50:03.526 --> 02:50:04.927]  There were so many of them.
[02:50:04.927 --> 02:50:12.849]  And then also, commercial airliners run in corridors, and the whole sky was painted with vapor or chemtrails, as you would have it.
[02:50:12.849 --> 02:50:27.132]  And I just wanted to bring that up, and I wish that there would be somebody that's got the scientific whatever or the money to take some samples of the dust that's fallen on the city this week and have it analyzed and see what they've been spraying on us.
[02:50:27.677 --> 02:50:29.378]  They actually did analyse some of that.
[02:50:29.378 --> 02:50:31.420]  I think it was back five or six years ago.
[02:50:31.420 --> 02:50:36.844]  There was a news channel that analysed it, but it turned out that the original tests were wrong, so it's still up for debate.
[02:50:36.844 --> 02:50:44.690]  Obviously, different atmospheric conditions do produce different effects in terms of contrails, and it's an issue that we've covered at length.
[02:50:44.690 --> 02:50:49.714]  Gonna try and fit in one or two more of your calls in the final segment of the Alex Jones Show Live.
[02:50:49.714 --> 02:50:51.275]  Also, a little bit of news coming up.
[02:50:51.275 --> 02:50:52.456]  Stay tuned for that.
[02:50:52.456 --> 02:50:54.198]  Infowars.com.

[02:51:08.456 --> 02:51:15.244]  I used to work in a pretty stressful atmosphere, but I started using the whole tones in the office, and I'm experiencing more focus.
[02:51:15.684 --> 02:51:19.506]  Motivation, peace, and better relationships.

[02:53:47.155 --> 02:53:49.415]  Freedom is just another word for nothing left to lose.
[02:54:16.039 --> 02:54:18.262]  Final segment of the Alex Jones Show.
[02:54:18.262 --> 02:54:21.005]  Of course, we've got the fourth hour coming up with David Knight.
[02:54:21.005 --> 02:54:24.390]  Moscow's embassy rocketed after US armed Al-Nusra.
[02:54:24.870 --> 02:54:26.132]  Calls for killing Russians.
[02:54:26.132 --> 02:54:30.136]  This is an article by Kurt Nimmo up on Infowars.com.
[02:54:30.136 --> 02:54:38.847]  After the US provided insurgents in Syria with tons for ammunition and weapons, the Russian embassy in Damascus was struck by two rockets.
[02:54:38.847 --> 02:54:44.834]  AFP reports claim the rockets were fired by Islamist rebels from the eastern edge of the capital.
[02:54:45.529 --> 02:54:52.815]  No deaths or injuries were reported, but obviously now they're targeting Russia because of Russia's airstrikes against Syria.
[02:54:52.815 --> 02:55:05.687]  Again, this is about a week after John McCain came out and said, basically, we need to arm the rebels to an even greater degree so they can shoot down Russian fighter jets, again, threatening to cause World War III.
[02:55:05.687 --> 02:55:06.487]  And he basically said,
[02:55:07.168 --> 02:55:09.170]  Just like we did in Afghanistan.
[02:55:09.170 --> 02:55:12.112]  Just like we armed jihadists in Afghanistan.
[02:55:12.112 --> 02:55:14.714]  Which of course, you know, that was a cakewalk, wasn't it?
[02:55:14.714 --> 02:55:17.156]  That had no bad consequences whatsoever.
[02:55:17.156 --> 02:55:20.799]  Only the rise of Al-Qaeda, Osama Bin Laden, and 9-11.
[02:55:20.799 --> 02:55:21.980]  Yeah, what could go wrong, right?
[02:55:22.600 --> 02:55:39.147]  So they've given these weapons to the FSA jihadists, they hand them on to al-Nusra, they hand them on to these other jihadist groups, they hand them on to ISIS in many cases, they defect to ISIS, and now we've got jihadists just outside of Damascus rocket attacking the Russian embassy.
[02:55:39.147 --> 02:55:39.848]  We've also got...
[02:55:40.828 --> 02:55:42.929]  Zero Hedge reporting U.S.
[02:55:42.929 --> 02:55:46.190]  paradrops 50 tons of ammo to Syrian rebels.
[02:55:46.190 --> 02:55:50.292]  So it was in the media, you know, we're scaling back the arming of the Syrian rebels.
[02:55:50.292 --> 02:55:54.754]  They trained four or five moderates at a cost of $500 million.
[02:55:54.754 --> 02:56:00.957]  A complete failure of a policy, if you believe it was ever meant to fail in the first place.
[02:56:00.957 --> 02:56:06.159]  Now that Russia is actually wiping out ISIS, these NATO armed, these U.S.
[02:56:06.159 --> 02:56:09.721]  armed jihadists are targeting Russia to an even greater degree.
[02:56:10.501 --> 02:56:17.585]  Because they don't want Russia to wipe out ISIS because ISIS is allied with NATO in terms of toppling Bashar al-Assad.
[02:56:17.585 --> 02:56:19.326]  Final caller, Mike in Wyoming.
[02:56:19.326 --> 02:56:22.708]  You're on the air, go ahead Mike.
[02:56:22.708 --> 02:56:24.249]  Yes, hi Paul.
[02:56:24.249 --> 02:56:26.811]  I tried to make this point once before but apparently didn't...
[02:56:29.524 --> 02:56:41.112]  There's a good book called Surrendering Islam by a guy named Livingston that explains this radical, so-called fundamentalist Islam in Saudi and the other Gulf states.
[02:56:41.112 --> 02:56:50.239]  It was created by British intelligence back in the middle of the 19th century for the purpose of imploding Islam from within.
[02:56:50.239 --> 02:56:55.142]  They used a whacked-out character named Abdul Wahab
[02:56:55.885 --> 02:57:04.632]  As in Wahhabi, who hated Islam, wanted to go back to the pre-Islamic pagan gods.
[02:57:04.632 --> 02:57:12.677]  And you can distinguish these guys by the black satanic uniforms and flags that they fly.
[02:57:12.677 --> 02:57:16.000]  They are not true Islam, even though they've been led to believe that they are.
[02:57:16.710 --> 02:57:30.963]  That's not to say that ordinary Islam is necessarily compatible with the West, but these guys, the al-Nusra's and the ISIS and these other related sects, are heretics within Islam.
[02:57:30.963 --> 02:57:37.189]  And we don't want to go to war with the entire Islamic world, and it's important to make that distinction.
[02:57:39.038 --> 02:57:40.158]  No, it definitely isn't.
[02:57:40.158 --> 02:57:43.020]  I don't think that's a distinction that really translates.
[02:57:43.020 --> 02:57:50.064]  I mean, in a sense, ISIS have become rock stars to many Muslims, even immigrants living in European countries.
[02:57:50.064 --> 02:57:55.307]  We mentioned the polls earlier, you know, 25% of young people in France support ISIS.
[02:57:55.307 --> 02:57:59.750]  So it's a major problem tearing down this image that ISIS represents all Islam.
[02:58:00.470 --> 02:58:05.872]  Or the cool, the hip, the edgy side of Islam, when of course it's completely barbaric.
[02:58:05.872 --> 02:58:07.633]  That's going to do it though for the Alex Jones Show.
[02:58:07.633 --> 02:58:10.554]  We've got David Knight coming up for the fourth hour.
[02:58:10.554 --> 02:58:16.536]  Basically we're going to have a live coverage of the democratic debates tonight on the InfoWars Nightly News.
[02:58:16.536 --> 02:58:18.357]  David Knight and Liam McAdoo.
[02:58:18.357 --> 02:58:18.897]  The Twitter
[02:58:19.557 --> 02:58:22.600]  Hashtag is hashtag DemDebate.
[02:58:22.600 --> 02:58:24.781]  So that's coming up on the InfoWars Nightly News.
[02:58:24.781 --> 02:58:26.523]  Be sure to tune in for that.
[02:58:26.523 --> 02:58:29.585]  But stick around next because David Knight is going to cover this issue.
[02:58:29.585 --> 02:58:34.890]  He's going to talk about what the candidates really stand for, what media is not going to tell you about them.
[02:58:34.890 --> 02:58:37.172]  I've been Paul Joseph Watson for the Alex Jones Show.
[02:58:37.172 --> 02:58:40.254]  InfoWars.com.
[02:58:40.254 --> 02:58:41.655]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[02:58:49.437 --> 02:58:52.940]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[02:58:52.940 --> 02:59:01.187]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[02:59:01.187 --> 02:59:06.611]  Just one of the key compounds, BioPQQ, is backed by major clinical studies.
[02:59:06.611 --> 02:59:09.134]  You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?

[02:59:22.662 --> 02:59:27.644]  You've probably noticed I've been more focused, less brain fog, more energy, and it's because of BrainForce.
[02:59:27.644 --> 02:59:29.344]  There's always hidden additives in your food.
[02:59:29.344 --> 02:59:30.945]  Even organic food has hidden additives.
[02:59:30.945 --> 02:59:34.426]  Staring at the computer all day, working, doing good, you're still damaging your brain.
[02:59:34.426 --> 02:59:36.407]  Ultimately, we've all been dumbed down to some degree.
[02:59:36.407 --> 02:59:37.327]  It doesn't have stimulants.
[02:59:37.327 --> 02:59:38.507]  It doesn't have garbage in it.
[02:59:38.507 --> 02:59:40.508]  It has natural things that do it clean.
[02:59:40.508 --> 02:59:46.110]  You will find BrainForce and other game-changing products at InfoWarsLife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[02:59:52.071 --> 03:00:02.175]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:02.175 --> 03:00:08.817]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[03:00:08.817 --> 03:00:11.798]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:00:15.094 --> 03:00:16.395]  Welcome to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:16.395 --> 03:00:23.897]  I'm David Knight, your host for this fourth hour, the news wrap-up, and we're going to talk a little bit about what's coming up tonight, the Democrat debate.
[03:00:23.897 --> 03:00:26.578]  Of course, we're going to be covering that live as part of the nightly news.
[03:00:26.578 --> 03:00:28.739]  That'll begin at 7 Central, 8 p.m.
[03:00:28.739 --> 03:00:29.079]  Eastern.
[03:00:29.079 --> 03:00:31.040]  That's when our news broadcast begins.
[03:00:31.040 --> 03:00:34.001]  The debate will begin about a half hour into that broadcast, so we're going to pick it up.
[03:00:34.481 --> 03:00:36.541]  Cover it live like we did during the Money Bomb.
[03:00:36.541 --> 03:00:38.462]  We're going to have live comments.
[03:00:38.462 --> 03:00:41.282]  You'll also be able to contact us via Twitter.
[03:00:41.282 --> 03:00:45.203]  Hashtag DemDebate.
[03:00:45.203 --> 03:00:48.064]  You'll be able to send us your questions, your comments.
[03:00:48.064 --> 03:00:57.686]  And we're going to take a look at it because, you know, it's interesting to see how CNN is talking about how differently they're going to cover this debate than they did the GOP debate.
[03:00:58.346 --> 03:01:01.388]  CNN, Anderson Cooper will be the moderator this time.
[03:01:01.388 --> 03:01:06.312]  They had Jake Tapper moderate the last GOP debate, which was on CNN.
[03:01:06.312 --> 03:01:12.336]  Anderson Cooper says he's not going to try to mix this up and pit one candidate against another.
[03:01:12.336 --> 03:01:13.637]  Well, we are.
[03:01:13.637 --> 03:01:15.498]  We're going to pit them against their records.
[03:01:15.498 --> 03:01:19.361]  We're going to pit them against themselves, essentially, as well as against each other.
[03:01:19.361 --> 03:01:21.603]  I think it might be more interesting than people think.
[03:01:22.270 --> 03:01:28.817]  I don't think Bernie Sanders is going to rock the boat, and I think Hillary Clinton is going to play it pretty safe, unless somebody gets her mad.
[03:01:28.817 --> 03:01:36.385]  But I think that you've got three candidates there, two of them especially, Webb and O'Malley, who are pretty intelligent.
[03:01:36.385 --> 03:01:43.173]  I think they will come out swinging because they realize that from a horse race standpoint, this is essential for their survival.
[03:01:43.829 --> 03:01:49.596]  We had a DNC officer say she was disinvited from this particular debate because she had asked for more of them.
[03:01:49.596 --> 03:01:52.118]  They're only going to have six Democrat debates.
[03:01:52.118 --> 03:01:54.121]  It's a very, very controlled process.
[03:01:54.121 --> 03:01:59.887]  So we're going to talk about that, but we've got other things that we want to talk about as well, because you know there's a race coming up for the House Speaker.
[03:02:01.010 --> 03:02:11.599]  Interesting to see how this has developed, because remember back during the summer before they went on recess, Mark Meadows from North Carolina introduced a motion for Boehner to vacate the seat.
[03:02:11.599 --> 03:02:13.901]  They laughed about it, said, oh, that's not going to go anywhere.
[03:02:13.901 --> 03:02:17.784]  Then they counted heads and they realized he could very well lose that motion.
[03:02:17.784 --> 03:02:18.905]  So they tabled it.
[03:02:18.905 --> 03:02:22.728]  They went to recess and twisted some arms, found out they still couldn't do it.
[03:02:22.728 --> 03:02:28.854]  So Boehner abruptly announced his resignation or his retirement after meeting with the Pope.
[03:02:29.676 --> 03:02:32.578]  Then they came up to the point where they had an election scheduled.
[03:02:32.578 --> 03:02:37.301]  It was a private election which would precede the general election on the floor.
[03:02:37.301 --> 03:02:44.545]  They were going to select a Republican candidate so they could not be divided when they went to the floor because it's possible that a Democrat could get elected.
[03:02:44.545 --> 03:02:46.687]  If you divide it up between several Republicans.
[03:02:47.487 --> 03:02:53.449]  At that meeting, the frontrunner, as you probably know by now, Kevin McCarthy, stood up and abruptly resigned.
[03:02:53.449 --> 03:02:58.671]  At that point, Boehner stopped the meeting, there was wailing heard, and he said, we're not going to have the election.
[03:02:58.671 --> 03:03:00.531]  Now, there were two candidates there.
[03:03:00.531 --> 03:03:02.352]  How do you get away with doing something like that?
[03:03:02.352 --> 03:03:05.393]  I think that shows exactly what the problem is with Boehner.
[03:03:06.212 --> 03:03:07.953]  With government in general.
[03:03:07.953 --> 03:03:10.475]  Boehner acts exactly like a dictator.
[03:03:10.475 --> 03:03:12.316]  We talk about Obama acting like a dictator.
[03:03:12.316 --> 03:03:13.477]  Yes, he does.
[03:03:13.477 --> 03:03:15.358]  Executive orders, doing whatever he pleases.
[03:03:15.358 --> 03:03:17.860]  He says he's going to go around Congress.
[03:03:17.860 --> 03:03:21.743]  He doesn't want to wait for them to do this or that, so he's not going to go through the process of that.
[03:03:21.743 --> 03:03:28.888]  We see that the Congress has said they don't want to bother with the process of ratifying a treaty, so they pass the Fast Track Trade Authority.
[03:03:30.649 --> 03:03:36.131]  Now we've got Boehner saying, if you don't have my candidate in there, we're going to just stop the election.
[03:03:36.131 --> 03:03:40.612]  I will stay in office until I get a hand-picked candidate that I want.
[03:03:40.612 --> 03:03:42.113]  Is that the kind of government we want?
[03:03:42.113 --> 03:03:44.854]  I mean, this is absolutely amazing to me.
[03:03:44.854 --> 03:03:47.475]  He had two other candidates, and he just stops the election.
[03:03:48.467 --> 03:03:51.129]  So we're going to take a look at what's going on with some of these other candidates.
[03:03:51.129 --> 03:03:54.350]  Of course, the one that he wants is Paul Ryan.
[03:03:54.350 --> 03:04:03.256]  And he's putting out his demands, his lists, about how he wants to be presented the job without any conditions, without any questions about anything that he does.
[03:04:03.256 --> 03:04:07.538]  Essentially, he wants to be fast-tracked, just like the trade agreements.
[03:04:07.538 --> 03:04:08.399]  That's what he's demanding.
[03:04:08.959 --> 03:04:14.921]  When Drudge linked to the article, and I think the article is still linked up on Drudge, he basically called him, you know, a king.
[03:04:14.921 --> 03:04:19.003]  He's acting as if he's an heir apparent to the throne, and that's the way they're acting.
[03:04:19.003 --> 03:04:22.604]  I think they need to revive this motion to vacate the chair.
[03:04:22.604 --> 03:04:24.525]  They need to say, hey, we need to call a vote on this.
[03:04:24.525 --> 03:04:25.105]  What's going on?
[03:04:25.805 --> 03:04:27.245]  So we're going to take a look at that as well.
[03:04:27.245 --> 03:04:30.766]  There's also some interesting spy tech that's coming up.
[03:04:30.766 --> 03:04:36.048]  DARPA has a project called the Icarus Project for their drones.
[03:04:36.048 --> 03:04:36.928]  It's very ominous.
[03:04:36.928 --> 03:04:38.729]  We're going to talk about what's behind that.
[03:04:38.729 --> 03:04:45.511]  At the same time, Google is saying that they're now going to start putting sensors on their robot cars.
[03:04:45.511 --> 03:04:47.931]  Not their robot cars, but the ones that are mapping out the cars.
[03:04:47.931 --> 03:04:53.193]  They're going to put sensors on those cars to measure pollution, all the way down to cigarette smoke.
[03:04:53.833 --> 03:04:55.194]  See, that's where this is headed.
[03:04:55.194 --> 03:04:58.315]  Not just control of transportation, it's a complete surveillance grid.
[03:04:58.315 --> 03:04:59.476]  Stay with us, we'll be right back.
[03:04:59.476 --> 03:05:07.280]  Presidential candidates today strategize over every last detail of a candidate's image, especially an identity candidate like Hillary.
[03:05:07.280 --> 03:05:11.702]  How important is it for there to be a woman president in the United States?
[03:05:11.702 --> 03:05:17.905]  National Journal has pointed out that candidates now view soundtracks as a key part of that carefully crafted image.
[03:05:18.883 --> 03:05:23.292]  So, maybe Hillary should choose a campaign song that plays against type.
[03:05:23.292 --> 03:05:24.474]  You know, Humble.
[03:05:27.341 --> 03:05:33.866]  Hillary has paid a consulting firm $9,000 to create a soundtrack for her campaign.
[03:05:33.866 --> 03:05:37.168]  I just don't think people would believe this song, though.
[03:05:37.168 --> 03:05:43.452]  She's being abandoned by unions, by multinational corporate donors who are worried.
[03:05:43.452 --> 03:05:47.655]  44% of her Twitter followers, 1.4 million, are fake.
[03:05:47.655 --> 03:05:51.098]  Maybe her campaign theme should be... Help!
[03:05:51.098 --> 03:05:52.219]  I need somebody!
[03:05:52.219 --> 03:05:53.299]  Help!
[03:05:53.299 --> 03:05:54.981]  Not just anybody!
[03:05:54.981 --> 03:05:56.862]  For InfoWars.com, I'm David Knight.
[03:05:59.332 --> 03:06:05.055]  Your liver can be full of fatty deposits, built-up toxins, and even dangerous objects known as liver stones.
[03:06:05.055 --> 03:06:19.501]  We worked with the top developers in the field of detox to take tried and true herbs and other compounds known to safely cleanse the liver and fuse it with the latest research and technological development on concentrating these ingredients to give you the maximum effect.
[03:06:19.761 --> 03:06:27.763]  Liver Shield is the only liver support product on the market that uses a patented Spigerex blend of powerful organic herbs that support detoxification.
[03:06:27.763 --> 03:06:33.244]  And when you visit InfoWarsLife.com, see the instructional video on how to do a six-day liver detox.
[03:06:33.244 --> 03:06:36.905]  This isn't a game, and let me tell you, the results are dramatic.
[03:06:36.905 --> 03:06:41.026]  Liver Shield is totally organic and made of the safest, high-quality herbs.
[03:06:41.026 --> 03:06:44.907]  But that said, you need to consult your physician before you do the full detox.
[03:06:45.347 --> 03:06:49.470]  Liver Shield can also be used daily by itself for overall upkeep of the liver.
[03:06:49.470 --> 03:06:54.534]  Secure your Liver Shield today exclusively at Infowarslife.com for the lowest price available.

[03:06:59.177 --> 03:07:03.480]  Many of the products at Infowarslife.com are true game changers.
[03:07:03.480 --> 03:07:04.741]  They are compounds.
[03:07:04.821 --> 03:07:05.081]  We're good.
[03:07:33.339 --> 03:07:38.944]  You're getting a high quality product that has absolutely changed my life and many other people's lives that I know.
[03:07:38.944 --> 03:07:42.247]  And the final reason to try X2 is that it's so hard to keep in stock.
[03:07:42.247 --> 03:07:46.431]  We ordered the biggest shipment ever six months ago and that is about to sell out.
[03:07:46.431 --> 03:07:48.753]  It may be a month or two until more comes in.
[03:07:48.753 --> 03:07:55.719]  I want to challenge all of you in the next week to stock up on Survival Shield X2 today at Infowarslife.com or by calling 888-253-3139.
[03:08:01.946 --> 03:08:04.187]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[03:08:04.187 --> 03:08:09.991]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:08:09.991 --> 03:08:13.213]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:08:13.213 --> 03:08:15.255]  I'm David Knight, your host on this fourth hour.
[03:08:15.255 --> 03:08:22.980]  We're going to look at the news wrap-up and we're going to talk a little bit about what's coming up tonight with the first of only six Democrat debates.
[03:08:22.980 --> 03:08:25.742]  People are anxiously waiting to see what's going to happen.
[03:08:26.707 --> 03:08:27.007]  Maybe.
[03:08:27.007 --> 03:08:29.910]  I don't know if anybody's going to be watching it.
[03:08:29.910 --> 03:08:32.873]  But I think there's going to be something to watch, quite frankly.
[03:08:32.873 --> 03:08:37.999]  I think that there's going to be some candidates, O'Malley and Webb, who are absolutely desperate.
[03:08:37.999 --> 03:08:39.340]  They will come out swinging.
[03:08:39.340 --> 03:08:45.546]  I don't think that Sanders is much of a fighter when you look at what happened with Black Lives Matter.
[03:08:46.167 --> 03:08:48.009]  He really didn't.
[03:08:48.009 --> 03:08:49.271]  He's kind of very passive.
[03:08:49.271 --> 03:08:59.622]  I don't know, maybe he doesn't have really any hardcore things that he believes in, because quite frankly, if you believe in something enough, I can't see how you can be that passive about it.
[03:08:59.622 --> 03:09:02.525]  But maybe he will wake up tonight and say something.
[03:09:02.525 --> 03:09:03.746]  But I think the other candidates will.
[03:09:03.746 --> 03:09:05.829]  I think that if they don't, they're finished.
[03:09:06.249 --> 03:09:10.514]  They can stick a fork in it because they're already at essentially zero percent.
[03:09:10.514 --> 03:09:14.979]  But we have some interesting candidates that are going to come up and we're going to be covering it live.
[03:09:14.979 --> 03:09:16.260]  We're going to have our comments.
[03:09:16.260 --> 03:09:18.563]  We're going to be comparing what they say to what they've said before.
[03:09:19.232 --> 03:09:27.579]  We're going to be comparing what they say they will do to the Constitution, and we're going to talk a little bit about that, and you'll be able to join us with hashtag DemDebate.
[03:09:27.579 --> 03:09:42.231]  We're also going to talk in this hour about some developments in the House Speaker race, because I think it's absolutely appalling that John Boehner could just suspend an election, and it's still suspended, ignoring the motion to vacate the chair.
[03:09:42.231 --> 03:09:44.433]  This is the kind of authoritarian dictatorship
[03:09:44.973 --> 03:09:48.136]  That he has established there, that's why there's rebellion against him.
[03:09:48.136 --> 03:09:54.943]  It isn't simply about the fact that they make promises to the electorate that they have no intention of following through with.
[03:09:54.943 --> 03:09:59.407]  It is also the way that he conducts himself as a petty tyrant and a dictator.
[03:10:00.247 --> 03:10:02.288]  So we're going to take a look at that as well.
[03:10:02.288 --> 03:10:08.352]  As well as some really creepy new technology that's coming from DARPA and from Google.
[03:10:08.352 --> 03:10:13.735]  DARPA wants a drone program that will vanish into thin air after they use it.
[03:10:13.735 --> 03:10:18.198]  They call it Project Icarus and we're going to talk about what's involved with that.
[03:10:18.198 --> 03:10:20.960]  Why would the Defense Department want something like that?
[03:10:21.755 --> 03:10:36.767]  Based on what we have seen recently with the bombing of a hospital, with the assassinations continuously of drones, I can imagine a lot of reasons why our government, the way they conduct themselves abroad, why they would want something that would disappear like a Mission Impossible message machine.
[03:10:37.463 --> 03:10:40.486]  Disavowing any knowledge or any presence that they've been there before.
[03:10:40.486 --> 03:10:43.168]  That's precisely what they're looking at with this device.
[03:10:43.168 --> 03:10:50.175]  Also, Google wants to start using its cars not just map streets, but to map pollution levels.
[03:10:50.175 --> 03:10:55.200]  And this brings up the whole issue of information sharing between corporations.
[03:10:55.200 --> 03:10:59.224]  Spying on you, using total surveillance, passing that information on to the government.
[03:10:59.884 --> 03:11:03.208]  And then using that to establish a total control grid.
[03:11:03.208 --> 03:11:04.429]  So we're going to talk about both of those.
[03:11:04.429 --> 03:11:10.536]  Before I get into the news, however, I want to let you know that we've extended our sale on InfoWars storable foods.
[03:11:10.536 --> 03:11:17.903]  Right now at InfoWarsStore.com you can get 10% off InfoWars select storable foods and free shipping.

[03:11:25.105 --> 03:11:28.426]  All these ingredients are made in the USA, even the packaging.
[03:11:28.426 --> 03:11:30.306]  It's set to last for 25 years.
[03:11:30.306 --> 03:11:32.507]  We have the best packaging in the industry.
[03:11:32.507 --> 03:11:36.067]  We use military-grade barriers against light, oxygen and moisture.
[03:11:36.067 --> 03:11:37.948]  They are resealable pouches.
[03:11:37.948 --> 03:11:43.169]  It's truly the lowest price we can give you under contract with the manufacturer for the highest quality storable food we know of.

[03:11:54.616 --> 03:11:57.879]  Alright, let's talk about this technology first before we go to politics.
[03:11:57.879 --> 03:12:00.100]  Because this is something that I think is very, very dangerous.
[03:12:00.100 --> 03:12:07.425]  And we always need to understand that they're going to sell the DARPA technology to us as something that is going to be beneficial to all mankind.
[03:12:07.425 --> 03:12:07.886]  Okay?
[03:12:07.886 --> 03:12:11.208]  This is like the aliens in the Twilight Zone who come to Earth
[03:12:11.668 --> 03:12:15.731]  And they've got this book to serve mankind, and then you find out at the end it's a cookbook?
[03:12:15.731 --> 03:12:17.573]  Okay, that's precisely what this is about.
[03:12:17.573 --> 03:12:21.055]  DARPA is about creating weapons, folks.
[03:12:21.055 --> 03:12:22.096]  It's about creating weapons.
[03:12:22.096 --> 03:12:24.638]  They have always been a part of the weapons system.
[03:12:25.744 --> 03:12:32.325]  We had an excellent interview with a lady who is the author of Anne Jacobson who wrote The Pentagon Brain.
[03:12:32.325 --> 03:12:34.086]  I would recommend that book to you.
[03:12:34.086 --> 03:12:36.226]  It puts all of this in a historical context.
[03:12:36.226 --> 03:12:46.028]  You can see what these people have been doing for 60 plus years after the Operation Paperclip where they brought German scientists over and just see how this has gone off the rails.
[03:12:46.028 --> 03:12:47.768]  But here's the latest example of this.
[03:12:47.768 --> 03:12:50.168]  DARPA wants drones that will vanish into thin air.
[03:12:50.168 --> 03:12:53.669]  They call it Project Icarus and they've even got their own little acronym here.
[03:12:53.849 --> 03:12:54.610]  So cute.
[03:12:54.610 --> 03:12:55.930]  They always do this.
[03:12:55.930 --> 03:12:59.593]  Inbound, controlled, air-releasable, unrecoverable systems.
[03:12:59.593 --> 03:13:06.557]  And they say, and this is a story from Popular Science, and they always like to put a happy spin on all these grim technology stories.
[03:13:07.529 --> 03:13:12.173]  I would like to say this is expendable single-use drones that can carry supplies to those in need.
[03:13:12.173 --> 03:13:13.634]  Because that's what they're going to be doing.
[03:13:13.634 --> 03:13:16.776]  They're going to be giving food to the soldiers in the field.
[03:13:16.776 --> 03:13:18.037]  Well, they may do some of that.
[03:13:18.037 --> 03:13:22.000]  But if you're just doing that, why do you need to have this thing disappear?
[03:13:22.000 --> 03:13:26.303]  Well, they say it's a real hassle to bring the stuff back.
[03:13:26.303 --> 03:13:26.844]  Really?
[03:13:26.844 --> 03:13:28.345]  Is that really what you need it for?
[03:13:28.345 --> 03:13:29.926]  Listen to the way that it's going to disappear.
[03:13:31.067 --> 03:13:43.794]  Naming it after Icarus, they're referring consciously to the Greek mythology figure, the guy who got wings of wax and he flew too close to the sun, the wings melted and he crashed to the earth.
[03:13:43.794 --> 03:13:44.774]  And that's what they're looking for.
[03:13:44.774 --> 03:13:49.637]  But they're looking for a drone that will vanish within four hours of delivery to its target.
[03:13:50.819 --> 03:14:00.365]  Or within 30 minutes of twilight, and as even popular science points out, it makes the drone as much of a vampire as a robot.
[03:14:00.365 --> 03:14:01.166]  Okay?
[03:14:01.166 --> 03:14:03.748]  So that's what you're looking at.
[03:14:03.748 --> 03:14:13.875]  You know, when they have all these projects of robots and everything, it's not so that they can go in and control a nuclear emergency at a plant like Fukushima.
[03:14:13.875 --> 03:14:15.356]  Yeah, it could be used for something like that.
[03:14:15.976 --> 03:14:17.597]  But they're creating these robots.
[03:14:17.597 --> 03:14:20.099]  They've got in mind a Terminator system.
[03:14:20.099 --> 03:14:22.842]  They've got in mind autonomous killing machines.
[03:14:22.842 --> 03:14:24.763]  That's where they're headed with all this stuff.
[03:14:24.763 --> 03:14:27.245]  They're headed to an arms race with that.
[03:14:27.245 --> 03:14:43.938]  But when we look at this drone thing, especially in light of the most recent atrocity from the Obama administration, where they continually attack the hospital for 30 minutes, and I've mentioned this many times and I think we really need to hammer this hypocrisy from Obama, that two days after the shooting in Oregon,
[03:14:44.741 --> 03:14:49.824]  His military shoots up a hospital that people knew about for quite a long time.
[03:14:49.824 --> 03:14:52.166]  They've been notified repeatedly about this.
[03:14:52.166 --> 03:14:54.687]  They've been given the GPS coordinates about it.
[03:14:54.687 --> 03:14:57.829]  And they had been notified just a couple of days before this happened.
[03:14:57.829 --> 03:15:01.111]  And as it was happening, it wasn't a single bomb that landed on this hospital.
[03:15:01.111 --> 03:15:04.333]  It was under continuous attack for 30 minutes.
[03:15:04.333 --> 03:15:12.959]  30 minutes while they called both the Afghan and the Pentagon, the Afghan government and the Pentagon, telling them that they were under attack.
[03:15:14.093 --> 03:15:17.674]  This is a war crime when you deliberately target hospitals.
[03:15:17.674 --> 03:15:21.436]  And of course we got a different answer every day from the Pentagon.
[03:15:21.436 --> 03:15:30.400]  Now they have finally come out and said, well, we're going to pay the families, but we're not going to give you any details about how this happened or what we might possibly do to change it.
[03:15:30.400 --> 03:15:32.541]  So rather than investigate this, because
[03:15:33.806 --> 03:15:41.894]  Doctors Without Borders is not trying to do what I think they ought to do, and that is go for a war crimes investigation.
[03:15:41.894 --> 03:15:45.597]  They're simply saying, we would like to open up an investigation to see how this happened.
[03:15:45.597 --> 03:15:46.598]  We'd like an explanation.
[03:15:47.409 --> 03:15:49.090]  Obama can't be bothered.
[03:15:49.090 --> 03:15:51.291]  Obama won't travel to the area.
[03:15:51.291 --> 03:15:53.612]  He won't do any kind of an investigation.
[03:15:53.612 --> 03:15:58.894]  They're stonewalling on this other than saying that they're going to give them money, but they're not going to admit that they did anything wrong.
[03:15:58.894 --> 03:16:08.558]  Meanwhile, Obama goes to Oregon and grandstands over a shooting that happened from one individual who was most likely, from everything we've seen, hyped up on drugs.
[03:16:09.554 --> 03:16:11.175]  This is the way they roll.
[03:16:11.175 --> 03:16:13.536]  This is the hypocrisy with which they roll.
[03:16:13.536 --> 03:16:19.420]  And of course, that's why they would like to have a drone that would disappear because they're doing open assassinations.
[03:16:19.420 --> 03:16:30.087]  You remember back in the 1960s and 70s, it was absolutely outrageous during the church hearings when the CIA admitted that they were involved in assassination attempts.
[03:16:30.087 --> 03:16:33.189]  That they had these specialized guns that could not be traced.
[03:16:34.264 --> 03:16:37.387]  That would shoot the bullet and the bullet would dissolve.
[03:16:37.387 --> 03:16:51.120]  Now we have a government that openly engages in drone assassinations and openly talks about the fact that it isn't necessarily the bullet that's going to dissolve, but the delivery vehicle is going to dissolve, so they can't trace it back to them.
[03:16:51.120 --> 03:16:54.344]  That's the kind of criminal mindset of these people.
[03:16:54.344 --> 03:16:56.486]  Now when we talk about things dissolving like vampires,
[03:16:57.759 --> 03:17:04.950]  We need to realize that in the past we've had Manning, who went to jail, exposing videos of the U.S.
[03:17:04.950 --> 03:17:10.920]  military attacking innocent civilians and then shooting up the ambulance when it came and laughing about it.
[03:17:11.701 --> 03:17:12.561]  We've talked about that.
[03:17:12.561 --> 03:17:13.742]  We've shown that video.
[03:17:13.742 --> 03:17:16.863]  That got the Pentagon so angry that they put Manning in jail.
[03:17:16.863 --> 03:17:23.265]  They tried to frame, I believe, Julian Assange, and they've been surrounding him at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London for over three years.
[03:17:23.265 --> 03:17:27.406]  Spent over $15 million in putting a police cordon there 24-7, 365.
[03:17:30.427 --> 03:17:33.130]  Now they are just pulling back.
[03:17:33.130 --> 03:17:35.592]  But they have this interesting statement.
[03:17:35.592 --> 03:17:49.025]  They said, officers remain committed to executing the arrest warrant against Julian Assange and presenting him before the court, and they vowed to deploy a number of overt and covert tactics to arrest him.
[03:17:49.025 --> 03:17:49.786]  So there you go.
[03:17:49.786 --> 03:17:54.811]  They're going to not be visible, but that's the way they're going to take this.
[03:17:56.089 --> 03:18:01.093]  Finally, I want to talk about in terms of our secret government here.
[03:18:01.093 --> 03:18:06.097]  There was an accident that happened this weekend, and I really think you should take a look at these pictures.
[03:18:06.097 --> 03:18:07.778]  This is on the Daily Mail this weekend.
[03:18:07.778 --> 03:18:14.583]  It's a couple of teenagers, 17 and 15, lost control of their Mercedes in the wee hours of the morning on Saturday, and both died.
[03:18:14.583 --> 03:18:16.825]  The car crashed at high speed into a tree.
[03:18:16.825 --> 03:18:18.406]  Does that sound familiar?
[03:18:18.406 --> 03:18:20.328]  A Mercedes crashing into a tree at high speed?
[03:18:20.988 --> 03:18:23.468]  Do you remember the death of Michael Hastings?
[03:18:23.468 --> 03:18:25.989]  Do you remember when we said that it couldn't happen like that?
[03:18:25.989 --> 03:18:28.769]  It wouldn't look like that if they crashed into a tree?
[03:18:28.769 --> 03:18:35.411]  Well, you can see what it looks like when a Mercedes C350, the exact same model that Hastings had.
[03:18:35.411 --> 03:18:37.011]  Actually, the engine is different.
[03:18:37.011 --> 03:18:40.051]  The C350 that they were driving is a six-cylinder engine.
[03:18:40.051 --> 03:18:44.312]  He had a 250, which is a four-cylinder turbocharged.
[03:18:44.312 --> 03:18:45.932]  But it's the same vehicle.
[03:18:45.932 --> 03:18:48.093]  Look at how that disintegrated.
[03:18:48.093 --> 03:18:49.293]  Notice there was no fire.
[03:18:49.953 --> 03:18:54.115]  Notice that the engine wasn't ejected at a right angle when it struck the tree.
[03:18:54.115 --> 03:18:55.975]  Rather, the car was cut into half.
[03:18:55.975 --> 03:18:56.915]  Okay?
[03:18:56.915 --> 03:19:00.117]  You don't eject the engine when you hit a tree.
[03:19:00.117 --> 03:19:02.457]  You capture the engine into the car.
[03:19:02.457 --> 03:19:06.079]  If you're going to have a fire, it's necessary for the rear end to be compromised.
[03:19:06.079 --> 03:19:07.479]  Remember the Pinto?
[03:19:07.479 --> 03:19:11.941]  Rear end fires, they burst into flames because the rear end was not protected.
[03:19:11.941 --> 03:19:18.103]  When you look at the pictures, and you can see that one picture, all the devastation is right there at the passenger level.
[03:19:19.161 --> 03:19:30.287]  And we said at the time it was possible that the car could have been hijacked, it could have been driven at high speed, it could have then been blown up down the road, that would cause the engine to eject down the road, and then the car to turn into that tree.
[03:19:30.287 --> 03:19:34.309]  Because you look at that, where that hit that tree, it's not crashed.
[03:19:34.309 --> 03:19:44.434]  So take a look, go to the internet, take a look at this, take a look at the pictures of Michael Hastings, go to the Daily Mail story, take a look at that car, and ask yourself if we're crazy conspiracy theorists.
[03:19:45.234 --> 03:19:48.895]  It's just like the buildings that didn't fall down.
[03:19:48.895 --> 03:19:52.076]  All the skyscrapers, they don't fall down when they catch fire, folks.
[03:19:52.076 --> 03:19:53.876]  They're designed not to do that.
[03:19:53.876 --> 03:19:57.557]  And you don't, you can't fly planes at that speed, at that level.
[03:19:57.557 --> 03:20:00.598]  And we had three buildings that fell down, supposedly two planes.
[03:20:00.598 --> 03:20:01.378]  Stay with us, we'll be right back.
[03:20:01.378 --> 03:20:04.139]  Do you worry about the health and safety of you and your loved ones?
[03:20:04.139 --> 03:20:08.220]  Do you wonder what would happen if you weren't able to get to a hospital or doctor?
[03:20:08.220 --> 03:20:13.281]  How can you keep your family safe against the deadly pathogens that are beginning to emerge in the world today?

[03:20:28.831 --> 03:20:29.411]  Supernatural Silver

[03:22:59.458 --> 03:23:03.882]  Most of us already know that taking a fish oil supplement to boost omega-3s is a good idea.
[03:23:03.882 --> 03:23:07.946]  But did you know that about 60% of Americans are actually deficient in omega-3s?
[03:23:07.946 --> 03:23:12.170]  Did you know that most fish oil products contain only about 25% omega-3s and the remaining 75% is undesirable fish fat?
[03:23:15.293 --> 03:23:20.535]  Heck, did you know that more than 90% of fish oil supplements sold in the USA are not even made here?
[03:23:20.535 --> 03:23:29.239]  If you want to boost your Omega-3s using the finest American-made fish oil, check out Nutrigold fish oil supplements on www.fishoil.best.

[03:23:56.614 --> 03:24:05.641]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:24:10.302 --> 03:24:11.523]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:24:11.523 --> 03:24:15.527]  I'm David Knight, your host in this fourth hour on this Tuesday, October 13, 2015.
[03:24:15.527 --> 03:24:20.111]  Tonight is going to be the first of only six Democrat debates.
[03:24:20.111 --> 03:24:29.140]  And I say only because Debbie Wasserman Schultz, who is an unshakable ally of Hillary Clinton, basically is not going to change anything.
[03:24:29.660 --> 03:24:36.308]  She punished one lady, a representative congresswoman from Hawaii, who said that she thought there ought to be more debates.
[03:24:36.308 --> 03:24:38.271]  She was disinvited from the debate.
[03:24:38.271 --> 03:24:48.824]  She'll be watching that at home in Hawaii because, you know, you just don't push back against the power brokers in Washington, whether it's the Democrats like Wasserman Schultz or whether it's Republicans like John Boehner.
[03:24:49.444 --> 03:24:53.866]  This is a dictatorship of the leadership in charge.
[03:24:53.866 --> 03:24:58.467]  Now we had an article up yesterday about the dismal Democrat debate by Kurt Nemo.
[03:24:58.467 --> 03:25:07.351]  We had some interesting quotes in there from John Whitehead pointing out that really this is not going to change things in America.
[03:25:07.351 --> 03:25:13.113]  But I think it's very important to be aware of what's going on because you need to know the direction that we're going.
[03:25:13.653 --> 03:25:17.697]  You need to understand where the people who want to take your freedoms are going.
[03:25:17.697 --> 03:25:19.838]  That's one of the reasons to watch this.
[03:25:19.838 --> 03:25:25.523]  He says the American people remain eager to be persuaded that a new president in the White House can solve the problems that plague us.
[03:25:25.523 --> 03:25:31.588]  Yet no matter who wins this next presidential election, you can rest assured the new boss will be same as the old boss.
[03:25:32.469 --> 03:25:41.599]  We, the permanent underclass in America, will continue to be forced to march in lockstep with the police state and, in all matters, public and private.
[03:25:41.599 --> 03:25:42.880]  That's John W. Whitehead.
[03:25:42.880 --> 03:25:49.087]  He says establishment presidential candidates from Clinton to Bush and the rest of the single digiters are show horses for the 1% elite.
[03:25:50.328 --> 03:26:07.565]  Those who are the controllers, the masterminds, the shadow government, the police state, the surveillance state, the military-industrial complex, understand that no matter which party occupies the White House in 2017, the unelected bureaucracy that actually calls the shots will continue to call the shots.
[03:26:07.565 --> 03:26:12.891]  That's why I say when we look at these presidential elections, it really is like being presented with a red pill and a blue pill.
[03:26:13.792 --> 03:26:16.315]  Except that they're both placebos.
[03:26:16.315 --> 03:26:21.760]  They're both there to make you feel that you're going to accomplish something, that you're participating in something.
[03:26:21.760 --> 03:26:36.095]  You need to be able, that's why we have this permanent entrenched bureaucracy that the Congress has abdicated their authority to, and that's why I think our efforts need to be focused, need to be focused at the local level where we can shut down.
[03:26:36.656 --> 03:26:37.036]  That's right.
[03:26:55.493 --> 03:26:59.414]  You can follow this with hashtag DemDebate.
[03:26:59.414 --> 03:27:01.315]  You can make comments and questions to us.
[03:27:01.315 --> 03:27:04.836]  We're going to be commenting on this debate as it moves along.
[03:27:04.836 --> 03:27:11.898]  We're going to be comparing what they say to what they've said before and to what the Constitution says and what we want to see happen.
[03:27:11.898 --> 03:27:21.321]  Understand, too, that with the Democrats, you're going to get a more honest presentation of where they want the big centralized government to go than you're going to get with Republicans.
[03:27:21.781 --> 03:27:27.544]  The Republicans are always going to pay lip service to small government unless it's on foreign policy.
[03:27:27.544 --> 03:27:33.967]  There they want the American empire that's going to basically go abroad and kick butt, okay?
[03:27:33.967 --> 03:27:36.269]  And no limits on what it's going to do.
[03:27:36.269 --> 03:27:39.930]  But on most other issues they will talk about a small government.
[03:27:39.930 --> 03:27:41.151]  They don't really mean it.
[03:27:41.151 --> 03:27:42.232]  We've seen this from Boehner.
[03:27:42.232 --> 03:27:45.113]  We've seen it from all the leadership of the Republican Party.
[03:27:47.290 --> 03:27:52.896]  With the Democrats, you are going to see what they really want to do, where they really want to go.
[03:27:52.896 --> 03:28:01.044]  You need to watch it, because you need to get yourself scared and fired up to do something, not necessarily about the presidential race, but something at the local level.
[03:28:01.809 --> 03:28:11.936]  Now, when we look at what's going on tonight in terms of just the sheer horse race aspects of it, the politics of it, of course, Joe Biden is not going to be there tonight, but I certainly expect him to be jumping in.
[03:28:11.936 --> 03:28:18.940]  He will probably wait until after the debate so that he can steal the thunder from whoever may rise up from it.
[03:28:18.940 --> 03:28:24.724]  He may even announce during the debate, who knows, but CNN is basically begging him to show up.
[03:28:24.724 --> 03:28:31.249]  They even tweeted out a picture of the podium and said, wait, if Joe jumps in, we've got a podium already set up for him.
[03:28:31.969 --> 03:28:41.132]  But it's also going to be interesting that CNN has already announced through Anderson Cooper that they're not going to pit the Democrats against each other tonight like they did the Republicans.
[03:28:41.132 --> 03:28:48.534]  You remember how Jake Tapper would go in and he would say, well, you know, Donald Trump said this about you.
[03:28:48.534 --> 03:28:49.734]  What do you think about that?
[03:28:49.734 --> 03:28:53.436]  I mean, it was like some kind of reality TV show.
[03:28:53.436 --> 03:28:57.597]  Like I said, it's like Celebrity Big Brother, where they mentioned
[03:28:58.317 --> 03:29:00.739]  Individual digs that somebody has taken at each other.
[03:29:00.739 --> 03:29:04.322]  And it's not just Trump taking digs at other people, it's other people taking digs at Trump.
[03:29:04.322 --> 03:29:08.065]  And so it was constantly mixing it up with very, very petty questions.
[03:29:08.065 --> 03:29:13.830]  But of course, Anderson Cooper says, we're not going to do that with the Democrats, because these are all serious people.
[03:29:13.830 --> 03:29:15.811]  Because they're Democrats.
[03:29:15.811 --> 03:29:17.052]  They're serious.
[03:29:17.052 --> 03:29:20.215]  This is a serious debate, because it's a Democrat debate.
[03:29:20.755 --> 03:29:22.256]  And they want to talk about issues.
[03:29:22.256 --> 03:29:24.197]  I want to give them an opportunity to do that.
[03:29:24.197 --> 03:29:24.937]  Well, you know what?
[03:29:24.937 --> 03:29:27.518]  I think some of the minor candidates are pretty smart.
[03:29:27.518 --> 03:29:28.719]  I think they're going to come out swinging.
[03:29:28.719 --> 03:29:29.999]  I think it's going to be interesting.
[03:29:29.999 --> 03:29:31.360]  We're going to cover that tonight.
[03:29:31.360 --> 03:29:33.361]  Again, the hashtag is DemDebate.
[03:29:33.361 --> 03:29:35.481]  That coverage is going to start at 7.30.
[03:29:35.481 --> 03:29:42.665]  Our nightly news starts at 7.00 Central, and the coverage of the debate will go for two hours, beginning at 7.30 Central, 8.30 Eastern.
[03:29:42.665 --> 03:29:43.705]  Join us then.
[03:29:43.705 --> 03:29:47.326]  We're going to be right back with some more coverage of what Google is up to.
[03:29:47.326 --> 03:29:47.687]  Stay with us.
[03:29:47.687 --> 03:29:48.187]  We'll be right back.
[03:29:48.956 --> 03:29:52.889]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[03:29:52.889 --> 03:29:55.578]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:29:59.807 --> 03:30:05.872]  A paranoid professor quits UT after the university allows concealed carry.
[03:30:05.872 --> 03:30:18.203]  A University of Texas professor is quitting his job and moving from Austin to Australia because of the university's decision to allow students to carry concealed handguns on campus.
[03:30:18.203 --> 03:30:26.971]  Economics professor Daniel Hammermesh is now worried that a disgruntled student might bring a gun into the classroom and start shooting.
[03:30:27.131 --> 03:30:30.914]  The issue is not so much somebody coming into the classroom from the outside.
[03:30:30.914 --> 03:30:39.119]  It's rather a student in the classroom or more likely a student in my office who's upset about a grade and who pulls a gun on me.
[03:30:39.119 --> 03:30:40.060]  I'm not going to carry a gun.
[03:30:40.060 --> 03:30:41.801]  I don't want to be involved in a gun fight.
[03:30:41.801 --> 03:30:50.206]  So apparently paranoid professor Hammermesh would rather see his students left defenseless and unarmed in the events of an emergency.
[03:30:50.206 --> 03:30:54.309]  Will Von Boyage professor take your liberal logic and run?

[03:30:59.693 --> 03:31:00.934]  Another major health threat.
[03:31:00.934 --> 03:31:05.917]  This one in Toledo, Ohio, where everybody in the entire city has been told not to drink the water.
[03:31:05.917 --> 03:31:08.598]  Ohio's governor declaring a state of emergency.
[03:31:08.598 --> 03:31:15.643]  Did you know that the average person uses about 80 to 100 gallons of water at home every single day?
[03:31:15.643 --> 03:31:18.625]  If there's a water emergency, will you be prepared?
[03:31:18.625 --> 03:31:21.587]  Panicked residents forming long lines throughout the day.
[03:31:21.587 --> 03:31:23.608]  We're here at a supermarket in Toledo.
[03:31:23.608 --> 03:31:26.390]  You can see the shelves empty where water once was.
[03:31:26.510 --> 03:31:32.232]  To stay safe and healthy during a crisis, you must have access to safe, clean water.
[03:31:32.232 --> 03:31:35.753]  Water which will not be available at your local grocery store.
[03:31:35.753 --> 03:31:38.834]  There's a mad dash on right now to stock up on supplies.

[03:32:58.670 --> 03:33:06.372]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:06.372 --> 03:33:08.653]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[03:33:13.843 --> 03:33:15.666]  Welcome back to the fourth hour of the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:15.666 --> 03:33:16.829]  I'm David Knight, your host.
[03:33:16.829 --> 03:33:20.154]  As we were just talking in the last segment, we're going to be covering the Democrat debate.
[03:33:21.068 --> 03:33:27.289]  Live tonight with comments and the hashtag if you want to join us on that is going to be hashtag DemDebate.
[03:33:27.289 --> 03:33:30.710]  We'll be joining that about half hour after the nightly news begins.
[03:33:30.710 --> 03:33:36.611]  Leanne McAdoo will be hosting the nightly news and then we'll be covering live the Democrat debate with comments.
[03:33:36.611 --> 03:33:44.132]  And I want to go back and talk about exactly what some of the issues before them are and how they've adjusted their position on some vital issues.
[03:33:44.132 --> 03:33:47.753]  There's not too many issues that are really going to come up of any consequence.
[03:33:48.493 --> 03:33:54.641]  I believe, but of course there's going to be some, like the Trans-Pacific Partnership, that I think may play into this tonight.
[03:33:54.641 --> 03:33:56.724]  So it'll be interesting to hear back and forth about that.
[03:33:56.724 --> 03:34:03.612]  Perhaps this debate will serve the purpose of educating people as to the dangers of the Trans-Pacific Partnership.
[03:34:04.293 --> 03:34:10.421]  The only Democrat candidate who has come out saying that he would support that, and he's not a candidate yet officially.
[03:34:10.421 --> 03:34:12.564]  Joe is still biding his time.
[03:34:12.564 --> 03:34:18.432]  But Joe Biden is still in support of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the transatlantic partnerships.
[03:34:18.432 --> 03:34:21.095]  But Hillary Clinton has now flip-flopped on her position.
[03:34:21.956 --> 03:34:27.700]  And Sanders has been against it from the very beginning, so that might be one thing of substance that they may talk about tonight.
[03:34:27.700 --> 03:34:28.601]  We'll see what happens.
[03:34:28.601 --> 03:34:33.124]  Before we get back to that, I want to let you know that we now have a sale on Secret 12.
[03:34:33.124 --> 03:34:37.908]  Vitamin B12 is now 20% off at Infowarslife.com.
[03:34:37.908 --> 03:34:40.049]  20% off of B12.

[03:34:47.775 --> 03:34:48.496]  I take it every day.
[03:34:49.236 --> 03:34:52.438]  Every morning I take this and it's something that you can do as a supplement.
[03:34:52.438 --> 03:34:54.059]  You don't have to.
[03:34:54.059 --> 03:34:57.120]  It's available in a liquid form and that's one of the things I like.
[03:34:57.120 --> 03:35:00.622]  I like to take liquid supplements because I don't have a lot of pills to swallow.
[03:35:00.622 --> 03:35:06.105]  Again, experience the power of Ultra B12 with Secret 12 at Infowarslife.com.

[03:35:11.207 --> 03:35:14.432]  Getting back to the debate, what are the debate goals tonight?
[03:35:14.432 --> 03:35:18.417]  There's a lot of people saying, what do the candidates need to accomplish?
[03:35:18.417 --> 03:35:20.841]  Well of course Hillary Clinton needs to convince people that she's real.
[03:35:21.747 --> 03:35:29.028]  It's become such a joke that Rolling Stones last week said, there is no real Hillary Clinton.
[03:35:29.028 --> 03:35:33.909]  And what they were talking about, of course, was the way that she was flip-flopping on all these different issues.
[03:35:33.909 --> 03:35:45.392]  She had supported the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the Transatlantic Partnership, these secretly negotiated corporate deals that we still are not allowed to see, even though they say they finished it more than a week ago.
[03:35:45.392 --> 03:35:47.392]  The public is not allowed to see it.
[03:35:48.320 --> 03:35:52.142]  Only the corporations who wrote this are allowed to see it.
[03:35:52.142 --> 03:36:02.708]  Are you going to run as a candidate for a populist party and defend a secret trade agreement that was written by corporations that nobody is allowed to see?
[03:36:02.708 --> 03:36:05.810]  And of course, we know that it's about much more than trade.
[03:36:05.810 --> 03:36:06.930]  Far more than trade.
[03:36:06.930 --> 03:36:08.731]  But now she says she's against it.
[03:36:08.731 --> 03:36:11.853]  Just like she says she's now against the Keystone Pipeline.
[03:36:11.853 --> 03:36:15.375]  When in reality, Hillary Clinton and the State Department
[03:36:15.635 --> 03:36:19.897]  We're the only parts of the Obama administration that were for the Keystone Pipeline before.
[03:36:19.897 --> 03:36:22.438]  So now she's been on all these different sides of the issue.
[03:36:22.438 --> 03:36:35.624]  And again, as I've said before, my problem with the Keystone Pipeline is the fact that it involves the same kind of international, multinational, corporate cronyism that we see with these trade partnerships, so-called partnerships or treaties.
[03:36:36.363 --> 03:36:41.810]  They don't want to call them a treaty because they don't want to go through a constitutional process to approve a treaty, but they are treaties.
[03:36:41.810 --> 03:36:47.336]  With the Keystone Pipeline, they're going to allow a Canadian company to confiscate people's farms.
[03:36:48.379 --> 03:36:49.900]  With eminent domain.
[03:36:49.900 --> 03:36:51.700]  So they can run their pipeline through it.
[03:36:51.700 --> 03:36:53.761]  Sorry, that's a deal-breaker for me.
[03:36:53.761 --> 03:36:55.882]  It ought to be a deal-breaker for you.
[03:36:55.882 --> 03:37:00.984]  But I don't know what her opposition to Keystone is now that she says she opposes it.
[03:37:00.984 --> 03:37:02.845]  But that's why they were saying she wasn't real.
[03:37:02.845 --> 03:37:08.207]  Because, as they put it, she reinvents herself as often as you get a new model of phone.
[03:37:08.207 --> 03:37:10.188]  And that shouldn't be the case.
[03:37:10.188 --> 03:37:13.389]  But then, of course, yesterday there was on the Drudge Report another article
[03:37:13.649 --> 03:37:14.610]  Well, she made fun of that.
[03:37:14.610 --> 03:37:17.792]  She says, oh yes, I'm not really a human being.
[03:37:17.792 --> 03:37:20.734]  So we had at the top of the Drudge Report, I'm not really even a human being.
[03:37:20.734 --> 03:37:22.114]  She says, I'm a robot.
[03:37:22.114 --> 03:37:23.455]  I was created in a garage.
[03:37:23.455 --> 03:37:23.976]  And you know what?
[03:37:23.976 --> 03:37:25.857]  She's not artificial intelligence.
[03:37:25.857 --> 03:37:27.458]  Hillary is simply artificial.
[03:37:27.458 --> 03:37:31.841]  No matter how many times they want to put her on Saturday Night Live and sing with her,
[03:37:32.661 --> 03:37:37.085]  I mean, it just, it is, she's beyond phony and everybody realizes it.
[03:37:37.085 --> 03:37:39.007]  Even the Democrats realize it.
[03:37:39.007 --> 03:37:40.468]  So that's her challenge tonight.
[03:37:40.468 --> 03:37:41.889]  What is Bernie Sanders' challenge?
[03:37:41.889 --> 03:37:46.933]  Well, he's trying to reinvent himself to make himself more attractive to the Democrat mainstream.
[03:37:46.933 --> 03:37:50.757]  And of course, one of the things that he needs to do is to come around on gun control.
[03:37:51.437 --> 03:37:53.818]  Being from Vermont, he never really pushed it.
[03:37:53.818 --> 03:37:56.159]  And so now, he is.
[03:37:56.159 --> 03:38:05.644]  And he's reversed himself on gun control, just like Hillary has reversed herself on these trade deals on the Keystone Pipeline and multinational crony capitalism.
[03:38:05.644 --> 03:38:09.846]  Bernie Sanders is now showing his flexibility on gun control.
[03:38:09.846 --> 03:38:11.307]  That's the way the Wall Street Journal puts it.
[03:38:11.307 --> 03:38:14.569]  You know that conservative Republican paper?
[03:38:14.569 --> 03:38:18.911]  They come out and they say, Bernie Sanders signals flexibility on gun control.
[03:38:20.091 --> 03:38:31.795]  No, what he's signaling is that he is kowtowing to the Democrat orthodoxy, saying that he's going to destroy the Second Amendment, when before he wouldn't do that.
[03:38:31.795 --> 03:38:40.338]  So if you say that you're going to destroy people's inalienable rights that are guaranteed in the Constitution, the Wall Street Journal calls that flexibility.
[03:38:40.338 --> 03:38:43.880]  Listen to what he said on Meet the Press on Sunday.
[03:38:43.880 --> 03:38:44.180]  He says,
[03:38:45.120 --> 03:38:55.772]  Is there evidence that gun manufacturers do know that they're selling a whole lot of guns in an area that really should not be buying that many guns?
[03:38:55.772 --> 03:39:00.357]  That many guns are going to these areas probably for criminal purposes?
[03:39:00.357 --> 03:39:01.057]  That's what he said!
[03:39:01.886 --> 03:39:03.987]  That's what he said on Meet the Press on Sunday.
[03:39:03.987 --> 03:39:05.267]  That's what Bernie Sanders said.
[03:39:05.267 --> 03:39:16.911]  So he says, you know, if you're a gun manufacturer and you're selling what Bernie Sanders thinks are too many guns in a particular area, then maybe you've got some liability issues here.
[03:39:16.911 --> 03:39:19.711]  Because there shouldn't be that many guns going to that area.
[03:39:19.711 --> 03:39:24.173]  Who is he to decide how many guns people in a given area should be buying?
[03:39:25.077 --> 03:39:26.578]  Absolute nonsense.
[03:39:26.578 --> 03:39:30.500]  And of course what he does is he comes out in support of an assault weapon ban.
[03:39:30.500 --> 03:39:36.244]  You know, that imaginary chimera, the assault weapon, that favorite thing of the left.
[03:39:36.244 --> 03:39:38.486]  They don't even know what an assault weapon is.
[03:39:38.486 --> 03:39:41.107]  An assault weapon is a gun that they're scared of.
[03:39:41.107 --> 03:39:41.487]  And you know what?
[03:39:41.487 --> 03:39:43.589]  They're scared of every single gun.
[03:39:43.589 --> 03:39:45.590]  They don't have a definition of an assault weapon.
[03:39:45.590 --> 03:39:49.873]  If they want to talk about it being a military-style weapon, well you know, that is expressly
[03:39:50.613 --> 03:39:53.295]  Uh, permitted, uh, not permitted.
[03:39:53.295 --> 03:39:55.015]  We don't get permission from the Constitution.
[03:39:55.015 --> 03:39:59.998]  It is expressly guaranteed that we have a right as a militia to own military weapons.
[03:39:59.998 --> 03:40:01.219]  That's what the militia was about.
[03:40:01.219 --> 03:40:08.422]  It was really for the militia to protect our country from foreign invaders, from domestic governments that overstepped themselves.
[03:40:08.422 --> 03:40:10.984]  That was to be our line of protection, not to have a standing army.
[03:40:11.829 --> 03:40:17.112]  I'd have a standing army of police or military in our country, but that's what we have now.
[03:40:17.112 --> 03:40:18.492]  Now what are some of the other candidates going to do?
[03:40:18.492 --> 03:40:20.313]  Well, they say they're going to play it safe.
[03:40:20.313 --> 03:40:27.837]  Anderson Cooper's not going to really try to mix it up with these guys, but I think that Webb and O'Malley realize that they have to mix it up.
[03:40:28.217 --> 03:40:29.878]  This is a quote from Webb.
[03:40:29.878 --> 03:40:32.900]  He says, Eisenhower didn't yap about D-Day in advance.
[03:40:32.900 --> 03:40:35.282]  And of course, Webb won a Navy cross.
[03:40:35.282 --> 03:40:36.963]  He won two Purple Hearts in Vietnam.
[03:40:36.963 --> 03:40:41.365]  He was head of the Defense Department for Reagan, I believe was his official title.
[03:40:41.365 --> 03:40:42.706]  Oh, he was Secretary of the Navy.
[03:40:42.706 --> 03:40:43.787]  Sorry, not the Defense Department.
[03:40:43.787 --> 03:40:46.749]  He was Secretary of the Navy under President Reagan.
[03:40:46.749 --> 03:40:50.911]  Then he ran as a Democrat and won a Senate from Virginia.
[03:40:51.892 --> 03:40:53.054]  So now he's back.
[03:40:53.054 --> 03:40:57.459]  Now, Chafee, they say, believes in ending drone strikes.
[03:40:57.459 --> 03:40:58.440]  Good.
[03:40:58.440 --> 03:41:01.864]  He entertains the idea of rapprochement with the Islamic State.
[03:41:01.864 --> 03:41:03.085]  Really?
[03:41:03.085 --> 03:41:06.149]  We already equip and train ISIS.
[03:41:06.149 --> 03:41:08.772]  What else can we do to make our relationships better with them?
[03:41:09.332 --> 03:41:13.875]  But he does say that Snowden did the right thing and he should come back to the United States.
[03:41:13.875 --> 03:41:15.537]  So we'll see what happens with this.
[03:41:15.537 --> 03:41:16.257]  It could be interesting.
[03:41:16.257 --> 03:41:18.679]  There might be some interesting things about foreign policy.
[03:41:18.679 --> 03:41:22.461]  Webb thinks that the United States has to focus its energies on Asia.
[03:41:22.461 --> 03:41:25.884]  He wrote an article in the day after September 11, 2001.
[03:41:25.884 --> 03:41:29.146]  In all caps he said, DO NOT OCCUPY TERRITORY.
[03:41:29.146 --> 03:41:30.988]  Yeah, well that's true.
[03:41:30.988 --> 03:41:33.850]  That was a big mistake for us to start occupying territory.
[03:41:33.850 --> 03:41:35.131]  It's also a big mistake for us to
[03:41:35.951 --> 03:41:41.577]  Follow the lies of the Bush administration and attack a country that didn't have anything to do with it, even by their own admission.
[03:41:41.577 --> 03:41:45.701]  Maybe what we should do is not only do not occupy, but do not invade.
[03:41:45.701 --> 03:41:53.870]  Maybe that would be something that we... You know, I think I remember something about avoiding foreign entanglements from our original founders.
[03:41:53.870 --> 03:41:58.315]  On the Republican side, we've got Marco Rubio winning the very first primary.
[03:41:59.329 --> 03:42:00.229]  Did you know that?
[03:42:00.229 --> 03:42:03.470]  Looks like he's a shoo-in to win the first primary.
[03:42:03.470 --> 03:42:04.611]  What primary would that be?
[03:42:04.611 --> 03:42:06.491]  Not Iowa, not New Hampshire.
[03:42:06.491 --> 03:42:08.832]  No, it's the Sheldon primary.
[03:42:08.832 --> 03:42:10.192]  Sheldon Adelson.
[03:42:10.192 --> 03:42:14.474]  You know, the guy that tried to rig the Nevada caucus four years ago?
[03:42:15.154 --> 03:42:18.196]  Remember he had a caucus that was for Jews only?
[03:42:18.196 --> 03:42:20.057]  Remember that?
[03:42:20.057 --> 03:42:23.500]  To try to edge out Ron Paul?
[03:42:23.500 --> 03:42:24.720]  Well, he's got a lot of money.
[03:42:24.720 --> 03:42:27.222]  As a matter of fact, he's got a lot more money than Donald Trump does.
[03:42:27.222 --> 03:42:33.146]  He's got a fortune that they estimate at being about $26 billion, and he throws that around in politics.
[03:42:33.146 --> 03:42:37.829]  He throws that around to get senators who will support his ban on online gaming.
[03:42:37.829 --> 03:42:44.934]  But his primary thing that he's concerned about is he wants somebody that is going to give unconditional support to Israel.
[03:42:45.674 --> 03:42:47.795]  And Rubio is his man.
[03:42:47.795 --> 03:43:00.438]  Gingrich was the one who had the for sale sign around his neck last time for Sheldon Adelson and he got I think over 10 million dollars from Sheldon Adelson and now everybody is saying that Marco Rubio looks like he's going to win the Adelson primary.
[03:43:00.438 --> 03:43:06.160]  You know we had a lot of candidates who made that trip to kiss the ring of Sheldon Adelson.
[03:43:07.336 --> 03:43:08.157]  Not too long ago.
[03:43:08.157 --> 03:43:12.999]  I think about the only two that I can remember not being there were Rand Paul and Donald Trump.
[03:43:12.999 --> 03:43:18.062]  The rest of them pretty much sucking up to him for whatever scraps they could get thrown to them.
[03:43:18.062 --> 03:43:24.266]  Of course, there's also another article today about Ben Carson just becoming a Republican less than a year ago.
[03:43:25.146 --> 03:43:26.466]  Isn't that interesting?
[03:43:26.466 --> 03:43:35.749]  I think it's interesting that not only did he not become a Republican until then, but when he registered to vote in Maryland, he didn't really participate too much.
[03:43:35.749 --> 03:43:37.550]  He really wasn't very politically active.
[03:43:37.550 --> 03:43:39.931]  He registered to vote in 2001.
[03:43:39.931 --> 03:43:43.512]  He voted in the general elections of 2004, 6, 8, 10, and 12, but never in any primaries.
[03:43:47.862 --> 03:43:55.584]  And I think that kind of explains why he really is kind of clueless when it comes to the Constitution and individual liberty.
[03:43:55.584 --> 03:43:59.946]  This is a guy who supports violating your informed consent.
[03:43:59.946 --> 03:44:04.827]  He supported in the past the same types of stuff that we just heard from Bernie Sanders.
[03:44:04.827 --> 03:44:11.950]  Hey, if you got a gun, and you can have a gun if you live in the country, but you know, if you're in the city, maybe people in the city shouldn't have guns.
[03:44:11.950 --> 03:44:12.870]  Absolutely clueless.
[03:44:13.690 --> 03:44:19.112]  Would he be the kind of brain surgeon you would want if he had never read a book on anatomy?
[03:44:19.112 --> 03:44:20.913]  Well, he's not the kind of president I want.
[03:44:20.913 --> 03:44:29.097]  No matter how good a man he is, no matter how honest he is, he doesn't seem to be interested in understanding the fundamental principles that created this country.
[03:44:29.873 --> 03:44:35.760]  I talked about this a little bit last night on the nightly news, the back and forth about Columbus Day, the controversy.
[03:44:35.760 --> 03:44:45.031]  We've had nine cities, most of them recent, saying that they're not going to celebrate Columbus Day, they're going to celebrate a Indigenous People's Day or something like that.
[03:44:45.865 --> 03:44:49.769]  And we played some comments from Russell Means, who I respect a great deal.
[03:44:49.769 --> 03:44:52.793]  Russell Means is very angry about Columbus' history.
[03:44:52.793 --> 03:44:55.236]  But you know, there were bad things that Columbus did.
[03:44:55.236 --> 03:44:57.999]  There were bad things that happened with the Native Americans here.
[03:44:57.999 --> 03:45:00.582]  They also had slavery and genocide and war.
[03:45:00.582 --> 03:45:03.826]  That's not just something that was done by Europeans.
[03:45:05.131 --> 03:45:14.779]  Where we need to come together is we need to look at our shared understanding of individual liberty, what was enshrined in our Constitution.
[03:45:14.779 --> 03:45:20.644]  And we need candidates who have a history of that, who have an experience of that, who have passion for that.
[03:45:21.701 --> 03:45:28.968]  We don't need people who are absolutely disinterested in that, who simply want to put themselves up as president for whatever reason.
[03:45:28.968 --> 03:45:36.274]  And when we go back and we look at the party platform of the small independent, and that's the other thing too, he sought out a very small third party
[03:45:38.716 --> 03:45:40.477]  It was, let's see, what was the name of this?
[03:45:40.477 --> 03:45:43.179]  It was the Independence Party of Florida.
[03:45:43.179 --> 03:45:45.721]  I looked through their platform and their plank.
[03:45:45.721 --> 03:45:47.502]  Very, very sketchy.
[03:45:47.502 --> 03:45:48.043]  Liberty?
[03:45:48.043 --> 03:45:52.366]  Nah, they don't talk about that except, you know, life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
[03:45:52.366 --> 03:45:54.407]  But other than that, they don't talk about liberty or freedom.
[03:45:54.407 --> 03:45:56.328]  They talk about rights in a couple of places.
[03:45:56.328 --> 03:46:05.795]  They do get some things right in terms of fiscal responsibility, having recall of elected officials, restrict taxing authority to only elected boards, and that sort of thing.
[03:46:06.295 --> 03:46:10.259]  A really kind of strange ad hoc collection of issues here.
[03:46:10.259 --> 03:46:13.282]  They do put out the fact they think that health care should be a right.
[03:46:13.282 --> 03:46:16.625]  I'm sorry, but that's rights in my opinion.
[03:46:16.625 --> 03:46:20.248]  Let's understand this, because Barack Obama understood this when he ran.
[03:46:20.248 --> 03:46:24.752]  He made a distinction between negative rights and positive rights.
[03:46:25.714 --> 03:46:31.241]  Now he said, and he was right, Barack Obama said, the Constitution talked about negative rights.
[03:46:31.241 --> 03:46:36.367]  It says, you're going to have rights that are guaranteed that the government can't take these things away from you.
[03:46:36.367 --> 03:46:37.308]  They can't infringe on them.
[03:46:37.308 --> 03:46:41.153]  You know, like Obama's trying to take our Second Amendment rights and other freedoms.
[03:46:42.134 --> 03:46:44.235]  He said, that was what the founders set up.
[03:46:44.235 --> 03:46:46.475]  And he said, I don't agree with that.
[03:46:46.475 --> 03:46:48.016]  He said that before we elected him president.
[03:46:48.016 --> 03:46:49.416]  Nobody paid any attention much.
[03:46:49.416 --> 03:46:50.976]  He said, I don't agree with that.
[03:46:50.976 --> 03:46:52.317]  I think rights should be positive.
[03:46:52.317 --> 03:47:00.059]  You know, you have a right to food, you have a right to this, you have a right to health care, which means that you've got to hold a gun to somebody else's head to provide that for you.
[03:47:00.059 --> 03:47:03.000]  See, that's a socialist right, okay?
[03:47:03.000 --> 03:47:05.280]  We're talking about libertarian rights.
[03:47:05.280 --> 03:47:07.101]  The right to be left alone.
[03:47:07.941 --> 03:47:10.282]  That's the right that's worth fighting for.
[03:47:10.282 --> 03:47:11.823]  That's what we need to have.
[03:47:11.823 --> 03:47:17.567]  But when you start talking about your entitlement programs as being rights, now you've gone off the rails.
[03:47:17.567 --> 03:47:19.127]  That's not what this country is about.
[03:47:19.127 --> 03:47:21.629]  That's not going to work, especially with open borders.
[03:47:21.629 --> 03:47:22.549]  They know that.
[03:47:22.549 --> 03:47:27.012]  That's why they're opening the borders, because they want to take everything down.
[03:47:27.012 --> 03:47:31.655]  Now, I also want to talk about the other race that's out here, and that's the race for House.
[03:47:32.532 --> 03:47:40.122]  Speaker, we had Boehner step down and then when it looked like, when his candidate stepped down, he said, alright, we're not going to have the election.
[03:47:40.122 --> 03:47:44.949]  Let's talk a little bit about a couple of the guys that would have been on that ballot for election.
[03:47:44.949 --> 03:47:46.891]  Let's talk about Daniel Webster.
[03:47:47.717 --> 03:48:02.387]  I put up a, I talked about this last week, and we put up a video called The Devil and Daniel Webster, because that's essentially the choice that we've got right now, is we've got some devils that are being put out there by John Boehner, and we've got Daniel Webster.
[03:48:02.387 --> 03:48:11.294]  And it's interesting, because you may not agree with Daniel Webster on every one of the issues, but I think one of the things that he has right, and he served as Speaker of the House in Florida,
[03:48:12.154 --> 03:48:19.306]  And as articles from NPR and National Review point out, he essentially flattened the hierarchy.
[03:48:19.306 --> 03:48:20.668]  That's what he's campaigning on.
[03:48:20.668 --> 03:48:23.913]  He's saying, I'm not going to dictate things like John Boehner.
[03:48:23.913 --> 03:48:26.097]  That would be a huge start to do that.
[03:48:26.800 --> 03:48:43.205]  To actually let the representatives that we've elected do some things, rather than having a, do what they were elected for, follow some of the issues that they were elected for, rather than throwing them out of committees and making them completely powerless if they don't do exactly as you dictate.
[03:48:43.205 --> 03:48:50.627]  That's been the leadership style of John Boehner, and we can still see that leadership style in the way he's handling the election to replace him.
[03:48:51.167 --> 03:48:55.910]  Shutting it down arbitrarily and saying we're not going to have an election until I get a candidate that I want.
[03:48:55.910 --> 03:49:00.253]  So we had Daniel Webster who had been a Speaker of the House in Florida.
[03:49:00.253 --> 03:49:04.175]  He said he wanted to flatten the pyramid of power.
[03:49:04.175 --> 03:49:09.038]  Also they say in National Review that he has a surprisingly diverse appeal as Speaker.
[03:49:09.739 --> 03:49:11.922]  Uh, they say he's a legend in Florida politics.
[03:49:11.922 --> 03:49:17.850]  They say for a good solid 10 plus years, Daniel Webster was Florida politics, not just Republican, but both.
[03:49:17.850 --> 03:49:21.074]  And if he didn't sign off on something, it didn't happen.
[03:49:21.074 --> 03:49:22.656]  Maybe we could get something
[03:49:23.806 --> 03:49:35.129]  Maybe we could get our representatives to actually do some of the things we've elected them to do if we got rid of this globalist leadership that is exactly the same as the Democrats.
[03:49:35.129 --> 03:49:41.350]  As I pointed out before, one of the reasons to watch tonight is because the Democrats are going to be honest about their agenda.
[03:49:41.350 --> 03:49:45.111]  Their globalist, multinational, corporatist agenda, for the most part.
[03:49:45.111 --> 03:49:46.151]  They'll lie about some of it.
[03:49:46.151 --> 03:49:49.992]  They'll say they're not for the Trans-Pacific Partnership, when in reality they will support that.
[03:49:51.172 --> 03:50:01.318]  We need to understand where they're pushing for government because we know that unless we change the leadership in the House and the Senate from McConnell and Boehner, we are going to get exactly the same thing.
[03:50:02.034 --> 03:50:11.136]  Now, one of the other guys who was running was Jason Chaffetz, and there's been a controversy with him, just like there was with Kevin McCarthy, the guy who stepped down, the guy who is currently number two.
[03:50:11.136 --> 03:50:24.219]  Remember, Kevin McCarthy went on the Sean Hannity Show and said that he bragged about the fact that Hillary Clinton's poll numbers plummeted after the Benghazi investigation, implying that that was the purpose of the Benghazi investigation.
[03:50:24.799 --> 03:50:28.160]  And quite frankly, I think that was the purpose of the leadership.
[03:50:28.160 --> 03:50:30.161]  Simply to score cheap political points.
[03:50:30.161 --> 03:50:32.361]  I don't think they wanted to put anybody in jail.
[03:50:32.361 --> 03:50:33.762]  I don't think they wanted to change anything.
[03:50:33.762 --> 03:50:35.322]  That's been the case over and over again.
[03:50:35.322 --> 03:50:38.543]  With Obama, with Clinton, with Eric Holder.
[03:50:38.543 --> 03:50:45.885]  Now we have Jason Chaffetz in a controversy saying that he investigated Planned Parenthood and he didn't find anything wrong.
[03:50:46.525 --> 03:50:52.067]  And he's had to walk those comments back, saying, no, I wasn't talking about the baby parts stuff, we haven't investigated that.
[03:50:52.067 --> 03:50:54.648]  Still, is that the kind of guy you want running?
[03:50:54.648 --> 03:51:00.830]  That's a guy who, his entire family were insiders in the Democrat Party, he reinvented himself as a Tea Party candidate.
[03:51:00.830 --> 03:51:01.790]  Stay with us, we'll be right back.
[03:51:05.546 --> 03:51:07.609]  Hey neighbor, what are you doing digging?
[03:51:07.609 --> 03:51:09.332]  You had a heart attack last year.
[03:51:09.332 --> 03:51:10.795]  Oh, I know.
[03:51:10.795 --> 03:51:12.718]  I was told no more hard labor.
[03:51:12.718 --> 03:51:14.300]  Then why are you digging?
[03:51:14.300 --> 03:51:16.143]  Well, I've been taking extendovite.
[03:51:16.143 --> 03:51:17.906]  It's been approved to help my heart.
[03:51:17.906 --> 03:51:18.968]  Extendovite?
[03:51:18.968 --> 03:51:19.849]  Is that a new drug?
[03:51:20.683 --> 03:51:22.044]  No, not a drug.
[03:51:22.044 --> 03:51:25.865]  It's more like an herbal combination made from garlic and cayenne.
[03:51:25.865 --> 03:51:26.506]  Herbal?
[03:51:26.506 --> 03:51:28.006]  How can that help?
[03:51:28.006 --> 03:51:32.588]  Well, actually, we've taken herbs for thousands of years, and Xtendivite is doing the job for me.
[03:51:32.588 --> 03:51:35.189]  Does your doctor know about Xtendivite?
[03:51:35.189 --> 03:51:38.791]  Yeah, my doctor knows, and he said it seems to be working for you, so don't stop taking it.
[03:51:39.071 --> 03:51:40.833]  I feel great taking Xtendivite.
[03:51:40.833 --> 03:51:41.994]  I don't want to stop.
[03:51:41.994 --> 03:51:43.236]  To order, call 1-877-928-8822.
[03:51:43.236 --> 03:51:43.997]  That's 1-877-928-8822.
[03:51:43.997 --> 03:51:46.219]  Or visit our website at heartdrop.com.
[03:51:59.420 --> 03:52:05.124]  Your liver can be full of fatty deposits, built-up toxins, and even dangerous objects known as liver stones.
[03:52:05.124 --> 03:52:19.573]  We worked with the top developers in the field of detox to take tried and true herbs and other compounds known to safely cleanse the liver and fuse it with the latest research and technological development on concentrating these ingredients to give you the maximum effect.
[03:52:19.773 --> 03:52:27.556]  Liver Shield is the only liver support product on the market that uses a patented Spigerex blend of powerful organic herbs that support detoxification.
[03:52:27.556 --> 03:52:33.038]  And when you visit InfoWarsLife.com, see the instructional video on how to do a six-day liver detox.

[03:53:08.381 --> 03:53:13.863]  They've got hordes of salesmen out there trying to scare you into signing one of their long-term contracts.

[03:54:11.400 --> 03:54:14.522]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:54:14.522 --> 03:54:19.706]  I'm David Knight, your host, and this is our last segment of the fourth hour of the news wrap-up.
[03:54:19.706 --> 03:54:21.927]  Joining us in this segment is Leanne McAdoo.
[03:54:21.927 --> 03:54:25.450]  We're going to talk about what's coming up tonight on the nightly news.
[03:54:25.450 --> 03:54:37.278]  It's interesting, Leanne, that there were literally hundreds of thousands of people protesting these secret multinational trade agreements in Europe, and yet in America there's very little talk about it.
[03:54:37.278 --> 03:54:40.180]  I think this may come up tonight when we cover the debate
[03:54:40.780 --> 03:54:55.298]  That may come up tangentially in the sense that Hillary Clinton has flip-flopped on this, but what we see over and over again is that the Democrats, of course, will avoid talking about the central issue, which is one of sovereignty, about trying to end sovereignty.
[03:54:56.181 --> 03:55:00.344]  They will focus instead on a unions versus corporations aspect.
[03:55:00.344 --> 03:55:05.147]  They will portray Hillary Clinton, and rightfully so, as a puppet of multinational corporations.
[03:55:05.147 --> 03:55:09.690]  I guess maybe, you know, one of the songs that she could use in her playlist would be the one from Pinocchio.
[03:55:09.690 --> 03:55:12.011]  I had strings, but there's no strings on me now.
[03:55:13.432 --> 03:55:14.792]  Now I'm free.
[03:55:14.792 --> 03:55:19.213]  Maybe that's what she's going to try to sell people, but it'll be interesting to see what happens tonight.
[03:55:19.213 --> 03:55:20.294]  And we're going to be covering this.
[03:55:20.294 --> 03:55:25.215]  The hashtag is hashtag DemDebate if you want to join us, if you want to ask questions.
[03:55:25.215 --> 03:55:28.375]  We're going to be commenting on it, kind of like the Mystery Science 3000 debate.
[03:55:28.375 --> 03:55:31.456]  Yeah, it's always a fun time when we cover the debates.
[03:55:31.456 --> 03:55:38.417]  It'll definitely be interesting to see if they even address her flip-flopping on the TPP and other issues as well.
[03:55:38.417 --> 03:55:40.978]  I think they're going to steer clear of
[03:55:42.102 --> 03:55:47.328]  Whereas in the last debate they openly admitted that they were going to try and get them fighting amongst each other.
[03:55:47.328 --> 03:55:50.412]  Here they're coming out trying to play the moral high ground.
[03:55:50.412 --> 03:55:53.355]  We're not going to do that because we're not going to ask any hard questions.
[03:55:53.355 --> 03:55:58.701]  Well, Anderson Cooper said these are serious candidates and they have serious issues.
[03:55:58.701 --> 03:56:00.343]  They're not like Republicans, you know.
[03:56:00.343 --> 03:56:00.544]  Right.
[03:56:01.394 --> 03:56:06.076]  Yeah, and they're turning this, they're really selling this as this is going to be the greatest show on earth.
[03:56:06.076 --> 03:56:07.597]  You know, they set the podium up.
[03:56:07.597 --> 03:56:08.257]  Will he come?
[03:56:08.257 --> 03:56:08.998]  Won't he come?
[03:56:08.998 --> 03:56:10.558]  Will Biden be there?
[03:56:10.558 --> 03:56:17.401]  And they have it where you can actually, if you own one of these virtual reality headsets, you can watch the debate in 3D.
[03:56:17.401 --> 03:56:21.443]  So they say you can see what the candidates are doing when the camera is not on them.
[03:56:21.443 --> 03:56:26.966]  Of course, I'm sure they're not going to be able to go behind the candidates and see the strings that are pulling them and moving their mouths.
[03:56:27.606 --> 03:56:28.127]  Oh, exactly.
[03:56:28.127 --> 03:56:29.688]  Yeah, well that's what we're going to be looking at.
[03:56:29.688 --> 03:56:31.911]  And you know, this is going to be interesting.
[03:56:31.911 --> 03:56:36.635]  What you don't hear, the questions that you don't hear asked at these debates are what's really said.
[03:56:36.635 --> 03:56:38.717]  Nobody ever questions the surveillance state.
[03:56:38.717 --> 03:56:42.381]  Nobody ever questions CISPA, or now CISA that they're coming after.
[03:56:42.381 --> 03:56:44.223]  Or the military industrial complex.
[03:56:44.223 --> 03:56:45.164]  That's right, that's right.
[03:56:45.164 --> 03:56:47.126]  You don't get that kind of question asked.
[03:56:47.126 --> 03:56:48.047]  And you know, there's an article
[03:56:48.627 --> 03:56:49.889]  That just came out today.
[03:56:49.889 --> 03:56:58.202]  Google Street View cars are now going to map the San Francisco Bay Area with pollution levels and they're going to go down, Leanne, even to the cigarette smoke level.
[03:56:58.202 --> 03:56:59.624]  And this is what we've been saying all along.
[03:57:00.612 --> 03:57:07.237]  Not only are they going to be using these robot cars from Google, self-driving cars they like to call them, they're robot cars from Google, from Uber.
[03:57:07.237 --> 03:57:13.962]  Not only are they going to use that to control our transportation, but they're going to use it to have complete total surveillance.
[03:57:13.962 --> 03:57:22.388]  Total control of transportation, total surveillance of us so they can spy on us, so they can tax us, and this is just one more example of how this is going to be used.
[03:57:22.388 --> 03:57:29.654]  And they do this, like the story we had about a year ago, a week ago rather, private database lets the police skirt license plate data limits.
[03:57:30.074 --> 03:57:33.996]  They always do this, like with CISPA, saying they're going to share information.
[03:57:33.996 --> 03:57:37.377]  You turn this information over to these companies so it's their information about you.
[03:57:37.377 --> 03:57:43.660]  So the companies can spy on you and not violate your Fourth Amendment, they say, and then they can turn that information over to the government.
[03:57:43.660 --> 03:57:45.161]  That's the fiction that they use.
[03:57:45.161 --> 03:57:47.082]  That's what's so concerning about this.
[03:57:47.082 --> 03:57:57.507]  And everyone scoffed when we pointed out how the Green Police commercial was really prepping you for this future Green Police, and lo and behold, it really is unfolding this way.
[03:57:57.947 --> 03:57:59.368]  That's precisely what they're going to do.
[03:57:59.368 --> 03:58:01.109]  So there's going to be any talk about that.
[03:58:01.109 --> 03:58:03.031]  They're not going to talk about when they talk about the economy.
[03:58:03.031 --> 03:58:05.852]  They're not going to talk about the Federal Reserve manipulating people.
[03:58:05.852 --> 03:58:09.155]  I mean, we wouldn't want to go into that.
[03:58:09.155 --> 03:58:10.936]  But we're going to go into that tonight.
[03:58:10.936 --> 03:58:12.937]  We're going to talk about that even if they want.
[03:58:12.937 --> 03:58:13.858]  So join us tonight.
[03:58:14.538 --> 03:58:17.580]  We're going to be covering the news will start at 7 central 8 p.m.
[03:58:17.580 --> 03:58:32.687]  Eastern the debate will start a half hour later 730 central 830 Eastern we will cover it for the entire two hours Leanne McAdoo will be there with me and Joe Biggs I believe is also going to be there so we're going to be commenting on the Democrat debate as it happens you can join us on Twitter hashtag dim debate
