[00:00.000 --> 00:13.000]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he

[00:35.960 --> 00:41.800]  for Alex Jones today huge show lined up we've got Anthony Gucciotti at the bottom of the hour
[00:41.800 --> 00:46.120]  talking about self-empowerment and a raft of other issues we're also going to take your calls
[00:46.120 --> 00:53.640]  at the beginning of the second hour at 1-800-259-9231 bottom of the second hour this is going to be a
[00:53.640 --> 00:59.800]  really interesting interview for me we've got behavioral scientist Gad Sad on to talk about
[00:59.800 --> 01:05.400]  political correctness he's recently become intertwined with this fight with social justice
[01:05.400 --> 01:11.640]  warriors feminist control freaks so we're going to get his take from a psychological view on why
[01:11.640 --> 01:16.840]  these people push these narratives why they're so obsessed with censorship that's going to be a key
[01:16.840 --> 01:23.480]  interview we may take your calls after that as well Alex Jones has filed a special report on ISIS
[01:23.480 --> 01:30.200]  obtaining these brand new toyotas in the Middle East it's apparently according to the media a huge
[01:30.200 --> 01:35.480]  mystery as to why they obtained these vehicles as it was you know the huge weapons drops that
[01:35.480 --> 01:40.680]  routinely accidentally fall into the hands of ISIS jihadists so we're going to go to that special
[01:40.680 --> 01:47.960]  report in the second segment but first this this is top story on drugereport.com right now and info
[01:47.960 --> 01:56.920]  was busted CNN users Jeb Bush staffer planted in audience to frame Donald Trump let's go to that clip
[01:56.920 --> 02:06.280]  Donald Trump is always using the c-word about women I cherish women I cherish women I cherish
[02:06.280 --> 02:15.000]  women but it wasn't the word a woman used to question Trump so maybe I'm wrong maybe you
[02:15.000 --> 02:19.080]  can prove me wrong but I don't think that you're a friend to woman how what it
[02:19.080 --> 02:30.600]  I knew I shouldn't have picked her but the Donald plunged on I respect women incredibly I have given
[02:30.600 --> 02:37.080]  women more opportunity than I would say virtually anybody in the construction industry Trump invoked
[02:37.080 --> 02:43.400]  his wife he invoked his daughter he invoked his mother my mother was one of the great people of
[02:43.400 --> 02:50.440]  the world maybe the greatest ever did mom ever stare at you like this Donald I respect women I
[02:50.440 --> 02:55.800]  love women I cherish women you know Hilary Clinton said he shouldn't cherish well if it's all the
[02:55.800 --> 03:03.320]  same to you mr. Trump I'd rather you stop cherishing women and start respecting women I do cherish I
[03:03.320 --> 03:08.680]  cherish women and just when Trump thought it was safe to go on to the next question if you become
[03:08.680 --> 03:13.800]  president will a woman make the same as a man and do I get to choose what I do with my body
[03:16.120 --> 03:19.880]  you're gonna make the same if you do as good a job and I happen to be pro-life
[03:19.880 --> 03:25.640]  as for what his questioner did with her body hands-on hips eyebrow cocked
[03:25.640 --> 03:39.960]  jenny moe cnn cherishes the world new york now of course what cnn didn't tell you about that
[03:39.960 --> 03:45.560]  clip about that interruption about that provocateur during a donald trump event was that this
[03:45.560 --> 03:52.280]  individual lauren batch elder who played basically the role of a stooge feminist i mean she exhibited
[03:52.280 --> 03:58.440]  all the classical mannerisms of an obnoxious whining feminist she's not an independent
[03:58.440 --> 04:04.920]  individual you can see here conservative treehouse has the article she's a jeb bush staffer okay you
[04:04.920 --> 04:09.960]  may be forgiven for thinking that you know Hilary Clinton placed her in that crowd she's actually
[04:09.960 --> 04:17.320]  working for jeb bush she's a plant she's a stooge to play the role of an angry feminist again to
[04:17.320 --> 04:24.200]  try and tear down donald trump on this war on women issue and of course behind the scenes there's a
[04:24.200 --> 04:29.720]  huge move at the moment amongst the establishment gop republican candidates this has come out of
[04:29.720 --> 04:35.400]  washington whispers and other sources that they're involved in a coordinated effort to bring down
[04:35.400 --> 04:41.800]  donald trump and that move is intensifying right now this is a part of it we're gonna get more into
[04:41.800 --> 04:47.560]  this after the break alex jones special report on isis obtaining toyota trucked right after the
[04:47.560 --> 04:57.720]  break ton of news coming up stay tuned this is the alex joneshowlifeinfo wars dot com
[04:59.640 --> 05:03.880]  just when you thought you've heard it all parents are pulling their children out of a bay area grade
[05:03.880 --> 05:08.200]  school because of a third grader that has been terrorizing fellow students that's right the
[05:08.200 --> 05:13.240]  unnamed boy who attends mount diablo elementary school has become so violent and out of control
[05:13.240 --> 05:17.960]  the principal there has had to place the school on lockdown several times the third grader in
[05:17.960 --> 05:21.880]  question has thrown rocks at teachers other students knocked over garbage cans punched
[05:21.880 --> 05:26.120]  others in the stomach and locked himself in bathrooms the albers have gotten so bad that
[05:26.120 --> 05:30.280]  about 30 parents have pulled their children out of the school so far the school board administration
[05:30.280 --> 05:34.280]  has done nothing to address the situation and parents were quoted as saying they want a healthy
[05:34.280 --> 05:39.240]  safe learning environment for everyone while i got news for you schools are gun free zones which
[05:39.240 --> 05:43.960]  makes them very unsafe back in my day behavior like this would have gotten you sent to the
[05:43.960 --> 05:48.680]  principal's office to receive three wax from a paddle but i'm sure you won't see that in california

[08:22.520 --> 08:35.400]  resistance it's alex jones alex jones here for info wars dot com to break down and reveal the
[08:35.400 --> 08:43.000]  mystery behind why isis has hundreds and hundreds and hundreds perhaps more than a thousand late
[08:43.000 --> 08:51.560]  model armored militarized toyota trucks mainly from the united states now we reported on this
[08:51.560 --> 08:57.800]  in 2014 i'm going to show you some of the articles the mystery is solved and it's been solved since
[08:57.800 --> 09:05.320]  the beginning but it's hiding in plain view and if folks can understand this simplistic report
[09:05.320 --> 09:12.200]  that's factually based you can understand everything the globalist hide everything in plain view
[09:12.200 --> 09:19.640]  like we're idiots al nazra for four plus years has been funded by nato the united states turkey
[09:19.640 --> 09:26.840]  and many others it is al qaeda in syria that's in roiders that's an associated press they admit
[09:26.840 --> 09:31.720]  that's who the russians are now targeting that is al qaeda isis is another wahhabi has
[09:31.720 --> 09:38.600]  spent off of that creating islamic state in an area between syria and iraq so that's a separate
[09:38.600 --> 09:44.680]  new part of the caliphate the takeover of syria and the area around demascus that's going to be left
[09:44.680 --> 09:53.320]  to syria is being done by al qaeda al nazra the us quote gives the armored vehicles the missiles
[09:53.320 --> 09:58.760]  the weapons the saudi arabia gives them and others give them to al nazra who are the good
[09:58.760 --> 10:05.480]  rebels al qaeda and then they give them to isis and that's even come out in congress but the
[10:05.480 --> 10:09.400]  mainstream media just keeps acting like this isn't a fact the head of defense intelligence
[10:09.400 --> 10:14.920]  went public a couple months ago we played the clip here um they've had the deputy head of
[10:14.920 --> 10:19.400]  the ciago public because they're all covering their butts they're either covering their butts or
[10:20.360 --> 10:24.520]  they're signaling to everyone the treason has been committed and something needs to be done
[10:24.520 --> 10:28.280]  our military remember three years ago said we're not going to be the air force for al qaeda
[10:28.280 --> 10:33.400]  in syria so they changed name to isis to confuse the public so last week the treasury department
[10:33.400 --> 10:39.720]  comes out and says we want to know where the trucks came from because they're involved in import
[10:39.720 --> 10:46.040]  export controls uh through the commerce department and so they say we want to know what the commerce
[10:46.040 --> 10:50.040]  department and the treasury where the toilets came from well we know a bunch of them came from
[10:50.040 --> 10:57.080]  texas i'm going to show you the articles it's been in mpr a year ago even mpr got it right it's
[10:57.080 --> 11:04.200]  been in the spectator uh it's been an info wars it's been known it's been known for a long long
[11:04.200 --> 11:09.720]  time just buried in the articles and then they say where did they get them are they covering
[11:09.720 --> 11:14.280]  their butts or are they trying to signal that the public should investigate this i think it's a
[11:14.280 --> 11:17.080]  little bit of both but here are some of the articles here's an article at washington's
[11:17.080 --> 11:24.840]  blog upon info wars dot com today that breaks it all down uh and has the uh link to the spectator
[11:24.840 --> 11:35.560]  and it also uh has uh the link uh to the public radio you can go to public radio
[11:35.560 --> 11:40.280]  pri international part of public radio and you can read the article right here uh this
[11:41.080 --> 11:44.840]  one Toyota pickup truck is at the top of the shopping list for the free Syrian army
[11:44.840 --> 11:52.200]  and the Taliban 2014 and then you go into the article it admits down here in the story that
[11:52.200 --> 11:57.640]  it's come from the united states given to al nazar and the state department that's Hillary
[11:57.640 --> 12:04.040]  clinton gave a non-lethal aid to the Syrian rebels al nazar okay boom now let's continue
[12:05.720 --> 12:13.880]  isis drives texas made Toyota trucks apparently modified for us special forces and then it gets
[12:13.880 --> 12:18.680]  in how these were made in texas and it links to all the admissions from the us army orders and
[12:18.680 --> 12:24.200]  it's total proof info wars dot com here's another one where did isis get all those toyotas this is
[12:24.200 --> 12:30.760]  last week seven days ago october 7th christian science monitor us official asked how isis got
[12:30.760 --> 12:37.960]  so many Toyota trucks a machine is seven days ago so there's that report uh then of course isis
[12:37.960 --> 12:44.440]  got a bunch of quote weapons from iraq accidentally that the u.s military left form they've got
[12:44.440 --> 12:50.760]  pre-crime systems watching our troops before they commit a crime with computers beyond 1984
[12:50.760 --> 12:55.560]  minority report but the people running the pentagon and running the white house are arming al-qaeda
[12:55.560 --> 12:59.960]  and that's okay and it's hidden in plain view where's the current crime monitoring on this
[13:00.920 --> 13:05.800]  let's continue here i mean i try to bring fruit into the country i'll get arrested we're out of
[13:05.800 --> 13:11.080]  the country but you can just give stinger missiles al-qaeda and trucks and nobody gets in trouble
[13:11.080 --> 13:15.960]  now here's another one four-wheel drives to isis what longbows were the english it
[13:16.520 --> 13:21.560]  you know they're big battle and then it goes on the welsh longbowman meanwhile there's the big
[13:21.560 --> 13:29.480]  speaker fight and it turns out that um obama is supporting of course paul ryan we do not need
[13:29.480 --> 13:37.160]  another neocon rhino uh controller in there and we've got jeb bush planting staffers in attendance
[13:37.160 --> 13:41.080]  to try to bring down trump and the reason i add these stories to the end of this whole thing about
[13:41.080 --> 13:45.160]  the mystery of the trucks that is no mystery is it just shows how rigged everything is in the
[13:45.160 --> 13:50.600]  establishment and if we wake up to the rigging of this and don't act like inept illiterate morons
[13:50.600 --> 13:56.760]  politically geopolitically it's over so there is no mystery to the toyotas there is no mystery
[13:56.760 --> 14:03.320]  about al-nazara there is no mystery about islamic state isis yissel they play on the public's
[14:03.320 --> 14:09.880]  ignorance to confuse people the u.s. military the cia defense intelligence the fbi everybody
[14:09.880 --> 14:13.720]  knows what's going on here and most people don't like it to the credit of the government
[14:14.280 --> 14:20.360]  and they're saying american people stand up do something we need you to speak out we need the
[14:20.360 --> 14:26.600]  press to speak out and talk about it but abc news everybody's like gee where the trucks come from
[14:26.600 --> 14:35.400]  we don't know we gave them to the nice rebels al-nazara and now they're in ices hands and clearly
[14:35.400 --> 14:38.920]  some of the trucks came from other places too that saudi arabia bought and gave them so they're
[14:38.920 --> 14:45.160]  confusing the public of saudi arabia bought a multi shiploads from japan so there's there's
[14:45.160 --> 14:49.560]  different groups but a bunch of them came from texas and we just gave you all the proof right
[14:49.560 --> 14:55.400]  there this is sensational and what's old news is new news we know this the general public doesn't
[14:55.400 --> 14:59.160]  know it so now someone in the pentagon someone in the treasury department they've all been saying
[14:59.160 --> 15:03.960]  this say look at where the trucks came from look at where the trucks came from we should look at
[15:03.960 --> 15:07.400]  where the trucks came from because we know where the trucks came from all right i'm going to throw
[15:07.400 --> 15:11.880]  this back over to paul joes of watson transmitting and broadcasting worldwide and i'll be back in
[15:11.880 --> 15:16.680]  the saddle lord willing tomorrow 11 a.m. central right here at the tip of the spear info wars

[15:34.360 --> 15:39.480]  special report on how isis are obtaining all these toyota trucks again the media is acting like
[15:39.480 --> 15:44.040]  they're completely ignorant as to where they're coming from we know that isis has been armed
[15:44.040 --> 15:49.560]  they've been given equipment by saudi arabia they've stolen it from iraqi military forces
[15:49.560 --> 15:55.160]  and in some cases they miraculously discover these u.s. weapons airdrops that they always
[15:55.160 --> 16:00.520]  seem to stumble across we've got more news coming on that later actually shifting back to our top
[16:00.520 --> 16:05.240]  story which alex uh mentioned there basically donald trump gave a speech last night he was
[16:05.240 --> 16:12.200]  interrupted by somebody posing as a radical feminist they had all the mannerisms and basically
[16:12.200 --> 16:20.120]  confronted him on the gender pay gap on the notion that he hates women turns out and cnn of course
[16:20.120 --> 16:25.800]  didn't report this in their entire report on this issue that happened last night this woman
[16:25.800 --> 16:30.760]  is a plan you can see here on the website conservative treehouse and you can click through
[16:30.760 --> 16:38.760]  to her linkedin profile she's a staffer for jeb bush but not only that she also works for senator
[16:38.760 --> 16:43.880]  iota who is pro-life and if you go back to that clip which we're going to play again in a second
[16:44.680 --> 16:50.120]  she says you know classical feminist talking point women's rights activist hillary clinton
[16:50.120 --> 16:54.920]  supporter i have the right to do with my own body what i want to do and yet she's working
[16:54.920 --> 17:01.240]  for somebody who is pro-life a republican senator she's working for jeb bush this is a staged
[17:01.240 --> 17:07.720]  provocation cnn has absolutely nothing to say about the fact that it is contrived let's go
[17:07.720 --> 17:13.880]  back to that clip let's play just a minute of that clip right now here's cnn donald trump is always
[17:13.880 --> 17:23.880]  using the c word about women i cherish women i cherish women i cherish women but it wasn't the
[17:23.880 --> 17:29.560]  word a woman used to question trump so maybe i'm wrong maybe you can prove me wrong but i don't
[17:29.560 --> 17:38.760]  think that you're a friend to women how what i knew i shouldn't have picked her but the donald
[17:38.760 --> 17:46.360]  plunged on i respect women incredibly i have given women more opportunity than i would say
[17:46.360 --> 17:52.760]  virtually anybody in the construction industry trump invoked his wife he invoked his daughter
[17:52.760 --> 17:58.920]  he invoked his mother my mother was one of the great people of the world maybe the greatest ever
[17:58.920 --> 18:05.400]  did mom ever stare at you like this donald i respect women i love women i cherish women you
[18:05.400 --> 18:10.840]  know hillary clinton said he shouldn't cherish well if it's all the same to you mr trump i'd
[18:10.840 --> 18:17.560]  rather you stop cherishing women and start respecting women i do cherish i cherish women
[18:17.560 --> 18:23.080]  and just when trump thought it was safe to go on to the next question if you become president
[18:23.080 --> 18:29.800]  will a woman make the same as a man and do i get to choose what i do with my body you're
[18:29.800 --> 18:34.360]  going to make the same if you do as good a job and i happen to be pro-life as for what his
[18:34.360 --> 18:43.320]  questioner did with her body hands on hips eyebrow cocked jenny moe cnn cherishes the
[18:44.040 --> 18:50.440]  the cnn lying once again not telling you the full story notice how they prevaricate over this

[24:30.920 --> 24:36.120]  but again you know whether you like donald trump or not and i made a video attacking him a couple
[24:36.120 --> 24:42.040]  of months ago on his flip-flopping he's a maverick he's unpredictable and if there's one thing that
[24:42.040 --> 24:47.880]  control freaks hate it's unpredictability which is now why behind the scenes does this move amongst
[24:47.880 --> 24:54.760]  these GOP establishment candidates to coordinate in a concerted effort to sink donald trump by
[24:54.760 --> 25:00.840]  these staged incidents which we saw last night with cnn carrying the water for this narrative again
[25:01.480 --> 25:07.640]  notice in the clip we played just before the break the narrative again did mom ever stare at you
[25:07.640 --> 25:14.120]  like this they act as if this is a real incident this woman is an actor she's a stooge so we have
[25:14.120 --> 25:20.600]  cnn amplifying this contrived twitter outrage culture which attempts to publicly shame people
[25:20.600 --> 25:27.080]  into apologizing it's a complete paper tiger it never works if you stand up to these authoritarians
[25:27.080 --> 25:30.920]  and basically say no i'm going to say what's on my mind i'm going to say what i think i'm not going
[25:30.920 --> 25:37.880]  to be intimidated by your propaganda and cnn is carrying that narrative without telling you it's
[25:37.880 --> 25:44.360]  very easy to go to her linkedin profile and see she's working for jeb bush she's also working for
[25:44.360 --> 25:51.720]  another republican senator who is pro-life while claiming that she's pro-abortion so from beginning
[25:51.720 --> 25:59.240]  to end a staged incident cnn carries the propaganda dutifully alex jones is on the line alex go ahead
[26:00.440 --> 26:05.720]  absolutely paul calling you via cell phone from the road taking care of key business uh do you
[26:05.720 --> 26:11.160]  read me clearly yeah you're coming through line and clear alex fantastic paul i'm not gonna be here
[26:11.160 --> 26:15.320]  long i'm gonna be filing more reports later in the broadcast today and of course back tomorrow but
[26:15.320 --> 26:23.400]  exactly it's this theme of absolutely everything being a staged as a three dollar bill and you
[26:23.400 --> 26:28.680]  have the public worldwide waking up to this that's why someone like donald trump is so popular
[26:28.680 --> 26:33.480]  is because if the establishment attacks someone well that everybody buys into them whether they're
[26:33.480 --> 26:40.920]  good or not it shows this system is a house of cards and is a total fraud but there's an article
[26:40.920 --> 26:44.840]  that you could cover today that i'm going to be covering tomorrow it's out of the
[26:44.840 --> 26:51.240]  atlantic monthly the most establishment democrat elitist publication they're probably is
[26:51.800 --> 26:59.480]  and the headline is the coddling of the american mind and it says the left is mentally ill and that
[26:59.480 --> 27:06.520]  the schools have been taken over by people removing word and that it's a cult of mentally ill people
[27:06.520 --> 27:15.880]  that have basically agoraphobia or or or a fear complex a panic attack by any information any
[27:15.880 --> 27:23.480]  words any language but what's incredible is this is the leftist social engineers telling older
[27:23.480 --> 27:29.960]  leftists that are upset and scared everything's okay it's just mental illness and they actually say
[27:29.960 --> 27:36.280]  most the young people are now mentally ill we need to screen the college students and list them
[27:36.280 --> 27:42.920]  all as mentally ill so they made their leftist children and young adults mentally ill gibbering
[27:42.920 --> 27:49.960]  moron and then they come in and report on how horrible it is and how they're going to teach them
[27:49.960 --> 27:56.920]  the proper political correctness the same thing obama did it a month ago at a college campus
[27:56.920 --> 28:03.800]  show show this use book needs to be incredible level of the control and the brainwashing
[28:03.800 --> 28:08.360]  and then obama is on info wars dot com in an interview he gave the new york newspaper
[28:08.360 --> 28:12.680]  steve watson your brother wrote a key story saying you've got to trust the government
[28:12.680 --> 28:18.280]  or things will collapse please trust us we want to take care of you government makes
[28:18.280 --> 28:24.360]  everything possible well good government can help a free market but no big government is
[28:24.360 --> 28:30.840]  deindustrializing the world under a 10 to 21 innovation and free market makes prosperity
[28:30.840 --> 28:36.280]  third world hell is created by big central government that he's pushing for but they
[28:36.280 --> 28:40.840]  have a nine percent approval rating they're begging us to buy back into their con game
[28:40.840 --> 28:45.320]  their confidence is totally collapsed with the public that's why they're crippling down
[28:45.320 --> 28:51.000]  saying please trust us and trying to intimidate us because we are unpredictable we're awake
[28:51.000 --> 28:56.440]  we're free we're dynamic and if we realize that this is the big battle they're pushing

[33:28.360 --> 33:36.040]  taking your calls in the second hour it's 1 800 259 92 31 now we've been discussing over the past
[33:36.040 --> 33:41.080]  few days and we've made some videos about this actually on facebook and youtube a couple of
[33:41.080 --> 33:48.920]  which are going to be uploaded over the next few days basically the culture the society has made
[33:48.920 --> 33:56.520]  being dumb trendy once again being intellectually sophisticated having conviction and being informed
[33:57.080 --> 34:02.920]  is being treated as some kind of social pariah issue where you're you know isolated from the
[34:02.920 --> 34:09.160]  from your peers because you're knowledgeable on certain issues that actually are of importance
[34:09.160 --> 34:13.880]  and that's something that we've covered on facebook on youtube so we're going to delve into that because
[34:13.880 --> 34:21.240]  we went to acl and sampled now just the general atmosphere of what resonates with young people
[34:21.240 --> 34:25.720]  obviously they're out there having fun they're not going to some kind of conference or meeting
[34:25.720 --> 34:30.600]  where they're going to discuss important issues but just hearing their conversations gives you a key
[34:30.600 --> 34:36.600]  insight into what motivates into what energizes and resonates with young people so we're going
[34:36.600 --> 34:41.400]  to discuss that we're going to take some of your calls cover some other issues anthony welcome to
[34:41.400 --> 34:46.760]  the show hey paul thanks for having me on so we made a couple of videos we went up to the mountain
[34:46.760 --> 34:52.440]  on saturday and we actually bumped into some you know quite energetic informed young people who were
[34:52.440 --> 34:57.720]  interested in what we were saying who weren't petrified of the fact that we could form actual
[34:57.720 --> 35:02.840]  sentences and that we weren't afraid of talking in public in front of other people you know which
[35:02.840 --> 35:08.520]  was positive because the previous night we went to acl and maybe we came away with a different
[35:08.520 --> 35:14.920]  impression so just get into what we saw at acl and how do we make you know being informed
[35:14.920 --> 35:19.880]  being knowledgeable having conviction how do we make that cool and trendy again how do we make
[35:19.880 --> 35:25.480]  that part of the zeitgeist where young people want to embrace that as something you know cool
[35:25.480 --> 35:29.160]  and trendy that they can share with their friends you know there are definitely smart people out
[35:29.160 --> 35:34.120]  there but i think what we're seeing unfortunately is the collapse of free thinking the collapse of
[35:34.120 --> 35:39.480]  society on a fundamental level where just being able to speak and having charisma and being able
[35:39.480 --> 35:44.840]  to communicate is looked at like you're some type of space alien and you're talking about acl music
[35:44.840 --> 35:52.840]  festival which we went to for like 20 minutes pretty much basically we went there and i get
[35:52.840 --> 35:56.840]  that people won't have fun that's totally fine we all do silly things to relax sometimes watch
[35:56.840 --> 36:02.120]  stupid television shows sometimes we all do it right no big deal but i mean the insanity of
[36:02.120 --> 36:07.080]  when we see hundreds of people walking the wrong way thinking they're going to the show but they're
[36:07.080 --> 36:11.480]  literally going the wrong way and i say hey do you guys know where you're going stop talking to me
[36:11.480 --> 36:16.280]  they look at me like i'm insane like how dare that person communicate with me another human
[36:16.280 --> 36:21.560]  being talking to a stranger oh my gosh like how could a human being speak to me right now
[36:21.560 --> 36:26.840]  or when we asked them you know we were filming a video in front of a bunch of people which all
[36:26.840 --> 36:31.080]  blows their mind how could they have the charisma to the video well because we're passionate we care
[36:31.080 --> 36:34.920]  about stuff we're filming a video and we actually asked them something well what do you think about
[36:34.920 --> 36:41.160]  this issue and they just like stared us like what like they have no they've never communicated before
[36:41.160 --> 36:46.360]  like that we we should have went up and been like hey you know when this you know this upcoming
[36:46.360 --> 36:51.960]  football game you know they just can't know some of these people unfortunately some people unfortunately
[36:51.960 --> 36:56.440]  just cannot grasp that level of communication and we're bad for even talking to them yeah we're
[36:56.440 --> 37:00.520]  bad for caring we're bad for having passion it's like idiocracy when they would make fun of people
[37:00.520 --> 37:07.000]  for using big words it's almost like basic levels of human compassion empathy basic levels of human
[37:07.000 --> 37:12.680]  intelligence are made fun of and if you exemplify them in any fashion like we did a live stream
[37:12.680 --> 37:16.600]  at this park and we were talking to some random people that actually got it they were really
[37:16.600 --> 37:21.000]  energizing like wow finding someone with passion that cares about people is really cool and they
[37:21.000 --> 37:25.400]  just watched us what we kind of did it but people walking by were just so freaked out that we're
[37:25.400 --> 37:31.400]  shooting videos in a public spot talking about important things that matter yeah I mean you
[37:31.400 --> 37:35.800]  did a you did a video on on Facebook with a perfect title that pretty much summarized all of it
[37:35.800 --> 37:41.480]  maybe not repeatable on air absolutely yeah I think there's a kind of fissure I mean I don't want
[37:41.480 --> 37:46.360]  to get too negative about it but basically it's it's splitting both ways where some people are
[37:46.360 --> 37:52.040]  becoming more dumb they're tuning out to a greater degree but some people are resonating more you
[37:52.040 --> 37:55.560]  know with a higher message I think that's what's going on and the people in the middle are just
[37:55.560 --> 38:01.160]  becoming irrelevant there's actually a study you talked about you know we walking out from ACL
[38:01.160 --> 38:06.200]  we were trying to find an Uber asking people you know what they were doing what they were looking
[38:06.200 --> 38:11.320]  for what direction they were going in and why one girl basically just said I don't know where I'm
[38:11.320 --> 38:16.440]  going she was literally following the herd so again she didn't even know what she was doing
[38:16.440 --> 38:21.080]  didn't even know didn't even have a clue at least she talked to us without being completely terrified
[38:21.080 --> 38:26.840]  I guess she got past that stage but there's this social conformity experiment which I'm going to
[38:26.840 --> 38:33.480]  talk about with my next guest and if you google Solomon ash conformity experiment Wikipedia
[38:33.480 --> 38:38.920]  it will come up and basically this ties into what we were saying because they had an experiment
[38:38.920 --> 38:42.840]  with eight participants there it is and if you scroll down there's an image on the right hand
[38:42.840 --> 38:48.520]  side with three lines there yeah right there so they got eight participants seven of them were
[38:48.520 --> 38:53.480]  stooge's right so there was only one real participant in the experiment all they had to do
[38:53.480 --> 39:00.360]  was say out loud which length the line on the left matched on the on the line on the right so you've
[39:00.360 --> 39:06.760]  got three vertical lines ABC if you just go back to that so it's obviously C right so they got seven
[39:06.760 --> 39:13.800]  participants in this experiment who are stooge's they all say an incorrect answer so they say that
[39:13.800 --> 39:20.520]  the line on the left is equivalent the same length as the line B for example which is obviously wrong
[39:20.520 --> 39:26.280]  but they're stooge's they're knowledgeable about the the agenda behind this experiment then the
[39:26.280 --> 39:33.160]  eighth participant who is completely independent doesn't know what's going on in 40% of the cases
[39:33.160 --> 39:38.840]  will mimic the answer of the previous seven participants in that experiment even though
[39:38.840 --> 39:45.560]  it's blatantly obvious that that is the incorrect answer simply because they want to conform to
[39:45.560 --> 39:53.000]  peer pressure 40% and if this if the stooge's said the right answer the margin of error was only 1%
[39:53.720 --> 40:00.120]  so again proving that they will follow the herd even if it's blatantly wrong even if they're saying
[40:00.120 --> 40:05.720]  something completely ridiculous they're more comfortable to follow the herd than to actually
[40:05.720 --> 40:10.440]  give the right answer and be correct which kind of ties into what we were saying yeah and that's
[40:10.440 --> 40:16.040]  a small scale example listen to this big scale example from CBS today experts selfie obsessed
[40:16.040 --> 40:22.280]  millennials increasingly opt for plastic surgery and this is from CBS that says the pressure is so
[40:22.280 --> 40:27.000]  much for some that plastic surgeons say selfies are actually boosting their business this is a
[40:27.000 --> 40:31.560]  quote from a doctor I see a lot more people coming into my office and the answer to the question
[40:31.560 --> 40:37.160]  what bothers you and why did you decide to come see me surprisingly enough is I saw a selfie of
[40:37.160 --> 40:43.720]  myself and I hated it I have to fix it said Dr. Nicholas Nikolov Nikolov is currently consulting
[40:43.720 --> 40:49.960]  with 23-year-old model Candice Worsten who said she hates the shadows under her eyes in her selfies
[40:49.960 --> 40:55.240]  psychologist Sandy Hotchkiss says the boost has too many young people getting addicted to selfies
[40:55.240 --> 41:01.160]  quote our values lean towards the shallow end of value pool where things like physical beauty and
[41:01.160 --> 41:05.400]  material success are more important than things like compassion courage and kindness she said
[41:05.400 --> 41:12.200]  that it's 100% true yeah and if there's more studies and more information on this too like
[41:12.200 --> 41:19.880]  compulsive texting takes toll on teenagers what's happening is there is a wave of self-absorption
[41:19.880 --> 41:26.360]  that rids human compassion rids human empathy rids consciousness rids passion rids the ability to
[41:26.360 --> 41:33.880]  communicate and relate to other human beings it's almost like a self-forming void of communication
[41:33.880 --> 41:37.560]  and we and we're just locked in and we're all victims of this by the way we're not above this
[41:37.560 --> 41:40.680]  we text all the time too we're locked in our phones sometimes at dinner we'll be looking at
[41:40.680 --> 41:44.440]  our phone you know we're not sitting here judging random people saying we're the best smart people
[41:44.440 --> 41:49.080]  in the world but these people are getting plastic surgery over their selfies they're losing sleep
[41:49.080 --> 41:53.960]  this is the new york times teenagers use text messaging more than any other mode of communication
[41:53.960 --> 41:58.600]  so it may be hard to tell but youngsters who check their phones continually snap if you interrupt
[41:58.600 --> 42:04.200]  them and are so preoccupied with texting they skip sleep and don't get their work done may be
[42:04.200 --> 42:09.720]  compulsive textors a new study says for girls compulsive texting is more than just a distraction
[42:09.720 --> 42:15.560]  it is associated with lower academic performance so they studied 408th graders and 11th graders
[42:15.560 --> 42:19.640]  and they were finding that they were losing sleep because they had to keep texting they couldn't
[42:19.640 --> 42:24.440]  even go to sleep they were texting all day ignoring everything and losing sleep and feeling like crap
[42:24.440 --> 42:30.120]  the next day because they couldn't stop texting no I mean this is completely insane I went on
[42:30.120 --> 42:36.920]  holiday to the Caribbean earlier this year and now literally a form of babysitting is giving a child
[42:36.920 --> 42:42.200]  an iPad and just like pushing them to the back of the room even in like a restaurant where you
[42:42.200 --> 42:47.160]  know it's supposed to be family time this is your vacation this is your two weeks where you have time
[42:47.160 --> 42:52.520]  to spend together with no distractions no work and they just give the you know six seven-year-old
[42:52.520 --> 42:59.880]  kid an iPad ignore them for the whole night again social media the study show is making people
[42:59.880 --> 43:06.440]  unhappy selfies I don't even take I probably take like one selfie every six months because obviously
[43:06.440 --> 43:13.080]  we need to carry our information via our personalities but these people who most of them don't even
[43:13.080 --> 43:17.960]  have many followers on Facebook or Twitter well they're posting to themselves is the weird thing
[43:17.960 --> 43:21.080]  too if you go to the social media sites like Instagram they'll have like three followers
[43:21.080 --> 43:26.600]  they're really posting to themselves so it's all a self-fulfilling weird prophecy of self-delusion
[43:26.600 --> 43:30.360]  because they act like they're posting to millions of people because that's what their favorite
[43:30.360 --> 43:34.760]  celebrities are doing so they want to be their iconic favorite celebrities but in fact they're
[43:34.760 --> 43:39.080]  posting to no one and if they don't look a little bit good they judge themselves and they have this
[43:39.080 --> 43:45.640]  weird cycle of self-hatred and it's all is coming out of this and it's like phone thubbing have you
[43:45.640 --> 43:51.640]  heard about this no so it's called fubbing it's when you're sitting with someone at a dinner table
[43:51.640 --> 43:55.640]  or you're in a relationship or whatever and you're just on your phone all the time yeah and it's
[43:55.640 --> 44:01.320]  it's ruining relationships to the point where philly.com had to release an article how to keep
[44:01.320 --> 44:05.880]  phone snubbing or fubbing from ruining your love life and it's like a serious article
[44:05.880 --> 44:12.280]  and it talks about all the ways we can stop like we can start making the phone game where if someone
[44:12.280 --> 44:17.240]  starts fubbing at dinner they have to pay for the bill like people are being proactive because
[44:17.240 --> 44:22.360]  people's relationships according to the study are being destroyed from people sitting on their phones
[44:22.360 --> 44:27.080]  not talking to each other yeah and imagine growing up with this yeah we just talked about oh here
[44:27.080 --> 44:32.440]  kids go play with your iphone or whatever imagine growing up with an iphone from age two and that's
[44:32.440 --> 44:36.760]  all you're locked into the borg system your communication skills are going to be zero
[44:36.760 --> 44:43.160]  yeah and you know to clarify there's nothing wrong with being on your phone when like for
[44:43.160 --> 44:47.160]  example you're on public transport when you're waiting for something else to happen there's a
[44:47.160 --> 44:53.560]  time and place to be on your phone but with that for example i mean i've been out and seen couples
[44:53.560 --> 44:58.600]  who are obviously on dates with each other and you know sat opposite each other i'm sat behind
[44:58.600 --> 45:03.720]  them so i can see what they're doing on their phone and like the girl is literally on tinder
[45:03.720 --> 45:09.080]  trying to find another date the day she's on a date it's it's gone so insane and yeah you know we're
[45:09.080 --> 45:13.080]  not judging people for using their phone i use my phone all the time it's just i hate the fact that i
[45:13.080 --> 45:17.400]  use my phone all the time as well and i know it is a bad thing to do and i know it's bad to be locked
[45:17.400 --> 45:22.200]  into all these systems not dimensions is tracking everything you do when you agree to install those
[45:22.200 --> 45:26.680]  apps on if you read the five print on your phone it says yes we track whatever we track everything
[45:26.680 --> 45:32.840]  you do all of this is just designed to be locked into the complete borg system period and at least
[45:32.840 --> 45:37.960]  you know put it in airplane mode before you go to bed right i mean you know my girlfriend has it on
[45:37.960 --> 45:43.880]  a bedside table has it turned on so every time it buzzes at like three four a.m it wakes her up
[45:43.880 --> 45:48.360]  and studies have shown that if you look at your phone right before sleeping it fires up different
[45:48.360 --> 45:53.000]  areas of your brain that prevent you from being able to get to sleep yeah and it stops the production
[45:53.000 --> 45:57.560]  of melatonin because if you think about it we weren't meant to sit and watch artificial lights
[45:57.560 --> 46:01.720]  all night like the computer screen before we go to bed and that stops the production of melatonin
[46:01.720 --> 46:05.000]  because light interferes with the production of melatonin so if you sleep with the light on too
[46:05.000 --> 46:08.520]  but also an electronic device you're not getting the melatonin you need and you're not going to
[46:08.520 --> 46:12.600]  be able to sleep well you're going to feel like crap the next morning and then that is why we have
[46:12.600 --> 46:17.000]  the computer syndrome which is where everyone's on the computer still two a.m at night and they go
[46:17.000 --> 46:21.240]  to bed and they don't can't sleep properly they can't get the rest they need the rem sleep
[46:21.240 --> 46:25.960]  and it's just it is messing up the human body completely and it's making people depressed i mean
[46:25.960 --> 46:32.200]  all the all the studies show facebook and twitter because facebook for example is a highlight real
[46:32.200 --> 46:37.880]  of somebody's life other people look at that and think my god they're having such an exciting life
[46:37.880 --> 46:41.160]  they're out all the time they're doing all these different activities they're meeting all these
[46:41.160 --> 46:47.160]  different people that's not on a day-to-day basis right those are the highlights so then they get
[46:47.160 --> 46:53.640]  jealous they get insecure that they're you know not as much socially welcoming socially accepted
[46:53.640 --> 46:58.040]  as the individuals who are posting all these photos on facebook and it makes them depressed
[46:58.040 --> 47:04.200]  the studies have shown that we waste an inordinate amount of time on social media i'm guilty of
[47:04.200 --> 47:07.960]  that basically just arguing with people we're trying to get a message out and you know i think
[47:07.960 --> 47:11.960]  it all also ties in with political correctness we're talking about that the other day as well
[47:11.960 --> 47:19.800]  all of this is essentially a template to change society for better for worse right with facebook
[47:19.800 --> 47:26.040]  with instagram with even social communications on the text base level all this is a template to
[47:26.040 --> 47:31.000]  reach other people and whatever message you choose to get to others is your choice obviously but we
[47:31.000 --> 47:36.280]  can of course be propagandized into spreading different messages whether it's political correctness
[47:36.280 --> 47:40.760]  or whatever and all these social platforms it seems have different audience types but we're
[47:40.760 --> 47:45.800]  talking about something like tumblr versus like facebook versus all these things what has happened
[47:45.800 --> 47:52.200]  is political correctness has seeped in and it has become a hot social topic to discuss and has
[47:52.200 --> 47:56.600]  become something and you're going to talk about more more about this in the next hour with uh
[47:56.600 --> 48:03.240]  gadsat but political correctness is the virus of social media that i believe is thriving you
[48:03.240 --> 48:07.880]  know when we talked about this the other day as well yeah it's it's thriving through this outrage
[48:07.880 --> 48:14.680]  culture that has been cultivated by social media it's an echo chamber whereby one opinion one
[48:14.680 --> 48:20.920]  judgment of somebody's behavior or words can be amplified to such an extent that it goes completely
[48:20.920 --> 48:25.240]  out of proportion and again most of these people aren't going to do anything they're not actually
[48:25.240 --> 48:29.640]  going to call anybody up they're not going to go to a protest they're not going to do anything physical
[48:29.640 --> 48:33.640]  they're just going to tweet out a hashtag which is very much what happened with the black lives
[48:33.640 --> 48:38.760]  matter movement which we're going to talk about but it creates this echo chamber that seems so
[48:38.760 --> 48:43.640]  intimidating to somebody who's on the receiving end of it which is why these people apologize
[48:43.640 --> 48:48.440]  over and over again for making for making politically incorrect statements when the true
[48:48.440 --> 48:54.040]  course of action and the only successful course of action should be to stand by what you said
[48:54.040 --> 49:00.440]  and not be intimidated by these social media outrage mobs but the power has devolved it's
[49:00.440 --> 49:05.800]  gone from being in the hands of the state now it's in the hands of these outrage mobs exercising
[49:05.800 --> 49:11.960]  that power through the echo chamber of twitter and basically people need to stand up and realize
[49:11.960 --> 49:15.800]  that it doesn't have as much power as they think it does right it's like the most radically
[49:15.800 --> 49:20.440]  insane groups tend to throw some of the most power for whatever reason people need to understand
[49:20.440 --> 49:25.080]  that we want real talk the public wants real talk that's why trump is surging in the polls it
[49:25.080 --> 49:29.080]  doesn't even matter his policies to most people they like the fact that he does some real talk
[49:29.080 --> 49:32.760]  some real talk if you look at the biggest youtube personalities you look at the biggest
[49:32.760 --> 49:37.800]  commentator personalities including yourself paul everyone wants real talk and guess what
[49:37.800 --> 49:42.440]  i love everybody i really do i'm going to say some politically incorrect things sometimes
[49:42.440 --> 49:46.200]  because it's important to reach people uh we're all going to make mistakes sometimes
[49:46.760 --> 49:50.920]  we're we're putting ourselves in the public platform recording videos trying our best to
[49:50.920 --> 49:53.560]  help people we're going to make mistakes we're going to make some bad decisions we're going to do
[49:53.560 --> 49:58.920]  some stupid things but at least it's real at least it's 100 in the right you know message
[49:58.920 --> 50:03.800]  we're passionate about it and people want that they don't want the fake carpet cardboard cut
[50:03.800 --> 50:07.480]  out they don't want that that there's that's there's no room for that that's not real that's not
[50:07.480 --> 50:12.600]  invigorating that's not thriving the media system that's not doing anything when we sit there and
[50:12.600 --> 50:17.160]  we have to script everything we say this is completely teleprompter free completely unscripted
[50:17.160 --> 50:21.400]  i have three articles here and we just went off of all this for over 30 plus minutes really
[50:22.120 --> 50:25.720]  and went into these subjects that matter and people like that and people resonate with that
[50:25.720 --> 50:30.040]  and they want inspiration they don't want someone to sit up here and say well we we don't want to
[50:30.040 --> 50:34.760]  say anything that we don't mean that would offend someone that's the age of political correctness
[50:34.760 --> 50:41.240]  is dying and political correctness is based on self-censorship it's it's been completely frightened
[50:41.240 --> 50:46.200]  to death to even speak for fear of saying something that might offend somebody that's why it's so
[50:46.200 --> 50:51.160]  pervasive that's why it's so insidious we'll be back to talk about it with your calls after the

[55:10.280 --> 55:17.880]  kevin in florida you're on the air go ahead kevin thank you so much paul i appreciate you
[55:17.880 --> 55:23.400]  taking my call my question actually kind of ties in to what you and i you were talking about earlier
[55:23.400 --> 55:29.480]  with people and uh just being so ignorant and dumb um i work as a manager in a retail
[55:29.480 --> 55:34.760]  chain so i deal with people from all over the world and i totally remand i feel like
[55:34.760 --> 55:39.400]  the population is so dumb down the majority of the people have no idea what's going on
[55:39.400 --> 55:44.200]  and um they believe everything the mainstream media tells them which is sad there's no free
[55:44.200 --> 55:50.760]  thinkers anymore nobody wants to get outside the box and express themselves and my question for you
[55:50.760 --> 55:55.960]  was how is that going to change or is it going to change and what is it going to take to change
[55:55.960 --> 56:01.160]  that because i feel like it's going to take an outright revolution for people to get back what
[56:01.160 --> 56:08.200]  they rightfully deserve well i think we can't get too disheartened we can't get too down hearted
[56:08.200 --> 56:13.400]  about it because you do go out amongst the general population and you get this sense that everybody
[56:13.400 --> 56:18.120]  is dumb down but then you look on the internet you know you look at youtube and people are
[56:18.120 --> 56:23.160]  really becoming more aware of how they're being manipulated trust in government is at all time
[56:23.160 --> 56:29.720]  lows trust in mainstream media is at all time lows so then that creates a vacuum for a new
[56:29.720 --> 56:34.520]  source of information to come in and have an impact which you know is not necessarily always good
[56:34.520 --> 56:40.840]  there's dis info in the alternative media but at least people have lost faith in the established
[56:40.840 --> 56:45.560]  traditions of government and media at least there's some kind of vacuum that we can go in and fill
[56:45.560 --> 56:49.720]  so that's the positive that i take from that anthony i would agree with that and i would also
[56:49.720 --> 56:53.960]  say that more and more i do see millions of people saying hey something's wrong with this system
[56:53.960 --> 56:59.320]  getting informed about it and rising up i would also say that at some point in pretty much all of
[56:59.320 --> 57:04.280]  our lives i'm not aware of anyone that was born with the understanding of what was going on
[57:04.280 --> 57:09.000]  we were one of those quote unquote dumbed down people i know i was when we were 18 i mean i didn't
[57:09.000 --> 57:14.200]  know anything i was yeah give people the chance you can't just write them off right exactly i don't
[57:14.200 --> 57:18.840]  like the idea that these idiots out here i hate them all i mean look obviously there's some dumb
[57:18.840 --> 57:23.160]  down people obviously there's some people that need help it's up to us to actually help them
[57:23.160 --> 57:28.120]  as opposed to criticize these people and say and i'm not saying you're doing that by the way kevin
[57:28.120 --> 57:31.960]  i understand what you're saying trust me i completely understand but i'm saying it's our
[57:31.960 --> 57:36.760]  mission to try and help these people and awaken them up to the level that hopefully we are and
[57:36.760 --> 57:41.240]  maybe you know there's more for us to learn as well but at the same time i see millions of
[57:41.240 --> 57:45.560]  millions of millions of people waking up saying that something is wrong and i see a solution on the
[57:45.560 --> 57:52.040]  horizon and i think part of it is again going back to what we said earlier people don't talk to each
[57:52.040 --> 57:57.160]  other so you do you just immediately assume that somebody's dumb and somebody's ignorant and doesn't
[57:57.160 --> 58:01.720]  know about any of these issues but then when you actually converse with people interact with them
[58:01.720 --> 58:06.200]  as we did up on that mountain when these this group of young people probably about you know
[58:06.200 --> 58:11.400]  16 17 18 approached us simply because they were resonating with what we were saying and that's
[58:11.400 --> 58:15.960]  the next generation so you can't get too downhearted about it you've got to realize that you have to
[58:15.960 --> 58:21.160]  interact with people to know where they're coming from and there is hope and that's why info wars
[58:21.160 --> 58:26.440]  has grown to be such a huge operation so that's why we're going to continue reaching out to people
[58:26.440 --> 58:32.280]  trying to expand into different areas more of your calls coming up after the break i'm paul joseph

[1:00:30.280 --> 1:00:35.720]  second hour of the alex jones show we've got gad sad coming up at the bottom of the hour he's a
[1:00:35.720 --> 1:00:40.760]  psychologist he's a behavioral scientist he's going to talk about the motivations behind
[1:00:40.760 --> 1:00:45.320]  human behavior why people embrace political correctness and what we can do to counter that
[1:00:45.960 --> 1:00:51.640]  basically we want to take some positive calls there's a lot of negativity around about you
[1:00:51.640 --> 1:00:56.200]  know and we embrace some of that too let's be fair you know everybody's dumb nobody's awake
[1:00:56.200 --> 1:01:00.200]  nobody's paying attention but obviously they are otherwise we wouldn't have got to this position
[1:01:00.200 --> 1:01:06.520]  obviously people are losing faith in establishment you know institutions drudgerreport.com has a
[1:01:06.520 --> 1:01:13.560]  headline shock poll clinton loses to any republican and remember back at bilderberg she was the
[1:01:13.560 --> 1:01:19.720]  chosen one she was the candidate for the establishment for 2016 within months she's
[1:01:19.720 --> 1:01:25.080]  completely collapsed now she's basically going to lose to anyone that runs against her which
[1:01:25.080 --> 1:01:30.920]  again is why the gop establishment is now trying to sink trump because at least to some extent he's
[1:01:30.920 --> 1:01:37.240]  a maverick he's unpredictable and that's intolerable to control freaks so again people are losing faith
[1:01:37.240 --> 1:01:42.440]  they're looking for alternatives we have to exploit this and turn it into a positive
[1:01:43.000 --> 1:01:46.360]  we're going to go to orlean in canada you're on the air go ahead
[1:01:48.440 --> 1:01:56.600]  hi there hey go ahead what's your point so i'm back from the dead and i'm looking for revenge
[1:01:56.600 --> 1:02:06.120]  with my arsenal of empowering information good and what's your arsenal what's in your arsenal
[1:02:07.240 --> 1:02:16.840]  so i have 10 steps to increase your consciousness okay from the most fundamental the most foundational
[1:02:16.840 --> 1:02:23.000]  to the most powerful and the most high spirited okay just give it give us the top two go ahead
[1:02:23.000 --> 1:02:29.560]  the top two yeah okay i'll go through it very quickly one forced breathing you want to get
[1:02:29.560 --> 1:02:35.560]  oxygen in your system you can't get oxygen if your nose is plugged use some nasal spray get
[1:02:35.560 --> 1:02:42.280]  oxygen in your system number two water distilled water clean water uh the cleanest water you can
[1:02:42.280 --> 1:02:48.600]  find get water in your system very important if you talk number three if you talk to uh
[1:02:48.600 --> 1:02:57.080]  uh if you talk to marathon runners they they carb load so tropical fruit will give you
[1:02:57.880 --> 1:03:07.400]  intense amounts of energy fruit juice uh fresh freshly juiced fruits number four would be
[1:03:07.400 --> 1:03:15.400]  amino acids you want to get these from fish turkey eggs way you want to avoid dairy well
[1:03:15.400 --> 1:03:21.400]  let's talk about this anthony you're the expert on this clean healthy water fresh fruit back 10
[1:03:21.400 --> 1:03:27.000]  15 years ago my diet used to be pretty horrible i always felt like groggy no energy whatsoever
[1:03:27.000 --> 1:03:31.960]  as soon as i got into you know eating healthy drinking clean fresh water everything picked up
[1:03:31.960 --> 1:03:37.320]  my attitude picked up and that is really a starting point which everyone can grasp on to to begin this
[1:03:37.320 --> 1:03:42.680]  journey right it's true and i would also say people need to start treating their brain like
[1:03:42.680 --> 1:03:47.720]  they do their stomachs stop feeding it junk yeah right so the consumption that we get on a daily
[1:03:47.720 --> 1:03:52.840]  basis from our body and our brain is is very similar for watching the mainstream media all day
[1:03:52.840 --> 1:03:58.760]  and stupid television shows we're feeding our brain junk but if we're eating junk we're feeding
[1:03:58.760 --> 1:04:03.240]  our bodies junk and there's a correlation because we know the gut is the second brain we know the
[1:04:03.240 --> 1:04:07.560]  gut correlates with the brain it sends nerve signals we know the heart has neurons in it as well
[1:04:07.560 --> 1:04:13.480]  but overall yeah if one of the number one things you can do for example is wake up within 30 minutes
[1:04:13.480 --> 1:04:18.040]  eat 30 grams of protein it's been found to boost metabolism make you feel better lose weight
[1:04:18.040 --> 1:04:22.680]  throughout the day another thing you can do is drink warm lemon water in the morning to super
[1:04:22.680 --> 1:04:26.760]  charge your body i mean there's numerous things i mean orlean says he's come back from the dead
[1:04:26.760 --> 1:04:31.480]  so i don't think i'll have that type of esoteric knowledge but i do i know a few things about health
[1:04:31.480 --> 1:04:37.400]  so really just making an effort is key i believe okay we'll be back with more of your calls after
[1:04:37.400 --> 1:04:45.240]  the break we've got cole erica patrick and phil 1800 259 92 31 anthony gucciardi in studio again

[1:08:23.800 --> 1:08:27.640]  we're back live it's the alex jones show with me your house called joseph what's an
[1:08:27.640 --> 1:08:33.240]  and anthony gucciardi more of your calls coming up in a moment but we were just handed this story
[1:08:33.240 --> 1:08:39.400]  which is quite amazing it ties into what we were talking about regarding social media about 10
[1:08:39.400 --> 1:08:43.640]  20 minutes ago anthony what's the story we were talking about the collapse of society earlier
[1:08:43.640 --> 1:08:49.320]  and the delusion of fubbing which is basically where you're on your cell phone so much that
[1:08:49.320 --> 1:08:53.400]  it ruins your relationships and how people's egos are destroyed by social media likes and
[1:08:53.400 --> 1:08:58.520]  everything like that here's a story which came out in the daily mail it's actually horribly
[1:08:58.520 --> 1:09:05.080]  disturbing but so ridiculous newly wed wife 20 hangs herself after her indian husband takes away
[1:09:05.080 --> 1:09:10.200]  her phone because she was always on facebook and what's app her husband said she spent too
[1:09:10.200 --> 1:09:14.520]  much time on facebook and what's app he took her phone during a row after which she locked herself
[1:09:14.520 --> 1:09:20.040]  in her room when he later kicked down the door he found she had committed suicide and this is to me
[1:09:20.920 --> 1:09:27.320]  it's it's obviously disturbing um it's ridiculous but it's just a view into the true
[1:09:27.320 --> 1:09:32.680]  ridiculousness of how some people not all people but some people just like paul talked about a study
[1:09:32.680 --> 1:09:36.360]  earlier when everyone would go along with what everyone else was saying some people take it to
[1:09:36.360 --> 1:09:41.960]  the next level obviously this woman was most likely mentally ill but we have to remember
[1:09:41.960 --> 1:09:46.440]  that when people really get addicted to these kind of things they take it seriously and on a smaller
[1:09:46.440 --> 1:09:51.320]  level people are taking it seriously when they post their selfies and they have to get plastic
[1:09:51.320 --> 1:09:56.680]  surgery because they think they look ugly i mean this society is becoming so self-absorbed
[1:09:56.680 --> 1:10:03.160]  so sick that people are killing themselves because their cell phones have been taken away not not in
[1:10:03.160 --> 1:10:08.520]  a large scale obviously this is apparently an isolated incident but it did happen and it's
[1:10:08.520 --> 1:10:15.160]  very disturbing and there's also a huge problem with narcissism again which drives depression
[1:10:15.160 --> 1:10:19.800]  you know i know people that are depressed and you can clearly see that it's due to their narcissism
[1:10:19.800 --> 1:10:25.720]  and it's due to their goals not being fulfilled because they spend all their time on facebook
[1:10:25.720 --> 1:10:31.640]  posting selfies trying to draw attention to their appearance while not actually achieving
[1:10:31.640 --> 1:10:35.960]  anything in their careers and what they want to do with their lives well that's why there's so many
[1:10:35.960 --> 1:10:41.960]  models these days too unfortunately because mainly females they grow up thinking that
[1:10:41.960 --> 1:10:45.800]  in this society it's there it's their looks that are going to get them places their looks it's not
[1:10:45.800 --> 1:10:50.600]  about their output what they actually do it's kind of it's kind of as above so below though because
[1:10:50.600 --> 1:10:55.400]  this country does nothing to that we don't produce anything anymore well the citizens don't really
[1:10:55.400 --> 1:11:01.160]  produce anything anymore on a pretty large scale as well it's almost like we're outsourcing all of
[1:11:01.160 --> 1:11:05.800]  our our responsibilities as human beings as well it's like our country production is shut off so
[1:11:05.800 --> 1:11:11.480]  we as human individuals aren't doing that much either and again that ties into social media
[1:11:11.480 --> 1:11:16.440]  because you have this phenomenon of virtue signaling which is basically people sending out
[1:11:16.440 --> 1:11:22.200]  hashtags people backing politically correct causes simply to earn social brownie points
[1:11:22.200 --> 1:11:28.440]  amongst their liberal progressive friends without actually going out or attending a single protest
[1:11:28.440 --> 1:11:34.120]  writing a single letter you know filming a single youtube video they do it to be cool they do it to
[1:11:34.120 --> 1:11:40.360]  be trendy they do it to earn social approval from their friends and it's it's this lazy click you
[1:11:40.360 --> 1:11:46.280]  know hashtag activism that is completely nebulous and meaningless in the long term but they need
[1:11:46.280 --> 1:11:51.880]  to do it to get that social approval and that's why we have people obsessed with selfies we have
[1:11:51.880 --> 1:11:57.240]  models on instagram all they do is post you know 20 30 pictures of themselves a day but
[1:11:57.240 --> 1:12:02.200]  you know some people are receptive to that some people have success with that and again to create
[1:12:02.200 --> 1:12:07.560]  that kind of society that has no substance no actual conviction with people following through
[1:12:07.560 --> 1:12:13.480]  on their beliefs that's exactly what we have to counter on a daily basis let's go to more of your
[1:12:13.480 --> 1:12:18.600]  calls let's go to dave in california who wants to talk about political correctness dave you're on
[1:12:18.600 --> 1:12:26.520]  the air go ahead hey thanks paul it's good to talk to you man good to talk to you okay so uh on your
[1:12:26.520 --> 1:12:31.320]  book order out of this is off subject but on your book order out of chaos is that still available
[1:12:31.320 --> 1:12:38.120]  i read most of it a long time ago and then i lost it in a computer crash it's still available on
[1:12:38.120 --> 1:12:44.280]  prismplanet.tv you can get the pdf so you can go on prismplanet.tv login it'll be on the books section
[1:12:44.280 --> 1:12:51.080]  excellent i will do that thank you and on their on the subject of political correctness and insulting
[1:12:51.080 --> 1:12:59.800]  people uh i have a small facebook following mostly just my real friends but i find that i can go to
[1:13:00.840 --> 1:13:07.480]  sites that firefighters hang out at lots of them and i will usually a few times a year
[1:13:07.480 --> 1:13:15.240]  uh put out a bunch of what i consider to be really relevant 9-11 uh issues uh in particular lately
[1:13:15.240 --> 1:13:21.960]  i've been uh focusing on paul uh kevin ryan stuff which i find fascinating and i love the fact that
[1:13:21.960 --> 1:13:28.840]  he actually fingers the real culprits of 9-11 i'd like to see you guys get him on if possible
[1:13:28.840 --> 1:13:35.880]  but i never retract anything i don't care if it insults people or not unless it's in error
[1:13:35.880 --> 1:13:41.880]  you know i i occasionally get snagged by something when i'm out there you know i mean that that is
[1:13:41.880 --> 1:13:48.040]  the point of this twitter outrage phenomenon the power lies for them for the outrage mob for
[1:13:48.040 --> 1:13:52.920]  the professionally offended the power lies in you relenting and backing down and retracting
[1:13:52.920 --> 1:13:58.360]  now of course unless you've made an error never back down never apologize you can actually read
[1:13:58.360 --> 1:14:03.240]  a book called so you've been publicly shown by john ronson which explains this phenomenon
[1:14:03.240 --> 1:14:08.360]  the people who got fired who lost their jobs whose lives completely melted down as a result of being
[1:14:08.360 --> 1:14:14.840]  publicly shamed are the ones who apologized the ones who stood up for their beliefs and basically
[1:14:14.840 --> 1:14:19.640]  told everybody you know where to get off and said i'm not going to back down i'm not going to apologize
[1:14:19.640 --> 1:14:24.520]  they're the ones who went on to prosper they actually had better lives after the whole
[1:14:24.520 --> 1:14:29.640]  you know fiasco so that's the key that's the answer to this social outrage phenomenon
[1:14:29.640 --> 1:14:34.920]  never back down never apologize right anthony and if you make mistake that's fine just be real
[1:14:34.920 --> 1:14:39.560]  don't apologize for being real and ultimately as you were saying yeah social media can be
[1:14:39.560 --> 1:14:42.680]  definitely a tool to inform people and help people it's just we're so locked into the
[1:14:42.680 --> 1:14:47.160]  borg system we're not judging people for using it we're just saying at the same time though
[1:14:47.160 --> 1:14:53.080]  it of course is really a cannibalistic sick narcissistic based system
[1:14:53.080 --> 1:14:59.960]  colin georgia you're on the air go ahead col well those are watching how you doing man
[1:14:59.960 --> 1:15:06.440]  good what's your point today uh i was wanting to talk about how uh tia and uh georgia village
[1:15:06.440 --> 1:15:13.320]  connection in the drug trafficking connection sure go ahead it's just kind of right about uh
[1:15:13.320 --> 1:15:20.920]  say i think i came around many years ago my cousin has been in the military he was in marines he's
[1:15:20.920 --> 1:15:27.160]  talking about he just brought up a point talking about how he just talked about how oh georgia
[1:15:27.160 --> 1:15:34.120]  bush is connected to the the cia and they bring the drugs in i'm just like what did that come from
[1:15:34.120 --> 1:15:37.640]  well there's actually a new movie out which you were telling me about anthony about
[1:15:37.640 --> 1:15:42.280]  the cia involvement in the drug trade tells the choreo i thought it was a great film
[1:15:43.560 --> 1:15:47.720]  essentially it talks about the cia smuggling in drugs and their control of the whole system
[1:15:47.720 --> 1:15:53.480]  and how the facade is kept over the different agencies that help work towards it and it's
[1:15:53.480 --> 1:15:58.120]  really quite well done and i think it's really quite mainstream now that the cia ships and the
[1:15:58.120 --> 1:16:02.440]  drugs and i feel i feel like that's not really that much of a debated point besides those who are
[1:16:02.440 --> 1:16:07.880]  ignorant to the true information about it and if there's a choice between seeing sickario and
[1:16:08.520 --> 1:16:15.880]  the martian definitely sickario yes definitely choose that one okay mr positive in tennessee
[1:16:15.880 --> 1:16:21.000]  that's the kind of call we want mr positive you're on the air go ahead good afternoon
[1:16:21.000 --> 1:16:28.040]  gentlemen and how are you today good how's it going uh doing great uh you guys i feel privileged to
[1:16:28.040 --> 1:16:33.080]  be speaking with you because you're two of my favorite correspondents although not as easy on
[1:16:33.080 --> 1:16:39.320]  the eyes as macadoo um and that might be politically incorrect and i how dare you i'm not going to
[1:16:39.320 --> 1:16:45.480]  apologize for that is this the studio likes the kinder on some people and not the kind on others
[1:16:45.480 --> 1:16:49.560]  definitely me i'm sure i look a lot better on youtube okay i just want to get that in there
[1:16:49.560 --> 1:16:55.400]  go ahead what's your point i don't know about the ten pounds but anyway um couple of things first of
[1:16:55.400 --> 1:17:02.120]  all it strikes me because i have a teenager and i noticed today obviously having been a teenage boy
[1:17:02.120 --> 1:17:10.520]  at one point how awkward it is or was for me just to talk to a girl in person before texting
[1:17:10.520 --> 1:17:18.680]  and now with the texting situation i'm finding more and more of these teenagers they they have
[1:17:18.680 --> 1:17:25.240]  boyfriends and girlfriends that they've never really even verbally spoken with um and when
[1:17:25.240 --> 1:17:32.520]  they never go on a date they've never been on a date they all they know is texting and it as
[1:17:32.520 --> 1:17:39.720]  awkward as it was for me as a teenage boy to speak to a girl now the teenagers just it's a barrier
[1:17:39.720 --> 1:17:48.120]  that they can't even get through because of this thing that we've you know been offered and created
[1:17:48.760 --> 1:17:57.160]  um really it's horrifying that these kids just maybe that's a firm uh a form of uh population
[1:17:57.160 --> 1:18:05.960]  control at some level too but really it's made these kids so socially awkward that it's frightening
[1:18:05.960 --> 1:18:13.080]  yeah well i mean i've noticed that phenomenon too and you know you're wasting your time basically
[1:18:13.080 --> 1:18:17.560]  because you know if you resonate with someone only by talking to them you can get an inclination
[1:18:17.560 --> 1:18:22.360]  through text show but you have to actually talk to them verbally there's no way to read what they're
[1:18:22.360 --> 1:18:27.320]  saying in the text 90% of communication is total body language and the way you say something it's
[1:18:27.320 --> 1:18:33.560]  just like on this radio show if i were to say i love president obama versus yeah i love president
[1:18:33.560 --> 1:18:38.200]  obama it's two completely different statements you have no idea what you're saying in text a lot of
[1:18:38.200 --> 1:18:41.880]  the times that's why we had to have emotes and everything like that instead of actually just
[1:18:41.880 --> 1:18:45.960]  communicating with people and have you noticed by the way when you call someone on the phone they
[1:18:45.960 --> 1:18:51.480]  almost act like how dare you right like how often do you really talk to people on the phone anymore
[1:18:51.480 --> 1:18:57.560]  it's all texting or facebook messenger and and this this caller is 100 correct because the new
[1:18:57.560 --> 1:19:03.240]  generation they don't have to learn how to communicate in the in the flesh they just communicate
[1:19:03.240 --> 1:19:07.880]  and things they say by the way are pretty hardcore in text because it's almost like a black uh dark
[1:19:07.880 --> 1:19:12.520]  void it's like it's talking to yourself you're not actually talking there's no real responsibility
[1:19:12.520 --> 1:19:17.000]  for what you say but that also amplifies misunderstandings because you can't actually
[1:19:17.000 --> 1:19:21.720]  communicate yourself properly and then when these kids go out into the real world and try to get jobs
[1:19:21.720 --> 1:19:26.680]  where they have to physically communicate with people and express themselves they're completely
[1:19:26.680 --> 1:19:31.160]  crippled right yeah absolutely they don't know what to do because they've had no training in that sense
[1:19:31.160 --> 1:19:38.520]  they've had an online relationship or text-based relationship or whatever and i'm i'm i'm sorry
[1:19:38.520 --> 1:19:45.240]  for them because growing up without that capability is really depressing interesting call mr positive
[1:19:45.240 --> 1:19:50.440]  we'll explore more of that after the break with some more of your calls also gad sad coming up in

[1:24:31.320 --> 1:24:36.280]  coming up after the break and he's gonna really break down the origins of political correctness
[1:24:36.280 --> 1:24:43.080]  the true agenda behind it it's not just about being nice to people being sensitive making sure you
[1:24:43.080 --> 1:24:50.520]  don't offend them this is based deeply in political reeducate reeducation social engineering
[1:24:50.520 --> 1:24:55.320]  we're going to delve into it with gad sad at the bottom of the hour we're going to go to a couple
[1:24:55.320 --> 1:25:00.760]  more of your calls right now let's go to thomas in texas positive news coming out of the tyranny
[1:25:00.760 --> 1:25:06.920]  thomas go ahead hey paul um you know i wanted to make the point about you know they're speeding
[1:25:06.920 --> 1:25:11.560]  up this tyranny being more open and blatant about it but one thing i noticed was every
[1:25:11.560 --> 1:25:16.920]  anniversary of 9 11 i try to talk to people about one world trade center seven and i was
[1:25:16.920 --> 1:25:21.960]  in i was surprised by how receptive people were to talking about it this year versus any other
[1:25:21.960 --> 1:25:28.040]  and i was wondering if you guys experienced that same uh that same thing i haven't really
[1:25:28.040 --> 1:25:33.480]  covered 9 11 probably for years now because you know that whole movement kind of devolved into
[1:25:33.480 --> 1:25:38.360]  different aspects of the quote truth movement but what have you found with that anthony personally
[1:25:38.360 --> 1:25:42.760]  when i talk to someone about you know whatever topic i'm passionate about at the moment whether
[1:25:42.760 --> 1:25:48.200]  it's health or whatever which i mainly try to focus on i find that we are tangibly succeeding
[1:25:48.200 --> 1:25:53.480]  in all avenues even if it's just someone who's interested in it and i talk to them about any
[1:25:53.480 --> 1:25:57.800]  subject and they look it up and they find out about it that is 90 percent of the people that
[1:25:57.800 --> 1:26:02.200]  i'm speaking to there that are first of all interested right so obviously we have that
[1:26:02.200 --> 1:26:05.640]  percentage of the population that doesn't care that's going to believe whatever obama says or
[1:26:05.640 --> 1:26:11.000]  whatever jeb bush says or whatever their favorite icon is but then there are those people that really
[1:26:11.000 --> 1:26:14.920]  want to know about something and some of them already know about it but the big percentage
[1:26:14.920 --> 1:26:19.320]  will say hey i haven't heard about that let me look that up and then they find out and they say wow
[1:26:19.320 --> 1:26:22.920]  and that ultimately causes kind of a fisher effect and they realize all the other stuff
[1:26:22.920 --> 1:26:28.120]  that they've been told may not be true as well so yeah i think i think as things get worse things
[1:26:28.120 --> 1:26:33.560]  get better in a weird way because it's so much more apparent as the society gets more and more
[1:26:33.560 --> 1:26:38.520]  insane with people hanging themselves because their phones get taken away with laser weaponry
[1:26:38.520 --> 1:26:43.720]  is being invented with hillary clinton servers next to a dumpster in a bathroom as things get
[1:26:43.720 --> 1:26:49.720]  more and more unbelievable it becomes believable that maybe the establishment isn't on our side
[1:26:49.720 --> 1:26:54.120]  and maybe there is something wrong with this system so as it gets worse it does get better
[1:26:54.120 --> 1:26:59.640]  so your tagline of positive change coming out of the tyranny i would agree 100 the positive
[1:26:59.640 --> 1:27:03.880]  change is coming out of the tyranny because they're showing their hand and people aren't buying it
[1:27:03.880 --> 1:27:09.240]  anymore and you know people seem to be walking around in a fog they know something's not quite
[1:27:09.240 --> 1:27:13.960]  right there's a huge thirst for alternative information that's why we've been successful
[1:27:13.960 --> 1:27:19.400]  and that's why we need to fill that gap so yes i've noticed since you know in comparison to 10-15
[1:27:19.400 --> 1:27:25.240]  years ago people do resonate more with alternative perspectives on a number of different issues so
[1:27:25.240 --> 1:27:30.840]  we need to remain positive simply in our mannerisms in approaching people to talk about these different
[1:27:30.840 --> 1:27:35.000]  subjects because you know if you approach people and you're all apologetic about what you're about
[1:27:35.000 --> 1:27:39.400]  to talk about you don't have confidence yeah then instantly they turn off because the establishment
[1:27:39.400 --> 1:27:44.040]  heads have confidence yeah that's the other thing too all the media the media at least they have
[1:27:44.040 --> 1:27:48.840]  confidence even though they're deceptive creatures you know at least they have confidence they'll
[1:27:48.840 --> 1:27:53.160]  sit up here and tell you something right that's why people like trump he has confidence but at
[1:27:53.160 --> 1:27:56.920]  the same time if you go up to someone and you also berate them they're not going to listen to you if
[1:27:56.920 --> 1:28:00.920]  you say you idiot you don't know about that you stupid idiot you can't talk to people like that
[1:28:00.920 --> 1:28:05.880]  you know you have to help them and want to help them ivan in texas you're on the egg go ahead ivan
[1:28:08.200 --> 1:28:11.960]  you know i want to kind of start off by saying you know honestly today society unfortunately has
[1:28:11.960 --> 1:28:17.560]  just trained us to the point of saying that cell phones are okay in so many different ways because
[1:28:17.560 --> 1:28:21.720]  we communicate in so many different ways we get all our information in so many different ways
[1:28:21.720 --> 1:28:26.040]  you know and we have so many different barriers to break down i mean and all of it starts with bullying
[1:28:26.040 --> 1:28:29.960]  if you really think about it the government's been bullying us for all our lives by feeding us
[1:28:29.960 --> 1:28:35.000]  information that's just you know come on let's get let's get real pretty wack you know to say that
[1:28:35.000 --> 1:28:41.960]  it's actually even accurate we know the facts i'm pretty sure we know the facts now not only that
[1:28:41.960 --> 1:28:46.760]  i mean look out to the extent what people have taken it to to say that you know they're having to
[1:28:46.760 --> 1:28:51.000]  be worried about their lives and i know this is happening daily because i have friends that have
[1:28:51.000 --> 1:28:56.040]  to deal with it daily i know to say that they're so bullied and so weak that they don't even have
[1:28:56.040 --> 1:29:00.760]  the strength they say that they can have a cell phone in public that's always being hidden and
[1:29:00.760 --> 1:29:06.120]  just trying to say that oh it's okay we've been bullied down by the government so bad that it's
[1:29:06.120 --> 1:29:12.120]  time we have to get all our facts together to say we stand up well i think it's it's fine
[1:29:12.120 --> 1:29:16.040]  we were talking earlier about you know how rude it is to use your cell phone in public situations
[1:29:16.040 --> 1:29:20.760]  it's fine if you're sharing information like you say hey look at this article look at this youtube video
[1:29:20.760 --> 1:29:26.280]  i think that's perfectly acceptable to do that so we need to use it at the right moment we don't
[1:29:26.280 --> 1:29:31.080]  need to use it to ignore our families ignore our friends of being locked in our own world
[1:29:31.080 --> 1:29:36.440]  but it can be used for positive effects presidential debate coming up tonight

[1:33:36.520 --> 1:33:42.520]  joined by my guest gad sad who is an evolutionary behavioral scientist at the john molson school
[1:33:42.520 --> 1:33:48.840]  of business concordia university in montreal canada now some of the subjects he's been focusing on
[1:33:48.840 --> 1:33:55.720]  recently have kind of intersected with my interests he tweeted out one of my videos about feminism
[1:33:56.280 --> 1:34:00.360]  so we're going to talk about radical feminism we're going to talk about social justice warriors
[1:34:01.080 --> 1:34:07.240]  and the progressives who have abandoned truly liberal principles we're going to cover a raft
[1:34:07.240 --> 1:34:15.400]  of issues today and it's gad sad gad s a ad youtube.com slash gad sad gad welcome to the show
[1:34:15.400 --> 1:34:21.880]  okay good to be with you paul so let's just start off by explaining some of your background
[1:34:21.880 --> 1:34:26.040]  and how it led you to becoming involved in some of the issues that we're going to cover today
[1:34:26.600 --> 1:34:30.600]  so going back to sort of my my childhood background my ethnic background you made or
[1:34:30.600 --> 1:34:37.080]  my academic background your academic background so i study basically how to apply evolutionary
[1:34:37.080 --> 1:34:43.800]  psychology in the context of consumer behavior so i look at the biological underpinnings
[1:34:43.800 --> 1:34:48.760]  that make us consume the way that we consume and an inherent part of being an evolutionary
[1:34:48.760 --> 1:34:54.680]  psychologist is to recognize that there are innate realities some of these innate realities
[1:34:54.680 --> 1:34:59.960]  manifest themselves in sex differences so there are many things that men and women are
[1:34:59.960 --> 1:35:04.760]  similar on and then there are other things that we should expect a difference if we look at the
[1:35:04.760 --> 1:35:11.960]  evolutionary challenges that each sex has had to face and so in that context i have had a chance
[1:35:11.960 --> 1:35:18.920]  to interact with a lot of you know feminists and social constructivists and postmodernists
[1:35:18.920 --> 1:35:24.600]  a wide range of social scientists and humanities folks who reject the some of the ideas of
[1:35:24.600 --> 1:35:30.680]  evolutionary psychology precisely because it goes frontally against some of their most cherished
[1:35:30.680 --> 1:35:37.400]  beliefs and so that's how if you like academically i am vested in this in this debate
[1:35:37.400 --> 1:35:43.720]  so you've committed the thought crime basically of asserting the fact that there are differences
[1:35:43.720 --> 1:35:49.160]  between men and women you've been attacked for that by feminists by social justice warriors
[1:35:49.160 --> 1:35:53.080]  because now we've got an environment of political correctness we've got
[1:35:53.080 --> 1:35:58.520]  this uh sensorious environment where if you dare speak out if you dare challenge the consensus
[1:35:58.520 --> 1:36:04.760]  on any of these issues there's a whole machine of public shaming of social media shaming that
[1:36:04.760 --> 1:36:10.200]  will attack you based on these you know politically correct narratives that they have to defend
[1:36:10.760 --> 1:36:14.600]  because if they're exposed then it will bring down their entire narrative so let's get into
[1:36:14.600 --> 1:36:19.880]  political correctness sure which of course it's you know it's it's reached insane levels we had
[1:36:19.880 --> 1:36:25.160]  the University of New Hampshire a couple of months ago saying you can't use the word American
[1:36:25.160 --> 1:36:30.680]  because it might offend people from South America you know they're saying the use of the word
[1:36:30.680 --> 1:36:35.960]  mothering or fathering could offend somebody we've got trigger warnings at universities
[1:36:35.960 --> 1:36:42.760]  just break down you know the origins of political correctness and the true agenda behind it today
[1:36:43.400 --> 1:36:49.720]  well i think that the sort of the title of your website info wars speaks exactly to this issue
[1:36:49.720 --> 1:36:56.920]  right i mean if you wish to win the cultural wars if you wish to win the battle of ideas
[1:36:56.920 --> 1:37:03.560]  you could either engage people on equal footing right where you each evaluate the merits of the
[1:37:04.280 --> 1:37:11.080]  opponent and then hopefully the best idea wins or if you don't feel comfortable and so doing
[1:37:11.080 --> 1:37:15.640]  maybe perhaps because you might end up losing the battle of ideas then you come up with all
[1:37:15.640 --> 1:37:21.640]  sorts of mechanisms to shut down debate right so if i am a authoritarian dictator somewhere
[1:37:21.640 --> 1:37:25.880]  i could shut down debate by making it illegal i mean i could kill you if you say something
[1:37:25.880 --> 1:37:32.760]  that is contrary to the official doctrine in the context of the west you can't quite behead people
[1:37:32.760 --> 1:37:36.600]  but what you can do is you could behead their reputation you could behead
[1:37:38.440 --> 1:37:42.040]  all sorts of things that are important to them and that's exactly what happens with political
[1:37:42.040 --> 1:37:49.080]  correctness it is a means by which people are so afraid to openly speak about positions that they
[1:37:49.080 --> 1:37:54.520]  hold uh chair's positions that they hold that they will self-censor and hence their voices
[1:37:54.520 --> 1:38:00.120]  have been beheaded so to speak and that's the key really isn't it i mean that's why i see you know
[1:38:00.120 --> 1:38:05.080]  the main force of censorship not coming from the state anymore it's coming from within the culture
[1:38:05.080 --> 1:38:10.280]  because if you create this standard by which people are terrified to even open their mouths in the
[1:38:10.280 --> 1:38:15.720]  first place for fear of what might happen for fear of what their peers might say you don't even really
[1:38:15.720 --> 1:38:21.240]  need the hard core censorship to come in after that because people won't even utter these kind of
[1:38:21.240 --> 1:38:25.640]  statements in the first place and that's yet that's the essence of political correctness right it's
[1:38:25.640 --> 1:38:32.120]  about restricting thought because as you said these progressives these social justice warriors
[1:38:32.120 --> 1:38:39.160]  don't believe in equality they don't believe in the logic of one argument winning over another
[1:38:39.160 --> 1:38:45.000]  on a level playing field correct absolutely and and you know what is even more disheartening is that
[1:38:45.000 --> 1:38:50.440]  this this cancer of political correctness is not something that sort of afflicts uh the average
[1:38:50.440 --> 1:38:56.360]  joe walking in the street it actually afflicts the people who should be leading the discourse so
[1:38:56.360 --> 1:39:01.480]  think about all the intelligentsia think about the people the professors in the ivory tower right
[1:39:01.480 --> 1:39:06.760]  they are the ones who should be leading this exchange and and oftentimes i hate to say it uh
[1:39:06.760 --> 1:39:12.360]  they are some of the most cowardly folks they are some of the folks who are most infected with the
[1:39:12.360 --> 1:39:19.480]  cancer of political correctness precisely because they belong to a club let's call it the historically
[1:39:19.480 --> 1:39:24.200]  let's call the progressive club but now many people are using the term which i love the regressive
[1:39:24.200 --> 1:39:29.480]  left uh and so they don't want to ever be ostracized from that group so even though
[1:39:29.480 --> 1:39:34.920]  they might privately write to me or privately when we're having an espresso say you know what i
[1:39:34.920 --> 1:39:39.480]  frankly support a lot of the things that you say openly but i don't feel comfortable saying it in
[1:39:39.480 --> 1:39:46.120]  public uh they won't like something that i put up on facebook because even liking it might somehow
[1:39:46.120 --> 1:39:51.800]  get them feathered and tarred so it's really orwellian i mean it is scary that people are so
[1:39:51.800 --> 1:39:57.800]  insecure about their cherished beliefs that they engage in this type of self-censorship
[1:39:59.080 --> 1:40:04.520]  and as he said you know a lot of professors are afraid to make what they fear maybe politically
[1:40:04.520 --> 1:40:09.880]  incorrect statements because whereas once they they embraced classical liberalism you know they were
[1:40:09.880 --> 1:40:16.120]  tolerant of debate they were tolerant of a free exchange of ideas now they've been influenced
[1:40:16.120 --> 1:40:22.200]  to such an extent by the people who are completely intolerant that they kowtow they self sense their
[1:40:22.200 --> 1:40:28.040]  beliefs to appease those people there was an interesting interview with Stella Murabito
[1:40:28.760 --> 1:40:32.840]  she gave an interview to The Daily Caller a couple of days ago and this is basically a former
[1:40:32.840 --> 1:40:37.800]  intelligence analyst who describes herself as a left winger but she made the point that
[1:40:37.800 --> 1:40:43.480]  that politically correct thought control and you know the elite narratives that are reinforced through
[1:40:43.480 --> 1:40:50.920]  it they do it as you just you know touched upon then via social isolation and peer pressure it's
[1:40:50.920 --> 1:40:57.960]  the threat of what other people god forbid might think if you dare express an independent opinion
[1:40:57.960 --> 1:41:03.240]  something mildly controversial which ties into an interesting video that you did which i saw
[1:41:03.240 --> 1:41:09.160]  a couple of days ago about the Solomon ash conformity experiment which we briefly touched upon
[1:41:09.160 --> 1:41:15.240]  earlier in the show so tell us about this study and what it tells us about how strong a force the
[1:41:15.240 --> 1:41:22.920]  desire to conform really is right so whenever i teach you know my you know consumer psychology
[1:41:22.920 --> 1:41:28.120]  or psychology of decision making i often will begin by lecturing about some of my favorite
[1:41:28.120 --> 1:41:32.520]  psychology experiments of all time and usually what they have in common is that they are very
[1:41:32.520 --> 1:41:37.640]  very simple experiments that demonstrate something that is extraordinarily powerful about human nature
[1:41:37.640 --> 1:41:43.160]  and so in the case of Solomon ash this was a social psychologist who in the 50s decided to test
[1:41:44.200 --> 1:41:52.200]  people's proclivity to conform and here to conform to stimuli that are otherwise not very ambiguous
[1:41:52.200 --> 1:41:56.600]  right so we're not talking about the real world where everything is gray where it is unclear what
[1:41:56.600 --> 1:42:00.920]  is the right action to take so here's what he basically did he brought in a bunch of people
[1:42:00.920 --> 1:42:06.840]  and he had one line and then next to it three other lines one of those three other lines was
[1:42:06.840 --> 1:42:12.280]  the same length as the yeah great i'm glad you're showing it so it's clear to anybody who's got you
[1:42:12.280 --> 1:42:18.680]  know normal vision which of the three lines a b c should be the one that is the same as the line on
[1:42:18.680 --> 1:42:23.960]  the left and so what he would do is he he'd bring in people and then he'd have a bunch of confederates
[1:42:23.960 --> 1:42:28.120]  meaning these are fake subjects who are not really subject are they pretending to be subject
[1:42:28.120 --> 1:42:32.680]  but there's really only one true subject and so he would ask each of those people please tell us
[1:42:32.680 --> 1:42:38.120]  which of the three lines a and b and c are the same as as the line on the left and each of the
[1:42:38.120 --> 1:42:44.120]  confederates i mean depending on the condition that of the experiment would utter out you know in
[1:42:44.120 --> 1:42:50.520]  public openly uh the wrong answer and so what he was doing there is he's setting up the conditions
[1:42:50.520 --> 1:42:57.080]  to see whether the actual participant who would be the last guy in line whether he would say well
[1:42:57.080 --> 1:43:02.520]  what are you talking about no sorry guys that's the wrong line you're wrong or whether he would conform
[1:43:02.520 --> 1:43:08.920]  and the reality is that a non-trivial number of people i mean different conditions resulted in
[1:43:08.920 --> 1:43:14.680]  different compliance rates but certainly quite a substantial number of people would go against
[1:43:14.680 --> 1:43:20.040]  their eyes and simply conform to group pressures now again what makes this study so powerful
[1:43:20.040 --> 1:43:26.440]  is that this is not an ambiguous stimulus it should be clear to any sane person who is who has
[1:43:26.440 --> 1:43:32.040]  you know reasonable vision what the true answer is but yet my desire to conform to the group is
[1:43:32.040 --> 1:43:38.920]  greater than my lying eyes so there you go and you know as he mentioned in in some cases it was
[1:43:38.920 --> 1:43:45.960]  literally 38 39 percent of people who said what was clearly the wrong answer you can see from the
[1:43:45.960 --> 1:43:51.000]  example that we just showed on screen it's obvious which line is the same length as the line on the
[1:43:51.000 --> 1:43:55.720]  left but because seven other people before them had given a different answer and these were
[1:43:55.720 --> 1:44:01.320]  stooges in this experiment they chose the same answer simply to conform to the peer pressure
[1:44:01.880 --> 1:44:08.200]  obviously knowing that it was the wrong answer and we also see this conformity in fashion correct
[1:44:08.200 --> 1:44:14.280]  because we follow the herd again i was buying i was trying to buy jeans a few weeks ago i was on a
[1:44:14.280 --> 1:44:20.520]  website a clothing website now we know that you know a lot of fashion designers are homosexuals
[1:44:20.520 --> 1:44:26.200]  they're gay men fair enough as long as the clothes look good i don't care but literally every single
[1:44:26.200 --> 1:44:33.400]  pair of jeans was rolled up with no socks so i was like i don't wear jeans without socks i don't
[1:44:33.400 --> 1:44:39.000]  wear jeans that are rolled up so i can't see what they look like with shoes on literally every pair
[1:44:39.000 --> 1:44:44.840]  of jeans on the website was like this because that's the fashion and if you don't conform to that
[1:44:44.840 --> 1:44:48.760]  then you know you're going to have problems you're going to get socially isolated in some
[1:44:48.760 --> 1:44:55.800]  circumstances so this conformity also applies to fashion correct yeah that's a perfect point
[1:44:55.800 --> 1:45:01.480]  because i i actually use this exact example in my books where i argue that fashion is nothing
[1:45:01.480 --> 1:45:05.640]  but a big conformity experiment either you've independently thought of this or you've been
[1:45:05.640 --> 1:45:11.800]  reading my books because that's exactly what it is right you you create a queue of in french we say
[1:45:11.800 --> 1:45:19.000]  apocalypse or belongingness right today to be part of the fact the in fashion group you have to wear
[1:45:19.000 --> 1:45:25.240]  brown that's it there's some dictum that says that brown is in well we all rush and buy brown well
[1:45:25.240 --> 1:45:31.400]  next season brown is the evil color it's now green while we all drop our evil brown and we rush to
[1:45:31.400 --> 1:45:38.760]  buy green so it is exactly catering to some innate need to belong which in this case manifests itself
[1:45:38.760 --> 1:45:43.960]  in the fashion industry i'll tell you a very quick story a few years ago the fashion was at least
[1:45:43.960 --> 1:45:49.880]  amongst uh you know young women of university age to wear ugg boots are you familiar with ugg boots
[1:45:49.880 --> 1:45:55.800]  yeah sure yeah right well i mean i i would not be engaging in hyperbole if i were to tell you
[1:45:55.800 --> 1:46:03.480]  that probably 50 percent of the female students in my at least undergraduate classes were wearing
[1:46:03.480 --> 1:46:10.360]  ugg boots so much so that you would almost think that my university had that as part of its dress
[1:46:10.360 --> 1:46:16.440]  code like you had to wear ugg boots otherwise somehow you wouldn't be allowed entrance into
[1:46:16.440 --> 1:46:21.800]  the school and of course now i don't see them wearing ugg boots so this this need to conform
[1:46:21.800 --> 1:46:27.560]  manifests itself in an endless ways and regrettably in the context of political correctness it manifests
[1:46:27.560 --> 1:46:34.440]  itself in these insidious ways we're talking to gad sad his youtube channel is youtube.com forward
[1:46:34.440 --> 1:46:42.520]  slash gad sad twitter at gad sad go and check out some of his videos excellent content let's go to
[1:46:42.520 --> 1:46:48.040]  feminism now because of course you shared one or two of my videos on feminism and you touched upon
[1:46:48.040 --> 1:46:53.640]  it on the intro there you know modern feminists are loath to acknowledge the fact that there are
[1:46:53.640 --> 1:46:58.920]  these fundamental differences between men and women it's not enough to say that men and women are
[1:46:58.920 --> 1:47:06.120]  better suited to different tasks but still equal that's not good enough so from your background
[1:47:06.120 --> 1:47:12.840]  in evolutionary psychology why is there this drive to homogenize the sexes and why is it so
[1:47:12.840 --> 1:47:19.560]  fundamentally unscientific well i think it starts if i'm going to be charitable towards them i would
[1:47:19.560 --> 1:47:26.920]  say the following it starts from a the laudable goal of trying to eradicate institutionalized
[1:47:26.920 --> 1:47:32.920]  sexism now we can all agree that if feminism is about making sure that men and women are equal
[1:47:32.920 --> 1:47:38.360]  in all of the various ways politically economically socially then of course we can all buy into that
[1:47:38.920 --> 1:47:45.400]  grand objective now here's what's where they make the mistake they think that in the pursuit of
[1:47:45.400 --> 1:47:52.600]  equality it is easier to have a narrative that says that the two sexes are fundamentally
[1:47:52.600 --> 1:47:59.960]  indistinguishable from one another because that simply doesn't allow any sexism to seep into the
[1:47:59.960 --> 1:48:06.680]  narrative if you concede that men and women are very similar in some ways and very different in
[1:48:06.680 --> 1:48:14.040]  others this lends a weaponry if you'd like for sexism to be maintained and so they start off with
[1:48:14.040 --> 1:48:19.640]  a laudable premise and they of course wrongly think that by arguing that the two sexes are
[1:48:19.640 --> 1:48:24.760]  biologically distinguishable this means that sexism will always exist which is of course
[1:48:24.760 --> 1:48:31.240]  nonsense so it so if i'm going to be charitable i would say that that's where their fundamental
[1:48:31.240 --> 1:48:37.960]  original error stems from and this this idea that there are no differences or that there are minimal
[1:48:37.960 --> 1:48:45.160]  differences it doesn't conform to reality which is that we live in a meritocracy if you if your
[1:48:45.160 --> 1:48:49.720]  skills are higher than somebody else's if you're better at a certain task you should be given the
[1:48:49.720 --> 1:48:55.400]  opportunity over them that's not what they want they want the oppression olympics where you know
[1:48:55.400 --> 1:49:01.800]  gender or race or whatever issue is held to a higher standard than actual skill and talent
[1:49:01.800 --> 1:49:07.080]  which of course is is disastrous for a society that's trying to develop and improve because you
[1:49:07.080 --> 1:49:11.960]  want the cream to rise to the top you want the best people in the best positions correct
[1:49:12.680 --> 1:49:18.520]  yes and i would say that that particular mindset actually comes from the tabula rasa
[1:49:20.120 --> 1:49:23.960]  premise of the human mind right the idea that we are all born with empty minds
[1:49:23.960 --> 1:49:30.040]  without any biological innate imperatives and that what makes us who we become is strictly our
[1:49:30.040 --> 1:49:38.360]  environment strictly socialization strictly culture and so to recognize that there are starting
[1:49:38.360 --> 1:49:43.880]  points that there are biological imperatives that make men and women on some issues fundamentally
[1:49:43.880 --> 1:49:49.240]  different from one another violates this tabula rasa premise right i mean it could be taken to
[1:49:49.240 --> 1:49:56.920]  such ludicrous heights that the idea for example that leonel messi might have a innate talent that
[1:49:56.920 --> 1:50:02.680]  he started off with in other words leonel messi it didn't matter what environment he had would always
[1:50:02.680 --> 1:50:09.400]  end up being a greater soccer player than paul joseph watson they would reject that they would
[1:50:09.400 --> 1:50:16.600]  say that there is a unique confluence of environmental factors that created leonel messi
[1:50:16.600 --> 1:50:22.760]  but there is nothing inherent in his starting point that would have made leonel messi any
[1:50:22.760 --> 1:50:29.160]  better than paul joseph watson and so again it comes from the idea that we are we all have
[1:50:29.160 --> 1:50:35.800]  equal potentiality we all could be anything and that's simply not true we'll be back with
[1:50:35.800 --> 1:50:41.400]  gad sad after the break we're going to talk about social media and mob outrage along with the wrath

[1:55:06.200 --> 1:55:12.280]  is youtube.com forward slash gad sad be sure to check out his excellent videos which i discovered
[1:55:12.280 --> 1:55:18.920]  just recently feminism we touched upon it before the break in terms of you know how it's fundamentally
[1:55:18.920 --> 1:55:24.600]  unscientific to not recognize the basic differences between men and women which is what radical
[1:55:24.600 --> 1:55:30.760]  feminism intends to do because it's all about a power grab it's not about true equality they
[1:55:30.760 --> 1:55:36.360]  don't recognize true equality they only want to exploit this to create division so they can come
[1:55:36.360 --> 1:55:42.600]  in and fill the vacuum and basically play you know the the oppression olympics where one gender is
[1:55:42.600 --> 1:55:48.760]  raised above another and society isn't based on meritocracy which it should be to create and
[1:55:48.760 --> 1:55:55.560]  build a successful society with both men and women contributing in terms of what they're good at
[1:55:56.120 --> 1:56:02.840]  but let's move on to you know just the the word itself the modern incarnation of feminism and
[1:56:02.840 --> 1:56:08.840]  i've made numerous videos about this has become so unpopular that it's basically turned feminism
[1:56:08.840 --> 1:56:15.640]  into a dirty word we've got polls now with less than 25 percent of american women identifying
[1:56:15.640 --> 1:56:21.560]  as feminists and i think even the more recent polls show that it's less than that so gad sad
[1:56:22.280 --> 1:56:28.440]  why does the establishment media again mainly through the entertainment industry still insist
[1:56:28.440 --> 1:56:35.960]  on promoting and venerating what is obviously a discredited and in many ways harmful belief system
[1:56:35.960 --> 1:56:42.520]  why do they insist insist on pushing this radical feminism bent when less and less people are
[1:56:42.520 --> 1:56:49.480]  resonating with it i'm guessing because they in a sense exist within their echo chamber where they
[1:56:49.480 --> 1:56:55.720]  don't necessarily receive feedback uh that the message is not resonating right because the people
[1:56:55.720 --> 1:57:01.160]  that they get together with to sip their fancy lattes are in full agreement with their positions
[1:57:01.160 --> 1:57:07.880]  this is kind of like when a professor overestimates his ability in terms of how well he'll do in his
[1:57:07.880 --> 1:57:13.560]  teaching at the end of the semester why does he he or she overestimated is because he's only receiving
[1:57:13.560 --> 1:57:19.000]  feedback from students who come up to him to say hey professor loved your loved your term right
[1:57:19.000 --> 1:57:23.720]  but the people who thought that he was really poor didn't take the time to come up to him and say
[1:57:23.720 --> 1:57:27.960]  hey professor i really thought you sucked and doubt this was the worst cost and therefore he
[1:57:27.960 --> 1:57:33.880]  walks into the teaching evaluation thinking that he is actually going to perform better than he truly
[1:57:33.880 --> 1:57:38.360]  will perform and the same thing is happening with traditional media right they're they're not
[1:57:38.360 --> 1:57:45.320]  necessarily uh in touch with the general landscape and the mood of the general populace and and i
[1:57:45.320 --> 1:57:51.240]  think whether it be your media outlet or other independent media outlets i think they are correcting
[1:57:51.240 --> 1:57:57.160]  for that problem because they're offering voices uh to folks who otherwise would have never gotten
[1:57:57.160 --> 1:58:02.520]  a foot in the door uh if it were the traditional media that were still uh you know monopolizing
[1:58:02.520 --> 1:58:08.120]  all the voices so thank you for your show and for other people like you why appreciate it and
[1:58:08.120 --> 1:58:13.480]  that's exactly what it is it's an echo chamber and feminists themselves they refuse to be challenged
[1:58:13.480 --> 1:58:18.280]  that's why they never you know temper or adjust these radical belief systems they've got these
[1:58:18.280 --> 1:58:23.960]  these block lists on twitter they refuse to even engage in any kind of conversation any debate
[1:58:23.960 --> 1:58:28.840]  you know you've got trigger warnings safe spaces they hate free speech they hate debate we're going

[2:00:33.080 --> 2:00:37.560]  we're going to go to your calls after our guest gets off here at the bottom of the hour but we're
[2:00:37.560 --> 2:00:44.520]  talking to gad sad who is a behavioral scientist about feminism about social justice warriors
[2:00:44.520 --> 2:00:51.480]  about the threat to free speech and now i want to switch to social media and mob outrage which
[2:00:51.480 --> 2:00:58.040]  of course is becoming an increasingly potent force social media outrage basically people
[2:00:58.040 --> 2:01:04.360]  being publicly shamed fired from their jobs we saw it a few weeks ago with the lawyer who
[2:01:04.360 --> 2:01:10.760]  had the temerity to call a female's you know linkedin picture stunning god forbid he was fired he
[2:01:10.760 --> 2:01:17.800]  was publicly shamed and again in some cases people being physically hounded for their politically
[2:01:17.800 --> 2:01:23.000]  incorrect free speech but there's something of a backlash brewing against this phenomenon
[2:01:23.960 --> 2:01:28.440]  and gad sad would you agree that you know as i mentioned earlier the biggest threat to free
[2:01:28.440 --> 2:01:34.840]  speech is now not necessarily the state it's these hate mobs on twitter on facebook who have
[2:01:34.840 --> 2:01:42.200]  basically acute accumulated this power simply from being perpetually offended they amplify each
[2:01:42.200 --> 2:01:47.800]  other's offense even though it's completely baseless in most cases now they've accumulated
[2:01:47.800 --> 2:01:54.600]  this power of public shaming which in many cases is more power is more powerful than the state when
[2:01:54.600 --> 2:02:01.800]  they try to crush free speech via direct censorship absolutely look let me give you a few personal
[2:02:01.800 --> 2:02:09.400]  anecdotes i often ask some of my colleagues who should be at the forefront of engaging the public
[2:02:09.400 --> 2:02:15.400]  right i mean as as academics and as scientists i mean yes sure we could work within our areas of
[2:02:15.400 --> 2:02:20.360]  expertise but some of us have you know opinions to share about all sorts of issues we should
[2:02:20.360 --> 2:02:25.800]  uh be drawing a bridge to the public at large yet many of them will get back to me and say
[2:02:25.800 --> 2:02:31.240]  gee you know i i i sometimes look at your uh public platform and i and i wish i could do
[2:02:31.240 --> 2:02:36.440]  what you could do i said well why don't you and oftentimes not always but oftentimes the answer
[2:02:36.440 --> 2:02:42.680]  that i get back is frankly i'm afraid i'm afraid because of some of the dynamics that you mentioned
[2:02:42.680 --> 2:02:49.720]  at the start of your question right i mean i don't want to expose myself to uh these ravenous mobs
[2:02:49.720 --> 2:02:55.320]  i don't want to perhaps say something once that might be misconstrued i'll give you an example
[2:02:55.960 --> 2:03:03.640]  a colleague of mine once tweeted uh he was trying to make a quip okay maybe it was a
[2:03:03.640 --> 2:03:08.600]  a silly one but he said something to the effect and i'm gonna paraphrase you know overweight people
[2:03:08.600 --> 2:03:15.400]  if you don't have the willpower to resist the next pasta dish then uh you know maybe you won't have
[2:03:15.400 --> 2:03:21.880]  the ability to finish your dissertations it's obnoxious it's annoying it's probably ill advised
[2:03:21.880 --> 2:03:28.120]  but he was trying to be witty and it backfired now it backfired so powerfully and this is a
[2:03:28.120 --> 2:03:35.640]  a very very respected lovely gentle uh guy uh it's so backfired that people were calling for
[2:03:35.640 --> 2:03:41.240]  him to lose his tenured position now this is a guy who's lived his life very honorably he's a very
[2:03:41.240 --> 2:03:48.520]  very well respected scientist i know him personally i know his character you know he he he tried his
[2:03:48.520 --> 2:03:55.400]  luck at a joke that was probably idiotic and it failed now to imagine that people could be so
[2:03:55.400 --> 2:04:03.160]  diabolically nasty that that mistake that he made should end his career and that they would call
[2:04:03.160 --> 2:04:09.720]  for that it's simply breathtaking and so in most cases people don't want to join the discussion
[2:04:09.720 --> 2:04:13.800]  because they're afraid of repercussions and hence we have self self-censorship again
[2:04:15.320 --> 2:04:19.400]  and again you mentioned the fat-shaming angle there i've made videos about that
[2:04:19.400 --> 2:04:24.520]  there was actually a tv show recently like a sitcom and one of the skits which was like a
[2:04:24.520 --> 2:04:31.000]  promotional thing for the 30-minute tv show was basically a fat guy very fat guy obi sat in a
[2:04:31.000 --> 2:04:35.320]  doctor's office saying you know doctor what's wrong with me and the doctor says well you're fat
[2:04:35.320 --> 2:04:39.880]  that's what's wrong with you they called for the show to be banned yeah that's that's the level it's
[2:04:39.880 --> 2:04:43.720]  got to where humor and jerry seinfeld a bunch of other people have complained about this where
[2:04:43.720 --> 2:04:49.240]  humor is now you know not to be tolerated whatsoever we're gonna come back with gad sad after the
[2:04:49.240 --> 2:04:55.240]  break we can talk about social media and mob outrage this is the alex joneshow live info wars

[2:08:21.640 --> 2:08:38.360]  it's paul joseph watson back live with the alex jones show we've got gad sad on the line for
[2:08:38.360 --> 2:08:45.880]  another 20 25 minutes or so top story on info wars.com this is also linked on the drudger report
[2:08:45.880 --> 2:08:53.000]  obama american suspicion of government is paralyzing in a somewhat under the radar interview
[2:08:53.000 --> 2:08:58.200]  the president made some candid comments that reveal more than usual regarding his end of
[2:08:58.200 --> 2:09:04.680]  office agenda noting that he finds americans common skepticism of government paralyzing
[2:09:05.400 --> 2:09:11.080]  which is interesting given our topic of conversation political correctness which of
[2:09:11.080 --> 2:09:16.840]  course was started by the frankfort school that's how it was imported into america it was embraced
[2:09:16.840 --> 2:09:24.600]  by the soviets it was embraced by mawis china who of course defined a politically incorrect opinion
[2:09:24.600 --> 2:09:30.440]  as one that disagreed with the state again illustrating the fact that this is a top
[2:09:30.440 --> 2:09:37.080]  down tool of censorship and oppression this isn't a grassroots bottom-up movement for people to be
[2:09:37.080 --> 2:09:42.520]  kinder to each other it's nothing to do with that this is a threat to free speech it's a threat to
[2:09:42.520 --> 2:09:48.040]  open debate it's infected our universities and it needs to be addressed and there is a backlash
[2:09:48.040 --> 2:09:54.120]  against it in fact if you read john ronson's book so you've been publicly shamed he kind of
[2:09:54.120 --> 2:09:59.800]  underscores the point that you don't apologize to these people that's the only way you win that's
[2:09:59.800 --> 2:10:04.680]  the only way you come out on top it's the only way you don't get fired from your job publicly
[2:10:04.680 --> 2:10:11.480]  shamed by not apologizing by not backing down because these outrage mobs are paper tigers when
[2:10:11.480 --> 2:10:17.800]  you actually challenge them and stand up to them they disappear they completely evaporate but we're
[2:10:17.800 --> 2:10:24.600]  talking to gad sad about this and it's youtube.com slash gad sad or he's on twitter at gad sad again
[2:10:24.600 --> 2:10:32.840]  g ad s a ad he can find out more of his content there but again social media a lot of this social
[2:10:32.840 --> 2:10:39.880]  justice warrior mob outrage is driven by what's become to be known as virtue signaling and that
[2:10:39.880 --> 2:10:46.680]  means basically hashtag activism and people espousing politically correct beliefs simply to
[2:10:46.680 --> 2:10:53.000]  make themselves look good simply to earn social brownie points with the rest of their progressive
[2:10:53.000 --> 2:10:58.520]  friends whether they even believe in those opinions or not or whether they're just being lazy you know
[2:10:58.520 --> 2:11:04.680]  for example sharing the kony 2012 video before even watching it or knowing what it was about
[2:11:05.320 --> 2:11:12.360]  so gad sad from a behavioral and psychological perspective why is virtue signaling such a
[2:11:12.360 --> 2:11:19.240]  compelling temptation for people to engage in why has it become so pervasive well so it's a
[2:11:19.240 --> 2:11:23.960]  great question because i actually discussed this in several of my books so that's before i address
[2:11:23.960 --> 2:11:29.000]  that specific question let's talk about for example conspicuous consumption by the idea for example
[2:11:29.000 --> 2:11:35.160]  that you know why is it that 99 percent of ferrari owners tend to be men well it's because it's a
[2:11:35.160 --> 2:11:40.440]  form of peacocking right in the same way that the peacock uses his tail to send certain signals about
[2:11:40.440 --> 2:11:46.040]  his phenotypic quality right how good his genes are because they are honest signals of his fitness
[2:11:46.040 --> 2:11:51.720]  humans engage in all sorts of signaling men and women but contrary to what feminists tell us
[2:11:51.720 --> 2:11:58.440]  men and women use different sex specific signals to typically impress one another well in the case
[2:11:58.440 --> 2:12:04.600]  of virtue signaling i am signaling not necessarily my wealth or my beauty but i'm signaling certain
[2:12:04.600 --> 2:12:11.800]  attributes that i think that my social network is going to find desirable and so in the case of
[2:12:11.800 --> 2:12:17.160]  hashtag uh activism i'm basically demonstrating that i care about the world that i care about
[2:12:17.160 --> 2:12:22.200]  something beyond myself i'm not narcissistic but of course it's hypocritical because the same people
[2:12:22.200 --> 2:12:28.680]  who do the hashtag stuff won't take on the really serious issues they don't really speak about
[2:12:28.680 --> 2:12:35.640]  female genital mutilation or throwing acid on women's faces or child brides or honor killings
[2:12:35.640 --> 2:12:40.280]  that would be scary you see because they could be repercussions from the people that you're
[2:12:40.280 --> 2:12:47.160]  criticizing but to go after the poor and name somewhat castrated sorry to say it this way
[2:12:47.720 --> 2:12:53.640]  shirtgate guy uh because he wore a shirt that seemed to have some offensive images on them
[2:12:53.640 --> 2:12:59.480]  even though those images were drawn by a woman well that's that actually can still show that i
[2:12:59.480 --> 2:13:05.160]  am engaged socially that i could be outraged by the patriarchy and there won't be any backlash
[2:13:05.160 --> 2:13:13.400]  against me so i could show that i am serious and engage and not lose the not risk the fact of
[2:13:13.400 --> 2:13:20.040]  losing my head perfect let's do some virtue signaling and i had an experience with this
[2:13:20.040 --> 2:13:26.040]  you know in my personal life my girlfriend's dad is basically you know a guardian reader a progressive
[2:13:26.040 --> 2:13:31.240]  a left-wing or a liberal with this whole migrant crisis this has given people the opportunity to
[2:13:31.240 --> 2:13:37.960]  virtue signal to an unbelievable level basically they've got a five bedroom house and you know given
[2:13:37.960 --> 2:13:44.040]  london housing standards it's not a big house it's the bedrooms are tiny he actually wanted to take
[2:13:44.040 --> 2:13:50.840]  in two immigrant families to live in these two office bedrooms which were basically you know
[2:13:51.560 --> 2:13:56.280]  tiny they couldn't have housed a family they could barely house one person in there so again
[2:13:56.280 --> 2:14:03.000]  merely making this this observation this advocacy for virtue signaling with no intention whatsoever
[2:14:03.000 --> 2:14:07.880]  of following through on it simply to earn these social brownie points that's what it's all about
[2:14:07.880 --> 2:14:12.200]  but i want to say great go ahead before before you want there's a paper by a colleague some
[2:14:12.200 --> 2:14:16.280]  marketing colleagues i don't remember the exact title of the paper but they say i mean speaking
[2:14:16.280 --> 2:14:22.680]  of virtue signaling they say going green to be seen right so instead of using let's say a Ferrari
[2:14:22.680 --> 2:14:28.360]  to impress you get that Prius boy it shows that you are green and you are serious and you can
[2:14:28.360 --> 2:14:34.520]  hug trees and so on yeah and again you find often in in these people's personal lives they they're
[2:14:34.520 --> 2:14:38.840]  not following through on any of this they're not really green people they don't really give a damn
[2:14:38.840 --> 2:14:43.640]  they just want the perception that they are to get the social brownie points but again staying on
[2:14:43.640 --> 2:14:48.920]  staying on social media i just want to move on to this you know these studies have shown that
[2:14:48.920 --> 2:14:54.120]  social media is making people more depressed despite the virtue signaling despite the social
[2:14:54.120 --> 2:14:58.920]  brownie points we've got an article here from the atlantic and we touched upon this with
[2:14:58.920 --> 2:15:05.240]  antony gucciardi earlier the flight from conversation the psychologist sherry turkle argues that
[2:15:05.240 --> 2:15:11.080]  replacing face-to-face communication with smartphones is diminishing people's capacity
[2:15:11.640 --> 2:15:17.320]  for empathy we also have the studies showing that you know facebook makes people depressed because
[2:15:17.320 --> 2:15:22.920]  it creates this false impression that everybody else's life is so dynamic and so interesting
[2:15:22.920 --> 2:15:29.560]  theirs isn't then we've got the the interaction with this article which of course is a you know in
[2:15:29.560 --> 2:15:35.400]  the real world social interaction is a crucial element of maintaining emotional stability
[2:15:35.400 --> 2:15:40.200]  and happiness but in terms of the cyber world it seems to have the opposite effect it only
[2:15:40.200 --> 2:15:46.200]  seems to make people more alienated when they're using these supposed social networks it only
[2:15:46.200 --> 2:15:51.880]  seems to be making them more disconnected from other people and more unhappy so why is this
[2:15:51.880 --> 2:15:56.520]  happening and you know what impact is this growing obsession with narcissism which i think you've
[2:15:56.520 --> 2:16:02.440]  also talked about having you know on just the way that humans behave how they interact with each other
[2:16:02.440 --> 2:16:08.040]  and how their brains are wired well there's there's a great study that i think was conducted
[2:16:08.040 --> 2:16:12.920]  a longitudinal study over 70 years i might get some of the details wrong where they sort of looked
[2:16:12.920 --> 2:16:19.000]  at longitudinally what ultimately makes people happy and i think the the leader of that project
[2:16:19.000 --> 2:16:24.280]  sort of summarized it by simply saying something to the effect of you know just have meaningful
[2:16:24.280 --> 2:16:28.680]  relationships with people that love love you and love and you love them back or something to that
[2:16:28.680 --> 2:16:36.200]  effect we are a social species right one of the reasons why uh uh placing somebody in solitary
[2:16:36.760 --> 2:16:41.640]  confinement could be considered cruel and unusual punishment even though putting them out in general
[2:16:41.640 --> 2:16:47.960]  public might expose them to being knived and shanked and killed and raped well people are willing
[2:16:47.960 --> 2:16:54.920]  to take that risk because ultimately to put me alone is maybe a greater punishment than me having
[2:16:54.920 --> 2:17:02.120]  to face an onslaught of aggressive folks at least i am amongst others and so i think what what social
[2:17:02.120 --> 2:17:07.640]  media does to some extent it is good it allows me to reconnect with people that i might not have seen
[2:17:07.640 --> 2:17:14.040]  since my childhood in lebanon but on the other hand once taken to an extreme it is very isolating and
[2:17:14.040 --> 2:17:19.960]  i mean frankly i've to come to it at times right where my wife will come to me and say and she'll
[2:17:19.960 --> 2:17:24.360]  say something like did you please get off you know your social media and just pay a bit of attention
[2:17:24.360 --> 2:17:31.400]  to us it's a very intoxicating set of portals because it makes us feel as though we're connected
[2:17:31.400 --> 2:17:37.560]  with the world but paradoxically it also disconnects us from those that maybe are closest to us
[2:17:38.840 --> 2:17:44.360]  we're talking to professor gad sad his youtube channel is youtube.com forward slash gad sad
[2:17:44.920 --> 2:17:49.800]  racing through the topics here i want to mention universities and free speech because obviously
[2:17:49.800 --> 2:17:54.360]  you're a professor you move amongst these people some of them are your friends you know trigger
[2:17:54.360 --> 2:18:00.360]  warnings safe spaces this complete intolerance for intellectual diversity on college campuses
[2:18:00.360 --> 2:18:07.800]  is banning feminists and anti-feminists recently at manchester university they had an event called
[2:18:08.360 --> 2:18:14.680]  does feminism have a problem with free speech and they banned a feminist and an anti-feminist
[2:18:14.680 --> 2:18:21.160]  julie bindel and mylo enopolis because they might trigger god forbid they might challenge the ideas
[2:18:21.160 --> 2:18:26.920]  of the people who attend that university so when did universities go from you know being arenas of
[2:18:26.920 --> 2:18:32.600]  vigorous unrestrained debate to progenitors of thought control and censorship and who's the blame
[2:18:33.720 --> 2:18:41.000]  well i think it's a confidence of factors you know post-modernism came in and about 40 years
[2:18:41.000 --> 2:18:47.160]  ago and said hey look there are no privileged ways of knowing there are no absolute truths
[2:18:47.160 --> 2:18:53.640]  there are no human universals all viewpoints are reasonable and could be held right and so who
[2:18:53.640 --> 2:18:59.320]  are you to say that the gravity is what makes something fall maybe it's i love that term i heard
[2:18:59.320 --> 2:19:05.240]  it on drunken presence from that maybe it's intelligent falling instead so so that so this
[2:19:05.240 --> 2:19:13.160]  idea that all possible frameworks are acceptable creates this sort of fake tolerance right where
[2:19:14.360 --> 2:19:18.680]  you know who are we to judge about what is true or not and so when somebody comes with a very
[2:19:18.680 --> 2:19:24.280]  dogmatic position then they recoil at that especially when that dogmatic position goes
[2:19:24.280 --> 2:19:30.280]  against the politically correct position and so i think because of a very variety of confluence of
[2:19:30.280 --> 2:19:38.120]  factors uh both academics and students are not armed to engage in reason debate we'll be back
[2:19:38.120 --> 2:19:43.560]  with gad sad after the break of course no less than edward snowden came out against this yesterday
[2:19:43.560 --> 2:19:48.920]  in a tweet he said quote an individual trying to limit speech at universities is interested in neither
[2:19:48.920 --> 2:19:54.840]  university nor justice that's what edward snowden said about this yesterday we'll be back final

[2:24:58.680 --> 2:25:04.760]  wake people up to start conversations and it all goes to helping this broadcast to building the
[2:25:04.760 --> 2:25:09.880]  platform that we've basically slaved over for the past 20 years to get to this level where
[2:25:09.880 --> 2:25:15.640]  we're having a direct impact on the narrative challenging the mainstream media on all these
[2:25:15.640 --> 2:25:20.760]  issues coming up tonight david night's going to be the host for infowall's nightly news
[2:25:21.320 --> 2:25:24.840]  and they're going to be covering the debate the democratic debate live of course
[2:25:24.840 --> 2:25:31.320]  this is the first debate only six are scheduled so this is going to be a short process because
[2:25:31.320 --> 2:25:36.360]  hillary clinton is completely afraid of saying anything whatsoever in public that's going to be
[2:25:36.360 --> 2:25:43.480]  interesting cnn anderson cooper's that he's not going to try to mix up the candidates david night
[2:25:43.480 --> 2:25:49.160]  will be will be grilling them will be analyzing them on their actual platform what they actually
[2:25:49.160 --> 2:25:55.320]  stand for rather than the sound bites rather than the surface fluff and that's all going to be live
[2:25:55.320 --> 2:26:01.560]  tonight infowall's nightly news hosted by david night so we're sure to tune in for that we're
[2:26:01.560 --> 2:26:08.600]  talking to behavioral scientist gad sad youtube.com forward slash gad sad i wanted to touch on radical
[2:26:08.600 --> 2:26:15.000]  islam because this is a subject that you've devlin to of course whenever i go really hard against
[2:26:15.000 --> 2:26:23.400]  islam on social media on infowalls.com and merely question whether it deserves the title of the
[2:26:23.400 --> 2:26:31.400]  religion of peace i immediately get death threats again proving my point and you know i posted an
[2:26:31.400 --> 2:26:37.560]  image of isis toilet roll on facebook got death threats consistently for about two weeks which
[2:26:37.560 --> 2:26:42.200]  again is why a question whether it's a religion of peace but you've been critical of some of the
[2:26:42.200 --> 2:26:48.840]  tenets of islam you've looked at the quran and you've criticized liberals for basically not daring
[2:26:48.840 --> 2:26:55.800]  to oppose what is fundamentally an illiberal belief system so how are liberals able to excuse and
[2:26:55.800 --> 2:27:02.440]  justify their immediate abandonment of liberal principles when it comes to criticism of islam
[2:27:03.000 --> 2:27:08.760]  i think that's the big blind spot of so-called liberals or again i prefer to call them the
[2:27:08.760 --> 2:27:15.080]  regressive leftist a term that is really taking off in the public discourse i think it's because
[2:27:15.080 --> 2:27:24.920]  they make the mistake of assuming that islam is a people is a religion of the marginalized of
[2:27:24.920 --> 2:27:32.440]  people of color and therefore when i look into my playbook of liberalism and progressive progressivism
[2:27:33.000 --> 2:27:38.200]  i know that i should not be criticizing people of color because we all know that it's the
[2:27:38.200 --> 2:27:43.480]  patriarchy that's bad it's the white man that's bad and and therefore i'm faced here with a
[2:27:43.880 --> 2:27:50.520]  dilemma is it okay for me to criticize the behavior of others if they score high on the
[2:27:50.520 --> 2:27:57.000]  victimology poker hand or not now there is a new brand of liberals and i like to think that i'm
[2:27:57.000 --> 2:28:04.840]  included in that group that says look if you truly believe in fundamental liberal values then you have
[2:28:04.840 --> 2:28:12.360]  to expect that all ideologies are fair game when it comes to criticism regrettably the regressive
[2:28:12.360 --> 2:28:20.360]  lefts leftists are not willing to do that again because they view it as racist phobic bigoted
[2:28:20.360 --> 2:28:27.720]  to criticize an ideology when when we repeatedly state that you are not attacking individuals
[2:28:27.720 --> 2:28:34.600]  most moslems are undoubtedly perfectly lovely people and yet the ideology to which they subscribe
[2:28:34.600 --> 2:28:40.520]  might contain tenets that are open for criticism surely that should be a liberal value that we
[2:28:40.520 --> 2:28:47.320]  all hold dear they don't and even the pope came out you know after charlie hebdo and said you
[2:28:47.320 --> 2:28:51.480]  shouldn't make fun of people's religions you shouldn't insult people's religions that's not
[2:28:51.480 --> 2:28:56.200]  part of free speech again i was breathtaking i just couldn't believe what he said that absolutely
[2:28:56.200 --> 2:29:01.160]  astonishing what i wanted to ask though is you know we've had polls in france a few months ago
[2:29:01.160 --> 2:29:08.520]  they found that 25 percent of young people in france this is 18 to 25 year olds 25 percent
[2:29:08.520 --> 2:29:13.080]  in france support isis that doesn't mean they're violent militants it doesn't mean they're going
[2:29:13.080 --> 2:29:18.600]  to go and be terrorists but ideologically they support isis we found similar numbers in other
[2:29:18.600 --> 2:29:22.840]  european countries how i'll ask this question after the break we're going to talk about that
[2:29:22.840 --> 2:29:27.400]  we're going to give gad sad the final word on evolutionary consumption as well and we're going
[2:29:27.400 --> 2:29:32.760]  to plug his youtube channel tell you how you can get his books this is the alex joneshow live again

[2:30:19.960 --> 2:30:26.200]  hammer mish is now worried that a disgruntled student might bring a gun into the classroom
[2:30:26.200 --> 2:30:30.840]  and start shooting the issue is not so much somebody coming into the classroom from the outside
[2:30:30.840 --> 2:30:36.840]  it's rather a student in the classroom or more likely a student in my office who's upset about
[2:30:36.840 --> 2:30:41.160]  a grade and who pulls a gun on me i'm not going to carry a gun i don't want to be involved in the
[2:30:41.160 --> 2:30:47.320]  gunfight so apparently paranoid professor hammer mish would rather see his students left defenseless

[2:33:17.160 --> 2:33:22.680]  we've got
[2:33:27.000 --> 2:33:30.760]  it's the alex jones show live i'm your host paul joseph watson we're just finishing up here in
[2:33:30.760 --> 2:33:35.560]  the final five minutes with gad sad we'll be going to your calls after that before the break i just
[2:33:35.560 --> 2:33:40.600]  mentioned radical islam again it's a topic that i've covered it's a topic that gad sad has
[2:33:40.600 --> 2:33:47.320]  covered on his youtube channel again polls in france 25 of young people show ideological support
[2:33:47.320 --> 2:33:53.960]  for isis similar polls in other european countries just quickly on this gad sad how wide of the mark
[2:33:53.960 --> 2:34:01.880]  is this idea the advocates of radical islam are only a tiny tiny minority well i guess it depends
[2:34:01.880 --> 2:34:07.640]  how we define extremists right and i think sam harris tried to make that point so if you say
[2:34:07.640 --> 2:34:13.080]  an extremist somebody who holds very violent views and is willing to act on them well then it might
[2:34:13.080 --> 2:34:19.080]  be just a very small few percentages if it's people who who support those guys but then are
[2:34:19.080 --> 2:34:24.920]  not willing to themselves engage in the actual violence then it becomes much larger so if you
[2:34:24.920 --> 2:34:30.680]  like the concentric circle gets larger depending on how we define extremism but even if the number
[2:34:30.680 --> 2:34:37.160]  were very small right i mean let's let's let's be charitable and say five percent of all the people
[2:34:37.160 --> 2:34:42.760]  who are adherents of islam uh are the most problematic well five percent of 1.6 billion
[2:34:42.760 --> 2:34:50.200]  people is still a very sizable number and so to argue that it is irrational it is islamophobic
[2:34:50.200 --> 2:34:57.320]  right it is a term that actually makes it insane for you to be afraid of that threat right you are
[2:34:57.320 --> 2:35:03.560]  insane you suffer from an irrational phobia if you're fearful of that five percent that's how
[2:35:03.560 --> 2:35:09.080]  again you shut down debate right because people are going to think twice before they try to criticize
[2:35:09.080 --> 2:35:14.680]  an ideology that's going to certainly come after you if not physically to harm your reputation so
[2:35:14.680 --> 2:35:20.280]  there is something to worry about and the more people get up to talk about it the better it will
[2:35:20.280 --> 2:35:26.360]  be for our future and again just because you criticize radical belief systems like radical
[2:35:26.360 --> 2:35:31.000]  islam doesn't mean that you hate muslims just because you criticize radical feminism which
[2:35:31.000 --> 2:35:36.600]  the vast majority of women don't even embrace doesn't mean that you hate women now let's take
[2:35:36.600 --> 2:35:40.840]  a go ahead i'm sorry let me i was going to say let me just take a very simple example uh there is
[2:35:40.840 --> 2:35:44.840]  a prayer in Judaism that says something to the effect of you know thank you god for not making
[2:35:44.840 --> 2:35:50.840]  me a woman uh now if i say you know i think that that particular prayer is important it's
[2:35:50.840 --> 2:35:55.800]  misogynistic i am making a specific statement about that particular tenant it doesn't mean
[2:35:55.800 --> 2:36:01.000]  that i am anti-jewish or anti-Semitic same idea with Islam i could look at a particular tenant
[2:36:01.000 --> 2:36:06.920]  and criticize it without in no way implying any hatred or bigotry to people who are adherents
[2:36:06.920 --> 2:36:12.760]  of that religion okay just finishing up i wanted to give you basically an open platform for a couple
[2:36:12.760 --> 2:36:18.840]  of minutes evolutionary consumption you founded this field of study explain to the listeners
[2:36:18.840 --> 2:36:23.800]  what this is and what it tells us about human behavior so basically contrary to most consumer
[2:36:23.800 --> 2:36:28.120]  psychologists all consumer psychologists of life came along which basically looked at consumer
[2:36:28.120 --> 2:36:32.600]  behavior as something that's learned right we are socialized to become consumers we learn it from
[2:36:32.600 --> 2:36:37.480]  advertising we learn it from movies we learn it from our parents from our peers i came along and
[2:36:37.480 --> 2:36:43.480]  said well of course the environment matters yes part of what makes us consumers is our unique
[2:36:43.480 --> 2:36:50.520]  environments but there must be some indelible features of our evolutionary history that manifests
[2:36:50.520 --> 2:36:56.600]  itself when we put when we put on our consumer hats and so the work that i do looks at these
[2:36:56.600 --> 2:37:00.760]  biological underpinnings so let me just give you a tangible example in case some of your viewers
[2:37:00.760 --> 2:37:07.000]  might not know what i'm talking about so i did a study where i looked at how how do women alter
[2:37:07.000 --> 2:37:11.480]  their beautification practices how do they dress do they dress more sexually or less
[2:37:11.480 --> 2:37:16.840]  do they wear makeup or not and i looked at that as a function of where they were in their menstrual
[2:37:16.840 --> 2:37:22.360]  cycle specifically i argued that at the point of their menstrual cycle where they are in the
[2:37:22.360 --> 2:37:28.520]  ovulatory phase in the fertile phase this is where they would want to advertise themselves in the
[2:37:28.520 --> 2:37:33.240]  mating markets right and therefore we did a study this was one of my former doctoral students
[2:37:33.240 --> 2:37:39.800]  where we tracked women's behavior for 35 continuous days because 35 days covers the length of most
[2:37:39.800 --> 2:37:46.120]  menstrual cycles and we exactly found that when women are maximally fertile they signal right to
[2:37:46.120 --> 2:37:50.280]  go back to the signaling question that we were talking about earlier well that particular
[2:37:50.280 --> 2:37:55.880]  research question would have never been within the purview of a consumer psychologist who who
[2:37:55.880 --> 2:38:01.160]  didn't recognize that consumers are biological beings that are shaped by these evolutionary
[2:38:01.160 --> 2:38:07.560]  forces so what i try to do basically is marry biology and evolutionary theory in the context
[2:38:07.560 --> 2:38:12.840]  of consumer behavior and some of your videos on this have been really fascinating again just in
[2:38:12.840 --> 2:38:19.160]  closing tell people how they can find your youtube channel your twitter and some of your books right
[2:38:19.160 --> 2:38:23.720]  so uh my books if you go to amazon all my books are listed there's the consuming instinct the
[2:38:23.720 --> 2:38:27.880]  evolutionary basis of consumption evolutionary psychology and the business sciences i hope you
[2:38:27.880 --> 2:38:34.360]  check them out i have a youtube channel so slash uh i don't remember the exact thing but but if you
[2:38:34.360 --> 2:38:40.120]  do get sad you'll find me uh each of my videos videos is called the sad truth and whatever the
[2:38:40.120 --> 2:38:44.840]  number is of that video i cover all sorts of things evolutionary psychology consumer behavior
[2:38:44.840 --> 2:38:51.800]  politics the fox police religion and then of course they could follow me on twitter at gad gad sad

[2:39:53.000 --> 2:39:59.560]  gonna definitely love gad sad just google it it took me right to his twitter so real easy to find
[2:39:59.560 --> 2:40:07.560]  and that's why am i calling you uh i am in iowa do you know the significance of that sure if you
[2:40:07.560 --> 2:40:13.480]  make us mad we'll elect your president that's what we do here in iowa uh we have the first in the
[2:40:13.480 --> 2:40:20.920]  nation iowa caucus and that's a little bit different than the primary well what we got coming up here
[2:40:20.920 --> 2:40:27.880]  in october it's a saturday october 24th about two weeks i'm gonna have all the republican
[2:40:27.880 --> 2:40:33.080]  presidential candidate i'm an executive director for organization national organization called
[2:40:33.080 --> 2:40:41.160]  patriots for christ patriots for christ usa paul where we are not politically correct we're
[2:40:41.160 --> 2:40:46.920]  biblically correct and i think what people worry about with political correctness is they're
[2:40:46.920 --> 2:40:51.800]  going to offend somebody and be obnoxious they don't want to appear obnoxious and i do that anyway
[2:40:51.800 --> 2:40:59.000]  but being biblically correct i'm less likely to do that so uh again so we got the president's why
[2:40:59.000 --> 2:41:06.680]  did i call paul i'm going to be there in it now there may be a specific candidate candidate you'd
[2:41:06.680 --> 2:41:13.160]  like to ask a question of and you don't have jeb bush there and one of his shills to do it
[2:41:13.880 --> 2:41:19.080]  i'm going to do it and in my organization will do it it's going to be a town hall question and
[2:41:19.080 --> 2:41:25.240]  answer but for those people uh that can't make it we're going to have them twitter their question
[2:41:26.360 --> 2:41:31.320]  are you still with me paul sounds good to me be sure to uh call us back and tell us what happened
[2:41:31.320 --> 2:41:35.960]  but sounds like a very good idea to challenge some of these republican candidates especially
[2:41:35.960 --> 2:41:41.400]  on their flip-flopping when it comes to the likes of donald trump erica in ohio you're on the air
[2:41:41.400 --> 2:41:49.320]  go ahead erica i pleasure to talk to you i wanted to say that uh wanted to plug the x2 it's also
[2:41:49.320 --> 2:41:56.440]  very good topically um i got stung by a b i do landscaping i get stung frequently uh usually
[2:41:56.440 --> 2:42:02.920]  it swells and hurts for hours but i put the x2 on it and i forgot i even got stung a half hour
[2:42:02.920 --> 2:42:10.360]  later i also use it um for an acne spot treatment it works good on acne as well um a good way that
[2:42:10.360 --> 2:42:16.600]  i wake people up is i have them try a bite of a gmo strawberry and then i have them try a bite of an
[2:42:16.600 --> 2:42:21.960]  organic strawberry there is a big difference in taste there and then they're usually open to hear
[2:42:21.960 --> 2:42:28.200]  whatever else i have to say yeah i mean the reason that i'm calling oh go ahead no i'm just saying i
[2:42:28.200 --> 2:42:33.160]  mean these these reviews are unsolicited we don't ask people to call in and say this stuff
[2:42:33.160 --> 2:42:37.800]  which is why if you look on the actual info wars store dot com website we have all these
[2:42:37.800 --> 2:42:41.640]  independent third party reviews of people who've got these products and they work for them and we
[2:42:41.640 --> 2:42:46.360]  get people calling in the show on a regular basis advocating these products again completely
[2:42:46.360 --> 2:42:51.880]  unsolicited which is why you know people are really resonating with the efficacy of these
[2:42:51.880 --> 2:42:57.240]  different nutrients and supplements x2 nascent iodine being one of them but go ahead what was
[2:42:57.240 --> 2:43:03.640]  your other point today um my little brother is in high school he was a junior last year and
[2:43:03.640 --> 2:43:09.400]  i got him to start listening to the show with me um last year when he was a junior his history
[2:43:09.400 --> 2:43:15.480]  teacher told him that the constitution was only meant to last 50 years they're trying to teach
[2:43:15.480 --> 2:43:20.920]  children that the constitution is outdated and that we need something new no and you see that
[2:43:20.920 --> 2:43:27.160]  in a lot of the the exam papers really robbishing the constitution introducing the idea that it's
[2:43:27.160 --> 2:43:32.760]  you know amenable changeable and really not treat not teaching true american history teaching this
[2:43:32.760 --> 2:43:38.040]  progressive slant on everything that america is bad and that we have to atone for our sins and all
[2:43:38.040 --> 2:43:42.600]  that kind of stuff so you know it's really a problem and it's why homeschooling is becoming
[2:43:42.600 --> 2:43:48.920]  more and more popular thanks for the call erica joer kim in pennsylvania you're on the air go ahead
[2:43:49.320 --> 2:43:53.960]  oh hello hey you got you go ahead you're on the air what's your point today i first
[2:43:53.960 --> 2:44:01.320]  want to say i'm delighted to be on the air with you and i am a info warrior um i want to make two
[2:44:01.320 --> 2:44:07.560]  points today it's simply and as beautifully as i can in a positive sense and you've been asking for
[2:44:07.560 --> 2:44:15.480]  positive input input which we need sure sounds good go ahead we're overwhelmed as a nation and a world
[2:44:15.480 --> 2:44:23.880]  with uh the information just invading us all areas i'm a man that's focused and um one of the things
[2:44:23.880 --> 2:44:33.320]  i want to stop today with you and say mr obama made a statement to the nation about trusting him
[2:44:34.280 --> 2:44:44.200]  and government that hit me because uh this is the issue for informed people for people that are
[2:44:44.200 --> 2:44:54.840]  aware of what's going on there is no trust uh and perhaps it's uh time for us to boldly step up and
[2:44:54.840 --> 2:45:03.080]  say well our us motto has been in god we trust even the fed put it on our money and god we trust
[2:45:03.080 --> 2:45:09.160]  maybe somebody would say which god and that would be a great question to uh to discuss well yeah
[2:45:09.160 --> 2:45:14.360]  we've got the article on info wars dot com obama american suspicious of government
[2:45:14.360 --> 2:45:19.160]  is paralyzing and you know he's made similar comments on this in the past he's he's actually
[2:45:19.160 --> 2:45:25.160]  almost directly not by name but it was obvious called out alex jones for encouraging people
[2:45:25.160 --> 2:45:31.000]  to have distrust in government it's not alex jones's fault that people have distrust in government
[2:45:31.000 --> 2:45:35.800]  it's not info wars' fault that they have distrust in government it's the fact that you can't trust
[2:45:35.800 --> 2:45:39.800]  government that's who's to blame for that so when obama tries to shift the blame and
[2:45:39.800 --> 2:45:45.000]  say that this is paralyzing his agenda why is that a bad thing that's a good thing trust
[2:45:45.000 --> 2:45:51.160]  in media trusting government is that an all-time low of course it does have negative side effects
[2:45:51.160 --> 2:45:56.600]  where people will then go out and trust anybody else doesn't necessarily mean that just because
[2:45:56.600 --> 2:46:01.160]  somebody's saying something different from the mainstream media that that's immediately true
[2:46:01.160 --> 2:46:06.520]  you still have to have discernment but again that's positive from you know the angle of
[2:46:06.520 --> 2:46:12.040]  not trusting government is what brings freedom you need gridlock you need dissent you don't want
[2:46:12.040 --> 2:46:18.280]  the rah rah behind the president you know 90 approval rating because that's how tyranny happens
[2:46:18.280 --> 2:46:23.640]  that's how the constitution gets shredded and that article is up on the drudge report obama
[2:46:23.640 --> 2:46:29.640]  american suspicion of government is paralyzing key article there by steve watson go and read that
[2:46:29.640 --> 2:46:36.440]  loren in ohio with solutions you're in the air loren go ahead yeah absolutely and the solution is
[2:46:36.440 --> 2:46:41.640]  we understand what this country is that constitution is a body of negative law to control the maids and
[2:46:41.640 --> 2:46:46.920]  the butlers the workers for government not to tell the free people how they should live so if we
[2:46:46.920 --> 2:46:51.320]  understood that and the fact that the declaration of independence what is the purpose of government
[2:46:51.320 --> 2:46:57.320]  to protect life liberty and the pursuit of happiness for all men so um here's the solution
[2:46:57.320 --> 2:47:01.880]  obey god first it's 10 little commandments who wants to be murdered who wants to be stolen from
[2:47:01.880 --> 2:47:06.600]  if we would do the way god says to do we wouldn't have these problems number two keep your money
[2:47:06.600 --> 2:47:12.840]  in your pocket stop paying tax money that you don't owe why don't you look up the um uh u s uh
[2:47:12.840 --> 2:47:19.080]  statute that um that basically tells you what it's your election to be in the government
[2:47:19.080 --> 2:47:27.880]  and pay taxes or not and i believe it's 26 usd 6013 g4 a is how to exempt yourself to
[2:47:27.880 --> 2:47:32.920]  send notification to the irs to withdraw your signatures from the w4 the contract where you're
[2:47:32.920 --> 2:47:37.720]  going to give them your money number three keep your children in your home if you or or privately
[2:47:37.720 --> 2:47:42.680]  school them meaning you could hire a teacher six people on a block hire a teacher and have that
[2:47:42.680 --> 2:47:47.560]  teacher teacher children what you want to learn the mass indoctrination would not be possible
[2:47:47.560 --> 2:47:52.200]  except that we have these massive public school institutions okay thanks for the call
[2:47:52.200 --> 2:47:55.240]  we'll have to stick with three for now because we've got these calls holding
[2:47:55.240 --> 2:47:57.880]  matt in oklahoma has been waiting a while matt you're on the air go ahead
[2:47:59.000 --> 2:48:02.280]  hey thanks for having me on uh i'm going to try to bounce around real quick as
[2:48:02.280 --> 2:48:06.600]  as fast as i can because i have a lot of stuff that you guys will find interesting uh the odd
[2:48:06.600 --> 2:48:11.560]  thing that i heard this morning you know is on npr which is kind of a strange source for this but
[2:48:11.560 --> 2:48:17.960]  they said that uh playboy is no longer going to be uh publishing uh fully nude women in their magazines
[2:48:17.960 --> 2:48:23.240]  because the political atmosphere has changed too much so they've totally you know neutered if you
[2:48:23.240 --> 2:48:28.600]  will uh get down to maximum level status so i don't know you know what that means for the
[2:48:28.600 --> 2:48:33.720]  magazine industry or whatnot i mean this this is a thing this is the theme that we've seen with
[2:48:33.720 --> 2:48:39.720]  sex negative feminists you know whether you agree with nude women in playboy playboy or not i mean
[2:48:39.720 --> 2:48:44.680]  whether you agree with porn or not it's about preventing women from making their own choices
[2:48:44.680 --> 2:48:50.520]  you know they're banning grid girls they're banning all kinds of avenues for women to have careers
[2:48:50.520 --> 2:48:56.280]  by using their attractiveness by using their good looks and it's basically again ugly obnoxious
[2:48:56.280 --> 2:49:02.120]  feminists that nobody is attracted to hating attractive successful women that's what it boils
[2:49:02.120 --> 2:49:08.280]  down to and that's why this politically correct wave of sex negativism preventing women from
[2:49:08.280 --> 2:49:12.920]  doing what they want to we're seeing it more and more and we're seeing it today playboy says it will
[2:49:12.920 --> 2:49:19.320]  no longer print images of nude women so again that is another story which we posted up on the website
[2:49:20.040 --> 2:49:28.200]  john in texas you're on the air go ahead john yes good afternoon i was talking about uh here in
[2:49:28.200 --> 2:49:35.960]  austin yesterday there was an incredible display of kim trail or vapor trail as one would receive it
[2:49:35.960 --> 2:49:42.120]  and the reason i'm calling is for the people that have a problem with the kim trail explanation
[2:49:42.920 --> 2:49:48.040]  they would say to me well commercial airlines are flying and just the conditions today are
[2:49:48.040 --> 2:49:53.400]  ripe for vapor trails and there's just vapor trails all over the place well today the conditions
[2:49:53.400 --> 2:49:59.000]  are the same and anybody take a look outside there's not a single single one hadn't been all day
[2:49:59.000 --> 2:50:05.960]  and uh yesterday i mean the sky was painted there was so many of them and then also commercial
[2:50:05.960 --> 2:50:11.960]  airliners run in corridors and the whole sky was painted with vapor or kim trail just you would
[2:50:11.960 --> 2:50:17.320]  have it if i wanted to bring that up and i wish that there would be somebody that's got the scientific
[2:50:17.320 --> 2:50:24.680]  whatever or the money to take some samples of the dust uh that's falling on the city this week
[2:50:24.680 --> 2:50:29.080]  and have it analyzed and see what they've been spraying on us they actually did analyze some of
[2:50:29.080 --> 2:50:33.160]  that i think it was back five or six years ago there was a news channel that analyzed it but it
[2:50:33.160 --> 2:50:37.400]  turned out that the original tests were wrong so it's still up for debate obviously different

[2:54:15.880 --> 2:54:20.840]  final segment of the alex germanshore of course we got the fourth hour coming up with david night
[2:54:20.840 --> 2:54:26.760]  mosco's embassy rocketed after u.s. armed al-nuzra calls for killing russians this is an article
[2:54:26.760 --> 2:54:33.880]  by kurt nimo up on info wars dot com after the u.s. provided insurgents in syria with tons for
[2:54:33.880 --> 2:54:39.880]  ammunition and weapons the russian embassy in damascus was struck by two rockets afp reports
[2:54:39.880 --> 2:54:46.040]  claim the rockets were fired by islamist rebels from the eastern edge of the capital no deaths or
[2:54:46.040 --> 2:54:51.560]  injuries were reported but obviously now they're targeting russia because of russia's air strikes
[2:54:51.560 --> 2:54:57.160]  against syria again this is about a week after john mccain came out and said basically we need
[2:54:57.160 --> 2:55:03.160]  to arm the rebels to an even greater degree so they can shoot down russian fighter jets again
[2:55:03.160 --> 2:55:09.000]  threatening to cause world war three and he basically said just like we did in afghanistan
[2:55:09.000 --> 2:55:14.200]  just like we armed jihadists in afghanistan which of course you know that was a cakewalk
[2:55:14.200 --> 2:55:19.320]  wasn't it that had no bad consequences whatsoever only the rise of al-qaeda i saw him have been
[2:55:19.320 --> 2:55:25.000]  logged in and 9 11 yeah what could go wrong right so they've given these weapons to the fsa jihadists
[2:55:25.000 --> 2:55:29.640]  they hand them on to al-nuzra they hand them on to these other jihadist groups they hand them on to
[2:55:29.640 --> 2:55:35.960]  isis in many cases they defect to isis and now we've got jihadists just outside of damascus
[2:55:35.960 --> 2:55:44.200]  rocket attacking the russian embassy we've also got zero hedge reporting us paragraphs 50 tons of
[2:55:44.200 --> 2:55:49.480]  ammo to syrian rebels so it was in the media you know we're scaling back the arming of the syrian
[2:55:49.480 --> 2:55:56.760]  rebels they trained four or five moderates a cost of 500 million dollars a complete failure of a
[2:55:56.760 --> 2:56:02.280]  policy if you believe it was ever meant to fail in the first place now that russia is actually
[2:56:02.280 --> 2:56:09.320]  wiping out isis these nato armed these u.s. armed jihadists are targeting russia to an even greater
[2:56:09.320 --> 2:56:15.400]  degree because they don't want russia to wipe out isis because isis is allied with nato in terms of
[2:56:15.400 --> 2:56:20.280]  toppling bashar al-asad final caller mike in wyoming you're on the air go ahead mike
[2:56:22.520 --> 2:56:28.360]  yes hi paul i i tried to make this point once before but apparently didn't get get across
[2:56:28.360 --> 2:56:34.680]  uh there's a good book called surrendering islam uh by a guy in livingston that explains
[2:56:34.680 --> 2:56:40.840]  this radical fun so-called fundamentalist islam in in saudi and the other gulf states
[2:56:40.840 --> 2:56:46.680]  it was created by british intelligence back in the middle of the 19th century for the purpose of
[2:56:46.680 --> 2:56:54.120]  of uh imploding islam from within uh they used a uh uh whacked out character named
[2:56:54.120 --> 2:57:01.880]  abdul wahab as in wahabi uh who hated islam wanted to go back to the pre islamic uh
[2:57:02.760 --> 2:57:09.560]  pagan gods and uh this you can uh distinguish these guys by the the black satanic
[2:57:10.200 --> 2:57:15.320]  uniforms and flags that they fly they are not true islam even though they've been led to believe
[2:57:15.320 --> 2:57:21.000]  that they are that's not to say that ordinary islam is necessarily compatible with the west but
[2:57:21.000 --> 2:57:27.160]  but these guys the you know the al-nusra's and the and the isis and these other related sects
[2:57:27.160 --> 2:57:34.600]  are are heretics within islam and we don't want to go to war with with the entire islamic world
[2:57:34.600 --> 2:57:40.840]  and it's important to make that distinction so uh no it definitely is and i don't think that's a
[2:57:40.840 --> 2:57:47.640]  distinction that really translates i mean in in a sense isis have become rock stars to many muslims
[2:57:47.640 --> 2:57:52.600]  even immigrants living in european countries we mentioned the polls earlier you know 25 percent
[2:57:52.600 --> 2:57:58.440]  of young people in france support isis so it's a major problem tearing down this image that isis
[2:57:58.440 --> 2:58:04.680]  represents all islam or the cool the hip the edgy side of islam when of course it's completely
[2:58:04.680 --> 2:58:09.080]  barbaric that's going to do it though for the alex germshaw we've got david night coming up
[2:58:09.080 --> 2:58:13.960]  for the fourth hour basically we're going to have a live coverage of the democratic debates

[2:59:54.600 --> 3:00:08.600]  from his central texas command center deep behind enemy lines the information war continues
[3:00:08.600 --> 3:00:11.800]  it's alex jones and the gcn radio network
[3:00:14.920 --> 3:00:19.960]  welcome to the alex jones show i'm david night your host for this fourth hour the news wrap up
[3:00:19.960 --> 3:00:24.040]  and we're going to talk a little bit about what's coming up tonight the democrat debate of course
[3:00:24.040 --> 3:00:28.120]  we're going to be covering that live as part of the nightly news that'll begin at seven central
[3:00:28.120 --> 3:00:32.440]  eight p.m eastern that's when our news broadcast begins the debate will begin about a half hour
[3:00:32.440 --> 3:00:36.120]  into that broadcast so we're going to pick it up cover it live like we did during the money
[3:00:36.120 --> 3:00:42.200]  bomb we're going to have live comments you'll also be able to contact us via twitter hashtag
[3:00:42.200 --> 3:00:48.280]  dem debate dem debate you'll be able to send us your questions your comments and we're going to
[3:00:48.280 --> 3:00:53.640]  take a look at it because you know it's interesting to see how cnn is talking about how differently
[3:00:53.640 --> 3:01:00.440]  they're going to cover this debate than they did the GOP debate cnn uh anderson cooper will be the
[3:01:00.440 --> 3:01:07.080]  moderator this time they had jake tapper moderate the last GOP debate which was on cnn anderson cooper
[3:01:07.080 --> 3:01:12.920]  says he's not going to try to mix this up and put one candidate against another well we are
[3:01:13.480 --> 3:01:17.160]  we're going to put them against their records we're going to put them against themselves
[3:01:17.160 --> 3:01:22.040]  essentially as well as against each other i think it might be more interesting than people think
[3:01:22.040 --> 3:01:25.800]  i don't think bernie sanders is going to rock the boat and i think hillary clinton is going to
[3:01:25.800 --> 3:01:30.920]  play it pretty safe unless somebody gets her mad but i think that you've got three candidates there
[3:01:30.920 --> 3:01:37.400]  two of them especially web and o'Malley who are pretty intelligent i think they will come out
[3:01:37.400 --> 3:01:43.640]  swinging because they realize that from a horse race standpoint this is essential for their survival
[3:01:43.640 --> 3:01:49.160]  we had a dnc officer say she was disinvited from this particular debate because she had asked for
[3:01:49.160 --> 3:01:54.360]  more of them they're only going to have six democrat debates it's a very very controlled process
[3:01:54.360 --> 3:01:57.320]  so we're going to talk about that but we've got other things that we want to talk about as well
[3:01:57.320 --> 3:02:03.080]  because you know there's a race coming up for the house speaker interesting to see how this is
[3:02:03.080 --> 3:02:07.160]  developed because remember back during the summer before they went on recess mark meadows from north
[3:02:07.160 --> 3:02:13.000]  carolina introduced a motion for bainer to vacate the seat they laughed about it said oh that's not
[3:02:13.000 --> 3:02:17.640]  going to go anywhere then they counted heads and they realized he could very well lose that motion
[3:02:17.640 --> 3:02:22.840]  so they tabled it they went to recess and twisted some arms found out they still couldn't do it so
[3:02:22.840 --> 3:02:28.760]  bainer abruptly announced his resignation or his retirement after the after meeting with the pope
[3:02:29.480 --> 3:02:33.880]  then they came up to the point where they had an election scheduled it was a private election which
[3:02:33.880 --> 3:02:38.760]  would precede the general election on the floor they were going to select a republican candidate
[3:02:38.760 --> 3:02:43.800]  so they could not be divided when they went to the floor because it's possible that a democrat
[3:02:43.800 --> 3:02:49.000]  could get elected if you divide it up between several republicans at that meeting the front
[3:02:49.000 --> 3:02:53.960]  runner as you probably know by now kevin mccarthy stood up and abruptly resigned at that point
[3:02:53.960 --> 3:02:58.280]  bainer stopped the meeting there was wailing heard and he said we're not going to have the
[3:02:58.280 --> 3:03:02.360]  election now there were two candidates there how do you get away with doing something like that i
[3:03:02.360 --> 3:03:08.840]  think that shows exactly what the problem is with bainer with government in general bainer acts
[3:03:08.840 --> 3:03:14.360]  exactly like a dictator we talk about obama acting like a dictator yes he does executive orders doing
[3:03:14.360 --> 3:03:18.920]  whatever he pleases he says he's going to go around congress he doesn't want to wait for them to do
[3:03:18.920 --> 3:03:23.560]  this or that so he's not going to go through the process of that we see that the congress has said
[3:03:23.560 --> 3:03:28.200]  they don't want to bother with the process of ratifying a treaty so they passed the fast track
[3:03:28.200 --> 3:03:34.680]  trade authority and now we've got bainer saying if you don't have my candidate in there we're going
[3:03:34.680 --> 3:03:39.720]  to just stop the election i will stay in office until i get a handpicked candidate that i want
[3:03:40.440 --> 3:03:45.480]  is that the kind of government we want i mean this is absolutely amazing to me had two other
[3:03:45.480 --> 3:03:50.200]  candidates and he just stops the election so we're going to take a look at what's going on with
[3:03:50.200 --> 3:03:55.240]  some of these other candidates of course the one that he wants is paul ryan and he's putting out
[3:03:55.240 --> 3:04:01.400]  his demands his lists about how he wants to be presented the job without any conditions without
[3:04:01.400 --> 3:04:06.120]  any questions about anything that he does essentially he wants to be fast tracked just
[3:04:06.120 --> 3:04:10.840]  like the trade agreements that's what he's demanding when drudge linked to the article and i think the
[3:04:10.840 --> 3:04:16.120]  article is still linked up on drudge he basically called him you know a king he's acting as if he's
[3:04:16.120 --> 3:04:20.760]  an heir apparent to the throne and that's the way they're acting i think they need to revive
[3:04:20.760 --> 3:04:24.600]  this motion to vacate the chair they need to say hey we need to call a vote on this what's
[3:04:24.600 --> 3:04:29.800]  going on so we're going to take a look at that as well there's also some interesting spy tech
[3:04:29.800 --> 3:04:36.840]  that's coming up darpa has a project called the icarus project for their drones it's very ominous
[3:04:36.840 --> 3:04:41.080]  we're going to talk about what's behind that at the same time google is saying that they're not
[3:04:41.080 --> 3:04:46.680]  going to start putting sensors on their robot cars uh not their robot cars but the ones that are
[3:04:46.680 --> 3:04:51.640]  mapping out the cars they're going to put sensors on those cars to measure pollution all the way down
[3:04:51.640 --> 3:04:56.840]  to cigarette smoke see that's where this is headed not just control of transportation
[3:04:56.840 --> 3:05:00.360]  it's a complete surveillance grid stay with us we'll be right back presidential candidates
[3:05:00.360 --> 3:05:05.720]  today strategize over every last detail of a candidate's image especially an identity
[3:05:05.720 --> 3:05:10.840]  candidate like hillary how important is it for there to be a woman president in the united states
[3:05:11.560 --> 3:05:17.080]  national journal has pointed out that candidates now view soundtracks as a key part of that carefully
[3:05:17.080 --> 3:05:23.480]  crafted image so maybe hillary should choose a campaign song that plays against type you know
[3:05:23.480 --> 3:05:32.280]  humble i'm sorry hillary has paid a consulting firm nine thousand dollars to create a soundtrack
[3:05:32.280 --> 3:05:38.120]  for her campaign i just don't think people would believe this song though she's being abandoned
[3:05:38.120 --> 3:05:44.760]  by unions by multinational corporate donors who are worried 44 percent of her twitter followers
[3:05:44.760 --> 3:05:53.640]  1.4 million are fake maybe her campaign theme should be help i need somebody help not just
[3:05:53.640 --> 3:06:01.880]  anybody for wars dot com i'm david night your liver can be full of fatty deposits built up

[3:07:11.320 --> 3:07:15.960]  it's something that really has been hiding in plain view for over 100 years the federal government
[3:07:15.960 --> 3:07:21.560]  mandated from the 20s until the 70s that iodine a crude form of it be added to table salt because
[3:07:21.560 --> 3:07:26.120]  of the incredible health problems that dietary deficiency and iodine was causing i want to
[3:07:26.120 --> 3:07:30.840]  challenge the listeners who've not tried x2 for yourselves what do you have to lose you are the

[3:07:55.160 --> 3:08:07.480]  calling 888-253-3139 ease the t-rex of political talk alex jones on the gcn radio network
[3:08:11.560 --> 3:08:15.480]  welcome back to the alex jones show i'm david night your host on this fourth hour we're going
[3:08:15.480 --> 3:08:18.840]  to look at the news wrap up and we're going to talk a little bit about what's coming up tonight
[3:08:18.840 --> 3:08:25.000]  with the first of only six democrat debates people are anxiously waiting to see what's
[3:08:25.000 --> 3:08:30.680]  going to happen maybe i don't know if anybody's watching it but i think there's going to be
[3:08:30.680 --> 3:08:36.280]  something to watch quite frankly i think that there's going to be some candidates omali and
[3:08:36.280 --> 3:08:41.240]  web who are absolutely desperate they will come out swinging i don't think that uh i don't think
[3:08:41.240 --> 3:08:46.680]  that sanders is much of a fighter when you look at what happened with black lives matter he really
[3:08:46.680 --> 3:08:52.200]  didn't uh he's kind of very passive i don't know maybe he doesn't have really any hardcore things
[3:08:52.200 --> 3:08:57.240]  that he believes in because quite frankly if you do believe in something enough i can't see how you
[3:08:57.240 --> 3:09:02.760]  can be that passive about it but maybe uh he will wake up tonight and say something but i think the
[3:09:02.760 --> 3:09:07.160]  other candidates will i think that if they don't uh they're finished they can stick a fork in it
[3:09:07.160 --> 3:09:11.720]  because they're already at essentially zero percent but we have some interesting candidates
[3:09:11.720 --> 3:09:16.120]  that are kind of come up and we're going to be covering it live we're going to have our comments
[3:09:16.120 --> 3:09:19.720]  we're going to be comparing what they say to what they've said before uh we're going to be
[3:09:19.720 --> 3:09:23.320]  comparing what they say they will do to the constitution and we're going to talk a little
[3:09:23.320 --> 3:09:28.440]  bit about that and you'll be able to join us with hashtag dem debate we're also going to talk in
[3:09:28.440 --> 3:09:33.800]  this hour about some developments in the house speaker race because i think it's absolutely
[3:09:33.800 --> 3:09:40.600]  appalling that john bainer could just suspend an election and it's still suspended ignoring
[3:09:40.600 --> 3:09:46.040]  the motion to vacate the chair this is the kind of authoritarian dictatorship that he has established
[3:09:46.040 --> 3:09:51.240]  there that's why there's rebellion against him it isn't simply about the fact that they make promises
[3:09:51.240 --> 3:09:56.040]  to the electric that they have no intention of following through with it is also the way that
[3:09:56.040 --> 3:10:02.120]  he conducts himself as a petty tyrant in a dictator so we're going to take a look at that as well
[3:10:02.120 --> 3:10:08.680]  as well as some really creepy new technology that's coming from darpa and from google darpa
[3:10:08.680 --> 3:10:14.760]  wants a drone program that will vanish into thin air after they use it they call it project
[3:10:14.760 --> 3:10:20.040]  icris and we're going to talk about what's involved with that why would the defense department want
[3:10:20.040 --> 3:10:25.880]  something like that based on what we have seen recently with the bombing of a hospital with the
[3:10:25.880 --> 3:10:30.600]  assassinations continuously of drones i can imagine a lot of reasons why our government the
[3:10:30.600 --> 3:10:34.760]  way they conduct themselves abroad why they would want something that would disappear
[3:10:34.760 --> 3:10:39.480]  like a mission impossible message machine disavowing any knowledge or any presence that
[3:10:39.480 --> 3:10:44.200]  they've been there before that's precisely what they're looking at with this device also google
[3:10:44.200 --> 3:10:50.920]  wants to start using its cars not just map streets but to map pollution levels and this brings up the
[3:10:50.920 --> 3:10:57.480]  whole issue of information sharing between corporations spying on you using total surveillance
[3:10:57.480 --> 3:11:02.760]  passing that information on to the government and then using that to establish a total control
[3:11:02.760 --> 3:11:06.200]  grid so we're going to talk about both of those before i get into the news however i won't let
[3:11:06.200 --> 3:11:12.760]  you know that we've extended our sale on info wars storeable foods right now at infowarstore.com

[3:11:54.440 --> 3:11:58.520]  all right let's talk about this technology first before we go to politics because this is something
[3:11:58.520 --> 3:12:02.200]  that i think is very very dangerous and we always need to understand that they're going to sell the
[3:12:02.200 --> 3:12:08.440]  DARPA technology to us as something that is going to be beneficial to all mankind okay this is like
[3:12:08.440 --> 3:12:13.720]  the aliens in the twilight zone who come to earth and they've got this book to serve mankind and
[3:12:13.720 --> 3:12:18.440]  then you find out the end it's a cookbook okay that's precisely what this is about DARPA is about
[3:12:18.440 --> 3:12:24.600]  creating weapons folks it's about creating weapons they have always been a part of the weapons system
[3:12:25.560 --> 3:12:31.240]  we had an excellent interview with a lady who is the author of Ann Jacobson who wrote the pentagon
[3:12:31.240 --> 3:12:36.600]  brain i would recommend that book to you it puts all of this in a historical context you can see
[3:12:36.600 --> 3:12:42.120]  what these people have been doing for 60 plus years after the operation paper clip where they
[3:12:42.120 --> 3:12:46.280]  brought german scientists over and and just see how this has gone off the rails but here's the
[3:12:46.280 --> 3:12:51.160]  latest example of this DARPA wants drones that will vanish into thin air they call it project
[3:12:51.160 --> 3:12:56.360]  icris and they've even got their own little acronym here so cute they always do this inbound
[3:12:56.360 --> 3:13:02.040]  controlled air-releasable unrecoverable systems and they say this is a story from popular science
[3:13:02.040 --> 3:13:07.880]  and they always like to put a happy spin on all these grim technology stories i always like to say
[3:13:07.880 --> 3:13:12.600]  this is expendable single-use drones that can carry supplies to those in need because that's
[3:13:12.600 --> 3:13:16.440]  that's what they're going to be doing they're going to be giving food to the soldiers in the
[3:13:16.440 --> 3:13:21.160]  field well they may do some of that but if you're just doing that why do you need to have this thing
[3:13:21.160 --> 3:13:27.160]  disappear well they say it's a it's a real hassle to uh to bring the stuff back really is that really
[3:13:27.160 --> 3:13:31.720]  what you need it for listen to the way that it's going to disappear and of course naming it after
[3:13:31.720 --> 3:13:39.000]  icris they're referring consciously to the uh greek mythology figure the guy who got wings of
[3:13:39.000 --> 3:13:43.880]  wax and he flew too close to the sun the wings melted and he crashed to the earth and that's
[3:13:43.880 --> 3:13:47.960]  what they're looking for but they're looking for a drone that will vanish within four hours of
[3:13:47.960 --> 3:13:55.960]  delivery to its target or within 30 minutes of twilight and as even popular science points out
[3:13:55.960 --> 3:14:03.720]  it makes the drone as much of a vampire as a robot okay so that's that's what you're looking at you
[3:14:03.720 --> 3:14:08.600]  know when they have all these projects of uh robots and everything it's not so that they can go in
[3:14:09.160 --> 3:14:14.920]  and control a nuclear emergency at the plant like Fukushima yeah it could be used for something
[3:14:14.920 --> 3:14:20.760]  like that but they're creating these robots they've got in mind a terminator system they got in mind
[3:14:20.760 --> 3:14:25.960]  economists killing machines that's where they're headed with all this stuff they're headed to
[3:14:25.960 --> 3:14:32.040]  an arms race with that but when we look at this drone thing especially in light of the most recent
[3:14:32.040 --> 3:14:37.240]  atrocity from the obama administration where they continually attack the hospital for 30 minutes
[3:14:37.240 --> 3:14:42.040]  and i've mentioned this many times and i think we really need to hammer this hypocrisy from obama
[3:14:42.040 --> 3:14:48.600]  that two days after the shooting in oregon his military shoots up a hospital that people knew
[3:14:48.600 --> 3:14:52.680]  about for quite a long time they've been notified repeatedly about this they've been given the
[3:14:52.680 --> 3:14:57.560]  gps coordinates about it and they had been notified just a couple of days before this happened
[3:14:57.560 --> 3:15:02.040]  and as it was happening it wasn't a single bomb that landed on this hospital it was under continuous
[3:15:02.040 --> 3:15:09.240]  attack for 30 minutes 30 minutes while they called both the afghan and the pentagon the afghan
[3:15:09.240 --> 3:15:15.640]  government and the pentagon telling them that they were under attack this is a war crime when you
[3:15:15.640 --> 3:15:21.240]  deliberately target hospitals and of course we got a different answer every day from the pentagon
[3:15:21.240 --> 3:15:25.400]  now they have finally come out and said well we're going to pay the families but we're not going to
[3:15:25.400 --> 3:15:30.920]  give you any details about how this happened or what we might possibly do to change it so rather
[3:15:30.920 --> 3:15:38.360]  than investigate this because doctors against doctors without borders is not trying to do what
[3:15:38.360 --> 3:15:42.760]  i think they ought to do and that is go for a war crimes investigation they're simply saying
[3:15:42.760 --> 3:15:46.600]  we would like to open up an investigation to see how this happened we'd like an explanation
[3:15:47.240 --> 3:15:53.480]  obama can't be bothered obama won't travel to the area he won't do any kind of an investigation
[3:15:53.480 --> 3:15:57.160]  they're stonewalling on this other than saying that they're going to give them money but they're
[3:15:57.160 --> 3:16:02.280]  not going to admit that they did anything wrong meanwhile obama goes to oregon and grandstands
[3:16:02.280 --> 3:16:07.640]  over a shooting that happened from one individual who was most likely from everything we've seen hyped
[3:16:07.640 --> 3:16:14.040]  up on drugs this is the way they roll this is the hypocrisy with which they roll and of course
[3:16:14.040 --> 3:16:18.280]  that's why they would like to have a drone that would disappear because they're doing
[3:16:18.280 --> 3:16:23.160]  open assassinations you remember back in the nineteen sixties and seventies it was absolutely
[3:16:23.160 --> 3:16:28.600]  outrageous during the church hearings when the cia admitted that they were involved in assassination
[3:16:28.600 --> 3:16:35.400]  attempts that they had these specialized guns that could not be traced that would shoot the bullet
[3:16:35.400 --> 3:16:41.080]  and the bullet would dissolve now we have a government that openly engages in drone assassinations
[3:16:41.080 --> 3:16:45.960]  and openly talks about the fact that it isn't necessarily the bullet that's going to dissolve
[3:16:45.960 --> 3:16:50.120]  but the delivery vehicle is going to dissolve so they can't trace it back to them
[3:16:50.920 --> 3:16:55.880]  that's the kind of criminal mindset of these people now we talk about things dissolving like
[3:16:55.880 --> 3:17:03.000]  vampires we need to realize that in the past we've had manning who went to jail exposing
[3:17:03.000 --> 3:17:09.320]  videos of the US military attacking innocent civilians and then shooting up the ambulance
[3:17:09.320 --> 3:17:14.040]  when it came and laughing about it we've talked about that we've shown that video that got the
[3:17:14.040 --> 3:17:19.160]  Pentagon so angry that they put manning in jail they tried to frame I believe Julian Assange and
[3:17:19.160 --> 3:17:23.480]  they've been surrounding him at the Ecuadorian embassy in London for over three years spent
[3:17:23.480 --> 3:17:33.160]  over 15 million dollars in putting a police cordon there 24 7365 now they are just pulling back but
[3:17:33.160 --> 3:17:39.640]  they have this interesting statement they said officers remain committed to executing the arrest
[3:17:39.640 --> 3:17:44.440]  warrant against Julian Assange and presenting him before the court and they vowed to deploy
[3:17:44.440 --> 3:17:51.960]  a number of overt and covert tactics to arrest him so there you go they're going to not be visible
[3:17:51.960 --> 3:17:58.200]  but that's the way they're going to take this finally I want to talk about in terms of our
[3:17:58.920 --> 3:18:04.440]  secret government here there was a an accident that happened this weekend and I really think
[3:18:04.440 --> 3:18:08.120]  you should take a look at these pictures this is on the Daily Mail this weekend it's a couple of
[3:18:08.120 --> 3:18:13.320]  teenagers 17 and 15 lost control their Mercedes in the wee hours of the morning on Saturday and
[3:18:13.320 --> 3:18:19.320]  both died the car crashed at high speed into a tree does that sound familiar Mercedes crashing
[3:18:19.320 --> 3:18:24.040]  into a tree at high speed do you remember the death of Michael Hastings do you remember when we
[3:18:24.040 --> 3:18:28.760]  said that it couldn't happen like that it wouldn't look like that if they crashed into a tree well
[3:18:28.760 --> 3:18:35.720]  you can see what it looks like when a Mercedes C350 the exact same model that Hastings had actually
[3:18:35.720 --> 3:18:41.400]  the engine is different the C350 that they were driving is a six cylinder engine he had a 250
[3:18:41.400 --> 3:18:47.880]  which is a four cylinder turbo charge but it's the same vehicle look at how that disintegrated
[3:18:47.880 --> 3:18:53.240]  notice there was no fire notice that the engine wasn't ejected at a right angle when it struck the
[3:18:53.240 --> 3:18:59.080]  tree rather the car was cut into half okay you don't eject the engine when you hit a tree
[3:18:59.960 --> 3:19:05.000]  you capture the engine into the car if you're going to have a fire it's necessary for the rear
[3:19:05.000 --> 3:19:10.440]  end to be compromised remember the pinto rear end fires that they burst into flames because
[3:19:10.440 --> 3:19:15.080]  the rear end was not protected when you look at the pictures and there's you can see that one picture
[3:19:15.080 --> 3:19:20.600]  all the devastation is right there at the passenger level and we said at the time it was possible
[3:19:20.600 --> 3:19:23.560]  that the car could have been hijacked it could have been driven at high speed it could have
[3:19:23.560 --> 3:19:29.000]  then been blown up down the road that caused the engine to eject down the road and then the car
[3:19:29.000 --> 3:19:34.520]  to turn into that tree because you look at that when that hit that tree it's not crashed so take
[3:19:34.520 --> 3:19:38.760]  a look go to the internet take a look at this take a look at the pictures of Michael Hastings
[3:19:38.760 --> 3:19:43.960]  go to the Daily Mail story take a look at that car and ask yourself if we're crazy conspiracy
[3:19:43.960 --> 3:19:50.600]  theorist it's just like the buildings that didn't fall down all the skyscrapers they don't fall
[3:19:50.600 --> 3:19:55.960]  down when they catch fire folks they're designed not to do that and you don't you can't fly planes
[3:19:55.960 --> 3:20:00.440]  at that speed at that level and we had three three buildings that fell down supposedly two planes
[3:20:00.440 --> 3:20:03.960]  they will this will be right back worry about the health and safety of you and your loved ones

[3:24:04.600 --> 3:24:13.160]  n radio network welcome back to the alex jones show i'm david night your host in this fourth hour
[3:24:13.160 --> 3:24:20.040]  on this tuesday october 13th 2015 tonight is going to be the first of only six democrat debates and
[3:24:20.040 --> 3:24:27.720]  i say only because debbie waserman schultz who is an unshakable ally of hillary clinton basically
[3:24:27.720 --> 3:24:33.240]  is not going to change anything she punished uh one lady who uh a representative congresswoman
[3:24:33.240 --> 3:24:37.560]  from hawaii who said that she thought there ought to be more debates uh she was disinvited
[3:24:37.560 --> 3:24:42.200]  from the debate she'll be watching that at home in hawaii because you know you just don't push
[3:24:42.200 --> 3:24:47.080]  back against the power brokers in washington whether it's the democrats like waserman schultz or
[3:24:47.080 --> 3:24:53.080]  whether it's republicans like john bainer this is a dictatorship of the leadership in in charge
[3:24:53.640 --> 3:24:58.760]  now we had an article up yesterday about the dismal democrat debate by curtain mo we had some
[3:24:58.760 --> 3:25:05.720]  interesting quotes in there from john whitehead pointing out that really this is not going to
[3:25:05.720 --> 3:25:10.120]  change things in america but i think it's very important to be aware of what's going on because
[3:25:10.120 --> 3:25:15.960]  you need to know the direction that we're going you need to understand where the people who want
[3:25:15.960 --> 3:25:20.440]  to take your freedoms are going that's one of the reasons to watch this he says the american
[3:25:20.440 --> 3:25:24.840]  people remain eager to be persuaded that a new president in the white house can solve the problems
[3:25:24.840 --> 3:25:29.320]  that plague us yet no matter who wins this next presidential election you can rest assured the
[3:25:29.320 --> 3:25:35.160]  new boss will be same as the old boss we the permanent underclass in america will continue
[3:25:35.160 --> 3:25:41.720]  to be forced to march in lockstep with a police state and in all matters public and private that's
[3:25:41.720 --> 3:25:46.040]  john w whitehead he says establishment presidential candidates from clinton to bush and the rest of
[3:25:46.040 --> 3:25:51.640]  the single digiters are show horses for the one percent elite those who are the controllers the
[3:25:51.640 --> 3:25:55.640]  masterminds of shadow government the police state the surveillance state the military industrial
[3:25:55.640 --> 3:26:01.800]  complex understand that no matter which party occupies the white house in 2017 the unelected
[3:26:01.800 --> 3:26:08.040]  bureaucracy that actually calls the shots will continue to call the shots that's why i say when
[3:26:08.040 --> 3:26:12.440]  we look at these presidential elections it really is like being presented with a red pill and the
[3:26:12.440 --> 3:26:18.280]  blue pill except that they're both placebo's they're both there to make you feel that you're
[3:26:18.280 --> 3:26:22.680]  going to accomplish something that you're participating in something you need to be able
[3:26:22.680 --> 3:26:27.560]  that's why we have this permanent entrenched bureaucracy that the congress has abdicated
[3:26:27.560 --> 3:26:33.800]  their authority to and that's why i think our efforts need to be focused need to be focused
[3:26:33.800 --> 3:26:39.160]  at the local level where we can shut down that bureaucracy using state and local government
[3:26:39.160 --> 3:26:43.560]  and jury nullification and state nullification all the tools that we still have legally and
[3:26:43.560 --> 3:26:48.680]  constitutionally available to us we need to be trying to contain this out of control federal
[3:26:48.680 --> 3:26:52.920]  government this out of control federal bureaucracy but we need to understand who the enemies are so
[3:26:52.920 --> 3:26:59.320]  tonight we're going to cover this debate live you can follow this with dem hashtag dem debate
[3:26:59.320 --> 3:27:04.040]  you can make comments and questions to us we're going to be commenting on this debate as it moves
[3:27:04.040 --> 3:27:09.880]  along we're going to be comparing what they say to what they've said before and do what the constitution
[3:27:09.880 --> 3:27:14.280]  says and what we want to see happen understand too that with the democrats you're going to get
[3:27:14.280 --> 3:27:20.120]  a more honest presentation of where they want the big centralized government to go then you're
[3:27:20.120 --> 3:27:24.520]  going to get with republicans the republicans are always going to pay lip service to small
[3:27:24.520 --> 3:27:30.120]  government unless it's on foreign policy there they want the american empire that's going to
[3:27:30.760 --> 3:27:37.880]  basically go abroad and kick butt okay and no limits on what it's going to do but on most other
[3:27:37.880 --> 3:27:41.800]  issues they will talk about a small government they don't really mean it we've seen this from
[3:27:41.800 --> 3:27:48.120]  bainer we've seen it from all the leadership of the republican party and with the democrats
[3:27:48.120 --> 3:27:53.640]  you are going to see what they really want to do where they really want to go you need to watch it
[3:27:53.640 --> 3:27:58.360]  because you need to get yourself scared and fired up to do something not necessarily about the
[3:27:58.360 --> 3:28:03.400]  presidential race but something at the local level now when we look at what's going on tonight in
[3:28:03.400 --> 3:28:08.600]  terms of just the sheer horse race aspects of it the politics of it of course joe biden is not going
[3:28:08.600 --> 3:28:13.320]  to be there tonight but i certainly expect him to be jumping in he will probably wait until after
[3:28:13.320 --> 3:28:19.320]  the debate so that he can steal the thunder from whoever may rise up from it he may even
[3:28:19.320 --> 3:28:25.160]  announce during the debate who knows but cnn is basically begging him to show up they even
[3:28:25.160 --> 3:28:31.000]  tweeted out a picture of the podium said wave if joe jumps in we've got a podium already set up for
[3:28:31.000 --> 3:28:36.840]  him but it's also going to be interesting that cnn has already announced through anderson cooper
[3:28:36.840 --> 3:28:40.520]  that they're not going to pit the democrats against each other tonight like they did the
[3:28:40.520 --> 3:28:47.080]  republicans you remember how jake tapper would go in and he would uh say well you know as donald
[3:28:47.080 --> 3:28:53.240]  trump said this about you what do you think about that i mean it was like some kind of reality tv show
[3:28:53.240 --> 3:28:59.560]  like like i said it's like celebrity big brother uh where they uh mentioned individual digs that
[3:28:59.560 --> 3:29:03.160]  somebody's taken at each other and it's not just trump taking digs at other people it's other people
[3:29:03.160 --> 3:29:08.040]  taking digs at trump and so it was a constantly mixing it up with very very petty questions but
[3:29:08.040 --> 3:29:12.760]  of course anderson cooper says we're not going to do that with the democrats because these are all
[3:29:12.760 --> 3:29:19.160]  serious people because they're democrats they're serious this is a serious debate because it's
[3:29:19.160 --> 3:29:23.720]  a democrat debate and they want to talk about issues i want to give them an opportunity to do
[3:29:23.720 --> 3:29:27.800]  that well you know what i think some of the minor candidates are pretty smart i think they're going
[3:29:27.800 --> 3:29:31.160]  to come out swinging i think it's going to be interesting we're going to cover that tonight
[3:29:31.160 --> 3:29:36.120]  again the hashtag is dem debate we're going that coverage is going to start at 7 30 our nightly news
[3:29:36.120 --> 3:29:41.560]  starts at 7 central and the coverage of the debate will go for two hours beginning at 7 30 central

[3:30:29.800 --> 3:30:35.880]  from the outside it's rather a student in the classroom or more likely a student in my office

[3:33:07.080 --> 3:33:16.680]  war on for your mind. welcome back to the fourth hour of the alex jones show i'm david niger host
[3:33:16.680 --> 3:33:20.120]  as we were just talking in the last segment we're going to be covering the democrat debate
[3:33:20.920 --> 3:33:24.840]  live tonight with comments and the hashtag if you want to join us on that is going to be
[3:33:24.840 --> 3:33:30.920]  hashtag dem debate we'll be joining that about half hour after the nightly news begins leanne
[3:33:30.920 --> 3:33:36.040]  macadoo will be hosting the nightly news and then we'll be covering live the democrat debate with
[3:33:36.040 --> 3:33:41.400]  comments and i want to go back and talk about exactly what some of the issues before them are
[3:33:41.400 --> 3:33:45.640]  and how they've adjusted their position on some vital issues there's not too many issues that
[3:33:45.640 --> 3:33:50.360]  are really going to come up of any consequence i believe but of course there's going to be some
[3:33:50.360 --> 3:33:55.240]  like the transpacific partnership that i think may play into this tonight so it'll be interesting
[3:33:55.240 --> 3:34:00.680]  to hear back and forth about that perhaps this debate will serve the purpose of educating people
[3:34:00.680 --> 3:34:06.520]  as to the dangers of the transpacific partnership the only democrat candidate who has come out
[3:34:06.520 --> 3:34:11.480]  saying that he would support that and he's not a candidate yet officially joe is still biding his
[3:34:11.480 --> 3:34:17.240]  time but joe biden is still in support of the transpacific partnership the transatlantic
[3:34:17.240 --> 3:34:22.920]  partnerships but hillary clinton has now flip-flopped on her position and sanders has been
[3:34:22.920 --> 3:34:27.240]  against it from the very beginning so that might be one thing of substance that they may talk about
[3:34:27.240 --> 3:34:31.560]  tonight we'll see what happens before we get back to that i want to let you know that we now have a
[3:34:31.560 --> 3:34:40.520]  sale on secret 12 vitamin b12 is now 20 off at info wars life dot com 20 off of b12 it combines

[3:34:50.600 --> 3:34:56.200]  that you can do as a supplement uh you don't have to uh it's available in a liquid form and that's
[3:34:56.200 --> 3:34:59.800]  one of the things i like i like to take liquid supplements because i don't have a lot of pills
[3:34:59.800 --> 3:35:06.200]  to swallow again experience the power of ultra b12 with secret 12 at info wars life dot com get
[3:35:06.200 --> 3:35:12.680]  secret 12 for 20 off at info wars life dot com today and getting back to the debate uh what
[3:35:12.680 --> 3:35:17.160]  are the debate goals tonight there's a lot of people saying what do the candidates need to
[3:35:17.160 --> 3:35:22.440]  accomplish well course hillary clinton needs to convince people that she's real it's become
[3:35:22.440 --> 3:35:29.080]  such a joke that uh rolling stones last week said there is no real hillary clinton and what
[3:35:29.080 --> 3:35:32.840]  they were talking about of course was the way that she was flip-flopping on all these different
[3:35:32.840 --> 3:35:39.080]  issues she had supported the trans-pacific uh partnership transatlantic partnerships these
[3:35:39.080 --> 3:35:43.880]  secretly negotiated corporate deals that we still are not allowed to see even though they
[3:35:43.880 --> 3:35:49.960]  say they finished it more than a week ago the public is not allowed to see it only the corporations
[3:35:49.960 --> 3:35:56.200]  who wrote this are allowed to see it are you going to run as a candidate for a populist party
[3:35:56.840 --> 3:36:02.280]  and defend a secret trade agreement that was written by corporations that nobody is allowed
[3:36:02.280 --> 3:36:07.240]  to see and of course we know that it's about much more than trade far more than trade but now she
[3:36:07.240 --> 3:36:12.600]  says she's against it just like she says she's now against the keystone pipeline when in reality
[3:36:13.160 --> 3:36:17.880]  hillary clinton and the state department were the only parts of the obama administration that
[3:36:17.880 --> 3:36:22.200]  were for the keystone pipeline before so now she's been on all these different sides of the issue
[3:36:22.200 --> 3:36:27.160]  and again as i've said before my problem with the keystone pipeline is the fact that it involves
[3:36:27.160 --> 3:36:33.400]  the same kind of international multinational corporate cronyism that we see with these trade
[3:36:33.400 --> 3:36:37.400]  partnerships so-called partnerships or treaties they don't want to call them a treaty because they
[3:36:37.400 --> 3:36:41.800]  don't want to go through constitutional process to approve a treaty but they are treaties with
[3:36:41.800 --> 3:36:48.440]  the keystone pipeline they're going to allow a canadian company to confiscate people's farms with
[3:36:48.440 --> 3:36:53.880]  eminent domain so they can run their pipeline to it sorry that's a deal breaker for me it ought to
[3:36:53.880 --> 3:36:59.800]  be a deal breaker for you but i don't know what her opposition to keystone is now that she says
[3:36:59.800 --> 3:37:04.840]  she opposes it but that's why they were saying she wasn't real because as they put it she reinvents
[3:37:04.840 --> 3:37:10.680]  herself as often as you get a new model of phone and that shouldn't be the case but then of course
[3:37:10.680 --> 3:37:15.000]  yesterday there was on the drudge report another article where she made fun of that she says oh
[3:37:15.000 --> 3:37:20.040]  yes i'm not really a human being so we had at the top of the drudge report i'm not really even a human
[3:37:20.040 --> 3:37:24.840]  being she says i was i'm a robot i was created in a garage and you know what she's not artificial
[3:37:24.840 --> 3:37:29.240]  intelligence hillary is simply artificial no matter how many times they want to put her on saturday
[3:37:29.240 --> 3:37:36.840]  night live and sing with her uh i mean it just it is she's beyond phony and everybody realizes
[3:37:36.840 --> 3:37:41.800]  that even the democrats realize it so that's her challenge tonight what is bernie sanders challenge
[3:37:41.800 --> 3:37:46.840]  well he's trying to reinvent himself to make himself more attractive to the democrat mainstream
[3:37:46.840 --> 3:37:51.720]  and of course one of the things that he needs to do is to come around on gun control being from
[3:37:51.720 --> 3:37:58.200]  vermont he never really pushed it and so now he is and he's reversed himself on gun control just
[3:37:58.200 --> 3:38:04.680]  like hillary has reversed herself on these trade deals on the keystone pipeline in multinational
[3:38:04.680 --> 3:38:10.120]  crony capitalism bernie sanders is now showing his flexibility on gun control that's the way the
[3:38:10.120 --> 3:38:15.560]  wall street journal puts it you know that conservative republican paper they come out and they say
[3:38:15.560 --> 3:38:24.360]  bernie sanders signals flexibility on gun control no what he's signaling is that he is is cowtowing
[3:38:24.360 --> 3:38:30.120]  to the democrat uh orthodoxy saying that he's going to destroy the second amendment when before
[3:38:30.120 --> 3:38:36.040]  he wouldn't do that so if you say that you're going to destroy people's inalienable rights that are
[3:38:36.040 --> 3:38:40.920]  guaranteed in the constitution the wall street journal calls that flexibility listen to what he
[3:38:40.920 --> 3:38:47.720]  said on meet the press on sunday he says is there evidence that a manufacturers gun that
[3:38:47.720 --> 3:38:51.960]  a manufacturers that gun manufacturers do know that they're selling a whole lot of guns in an
[3:38:51.960 --> 3:38:57.960]  area that really should not be buying that many guns that many guns are going to these areas
[3:38:57.960 --> 3:39:03.880]  probably for criminal purposes that's what he said that's what he said on meet the press on sunday
[3:39:03.880 --> 3:39:08.520]  that's what bernie sanders said so he says you know if you're if you're a gun manufacturer and
[3:39:08.520 --> 3:39:14.760]  you're selling what bernie sanders thinks are too many guns in a particular area then maybe you've
[3:39:14.760 --> 3:39:19.480]  got some liability issues here because there shouldn't be that many guns going to that area
[3:39:19.480 --> 3:39:26.360]  who is he to decide how many guns people in a given area should be buying absolute nonsense
[3:39:26.360 --> 3:39:30.760]  and of course what he does is he comes out in support of an assault weapon ban you know that
[3:39:30.760 --> 3:39:37.320]  imaginary chimera the assault weapon that favorite thing of the left they don't even know what an
[3:39:37.320 --> 3:39:41.960]  assault weapon is an assault weapon is a gun that they're scared of and you know what they're scared
[3:39:41.960 --> 3:39:46.360]  of every single gun they don't have a definition of an assault weapon if they want to talk about it
[3:39:46.360 --> 3:39:53.560]  being a military style weapon well you know that is expressly permitted not permitted we don't get
[3:39:53.560 --> 3:39:58.120]  permission from the constitution it is expressly guaranteed that we have a right as a militia to
[3:39:58.120 --> 3:40:03.720]  own military weapons that's what the militia was about it was really for the militia to protect
[3:40:03.720 --> 3:40:08.520]  our country from foreign invaders from domestic governments that overstep themselves that was
[3:40:08.520 --> 3:40:14.040]  to be our line of protection not to have a standing army not to have a standing army of police
[3:40:14.040 --> 3:40:18.040]  or military in our country but that's what we have now now what are some of the other candidates
[3:40:18.040 --> 3:40:22.120]  going to do well they say they're going to play it safe anderson cooper is not going to really
[3:40:22.120 --> 3:40:27.320]  try to mix it up with these guys but i think that web and omali realized that they have to
[3:40:27.320 --> 3:40:32.920]  mix it up this is a quote from web he says isan howard it in the app about d-day in advance and
[3:40:32.920 --> 3:40:38.440]  of course web won a navy cross he won two purple hearts in vietnam he was head of the defense
[3:40:38.440 --> 3:40:43.000]  department for reagan i believe was his official title oh he was secretary of the navy sorry not
[3:40:43.000 --> 3:40:48.200]  the defense department he was secretary of the navy under president reagan then he ran as a democrat
[3:40:48.200 --> 3:40:56.840]  and won a senate from virginia so now he's back now chafee they say uh believes uh in ending drone
[3:40:56.840 --> 3:41:03.800]  strikes good he entertains the idea of rapprochement with the islamic state really you know we already
[3:41:03.800 --> 3:41:09.960]  equip and train isis what else can we do to make our relationships better with them but he does say
[3:41:09.960 --> 3:41:14.760]  that snowden did the right thing and he should come back to united states um so we'll see what
[3:41:14.760 --> 3:41:18.120]  happens with this it could be interesting there might be some interesting things about foreign
[3:41:18.120 --> 3:41:23.160]  policy web thinks that the united states has to focus its energies on asia he wrote an article
[3:41:23.160 --> 3:41:29.640]  in the day after september 11th 2001 in all caps he said do not occupy territory yeah well that's
[3:41:29.640 --> 3:41:34.200]  that's true and that was a big mistake for us to start occupying territory it's also a big
[3:41:34.200 --> 3:41:38.760]  mistake for us to follow the lies of the bush administration and attack a country that didn't
[3:41:38.760 --> 3:41:43.160]  have anything to do with it even by their own admission uh maybe what we should do is not only
[3:41:43.160 --> 3:41:48.360]  do not occupy but do not invade maybe that would be uh something that we you know i think i remember
[3:41:48.360 --> 3:41:54.440]  something about avoiding foreign entanglements uh from our original uh founders on the republican
[3:41:54.440 --> 3:42:00.520]  side we've got uh marco rubio winning the very first primary did you know that looks like he's
[3:42:00.520 --> 3:42:05.800]  going to win he's a shoe end to win the first primary what primary would that be not iowa not
[3:42:05.800 --> 3:42:11.960]  new hampshire no it's the sheldon primary sheldon adelson you know the guy that tried to rig the
[3:42:11.960 --> 3:42:18.920]  nevada caucus four years ago remember he had a uh a caucus that was for jews only remember that
[3:42:19.880 --> 3:42:25.320]  to try to uh to uh edge out uh ron paul well he's got a lot of money as a matter of fact he's got
[3:42:25.320 --> 3:42:29.560]  a lot more money than donald trump does he's got a fortune that they estimate at being about
[3:42:29.560 --> 3:42:35.160]  26 billion dollars and he throws that around in politics he throws that around to get senators
[3:42:35.160 --> 3:42:40.520]  who will support his ban on online gaming but his primary thing that he's concerned about
[3:42:40.520 --> 3:42:46.600]  is he wants somebody that is going to give unconditional support to israel and rubio is his
[3:42:46.600 --> 3:42:51.720]  man gingrich was the one who had the for sale sign around his neck last time for sheldon adelson
[3:42:51.720 --> 3:42:55.960]  and he got i think over 10 million dollars from sheldon adelson and now everybody is saying that
[3:42:55.960 --> 3:43:02.280]  marco rubio looks like he's going to win the adelson primary you know we had a lot of candidates
[3:43:02.280 --> 3:43:08.840]  who made that trip to kiss the ring of sheldon adelson uh not too long ago i think about the
[3:43:08.840 --> 3:43:13.480]  only two that i can remember not being there were uh rand paul and donald trump the rest of them
[3:43:13.480 --> 3:43:18.920]  pretty much uh sucking up to him uh for whatever scraps they could get thrown to them of course
[3:43:18.920 --> 3:43:23.960]  there's also another article today about uh ben carson just becoming a republican less than a year
[3:43:23.960 --> 3:43:30.280]  ago isn't that interesting i think it's interesting that not only did he not become a republican
[3:43:30.280 --> 3:43:35.560]  until then but when he registered to vote in maryland he didn't really participate too much
[3:43:35.560 --> 3:43:41.240]  he really wasn't very politically active he registered to vote in 2001 he voted in the general
[3:43:41.240 --> 3:43:50.200]  elections of 2004 six eight 10 and 12 but never in any primaries and i think that kind of explains
[3:43:50.840 --> 3:43:55.640]  why he really is kind of clueless when it comes to the constitution and individual liberty this
[3:43:55.640 --> 3:44:02.520]  is a guy who supports violating your informed consent he supported in the past uh the same
[3:44:02.520 --> 3:44:06.520]  types of stuff that we just heard from bernie sanders hey if you got a gun and you can have a
[3:44:06.520 --> 3:44:10.360]  gun if you live in the country but you know if you're in the city maybe people in the city
[3:44:10.360 --> 3:44:16.360]  shouldn't have guns absolutely clueless would he be the kind of brain surgeon you would want
[3:44:16.360 --> 3:44:21.240]  if he'd never read a book on anatomy well he's not the kind of president i want no matter how
[3:44:21.240 --> 3:44:26.760]  good a man he is no matter how honest he is he doesn't seem to be interested in understanding
[3:44:26.760 --> 3:44:31.720]  the fundamental principles that created this country i talked about this a little bit last night on
[3:44:31.720 --> 3:44:37.160]  the nightly news the back and forth about columbus day the controversy we've had nine cities most of
[3:44:37.160 --> 3:44:41.400]  them recent saying that they're not going to celebrate columbus day they're going to celebrate
[3:44:41.400 --> 3:44:47.400]  a um indigenous people's day or something like that and we played some comments from
[3:44:47.400 --> 3:44:52.600]  russell means who i respect a great deal russell means is very angry about columbus's history
[3:44:52.600 --> 3:44:56.760]  but you know there were bad things that columbus did there were bad things that happened with the
[3:44:56.760 --> 3:45:02.680]  native americans here they also had slavery and genocide and war it's not just something that was
[3:45:02.680 --> 3:45:11.080]  done by europeans where we need to come together is we need to look at our shared understanding
[3:45:11.080 --> 3:45:17.080]  of individual liberty what was enshrined in our constitution and we need candidates who have a
[3:45:17.080 --> 3:45:22.760]  history of that who have an experience of that who have passion for that we don't need people who
[3:45:22.760 --> 3:45:27.880]  are absolutely disinterested in that who simply want to put themselves up as president for whatever
[3:45:27.880 --> 3:45:32.840]  reason and we go back and we look at the party platform of the small independent and that was
[3:45:32.840 --> 3:45:39.800]  the other thing too he sought out a very small third party uh that was uh let's see what was the
[3:45:39.800 --> 3:45:44.920]  name of this it was the independence party of florida i looked through their their platform and
[3:45:44.920 --> 3:45:49.880]  their plank very very sketchy uh liberty now they don't talk about that except you know the
[3:45:49.880 --> 3:45:53.720]  uh life liberty and the pursuit of happiness but other than that they don't talk about liberty or
[3:45:53.720 --> 3:45:58.120]  freedom they talk about rights in a couple of places they do get some things right in terms of
[3:45:58.760 --> 3:46:04.200]  fiscal responsibility having recall of elected officials restrict taxing authority to only
[3:46:04.200 --> 3:46:10.040]  elected boards and that sort of thing a really kind of strange ad hoc collection of issues here
[3:46:10.040 --> 3:46:15.960]  they do put out the fact they think that healthcare should be a right i'm sorry but that's rights in
[3:46:15.960 --> 3:46:20.520]  my opinion let's understand this because brock obama understood this when he ran he made a
[3:46:20.520 --> 3:46:28.040]  distinction between negative rights and positive rights now he said and he was right brock obama
[3:46:28.040 --> 3:46:33.400]  said the constitution talked about negative rights it says you're going to have rights
[3:46:33.400 --> 3:46:36.600]  that are guaranteed that the government can't take these things away from you they can't
[3:46:36.600 --> 3:46:41.160]  infringe on them you know like obama is trying to take our second amendment rights and other freedoms
[3:46:41.160 --> 3:46:46.760]  he said that was what the founders set up and he said i don't agree with that he said that
[3:46:46.760 --> 3:46:50.760]  before we elected him president nobody paid any attention much he said i don't agree with that
[3:46:50.760 --> 3:46:54.200]  i think rights should be positive you know you have a right to food you have a right to this
[3:46:54.200 --> 3:46:58.280]  you have a right to healthcare which means that you've got to hold a gun to somebody else's head
[3:46:58.280 --> 3:47:04.600]  to provide that for you see that's a socialist right okay we're talking about libertarian
[3:47:04.600 --> 3:47:10.600]  rights the right to be left alone that's the right that's worth fighting for that's what we
[3:47:10.600 --> 3:47:15.800]  need to have but when you start talking about your entitlement programs as being rights now you've
[3:47:15.800 --> 3:47:20.680]  gone off the rails that's not what this country is about that's not going to work especially
[3:47:20.680 --> 3:47:24.520]  with open borders they know that that's why they're opening the borders because they want
[3:47:24.520 --> 3:47:29.880]  to take everything down now i also want to talk about the other race that's out here and that's
[3:47:29.880 --> 3:47:37.480]  the race for house speaker we had baner stepped down and then when it looked like when his
[3:47:37.480 --> 3:47:40.520]  candidate stepped down he said all right we're not going to have the election let's talk a little
[3:47:40.520 --> 3:47:45.400]  bit about a couple of the guys that would have been on that ballot for election let's talk about
[3:47:45.960 --> 3:47:52.200]  daniel webster i put up a i talked about this last week and we put up a video called the
[3:47:52.200 --> 3:47:56.600]  the devil and then daniel webster because that's essentially the choice that we've got right now
[3:47:56.600 --> 3:48:02.200]  is we've got some devils that are being put out there by by john baner and we've got daniel webster
[3:48:02.200 --> 3:48:06.600]  and it's interesting because you may not agree with daniel webster on every one of the issues
[3:48:06.600 --> 3:48:11.320]  but i think one of the things that he has right and he served as speaker of the house in florida
[3:48:11.960 --> 3:48:19.400]  and as articles from npr national review point out he essentially flattened the hierarchy that's
[3:48:19.400 --> 3:48:24.520]  what he's campaigning on he's saying i'm not going to dictate things like john baner that would be a
[3:48:24.520 --> 3:48:30.840]  huge start to do that to actually let the representatives that we've elected do some things
[3:48:30.840 --> 3:48:35.720]  rather than having a do what they were elected for follow some of the issues that they were
[3:48:35.720 --> 3:48:40.760]  elected for rather than throwing them out of committees and making them completely powerless
[3:48:40.760 --> 3:48:45.320]  if they don't do exactly as you dictate that's been the leadership style of john baner and
[3:48:45.320 --> 3:48:51.000]  we can still see that leadership style in the way he's handling the election to replace him
[3:48:51.000 --> 3:48:54.840]  shutting it down arbitrarily and saying we're not going to have an election until i get a
[3:48:54.840 --> 3:49:00.040]  candidate that i want so we had daniel webster who had been a speaker of the house in florida
[3:49:00.040 --> 3:49:06.360]  he said he wanted to flatten the pyramid of power also they say a national review that he has a
[3:49:06.360 --> 3:49:12.360]  surprisingly diverse appeal as speaker they say he's a legend in florida politics they say for a
[3:49:12.360 --> 3:49:17.640]  good solid 10 plus years daniel webster was florida politics not just republican but both
[3:49:17.640 --> 3:49:22.600]  and if he didn't sign off on something it didn't happen maybe we could get something
[3:49:23.640 --> 3:49:28.040]  maybe we should could get our representatives to actually do some of the things we've elected
[3:49:28.040 --> 3:49:34.520]  them to do if we got rid of this globalist leadership that is exactly the same as the
[3:49:34.520 --> 3:49:38.360]  democrats as i pointed out before one of the reasons to watch tonight is because the democrats
[3:49:38.360 --> 3:49:44.440]  are going to be honest about their agenda their globalist multinational corporatist agenda for
[3:49:44.440 --> 3:49:47.560]  the most part they'll lie about some of it they'll say they're not for the trans-pacific
[3:49:47.560 --> 3:49:52.120]  partnership when in reality they will support that but we need to understand where they're
[3:49:52.120 --> 3:49:57.160]  pushing for government because we know that unless we change the leadership in the house and the
[3:49:57.160 --> 3:50:02.520]  senate from mcconnell and bainer we are going to get exactly the same thing now one of the other
[3:50:02.520 --> 3:50:07.720]  guys who was running was jason chaffetz and there's been a controversy with him just like
[3:50:07.720 --> 3:50:11.320]  there was with kevin mccarthy the guy who stepped down the guy who is currently number two remember
[3:50:11.320 --> 3:50:16.280]  kevin mccarthy went on the sean hannity show and said that he bragged about the fact that
[3:50:16.280 --> 3:50:22.360]  hillary clinton's poll numbers plummeted after the bengazi investigation implying that that was the
[3:50:22.360 --> 3:50:27.080]  purpose of the bengazi investigation and quite frankly i think that was the purpose of the
[3:50:27.080 --> 3:50:32.120]  leadership simply to score cheap political points i don't think they wanted to put anybody in jail
[3:50:32.120 --> 3:50:35.800]  i don't think they wanted to change anything that's been the case over and over again with obama
[3:50:35.800 --> 3:50:42.040]  with clinton with eric holder now we have jason chaffetz in a controversy saying that he
[3:50:42.040 --> 3:50:47.400]  investigated planned parenthood and he didn't find anything wrong and he's had to walk those
[3:50:47.400 --> 3:50:51.960]  comments back saying no i wasn't talking about the baby part stuff we haven't investigated that
[3:50:51.960 --> 3:50:57.400]  still is that the kind of guy you want running that's the guy who his his entire family were
[3:50:57.400 --> 3:51:01.080]  insiders in the democrat party he reinvented himself as a tea party candidate say with us
[3:51:01.080 --> 3:51:09.240]  we'll be right back hey neighbor what are you doing digging you had a heart attack last year
[3:51:09.880 --> 3:51:14.920]  oh i know i was told no more hard labor then why are you digging well i've been taking

[3:54:11.240 --> 3:54:16.120]  don't call my name welcome back to the Alex Jones show I'm David Knight your host and this is our
[3:54:16.120 --> 3:54:21.880]  last segment of the fourth hour the news wrap-up joining us in this segment is Leanne McAdoo we're
[3:54:21.880 --> 3:54:27.080]  going to talk about what's coming up tonight on the nightly news it's interesting Leanne that there
[3:54:27.080 --> 3:54:33.160]  were literally hundreds of thousands of people protesting these secret multinational trade
[3:54:33.160 --> 3:54:38.040]  agreements in Europe and yet in America there's very little talk about it I think this may come
[3:54:38.040 --> 3:54:44.520]  up tonight when we cover the debate that may come up tangentially in the sense that Hilary Clinton
[3:54:44.520 --> 3:54:49.800]  has flip-flopped on this but what we see over and over again is that the democrats of course will
[3:54:49.800 --> 3:54:55.240]  avoid talking about the central issue which is one of sovereignty about trying to end sovereignty
[3:54:56.040 --> 3:55:01.160]  they will focus instead on a unions versus corporations aspect they will portray Hilary
[3:55:01.160 --> 3:55:05.880]  Clinton and rightfully so as a puppet of multinational corporations I guess maybe you know
[3:55:05.880 --> 3:55:09.640]  one of the songs that she could use in her playlist would be uh the one from Pinocchio
[3:55:09.640 --> 3:55:15.480]  I had strings but there's no strings on me now you know now I'm free maybe that's what she's
[3:55:15.480 --> 3:55:19.560]  going to try to sell people but it'll be interesting to see what happens tonight and we're going to be
[3:55:19.560 --> 3:55:25.080]  covering this the hashtag is a hashtag dem debate if you want to join us if you want to ask questions
[3:55:25.080 --> 3:55:29.720]  we're going to be commenting on it I like the mystery science 3000 yeah it's always it's always a
[3:55:29.720 --> 3:55:34.600]  fun time when we cover the debates it'll definitely be interesting to see if they even address her
[3:55:34.600 --> 3:55:40.920]  flip-flopping on the TPP and and other issues as well I think they're going to steer clear of
[3:55:41.960 --> 3:55:46.120]  whereas in the last debate they openly admitted that they were going to try and get them fighting
[3:55:46.120 --> 3:55:50.440]  amongst each other oh yeah here they're coming out trying to play the moral high ground we're
[3:55:50.440 --> 3:55:54.840]  not going to do that because we're not going to ask any hard questions well Anderson Cooper said
[3:55:54.840 --> 3:56:00.200]  these are serious candidates and they have serious issues they're not like republicans you know
[3:56:00.200 --> 3:56:04.600]  right yeah and they're turning this they're they're really selling this is this is going to be the
[3:56:04.600 --> 3:56:09.800]  greatest show on earth you know they set the podium up will he come won't he come will biden
[3:56:09.800 --> 3:56:13.880]  be there and and and they have it where you can actually if you own one of these virtual reality
[3:56:13.880 --> 3:56:19.560]  headsets you can watch the debate in 3d so they say you can see what the candidates are doing when
[3:56:19.560 --> 3:56:23.560]  the camera is not on them of course i'm sure they're not going to be able to go behind the
[3:56:23.560 --> 3:56:28.280]  candidates and see the strings that are pulling them moving their mouths oh exactly yeah well
[3:56:28.280 --> 3:56:32.200]  that's what we're going to be looking at and you know this is going to be into what you what you
[3:56:32.200 --> 3:56:37.000]  don't hear the questions that you don't hear ask these debates or what's really sad nobody ever
[3:56:37.000 --> 3:56:41.880]  questions their surveillance state nobody ever questions syspa or now syssa that they're coming
[3:56:41.880 --> 3:56:45.960]  after they don't have questions military industrial complex that's right that's right you don't get that
[3:56:45.960 --> 3:56:50.840]  kind of question ask and you know there's an article that just came out today google street
[3:56:50.840 --> 3:56:55.080]  view cars are now going to map the san francisco bay area with pollution levels and they're going
[3:56:55.080 --> 3:56:59.560]  to go down leon even to the cigarette smoke level and this is what we've been saying all along
[3:57:00.440 --> 3:57:05.000]  not only are they going to be using these robot cars from google self-driving cars they like to
[3:57:05.000 --> 3:57:08.360]  call them they're robot cars from google from uber not only are they going to use that to control
[3:57:08.360 --> 3:57:14.440]  our transportation but they're going to use it to have complete total surveillance total controller
[3:57:14.440 --> 3:57:19.400]  transportation total surveillance of us so they can spy on us so they can tax us and this is just
[3:57:19.400 --> 3:57:24.600]  one more example of how this is going to be used and they do this like a story we had about a year
[3:57:24.600 --> 3:57:30.360]  ago a week ago rather private database lets the police skirt license plate data limits they always
[3:57:30.360 --> 3:57:35.000]  do this like with syspa saying they're going to share information you turn this information over
[3:57:35.000 --> 3:57:39.240]  these companies so it's their information about you right so the companies can spy on you and
[3:57:39.240 --> 3:57:43.160]  not violate your fourth amendment they say and then they can turn that information over to the
[3:57:43.160 --> 3:57:47.480]  government that's the fiction that they use that's what's so concerning about this and everyone
[3:57:47.480 --> 3:57:52.440]  scoffed when we pointed out how the the green police commercial was really prepping you for
[3:57:52.440 --> 3:57:58.360]  this future green police and lo and behold it really is unfolding this way that's precisely
[3:57:58.360 --> 3:58:01.400]  what they're going to do so there's going to be talking any talk about that they're not going to
[3:58:01.400 --> 3:58:04.520]  talk about when they talk about the economy they're not going to talk about the federal reserve
[3:58:04.520 --> 3:58:10.280]  manipulating people i mean right we wouldn't want to go into that but we're going to go into that
[3:58:10.280 --> 3:58:14.840]  tonight we're going to talk about that even if they want so join us tonight we're going to be
[3:58:14.840 --> 3:58:18.760]  covering the news we'll start at seven central eight p.m. eastern the debate will start a half
