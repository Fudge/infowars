[00:00.000 --> 00:08.920]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:08.920 --> 00:12.640]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:12.640 --> 00:18.360]  That's right my friends, the information war now continues.
[00:18.360 --> 00:27.040]  It is Sunday, the 26th day of September, 2010, we're going to be live here for the next two
[00:27.040 --> 00:32.400]  hours as we are every Sunday 4 to 6 p.m. Central. I'll be back tomorrow 11 a.m. Central Standard
[00:32.400 --> 00:41.720]  Time live until 2 p.m. Central. Okay, I want to open the phones up for a question.
[00:41.720 --> 00:47.360]  I have four listeners and I'm going to do that after this first short segment in the
[00:47.360 --> 00:53.720]  second long segment that is coming up and it'll be first time calls again today because
[00:53.720 --> 00:59.000]  so many people are emailing me and texting me and sending me letters saying thank you
[00:59.000 --> 01:02.600]  that lately you've been spending a few days a week for first time callers because we've
[01:02.600 --> 01:05.160]  been trying for years to get through on air.
[01:05.160 --> 01:10.640]  We will do that again today coming up but the phones aren't open yet because I want
[01:10.640 --> 01:13.480]  to throw out the specific questions for you.
[01:13.480 --> 01:17.880]  I'd like you to answer those questions because I want to get your views on this and help
[01:17.880 --> 01:27.400]  stir my own personal mental juices as they say coming up in the next segment.
[01:27.400 --> 01:32.640]  Some of the news we have here, I saw this a couple days ago but I didn't get to it.
[01:32.640 --> 01:35.360]  I do want to cover it at least later in the next hour.
[01:35.360 --> 01:40.160]  This is out of the Nation magazine and it really mirrors the intel we've gotten about
[01:40.160 --> 01:42.200]  Blackwater and others.
[01:42.200 --> 01:46.800]  That's why Lieutenant Colonel Anthony Schaeffer's book, one of the reasons right now you notice
[01:46.800 --> 01:51.240]  the Pentagon is censoring it and not allowing it to come out right now because he's critical
[01:51.240 --> 01:53.120]  of these mercenary groups.
[01:53.120 --> 01:57.200]  But U.S. businessman Blackwater paid me to buy steroids and weapons on Black market for
[01:57.200 --> 01:59.040]  its soldiers.
[01:59.040 --> 02:04.520]  Reports on Baghdad parties with piles of cocaine, hashish, running around naked, shooting machine
[02:04.520 --> 02:09.040]  guns into people's houses for fun, just total bloodthirsty insanity.
[02:09.040 --> 02:13.920]  We've seen all these different mercenary videos of other groups just shooting families in
[02:13.920 --> 02:18.120]  their minivans in Iraq for fun and then our media tries to cover that up and throwing
[02:18.120 --> 02:23.880]  puppies off cliffs and the rest of it with a bunch of satanic music blaring in the background.
[02:23.880 --> 02:26.840]  So we're going to be discussing some of that coming up today.
[02:26.840 --> 02:32.440]  Obviously, I want to get into the economy and look at where globalism has taken us.
[02:32.440 --> 02:37.640]  What it's done to our society, the headline in the Wall Street Journal is credit unions
[02:37.640 --> 02:38.640]  bailed out.
[02:38.640 --> 02:42.280]  But when you actually read what happened, the feds are seizing a bunch of credit unions
[02:42.280 --> 02:44.800]  and feeding it into the big mega six banks.
[02:44.800 --> 02:48.880]  That's what this new Federal Reserve expansion of power earlier this year was really all
[02:48.880 --> 02:49.880]  about.
[02:49.880 --> 02:53.640]  Another one, regulator shutdown banks in Florida, Washington state.
[02:53.640 --> 02:55.760]  Czech president tells the UN to stay out of economics.
[02:55.760 --> 02:58.400]  We're going to be going over that.
[02:58.400 --> 03:04.840]  We're also going to get into small business banks, may spurn or refuse Obama's 30 billion
[03:04.840 --> 03:06.340]  program.
[03:06.340 --> 03:10.600]  That's because when you take any money from them, they get control of your institution.
[03:10.600 --> 03:16.640]  Think of America debt collectors called borrowers effing inwards and punk to get them to pick
[03:16.640 --> 03:20.120]  up the telephone in debt collection.
[03:20.120 --> 03:23.400]  Just incredible coming out from ABC News.
[03:23.400 --> 03:27.080]  Bernanke says economy recovering more slowly than policymakers would like.
[03:27.080 --> 03:31.920]  Well, last Monday, the feds said that we aren't in recession since 15 months ago that everything's
[03:31.920 --> 03:32.920]  fine.
[03:32.920 --> 03:36.820]  So I don't get the double speak from these guys.
[03:36.820 --> 03:42.480]  So Bloomberg, Obama stimulus made economic crisis worse, black swan author says.
[03:42.480 --> 03:47.480]  I want to go over this report from the economic collapse, 19 facts about the deindustrialization
[03:47.480 --> 03:49.600]  of America that will blow your mind.
[03:49.600 --> 03:53.320]  And also, Obamacare is even worse than critics thought.
[03:53.320 --> 03:59.760]  We're going to be going over that Obama healthcare imposes 3.8% tax on all income from home sales
[03:59.760 --> 04:04.440]  and home rental income, just one of the little nightmares rolled into one there.
[04:04.440 --> 04:08.400]  That's all coming up in the economics stack.
[04:08.400 --> 04:13.880]  Also the rats are jumping ship, getting off the sinking burning ship, Rahm Emanuel leading
[04:13.880 --> 04:17.240]  exodus of Obama aides from the White House.
[04:17.240 --> 04:20.880]  That's part of my question I've got for you coming up.
[04:20.880 --> 04:23.600]  I also want to get to the latest.
[04:23.600 --> 04:29.240]  We've now gotten a full list released by the Department of Homeland Security in Pennsylvania.
[04:29.240 --> 04:30.440]  In fact, I forgot to print that.
[04:30.440 --> 04:34.960]  You guys print Pennsylvania release full list of groups on terror list.
[04:34.960 --> 04:40.480]  It was in the Pittsburgh Post Gazette and some others, I forgot to give it to you, sorry.
[04:40.480 --> 04:43.760]  Israeli company running that spy grid.
[04:43.760 --> 04:47.520]  It's the treason and criminality only expands from there.
[04:47.520 --> 04:54.560]  More eugenesis, population reduction, news, big government documents coming out on that
[04:54.560 --> 04:56.920]  front and I ran a lot more.
[04:56.920 --> 04:59.720]  Stay with us in FullWars.com, PrismPlanet.tv.
[04:59.720 --> 05:01.280]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[05:01.280 --> 05:04.440]  Remember when I said you spell freedom, F-O-O-D?
[05:04.440 --> 05:05.440]  It's really true.
[05:05.440 --> 05:10.040]  Legislation is in the process of restricting the growing and sharing of food and a record
[05:10.040 --> 05:15.120]  number of Americans over 43 million depend on the government to feed themselves.
[05:15.120 --> 05:17.400]  Food prices are going up for Americans.
[05:17.400 --> 05:20.560]  Prices are going up even for eFoodsDirect.com.
[05:20.560 --> 05:24.000]  This will require their first price increase in three years.
[05:24.000 --> 05:28.240]  The most important thing Americans can do for their own freedom and survival in these
[05:28.240 --> 05:32.360]  hardest of times is to get supplies of high quality, storable food.
[05:32.360 --> 05:36.760]  Because of the huge response to this buy three and get one free special, eFoodsDirect.com
[05:36.760 --> 05:39.920]  will continue this special until September 27th.
[05:39.920 --> 05:44.480]  Right now you can buy three and get one free at the old prices, but move fast because this
[05:44.480 --> 05:46.400]  offer ends September 27th.

[05:53.000 --> 06:06.600]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show because there's
[06:06.600 --> 06:17.960]  a war on for your mind.
[06:17.960 --> 06:22.360]  We are live, ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much for joining us for the abbreviated
[06:22.360 --> 06:23.360]  Sunday broadcast.

[06:49.320 --> 06:51.320]  planet dot tv.
[06:51.320 --> 06:57.400]  Okay, we're going to get into the deteriorating economy and how it's been engineered by design
[06:57.400 --> 07:00.200]  in the words of the UN themselves.
[07:00.200 --> 07:07.680]  There's also more publicly released Rockefeller Foundation, UN, Club of Rome, Bellamillindigates
[07:07.680 --> 07:13.640]  Foundation documents where they admit conclusive global distribution of Rockefeller funded
[07:13.640 --> 07:18.600]  anti-fertility vaccine coordinated by the World Health Organization.
[07:18.600 --> 07:22.760]  And there's been a new facet of this discovered.
[07:22.760 --> 07:27.280]  We actually reported on this two years ago when this document was actually released by
[07:27.280 --> 07:32.880]  the National Security Council and the Pentagon, but I've got to be honest, it wasn't until
[07:32.880 --> 07:36.480]  Glenn Beck covered it this week that I went and re-read it.
[07:36.480 --> 07:44.000]  And it talks about intelligence report envisions designing humans with unique abilities under
[07:44.000 --> 07:51.300]  global governance regime, and it says the global government will design humans to basically
[07:51.300 --> 07:53.120]  serve the system.
[07:53.120 --> 07:57.440]  And you're already under that process of the brainwashing process to make you do whatever
[07:57.440 --> 08:02.280]  you're told so you can then be drugged and manipulated and then the government can decide
[08:02.280 --> 08:03.840]  who can have children.
[08:03.840 --> 08:11.240]  That's all in this strategic report up on info wars dot com and prison planet dot com global
[08:11.240 --> 08:18.240]  trends 2025 a transformed world national intelligence council office of the director
[08:18.240 --> 08:21.560]  of national intelligence United States of America.
[08:21.560 --> 08:27.360]  So everything we've covered on this show in the last 15 years is now coming out into
[08:27.360 --> 08:29.080]  the open.
[08:29.080 --> 08:37.280]  And the only question is does the public have the will and the courage to face this information?
[08:37.280 --> 08:43.600]  The food you eat the GMO crops on record designed to reduce fertility give you cancer on record.
[08:43.600 --> 08:49.800]  The vaccines designed to be used as basically binary weapons to reduce your IQ dumb you
[08:49.800 --> 08:55.840]  down filled with mercury cancer virus as you name it all on record.
[08:55.840 --> 09:02.280]  We're going to be discussing that coming up in the second hour.
[09:02.280 --> 09:09.280]  So later in the hour we're going to get into something that quite frankly dwarfs in my
[09:09.280 --> 09:14.960]  13 years in my 15 years of exposing things but I've been on air about two years.
[09:14.960 --> 09:22.160]  It was 1997 I've been on air about two years since then since 95 and law enforcement around
[09:22.160 --> 09:28.960]  the country would send me intelligence reports that they'd been given by the ADL Southern
[09:28.960 --> 09:34.520]  Poverty Law Center federal government the FBI the Justice Department and it would state
[09:34.520 --> 09:39.080]  that the real terror threat is the American people gun owners conservatives libertarians
[09:39.080 --> 09:43.680]  returning veterans the list goes on and on and it never really got attention when I
[09:43.680 --> 09:48.720]  would report on a few newspapers would pick up on it and we would be given these documents
[09:48.720 --> 09:52.360]  and then five years ago we got documents from preachers around the country.
[09:52.360 --> 09:57.400]  Now it's over 50,000 secretly hired by FEMA to tell their flocks to submit to government
[09:57.400 --> 10:01.960]  to turn their guns in of their told to to take inoculations of their told to let CPS
[10:01.960 --> 10:06.800]  take their children that finally made national news and I really think that it was just the
[10:06.800 --> 10:09.440]  American people weren't ready to admit this.
[10:09.440 --> 10:14.800]  They still trusted their government and also my radio show was not as big as it is now
[10:14.800 --> 10:20.240]  my news websites were not as powerful as they are now and it really you know never broke
[10:20.240 --> 10:26.080]  through the national stage until last February when we got the Mayak at Homeland Security
[10:26.080 --> 10:29.720]  reports remember it became a big national story for a couple weeks it was the biggest
[10:29.720 --> 10:35.880]  story in the country and the left was defending it yes returning veterans are bad and dangerous
[10:35.880 --> 10:41.320]  yes gun owners are bad yes Ron Paul is bad yes Bob Barr supporters are bad yes people
[10:41.320 --> 10:45.960]  that want to get us out of the UN are bad in fact I have an economist magazine article
[10:45.960 --> 10:49.480]  this week basically saying the same thing and we'll go over later if we have time but
[10:49.480 --> 11:00.320]  it's linked up on info wars dot com Kurt Nemo did a story about it and so so we finally
[11:00.320 --> 11:06.240]  broke through that psychological barrier where people were ready to face up to this information
[11:06.240 --> 11:13.520]  well since then more has come out since almost two years ago year and a half ago or so last
[11:13.520 --> 11:20.560]  February more has come out and it's in the Pittsburgh Tribune Review it's in the Pittsburgh
[11:20.560 --> 11:27.240]  Post Gazette it says lawsuit planted or protesters put on terror list Pennsylvania Homeland Security
[11:27.240 --> 11:36.160]  Employed Israeli government to suppress American political dissent you can't make this type
[11:36.160 --> 11:43.520]  of stuff up I mean it's illegal to have the feds or the state wiretapping gun groups in
[11:43.520 --> 11:49.680]  fact Friday we had a state representative on army veteran rated as one of the most conservative
[11:49.680 --> 12:00.840]  in his state we had him on the show and they're now getting the confirmed intel that their
[12:00.840 --> 12:08.600]  phones were tapped this is a mainline state representative who was having pro second amendment
[12:08.600 --> 12:14.760]  and anti tax increase rallies and the feds were watching them the state was watching
[12:14.760 --> 12:21.600]  them and the state paid $125,000 to an Israeli company to watch them I mean that's secret
[12:21.600 --> 12:28.480]  police and so later I do want to get into this in more detail because I saw a report
[12:28.480 --> 12:37.160]  over the weekend justice department report criticizes FBI spying on anti war groups
[12:37.160 --> 12:43.360]  and the justice department just like they just one of the deputy heads of the just departments
[12:43.360 --> 12:48.440]  gone public saying they were ordered not to investigate the black Panthers standing out
[12:48.440 --> 12:53.480]  front polling places saying you know kill whitey kill white people kill the white babies
[12:53.480 --> 12:59.720]  you you've seen the video on national news other videos of black Panthers with nightsticks
[12:59.720 --> 13:05.320]  basically threatening people outside polling places menacing people and they were told
[13:05.320 --> 13:10.760]  do not investigate that well now there's this report the justice department inspector general
[13:10.760 --> 13:15.840]  is issued a report critical of the FBI for its spying on anti-war activists animal rights
[13:15.840 --> 13:21.320]  groups and environmentalists the report entitled a review of the FBI's investigations of certain
[13:21.320 --> 13:26.680]  domestic advocacy groups said that terror investigations were unreasonable and inconsistent
[13:26.680 --> 13:31.680]  with FBI policy and I've seen several reports going back over a decade even when bush was
[13:31.680 --> 13:37.960]  in office I don't want an anti-war group having their rights violated I'm against these illegal
[13:37.960 --> 13:44.280]  wars unconstitutional wars preemptive wars I'm against these organizations having their
[13:44.280 --> 13:50.760]  rights violated they probably were my issue is what is the justice department doing putting
[13:50.760 --> 13:58.760]  out a report critical of the FBI investigating groups that at the bare minimum have a more
[13:58.760 --> 14:04.360]  violent history especially animal rights groups and environmental groups of sabotaging things
[14:04.360 --> 14:11.320]  burning down ski resorts I mean you know the long laundry list burning down car dealerships
[14:11.320 --> 14:18.720]  breaking into facilities but but the government saying leave them alone because those are
[14:18.720 --> 14:23.720]  groups that the federal government and big foundations are funding it's like when illegal
[14:23.720 --> 14:29.480]  aliens get so upset in San Francisco by citizens at the public school wearing American flag
[14:29.480 --> 14:34.760]  t-shirts the American flag wearing teenagers are sent home the illegal aliens win a big
[14:34.760 --> 14:39.640]  victory against free speech in the first amendment or when illegal aliens riot it's played down
[14:39.640 --> 14:44.560]  in the media when they pull down American flags at fire stations police stations post
[14:44.560 --> 14:51.000]  offices private businesses and run Mexican flags up that's okay don't investigate them
[14:51.000 --> 14:57.320]  don't list them as potential terrorist I mean if it's an outside group running around
[14:57.320 --> 15:04.320]  saying down with the US up with Oslo on up with Metcham that at least starts becoming
[15:04.320 --> 15:10.280]  seditious or revolutionary and I'm not saying violate their rights to do process but you've
[15:10.280 --> 15:18.320]  got clear evidence there of dangerous groups meanwhile the Justice Department saying leave
[15:18.320 --> 15:23.640]  all these people alone leave them all alone don't don't go to their meetings don't keep
[15:23.640 --> 15:29.680]  tabs on what they're doing no you need to watch gun owners conservatives libertarians
[15:29.680 --> 15:37.440]  patriots people that want to audit the Federal Reserve and now we have the Pittsburgh newspapers
[15:37.440 --> 15:41.440]  the Tribune and Post reporting on the list of these groups that they're spying on tea
[15:41.440 --> 15:49.320]  parties state representatives mainline gun groups the bottom line is this homeland security
[15:49.320 --> 15:56.120]  is for patriotic Americans it's built for us it's pointed at us and this didn't start
[15:56.120 --> 16:02.920]  under Obama okay this has always been the game Alex Jones here with urgent information

[20:23.760 --> 20:28.320]  okay i'm gonna open the phones up here in a moment and i don't normally follow the tried
[20:28.320 --> 20:35.920]  and trusted talk radio formula of seeing specifically i want to get your take on this question or
[20:35.920 --> 20:41.820]  that question what's your favorite color type stuff but i do occasionally throw out specific
[20:41.820 --> 20:47.080]  questions for listeners because i really want to get your view on it your idea it really
[20:47.080 --> 20:53.440]  helps stir the debate and the mental juices and so i'm gonna throw that question out and
[20:53.440 --> 20:58.240]  give you the number here in just a moment we're gonna take a lot of calls and the second half
[20:58.240 --> 21:05.040]  of this hour and for part of the next hour but just finishing up with pennsylvania it
[21:05.040 --> 21:12.560]  was just a few weeks ago that they tried to ban in ohio several main line libertarian
[21:12.560 --> 21:18.680]  and conservative groups having constitution day rallies they told them months ago no you're
[21:18.680 --> 21:23.080]  not allowed to do that we think you're basically hateful and evil and a federal court had to
[21:23.080 --> 21:29.520]  overturn that and who do you think is giving these reports though to the local governments
[21:29.520 --> 21:35.480]  they have all these seminars and meetings with the feds and with foreign groups that
[21:35.480 --> 21:41.680]  come in and brainwash the police brainwash our military and and and tell them oh people
[21:41.680 --> 21:46.440]  that don't like what the banks are doing the big central banks they're terrorist people
[21:46.440 --> 21:51.520]  that don't want to give up their guns they're terrorist oh this state representative darryl
[21:51.520 --> 21:58.280]  metcalf why you know he was on a secret terror database list and they were being surveilled
[21:58.280 --> 22:02.560]  and but the federal government and the state government couldn't get their own federal
[22:02.560 --> 22:08.960]  officers to break the law and spy on these people and so they hired a foreign israeli
[22:08.960 --> 22:15.000]  company to do it and that's now major news in pennsylvania but when you look at the national
[22:15.000 --> 22:20.440]  news it's nowhere so this is much bigger than the homeland security and mic reports of last
[22:20.440 --> 22:25.920]  year i mean these reports are saying these are potential terrorist they may attack and
[22:25.920 --> 22:31.440]  the reports went on to say oh when you protest taxes that could hurt the government see because
[22:31.440 --> 22:38.480]  the government has has its its policies separate from the people know we the people are the
[22:38.480 --> 22:44.080]  government in this country but shifting gears here's the question i want to throw out to
[22:44.080 --> 22:49.080]  the listeners we have a wonderful country the united states isn't perfect but it's been
[22:49.080 --> 22:54.800]  the freest most wealthy nation in history and it's proven that the free market the constitution
[22:54.800 --> 23:00.400]  below rights really works and we know both republican and democratic parties have been
[23:00.400 --> 23:06.840]  bought off in almost every level state and federal by big multinational corporations
[23:06.840 --> 23:12.720]  who get their profits basically off corporate welfare and we know that they're trying to
[23:12.720 --> 23:17.960]  pass laws to restrict family farms ranches industry in this country through the carbon
[23:17.960 --> 23:23.960]  taxes that they don't control and it's stated by them they want a post industrial us white
[23:23.960 --> 23:28.120]  house science are john p holdren talked about that two weeks ago he talked about again this
[23:28.120 --> 23:35.080]  week they don't hide that that's their policy and the democrats are all for it republicans
[23:35.080 --> 23:40.360]  are sometimes undecided you know they play both sides but you notice this agenda just
[23:40.360 --> 23:46.520]  continues to march forward so here's my question last week you saw john bainer the republican
[23:46.520 --> 23:51.240]  house leader and others get up not wearing their suits and ties and regular guys regular
[23:51.240 --> 23:56.800]  gals with their shirts rolled up in that p r stunt with their pledge to america kind
[23:56.800 --> 24:03.280]  of like the contract for america from 1994 with newt never saw a global carbon tax i
[24:03.280 --> 24:08.280]  didn't love genrich why republicans praise them i don't know why republicans like sports
[24:08.280 --> 24:12.320]  and a i don't know is because you're bamboozled or you feel like you're a winner because you
[24:12.320 --> 24:17.800]  support them and it's like democrats support clinton or obama it's like you live vicariously
[24:17.800 --> 24:24.280]  through them and you've got the winning team or whatever but but my question to you is
[24:24.280 --> 24:29.680]  we're seeing a major political realignment one of the biggest in our 230 plus year history
[24:29.680 --> 24:34.440]  we know the people are really waking up we know the polls show that republican candidates
[24:34.440 --> 24:39.340]  that are pro establishment or seen as establishment are losing in the primaries nine out of ten
[24:39.340 --> 24:44.920]  times or even more we know pro establishment democrats are losing in the primaries we know
[24:44.920 --> 24:51.720]  the democrats are set to lose the house maybe even the senate but will conservatives feel
[24:51.720 --> 24:56.720]  so good and like they've accomplished something when they take control of the house will conservative
[24:56.720 --> 25:04.600]  activists go back to sleep or will you continue to really talk about the real issues look five
[25:04.600 --> 25:13.000]  years ago it was off limits taboo prasada nongrata to talk about world government the council
[25:13.000 --> 25:18.720]  on foreign relations big central banks u n population reduction all the big neo con
[25:18.720 --> 25:23.240]  talk show host said it didn't exist you were a lunatic now we've come so far every night
[25:23.240 --> 25:26.680]  on fox news you can watch glenn back for an hour read government documents about how they
[25:26.680 --> 25:31.200]  want to set up a world government and kill 80% of us and like glenn's been saying here
[25:31.200 --> 25:35.560]  i'm just reading what they said i mean that's all i've ever done don't believe me go check
[25:35.560 --> 25:41.280]  out what i've reported here what i've shown you what we post links to at info wars dot
[25:41.280 --> 25:48.720]  com and present planet dot com so do you think we can save this republic i know we can have
[25:48.720 --> 25:53.880]  enough people realize the power they have to take action but if we're going to be bamboozled
[25:53.880 --> 25:58.600]  like the left was by obama bringing hope and change you know those things got worse and
[25:58.600 --> 26:04.600]  now the republicans get back in you know will they actually reverse all the major tax increases
[26:04.600 --> 26:11.000]  the expired bush tax cut will they shoot down carbon tax i remember just eight months ago
[26:11.000 --> 26:15.280]  right before the copenhagen tree here i guess now time flies 10 or 11 months ago man time
[26:15.280 --> 26:19.960]  flies back in november last year the most of republican leadership was saying yeah global
[26:19.960 --> 26:26.880]  warming is really better past the carbon tax it passed the house now they can't run far
[26:26.880 --> 26:33.480]  enough from it but before big special interest were coming in and paying them off just like
[26:33.480 --> 26:39.000]  democrats to go with these carbon taxes that are paid to set up the new imf world bank
[26:39.000 --> 26:44.480]  global currency called the band core it's now public no more denial and to allow the
[26:44.480 --> 26:49.840]  federal government to selectively decide who can have a factory who can have a business
[26:49.840 --> 26:58.320]  who gets selectively enforced on who gets left alone i mean that's the big enchilada
[26:58.320 --> 27:02.360]  for these type politicians that like to be basically politically bought off with campaign
[27:02.360 --> 27:08.040]  contributions is to be able like mafia dons in chicago or new york to decide who gets
[27:08.040 --> 27:14.880]  to have a business and who doesn't so my question to you is how do we ensure this awakening
[27:14.880 --> 27:21.000]  continues and doesn't get co-opted because the tea parties are great people but you've
[27:21.000 --> 27:27.600]  seen the rnc come in and take on the poll the tea parties political coloration of being
[27:27.600 --> 27:34.640]  constitutionalist anti-new world order anti-globalist you know strict national sovereignty advocates
[27:34.640 --> 27:43.560]  you've seen all that rhetoric but if i know history and i do i understand that the establishment
[27:43.560 --> 27:48.200]  controls us by controlling the left and right and whoever's out of power be it republican
[27:48.200 --> 27:53.960]  or democrat they play the part of anti-establishment and then when they get in power then they
[27:53.960 --> 28:01.480]  become establishment and the other party becomes anti-establishment so how do we continue this
[28:01.480 --> 28:07.160]  mass awakening how do we accelerate it and how do we keep republicans feet to the fire
[28:07.160 --> 28:17.720]  that's the question 8882012244 8882012244 first time callers i want to give you a chance
[28:17.720 --> 28:27.920]  to be able to get it on the phone lines 8882012244 specifically do you think there's been a major
[28:27.920 --> 28:33.520]  political realignment not with the general public we know that happened but with certain
[28:33.520 --> 28:39.760]  major power structures within our country or is it all a neocon put on when you watch
[28:39.760 --> 28:44.360]  these shows and hear these radio shows where they now kind of hold their nose and go okay
[28:44.360 --> 28:48.960]  there's a global government okay they do want to reduce your population okay the vaccines
[28:48.960 --> 28:57.720]  might not be so good okay that's the big issue 8882012244 we'll come back and talk about the
[28:57.720 --> 29:02.200]  rats leaving the sinking ship of the obama white house this is alex jones with five

[33:38.600 --> 33:48.760]  independent rama manual leading exodus of obama aids from white house the likely departure
[33:48.760 --> 33:54.040]  of white house chief of staff to become the new mob boss of chicago rama manual to run
[33:54.040 --> 33:59.400]  for mayor of chicago is part of a half term reshovel of top aids that will signal a new
[33:59.400 --> 34:05.960]  chapter in the history of barack obama's increasingly embattled presidency and he's got larry somers
[34:05.960 --> 34:11.040]  one of the main architects of the derivative scam with bill clinton 11 years ago that led
[34:11.040 --> 34:16.640]  to the tens of trillions of stolen dollars from taxpayers where they basically held the
[34:16.640 --> 34:21.560]  economy hostage and said we'll cause a total collapse not just a depression if you don't
[34:21.560 --> 34:26.160]  give us unlimited money and now they won't tell congress where the money went and republican
[34:26.160 --> 34:30.400]  leaders refused to hold their feet to the fire this is the type of treason I'm talking
[34:30.400 --> 34:35.640]  about and you don't hear the neocon republicans saying get the naked body scanners out of the
[34:35.640 --> 34:40.200]  airports you don't hear him talking about how homeland security is a tool used against
[34:40.200 --> 34:45.760]  patriots and libertarians and conservatives it's not enough to hear the talk show host
[34:45.760 --> 34:50.840]  now admitting world government's real they knew all along they're not stupid this goes
[34:50.840 --> 34:55.560]  back to bury goldwater he exposed the trilateral commission he was a u.s senator and how they
[34:55.560 --> 35:00.960]  openly wanted to set up world government read his book with no apologies everything
[35:00.960 --> 35:08.720]  he wrote 40 years ago has now come true unfortunately ronald reagan in 79 was speaking out against
[35:08.720 --> 35:15.240]  the new world order world government the trilateral commission and it's on record at the convention
[35:15.240 --> 35:19.240]  they made him take george herbert walker bush on is his running mate and told him no more
[35:19.240 --> 35:23.880]  world government or we don't care of your popular you're not going to get the nomination
[35:23.880 --> 35:31.960]  that's what we're talking about today we're back where we were 30 years ago again so you've
[35:31.960 --> 35:36.440]  got the rats leaving the sinking ship because they're latest fraud their latest establishment
[35:36.440 --> 35:42.240]  distraction obama has now been politically destroyed well i wouldn't be celebrating
[35:42.240 --> 35:45.600]  if i was you because he's just a frontman a puppet now they're going to bring you new
[35:45.600 --> 35:50.440]  puppets and then they'll blame them for everything that happens and it's just tasteful is berry
[35:50.440 --> 35:57.800]  sataro a.k.a. barack obama is as unto as is disgusting his treacherous activity is he's
[35:57.800 --> 36:02.320]  still just a frontman and i want to say something else i've heard national talk shows this week
[36:02.320 --> 36:07.040]  saying there's no truth to the birthers and no truth to obama and the evidence that he
[36:07.040 --> 36:11.840]  was born in kenya look there's a lot of evidence they're covering up what happened they won't
[36:11.840 --> 36:18.040]  release the real birth certificate but what i do know is 110 percent is this barack obama
[36:18.040 --> 36:25.600]  changed his name to berry sataro in indonesia and under federal law at that time if you
[36:25.600 --> 36:32.440]  changed your name and gave up your u.s. citizenship it made you ineligible to ever be president
[36:32.440 --> 36:39.680]  okay done but you hear nobody talk about that berry sataro he admits that was his name he's
[36:39.680 --> 36:44.400]  got another name this guy's got three names we know about meanwhile his aunts on national
[36:44.400 --> 36:48.840]  television saying i'm an illegal alien i get three welfare checks a month but you owe it
[36:48.840 --> 36:55.520]  to me all right i'm gonna shut up the point is the rats are leaving the sinking ship famed
[36:55.520 --> 37:02.840]  obama hope poster artist losing hope the guy that does all those obey t-shirts and the
[37:02.840 --> 37:07.200]  rest of it the artist whose poster barack obama became a rallying image during the hope and
[37:07.200 --> 37:11.880]  change election 2008 says he understands why so many people have lost faith an exclusive
[37:11.880 --> 37:17.600]  interview shepherd fairy expressed his disappointment with the president well what do you expect
[37:17.600 --> 37:22.440]  he's financed by the same people as the republican leadership by the way that hope and change
[37:22.440 --> 37:31.720]  poster was a 1940s style copy of posters used in the soviet union for linen and mal linen
[37:31.720 --> 37:39.160]  mal was used in china russia you name it joseph stalin it's disgusting they're telling you
[37:39.160 --> 37:43.200]  what they were gonna do i'm gonna shut up start going to your calls but my specific
[37:43.200 --> 37:48.160]  question if you just joined us is what's gonna happen when the republicans get in how do
[37:48.160 --> 37:53.080]  we hold their feet to the fire how do we force them now to cover more and more the real issues
[37:53.080 --> 37:57.680]  they've started to do it major groundbreaking things are happening world government is now
[37:57.680 --> 38:02.440]  being admitted world currencies being admitted the fact that the environmentalist leaders
[38:02.440 --> 38:08.720]  are a bunch of eugenicists would be population reducers a bunch of control freaks who literally
[38:08.720 --> 38:13.600]  want to collectivize everything that's finally coming out but is it just an election year
[38:13.600 --> 38:20.480]  stunt to sell the grassroots that's awake on voting for republicans will it take a real
[38:20.480 --> 38:27.040]  third party to stop this regardless we've got to move towards the states tent amendment
[38:27.040 --> 38:35.680]  nullification you get 60% turnouts and presidential runs 40% in off your elections federally 8%
[38:35.680 --> 38:41.920]  average locally we need 60% with the state elections and to take our states back that's
[38:41.920 --> 38:46.760]  how the founders designed it okay let's go to michael in florida michael welcome what's
[38:46.760 --> 38:54.640]  your view i agree basically i don't think that the republican party is gonna make any
[38:54.640 --> 39:02.760]  adjustments as far as progressing us in any way that we're gonna do do good you know the
[39:02.760 --> 39:07.960]  economy is bad right now and neither party is really going to do anything and it's just
[39:07.960 --> 39:17.280]  unfortunate well the republicans should have said zero zero increases in taxes zero you
[39:17.280 --> 39:23.320]  know allowing any of the bush tax cuts to expire but instead they've basically not put
[39:23.320 --> 39:29.480]  up enough of a fight in my view and allowed the tax cuts to expire the democrats have
[39:29.480 --> 39:35.520]  now basically punted and so those taxes are set to come back into force next year and it's
[39:35.520 --> 39:39.920]  going to be hard for a republican controlled house with a democrat controlled senate which
[39:39.920 --> 39:44.080]  it may end up being that way to reverse those and if you think our economy is dead right
[39:44.080 --> 39:50.800]  now wait till those tax cuts expire yeah that's that's that's very true those tax cuts actually
[39:50.800 --> 39:56.760]  might have helped but yeah it's what was it called the tax bomb it's about to explode
[39:56.760 --> 40:00.880]  it is it's about to explode with health care next hour i'm getting into the health care
[40:00.880 --> 40:06.880]  bill it was even worse than we thought now we see how obama plans to interpret and implement
[40:06.880 --> 40:12.800]  all that vague language death panels bill gates admits it says it's great it's all in there
[40:12.800 --> 40:19.120]  i appreciate your call michael howard and philly you're on the air okay i got this
[40:19.120 --> 40:24.040]  up from alex for one thing the rats are jumping the ship but they're jumping into dingy's
[40:24.040 --> 40:28.280]  and they're waiting to sit alongside the ship when the ships then forget about everything
[40:28.280 --> 40:32.920]  and start idling in the water again and they're going to jump right aboard republicans have
[40:32.920 --> 40:38.440]  told everybody the republicans are not going to repeat you anything forget the fact that
[40:38.440 --> 40:45.400]  obama has veto power even if they had the ability to have a veto proof bill they're
[40:45.400 --> 40:50.600]  going to you watch they're going to repeal nothing they're going to bluster they're
[40:50.600 --> 40:55.160]  going to tell everybody how it's too difficult and they can't do it in this environment it's
[40:55.160 --> 41:01.280]  not expedient if they start impeachment trials on obama and other members of administration
[41:01.280 --> 41:07.040]  they should be impeaching cast sunstein next week for openly issuing white house internal
[41:07.040 --> 41:13.480]  memorandum saying arrest people who don't believe in man-made global warming he calls for censoring
[41:13.480 --> 41:20.120]  the internet i mean this guy needs to teleport back to Stalinist russia i mean immediately

[41:26.920 --> 41:31.200]  for me i want to ask you a question before you let me go but i want to tell you something
[41:31.200 --> 41:36.920]  as well i was i've been in this movement as long as you've been uh woken up i was older
[41:36.920 --> 41:42.840]  than you when i was woken up by about ten years but we've been doing this for about
[41:42.840 --> 41:49.720]  the same length of time and i have watched as when bush got into office everybody disappeared
[41:49.720 --> 41:55.720]  into the woodwork and went and you couldn't find anybody i didn't i didn't know you didn't
[41:55.720 --> 42:01.040]  and i didn't but the most of the people around me no no they felt good exactly they said

[42:05.960 --> 42:10.440]  government let me ask you my question before you let me go because it's a it's a good
[42:10.440 --> 42:14.600]  one i've been googling it trying to see i can't find anybody that's put it together but i
[42:14.600 --> 42:19.240]  have been telling all my friends and everybody that i meet never to travel in the morning
[42:19.240 --> 42:23.080]  and they look at me and they say well why not and i vote my son and i just went to florida

[47:30.880 --> 47:34.440]  We've been running specials for about two weeks at a time.
[47:34.440 --> 47:36.840]  This special's got another week left.
[47:36.840 --> 47:43.280]  You can get my pivotal groundbreaking film that I think of my 26 films is the most powerful
[47:43.280 --> 47:46.720]  end game blueprint for global enslavement.
[47:46.720 --> 47:52.480]  If you want the full story in a near three hour film of the eugenicist, the globalist,
[47:52.480 --> 48:00.080]  the world population reduction plan, all the admissions of that, the Bilderberg group,
[48:00.080 --> 48:04.960]  the world government, it's in my film end game blueprint for global enslavement.
[48:04.960 --> 48:11.280]  And for another week, you can get four copies for 1995 for the price of one and then have
[48:11.280 --> 48:16.800]  one for yourself and give three away end game blueprint for global enslavement available

[48:23.640 --> 48:29.040]  Now I'm going to go back to Robert in a moment, but first I want to just quantify Howard, excuse
[48:29.040 --> 48:34.720]  me, what I call him, Robert, that's the next caller, sorry, there's so many there.
[48:34.720 --> 48:37.680]  Open the phones up for first time callers and get like 30 callers in.
[48:37.680 --> 48:39.320]  We have a computerized phone system.
[48:39.320 --> 48:44.200]  We can open it up for about a minute and 50, 60, 70 phone calls will come in and we just
[48:44.200 --> 48:45.200]  close it.
[48:45.200 --> 48:48.520]  But we're going to go back to your calls in a moment.
[48:48.520 --> 48:54.600]  But to quantify what I was saying earlier, because Howard made me think of this, this
[48:54.600 --> 48:59.400]  simple truth, remember under Bush, the Bill of Rights being bushered, the Constitution
[48:59.400 --> 49:05.240]  being butchered, all the socialism getting passed by any yardstick, by any measurement.
[49:05.240 --> 49:09.640]  Bush trying to reauthorize the assault weapons ban and I'd have conservatives send me threatening
[49:09.640 --> 49:16.040]  emails saying I was a liar, Bush wasn't supporting the assault weapons ban, or Bush wasn't supporting
[49:16.040 --> 49:20.280]  McCain Feingold that violated the First Amendment, you're living in denial.
[49:20.280 --> 49:22.440]  But why did they do it?
[49:22.440 --> 49:26.560]  Because they felt like they were winners and the way the media phrased it is Republicans
[49:26.560 --> 49:31.960]  were holding on to power from those evil communist liberals.
[49:31.960 --> 49:35.400]  Now we get the liberals in and it's a big wake up call.
[49:35.400 --> 49:38.280]  It almost be better if Obama stayed in for 10 years.
[49:38.280 --> 49:40.880]  Can you imagine we'd probably get this country back?
[49:40.880 --> 49:44.840]  But by the time America wakes up, they're going to give us a Republican who tells us
[49:44.840 --> 49:48.080]  what we want to hear and it's just going to continue.
[49:48.080 --> 49:52.280]  And then, oh, don't criticize what Mitt Romney or Sarah Palin's doing.
[49:52.280 --> 49:57.600]  You know, they're conservatives, you're a liberal.
[49:57.600 --> 49:59.000]  It's mindless.
[49:59.000 --> 50:00.920]  They all work for the same globalists.
[50:00.920 --> 50:03.760]  Now real fast, Howard, because I got to get to everybody here.
[50:03.760 --> 50:04.760]  Real fast, finish your story.
[50:04.760 --> 50:09.960]  You're saying you're a pilot, but you're going to fly at 7pm at night, not in the morning
[50:09.960 --> 50:14.160]  because you were saying during these false flag or staged events, go ahead.
[50:14.160 --> 50:17.720]  Every false flag event that I've ever seen, you tell me where I'm wrong, but I've been
[50:17.720 --> 50:18.720]  looking them up.
[50:18.720 --> 50:20.560]  They all happen early in the morning.
[50:20.560 --> 50:21.560]  You know why?
[50:21.560 --> 50:26.760]  Because the globalist stage them in the morning to take advantage of the news cycle.
[50:26.760 --> 50:27.760]  It's a full news day.
[50:27.760 --> 50:31.120]  And I've been telling people that, people said, well, why would that be?
[50:31.120 --> 50:35.560]  And this is my intro to tell people, I've actually gotten people to think and start
[50:35.560 --> 50:37.560]  looking these things up.
[50:37.560 --> 50:42.520]  I have an attack plan, I'm going to give it to you real fast, for the blaze, which
[50:42.520 --> 50:49.600]  I do like reading, but the commenters on the blaze are allowed to make their own names
[50:49.600 --> 50:50.600]  up for the comments.
[50:50.600 --> 51:00.400]  And I've been using big, long ones with like 50 letters in them, do another 9-1-1, investigate
[51:00.400 --> 51:01.400]  9-1-1.
[51:01.400 --> 51:04.880]  I've got all sorts of them set up, and you can make them as long as you want, and they're
[51:04.880 --> 51:06.040]  not blocking them out.
[51:06.040 --> 51:07.040]  They're not getting rid of them.
[51:07.040 --> 51:08.040]  I hear you.
[51:08.040 --> 51:09.040]  I appreciate your call.
[51:09.040 --> 51:10.520]  I appreciate your call, Howard.
[51:10.520 --> 51:15.880]  On message boards, on websites, it is key to use the comment areas, whether it's ABC
[51:15.880 --> 51:20.400]  News or Glenbeck's website, to put out real information.
[51:20.400 --> 51:24.440]  And notice, you're not hearing the conservative talk show host that now have discovered world
[51:24.440 --> 51:30.120]  government, and oh my goodness, it's all real after four years telling us it didn't exist
[51:30.120 --> 51:33.280]  when they knew full well it did.
[51:33.280 --> 51:39.520]  Notice that you're still hearing them go along with the official fable of these terror attacks,
[51:39.520 --> 51:43.640]  even though the Gulf of Tonkin's admitted to be fake, even though all these other government
[51:43.640 --> 51:49.600]  sponsored terror attacks have now come out to be just that, inside jobs, just like Oklahoma
[51:49.600 --> 51:54.040]  City, total inside job to blame the American people.
[51:54.040 --> 51:59.840]  But with 9-11, it's an inside job blamed on foreigners, but domestically, it's then used
[51:59.840 --> 52:01.760]  against the people.
[52:01.760 --> 52:03.320]  Let's talk to Robert in Texas.
[52:03.320 --> 52:04.320]  Robert, you're on the air.
[52:04.320 --> 52:06.320]  Hey, how are you doing, Alex?
[52:06.320 --> 52:07.320]  Good, buddy.
[52:07.320 --> 52:08.320]  What's on your mind?
[52:08.320 --> 52:14.320]  I just wanted to say thank you for opening up my eyes to all the concepts in which you
[52:14.320 --> 52:15.320]  hold.
[52:15.320 --> 52:21.480]  But as far as your question is concerned, I don't really think Republicans or Democrats
[52:21.480 --> 52:26.120]  for that matter are really going to make their change come November, and that's pretty much
[52:26.120 --> 52:28.200]  all I have to say about the whole deal.
[52:28.200 --> 52:29.760]  But I mean, quantify that.
[52:29.760 --> 52:34.360]  Why do you not think that you're going to see change from the Republicans?
[52:34.360 --> 52:38.680]  Well, because I've never trusted them before, and I don't trust them now.
[52:38.680 --> 52:40.960]  That's just my opinion.
[52:40.960 --> 52:45.920]  Well, my issue is some good Republicans like Rand Paul are probably going to get elected,
[52:45.920 --> 52:48.600]  and so we are moving in the right direction.
[52:48.600 --> 52:54.440]  But Rand Paul is as different as night and day for mainline Republicans like Newt Gennrich.
[52:54.440 --> 52:55.920]  I see.
[52:55.920 --> 52:57.680]  Well, I appreciate it.
[52:57.680 --> 52:59.480]  I'm not going to hold you up on the air by the callers.
[52:59.480 --> 53:00.800]  All right, Robert, good to hear from you.
[53:00.800 --> 53:02.520]  Scott in Arizona, you're on the air.
[53:02.520 --> 53:05.360]  Hey, thanks for checking the call, Alex.
[53:05.360 --> 53:12.720]  I want to answer the question at the same time, put one in that I told you that a request
[53:12.720 --> 53:18.280]  actually, and it personally ties in as to where I drive the camper from.
[53:18.280 --> 53:25.040]  Yeah, two emotions, pain and anger, and anger is typically a way to deal with pain.
[53:25.040 --> 53:28.480]  People do not make changes until the pain is great enough, period.
[53:28.480 --> 53:30.880]  Okay, that's how life works, period.
[53:30.880 --> 53:33.440]  People do not make changes as a whole.
[53:33.440 --> 53:40.480]  For that reason, unless those Republican getters still in there allow for the pain to continue
[53:40.480 --> 53:43.600]  to accumulate, there will not be the change.
[53:43.600 --> 53:47.000]  We take a situation like mine, and here comes the part of the request of it.
[53:47.000 --> 53:50.480]  I've heard you have on, I think we saw, Captain Austin Fitz.
[53:50.480 --> 53:57.320]  You've talked about the gentleman that did the busted video talking about CPS, okay?
[53:57.320 --> 53:59.960]  I have been in this for quite some time.
[53:59.960 --> 54:06.520]  However, this week, my efforts have just been ramped up, and the reason is because I had
[54:06.520 --> 54:09.280]  to go through the family court system.
[54:09.280 --> 54:13.880]  I am an awesome father, I'll toot my own horn, and a single one of that because of a pill
[54:13.880 --> 54:14.880]  pop in mother.
[54:14.880 --> 54:18.520]  But the point is, the family courts don't have due process.
[54:18.520 --> 54:24.040]  They were set up 100 years ago for eugenics, and they're designed to break up the family.
[54:24.040 --> 54:25.280]  So what happened?
[54:25.280 --> 54:30.960]  So, mother decided the day before the latest petition where I was looking for permanent
[54:30.960 --> 54:37.320]  sole legal custody again to make false sexual accusations about me and my daughter under
[54:37.320 --> 54:38.800]  absolutely no substation.
[54:38.800 --> 54:44.200]  At two o'clock in the morning, I've got a CPS agent who is too kitten to provide her
[54:44.200 --> 54:50.040]  last name, banging on my door saying with their egregious claims and their egregious
[54:50.040 --> 54:55.160]  threats growing and growing, you better let us in or you'll lose your kids forever.
[54:55.160 --> 55:00.800]  And my request is of you is what you can, where I can, or what I can get from you as
[55:00.800 --> 55:06.640]  far as beyond just searching info wars for resources to obtain knowledge, to continue
[55:06.640 --> 55:11.560]  on my battle against this, but also to become even more effective as a proponent against
[55:11.560 --> 55:12.560]  it.
[55:12.560 --> 55:17.440]  Well, Scott, Scott, the system trains everybody to make stuff up against each other.
[55:17.440 --> 55:21.200]  And you've just got to impeach her in the court.
[55:21.200 --> 55:26.320]  You've got to point out that it's not even a real court and you've got to point out
[55:26.320 --> 55:29.320]  that she never made these claims before.
[55:29.320 --> 55:32.240]  But we have a lot of guests, lawyers on about this.
[55:32.240 --> 55:35.040]  We discussed this at nauseam.
[55:35.040 --> 55:37.080]  It takes a long time to break these things down.
[55:37.080 --> 55:42.200]  I'd have to know the specifics of your case, but there's a standard operating procedure
[55:42.200 --> 55:47.000]  in this system, but you don't get the same due process or a real criminal investigation
[55:47.000 --> 55:53.320]  like you would with the real courts, it's done by a predatory CPS and they train these
[55:53.320 --> 55:55.680]  women and men to make stuff up.
[55:55.680 --> 55:58.720]  And then the, and then the child ends up going to the state.
[55:58.720 --> 56:00.240]  That's their end game plan.
[56:00.240 --> 56:02.200]  So the biggest issue is just to educate people.
[56:02.200 --> 56:04.280]  I appreciate your call.
[56:04.280 --> 56:07.840]  Let's go ahead and talk to a Stuart in California, Stuart, you got about a minute and a half.
[56:07.840 --> 56:08.840]  Go ahead.
[56:08.840 --> 56:09.840]  Hey, thanks, Alex.
[56:09.840 --> 56:11.840]  Yeah, I've never actually called in before.
[56:11.840 --> 56:14.200]  I hope you don't mind me using the call in line.
[56:14.200 --> 56:18.440]  I wanted to point out three things that I think are important to keep the baton from
[56:18.440 --> 56:24.120]  being passed back and forth from the Republicans to the Democrats with a new world order agenda.
[56:24.120 --> 56:29.760]  And that is what you've been doing primarily is exposing the tools and the, the root deception
[56:29.760 --> 56:33.880]  structure, you know, which are things like we're seeing now, something we talked about
[56:33.880 --> 56:34.880]  at Bilderberg.
[56:34.880 --> 56:39.960]  Oh, hey, you and I, we were fortunate to enter a phase of controlled admissions where they're
[56:39.960 --> 56:44.360]  actually like the Glenn Beck gambit, they're admitting certain things, but then they're
[56:44.360 --> 56:47.040]  steering away from the really important stuff.
[56:47.040 --> 56:49.800]  Second amendment issues, depleted uranium.
[56:49.800 --> 56:50.800]  That's right.
[56:50.800 --> 56:54.040]  They're now admitting, okay, there's a world government because the globalists are out
[56:54.040 --> 56:55.040]  in the open.
[56:55.040 --> 56:59.000]  We've now entered that phase and the Republicans are playing the part of the opposition to
[56:59.000 --> 57:01.760]  the world government so they can lead it.
[57:01.760 --> 57:06.520]  And we see them not really making, you know, real calls for things that would actually
[57:06.520 --> 57:10.800]  stop the U.S. from losing its sovereignty.
[57:10.800 --> 57:13.840]  This is a Stuart Howe, a 9-11 truth activist.
[57:13.840 --> 57:18.480]  I want to come back in the next segment, let him finish up.
[57:18.480 --> 57:24.360]  Then we're going to hurry through Michael, Womack, Tim, Sandy, James, Dave, and others.
[57:24.360 --> 57:28.000]  The toll-free number to join us, 888-201-2244.
[57:28.000 --> 57:34.720]  The question I've thrown out tonight is, what do you expect to come from the Republicans
[57:34.720 --> 57:36.360]  sweeping power?
[57:36.360 --> 57:37.840]  Will it be real change?
[57:37.840 --> 57:42.160]  I think it will be if we hold their feet to the fire.
[57:42.160 --> 57:46.640]  But the bottom line is this, we're making headway, we're making them face real issues.
[57:46.640 --> 57:52.080]  That's why they want to shut down the Internet, the alternative media.
[57:52.080 --> 57:56.360]  You've heard Alex explain how the Silver Lungs generator infuses the respiratory system with
[57:56.360 --> 58:00.960]  your self-produced colloidal silver solutions, yet many are unaware of the entire function
[58:00.960 --> 58:04.800]  of the Silver Lungs system and how it has been designed to deliver your silver solutions
[58:04.800 --> 58:07.480]  anywhere in or on the body.
[58:07.480 --> 58:12.240]  My name is Mario Safaldi and I'm the developer of the Silver Lungs generator.
[58:12.240 --> 58:16.840]  Not only does the Silver Lungs system produce endless colloidal and ionic silver solutions,
[58:16.840 --> 58:21.480]  it also comes equipped with the proper applicators and devices needed to deliver your silver
[58:21.480 --> 58:25.000]  solutions directly to key target areas.
[58:25.000 --> 58:31.760]  This includes the eyes, ears, nose, lungs, topically to the skin, and orally for the digestive
[58:31.760 --> 58:32.760]  system.
[58:32.760 --> 58:40.120]  Be sure to watch our new 7-minute video tour of the Silver Lungs system at www.silverlungs.com
[58:40.120 --> 58:43.240]  to learn more about how the Silver Lungs system works.

[58:50.760 --> 58:55.320]  Alex Jones here with urgent information concerning trendsresearch.com.
[58:55.320 --> 58:59.980]  The Trends Journal distills the voluminous ongoing research of the Trends Research Institute

[59:46.640 --> 59:52.160]  Subscribe to the Trends Journal, this information is too important to wait.
[59:52.160 --> 59:55.680]  Coast to coast, direct from Austin.
[59:55.680 --> 59:59.680]  We're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[01:00:26.680 --> 01:00:30.040]  world population eugenics angle.
[01:00:30.040 --> 01:00:34.600]  But I notice, especially Glenn Beck, when they do cover this, they show a bunch of mid-level
[01:00:34.600 --> 01:00:41.640]  professors and socialists and make it a left-wing thing, but that's only the left-wing arm of
[01:00:41.640 --> 01:00:43.780]  this system.
[01:00:43.780 --> 01:00:49.400]  But regardless, they're being forced to cover it, they're being forced to admit it's happening.
[01:00:49.400 --> 01:00:57.520]  But in the final equation, we know that the very same financial interests, the big megabanks,
[01:00:57.520 --> 01:01:02.040]  the huge corporations, to a group want world government.
[01:01:02.040 --> 01:01:05.600]  It's a global corporate empire, of course they want it, they built it.
[01:01:05.600 --> 01:01:08.160]  It's a hundred-plus-year plan.
[01:01:08.160 --> 01:01:12.680]  That's in their own reports, Carol Quigley and others, the United Nations, Rand Corporation,
[01:01:12.680 --> 01:01:15.440]  Council on Foreign Relations, Trilateral Commission.
[01:01:15.440 --> 01:01:20.280]  So they're not going to stop until we stop them, until we prosecute them.
[01:01:20.280 --> 01:01:23.680]  And this is an aggressive corporate military attack.
[01:01:23.680 --> 01:01:30.080]  But people always expect an attack to be military or from another government, so they're almost
[01:01:30.080 --> 01:01:39.520]  blind to corporate attacks by covert espionage and basic governmental infiltration.
[01:01:39.520 --> 01:01:45.120]  Now Stuart Howe, calling from California, great activist, recapped the point you're making
[01:01:45.120 --> 01:01:50.680]  because it's absolutely central, as we did say together at Bilderberg 2008, we were there
[01:01:50.680 --> 01:01:54.440]  to cover it, even if the mainstream media wouldn't, that Obama was there, that he was
[01:01:54.440 --> 01:01:58.360]  being chosen, that we knew where he really was, when the media said he was missing in
[01:01:58.360 --> 01:02:00.240]  action for a day.
[01:02:00.240 --> 01:02:05.760]  We documented that, and again, we let them call us kooks and nuts, we never shut up,
[01:02:05.760 --> 01:02:10.240]  we kept putting the truth out, and now we're shifting the entire paradigm.
[01:02:10.240 --> 01:02:15.280]  Yeah, absolutely, I mean, you can't have, as you know, you can't have an effective
[01:02:15.280 --> 01:02:17.840]  hoax unless it contains a lot of truth.
[01:02:17.840 --> 01:02:23.200]  So we're forcing them to include some truth in what they're doing, and we're seeing these
[01:02:23.200 --> 01:02:25.080]  controlled admissions.
[01:02:25.080 --> 01:02:29.680]  And what we're doing, I think, is we're continuing to take away their tools, and, you know, you've
[01:02:29.680 --> 01:02:35.040]  done such a great job in helping expose problem reaction solution and false flag terrorism,
[01:02:35.040 --> 01:02:43.520]  and I think maybe the next tool to take away is this continuity of agenda that we're seeing.
[01:02:43.520 --> 01:02:49.880]  We're seeing the agenda transcend one or another executive branch in and out of power, so if
[01:02:49.880 --> 01:02:56.000]  we can expose this continuity of agenda, it transcends both parties, and just kind of shine
[01:02:56.000 --> 01:03:01.480]  the light on the mechanism and the structure of their deception, they're going to keep
[01:03:01.480 --> 01:03:05.720]  losing tools, and they're going to keep getting more and more desperate, and that's going
[01:03:05.720 --> 01:03:10.080]  to chip their hand, and I mean, they're becoming obvious, I think it's kind of exciting.
[01:03:10.080 --> 01:03:15.120]  Stuart, I love the way you simplistically boil it down so well.
[01:03:15.120 --> 01:03:21.880]  There are controlled admissions, I'm going to use that term, and continuity of agenda,
[01:03:21.880 --> 01:03:28.680]  and we've talked a lot about that, but I always get into long-winded explanations, but it
[01:03:28.680 --> 01:03:36.080]  really is that fact that presidents come and go, Congresses come and go, but there's a continuity
[01:03:36.080 --> 01:03:42.440]  of the agenda, and you've got Republican and Democratic and corporate and academic and
[01:03:42.440 --> 01:03:48.600]  scientific leaders all in the CFR, Trilateral Commission, who then issue reports calling
[01:03:48.600 --> 01:03:54.320]  for global government, and what can only be properly labeled as tyranny, and then they
[01:03:54.320 --> 01:04:00.120]  repackage it as if it's just loving tyranny, and that is a continuity of agenda, and it's
[01:04:00.120 --> 01:04:06.000]  not just a continuity of agenda domestically here in the U.S., globally, they get naked
[01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:11.800]  body scanners in Germany and Japan, and Italy and England, we get them here.
[01:04:11.800 --> 01:04:17.720]  The police are trained the exact same way, it's a global corporate board, we see private
[01:04:17.720 --> 01:04:23.400]  snatch and grab squads, grabbing citizens, throwing them in vans to intimidate people
[01:04:23.400 --> 01:04:30.080]  at the G20 in England, Canada, and the U.S. It's a continuity, it's a corporate studied
[01:04:30.080 --> 01:04:33.600]  scientific worldwide dictatorship.
[01:04:33.600 --> 01:04:34.600]  Stuart, anything else?
[01:04:34.600 --> 01:04:35.600]  No, that's it, Alex.
[01:04:35.600 --> 01:04:39.200]  Thanks for all your great works, and thanks for having me on.
[01:04:39.200 --> 01:04:40.200]  Thank you, sir.
[01:04:40.200 --> 01:04:41.200]  Amazing.
[01:04:41.200 --> 01:04:48.800]  We ought to get Stuart Rhodes on in the very near future to get into all of that.
[01:04:48.800 --> 01:04:49.800]  He's a great guy.
[01:04:49.800 --> 01:04:52.280]  That's a We Are Change, Los Angeles area.
[01:04:52.280 --> 01:04:55.480]  All right, we're going to come back and try to get to a bunch of your calls ahead of a
[01:04:55.480 --> 01:05:00.080]  ton of other news coming up on The Economy.
[01:05:00.080 --> 01:05:04.720]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:05:04.720 --> 01:05:09.040]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:05:09.040 --> 01:05:13.360]  Number two, our new energies are, wants to control how much power your electric company
[01:05:13.360 --> 01:05:14.680]  allows you to have.
[01:05:14.680 --> 01:05:20.400]  It's true, total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:05:20.400 --> 01:05:24.720]  Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:05:24.720 --> 01:05:28.720]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:05:28.720 --> 01:05:32.200]  Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:05:32.200 --> 01:05:35.920]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related onages.
[01:05:35.920 --> 01:05:40.640]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[01:05:40.640 --> 01:05:44.440]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science,
[01:05:44.440 --> 01:05:45.840]  one of my old sponsors.
[01:05:45.840 --> 01:05:51.680]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com, that's mysolarbackup.com.
[01:05:51.680 --> 01:06:09.320]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[01:06:09.320 --> 01:06:16.320]  Reading a frontal assault on the lives of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones on the GCN
[01:06:16.320 --> 01:06:17.320]  Radio Network.
[01:06:17.320 --> 01:06:30.640]  We're going to continue with your calls and get into the economy.
[01:06:30.640 --> 01:06:36.760]  Also federal depositions, where we're learning more about black water, the reported cocaine
[01:06:36.760 --> 01:06:44.840]  parties, the running around naked, but most importantly, shooting up Iraqi homes and cars
[01:06:44.840 --> 01:06:46.400]  for fun.
[01:06:46.400 --> 01:06:56.680]  And there are countless videos online at YouTube, where you can see troops and mercenaries
[01:06:56.680 --> 01:07:00.240]  shooting people on the streets just for fun.
[01:07:00.240 --> 01:07:04.920]  And then every time you cover that, you're not patriotic, because Jack Bauer's a hero,
[01:07:04.920 --> 01:07:08.960]  torture school, and shooting carloads full of men, women, and children is the American
[01:07:08.960 --> 01:07:09.960]  thing to do.
[01:07:09.960 --> 01:07:12.280]  All heavy metal music plays in the background.
[01:07:12.280 --> 01:07:17.720]  No, this is how we lose our soul if we allow the globalists to turn our military and now
[01:07:17.720 --> 01:07:22.280]  mercenaries, who are actively training to take on the American people, I should add,
[01:07:22.280 --> 01:07:27.840]  that's Army Times, we lose our soul when we allow this.
[01:07:27.840 --> 01:07:33.120]  A 9-11 Truth Activist, who I know, Stuart Howell, called in earlier, and I was calling
[01:07:33.120 --> 01:07:38.720]  in Stuart Rhodes, another great steward of Oathkeepers, patriotic veterans and current
[01:07:38.720 --> 01:07:43.520]  military and police, who are saying, hey, I've sworn an oath to protect and defend the
[01:07:43.520 --> 01:07:47.600]  Bill of Rights and Constitution, and what the federal government is training police
[01:07:47.600 --> 01:07:53.880]  and military to do, isn't just unconstitutional, it's classical tyranny.
[01:07:53.880 --> 01:08:01.640]  Now, going back to what Stuart was talking about, he said, look at the controlled admissions
[01:08:01.640 --> 01:08:05.160]  we're seeing out of neocon talk show hosts now.
[01:08:05.160 --> 01:08:09.240]  After decades of trying to keep us in the dark, they knew full well what was going on,
[01:08:09.240 --> 01:08:13.320]  they knew full well what was happening, now they're going, okay, the global government's
[01:08:13.320 --> 01:08:19.200]  real because the BBC and AP and Time Magazine and Newsweek and New York Times, they're all
[01:08:19.200 --> 01:08:23.920]  coming out and saying, world government's good, it'll fix your problems.
[01:08:23.920 --> 01:08:27.920]  So they were kind of stuck in a weird position after decades of saying none of this existed.
[01:08:27.920 --> 01:08:32.640]  They're like, okay, it's bad, and it's run by Democrats, yeah, this little communist
[01:08:32.640 --> 01:08:36.600]  professor, he's the most dangerous man in the world, he runs everything.
[01:08:36.600 --> 01:08:40.920]  No, he's just one little minion of this system.
[01:08:40.920 --> 01:08:46.400]  When I start seeing neocon talk show hosts admit that powerful megabanks and powerful
[01:08:46.400 --> 01:08:52.280]  top corporations don't want free market, and that there's a hostile takeover of government
[01:08:52.280 --> 01:08:58.760]  by these corporations, and that we've got continuity of agenda from administration to
[01:08:58.760 --> 01:09:04.240]  administration, Republican, Democrat, with presidents and Congresses, then we'll know
[01:09:04.240 --> 01:09:07.840]  we've had a political realignment in the power structure.
[01:09:07.840 --> 01:09:12.360]  We've had a political awakening and realignment with the general public, but not with the
[01:09:12.360 --> 01:09:14.720]  power structure.
[01:09:14.720 --> 01:09:21.280]  They are in there stealing and robbing and looting and breaking laws seven ways to Sunday.
[01:09:21.280 --> 01:09:24.840]  Let's go ahead and talk to Michael in Florida.
[01:09:24.840 --> 01:09:27.120]  Michael, thanks for holding your on the air.
[01:09:27.120 --> 01:09:30.000]  Hey, buddy, you're on the air.
[01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:31.000]  Welcome.
[01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:32.000]  Alex.
[01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:37.480]  Hey, one thing that I was going to say is you come up with a lot of simple solutions,
[01:09:37.480 --> 01:09:43.680]  which every solution is simple, but they'd rather try 10 things that don't work before
[01:09:43.680 --> 01:09:46.000]  they try one thing that does.
[01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:51.200]  That's why you see technology advancing, but if you say let's end world hunger or something
[01:09:51.200 --> 01:09:54.480]  then they'll be like, oh, it can't be done.
[01:09:54.480 --> 01:09:59.680]  Well, their way to end world hunger is to pay our farmers not to produce.
[01:09:59.680 --> 01:10:04.400]  Their way to end world hunger is to have the Bellarm Linda Gates Foundation produce vaccines
[01:10:04.400 --> 01:10:06.080]  that sterilize you.
[01:10:06.080 --> 01:10:07.080]  That's their answer.
[01:10:07.080 --> 01:10:13.560]  Well, I'd like to tell all the puppets and the puppeteers, you know, I hate you.
[01:10:13.560 --> 01:10:16.000]  You're against me living.
[01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:20.560]  And when it comes down on the scale between me or you dying, I hope it's you.
[01:10:20.560 --> 01:10:25.360]  And I'll do anything as far as to defend anybody's liberty.
[01:10:25.360 --> 01:10:28.440]  If I see a cop beating up somebody, I'm not going to let that happen.
[01:10:28.440 --> 01:10:29.760]  And that's what needs to happen.
[01:10:29.760 --> 01:10:34.280]  A spirit of togetherness back in this country instead of division.
[01:10:34.280 --> 01:10:35.280]  Wow.
[01:10:35.280 --> 01:10:36.280]  That's an important point.
[01:10:36.280 --> 01:10:40.160]  We need to support the good police, but stand up against police that are being hired and
[01:10:40.160 --> 01:10:41.560]  trying to be thugs.
[01:10:41.560 --> 01:10:44.840]  I appreciate your call, Michael.
[01:10:44.840 --> 01:10:50.520]  Go back to Wall Street that came out 20 something years ago where they teach you greed as a
[01:10:50.520 --> 01:10:54.200]  good, cheating people is how you get ahead.
[01:10:54.200 --> 01:10:58.120]  And then the general public almost thinks it's cute in some cases.
[01:10:58.120 --> 01:11:01.840]  When somebody else is being cheated or manipulated, it's almost funny.
[01:11:01.840 --> 01:11:05.380]  Like you're at the Roman Coliseum laughing at somebody, you know, having their arms and
[01:11:05.380 --> 01:11:10.440]  legs chopped off by a gladiator because it's not you today that's being chopped up.
[01:11:10.440 --> 01:11:12.800]  So you feel like you're part of the structure.
[01:11:12.800 --> 01:11:16.220]  You feel like you're part of the power system.
[01:11:16.220 --> 01:11:18.240]  We need to start sticking up for each other.
[01:11:18.240 --> 01:11:22.360]  We need to start realizing when somebody else is having their rights abused.
[01:11:22.360 --> 01:11:25.240]  That affects us.
[01:11:25.240 --> 01:11:26.240]  That's common sense.
[01:11:26.240 --> 01:11:31.480]  I mean, how many reports have you seen in the news where in the U S or in Europe or
[01:11:31.480 --> 01:11:37.600]  other places, I mean, it's constant in a major city, somebody will be run over bleeding
[01:11:37.600 --> 01:11:39.080]  to death for an hour and a half.
[01:11:39.080 --> 01:11:42.200]  Nobody helps them or people will watch a young woman.
[01:11:42.200 --> 01:11:46.080]  There's been countless cases of this being beaten and raped in public and people will
[01:11:46.080 --> 01:11:50.880]  even come to their windows and their high rises and say, oh, look at this, it's entertainment.
[01:11:50.880 --> 01:11:54.400]  And that's because we've been desensitized by all the violence and things that are on
[01:11:54.400 --> 01:12:01.760]  television to not be able at a subconscious level to differentiate reality from fiction.
[01:12:01.760 --> 01:12:05.960]  And so we do have a lackadaisical, decadent, dumbed down public to a great extent.
[01:12:05.960 --> 01:12:07.640]  That doesn't mean everybody.
[01:12:07.640 --> 01:12:11.400]  And so the establishment said, hey, we got a bunch of chumps here.
[01:12:11.400 --> 01:12:13.500]  Let's rape them.
[01:12:13.500 --> 01:12:18.000]  And so things are going to get worse and worse because people don't stick together.
[01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:21.000]  It's weird to get upset about tyranny.
[01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:23.640]  It's weird to get upset about losing your freedoms.
[01:12:23.640 --> 01:12:28.160]  But if you paint yourself up like a clown and go get drunk and scream at a football game
[01:12:28.160 --> 01:12:30.680]  or a soccer game, oh, that's moral.
[01:12:30.680 --> 01:12:31.680]  That's good.
[01:12:31.680 --> 01:12:35.440]  You know, a lot of people in Austin aren't going to go to work tomorrow and are very
[01:12:35.440 --> 01:12:37.680]  depressed because UT got creamed.
[01:12:37.680 --> 01:12:40.400]  Oh, and it's very upsetting.
[01:12:40.400 --> 01:12:42.840]  And what are we going to do?
[01:12:42.840 --> 01:12:46.680]  Meanwhile, the economy is going into a full-bore depression.
[01:12:46.680 --> 01:12:50.880]  The government's accelerating programs of creating more debt that only make it worse.
[01:12:50.880 --> 01:12:54.920]  You try to tell some yuppie to get upset about that, and they go, you're some type of tenheaded
[01:12:54.920 --> 01:12:55.920]  weirdo.
[01:12:55.920 --> 01:12:59.240]  You're some type of lunatic who needs to be committed.
[01:12:59.240 --> 01:13:03.680]  You don't only care about football, man, I'm a real American.
[01:13:03.680 --> 01:13:08.120]  I don't know the Bill of Rights, but I know who, you know, the Dallas Cowboys quarterback
[01:13:08.120 --> 01:13:09.120]  is.
[01:13:09.120 --> 01:13:12.280]  Well, you know who the Dallas Cowboys quarterback is.
[01:13:12.280 --> 01:13:13.840]  You know who the Jets quarterback is.
[01:13:13.840 --> 01:13:18.240]  You know who the Vikings quarterback is, but you don't know what the Fourth Amendment is.
[01:13:18.240 --> 01:13:20.520]  And so get ready to be a slave.
[01:13:20.520 --> 01:13:21.920]  It's real simple.
[01:13:21.920 --> 01:13:27.720]  There are hardcore, abusive, very intelligent people that are using government to come in
[01:13:27.720 --> 01:13:30.800]  and tax you and give that money to corporations.
[01:13:30.800 --> 01:13:37.040]  And those mega corporations have built an army of dependent welfare queens and government
[01:13:37.040 --> 01:13:43.120]  bureaucrats who have been told if they want to keep their job, they got to squeeze you.
[01:13:43.120 --> 01:13:47.120]  And so the welfare queens are going to vote to take your guns so they get your check,
[01:13:47.120 --> 01:13:49.880]  and the cops are going to come take them to get their check.
[01:13:49.880 --> 01:13:56.400]  It's real simple, 51 plus percent of this country now is either on the government dole
[01:13:56.400 --> 01:14:00.680]  or gets a government contract, period.
[01:14:00.680 --> 01:14:01.680]  You go, well, that's my money.
[01:14:01.680 --> 01:14:02.680]  I paid into Social Security.
[01:14:02.680 --> 01:14:03.680]  Yeah.
[01:14:03.680 --> 01:14:04.680]  And it was all spent.
[01:14:04.680 --> 01:14:10.240]  There's not more of you invested it in a guaranteed private retirement.
[01:14:10.240 --> 01:14:14.800]  But now because you are tied into the government, you're going down with the ship and you think
[01:14:14.800 --> 01:14:15.800]  you're real smart.
[01:14:15.800 --> 01:14:16.800]  Okay.
[01:14:16.800 --> 01:14:17.800]  I'm ranting.
[01:14:17.800 --> 01:14:18.800]  I'm ranting.
[01:14:18.800 --> 01:14:22.680]  I don't have time to go to Walmart, do I?
[01:14:22.680 --> 01:14:23.680]  Walmart in Texas.
[01:14:23.680 --> 01:14:24.680]  You're on the air.
[01:14:24.680 --> 01:14:25.680]  Well, thank you, sir.
[01:14:25.680 --> 01:14:26.680]  I've had so many thoughts.
[01:14:26.680 --> 01:14:27.680]  Hit me once.
[01:14:27.680 --> 01:14:28.680]  I've almost lost them all.
[01:14:28.680 --> 01:14:33.280]  But the one thing I wanted to say is it's good to have a voice out there like you have
[01:14:33.280 --> 01:14:36.000]  this reaching so many folks.
[01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:42.400]  And I think if within 18 to 24 months, if there was a moratorium put in place right
[01:14:42.400 --> 01:14:47.480]  now, we put a tariff on all imports and exports.
[01:14:47.480 --> 01:14:56.160]  We established Glass-Steagall and then we restore our grain supplies with non-GMO crops.
[01:14:56.160 --> 01:14:59.600]  We can start to restore our leverage in the world.
[01:14:59.600 --> 01:15:02.280]  There are so many ideas.
[01:15:02.280 --> 01:15:03.280]  No, you're right.
[01:15:03.280 --> 01:15:10.040]  We've had top economists like Dr. Paul Craig Roberts on that would, look, China has tariffs
[01:15:10.040 --> 01:15:11.040]  on us.
[01:15:11.040 --> 01:15:12.040]  We don't own them.
[01:15:12.040 --> 01:15:14.280]  There's tax incentives to move to China.
[01:15:14.280 --> 01:15:17.880]  Why do you think zero cell phones are built in this country?
[01:15:17.880 --> 01:15:18.880]  Zero.
[01:15:18.880 --> 01:15:20.440]  Why do you think we've lost almost all our factories?
[01:15:20.440 --> 01:15:25.120]  I'm going to go over the numbers later because it was designed and now the White House admits
[01:15:25.120 --> 01:15:30.760]  they want a post-industrial country so you're bankrupt and under their control.
[01:15:30.760 --> 01:15:35.000]  And so the only jobs are government jobs or with corporations that get government contracts.
[01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:36.000]  Go ahead.
[01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:37.000]  Sorry.
[01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:38.000]  All I wanted to say is...
[01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:39.000]  No, you've got more to say.
[01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:40.000]  Stay there.
[01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:41.000]  I'm going to come back to Walmack.
[01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:43.000]  Then Tim, Sandy, James, Dave, Franklin and others.
[01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:47.160]  But when I'm done with this group of calls, then I'm getting into the economy, the police
[01:15:47.160 --> 01:15:52.560]  state, and the Blackwater and the reported cocaine parties running around naked and firing
[01:15:52.560 --> 01:15:53.560]  into Iraq.
[01:15:53.560 --> 01:15:54.560]  These homes.
[01:15:54.560 --> 01:15:56.200]  And if you're against it, you're of the devil.
[01:15:56.200 --> 01:16:01.200]  That's what new American boys do with the ride back.
[01:16:01.200 --> 01:16:02.200]  Hi, folks.
[01:16:02.200 --> 01:16:05.480]  This is Alex Jones asking you for a minute of your time to tell you about soap.
[01:16:05.480 --> 01:16:10.080]  Not detergents, but good old-fashioned pure soap made by the Calvin Soap Company, a family-owned
[01:16:10.080 --> 01:16:11.760]  and operated American company.
[01:16:11.760 --> 01:16:16.560]  My family, staff, friends, and radio listeners are constantly telling me how much they love
[01:16:16.560 --> 01:16:19.200]  these products for bath, air, laundry, and dishes.
[01:16:19.200 --> 01:16:23.200]  There is nothing like these factory direct, big-money-saving triple-concentrated subs

[01:16:36.880 --> 01:16:43.600]  As founder and owner for over 63 years, people keep asking me, how's business?
[01:16:43.600 --> 01:16:47.680]  I'm happy to say our business is going down the drain.

[01:17:59.560 --> 01:18:02.200]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:18:02.200 --> 01:18:05.360]  Remember when I said you spell freedom, F-O-O-D?
[01:18:05.360 --> 01:18:06.360]  It's really true.
[01:18:06.360 --> 01:18:10.960]  Legislation is in the process of restricting the growing and sharing of food, and a record
[01:18:10.960 --> 01:18:16.040]  number of Americans over 43 million depend on the government to feed themselves.
[01:18:16.040 --> 01:18:18.320]  Food prices are going up for Americans.
[01:18:18.320 --> 01:18:21.480]  Prices are going up, even for eFoodsDirect.com.
[01:18:21.480 --> 01:18:24.960]  This will require their first price increase in three years.
[01:18:24.960 --> 01:18:29.160]  The most important thing Americans can do for their own freedom and survival in these
[01:18:29.160 --> 01:18:33.280]  hardest of times is to get supplies of high-quality, storeable food.
[01:18:33.280 --> 01:18:38.240]  Because of the huge response to this buy-three-and-get-one-free special, eFoodsDirect.com will continue
[01:18:38.240 --> 01:18:40.840]  this special until September 27th.

[01:19:07.760 --> 01:19:12.760]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[01:19:12.760 --> 01:19:21.520]  There's a place down in Tennessee where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.

[01:19:29.920 --> 01:19:34.680]  They put a diamond gusset in the crotch where you need it most.

[01:19:39.720 --> 01:19:46.520]  We turn jeans inside out, diamond gusset jeans, made in the USA with unparalleled quality.

[01:19:56.160 --> 01:20:02.120]  Diamond gusset jeans got it, others don't.

[01:20:05.800 --> 01:20:09.800]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[01:20:09.800 --> 01:20:17.000]  Okay, let's go back to Wal-Mac in Texas.
[01:20:17.000 --> 01:20:18.520]  Wal-Mac, finish up your point.
[01:20:18.520 --> 01:20:24.000]  Well, I just don't think we're tap it into the creativity of the individual people out
[01:20:24.000 --> 01:20:25.800]  here in the country.
[01:20:25.800 --> 01:20:30.440]  Everybody's being scooped into this Baskin Robbins 31-flavored type scoop where you can
[01:20:30.440 --> 01:20:37.240]  mix and match, but we really need to start tapping into the individuality of everyone.
[01:20:37.240 --> 01:20:42.200]  And I really think that's the verge, that's the major breakthrough that we're coming from.
[01:20:42.200 --> 01:20:47.200]  Yeah, I've had a few beers, but you never know, you access different things in the brain.
[01:20:47.200 --> 01:20:49.360]  How many beers have you had, Wal-Mac?
[01:20:49.360 --> 01:20:55.880]  Well, since I'm sitting still and, well, I've had about four.
[01:20:55.880 --> 01:20:58.520]  Well, that's okay, because so have I.
[01:20:58.520 --> 01:20:59.520]  I appreciate your call.
[01:20:59.520 --> 01:21:00.520]  I'm a small man.
[01:21:00.520 --> 01:21:01.520]  I'm just joking.
[01:21:01.520 --> 01:21:02.520]  Hey, I'm a small man, man.
[01:21:02.520 --> 01:21:03.520]  I'm five to two.
[01:21:03.520 --> 01:21:04.520]  I'm 120 pounds.
[01:21:04.520 --> 01:21:05.520]  I don't know what.
[01:21:05.520 --> 01:21:06.520]  You know.
[01:21:06.520 --> 01:21:07.520]  Wal-Mac, I appreciate your call.
[01:21:07.520 --> 01:21:08.520]  I was joking, folks.
[01:21:08.520 --> 01:21:10.160]  I haven't had any beer.
[01:21:10.160 --> 01:21:11.560]  Let's talk to Tim in Illinois.
[01:21:11.560 --> 01:21:12.560]  Tim, you're on the air.
[01:21:12.560 --> 01:21:13.560]  Go ahead.
[01:21:13.560 --> 01:21:14.560]  Hey, man.
[01:21:14.560 --> 01:21:20.320]  I just, in my opinion, I think everything, most of the problems in this country is stemmed
[01:21:20.320 --> 01:21:23.400]  from the money, follow the money.
[01:21:23.400 --> 01:21:25.640]  That's the line, right?
[01:21:25.640 --> 01:21:29.640]  I think everybody should be educated, because I talked to so many people that don't understand
[01:21:29.640 --> 01:21:31.640]  that the federal reserve isn't even part of the federal government.
[01:21:31.640 --> 01:21:32.640]  No.
[01:21:32.640 --> 01:21:36.400]  I mean, Americans don't have the basic facts about who runs their government.
[01:21:36.400 --> 01:21:41.520]  And we're praising neocons for finally admitting a little bit of it when they've been part
[01:21:41.520 --> 01:21:42.760]  of the same system.
[01:21:42.760 --> 01:21:47.040]  But I'm praising it because it shows how far we've come.
[01:21:47.040 --> 01:21:50.720]  But the globalists have engineered every facet of our lives.
[01:21:50.720 --> 01:21:55.720]  I think people should know who's making decisions for them.
[01:21:55.720 --> 01:21:59.720]  If you support anybody that supports the federal reserve, they're going to get rid of them.
[01:21:59.720 --> 01:22:02.720]  And that's one way, you know, these people that come in and say, oh, we're going to do
[01:22:02.720 --> 01:22:03.720]  this and do that.
[01:22:03.720 --> 01:22:07.720]  Well, just like Ron Paul, get rid of the federal reserve, or at least start looking at it.
[01:22:07.720 --> 01:22:08.720]  Exactly.
[01:22:08.720 --> 01:22:12.560]  Because if you don't get rid of the federal reserve, you're not dealing with the private
[01:22:12.560 --> 01:22:16.720]  corporate fascist government that hijacked us 97 years ago.
[01:22:16.720 --> 01:22:21.720]  Look how difficult it is, I think Kennedy tried to do it, and look what happened to
[01:22:21.720 --> 01:22:22.720]  him.
[01:22:22.720 --> 01:22:24.360]  Yeah, but they can kill an individual.
[01:22:24.360 --> 01:22:25.520]  They can't kill an idea.
[01:22:25.520 --> 01:22:26.520]  I appreciate your call.
[01:22:26.520 --> 01:22:27.520]  Great points, Tim.
[01:22:27.520 --> 01:22:29.720]  Sandy in Illinois, you're on the air.
[01:22:29.720 --> 01:22:30.720]  Hi.
[01:22:30.720 --> 01:22:31.720]  Hi, Alex.
[01:22:31.720 --> 01:22:32.720]  Hey.
[01:22:32.720 --> 01:22:37.840]  I just, okay, I'm on my cell phones, I'm hard time hearing here.
[01:22:37.840 --> 01:22:43.000]  I've only listened to you for about six weeks, and I'm a totally changed person, a former
[01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:44.000]  liberal.
[01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:50.600]  After the golf spill, I finally got it, and thank you so much, but I wanted to mention
[01:22:50.600 --> 01:22:52.400]  one thing about anger.
[01:22:52.400 --> 01:22:54.040]  I'm a teacher, a former teacher.
[01:22:54.040 --> 01:22:59.200]  I don't teach anymore because it's a nightmare in schools nowadays, but you can't get angry
[01:22:59.200 --> 01:23:00.200]  anymore.
[01:23:00.200 --> 01:23:06.000]  And if you get angry, you're mean, and you can't tell the truth because you're mean,
[01:23:06.000 --> 01:23:10.240]  and I laughed when you said that the only time you get angry is at a sports game, and
[01:23:10.240 --> 01:23:12.720]  I find that absolutely ridiculous.
[01:23:12.720 --> 01:23:18.120]  Yeah, they give us these little areas where we can act like human beings and get angry.
[01:23:18.120 --> 01:23:22.520]  We get angry for a reason, and they've trained parents not to discipline their children,
[01:23:22.520 --> 01:23:26.480]  and now many children act like animals, and then they tell the teachers they can't stand
[01:23:26.480 --> 01:23:31.440]  up to the out-of-control kids, and so the answer is bring police in and turn the school
[01:23:31.440 --> 01:23:32.840]  into a prison.
[01:23:32.840 --> 01:23:39.160]  Well, it's run by thugs, you know, our school district, I won't say the name.
[01:23:39.160 --> 01:23:43.800]  We allow thugs to be in the school and run them, and we don't get rid of them because
[01:23:43.800 --> 01:23:49.320]  then they'll lose federal government and our money, and our superintendent allows this,
[01:23:49.320 --> 01:23:52.800]  and so children that are in the middle are quitting school.
[01:23:52.800 --> 01:23:56.880]  It's not the thugs that are quitting because they run the schools now, and I was so good,
[01:23:56.880 --> 01:23:57.880]  I was disgusted.
[01:23:57.880 --> 01:24:02.000]  Well, I went to school in Dallas, and I don't plan to be the toughest guy in the world,
[01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:08.360]  but I am a lot tougher than I would have been because starting in about sixth grade, I was
[01:24:08.360 --> 01:24:12.240]  in private school until sixth grade, while I was in public school and kindergarten first,
[01:24:12.240 --> 01:24:16.400]  and then for four years I was in private school, and then they put me in public school, and
[01:24:16.400 --> 01:24:21.960]  I got off the bus when I was in sixth grade and a kid with a mustache, you know, probably
[01:24:21.960 --> 01:24:26.320]  flunked four grades, was beating me up, and I'd come home with black eyes and my dad would
[01:24:26.320 --> 01:24:30.080]  say, well, you better get tough, and that was the old-fashioned view, and then I started
[01:24:30.080 --> 01:24:37.480]  getting tough, and then I would beat somebody up who attacked me, but the problem was I'd
[01:24:37.480 --> 01:24:41.680]  not hurt them, and then I would get in trouble because I defended myself.
[01:24:41.680 --> 01:24:42.960]  Did you see that in school?
[01:24:42.960 --> 01:24:45.640]  Oh, absolutely, and so that's why I left.
[01:24:45.640 --> 01:24:51.640]  I just, luckily, I hate to say it, because you were just bashing Social Security, but
[01:24:51.640 --> 01:24:56.200]  luckily I was able to leave, and I'll be able to collect Social Security because my ex-husband
[01:24:56.200 --> 01:24:57.200]  passed away.
[01:24:57.200 --> 01:24:58.640]  Alex, I can't get a job.
[01:24:58.640 --> 01:25:00.200]  When you're 60, you can't get a job.
[01:25:00.200 --> 01:25:02.400]  Sandy, Sandy, that's your money.
[01:25:02.400 --> 01:25:05.000]  I wasn't bashing Social Security.
[01:25:05.000 --> 01:25:10.960]  If the government would have actually invested it in guaranteed returns, 3, 4, 5%, you would
[01:25:10.960 --> 01:25:12.040]  have your money.
[01:25:12.040 --> 01:25:17.400]  The problem is the big megabanks took that money and stole it and, you know, bought more
[01:25:17.400 --> 01:25:21.280]  fleets of LearJets, and so now they've got us dependent on them.
[01:25:21.280 --> 01:25:26.960]  I wasn't bashing, you know, anybody, I mean, I've got a grandmother who's on Social Security,
[01:25:26.960 --> 01:25:30.160]  and I give her a little bit of money every month because it just doesn't pay for what
[01:25:30.160 --> 01:25:35.320]  it did before because of inflation, I'm not saying you're bad because you're retired
[01:25:35.320 --> 01:25:36.920]  on Social Security.
[01:25:36.920 --> 01:25:39.040]  That's money you paid for that.
[01:25:39.040 --> 01:25:44.480]  The problem is crooks stole it so it's not there, and so now they're going to say, give
[01:25:44.480 --> 01:25:49.480]  us whatever else we want with banker bailouts, let banks take over the whole economy, or
[01:25:49.480 --> 01:25:55.920]  we won't give Sandy her Social Security so they can control you basically as their slave.
[01:25:55.920 --> 01:25:58.200]  And I hate it because I'd rather be teaching.
[01:25:58.200 --> 01:25:59.200]  I love teaching.
[01:25:59.200 --> 01:26:04.600]  I would rather teach, and I would like to teach the kids that need help, but it's impossible
[01:26:04.600 --> 01:26:05.600]  to do it in this district.
[01:26:05.600 --> 01:26:06.600]  It's absolutely impossible.
[01:26:06.600 --> 01:26:10.480]  And I wanted to say a couple other things because your question was about what we can
[01:26:10.480 --> 01:26:14.640]  do and what's going to happen, and there were three points I wanted to make.
[01:26:14.640 --> 01:26:19.320]  First of all, holding the politicians speak to the fire, and that is Republicans and Democrats
[01:26:19.320 --> 01:26:25.120]  because I don't have much hope in the Republicans either, but this S510 that I know you've mentioned
[01:26:25.120 --> 01:26:31.720]  before, and it's S3767, the so-called Food Safety Act, and the Supplement One, we have
[01:26:31.720 --> 01:26:37.480]  kept their feet to the fire, and one of my Senators, Durbin, has been on this for over
[01:26:37.480 --> 01:26:38.480]  10 years, Alex.
[01:26:38.480 --> 01:26:44.720]  He's been trying to get this passed, and using this kid that died in Lincoln as an excuse
[01:26:44.720 --> 01:26:46.680]  to pull a Feddler, which has nothing to do with that.
[01:26:46.680 --> 01:26:51.160]  And for those that don't know, that was big mega producers that had the bad eggs and things.
[01:26:51.160 --> 01:26:55.680]  They want to literally not let you pick peaches and sell them on the side of the road.
[01:26:55.680 --> 01:27:02.520]  This thing was written by big agribusiness to shut, I mean, the FDA admits that they
[01:27:02.520 --> 01:27:04.600]  want to shut down family farms.
[01:27:04.600 --> 01:27:07.680]  They're on record saying, get big or get out.
[01:27:07.680 --> 01:27:09.120]  They want mega agribusiness.
[01:27:09.120 --> 01:27:14.640]  They do, and I live in a farming state, and these little farmers around here, I mean,
[01:27:14.640 --> 01:27:17.760]  we're hoping, you know, next time Durbin runs, he's going to be out if he doesn't knock
[01:27:17.760 --> 01:27:18.760]  it off.
[01:27:18.760 --> 01:27:21.960]  He's been on this for over 10 years trying to get this passed.
[01:27:21.960 --> 01:27:25.920]  But the second thing, too, I wanted to say, Alex, too, as a teacher, I saw this, and I
[01:27:25.920 --> 01:27:28.240]  see it all the time on Facebook and stuff.
[01:27:28.240 --> 01:27:34.240]  This racist card, I'm getting so tired of everybody playing the racist card on everything.
[01:27:34.240 --> 01:27:36.920]  You're racist if you're against the Japanese killing whales.
[01:27:36.920 --> 01:27:42.920]  You're racist if you're not for Jesse Jackson, and I am so tired of it, and they use that
[01:27:42.920 --> 01:27:45.640]  against us, and the Muslims, and we all need to get together.
[01:27:45.640 --> 01:27:51.800]  They admit they do, it's a political weapon because Americans are good people that have
[01:27:51.800 --> 01:27:56.720]  a lot of hospitality, so all these special interest groups in government, they use it.
[01:27:56.720 --> 01:27:59.200]  Oh, you don't want government health care, you're a racist.
[01:27:59.200 --> 01:28:01.980]  You don't want to give up your rights, you're a racist.
[01:28:01.980 --> 01:28:04.080]  You don't want to turn your guns in, you're a racist.
[01:28:04.080 --> 01:28:06.180]  It doesn't work anymore, though, Sandy.
[01:28:06.180 --> 01:28:07.680]  That's the good news.
[01:28:07.680 --> 01:28:10.640]  Americans, whether they're black or white, it doesn't matter, are really starting to
[01:28:10.640 --> 01:28:11.640]  see through this.
[01:28:11.640 --> 01:28:12.640]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:28:12.640 --> 01:28:17.320]  And one more point I wanted to make, because I am a teacher, Alex, we really, and you've
[01:28:17.320 --> 01:28:21.240]  been so good at doing this, and I know a lot of young people listen to you.
[01:28:21.240 --> 01:28:23.200]  We really have to educate our young people.
[01:28:23.200 --> 01:28:25.040]  You know, they're not being taught history.
[01:28:25.040 --> 01:28:32.760]  Since the Bush, no child left behind, history's just been kind of shoved to file 13, and children
[01:28:32.760 --> 01:28:38.240]  are being told now the new racist thing is, our founding fathers were racist.
[01:28:38.240 --> 01:28:39.240]  That's what they're...
[01:28:39.240 --> 01:28:42.720]  Oh, I know, I know, in fact, that's in the Economist magazine.
[01:28:42.720 --> 01:28:46.680]  We got to get rid of this bill of rights, because racist are for it.
[01:28:46.680 --> 01:28:48.840]  In fact, let me comment on that when we come back.
[01:28:48.840 --> 01:28:50.480]  Sandy, I appreciate your call.
[01:28:50.480 --> 01:28:53.200]  I'm going to cover a bunch of news when we come back, then I'm going to get to the rest
[01:28:53.200 --> 01:29:21.200]  of your calls before this abbreviated Sunday Transmission Ends, infowars.com.
[01:29:21.200 --> 01:29:29.800]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:29:29.800 --> 01:29:33.320]  Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:29:33.320 --> 01:29:37.040]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related onages.
[01:29:37.040 --> 01:29:41.640]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[01:29:41.640 --> 01:29:45.560]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science,
[01:29:45.560 --> 01:29:46.960]  one of my old sponsors.
[01:29:46.960 --> 01:29:52.920]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com, that's mysolarbackup.com.

[01:30:06.120 --> 01:30:10.400]  This is an American-made product of the highest quality and compares to nothing you will find
[01:30:10.400 --> 01:30:11.400]  in stores.

[01:30:30.120 --> 01:30:31.560]  gentle on the environment.

[01:30:59.200 --> 01:31:00.200]  Thank you.
[01:31:00.200 --> 01:31:01.960]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:31:01.960 --> 01:31:05.360]  Remember when I said you spell freedom, F-O-O-D?
[01:31:05.360 --> 01:31:06.360]  It's really true.
[01:31:06.360 --> 01:31:10.960]  Legislation is in the process of restricting the growing and sharing of food and a record
[01:31:10.960 --> 01:31:16.040]  number of Americans over 43 million depend on the government to feed themselves.
[01:31:16.040 --> 01:31:18.320]  Food prices are going up for Americans.
[01:31:18.320 --> 01:31:21.480]  Prices are going up even for eFoodsDirect.com.
[01:31:21.480 --> 01:31:24.960]  This will require their first price increase in three years.
[01:31:24.960 --> 01:31:29.160]  The most important thing Americans can do for their own freedom and survival in these
[01:31:29.160 --> 01:31:33.320]  hardest of times is to get supplies of high quality, storable food.
[01:31:33.320 --> 01:31:37.680]  Because of the huge response to this buy three and get one free special, eFoodsDirect.com
[01:31:37.680 --> 01:31:40.840]  will continue this special until September 27th.
[01:31:40.840 --> 01:31:45.440]  Right now you can buy three and get one free at the old prices, but move fast because this
[01:31:45.440 --> 01:31:47.400]  offer ends September 27th.
[01:31:47.400 --> 01:31:53.920]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or on the web at eFoodsDirect.com forward slash Alex.
[01:31:53.920 --> 01:32:00.560]  That's 800-409-5633 or on the web at eFoodsDirect.com forward slash Alex.
[01:32:00.560 --> 01:32:04.920]  Alex Jones here with urgent information concerning trendsresearch.com.
[01:32:04.920 --> 01:32:09.560]  The Trends Journal distills the voluminous ongoing research of the Trends Research Institute
[01:32:09.560 --> 01:32:12.400]  into a concise, readily accessible form.

[01:32:57.520 --> 01:33:02.120]  This information is too important to wait.
[01:33:02.120 --> 01:33:05.840]  Coast to coast, direct from Austin.
[01:33:05.840 --> 01:33:09.800]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[01:33:09.800 --> 01:33:20.720]  Okay, my friends, again thank you for joining us on the Sunday Transmission back tomorrow
[01:33:20.720 --> 01:33:21.720]  11 a.m. Central.
[01:33:21.720 --> 01:33:26.080]  If you don't have an AMNF in your area, you can always listen at infowars.com, but if
[01:33:26.080 --> 01:33:30.600]  you are listening on an AM or FM, please spread the word to all your co-workers, your neighbors,
[01:33:30.600 --> 01:33:35.360]  your friends, your family, people at gas stations, you name it, how they can tune in, whether
[01:33:35.360 --> 01:33:41.600]  it's infowars.com or a great station like 590 a.m. here in Austin, Texas.
[01:33:41.600 --> 01:33:53.160]  Okay, let's go ahead and get into this report by Kurt Nemo that's up at infowars.com.
[01:33:53.160 --> 01:34:00.560]  I wasn't going to get to this, but this was brought up by the last caller in Illinois.
[01:34:00.560 --> 01:34:05.800]  Read line Rothschild and CIA publications attack Constitution worshippers.
[01:34:05.800 --> 01:34:06.800]  That's a quote.
[01:34:06.800 --> 01:34:11.720]  And then Kurt has links to the documentation that the Rothschild family funds the economists
[01:34:11.720 --> 01:34:12.720]  along with the CIA.
[01:34:12.720 --> 01:34:17.280]  And of course the federal government puts out all these reports demonizing constitutionalists
[01:34:17.280 --> 01:34:19.400]  so you know about that.
[01:34:19.400 --> 01:34:24.520]  And it's got all the quotes here about we've got to get rid of this idea that we can't
[01:34:24.520 --> 01:34:28.120]  get rid of the Constitution because it's bad and it's undemocratic.
[01:34:28.120 --> 01:34:31.080]  And the founding fathers were racist.
[01:34:31.080 --> 01:34:36.040]  Well at that time, Africa was selling slaves, the Arabs were selling slaves, Europe was
[01:34:36.040 --> 01:34:40.920]  selling slaves, the caste system in India, that was slavery, slavery in China, caste
[01:34:40.920 --> 01:34:47.120]  system where you couldn't get out of your caste, same thing as slavery in Japan.
[01:34:47.120 --> 01:34:49.560]  Just different names for slavery.
[01:34:49.560 --> 01:34:53.940]  But many of the founding fathers said we should outlaw this, that was part of the debate.
[01:34:53.940 --> 01:35:01.720]  So it was that idea that led globally towards the move that started in England to end slavery
[01:35:01.720 --> 01:35:03.320]  as we know it.
[01:35:03.320 --> 01:35:11.040]  But the quotes that she went over, the statements they're teaching in school, that's exactly
[01:35:11.040 --> 01:35:12.200]  what was being taught.
[01:35:12.200 --> 01:35:16.520]  The economists argued against the Constitution is the same one used by liberal academics.
[01:35:16.520 --> 01:35:19.280]  The document is antiquated, the product of a bygone era.
[01:35:19.280 --> 01:35:20.280]  These are quotes.
[01:35:20.280 --> 01:35:23.480]  The founding fathers were afraid of democracy taking hold.
[01:35:23.480 --> 01:35:28.040]  So they crafted a document designed to exclude the common people and preserve their aristocratic
[01:35:28.040 --> 01:35:29.040]  position.
[01:35:29.040 --> 01:35:34.080]  No, they were middle class wealthy people tired of the offshore England, the globalist
[01:35:34.080 --> 01:35:39.400]  at the time, the mercantilist not allowing them to have freedom to build their own factories,
[01:35:39.400 --> 01:35:41.680]  their own industries.
[01:35:41.680 --> 01:35:48.760]  And the founders said we have a bill of rights to protect the minority as well as the majority.
[01:35:48.760 --> 01:35:51.880]  This is the big secret that they don't want you to know when they teach this to your kids
[01:35:51.880 --> 01:35:54.080]  in public school.
[01:35:54.080 --> 01:35:59.760]  Democracy, pure democracy, is two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner.
[01:35:59.760 --> 01:36:05.280]  Let's go back 2600 years to Greece where democracy came from.
[01:36:05.280 --> 01:36:11.400]  Only the aristocracy was allowed to vote and they would have a bucket for black rocks
[01:36:11.400 --> 01:36:14.760]  and a bucket for white rocks.
[01:36:14.760 --> 01:36:19.880]  And a white rock was a yay and a black rock was a nay, a no vote.
[01:36:19.880 --> 01:36:24.360]  They would routinely kill members of the aristocracy generally by throwing them off a 500 foot
[01:36:24.360 --> 01:36:29.400]  cliff or higher, but they had several cliffs they would do it from, different cities.
[01:36:29.400 --> 01:36:34.240]  If they disagreed with them, they would vote to kill them.
[01:36:34.240 --> 01:36:35.240]  They would have votes.
[01:36:35.240 --> 01:36:37.960]  Oh, we voted to kill you.
[01:36:37.960 --> 01:36:38.960]  We don't like what you're doing.
[01:36:38.960 --> 01:36:46.440]  Many of the most famous philosophers were murdered, thrown off cliffs or parapets of
[01:36:46.440 --> 01:36:55.800]  castles to their deaths in a democracy if 51% vote to take the other 49% property, it happens.
[01:36:55.800 --> 01:37:00.880]  In a republic, your life, your liberty, your property, your pursuit of happiness, your second
[01:37:00.880 --> 01:37:05.320]  amendment, your privacy, it's protected even if the big banks that own the mainstream
[01:37:05.320 --> 01:37:12.200]  media brainwashed 51% who are on welfare, that's now the case on one form or the other,
[01:37:12.200 --> 01:37:13.560]  to rob you.
[01:37:13.560 --> 01:37:17.480]  But the big lie is the globalists say, oh, we're going to rob everybody with globalism
[01:37:17.480 --> 01:37:19.080]  to help the poor.
[01:37:19.080 --> 01:37:22.360]  And then every time you look at a U.N. program, it gives the money to the elite, not to the
[01:37:22.360 --> 01:37:23.360]  poor.
[01:37:23.360 --> 01:37:28.440]  So globalism is an even bigger fraud on that front.
[01:37:28.440 --> 01:37:30.560]  So we had that article by Curt Nimo.
[01:37:30.560 --> 01:37:33.800]  But here's some other articles, credit unions bailed out.
[01:37:33.800 --> 01:37:38.640]  What a deceptive headline from the Wall Street Journal, U.S. backs 30 billion in bonds to
[01:37:38.640 --> 01:37:44.800]  the stabilized key institutions, subprime legacy, and it goes on to say they actually
[01:37:44.800 --> 01:37:50.800]  seize credit unions and are giving this money to the private federal reserve that got more
[01:37:50.800 --> 01:37:54.120]  power this year out of the crisis they created.
[01:37:54.120 --> 01:38:00.600]  And that's why many of these credit unions are saying no to the money.
[01:38:00.600 --> 01:38:07.400]  Small business banks may spurn or refuse Obama's 30 billion program because it gives
[01:38:07.400 --> 01:38:12.440]  the government and the private megabanks that control this new private board the control
[01:38:12.440 --> 01:38:13.680]  to take them over.
[01:38:13.680 --> 01:38:14.680]  It's like the mafia.
[01:38:14.680 --> 01:38:15.680]  Let me give you a loan.
[01:38:15.680 --> 01:38:18.840]  I want to take good cares of you.
[01:38:18.840 --> 01:38:20.200]  But that's not what's going on.
[01:38:20.200 --> 01:38:23.960]  They want to get in your life, in your door.
[01:38:23.960 --> 01:38:27.600]  And that's what this takeover is all about.
[01:38:27.600 --> 01:38:33.880]  Continuing though, Bernanke says economy recovering more slowly than policymakers would like, Bloomberg
[01:38:33.880 --> 01:38:34.880]  reports.
[01:38:34.880 --> 01:38:37.440]  Isn't that funny?
[01:38:37.440 --> 01:38:43.680]  Just last Monday, what, seven, eight days ago, they came out and the Fed said that
[01:38:43.680 --> 01:38:47.320]  we ended the recession in June of last year, 15 months ago.
[01:38:47.320 --> 01:38:51.480]  But his answer is more stimulus money, more banker bailouts, which then never hit the
[01:38:51.480 --> 01:38:52.480]  street.
[01:38:52.480 --> 01:38:55.800]  If you're going to have socialism, you might as well actually spread it amongst the people.
[01:38:55.800 --> 01:38:58.960]  Then they'll buy something and that will help what's left of our economy.
[01:38:58.960 --> 01:39:00.800]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[01:39:00.800 --> 01:39:04.960]  When they got those tens of trillions of dollars a year and a half ago or more, you never saw
[01:39:04.960 --> 01:39:07.240]  the money lending tightened up even more.
[01:39:07.240 --> 01:39:08.240]  Why should the banks loan?
[01:39:08.240 --> 01:39:09.240]  They already have the money.
[01:39:09.240 --> 01:39:15.720]  Now they can buy real assets themselves through investment banking.
[01:39:15.720 --> 01:39:18.600]  Continuing here, there's a great article, the economic collapse we have linked up on
[01:39:18.600 --> 01:39:26.320]  infowars.com and it goes through 19 incredible facts dealing with the deindustrialization
[01:39:26.320 --> 01:39:29.640]  of America that will blow your mind.
[01:39:29.640 --> 01:39:31.820]  And here's just some of them racing through them.
[01:39:31.820 --> 01:39:35.880]  The United States has approximately 42,400 factories.
[01:39:35.880 --> 01:39:44.200]  Since 2001, about 75% of those factories employed over 500 people than when they were still
[01:39:44.200 --> 01:39:45.200]  in operation.
[01:39:45.200 --> 01:39:49.320]  Number two, Dell Incorporated, one of the America's largest manufacturers of computers
[01:39:49.320 --> 01:39:53.720]  has announced plans to dramatically expand its operations in China with an investment
[01:39:53.720 --> 01:39:56.960]  of over $100 billion over the next decade.
[01:39:56.960 --> 01:40:01.080]  Number three, Dell has announced it will be closing its largest U.S. manufacturing facility
[01:40:01.080 --> 01:40:06.320]  in Winston-Salem, North Carolina in November, approximately 900 jobs will be lost.
[01:40:06.320 --> 01:40:11.840]  Number four, in 2008, 1.2 billion cell phones were sold worldwide, 1.2 billion.
[01:40:11.840 --> 01:40:14.040]  So how many of them were manufactured in the United States?
[01:40:14.040 --> 01:40:15.040]  Zero.
[01:40:15.040 --> 01:40:17.120]  Every one of these has a link to mainstream news.
[01:40:17.120 --> 01:40:21.920]  Number five, according to a new study conducted by the Economic Policy Institute in the U.S.
[01:40:21.920 --> 01:40:24.960]  trade deficit with China continues to increase at its current rate.
[01:40:24.960 --> 01:40:30.080]  Again, U.S. economy will lose over half a million jobs this year alone just due to China.
[01:40:30.080 --> 01:40:34.200]  So buy that Chinese cheap product, lose your job, and hey, so what?
[01:40:34.200 --> 01:40:36.640]  Number five, there's a football game on, so what?
[01:40:36.640 --> 01:40:37.640]  Shut up, Alex.
[01:40:37.640 --> 01:40:38.640]  There's more important things.
[01:40:38.640 --> 01:40:42.800]  Number five, according to the new study conducted by the Economic Policy Institute, if the U.S.
[01:40:42.800 --> 01:40:46.200]  trade deficit with China continues to increase the current rate, again, U.S. economy will
[01:40:46.200 --> 01:40:48.640]  lose over half a million jobs this year alone.
[01:40:48.640 --> 01:40:53.040]  Number six, as the end of July, the U.S. trade deficit with China has risen 18% compared
[01:40:53.040 --> 01:40:55.600]  to the same period a year ago, it's getting worse.
[01:40:55.600 --> 01:41:00.000]  Number seven, the United States has lost a total of 5.5 million manufacturing jobs since
[01:41:00.000 --> 01:41:01.800]  October 2000.
[01:41:01.800 --> 01:41:06.560]  Number eight, according to tax notes between 99 and 2008, employment at the foreign affiliates
[01:41:06.560 --> 01:41:12.320]  of the U.S. parent companies increased an astounding 30% to 10.1 million.
[01:41:12.320 --> 01:41:16.760]  During the exact same time period, U.S. employment at American multinational corporations declined
[01:41:16.760 --> 01:41:22.000]  8% to 21.8 million, 21.1 million, you see the difference?
[01:41:22.000 --> 01:41:23.200]  It's upside down.
[01:41:23.200 --> 01:41:29.760]  And number nine, in 1959, manufacturing represented 50, let me say that again, I'm trying to go
[01:41:29.760 --> 01:41:31.320]  too quick and I'm not good at that.
[01:41:31.320 --> 01:41:36.360]  In 1959, manufacturing represented 28% of U.S. economic output.
[01:41:36.360 --> 01:41:41.600]  In 2008, it represented 11.5%, and I would add that's cooked numbers.
[01:41:41.600 --> 01:41:46.600]  In 1958, manufacturing meant heavy manufacturing for tax breaks.
[01:41:46.600 --> 01:41:53.080]  Now if you put hamburgers together, or if I ship DVDs out, I can get the manufacturing
[01:41:53.080 --> 01:41:54.080]  tax credit.
[01:41:54.080 --> 01:41:56.320]  So most of that is even skewed numbers.
[01:41:56.320 --> 01:41:59.760]  So in 59, manufacturing presented 28%.
[01:41:59.760 --> 01:42:03.320]  Now it represents 11.5%, and that's with cooked numbers.
[01:42:03.320 --> 01:42:07.600]  Number 10, Ford Motor Company recently announced the closure of facility produces the Ford
[01:42:07.600 --> 01:42:13.000]  Ranger in St. Paul, Minnesota, approximately 750 good paying middle class jobs are going
[01:42:13.000 --> 01:42:17.480]  to be lost because making Ford Rangers in Minnesota does not fit into Ford's new global
[01:42:17.480 --> 01:42:19.360]  manufacturing strategy.
[01:42:19.360 --> 01:42:25.160]  And remember all the tens of billions in bailout to GM and Chrysler?
[01:42:25.160 --> 01:42:30.160]  Almost all of that went to build plants in Brazil, and in Russia, and in China.
[01:42:30.160 --> 01:42:34.000]  Number 11, I'll never get to all of this, it gets even worse than the other points.
[01:42:34.000 --> 01:42:35.720]  How am I ever going to cover all of this?
[01:42:35.720 --> 01:42:39.960]  And I haven't even gotten into the truth about Obamacare, even worse than critics had
[01:42:39.960 --> 01:42:46.000]  thought, and then I've got this black water nose over here, but we'll try to get to it,
[01:42:46.000 --> 01:42:48.600]  but I also want to take your calls.
[01:42:48.600 --> 01:42:53.280]  Stay where this will be right back after this quick break, you can see it all at prisonplanet.com
[01:42:53.280 --> 01:42:57.960]  and infowars.com, and we'll cover more of this tomorrow at 11am central on the syndicated
[01:42:57.960 --> 01:42:58.960]  radio broadcast.
[01:42:58.960 --> 01:43:05.520]  You may be arrested and or subject to other police action.
[01:43:05.520 --> 01:43:10.520]  Here on E is here, the grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[01:43:10.520 --> 01:43:13.080]  It really says that the state is God.
[01:43:13.080 --> 01:43:17.600]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most impressive police states
[01:43:17.600 --> 01:43:18.840]  on earth.
[01:43:18.840 --> 01:43:23.640]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being
[01:43:23.640 --> 01:43:25.480]  expanded nationwide.
[01:43:25.480 --> 01:43:29.520]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an
[01:43:29.520 --> 01:43:31.560]  old powerful shadow state.
[01:43:31.560 --> 01:43:36.200]  Police state 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen, prepare
[01:43:36.200 --> 01:43:41.760]  to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship, body scanners, sound cameras,
[01:43:41.760 --> 01:43:45.880]  citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[01:43:45.880 --> 01:43:49.400]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[01:43:49.400 --> 01:43:51.440]  The police state isn't coming.
[01:43:51.440 --> 01:43:52.440]  It's here.

[01:44:01.120 --> 01:44:05.480]  Hi folks this is Alex Jones asking you for a minute of your time to tell you about soap.
[01:44:05.480 --> 01:44:09.760]  Not detergents but good old fashioned pure soap made by the Calvin soap company, a family
[01:44:09.760 --> 01:44:11.800]  owned and operated American company.
[01:44:11.800 --> 01:44:16.600]  My family, staff, friends and radio listeners are constantly telling me how much they love
[01:44:16.600 --> 01:44:19.240]  these products for bath, air, laundry and dishes.
[01:44:19.240 --> 01:44:23.280]  There is nothing like these factory direct, big money saving triple concentrated soaps
[01:44:23.280 --> 01:44:24.280]  anywhere.

[01:44:32.820 --> 01:44:36.920]  Let's talk to the owner of 5 Star Soap, Marty Schachter and see what he has to say.
[01:44:36.920 --> 01:44:43.600]  As founder and owner for over 63 years, people keep asking me, how's business?
[01:44:43.600 --> 01:44:47.720]  I'm happy to say our business is going down the drain.

[01:45:00.000 --> 01:45:01.880]  Thank you.
[01:45:01.880 --> 01:45:06.040]  You've heard Alex explain how the Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system
[01:45:06.040 --> 01:45:10.760]  with your self produced colloidal silver solutions, yet many are unaware of the entire function
[01:45:10.760 --> 01:45:14.600]  of the silver lung system and how it has been designed to deliver your silver solutions
[01:45:14.600 --> 01:45:17.280]  anywhere in or on the body.
[01:45:17.280 --> 01:45:22.040]  My name is Mario Safaldi and I'm the developer of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:45:22.040 --> 01:45:26.640]  Not only does the silver lung system produce endless colloidal and ionic silver solutions,
[01:45:26.640 --> 01:45:31.280]  it also comes equipped with the proper applicators and devices needed to deliver your silver
[01:45:31.280 --> 01:45:34.800]  solutions directly to key target areas.
[01:45:34.800 --> 01:45:42.680]  This includes the eyes, ears, nose, lungs, topically to the skin and orally for the digestive system.
[01:45:42.680 --> 01:45:49.960]  Be sure to watch our new 7 minute video tour of the Silver Lungs System at www.silverlungs.com
[01:45:49.960 --> 01:45:53.080]  to learn more about how the Silver Lungs System works.
[01:45:53.080 --> 01:46:00.760]  As well, we are always ready to answer any questions you may have, that's www.silverlungs.com.
[01:46:00.760 --> 01:46:05.400]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:46:05.400 --> 01:46:09.720]  Number 1, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:46:09.720 --> 01:46:14.400]  Number 2, our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company allows
[01:46:14.400 --> 01:46:15.400]  you to have.
[01:46:15.400 --> 01:46:21.080]  It's true, total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:46:21.080 --> 01:46:25.400]  Number 3, in some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:46:25.400 --> 01:46:29.400]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:46:29.400 --> 01:46:32.880]  Number 4, dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:46:32.880 --> 01:46:36.600]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather related onages.
[01:46:36.600 --> 01:46:41.320]  Number 5, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[01:46:41.320 --> 01:46:45.160]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science,
[01:46:45.160 --> 01:46:46.520]  one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:46:46.520 --> 01:46:50.760]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[01:46:50.760 --> 01:46:52.440]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[01:46:52.440 --> 01:47:02.200]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[01:47:02.200 --> 01:47:13.040]  Coast to coast, direct from Austin, you're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[01:47:13.040 --> 01:47:19.200]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the Resistance.
[01:47:19.200 --> 01:47:22.760]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:22.760 --> 01:47:28.480]  These economic numbers I'm covering just scratch the surface, but as of the end of 2009, less
[01:47:28.480 --> 01:47:33.740]  than 12 million Americans worked in manufacturing, and none of this happened by accident.
[01:47:33.740 --> 01:47:38.000]  This is the globalist program to bring the United States to its knees.
[01:47:38.000 --> 01:47:42.880]  We fund the world government, we provide the military, the globalists provide the stage
[01:47:42.880 --> 01:47:47.840]  terror attacks to get us to go along with it while we're being shut down in the process.
[01:47:47.840 --> 01:47:55.040]  Number 12, the United States today, consumption accounts for 70 percent of gross domestic
[01:47:55.040 --> 01:48:01.400]  product of the 70 percent over half is spent on services.
[01:48:01.400 --> 01:48:05.720]  Continuing number 13, the United States has lost a whopping 32 percent of its manufacturing
[01:48:05.720 --> 01:48:07.920]  jobs since the year 2000.
[01:48:07.920 --> 01:48:12.800]  Number 14, the United States in 2001 ranked fourth in the world in per capita broadband
[01:48:12.800 --> 01:48:13.800]  internet use.
[01:48:13.800 --> 01:48:16.120]  Today, it ranks 15th.
[01:48:16.120 --> 01:48:18.840]  We're just stone age compared to many.
[01:48:18.840 --> 01:48:23.880]  15, manufacturing employment in the U.S. computer industry is actually lower in 2010 than it
[01:48:23.880 --> 01:48:25.880]  was in 1975.
[01:48:25.880 --> 01:48:30.800]  16, printed circuit boards are used in tens of thousands of different products.
[01:48:30.800 --> 01:48:32.880]  Asia now produces 84 percent of them.
[01:48:32.880 --> 01:48:37.760]  17, the United States spends approximately $3.90 on Chinese goods.
[01:48:37.760 --> 01:48:42.040]  For every $1, the Chinese spend on goods from the United States, that's usually raw material
[01:48:42.040 --> 01:48:43.040]  as well.
[01:48:43.040 --> 01:48:49.360]  18, one prominent economist is projecting the Chinese economy will be three times larger
[01:48:49.360 --> 01:48:52.000]  than the U.S. economy by the year 2040.
[01:48:52.000 --> 01:48:57.880]  Number 19, the U.S. Census Bureau says 43.6 million Americans are now living in poverty
[01:48:57.880 --> 01:49:01.320]  and that number are also on food stamps.
[01:49:01.320 --> 01:49:02.840]  And just goes on and on.
[01:49:02.840 --> 01:49:05.080]  Now, look at this healthcare information.
[01:49:05.080 --> 01:49:06.960]  And we've read the legislation that's now law.
[01:49:06.960 --> 01:49:08.040]  This is accurate.
[01:49:08.040 --> 01:49:12.520]  From the examiner, Obamacare won't decrease health costs for the government.
[01:49:12.520 --> 01:49:16.720]  According to Medicare Actuary, it will increase costs the same as likely to happen for privately
[01:49:16.720 --> 01:49:19.320]  funded insurance, health-funded insurance.
[01:49:19.320 --> 01:49:23.240]  And of course, the insurance companies wrote it, of course, it will get them more money.
[01:49:23.240 --> 01:49:27.960]  As written, the Obamacare covers elective abortions, contrary to Obama's promise that
[01:49:27.960 --> 01:49:28.960]  it wouldn't.
[01:49:28.960 --> 01:49:30.360]  You've got to pay for abortions now.
[01:49:30.360 --> 01:49:34.760]  That means tax dollars will go for it, kind of like Travis County passing abortions with
[01:49:34.760 --> 01:49:40.160]  the hospital district taxes my office has to pay into, pays to kill babies.
[01:49:40.160 --> 01:49:45.880]  Obamacare won't allow employers or most small businesses to keep the coverage they have.
[01:49:45.880 --> 01:49:50.320]  Obamacare will force you to buy overpriced insurance.
[01:49:50.320 --> 01:49:52.920]  And it talks about the numbers of employees that will have to be let go.
[01:49:52.920 --> 01:49:55.560]  Yeah, I don't know how we're going to pay for all this.
[01:49:55.560 --> 01:49:59.080]  Obamacare will increase insurance premiums in some places.
[01:49:59.080 --> 01:50:00.560]  It already has.
[01:50:00.560 --> 01:50:06.320]  Insurers suddenly forced to cover clients' children under age 26 have massively increased
[01:50:06.320 --> 01:50:07.320]  premiums.
[01:50:07.320 --> 01:50:11.200]  Obamacare will force seasonal employers, especially ski and amusement park industries,
[01:50:11.200 --> 01:50:14.400]  to pay huge fines, cut hours, or layoff employees.
[01:50:14.400 --> 01:50:19.040]  Obamacare forces states to guarantee not only payment, but also treatment for indigent
[01:50:19.040 --> 01:50:21.080]  Medicaid patients.
[01:50:21.080 --> 01:50:24.400]  Many doctors now dropping out, refusing to be part of it.
[01:50:24.400 --> 01:50:28.240]  Obamacare imposes a huge non-medical tax compliance burden on small businesses that
[01:50:28.240 --> 01:50:33.480]  will require them to mail IRS of 1099 tax forms to every vendor in whom they make purchases
[01:50:33.480 --> 01:50:35.360]  of more than 600 a year.
[01:50:35.360 --> 01:50:39.760]  Obamacare allows IRS to confiscate part of all of your tax refund if you do not purchase
[01:50:39.760 --> 01:50:41.520]  a qualified insurance plan.
[01:50:41.520 --> 01:50:46.600]  This bill funds 1600 new IRS agents with guns, I should add, to make sure Americans stay
[01:50:46.600 --> 01:50:47.600]  in line.
[01:50:47.600 --> 01:50:50.040]  Okay, let's now get to this report.
[01:50:50.040 --> 01:50:57.400]  Obama healthcare reform imposes 3.8% tax on all income from home sales and home rental
[01:50:57.400 --> 01:50:58.400]  income.
[01:50:58.400 --> 01:51:00.040]  Gotta love that.
[01:51:00.040 --> 01:51:02.520]  Gotta love that.
[01:51:02.520 --> 01:51:03.520]  You know what?
[01:51:03.520 --> 01:51:04.520]  I'm just out of time.
[01:51:04.520 --> 01:51:06.240]  I want to take calls.
[01:51:06.240 --> 01:51:08.720]  I haven't even gotten to this out of the nation.
[01:51:08.720 --> 01:51:11.600]  I'm going to cover this more tomorrow.
[01:51:11.600 --> 01:51:16.200]  U.S. businessmen in sworn federal testimony, they're getting similar testimony from the
[01:51:16.200 --> 01:51:22.000]  other people, Blackwater paid me to buy steroids and weapons on black market for its shooters.
[01:51:22.000 --> 01:51:25.440]  It describes them driving around shooting people for fun, which you already have videos
[01:51:25.440 --> 01:51:30.440]  of other contractors doing, it's all over YouTube, huge parties, quote, running around
[01:51:30.440 --> 01:51:37.760]  naked, reportedly sex parties, piles of cocaine, watching people snort an ounce of cocaine
[01:51:37.760 --> 01:51:42.480]  individually, just total insanity.
[01:51:42.480 --> 01:51:45.460]  And clearly it shows black market arms sales as well.
[01:51:45.460 --> 01:51:49.360]  That's the nation magazine.
[01:51:49.360 --> 01:51:52.520]  And now Eric Prince hides out in the Middle East.
[01:51:52.520 --> 01:51:54.560]  He doesn't even live here anymore.
[01:51:54.560 --> 01:51:59.040]  And then it's admitted in the news they've got foreign mercenary groups spying on Americans,
[01:51:59.040 --> 01:52:04.560]  other mercenary groups, Dyncore caught running all these UN child kidnapping rings, runs
[01:52:04.560 --> 01:52:07.840]  most the CPS kidnapping operations down the U.S.
[01:52:07.840 --> 01:52:10.440]  That's mainstream news.
[01:52:10.440 --> 01:52:15.040]  I mean, you just can't make up the magnitude of corruption here.
[01:52:15.040 --> 01:52:18.920]  Since 1947, the government's been able to operate in total secrecy, giving trillions
[01:52:18.920 --> 01:52:21.520]  of dollars a year into its black budget.
[01:52:21.520 --> 01:52:23.480]  What do you think was going to happen?
[01:52:23.480 --> 01:52:26.160]  It's just lawless craziness.
[01:52:26.160 --> 01:52:30.520]  And if you say, Hey, I want some transparency in the Pentagon, you know, trillions of dollars
[01:52:30.520 --> 01:52:32.120]  a year to the Pentagon, it's out of control.
[01:52:32.120 --> 01:52:38.800]  It's a shut up, commie, you know, al-Qaeda lover.
[01:52:38.800 --> 01:52:41.040]  So I guess it's okay what black waters reportedly doing.
[01:52:41.040 --> 01:52:42.040]  I guess I'm a patriot.
[01:52:42.040 --> 01:52:45.960]  I guess it's good to shoot into houses of innocent people for no reason, reportedly.
[01:52:45.960 --> 01:52:48.600]  Let's talk to James and George James, you're on the air.
[01:52:48.600 --> 01:52:55.480]  Well, yes, I'm, I'm an old, I'm, I was in the military a long time ago and I'm, I'm
[01:52:55.480 --> 01:52:58.600]  an old, I'm, I was an NSA and all that.
[01:52:58.600 --> 01:53:05.320]  And in America's, this does not realize how great iron the military is.
[01:53:05.320 --> 01:53:13.960]  The military is like what you said, uh, that this stuff has been planned since almost 1776.
[01:53:13.960 --> 01:53:21.000]  The military is going to take over, you know, you're using the military, the global corporations
[01:53:21.000 --> 01:53:25.080]  are using the military to be the enforcement arm of their takeover.
[01:53:25.080 --> 01:53:26.080]  Right.
[01:53:26.080 --> 01:53:29.720]  Right, right, the corporations are, but I'm talking about the implementation.
[01:53:29.720 --> 01:53:34.440]  The Americans, uh, we're, we're just citizens and we're not used to all this stuff.
[01:53:34.440 --> 01:53:35.440]  And that's right.
[01:53:35.440 --> 01:53:40.200]  The military, the army times reports and the New York times is, it's in my film, police
[01:53:40.200 --> 01:53:44.360]  state for the rise of FEMA is training for gun confiscation.
[01:53:44.360 --> 01:53:48.880]  It's now admitted, but the average conservative will go, I'm turning my guns in, I support
[01:53:48.880 --> 01:53:49.880]  the military.
[01:53:49.880 --> 01:53:55.360]  Oh, and they don't realize how much it's like watching the born identity.
[01:53:55.360 --> 01:53:57.640]  They don't realize how much Colbert stuff it's got.
[01:53:57.640 --> 01:53:59.240]  Hey, it was watching your movie there.
[01:53:59.240 --> 01:54:05.120]  Well, sir, you know, you know, the born identity, born ultimatum is, is based off admitted,
[01:54:05.120 --> 01:54:08.680]  declassified army, brainwashing programs.
[01:54:08.680 --> 01:54:09.960]  That's all declassified.
[01:54:09.960 --> 01:54:15.720]  That came out in 77 that they were putting troops on drugs, brainwashing them, erasing
[01:54:15.720 --> 01:54:16.720]  their memories.
[01:54:16.720 --> 01:54:18.720]  Uh, I appreciate your call.
[01:54:18.720 --> 01:54:19.720]  Great points, James.
[01:54:19.720 --> 01:54:20.720]  David, New York, you're on the air.
[01:54:20.720 --> 01:54:21.720]  Got to move quick now.
[01:54:21.720 --> 01:54:25.640]  How you doing, Dave, I'm a US Marine veteran.
[01:54:25.640 --> 01:54:31.160]  I served in the epoxy wars over there in Iraq and, uh, you know, I just wanted to, uh,
[01:54:31.160 --> 01:54:35.160]  my stringent second amendment, you know, supporter, and it's one of the, when you think
[01:54:35.160 --> 01:54:39.680]  they're going to finally collapse us and, uh, come down on us, well, they want to incrementally
[01:54:39.680 --> 01:54:43.800]  collapse us like a frog in a boiling pot of water, but the American people are waking
[01:54:43.800 --> 01:54:44.800]  up.
[01:54:44.800 --> 01:54:48.920]  So the globalists may back off a little bit in the collapse so that we go back to sleep.
[01:54:48.920 --> 01:54:53.960]  You know, it's kind of like this, if they raise gas up to $4 a gallon, then when it
[01:54:53.960 --> 01:54:56.800]  drops down to three, we don't mind it.
[01:54:56.800 --> 01:55:02.960]  Even though a year before that it was two, see it's $2 a gallon in 2005 or so.
[01:55:02.960 --> 01:55:08.160]  Then in 2008 it goes up to $4 a gallon and then when it drops down to three, we're not
[01:55:08.160 --> 01:55:11.280]  complaining about three, even though it's a dollar more than two.
[01:55:11.280 --> 01:55:12.280]  Exactly.
[01:55:12.280 --> 01:55:15.200]  They just want to keep us numb in the brain.
[01:55:15.200 --> 01:55:16.760]  It's psychological warfare.
[01:55:16.760 --> 01:55:17.760]  Go ahead, Dave.
[01:55:17.760 --> 01:55:18.760]  Sorry.
[01:55:18.760 --> 01:55:25.080]  I just also want to say, um, another point, kind of weird, but, um, you know, I'm a second
[01:55:25.080 --> 01:55:30.840]  amendment supporter and I'm Puerto Rican and I actually look like I'm black, a color person,
[01:55:30.840 --> 01:55:37.040]  but, um, that's really weird when people see me wearing Patriot shirts and I'm a real Patriot
[01:55:37.040 --> 01:55:38.040]  type of person.
[01:55:38.040 --> 01:55:39.040]  Well, that's the media.
[01:55:39.040 --> 01:55:43.920]  They tell you, if you have any skin pigment and you're tall, dark and handsome, you're
[01:55:43.920 --> 01:55:48.360]  not allowed to love freedom in the second amendment and property rights and they demonize
[01:55:48.360 --> 01:55:53.960]  it like it's racist and bad to own property when everything in the bill of rights empowers
[01:55:53.960 --> 01:55:58.920]  humanity, not being spied on, being able to defend yourself, having due process.
[01:55:58.920 --> 01:56:04.120]  That belongs to you because you have red blood and God, God bless you.
[01:56:04.120 --> 01:56:05.120]  Anything else, Dave?
[01:56:05.120 --> 01:56:06.120]  Yes.
[01:56:06.120 --> 01:56:08.120]  I just, you know, you covered that perfectly.
[01:56:08.120 --> 01:56:13.440]  I was just going to say that and, um, Alex, I appreciate what you're doing.
[01:56:13.440 --> 01:56:14.440]  You're an outstanding man.
[01:56:14.440 --> 01:56:16.600]  You woke me up about a year ago.
[01:56:16.600 --> 01:56:20.440]  Like I said, I would, I am a veteran and, um, I'm just trying to wake up my old brothers
[01:56:20.440 --> 01:56:23.440]  that are in the Marines and you're a great man.
[01:56:23.440 --> 01:56:24.440]  Thank you for it.
[01:56:24.440 --> 01:56:25.440]  God bless you, Dave.
[01:56:25.440 --> 01:56:32.480]  The word is, thank you, but I mean, it's sick that I, I read it in the news, the media
[01:56:32.480 --> 01:56:34.720]  saying, Hey, don't be into that Patriot stuff.
[01:56:34.720 --> 01:56:39.560]  If you're Hispanic or black or whatever, you know, that's evil racist people that want
[01:56:39.560 --> 01:56:43.960]  you to have your own right to grow a garden or own a gun or own your own property or have
[01:56:43.960 --> 01:56:47.680]  privacy, that's racism, being a slave.
[01:56:47.680 --> 01:56:50.040]  That's patriotism.
[01:56:50.040 --> 01:56:51.240]  You've got red blood.
[01:56:51.240 --> 01:56:53.400]  I've got red blood.
[01:56:53.400 --> 01:56:59.600]  We're all human beings who love liberty and have the same dreams and we can't let anybody
[01:56:59.600 --> 01:57:07.240]  take those dreams away 99% of the time in history, since recorded history, people don't
[01:57:07.240 --> 01:57:08.240]  have freedom.
[01:57:08.240 --> 01:57:09.240]  They live in tyranny.
[01:57:09.240 --> 01:57:16.240]  They know liberty creates wealth and independence and that's why the White House science are
[01:57:16.240 --> 01:57:23.240]  and the council on foreign relations and the UN openly say they want global government
[01:57:23.240 --> 01:57:29.040]  to literally shut down our economy so they can control your life.
[01:57:29.040 --> 01:57:31.440]  It is so elementary.
[01:57:31.440 --> 01:57:38.240]  It is so simple that a lot of people miss it, but it's that simple and it's very exciting
[01:57:38.240 --> 01:57:44.320]  to see more and more people, mainstream news folks like Limbaugh and Beck and others admit
[01:57:44.320 --> 01:57:47.640]  the globalist want to destroy the economy by design.
[01:57:47.640 --> 01:57:48.640]  We're out of time.
[01:57:48.640 --> 01:57:49.640]  God bless you all.
[01:57:49.640 --> 01:57:50.640]  See you back tomorrow at 11 a.m. Central.
[01:57:50.640 --> 01:57:52.960]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:57:52.960 --> 01:57:56.120]  Remember when I said you spell freedom, F-O-O-D?
[01:57:56.120 --> 01:57:57.120]  It's really true.
[01:57:57.120 --> 01:58:01.720]  Legislation is in the process of restricting the growing and sharing of food and a record
[01:58:01.720 --> 01:58:06.800]  number of Americans over 43 million depend on the government to feed themselves.
[01:58:06.800 --> 01:58:09.080]  Food prices are going up for Americans.
[01:58:09.080 --> 01:58:12.240]  Prices are going up even for eFoodsDirect.com.
[01:58:12.240 --> 01:58:15.680]  This will require their first price increase in three years.
[01:58:15.680 --> 01:58:19.880]  The most important thing Americans can do for their own freedom and survival in these
[01:58:19.880 --> 01:58:24.040]  hardest of times is to get supplies of high quality, storable food.
