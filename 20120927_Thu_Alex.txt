[00:00.000 --> 00:10.000]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[00:10.000 --> 00:11.000]  You want answers?
[00:11.000 --> 00:13.000]  Well, so does he.
[00:13.000 --> 00:17.000]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:17.000 --> 00:27.000]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:27.000 --> 00:34.000]  Well, Europe is continuing its controlled implosion by the globalists because they consolidate power.
[00:34.000 --> 00:43.000]  And the controlled disintegration is also gaining speed here in the United States and the rest of North America.
[00:43.000 --> 00:49.000]  We are going to be here for the next three hours today, the always thought-provoking.
[00:49.000 --> 00:58.000]  David Ike will be joining us coming up in the second hour. And then Amy Larson, they're going ahead with charges against her.
[00:58.000 --> 01:11.000]  She was arraigned yesterday for riding with chalk on the sidewalk that you should YouTube Building 7, the 47th-story building that the CIA was housed in that blew up on 9-11.
[01:11.000 --> 01:23.000]  And we have the police on tape on CNN saying get back to bringing it down and CNN and BBC saying that it fell in its own footprint from fires before it even fell.
[01:23.000 --> 01:30.000]  That's like if you called 9-11 and said someone just shot my neighbor and the cops pull up and you're shooting the neighbor as they pull up.
[01:30.000 --> 01:35.000]  You need to call the cops after you shoot the neighbor.
[01:35.000 --> 01:41.000]  Not say somebody shot my neighbor and then shoot the neighbor as the cops pull up.
[01:41.000 --> 01:49.000]  You want to have Lee Harvey Oswald in custody before you roll newspapers worldwide that he had been captured with his name.
[01:49.000 --> 01:53.000]  Remember the old days they had newspapers coming out on the hour in big cities?
[01:53.000 --> 01:58.000]  That all happened. But I'm already digressing. She's going to be joining us.
[01:58.000 --> 02:08.000]  And I was talking to my crew and I'm like, yeah, we have time tomorrow or Friday. We've got to get out. I want you to videotape me writing her same message on Austin streets.
[02:08.000 --> 02:16.000]  I said, thank God we don't live in the globalist Republic of California where, you know, chalking is not illegal, something all hopscotchers do.
[02:16.000 --> 02:23.000]  And I searched it and found out they arrest you in Austin with pleasure, including political speech.
[02:23.000 --> 02:27.000]  They call it vandalism. The code doesn't actually fit.
[02:27.000 --> 02:30.000]  So soon I'm going to go out and find police and do it.
[02:30.000 --> 02:33.000]  I'm going to write freedom, have them arrest me and then I'm going to fight it in court.
[02:33.000 --> 02:36.000]  Not that I want a court battle, but it's got to be done.
[02:36.000 --> 02:40.000]  It's not vandalism to write with chalk.
[02:40.000 --> 02:47.000]  The only way it would be is if it was profane and violated community agreed upon standards that have been adjudicated.
[02:47.000 --> 02:51.000]  But they all have this color of law situation.
[02:51.000 --> 03:01.000]  Yeah, I saw where women on 11th Street got arrested for doing it right in front of the Texas Capitol, not even on the state grounds, but on the sidewalk across the street.
[03:01.000 --> 03:08.000]  The state police ran across with pleasure and arrested them, landed the free home of the brave, but you don't have political speech.
[03:08.000 --> 03:19.000]  You see, political speech is demonized in this country, whether it's the Dixie chick saying they're anti-warb or whether it's the government saying we want to restrict criticizing Islam,
[03:19.000 --> 03:23.000]  because it's going to cause unrest.
[03:23.000 --> 03:26.000]  The UN wants to restrict free speech as well.
[03:26.000 --> 03:29.000]  This is the whole move we're going towards.
[03:29.000 --> 03:36.000]  And who would have ever thought, land the free home of the brave, don't write your political messages in chalk that wash away.
[03:36.000 --> 03:46.000]  Every ancient culture from Rome to ancient China, even in those tyrannies, they did not mess with the people drawing on the walls graffiti.
[03:46.000 --> 03:49.000]  That was the people's real newspaper.
[03:49.000 --> 03:50.000]  And the system knows this.
[03:50.000 --> 03:56.000]  They know as they get ready to shut down the internet, as we've known, and if they're successful, they're certainly going to try.
[03:56.000 --> 03:57.000]  Doesn't mean they're going to succeed.
[03:57.000 --> 04:01.000]  People are addicted now to free flow of information.
[04:01.000 --> 04:06.000]  They are going to try to go in and shut down what you call graffiti, which will be emergency messages.
[04:06.000 --> 04:11.000]  Or you notice nobody ever gets in trouble for putting up a yard sign saying, hey, yard sale on the telephone pole.
[04:11.000 --> 04:19.000]  But when it's Obama as the joker, oh, the police were on the news saying, let's arrest whoever's doing this, putting up little pieces of paper.
[04:19.000 --> 04:23.000]  And until the public revolted and said, hey, we're going to go out and do this too.
[04:23.000 --> 04:25.000]  This is America.
[04:25.000 --> 04:29.000]  Political speech is the most protected.
[04:29.000 --> 04:33.000]  The most protected unpopular speech is right up there with it.
[04:33.000 --> 04:34.000]  Okay?
[04:34.000 --> 04:36.000]  That's it.
[04:36.000 --> 04:48.000]  Unless you're talking about obscene messages to minors, that's the only speech that which seeks to corrupt the youth that can be restricted historically under common law.
[04:48.000 --> 04:50.000]  British common law, English common law.
[04:50.000 --> 05:00.000]  You notice, though, they bombard the kids with bad messages to screw them up and destroy their innocence all over television now.
[05:00.000 --> 05:10.000]  Alex Jones here with a very important announcement for truth seekers. We've carried a lot of amazing films and books over the years on the online video bookstore at info wars.com.
[05:10.000 --> 05:16.000]  And out of all the titles we've carried, one stands out because it is just so chillingly convincing.
[05:16.000 --> 05:22.000]  And that's Dreams From My Real Father by Joel Gilbert, available at infowars.com.
[05:22.000 --> 05:26.000]  This film exposes the fraud that Obama is like nothing I've seen.
[05:26.000 --> 05:30.000]  If you want to know who Obama's real daddy is, this is the film for you.
[05:30.000 --> 05:34.000]  Don't forget, your purchase supports our broadcast and our growing media network.
[05:34.000 --> 05:37.000]  You'll also find it in FullWarsHop.com.
[05:37.000 --> 05:41.000]  None dare call a conspiracy by Gary Allen, the book that woke me up.
[05:41.000 --> 05:45.000]  We're also carrying behind the green mask, You and a Gender 21, by Rosa Corey.
[05:45.000 --> 05:48.000]  This book is coffin nails to the globalist takeover.
[05:48.000 --> 05:55.000]  The greater good, the most professional and up-to-date film I've ever seen, exposing the scourge that is vaccines.
[05:55.000 --> 06:00.000]  These titles and a lot more are all available at infowarshop.com.
[06:00.000 --> 06:11.000]  The Silver Lungs Generator is the only all-encompassing professional class product for producing endless colloidal and ionic silver solutions right from the convenience of your home.
[06:11.000 --> 06:22.000]  With recent regulations threatening the sale of silver-based supplements, now you can secure yourself and your family by producing your own silver solutions anywhere, anytime.
[06:22.000 --> 06:30.000]  You can have the peace of mind knowing that you can create endless supply of silver anytime, anywhere, for any application.
[06:30.000 --> 06:37.000]  The Silver Lungs Generator is a one-time purchase that requires no maintenance nor replacement parts for the life of the unit.
[06:37.000 --> 06:42.000]  This product was designed to be an invaluable part of your vital preparations.

[06:49.000 --> 07:00.000]  please visit our website at www.silverlungs.com for more information on why you should be producing your own silver solutions right from your home forever.
[07:20.000 --> 07:27.000]  The only strategy to counter this is to freeze your food cost at today's prices by getting your own supply of foods from eFoods direct now.
[07:27.000 --> 07:31.000]  As the price of raw ingredients increases, eFoods will have to raise prices too.
[07:31.000 --> 07:33.000]  Now is the time to get your supply.
[07:33.000 --> 07:37.000]  I recently increased my supply from eFoods direct because we have all known this was coming.
[07:37.000 --> 07:40.000]  You know about their delicious long-term storable foods.
[07:40.000 --> 07:47.000]  The fact is you can eat it anytime to save money today and because it stores for 25 years, you're locking in today's prices and avoiding the rising food cost.
[07:47.000 --> 07:53.000]  Don't wait. Call 800-409-5633 or go to eFoodsDirect.com forward slash Alex.
[07:53.000 --> 08:18.000]  Call 800-409-5633 or eFoodsDirect.com forward slash Alex. You can bet your life on eFoods direct.
[08:24.000 --> 08:40.000]  These are our people. Who are they? They are the Dark Armies. The Dark Murdering Armies use only honor as atrocities.
[08:40.000 --> 08:50.000]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[08:50.000 --> 08:57.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[08:57.000 --> 09:05.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is the 27th day already of September 2012.
[09:05.000 --> 09:12.000]  I'm Alex Jones, your host. We're going to be here Lord Willen as we are Monday through Friday, 12 noon to 3 p.m. Eastern.
[09:12.000 --> 09:20.000]  Blasting out on XM-166. Shyamal Casting on over 120 AM and FM affiliates now.
[09:20.000 --> 09:28.000]  And also streaming over the web at infowars.com with the free audio streams and podcasts as well as prisonplanet.com.
[09:28.000 --> 09:39.000]  And then, of course, the video site with all my films and the live video streams of The Daily Radio Show as well as the nightly news, prisonplanet.tv.
[09:39.000 --> 09:49.000]  Wow, where to start today? Let me just go over some of the stacks that I have here in front of me.
[09:49.000 --> 09:52.000]  David Icke is joining us for the next hour, always thought-provoking.
[09:52.000 --> 09:58.000]  Then we have the thought criminal, Amy Larson, arrested for writing a political message on the sidewalk.
[09:58.000 --> 10:03.000]  Of course, it will all be selectively enforced. Your children will not be arrested for playing hopscotch.
[10:03.000 --> 10:12.000]  At least not. Well, that's not actually true. There are resting parents everywhere for their kids playing on the sidewalk in a cul-de-sac or even in a rural area in a cul-de-sac or the backyard.
[10:12.000 --> 10:15.000]  Actually, I'm sorry, they will arrest your children.
[10:15.000 --> 10:26.000]  But the megabanks will own the big pharma companies on record putting HIV and the factor rate for Bayer and cancer viruses like SV-40 and your major vaccines.
[10:26.000 --> 10:33.000]  So they will murder you and ship narcotics in and have the troops publicly grow it in front of you on television.
[10:33.000 --> 10:36.000]  But tell you, they're going to put you in jail if they catch you using it.
[10:36.000 --> 10:40.000]  Because we live in total law-law land. Excuse me, I'm going to settle down right now.
[10:40.000 --> 10:48.000]  Excuse me, really angry when I see the absolute attack on free speech ahead of the total collapse by design.
[10:48.000 --> 10:57.000]  I don't like telling you, you sit down and you shut up. We'll have the Pentagon arrest you if you peacefully protest at the DNC.
[10:57.000 --> 11:07.000]  And the Department of Defense will be there at the local courthouse telling the judge, don't let them out of jail, protestings quote, low-level terrorism.
[11:07.000 --> 11:13.000]  Remember that three weeks ago, I just can't get over it. And it's not even a media issue.
[11:13.000 --> 11:18.000]  ACLU covers it and it's in a few newspapers like, yeah, the Department of Defense wants everybody arrested.
[11:18.000 --> 11:24.000]  You know, the military operates on the streets now and Paul Joseph Watson's got an article here.
[11:24.000 --> 11:30.000]  LRAD's sonic weapons to be deployed throughout America for crisis.
[11:30.000 --> 11:39.000]  And he has a link to government security news breaking that down along with high-powered microwave guns.
[11:39.000 --> 11:53.000]  Of course, they don't care of people like Rob Do, my nightly news chief, got arrested at the G20 in 2009 for standing on a hill at a university,
[11:53.000 --> 11:57.000]  filming police beating peaceful, not even protesters.
[11:57.000 --> 12:00.000]  No one was even daring to go outside the curfew.
[12:00.000 --> 12:11.000]  So they went five miles away to the university and went into the park as people were eating, you know, bologna sandwiches and reading on their laptops and said,
[12:11.000 --> 12:15.000]  everyone must disperse. So when they tried to disperse, they had every exit blocked.
[12:15.000 --> 12:21.000]  It was just a beta test to see if cops would attack innocent people under federal and globalist command.
[12:21.000 --> 12:26.000]  Actually, G20 was commanding them, so a foreign corporate government was.
[12:26.000 --> 12:32.000]  They had G20 and U.S. Army uniforms. This was on the news. Jumping out of cars, just type in G20, snatch and grab.
[12:32.000 --> 12:35.000]  It's the same in Europe and in Canada. They did the same thing.
[12:35.000 --> 12:42.000]  Grabbing them and dragging them into cars in front of everyone to set that precedent.
[12:42.000 --> 12:45.000]  And the national media was like, yeah, there's some guys. We don't know who they are.
[12:45.000 --> 12:48.000]  Grabbing people and throwing them into cars and disappearing them.
[12:48.000 --> 12:51.000]  But well, what's the big deal?
[12:51.000 --> 12:55.000]  I mean, you know, 27 years ago Tiananmen Square was a big deal when tanks ran over people.
[12:55.000 --> 13:00.000]  Now when tanks and steamrollers do it, the Drudge Report picks it up.
[13:00.000 --> 13:03.000]  DrudgeReport.com picks it up.
[13:03.000 --> 13:08.000]  And then that kind of made the Daily Mail and New York Daily News do it, but only because Drudge picked it up.
[13:08.000 --> 13:15.000]  And you would have thought that had been on every news channel in the country, you know, running over people with steamrollers.
[13:15.000 --> 13:22.000]  But no, no, instead I saw the comments in the New York Daily News going, you know what, you shouldn't be protesting.
[13:22.000 --> 13:32.000]  Let me ask the cops a question. Do you really want to live in a country where you can't write a political message on the sidewalk with chalk?
[13:32.000 --> 13:41.000]  Do you really want to live in a country where the TSA is hiring felons on purpose to play ping pong in your pants?
[13:41.000 --> 13:45.000]  Do you really, I mean, you think this is going to be a good future?
[13:45.000 --> 13:49.000]  And I talked to the police all day because, hey, you could say no like in Romania.
[13:49.000 --> 13:53.000]  They said no to Celsius. Or you could say no like they tried to against Hitler.
[13:53.000 --> 13:57.000]  Or you could say no like in many cases it's been successful.
[13:57.000 --> 14:02.000]  That's why they're going to autonomous ground robots and autonomous drones because they want to get you out of the equation.
[14:02.000 --> 14:08.000]  But you have been turned into a standing military army here and they are engineering this collapse and we've been proven right.
[14:08.000 --> 14:13.000]  So I know in the past they tried to hire people that were smart to be cops.
[14:13.000 --> 14:16.000]  Now they want to hire you because you're stupid the last 25 years or so.
[14:16.000 --> 14:24.000]  I believe you're smart enough to understand that tyranny is not cute and it's not fun.
[14:24.000 --> 14:31.000]  So I do routinely speak to you and try to speak your common sense conscience.
[14:31.000 --> 14:35.000]  But the police are not at fault for what's happening in this country.
[14:35.000 --> 14:44.000]  If you want to know why we are in this much trouble, the social engineers for the last 100 years run by people like Edward Bernays,
[14:44.000 --> 14:51.000]  who literally is the father of modern propaganda, turned us into arrested development children.
[14:51.000 --> 14:55.000]  And with the advent of television they have scrambled our minds, destroyed critical thinking,
[14:55.000 --> 15:00.000]  and turned the public into a group of basically biological androids who are programmable
[15:00.000 --> 15:04.000]  and who don't have an original thought in their little brains.
[15:04.000 --> 15:09.000]  And police and bureaucrats are just pulled from that general pool.
[15:09.000 --> 15:15.000]  But I want to ask people something, because I see it in the comments and things on news sites,
[15:15.000 --> 15:20.000]  when they defend that you can't have a garden in your backyard even though it's not even a zone that you can't,
[15:20.000 --> 15:28.000]  or they defend shooting some guy that had 20 chickens in his backyard and had them for 30 years in Georgia,
[15:28.000 --> 15:32.000]  or when they defend forced inoculations when it's not even the law,
[15:32.000 --> 15:39.000]  those of you that defend the system, those of you before I go to the news that think all of this is cute and great
[15:39.000 --> 15:49.000]  and it's for a greater good and who believe the government is loving and helpful,
[15:49.000 --> 15:58.000]  you don't believe it's malevolent, you believe that it's here to help everybody.
[15:58.000 --> 16:06.000]  I would like to open the phones up for people that not even so much disagree.
[16:06.000 --> 16:12.000]  I mean, that's a standard deal is you work for the Vatican, you work for the Saudis,
[16:12.000 --> 16:15.000]  you work for Israel, you work for the Easter Bunny.
[16:15.000 --> 16:22.000]  Those little kind of memes put out by the CIA and other groups.
[16:22.000 --> 16:31.000]  I want to hear from people who specifically really do believe in all this.
[16:31.000 --> 16:37.000]  I want to hear from those of you that are mad at me and have said that I need to be arrested as a meme
[16:37.000 --> 16:44.000]  because I talk about government stage terror from 9-11 to the USS Liberty to the Gulf of Tonkin
[16:44.000 --> 16:52.000]  to Operation Ajax, Operation Gladio, the NATO option, Operation Northwoods.
[16:52.000 --> 16:57.000]  I really want to hear from you because later when David Ikson with us, I'm going to play this clip,
[16:57.000 --> 17:01.000]  lobbyist, launch stage provocation start war with Iran.
[17:01.000 --> 17:05.000]  It's a minute and a half clip, a little over a minute and a half long,
[17:05.000 --> 17:13.000]  and it's former chief economist at the IMF and World Bank, senior economist,
[17:13.000 --> 17:18.000]  the Washington Institute for Near East Policy from a luncheon on C-SPAN
[17:18.000 --> 17:24.000]  how to build US-Israeli coordination on preventing an Iranian nuclear breakout.
[17:24.000 --> 17:28.000]  And he said, hey, we've had other staged events, we should just get a war started.
[17:28.000 --> 17:30.000]  I mean, I played the clip.
[17:30.000 --> 17:36.000]  And I noticed on YouTube, some people were saying, yeah, we need to stage something Iran's so bad.
[17:36.000 --> 17:42.000]  So you're now saying we need to blow up a ship, pull a US Navy personnel
[17:42.000 --> 17:47.000]  and then all get angry and then go blow Iran up because the end justifies the means.
[17:47.000 --> 17:50.000]  And then others were saying, oh, my gosh, this is terrible.
[17:50.000 --> 17:52.000]  Oh, my gosh, this is horrible.
[17:52.000 --> 17:54.000]  You know, this means the 9-11 truthers are right.
[17:54.000 --> 17:56.000]  This is just terrible.
[17:56.000 --> 18:01.000]  But still others were like, this is out of context.
[18:01.000 --> 18:05.000]  Even though it's standard neocon and even Gary Hart is not a neocon.
[18:05.000 --> 18:07.000]  He wrote a letter document five years ago.
[18:07.000 --> 18:09.000]  Just type in his letter document.
[18:09.000 --> 18:11.000]  Gary Hart's letter document.
[18:11.000 --> 18:13.000]  It's on the Huffington Post right now.
[18:13.000 --> 18:17.000]  Guys, just type it in and show people we're watching on prisonplanet.tv.
[18:17.000 --> 18:18.000]  I saw him saying this.
[18:18.000 --> 18:19.000]  This has been edited.
[18:19.000 --> 18:25.000]  Well, right under the clip on YouTube is a link to their YouTube site, the policy groups site,
[18:25.000 --> 18:28.000]  with the whole hour 45 minute thing.
[18:28.000 --> 18:30.000]  And it's even worse.
[18:30.000 --> 18:35.000]  I got home late last night, but still went and watched most of it.
[18:35.000 --> 18:37.000]  It's just a goldmine of evil.
[18:37.000 --> 18:41.000]  I mean, you're talking about criminal admissions on television.
[18:41.000 --> 18:44.000]  Of, yeah, we need to blow something up and blame it on them.
[18:44.000 --> 18:46.000]  Everybody's like, yeah, yeah.
[18:46.000 --> 18:51.000]  And then the public can't even believe it when they're seeing it.
[18:51.000 --> 18:53.000]  We didn't get a war started.
[18:53.000 --> 18:56.000]  You know, our government's blown stuff up before blaming all the people.
[18:56.000 --> 19:01.000]  Everybody's like, yeah, you're laughing.
[19:01.000 --> 19:10.000]  And then I'm supposed to see this and see all this unfolding and just go along with it and say,
[19:10.000 --> 19:12.000]  oh, there's no such thing as a false flag.
[19:12.000 --> 19:22.000]  So here is the toll free number to join us if you think it's good to have the government kill people
[19:22.000 --> 19:24.000]  and then blame it on somebody.
[19:24.000 --> 19:29.000]  And then I'm bad and a conspiracy theorist when I point out that this is being said and promoted.
[19:29.000 --> 19:34.000]  Now, I raise this because we got an email back.
[19:34.000 --> 19:40.000]  We sent one off to this policy institute to try to get this gentleman on.
[19:40.000 --> 19:43.000]  And I'll show the email and we get back and read it.
[19:43.000 --> 19:46.000]  And they said, this is a setup for Patrick to be crucified.
[19:46.000 --> 19:50.000]  We need to be careful of these requests going forward.
[19:50.000 --> 19:53.000]  Can't wait for reporters to ask you about your comments, buddy.
[19:53.000 --> 19:55.000]  We're going to get to the economy a lot more.
[19:55.000 --> 19:57.000]  I'll give you the number to call in when we get back.
[19:57.000 --> 19:59.000]  Stay with us.
[20:28.000 --> 20:30.000]  Even today, Japanese eat miso.
[20:30.000 --> 20:32.000]  Africans eat fermented porges.
[20:32.000 --> 20:33.000]  Koreans eat kimchi.
[20:33.000 --> 20:36.000]  And in India, fermented milk is a staple for healthy living.
[20:36.000 --> 20:37.000]  But here's some good news.
[20:37.000 --> 20:43.000]  South for Lion Americans can now discover the secrets to making these amazing fermented foods legally and privately in their own homes.
[20:43.000 --> 20:46.000]  Since it's still legal to make these foods as long as you can make them yourself.

[24:11.000 --> 24:22.000]  People say, what does that mean? Don't worry, this show is documented. I mean that's what's scary about it. No, we are documenting the tyranny and we will defeat it.
[24:22.000 --> 24:29.000]  Don't worry, the good guys always win in the end. Here's the article from the Huffington Post right here.
[24:29.000 --> 24:39.000]  It's titled Unsolicited Advice to the Government of Iran. And Gary Hart wrote this a few years ago and he goes on to say, we will stage terrorism.
[24:39.000 --> 24:49.000]  And blame it on you, so look out. Well, we now have this lobbyist speaking at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy on C-SPAN.
[24:49.000 --> 24:58.000]  On C-SPAN, the director of research, Patrick Klosson, coming out and saying, we need to go ahead and just start a war.
[24:58.000 --> 25:04.000]  And we need to go ahead and use a provocation. And then he laughs. No, I'm not advocating that. It's like a double speak deal.
[25:04.000 --> 25:09.000]  Because they know this is treason, this is crimes that are being called for. I mean, it's a big deal.
[25:09.000 --> 25:19.000]  So if there is a big stage terror attack, I mean, a city gets nuked, a U.S. ship gets blown up, it could run the gamut from bad to really bad to catastrophic.
[25:19.000 --> 25:24.000]  I will be attacked when I come out on air and say, we should look at this as an inside job.
[25:24.000 --> 25:38.000]  If Obama stages something before the election, a mass shooting, a bombing in Oklahoma City, we've got five of his advisors in newspapers saying, we need a new Oklahoma City or 9-11 to be blamed on our enemies, conservatives, libertarians.
[25:38.000 --> 25:43.000]  My point is governments all do this throughout history when they're corrupt. It's par for the course.
[25:43.000 --> 25:53.000]  Hitler did it with Operation Hemler, subgroup Operation Gliwitz. The Reichstag was a Reichstag event, was a false flag event, a self-inflicted wound, a set up, a frame up.
[25:53.000 --> 26:01.000]  And the fact that we get demonized when we're like, hey, these guys write books, calling for this stuff, hey, they stand again.
[26:01.000 --> 26:09.000]  Hey, I've got eyewitnesses, police officers that saw the feds in there with the bombs at Oklahoma City.
[26:09.000 --> 26:17.000]  I mean, I've had cops on where the feds came in their offices and said, I will kill you and your wife if you tell anybody what you saw.
[26:17.000 --> 26:27.000]  And then they even named names. I mean, this is not fun, ladies and gentlemen. Fast and furious was a false flag.
[26:27.000 --> 26:33.000]  It's not fun getting up here and risking my life to expose this, but we've got to do it.
[26:33.000 --> 26:43.000]  I mean, think of how dumb they think we are, how dumb they think you are, that they write books and declassified memos.
[26:43.000 --> 26:59.000]  And it's now been declassified that Bobby Kennedy wanted to blow up the U.S. Embassy in Caracas to blame it on political enemies and his brother overruled him.
[26:59.000 --> 27:06.000]  That's right, out of the Godfather, where the brothers disagree with the family and then the establishment moves in against the dad or the other brother.
[27:06.000 --> 27:08.000]  Think of the younger brother, he'll work with them.
[27:08.000 --> 27:14.000]  Of course, then he'd woke up and didn't work with them, so they killed him. But Bobby was actually playing patty cake right along with them.
[27:14.000 --> 27:23.000]  With Lemn and Sir and others that wanted to attack U.S. cities and blow up movie theaters, shoot up movie theaters to get a war going with the Soviets.
[27:23.000 --> 27:31.000]  And people say, well, Alex, Northwoods is real. What are you, pro-Soviet? You don't want to blow up movie theaters in America?
[27:31.000 --> 27:42.000]  What, become what the Soviets are? To fight the Soviets? No thanks. Wear the ring of Mordor to defeat Sauron? No, thank you.
[27:42.000 --> 27:51.000]  You don't become Methodophiles, Bathomets, Satan, Diablo, the old serpent.
[27:51.000 --> 28:08.000]  You don't become El Diablo to fight the devil. And I don't know how we've gotten to the point where even mainline police all over the country, everywhere, get caught at the crime labs framing innocent people knowingly.
[28:08.000 --> 28:18.000]  Not even framing people they think are guilty, just not caring. Prosecutors are constantly getting caught, you see it, sending innocent people to jail just so they can have a perfect conviction record.
[28:18.000 --> 28:30.000]  Police are caught dressing up like protesters and engaging in crimes so they can attack the peaceful protesters. Man, I mean, that is just bad mojo.
[28:30.000 --> 28:38.000]  Here's the toll-free number to join us. I want your take on this if you like the system and you think I'm wrong. That's who the phones are open for.
[28:38.000 --> 28:52.000]  800-259-9231. 800-259-9231. But here is the email. You guys can even show this if you want on the document cam for prisonplanet.tv viewers.
[28:52.000 --> 28:58.000]  Jeff Rubin at thewashingtoninstitute.org. J. Rubin at washingtoninstitute.org.
[28:58.000 --> 29:08.000]  He sent a very nice polite email which everybody can see right here.
[29:08.000 --> 29:19.000]  And so we like to invite him on to talk about his talk on C-Span. And this is what they sent back to us but also C-Seed to the other people.
[29:19.000 --> 29:26.000]  This is a setup for Patrick to be crucified. We need to be careful of these requests going forward.
[29:26.000 --> 29:31.000]  Well, no, no, no. You already crucified yourself with your arrogance on C-Span.
[29:31.000 --> 29:37.000]  You guys sit around behind closed doors all day and talk like this. You think we're all just totally brain damage from the fluoride.
[29:37.000 --> 29:43.000]  And we're close but not completely. Maybe you are a little bit, you guys thinking you can shoot your mouths off like this.
[29:43.000 --> 29:49.000]  So we're going to hammer on this a lot more now. 800-259-9231.
[29:49.000 --> 29:57.000]  We're on the march. The Empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[30:20.000 --> 30:28.000]  There's no priming required. It's NSF 42 certified. Optional fluoride filters can reduce fluoride up to 95%.
[30:28.000 --> 30:34.000]  Easy to set up and use. Doesn't require electricity. Purify water from lake streams, ponds and wells.
[30:34.000 --> 30:42.000]  This filter system leaves in beneficial minerals which is key. Save money by not buying bottled water and avoid BPA that leaches from the plastic.
[30:42.000 --> 30:49.000]  Propyr is the best gravity-fed filter out there. It's what my family uses. Infowars.com already has the lowest price on Propyr.
[30:49.000 --> 30:55.000]  But if you add the promo code WATER at checkout, you get an additional 10% off at Infowars.com.
[30:55.000 --> 31:00.000]  You can also call to order 888-253-3139.
[31:00.000 --> 31:05.000]  For thousands of years, silver has been used as both a medicine and a preservative. But not all silver is equal.
[31:05.000 --> 31:12.000]  Silver Soul is an amazing new technology that has been clinically shown to be several hundred times more effective than colloid or ionic silvers.
[31:12.000 --> 31:16.000]  It can destroy thousands of times more pathogens than older silver technology.
[31:16.000 --> 31:24.000]  Silver Soul resonates at the same frequency as germicidal light used in labs to kill bacteria and viruses, enabling it to kill without direct contact.
[31:24.000 --> 31:31.000]  Silver Soul is a broad-spectrum microbial that creates no resistance and does not harm beneficial bacteria, making it ideal for daily use.
[31:31.000 --> 31:37.000]  It can be used internally as well as topically, and is highly effective against viruses, bacteria, molds, and yeasts.
[31:37.000 --> 31:43.000]  With threats like West Nile virus, colds, flus, or any other emergency situation, arm yourself with Supernatural Silver.

[33:17.000 --> 33:46.000]  We are back live, ladies and gentlemen.
[33:46.000 --> 33:52.000]  Okay, let me mention some of the other headlines and news we're going to be covering in the next few hours here.
[33:52.000 --> 33:56.000]  And some of our other top stories and then I will start going to your phone calls.
[33:56.000 --> 34:02.000]  You know, I have a digital phone system here at my offices, our studios in Austin, Texas,
[34:02.000 --> 34:07.000]  that I can open up and take over 100 phone calls at one time.
[34:07.000 --> 34:12.000]  And we can get 100 calls to come in in 60 seconds.
[34:12.000 --> 34:15.000]  I mean, I hear national shows begging for phone calls.
[34:15.000 --> 34:19.000]  Of course, we also don't screen your calls.
[34:19.000 --> 34:20.000]  So sometimes they're incredible.
[34:20.000 --> 34:22.000]  Other times they're absolutely horrible.
[34:22.000 --> 34:25.000]  And the person sounds like, you know, they've had half a bottle of Jack Daniels
[34:25.000 --> 34:31.000]  and five or six Heal Billy heroines or OxyCottons on top of it.
[34:31.000 --> 34:36.000]  But I noticed that whenever I give people a chance to call in and disagree,
[34:36.000 --> 34:40.000]  we've got two callers on the line right now that disagree with me.
[34:40.000 --> 34:42.000]  And I can bet money.
[34:42.000 --> 34:46.000]  It's going to be about me personally or a made up conspiracy theory,
[34:46.000 --> 34:49.000]  which is a conspiracy theory with no proof that I'm this or that,
[34:49.000 --> 34:52.000]  because they can't attack the information I'm putting out.
[34:52.000 --> 34:58.000]  I want to hear from people who actually believe in the nanny state
[34:58.000 --> 35:01.000]  and actually believe that you should arrest mothers and fathers
[35:01.000 --> 35:04.000]  who let their children play on the sidewalk.
[35:04.000 --> 35:08.000]  You actually believe that it's okay that government outside of law is engaging
[35:08.000 --> 35:09.000]  in forced inoculations.
[35:09.000 --> 35:11.000]  That's who I'd like to hear from.
[35:11.000 --> 35:17.000]  I'd like to hear from people that think it's okay to have a big Israel lobby,
[35:17.000 --> 35:22.000]  kind of a neocon angle, because Israel isn't one monolith,
[35:22.000 --> 35:25.000]  promoting a false flag, a staged event.
[35:25.000 --> 35:27.000]  Go watch the video at infowarch.com.
[35:27.000 --> 35:31.000]  Lobbyist launched stage provocation to start war with Iran.
[35:31.000 --> 35:35.000]  We are in the game of using covert means against the Iranians.
[35:35.000 --> 35:39.000]  And then he goes through all these quotes about starting a war.
[35:39.000 --> 35:44.000]  And to a variety of things, you know, the Gulf of Tonkin, on and on and on.
[35:44.000 --> 35:46.000]  So there it is.
[35:46.000 --> 35:48.000]  I want to know your take on that.
[35:48.000 --> 35:52.000]  I mean, do we get an apology for talking about false flags?
[35:52.000 --> 35:55.000]  And then we've been attacked saying it doesn't exist.
[35:55.000 --> 35:57.000]  Governments don't stage provocations,
[35:57.000 --> 36:01.000]  even though they're historical facts back to the time of Rome.
[36:01.000 --> 36:04.000]  No, of course we don't get apologies from those of you out there.
[36:04.000 --> 36:08.000]  As fast and furious was a false flag to blame the Second Amendment.
[36:08.000 --> 36:11.000]  I mean, this false flag thing, this staged terror deal,
[36:11.000 --> 36:14.000]  is at the heart of corrupt government.
[36:14.000 --> 36:17.000]  And that's why I spend so much time exposing it.
[36:17.000 --> 36:21.000]  Do you think I was happy ten and a half years ago to be on over 100 stations?
[36:21.000 --> 36:25.000]  I'd already was breaking into radio, incredible success,
[36:25.000 --> 36:27.000]  and then 9-11 happened.
[36:27.000 --> 36:29.000]  And because Bill Clinton had been in office,
[36:29.000 --> 36:31.000]  I was bashing Bill Clinton, obviously, because I didn't like him.
[36:31.000 --> 36:33.000]  He was a globalist, and Bush got in,
[36:33.000 --> 36:35.000]  and I was kind of like, well, we'll see what he does.
[36:35.000 --> 36:37.000]  And then 9-11 happened, and it was clearly a false flag,
[36:37.000 --> 36:40.000]  because I heard him say they blew up Building 7 that day on the news,
[36:40.000 --> 36:45.000]  and then I was told I was a conspiracy theorist and didn't hear and see that.
[36:45.000 --> 36:49.000]  And it was not fun to lose 70-plus percent of my affiliates.
[36:49.000 --> 36:55.000]  I will assure you, but it had to be done because I had to tell the truth.
[36:55.000 --> 36:58.000]  So see, I had everything to lose to go on air and talk about that,
[36:58.000 --> 37:01.000]  but I did because it's a fact.
[37:01.000 --> 37:06.000]  And now you got these people on television talking about staging stuff.
[37:06.000 --> 37:10.000]  You got Obama's people talking about staging stuff in newspapers and on TV,
[37:10.000 --> 37:13.000]  and blaming it on constitutionalists and gun owners.
[37:13.000 --> 37:17.000]  And I'm not going to sit here like I didn't hear them say it.
[37:17.000 --> 37:20.000]  They're like, it's politically incorrect to say government stages stuff.
[37:20.000 --> 37:22.000]  Now, let's stage some stuff.
[37:22.000 --> 37:23.000]  Hey, you just said stage stuff.
[37:23.000 --> 37:24.000]  No, I didn't.
[37:24.000 --> 37:25.000]  No, I didn't cook.
[37:25.000 --> 37:26.000]  Let's stage stuff.
[37:26.000 --> 37:27.000]  Let's stage stuff.
[37:27.000 --> 37:28.000]  Hey, you just said it again.
[37:28.000 --> 37:29.000]  No, I didn't.
[37:29.000 --> 37:30.000]  No, I didn't conspiracy theorist.
[37:30.000 --> 37:31.000]  Hey, I heard you just say it.
[37:31.000 --> 37:35.000]  They play these games with us, man, and I'm done.
[37:35.000 --> 37:39.000]  Now, coming up, you see this kind of news every day.
[37:39.000 --> 37:41.000]  Every day, if I go look, it's there.
[37:41.000 --> 37:43.000]  Without looking, I see it every three or four days.
[37:43.000 --> 37:45.000]  ABC News.
[37:45.000 --> 37:51.000]  ABC News tracks missing iPad to Florida home of TSA officer.
[37:51.000 --> 37:52.000]  They're not officers.
[37:52.000 --> 37:58.000]  They get two weeks of training, an extra week of training or less to read your mind.
[37:58.000 --> 38:00.000]  Just total quack them.
[38:00.000 --> 38:11.000]  Total baloney, total bunk, total boulder dash, poppycock, whatever you want to call it, garbage, lies, deception, fraud, scam.
[38:11.000 --> 38:18.000]  ABC News tracks missing iPad to Florida home of TSA officer.
[38:18.000 --> 38:21.000]  Everybody I know said the TSA steal something from him.
[38:21.000 --> 38:23.000]  Dr. Pachynica, we've been asking back on the show.
[38:23.000 --> 38:24.000]  We're getting close to that.
[38:24.000 --> 38:29.000]  He said he had his schedule three sleeping pills stolen.
[38:29.000 --> 38:33.000]  I had a baby toy stolen, a little teething ring.
[38:33.000 --> 38:37.000]  They didn't like the other Tiffany stuff I bought, my newborn daughter.
[38:37.000 --> 38:38.000]  This is like seven years ago.
[38:38.000 --> 38:41.000]  They wanted that.
[38:41.000 --> 38:44.000]  They wanted that.
[38:44.000 --> 38:46.000]  And they opened the little present and stole it.
[38:46.000 --> 38:49.000]  And it's just incredible theft.
[38:49.000 --> 38:50.000]  I mean, they just steal everything.
[38:50.000 --> 38:52.000]  They hit on good-looking women or their pedos.
[38:52.000 --> 38:53.000]  They go after your kid.
[38:53.000 --> 38:57.000]  Some of them are just sadists that like to rip colostomy bags off old ladies.
[38:57.000 --> 39:01.000]  Then they lie and say, we don't strip search old ladies and get caught doing it.
[39:01.000 --> 39:04.000]  They say, we don't go outside your pants and they get videotaped doing it.
[39:04.000 --> 39:05.000]  We don't go in your pants.
[39:05.000 --> 39:06.000]  There's no radiation.
[39:06.000 --> 39:08.000]  It's been tested and shown to be safe.
[39:08.000 --> 39:10.000]  That's shown to be a total lie.
[39:10.000 --> 39:13.000]  Federal court orders them to release the studies.
[39:13.000 --> 39:15.000]  Then they won't.
[39:15.000 --> 39:20.000]  Investigation reveals 381 TSA officers fired for theft from passengers.
[39:20.000 --> 39:22.000]  Agency cites zero tolerance.
[39:22.000 --> 39:26.000]  In the latest apparent case of what must have hundreds of thefts by TSA officers.
[39:26.000 --> 39:27.000]  That's a lie.
[39:27.000 --> 39:33.000]  Of passengers' belongings, an iPad left behind a security checkpoint in Orlando Airport was
[39:33.000 --> 39:40.000]  tracked as it moved 30 miles to the home of TSA officer and mayors are authorities and
[39:40.000 --> 39:41.000]  we are civilians.
[39:41.000 --> 39:43.000]  Notice all the nomenclature.
[39:43.000 --> 39:46.000]  Last scene handling it.
[39:46.000 --> 39:49.000]  And they're confronted by the ABC News.
[39:49.000 --> 39:53.000]  The officer, Andy Ramirez, at first tonight having the missing iPad.
[39:53.000 --> 39:54.000]  It goes on.
[39:54.000 --> 39:57.000]  Speaking of that, we'll get to this more after.
[39:57.000 --> 40:02.000]  Guys, will you pull me Paul Watson's article from yesterday that I never got to that's
[40:02.000 --> 40:06.000]  a big deal about our national call to film the TSA?
[40:06.000 --> 40:09.000]  Will you print me that national film the TSA week announced?
[40:09.000 --> 40:10.000]  Will you print me that?
[40:10.000 --> 40:11.000]  Thank you.
[40:11.000 --> 40:14.000]  So I want to cover that later when I get back into this.
[40:14.000 --> 40:20.000]  Now there's a new bizarre TSA freeze security drill caught on tape.
[40:20.000 --> 40:24.000]  At first they denied they were doing this freeze thing just like they denied they were checking
[40:24.000 --> 40:27.000]  people's waters and coffees they buy past the checkpoints.
[40:27.000 --> 40:28.000]  Now that's confirmed.
[40:28.000 --> 40:31.000]  They had denied the freeze drill.
[40:31.000 --> 40:35.000]  Now it's on video and the story is halfway down the right hand side of drudgereport.com.
[40:35.000 --> 40:40.000]  It's by Paul Joseph Watson at infowars.com and prisonplanet.com.
[40:40.000 --> 40:46.000]  Bizarre TSA freeze security drill caught on camera, pointless policy, little more than
[40:46.000 --> 40:47.000]  obedience training.
[40:47.000 --> 40:52.000]  Well yeah we have TSA on video saying I'm not letting you fly because I didn't like your
[40:52.000 --> 40:53.000]  tone of voice.
[40:53.000 --> 40:55.000]  It's all about I'm somebody.
[40:55.000 --> 40:57.000]  You know when they beat their chest and say I have power.
[40:57.000 --> 40:58.000]  That's on video.
[40:58.000 --> 40:59.000]  I have power.
[40:59.000 --> 41:03.000]  Others stripped down naked and announced their gods start running around others rape women
[41:03.000 --> 41:04.000]  in the parking lot.
[41:04.000 --> 41:07.000]  I mean this is just nobody.
[41:07.000 --> 41:12.000]  Many of them literally couldn't get a job picking up 10 cans and they now are going to get their
[41:12.000 --> 41:14.000]  hands down your wise pants.
[41:14.000 --> 41:16.000]  Miss USA, we're going in your pants babe.
[41:16.000 --> 41:20.000]  The Pete Owens, they like your 5 year old daughter.
[41:20.000 --> 41:22.000]  It's game on.
[41:22.000 --> 41:24.000]  And then we're the bad evil.
[41:24.000 --> 41:28.000]  We're just trying to keep you safe from Al Qaeda that the government publicly runs and
[41:28.000 --> 41:32.000]  publicly got the underwear bomber on the plane and shirt off makes money off the body
[41:32.000 --> 41:35.000]  scanners and on and on and on and on.
[41:35.000 --> 41:40.000]  So we're going to be getting into all that in the huge economic news but you know I said
[41:40.000 --> 41:44.000]  I'd go to people that disagree and we're going to get to economic news in the next segment
[41:44.000 --> 41:48.000]  and it's big in Europe and it's going according to globalist plan.
[41:48.000 --> 41:52.000]  Let's go just in order that they were received.
[41:52.000 --> 41:55.000]  Eric in North Carolina who disagrees you're on the air.
[41:55.000 --> 41:57.000]  Hey Alex, I'm actually a pretty big fan.
[41:57.000 --> 42:01.000]  Agree with a lot of what you say but there's one subject you're consistently dead wrong
[42:01.000 --> 42:04.000]  on and that's your defense of Stephen Hatfield.
[42:04.000 --> 42:07.000]  I can promise you he mailed the anthrax letters.
[42:07.000 --> 42:09.000]  I'm the man that called him.
[42:09.000 --> 42:15.000]  Agent Eric Davis at the Charlotte FBI Stephen Hatfield's last name which I read off his
[42:15.000 --> 42:20.000]  army jacket as he stalked my house out here in the middle of nowhere in North Carolina
[42:20.000 --> 42:24.000]  seven months before Stephen Hatfield became a TV household name.
[42:24.000 --> 42:28.000]  Well sir you need to obviously I'm not omnipresent and don't know everything.
[42:28.000 --> 42:34.000]  I know that quite a few Patsy's got charged just like Richard Joule was a Patsy for you know
[42:34.000 --> 42:43.000]  the bombing at Olympic Park and I know that they killed the last Patsy and the media did
[42:43.000 --> 42:46.000]  you know when they said he committed suicide they even point out he was in federal custody
[42:46.000 --> 42:50.000]  when he supposedly took the prescription Tylenol.
[42:50.000 --> 42:54.000]  So I would love for you to send me a letter with this written up with your credentials
[42:54.000 --> 42:59.000]  and what your proof is and I would love to see that information.
[42:59.000 --> 43:04.000]  But on the air but I never got any kind of response I know you guys probably get flooded with emails.
[43:04.000 --> 43:06.000]  I would be glad to send you my stuff.
[43:06.000 --> 43:09.000]  I have FOIA requests that I have had answered.
[43:09.000 --> 43:14.000]  I still actually I'll be totally honest with you because it was covered up by Special Agent Jim Page
[43:14.000 --> 43:16.000]  and Agent Eric Davis.
[43:16.000 --> 43:19.000]  I still have anthrax that was mailed to me.
[43:19.000 --> 43:25.000]  And anybody out there on your show can go Google Westgate Postal Facility which serves all mail.
[43:25.000 --> 43:30.000]  Listen listen here's the deal. You say you tried to contact us send us a letter
[43:30.000 --> 43:37.000]  you know saying you know give to Alex Jones you know this concerns the anthrax case.
[43:37.000 --> 43:41.000]  I would really want to talk to you and I appreciate your call sir.
[43:41.000 --> 43:45.000]  I mean here's an example just briefly of what I'm talking about here.
[43:45.000 --> 43:51.000]  This morning I'm on infowarsh.com and prisonblood.com and I like to scan comments because I get good points
[43:51.000 --> 43:55.000]  and you know things mentioned by listeners.
[43:55.000 --> 44:01.000]  But almost always when something's being recommended to me it's like why isn't the Scum Trader covering this?
[44:01.000 --> 44:04.000]  Because I didn't know.
[44:04.000 --> 44:10.000]  But more often than not I was on YouTube and on my site going the Scum Jones won't cover the lobbyists
[44:10.000 --> 44:14.000]  saying launch stage provocation to start war with Iran.
[44:14.000 --> 44:19.000]  We had an article yesterday morning we broke that story from nowhere on YouTube.
[44:19.000 --> 44:24.000]  I covered it for like an hour I'm covering it now but if someone sees any article
[44:24.000 --> 44:33.000]  you know if I have an article about humanless you know computer driven cars in California being approved
[44:33.000 --> 44:38.000]  I see a comment and they're going you trash you're not covering this and it's almost like
[44:38.000 --> 44:42.000]  it's like the public's so dumbed down they've awoken to the government's evil
[44:42.000 --> 44:48.000]  but they still have no navigation skills of you know I'm driving over that hill over there
[44:48.000 --> 44:53.000]  and you drive over the hill and go I see a red fire engine they lied to me it didn't tell me it was a red fire engine
[44:53.000 --> 44:56.000]  it's like we didn't know it was a red fire engine over the hill.
[44:56.000 --> 45:02.000]  I mean it's just it's like really weird because that's the most common criticism I get is why aren't you covering this?
[45:02.000 --> 45:04.000]  Why aren't you covering that?
[45:04.000 --> 45:06.000]  Why aren't you going over this?
[45:06.000 --> 45:07.000]  Why aren't you going over that?
[45:07.000 --> 45:12.000]  It's like I didn't know about it or I get busy and it just it's so much.
[45:12.000 --> 45:16.000]  Here's the message it isn't about Alex Jones.
[45:16.000 --> 45:24.000]  I'm a guy who loves liberty like you do and if you have all this evidence you should turn a camera on
[45:24.000 --> 45:29.000]  show the documents and shoot a YouTube video and then I can go spot check some of your documents
[45:29.000 --> 45:35.000]  instead of you mailing me stuff and me having to double check it all here and then other people can vet it
[45:35.000 --> 45:42.000]  and then media may pick it up don't just try to go to Alex Jones because I'm like trying to drink mounts
[45:42.000 --> 45:48.000]  you know Lake Superior out of a straw here and I keep sending me stuff it's just that
[45:48.000 --> 45:51.000]  you need to move with it as well.
[45:51.000 --> 45:56.000]  Vaughn in Washington DC disagrees Vaughn you're on the air.
[45:56.000 --> 46:03.000]  Yes Alex I don't totally disagree with much of what you're saying but just think about it
[46:03.000 --> 46:08.000]  Memorandum 200 written of course by Jeff Kissinger
[46:08.000 --> 46:16.000]  He had mentioned how the population was growing from 1830 up until the time he had written in his projection to 2000
[46:16.000 --> 46:26.000]  Based on the money system that we have that we operate off of in the world fiat not resource based money system
[46:26.000 --> 46:37.000]  The population is too large it's too big and you don't think that it's too big for the economic money system that we have to exchange
[46:37.000 --> 46:44.000]  No sir the globalist all day talk about how they want to have the economy be good for us but in their more internal memorandum
[46:44.000 --> 46:47.000]  it's all about shutting down economies and making us poor.
[46:47.000 --> 46:55.000]  We have incredible wealth and the elite says we'll overproduce and deplete their resources if we become wealthy
[46:55.000 --> 47:02.000]  but then they separately block the development of real new technologies because that would destroy their monopolies
[47:02.000 --> 47:11.000]  Okay and so the truth is we should already be on Mars right now and there is a breakaway civilization how advanced it is we don't know
[47:11.000 --> 47:19.000]  but that's why they're on this power trip talking about staging terror attacks on TV in front of us because they're that arrogant
[47:19.000 --> 47:23.000]  and I appreciate your call but that doesn't really sound like a disagreement there.
[47:23.000 --> 47:28.000]  I'm moving quick here Matt in California who disagrees you're on the air.
[47:28.000 --> 47:35.000]  Yes I've heard I've been subjected to listening to you from my brother-in-law for about a week
[47:35.000 --> 47:40.000]  and I can't say that I can disagree with everything you say exponentially.
[47:40.000 --> 47:46.000]  I can't even if you were right about all of your paranoid rantings I couldn't get behind you because of your anger.
[47:46.000 --> 47:49.000]  You're just such an angry person you're scary.
[47:49.000 --> 47:59.000]  You bet buddy I am scary absolutely I got red blood I like my wife I like freedom God guts and guns you better believe it
[47:59.000 --> 48:05.000]  and but let's expand on that you said you know paranoid rantings.
[48:05.000 --> 48:14.000]  Sure the guy just called in about memorandum 200 to break countries down and starve people to death which they're doing to the tune of 30 million a year.
[48:14.000 --> 48:22.000]  Now I'm giving you real numbers here I'm giving you documents I'm giving you Operation Himmler staged terror attacks by Hitler to start World War II.
[48:22.000 --> 48:32.000]  Why is it that popularly known I'm giving you real memorandum and real names of people calling for terror attacks today to take our liberties and start World War III.
[48:32.000 --> 48:38.000]  I predicted all of what's happening in Europe right now with precision not because it was hard but because it was all public.
[48:38.000 --> 48:44.000]  I mean specifically where am I wrong.
[48:44.000 --> 48:52.000]  The thing about it is that it's wrong in that I don't feel I have as much in common with you bitter clingers and you gun toters as I would with if we had a foreign occupation.
[48:52.000 --> 48:56.000]  I would have more in common with the Russian or German troop on the street.
[48:56.000 --> 49:05.000]  I'm not afraid of progress you're trying to say that we should dismantle the government people do you realize they can't go backwards that people need the system.
[49:05.000 --> 49:11.000]  And people like you are just trying to to to take away from the people that don't have.
[49:11.000 --> 49:15.000]  Hold just a minute sir is this a serious phone call.
[49:15.000 --> 49:18.000]  So that started hearing you almost laugh right there.
[49:18.000 --> 49:22.000]  Is this serious phone call is another people like you out there are you serious.
[49:22.000 --> 49:34.000]  I'm very nervous sir because you're frightening you are so aggressive you talk about you get into a people you bow up to people and you yell.
[49:34.000 --> 49:42.000]  And I've had to hear about you from my brother in law for months about how wonderful you are and how you're going to save America.
[49:42.000 --> 49:45.000]  And the whole time all you do is these just selling products.
[49:45.000 --> 49:50.000]  Oh you want to buy my water filter want to buy my pollen burst you know.
[49:50.000 --> 49:54.000]  Yes I believe that America needs to progress forward.
[49:54.000 --> 50:00.000]  And the thing is I'm I'm hoping that we actually have our current president for life.
[50:00.000 --> 50:10.000]  Because we need to keep progressing forward if we take a step backward into the evil ways of Romney or worse yet Ron Paul.
[50:10.000 --> 50:12.000]  Good God it could all fall apart.
[50:12.000 --> 50:15.000]  All right I appreciate your call I don't think that's a serious call.
[50:15.000 --> 50:19.000]  But I have heard people like that so it might be he did attack me for selling things.
[50:19.000 --> 50:25.000]  Let me explain something George Soros and MSNBC get banker bailout money your tax money.
[50:25.000 --> 50:32.000]  500 million in stimulus went to MSNBC to not hire one person but give all their pig like staff raises.
[50:32.000 --> 50:34.000]  Okay.
[50:34.000 --> 50:37.000]  The high level pig like staff.
[50:37.000 --> 50:42.000]  I sell products I believe in to sell finance and that's supposedly a bad thing.
[50:42.000 --> 50:48.000]  By the way we've sold over 10,000 of the 50,000 magazines we have it's going to sell out very soon.
[50:48.000 --> 50:56.000]  The new October issue of info wars magazine is out buy it in bulk and give it to people infowarstore.com.
[50:56.000 --> 51:00.000]  I'm proud to not be a communist please support us to get the word out.
[51:00.000 --> 51:06.000]  The worst drought in 50 years continues and the first six months of 2012 marks the hottest half year on record.
[51:06.000 --> 51:09.000]  78% of the Midwest corn belt is in drought conditions.
[51:09.000 --> 51:15.000]  Not only corn but soy, alfalfa, fruits, vegetables and wheat are all impacted raising prices.
[51:15.000 --> 51:20.000]  The cost to feed livestock is forcing farmers and ranchers out of business blowing up your food prices.
[51:20.000 --> 51:28.000]  The only strategy to counter this is to freeze your food cost to today's prices by getting your own supply of foods from e-foods direct now.
[51:28.000 --> 51:32.000]  As the price of raw ingredients increases, e-foods will have to raise prices too.
[51:32.000 --> 51:34.000]  Now is the time to get your supply.
[51:34.000 --> 51:38.000]  I recently increased my supply from e-foods direct because we've all known this was coming.
[51:38.000 --> 51:41.000]  You know about their delicious long term storeable foods.

[51:45.000 --> 51:48.000]  they're locking in today's prices and avoiding the rising food cost.

[53:00.000 --> 53:04.000]  Digestive health is the key to wellness and elimination of toxins.
[53:04.000 --> 53:09.000]  That bears repeating. Digestive health is the key to wellness and elimination of toxins.
[53:09.000 --> 53:13.000]  And pro-EM1 daily probiotic cleanse is the key to digestive health.
[53:13.000 --> 53:19.000]  Pro-EM1 is a powerful liquid probiotic, strong enough to cleanse, gentle enough to use every day.
[53:19.000 --> 53:24.000]  Pro-EM1 is dairy, wheat and soy free, contains all natural and certified organic ingredients,
[53:24.000 --> 53:28.000]  contains no preservatives or animal products, supports a healthy digestive and immune system,
[53:28.000 --> 53:33.000]  supports weight loss, improves absorption of food nutrients, aids in controlling yeast infections,
[53:33.000 --> 53:39.000]  is never freeze dried and uses three groups of live, viable beneficial microbes to cleanse and remove toxins.

[53:52.000 --> 53:55.000]  That's 866-369-3678.
[53:55.000 --> 54:15.000]  Pro-EM1, the raw probiotic.
[54:15.000 --> 54:19.000]  We are being pushed over a financial cliff by design.
[54:19.000 --> 54:25.000]  The megabanks are funding the radical Muslims, the communists, the socialists and the controlled right wing
[54:25.000 --> 54:29.000]  to create crises so they can pose as the saviors.
[54:29.000 --> 54:33.000]  That's the method of the madness and it's bipartisan, it's not just Obama.
[54:33.000 --> 54:37.000]  Eurozone confidence falls, inflation expectations rise.
[54:37.000 --> 54:41.000]  They've had like four bailouts to the globalist, I thought that would fix everything.
[54:41.000 --> 54:44.000]  No raising taxes imploded it further, which means they can consolidate.
[54:44.000 --> 54:50.000]  Spain gears up for the day of cuts after riots, Greece is better investment than China right now.
[54:50.000 --> 54:53.000]  Just absolutely incredible news.
[54:53.000 --> 54:58.000]  Bank of Japan is ready for monetary stimulus again, more money to themselves.
[54:58.000 --> 55:02.000]  Corporate America sweats as U.S. nears fiscal cliff.
[55:02.000 --> 55:04.000]  Romney says, hey, don't expect tax cuts.
[55:04.000 --> 55:06.000]  That's what they're announcing.
[55:06.000 --> 55:11.000]  Both parties are going to raise taxes because it goes to the foreign banks and to their giant dependent class.
[55:11.000 --> 55:15.000]  PPOC makes record cash injection to fend off crunch.
[55:15.000 --> 55:19.000]  Durable goods drops worse since recession ended four years ago.
[55:19.000 --> 55:21.000]  It never ended, Jack.
[55:21.000 --> 55:26.000]  We're in a depression by every real standard.
[55:26.000 --> 55:29.000]  GDP numbers depressingly weak.
[55:29.000 --> 55:32.000]  Postal service prepares for second default in two months.
[55:32.000 --> 55:40.000]  Fed virtually funding the entire U.S. deficit and getting us more in debt to them as they bail us out with fiat money.
[55:40.000 --> 55:45.000]  Honeymoon over as markets brace for volatile times up for QE3 announcement.
[55:45.000 --> 55:49.000]  Unemployment in France surpasses 3 million.
[55:49.000 --> 55:54.000]  Euro crisis fuels Spanish separatism, but they're trying to force them into this mega-euro.
[55:54.000 --> 56:01.000]  I wanted to bring Ted Anderson up here for more evil crash, you know, crash commercialism, but it's news mixed in.
[56:01.000 --> 56:03.000]  Ted's got the best deals on Golden Silver.
[56:03.000 --> 56:08.000]  You call and say I want the Alex Jones radio special, the best deals in the Golden Silver industry.
[56:08.000 --> 56:12.000]  But I wanted to briefly get Ted up to talk about gold jumps as stocks rise.
[56:12.000 --> 56:16.000]  I mean, what is gold up? 200 bucks or something in the last month? It's amazing.
[56:16.000 --> 56:20.000]  And Ted still has gold he bought a few weeks ago, but it keeps going up.
[56:20.000 --> 56:22.000]  It's about to sell out and prices will go up.
[56:22.000 --> 56:28.000]  He was telling me last night, and he has the two silver dollars it cost with two free films and a free book.
[56:28.000 --> 56:32.000]  The Obama deception, which is great to wake people up.
[56:32.000 --> 56:34.000]  What's the other film?
[56:34.000 --> 56:41.000]  He's got the amazing animated film about the Federal Reserve and the globalist and the Rothschilds American dream in the book.
[56:41.000 --> 56:46.000]  It's honest money. That's a $60 value with the silver dollars at cost.
[56:46.000 --> 56:50.000]  I mean, that is the lost leader. That is the name of lost leader in the dictionary.
[56:50.000 --> 56:56.000]  There should be a picture of that special that you can call and get the radio Alex Jones special for that.
[56:56.000 --> 57:01.000]  And there's a big list of other Golden Silver, 800-686-2237.
[57:01.000 --> 57:06.000]  I was just going to get Ted on just to talk about the gold prices going back up and what he sees in the economy.
[57:06.000 --> 57:13.000]  But why? I mean, I just believe in this, so I'm like, buy it, buy it, 800-686-2237.
[57:13.000 --> 57:18.000]  Ted, we're going to break here, got five minutes with you after that, and then I got David Ike coming up.
[57:18.000 --> 57:22.000]  But what do you make of the meltdown in Europe that's taking place?
[57:22.000 --> 57:27.000]  Well, the meltdown in Europe is getting to be a huge thing, but right here you're talking about the GDP.
[57:27.000 --> 57:33.000]  The second quarter GDP was downgraded down to 1.3% growth, revised downward.
[57:33.000 --> 57:38.000]  But I thought we were conspiracy theorists when we said we never left the recession, and things would only get worse.
[57:38.000 --> 57:42.000]  I guess we're even worse that we were totally right again, Ted.
[57:42.000 --> 57:49.000]  No, I know we're joining the evil ways of Ron Paul. I was laughing so hard when I heard that comment.
[57:49.000 --> 57:59.000]  I didn't believe it. But yeah, we're looking at the GDP dropping, which means that if we're already using 45% of our GDP to service interest on debt,
[57:59.000 --> 58:03.000]  then what's going to happen with the GDP shrinks? It's getting worse.
[58:03.000 --> 58:06.000]  Yeah, everybody thinks that things are going to get better.
[58:06.000 --> 58:14.000]  And now, of course, like you said, China is expected to have stimulus as well, which is going to drive prices up even further.
[58:14.000 --> 58:18.000]  We're seeing the prices of gold higher than we've ever seen it this year.
[58:18.000 --> 58:24.000]  I wouldn't be up here saying I think gold's going up to 2,000 by the end of the year if I didn't think it was.
[58:24.000 --> 58:33.000]  And there's a lot of top analysts saying 2,400. All I know is this paper currency is as dangerous as a 95-year-old man who's had 14 heart attacks
[58:33.000 --> 58:39.000]  climbing the Empire State Building stairs. I believe we need to get into gold and silver. We'll be right back.
[58:39.000 --> 58:47.000]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[59:10.000 --> 59:17.000]  The only strategy to counter this is to freeze your food cost at today's prices by getting your own supply of foods from E-Foods Direct now.
[59:17.000 --> 59:23.000]  As the price of raw ingredients increases, E-Foods will have to raise prices too. Now is the time to get your supply.
[59:23.000 --> 59:27.000]  I recently increased my supply from E-Foods Direct because we've all known this was coming.
[59:27.000 --> 59:33.000]  You know about their delicious long-term storable foods. The fact is you can eat it anytime to save money today.
[59:33.000 --> 59:37.000]  And because it's stored for 25 years, you're locking in today's prices and avoiding the rising food cost.
[59:37.000 --> 59:43.000]  Don't wait. Call 800-409-5633 or go to eFoodsDirect.com forward slash Alex.
[59:43.000 --> 01:00:08.000]  Call 800-409-5633 or eFoodsDirect.com forward slash Alex. You can bet your life on E-Foods Direct.
[01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:22.000]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:27.000]  Look, I got loaded lines with people that disagree with me because I hope the phone's up for people that disagree.
[01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:34.000]  Most of the people engaged in satire. Is there anyone out there that can actually disagree with what we're saying or doing?
[01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:38.000]  We had one caller saying, hey, he thinks I'm wrong about who did the anthrax attacks.
[01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:45.000]  Totally legitimate to disagree with me. I don't know if he's right, but I welcome that because I want to be corrected when I'm wrong.
[01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:49.000]  I don't think I have all the answers. I'm wise enough to know I don't.
[01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:55.000]  And we'll be getting your calls. David Ike's coming up. Who knows? You may have to sit on hold until Ike's gone.
[01:00:55.000 --> 01:01:01.000]  Or I may just go to you while Ike's on that. That would be something of some interesting talk radio informative, wouldn't it?
[01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:07.000]  We'll see what David wants to do. But I see everybody there. Simon in England, George in Connecticut.
[01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:15.000]  Gordon in Texas. Aaron in Nevada. Scott in North Carolina. I guess George and Scott have been holding the longest.
[01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:21.000]  Going back to Ted Anderson. Ted, look, I've been promoting gold since it was 260 smackers.
[01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:28.000]  260 fellow reserve notes apiece. Really 254, whatever the low was. What was the low 12 years ago?
[01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:30.000]  Yeah, 245.
[01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:37.000]  Okay, so I've been promoting it since it was above that and went down and then back up. And I'm promoting it now.
[01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:43.000]  When they drove it down 300 bucks, I was still promoting it because I know they're going to kill this fiat currency and they're in the business of doing it right now.
[01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:50.000]  The dollar can go up and down, but all the currencies and the aggregate are going down. I believe in gold and silver, but it's really getting creepy now.
[01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:55.000]  When mainstream news says we could have a total global depression by December.
[01:01:55.000 --> 01:02:03.000]  I'm not saying that's going to happen, but what's your best dead reckoning? You're a smart savvy guy. Where do you see this going? How bad is this going to get?
[01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:14.000]  Well, when you see countries like China having to put stimulus into their economy to fight off the United States stimulus, what that means is we're turning on our printing processes, so they have to turn on theirs.
[01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:17.000]  It's a currency war that's going on. It's an inflation race.
[01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:29.000]  Exactly. And so how do you measure things? If the US dollar is falling against the Japanese currency, but the Japanese are depleting the value of their currency and then the Germans are doing the same and China now follows through,
[01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:38.000]  you're measuring yourself against foreign currencies when you're looking at indexes. You have to then turn to the commodities and say, what's exactly happening to money?
[01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:49.000]  And when you see gold going from 1550 to now 178170, you know that the value of the currency is dropping against real tangible goods.
[01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:58.000]  And that's what happens when you have quantitative easing. This is the thing, this is the depression that the mainstream media is talking about.
[01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:08.000]  We are going to see the price of everything go up and anybody that saved their money, anybody that isn't working for a wage, are going to find that they have to work twice as hard, twice as long.
[01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:18.000]  And the people that are retired and have to live off their fixed incomes are going to have a choice between, do I heat the house this month or do I buy inflated prices of food?
[01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:28.000]  It gets down to that and that's the problem with inflation. I had a friend of mine saying that we need to raise taxes in order to solve this debt problem.
[01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:37.000]  You know what? We are raising taxes. When you turn on the printing press, that's a taxation. It's coming directly out of everybody's pocket. It's a flat tax.
[01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:44.000]  Prices of commodities are going to go up. Price of everything is going to go up. It isn't that that stuff is becoming more valuable.
[01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:51.000]  It's that the currency is being produced way too quickly and we're seeing that drop in value. And that's why it's so important.
[01:03:51.000 --> 01:04:00.000]  If you want to hedge yourself, you find something that's going to hold value, something that's spent money for years and years and years and has nothing to do with the printing presses.
[01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:05.000]  And the goal just happens to be, on silver, happens to be one of those very liquid commodities that you can get into.
[01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:14.000]  Soros and all the elites piling into it right now. And I know what you do with your profits. I know what I do. I put most of it back into the info war.
[01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:20.000]  But what I put is my emergency reserve. We're talking about gold and silver and the place I get it is Midas Resources. The trusted name.
[01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:25.000]  Whether it's pneumosomatic or bullion, they're the bullion experts but they've got it all on hand.
[01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:35.000]  I like so many other outfits that attack all the competition and the rest of it. Ted doesn't do that. He's become the fifth largest dealer in the country in the last 15 years by incredible quality and service.
[01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:47.000]  800-686-2237. I would protect yourself today and I believe, it's my opinion and my view, that's what I do for my family, that Midas Resources and gold and silver is the place to go.
[01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:55.000]  Two silver dollars at cost, 72 smackers with $60 of books and videos free on top of it. No one can get anywhere close to this.
[01:04:55.000 --> 01:05:21.000]  800-686-2337. Thank you, Ted.
[01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:47.000]  Thank you, Ted.
[01:05:47.000 --> 01:06:12.000]  Thank you, Ted.
[01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:38.000]  Thank you, Ted.
[01:06:38.000 --> 01:07:00.000]  Thank you, Ted.
[01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:27.000]  Thank you, Ted.
[01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:53.000]  Thank you, Ted.
[01:07:53.000 --> 01:08:22.000]  Thank you, Ted.
[01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:49.000]  Thank you, Ted.
[01:08:49.000 --> 01:09:15.000]  Thank you, Ted.
[01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:41.000]  Thank you, Ted.
[01:09:41.000 --> 01:10:07.000]  Thank you, Ted.
[01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:36.000]  Thank you, Ted.
[01:10:36.000 --> 01:11:02.000]  Thank you, Ted.
[01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:29.000]  Thank you, Ted.
[01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:55.000]  Thank you, Ted.
[01:11:55.000 --> 01:12:22.000]  Thank you, Ted.
[01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:49.000]  Thank you, Ted.
[01:12:49.000 --> 01:13:16.000]  Thank you, Ted.
[01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:43.000]  Thank you, Ted.
[01:13:43.000 --> 01:14:12.000]  Thank you, Ted.
[01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:40.000]  Thank you, Ted.
[01:14:40.000 --> 01:15:08.000]  Thank you, Ted.
[01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:37.000]  Thank you, Ted.
[01:15:38.000 --> 01:16:05.000]  Thank you, Ted.
[01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:34.000]  Thank you, Ted.
[01:16:35.000 --> 01:17:04.000]  Thank you, Ted.
[01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:34.000]  Thank you, Ted.
[01:17:35.000 --> 01:18:02.000]  Thank you, Ted.
[01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:31.000]  Thank you, Ted.
[01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:59.000]  Thank you, Ted.
[01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:28.000]  Thank you, Ted.
[01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:58.000]  Thank you, Ted.
[01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:26.000]  Thank you, Ted.
[01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:55.000]  Thank you, Ted.
[01:20:56.000 --> 01:21:25.000]  Thank you, Ted.
[01:21:26.000 --> 01:21:55.000]  Thank you, Ted.
[01:21:56.000 --> 01:22:15.000]  Thank you, Ted.
[01:22:15.000 --> 01:22:44.000]  Thank you, Ted.
[01:22:45.000 --> 01:23:14.000]  Thank you, Ted.
[01:23:15.000 --> 01:23:44.000]  Thank you, Ted.
[01:23:45.000 --> 01:24:14.000]  Thank you, Ted.
