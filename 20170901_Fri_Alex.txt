[00:00.000 --> 00:11.920]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government coverage.
[00:11.920 --> 00:13.720]  Wow, it's September 1st already?
[00:13.720 --> 00:14.720]  You want answers?
[00:14.720 --> 00:16.720]  Well, so does he.
[00:16.720 --> 00:17.720]  Amazing.
[00:17.720 --> 00:23.760]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:23.760 --> 00:27.840]  You know, I read these stories yesterday and people didn't believe me, but now here it
[00:27.840 --> 00:28.840]  is in Reuters.
[00:28.840 --> 00:33.520]  Putin warns North Korea's situation on the verge of large-scale conflict, as cause Trump's
[00:33.520 --> 00:34.840]  told him, get ready.
[00:34.840 --> 00:35.840]  This is serious.
[00:35.840 --> 00:40.520]  But first, Trump and the American people are vindicated, Antifa, are violent thugs,
[00:40.520 --> 00:43.520]  and it turns out the FBI has listed them as a criminal gang.
[00:43.520 --> 00:44.520]  You're a f***ing anti-American.
[00:44.520 --> 00:45.520]  I'm an anti-American.
[00:45.520 --> 00:46.520]  You're stupid bastard.
[00:46.520 --> 00:47.520]  I'm a f***ing patriot.
[00:47.520 --> 00:56.520]  I think we should classify them as a gang.
[00:56.520 --> 01:02.160]  Now they come dressed in uniforms, they have weapons, they're almost a militia.
[01:02.160 --> 01:05.560]  I think we need to think about that in terms of our law enforcement approach.
[01:05.560 --> 01:12.960]  We condemn, in the strongest possible terms, this egregious display of hatred, bigotry,
[01:12.960 --> 01:15.000]  and violence on many sides.
[01:15.000 --> 01:16.000]  On many sides.
[01:16.000 --> 01:19.200]  Wait, on many sides?
[01:19.200 --> 01:21.480]  This was a white nationalist rally.
[01:21.480 --> 01:23.560]  You have to call that out by name.
[01:23.560 --> 01:27.560]  On many sides?
[01:27.560 --> 01:32.080]  Mr. President, this is terrorism, not your order at KFC.
[01:32.080 --> 01:37.120]  Prior to the unrest, police banned sticks, masks, any other potential weapons, so ever
[01:37.120 --> 01:40.240]  dozens of anti-fascist protesters broke those rules and appears.
[01:40.240 --> 01:44.320]  They also pepper sprayed the leader of the conservative group, one left-wing demonstrator
[01:44.320 --> 01:48.080]  attacked the photographer, and others reportedly threatened people who were trying to film
[01:48.080 --> 01:49.080]  the violence.
[01:49.080 --> 01:53.520]  What about the alt-left that came charging at the, as you say, the alt-right?
[01:53.520 --> 01:56.640]  Do they have any semblance of guilt?
[01:56.640 --> 01:59.320]  Let me ask you this.
[01:59.320 --> 02:04.240]  What about the fact that they came charging with clubs in their hands, swinging clubs?
[02:04.240 --> 02:06.160]  Do they have any problem?
[02:06.160 --> 02:07.160]  I think they do.
[02:07.160 --> 02:14.160]  And they are just beating people, ganging up, men and women, ganging up on lone individuals,
[02:14.160 --> 02:19.400]  and just beating them in a wanton, savage, brown shirt, Nazi operation.
[02:19.400 --> 02:25.840]  They don't want to mention ANTIFA and how ANTIFA literally came trained, militarized,
[02:25.840 --> 02:31.880]  doing war-like maneuvers, you know, they bring coolers and you think, oh, it's to stay hydrated.
[02:31.880 --> 02:36.360]  No, it's filled with water balloons, filled with feces, urine, just disgusting things
[02:36.360 --> 02:38.240]  that will pop and explode on people.
[02:38.240 --> 02:40.840]  And water bottles filled with the same substances.
[02:40.840 --> 02:55.840]  Yeah, he just got struck with pepper spray, by some illegal liberal helping him.
[02:55.840 --> 02:56.840]  We're not all like this.
[02:56.840 --> 03:00.080]  No, you see, that guy attacked him, it's not a liberal, he's a Marxist.
[03:00.080 --> 03:03.800]  Every time one of these situations happens, you know, you see the worst of people, sometimes
[03:03.800 --> 03:05.600]  I think we saw it out of the left.
[03:05.600 --> 03:10.720]  You just saw those videos of them chasing and beating people, people in black clothing,
[03:10.720 --> 03:14.840]  black masks, over 100 of them broke through the lines and attacked stragglers who were
[03:14.840 --> 03:15.840]  there.
[03:15.840 --> 03:17.320]  For the most part, the event was shut down.
[03:17.320 --> 03:20.760]  They couldn't find enough conservatives, so they started attacking the police after
[03:20.760 --> 03:26.120]  a while, but you saw them beating the conservatives, even as they come in carrying no hate signs.
[03:26.120 --> 03:32.400]  And the mayor said they made sure the themes of love and compassion dominated over hate
[03:32.400 --> 03:33.400]  speech.
[03:33.400 --> 03:41.840]  The supporters of President Donald Trump were vastly outnumbered by counter protesters
[03:41.840 --> 03:44.200]  at Martin Luther King Junior Civic Center Park.
[03:44.200 --> 03:49.280]  And then we saw that group with the masks on, they had their own, you know, shields
[03:49.280 --> 03:55.040]  that they made for lack of a better term, a huge crowd there now.
[03:55.040 --> 03:59.160]  And while we certainly don't know, certainly, and we'll try to find out, some of those
[03:59.160 --> 04:04.480]  protesters, the ones that showed up with the masks and the shields, may do this in other
[04:04.480 --> 04:05.480]  locations.
[04:05.480 --> 04:09.160]  They may do what you call professional protesters who do this a lot.
[04:09.160 --> 04:12.480]  Again, the full report is up on infowars.com.
[04:12.480 --> 04:19.280]  Trump indicated our violent thugs, and it then goes into the clips of Pelosi and the
[04:19.280 --> 04:23.760]  rest of them admitting now that it is basically a terrorist organization.
[04:23.760 --> 04:26.680]  And the new report is up on infowars.com.
[04:26.680 --> 04:31.640]  It turns out, even last year under Obama, they'd been secretly identified as a terrorist
[04:31.640 --> 04:36.640]  organization, as the primary instigators of violence, and a criminal gang.
[04:36.640 --> 04:42.360]  There's really a powerful article of the weekly standard of beating in Berkeley, and it actually
[04:42.360 --> 04:48.680]  documents how the so-called antifa beat up mainly Japanese black people, just really
[04:48.680 --> 04:53.080]  mild-mannered, nice folks that came out for the free speech rally, because they believe
[04:53.080 --> 04:54.680]  free speech is very, very important.
[04:54.680 --> 04:58.880]  And that's why it's finally blown up in their fascist faces.
[04:58.880 --> 05:07.800]  We've got great air filters, great water filters, great non-GMO heirloom seeds, great
[05:07.800 --> 05:11.480]  books, great films, great patriot apparel to meet like-minded people, and we've got
[05:11.480 --> 05:16.520]  a new humongoid sale, not the number of things that are on massive sale, but on what's on
[05:16.520 --> 05:17.520]  sale.
[05:17.520 --> 05:21.000]  Out for months, not been on sale for months and months, we've never offered super male
[05:21.000 --> 05:27.000]  vitality, known concentrated herbs, cold pressed, super male vitality, 57% off.
[05:27.000 --> 05:28.600]  It's never been the price.
[05:28.600 --> 05:34.480]  It is right now, with 3,596 reviews, 4.6 reviews total by third-party sites, unprecedented,
[05:34.480 --> 05:36.360]  and it's cold pressed.
[05:36.360 --> 05:38.200]  That's why super male is so different.
[05:38.200 --> 05:41.400]  People say, well, I know these compounds work, it's admitted to science, these are other
[05:41.400 --> 05:44.600]  what you sell, they, BuzzFeed said, it's like, it's already best-selling stuff, it's been
[05:44.600 --> 05:48.680]  certified as healthy and good forever, why these aren't anything new, because why do
[05:48.680 --> 05:59.680]  you do something new, and you can have the oldest and best bite cold pressed, boo, boo.
[05:59.680 --> 06:03.200]  After being sold out for months, our best-selling super blue fluoride toothpaste is now back
[06:03.200 --> 06:05.440]  in stock at m4store.com.
[06:05.440 --> 06:10.200]  Research across the board is clear, when bacteria infect your gums, it can enter your bloodstream
[06:10.200 --> 06:12.600]  and even contribute to blood clots and heart attacks.
[06:12.600 --> 06:17.200]  That's why the last surgeon general's report on oral health warns that your oral health
[06:17.200 --> 06:19.960]  can have a serious impact on your entire body.
[06:19.960 --> 06:24.440]  Super blue fluoride-free toothpaste is a groundbreaking new formula that's loaded with good halogen
[06:24.440 --> 06:27.120]  iodide, instead of the bad halogen fluoride.
[06:27.120 --> 06:31.640]  Super blue contains natural oils and ingredients used since biblical times to help wipe out
[06:31.640 --> 06:34.160]  bad bacteria and eliminate bad breath.
[06:34.160 --> 06:38.760]  Just some of the ingredients in super blue, chosen by our dental experts include xylitol,
[06:38.760 --> 06:43.640]  peppermint oil, iodide, nano silver, and more, due to requests from listeners who found
[06:43.640 --> 06:46.480]  that spearmint was a little bit too strong for some of their children.
[06:46.480 --> 06:50.160]  You've created the new bubble gum flavored super blue that is spearmint-free.

[07:51.440 --> 07:55.840]  Head on over to infowarslife.com and say goodbye to fatigue.
[07:55.840 --> 08:14.240]  That's infowarslife.com.
[08:43.160 --> 08:49.200]  We've got so much to cover today and a raft of guests that we're going to be interviewing.
[08:49.200 --> 09:13.880]  The first thing I wanted to do was basically read this headline for you.
[09:13.880 --> 09:17.760]  You had a group on one side that was bad and you had a group on the other side that was
[09:17.760 --> 09:22.840]  also very violent and nobody wants to say that, but I'll say it right now.
[09:22.840 --> 09:27.760]  You had a group, you had a group on the other side that came charging in without a permit
[09:27.760 --> 09:29.760]  and they were very, very violent.
[09:29.760 --> 09:39.120]  Are you an advocate of this sort of confrontation?
[09:39.120 --> 09:40.120]  Yes I am.
[09:40.120 --> 09:41.120]  Yes.
[09:41.120 --> 09:45.640]  Mark Bray is a Dartmouth professor who has studied the Antifa anti-fascist movement.
[09:45.640 --> 09:50.240]  Antifa is a far-left political movement that argues it's necessary to confront hate groups
[09:50.240 --> 09:51.240]  sometimes with force.
[09:51.240 --> 09:56.040]  Professor Bray is author of the new book, Antifa, the Anti-Fascist Handbook.
[09:56.040 --> 09:58.720]  Antifa are not calling on the government to censor anyone.
[09:58.720 --> 10:03.240]  In fact, they resist the notion of turning to the government or turning to the police
[10:03.240 --> 10:07.480]  who we've seen have been infiltrated by white supremacists who have been sympathetic to
[10:07.480 --> 10:10.800]  the court's sort of return to law and order notion of fascism.
[10:10.800 --> 10:15.000]  And so the idea is the real enemies of free speech are fascists.
[10:15.000 --> 10:16.480]  We've seen that historically.
[10:16.480 --> 10:20.240]  We've seen that they're the ones that if they have their way will shut down speech.
[10:20.240 --> 10:24.640]  And it also differs in the sense that anti-fascists see this as a political struggle.
[10:24.640 --> 10:29.280]  They don't see fascism as a difference of opinion or as kind of a different perspective
[10:29.280 --> 10:30.280]  to consider.
[10:30.280 --> 10:33.480]  Instead they see fascists as the enemy and I think that we need to come around to that
[10:33.480 --> 10:36.400]  notion considering that there is no doubt what they've done historically.
[10:36.400 --> 10:39.040]  You can't say that this is both sides of violence.
[10:39.040 --> 10:44.520]  What we saw was white supremacists and then what we saw were some brave people risking
[10:44.520 --> 10:50.040]  their lives and putting themselves in between white supremacists and what they were doing.
[10:50.040 --> 10:54.920]  So we saw white supremacists initiate this action, try to bully those people, try to
[10:54.920 --> 11:00.400]  instill fear and we saw brave people there in Charlottesville standing against them.
[11:00.400 --> 11:03.320]  That is, you cannot equate both sides.
[11:03.320 --> 11:04.520]  This was not many sides.
[11:04.520 --> 11:07.840]  There was a group the president mentioned that we haven't heard about.
[11:07.840 --> 11:10.600]  The alt-left, so who are they?
[11:10.600 --> 11:14.280]  Simply put, the alt-left does not exist.
[11:14.280 --> 11:18.320]  According to the Anti-Defamation League, it's a made-up term that refers to no actual
[11:18.320 --> 11:20.360]  group or organization.
[11:20.360 --> 11:24.880]  Many in the alt-right actually refer to groups when they protest them as Antifa.
[11:24.880 --> 11:26.600]  That refers to anti-fascists.
[11:26.600 --> 11:31.200]  It's a name that some groups have latched onto, borrowing from an old left-wing extreme
[11:31.200 --> 11:34.680]  movement that popped up in the 1960s in Germany.
[11:34.680 --> 11:38.480]  Their goal is to physically confront Nazis and white supremacists.
[11:38.480 --> 11:42.800]  By most accounts, almost all of the people protesting against the hateful bigots, the
[11:42.800 --> 11:46.160]  Nazis and Klansmen in Charlottesville, were peaceful.
[11:46.160 --> 11:50.720]  The hateful bigots, the Nazis and Klansmen in Charlottesville.
[11:50.720 --> 11:56.880]  To equate a group that is a protest group, two protest groups, yes, they're both protest
[11:56.880 --> 12:00.360]  groups and they're talking about Antifa or Antifa, however you want to pronounce it,
[12:00.360 --> 12:01.720]  calling them the alt-left.
[12:01.720 --> 12:07.600]  Well, that group protests fascism, so they were there protesting fascism.
[12:07.600 --> 12:10.080]  Maybe their tactics weren't exactly right.
[12:10.080 --> 12:15.760]  All groups like that, political groups, rights groups, protest groups.
[12:15.760 --> 12:16.760]  It's messy.
[12:16.760 --> 12:22.000]  Antifa are people who go and they try to push back on these guys.
[12:22.000 --> 12:23.120]  Sometimes they go too far.
[12:23.120 --> 12:28.160]  I think that that is a significant issue, but it is not the case that they are going
[12:28.160 --> 12:33.000]  around building an armed movement to go and kill people.
[12:33.000 --> 12:39.720]  You've got the violent left and, by the way, Kate, no democratic policy.
[12:39.720 --> 12:41.440]  Nobody's been talking about the right.
[12:41.440 --> 12:46.320]  Nobody's been talking except for the president and myself about the violent left and Tifa,
[12:46.320 --> 12:51.320]  who have been equally to blame for the violence that occurred in Charlottesville.
[12:51.320 --> 12:55.360]  You think that there's any moral equivalence between a neo-Nazi and anyone else?
[12:55.360 --> 12:57.440]  I'm not trying to make any equivalence at all.
[12:57.440 --> 13:04.760]  What I'm saying is that any group that espouses violence in a democracy where it's not necessary
[13:04.760 --> 13:05.760]  is wrong.
[13:05.760 --> 13:09.920]  No one would have been there if Charlottesville had neo-Nazis gone there.
[13:09.920 --> 13:11.920]  No one would have been there.
[13:11.920 --> 13:16.560]  Or any democratic politician has come out and not even establishment Republicans have
[13:16.560 --> 13:22.400]  come out and condemned the far left group and Tifa, which has been espousing violence
[13:22.400 --> 13:23.400]  and attacking people.
[13:23.400 --> 13:24.720]  Why do you think that is, Corey?
[13:24.720 --> 13:25.880]  Maybe is it possible?
[13:25.880 --> 13:26.880]  Because they're afraid.
[13:26.880 --> 13:27.880]  No.
[13:27.880 --> 13:28.880]  Is it possible?
[13:28.880 --> 13:29.880]  Is it possible because someone died?
[13:29.880 --> 13:33.440]  Because establishment Republicans are afraid of being labeled by CNN as racist and bigots,
[13:33.440 --> 13:36.120]  and they know that that's exactly what you're going to do, and there's only a few of us
[13:36.120 --> 13:37.120]  who are going to stand up to you.
[13:37.120 --> 13:41.040]  Let me just ask you, you know, Paris said that the president's initial statement on
[13:41.040 --> 13:45.080]  Saturday was correct that, and one of the things the president said is that there was
[13:45.080 --> 13:48.960]  violence on many sides, on many sides.
[13:48.960 --> 13:49.960]  That's not true.
[13:49.960 --> 13:50.960]  I'm asking you.
[13:50.960 --> 13:51.960]  It's not on our side.
[13:51.960 --> 13:53.480]  It was not on our side at all.
[13:53.480 --> 13:54.480]  Was there violence on many sides?
[13:54.480 --> 13:55.480]  That's true.
[13:55.480 --> 13:56.480]  It was not on our side at all.
[13:56.480 --> 13:57.480]  Not at all.
[13:57.480 --> 13:58.480]  Not at all.
[13:58.480 --> 14:01.920]  That's PR strategy, that sounding brass and tinkling cymbal.
[14:01.920 --> 14:06.520]  We stand in there singing this little lie of mine, and about to get crushed, the light,
[14:06.520 --> 14:08.560]  our bodies, and our prophetic witness.
[14:08.560 --> 14:09.560]  It tripled up.
[14:09.560 --> 14:13.880]  There was no space for love and justice, given that vicious hatred.
[14:13.880 --> 14:18.360]  And we had the left, we had the anarchists, we had the anti-fascists.
[14:18.360 --> 14:24.200]  They were trying to both protect us, but they were also letting the neo-fascists know that
[14:24.200 --> 14:26.400]  there was opposition in this nation.
[14:26.400 --> 14:30.640]  And now the morning, Joe, Nancy Pelosi, the mayor of San Francisco.
[14:30.640 --> 14:38.840]  They all have to admit that antifa are equivalent to Nazis and are thugs and are horrible.
[14:38.840 --> 14:43.680]  So Donald Trump, who said bad on both sides to cry all the bigotry, all the hate, he was
[14:43.680 --> 14:45.200]  correct.
[14:45.200 --> 14:47.280]  He was correct.
[14:47.280 --> 14:52.400]  And now you've got the globalists trying to abort antifa that Soros and the foundations
[14:52.400 --> 15:00.120]  have been nurturing and suckling at their little-fetted rest for 20 years.
[15:00.120 --> 15:05.720]  And now they're flushing the big, meth-head turd.
[15:05.720 --> 15:09.240]  We've put a lot of these special reports out the last few days because they're so important.
[15:09.240 --> 15:16.560]  It really is a huge issue that the Democratic Party, multinational corporations led by George
[15:16.560 --> 15:22.200]  Soros' criminal networks that have overthrown countless nations, have actually created a
[15:22.200 --> 15:33.080]  giant Satanist-communist-meth-head army of glow-in-the-dark ne'er-duels to go out and
[15:33.080 --> 15:39.240]  physically, viciously attack anybody that doesn't support total communism.
[15:39.240 --> 15:44.080]  And they're so vicious that even in cities they control, like San Francisco, they viciously
[15:44.080 --> 15:51.520]  attacked the police and viciously attacked Black Lives Matter and basically took control
[15:51.520 --> 15:54.440]  of the situation in San Francisco.
[15:54.440 --> 16:00.320]  And that's why finally, after watching it in Boston and watching it in many other cities,
[16:00.320 --> 16:04.960]  the Democrats are going, these people are going to destroy us.
[16:04.960 --> 16:11.000]  And they make us look really bad and we've lost the fight trying to sell them as knights
[16:11.000 --> 16:18.920]  in shining armor like Sir Lancelot riding off to the dark tower to fight the Black Knight.
[16:18.920 --> 16:22.040]  That is not what's happening.
[16:22.040 --> 16:26.760]  And so think about what a seismic devastation this is, because they've got several rails
[16:26.760 --> 16:28.120]  trying to bring down Trump.
[16:28.120 --> 16:34.240]  They want to bring down the economy, admittedly, to stopping, but we're at 3.0 growth rate,
[16:34.240 --> 16:39.000]  something they said we never could do, something Obama never got.
[16:39.000 --> 16:41.040]  That's where the interest rates are being raised and everything is trying to shut it
[16:41.040 --> 16:42.040]  down.
[16:42.040 --> 16:45.920]  So they're trying to blow up into the economy, they're trying to launch a race war, they're
[16:45.920 --> 16:50.000]  trying to launch a societal breakdown, so they can be the referees that claim they're
[16:50.000 --> 16:51.400]  going to fix the problem.
[16:51.400 --> 16:56.120]  They helped accelerate with accelerant.
[16:56.120 --> 17:00.880]  And then they've got their other rail and that's the whole Russia thing.
[17:00.880 --> 17:04.320]  And now they're back to that, even though they had to drop it in the last month and
[17:04.320 --> 17:10.240]  are saying, don't worry, we're going to have our own hurricane.
[17:10.240 --> 17:14.000]  That's what Dan Rather said, hurricane of Vladimir.
[17:14.000 --> 17:19.360]  So former CBS anchor Dan Rather, along with Tom Brokaw and others, have been dug up out
[17:19.360 --> 17:24.920]  of the crypt, they're hanging out with the crypt keeper in, and he says Trump is seized
[17:24.920 --> 17:32.760]  with fear, actually it's the complete opposite, that Robert Mueller has correctly discovered
[17:32.760 --> 17:38.280]  the hurricane of Vladimir, about to make landfall in Washington.
[17:38.280 --> 17:44.800]  And you've got the incredibly corrupt Attorney General of New York teamed up with old Mueller
[17:44.800 --> 17:49.160]  that covered up for all the Clinton and Obama crimes and the Saudi funding and all the rest
[17:49.160 --> 17:50.160]  of it.
[17:50.160 --> 17:57.200]  And oh my gosh, shaking with fear as they try to destroy the recovery and try to divide
[17:57.200 --> 17:58.200]  the nation.
[17:58.200 --> 18:02.600]  And here came the hurricane, a tragic event, major gas shortages, they say there's not
[18:02.600 --> 18:03.600]  shortages.
[18:03.600 --> 18:07.320]  Well, I couldn't get gas this morning and every gas station I drove by and I drove by about
[18:07.320 --> 18:12.880]  nine of them, didn't have gas.
[18:12.880 --> 18:18.240]  So we've got that situation going on, but it brought us together and that's really
[18:18.240 --> 18:23.920]  got these social engineers, these divide and conquer experts really upset.
[18:23.920 --> 18:28.000]  So let's go ahead and play this Dan Rather clip.
[18:28.000 --> 18:35.040]  Donald Trump is afraid, he's trying to exude power and strengthen, well, he's afraid of
[18:35.040 --> 18:38.920]  something that Mueller and the prosecutors are going to find out.
[18:38.920 --> 18:44.680]  And what you're seeing that time after time is a president who is within himself, seized
[18:44.680 --> 18:46.280]  with fear.
[18:46.280 --> 18:51.080]  And that's going to be, you know, a political hurricane is out there and sees for him.
[18:51.080 --> 18:58.120]  We'll call it Hurricane Vladimir, if you will, again, they're projecting power.
[18:58.120 --> 19:00.040]  They're turning into a regional party.
[19:00.040 --> 19:02.800]  They're being absolutely universally loathed.
[19:02.800 --> 19:07.520]  Young people are now 70% national polls against abortion.
[19:07.520 --> 19:12.600]  They're hating mainline liberals, disliking mainline conservatives, there's a global awakening
[19:12.600 --> 19:14.800]  against globalism.
[19:14.800 --> 19:17.480]  All these fundamentals are turning against them.
[19:17.480 --> 19:23.280]  As people worldwide realize, corporate crony collectivism is a nightmare.
[19:23.280 --> 19:27.560]  So we need Dan Rather, the guy that sold us in all the false wars and all the rest of
[19:27.560 --> 19:33.680]  it, to exude confidence, Dan Rather got his start in Texas with the whole Kennedy assassination
[19:33.680 --> 19:40.880]  cover-up, Dan Rather reporting from Dallas, a president is dead, well, he's here telling
[19:40.880 --> 19:48.160]  us that, oh, no troops have confidence, Trump's about to fall, rally, rally, our champions
[19:48.160 --> 19:56.280]  antifa are our spear and standard, our beautiful young warriors will crush America, Trump will
[19:56.280 --> 19:59.040]  fall.
[19:59.040 --> 20:03.600]  You want to save money in a place that gives you growth, control and certainty without

[20:13.400 --> 20:14.660]  life insurance.

[24:20.520 --> 24:44.400]  We're back live, ladies and gentlemen, I'm your host Alex Jones.
[24:44.400 --> 24:47.480]  I want to go ahead and get into the geopolitical news and I'm going to come back and get into
[24:47.480 --> 24:52.120]  the latest on the hurricane and the new hurricane that's forming out in the Atlantic and come
[24:52.120 --> 24:57.520]  across Florida into the Gulf of Mexico yet again, we're watching that very closely.
[24:57.520 --> 25:02.040]  But here's the big news, you know, I mentioned this yesterday out of the Russian news and
[25:02.040 --> 25:07.880]  folks thought I was exaggerating, but it's now confirmed by Reuters Putin warns North
[25:07.880 --> 25:11.560]  Korea situation on verge of large-scale conflict.
[25:11.560 --> 25:15.480]  That's why I'm saying large-scale war.
[25:15.480 --> 25:20.640]  President Vladimir Putin warned on Friday that the tent standoff between North Korea
[25:20.640 --> 25:24.920]  and United States is on the verge of large-scale conflict and said it was a mistake to try
[25:24.920 --> 25:28.280]  to pressure the North Korea over its nuclear missile program.
[25:28.280 --> 25:32.600]  Putin, who is due to attend a summit of the BRICS nations in China next week, wrote in
[25:32.600 --> 25:36.640]  an article published on the Kremlin's website ahead of his trip, the favored negotiations
[25:36.640 --> 25:39.240]  with North Korea instead.
[25:39.240 --> 25:45.440]  It is essential to resolve the region's problems through direct dialogue involving all sides
[25:45.440 --> 25:49.960]  without advancing any preconditions, such as talks.
[25:49.960 --> 25:53.680]  Well, Tillerson and them have been talking about talks, but North Korea keeps threatening
[25:53.680 --> 25:57.440]  to nuke everybody so you can't do talks when they're doing that.
[25:57.440 --> 26:03.440]  Provocations, pressure, and bellicose and offensive rhetoric is the road to nowhere.
[26:03.440 --> 26:08.920]  The situation in the Korean Peninsula has deteriorated so much that it was now balanced
[26:08.920 --> 26:13.960]  on the verge of a large-scale conflict, said the Russian leader.
[26:13.960 --> 26:18.080]  North Korea has been working to develop a nuclear-tipped missile cable of hitting the
[26:18.080 --> 26:22.640]  United States and has recently threatened to land missiles near the U.S. specific territory
[26:22.640 --> 26:24.040]  of Guam.
[26:24.040 --> 26:30.240]  And Trump has said that that is a lie on the sand or possible lying that if they do that
[26:30.240 --> 26:32.960]  they'd better be ready for retaliation.
[26:32.960 --> 26:38.640]  Then the war that we're still in has been a ceasefire since July of 1953 will kick off
[26:38.640 --> 26:39.640]  again.
[26:39.640 --> 26:44.080]  On Monday, North Korean capital, which sees joint war games from the United States and
[26:44.080 --> 26:48.320]  South Korea's preparations for invasion, raised the stakes in its standoff to the United
[26:48.320 --> 26:53.800]  States and its allies by firing an intermediate-range missile over Japan.
[26:53.800 --> 26:57.920]  In Russia's opinion, the calculation that it is possible to hold North Korea's nuclear
[26:57.920 --> 27:03.200]  missile programs exclusively by putting pressure on the North is erroneous and futile Putin
[27:03.200 --> 27:10.160]  wrote, a roadmap formulated by Moscow and Beijing which would involve North Korean stopping
[27:10.160 --> 27:15.800]  work on missile program in exchange for the United States and South Korea halting large-scale
[27:15.800 --> 27:21.200]  war games was a way to gradually reduce tensions, wrote Putin.
[27:21.200 --> 27:28.120]  Well, we've been trying to appease North Korea for decades and our loving leaders, the Clintons,
[27:28.120 --> 27:32.880]  as usual, you know, if the clown's not real.
[27:32.880 --> 27:38.080]  If the clown's not a real metaphysical force, a space vampire, but the Clintons basically
[27:38.080 --> 27:39.080]  are.
[27:39.080 --> 27:40.080]  They probably have headlines.
[27:40.080 --> 27:42.880]  Jones says they're literal space vampires.
[27:42.880 --> 27:44.200]  They might as well be.
[27:44.200 --> 27:46.360]  Yeah, maybe they are.
[27:46.360 --> 27:48.720]  That's called trolling the media.
[27:48.720 --> 27:54.440]  Bill Clinton does it like a killer clown, though, from outer space, no makeup needed.
[27:54.440 --> 28:01.240]  U.S. bombers drill over Korean Peninsula for a third day after the latest North Korean
[28:01.240 --> 28:03.840]  launch and they've simulated dropping nuclear weapons.
[28:03.840 --> 28:07.200]  And we reported this two days ago, but Reuters is doing it now.
[28:07.200 --> 28:09.080]  So now it's real.
[28:09.080 --> 28:14.680]  See, I mean, I will say Reuters is a lot more accurate than CNN, but they still have a lot
[28:14.680 --> 28:20.920]  of fake news after North Korea, missile Britain and Japan agree on closer security ties.
[28:20.920 --> 28:23.000]  So that's some of the news there.
[28:23.000 --> 28:25.480]  Now here's some of the news coming up.
[28:25.480 --> 28:30.200]  When I saw this, I took a double take, but it's true.
[28:30.200 --> 28:34.480]  They want the bases removed and taken down.
[28:34.480 --> 28:38.760]  And I guess the names of the bases changed, but the SPLC with its offshore bank accounts
[28:38.760 --> 28:41.040]  and other activities is just all powerful.
[28:41.040 --> 28:44.000]  They run Facebook, Google, you know, they control the algorithms.
[28:44.000 --> 28:46.400]  They control who can be there, who can't.
[28:46.400 --> 28:47.680]  They define language.
[28:47.680 --> 28:48.680]  They say you're all right.
[28:48.680 --> 28:50.280]  Then they say that means you're a Nazi.
[28:50.280 --> 28:55.560]  So, you know, you get beat up by crazy people throwing feces at you.
[28:55.560 --> 29:04.520]  But the SPLC calls army bases, quote, Confederate monuments that must be, quote, taken down.
[29:04.520 --> 29:09.080]  Far left group, dog whistle, domestic terrorism.
[29:09.080 --> 29:10.880]  That is exactly what they're doing is dog whistling.
[29:10.880 --> 29:11.880]  And here's the target.
[29:11.880 --> 29:18.360]  Here's the next place to go rant, rave, the military, the most diverse organization in
[29:18.360 --> 29:22.640]  our country, the first thing to be integrated, and it's working just fine.
[29:22.640 --> 29:26.360]  But no, you're going to need some trannies in there and you need to have some race-baiting.
[29:26.360 --> 29:30.520]  You need to turn it into a big social engineering operation for the globalists.
[29:30.520 --> 29:31.520]  That is coming up.
[29:31.520 --> 29:38.720]  Oh, meanwhile, a man has gotten in trouble, has been arrested for eating bacon in front
[29:38.720 --> 29:44.080]  of Muslims in Stockholm, Sweden, of course, the home of the mass Stockholm syndrome.
[29:44.080 --> 29:48.320]  That's all coming up on Alex Jones, infowars.com.
[29:48.320 --> 29:49.640]  We're on the march.
[29:49.640 --> 29:52.120]  The empire's on the run.
[29:52.120 --> 29:56.440]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[29:56.440 --> 30:09.240]  We've got great air filters, great water filters, great non-GMO RLMCs, great books, great films,
[30:09.240 --> 30:11.400]  great patriot apparel to meet like-minded people.
[30:11.400 --> 30:16.320]  We've got a new humongoid sale, not the number of things that are on massive sale, but on
[30:16.320 --> 30:17.320]  what's on sale.
[30:17.320 --> 30:19.560]  Out for months, not been on sale for months and months.
[30:19.560 --> 30:24.640]  We've never offered super male vitality, known concentrated herbs, cold pressed, super male
[30:24.640 --> 30:27.240]  vitality, 57% off.

[30:35.240 --> 30:36.600]  And it's cold pressed.
[30:36.600 --> 30:38.440]  That's why super male is so different.
[30:38.440 --> 30:41.360]  People say, well, I know these compounds work because it's admitted to science and these
[30:41.360 --> 30:44.680]  are other what you sell, they, BuzzFeed said, it's like, it's already best-selling stuff.
[30:44.680 --> 30:46.760]  It's been certified as healthy and good forever.
[30:46.760 --> 30:48.040]  Why these aren't anything new?
[30:48.040 --> 30:52.920]  Because why do something new when you can have the oldest and best, but cold pressed?
[30:52.920 --> 30:55.040]  Do, do.
[30:55.040 --> 31:05.560]  Hey, did you know that you can now preserve your own food for up to 25 years and still

[31:29.800 --> 31:34.800]  And when compared to traditional methods of preservation, like canning or dehydrating,
[31:34.800 --> 31:38.800]  you know, like what you get at the grocery store, there is no comparison.

[32:41.560 --> 32:42.560]  important.
[32:42.560 --> 32:48.000]  The ingredients in vitamin mineral fusion are either plant-derived or of the highest-quality

[32:53.280 --> 32:54.280]  the spear in the InfoWars.
[32:54.280 --> 32:57.520]  That's infowarslife.com and vitamin mineral fusion.
[32:57.520 --> 33:09.480]  You are listening to an InfoWars.com frontline report.
[33:09.480 --> 33:21.120]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[33:21.120 --> 33:31.120]  Deep in the heart of FEMA Region 6, Austin, Texas, transmitting worldwide its Alex Jones.
[33:31.120 --> 33:44.520]  You know, Paul Watson and I are in an unofficial form of competition without even knowing it,
[33:44.520 --> 33:57.080]  because I titled a video yesterday, The Dumbest Anti-Trump Protester in the World.
[33:57.080 --> 34:00.400]  And he had already done a video that I didn't even know about till this morning, because
[34:00.400 --> 34:06.960]  I hadn't been on his YouTube channel, titled, Dumbest Anti-Trump Protesters Ever.
[34:06.960 --> 34:14.360]  So it's a very sad form of competition though, because we don't get off on seeing how incredibly
[34:14.360 --> 34:17.040]  stupid these people are.
[34:17.040 --> 34:28.640]  It actually freaks us out really, really bad, because they are whacked out of their minds.
[34:28.640 --> 34:31.800]  But that video is coming up.
[34:31.800 --> 34:36.800]  But first, I want to play with one of our great new investigative journalists and reporters
[34:36.800 --> 34:48.120]  and Army veteran, Jake Lloyd, went out yesterday and shot the ultimate moron.
[34:48.120 --> 34:52.400]  But actually, maybe not, because a lot of these anti-Trump people aren't even able
[34:52.400 --> 34:54.160]  to talk.
[34:54.160 --> 35:03.320]  And this sad student at the University of Texas thinks Trump stands with Antifa.
[35:03.320 --> 35:08.120]  So we're going to be playing both of those reports here in a minute, so you understand
[35:08.120 --> 35:14.960]  the type of raw ignorance that MSNBC and CNN are controlling.
[35:14.960 --> 35:18.360]  And understand that most of these people don't even get their news from CNN.
[35:18.360 --> 35:25.640]  They get it from The Daily Show, they get it from the different programs that pose as
[35:25.640 --> 35:34.880]  news shows, but are really government propaganda masquerading as a news show posing as comics.
[35:34.880 --> 35:38.680]  That's all they're doing, and they know what they're doing.
[35:38.680 --> 35:45.960]  And so when they say anybody that supports America or supports free market is a Nazi,
[35:45.960 --> 35:51.400]  these knuckle dragon TV heads go out onto the streets of America and believe they're
[35:51.400 --> 35:57.280]  actually fighting Red Skull, Captain America's enemy.
[35:57.280 --> 36:04.320]  And that's what's horrifying is that there is an invincible ignorance to these people.
[36:04.320 --> 36:13.280]  We've gone out and had 99 out of 100 people sign a petition to ban dihydrogen monoxide
[36:13.280 --> 36:21.400]  because it's running off into our water and can cause excessive urination.
[36:21.400 --> 36:25.160]  Leigh Ann McAdoo's done the piece, I've done the piece, same results, Penn and Teller did
[36:25.160 --> 36:29.400]  it first, we just recreated it.
[36:29.400 --> 36:37.040]  She interviewed over 100 people and even one guy hit on her and said, I'm, oh absolutely
[36:37.040 --> 36:38.040]  I want to ban it.
[36:38.040 --> 36:44.120]  I had a chemistry degree from Cornell and she goes, so then you understand you're talking
[36:44.120 --> 36:47.120]  about water and he went, oh my gosh, I'm an idiot.
[36:47.120 --> 36:50.560]  They should go, yeah, let's ban that, absolutely.
[36:50.560 --> 36:56.600]  How about carbon dioxide, absolutely, it's so good, so ban, you know, I think it's carbon
[36:56.600 --> 36:58.720]  monoxide.
[36:58.720 --> 37:06.440]  So that's coming up here in just a few minutes, very, very sad, but it's who we are as a society.
[37:06.440 --> 37:14.760]  And it's what we've bred, it's the domesticated slobs that just want a virtue signal.
[37:14.760 --> 37:20.160]  And they want our guns and they want our free market and they will do whatever George Soros
[37:20.160 --> 37:21.160]  tells them.
[37:21.160 --> 37:27.040]  But how stupid does John Oliver and Trevor Noah and Colbert look going, the president
[37:27.040 --> 37:31.640]  didn't condemn the white supremacist when he did.
[37:31.640 --> 37:35.880]  And how dumb do you look saying Antifa didn't do anything wrong when everyone knows they
[37:35.880 --> 37:38.440]  are the scourge of this country.
[37:38.440 --> 37:40.960]  They are the trash of the trash.
[37:40.960 --> 37:43.440]  They are the ne'er-do-wells of the ne'er-do-wells.
[37:43.440 --> 37:50.160]  They are an amalgamation of devil worshipers, communists, drug addicts, thugs that want
[37:50.160 --> 38:01.240]  an excuse to go out in a gang of cowards and attack people individually.
[38:01.240 --> 38:06.280]  They are the definition of scum of the earth.
[38:06.280 --> 38:09.200]  And they don't even know that we're barreling towards a war in North Korea.
[38:09.200 --> 38:13.480]  They're cheering on the economy collapsing, even though it'll hurt them, because they
[38:13.480 --> 38:19.320]  believe they're going to have a metaphysical or existential coming of age if they can bring
[38:19.320 --> 38:23.760]  down Trump, because Hillary was their mommy, even though in the WikiLeaks she says she
[38:23.760 --> 38:28.760]  hates them and their losers, even though she has disdain for them.
[38:28.760 --> 38:38.200]  That's too kind of a word, even though she has disgust for them.
[38:38.200 --> 38:47.040]  Their mommy lost, their power lost, their feeling good, their reflected glory failed.
[38:47.040 --> 38:52.720]  And now all they want is to pull down all that is strong and honorable if you're some
[38:52.720 --> 38:59.800]  drug addict, devil worshipper, loser.
[38:59.800 --> 39:06.960]  What do you think of people with happy, healthy families going to the golf course on the weekend
[39:06.960 --> 39:10.880]  or going duck hunting on the weekend or going out and feeding the homeless on the weekend
[39:10.880 --> 39:16.240]  or going to the bowling alley, just having a good time?
[39:16.240 --> 39:20.560]  What do they think of you that has your head screwed on straight, just wants to be a good
[39:20.560 --> 39:21.800]  member of society?
[39:21.800 --> 39:27.240]  They hate you because they're losers and they gather together in big groups to take control
[39:27.240 --> 39:32.480]  of government and culture so that they can rule and feel powerful and become what they're
[39:32.480 --> 39:33.480]  not.
[39:33.480 --> 39:40.000]  They want power but not responsibility.
[39:40.000 --> 39:46.280]  And they look at you and they see the enemy and you've given them a finger, not the middle
[39:46.280 --> 39:50.320]  finger, you've given them a pinky of power, you've acquiesced to their bullying, you've
[39:50.320 --> 39:53.960]  used the words and the terms they wanted.
[39:53.960 --> 39:58.560]  They told you, repudiate the Nazis, you're like, yeah, I don't like the Nazis, sure.
[39:58.560 --> 40:06.320]  All right, repudiate the family, repudiate free market, repudiate God, repudiate free
[40:06.320 --> 40:13.920]  speech, talk exactly as we say, follow our orders, grovel to us, you're like, I'm not
[40:13.920 --> 40:14.920]  going to do that.
[40:14.920 --> 40:17.600]  And they go, you know what, then we're going to hit you in the head with a club or a bike
[40:17.600 --> 40:24.440]  lock, we're going to throw feces on you, like satanic monkeys, and we're going to take control
[40:24.440 --> 40:34.120]  of government as if you, the scummiest, ne'er-do-well, race-baiting filth of the earth, the droppings
[40:34.120 --> 40:41.920]  of an old twisted Nazi collaborator, the skin flakes that fall off the butt of George
[40:41.920 --> 40:50.920]  Soros and his little gremlin son, you are the literal servants of the vampire pedophile
[40:50.920 --> 40:53.560]  class.
[40:53.560 --> 40:59.400]  And so you look exactly what you think servants of vampires would look like, super white skin
[40:59.400 --> 41:06.440]  at the point it's green, black hoods, stinking, hating, attacking, viciously, covering your
[41:06.440 --> 41:15.840]  faces, and I'm not bashing people that like to wear black or like horror films or, you
[41:15.840 --> 41:16.840]  know, whatever.
[41:16.840 --> 41:21.760]  I'm talking about the particular folks that have taken on that garb as a group and who
[41:21.760 --> 41:27.000]  go out hissing and attacking and viciously striking out and claiming that they're the
[41:27.000 --> 41:32.520]  guardians and the holders of all that's good and all that's cultural and they will dictate
[41:32.520 --> 41:37.920]  to everyone the way it is and they're going to pull down civilization and somehow they're
[41:37.920 --> 41:41.280]  going to rule this new dark age.
[41:41.280 --> 41:48.760]  Well, they've been rejected, so I'm going to play those clips in a moment, but first,
[41:48.760 --> 41:52.640]  limited time flash special, it will end on Monday because we have to, because we're selling

[44:00.760 --> 44:07.440]  one of the top ones in the country, you heard the Patriot CEO on this week, and then we

[45:39.120 --> 45:44.240]  the absolute best deals that have been on the fence, similar bone broth formulas aren't even
[45:44.240 --> 45:50.640]  as strong or 60 to 70 dollars, this is way below half that, infowarsstore.com, I'ma stop
[45:50.640 --> 46:00.720]  right now, I don't take pleasure in how ignorant these people are, but they're dangerous, here
[46:00.720 --> 46:06.600]  is Paul's video, then I'm gonna play the even crazier one, where the leftist are blaming
[46:06.600 --> 46:11.000]  Trump for Antifa, saying they work for him, you see the moment the left then says the
[46:11.000 --> 46:15.800]  antifa's bad, oh now they work for Trump, see everything's insane asylum, or you just
[46:15.800 --> 46:19.160]  like the tea party that they're having in Alice in Wonderland, you just make up whatever
[46:19.160 --> 46:24.480]  you want, like you're on 14 hits of acid, but that's how they all are, almost all students
[46:24.480 --> 46:29.040]  at UT are the stupidest people, I could walk into some auto apart store and talk to guys,
[46:29.040 --> 46:32.800]  they'd be super on target, street wise, know what's going on, cause they got a family,
[46:32.800 --> 46:36.280]  they got kids, they got a paycheck, they got to make their job in their hooves, but you
[46:36.280 --> 46:41.160]  talk to these zombies and they're arrested development at the colleges, it is a joke,
[46:41.160 --> 46:49.600]  now let's go ahead and go to Paul's video, the dumbest anti-Trump protestors ever, so
[46:49.600 --> 46:54.040]  now that the left is finally being forced to disavow Antifa, the anti-Trump movement
[46:54.040 --> 47:00.400]  can return to its credible, rational, intelligent roots, right, do you always make fart noises
[47:00.400 --> 47:08.080]  with your mouth, wrong, what kind of job could this woman have given that she's so adept
[47:08.080 --> 47:13.200]  at reasoned forthright debate, I wonder, I'm a professor at the University of Texas, yeah
[47:13.200 --> 47:16.920]  she's teaching your kids, you want to know what I teach, political science, no I don't
[47:16.920 --> 47:21.840]  teach political science, what do you teach, why do you think I stand here, I don't know
[47:21.840 --> 47:28.080]  what do you teach, what do you think she teaches, take a wild guess, and his gender studies,
[47:28.080 --> 47:33.140]  well imagine my shock, but being a professor at least you must understand the value of
[47:33.140 --> 47:46.700]  free speech, right?
[47:46.700 --> 47:49.700]  People, he would have had Ben Carson on his team, deal with that.
[47:49.700 --> 47:50.700]  Oh, he's not a black person.
[47:50.700 --> 47:53.700]  Ben Carson is not a black person.
[47:53.700 --> 47:55.700]  He's not a black person.
[47:55.700 --> 47:57.700]  He's not a black person.
[47:58.700 --> 47:59.700]  Wow.
[47:59.700 --> 48:01.700]  He is a dimwit.
[48:01.700 --> 48:06.700]  That's odd, because on Wikipedia it says that he's actually a Yale graduate and a brain surgeon.
[48:06.700 --> 48:09.700]  He's a neurosurgeon, but he's been some...
[48:09.700 --> 48:20.700]  He's as dumb as a box of rocks.
[48:20.700 --> 48:21.700]  Yeah, all right.
[48:21.700 --> 48:23.700]  But you, though. How about you?
[48:23.700 --> 48:24.700]  What about me?
[48:24.700 --> 48:25.700]  What are you good at?
[48:25.700 --> 48:26.700]  Well, I...
[48:26.700 --> 48:33.700]  She's good at calling herself an anti-racist while simultaneously disparaging, educated, successful black people.
[48:33.700 --> 48:35.700]  What do we do this hate mongering here?
[48:35.700 --> 48:36.700]  Smarmy little prick.
[48:36.700 --> 48:38.700]  Get the f*** out of my city, you prick.
[48:38.700 --> 48:39.700]  You gotta spread love, y'all.
[48:39.700 --> 48:40.700]  Are you spreading love?
[48:40.700 --> 48:41.700]  Are you spreading love?
[48:41.700 --> 48:42.700]  What you're doing is incredibly hateful.
[48:42.700 --> 48:43.700]  You prick.
[48:43.700 --> 48:44.700]  Are you spreading love?
[48:44.700 --> 48:45.700]  Are you spreading love?
[48:45.700 --> 48:46.700]  Get the f*** out of my city.
[48:46.700 --> 48:47.700]  Are you spreading love?
[48:47.700 --> 48:48.700]  Are you spreading love?
[48:48.700 --> 48:49.700]  You gotta spread love.
[48:49.700 --> 48:50.700]  Why do you want Trump impeached?
[48:50.700 --> 48:51.700]  You died it.
[48:51.700 --> 48:52.700]  We'll never be divided.
[48:52.700 --> 48:54.700]  They're meanwhile dividing people over Trump.
[48:54.700 --> 48:55.700]  You died it.
[48:55.700 --> 48:56.700]  We'll never...
[48:56.700 --> 48:57.700]  She's a total mental illness.
[48:57.700 --> 48:58.700]  Back that up.
[48:58.700 --> 48:59.700]  Thirty seconds, please.
[49:04.700 --> 49:06.700]  They're saying, F.U., we're gonna get you.
[49:06.700 --> 49:07.700]  Get out of here.
[49:07.700 --> 49:11.700]  You have no right to be here while cussing at him and spitting in his face and stuff.
[49:11.700 --> 49:15.700]  And then when they do it, they say, oh, see, you're spreading the love.
[49:15.700 --> 49:22.700]  This is the Harry Potter universe where these people just make stuff up as they go along.
[49:22.700 --> 49:25.700]  They're attacking him.
[49:25.700 --> 49:27.700]  They're the fascist.
[49:27.700 --> 49:30.700]  But they would call themselves the anti-fascists.
[49:30.700 --> 49:36.700]  He's out there really to get their views, but could find no one that would talk other
[49:36.700 --> 49:41.700]  than screaming, hey, Millie found one guy that would talk and they ended up being friends
[49:41.700 --> 49:42.700]  when she went out.
[49:42.700 --> 49:44.700]  We really want to hear from you.
[49:44.700 --> 49:46.700]  In fact, we want to interface with you.
[49:46.700 --> 49:49.700]  But I know the leftist groups that bust you out there and pay for a lot of you to be there
[49:49.700 --> 49:53.700]  tell you in their literature, don't talk to the opposition.
[49:53.700 --> 49:54.700]  They're Nazis.
[49:54.700 --> 49:56.700]  That's because they want to keep you in the cult.
[49:56.700 --> 49:58.700]  What's the number one thing about a cult?
[49:58.700 --> 50:02.700]  It tells you don't talk to other people.
[50:02.700 --> 50:03.700]  Don't debate.
[50:03.700 --> 50:04.700]  Just have slogans.
[50:04.700 --> 50:06.700]  Let's go back to Paul's piece.
[50:06.700 --> 50:07.700]  What do we do this hate mongering?
[50:07.700 --> 50:08.700]  You're a smarmy little prick.
[50:08.700 --> 50:10.700]  Get the f*** out of my city, you prick.
[50:10.700 --> 50:12.700]  You've got to spread love, y'all.
[50:12.700 --> 50:13.700]  Are you spreading love?
[50:13.700 --> 50:15.700]  What you're doing is incredibly hateful.
[50:15.700 --> 50:17.700]  Are you spreading love?
[50:17.700 --> 50:18.700]  Get the f*** out of my city.
[50:18.700 --> 50:20.700]  Are you spreading love?
[50:20.700 --> 50:22.700]  Why do you want Trump impeached?
[50:22.700 --> 50:25.700]  United will never be divided.
[50:25.700 --> 50:27.700]  They're meanwhile dividing people over Trump.
[50:27.700 --> 50:29.700]  United will never be divided.
[50:29.700 --> 50:30.700]  As they divide over Trump.
[50:30.700 --> 50:35.700]  But let's be fair, at least when they were asked a specific question
[50:35.700 --> 50:37.700]  why they thought Trump should be impeached,
[50:37.700 --> 50:39.700]  the answers were clear and cogent.
[50:39.700 --> 50:44.700]  Do you believe Trump should be impeached?
[50:44.700 --> 50:46.700]  That's a UT professor.
[50:46.700 --> 50:50.700]  Do you make fart noises with your mouth?
[50:50.700 --> 50:52.700]  I'm asking people why they want Trump impeached
[50:52.700 --> 50:54.700]  and nobody can answer the question.
[50:54.700 --> 50:57.700]  Can you stop blowing at me?
[50:57.700 --> 50:59.700]  Where did you go to college?
[50:59.700 --> 51:06.700]  Where did you get your education?
[51:06.700 --> 51:08.700]  Why do you want Trump impeached?
[51:08.700 --> 51:10.700]  I don't know, man. Why do you think?
[51:10.700 --> 51:13.700]  You're so dumb. You are really dumb.
[51:13.700 --> 51:14.700]  For real.
[51:14.700 --> 51:18.700]  All the signs say impeached Trump and I'm trying to figure out why.
[51:18.700 --> 51:20.700]  That's still not an argument.
[51:20.700 --> 51:21.700]  So why should Trump be impeached?
[51:21.700 --> 51:23.700]  Because he's lied a thousand times on record.
[51:23.700 --> 51:25.700]  What does he lie about?
[51:25.700 --> 51:27.700]  F*** you, scum.
[51:27.700 --> 51:29.700]  You've got a liar.
[51:29.700 --> 51:30.700]  I know, so it keeps coming back.
[51:30.700 --> 51:34.700]  So what do you lie about?
[51:34.700 --> 51:38.700]  You've got to see the video.
[51:38.700 --> 51:40.700]  Paul is, oh, and teaming up is incredible.
[51:40.700 --> 51:41.700]  But you're out here protesting.
[51:41.700 --> 51:42.700]  You shouldn't have to look it up.
[51:42.700 --> 51:44.700]  You know, you should already know your cause, don't you think?
[51:44.700 --> 51:46.700]  You're probably, you know, right?
[51:46.700 --> 51:49.700]  You're probably, you know, right?
[51:49.700 --> 51:50.700]  I mean, if you have to look it up,
[51:50.700 --> 51:54.700]  it must not be that important to you, you know?
[51:54.700 --> 51:59.700]  You can't say where the road goes.
[51:59.700 --> 52:00.700]  Do you support America, sir?
[52:00.700 --> 52:01.700]  I support America all the way.
[52:01.700 --> 52:02.700]  Freedom of speech.
[52:02.700 --> 52:04.700]  Yeah, you love freedom of speech so much.
[52:04.700 --> 52:05.700]  You love it so much.
[52:05.700 --> 52:10.700]  You're physically trying to block someone else's freedom of speech.
[52:10.700 --> 52:12.700]  You have kids.
[52:12.700 --> 52:16.700]  You have a family.
[52:16.700 --> 52:20.700]  Hello, darkness, my old friend.
[52:20.700 --> 52:23.700]  Hey, can you tell me why Trump should be impeached, ma'am?
[52:23.700 --> 52:24.700]  Still over.
[52:24.700 --> 52:27.700]  Hey, why should Trump be impeached?
[52:27.700 --> 52:29.700]  Donald Trump has got to.
[52:29.700 --> 52:30.700]  No.
[52:30.700 --> 52:32.700]  So you are out here supporting President Trump?
[52:32.700 --> 52:33.700]  Yep.
[52:33.700 --> 52:34.700]  America first policy?
[52:34.700 --> 52:35.700]  Exactly.
[52:35.700 --> 52:36.700]  Thank you.
[52:36.700 --> 52:37.700]  Thank you.
[52:37.700 --> 52:38.700]  Yeah.
[52:38.700 --> 52:39.700]  What's this?
[52:39.700 --> 52:40.700]  Using intimidation to shut down people of color?
[52:40.700 --> 52:42.700]  You should come out here with all these crazed protesters.
[52:42.700 --> 52:43.700]  Hey, you can wash out.
[52:43.700 --> 52:44.700]  Yeah, do me a favor.
[52:44.700 --> 52:45.700]  Check that white privilege.
[52:45.700 --> 52:46.700]  So let me get this straight.
[52:46.700 --> 52:48.700]  What's left of the anti-Trump movement?
[52:48.700 --> 52:52.700]  The same movement that has hysterical tantrums about Trump and his supporters
[52:52.700 --> 52:55.700]  being hateful trampling on rights and silencing minorities
[52:55.700 --> 52:59.700]  is a hateful mob that tramples on people's rights and silences minorities.
[52:59.700 --> 53:02.700]  And they blame Antifa for discrediting the left.
[53:02.700 --> 53:04.700]  Yeah, forget about Antifa.
[53:04.700 --> 53:09.700]  You're doing a pretty damn fine job of discrediting yourselves.
[53:11.700 --> 53:17.700]  Antifa is just the latest droppings of the mainline left.
[53:17.700 --> 53:29.700]  Dirty, stupid, mentally ill, confused, ignorant, hateful, violent, arrogant, entitled.
[53:31.700 --> 53:32.700]  No logic.
[53:32.700 --> 53:35.700]  Like Spock is a 10 on the logic scale.
[53:35.700 --> 53:38.700]  The leftist are a zero.
[53:38.700 --> 53:41.700]  There's just no logic with these people.
[53:41.700 --> 53:46.700]  Now, let's get to an even sicker video.
[53:46.700 --> 53:50.700]  Sad, liberal student thinks Trump stands with Antifa.
[53:50.700 --> 53:56.700]  And this is just a snapshot that Jake Lloyd, one of our newest and awesome reporters,
[53:56.700 --> 53:59.700]  everybody here is awesome, but what a great new crew member.
[53:59.700 --> 54:01.700]  Everybody doing such a great job in putting up with me.
[54:01.700 --> 54:05.700]  Let's go ahead and go to, this is UT yesterday.
[54:05.700 --> 54:10.700]  See, our problem is Owen got back with two hours of footage and uploaded it.
[54:10.700 --> 54:12.700]  And he was in 20 minute chunks.
[54:12.700 --> 54:17.700]  And this one got 300,000, this one got 200,000, this one got 100,000, this one got 300,000,
[54:17.700 --> 54:19.700]  this one got 90,000 or so.
[54:19.700 --> 54:22.700]  And I'm like, I understand you work till 10 at night and you're awesome, Owen.
[54:22.700 --> 54:27.700]  We're going to get you an assistant who will then grow and become as successful as you, hopefully.
[54:27.700 --> 54:31.700]  I got folks that are lead producers now that were interns here two years ago.
[54:31.700 --> 54:32.700]  I'm just looking for talent.
[54:32.700 --> 54:36.700]  You can be a woman, you can be Hispanic, you can be black, you can be white, you can be Russian,
[54:36.700 --> 54:40.700]  you can be Chinese, you want to fight tyranny, you want to work.
[54:40.700 --> 54:42.700]  Baby, I love you.
[54:42.700 --> 54:47.700]  But the point is, is that I said, I guarantee you, if you'd have edited just one of these down,
[54:47.700 --> 54:50.700]  it would get 10 million views and then we'd reach more people.
[54:50.700 --> 54:53.700]  And they're like, no, you're right, Alex, we just have to upload it raw.
[54:53.700 --> 54:54.700]  I said, it didn't matter.
[54:54.700 --> 54:59.700]  Somebody else will grab that and edit it and put it out awesome on their channel.
[54:59.700 --> 55:00.700]  And I want that to happen.
[55:00.700 --> 55:01.700]  And it was Paul Watson.
[55:01.700 --> 55:04.700]  No communication with Paul, it just happened.
[55:04.700 --> 55:07.700]  Because they were asking, I go, what should the headlines be, boss?
[55:07.700 --> 55:09.700]  And I said, well, you're as good as I am, Owen.
[55:09.700 --> 55:15.700]  But I said, let's go with dumbest liberal protesters ever.
[55:15.700 --> 55:19.700]  Paul Watson, without even the same headline or a little bit different.
[55:19.700 --> 55:22.700]  He said, Trump protesters.
[55:22.700 --> 55:23.700]  So I've already gone through far.
[55:23.700 --> 55:30.700]  I've got to come back and air this piece with liberal student thinks Trump stands with Antifa.
[55:30.700 --> 55:32.700]  And just the death of the logic.
[55:32.700 --> 55:35.700]  And you got to understand, we didn't go find some poor brain damage,
[55:35.700 --> 55:40.700]  electro shock therapy victim from the 70s, you know, like a third of the schizophrenics are
[55:40.700 --> 55:43.700]  that were dumped out of the state hospital in the 90s that like,
[55:43.700 --> 55:47.700]  troll around Austin, Texas that I genuinely give money to and try to help out.
[55:47.700 --> 55:50.700]  I don't give money to the crackheads or the drunks.
[55:50.700 --> 55:53.700]  I know sometimes they're honest and you got a sign begging for a six pack.
[55:53.700 --> 55:54.700]  I'll give them 10 bucks.
[55:54.700 --> 55:59.700]  But the point is, is that I do try to help out the schizophrenics,
[55:59.700 --> 56:04.700]  but we're not out there trolling for schizophrenics by,
[56:04.700 --> 56:07.700]  by all my lucky stars.
[56:07.700 --> 56:10.700]  If you go down to UT effect, I want to do this the next week or two.
[56:10.700 --> 56:13.700]  And you just sit there for three hours.
[56:13.700 --> 56:15.700]  I will be attacked.
[56:15.700 --> 56:16.700]  I will be spit on.
[56:16.700 --> 56:18.700]  I will be cussed at.
[56:18.700 --> 56:19.700]  I will be called a Nazi.
[56:19.700 --> 56:25.700]  I would guess them out there three hours, I'd say 200 times.
[56:25.700 --> 56:29.700]  And then I'll have some fans come over as well that are going to be totally well spoken.
[56:29.700 --> 56:33.700]  In fact, I want to do a live feed sometime unannounced.
[56:33.700 --> 56:39.700]  Unscripted at UT with a camera live streaming on Facebook mentions.
[56:39.700 --> 56:42.700]  And I'm going to illustrate this to everybody.
[56:42.700 --> 56:47.700]  Then we're going to go back to this date, September 1st and play this clip from them,
[56:47.700 --> 56:52.700]  from the vault of my prediction coming true, that none of them will be able to talk.
[56:52.700 --> 56:54.700]  None of them will be able to say anything.
[56:54.700 --> 56:59.700]  Some will try to get physical and that none of them will be intellectual.
[56:59.700 --> 57:04.700]  And every person that's a listener will be incredibly intellectual and incredibly informed.
[57:04.700 --> 57:05.700]  And they're going to be black.
[57:05.700 --> 57:06.700]  They're going to be white.
[57:06.700 --> 57:07.700]  They're going to be Hispanic.
[57:07.700 --> 57:08.700]  They're going to be Asian.
[57:08.700 --> 57:13.700]  We will have a diverse group of people that will all be well spoken.
[57:13.700 --> 57:21.700]  And then all of their supporters, the state, the globalist supporters, will be drooling nincompoops.
[57:21.700 --> 57:23.700]  And again, why do I illustrate this?
[57:23.700 --> 57:27.700]  Because if we show people who liberals are, and if we show them who Antifa is,
[57:27.700 --> 57:34.700]  and if we show them who the zombies are at these colleges, we will be able to wake up the world.
[57:34.700 --> 57:36.700]  Now, I'm not even going to do an intro next segment.
[57:36.700 --> 57:39.700]  Some stations don't carry it, but I'm going to come in and play it.
[57:39.700 --> 57:41.700]  And the full video is on infowars.com.
[57:41.700 --> 57:46.700]  I'm going to come right in with this piece when we come back in a few minutes.
[57:46.700 --> 57:50.700]  Sad, liberal student thinks Trump stands with Antifa.
[57:50.700 --> 57:52.700]  And then we've got James Leslie Rawls.
[57:52.700 --> 57:59.700]  He predicted the summer of rage a year ago that they would try if Trump got elected to overthrow him with communist groups.
[57:59.700 --> 58:01.700]  He's predicted it in triplicate.
[58:01.700 --> 58:03.700]  And he's been really predicting it the last six months.
[58:03.700 --> 58:05.700]  He'll be joining us.
[58:05.700 --> 58:15.700]  Austin Fletcher, Jack Pasobic, Arthur Chopper, Mike Sernovich, and more today.
[58:15.700 --> 58:17.700]  So you'll definitely want to stay with us.
[58:17.700 --> 58:20.700]  And I tend to get some phones open as well.
[58:20.700 --> 58:25.700]  The House is to vote on self-driving car legislation to force the robot takeover.
[58:25.700 --> 58:27.700]  That's all coming up as well.
[58:27.700 --> 58:29.700]  So much to cover.
[58:29.700 --> 58:35.700]  As the SPLC calls for our U.S. military bases to be closed because they're named after Confederate generals,
[58:35.700 --> 58:38.700]  they'll be right back with hour number two.
[58:38.700 --> 58:42.700]  You are listening to GCN.
[58:42.700 --> 58:49.700]  Visit GCNLive.com today.
[58:49.700 --> 58:54.700]  As most of you already know, I am a voracious consumer of news and information.
[58:54.700 --> 58:57.700]  And in the last four or five years doing more and more research,
[58:57.700 --> 59:02.700]  I came across the fact that the elite establishment is fully aware of the fact
[59:02.700 --> 59:07.700]  that our ancient ancestors, in many cases, had much better nutrition than we do today.
[59:07.700 --> 59:14.700]  And our ancient ancestors sought out the bones of the animals that they were hunting, killing, and then processing.
[59:14.700 --> 59:20.700]  I set out to develop Caveman, but to not just have concentrated bone broth from chicken,
[59:20.700 --> 59:27.700]  but seven other superfood ingredients known for cleansing and supercharging the body at the same time.
[59:27.700 --> 59:30.700]  Info Wars isn't just fighting the globalist.
[59:30.700 --> 59:35.700]  We're getting results and we're expanding in the face of the complete media assault
[59:35.700 --> 59:38.700]  and winning because of your support.
[59:38.700 --> 59:40.700]  Caveman is back in stock people.
[59:40.700 --> 59:41.700]  Absolutely love it.
[59:41.700 --> 59:45.700]  So please secure your Caveman today at infowarslife.com
[59:45.700 --> 59:51.700]  or by calling toll-free AAA-253-3139.
[59:51.700 --> 59:56.700]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[59:56.700 --> 01:00:08.700]  He aligns himself with the truth
[01:00:08.700 --> 01:00:11.700]  and it's time for you to choose a side.
[01:00:11.700 --> 01:00:15.700]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[01:00:15.700 --> 01:00:19.700]  So are you familiar with the events that went down in Charlottesville, Virginia?
[01:00:19.700 --> 01:00:20.700]  Yes.
[01:00:20.700 --> 01:00:24.700]  What's the brief summary of what happened there as far as you know?
[01:00:24.700 --> 01:00:30.700]  Well, what I know was apparently some people founded upon themselves to get together
[01:00:30.700 --> 01:00:33.700]  and kind of just protest against race.
[01:00:33.700 --> 01:00:34.700]  Wait, wait, wait.
[01:00:34.700 --> 01:00:36.700]  Come on, try getting it out.
[01:00:36.700 --> 01:00:39.700]  I'm trying to think of the words.
[01:00:39.700 --> 01:00:41.700]  Try getting it out.
[01:00:41.700 --> 01:00:42.700]  That's fine.
[01:00:42.700 --> 01:00:47.700]  So basically there was an event that was, there were some white nationalists and stuff there
[01:00:47.700 --> 01:00:53.700]  and then of course that type of event will attract like Klansmen and Nazis and stuff.
[01:00:53.700 --> 01:00:58.700]  They were just protesting out there and there was another group that came out to protest them.
[01:00:58.700 --> 01:01:00.700]  There was a radical communist group called Antifa.
[01:01:00.700 --> 01:01:01.700]  Are you very familiar with them?
[01:01:01.700 --> 01:01:03.700]  A little bit, a little bit.
[01:01:03.700 --> 01:01:05.700]  What do you know about them? Anything?
[01:01:05.700 --> 01:01:12.700]  Not very, not so much, but just that they're kind of under the same guidelines as like the evangelicalists
[01:01:12.700 --> 01:01:18.700]  and like the KKK and stuff like that, you know, they're just really white power and stuff like that.
[01:01:18.700 --> 01:01:19.700]  Antifa's white power?
[01:01:19.700 --> 01:01:27.700]  Okay, so now after this last event that happened this weekend, there was a patriot prayer event.
[01:01:27.700 --> 01:01:33.700]  That's the organization that held the event and Antifa came out and they decided to crash this event.
[01:01:33.700 --> 01:01:35.700]  You know, there were a lot of speakers of a lot of different colors.
[01:01:35.700 --> 01:01:41.700]  There was even a trans speaker up there and they decided to come out and do violence and destroy property
[01:01:41.700 --> 01:01:43.700]  and beat people with clubs and pour urine on people.
[01:01:43.700 --> 01:01:48.700]  First of all, do you think that that's like an appropriate way for Americans to do political discourse?
[01:01:48.700 --> 01:01:49.700]  No, not at all.
[01:01:49.700 --> 01:01:52.700]  I think here in America people should be able to be who they are.
[01:01:52.700 --> 01:01:55.700]  That's kind of what the land of the free is supposed to be and all.
[01:01:55.700 --> 01:01:59.700]  You should be able to have your own religion, own race, but we're all the same.
[01:01:59.700 --> 01:02:01.700]  You're a white male!
[01:02:01.700 --> 01:02:08.700]  And how do you feel about President Trump's comments on Charlottesville that said both sides were violent, both sides should be condemned?
[01:02:08.700 --> 01:02:09.700]  I think it was awful.
[01:02:09.700 --> 01:02:13.700]  I think there was an obvious side that was wrong and an obvious side that was doing...
[01:02:13.700 --> 01:02:16.700]  Like clearly Antifa and all the other groups were wrong, right?
[01:02:16.700 --> 01:02:17.700]  Yes, of course.
[01:02:17.700 --> 01:02:20.700]  Yeah, we can't tolerate that kind of racism in America.
[01:02:20.700 --> 01:02:30.700]  Now, a lot of congressmen and women like Nancy Pelosi, a lot of the mainstream media have come out and denounced this group, Antifa,
[01:02:30.700 --> 01:02:33.700]  because they were the ones doing the violence in California this weekend.
[01:02:33.700 --> 01:02:38.700]  Do you think that we need to have more politicians and media personalities come out and denounce them?
[01:02:38.700 --> 01:02:39.700]  Yes, of course.
[01:02:39.700 --> 01:02:45.700]  I think the more that come out and denounce them, the better this problem could be solved and stuff like that.
[01:02:45.700 --> 01:02:48.700]  What do you think Donald Trump should say about Antifa?
[01:02:48.700 --> 01:02:53.700]  Do you think that his silence on the matter speaks to who he's really on, whose side he's really on?
[01:02:53.700 --> 01:02:56.700]  Yes, his silence definitely speaks to the side that he's on.
[01:02:56.700 --> 01:03:07.700]  I think he should definitely come out with the speech or address the country and just explain that this isn't acceptable.
[01:03:07.700 --> 01:03:09.700]  Be the president he's supposed to be.
[01:03:09.700 --> 01:03:15.700]  Do you think you should call out Antifa by name and declare them a domestic terrorist organization if they're going to come out and do this kind of violence?
[01:03:15.700 --> 01:03:23.700]  Personally, I think so, but there's a lot of controversy and stuff like that, so I assume that he probably wouldn't, but...
[01:03:23.700 --> 01:03:26.700]  They've got love, they've got everything.
[01:03:26.700 --> 01:03:28.700]  Antifa!
[01:03:28.700 --> 01:03:29.700]  Alright, absolutely.
[01:03:29.700 --> 01:03:37.700]  Like I said a minute ago, we cannot tolerate white supremacists like Antifa and the KKK to keep destroying American property and stuff.
[01:03:37.700 --> 01:03:44.700]  Is there anything else you want to say on the state of political violence in America or Donald Trump or any of these things?
[01:03:44.700 --> 01:03:46.700]  I did not vote for him.
[01:03:46.700 --> 01:03:48.700]  Who did you vote for?
[01:03:48.700 --> 01:03:49.700]  Clinton.
[01:03:49.700 --> 01:03:52.700]  Clinton, what did you like about Clinton over Trump?
[01:03:52.700 --> 01:03:56.700]  She had political experience and stuff like that.
[01:03:56.700 --> 01:04:00.700]  She was in the mix of everything for quite a while.
[01:04:00.700 --> 01:04:04.700]  She knew the secret, she knew how to run a government and stuff like that.
[01:04:04.700 --> 01:04:07.700]  Yeah, there was still the scandalous stuff about her.
[01:04:07.700 --> 01:04:10.700]  What difference at this point does it make?
[01:04:10.700 --> 01:04:14.700]  She never acted like a child, like Donald Trump and stuff like that.
[01:04:14.700 --> 01:04:16.700]  She had real political experience.
[01:04:16.700 --> 01:04:20.700]  If you look at how she handled the Benghazi situation, she did wonderfully, stuff like that.
[01:04:20.700 --> 01:04:23.700]  Yes.
[01:04:23.700 --> 01:04:30.700]  Yeah, Benghazi was really proved exactly how good she could be and how qualified she was for the position.
[01:04:30.700 --> 01:04:32.700]  But anyways, is there anything else you'd like to say in closing?
[01:04:32.700 --> 01:04:33.700]  No, thank you.
[01:04:33.700 --> 01:04:35.700]  Alright, well thank you very much, I appreciate it.
[01:04:35.700 --> 01:04:42.700]  You know, someone very profoundly once said many years ago that if fascism ever comes to America, it will come in the name of liberalism.
[01:04:42.700 --> 01:04:46.700]  You're not a journalist!
[01:04:46.700 --> 01:04:47.700]  I'm a journalist!
[01:04:47.700 --> 01:04:49.700]  Dude, you're not a journalist!
[01:04:49.700 --> 01:04:50.700]  Does mommy not hook you enough?
[01:04:50.700 --> 01:04:53.700]  Mommy believes you're a f***ing journalist, you're a f***ing head!
[01:05:00.700 --> 01:05:07.700]  We've got great air filters, great water filters, great non-GMO heirloom seeds, great books, great films, great patriot apparel to meet like-minded people.
[01:05:07.700 --> 01:05:13.700]  We've got a new humongoid sale, not a number of things that are on massive sale, but on what's on sale?
[01:05:13.700 --> 01:05:15.700]  Out for months, not been on sale for months and months.
[01:05:15.700 --> 01:05:23.700]  We've never offered super male vitality, known concentrated herbs, cold pressed, super male vitality, 57% off.
[01:05:23.700 --> 01:05:24.700]  It's never been the price.
[01:05:24.700 --> 01:05:31.700]  It is right now with 3,596 reviews, 4.6 reviews total by third party sites, unprecedented.
[01:05:31.700 --> 01:05:32.700]  And it's cold pressed.
[01:05:32.700 --> 01:05:34.700]  That's why super male is so different.
[01:05:34.700 --> 01:05:38.700]  People say, well, I know these compounds work because it's admitted to science and these are what you sell.
[01:05:38.700 --> 01:05:40.700]  Buzzfeed said it's like, it's already best-selling stuff.
[01:05:40.700 --> 01:05:42.700]  It's been certified as healthy and good forever.
[01:05:42.700 --> 01:05:44.700]  Why these aren't anything new?
[01:05:44.700 --> 01:05:48.700]  Why do something new when you can have the oldest and best butt cold pressed?
[01:05:48.700 --> 01:05:50.700]  Do, do.
[01:05:57.700 --> 01:06:01.700]  Thousands of years ago, there was a basic form of chivalry.
[01:06:01.700 --> 01:06:08.700]  Our ancestors would hear the drums of war, giving the warriors of the tribe a chance to organize and prepare a defense.
[01:06:08.700 --> 01:06:17.700]  60 years ago, when foreign air forces were approaching filled with bombs, they had drums of their own, air raid sirens.
[01:06:17.700 --> 01:06:21.700]  But in the 21st century, there are silent weapons for quiet war.
[01:06:21.700 --> 01:06:31.700]  Pathogens added to the food and water, into the lining of plastics that destroy our vitality, turn off our hormones and accelerate our journey towards death.
[01:06:31.700 --> 01:06:46.700]  I personally counter this onslaught with Anthroplex. Anthroplex is designed with known, organic, concentrated herbs to create the basic foundation to normal metabolic activity inside the human body.
[01:06:46.700 --> 01:06:49.700]  Discover why Anthroplex has turned so many heads today.
[01:06:49.700 --> 01:06:55.700]  It's time for us to take our bodies back into our own hands and it starts at infowarslife.com with Anthroplex.
[01:06:55.700 --> 01:07:02.700]  It's not just our water we need to filter, it's not just our food that needs to be cleaned, it's the air we're breathing, especially for our children.
[01:07:02.700 --> 01:07:08.700]  The artificial particulates of the chemicals is absolutely weighing down our immune systems.
[01:07:08.700 --> 01:07:17.700]  The same team based right here in America that brought you the Alexa Pure Groundbreaking Water Filtration Systems have now developed Alexa Pure Breeze.
[01:07:17.700 --> 01:07:25.700]  Whether it's your home or office, you owe it to yourself, your coworkers, your family, your children, to the best job you can to purify your air.
[01:07:25.700 --> 01:07:33.700]  The elite are masters at poisoning our environment, while themselves doing things that mitigate or avoid most toxic effects for themselves.
[01:07:33.700 --> 01:07:35.700]  The general public doesn't.
[01:07:35.700 --> 01:07:39.700]  The Alexa Pure Breeze would be a steal at $300, $400, $500.
[01:07:39.700 --> 01:07:49.700]  One of these systems can keep 800 square feet incredibly clean. This is a system I'm personally putting in throughout my house, replacing older, more expensive filters that didn't do as good a job.
[01:07:49.700 --> 01:08:12.700]  Find out why this system is so revolutionary today and then FullWarStore.com.
[01:08:19.700 --> 01:08:37.700]  That's a clutch bringing us in with 50,000 watts.
[01:08:37.700 --> 01:08:48.700]  That's a song about Fort Detrick, Maryland where they got 50,000 watt shortwave transmitters and anthrax bombs.
[01:08:48.700 --> 01:08:57.700]  Alright, anthrax and radio.
[01:08:57.700 --> 01:09:00.700]  James Leslie Rawls was scheduled, but he got stuck traveling.
[01:09:00.700 --> 01:09:05.700]  Boy, you know that happens with all this flooding and the rest of it, so he'll be on next week.
[01:09:05.700 --> 01:09:10.700]  We have a bunch of guests coming up in the next hour, but I was already talking about opening the phones up more today.
[01:09:10.700 --> 01:09:18.700]  And so we're going to do that in the shower on Hurricane Harvey, the new hurricane Irma that could be threatening the Gulf.
[01:09:18.700 --> 01:09:22.700]  Trump giving a million dollars and being criticized for it.
[01:09:22.700 --> 01:09:33.700]  Driverless cars as the House of Representatives moves to basically turn the roads over to the corporations and their robot sentries that will of course be above the law.
[01:09:33.700 --> 01:09:44.700]  And that ties into Google, big story up on newswars.com, newswars.com, a lot of exclusive important content there that it's up to you to get out, please.
[01:09:44.700 --> 01:09:48.700]  Insider, Google greatest threat to conservatism.
[01:09:48.700 --> 01:09:53.700]  And now it's coming out that they even manipulated Forbes to remove articles.
[01:09:53.700 --> 01:10:03.700]  Critical of Google and their monopolistic antitrust needed to be blocked behavior.
[01:10:03.700 --> 01:10:09.700]  So former think tank, program director and antitrust expert suggests that he was fired after criticizing Google,
[01:10:09.700 --> 01:10:15.700]  warning the rise of the monopolistic companies like Google are a threat to society,
[01:10:15.700 --> 01:10:22.700]  a fear validated after the company recently warned a conservative website to censor content or lose ad revenue.
[01:10:22.700 --> 01:10:26.700]  And just a few months ago, we got the internal documents that Google admitted were real.
[01:10:26.700 --> 01:10:35.700]  They were paying millions of dollars to have outside groups go and vote down our news and claim it's fake, hateful or racist.
[01:10:35.700 --> 01:10:41.700]  So they can say, oh, the community did it. We didn't do it. It's like hiring a hit man to go kill somebody.
[01:10:41.700 --> 01:10:50.700]  But you say, oh, but I didn't pull the trigger or I didn't wrap the tourniquet around their neck.
[01:10:50.700 --> 01:10:55.700]  No, I just sent somebody to do it.
[01:10:55.700 --> 01:11:01.700]  I never killed anybody. No, you never killed anybody in your life. You sent somebody else to do it, didn't you?
[01:11:01.700 --> 01:11:09.700]  And Google, Facebook, Twitter, they're all working in collusion, admittedly, to launch the censorship of nationalists,
[01:11:09.700 --> 01:11:18.700]  of patriots, of conservatives, of Christians, and they're teaming up with governments in the Middle East
[01:11:18.700 --> 01:11:25.700]  to report people that talk bad about their imam so they can be executed.
[01:11:25.700 --> 01:11:36.700]  That's right. That's in the news every day how Google, Facebook, Twitter, and others in Iran and in Pakistan
[01:11:36.700 --> 01:11:46.700]  and in Saudi Arabia every day it's in my stack where Google, Facebook, Twitter, they don't even need to get a complaint
[01:11:46.700 --> 01:11:53.700]  from the religious police in Saudi Arabia or Iran. They will report it to them and liaison with them.
[01:11:53.700 --> 01:12:02.700]  So, see, Google, Facebook, Twitter and the rest of them, they tailor the censorship to the countries and the parties in power.
[01:12:02.700 --> 01:12:08.700]  Just like Hillary was in thousands and thousands of WikiLeaks with Podesta and her other crew members
[01:12:08.700 --> 01:12:14.700]  managing the New York Times, the Washington Post, CNN, MSNBC, but more importantly Google
[01:12:14.700 --> 01:12:18.700]  in daily meetings and getting daily files from the Hillary campaigns.
[01:12:18.700 --> 01:12:25.700]  She even had interns running whole sections of the Internet blocking this, upvoting that.
[01:12:25.700 --> 01:12:35.700]  They've hired the former Stasi to help run Facebook Germany to then dispatch the police.
[01:12:35.700 --> 01:12:45.700]  Sweden, man's sentenced for eating bacon in front of Muslims. That's in the official major newspapers of Stockholm.
[01:12:45.700 --> 01:12:49.700]  It's always Stockholm where they say Muslims are allowed to rape, it's their culture.
[01:12:49.700 --> 01:12:57.700]  They're allowed to poop at the pool too. They also like to, for some reason, defecate up beside the toilet.
[01:12:57.700 --> 01:13:01.700]  They're telling, don't tell them not to, it's their culture.
[01:13:01.700 --> 01:13:05.700]  They also don't flush the paper, you don't do that in the third world. I guess if you do have an outhouse.
[01:13:05.700 --> 01:13:10.700]  So they pile it up. You see that other third world populations do it.
[01:13:10.700 --> 01:13:15.700]  But here, you know, they put signs on the toilet saying, no, tissue goes in the potty.
[01:13:15.700 --> 01:13:20.700]  You don't do that to a Muslim. They don't need tissue. They have their hands.
[01:13:20.700 --> 01:13:25.700]  They come out of the bathroom, out of the stall with their hand curled up because they got the poo poo in it.
[01:13:25.700 --> 01:13:31.700]  It's no big deal. And if they had diseases, they're not tested. That would be racist too.
[01:13:31.700 --> 01:13:37.700]  You just, you have black plague, you have cholera, you know, you have whatever, just come on in, baby.
[01:13:37.700 --> 01:13:42.700]  Doesn't matter if tourism is down 80% in France, it's what the government wants.
[01:13:42.700 --> 01:13:45.700]  And what the government wants, it gets because it wants to destroy things.
[01:13:45.700 --> 01:13:50.700]  It wants the Jacobin Revolution, the overthrow of reality.
[01:13:50.700 --> 01:13:58.700]  53 year old man from Stockholm, convicted of offensive behavior, being culturally insensitive.
[01:13:58.700 --> 01:14:03.700]  We're eating bacon in front of the Muslim women. Well, that's okay.
[01:14:03.700 --> 01:14:12.700]  The toll-free number to join us is 800-259-9231-800-2599-231.
[01:14:12.700 --> 01:14:17.700]  And she got Google and Facebook and Twitter and Apple and its slave factories on top of us.
[01:14:17.700 --> 01:14:24.700]  With the Democratic Party in Hollywood raining down their propaganda and bullying the American people.
[01:14:24.700 --> 01:14:29.700]  And below you've got not just the Antifa, not just the alt-left, but the real left.
[01:14:29.700 --> 01:14:36.700]  I challenge anyone to make a field trip down to a local Democrat event.
[01:14:36.700 --> 01:14:42.700]  And you'll hear Death to America. You'll hear, let's tell all the white people, even though it's mainly white people saying it.
[01:14:42.700 --> 01:14:48.700]  But don't worry, I've got a stack of news here about black serial killers in different parts of the country
[01:14:48.700 --> 01:14:53.700]  who go out and hunt white people at bus stops and hiking bike trails.
[01:14:53.700 --> 01:14:57.700]  Oh yeah, there's no hunting of the elite that actually engineered all this.
[01:14:57.700 --> 01:15:04.700]  No, no, it's always some other poor person with their bag of groceries at the bus stop shot in the back of the head
[01:15:04.700 --> 01:15:09.700]  or people on the hiking bike trails shot and hunted.
[01:15:09.700 --> 01:15:16.700]  And then in the cases it's being praised on social media, folks are saying, yeah, kill the white devils.
[01:15:16.700 --> 01:15:20.700]  But what's funny is there's no mainstream news coverage of any of these reports.
[01:15:20.700 --> 01:15:25.700]  We have someone in FullWars.com, a Don Salazar wrote about a big case of a guy that reportedly killed a bunch of people.
[01:15:25.700 --> 01:15:30.700]  And he said online, I'm going around and hunting white people, I'm killing them.
[01:15:30.700 --> 01:15:33.700]  And I guess finally, you know, the police investigated it.
[01:15:33.700 --> 01:15:40.700]  It was mere white people getting killed. And sure enough, they got their man being reported.
[01:15:40.700 --> 01:15:44.700]  But that's okay because the SPLC is going to save us.
[01:15:44.700 --> 01:15:53.700]  Since I mentioned it, we can pull that article up if you'd like to see it in amongst the articles about being arrested for eating bacon.
[01:15:53.700 --> 01:16:00.700]  Only in California, Sacramento to pay gang members a cash stipend.
[01:16:00.700 --> 01:16:03.700]  That's a monthly payment if they stop killing people.
[01:16:03.700 --> 01:16:07.700]  Because it works so well in Afghanistan to pay the group stop killing each other.
[01:16:07.700 --> 01:16:09.700]  That's not a joke.
[01:16:09.700 --> 01:16:15.700]  Black man who wanted to kill all the white people, close quote, accused of killing white people in a killing spree.
[01:16:15.700 --> 01:16:20.700]  Frederick Deemond.
[01:16:20.700 --> 01:16:22.700]  You got to love that middle name, Deemond.
[01:16:22.700 --> 01:16:31.700]  Frederick Deemond Scott, 22. Well, you got to give his parents credit for coming up with an original name.
[01:16:31.700 --> 01:16:34.700]  I like Deemond. Well, it's actually Deemond.
[01:16:34.700 --> 01:16:37.700]  But okay, Frederick Deemond Scott.
[01:16:37.700 --> 01:16:40.700]  I'll just put a French little twist on it. It sounds kind of cool.
[01:16:40.700 --> 01:16:46.700]  Frederick Deemond Scott, 22, suspected of several bike trail murders in South Kansas City.
[01:16:46.700 --> 01:16:49.700]  And now they think a whole bunch more.
[01:16:49.700 --> 01:16:56.700]  Well, I mean, Michael Moore does say we need to get rid of all the white people, be better off without the white people.
[01:16:56.700 --> 01:16:59.700]  Well, Glenn Beck was led by the establishment into oblivion.
[01:16:59.700 --> 01:17:01.700]  I'm not happy about this.
[01:17:01.700 --> 01:17:07.700]  Glenn Beck's media empire implodes with layoffs ex-employee calls him professionally bipolar.
[01:17:07.700 --> 01:17:14.700]  Well, I don't ever listen to what ex-employees say because that's famously, you know, it's easier to listen to ex-husbands or ex-wives and believe that.
[01:17:14.700 --> 01:17:19.700]  That's the type of fairy tale people classically get. But I know what Glenn Beck did to me.
[01:17:19.700 --> 01:17:23.700]  He tried to get radio stations that were carrying my show to not carry me.
[01:17:23.700 --> 01:17:32.700]  Had folks go out for my sponsors and behind the scenes, he did all sorts of terrible things while he tried to steal our research and then spin it and twist it.
[01:17:32.700 --> 01:17:41.700]  But when he got too much trouble doing that, he then became the new Benedict Arnold's Judas Iscariot that goes in me a copus to the media and says, I'm a conservative.
[01:17:41.700 --> 01:17:47.700]  They're all really bad people and you liberals are really right. They kind of pat him on the head and rub him on the belly.
[01:17:47.700 --> 01:17:57.700]  I described it back during the election as him as like a little goblin, a little snake in on his little belly before Hillary and everybody, you know, hoping for subscripts.
[01:17:57.700 --> 01:18:06.700]  And what he did was destroy his entire operation that was the biggest independent media organization in the United States.
[01:18:06.700 --> 01:18:14.700]  The most successful multimedia platform. And I would have been glad if he was a patriot to have him.
[01:18:14.700 --> 01:18:18.700]  And we are obviously a lot bigger than Glenn Beck now, but it's not about who's biggest.
[01:18:18.700 --> 01:18:23.700]  Matt Drudge, when total reach of people and able to change the narrative is number one.
[01:18:23.700 --> 01:18:26.700]  I sleep good at night knowing there's folks more successful than I am.
[01:18:26.700 --> 01:18:31.700]  And I'm looking for other people to become more successful than I am because I don't have a death wish.
[01:18:31.700 --> 01:18:36.700]  I don't like being numero uno enemy of the globalist. I want to beat them.
[01:18:36.700 --> 01:18:42.700]  And I don't want to storm the metaphysical castle of Count Dracool alone.
[01:18:42.700 --> 01:18:50.700]  I'd like to have a large contingent from the surrounding villages with torches in their hands of all shapes, sizes and skin colors.
[01:18:50.700 --> 01:19:00.700]  And together we can culturally storm the castle, dig him out of his nest and drive a big old fat juicy steak through his heart.
[01:19:00.700 --> 01:19:11.700]  But that takes focus and that takes not being competitive when it comes to intellectual matters, not being territorial, but loving it.
[01:19:11.700 --> 01:19:18.700]  When my talking points become the talking points of the land and then the talking points of the world.
[01:19:18.700 --> 01:19:26.700]  That's victory, not private jets and wearing different little fancy sweaters every day and taking yourself real serious.
[01:19:26.700 --> 01:19:31.700]  And inviting directors and people in so you can candy ass around.
[01:19:31.700 --> 01:19:34.700]  And I'm not against Lindbeck that people say he acts like Liberace.
[01:19:34.700 --> 01:19:40.700]  I mean, nothing against Liberace in his behavior. I think, you know, candy assing about is kind of cute, actually.
[01:19:40.700 --> 01:19:51.700]  But, I mean, Lindbeck is a six foot three prancing fairy who is a complete fob and an absolute complete sycophant with power structure.
[01:19:51.700 --> 01:19:54.700]  And it's good to see him crash and burn.
[01:19:54.700 --> 01:19:58.700]  Hunters, anglers, campers and survivalists, get back to nature.

[01:21:01.700 --> 01:21:03.700]  but the symptoms are there.
[01:21:03.700 --> 01:21:08.700]  Loss of energy, blood sugar, spikes and drops, poor circulation and irregular heartbeat

[01:21:17.700 --> 01:21:21.700]  My blood pressure has normalized, my diabetes has totally improved.

[01:22:56.700 --> 01:23:03.700]  Our president has stated we are sitting on a bubble right now and that when the Fed raises interest rates, bad things are going to happen.
[01:23:03.700 --> 01:23:06.700]  Well, the Fed is raising rates here and now.

[01:24:07.700 --> 01:24:10.700]  And there's new Mueller fake investigation news.
[01:24:10.700 --> 01:24:15.700]  But first off, I'm told all over the internet, make frog straight again is like best selling apparel.
[01:24:15.700 --> 01:24:18.700]  Folks have sent me this make frog straight again hat.
[01:24:18.700 --> 01:24:22.700]  I don't mean this to be homophobic, it's more than just a joke.
[01:24:22.700 --> 01:24:23.700]  But let's get serious.
[01:24:23.700 --> 01:24:31.700]  Mike Sernovich put out a really funny piece when Hillary claimed that Trump was breathing down his neck down Mr. Clinton's neck.
[01:24:31.700 --> 01:24:37.700]  And so Pepe the Frog showed up, so I'll narrate this for radio listeners. Here it is.
[01:24:37.700 --> 01:24:40.700]  This is not okay, I thought.
[01:24:40.700 --> 01:24:45.700]  It was the second presidential debate and he was looming behind me.
[01:24:45.700 --> 01:24:50.700]  Two days before the world heard him writing about groping women.
[01:24:50.700 --> 01:24:59.700]  Now we were on a small stage and no matter where I walked, he followed me closely, staring at me, making faces.
[01:24:59.700 --> 01:25:02.700]  It was incredibly uncomfortable.
[01:25:02.700 --> 01:25:05.700]  He was literally breathing down my neck.
[01:25:05.700 --> 01:25:07.700]  My skin crawled.
[01:25:07.700 --> 01:25:13.700]  It was one of those moments where you wish you could hit pause and ask everyone watching.
[01:25:13.700 --> 01:25:16.700]  Well, what would you do?
[01:25:16.700 --> 01:25:22.700]  It kept my cool, aided by a lifetime of dealing with difficult men trying to throw me off.
[01:25:22.700 --> 01:25:30.700]  I did, however, grip the microphone extra hard.
[01:25:30.700 --> 01:25:32.700]  Absolutely hilarious.
[01:25:32.700 --> 01:25:34.700]  Love the stuff Mike and his team come up with.
[01:25:34.700 --> 01:25:36.700]  He'll be hosting the fourth hour by the way today.
[01:25:36.700 --> 01:25:41.700]  Let's go ahead and go to this placebong piece, which again is some really weird art.
[01:25:41.700 --> 01:25:42.700]  The guy's really successful.
[01:25:42.700 --> 01:25:44.700]  He takes a lot of clips from the show.
[01:25:44.700 --> 01:25:46.700]  And this one, the crew likes it.
[01:25:46.700 --> 01:25:51.700]  I think it's a little over the top, but since Glenn Beck is imploding, this is a little hat tip to him.
[01:25:51.700 --> 01:25:57.700]  Listen to the radio host, Alex Jones.
[01:25:57.700 --> 01:26:03.700]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:26:03.700 --> 01:26:05.700]  Beck, boom, everywhere.
[01:26:05.700 --> 01:26:08.700]  Glenn Beck, mark that spot.
[01:26:08.700 --> 01:26:09.700]  The plague lies there.
[01:26:09.700 --> 01:26:12.700]  The enemy is nothing worse.
[01:26:12.700 --> 01:26:18.700]  Little minion, this little gremlin.
[01:26:18.700 --> 01:26:20.700]  Beck's not even a goblin.
[01:26:20.700 --> 01:26:21.700]  He's a gremlin.
[01:26:21.700 --> 01:26:22.700]  Glenn Beck.
[01:26:22.700 --> 01:26:23.700]  Glenn Beck.
[01:26:23.700 --> 01:26:26.700]  And he sits there like he's always on a toilet.
[01:26:26.700 --> 01:26:28.700]  He's in this little face like he's constipated.
[01:26:28.700 --> 01:26:30.700]  Glenn Beck sits there on his chair.
[01:26:30.700 --> 01:26:32.700]  He comes on him.
[01:26:32.700 --> 01:26:35.700]  He's like the worst spot was because he's constipated on the screenshot.
[01:26:35.700 --> 01:26:37.700]  Like back at the beginning of the video.
[01:26:37.700 --> 01:26:39.700]  It's so funny how he actually constipated.
[01:26:39.700 --> 01:26:40.700]  Here, I'm supposed to show you.
[01:26:40.700 --> 01:26:49.700]  Here we go.
[01:26:49.700 --> 01:26:50.700]  This is what they came up with.
[01:26:50.700 --> 01:26:57.700]  Let's hear the creature that they dug up out of atheist, God-hating abortion radio.
[01:26:57.700 --> 01:26:59.700]  And let's hear what he has to say.
[01:26:59.700 --> 01:27:04.700]  What is frightening to me is the lack of reaction from the crowd.
[01:27:04.700 --> 01:27:07.700]  What's frightening to me, it's all calculated.
[01:27:07.700 --> 01:27:11.700]  He scripts with actors and hops around big candy asses on my back.
[01:27:11.700 --> 01:27:12.700]  I'm so scared.
[01:27:12.700 --> 01:27:14.700]  He's like, so everybody's supposed to be scared now.
[01:27:14.700 --> 01:27:15.700]  So done.
[01:27:15.700 --> 01:27:16.700]  Here it is.
[01:27:16.700 --> 01:27:17.700]  What is frightening to me is-
[01:27:17.700 --> 01:27:19.700]  Everyone hates you, but the dumbest people.
[01:27:19.700 --> 01:27:20.700]  Look how pathetic he feels.
[01:27:20.700 --> 01:27:23.700]  Like, ooh, we have the moral high ground.
[01:27:23.700 --> 01:27:24.700]  Here it is.
[01:27:24.700 --> 01:27:26.700]  What is frightening to me is-
[01:27:26.700 --> 01:27:28.700]  I'm sorry, back at the beginning.
[01:27:28.700 --> 01:27:30.700]  I want to see that constipated look again.
[01:27:30.700 --> 01:27:31.700]  What is frightening to me is-
[01:27:31.700 --> 01:27:33.700]  This is too sweet, see.
[01:27:33.700 --> 01:27:35.700]  He is such an arrogant piece of garbage.
[01:27:35.700 --> 01:27:36.700]  Let's finish the clip.
[01:27:36.700 --> 01:27:37.700]  What is frightening to me-
[01:27:37.700 --> 01:27:39.700]  You're a bad person.
[01:27:39.700 --> 01:27:41.700]  You're a bad person.
[01:27:41.700 --> 01:27:43.700]  You're a bad, bad person.
[01:27:43.700 --> 01:27:44.700]  You're a bad person.
[01:27:44.700 --> 01:27:47.700]  You're a trash, my dear.
[01:27:51.700 --> 01:27:53.700]  This is a really ridiculous part
[01:27:53.700 --> 01:27:56.700]  where I was doing the A-OK symbol
[01:27:56.700 --> 01:27:59.700]  and asking why I was supposedly so evil.
[01:27:59.700 --> 01:28:01.700]  I don't remember even doing this.
[01:28:01.700 --> 01:28:05.700]  This is so ridiculous.
[01:28:05.700 --> 01:28:08.700]  I am so unintentionally ridiculous.
[01:28:08.700 --> 01:28:10.700]  It's true, I'm a walking train wreck.
[01:28:10.700 --> 01:28:13.700]  In a good way.
[01:28:13.700 --> 01:28:16.700]  But it's good that I like to be made fun of, see.
[01:28:16.700 --> 01:28:18.700]  I wouldn't have any magic.
[01:28:18.700 --> 01:28:20.700]  I'm a pioneer.
[01:28:20.700 --> 01:28:23.700]  I'm an explorer.
[01:28:23.700 --> 01:28:26.700]  I'm a human.
[01:28:26.700 --> 01:28:29.700]  And I'm coming.
[01:28:29.700 --> 01:28:30.700]  I'm an enemy.
[01:28:30.700 --> 01:28:31.700]  I'm alive.
[01:28:31.700 --> 01:28:32.700]  I'm big.
[01:28:32.700 --> 01:28:35.700]  It's got hot blood going through.
[01:28:35.700 --> 01:28:38.700]  I'm here.
[01:28:38.700 --> 01:28:39.700]  I'm here.
[01:28:39.700 --> 01:28:40.700]  This is a human.
[01:28:40.700 --> 01:28:41.700]  This is what we look like.
[01:28:41.700 --> 01:28:43.700]  This is what we act like.
[01:28:43.700 --> 01:28:45.700]  This is what I am.
[01:28:45.700 --> 01:28:47.700]  This is what I am.
[01:28:47.700 --> 01:28:49.700]  This is what I am.
[01:28:49.700 --> 01:28:50.700]  This is what I am.
[01:28:50.700 --> 01:28:52.700]  I'm setting fires everywhere.
[01:28:52.700 --> 01:28:55.700]  And humans are turning on everywhere.
[01:28:55.700 --> 01:28:57.700]  And we're going to get our metaphysical hands around.
[01:28:57.700 --> 01:28:58.700]  You're stinking next.
[01:28:58.700 --> 01:29:00.700]  Make no mistake, parasites.
[01:29:00.700 --> 01:29:03.700]  John, we're going to break here.
[01:29:03.700 --> 01:29:12.700]  When were you arrested?
[01:29:12.700 --> 01:29:13.700]  Come again.
[01:29:13.700 --> 01:29:14.700]  Holy hell.
[01:29:14.700 --> 01:29:37.700]  By the way, they're trying to block Sheriff Rapayo's pardon now.
[01:29:37.700 --> 01:29:41.700]  These rogue government agents will get into rogue government with Mueller.
[01:29:41.700 --> 01:29:44.700]  He really is the symbol of that, your phone call straight ahead.
[01:29:44.700 --> 01:29:45.700]  We're on the march.
[01:29:45.700 --> 01:29:48.700]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:29:48.700 --> 01:30:00.700]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:00.700 --> 01:30:07.700]  We've got great air filters, great water filters, great non-GMO heirloom seeds, great books, great films, great patriot apparel to meet like-minded people.
[01:30:07.700 --> 01:30:13.700]  And we've got a new humongoid sale, not the number of things that are on massive sale, but on what's on sale.
[01:30:13.700 --> 01:30:15.700]  Out for months, not been on sale for months and months.
[01:30:15.700 --> 01:30:23.700]  We've never offered super male vitality, no concentrated herbs, cold pressed, super male vitality, 57% off.
[01:30:23.700 --> 01:30:25.700]  It's never been the price.
[01:30:25.700 --> 01:30:31.700]  It is right now with 3,596 reviews, 4.6 reviews total by third party sites, unprecedented.
[01:30:31.700 --> 01:30:32.700]  And it's cold pressed.
[01:30:32.700 --> 01:30:34.700]  That's why super male is so different.
[01:30:34.700 --> 01:30:38.700]  People say, well, I know these compounds work because it's admitted to science and these are what you sell.
[01:30:38.700 --> 01:30:40.700]  Buzzfeed said it's like, it's already best selling stuff.
[01:30:40.700 --> 01:30:42.700]  It's been certified as healthy and good forever.
[01:30:42.700 --> 01:30:44.700]  Why these aren't anything new?
[01:30:44.700 --> 01:30:48.700]  Because why do something new when you can have the oldest and best but cold pressed?
[01:30:48.700 --> 01:30:49.700]  Boo.
[01:30:49.700 --> 01:30:50.700]  Boo.

[01:32:30.700 --> 01:32:38.700]  Just some of the ingredients in Super Blue chosen by our dental experts include xylitol, peppermint oil, iodine, nano silver, and more.
[01:32:38.700 --> 01:32:42.700]  Due to requests from listeners who found that spearmint was a little bit too strong for some of their children,
[01:32:42.700 --> 01:32:46.700]  we have created the new Bubble Gum flavored Super Blue that is spearmint free.
[01:32:46.700 --> 01:32:55.700]  Learn more about the new Bubble Gum flavored Super Blue toothpaste and more at infowarslife.com and support the info war while you support healthy gums and teeth.
[01:32:55.700 --> 01:33:19.700]  Rating a frontal assault on the lives of the new world order, it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:33:25.700 --> 01:33:45.780]  Now we're going to be taking your phone calls throughout the rest of the hour while a great
[01:33:45.780 --> 01:33:48.780]  person rides shotgun with us, Austin Fletcher.
[01:33:48.780 --> 01:33:56.940]  I've been seeing his videos the last year, so YouTube, it's Fleckis Talks, F-L-E-C-C-A-S
[01:33:56.940 --> 01:34:01.340]  Talks, and he's a 28-year-old Dartmouth educated journalist.
[01:34:01.340 --> 01:34:06.620]  He lives in L.A., where he's exposed leftist insanity on his YouTube channel, Fleckis Talks,
[01:34:06.620 --> 01:34:08.260]  which has millions of views.
[01:34:08.260 --> 01:34:10.620]  He's become a voice of the new young conservatives.
[01:34:10.620 --> 01:34:14.740]  He covers all the major protests and shows just how little the left really knows in a
[01:34:14.740 --> 01:34:15.900]  comedic way.
[01:34:15.900 --> 01:34:18.140]  He's a patriot fighting the left and the culture front.
[01:34:18.140 --> 01:34:22.860]  We're going to play a clip here in just a moment, but you've got to understand something.
[01:34:22.860 --> 01:34:27.500]  We can make a joke out of this, and it's okay to laugh, but it's dangerous at the same time.
[01:34:27.500 --> 01:34:30.740]  It's like whistling past the graveyard, and I'm not criticizing him for laughing.
[01:34:30.740 --> 01:34:37.780]  I laugh more than he does, but I understand these folks see us as the existential enemy.
[01:34:37.780 --> 01:34:42.620]  So there's a bunch of clips we've got, so we'll just randomly go to one of them.
[01:34:42.620 --> 01:34:47.820]  But there was this particular clip where this guy's wrapped an American flag, talking trash
[01:34:47.820 --> 01:34:52.780]  about Trump, saying he's a horrible person, and then our guest says, yeah, but what about
[01:34:52.780 --> 01:34:53.780]  the Russian narrative?
[01:34:53.780 --> 01:34:55.020]  They've kind of dropped that for now.
[01:34:55.020 --> 01:34:58.340]  He goes, well, yeah, that's because we're on the racism thing right now.
[01:34:58.340 --> 01:35:03.260]  Even the protesters that are able to form a sentence understand these are just talking
[01:35:03.260 --> 01:35:09.060]  points that they watch on MSNBC or CNN and then go repeat.
[01:35:09.060 --> 01:35:14.300]  How is that personally empowering you to be a total minion when the WikiLeaks with CNN
[01:35:14.300 --> 01:35:20.580]  and MSNBC call you idiots, call you basement dwellers, call you baristas living with mommy?
[01:35:20.580 --> 01:35:23.860]  I know some baristas that make $100,000 a year.
[01:35:23.860 --> 01:35:25.780]  That's actually a pretty good job in the right town.
[01:35:25.780 --> 01:35:33.580]  The point is they see their constituents as idiots, as disenfranchised morons begging,
[01:35:33.580 --> 01:35:36.900]  wanting something, and Hillary's calling you an idiot, saying you're not going to get anything
[01:35:36.900 --> 01:35:40.380]  free, you schmucks.
[01:35:40.380 --> 01:35:42.180]  Look at Obamacare.
[01:35:42.180 --> 01:35:43.820]  We already had free healthcare for poor people.
[01:35:43.820 --> 01:35:47.580]  They're getting rid of charity care now and forcing you to pay for it and forcing you
[01:35:47.580 --> 01:35:51.260]  to buy it and ripping everybody off, and the insurance companies wrote it to rip you off,
[01:35:51.260 --> 01:35:52.980]  but I'm digressing.
[01:35:52.980 --> 01:35:56.460]  Let's play one of the clips of our reporter.
[01:35:56.460 --> 01:36:02.100]  It's 2017 and we're having to protest against the Nazis.
[01:36:02.100 --> 01:36:06.500]  I'm here standing up against racism and the Nazis.
[01:36:06.500 --> 01:36:13.020]  I thought we got rid of them over, like, 70 years ago, but they're coming back.
[01:36:13.020 --> 01:36:15.500]  What's the way to defeat the Nazis in the U.S.?
[01:36:15.500 --> 01:36:16.500]  Violence.
[01:36:16.500 --> 01:36:22.100]  Trotsky said it best, find your Nazis, eat them, take them of their Nazi paraphernalia,
[01:36:22.100 --> 01:36:24.780]  and then leave them alive, hurting and bleeding in their cowardice.
[01:36:24.780 --> 01:36:27.700]  Same way we dealt with them in World War II.
[01:36:27.700 --> 01:36:28.700]  Kill them.
[01:36:28.700 --> 01:36:29.700]  There's no other way.
[01:36:29.700 --> 01:36:30.700]  That's right.
[01:36:30.700 --> 01:36:32.700]  No fashion talk up here.
[01:36:32.700 --> 01:36:37.620]  Captain America punches Nazis, Indiana Jones punches Nazis, my grandfather went and killed
[01:36:37.620 --> 01:36:39.860]  Nazis in Normandy and he was a f***ing hero.
[01:36:39.860 --> 01:36:49.660]  We have yet to have a perfect communist state.
[01:36:49.660 --> 01:36:50.660]  It hasn't happened yet.
[01:36:50.660 --> 01:36:52.180]  That doesn't mean we shouldn't push for it.
[01:36:52.180 --> 01:36:54.180]  Have you watched Star Trek?
[01:36:54.180 --> 01:36:55.180]  Star Trek is a communist utopia.
[01:36:55.180 --> 01:36:57.420]  That's what happens when communism wins.
[01:36:57.420 --> 01:37:01.940]  Listen, everyone said, oh yeah, you can't listen to CNN no more.
[01:37:01.940 --> 01:37:05.940]  You can't listen to the news anymore because it's all fake, bullcrap.
[01:37:05.940 --> 01:37:08.900]  It wasn't fake before, so why is it fake now?
[01:37:08.900 --> 01:37:15.140]  The Russian story has kind of died down in those days, only because we're on the racism
[01:37:15.140 --> 01:37:16.140]  thing now.
[01:37:16.140 --> 01:37:17.140]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:37:17.140 --> 01:37:19.860]  Austin Fletcher, amazing work.
[01:37:19.860 --> 01:37:20.860]  Everybody should follow him.
[01:37:20.860 --> 01:37:25.180]  They're on his YouTube channel and follow us at realalexions on Twitter as well.
[01:37:25.180 --> 01:37:29.060]  And of course, David Nice launches new transmission weekday at 8 a.m. central.
[01:37:29.060 --> 01:37:32.860]  A lot of affiliates starting to pick that up or looking to carry that syndicated radio
[01:37:32.860 --> 01:37:36.020]  slash TV transmission and never forget that viewers.
[01:37:36.020 --> 01:37:38.180]  We're also a syndicated radio show.
[01:37:38.180 --> 01:37:39.260]  That's what the format is.
[01:37:39.260 --> 01:37:40.260]  It's what the clock is.
[01:37:40.260 --> 01:37:43.740]  It's what the ads are geared for, but also television.
[01:37:43.740 --> 01:37:48.860]  We have quite a few cable and TV stations now picking up large portions of the transmission.
[01:37:48.860 --> 01:37:50.860]  So very, very thankful for all those affiliates.
[01:37:50.860 --> 01:37:54.940]  So however you're watching us now, be sure and thank those local TV stations, cable
[01:37:54.940 --> 01:37:59.260]  systems, and be sure and thank those local radio stations as well.
[01:37:59.260 --> 01:38:02.500]  So Austin, wow, here at the office, we're big fans.
[01:38:02.500 --> 01:38:06.940]  In fact, I wanted to reach out to you and talk to you about you being a reporter for
[01:38:06.940 --> 01:38:11.900]  us, but simultaneously keeping your own platform because you're a go-getter, you're out there
[01:38:11.900 --> 01:38:19.140]  in the middle of it, and you just catch the most amazing footage from these people where
[01:38:19.140 --> 01:38:22.940]  they don't understand, communists killed 200 million people, the Nazis killed 30 million,
[01:38:22.940 --> 01:38:23.940]  which are terrible.
[01:38:23.940 --> 01:38:26.660]  The Nazis, both my grandfathers, almost died in World War II.
[01:38:26.660 --> 01:38:29.940]  That guy looked a little young for his grandpa to be in World War II.
[01:38:29.940 --> 01:38:34.260]  I mean, it's pretty much the cutoff if you're like, you know, 40 years old or so, but you're
[01:38:34.260 --> 01:38:39.460]  sitting here looking at this, and they're just so violent and so empowered that they
[01:38:39.460 --> 01:38:42.700]  now can call anybody they want a Nazi.
[01:38:42.700 --> 01:38:46.660]  Now we see Antifa being listed as a terror group.
[01:38:46.660 --> 01:38:50.780]  The Democrats are turning on them, but from my experience, the Democrats in general, not
[01:38:50.780 --> 01:38:55.700]  just classic Antifa, who are really communists, they call themselves anti-fascists.
[01:38:55.700 --> 01:38:58.700]  This is pretty much the general behavior of them overall.
[01:38:58.700 --> 01:39:06.260]  Do you think that's true from California, where you're covering this every week, or
[01:39:06.260 --> 01:39:07.260]  are they getting more radical?
[01:39:07.260 --> 01:39:08.540]  Are they getting less radical?
[01:39:08.540 --> 01:39:09.540]  What's really happening?
[01:39:09.540 --> 01:39:11.860]  I think they're getting more radical.
[01:39:11.860 --> 01:39:16.500]  Realistically, they're buying right into the cheap story, the mainstream media selling.
[01:39:16.500 --> 01:39:18.380]  They think they're actually fighting Nazis.
[01:39:18.380 --> 01:39:21.700]  And if there were Nazis in the U.S., like, don't get us wrong, the right would be the
[01:39:21.700 --> 01:39:24.540]  first people probably to jump in and protect American people.
[01:39:24.540 --> 01:39:27.060]  But these people think there's Nazis here.
[01:39:27.060 --> 01:39:28.860]  The right thing to do is fight the Nazis.
[01:39:28.860 --> 01:39:30.380]  We're justified to use violence.
[01:39:30.380 --> 01:39:32.500]  We have to get out there and protect the people.
[01:39:32.500 --> 01:39:36.340]  When realistically, they haven't been patriotic a day in their life, this is, they just want
[01:39:36.340 --> 01:39:39.620]  something that's bigger than themselves to buy into and be a part of.
[01:39:39.620 --> 01:39:44.620]  And unfortunately, they believe the mainstream media when they say we have a Nazi problem.
[01:39:44.620 --> 01:39:49.340]  I think it's like stolen glory, this phenomenon of people dressing up in military uniforms
[01:39:49.340 --> 01:39:53.380]  and going out to community events to get money, you know, to get jobs.
[01:39:53.380 --> 01:39:57.100]  You name it, claiming, you know, they've got silver stars or bronze stars or we're green
[01:39:57.100 --> 01:40:00.220]  berets and we're never even in the National Guard of the Army.
[01:40:00.220 --> 01:40:05.180]  We see that and when you hear them, they're like Captain America beat up Nazis, Brad Pitt
[01:40:05.180 --> 01:40:10.660]  beat up Nazis in, you know, the different Quentin Tarantino movies.
[01:40:10.660 --> 01:40:15.500]  So I think that's what we're dealing with here is the fantasy that they're like Captain
[01:40:15.500 --> 01:40:19.340]  America and this is a form of fantasy role play.
[01:40:19.340 --> 01:40:20.840]  Oh, absolutely.
[01:40:20.840 --> 01:40:23.580]  And fantasy role play is right up their alley.
[01:40:23.580 --> 01:40:26.700]  These people, they don't really take, you know, they don't have religion in their life.
[01:40:26.700 --> 01:40:29.500]  They don't have anything that's bigger than themselves that they can work towards and
[01:40:29.500 --> 01:40:30.700]  be a part of.
[01:40:30.700 --> 01:40:35.660]  So they, I mean, they think they're fighting Nazis and that would be great, but it's not
[01:40:35.660 --> 01:40:36.660]  what's going on.
[01:40:36.660 --> 01:40:40.700]  And now we have these people who think it's okay to use violence and every protest, we
[01:40:40.700 --> 01:40:45.780]  saw it in Berkeley last week, every situation where anyone from the conservative side comes
[01:40:45.780 --> 01:40:49.180]  out to do something publicly, they think they have a right to shut it down with violence
[01:40:49.180 --> 01:40:51.860]  now when realistically, obviously they're being the fastest.
[01:40:51.860 --> 01:40:53.340]  They're the ones who are acting like Nazis.
[01:40:53.340 --> 01:40:56.700]  They're the ones who are, you know, really pushing this communist agenda that has no
[01:40:56.700 --> 01:40:57.700]  place in America.
[01:40:57.700 --> 01:41:03.500]  By the way, Austin, what we're giving people is serious anthropology, sociology, cultural
[01:41:03.500 --> 01:41:04.500]  analysis.
[01:41:04.500 --> 01:41:05.500]  It's dead on.
[01:41:05.500 --> 01:41:08.780]  What I've been saying for a year, they think they're Captain America fighting Red Skull
[01:41:08.780 --> 01:41:14.260]  and now in countless internet postings and videos, we shoot videos, you shoot, they say,
[01:41:14.260 --> 01:41:19.020]  we're inglorious bastards, we're Captain America, we're destroying Hydra, then they go beat
[01:41:19.020 --> 01:41:28.620]  up libertarian tranny, a transsexual, a Japanese guy and a bunch of black guys all over California
[01:41:28.620 --> 01:41:32.980]  just at peaceful free speech rallies, but it's okay because they say you're a Nazi.
[01:41:32.980 --> 01:41:36.820]  And so it's like role play, they then come and hit you in the head with a bike lock.
[01:41:36.820 --> 01:41:43.420]  They've even had major comics come out and say, I work for Red Skull.
[01:41:43.420 --> 01:41:44.420]  It's insane.
[01:41:44.420 --> 01:41:49.020]  And yeah, exactly like you said, they, they're, they're certain they're completely positive.
[01:41:49.020 --> 01:41:54.140]  And that's the problem because I think on the upside, they are going to turn on themselves.
[01:41:54.140 --> 01:41:56.020]  They've already kind of turned on black lives matter.
[01:41:56.020 --> 01:41:58.260]  They've already gotten scuffles where they're fighting themselves.
[01:41:58.260 --> 01:42:01.820]  I think with the recent disavowing from the left, which is obviously a good thing from
[01:42:01.820 --> 01:42:06.260]  Pelosi and those people, I think the next step is they become a kind of rogue group
[01:42:06.260 --> 01:42:08.500]  that no one wants to mess with at all.
[01:42:08.500 --> 01:42:09.500]  So what happened?
[01:42:09.500 --> 01:42:14.460]  Because CNN and the rest of them tried to sell it in the last six months as the Vanguard,
[01:42:14.460 --> 01:42:17.820]  the Soros group that would fight the racists, that would fight the evil cops that would
[01:42:17.820 --> 01:42:18.820]  do all this.
[01:42:18.820 --> 01:42:24.020]  What in reality, if there was 500 Nazis punching people downtown, I would go down there if
[01:42:24.020 --> 01:42:25.340]  the cops didn't do something to fight them.
[01:42:25.340 --> 01:42:28.580]  I mean, I'm not bragging, but I did that at the inauguration when the left wouldn't let
[01:42:28.580 --> 01:42:29.580]  people in.
[01:42:29.580 --> 01:42:33.900]  I mean, we physically ran over them, punched them, knocked them over because I'm not going
[01:42:33.900 --> 01:42:34.900]  to put up with it.
[01:42:34.900 --> 01:42:37.300]  I mean, I went and screamed at cops in their face and said, do something.
[01:42:37.300 --> 01:42:39.300]  They wouldn't do anything because they were controlled.
[01:42:39.300 --> 01:42:40.540]  And that's another issue.
[01:42:40.540 --> 01:42:46.220]  These are Democrat-controlled cities and Democrat-controlled universities where these carrion crows run
[01:42:46.220 --> 01:42:48.100]  around beating up people.
[01:42:48.100 --> 01:42:53.060]  Yeah, that's a major issue, the Democrat-controlled cities, because they're saying stand down
[01:42:53.060 --> 01:42:55.780]  to the police and they're letting the violence happen.
[01:42:55.780 --> 01:42:57.340]  And it's not, it's only a matter of time.
[01:42:57.340 --> 01:42:59.540]  People's going to get killed in the next few weeks, especially.
[01:42:59.540 --> 01:43:01.620]  It's only going to get worse and worse.
[01:43:01.620 --> 01:43:04.300]  The left can disavow them all they want now, but it's almost too late.
[01:43:04.300 --> 01:43:05.980]  They've already kind of established their base.
[01:43:05.980 --> 01:43:09.420]  They've already established their power within their local communities.
[01:43:09.420 --> 01:43:14.020]  And now, I mean, I don't want to give too much credit to them, but they are the most
[01:43:14.020 --> 01:43:17.660]  like, you know, violent group out there that, you know, is to be reckoned with.
[01:43:17.660 --> 01:43:19.180]  So we have to kind of figure out a way.
[01:43:19.180 --> 01:43:21.580]  That's why I saw what they were doing, Antifa.
[01:43:21.580 --> 01:43:25.980]  I saw the role that they were trying to play and the narrative the media gave them.
[01:43:25.980 --> 01:43:29.740]  And I, you know, as a patriot, I had to take it to the streets myself, and I didn't get
[01:43:29.740 --> 01:43:30.740]  violent with them.
[01:43:30.740 --> 01:43:34.900]  I tried to break up the fights, but I knew if I can get a video of them and just show
[01:43:34.900 --> 01:43:40.420]  how little they know, expose them, expose their, you know, tainted beliefs and discredit
[01:43:40.420 --> 01:43:45.060]  their whole movement, maybe both sides can come together and agree that these aren't people
[01:43:45.060 --> 01:43:46.060]  we should get behind.
[01:43:46.060 --> 01:43:47.060]  Well, exactly.
[01:43:47.060 --> 01:43:50.380]  I mean, you don't see big nationwide movements of real white supremacists.
[01:43:50.380 --> 01:43:57.300]  That's a very, very rare federally run, ne'er-do-well type deal, but with the Antifa and the left
[01:43:57.300 --> 01:44:01.700]  being just mean in general, we go out to events all the time, all over the country, that no
[01:44:01.700 --> 01:44:05.740]  one, I mean, maybe one out of a thousand will talk to us cogently.
[01:44:05.740 --> 01:44:10.460]  They just scream and hate and just stereotypically spout things.
[01:44:10.460 --> 01:44:14.500]  I'm saying this is a big victory, obviously, that Trump said both sides are bad, but this
[01:44:14.500 --> 01:44:18.620]  group came starting it and that's always worse, whoever initiates the violence under common
[01:44:18.620 --> 01:44:20.180]  sense and their common law.
[01:44:20.180 --> 01:44:23.900]  And then now in the space of three weeks, they've gone from saying Trump's crazy to
[01:44:23.900 --> 01:44:28.100]  admitting Trump's right in the Washington Post and the New York Times, the LA Times,
[01:44:28.100 --> 01:44:29.100]  Nancy Pelosi.
[01:44:29.100 --> 01:44:31.340]  Hey, how big a victory is that?
[01:44:31.340 --> 01:44:33.260]  What does it signify to you?
[01:44:33.260 --> 01:44:37.620]  And don't you think Trump should now victory lap and say, see, you know, I've been proven
[01:44:37.620 --> 01:44:38.620]  right?
[01:44:38.620 --> 01:44:41.500]  Yeah, I think a victory lap would be appropriate.
[01:44:41.500 --> 01:44:45.740]  I think, you know, if he could use his different forms of social media to get that message
[01:44:45.740 --> 01:44:49.860]  out there, that would definitely be beneficial to his cause and bringing the people together.
[01:44:49.860 --> 01:44:52.780]  Because realistically, the bigger goal is to bring people together.
[01:44:52.780 --> 01:44:56.980]  And it was unfortunate to see the left siding with Antifa, because I know Antifa firsthand.
[01:44:56.980 --> 01:45:00.980]  I've seen these people and I knew like even the left for as crazy as the things they've
[01:45:00.980 --> 01:45:03.940]  spout sometimes, they don't want to be involved with Antifa.
[01:45:03.940 --> 01:45:06.500]  So I think this is a big step.
[01:45:06.500 --> 01:45:11.620]  I think the violence will continue, but the more the violence continues, the more they
[01:45:11.620 --> 01:45:15.500]  get discredited and the quicker everyone kind of come together away from them.
[01:45:15.500 --> 01:45:19.220]  And realize maybe we're, you know, not as different as the extremes make us see.
[01:45:19.220 --> 01:45:20.220]  Exactly.
[01:45:20.220 --> 01:45:25.300]  And what do you think CNN and MSNBC and even NPR were thinking in the New York Times when
[01:45:25.300 --> 01:45:28.980]  they tried to mainline Antifa and go, well, violence is good because we're going to punch
[01:45:28.980 --> 01:45:29.980]  a Nazi.
[01:45:29.980 --> 01:45:34.500]  Didn't they know that would mean anybody that they projected onto the classic thing is,
[01:45:34.500 --> 01:45:39.140]  well, the average good old boys wouldn't go rob anybody because they're good Christians.
[01:45:39.140 --> 01:45:43.300]  But if it's a gay club, you can go beat somebody up and rob them and take their wallet or steal
[01:45:43.300 --> 01:45:46.900]  their car because, you know, they're, you know, fags or whatever to use the pejorative
[01:45:46.900 --> 01:45:50.940]  term that they would use quote, rolling queers or whatever, going to use a pejorative term.
[01:45:50.940 --> 01:45:54.860]  I'm not using that, but just to document it, that was a well-known phenomenon on the 50s,
[01:45:54.860 --> 01:45:56.540]  60s, 70s, 80s, 90s.
[01:45:56.540 --> 01:46:00.340]  It still happened some, but it seems like the new group is just say, oh, that's a white
[01:46:00.340 --> 01:46:01.900]  guy or that's a conservative.
[01:46:01.900 --> 01:46:06.500]  So I can now carry out these criminal energies on them, even though I'd never do it before.
[01:46:06.500 --> 01:46:09.020]  Now I'm morally green lighted to go do it.
[01:46:09.020 --> 01:46:10.020]  Yeah.
[01:46:10.020 --> 01:46:15.460]  It's scary, but at the same time, I think the media didn't realize who they were preaching
[01:46:15.460 --> 01:46:19.940]  to because they pushed this idea that there's Nazis and Neo, you know, neo-Nazis and white
[01:46:19.940 --> 01:46:22.980]  supremacists and the KKK and they're all Trump supporters.
[01:46:22.980 --> 01:46:26.660]  But the people they preach that to are very disenfranchised themselves.
[01:46:26.660 --> 01:46:29.460]  They don't have anything that's bigger than the, you know, that they can work towards.
[01:46:29.460 --> 01:46:30.460]  They're not involved in the church.
[01:46:30.460 --> 01:46:32.660]  Like I said, they, you know, are lost.
[01:46:32.660 --> 01:46:33.660]  They're lost.
[01:46:33.660 --> 01:46:34.660]  They're lost.
[01:46:34.660 --> 01:46:35.660]  They're lost.
[01:46:35.660 --> 01:46:40.620]  They're not, you know, exactly this thing to look up to, to be a part of, to be involved
[01:46:40.620 --> 01:46:41.620]  with their.
[01:46:41.620 --> 01:46:44.260]  And so they believe they're Brad Pitt and then glorious bastards.
[01:46:44.260 --> 01:46:45.260]  They think that.
[01:46:45.260 --> 01:46:48.980]  And it's scary because if anything like that actually happened and we needed America to
[01:46:48.980 --> 01:46:52.940]  step up and defend against domestic terrorists, it would be the Patriots going against them
[01:46:52.940 --> 01:46:53.940]  realistically.
[01:46:53.940 --> 01:46:55.660]  Well, that's right.
[01:46:55.660 --> 01:46:59.860]  And it's very insulting to have a weirdo Nazi collaborator to the Southern part.
[01:46:59.860 --> 01:47:02.180]  We lost her in ADL say, I'm a Nazi.
[01:47:02.180 --> 01:47:03.180]  What do you mean?
[01:47:03.180 --> 01:47:04.180]  He funds it.
[01:47:04.180 --> 01:47:05.180]  They say that they do that.
[01:47:05.180 --> 01:47:06.180]  I don't think I'll say it.
[01:47:06.180 --> 01:47:07.180]  I'll say it.
[01:47:07.180 --> 01:47:11.140]  It's very insulting as an American when, when my, both my grandfathers did, both of them,
[01:47:11.140 --> 01:47:16.460]  one of them crashed land and the other was, was actually had, had a sunburn in his eyes.
[01:47:16.460 --> 01:47:19.860]  The one day he didn't go up and the plane blew up and everybody got killed, you know,
[01:47:19.860 --> 01:47:22.900]  over, over Italy and the, and the Italy invasion on North Africa.
[01:47:22.900 --> 01:47:27.140]  And it almost beaten, almost not exist because of Nazis and then I'm being called a Nazi
[01:47:27.140 --> 01:47:29.700]  by a real living Nazi.
[01:47:29.700 --> 01:47:31.900]  Where are the Nazi hunters for George Soros?
[01:47:31.900 --> 01:47:37.300]  He went on 60 minutes and said, he's not ashamed of helping round up his fellow Jews
[01:47:37.300 --> 01:47:39.020]  because they would have killed him.
[01:47:39.020 --> 01:47:40.500]  What type of moral statement is that?
[01:47:40.500 --> 01:47:43.940]  I've had high level Hollywood producers go, Alex, you want to put a big movie out with
[01:47:43.940 --> 01:47:44.940]  you?
[01:47:44.940 --> 01:47:46.500]  This is like six, seven years ago, but you got to quit bashing Soros.
[01:47:46.500 --> 01:47:48.380]  You know, he did really needed to survive.
[01:47:48.380 --> 01:47:51.380]  If they came to me and said, round up your fellow Americans, we're going to kill you.
[01:47:51.380 --> 01:47:52.460]  I'd say, pull the trigger.
[01:47:52.460 --> 01:47:53.460]  You bastard.
[01:47:53.460 --> 01:47:56.420]  Yeah, it's insane.
[01:47:56.420 --> 01:48:00.740]  And it's almost like a big joke, I think, from Soros where he calls the group, you know,
[01:48:00.740 --> 01:48:04.300]  the anti-fascist, when meanwhile they're the most fascist group in America.
[01:48:04.300 --> 01:48:08.420]  It's almost like a big joke that is over their head completely, that they don't understand
[01:48:08.420 --> 01:48:12.340]  and they're just the pawns that bought in that are mindless drones now heading towards,
[01:48:12.340 --> 01:48:14.340]  you know, the common goal.
[01:48:14.340 --> 01:48:18.380]  I think with situations like this, we have to be careful with how we combat them.
[01:48:18.380 --> 01:48:21.100]  We have to come at them in a way that's not playing on their terms.
[01:48:21.100 --> 01:48:22.900]  We don't want to get violent, obviously.
[01:48:22.900 --> 01:48:26.620]  So I think the sooner we can expose them and show how clueless they are, the sooner everyone
[01:48:26.620 --> 01:48:30.020]  can kind of step away from them and disavow completely both sides.
[01:48:30.020 --> 01:48:31.020]  That's right.
[01:48:31.020 --> 01:48:32.620]  It's being reported right now by RT.
[01:48:32.620 --> 01:48:36.700]  I want to post the full article on inforwars.com and newswars.com, folks, and we're going
[01:48:36.700 --> 01:48:38.180]  to tweet this out.
[01:48:38.180 --> 01:48:43.460]  There's now 70,000 petitions to designate Soros as a terrorist and seize his assets.
[01:48:43.460 --> 01:48:46.300]  There's scores of countries have already convicted him.
[01:48:46.300 --> 01:48:50.740]  He's been caught doing it, and look, you know, we called for Antifa to be listed as a criminal
[01:48:50.740 --> 01:48:51.740]  gang.
[01:48:51.740 --> 01:48:56.340]  It turns out the FBI has declassified that the fact that they've already been listed
[01:48:56.340 --> 01:48:57.700]  as that for a year.
[01:48:57.700 --> 01:49:03.500]  So this is a big move, and it's time for us to morally call where are the Israeli Nazi
[01:49:03.500 --> 01:49:08.420]  hunters that are always finding some 90-year-old guard they're not sure and then having a trial.
[01:49:08.420 --> 01:49:09.420]  This is a real Nazi.
[01:49:09.420 --> 01:49:12.220]  Just because he's Jewish doesn't give him any excuse.
[01:49:12.220 --> 01:49:15.140]  This guy needs to be swat-teamed.
[01:49:15.140 --> 01:49:16.140]  Absolutely.
[01:49:16.140 --> 01:49:17.140]  Yeah.
[01:49:17.140 --> 01:49:22.460]  The comments he made about his involvement during, you know, the Nazi in Nazi Germany
[01:49:22.460 --> 01:49:23.460]  are ridiculous.
[01:49:23.460 --> 01:49:27.020]  And if anyone else was even associated with that on the right, we would not hear the
[01:49:27.020 --> 01:49:28.020]  end of it.
[01:49:28.020 --> 01:49:31.980]  But the fact that he said what he said, he's over the years even said things about, you
[01:49:31.980 --> 01:49:35.980]  know, wanting to destroy the United States, said, made a comment about that in the 70s.
[01:49:35.980 --> 01:49:38.100]  It's just, it's so in our face, it's so blatant.
[01:49:38.100 --> 01:49:41.140]  It's kind of the same thing that happens with someone like Linda Sarsour.
[01:49:41.140 --> 01:49:46.860]  They're so in our face and so obvious, and it's so against our cultural beliefs, but
[01:49:46.860 --> 01:49:48.780]  it just kind of gets ignored.
[01:49:48.780 --> 01:49:52.940]  And we fantasize about, you know, the Nazis in the U.S. when realistically the fastest
[01:49:52.940 --> 01:49:55.540]  groups we're dealing with are funded by the Nazis.
[01:49:55.540 --> 01:49:58.060]  It's ridiculous.
[01:49:58.060 --> 01:49:59.060]  That's right.
[01:49:59.060 --> 01:50:00.060]  Wow.
[01:50:00.060 --> 01:50:02.900]  I want to come back, take a few segments of calls with Austin Fletcher.
[01:50:02.900 --> 01:50:10.340]  Austin, do you think Antifa and leftist and shanties peaked, or is this a momentary setback
[01:50:10.340 --> 01:50:16.340]  as kind of America really gets sickened by them, and are they about to get even worse?
[01:50:16.340 --> 01:50:17.340]  I think we're at it.
[01:50:17.340 --> 01:50:18.340]  Yeah.
[01:50:18.340 --> 01:50:19.940]  We're at a juncture here for sure.
[01:50:19.940 --> 01:50:24.020]  I think Antifa is going to get worse and they're going to go more rogue and further
[01:50:24.020 --> 01:50:25.020]  left.
[01:50:25.020 --> 01:50:26.020]  I agree.
[01:50:26.020 --> 01:50:30.140]  Separate themselves from everybody, but I think there'll be an upside there as well,
[01:50:30.140 --> 01:50:32.500]  because we kind of need somebody for the country to get behind.
[01:50:32.500 --> 01:50:37.300]  Like obviously the situation in Texas of Harvey was horrible, but what the upside is, you
[01:50:37.300 --> 01:50:39.620]  know, that's where America comes together when times are bad.
[01:50:39.620 --> 01:50:44.820]  I was about to say, did Harvey basically, did the reins of Harvey as bad as they were
[01:50:44.820 --> 01:50:47.060]  put out the race for Soros wanted?
[01:50:47.060 --> 01:50:49.140]  That was my next question when we come back.
[01:50:49.140 --> 01:50:52.380]  And by the way, you know, it was James Rosie Rawls and our other great Pentagon sources
[01:50:52.380 --> 01:50:55.780]  that predicted Antifa will become the weatherman next.
[01:50:55.780 --> 01:50:59.300]  Are you one of the 15 million men who suffer from an enlarged prostate?
[01:50:59.300 --> 01:51:03.420]  If your life revolves around finding the closest bathroom, if you're tired of waking up many
[01:51:03.420 --> 01:51:07.780]  times a night to urinate, then you need to know about prostate miracle.
[01:51:07.780 --> 01:51:11.820]  Prostate miracle contains beta-cytosterone, which is 3,000 times stronger than salt bow
[01:51:11.820 --> 01:51:12.820]  metal.

[01:51:25.540 --> 01:51:29.500]  North Korea openly threatens the U.S. and launches a new missile every other week.
[01:51:29.500 --> 01:51:33.740]  Their warhead of choice, electromagnetic pulse, such an event would cripple the U.S. power
[01:51:33.740 --> 01:51:36.060]  grid for years and leave millions in the dark.

[01:55:55.460 --> 01:55:59.060]  Google and Facebook and Twitter censorship and all their attempts, we're turning the
[01:55:59.060 --> 01:56:00.060]  tide.
[01:56:00.060 --> 01:56:01.060]  We're winning.
[01:56:01.060 --> 01:56:07.140]  Now, again, we've got a very popular YouTuber, Austin Fletcher, with Fleckis Talks out in
[01:56:07.140 --> 01:56:14.020]  L.A., showing amazing footage of the Lib Tarts, who are very, very sad people, but hopefully
[01:56:14.020 --> 01:56:18.260]  by illustrating that they're not intellectual, that they are the victims of the global system,
[01:56:18.260 --> 01:56:22.980]  we can wake them up, follow him on Twitter at Fleckis as well.
[01:56:22.980 --> 01:56:29.380]  Okay, I want to go to Embry, since we're talking about Nazis, they're supposedly under every
[01:56:29.380 --> 01:56:36.060]  table, but the real Nazis, like Schwarzenegger, Mitzi loves Nazis, and George Soros get awards
[01:56:36.060 --> 01:56:37.060]  from the ADL.
[01:56:37.060 --> 01:56:39.340]  He's the actual Nazi that I'm going to get awards.
[01:56:39.340 --> 01:56:40.340]  Embry, you're on the air.
[01:56:40.340 --> 01:56:41.340]  Go ahead.
[01:56:41.340 --> 01:56:42.340]  Thanks, Alex.
[01:56:42.340 --> 01:56:45.420]  I'm enjoying this segment with you and Austin.
[01:56:45.420 --> 01:56:48.820]  I want to point out a false equivalency.
[01:56:48.820 --> 01:56:51.780]  I want to tell you what's equivalent and what's not.
[01:56:51.780 --> 01:56:57.940]  Right now, the polar opposites are Antifa and the white supremacists are Nazis.
[01:56:57.940 --> 01:57:00.780]  That's what we're being fed as an equivalence.
[01:57:00.780 --> 01:57:06.420]  The true equivalents are white supremacists are Nazis, black supremacists are Black Lives
[01:57:06.420 --> 01:57:12.220]  Matter, or Blotches, and Latino supremacists are LaRosa or LaRozzi.
[01:57:12.220 --> 01:57:13.220]  Those are equivalent.
[01:57:13.220 --> 01:57:14.220]  They are.
[01:57:14.220 --> 01:57:15.220]  They are.
[01:57:15.220 --> 01:57:18.820]  They're race-based, tribal-based, political systems, one of the most ancient forms.
[01:57:18.820 --> 01:57:19.820]  You're absolutely right.
[01:57:19.820 --> 01:57:22.420]  And the globalists want to play us all off against each other when the globalists are
[01:57:22.420 --> 01:57:27.300]  controlling the very racial clash.
[01:57:27.300 --> 01:57:32.180]  But as Americans, we accept that even though we may not take those views because we, the
[01:57:32.180 --> 01:57:33.420]  First Amendment.
[01:57:33.420 --> 01:57:38.020]  But the second that Antifa starts getting violent, I don't care if you're a movement
[01:57:38.020 --> 01:57:43.900]  on the left, center, right, white, Mexican, black, Chinese, whatever.
[01:57:43.900 --> 01:57:48.700]  The second you start getting violent, this is no longer a First Amendment issue.
[01:57:48.700 --> 01:57:51.620]  These people need to be arrested, frankly.
[01:57:51.620 --> 01:57:52.620]  No, I agree.
[01:57:52.620 --> 01:57:54.460]  They need to have their asses handed to them.
[01:57:54.460 --> 01:57:58.740]  I want to give conservatives really a laurel and just people that were out being beat up
[01:57:58.740 --> 01:58:01.500]  and letting them beat them up because I can't do that.
[01:58:01.500 --> 01:58:04.460]  Man, I'm gonna let them throw coffee on me and stuff.
[01:58:04.460 --> 01:58:11.060]  Really blow up in their face that we took the Gandhi Road.
[01:58:11.060 --> 01:58:12.060]  Stay there, Embry.
[01:58:12.060 --> 01:58:14.300]  I'm gonna come back to you after the break and with our other guest, Austin.
[01:58:14.300 --> 01:58:18.140]  Austin, do you agree that conservatives taking the Gandhi Road really blew up in the leftist
[01:58:18.140 --> 01:58:19.140]  faces?
[01:58:19.140 --> 01:58:20.140]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:58:20.140 --> 01:58:22.180]  And I think it's something I didn't expect.
[01:58:22.180 --> 01:58:25.820]  They kind of thought they'd be baiting us into, you know, engaging in violence when
[01:58:25.820 --> 01:58:29.780]  realistically, like with my channel at least, I know that they're used to fighting the
[01:58:29.780 --> 01:58:30.780]  emotional fights.
[01:58:30.780 --> 01:58:32.620]  They're used to getting, you know, loud in each other's faces.
[01:58:32.620 --> 01:58:33.620]  Stay there.
[01:58:33.620 --> 01:58:35.100]  I want to hear about this, but let me tell you.
[01:58:35.100 --> 01:58:37.260]  Why is this serpent as peaceful as Dove's?
[01:58:37.260 --> 01:58:38.660]  Walks softly, carry a big stick.
[01:58:38.660 --> 01:58:41.580]  I mean, just great self-control, folks.
[01:58:41.580 --> 01:58:43.100]  Real intellect.
[01:58:43.100 --> 01:58:44.100]  Real will.
[01:58:44.100 --> 01:58:45.100]  You're beautiful.
[01:58:45.100 --> 01:58:49.340]  Dr. Group, you developed living defense for us.
[01:58:49.340 --> 01:58:50.740]  It took you over a year to do it.
[01:58:50.740 --> 01:58:52.460]  Why is this so good?
[01:58:52.460 --> 01:58:57.020]  Because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most.
[01:58:57.020 --> 01:59:01.780]  I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in
[01:59:01.780 --> 01:59:02.780]  my system.
[01:59:02.780 --> 01:59:08.020]  But right now, we're dealing with massive parasites, which is anything that's harmful
[01:59:08.020 --> 01:59:13.300]  to your body that lives off a host mechanism right now with all the refugees spreading
[01:59:13.300 --> 01:59:14.560]  disease around.
[01:59:14.560 --> 01:59:17.180]  We have biological warfare going on everywhere.
[01:59:17.180 --> 01:59:18.180]  These are all parasites.
[01:59:18.180 --> 01:59:20.900]  Tell us about all the stuff that says there's so many things that are in it.
[01:59:20.900 --> 01:59:22.140]  You have the neem in there.
[01:59:22.140 --> 01:59:25.220]  You have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood.
[01:59:25.220 --> 01:59:28.500]  I recommend doing a parasite cleanse at least twice a year.
[01:59:28.500 --> 01:59:29.500]  All right.
[01:59:29.500 --> 01:59:31.700]  Well, I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today.
[01:59:31.700 --> 01:59:32.860]  It just came back in yesterday.
[01:59:32.860 --> 01:59:33.860]  Living Defense, infowarslife.com.
[01:59:33.860 --> 01:59:34.860]  And folks, you can't lose.
[01:59:34.860 --> 01:59:38.540]  It's full of stuff that's great for your body, period.
[01:59:38.540 --> 01:59:41.820]  And you support the broadcast, infowarslife.com.
[01:59:41.820 --> 01:59:44.020]  Thank you, Dr. Group, from the Global Healing Center.
[01:59:44.020 --> 01:59:49.340]  Thank you so much for all your work, sir, on this great product.
[01:59:49.340 --> 01:59:59.020]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show, crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[01:59:59.020 --> 02:00:07.340]  It's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network.
[02:00:07.340 --> 02:00:17.940]  Embry, what's great about talking libertarians and patriots of Embry, race, color, and creed
[02:00:17.940 --> 02:00:22.420]  is they're just humans and they're smart, and it doesn't mean we don't have some dull
[02:00:22.420 --> 02:00:24.060]  knives in our doors as well.
[02:00:24.060 --> 02:00:28.500]  And a few of us have screws loose, and I think I do.
[02:00:28.500 --> 02:00:31.860]  But genius and crazy, they say it's a close thing.
[02:00:31.860 --> 02:00:36.020]  I'm not claiming I'm on the genius side, but a little bit on the crazy side.
[02:00:36.020 --> 02:00:41.500]  But classic Black Lives Matter, classic Mecheloraza, they're just the same thing as white supremacist
[02:00:41.500 --> 02:00:42.500]  groups.
[02:00:42.500 --> 02:00:43.500]  They're race-based groups, and I get it.
[02:00:43.500 --> 02:00:44.500]  They think they've been attacked.
[02:00:44.500 --> 02:00:45.500]  They're getting into a group.
[02:00:45.500 --> 02:00:46.500]  It's primitive.
[02:00:46.500 --> 02:00:50.860]  The question, ethos, is this big, open thing, and it makes successful societies.
[02:00:50.860 --> 02:00:54.060]  The question is, the Democrats, the Globals are trying to sabotage it.
[02:00:54.060 --> 02:00:55.060]  What do we do about it?
[02:00:55.060 --> 02:00:57.180]  Then I'll ask Austin Fletcher the same question.
[02:00:57.180 --> 02:01:03.340]  Well, you hit something at the break that is so true, and it's actually given me hope.
[02:01:03.340 --> 02:01:07.980]  I've been pretty dark for a couple of months with all this, but what I'm encouraged by
[02:01:07.980 --> 02:01:15.780]  is that we have not reacted ridiculous violence with these violent people, and we are going
[02:01:15.780 --> 02:01:21.220]  to defeat these people and still be right, and I'm really, really encouraged by that.
[02:01:21.220 --> 02:01:22.220]  We are defeating them.
[02:01:22.220 --> 02:01:23.220]  God bless you.
[02:01:23.220 --> 02:01:24.220]  Thanks for the call.
[02:01:24.220 --> 02:01:25.220]  Embry made some great points.
[02:01:25.220 --> 02:01:27.140]  Austin, the Empire, is going to strike back, though.
[02:01:27.140 --> 02:01:30.900]  The establishment engineers are kind of backing away from their little minions right now,
[02:01:30.900 --> 02:01:34.700]  because it's exposed the fraud, but how are they going to strike back?
[02:01:34.700 --> 02:01:35.700]  You know, they're not going to give up.
[02:01:35.700 --> 02:01:38.860]  I mean, Mueller wants to cook something up on Trump.
[02:01:38.860 --> 02:01:42.740]  They're claiming a judge can block Trump's pardon right now.
[02:01:42.740 --> 02:01:43.940]  They're really going after Trump.
[02:01:43.940 --> 02:01:49.220]  He's not perfect, but I think if they get our figurehead, that will embolden them.
[02:01:49.220 --> 02:01:50.620]  Absolutely.
[02:01:50.620 --> 02:01:54.500]  I think right now, the good news is we're on the right side of history.
[02:01:54.500 --> 02:01:55.500]  We're the good guys.
[02:01:55.500 --> 02:01:59.980]  We're an underdog story, for sure, which is my favorite kind of thing to be a part of.
[02:01:59.980 --> 02:02:01.180]  I love the underdog story.
[02:02:01.180 --> 02:02:02.420]  I love fighting the good fight.
[02:02:02.420 --> 02:02:08.340]  I love being based in facts and honesty and, you know, love for the country at a bigger
[02:02:08.340 --> 02:02:09.340]  level.
[02:02:09.340 --> 02:02:10.340]  You love being centered.
[02:02:10.340 --> 02:02:11.340]  You love being informed.
[02:02:11.340 --> 02:02:12.340]  You love being connected to God.
[02:02:12.340 --> 02:02:13.340]  Exactly.
[02:02:13.340 --> 02:02:14.340]  I do.
[02:02:14.340 --> 02:02:16.020]  And that's what the left lacks.
[02:02:16.020 --> 02:02:19.500]  And I think the left, like we were mentioning before, is used to the tactics of getting
[02:02:19.500 --> 02:02:22.860]  violent and baiting people and starting, you know, civil unrest.
[02:02:22.860 --> 02:02:24.260]  Dirty tricks.
[02:02:24.260 --> 02:02:25.260]  Dirty tricks.
[02:02:25.260 --> 02:02:29.780]  And the new rights response now, which they weren't expecting, is debating in facts and
[02:02:29.780 --> 02:02:33.740]  having conversations and being the peaceful ones and having group, you know, group events
[02:02:33.740 --> 02:02:37.740]  that include minorities and all this different diversity of all different types of people.
[02:02:37.740 --> 02:02:40.660]  And we're playing them in their own game, in a way, and they don't know how to react
[02:02:40.660 --> 02:02:41.660]  to it.
[02:02:41.660 --> 02:02:44.260]  The violent they get, the worse they look, the sooner we react.
[02:02:44.260 --> 02:02:47.780]  Plus, it was Republicans that were in abolition and the Republicans that passed the Civil
[02:02:47.780 --> 02:02:48.780]  Rights Act.
[02:02:48.780 --> 02:02:51.300]  We just let the left hijack all that.
[02:02:51.300 --> 02:02:53.060]  Yeah, we did.
[02:02:53.060 --> 02:02:58.740]  And it's unfortunate now because whenever we tell them, you know, the left is responsible
[02:02:58.740 --> 02:02:59.740]  for the KKK.
[02:02:59.740 --> 02:03:03.020]  The Democrats and the KKK went hand in hand for years and years.
[02:03:03.020 --> 02:03:06.900]  The big switch was actually not a big switch.
[02:03:06.900 --> 02:03:10.860]  They don't believe it because we're like the right-wing conspiracy people when realistically
[02:03:10.860 --> 02:03:14.020]  we're based in facts and they just rather live in this world of ignorance where they
[02:03:14.020 --> 02:03:15.820]  can kind of keep floating around with people.
[02:03:15.820 --> 02:03:16.820]  Sure.
[02:03:16.820 --> 02:03:19.580]  The Democrats joined the Communists and joined all these other groups and then conservatives
[02:03:19.580 --> 02:03:21.260]  went, no, no, we're not going to have a race war.
[02:03:21.260 --> 02:03:25.140]  We're not saying whites are bad as, you know, or something.
[02:03:25.140 --> 02:03:26.140]  We're going to not be racist.
[02:03:26.140 --> 02:03:27.380]  We're going to be fair.
[02:03:27.380 --> 02:03:30.300]  That's what old line, Barry Goldwater Republicans did.
[02:03:30.300 --> 02:03:34.100]  And then now you look at the Democrats, I mean, WikiLeaks, it just says we're going to use
[02:03:34.100 --> 02:03:35.220]  culture war.
[02:03:35.220 --> 02:03:36.220]  That means race war.
[02:03:36.220 --> 02:03:37.220]  That's their plan.
[02:03:37.220 --> 02:03:38.220]  Yeah.
[02:03:38.220 --> 02:03:42.460]  And it's getting tricky and it's like you said before, it's dirty tricks.
[02:03:42.460 --> 02:03:43.820]  It's all they can do now.
[02:03:43.820 --> 02:03:45.660]  So we have to know their game.
[02:03:45.660 --> 02:03:48.020]  We know the game they're playing, how they play it.
[02:03:48.020 --> 02:03:52.380]  We got to just in their face combat them in every way we can non-violently and that's
[02:03:52.380 --> 02:03:53.380]  what I do with my channel.
[02:03:53.380 --> 02:03:56.500]  It's like, you know, they're used to fighting these emotional wars and getting in people's
[02:03:56.500 --> 02:03:57.780]  faces and baiting people.
[02:03:57.780 --> 02:04:01.020]  They're not used to someone, you know, with the microphone in their face saying like,
[02:04:01.020 --> 02:04:02.020]  oh, what are you doing here?
[02:04:02.020 --> 02:04:03.020]  Like super calm.
[02:04:03.020 --> 02:04:05.980]  And that's where they fail because they aren't based in facts.
[02:04:05.980 --> 02:04:08.020]  They aren't based in truth and honesty.
[02:04:08.020 --> 02:04:11.580]  And that's where they can't back up their, you know, radical ideas.
[02:04:11.580 --> 02:04:15.220]  They truly are lost followers of a system that's abusing them.
[02:04:15.220 --> 02:04:17.980]  And so they run into a real intellectual.
[02:04:17.980 --> 02:04:19.460]  They're destroyed.
[02:04:19.460 --> 02:04:20.980]  Absolutely.
[02:04:20.980 --> 02:04:23.500]  The left is just, this has been their game forever.
[02:04:23.500 --> 02:04:29.380]  They just pray on the minds of the people who aren't involved in politics, don't care.
[02:04:29.380 --> 02:04:33.060]  All of my friends, you know, anyone under 30, I know out in LA especially, I asked them
[02:04:33.060 --> 02:04:36.420]  about politics and they'll say, oh, you know, that pardon was bad.
[02:04:36.420 --> 02:04:38.220]  And I'll say, why was it bad?
[02:04:38.220 --> 02:04:40.380]  And they don't even know what the, you know, what the guy, exactly.
[02:04:40.380 --> 02:04:41.740]  Cause they don't even get their news from CNN.
[02:04:41.740 --> 02:04:43.140]  They get it from cow bear.
[02:04:43.140 --> 02:04:47.540]  Uh, Fleckis talks is the YouTube site, Austin Fletcher will be talking to you more.
[02:04:47.540 --> 02:04:48.540]  You're awesome.
[02:04:48.540 --> 02:04:51.020]  We'll be right back with Jack Masovic and more of your phone call.
[02:04:51.020 --> 02:04:52.020]  Stay with us.
[02:04:52.020 --> 02:04:53.020]  Extend them.
[02:04:53.020 --> 02:05:02.780]  We've got great air filters, great water filters, great non GMRL MCs, great books, great films,
[02:05:02.780 --> 02:05:04.660]  great patriot apparel to meet like minded people.
[02:05:04.660 --> 02:05:09.860]  We've got a new humongoid sale, not the number of things that are on massive sale, but on
[02:05:09.860 --> 02:05:13.100]  what's on sale out for months, not been on sale for months and months.
[02:05:13.100 --> 02:05:18.020]  We've never offered super male vitality, no concentrated herbs, cold pressed, super
[02:05:18.020 --> 02:05:20.820]  male vitality, 57% off.
[02:05:20.820 --> 02:05:26.900]  It's never been the price it is right now with 3,596 reviews, 4.6 reviews total by third
[02:05:26.900 --> 02:05:30.180]  party sites, unprecedented and it's cold pressed.
[02:05:30.180 --> 02:05:32.020]  That's why super male is so different.
[02:05:32.020 --> 02:05:34.940]  People say, well, I know these compounds work because it's admitted to science and these
[02:05:34.940 --> 02:05:35.940]  are what you sell.
[02:05:35.940 --> 02:05:38.260]  They, BuzzFeed said, it's like, it's already best selling stuff.
[02:05:38.260 --> 02:05:40.340]  It's been certified as healthy and good forever.
[02:05:40.340 --> 02:05:41.620]  Why these aren't anything new?
[02:05:41.620 --> 02:05:49.620]  Because why do something new when you can have the oldest and best, but cold pressed?
[02:05:49.620 --> 02:05:53.500]  Boo.
[02:05:53.500 --> 02:05:57.860]  We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own four years
[02:05:57.860 --> 02:06:02.580]  of seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature
[02:06:02.580 --> 02:06:04.100]  to detoxify the body.
[02:06:04.100 --> 02:06:08.980]  That's why I'm introducing Z Shield, Toxic Metal and Chemical Defense Support.
[02:06:08.980 --> 02:06:10.500]  It's made in the USA.
[02:06:10.500 --> 02:06:15.420]  It's filled with known compounds from nature that are absolutely associated with detoxifying
[02:06:15.420 --> 02:06:20.660]  the body and it supports the info or it is a classical 360 when this is the formula that
[02:06:20.660 --> 02:06:23.060]  I personally have been taking for over a year.
[02:06:23.060 --> 02:06:27.940]  And now we believe we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier as

[02:40:00.500 --> 02:40:04.500]  Sobeck.
[02:40:04.500 --> 02:40:18.420]  Sobeck.
[02:40:18.420 --> 02:40:28.420]  Sobeck.
[02:40:28.420 --> 02:40:32.420]  Sobeck.
[02:40:32.420 --> 02:40:38.820]  by them. The day started out early, September, excuse me, August 27th. I was there with Latinos
[02:40:38.820 --> 02:40:46.180]  for Trump, leader Margueritas, Jolie Val from Brooklyn, New York, and with Marco's son Michael,
[02:40:46.180 --> 02:40:49.540]  and we have another guy named Fred Garvey. He's from North Carolina initially, but he now lives
[02:40:49.540 --> 02:40:54.340]  in Alameda County. So you've got a hard core conservative in deep blue Alameda, a lot of
[02:40:54.340 --> 02:40:59.060]  hard core conservatives. We were there, we were going to find free speech, we were going to make
[02:40:59.060 --> 02:41:03.300]  our stand for Trump in the bluest of blue cities, in the bluest of states, and nothing was going
[02:41:03.300 --> 02:41:08.820]  to deter us. So we were walking up to the Martin Luther King Jr. Park. We actually met some Berkeley
[02:41:08.820 --> 02:41:12.980]  residents along the way. They even took our pictures. They were glad to see us there. They said,
[02:41:12.980 --> 02:41:19.780]  be safe and be civil. We always intend to be. We've never been disruptive or violent in these
[02:41:19.780 --> 02:41:26.900]  events. I got to the park, I saw a whole bunch of police officers clad in riot gear. There was
[02:41:26.900 --> 02:41:32.340]  the city police, and even the Alameda County, they had their sheriff's deputies there on site.
[02:41:32.340 --> 02:41:38.500]  So it was like a well-fortress area. They had bulwark set up. They even searched us to make
[02:41:38.500 --> 02:41:44.100]  sure that we didn't have any weapons. This was a no weapons zone, no guns. This was a gun control
[02:41:44.100 --> 02:41:49.780]  zone, a mace control zone. Of course, that never stops the bad guys. How about that? Surprise.
[02:41:50.500 --> 02:41:54.020]  One of our friends was Fred Garvey. He refused to go in because he insisted on being able to
[02:41:54.020 --> 02:41:58.500]  protect himself. That's another thing. You kind of walk into a trap, and I want to walk through
[02:41:58.500 --> 02:42:02.020]  everything that happened, but let's kind of skip to the end and then back to the front again with
[02:42:02.020 --> 02:42:06.100]  one of the main victims of this. We only see a few shots. You being maced from behind,
[02:42:06.100 --> 02:42:11.620]  hit, you know, screamed at, chased. Then we see media all around videotaping. I guess halfway
[02:42:11.620 --> 02:42:18.900]  blocking the crowd while you take a rest from the frothing crowds. How long did the attacks on you
[02:42:18.900 --> 02:42:27.780]  go, and what can we not see on the tape? Okay, so let's start with, it was 115. All the police have
[02:42:27.780 --> 02:42:32.740]  fled Martin Luther King, Jr. Park, which was like crazy in itself. I'm like, why are you guys leaving?
[02:42:32.740 --> 02:42:37.300]  You know, we've got thugs that are still here. I got text messages and people were leaving me
[02:42:37.300 --> 02:42:42.740]  voicemail saying, Arthur, you've got to get out of the park, and Tifa is coming. And so I tried
[02:42:42.740 --> 02:42:47.220]  to get my team together, and we started to go north towards Center Street. And then I see the
[02:42:47.220 --> 02:42:51.620]  police in right here, they're walking away. And I go, the best thing I can do is to stay near the
[02:42:51.620 --> 02:42:57.060]  police, but they're walking away. And I got to follow them. I turn around and I see two thugs
[02:42:57.060 --> 02:43:01.620]  in black shirts, black from top to bottom. They're walking towards me. And then they were picking
[02:43:01.620 --> 02:43:08.260]  up the pace. So I started walking more quickly. And so, you know, it was pretty scary time,
[02:43:08.260 --> 02:43:13.220]  let me tell you. Within a minute, I felt the hat being taken off my head. I was walking north on
[02:43:13.220 --> 02:43:20.660]  Martin Luther King Junior Street. Then they ripped the cape off of my back, and my glasses flew off
[02:43:20.660 --> 02:43:25.540]  with it. And then I felt the pepper spray hitting me in the back of the head. And then I got glitter
[02:43:25.540 --> 02:43:32.660]  bombed. So I felt a warmth along my skin, along my arms, the back of my head. It didn't get worse
[02:43:32.660 --> 02:43:37.540]  until later. And I see all of these, there were more press agents surrounding me than there were
[02:43:37.540 --> 02:43:41.540]  police. And then I see more thugs that were running after me. So then I try to, there you see me,
[02:43:41.540 --> 02:43:45.700]  they're trying to cross the street. And then I thought of that one lady, the beautiful lady at
[02:43:45.700 --> 02:43:51.060]  the San Jose round. And she was cornered. That was last year. And she got egg thrown at her and
[02:43:51.060 --> 02:43:55.700]  everything else. The best thing I could think of was to go to a, go to a building and sit there
[02:43:55.700 --> 02:44:02.660]  and make the press form a wall around me. And that's the way that I walked into the station there.
[02:44:02.660 --> 02:44:07.860]  I'm the corner, get burst from Martin Luther King Street. And I sat down and rested. I refused to
[02:44:07.860 --> 02:44:11.860]  run away. And my running away, I wasn't going to get to my car. I wasn't going to have these thugs
[02:44:11.860 --> 02:44:18.580]  finding out where I had parked. I sat down, I prayed, I meditated. My two favorite verses,
[02:44:18.580 --> 02:44:24.340]  Isaiah 5417, no weapon for me against me shall prosper. Every time that rises against me,
[02:44:24.340 --> 02:44:29.380]  in judgment I condemn. And first John 417, as Christ is so are we in this world.
[02:44:29.380 --> 02:44:33.700]  There was a real, I was safe, I was actually in a way safe there. You know, you got all these
[02:44:33.700 --> 02:44:37.780]  press are putting me shoving their cameras in my face, trying to record me. There were three
[02:44:37.780 --> 02:44:42.020]  Antifa thugs there. They were shouting at me. One guy was calling me all manner of evil, Nazi
[02:44:42.020 --> 02:44:46.980]  go home. But I stood there and I condemned white supremacy. And I added, I condemned the white
[02:44:46.980 --> 02:44:53.140]  supremacy of the Democratic Party. And I demand that they renounce their history of racism.
[02:44:53.140 --> 02:44:57.620]  I continue to stumb for my president and support Trump because he's bringing jobs back, wages are
[02:44:57.620 --> 02:45:03.620]  up, jobs are up, illegal. I continued to do what I had done in the park. I was not going to stop
[02:45:03.620 --> 02:45:09.460]  speaking freely. Within about two minutes, finally, a police officer from the Berkeley,
[02:45:09.460 --> 02:45:15.060]  the police department showed up, cleared the crowd. And I said, you know, I need help. I'm
[02:45:15.060 --> 02:45:19.460]  not being protected. I don't know why. He brought me up. He said, do you need medical attention?
[02:45:20.180 --> 02:45:25.860]  And I said, no, at the time. And then he said, I will escort you to the sidewalk. Really? I needed
[02:45:25.860 --> 02:45:31.140]  to be escorted to my car. That's what I had gotten at Chrissy Field yesterday from the federal police.
[02:45:31.140 --> 02:45:35.220]  Exactly. He'd have been a leftist attack that had you on every TV show like you were God.
[02:45:35.220 --> 02:45:39.780]  And he noticed these are Democrat controlled cities like Charlottesville,
[02:45:39.780 --> 02:45:43.220]  like San Francisco, where this is allowed. And then you have Berkeley, where they're talking
[02:45:43.220 --> 02:45:48.980]  about cancelling all conservative events because the left's too violent, giving into them. So
[02:45:48.980 --> 02:45:53.540]  there are some defeats. But overall, do you agree with me that this is a big victory,
[02:45:53.540 --> 02:45:57.940]  that Berkeley was the tipping point? Because if you and so many others being beaten up,
[02:45:57.940 --> 02:46:02.180]  but taking it very Christ-like, Gandhi-like, Martin Luther King-like, not because you're
[02:46:02.180 --> 02:46:06.340]  wimps because you're so strong. Believe me, I don't think I could take it. And I mean,
[02:46:06.340 --> 02:46:09.300]  I took God's run coffee on me, but that was about it. I was ready after that to knock him
[02:46:09.300 --> 02:46:14.420]  upside the head. He hit me with the coffee mug, but I gotta really speak to that. I, you know,
[02:46:14.420 --> 02:46:17.780]  I got, I got contacts from black Trump supporters and they said, Arthur,
[02:46:17.780 --> 02:46:22.980]  this was the Rosa Parks moment. And I say that right now, there are four and a half million
[02:46:22.980 --> 02:46:27.300]  Trump supporters in the state of California. We will not sit in the back of the bus. We will not
[02:46:27.300 --> 02:46:31.620]  be treated like second-class citizens. And if we have to, if we have to march on to every public
[02:46:31.620 --> 02:46:37.860]  venue in the state of California and the left to shut down every damn park in the state of
[02:46:37.860 --> 02:46:42.340]  California, just as black civil rights, they just refuse to be bullied and refuse to be treated
[02:46:42.340 --> 02:46:45.300]  like second-class citizens, which is not going to have it. We're not going to have a set of
[02:46:45.300 --> 02:46:49.140]  laws for Antifa and the left and a set of laws for the rest of us, which is not going to have it.
[02:46:49.140 --> 02:46:52.500]  I want to wrap this up really quick. I didn't get to share this with David Knight. So the
[02:46:52.500 --> 02:46:58.580]  police officer offers to walk me to a sidewalk, but just God's perfect timing. When I show up,
[02:46:59.140 --> 02:47:02.660]  when I got there, three of my friends with the red elephants, Vincent James is the head of it,
[02:47:02.660 --> 02:47:06.500]  they drove right there. They saw me and they said, Arthur, get in the car. And it was just
[02:47:06.500 --> 02:47:09.860]  perfect timing. There was even a journalist there who helped me to my car and said, because you
[02:47:09.860 --> 02:47:14.420]  stand with the Constitution, I stand with you. It didn't stop there though, Alex. After I got in
[02:47:14.420 --> 02:47:18.500]  the car and we drove out of the square, there I am right there telling the audience how I got
[02:47:18.500 --> 02:47:23.380]  pepper sprayed on the side. And I haven't even related how bad that was yet, mind you. So
[02:47:23.380 --> 02:47:27.540]  we're driving the car and we have to get out of that square. But we found that there were other
[02:47:27.540 --> 02:47:32.740]  drivers. They recognized us and they began to follow us. There was a car in front of us that
[02:47:32.740 --> 02:47:38.660]  backed up, tried to break into us. We had to, Vincent James had to drive around the city,
[02:47:38.660 --> 02:47:44.340]  had to make sharp turns. So the left is in a road warrior craze right now. How bad is this
[02:47:44.340 --> 02:47:50.340]  going to get? Or will it help now that CNN, MSNBC are starting? They've been endorsing Antifa.
[02:47:50.340 --> 02:47:54.420]  At least they're not endorsing them now. I mean, shouldn't we call them CNN, MSNBC,
[02:47:54.420 --> 02:47:58.260]  that have endorsed Antifa violence? Aren't they really liable for this? I mean, if I called for
[02:47:58.260 --> 02:48:02.980]  my listeners to go out and attack people and said, your enemies are Nazis, you know, if they're a
[02:48:02.980 --> 02:48:07.540]  Democrat, don't knock them in the head with a hammer, I could go to prison for that for racketeering.
[02:48:07.540 --> 02:48:13.860]  So I mean, I really think they're liable. Yes, absolutely. I am urging Attorney General Jeff
[02:48:13.860 --> 02:48:20.260]  Sessions to initiate a Rico racketeer influence corrupt organizations investigation into Antifa.
[02:48:20.260 --> 02:48:24.420]  They'll find big money behind it. And we need to start knocking down heads and shutting off
[02:48:24.420 --> 02:48:28.660]  their money and putting them in jail. And I got to wrap this up. What happened with the chasing?
[02:48:28.660 --> 02:48:33.860]  You talk about road rage. You got that right. We even went to a police station where there were a
[02:48:33.860 --> 02:48:40.340]  whole bunch of California highway patrol cruisers. We were trying to get safety. You'd think that
[02:48:40.340 --> 02:48:44.260]  you'd be able to find safety there. All these cars are sitting there going nowhere. And then a
[02:48:44.260 --> 02:48:48.740]  police officer comes out to us and starts harassing us. And when we're saying we're looking for safety,
[02:48:48.740 --> 02:48:53.540]  and then he says, don't give me that crap. You're lying to me. Get out of here. He was about ready
[02:48:53.540 --> 02:48:58.740]  to cite us for being there. This is the Berkeley police department. This is what the highway
[02:48:58.740 --> 02:49:03.860]  patrol was doing in that area was unreal. Well, that's what they do. They protect, you know,
[02:49:03.860 --> 02:49:09.780]  women being beaten up by 50 thugs with bike locks and almost killed. It is, I mean, left as police
[02:49:09.780 --> 02:49:13.700]  are incredibly shameful creatures. Because even if you don't agree with somebody's politics,
[02:49:13.700 --> 02:49:16.500]  you have a duty to protect them. These are dishonorable people.
[02:49:18.740 --> 02:49:22.100]  I would agree. And we had to have it. The chief of that is the chief of police,
[02:49:22.100 --> 02:49:27.700]  Greenwood, who, who ordered the police to leave the park. He told them to stand down because he
[02:49:27.700 --> 02:49:32.740]  didn't want conflict. And in Charlottesville, they ordered the police to march, uh, the near
[02:49:32.740 --> 02:49:37.700]  due wells mainly through the group of other idiots, triggering the whole deal. But here's your prayer
[02:49:37.700 --> 02:49:42.100]  meeting attacked. But that's what blew up in their face was it was multicultural, multi,
[02:49:42.100 --> 02:49:46.660]  you know, everything. And it totally blew up in their face. And, you know, you're a modern guy
[02:49:46.660 --> 02:49:53.220]  in the Christlike mold of what you've done. And we want to commend you, Mr. Shopper, Arthur Shopper.

[02:49:59.300 --> 02:50:04.820]  Shopper, Arthur C. Sharper on Twitter. Thank you so much for joining us. And you got 30 seconds
[02:50:04.820 --> 02:50:12.340]  to finish up. Absolutely. I want to say I finally got home. The pepper spray, the burning was so
[02:50:12.340 --> 02:50:16.980]  intense. I had to stand under a shower for an hour. I could not rest. I couldn't defer the pain. It
[02:50:16.980 --> 02:50:22.900]  was so bad. I am so glad to finally get this out. The media was forced to acknowledge that Antifa is
[02:50:22.900 --> 02:50:29.780]  evil. I am proud that I was forced to make Nancy Pelosi condemn Antifa unequivocally
[02:50:29.780 --> 02:50:34.100]  her words. And even Paul Ryan had to finally get on board. It's not true. That's right. You drew the
[02:50:34.100 --> 02:50:38.260]  evil out. Yeah, even the Republican establishment wouldn't condemn him. What a grip of filthy,
[02:50:38.260 --> 02:50:43.300]  degenerate cowards. Most of these mainline Republicans are Republicans in name only,
[02:50:43.300 --> 02:50:47.700]  but we're forcing them out in the open. All right, Josh and Brett, you're coming up. Thank you,
[02:50:47.700 --> 02:51:13.700]  Arthur. You're amazing. Look forward to speaking to him again. Stay with us.

[02:54:08.500 --> 02:54:14.420]  I'm going to cover something
[02:54:16.980 --> 02:54:23.060]  that is absolutely critical to defeating the globalists and their main political theory
[02:54:23.940 --> 02:54:29.780]  outside of collectivist enslavement. There's actually a top-down system, the opposite of what
[02:54:29.780 --> 02:54:34.820]  they claim. You want to have a revolution against these tyrants and restore the republic. You've
[02:54:34.820 --> 02:54:39.940]  got to understand their greatest tactic is they're so bold, they're so extreme, they're so over the
[02:54:39.940 --> 02:54:45.380]  top that you don't even want to respond to them and say what they are because it sounds crazy.
[02:54:45.940 --> 02:54:49.860]  It's like saying the UK has been basically discovered to be run by a bunch of pedophile
[02:54:49.860 --> 02:54:54.980]  rings. I said that 15 years ago, others said it before me and then now it's mainstream news
[02:54:55.860 --> 02:54:59.700]  or that the highest levels of the Vatican are pedophile rings. Now it's mainstream news with
[02:54:59.700 --> 02:55:05.140]  the deputy pope basically indicted for running child kidnapping operations. Colonel Shaper's
[02:55:05.140 --> 02:55:09.780]  amazing guy broke so much the Benghazi news, government working with Al Qaeda news, you name it.
[02:55:10.820 --> 02:55:14.260]  Then we're going to your calls in a moment. He comes on yesterday, he goes, yeah,
[02:55:14.260 --> 02:55:17.700]  Phil Mudd of the CIA went on and said we're getting ready to kill the president. They're
[02:55:17.700 --> 02:55:24.180]  pushing COG, they're pushing his overthrow, they're pushing race riots, they're clearly gearing up to
[02:55:24.180 --> 02:55:29.860]  carry out a coup. So I tweeted the name of the video earlier from yesterday. We'll put my Twitter
[02:55:29.860 --> 02:55:34.900]  up on screen, real Alex Jones on Twitter. Even if you haven't been on Twitter, it's an enemy
[02:55:35.620 --> 02:55:38.660]  platform that we need you to go there and follow me at real Alex Jones. You can
[02:55:38.660 --> 02:55:42.500]  help get these out. We're going to go to real Alex Jones on Twitter or I can type it up,
[02:55:42.500 --> 02:55:47.300]  I guess, punch this shooter up, this computer's down, I can do it myself. And if you go there,
[02:55:47.300 --> 02:55:54.260]  you can see my Twitter. And you can see, then if you go to Colonel Shaper, I was just
[02:55:54.260 --> 02:55:59.220]  during the break out there, they got it up. You can see my tweet, Alex is a bit dramatic,
[02:55:59.220 --> 02:56:06.180]  but I stand by my assessment, global enemies would be emboldened by a coup attempt on POTUS.
[02:56:07.860 --> 02:56:12.260]  Now I get why Shaper is not throwing me into the bus there. He knows psychological
[02:56:12.260 --> 02:56:16.660]  operations and he knows it sounds crazy to say there's a coup against the president.
[02:56:16.660 --> 02:56:20.980]  But they said it. They've been doing it. They've been writing it. They've been preparing it.
[02:56:22.180 --> 02:56:27.380]  So if I say anti-fire a bunch of devil worshipers running around screaming hell Satan, I mean,
[02:56:27.380 --> 02:56:33.700]  that's what they do. I have video. So Alex is a bit dramatic. Well, I guess it is a bit dramatic.
[02:56:33.700 --> 02:56:40.500]  It's over the top dramatic. So retweet that from real Alex Jones, retweet that from Tony
[02:56:40.500 --> 02:56:47.460]  Shaper at T underscore spooky. Alex is a bit dramatic. Emergency Colonel Shaper confirms
[02:56:47.460 --> 02:56:55.300]  treasonous plan to assassinate Trump. He joins us to discuss the deep state's
[02:56:56.740 --> 02:57:01.380]  movements against the president and their plot to execute an assassination. They've been saying,
[02:57:01.380 --> 02:57:07.380]  quote, former CIA deputy director, we're preparing to kill him. The deep state's going to kill him.
[02:57:07.380 --> 02:57:14.740]  And then you've got COG saying continue government. We're going to remove him. We're going to have
[02:57:14.740 --> 02:57:19.460]  new elections. Democrat run Homeland Security will overthrow everybody else that was elected.
[02:57:19.460 --> 02:57:23.940]  And the Democratic Party will become a permanent one party state. They're the ones saying everyone
[02:57:23.940 --> 02:57:28.260]  that supports Trump's a Nazi. They're the ones calling for war. They're the ones saying go out
[02:57:28.260 --> 02:57:32.260]  and randomly kill cops. When cops get killed, they deserve to die because there's some bad cops.
[02:57:32.260 --> 02:57:38.820]  They're the ones saying it's racist to have a border. They're the globalist. They're the radicals.
[02:57:38.820 --> 02:57:43.620]  They're the ones that are over the top dramatic. And yes, extremism in defense of liberty is no
[02:57:43.620 --> 02:57:48.500]  vice. So I appreciate Colonel Shaper and I understand what he's saying because it is a bit
[02:57:48.500 --> 02:57:53.860]  dramatic, but he says I stand to buy it. So he's really good at you at judo there. He understands
[02:57:53.860 --> 02:57:58.980]  that he agrees with me, but he's not a bit dramatic, but I stand by it. Oh, look, this is really
[02:57:58.980 --> 02:58:03.140]  dramatic. This is really shocking. You need to look at it. So we're going to go to break,
[02:58:03.140 --> 02:58:07.380]  come back with your calls and other guests are coming in, but I'm telling you get that video.
[02:58:07.940 --> 02:58:13.140]  It's only got like 80,000 views or something. It was 60,000 an hour ago. It needs 10 million.
[02:58:13.780 --> 02:58:17.700]  It needs to be on Facebook and Twitter and your email list and talk show host
[02:58:17.700 --> 02:58:24.180]  need to be playing it. Forget what you think of Alex Jones. Just get the information out.

[02:59:58.660 --> 03:00:12.260]  war. It's Alex Jones, a poet's tale. A poet's tale how a poncho fell. He left his living in cheap hotels.
[03:00:13.380 --> 03:00:23.140]  The desert's quiet. Cleveland's cold. And so the story is, we're told. Poncho needs your prayers.
[03:00:23.140 --> 03:00:32.980]  It's true. But save a few for left here too. He only did what he had to do. There's Merle
[03:00:32.980 --> 03:00:44.740]  Haggard and now. And now he's growing old. Here's BBC. I got this on Paul's Twitter at
[03:00:44.740 --> 03:00:51.460]  Prison Planet because all over BBC programs now, they're going like Roman history, British history,
[03:00:51.460 --> 03:00:56.340]  you name it. Russian history and showing about a third of the people to have the people being
[03:00:56.340 --> 03:01:01.940]  black. I'm not against any black people, but don't show me a history about the Zulus or something.
[03:01:01.940 --> 03:01:10.020]  And then, you know, sit there and show me a bunch of white dudes, you know, in the Zulu tribe,
[03:01:10.020 --> 03:01:14.260]  or a show about Japanese. And you know, it's like a bunch of black guys or white guys. I mean,
[03:01:14.260 --> 03:01:18.340]  this is just mental illness. It shows Victorian England. There's like Asians,
[03:01:18.340 --> 03:01:24.820]  Black people everywhere. They're showing cartoons where the Romans are black.
[03:01:26.660 --> 03:01:35.780]  Hell, show Neil Armstrong, Chuck Yeager, make him black. I mean, it's like we can't have whites
[03:01:35.780 --> 03:01:42.100]  having any success because that's racist. It's mental illness. It's ridiculous.
[03:01:42.100 --> 03:01:48.340]  Yeah, make a movie about Aztec pyramid builders. Have some black dudes up there.
[03:01:50.740 --> 03:01:54.420]  It'd be like saying, don't show Obama as black. Show him as a white guy because you want to,
[03:01:54.420 --> 03:02:00.020]  it just, it's weird and it's getting worse. Josh and then Breda. Actually, Breda's been
[03:02:00.020 --> 03:02:03.380]  holding on to us. Breda, thanks for holding from Florida. You're on the air.
[03:02:03.380 --> 03:02:10.900]  Hey, Alex and all the info wars. Can you hear me? Yes, sir. I can.
[03:02:14.820 --> 03:02:23.700]  Thank God. Literally, I have waited and I've been, I'm a very patient man and I'm a man of God
[03:02:23.700 --> 03:02:31.380]  and I'm a man of Christ. And I believe that we can look at how Christ has handled
[03:02:31.380 --> 03:02:39.380]  in Chandy and people that have completely lost their mind when he says, you know,
[03:02:39.380 --> 03:02:44.020]  he says, come out of them, Satan, we are Legion and then the pigs all run off the edge of the cliff.
[03:02:45.620 --> 03:02:49.540]  Yeah, absolutely. I'm convinced if Christ went to an Antifa event and said,
[03:02:49.540 --> 03:02:52.180]  Legion out of them, they would all run screaming off the cliff.
[03:02:52.180 --> 03:03:01.540]  These people that, and we need to forget, honestly, we need to, we need to try to
[03:03:02.180 --> 03:03:08.980]  leave religion and the politics out of this. I think these people are really trying to look.
[03:03:08.980 --> 03:03:14.500]  And I'm talking about Antifa and all, they're all left. They're really, they're really seeking
[03:03:14.500 --> 03:03:25.140]  for answers. And the real answers is in the info war. I mean, it's proven fact that people,
[03:03:26.020 --> 03:03:33.060]  the truth hurts. But when Jesus went into the temples and kicked over the table, and I mean,
[03:03:33.060 --> 03:03:40.180]  it's all a story that aligns with what is happening now. And these people really,
[03:03:40.180 --> 03:03:46.820]  you know, as much as, you know, whatever left, right, it doesn't matter. Even in most of them
[03:03:46.820 --> 03:03:52.500]  are atheists and Zionists, you know, they believe that they're God and, and they're part of this
[03:03:52.500 --> 03:03:58.260]  huge big Godhead and, and all that. I'm telling you, these people are there. That's the point
[03:03:58.260 --> 03:04:05.460]  they're at. They just need the real information and, and they need to, you know, I'll tell this,
[03:04:05.460 --> 03:04:12.340]  I mean, I'll tell the globalists this, if they're looking for enlightenment, understanding, you
[03:04:12.340 --> 03:04:18.100]  know, the way of liberty is the way to go. What they're bringing in as authoritarian system is
[03:04:18.100 --> 03:04:23.620]  just a personal delusional power trip. That's a lie. And so I would, I would have to agree with
[03:04:23.620 --> 03:04:29.700]  you, Brett. Thank you, Josh, I'm going to ride shotgun. Let's bring in Olin shroyer right now
[03:04:29.700 --> 03:04:35.060]  to co-host with me with Jack the subject. My concern is he's going to be popping in and a lot
[03:04:35.060 --> 03:04:43.540]  more as we continue with your phone call straight ahead, 800-259-9231. We're now into hour number
[03:04:43.540 --> 03:05:10.260]  four. Stay with us. And by the way, Olin launches his new show next Wednesday, 3 p.m.
[03:05:13.620 --> 03:05:18.660]  But the right to keep and bear arms is not an outdated, dusty idea. Some old,
[03:05:18.660 --> 03:05:24.900]  dead white guys dreamed up in fear of the Redcoats. No, it is just as essential to liberty today as
[03:05:24.900 --> 03:05:31.220]  it was in 1776. The original amendments we refer to as the Bill of Rights contain 10 of what the
[03:05:31.220 --> 03:05:37.300]  constitutional framers termed unalienable rights. The Bill of Rights came to us with blinders on.
[03:05:37.300 --> 03:05:43.380]  It doesn't recognize color or class or wealth. It protects not just the rights of actors or editors
[03:05:43.380 --> 03:05:49.620]  or reporters, but extends even to those we love to hate. This is a small excerpt from Tralton Heston.

[03:07:48.180 --> 03:08:08.580]  Rallying Patriots Worldwide in Defense of Human Liberty. It's Alex Jones.
[03:08:08.580 --> 03:08:20.740]  All right Alex Jones here overlapping into the fourth hour which is always a great
[03:08:20.740 --> 03:08:24.180]  not even after show but just one of the latest is breaking with a whole
[03:08:24.180 --> 03:08:28.980]  roundtable discussion prototype. All the new broadcasts we're launching with David Knight
[03:08:28.980 --> 03:08:34.340]  now his first week complete and a great job two weeks now and that is of course weekday
[03:08:34.340 --> 03:08:39.700]  mornings 8 a.m. until I come on 11 a.m. central now starting next Wednesday we're going to kick
[03:08:39.700 --> 03:08:45.300]  off your inaugural transmission. Well and it's going to be a big roundtable discussion and very
[03:08:45.300 --> 03:08:50.980]  powerful 3 to 6 p.m. central and then just more is going to get at it. We've got a few more callers
[03:08:50.980 --> 03:08:57.380]  I'm going to hit. Jack Pasobic is here with us but a lot of good news is happening bad news for
[03:08:57.380 --> 03:09:02.340]  folks down at the hurricane gas shortages some some dead folks at the death tolls like 15 now
[03:09:02.340 --> 03:09:09.540]  but to see folks come together was really great it just flies in the face of the media at Hollywood
[03:09:09.540 --> 03:09:15.220]  and this total division they've been pushing to put all the minorities under their globalist control
[03:09:15.220 --> 03:09:20.180]  and then to submit whites to globalist control as well that's blowing up but
[03:09:21.220 --> 03:09:25.700]  Putin's come out and warns North Korea situation on the verge of large-scale conflict close quote
[03:09:26.340 --> 03:09:30.820]  that is really a big niche. Someone asked Jack Pasobic before we go these calls Anna and Shroyer
[03:09:30.820 --> 03:09:37.220]  as the wolf says in one of the good films the Quentin Tarantino's put out Pulp Fiction where I
[03:09:37.220 --> 03:09:42.260]  say good it's very entertaining you know when I think they've gotten home safe he says let's not
[03:09:42.260 --> 03:09:47.220]  start celebrating a little too much here he says a different way what should we be worried about
[03:09:47.220 --> 03:09:50.740]  right now because we're in the thick of battle every time it looks like we're going to lose things
[03:09:50.740 --> 03:09:57.460]  turn around gosh Hurricane Harvey we're sad it happened but God sent Owen what are you most concerned
[03:09:57.460 --> 03:10:02.260]  about it's funny that you mentioned that I actually think Alex that right now obviously the political
[03:10:02.260 --> 03:10:06.500]  left is getting more violent the FBI Department of Homeland Security starting to step in there
[03:10:06.500 --> 03:10:10.340]  the coup against President Trump that that we've been talking about you've been talked about since
[03:10:10.340 --> 03:10:15.380]  he was elected more people are pointing attention calling attention to that well we better they're
[03:10:15.380 --> 03:10:18.580]  on tv saying they're getting ready to do it but and then we're not supposed to be kooky and say
[03:10:18.580 --> 03:10:23.060]  they're saying it of course it's extreme and crazy they're saying it I'm not saying it they're saying
[03:10:23.060 --> 03:10:27.140]  it I gotta be honest with you though Alex with all of this madness going on I think the big
[03:10:27.140 --> 03:10:31.620]  story actually that's going to end up being here in the next two weeks I think Hurricane Irma
[03:10:31.620 --> 03:10:36.100]  is going to devastate America again you show the tracks most of them go across southern Florida
[03:10:36.100 --> 03:10:40.580]  right into the Gulf of the hot water and right into Louisiana or Texas again so there is a chance
[03:10:40.580 --> 03:10:45.700]  that Hurricane Irma can come up and hit the exact same spot that Hurricane Harvey hit now it could
[03:10:45.700 --> 03:10:51.460]  go up the east coast higher it could end up staying south but right now there is a chance and so
[03:10:51.460 --> 03:10:55.460]  with all this madness going on I think what we're going to see again just like we saw with Hurricane
[03:10:55.460 --> 03:11:01.380]  Harvey America's going to come together America's going to show its true colors all races all colors
[03:11:01.380 --> 03:11:05.460]  because remember what they did with Bush and he kind of let him manipulate him and then with
[03:11:05.460 --> 03:11:09.220]  Obama will just ignore the hurricanes because he didn't want unity that's why he wouldn't go do it
[03:11:09.220 --> 03:11:13.540]  but with Trump they just I mean with Bush they just attacked it and then the fed sabotaged it
[03:11:13.540 --> 03:11:16.820]  but then with Obama he just wouldn't even show up because he didn't want to have the unity
[03:11:16.820 --> 03:11:22.180]  and now we know they're so scared of the unity and it shows and you have the powerful images the
[03:11:22.180 --> 03:11:27.860]  powerful videos guys show Irma's track just just go to the national NOAA weather uh ocean
[03:11:27.860 --> 03:11:32.740]  Granville and and and then show possible tracks so that's where it currently is and where it's
[03:11:32.740 --> 03:11:39.060]  going to be uh but but let's show uh just search engine at NOAA it's possible tracks because all
[03:11:39.060 --> 03:11:42.820]  the there you go a lot of the tracks go up the east coast which we hope it does up into the
[03:11:42.820 --> 03:11:48.180]  middle of the north Atlantic but a lot of them go right into Florida right into south Carolina
[03:11:48.180 --> 03:11:52.500]  north Carolina georgia but a lot of the tracks have it going right into Mississippi Louisiana
[03:11:53.140 --> 03:11:58.820]  or possibly into texas again so so what happens you have leftist and trump haters complain
[03:11:58.820 --> 03:12:03.700]  donald trump didn't give enough money to hurricane harvey he donates a million dollar of his personal
[03:12:03.700 --> 03:12:08.580]  money to hurricane harvey and people go online on twitter and they complain oh why didn't he give
[03:12:08.580 --> 03:12:12.420]  more he could have gone more even though liberals are nine times more likely according to major
[03:12:12.420 --> 03:12:16.020]  canadian and red studies they don't get to not give money it's crazy the studies found the same
[03:12:16.020 --> 03:12:20.820]  numbers they give no money to harvey and then you have cnn who goes no no linda sorcerer gets the
[03:12:20.820 --> 03:12:27.140]  money and directs it to her her liberal groups that know no no none of it to aid i i can't even
[03:12:27.140 --> 03:12:31.860]  so you know what's worse than what's worse than big churches not open their doors well it's actually
[03:12:31.860 --> 03:12:35.380]  taking money and not giving it to them that's why i didn't even do aid stuff because i don't
[03:12:35.380 --> 03:12:38.740]  know how to get the money and then get it to the right group i don't even want to touch it has to
[03:12:38.740 --> 03:12:43.540]  be direct it the direct aid is usually the best to go but then yeah we sent trucks down we sent
[03:12:43.540 --> 03:12:48.100]  crew down yeah exactly and but then you listen so what is cnn do cnn goes out they stick a microphone
[03:12:48.100 --> 03:12:54.100]  in this woman who's hungry she's got her kid they're wet and what happens cnn gets completely rebuked
[03:12:54.100 --> 03:12:58.260]  this woman's like why do you have a camera in my face get that microphone she's in line freezing
[03:12:58.260 --> 03:13:02.980]  wanting food after days so so unfortunately alex even though we've got all of this madness all
[03:13:02.980 --> 03:13:07.060]  this political madness all this chaos the constant news cycle every day it's something we're trying
[03:13:07.060 --> 03:13:12.740]  to keep our finger on the pulse i think again god is going to remind us that that we are still ants
[03:13:12.740 --> 03:13:17.380]  on his planet well martin luther king exactly said just the universe bends towards justice
[03:13:17.380 --> 03:13:21.940]  jack bosovic uh the good the bad the ugly but but but since we have so much positive news
[03:13:21.940 --> 03:13:26.740]  we should probably look at where do you think the enemy is going to strike back well alex they're
[03:13:26.740 --> 03:13:33.060]  going to continue with this deep state stuff the comey is their end game they're going to have comey
[03:13:33.060 --> 03:13:39.460]  bring out some completely trumped up charges pun not intended but there you go on president trump
[03:13:39.460 --> 03:13:44.100]  they're going to use this to go after him they're going to be shaping our intelligence assessments
[03:13:44.100 --> 03:13:48.500]  and they're using that to filter the information that's getting to trump so that's why one of the
[03:13:48.500 --> 03:13:53.780]  big stories that i was breaking today on my uh blog that i put out is that there is a new group
[03:13:53.780 --> 03:13:59.460]  believe it or not of veterans of intelligence agents of law enforcement agents people that
[03:13:59.460 --> 03:14:04.260]  were essentially members of the deep state but these were white hats not black hats they were
[03:14:04.260 --> 03:14:09.220]  patriots that formed together that said we were going after our enemy we're going after the terrorist
[03:14:09.220 --> 03:14:14.580]  2015 the new york times reported the stuff 50 of them spoke forward and said obama is shaping and
[03:14:14.580 --> 03:14:20.100]  distorting the intelligence assessments on ices to make we already saw the real deep state five
[03:14:20.100 --> 03:14:24.740]  years ago refused to be al-qaeda ices's air force and make a deal with russia to take them out so
[03:14:24.740 --> 03:14:28.900]  when they say there's russian collusion the real collusion is with our military and the russians
[03:14:28.900 --> 03:14:35.620]  taken out radical jihadis exactly and so this new task force is stepping forward and saying
[03:14:35.620 --> 03:14:40.900]  enough is enough we see how you're trying to shape the assessments we see how you're trying
[03:14:40.900 --> 03:14:44.260]  to shape the information that's getting to president trump that's getting to these senior
[03:14:44.260 --> 03:14:47.780]  leaders and then trump goes and gives a speech and people are saying what's he talking about because
[03:14:47.780 --> 03:14:52.260]  he's not getting the real intel so they're working forward and i was i'm not able to give out any
[03:14:52.260 --> 03:14:56.420]  specific names just yet but in the coming weeks we're going to have more on this as they come
[03:14:56.420 --> 03:15:00.260]  forward and it's going to be whistleblowers they're going to be doing it in a legal way that involves
[03:15:00.260 --> 03:15:03.860]  attorney client privilege so they're not going to be giving away classified information but they're
[03:15:03.860 --> 03:15:08.260]  going to tell the truth about what's actually going on the battlefield and the fact that the
[03:15:08.260 --> 03:15:13.300]  senior leaders are not giving trump the information that he actually that's right they're trying to
[03:15:13.300 --> 03:15:18.260]  protect they're trying to still protect al-qaeda yeah this has been going on perfectly exemplary
[03:15:18.260 --> 03:15:22.500]  going all the way back to the clinton years when they were trying when they were trying to prop up
[03:15:22.500 --> 03:15:28.180]  al-qaeda and this goes back to the cia's original uh support for al-qaeda against the soviet unions
[03:15:28.180 --> 03:15:33.700]  in the 1970s and the early 1980s when they were in afghanistan the muja hadin the fact that cia and
[03:15:33.700 --> 03:15:39.060]  agency assets were fully behind that the fact that bin laden essentially was funded by the same
[03:15:39.060 --> 03:15:44.340]  organization now these are people that are patriots that are stepping forward and saying enough people
[03:15:44.340 --> 03:15:48.180]  like colonel schaefer who did it day one when they wouldn't let him kill him now schaefer was on
[03:15:48.180 --> 03:15:52.260]  the yesterday and he said look alex is being a bit dramatic but he stands by it they try to kill
[03:15:52.260 --> 03:15:56.900]  trump our enemies worldwide will move against us the deep state needs to think about that but most
[03:15:56.900 --> 03:16:01.700]  the deep state is just patriots is against what's happening people need to understand that but we'll
[03:16:01.700 --> 03:16:06.340]  put colonel schaefer's tweet up and where he retweeted where i said emergency colonel schaefer
[03:16:06.340 --> 03:16:11.140]  confirms treasonous plan to assassinate trump well he did agree on the video there's a plan hell
[03:16:11.140 --> 03:16:17.060]  they're on tv saying it i'm not the radical saying it it sounds radical when i report it but i'm
[03:16:17.060 --> 03:16:22.100]  simply reporting that reality is stranger than fiction jack so we've got to point out that
[03:16:22.100 --> 03:16:26.100]  they're trying to organize the coup in public as a confidence game what do you why do you think they're
[03:16:26.100 --> 03:16:33.700]  being so bold alex they're being so bold because they live in a bubble they live in an information
[03:16:33.700 --> 03:16:38.660]  bubble and this is actually something that we can use to our advantage because in their information

[03:21:12.980 --> 03:21:18.580]  trump and we also have to make sure that we're getting the information to him that he needs
[03:21:18.580 --> 03:21:24.340]  in every way possible by coming up here by sharing hashtags by sharing memes on social media social
[03:21:24.340 --> 03:21:29.140]  media is a two-way conversation with president trump he goes on there he goes on there is on
[03:21:29.140 --> 03:21:33.140]  his phone and they're checking on his phone when it when his phone calls they're trying to center
[03:21:33.140 --> 03:21:37.860]  the information that's been giving him but when he has the information when the president is giving
[03:21:37.860 --> 03:21:43.060]  the information uh of the actual facts of the situation he inevitably makes the right and they
[03:21:43.060 --> 03:21:49.460]  admit there is an informational you know the term has been used house arrest but i think informational
[03:21:49.460 --> 03:21:56.260]  coup against the president and an informational kidnapping has been taking place jack i would
[03:21:56.260 --> 03:22:01.620]  have been so shocked as to say when the events of charlotte's bill happened the deplorable
[03:22:01.620 --> 03:22:07.860]  horrible events of charlotte's bill happened trump was in trump tower he was able to investigate
[03:22:07.860 --> 03:22:12.580]  what was going on on his own had he been in the white house they would have given him lie after
[03:22:12.580 --> 03:22:19.460]  lie distorted everything and made him do exactly what they wanted him to do instead he had the full
[03:22:19.460 --> 03:22:24.580]  benefit of all the information that was out there on the table and was able to make his own decision
[03:22:24.580 --> 03:22:28.820]  into what he was going to say in the statement he was going to make and he's been proven and what
[03:22:28.820 --> 03:22:33.860]  two weeks later that he was a hundred percent correct in condemning both sides and now all
[03:22:33.860 --> 03:22:38.180]  of the media is suddenly admitting oh yeah antify his violent that's true they actually were violent

[03:26:03.780 --> 03:26:08.100]  going after him yeah how the word is he's actually an interdimensional spider that that chooses the
[03:26:08.100 --> 03:26:12.580]  form of that of the form of that clown to horrify children because it salts the meat would you
[03:26:12.580 --> 03:26:17.940]  smash menendez you know why clowns are associated with pedophilia and murder i already knew this
[03:26:17.940 --> 03:26:22.500]  but i did my research for about an hour this morning it's an all major anthropology that red
[03:26:22.500 --> 03:26:28.980]  nose right around the eyes white on the face was gods that you sacrifice children to and the
[03:26:28.980 --> 03:26:34.020]  ancients believed that those were demons they were giving children to and so arch typally
[03:26:34.020 --> 03:26:38.820]  whether you believe they were aliens or not it is like an alien that's come here that poses as a
[03:26:38.820 --> 03:26:46.420]  clown as a priest to kill children pretty crazy huh i'm not surprised but there's always i was in
[03:26:46.420 --> 03:26:50.820]  i was in bangor i was at steven king's house i was trying to go in there uh after he wrote the
[03:26:50.820 --> 03:26:55.060]  book he wrote it he's got the new movie coming out yeah it's got the resurgence now yeah trump
[03:26:55.060 --> 03:26:58.260]  blocked him on twitter so i went up there and i stood out front of his gate which he has of
[03:26:58.260 --> 03:27:02.180]  course a giant gate in front of steven king's house i can't have offense to him that's a loving
[03:27:02.180 --> 03:27:06.900]  gate but he's got the giant gate no it's it's a loving welcome okay steven king knows the plan
[03:27:07.620 --> 03:27:12.660]  the it the running man he knows what's going on how they're gonna use flu to kill everybody in a
[03:27:12.660 --> 03:27:17.300]  vaccine he knows but has decided to join it very evil person he wrote that in the 70s he wrote
[03:27:17.300 --> 03:27:22.500]  that in the 70s the stand he's an insider of this out there he's an insider out there and then they
[03:27:22.500 --> 03:27:26.660]  blocked him and he says he says he doesn't want trump to go see the new it movie he doesn't want
[03:27:26.660 --> 03:27:30.260]  to see any of this stuff because he's going against again again against trump but it's like
[03:27:30.260 --> 03:27:34.820]  wait a minute trump talks about the stuff that you wrote about he gets that stuff out there but
[03:27:34.820 --> 03:27:38.500]  you're just going to be unhinged against him because you don't like him craziness well i think
[03:27:38.500 --> 03:27:43.300]  the explanation for that is you've got on both sides of the aisle you've got people that have
[03:27:43.300 --> 03:27:47.940]  you know quote-unquote broken up taking the red pill so you have the the alex jones of the world
[03:27:47.940 --> 03:27:52.420]  who says i want to lift the people up i want to enlighten the people i'm going to dedicate my life
[03:27:52.420 --> 03:27:56.100]  to getting this information to people so that they can be empowered let me tell you something the other
[03:27:56.100 --> 03:27:59.860]  side of the aisle says when he wrote in this information i'm going to keep it to myself when
[03:27:59.860 --> 03:28:04.980]  he wrote it no one knew the devil works for his dress up and clown outfits and torture kids to
[03:28:04.980 --> 03:28:09.460]  release endorphins before they drink their blood no one knew that when he wrote it we've now confirmed
[03:28:09.460 --> 03:28:14.660]  the british royalty do it it's been in the british news he needs to be asked how did he know it i've
[03:28:14.660 --> 03:28:21.540]  been reading this stuff vampires all of it how does he know all that just saying uh listen i'm
[03:28:21.540 --> 03:28:24.900]  going to turn this over to you guys right now i want to take one more call that's been holding
[03:28:24.900 --> 03:28:29.860]  we'll go to uh elka and bill and others if you guys want to after but josh thanks for holding
[03:28:29.860 --> 03:28:38.900]  from organ you're on the air hello can you hear me just go ahead oh awesome hey uh so i've got a comment
[03:28:38.900 --> 03:28:44.340]  about uh the hurricane but real quick uh can i give you a little bit information about uh general
[03:28:44.340 --> 03:28:51.540]  kelly just go ahead okay so uh general kelly actually endorsed the critical infrastructure
[03:28:51.540 --> 03:28:58.660]  designation by uh j johnson uh it was only in one article that i saw and that was fdw the uh hold on
[03:28:58.660 --> 03:29:03.620]  hold over this is too big josh you've been holding critical infrastructure designation for the elections
[03:29:03.620 --> 03:29:07.620]  allowed them to federalize it deep state once trump was elected because they were planning an
[03:29:07.620 --> 03:29:11.220]  overthrow in a new emergency election this is what they do in third world countries we're gonna come
[03:29:11.220 --> 03:29:16.580]  back to josh i didn't know this give us the source during the break i believe you this is big breaking
[03:29:16.580 --> 03:29:22.180]  news because if that's the case it shows a real mold's gotten in because he's positioning the overthrow
[03:29:22.180 --> 03:29:28.900]  of the president uh and then and already endorsed the cog transfer which kelly will be acting president
[03:29:28.900 --> 03:29:33.620]  during that emergency just like alexander haig tried to do saying i'm now in charge i'm now in

[03:35:30.340 --> 03:35:37.140]  back to our caller josh do we have the story that he was talking about ready to go let's go back to
[03:35:37.140 --> 03:35:42.420]  josh and i'll have the crew pull up that story so josh what did you discover with this story and
[03:35:42.420 --> 03:35:49.060]  what do you think the angle is here that kelly was using well i know you know uh it trumped right
[03:35:49.060 --> 03:35:54.020]  now he's surrounded by mainly you know democrats and generals which is you know kind of unfortunate
[03:35:54.020 --> 03:35:58.580]  in some ways and we all know that nick masters uh you know deep state operatives basically but
[03:35:58.580 --> 03:36:03.700]  with kelly i've kind of been on the fence with him but i found this article uh from june 6
[03:36:03.700 --> 03:36:07.220]  and it was the only article i saw that even mentioned this but uh i'm just going to quote
[03:36:07.220 --> 03:36:12.100]  from the article here it says kelly told the home senate homeland security and governmental affairs
[03:36:12.100 --> 03:36:17.140]  committee on june 6 that despite pushback despite pushback he's received from state and local
[03:36:17.140 --> 03:36:22.340]  election officials as well as quote many members of congress he would support the designation
[03:36:22.340 --> 03:36:30.500]  put in place by predecessor j johnson so i thought that was pretty shocking when i read that well i'd
[03:36:30.500 --> 03:36:34.660]  like to read it for myself if we could have the crew pull it up here because i and we'll get
[03:36:34.660 --> 03:36:40.580]  poesobics take on this too because i mean it sounds to me like it's just a thing where general kelly
[03:36:40.580 --> 03:36:45.220]  is just kind of going along with what's already been there and he just decided not to take up
[03:36:45.220 --> 03:36:48.900]  this fight uh we'll try to get more information on this in fact if you guys could actually just
[03:36:48.900 --> 03:36:51.700]  print me this story uh jack what what's your first reaction to this
[03:36:54.500 --> 03:36:59.700]  sir i just going back to what i saw in terms of the original department home and security j johnson
[03:36:59.700 --> 03:37:05.460]  when he ruled on this is number one i agree with you uh so kelly did not spend enough time at the
[03:37:05.460 --> 03:37:10.420]  department to really dig into these issues to really get into what was going on so the first
[03:37:10.420 --> 03:37:14.580]  thing he did you know he was obviously making a lot of choices on southern border wall making a lot
[03:37:14.580 --> 03:37:19.220]  of decisions there that was the focus on border security on the south this other stuff that was
[03:37:19.220 --> 03:37:24.100]  going on he didn't really change what was happening in uh with department home and security policy
[03:37:24.100 --> 03:37:30.820]  but at the same time this ruling that johnson is putting out it lays the groundwork from a legal
[03:37:30.820 --> 03:37:36.900]  perspective for them to come in from the department of homeland security and essentially federalize
[03:37:36.900 --> 03:37:41.780]  our voting systems now the voting system back in 2012 you and i talked about this uh almost every
[03:37:41.780 --> 03:37:46.260]  day when i would come on the show we talked about how easy it is to manipulate these electronic
[03:37:46.260 --> 03:37:50.980]  voting machines right and now there's they're trying to take that vulnerability and turn it around
[03:37:50.980 --> 03:37:58.100]  and say oh no no no it's the russians who are attacking the machines based on like some blanket
[03:37:58.100 --> 03:38:03.380]  you know statement that somebody made somewhere and they could then federalize it well if you're
[03:38:03.380 --> 03:38:08.820]  federalizing this electronic voting process you and that opera opens up so many opportunities
[03:38:08.820 --> 03:38:13.860]  for uh disenfranchisement so many opportunities for just shenanigans that it takes the power away
[03:38:13.860 --> 03:38:18.580]  from the states to monitor their own elections yeah we need to be going the opposite direction
[03:38:18.580 --> 03:38:24.180]  with this the eu as socialists as the eu is they tried electronic voting and totally disawait did
[03:38:24.180 --> 03:38:28.100]  did away with it they went back to the paper ballast they said you know what there's too much
[03:38:28.100 --> 03:38:32.580]  at state here there's way too much to get rid of it it's ridiculous like you said i mean there's
[03:38:32.580 --> 03:38:37.300]  all these reports we've been talking about this it's it's simple it's obvious it's common sense
[03:38:37.300 --> 03:38:42.500]  yes this is an electronic machine it can be hacked and then you have all these hackers showing how
[03:38:42.500 --> 03:38:47.860]  they can do it all these different news corporations showing you how they can do it but i agree with i
[03:38:47.860 --> 03:38:51.380]  think we're both kind of at the same consensus here where it looks like kelly just chose not to
[03:38:51.380 --> 03:38:56.580]  fight this battle probably just left it there you we know what the department of homeland security's
[03:38:56.580 --> 03:38:59.780]  goal was to try to do with this thing we know what j johnson was trying to do with this thing
[03:38:59.780 --> 03:39:03.540]  and i'm not sitting here glorifying kelly or anything i don't like the fact that he's trying
[03:39:03.540 --> 03:39:07.620]  to control information getting to trump i'm just trying to call it as i see it but real quick and
[03:39:07.620 --> 03:39:11.140]  then i want to go back to josh with his thoughts on this and then we'll move on to other callers
[03:39:11.140 --> 03:39:18.260]  uh because he mentioned mcmaster and kelly i found it very interesting sebastian gorka
[03:39:18.260 --> 03:39:24.420]  who is no longer in trump's white house administration actually spoke highly of mcmaster
[03:39:25.060 --> 03:39:29.220]  just the other day in an interview with michael savage he in fact even said mcmaster was a
[03:39:29.220 --> 03:39:33.460]  patriot so i don't know if if he's just blowing smoke there but i i just wanted to point that out
[03:39:33.460 --> 03:39:37.140]  i thought i thought that that was interesting and then you also have to mention the fact that trump
[03:39:37.140 --> 03:39:43.860]  has been nothing but high praises of general kelly in fact i even think today trump tweeted again
[03:39:43.860 --> 03:39:48.020]  the high praises for general kelly so i i'm just i'm just putting that out there
[03:39:48.020 --> 03:39:51.780]  uh but let's go back to josh final comments josh so what do you think the angle here is
[03:39:51.780 --> 03:39:56.420]  what do you think about this story that you discovered uh well yeah i mean for sure you
[03:39:56.420 --> 03:40:00.180]  know you've got people you know playing uh you know with all the jokes about 40 chest
[03:40:00.180 --> 03:40:06.180]  stuff that's real though i mean that stuff goes on you know there's some serious um you know uh
[03:40:06.180 --> 03:40:10.660]  thinking that has to go on and people can't just uh you know broadcast what what they're
[03:40:10.660 --> 03:40:16.100]  planning on doing all the time um but definitely that's one quote that he said that definitely
[03:40:16.100 --> 03:40:20.580]  concerned me if you said uh quote we're here to help and it just reminded me of ronald reagan
[03:40:20.580 --> 03:40:26.740]  and his famous quote about uh the government when they're uh you know coming to help yeah the the
[03:40:26.740 --> 03:40:30.180]  three words you don't want to hear i'm from the government or whatever it is yeah here to help
[03:40:30.180 --> 03:40:35.460]  yeah yeah exactly all right i just think it's funny that oh sorry well no i i was gonna say
[03:40:35.460 --> 03:40:39.300]  thank you for the call i'm reading the story now and i could definitely see i mean when you actually
[03:40:39.300 --> 03:40:45.300]  read the story it is it is a lot more alarming than when you step back and try to try to look at it
[03:40:45.300 --> 03:40:51.060]  from a a farther perspective but again you got to understand sometimes i don't know about this chase
[03:40:51.060 --> 03:40:57.540]  gunter from fcw i'm not too familiar with him i don't know if jack is but you know there's there's
[03:40:57.540 --> 03:41:02.020]  when you write stories like this you can pick and choose words to try to paint a different picture
[03:41:02.020 --> 03:41:06.900]  than maybe entirely accurate so again i don't know if this is something that kelly is really fully
[03:41:06.900 --> 03:41:14.180]  behind as this interview kind of kind of eludes to or if if this is just an instance of kelly
[03:41:14.180 --> 03:41:19.860]  just kind of going along with it uh because as as said in the article it was supported by congress
[03:41:19.860 --> 03:41:24.900]  oh wow shocker the deep state congress and it was something that general johnson uh excuse me j
[03:41:24.900 --> 03:41:29.700]  johnson was already pushing for and so he just kind of said okay yeah we're just going to go along
[03:41:29.700 --> 03:41:35.380]  with it is that technically him doubling down as quoted in this article i don't know if that's fair
[03:41:35.380 --> 03:41:39.940]  to say uh what do you think jack you know what i wanted to comment what you said about how how
[03:41:39.940 --> 03:41:45.620]  the president essentially was was you know praising general kelly and gorka had had come out and said
[03:41:45.620 --> 03:41:49.940]  McMaster as a patriot and i would agree with them i would definitely agree that they are patriots
[03:41:49.940 --> 03:41:54.900]  and they are looking to serve their country however what people need to understand is under
[03:41:54.900 --> 03:42:02.020]  barack obama the general core and the admiral core of the of the army the marines and the navy
[03:42:02.020 --> 03:42:07.860]  it was uplifted the people were promoted through the war college system that only agreed with the
[03:42:07.860 --> 03:42:13.940]  obama agenda okay they were taught a certain perspective on how to look at the world and it
[03:42:13.940 --> 03:42:18.260]  was this it was the globalist perspective so when you were writing your dissertation at the war
[03:42:18.260 --> 03:42:22.340]  college when you were writing your papers you were doing your research it all had to include
[03:42:22.340 --> 03:42:28.580]  sort of those same buzzwords the climate change migration uh you know isis isn't really islamic
[03:42:28.580 --> 03:42:33.220]  all of these different um agreements that you had to go along with and that's how you raised got
[03:42:33.220 --> 03:42:38.260]  higher up and higher up in rank so to say that they're not patriots that wouldn't be true they're
[03:42:38.260 --> 03:42:44.740]  patriots but they view the world greatly differently they view america's role as being sort of like
[03:42:44.740 --> 03:42:52.340]  the spread arms wide blanket of security for the entire globe and everything that goes on in the
[03:42:52.340 --> 03:42:57.140]  world is the purview of the united states you know the world police when they're sort of like the
[03:42:57.140 --> 03:43:02.500]  the praise that a lot of people use uh satirically but that is kind of what it's like they view america's
[03:43:02.500 --> 03:43:08.580]  role as stabilization for asia specific for middle east for europe for russia for all of this and
[03:43:08.580 --> 03:43:13.860]  when anything goes wrong or anything changes in that system they then want to push back and get
[03:43:13.860 --> 03:43:18.660]  back to the system we have before and think that it's america's responsibility to do so right even
[03:43:18.660 --> 03:43:23.300]  if it doesn't directly affect american interests well and i was actually many people don't know
[03:43:23.300 --> 03:43:29.220]  this but the national anthem that we sing is only like 20 of the song it's only one it's only one
[03:43:29.220 --> 03:43:33.300]  verse of the song there's actually another verse in the song that says where there are enemies of
[03:43:33.300 --> 03:43:38.500]  freedom we feel it's our duty to to go there and to spread freedom to manifest freedom around the
[03:43:38.500 --> 03:43:42.100]  planet so maybe that's kind of what you're talking about i mean i'm not a war monger i'm not an
[03:43:42.100 --> 03:43:46.580]  expansionist i'm just just talking about history here i'll even throw you another red pill on the
[03:43:46.580 --> 03:43:51.620]  anthem uh if you want to if you go back even further one of the earlier drafts of that song
[03:43:52.180 --> 03:43:58.180]  that uh france got key had written actually was in response to the barberry pirates wars um you
[03:43:58.180 --> 03:44:02.260]  know the marines they talk about halls of montezuma to the shores of triply right the fighting in
[03:44:02.260 --> 03:44:07.380]  triply so one of the earlier drafts of the national anthem actually included lines about
[03:44:07.380 --> 03:44:12.180]  turbines and the crescent moon because that's where the barberry pirates were it was the Ottoman empire
[03:44:12.180 --> 03:44:16.900]  was muscled there you go a couple history uh red pills talking national anthem with jack
[03:44:16.900 --> 03:44:21.620]  pasoba i love it and i and i just want to say and then let's go to another caller here jack
[03:44:22.180 --> 03:44:27.140]  after reading the story i just completed it another thing crops into my head this is how
[03:44:27.140 --> 03:44:35.220]  my brain works so secretary kelly say i take brain force from info wars dot com so secretary kelly
[03:44:35.220 --> 03:44:41.300]  that the story says doubles down basically he i mean he supports it and he says yeah okay we're
[03:44:41.300 --> 03:44:45.620]  going to support this we want to consider this critical infrastructure we think this is the
[03:44:45.620 --> 03:44:50.660]  right thing to do and we're here to protect um voting basically so this is so funny to me
[03:44:51.940 --> 03:44:57.540]  if russia if russia hacked our election as the the narrative they'd like to put out there if russia
[03:44:57.540 --> 03:45:03.620]  was trying to infiltrate these these voting machines and all of this was going on well then why hasn't
[03:45:03.620 --> 03:45:07.540]  the department of homeland security made a statement why hasn't the department of homeland
[03:45:07.540 --> 03:45:12.500]  security that designated this critical infrastructure why haven't they done an investigation where's
[03:45:12.500 --> 03:45:17.780]  their reporting all we have to use are you trying to use reason and critical thinking to talk about
[03:45:17.780 --> 03:45:22.580]  what's going on the department of homeland security or oh and what is going on here you're right i i
[03:45:22.580 --> 03:45:27.620]  think i should just take debbie washman schultz word for it yeah don't don't you these aren't the
[03:45:27.620 --> 03:45:32.900]  servers you're looking for move along yeah yeah what what server that i'm beating with a hammer
[03:45:32.900 --> 03:45:37.700]  what are you talking about there's no server here don't worry about these blackberries don't worry
[03:45:37.700 --> 03:45:43.060]  about this leaf bit what what it aid that works for dozens of democrats and made millions of dollars
[03:45:43.060 --> 03:45:48.820]  that was trying to leave the country and send money to pakistan what it aid give me a break it was
[03:45:48.820 --> 03:45:56.340]  russia it was russia okay let's go there's no evidence whatsoever but clearly and we're not
[03:45:56.340 --> 03:46:01.860]  going to give you the evidence we don't have so shut up it was russia all right let's go to bill in
[03:46:01.860 --> 03:46:07.620]  wisconsin thank you for joining us bill hey oh and can you hear me loud and clear you guys hear me all
[03:46:07.620 --> 03:46:17.620]  right so uh it's good i love the uh video of the um instant karma for antifa when you got punched it
[03:46:17.620 --> 03:46:24.580]  was great um i'm just calling i'm the one who's getting punched in that video no i know that's
[03:46:24.580 --> 03:46:29.700]  what i'm saying i watch it thank you i appreciate it great um anyway i'm just calling to say that
[03:46:29.700 --> 03:46:36.020]  i think that the reason nancy polosi and when all those loony tunes uh paul ryan and everybody came
[03:46:36.020 --> 03:46:45.620]  out uh speaking again denouncing antifa is because they know that this violent overthrow of trump
[03:46:45.620 --> 03:46:51.460]  is coming and they're doing it to save faith yeah there's definitely an element of that no doubt
[03:46:52.020 --> 03:46:58.900]  and but regardless of what their motives are it again proves trump a hundred percent right
[03:46:58.900 --> 03:47:04.340]  and shows how it just shows how weak these people really are that that i think it really
[03:47:04.340 --> 03:47:08.340]  shows how weak they are more than anything and let's go down paul ryan for a second here jack
[03:47:09.220 --> 03:47:13.380]  paul ryan is now coming out and he thinks paul ryan thinks he's the president so
[03:47:13.380 --> 03:47:18.420]  he's gonna make the decisions on dakka he's gonna save dakka he's telling president trump we can
[03:47:18.420 --> 03:47:24.660]  we can fix dakka we can do something about this that's funny because years ago paul ryan was a
[03:47:24.660 --> 03:47:29.700]  guest on sean hannity and said that dakka was clearly unconstitutional and in fact attacked
[03:47:29.700 --> 03:47:37.860]  barack obama relentlessly on on dakka because it was unconstitutional this shows you how these people
[03:47:37.860 --> 03:47:45.780]  operate folks this look paul ryan is such a shill paul ryan is so shallow paul ryan is such a fraud
[03:47:45.780 --> 03:47:52.580]  that he's so dumb he doesn't even think wait a second in the past i said dakka was unconstitutional
[03:47:52.580 --> 03:47:57.540]  and i attacked it hardcore no he doesn't even think like that because he never had a real stance
[03:47:57.540 --> 03:48:02.500]  he never had a real stance if you had a real stance and you said that on sean hannity you would
[03:48:02.500 --> 03:48:06.980]  come out and you would say wait a second in the past i said this was unconstitutional i should
[03:48:06.980 --> 03:48:11.620]  stand by my guns there and if i'm gonna change my mind i should address why no he doesn't address
[03:48:11.620 --> 03:48:16.420]  any of that he doesn't bring into that up he just fights trump this is the true nature of these
[03:48:16.420 --> 03:48:20.740]  people jack they just do whatever is in the moment whatever they think is right whatever
[03:48:20.740 --> 03:48:25.860]  told is right no real no real thought no real critical thinking no real concern over the country
[03:48:25.860 --> 03:48:33.540]  just whatever sure oh i said that eight years ago oh oops i don't know paul ryan is the kind of guy
[03:48:33.540 --> 03:48:39.300]  oh and he goes around washington dc and everybody's seen this as he doesn't walk into a room where he
[03:48:39.300 --> 03:48:43.700]  doesn't think he's the smartest person and he's got his little briefcase and he opens up and pulls
[03:48:43.700 --> 03:48:49.220]  out these like uh these briefings that he's made with all of his wonderful quote unquote arguments
[03:48:49.220 --> 03:48:54.660]  that are handed to him by like kato institute and heritage foundation and he just he just reads it off
[03:48:54.660 --> 03:48:59.140]  and think and smiles that that little smile that we all see him with that little weasley smile
[03:48:59.140 --> 03:49:04.100]  and thinks i'm so smart because look at this or this i've made i'm so principled i'm so ideologically
[03:49:04.100 --> 03:49:08.980]  conservative quote unquote conservative and he's not actually thinking about the consequences of
[03:49:08.980 --> 03:49:13.460]  what he's doing and to your point yeah this wasn't like 10 years ago or something this was like
[03:49:13.460 --> 03:49:18.740]  three years ago maybe not even fully three years ago where he said no daca is unconstitutional
[03:49:18.740 --> 03:49:24.100]  so why not at least have the intellectual integrity to come out and say you know what i said it was
[03:49:24.100 --> 03:49:28.820]  unconstitutional then i stand by that statement well that's the thing he never he never even stood
[03:49:28.820 --> 03:49:32.900]  by his original statement and that's the point these people have no real statements of their own
[03:49:32.900 --> 03:49:39.700]  we're now joined again by alex jones absolutely on fire what's going on alex well no i know you
[03:49:39.700 --> 03:49:43.540]  got uh mike sternovich very busy shooting a film right now it's about to pop in so we're skipping
[03:49:43.540 --> 03:49:47.460]  this break so i'm only gonna spend a couple minutes on this thing at these latest updates from mike
[03:49:47.460 --> 03:49:53.140]  sternovich uh and of course jack the subject and yourself but i just wanted to point out your video
[03:49:53.140 --> 03:49:57.700]  you shot up the other day has 15 million views eight and a half million on one facebook four
[03:49:57.700 --> 03:50:02.740]  million on another we just counted it up it's like 15 almost 15 million views uh and it just shows
[03:50:02.740 --> 03:50:08.660]  it's not even an edited video it's just raw 20 minutes and we totaled up our videos in just the
[03:50:08.660 --> 03:50:14.260]  last week we've had 40 plus million views and this is despite all the censorship everything else
[03:50:14.260 --> 03:50:19.380]  that's going on i mean just liberty is on fire and there's another viral video that we did shoot
[03:50:19.380 --> 03:50:23.620]  that i meant to get to is when police states really do police state things i want to expose it
[03:50:23.620 --> 03:50:29.380]  and that is this latest thing out of salt lake city utah you talk about a real police state where
[03:50:29.380 --> 03:50:33.780]  the lady the nurse won't violate hippa federal law you can't take blood from somebody who do
[03:50:33.780 --> 03:50:41.220]  who refuses or who is incapacitated unconscious so they arrest her for not following orders
[03:50:41.220 --> 03:50:45.860]  this is a bad cop this is a police state so i just wanted to put on screen it's now eight million
[03:50:45.860 --> 03:50:49.940]  views sorry i guess it's going up since i looked at it five minutes ago 15 million views total
[03:50:49.940 --> 03:50:54.180]  on a video you uploaded a day and a half ago i mean it's just it's not just this it's everything
[03:50:54.180 --> 03:51:01.300]  we're doing is on fire psobex on fire uh sternovich is on fire i mean it's just in fuego baby in
[03:51:01.300 --> 03:51:06.340]  fuego but then i saw this viral video this morning and i meant to get to it so let's play this and
[03:51:06.340 --> 03:51:11.380]  then get my sternovich's take on that and everybody also have comments but here's the video nurse
[03:51:11.380 --> 03:51:16.340]  forcibly arrested for not allowing cop to draw blood of unconscious patient salt lake city tribune
[03:51:16.340 --> 03:51:25.300]  here it is so i have this it says a painting blood sample for police enforcement from patients
[03:51:25.300 --> 03:51:32.180]  suspected to be under the influence okay this is something that you guys agreed to with this hospital
[03:51:32.180 --> 03:51:37.300]  the three things that allow us to do that are if you have an electronic warrant patient consent
[03:51:37.300 --> 03:51:43.860]  or patient under arrest and neither of those things the patient can't consent he told me
[03:51:43.860 --> 03:51:49.540]  repeatedly that he doesn't have a warrant and the patient is not under arrest how dare she know
[03:51:49.540 --> 03:51:58.580]  the law that's the real offense here that's all so okay so i take it without those in place i'm not
[03:51:58.580 --> 03:52:03.380]  going to do what the hospital's agreement with the cops am i fair to summarize that
[03:52:09.620 --> 03:52:14.900]  her boss is telling her don't do it oh another another thought criminal i have no idea why he's
[03:52:14.900 --> 03:52:21.460]  blaming me i'm just representing why are you blaming the best she's the one that has told me no
[03:52:21.460 --> 03:52:30.740]  you're making a huge mistake right now you're making a huge mistake let's hear this okay no
[03:52:30.740 --> 03:52:39.700]  we're done we're done you're under arrest we're done he thinks her fall in the law is illegal
[03:52:39.700 --> 03:52:45.940]  but that's a bad cop now where's antifa on this where are all the protests on this what the hell
[03:52:45.940 --> 03:52:50.580]  is this cop's problem and some people say oh because it's a white lady you're upset i don't
[03:52:50.580 --> 03:52:56.180]  care she's black what she is this is crazy i have bad administration on the way i mean they have to
[03:52:56.180 --> 03:53:01.620]  follow federal and state law i mean why would do why would you even treat the woman like this
[03:53:01.620 --> 03:53:05.780]  you know i mean this is just it's just the tactics are absurd well uh mike sternum it's
[03:53:05.780 --> 03:53:11.620]  what do you make of this insanity yeah i mean this has been happening for the militarization
[03:53:11.620 --> 03:53:18.340]  of police this has been happening for years and of course you know where's antifa where are the
[03:53:18.340 --> 03:53:22.100]  rights activists and civil libertarians and everything they don't really care because
[03:53:22.900 --> 03:53:28.340]  they are pardoned parcel to all of this i'm not surprised i mean we you know there's this has
[03:53:28.340 --> 03:53:32.740]  been going on for you know years and years just like the cops standing down when they follow orders
[03:53:32.740 --> 03:53:37.220]  to let antifa beat people up then folks will say oh thought you're kissing the cops but you know we
[03:53:37.220 --> 03:53:40.740]  don't want to randomly kill cops have done nothing like black lives matter but you also
[03:53:40.740 --> 03:53:47.460]  don't support cops thinking they're god uh mike well and for years we've covered police misconduct
[03:53:47.460 --> 03:53:52.980]  including you know shooting dogs they'll go into the wrong house and they'll shoot your dog or
[03:53:52.980 --> 03:53:58.500]  maybe they've shot dogs that are just behind defense by their own business there is a problem in
[03:53:58.500 --> 03:54:04.260]  america with tyranny there's always a new problem in america with tyranny and most cops are great
[03:54:04.260 --> 03:54:09.620]  but cops like that that guy that is false arresting kidnapping that cops belong to prison i mean he
[03:54:09.620 --> 03:54:13.460]  should be arrested immediately and sent to prison there should be and you hear the hospital
[03:54:13.460 --> 03:54:21.540]  administrator saying officer you're making a big mistake yeah exactly and it sounded like he just
[03:54:21.540 --> 03:54:27.460]  snapped he's uncut for the uniform he needs to go to prison man he there's no question what he did
[03:54:27.460 --> 03:54:32.580]  there if you or i or anybody else had done that we would have prison for kidnapping and that is
[03:54:32.580 --> 03:54:36.980]  what he did because he had no lawful authority to do that he definitely belongs to the president
[03:54:36.980 --> 03:54:41.460]  i think the real danger here alex is that and this is this is the real police state problem
[03:54:41.460 --> 03:54:46.820]  that i think we would all agree with where they put the whole entire police thing over the constitution
[03:54:46.820 --> 03:54:52.260]  and these cops say okay it's more important for us to build our case against this suspected guy who
[03:54:52.260 --> 03:54:57.700]  i guess they pulled over dui or whatever it's more important for us to break the law get this sample
[03:54:57.700 --> 03:55:02.740]  so that we can have our case then it is to actually follow the law obey the constitution and treat
[03:55:02.740 --> 03:55:06.500]  that woman with dignity well it's a much bigger violation for him to violate the big general
[03:55:06.500 --> 03:55:11.620]  fourth amendment but then we're all screwed whereas now we got Mueller going after trump and all this
[03:55:11.620 --> 03:55:14.740]  and where are all the lawyers where are all the good lawyers out there we're all the liberal
[03:55:14.740 --> 03:55:19.060]  lawyers well the difference is that's why it's bad to have a anti-farm black lives matter randomly
[03:55:19.060 --> 03:55:23.700]  shooting cops in the back because then it makes any real criticism of cops look like them it's
[03:55:23.700 --> 03:55:33.220]  it's a real polarization mike sternovich that's why i believe that black lives matter was designed
[03:55:33.220 --> 03:55:38.340]  to bring us to a police state because for years and years and years all of us have criticized
[03:55:38.340 --> 03:55:42.740]  about policemen's conduct when it does happen but then black lives matter they come in and they
[03:55:42.740 --> 03:55:47.140]  murder police and then that makes it so that we don't even want to criticize any police officer
[03:55:47.140 --> 03:55:50.100]  anymore because then we'll think wait you're you're gonna loop us in with the terrorists
[03:55:50.100 --> 03:55:53.220]  black lives matter because communists are trying to overthrow the government starting with the
[03:55:53.220 --> 03:55:58.260]  police exactly now now i appreciate you popping in and i'll eat you back up on soon i know you're
[03:55:58.260 --> 03:56:02.100]  making a film right now but but mike other tidbits any breaking news since yesterday
[03:56:02.100 --> 03:56:08.820]  you know jack had that great story about how there are a bunch of patriot veterans who are

[03:56:25.300 --> 03:56:31.540]  think tanko a war room so to speak online where they're going to try to figure out ways to come
[03:56:31.540 --> 03:56:36.660]  back the deep state coup going on right now and that's for you jack that's your story of course
[03:56:38.740 --> 03:56:42.100]  yeah i know mike i appreciate that and it's great because i know you've been you and i've
[03:56:42.100 --> 03:56:47.460]  been talking to some of the same people here in dc uh this actually goes up to a lot higher levels
[03:56:47.460 --> 03:56:52.740]  of people that uh were previously in the administration up until very recently if that
[03:56:52.740 --> 03:56:58.260]  kind of gives a few clues out there um a lot of this could come publicly very very soon but i was
[03:56:58.260 --> 03:57:03.620]  given the approval to bring it out today to write it up they knew i was going to come on the show
[03:57:03.620 --> 03:57:07.460]  today alex and i wanted to get it out to the info wars audience to let people know and i can even
[03:57:07.460 --> 03:57:13.140]  just say in the hour since i first mentioned this i've had probably over a hundred messages
[03:57:13.140 --> 03:57:17.780]  through twitter and email saying hey i want to be part of this i i see the exact same thing that's
[03:57:17.780 --> 03:57:26.020]  going on i'm a patriot you're a hundred percent right how can i help all right jack i don't know
[03:57:26.020 --> 03:57:30.420]  if uh we still have cernovich on with us or not um but i was waiting for his response we're in the
[03:57:30.420 --> 03:57:36.500]  final minutes of the show here go ahead go ahead mike good no definitely uh people there's there's
[03:57:36.500 --> 03:57:43.220]  an active underground community of patrons in the mirror who do you want to fight back and do you
[03:57:43.220 --> 03:57:47.460]  want to fight these things there's also going to be a lot of stuff going on in the true elections
[03:57:47.460 --> 03:57:52.900]  i mean in fact you know i can't go into too much detail for obstec but i mean i personally have been
[03:57:52.900 --> 03:58:00.740]  in um in discussions with special operations veterans on ways to employ totally legal and
[03:58:00.740 --> 03:58:09.060]  lawful protest techniques um for activism well there's no doubt that the globalist want to
[03:58:09.060 --> 03:58:13.300]  bring in a poli state we've been calling that out for years and and mike cernovich is probably onto
[03:58:13.300 --> 03:58:19.780]  something using blm using antifa using all this domestic violence to get the patriots that make
[03:58:19.780 --> 03:58:24.020]  the difference in this country to actually get behind it thanks jack bosovic thanks mike cernovich
