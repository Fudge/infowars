[00:11.520 --> 00:19.080]  so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin
[00:19.080 --> 00:39.000]  Texas Alex Jones welcome my friends welcome it is Thursday the 12th day of
[00:39.000 --> 00:46.800]  May 2011 and we're gonna be here for at least the next three hours live Dr. Steve
[00:46.800 --> 00:52.720]  Pachinick of course first joined us last Tuesday after a nine and a half year
[00:52.720 --> 00:58.400]  respite from not being on this broadcast he is the co-author of many of
[00:58.400 --> 01:04.440]  Tom Clancy's books also one of the co-producers of several of the big films
[01:04.440 --> 01:13.000]  you of course have seen released via the theater the whole Patriot Games series
[01:13.000 --> 01:18.760]  he is a psychiatrist he also has another medical degree on record he wrote the
[01:18.760 --> 01:23.680]  psychological warfare manual for the State Department and the London Guardian
[01:23.680 --> 01:29.100]  Associated Press and others report that he ran assassination squads also carried
[01:29.100 --> 01:34.280]  out assassinations himself and the London Telegraph reports in the Italian
[01:34.280 --> 01:39.040]  government confirms that he was instrumental in ensuring that the
[01:39.040 --> 01:43.240]  Italian Prime Minister was not released by the Red Brigades putting out the news
[01:43.240 --> 01:47.400]  reportedly that the Italian Prime Minister had already been killed by them
[01:47.400 --> 01:52.240]  giving them no choice but to kill him I mean that's psychological warfare a very
[01:52.240 --> 01:58.120]  very high-powered individual also of course breaking down here that Ben
[01:58.120 --> 02:06.000]  Laden was dying of Marfan's and total kidney failure sometime right after 9
[02:06.000 --> 02:10.040]  11 and then we saw a lot of other high-powered people come out and say
[02:10.040 --> 02:14.560]  the same thing Bob Barrow the CIA Madeleine Albright former Secretary of
[02:14.560 --> 02:22.200]  State Teresa Heinz-Kerry Walter Cronkite after we talked to Pachennik and then I
[02:22.200 --> 02:25.880]  of course broke the news of two other White House sources inside the Bush
[02:25.880 --> 02:30.040]  administration that they were planning to roll him out now the former Chief
[02:30.040 --> 02:33.680]  Deputy of Secretary of State Colin Powell has come out on national TV last
[02:33.680 --> 02:38.600]  night and said that Bush didn't want Bin Laden dead that is he didn't want the
[02:38.600 --> 02:46.040]  myth of Bin Laden dead as a reason to continue the wars and people kept asking
[02:46.040 --> 02:50.160]  me well why wouldn't Bush roll out the dead body if he had it well they were
[02:50.160 --> 02:53.320]  thinking about it in 2004 election if they needed it but his margin of
[02:53.320 --> 02:56.600]  victory was wide enough to not do that plus they stole a few key states and
[02:56.600 --> 03:02.160]  then the fix was already in because his cousin and skull and bones buddy Kerry
[03:02.160 --> 03:06.760]  didn't challenge it but they were ready to roll it out but Democrats came out
[03:06.760 --> 03:12.160]  and cried foul so they didn't and that was part of the larger plan they were
[03:12.160 --> 03:15.880]  able to go along with their original plan to continue to use him as this boogie
[03:15.880 --> 03:22.360]  this devilish bogey flapping around in the night like a winged devil that we
[03:22.360 --> 03:25.880]  could be ministered into giving up our liberty and completely overturning our
[03:25.880 --> 03:30.480]  once free societies in Western Europe and here in the United States and
[03:30.480 --> 03:38.840]  Canada Australia New Zealand now since that information has come out there's
[03:38.840 --> 03:46.960]  been a big hit piece MSNBC TV and we have the text of that report new life
[03:46.960 --> 03:54.880]  for an old rumor was Bin Laden a Marfa Noid and a Marfa Noid I guess is the
[03:54.880 --> 04:02.200]  term they made up for someone that has the syndrome and they call up some of
[04:02.200 --> 04:08.120]  the heads of major universities top doctors experts on this syndrome who
[04:08.120 --> 04:13.640]  had been on record back around 9-11 saying this guy's a Marfa Noid to use
[04:13.640 --> 04:17.640]  that term they're using and they can only live a few years at that advanced
[04:17.640 --> 04:23.040]  stage on top of full renal failure that's why Pachinac who met Bin Laden
[04:23.040 --> 04:29.040]  even back in the 1980s said the guy had trouble walking and looked very sick but
[04:29.040 --> 04:34.200]  hey he's back I mean you know ten years later hanging out watching TV in a house
[04:34.200 --> 04:42.400]  in a house without dialysis equipment living in what looks like a house that
[04:42.400 --> 04:46.720]  homeless people were squatting in a crack house and inside the house with Bin
[04:46.720 --> 04:58.600]  Laden again we're the Easter Bunny unicorns, minotaurs, cablers, pixies
[05:00.880 --> 05:05.760]  hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone this
[05:05.760 --> 05:10.360]  is our last chance to not relive history as we're finishing off this agenda
[05:10.360 --> 05:14.320]  that we're pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home I've
[05:14.320 --> 05:18.760]  turned a tremendous influence on our president in Congress and they really
[05:18.760 --> 05:23.560]  are calling the shots I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American
[05:23.560 --> 05:27.920]  citizens to pay attention for the Republic identifies the enemies of our
[05:27.920 --> 05:33.200]  nation the criminal offshore cartel held bent on destroying sovereignty and on
[05:33.200 --> 05:37.520]  its ashes constructing world government Tim Geithner Bernanke the arsonists
[05:37.520 --> 05:41.000]  they're asking for more matches and the Congress is saying who do we make the
[05:41.000 --> 05:46.240]  check out to today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we
[05:46.240 --> 05:51.920]  have seen a fall of the Republic get your copy of full of the Republic on DVD

[06:02.440 --> 06:06.720]  consider buying a solar power generator number one new climate legislation
[06:06.720 --> 06:10.920]  could easily double or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are
[06:10.920 --> 06:14.800]  wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have it's
[06:14.800 --> 06:18.800]  true total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid
[06:18.800 --> 06:23.360]  technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is
[06:23.360 --> 06:28.000]  dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding
[06:28.000 --> 06:31.760]  the problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids
[06:31.760 --> 06:35.200]  every year thousands of families lose their power from weather related
[06:35.200 --> 06:39.120]  damages number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup
[06:39.120 --> 06:42.280]  insurance and peace of mind folks I really believe in the solar power

[08:08.560 --> 08:25.200]  Alex Jones and the GCN radio network
[08:25.200 --> 08:34.000]  ladies and gentlemen it is Thursday the 12th day of May 2011 dr. Steve
[08:34.000 --> 08:39.040]  Pachennick is going to be joining us coming up in the second and third hour
[08:39.040 --> 08:44.400]  today we're gonna open phones in the third hour for dr. Pachennick for your
[08:44.400 --> 08:49.960]  questions or comments for him he hasn't been on with us since last Friday he's
[08:49.960 --> 08:54.840]  since been on coast to coast AM there have been scores of newspaper articles
[08:54.840 --> 08:58.960]  all over the world and here in the United States written about the interviews
[08:58.960 --> 09:03.560]  that dr. Steve Pachennick of course co-author of some of Tom Clancy's books
[09:03.560 --> 09:08.880]  co-producer of some of the films state department psychiatrist who wrote their
[09:08.880 --> 09:13.520]  book on modern psychological warfare also carrying out overthrow of foreign
[09:13.520 --> 09:19.160]  governments on record and assassinations both running assassination teams and of
[09:19.160 --> 09:24.560]  course being an assassin in his own right the very interesting person after
[09:24.560 --> 09:29.920]  this bin Laden hoax blows over and the fight is still intensifying I want to
[09:29.920 --> 09:34.800]  have him back in the future just to talk about his interesting life at least as
[09:34.800 --> 09:38.400]  much of it as he can talk about he can only talk about what's been leaked into
[09:38.400 --> 09:45.840]  mainstream media over the years but he is a very authoritative source for us and
[09:45.840 --> 09:54.400]  and what he said nine plus years ago on this broadcast April 22nd 2002 was backed
[09:54.400 --> 09:57.800]  up by subsequent statements of the Secretary of State former Secretary of
[09:57.800 --> 10:01.960]  State Marilyn Albright big insider Walter Cronkite Theresa Hines carry and
[10:01.960 --> 10:06.600]  others that the body's been frozen on ice ready to be rolled out died of natural
[10:06.600 --> 10:13.840]  causes sometime in right after 9-11 in December is the best date they've got a
[10:13.840 --> 10:19.400]  few months before 9-11 it's on record CBS News LaFigaro in France to Spiegel in
[10:19.400 --> 10:27.760]  Germany but the CIA visited him at the American Hospital in Dubai and that
[10:27.760 --> 10:31.480]  he met with them he's also being treated by American doctors for Marfan's and
[10:31.480 --> 10:38.520]  total kidney failure and long-term British MI6 family the bin Laden's are
[10:38.520 --> 10:41.720]  the richest construction family in the Middle East worth tens of billions of
[10:41.720 --> 10:46.240]  dollars and that they were had their contracts roughly doubled in the three
[10:46.240 --> 10:50.080]  years after 9-11 for playing along with the whole game your son's been a great
[10:50.080 --> 10:56.680]  servant great CIA asset against the Russians of course the African country
[10:56.680 --> 11:02.520]  Sudan had him wanted to turn him over in 1996 that handover was refused Clinton
[11:02.520 --> 11:06.200]  didn't want him they're using al-Qaeda to attack Qaddafi's forces that's
[11:06.200 --> 11:10.960]  admitted I mean this is all hiding in plain view Adam Gadahn grandson of the
[11:10.960 --> 11:14.840]  head of the ADL arrested for beating up people outside Mosque his real way to get
[11:14.840 --> 11:18.920]  Muslims and Arabs is then go dress up like them and run around saying I'm a
[11:18.920 --> 11:23.480]  terrorist bomb the Arabs I mean it's just classic frame up you've got Amar
[11:23.480 --> 11:28.280]  Alaki admitted CIA hanging out secretly at the Pentagon continually Fox News AP
[11:28.280 --> 11:35.120]  so you've got all that background but in a article in MSNBC from a few days
[11:35.120 --> 11:42.200]  ago new life for an old rumor was bin Laden a Marfanoi and that's the name of
[11:42.200 --> 11:46.200]  someone who has this Marfan syndrome and they went and talked all these top
[11:46.200 --> 11:50.280]  medical heads and university heads at one of the big medical centers where
[11:50.280 --> 11:57.880]  Picinic was trained as well and they they said yeah he had Marfan syndrome it
[11:57.880 --> 12:02.120]  was in the advanced late stages and he had kidney failure and there's no way
[12:02.120 --> 12:08.360]  he'd be alive I mean it's this guy could hardly walk in 2001 according to
[12:08.360 --> 12:13.640]  witnesses he was hanging out under US care and I'll never forget Bandar Bush
[12:13.640 --> 12:17.880]  and Larry King live a few weeks after 9-11 and Larry King says bin Laden
[12:17.880 --> 12:21.240]  somebody ought to dig this up I know listeners could do it just Bandar Bush
[12:21.240 --> 12:25.120]  that's his nickname Prince Bandar or the House of Saud you want his full name
[12:25.120 --> 12:31.320]  Bandar Saud was on Larry King live and then he goes what do you say about this
[12:31.320 --> 12:36.480]  coward bin Laden he goes do not call him a coward he is a great warrior of great
[12:36.480 --> 12:44.640]  honor and this was the Saudi Arabian ambassador the US and Larry King live
[12:44.640 --> 12:51.280]  said okay man of great honor basically because see the the the dual operation
[12:51.280 --> 12:56.240]  was he was this hero to the Middle East this hero to Arabs and Muslims at least
[12:56.240 --> 13:01.080]  the West was pushing him as that Saudi Arabia which is the birthplace of
[13:01.080 --> 13:10.080]  Islam has roughly in 79% of Islamic faithful are the form of Islam that
[13:10.080 --> 13:16.720]  comes out of Saudi Arabia another 20% are Shiite and and and they hate each
[13:16.720 --> 13:21.000]  other worse than they dislike you know other regions and religions and groups
[13:21.000 --> 13:24.080]  and this is just plain old tribalism they're absolutely at each other's
[13:24.080 --> 13:30.600]  throats Saudi Arabia is the third largest recipient of military aid to from
[13:30.600 --> 13:36.560]  the US in the world and it's just a complete joke and so the strategic plan
[13:36.560 --> 13:43.840]  was to fire up and and create Islamic resistance movements worldwide that
[13:43.840 --> 13:49.200]  could then be turned against the secular Arab governments to overthrow them this
[13:49.200 --> 13:55.200]  was a replay of 1953 Muhammad Mosaddek Operation Ajax they use the Muslim
[13:55.200 --> 14:00.000]  extremist to overthrow the government then they double-crossed them put the
[14:00.000 --> 14:04.160]  Shaw in and then he started the mass arrest of those folks then when the Shaw
[14:04.160 --> 14:12.320]  wasn't being pliant they brought in the same exiled sons of the group they'd
[14:12.320 --> 14:19.480]  worked with in 53 out of France to overthrow the Shaw but then the the
[14:19.480 --> 14:24.560]  the Islamic Revolution double-crossed the CIA and took over the country for
[14:24.560 --> 14:30.040]  themselves they said you double-crossed us in 53 they play along I had told a
[14:30.040 --> 14:34.840]  Humani Humani and and that's all on record but but they were still big
[14:34.840 --> 14:38.920]  enough buddies with the West to say give us the tow missiles give us the
[14:38.920 --> 14:45.200]  rockets give us the weapons give us the money and the gold and then we'll give
[14:45.200 --> 14:50.400]  you the money back and our weapons that can't be traced to be sold to the
[14:50.400 --> 14:55.240]  guerrillas in Central and South America and that of course is the whole Iran
[14:55.240 --> 15:01.960]  Contra situation and it just goes on and on and on from that point and this all
[15:01.960 --> 15:08.280]  came out in congressional hearings so this is all a bunch of double dealing
[15:08.280 --> 15:15.320]  manipulation that's the overview of what's happening and so the CIA goes to
[15:15.320 --> 15:19.200]  bin Laden they say you've done a super job your family's gonna be well taken
[15:19.200 --> 15:23.680]  care of we know you're here on your deathbed we're gonna do a big event and
[15:23.680 --> 15:27.640]  blaming on you and we just want to get that straight with your family everybody
[15:27.640 --> 15:30.520]  and the agreement was made absolutely you're gonna double our contracts from
[15:30.520 --> 15:34.280]  a billion a year to two three billion absolutely and then they got all the
[15:34.280 --> 15:38.760]  contracts to build all those new bases they built a lot of the new ones in Iraq
[15:38.760 --> 15:42.120]  but all the new ones in Saudi Arabia and other areas they're the folks that air
[15:42.120 --> 15:45.720]  conditioned Mecca decades ago in a multi-million dollar contract outdoor
[15:45.720 --> 15:50.600]  air conditioning at Mecca and they've just done a fabulous jobs they're
[15:50.600 --> 15:54.880]  a fabulous Al Qaeda job against the Serbs Serbs fight back NATO goes in and
[15:54.880 --> 15:59.320]  blows the daylights out of them they have Al Qaeda attack Gaddafi Gaddafi fights
[15:59.320 --> 16:04.440]  back the West goes into backup Al Qaeda same thing with the Russians in the 80s
[16:04.440 --> 16:09.600]  I mean Al Qaeda is a dear loved trusted carefully crafted created
[16:09.600 --> 16:14.360]  organization but at another level then they have the Al Qaeda Patsy's where they
[16:14.360 --> 16:17.720]  can hype them up in the Middle East and get other people to join them and then
[16:17.720 --> 16:20.880]  use them against governments like Gaddafi use them against governments like
[16:20.880 --> 16:25.560]  Saddam they know our population so dumb down with terms and the players it's like
[16:25.560 --> 16:32.080]  telling you the Dallas Cowboys are the San Diego Chargers it is just just just
[16:32.080 --> 16:36.120]  no connection to reality that they tell you Saddam's with Al Qaeda he launched
[16:36.120 --> 16:40.760]  the attacks bin Laden's in Iraq here's the derelict beached aircraft that
[16:40.760 --> 16:44.880]  they're training in and then they get there and it's not true and mobile
[16:44.880 --> 16:49.840]  weapons labs anthrax attacks they blamed on Saddam I mean it's just all lies we've
[16:49.840 --> 16:58.120]  got a new video out that's up on info wars.com that is the total proof the
[16:58.120 --> 17:03.440]  total 15 minute boil down proof that this entire bin Laden situation is a
[17:03.440 --> 17:09.880]  manifest fraud and hoax and the reason this is so important and the reason we've
[17:09.880 --> 17:15.400]  been spending so much time on this hoax is you see the 13-point bounce for Obama
[17:15.400 --> 17:20.040]  and now with that political capital he wants the total TSA takeover of all
[17:20.040 --> 17:25.720]  society and we got the new bill from Chuck E. Schumer today to quote federalized
[17:25.720 --> 17:29.600]  local police to make them the goon force at all the train stations bus
[17:29.600 --> 17:34.120]  stations and highways now how did I know that was coming I saw Governor Ridge
[17:34.120 --> 17:38.160]  almost nine years ago talk about it in two-hour speech but then I also saw the

[24:12.120 --> 24:19.480]  about the article upon prison planet calm intellectual lobotomy of America
[24:19.480 --> 24:26.360]  mother injects eight-year-old with Botox and these mothers address their five
[24:26.360 --> 24:31.280]  six-year-old girls up like whores and high heels and short miniskirts and paint
[24:31.280 --> 24:37.440]  them up with war paint then they inject them so they don't get wrinkles you see
[24:37.440 --> 24:41.560]  people don't value liberty and freedom and family and what's valuable the
[24:41.560 --> 24:46.320]  globalist force feed us cultural death so when I say land of the slaves home of
[24:46.320 --> 24:55.600]  the cowards I'm talking about that 50% or so that believes all the propaganda that
[24:55.600 --> 25:00.480]  like the nanny state I'm talking about the close to 50% of Americans in major
[25:00.480 --> 25:05.680]  polls that believe guns are illegal and the types that call the police on their
[25:05.680 --> 25:10.360]  neighbor if they see them putting a gun in their car the type of people that
[25:10.360 --> 25:16.080]  routinely I see in the news all the time I know you see it as well call the
[25:16.080 --> 25:21.400]  police if they see a mother spat their son or daughter on the hind end at a
[25:21.400 --> 25:26.520]  target or grocery store parking lot now the child's talking back not doing what
[25:26.520 --> 25:30.400]  they're told throwing a fit mama gives them a few spats they call the police
[25:30.400 --> 25:35.120]  the police come CPS come they take you to jail they take your kid it's not
[25:35.120 --> 25:41.440]  illegal in fact they were trying that Democrats were trying to pass a bill
[25:41.440 --> 25:46.240]  that to corporately punish Texas school children in the government training
[25:46.240 --> 25:51.000]  centers that they would have to get a parent sign-off permission and the
[25:51.000 --> 25:55.640]  Republican legislature killed the bill oh you didn't know that they still in
[25:55.640 --> 26:00.880]  public schools all over the country take a big wooden board and pop you so hard
[26:00.880 --> 26:05.040]  with it it leaves bruises by the way I think it's a good idea let me tell you
[26:05.040 --> 26:10.040]  something that was one of the things that made me behave myself in middle
[26:10.040 --> 26:14.760]  school in high school of course they learned that that didn't work so they
[26:14.760 --> 26:18.840]  would run me because I was also you know in the sports program they'd say after
[26:18.840 --> 26:23.040]  school you're gonna meet me out at the track and they would run me till I
[26:23.040 --> 26:29.400]  threw up and that was the end of it but once they lose control of the youth and
[26:29.400 --> 26:32.760]  they all act like a bunch of criminals then they get tasered they go to prison
[26:32.760 --> 26:41.320]  you must have discipline just like dog training or anything else now I'm I'm
[26:41.320 --> 26:48.800]  torn though on the issue of the school not having to ask permission because
[26:48.800 --> 26:53.640]  I do believe in corporal punishment but at the same time why would the
[26:53.640 --> 26:57.840]  Republicans say that parents shouldn't be able to make that decision I mean if
[26:57.840 --> 27:03.200]  the child's out of control they're just expelled that's the end of it and these
[27:03.200 --> 27:07.560]  schools are out of control which is part of the social engineers plan they knew
[27:07.560 --> 27:11.880]  full well with Dr. Spock and all those children's books they put out for
[27:11.880 --> 27:16.040]  parents 50 years ago that it was gonna cause societal breakdown that's always
[27:16.040 --> 27:20.640]  been the plan they didn't want the parents putting their values into the
[27:20.640 --> 27:25.280]  children they wanted parents to stand back let your kid be themselves not so
[27:25.280 --> 27:28.720]  they'd be themselves but so the television set and the public school
[27:28.720 --> 27:35.120]  could indoctrinate them with the new values of anti-gun anti-liberty
[27:35.120 --> 27:39.640]  anti-private property low test scores that's why they've gotten rid of many
[27:39.640 --> 27:44.360]  test scores they've gotten rid of the a-plus the e for excellence they've
[27:44.360 --> 27:47.480]  gotten rid of the dodgeball they've gotten rid of all of it because they're
[27:47.480 --> 27:57.200]  being turned into domesticated cowardly spoiled rotten ninnies but that itself is
[27:57.200 --> 28:04.400]  a side issue it is not illegal to spank your children it is illegal to break
[28:04.400 --> 28:10.360]  their wrist it is illegal to punch them in the nose because that's a salt but
[28:10.360 --> 28:15.480]  they put out this mass hoax that it's illegal to spank your children where
[28:15.480 --> 28:19.360]  then people are even afraid to and then their children are out of control and
[28:19.360 --> 28:25.240]  run out into traffic and get run over you see you can intellectually try to
[28:25.240 --> 28:30.040]  reason with children but at a certain point they have to be disciplined the
[28:30.040 --> 28:34.480]  third time they try to stick their finger in the light socket the third
[28:34.480 --> 28:37.720]  time they walk over the stove try to stick their hand in the flame that's
[28:37.720 --> 28:41.760]  what two-year-olds do the third time they do it you've got to whack them on the
[28:41.760 --> 28:47.360]  hand so they understand when you do that it causes pain do you understand my
[28:47.360 --> 28:55.480]  wife took piano from when she lived in Madrid for four years from a very famous
[28:55.480 --> 29:02.120]  piano teacher I'm gonna say the name very famous and her family was able to
[29:02.120 --> 29:08.000]  get her in there because of connections in music she has some family their
[29:08.000 --> 29:12.080]  concert pianist and violinist they were able to get her in but the woman would
[29:12.080 --> 29:17.600]  beat her hands and this is when my wife was a teenager would beat her hands with
[29:17.600 --> 29:22.880]  a yardstick and sometimes beat them bloody when she made mistakes because
[29:22.880 --> 29:26.880]  that's just how everybody was taught to play piano going back you know 500 years
[29:26.880 --> 29:31.560]  of course and I'm not even saying that is a good thing overall but that's what
[29:31.560 --> 29:36.760]  produced concert masters is that you're making mistakes your brain is gonna find
[29:36.760 --> 29:42.760]  a way to do it right and when you make a mistake whack whack whack the point is
[29:42.760 --> 29:47.400]  it works the system knows that now they teach you not to discipline but then
[29:47.400 --> 29:50.640]  they taser you or stomp your brains out when you're a spoiled rotten teenager

[33:29.640 --> 33:33.800]  exact same video it would have been too obvious if they release the audio with
[33:33.800 --> 33:38.160]  it because he'd be saying the exact same thing so they just cut the audio out
[33:38.160 --> 33:43.480]  they've now shown senator inhofe some of the fake photos of bin laden or

[34:29.040 --> 34:32.000]  big news that Pachennik's also going to be talking about with us top doctor
[34:32.000 --> 34:36.400]  confirms bin laden had Marfan syndrome that's prisonplanet.com and
[34:36.400 --> 34:40.760]  info wars.com MSNBC hit piece unwittingly reveals
[34:40.760 --> 34:48.200]  cooperation for Dr. Steve our Pachennik's assertion that Osama died in 2001 we're
[34:48.200 --> 34:53.120]  going to be breaking all of that down and here is that MSNBC article for
[34:53.120 --> 34:57.960]  prisonplanet.tv viewers for radio listeners just search new life for an
[34:57.960 --> 35:06.560]  old rumor was bin laden a Marfanoid by Jonel Alika I think it pronounced it the
[35:06.560 --> 35:11.320]  health writer so there you have it we're going to be going over that and I
[35:11.320 --> 35:17.360]  produced a special video that Aaron even though I ordered not to do it spent two
[35:17.360 --> 35:21.160]  days up editing and putting together with documentation for every claim I
[35:21.160 --> 35:28.360]  make it is extremely powerful video and it's up on info wars.com and
[35:28.360 --> 35:32.440]  prisonplanet.com right now is the top story we need to get this out to
[35:32.440 --> 35:38.320]  everyone proof bin laden death another government lie proof bin laden death
[35:38.320 --> 35:43.760]  another government lie and again why is this so important because the White
[35:43.760 --> 35:48.640]  House advisors Robert Shapiro and others last year in the Financial Times of
[35:48.640 --> 35:52.960]  London and other publications other top advisors and Glenn Beck even talked
[35:52.960 --> 35:57.400]  about this came out and said we need a new Oklahoma City to blame on domestic
[35:57.400 --> 36:02.600]  groups and a new 9-11 to make the president look strong he needs to look
[36:02.600 --> 36:07.360]  like he can protect this and be decisive and get things done in a tax also
[36:07.360 --> 36:10.600]  maybe we'll rally around him so without that his agenda is dead he will not be
[36:10.600 --> 36:15.040]  reelected they went on to say Bill Clinton had a 40% approval rating it
[36:15.040 --> 36:21.080]  went to 61 to 63 depending on which poll you looked at Gallup USA today 63 61
[36:21.080 --> 36:25.320]  right before the election and Bill Clinton told reporters on Air Force One
[36:25.320 --> 36:29.200]  after his reelection he said I owe it to Oklahoma City bombing it brought us
[36:29.200 --> 36:33.720]  together yeah the Hitler blowing up the Reichstag firebombing it brought the
[36:33.720 --> 36:38.520]  Germans together to Hitler staged attack on their own military basic
[36:38.520 --> 36:43.560]  Glywitz on the Polish border brought the Germans together to attack Poland as if
[36:43.560 --> 36:51.160]  a 19th century military would attack the Germans but hey it was fun it's fun to
[36:51.160 --> 36:56.080]  gang up on people in caves that you know are easy to beat it's fun to gang up on
[36:56.080 --> 37:01.240]  the polls when the Germans had the most modern military it's fun to stomp on
[37:01.240 --> 37:04.360]  some people and blow up their cities because after all they attacked our
[37:04.360 --> 37:09.240]  basic Glywitz of course declassified it didn't happen totally fake but it's fun
[37:09.240 --> 37:14.680]  it's fun it's fun to be conned so they're getting ready to launch new wars
[37:14.680 --> 37:18.720]  against Pakistan you see that saber rattling intensifying new reports out
[37:18.720 --> 37:22.080]  of the government plans to seize the nuclear weapons by invading their
[37:22.080 --> 37:26.560]  military bases told you that was coming months ago because it's all following a
[37:26.560 --> 37:30.960]  script it's a nice smoke screen for all the other wars they're launching in the
[37:30.960 --> 37:34.920]  attempted overthrow of Syria that's intensifying into month number two right
[37:34.920 --> 37:39.880]  now the our media says oh the government of the it's illegal to try to kill
[37:39.880 --> 37:44.080]  Qaddafi who may deals with them six years ago get those WMD's they're not
[37:44.080 --> 37:48.160]  trying to kill him they just keep bombing all of his homes every day they
[37:48.160 --> 37:51.920]  thought he was dead for a week they said and then he popped back up on TV and so
[37:51.920 --> 37:57.480]  within minutes they tried to bomb the facility he was in oh but then they lied
[37:57.480 --> 38:01.880]  to us we're not trying to assassinate him no we just bomb everywhere he is and
[38:01.880 --> 38:08.000]  keep killing members of his family and Al Qaeda is the core group and the leaders
[38:08.000 --> 38:12.720]  of the Al Qaeda were people who were at black sites for years they grabbed these
[38:12.720 --> 38:17.040]  people as double agents they train them it turns out that's what Camp X-ray is
[38:17.040 --> 38:22.000]  they kind of a public camp for the 14 15 year olds that the CIA admits they grab
[38:22.000 --> 38:25.760]  who were innocent out of Afghanistan and Yemen and other places then they've got
[38:25.760 --> 38:29.640]  internal camps that are really training centers where they psychologically
[38:29.640 --> 38:34.920]  evaluate people find out who they want to use send those they want to kill the
[38:34.920 --> 38:39.400]  European or Egyptian black sites and the others get recruited then get sent to
[38:39.400 --> 38:43.320]  Lainley for training and then get dispatched I mean it's all public that's
[38:43.320 --> 38:49.480]  how totally ruthless and totally dark these people are and so that's why we've
[38:49.480 --> 38:53.320]  got to expose the bin Laden fable because it attempts to back up the
[38:53.320 --> 39:00.720]  original 9-11 outside job fable right as they push the total media takeover grid
[39:00.720 --> 39:05.480]  the the internet and cell phone and TV radio takeover switch the cyber
[39:05.480 --> 39:10.920]  security act now in the defense bill they're trying to pass as we speak it's
[39:10.920 --> 39:14.960]  now been attached as a writer as they go ahead and flip the switches the grids
[39:14.960 --> 39:20.040]  already in place why because the fortune 100 and the top five or six telecoms
[39:20.040 --> 39:23.600]  are owned by the big mega banks that own and run our government through fraud
[39:23.600 --> 39:28.440]  and so the government comes and gives them mandated billions a year as part of
[39:28.440 --> 39:32.840]  the telecommunications acts that are reauthorized every year to put in the
[39:32.840 --> 39:37.760]  hubs put in the equipment put in the systems FCC comes in with regulations to
[39:37.760 --> 39:42.120]  put the spy takeover chips in all the cell phones all the computers now all
[39:42.120 --> 39:46.760]  the new appliances rolling out have all the spy chips where data over power line
[39:46.760 --> 39:52.400]  goes into the plug-in socket that has a chip now on all new major appliances that
[39:52.400 --> 39:57.080]  turn the device into a surveillance system oh don't believe me yesterday's
[39:57.080 --> 40:01.680]  headline please put it on screen Google wants to take over your house and they
[40:01.680 --> 40:06.280]  say yes we're now going to dial in to all of your appliances and even if you
[40:06.280 --> 40:10.520]  don't have the newest appliances they will access your computer with the new
[40:10.520 --> 40:14.640]  fluorescent bulbs with data over power lines they can send data they've been
[40:14.640 --> 40:18.040]  doing it for 20 years over power lines now they're transmitting over all major
[40:18.040 --> 40:23.520]  power line systems it sends a controlled signal off of switching boxes in your
[40:23.520 --> 40:30.600]  area down it goes into the flickering fluorescent now all you must have them
[40:30.600 --> 40:36.600]  the fluorescent then at an ultra fast movement flashes code similar to Morse code
[40:36.600 --> 40:41.480]  at your computer and now all the major operating systems have these built in
[40:41.480 --> 40:46.640]  for your computer to be remotely accessed and controlled there it is Google
[40:46.640 --> 40:51.320]  wants Android to take over your home with Android home Metro yeah that's not
[40:51.320 --> 40:55.160]  the CNN do me a favor reprint me the CNN because I want to I want to read their
[40:55.160 --> 40:58.800]  quotes for everybody where they say everything will be controlled by us your
[40:58.800 --> 41:03.760]  garage door opener your dishwasher your laundry everything will be surveilled
[41:03.760 --> 41:08.160]  this was always the plan but notice it's not just that Google the known NSA CIA
[41:08.160 --> 41:14.920]  front is doing this at the exact same time all globally what the Japanese
[41:14.920 --> 41:19.440]  Chinese South Koreans make what's what's made in the US global standardization
[41:19.440 --> 41:22.880]  same thing in Japan same thing in Germany same thing in England same thing
[41:22.880 --> 41:28.440]  in Australia global standardization where all the devices are designed to be
[41:28.440 --> 41:32.960]  taken over by this system and the public schools are announcing yes you're
[41:32.960 --> 41:36.960]  we're watching your kids at home oh and also reprint me because I know I gave
[41:36.960 --> 41:41.480]  the reports to Rob Jacobson and do or putting out some special reports on it
[41:41.480 --> 41:45.600]  so it's not in my stack now the AP article about two million dollar
[41:45.600 --> 41:50.560]  Department of Defense federal grant in San Antonio at one elementary and they
[41:50.560 --> 41:54.760]  tell you to help save food money to decide what to feed the kids if they're
[41:54.760 --> 41:59.200]  being wasteful and it says it analyzes even a half-eaten pair and everything's
[41:59.200 --> 42:04.800]  fine and it's about your children's nutrition department of defense federal
[42:04.800 --> 42:08.720]  grant they care so much and I've seen reports all over the country they have
[42:08.720 --> 42:13.080]  AI software hooked into cameras in the classrooms in the bathrooms recording
[42:13.080 --> 42:17.440]  all audio putting it into digital databases their voice print analysis of
[42:17.440 --> 42:22.040]  all of your the children according to seating arrangements the children write
[42:22.040 --> 42:27.000]  reports on government issued computers those then put in a large database if
[42:27.000 --> 42:30.160]  you're doubting me on this just look it up it's what the connect system the
[42:30.160 --> 42:35.640]  Microsoft platform is that can know up to 14 people's voices in the room in the
[42:35.640 --> 42:40.600]  house and follows your facial and body movements for the video game you then
[42:40.600 --> 42:44.320]  put your credit card info your purchases your internet surfing and only
[42:44.320 --> 42:47.760]  cost a few hundred dollars because as Bill Gates said eight years ago we're
[42:47.760 --> 42:51.320]  going to take your home over with this and he spent seven years developing it
[42:51.320 --> 42:56.840]  and they rolled it out last year all of it is unified unified devices that track
[42:56.840 --> 43:02.400]  and surveil and face print it also face scans voice print everything those
[43:02.400 --> 43:06.360]  systems are also rolling out in all of the public schools children thumb
[43:06.360 --> 43:10.360]  scanning to get their school lunch thumb scanning to get library books
[43:10.360 --> 43:14.040]  parents being given ID cards even be able to come get their kids they're
[43:14.040 --> 43:19.600]  being face scanned and enrolled total system of absolute big brother takeover
[43:19.600 --> 43:24.360]  and it's bigger than the Manhattan Project globally trillions of dollars to
[43:24.360 --> 43:28.320]  put this whole grid in face scanning cameras license plate reading cameras
[43:28.320 --> 43:32.840]  they've got biometric cameras even if you're wearing a mask that shoot through
[43:32.840 --> 43:36.640]  your clothes they get the body print when you go to the clothing stores that
[43:36.640 --> 43:40.200]  now have body scanners for quote better fitting that's been sold to the feds the
[43:40.200 --> 43:45.080]  body scanners in the malls going in also at the airports I told you that ten
[43:45.080 --> 43:48.720]  years ago last year they admitted that yes they are saving the body scans and
[43:48.720 --> 43:52.440]  getting a 360 biometric scan of the body at the airport that's one of the main
[43:52.440 --> 43:57.160]  functions of the system again you think I'm joking this is the full spectrum
[43:57.160 --> 44:01.360]  total takeover where they can turn off any devices they want where they can
[44:01.360 --> 44:05.480]  surveil everything going on your home but even better ripping you off in fact
[44:05.480 --> 44:08.200]  people won't believe it I did some searching last night and found unlimited
[44:08.200 --> 44:16.920]  articles power company what was on PG&E I think it's the name try this power
[44:16.920 --> 44:22.320]  company admits smart meters overcharging oh it's an accident we
[44:22.320 --> 44:27.920]  doubled your prices once the smart meter went in they tell you it's gonna save
[44:27.920 --> 44:31.560]  you money and they're gonna control it but really it's there to create the
[44:31.560 --> 44:37.080]  algorithms to track what's happening and rip you off and I know you're gonna love
[44:37.080 --> 44:41.480]  it because being ripped off is what people are into because it's so much
[44:41.480 --> 44:44.960]  fun to get scared of bin Laden it's so much fun to roll around in fear at night
[44:44.960 --> 44:47.600]  in a field position with your wife as you cry
[44:47.600 --> 44:53.320]  it's gonna get me they stick your hands down my pants give me cancer viruses in
[44:53.320 --> 44:57.840]  the shots give me statin drugs to eat my brain protect me fluoride I want bone

[45:02.680 --> 45:05.760]  spies against me please make me a prisoner though it's such land of the
[45:05.760 --> 45:08.840]  free home of the brave dev a hundred thousand preachers now publicly trained
[45:08.840 --> 45:13.520]  to spy on their flocks oh oh that movie red dawn that fictional account those
[45:13.520 --> 45:16.720]  kids are the bad guys because in that movie the preacher spying on everybody

[45:31.640 --> 45:35.920]  Minnesota there's also out of Texas where they have the flickering computer
[45:35.920 --> 45:40.200]  controlled fluorescence that just so happened other studies show that that
[45:40.200 --> 45:42.920]  can put you in a mesmerized state but get everything they roll out as
[45:42.920 --> 45:46.920]  multifaceted uses it doesn't just control your computer it controls you

[46:02.600 --> 46:07.360]  major GMO crop that comes out has the accidental side effect of reducing
[46:07.360 --> 46:11.640]  fertility and increasing cancer and bowel diseases all off the chart and we
[46:11.640 --> 46:15.960]  interview top genetic engineer scientist from Russia and England in the US on
[46:15.960 --> 46:19.400]  record who would be there and say this potato is sterilizing the mice and they
[46:19.400 --> 46:23.280]  go that's not an accidental trait let's not discuss it but this is gonna
[46:23.280 --> 46:28.520]  sterilize people there's too many people doctor come on you know that I mean
[46:28.520 --> 46:32.480]  they're just savage weapons system attacking savaging everyone and the

[46:35.400 --> 46:39.400]  petty power position everybody loves being killed and hurt mutilated and
[46:39.400 --> 46:43.520]  attacked and brainwashed and dumbed down and the plunging IQs and the dumbed
[46:43.520 --> 46:47.680]  down slobbering foaming at the mouth populations they're just begging to be
[46:47.680 --> 46:53.320]  hurt begging to be exterminated as the background attacks just intensify with
[46:53.320 --> 47:01.280]  the ambient level of soft-killed being incrementally turned up with it with
[47:01.280 --> 47:05.760]  humanity and the human soul and all our innocent children caught in the jaws of
[47:05.760 --> 47:09.720]  this super predator class who's just sitting back taking their time slowly
[47:09.720 --> 47:15.000]  gutting us totally destroying us yeah here's the Huffington Post tech section
[47:15.000 --> 47:20.160]  LVX system ceiling likes send coded internet data going into government
[47:20.160 --> 47:26.600]  buildings a PG any smart meters overcharge thousands in BC oh double
[47:26.600 --> 47:32.000]  charging such an accident oh everything controlled nothing you can do about it
[47:32.000 --> 47:37.080]  once the grid's in place just total savage ripoffs and they love it remember
[47:37.080 --> 47:40.960]  Enron some days making over a billion dollars a day just in California fake
[47:40.960 --> 47:44.480]  trading computers that they'd give Congress people tears of then they would
[47:44.480 --> 47:50.720]  the the phone recordings of it that have been released where where Ken lays
[47:50.720 --> 47:54.560]  people from Enron would call at the power plant and go we need you to cut
[47:54.560 --> 47:59.840]  power today how's that sound they'd say absolutely thanks for the call they'd
[47:59.840 --> 48:03.800]  hang up the phone and then oh there's blackouts there's not enough power we
[48:03.800 --> 48:08.280]  got triple charge yeah and the average yuppie can't admit they're being conned
[48:08.280 --> 48:14.600]  their delusion a little make-believe ego maniacs who are so narcissistic they
[48:14.600 --> 48:18.520]  can't admit that somebody's screwing them so they just giggle and say I'm not
[48:18.520 --> 48:24.600]  being ripped off we really are having power outages and again just loving
[48:24.600 --> 48:29.760]  being ripped off loving being conned loving it just begging for it will not
[48:29.760 --> 48:34.200]  me all right I'm ranting I'm angry ladies and gentlemen that's because I
[48:34.200 --> 48:41.320]  swam and jogged this morning Google wants to control your home first Google
[48:41.320 --> 48:48.880]  dominated the web with search mitted in I say then it ruled mobile devices with
[48:48.880 --> 48:52.560]  Android totally surveilling you now Google wants to control everything inside
[48:52.560 --> 48:57.600]  your home at its annual IO developers conference in San Francisco on Tuesday
[48:57.600 --> 49:02.520]  the company previewed the Android home a future platform it's already the grids
[49:02.520 --> 49:06.680]  already completely going in that will allow you see total concerted through of
[49:06.680 --> 49:10.360]  all of industry it's only a less than a hundred of these companies you get the
[49:10.360 --> 49:13.680]  SPP documents from the North American Union it's fortune 100 they're telling
[49:13.680 --> 49:17.560]  government what to do first item on the agenda stealth integration with America
[49:17.560 --> 49:21.920]  keep this from the public we're gonna fund ourselves with a carbon tax these
[49:21.920 --> 49:26.200]  slaves will put up with anything get them and its annual IO developers
[49:26.200 --> 49:29.560]  conference in San Francisco on Tuesday the company previewed Android home a
[49:29.560 --> 49:33.960]  future platform that will allow you to interact practically any electronic
[49:33.960 --> 49:38.280]  device you own using Google connected device like a home media equipment
[49:38.280 --> 49:42.400]  dishwashers cars lights could soon be able to control using the new platform
[49:42.400 --> 49:47.240]  that they'll control that they'll rip you off with that they'll study your human
[49:47.240 --> 49:51.640]  behavior and create algorithms they can already predict the future with over 93
[49:51.640 --> 49:56.360]  percent total control probability just with Google searches tracking mass
[49:56.360 --> 50:00.960]  movements this is a crystal ball can and a kill switch these people are
[50:00.960 --> 50:04.960]  geniuses but they are evil we like to think of your entire home as an
[50:04.960 --> 50:09.560]  accessory or better yet a network of accessories and think of Android as the
[50:09.560 --> 50:15.160]  operating system for your home said Joe Britt head of the Android home team see

[50:24.560 --> 50:28.680]  anything you're not ashamed of well I may be in my house frying eggs up and
[50:28.680 --> 50:32.000]  drinking orange juice but it's not your business to come look through my window
[50:32.000 --> 50:37.240]  but see that's the attitude we're gonna watch everything you're doing you know

[50:40.240 --> 50:43.440]  hide but meanwhile government industry are totally secretive because they're a

[50:48.680 --> 50:56.000]  only are lackadaisical servile we need behavior and our willingness to be
[50:56.000 --> 51:01.360]  dumbed down has allowed these lesser men to do this to us I want to route up hi

[51:10.360 --> 51:14.160]  unemployed Americans is to go to college and seek a higher education but all
[51:14.160 --> 51:18.040]  across America students are graduating with hundreds of thousands of dollars
[51:18.040 --> 51:22.160]  in debt and no jobs most college graduates are now admitting that they
[51:22.160 --> 51:25.880]  would have been better off getting a job at Walmart or McDonald's than having

[54:07.400 --> 54:12.880]  raving because it's a normal response to a scientific enslavement surveillance
[54:12.880 --> 54:18.120]  grid being put in where everything in your house can be surveilled and turned
[54:18.120 --> 54:22.880]  off by the government of private industry and children with two million
[54:22.880 --> 54:27.800]  dollar camera systems analyzing how they eat under department of defense grants
[54:27.800 --> 54:33.360]  in San Antonio Texas I mean this is a creepy group of eugenicists who are
[54:33.360 --> 54:37.240]  setting up their world government as a system to reduce world population force
[54:37.240 --> 54:46.640] ably that's their plan and you read this article one deception they say the chief
[54:46.640 --> 54:50.440]  obstacle to making that happen across all connected devices is finding a sink
[54:50.440 --> 54:55.080]  single open standard to control everything on your own it says right now
[54:55.080 --> 54:58.200]  Apple Google they all have different systems that's not true the cyber
[54:58.200 --> 55:03.320]  security system already in place for four years standardizes the the code keys
[55:03.320 --> 55:08.440]  and and has chips put in all devices that are takeover chips which they now
[55:08.440 --> 55:12.120]  admitted to you this week they rolled it out because of the bin Laden being so
[55:12.120 --> 55:15.640]  scary we're going to now have alerts that break in and take over your phone
[55:15.640 --> 55:20.200]  nobody goes well how was that already pre-programmed how are you able to do
[55:20.200 --> 55:25.480]  that well we're we have a takeover chip oh but we just decided this week to take
[55:25.480 --> 55:30.720]  your phone over it's all a strategic rollout it's a blueprint that they fall
[55:30.720 --> 55:34.760]  and they take their time and they gauge it as they move and make small changes
[55:34.760 --> 55:39.520]  where all of society farms ranches vitamins everything is taken over by
[55:39.520 --> 55:43.240]  big industry all right I want to go to a clip ahead of dr. Steve Pacinic joining
[55:43.240 --> 55:48.160]  us this has been laden son the one that his anti-war didn't like him kind of a
[55:48.160 --> 55:52.200]  hippie with you know he's got the hippie haircut and all the rest of it coming
[55:52.200 --> 55:58.280]  out and saying I'm not even sure that my dad is dead or that they killed him but
[55:58.280 --> 56:02.720]  the media spun it like he was saying if you did kill any murdered him and he
[56:02.720 --> 56:05.840]  deserved a fair trial they're like how dare you want a fair trial well if you
[56:05.840 --> 56:09.320]  got the evidence that's why we have trials so we find out what really went
[56:09.320 --> 56:13.520]  on because under tyrannies you don't have trials they can just say sees that
[56:13.520 --> 56:19.280]  man for treason I say he's a criminal you see but they set the precedent with
[56:19.280 --> 56:24.040]  white supremacist and bin Laden and unpopular type groups for everybody else
[56:24.040 --> 56:31.080]  here's the clip from Fox where the son is saying hey in the letter I'm not even
[56:31.080 --> 56:34.520]  sure he's dead here it is this is surprising because remember this is the
[56:34.520 --> 56:39.880]  son of Osama bin Laden who left Osama bin Laden in 1999 along with his mother
[56:39.880 --> 56:44.320]  because they didn't like the way in which bin Laden was living his life and
[56:44.320 --> 56:47.080]  then he went on to write a book about what it was like to grow up as a bin
[56:47.080 --> 56:52.200]  Laden so here now is his statement post-death we are not convinced on the
[56:52.200 --> 56:56.080]  available evidence in the absence of a dead body photographs and video evidence
[56:56.080 --> 57:00.320]  that our natural father is dead if he has been summarily executed then we
[57:00.320 --> 57:04.280]  question the propriety of such assassination we maintain that arbitrary
[57:04.280 --> 57:08.280]  killing is not a solution to political problems so I guess this is an example
[57:08.280 --> 57:13.360]  of somebody who would have benefited from the administration releasing photos
[57:13.360 --> 57:18.600]  or videotape I mean why do you buy anything from governments that have
[57:18.600 --> 57:21.680]  been caught lying over and over again as we go to break I want to play this
[57:21.680 --> 57:26.080]  clip former Colin Powell chief of staff Lawrence Wilkerson said I don't think
[57:26.080 --> 57:29.880]  they really wanted to get bin Laden no kidding he was already dead but they
[57:29.880 --> 57:35.080]  wanted to keep the boogeyman alive the idea of bin Laden to say he's hiding
[57:35.080 --> 57:39.160]  under your chair give your rights up to us we'll protect you pay the mafia
[57:39.160 --> 57:42.240]  protection money give us your liberty we'll protect you from bin Laden here
[57:42.240 --> 57:46.520]  it is about you know I think it was quite the opposite I don't think they
[57:46.520 --> 57:53.360]  really wanted to get bin Laden and it's an interesting bit of scholarship I
[57:53.360 --> 57:58.360]  think for historians to try and calculate is exactly why that occurred but I
[57:58.360 --> 58:02.200]  don't think they wanted to get bin Laden you could be very cynical and say they
[58:02.200 --> 58:06.080]  didn't want to get him because one guy even the war was over and that left all
[58:06.080 --> 58:11.200]  the political advantage gone and say that they knew that it was almost an
[58:11.200 --> 58:16.720]  impossibility okay that's good done to the intelligence yeah you've got close
[58:16.720 --> 58:20.320]  to a million private intelligence operatives in the US now on average
[58:20.320 --> 58:25.080]  making over a hundred G's a year you think they want the bin Laden to go away
[58:25.080 --> 58:29.400]  you think these intelligence agencies with fake video yeah private
[58:29.400 --> 58:33.040]  intelligence agencies have been caught faking these videos over and over again
[58:33.040 --> 58:38.600]  on record you figured it out yet they're staging all this to rob us blind we'll
[58:38.600 --> 58:50.800]  ride back this is GCN the Genesis communications radio network this is
[58:50.800 --> 58:54.200]  Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power
[58:54.200 --> 58:58.120]  generator number one new climate legislation could easily double or
[58:58.120 --> 59:02.400]  triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control how
[59:02.400 --> 59:06.680]  much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total government
[59:06.680 --> 59:11.000]  control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming number
[59:11.000 --> 59:15.080]  three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and
[59:15.080 --> 59:19.640]  now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four
[59:19.640 --> 59:23.760]  dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of
[59:23.760 --> 59:27.720]  families lose their power from weather related onages number five a solar power
[59:27.720 --> 59:31.560]  generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks I
[59:31.560 --> 59:34.280]  really believe in the solar power generators offered by solutions from
[59:34.280 --> 59:39.240]  science one of my oldest sponsors you can get more information at WWW dot my
[59:39.240 --> 59:43.360]  solar backup dot com that's my solar backup dot com remember the government
[59:43.360 --> 59:51.840]  doesn't own the Sun should go to my solar backup dot com or call 1-877-327-0365
[59:51.840 --> 01:00:06.160]  waging war on corruption Alex Jones on the GCN radio network big brother
[01:00:06.160 --> 01:00:13.480]  mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he he's
[01:00:13.480 --> 01:00:23.480]  Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin, Texas Alex Jones
[01:00:23.480 --> 01:00:29.640]  last week we fired out a couple of breakdown videos proving the fraud of
[01:00:29.640 --> 01:00:34.720]  the bin Laden killing and breaking down why they're staging it and why it's
[01:00:34.720 --> 01:00:38.200]  important to expose the hoax because they're gonna launch new wars bigger
[01:00:38.200 --> 01:00:41.800]  domestic police state crackdowns total takeover of all telecommunications
[01:00:41.800 --> 01:00:45.880]  infrastructures already been done now they're rolling it out and getting
[01:00:45.880 --> 01:00:49.720]  everybody ready for your phones to be cut off government messages to blare
[01:00:49.720 --> 01:00:58.320]  over them videos TVs to be taken over radio TV it's just every form of
[01:00:58.320 --> 01:01:03.720]  tyranny is has a rocket tied to its back and we have a 15 minute video because
[01:01:03.720 --> 01:01:07.720]  last week I turned some two videos out real fast that had a million three
[01:01:07.720 --> 01:01:10.640]  hundred thousand views between them one of them eight hundred thousand views the
[01:01:10.640 --> 01:01:15.200]  other three hundred four hundred thousand views and growing and that's a
[01:01:15.200 --> 01:01:17.720]  little key weapon in the fight against the globalist because we can really
[01:01:17.720 --> 01:01:22.360]  craft those videos get all our facts straight show each document each video
[01:01:22.360 --> 01:01:28.880]  clip really give people a historical context but now we spent Monday Tuesday
[01:01:28.880 --> 01:01:36.520]  and Wednesday three days with this 14 minute 57 second video that is a many
[01:01:36.520 --> 01:01:41.240]  documentary I mean this is very high quality fully bibliograph with links
[01:01:41.240 --> 01:01:46.440]  under the video new video proof bin Laden death another government line you
[01:01:46.440 --> 01:01:51.240]  want to fight the globalist you want to I mean we've got this little PR campaign
[01:01:51.240 --> 01:01:55.040]  by mainstream media demonizing us attacking us TV stations they've got
[01:01:55.040 --> 01:01:58.480]  fake alternative media saying stop talking about bin Laden it's a diversion
[01:01:58.480 --> 01:02:03.440]  and at a certain level it is for TEPCO Fukushima fuel rods are fully exposed
[01:02:03.440 --> 01:02:07.600]  they now admit there were explosions and more fires a few days ago even more
[01:02:07.600 --> 01:02:11.240]  radiation than ever blasting of the atmosphere coming our way the government
[01:02:11.240 --> 01:02:16.640]  raising radiation levels 500 times well that will they raise it a thousand to a
[01:02:16.640 --> 01:02:20.200]  hundred thousand depending on the isotope what they say is safe but as of
[01:02:20.200 --> 01:02:26.200]  three weeks ago certain isotopes were 500 times quote normal levels in milk and
[01:02:26.200 --> 01:02:30.200]  food in the US but there's no warnings going out because the feds you say it's
[01:02:30.200 --> 01:02:34.160]  safe drink up and enjoy yourself it's like I tell the troops use DU weapons
[01:02:34.160 --> 01:02:38.280]  you do you munitions it's good for you that's good to have four times the cancer
[01:02:38.280 --> 01:02:42.320]  and the troops that use it on record and four times the birth defects of the
[01:02:42.320 --> 01:02:47.320]  Fallujah have a 12 to 15 times in major British and US studies but you know what
[01:02:47.320 --> 01:02:52.760]  wave of magic wand everything's fine so there are some things going on and
[01:02:52.760 --> 01:02:56.520]  global meltdown of the dollar and other things but you've got to attack the
[01:02:56.520 --> 01:03:00.920]  bin Laden hoax because that's the pretext to go out for Pakistan the
[01:03:00.920 --> 01:03:05.160]  pretext for the domestic crackdown the pretext to sell the takeover of old
[01:03:05.160 --> 01:03:11.080]  transportation by TSA and we have Chuckie Schumer today in my stack with a
[01:03:11.080 --> 01:03:15.840]  press release saying yes he wants billions of dollars to quote train local
[01:03:15.840 --> 01:03:21.120]  police under TSA to do the grope downs to give them scanners to give them
[01:03:21.120 --> 01:03:25.720]  robots to set up checkpoints this is the federalization now how did I know it'd
[01:03:25.720 --> 01:03:29.240]  be local police groping you because they've done drills for eight years
[01:03:29.240 --> 01:03:34.160]  intensifying the last year we've played the newscast where folks in Miami got a
[01:03:34.160 --> 01:03:38.120]  surprise hundreds of federal and state officers showed up as part of a TSA
[01:03:38.120 --> 01:03:44.880]  training people were a fresco and given potdowns mobile scanners were on site in
[01:03:44.880 --> 01:03:48.760]  upstate New York the army was out running cars through scanners searching
[01:03:48.760 --> 01:03:52.920]  families cut to a woman being searched I think it's great to keep me safe from
[01:03:52.920 --> 01:03:57.080]  Alcada so I mean people say well how do you know what they're gonna do before
[01:03:57.080 --> 01:04:00.680]  they do it because even though what they're gonna do is secret on paper I
[01:04:00.680 --> 01:04:05.280]  can see the manifestation of it I can see the beta testing these people are
[01:04:05.280 --> 01:04:09.400]  obsessed with testing and drills and going over and I know exactly what
[01:04:09.400 --> 01:04:13.640]  they're gonna do before they roll it out because it's all public it's what I do I
[01:04:13.640 --> 01:04:20.040]  watch these people I study them I track them it's what I do I know what they're
[01:04:20.040 --> 01:04:23.360]  going to do they've been caught bringing narcotics in over and over again
[01:04:23.360 --> 01:04:26.000]  they've been caught running child kidnapping rings over and over again
[01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:30.720]  they've been caught stealing pension funds the same foreign banks that run our
[01:04:30.720 --> 01:04:34.440]  fellow reserve that got the banker bailout money are now taking the private
[01:04:34.440 --> 01:04:38.320]  pension funds that you a hundred percent paid into they're taking large

[01:08:08.680 --> 01:08:27.400]  well here's Bloomberg's bio on him dr. Stephen Pechenick is a advisor to
[01:08:27.400 --> 01:08:31.400]  tell a continuity in mr. Pechenick served as deputy assistant secretary of
[01:08:31.400 --> 01:08:35.760]  state and senior policy planner under secretaries Henry Kissinger Cyrus
[01:08:35.760 --> 01:08:40.280]  Vance George souls James Baker dr. Pechenick was the principal international
[01:08:40.280 --> 01:08:44.640]  crisis manager and hostage negotiator under secretaries Kissinger and Vance
[01:08:44.640 --> 01:08:48.040]  during that time he developed conflict resolution techniques that were
[01:08:48.040 --> 01:08:54.320]  instrumental in saving over 500 hostages that's just what Bloomberg has to say
[01:08:54.320 --> 01:08:58.840]  about him the London Telegraph talked to the Italian government and they say
[01:08:58.840 --> 01:09:07.840]  that mr. Pechenick was also instrumental in the red brigade getting rid of the
[01:09:07.840 --> 01:09:12.200]  Italian prime minister I'm gonna see from dr. Pechenick if that's accurate
[01:09:12.200 --> 01:09:17.800]  what they're saying there he also reportedly was a private individual
[01:09:17.800 --> 01:09:22.680]  assassin that worked on overthrowing governments he of course also is co
[01:09:22.680 --> 01:09:29.000]  authored many of the books with Tom Clancy that's on record and also is at
[01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:34.640]  IMDB the International Movie Database as the producer of some of those books into
[01:09:34.640 --> 01:09:39.600]  TV and movies and and perhaps later in the second hour today we'll open the
[01:09:39.600 --> 01:09:44.040]  phones up to take your questions but also talk a little bit about the the
[01:09:44.040 --> 01:09:49.360]  novels and what went into making them so realistic and maybe get his view on what
[01:09:49.360 --> 01:09:53.720]  Tom Clancy who I was reading last night that they're working on some new books
[01:09:53.720 --> 01:09:57.840]  together what his views are on this but I would imagine that he probably won't
[01:09:57.840 --> 01:10:02.360]  want to speak for Tom Clancy perhaps he can help us get him on the broadcast I
[01:10:02.360 --> 01:10:07.200]  know a year before 9-11 Tom Clancy wrote a book about passenger jet being
[01:10:07.200 --> 01:10:10.560]  flown to the World Trade Center I wonder if that's one of the books that
[01:10:10.560 --> 01:10:14.120]  Pechenick advised on I know he's listed as the co-author on quite a few of them
[01:10:14.120 --> 01:10:19.680]  but he joins us now I want to get into what's happening with the economy what's
[01:10:19.680 --> 01:10:24.080]  happening with the dollar what's happening with the talk of us losing
[01:10:24.080 --> 01:10:29.880]  our AAA rating because Dr. Pechenick has also done a lot of work in those
[01:10:29.880 --> 01:10:36.320]  areas the war drums being beaten to go after Pakistan now that's becoming more
[01:10:36.320 --> 01:10:40.520]  and more clear what's happening in Libya I mean I want to pick his brand a lot of
[01:10:40.520 --> 01:10:45.760]  subjects but before we go any further I called Dr. Pechenick yesterday to get
[01:10:45.760 --> 01:10:50.120]  him back on I gave him a few days rest after he graciously joined us Tuesday
[01:10:50.120 --> 01:10:53.880]  Wednesday Thursday and Friday of last week because the listeners are just
[01:10:53.880 --> 01:10:59.520]  demanding it and it's you know just amazing insight obviously but I preface
[01:10:59.520 --> 01:11:04.480]  it with Dr. Pechenick saying have you seen this MSNBC article and I said no
[01:11:04.480 --> 01:11:09.040]  well he emailed it to me because there have literally been thousands of blogs
[01:11:09.040 --> 01:11:13.640]  hundreds of foreign and domestic newspapers you name it that have
[01:11:13.640 --> 01:11:18.240]  reported on that the Pechenick interviews here on air and they've had to
[01:11:18.240 --> 01:11:21.520]  admit well Madeline Albright did concur with him a year after he first said it
[01:11:21.520 --> 01:11:26.280]  on Alex Jones in 2002 in April that yes they had him froze and were planning to
[01:11:26.280 --> 01:11:29.960]  roll him out of the politically expedient time I also have two White
[01:11:29.960 --> 01:11:33.240]  House sources told me the same thing then Teresa Heinz Kerry came out then
[01:11:33.240 --> 01:11:37.440]  Walter Cronkite the late Walter Cronkite came out those are all on record and we
[01:11:37.440 --> 01:11:41.760]  break it down on our new video proof bin Laden death another government lie
[01:11:41.760 --> 01:11:46.560]  please get that out to everybody because on this lie they're trying to boost his
[01:11:46.560 --> 01:11:50.680]  approval ratings get the domestic police state rollout the internal
[01:11:50.680 --> 01:11:55.440]  checkpoints the internal passports the local police openly federalized that's
[01:11:55.440 --> 01:11:59.920]  in CBS News today to do the grope downs of the slave training and the body
[01:11:59.920 --> 01:12:04.320]  scanners at bus stations train stations highway checkpoints now the new
[01:12:04.320 --> 01:12:09.920]  cybersecurity takeover of all internet devices the standardization is already
[01:12:09.920 --> 01:12:16.000]  in all the cell phones with the new kill code chip where the president has now
[01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:20.360]  announced he will break in cut off your phone conversations smart phones you're
[01:12:20.360 --> 01:12:25.800]  going to get video and text regular phones just text with government
[01:12:25.800 --> 01:12:31.200]  mandatory messages 9,000 telescreens at town squares mall of America all Walmart
[01:12:31.200 --> 01:12:36.160]  locations now getting them of 800 over 400 already have them saying you know
[01:12:36.160 --> 01:12:42.120]  don't trust your neighbors right out of 1984 show their entire agenda is based
[01:12:42.120 --> 01:12:47.760]  on re invoking the lie of the false flag of 9-11 and you notice after the attack
[01:12:47.760 --> 01:12:52.480]  and then now after the supposed killing of bin Laden we're being told we've got
[01:12:52.480 --> 01:12:56.800]  to now give up our rights we've got there's gonna be more attacks it's gonna
[01:12:56.800 --> 01:13:03.040]  be worse there's nukes buried KSM under torture says if bin Laden's killed
[01:13:03.040 --> 01:13:07.480]  they're gonna nuke us that came out two weeks before they're really hyping it
[01:13:07.480 --> 01:13:12.960]  to get a new false flag ready to really drop the hammer on this soft martial
[01:13:12.960 --> 01:13:16.740]  long rid they put in that they're now starting to warm up and move to the
[01:13:16.740 --> 01:13:21.520]  front burner so dr. Pachennick said have you seen this and I said no and I had
[01:13:21.520 --> 01:13:26.120]  forgotten all this information but they did a hit piece on dr. Pachennick new
[01:13:26.120 --> 01:13:32.720]  life for an old rumor was bin Laden a Marfanoi and they go and they talk to the
[01:13:32.720 --> 01:13:44.240]  top doctor Richard Devereaux they go and talk who was trained at the same
[01:13:44.240 --> 01:13:51.560]  facility the dr. Pachennick was well he's Harvard and MIT Devereaux the
[01:13:51.560 --> 01:13:55.400]  Cornell Medical Center in New York Presbyterian expert who treats patients
[01:13:55.400 --> 01:14:01.200]  with Marfa syndrome so he doesn't want to talk about it but yes bin Laden is a
[01:14:01.200 --> 01:14:06.360]  Marfanoi or someone who has this syndrome which is very debilitating and
[01:14:06.360 --> 01:14:11.560]  at the point that bin Laden was at but on his deathbed CBS News confirmed in
[01:14:11.560 --> 01:14:16.240]  Dubai at the American hospital being visited by the CIA I guess getting his
[01:14:16.240 --> 01:14:20.000]  agreement to play the part from the grave of this boogeyman to now be
[01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:27.040]  resurrected again and then killed again but he confirmed that yes he clearly
[01:14:27.040 --> 01:14:35.480]  has this syndrome and that's our article that we have now up on prison
[01:14:35.480 --> 01:14:41.560]  planet calm and info wars calm top doctor confirms bin Laden had Marfan
[01:14:41.560 --> 01:14:46.880]  syndrome on top of it he had total failure of the kidneys that was on
[01:14:46.880 --> 01:14:51.960]  record the on the outside that you live maybe five six years with and this
[01:14:51.960 --> 01:14:56.600]  other degenerative disease and there he is in this squalid cesspit that they
[01:14:56.600 --> 01:15:03.840]  told us was a palace and they confirm no dialysis equipment so dr. Steve
[01:15:03.840 --> 01:15:08.240]  Pachennick that's a five-minute intro I just wanted to preface everything what
[01:15:08.240 --> 01:15:12.520]  does this signify that they've tried to demonize you so much as you told me
[01:15:12.520 --> 01:15:16.920]  yesterday the intelligence community creates names like deathers birthers
[01:15:16.920 --> 01:15:20.480]  just like conspiracy theorists to put a label on things now they have
[01:15:20.480 --> 01:15:25.080]  death erism within hours of my report a week and a half ago on Sunday evening
[01:15:25.080 --> 01:15:30.720]  this has all the telltale signs what does it signify even in their own hit
[01:15:30.720 --> 01:15:34.280]  piece having to admit that he had a terminal disease and couldn't be alive
[01:15:34.280 --> 01:15:39.520]  today well what happens in the intelligence community and you and I
[01:15:39.520 --> 01:15:43.560]  expected and I'm sure your audience does number one you know the intelligence
[01:15:43.560 --> 01:15:47.680]  community always assumes that we the American people are dumber than they
[01:15:47.680 --> 01:15:51.880]  are in the politicians in the White House we're really now I see Tom
[01:15:51.880 --> 01:15:56.280]  Donlan and Ben Rhodes are really second quality politicians who come out of
[01:15:56.280 --> 01:16:01.400]  lobbying and local politics in New York so they have no understanding of you
[01:16:01.400 --> 01:16:05.320]  have or the American public and what happens in the intelligence community
[01:16:05.320 --> 01:16:10.000]  it's kind of a kabuki once somebody like me who's been in the National Security
[01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:14.880]  and again I'm not a whistleblower I don't have a top secret clearance you came
[01:16:14.880 --> 01:16:19.600]  forth and and your people came forth and I said look this is a lie the lie
[01:16:19.600 --> 01:16:24.200]  doesn't work yet enough of this nonsense and can try to manipulate the
[01:16:24.200 --> 01:16:29.120]  American public for the benefit of the political expediency of this president
[01:16:29.120 --> 01:16:33.880]  and the former president and the former president Bush Jr. Clinton the issue is
[01:16:33.880 --> 01:16:38.400]  very simply by by saying that we are conspirators number one they try to be
[01:16:38.400 --> 01:16:42.680]  legitimized by putting in a category that doesn't work anymore whether we're
[01:16:42.680 --> 01:16:47.000]  conspirators or we're lifers there was a new term called lifers and then death
[01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:52.680]  there's and when I said myself my god these boys are really really reaching
[01:16:52.680 --> 01:16:57.760]  and we did that reaching out in desperation because every time you try
[01:16:57.760 --> 01:17:03.040]  to niche our public that the Alex Jones public or the American public or you
[01:17:03.040 --> 01:17:07.760]  Alex or me by saying I'm a conspirator it really doesn't work and what happens
[01:17:07.760 --> 01:17:12.160]  is they expose themselves as I told you on the first show weeks ago they're
[01:17:12.160 --> 01:17:16.200]  putting themselves out and I watch where they're shooting and I knew exactly how
[01:17:16.200 --> 01:17:18.920]  they're going to come back and I told you they're going to come back and call
[01:17:18.920 --> 01:17:24.280]  us cookie crazy alleged conspirators you saw in that article MSNBC well
[01:17:24.280 --> 01:17:29.320]  reporters don't have the intelligence or the ability to really spend time on
[01:17:29.320 --> 01:17:33.880]  these issues most of them are young kids or most of them are using blogs and
[01:17:33.880 --> 01:17:37.720]  most of them are just picking up and they've just literally receptacles to
[01:17:37.720 --> 01:17:43.320]  which you know well doc I want to stop you and and back you up on that these
[01:17:43.320 --> 01:17:50.880]  Atlantic monthly articles the MSNBC the Forbes there are spelling errors name
[01:17:50.880 --> 01:18:00.160]  errors they put in Forbes that you had said that that Obama the Obama killing
[01:18:00.160 --> 01:18:08.280]  wasn't real and when it was bin Laden killing and they're they're getting rid
[01:18:08.280 --> 01:18:12.760]  of all the real journalists and hiring mindless yes men and this is drivel that
[01:18:12.760 --> 01:18:16.680]  you would expect an eight eighth grade school newspaper to be putting out I
[01:18:16.680 --> 01:18:21.560]  agree with you Alex really what it is is it's nothing to do with us quite
[01:18:21.560 --> 01:18:25.600]  frankly I'm very proud to be on your show and I'm proud that American public is
[01:18:25.600 --> 01:18:31.520]  forcing the illiteracy of the media the mainstream media to come out with the
[01:18:31.520 --> 01:18:36.480]  most absurd comments poorly written you and I know they extremely poorly written
[01:18:36.480 --> 01:18:42.080]  and they're talking about issues now about military dogs that are involved in
[01:18:42.080 --> 01:18:46.680]  Afghanistan well you know if you have nothing else to talk about while
[01:18:46.680 --> 01:18:51.080]  Bahrain is falling serious falling people are being killed in the thousands
[01:18:51.080 --> 01:18:55.720]  and you really don't know how to analyze this and you don't know what to say you
[01:18:55.720 --> 01:18:59.440]  have really second-rate writers and second-rate well that's cheap
[01:18:59.440 --> 01:19:05.040]  psychological warfare our culture by the way these are the Mcdonald brains of

[01:24:21.040 --> 01:24:25.840]  mind spy master dr. Steve Pachennick wrote the book for the state department on
[01:24:25.840 --> 01:24:31.040]  psychological warfare you know I was reading Goebbels more than a decade ago
[01:24:31.040 --> 01:24:36.480]  doctor and he was talking when when Germany was being bombed it was 1944
[01:24:36.480 --> 01:24:40.080]  they were really losing and Goebbels said we got to change our propaganda the
[01:24:40.080 --> 01:24:44.600]  Germans will do whatever we tell them but this stuff is too ridiculous it was
[01:24:44.600 --> 01:24:48.640]  almost like Baghdad Bob out there saying the Americans are nowhere near Baghdad
[01:24:48.640 --> 01:24:53.240]  and you see explosions a mile behind him and US helicopters flying behind him
[01:24:53.240 --> 01:24:56.400]  the Germans were saying there's no problem we're not being bombed and
[01:24:56.400 --> 01:25:01.000]  Goebbels said look we've got to get more reality-based and I think the ham
[01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:06.000]  fisted Psyops that these criminals are running are becoming so
[01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:11.680]  cartoonish that they may be fooling some of the dumber segments but most people I
[01:25:11.680 --> 01:25:15.640]  know in the polls I've seen people are not buying it dumping the body in the
[01:25:15.640 --> 01:25:19.440]  sea all of this and I want you to comment on their ham fisted tactics
[01:25:19.440 --> 01:25:26.800]  doctor but before you do that let's get into MSNBC trying to demonize you but
[01:25:26.800 --> 01:25:34.040]  then going to experts who they read in Salon and others in 2001 2002 and other
[01:25:34.040 --> 01:25:41.200]  publications they MSNBC called Dr. Richard Devereaux and others and he
[01:25:41.200 --> 01:25:44.520]  said I'm not gonna talk about it he said I don't want to continue to get calls
[01:25:44.520 --> 01:25:50.200]  about this but he said yes he is a Marfanoid he has the disorder he had it
[01:25:50.200 --> 01:25:54.600]  he had it back then there's no doubt and they say so that confirms what
[01:25:54.600 --> 01:26:02.200]  Pachining has to say but still they make fun of you and myself I mean explaining
[01:26:02.200 --> 01:26:07.200]  for people this is ten years ago he's on record at a hospital almost dead now
[01:26:07.200 --> 01:26:11.040]  you saw him before that when you were working with him in the 80s I met him
[01:26:11.040 --> 01:26:14.200]  once you said he looked ill then doctor you're a medical doctor have two
[01:26:14.200 --> 01:26:17.960]  medical degrees right I mean I was looking you up you were you write some
[01:26:17.960 --> 01:26:21.960]  of the most prestigious medical reports in the country co-author them that have
[01:26:21.960 --> 01:26:26.440]  won national awards just recently here you are saying he's got this the media
[01:26:26.440 --> 01:26:33.680]  goes out to demonize you and then talks to the top expert on this disease they
[01:26:33.680 --> 01:26:38.160]  admit that top doctor confirms bin Laden had Marfan syndrome they admit you
[01:26:38.160 --> 01:26:41.960]  can't live very long with this plus he had total kidney failure you can't live
[01:26:41.960 --> 01:26:44.960]  more than six years with that on average but we're to believe he's in a
[01:26:44.960 --> 01:26:50.000]  squalid cesspit with no dialysis equipment can you walk through this
[01:26:50.000 --> 01:26:56.200]  fairy-tale doctor yeah but what happened is you you invoked a garing let me
[01:26:56.200 --> 01:27:01.800]  invoke a man in 1945 a German senior official next to garing who was asked
[01:27:01.800 --> 01:27:06.360]  the following question by three American judges he was asked how did you
[01:27:06.360 --> 01:27:11.560]  mobilize 35 million people to go to war his response was it's very simple
[01:27:11.560 --> 01:27:15.760]  whether your democracy whether your communism or whether you're not a Nazi
[01:27:15.760 --> 01:27:20.520]  yeah and nationalism it's a it's very simple what you do is you create an
[01:27:20.520 --> 01:27:25.600]  attack a false flag attack then you say whoever attacked us as the enemy and
[01:27:25.600 --> 01:27:29.840]  whoever's with us against the enemy is a patriot well that's what happened in
[01:27:29.840 --> 01:27:34.120]  9-11 and the man who was asked that question was garing the head of the
[01:27:34.120 --> 01:27:37.760]  Air Force he subsequently committed suicide and that was in front of the
[01:27:37.760 --> 01:27:42.840]  Commission and our prosecutors in the Nuremberg trial so the technique is an
[01:27:42.840 --> 01:27:47.680]  old technique of trying to demonize and create the wearer than the Patriots in
[01:27:47.680 --> 01:27:51.800]  the United States when and anybody against them are enemies now when you
[01:27:51.800 --> 01:27:58.560]  try to portray anybody get me or what I am or what I was it gets very hard when
[01:27:58.560 --> 01:28:03.720]  the beginning of the lie is a lie that's so obvious you can't really change it
[01:28:03.720 --> 01:28:07.840]  and then once you create the sly where he had morphine syndrome it's been
[01:28:07.840 --> 01:28:13.080]  corroborated by many people that's a less to get me but others Madeline Albright
[01:28:13.080 --> 01:28:18.120]  and others you continue with a story line over nine to ten years over
[01:28:18.120 --> 01:28:22.200]  different bureaucracies you have to remember there's no continuity in the
[01:28:22.200 --> 01:28:28.160]  CIA since that time nine ten years ago I was suspect about a good majority of the
[01:28:28.160 --> 01:28:32.080]  CIA operatives went out and went into other private businesses which they
[01:28:32.080 --> 01:28:36.960]  normally should do and many of them came back and we have probably 70 80% of
[01:28:36.960 --> 01:28:44.320]  those who came back are on contract in nature 128 or or or Beltway Band-Aids
[01:28:44.320 --> 01:28:48.960]  like North of Grumman, Bowling, L3 communication corporations where their
[01:28:48.960 --> 01:28:52.960]  loyalty is not to the United States of America their loyalty is to the Bay
[01:28:52.960 --> 01:28:57.960]  Check and they will be thrown out eventually and with Petraeus coming in
[01:28:57.960 --> 01:29:02.560]  hopefully General Petraeus he will get rid of a lot of these issues and then in
[01:29:02.560 --> 01:29:06.400]  the compartmentalized nature now what happens with somebody like me who's
[01:29:06.400 --> 01:29:10.680]  been in the administration in and out by the way I received no pension I didn't
[01:29:10.680 --> 01:29:15.040]  receive you know I've received very little money I came in as a consultant I
[01:29:15.040 --> 01:29:19.920]  was not a civil servant I sometimes had a military rank I volunteered for most
[01:29:19.920 --> 01:29:24.920]  assignments and I left I was on line probably six to seven eight times with
[01:29:24.920 --> 01:29:29.000]  my life doctor doctor this is a short segment long 18-minute segment coming
[01:29:29.000 --> 01:29:32.680]  up stay there we're gonna come back and break this down but specifically how
[01:29:32.680 --> 01:29:40.480]  long could you live with this disease why wasn't there dialysis equipment and
[01:29:40.480 --> 01:29:43.800]  and then we'll leave them in a lot in situation and get into other big issues
[01:29:43.800 --> 01:29:51.880]  but and they put out new fake videos that were old videos we're on the March
[01:29:51.880 --> 01:30:01.600]  the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network a very wealthy

[01:34:18.280 --> 01:34:21.440]  a college tuition bubble here in America being fueled by the government's

[01:35:35.080 --> 01:35:43.040]  is StevePacinac.com Pacinac spelled P I E C Z E N I K and going back to Dr.
[01:35:43.040 --> 01:35:46.160]  Pacinac I was talking to Dr. Pacinac and I said look I know you don't like to
[01:35:46.160 --> 01:35:50.160]  toot your horn and about how you said he had Marfan's the kidney failure it's on
[01:35:50.160 --> 01:35:53.600]  record now they're having to admit it it's impossible he could still be alive
[01:35:53.600 --> 01:35:57.520]  ten years later and he said look Alex I don't want to get caught up in their
[01:35:57.520 --> 01:36:02.320]  fake narrative when it's an overall lie a lot of times and I agree with them they
[01:36:02.320 --> 01:36:07.520]  put out ridiculous disinfo as a tactic to then make you debate the little lies
[01:36:07.520 --> 01:36:13.240]  as if the overall stories true I get that but but but still sir as a
[01:36:13.240 --> 01:36:16.480]  psychological warfare chief somebody that analyzed foreign government's
[01:36:16.480 --> 01:36:19.360]  psychological warfare somebody who launched these things on other
[01:36:19.360 --> 01:36:22.440]  governments somebody who wrote you know the book for this on the State
[01:36:22.440 --> 01:36:26.840]  Department you know the guy that is the top advisor to Tom Clancy you know you
[01:36:26.840 --> 01:36:32.680]  you're the inside guy to make his books so credible let's go over no dialysis
[01:36:32.680 --> 01:36:38.560]  machine in the hovel that was a palace not shooting in a 40 minute firefight not
[01:36:38.560 --> 01:36:43.280]  having the wife not producing the wife throwing the body into the ocean the
[01:36:43.280 --> 01:36:49.040]  Marfan's the you said it last Tuesday two days before they came out and said
[01:36:49.040 --> 01:36:53.600]  that's a fake situation room photo that stage that isn't how it works it's not
[01:36:53.600 --> 01:36:57.160]  real I've been in on those things and then they come out two days later and go
[01:36:57.160 --> 01:37:00.960]  yeah it was fake they weren't watching any video feed they posed for the photo I
[01:37:00.960 --> 01:37:04.280]  mean you but a hundred percent right you're being demonized by thousands of
[01:37:04.280 --> 01:37:08.120]  publications proving that you're on target you're over the target getting
[01:37:08.120 --> 01:37:12.440]  the flak so break down the ridiculousness of it and then we'll get into all
[01:37:12.440 --> 01:37:16.680]  the other facets let me go on over the list first of all the mansion that they
[01:37:16.680 --> 01:37:21.200]  attacked by the way the mansion so before all of the propaganda had to do
[01:37:21.200 --> 01:37:25.080]  with the fact that this tall six-foot-four individual was carrying
[01:37:25.080 --> 01:37:28.600]  around presumed carrying around a dialysis machine now everybody in your
[01:37:28.600 --> 01:37:32.880]  audience knows this weighs a lot and you can't carry it through Afghanistan and
[01:37:32.880 --> 01:37:36.800]  Turoboros that was the former story narrative up to the time of this
[01:37:36.800 --> 01:37:41.880]  assault that's somewhere and you can check it out he was hidden he Osama was
[01:37:41.880 --> 01:37:46.400]  hidden along with four areas of position is number two and in the mountains of
[01:37:46.400 --> 01:37:50.600]  Afghanistan and Pakistan and those and in the president said we couldn't find
[01:37:50.600 --> 01:37:55.960]  him now in ten years a six-foot-four giant with Martin syndrome walking around
[01:37:55.960 --> 01:38:02.040]  with a huge real dialysis machine which requires all kinds of ancillary
[01:38:02.040 --> 01:38:06.560]  assisted is running around them at the mountains of the Pakistan which I've
[01:38:06.560 --> 01:38:11.320]  been in and Afghanistan and his tearing this and lives in a cave but I but
[01:38:11.320 --> 01:38:16.200]  presumably was subsequently attacked in this beautiful mansion where he was
[01:38:16.200 --> 01:38:20.120]  living at six years without anybody knowing I mean that's an inherent
[01:38:20.120 --> 01:38:26.680]  contradiction now not only is this mansion next to a major city but more
[01:38:26.680 --> 01:38:31.280]  importantly I want everybody to imagine what the West Point Academy looks like
[01:38:31.280 --> 01:38:35.440]  at the beautiful Academy I've taught there from time to time I've given
[01:38:35.440 --> 01:38:39.560]  lectures it's a beautifully located on the Hudson but that's the equivalent of
[01:38:39.560 --> 01:38:43.520]  the Pakistan Military Institute so I want everything about you to imagine that
[01:38:43.520 --> 01:38:49.200]  about a couple hundred feet from West Point Academy we found Osama bin Laden
[01:38:49.200 --> 01:38:54.160]  dead in this beautiful mansion where we have all kinds of soldiers monitoring
[01:38:54.160 --> 01:38:59.600]  the entire area we have aerial satellites we have all kinds of aerial
[01:38:59.600 --> 01:39:03.880]  satellites and believe me our boys are extremely good particularly in the army
[01:39:03.880 --> 01:39:07.520]  they're extremely good I don't want to tell which divisions I've worked with
[01:39:07.520 --> 01:39:11.640]  them they're smart they're right on target and if you can't tell me that
[01:39:11.640 --> 01:39:16.000]  they couldn't understand that there was Osama bin Laden couple hundred feet away
[01:39:16.000 --> 01:39:22.200]  from our comparable part of our West Point that's absurd then we get to the
[01:39:22.200 --> 01:39:27.680]  fact that they buried Osama bin Laden in the sea which is not according to Muslim
[01:39:27.680 --> 01:39:31.920]  culture all of my colleagues and friends who are Muslim understand that
[01:39:31.920 --> 01:39:38.080]  first you bury them on the land and his face must point to Mecca it must point
[01:39:38.080 --> 01:39:43.040]  to Mecca you do not throw him in the water so whoever developed the narrative
[01:39:43.040 --> 01:39:48.360]  didn't know once logistical and tactical issues really did not understand what
[01:39:48.360 --> 01:39:54.560]  our capabilities are in the sky on the ground and really belittled in many ways
[01:39:54.560 --> 01:39:59.240]  what what I found a sense of isn't that we're a demonized or I'm demonized I
[01:39:59.240 --> 01:40:04.360]  don't give you know who whether I'm demonized I give a hood that our
[01:40:04.360 --> 01:40:09.440]  intelligence community is being demonized by inference because whoever
[01:40:09.440 --> 01:40:14.400]  created this story and I can guarantee you it's not people I work with who are
[01:40:14.400 --> 01:40:18.920]  in in army units and elsewhere and I won't identify them they're exceedingly
[01:40:18.920 --> 01:40:24.080]  bright they have many master's degrees they have a great sense of humor and I
[01:40:24.080 --> 01:40:27.800]  know they're laughing at what's happening right now and these are brave men and
[01:40:27.800 --> 01:40:34.080]  women who are sacrificing their lives and this is offensive to my my colleagues
[01:40:34.080 --> 01:40:38.680]  who working right now and dying for us getting a story where by the way the
[01:40:38.680 --> 01:40:42.800]  seals which I have had respectful but they've had a history of some problems
[01:40:42.800 --> 01:40:51.240]  have come from a land-based area and fly into this so-called mortuary well
[01:40:51.240 --> 01:40:56.320]  it's really a mortuary and attack Osama bin Laden shoot him in the face now the
[01:40:56.320 --> 01:41:00.640]  story gets so out of proportion that not only does it become ridiculous but
[01:41:00.640 --> 01:41:05.440]  listen to this one Alex within days of the time that you and I talked I think
[01:41:05.440 --> 01:41:09.760]  it was two three days ago there were two books about the seals in the New York
[01:41:09.760 --> 01:41:15.120]  Times now tell me that isn't proficient timing and I told my colleagues in the
[01:41:15.120 --> 01:41:18.360]  intelligence community you better inform those who are creating this
[01:41:18.360 --> 01:41:23.040]  narrative this is out of control you can't suddenly and it was one of the
[01:41:23.040 --> 01:41:28.200]  great intellectual literary editors of the New York Times I forget her name it's
[01:41:28.200 --> 01:41:32.400]  a Japanese last name but Bill Keller of the New York Times is the managing
[01:41:32.400 --> 01:41:37.360]  director should be absolutely ashamed but ashamed that he's being manipulated
[01:41:37.360 --> 01:41:43.640]  and used to produce two incredible with so-called autobiographies of the seals
[01:41:43.640 --> 01:41:48.840]  and just about the time that the seals were propagating and self-aggrandizing
[01:41:48.840 --> 01:41:53.240]  them on TV let me stop you there two more books come the world of
[01:41:53.240 --> 01:41:58.800]  intelligence this is so egregiously inappropriate that all my colleagues at
[01:41:58.800 --> 01:42:02.920]  the association of former intelligence officers which I belong to the
[01:42:02.920 --> 01:42:06.840]  national military intelligence agency which I belong to and other
[01:42:06.840 --> 01:42:11.160]  intelligence groups we're looking at this and my colleagues are saying this
[01:42:11.160 --> 01:42:16.280]  is bizarre and this is an affront to the intelligence community because it makes
[01:42:16.280 --> 01:42:20.360]  them sound as if they're stupid they're not what's stupid here are the
[01:42:20.360 --> 01:42:24.440]  civilians who are running this show particularly Mr. Donlin who was a
[01:42:24.440 --> 01:42:28.680]  lobbyist and the so-called national security advisor has no idea what he's
[01:42:28.680 --> 01:42:32.520]  talking about he's a national security advisor to Obama but guess what he was
[01:42:32.520 --> 01:42:39.760]  Alex he was a lobbyist for Fannie Mae between 1999 and 2005 now you know Fannie
[01:42:39.760 --> 01:42:44.320]  Mae was corrupt and you're telling me that our national security advisor who's
[01:42:44.320 --> 01:42:49.600]  basically a lawyer went to second grade schools not quality schools and maybe
[01:42:49.600 --> 01:42:54.600]  you don't agree with him but certainly was not very capable and his sister and
[01:42:54.600 --> 01:43:00.360]  one of his brothers the advisor to Biden and he is married to chief of staff of
[01:43:00.360 --> 01:43:05.520]  Biden now what we have here is a little cabala of incompetency on the civilian
[01:43:05.520 --> 01:43:11.000]  side in the White House which is mandated in amazing intelligence capability
[01:43:11.000 --> 01:43:16.160]  that we have and they're telling them what to do it's not unlike Bush Jr. who
[01:43:16.160 --> 01:43:20.640]  wasn't very bright and said that we had weapons of mass destruction and many of
[01:43:20.640 --> 01:43:24.000]  our people in the intelligence community said you don't know what you're talking
[01:43:24.000 --> 01:43:27.760]  about and particularly in the military intelligence said forget it we're not
[01:43:27.760 --> 01:43:31.440]  even following let me stop you doctor let me stop you like channel portray us
[01:43:31.440 --> 01:43:36.360]  that he didn't listen to Jerry Bremer this neocon and a lot of the men I work
[01:43:36.360 --> 01:43:42.320]  with in the units of special forces and other units said get out of here the
[01:43:42.320 --> 01:43:45.560]  cons and now I'm saying to our intelligence community in the military
[01:43:45.560 --> 01:43:49.840]  tell Donlin to leave and tell the president he better get a new national
[01:43:49.840 --> 01:43:54.040]  security team because this is out of control all right dr. Pachennick people's
[01:43:54.040 --> 01:43:57.880]  out of control yes sir dr. Pachennick I want to break down all the incredible
[01:43:57.880 --> 01:44:00.280]  information you're bringing out but the point you're making a few minutes ago
[01:44:00.280 --> 01:44:05.520]  and correct me if I'm wrong is that when you're getting fired at in propaganda
[01:44:05.520 --> 01:44:10.760]  or with actual lead that is a way to see where the enemy is and they open up on
[01:44:10.760 --> 01:44:16.080]  you immediately that's evidence that it's staged and so you have the roll out
[01:44:16.080 --> 01:44:20.440]  of the new alert system the roll out of the new campaign the roll out of the
[01:44:20.440 --> 01:44:26.320]  demonization of Pakistan the roll out of all this pre bin Laden hype that if you
[01:44:26.320 --> 01:44:31.920]  kill him he's going to nuke you in the AP two weeks before out of Guantanamo Bay
[01:44:31.920 --> 01:44:37.960]  you can see all the prescripting ahead of time showing even more evidence and
[01:44:37.960 --> 01:44:43.840]  now you have the Navy seal books all perfectly timed a full PR drive obviously
[01:44:43.840 --> 01:44:47.520]  set up at least a year ago but I want to go over some other points that we
[01:44:47.520 --> 01:44:51.520]  haven't brought up to you you have the ultimate intelligence cash you have the
[01:44:51.520 --> 01:44:56.920]  mastermind of Al Qaeda with the buried nukes in America the government saying
[01:44:56.920 --> 01:45:02.040]  they've got nukes total you know Easter Bunny made up they're going to get us but
[01:45:02.040 --> 01:45:07.120]  first they say he resisted no he didn't we executed him we killed him once we
[01:45:07.120 --> 01:45:12.520]  drug him out so they kill the ultimate intelligence source so even if you
[01:45:12.520 --> 01:45:16.360]  believe the official story they wanted to cover up his CIA history I want you to
[01:45:16.360 --> 01:45:19.920]  speak to killing the greatest intelligence catch but then it gets worse
[01:45:19.920 --> 01:45:24.360]  they tell us we have eight hard drives we know what Al Qaeda was going to hit
[01:45:24.360 --> 01:45:29.200]  now if it was real and they really have the intelligence they would say the
[01:45:29.200 --> 01:45:33.240]  place burned up in fact they would they would torch the place and say
[01:45:33.240 --> 01:45:37.320]  everything burned up we didn't get intelligence so all the fake Al Qaeda
[01:45:37.320 --> 01:45:42.560]  networks if they were real wouldn't be tipped I mean that's basic police basic
[01:45:42.560 --> 01:45:46.760]  intelligence so can you speak to killing the great intelligence cash is what
[01:45:46.760 --> 01:45:50.040]  they are thinking now what I'm thinking but this is the way we're going the
[01:45:50.040 --> 01:45:54.680]  psychological warfare the reason they're creating in part this story that's
[01:45:54.680 --> 01:46:00.040]  nonsensical and it's becoming even more absurd is that in their mind not my mind
[01:46:00.040 --> 01:46:04.360]  or your mind in their mind that if they said listen we found the hard drives we
[01:46:04.360 --> 01:46:09.000]  found the fast drives we found all this intelligence in their mind they're
[01:46:09.000 --> 01:46:13.920]  assuming the intelligence community that all the other Al Qaeda units particularly
[01:46:13.920 --> 01:46:20.800]  in the MN and in North Africa will be fearful that they can be tracked down
[01:46:20.800 --> 01:46:25.120]  that just doesn't work number one every Al Qaeda member and a few that are
[01:46:25.120 --> 01:46:31.120]  remaining by the way knows that Osama bin Laden was not into really in charge of
[01:46:31.120 --> 01:46:36.160]  anything operation money that was just money is no no we didn't even have
[01:46:36.160 --> 01:46:40.800]  money he's not going to be really had really no operational effect of it I
[01:46:40.800 --> 01:46:44.720]  don't think there's one person honestly in the intelligence community who
[01:46:44.720 --> 01:46:48.640]  despite giving this nonsensical story will tell you there you go he was a
[01:46:48.640 --> 01:46:52.440]  strategic importance you just dropped another bombshell hold on you just
[01:46:52.440 --> 01:46:56.520]  dropped another bombshell exactly it's admitted he was only a figurehead
[01:46:56.520 --> 01:47:02.360]  okay no no I mean hadn't had money in a long time wasn't running anything so
[01:47:02.360 --> 01:47:06.800]  that proves it's another lie claiming all the operational plans were there on
[01:47:06.800 --> 01:47:11.040]  these computers that's correct I mean that there was basically this is what
[01:47:11.040 --> 01:47:16.600]  we call in the psyops world at times but the turns to try to frighten whatever
[01:47:16.600 --> 01:47:20.400]  potential terrorists may or may not be out there but you have to think for a
[01:47:20.400 --> 01:47:25.600]  moment our military has effectively killed let's say 2000 so-called Al Qaeda
[01:47:25.600 --> 01:47:31.840]  members in Afghanistan at the price of $50 million per Al Qaeda you remember
[01:47:31.840 --> 01:47:36.360]  that's a lot of money and that has not been effective so the overall goal of
[01:47:36.360 --> 01:47:40.560]  civil society and the president's notion that we should have love and kumbaya
[01:47:40.560 --> 01:47:44.760]  and understanding get rid of corruption and by the way this is quite
[01:47:44.760 --> 01:47:49.200]  interesting given a man who came from a very corrupt city like Chicago going out
[01:47:49.200 --> 01:47:52.120]  internationally and say we really should get rid of corruption around the
[01:47:52.120 --> 01:47:58.200]  world what in fact has happened is that we have really institutionalized military
[01:47:58.200 --> 01:48:03.000]  control in the Middle East that is when we took out Mubarak and I was involved
[01:48:03.000 --> 01:48:10.600]  with Mubarak and Sadat before we really institutionalized military control and
[01:48:10.600 --> 01:48:15.120]  what's happening now in Libya is that we're supporting military control as
[01:48:15.120 --> 01:48:19.720]  well contrary to what they say we're bringing in the Egyptian special forces
[01:48:19.720 --> 01:48:24.240]  we have special forces there we have CIA operatives which he had to admit the
[01:48:24.240 --> 01:48:28.360]  truth of the matter is this entire program isn't just from the intelligence
[01:48:28.360 --> 01:48:32.320]  point of view this is very low level on the intelligence and from the strategic
[01:48:32.320 --> 01:48:37.120]  point of view this is not working at all and he has no idea so Ben Rhodes he's
[01:48:37.120 --> 01:48:41.160]  writing a speech a very ineffectual foreign policy man who just basically
[01:48:41.160 --> 01:48:46.800]  his political act is trying to integrate the so-called killing of Osama bin
[01:48:46.800 --> 01:48:51.000]  Laden which is not true and what it means for the Middle East which he has no
[01:48:51.000 --> 01:48:55.120]  idea because our intelligence community never picked up the notion that one
[01:48:55.120 --> 01:49:00.360]  poor man could put himself on fire in Tunisia and set off a riot in Egypt and
[01:49:00.360 --> 01:49:06.200]  then subsequent in Libya in Bahrain our real war and the military and our men
[01:49:06.200 --> 01:49:10.840]  who are on the ground understand that our real war has nothing to do with Osama
[01:49:10.840 --> 01:49:15.440]  bin Laden that's just what we call a distraction our real issue is a fight
[01:49:15.440 --> 01:49:21.200]  with Iran right now in Bahrain and in Syria where he's Iran and that is helping
[01:49:21.200 --> 01:49:25.720]  the Syrians to suppress many of the dissidents and this is what's going on
[01:49:25.720 --> 01:49:30.400]  but if we dissect every element of it what you see right now is you have a
[01:49:30.400 --> 01:49:35.640]  civilian government again in the White House who's really not qualified to run
[01:49:35.640 --> 01:49:40.400]  into national affairs but get domestic affairs because this guy Tom Donlan was
[01:49:40.400 --> 01:49:44.520]  part of the corruption of Fannie Mae and how he could have been appointed a
[01:49:44.520 --> 01:49:48.840]  national security advisor a corrupt individual who was a lobbyist for
[01:49:48.840 --> 01:49:52.760]  corrupt institution as you know and you've talked about it before Fannie Mae
[01:49:52.760 --> 01:49:57.680]  tells the American president and America this is what we should be
[01:49:57.680 --> 01:50:02.360]  believing while his wife is working for Biden who also is not the swiftest
[01:50:02.360 --> 01:50:06.120]  individual in the world you have to remember this is the man who plagiarized
[01:50:06.120 --> 01:50:10.920]  many of his speeches long ago and has a problem with the few aneurysms in his
[01:50:10.920 --> 01:50:16.240]  head and now this is what we have controlling the American public telling
[01:50:16.240 --> 01:50:21.840]  us we who they consider as dumb rummies who have to make a living who have to
[01:50:21.840 --> 01:50:26.880]  take two jobs who have to go to school as you said at a very expensive school
[01:50:26.880 --> 01:50:32.760]  systems that are ripping us off and we have to say listen it's enough take
[01:50:32.760 --> 01:50:36.760]  your incompetency take your nonsense and get the hell out of here because we
[01:50:36.760 --> 01:50:41.080]  have to have a living in the major national security problem that every
[01:50:41.080 --> 01:50:44.600]  one of my generals knows and every one of my intelligence colleagues understand
[01:50:44.600 --> 01:50:50.760]  is the national debt it is not Osama it is not anything else but the national
[01:50:50.760 --> 01:50:55.000]  debt all right dr. Pachinik we've got a break come back and I want to look at
[01:50:55.000 --> 01:51:00.200]  what the banking system is doing and what the Chicago mafia is mishandling and
[01:51:00.200 --> 01:51:04.040]  where you see things going radioactive fallout the number one way by which your
[01:51:04.040 --> 01:51:08.240]  body protects itself from radiation or any other free radical is with glutathione
[01:51:08.240 --> 01:51:11.920]  glutathione is the most ubiquitous antioxidant in the body the number one
[01:51:11.920 --> 01:51:15.720]  mechanism for removing toxic elements from the body is glutathione in order
[01:51:15.720 --> 01:51:19.360]  for your body to make optimal levels of glutathione it needs an abundance of the
[01:51:19.360 --> 01:51:24.600]  amino acid cysteine the highest dietary source of cysteine is non denatured
[01:51:24.600 --> 01:51:29.160]  whey protein powder from grass-fed cows the most non denatured whey protein

[01:54:24.160 --> 01:54:26.960]  is fine that tends to limit my interruptions but I have a lot of
[01:54:26.960 --> 01:54:30.880]  questions I want to get to I want to get to Libya his view on what's happening
[01:54:30.880 --> 01:54:34.640]  there where he thinks this whole geopolitical system's going that what's
[01:54:34.640 --> 01:54:38.080]  happening in the banking system the economy and how to take America back

[01:54:55.400 --> 01:54:58.400]  the air and by the way first-time callers I want to do that today first-time
[01:54:58.400 --> 01:55:05.040]  callers for Dr. Steve Pachennick 800-259-9231 I'd love to hear from military
[01:55:05.040 --> 01:55:09.000]  people in black ops retired he was talking about most his colleagues
[01:55:09.000 --> 01:55:13.080]  formerly intelligence are currently just say this is embarrassing us this is
[01:55:13.080 --> 01:55:16.920]  going to discredit everybody this is this is too obvious you got a Chicago
[01:55:16.920 --> 01:55:21.120]  New York mafia that are used to always winning and they're not even using
[01:55:21.120 --> 01:55:25.800]  professionals for their lives and that's why it's gotten so cartoonish but but I
[01:55:25.800 --> 01:55:29.640]  was saying doc you didn't get into the point of inwardly the fable of that they
[01:55:29.640 --> 01:55:35.520]  just killed him why if he didn't resist capture him and get the intel and you
[01:55:35.520 --> 01:55:41.000]  answered it very succinctly or what I said is basically when they want when
[01:55:41.000 --> 01:55:45.600]  the intelligence community wants to show that they can kill Osama bin Laden
[01:55:45.600 --> 01:55:49.000]  they're basically transmitting the message all over the world to potential
[01:55:49.000 --> 01:55:53.400]  terrorists that we can kill you no matter where you are where you think you can
[01:55:53.400 --> 01:55:57.240]  hide we'll always find you and we will kill you also we know where you are
[01:55:57.240 --> 01:56:04.280]  because of the ostensible information we got from the Osama bin Laden compound
[01:56:04.280 --> 01:56:09.680]  so that's the psyops level of that in terms of the warning threatening and
[01:56:09.680 --> 01:56:14.880]  explaining that we're gonna hunt you down no matter where you are now doc how
[01:56:14.880 --> 01:56:20.440]  does that square with 9-11 being a false flag and Amar al-Alaqi born in the
[01:56:20.440 --> 01:56:25.360]  U.S. admittedly hanging out the Pentagon Adam Gadan the fake videos four of the
[01:56:25.360 --> 01:56:30.640]  new five were old videos as compounds what the problem of the narrative is
[01:56:30.640 --> 01:56:34.440]  when when you started it it should have stopped under the Bush junior
[01:56:34.440 --> 01:56:37.880]  administration and I think at some point somebody there would have been smart
[01:56:37.880 --> 01:56:42.560]  enough to say okay we found Osama bin Laden but from the psyops point of view
[01:56:42.560 --> 01:56:47.840]  they needed that story they being the administration continuity narrative
[01:56:47.840 --> 01:56:53.320]  needed the story of Osama bin Laden to be alive so that they could justify our
[01:56:53.320 --> 01:56:58.400]  military presence and Afghanistan and you would hear Bush you said no we're
[01:56:58.400 --> 01:57:02.160]  still out there Osama's there I'm gonna get him well he didn't get him in that
[01:57:02.160 --> 01:57:06.000]  bravado kind of tone and it was clear you know Bush junior was not very
[01:57:06.000 --> 01:57:10.400]  qualified to get anything let alone his own position but then Osama then
[01:57:10.400 --> 01:57:16.160]  Obama comes in and says yes we'll hunt them down and once we hunt them down we
[01:57:16.160 --> 01:57:22.840]  will leave Afghanistan well low and behold they are leaving Afghanistan and
[01:57:22.840 --> 01:57:26.720]  propitiously as we say in the intelligence community suddenly we found
[01:57:26.720 --> 01:57:31.680]  Osama bin Laden and we killed him well the propitious element of the
[01:57:31.680 --> 01:57:37.000]  political expediency is the fact that they used this dead body and narrative
[01:57:37.000 --> 01:57:42.600]  in order to justify the exit from Afghanistan and Pakistan in that
[01:57:42.600 --> 01:57:47.360]  process which is really a tactical issue Osama bin Laden death has no relevance
[01:57:47.360 --> 01:57:52.120]  to our strategic position none whatsoever our real strategic position is the
[01:57:52.120 --> 01:57:55.920]  withdrawal from Pakistan without creating any trouble which we have now
[01:57:55.920 --> 01:58:00.960]  compounded very seriously one thanks to Panetta who is using this I've been
[01:58:00.960 --> 01:58:04.080]  using drones and killing a lot of civilians with a lot of collateral
[01:58:04.080 --> 01:58:09.440]  damage secondly because the relationship between the CIA which created the ISI
[01:58:09.440 --> 01:58:14.800]  years ago while I was in the administration has been absolutely
[01:58:14.800 --> 01:58:20.520]  horrendous and the Pakistanis have used and been used and so right now there's
[01:58:20.520 --> 01:58:24.760]  a relationship that's going on it's in a marriage that I would characterize like
[01:58:24.760 --> 01:58:29.560]  a sadomasochistic relationship the Pakistanis say hit me hit me and then
[01:58:29.560 --> 01:58:34.480]  they hit me and then they go back and they hit the IS the CIA and the CIA says
[01:58:34.480 --> 01:58:38.560]  why did you hit me and they hit them back is this ongoing game that goes on stay
[01:58:38.560 --> 01:58:52.960]  there got a break got a break doc this is Alex Jones with five good reasons you
[01:58:52.960 --> 01:58:56.840]  should consider buying a solar power generator number one new climate
[01:58:56.840 --> 01:59:00.600]  legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill number two our
[01:59:00.600 --> 01:59:04.520]  new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company allows
[01:59:04.520 --> 01:59:08.920]  you to have it's true total government control of electricity in the name of
[01:59:08.920 --> 01:59:13.360]  smart grid technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the
[01:59:13.360 --> 01:59:18.120]  power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only
[01:59:18.120 --> 01:59:21.920]  compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to
[01:59:21.920 --> 01:59:25.560]  local grids every year thousands of families lose their power from weather
[01:59:25.560 --> 01:59:29.920]  related onages number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup
[01:59:29.920 --> 01:59:33.080]  insurance and peace of mind folks I really believe in the solar power
[01:59:33.080 --> 01:59:36.760]  generators offered by solutions from science one of my oldest sponsors you

[02:00:48.800 --> 02:00:54.520]  Goldman Sachs JP Morgan and others nesting in the White House Obama
[02:00:54.520 --> 02:01:02.240]  fiddling while Rome burns but but but finishing up with bin Laden what doctor
[02:01:02.240 --> 02:01:05.920]  from a psychological warfare perspective going into their minds what were
[02:01:05.920 --> 02:01:09.600]  they thinking when they did fake situation room photos what were they
[02:01:09.600 --> 02:01:13.560]  thinking when they wrote up this shoddy plan I mean was it meant to be so shoddy
[02:01:13.560 --> 02:01:18.480]  that people would then debate the shoddy details of the larger issue or is it as
[02:01:18.480 --> 02:01:25.160]  bad as it appears you're saying and these people are just amateurs they've got
[02:01:25.160 --> 02:01:29.440]  the power they're leaning on the fact that they're in control and they think
[02:01:29.440 --> 02:01:34.200]  the public is done I mean what's what's going on here why did they do this well
[02:01:34.200 --> 02:01:41.640]  number one they do it in order to create a narrative to to warn the other
[02:01:41.640 --> 02:01:47.080]  potential terrorists around the world that they are today being a unit for the
[02:01:47.080 --> 02:01:51.840]  special forces whether it's seals or not they're other equally important it's not
[02:01:51.840 --> 02:01:56.360]  more important units which I won't identify which are basically creating a
[02:01:56.360 --> 02:02:00.000]  story in and I only use the word obfuscate in other words they create
[02:02:00.000 --> 02:02:04.600]  certain details and narratives that one and not only confuse the American
[02:02:04.600 --> 02:02:09.720]  public for many reasons because they want to justify a narrative for these
[02:02:09.720 --> 02:02:13.040]  the president but more importantly from the intelligence community point of
[02:02:13.040 --> 02:02:17.040]  view they don't want other terrorist groups or other countries to really
[02:02:17.040 --> 02:02:21.960]  understand what it is that they're doing or how they did it in terms of coming
[02:02:21.960 --> 02:02:26.600]  in to a so-called area and acquiring information and creating this storyline
[02:02:26.600 --> 02:02:30.800]  which in fact a whole different storyline might have existed and that
[02:02:30.800 --> 02:02:37.000]  storyline we won't even know because the the intention of psyops and the lie
[02:02:37.000 --> 02:02:42.160]  and to create this narrative is to distract other elements outside of this
[02:02:42.160 --> 02:02:46.200]  country strategically either with it's another country whether it's Syria
[02:02:46.200 --> 02:02:52.200]  whether it's Iran to explain to them that if you think we're still ineffectual I
[02:02:52.200 --> 02:02:56.580]  think you better wake up I mean if I were to run a story like this and make
[02:02:56.580 --> 02:03:01.400]  it so confusing and all the only element that I would get out of it if our
[02:03:01.400 --> 02:03:05.760]  when this administration is to say to the Iranians listen we can create this
[02:03:05.760 --> 02:03:09.480]  narrative and maybe it doesn't work too well for the American public but the
[02:03:09.480 --> 02:03:14.520]  rest assured that what our helicopters not necessarily seals but our units are
[02:03:14.520 --> 02:03:20.640]  capable of entering into Iran and they have I won't I won't tell you which ones
[02:03:20.640 --> 02:03:24.200]  but they've they've gone into southern Iran and the Iranians are well aware
[02:03:24.200 --> 02:03:28.520]  that we're on the borders of Iraq in Afghanistan to put a lot of pressure on
[02:03:28.520 --> 02:03:33.800]  Iran and the Shiites to tell them to cease and desist getting and stirring up
[02:03:33.800 --> 02:03:38.920]  the pot in the Middle East particularly in Bahrain and Saudi Arabia our major
[02:03:38.920 --> 02:03:44.440]  concern right now is the Iranian influence that has that's in Syria
[02:03:44.440 --> 02:03:50.400]  that's in Hamas that's in Bahrain that's in Saudi Arabia so this kind of a
[02:03:50.400 --> 02:03:54.160]  story although it's not plausible to the United States and it's not even
[02:03:54.160 --> 02:03:58.440]  plausible to future terrorists the potential terrorist is really a way of
[02:03:58.440 --> 02:04:03.760]  denoting to Iran and to our potential enemy which is really Iran at this point
[02:04:03.760 --> 02:04:08.640]  who is sending out Islamic Revolutionary Guards all over the Middle East that
[02:04:08.640 --> 02:04:12.960]  cease and desist because we will confront you and the United States did
[02:04:12.960 --> 02:04:19.120]  undergave a very effective Secretary of Defense to help the Saudi Arabians to
[02:04:19.120 --> 02:04:25.320]  confront Iranian educators in Bahrain which is near Saudi Arabia and an
[02:04:25.320 --> 02:04:29.680]  eastern part of Saudi Arabia to say we're gonna put down this revolution but
[02:04:29.680 --> 02:04:34.720]  we're going to maintain stabilization of the Middle East and not secede it to the
[02:04:34.720 --> 02:04:39.560]  Shiites versus the Saudis because the major a strategic partner and all of this
[02:04:39.560 --> 02:04:44.080]  is not really Israel as much as it is Saudi Arabia who's very frightened that
[02:04:44.080 --> 02:04:49.280]  if the Shiites get into power they will be overthrown and the Shiites within
[02:04:49.280 --> 02:04:53.680]  that government all right Dr. Bachanik got a break let's come back and talk

[02:08:13.840 --> 02:08:20.280]  Pachinic is our guest formerly wrote the book in psychological warfare for the
[02:08:20.280 --> 02:08:27.920]  State Department as consulted and worked for five presidents heading up major
[02:08:27.920 --> 02:08:34.400]  departments at the Department of State under Kissinger and many others and he
[02:08:34.400 --> 02:08:37.000]  joins us for the rest of the hour I know we got loaded phones your calls are
[02:08:37.000 --> 02:08:42.920]  coming up I want to get into the out-of-control establishment that mr.
[02:08:42.920 --> 02:08:46.640]  Pachinic's been talking about in the danger of their hubris we're gonna be
[02:08:46.640 --> 02:08:49.560]  speaking with him in a moment also I want to finish up with his geopolitical
[02:08:49.560 --> 02:08:53.120]  outlook and what's really happening in Middle East but he said something very
[02:08:53.120 --> 02:08:58.120]  astute for stations that don't carry that first five minutes very astute I
[02:08:58.120 --> 02:09:04.120]  said I mean obviously astute but but he really cut to the heart of it I said why
[02:09:04.120 --> 02:09:08.840]  did they stage this at the core and obviously there's domestic reasons for
[02:09:08.840 --> 02:09:13.600]  reelection police state the defense complex once it's no bid contracts it's
[02:09:13.600 --> 02:09:17.800]  trillions I mean there's a cornucopia of reasons the globalist is the the
[02:09:17.800 --> 02:09:22.040]  engineers of society always go with something of it if it hits on all
[02:09:22.040 --> 02:09:27.320]  cylinders for me that helps them on a multifaceted multivariate level but I
[02:09:27.320 --> 02:09:32.120]  said what what's the core reason for this shoddy ridiculous bin Laden's been
[02:09:32.120 --> 02:09:38.560]  killed fable internationally and obviously it's to now menace Pakistan put
[02:09:38.560 --> 02:09:42.960]  pressure on them but that's only part of it he said it's Iran it's a message that
[02:09:42.960 --> 02:09:48.120]  look how ridiculous this is we don't care we will set you up we will attack you
[02:09:48.120 --> 02:09:53.400]  if you don't stop sending your people in trying to influence things in Bahrain
[02:09:53.400 --> 02:09:59.840]  things of course in Lebanon and other areas and he said it's a message to them
[02:09:59.840 --> 02:10:04.680]  it's meant for governments to be able to decipher it because it's so ham-fisted
[02:10:04.680 --> 02:10:07.640]  now I wanted to raise this and we actually had we are changed two years
[02:10:07.640 --> 02:10:16.000]  ago it's in now three years ago it's in my cinema verite documentary about 9-11
[02:10:16.000 --> 02:10:22.160]  truth truth rising of the 9-1-1 Chronicles Gary Hart got confronted
[02:10:22.160 --> 02:10:28.120]  about this but he wrote a letter September 26 2007 via the Huffington
[02:10:28.120 --> 02:10:33.160]  Post but also had it sent to the Iranian embassy overseas because they don't
[02:10:33.160 --> 02:10:39.760]  have one here unsolicited advice for the government of Iran and he said you can
[02:10:39.760 --> 02:10:42.800]  go read the letter he said presuming that you were not actually ignorant
[02:10:42.800 --> 02:10:46.360]  enough to desire war with the United States you might be well advised to read
[02:10:46.360 --> 02:10:50.880]  the history of the sinking of the USS Maine in Havana Arbor in 1898 and the
[02:10:50.880 --> 02:10:56.000]  history of the Gulf of Tonka in 1964 and it goes on to say we stage terror
[02:10:56.000 --> 02:11:01.960]  attacks and we'll stage him again do what you're told or we will nuke you now
[02:11:01.960 --> 02:11:06.120]  Hart thinks we're so dumb this was a letter for their intelligence people but
[02:11:06.120 --> 02:11:10.720]  when some a migrate activist friends that we are changed brought it up he said I
[02:11:10.720 --> 02:11:13.240]  never wrote that letter and they said here he is and he kind of freaked out he
[02:11:13.240 --> 02:11:19.040]  goes yeah I did write that and that is what I meant so again these globalists
[02:11:19.040 --> 02:11:23.520]  they communicate with each other like adults but for us they tell us been
[02:11:23.520 --> 02:11:28.120]  laden still alive Easter bunnies real lucky charms is real Kebler elves are
[02:11:28.120 --> 02:11:32.920]  real but this is exactly what dr. Pachennick was just saying here's heart
[02:11:32.920 --> 02:11:37.920]  this big you know top CFR globalist you know is skittering around with the whole
[02:11:37.920 --> 02:11:41.880]  9-11 operation because I saw him publicly bragging on hardball two months
[02:11:41.880 --> 02:11:46.400]  before 9-11 saying things are about to change haha and Matthews were having a
[02:11:46.400 --> 02:11:49.540]  little inside chuckle with each other because he psychopaths like to brag
[02:11:49.540 --> 02:11:54.880]  publicly but continuing dr. Pachennick that's exactly what you just said
[02:11:54.880 --> 02:12:00.080]  without me even raising this what's your take on what I just read to you well
[02:12:00.080 --> 02:12:05.320]  what you said is correct what's what's basically happening is that we are at
[02:12:05.320 --> 02:12:11.320]  war without you know the the president literally saying we are war in a very
[02:12:11.320 --> 02:12:16.600]  serious situation which unfortunately it I have to say this that Secretary of
[02:12:16.600 --> 02:12:20.960]  Defense Gates is probably the most serious member of this entire
[02:12:20.960 --> 02:12:25.400]  administration as he was of the Bush jr. actually there are many of us who
[02:12:25.400 --> 02:12:28.840]  work for Bush senior who really insisted on Gates coming in and getting rid of
[02:12:28.840 --> 02:12:33.360]  Rumsfeld for the simple reason that this man was directed at CIA he's a very
[02:12:33.360 --> 02:12:39.440]  non-ideological man extremely intelligent extremely oriented to
[02:12:39.440 --> 02:12:45.360]  understanding what America needs not what the political requirements are in
[02:12:45.360 --> 02:12:50.000]  terms of the politicians and we are now in a very serious confrontation with
[02:12:50.000 --> 02:12:55.560]  Iran because the Iranians have without a question created a lot of
[02:12:55.560 --> 02:13:02.000]  disturbances both in Syria and with the Syrians Bashir Assad who's also a
[02:13:02.000 --> 02:13:05.560]  physician by the way it's interesting we physicians are in the business of
[02:13:05.560 --> 02:13:09.080]  counterterrorism everywhere around the world so I warned the Obama
[02:13:09.080 --> 02:13:12.560]  administration if they don't give us reimbursements at the right place we all
[02:13:12.560 --> 02:13:18.080]  go into terrorism as a joke nevertheless we really have a problem
[02:13:18.080 --> 02:13:22.720]  because Bahrain is there and Saudi Arabia is there now the issue is it would
[02:13:22.720 --> 02:13:28.320]  have been nice as you said if the people on top would explain a thesis of what
[02:13:28.320 --> 02:13:32.400]  we are doing and where we are going we also have an economic war right now
[02:13:32.400 --> 02:13:36.680]  with China which is quite serious which gets to the issue what you said about
[02:13:36.680 --> 02:13:41.240]  we are purposely dropping the dollar I mean the Federal Reserve whatever else
[02:13:41.240 --> 02:13:46.720]  can be said about Bernanke is correctly dropping the dollar in order to go into
[02:13:46.720 --> 02:13:51.760]  economic warfare for ten years at the National War College I have requested
[02:13:51.760 --> 02:13:56.960]  economic warfare because it is the most effective mechanism that we in the United
[02:13:56.960 --> 02:14:02.040]  States have to undermine the Chinese economy which is totally totally
[02:14:02.040 --> 02:14:07.880]  controlled totally corrupt and allows us to bring back our manufacturing and our
[02:14:07.880 --> 02:14:12.760]  productivity and reinvent what we are best at which no other country in the
[02:14:12.760 --> 02:14:18.400]  world can do which is entrepreneurship and basically this lowering of the dollar
[02:14:18.400 --> 02:14:22.040]  is a way to say the Chinese you better watch us because we're going to
[02:14:22.040 --> 02:14:26.160]  undercut everything you have right now and as you've seen in China right now
[02:14:26.160 --> 02:14:30.400]  there have been riots in a normal year in China that's normal for them there are
[02:14:30.400 --> 02:14:36.080]  over 75,000 riots right now they have riots of cab drivers that are refusing
[02:14:36.080 --> 02:14:40.840]  to work a bus drivers are refusing to work they know that the American
[02:14:40.840 --> 02:14:45.240]  government is stimulating creating activities and the Chinese better listen
[02:14:45.240 --> 02:14:51.120]  carefully we are capable of taking down China if we want to when I was in China
[02:14:51.120 --> 02:14:54.800]  five years ago the first question they asked me because they knew I was an
[02:14:54.800 --> 02:14:59.800]  expert in regime change I don't need military to regime change I've done four
[02:14:59.800 --> 02:15:05.600]  five regime changes so the Union out tomorrow Panama I count Cambodia with
[02:15:05.600 --> 02:15:10.800]  formal lethal targets where they asked me and I was there on a business trip
[02:15:10.800 --> 02:15:13.800]  Alex as you know I'm really a businessman and they asked me the first
[02:15:13.800 --> 02:15:19.280]  question was are you here to take us down and obviously I looked at them and
[02:15:19.280 --> 02:15:22.760]  this is one of the heads of the intelligence community I said no but
[02:15:22.760 --> 02:15:28.160]  clearly I knew exactly the determinants of where they could be taken down and
[02:15:28.160 --> 02:15:33.120]  now in the presence of these kids with the Middle East disruption with the
[02:15:33.120 --> 02:15:38.280]  Facebook's with the Twitter they know that they're very vulnerable and one of
[02:15:38.280 --> 02:15:42.240]  the issues that we have right now and I think correctly is that we are talking
[02:15:42.240 --> 02:15:47.600]  with the Chinese to warn them number one you better raise the horn because we
[02:15:47.600 --> 02:15:52.680]  want to get rid of a lot of that debt that that is old that you we we owe to
[02:15:52.680 --> 02:15:55.880]  you that's we want to clear the deck of that that's the easiest way to do it
[02:15:55.880 --> 02:16:00.920]  secondly you better address the issues of middle-class rising and thirdly you
[02:16:00.920 --> 02:16:05.040]  better address the issues of human rights if we have Christian missionaries
[02:16:05.040 --> 02:16:10.600]  there don't disrupt them don't arrest people who want freedom so we have two
[02:16:10.600 --> 02:16:14.280]  fronts that are going on but nobody's explaining that to the American public
[02:16:14.280 --> 02:16:18.280]  on the one hand we have a war that's going on that's really targeted to Iran
[02:16:18.280 --> 02:16:23.640]  and really a war between the Shiites and the Sunni where we're trying to support
[02:16:23.640 --> 02:16:27.560]  the Sunni's well at the same time here's the irony of everything my friend
[02:16:27.560 --> 02:16:32.680]  without getting too much above it is that we have had to cut deals the
[02:16:32.680 --> 02:16:37.520]  military our US military is a very brave organization but they're also very smart
[02:16:37.520 --> 02:16:41.640]  they have to cut deals with the Iranians in order to control part of
[02:16:41.640 --> 02:16:46.920]  Afghanistan and to control Iraq in order to do that we had to tie down the
[02:16:46.920 --> 02:16:51.520]  right Iranian Revolutionary Guard while at the same time we have to show them
[02:16:51.520 --> 02:16:56.000]  that we can go in there at any time we want and create disturbances now what
[02:16:56.000 --> 02:17:01.480]  makes us even more interesting is that I'm inside who's the president of Iran
[02:17:01.480 --> 02:17:06.240]  everybody thinks he's crazy I don't he was a very effective he's a PhD in civil
[02:17:06.240 --> 02:17:11.360]  engineering was a very effective leader he is now in an internal battle with how
[02:17:11.360 --> 02:17:16.240]  many they're now claiming that his top advisors are devil worshipers that's
[02:17:16.240 --> 02:17:19.640]  correct well who did that I don't know whether that was devil worship but it's
[02:17:19.640 --> 02:17:23.280]  certainly not the most intelligent brightest effective guy let me just stop
[02:17:23.280 --> 02:17:25.800]  you let me just stop because that a doc now let me just stop because that sounds
[02:17:25.800 --> 02:17:33.000]  crazy a guy's put the Leningradian from Sunday the headline is Ahmed energies
[02:17:33.000 --> 02:17:38.760]  deputies charged with conjuring gins you can't make this up that's what the
[02:17:38.760 --> 02:17:43.320]  Islamic regime who decides if you can run for president that's what they're
[02:17:43.320 --> 02:17:48.320]  charging his people with his divination that's it you know let me just say
[02:17:48.320 --> 02:17:51.240]  but it sounds crazy so I could let folks know I didn't make that up just tell
[02:17:51.240 --> 02:17:56.720]  it there's an internal battle going on in Iran they hear us they're listening to
[02:17:56.720 --> 02:18:01.040]  us we're trying to affect that internal battle we the United States by
[02:18:01.040 --> 02:18:06.320]  positioning our forces and trying to attack and limit the number of agents
[02:18:06.320 --> 02:18:10.000]  is standing overseas that's all I'm saying I'm not getting into the belief
[02:18:10.000 --> 02:18:13.480]  systems the worship I understand what's going on in Libya what's going on in
[02:18:13.480 --> 02:18:18.400]  Libya Libya has been a mistake what happened in Libya is we had a lot of
[02:18:18.400 --> 02:18:23.520]  companies calling Halliburton John Deere a lot of the oil companies were in there
[02:18:23.520 --> 02:18:27.200]  but primarily we have no strategic interest in Libya Libya is really a
[02:18:27.200 --> 02:18:31.720]  strategic interest only to one country more than any and that is Italy Italy
[02:18:31.720 --> 02:18:37.120]  has about 40 to 50 percent of its oil through E&I coming in through Libya so
[02:18:37.120 --> 02:18:42.640]  the disturbances that were occurring in Libya was really a spillover from Egypt
[02:18:42.640 --> 02:18:47.920]  and ironically as you mentioned before one of the outcomes we brought back some
[02:18:47.920 --> 02:18:52.480]  of the al-Qaeda members from Afghanistan and Pakistan and one of them was
[02:18:52.480 --> 02:18:56.440]  entity you publicly saying actually the New York Times what do you feel about
[02:18:56.440 --> 02:19:00.480]  America now he said well before I was a hundred percent against America but now
[02:19:00.480 --> 02:19:05.080]  that America supplying us with special forces ammunition and the Egyptians are
[02:19:05.080 --> 02:19:10.840]  helping us I'm only 50% against America so you understand what's happening now
[02:19:10.840 --> 02:19:15.560]  is a world where everything is very great that's the point and what you're
[02:19:15.560 --> 02:19:19.960]  saying to the audience and what we do agree is why don't you explain this to
[02:19:19.960 --> 02:19:24.440]  the American public stop treating us as if we're dummies maybe we can't absorb
[02:19:24.440 --> 02:19:28.680]  all of it at one time we we don't want to hear it but stop treating us like
[02:19:28.680 --> 02:19:32.480]  dummies because number one we have to pay for all of this number two it's
[02:19:32.480 --> 02:19:36.880]  getting out of hand number three we have to leave from Iraq and Afghanistan and
[02:19:36.880 --> 02:19:41.240]  number four the only national security issue that's really relevant to any of
[02:19:41.240 --> 02:19:45.800]  us American is our national debt and the economy all right we're gonna take calls
[02:19:45.800 --> 02:19:49.360]  for a while but then we're gonna get into the debt banking before you leave us

[02:24:31.040 --> 02:24:37.240]  Dr. Steve Pachennick I want to go to Downey, John, Scott, Rich, Janice and many
[02:24:37.240 --> 02:24:40.800]  others that are patiently holding wanted to talk to you this is a short
[02:24:40.800 --> 02:24:44.560]  segment long segments coming up but you were making a point about what you
[02:24:44.560 --> 02:24:47.680]  think's gonna happen in the future you said things are gonna start spinning
[02:24:47.680 --> 02:24:51.200]  faster and faster we were talking behind the scenes now we came back live
[02:24:51.200 --> 02:24:55.680]  what point were you just now getting at well the economy is getting out of
[02:24:55.680 --> 02:25:00.480]  control our unemployment is too high we're starting to be taxed as you see
[02:25:00.480 --> 02:25:05.600]  today's nonprofit organizations need to pay taxes for water our services in the
[02:25:05.600 --> 02:25:10.160]  cities are really falling apart our infrastructure is falling apart we don't
[02:25:10.160 --> 02:25:14.960]  have an economic policy our inflation rate will go up as you correctly said
[02:25:14.960 --> 02:25:19.920]  we're in the wars that we don't belong we have to pull our soldiers back the
[02:25:19.920 --> 02:25:23.920]  Middle East will erupt even further China will confront us even more
[02:25:23.920 --> 02:25:28.000]  vigorously but the issues really have to come back to the American public
[02:25:28.000 --> 02:25:32.480]  we have to take back the monies in these wars that are not effective do not
[02:25:32.480 --> 02:25:35.680]  really touch our lives at this particular point in time and really
[02:25:35.680 --> 02:25:38.960]  restructure the United States so that we become
[02:25:38.960 --> 02:25:42.240]  America first we really have to concern ourselves
[02:25:42.240 --> 02:25:46.240]  with building our infrastructures building our national security in terms
[02:25:46.240 --> 02:25:51.360]  of the debt and cutting back on the eight hundred and fifty thousand
[02:25:51.360 --> 02:25:55.840]  individuals that top secret clearance on counter terrorism it's absurd
[02:25:55.840 --> 02:26:00.080]  it's absolutely ridiculous and the American public is paying for all this
[02:26:00.080 --> 02:26:03.600]  ridiculous nonsense on terrorism that doesn't exist
[02:26:03.600 --> 02:26:06.720]  our real terror issue is the financial crisis
[02:26:06.720 --> 02:26:11.520]  which you said in one of the ads and now we have to focus on America we need a
[02:26:11.520 --> 02:26:16.400]  leader who understands how to be a non-ideological
[02:26:16.400 --> 02:26:23.760]  hands-on forceful individual who's had a history of business experience and
[02:26:23.760 --> 02:26:26.960]  knows how to lead us forward in terms of the economy
[02:26:26.960 --> 02:26:30.800]  all right doc doc let's do this i'm sorry i don't mean you but it's what was
[02:26:30.800 --> 02:26:33.680]  said to bush senior it's the economy it feels
[02:26:33.680 --> 02:26:37.120]  stance on that doc let me stop you since this is a short segment i promise we'll
[02:26:37.120 --> 02:26:40.480]  directly the calls in the next let's get into the economy now what do we do
[02:26:40.480 --> 02:26:45.040]  about the private central banks who make the giant bonuses
[02:26:45.040 --> 02:26:47.920]  you'll take the tax money i mean they're not going to stop doing what they're
[02:26:47.920 --> 02:26:51.680]  doing i mean so where do you see america going what are the main
[02:26:51.680 --> 02:26:55.600]  crises facing us well number one the banking system has to be
[02:26:55.600 --> 02:26:59.440]  rechanged it's absurd that none of the bankers were indicted particularly
[02:26:59.440 --> 02:27:02.880]  blank fine ron rubin who worked for city bank
[02:27:02.880 --> 02:27:07.280]  received 75 million dollars was very much in charge as a consultant
[02:27:07.280 --> 02:27:10.800]  for all the corruption that occurred in the subprime mortgages
[02:27:10.800 --> 02:27:14.560]  and he was asked well what did you do you receive 75 million in bonus you said
[02:27:14.560 --> 02:27:17.680]  well i didn't know anything about it this is our former secretary of the
[02:27:17.680 --> 02:27:20.400]  treasury you're talking about warren buffett
[02:27:20.400 --> 02:27:23.920]  who owned uh 40 percent of moody's he took
[02:27:23.920 --> 02:27:30.720]  double b rated uh junk uh subprimes and then reconverted it to triple a and
[02:27:30.720 --> 02:27:34.640]  sold it and warren buffett goes as the sanctimonious priest of
[02:27:34.640 --> 02:27:38.960]  entrepreneurship and americans says no i had nothing to do with it these are
[02:27:38.960 --> 02:27:42.800]  men who should be investigated they shouldn't be indicted and put in
[02:27:42.800 --> 02:27:45.360]  prison we are not going after the right
[02:27:45.360 --> 02:27:49.280]  individuals the head of dolman sacks the head of jp morgan
[02:27:49.280 --> 02:27:53.680]  should be in prison not just reprimanded but the reason why they're not is
[02:27:53.680 --> 02:27:57.920]  because it's a pollution this is not conspiracy this was even written by the
[02:27:57.920 --> 02:28:01.520]  american governor in the financial crisis report i recommend that everybody
[02:28:01.520 --> 02:28:05.280]  read it there's an individual who might don't know phil angeles who did a
[02:28:05.280 --> 02:28:09.600]  brilliant brilliant analysis and commission report how corrupt our
[02:28:09.600 --> 02:28:14.400]  banking system is and it hasn't changed we have 21st century
[02:28:14.400 --> 02:28:18.640]  second-tier banking which is not controlled with all kinds of derivatives
[02:28:18.640 --> 02:28:21.920]  and all kinds of financial instruments that will i can
[02:28:21.920 --> 02:28:26.160]  precipitate another financial crisis with 19th century regulation
[02:28:26.160 --> 02:28:30.000]  and we have individuals who were turning around in a uh
[02:28:30.000 --> 02:28:34.080]  turnstile who report who work in our government and they go back out into the
[02:28:34.080 --> 02:28:37.120]  private sector and they have no loyalty to our
[02:28:37.120 --> 02:28:40.800]  country so our real problems now is really to
[02:28:40.800 --> 02:28:44.160]  indict and to get to investigate wall street without this
[02:28:44.160 --> 02:28:48.480]  nonsense of saying you know you you i know you did bad but
[02:28:48.480 --> 02:28:52.000]  you know don't do it again and the answer is no they go to prison
[02:28:52.000 --> 02:28:55.600]  y'all just take one guy who's on an indian or shulankan
[02:28:55.600 --> 02:28:59.280]  and put him in because there's an inside of trading you put all of these heads in
[02:28:59.280 --> 02:29:03.120]  prison and this is basically what comes out of the financial crisis inquiry
[02:29:03.120 --> 02:29:06.640]  report and you put a man like greenspan who knew what was
[02:29:06.640 --> 02:29:10.320]  happening and hold him accountable instead of allowing him to go on the
[02:29:10.320 --> 02:29:14.000]  press and and continue this nonsensical story
[02:29:14.000 --> 02:29:18.640]  where yes i allowed the free trading company the free trade to go on and i
[02:29:18.640 --> 02:29:23.760]  allowed derivatives to go on and dcds and cds but i'm not accountable that
[02:29:23.760 --> 02:29:28.000]  really was a blip in our economy or the falses who were brought in and knew
[02:29:28.000 --> 02:29:31.440]  nothing about our financial capabilities an investment banker
[02:29:31.440 --> 02:29:36.240]  again and again the names are out there the reports are out there but we don't
[02:29:36.240 --> 02:29:40.880]  have courageous politicians while dr steve pacenic got a break call
[02:29:40.880 --> 02:29:44.240]  straight ahead and before he leaves we'll get more into where we're going
[02:29:44.240 --> 02:29:48.400]  financially if this isn't reversed very bold

[02:31:11.760 --> 02:31:15.200]  to control how much power your electric company allows you to have
[02:31:15.200 --> 02:31:19.440]  it's true total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid
[02:31:19.440 --> 02:31:23.040]  technology is coming number three in some areas of the country
[02:31:23.040 --> 02:31:27.520]  the power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation
[02:31:27.520 --> 02:31:31.360]  is only compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a
[02:31:31.360 --> 02:31:34.560]  threat to local grids every year thousands of families lose
[02:31:34.560 --> 02:31:38.480]  their power from weather related onages number five a solar power generator

[02:33:11.520 --> 02:33:15.440]  downy in texas you're on the air with dr. steve pacenic go ahead
[02:33:15.440 --> 02:33:19.040]  thank you alex i'd like to ask the doctor what is more embarrassing
[02:33:19.040 --> 02:33:25.440]  or dangerous or intelligence agencies and f inconsistent unbelievable narrative
[02:33:25.440 --> 02:33:28.880]  and the main media trying to fight it and defend it
[02:33:28.880 --> 02:33:33.120]  or the fact that there are a great number of well-meaning americans
[02:33:33.120 --> 02:33:37.600]  that believe the fairy tale which one's more embarrassing
[02:33:37.600 --> 02:33:43.440]  well you know you hit it on the head i i think it's embarrassing that the uh
[02:33:43.440 --> 02:33:47.440]  the intelligence narrative that's so bizarre that the mainstream media it's
[02:33:47.440 --> 02:33:51.680]  an indictment of the mainstream media and and everybody
[02:33:51.680 --> 02:33:55.360]  uh involved in it and it tells you that the new york times and the
[02:33:55.360 --> 02:33:58.880]  washington post and all these so-called distinguished
[02:33:58.880 --> 02:34:04.320]  that newspapers are really you know it's pathetic so i would agree that i think
[02:34:04.320 --> 02:34:08.080]  it's very embarrassing uh the first one but that's an excellent question
[02:34:08.080 --> 02:34:11.760]  and and unfortunately you bring up the point that they treat us as if we're
[02:34:11.760 --> 02:34:15.520]  dumb running and we're not well i want downy
[02:34:15.520 --> 02:34:18.240]  i want downy to be able to ask another question
[02:34:18.240 --> 02:34:21.920]  and then have dr pacenic elaborate but i want to say this
[02:34:21.920 --> 02:34:26.720]  i think that's the method to the madness is they're trying to get all of us to
[02:34:26.720 --> 02:34:30.720]  buy into it torture being good tsa sticking their hands down our
[02:34:30.720 --> 02:34:34.240]  pants two million dollar defense department cameras
[02:34:34.240 --> 02:34:38.720]  in one elementary school studying the kids in san antonio
[02:34:38.720 --> 02:34:44.560]  all of this is over the top on purpose to give us learned helplessness and
[02:34:44.560 --> 02:34:47.040]  you're a psychiatrist you know about that doctor
[02:34:47.040 --> 02:34:50.640]  and but but more importantly they're testing the mainstream media
[02:34:50.640 --> 02:34:53.840]  and getting them to buy into things that are cartoonish
[02:34:53.840 --> 02:34:58.240]  to just train them to accept more and more crazy things it's like in the last
[02:34:58.240 --> 02:35:01.280]  nine years i see ap articles every month
[02:35:01.280 --> 02:35:05.120]  ben laden puts out new warning he will strike
[02:35:05.120 --> 02:35:08.640]  and then at the bottom it'll say this came from a message board
[02:35:08.640 --> 02:35:12.240]  with no proof so they're they're training us to run with
[02:35:12.240 --> 02:35:16.000]  idiocy i mean doctor i mean isn't there some of that going on here or is it
[02:35:16.000 --> 02:35:19.360]  just well let me see the most important part in my
[02:35:19.360 --> 02:35:22.720]  point of view i don't have to be a psychiatrist just from a financial point
[02:35:22.720 --> 02:35:26.080]  of view i think what you're seeing is the death
[02:35:26.080 --> 02:35:29.040]  the death knell of the mainstream media in other words
[02:35:29.040 --> 02:35:32.720]  as much as the president has been desperate and came out with this
[02:35:32.720 --> 02:35:36.240]  nonsensical story what you're seeing is the mainstream
[02:35:36.240 --> 02:35:41.040]  media is converting from the so-called journalism that was really practiced
[02:35:41.040 --> 02:35:43.840]  very well at columbia school and elsewhere
[02:35:43.840 --> 02:35:47.280]  into a cartoon they become graphic novels and the reason
[02:35:47.280 --> 02:35:51.200]  isn't so much they're trying to suppress us the reason is
[02:35:51.200 --> 02:35:55.840]  is they are losing money and they are in financial trouble you know you follow
[02:35:55.840 --> 02:35:59.040]  the money trail in america and you find out what's the problem
[02:35:59.040 --> 02:36:02.640]  and instead of going back to what made them great they're digging their hole
[02:36:02.640 --> 02:36:05.040]  deeper they're digging their hole deep
[02:36:05.040 --> 02:36:08.640]  the hole is very deep i mean the main holder
[02:36:08.640 --> 02:36:13.120]  who's giving them a bond that they have to pay 14 percent interest on
[02:36:13.120 --> 02:36:17.680]  is a mexican who owns the new york times now the new york times doesn't do an
[02:36:17.680 --> 02:36:21.360]  internal story on them the washington post is in trouble
[02:36:21.360 --> 02:36:26.400]  because the internet is competing with them the financial times is basically
[02:36:26.400 --> 02:36:30.400]  an extension of pierson international which has never done very well
[02:36:30.400 --> 02:36:33.760]  they were the overseers of my publishing company berkeley
[02:36:33.760 --> 02:36:37.520]  they've never done well they now have a new president who's an accountant
[02:36:37.520 --> 02:36:41.120]  and basically really doesn't know anything they never made a profit
[02:36:41.120 --> 02:36:45.280]  so when you look at these elements and these financial institutions that try
[02:36:45.280 --> 02:36:48.400]  to suppress us it's not working anymore
[02:36:48.400 --> 02:36:52.160]  that's the comedy of the entire thing it's a tragic comedy because they have
[02:36:52.160 --> 02:36:55.520]  become not newspapers but graphic novels if you
[02:36:55.520 --> 02:36:57.680]  look at the front page of the new york times
[02:36:57.680 --> 02:37:01.600]  what's the mainline story girls who go to the prom
[02:37:01.600 --> 02:37:05.920]  second night that's the major story that you want to know about girls going to a
[02:37:05.920 --> 02:37:10.080]  prom when in fact the entire world is falling apart and there's more news on
[02:37:10.080 --> 02:37:13.360]  alex jones well how is it the new york times
[02:37:13.360 --> 02:37:18.400]  or nsnbc which is also going under because cable news networks are going
[02:37:18.400 --> 02:37:23.360]  under the tv shows are going under they know that because i do tv shows abc has
[02:37:23.360 --> 02:37:27.200]  not been effective nbc has not been effective all of
[02:37:27.200 --> 02:37:30.160]  these narcissistic fools that you see on there
[02:37:30.160 --> 02:37:33.200]  loading their own presence as commentators
[02:37:33.200 --> 02:37:36.560]  has to compete with alex jones who's not seen
[02:37:36.560 --> 02:37:39.920]  and basically is heard and he has to say the truth so
[02:37:39.920 --> 02:37:43.760]  how are they going to compete with you alex they have financial troubles
[02:37:43.760 --> 02:37:47.120]  you may not i'm not interested but the point is you have a growing audience in
[02:37:47.120 --> 02:37:50.960]  the america public is not reading this nonsense anymore well that's the thing
[02:37:50.960 --> 02:37:54.800]  doc i mean if they tried to do any real news
[02:37:54.800 --> 02:37:58.240]  with all of their money and power we wouldn't be competition forum
[02:37:58.240 --> 02:38:02.800]  i mean it's scary that a couple years ago i had three million listeners a week
[02:38:02.800 --> 02:38:07.680]  and now we've done the numbers again lately it's more like five million a day
[02:38:07.680 --> 02:38:13.440]  radio two million a day internet uh just on one youtube channel five million
[02:38:13.440 --> 02:38:18.400]  views do you have to advertise on cnb no
[02:38:18.400 --> 02:38:22.480]  cnn to tell them why is the new york times
[02:38:22.480 --> 02:38:26.080]  advertising even telling you why they are so important when they only have a
[02:38:26.080 --> 02:38:29.600]  readership of maybe six hundred thousand no that's what i'm saying is they're
[02:38:29.600 --> 02:38:33.840]  paper tigers at my point i mean one minute on msnbc
[02:38:33.840 --> 02:38:38.720]  during prime time with half a million viewers cost 10 15 20 000 dollars
[02:38:38.720 --> 02:38:42.160]  uh a ad here with a bigger audience literally dwarfing it
[02:38:42.160 --> 02:38:45.920]  is 300 bucks so that's the last illusion to fall
[02:38:45.920 --> 02:38:50.720]  is that is that is that you you pay 15 20 times
[02:38:50.720 --> 02:38:54.480]  uh for something that is worth far less
[02:38:54.480 --> 02:38:57.600]  and they know that that final shoe is dropping but
[02:38:57.600 --> 02:39:01.600]  uh we could talk forever with dr pacenic uh no but the point here is not
[02:39:01.600 --> 02:39:06.400]  there at the point is what the what the gentleman said it is embarrassing
[02:39:06.400 --> 02:39:11.280]  not for us it's embarrassing for them because this is the death note
[02:39:11.280 --> 02:39:15.360]  for them in buying the intelligence of false narratives
[02:39:15.360 --> 02:39:19.760]  and then reinventing the narratives and trying to dissect the narratives
[02:39:19.760 --> 02:39:25.360]  with comedy and absurdity so you know honestly it's really an indictment of
[02:39:25.360 --> 02:39:29.040]  the system and the gentleman is absolutely correct down anything else
[02:39:29.040 --> 02:39:32.000]  down anything else yeah my son's not gonna believe i got on
[02:39:32.000 --> 02:39:36.160]  his 10 year old and uh big fan of yours so i'll just say
[02:39:36.160 --> 02:39:40.480]  a boy that's his name nick name and uh i do have a question for you do you have
[02:39:40.480 --> 02:39:44.000]  any plans for this coming 9 11 looks pretty big
[02:39:44.000 --> 02:39:48.720]  you know you know i don't know it look look look here's the deal
[02:39:48.720 --> 02:39:52.160]  i get invited all over the place and people want to pay me oh
[02:39:52.160 --> 02:39:55.280]  i'm not no exaggeration i've been offered a lot of money to go speak at
[02:39:55.280 --> 02:39:58.320]  events i could do that i could pack
[02:39:58.320 --> 02:40:02.160]  three four times what glenn beck does but then to pay for it you got to sell
[02:40:02.160 --> 02:40:05.120]  tickets and stuff i just i just more and more i can
[02:40:05.120 --> 02:40:09.840]  electronically study read sit here in my little crow's nest
[02:40:09.840 --> 02:40:13.040]  and and tell folks what's over the horizon and then
[02:40:13.040 --> 02:40:17.120]  we go over the horizon and there's you know there it is i can reach
[02:40:17.120 --> 02:40:20.560]  no exaggeration it's exponential i'm not bragging in fact it's very daunting
[02:40:20.560 --> 02:40:25.200]  it's it it it it it it it's humbling because i realize i'm just a regular guy
[02:40:25.200 --> 02:40:29.360]  we're reaching again it was three million a day
[02:40:29.360 --> 02:40:33.360]  overall just a few months ago now it's over five million and the growth curve
[02:40:33.360 --> 02:40:36.160]  is within six months we'll be reaching 10 million a day
[02:40:36.160 --> 02:40:40.800]  and so i could go to demonstrations in new york i could go down in bullhorn
[02:40:40.800 --> 02:40:44.560]  obama it's just those are p shooters compared to
[02:40:44.560 --> 02:40:49.360]  what this electronic system can do now getting the the public to move
[02:40:49.360 --> 02:40:53.680]  onto the streets and and to the state houses that's where the power is and
[02:40:53.680 --> 02:40:56.720]  that's when i have dr pacinic back on soon to talk about
[02:40:56.720 --> 02:41:00.160]  ways the ideas he's got to really get the american people moving but i appreciate
[02:41:00.160 --> 02:41:03.840]  your call downy and i'm not bragging about the power of this show it actually
[02:41:03.840 --> 02:41:06.560]  freaks me out because i just feel like a regular
[02:41:06.560 --> 02:41:11.200]  common sense guy who studied things this stuff's all very clear what's going on
[02:41:11.200 --> 02:41:16.240]  and uh the establishment i think is drinking their own koolaid
[02:41:16.240 --> 02:41:19.760]  they basically poison the well of information but then they drank from it
[02:41:19.760 --> 02:41:23.680]  john in texas you're on the air with dr steve pacinic of steve pacinic dot com
[02:41:23.680 --> 02:41:27.200]  go ahead john doctor and alex this is an honor
[02:41:27.200 --> 02:41:30.720]  i'm going to simplify what you all have been talking about and i think and i
[02:41:30.720 --> 02:41:33.520]  want the doctor's response on what i have to say
[02:41:33.520 --> 02:41:37.840]  but i believe that since world war two there the globalists
[02:41:37.840 --> 02:41:44.480]  and the corporates have had an agenda to manipulate the world's assets and
[02:41:44.480 --> 02:41:48.880]  reserves things of minerals and natural resources and things that are of value
[02:41:48.880 --> 02:41:53.520]  to large multinational corporations and i'm a firm believer
[02:41:53.520 --> 02:41:56.880]  that the resources of the american people
[02:41:56.880 --> 02:42:02.240]  have been mortgaged through the military industrial complex and the cia
[02:42:02.240 --> 02:42:05.360]  and all of these secret armies and illegal activities
[02:42:05.360 --> 02:42:09.840]  and by the way i think osama is is more or less a theatrical prop
[02:42:09.840 --> 02:42:16.000]  to benefit the the globalist agenda to confiscate
[02:42:16.000 --> 02:42:21.680]  and and and materialize huge masses of wealth for their own benefit
[02:42:21.680 --> 02:42:26.800]  and i think patriotism has been confused with this globalist agenda
[02:42:26.800 --> 02:42:30.720]  and i think it's so simple we have been duped as americans
[02:42:30.720 --> 02:42:34.080]  into believing that we've been fighting wars on terrorism
[02:42:34.080 --> 02:42:37.840]  when it all boils down very simply to taking
[02:42:37.840 --> 02:42:41.680]  the assets of sovereign nations with real people just like you and i in those
[02:42:41.680 --> 02:42:46.720]  countries who did who live there and by the way would sell them to us cheaper
[02:42:46.720 --> 02:42:50.000]  they would sell it to us but then the military industrial complex
[02:42:50.000 --> 02:42:53.360]  and the banks and others couldn't control those countries
[02:42:53.360 --> 02:42:57.520]  and couldn't make money in the stealing of it from us the taxpayers but
[02:42:57.520 --> 02:43:00.000]  what's your question for dr pacenic because what you're saying is just
[02:43:00.000 --> 02:43:03.920]  historical reality well let me say with uh secretary
[02:43:03.920 --> 02:43:08.880]  defense gates that said basically supporting the military industrial
[02:43:08.880 --> 02:43:12.480]  complex for more money and more acquisitions of the
[02:43:12.480 --> 02:43:18.320]  third uh studies and and and equipment that we don't
[02:43:18.320 --> 02:43:23.360]  need along the lines you said is not indicative of more patriotism if
[02:43:23.360 --> 02:43:28.800]  anything less is more uh we have to go back to the concerns of
[02:43:28.800 --> 02:43:33.200]  our own country as you implied which means we have to develop our own
[02:43:33.200 --> 02:43:36.800]  oil resources uh in the united states we have it
[02:43:36.800 --> 02:43:41.920]  in montana we have enough oil to the equal what you have in saudi arabia
[02:43:41.920 --> 02:43:45.680]  we have to deal with our own water supplies where we don't have to ship it
[02:43:45.680 --> 02:43:48.960]  overseas we have to be able to build our own
[02:43:48.960 --> 02:43:53.280]  infrastructure is short the the crux of our a system the
[02:43:53.280 --> 02:43:58.560]  klepto uh uh the topocracy that came out of the system
[02:43:58.560 --> 02:44:04.160]  is not american and should be destroyed uh simply as that the wall street the
[02:44:04.160 --> 02:44:08.000]  transnational corporations there's no reason why the oil companies
[02:44:08.000 --> 02:44:11.040]  shouldn't be taxed and shouldn't be held accountable
[02:44:11.040 --> 02:44:15.840]  uh they're not supplying the oil to the united states what their propaganda is
[02:44:15.840 --> 02:44:20.320]  very simply is the oil that we acquired in the middle east doesn't go to
[02:44:20.320 --> 02:44:24.560]  america it goes to china and japan so you're correct
[02:44:24.560 --> 02:44:28.160]  we're sending soldiers to protect uh of pipelines
[02:44:28.160 --> 02:44:31.440]  which don't really have any national security bearing
[02:44:31.440 --> 02:44:35.680]  but people like cheney that what i call the cowards and the alcoholics like
[02:44:35.680 --> 02:44:38.480]  cheney who was a bum to begin with and then
[02:44:38.480 --> 02:44:42.240]  jail where he was thrown out and then wisconsin who never fought a war
[02:44:42.240 --> 02:44:46.480]  and and and refused to serve our country is typical
[02:44:46.480 --> 02:44:50.640]  of these transnational corporations the military industrial complex
[02:44:50.640 --> 02:44:55.920]  where the cowardly cheney was the most cowardly vice president i had ever met
[02:44:55.920 --> 02:45:00.560]  who refused to serve eight times and then in braggadocio this alcoholic
[02:45:00.560 --> 02:45:05.520]  bum from texas goes out and now lives in wyoming i know exactly where he lives
[02:45:05.520 --> 02:45:10.080]  and then insists that we go to war on behalf of his transnational oil
[02:45:10.080 --> 02:45:13.280]  companies from texas and elsewhere and then the bum
[02:45:13.280 --> 02:45:17.600]  moves haliburton to dubai and that's haliburton to dubai and by
[02:45:17.600 --> 02:45:22.480]  way haliburton was as you know the subsidiary was lbj's company bbnr
[02:45:22.480 --> 02:45:25.680]  which was then taken over and what's interesting is cheney
[02:45:25.680 --> 02:45:29.760]  actually lost while he was ceo net asset values of halibur
[02:45:29.760 --> 02:45:32.800]  but by point is very simple to the american public
[02:45:32.800 --> 02:45:36.720]  this is enough if we do not hold these leaders of the transnational
[02:45:36.720 --> 02:45:39.840]  corporations of the banking world and the president
[02:45:39.840 --> 02:45:44.160]  who does represent the interests of the banking world mr donlan who represents
[02:45:44.160 --> 02:45:48.480]  fanny may and the crookedness of it or the ben roads who's nothing more than a
[02:45:48.480 --> 02:45:51.440]  local politician from new york or the clinton's
[02:45:51.440 --> 02:45:55.040]  who have been you know he was really amazing when clinton left office he said
[02:45:55.040 --> 02:45:58.080]  oh i'm so poor within years he became a hundred
[02:45:58.080 --> 02:46:02.560]  millionaire and basically his wife who uh was against the
[02:46:02.560 --> 02:46:06.880]  ports of dubai that dubai bought our ports while clinton was supporting it
[02:46:06.880 --> 02:46:10.080]  oh it's all stage we gotta move fast we gotta move fast
[02:46:10.080 --> 02:46:14.080]  dog part of the art of our republic and we have to destroy this kind of
[02:46:14.080 --> 02:46:17.840]  leptocracy period leptocracy is a good word for it crony
[02:46:17.840 --> 02:46:21.440]  leptocracy leptocracy and that's what i think the gentleman's
[02:46:21.440 --> 02:46:24.640]  getting at whatever you want to call it it's a leptocracy i gotta get to these
[02:46:24.640 --> 02:46:28.400]  colors are very good points thank you john scott in texas then rich in
[02:46:28.400 --> 02:46:32.400]  arizona janison minnesota uh and then david long
[02:46:32.400 --> 02:46:35.280]  island's all we got time for scott in texas go ahead
[02:46:35.280 --> 02:46:38.480]  yeah there's a uh thanks for taking my call god bless you guys listen to things
[02:46:38.480 --> 02:46:43.440]  real quick in that staged situation room photo i was noticing how obama just
[02:46:43.440 --> 02:46:46.800]  sitting there looking like a whipped dog if there was a picture taken a few
[02:46:46.800 --> 02:46:49.360]  seconds early it probably shows him serving coffee i mean
[02:46:49.360 --> 02:46:52.400]  presidential is the last thing he looks like in that picture i don't know why
[02:46:52.400 --> 02:46:56.960]  they put that one out well rama manual uh his uh little friend his little
[02:46:56.960 --> 02:47:00.960]  ballet dancer helper uh in public the new york town's reported
[02:47:00.960 --> 02:47:04.720]  cracks his knuckles does fist things in front of the congressional delegations
[02:47:04.720 --> 02:47:10.000]  and bosses obama around in front of him uh like he literally is his valet
[02:47:10.000 --> 02:47:15.440]  dr pacenic comments well i think it's a bizarre relationship to begin with
[02:47:15.440 --> 02:47:21.120]  that's why i said and i do fair warning to obama that i think the longer he goes
[02:47:21.120 --> 02:47:24.240]  out and propagates this nonsense and narrative
[02:47:24.240 --> 02:47:28.640]  well with donlan there and with that daily from the chicago machinery it's
[02:47:28.640 --> 02:47:31.440]  going to open up questions about his relationship
[02:47:31.440 --> 02:47:35.200]  with rami emanuel who got a master's degree in ballet
[02:47:35.200 --> 02:47:39.280]  and he himself has a questionable history how he came to that position
[02:47:39.280 --> 02:47:44.080]  but what's a disconnect and here's the important part uh alex and and my dear
[02:47:44.080 --> 02:47:49.520]  friends on the show if you were to have an individual a woman and now follow me
[02:47:49.520 --> 02:47:53.840]  for a minute who in nineteen sixties on her own
[02:47:53.840 --> 02:47:59.440]  had a phd and went out to a this is a christian woman who goes into a muslim
[02:47:59.440 --> 02:48:03.920]  country like indonesia and serves our country
[02:48:03.920 --> 02:48:08.320]  bravely uh teaching but doing other things that are for our national
[02:48:08.320 --> 02:48:12.800]  security in an attempted coup i think i would be pretty proud of them my mother
[02:48:12.800 --> 02:48:15.920]  if that were her well that turns out to be obama's mother
[02:48:15.920 --> 02:48:19.680]  now there is a major disconnect between this man
[02:48:19.680 --> 02:48:23.840]  who looks like he's really zombied out most of the time i don't think he has no
[02:48:23.840 --> 02:48:27.440]  major affect he is bossed around i i often find
[02:48:27.440 --> 02:48:30.400]  that he's bossed around by his wife i mean i find it bizarre
[02:48:30.400 --> 02:48:34.640]  that michelle leaves on the on the president's birthday with his girlfriend
[02:48:34.640 --> 02:48:38.480]  in spain all of this is bizarre but my most bizarre
[02:48:38.480 --> 02:48:42.800]  is this disconnect between a woman who is exceedingly brave
[02:48:42.800 --> 02:48:48.160]  from midwest america goes into a country that was exceedingly dangerous for the
[02:48:48.160 --> 02:48:51.440]  years of the life the lives of living years the years of living
[02:48:51.440 --> 02:48:56.160]  dangerously into indonesia and then turns out to be the mother
[02:48:56.160 --> 02:48:59.440]  of obama well there's no doubt i mean as you know
[02:48:59.440 --> 02:49:02.880]  oh you just said ci operative so you have that same entail
[02:49:02.880 --> 02:49:07.120]  yeah i mean it matches correct it's not just that but i checked it up on beyond
[02:49:07.120 --> 02:49:10.880]  that when you work for the east west center which i was uh you know i was
[02:49:10.880 --> 02:49:14.080]  involved with because i was deputy assistant secretary of east asia
[02:49:14.080 --> 02:49:18.960]  that's in hawaii and i you work for the cia one way or the other you fund it
[02:49:18.960 --> 02:49:24.880]  yeah at bhc a woman who teaches russian and learns russian in 1950s and 60s
[02:49:24.880 --> 02:49:28.320]  should be very proud she worked for the ci now let me explain this to the
[02:49:28.320 --> 02:49:31.360]  audience working for the ci is not anathema
[02:49:31.360 --> 02:49:35.040]  they have protected our country during the 50s and 60s
[02:49:35.040 --> 02:49:38.720]  and 70s what's anathema is that the degradation
[02:49:38.720 --> 02:49:43.280]  that has happened to the cia and the rest of the intelligence community
[02:49:43.280 --> 02:49:46.320]  because they were taken over by people who
[02:49:46.320 --> 02:49:50.640]  insisted that this intelligence network which has been very valuable to our
[02:49:50.640 --> 02:49:55.600]  national security now serve domestic purposes and purposes that don't fit
[02:49:55.600 --> 02:49:59.040]  on the national security system but if i had a mother
[02:49:59.040 --> 02:50:03.760]  who had been in the cia and served my country and put her life at stake in a
[02:50:03.760 --> 02:50:08.000]  muslim country in 1960 my god i would stand up and
[02:50:08.000 --> 02:50:11.280]  said i am very proud there's a total disconnect here
[02:50:11.280 --> 02:50:14.640]  this president doesn't say anything about a mother bestie says is
[02:50:14.640 --> 02:50:19.040]  she's a hippie that was no hippie a woman who's studying russian and goes
[02:50:19.040 --> 02:50:22.800]  into indonesia works for the export import bank
[02:50:22.800 --> 02:50:27.360]  the hawaii east east west center those are facts that's not something that's
[02:50:27.360 --> 02:50:30.160]  made up that's and by the way i do not know him
[02:50:30.160 --> 02:50:33.440]  but i know his clearances were a lot higher than my clearances if you're
[02:50:33.440 --> 02:50:36.320]  working at the national security agency for sure
[02:50:36.320 --> 02:50:41.520]  my point is if you put it all together we have a very dangerous situation where
[02:50:41.520 --> 02:50:45.280]  a president whose background has been questionable at best
[02:50:45.280 --> 02:50:50.160]  whose performance is questionable at best whose next speech next week will be
[02:50:50.160 --> 02:50:55.360]  about how he killed osama bin laden how that fits into the riots in the middle
[02:50:55.360 --> 02:50:58.640]  east which i have no idea become even more bizarre
[02:50:58.640 --> 02:51:02.000]  who's fronting for the best of it as i can understand
[02:51:02.000 --> 02:51:06.160]  for politicians and businessmen who are from wall street who've never been in
[02:51:06.160 --> 02:51:10.080]  tithes for cleftocracy we have a republican and a democratic
[02:51:10.080 --> 02:51:13.600]  political body that is totally cowardly
[02:51:13.600 --> 02:51:17.680]  whose only interest is self-aggrandizement and we have an american public
[02:51:17.680 --> 02:51:22.560]  that's waiting to erupt to say cease and desist all this nonsense our major
[02:51:22.560 --> 02:51:27.840]  concerns has to be the debt jobs we don't have enough jobs
[02:51:27.840 --> 02:51:32.080]  community services we don't want to go absolutely doc we're almost out of time
[02:51:32.080 --> 02:51:35.040]  let's go to some more calls scott real fast anything else
[02:51:35.040 --> 02:51:38.160]  yeah i thought i think it's insulting that they tell us that obama was or osama
[02:51:38.160 --> 02:51:41.200]  was still uh masterminding and orchestrating all of this stuff and
[02:51:41.200 --> 02:51:45.520]  then they show us this picture and his hq's got two old tv's a vcr in a laptop
[02:51:45.520 --> 02:51:48.880]  i mean that makes financial security look ridiculous it's all fake in that
[02:51:48.880 --> 02:51:53.440]  minute it is you're absolutely correct i mean it's all fake folks you're right
[02:51:53.440 --> 02:51:56.560]  i mean i mean literally him and a manual are dancing around in women's clothing
[02:51:56.560 --> 02:52:02.320]  i mean it's just ridiculous uh rich in arizona you're on the air go ahead
[02:52:02.320 --> 02:52:06.720]  go ahead rich and i'm gonna have to turn my speaker off so i had a uh question
[02:52:06.720 --> 02:52:11.040]  for dr patik and also if you'll allow me to i want to just a quick comment of
[02:52:11.040 --> 02:52:14.800]  kind of my own observations of the mentality in our country now uh to get
[02:52:14.800 --> 02:52:17.920]  to the country here's my observation i want to see if i could validate it with
[02:52:17.920 --> 02:52:22.560]  uh obviously a very high ranking official here's the kind of what i think
[02:52:22.560 --> 02:52:26.800]  is that if you you know if you pay attention to the the news that had come
[02:52:26.800 --> 02:52:30.640]  out you know a couple some days ago they hit it late
[02:52:30.640 --> 02:52:34.960]  they go out and they just come up with a complete fatal everybody in the house
[02:52:34.960 --> 02:52:39.200]  has it gone there's a 40 minute firefight you know and it's in the whole
[02:52:39.200 --> 02:52:44.560]  story unravels but what i think and what it seems to me is that really all that
[02:52:44.560 --> 02:52:48.160]  matters and i wanted to know if this is the strategy is just whatever we say
[02:52:48.160 --> 02:52:52.400]  first is what the public will believe we can say whatever we want at first
[02:52:52.400 --> 02:52:56.480]  because as the details come out it's going to be shrugged off and once the
[02:52:56.480 --> 02:53:01.120]  mainstream whore media the dying dinosaur signs on to a lie
[02:53:01.120 --> 02:53:05.360]  they're now committed to go along with it uh uh the dr patik uh what's your
[02:53:05.360 --> 02:53:09.440]  comment on what rich is saying i think you both articulated brilliantly i think
[02:53:09.440 --> 02:53:12.720]  you're correct whatever they say first is what they think and then the dying
[02:53:12.720 --> 02:53:17.360]  dinosaur goes along with the lie and they're both going to become extinct
[02:53:17.360 --> 02:53:20.960]  that's what happens anything else rich dinosaur yeah well yeah whatever they
[02:53:20.960 --> 02:53:25.280]  say first is the so-called reality uh also if you'll allow me a couple of
[02:53:25.280 --> 02:53:27.520]  seconds just a brief year
[02:53:27.520 --> 02:53:30.720]  uh... so i had a conversation with a woman at work like i said this is a
[02:53:30.720 --> 02:53:33.600]  little off topic but it illustrates the mindset
[02:53:33.600 --> 02:53:36.720]  talking about organic food with a woman at work
[02:53:36.720 --> 02:53:40.240]  this woman that i work with literally believed i laughed at her she literally
[02:53:40.240 --> 02:53:44.720]  believed that you should not go organic because she was led to believe
[02:53:44.720 --> 02:53:49.120]  by going organic and meaning even food cosmetic dealer shampoo everything
[02:53:49.120 --> 02:53:52.720]  that it lowers your body's immune system that's the opposite it's the
[02:53:52.720 --> 02:53:56.240]  opposite when you when your body is no question when you're a doctor tell us
[02:53:56.240 --> 02:53:59.120]  that document i mean is it good to have to live in a bubble
[02:53:59.120 --> 02:54:03.840]  and then the organic systems the natural uh products are anti-oxidants they
[02:54:03.840 --> 02:54:07.440]  help our immune systems collectively uh a friend of mine
[02:54:07.440 --> 02:54:12.320]  my partner john neustead and i have that the website nbi health and
[02:54:12.320 --> 02:54:18.000]  we produce products for natural uh a health like osteo k for osteoporosis
[02:54:18.000 --> 02:54:21.600]  but that's totally opposite well i mean if that was true the bubble boy
[02:54:21.600 --> 02:54:24.320]  wouldn't have been sick and had to live in a bubble because he had no immune
[02:54:24.320 --> 02:54:29.520]  system you need to have people that have dogs their immune system gets better
[02:54:29.520 --> 02:54:33.280]  yeah but i thank you for the comment but the point about who says things first
[02:54:33.280 --> 02:54:36.800]  does stick but unfortunately in modern times that they're reverting
[02:54:36.800 --> 02:54:40.560]  back to its stories that make no sense after they've made that first
[02:54:40.560 --> 02:54:44.880]  idiotic statement so you know by the way doc since you
[02:54:44.880 --> 02:54:47.840]  since you raised that because you won't let me plug your books or anything you're
[02:54:47.840 --> 02:54:52.720]  doing i'm glad you brought up your big passion uh your uh your health products
[02:54:52.720 --> 02:54:56.560]  uh some of which uh you know i mean go directly to doctors tell folks about
[02:54:56.560 --> 02:54:59.920]  your health website well it's it's called that uh
[02:54:59.920 --> 02:55:04.080]  nutritional biochemistry and years ago what i did in one of my businesses was i
[02:55:04.080 --> 02:55:07.520]  was very tired of watching women uh taking actinol
[02:55:07.520 --> 02:55:11.120]  phyzo maxim believe it and and noticing that there was an increased
[02:55:11.120 --> 02:55:15.120]  amount of esophageal bleeding uh cancer of the jaw
[02:55:15.120 --> 02:55:19.200]  and my partner and i john new said at nbi health dot com five years ago in
[02:55:19.200 --> 02:55:24.800]  bosnia montana we developed the product that was uh approved like the the the
[02:55:24.800 --> 02:55:28.240]  natural product is mk4 it's a former vitamin k2
[02:55:28.240 --> 02:55:34.160]  which does not clot and in japan it's in 1999 he was approved as a medicine
[02:55:34.160 --> 02:55:39.920]  for osteoporosis and i said my god uh this is what the american public needs
[02:55:39.920 --> 02:55:44.320]  we have 39 million women who have osteoporosis they have side effects they
[02:55:44.320 --> 02:55:49.200]  have pain they have joint pain and the actinol phyzo mech
[02:55:49.200 --> 02:55:54.320]  products have over 900 lawsuits which sadly feels propagating this product and
[02:55:54.320 --> 02:55:58.720]  i talked about movie stars who came out of the left and decided to make more
[02:55:58.720 --> 02:56:02.400]  money i said and my partner john new said at nbi health said
[02:56:02.400 --> 02:56:05.520]  we're going to produce this product and people are going to enjoy it so if you
[02:56:05.520 --> 02:56:09.760]  go to the nbi health site you'll see testimonials from women
[02:56:09.760 --> 02:56:14.400]  whom we didn't solicit anything saying how it's improved decreased their fracture
[02:56:14.400 --> 02:56:18.960]  rate how osteoporosis has improved the bone density has improved and what the
[02:56:18.960 --> 02:56:24.960]  product really does it's a natural vitamin k2 which increases the collagen
[02:56:24.960 --> 02:56:28.720]  strength of the bone not just bone density because bone density in and of
[02:56:28.720 --> 02:56:32.640]  itself doesn't mean very much and most of the products
[02:56:32.640 --> 02:56:37.440]  that you see only increase fractures by 16 percent or prevent fractures by 50
[02:56:37.440 --> 02:56:40.400]  percent calcium and vitamin d is not sufficient
[02:56:40.400 --> 02:56:43.280]  so that's what i did but i i don't want to minimize
[02:56:43.280 --> 02:56:47.440]  what we've been talking about and i made a specific purpose but alex was so kind
[02:56:47.440 --> 02:56:51.360]  and so generous that he offered to allow us to
[02:56:51.360 --> 02:56:55.920]  one publicize on your site he that was not an initial condition so for truth
[02:56:55.920 --> 02:56:59.200]  and honesty and secondly he's asked me to
[02:56:59.200 --> 02:57:03.680]  discuss a little bit about osteoporosis but uh i think uh
[02:57:03.680 --> 02:57:07.520]  that the audience should really look at our website read the references read
[02:57:07.520 --> 02:57:10.960]  what's there in terms of what we discovered and
[02:57:10.960 --> 02:57:15.120]  the japanese ministry of health mandated that as a medicine
[02:57:15.120 --> 02:57:20.000]  uh and i think that'll be very helpful but i'd like to get back to the
[02:57:20.000 --> 02:57:22.880]  political absolutely now i've already had you for an hour and
[02:57:22.880 --> 02:57:27.200]  55 minutes i only want to do fuck it going out no no no honestly i enjoyed
[02:57:27.200 --> 02:57:30.400]  this as much as you know this is so important to me
[02:57:30.400 --> 02:57:34.080]  that i thought i have to tell the audience why alex is important to me
[02:57:34.080 --> 02:57:38.720]  at a time when when i came out 10 years ago i i didn't look for any publicity as
[02:57:38.720 --> 02:57:41.760]  alex knows and i'm not really interested in publicity
[02:57:41.760 --> 02:57:46.320]  i had gone on tv shows at that after 9 11 and explained what happened and
[02:57:46.320 --> 02:57:49.440]  the most of the mainstream media was really a disaster
[02:57:49.440 --> 02:57:54.000]  as you subsequently learn but alex jones was kind enough to put me on the
[02:57:54.000 --> 02:57:57.760]  radio show and and i said at that time this was a false flag
[02:57:57.760 --> 02:58:01.600]  uh it was a stand down this is a classical technique that's been used
[02:58:01.600 --> 02:58:04.400]  for years alex knew about it the audience knew about it
[02:58:04.400 --> 02:58:08.240]  but everybody of course put me in a category of sangy's kook he's crazy
[02:58:08.240 --> 02:58:12.080]  or basically he's a right winger or he's a conspiracy theorist
[02:58:12.080 --> 02:58:16.400]  fortunately enough kenny rumsfeld and those i worked with the neopons kept
[02:58:16.400 --> 02:58:19.920]  their mouths shut because i warned them if they had anything to say it would get
[02:58:19.920 --> 02:58:23.760]  more and more drastic and they'd learned the lesson then
[02:58:23.760 --> 02:58:28.400]  robert gates was brought in fortunately because bush senior was an incredible
[02:58:28.400 --> 02:58:32.000]  statesman understood that it was junior was out of control
[02:58:32.000 --> 02:58:36.320]  but let's jump forward now uh a two stay there sir back in one minute and

[03:00:17.040 --> 03:00:20.800]  network we got to get dr pacinic back on because
[03:00:20.800 --> 03:00:23.760]  every time he tells me something i'm gonna look it up and it's true he was
[03:00:23.760 --> 03:00:26.160]  talking about when he was at the rand corporation he was the main guy
[03:00:26.160 --> 03:00:31.120]  developing the takedown plan for the soviet union via afghanistan with
[03:00:31.120 --> 03:00:34.720]  berzensky uh i mean the stories this guy could tell
[03:00:34.720 --> 03:00:38.240]  because you got the big national russian tv calling up wanting to get all the
[03:00:38.240 --> 03:00:41.280]  pacinic to have him on i said why don't they want you on he goes well because i
[03:00:41.280 --> 03:00:44.800]  helped bring him down uh dr pacinic you know we'll give you a
[03:00:44.800 --> 03:00:47.280]  break for a few weeks but i want to get you back on
[03:00:47.280 --> 03:00:50.960]  to just talk about taking me back next week if you want to but basically the
[03:00:50.960 --> 03:00:55.360]  takedown of the soviet union was done at the request of dr richard soloman who
[03:00:55.360 --> 03:00:57.680]  was then the head of the rand corporation i have nothing to do with
[03:00:57.680 --> 03:01:02.800]  berzensky and he asked me to develop a a plan which is 153 pages on
[03:01:02.800 --> 03:01:06.880]  psychological determinants for the takedown of the soviet union and i used
[03:01:06.880 --> 03:01:12.400]  the rock and roll the pope who was very very helpful to us uh the military
[03:01:12.400 --> 03:01:16.800]  budget sd i reagan was exceedingly helpful we worked with him and then
[03:01:16.800 --> 03:01:21.200]  reagan brought me back in and i worked with some members of the cia one was
[03:01:21.200 --> 03:01:25.280]  the chair mat who is now open but there were a lot of members of the cia don
[03:01:25.280 --> 03:01:29.680]  gregg jim lily who were very famous operatives and became ambassadors and
[03:01:29.680 --> 03:01:33.280]  we were all involved in that lock uh we're all involved in the takedown of
[03:01:33.280 --> 03:01:37.280]  the soviet union but he was not given to us we literally had a program
[03:01:37.280 --> 03:01:40.080]  uh in the first hundred days to take down the soviet union
[03:01:40.080 --> 03:01:44.160]  brzezinski pick up on that plan because i know i mean i i mean uh you were you
[03:01:44.160 --> 03:01:47.120]  were in the white house when brzezinski was there correct or at that time i
[03:01:47.120 --> 03:01:50.080]  don't know i was in in the state department brzezinski was actually
[03:01:50.080 --> 03:01:53.440]  attacking the man i was working with who was a wonderful secretary of state
[03:01:53.440 --> 03:01:57.760]  cyrus fans internally we had a very major fight between brzezinski
[03:01:57.760 --> 03:02:02.240]  and uh cyrus fans i have nothing against brzezinski i think he's a very smart
[03:02:02.240 --> 03:02:06.000]  individual but i was in the state department at the time and the war was
[03:02:06.000 --> 03:02:10.480]  between brzezinski carter couldn't control it i worked for warren christopher
[03:02:10.480 --> 03:02:15.040]  and cyrus fans and he was a very nice gentleman and then i worked on camp david
[03:02:15.040 --> 03:02:18.880]  and carter really deserves the credit for that as the cyrus fans and warren
[03:02:18.880 --> 03:02:21.760]  christopher and unfortunately warren christopher just died a
[03:02:21.760 --> 03:02:25.440]  month ago a very great deputy secretary of state and also a great
[03:02:25.440 --> 03:02:28.880]  secretary of state he was a democrat and as i said to you both democrats
[03:02:28.880 --> 03:02:33.520]  republicans are are capable and are are are also incompetent
[03:02:33.520 --> 03:02:38.080]  all right let's quickly jam in two more quick question from janice in minnesota
[03:02:38.080 --> 03:02:43.040]  and then dav quick question janice okay i don't have a quick question i i heard
[03:02:43.040 --> 03:02:46.560]  you um dr pacenek on the
[03:02:46.560 --> 03:02:50.880]  coast to coast the other night and i was very shocked at the comment you made
[03:02:50.880 --> 03:02:54.640]  um you started talking about politics i understand you're quite the you know
[03:02:54.640 --> 03:02:58.720]  insider and so on as far as your knowledge and i do respect that
[03:02:58.720 --> 03:03:02.560]  however when you said that the greatest president that we
[03:03:02.560 --> 03:03:06.160]  have had in modern times is herbert uh walker
[03:03:06.160 --> 03:03:11.680]  jork uh bush the senior uh i was just quite taken aback because here he is
[03:03:11.680 --> 03:03:15.520]  that he was ahead of cia and in no i got your question we got to move
[03:03:15.520 --> 03:03:18.560]  uh what's what's your statement when i said let me just
[03:03:18.560 --> 03:03:22.960]  correct it for me i was asked who did i think for me
[03:03:22.960 --> 03:03:27.040]  was the most important president in terms of foreign policy and i said
[03:03:27.040 --> 03:03:30.560]  i felt he was very seriously undervalued
[03:03:30.560 --> 03:03:33.280]  and really nobody talked about what he had to come
[03:03:33.280 --> 03:03:37.520]  you're saying compared to obama and junior and clinton and all these people
[03:03:37.520 --> 03:03:40.960]  yeah i mean he was really quite effective and very modest
[03:03:40.960 --> 03:03:45.040]  you never heard of what he did and he did a lot took down a prospect to get the
[03:03:45.040 --> 03:03:48.080]  other thing he was involved in the takedown of the soviet union he was
[03:03:48.080 --> 03:03:51.760]  involved in the takedown of debutson he was involved in the takedown in
[03:03:51.760 --> 03:03:54.880]  gistu he was involved in the takedown of noriega i mean
[03:03:54.880 --> 03:03:59.280]  but this gentleman did quietly and he was involved in the ethiopian
[03:03:59.280 --> 03:04:04.160]  uh... uh... uh... movement and he is i mean this man did a lot in foreign
[03:04:04.160 --> 03:04:08.560]  policy and never said a word he and brent scope were amazing
[03:04:08.560 --> 03:04:11.520]  and so we do have presidents who are quite
[03:04:11.520 --> 03:04:15.120]  uh distinguished whether you like it or not what he did domestically is another
[03:04:15.120 --> 03:04:19.040]  issue i'm just talking from my point of view i'm not an inside right quite
[03:04:19.040 --> 03:04:23.040]  frankly i'm an outside i was never invited anybody's meals i'm not invited
[03:04:23.040 --> 03:04:26.240]  to anybody despite the fact everybody thinks i'm in the cfr
[03:04:26.240 --> 03:04:30.160]  which i am i'm also a member of the association former intelligence operatives
[03:04:30.160 --> 03:04:32.880]  national military intelligence association

[03:08:02.640 --> 03:08:09.920]  amazing two-plus hour long live interview with dr steve pacenic steve pacenic
[03:08:09.920 --> 03:08:14.160]  dot com we're going to talk to uh just davin long island that's going to be it
[03:08:14.160 --> 03:08:20.080]  for calls but before we go today this final caller uh what is tom clancy
[03:08:20.080 --> 03:08:23.760]  think about what you're doing uh because uh i was reading the synopsis of
[03:08:23.760 --> 03:08:30.080]  coast to coast am a few nights ago uh when you were on i guess it would be uh
[03:08:30.080 --> 03:08:34.240]  tuesday night i read some of the synopsis yesterday was unable
[03:08:34.240 --> 03:08:37.600]  to listen because i had to get some shut i because you were on late
[03:08:37.600 --> 03:08:42.080]  but uh the quote i saw was that uh you were talking about you're working on
[03:08:42.080 --> 03:08:45.760]  some new books with tom clancy but what's what's tom clancy's
[03:08:45.760 --> 03:08:50.000]  view of you can i mean i not speak for him but uh on speak for tom i haven't
[03:08:50.000 --> 03:08:54.560]  talked to him in a while but basically tom is a very realistic smart
[03:08:54.560 --> 03:08:58.080]  individual who understands psychological warfare
[03:08:58.080 --> 03:09:01.440]  he's also very funny what i said i mean when you work with them
[03:09:01.440 --> 03:09:07.440]  isn't exceedingly uh smart uh witty individual who understands the dynamics
[03:09:07.440 --> 03:09:12.720]  of what's going on i can't speak on his behalf i haven't seen him in a while
[03:09:12.720 --> 03:09:17.760]  but he's uh you know i really don't know what he thinks right now in terms of
[03:09:17.760 --> 03:09:25.040]  uh obama and osama and quite frankly uh the books we worked on uh the various
[03:09:25.040 --> 03:09:29.360]  books prior to that and the books that he had you know there was always a sense
[03:09:29.360 --> 03:09:33.360]  of human reality testing which is lacking in this country right now
[03:09:33.360 --> 03:09:38.000]  number one we do have a need of humor on behalf of some of the people who take
[03:09:38.000 --> 03:09:40.720]  themselves so seriously they're very pretentious
[03:09:40.720 --> 03:09:44.320]  particularly our political leaders uh you know whether it's the head of the
[03:09:44.320 --> 03:09:49.040]  republican party the democratic party they seem to be very pompous and
[03:09:49.040 --> 03:09:53.600]  self-righteous and good god you know every pronouncement sounds as if this
[03:09:53.600 --> 03:09:58.400]  is a this was from the words of god and at the same time somebody pointed out
[03:09:58.400 --> 03:10:03.200]  correctly your your listeners that obama doesn't seem to be there
[03:10:03.200 --> 03:10:07.440]  and it seems to be a what i call it dissociation between the man
[03:10:07.440 --> 03:10:11.440]  and his emotions he's got a very flat aspect but we call very
[03:10:11.440 --> 03:10:15.360]  flat and people pick that up it's almost as if he's not connected to the
[03:10:15.360 --> 03:10:20.240]  message he's saying yet when he's on the uh trail he just loves to shake hands
[03:10:20.240 --> 03:10:26.000]  but be it as it may uh you know people will have different perspectives as to
[03:10:26.000 --> 03:10:30.000]  what tom thinks i really don't know you'd have to interview him and and
[03:10:30.000 --> 03:10:33.600]  it would be interesting to hear let me throw this out there because you are
[03:10:33.600 --> 03:10:36.640]  a psychiatrist and a psych warfare expert
[03:10:36.640 --> 03:10:40.240]  myself individually obviously when i was 25
[03:10:40.240 --> 03:10:45.280]  i wanted to impress women uh but that was about it i don't like awards or
[03:10:45.280 --> 03:10:48.560]  attention i mean i do this because it's a mission i don't
[03:10:48.560 --> 03:10:51.200]  like tyranny i don't like bullies running my life
[03:10:51.200 --> 03:10:54.880]  i'd rather go fishing and hang out with my kids and you know play tennis or
[03:10:54.880 --> 03:10:58.640]  whatever or oil paint with them and as i've gotten a little
[03:10:58.640 --> 03:11:01.840]  more power and a little more influence and learn more
[03:11:01.840 --> 03:11:06.160]  i get more and more humble and more and more freaked out by
[03:11:06.160 --> 03:11:09.920]  you know tenuous uh transitory human power
[03:11:09.920 --> 03:11:14.880]  but then i study these elites and on average they love award ceremonies they
[03:11:14.880 --> 03:11:18.640]  love primping and posing uh the more power they get they
[03:11:18.640 --> 03:11:22.720]  relish the crowds they relish the applause when i walk out to two thousand
[03:11:22.720 --> 03:11:26.960]  people and they people are crying and clapping it's like embarrassing because
[03:11:26.960 --> 03:11:30.240]  i realize i'm just human and i'm going my god i better do a good job
[03:11:30.240 --> 03:11:34.160]  these people are looking up to me that seems like a normal you know i guess in
[03:11:34.160 --> 03:11:37.840]  the hierarchy of needs perspective now all i want
[03:11:37.840 --> 03:11:41.760]  is a future for my children and for them to have a future with other people
[03:11:41.760 --> 03:11:47.200]  i you know have gone to that pure mode of of of seeing how short life is
[03:11:47.200 --> 03:11:50.080]  understanding that we're all part of a larger community
[03:11:50.080 --> 03:11:54.800]  and then i see the worldliness of the merger of hollywood and politics and
[03:11:54.800 --> 03:11:59.200]  these people relishing it and you know you're calling it narcissism but it
[03:11:59.200 --> 03:12:04.080]  seems to go beyond that and and i don't mean to talk about myself
[03:12:04.080 --> 03:12:07.920]  but just analyzing my position that as you get more power
[03:12:07.920 --> 03:12:12.640]  you tend to to become more humble but then i look at most people in power
[03:12:12.640 --> 03:12:16.080]  they become more arrogant more wild more
[03:12:16.080 --> 03:12:20.400]  reckless with hubris but but i realize as you get more power
[03:12:20.400 --> 03:12:24.480]  uh that that like spider-man says with great power comes great
[03:12:24.480 --> 03:12:28.160]  responsibility now i'm still you know decisive from
[03:12:28.160 --> 03:12:31.440]  research and you have to be decisive but that comes from research and and
[03:12:31.440 --> 03:12:34.640]  already having preset you know decisions i've made
[03:12:34.640 --> 03:12:38.080]  but still it makes you nervous because if you make a mistake
[03:12:38.080 --> 03:12:42.640]  it has a bigger effect but these guys they just think power
[03:12:42.640 --> 03:12:48.560]  is the uh prime of fascia authorization to do whatever they want i mean you get
[03:12:48.560 --> 03:12:51.920]  where i'm going yes the the difference between you
[03:12:51.920 --> 03:12:56.320]  my friend and myself and them i don't i was promoted to
[03:12:56.320 --> 03:12:59.680]  brigadier general status i was seven i turned it down
[03:12:59.680 --> 03:13:03.520]  i was asked to go on and i turned all of that down just like you did i was not
[03:13:03.520 --> 03:13:06.400]  interested the difference between you
[03:13:06.400 --> 03:13:10.400]  who's somebody who's very grounded understands what it is despite what the
[03:13:10.400 --> 03:13:14.240]  press will say you're a conspirator and all that that's nonsense
[03:13:14.240 --> 03:13:18.080]  the difference between you and the understanding where you came from
[03:13:18.080 --> 03:13:22.960]  and you're wanting to learn and the politician who wants to self-aggrandize
[03:13:22.960 --> 03:13:26.160]  is the difference between an american who's stable
[03:13:26.160 --> 03:13:31.200]  and a narcissist a politician who has to self-aggrandize and has nothing
[03:13:31.200 --> 03:13:34.640]  that he or she has accomplished so when you look at these
[03:13:34.640 --> 03:13:37.520]  politicians you're really looking at movie stars
[03:13:37.520 --> 03:13:41.680]  the the problem i had on on television or creating television shows or even
[03:13:41.680 --> 03:13:44.960]  novels is that the movie stars the least important person
[03:13:44.960 --> 03:13:48.480]  they're the ones who are saying your words i either writer's words and the
[03:13:48.480 --> 03:13:52.640]  creator or the executive producer where they think they're really the center of
[03:13:52.640 --> 03:13:55.520]  attraction well the problem with narcissist and
[03:13:55.520 --> 03:13:58.960]  its belated narcissism is that these politicians
[03:13:58.960 --> 03:14:03.040]  genuinely genuinely believe after a while that they are important
[03:14:03.040 --> 03:14:06.560]  in fact if you take them away from their telephone
[03:14:06.560 --> 03:14:10.640]  and their position they are of no relevance so what happens they become
[03:14:10.640 --> 03:14:14.240]  so-called lobbyists and then they get money for nothing
[03:14:14.240 --> 03:14:18.240]  more than being egregious and pandering to the next level
[03:14:18.240 --> 03:14:22.800]  and this is what's happening we went from a product oriented country
[03:14:22.800 --> 03:14:26.560]  to assist a very sensible country of real people
[03:14:26.560 --> 03:14:31.360]  producing real products to a country of process producing nothing more than
[03:14:31.360 --> 03:14:35.120]  process and paper pushing and individuals who are
[03:14:35.120 --> 03:14:39.520]  intercessors for intercessors with nothing more for their sense of
[03:14:39.520 --> 03:14:44.160]  self-worth than the fact that they were deputy to the deputy to the deputy of
[03:14:44.160 --> 03:14:47.680]  the deputy and this is out of control and this
[03:14:47.680 --> 03:14:52.000]  is what's happened that's why the only institution that i can respect
[03:14:52.000 --> 03:14:56.240]  within the american hierarchical system is really the military
[03:14:56.240 --> 03:14:59.520]  why because it's very tough to be on the ground
[03:14:59.520 --> 03:15:04.000]  and fighting and having a sense of discipline and self-discipline
[03:15:04.000 --> 03:15:07.280]  and being shot at and caring about whether you are
[03:15:07.280 --> 03:15:11.120]  a captain or a major you really have to go through the system
[03:15:11.120 --> 03:15:14.320]  and you really have to be accountable for life and death
[03:15:14.320 --> 03:15:18.480]  that's why you and i have respect for physicians we have respect for those who
[03:15:18.480 --> 03:15:21.920]  create you know whether it's a person who writes
[03:15:21.920 --> 03:15:26.160]  drives a truck his responsibilities make sure that he can deliver the goods
[03:15:26.160 --> 03:15:30.320]  or whether it's a mechanic or whether it's anybody doesn't matter what it is
[03:15:30.320 --> 03:15:34.720]  there is no one in your audience who's going to advance him or herself on the
[03:15:34.720 --> 03:15:38.320]  basis of saying how important they think they should be
[03:15:38.320 --> 03:15:42.080]  the only ones who do that are really by definition sociopaths
[03:15:42.080 --> 03:15:46.080]  because they have no sense of guilt they have no sense of consequence so they
[03:15:46.080 --> 03:15:49.200]  can say anything they want the president is a typical
[03:15:49.200 --> 03:15:52.960]  example of that be it this president a democrat
[03:15:52.960 --> 03:15:56.880]  or a republican like bush jr who had no sense of self
[03:15:56.880 --> 03:16:01.680]  where you know at consequences had never performed successfully in any of these
[03:16:01.680 --> 03:16:04.720]  feet and then you have clinton who clearly was
[03:16:04.720 --> 03:16:08.560]  filleted in the white house how much sociopath can you have there
[03:16:08.560 --> 03:16:12.880]  then you have his wife who can tell you the broadest lies in the world
[03:16:12.880 --> 03:16:16.800]  and then still tell you how important she feels she is and writes a book that
[03:16:16.800 --> 03:16:20.080]  she never even wrote so we have created a culture of
[03:16:20.080 --> 03:16:23.600]  sociopathy which is more dangerous just narcissism
[03:16:23.600 --> 03:16:26.960]  and that's what makes the difference between the alex jonesow
[03:16:26.960 --> 03:16:31.040]  and the audience and the american government that so-called represent that
[03:16:31.040 --> 03:16:34.160]  they don't represent us it's not real anymore they're in the wizard of
[03:16:34.160 --> 03:16:37.600]  vahs the wizard of sociopathy they are now
[03:16:37.600 --> 03:16:42.160]  really sociopaths who are doing nothing more than self-aggrandizing
[03:16:42.160 --> 03:16:46.640]  expanding and extending extending their own narcissism when you talk about
