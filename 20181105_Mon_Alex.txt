[00:00:23.707 --> 00:00:48.060]  I'm watching the midterms, then you would think our country is Mad Max Thunderdunk.
[00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:51.722]  This guy is like, they're coming from Guatemala, they're coming from Mexico.
[00:00:55.711 --> 00:00:57.532]  There's a liberal mob that's coming.
[00:01:34.542 --> 00:01:38.425]  And you would think everybody in the country is just like, to the bunker.
[00:01:38.425 --> 00:01:51.914]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:01:55.788 --> 00:01:58.789]  These fabulations have been common on the fringes for years.
[00:01:58.789 --> 00:02:02.129]  George Soros' Open Society Foundation.
[00:02:02.129 --> 00:02:06.370]  But now, his name saturates nearly every corner of the GOP ecosystem.
[00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:13.152]  The longtime investor and philanthropist became the target of misinformation and conspiracies starting in the 1990s.
[00:02:13.152 --> 00:02:20.173]  Extremists in the US and Europe cast him as a central figure in a secret cabal of Jews and globalists working to take over the world.
[00:02:20.333 --> 00:02:25.195]  If the mainstream media actually began reporting facts again, they would quickly learn that the migrant caravans are not only a reality, but they are no accident.
[00:02:25.195 --> 00:02:27.176]  Back in July of 2018, Reuters reported on the 193 UN member nations
[00:02:46.983 --> 00:02:47.364]  We're good.
[00:03:02.205 --> 00:03:13.510]  The official global compact for safe, orderly, and regular migration addresses why people migrate, how to protect them, and how to integrate them into new countries.
[00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:21.274]  However, the United States, Poland, Hungary, Slovakia, Austria, and the Czech Republic have pulled out of the pact.
[00:03:21.274 --> 00:03:21.955]  The U.S.
[00:03:21.955 --> 00:03:29.058]  had previously entered into the pact under Barack Obama, regardless of the fact that the pact violates our immigration laws.
[00:03:29.318 --> 00:03:38.001]  The PAC states that it is rooted in the UN's 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Addis Ababa Action Agenda.
[00:03:38.001 --> 00:03:42.542]  The Addis Ababa Action Agenda was a conference held in Ethiopia in July of 2015.
[00:03:42.542 --> 00:03:43.342]  This agenda stated,
[00:03:45.043 --> 00:03:54.310]  We will work to ensure that adequate and affordable financial services are available to migrants and their families in both home and host countries.
[00:03:54.310 --> 00:04:03.637]  These documents answer the question, how do a dozen Honduran migrants decide to sue the President of the United States of America and a handful of federal agencies
[00:04:06.431 --> 00:04:16.456]  And this is nothing new to Soros and USAID, who funneled money to aid Georgia's Rose Revolution in 2003, the Ukraine's Orange Revolution in 2004, and Kyrgyzstan's Tulip Revolution in 2005.
[00:04:35.026 --> 00:04:39.509]  Recently, Judicial Watch used a FOIA request to uncover how U.S.
[00:04:39.509 --> 00:04:47.755]  aid funds were funneled to Soros' left-wing Open Society foundations in Albania, particularly the Soros operation.
[00:04:47.755 --> 00:04:55.600]  Ladies and gentlemen, the name of this video is George Soros' Caravans Meet the InfoWalk.
[00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:56.501]  We're one day out.
[00:04:56.501 --> 00:04:57.922]  It's historic election coverage.
[00:04:57.922 --> 00:04:59.063]  Ted Nugent, straight ahead.
[00:05:00.285 --> 00:05:09.595]  The globalists know that if they suppress the good halogen and pump the environment full of the bad halogens, fluoride, chlorine, bromine, you name it, that it lowers IQ.
[00:05:09.595 --> 00:05:12.458]  It literally dumbs the population down.
[00:05:12.458 --> 00:05:18.504]  And on our quest to bring our listeners and viewers the best iodine in the world, we've gone through two permutations.
[00:05:19.165 --> 00:05:25.430]  First, seaweed-based iodine that was pretty good but hard to source, and the Globeless tried to block us getting a supply of it.
[00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:31.736]  So we discovered deep-earth crystals of pure nascent iodine and brought you X2 that's been incredible.
[00:05:31.736 --> 00:05:38.761]  Now, due to the Establisher trying to block that, we did more research and secured more of the deep-earth crystals of nascent iodine.
[00:05:38.761 --> 00:05:38.961]  But!
[00:05:39.802 --> 00:05:52.828]  Chemists, scientists, and others showed us the research that by combining it with three other compounds, two forms of iodine and vitamin C, it supercharges it and makes it even more bioavailable.
[00:05:52.828 --> 00:05:57.070]  Ladies and gentlemen, if you want to research it, you want to see it, it's an incredible discovery.
[00:05:57.070 --> 00:05:59.751]  X3, now available at mfulworthslife.com.
[00:06:07.510 --> 00:06:23.542]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the Infowar.
[00:06:23.542 --> 00:06:34.851]  We are now only one day out from what even the Financial Times of London is calling the most important election in world history, a referendum on nationalism versus globalism.
[00:06:36.243 --> 00:06:50.766]  And American hating forces around the world have come out of the woodwork to try to bring this country to its knees and stop the recovery before we can totally turn the nation around and prove they were trying to bankrupt us by design.
[00:06:50.766 --> 00:06:53.427]  Mike Adams has written a key report for InfoWars.com.
[00:06:53.427 --> 00:06:54.647]  It's on Natural News.
[00:06:54.647 --> 00:07:03.089]  Win or lose, it's time for America to push back against the incivility, lawlessness, and the fraud of the political left.
[00:07:03.709 --> 00:07:14.038]  Yes, the election meddling, the bullying, the foreign meddling, the racketeering, and Trump administration eyes big tech antitrust violations.
[00:07:14.038 --> 00:07:21.103]  CNBC, after the election, Trump is going to strike back and we've been quarterbacking that operation.
[00:07:21.103 --> 00:07:29.991]  Maxine Waters has sworn that if she gets control of the House Financial Services Committee, she will wreck the economy and stop the recovery.
[00:07:29.991 --> 00:07:32.012]  That is their main job.
[00:07:32.012 --> 00:07:32.373]  Also,
[00:07:33.882 --> 00:07:42.924]  Paul Joseph Watson has a key report up on Infowars.com that is so incredibly important.
[00:07:42.924 --> 00:07:52.685]  Shock Rasmussen poll puts Republicans one point ahead in race for Congress.
[00:07:52.685 --> 00:08:00.947]  You have to understand, all of these polling agencies, depending on the methodology poll, 9 to 15, some cases 20 points more
[00:08:04.429 --> 00:08:07.292]  For Democrats.
[00:08:07.292 --> 00:08:10.935]  They just believe that there are more Democrats than there are Republicans.
[00:08:10.935 --> 00:08:12.277]  That's not true.
[00:08:12.277 --> 00:08:22.246]  So when you've got Republicans in a National Scientific Rasmussen Poll one point ahead, that is massive, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:08:22.246 --> 00:08:24.888]  That signals a major red wave, but here's the problem.
[00:08:25.615 --> 00:08:37.583]  They have caught people from Texas to Maryland, Democrats organizing legal aliens to have mailed to their address absentee ballots in the name of dead people, stolen the rolls.
[00:08:37.583 --> 00:08:43.247]  You've got all sorts of foreign money and suppression and free speech suppression going on.
[00:08:43.247 --> 00:08:45.429]  So can the bullying and racketeering
[00:08:46.149 --> 00:08:50.291]  And the new Black Panther Party standing out front polling places with rifles.
[00:08:50.291 --> 00:08:52.532]  Can that intimidate people from voting?
[00:08:52.532 --> 00:08:55.774]  And will the Democrats be able to steal another election?
[00:08:55.774 --> 00:08:58.635]  Joining us is Ted Nugent for the next two segments.
[00:08:58.635 --> 00:09:06.719]  I can't think of a better way to have the Motor City Madman kick off our final day of coverage before this incredible election kicks off.
[00:09:06.719 --> 00:09:14.142]  And I gotta tell you, I'm not somebody that has anxiety or butterflies, but I gotta tell you, I am really on edge.
[00:09:14.142 --> 00:09:14.863]  You can cut the
[00:09:15.743 --> 00:09:18.227]  Cut the energy with a knife.
[00:09:18.227 --> 00:09:24.436]  We're going to be talking about all this with Ted Nugent and get his prediction of what's going to happen tomorrow.
[00:09:24.436 --> 00:09:25.218]  Ted, thanks for coming on.
[00:09:26.252 --> 00:09:27.432]  My pleasure, Alex.
[00:09:27.432 --> 00:09:30.813]  Happy November 5th to you, and thanks for being on the front lines.
[00:09:30.813 --> 00:09:35.394]  If I may just state that this isn't just a Ted Nugent opinion.
[00:09:35.394 --> 00:09:37.055]  Again, I'm a gregarious guy.
[00:09:37.055 --> 00:09:51.238]  We have hunting camps full of great families up here in the swamps and forests of Michigan, and we want you to know, Alex, that we believe the Founding Fathers wanted all Americans to be like Alex Jones, and we the people
[00:09:52.158 --> 00:10:00.645]  Thank you for being a hell raiser.
[00:10:00.645 --> 00:10:04.288]  We the people are supposed to be hell raisers.
[00:10:04.288 --> 00:10:05.709]  We're not supposed to be French.
[00:10:05.709 --> 00:10:07.090]  We're not supposed to be British.
[00:10:07.090 --> 00:10:08.791]  We're not supposed to be German.
[00:10:08.791 --> 00:10:12.234]  We're supposed to be free Americans raising hell.
[00:10:12.974 --> 00:10:19.818]  Questioning authority every minute of the day, and spotlighting cockroaches, and stomping on them.
[00:10:19.818 --> 00:10:30.344]  So Alex Jones, thank you on behalf of we the people that know that freedom is not free, and if you're not a Hellraiser, you're bending over and taking it from Hellraiser.
[00:10:30.344 --> 00:10:37.388]  So God bless you, never ever give up, never back down, never give in, never surrender, and be Alex Jones like you mean it.
[00:10:38.174 --> 00:10:39.997]  Wow, well be Ted Nugent like you meant it.
[00:10:39.997 --> 00:10:41.139]  All of that back at you, my friend.
[00:10:41.139 --> 00:10:43.463]  Let me ask you this fundamental question.
[00:10:43.463 --> 00:10:45.586]  You've talked for 45, 50 years.
[00:10:45.586 --> 00:10:50.654]  You really were the first person for the relaunch of the Republic to bring back Americana when it wasn't cool in the 60s.
[00:10:52.028 --> 00:10:57.289]  To recognize that leftists hated America, and literally had a vendetta against it.
[00:10:57.289 --> 00:11:07.771]  Now, when a member of CNBC says we appreciate a Navy SEAL service that lost his eye, when the left is making fun of him losing his eye, she gets in trouble.
[00:11:07.771 --> 00:11:14.092]  I mean, you go to a Democrat event, and you say America's back, and they literally kiss and boo.
[00:11:14.092 --> 00:11:15.732]  What is wrong with these people?
[00:11:15.732 --> 00:11:19.173]  How did they get brainwashed into this position, and as they're
[00:11:20.634 --> 00:11:23.755]  Numbers grow as they bring in more people to brainwash.
[00:11:23.755 --> 00:11:25.637]  Where does all this end?
[00:11:25.637 --> 00:11:45.729]  You know, it's impossible to really analyze the system and the procedure by which people can lose their soul to the degree where an American, an actual born American, is upset by a Donald Trump statement of America first.
[00:11:46.549 --> 00:11:57.256]  All you need to know about Robert O'Rourke down there in Texas, and Debbie Stabenow up here in Michigan, it's very interesting, Alex, that I have a foot in both camps.
[00:11:57.256 --> 00:12:15.769]  I'm here in my beloved birth state of Michigan, which I truly love, and we have a hunting season here to celebrate every year for 70 years, and then I'm a resident of Texas, which is the front lines, where the left dreams that they can turn Texas
[00:12:16.649 --> 00:12:18.389]  Into California.
[00:12:18.389 --> 00:12:43.894]  So the observation should never be predicated upon our desire or need to understand how you lose your soul, how an American can hate the battle cry of America first, how the media and Beto O'Rourke and the Hillary Clintons and the gun-running Barack Obama and Eric Holders of the world can actually insert the word white
[00:12:44.754 --> 00:12:49.157]  Into Donald Trump's statement that he loves America because he's a nationalist.
[00:12:49.157 --> 00:12:50.498]  He loves America.
[00:12:50.498 --> 00:12:56.863]  He loves everybody in America, no matter race, color, creed, gender confusion, ethnicity.
[00:12:56.863 --> 00:13:03.367]  No separation of why Donald Trump and Alex Jones and Ted Nugent love America.
[00:13:03.367 --> 00:13:04.868]  We are nationalists.
[00:13:04.868 --> 00:13:08.631]  We love America more than we love the rest of the world.
[00:13:08.631 --> 00:13:11.333]  And then the lying scum
[00:13:12.196 --> 00:13:17.744]  The anti-journalist fake news masters of Don Lemon and all the left.
[00:13:17.744 --> 00:13:26.416]  They literally take Donald Trump's statement that I love America, I'm an American nationalist, and they insert the word white.
[00:13:27.449 --> 00:13:31.252]  Nobody ever said they were a white nationalist.
[00:13:31.252 --> 00:13:36.635]  Nobody ever said all the immigrants are rapists and murderers and thieves and drug runners.
[00:13:36.635 --> 00:13:46.282]  The only people that Donald Trump called rapists and murderers and thieves and drug runners were the rapists and thieves and murderers and drug runners.
[00:13:46.282 --> 00:13:54.228]  Yet the left, just like the hands-up-don't-shoot lie, they have to lie and then their sheep
[00:13:54.848 --> 00:14:05.151]  Blindly follow them, but Alex, you will have an aneurysm if you try to determine how a person loses their soul.
[00:14:05.151 --> 00:14:11.212]  So instead of trying to come up with some kind of logic that doesn't exist... Just defeat them!
[00:14:11.212 --> 00:14:12.492]  Just defeat them!
[00:14:12.492 --> 00:14:15.253]  We need to galvanize everybody in our lives.
[00:14:15.253 --> 00:14:17.874]  Church, school, the workplace, the family gatherings.
[00:14:17.874 --> 00:14:18.834]  We're in a fight!
[00:14:18.834 --> 00:14:19.854]  And we need to fix liberals!
[00:14:20.219 --> 00:14:24.461]  We're in a war, and we're about to go to break one more segment, and I appreciate your time, but I wanted to ask you this.
[00:14:24.461 --> 00:14:42.010]  Brett Kavanaugh, a third woman has come out, because they're about to get indicted, and said, I totally made it up, but she said, I never even met him, but it's okay, because she said, I just wanted to use it as a tactic to ruin his wife, his children, try to ruin his life, but as soon as they failed, they just withdrew it, and now they've been caught making it up.
[00:14:43.763 --> 00:14:45.405]  Sure, but they've been doing that about me.
[00:14:45.405 --> 00:14:51.734]  I mean, the Huffington Post actually wrote a story that I adopted a 13-year-old to have sex with her.
[00:14:52.768 --> 00:14:56.549]  Alex, where the hell do they come up with this stuff?
[00:14:56.549 --> 00:14:57.349]  And you know why?
[00:14:57.349 --> 00:15:04.431]  They say that against me in the protection of their First Amendment maneuvers because they can't debate me.
[00:15:04.431 --> 00:15:08.812]  They've seen when leftists try to debate Ted Nugent and get their ass handed to them.
[00:15:08.812 --> 00:15:09.592]  Ted, I looked into that.
[00:15:09.592 --> 00:15:10.433]  It's totally made up.
[00:15:10.433 --> 00:15:15.414]  They say that I say that there are Martian slave colonies on the moon.
[00:15:15.414 --> 00:15:16.074]  Never said it.
[00:15:18.249 --> 00:15:27.396]  You gotta admit this, if you can get past the insanity and the cruelty and the soullessness of the left, it's some funny, funny stuff.
[00:15:27.396 --> 00:15:34.521]  I know, it's like, they publish an article that I wear Nazi tennis shoes around the office.
[00:15:34.521 --> 00:15:35.522]  That's how they operate.
[00:15:35.522 --> 00:15:37.884]  They're liars, they're fake newsmasters.
[00:15:37.884 --> 00:15:40.125]  I've been dealing with it since the 1960s.
[00:15:40.125 --> 00:15:44.429]  They hated me because I believe in the Second Amendment and I eat venison.
[00:15:44.429 --> 00:15:47.271]  Just for that, I'm gonna buy more guns and kill more deer.
[00:15:48.010 --> 00:15:51.959]  Let's talk about other key issues straight ahead with The Man.
[00:15:51.959 --> 00:15:53.342]  Dead News and I'm Alex Jones.
[00:15:53.342 --> 00:15:54.264]  Spread the live links.
[00:15:54.264 --> 00:15:55.567]  Break the censors back.
[00:15:55.567 --> 00:15:56.208]  Infowars.com.
[00:15:56.208 --> 00:15:57.170]  Forwards slash show.
[00:15:57.170 --> 00:15:57.691]  Live coverage.
[00:15:59.378 --> 00:16:03.260]  Most of you know that heart disease is the number one silent killer in the U.S.
[00:16:03.260 --> 00:16:08.243]  What if I told you for just $54.95 a month you could fight against heart disease naturally?
[00:16:08.243 --> 00:16:13.066]  At Heart and Body Extract, we've been helping thousands of people get back to a healthier heart.
[00:16:13.066 --> 00:16:14.427]  Don't just take my word for it.

[00:16:20.111 --> 00:16:22.592]  Don't risk it when you can take charge of it.
[00:16:29.216 --> 00:16:33.999]  In these uncertain times, it makes sense to have a sustainable backup method to cook food and boil water.
[00:16:33.999 --> 00:16:39.883]  If your current plan includes using a fuel-burning stove or cooking over an open fire, then there's a much better way.
[00:16:39.883 --> 00:16:46.408]  The Minuteman Rocket Stove is a biomass-burning cooking stove that only requires small quantities of sticks and twigs for fuel.
[00:16:46.408 --> 00:16:50.450]  The Minuteman Stove is easy to use, smokeless, portable, powerful, and sustainable.

[00:16:59.096 --> 00:17:02.719]  What if there was a social media network only for the conservative?
[00:17:02.719 --> 00:17:10.084]  What if there was a social media network not only for the conservative right general public, but also a platform for conservative politicians and advertisers?
[00:17:10.084 --> 00:17:14.987]  And what if this social media network was the only free speech network in existence?
[00:17:14.987 --> 00:17:15.828]  There is.
[00:17:15.828 --> 00:17:17.409]  It's RightSocial.net.
[00:17:17.409 --> 00:17:18.770]  RightSocial.net.
[00:17:18.770 --> 00:17:22.092]  A response to President Donald Trump's direct presidential order.
[00:17:22.092 --> 00:17:23.393]  RightSocial.net.
[00:17:23.393 --> 00:17:25.615]  Where you have the right to freely speak your mind.
[00:17:25.615 --> 00:17:26.956]  RightSocial.net.
[00:17:26.956 --> 00:17:28.237]  The right place to be.
[00:17:28.877 --> 00:17:35.222]  The United States of Empire is a book that claims the United States is the empire of the world.
[00:17:35.222 --> 00:17:38.264]  George Washington had warned us against foreign wars.
[00:17:38.264 --> 00:17:44.189]  The United States of Empire shows that World Wars I and II left England broken.
[00:17:44.189 --> 00:17:47.972]  Its former colony, the U.S., had to save the empire.
[00:17:47.972 --> 00:17:49.253]  Was there ever a vote?
[00:17:49.253 --> 00:17:50.594]  Who do we fight for?
[00:17:50.594 --> 00:17:56.799]  The Deep State began with World War I. The United States of Empire by James Dunn.
[00:17:56.799 --> 00:17:58.220]  Available at Amazon Books.
[00:18:00.293 --> 00:18:03.876]  InfoWars Life is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine.
[00:18:03.876 --> 00:18:05.657]  Introducing Pollen Block.
[00:18:05.657 --> 00:18:17.705]  We have found an extraordinary new, natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms, including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort, and respiratory function.
[00:18:17.705 --> 00:18:22.729]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs,
[00:18:23.489 --> 00:18:32.837]  They began studying this effect in published trials, and decades later, we now have the fruit of this research.
[00:18:32.837 --> 00:18:41.464]  A fast-acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms.
[00:18:41.464 --> 00:18:47.089]  In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of tryptase.
[00:18:47.329 --> 00:18:52.277]  Which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.
[00:18:52.277 --> 00:18:54.921]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe.
[00:18:54.921 --> 00:18:59.648]  Head to Infowarslife.com and grab a pack of our Pollen Block chewable tablets.
[00:19:00.100 --> 00:19:10.687]  We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own four years of seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature to detoxify the body.
[00:19:10.687 --> 00:19:12.768]  That's why I'm introducing Z-SHIELD.
[00:19:12.768 --> 00:19:15.630]  Toxic Metal and Chemical Defense Support.
[00:19:15.630 --> 00:19:17.111]  It's made in the USA.
[00:19:17.111 --> 00:19:20.253]  It's filled with known compounds from nature that are
[00:19:20.493 --> 00:19:23.936]  Absolutely associated with detoxifying the body and it supports the info war.
[00:19:23.936 --> 00:19:26.017]  It is a classical 360 win.
[00:19:26.017 --> 00:19:35.725]  This is the formula that I personally have been taking for over a year and now we believe we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly get.
[00:19:35.725 --> 00:19:48.054]  You owe it to yourself, you owe it to your family, and you owe it to the future of this country and the world that patriots stay as healthy and as clean and as focused as you can be because we need you, the remnant of America,
[00:19:48.234 --> 00:19:52.518]  To reignite those brush fires to the next level and to be healthy and as focused as you can be.
[00:19:52.518 --> 00:19:55.821]  Thanks to your support and your prayers, together we're changing the world.
[00:19:55.821 --> 00:20:02.847]  Now it's time to change our bodies with Z-Shield and Infowarslive.com.
[00:20:02.847 --> 00:20:13.135]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:13.135 --> 00:20:14.437]  They think you're a goldfish!
[00:20:16.091 --> 00:20:18.453]  I've been betting on you my whole life!
[00:20:18.453 --> 00:20:19.954]  I believe in you!
[00:20:19.954 --> 00:20:23.737]  I don't think you're stupid!
[00:20:23.737 --> 00:20:26.059]  One man ever wrecks a woman!
[00:20:26.059 --> 00:20:27.920]  All genitals are cut off!
[00:20:27.920 --> 00:20:30.482]  And we're kicking these traitors' asses politically!
[00:20:30.482 --> 00:20:33.625]  And we're not backing down on her!
[00:20:33.625 --> 00:20:34.806]  I wanna kick these people!
[00:20:34.806 --> 00:20:35.366]  We're winning!
[00:20:35.366 --> 00:20:36.627]  I can feel the spirit rising!
[00:20:36.627 --> 00:20:37.088]  Can't you?
[00:20:37.088 --> 00:20:37.528]  We are!
[00:20:47.254 --> 00:20:51.040]  Now that's me getting very excited listening to Stranglehold a few months ago.
[00:20:51.040 --> 00:20:52.662]  Ted Nugent sarcastic.
[00:20:52.662 --> 00:20:54.104]  I can make a fool out of myself.
[00:20:54.104 --> 00:20:56.067]  But it's all fun, isn't it?
[00:20:56.067 --> 00:20:59.272]  Ted, we were talking during the break and I was asking your gut level...
[00:21:00.638 --> 00:21:05.823]  On what's going to happen tomorrow and what people need to do regardless.
[00:21:05.823 --> 00:21:14.211]  We have a dangerous, lawless, insane, attack dog, parasitic group of leftists in this country that literally want to conquer everybody.
[00:21:14.211 --> 00:21:16.473]  Like you were saying, they want to conquer Texas.
[00:21:16.473 --> 00:21:17.254]  They're obsessed with it.
[00:21:17.254 --> 00:21:18.815]  They want to steal the resources.
[00:21:18.815 --> 00:21:20.617]  They've already destroyed California.
[00:21:20.617 --> 00:21:22.799]  Now they're moving here like locusts.
[00:21:22.799 --> 00:21:23.420]  It's incredible.
[00:21:23.880 --> 00:21:28.732]  Oh, by the way, I should add, your new album is about to come out, which I heard some of the new tunes a few months ago at your house.
[00:21:28.732 --> 00:21:31.698]  It is absolutely a powerhouse.
[00:21:31.698 --> 00:21:32.881]  The music made me do it.
[00:21:32.881 --> 00:21:33.803]  Tell us about that first.
[00:21:34.560 --> 00:21:36.021]  Well, the music made me do it.
[00:21:36.021 --> 00:21:39.242]  I think that's a battle cry that we can all shout loud and proud.
[00:21:39.242 --> 00:21:40.883]  I mean, the music does make us do it.
[00:21:40.883 --> 00:21:45.525]  It's a great, great audio soundtrack to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
[00:21:45.525 --> 00:21:55.990]  And I've got the world's greatest driving, grinding, barbecuing band in the world, Greg Smith on bass, and Jason Hartman's this young whippersnapper from the Motor City on drums.
[00:21:55.990 --> 00:22:01.613]  And I just had the greatest tour of my life in 2018, which is truly a phenomenal statement, but it actually...
[00:22:02.633 --> 00:22:04.054]  Happens to be accurate.
[00:22:04.054 --> 00:22:06.815]  Just the intensity, the music, the band's never been tighter.
[00:22:06.815 --> 00:22:10.076]  We went to the studio and recorded a bunch of killer new songs.
[00:22:10.076 --> 00:22:12.337]  The name of the record is The Music Made Me Do It.
[00:22:12.337 --> 00:22:18.960]  This is like 60 years later and I'm having more fun than I did as a little whippersnapper in Detroit back in the 1950s and 60s.
[00:22:20.681 --> 00:22:30.355]  I witness a lot of that enthusiasm and passion, the same you have for getting the truth out that I have for making that Gibson guitar lay down the soundtrack.
[00:22:30.355 --> 00:22:36.424]  I get it from welders and mechanics and plumbers and electricians and farmers and ranchers and teachers and cops.
[00:22:37.004 --> 00:23:03.048]  All across this country, but I think the most important battle cry right now, going from my new record to the importance of this midterm election, Alex, and that is that if people in the asset column, working hard, playing hard, entrepreneurs, and just employed producers in America, if just, how about this, if just the licensed hunters in America,
[00:23:03.695 --> 00:23:21.197]  Would vote, conservative, Constitution, Bill of Rights, Golden Rule, if we could get rid of the self-inflicted embarrassment, the scourge of apathy and disconnect, if we could just get those that are in the asset column in this great country to vote.
[00:23:21.855 --> 00:23:28.197]  We would send the Liberals and the Democrats packing, because there are no blue states.
[00:23:28.197 --> 00:23:48.665]  There are red-blooded red states all across the nation, but if you look at California, you've got some high-crime, gun-free zones, sanctuary city, bankrupt, Liberal-Democrat hellholes where you have to dodge needles and feces to get to work in the morning.
[00:23:49.745 --> 00:23:51.906]  San Francisco is not California.
[00:23:51.906 --> 00:23:53.947]  Detroit is not Michigan.
[00:23:53.947 --> 00:23:56.269]  Chicago is not Illinois.
[00:23:56.269 --> 00:23:58.630]  Boston is not Massachusetts.
[00:23:58.630 --> 00:24:10.197]  But a lot of people in those otherwise known as blue states, they shrug their shoulders and they think they're overwhelmed by the blue curse in those states, and they don't vote.
[00:24:10.197 --> 00:24:14.359]  Alex, everybody listening right now to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:24:15.453 --> 00:24:20.669]  You know that we have to vote Republican, and I know Republicans have not been our friends often.
[00:24:21.405 --> 00:24:49.765]  But if we hold these Republican elected employees' feet to the constitutional fire, and we reach out today in preparation for the vote tomorrow, and get our family and friends and co-workers and hunting buddies and guys at the gun range and the barbecue and the bowling alley, we the people in the asset column that do perform our American responsibility to vote, we need to prod, cajole, inspire
[00:24:50.465 --> 00:24:59.250]  Beat, if necessary, everyone in our family to realize that if you vote Democrat, you're abandoning America.
[00:24:59.250 --> 00:25:05.134]  If you vote Democrat, you abandon America by eliminating secure borders.
[00:25:05.134 --> 00:25:06.674]  That's their policy.
[00:25:06.674 --> 00:25:13.759]  Democrats' policy is that you don't have to be an American to vote in America.
[00:25:13.759 --> 00:25:14.039]  Alex!
[00:25:14.932 --> 00:25:17.553]  This is sheer insanity!
[00:25:17.553 --> 00:25:21.434]  Well, that's how they're capturing us, as Matt Dredge pointed out in a tweet he put out.
[00:25:21.434 --> 00:25:35.440]  Mainstream news, even Politico had headlines, oh look, they're not citizens, but they're still getting the vote out, volunteering to canvas, volunteering to make phone calls, and it was illegal aliens actually involved in election meddling.
[00:25:35.440 --> 00:25:37.521]  That's mainstream news in our face.
[00:25:37.521 --> 00:25:41.042]  They have illegal aliens voting in San Francisco in local elections.
[00:25:41.042 --> 00:25:42.783]  So let me expand on this in our time.
[00:25:42.783 --> 00:25:43.403]  I'm not going to waste
[00:25:43.883 --> 00:25:44.824]  Time playing the clip.
[00:25:44.824 --> 00:25:45.525]  I'm sure you saw it.
[00:25:45.525 --> 00:25:47.167]  It's been big national news.
[00:25:47.167 --> 00:25:55.616]  Michael Moore's been making the rounds on late night TV saying, Working class white people like me from Michigan are stupid?
[00:25:56.400 --> 00:26:03.163]  We're dumb and we're the problem and we need to just die out as if white people are inherently bad.
[00:26:03.163 --> 00:26:13.689]  So because white people are associated with capitalism and free market and hard work, I guess in his mind, he says we're inherently bad and then throws Michigan particularly under the bus.
[00:26:14.389 --> 00:26:17.391]  Which is so horrible, all the white people, black people, you name it.
[00:26:17.391 --> 00:26:30.482]  When he first made his name, standing up against deindustrialization, and our jobs being shipped overseas, we finally get a president that proves he can bring them back, and who loves everybody, and this guy race baits and craps all over everyone.
[00:26:30.482 --> 00:26:31.623]  He is just a monster!
[00:26:32.657 --> 00:26:50.655]  Well, we have glowing and glaring and painful examples like Michael Moore, but here in the state of Michigan, again, I'm a Texan, I'm a proud Texan, and the battle between a great constitutionalist, a great dedicated employee of people like Ted Cruz, and this Beto O'Rourke
[00:26:51.215 --> 00:26:59.741]  Beto, or whatever it is, Beto O'Rourke that wants to turn Texas into California, and up here in Michigan, Michael Moore doesn't represent real Michigan.
[00:26:59.741 --> 00:27:06.325]  I've been campaigning with a great young black man from Detroit, this African-American, John James.
[00:27:06.325 --> 00:27:08.566]  I'd like Michael Moore to meet John James.
[00:27:08.566 --> 00:27:11.368]  This is a hero of the United States military.
[00:27:11.368 --> 00:27:13.189]  John James is running for U.S.
[00:27:13.189 --> 00:27:16.431]  Senate here in Michigan, and he is my blood brother.
[00:27:16.431 --> 00:27:18.573]  He represents working-hard America.
[00:27:19.921 --> 00:27:32.087]  In the asset column, without any color, without any race considerations at all, do you put your heart and soul into being a productive American like John James?
[00:27:32.087 --> 00:27:43.292]  Or are you an America-hating propagandist, racist, who identifies an entire color of race as bad guys like Michael Moore?
[00:27:43.292 --> 00:27:46.574]  I'm going to tell you, everybody I know, Alex, is
[00:27:46.974 --> 00:27:48.977]  I totally agree, by the way.
[00:28:01.872 --> 00:28:05.736]  All his movies fail, even the New York Times says everyone's sick of him.
[00:28:05.736 --> 00:28:10.402]  Michael Moore is worth hundreds of millions of dollars, but then he says free market's bad.
[00:28:10.402 --> 00:28:15.287]  He's a lying pig like the rest of the American-hating Democrats that don't want us to have jobs.
[00:28:15.287 --> 00:28:16.389]  They want to break our will.
[00:28:16.389 --> 00:28:18.411]  They want to totally take control of us.
[00:28:18.411 --> 00:28:22.496]  Every city, every area they take control of is a nightmare hellhole.
[00:28:23.096 --> 00:28:29.121]  Well, if I can just summarize it here in the state of Michigan, we're voting on whether to legalize recreational marijuana.
[00:28:29.121 --> 00:28:37.227]  And if you want more people to look and stink and sound like Michael Moore, then by all means, vote yes for recreational marijuana.
[00:28:37.227 --> 00:28:42.671]  Because this guy is the poster child for a brain-dead, America-hating punk.
[00:28:43.311 --> 00:28:44.613]  Well, you're on fire.
[00:28:44.613 --> 00:28:45.534]  TedNuja.com.
[00:28:45.534 --> 00:28:46.895]  The new album's about to come out.
[00:28:46.895 --> 00:28:48.096]  The music made me do it.
[00:28:48.096 --> 00:28:51.640]  I hope I'm talking to you in a couple days, my friend, and we've got a big victory.
[00:28:51.640 --> 00:28:54.062]  But regardless, America's awake again and rising.
[00:28:54.062 --> 00:28:55.604]  God bless you.
[00:28:55.604 --> 00:28:55.964]  Speed.
[00:28:55.964 --> 00:28:57.066]  God bless America, Alex.
[00:28:59.659 --> 00:29:01.820]  You've heard the phrase, you are what you eat?
[00:29:01.820 --> 00:29:02.601]  Not true.
[00:29:02.601 --> 00:29:04.462]  Actually you are what you can absorb.
[00:29:04.462 --> 00:29:08.444]  So if the vitamins and supplements you now take are not being absorbed, what good are they?
[00:29:08.444 --> 00:29:09.564]  Introducing Protovite.
[00:29:09.564 --> 00:29:15.908]  Proprietary liquid system that allows premium quality nutrients to positively affect the blood in an astonishing 5 minutes.
[00:29:15.908 --> 00:29:19.910]  Watch our amazing 2 minute live blood cell video at TrueHealthFacts.com.
[00:29:19.910 --> 00:29:21.791]  That's TrueHealthFacts.com.
[00:29:21.791 --> 00:29:22.311]  Then call 502-410-3411.
[00:29:22.311 --> 00:29:24.673]  Protovite is nutrition you can feel.
[00:29:24.673 --> 00:29:26.133]  Protovite is nutrition that gets in.
[00:29:29.403 --> 00:29:30.624]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.
[00:29:30.624 --> 00:29:34.545]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[00:29:34.545 --> 00:29:36.086]  I sued the IRS and won.
[00:29:36.086 --> 00:29:39.047]  I beat the IRS then, and I've been beating them ever since.
[00:29:39.047 --> 00:29:44.609]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement, and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved.
[00:29:44.609 --> 00:29:45.810]  I can help you, too.
[00:29:45.810 --> 00:29:48.751]  If you owe taxes you can't pay, don't wait another day.
[00:29:48.751 --> 00:29:50.972]  There's no such thing as a hopeless tax case.
[00:29:50.972 --> 00:29:55.414]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX or go to my website, danpilla.com.
[00:29:55.414 --> 00:29:57.715]  That's danpilla.com, danpilla.com.
[00:30:00.580 --> 00:30:06.608]  Our grandparents and great-grandparents knew they canned food during the fall, so they'd have it during the winter.
[00:30:06.608 --> 00:30:09.531]  And that's what I'm talking about at MFortWorthTour.com.

[00:31:00.234 --> 00:31:08.643]  It's really hard to have the energy at the end of the day to still get to the gym, or to go for a run, or go to the park, or heck, even take your dog for a walk.
[00:31:08.643 --> 00:31:10.105]  Believe me, I know.
[00:31:10.105 --> 00:31:14.810]  I spend hours in front of a screen and then hours in front of bright lights every day.
[00:31:14.810 --> 00:31:17.874]  But thanks to super male vitality at Infowarestore.com.

[00:31:20.034 --> 00:31:23.295]  There's no way I could have the energy at the end of a long day.
[00:31:23.295 --> 00:31:26.176]  To fight back against the chemicals in the food and water.
[00:31:26.176 --> 00:31:30.716]  To fight back against the modern day lifestyle with the screen time and the extended hours.
[00:31:30.716 --> 00:31:40.678]  To still have the stamina and endurance, energy and drive to get to the gym, get to the park, and get exercise that you need for your health.

[00:32:47.699 --> 00:32:49.120]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[00:33:13.960 --> 00:33:16.601]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:33:16.601 --> 00:33:28.247]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[00:33:28.247 --> 00:33:32.709]  Two choices.
[00:33:34.645 --> 00:33:38.808]  We are in an economic boom that most folks thought was impossible.
[00:33:38.808 --> 00:33:43.692]  We have penetrated the 1-2% so-called secular stagnation zone.
[00:33:43.692 --> 00:33:49.496]  Average hourly earnings up by 2.8% near record levels of consumer air business profits.
[00:33:50.997 --> 00:33:54.440]  The second quarter GDP growth is impressive.
[00:33:54.440 --> 00:33:59.444]  4.1%, the lowest unemployment rate since December of 1969.
[00:33:59.444 --> 00:34:03.547]  The American core economy is on fire.
[00:34:03.547 --> 00:34:05.328]  It's on fire like it was in the 60s.
[00:34:17.288 --> 00:34:18.669]  Or the Left's America.
[00:34:41.465 --> 00:34:45.228]  That's when civility can start again.
[00:34:45.228 --> 00:34:47.970]  Jobs, not mobs.
[00:34:47.970 --> 00:34:53.254]  Now, if you're a radio listener, you can hear the audio, but the video of that ad is extremely powerful.
[00:34:53.254 --> 00:35:07.465]  And I'd say I could tweet that out to everybody, but oh, they took myself and now over 50,000 Twitter accounts down under the orders of the Democrats in the last six months to meddle in the election.
[00:35:07.465 --> 00:35:10.027]  And now they've got illegal aliens in mainstream news.
[00:35:10.953 --> 00:35:13.054]  With the headlines like it's a good thing.
[00:35:13.054 --> 00:35:15.374]  They're not citizens.
[00:35:15.374 --> 00:35:17.135]  Many of them aren't even here legally.
[00:35:17.135 --> 00:35:22.057]  They can't vote, but they can canvass and make phone calls and donate money.
[00:35:22.057 --> 00:35:24.077]  No, you can't.
[00:35:24.077 --> 00:35:28.779]  But the Democrats yell and scream about election meddling, and they're the ones that have been doing it.
[00:35:28.779 --> 00:35:35.621]  Now, I could spend all day here with the technicals of why I think the Republicans hold on to the House and the Senate.
[00:35:35.621 --> 00:35:37.422]  There's a lot of information that goes into that.
[00:35:38.660 --> 00:35:45.764]  But I have trouble tracking the level of fraud, the level of illegal spending, the level of censorship.
[00:35:45.764 --> 00:35:50.107]  All I know is it's ultra massive.
[00:35:50.107 --> 00:36:00.433]  And it's political oppression, the likes of which this country has never seen on this scale.
[00:36:00.433 --> 00:36:05.095]  And so I don't know if we're going to win tomorrow or not.
[00:36:05.095 --> 00:36:06.076]  I knew we were going to win.
[00:36:07.811 --> 00:36:17.957]  Two years ago because they were oversampling on some CNN polls 36% extra against Trump?
[00:36:17.957 --> 00:36:23.320]  And they have Hillary at 75% winning and I'd do the math and explain that's really her losing?
[00:36:26.485 --> 00:36:36.693]  This time, the Democrats are five points ahead in most of these phony polls, and in some polls, the Republicans are ahead a point or two.
[00:36:36.693 --> 00:36:43.039]  Like Rasmussen today, it's on Infowars.com, Paul Watson article, it's a big deal.
[00:36:43.039 --> 00:36:50.065]  And I go look at the methodology, they're running the same scams they ran two years ago.
[00:36:50.065 --> 00:36:52.687]  So, are they just counting on electronic voting machine fraud?
[00:36:52.687 --> 00:36:55.149]  We know Soros owns, has a share in.
[00:36:57.173 --> 00:37:00.335]  More than half the companies?
[00:37:00.335 --> 00:37:00.695]  I don't know.
[00:37:00.695 --> 00:37:07.059]  Remember the New York Times had her on their front page for months at 98 percent, 97 percent.
[00:37:07.059 --> 00:37:10.481]  About a week before, 60 percent, you know, 80 percent.
[00:37:10.481 --> 00:37:12.262]  It went back and forth.
[00:37:12.262 --> 00:37:15.023]  Because they began to figure out their bull wasn't working.
[00:37:15.023 --> 00:37:18.245]  All I'm telling you is, I've never seen so much activity.
[00:37:18.245 --> 00:37:19.986]  I've never seen so much bullying.
[00:37:19.986 --> 00:37:21.787]  I've never seen so much censorship.
[00:37:21.787 --> 00:37:24.029]  I've never seen so much foaming at the mouth.
[00:37:24.029 --> 00:37:24.589]  So I don't know.
[00:37:26.854 --> 00:37:30.156]  But I want to be clear about something.
[00:37:30.156 --> 00:37:33.077]  I want to be totally crystal clear about something.
[00:37:33.077 --> 00:37:34.558]  There are two different roads here.
[00:37:34.558 --> 00:37:40.860]  And I'm going to talk about this in the next segment.
[00:37:40.860 --> 00:37:46.223]  But what I'm going to tell you on air is the reason they want me off air.
[00:37:46.223 --> 00:37:53.006]  Because InfoWars is visionary, I do my homework, and I know what I'm talking about.
[00:37:54.338 --> 00:37:59.102]  And we could lose the country if we win this election.
[00:37:59.102 --> 00:38:07.368]  It hit me yesterday because I've been thinking and focusing and frustrated trying to come up with what the answer is I was looking for.
[00:38:07.368 --> 00:38:20.559]  Why I was frustrated because my subconscious is hundreds of times more powerful than my conscience and it was not happy and as soon as this came into vision and I researched it at a cognitive level, I knew I was right.
[00:38:23.971 --> 00:38:26.552]  Because election numbers are surging on both sides.
[00:38:26.552 --> 00:38:28.172]  Turnout is surging on both sides.
[00:38:28.172 --> 00:38:32.713]  But what's really important here?
[00:38:32.713 --> 00:38:43.116]  If we win this midterm and people go to sleep, we could lose the election in two years.
[00:38:43.116 --> 00:38:46.117]  And if the Republicans don't go after the Democrats for the
[00:38:47.316 --> 00:39:12.510]  Soviet level censorship of conservatives and Christians and the deplatforming and taking the bank accounts and all the rest of it, then it will cement that and they will get worse and so we will have an occupied government and a tyranny and a divided nation with Trump trying to fix the economy and put out fires while the emboldened Democrats ratchet up their crime.
[00:39:12.510 --> 00:39:16.812]  So I want to win tomorrow.
[00:39:19.019 --> 00:39:31.721]  But I want people to stay awake and realize that's only the next level of our invasion of the United States, our take back of the Republic from the globalists and the reinforcements they're trying to pour in.
[00:39:31.721 --> 00:39:33.662]  This is 21st century warfare, folks.
[00:39:33.662 --> 00:39:37.642]  This is real toe-to-toe battle with the globalists.
[00:39:37.642 --> 00:39:41.643]  Outside powerful combines trying to destabilize and overthrow the nation.
[00:39:41.643 --> 00:39:45.164]  This is very serious business.
[00:39:45.164 --> 00:39:47.604]  So if we beat the Democrats, we shouldn't be celebrating.
[00:39:49.448 --> 00:39:56.012]  We should be realizing we just won one more big battle and God's on our side, but it's about to get even tougher.
[00:39:56.012 --> 00:40:05.218]  And if we lose, it's going to get even tougher, but maybe we'll know we're getting our asses kicked again and we'll do something about it.
[00:40:05.218 --> 00:40:11.162]  Now, I haven't aired this since election day, a year and 364 days ago, but I'm going to air
[00:40:17.506 --> 00:40:31.352]  The entire 15 minute compilation that our great Rob Dew put together, our news director, of my predictions on election night and what I said once Trump was officially admitted to have won.
[00:40:31.352 --> 00:40:37.755]  And Hillary wouldn't show up and concede and we told you she was having an alcoholic flip out and eating the carpet, which was later confirmed.
[00:40:37.755 --> 00:40:43.577]  See, we have good sources.
[00:40:43.577 --> 00:40:46.039]  Secret Service doesn't tell me anything now because there's no need to.
[00:40:46.039 --> 00:40:46.679]  Trump's not a traitor.
[00:40:48.607 --> 00:40:51.808]  Sure, if he becomes one, they'll tell me, which is not going to happen.
[00:40:51.808 --> 00:40:54.769]  Don't ever hold your breath for that to happen.
[00:40:54.769 --> 00:40:57.590]  Trump is so pig-headed, it's the best thing ever for this country.
[00:40:57.590 --> 00:40:59.110]  He's the perfect person for this.
[00:40:59.110 --> 00:41:02.931]  And let me tell you something, it isn't about groveling at Trump's feet or being sycophantic.
[00:41:02.931 --> 00:41:10.313]  It's about thanking God we've got somebody that's willing to stand up against the lies, the tyranny, the oppression, and turn things around.
[00:41:10.313 --> 00:41:14.254]  But there's a path to victory if we lose tomorrow.
[00:41:14.254 --> 00:41:16.315]  There's a path to victory if we win tomorrow.
[00:41:17.244 --> 00:41:23.429]  There's a path to fail if we win tomorrow, and there is a path to fail if we lose tomorrow.
[00:41:23.429 --> 00:41:30.915]  And that's what we better be thinking about is grand strategy, grand aim, what our goal is, where we're going, not just this battle.
[00:41:30.915 --> 00:41:32.476]  Grand strategy is key.
[00:41:32.476 --> 00:41:37.440]  They always want to keep you down in the mud looking at the latest little problem.
[00:41:37.440 --> 00:41:38.200]  Those are important.
[00:41:38.200 --> 00:41:39.461]  Look at them, take care of them.
[00:41:39.461 --> 00:41:41.243]  But look at where they're coming from.
[00:41:41.243 --> 00:41:42.724]  Look at who the enemy is.
[00:41:42.724 --> 00:41:44.325]  Look at how the enemy ticks.
[00:41:44.325 --> 00:41:45.426]  Look at how we're going to defeat them.
[00:41:47.040 --> 00:42:01.606]  And the best way to defeat them is to point out that they're a bunch of offshore mega-globalists, tax-exempt, above the law, who've committed more crimes than anybody can ever imagine, who are totally ruthless, and everyone is insane if we put up with it.
[00:42:01.606 --> 00:42:07.288]  Now, we had one of the biggest sales, if not biggest sales in our history, because they're trying to take our payment processors and shut us down.
[00:42:07.288 --> 00:42:08.408]  They haven't been able to do that yet.
[00:42:08.408 --> 00:42:09.329]  They took five of the six.
[00:42:10.376 --> 00:42:14.899]  I got a backup, but we're still, you know, redlining here.
[00:42:14.899 --> 00:42:28.410]  And so I want you to sell out a lot of the products that we had that had been developed and packaged and prepared for the Christmas sale, the Black Friday sale, and more.
[00:42:28.410 --> 00:42:29.751]  It was a very successful sale.
[00:42:29.751 --> 00:42:32.913]  We sold out a lot of things or came very, very close to it.
[00:42:32.913 --> 00:42:38.878]  But the items we do have, I'm now going to offer an even bigger discount, but it's only going to run through
[00:42:40.436 --> 00:42:48.539]  Next week, and ladies and gentlemen, that's the InfoWars 67% off blowout sale.
[00:42:48.539 --> 00:42:50.219]  Most of these are lost leaders.
[00:42:50.219 --> 00:42:57.502]  Silver Bullets, Super Mill Vitality, Brain Force, Survival Shield X3, Alexa Pure Water Filtration Systems, they all are between 67...
[00:42:59.226 --> 00:43:08.538]  The globalists know that if they suppress the good halogen and pump the environment full of the bad halogens, fluoride, chlorine, bromine, you name it, that it lowers IQ.
[00:43:08.538 --> 00:43:11.402]  It literally dumbs the population down.
[00:43:11.402 --> 00:43:17.449]  And on our quest to bring our listeners and viewers the best iodine out of the world, we've gone through two permutations.
[00:43:18.110 --> 00:43:24.374]  First, seaweed-based iodine that was pretty good but hard to source, and the Globels tried to block us getting a supply of it.
[00:43:24.374 --> 00:43:30.659]  So we discovered deep-earth crystals of pure nascent iodine and brought you X2 that's been incredible.
[00:43:30.659 --> 00:43:37.683]  Now, due to the Establishment trying to block that, we did more research and secured more of the deep-earth crystals of nascent iodine.
[00:43:37.683 --> 00:43:37.904]  But!
[00:43:38.744 --> 00:43:51.749]  Chemists, scientists, and others showed us the research that by combining it with three other compounds, two forms of iodine and vitamin C, it supercharges it and makes it even more bioavailable.
[00:43:51.749 --> 00:43:56.011]  Ladies and gentlemen, if you want to research it, you want to see it, it's an incredible discovery.
[00:43:56.011 --> 00:43:58.712]  X3, now available at mploreslife.com.
[00:43:59.392 --> 00:44:03.634]  Please, whatever you do, realize that we're all getting punched drunk to the censorship.
[00:44:03.634 --> 00:44:07.115]  And you saw 18 Twitter accounts, they say, affiliated with InfoWars.
[00:44:07.115 --> 00:44:08.875]  Yeah, some of them are like little side accounts.
[00:44:08.875 --> 00:44:12.137]  They know we had like InfoWars stores that just showed our products.
[00:44:12.137 --> 00:44:18.919]  But they just banned them all yesterday in punishment that I be at a Trump rally and be mobbed by all these folks that loved us.
[00:44:18.919 --> 00:44:24.001]  Your excitement about America, your excitement about this broadcast is what brought the country and the world back from the brick.
[00:44:24.341 --> 00:44:30.443]  But the globalists now want to target where the resistance came from, so that we're not pesky in the future.
[00:44:30.443 --> 00:44:33.445]  I want to be troublesome and pesky.
[00:44:33.445 --> 00:44:34.525]  I want to keep going.
[00:44:34.525 --> 00:44:38.367]  I want to make them do the ultimate, not just destroy us financially.
[00:44:38.367 --> 00:44:40.367]  I want to push all the way.
[00:44:40.367 --> 00:44:41.668]  I've committed to do that.
[00:44:41.668 --> 00:44:42.748]  I've prayed for that.
[00:44:42.748 --> 00:44:44.389]  And I've been told that's going to happen.
[00:44:44.389 --> 00:44:46.830]  But you've got to back us, and I promise you this.
[00:44:47.330 --> 00:44:48.633]  I will never falter.
[00:44:48.633 --> 00:44:50.977]  I will never waver at the spiritual level.
[00:44:50.977 --> 00:44:51.919]  I physically will.

[00:46:01.502 --> 00:46:07.166]  We need to go back and revisit the foundations of our freedom.
[00:46:07.166 --> 00:46:10.288]  Our freedoms don't consist of the things that are enumerated on a piece of paper.
[00:46:10.288 --> 00:46:12.970]  It consists of the things that we're willing to fight for.
[00:46:12.970 --> 00:46:17.253]  The First Amendment, the Bill of Rights, the rest of the Bill of Rights are prohibitions.
[00:46:17.253 --> 00:46:24.758]  They're prohibitions against powerful organizations and individuals taking those God-given rights from us as individuals.
[00:46:24.758 --> 00:46:27.060]  You better understand that, because they're taking them right now.
[00:46:30.609 --> 00:46:32.831]  We have seen what they want to do.
[00:46:32.831 --> 00:46:35.853]  They called it UN Agenda 21, now they call it the UN 2030 Agenda.
[00:46:35.853 --> 00:46:47.780]  They want everybody off of the rural lands, they want people out of the suburbs, they want to pack everybody into the cities, because that's where it is easiest for them to control everyone.
[00:46:47.780 --> 00:46:50.142]  It's the David Knight Show!
[00:46:50.142 --> 00:46:52.483]  Never miss your show, any day.
[00:46:52.483 --> 00:46:54.325]  I mean, what?
[00:46:54.325 --> 00:46:55.245]  I mean, never!
[00:47:03.278 --> 00:47:05.886]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:24.836 --> 00:47:29.680]  Rallying patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty.
[00:47:29.680 --> 00:47:33.884]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:33.884 --> 00:47:38.808]  In less than 20 hours, polls will begin opening on the East Coast.
[00:47:38.808 --> 00:47:44.212]  In about 20 hours, they'll open in the middle of the country, Central Time.
[00:47:44.212 --> 00:47:47.054]  Then Mountain, then Pacific.
[00:47:47.054 --> 00:47:47.475]  And by
[00:47:49.568 --> 00:47:55.010]  Midnight tomorrow night, we'll have a very good chance about who's holding the House and Senate.
[00:47:55.010 --> 00:48:03.113]  Except some of these races are so close, there's a couple of run-offs coming up in a few months that may actually decide it.
[00:48:03.113 --> 00:48:11.217]  This is going to be hard fought, and that's my big message that I'm going to be launching with Roger Stone in studio next hour.
[00:48:11.217 --> 00:48:16.819]  Is even if we win, it was by overcoming massive fraud, and we must
[00:48:18.044 --> 00:48:19.305]  Demand recounts.
[00:48:19.305 --> 00:48:31.453]  We must demand investigations of election meddling by Beto O'Rourke and all the Soros money he got and the foreign money he got and aiding the caravan.
[00:48:31.453 --> 00:48:42.621]  And we must expose the big tech censorship that by blocking Republicans and others being able to advertise on Facebook but letting Democrats advertise is a total Federal Elections Commission violation.
[00:48:44.246 --> 00:49:01.718]  And thank God we've got Trump, because they're signaling in the news today, and this is coming up as well, antitrust investigations, that is in CNBC, against Big Tech, Amazon, and others, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:49:01.718 --> 00:49:05.241]  So this is one hell of a fight we're in.
[00:49:05.241 --> 00:49:07.483]  It's our moral duty, it's our responsibility,
[00:49:08.362 --> 00:49:16.827]  To have hearings about election meddling by the Chi-Coms, funding Hollywood, funding four-page ads, full-page ads, radio ads, TV ads.
[00:49:16.827 --> 00:49:19.809]  They're doing it publicly!
[00:49:19.809 --> 00:49:22.310]  We have them!
[00:49:22.310 --> 00:49:25.492]  They've gone so far, it's just incredible.
[00:49:25.492 --> 00:49:30.135]  And then, next hour with Roger Stone, I'm going to talk about
[00:49:31.260 --> 00:49:38.703]  Some of these other articles I have, dim candidate Georgians might have to turn their guns in, close quote.
[00:49:38.703 --> 00:49:45.565]  That's a Kent Daniels, newswars.com, infowars.com article.
[00:49:45.565 --> 00:49:58.070]  Also, even mainstream media is now reporting that hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of quote, former CIA people all ran in the midterms against Republicans.
[00:49:59.090 --> 00:50:06.936]  That they all had in state and federal elections bizarre homeland security support and bizarre foundation support.
[00:50:06.936 --> 00:50:20.286]  Because the country is in a civil war against loyal Americans and globalist collaborators who are actively working to destroy this country and capture it.
[00:50:20.286 --> 00:50:21.947]  They see us as weak.
[00:50:21.947 --> 00:50:23.388]  They see themselves as a cartel.
[00:50:24.480 --> 00:50:36.432]  And they have made the decision to end free market, to end America, to end the Republic, and to basically become the new political party, the inner party, like they have in Communist China.
[00:50:36.432 --> 00:50:46.181]  Not of the Democrats, but of the deep state, of the bureaucracy, and set up a permanent bureaucratic dictatorship in this country.
[00:50:46.181 --> 00:50:48.623]  Of course, you all know it as the swamp.
[00:50:49.477 --> 00:50:52.982]  Mike Adams has written an extremely critical article that must go viral.
[00:50:52.982 --> 00:51:02.817]  I'm not sure the headline is strong enough, but win or lose, it's time for America to push back against the incivility, lawlessness, and fraud of the political left.
[00:51:02.817 --> 00:51:03.659]  Very strong headline.
[00:51:04.804 --> 00:51:11.189]  But really what we're talking about is, win or lose, Democrats aren't Americans.
[00:51:11.189 --> 00:51:20.636]  Democrats are an anti-American party working with foreign multinational interests and must be met head-on and smoked out of their holes politically.
[00:51:20.636 --> 00:51:31.424]  They've got to be sued, they've got to be indicted, they've got to be, and believe me, you know, I know who gave us the shutdown of our banking and our
[00:51:33.576 --> 00:51:35.238]  Operations.
[00:51:35.238 --> 00:51:36.679]  And the lawyers have looked at it.
[00:51:36.679 --> 00:51:48.450]  It's open and shut criminal activity by a large financial institution that controls not the credit score for the average person, but a secret credit scoring for companies.
[00:51:48.450 --> 00:51:51.212]  And we had perfect score.
[00:51:51.212 --> 00:51:52.674]  No one, almost no one has it.
[00:51:52.674 --> 00:51:53.274]  We had a 99.999.
[00:51:53.274 --> 00:51:58.099]  I'm going to be announcing this soon and I'm going to sue them.
[00:51:58.099 --> 00:51:59.140]  So I'm just giving them a heads up.
[00:52:01.738 --> 00:52:09.811]  And they decided to put in there the designation of hate, something that wasn't even in their system before, and then that gives us a zero.
[00:52:10.998 --> 00:52:11.839]  That's right.
[00:52:11.839 --> 00:52:25.248]  Infowars has zero credit because a criminal group in the deep state associated with intelligence agencies treated me like a foreign government and put sanctions on us saying, do not do business with us.
[00:52:25.248 --> 00:52:28.750]  I think the president's going to be very interested in this.
[00:52:28.750 --> 00:52:31.492]  Congress is going to be very interested in this.
[00:52:31.492 --> 00:52:35.255]  And you're going to pay.
[00:52:35.255 --> 00:52:35.935]  You're going to pay.
[00:52:35.935 --> 00:52:38.077]  Oh, I forgot the best part.
[00:52:40.233 --> 00:52:43.614]  We have moles inside these groups, that's why we know this.
[00:52:43.614 --> 00:52:54.638]  They're really freaked out because they're saying, oh yes, next we're going to roll it out against the NRA, and against conservatives in general, and against Christians, and against anybody who's pro-America.
[00:52:54.638 --> 00:52:57.720]  You won't be able to get a bank account.
[00:52:57.720 --> 00:52:59.320]  And they're going to do it!
[00:52:59.320 --> 00:53:05.322]  They think they're just going to roll this out and literally put you on the street.
[00:53:05.322 --> 00:53:06.463]  That's called dictatorship.
[00:53:07.478 --> 00:53:14.342]  And all because they define you as hate, they put it into this system that only the banks and financial systems see.
[00:53:14.342 --> 00:53:33.172]  I'll be announcing it all soon, but we have to have documentaries and films, we have to have ads, we have to have lawsuits with it showing it all, because we have to really get this all ready for Congress and the President and everybody to take strong, decisive action, because this is seriously criminal.
[00:53:33.172 --> 00:53:34.153]  Seriously criminal.
[00:53:35.182 --> 00:53:42.344]  Now there's been some big judgments for companies and groups that claim that companies and things don't have value that they don't, just to be mean.
[00:53:42.344 --> 00:53:46.525]  That's called espionage.
[00:53:46.525 --> 00:53:49.846]  And so, this is so wide-reaching.
[00:53:49.846 --> 00:53:56.048]  It's the Chinese social score in one fell swoop.
[00:53:56.048 --> 00:54:02.490]  In one fell swoop, they intend to cut off conservatives, Christians, libertarians, veterans, you name it.
[00:54:03.988 --> 00:54:10.433]  And they've even got a plan to then drive you into the hands of another group, but then they're gonna rip you off and charge you extra money.
[00:54:10.433 --> 00:54:17.399]  So they've got a whole plan ready, and the whole plan's gonna come down, and I expect people will probably go to jail after this.
[00:54:17.399 --> 00:54:27.367]  But again, these criminals have been getting along, you know, getting away with this for so long, they think that they are invincible.
[00:54:27.367 --> 00:54:30.189]  They think that they are unstoppable.
[00:54:31.772 --> 00:54:33.592]  They think that they're God.
[00:54:33.592 --> 00:54:40.994]  They think they're going to go on forever, and ever, and ever.
[00:54:40.994 --> 00:54:45.035]  And that is just not the case, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:54:45.035 --> 00:54:47.096]  So, this is what criminals always do.
[00:54:47.096 --> 00:54:56.398]  They push, and they push, and they push, and they push, and they push, and they push, and they get away with it, and they get away with it, and they get away with it, and they get away with it, and finally,
[00:54:58.502 --> 00:55:04.383]  They can't believe that the people turn against them and don't care what they say, or don't care what they do, or don't care how much intimidation there is.
[00:55:04.383 --> 00:55:06.944]  They stand against them.
[00:55:06.944 --> 00:55:13.765]  So coming up, I'm going to play about 10 minutes or so of election night two years ago, where I said, get ready for the big assault.
[00:55:13.765 --> 00:55:14.805]  Get ready for lawlessness.
[00:55:14.805 --> 00:55:18.966]  And Roger Stone is going to be joining us in studio.
[00:55:18.966 --> 00:55:20.546]  And we've got a bunch of other big guests.
[00:55:20.546 --> 00:55:23.067]  We're going to be broadcasting until midnight tonight.
[00:55:24.735 --> 00:55:26.617]  And then tomorrow with David Knight at 8 a.m.
[00:55:26.617 --> 00:55:40.211]  we kick off with live InfoWars coverage of the midterm elections and then we go right through Tuesday into the early morning hours as late as we have to go into Wednesday.
[00:55:41.221 --> 00:55:42.963]  And, you know, we always do this for other elections.
[00:55:42.963 --> 00:55:45.265]  This one's so important, I overlooked it.
[00:55:45.265 --> 00:55:47.747]  But I guess today, we'll just make an election page.
[00:55:47.747 --> 00:55:51.190]  We already have Infowars.com forward slash show.
[00:55:51.190 --> 00:55:56.314]  We already have the daily article we put out at Infowars.com and Newswars.com.
[00:55:56.314 --> 00:56:01.358]  And we can pull that up that, you know, says one day left to countdown to historic election.
[00:56:01.358 --> 00:56:04.141]  And that's got the live audio and live video feeds in it.
[00:56:04.141 --> 00:56:07.284]  But regardless, just let your friends, your neighbors, your family,
[00:56:07.884 --> 00:56:23.787]  Your community know that they can go to Infowars.com and get the censored coverage of what's really going on and then find out about fighting back against all of this.
[00:56:23.787 --> 00:56:32.189]  Regardless of whether we win or lose, we've got to go after them for what they've done.
[00:56:32.189 --> 00:56:37.370]  So now, because I didn't do a very good plug last segment before we start the next hour, I'm going to
[00:56:38.513 --> 00:56:41.235]  I'm going to do it now, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:56:41.235 --> 00:56:46.539]  We have the biggest sale in our history on limited items.
[00:56:46.539 --> 00:56:51.823]  It does not top the biggest sale we've ever engaged in, period.
[00:56:51.823 --> 00:56:56.866]  And I've lost my piece of paper because I'm just losing everything here, let me tell you.
[00:56:56.866 --> 00:56:58.988]  But there it is at infowarestore.com.
[00:56:58.988 --> 00:57:01.690]  67% out total blowout sale.
[00:57:06.356 --> 00:57:08.611]  On the highest quality colloidal silver out there.
[00:57:09.650 --> 00:57:12.451]  They sell it for $29 at Whole Foods with another label on it.
[00:57:12.451 --> 00:57:14.352]  We normally sell it for $19.95.
[00:57:14.352 --> 00:57:16.813]  It's 67% off right now.
[00:57:16.813 --> 00:57:20.135]  We also have Super Melon, Super Female Vitality, the final run of that.
[00:57:20.135 --> 00:57:25.838]  Even though it would take me a long time to sell out of it, we've got it at 57% off because I just want to move it out.
[00:57:25.838 --> 00:57:31.801]  50% off on Brain Force Plus, a big discount on Alexa Pure, water filtration, and so much more.
[00:57:31.801 --> 00:57:36.263]  And your purchases all make the broadcast and what we do here possible.
[00:57:37.083 --> 00:57:43.566]  So again, Infowarsstore.com, Infowarslife.com, or 888-253-3139.
[00:57:43.566 --> 00:57:49.368]  Next hour, only two minutes away.

[00:59:07.841 --> 00:59:08.141]  I think so.
[00:59:25.520 --> 00:59:26.000]  I think so.
[00:59:53.318 --> 00:59:55.954]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:23.601 --> 01:00:29.743]  Well, it's November 5th, 2000 at 18, and I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[01:00:29.743 --> 01:00:36.926]  We are less than 20 hours out from the polls opening tomorrow on the East Coast.
[01:00:36.926 --> 01:00:42.388]  And we're going to have live coverage right through to the middle of the night.
[01:00:42.388 --> 01:00:51.572]  There's a good chance we won't know who the winners are until one or two in the morning, and it could even go longer than that because there are reports coming in
[01:00:54.480 --> 01:01:17.437]  We're going to be looking at here coming up that there are some runoff elections coming up that if the margin is basically a dead heat, then it may be a few months with these runoff elections coming until we find out exactly who the winner is going to be.
[01:01:17.437 --> 01:01:21.020]  But I'll tell you this.
[01:01:21.020 --> 01:01:22.161]  We've come from nowhere.
[01:01:24.136 --> 01:01:27.859]  Exposing the entire globalist system.
[01:01:27.859 --> 01:01:35.425]  And people would talk about the New World Order 30 years ago, 20 years ago, and people looked at it like you were a space alien.
[01:01:35.425 --> 01:01:41.530]  This corporate media had preconditioned everybody that it didn't exist.
[01:01:41.530 --> 01:01:52.599]  But now that people understand that this is all real, and world government's real, and that it's unelected, you've got prominent people all over the planet saying, this is wrong.
[01:01:57.881 --> 01:02:02.843]  And so I know I keep going back to that same point.
[01:02:02.843 --> 01:02:05.263]  You know what I hate about this show is looking at myself.
[01:02:05.263 --> 01:02:06.684]  I can't do it anymore.
[01:02:06.684 --> 01:02:08.944]  I'm gonna have to go off air.
[01:02:08.944 --> 01:02:10.525]  It's me.
[01:02:10.525 --> 01:02:12.065]  I cannot look at myself.
[01:02:12.065 --> 01:02:12.506]  I hate it.
[01:02:12.506 --> 01:02:13.906]  I'm not a narcissist.
[01:02:13.906 --> 01:02:20.608]  And it's just I used to love radio because I could sit there and really think and go over and get in my thought process.
[01:02:20.608 --> 01:02:24.889]  And I wonder why do I am so happy and then I get here and I'm so upset every day.
[01:02:24.889 --> 01:02:25.910]  I'm just so upset.
[01:02:26.840 --> 01:02:29.503]  That's because I'm just looking at myself and all these cameras.
[01:02:29.503 --> 01:02:44.157]  We've got to figure out a way to like just put articles up most of the time or video up of something else because I'm having to direct my own show and I'm looking at myself in here and it's just driving me wild in a bad way.
[01:02:44.157 --> 01:02:45.719]  And it's just not tenable.
[01:02:45.719 --> 01:02:47.280]  I'm going to have to change the way the show works.
[01:02:48.220 --> 01:02:50.961]  Because I don't like looking at myself before.
[01:02:50.961 --> 01:02:52.001]  I really don't, now.
[01:02:52.001 --> 01:02:53.061]  You know what I mean?
[01:02:53.061 --> 01:02:58.283]  And then I gotta look at Hillary, and I gotta look at Michael Moore while I'm in here, and they gotta be beaten.
[01:02:58.283 --> 01:02:59.303]  They've gotta be stopped.
[01:02:59.303 --> 01:03:03.104]  But, at the same time... Woo!
[01:03:03.104 --> 01:03:04.424]  Katie bar the door!
[01:03:04.424 --> 01:03:07.065]  Just, you know, Calgon, take me away, man!
[01:03:07.065 --> 01:03:07.885]  Good God!
[01:03:07.885 --> 01:03:11.526]  I mean, there's just so... Here it is.
[01:03:16.673 --> 01:03:20.856]  It's the frustration that this should all just be so easy.
[01:03:20.856 --> 01:03:24.038]  We shouldn't let unelected... Yeah, let's look at him for now.
[01:03:24.038 --> 01:03:34.724]  That we shouldn't let unelected megabanks run our lives and create all this division and control us.
[01:03:34.724 --> 01:03:44.531]  And then it's so obvious that they've created these universities, these America-hating institutions to breed and create these giant nests of total morons
[01:03:46.741 --> 01:03:56.848]  And then now we've got a large portion of the population that's been turned into these spoiled, rotten leftist authoritarians.
[01:03:56.848 --> 01:04:02.132]  And they believed Hillary was supposed to be when they took over and finally got all their free goodies.
[01:04:02.132 --> 01:04:03.312]  And that didn't happen.
[01:04:03.312 --> 01:04:05.574]  So they're now on a giant conniption fit.
[01:04:09.218 --> 01:04:12.700]  Trying to stop the recovery because they don't want a recovery.
[01:04:12.700 --> 01:04:25.909]  They want to control every aspect of our lives and run us in the ground so they can dictate societal controls on us because that's what these control freaks crave more than anything on the planet.
[01:04:25.909 --> 01:04:26.609]  I kind of liked it.
[01:04:26.609 --> 01:04:28.970]  That's the new host of the show.
[01:04:28.970 --> 01:04:30.431]  He doesn't mind cameras being on him.
[01:04:30.431 --> 01:04:32.152]  He doesn't see anything.
[01:04:32.152 --> 01:04:34.954]  That's the new system.
[01:04:34.954 --> 01:04:35.495]  I'm serious.
[01:04:36.465 --> 01:04:42.772]  Large portions of the show will now be a Spartan bronze figure.
[01:04:42.772 --> 01:04:43.172]  That's it.
[01:04:43.172 --> 01:04:44.794]  We're going back to radio.
[01:04:44.794 --> 01:04:47.557]  I launched all this to dominate YouTube and stuff, but my God.
[01:04:47.557 --> 01:04:51.280]  There's only so much of my ugly fat face I can look at.
[01:04:51.280 --> 01:04:53.683]  It's election day, ladies and gentlemen, in 20 hours.
[01:04:53.683 --> 01:04:54.163]  Stay with us.
[01:04:58.444 --> 01:05:00.807]  We all know the importance of fish oils.
[01:05:00.807 --> 01:05:07.395]  While we are sure to provide them for ourselves, it's just as important to make sure your kids get their EPA and DHA too.
[01:05:07.395 --> 01:05:14.785]  Honor Roll is a powerful DHA fish oil formula for your child, built from the ground up to support your child's development.
[01:05:15.205 --> 01:05:24.855]  This formula uses wild anchovy fish oil, ultra-purified krill oil, and wild salmon fish oil with vitamins to boost your child's mind and body.
[01:05:24.855 --> 01:05:32.023]  With this fish oil formula, you can support your child's optimal heart, joint, cognitive, and brain health while providing DHA.
[01:05:33.004 --> 01:05:36.848]  Which has been shown to be essential for your child's brain growth spurts.
[01:05:36.848 --> 01:05:46.677]  Built on powerful ingredients with 580 milligrams of high DHA omega-3s, this formula is highly refined to eliminate nearly all heavy metals.
[01:05:46.677 --> 01:05:51.021]  If you're looking for a formula to help your child grow, look no further.
[01:05:51.021 --> 01:05:55.205]  Try Honor Roll from InfoWars Life at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:06:02.859 --> 01:06:09.427]  You are listening to an InfoWars.com Frontline Report.
[01:06:09.427 --> 01:06:13.352]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the Resistance.
[01:06:20.945 --> 01:06:30.808]  From deep in the heart of FEMA Region 6, Austin, Texas, transmitting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[01:06:30.808 --> 01:06:42.972]  We're 20 hours out, and President Trump says as soon as the midterms are over, whether they retain the House and Senate or not, he's looking very strongly at antitrust action against Amazon and Big Tech.
[01:06:42.972 --> 01:06:44.753]  Here he is being interviewed by Axios.
[01:06:45.785 --> 01:06:47.806]  Talk about what's been happening on social media.
[01:06:47.806 --> 01:06:52.128]  A lot of people questioning whether or not these companies are getting too big, too fast.
[01:06:52.128 --> 01:06:53.689]  Your Facebooks, your Amazons.
[01:06:53.689 --> 01:06:59.292]  Have you put thought into how Amazon and Facebook specifically should be regulated?
[01:06:59.292 --> 01:07:05.955]  You look at the European Union, they find, I guess it was Google, billions of dollars.
[01:07:05.955 --> 01:07:09.857]  And frankly, I don't like that they're doing that because that's an American company.
[01:07:09.857 --> 01:07:11.658]  I don't think it's good that they're doing that.
[01:07:11.658 --> 01:07:13.999]  But if anybody does that, that should be us doing it.
[01:07:14.699 --> 01:07:16.582]  That shouldn't be the European Union.
[01:07:16.582 --> 01:07:18.204]  Do you think he'll regulate in the first term?
[01:07:18.204 --> 01:07:23.811]  You know, you get into the whole thing with freedom of speech and what do you think and... But what about monopoly?
[01:07:23.811 --> 01:07:31.260]  What about saying the Justice Department... Well, you do, you know, I have so many people saying that, but it's certainly something that we have looked at... Would you ever break them up?
[01:07:32.081 --> 01:07:33.502]  They were talking about this years ago.
[01:07:33.502 --> 01:07:40.405]  You know, they were actually talking about this same subject, monopoly, years ago, long before I was in office.
[01:07:40.405 --> 01:07:41.726]  Do you think you were the man to do it?
[01:07:41.726 --> 01:07:46.848]  In fact, a lot of people thought it was going to happen, and then I guess a previous administration stopped it from happening.
[01:07:46.848 --> 01:07:48.249]  But you're in charge now?
[01:07:48.249 --> 01:07:48.909]  I am in charge.
[01:07:48.909 --> 01:07:51.510]  I am definitely in charge, and we are certainly looking at it.
[01:07:51.510 --> 01:07:53.191]  This is antitrust?
[01:07:53.191 --> 01:07:53.931]  Antitrust, yes.
[01:07:53.931 --> 01:07:54.411]  Right.
[01:07:54.411 --> 01:07:55.612]  For Amazon?
[01:07:55.612 --> 01:07:57.293]  For all three.
[01:08:03.550 --> 01:08:05.211]  And we are back live, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:08:05.211 --> 01:08:06.752]  Again, I am your host, Alex Jones.
[01:08:06.752 --> 01:08:08.554]  We are into the second hour of live coverage.
[01:08:08.554 --> 01:08:13.698]  We'll be here until midnight tonight, and then kicking off at 8 a.m.
[01:08:13.698 --> 01:08:29.050]  tomorrow, right through until as late as we have to go, until this election is called, this critical election, or until they tell us that a couple of runoff elections for the House, coming up the next few months, may put who is actually in charge into question
[01:08:30.137 --> 01:08:31.518]  For several months.
[01:08:31.518 --> 01:08:34.719]  So there may be a cliffhanger to the cliffhanger.
[01:08:34.719 --> 01:08:36.760]  Now I have a bunch of big guests coming on.
[01:08:36.760 --> 01:08:41.903]  We already had Ted Nugent on, Roger Stones in studio, like he was two years ago on election day.
[01:08:41.903 --> 01:08:43.624]  Brandon Darby, head of Breitbart Texas.
[01:08:43.624 --> 01:08:48.206]  We'll talk about the caravan and Beto and the illegal aliens.
[01:08:48.206 --> 01:08:49.546]  He's joining us.
[01:08:49.546 --> 01:08:51.587]  Millie Weaver from the campaign trail.
[01:08:51.587 --> 01:08:52.528]  Gerald Cilente.
[01:08:52.528 --> 01:08:54.669]  And then a whole big list of people.
[01:08:55.979 --> 01:09:01.142]  On the War Room at 3 o'clock with Owen Schroer and Roger Stone right through to midnight.
[01:09:01.142 --> 01:09:04.264]  And later, I'll give you a list of those folks.
[01:09:04.264 --> 01:09:07.285]  In fact, I'll do you one better like we do in past elections.
[01:09:07.285 --> 01:09:16.530]  I'll post on InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com the list of the special programming and who's coming on.
[01:09:16.530 --> 01:09:24.495]  We just got that done yesterday and we're adding more guests and more special information as that all unfolds.
[01:09:27.759 --> 01:09:47.126]  But first, let me just, in the rest of this segment, and then into the next segment some, let me go to election night as it becomes clear that Trump is going to win, but Hillary wouldn't concede for several hours, and then once she finally conceded what I said, because Roger's like, you don't look too excited.
[01:09:48.334 --> 01:09:53.218]  The New York Times took this to mean that I was upset that Hillary was getting in because my ratings would go down.
[01:09:53.218 --> 01:09:53.818]  Which is true.
[01:09:53.818 --> 01:09:58.261]  If you're a conservative or libertarian broadcaster, and Republicans tend to get in, your ratings go down.
[01:09:58.261 --> 01:09:59.182]  I don't care about that.
[01:09:59.182 --> 01:10:01.643]  Like a lot of Republicans, I don't like.
[01:10:01.643 --> 01:10:03.325]  I knew Hillary was coming after me.
[01:10:03.965 --> 01:10:05.606]  I started Hillary for Prison.
[01:10:05.606 --> 01:10:06.387]  Lock her up.
[01:10:06.387 --> 01:10:08.048]  Our audience did.
[01:10:08.048 --> 01:10:11.951]  I flew airplanes over her campaign events, you know, saying, Hillary for Prison.
[01:10:11.951 --> 01:10:13.272]  Infowars.com.
[01:10:13.272 --> 01:10:14.773]  She called me the Dark Heart.
[01:10:14.773 --> 01:10:16.594]  And she's come after me since then.
[01:10:16.594 --> 01:10:19.657]  With threats and lawsuits and all sorts of dirty tricks.
[01:10:19.657 --> 01:10:22.039]  So, that's pure bull.
[01:10:22.039 --> 01:10:26.882]  I want what's right and good for the country and the world, regardless of what it does for me.
[01:10:26.882 --> 01:10:30.145]  But only looking at, would I have more audience if Hillary got in?
[01:10:31.144 --> 01:10:35.847]  Maybe, but that doesn't matter because I wouldn't even have a show if she got in.
[01:10:35.847 --> 01:10:37.488]  This is now life and death.
[01:10:37.488 --> 01:10:40.829]  This is now existential, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:10:40.829 --> 01:10:48.254]  So here are some of those key predictions, because after I'm done giving you those predictions from two years ago, I'm going to make more here today.
[01:10:48.254 --> 01:10:49.474]  Here it is.
[01:10:49.474 --> 01:10:50.935]  Donald Trump.
[01:10:50.935 --> 01:10:57.299]  And we look at the electoral map at Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com and DrugsReport.com, and it appears
[01:10:58.544 --> 01:11:06.549]  That unless they claim every other state that hasn't been announced yet, four or five, to him, which is BS, he will be the 45th president of the United States.
[01:11:06.549 --> 01:11:11.572]  And tomorrow, Rogerson will be here, if there is this big victory, to break down, because we can't sit on our laurels.
[01:11:11.572 --> 01:11:13.433]  They're going to counter offensive.
[01:11:13.433 --> 01:11:14.614]  The empire is going to strike back.
[01:11:15.074 --> 01:11:16.455]  But I gotta shake your hand.
[01:11:16.455 --> 01:11:18.737]  What a strong showing regardless.
[01:11:18.737 --> 01:11:22.780]  I saw him claiming he was gonna lose all the media and got disheartened because I know the polls showed him winning.
[01:11:22.780 --> 01:11:24.842]  I guess that was just their con game.
[01:11:24.842 --> 01:11:27.123]  And I gotta be honest, I guess I started smoking the dope.
[01:11:27.123 --> 01:11:33.568]  The propaganda, I didn't say he was gonna lose, I just... And we're not out of the woods yet, but Roger Stone, there's a lot of celebration happening here and all over the world.
[01:11:33.568 --> 01:11:34.709]  You just talked to Trump Tower.
[01:11:34.709 --> 01:11:37.151]  The victory speech is being prepared, it's not yet.
[01:11:37.151 --> 01:11:39.493]  Give us the big, the big, I don't know.
[01:11:39.973 --> 01:11:49.299]  The folks in the Trump campaign are now satisfied that they have seen enough numbers from the outstanding states to declare victory.
[01:11:49.299 --> 01:11:56.664]  The croppers tonight, the real surprise is Wisconsin, Michigan never considered to be
[01:11:58.005 --> 01:12:13.841]  In the in the Trump orbit until late when Steve Bannon made a strategic decision seeing rising poll numbers in those states to make a major play for both states going after white blue-collar Catholic Democrats.
[01:12:14.562 --> 01:12:20.604]  Who are patriots, who are sick of these trade deals that have destroyed this country's job market.
[01:12:20.604 --> 01:12:24.546]  That will be the hidden story of tonight.
[01:12:24.546 --> 01:12:32.288]  Trade and those union members, I think, are the ones who will, in the end, put Donald Trump over the top.
[01:12:32.288 --> 01:12:36.990]  So it's Reagan Democrats that now realize globalism is an F job?
[01:12:36.990 --> 01:12:37.690]  Exactly.
[01:12:37.690 --> 01:12:40.431]  It is the Bernie supporters, in the end.
[01:12:40.431 --> 01:12:42.032]  These are the folks who supported Bernie.
[01:12:42.972 --> 01:12:46.655]  You said, be nice to them because they're going to steal it from him and we need them to understand.
[01:12:46.655 --> 01:12:47.175]  You were right.
[01:12:47.175 --> 01:12:50.958]  This will be a day long remembered if this happens.
[01:12:50.958 --> 01:13:06.890]  This will be, in the words of The Economist, in the words of The Washington Post, in the words of The Financial Times and every other CFR publication, if Hillary fell after Brexit and Russia pulling out, this will be a devastating event to their operations.
[01:13:09.928 --> 01:13:12.390]  All right, then pause right there.
[01:13:12.390 --> 01:13:15.652]  Let's stop right there and back up a few seconds, because here's the key.
[01:13:15.652 --> 01:13:19.594]  I then go into how it's going to devastate them, but how they're going to strike back.
[01:13:19.594 --> 01:13:20.555]  And that's what's really important.
[01:13:20.555 --> 01:13:29.980]  But understand, everywhere globalism is falling, from Europe to Latin America to Asia, because people now understand the scam.
[01:13:29.980 --> 01:13:33.643]  And that's why even if they win this midterm, it's because they threw everything they had
[01:13:34.628 --> 01:13:44.335]  From all over the world, ridiculously at it, and they're still going against a trend of a global awakening and global realignment.
[01:13:44.335 --> 01:13:47.196]  That's what's so critical here.
[01:13:47.196 --> 01:13:50.799]  So I don't want you to get demoralized if they win tomorrow.
[01:13:50.799 --> 01:13:53.401]  I don't think they are.
[01:13:53.401 --> 01:13:55.802]  All real indicators say the opposite.
[01:13:55.802 --> 01:14:01.766]  But, again, there's election theft, there's crime, this level of censorship.
[01:14:01.766 --> 01:14:04.288]  The fact that they would do all this criminal stuff this nakedly?
[01:14:05.560 --> 01:14:07.402]  Has Trump just talked about it earlier?
[01:14:07.402 --> 01:14:08.864]  With the censorship?
[01:14:08.864 --> 01:14:10.686]  That's illegal, folks.
[01:14:10.686 --> 01:14:12.668]  That's over the top.
[01:14:12.668 --> 01:14:14.991]  Shows they'll do anything.
[01:14:14.991 --> 01:14:16.753]  Let's finish up a little bit more before we come back from break.
[01:14:22.705 --> 01:14:23.546]  Is this Valhalla?
[01:14:23.546 --> 01:14:27.128]  Is this the best moment in your political life?
[01:14:27.128 --> 01:14:27.489]  It's amazing.
[01:14:27.489 --> 01:14:28.129]  Take my hand.
[01:14:28.129 --> 01:14:30.391]  It's... New York Times claimed I was upset here.
[01:14:30.391 --> 01:14:31.192]  Yeah, right.
[01:14:31.192 --> 01:14:31.772]  Thank you.
[01:14:31.772 --> 01:14:32.232]  Cheers.
[01:14:32.232 --> 01:14:32.633]  Love you.
[01:14:32.633 --> 01:14:33.533]  Love you guys.
[01:14:33.533 --> 01:14:34.094]  Love all of you.
[01:14:34.094 --> 01:14:34.794]  What a great moment.
[01:14:34.794 --> 01:14:36.156]  These backers want to keep us pouring?
[01:14:52.248 --> 01:14:54.549]  The tax example, the F's?
[01:14:54.549 --> 01:14:56.509]  Get ready, you're about to get F'd right back.
[01:14:56.509 --> 01:14:58.409]  And Islamists?
[01:14:58.409 --> 01:15:00.790]  Here come Christmas lists.
[01:15:00.790 --> 01:15:02.910]  God, Buckley, this is the good stuff.
[01:15:02.910 --> 01:15:05.451]  Alright, pause real quick.
[01:15:05.451 --> 01:15:09.432]  We'll back it up from the break point, come back, but understand.
[01:15:09.432 --> 01:15:11.692]  You're about to see the economy come back.
[01:15:11.692 --> 01:15:13.312]  ISIS, you're about to die.
[01:15:13.312 --> 01:15:17.373]  Notice, it all happened.
[01:15:17.373 --> 01:15:20.374]  And that's with Trump with limited control.
[01:15:22.228 --> 01:15:28.677]  As the night goes on for another hour or so, Roger Stone says, what's wrong?
[01:15:28.677 --> 01:15:37.149]  And I said, well, I can feel the eye of Sauron just went from looking at me a little bit at the time to swung around right on me.
[01:15:37.149 --> 01:15:38.090]  I'm like, huh?
[01:15:40.379 --> 01:15:42.861]  I mean, I could feel the rage.
[01:15:42.861 --> 01:15:45.103]  I could feel the enemy preparing.
[01:15:45.103 --> 01:15:52.368]  I could feel that big red eye swinging around in my direction, and that searing will to destroy me.
[01:15:52.368 --> 01:15:55.991]  Now, I rose to the challenge, but two years later, I've been through a meat grinder.
[01:15:57.364 --> 01:16:01.209]  Marijuana has unleashed a green gold rush across our nation.
[01:16:01.209 --> 01:16:04.873]  It's creating 10.8 billion dollars in new wealth a year.
[01:16:04.873 --> 01:16:09.659]  And every day, it's transforming more and more Americans into millionaires.
[01:16:09.659 --> 01:16:15.306]  In an historic event, former Speaker of the House John Boehner reveals how you could become one of them.
[01:16:15.666 --> 01:16:18.809]  Join him online for the American Cannabis Summit.
[01:16:18.809 --> 01:16:22.372]  Attendance is 100% free, but space is limited.

[01:16:26.676 --> 01:16:29.378]  This event is the first of its kind ever.
[01:16:29.378 --> 01:16:37.866]  John Boehner and an esteemed panel will reveal which cannabis stocks are primed to deliver life-changing windfalls in the weeks and months ahead.
[01:16:37.866 --> 01:16:41.629]  Plus, they will show you how to become a cannabis angel investor.
[01:16:41.949 --> 01:16:46.996]  Backing the hottest startups before they potentially become worth billions of dollars.
[01:16:46.996 --> 01:16:52.042]  To join American Cannabis Summit, text JOIN to 44055.
[01:16:52.042 --> 01:16:53.524]  Attendance is free.

[01:16:57.228 --> 01:17:02.032]  In these uncertain times, it makes sense to have a sustainable backup method to cook food and boil water.
[01:17:02.032 --> 01:17:07.917]  If your current plan includes using a fuel-burning stove or cooking over an open fire, then there's a much better way.
[01:17:07.917 --> 01:17:14.422]  The Minuteman Rocket Stove is a biomass-burning cooking stove that only requires small quantities of sticks and twigs for fuel.
[01:17:14.422 --> 01:17:18.465]  The Minuteman Stove is easy to use, smokeless, portable, powerful, and sustainable.
[01:17:18.465 --> 01:17:24.730]  For the finest in survival cooking stoves and fire starters made right here in the USA, go to MinutemanStove.com.
[01:17:24.730 --> 01:17:26.492]  That's MinutemanStove.com.
[01:17:27.512 --> 01:17:28.712]  Hear that?
[01:17:28.712 --> 01:17:34.113]  That's the sound of a house being trashed while a gang of thieves ransack the place.
[01:17:34.113 --> 01:17:36.994]  And what they don't steal will be destroyed.
[01:17:36.994 --> 01:17:40.575]  This year, resolve not to be the next victim of a break-in.
[01:17:40.575 --> 01:17:48.156]  Go to Faketv.com and discover a device that creates the illusion someone inside is watching TV, even when you're miles away.
[01:17:48.156 --> 01:17:52.757]  Security is a mindset, and Faketv should be part of your security solution.
[01:17:52.757 --> 01:17:55.178]  Be vigilant, but not fearful.

[01:17:59.958 --> 01:18:05.603]  We need to go back and revisit the foundations of our freedom.
[01:18:05.603 --> 01:18:08.746]  Our freedoms don't consist of the things that are enumerated on a piece of paper.
[01:18:08.746 --> 01:18:11.408]  It consists of the things that we're willing to fight for.
[01:18:11.408 --> 01:18:15.692]  The First Amendment, the Bill of Rights, the rest of the Bill of Rights are prohibitions.
[01:18:15.692 --> 01:18:23.199]  They're prohibitions against powerful organizations and individuals taking those God-given rights from us as individuals.
[01:18:23.199 --> 01:18:25.621]  You better understand that, because they're taking them right now.
[01:18:29.039 --> 01:18:31.261]  We have seen what they want to do.
[01:18:31.261 --> 01:18:34.303]  They called it UN Agenda 21, now they call it the UN 2030 Agenda.
[01:18:34.303 --> 01:18:46.213]  They want everybody off of the rural lands, they want people out of the suburbs, they want to pack everybody into the cities, because that's where it is easiest for them to control everyone.
[01:18:46.213 --> 01:18:47.795]  It's the David Knight Show!
[01:18:47.795 --> 01:18:50.917]  Never miss your show, any day.
[01:18:50.917 --> 01:18:51.838]  I mean, what?
[01:18:51.838 --> 01:18:52.799]  I mean, never!
[01:18:58.345 --> 01:19:02.306]  Living in volcano may sound more dramatic than it really is.
[01:19:02.306 --> 01:19:05.587]  The real drama can be found here in Leilani Estates.
[01:19:05.587 --> 01:19:11.849]  But a lot of us on the Big Island rely on rainwater and we need to be concerned about ash and acid rain.
[01:19:11.849 --> 01:19:14.610]  Volcanic ash may contain heavy metal particles.
[01:19:15.370 --> 01:19:19.193]  An acid rain could lower the pH of the water to unhealthy levels.
[01:19:19.193 --> 01:19:25.657]  To find out, we employed a series of tests for heavy metals, alkalinity, and pH.
[01:19:25.657 --> 01:19:30.621]  What we learned was that there was in fact unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity in the rainwater.
[01:19:31.365 --> 01:19:35.287]  Next, we tested the water from our Alexa Pure gravity filter.
[01:19:35.287 --> 01:19:42.491]  And not only were the heavy metal levels within safe measure, but the pH was also restored to optimal levels.
[01:19:42.491 --> 01:19:47.193]  As it turns out, the filter on the Alexa Pure raises the pH of the water.
[01:19:47.193 --> 01:19:53.397]  So what we've learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater supply.
[01:19:53.397 --> 01:19:57.379]  But more importantly, a good water filtration system will purify it.
[01:20:01.341 --> 01:20:19.752]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:19.752 --> 01:20:25.435]  He aligns himself with the truth, but it's time for you to choose a side.
[01:20:25.435 --> 01:20:27.737]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[01:20:32.401 --> 01:20:35.424]  All right, less than 20 hours out from the polls opening on the East Coast.
[01:20:35.424 --> 01:20:40.229]  We're going live until midnight tonight at InfoWars.com forward slash show.
[01:20:40.229 --> 01:20:49.998]  And the last couple elections, boy, we have millions of extra viewers that end up tuning into our streams at InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com because you send out the link and say, hey,
[01:20:50.879 --> 01:21:03.473]  There's live coverage going on right now at InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com of uncensored real analysis of the Democrats trying to steal it in live time, election meddling and more.
[01:21:03.473 --> 01:21:08.939]  If you want to know what's really going on from every angle in the big picture, tune in to NewsWars.com.
[01:21:10.054 --> 01:21:22.199]  And Infowars.com and email out to folks the pages that we post that say watch live on them so that you can share that information with folks.
[01:21:22.199 --> 01:21:37.906]  Let's go back to two years ago, two years ago tomorrow night, where we see the victory of President Trump, but then my prediction of the empire would strike back.
[01:21:37.906 --> 01:21:39.087]  Flawless victory.
[01:21:39.617 --> 01:21:40.377]  Is this Valhalla?
[01:21:40.377 --> 01:21:44.599]  Is this the best moment in your political life?
[01:21:44.599 --> 01:21:45.000]  It's amazing, man.
[01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:45.140]  It's...
[01:21:55.177 --> 01:21:55.858]  Thank you.
[01:21:55.858 --> 01:21:56.038]  Cheers.
[01:21:56.038 --> 01:21:56.558]  Love you.
[01:21:56.558 --> 01:21:56.918]  Love you guys.
[01:21:56.918 --> 01:21:57.659]  Love all of you.
[01:21:57.659 --> 01:21:58.519]  What a great moment.
[01:22:25.617 --> 01:22:28.438]  Uma's getting moved out of Pennsylvania, haven't it?
[01:22:28.438 --> 01:22:30.038]  I think we ought to go to jail.
[01:22:30.038 --> 01:22:31.139]  No more spirit vendors?
[01:22:31.139 --> 01:22:34.440]  I hear that she and her husband are both plea bargains.
[01:22:34.440 --> 01:22:36.380]  Let's get ready, here goes Trump.
[01:22:36.380 --> 01:22:37.541]  Turn it up, Donald J. Trump.
[01:22:45.843 --> 01:22:47.465]  He's going up to the microphone.
[01:22:47.465 --> 01:22:51.269]  I've been talking for like 30 hours.
[01:22:51.269 --> 01:22:55.213]  He charges into a goblin's nest.
[01:22:55.213 --> 01:22:56.414]  This is amazing.
[01:22:56.414 --> 01:23:02.060]  As long as he doesn't kiss a goblin, goblins vomit.
[01:23:02.060 --> 01:23:03.281]  Catch him in bed with a goblin.
[01:23:03.281 --> 01:23:05.623]  I don't think there's any danger of that.
[01:23:05.623 --> 01:23:07.025]  No, he defeated the goblin.
[01:23:07.025 --> 01:23:07.425]  He did it.
[01:23:10.041 --> 01:23:16.544]  Here you go again.
[01:23:16.544 --> 01:23:20.545]  I wonder what Mr. Maddow is going to be saying tomorrow.
[01:23:20.545 --> 01:23:23.786]  I'll take some more of that.
[01:23:23.786 --> 01:23:27.628]  I heard that she was a little depressed tonight.
[01:23:27.628 --> 01:23:29.829]  Oh, you heard that?
[01:23:29.829 --> 01:23:35.431]  She won't be able to make people poor and screw people over and F blacks over anymore?
[01:23:35.431 --> 01:23:38.012]  Oh, sorry, there's a big tax cut coming to the communities.
[01:23:40.177 --> 01:23:42.078]  Thank you.
[01:23:42.078 --> 01:23:44.478]  And lowest black unemployment ever?
[01:23:44.478 --> 01:23:46.499]  It's like we said.
[01:23:46.499 --> 01:23:47.840]  It's pretty amazing.
[01:23:47.840 --> 01:23:50.561]  Could you believe this is happening?
[01:23:50.561 --> 01:23:51.681]  Why do I have a bad feeling earlier today?
[01:23:51.681 --> 01:23:52.581]  This is so good.
[01:23:52.581 --> 01:23:53.582]  Okay, let's turn up Trump.
[01:23:53.582 --> 01:23:54.662]  Thank you very much.
[01:23:54.662 --> 01:23:55.862]  Let's hear it.
[01:23:55.862 --> 01:23:59.363]  The President-elect, 45.
[01:23:59.363 --> 01:24:02.404]  Yeah!
[01:24:02.404 --> 01:24:06.726]  I've just received a call from Secretary Clinton.
[01:24:11.756 --> 01:24:18.340]  She congratulated us, it's about us, on our victory.
[01:24:18.340 --> 01:24:27.464]  I pledge to every citizen of our land that I will be president for all Americans, and this is so important to me.
[01:24:27.464 --> 01:24:31.766]  Ladies and gentlemen, Donald Trump's our new president.
[01:24:31.766 --> 01:24:32.627]  This is awesome!
[01:24:32.627 --> 01:24:38.110]  Those who have chosen not to support me in the past, of which there were a few people,
[01:24:40.345 --> 01:24:49.935]  I'm reaching out to you for your guidance and your help, so that we can work together and unify our great country.
[01:24:49.935 --> 01:24:53.458]  You're not going to back off, that's what I said.
[01:24:53.458 --> 01:24:55.260]  I agree.
[01:24:55.260 --> 01:24:57.903]  We're not looking for trouble, but if you want to fight, you got it.
[01:25:00.811 --> 01:25:06.033]  We will begin the urgent task of rebuilding our nation and renewing the American dream.
[01:25:06.033 --> 01:25:08.755]  Do you imagine how they're crapping their pants right now?
[01:25:08.755 --> 01:25:15.958]  I've spent my entire life at Sursus looking at the untapped potential in projects and in people all over the world.
[01:25:15.958 --> 01:25:18.119]  They're so upset right now.
[01:25:18.119 --> 01:25:25.222]  That is now what I want to do for our country.
[01:25:25.222 --> 01:25:26.463]  Tremendous potential.
[01:25:27.489 --> 01:25:29.630]  I've gotten to know our country so well.
[01:25:29.630 --> 01:25:31.631]  Tremendous potential.
[01:25:31.631 --> 01:25:33.672]  It's going to be a beautiful thing.
[01:25:33.672 --> 01:25:41.195]  Every single American will have the opportunity to realize his or her fullest potential.
[01:25:41.195 --> 01:25:42.615]  The forgotten men and women.
[01:25:45.495 --> 01:25:48.378]  All right, we got the crew in here, delusionally happy.
[01:25:48.378 --> 01:25:52.061]  Let's hear it from, what's going on here?
[01:25:52.061 --> 01:25:59.388]  I can't, I mean, look, the thing is, good people never realize we have the power over scum.
[01:25:59.388 --> 01:26:00.589]  They have to rediscover that.
[01:26:00.589 --> 01:26:04.073]  Listen, they're going to counter-strike.
[01:26:04.073 --> 01:26:06.815]  I'm not over-confident, I'm not under-confident.
[01:26:06.815 --> 01:26:09.418]  Roger, they're going to pull some stuff.
[01:26:09.418 --> 01:26:10.419]  Obama's in for two months.
[01:26:11.584 --> 01:26:15.528]  We've got November, December, January until the 18th.
[01:26:15.528 --> 01:26:16.709]  What do we do?
[01:26:16.709 --> 01:26:18.050]  The pardons.
[01:26:18.050 --> 01:26:19.632]  I've been predicting this year.
[01:26:19.632 --> 01:26:21.854]  Alright, pause again.
[01:26:21.854 --> 01:26:27.559]  Then I go on to talk about how they're going to try to keep him from being seated as president, which they did.
[01:26:27.559 --> 01:26:32.063]  And then I went into how they were going to come after all of us that we're supporting from.
[01:26:32.063 --> 01:26:33.905]  And that's why he had to go on the offense against them.
[01:26:33.905 --> 01:26:36.006]  But he had to get the economy going first.
[01:26:36.006 --> 01:26:37.047]  Now I predict
[01:26:37.867 --> 01:26:47.796]  And I've been saying this, that as soon as these midterms are over, whether he wins back the House and Senate or not, whether we do, Trump's going on the offense against the censors, the globalists, and he has now...
[01:26:49.099 --> 01:26:53.122]  Announce that in a very, very, very, very big way.
[01:26:53.122 --> 01:26:57.745]  So we're going to come back and I'm going to air a little bit more of this right from where we left off.
[01:26:57.745 --> 01:27:00.587]  And then Roger Stone is going to be in studio with us.
[01:27:00.587 --> 01:27:02.948]  And we have a bunch of other big guests today.
[01:27:02.948 --> 01:27:06.110]  Please do not forget that we are listener and viewer supported.
[01:27:06.110 --> 01:27:10.073]  The globalists are trying to shut us down as we speak.
[01:27:10.073 --> 01:27:11.454]  I have the Washington Post calling up.
[01:27:12.611 --> 01:27:19.115]  Gloating over how they're going to write another article trying to shut Infowars down, and then how they then send the order out to the attack dogs.
[01:27:19.115 --> 01:27:21.757]  It's in like clockwork they come for us.
[01:27:21.757 --> 01:27:26.200]  So your financial support is absolutely critical to stand against these people.
[01:27:26.200 --> 01:27:29.843]  We've been able to do it so far thanks to you, and I'm thanking you.
[01:27:29.843 --> 01:27:33.445]  But we're having the biggest sale ever on targeted items.
[01:27:33.445 --> 01:27:35.366]  We just had the biggest general sale ever.
[01:27:35.366 --> 01:27:38.408]  This is the biggest on targeted items.
[01:27:39.775 --> 01:27:44.259]  The Infowar 67% off blowout sale.

[01:28:06.768 --> 01:28:10.589]  They're best sellers, but they're very expensive and hard to source and hard to get.
[01:28:10.589 --> 01:28:13.810]  Cold-pressed herbs for libido, stamina, energy.
[01:28:13.810 --> 01:28:15.211]  It's the last run of those.

[01:28:24.553 --> 01:28:27.234]  It's way better than the original X2, which was incredible.

[01:28:56.007 --> 01:28:56.387]  Stay with us.
[01:28:57.668 --> 01:28:58.868]  Hear that?
[01:28:58.868 --> 01:29:04.250]  That's the sound of a house being trashed while a gang of thieves ransack the place.
[01:29:04.250 --> 01:29:07.150]  And what they don't steal will be destroyed.
[01:29:07.150 --> 01:29:10.731]  This year, resolve not to be the next victim of a break-in.
[01:29:10.731 --> 01:29:18.313]  Go to Faketv.com and discover a device that creates the illusion someone inside is watching TV, even when you're miles away.

[01:29:22.914 --> 01:29:25.335]  Be vigilant, but not fearful.
[01:29:25.335 --> 01:29:25.775]  Faketv.com
[01:29:27.350 --> 01:29:31.232]  Most of you know that heart disease is the number one silent killer in the U.S.
[01:29:31.232 --> 01:29:36.215]  What if I told you for just $54.95 a month you could fight against heart disease naturally?
[01:29:36.215 --> 01:29:41.037]  At Heart and Body Extract, we've been helping thousands of people get back to a healthier heart.
[01:29:41.037 --> 01:29:42.378]  Don't just take my word for it.

[01:29:47.160 --> 01:29:47.520]  That's 866-295-5305.
[01:29:47.520 --> 01:29:48.081]  HBExtract.com.
[01:29:48.081 --> 01:29:50.562]  Don't risk it when you can take charge of it.
[01:29:58.362 --> 01:30:03.604]  Words cannot describe how big the stakes are for the future of humanity right now.
[01:30:03.604 --> 01:30:12.286]  InfoWars is being openly targeted by the Democratic Party, leftist CIA operatives, the corrupt Justice Department, and the entire Soros crime syndicate.
[01:30:12.286 --> 01:30:14.287]  People say, why would you start a fight with them?
[01:30:14.287 --> 01:30:17.728]  Because they were already dominating and running America into the ground.
[01:30:17.728 --> 01:30:20.348]  And I knew we had no future if we didn't do this.
[01:30:20.348 --> 01:30:21.909]  So we've already had incredible success.
[01:30:22.629 --> 01:30:35.058]  But if you will simply realize how epic this is, and understand how real this fight is, and why we've been made the main target, and if you financially support us, and if you spread the word about our articles and videos, InfoWars.com,
[01:30:36.215 --> 01:30:39.917]  We won't just continue to stand up against these brutal scumbags.
[01:30:39.917 --> 01:30:41.118]  We'll win.
[01:30:41.118 --> 01:30:44.019]  We have huge sales at InfoWarsStore.com right now.
[01:30:44.019 --> 01:30:51.163]  And we're still able to operate the shopping cart and get stuff shipped out to you, despite the fact that we're trying to block our commerce and your right to the market.
[01:30:51.163 --> 01:30:54.865]  But if you don't stand up and support us financially, Soros the Globalist may win.
[01:30:54.865 --> 01:30:56.086]  This is InfoWarsDarknessHour.
[01:30:56.086 --> 01:30:57.287]  We need your support.
[01:30:57.287 --> 01:30:57.827]  I'm counting on you.
[01:30:58.087 --> 01:31:02.191]  We all know that the outside toxins in the water is a serious health issue.
[01:31:02.191 --> 01:31:09.277]  InfoWars is proud to sell incredible filters, but it's almost impossible to keep up with every faucet, shower, and sink in your home.
[01:31:09.277 --> 01:31:14.082]  That's why we're bringing you something to provide clean water for your whole house with one system.
[01:31:14.082 --> 01:31:20.988]  The Pro-Pure Whole House Water Filtration System is an advanced four-stage compact filtration system
[01:31:21.408 --> 01:31:27.411]  That will provide water filtration for your entire home, removing 220 plus contaminants from your water.
[01:31:27.411 --> 01:31:36.555]  It's compact in size, easy to install and maintain, and keeps fluoride and other dangerous toxins out of your water supply and away from you and your family.
[01:31:36.995 --> 01:31:44.461]  With its broad-spectrum contaminant reduction, you'll only need this one filter for clean and refreshing water all over your home.

[01:32:04.503 --> 01:32:11.324]  If you're not in the market for one of our greatest nutraceuticals, please consider a contribution.
[01:32:11.324 --> 01:32:26.848]  $25, $50, $100, $250, or even $500 would be a godsend to our important work here to beat back the globalists and to destroy their campaign of censorship in which they want to strangle our First Amendment rights.
[01:32:28.007 --> 01:32:31.850]  Hey, how would you like to take InfoWars with you wherever you go?
[01:32:31.850 --> 01:32:37.093]  Well, now you can do just that with the new official InfoWars app.

[01:32:38.394 --> 01:32:40.215]  It is absolutely free.
[01:32:40.215 --> 01:32:45.439]  At the Apple Store and Google Play, you can join the InfoWars today.
[01:32:45.439 --> 01:32:49.401]  Check it out right now at InfoWars.com forward slash app app.
[01:32:49.401 --> 01:32:53.524]  It's the InfoWars official app taken on the globalist at point blank range.
[01:32:53.524 --> 01:32:57.627]  And with your help spreading it and with your help downloading it, we are unstoppable.
[01:33:00.730 --> 01:33:03.353]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:43.149 --> 01:33:43.829]  Over a year.
[01:33:43.829 --> 01:33:49.631]  I want to tell the world community that while we will only... So who's your bully pulpit trying to block that?
[01:33:50.353 --> 01:33:51.634]  We will deal fairly.
[01:34:12.463 --> 01:34:16.747]  I thought Reagan's election was the greatest political high you could have.
[01:34:16.747 --> 01:34:18.729]  This is ten times better.
[01:34:18.729 --> 01:34:22.312]  I want to thank my parents, who I know are looking down on me right now.
[01:34:22.312 --> 01:34:23.913]  Oh, the public only knew how good it was.
[01:34:23.913 --> 01:34:25.174]  That's why they're so scared.
[01:34:25.174 --> 01:34:26.295]  Jesus.
[01:34:26.295 --> 01:34:28.037]  God, no wonder they're freaking out.
[01:34:28.037 --> 01:34:29.758]  They've got our phones tapped, everything.
[01:34:29.758 --> 01:34:33.141]  They're hearing the conversations behind the scenes.
[01:34:33.141 --> 01:34:34.282]  They're watching Donald Trump.
[01:34:34.282 --> 01:34:35.603]  So they know what we're really thinking about.
[01:34:35.603 --> 01:34:36.764]  Read our articles every day.
[01:34:36.764 --> 01:34:38.125]  They're shitting their pants.
[01:34:38.866 --> 01:34:40.829]  We just want to cut taxes and make everybody rich.
[01:34:40.829 --> 01:34:43.612]  Everybody get along with each other.
[01:34:43.612 --> 01:34:45.255]  They are so pissed right now.
[01:34:45.255 --> 01:34:46.676]  All these old bankers.
[01:34:46.676 --> 01:34:47.537]  Where is Robert?
[01:34:47.537 --> 01:34:48.499]  Where is Robert?
[01:34:54.560 --> 01:34:55.781]  My brother, Robert.
[01:34:55.781 --> 01:34:57.122]  Yeah, Flood's great.
[01:34:57.122 --> 01:34:58.102]  And no, this is perfect.
[01:34:58.102 --> 01:35:00.083]  The point is, he's not out to get us.
[01:35:00.083 --> 01:35:01.344]  This is a major victory.
[01:35:01.344 --> 01:35:02.985]  This is going to shake the world.
[01:35:02.985 --> 01:35:05.486]  We should talk about how they're going to counterstrike.
[01:35:05.486 --> 01:35:06.767]  They're going to be a counterstrike.
[01:35:06.767 --> 01:35:09.489]  We have all day tomorrow to talk about that.
[01:35:09.489 --> 01:35:11.149]  Tonight, I just want to celebrate.
[01:35:11.149 --> 01:35:11.870]  I agree.
[01:35:11.870 --> 01:35:12.570]  This is surreal.
[01:35:12.570 --> 01:35:13.871]  This victory is truly disgustingly great.
[01:35:25.367 --> 01:35:28.952]  Our work on this movement is now really just beginning.
[01:35:28.952 --> 01:35:29.452]  That's right.
[01:35:29.452 --> 01:35:31.575]  The battle starts now.
[01:35:31.575 --> 01:35:34.699]  We have to deliver tax cuts, industry, jobs, not wars.
[01:35:36.618 --> 01:35:39.760]  Tell me, Roger, he's not going to start a war, right?
[01:35:39.760 --> 01:35:41.181]  I don't think he's going to start a war.
[01:35:41.181 --> 01:35:43.482]  Please, God, I don't have the votes.
[01:35:43.482 --> 01:35:45.223]  You'll be so proud.
[01:35:45.223 --> 01:35:46.764]  Again, it's my honor.
[01:35:46.764 --> 01:35:48.725]  It was an amazing evening.
[01:35:48.725 --> 01:35:51.467]  It's been an amazing two-year period.
[01:35:51.467 --> 01:35:54.749]  And I love this country.
[01:35:54.749 --> 01:35:55.989]  Thank you.
[01:35:55.989 --> 01:35:56.830]  Thank you very much.
[01:35:57.610 --> 01:35:59.752]  I mean, this is awesome.
[01:35:59.752 --> 01:36:00.893]  Now is the delivery.
[01:36:00.893 --> 01:36:04.255]  Because with Hillary, she's not as good as we know that.
[01:36:04.255 --> 01:36:07.138]  But what does Hillary do with all her crimes?
[01:36:07.138 --> 01:36:09.339]  It's kind of like saying, hey, we'll leave you alone, go away.
[01:36:09.339 --> 01:36:10.440]  I get that, like, absentia.
[01:36:10.440 --> 01:36:12.722]  I'm gonna be honest.
[01:36:12.722 --> 01:36:17.185]  It's like everything I've ever done, you two, it's like we're winning.
[01:36:17.185 --> 01:36:20.188]  It's just, they say America isn't special, but it is.
[01:36:21.266 --> 01:36:29.451]  It's like if you believe in her and you stand for her, in the end you get everything.
[01:36:29.451 --> 01:36:31.573]  And that's what made America so special.
[01:36:31.573 --> 01:36:33.294]  That's why they hate this country.
[01:36:33.294 --> 01:36:39.998]  And Trump, I don't know Trump like you do, but it seems like he dialed into the spirit of our age.
[01:36:39.998 --> 01:36:42.540]  And he knows, he gets behind him.
[01:36:42.540 --> 01:36:45.682]  He seems to have the confidence to know it can't be stopped.
[01:36:45.682 --> 01:36:48.864]  Can you just spend a few minutes elaborating on that, Roger Stone?
[01:36:49.966 --> 01:36:55.829]  Look, I think that we're in a historic moment where the country's in desperate trouble.
[01:36:55.829 --> 01:37:11.696]  Alex, we needed a leader, somebody with courage, somebody with balls, somebody who didn't buy into the globalist agenda, who is a nationalist, who believes in American power, American sovereignty, American exceptionalism.
[01:37:12.805 --> 01:37:25.651]  The time and the events have come together at a perfect precipice for a new American revolution.
[01:37:25.651 --> 01:37:26.492]  I'm just proud.
[01:37:26.492 --> 01:37:27.912]  This makes you believe in God, doesn't it?
[01:37:27.912 --> 01:37:33.795]  It's so, I look at everything I've done over 21 years on air, 22 years, it all was building.
[01:37:33.795 --> 01:37:35.876]  Everything I did was just a launch point.
[01:37:35.876 --> 01:37:37.757]  It was all, it's crazy.
[01:37:38.477 --> 01:37:43.458]  People that don't know God don't know that everything was this, and I realize what's coming next.
[01:37:43.458 --> 01:37:44.559]  It's crazy.
[01:37:44.559 --> 01:37:49.560]  It is a great time to be alive, but the fight is just beginning.
[01:37:49.560 --> 01:37:52.641]  Now we've determined who will be our leader.
[01:37:52.641 --> 01:37:54.781]  The globalists aren't going to go down easy.
[01:37:54.781 --> 01:37:57.782]  You know that they still have tricks up their sleeve and enormous power.
[01:37:57.782 --> 01:38:03.584]  No, just because we got a knight on the horse in the armor with a sword, or with a joust, exactly.
[01:38:04.304 --> 01:38:09.328]  We are about to do battle for the Lord, and we're going to take back our country.
[01:38:09.328 --> 01:38:11.109]  It's an exciting night.
[01:38:11.109 --> 01:38:12.871]  What are the big epic talks?
[01:38:12.871 --> 01:38:19.876]  Because everything the system did, every power they had, has been brought low and has failed.
[01:38:19.876 --> 01:38:23.359]  Not that we're so pure, that they're so defiled.
[01:38:23.359 --> 01:38:24.259]  They're so low.
[01:38:25.060 --> 01:38:27.501]  That's why we're gods compared to them.
[01:38:27.501 --> 01:38:33.625]  And as they discover this endless cycle of how they attain power, they take us over.
[01:38:33.625 --> 01:38:34.525]  They think they're God.
[01:38:34.525 --> 01:38:35.426]  They become arrogant.
[01:38:35.426 --> 01:38:36.706]  They fall.
[01:38:36.706 --> 01:38:43.650]  They are experiencing now that, that which we've always experienced and knew was there.
[01:38:43.650 --> 01:38:45.571]  How do they strike back in the 21st century?
[01:38:45.571 --> 01:38:47.613]  In closing, we'll end this live transmission.
[01:38:47.613 --> 01:38:49.153]  We've got crew coming in.
[01:38:49.153 --> 01:38:51.355]  They're going to cover it, Owen Schroer and others.
[01:38:51.355 --> 01:38:53.356]  But I'm so glad you were here.
[01:38:54.210 --> 01:38:57.651]  Are you glad you came to InfoWars for this historic announcement?
[01:38:57.651 --> 01:39:01.773]  Donald Trump, 45th President of the United States.
[01:39:01.773 --> 01:39:08.456]  I'm just glad I had the opportunity to share this moment with 26 million of my closest friends.
[01:39:08.456 --> 01:39:09.576]  I'm delighted to be here.
[01:39:09.576 --> 01:39:10.776]  It's a great night.
[01:39:10.776 --> 01:39:11.557]  I'm punch drunk.
[01:39:11.557 --> 01:39:12.837]  I need some sleep.
[01:39:12.837 --> 01:39:16.258]  But we'll be back here tomorrow and talk about the challenges ahead.
[01:39:16.258 --> 01:39:20.240]  So, we're not totally dominating, but we're winning.
[01:39:20.240 --> 01:39:22.341]  This is a repudiation of the establishment.
[01:39:23.280 --> 01:39:24.722]  In spades.
[01:39:24.722 --> 01:39:27.105]  It's a new American revolution.
[01:39:27.105 --> 01:39:28.367]  We're starting over again.
[01:39:28.367 --> 01:39:30.549]  And the sky's the limit.
[01:39:30.549 --> 01:39:38.440]  When you have a leader with the kind of confidence and the kind of ability and the kind of independence that Trump has, anything is possible.
[01:39:39.266 --> 01:39:44.272]  Has the Infowar, Roger, in closing, not delivered in the Trumpian revolution?
[01:39:44.272 --> 01:39:46.414]  This is the tip of the spear, as you said it.
[01:39:46.414 --> 01:39:49.538]  This is Resistance Central.
[01:39:49.538 --> 01:39:58.268]  In the whole pantheon, in the constellation of the Resistance, the globalists, is Infowars not the critical spirit?
[01:39:58.909 --> 01:40:01.830]  That resonated with Trump and gave us the victory.
[01:40:01.830 --> 01:40:04.351]  I think it gave us our shock troops.
[01:40:04.351 --> 01:40:11.874]  I think it gave us the army of people who went into these primaries, who worked their fingers to the bone, who delivered these victories.
[01:40:11.874 --> 01:40:13.154]  Trump said it again tonight.
[01:40:13.154 --> 01:40:14.455]  This isn't about him.
[01:40:14.455 --> 01:40:17.316]  It's about you, the people.
[01:40:17.316 --> 01:40:19.817]  I think back on the Reagan campaign and think how
[01:40:20.837 --> 01:40:25.404]  How much easier it would have been if there had been an InfoWars at that time.
[01:40:25.404 --> 01:40:28.068]  This is, this is the New American Revolution.
[01:40:28.068 --> 01:40:31.232]  This is where communications among people...
[01:40:37.361 --> 01:40:38.162]  Get me Roger Stone.
[01:40:38.162 --> 01:40:39.984]  A large part of it was that night.
[01:40:39.984 --> 01:40:40.924]  Hillary and others were watching.
[01:40:40.924 --> 01:40:45.949]  They heard you say, if we had Infowars, winning for Reagan would have been easier.
[01:40:45.949 --> 01:40:49.773]  Well, now they've tried to take Infowars and tens of thousands of other sites away.
[01:40:49.773 --> 01:40:52.895]  But the good news is, Trump was trying to restart the economy.
[01:40:54.016 --> 01:40:55.297]  And prove he could do that.
[01:40:55.297 --> 01:41:09.063]  Whether we win this midterm or not, Roger, he's now announced to Axios and others he's going after Big Tech for antitrust and for violating free speech and the Federal Election Commission violations and this incredible corruption we've seen.
[01:41:09.063 --> 01:41:10.264]  That's the big issue.
[01:41:10.264 --> 01:41:16.667]  The Democrats didn't have any real proof of Russian collusion or Republicans engaged in fraud.
[01:41:16.667 --> 01:41:18.187]  But we really do have them.
[01:41:18.187 --> 01:41:21.269]  They've been so reckless the last two years that even if we win,
[01:41:21.949 --> 01:41:25.492]  We must go on the offense because they've involved themselves in such criminal activity.
[01:41:25.492 --> 01:41:27.715]  It's our duty, not just our right.
[01:41:27.715 --> 01:41:29.336]  We talked a lot about this this weekend.
[01:41:29.336 --> 01:41:34.741]  We're going to go to break in about a minute and a half, but Roger, we'll talk about your prediction for the election when we come back.
[01:41:34.741 --> 01:41:41.087]  Again, former head of the Trump campaign, been involved since the Nixon days in campaigns and were instrumental with Reagan and others.
[01:41:41.087 --> 01:41:44.190]  Gut level though, do you think Trump's going to go after him?
[01:41:44.190 --> 01:41:44.530]  He better.
[01:41:45.211 --> 01:41:48.853]  Well, the real question, Alex, is why didn't he do it ahead of this election?
[01:41:48.853 --> 01:42:00.801]  I mean, if we lose the House tomorrow, it will be because of a flood of illegal votes and net censorship, which shifted the control of the political narrative back to the mainstream media.
[01:42:00.801 --> 01:42:02.082]  Those would be the two factors.
[01:42:02.082 --> 01:42:05.525]  So he said the right things, but he has not done the right things.
[01:42:05.525 --> 01:42:10.348]  As I told you yesterday, my guess is he said to Rod Rosenstein, the de facto Attorney General,
[01:42:10.848 --> 01:42:13.210]  Rod, take care of this internet thing, will ya?
[01:42:13.210 --> 01:42:15.753]  And Rod said, yes boss, I'll do it right away.
[01:42:15.753 --> 01:42:17.234]  And they've done nothing.
[01:42:17.234 --> 01:42:22.319]  And I think it's going to, it is potentially going to cost Republicans very badly on Tuesday.
[01:42:23.715 --> 01:42:28.116]  You're foreshadowing there that you think we'll tell people what you privately told me.
[01:42:28.116 --> 01:42:29.457]  Let's just do it when we come back.
[01:42:29.457 --> 01:42:29.897]  Alright.
[01:42:29.897 --> 01:42:34.439]  And I hope you're wrong and I think you probably are wrong, except the fraud is so overwhelming.
[01:42:34.439 --> 01:42:36.399]  But we'll talk about it with Roger Stone.
[01:42:36.399 --> 01:42:38.340]  We have huge breaking news straight ahead.
[01:42:38.340 --> 01:42:43.762]  We'll have that video for you coming up too of the President saying he's going after the big tech companies and so much more.
[01:42:43.762 --> 01:42:47.803]  We'll be live till midnight tonight and then tomorrow we'll be live for over 24 hours.
[01:42:47.803 --> 01:42:49.524]  That's why at 3 a.m.
[01:42:49.524 --> 01:42:52.125]  we sounded like toads in that video.
[01:42:52.125 --> 01:42:53.065]  It was not the champagne.
[01:43:01.297 --> 01:43:07.020]  Years ago, InfoWarsLife created the powerful MycoZX formula to help you combat internal yeast.
[01:43:07.020 --> 01:43:14.904]  As the years went on, and more toxins were pumped into the environment, our team knew we had to create a bigger and better formula to help support your gut health.
[01:43:14.904 --> 01:43:18.026]  MycoZX Plus is the result of the search for that formula.
[01:43:18.226 --> 01:43:26.277]  A unique natural formula designed to support the body's natural cleansing of yeast and fungal organisms, there's no better product to help your body fight back.
[01:43:26.277 --> 01:43:35.290]  MycoZX Plus helps support a healthy microbial balance in the body, supports your digestive tract, and addresses the intestinal yeast that can cause you problems if it goes unchecked.
[01:43:35.430 --> 01:43:47.281]  Powered by an impressive list of ingredients, including Grapefruit Seed Extract, Pau Darko Bark, and Grape Seed Extract, our formula is fueled by ingredients that stood the test of time as powerful micro-balancing properties.

[01:43:56.963 --> 01:44:06.251]  The globalists know that if they suppress the good halogen and pump the environment full of the bad halogens, fluoride, chlorine, bromine, you name it, that it lowers IQ.
[01:44:06.251 --> 01:44:09.114]  It literally dumbs the population down.
[01:44:09.114 --> 01:44:15.160]  And on our quest to bring our listeners and viewers the best iodine in the world, we've gone through two permutations.
[01:44:15.820 --> 01:44:22.085]  First, seaweed-based iodine that was pretty good, but hard to source, and the Globeless tried to block us getting a supply of it.
[01:44:22.085 --> 01:44:28.391]  So we discovered deep-earth crystals of pure nascent iodine and brought you X2 that's been incredible.
[01:44:28.391 --> 01:44:35.416]  Now, due to the Establishment trying to block that, we did more research and secured more of the deep-earth crystals of nascent iodine.
[01:44:35.416 --> 01:44:35.616]  But!
[01:44:36.457 --> 01:44:49.481]  Chemists, scientists, and others showed us the research that by combining it with three other compounds, two forms of iodine and vitamin C, it supercharges it and makes it even more bioavailable.
[01:44:49.481 --> 01:44:53.742]  Ladies and gentlemen, you want to research it, you want to see it, it's an incredible discovery.
[01:44:53.742 --> 01:44:55.723]  X3, now available at m4slife.com.

[01:45:56.134 --> 01:46:04.141]  Our grandparents, our great-grandparents knew that they canned food during the fall so they'd have it during the winter.
[01:46:04.141 --> 01:46:07.103]  And that's what I'm talking about at InfoWarsTour.com.

[01:47:08.579 --> 01:47:10.500]  I'm watching the midterms.
[01:47:10.500 --> 01:47:14.362]  Man, you would think our country is Mad Max Thunderdome.
[01:47:14.362 --> 01:47:17.924]  This guy is like, they're coming from Guatemala, they're coming from Mexico.
[01:47:17.924 --> 01:47:19.104]  There's a liberal mob that's coming.
[01:47:19.104 --> 01:47:19.725]  You bought a truck!
[01:47:19.725 --> 01:47:20.625]  You bought a truck!
[01:47:20.625 --> 01:47:20.865]  Yeah!
[01:47:20.865 --> 01:47:21.165]  Bitch!
[01:47:21.165 --> 01:47:22.026]  What's up, bitch?
[01:47:22.026 --> 01:47:22.786]  What's up, bitch?
[01:47:22.786 --> 01:47:23.367]  What's up, bitch?
[01:47:23.367 --> 01:47:23.907]  What's up, bitch?
[01:47:23.907 --> 01:47:24.367]  What's up, bitch?
[01:47:24.367 --> 01:47:24.767]  What's up, bitch?
[01:47:24.767 --> 01:47:25.408]  What's up, bitch?
[01:47:25.408 --> 01:47:25.948]  What's up, bitch?
[01:47:25.948 --> 01:47:26.528]  What's up, bitch?
[01:47:26.528 --> 01:47:27.549]  What's up, bitch?
[01:47:27.549 --> 01:47:28.209]  What's up, bitch?
[01:47:28.209 --> 01:47:28.869]  What's up, bitch?
[01:47:28.869 --> 01:47:29.410]  What's up, bitch?
[01:47:29.410 --> 01:47:29.950]  What's up, bitch?
[01:47:29.950 --> 01:47:30.630]  What's up, bitch?
[01:47:30.630 --> 01:47:31.831]  What's up, bitch?
[01:47:31.831 --> 01:47:32.371]  What's up, bitch?
[01:47:32.371 --> 01:47:32.931]  What's up, bitch?
[01:47:32.931 --> 01:47:33.552]  What's up, bitch?
[01:47:33.552 --> 01:47:34.112]  What's up, bitch?
[01:47:34.112 --> 01:47:34.492]  What's up, bitch?
[01:47:34.492 --> 01:47:35.112]  What's up, bitch?
[01:47:35.112 --> 01:47:35.833]  What's up, bitch?
[01:47:35.833 --> 01:47:36.493]  What's up, bitch?
[01:47:36.493 --> 01:47:36.853]  What's up, bitch?
[01:47:36.853 --> 01:47:37.674]  What's up, bitch?
[01:47:37.674 --> 01:47:38.054]  What's up, bitch?
[01:47:41.612 --> 01:48:03.884]  And you would think everybody in the country is just like, to the bunker.
[01:48:12.173 --> 01:48:16.616]  Well, Roger Stone's here in studio, and he was here two years ago, and he was predicting a Trump victory.
[01:48:16.616 --> 01:48:25.103]  So was I. I see a lot of indicators in the polls and things that are always skewed that the polls are closer than they were two years ago.
[01:48:25.103 --> 01:48:30.767]  And I see massive turnout by Republicans, but also see massive turnout by Democrats.
[01:48:30.767 --> 01:48:34.309]  And I'm still hoping for a victory tomorrow.
[01:48:34.309 --> 01:48:36.031]  But bottom line, we talked this weekend.
[01:48:37.639 --> 01:48:47.662]  Less than 20 hours out from the polls opening on the East Coast, we've got to challenge the fraud and challenge the elections that they steal because they've already been involved in election meddling.
[01:48:47.662 --> 01:48:49.243]  The Chinese have been involved.
[01:48:49.243 --> 01:48:50.863]  The EU's been involved.
[01:48:50.863 --> 01:49:02.987]  As you said to me this weekend, as we talked about this, and we've allowed this massive un-American censorship, so let's give people, because I respect you, not saying you're 100% right, but let's give people the bad news.
[01:49:03.598 --> 01:49:06.419]  Well, Alex, my concern here is this.
[01:49:06.419 --> 01:49:19.403]  If we had an honest election, without fraud and without internet censorship, which has returned the mainstream media's power to control the political narrative, I think the Republicans would win.
[01:49:19.403 --> 01:49:22.984]  Even as we speak, I fear that we're being robbed blind.
[01:49:22.984 --> 01:49:28.246]  I hope I'm wrong, but let's take my home state of Florida, where you have a very close governor's race, very close U.S.
[01:49:28.246 --> 01:49:28.686]  Senate race.
[01:49:29.702 --> 01:49:33.183]  Any person can register online and then show up and vote.
[01:49:33.183 --> 01:49:36.364]  How do we know that that person is who they say they are?
[01:49:36.364 --> 01:49:40.965]  How do we know that that person is a United States citizen eligible to vote?
[01:49:40.965 --> 01:49:42.065]  We don't.
[01:49:42.065 --> 01:49:47.107]  We are being flooded, I fear, across the country by illegal voters.
[01:49:47.107 --> 01:49:50.648]  So it's not a lack of confidence in Republican turnout.
[01:49:50.648 --> 01:49:52.368]  We're going to get our vote out.
[01:49:52.368 --> 01:49:55.069]  I think the president's done a great job on the stump.
[01:49:55.649 --> 01:50:03.014]  Energizing his supporters, framing the election, something I called for him to do here on InfoWars week after week.
[01:50:03.014 --> 01:50:05.256]  You can't credit him for lack of effort.
[01:50:05.256 --> 01:50:10.540]  He has busted his tail to energize his base and then some.
[01:50:10.540 --> 01:50:12.961]  But I don't know if we're going to get an honest count.
[01:50:12.961 --> 01:50:13.702]  That's my concern.
[01:50:15.507 --> 01:50:29.115]  And for me, whether we win or lose, if we don't go after the Democrats, they've set the precedent for draconian censorship, for outside money, for veto, getting all the hundred plus million dollars and spending a bunch of it to fund caravans.
[01:50:29.115 --> 01:50:32.877]  And the Democrats openly saying now they're the anti-American party.
[01:50:33.397 --> 01:50:36.781]  I mean, we've got to have decisive victories in the future against these people.
[01:50:36.781 --> 01:50:38.083]  We're dealing with cancer.
[01:50:38.083 --> 01:50:43.289]  That can only happen if the President takes control of his Justice Department.
[01:50:43.289 --> 01:50:49.316]  As I told you this weekend, and I really firmly believe this, the President completely understands the issue of internet censorship.
[01:50:49.796 --> 01:50:57.282]  He knows that Infowars and dozens of other conservatives, libertarians, republicans are being censored.
[01:50:57.282 --> 01:51:05.408]  So he calls in his acting de facto Attorney General, Rod Rosenstein, and he says, Rod, take care of this internet thing, will you, sir?
[01:51:05.408 --> 01:51:06.289]  Will you please?
[01:51:06.289 --> 01:51:08.911]  And Rosenstein says, yes, sir, I'll get right on it.
[01:51:08.911 --> 01:51:13.214]  And then nothing happens because Rosenstein is part of the deep state.
[01:51:13.214 --> 01:51:18.679]  So the president's heart is in the right place, but he does not control his Justice Department and they have done nothing.
[01:51:19.179 --> 01:51:21.682]  Nothing about voter fraud in this election.
[01:51:34.679 --> 01:51:38.661]  Puts Republicans one point ahead in race for Congress.
[01:51:38.661 --> 01:51:44.623]  Survey contradicts every other poll showing Dems likely to take the House.
[01:51:44.623 --> 01:51:54.067]  A shock new Rasmussen poll released on the eve of tomorrow's election puts Republicans on point to be one point ahead in the race for Congress as an index of all the races.
[01:51:54.067 --> 01:51:58.669]  I mean, we saw 10, 15, 20 points being over-sampled for Democrats last time.
[01:51:58.669 --> 01:52:03.471]  That was one reason I thought Trump was going to win, plus I saw the energy and what was happening in the areas of the Democrats.
[01:52:03.931 --> 01:52:11.694]  So even though they've gotten a lot of people to vote in the names of dead people and there's massive fraud and a lot of illegal aliens voting, they've busted them all over the country doing it.
[01:52:11.694 --> 01:52:17.755]  Despite that, I think this Democrat seawall of fraud, this blue wall, is not going to block the red wave.
[01:52:17.755 --> 01:52:25.158]  I just have a gut-level feeling that it's going to be very, very close, down to the wire, that everybody drags out their aunts and uncles and grandma and grandpa.
[01:52:25.638 --> 01:52:30.143]  Your sons and daughters to vote, especially in battleground states, that we're going to be able to win this.
[01:52:30.143 --> 01:52:30.784]  You're right, though.
[01:52:30.784 --> 01:52:41.416]  Things like the hurricane destroying the most conservative area of the panhandle, where there's just nowhere to even vote, that is kind of the poison lining for the Democrats to help them win.
[01:52:41.656 --> 01:52:46.641]  Yeah, that's an act of nature that nobody could prevent, but it could cost us the governorship and a U.S.
[01:52:46.641 --> 01:52:48.123]  Senate seat.
[01:52:48.123 --> 01:52:53.428]  Rasmussen has an eerie record for accuracy.
[01:52:53.428 --> 01:52:57.753]  I'm uncertain of their methodology, but you can't argue with results.
[01:52:57.753 --> 01:52:59.214]  I certainly hope that he is right.
[01:52:59.895 --> 01:53:03.117]  I do think we've come a long way from behind.
[01:53:03.117 --> 01:53:07.719]  In other words, I do think pre-Kavanaugh, we were heading for a drubbing.
[01:53:07.719 --> 01:53:14.803]  Kavanaugh, I think, galvanized the President's base, and people saw the lawlessness of the Democrats.
[01:53:14.803 --> 01:53:19.365]  They saw them actively promoting violence, and they didn't like it.
[01:53:19.365 --> 01:53:23.547]  And they saw the attempted lynching of Judge Kavanaugh, and they didn't like it.
[01:53:23.547 --> 01:53:27.689]  And now, the media, the controlled media, just totally cut it off once we didn't buy it.
[01:53:29.310 --> 01:53:29.870]  Well, uh, if you...
[01:53:52.023 --> 01:53:55.505]  We want to see what's going to happen if the Democrats take the House.
[01:53:55.505 --> 01:53:57.246]  Look at the Kavanaugh example.
[01:53:57.246 --> 01:54:00.448]  This was the dress rehearsal for the takedown of Donald Trump.
[01:54:00.448 --> 01:54:02.470]  This was their dry run.
[01:54:02.470 --> 01:54:04.131]  You're going to see a duplicate.
[01:54:04.131 --> 01:54:15.678]  If the Democrats take the House, Jerry Nadler and Adam Schiff and Eric Swalwell and other vermin like that will move articles of impeachment against the President.
[01:54:15.678 --> 01:54:18.960]  Since they have nothing on Russian collusion, nothing at all,
[01:54:19.640 --> 01:54:26.769]  They're going to recycle the 19 women who made false accusations against our president during the 2016 campaign.
[01:54:26.769 --> 01:54:32.395]  They will have no more evidence than the accusers of Kavanaugh, but we're going to be told.
[01:54:32.395 --> 01:54:36.260]  They must be believed because they're survivors.
[01:54:36.260 --> 01:54:39.404]  This is coming as sure as night comes after day.
[01:54:40.549 --> 01:54:41.530]  If we lose the House.
[01:54:41.530 --> 01:54:48.935]  You predicted a year ago that the way they were setting it up to come after you last, and I guess my name's in the hopper too, that they're planning to hang everything on you.
[01:54:48.935 --> 01:54:58.882]  That's now admitted with no evidence, absolutely ridiculous, that they're planning to hang the entire Russia fable, the fiasco, on you.
[01:54:58.882 --> 01:55:10.110]  And they're saying all over the news, is there any truth to it, because they lie so much, Politico, New York Times, Washington Post, that right after the election that Mueller's going to the barrels, whatever that means.
[01:55:10.590 --> 01:55:12.991]  What they're saying is it's Stone's time in the barrel.
[01:55:12.991 --> 01:55:15.811]  Look, there's a lot of fiction and disinformation out there.
[01:55:15.811 --> 01:55:19.512]  Newsweek, the New York Times, and others.
[01:55:19.512 --> 01:55:26.234]  The truth is, there is no evidence whatsoever that I had received, had communication with Assange.
[01:55:26.234 --> 01:55:36.036]  There's no evidence that I received anything including allegedly hacked emails from him, or the Russians, or WikiLeaks, or Guccifer, or Jerry Corsi, or Santa Claus.
[01:55:36.756 --> 01:55:40.898]  It's a false, it's a canard, a fairy tale.
[01:55:40.898 --> 01:55:45.180]  So will they try to hook up some phony charge against me?
[01:55:45.180 --> 01:55:51.243]  Yeah, because I was effective in helping elect our president, because the left hates me because of it.
[01:55:51.963 --> 01:55:57.811]  I wasn't hyping the WikiLeaks disclosures to aggrandize myself, Alex.
[01:55:57.811 --> 01:56:02.939]  I was hyping them so that the voters and the media would pay attention to the news.
[01:56:02.939 --> 01:56:04.941]  Well, that was our whole strategy.
[01:56:04.941 --> 01:56:05.903]  We set it on air.
[01:56:05.903 --> 01:56:07.205]  We hyped it all up.
[01:56:07.205 --> 01:56:07.705]  Everybody did.
[01:56:08.266 --> 01:56:11.048]  But the point is, I acted on the basis of a tip.
[01:56:11.048 --> 01:56:14.029]  The tipster now denies that he gave me that tip.
[01:56:14.029 --> 01:56:16.331]  He has perjured himself.
[01:56:16.331 --> 01:56:29.178]  Mr. Mueller is well aware of the fact that there's an exculpatory witness that they have interviewed, who confirmed that Randy Credico, the progressive radio host, told me that this was coming, told me that it was big.
[01:56:29.178 --> 01:56:35.602]  Well, I don't want to get sucked into this, but you told me it's a talk show host in New York, he's going to England, I hope he gets a meeting and finds out what's in it.
[01:56:36.042 --> 01:56:42.909]  But Wikileaks has said that it's going to really embarrass Clinton and Podesta because Assange had said that on TV.
[01:56:42.909 --> 01:56:45.071]  I was constantly trying to find out what was in there.
[01:56:45.071 --> 01:56:47.533]  I could never find out the substance or the source.
[01:56:47.533 --> 01:56:49.035]  I didn't know either.
[01:56:49.035 --> 01:56:59.385]  All I was told by my source beginning in early July and then with greater specificity afterwards that it was big, devastating, a bombshell, was going to take down Hillary.
[01:56:59.565 --> 01:57:03.827]  He was, and when he didn't release it when he was supposed to, Sons, we got mad at him.
[01:57:03.827 --> 01:57:07.148]  That's true, but here's the small print.
[01:57:07.148 --> 01:57:17.573]  When he did not release it on October 2nd, he said, according to Politico, that there would be weekly releases for the next 10 weeks, and that all of the U.S.
[01:57:17.573 --> 01:57:23.256]  election-related material would be released in the weeks before the election.
[01:57:23.256 --> 01:57:25.777]  The Washington Post reported that as, quote,
[01:57:26.337 --> 01:57:31.619]  Assange made vague predictions about future releases.
[01:57:31.619 --> 01:57:34.301]  So nothing I told the DNA wasn't public.
[01:57:34.301 --> 01:57:40.323]  Ride shotgun with me, but let's do five more minutes on who you blame in the Republican Party if we lose this.
[01:57:40.323 --> 01:57:47.487]  Because it's not about blame, it's about seeing where they failed and let the Democrats engage in fraud.
[01:57:47.487 --> 01:57:49.828]  Infowars Life is launching its newest product.
[01:57:49.828 --> 01:57:51.969]  We're really, really proud of it.

[01:58:38.809 --> 01:58:42.113]  We sold it at 50% off till it sold out.
[01:58:42.113 --> 01:58:44.656]  And I think it's going to be the same way with this fiber.

[01:59:51.232 --> 01:59:53.894]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:59:58.066 --> 02:00:04.072]  When I was summoned from Montgomery, I had my guitar on my back.
[02:00:04.072 --> 02:00:08.796]  When a stranger stopped beside me in an antique Cadillac.
[02:00:08.796 --> 02:00:14.362]  He was dressed like 1950, half drunk and hollow-eyed.
[02:00:14.362 --> 02:00:18.246]  He said, it's a long walk to Nashville, would you like to ride?
[02:00:19.139 --> 02:00:21.761]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:00:21.761 --> 02:00:26.864]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the Infowar.
[02:00:26.864 --> 02:00:29.266]  You know, as you said, Roger,
[02:00:42.293 --> 02:00:45.878]  The president needs to take action a year ago on the censorship.
[02:00:45.878 --> 02:00:47.079]  Now it's just rampant.
[02:00:47.079 --> 02:00:48.341]  But I understand he can't do everything.
[02:00:48.341 --> 02:00:49.562]  He's not perfect.
[02:00:49.562 --> 02:00:59.755]  But since you brought it up, here's a clip of him just yesterday talking to Axios for HBO, saying they're looking at going after them, big tech for antitrust violations.
[02:01:00.759 --> 02:01:03.121]  So we want to talk about what's been happening on social media.
[02:01:03.121 --> 02:01:07.445]  A lot of people questioning whether or not these companies are getting too big, too fast.
[02:01:07.445 --> 02:01:09.026]  Your Facebooks, your Amazons.
[02:01:09.026 --> 02:01:14.630]  Have you put thought into how Amazon and Facebook specifically should be regulated?
[02:01:14.630 --> 02:01:21.296]  You look at the European Union, they find, I guess it was Google, billions of dollars.
[02:01:21.296 --> 02:01:25.179]  And frankly, I don't like that they're doing that, because that's an American company.
[02:01:25.179 --> 02:01:27.001]  I don't think it's good that they're doing that.
[02:01:27.001 --> 02:01:29.323]  But if anybody does that, that should be us doing it.
[02:01:30.023 --> 02:01:31.944]  That shouldn't be the European Union.
[02:01:31.944 --> 02:01:33.524]  Do you think you'll regulate in the first term?
[02:01:33.524 --> 02:01:39.126]  You know, you get into the whole thing with freedom of speech, and what do you think, and... But what about monopoly?
[02:01:39.126 --> 02:01:47.329]  What about saying the Justice Department... Well, you do, you know, I have so many people saying that, but it's certainly something that we have looked at... Would you ever break them up?
[02:01:47.329 --> 02:01:54.511]  They were talking about this years ago, you know, they were actually talking about this same subject, monopoly, years ago, long before
[02:01:55.231 --> 02:01:55.712]  I was in office.
[02:01:55.712 --> 02:01:57.053]  Do you think you were the man to do it?
[02:01:57.053 --> 02:02:02.200]  In fact, a lot of people thought it was going to happen, and then I guess a previous administration stopped it from happening.
[02:02:02.200 --> 02:02:03.581]  But you're in charge now?
[02:02:03.581 --> 02:02:04.242]  I am in charge.
[02:02:04.242 --> 02:02:06.845]  I am definitely in charge, and we are certainly looking at it.
[02:02:06.845 --> 02:02:08.527]  This is antitrust?
[02:02:08.527 --> 02:02:09.268]  Antitrust, yes.
[02:02:09.268 --> 02:02:09.749]  Right.
[02:02:09.749 --> 02:02:10.950]  For Amazon?
[02:02:10.950 --> 02:02:12.632]  For all three.
[02:02:14.130 --> 02:02:15.311]  Now let me just stop.
[02:02:15.311 --> 02:02:20.753]  I personally, working with law firms and with Mike Adams and other groups, wrote three briefs that we got to the President.
[02:02:20.753 --> 02:02:28.958]  And I made the point, Mr. President, I'm all about not regulating, but the EU and others are already coming in with regulation because there's a vacuum.
[02:02:28.958 --> 02:02:32.920]  Because we're not regulating, they're bringing in the demands of censorship and control.
[02:02:32.920 --> 02:02:36.642]  And it's a cartel decision, so it's an antitrust decision.
[02:02:36.642 --> 02:02:40.544]  It's not a free speech issue because they're working in conjunction from outside pressure.
[02:02:41.224 --> 02:02:46.047]  And I was told the President specifically called in his lawyers and said that made perfect sense.
[02:02:46.047 --> 02:02:48.049]  That was three months ago, two months ago.
[02:02:48.049 --> 02:02:51.451]  To see it bearing fruit now right there is very, very exciting.
[02:02:51.451 --> 02:02:55.133]  Because here's the deal, all the other lawyers are scared to do this themselves in D.C.
[02:02:55.133 --> 02:03:01.938]  So I went out, spent the money, got the groups together, had the listeners hammer the White House with it, but also got it hand-delivered to him.
[02:03:01.938 --> 02:03:10.664]  So I gotta say, another big win, another big, fat, juicy torpedo that we have gotten to the President that he now is about to fire at the enemy.
[02:03:11.645 --> 02:03:13.506]  I think he gets it, Alex.
[02:03:13.506 --> 02:03:15.668]  I think in his heart he understands the issue.
[02:03:15.668 --> 02:03:19.691]  The question he's got is that he has an unresponsive Justice Department.
[02:03:19.691 --> 02:03:23.894]  This is also true in the area of voter security.
[02:03:23.894 --> 02:03:31.300]  I really fear massive fraud tomorrow because the Justice Department in this administration has done nothing to secure an honest vote.
[02:03:31.300 --> 02:03:35.123]  We're going to have widespread voter fraud in states like California and New York.
[02:03:36.223 --> 02:03:45.590]  I spoke to a New York police officer this morning, NYPD, who says the number of illegals voting in New York in his precinct are beyond belief.
[02:03:45.590 --> 02:03:49.053]  He knows because he works with ICE rounding them up.
[02:03:49.053 --> 02:03:50.654]  That's what he does.
[02:03:50.654 --> 02:03:54.177]  So you have massive voter fraud going on across the country.
[02:03:54.177 --> 02:03:55.458]  You've got to come back.
[02:03:55.458 --> 02:04:03.223]  You've got to stay then because we've got the head of Breitbart Texas on right now and I want you to talk about this because we have all the famous videos of Veritas.
[02:04:04.424 --> 02:04:13.372]  And they're there, you know, showing the heads of New York voting operations saying, oh, we load the illegals and homeless up, we have them all vote ten times apiece.
[02:04:13.372 --> 02:04:15.474]  Yeah, it happens regularly in New York State.
[02:04:15.474 --> 02:04:20.378]  So when Andrew Cuomo wins big tonight, don't think that that's a mandate, because it's not.
[02:04:20.378 --> 02:04:22.599]  It's the result of massive voter fraud.
[02:04:23.340 --> 02:04:25.081]  We'll stay there for the rest of the hour.
[02:04:25.081 --> 02:04:25.882]  I've got Chuck in with us.
[02:04:25.882 --> 02:04:29.164]  We have the head of Breitbart, Texas joining us coming up.
[02:04:29.164 --> 02:04:30.945]  Brandon Darby in just 60 seconds.
[02:04:30.945 --> 02:04:33.287]  Folks, we have a huge audience.
[02:04:33.287 --> 02:04:33.547]  You.
[02:04:33.547 --> 02:04:34.227]  You're wonderful.
[02:04:34.227 --> 02:04:36.989]  You're the heart and soul and blood of this country and the world.
[02:04:36.989 --> 02:04:46.635]  But without you spreading the links to InfoWars.com forward slash show and the link on the main page of InfoWars, watch our live election coverage, the video links, the audio links won't get out to people.
[02:04:46.635 --> 02:04:47.536]  Send it out to everybody.
[02:04:47.536 --> 02:04:48.837]  Text message it, please.
[02:04:48.837 --> 02:04:50.158]  Call friends and family and say watch
[02:04:56.120 --> 02:05:05.404]  The globalists know that if they suppress the good halogen and pump the environment full of the bad halogens, fluoride, chlorine, bromine, you name it, that it lowers IQ.
[02:05:05.404 --> 02:05:08.285]  It literally dumbs the population down.
[02:05:08.285 --> 02:05:14.307]  And on our quest to bring our listeners and viewers the best eye out of the world, we've gone through two permutations.
[02:05:14.987 --> 02:05:21.252]  First, seaweed-based iodine that was pretty good but hard to source, and the Globels tried to block us getting a supply of it.
[02:05:21.252 --> 02:05:27.558]  So we discovered deep-earth crystals of pure nascent iodine and brought you X2 that's been incredible.
[02:05:27.558 --> 02:05:34.583]  Now, due to the establishment trying to block that, we did more research and secured more of the deep-earth crystals of nascent iodine.
[02:05:34.583 --> 02:05:34.784]  But!
[02:05:35.624 --> 02:05:48.652]  Chemists, scientists, and others showed us the research that by combining it with three other compounds, two forms of iodine and vitamin C, it supercharges it and makes it even more bioavailable.
[02:05:48.652 --> 02:05:52.894]  Ladies and gentlemen, you want to research it, you want to see it, it's an incredible discovery.
[02:05:52.894 --> 02:05:54.835]  X3, now available at m4slife.com.
[02:06:07.367 --> 02:06:11.730]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:06:11.730 --> 02:06:14.091]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[02:06:29.116 --> 02:06:32.119]  We are broadcasting worldwide already into the third hour.
[02:06:32.119 --> 02:06:34.361]  We're going till midnight tonight with live coverage.
[02:06:34.361 --> 02:06:40.908]  Roger Stone with us as he was two years ago on the eve of the election and the night of the election.
[02:06:40.908 --> 02:06:45.412]  He'll be with us right through tomorrow night with 24-hour live coverage right through the evening.
[02:06:45.412 --> 02:06:48.135]  He's riding shotgun with us right now.
[02:06:48.135 --> 02:06:51.958]  Now, Brandon Darby, I want to get him in studio sometime because he's a fellow Texan for a full hour.
[02:06:52.938 --> 02:06:54.739]  Because, I mean, I'll admit something.
[02:06:54.739 --> 02:07:02.603]  It was like 10 years ago, I have writers here that are no longer here, and one of them wrote an article about Mr. Darby, which I later learned was not true.
[02:07:02.603 --> 02:07:08.046]  It was actually an article like defending Antifa from the Infowars perspective.
[02:07:08.046 --> 02:07:09.186]  Boy, I gotta tell you.
[02:07:09.186 --> 02:07:11.287]  And that's just a side note.
[02:07:11.287 --> 02:07:13.008]  Mr. Darby's been demonized by the left.
[02:07:13.008 --> 02:07:14.649]  They've made false documentaries about him.
[02:07:15.409 --> 02:07:18.130]  You name it, and now I've got to experience that myself.
[02:07:18.130 --> 02:07:24.572]  So I've apologized before without him on the air, but I apologize for getting things wrong a decade ago, but now we're getting them right.
[02:07:24.572 --> 02:07:26.832]  Brandon Darby at Breitbart.com.
[02:07:26.832 --> 02:07:32.554]  He is their Texas editor, Texas head, at Brandon Darby on Twitter, and he joins us
[02:07:33.194 --> 02:07:54.429]  Really, to give us an update, spending much of his time on the Texas border, Arizona border, working with ICE, about the caravan, about Beto, and reportedly the Project Veritas information, but also just the level of MS-13 lawlessness and how dangerous this is, and how crazy it is to see Nancy Pelosi and others call them all God's children, and why is the left allying
[02:07:55.029 --> 02:07:58.911]  With not just illegals, but the most criminal types out there.
[02:07:58.911 --> 02:08:07.877]  And as Roger Stone just added, if you just joined us, listeners and viewers, where Brandon missed it five minutes ago, he was talking to an NYPD detective that he knows quite well that works with ICE.
[02:08:07.877 --> 02:08:10.998]  He said, listen, I've never seen so many illegal aliens voting.
[02:08:10.998 --> 02:08:13.780]  And of course, Project Veritas exposed all that with undercover videos.
[02:08:13.780 --> 02:08:18.142]  So, Brandon, you're really the expert in the two segments we have, so you can lead us here.
[02:08:18.142 --> 02:08:20.744]  Where do you want to start on the real situation on the border?
[02:08:20.744 --> 02:08:22.245]  Because you're one of the leading experts.
[02:08:23.834 --> 02:08:29.360]  First off, Alex, thank you for having me on and thank you for what you said while I wasn't on.
[02:08:29.360 --> 02:08:32.464]  That meant a lot to me.
[02:08:32.464 --> 02:08:34.987]  Like most things in the world, everything is complex.
[02:08:34.987 --> 02:08:35.347]  There's nuance.
[02:08:37.481 --> 02:08:42.464]  There's complexity to everything, and the border is the same exact way.
[02:08:42.464 --> 02:08:46.346]  You know, we have a southwest border that's made up of nine sectors, right?
[02:08:46.346 --> 02:08:47.006]  That's the U.S.
[02:08:47.006 --> 02:08:51.929]  border with Mexico, and all of those nine sectors are dealing with something very different.
[02:08:51.929 --> 02:08:55.211]  Some of those sectors have multiple things they're dealing with.
[02:08:55.211 --> 02:08:57.412]  You know, every 40 miles is different, right?
[02:08:57.412 --> 02:09:04.356]  And what the border patrols just deal with, and what the Mexican cartels are trying to do, and the way that the Mexican cartels operate.
[02:09:04.836 --> 02:09:07.760]  So we, in Texas, we have several sectors.
[02:09:07.760 --> 02:09:13.087]  We have the Rio Grande Valley sector, the Laredo sector, and the Del Rio sector.
[02:09:13.087 --> 02:09:16.911]  That's all the ones against the coast, right, going from east to west.
[02:09:16.911 --> 02:09:19.435]  And we're dealing with Los Zetas and the Gulf cartel.
[02:09:19.995 --> 02:09:28.364]  And those are really the most brutal cartels along the border, across the entire US-Mexico border because of the way that they do business.
[02:09:28.364 --> 02:09:38.255]  So it's very important and it's very good that you're having your listeners, that you're talking about this and that you're bringing me on to talk about it because we really do have threats, not only to us,
[02:09:38.795 --> 02:09:49.859]  But even, you know, liberals who are constantly worried about the migrants and constantly worried about Mexico, well it turns out what's currently happening not only doesn't hurt us, but it also hurts Mexico.
[02:09:49.859 --> 02:09:52.100]  We're perpetuating the oppression.
[02:09:52.100 --> 02:09:58.042]  We're perpetuating the very systems that people are trying to get away from in the first place by allowing this to continue.
[02:09:59.842 --> 02:10:00.463]  Break that down.
[02:10:00.463 --> 02:10:07.573]  Is it allowing the lawlessness that goes back and forth from Central America to North America into the U.S.?
[02:10:07.573 --> 02:10:10.678]  I mean, is that what allows Mexico to stay so failed?
[02:10:11.812 --> 02:10:12.733]  Well, here's what happens.
[02:10:12.733 --> 02:10:17.778]  So, in Mexico, you have organized criminal circles or networks, right?
[02:10:17.778 --> 02:10:24.564]  And the cartel, the drug dealing part, is just one small part of that criminal network.
[02:10:24.564 --> 02:10:35.395]  Well, that criminal network, in the case of Los Zetas and the Gulf Cartel, they make as much or more from illegal immigration than they make from narcotics.
[02:10:36.016 --> 02:10:44.324]  So they're actually you could make that you could call them drug cartels or you could call them illegal immigration cartel or migrant trafficking cartels.
[02:10:44.324 --> 02:10:48.849]  So what happens is these networks have power in Mexico.
[02:10:48.849 --> 02:10:53.553]  They have so much power that that they have someone who works in all of the news outlets.
[02:10:53.553 --> 02:10:56.436]  That person in the news outlet is called the link and that link.
[02:10:57.176 --> 02:11:17.350]  Tell them it works for the cartel and tell them what they can and can't write about which politicians they can support Which crimes they can write about which crimes they can't write about who to blame for those crimes So the media it's almost like you when we talk about governmental control or we talk about We look at the former Soviet Union, right?
[02:11:17.350 --> 02:11:24.614]  And they had the communist minders and all the news outlets and in all the media places That's what they live under they live under abject oppression.
[02:11:24.614 --> 02:11:26.736]  So anything that fuels and fun
[02:11:27.496 --> 02:11:32.378]  Those networks of people is in fact contributing to that oppression.
[02:11:32.378 --> 02:11:47.464]  And so when we allow, when we say, oh, this is horrible, this is happening, and we allow millions of people to come here, or tens of thousands each summer to come here, roughly 10,000 per week, 7 to 10,000 per week, all of those people
[02:11:50.745 --> 02:12:07.978]  If they don't have the money to pay Los Etos at the Gulf Cartel right away, they get into indentured servitude and they make agreements to keep paying those cartels every week or two through Orlando Voluta or through Western Union, but they keep paying those cartels money for 10 years.
[02:12:08.678 --> 02:12:14.560]  And then that gives the cartels a beachhead here, and I'm not a rocket scientist on this, but if Soros and the U.N.
[02:12:14.560 --> 02:12:23.983]  can open up Latin America and crush the Mexican border, we won't just have a Mexican problem of illegals and drugs and human smuggling and these people being in district service.
[02:12:23.983 --> 02:12:33.526]  Now it'll be ten times bigger and can all be managed and controlled, and then we'll build even bigger cartel bases inside El Norte.
[02:12:33.526 --> 02:12:37.447]  Well, so we have a major problem, and the problem is that
[02:12:38.242 --> 02:12:41.588]  Basically, it sucks to live in Mexico, in parts of Mexico.
[02:12:41.588 --> 02:12:44.954]  It definitely sucks to live in most of Central America.
[02:12:44.954 --> 02:12:46.536]  That's called the push factor, right?
[02:12:46.536 --> 02:12:48.720]  So that pushes people away from those regions.
[02:12:48.720 --> 02:12:49.422]  They want to leave.
[02:12:50.063 --> 02:12:53.666]  And it's our policies that create what are called pull factors.
[02:12:53.666 --> 02:12:58.250]  So our policies, if it sucks to live there, that's pushing them away.
[02:12:58.250 --> 02:13:07.977]  And then if we have policies that allow people to stay, that pull factor pulls them and it creates, I guess it finishes the circle.
[02:13:07.977 --> 02:13:10.159]  It allows people to come here.
[02:13:10.159 --> 02:13:11.680]  A chain reaction!
[02:13:11.680 --> 02:13:12.561]  A chain reaction!
[02:13:13.601 --> 02:13:14.842]  Absolute chain reaction.
[02:13:14.842 --> 02:13:31.290]  And so there's a good humanitarian argument to be made for border security, and no one's really making that argument, which is really stupid, because the truth is, is that what we're perpetuating, we're perpetuating a situation, I mean, think about, you focus on liberty, you think about freedom.
[02:13:31.810 --> 02:13:48.388]  If everyone in Central America or parts of Mexico who want something better, who have that drive to have better and to have a better life for them and their family, if all of those people are allowed to come here, who is left to change and have revolution and change things in their nations of birth?
[02:13:48.388 --> 02:13:49.710]  Nobody's left there.
[02:13:49.710 --> 02:13:51.472]  And so it perpetuates the problem.
[02:13:52.645 --> 02:14:02.992]  Well, I don't think I've heard anybody encapsulate it in seven minutes as good as you just did, and I mean that's why I wanted to keep you on the show, because I see you on national TV, I see you on Breitbart, I see you on our other shows.
[02:14:02.992 --> 02:14:04.273]  Why is Soros in the UN?
[02:14:04.273 --> 02:14:06.334]  Because they're admittedly involved.
[02:14:06.334 --> 02:14:11.598]  Why are the leftists and the Democrats so involved in, like I said, Pelosi and others even praising MS-13?
[02:14:14.474 --> 02:14:19.797]  Well, I think that we're in a situation right now, and this is where we probably differ a little bit.
[02:14:19.797 --> 02:14:32.004]  Like, I do think that Soros-funded groups contribute to this, just like I think that the Catholic Church contributes to it, and so do Evangelical or Protestant churches in a lot of ways.
[02:14:32.004 --> 02:14:38.048]  I think that, for the most part, I think the average person on the left actually thinks they're helping.
[02:14:38.763 --> 02:14:41.223]  The world, and I think that they're wrong.
[02:14:41.223 --> 02:14:42.704]  You know, I think that that's the problem.
[02:14:42.704 --> 02:14:45.584]  I think that they don't have enough information.
[02:14:45.584 --> 02:14:53.686]  When the media, you know, this is a situation that you're in, and Breitbart's into it to a lesser extent right now, but it's still going through it.
[02:14:53.686 --> 02:15:04.868]  When mainstream media outlets and legacy media outlets control all of the news, and they control what information people are exposed to, and then people who are trying to
[02:15:06.284 --> 02:15:06.905]  We're good to go.
[02:15:29.500 --> 02:15:30.141]  Oh, let me be clear.
[02:15:30.141 --> 02:15:32.262]  I totally agree that most of the liberals mean well.
[02:15:32.262 --> 02:15:33.383]  I totally agree with you.
[02:15:33.383 --> 02:15:34.584]  I think you're right.
[02:15:34.584 --> 02:15:37.587]  And that's why they're so scared of Brandon Darby, because he used to be a liberal.
[02:15:37.587 --> 02:15:41.049]  Then he saw how bad some of them were, and he turned against them, so he's a big enemy.
[02:15:41.049 --> 02:15:44.852]  And then, of course, I watched their films and believed it, which shows I could be a moron.
[02:15:44.852 --> 02:15:45.713]  We'll be right back.
[02:15:45.713 --> 02:15:47.154]  Roger Stone's going to chime in as well.
[02:15:47.154 --> 02:15:48.735]  Brandon Darby straight ahead.
[02:15:48.735 --> 02:15:49.976]  It's live election coverage.
[02:15:49.976 --> 02:15:53.039]  We have one of the top border experts on with us right now.
[02:15:53.039 --> 02:15:54.020]  Brandon Darby from Breitbart.
[02:15:55.089 --> 02:15:57.710]  Hunters, anglers, campers and survivalists.
[02:15:57.710 --> 02:15:58.810]  Get back to nature.

[02:16:25.018 --> 02:16:28.640]  What if there was a social media network only for the conservative?
[02:16:28.640 --> 02:16:36.002]  What if there was a social media network not only for the conservative right general public, but also a platform for conservative politicians and advertisers?
[02:16:36.002 --> 02:16:40.904]  And what if this social media network was the only free speech network in existence?
[02:16:40.904 --> 02:16:41.745]  There is.
[02:16:41.745 --> 02:16:43.325]  It's RightSocial.net.
[02:16:43.325 --> 02:16:44.686]  RightSocial.net.
[02:16:44.686 --> 02:16:48.007]  A response to President Donald Trump's direct presidential order.
[02:16:48.007 --> 02:16:49.308]  RightSocial.net.
[02:16:49.308 --> 02:16:51.529]  Where you have the right to freely speak your mind.
[02:16:51.529 --> 02:16:52.869]  RightSocial.net.
[02:16:52.869 --> 02:16:54.130]  The right place to be.
[02:16:54.961 --> 02:16:59.762]  In these uncertain times, it makes sense to have a sustainable backup method to cook food and boil water.
[02:16:59.762 --> 02:17:05.644]  If your current plan includes using a fuel-burning stove or cooking over an open fire, then there's a much better way.
[02:17:05.644 --> 02:17:12.145]  The Minuteman Rocket Stove is a biomass-burning cooking stove that only requires small quantities of sticks and twigs for fuel.
[02:17:12.145 --> 02:17:16.186]  The Minuteman Stove is easy to use, smokeless, portable, powerful, and sustainable.
[02:17:16.186 --> 02:17:22.448]  For the finest in survival cooking stoves and fire starters made right here in the USA, go to MinutemanStove.com.
[02:17:22.448 --> 02:17:24.208]  That's MinutemanStove.com.
[02:17:25.259 --> 02:17:26.459]  Hear that?
[02:17:26.459 --> 02:17:31.841]  That's the sound of a house being trashed while a gang of thieves ransack the place.
[02:17:31.841 --> 02:17:34.741]  And what they don't steal will be destroyed.
[02:17:34.741 --> 02:17:38.322]  This year, resolve not to be the next victim of a break-in.
[02:17:38.322 --> 02:17:45.884]  Go to Faketv.com and discover a device that creates the illusion someone inside is watching TV, even when you're miles away.
[02:17:45.884 --> 02:17:50.485]  Security is a mindset, and Faketv should be part of your security solution.
[02:17:50.485 --> 02:17:52.906]  Be vigilant, but not fearful.
[02:17:52.906 --> 02:17:54.086]  Faketv.com
[02:17:56.300 --> 02:18:00.584]  Please, whatever you do, realize that we're all getting punched drunk to the censorship.
[02:18:00.584 --> 02:18:04.047]  And you saw 18 Twitter accounts, they say, affiliated with InfoWars.
[02:18:04.047 --> 02:18:05.809]  Yeah, some of them are like little side accounts.
[02:18:05.809 --> 02:18:09.212]  They know we had like InfoWars store that just showed our products.
[02:18:09.212 --> 02:18:15.878]  They just banned them all yesterday in punishment that I be at a Trump rally and be mobbed by all these folks that loved us.
[02:18:15.878 --> 02:18:20.943]  Your excitement about America, your excitement about this broadcast is what brought the country and the world back from the brick.
[02:18:21.283 --> 02:18:27.405]  But the globalists now want to target where the resistance came from, so that we're not pesky in the future.
[02:18:27.405 --> 02:18:30.366]  I want to be troublesome and pesky.
[02:18:30.366 --> 02:18:31.467]  I want to keep going.
[02:18:31.467 --> 02:18:35.288]  I want to make them do the ultimate, not just destroy us financially.
[02:18:35.288 --> 02:18:37.309]  I want to push all the way.
[02:18:37.309 --> 02:18:38.609]  I've committed to do that.
[02:18:38.609 --> 02:18:39.690]  I've prayed for that.
[02:18:39.690 --> 02:18:41.330]  And I've been told that's going to happen.
[02:18:41.330 --> 02:18:44.251]  But you've got to back us, and I promise you this.
[02:18:44.251 --> 02:18:45.572]  I will never falter.
[02:18:45.572 --> 02:18:47.893]  I will never waver at the spiritual level.
[02:18:47.893 --> 02:18:48.573]  I physically will.
[02:18:49.153 --> 02:18:55.959]  But I give you my commitment, if you financially support us, at FullRestore.com, to give you my absolute, total commitment.
[02:18:55.959 --> 02:19:04.345]  It's really hard to have the energy at the end of the day to still get to the gym, or to go for a run, or go to the park, or heck, even take your dog for a walk.
[02:19:04.345 --> 02:19:04.806]  Believe me.
[02:19:05.166 --> 02:19:05.786]  I know.
[02:19:05.786 --> 02:19:10.489]  I spend hours in front of a screen and then hours in front of bright lights every day.
[02:19:10.489 --> 02:19:15.752]  But thanks to super male vitality at Infowarstore.com, I still have that energy.
[02:19:15.752 --> 02:19:29.959]  There's no way I could have the energy at the end of a long day to fight back against the chemicals in the food and water, to fight back against the modern day lifestyle with the screen time and the extended hours, to still have the stamina and endurance, energy and drive
[02:19:30.339 --> 02:19:36.401]  To get to the gym, get to the park, and get exercise that you need for your health.
[02:19:36.401 --> 02:19:40.383]  So go to Infowarsstore.com and get Supermail Vitality before it's gone.
[02:19:40.383 --> 02:19:44.064]  This is actually our last run of Supermail Vitality.
[02:19:44.064 --> 02:19:49.046]  So I want you to experience Supermail Vitality before it's too late.
[02:19:49.046 --> 02:19:51.787]  Unleash the Supermail in you.
[02:19:51.787 --> 02:19:54.248]  Supermail Vitality from Infowarsstore.com.
[02:19:59.218 --> 02:20:01.803]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:20:22.535 --> 02:20:24.276]  The Alex Jones Show.
[02:20:24.276 --> 02:20:26.497]  Because there is a war on.
[02:20:26.497 --> 02:20:27.577]  Or you're mine.
[02:20:27.577 --> 02:20:35.661]  This is live, continual coverage, but I've been trying to get Brandon Darby on for like a month, and I was glad he wanted to come on a few weeks ago, right before the election, because this is one of the biggest issues.
[02:20:35.661 --> 02:20:37.882]  And I think Trump's right to make it a big issue.
[02:20:37.882 --> 02:20:40.643]  You've got Latin America, 800 million people wanting to come up here.
[02:20:40.643 --> 02:20:47.546]  It's been turned into a huge business by cartels, the different aid agencies, once they get here and make money out of them, Roger.
[02:20:47.546 --> 02:20:50.447]  But I gotta ask you a question, Brandon Darby.
[02:20:50.447 --> 02:20:51.248]  I wanna ask you, how...
[02:20:52.395 --> 02:20:59.658]  How long do you think this problem is going to be allowed to continue to go on, and can it even be fixed?
[02:20:59.658 --> 02:21:01.739]  Well, yeah, can it be fixed?
[02:21:01.739 --> 02:21:04.120]  Let's talk about the ways to fight back.
[02:21:04.120 --> 02:21:05.141]  So here's what we do.
[02:21:06.121 --> 02:21:13.924]  What we do is I spend about 10 days a month, I have for the last five or six years, on the border, traveling all nine sectors.
[02:21:13.924 --> 02:21:15.024]  I go into Mexico.
[02:21:15.024 --> 02:21:19.465]  Sometimes I have to sneak into Mexico because some areas are that controlled.
[02:21:19.465 --> 02:21:28.828]  Some areas, you know, when you hear about journalists being murdered, there's been I think 17 journalists this year, just in 2018, murdered in Mexico for reporting on cartels.
[02:21:28.828 --> 02:21:29.689]  It's very dangerous.
[02:21:31.349 --> 02:21:48.723]  But what we do is we go and we allow journalists there and cops there and others there who care, we allow them to write under a pseudonym and to share photos and to write about the corruption, to write about who's doing what, and we publish that in English and Spanish.
[02:21:48.723 --> 02:21:50.485]  That's our Cartel Chronicles project.
[02:21:50.905 --> 02:21:56.448]  So we focus on one cartel boss at a time and we write about them so much that it makes the U.S.
[02:21:56.448 --> 02:22:06.692]  State Department embarrassed and it makes the Mexican government embarrassed and then they go after that cartel boss and we effectively take them out by bringing attention and shining a spotlight on them.
[02:22:06.692 --> 02:22:11.654]  That is the responsible way to change this and that's the responsible way to go about it.
[02:22:11.654 --> 02:22:15.296]  I see a lot of people talking about going down there with guns to stop it.
[02:22:15.296 --> 02:22:19.958]  That's just going to make the work of Border Patrol agents a lot more complicated.
[02:22:19.958 --> 02:22:20.098]  I agree.
[02:22:20.638 --> 02:22:23.919]  I strongly suggest people don't do that.
[02:22:23.919 --> 02:22:39.642]  And what I do suggest people do is share our stories, talk about our stories, get to know these cartel bosses by name, pressure the State Department, pressure your politicians to bring it up, pressure people with platforms like you to bring it up, and people like me to bring it up.
[02:22:39.642 --> 02:22:43.183]  Because the more we write about them, they have to go after them.
[02:22:43.183 --> 02:22:46.324]  They did it with Toro and Reynosa in McAllen, Texas.
[02:22:47.084 --> 02:22:49.166]  We did it in Michoacán.
[02:22:49.166 --> 02:22:51.307]  There was a cartel there.
[02:22:51.307 --> 02:22:54.149]  The Mexican military was in there to look for the cartel boss.
[02:22:54.149 --> 02:22:55.270]  They never could find him.
[02:22:55.270 --> 02:23:01.233]  And then we published photos showing the military commander hanging out with the cartel boss fraternizing with him.
[02:23:01.233 --> 02:23:06.617]  As soon as we did that, a week later, they caught that cartel boss.
[02:23:06.617 --> 02:23:12.681]  That's how we can effectively challenge that system, like the same way that the United States and Americans
[02:23:13.261 --> 02:23:13.641]  We're good.
[02:23:32.449 --> 02:23:35.091]  Focus on these cartel bosses and take them out.
[02:23:35.091 --> 02:23:36.992]  And that's what we're doing with our Cartel Chronicles.
[02:23:36.992 --> 02:23:40.295]  I strongly suggest everybody checks it out.
[02:23:40.295 --> 02:23:45.999]  These are stories written by people in Mexico under a pseudonym, and they're really good.
[02:23:45.999 --> 02:23:54.726]  Some of the images are hard to take, they're hard to stomach, don't look at them when you're eating because they're gross, like violent images, but it's the reality of what's occurring on our border.
[02:23:55.436 --> 02:23:57.638]  And again, it's the spotlight they fear.
[02:23:57.638 --> 02:24:00.720]  Our mainstream media won't do this because they're afraid.
[02:24:00.720 --> 02:24:08.746]  And that's why when I said Brandon Darby, who I really respect in the last six, seven years, watching the actual work he did, then I saw what the leftist media had said about him for no reason.
[02:24:08.746 --> 02:24:14.591]  It made me really angry because nobody, nobody else consistently is doing what Brandon Darby does.
[02:24:15.111 --> 02:24:27.859]  With his team down there and what Breitbart does, when you see Breitbart being censored and attacked and lied about, when it's doing some of the best journalistic work in the world, just like Project Veritas, it makes me physically sick and angry.
[02:24:27.859 --> 02:24:34.243]  And exactly, it's like an authoritarian regime down there in these sectors that are under cartel control.
[02:24:34.243 --> 02:24:40.868]  And so this is America giving a voice to these dissident journalists and is really bringing sunshine to the situation, Roger.
[02:24:41.408 --> 02:24:57.375]  Look, Alex, I think we all understand, had Donald Trump not been elected, the master plan was to have the next Democratic president, Hillary Clinton, wave a wand, legalize all of the illegals, and have a permanent Democratic majority that could never be thwarted.
[02:24:57.995 --> 02:25:00.717]  Unfortunately for them, Donald Trump won.
[02:25:00.717 --> 02:25:04.561]  Now they are flooding us with illegal voters.
[02:25:04.561 --> 02:25:08.103]  The caravan is knocking on our door.
[02:25:08.103 --> 02:25:13.588]  I think the president has been very effective in the use of this issue.
[02:25:13.588 --> 02:25:18.292]  But the question really boils down to whether we can thwart their master plan.
[02:25:18.292 --> 02:25:20.874]  We need to build the wall.
[02:25:20.874 --> 02:25:22.295]  Let me ask Brandon Darby that.
[02:25:23.616 --> 02:25:27.560]  From your view, how has Trump made the fight different in the last two years?
[02:25:27.560 --> 02:25:28.461]  Better or worse?
[02:25:28.461 --> 02:25:30.743]  I know you'll be honest about it.
[02:25:30.743 --> 02:25:32.764]  Well, I think, okay, there's a couple of things.
[02:25:32.764 --> 02:25:38.890]  But first off, a lot of this really doesn't have to do with Trump or anyone in the White House.
[02:25:38.890 --> 02:25:41.132]  And what it has to do with is our policy.
[02:25:42.828 --> 02:25:46.329]  If we have a wall and it's built 40 yards into the U.S.
[02:25:46.329 --> 02:26:06.053]  territory, okay, which is where it is, 40 to 100 yards, most of it, and most of the existing fencing and the ones that Trump has authorized, if the policy is all they have to do is set foot on our soil and claim and ask for asylum, the wall doesn't do anything because they're already on our soil.
[02:26:06.938 --> 02:26:13.224]  You've got to get rid of birthright citizenship, you've got to get rid of anchor babies, and you've got to get rid of just, you get here, you get asylum.
[02:26:14.353 --> 02:26:16.695]  But a lot of it, yes, it's about policy.
[02:26:16.695 --> 02:26:19.656]  And not only is it about policy, but there's another thing.
[02:26:19.656 --> 02:26:21.237]  It's about our tone, right?
[02:26:21.237 --> 02:26:31.243]  The simple fact is the majority of people in Mexico and the majority of people along the border who are from Mexico, who are living in this country, they are natural conservatives.
[02:26:31.243 --> 02:26:32.304]  It's the weirdest thing.
[02:26:32.304 --> 02:26:36.467]  They will vote Democrats because of the way the Democrats pander to them.
[02:26:36.467 --> 02:26:38.428]  They believe in family.
[02:26:38.428 --> 02:26:41.089]  They believe that the man is the head of the family.
[02:26:41.089 --> 02:26:43.571]  They respect their fathers and their mothers.
[02:26:44.905 --> 02:26:46.806]  They don't like abortion.
[02:26:46.806 --> 02:26:49.209]  That's why they didn't vote for Wendy Davis.
[02:26:49.209 --> 02:26:54.894]  If you look at when Wendy Davis ran, she lost most of the border regions that were full of Mexican-Americans.
[02:26:54.894 --> 02:26:55.234]  Why?
[02:26:55.234 --> 02:26:57.716]  Because she was too lefty, too out there for it.
[02:26:57.716 --> 02:27:00.278]  Well, she loved abortion, and people are like, that's evil.
[02:27:01.246 --> 02:27:01.866]  No, I agree.
[02:27:01.866 --> 02:27:05.689]  We have to have it where if you're really a Mexican and you want to go back and forth, that's fine.
[02:27:05.689 --> 02:27:07.110]  We ought to make it as long as it's legal and lawful.
[02:27:07.110 --> 02:27:08.071]  You can go back and forth.
[02:27:08.071 --> 02:27:08.911]  We all should be able to.
[02:27:08.911 --> 02:27:16.336]  But if you're coming in, you're a criminal, you're from Central America, you're part of some globalist operation, you don't get in.
[02:27:16.336 --> 02:27:19.638]  Well, so the bottom line, though, is that it's about tone.
[02:27:19.638 --> 02:27:23.881]  So I like that Donald Trump, like the Border Patrol agents, feel inspired.
[02:27:23.881 --> 02:27:27.763]  They have a higher morale than they had under Obama, obviously.
[02:27:27.763 --> 02:27:28.424]  That's awesome.
[02:27:29.443 --> 02:27:29.743]  I think.
[02:27:49.111 --> 02:27:53.917]  I agree with the policies, but I wish you would talk... It's about our tone.
[02:27:53.917 --> 02:28:01.706]  So we can realize that there are good people there trying to better their country, and that most of the people coming here really aren't criminals.
[02:28:01.706 --> 02:28:02.487]  I understand that.
[02:28:02.487 --> 02:28:07.934]  I don't think we should let most of the people stay here or come here, but that most of them really are coming just to work.
[02:28:08.194 --> 02:28:11.855]  No, I agree, but then it creates the magnet to bring in the criminals that are with him.
[02:28:11.855 --> 02:28:13.256]  Brandon, promise you'll come back.
[02:28:13.256 --> 02:28:14.116]  It's our time.
[02:28:14.116 --> 02:28:16.097]  Promise you'll come back soon or even come in studio.
[02:28:16.097 --> 02:28:17.117]  Anytime.
[02:28:17.117 --> 02:28:17.617]  Anytime.
[02:28:17.617 --> 02:28:19.558]  You just let me know and I'll work that out.
[02:28:19.558 --> 02:28:21.299]  Again, how do people find your work?
[02:28:21.299 --> 02:28:23.740]  At Brandon Darby on Twitter and at Breitbart.com.
[02:28:23.740 --> 02:28:24.080]  How else?
[02:28:25.613 --> 02:28:29.874]  Just Google Cartel Chronicles and look at our stories.
[02:28:29.874 --> 02:28:31.015]  They'll blow you away.
[02:28:31.015 --> 02:28:31.995]  They'll blow you away.
[02:28:31.995 --> 02:28:37.457]  What's going on along our border, the media does not focus on it, and it does a big disservice.
[02:28:37.457 --> 02:28:41.258]  It keeps people from knowing the truth.
[02:28:41.258 --> 02:28:43.878]  Well, I don't think anybody's got their finger on the pulse like you.
[02:28:43.878 --> 02:28:45.859]  That's why I'm serious.
[02:28:45.859 --> 02:28:49.340]  So anytime you want to come in studio, too, when you're in Austin, we can do a whole presentation.
[02:28:49.340 --> 02:28:50.120]  Thank you so much.
[02:28:50.120 --> 02:28:50.701]  Thank you, Brandon.
[02:28:50.701 --> 02:28:51.761]  We'll be back with Roger Stone.
[02:28:55.000 --> 02:29:01.345]  The United States of Empire is a book that claims the United States is the empire of the world.
[02:29:01.345 --> 02:29:04.387]  George Washington had warned us against foreign wars.
[02:29:04.387 --> 02:29:09.951]  The United States of Empire shows that World Wars I and II left England broken.
[02:29:10.291 --> 02:29:14.095]  Its former colony, the U.S., had to save the empire.
[02:29:14.095 --> 02:29:15.356]  Was there ever a vote?
[02:29:15.356 --> 02:29:16.377]  Who do we fight for?
[02:29:16.377 --> 02:29:22.902]  The Deep State began with World War I. The United States of Empire by James Dunn.

[02:31:57.290 --> 02:32:02.933]  We need to go back and revisit the foundations of our freedom.
[02:32:02.933 --> 02:32:06.075]  Our freedoms don't consist of the things that are enumerated on a piece of paper.
[02:32:06.075 --> 02:32:08.737]  It consists of the things that we're willing to fight for.
[02:32:08.737 --> 02:32:13.039]  The First Amendment, the Bill of Rights, the rest of the Bill of Rights are prohibitions.
[02:32:13.039 --> 02:32:20.523]  They're prohibitions against powerful organizations and individuals taking those God-given rights from us as individuals.
[02:32:20.523 --> 02:32:22.965]  You better understand that because they're taking them right now.
[02:32:26.394 --> 02:32:28.596]  We have seen what they want to do.
[02:32:28.596 --> 02:32:29.577]  They called it U.N.
[02:32:29.577 --> 02:32:30.817]  Agenda 21, now they call it the U.N.
[02:32:30.817 --> 02:32:31.638]  2030 Agenda.
[02:32:31.638 --> 02:32:43.567]  They want everybody off of the rural lands, they want people out of the suburbs, they want to pack everybody into the cities, because that's where it is easiest for them to control everyone.
[02:32:43.567 --> 02:32:45.128]  It's the David Knight Show!
[02:32:45.128 --> 02:32:48.831]  Never miss your show, any day.
[02:32:48.831 --> 02:32:49.892]  I mean, what?
[02:32:49.892 --> 02:32:50.512]  I mean, never!
[02:32:59.152 --> 02:33:01.776]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:28.973 --> 02:33:33.716]  We now take you live to the eve of the midterm 2018 global election.
[02:33:33.716 --> 02:33:42.000]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance.
[02:33:42.000 --> 02:33:44.981]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[02:33:44.981 --> 02:33:53.146]  It is a referendum on nationalism versus globalism and I believed on the eve of the 2016 election that Trump would win when nobody else did, but
[02:33:54.065 --> 02:33:56.606]  I had a lot of indicators and evidence of why that was the case.
[02:33:56.606 --> 02:33:59.148]  And those indicators are still there.
[02:33:59.148 --> 02:34:00.348]  Fake polls.
[02:34:00.348 --> 02:34:01.589]  Massive Republican turnout.
[02:34:01.589 --> 02:34:03.570]  But we've seen massive Democrat turnout.
[02:34:03.570 --> 02:34:05.431]  Illegal aliens voting all over the country.
[02:34:05.431 --> 02:34:06.391]  Caught red-handed.
[02:34:06.391 --> 02:34:07.672]  Veritas documenting it.
[02:34:08.553 --> 02:34:10.614]  Undercover video showing it.
[02:34:10.614 --> 02:34:21.517]  Arrest all over the country of Democrats mailing out absentee ballots and early ballots to people's homes, then being filled out and delivered back and almost no coverage of it.
[02:34:21.517 --> 02:34:31.080]  Roger Stone, recap the predictions you've been making and then get into the shocking thing you told me earlier about the New York detective that's a good friend of yours that told you earlier today.
[02:34:31.400 --> 02:34:39.345]  You know, Alex, as I said earlier, I think if we had an honest election, Donald Trump and the Republicans would triumph again.
[02:34:39.345 --> 02:34:42.046]  But the difference is internet censorship.
[02:34:42.046 --> 02:34:50.472]  When you shift control of the entire political coverage and political narrative back to the mainstream media, when you shut down
[02:34:51.612 --> 02:35:09.326]  Access from all of these various pro-conservative, pro-Republican media outlets, when you take down millions of pages of Facebook followers, when you censor InfoWars, when you censor people on Reddit, they're controlling the political narrative.
[02:35:09.326 --> 02:35:10.507]  That's the difference.
[02:35:10.507 --> 02:35:13.089]  Now add to that massive voter fraud.
[02:35:13.969 --> 02:35:22.478]  Which is recurring even today and tomorrow in early voting and absentee battling, as well as tomorrow at the actual polls.
[02:35:22.478 --> 02:35:24.401]  And you have a recipe for disaster.
[02:35:24.401 --> 02:35:25.602]  That is my concern.
[02:35:25.602 --> 02:35:27.864]  It's not that we don't still have the numbers.
[02:35:27.864 --> 02:35:28.685]  We do.
[02:35:28.685 --> 02:35:31.168]  I don't think we're going to get an honest count.
[02:35:31.168 --> 02:35:32.009]  That's my concern.
[02:35:32.429 --> 02:35:41.677]  Now I spoke to a New York detective today, the NYPD, a guy whose specific job is tracking down illegals.
[02:35:41.677 --> 02:35:44.159]  Works very closely with ICE.
[02:35:44.159 --> 02:35:49.904]  Privately, he's a Great Info Wars follower and a supporter of Donald Trump.
[02:35:49.904 --> 02:35:53.807]  And he told me that he has never seen the number of illegals
[02:35:54.708 --> 02:35:55.009]  Yeah.
[02:36:10.808 --> 02:36:14.909]  to guarantee the integrity of this election.
[02:36:14.909 --> 02:36:26.513]  We've been screaming about voter fraud and illegal voter activities and the mainstream media continues to try to pretend that it just doesn't exist, that there is no voter fraud.
[02:36:27.993 --> 02:36:38.517]  And it's beyond the question of the manipulation of the computerized voting machines, which is a whole other level of concern inside these democratic urban machines.
[02:36:38.517 --> 02:36:42.279]  So take New Jersey, for example, where you have a surprisingly close U.S.
[02:36:42.279 --> 02:36:42.479]  race.
[02:36:43.039 --> 02:36:55.384]  Even though the Republican Party locally has been decimated most people have figured out that Bob Menendez is a crook and the bad publicity that he got about his investigation has put him in a close race.
[02:36:55.384 --> 02:37:05.047]  But I don't think in the end the level of voter theft in the city of Newark will be so great it will be hard to overcome.
[02:37:05.047 --> 02:37:11.930]  I concur with you and again we're seeing record Republican turnout but we're seeing record
[02:37:13.618 --> 02:37:13.898]  I think?
[02:37:43.558 --> 02:37:44.339]  Fascinating.
[02:37:44.339 --> 02:37:46.601]  Roger, I think you made a very good point.
[02:37:46.601 --> 02:37:48.783]  Wouldn't it be interesting?
[02:37:48.783 --> 02:37:51.665]  You see nationalism on the rise everywhere.
[02:37:51.665 --> 02:37:56.269]  You see the Bolsonaro victory in South America.
[02:37:56.269 --> 02:37:58.551]  You see us winning in Europe.
[02:37:58.551 --> 02:38:00.453]  You see what's happening in Eastern Europe.
[02:38:01.033 --> 02:38:04.955]  It would be an anomaly if we lose tomorrow's election.
[02:38:04.955 --> 02:38:09.558]  And that anomaly is caused by cold, hard cash.
[02:38:09.558 --> 02:38:15.281]  By the interference of George Soros and the EU and the Chinese in this election.
[02:38:15.281 --> 02:38:17.162]  We'll talk more about that.
[02:38:17.162 --> 02:38:24.326]  As well as the lethal combination of massive voter fraud and internet censorship of sites like InfoWars.
[02:38:24.366 --> 02:38:28.831]  Which we're going to play a clip of Trump and then go to Millie Weaver who'll be with us for several segments riding shotgun.
[02:38:28.831 --> 02:38:31.394]  She's in Cleveland at one of the big convention centers for a rally.
[02:38:32.930 --> 02:38:42.653]  There's a red wave, a populist wave, particularly with women worldwide who've been under socialism, who've been under communism, who've been under crony capitalism, who've been flooded by Islamic invasion.
[02:38:42.653 --> 02:38:46.394]  They're the ones, including socialist parties, who are joining with right-wingers.
[02:38:46.394 --> 02:38:49.615]  That's the secret combination, saying, we're sick of this crap.
[02:38:49.615 --> 02:38:51.555]  We remember the free market 20, 30 years ago.
[02:38:51.555 --> 02:38:52.555]  It's much better.
[02:38:52.555 --> 02:38:53.856]  We want to get out from under this.
[02:38:55.054 --> 02:39:01.896]  America may not have hurt enough yet, and been through the true socialist nightmare yet, to then wake up later.
[02:39:01.896 --> 02:39:11.300]  But see, the left knows that, so they're going to bring a real police state in if they get control so the process in Europe and Brazil and everywhere else doesn't follow through.
[02:39:11.300 --> 02:39:14.701]  Because these follow exact patterns, Roger.
[02:39:14.701 --> 02:39:19.723]  Let's play that clip, though, of the president saying he's getting ready to do antitrust and move against these people.
[02:39:19.723 --> 02:39:22.124]  But is it too little, too late?
[02:39:22.124 --> 02:39:22.484]  Here it is.
[02:39:23.780 --> 02:39:31.681]  You talked about what's been happening on social media, a lot of people questioning whether or not these companies are getting too big, too fast, your Facebooks, your Amazons.
[02:39:31.681 --> 02:39:37.282]  Have you put thought into how Amazon and Facebook specifically should be regulated?
[02:39:37.282 --> 02:39:43.943]  You look at the European Union, they find, I guess it was Google, billions of dollars.
[02:39:43.943 --> 02:39:47.804]  And frankly, I don't like that they're doing that, because that's an American company.
[02:39:47.804 --> 02:39:49.644]  I don't think it's good that they're doing that.
[02:39:49.644 --> 02:39:51.985]  But if anybody does that, that should be us doing it.
[02:39:52.685 --> 02:39:54.608]  That shouldn't be the European Union.
[02:39:54.608 --> 02:39:56.190]  Do you think you regulate in the first term?
[02:39:56.190 --> 02:40:00.856]  You know, you get into the whole thing with freedom of speech and what do you think?
[02:40:00.856 --> 02:40:01.797]  What about monopoly?
[02:40:01.797 --> 02:40:03.920]  What about saying the Justice Department look into the monopoly?
[02:40:03.920 --> 02:40:08.266]  I have so many people saying that, but it's certainly something that we have looked at.
[02:40:08.266 --> 02:40:09.167]  Would you ever break them up?
[02:40:10.008 --> 02:40:11.409]  They were talking about this years ago.
[02:40:11.409 --> 02:40:18.413]  You know they were actually talking about this same subject monopoly years ago long before I was in office.
[02:40:18.413 --> 02:40:19.474]  You think you'll be the man to do it?
[02:40:19.474 --> 02:40:24.837]  In fact a lot of people thought it was going to happen and then I guess a previous administration stopped it from happening.
[02:40:24.837 --> 02:40:26.257]  But you're in charge now?
[02:40:26.257 --> 02:40:26.918]  I'm in charge.
[02:40:26.918 --> 02:40:29.499]  I am definitely in charge and we are certainly looking at it.
[02:40:29.499 --> 02:40:31.180]  This is antitrust?
[02:40:31.180 --> 02:40:31.880]  Antitrust, yes.
[02:40:31.880 --> 02:40:33.601]  For Amazon?
[02:40:33.601 --> 02:40:33.862]  For...
[02:40:35.006 --> 02:40:36.167]  All three.
[02:40:36.167 --> 02:40:39.130]  So we want to talk about what's been happening on social media.
[02:40:56.075 --> 02:41:00.637]  14, no 15, no 14 of the 20 fake lawsuits thrown out.
[02:41:00.637 --> 02:41:02.837]  But it's cost a lot of money and it's taken our time and energy.
[02:41:02.837 --> 02:41:07.679]  But thanks to you standing with us, enough money came in to deal with it so far.
[02:41:07.679 --> 02:41:10.220]  So again, stand with us again, please.

[02:42:40.110 --> 02:42:42.291]  Unless they put a bullet in my head, but let's hope they don't go there.
[02:42:42.731 --> 02:42:44.954]  Because we've already launched the Second American Revolution.
[02:42:44.954 --> 02:42:48.079]  It's launching worldwide, as we predicted, and it's happening.
[02:42:48.079 --> 02:42:51.023]  People are judging liberty over slavery every time.

[02:43:04.818 --> 02:43:09.763]  I spend hours in front of a screen and then hours in front of bright lights every day.
[02:43:09.763 --> 02:43:12.826]  But thanks to super male vitality at Infowarestore.com.

[02:46:58.692 --> 02:47:12.139]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:47:12.139 --> 02:47:20.564]  Discover trends and global developments years before they happen, right here on The Alex Jones Show.
[02:47:39.201 --> 02:47:41.041]  Well, it's like deja vu.
[02:47:41.041 --> 02:47:48.503]  Here we are, one year and 364 days later, on the eve of what everybody agrees is the most important election in world history.
[02:47:48.503 --> 02:47:53.784]  Globalists have suffered defeats in over a hundred elections in the last six years.
[02:47:53.784 --> 02:48:02.186]  Brexit led the way to the American rebellion, and what we saw two years ago with Trump, and now Trump and the American people delivering on what we said we would do.
[02:48:03.550 --> 02:48:04.851]  It's been stunning.
[02:48:04.851 --> 02:48:12.158]  And I played predictions that Roger and I made two years ago on election night about how Trump would be faithful, and he has been.
[02:48:12.158 --> 02:48:17.463]  Now he must be faithful on the censorship, and faithful on stopping the illegals voting, and faithful on the wall.
[02:48:17.463 --> 02:48:18.804]  But he's trying as best he can.
[02:48:18.804 --> 02:48:22.968]  But Roger, I cannot underestimate, as we go to Millie Weaver and then Owen Schroer,
[02:48:24.204 --> 02:48:25.846]  I cannot understate.
[02:48:25.846 --> 02:48:27.789]  It's not a power trip.
[02:48:27.789 --> 02:48:36.660]  I don't say that InfoWars, with you and all our guests, is writing the script for the American reboot, for the American resurgence.
[02:48:36.660 --> 02:48:42.547]  Time Magazine, Newsweek, Hillary Clinton, the UN, the Times of London, and internal documents we just got.
[02:48:43.248 --> 02:48:53.957]  From some of the biggest hedge funds and the CIA leftist groups on how they're planning to shut... We've gotten the documents, I'm letting them know, that are going to send them to prison!
[02:48:55.014 --> 02:48:59.556]  And it's just as we thought, how they were... We're fighting deep networks here, okay?
[02:48:59.556 --> 02:49:00.516]  Very, very deep networks.
[02:49:00.516 --> 02:49:06.979]  So when listeners tune in, you have to understand, we are literally like Luke... Infowars is like Luke Skywalker and the X-Wing.
[02:49:06.979 --> 02:49:09.000]  Other X-Wings are getting blown up all around us.
[02:49:09.000 --> 02:49:11.561]  We're the one that already blew the Death Star up.
[02:49:11.561 --> 02:49:13.542]  But there's a couple more Death Stars.
[02:49:13.542 --> 02:49:15.302]  We blew the Death Star up two years ago.
[02:49:15.302 --> 02:49:18.944]  They're coming after us with bounty hunters right now.
[02:49:18.944 --> 02:49:22.846]  And let me tell you, I would bow out at this point, except we haven't won the war yet.
[02:49:22.846 --> 02:49:23.326]  I want...
[02:49:23.846 --> 02:49:26.370]  To not be in the fight 18 hours a day.
[02:49:26.370 --> 02:49:30.678]  But Roger, we have to explain to listeners, we are the heart of the resistance.
[02:49:30.678 --> 02:49:33.222]  And Matt Drudge understands it, he's the heart of the resistance too.
[02:49:33.222 --> 02:49:34.524]  We're all in this together.
[02:49:34.524 --> 02:49:35.426]  But listeners have to understand.
[02:49:36.781 --> 02:49:38.423]  This is a total war!
[02:49:38.423 --> 02:49:40.405]  This is real, Rogers!
[02:49:40.405 --> 02:49:43.288]  Alex, you couldn't have put it better yourself.
[02:49:43.288 --> 02:49:46.972]  They're trying to shut Infowars down because we are the tip of the spoon.
[02:49:46.972 --> 02:49:47.852]  They're trying to put you in prison!
[02:49:47.852 --> 02:49:49.034]  They're trying to put me in jail.
[02:49:49.034 --> 02:49:51.356]  They may assassinate you before this is over.
[02:49:51.356 --> 02:49:55.540]  They need to snuff us because we have led the way for freedom.
[02:49:55.540 --> 02:49:55.901]  Tell them!
[02:49:55.901 --> 02:49:56.922]  Tell them the grand jury this week!
[02:49:58.323 --> 02:49:59.944]  They want to put you in prison and me in prison.
[02:49:59.944 --> 02:50:11.713]  Despite the fact that they have no evidence whatsoever of any crime on our part, you can read it at Vice or the Daily Beast or Newsweek or the New York Times for that matter.
[02:50:11.713 --> 02:50:12.994]  It's a witch hunt.
[02:50:12.994 --> 02:50:17.217]  There's no evidence that we ever got any information from Julian Assange.
[02:50:17.217 --> 02:50:20.980]  Everything we did was perfectly legal to win this election.
[02:50:20.980 --> 02:50:22.721]  But now they want to punish us.
[02:50:22.721 --> 02:50:23.362]  Why?
[02:50:23.362 --> 02:50:26.364]  I wrote the Clinton's War on Women and I talked about it here.
[02:50:26.704 --> 02:50:27.504]  On InfoWars.
[02:50:27.504 --> 02:50:32.146]  Because our listeners, with the truth and their intel, we are the winners.
[02:50:32.146 --> 02:50:33.226]  We are the warriors.
[02:50:33.226 --> 02:50:34.167]  We're the winners.
[02:50:34.167 --> 02:50:36.808]  It's like having an NFL team like the Patriots that keep winning.
[02:50:36.808 --> 02:50:39.369]  They know we're just getting into our prime, man!
[02:50:39.369 --> 02:50:41.369]  They don't want to play us!
[02:50:41.369 --> 02:50:42.570]  We'll go to Owen Schroer in a moment.
[02:50:42.570 --> 02:50:43.970]  He is talking about kicking ass.
[02:50:43.970 --> 02:50:45.931]  Millie Weaver, you'll ride shotgun some of the next hour with me.
[02:50:45.931 --> 02:50:47.331]  I appreciate you holding there.
[02:50:47.331 --> 02:50:49.392]  Thankfully your Skype came back up.
[02:50:49.392 --> 02:50:54.074]  Tell us what you've seen on the road the last few months with the kick-butt job you and your team are doing.
[02:50:55.477 --> 02:51:10.349]  Well, we've just seen massive turnouts at these Donald Trump rallies and right now we're here in Cleveland, Ohio at the International Exposition Center where it looks like Trump finally picked a building that can house his massive crowds.
[02:51:10.969 --> 02:51:13.371]  This is a very big building here.
[02:51:13.371 --> 02:51:21.275]  I believe it's got an airport right next to it, which makes it a prime location since he's going to be stopping in at Cleveland, Ohio.
[02:51:21.275 --> 02:51:23.996]  I know his final destination is going to be in Missouri.
[02:51:23.996 --> 02:51:28.779]  He's going to have Sean Hannity and multiple other guests as well.
[02:51:28.779 --> 02:51:39.325]  Rush Limbaugh, that's right, appearing in his rally as kind of a final bang until the midterm elections happen tomorrow, which is when everyone is going to go out and vote.
[02:51:39.625 --> 02:51:41.726]  So far, people seem to be optimistic.
[02:51:41.726 --> 02:51:44.566]  They think that there's going to be a red wave.
[02:51:44.566 --> 02:51:56.469]  Most of them are not trusting the polls, given that last time, in 2016, the polls all said that Hillary Clinton was going to win by a landslide, and we know that Trump won by a landslide.
[02:51:56.469 --> 02:52:04.011]  So we're also here with Caitlin Bennett, who I'm going to pull in for a second here, and she's been talking to some of the protesters.
[02:52:05.669 --> 02:52:07.910]  Yeah, what do you think about some of the protesters?
[02:52:07.910 --> 02:52:09.290]  Was it a small blue puddle?
[02:52:09.290 --> 02:52:12.591]  Yeah, like I told Millie earlier, it was definitely a blue puddle.
[02:52:12.591 --> 02:52:14.571]  I don't know where they're getting this blue wave from.
[02:52:14.571 --> 02:52:16.632]  It's definitely not going to be anything like that.
[02:52:16.632 --> 02:52:22.793]  There's maybe only a dozen here compared to the thousands of Trump supporters and that's what we keep seeing at these Trump rallies.
[02:52:22.793 --> 02:52:27.154]  There's only a few protesters and there's thousands of supporters.
[02:52:28.035 --> 02:52:29.438]  Definitely.
[02:52:29.438 --> 02:52:37.433]  So far we've just seen that there haven't been as many protesters showing up to Trump's rallies lately as there had been in the past.
[02:52:37.433 --> 02:52:39.437]  It seems like they're taking a different approach.
[02:52:40.499 --> 02:52:42.780]  I don't know if you can hear us still out.
[02:52:42.780 --> 02:52:45.382]  Oh yes, there's a baby in the night.
[02:52:45.382 --> 02:52:46.242]  There's a woman in the night.
[02:52:46.242 --> 02:52:47.723]  She's got a baby in her arms.
[02:52:47.723 --> 02:52:49.044]  I'm gonna come right back to you in a moment.
[02:52:49.044 --> 02:52:49.724]  Owen's popping in.
[02:52:49.724 --> 02:52:51.465]  We'll continue with you ladies here in just a moment.
[02:52:51.465 --> 02:52:54.106]  Owen Schroyer is about to hit the third dimension.
[02:52:54.106 --> 02:53:01.610]  He's about to give the secret location of where that demonstration to take over some I-35 signs are here in Austin, Texas.
[02:53:01.610 --> 02:53:02.631]  So Owen, tell us about that.
[02:53:03.254 --> 02:53:04.175]  That's right, Alex.
[02:53:04.175 --> 02:53:09.359]  The InfoWars Army, some people here in Texas, they're traveling from San Antonio, Dallas, Houston.
[02:53:09.359 --> 02:53:10.240]  They're all going to be here.
[02:53:10.240 --> 02:53:11.741]  I'm really excited to meet them.
[02:53:11.741 --> 02:53:16.485]  We're holding signs on the Riverside Bridge over Highway 35.
[02:53:16.485 --> 02:53:18.226]  Now, I've got about 12 signs.
[02:53:18.226 --> 02:53:19.767]  One of them is right here behind me.
[02:53:19.767 --> 02:53:21.729]  Vote Red, Vote Dem Out.
[02:53:21.729 --> 02:53:24.711]  I've got, I think, 12 signs, so you don't need to bring a sign.
[02:53:24.711 --> 02:53:26.193]  I've got a big sign for you.
[02:53:26.193 --> 02:53:27.333]  Or you can bring your own sign.
[02:53:27.333 --> 02:53:29.375]  People bring flags and all kinds of stuff.
[02:53:29.375 --> 02:53:32.738]  And again, the idea is for photo op to trigger a chain reaction.
[02:53:33.258 --> 02:53:37.505]  Plus there's going to be, we'll probably get at least 10,000 eyes on these signs.
[02:53:37.505 --> 02:53:40.409]  Highway 35 is the biggest highway in Austin, Texas.
[02:53:40.409 --> 02:53:44.475]  And you announced the location last minute, so Antifa don't come out and try to stop.
[02:53:44.475 --> 02:53:44.995]  That's right.
[02:53:44.995 --> 02:53:47.539]  That's the Riverside Bridge on I-35.
[02:53:47.539 --> 02:53:48.200]  You can't miss it.
[02:53:48.200 --> 02:53:49.222]  Plenty of parking around there.
[02:53:49.582 --> 02:53:50.102]  That's right.
[02:53:50.102 --> 02:53:53.344]  So Riverside Bridge, I-35, I'm going to be there at 5 o'clock.
[02:53:53.344 --> 02:53:54.885]  Meet me there at 5 o'clock.
[02:53:54.885 --> 02:53:55.966]  We're going to be there for an hour.
[02:53:55.966 --> 02:53:57.207]  It's rush hour.
[02:53:57.207 --> 02:54:03.390]  And I'm expecting maybe, I know some leftists have been trying to get this intel out of me for a while, so they're probably going to tune in.
[02:54:03.390 --> 02:54:04.171]  We'll see if they show up.
[02:54:04.171 --> 02:54:06.032]  But hey, I invite them to join me.
[02:54:06.032 --> 02:54:06.852]  I invite them to join me.
[02:54:06.852 --> 02:54:07.413]  Come join.
[02:54:07.413 --> 02:54:08.633]  We're anti-fascist too.
[02:54:08.633 --> 02:54:11.695]  We don't like the fascism at Google and Apple and YouTube and all of that.
[02:54:11.695 --> 02:54:13.356]  So we're anti-fascist.
[02:54:13.356 --> 02:54:14.497]  They're anti-fascist.
[02:54:14.497 --> 02:54:16.318]  So maybe they can actually join us this time.
[02:54:16.658 --> 02:54:19.419]  We're going to have live coverage all the way up to midnight tonight at the War Room.
[02:54:19.419 --> 02:54:22.861]  You and Roger Stone and so many other big guests that I should be mentioning who's coming up today.
[02:54:22.861 --> 02:54:23.742]  There are so many.
[02:54:23.742 --> 02:54:26.823]  We already had Ted Nugent on, Mike Adams.
[02:54:26.823 --> 02:54:28.684]  We're going to have Owen Benjamin.
[02:54:28.684 --> 02:54:29.845]  We're going to have Mike Cernovich.
[02:54:29.845 --> 02:54:31.086]  We're going to have Matt Bracken.
[02:54:31.086 --> 02:54:32.646]  I want to get Will Johnson on.
[02:54:32.646 --> 02:54:33.427]  And so many more.
[02:54:33.427 --> 02:54:36.248]  And then tomorrow, more than 24-hour live coverage, 8 a.m.
[02:54:36.248 --> 02:54:39.390]  right through into the next day at Infowars.com forward slash show.
[02:54:39.910 --> 02:54:44.231]  And at Infowars.com, there's a page always up there on the front page that says, watch the live coverage.
[02:54:44.231 --> 02:54:45.551]  That's the link to share.
[02:54:45.551 --> 02:54:50.652]  Oh, and five o'clock today, Riverside in Austin, Texas, you'll have big giant signs for folks.
[02:54:50.652 --> 02:54:53.253]  Everybody come out there, videotape it, live stream it.
[02:54:53.253 --> 02:54:54.093]  You are the resistance.
[02:54:54.093 --> 02:54:54.653]  Great job.
[02:54:54.653 --> 02:54:57.574]  Going back to Millie Weaver there.
[02:54:57.574 --> 02:54:59.394]  Millie, what does your gut level tell you?
[02:54:59.394 --> 02:55:03.095]  I think Trump revolution continues because he delivered on the economy.
[02:55:04.110 --> 02:55:11.039]  But my concern, Millie, is that there's so much fraud, so much censorship, so much intimidation that they're going to try to steal the election.
[02:55:11.039 --> 02:55:13.803]  What do you think?
[02:55:13.803 --> 02:55:16.907]  You know, I think it's probably going to be close.
[02:55:19.055 --> 02:55:20.276]  And again, Mel, you're awesome.
[02:55:20.276 --> 02:55:26.520]  We're going to let her go, because that's why I didn't go to her earlier, because the Skype, there's so many tens of thousands, they're already getting there early for Trump.
[02:55:26.520 --> 02:55:28.561]  They're sapping all the internet strength.
[02:55:28.561 --> 02:55:35.045]  So maybe if she can get to another location, we'll go back to her and Caitlin Bennett doing an absolutely kick-butt job.
[02:55:35.045 --> 02:55:35.926]  I want to hear her prediction.
[02:55:35.926 --> 02:55:36.786]  And I'm not hedging bets.
[02:55:36.786 --> 02:55:38.507]  Last year I said absolutely winning.
[02:55:38.507 --> 02:55:39.148]  You watched, do it.
[02:55:39.148 --> 02:55:40.048]  It was my gut level.
[02:55:40.048 --> 02:55:40.789]  I knew it.
[02:55:40.789 --> 02:55:42.290]  In fact, I'm not even into fancy things.
[02:55:43.848 --> 02:55:45.089]  People bought me watches.
[02:55:45.089 --> 02:55:50.635]  And I actually went out and bought my dad a really nice watch the day before the election.
[02:55:50.635 --> 02:55:54.759]  And I said, I'm giving you this watch to signify the victory and the resurgence of America.
[02:55:54.759 --> 02:55:56.000]  He said, you really think he's going to win?
[02:55:56.000 --> 02:55:57.281]  I said, you absolutely watch.
[02:55:57.281 --> 02:55:58.402]  I know he is.
[02:55:58.402 --> 02:56:00.244]  Right now, my gut's never wrong.
[02:56:00.244 --> 02:56:02.166]  I feel like it's undecided.
[02:56:02.166 --> 02:56:04.028]  I think it's going to be a very close race.
[02:56:04.028 --> 02:56:04.969]  I don't think this is decided.
[02:56:05.769 --> 02:56:06.750]  Alex, I agree with you.
[02:56:06.750 --> 02:56:10.872]  And again, I think if we got an honest count, this wouldn't even be in doubt.
[02:56:10.872 --> 02:56:14.514]  We're facing multiple obstacles we didn't have in 2016.
[02:56:14.514 --> 02:56:15.795]  They were overconfident.
[02:56:15.795 --> 02:56:21.439]  In all honesty, if Hillary Clinton had bothered to show up in Michigan or Wisconsin, she might have won.
[02:56:21.439 --> 02:56:22.179]  Or Pennsylvania.
[02:56:22.179 --> 02:56:22.879]  Or Pennsylvania.
[02:56:22.879 --> 02:56:24.641]  But she took those for granted.
[02:56:24.641 --> 02:56:28.883]  She got outworked and outfoxed by Donald Trump and the Trump campaign.
[02:56:28.883 --> 02:56:34.106]  Frankly, the emergence of Danny Williams, Bill's abandoned son, made a real difference.
[02:56:34.106 --> 02:56:35.247]  By the way, you're not just saying that.
[02:56:35.367 --> 02:56:35.487]  Yes.
[02:56:53.667 --> 02:56:57.429]  Black folks, God love them, like everybody else, are waking up, man!
[02:56:57.429 --> 02:56:58.750]  They like jobs.
[02:56:58.750 --> 02:57:00.211]  They like opportunity.
[02:57:00.211 --> 02:57:02.092]  They like a prosperous future.
[02:57:02.092 --> 02:57:05.234]  So the president has made real inroads.
[02:57:05.234 --> 02:57:13.398]  Sure, they're incremental, but a shift of 10,000 votes in the city of Detroit shifted that state, Michigan, to Donald Trump.
[02:57:13.398 --> 02:57:13.698]  A shift!
[02:57:13.698 --> 02:57:16.400]  And I remember you said target everything on Michigan.
[02:57:16.400 --> 02:57:17.000]  You were doing nothing.
[02:57:17.000 --> 02:57:18.101]  We were doing Detroit radio.
[02:57:18.101 --> 02:57:20.002]  We were pumping ads in there with Danny Williams.
[02:57:20.442 --> 02:57:22.683]  Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania.
[02:57:22.683 --> 02:57:23.804]  There it is right there.
[02:57:23.804 --> 02:57:26.205]  And that's where we focus that effort.
[02:57:26.205 --> 02:57:28.046]  38 million people saw that video.
[02:57:28.046 --> 02:57:31.327]  8 million of them saw it through InfoWars.
[02:57:31.327 --> 02:57:33.628]  That's why they want to destroy us and put us in jail.
[02:57:33.628 --> 02:57:36.009]  Because, folks, we're not going to flinch or back down.
[02:57:36.009 --> 02:57:36.950]  They want to ram heads.
[02:57:36.950 --> 02:57:37.770]  They want to play chicken.
[02:57:37.770 --> 02:57:38.550]  We're doing it.
[02:57:38.550 --> 02:57:43.753]  But your prayers and support gives us more jet fuel to make sure when we make that connection, it is destructive.
[02:57:45.134 --> 02:57:55.721]  We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own four years of seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature to detoxify the body.
[02:57:55.721 --> 02:57:57.782]  That's why I'm introducing Z-SHIELD.
[02:57:57.782 --> 02:58:00.644]  Toxic Metal and Chemical Defense Support.
[02:58:00.644 --> 02:58:02.145]  It's made in the USA.
[02:58:02.145 --> 02:58:05.267]  It's filled with known compounds from nature that are
[02:58:05.507 --> 02:58:08.950]  Absolutely associated with detoxifying the body and it supports the info war.
[02:58:08.950 --> 02:58:11.031]  It is a classical 360 win.
[02:58:11.031 --> 02:58:20.739]  This is the formula that I personally have been taking for over a year and now we believe we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly get.
[02:58:20.739 --> 02:58:33.168]  You owe it to yourself, you owe it to your family, and you owe it to the future of this country and the world that patriots stay as healthy and as clean and as focused as you can be because we need you, the remnant of America, to
[02:58:33.308 --> 02:58:37.555]  To reignite those brush fires to the next level and to be healthy and as focused as you can be.
[02:58:37.555 --> 02:58:40.861]  Thanks to your support and your prayers, together, we're changing the world.
[02:58:40.861 --> 02:58:44.466]  Now it's time to change our bodies with Z-Field at InfoWarsLive.com
[02:58:46.221 --> 02:58:50.464]  Please, whatever you do, realize that we're all getting punched drunk to the censorship.
[02:58:50.464 --> 02:58:53.926]  And you saw 18 Twitter accounts, they say, affiliated with InfoWars.
[02:58:53.926 --> 02:58:55.708]  Yeah, some of them are like little side accounts.
[02:58:55.708 --> 02:58:58.970]  They know we had like InfoWars store that just showed our products.
[02:58:58.970 --> 02:59:05.754]  But they just banned them all yesterday in punishment that I be at a Trump rally and be mobbed by all these folks that loved us.
[02:59:05.754 --> 02:59:10.838]  Your excitement about America, your excitement about this broadcast is what brought the country and the world back from the brick.
[02:59:11.178 --> 02:59:17.282]  But the globalists now want to target where the resistance came from, so that we're not pesky in the future.
[02:59:17.282 --> 02:59:20.263]  I want to be troublesome and pesky.
[02:59:20.263 --> 02:59:21.364]  I want to keep going.
[02:59:21.364 --> 02:59:25.186]  I want to make them do the ultimate, not just destroy us financially.
[02:59:25.186 --> 02:59:27.207]  I want to push all the way.
[02:59:27.207 --> 02:59:28.508]  I've committed to do that.
[02:59:28.508 --> 02:59:31.229]  I've prayed for that, and I've been told that's going to happen.
[02:59:31.229 --> 02:59:33.651]  But you've got to back us, and I promise you this.
[02:59:34.151 --> 02:59:35.272]  I will never falter.
[02:59:35.272 --> 02:59:37.794]  I will never waver at the spiritual level.
[02:59:37.794 --> 02:59:38.755]  I physically will.
[02:59:38.755 --> 02:59:49.583]  But I give you my commitment, if you financially support us, InfoWarshaw.com, to give you my absolute total commitment.
[02:59:49.583 --> 02:59:52.205]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:02.671 --> 03:00:07.526]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones!
[03:00:27.839 --> 03:00:28.479]  All right, Roger.
[03:00:28.479 --> 03:00:31.700]  I want to go back to the subject we were talking about at the start of the last hour.
[03:00:31.700 --> 03:00:34.681]  The amazing video of Axios kind of dragging out Trump.
[03:00:34.681 --> 03:00:35.902]  Well, what are you going to do to big tech?
[03:00:35.902 --> 03:00:37.362]  What are you going to do to Amazon?
[03:00:37.362 --> 03:00:40.783]  And then he finally says, look, it should have been done before.
[03:00:40.783 --> 03:00:44.865]  We shouldn't have the EU coming in and doing regulations to our companies.
[03:00:44.865 --> 03:00:49.186]  That's basically allowing a foreign power to control us.
[03:00:49.186 --> 03:00:50.326]  We need to go after these folks.
[03:00:50.326 --> 03:00:51.387]  I don't want to hurt the companies.
[03:00:51.387 --> 03:00:52.787]  I don't want to hurt America.
[03:00:52.787 --> 03:00:54.388]  But they can't meddle in elections.
[03:00:54.388 --> 03:00:55.088]  They can't do all this.
[03:00:55.908 --> 03:00:57.488]  Why do you think he's only doing it now?
[03:00:57.488 --> 03:01:03.350]  Because it's a popular issue, it's the right thing to do, it's one of the few areas that I think the President's dropped the ball.
[03:01:03.350 --> 03:01:04.170]  I'd say two things.
[03:01:04.170 --> 03:01:14.712]  One thing, what I really liked about that interview, Alex, was the fact that the President said, always looking at the bottom line for America, if anybody's going to be fighting these companies, it ought to be us.
[03:01:14.712 --> 03:01:16.772]  You see, that's for the taxpayers.
[03:01:16.772 --> 03:01:17.993]  That's for the bottom line.
[03:01:17.993 --> 03:01:19.793]  That's why you have a businessman as President.
[03:01:20.493 --> 03:01:28.762]  In all honesty, my guess is the President has probably urged his Justice Department to look into this and they have done nothing because they're for the status quo.
[03:01:28.762 --> 03:01:33.066]  The President has to get control of his Justice Department after this election.
[03:01:33.066 --> 03:01:35.629]  He needs to fire Sessions and clean house.
[03:01:35.629 --> 03:01:42.696]  If he does not do that, whether it is illegal immigration or election fraud or internet censorship, the country will not survive.
[03:01:42.756 --> 03:01:46.399]  Because if they get away with all this incredible, unprecedented stuff, they're going to go even crazier.
[03:01:46.399 --> 03:01:59.892]  And again, when I had that report written by antitrust lawyers, three different law firms, you worked on it, we paid to have it done, we got it delivered to Trump, that's when they started censoring me off the web and accelerating, because Big Tech is actually spying on everybody.
[03:01:59.892 --> 03:02:02.414]  They got so angry, but I knew to put up front
[03:02:03.135 --> 03:02:09.023]  Trump gets it's not right to have foreign powers, A, regulating us, and then B, doing multi-billion dollar fines.
[03:02:09.023 --> 03:02:12.447]  I said, sir, it's time for you to do this, but for real reasons.
[03:02:12.447 --> 03:02:19.596]  Instead, you're letting them bring regulatory control over us, and they want censorship to stop the fines.
[03:02:20.777 --> 03:02:23.961]  We will start fines if they engage in censorship.
[03:02:23.961 --> 03:02:28.467]  And I think just the total common sense of that, from what I was told, absolutely.
[03:02:28.467 --> 03:02:30.109]  I mean, I am bragging here.
[03:02:30.109 --> 03:02:30.990]  We took action.
[03:02:30.990 --> 03:02:32.271]  We busted ass.
[03:02:32.271 --> 03:02:37.357]  I got sanctioned for it, but it's well worth it when big tech gets a broomstick shoved up its rear end.
[03:02:38.378 --> 03:02:40.059]  Alex, I hope that you're right.
[03:02:40.059 --> 03:02:45.662]  I mean, in all honesty, the Democrats cheated in every way possible in 2016.
[03:02:45.662 --> 03:02:53.046]  You had state surveillance of the Republican candidate for president, with no probable cause, because he was in touch with the Russians.
[03:02:53.046 --> 03:02:56.348]  That's invented, contrived nonsense.
[03:02:56.348 --> 03:03:00.871]  So, they cheated, a crime far worse than Watergate, and they still couldn't win.
[03:03:01.571 --> 03:03:06.275]  There's a Republican majority in the country now, if we can get an honest count.
[03:03:06.275 --> 03:03:21.647]  But between widespread voter fraud, illegal immigration and the voting of illegals, and this net-based censorship of which InfoWars has been the main focus because we are the most audacious and we are the most outrageous
[03:03:21.647 --> 03:03:25.511]  Trump should have pulled the trigger when he had absolutely everything assured.
[03:03:25.511 --> 03:03:26.773]  He should have released the classifieds.
[03:03:26.773 --> 03:03:27.734]  Here's where he messed up.
[03:03:27.734 --> 03:03:29.116]  Should have gone after the censorship.
[03:03:29.116 --> 03:03:30.838]  Should have gone for the illegal voting earlier.
[03:03:30.838 --> 03:03:37.125]  But he's not all powerful and should have, you know, pulled the trigger on releasing the classified data that showed they were spying on him.
[03:03:37.185 --> 03:03:39.726]  And it all boils right back to where?
[03:03:39.726 --> 03:03:40.986]  The Justice Department.
[03:03:40.986 --> 03:03:44.087]  Who talked him out of declassifying those documents?
[03:03:44.087 --> 03:03:45.808]  Rod Rosenstein.
[03:03:45.808 --> 03:03:54.570]  Those documents are central because the readers from the British and the Australians have weighed in and said, oh, please don't declassify these.
[03:03:54.570 --> 03:03:56.591]  They would expose our sources and methods.
[03:03:56.591 --> 03:04:02.713]  No, what they'll expose is the British and the Australians were complicit in the spying on Donald Trump.
[03:04:02.713 --> 03:04:03.753]  It is that simple.
[03:04:04.173 --> 03:04:12.941]  So, they cheated using an abuse of power, the use of the authority and the capability of the state to spy on the Trump campaign.
[03:04:12.941 --> 03:04:13.422]  And it's confirmed!
[03:04:13.422 --> 03:04:29.037]  And you're the one that said on January 20th of last year, in front of the whole world, you're the one that said all of this, the key is the FISA court, the key is the illegal spying, and you're right, and now Trump is doing it, but how did they convince him to not release it?
[03:04:29.817 --> 03:04:35.960]  They convinced him that it would upset our allies and it would expose our methods and sources, which is nonsense.
[03:04:35.960 --> 03:04:39.982]  What it will expose is the criminality of the Obama Justice Department.
[03:04:54.042 --> 03:05:03.332]  The globalists know that if they suppress the good halogen and pump the environment full of the bad halogens, fluoride, chlorine, bromine, you name it, that it lowers IQ.
[03:05:03.332 --> 03:05:06.195]  It literally dumbs the population down.
[03:05:06.195 --> 03:05:12.241]  And on our quest to bring our listeners and viewers the best iodine in the world, we've gone through two permutations.
[03:05:12.902 --> 03:05:19.168]  First, seaweed-based iodine that was pretty good but hard to source, and the Globels tried to block us getting a supply of it.
[03:05:19.168 --> 03:05:25.474]  So we discovered deep-earth crystals of pure nascent iodine and brought you X2 that's been incredible.
[03:05:25.474 --> 03:05:32.501]  Now, due to the Establishment trying to block that, we did more research and secured more of the deep-earth crystals of nascent iodine.
[03:05:32.501 --> 03:05:32.701]  But!
[03:05:33.542 --> 03:05:46.572]  Chemists, scientists, and others showed us the research that by combining it with three other compounds, two forms of iodine and vitamin C, it supercharges it and makes it even more bioavailable.
[03:05:46.572 --> 03:05:50.815]  Ladies and gentlemen, you want to research it, you want to see it, it's an incredible discovery.
[03:05:50.815 --> 03:05:53.517]  X3, now available at mfulworthslife.com.
[03:05:55.031 --> 03:06:02.138]  We've got it.
[03:06:02.138 --> 03:06:06.522]  Waging war on corruption.
[03:06:06.522 --> 03:06:12.208]  It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the Infowar.
[03:06:28.812 --> 03:06:47.862]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, the election headquarters for real information, for real analysis is Infowars.com, Newswars.com, Stonecoldtruth.com, and of course, ladies and gentlemen, Gerald Salente's websites, TrendsResearch.com.
[03:06:47.862 --> 03:06:51.044]  You absolutely need to go there to find out the latest.
[03:06:51.624 --> 03:06:53.046]  We've had so many great guests on.
[03:06:53.046 --> 03:06:56.509]  Ted Nugent, Brandon Darby, Millie Weaver, Owen Schroer.
[03:06:56.509 --> 03:07:01.374]  We're going until midnight tonight, and then we're back tomorrow for over 24 hours live broadcast.
[03:07:01.374 --> 03:07:02.435]  I wanted to bring Celente in.
[03:07:02.435 --> 03:07:12.746]  He's going to be taking over the hour, but for this hour it's a roundtable with myself and Roger Stone to A, get his gut-level prediction for tomorrow, and then my question and Roger's question to get your angle on it.
[03:07:13.547 --> 03:07:31.414]  Regardless of who wins tomorrow, the fact that Trump didn't go after the censorship more, he gave some lip service, which is better than nothing, and the fact that they didn't stop the illegals voting, and the fact that they allowed all this Chinese foreign meddling, which was public in the election, really is scary to me and I think they've dropped the ball.
[03:07:31.414 --> 03:07:38.757]  Forget red waves, blue waves, we've seen a un-American censorship wave, which Trump says he's preparing to go after, but why after the election?
[03:07:38.757 --> 03:07:42.919]  And Trump letting the Justice Department run all over him and the American people,
[03:07:44.090 --> 03:07:54.120]  With this fake Russiagate is insane, with Mueller leaking that he's set to probably, and claiming a lot of this is fake news, indict Roger Stone the next few weeks.
[03:07:54.120 --> 03:08:06.552]  When I was on the inside of the whole thing, and I remember literally yelling at Assange on air, sending him mean emails, Roger doing it, saying, why are you giving the New York Times interviews and not us?
[03:08:07.253 --> 03:08:12.616]  They had said that the WikiLeaks was going to hurt Hillary and Podesta on the news.
[03:08:12.616 --> 03:08:17.620]  Then we said that, we hyped it up because it was important, and now he's facing prison.
[03:08:17.620 --> 03:08:22.002]  You said the grand jury reportedly, they're constantly asking about me.
[03:08:22.002 --> 03:08:28.486]  They want to know, did Alex Jones know whether Roger Stone got allegedly hacked emails from WikiLeaks?
[03:08:28.486 --> 03:08:31.989]  Well, the answer is no, because I received no such thing.
[03:08:32.729 --> 03:08:40.061]  It's a witch hunt, but you're looking at two of the prime suspects in the victory of the 2016 election, and that's what this is about.
[03:08:40.061 --> 03:08:43.026]  And you don't have to believe us!
[03:08:43.026 --> 03:08:44.388]  Here's the prime example, Donald Trump Jr.
[03:08:45.962 --> 03:08:47.383]  Last year.
[03:08:47.383 --> 03:08:51.025]  And then this year again, they go, oh, national news, Donald Trump Jr.
[03:08:51.025 --> 03:08:55.448]  He had the code keys to WikiLeaks and sent them to his dad and said, oh, look, here's the WikiLeaks.
[03:08:55.448 --> 03:08:56.389]  Look at this.
[03:08:56.389 --> 03:08:59.170]  It was almost two months after it was public.
[03:08:59.170 --> 03:09:01.051]  I'm actually sad that Don Jr.
[03:09:01.051 --> 03:09:03.413]  took, you know, almost 60 days.
[03:09:03.413 --> 03:09:06.695]  The craziness is we were following what Assange said.
[03:09:06.695 --> 03:09:09.296]  Anyone can go back to the news articles at the time.
[03:09:09.296 --> 03:09:10.837]  So what's the word on the grand jury?
[03:09:10.837 --> 03:09:13.539]  I know you've had exculpatory witnesses there.
[03:09:13.539 --> 03:09:14.880]  What do they say when they see this?
[03:09:15.160 --> 03:09:19.442]  No, it's hard to say because grand juries are easy to mislead.
[03:09:19.442 --> 03:09:39.269]  We know that they heard from an exculpatory witness who testified that Randy Credico confirmed to him, to his face, and in a text message, that he was the one who tipped me that whatever Assange said he had, which he announced on CNN in June and Fox in August on Hillary Clinton, was big.
[03:09:39.269 --> 03:09:41.350]  That it would cost her the election.
[03:09:41.350 --> 03:09:43.090]  It was a bombshell.
[03:09:43.090 --> 03:09:44.251]  Devastating.
[03:09:44.251 --> 03:09:44.611]  Coming.
[03:09:45.432 --> 03:09:49.897]  And he reiterated this all through September, and he was right.
[03:09:49.897 --> 03:09:51.219]  Everything he told me was right.
[03:09:51.219 --> 03:09:54.182]  But there's no inside information here.
[03:09:54.182 --> 03:10:02.473]  Instead of listening to that exculpatory witness, they now seem to be wrapping them around the idea that I tried to intimidate or
[03:10:04.315 --> 03:10:05.735]  Pressure at Credico.
[03:10:05.735 --> 03:10:07.996]  I was very angry at Credico.
[03:10:07.996 --> 03:10:13.818]  Not because he wouldn't lie, but because he refuses, even to this day, to tell the truth.
[03:10:13.818 --> 03:10:20.080]  To the extent that I was angry with him, it was over his refusal to fess up about what he really did.
[03:10:20.080 --> 03:10:21.681]  He was my source.
[03:10:21.681 --> 03:10:24.742]  If you force me to prove it, I can.
[03:10:24.742 --> 03:10:29.123]  Alex Jones has no knowledge of us receiving anything from WikiLeaks.
[03:10:29.123 --> 03:10:31.724]  Other than me squeezing you saying, can't you get through to them?
[03:10:31.724 --> 03:10:33.685]  You said, no, I know one guy that talks to him.
[03:10:33.945 --> 03:10:37.708]  Yeah, I mean, we just, you know, we took what was publicly available information.
[03:10:37.708 --> 03:10:38.469]  Well, you're going to get to it more.
[03:10:38.469 --> 03:10:39.650]  You're hosting for three hours coming up.
[03:10:39.650 --> 03:10:41.671]  I just wanted to get... Gerald Slinda, you're taking over.
[03:10:41.671 --> 03:10:42.432]  God love you.
[03:10:42.432 --> 03:10:43.453]  FriendsResearch.com.
[03:10:43.453 --> 03:10:44.794]  What do you make of all this?
[03:10:44.794 --> 03:10:46.875]  What do you predict tomorrow?
[03:10:46.875 --> 03:11:00.166]  Well, the big thing that I see that I never saw before, and you guys have been around a long time as well, is to get out to vote movement, particularly as being funded by the Democrats.
[03:11:00.166 --> 03:11:02.508]  And when you're looking at the data coming in,
[03:11:03.590 --> 03:11:08.532]  Early voting tallies continue to surge.
[03:11:08.532 --> 03:11:09.772]  At historic rates.
[03:11:09.772 --> 03:11:16.015]  This is from the Wall Street Journal this weekend, according to public available information.
[03:11:16.015 --> 03:11:23.298]  As of Sunday, more than 34 million people have voted in the 2018 midterms.
[03:11:23.298 --> 03:11:31.621]  Further evidence that the election will significantly outpace turnout in previous elections at midterm time.
[03:11:32.344 --> 03:11:34.165]  So that's the big one.
[03:11:34.165 --> 03:11:44.368]  That's the unknown right now, because a lot of these also new people that they're getting out to vote are younger people.
[03:11:44.368 --> 03:11:51.290]  And when we look at the election in Georgia, for example, the majority of the people voting are women.
[03:11:51.290 --> 03:11:58.532]  So the outcome is really up in the air, but we're standing with what most are saying right now.
[03:11:59.147 --> 03:12:06.929]  And that is that the House will go Democratic and the Senate may stay Republican.
[03:12:06.929 --> 03:12:28.435]  One of the shortcomings, and it's noted in the media as well, whether it's the Financial Times, the Wall Street Journal, is that what Trump has failed to do, not only in terms of the censorship issue, which is really above most people's concern, they're not really concerned that much with it, the average voter.
[03:12:29.091 --> 03:12:30.812]  Is the economy.
[03:12:30.812 --> 03:12:38.796]  And you know, you remember that great line that they used to use in the Clinton campaign back in 1992 when they wanted to win the election?
[03:12:38.796 --> 03:12:41.097]  It's the economy, stupid!
[03:12:41.097 --> 03:12:41.657]  You got it.
[03:12:42.722 --> 03:13:03.618]  So that was the one failure that we see, that although he keeps bringing it up from time to time, too many distractions and not enough on that, because it's basically a pocketbook issue, and those are the main issues right now, and the divided states of America has pushed it to other issues.
[03:13:03.618 --> 03:13:08.102]  And in talking about the Russian hacking into America's election,
[03:13:08.886 --> 03:13:10.808]  Let's suppose they did.
[03:13:10.808 --> 03:13:17.132]  And of course we know, as do your listeners, that there's not one shred of evidence that they did.
[03:13:17.132 --> 03:13:21.335]  It's our assumption, it's our conclusion, it's our BS that they did.
[03:13:21.335 --> 03:13:24.017]  But suppose they did.
[03:13:24.017 --> 03:13:28.981]  What was the information that these terrible hackers brought out?
[03:13:28.981 --> 03:13:33.144]  What a criminal operation the Clinton administration
[03:13:33.989 --> 03:13:35.730]  Is and was.
[03:13:35.730 --> 03:13:41.672]  And the payoffs that they've gotten for doing all the dirty deeds of robbing Americans.
[03:13:41.672 --> 03:13:42.412]  No, but you're right.
[03:13:42.412 --> 03:13:45.413]  But you gotta hand it to them how they changed the subject.
[03:13:45.413 --> 03:13:46.473]  Exactly.
[03:13:46.473 --> 03:13:48.394]  And that's what the issue is.
[03:13:48.394 --> 03:13:55.136]  That they're getting... You can hear Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton BS for free all day long.
[03:13:55.136 --> 03:13:58.077]  You don't have to pay them $300,000 an hour from the Goldman Sachs gang.
[03:14:01.927 --> 03:14:12.190]  Why do you think the major networks are so anti-Republican and so anti-Alex Jones?
[03:14:12.190 --> 03:14:21.873]  Because Bill Clinton sold us out with the Federal Communications Act of 1996 that allowed five companies to control
[03:14:23.580 --> 03:14:25.021]  90% of the media.
[03:14:25.021 --> 03:14:26.783]  It's called payback.
[03:14:26.783 --> 03:14:28.724]  They got paid back.
[03:14:28.724 --> 03:14:33.087]  That should have been the issue rather than, I don't know, the Russians.
[03:14:33.087 --> 03:14:34.068]  The Russians are coming.
[03:14:34.068 --> 03:14:35.549]  The Russians are coming.
[03:14:35.549 --> 03:14:37.591]  So the major issue has been lost.
[03:14:37.591 --> 03:14:41.053]  And by the way, as you know, I'm a political atheist.
[03:14:41.053 --> 03:14:45.877]  I don't like either the blunts or the crips or the Republicans or the Democrats.
[03:14:45.877 --> 03:14:49.479]  So Twitter deleted more than 10,000 accounts that
[03:14:52.231 --> 03:14:52.571]  Yeah, right.
[03:14:52.571 --> 03:14:52.911]  No, no.
[03:15:12.278 --> 03:15:15.181]  No, I agree, the story's real, you're right, they did that.
[03:15:15.181 --> 03:15:19.385]  I've just experienced where they claim, oh, Jones is fake news, or Jones says he hates Jews.
[03:15:19.385 --> 03:15:20.466]  We deleted his Twitter.
[03:15:20.466 --> 03:15:27.594]  They just lie about the reason too, but I get on its face, they're saying, wait, you're not allowed to say voting in many cases is a fraud?
[03:15:27.594 --> 03:15:28.134]  Great points.
[03:15:28.134 --> 03:15:31.718]  Gerald Cilente, you're taking over right now, friendsresearch.com.
[03:15:31.718 --> 03:15:34.541]  And then coming up in 45 minutes, The War Room with Owen Schroer.
[03:15:35.141 --> 03:15:44.367]  And Roger Stone, loaded for bear, and I'm gonna be up here all night long till midnight with a bunch of hosts, a bunch of clips, a bunch of breaking news.
[03:15:44.367 --> 03:15:45.548]  It's all coming up.
[03:15:45.548 --> 03:15:46.769]  And how do you get past the censors?

[03:19:47.174 --> 03:19:49.915]  Unleash the Supermail in you.
[03:19:49.915 --> 03:19:57.158]  Supermail Vitality from Infowarsstore.com.
[03:19:57.158 --> 03:19:59.799]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:22.188 --> 03:20:25.309]  Hi, this is Gerald Cilenti sitting in for Alex Jones.
[03:20:25.309 --> 03:20:30.572]  It's always a real treat and an honor to host InfoWars.
[03:20:30.572 --> 03:20:40.256]  It's one of the few places on earth where you get real news that makes a difference rather than the garbage that they're putting out there.
[03:20:40.256 --> 03:20:44.437]  So the midterm elections, of course, that's the news of the time.
[03:20:44.437 --> 03:20:48.099]  And so what we do as trend forecasters is we read
[03:20:48.809 --> 03:20:53.653]  As much as we can and listen and watch what's going on around the world.
[03:20:53.653 --> 03:21:05.283]  So I want to go over a couple of articles with you that put some things into perspective and not so into perspective and what to expect if the Democrats win or the Republicans win or the House is split.
[03:21:05.283 --> 03:21:08.846]  There's a major story in today's Wall Street Journal.
[03:21:08.846 --> 03:21:12.869]  Investors fret profits are peaking is one of them.
[03:21:12.869 --> 03:21:16.913]  But the other one, of course, is midterm votes have investors on edge.
[03:21:17.881 --> 03:21:24.365]  And here's what they say, and again this is separating the fact from the fiction.
[03:21:24.365 --> 03:21:33.250]  In reading through it, just getting to a point, many agree that the elections could create fresh winners and losers in the market.
[03:21:33.250 --> 03:21:46.538]  Manufacturers and construction firms could get a boost if a divided Congress can come to an agreement on infrastructure spending, while banks stand to lose if a democratic sweep
[03:21:47.461 --> 03:21:51.683]  leads to a halt in deregulation.
[03:21:51.683 --> 03:21:55.926]  Alright, so let's look at the deregulation issue here.
[03:21:55.926 --> 03:22:08.673]  There's deregulation, and it's a positive one in the elements, that the small banks have really been hit hard with the Dodd-Frank amendments that were put in following the panic of 08.
[03:22:08.673 --> 03:22:11.974]  The big banks just got bigger.
[03:22:11.974 --> 03:22:14.676]  So it's not going to hurt them at all.
[03:22:14.676 --> 03:22:16.717]  And as far as infrastructure spending,
[03:22:17.870 --> 03:22:20.931]  It's not going very fast or very much.
[03:22:20.931 --> 03:22:26.173]  That's not going to have a big play on the equity markets.
[03:22:26.173 --> 03:22:28.434]  Here's what's really going on.
[03:22:28.434 --> 03:22:33.316]  The numbers don't lie and the facts stand by themselves.
[03:22:33.316 --> 03:22:41.980]  History suggests the stock market will fare well no matter who wins on Tuesday.
[03:22:41.980 --> 03:22:47.522]  The S&P 500 has risen in the year after every midterm election
[03:22:48.837 --> 03:23:16.931]  Since 1946, according to brokerage and advisory firm Strategus, analysts attributed this to investors redeploying funds kept on the sidelines ahead of the elections, as well as the market's tendency to climb throughout history.
[03:23:18.260 --> 03:23:20.701]  So that's the story.
[03:23:20.701 --> 03:23:28.764]  So all of this, where the market's going, what's going to happen, you can see what's going to happen and you can look at the markets now.
[03:23:28.764 --> 03:23:34.547]  They're up over 200 points, the Dow as we speak.
[03:23:34.547 --> 03:23:42.350]  The ones to really watch and where the world economy is going is what's going on in China, man.
[03:23:42.350 --> 03:23:46.612]  That Shanghai Index, man, the composite index, it's down
[03:23:47.571 --> 03:23:54.154]  Beyond bear territory, bear territory where they're hanging out at like 20% down, they're down over 30.
[03:23:54.154 --> 03:23:56.415]  And it just keeps getting worse.
[03:23:56.415 --> 03:24:06.999]  President Xi of China just came out today to encourage the country that things were going to get better.
[03:24:06.999 --> 03:24:14.962]  There is a lot of talk that the Chinese are devaluing their currency purposely so they could export more product.
[03:24:14.962 --> 03:24:16.243]  We disagree with that.
[03:24:16.243 --> 03:24:17.323]  We don't see that at all.
[03:24:18.388 --> 03:24:20.869]  Two reasons.
[03:24:20.869 --> 03:24:23.350]  Number one is imports.
[03:24:23.350 --> 03:24:25.890]  They import a lot of product.
[03:24:25.890 --> 03:24:30.612]  And if their currency goes down, it costs them more to buy that stuff.
[03:24:30.612 --> 03:24:34.873]  Yes, as the currencies go down, you can buy their stuff cheaper.
[03:24:34.873 --> 03:24:37.574]  If your dollar gets stronger, which it has.
[03:24:37.574 --> 03:24:42.316]  But, let's look at the entire situation in China.
[03:24:42.316 --> 03:24:46.817]  Eighty percent of China's gross domestic product
[03:24:48.945 --> 03:24:55.130]  Is by that 1.3 billion people spending money.
[03:24:55.130 --> 03:24:56.571]  Consumers.
[03:24:56.571 --> 03:24:59.493]  Here in the States, it's about two-thirds.
[03:24:59.493 --> 03:25:03.996]  So they don't want to see this thing go down, but it's going down.
[03:25:03.996 --> 03:25:08.699]  You're looking at direct infrastructure investment in China.
[03:25:08.699 --> 03:25:10.381]  1992 levels.
[03:25:10.381 --> 03:25:11.001]  That's right.
[03:25:11.001 --> 03:25:16.105]  1996, the total debt was, just to put it into perspective,
[03:25:16.636 --> 03:25:20.479]  It was about five, six hundred, nine hundred billion dollars.
[03:25:20.479 --> 03:25:24.043]  Today, it's over thirty trillion.
[03:25:24.043 --> 03:25:30.308]  China is the big issue here, as well as the emerging markets that are submerging.
[03:25:30.308 --> 03:25:36.714]  The United States is doing better than virtually any country, and of course of all the major countries.
[03:25:36.714 --> 03:25:41.618]  We're number one when it comes to the stock markets and the growth in the economy.
[03:25:42.611 --> 03:25:52.398]  Of course, a lot of it has to do with the stock buybacks that boosted the markets up and they keep accelerating along with the tax cuts that made that happen.
[03:25:52.398 --> 03:25:56.000]  But looking at China is the big issue to look at.
[03:25:56.000 --> 03:26:02.525]  The gross domestic product grew this last quarter at its slowest rate since 2009.
[03:26:02.525 --> 03:26:06.668]  The panic of 08, 2009, things were not so cheery.
[03:26:06.668 --> 03:26:06.788]  So,
[03:26:12.011 --> 03:26:23.695]  Going back to the United States and the midterms, we don't think it's going to have much effect on the markets at all, regardless of who wins tomorrow.
[03:26:23.695 --> 03:26:31.098]  The other factor being that it's bigger than that.
[03:26:31.098 --> 03:26:33.278]  It's interest rates.
[03:26:33.278 --> 03:26:36.800]  So here's what we have to say about that.
[03:26:36.800 --> 03:26:38.120]  Trump will still be president.
[03:26:39.361 --> 03:26:50.010]  And we think there's going to be more and more pressure from President Trump on the Federal Reserve to keep interest rates down.
[03:26:50.010 --> 03:26:52.752]  Can the president have that power?
[03:26:52.752 --> 03:27:00.058]  Well, you saw what happened with Paul Volcker, right?
[03:27:00.058 --> 03:27:02.820]  Remember that?
[03:27:02.820 --> 03:27:05.562]  Just came out with his new book.
[03:27:05.562 --> 03:27:08.725]  He had to meet with
[03:27:10.930 --> 03:27:18.712]  President Reagan and Chief of Staff James Baker at the White House.
[03:27:18.712 --> 03:27:24.254]  But they brought him into the library, he said, because they didn't think it was taping anything there.
[03:27:24.254 --> 03:27:39.458]  And Reagan just sat there and Baker said to Paul Volcker, you have an order from the president not to raise interest rates before election day.
[03:27:39.458 --> 03:27:40.458]  Remember, Paul Volcker
[03:27:40.794 --> 03:27:43.276]  He's a Federal Reserve Chair.
[03:27:43.276 --> 03:27:43.837]  The U.S.
[03:27:43.837 --> 03:27:53.025]  Treasury Secretary, Mnuchin, whoever it is at the time, could fire the Fed Chair.
[03:27:53.025 --> 03:28:08.438]  So going back to the economy in the midterm elections, we don't believe that it's going to make much difference who wins tomorrow, because the power of the presidency
[03:28:08.988 --> 03:28:11.549]  Still remains in Trump's hands.
[03:28:11.549 --> 03:28:15.211]  Oh, and let's not forget, folks.
[03:28:15.211 --> 03:28:27.078]  Remember how the Democrats got wiped out in 2010 after the fraud Obama came into office?
[03:28:27.078 --> 03:28:29.299]  We're going to be back in a little bit.
[03:28:29.299 --> 03:28:32.101]  We're going to see what's going to happen next.
[03:28:32.101 --> 03:28:38.084]  If they lose the House, state governments around the country will be back in a few.
[03:28:40.448 --> 03:28:45.284]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic.
[03:28:45.284 --> 03:28:46.769]  It's Alex Jones!
[03:28:53.148 --> 03:28:56.730]  The pain in my neck, back, and shoulders has really gotten worse.
[03:28:56.730 --> 03:29:00.312]  Relief for body pain is here with Sunny Bay Heating Pads.
[03:29:00.312 --> 03:29:02.453]  Well, the last thing I want is to take another pill.

[03:31:53.632 --> 03:32:02.922]  The globalists know that if they suppress the good halogen and pump the environment full of the bad halogens, fluoride, chlorine, bromine, you name it, that it lowers IQ.
[03:32:02.922 --> 03:32:05.805]  It literally dumbs the population down.
[03:32:05.805 --> 03:32:11.852]  And on our quest to bring our listeners and viewers the best iodine in the world, we've gone through two permutations.
[03:32:12.512 --> 03:32:18.758]  First, seaweed-based iodine that was pretty good but hard to source, and the Globeless tried to block us getting a supply of it.
[03:32:18.758 --> 03:32:25.063]  So we discovered deep-earth crystals of pure nascent iodine and brought you X2 that's been incredible.
[03:32:25.063 --> 03:32:31.989]  Now, due to the Establisher trying to block that, we did more research and secured more of the deep-earth crystals of nascent iodine.
[03:32:33.130 --> 03:32:46.158]  Chemists, scientists, and others showed us the research that by combining it with three other compounds, two forms of iodine and vitamin C, it supercharges it and makes it even more bioavailable.
[03:32:46.158 --> 03:32:50.401]  Ladies and gentlemen, you want to research it, you want to see it, it's an incredible discovery.
[03:32:50.401 --> 03:32:57.185]  X3, now available at m4slife.com.
[03:32:57.185 --> 03:32:59.807]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:16.803 --> 03:33:22.347]  Hi, this is Gerald Cilenti sitting in for Alex Jones, hosting this next half hour.

[03:33:49.238 --> 03:33:59.886]  Of course, we just did a big story on censorship again in the latest edition of the Trends Journal that just came out, TrendsJournal.com.
[03:33:59.886 --> 03:34:05.310]  And I mention this because it's so important to keep free speech free and alive.

[03:35:14.317 --> 03:35:17.998]  I mentioned before about interest rates.
[03:35:17.998 --> 03:35:20.419]  They can't go higher.
[03:35:20.419 --> 03:35:22.339]  Here's why.
[03:35:22.339 --> 03:35:29.101]  This whole post-panic-of-08 boom was juiced by cheap money.
[03:35:29.101 --> 03:35:31.201]  Zero and negative interest rate policy.
[03:35:31.201 --> 03:35:32.502]  You've heard me say this and others.
[03:35:34.184 --> 03:35:40.488]  Times, a thousand times, and you can see it in the numbers.
[03:35:40.488 --> 03:35:44.350]  Take a look at what's going on in the housing market.
[03:35:44.350 --> 03:35:56.016]  Over there in California, and I was a young guy in the trends business, beginning it back in the 1980s, they used to say, you know, the trends begin out in California, move their way east.
[03:35:56.016 --> 03:36:00.839]  No, they don't, but they believe that, but some did, and some do.
[03:36:00.839 --> 03:36:03.160]  And one of them to watch is housing.
[03:36:05.695 --> 03:36:12.937]  Southern California, man, numbers are dropping heavy when interest rates for mortgages hit 5%.
[03:36:12.937 --> 03:36:25.879]  New home sales, existing home sales, new mortgage applications, the amount of new listings going on.
[03:36:25.879 --> 03:36:31.020]  Not only Southern California, way up there in Silicon Valley.
[03:36:31.020 --> 03:36:32.761]  That's the perfect name for it.
[03:36:32.761 --> 03:36:33.981]  Silicon, right?
[03:36:34.938 --> 03:36:43.025]  Silicon con men and women, gotta be equal here, con men and con women.
[03:36:43.025 --> 03:36:46.188]  Silicon, that's all they are.
[03:36:46.188 --> 03:36:50.672]  Anyway, things aren't going so good up there either.
[03:36:50.672 --> 03:36:54.475]  Can't take higher interest rates.
[03:36:54.475 --> 03:36:59.580]  Look at the home building sector.
[03:36:59.580 --> 03:37:00.821]  Look at the stocks.
[03:37:03.075 --> 03:37:06.616]  They're way deep into bear territory, down way over 20%.
[03:37:06.616 --> 03:37:19.941]  Hey, today Lowe's just announced they're closing a bunch of stores in Canada and the USA.
[03:37:19.941 --> 03:37:22.142]  It's slowing down.
[03:37:22.142 --> 03:37:26.004]  We're calling this a stage one recession.
[03:37:26.004 --> 03:37:31.566]  We don't buy the little propaganda that the government puts out, tells you when you're in a recession.
[03:37:31.566 --> 03:37:32.146]  The motto,
[03:37:33.090 --> 03:37:37.171]  The Trends Journalist, think for yourself.
[03:37:37.171 --> 03:37:43.794]  If the real estate market starts going down, the whole thing starts unraveling below it.
[03:37:43.794 --> 03:37:46.535]  Because of all the sectors that are related.
[03:37:46.535 --> 03:37:48.675]  Oh, like a Lowe's.
[03:37:48.675 --> 03:37:51.536]  And Lowe's goes lower.
[03:37:51.536 --> 03:37:55.578]  And then you look at the stock numbers that are coming out.
[03:37:55.578 --> 03:37:59.739]  Oh, you know, Starbucks.
[03:37:59.739 --> 03:38:01.540]  There's a story right here in the paper.
[03:38:02.383 --> 03:38:07.525]  They just had to announce that it gets jolt from robust sales.
[03:38:07.525 --> 03:38:16.849]  You know what the robust sales were?
[03:38:16.849 --> 03:38:29.675]  Growth came entirely from a 5% rise in the average ticket for the period.
[03:38:29.675 --> 03:38:31.116]  The number of transactions
[03:38:32.054 --> 03:38:37.496]  In the US fell 1% from a year earlier.
[03:38:37.496 --> 03:38:47.660]  Higher prices help Starbucks deliver its strongest quarterly sales gain in more than a year.
[03:38:47.660 --> 03:38:55.143]  Higher prices, not greater sales.
[03:38:55.143 --> 03:38:57.604]  Facebook, less people
[03:38:59.961 --> 03:39:00.861]  Numbers go up.
[03:39:00.861 --> 03:39:01.401]  Wait a minute.
[03:39:01.401 --> 03:39:02.502]  You're losing audience.
[03:39:02.502 --> 03:39:03.822]  Twitter.
[03:39:03.822 --> 03:39:06.382]  Losing audience.
[03:39:06.382 --> 03:39:08.903]  How can their stocks go up?
[03:39:08.903 --> 03:39:11.064]  General Motors.
[03:39:11.064 --> 03:39:12.864]  Selling less cars.
[03:39:12.864 --> 03:39:16.265]  Oh yeah, but the ones we're selling, people are paying more for.
[03:39:16.265 --> 03:39:18.845]  That drove our revenue.
[03:39:18.845 --> 03:39:26.147]  It's one company after another that's reporting this kind of news.
[03:39:27.722 --> 03:39:43.869]  So you can see the facts and the fiction behind it, because the reality is companies splurge on stock repurchases.
[03:39:43.869 --> 03:39:49.291]  We were the first magazine to call the Trump rally.
[03:39:49.291 --> 03:39:50.932]  Let's go back to election day, 2016.
[03:39:59.264 --> 03:40:06.249]  When it showed that Trump was going to win, those markets fell.
[03:40:06.249 --> 03:40:10.793]  The pre-open markets were down 800 points.
[03:40:10.793 --> 03:40:19.180]  Within hours, they did a 180 and went way up.
[03:40:19.180 --> 03:40:23.063]  We said, this is the beginning of the Trump rally.
[03:40:23.063 --> 03:40:25.504]  Coined the term.
[03:40:25.504 --> 03:40:26.045]  All throughout 2017,
[03:40:28.325 --> 03:40:30.506]  Trump rally continued.
[03:40:30.506 --> 03:40:36.190]  February, we forecast a market correction, and it did.
[03:40:36.190 --> 03:40:38.992]  We said the end of the Trump rally.
[03:40:38.992 --> 03:40:43.795]  The markets will continue to grow at a moderate pace.
[03:40:43.795 --> 03:40:47.918]  But again, here's what's doing it.
[03:40:47.918 --> 03:40:53.362]  Companies are splurging on stock buybacks.
[03:40:53.362 --> 03:40:56.284]  This is the weekend edition of
[03:40:58.012 --> 03:40:59.933]  The Wall Street Journal.
[03:40:59.933 --> 03:41:12.418]  Net buybacks in the month totaled just $12 billion by October 19th, but jumped to $39 billion by October 29th.
[03:41:12.418 --> 03:41:24.203]  That is more than the $30 billion recorded in September, and just under the $48 billion recorded in August.
[03:41:24.203 --> 03:41:25.783]  Let's go back now.
[03:41:25.783 --> 03:41:27.744]  Remember the markets were going down in October?
[03:41:29.355 --> 03:41:30.635]  All of a sudden, boom!
[03:41:30.635 --> 03:41:33.796]  A surge of stock buybacks.
[03:41:33.796 --> 03:41:36.937]  That's pulling stocks off the market.
[03:41:36.937 --> 03:41:40.238]  Supply and demand drives up the price.
[03:41:40.238 --> 03:41:42.999]  There's another thing pushing prices up.
[03:41:42.999 --> 03:41:47.480]  They're doing it in China, and you can bet they're going to do it in the United States.
[03:41:47.480 --> 03:41:50.961]  The United States has the Plunge Protection Team.
[03:41:50.961 --> 03:41:53.422]  Big story in the Trends Journal about that.
[03:41:53.422 --> 03:41:55.142]  Created during the Reagan administration.
[03:41:56.480 --> 03:42:00.804]  Stocks go down, they go in and buy them up, bring them back the price up.
[03:42:00.804 --> 03:42:04.787]  Over in China, they got the national team.
[03:42:04.787 --> 03:42:07.789]  And the national team there has been very active.
[03:42:07.789 --> 03:42:17.778]  Buying up stock, and they're still not very successful in what they're doing there, even though they're buying them back and buying them up.
[03:42:17.778 --> 03:42:20.560]  So, we're on shaky ground here.
[03:42:22.671 --> 03:42:31.958]  As I mentioned before, when Alex was on during the Clinton administration, they used to say, if you wanted to run for office, it's the economy, stupid.
[03:42:31.958 --> 03:42:35.580]  Now, it's interest rates, stupid.
[03:42:35.580 --> 03:42:37.542]  We'll be back in a little bit.
[03:42:37.542 --> 03:42:39.243]  Thanks for tuning in.
[03:42:39.243 --> 03:42:40.684]  Put your money where your heart is.
[03:42:40.684 --> 03:42:42.726]  Buy some product.
[03:42:42.726 --> 03:42:46.728]  I'm in for it.

[03:43:59.215 --> 03:44:02.157]  And that's what I'm talking about at InfoWarsStore.com.

[03:44:29.535 --> 03:44:33.537]  They've got three-month supplies, year supplies, week emergency supplies.

[03:45:07.236 --> 03:45:22.766]  $25, $50, $100, $250, or even $500 would be a godsend to our important work here to beat back the globalists and to destroy their campaign of censorship in which they want to strangle our First Amendment rights.
[03:45:23.911 --> 03:45:27.752]  Hey, how would you like to take InfoWars with you wherever you go?

[03:45:55.845 --> 03:46:01.508]  We need to go back and revisit the foundations of our freedom.
[03:46:01.508 --> 03:46:04.629]  Our freedoms don't consist of the things that are enumerated on a piece of paper.
[03:46:04.629 --> 03:46:07.310]  It consists of the things that we're willing to fight for.
[03:46:07.310 --> 03:46:11.592]  The First Amendment, the Bill of Rights, the rest of the Bill of Rights are prohibitions.
[03:46:11.592 --> 03:46:18.976]  They're prohibitions against powerful organizations and individuals taking those God-given rights from us as individuals.
[03:46:18.976 --> 03:46:21.517]  You better understand that because they're taking them right now.
[03:46:24.941 --> 03:46:27.162]  We have seen what they want to do.
[03:46:27.162 --> 03:46:30.203]  They called it UN Agenda 21, now they call it the UN 2030 Agenda.
[03:46:30.203 --> 03:46:42.109]  They want everybody off of the rural lands, they want people out of the suburbs, they want to pack everybody into the cities, because that's where it is easiest for them to control everyone.
[03:46:42.109 --> 03:46:44.390]  It's the David Knight Show!
[03:46:44.390 --> 03:46:46.811]  Never miss your show, any day.
[03:46:46.811 --> 03:46:48.412]  I mean, what?
[03:46:48.412 --> 03:46:49.052]  I mean, never!
[03:46:57.138 --> 03:46:59.791]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:19.122 --> 03:47:22.103]  Hey, this is Gerald Cilenti sitting with Alex Jones.
[03:47:22.103 --> 03:47:24.983]  Always great being on InfoWars.
[03:47:24.983 --> 03:47:28.284]  I just heard David Knight, love being on with him as well.
[03:47:28.284 --> 03:47:36.346]  And remember, do what you can to keep the voice of freedom and liberty alive as they try to steal it from us.
[03:47:36.346 --> 03:47:40.567]  And again, you guys know I'm a political... and women, we gotta be equal here, guys.
[03:47:40.567 --> 03:47:41.507]  Women.
[03:47:41.507 --> 03:47:42.747]  Can't say gals.
[03:47:42.747 --> 03:47:44.688]  Say guys, we can't say gals.
[03:47:44.688 --> 03:47:45.468]  Guys and women.
[03:47:46.607 --> 03:47:49.108]  There's nothing correct, by the way, about politically correct.
[03:47:49.108 --> 03:47:51.529]  Look up the definition of a politician.
[03:47:51.529 --> 03:47:57.652]  Someone who's manipulative and devious, typically to gain advancement within an organization.
[03:47:57.652 --> 03:47:58.793]  That's the definition.
[03:47:58.793 --> 03:48:06.597]  So anyway, it's up to you to keep the voice of freedom alive and do what you can
[03:48:07.412 --> 03:48:14.398]  To support InfoWars and all the great programming that they do, the great guests that they bring on here.
[03:48:14.398 --> 03:48:22.726]  And their InfoWars 67% off blowout sale is a blowout that you better take advantage of.
[03:48:22.726 --> 03:48:27.871]  I mean, I'm just hearing that they're going to be... This is the end of super male vitality?
[03:48:27.871 --> 03:48:33.115]  What am I going to use to keep that boogie alive and keep going?
[03:48:33.115 --> 03:48:33.756]  Not a lot.
[03:48:34.418 --> 03:48:41.884]  So I'm going to buy as much as I can of this, because when it runs out, where are you going to go for it?
[03:48:41.884 --> 03:48:45.487]  So do what you can to keep InfoWars alive.
[03:48:45.487 --> 03:48:51.131]  Buy their wonderful products with this 67% off blowout sale.
[03:48:51.131 --> 03:48:53.473]  What else do they have here?
[03:48:53.473 --> 03:48:58.697]  Oh, they have the Brain Force Plus, now available.
[03:48:58.697 --> 03:48:59.938]  Survival Shield X3.
[03:49:01.682 --> 03:49:05.905]  Alex Pure Pro Water Filtration System.
[03:49:05.905 --> 03:49:10.068]  Boy, that's something everybody needs, man.
[03:49:10.068 --> 03:49:12.169]  The poison water around this country.
[03:49:12.169 --> 03:49:23.337]  I was just reading something coming out from Wisconsin up there about the 3M plant out there that allegedly has poisoned the water for people.
[03:49:24.062 --> 03:49:39.496]  I mean, with all the poisons in the water, you want this filtration system and all these other products to keep you healthy, happy, jumping and alive and to keep Alex Jones and the crew out there and all the great guests.
[03:49:39.496 --> 03:49:47.884]  And when you get to hear a guy like Roger Stone and all these others that he has on there that speak the truth in their hearts rather than
[03:49:48.186 --> 03:49:55.792]  But the prostitutes do get paid to put out by their corporate whores and their Washington whoremasters.
[03:49:55.792 --> 03:50:04.539]  I want to stand back on the economy a bit because I was mentioning before I said to Alex, it's the economy, Stu, but that's what people care the most about.
[03:50:04.539 --> 03:50:15.989]  When it hurts them in their pocketbook and you're looking at, you know, numbers coming out, student loan debt is crushing millennials, how renters are taking it harder than
[03:50:16.986 --> 03:50:23.070]  People living in their own homes, one piece of data coming out after another.
[03:50:23.070 --> 03:50:30.195]  And I was reading about stock buybacks and talking about stock buybacks and how this is generating the future of the market.
[03:50:30.195 --> 03:50:33.518]  So it goes back to interest rates.
[03:50:33.518 --> 03:50:37.901]  It allows them to borrow cheaply in the tax cuts so they could buy back.
[03:50:37.901 --> 03:50:41.383]  If interest rates go up, this economy goes down.
[03:50:41.383 --> 03:50:42.084]  End of story.
[03:50:44.218 --> 03:50:48.619]  It has nothing to do, by the way, with tariffs or trade wars.
[03:50:48.619 --> 03:50:51.340]  That is so much BS.
[03:50:51.340 --> 03:51:02.443]  When you add the tariffs that Trump has put on China, they amount to 0.7% of China's GDP.
[03:51:02.443 --> 03:51:03.963]  Nothing.
[03:51:03.963 --> 03:51:08.424]  Meanwhile, hey, the United States just had another record-breaking trade deficit.
[03:51:09.704 --> 03:51:20.806]  Who would do business like this when you're dealing with a country that makes $375 billion more than you do in merchandise trade?
[03:51:20.806 --> 03:51:22.447]  And you're supposed to take it?
[03:51:22.447 --> 03:51:26.927]  The media should be 100% behind Trump.
[03:51:26.927 --> 03:51:33.109]  But again, the media is not because Clinton is paying back the Democrats for the deregulation.
[03:51:33.109 --> 03:51:36.189]  That's why they're going after Trump, as we see it.
[03:51:36.189 --> 03:51:39.510]  Anyway, cosmetic firm Estee Lauder.
[03:51:40.839 --> 03:51:47.383]  Whose shares have dropped by as much as 14% during October.
[03:51:47.383 --> 03:51:58.349]  On Wednesday, announced plans to buy back 40 million shares, or 11% of its total outstanding.
[03:51:58.349 --> 03:52:00.991]  So you saw the markets going down.
[03:52:00.991 --> 03:52:04.933]  This is what's driving them up.
[03:52:04.933 --> 03:52:08.535]  Past week, International Business Machines Corp.
[03:52:09.628 --> 03:52:17.029]  Four billion dollars worth of buybacks.
[03:52:17.029 --> 03:52:31.452]  And financial exchanges operator, Intercontinental Exchange, Inc., announced a plan for repurchases worth two billion dollars.
[03:52:31.452 --> 03:52:37.493]  Elsewhere, Netherlands-based Royal Dutch Shell, two billion dollars on buybacks.
[03:52:38.550 --> 03:52:44.352]  Between July 26th and October 19th.
[03:52:44.352 --> 03:52:50.275]  On Thursday, it launched a second round.
[03:52:50.275 --> 03:52:53.756]  2.5 billion.
[03:52:53.756 --> 03:52:54.837]  All right?
[03:52:54.837 --> 03:52:58.018]  This is what's driving the markets back up.
[03:52:58.018 --> 03:53:04.521]  That, we don't know if the plunge protection there is plunging it up, but I would suggest so.
[03:53:04.521 --> 03:53:04.561]  So.
[03:53:10.984 --> 03:53:15.447]  They're boosting the value of their stocks.
[03:53:15.447 --> 03:53:19.209]  Story out today, Financial Times.
[03:53:19.209 --> 03:53:26.073]  Buffett's $1 billion buyback points to dearth of attractive deals.
[03:53:26.073 --> 03:53:28.815]  They bought a billion dollars worth of stock buybacks.
[03:53:28.815 --> 03:53:36.079]  Other companies and buyout firms have pushed deal-making to heady levels.
[03:53:36.079 --> 03:53:39.361]  Some $3.5 trillion of acquisitions
[03:53:40.330 --> 03:53:53.942]  Have been agreed this year up more than 30% from a year earlier.
[03:53:53.942 --> 03:53:58.306]  That's what's driving equities up.
[03:53:58.306 --> 03:54:01.548]  Stock buybacks merger and acquisition activity.
[03:54:01.548 --> 03:54:03.070]  How do you do it?
[03:54:03.070 --> 03:54:05.632]  Cheap money.
[03:54:05.632 --> 03:54:07.473]  Cheap money.
[03:54:07.473 --> 03:54:08.034]  Funny money.
[03:54:08.888 --> 03:54:11.629]  So they're going to keep interest rates low, we believe.
[03:54:11.629 --> 03:54:14.551]  And that'll keep the markets going.
[03:54:14.551 --> 03:54:19.953]  In the absence of that, we're going to see a stage one recession.
[03:54:19.953 --> 03:54:25.676]  You don't have to wait for two quarters of negative GDP with these phony numbers they make up.
[03:54:25.676 --> 03:54:28.017]  Watch housing.
[03:54:28.017 --> 03:54:30.298]  You know, some other trends we'll talk about here.
[03:54:30.298 --> 03:54:35.100]  You know, there's a lot of talk about these driverless cars.
[03:54:35.100 --> 03:54:37.121]  Now, we say that's a driverless cliff.
[03:54:38.285 --> 03:54:39.746]  Big story out today.
[03:54:39.746 --> 03:54:44.707]  You know, uh, what do we got here?
[03:54:44.707 --> 03:54:47.608]  Uber pledges self-driving safety.
[03:54:47.608 --> 03:54:57.092]  There's about 45 million recalls.
[03:54:57.092 --> 03:55:00.133]  Just in the last couple of weeks, you saw a bunch of them coming in.
[03:55:01.966 --> 03:55:04.388]  That's just in the United States.
[03:55:04.388 --> 03:55:09.972]  2016, there were 50 million recalls.
[03:55:09.972 --> 03:55:13.055]  And it takes forever to get these recalls fixed, by the way.
[03:55:13.055 --> 03:55:16.237]  They're showing some of them now.
[03:55:16.237 --> 03:55:19.500]  It's going to take, like, if you bring it in, it's going to take over a day to get fixed.
[03:55:19.500 --> 03:55:29.647]  So you're going to tell me you're going to have a driverless car, and you can't get the ignition switches, brakes, and other minor issues fixed?
[03:55:29.647 --> 03:55:31.669]  They're becoming too technology driven.
[03:55:33.806 --> 03:55:42.112]  You know, there was that saying that the meek shall inherit the earth, according to the King James Bible.
[03:55:42.112 --> 03:55:51.639]  One of our top trends for 2019 is that the geeks have inherited the earth.
[03:55:51.639 --> 03:55:57.543]  Could you imagine these soulless, cold cats and kittens
[03:55:59.614 --> 03:56:23.372]  That look like nothing, speak like nothing, act like nothing, not a drop of passion, not a ounce of boogie, or a drip of John, censoring everybody that they don't like.
[03:56:23.372 --> 03:56:27.815]  Having you not think for yourself, but ask Alexa, oh, hey,
[03:56:28.408 --> 03:56:30.769]  See that new story that came out?
[03:56:30.769 --> 03:56:31.670]  Probably didn't.
[03:56:31.670 --> 03:56:35.692]  It was on the back pages of the paper over the weekend.
[03:56:35.692 --> 03:56:38.093]  Yeah, them cell phones, that radiation.
[03:56:38.093 --> 03:56:38.714]  Woof!
[03:56:38.714 --> 03:56:41.495]  Microwaves.
[03:56:41.495 --> 03:56:43.216]  Boy, hey guys.
[03:56:43.216 --> 03:56:45.457]  Keep that cell phone in your pocket.
[03:56:45.457 --> 03:56:49.259]  You better take more of this super male vitality, man.
[03:56:49.259 --> 03:56:51.581]  You better pump it up.
[03:56:51.581 --> 03:56:54.082]  Because it's gonna knock it down.
[03:56:54.082 --> 03:56:54.962]  I don't have a cell phone.
[03:56:54.962 --> 03:56:56.003]  I don't carry one.
[03:56:56.003 --> 03:56:57.044]  When I travel, I do.
[03:56:57.044 --> 03:56:57.704]  Got one on the car.
[03:56:58.689 --> 03:57:01.191]  In case your car breaks, something happens, you know.
[03:57:01.191 --> 03:57:03.694]  But I don't carry one of those things.
[03:57:03.694 --> 03:57:05.415]  Yeah, the study came out.
[03:57:05.415 --> 03:57:06.536]  Buried.
[03:57:06.536 --> 03:57:08.558]  Buried.
[03:57:08.558 --> 03:57:14.183]  So, going back, the geeks have inherited the earth.
[03:57:14.183 --> 03:57:17.606]  They've taught us how to stop thinking for ourselves.
[03:57:17.606 --> 03:57:21.110]  So if you want to think for yourself, consider getting the Trends Journal.
[03:57:21.110 --> 03:57:22.371]  Trendsjournal.com.
[03:57:23.095 --> 03:57:24.836]  TrendsJournal.com.
[03:57:24.836 --> 03:57:26.858]  History before it happens.
[03:57:26.858 --> 03:57:32.062]  And keep supporting Alex Jones and the InfoWar Warriors.
[03:57:32.062 --> 03:57:34.003]  Put your money where your heart is.
[03:57:34.003 --> 03:57:43.170]  So long.
[03:57:43.170 --> 03:57:47.113]  Words cannot describe how big the stakes are for the future of humanity right now.
[03:57:48.419 --> 03:57:57.102]  InfoWars is being openly targeted by the Democratic Party, leftist CIA operatives, the corrupt Justice Department, and the entire Soros crime syndicate.
[03:57:57.102 --> 03:57:59.103]  People say, why would you start a fight with them?
[03:57:59.103 --> 03:58:02.544]  Because they were already dominating and running America into the ground.
[03:58:02.544 --> 03:58:05.165]  And I knew we had no future if we didn't do this.
[03:58:05.165 --> 03:58:07.446]  So we've already had incredible success.
[03:58:07.446 --> 03:58:14.409]  But if you will simply realize how epic this is, and understand how real this fight is, and why we've been made the main target,
[03:58:14.949 --> 03:58:24.735]  And if you financially support us, and if you spread the word about our articles and videos at InfoWars.com, we won't just continue to stand up against these brutal scumbags.
[03:58:24.735 --> 03:58:25.936]  We'll win.
[03:58:25.936 --> 03:58:28.838]  We have huge sales at InfoWarsStore.com right now.
[03:58:28.838 --> 03:58:35.983]  And we're still able to operate the shopping carts, get stuff shipped out to you, despite the fact we're trying to block our commerce, and your right to the market.
[03:58:35.983 --> 03:58:39.685]  But if you don't stand up and support us financially, Soros the Globalist may win.
[03:58:39.685 --> 03:58:41.246]  This is InfoWars Darkness Hour.
[03:58:41.246 --> 03:58:42.107]  We need your support.
[03:58:42.107 --> 03:58:42.647]  I'm counting on you.
[03:58:44.252 --> 03:58:48.515]  Please, whatever you do, realize that we're all getting punched drunk to the censorship.
[03:58:48.515 --> 03:58:51.977]  And you saw 18 Twitter accounts, they say, affiliated with InfoWars.
[03:58:51.977 --> 03:58:53.739]  Yeah, some of them are like little side accounts.
[03:58:53.739 --> 03:58:57.161]  They know we had like InfoWars store that just showed our products.
[03:58:57.161 --> 03:59:03.805]  They just banned them all yesterday in punishment that I be at a Trump rally and be mobbed by all these folks that loved us.
[03:59:03.805 --> 03:59:08.889]  Your excitement about America, your excitement about this broadcast is what brought the country and the world back from the brink.
[03:59:09.229 --> 03:59:15.334]  But the globalists now want to target where the resistance came from, so that we're not pesky in the future.
[03:59:15.334 --> 03:59:18.317]  I want to be troublesome and pesky.
[03:59:18.317 --> 03:59:19.398]  I want to keep going.
[03:59:19.398 --> 03:59:23.241]  I want to make them do the ultimate, not just destroy us financially.
[03:59:23.241 --> 03:59:25.262]  I want to push all the way.
[03:59:25.262 --> 03:59:26.543]  I've committed to do that.
[03:59:26.543 --> 03:59:27.624]  I've prayed for that.
[03:59:27.624 --> 03:59:29.286]  And I've been told that's going to happen.
[03:59:29.286 --> 03:59:31.708]  But you've got to back us, and I promise you this.
[03:59:32.188 --> 03:59:33.329]  I will never falter.
[03:59:33.329 --> 03:59:35.850]  I will never waver at the spiritual level.
[03:59:35.850 --> 03:59:36.790]  I physically will.
[03:59:36.790 --> 03:59:46.654]  But I give you my commitment, if you financially support us, then fullershore.com to give you my absolute total commitment.
[03:59:46.654 --> 03:59:49.275]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
