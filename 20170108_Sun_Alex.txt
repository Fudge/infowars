[00:00.000 --> 00:18.960]  Live from the InfoWars.com Studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:18.960 --> 00:20.600]  Welcome to the Alex Jones radio show.
[00:20.600 --> 00:27.160]  I'm David Knight on this Sunday, January the 8th, 2017, or about 11 days out from President
[00:27.160 --> 00:29.880]  Elect Trump becoming President.
[00:29.880 --> 00:31.120]  A lot of things on the menu today.
[00:31.120 --> 00:37.600]  I want to take a look at eight years ago because we had a real leading light in the cause of
[00:37.600 --> 00:38.600]  Liberty Die.
[00:38.600 --> 00:43.120]  You can see a couple of articles linked on the Dredge Report today at Nat Hintoff.
[00:43.120 --> 00:47.480]  And of course, one of the articles that was linked there was one that was done back in,
[00:47.480 --> 00:53.200]  I think it was 1999, said the last honest or real liberal.
[00:53.200 --> 00:55.600]  And they talked about the different positions that he'd taken.
[00:55.600 --> 00:59.240]  They talked about how he was unafraid to stand up for individual liberty.
[00:59.240 --> 01:03.520]  He was unafraid of being singled out and attacked.
[01:03.520 --> 01:09.320]  And I want to talk about an op-ed piece that he had almost exactly eight years ago, January
[01:09.320 --> 01:10.320]  the 7th, 2007.
[01:10.320 --> 01:14.360]  He talked about Obama's Black Widow, so that's going to be coming up in the show.
[01:14.360 --> 01:19.000]  He was talking about the surveillance state and what was going to happen with the surveillance
[01:19.000 --> 01:20.000]  state.
[01:20.000 --> 01:25.760]  He had a horrific terrorist attack again, this time again, with a truck.
[01:25.760 --> 01:27.080]  This was in Jerusalem.
[01:27.080 --> 01:34.760]  They had a truck driver drive over a group of young soldiers who were engaged in a tourist
[01:34.760 --> 01:35.760]  sightseeing tour.
[01:35.760 --> 01:40.680]  They had just gotten off of the bus and they were run over by this truck and then he put
[01:40.680 --> 01:45.200]  it in reverse and backed over them until they killed him.
[01:45.200 --> 01:47.680]  And we know what's going to happen with this.
[01:47.680 --> 01:52.280]  Rather than taking precautions that are going to get people, and you can see the video running
[01:52.280 --> 01:58.000]  there in the background as we're talking here, if you're watching this broadcast.
[01:58.000 --> 01:59.000]  Very disturbing video.
[01:59.000 --> 02:02.960]  But of course, what is equally disturbing is to think about the way the government is
[02:02.960 --> 02:07.600]  going to respond to these attacks now that are coming not only with guns, but of course
[02:07.600 --> 02:11.560]  with trucks, with anything that they can get a hold of.
[02:11.560 --> 02:13.320]  What will the government do?
[02:13.320 --> 02:14.320]  Will it do the obvious thing?
[02:14.320 --> 02:19.920]  Will it arrest people or do vetting on people and not bring people in unless they know who
[02:19.920 --> 02:21.320]  they are?
[02:21.320 --> 02:26.040]  If they can't vet these people, then you don't get to come in to the country, okay?
[02:26.040 --> 02:27.360]  You don't get to come in and live.
[02:27.360 --> 02:29.280]  That's what Donald Trump said.
[02:29.280 --> 02:34.600]  And that was what he was excoriated about, called a xenophobe and so forth.
[02:34.600 --> 02:38.640]  But of course, these same people who are pushing that, they're now saying, we got to do everything
[02:38.640 --> 02:41.000]  we can to escalate a Cold War with the Russians.
[02:41.000 --> 02:46.160]  So whenever we see a problem, we always need to examine that problem.
[02:46.160 --> 02:50.520]  So we're going to take another look today at the people who say that they have now settled
[02:50.520 --> 02:52.920]  this, that the Russians did hack our election.
[02:52.920 --> 02:53.920]  No, they didn't.
[02:53.920 --> 02:57.720]  And we're going to give you some feedback from some technical people who know what they're
[02:57.720 --> 02:59.040]  talking about.
[02:59.040 --> 03:03.280]  It is laughable what the government is selling us and telling us is proof.
[03:03.280 --> 03:09.520]  And when you see them doubling down on this and putting out a phony story that is patently
[03:09.520 --> 03:16.800]  absurd, and they keep repeating it nonstop, you know that they've got a long term plan
[03:16.800 --> 03:18.300]  in mind.
[03:18.300 --> 03:19.800]  Think about 9-11.
[03:19.800 --> 03:23.880]  We've got more evidence that our government, elements of our government were involved in
[03:23.880 --> 03:26.440]  9-11 than we do for this Russian hack.
[03:26.440 --> 03:27.920]  And we know what happened with that.
[03:27.920 --> 03:28.920]  We got the Patriot Act.
[03:28.920 --> 03:30.800]  We got the militarized police state.
[03:30.800 --> 03:36.720]  We got the escalated unconstitutional actions of the NSA that William Benny and others warned
[03:36.720 --> 03:42.600]  us about that Nat Hithoff warned us about as Barack Obama was about to become president.
[03:42.600 --> 03:44.120]  So what are they bringing to us now?
[03:44.120 --> 03:46.480]  Well, Alex Jones reported on that this weekend.
[03:46.480 --> 03:50.360]  He said, look, they're going to use this phony narrative about the Russians.
[03:50.360 --> 03:52.480]  It's not just about discrediting Donald Trump.
[03:52.480 --> 03:55.720]  Yes, that's a wonderful thing that they can do from their standpoint.
[03:55.720 --> 03:59.160]  They can use this as an effort to discredit Donald Trump.
[03:59.160 --> 04:04.080]  But the key thing that they're interested in doing is insinuating themselves into our
[04:04.080 --> 04:05.200]  electoral control.
[04:05.200 --> 04:09.600]  They're not saying that anybody hacked any machines.
[04:09.600 --> 04:10.600]  They're not saying that.
[04:10.600 --> 04:15.240]  But that's what the public is hearing when they talk about hacking.
[04:15.240 --> 04:20.200]  And I'm telling you, most of the public doesn't pay attention to the details.
[04:20.200 --> 04:21.840]  They only hear the headline.
[04:21.840 --> 04:25.360]  And they hear that headline repeated over and over and over again.
[04:25.360 --> 04:28.640]  That is the propaganda tool that makes it become true.
[04:28.640 --> 04:31.080]  That fixes it in their mind.
[04:31.080 --> 04:32.600]  So we're going to talk about that.
[04:32.600 --> 04:36.440]  We're going to give you an update on the Fort Lauderdale shooting and the gun control bills
[04:36.440 --> 04:39.760]  that were introduced, one to ban gun control.
[04:39.760 --> 04:43.440]  But another one would have allowed people to protect themselves.
[04:43.440 --> 04:45.960]  You think that's going to be dead on arrival now because of the shooting?
[04:45.960 --> 04:48.360]  And we'll talk about the background of that shooter.
[04:48.360 --> 04:49.360]  Stay with us.
[04:49.360 --> 04:59.000]  We'll be right back.
[04:59.000 --> 05:03.480]  I want to encourage all of you to remember how high the stakes really are right now in
[05:03.480 --> 05:04.480]  the battle for freedom.
[05:04.480 --> 05:06.480]  And the information war is paramount.
[05:06.480 --> 05:10.480]  That's why it's more important than ever that you spread the word about infowars.com
[05:10.480 --> 05:14.160]  and send out the links so people can watch the free feeds and get the free podcast and
[05:14.160 --> 05:18.400]  download the free iPhone and droid apps at infowars.com forward slash show.
[05:18.400 --> 05:23.200]  It is critical that we be able to email you when we're being cyber attacked or shut down.

[05:48.680 --> 05:52.840]  We also have daily specials, sometimes as much as 50% off for members of info wars
[05:52.840 --> 05:53.840]  prime.
[05:53.840 --> 06:14.040]  If you want answers, well, so does me, it's Alex Jones.
[06:14.040 --> 06:18.040]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones show.
[06:18.040 --> 06:22.680]  I'm David Knight, your host on this Sunday, January the 8th, 2017.
[06:22.680 --> 06:26.280]  Alex Jones will be joining us live in the second hour.
[06:26.280 --> 06:29.800]  Before we get to Alex, I want to talk about, of course, this terrorist attack that happened
[06:29.800 --> 06:33.000]  in Jerusalem, another truck attack.
[06:33.000 --> 06:35.100]  This is becoming very regular.
[06:35.100 --> 06:37.640]  What will the government do in response to this?
[06:37.640 --> 06:40.560]  Well, we've already seen what they're preparing to do.
[06:40.560 --> 06:44.800]  They're preparing to a kill switch for vehicles.
[06:44.800 --> 06:49.560]  We know that the government wants to control our transportation, and this is going to give
[06:49.560 --> 06:53.920]  them an excuse to start doing that sooner rather than later.
[06:53.920 --> 06:58.800]  Every time we see these types of attacks, we see the government moving in an effort
[06:58.800 --> 07:04.000]  to increase their control over us, moving in a direction to make us more dependent,
[07:04.000 --> 07:08.720]  more helpless on them, and to empower them over us.
[07:08.720 --> 07:13.480]  Every time we see something like this, whether it's real or whether it is set up, that is
[07:13.480 --> 07:14.600]  going to be the response.
[07:14.600 --> 07:16.760]  They're going to take freedom away from us.
[07:16.760 --> 07:18.720]  They're going to take things out of our hands.
[07:18.720 --> 07:24.640]  If we look at this shooting that happened in Fort Lauderdale, I want to remind you that
[07:24.640 --> 07:28.600]  there was a bill, right away when I put this out and we said, hey, this is looking kind
[07:28.600 --> 07:29.960]  of strange.
[07:29.960 --> 07:36.200]  This is a guy who walked into an FBI office, said that he was being forced to watch ISIS
[07:36.200 --> 07:37.200]  videos.
[07:37.200 --> 07:42.760]  He's being forced by the CIA to go fight for ISIS, walked into the FBI office and said
[07:42.760 --> 07:48.240]  that in Anchorage, Alaska, and then less than two months later, he's in Orlando.
[07:48.240 --> 07:53.520]  He checks in with no baggage except for his checked gun and flies to Orlando and starts
[07:53.520 --> 07:55.200]  shooting people.
[07:55.200 --> 08:01.120]  Now at the same time, we had people in Florida that were moving and looked like they were
[08:01.120 --> 08:08.040]  going to get this passed, moving to take away the banning of guns in certain areas, essentially
[08:08.040 --> 08:10.440]  making people defenseless.
[08:10.440 --> 08:15.400]  And I want to read you what was said about this, Monday of the week that this happened
[08:15.400 --> 08:19.800]  on Friday, the Tallahassee Democrats said on January the 3rd, they said gun advocates
[08:19.800 --> 08:22.560]  in Florida didn't take a break over the holiday weekend.
[08:22.560 --> 08:28.120]  Florida Open Carry began rallying its troops with a mass email in support of the most important
[08:28.120 --> 08:33.720]  pro-Second Amendment rights bill of the 2017 legislative session, they said.
[08:33.720 --> 08:38.520]  And this was a bill that would repeal forbidding guns on college campuses, forbidding guns
[08:38.520 --> 08:42.480]  in airport terminals, forbidding guns at government meetings.
[08:42.480 --> 08:46.600]  And it was introduced by Senator Greg Stowe, I think is the way he pronounces name, I'm
[08:46.600 --> 08:49.320]  not sure, it's S-T-E-U-B-E.
[08:49.320 --> 08:54.080]  Now they said that in the past, Campus Carry and Open Carry measures had died in the committee
[08:54.080 --> 08:58.280]  for the past two years because they were never even scheduled for a vote.
[08:58.280 --> 09:02.320]  However, they believed that this year would be different because the guy who introduced
[09:02.320 --> 09:04.800]  the bill was now the chair of the committee.
[09:04.800 --> 09:07.480]  So he was going to get that up for a vote.
[09:07.480 --> 09:11.120]  And this is what he had to say, the Senator who introduced this was spot on.
[09:11.120 --> 09:18.040]  Now these words were prophetic, this was said less than five days before the attack in Fort
[09:18.040 --> 09:19.040]  Lauderdale.
[09:19.040 --> 09:23.120]  He said, if you want to kill as many people as possible before the cops arrive, then you're
[09:23.120 --> 09:27.000]  likely to go to a place where law-abiding citizens cannot carry.
[09:27.000 --> 09:30.320]  That's what we've seen time and time again.
[09:30.320 --> 09:35.920]  That's why I think we shouldn't have them, we should not have government disarmament
[09:35.920 --> 09:40.080]  zones or killing zones as we have called them over and over again.
[09:40.080 --> 09:41.600]  So that was in the works.
[09:41.600 --> 09:47.320]  And interestingly enough, this guy didn't do a shooting in Alaska, instead he flew to
[09:47.320 --> 09:51.080]  Florida to do that, where that bill was pending.
[09:51.080 --> 09:56.240]  Just you find it interesting that even in a situation where there's as many police and
[09:56.240 --> 10:02.520]  TSA agents and law enforcement agencies you can find anywhere in the airport, the airport
[10:02.520 --> 10:08.960]  next to a prison represents what the government has as the ultimate ideal to keep us safe,
[10:08.960 --> 10:09.960]  isn't it?
[10:09.960 --> 10:15.080]  There's police and government agents everywhere, nobody carrying a firearm.
[10:15.080 --> 10:17.880]  That's what they think will make us safe, isn't it?
[10:17.880 --> 10:22.120]  No, it's not going to make us safe and we've just seen that time and again.
[10:22.120 --> 10:26.360]  And even in that kind of an environment, it took between one and two minutes for the police
[10:26.360 --> 10:27.560]  to respond to this guy.
[10:27.560 --> 10:34.400]  In that amount of time, he was able to shoot, reload, shoot, reload, shoot, and then they
[10:34.400 --> 10:35.480]  got there.
[10:35.480 --> 10:40.000]  Three magazines full of bullets in a crowded area.
[10:40.000 --> 10:43.840]  And so when we look at this, yes, real people died.
[10:43.840 --> 10:48.880]  Real people died because of their laws, because nobody is allowed to protect themselves.
[10:48.880 --> 10:55.680]  We've had Sheriff Clark from Milwaukee talking about the fact, hey, look, we'll do what we
[10:55.680 --> 10:57.040]  can to catch the bad guys.
[10:57.040 --> 10:59.800]  We'll do what we can to stop it as soon as possible.
[10:59.800 --> 11:01.120]  But we can't be everywhere.
[11:01.120 --> 11:02.880]  We can't be everywhere.
[11:02.880 --> 11:07.880]  See, even in prison, people die of drug overdoses because the drug war doesn't work.
[11:07.880 --> 11:13.880]  Even in prison, people are killed by inmates even in prison before the police can get there.
[11:13.880 --> 11:14.960]  You know that, don't you?
[11:14.960 --> 11:19.360]  So if you think that you're going to be safe, if you think you can trade your liberty for
[11:19.360 --> 11:24.240]  security and get safety, you're wrong.
[11:24.240 --> 11:27.360]  You're just going to make yourself a slave, you're not going to make yourself safe, you're
[11:27.360 --> 11:28.360]  not going to be secure.
[11:28.360 --> 11:34.080]  To the extent that you give up your liberty, you are a slave, slaves are never secure,
[11:34.080 --> 11:36.400]  slaves are never safe.
[11:36.400 --> 11:40.880]  And people who give up their freedom to become slaves are idiots.
[11:40.880 --> 11:43.080]  And these are the idiots that are now pushing this forward.
[11:43.080 --> 11:47.280]  And of course, we also had a gun control bill that was also introduced that week in Florida
[11:47.280 --> 11:49.360]  to ban guns, as usual.
[11:49.360 --> 11:51.000]  We had a Democrat introducing that.
[11:51.000 --> 11:53.320]  So I think that's interesting to look at that.
[11:53.320 --> 11:56.240]  It's also interesting to look at the information that is coming out now.
[11:56.240 --> 12:01.120]  We've had Got News go in and take a look at the man's background.
[12:01.120 --> 12:06.920]  And they looked at email overlaps, they looked at the public records information, and they
[12:06.920 --> 12:15.360]  show that he was posting on, he had set up an account on Myspace as Ashik Hamad.
[12:15.360 --> 12:20.520]  He recorded Islamic music, he did a lot of Muslim issues there.
[12:20.520 --> 12:21.520]  Very interesting.
[12:21.520 --> 12:23.360]  Was this a false flag from ISIS?
[12:23.360 --> 12:28.600]  Was this a false flag from the American government in order to get legislation through?
[12:28.600 --> 12:33.960]  When they, when he went into the FBI office, they put him into, they committed him into
[12:33.960 --> 12:34.960]  a hospital.
[12:34.960 --> 12:36.240]  What happened to him in the hospital?
[12:36.240 --> 12:37.240]  How long was he held?
[12:37.240 --> 12:39.000]  We don't know that yet.
[12:39.000 --> 12:42.360]  There's an article from the Sun Sentinel saying, hey, we need some more answers from the FBI.
[12:42.360 --> 12:43.360]  Yeah, we do.
[12:43.360 --> 12:44.360]  We do.
[12:44.360 --> 12:46.960]  We need more answers from them on a lot of different things, okay?
[12:46.960 --> 12:48.840]  But it's very interesting.
[12:48.840 --> 12:53.520]  He was put into this, but he was not held for very long because that was less than two
[12:53.520 --> 12:55.640]  months ago when all of this happened.
[12:55.640 --> 12:58.920]  I'm sure they gave him, if they really thought that he was insane, I'm sure they gave him
[12:58.920 --> 13:05.160]  some SSRIs, those are usually a factor in a shooting.
[13:05.160 --> 13:10.560]  Almost always we see that these murder suicide pills, as we've called them for a long time,
[13:10.560 --> 13:12.480]  are a factor in these shootings.
[13:12.480 --> 13:17.640]  That still doesn't mean that they weren't somebody's puppet, that somebody didn't put
[13:17.640 --> 13:21.000]  them up to this, somebody didn't make that an issue there.
[13:21.000 --> 13:24.720]  But I think it's also interesting that even though he walked into an FBI office, he was
[13:24.720 --> 13:27.800]  not put on a no fly list.
[13:27.800 --> 13:30.560]  Think about all the innocent people who've been put on a no fly list.
[13:30.560 --> 13:37.440]  When I started here at Info Wars back in mid-October of 2012, one of the first stories that I covered
[13:37.440 --> 13:44.520]  was a guy, his name was Wade Hicks, and he was going to see his wife in Japan.
[13:44.520 --> 13:46.280]  He was flying on a military transport.
[13:46.280 --> 13:47.880]  He'd been thoroughly vetted.
[13:47.880 --> 13:50.480]  He had been vetted, as a matter of fact, by the TSA recently.
[13:50.480 --> 13:56.360]  They'd given him a special badge or workers pass to get into because of the work that
[13:56.360 --> 13:57.360]  he did.
[13:57.360 --> 14:01.240]  He'd also been vetted by multiple law enforcement agencies because he owned firearms.
[14:01.240 --> 14:02.560]  He had to have background checks.
[14:02.560 --> 14:08.840]  He had done other things that caused him to get a higher level of permits and that sort
[14:08.840 --> 14:10.720]  of thing, privileged licenses from the FBI.
[14:10.720 --> 14:16.400]  So he'd been thoroughly vetted, he gets on a plane from California, flies to Hawaii,
[14:16.400 --> 14:17.400]  changes planes.
[14:17.400 --> 14:21.840]  This is a military flight because he's family of somebody who's in the service.
[14:21.840 --> 14:25.480]  As he gets on the second plane and they're about to take off, all of a sudden, agents
[14:25.480 --> 14:28.880]  come on the plane and drag him off and say, you're on a no fly list.
[14:28.880 --> 14:30.960]  Well, how did he get from California to Hawaii?
[14:30.960 --> 14:33.080]  He was on a no fly list, but he still got there.
[14:33.080 --> 14:34.200]  They pulled him off, and guess what?
[14:34.200 --> 14:35.200]  You can't fly from Hawaii.
[14:35.200 --> 14:36.600]  What are you going to do?
[14:36.600 --> 14:39.000]  Take a slow freighter somewhere?
[14:39.000 --> 14:43.560]  The guy was stuck and so he started reaching out to people, and eventually they got a hold
[14:43.560 --> 14:44.800]  of us.
[14:44.800 --> 14:45.800]  And we talked about it.
[14:45.800 --> 14:50.000]  We interviewed him when he eventually got back to the United States, but he could never
[14:50.000 --> 14:53.960]  get an answer as to why he had been singled out.
[14:53.960 --> 14:58.080]  He could never get an answer as to why he was on the no fly list.
[14:58.080 --> 15:01.840]  And even though they eventually said they let him fly, they wouldn't tell him that he
[15:01.840 --> 15:08.600]  was off of the list, and so that's why the Constitution, folks, is so important.
[15:08.600 --> 15:11.280]  This isn't something new.
[15:11.280 --> 15:16.680]  The tools of tyranny are new, but the principles of tyranny are age old.
[15:16.680 --> 15:19.880]  The founders of this country understood the principles of tyranny.
[15:19.880 --> 15:24.600]  That's why they created the Bill of Rights and the Constitution and said, we know what
[15:24.600 --> 15:27.720]  you guys have done in the past with your star chambers and things like that.
[15:27.720 --> 15:29.360]  We're not going to let you do that again.
[15:29.360 --> 15:31.600]  You're going to give people due process.
[15:31.600 --> 15:34.160]  You're going to tell them publicly what they were charged with.
[15:34.160 --> 15:38.600]  You're going to allow them to confront the witnesses against them in court.
[15:38.600 --> 15:42.480]  And so when you take that away, you have situations like Wade Hicks getting stranded
[15:42.480 --> 15:47.080]  in Hawaii and he hadn't done anything, but he still doesn't know if his name is clear,
[15:47.080 --> 15:52.600]  and yet you got this guy was allowed to not only fly, but to fly with nothing but a gun.
[15:52.600 --> 15:53.600]  Stay with us.
[15:53.600 --> 15:54.600]  We'll be right back.

[20:21.360 --> 20:33.720]  Rallying Patriots Worldwide in Defense of Human Liberty. It's Alex Jones.
[20:33.720 --> 20:37.400]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show. I'm David Knight. Alex is going to be joining us in
[20:37.400 --> 20:40.640]  the next hour. He's going to be talking about how Donald Trump is going to hit the ground
[20:40.640 --> 20:41.640]  running.
[20:41.640 --> 20:47.960]  Look, I have never in my lifetime seen the kind of activity on both sides prior to the
[20:47.960 --> 20:52.400]  inauguration. Usually it's kind of a rest period. It's a honeymoon period. And they
[20:52.400 --> 20:57.080]  usually give the president a like to pass on things. But they have been after him, as
[20:57.080 --> 21:03.440]  you well know, and every respect. And Donald Trump has not been sitting by idly either.
[21:03.440 --> 21:08.280]  They've made it very clear. Both Trump and Pence and the Republicans are going to hit
[21:08.280 --> 21:12.520]  the ground running. And they've got a lot of legislation that's going to be introduced
[21:12.520 --> 21:16.080]  right away. They've been preparing the groundwork for this. We're going to take a look at the
[21:16.080 --> 21:21.400]  strategies that they're coming up with Obamacare. What may possibly happen with Obamacare? Is
[21:21.400 --> 21:25.280]  it going to be repealed? Hopefully, yes. Everybody is saying that they're going to work to repeal
[21:25.280 --> 21:29.920]  it. The question is, are they going to replace it? If so, with what? And when will they do
[21:29.920 --> 21:33.480]  it? Well, they wait a long time before they replace it. I hope they replace it with the
[21:33.480 --> 21:37.640]  kind of market reforms that were on Donald Trump's website when he was running. It was
[21:37.640 --> 21:42.200]  a very detailed program that he and his staff put together there. Usually candidates don't
[21:42.200 --> 21:46.800]  come up with that kind of detail. They like to stick to broad generalities. And you saw
[21:46.800 --> 21:49.760]  that with the rest of the Republican field as well as with the Democrats. They just talk
[21:49.760 --> 21:55.600]  about broad principles, mom and apple pie, that sort of thing. But he was very specific
[21:55.600 --> 22:01.120]  in what he was going to do with healthcare. And he was going to replace the mandates
[22:01.120 --> 22:07.960]  of Obamacare with free market reforms, things that would empower us, things that would give
[22:07.960 --> 22:14.960]  us the economic freedom as well as the information and the competition to make efficient decisions.
[22:14.960 --> 22:18.800]  That's what's needed. You have to understand that when they're talking about this and they
[22:18.800 --> 22:24.000]  say, well, we're kind of the GOP, many of them are starting to get cold feet and saying,
[22:24.000 --> 22:28.560]  I don't know if we can do this. We've got a lot of taxes that are involved in this.
[22:28.560 --> 22:36.400]  You know, Obama created 17,000 new IRS agents to prosecute you, persecute you, harass you,
[22:36.400 --> 22:40.880]  to harass our people, to eat out their substance. We can't just pull out Thomas Jefferson and
[22:40.880 --> 22:46.000]  get rid of that, can we? That's Republicans saying that. Republicans, people like Ted
[22:46.000 --> 22:52.640]  Cruz and Marco Rubio and Lee who have in the past said that we're not going to give you
[22:52.640 --> 22:58.080]  the capability to increase the debt. And of course, the debt is the accumulated annual
[22:58.080 --> 23:02.280]  deficits that are going through. And now under Obama, it is skyrocketed. We're at nearly
[23:02.280 --> 23:08.160]  $20 trillion in terms of the accumulated annual deficits, the debt. And now they're talking
[23:08.160 --> 23:16.160]  about increasing it by another $9 trillion. That's a 50% increase, folks. And yeah, maybe
[23:16.160 --> 23:20.960]  out by 10 years. And of course, they're saying, oh, look, this isn't for real, you know, Ted
[23:20.960 --> 23:26.600]  Cruz is out there saying, this is just a head fake. This is something we're doing as a procedural
[23:26.600 --> 23:32.080]  ploy to make sure that we can run this through with only 51 votes instead of the required
[23:32.080 --> 23:36.320]  60 votes. It's going to free up our hand to get rid of this stuff. Well, that may be.
[23:36.320 --> 23:42.080]  But I've seen, especially Ted Cruz, change his position on things too many times to
[23:42.080 --> 23:46.080]  really trust it. Rand Paul said, hey, you're calling it a budget. It's a budget. You're
[23:46.080 --> 23:50.000]  calling it a budget and saying we need to vote on this budget to increase the deficit
[23:50.000 --> 23:56.480]  and one fell swoop by 50%. When it's a $20 trillion right now, the debt, it's absolutely
[23:56.480 --> 24:00.200]  stunning that they would do something like this. But we'll talk about that more later.
[24:00.200 --> 24:06.640]  I want to get to what people are talking about in terms of this phony Russian hack attack.
[24:06.640 --> 24:11.680]  And we've got a report I want to play from John McAfee. I want to give you some of the
[24:11.680 --> 24:15.160]  articles that people are pushing back some of the tweets that people are pushing back
[24:15.160 --> 24:21.200]  against this phony story and talk about why they keep pushing this no matter how ridiculous
[24:21.200 --> 24:26.560]  it is. I'm telling you, just as Alex Jones said earlier, they have something up their
[24:26.560 --> 24:31.920]  sleeve that is far bigger even than discrediting Donald Trump. They want to get themselves
[24:31.920 --> 24:38.920]  into the voting booth. They want to insinuate themselves into the voting machines. And the
[24:38.920 --> 24:42.200]  only way you can stop that, because see, that's the real problem. Instead of addressing the
[24:42.200 --> 24:47.000]  initial problem, the government will always create a second problem. They will create
[24:47.000 --> 24:52.760]  a crisis, in other words, and then they will use that crisis to take more power, more control
[24:52.760 --> 24:57.400]  over things. And what they're trying to do is to use this meme that they've now created
[24:57.400 --> 25:02.440]  in the public mind by saying, Russian hacking, Russian hacking. When all along, they never
[25:02.440 --> 25:06.920]  even said the Russians touched the machines. They never even insinuated that except in
[25:06.920 --> 25:11.360]  their headlines. When they say Russian hacking, that's what everybody is thinking. They're
[25:11.360 --> 25:16.600]  not thinking, oh, he's saying that somebody in the Russian intelligence services released
[25:16.600 --> 25:20.040]  Hillary Clinton's emails and we can see what a scumbag she was so nobody wanted to vote
[25:20.040 --> 25:24.840]  for her. That's what they're really saying. And that's not even true. Yes, Hillary is
[25:24.840 --> 25:28.760]  a scumbag, but it wasn't Russian state services that had to do it. So we're going to break
[25:28.760 --> 25:34.040]  that down with John McAfee. But before we leave the situation of the shooting in Fort
[25:34.040 --> 25:39.840]  Lauderdale, I think it's very important, you know, we had just seen Florida introduce
[25:39.840 --> 25:43.520]  a bill so that people could protect themselves and say, you're not going to create victim
[25:43.520 --> 25:49.120]  disarmament zones like airports, like college campuses, where somebody can go there and
[25:49.120 --> 25:53.760]  all they have to do is carry a gun, ignore your prohibitions, one person carries a gun,
[25:53.760 --> 25:56.520]  and then the rest of the people are helpless victims. And it's going to take a while for
[25:56.520 --> 26:00.840]  the police to get there. And with that in mind, the Florida legislature had introduced
[26:00.840 --> 26:05.160]  a bill to be considered to allow people to protect themselves at airports. And then
[26:05.160 --> 26:09.360]  we have this shooting. And that's probably going to be taken off the table now. We should
[26:09.360 --> 26:13.280]  double down as well. We should double down and point out that that's precisely what the
[26:13.280 --> 26:17.600]  remedy to that would be. There's another remedy if you don't want to carry. Or if they don't
[26:17.600 --> 26:22.680]  allow you to carry, you can still protect yourself. We were talking about this on Friday. We just
[26:22.680 --> 26:30.320]  came out with a product, tactical nanotechnology body armor. This is carbon nanotube technology,
[26:30.320 --> 26:37.040]  state of the art, very lightweight, very strong, very tough. This is a patented form of carbon
[26:37.040 --> 26:43.560]  nanotube technology, the lightest, strongest, most flexible body armor that is on the market.
[26:43.560 --> 26:47.760]  It's only a quarter of an inch thick, but it is field tested and confirmed to stop the
[26:47.760 --> 26:52.080]  most powerful pistol rounds in production. This waterproof is super lightweight. It's
[26:52.080 --> 26:56.600]  made in the US. It comes with a 20 year warranty, and you can buy it and support our operation
[26:56.600 --> 27:01.920]  at the same time you protect yourself. You can find it at infowarsstore.com. We have an
[27:01.920 --> 27:06.560]  entire line of tactical nanotechnology body armor. And one of the things that we sell
[27:06.560 --> 27:11.680]  besides vests is an insert that you can put into backpacks. And one of the stories that
[27:11.680 --> 27:16.080]  we came out of this Fort Lauderdale shooting was a guy who, when he heard the shots, realized
[27:16.080 --> 27:21.440]  what was going on, he hit the ground and he had on a backpack and he had his laptop in
[27:21.440 --> 27:28.640]  his backpack. And one of the bullets was shot at him and hit the edge of that laptop. And
[27:28.640 --> 27:33.120]  you can see the pictures of it where it is turned up. Now I don't know if a laptop would
[27:33.120 --> 27:37.840]  stop the bullet if it hit it perpendicular to the laptop. This hit it on the edge and
[27:37.840 --> 27:42.880]  stopped the bullet. Of course, we did have a guy who was at another recent Muslim shooting
[27:42.880 --> 27:48.280]  and he was spared in Istanbul by his iPhone. So yeah, you can stop it with that, but that's
[27:48.280 --> 27:52.280]  a very small area. Wouldn't it be better if you consciously knew that you had something
[27:52.280 --> 27:57.040]  that really could stop a bullet? Not maybe, but really would stop a bullet and you could
[27:57.040 --> 28:00.960]  use that to shield yourself, to shield your family. That right there, that insert you
[28:00.960 --> 28:06.920]  see, that is something that I think is a very powerful way to protect yourself, to protect
[28:06.920 --> 28:11.200]  your kids. You put that in their backpack and say, look, Johnny, somebody starts shooting
[28:11.200 --> 28:16.680]  at something. Now you've got something to at least hide behind or run with your back
[28:16.680 --> 28:19.600]  covered with this as you're running because that's what they're going to shoot for. They're
[28:19.600 --> 28:22.280]  going to shoot for your center mass. They're going to shoot for your back. So if you got
[28:22.280 --> 28:25.240]  that on your backpack, that's one of the best things that you could do.
[28:25.240 --> 28:29.760]  All right, now I want to get to some of the things that have been said in the continuing
[28:29.760 --> 28:34.840]  propaganda war. And we're going to talk about that as well as John McAfee's report where
[28:34.840 --> 28:40.160]  he absolutely destroys this phony idea, but he is not the only one who's out there. We've
[28:40.160 --> 28:45.200]  got a lot of tech people who have spoken out on the absurd narrative, but they're doing
[28:45.200 --> 28:50.600]  it because they've got something big in mind, something even bigger than discrediting Trump.
[28:50.600 --> 28:55.520]  They want to control our election. Stay with us, we'll be right back.
[28:55.520 --> 29:01.280]  Not a group you develop living defense for us. It took you over a year to do it. Why
[29:01.280 --> 29:05.960]  is this so good? Because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much
[29:05.960 --> 29:11.680]  scares me the most. I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water
[29:11.680 --> 29:16.920]  and beverages in my system, but right now we're dealing with massive parasites, which
[29:16.920 --> 29:21.680]  is anything that's harmful to your body that lives off a host mechanism right now with
[29:21.680 --> 29:27.720]  all the refugees spreading disease around. We have biological warfare going on everywhere.
[29:27.720 --> 29:30.640]  These are all parasites. Tell us about all the stuff that said that there's so many things
[29:30.640 --> 29:34.760]  that are in it. You have the neem in there. You have the organic clove bud, the organic
[29:34.760 --> 29:39.600]  wormwood. I recommend doing a parasite cleanse at least twice a year. All right, well, I'm
[29:39.600 --> 29:43.360]  glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today. It just came back in yesterday.

[33:02.200 --> 33:22.160]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[33:22.160 --> 33:28.680]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups. You want to stop tyranny? Well,
[33:28.680 --> 33:38.520]  so does he. Live from the infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones. Welcome back to the Alex
[33:38.520 --> 33:43.920]  Jones show. I'm David Knight. We're going to take a look at John McAfee. Of course,
[33:43.920 --> 33:51.000]  he's the guy that we've seen in the info war studio many times. He created McAfee security
[33:51.000 --> 33:54.960]  systems and then sold that and retired and he's had a lot of adventures since then and
[33:54.960 --> 34:00.960]  believes as well as running for president on the Libertarian Party ticket. He did not
[34:00.960 --> 34:05.880]  get the nomination unfortunately, but he came out and spoke as a computer expert and many
[34:05.880 --> 34:11.080]  computer experts are talking about this phony redacted report that's been put out. And of
[34:11.080 --> 34:15.840]  course, isn't it interesting that this report was released to NBC, The Washington Post and
[34:15.840 --> 34:20.160]  others before Donald Trump got a chance to take a look at it? You know that they're trying
[34:20.160 --> 34:25.920]  to create a political narrative here and you know that they continue to repeat this because
[34:25.920 --> 34:32.000]  they want to establish in the public's mind that somehow Russia got a hold of our election
[34:32.000 --> 34:35.920]  and rigged it. They don't want to say, hey, Russia told the truth about Hillary and people
[34:35.920 --> 34:39.480]  were so disgusted with her that they refused to vote for her. They don't want to talk about
[34:39.480 --> 34:43.800]  that. Instead, they want to insinuate that they've hacked our election. So I think Donald
[34:43.800 --> 34:47.520]  Trump should take this and should double down on this. Remember, he came out and said over
[34:47.520 --> 34:52.240]  the Christmas holidays, he was talking to some journalists and he said, no, computer is safe.
[34:52.240 --> 34:55.360]  Here's what he said. He said, you know, if you have something really important, write
[34:55.360 --> 34:59.840]  it down on a piece of paper and have it delivered by courier the old fashioned way. That's what
[34:59.840 --> 35:05.120]  Donald Trump told reporters. He was exactly right. He said, no, computer is safe. And
[35:05.120 --> 35:10.400]  so if we've got something that is as important as the election, let's not get DHS involved
[35:10.400 --> 35:14.880]  in our computers. We've seen already that they tried to insinuate themselves into multiple
[35:14.880 --> 35:21.840]  state election systems and they got the people who are running those systems very angry because
[35:21.840 --> 35:26.560]  it's our own government, of course, hacking them. It's the American government that funds
[35:26.560 --> 35:29.800]  most of the vulnerabilities. It's the American government that does more hacking than anybody
[35:29.800 --> 35:34.320]  else. It's the American government that overthrows regimes more than anybody else. And so if
[35:34.320 --> 35:38.240]  we don't want the federal government or dishonest actors inside the federal government rigging
[35:38.240 --> 35:44.880]  our elections, let's not give them the tools to do it, computerized voting machines.
[35:44.880 --> 35:49.520]  Let's do what Donald Trump said. Let's write it down. Let's have people, let's have human
[35:49.520 --> 35:56.400]  eyes on it every step of the way, counting these paper ballots. Human eyes watching as
[35:56.400 --> 36:02.320]  those paper ballots change custody in different places until the final results are reported.
[36:02.320 --> 36:07.200]  That's what we need. Paper ballots with human inspectors watching what's going on. Nothing
[36:07.200 --> 36:14.000]  other than that will be safe. And if we allow this to continue down the road of more computerization,
[36:14.000 --> 36:19.520]  we will have our election hacked and it may most likely will not be by a foreign government.
[36:19.520 --> 36:24.160]  It'll be by actors within our own government. But let's take a look at this phony report
[36:24.160 --> 36:29.200]  and the phony conclusions that are being drawn by people. First of all, this guy, Michael Morrell,
[36:30.080 --> 36:35.360]  the ex-CIA director. And this is the guy that replaced David Petraeus when David Petraeus
[36:35.360 --> 36:41.920]  violated national security secrets. But that didn't cause Michael Morrell to get upset about
[36:41.920 --> 36:47.280]  Hillary Clinton violating national security secrets. No, he was a confirmed never-trumper
[36:47.840 --> 36:54.320]  and he endorsed Hillary Clinton. And now that never-trumper Hillary Clinton fan who had no
[36:54.320 --> 36:58.320]  problems with Hillary Clinton's violation of national security said Trump's comments will
[36:58.320 --> 37:05.120]  lead to a wave of resignations from the intelligence services. Well, really? You don't think that maybe
[37:05.120 --> 37:10.160]  Hillary Clinton's callous disregard for national security putting out top secret and above top
[37:10.160 --> 37:15.920]  secret emails. You don't think that that had an effect on Morrell? How about the double standard
[37:15.920 --> 37:20.320]  for her? How about the fact that Hillary Clinton could violate national security secrets, but all
[37:20.320 --> 37:24.080]  these other people who are in intelligence agencies and military, they know they would go to jail
[37:24.080 --> 37:29.040]  for multiple life terms if they had done anything, even approaching what Hillary Clinton had done.
[37:29.040 --> 37:34.800]  What about Benghazi? Mr. Morrell, do you think that Benghazi demoralized the intelligence
[37:34.800 --> 37:40.000]  and military services? I think so. And you know, when we look at this report, there's absolutely
[37:40.000 --> 37:45.280]  nothing there. Maybe they redacted all of the juicy stuff, but I don't think so. Maybe, hey,
[37:45.280 --> 37:52.400]  here's an idea, maybe we could get the unredacted report on Clintonemail.com. Maybe Hillary's got
[37:52.400 --> 37:57.120]  an honor server if that thing is still operating. Maybe we could get a glimpse into what was really
[37:57.120 --> 38:01.920]  there because you know all the state secrets were right there advertised for people with a big
[38:01.920 --> 38:07.440]  pointer. Clintonemails, get them here. Right here. They're hot. They're hot. It's not too hard to get
[38:07.440 --> 38:12.480]  in. Here's all the Clinton emails. I'm Secretary of State. All this classified stuff we're talking
[38:12.480 --> 38:18.400]  about, you can get it right here. So if you're a hacker or you're another state that has the,
[38:19.040 --> 38:22.560]  doesn't have the best interest in the United States at hand, you can just go to get that
[38:22.560 --> 38:28.480]  information at Clintonemail.com. Let's play this report from John McAfee. And then we'll go back
[38:28.480 --> 38:32.880]  and look at what some of the other people are saying about this phony narrative. I'm going to be very
[38:32.880 --> 38:39.760]  frank with you in the American public. I think that today the most deceptive propaganda to date
[38:39.760 --> 38:46.560]  was perpetrated on the American public. The data that was presented, the evidence was called from
[38:46.560 --> 38:52.800]  a thing called the Grizzly Step Report put together jointly by Homeland Security and the FBI. In there
[38:52.800 --> 38:59.280]  are four facts which they claim prove that Russia did this hack. It was utter nonsense. The information
[38:59.280 --> 39:07.040]  was number one, Russian language was found in the malware. Number two, a Cyrillic keyboard was used.
[39:07.040 --> 39:13.440]  By the way, the forensic science can now tell what type of keyboard was used to develop a piece of
[39:13.440 --> 39:21.680]  malware. Number three, the compiler that is one of the piece of software that compiles the code
[39:21.680 --> 39:30.400]  so that it can execute always dates and timestamps. It said that the date, the timestamps were in a
[39:30.400 --> 39:36.400]  time zone for the business hours of Moscow and St. Petersburg and other places in Russia. And then
[39:36.400 --> 39:42.160]  number four, that the IP address pointed to a Russian address. Let me go through this and try
[39:42.160 --> 39:50.400]  to make it very simple for the American people. If the CIA wanted to hack Russia, the things you
[39:50.400 --> 39:56.640]  would not do is you would not include the English language in your software because that would then
[39:56.640 --> 40:04.240]  exclude everybody except English-speaking nations. You would certainly not use a keyboard that everybody
[40:04.240 --> 40:09.520]  knows that the CIA uses, whatever keyboard they use. You'd have them use a Chinese keyboard or
[40:09.520 --> 40:17.040]  something else. You would certainly remove the date and timestamp from the program so that you
[40:17.040 --> 40:22.480]  couldn't tell what business hours or what zone you were in when it was compiled. And number four,
[40:22.480 --> 40:31.680]  you would absolutely not have an IP address that points to you. Because seriously, if Russia declared
[40:31.680 --> 40:37.360]  war on us because we hacked Russia and the head of the CIA or the intelligence committees came to
[40:37.360 --> 40:42.240]  Congress and said, well, what happened? Well, you know, we didn't have time to remove the English
[40:42.240 --> 40:48.160]  language. We didn't have time to remove the date stamp. We didn't have time. The guy that couldn't
[40:48.160 --> 40:53.440]  use the Chinese keyboard, so we gave him our regular keyboard. And, you know, it was my wife's
[40:53.440 --> 41:00.640]  birthday, so I could not remove the IP address. Please. That person would be scheduled for suicide.
[41:00.640 --> 41:11.440]  So this is what they're asking us. Does Donald Trump have enough room to challenge this? I mean,
[41:11.440 --> 41:16.560]  the way you present it tonight, this doesn't sound credible. It doesn't sound conclusive.
[41:16.560 --> 41:24.880]  It sounds rather flimsy the way you've presented it. Well, it's not just flimsy. It's either this.
[41:24.880 --> 41:32.240]  It's propaganda intended to incite the American people to anger toward Russia for some reason,
[41:32.240 --> 41:39.760]  or our intelligence community is so ignorant and naive that they should all be replaced.
[41:39.760 --> 41:46.880]  And here's the kicker. Here is why it cannot possibly be an organized nation state. Because
[41:46.880 --> 41:52.480]  the hack on the DNC used a piece of malware a year and a half old, and there had been many
[41:52.480 --> 41:58.240]  updates since then. Do you actually believe the Russian intelligence services spend all their time
[41:58.960 --> 42:03.440]  improving their malware? And then when they do an important attack, go, well, I used that thing
[42:03.440 --> 42:09.440]  from a year ago. It only had a few bugs. No. This was done by an independent one-person kid
[42:09.440 --> 42:15.120]  that downloaded the software. And by the way, the software came from two different organizations
[42:15.840 --> 42:19.680]  that were there claimed to be two different organizations that are related to the Russian
[42:19.680 --> 42:26.720]  government. That's absolutely false. They're called APT-28 and APT-29. And those designations come
[42:26.720 --> 42:32.560]  from fire eyes, people who watch all the hacking groups. In truth, it's only one organization,
[42:32.560 --> 42:37.840]  and it's composed not just of Russians, but of people, kids all around the world. You can go on
[42:37.840 --> 42:44.080]  the dark web, download the software, hack somebody. And so this kid had obviously downloaded it a
[42:44.080 --> 42:49.120]  year and a half ago and had not bothered to update. So that's John McAfee, and he is saying what other
[42:49.120 --> 42:54.320]  people have been telling me. Look, we know who these Russian criminals are. They're not state
[42:54.320 --> 42:58.960]  actors. You don't need to be state actors. This was old malware. We'll be right back. To all the
[42:58.960 --> 43:03.280]  liberals who felt that Trump was like Hitler because he wants to build a wall, I wonder how
[43:03.280 --> 43:09.760]  they will feel about this. The Obama wall. That's right. Barack Obama is building a big beautiful
[43:09.760 --> 43:14.880]  wall around his new DC mansion. This is believed to be the first Obama wall built around one of the
[43:14.880 --> 43:20.480]  many Obama mansions. Yes, the Obama who said he wanted to get money out of politics has multiple
[43:20.480 --> 43:25.280]  million dollar mansions. Yes, the Obama who ran the first billion dollar campaign to keep money
[43:25.280 --> 43:30.560]  out of politics. Yes, that Obama who said we don't build walls. That's how we've always made this
[43:30.560 --> 43:39.120]  country great. Not by building walls, but by tearing down. We don't give in to our fears. We don't
[43:39.120 --> 43:44.880]  build up walls to keep people out. Obama is actually just renting this mansion, but obviously had to

[47:02.320 --> 47:04.960]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[47:04.960 --> 47:26.240]  Big Brother. Mainstream media. Government coverups. You want answers? Well, so does he.
[47:26.240 --> 47:37.200]  Live from Austin, Texas. Broadcasting worldwide. It's Alex Jones. Welcome back to the Alex Jones
[47:37.200 --> 47:42.720]  show. I'm David Knight. Alex Jones is going to be joining us in the next hour. This is a fight folks
[47:42.720 --> 47:48.320]  and as we said there is no honeymoon period in this fight. It continues to go on and before we
[47:48.320 --> 47:54.480]  get back to the news we just played that report from John McAfee where he broke down the absurd
[47:54.480 --> 48:00.320]  rationale that's being given people. It sounds very technical. It was done on a Cyrillic keyboard.
[48:00.320 --> 48:04.560]  It was done in a time zone that goes to Russia and so forth and so on and John McAfee said,
[48:04.560 --> 48:09.520]  think about this. If the Russians did that and left all those fingerprints there, they ought to be
[48:09.520 --> 48:14.560]  put in front of a firing squad or fired at least. But he said, you're not ever going to leave
[48:14.560 --> 48:18.960]  fingerprints like that. He says, if you were the US intelligence and you were attacking Russia,
[48:18.960 --> 48:22.160]  you would try to make it look like you were the Chinese. You wouldn't make it so obvious. They
[48:22.160 --> 48:26.080]  know that there's all these things that are left in there. That's not anything that's conclusive
[48:26.080 --> 48:30.720]  and then he talks about the fact that the malware that was used was very old. It's like a year and
[48:30.720 --> 48:34.160]  a half old. I think he said it was. We've got an article on that. We're going to get back into that
[48:34.160 --> 48:39.360]  but there's something even more interesting in all of this. We're going to tell you about how
[48:39.360 --> 48:46.560]  this is a report. This report was put out by the intelligence agencies that we're supposed to trust.
[48:46.560 --> 48:51.120]  This report goes back to 2012 folks. We've got some evidence of that. We're going to show that to you
[48:51.120 --> 48:57.600]  in just one moment. Before we do, I want you to think about refueling your body and refueling
[48:57.600 --> 49:02.880]  infowars at the same time. You know, this is the time of year that everybody says after the holidays
[49:02.880 --> 49:07.520]  and the unhealthy lifestyle habits that they've been involved in over their vacation. I say,
[49:07.520 --> 49:15.040]  all right, I'm going to go to the gym. I'm going to start a new diet. I'm going to do something
[49:15.040 --> 49:18.640]  for myself to make myself healthier. Well, one of the things that you can do is make sure your
[49:18.640 --> 49:23.280]  body is getting the proper nutrition, especially if you're going to go on a diet. If you're going
[49:23.280 --> 49:28.080]  to go on a diet, you're going to constrict calories to your body. That's fine as long as your body
[49:28.080 --> 49:32.240]  is getting the proper nutrition, but you need to make sure that you've got the supplemental
[49:32.240 --> 49:37.520]  base there that's going to make sure that your body is getting nutrients that it needs to be
[49:37.520 --> 49:41.760]  healthy. So if you're going to starve yourself, at least make sure that you're just starving
[49:41.760 --> 49:47.680]  yourself of things that are going to make you fat, not the things that your body needs to survive.
[49:47.680 --> 49:52.240]  And so with that in mind, we have created a special Make Our Bodies Great Again initiative
[49:52.240 --> 49:57.120]  for 2017. We've put a lot of products at InfoWars Life on sale. We've got Brain Force,
[49:57.120 --> 50:03.280]  Super Male Vitality, 30% off both of those, 30% off Survival Shield X2. That's our nascent iodine.
[50:03.280 --> 50:08.800]  We have 20% off Secret 12. That's our B12 formulation in liquid format. It's very easy to
[50:08.800 --> 50:14.160]  take and to assimilate. We have 20% off Liver Shield, 20% off Knockout. If you're having trouble
[50:14.160 --> 50:19.120]  sleeping, and of course, it's very important for your health that you get a restful night's sleep.
[50:19.120 --> 50:24.800]  So whatever's happening, this is a very safe and effective way to assist your body in getting
[50:24.800 --> 50:28.880]  sleep. Take a look at the natural ingredients that are in Knockout. That's 20% off. And of course,
[50:28.880 --> 50:34.720]  Prostagard, 20% off. You'll find many others at InfoWarsLife.com. You need to make sure you've
[50:34.720 --> 50:40.480]  got a base of healthy supplements there, especially if you're going to start restricting the calories
[50:40.480 --> 50:44.720]  that your body gets. There's a lot of stuff your body doesn't need, a lot of empty calories, but
[50:44.720 --> 50:49.520]  usually when people start cutting stuff back, they start cutting back the healthy stuff as well.
[50:49.520 --> 50:55.040]  So make sure you've got that base covered. Now let's go back to this report because some of the
[50:55.040 --> 50:58.800]  stuff that they were putting out there was summed up in a tweet by WikiLeaks that I retweeted.
[50:58.800 --> 51:03.840]  The US government's declassified Russian hacking report has the curious disclaimer
[51:03.840 --> 51:09.360]  that it's based on watching TV and reading tweets. It really seriously does. You go to the hill and
[51:09.360 --> 51:13.840]  they talk about five reasons the Intel community believes Russia interfered in the election and
[51:13.840 --> 51:19.920]  they go down some of those elements that John McAfee just destroyed. But then there's this
[51:19.920 --> 51:26.160]  jewel in there. The report notes that RT produced English language video like the Julian Assange
[51:26.160 --> 51:34.320]  special and so forth and so on. They also, folks, referenced Abbey Martin's program, Abbey
[51:34.320 --> 51:40.080]  Martin's program, Breaking the Set, ended two years ago. But according to the report, she tweeted
[51:40.080 --> 51:45.040]  out, she goes, well, here's the official DNI report on Russia. It says, my show, Breaking the Set,
[51:45.040 --> 51:52.560]  that ended two years ago, helped to cost Hillary Clinton the election. We have Glenn Greenwald
[51:52.560 --> 51:59.920]  summing it up in his tweet. He said the new report, number one, literally half of it is about RT.
[51:59.920 --> 52:05.200]  Number two, it contains the same assertions made multiple times. Number three, it includes no
[52:05.200 --> 52:10.480]  evidence for those claims. I think that's a pretty succinct summary there. There's a great article
[52:10.480 --> 52:16.160]  by Jeffrey Jackson talking about how open source intelligence overtook the DNI report
[52:16.160 --> 52:20.560]  in real time. And he's got those tweets in there. You can see that as people are looking
[52:20.560 --> 52:27.040]  at this DNI report, there's calling it out for what it is, total BS. In real time,
[52:27.040 --> 52:31.040]  people are looking at it technical people, people just looking at the logic of it. We've got the
[52:31.040 --> 52:35.040]  New York Times saying, and he puts it out this way, and Jeffrey Jackson does, the discredited
[52:35.040 --> 52:39.840]  New York Times produced an article calling the report, quote, a damning and surprisingly detailed
[52:39.840 --> 52:44.800]  account of Russia's efforts to undermine the American electoral system and Mrs. Clinton,
[52:44.800 --> 52:50.240]  unquote. However, just one paragraph later, the New York Times is forced to admit the DNI report
[52:50.240 --> 52:56.160]  contained poor sources and no evidence. They wrote, but the class declassified report contains
[52:56.160 --> 53:00.960]  no information about how the agencies had collected their data or had come to their conclusion.
[53:00.960 --> 53:04.720]  Like I said, maybe we've got to go to Hillary Clinton's official email account to get the
[53:04.720 --> 53:09.680]  unredacted report. It's probably there. And then we've had other people say, this is hilarious.
[53:09.680 --> 53:14.800]  Literally, anyone can download the supposed Russian hacker malware. Even the Daily Beast
[53:15.440 --> 53:21.040]  points out that there's nothing in the report to back it up. But here's the kicker. And this came
[53:21.040 --> 53:27.840]  from Jim Stone. It was an article by Cassandra Fairbanks. He said, shocker, proof that Russia's
[53:27.840 --> 53:34.160]  Trump support was compiled during Obama's election. And they say that in this report,
[53:35.040 --> 53:40.720]  just like we reported about Abby Martin's show, they blame that for taking it down,
[53:40.720 --> 53:45.520]  you can look at the report and see the references that they have there against RT. And again,
[53:45.520 --> 53:51.200]  RT is the focus of that report because it was RT that was telling you the truth about Hillary
[53:51.200 --> 53:55.920]  Clinton along with Infowars, along with Breitbart, along with the Daily Caller. See, when you were
[53:55.920 --> 54:01.600]  told the truth about Hillary Clinton, whoever put this out there, we do owe them a debt of
[54:01.600 --> 54:06.400]  gratitude, regardless of who it was, because you need to know the truth to make an informed
[54:06.400 --> 54:11.360]  decision when you're voting, don't you? And that's what we got. That's what they're calling hacking.
[54:11.360 --> 54:16.960]  It's not hacking. It is an expose of Hillary Clinton. But they go through this and they talk
[54:16.960 --> 54:22.080]  about how the report notes two RT shows breaking the set and truth seeker focused on the criticism
[54:22.080 --> 54:26.960]  of the U.S. The problem is both of these shows were off the air before the 2016 election season
[54:26.960 --> 54:32.800]  began. They point out that a large part of this report, the annex A of the report,
[54:34.000 --> 54:40.400]  was written four years ago. This is old information that they put in their report
[54:40.400 --> 54:46.880]  to say, this is the smoking gun. We have that Russia hacked our election. And again,
[54:46.880 --> 54:52.480]  they're using that term hack because they want to insinuate themselves into the electronic
[54:52.480 --> 54:57.520]  voting machines. And yet, we've got Lindsey Graham saying that Republicans who are happy
[54:57.520 --> 55:02.480]  about Russian meddling is what he calls it. Republicans who are happy about what happened
[55:02.480 --> 55:09.680]  are political hacks. See, we're happy, Lindsey, that the truth got out. And when you want to talk
[55:09.680 --> 55:15.040]  about hacks, when we look at this article, there he is with John McCain. If you look up hack the
[55:15.040 --> 55:20.720]  noun, you'll probably see them in the political subsection. You'll probably see the pictures of
[55:20.720 --> 55:26.480]  John McCain and Lindsey Graham right there in your dictionary as examples of political hacks,
[55:26.480 --> 55:32.800]  nouns, okay? Because hacks are typically writers or journalists who do boilerplate stuff that's
[55:32.800 --> 55:36.720]  been done by everybody else. They kind of plagiarize it. They take themes that have been done by
[55:36.720 --> 55:41.440]  other people and they paste them together. Well, that's what Lindsey Graham and John McCain do.
[55:41.440 --> 55:46.160]  They do it for the CIA. They do it for the globalists. They do it for the multinationals. They do it
[55:46.160 --> 55:52.480]  for the military industrial complex. They're the useful hacks. These are the two political hacks
[55:53.280 --> 55:59.440]  that sell you war, that sell you the surveillance state. And there they all are, all smiles with
[55:59.440 --> 56:04.560]  the guy that cut out Kellyanne Conway. Cut her out. She went for a 10 minute interview.
[56:04.560 --> 56:08.720]  Donald Trump tweeted about that. She had a 10 minute interview with him and
[56:08.720 --> 56:13.680]  with Todd and he only put up one minute of it. But boy, he had a love fest, I'm sure,
[56:13.680 --> 56:21.200]  with Lindsey Graham and John McCain. Meanwhile, we've got a Russian official saying it was Obama
[56:21.200 --> 56:27.440]  who undermined US democracy, not Moscow. See, that's what we have to understand. They're the
[56:27.440 --> 56:32.480]  ones who really have the motivation to undermine American democracy. That's what we saw in the
[56:32.480 --> 56:39.920]  DNC emails, didn't we? We saw the Democrat establishment undermining the election within
[56:39.920 --> 56:45.840]  their own party. And then we saw the corruption of Hillary Clinton and Podesta in these emails.
[56:45.840 --> 56:50.160]  He said, this is what the Russian ambassador said. And this is absolutely true. The danger to
[56:50.160 --> 56:57.840]  democracy is within the US itself. See, that's truly where the danger is. We have to understand
[56:57.840 --> 57:05.680]  that is the real issue before us. The phony hacking stories are not really the danger.
[57:05.680 --> 57:11.680]  And with that in mind, I want to talk briefly about Nat Hithoff who died at 91. He's a real
[57:11.680 --> 57:16.880]  liberal, somebody who was principled and would say what needed to be said, even if it offended
[57:17.440 --> 57:22.800]  a political party that he would be suspected to be aligned with. This is an article that he wrote
[57:22.800 --> 57:28.720]  eight years ago, January 7th, 2009. And we'll talk about this right out of time. I want to get to
[57:28.720 --> 57:32.560]  that. But Alex Jones is going to be joining us in the next hour. If I'm not sure what time he's
[57:32.560 --> 57:36.400]  coming in, stay with us right after the break. If Alex isn't with us, I'm going to talk about this
[57:36.400 --> 57:41.280]  or I'll talk about it when he comes back. But he's going to give us a live update on his perspective
[57:41.280 --> 57:46.240]  of what the globalists are pulling now and how Trump is onto them. Stay with us. We'll be right back.
[57:46.240 --> 57:51.840]  Not a group you developed living defense for us. It took you over a year to do it. Why is this so
[57:51.840 --> 57:57.600]  good? Because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most.
[57:57.600 --> 58:02.880]  I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in my system.
[58:02.880 --> 58:09.360]  But right now we're dealing with massive parasites, which is anything that's harmful to your body
[58:09.360 --> 58:15.280]  that lives off a host mechanism right now with all the refugees spreading disease around. We have
[58:15.280 --> 58:19.920]  biological warfare going on everywhere. These are all parasites. Tell us about all this episode.
[58:19.920 --> 58:23.840]  There's so many things that are in it. You have the neem in there. You have the organic clove
[58:23.840 --> 58:29.200]  bud, the organic wormwood. I recommend doing a parasite cleanse at least twice a year. All right,
[58:29.200 --> 58:32.720]  well, I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today. It just came back in
[58:32.720 --> 58:37.120]  yesterday. Living Defense, infowarslife.com. And folks, you can't lose full of stuff that's great
[58:37.120 --> 58:42.880]  for your body, period. And you support the broadcast infowarslife.com. Thank you, Dr. Group,

[59:13.360 --> 59:18.240]  Worsened as it still is worsening today. I was there telling you how to prepare yourself and your
[59:18.240 --> 59:24.480]  family. Now in 2016, even more information has been revealed concerning the connection between
[59:24.480 --> 59:31.200]  iodine and the gut, which many experts are now saying could be the biggest revelation ever concerning
[59:31.200 --> 59:35.760]  iodine. You can pull these studies up for yourself. This is the real deal, folks. And the truth is
[59:35.760 --> 59:42.080]  that iodine is essential, in my view, to any optimum health regimen. Stock up on Survival Shield X2
[59:42.080 --> 59:48.000]  today at infowarslife.com or by calling 888-253-3139.
[59:52.240 --> 59:54.960]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[59:54.960 --> 1:00:13.200]  Here is the passion of slaves. And this man knows no fear. He is Alex Jones.
[1:00:17.760 --> 1:00:21.760]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones show. I'm David Knight, your host. Alex is going to be joining us
[1:00:21.760 --> 1:00:28.160]  in this hour to talk about the fight that we now are in the middle of. Folks that didn't end with
[1:00:28.160 --> 1:00:35.040]  the election, as you saw, only stepped up. And this is a fight we can win. This is a fight that the
[1:00:35.040 --> 1:00:42.640]  other side has never had to document what they are saying. And now we can point at them and we
[1:00:42.640 --> 1:00:48.480]  can say the emperor has no clothes, the establishment press has no clothes. We're used to documenting
[1:00:48.480 --> 1:00:53.520]  what we're telling people because we know that there is a confirmation bias on the part of the
[1:00:53.520 --> 1:00:58.880]  public to believe what they're told on these news outlets that have been around for a long time.
[1:00:58.880 --> 1:01:04.800]  They've become prestigious because for a very long time, the major networks, ABC, CBS, NBC,
[1:01:04.800 --> 1:01:08.960]  even NPR, they were all saying the same thing, weren't they? They were saying exactly what the
[1:01:08.960 --> 1:01:14.560]  government was saying. And no matter how absurd it was, they could look at you, look right into
[1:01:14.560 --> 1:01:19.200]  that camera and say, that's the way it is. They would say that and people would believe that was
[1:01:19.200 --> 1:01:23.920]  the way that it was. And it wasn't. They were very selective about what they were reporting. They
[1:01:23.920 --> 1:01:28.640]  were telling you lies some of the time, not all of the time, it's important. When you're telling
[1:01:28.640 --> 1:01:34.160]  people lies and you're deceiving them, as we saw, if you go back and look at the CIA documents,
[1:01:34.160 --> 1:01:39.760]  Operation Mockingbird, you saw how the upper echelons and the anchors of various news media
[1:01:39.760 --> 1:01:44.880]  were co-opted by the CIA to get out the stories that they wanted to get out. So it's very important
[1:01:44.880 --> 1:01:48.320]  when you're doing that, when you're lying to people, when you've got a propaganda organization,
[1:01:48.320 --> 1:01:51.760]  that you do tell people the truth from time to time. So yeah, they did tell the truth from
[1:01:51.760 --> 1:01:56.080]  time to time. There you go, Operation Mockingbird. That's something very important to understand,
[1:01:56.080 --> 1:02:00.160]  especially in this context. Because we are now, as I pointed out in one of the
[1:02:00.800 --> 1:02:04.720]  videos we did a couple of weeks ago, I said, this is Operation Mockingbird part do.
[1:02:04.720 --> 1:02:10.960]  This is on steroids now, folks. We now have the State Department having been given, and of course,
[1:02:10.960 --> 1:02:16.000]  it was Republicans who were supporting this, even more so, I think, than the Democrats.
[1:02:16.800 --> 1:02:23.360]  They gave $180 million, sorry, $160 million. That's 80 each year for two years to the State
[1:02:23.360 --> 1:02:27.280]  Department to propagandize Americans. They're going to tell you what's real and what isn't.
[1:02:28.000 --> 1:02:31.280]  Do you really think that you can trust these people? Do you need somebody to think for you?
[1:02:31.280 --> 1:02:36.480]  No, you don't. You don't need somebody to think. You need a source that will give you
[1:02:37.520 --> 1:02:41.040]  a point of view. They'll tell you the facts, tell you what they think about it,
[1:02:41.040 --> 1:02:43.760]  and they will footnote it. That's what we do here at Infowars. Now,
[1:02:43.760 --> 1:02:48.320]  Obama is saying that he doesn't think that he misunderestimated Putin. No, he didn't say that.
[1:02:48.320 --> 1:02:52.480]  That was George W. Bush. I've said that so many times that I can hardly say the word
[1:02:52.480 --> 1:02:57.920]  underestimated without saying misunderestimated. Now, he said he did not underestimate Putin.
[1:02:57.920 --> 1:03:02.800]  Well, I think he did. I think he did. I think you know what he really underestimated was the
[1:03:02.800 --> 1:03:09.760]  intelligence of the American public. I think he really underestimated the power of the still
[1:03:09.760 --> 1:03:14.800]  independent press and of social media. And I think Jeffrey Jackson had it right on target when he
[1:03:14.800 --> 1:03:21.040]  called that open source intelligence. The founders called it committees of correspondence.
[1:03:22.000 --> 1:03:24.400]  They would write stuff and they would send it around to each other
[1:03:24.400 --> 1:03:29.280]  by paper. As Donald Trump said, you can't trust a computer if you got something important,
[1:03:29.280 --> 1:03:35.200]  write it down on paper and send it by a courier. That's true as well. Although he uses Twitter
[1:03:35.200 --> 1:03:40.480]  and electronic media very powerfully, you have to know when to use one and when to use the other.
[1:03:41.120 --> 1:03:45.920]  But Donald Trump is rather Obama is saying that he doesn't think that he underestimated Putin.
[1:03:45.920 --> 1:03:50.960]  He says, I think that I underestimated the degree to which in this new information age,
[1:03:50.960 --> 1:03:55.680]  it's possible to have an impact on our open societies, on our open systems. Now, I left
[1:03:55.680 --> 1:04:00.480]  that a little bit there. He said, where it's possible for misinformation, for cyber hacking
[1:04:00.480 --> 1:04:06.320]  and so forth to have an impact on our open societies, on our open systems. But see, what he
[1:04:06.320 --> 1:04:13.680]  really doesn't like is an open society. What he really doesn't like is an open system. And I want
[1:04:13.680 --> 1:04:19.440]  to go back eight years ago to an op-ed piece. It was written by Nat Hithoff, who just died.
[1:04:19.440 --> 1:04:26.400]  This is January the 7th, 2009. At that point in time, Obama was president-elect. And the title
[1:04:26.400 --> 1:04:32.000]  of this article that he put in the village voice was Obama's Black Widow. He said, Barack Obama
[1:04:32.000 --> 1:04:35.840]  will be in charge of the biggest domestic and international spying operation in history. Its
[1:04:35.840 --> 1:04:41.680]  prime engine is the NSA located in Fort Mead. The Baltimore Suns National Security correspondent
[1:04:41.680 --> 1:04:46.720]  said the colossal Craig computer, the supercomputer they have there was codenamed Black Widow.
[1:04:46.720 --> 1:04:56.080]  And he said, how will President Barack Obama use it? Oh boy, did he ever use it? Did he ever use
[1:04:56.080 --> 1:04:59.040]  the 1917 Espionage Act? Stay with us, we'll be right back.

[1:06:23.200 --> 1:06:36.080]  These are our people. Who are they? They are the Dark Armies. The Dark Murdering Armies was
[1:06:36.080 --> 1:06:52.080]  the only armor that was entrusted. The answer to 1984 is 1776. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:06:57.280 --> 1:07:00.560]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones show. David Knight on this Sunday, January 8th,
[1:07:00.560 --> 1:07:06.640]  2017, we're 11 days out from President Trump, and he is going to hit the ground running. He has
[1:07:06.640 --> 1:07:12.480]  put together an entire slate of action. Alex Jones is going to be joining us sometime this hour,
[1:07:12.480 --> 1:07:17.520]  and he's going to break that down further. Everyone has geared up for the fight in a way
[1:07:17.520 --> 1:07:21.200]  that I've never seen before, but I was talking about just before we went to break,
[1:07:21.200 --> 1:07:26.640]  I started to look at this article that came out eight years ago. And this is from Nat Hithoff,
[1:07:26.640 --> 1:07:32.480]  and this is when President Obama was president-elect. It was this time eight years ago,
[1:07:32.480 --> 1:07:37.280]  just before he was sworn in. And he called it Obama's Black Widow, and he was talking about
[1:07:37.280 --> 1:07:44.080]  the massive Cray supercomputer that was housed at the NSA in Maryland, talking about how we could
[1:07:44.080 --> 1:07:50.160]  do all these calculations, and what would Barack Obama do with this. And he pointed out a little
[1:07:50.160 --> 1:07:53.520]  bit of the history of this, and it's important for us to see where this came from. Remember now,
[1:07:53.520 --> 1:07:59.600]  the FISA Act, the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, that was put in place as a result of the
[1:07:59.600 --> 1:08:04.480]  hearings that we had in the 1970s with Frank Church and Congressman Pike. Both the Senate and the
[1:08:04.480 --> 1:08:12.080]  House had hearings on how the CIA and the NSA were violating their legal briefs, what they were
[1:08:12.080 --> 1:08:16.400]  created to do. They were created to go after foreign governments, and instead they were going
[1:08:16.400 --> 1:08:21.920]  after American citizens that were spying on Americans. How about that? Back in the 1970s,
[1:08:21.920 --> 1:08:26.640]  that was what started the church and the Pike hearings. And what came out of those
[1:08:27.360 --> 1:08:33.040]  was the FISA Act, Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, saying you're only going to do your
[1:08:33.040 --> 1:08:38.960]  surveillance on foreign individuals. That's why they're talking about a foreign tampering of our
[1:08:38.960 --> 1:08:44.080]  election. And so we're going to have Alex Jones, I was just given a note. Alex Jones is going to
[1:08:44.080 --> 1:08:48.160]  be coming in in about five minutes, so stay with us. I'm going to try to break this down
[1:08:48.160 --> 1:08:53.040]  in five minutes, what Nat Hithoff was telling us about Barack Obama eight years ago.
[1:08:54.080 --> 1:08:58.960]  Now, the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act was put in place, but in July of 2008,
[1:08:58.960 --> 1:09:03.760]  as Bush was getting ready to leave, what they did was they amended it. And they made it far
[1:09:03.760 --> 1:09:10.160]  more powerful, and they took away some of the things that had been there to control the CIA and
[1:09:10.160 --> 1:09:17.440]  the NSA. He said that the new Bush law provided a farcical judicial supervision over the NSA,
[1:09:17.440 --> 1:09:21.440]  and boy, is that the truth. It is absolute. Maybe we should call it, instead of the Foreign
[1:09:21.440 --> 1:09:27.120]  Intelligence Surveillance Act, the Farsical Intelligence Surveillance Act. They can go in
[1:09:27.120 --> 1:09:31.680]  and get a search warrant for Mr. and Mrs. Verizon, as Rand Paul said. They can say,
[1:09:31.680 --> 1:09:38.080]  I want to look at everybody that is on Verizon. And they go in to a single judge,
[1:09:39.120 --> 1:09:46.080]  and there is no adversary there on behalf of the people, because if you were actually going
[1:09:46.080 --> 1:09:49.760]  after an individual, like the Constitution said, that you go to get a search warrant, you say,
[1:09:49.760 --> 1:09:53.040]  this is what I'm looking for, this is who I'm looking at, and this is where I'm going to look
[1:09:53.040 --> 1:09:59.440]  for it. And you could have somebody that was representing Mr. and Mrs. Verizon, but this whole
[1:09:59.440 --> 1:10:06.320]  thing has become a farcical situation. And that was a change that was put in by George W. Bush.
[1:10:07.120 --> 1:10:14.240]  Now, at this time, Nat Hithoff said, why did Obama vote for this eye that never blinks?
[1:10:14.240 --> 1:10:19.920]  He had previously vowed to filibuster such a bill, but he said back in July, before he became,
[1:10:19.920 --> 1:10:26.240]  before he was elected president in November, he voted for that bill. And that was a clue,
[1:10:26.240 --> 1:10:30.400]  a tip-off of what was to come from Barack Obama, but he didn't know that at that time.
[1:10:31.200 --> 1:10:35.760]  Nat Hithoff, eight years ago, smelled a rat. And now it really stinks, doesn't it?
[1:10:35.760 --> 1:10:40.960]  After eight years of Barack Obama, the left should be hopping mad about the fact. And some of them
[1:10:40.960 --> 1:10:46.720]  are, some journalists are. The Barack Obama used the 1917 Espionage Act, more than all other
[1:10:46.720 --> 1:10:51.120]  presidents combined to go after journalists and whistleblowers. But he goes on at this time,
[1:10:51.120 --> 1:10:58.160]  he says, well, I think this is kind of suspicious. He said, the FISA amendment also gave immunity
[1:10:58.160 --> 1:11:02.560]  to telecommunications corporations. Now, what have we seen in the wake of this? We've seen the
[1:11:02.560 --> 1:11:08.080]  government push throughout the Obama years over and over again, CISA, ACT, PIPPA. And then finally,
[1:11:08.080 --> 1:11:14.720]  they got it passed with CISA. And that was a way to give immunity to all the people that are
[1:11:14.720 --> 1:11:19.840]  collecting information on you so that they would turn it over to the government and you can't sue
[1:11:19.840 --> 1:11:24.880]  them for it. See, that's ultimately where they want to go. And you have to understand that
[1:11:25.520 --> 1:11:31.040]  the recording of conversations, the recording of your actual email is not nearly as important to
[1:11:31.040 --> 1:11:36.560]  them as the metadata. And so you'll see these people saying it's just metadata, it's not important.
[1:11:36.560 --> 1:11:40.800]  That is the key thing they're after because that is what they can analyze algorithmically.
[1:11:40.800 --> 1:11:45.520]  He saw that coming eight years ago and called him out on it. So let's go right now. We've got
[1:11:45.520 --> 1:11:50.240]  Alex Jones has joined us. He's on the line. He's traveling. Alex.
[1:11:52.000 --> 1:11:57.360]  David, listening to you break down all these incredible big news stories we've got. I'm
[1:11:57.360 --> 1:12:02.160]  only gonna be here for a few segments, but I do have just some really important information for
[1:12:02.160 --> 1:12:12.800]  everybody. I'm clear to you. Everything coming across. Yes, yes, it broke up just a moment,
[1:12:12.800 --> 1:12:22.080]  but you're clear now. Go ahead. Can you hear me? Okay. Well, I'm gonna just let you go ahead and
[1:12:22.080 --> 1:12:26.800]  broadcast until the start of the next segment. I'm gonna be able to re-configure some share,
[1:12:26.800 --> 1:12:30.160]  reconnect. This is some important information. I'll be back after a break. Thank you.
[1:12:30.160 --> 1:12:33.840]  All right. We're going to reconnect with Alex. As I pointed out, he is not in studio today. He is
[1:12:33.840 --> 1:12:38.080]  traveling. So we're going to reconnect with Alex. One of the things that you have to understand,
[1:12:38.080 --> 1:12:44.160]  as I was saying, the metadata is really what they're after. They can't algorithmically go after
[1:12:44.160 --> 1:12:50.320]  your phone calls or your emails as easily as they can the metadata, which tells them essentially
[1:12:50.320 --> 1:12:54.640]  what you're doing, where you are mapping that. That's called geospatial intelligence. That is
[1:12:54.640 --> 1:12:59.840]  the fastest growing division of intelligence. And when we look at these massive denial of service
[1:12:59.840 --> 1:13:05.680]  attacks that have happened here at InfoWars and then now Matt Drudge has had that happen at least
[1:13:05.680 --> 1:13:09.840]  twice. The first time it happened, it took him down for 90 minutes. And then it happened a few
[1:13:09.840 --> 1:13:16.240]  days after that. Again, when we look at that, the place where that is coming from is your
[1:13:16.240 --> 1:13:20.640]  refrigerators and your medical devices and all these things that are called the Internet of
[1:13:20.640 --> 1:13:26.960]  Things. We had a story over the holidays from CNBC. Experts warned that 2017 will be the year
[1:13:26.960 --> 1:13:32.080]  of smart home hacking. Now, why would they want to get in and look at your thermostat? Do they really
[1:13:32.080 --> 1:13:36.000]  care what your temperature is? Well, there are other things that they can derive from that.
[1:13:36.640 --> 1:13:42.720]  But more importantly, hackers, and I'm including in this people like the NSA and the CIA,
[1:13:43.440 --> 1:13:49.600]  they can get into these machines and they can put viruses in them and they can turn them into spam
[1:13:49.600 --> 1:13:56.480]  robots that do requests for services so rapidly targeted at a particular website that they can
[1:13:56.480 --> 1:14:00.560]  shut people down from being able to get into that website. That's what the distributed denial of
[1:14:00.560 --> 1:14:06.240]  service attacks are about. And so that is the real key. As we see these devices come online,
[1:14:06.800 --> 1:14:10.960]  even the medical devices, medical devices that are coming online, most of them rely on a protocol
[1:14:10.960 --> 1:14:15.840]  that's coming out of China, out of China. Now, what could happen with that? What could possibly go
[1:14:15.840 --> 1:14:22.480]  wrong with putting that on your medical devices and making that a key part of the infrastructure?
[1:14:22.480 --> 1:14:28.080]  But it's not just medical devices. It's also your refrigerators, your washing machines. Remember,
[1:14:28.080 --> 1:14:32.640]  several years ago, when David Petraeus was still director of the CIA before he violated national,
[1:14:32.640 --> 1:14:36.720]  was caught violating national security, he said that they were going to be using your
[1:14:36.720 --> 1:14:43.120]  refrigerator to spy on you. Yes, they are. And see, the key thing is for them to get that
[1:14:43.120 --> 1:14:47.760]  geospatial intelligence, the activity-based intelligence. They want to look at your activities.
[1:14:47.760 --> 1:14:53.440]  They want to look at the entire human domain. Remember when we talked about Jade Helm? Mastering
[1:14:53.440 --> 1:14:59.440]  the human domain was the subtext of that. They wanted to see, really, what you're doing and map
[1:14:59.440 --> 1:15:04.800]  out who their enemies are, who their friends are. That is the key thing that we see developing.
[1:15:05.360 --> 1:15:11.040]  And as we go ahead with this, as we see the types of things like, now we've got massive snow storms
[1:15:11.040 --> 1:15:16.560]  all throughout the East Coast, especially, but really pretty much throughout the entire country,
[1:15:16.560 --> 1:15:22.800]  as Drudge Report pointed out, the average temperature is 11 degrees across the United States.
[1:15:22.800 --> 1:15:28.880]  But of course, the response to it in Virginia was an algorithm that would raise the toll price
[1:15:28.880 --> 1:15:35.600]  there up to $30 to $45 for a half-hour ride. See, that is the key. They're going to go in and
[1:15:35.600 --> 1:15:42.160]  they're going to use the roads as an information highway. They're going to collect even more
[1:15:42.160 --> 1:15:46.320]  information on you. They're going to have even more power if they want to take down individual
[1:15:46.320 --> 1:15:52.720]  sites. That is the true thread. As Donald Trump said, no computer is safe. That ought to be a
[1:15:52.720 --> 1:16:16.800]  warning sign for all of us. Stay with us. Alex Jones will be right back.

[1:20:27.600 --> 1:20:41.520]  bad luck when been blowing at my back i was born to bring trouble to wherever i'm at
[1:20:42.960 --> 1:20:46.400]  well we're only about one eleven days or so until preface from
[1:20:47.440 --> 1:20:52.480]  is the 45th president of the united states david knight is hosting there in living color hd and
[1:20:52.480 --> 1:20:57.600]  the radio tv studios in austin texas i'm on the road and my skype's having hiccups so i'm joining
[1:20:57.600 --> 1:21:03.120]  you via telephone good old-fashioned landline right now i'm just gonna be here for a couple more
[1:21:03.120 --> 1:21:07.840]  segments in then uh david will finish up obviously the transmission with some other clips and new
[1:21:07.840 --> 1:21:14.400]  stories i know he's got stacked up but i want to just preface what i'm about to tell you with this
[1:21:14.400 --> 1:21:24.560]  statement i've studied a lot of history and one of the most common things i read when i'm looking
[1:21:24.560 --> 1:21:28.960]  at contemporary history or history going back over the last few hundred years or even the last
[1:21:28.960 --> 1:21:36.720]  few thousand years is populations individuals people don't realize they're living in incredibly
[1:21:36.720 --> 1:21:46.080]  historically times people don't realize they're living in crossroads times or turning times or
[1:21:46.080 --> 1:21:52.160]  quickening times they don't realize they're living in those times for just a few years dictate the
[1:21:52.160 --> 1:21:59.440]  next hundred years or even the next thousand years or maybe even the entire destiny of a species
[1:21:59.440 --> 1:22:04.400]  because clearly with nuclear weapons and technology and the advancements and acceleration of time
[1:22:04.400 --> 1:22:11.600]  all the old quickenings we saw are going to be more intense like birth paints so that said
[1:22:12.400 --> 1:22:17.680]  before i went on i was just thinking of how do you highlight to people that in amongst all the
[1:22:17.680 --> 1:22:23.680]  incredibly important news that we all cover here from genetically engineered you know
[1:22:23.680 --> 1:22:30.480]  humanoids that they're admittedly creating to pharmacological crops to babies with five parents
[1:22:30.480 --> 1:22:37.520]  to flesh eating bacteria spreading across the united states and just leprosy spreading all
[1:22:37.520 --> 1:22:42.960]  across the united states i mean just we are living in insane times also insanely good
[1:22:42.960 --> 1:22:47.840]  things are happening all over the world humanities waking up to globalism but what i'm going to
[1:22:47.840 --> 1:22:52.960]  announce here to you today is just a summation of what i've been working on the last few weeks
[1:22:54.720 --> 1:22:59.760]  the reason the info wars is so popular not just with the public but with the military
[1:22:59.760 --> 1:23:04.400]  intelligence agencies and foreign leaders is we really do know what we're talking about
[1:23:05.600 --> 1:23:12.160]  and we're one of the only outlets that's not controlled but there's also not so much a feedback
[1:23:12.160 --> 1:23:19.280]  loop but but an intensification or an amplification of how accurate we are now that we're so trusted
[1:23:19.920 --> 1:23:24.080]  and now the patriots are making moves worldwide against tyrannical states
[1:23:24.080 --> 1:23:30.480]  namely the globalist the world government state that now we're given information nobody else says
[1:23:30.480 --> 1:23:35.360]  and i want to explain to everybody that listeners have already seen the incredible stories we break
[1:23:35.360 --> 1:23:38.800]  they've already seen the exclusives we get they already know the people we talk to
[1:23:38.800 --> 1:23:44.160]  and i'm just going to stop right there just today i talked to folks as high as it goes
[1:23:44.160 --> 1:23:52.240]  we'll leave it at that and let me just assure you from top generals and other patriots they
[1:23:52.240 --> 1:23:59.600]  say we are absolutely bullseye dead on target destroying the globalist and they said tell
[1:23:59.600 --> 1:24:06.880]  your audience keep it up you literally are all we've got now that's quite a bit but i don't
[1:24:06.880 --> 1:24:11.040]  care what color you are where you came from if you're aware of the new world order you've got
[1:24:11.040 --> 1:24:15.840]  that love of liberty beating your heart you are the people the globalists and george soros are
[1:24:15.840 --> 1:24:24.080]  scared of now i've had it confirmed to me from multiple sources in just the last two days including
[1:24:24.080 --> 1:24:31.520]  today that indeed but our other sources have broken down is accurate the globalists are
[1:24:31.520 --> 1:24:37.040]  thinking of a way to try to keep trump from getting in in 11 days they are seriously trying
[1:24:38.080 --> 1:24:42.800]  you've already seen them do all the stuff they did during the campaign i'm not going to mention
[1:24:42.800 --> 1:24:49.120]  that again you've already saw all the going after the electors the recounts the try to stop the
[1:24:49.120 --> 1:24:56.720]  nomination all of it they are only intensifying them and that's why yesterday in a letter that's
[1:24:56.720 --> 1:25:04.240]  that's how it was announced the public j johnson of dhs federalized all of the elections a total
[1:25:04.240 --> 1:25:10.400]  power grab outside of congress by like the constitution and it says that his rogue agency
[1:25:10.400 --> 1:25:17.360]  with loretta lynch it and all the rest of them as part of it are in control of our elections now
[1:25:17.360 --> 1:25:22.320]  they would only do that knowing trumps going to reverse it if they were seriously considering
[1:25:22.320 --> 1:25:27.600]  trying to overthrow trump that having new elections then they would already be in place
[1:25:27.600 --> 1:25:32.720]  to take control of the states that that voted for trump and steal those states just like they got
[1:25:32.720 --> 1:25:41.200]  caught in west virginia georgia and four other states red-handed breaking in to the systems
[1:25:41.200 --> 1:25:46.880]  they said oh we were just checking them lovingly no those are states that that the prop was really
[1:25:46.880 --> 1:25:51.680]  ahead in the polls they had fake polls out they were supposed to go to hillary the state officials
[1:25:51.680 --> 1:25:57.840]  were able to stop it because they knew what they were looking for cuz trump and you and i and drudge
[1:25:57.840 --> 1:26:03.520]  everybody else who's awake warned everybody had made election fraud an issue remember
[1:26:03.520 --> 1:26:07.040]  they said there was no such thing as election fraud months before the election when i raised it
[1:26:07.040 --> 1:26:11.920]  trump raised it obama came on attack me hillary attacked me by name they said he's insane
[1:26:12.480 --> 1:26:16.000]  then they turned around and federalized it why did i say they were going to federalize because
[1:26:16.000 --> 1:26:21.840]  they were already doing it and i have to be careful how much i tell people okay because we don't want
[1:26:21.840 --> 1:26:27.600]  to give away sources but at this point if trump gets in in 11 days he's going to go right to work
[1:26:27.600 --> 1:26:31.680]  folks 20 hours a day non-stop but i'm going to give you the good news or the bad news right now
[1:26:32.800 --> 1:26:39.200]  this country is in an absolute sudden death over time fight for its life right now
[1:26:40.400 --> 1:26:46.240]  this is 21st century warfare and we're not winning and they're not winning they are still in power
[1:26:46.240 --> 1:26:50.560]  they are preparing some type of move the good news is the public's not buying it
[1:26:50.560 --> 1:26:54.480]  but we could see them try to arrest trump for the next 11 days we could see them
[1:26:54.480 --> 1:26:59.440]  have you know a helicopter flying with missiles and blow you know killing i mean i'm telling you
[1:26:59.440 --> 1:27:05.120]  this is what you see in other countries this is a worldwide crime syndicate so pissed that america
[1:27:05.120 --> 1:27:10.720]  is rising again and by the way trump's completely real we've got patriots in our government that
[1:27:10.720 --> 1:27:16.720]  are sick of watching george soros do this to us this is a real attempt to take the country back
[1:27:16.720 --> 1:27:21.200]  and have a have policies of prosperity again it doesn't mean that they're perfect it doesn't mean
[1:27:21.200 --> 1:27:25.040]  there aren't a bunch of good old boys the point is they're not out to get you and your family
[1:27:25.040 --> 1:27:32.000]  so help is here ladies and gentlemen but but they are so incredibly angry right now and i
[1:27:32.000 --> 1:27:35.680]  noticed it's got hundreds of thousands of millions of views thing on which channel you look at
[1:27:35.680 --> 1:27:40.320]  before i put out some audio files warning of the fact that dhs just federalized elections and
[1:27:40.320 --> 1:27:45.920]  they're in the preparation to overthrow trump it doesn't mean they'll get away with it it means
[1:27:45.920 --> 1:27:50.480]  i want to be here in 1112 days and folks say see alex you were wrong it never happened because
[1:27:50.480 --> 1:27:54.800]  we stopped it and then we can be like the dark night who gets you know criticized when we really
[1:27:54.800 --> 1:28:00.240]  save the day all of you to use the batman analogy are the dark nights out there that have got to
[1:28:00.240 --> 1:28:04.880]  continue to be criticized having to be attacked because the general public are still such babies
[1:28:04.880 --> 1:28:09.600]  on average but the people that count in the military at the highest levels of intelligence
[1:28:09.600 --> 1:28:14.560]  agencies and incorporations that are pro america and are not out to get the people and who want to
[1:28:14.560 --> 1:28:19.520]  make the country great again they are absolutely aware of what's happening and the fact that you
[1:28:19.520 --> 1:28:24.400]  woke up the fact that you woke up others the fact that i woke up so many people and drudge and others
[1:28:24.400 --> 1:28:33.040]  did created a major wedge into the enemy the enemy is collapsing worldwide right now that's why

[1:32:55.520 --> 1:33:04.960]  dot com you're listening to the alex jones show
[1:33:13.520 --> 1:33:14.560]  yeah take me live
[1:33:14.560 --> 1:33:27.200]  we are on the march the empire is on the run alex jones and the gcn radio network
[1:33:27.200 --> 1:33:38.640]  so
[1:33:40.880 --> 1:33:46.320]  it's a fact that most people who are living through incredibly historic times almost never
[1:33:46.320 --> 1:33:50.480]  recognized that it's happening and some of the most effective individuals fighting against
[1:33:50.480 --> 1:33:55.920]  tyranny are too busy fighting tyranny to ever basically take credit for it but we're not here
[1:33:55.920 --> 1:34:00.800]  taking credit for anything because the battle is ongoing but people listening to this broadcast
[1:34:00.800 --> 1:34:06.800]  have to understand it is the opposite of hype when i tell you that there is literally a battle
[1:34:06.800 --> 1:34:13.600]  for this country and every other major nation sovereignty going on right now globalism or
[1:34:13.600 --> 1:34:19.280]  private corporate world government was so arrogant and thought we were so stupid that it could build
[1:34:20.080 --> 1:34:25.680]  a world planetary corporate system and just keep denying it existed while they publicly
[1:34:25.680 --> 1:34:30.880]  transferred power to themselves now here was the problem they openly told the intelligentsia
[1:34:31.440 --> 1:34:36.480]  the military brass you name it for 60 years that they were building a global system for peace
[1:34:37.120 --> 1:34:42.720]  and the world government was meant to give the people empowerment now that the public understands
[1:34:42.720 --> 1:34:49.920]  that globalism is really eugenics based and not you know like the un says some loving sweet kumbaya
[1:34:49.920 --> 1:34:56.880]  system or or like unicef says it's falling apart so they are striking back in fact i was reading
[1:34:56.880 --> 1:35:02.800]  the economist magazine the latest issue and they were admitting the answer is the cities
[1:35:03.360 --> 1:35:07.680]  they said the globalism still has control of cities people are in debt they're living in
[1:35:07.680 --> 1:35:12.880]  compact buildings they basically don't know how to take care of themselves they're stupid on average
[1:35:12.880 --> 1:35:17.920]  this is they don't say it like that but they say they're cosmopolitan they buy what we do
[1:35:17.920 --> 1:35:21.680]  they like to pay five times more than they should for an apartment because it's trendy
[1:35:21.680 --> 1:35:25.760]  they like to drive cars to go they don't go out and hunt they don't go out and fish they don't go
[1:35:25.760 --> 1:35:31.440]  out and farm they don't roof their own house they're good little consumers that will rent everything
[1:35:31.440 --> 1:35:36.320]  and we have a living self-driving you know cars and to just let us control them and they admitted
[1:35:37.120 --> 1:35:43.520]  that it's key for globalist combines big banks to only give money through social engineering
[1:35:43.520 --> 1:35:50.160]  that's a jenna 21 to the big cities you know war between rural suburban
[1:35:51.680 --> 1:35:56.880]  systems versus the cities so they're openly declaring the war i mean you see the hollywood
[1:35:56.880 --> 1:36:03.840]  stars we've got on info wars dot com tom hanks and all these people so embarrassingly crying for
[1:36:03.840 --> 1:36:10.000]  obama and how beautiful it was and how sad it's all falling apart these people are the stupidest
[1:36:10.000 --> 1:36:17.760]  most moronic pathetic servile fools the world has ever seen but here's the problem the hardcore
[1:36:17.760 --> 1:36:24.240]  social engineers that are controlling them aren't and so everybody think about that obama's doing
[1:36:24.240 --> 1:36:29.520]  everything he can to stop trump's mandate the mandate that swept the house the senate
[1:36:30.400 --> 1:36:36.400]  900 seats and legislatures a ton of governors one of the biggest political realignments
[1:36:36.400 --> 1:36:41.520]  in our history and it's happening all over the world at the same time part of a super wave
[1:36:41.520 --> 1:36:48.160]  a super revolt against globalism being led by patriots in this country as well as the uk
[1:36:48.160 --> 1:36:53.600]  as well as russia and so that's why they project on to us everything that they are
[1:36:55.200 --> 1:37:02.240]  and say that oh the reason you know the trump one is the russians because they know full well
[1:37:02.240 --> 1:37:07.680]  the globalist the communist chinese the saudi arabians the eu the mainstream media
[1:37:07.680 --> 1:37:15.360]  all piled on for hillary clinton and it was a repudiation of all of them so even if you buy
[1:37:15.360 --> 1:37:19.440]  that it was the quote russia and i've read this report zero hedge has a whole thing posted it's
[1:37:19.440 --> 1:37:27.520]  on info wars dot com if you read the stupid cia report it goes on this episode of rt someone said
[1:37:27.520 --> 1:37:33.520]  i wonder if it's true that hillary's falling down then on this episode they talked about will
[1:37:33.520 --> 1:37:39.200]  hillary go to jail there's a major movement pushing it then on another and it was like
[1:37:39.200 --> 1:37:44.720]  mommy it was like a ten-year-old tattling the mommy and then he pulled my hair and then he stole
[1:37:44.720 --> 1:37:52.000]  my snow cone and then he broke my barbie doll this was their hack and again never a material hack
[1:37:52.000 --> 1:37:57.920]  imagine trump sat there for two hours hearing them go sir here's a clip of rt where they
[1:37:58.640 --> 1:38:02.880]  where they said you know something about you positive and something negative of course some
[1:38:02.880 --> 1:38:08.880]  of the russian media was negative i mean as if russia has this big influence i mean our youtube
[1:38:08.880 --> 1:38:14.320]  channel is bigger than rt is there in the us this is just crazy now and i'm not putting down rt
[1:38:14.320 --> 1:38:22.320]  but imagine this folks they are saying that rt even though read the ci report just just
[1:38:22.320 --> 1:38:27.680]  just i mean it's on info wars dot com or just type in you know see the ci briefing trump was given
[1:38:28.320 --> 1:38:35.360]  and it's this it's it's photoshop clips you know like little screenshots out of like rt and then
[1:38:35.360 --> 1:38:41.920]  russian newspapers going look they said bad things about hillary and that's why she lost what
[1:38:41.920 --> 1:38:47.600]  what the reason she lost was the whole msm put everything they could behind hillary and it blew
[1:38:47.600 --> 1:38:52.560]  up in your faces and everyone hates you now they're sick of being forced fed that's why it blew up
[1:38:52.560 --> 1:38:57.360]  in your face is not the russians of course the russians have pulled away from the exact same
[1:38:57.360 --> 1:39:02.880]  megabanks and we salute them for that we hope everybody from from chile to nigeria you know
[1:39:02.880 --> 1:39:10.800]  from mexico to to teneza i everybody from japan to morocco you know pulls out of the new old
[1:39:10.800 --> 1:39:15.440]  order and a bunch of megabanks that just make money up out of nothing and create derivatives
[1:39:15.440 --> 1:39:20.960]  bankrupt everybody and enslave everyone hope they all go straight to hell so again they're
[1:39:20.960 --> 1:39:27.360]  crippled they're out of control they're falling apart the problem is they know they're losing
[1:39:27.360 --> 1:39:32.400]  everything fast and they know trump is intending to prosecute them for their crimes and really
[1:39:32.400 --> 1:39:38.400]  clean house in closing i'm going to say this the hand of a ton tonight they're already before even
[1:39:38.400 --> 1:39:43.120]  it's in moving to repeal obama here he reportedly already has the votes republican leadership is
[1:39:43.120 --> 1:39:48.960]  panicking the wall of course we have to start the building of it and then through tariffs that
[1:39:48.960 --> 1:39:53.760]  mexico doesn't comply very low ends we can pay for the wall but they're going oh look he's building
[1:39:53.760 --> 1:40:00.560]  it but we have to pay he's wrong borders means national sovereignty on china he's already getting
[1:40:00.560 --> 1:40:05.680]  ready and has the votes to cut the corporate income tax to bring the jobs back over a trillion
[1:40:05.680 --> 1:40:11.440]  i mean ladies and gentlemen he's already demanding all the paperwork on obama ordering the borders
[1:40:11.440 --> 1:40:16.960]  wide open and all the executive criminal activity and all the secret orders that obama signed you
[1:40:16.960 --> 1:40:21.840]  know the where the main body of the paper is secret only the the the the boil downs public
[1:40:21.840 --> 1:40:28.080]  trump is about to absolutely come after them if they would have kissed his butt he would have
[1:40:28.080 --> 1:40:33.360]  still come after him that's why they're so scared and fighting for their lives because trump is a
[1:40:33.360 --> 1:40:38.160]  patriot i'm going to say it again i've done research i've checked with the proper channels
[1:40:38.160 --> 1:40:43.120]  that have also seen what he's done trumps for real they're panicking trumps for real they're
[1:40:43.120 --> 1:40:51.200]  panicking trumps for real trumps mentor for 20 plus years was the top lawyer for the mccarty
[1:40:51.760 --> 1:40:58.240]  unamerican activities commission and others in new york and and that's why they're so scared
[1:40:58.240 --> 1:41:03.280]  trump knows everything trump is more john birch society than john birch society that's the real
[1:41:03.280 --> 1:41:09.600]  donald trump that's a plate pop them on him this whole time waiting building a database of patriots
[1:41:09.600 --> 1:41:16.400]  build a database of citizens waiting waiting for this wave to come uh folks trumps prescient okay
[1:41:16.400 --> 1:41:21.440]  that's why they're so scared they are crapping their drawers right now they understand the move
[1:41:21.440 --> 1:41:26.480]  they have panic in their eyes if they try to start a war or they try to kill trump the military is
[1:41:26.480 --> 1:41:32.080]  going to move against them so understand that the military and the fbi and most of the agencies who
[1:41:32.080 --> 1:41:36.000]  aren't perfect but they don't want to be involved a bunch of child molesters they're with trump the
[1:41:36.000 --> 1:41:41.040]  american people they want to make america great again this is a historical mission going on and i
[1:41:41.040 --> 1:41:46.560]  can tell you this is now happening and tell you that we are spot on and our analysis and breakdown
[1:41:46.560 --> 1:41:51.440]  i've been told from the highest levels is is is dead on with what's currently happening we are in
[1:41:51.440 --> 1:41:57.280]  the middle of the most epic time this country and this world has ever seen this is such an
[1:41:57.280 --> 1:42:01.440]  amazing time and even though they're able to kill from and try to stop this the awakening so big
[1:42:01.440 --> 1:42:05.680]  it's going to blast through all of that and that's why they're in such panic because hollywood
[1:42:06.480 --> 1:42:12.800]  and the globalist are a bunch of anti-family anti christian weirdo freaks that are in a
[1:42:12.800 --> 1:42:18.000]  cult basically okay and that's why hollywood is freaking out and going so crazy right now because
[1:42:18.000 --> 1:42:24.160]  these people are very degenerate very very wicked control freaks who really get off on
[1:42:24.160 --> 1:42:28.880]  bringing america down and and and who want to mount our head on the wall and basically celebrate
[1:42:28.880 --> 1:42:34.880]  that they finally control the us sucked it dry and use it to build a big giant stinking world
[1:42:34.880 --> 1:42:40.960]  government so again there is a civil war going on between globalists they're the foreign occupiers
[1:42:40.960 --> 1:42:45.360]  they're the new world order against we the people working with trump in new media against the

[1:47:04.880 --> 1:47:06.880]  so
[1:47:24.160 --> 1:47:27.360]  defense of human liberty alex jones
[1:47:27.360 --> 1:47:34.080]  welcome back to the alex jones show i'm david knight and as you just heard from alex jones
[1:47:34.800 --> 1:47:38.240]  the globalists don't think that they've lost they think they're still in the game
[1:47:38.240 --> 1:47:44.080]  as he points out it can go either way right now we have one one election we won brexit it looks like
[1:47:45.040 --> 1:47:52.080]  things are developing in certain countries people taking back control of their lives
[1:47:52.080 --> 1:47:57.920]  and of course we saw in the eu we had one of the people on his way out of the european union
[1:47:57.920 --> 1:48:03.520]  council the rotating head of that said as he was leaving that we have to make sure that we don't
[1:48:03.520 --> 1:48:09.200]  let citizens participate in any more of these referendums he called them adventures he said
[1:48:09.200 --> 1:48:15.280]  i'm asking eu leaders to stop with adventures like the british and italian referendums on
[1:48:15.280 --> 1:48:20.960]  domestic issues that pose a threat to the eu so if you're threatening the eu by saying that you
[1:48:20.960 --> 1:48:25.440]  want to get out of it he's saying don't let them have a vote on that let's come from the new american
[1:48:25.440 --> 1:48:31.840]  as alex is pointing out they have been on the trail of globalism for a very long time as we have
[1:48:31.840 --> 1:48:38.160]  and we understand what he's really saying here and we've seen this happen before we've seen the
[1:48:38.720 --> 1:48:45.200]  european union take out an elected president in greece and put in a goldman sacks banker
[1:48:45.200 --> 1:48:48.240]  and it was nigel forage who called him on it said who are you
[1:48:48.240 --> 1:48:54.480]  to override the will the people in the place where democracy started and we're going to look at
[1:48:54.480 --> 1:48:59.600]  what's going on with guaranteed income a universal basic income this is something else that they're
[1:48:59.600 --> 1:49:05.120]  pushing this is another issue that just got a start with an experiment in finland the first
[1:49:05.120 --> 1:49:09.200]  people they're going to give 2000 citizens a guaranteed income i want to talk about that and
[1:49:09.200 --> 1:49:14.640]  how this all plays to the fact that the globalists are still working on the same plan they've been
[1:49:14.640 --> 1:49:20.240]  working on for a very long time but quickly i want to remind you that we have a sale the 2017
[1:49:20.240 --> 1:49:26.240]  make our bodies great again initiative and as we tell you all the time there's a lot of toxic
[1:49:26.240 --> 1:49:31.760]  garbage in your food your water your air that means that you're constantly under a chemical

[1:49:53.360 --> 1:49:58.240]  itself even if it wasn't under attack and this time of year when so many people are going out with
[1:49:58.240 --> 1:50:01.680]  a new year's resolution that's great so they're going to get in better shape a lot of people will
[1:50:01.680 --> 1:50:07.200]  go on some kind of a diet and as part of that diet they may expose themselves even more toxins or
[1:50:07.200 --> 1:50:12.240]  they may eliminate certain nutritional things that they need as they restrict their calories so it's
[1:50:12.240 --> 1:50:18.320]  important if you're going to do something like that make sure you've got your base covered with a vital
[1:50:18.320 --> 1:50:24.000]  nutrients that your body needs to keep going as you participate in that so what we've done is we've

[1:51:28.640 --> 1:51:34.880]  is the EU saying hey guys we need to stop giving people a say because they're making the wrong
[1:51:34.880 --> 1:51:39.600]  decisions they're threatening us they're threatening threatening our political body because they don't
[1:51:39.600 --> 1:51:44.640]  like what we're doing they say it's making them poorer it's making them more dependent and now
[1:51:44.640 --> 1:51:49.840]  they readily admit that yeah the policies haven't worked out too well for a lot of the people but
[1:51:49.840 --> 1:51:56.080]  you know they're more efficient for us that's what they're saying and so when we look at this program
[1:51:56.080 --> 1:52:00.720]  that's coming out of Finland and again this is the first of the year Finland kicked off a program
[1:52:00.720 --> 1:52:05.040]  for 2000 citizens said we're going to give them a guaranteed income and this is being sold everywhere
[1:52:05.040 --> 1:52:10.560]  as a universal basic income remember Switzerland had a referendum on this earlier this year and
[1:52:10.560 --> 1:52:16.880]  they said no thanks we don't want that the swiss are still self-reliant enough still independent
[1:52:16.880 --> 1:52:24.400]  enough still wise enough to see what this is this is an effort to make you dependent on the government
[1:52:25.280 --> 1:52:30.800]  I was it was amazing to me to see Charles Murray and of course many of you may not remember who he
[1:52:30.800 --> 1:52:36.640]  is I remember who he was because he was a very respected libertarian economist and he's still
[1:52:36.640 --> 1:52:41.280]  around he wrote a book called Losing Ground and it was a basis for a lot of welfare reformed
[1:52:41.280 --> 1:52:47.920]  during the Reagan administration in that book he made a very clear case that the welfare programs
[1:52:47.920 --> 1:52:52.160]  that have been put in place that were put in there they said out of compassion for people
[1:52:52.720 --> 1:53:01.200]  had actually made people more dependent more passive on government and you know it really
[1:53:01.200 --> 1:53:07.120]  made me sick to see that Charles Murray is now one of those people out there promoting universal
[1:53:07.120 --> 1:53:13.280]  basic income he knows that welfare makes people dependent on the government it makes them weak
[1:53:14.560 --> 1:53:20.720]  and yet he's pushing it why because the next thing coming folks is not a wave of cheap
[1:53:20.720 --> 1:53:24.560]  immigration labor from another foreign country or from central or south america the next wave
[1:53:24.560 --> 1:53:29.520]  that is coming to attack us and of course we have to address that we have to understand that as
[1:53:29.520 --> 1:53:36.320]  obama is bringing in 220 illegal alien children per day as he's escalating the immigration towards
[1:53:36.320 --> 1:53:40.400]  the end of his regime we have to understand that that is i think they worked out the numbers in
[1:53:40.400 --> 1:53:45.920]  just the state in just washington dc area that would be like 12 middle schools that he's adding
[1:53:45.920 --> 1:53:52.560]  each day who's going to pay for the schools you are in your property taxes what's that mean that
[1:53:52.560 --> 1:53:56.480]  means that you're going to be forced to live just as alex was talking about this is agenda 21 folks
[1:53:56.480 --> 1:54:02.640]  you're going to be forced to live in a teeny tiny little 100 or 200 square foot box in a city and
[1:54:02.640 --> 1:54:06.400]  you're not going to be able to get out because they're going to control the transportation
[1:54:06.400 --> 1:54:11.440]  first of all you won't own a car if you own a car you won't be allowed to drive on the roads because
[1:54:11.440 --> 1:54:17.280]  only their robot cars will be allowed to drive you will be considered to be a safety hazard
[1:54:17.840 --> 1:54:21.280]  even if you're not a terrorist that wants to mow people down they'll still say you're too dangerous
[1:54:21.280 --> 1:54:25.680]  to be on the road with our robot cars so you're going to be banned from the roads and that allows
[1:54:25.680 --> 1:54:29.680]  them to keep you in the cities and of course you're not going to be able to afford much of a house
[1:54:29.680 --> 1:54:34.080]  because the property taxes are going to be so high you pay property taxes even if you ran of
[1:54:34.080 --> 1:54:39.200]  course you don't see them itemized but you still pay those property taxes and property taxes are
[1:54:39.200 --> 1:54:45.920]  what are paying for the 12 schools a day that we're adding as barack obama brings these people in
[1:54:45.920 --> 1:54:49.920]  and this is not just even adding a school they're going to be educated in the language of their
[1:54:49.920 --> 1:54:56.880]  choice they don't want them to assimilate they don't want them to become one with the americans
[1:54:56.880 --> 1:55:01.840]  that are already here they want them to remain distinct so they can divide and conquer our country
[1:55:02.400 --> 1:55:06.880]  but when we look at this when we look at the universal basic income and the way that they're
[1:55:06.880 --> 1:55:12.400]  putting they're bringing this up because i know the next wave is going to be massive unemployment
[1:55:12.400 --> 1:55:17.040]  because it's not just going to be manufacturing jobs it's going to be blue collar jobs of every
[1:55:17.040 --> 1:55:20.960]  level it's going to be white collar jobs at every level it's going to be in every industry that
[1:55:20.960 --> 1:55:25.920]  they're going to be replacing you with robots and artificial intelligence that is their plan
[1:55:25.920 --> 1:55:34.000]  that's why they keep looking at these 2020 to 2030 sustainability plans that's where this is all
[1:55:34.000 --> 1:55:41.120]  headed and it is also a massive oppressive tyranny that they're setting up one of these articles
[1:55:41.120 --> 1:55:44.800]  that came out in the last couple weeks was how uber was accusing new york city of snooping on
[1:55:44.800 --> 1:55:50.560]  its own passengers they said hey the new york city police are demanding that we turn over sensitive
[1:55:50.560 --> 1:55:55.840]  passenger information data like where you're dropped off and they want to piece together
[1:55:55.840 --> 1:55:59.840]  details of every trip you ever take what would they get that idea from well it's just like
[1:55:59.840 --> 1:56:05.040]  i was talking about before geospatial intelligence the government wants to know everything that you're
[1:56:05.040 --> 1:56:08.960]  doing and they're plugging it into an algorithm and that algorithm is going to determine whether
[1:56:08.960 --> 1:56:14.560]  or not they think you are a risk and nobody exemplifies this better than uber themselves
[1:56:14.560 --> 1:56:21.360]  it was just a couple of years ago as back in 2014 in november as a matter of fact there were some
[1:56:21.360 --> 1:56:26.480]  concerns because there had been some reported cases of rapes by uber drivers and so people
[1:56:26.480 --> 1:56:30.800]  were saying hey we need to look at the background checks on uber drivers and uber got very upset
[1:56:30.800 --> 1:56:37.120]  buzzfeed reported back in november 2014 that at an off the record dinner an uber executive suggested
[1:56:37.120 --> 1:56:41.600]  that they dig up dirt on journalists they said hey we can get i can hire five or six guys and
[1:56:41.600 --> 1:56:47.280]  spend a couple of million dollars and find out every bit of dirt on this journalist and destroy
[1:56:47.280 --> 1:56:53.120]  them personally and at the same time they removed a blog that they had on the uber website was called
[1:56:53.120 --> 1:56:57.840]  rides of glory and in that they would take a look at the same information that they're now telling
[1:56:57.840 --> 1:57:01.840]  people oh be afraid of the new york city police yeah you should be afraid that new york city wants
[1:57:01.840 --> 1:57:07.360]  this information on you but you should also be afraid that uber keeps it that uber stores it
[1:57:07.360 --> 1:57:12.560]  that uber themselves use this in their blog that they later deleted and i've got a paper
[1:57:12.560 --> 1:57:16.720]  copy of it they called it rides of glory and they took a look at where people were making
[1:57:16.720 --> 1:57:21.840]  trips and they made inferences as to whether or not they were involved in extramarital affairs or
[1:57:21.840 --> 1:57:28.080]  visiting a prostitute now that's the issue behind all this the fact that they can blackmail people
[1:57:28.080 --> 1:57:34.800]  the fact that they can make uh false positives about you saying that you are cheating on somebody
[1:57:34.800 --> 1:57:41.120]  or saying that you are a terrorist based on this metadata that's the pre-crime minority report angle
[1:57:41.120 --> 1:57:46.480]  that is coming with all this as well that's it for today's broadcast join us tomorrow at 11 central
[1:57:46.480 --> 1:58:06.000]  noony string
